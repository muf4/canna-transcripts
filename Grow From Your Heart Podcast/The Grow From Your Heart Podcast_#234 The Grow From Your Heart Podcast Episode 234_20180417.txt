[00:43.560 --> 01:02.000]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.520]  It's time for episode number 85 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:06.520 --> 01:07.520]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:07.520 --> 01:08.520]  That's right.
[01:08.520 --> 01:12.920]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[01:12.920 --> 01:16.200]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist, or if you're someone who's just curious about
[01:16.200 --> 01:19.800]  the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:19.800 --> 01:20.800]  I'm your host.
[01:20.800 --> 01:21.800]  They call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:21.800 --> 01:22.800]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:22.800 --> 01:26.480]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for letting
[01:26.480 --> 01:27.800]  me use their music on the show.
[01:27.800 --> 01:32.040]  Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:32.040 --> 01:33.040]  What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:33.040 --> 01:34.240]  I hope everyone's having a great day.
[01:34.240 --> 01:35.240]  We're coming to you.
[01:35.240 --> 01:39.560]  It's about 7.10 PM, so everyone's sitting here taking some fat dabs at the table.
[01:39.560 --> 01:44.520]  Let me introduce to you our super photography expert, our dab master.
[01:44.520 --> 01:45.920]  I'm just making shit up now.
[01:45.920 --> 01:48.880]  This is our cannabis photography guide for the day.
[01:48.880 --> 01:50.160]  This is my good buddy, Joe, to my left.
[01:50.160 --> 01:51.160]  How are you doing, brother?
[01:51.160 --> 01:52.160]  Welcome to the show.
[01:52.160 --> 01:53.440]  Thank you for having me.
[01:53.440 --> 01:54.840]  I am grateful to be here.
[01:54.840 --> 01:55.840]  Oh, man.
[01:55.840 --> 01:56.840]  It's great having you.
[01:56.840 --> 01:58.400]  Thanks for coming to the ... The studio doesn't have a name.
[01:58.400 --> 02:00.160]  We'll have to make up a name for this very soon.
[02:00.160 --> 02:01.520]  Thanks for coming to my dining room.
[02:01.520 --> 02:03.840]  Yes, the Irie dining room.
[02:03.840 --> 02:05.320]  There we go, the Irie table.
[02:05.320 --> 02:08.760]  I wanted to call it Sticky Knob Studios a long time ago, and somebody told me that that
[02:08.960 --> 02:09.960]  just sounds disgusting.
[02:09.960 --> 02:13.960]  Well, it's because there's hash all over everything now after taking so many dabs.
[02:13.960 --> 02:17.440]  But ladies and gentlemen, directly in front of me, also here joining us on microphone,
[02:17.440 --> 02:18.440]  is my good buddy Sloppy.
[02:18.440 --> 02:19.440]  How are you doing, brother?
[02:19.440 --> 02:20.440]  Doing well, doing well.
[02:20.440 --> 02:21.440]  Glad to be here.
[02:21.440 --> 02:22.440]  Really high.
[02:22.440 --> 02:23.440]  That's nice.
[02:23.440 --> 02:26.920]  Yeah, we're all a little bit high, so there may be some giggles here in this podcast,
[02:26.920 --> 02:27.920]  but it's going to be fun.
[02:27.920 --> 02:31.960]  Well, since we're talking about dabs, this is a good time to give a big shout out to
[02:31.960 --> 02:34.800]  our friend Bobo Blaster Co.
[02:34.800 --> 02:37.920]  This guy calls himself Bobo Blaster Co. on Instagram.
[02:38.080 --> 02:39.080]  He's got a website.
[02:39.080 --> 02:40.080]  Hashtag furniture.
[02:40.080 --> 02:41.080]  There you go.
[02:41.080 --> 02:42.080]  It's furniture.bigcartel.com.
[02:42.080 --> 02:44.760]  You can check it out.
[02:44.760 --> 02:48.400]  This dude makes furniture with an email attached to it, bro.
[02:48.400 --> 02:49.400]  There's nothing cooler.
[02:49.400 --> 02:50.460]  There's nothing better.
[02:50.460 --> 02:54.160]  You can sit at a coffee table, and Slop and I were sitting at the coffee table taking
[02:54.160 --> 02:55.520]  dabs just chatting.
[02:55.520 --> 02:56.520]  It was kind of amazing.
[02:56.520 --> 02:57.520]  It was lovely.
[02:57.520 --> 02:58.520]  Isn't it beautiful?
[02:58.520 --> 02:59.520]  Yeah, it was great.
[02:59.520 --> 03:00.520]  And it's nice.
[03:00.520 --> 03:01.760]  It's beautiful over there.
[03:01.760 --> 03:02.760]  It's gorgeous.
[03:02.760 --> 03:03.760]  It is a sexy table.
[03:03.760 --> 03:05.280]  Dude, I really appreciate you sending me that.
[03:05.280 --> 03:12.160]  I recommend that everybody else checks out furniture.bigcartel.com and follow him on
[03:12.160 --> 03:13.280]  Facebook or on Instagram.
[03:13.280 --> 03:14.760]  It's Bobo Blaster Co.
[03:14.760 --> 03:16.760]  B-O-B-O Blaster Co.
[03:16.760 --> 03:18.880]  Yes, sir.
[03:18.880 --> 03:21.280]  Very creative, very creative Instagram handle.
[03:21.280 --> 03:25.680]  When I meet him this week, I'm going to ask him what he got that from.
[03:25.680 --> 03:26.680]  Let's see.
[03:26.680 --> 03:28.960]  Before we get too far and get too dabbed out, this podcast is brought to you by our good
[03:28.960 --> 03:31.000]  friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.

[04:19.200 --> 04:21.120]  I think that's enough ads, you guys.
[04:21.120 --> 04:22.320]  Let's get down to business.
[04:22.320 --> 04:27.040]  I invited my good buddy Joe over because we want to learn a little bit about cannabis
[04:27.040 --> 04:28.040]  photography.
[04:28.040 --> 04:29.560]  Joe, I got to give you a compliment.
[04:29.560 --> 04:31.760]  You take really great cannabis pictures.
[04:31.760 --> 04:33.040]  Well, thank you very much.
[04:33.080 --> 04:34.080]  I appreciate that.
[04:34.080 --> 04:35.080]  Very, very much.
[04:35.080 --> 04:36.760]  And you called me an expert before.
[04:36.760 --> 04:38.120]  I'm no expert.
[04:38.120 --> 04:42.160]  I'm just an enthusiast who has had a camera for a while.
[04:42.160 --> 04:43.280]  I like that.
[04:43.280 --> 04:44.280]  I like the modesty there.
[04:44.280 --> 04:45.280]  I appreciate that.
[04:45.280 --> 04:48.120]  And I definitely like being corrected on the show.
[04:48.120 --> 04:51.000]  So he's our enthusiast with a lot of experience here.
[04:51.000 --> 04:52.540]  That's what we'll call him, not an expert.
[04:52.540 --> 04:54.840]  So take everything he has with a grain of salt, you guys.
[04:54.840 --> 04:55.840]  I'm just kidding.
[04:55.840 --> 04:56.840]  No, I really do.
[04:56.840 --> 04:58.540]  I trust you and respect your opinion.
[04:58.540 --> 04:59.800]  So that's why I brought you here.
[04:59.800 --> 05:00.800]  And Slob's here.
[05:00.800 --> 05:03.920]  We're going to bring him in once in a while, and then we're going to do this episode.
[05:03.920 --> 05:05.800]  Then we're going to have another fat dab session.
[05:05.800 --> 05:09.240]  Then we're going to record an episode featuring our good buddy Slob over here.
[05:09.240 --> 05:14.520]  So let's jump into the photography with our good buddy who is almost an expert in my opinion,
[05:14.520 --> 05:15.520]  Joe.
[05:15.520 --> 05:17.480]  What we want to do is improve the listener's photography.
[05:17.480 --> 05:19.080]  Did I just say that?
[05:19.080 --> 05:20.080]  Yeah.
[05:20.080 --> 05:22.660]  Anyway, what we want to do is improve their photography.
[05:22.660 --> 05:26.800]  So I guess the main thing that I'll start with is what you guys need to do is think
[05:26.800 --> 05:29.080]  about why are you shooting photography?
[05:29.080 --> 05:30.080]  What's your point?
[05:30.360 --> 05:32.240]  Are you going to do it for advertising?
[05:32.240 --> 05:34.120]  Are you going to do it for magazine shots?
[05:34.120 --> 05:38.400]  Or are you simply just trying to be cool on social media and get a lot of followers?
[05:38.400 --> 05:41.200]  Because that's going to make a huge difference in a lot of the equipment that you need to
[05:41.200 --> 05:42.380]  purchase.
[05:42.380 --> 05:44.960]  So that's pretty much what I came up with.
[05:44.960 --> 05:49.040]  And then I wanted to ask Joe if he could elaborate on that.
[05:49.040 --> 05:55.180]  And then also if he could help us select a camera for our purpose and possibly that fits
[05:55.180 --> 05:56.180]  our budget.
[05:56.180 --> 05:57.180]  Does that make any sense to you, bro?
[05:57.180 --> 05:58.180]  Yeah, most certainly.
[05:58.180 --> 05:59.180]  Awesome.
[05:59.280 --> 06:02.060]  So if you're doing a social media thing, stick with your phone.
[06:02.060 --> 06:04.020]  Your phone is an amazing device.
[06:04.020 --> 06:07.180]  Nine megapixels, 10 megapixels, even more than some.
[06:07.180 --> 06:08.180]  That's ridiculous.
[06:08.180 --> 06:12.420]  As long as you have the proper lighting, that phone will do everything that you need.
[06:12.420 --> 06:16.180]  For the point and shoot, if you're a blogger, somebody who's taking pictures of food or
[06:16.180 --> 06:21.020]  friends, little videos here and there, even if you're filming YouTube videos, point and
[06:21.020 --> 06:22.020]  shoot.
[06:22.020 --> 06:27.700]  You can get a point and shoot two to $500, $600 if you want to really go crazy on them.
[06:28.220 --> 06:34.780]  You can get an amazing blog-worthy, internet-worthy camera, all the capabilities that you need.
[06:34.780 --> 06:39.500]  And then if like you said, advertising and really, really want nice pictures, you can
[06:39.500 --> 06:41.000]  put them on blogs too.
[06:41.000 --> 06:42.200]  Certainly no limits.
[06:42.200 --> 06:47.880]  But if you must have the camera quality, the top camera quality in all aspects, that's
[06:47.880 --> 06:52.340]  definitely the DSLR, a digital single lens reflex camera.
[06:52.340 --> 06:53.340]  Nice.
[06:53.340 --> 06:55.060]  Yeah, that's the way to do it.
[06:55.340 --> 06:58.180]  You guys, there will not be a test, so you don't have to try to remember that.
[06:58.180 --> 06:59.180]  Yes.
[06:59.180 --> 07:00.180]  All right.
[07:00.180 --> 07:02.620]  I don't really know what it means, but I know that that's what it stands for.
[07:02.620 --> 07:03.620]  You know the acronym?
[07:03.620 --> 07:04.620]  Okay.
[07:04.620 --> 07:05.620]  I'm glad I didn't ask.
[07:05.620 --> 07:08.180]  So that's Joe proved the point right there.
[07:08.180 --> 07:09.940]  Just think about what you're shooting for.
[07:09.940 --> 07:12.500]  If you're just trying to be on Instagram, if you're going blogging, you don't need to
[07:12.500 --> 07:14.740]  spend a million dollars on all of your equipment.
[07:14.740 --> 07:17.340]  If you're just trying to shoot some Instagram pictures, if you're trying to be a Twitter
[07:17.340 --> 07:19.820]  guy, if you're doing Facebook, you can use your phone.
[07:19.820 --> 07:24.540]  All of the new iPhones, the Samsung phones, my iPhone 6 takes amazing pictures.
[07:24.540 --> 07:27.260]  All the new phones, you can get really quality pictures.
[07:27.260 --> 07:29.020]  And he said lighting.
[07:29.020 --> 07:31.780]  We'll get into lighting in just a minute.
[07:31.780 --> 07:36.100]  If you guys want to be, you know, I've had a magazine shot and I did not use a super
[07:36.100 --> 07:37.100]  expensive camera.
[07:37.100 --> 07:38.540]  I used a $200 camera for that.
[07:38.540 --> 07:39.780]  So it's not all about the camera.
[07:39.780 --> 07:41.300]  A lot of it is about the settings.
[07:41.300 --> 07:42.780]  A lot of it is about the lighting.
[07:42.780 --> 07:46.980]  A lot of it is about learning where to shoot from and maybe a little bit of editing, but
[07:46.980 --> 07:48.580]  we'll get into that more.
[07:48.580 --> 07:50.420]  So select a camera that fits your budget.
[07:50.420 --> 07:52.220]  Get the best camera you can for your budget.
[07:52.620 --> 07:54.900]  When I first bought my camera, I was intimidated.
[07:54.900 --> 08:00.260]  I bought a point and shoot camera and I feel like I almost, I didn't waste the $200, but
[08:00.260 --> 08:04.940]  if I would have put that money toward my nice DSLR camera in the beginning, I would be further
[08:04.940 --> 08:05.940]  in shooting.
[08:05.940 --> 08:08.820]  Don't be intimidated by a camera with a lot of settings.
[08:08.820 --> 08:12.820]  Most of the new DSLRs, I think all of them have an auto setting.
[08:12.820 --> 08:15.780]  And so you can learn through that auto setting.
[08:15.780 --> 08:19.660]  Most all new cameras are extremely user-friendly.
[08:19.660 --> 08:21.740]  Manufacturers know who they're making cameras for.
[08:21.740 --> 08:24.420]  They know what their audience is.
[08:24.420 --> 08:30.660]  Even if you've never used, as long as you're technology capable, as long as you, yeah,
[08:30.660 --> 08:35.380]  be technology capable, buy any camera you want and you will be able to figure it out.
[08:35.380 --> 08:38.860]  If it's not on your own through experimenting, YouTube.
[08:38.860 --> 08:39.860]  YouTube, definitely.
[08:39.860 --> 08:40.860]  Yeah.
[08:40.860 --> 08:41.860]  YouTube is always a good resource.
[08:41.860 --> 08:46.620]  Just type in this camera and then the question you have about it and it will pop up 17 videos
[08:46.620 --> 08:49.940]  and watch a couple of them and filter out the bullshit because every one of those guys
[08:49.940 --> 08:52.300]  is going to tell you some weird thing that is unnecessary.
[08:52.300 --> 08:55.540]  So just watch three videos and figure out, do the math on that.
[08:55.540 --> 08:56.540]  Get the median.
[08:56.540 --> 08:57.540]  There you go.
[08:57.540 --> 08:58.540]  All right.
[08:58.540 --> 08:59.740]  So select the, figure out why you're going to shoot.
[08:59.740 --> 09:02.220]  Select the best camera you can for your purpose.
[09:02.220 --> 09:05.260]  If you're going to go shooting for Instagram, don't buy a thousand dollar camera.
[09:05.260 --> 09:07.300]  Don't buy the D30 for Instagram shots.
[09:07.300 --> 09:08.660]  Unless you can afford it.
[09:08.660 --> 09:14.260]  And you know, if you want the best pictures on Instagram, you will have the best probably.
[09:14.260 --> 09:15.260]  There you go.
[09:15.260 --> 09:16.260]  Some of the best.
[09:16.260 --> 09:18.020]  If you want the crispest, that's not a word.
[09:18.020 --> 09:20.900]  If you want the crispiest pictures possible.
[09:20.900 --> 09:23.500]  How many times do we have to say a word to make it a word around here?
[09:23.500 --> 09:24.500]  It won't take long.
[09:24.500 --> 09:25.500]  All right.
[09:25.500 --> 09:29.380]  So then select and get the best camera you can, you guys, and then learn it.
[09:29.380 --> 09:33.480]  And also while you're shopping, there are a couple of accessories that we, we talked
[09:33.480 --> 09:34.480]  about this a little bit before.
[09:34.480 --> 09:37.820]  There are definitely some accessories that we would all recommend.
[09:37.820 --> 09:40.020]  While you're shopping, get yourself a tripod.
[09:40.020 --> 09:41.020]  Yes.
[09:41.020 --> 09:43.540]  Don't get a, sorry to interrupt.
[09:43.540 --> 09:45.420]  Don't get a cheap tripod.
[09:45.420 --> 09:49.620]  Like there are tripods out there for 20 and $30, which will work, but they're plastic
[09:49.620 --> 09:54.860]  and they, they're soft and they're not meant to last and they're not meant to really be
[09:54.860 --> 09:56.420]  hauled around and that kind of stuff.
[09:56.420 --> 09:58.580]  And if you're not going to haul it around and you're just going to leave it in one place
[09:58.580 --> 10:01.540]  and take pictures always buy that 20 or $30 one.
[10:01.540 --> 10:06.700]  But the difference between a $30 tripod and a $70 tripod is giant.
[10:06.700 --> 10:07.980]  It's metal.
[10:07.980 --> 10:09.060]  It's very sturdy.
[10:09.060 --> 10:10.440]  It's going to last forever.
[10:10.440 --> 10:12.660]  It will last as many cameras as you could buy.
[10:12.660 --> 10:15.020]  I ruined my $30 tripod quite quickly.
[10:15.620 --> 10:16.620]  The height adjustment stripped out.
[10:16.620 --> 10:17.700]  So it's stuck at one height.
[10:17.700 --> 10:20.020]  If I want to move it up, I got to like yank it.
[10:20.020 --> 10:22.980]  So I've got the $70 Dynex one that they have at Best Buy.
[10:22.980 --> 10:23.980]  Dude, great investment.
[10:23.980 --> 10:24.980]  I agree.
[10:24.980 --> 10:27.860]  The tripod will make your pictures, your photos will be not wobbly.
[10:27.860 --> 10:30.980]  You'll be able to leave the shutter open a little bit longer because you're not holding
[10:30.980 --> 10:34.620]  it and no matter how steady you think you are, you're shaking.
[10:34.620 --> 10:35.620]  Yes.
[10:35.620 --> 10:38.340]  And the way physics works, think about like a flashlight.
[10:38.340 --> 10:40.740]  If you turn the flashlight, you make a nice arc with the light.
[10:40.740 --> 10:41.740]  You're doing that with the lens.
[10:41.740 --> 10:42.780]  You're not just wobbling it.
[10:42.780 --> 10:46.660]  You're waving the whole end of the lens because the part that's shooting is wiggling in a
[10:46.660 --> 10:47.660]  much...
[10:47.660 --> 10:49.460]  Yeah, you're making a cone shape.
[10:49.460 --> 10:50.460]  Sorry, that's science.
[10:50.460 --> 10:51.460]  We'll move on.
[10:51.460 --> 10:52.980]  Also, get yourself a nice case.
[10:52.980 --> 10:56.900]  If you can get a bag, a soft bag or a case or something for the camera, do that because
[10:56.900 --> 10:58.540]  you're going to want to carry extra lenses.
[10:58.540 --> 11:00.260]  You're going to want to carry a lens cleaner.
[11:00.260 --> 11:04.860]  You need a little soft cloth to clean off the lens, especially when shooting cannabis.
[11:04.860 --> 11:08.380]  My lens is freaking sticky all the time.
[11:08.380 --> 11:09.460]  It's I got to clean it off.
[11:09.460 --> 11:13.060]  I get too close to the plants or something and then just you touch it and then it trichomes
[11:13.060 --> 11:14.060]  all over your lens.
[11:14.060 --> 11:15.060]  Old cotton t-shirts.
[11:15.060 --> 11:16.060]  Nothing wrong with that.
[11:16.060 --> 11:17.060]  Okay.
[11:17.060 --> 11:18.060]  No socks.
[11:18.060 --> 11:19.060]  Don't use a sock.
[11:19.060 --> 11:20.060]  Actually, a fresh sock.
[11:20.060 --> 11:21.060]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[11:21.060 --> 11:22.060]  Okay.
[11:22.060 --> 11:25.060]  Anything that's soft, you know, don't use like anything soft.
[11:25.060 --> 11:28.380]  I'm not gonna tell you what not to use, but just is really okay.
[11:28.380 --> 11:30.260]  Don't press too hard to scratch with the lens.
[11:30.260 --> 11:33.860]  And I personally like to go to the sunglasses store and get that little rag that they use
[11:33.860 --> 11:34.860]  to clean your sunglasses.
[11:34.860 --> 11:35.860]  Microfiber cloth.
[11:35.860 --> 11:36.860]  Yes, microfiber.
[11:36.860 --> 11:37.860]  That's what it's called.
[11:37.860 --> 11:38.860]  I think that works perfect for my camera lens.
[11:39.260 --> 11:40.260]  All right.
[11:40.260 --> 11:41.260]  So then don't skimp on the case either.
[11:41.260 --> 11:46.900]  Cases, backpacks, you know, a $70, a $100 case, you know, you're putting a thousand
[11:46.900 --> 11:47.900]  dollar camera in it maybe.
[11:47.900 --> 11:48.900]  True.
[11:48.900 --> 11:49.900]  And a thousand dollar lens.
[11:49.900 --> 11:54.540]  You know, what's a hundred dollar case if versus a $50 case that gets thrown at the
[11:54.540 --> 11:55.540]  airport or something.
[11:55.540 --> 11:56.540]  I don't know.
[11:56.540 --> 11:57.540]  Right.
[11:57.540 --> 12:00.060]  But it's, I'm all about initial investment.
[12:00.060 --> 12:01.060]  I agree.
[12:01.060 --> 12:02.060]  Pelican case.
[12:02.060 --> 12:03.060]  Yeah.
[12:03.060 --> 12:04.060]  You get a pelican case.
[12:04.060 --> 12:06.220]  Pelican case is not too shabby, especially if you're traveling.
[12:06.220 --> 12:11.260]  You know, the best way to not get your camera stolen out of your vehicle when you're traveling,
[12:11.260 --> 12:14.380]  cover it up, hang it on your neck and take pictures with you while you're running around.
[12:14.380 --> 12:16.140]  Take the damn thing with you.
[12:16.140 --> 12:19.980]  Never know when a good, if the craziest shit happens when you don't have your camera with
[12:19.980 --> 12:22.540]  you, you can like almost guarantee you're not going to get robbed.
[12:22.540 --> 12:23.540]  You're not going to get jacked.
[12:23.540 --> 12:26.180]  There won't be a catastrophe if you've got your camera on you.
[12:26.180 --> 12:29.380]  It didn't save Anthony Cumia.
[12:29.380 --> 12:31.140]  That's the greatest reference on this podcast.
[12:31.140 --> 12:34.060]  I think big shout out to Opie and Anthony.
[12:34.060 --> 12:35.060]  That was awesome.
[12:35.060 --> 12:36.060]  That was great.
[12:36.100 --> 12:37.100]  Get yourself a good tripod.
[12:37.100 --> 12:39.060]  Get yourself a good case.
[12:39.060 --> 12:40.060]  Get some lenses now.
[12:40.060 --> 12:43.380]  What kind of lenses for shooting cannabis photography?
[12:43.380 --> 12:44.700]  Could you recommend a few lenses?
[12:44.700 --> 12:49.300]  I don't want to give any like specific lens to get just because everybody, you know, I
[12:49.300 --> 12:50.300]  don't want it to be bad.
[12:50.300 --> 12:51.700]  And then you say, oh, this guy said that.
[12:51.700 --> 12:52.700]  But I love that.
[12:52.700 --> 12:55.300]  But it's, are you trying to take pictures of trichomes?
[12:55.300 --> 12:58.580]  Are you trying to take pictures of buds off the plant on the plant?
[12:58.580 --> 13:01.000]  Do you want to take pictures of the whole plant?
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.680]  Different lenses are going to do different things.
[13:02.680 --> 13:08.480]  You can get, you know, shorter focal length plants or plants, shorter focal length lenses
[13:08.480 --> 13:13.720]  for portraits and, uh, Jen, that's just really general.
[13:13.720 --> 13:17.400]  You can get, uh, all different.
[13:17.400 --> 13:18.400]  There's all different kinds of lenses.
[13:18.400 --> 13:20.480]  It really depends on what you want to do.
[13:20.480 --> 13:22.480]  And each camera is going to have different lenses.
[13:22.480 --> 13:24.040]  Each brand is going to have different lenses.
[13:24.040 --> 13:27.140]  If we're just talking about DSLRs right now, would that, cause that's the only thing that
[13:27.140 --> 13:32.160]  lenses really apply to, uh, your lens.
[13:32.640 --> 13:34.680]  You're buying your lens and your body separate.
[13:34.680 --> 13:38.440]  I mean, if you're buying them in a box together, it's set.
[13:38.440 --> 13:40.020]  You're getting that for a reason.
[13:40.020 --> 13:45.920]  If you're buying the body that you want, because that the body has all the features that you
[13:45.920 --> 13:51.200]  want and then the lens, because that lens has all the features that you want, it depends
[13:51.200 --> 13:52.200]  on what you want to do.
[13:52.200 --> 13:56.200]  So when it says body only, they're sending me a usable camera with no lens, essentially.
[13:56.200 --> 13:57.200]  Okay.
[13:57.200 --> 13:58.200]  Cause that's, that's misleading.
[13:58.200 --> 14:00.120]  I did not know anything about that when I was camera shopping.
[14:00.120 --> 14:01.400]  I was like, what the hell does that mean?
[14:01.400 --> 14:02.400]  Body only.
[14:02.400 --> 14:03.400]  I wonder if there were mechanics inside of there.
[14:03.400 --> 14:04.400]  Oh yeah.
[14:04.400 --> 14:05.400]  It's misleading.
[14:05.400 --> 14:08.680]  Is that like just the plastic or is there, yeah, so now I know that there you go guys,
[14:08.680 --> 14:10.080]  that was a good piece of advice.
[14:10.080 --> 14:14.760]  Um, but that said, you can certainly get lenses that fit all applications.
[14:14.760 --> 14:20.400]  Uh, you can get like the, the telephoto lens, it's telephoto and tele macro.
[14:20.400 --> 14:26.320]  Uh, so you like, I use just as the easy lens for all aspects.
[14:26.320 --> 14:29.400]  I use it, I think it's a 18 to 200.
[14:29.400 --> 14:31.840]  It's a, it's a, it's a Nikon.
[14:31.840 --> 14:32.840]  That's a nice range.
[14:32.840 --> 14:34.320]  It's a huge range.
[14:34.320 --> 14:37.040]  It's and that fits anything that you want.
[14:37.040 --> 14:38.680]  You want to take a picture of a mountain?
[14:38.680 --> 14:39.680]  You're good.
[14:39.680 --> 14:40.680]  You want to take a picture of a tricone?
[14:40.680 --> 14:41.680]  You're good.
[14:41.680 --> 14:49.600]  So that's a huge, I get the 55 to 200 in my case right here.
[14:49.600 --> 14:50.600]  Yeah, there you go.
[14:50.600 --> 14:52.640]  That's, this is my go-to lens right here.
[14:52.640 --> 14:54.560]  This is what I use quite often.
[14:54.560 --> 14:58.200]  Everything that you need it to do without getting too specific.
[14:58.200 --> 14:59.200]  Okay.
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.400]  So guys, what I use, uh, since Joe approves of my setup here, I'm using the Nikon D3200
[15:05.400 --> 15:09.080]  and I bought the package that comes with the case and the two lenses.
[15:09.080 --> 15:11.840]  And I usually use the 55 to 200 lens.
[15:11.840 --> 15:16.080]  Uh, but when I want to get in there, uh, sometimes it's hard to maneuver around the grow room.
[15:16.080 --> 15:20.320]  If you can't back up from the plant, if you're up close, then I'll switch to the, I'm looking
[15:20.320 --> 15:22.880]  at the right number so I don't mislead anybody here.
[15:22.880 --> 15:27.920]  It's the 18 to 55 is the one I use when I can't maneuver around the room too well.
[15:28.120 --> 15:30.200]  If I'm further away, I go for this longer lens.
[15:30.200 --> 15:32.760]  If I'm close in tight, I use the 18 to 55.
[15:32.760 --> 15:36.240]  I get much better shots with this, uh, 55 to 200 lens.
[15:36.240 --> 15:37.520]  This is my go-to right here.
[15:37.520 --> 15:45.120]  So when we're saying all of this, um, basically you, to take the macro shots on that 55 to
[15:45.120 --> 15:51.200]  200, you put it all the way to 200 and on a tripod and you're going to be about 18,
[15:51.760 --> 15:58.080]  20 inches away from the nug, uh, with your 200 zoomed all the way out into that nugg.
[15:58.080 --> 16:02.080]  And that's how you're getting your macro shots in that specific zoomed all the way out or
[16:02.080 --> 16:02.640]  all the way in.
[16:03.440 --> 16:08.960]  Well, you're zoomed into what you're trying to, your 200 is extended as far as it will
[16:08.960 --> 16:09.200]  go.
[16:09.200 --> 16:11.360]  If you're, you set it to 200.
[16:11.360 --> 16:17.040]  So the lens is out super long and on your viewfinder, it's zoomed in on your subject.
[16:17.040 --> 16:17.840]  Okay.
[16:17.840 --> 16:22.480]  And then that's where you find your macro setting in that lens.
[16:22.480 --> 16:22.800]  Nice.
[16:23.680 --> 16:28.400]  Yeah, that's so that's, but that's in these types of lenses that do everything.
[16:28.400 --> 16:30.320]  I think I've been off the mic for so much of this.
[16:30.320 --> 16:31.440]  Oh no, I've got you up loud enough.
[16:31.440 --> 16:32.000]  Okay, cool.
[16:32.000 --> 16:32.720]  I can get you in there.
[16:32.720 --> 16:35.440]  The, but that, that's, so those are my mics.
[16:35.440 --> 16:37.840]  Those are lenses that do everything.
[16:37.840 --> 16:44.240]  If you want to take pictures of just the trichomes, you know, really close up things going on
[16:44.240 --> 16:46.800]  in your garden, you could take, you know, awesome pictures of soil.
[16:47.120 --> 16:48.240]  What you'll find in there.
[16:48.240 --> 16:52.560]  You could take pictures of a whole nugs trichomes.
[16:52.560 --> 16:53.840]  That's really what you're looking for.
[16:53.840 --> 16:58.960]  You want to get like a dedicated macro lens, something that won't take pictures of mountains,
[16:58.960 --> 17:04.960]  something that won't take pictures of your family, no portraits, just little tiny stuff,
[17:04.960 --> 17:06.240]  just little things.
[17:06.240 --> 17:06.880]  Okay.
[17:06.880 --> 17:10.000]  But yeah, get the right lens for the right job is kind of what you're trying to say.
[17:10.000 --> 17:11.040]  Do your research.
[17:11.040 --> 17:13.520]  Look for something that's going to shoot in five to one.
[17:14.320 --> 17:20.000]  That's all about a full, full resolution on big prints, essentially.
[17:20.000 --> 17:20.240]  Okay.
[17:22.160 --> 17:28.960]  Like if you have an eight by 11 picture of a trichome and it's perfectly in focus and
[17:28.960 --> 17:35.360]  beautiful, that's because somebody was using like a five to one lens that would allow you
[17:35.360 --> 17:38.800]  to shoot that whole frame.
[17:38.800 --> 17:39.120]  Okay.
[17:39.120 --> 17:39.920]  That makes sense.
[17:39.920 --> 17:40.720]  I get it.
[17:40.720 --> 17:42.000]  You're zoomed into life.
[17:42.320 --> 17:43.520]  You're zoomed into real life.
[17:44.640 --> 17:48.160]  So basically people got to know what they're aiming for and that can lead us into another
[17:48.160 --> 17:48.800]  part of this.
[17:48.800 --> 17:53.200]  We're going to kind of skip a little part of the notes that we made, but instead of just,
[17:53.200 --> 17:54.080]  no, no, I like it.
[17:54.080 --> 17:54.880]  I like it when it flows.
[17:54.880 --> 17:55.920]  I'm getting so off track here.
[17:55.920 --> 17:56.480]  No, I like it.
[17:56.480 --> 17:58.400]  I'm the one skipping it because I like the way that it's flowing.
[17:58.400 --> 17:58.880]  It flows better.
[17:58.880 --> 18:03.520]  We'll do that instead of just shooting at random shit, kind of plan out your shot.
[18:03.520 --> 18:04.480]  Also, that's a good thing.
[18:04.480 --> 18:05.120]  That's a good point.
[18:05.120 --> 18:08.560]  Since he goes talking about your lens, you're going to have to know what you're aiming for
[18:08.560 --> 18:10.640]  when you put this lens on your camera.
[18:10.640 --> 18:14.560]  You can't go putting on your macro lens and then try to take a picture of the top Cola.
[18:14.560 --> 18:17.680]  You got to get your 200 lens out to take pictures of the top.
[18:17.680 --> 18:20.720]  You kind of know what you're aiming for, plan your shot.
[18:20.720 --> 18:25.040]  And like, think about, like Joe said, if you want to take a picture of a tricone, or if
[18:25.040 --> 18:28.720]  you want to take a picture of some soil, think about it and you'll, you'll see it when you
[18:28.720 --> 18:30.720]  walk through the grow room, something will go right here.
[18:30.720 --> 18:31.200]  Look at this.
[18:31.200 --> 18:34.800]  And when it catches your eye, that means it catches the camera and try to stand where
[18:34.800 --> 18:36.000]  you were when it got your eye.
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.160]  Try to try to replicate that a little bit.
[18:38.160 --> 18:43.440]  Don't, uh, don't be scared to take a lot of pictures of even the same thing.
[18:43.440 --> 18:47.120]  And then, you know, there'll be that one that's just like, this is the one.
[18:47.120 --> 18:50.160]  Like if you have the time to, you know, I don't know, take some dabs and look through
[18:50.160 --> 18:52.480]  your pictures, like the magic of memory cards.
[18:53.200 --> 18:53.600]  Exactly.
[18:53.600 --> 18:54.880]  We're not wasting film anymore.
[18:54.880 --> 18:56.320]  We're just clicking away on a memory card.
[18:56.320 --> 19:00.080]  We're wasting RAM and we can delete it all and do it all over again tomorrow.
[19:00.080 --> 19:01.280]  So yeah, just plan out your shot.
[19:01.920 --> 19:03.200]  Choose the right lens for your shot.
[19:03.200 --> 19:03.440]  Yeah.
[19:03.440 --> 19:09.360]  And on just, just to make a correction on that with the 200, the 55 to 200, when you're
[19:09.360 --> 19:13.520]  at 200, I don't want anybody to think that you can take a picture of a trichome with
[19:13.520 --> 19:14.320]  the 200.
[19:14.320 --> 19:15.200]  It won't work that way.
[19:15.200 --> 19:15.360]  Yeah.
[19:15.360 --> 19:16.240]  I was kind of thinking that.
[19:16.240 --> 19:18.080]  You can take a picture.
[19:18.080 --> 19:22.000]  You can take really close up, good shots of nugs on your plant.
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.920]  You can take where you will see each individual trichome as a dot.
[19:25.920 --> 19:29.840]  Sometimes the stock, just depending on how good the lighting is, but don't think you're
[19:29.840 --> 19:36.960]  going to get that real super official macro photography with, without a macro specific
[19:36.960 --> 19:37.280]  lens.
[19:37.840 --> 19:39.920]  And I just wrote something down to try not to forget it.
[19:40.960 --> 19:44.320]  We're going to go into lighting next because you just hinted on that, but you guys, one
[19:44.320 --> 19:48.960]  huge hint I can give you just super quickly, get yourself either a method seven lens or
[19:48.960 --> 19:50.000]  I totally forgot about those.
[19:50.000 --> 19:50.080]  Yeah.
[19:50.080 --> 19:51.280]  We both forgot about them.
[19:51.280 --> 19:52.160]  I have them.
[19:52.160 --> 19:52.800]  They're amazing.
[19:52.800 --> 19:52.960]  Yeah.
[19:52.960 --> 19:56.160]  So get your, it's either, or you can just put the sunglasses right over your camera.
[19:56.160 --> 19:57.600]  If you're ghetto, you can do that too.
[19:57.600 --> 19:58.080]  That works.
[19:58.720 --> 20:00.000]  But yeah, that does work.
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.120]  Method seven makes a filter that cuts out the, the HID, the high intensity discharge
[20:05.120 --> 20:05.360]  light.
[20:05.360 --> 20:08.320]  It cuts that color out and you can see the natural color of your plants.
[20:08.320 --> 20:12.160]  So if you're not able to take the plants out of the room, the method seven lens is a good
[20:12.160 --> 20:12.880]  way to go.
[20:12.880 --> 20:14.800]  So let's work into lighting a little bit.
[20:14.800 --> 20:18.400]  How should we be lighting our cannabis plants when we're taking pictures?
[20:18.400 --> 20:20.320]  Ideally not around HPS lights.
[20:21.200 --> 20:22.400]  Not even T5 lights.
[20:22.400 --> 20:23.200]  That's not true light.
[20:23.200 --> 20:24.320]  I mean, it's super white.
[20:24.320 --> 20:28.480]  It looks good, but it's not the true representation of your plant.
[20:28.480 --> 20:28.720]  Okay.
[20:29.520 --> 20:30.960]  It puts a little bit of a blue to it.
[20:30.960 --> 20:31.680]  I've noticed.
[20:31.680 --> 20:32.160]  Certainly.
[20:32.160 --> 20:38.320]  It could put any hue on it just depending on the other lights in the room or a number
[20:38.320 --> 20:38.880]  of factors.
[20:38.880 --> 20:39.840]  What it's reflecting from.
[20:39.840 --> 20:40.240]  Yeah.
[20:40.240 --> 20:40.720]  Okay.
[20:40.720 --> 20:47.680]  So your lighting, what's easiest, you know, get in a room with really good outside lighting
[20:47.680 --> 20:50.400]  or, you know, a whole bunch of CFLs.
[20:50.400 --> 20:54.960]  They're pretty, pretty flat white, easy to color balance off of your camera.
[20:54.960 --> 20:57.360]  If you want to get into your settings and do that, but that's ideal.
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.680]  If you don't have that and you have to stay in your grow room, you know, turn the HPS
[21:01.680 --> 21:06.400]  lights off and just turn your overhead light on and use a flash.
[21:06.400 --> 21:07.040]  Okay.
[21:07.040 --> 21:09.520]  A flash will overcome a lot.
[21:09.520 --> 21:14.320]  Is the, uh, the stock flash that came on most of our DSL cameras is going to be DSLR cameras.
[21:14.320 --> 21:15.120]  Is that going to be good enough?
[21:15.120 --> 21:18.320]  Or should we get like a ring, like a, like an aftermarket flash?
[21:18.320 --> 21:23.440]  If you can afford an aftermarket flash, it is going to be a lot far superior to the one
[21:23.440 --> 21:27.760]  built in, but that one that's built in is not too shabby either.
[21:27.760 --> 21:30.800]  It will definitely get the job done for most applications.
[21:30.800 --> 21:35.760]  When you're getting an aftermarket flash, you should really know why you're about to
[21:35.760 --> 21:37.920]  spend $160 on a flash.
[21:37.920 --> 21:40.160]  Like there's, there's, there's reasons for it.
[21:40.160 --> 21:44.240]  I don't want to tell you what they are because that's cheating.
[21:44.240 --> 21:45.120]  Figure out the reason.
[21:45.120 --> 21:45.440]  Nice.
[21:45.920 --> 21:46.000]  Yeah.
[21:47.040 --> 21:48.240]  But we'll get to some reasons later.
[21:49.520 --> 21:50.160]  All right.
[21:50.160 --> 21:52.480]  So more lighting is usually the key, right?
[21:52.480 --> 21:55.440]  More lighting, more lighting, the better sunlight, if you can.
[21:55.440 --> 21:59.840]  Sunlight's the most ideal, but I know everybody can't take their plants outside.
[21:59.840 --> 22:00.080]  Yeah.
[22:00.080 --> 22:03.360]  My favorite meme is the old lady looking out the window and it says, there's my neighbor
[22:03.360 --> 22:05.600]  taking pictures of his bongs in the sunlight again.
[22:05.600 --> 22:06.560]  That's fantastic.
[22:06.560 --> 22:06.800]  Yeah.
[22:06.800 --> 22:06.960]  Yeah.
[22:06.960 --> 22:08.240]  You see it on Instagram all the time.
[22:08.240 --> 22:12.800]  Well, I do because I follow usually pot plants, glass and pit bulls as my Instagram feed.
[22:13.120 --> 22:15.840]  And ladies.
[22:15.840 --> 22:18.080]  And some ladies.
[22:18.080 --> 22:18.720]  Yeah, you're right.
[22:18.720 --> 22:19.280]  I'll be honest.
[22:19.280 --> 22:19.920]  And some booties.
[22:21.520 --> 22:22.240]  All right.
[22:22.240 --> 22:23.680]  Let's, let's try to get back on track slot.
[22:23.680 --> 22:24.000]  Come on.
[22:25.360 --> 22:26.720]  So I wrote down settings.
[22:26.720 --> 22:31.040]  What kind of settings should I throw my, is it cool to just walk in there on auto and
[22:31.040 --> 22:32.320]  just start auto firing or who?
[22:32.320 --> 22:32.880]  Absolutely.
[22:32.880 --> 22:33.680]  That's totally fine.
[22:33.680 --> 22:34.560]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[22:34.560 --> 22:35.360]  You'll get pictures.
[22:35.360 --> 22:37.120]  It'll be, it'll be useful.
[22:37.120 --> 22:41.120]  They might not be the best, but they're certainly will be usable compared to.
[22:41.920 --> 22:45.600]  If you just throw it in manual without knowing anything, you know, it'll probably just be
[22:45.600 --> 22:45.920]  black.
[22:47.120 --> 22:54.080]  But settings you, you, when you don't have ideal, I'd say throw it in auto from the most
[22:54.080 --> 22:54.320]  of it.
[22:54.320 --> 22:56.400]  There's no, there's no reason to not use auto.
[22:56.400 --> 23:02.960]  If you have great lighting, auto is the best setting just because it will continually correct.
[23:02.960 --> 23:05.120]  It will just make everything easy and pretty.
[23:05.120 --> 23:09.120]  And you can focus on taking the pictures, especially if you're not getting paid.
[23:09.120 --> 23:13.920]  Like you don't need to be 1000% perfect on everything.
[23:13.920 --> 23:14.400]  Very true.
[23:14.400 --> 23:18.320]  If they're just for your Instagram feed, you don't need to be all critical about it.
[23:18.320 --> 23:20.560]  Of course, if you want to be critical, more power to you.
[23:20.560 --> 23:20.720]  Yeah.
[23:20.720 --> 23:21.440]  That's part of the art.
[23:21.440 --> 23:22.240]  If you're into that.
[23:22.240 --> 23:26.400]  The settings, uh, you, so settings are going to be for what, if you want to take pictures
[23:26.400 --> 23:32.320]  in the dark, just using flash randomly to overcome the HPS or when the HPSs are on and
[23:32.320 --> 23:37.520]  you have to change the setting in your camera to filter out that on the fly.
[23:38.480 --> 23:39.760]  Don't be afraid to change settings.
[23:39.760 --> 23:41.760]  You guys, it's something you're going to have to learn to do with the camera.
[23:41.760 --> 23:46.400]  It's something I've just recently accepted is that every shot I may have to change a
[23:46.400 --> 23:46.720]  setting.
[23:47.360 --> 23:48.720]  I didn't realize it was going to be that way.
[23:48.720 --> 23:52.080]  When I started taking photos, I thought I could just go in there and put it on, you
[23:52.080 --> 23:55.200]  know, put the after setting here, turn the ISO to here, put the white balance here and
[23:55.200 --> 23:56.560]  just go in there and shoot from every angle.
[23:56.560 --> 23:57.360]  And it'd be legit.
[23:57.360 --> 24:03.040]  But you want to shoot from, you want to take all the pictures you want to take from the,
[24:03.760 --> 24:05.600]  without moving basically.
[24:05.600 --> 24:05.840]  Yeah.
[24:06.400 --> 24:09.520]  Stand in one spot, take all the pictures you want to take, move to the next spot, take
[24:09.520 --> 24:11.920]  all the pictures you want to take and do it systematically.
[24:11.920 --> 24:12.160]  Okay.
[24:12.960 --> 24:17.200]  I mean, I'm not trying to tell anybody what to do, but that's what I find, especially
[24:17.200 --> 24:20.400]  when you're going through your pictures and everything is grouped.
[24:20.400 --> 24:24.320]  I mean, you're going to be sitting down, standing up, leaning over, leaning backwards
[24:24.960 --> 24:26.720]  in one spot without moving too much.
[24:26.720 --> 24:30.560]  So you can really get a good feel of what that angle is bringing to the table.
[24:30.560 --> 24:30.800]  Yeah.
[24:30.800 --> 24:32.240]  And don't be afraid to take weird angles.
[24:32.240 --> 24:34.240]  You guys, some of the best shots are really weird angles.
[24:34.240 --> 24:35.440]  Yeah, experiment, have fun.
[24:35.440 --> 24:38.000]  Hang off of a ladder upside down backwards and take a picture.
[24:38.800 --> 24:39.280]  That's right.
[24:39.280 --> 24:39.520]  Yeah.
[24:39.520 --> 24:40.960]  Good shit comes out of there.
[24:40.960 --> 24:41.280]  All right.
[24:41.280 --> 24:42.640]  So we talked about settings a little bit.
[24:42.640 --> 24:44.320]  We got lighting, we got lens selection.
[24:45.200 --> 24:47.360]  Sloppy brought up a great point earlier.
[24:47.360 --> 24:52.800]  Slop asked me, what is acceptable editing for cannabis photography?
[24:52.800 --> 24:54.000]  And Joe had a great answer.
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.360]  I'll let you give that answer.
[24:55.360 --> 24:58.320]  It's just don't, don't edit maliciously.
[24:58.320 --> 24:58.880]  Yes.
[24:58.880 --> 25:01.920]  By that Joe means like myself, I'm a seed breeder, right?
[25:01.920 --> 25:02.640]  I own a company.
[25:02.640 --> 25:03.520]  I try to sell seeds.
[25:03.520 --> 25:07.280]  If I were to edit the photos I take of the plants that come from my seeds,
[25:07.280 --> 25:08.720]  I feel like it would be misleading.
[25:09.280 --> 25:10.480]  I edited out the background.
[25:10.480 --> 25:11.440]  I edited out people.
[25:11.440 --> 25:12.800]  I edited out other plants.
[25:12.800 --> 25:15.440]  If there's another plant next to it, I'll go ahead and blur that one.
[25:15.440 --> 25:18.720]  But I don't edit the subject at all most of the time.
[25:18.720 --> 25:23.600]  Like 99% of my Instagram and my website are all unedited.
[25:23.600 --> 25:27.200]  And if they are edited, you can tell because it's black and white or it's something awkward.
[25:27.920 --> 25:31.120]  But if you're in there making the pistols pink and you're trying to sell a pack of seeds
[25:31.120 --> 25:33.680]  and those pistols weren't pink, that's what we'll call malicious editing.
[25:33.680 --> 25:34.400]  Don't do that shit.
[25:34.400 --> 25:37.440]  But if you're doing it for art, like if you're doing it for like,
[25:37.440 --> 25:39.200]  look at this beautiful cannabis plant, that's cool.
[25:39.200 --> 25:42.000]  But if you're trying to take credit for growing this beautiful plant,
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.920]  don't go fucking with the colors of misleading people.
[25:43.920 --> 25:44.880]  Don't false advertise.
[25:44.880 --> 25:46.480]  Don't try to trick anyone.
[25:46.480 --> 25:47.280]  Yeah.
[25:47.280 --> 25:47.840]  And that's all.
[25:47.840 --> 25:48.320]  That's all.
[25:48.320 --> 25:49.200]  Damn tricksters.
[25:49.200 --> 25:50.240]  Editing is a lot of fun though.
[25:50.240 --> 25:51.520]  Oh, editing is great.
[25:51.520 --> 25:54.800]  And there are certain instances when you have to edit.
[25:55.360 --> 26:00.240]  Like if you weren't, you know, you're not always in the best condition for pictures.
[26:00.240 --> 26:00.560]  Right.
[26:00.560 --> 26:03.760]  You don't always have the best opportunity to take a picture.
[26:04.560 --> 26:07.040]  Sometimes you just have to snap, snap, snap, snap.
[26:07.040 --> 26:08.000]  You've got to brighten it up.
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.040]  And then you've got to come back to some Photoshop and clean it up.
[26:11.040 --> 26:11.440]  Yep.
[26:11.440 --> 26:12.720]  Which is acceptable at that point.
[26:12.720 --> 26:14.160]  It just depends on what you're doing with it.
[26:14.720 --> 26:15.520]  Yeah, I agree.
[26:15.520 --> 26:16.240]  All right.
[26:16.240 --> 26:22.400]  So now that you've learned how to select a camera, you've got all your accessories.
[26:22.400 --> 26:24.320]  You figured out what kind of lenses you're going to use.
[26:24.320 --> 26:25.680]  You got a cool light to play with.
[26:26.400 --> 26:27.920]  You've been tweaking on the camera settings.
[26:27.920 --> 26:29.360]  You learned how to do some editing.
[26:29.360 --> 26:32.720]  Now you just got to get there in a grow room or wherever your plants are and just take a
[26:32.720 --> 26:33.680]  shitload of pictures.
[26:33.680 --> 26:38.400]  You guys just take pictures, change the settings, play with the settings.
[26:38.400 --> 26:38.960]  Don't be afraid.
[26:38.960 --> 26:41.280]  Like I said earlier, don't be afraid to get out of auto.
[26:41.280 --> 26:45.920]  If you get out of auto mode, I like to take pictures in auto and then take a note on where
[26:45.920 --> 26:46.960]  what auto did.
[26:46.960 --> 26:48.240]  Auto will say everything.
[26:48.240 --> 26:53.360]  Auto put the ISO at this or the white balance or the shutter speed or the aperture setting
[26:53.360 --> 26:53.680]  was here.
[26:54.320 --> 26:57.120]  Auto will take a note for you in the photo if you save it right.
[26:57.120 --> 26:59.200]  And then look at that note and then write that down.
[26:59.200 --> 27:03.520]  And then if you've got a really killer picture, try to duplicate that setting in that environment.
[27:03.520 --> 27:07.680]  And then remember, like when I was in this setting, this environment last time I threw
[27:07.680 --> 27:09.840]  on this setting and I took really killer pictures.
[27:09.840 --> 27:11.520]  And then you'll start making mental notes of it.
[27:11.520 --> 27:13.600]  You'll just, it'll start coming naturally to you.
[27:13.600 --> 27:14.800]  That's really nifty.
[27:14.800 --> 27:15.760]  That's, that's crazy.
[27:15.760 --> 27:16.960]  I didn't know that it did that.
[27:16.960 --> 27:17.200]  Yeah.
[27:17.200 --> 27:21.040]  If it shows on the camera, if you, if you save it, if you've got a decent camera, a good
[27:21.040 --> 27:24.080]  expensive camera, it'll show you what the settings were when you take it.
[27:24.080 --> 27:28.000]  And unfortunately, a lot of those cameras are also putting a GPS locations in there.
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.400]  So you got to go turn that setting off in your camera.
[27:30.400 --> 27:31.600]  That's a good tip.
[27:31.600 --> 27:32.960]  You guys turn off.
[27:32.960 --> 27:33.120]  Yeah.
[27:33.120 --> 27:35.040]  You don't want location is the future.
[27:35.040 --> 27:35.280]  Yeah.
[27:35.280 --> 27:36.480]  So shut that off.
[27:36.480 --> 27:36.960]  Yes.
[27:36.960 --> 27:38.800]  No good metadata in your camera.
[27:38.800 --> 27:40.000]  You don't want that.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.400]  So, uh, and then go take pictures, you guys, and then just start planning out better shots.
[27:44.400 --> 27:45.440]  Just start shooting more.
[27:45.440 --> 27:46.720]  And then you'll learn how to set it.
[27:46.720 --> 27:48.160]  You'll learn how to get to a better setting.
[27:48.160 --> 27:51.920]  You learn how to plan out your shot, frame your shot, and then you'll learn more how
[27:51.920 --> 27:52.800]  to edit them.
[27:52.800 --> 27:56.720]  And then I think that'll put you on the way to making amazing photography.
[27:56.720 --> 28:03.040]  And then you can have 17 to 25 to 55,000 followers on Instagram and you can be in the club.
[28:04.400 --> 28:05.600]  Take notes when you do it.
[28:05.600 --> 28:06.080]  There you go.
[28:06.080 --> 28:06.400]  Slop.
[28:06.400 --> 28:08.560]  How many Instagram followers do you have over there?
[28:09.520 --> 28:12.560]  I think I have like 1734.
[28:14.960 --> 28:15.280]  Yeah.
[28:15.280 --> 28:16.240]  Well, it's pretty good, man.
[28:16.240 --> 28:17.520]  I remember when you moved here.
[28:17.520 --> 28:18.160]  Oh yeah.
[28:18.160 --> 28:18.560]  Yeah.
[28:18.560 --> 28:19.760]  Like 400.
[28:20.560 --> 28:22.080]  So you've gone a long way.
[28:22.080 --> 28:22.400]  All right.
[28:22.400 --> 28:25.280]  I feel like I've covered all of the notes that I've written down.
[28:25.280 --> 28:28.240]  I see that Joe's got a little, uh, uh, what do you call it?
[28:28.240 --> 28:29.440]  Bullet point thing over there.
[28:29.440 --> 28:29.600]  Yeah.
[28:29.600 --> 28:30.320]  Show them something.
[28:30.320 --> 28:30.560]  Yeah.
[28:30.560 --> 28:30.800]  Yeah.
[28:30.800 --> 28:34.960]  The only thing really that I would want to say is use the internet.
[28:34.960 --> 28:40.320]  It's an amazing resource for everything, you know, anything that you want to learn about
[28:40.320 --> 28:42.560]  anything, especially photography is out there.
[28:42.560 --> 28:46.880]  There's a lot of people who have blogs and YouTube channels.
[28:46.880 --> 28:49.520]  I like a guy that calls himself Fro Grows.
[28:49.520 --> 28:50.160]  I think.
[28:50.160 --> 28:50.400]  Okay.
[28:50.400 --> 28:52.320]  He's got a YouTube channel on photography.
[28:53.040 --> 28:57.200]  A lot of photographers are kind of stale to watch because they're good at photography
[28:57.200 --> 28:58.800]  and not personal presentation.
[28:58.800 --> 28:59.040]  Yeah.
[28:59.040 --> 29:02.800]  But Fro Grows is definitely educational and entertaining.
[29:02.800 --> 29:03.760]  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[29:03.760 --> 29:04.640]  No, absolutely.
[29:04.640 --> 29:11.200]  That's all I'm saying is find somebody that you can watch and watch them work.
[29:11.200 --> 29:12.400]  You can learn a lot from them.
[29:12.400 --> 29:12.880]  Yeah.
[29:12.880 --> 29:15.280]  You can, it's such a crash course sometimes on YouTube.
[29:15.280 --> 29:17.280]  They just show you exactly what you want to see.
[29:17.840 --> 29:18.320]  All right.
[29:18.320 --> 29:19.840]  Islop, you got anything to say over there, bro?
[29:19.840 --> 29:20.480]  You look blazed.
[29:21.040 --> 29:21.520]  Yeah.
[29:21.520 --> 29:26.400]  Don't be scared to use your imagination and just get in the grow room and get down on
[29:26.400 --> 29:30.320]  one knee or look at it from a weird angle, take pictures from inside the plant.
[29:30.320 --> 29:32.000]  Like really get in there.
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.160]  The possibilities for pictures are endless.
[29:34.160 --> 29:35.280]  Like do it.
[29:35.280 --> 29:37.680]  Your imagination is the only limit.
[29:37.680 --> 29:37.920]  Yeah.
[29:37.920 --> 29:39.520]  Yo, and imagination is key.
[29:40.560 --> 29:40.960]  All right, guys.
[29:40.960 --> 29:42.400]  I think we've got a great podcast here.
[29:42.400 --> 29:44.240]  We should start wrapping this up while we're ahead, right?
[29:44.960 --> 29:45.760]  Surely.
[29:45.760 --> 29:46.080]  All right.
[29:46.080 --> 29:46.400]  All right.
[29:46.400 --> 29:48.480]  You guys, we're going to be back in a couple of days.
[29:48.480 --> 29:52.640]  We're going to do another episode with Sloppy and then I've got a couple other things planned
[29:52.640 --> 29:53.280]  out.
[29:53.280 --> 29:55.360]  So I'm going to wrap up the show and take some dabs.

[30:31.680 --> 30:35.840]  I'm not going to say no matter what you write, but almost no matter what you write, iTunes
[30:35.840 --> 30:37.200]  will filter out any crazy shit.
[30:37.200 --> 30:37.520]  So.
[30:37.520 --> 30:38.400]  You'd think so.
[30:38.400 --> 30:39.360]  I would hope so.
[30:39.360 --> 30:40.080]  So we'll see.
[30:40.080 --> 30:41.280]  Let's see what you guys can get through.

[30:49.760 --> 30:51.920]  Make sure you follow me on all the social media sites, you guys.
[30:51.920 --> 30:53.360]  I'm on Facebook.
[30:53.360 --> 30:54.160]  It's Grow From Your Heart.
[30:54.160 --> 30:56.480]  I'm on Instagram under iRead Genetics.
[30:56.480 --> 30:57.280]  I'm on Twitter.
[30:57.280 --> 30:58.880]  It's at GFYH Podcast.
[30:58.880 --> 31:01.280]  You guys, I'm so addicted to Periscope.
[31:01.280 --> 31:03.440]  I think everybody in this room is addicted to Periscope.
[31:03.440 --> 31:05.840]  Periscope is an app for your iPhone or your Android device.
[31:05.840 --> 31:07.280]  I've been talking about it quite heavily.
[31:07.840 --> 31:10.000]  I'm going to have to take the needle out at some point.
[31:10.000 --> 31:10.800]  It's such a good thing.
[31:10.800 --> 31:11.520]  Nah.
[31:11.520 --> 31:12.400]  You guys keep doing it.
[31:12.400 --> 31:13.200]  It's amazing.
[31:13.200 --> 31:13.520]  All right.
[31:13.520 --> 31:14.640]  I think it's awesome.
[31:14.640 --> 31:15.680]  I go on Periscope.
[31:15.920 --> 31:20.960]  I go on Periscope once or twice a day and just ramble on about random shit that's happening
[31:20.960 --> 31:22.000]  in my life.
[31:22.000 --> 31:25.760]  I give words of wisdom and I also just talk about growing plants.
[31:25.760 --> 31:26.560]  It's pretty fun.
[31:26.560 --> 31:27.760]  And slay trolls.
[31:27.760 --> 31:28.320]  So check that.
[31:28.320 --> 31:29.440]  Dude, I slay the trolls.
[31:29.440 --> 31:32.320]  I got my troll-proof panties on.
[31:32.320 --> 31:32.960]  I ain't scared.
[31:33.520 --> 31:33.920]  All right.
[31:33.920 --> 31:37.600]  I better not say all that because I just challenge people to leave comments and say I'm troll-proof.
[31:37.600 --> 31:38.320]  This is going to get dirty.
[31:38.320 --> 31:39.280]  They're coming for you now.
[31:39.280 --> 31:39.840]  Yes, they are.
[31:39.840 --> 31:40.560]  There's no stopping this.
[31:40.560 --> 31:41.840]  I got the ban hammer, bro.
[31:41.840 --> 31:42.560]  I'm not scared.
[31:43.600 --> 31:43.920]  All right.
[31:43.920 --> 31:46.000]  You guys, don't forget that the show is available on iTunes.
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.240]  The show is available on Stitcher and every single episode is always and forever archived
[31:50.240 --> 31:52.480]  on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[31:53.120 --> 31:56.320]  Don't forget we added that donation button to the podcast page.

[32:07.120 --> 32:08.880]  I'm never going to charge you guys for the podcast.
[32:08.880 --> 32:10.560]  The show is always going to be free.
[32:10.560 --> 32:15.200]  Right now, I'm trying to buy a Zoom H6 so that I can take the podcast on the road,
[32:15.200 --> 32:18.400]  go do more recording with the Terpy Boys, the Terpex crew with Hunt.
[32:19.040 --> 32:20.320]  I'll take the show to more events.
[32:20.320 --> 32:23.280]  We'll do some more shit if I have a mobile device that I can rely on.
[32:24.000 --> 32:24.880]  It'll be awesome.
[32:24.880 --> 32:27.920]  So if you want to contribute, I would give you a big shout out on the show.
[32:28.640 --> 32:30.160]  Make sure you follow me on all the social media.
[32:30.160 --> 32:31.200]  I already begged for all that.
[32:31.760 --> 32:33.600]  You guys, I want to thank my guests for joining me.
[32:33.600 --> 32:34.400]  Awesome show, you guys.
[32:34.400 --> 32:35.360]  I really appreciate it.
[32:35.360 --> 32:36.240]  That was a lot of fun.
[32:36.240 --> 32:37.040]  It was a lot of fun.
[32:37.040 --> 32:37.840]  Thanks for having us.
[32:37.840 --> 32:38.240]  Oh, man.
[32:38.240 --> 32:39.040]  You guys will be back.
[32:39.040 --> 32:40.080]  We're going to record some more.
[32:40.800 --> 32:42.240]  Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[32:42.240 --> 32:44.160]  He's got the coolest tattoo I've ever seen.
[32:44.160 --> 32:46.880]  He's got a tattoo of his dog, Nani, on the back of his arm.
[32:46.880 --> 32:49.040]  The sweetest dog and the sweetest tattoo.
[32:49.040 --> 32:50.160]  So shout out to my ninja Spence.
[32:50.160 --> 32:51.280]  Thanks again for listening.
[32:51.280 --> 32:54.560]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[33:10.560 --> 33:41.270]  So if you feel a way about the let it be positive all the time.
[33:41.750 --> 33:46.950]  If you feel a way about the remember that that's creation divine.
[33:46.950 --> 33:52.150]  If you feel a way about the let it be positive all the time.
[33:52.150 --> 33:57.590]  If you feel a way about the homegrown weed is the best weed to find out.
[33:57.590 --> 34:00.150]  Check the benefits when you're using it.
[34:00.150 --> 34:01.830]  It's so deep, deep, deep.
[34:01.830 --> 34:02.790]  Deep.
[34:02.790 --> 34:08.070]  When you're full of stress, it will help you rest during sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.
[34:08.070 --> 34:13.030]  If you got a class, all you got to ask is for strength, strength, strength, strength.
[34:13.110 --> 34:16.870]  Smoke up the sacrament with a good intent amongst your brethren.
[34:17.990 --> 34:23.510]  So if you feel a way about the let it be positive all the time.
[34:23.510 --> 34:28.710]  If you feel a way about the remember that that's creation divine.
[34:28.710 --> 34:33.910]  If you feel a way about the let it be positive all the time.
[34:33.910 --> 34:39.190]  Once you feel a way about the homegrown weed is the best weed to find out.
[34:39.190 --> 34:40.550]  The mind is powerful.
[34:40.550 --> 34:43.350]  So if you think it will come to pass.
[34:44.390 --> 34:47.190]  So when you live in life, just be extra nice.
[34:47.190 --> 34:48.550]  True love is the best.
[34:49.750 --> 34:53.750]  Sensibilia, chalice, no filia, water in my cup.
[34:55.030 --> 34:57.670]  I'm not in a rush with the burning bush.
[34:57.670 --> 34:58.630]  Light it up.
[34:59.750 --> 35:05.270]  So if you feel a way about the let it be positive all the time.
[35:05.270 --> 35:10.390]  If you feel a way about the remember that that's creation divine.
[35:10.390 --> 35:15.590]  If you feel a way about the let it be positive all the time.
[35:15.590 --> 35:21.190]  Once you feel a way about the homegrown weed is the best weed to find out.
[35:21.190 --> 35:22.390]  I'm floating high.
[35:22.390 --> 35:23.910]  Can you see my eyes?
[35:23.910 --> 35:26.150]  I'm red, red, red, red.
[35:26.150 --> 35:29.670]  Tapping the cyanide, marijuana high in my head.
[35:31.510 --> 35:34.150]  Homies, come hit my brain nerve.
[35:34.150 --> 35:35.430]  I can't be misled.
[35:36.710 --> 35:41.430]  Golden purple haze, let the fire blaze with some lambs, bread, bread, bread again.
[35:41.430 --> 35:46.950]  So if you feel a way about the let it be positive all the time.
[35:46.950 --> 35:52.150]  If you feel a way about the remember that that's creation divine.
[35:52.150 --> 35:57.350]  If you feel a way about the let it be positive all the time.
[35:57.350 --> 36:03.670]  Once you feel a way about the homegrown weed is the best weed to find out.
[36:03.670 --> 36:04.790]  The most I make.
[36:06.230 --> 36:07.830]  And man want to fight it.
[36:08.710 --> 36:10.310]  So the fire I ignite it.
[36:11.270 --> 36:12.630]  Marijuana just like.
[36:14.070 --> 36:20.870]  So why they feel that they can cast it down when it come up from the ground.
[36:23.190 --> 36:28.710]  So if you feel a way about the let it be positive all the time.
[36:28.710 --> 36:33.910]  If you feel a way about the remember that that's creation divine.
[36:33.910 --> 36:39.110]  If you feel a way about the let it be positive all the time.
[36:39.110 --> 36:44.150]  If you feel a way about the homegrown weed is the best weed to find out.
[37:00.110 --> 37:22.500]  Yeah, what's up, cannabis community?
[37:22.500 --> 37:26.020]  It's time for episode number 86 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[37:42.820 --> 37:44.180]  Thanks again for joining me.
[37:44.180 --> 37:47.460]  As always, I need to give a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band.
[37:47.460 --> 37:49.620]  That's whose music is way too loud in my headphones.
[37:49.620 --> 37:50.900]  I'm going to turn that down a little bit.
[37:50.900 --> 37:54.260]  Big shout out to Cat Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.

[38:01.620 --> 38:02.660]  Thanks for joining me.
[38:02.660 --> 38:04.260]  Oh, it's a pleasure, Jeff.
[38:06.420 --> 38:09.300]  Oh, the sarcastic tone in your voice is beautiful, my friend.
[38:09.300 --> 38:10.340]  Now thanks for joining me once again.
[38:10.420 --> 38:14.500]  Also sitting across the table from me is my tattooed and studly friend, Sloppy.
[38:14.500 --> 38:15.300]  How are you, brother?
[38:15.300 --> 38:16.260]  I'm doing well, bro.
[38:17.780 --> 38:18.900]  What's up, stoner people?
[38:18.900 --> 38:20.660]  Stoner dudes and stoner stone-ettes.
[38:21.300 --> 38:22.740]  And also the people that don't even smoke.
[38:22.740 --> 38:23.300]  You guys, what's up?

[39:32.820 --> 39:36.020]  That's enough for the technical ads and all that stuff.
[39:36.020 --> 39:38.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, the reason we have gathered here today,
[39:39.060 --> 39:40.580]  I want to talk to my buddy Sloppy.
[39:40.580 --> 39:43.300]  He was talking about wanting to be on the podcast and I was like, well, what's up, bro?
[39:43.300 --> 39:44.580]  What do you want to talk about?
[39:44.580 --> 39:48.420]  And he's like, I want to talk about my life changing transition from,
[39:49.860 --> 39:51.300]  I'm going to kind of summarize here.
[39:51.300 --> 39:54.100]  Slop's kind of a, Slop's a buff dude.
[39:54.100 --> 39:55.140]  He's got some muscles on him.
[39:55.140 --> 39:56.340]  He's tatted up.
[39:56.340 --> 39:58.980]  He looks like he could be the guy in Grand Theft Auto kind of.
[40:00.180 --> 40:02.660]  Yo, hey, that's funny.
[40:02.660 --> 40:05.780]  No, people, people, I was going to talk about that too.
[40:05.940 --> 40:09.220]  People would look at me and just assume I'm just an asshole.
[40:09.220 --> 40:11.380]  I hold the door for people and they're like, should I walk through?
[40:11.380 --> 40:12.660]  I'm like, I'm not going to slam it on you.
[40:12.660 --> 40:14.580]  You're like headband right now.
[40:14.580 --> 40:15.220]  Right?
[40:15.220 --> 40:17.780]  Yeah, well, he's grown a little bit of a fuzzy hair, dude.
[40:17.780 --> 40:19.140]  That's the longest I've ever seen his hair.
[40:19.140 --> 40:21.460]  I wasn't going to let the man get called out on that, but-
[40:21.460 --> 40:22.020]  The fro is strong.
[40:22.020 --> 40:23.060]  No, I got no issues with that.
[40:23.620 --> 40:25.700]  The fro is strong in this one.
[40:25.700 --> 40:29.300]  But Slop looks like a straight criminal and we're not going to get too deep into it,
[40:29.300 --> 40:31.140]  but Sloppy does have a history.
[40:31.140 --> 40:34.980]  And Slop has moved to Colorado and I've heard a lot about Slop.
[40:34.980 --> 40:36.420]  I know about Slop's past.
[40:36.420 --> 40:37.620]  I know where he's come from.
[40:37.620 --> 40:39.380]  And to tell you the truth, man, since I've known you,
[40:39.380 --> 40:44.580]  you've been nothing but a respectful, respectable, fucking generous, honest dude.
[40:44.580 --> 40:45.060]  And so-
[40:45.060 --> 40:45.540]  Thank you.
[40:45.540 --> 40:46.180]  Oh, for sure, man.
[40:46.180 --> 40:47.300]  Fist bump across the table here.
[40:47.300 --> 40:48.260]  Much respect.
[40:48.260 --> 40:49.780]  And if any of you guys need a dab, let me know.
[40:49.780 --> 40:52.500]  I know Joe's hanging out over here, kind of quiet, kind of listening in, hanging out.
[40:52.500 --> 40:54.180]  He'll chime in when he's got something worth saying.
[40:54.180 --> 40:55.540]  But if you guys need a dab, let me know.
[40:55.540 --> 40:56.100]  We'll get it going.
[40:56.100 --> 40:57.860]  I'll slide the dabs over here if they're in reach.
[40:57.860 --> 40:59.620]  Yeah, I'm always with dabbing.
[40:59.620 --> 41:00.340]  Right?
[41:00.340 --> 41:03.620]  So yeah, I was telling everybody how much of a criminal you are
[41:03.620 --> 41:06.980]  and how much when I finally meet you, you're fucking respectful.
[41:06.980 --> 41:07.700]  It's totally cool.
[41:07.700 --> 41:14.100]  You would never assume that I had any kind of, besides just stereotyping, like tattoos and-
[41:14.100 --> 41:15.860]  You're wearing a wife beater and some shorts.
[41:15.860 --> 41:18.100]  Yeah, I mean, hey, we can't be seen right now.
[41:18.100 --> 41:18.900]  I can't be comfortable.
[41:19.780 --> 41:24.980]  But yeah, besides stereotyping, like just from appearance, the way that I present myself,
[41:24.980 --> 41:29.540]  you wouldn't really assume that I had any past experience with organizations
[41:29.540 --> 41:31.300]  or just criminal activity at all.
[41:31.380 --> 41:38.100]  But man, the main thing I want to talk about is just really like how much has changed being
[41:38.100 --> 41:42.420]  able to smoke bud freely and grow bud and the stress reliever that comes with it.
[41:43.060 --> 41:46.180]  I mean, I started smoking weed back in fifth grade.
[41:46.180 --> 41:48.340]  I don't know the age that you are in fifth grade.
[41:48.340 --> 41:49.700]  I think you're 11?
[41:49.700 --> 41:51.060]  Yeah, you're 11 or 12.
[41:51.060 --> 41:51.780]  I wouldn't want to just-
[41:51.780 --> 41:52.740]  You were probably 14.
[41:54.660 --> 41:55.300]  What happened?
[41:55.300 --> 41:56.020]  I never failed.
[41:56.020 --> 41:57.140]  I actually always had good grades.
[41:57.140 --> 41:58.100]  You're a smart guy, dude.
[41:58.100 --> 41:59.140]  Yeah, I was just an asshole.
[41:59.620 --> 42:02.020]  I went to a minority school.
[42:02.660 --> 42:03.780]  I am not a minority.
[42:03.780 --> 42:07.540]  So I was integrated into a minority school and put in the paper and stuff.
[42:07.540 --> 42:10.340]  And it was fifth grade through 12th grade in one school.
[42:10.340 --> 42:13.460]  And I used to walk home with all the older kids.
[42:13.460 --> 42:15.700]  I won't say any names, but shout out to who you are.
[42:17.220 --> 42:20.020]  And the neighborhood was right behind the school.
[42:20.020 --> 42:23.060]  So we'd walk home and they always smoked every day.
[42:23.060 --> 42:26.260]  And then one day they were just like, do you want to smoke too?
[42:26.260 --> 42:27.380]  And I didn't even know it was bad.
[42:27.380 --> 42:28.740]  I've seen other people smoke cigarettes.
[42:28.740 --> 42:31.540]  I didn't really know the difference between what people are smoking.
[42:31.540 --> 42:34.100]  And I remember that day we smoked a blunt.
[42:34.660 --> 42:39.860]  We went and sat in their shed and played Sega Genesis for like two hours until my mom got off work.
[42:39.860 --> 42:44.660]  And they never brought up anything being wrong until right when my mom was going to get there.
[42:44.660 --> 42:49.220]  And they looked at me and said, tell her you have a headache and go to your room.
[42:49.220 --> 42:50.660]  Don't eat anything.
[42:50.660 --> 42:53.460]  And then that was the daily routine after that forever.
[42:53.460 --> 42:58.020]  But I've always had to hide smoking weed and all of that.
[42:58.900 --> 43:05.060]  I have a paraphernalia charge for a roach, literally just a roach in North Carolina.
[43:05.620 --> 43:07.140]  That's where I'm from, North Carolina.
[43:07.940 --> 43:09.060]  They're assholes.
[43:09.060 --> 43:09.860]  They don't care.
[43:11.700 --> 43:13.940]  They came to a house, they were serving a warrant.
[43:13.940 --> 43:15.860]  They smelled marijuana, came in the house.
[43:16.900 --> 43:20.100]  There was like, I was the only white person there.
[43:21.700 --> 43:25.300]  And there was like two bongs in the house and the police came up to me and they were like,
[43:25.300 --> 43:27.780]  oh, these must be yours because you're white.
[43:27.780 --> 43:29.140]  And I'm a smart ass.
[43:29.140 --> 43:31.380]  So I looked at them, I was like, actually, I smoke blunt.
[43:32.100 --> 43:34.820]  Instead of just being like, I don't smoke because I'm an asshole.
[43:35.380 --> 43:39.300]  So they walked over to the ashtray, grabbed a roach, dropped it in front of me and said,
[43:39.300 --> 43:40.020]  paraphernalia.
[43:40.020 --> 43:42.980]  And it is still to this day on my record.
[43:42.980 --> 43:44.420]  Was that a felony or a misdemeanor?
[43:44.420 --> 43:44.980]  Misdemeanor.
[43:46.820 --> 43:50.260]  I hate that there's only two levels of charges, like misdemeanor felony,
[43:50.260 --> 43:53.220]  because felonies are in there with rapists and murderers.
[43:53.220 --> 43:54.020]  That's messed up.
[43:54.820 --> 43:56.580]  In North Carolina, you can get a felony.
[43:56.580 --> 43:57.700]  I think they changed it now.
[43:57.700 --> 44:01.540]  But when I was growing up, anything over a half ounce of marijuana was a felony.
[44:01.540 --> 44:03.380]  So you'd be put in with a rapist.
[44:03.380 --> 44:05.300]  Yeah, for having some weed.
[44:05.300 --> 44:06.100]  It's ridiculous.
[44:06.820 --> 44:07.220]  But now I-
[44:07.220 --> 44:07.780]  Put a Joe in there.
[44:07.780 --> 44:08.980]  Yeah, right.
[44:08.980 --> 44:09.620]  I don't need that.
[44:11.220 --> 44:14.180]  But now I think you can have an ounce and a half, which still isn't shit.
[44:14.180 --> 44:15.700]  Like you can have a pound and a half.
[44:15.700 --> 44:16.660]  You're not going to hurt anybody.
[44:17.220 --> 44:18.340]  It's all about what you're doing.
[44:19.220 --> 44:24.580]  But marijuana really gave me an out from where I was.
[44:25.300 --> 44:32.820]  Before I was in Colorado, I was in a camper that was like 10 by 10 with no insulation.
[44:33.380 --> 44:35.540]  It had nails coming through the roof.
[44:35.540 --> 44:39.700]  And I literally ran an extension cord from the camper to somebody's well,
[44:39.700 --> 44:43.300]  because you know at the well, they have the outlets for lights and stuff.
[44:43.300 --> 44:45.700]  And I had my Mac computer in there.
[44:45.700 --> 44:49.460]  I just made music and smoked weed and did mushrooms and stuff.
[44:49.460 --> 44:51.060]  Sounds like a good life.
[44:51.060 --> 44:54.420]  It was all right, but somehow I still got women there.
[44:55.220 --> 44:56.420]  It was shitty, you know?
[44:56.420 --> 45:00.500]  And then one day, a good friend of mine, Spencer from Garden Weeding,
[45:01.140 --> 45:04.980]  big shout out to all of them, Maddie, Mike, everybody really.
[45:05.940 --> 45:08.740]  But he just called or like we were talking on Facebook at first.
[45:08.740 --> 45:12.020]  And then he called me and he was like, are you really sleeping outside?
[45:12.020 --> 45:15.460]  And I was like, yeah, I mean, it's not really outside, but yeah, kind of.
[45:15.460 --> 45:18.340]  He's like, well, would you rather just come here and grow weed?
[45:18.340 --> 45:21.460]  And it was really an impulse decision.
[45:21.460 --> 45:23.460]  Like everybody thought I was bullshitting.
[45:23.540 --> 45:25.140]  I was like in two weeks, I'm out.
[45:25.140 --> 45:26.420]  Like I'm going to Colorado.
[45:26.420 --> 45:27.460]  That's kind of how I heard it, too.
[45:27.460 --> 45:27.700]  Yeah.
[45:27.700 --> 45:29.940]  Maddie was like, you're going to meet our friend Sloppy in like two weeks.
[45:29.940 --> 45:31.380]  He's going to take the room downstairs.
[45:31.380 --> 45:32.340]  And I was like, all right.
[45:32.340 --> 45:38.100]  Yo, and I did take that room and I slept right next to that oven forever and just like chilled out.
[45:38.100 --> 45:40.740]  But yeah, no, I did.
[45:40.740 --> 45:42.340]  I just told everybody I was leaving.
[45:42.340 --> 45:43.220]  Nobody believed me.
[45:43.220 --> 45:47.300]  Two weeks came and I was gone and I don't miss it at all.
[45:47.300 --> 45:49.940]  It's been it's been amazing here.
[45:50.660 --> 45:57.940]  There's so many people with the same mind state and positive energies and just trying to help each
[45:57.940 --> 45:59.380]  other and progress in life.
[46:00.340 --> 46:01.380]  I feel like that's big.
[46:01.380 --> 46:02.740]  People don't like progressing.
[46:02.740 --> 46:05.700]  I mean, some people are stuck and want to be okay with where they are.
[46:05.700 --> 46:06.180]  Yeah.
[46:06.180 --> 46:06.820]  Incontent.
[46:06.820 --> 46:07.780]  That's such a plague.
[46:07.780 --> 46:10.660]  That's why I got this group of people here at this table, because we're all people that are all
[46:10.660 --> 46:12.980]  about moving each other and ourselves forward a little bit.
[46:13.700 --> 46:14.980]  Can't ever be comfortable.
[46:14.980 --> 46:15.540]  No, no.
[46:15.540 --> 46:17.540]  As soon as you get comfortable, that's when you start fucking up.
[46:17.540 --> 46:18.180]  Stagnation.
[46:18.660 --> 46:18.900]  Yeah.
[46:18.900 --> 46:20.420]  If you want to be ahead, you got to keep moving.
[46:20.980 --> 46:21.460]  Right?
[46:21.460 --> 46:21.700]  Yeah.
[46:21.700 --> 46:26.980]  If you're if life is super duper easy and you do the same thing every day and not much changes
[46:27.700 --> 46:29.140]  and you're unhappy about it.
[46:31.140 --> 46:32.260]  There's only one thing to do.
[46:32.260 --> 46:32.900]  That's right.
[46:32.900 --> 46:33.220]  Yep.
[46:33.220 --> 46:35.220]  Make the progression, take the next steps.
[46:35.220 --> 46:37.780]  Like if you're already stuck and frustrated, what are you going to do?
[46:37.780 --> 46:39.620]  Make yourself more stuck and frustrated.
[46:39.620 --> 46:40.660]  Like you got to think it through.
[46:40.660 --> 46:43.380]  But I mean, yeah, grab your nutsack and let's do it.
[46:43.380 --> 46:47.780]  Like our good friend Joey Diaz would say, grow some fucking balls, cocksucker.
[46:47.780 --> 46:48.260]  Yes.
[46:48.260 --> 46:48.900]  Yes, he would say.
[46:48.900 --> 46:50.100]  Don't be scared.
[46:50.100 --> 46:50.500]  Yeah.
[46:50.500 --> 46:51.060]  All right, Slop.
[46:51.060 --> 46:54.580]  So you were moving in a trailer and big shout out to Garden of Weden because you know what?
[46:54.580 --> 46:57.700]  If Spence and Manny would not have encouraged you to move out here, I would never have met you.
[46:57.700 --> 46:59.780]  So much love, much respect to that whole crew.
[46:59.780 --> 47:01.780]  There's some of my favorite people right now.
[47:01.780 --> 47:03.220]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[47:03.220 --> 47:04.500]  I wouldn't know Joe either.
[47:04.500 --> 47:04.820]  Yeah.
[47:04.820 --> 47:04.980]  Yeah.
[47:04.980 --> 47:05.380]  I met you guys in Spence.
[47:05.380 --> 47:06.660]  Garden of Weden is a beautiful bunch.
[47:06.660 --> 47:10.340]  They have only shown me extreme love in all situations.
[47:10.340 --> 47:12.500]  All the people that they've introduced to me have been totally cool.
[47:13.220 --> 47:13.620]  All right.
[47:13.620 --> 47:18.180]  So you came out here and now you live with Spence for a little while and you started
[47:18.180 --> 47:19.140]  learning how to grow.
[47:19.140 --> 47:19.780]  Yes.
[47:19.780 --> 47:27.940]  It was, I can remember so vividly the first time that Garden of Weden...
[47:28.820 --> 47:32.420]  Oh, I can remember the first time I took an official dab.
[47:32.420 --> 47:32.980]  I got off.
[47:34.180 --> 47:39.060]  I got off the plane and they got a dab ready.
[47:39.060 --> 47:42.740]  And when she pulled the rig and the torch out, Manny pulled the rig and the torch out,
[47:42.740 --> 47:45.940]  I looked at her and I was like, I don't really know what that is.
[47:45.940 --> 47:47.540]  I don't know if I want to smoke that.
[47:47.540 --> 47:48.740]  And she was like, no, it's weed.
[47:48.740 --> 47:50.100]  I was like, weed is green.
[47:51.860 --> 47:52.660]  That's not weed.
[47:53.940 --> 48:00.100]  And then I took a dab and I literally just laid my face on the window and just stared.
[48:00.100 --> 48:02.500]  So you're saying you might've been in the car when you got your first dab?
[48:03.140 --> 48:03.380]  Yes.
[48:03.380 --> 48:04.340]  So you were off the plane.
[48:05.140 --> 48:05.380]  Boom.
[48:06.500 --> 48:10.820]  Within three seconds of being in the car, she was like...
[48:11.540 --> 48:12.340]  Shout out to Maddie.
[48:12.340 --> 48:14.420]  Maddie loves us and Maddie dabs everybody out.
[48:14.420 --> 48:16.740]  If I go sit down at the house, Maddie's got, you want to dab?
[48:16.740 --> 48:17.860]  Like as soon as I walk in.
[48:17.860 --> 48:20.180]  Dab is an under S, like it's blobs.
[48:20.180 --> 48:21.220]  She globs you out.
[48:21.220 --> 48:22.820]  Here's a half gram, welcome to the house.
[48:24.260 --> 48:24.500]  Yep.
[48:25.380 --> 48:26.500]  Joe's nodding his head like...
[48:26.500 --> 48:28.180]  Yeah, I can't add anything to that.
[48:28.180 --> 48:30.020]  That is way 200% accurate.
[48:30.020 --> 48:30.260]  Yes.
[48:30.980 --> 48:32.660]  But I can, oh, oh, go ahead.
[48:34.020 --> 48:39.060]  I can totally remember the first time that they were like, the lights cut on and they were like,
[48:39.060 --> 48:40.500]  brought me into the garden.
[48:40.500 --> 48:46.980]  It was, I would like to say it was all white widow and two blue dream plants in there.
[48:46.980 --> 48:48.660]  And all you could smell was the blue dream.
[48:48.660 --> 48:49.060]  It was-
[48:49.060 --> 48:49.860]  That is correct.
[48:49.860 --> 48:50.500]  Amazing.
[48:50.500 --> 48:50.820]  Yes.
[48:50.820 --> 48:51.620]  That sounds about right.
[48:51.620 --> 48:58.020]  And I just, I remember the feeling like in my body of like overwhelming sensations that like,
[48:58.020 --> 49:02.340]  I honestly thought that I would never experience something like that without going
[49:02.340 --> 49:04.820]  to another country because it's crazy.
[49:04.820 --> 49:05.620]  It's just plants.
[49:05.620 --> 49:09.060]  But back in North Carolina, if you have that many plants, you are a,
[49:09.380 --> 49:11.140]  they think you're a fucking terrorist.
[49:11.140 --> 49:15.220]  Like they're like, come SWAT force ready, tasing and shooting.
[49:15.220 --> 49:18.660]  Like this plant is going to spread like Jumanji and kill the town.
[49:18.660 --> 49:20.020]  Like it's so ridiculous.
[49:20.020 --> 49:22.980]  But the worst thing about a raid man is the first thing they do is shoot your dog.
[49:22.980 --> 49:27.620]  Oh, and I know this sounds crazy, but if they shoot my dog in front of me,
[49:28.260 --> 49:29.460]  it's going down.
[49:29.460 --> 49:31.140]  Like I'm going to strike an officer.
[49:31.140 --> 49:32.660]  I don't want to say that, but for real.
[49:32.660 --> 49:34.420]  You know, hypothetically, you just might.
[49:34.420 --> 49:34.580]  Yeah.
[49:34.580 --> 49:34.900]  Yeah.
[49:34.900 --> 49:35.300]  For real.
[49:35.300 --> 49:36.580]  Because that's a loved family member.
[49:36.580 --> 49:37.700]  Shout out to Harvey and Bain.
[49:37.700 --> 49:38.500]  Yeah, for sure.
[49:38.660 --> 49:39.940]  And they're monsters now.
[49:39.940 --> 49:41.220]  They need their own Instagram, bro.
[49:42.020 --> 49:42.820]  They need their own Instagram.
[49:42.820 --> 49:45.220]  Slow motion, neuro-mad and stuff.
[49:45.220 --> 49:45.460]  Yeah.
[49:46.020 --> 49:46.580]  Oh man.
[49:46.580 --> 49:47.540]  These dogs are badass.
[49:47.540 --> 49:48.740]  They need their own Instagram.
[49:48.740 --> 49:49.700]  Shout out to Pitbulls.
[49:49.700 --> 49:54.340]  Yeah, they're my, yo, and I, I hate the judgment on Pitbulls.
[49:54.340 --> 49:56.100]  Like how you can't bring them to Denver and stuff.
[49:56.100 --> 49:56.580]  That's like.
[49:57.620 --> 49:57.860]  Yeah.
[49:58.580 --> 50:03.300]  One of the sweetest dogs I know is a Pitbull and she will climb up into your lap and let you pet
[50:03.300 --> 50:04.180]  her like a kitty.
[50:04.180 --> 50:04.500]  Yeah.
[50:04.500 --> 50:06.180]  And she's precious and she's a Pitbull.
[50:06.180 --> 50:07.620]  It's all about competence.
[50:07.620 --> 50:10.900]  Her boyfriend slash brother, because I'm not sure what the relationship is there.
[50:10.900 --> 50:11.940]  I've seen a little bit of both.
[50:15.060 --> 50:19.940]  But that dude is also one, he's a dumb ass, but he's one of the sweetest dogs ever.
[50:19.940 --> 50:22.900]  He's made of bricks, but he's still one of the coolest dogs.
[50:22.900 --> 50:24.740]  Dogs are the same as children.
[50:24.740 --> 50:27.780]  You can raise them to be good or you can raise dumb asses.
[50:27.780 --> 50:28.260]  Hell yeah.
[50:28.260 --> 50:28.900]  Like.
[50:28.900 --> 50:30.500]  Well, some dogs got some shit in them.
[50:30.500 --> 50:30.820]  Yeah.
[50:30.820 --> 50:31.700]  There's some dogs.
[50:31.700 --> 50:32.500]  So do some children.
[50:32.500 --> 50:33.460]  That's the truth.
[50:33.460 --> 50:34.660]  That is the truth.
[50:34.660 --> 50:37.220]  Some dogs are just born with a little demon inside, just like some kids.
[50:37.220 --> 50:37.860]  That's true.
[50:37.860 --> 50:39.700]  You got to slap this shit out of them once in a while.
[50:41.300 --> 50:43.220]  But yo, I'm down.
[50:43.220 --> 50:45.220]  Yo, just bash me with questions.
[50:45.220 --> 50:45.540]  I don't care.
[50:45.540 --> 50:46.740]  Bash you with questions?
[50:46.740 --> 50:47.860]  I'm with whatever, man.
[50:47.860 --> 50:50.660]  I was like hearing about how you moved here and then you started growing weed and you
[50:50.660 --> 50:53.380]  saw some white widow and some blue dream and it blew your fucking mind.
[50:53.380 --> 50:54.340]  Did you get to trim that?
[50:55.060 --> 51:02.500]  Oh, my first trim, I remember everybody was all like, oh, like, like not wanting to trim
[51:02.500 --> 51:04.580]  acting like it was about to be this like hard task.
[51:04.580 --> 51:06.020]  Trimming's the worst.
[51:06.020 --> 51:06.340]  Yeah.
[51:06.340 --> 51:10.340]  And then my first time I was like, this is like fucking awesome.
[51:10.340 --> 51:12.420]  You know, like this is the greatest thing ever.
[51:12.420 --> 51:16.820]  And now, you know, I've trimmed like 100 or so more plants and I'm like, fuck trimming.
[51:16.820 --> 51:20.500]  But I can totally remember the first time doing it.
[51:20.500 --> 51:25.060]  And I love if I have company from out of town coming, trying to get them into a harvest
[51:25.060 --> 51:26.660]  and just get them involved in any way.
[51:26.660 --> 51:33.140]  Because like I said, like a lot of people on on the in any legal states in general just
[51:33.140 --> 51:35.300]  think that like this is impossible.
[51:35.300 --> 51:36.020]  Like it's not.
[51:36.020 --> 51:36.740]  Oh, yeah.
[51:36.740 --> 51:37.460]  It's mind blowing.
[51:37.460 --> 51:38.020]  They're scared.
[51:38.020 --> 51:38.260]  Yeah.
[51:38.260 --> 51:38.980]  Yeah.
[51:38.980 --> 51:40.340]  This is something we can totally do.
[51:40.340 --> 51:42.340]  We can legalize cannabis nationwide.
[51:42.340 --> 51:45.380]  We can all be growing a little bit of ganja in our house and not have to go to a store,
[51:45.380 --> 51:48.500]  not have to excuse me, not have to go to the street corner.
[51:48.500 --> 51:51.780]  Not have to fucking waste money on cannabis and not have to worry or wonder.
[51:51.780 --> 51:55.140]  We were all talking about earlier how we all love that we grow the weed in the group.
[51:55.140 --> 51:55.460]  Yeah.
[51:55.460 --> 51:59.620]  Like you bring your herb and I'm not afraid to smoke Joe's herb and sloppy brings his herb
[51:59.620 --> 52:02.420]  and I'll totally smoke that and I pull out mine and they will totally smoke that.
[52:02.420 --> 52:04.900]  But if anybody else came up, there'd be a few people.
[52:04.900 --> 52:05.940]  There's some hesitance.
[52:05.940 --> 52:06.180]  Yeah.
[52:06.180 --> 52:08.420]  Like, I don't know, man, what'd you put in this shit?
[52:08.420 --> 52:09.380]  It wasn't always like that.
[52:09.380 --> 52:11.060]  I used to smoke some straight brick weed.
[52:11.060 --> 52:12.180]  That's what I started out with.
[52:12.180 --> 52:17.140]  But you know, everybody in the 90s, I was smoking that sexy Mexi brick for sure.
[52:17.140 --> 52:18.660]  500 a pound and shit.
[52:18.660 --> 52:23.220]  You know, I got to trim that shit with with Spence and Maddie.
[52:23.220 --> 52:24.340]  They taught you how to trim.
[52:24.340 --> 52:26.580]  Is that what pretty much springboarded you into growing?
[52:27.140 --> 52:36.420]  Uh, it was really, it was really just I needed something to have that I could be proud of
[52:36.420 --> 52:42.820]  and look forward to and involve myself in and keep my mind functioning and have goals
[52:42.820 --> 52:44.420]  and objectives with it.
[52:44.420 --> 52:49.940]  And, uh, you know, as somebody that smokes growing has always been a dream.
[52:49.940 --> 52:52.260]  Like, I wish I could try to do this and see what happens.
[52:52.260 --> 52:56.260]  So as soon as a dream is presented, you have to take it.
[52:56.260 --> 52:58.100]  If you don't take it, you're lame.
[52:58.100 --> 52:59.780]  Like, there you go.
[53:00.500 --> 53:02.660]  Cannabis is his anti-crime guys.
[53:02.660 --> 53:08.100]  And I remember, you know, it is, it is cannabis helps me in so many ways without cannabis.
[53:08.100 --> 53:12.900]  I don't know if I would have, uh, and failure without cannabis and failure.
[53:12.900 --> 53:15.300]  I don't think I would be the person that I am today.
[53:15.300 --> 53:17.620]  What's been your biggest failure at growing cannabis?
[53:18.180 --> 53:21.700]  Oh, um, mites.
[53:21.700 --> 53:22.180]  Oh yeah.
[53:22.180 --> 53:22.900]  Fuck a spider.
[53:22.900 --> 53:24.100]  Fucking mites, man.
[53:24.180 --> 53:28.900]  Like, uh, not thoroughly checking clones from, from people and stuff like that.
[53:28.900 --> 53:34.420]  Uh, and then not being on top of sprays and then just mites being, uh, persistent little
[53:34.420 --> 53:34.900]  fucks.
[53:34.900 --> 53:35.140]  Yeah.
[53:35.140 --> 53:35.940]  I don't, I don't like that.
[53:35.940 --> 53:36.740]  But you won't do that again.
[53:36.740 --> 53:37.140]  Will you?
[53:37.140 --> 53:39.460]  No, no, it's beautiful in there right now.
[53:39.460 --> 53:45.380]  Um, I can remember my first harvest, my first harvest honestly blew my mind.
[53:45.380 --> 53:50.980]  Uh, I had no sign that yo, I, very, very, you know, very good first grow.
[53:50.980 --> 53:51.220]  Yeah.
[53:51.220 --> 53:57.540]  I, the first time I've ever grown anything and I black cherry camp shout out to Irie.
[53:57.540 --> 53:59.380]  Uh, that shit was beautiful.
[53:59.380 --> 54:01.380]  Dark purple and sticky Yeti.
[54:01.380 --> 54:02.980]  The Yeti was so dense.
[54:02.980 --> 54:05.060]  Shout out to Jesse for his find on that Yeti.
[54:05.060 --> 54:06.340]  Yeah, for sure.
[54:06.340 --> 54:12.100]  Uh, had train wreck that just smelled so potent and then sour patch cush, which was, I mean,
[54:12.100 --> 54:13.220]  it's just good smoke.
[54:13.220 --> 54:14.420]  Is that the salt pepper ketchup?
[54:14.420 --> 54:14.740]  Yes.
[54:14.740 --> 54:16.740]  Salt, salt, pepper, ketchup.
[54:16.740 --> 54:18.260]  Uh, that's funny.
[54:18.500 --> 54:24.260]  I was with them once and, uh, we were doing clones and it said SPK on there and I was
[54:24.260 --> 54:25.940]  like, yo, is this salt pepper ketchup?
[54:25.940 --> 54:27.300]  And they just started lying.
[54:27.300 --> 54:27.620]  Yeah.
[54:27.620 --> 54:27.780]  Yeah.
[54:27.780 --> 54:29.940]  That's what the strain has been known as now in this group.
[54:29.940 --> 54:31.300]  That's so funny.
[54:31.300 --> 54:35.380]  Um, yo, it's just, it's so beautiful here.
[54:35.380 --> 54:41.540]  If you smoke and you want to be somewhere where you're accepted and you have events
[54:41.540 --> 54:46.180]  that you can go to and like, you don't have to go out of the country anymore.
[54:46.180 --> 54:51.780]  You could come here or really you could just start doing stuff to make it legal where you
[54:51.780 --> 54:52.020]  are.
[54:52.020 --> 54:53.780]  That's what I keep telling people to do.
[54:53.780 --> 54:53.940]  Yeah.
[54:53.940 --> 54:54.260]  Yeah.
[54:54.260 --> 54:57.940]  So you don't have to move, uh, stand up for your state.
[54:57.940 --> 55:01.700]  Like, I mean, it's not going to happen everywhere, but, uh, it could.
[55:01.700 --> 55:05.780]  There's already an activist group in your state making strides.
[55:05.780 --> 55:06.340]  Find them.
[55:06.340 --> 55:06.580]  Yes.
[55:06.580 --> 55:08.260]  Whatever state you are in, find them.
[55:08.260 --> 55:11.460]  Find them, find the normal, just start in the basic easiest place.
[55:11.460 --> 55:11.620]  Yeah.
[55:11.620 --> 55:13.780]  Mike gave us a nice lesson a few episodes back.
[55:13.780 --> 55:15.220]  It's titled, uh, getting involved.
[55:15.220 --> 55:18.580]  So if you guys want to learn how to get involved with some sort of cannabis movement, definitely
[55:18.580 --> 55:19.060]  check out that.
[55:19.060 --> 55:23.780]  And then also just contact your local normal NORML, the national organization for the reform
[55:23.780 --> 55:25.300]  of marijuana laws, contact them.
[55:26.020 --> 55:30.420]  They'll tell you how to get started in, uh, teaming up with locals in your area, how to
[55:30.420 --> 55:32.340]  change the rules and do stuff like that.
[55:32.340 --> 55:33.620]  So slop is here now though.
[55:33.620 --> 55:34.100]  He's here.
[55:34.100 --> 55:39.220]  So he's gotten away from his, uh, nefarious life is nefarious activities.
[55:39.220 --> 55:43.300]  Uh, he's put some people behind him, changed himself up and now, dude, I see you doing
[55:43.300 --> 55:44.020]  well, bro.
[55:44.020 --> 55:44.340]  Yeah.
[55:44.420 --> 55:47.460]  You get yourself a normal day job and you're doing shit, taking care of business.
[55:48.020 --> 55:50.740]  What else do you do when you're not at work and when you're not in the garden?
[55:50.740 --> 55:53.300]  Uh, I make music.
[55:53.300 --> 55:54.980]  That's one of the main things I do.
[55:54.980 --> 55:56.580]  I really like rapping.
[55:56.580 --> 55:58.340]  Uh, I paint, I love painting.
[55:58.340 --> 55:59.220]  Nice.
[55:59.220 --> 56:01.220]  Did you just take up painting or is that something?
[56:01.220 --> 56:02.580]  I'm fairly new at it.
[56:02.580 --> 56:03.460]  I'm not great.
[56:03.460 --> 56:04.820]  You sold one already.
[56:04.820 --> 56:05.380]  Yeah.
[56:05.380 --> 56:10.420]  Yo, I sold a, uh, fear and loss basic, uh, fear and loss Vegas, Mario painting.
[56:11.540 --> 56:11.780]  Yeah.
[56:11.780 --> 56:13.060]  That was pretty cool.
[56:13.060 --> 56:15.620]  Big ups to who bought that?
[56:15.620 --> 56:18.020]  It was like Dan dangles for 20, I think.
[56:18.020 --> 56:19.780]  I mean, uh, yeah, for sure.
[56:19.780 --> 56:20.740]  Big ups to him.
[56:20.740 --> 56:27.780]  Uh, but I just like, if I could give anybody advice, it'd be a do stuff that you enjoy
[56:27.780 --> 56:30.100]  doing and do it as much as you can.
[56:30.100 --> 56:34.020]  Uh, I mean, I try to go in the garden as much as I can making music.
[56:34.020 --> 56:36.020]  Uh, I have a regular garden.
[56:36.020 --> 56:38.420]  Like my broccolis are looking amazing right now.
[56:38.420 --> 56:40.100]  Do you have a garden in the front of your house?
[56:40.100 --> 56:41.540]  That's fucking great.
[56:41.540 --> 56:41.700]  Yeah.
[56:41.700 --> 56:42.340]  It's beautiful.
[56:42.900 --> 56:44.740]  On the way out the door the other day, it looks really nice.
[56:44.740 --> 56:46.500]  Don't you man come through and pick some stuff.
[56:46.500 --> 56:47.220]  I don't care.
[56:47.220 --> 56:51.300]  Uh, somebody said that the other day they were like, yo, what if you catch people in
[56:51.300 --> 56:53.540]  the, in the front of your house, just picking stuff.
[56:53.540 --> 56:56.340]  I was like, if they need it that bad, they can have it.
[56:56.340 --> 56:57.460]  I steal my zucchini.
[56:57.460 --> 56:57.620]  Yeah.
[56:57.620 --> 56:59.780]  You just came to my cucumbers.
[56:59.780 --> 57:00.260]  Like what?
[57:01.140 --> 57:02.900]  Have a good salad, motherfucker.
[57:02.900 --> 57:03.540]  Oh man.
[57:04.820 --> 57:08.660]  But, uh, yeah, just do what you want to do and do the most of it.
[57:08.660 --> 57:09.780]  Like for sure.
[57:09.780 --> 57:10.420]  There you go.
[57:10.420 --> 57:12.580]  And be nice to other people.
[57:13.060 --> 57:18.180]  Uh, there's a lot of conceited people in this world that just don't even notice other
[57:18.180 --> 57:19.700]  individuals in their life.
[57:19.700 --> 57:24.020]  Like, how do you go somewhere public and not acknowledge that you're going to be around
[57:24.020 --> 57:24.900]  other people?
[57:24.900 --> 57:27.140]  Just don't get it.
[57:27.940 --> 57:29.540]  I like slaps way of thinking.
[57:29.540 --> 57:30.980]  Came and dropped some random knowledge.
[57:32.580 --> 57:35.380]  I call, oh man, I call people out sometimes.
[57:35.380 --> 57:41.140]  And, uh, like the other day, this lady shout out to the lady, uh, just pushed her cart
[57:41.140 --> 57:44.740]  right in the entrance door of Walmart and just left it there.
[57:44.740 --> 57:47.540]  And I was like, yo, you could push it two feet that way.
[57:47.540 --> 57:48.740]  And she tried to keep walking.
[57:48.740 --> 57:50.740]  I was like, yo, you lazy bitch.
[57:50.740 --> 57:53.220]  Like I got mad as hell.
[57:53.220 --> 57:54.420]  And she turned around and look at me.
[57:54.420 --> 57:56.580]  I was like, and you try to say the youth is bad.
[57:56.580 --> 57:57.620]  Like put your card up.
[57:57.620 --> 58:02.180]  You just blocked everybody from walking because you had like, you're the only person at Walmart.
[58:02.180 --> 58:02.660]  Like, right.
[58:03.380 --> 58:03.860]  Nice.
[58:04.020 --> 58:06.100]  Sloppy is calling bitches out like a champ.
[58:06.100 --> 58:06.660]  I don't care.
[58:06.660 --> 58:07.860]  I'll say something like that.
[58:07.860 --> 58:08.900]  See, that's why I like cannabis.
[58:08.900 --> 58:13.460]  I can go home and smoke and forget about that fucking lazy bitch.
[58:16.820 --> 58:17.780]  Yeah, I love it.
[58:17.780 --> 58:20.820]  That sounds like something I would have ranted about on Periscope.
[58:20.820 --> 58:22.900]  Yo, shout out to Periscope.
[58:22.900 --> 58:24.420]  I knew all I had to say was Periscope.
[58:24.420 --> 58:25.060]  Yeah, for real.
[58:25.060 --> 58:29.220]  Yo, everybody jump on Periscope and make it a daily thing.
[58:29.220 --> 58:30.660]  Like, oh, I'm sloppy.
[58:31.460 --> 58:35.380]  On Periscope and all social media is the same.
[58:35.380 --> 58:39.700]  But yo, the other day I was chilling with some kids in Tokyo and they were skateboarding and
[58:39.700 --> 58:39.940]  stuff.
[58:39.940 --> 58:49.060]  It is really cool to see like real perspectives of other places and the way that they interact
[58:49.060 --> 58:50.260]  and just all kinds of stuff.
[58:51.140 --> 58:52.820]  I really enjoy Periscope.
[58:54.980 --> 58:58.500]  It's the best social networking app out at the moment.
[58:58.500 --> 59:00.340]  Do you like watching or broadcasting more?
[59:01.620 --> 59:07.940]  Uh, I would say watching just because I like other countries.
[59:07.940 --> 59:09.460]  I like seeing what's up in China.
[59:09.460 --> 59:10.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[59:10.340 --> 59:12.020]  China is one of the best feeds to watch.
[59:12.020 --> 59:14.820]  Yeah, that and Japan, Russia.
[59:14.820 --> 59:17.060]  There's some kids in Russia doing crazy shit.
[59:17.060 --> 59:18.580]  Yeah, but they're so mean to you.
[59:18.580 --> 59:20.820]  If they see that you're an American, they'll be cool.
[59:20.820 --> 59:23.940]  They'll be talking in a Russian accent, in Russian, and they'll see something that you're
[59:23.940 --> 59:26.740]  American like, oh, America, fuck you, we kill you.
[59:26.740 --> 59:29.620]  And then they just go right back to their Russian and you're like, oh, shit, I'm getting
[59:29.620 --> 59:30.100]  out of here.
[59:30.100 --> 59:31.700]  Brazil is super nice.
[59:31.700 --> 59:32.980]  Fuck Dubai as well.
[59:34.660 --> 59:38.100]  And I'm not even trying to be a dick about it, but the United Arab Emirates does not
[59:38.100 --> 59:40.340]  like white people when we go on Periscope.
[59:40.340 --> 59:40.840]  Oh, man.
[59:42.180 --> 59:45.780]  I mean, there's been wars going on for like thousands of years, but I ain't got no part
[59:45.780 --> 59:46.260]  of that shit.
[59:46.260 --> 59:46.900]  Leave me alone.
[59:46.900 --> 59:48.340]  I'm just trying to scope it up.
[59:48.340 --> 59:50.580]  I'm just trying to see what the fuck is up over there.
[59:50.580 --> 59:51.460]  You're broadcasting?
[59:51.460 --> 59:52.100]  Let me watch.
[59:52.100 --> 59:53.220]  I'm trying to see some sheiks.
[59:54.820 --> 59:56.020]  Some sheiks and some sheiks.
[59:56.020 --> 59:57.220]  There are sheiks and sheiks.
[59:57.300 --> 01:00:00.340]  So, yeah, I think everyone in the room is slightly addicted to Periscope.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.020]  There might be a slight addiction here.
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:02.740]  It's pretty great.
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:05.220]  As soon as I found out about it, I go to sleep to it.
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.980]  I'll like, tune in.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:08.340]  I try to do at least once a day.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:11.860]  I jump on and do a quick, like sometimes, you never know with me, it could turn into
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:12.580]  an hour and a half.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:12.980]  Right.
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:16.100]  If you got people watching and they're talking to me, it could be an hour and a half.
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:16.740]  Yeah.
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.580]  And I get podcast information.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:21.060]  Like people ask me questions and I'm like, oh, yeah, I'm going to write that down.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:21.940]  Listen to the podcast.
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.300]  I'll tell you that on the next show.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:23.540]  Yeah.
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:24.740]  So I get stuff like that.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:28.020]  And then I've actually done a live show with everything on Periscope.
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.940]  So hopefully I'll do that in the future.
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:30.580]  I only did it.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:33.620]  I didn't announce it because I wanted to do like a practice run.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.340]  I was like, let's just get in here and see without telling everybody.
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.260]  So next time I'll like pre-plan it.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.860]  It'll be like some night at 710.
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.140]  I'll be like, this night I'm going to do this.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:42.580]  This night?
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:43.060]  Yeah.
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.620]  I didn't say a day because I don't want anyone to think there's a real day.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:45.860]  Right.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:46.900]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:50.740]  And if you're going to join Periscope and just be a fucking creeper, just watch porn,
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.140]  man.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.580]  It's like, you're fucking weird.
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:53.940]  Yeah.
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.780]  I block a lot of people on Periscope.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.860]  I got that troll ban hammer going on.
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:58.420]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.060]  I ain't scared.
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:00.820]  Javelin.
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:03.540]  Down with the trolls.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.780]  All right, you guys, we've been going like 25 minutes.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.220]  Sloppy, what's next for you, bro?
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:07.620]  You're here.
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:08.420]  You're in Colorado.
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.460]  You got your feet on the ground.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:10.980]  You got some shit set up.
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:12.660]  You seem to be doing pretty good for yourself.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.620]  You said it yourself.
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:14.420]  Quit moving.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.180]  Or if you quit moving, you'll get stagnant.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:16.900]  So what's next?
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:23.220]  I'm really going to start trying to really step my garden up.
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:25.540]  And try to grow some amazing weed.
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:28.900]  I want to bring weed to my friends that they can look at and be like, damn.
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:29.540]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.820]  I'm also trying to move my family out here.
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.020]  I'm a big family man.
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:35.380]  Mama will be here Saturday.
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:36.500]  Your nephew is cute as shit.
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.100]  I see those Facebook and Insta pictures.
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:39.220]  Shout out to Chance.
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.260]  Yeah, what's up, little guy?
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:41.220]  He's going to be a ladies man.
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.140]  I want to get the fam out here.
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:47.060]  But honestly, honestly, if you really want to know what's next for me,
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.740]  I'm trying to get out of the country.
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:57.780]  Within the next 10 years, I want to be exploring places.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.500]  I'd like to check out other places.
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:05.220]  But I would never go somewhere that cannabis is frowned upon.
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:05.940]  Fuck all that.
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.300]  You got to go visit those places.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:07.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:08.420]  But yeah.
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.700]  Let's go to Dubai and go walk through those places where those guys on Periscope hate us.
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:12.900]  And go Periscope there.
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.180]  Go Periscope there.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.660]  Yeah, see, we get ran over by a camel in two minutes.
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.620]  They drive tanks and Humvees and shit down the street.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.260]  And Maybachs and McLarens.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:29.300]  No, for real, if I had to say, definitely what's next is just self-improvement.
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.340]  Nice.
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.940]  Trying to grow as a person.
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:32.980]  All right.
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.580]  So improve it as the self.
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.100]  Get the family out here.
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:39.860]  And then once the family's here, you're going to take off and go travel to other countries.
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:40.820]  See, I say that.
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:42.100]  I've been saying that forever.
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.140]  It may never happen.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.140]  It would have to be the same as moving to Colorado.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.660]  An impulse, do it now thing.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:51.300]  I would just like to experience other cultures more than just Periscope.
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:51.540]  Yeah.
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:52.260]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.140]  Go feel the vibe.
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:53.700]  Taste the food.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.260]  Smell the air.
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:55.220]  Put your feet in the dirt.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:55.700]  For sure.
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:56.260]  Shake hands.
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:57.300]  Get their diseases.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:57.540]  Yeah.
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.100]  Hell yeah.
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:58.820]  Sounds like a way to live.
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:02:59.940]  Work on that immune system.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:00.500]  There you go.
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.100]  Yeah, I want to travel all over the place too.
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:04.500]  Eventually, cannabis will take me all over the world.
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.260]  There's a lot of things coming over there.
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.860]  What's up, Worldwide Podcast?
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:10.180]  You know, I'll throw a fucking book bag on and do it.
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:11.780]  We can Worldwide Podcast.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:14.580]  All I need is, yeah, one book bag.
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.100]  I can do a whole podcast.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.660]  I just need the Zoom H6 and a book bag.
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:19.140]  We got this going.
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:23.700]  Furniture to make us like a little portable battery fucking book bag.
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.260]  Solar.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.620]  Yeah, solar panel.
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.700]  You need a book bag email.
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:28.580]  Book bag email.
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.180]  Wave of the future.
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:33.620]  I want one for the car, but I foresee a lot of arm burns.
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:36.980]  Yo, and the thing with the car is you could have the quick detachment,
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.500]  so it just looks like a breathalyzer.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:42.020]  So if the cop pulls you over, he's like, oh, this guy has a real jerky head.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.820]  You know, honestly, I've chilled out in the car, on the dabs in the car,
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:48.900]  the Periscope in the car, the fucking speeding in the car because I got pulled over.
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.180]  That's a good call.
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:51.060]  Once is enough.
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.460]  You know, I got off like fucking scot-free.
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:56.340]  I'm a six foot five dreadlocked Rasta man.
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:00.500]  My car smelled like skunky, cushy, danky madness,
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.380]  and that cop had no problem with it, and he let me go.
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:07.060]  So I'm just going to take one for the team and chill out in the car a little bit.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.820]  The beauty of Colorado.
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:09.060]  Yes.
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.100]  Where else does that happen?
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.620]  He smelled my breath, and when he realized there was no alcohol in my breath, he let me go.
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:17.620]  I had actually eaten a chocolate covered jalapeno just moments before he pulled me over.
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:21.140]  So when he smelled my breath, he made this wrinkled up face like, oh, God.
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:23.140]  Yeah, he knew I wasn't drinking.
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:25.940]  I think it's all about how you handle those situations.
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:31.060]  Yo, even if you don't like them, which you really have no reason not to,
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:35.060]  they got to do their job to just be their best fucking friend for 10 minutes.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.020]  Like, how hard is it?
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.220]  Hey, sir, how you doing?
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:38.660]  All of them teeth are white as hell.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:46.100]  Like, you know, I'm just saying like, I say as little as possible.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.700]  Everything ends in yes, sir, no, sir.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:51.620]  Yeah, it's pretty much like, yeah, I had the license registration proof of insurance in my
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:53.380]  hand by the time he got up to the window.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:55.780]  Like, yeah, you just got to do that kind of shit.
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:59.060]  So yeah, dude, guys, if you guys, if you got to deal with cops, just know your rights,
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:00.020]  but keep your mouth shut.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.740]  That's don't try to be assertive to the police.
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:03.780]  Just do what you got to do.
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:04.660]  Try not to get shot.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.020]  Keep your hands visible.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:06.740]  Yeah, seriously.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.980]  Keep in mind, they got a gun and they're afraid of you.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:09.780]  They don't know who you are.
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.540]  Oh, they know who I am.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:14.500]  All right.
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:17.700]  Um, shit, we've been going close to a half hour.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.500]  You guys got anything funny you want to ramble about here at the end of the show?
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.100]  We've been kind of rambling anyway, but anything you want to wrap up with Slop, since it's
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.820]  kind of, kind of the sloppy 919 show this time.
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:27.860]  Slop tart.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:30.020]  Uh, slop up a lot of dabs.
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:31.700]  Slop a lot of dabs.
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:35.140]  Well, I, once I Twittered, like, how many ways can you say sloppy?
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:40.660]  And I literally got like 70 something responses of like the slopinator and shit like that.
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:41.780]  Like the craziest.
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:45.220]  Um, nah, I just really appreciate you.
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.820]  Yo, this is, this is awesome, bro.
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:47.860]  I appreciate being here.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.580]  Uh, for sure, man.
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:49.460]  You're good as a podcast.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.340]  A great honor.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:53.460]  You know, I know, I know what's up, man.
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.060]  In the room with Irie and shit.
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.620]  Like, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.620]  I look, I look forward to more if it happens.
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:00.660]  Oh, dude, we'll do this again.
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.460]  You guys are good.
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:02.500]  Joe, how about yourself, man?
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.300]  Anything to, any words of wisdom for the end of a podcast?
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.740]  Nah, nothing too much else.
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:07.380]  All right.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:11.380]  Uh, I happen to know that Joe can throw down a hell of a beatbox.
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:12.340]  Yeah, this is going to happen.
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.820]  I'm going to try to make this happen because it wouldn't be right if I didn't try it.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.180]  So, uh, I got to read a commercial or like some closing shit.
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:23.700]  And then I'm going to try to get Joe to do a little bit of beatboxing and then maybe we can get slop.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:24.820]  And I never gave slop credit.
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:26.980]  You guys remember that in the garden of weed and getting weeded song?
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:27.700]  Oh yeah.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:28.820]  That was my homie sloppy.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.740]  We played that on the podcast a couple of times.
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:31.540]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:32.100]  Thanks for coming.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:32.980]  And thanks for doing that.
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:33.540]  No problem.
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:36.980]  Before I start reading this and before I ask you guys to beatbox, huge thanks to both you guys
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.540]  coming and taking an hour out of your day and being on my podcast.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.500]  You guys are welcome back.
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.380]  Yeah, this was awesome.
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:42.020]  Yeah. Thank you.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:43.540]  People will have questions for both of you.
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:44.420]  So we'll get answers.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.340]  Start your own garden.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:47.300]  Yes.
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:48.020]  That's all I have to say.
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.140]  No, I finally thought of it.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:52.900]  That's going to be the theme of Joe's rap and slop is going to freestyle over here in a minute.
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.860]  If I can get that shit to happen whenever you guys are ready.
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.540]  All right, you guys, thanks for listening to another episode.
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:58.100]  I'll be back.
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:59.460]  I'm not sure when I'm going to post another episode.
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:00.660]  It'll probably be Monday morning.

[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:15.140]  I'm seriously trying to work up to a Zoom H6 so that we can take the podcast a few more places.
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:19.540]  I would love to get that here before the next couple of months.

[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:27.140]  If you got $5, if you got $10, that would work.
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:30.660]  If you want to add some zeros onto the end of that, I am not going to complain.
[01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.020]  It would be much appreciated.
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:34.500]  I feel like I'm begging now, so I'm going to move on with this part.
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.740]  Thanks to my guests once again for coming out.
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:38.980]  Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:40.180]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:43.460]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:46.980]  One, one, one.
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.240]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:16.680]  It's time for episode number 87 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.880]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:20.680]  That's right.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.440]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a hardcore
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:28.200]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:31.720]  current state of cannabis, this, my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:32.920]  I'm your host.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.120]  They call me Ross to Jeff.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.200]  Thanks again for joining me as always.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.320]  I want to send a huge thank you.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:40.360]  Shout out to the mystic roots band for letting me use their music on the show.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:43.640]  Big thanks to Kat and the entire mystic roots crew.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.760]  All right, you guys, before we get too far, let's get this ad out of the way.

[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.720]  that you do need.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:49.160]  All right, guys, I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Fred Garvin.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.200]  I'm going to turn this music down just a little more, but I want to give a huge shout
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.560]  out to Fred Garvin.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:58.120]  I posted something to Facebook and Fred politely commented saying, Hey, Jeff, you've been doing
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.240]  a great job, but you've kind of strayed away from the grow lessons.
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.360]  And he asked for more grow lessons.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.960]  Fred, I can't agree with you more.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.680]  I have strayed away from the grow lessons that I've tried to provide you.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.520]  There's been so much great news.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.400]  I don't know that all of the news has been great, but there's been so much important
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:17.880]  news that I felt like it's been my job to bring that news to the cannabis world.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:18.520]  So you're right.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.600]  I have gotten a little bit away from the grow lessons and I got a lot into the news, but
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:23.000]  you know what?
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.520]  We're going to get back into grow lessons.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:28.120]  I've got part of this will be a little bit about grow lessons.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.960]  And then the next episode is going to be about pH, which is all about growing.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.560]  So Fred, you're totally correct.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:34.280]  And I will fix that.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.960]  We'll get back to the grow lessons, my friend.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.960]  But before we get that far, I know I just said we're going to get back into grow lessons
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:43.080]  and get away from the news, but I've already had this episode planned.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:47.400]  So you're going to have to bear with me because there's a very important news article that
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.040]  I want to read to you.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:50.680]  I'm thumbing through my computer here trying to find it now to tell you the truth.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:51.320]  There we go.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:51.800]  All right.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.600]  We're going to get right to it.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.200]  This news article comes from The Cannabis.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:59.320]  I found this very important since I have recently taken over as the lead grower at the spot
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.000]  dispensary in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.920]  Now that I am running a large facility, things like this really stand out to me.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.440]  So let's get right to the article, you guys.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:10.120]  This is from The Cannabis and it was written by Kristen Wyatt of the Associated Press.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.920]  The headline is, unknowns abound in pesticide use for growing pot.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:19.560]  Then the sub headline says, there is no federal agency that will recognize this as a legitimate
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.040]  crop.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:25.160]  Pest management information regarding this crop devolves to internet chats and hearsay,
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:30.760]  says Whitney Cranshaw, a Colorado State University entomologist and pesticide expert.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:35.000]  So obviously this is going to be about pesticides and bugs and cannabis plants.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.680]  So the article goes like this, microscopic bugs and mildew can destroy a marijuana operation
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.440]  faster than any police raid.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.440]  And because the crop has been illegal for so long, neither growers nor scientists have
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:49.400]  any reliable research to help fight the infestations.
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:54.840]  If you guys have ever grown any cannabis, you'll know that the number one obstacle can
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.720]  be bugs for you.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.760]  Once bugs show up, it is hard as hell to get rid of bugs in a grow room if you're not experienced
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.280]  and if you don't know what you're doing.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.080]  So we'll keep going.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:07.560]  It says, as legal marijuana moves from basements and backwoods to warehouses and commercial
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.720]  fields, the mold and spider mites that once ruined only a few plants at a time can now
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.080]  quickly create a multimillion dollar crisis for growers.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.080]  Some are turning to industrial strength chemicals, raising concerns about safety.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.280]  They say multimillion dollar crisis for growers.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.480]  They are not kidding you guys.
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:30.840]  The facility that I am working in, that I am helping them finish build, we have four
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:36.840]  flowering rooms and one of those rooms has 26 Govita light hanging in there.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:41.240]  Um, our projections are almost anybody's goal.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.520]  If you're growing with a Govita, your goal is two pounds per light.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.120]  So that's 52 projected pounds of cannabis coming out of that room.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:52.280]  Uh, I can't really tell you what the going rate is for a pound of cannabis in Colorado
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:56.680]  right now at a retail center or being sold from retail to retail center.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.000]  But that is quite an investment.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.880]  If I were to fuck up 52 pounds of weed, that would really cost us quite a bit of money.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.280]  We would not make the money we planned on making.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.240]  It would, that's, that's a bummer in the first place.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.600]  Then you can't pay the bills.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.800]  Then you're short money.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.320]  Then you don't have product on the shelf.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.480]  It would cause a lot of problems.
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:19.720]  Obviously you can see how one 52 pound harvest could really cause a lot of problems.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:23.720]  And then you've got all the wasted time and the wasted plants because the plants cost
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:27.880]  money, all the wasted nutrients, all the wasted electricity.
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:29.960]  It can really add up quickly.
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:33.480]  So I'm going to continue the article here.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.120]  Where was I?
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.360]  It says herbicides and insecticides are regulated by the federal government, which still regards
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.760]  almost all marijuana as an illicit crop.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:45.640]  So there's no roadmap to help pot farmers, chemists and horticulturalists can't offer
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:46.920]  much assistance either.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.160]  They sometimes disagree about how to combat the problem largely because the plant is used
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:55.320]  in many different ways, smoked, eaten, and sometimes rubbed into the skin.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:00.440]  We have an industry that's been illegal for so many years that there's no research.
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.400]  There's no guidelines.
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:06.280]  There's nothing said Frank Conrad, lab director of Colorado Green Lab, a pot testing lab in
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.760]  Denver and states that regulate marijuana.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:12.920]  Officials are just starting to draft rules governing safe levels of chemicals.
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:18.120]  So far, there have been no reports on any human illness trace to chemicals used on marijuana,
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.960]  but worries do persist.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:24.520]  The city of Denver this spring quarantined tens of thousands of marijuana plants at 11
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.800]  growing facilities after health inspectors suspected use of unauthorized pesticides.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:34.360]  Some of the plants were later released after tests revealed the pot was safe, but two producers
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.600]  voluntarily destroyed their plants.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:44.760]  Actually, there was about 600 pounds of cannabis voluntarily destroyed because of illegal pesticides.
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:49.640]  The article says eight businesses still have at least some plants in quarantine.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.920]  The article goes on to say, in Oregon, a June investigation by the Oregonian newspaper found
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:00.280]  pesticides in excess of legal limits on produce on products ranging from marijuana buds to
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.280]  concentrated marijuana oils.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:06.600]  Other pesticides detected on the marijuana are not regulated by Oregon's marijuana rules,
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.600]  meaning that products containing those chemicals still can be sold there.
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:15.720]  The US Environmental Protection Agency, which decides which pesticides can be used on which
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:20.920]  crops, just said last month that Colorado and Washington authorities that they could apply to
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:25.640]  have some cannabis related chemicals approved through what's called a special local need
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:28.920]  registration, but that process could take years.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:32.440]  So it looks like we're on our way, but it could take years, it says here.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.120]  It goes on to say, Colorado and Oregon require retail marijuana to undergo testing for pesticides
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.400]  and other contaminants.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:44.520]  But as the Oregon investigation showed, the testing regimes are imperfect, and Colorado
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:49.080]  hasn't yet implemented requirements for retail pot to undergo pesticide testing because of
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.520]  regulatory delays.
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:53.560]  There aren't any labs here that'll test for it yet, you guys, that's part of the problem.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:57.000]  Washington state is still working on its pesticide rules.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.040]  The nation's largest marijuana producer, California, has no regulations at all for growing
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:02.840]  commercial pot.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:13.160]  And up until this industry got hugely popular on a recreational and legal level, the guidelines
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:19.080]  and the people who were responsible for quality control were the growers.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:20.840]  We were the ones responsible for that.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.600]  It was a craft, it was an art, it was something that we were proud of.
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:29.320]  We would not let out a product that had been sprayed with some bullshit or a product that
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.680]  had powdery mildew on it.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:36.200]  We were the ones who were responsible for that and took that responsibility.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:40.600]  And now that it's so commercially popular and everybody's buying and growing and selling
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.720]  cannabis, the art and the love, ooh, I hope you guys heard that.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:45.080]  That was some amazing thunder.
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.680]  It's finally raining, we've needed it.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.800]  But it was my responsibility.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:52.120]  Now that it's so popular, everyone's worried about the money.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.280]  They've gotten away from the art and the pride, and they're just doing whatever they can do
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:01.160]  to get plants on the ground, pounds out the door, and money in the cash register, and
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.680]  customers out the door.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.600]  And that's not really what it's about.
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:08.680]  So since people have lost the heart, they're not growing from their heart like I try to
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:09.720]  teach them to do.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:13.160]  We have to come up with some sort of testing and we have to create rules and this is where
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:13.800]  we are.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:19.160]  So it says, it's a lot more difficult than it sounds and it's expensive, Washington liquor
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:22.520]  control board spokesman Brian Smith said about testing for pesticides.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:28.120]  As a result, unscrupulous pot growers can use banned chemicals with little chance of
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:28.760]  being caught.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:37.000]  We were taken by surprise, this whole pesticide issue, said Ashley Kilroy, Denver's director
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.280]  of marijuana policy.
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.720]  She was talking to a room of about 200 pot industry workers who had invited...
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.800]  Yeah, it's missing a word here.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:52.440]  Invited lunch after the invited to a lunch maybe, earlier this month to learn about pesticide
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.400]  quarantines and rules.
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.720]  Sorry, they skipped a word of this article and it totally threw me off.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.880]  It just says invited lunch.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.200]  So that's weird.
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:00.920]  We'll keep going.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.760]  What the growers heard wasn't encouraging.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:07.640]  There's no federal agency that will recognize this as a legitimate crop, said Whitney Crenshaw,
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:11.000]  a Colorado State University entomologist and pesticide expert.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.160]  Regulators just bury their heads.
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:18.520]  And as a result, pest management information regarding this crop devolves to internet chats
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.480]  and hearsay.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:24.280]  And you guys don't want to go start reading about how to battle bugs or powdery mildew
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:27.480]  on a large scale on the internet, because there's so much bullshit that you'll have
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.920]  to feed through that if you don't have a good base knowledge, it'll just confuse you and
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.360]  mess you up even more.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:36.280]  So marijuana growers are indeed guessing when they treat their plants.
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:40.760]  For example, one of the chemicals cited in Denver quarantines, a fungicide called Eagle
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:46.440]  20 is commonly used on grapes and hops, but can become dangerous when heated and is banned
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.040]  for use on tobacco.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:52.360]  No research exists on whether the fungicide is safe for use on pot that will be eaten.
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:59.720]  Now, something I've read recently about exactly Eagle 20 is Eagle 20 gets inside of a...
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.480]  Okay, it goes in the plant is what it does.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:05.640]  And it stops the plant from producing powdery mildew.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:08.760]  And it can last for 60 to 90 days in the plant.
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:13.240]  So that's a little crazy if you understand the plant biology there.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:18.040]  But also what I've read is if it gets on your skin, it absorbs into your skin and it changes
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:18.920]  your RNA.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:23.560]  And you won't notice it because you might not live long enough to even notice the changes
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.080]  that occurred in your body.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.720]  But your grandchildren will be affected by this.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:31.320]  Your grandchildren will have birth defects, attention deficit disorders.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.480]  I can't guarantee they will, but that is what this type of chemical does.
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:40.040]  It doesn't fuck you up, but it messes you up in the insides to where your kids' kids
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:41.080]  are messed up, which is...
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:44.840]  That's got to be some serious, dangerous shit that I don't want to mess with.
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.600]  I don't want sprayed on my plants.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.120]  I don't want sprayed on your plants.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:49.000]  We'll keep going here.
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:54.280]  Several pot growers interviewed by the Associated Press agreed that research is needed on pesticides
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:54.680]  for pot.
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:58.920]  But they pointed out that pesticides are widely used on food crops and that weed consumers
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.120]  have never before had as much information about the marijuana they buy.
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.320]  It's just like broccoli or spinach or peaches or anything.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:09.640]  The plant is susceptible to certain pests, said Gabriel Fairforth.
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:10.840]  I think I said that right.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:11.400]  Fairorth?
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.360]  Fairorth?
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:15.320]  Anyway, who is cultivation manager of Denver's Herbal Remedies.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.840]  I apologize for butchering your name there.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:21.480]  Fairorth does not use any banned chemicals on his plants and was not affected by the
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:24.520]  quarantines, but he questioned some of the banned chemicals.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:27.960]  If you have all these chemicals that are safe on products you eat, but you can't use them
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.880]  on marijuana, I don't know that I agree with that.
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:34.120]  The founder of the nation's oldest marijuana legalization advocacy group,
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:40.280]  Keith Stroup of the NORML organization, National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws,
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:44.760]  pointed out that regulators today are at least starting to look at marijuana safely.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:48.840]  In the 1980s, the federal government used an herbicide called Paraquat to kill illicit
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:53.080]  marijuana crops, even though the poison had been banned from national forests because
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.000]  of environmental concerns.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.840]  NORML complained to the White House that some of the weeds survived and was turning up on
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:21:59.320]  the street.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:04.760]  The response was, it's illegal and we don't have any obligation not to poison it, Stroup
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:05.560]  recalled.
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.080]  No one was taking us seriously.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:10.840]  That is kind of sick that they poisoned this weed, the weed made it to the street, and
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.560]  when they said, hey, this weed's out there, they went, not our problem, bro.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.120]  It's illegal.
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:14.840]  Don't fuck with it.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.560]  It's tough love from the government right there.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:22.280]  Recent actions by states with legal weed have been encouraging, if slow, he said.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:26.600]  The idea that it's been on the black market and people are fine, so therefore we don't
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.760]  need testing is absurd, Stroup said.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:35.320]  No one would want to be using a product that has molds or pesticides, and that is very
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:35.560]  true.
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.840]  Nobody wants to smoke a product that has mold or pesticides in it.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:39.480]  That's just gross.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.400]  Why do you even want to put that into your body?
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.840]  Why do you want to put that in your pipe?
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.720]  Why do you, as a grower, why would you want to put that out there?
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.000]  Why would you act like you're proud?
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.680]  Why would you even sell that to somebody?
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.840]  That's just weirdness to me.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:55.640]  So that article came from, I'm scrolling back up to remember her name, it is Kristen Wyatt
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:57.160]  from the Associated Press.
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:01.400]  Now, sorry, I got to clear my throat here.
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:02.280]  Let me take a quick drink.
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:11.100]  Sorry, I needed a drink.
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:11.500]  All right.
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:15.820]  So as a grower, I find it kind of wrong that people would even spray some of this shit
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:16.460]  on their plants.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:19.020]  I don't use anything that is not completely organic.
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:21.020]  And honestly, I avoid using sprays.
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:26.780]  But since I work at Agro and I go to a lot of grows, I know that I'm putting myself at
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:29.260]  risk, so I need some sort of safety net.
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:30.540]  So I do use products.
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:35.740]  I try not to use too much neem oil because neem oil will definitely affect the flavor
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:36.860]  of my extracts.
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:39.820]  So there are certain things that I'll use, certain things that I won't use.
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:43.580]  And we've definitely been talking about what we will and won't use at the shop because
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:48.540]  there are things that we definitely do not want to put in our crop at the shop.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:52.300]  So I think if you guys are going to grow weed or cannabis or pot or whatever you want to
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:55.020]  call it, think about who's going to consume the products that you're growing.
[01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:59.020]  Our goal is to make people feel better and not give them cancer or lung disease.
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:23:59.580]  All right.
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:02.940]  So don't spray some shit on your plants that's going to give somebody cancer or lung disease.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:07.100]  Don't spray anything on your plants that you wouldn't spray on your produce and then eat
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:07.500]  it.
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.900]  I think that should be our new guideline.
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:14.700]  And also, you guys, think about what would happen if we gave some contaminated products
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:17.020]  to a person with a compromised immune system.
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:22.540]  I'm a caregiver and one of my favorite patients, I'm a medical marijuana caregiver, which means
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:28.620]  I am responsible for growing a few people's medical cannabis.
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:31.980]  And I've got a patient, his name is Doug, and Doug's an older dude.
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.900]  He's over 50 years old and he's not in good health.
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:40.060]  Since I've known him, he's had three or four major health problems in just the few years
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:40.780]  that I've known him.
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:45.100]  I grow medical cannabis for Doug to make Doug feel better.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:48.780]  I grow medical cannabis for Doug to help Doug live longer.
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:51.100]  I'm trying to improve Doug's life.
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:55.020]  When I'm mixing up nutrients and reading the back of a nutrient bottle, I'm kind of thinking
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:56.140]  about Doug's lungs.
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:57.420]  I'm thinking about Doug's heart.
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:58.780]  I'm thinking about Doug's kidneys.
[01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:00.300]  I'm thinking about Doug's high.
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.300]  I'm thinking about Doug because I don't want to kill Doug.
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:04.220]  I want to make Doug feel better.
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:07.180]  So if I see powdery mildew in a crop, I cut the crop down.
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:07.900]  I clean the room.
[01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:10.620]  I start over and figure out why I got powdery mildew.
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:15.900]  If I have to spray some shit on there, I think about Doug before I apply anything.
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:17.420]  I read, I research.
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:18.780]  I try to be good to myself.
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:19.980]  I try to be good to Doug.
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:23.740]  I try to be good to anybody else that's going to smoke this stuff or eat this stuff or make
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:28.220]  cash out of this stuff because it's going into a sick person's body and we don't want
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:29.100]  to kill them.
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:31.340]  We want to make them feel better.
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:32.940]  All right.
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:34.620]  So a lot of people, I wrote this down.
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:37.580]  A lot of people are going to have the excuse that they didn't know they were using some
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:38.700]  dangerous pesticides.
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:43.020]  Like I said earlier, as a grower, that is your responsibility.
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:45.340]  You're supposed to read every bottle.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:49.100]  Everything that you, when you go to the grocery store, you should have already read about
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.340]  that product before you bought it today.
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:53.340]  Read every bottle and then go.
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:57.100]  If you don't know what that one ingredient is, if you don't know what spinosad is, if
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:00.300]  you heard me recommend spinosad to get rid of whiteflies on the show.
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:04.060]  If you don't know what spinosad is before you spray it, go read what that shit is and
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:05.660]  understand what you're spraying on your plants.
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.660]  That's your responsibility as a grower.
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:09.020]  You should have read every bottle.
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:12.700]  You should have researched everything so that you know what you're putting into yourself
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:15.900]  and so that you know what you are giving to sick people.
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:19.820]  And this counts even if it's a commercial or a recreational grow because you don't know
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:21.500]  where that product is going to end up.
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:24.220]  You have no idea who's going to be smoking it.
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:26.700]  You don't want to make more people more sick.
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:28.380]  All right, let's work on healing people.
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:30.380]  You guys be more responsible with your grows.
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:30.620]  Please.
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.580]  That's my point.
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.900]  Big shout out to Kristen Wyatt from the Associated Press.
[01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:38.940]  Also, much respect to the cannabis for always keeping the good news coming my direction.
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:40.540]  You guys, it is 710.
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:43.260]  There's some killer thunder rolling through my neighborhood right now.
[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:44.300]  It sounds great.
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:45.580]  It has finally cooled off.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:48.140]  It's been stupid hot here the past few days.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:48.940]  It's 710.
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:50.540]  I'm putting myself together a fat dab.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:52.300]  I hope you guys are getting a dab together.
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:54.300]  On the count of five, let's do a dab here together.
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:55.900]  You guys, one, two, three.
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:06.860]  Yeah, that's what I needed.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.500]  Sorry about the silence while I'm dabbing.
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.820]  Hope you guys are dabbing with me so it wasn't super silent.
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:17.660]  All right, so I got an email recently.
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:19.020]  No, this was a Facebook message.
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:19.660]  No, it was an email.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:20.220]  I don't remember.
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:26.460]  I got a message from somebody who follows me on Facebook and also supports my Periscope
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:29.180]  because I saw you on Periscope and you reminded me about this question.
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:29.900]  I appreciate it.
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:33.260]  You guys, if you're not on the Periscope app, if you're not checking out Periscope,
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:34.220]  you should definitely do that.
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:36.220]  You can get it on Apple devices.
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:38.380]  You can get it on Android devices.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:39.820]  The Periscope app is fun.
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:40.540]  You download it.
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.380]  Go follow me when I come on live.
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:45.260]  It'll whistle at you.
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:48.860]  You can open up the screen and you can watch me rant or ramble or take dabs
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:51.500]  or walk through a grill room or whatever I happen to be doing that day.
[01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:56.620]  But the Periscope is a live broadcast and then the video stays up for 24 hours
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:59.740]  unless I said something stupid and then I go delete the whole video.
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:01.740]  But most of the time I leave it up.
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.180]  So you guys check it out on Periscope.
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:05.020]  I'm coughing from that dab.
[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:07.580]  I'm going to take a drink and then I'm going to get on to the point to this next topic here.
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:13.900]  All right, big shout out to root beer.
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:15.820]  All right, this next topic is carbon filters.
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:19.340]  Like I was saying, my friend sent me an email asking about carbon filters.
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:25.100]  Let me start off by saying that the information that you sent me,
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:27.340]  you had an idea of which carbon filter you wanted.
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:29.900]  You have chosen the right filter.
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:32.300]  That's what I think from the info that you gave me.
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:34.860]  You were talking about getting the 39 inch tall
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:38.380]  with either an eight or a six inch duct on it.
[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:39.980]  I think that would work perfectly.
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:40.480]  All right.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:43.420]  Ooh, that thunder is so sexy.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.300]  I want to turn off the compression so that you guys can hear the thunder in the background,
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.900]  but I can't get it on there.
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:49.900]  It's not loud enough.
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:53.260]  So let's talk about a little bit about selecting the carbon filter, you guys.
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:56.940]  First of all, I should explain to you what a carbon filter is.
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:57.740]  Maybe you're new.
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:59.580]  Maybe you're not familiar.
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:04.780]  A carbon filter is what we use to take the air, to take the smell out of the air.
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:08.140]  If the air is leaving your grow room, it's going to stink like crazy.
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:12.460]  If you have flowering plants and you have a blower or an inline fan
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:14.220]  blowing air out of your grow room,
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.540]  you have to get that humidity out of there.
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:18.380]  You got to get that old air out of there.
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:19.980]  You got to get some fresh air in there.
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:23.980]  When you're blowing that old air out, it is going to smell like cannabis.
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:27.100]  It is going to stink like a skunk or fruit or berries.
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:28.700]  It's going to stink if you're doing it right.
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:31.900]  So the carbon filter goes on your inline fan
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:35.260]  and then it goes out of your facility.
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:38.140]  It blows the air out of the facility and all the air that passes through
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.900]  the carbon filter will be cleaned.
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:45.180]  The carbon filter is a cylinder with activated charcoal in it
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:46.700]  and it connects to your inline fan.
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:49.020]  And then it blows air through.
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:53.820]  It goes the carbon filter first and then you can do inline fan or ducting,
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:56.060]  however you choose, but then you go out of your grow area
[01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:58.860]  and the air that goes through the carbon filter
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:03.420]  has all of the contaminants removed and those contaminants include the odor.
[01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:08.620]  So that's basically the stone version of what a carbon filter is.
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:12.620]  Cylinder with activated charcoal that connects to your inline fan.
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:16.460]  And as the air goes through it, it removes the contaminated air and odors.
[01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:20.780]  So now we'll talk a little bit about how to select your carbon filter
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:22.780]  because this is the part that our friend needed help with.
[01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:27.500]  The goal of your carbon filter and your blower in your room is to exchange
[01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:32.220]  the air in your grow room every one to three minutes for best odor control.
[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:35.900]  Because what that means is you want to take all of the air out of your room
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:38.300]  and you don't want to empty it and then refill it.
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:41.020]  Of course, you want to be sucking air out of the room
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:43.740]  and refilling every one to three minutes.
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:44.380]  All right.
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:48.460]  So you want to get the air completely exchanged every two to three minutes
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:51.820]  or 20 to 30 times an hour-ish for best odor control.
[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:57.660]  So to do that, you need to find the cubic volume of the room.
[01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:01.260]  And to do that, you measure length times width times height.
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:01.660]  All right.
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:05.020]  And that will equal the cubic volume of the room.
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:07.020]  Once you know the cubic volume of your room,
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:11.900]  then you need to get an inline fan that will pull that volume of air
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:15.900]  20 to 30 times per hour through your room.
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:18.140]  And then you'll find a carbon filter that matches that.
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:20.540]  And that's easy because the...
[01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:21.100]  All right.
[01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:24.220]  What you need to do, you'll find the cubic volume of the room, right?
[01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:25.260]  I'm going to make up a room.
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:28.220]  This room is 12 by 12.
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:31.740]  That's got a 12 by 12 footprint with an eight foot ceiling, right?
[01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:32.860]  So that I did the math.
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:38.060]  That comes out to 1,152 cubic feet.
[01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:40.060]  But that's the cubic volume of the room.
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:43.820]  So you want a blower.
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:45.500]  Ideally, it would pull...
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:51.340]  It would have a CFM rating of 1,152 or close to that.
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:57.660]  If you go look at the Vortex fan, they actually sell one that is an 1140 CFM.
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:32:01.420]  So I would use that on either a six or an eight inch duct.
[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:02.940]  That's what I would recommend.
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:08.300]  And then you would want to find a carbon filter that is rated for the same amount of CFMs.
[01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:09.500]  They come in ranges.
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:18.460]  So you're going to need a carbon filter that is able to scrub about 1,152 cubic feet of volume
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:20.940]  in your room would be ideal.
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:25.020]  You can go half of that, which is about 576.
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.660]  But you don't want to go much lower than that.
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:32.860]  If you went to a third of that, you're looking in the 380s and you're not going to be pulling
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:34.780]  enough humidity out that way.
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:39.580]  You may get the smell out that way, but you're not going to be cooling the room and you're
[01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:41.580]  definitely not going to remove enough humidity and shit.
[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:47.500]  So I would recommend going 575 to like 1,152, maybe 1,200 at the max.
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:51.660]  But that's how you need to select your blower.
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:55.020]  A blower that is going to pull the appropriate amount of air.
[01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:57.260]  And then the carbon filter will follow the blower.
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:00.540]  Make sure you get the right size flange on there.
[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:05.660]  They come in anywhere from a four all the way up to I think a 16 is as big as I've seen them.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:06.780]  I may have seen an 18.
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:08.300]  I'm not sure if I've ever seen that one.
[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:09.900]  I've seen that big of one in use.
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:18.060]  So once you find your carbon filter that matches your blower, I would recommend that you hang
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:20.700]  the carbon filter as high as you can in the room.
[01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:24.540]  Hang it up as high as you can because heat rises.
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:28.620]  You want to keep your air conditioner down low and you want to keep your heat that's
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:28.940]  up top.
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:30.140]  You want to suck that out.
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:32.860]  Make sure you guys change out the carbon filter.
[01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:35.900]  Remember, they don't last more than a year, maybe two.
[01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.260]  Some of them are rechargeable.
[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:43.580]  But from what I have found, it's actually much cheaper to just go buy a new one.
[01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:48.300]  The hard part is finding an economical or not economical and environmentally friendly
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:50.700]  way to get rid of your old carbon filter.
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:53.420]  If you guys have any suggestions on that, you can send me an email.
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:55.260]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:59.820]  I would love to share that information on the show, get somebody to dispose of their
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:01.340]  carbon filter more properly.
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:04.140]  I've got a couple lined up in my garage that I don't know what to do with.
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:07.020]  All right, you guys, I hope that made sense.
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:09.980]  That was my very quick lesson on how to select a carbon filter.
[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:11.820]  Hang it high.
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:15.020]  You guys, if you're going to hang a big carbon filter from the roof, from the ceiling, I
[01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:18.220]  mean, make sure you do it smartly, wisely.
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:20.220]  God, my grammar is terrible today.
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:24.700]  Make sure you use a stud and not like a guy like myself or Jesse.
[01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:27.580]  Make sure you find a beam in the room.
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:28.540]  Just do everything smart.
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:29.420]  Don't destroy the house.
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:33.260]  Don't hurt yourself, especially hanging a 40-pound, 50-pound carbon filter above your
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:33.820]  head.
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:34.780]  That shit could fall.
[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:35.740]  I don't want it to break you.
[01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:36.860]  I don't want it to break your plants.
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:37.500]  I love you guys.
[01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:39.900]  I would miss you if you quit listening.
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:41.660]  I'd definitely hate it if you hurt yourself.
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:42.620]  So be careful.
[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:43.580]  Safety first.
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:46.860]  And since I'm talking about that, here's a piece of advice that I don't talk about often
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:47.100]  enough.
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:51.580]  Somebody was like, hey, bro, if you could put like one or two essential pieces of gear
[01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:53.980]  in a grow room that I may have overlooked, what would they be?
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:55.020]  You know what I told him?
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:59.500]  I said a fire extinguisher on the outside of the room, right outside the door and a
[01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:01.580]  smoke alarm inside of the room.
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.020]  I don't share that information enough.
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:04.860]  That's something I definitely recommend.
[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:08.940]  Put a smoke alarm in there and then put your fire extinguisher outside of the grow room
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:12.540]  if it's a residential grow, because you don't want to have to run in the grow room to find
[01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.860]  the fire extinguisher in a worst case scenario.
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:18.860]  You want it right outside so you can kick open the door and just start spraying if that's
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:20.140]  what needs to be done.
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:24.460]  I hope that never has to happen for you guys, but I hope you do have a fire extinguisher
[01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:25.580]  in the case that you do need it.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:28.300]  And I hope you had a smoke alarm to give you some heads up.
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:31.100]  Don't be that guy that burned down your grow.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.500]  All right, you guys, I feel like I've been going for about 30 minutes here.
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:36.940]  Let's go click over to the Garage Man and see how long we've been going.
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:39.340]  Just about almost 27 minutes.
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:43.900]  I feel like if I start doing the closing now, we should wrap up right on time for a 30 minute
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:44.700]  episode.
[01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:46.140]  You guys, I really appreciate it.
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:51.260]  You've been listening to these 30 minute episodes a whole lot more than you did those 45 an
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.460]  hour long shows.
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:56.700]  I feel like a lot of you pot smokers have ADD or maybe you just have a short lunch break
[01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:57.180]  or something.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.420]  But I appreciate you guys listening.
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:02.700]  I can see that you listened to the whole episode and I can see who cuts.
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:06.220]  I can't see who, but I can see that a lot of the listeners cut out at certain times.
[01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:08.940]  So I've learned that about 36 minutes is your attention span.
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:12.380]  So I try to keep them about 36 minutes, 40 at the most.
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:14.140]  But I appreciate everybody for listening.
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:15.660]  You guys, I'm going to start closing up the show.
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:17.020]  Make sure you check out our sponsors.
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:20.140]  You guys don't forget about Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:21.660]  Definitely love those guys.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:24.860]  If you remind them that you listen to the Grow From Your Heart podcast, they will give
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:27.580]  you commercial pricing on your entire purchase.
[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:29.420]  They've got a lot of great stuff in there.
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:33.100]  If they don't have what you want, they can definitely order it for you.
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:34.380]  It'll only take them a few days.
[01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:36.060]  They've got another location in Denver.
[01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:39.500]  So if you're at the Pueblo shop, if they don't have what you want, they can possibly get
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:40.220]  it from Denver.
[01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:41.580]  If not, they'll get it from the vendor.
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:43.100]  They'll get it from a distributor.
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:44.060]  It will be there.
[01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:44.940]  It'll be fresh.
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:45.900]  It'll be new.
[01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:46.700]  It'll be awesome.
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:49.900]  So make sure you shop at Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:55.420]  Also, you guys, I want to remind you that NatureIsGreenRemedies.com has changed their
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:56.140]  name.
[01:36:56.140 --> 01:37:00.460]  Their website is now under TheDankTeam.com.
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:04.620]  The D-A-N-K-T-E-A-M.com.
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:06.460]  TheDankTeam.com.
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:08.860]  So make sure you check out TheDankTeam.com.
[01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:12.300]  Get all your feminized and regularized seeds from them.
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:15.580]  They are most likely sold out of all iRegenetics products.
[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:19.980]  They may have some Dubwise left, but they don't have much if they do have anything.
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:23.900]  You guys, if you're interested in sponsoring the podcast, or if you've got a product you'd
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:25.660]  like me to review, just send me an email.
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.420]  It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:29.500]  I'll get you all the information that you need.
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:33.020]  Now that the show's over, you guys, please go to iTunes.
[01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:34.220]  Go to the iTunes store.
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:36.060]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:37.580]  Find the review section.
[01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:38.780]  Give me a five-star rating.
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:41.740]  And after that, type in a comment and let me know what you think of the show.
[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:44.940]  And I promise you, I will read your comment on a future episode.
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:47.580]  If you want to leave a comment on Stitcher, you can do that.
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:51.340]  But I do not promise you that I will find it because Stitcher likes to change the way
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:53.820]  comments are left, and it kind of sucks.
[01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:55.580]  You can always contact me on Facebook.
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:58.380]  It's growfromyourheart on Facebook, right?
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:37:59.020]  Yeah.
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:01.100]  You can find me on Twitter.

[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:04.300]  Of course, there's the email.
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:06.060]  It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:08.540]  I love all the social media interaction.
[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:10.060]  Don't forget about all that stuff.

[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:36.540]  testing.

[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:46.700]  You guys, I added a donation button to the podcast page a little while back.
[01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:48.860]  A couple of people have taken advantage of that.
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:50.780]  Big shout out and thank you to those guys.
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:53.580]  If you feel like the show was worth a few bucks, you can always go to the website.

[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:03.260]  It goes directly to my PayPal account.

[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:07.100]  The show is always going to be free.

[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:11.020]  It's my gift to you.
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:16.460]  I feel like I've been blessed with knowledge for this plant.
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:19.900]  And I feel like you'd be ashamed to share this and keep it to myself.
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:21.660]  So I want to share this knowledge with you guys.

[01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:31.660]  So I would appreciate that.
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:32.380]  You guys, I said it.
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:33.340]  We're already on.
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:33.820]  I already said it.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:35.100]  We're on all the social media sites.
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:36.140]  Make sure you check that out.
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:38.780]  Make sure you follow iRegenetics on Instagram.
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:43.660]  I just got 17,000 Instagram followers because I've been posting up pictures of the fire.
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:47.340]  You guys have also been putting up my Periscope rants on YouTube.
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:49.180]  iRegenetics has a YouTube channel.
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:53.500]  If you want to see some amusing videos of me just taking dabs late at night, I'm checking
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.020]  out the furniture table on YouTube.
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:57.260]  I review some hash on the YouTube channel.
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:59.500]  So check that out if you would like.
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:00.860]  Go subscribe to that.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:04.620]  Click like on some of the videos because I'm going to get my tongue repaired before the
[01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:05.180]  next episode.
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:08.620]  I'm having a hard time speaking English here toward the end of the show.
[01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:09.980]  So I'm going to wrap it up.
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:13.020]  I want to give you a big thank you for listening to this podcast.
[01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:16.220]  I really appreciate you guys supporting me, for following the things that I do.
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:18.460]  It's really fun to have people that are so interactive.
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:22.060]  I've got a lot of loyal fans, and I appreciate you guys until the very end.
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:23.900]  I'll be back in another week.
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:28.940]  The next episode is going to be about pH and why pH is important and what it does for
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:29.980]  your plants.
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:34.220]  I will probably have another news article, and then I'll be back in the future with a
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:35.980]  lot more grow lessons.
[01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:38.140]  You guys, I want to give a big shout out to my ninja spits.
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:38.940]  Thanks again for listening.
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:42.860]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:45.980]  Before I sign off, I'd like to dedicate this episode to Brian Ritchie.
[01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:48.300]  May your music and your memory live forever.
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:44:06.490]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:44:06.490 --> 01:44:09.290]  It's time for episode number 88 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:44:09.850 --> 01:44:13.610]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:44:13.610 --> 01:44:13.930]  That's right.
[01:44:13.930 --> 01:44:17.370]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[01:44:17.370 --> 01:44:21.530]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the current
[01:44:21.530 --> 01:44:25.450]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:44:25.450 --> 01:44:26.010]  I'm your host.
[01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:26.970]  They call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:44:26.970 --> 01:44:28.570]  I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[01:44:28.570 --> 01:44:31.770]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots band for letting
[01:44:31.770 --> 01:44:33.050]  me use their music on my show.
[01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:36.970]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:44:36.970 --> 01:44:40.090]  Right now, you guys are listening to a song called the Doggy Dub off of the album The
[01:44:40.090 --> 01:44:41.130]  Constant Struggle.
[01:44:41.130 --> 01:44:44.810]  Make sure you support the Mystic Roots and check out the album The Constant Struggle.
[01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:47.050]  My favorite album from them is called Cali High.
[01:44:47.050 --> 01:44:48.010]  Make sure you check that out.
[01:44:48.570 --> 01:44:49.290]  How are you guys doing?
[01:44:49.290 --> 01:44:50.730]  I hope everyone's having a great week.
[01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:52.890]  I'm coming to you on a Wednesday.
[01:44:52.890 --> 01:44:55.050]  It is 7 10 in the evening.
[01:44:55.050 --> 01:44:58.170]  It's actually about 7 15 because you know what I did at 7 10.
[01:44:58.330 --> 01:45:00.170]  I had a nice little 7 10 session.
[01:45:00.170 --> 01:45:02.010]  I hope you guys all had a nice 7 10.
[01:45:02.010 --> 01:45:05.050]  I hope wherever you are, whatever you're doing, I hope you're loading up a bowl.
[01:45:05.050 --> 01:45:06.330]  I hope you're twisting up a joint.
[01:45:06.330 --> 01:45:08.250]  I hope you're packing up the vaporizer.
[01:45:08.250 --> 01:45:09.450]  Maybe you're eating an edible.
[01:45:09.450 --> 01:45:10.650]  I hope you're heating up the nail.
[01:45:10.650 --> 01:45:12.250]  I hope you're taking a dab with me.
[01:45:12.250 --> 01:45:17.770]  I hope that in some way, shape, or form, you are consuming some type of high grade, high
[01:45:17.770 --> 01:45:21.290]  quality, super delicious dank cannabis products with me right now.
[01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:21.850]  I hope so.
[01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:26.970]  Big shout out to whoever is smoking, toking, dabbing, eating some edibles.
[01:45:26.970 --> 01:45:27.930]  Big shout out to everybody.
[01:45:27.930 --> 01:45:28.890]  I hope you guys are joining me.
[01:45:29.530 --> 01:45:30.410]  Hope it's organic.
[01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:31.130]  I hope it's clean.
[01:45:31.130 --> 01:45:32.330]  I hope it's fresh.
[01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.810]  All right.
[01:45:32.810 --> 01:45:34.970]  So I've got a couple of things I want to talk about.
[01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:39.210]  I want to take a minute to give a huge thank you to my friend, Sonny.
[01:45:39.210 --> 01:45:41.050]  Sonny sometimes listens to this show.
[01:45:41.050 --> 01:45:44.730]  I also want to thank Ravay, a couple other people that you guys probably have never heard
[01:45:44.730 --> 01:45:45.210]  of.
[01:45:45.210 --> 01:45:51.370]  I especially want to thank Donovan McNeely, Dan Lazzarini, Kenny Nicholson, Wayne DeHerrera.
[01:45:51.370 --> 01:45:52.730]  The list just goes on and on.
[01:45:52.730 --> 01:45:54.010]  So I'll tell you what I'm talking about.
[01:45:54.650 --> 01:45:58.970]  Unfortunately, a couple of weeks ago, a good friend of mine by the name of Brian Ritchie,
[01:45:58.970 --> 01:45:59.690]  he passed away.
[01:45:59.690 --> 01:46:02.330]  He left this earth and he left us a little saddened.
[01:46:03.050 --> 01:46:04.410]  Brian was a great musician.
[01:46:04.410 --> 01:46:10.170]  Brian is probably, let's see, Brian was probably close to 40 years older than me.
[01:46:11.050 --> 01:46:13.530]  Pretty close, 35 to 40 years older than myself.
[01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:15.610]  I met Brian.
[01:46:15.610 --> 01:46:19.290]  I was a musician just starting out and I was playing in a club and Brian saw me play and
[01:46:19.290 --> 01:46:23.050]  he said, young man, you've got a gift and my band needs a drummer and I'd like you to
[01:46:23.050 --> 01:46:23.610]  play with us.
[01:46:24.250 --> 01:46:26.250]  And you know, this old guy approaches me and asked me to play.
[01:46:26.250 --> 01:46:28.330]  I kind of thought, I don't want to play with a bunch of old guys.
[01:46:28.330 --> 01:46:29.610]  I'm a young rock star.
[01:46:29.610 --> 01:46:30.890]  But for some reason I did it.
[01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:33.610]  Something in my heart said, you should go play with these old guys and see what they're
[01:46:33.610 --> 01:46:33.930]  doing.
[01:46:34.650 --> 01:46:37.050]  And until I played with them, I was not a drummer.
[01:46:37.050 --> 01:46:40.330]  I was a guy with a drum set that was hitting drums with my friends.
[01:46:41.690 --> 01:46:46.330]  Brian and the band I joined with Brian turned me into a musician.
[01:46:46.330 --> 01:46:48.250]  I was not a musician until that point.
[01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:51.770]  Brian gave me musical career advice.
[01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:53.370]  Brian gave me stage advice.
[01:46:54.010 --> 01:46:56.890]  Brian taught me a lot about being a professional musician.
[01:46:56.890 --> 01:47:02.890]  Brian took me out of the bar mentality of playing as a bar musician, just playing for
[01:47:02.890 --> 01:47:04.410]  free beer, trying to be a rock star.
[01:47:04.410 --> 01:47:10.090]  He put me in the mentality and mindset of a working drummer and I will never forget that.
[01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:15.530]  So I'm always grateful to Brian Ritchie for the, what did he see in me?
[01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:16.810]  He had confidence in me.
[01:47:16.810 --> 01:47:21.130]  He had faith in me and he saw that and he put me behind the drums in his band when I
[01:47:21.130 --> 01:47:23.930]  wasn't ready and let me earn my position there.
[01:47:23.930 --> 01:47:25.850]  And I worked hard to be the drummer that he needed.
[01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:29.450]  So I've been going on for a long time about it, but Brian, I miss you, bro.
[01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:31.450]  Thanks for what you did to my musical career.
[01:47:31.450 --> 01:47:34.010]  Thanks for what you did to my mindset as a musician.
[01:47:34.570 --> 01:47:37.930]  Now, what I'm getting to is Saturday, we threw a giant party.
[01:47:37.930 --> 01:47:42.650]  Brian didn't want a funeral because he didn't want sadness, but I thought that it was my
[01:47:42.650 --> 01:47:48.650]  duty to throw a party for the man and get all of our favorite mutual friends and musicians
[01:47:48.730 --> 01:47:54.010]  together in one room and play one big jam and one last hurrah for our friend, Brian.
[01:47:54.730 --> 01:47:57.770]  So I organized an event in my friend Sonny's house.
[01:47:57.770 --> 01:48:01.370]  He's got a large jam space with like a large jam room.
[01:48:01.370 --> 01:48:02.810]  His house is like a club.
[01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:05.450]  He's got a small club attached to the back of his house.
[01:48:06.010 --> 01:48:07.450]  So I made a Facebook event.
[01:48:07.450 --> 01:48:09.370]  I sent out a few phone calls, a few invites.
[01:48:09.370 --> 01:48:12.250]  I got our old band together, came and jammed.
[01:48:12.250 --> 01:48:16.250]  Another band that Brian was in came and jammed and a bunch of Brian's old friends came and
[01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:16.890]  played music.
[01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:17.930]  We had a potluck.
[01:48:17.930 --> 01:48:19.770]  Big shout out to George Samaras.
[01:48:19.770 --> 01:48:20.970]  He brought a lot of great goodies.
[01:48:20.970 --> 01:48:22.170]  I appreciate that.
[01:48:22.170 --> 01:48:24.410]  Big shout out to everybody who attended the party.
[01:48:24.410 --> 01:48:26.330]  Big shout out to everybody who played at the party.
[01:48:26.330 --> 01:48:28.970]  Big shout out to Danielle for helping me organize the party.
[01:48:29.690 --> 01:48:33.850]  This party meant a lot to me and it was a complete success and I am totally satisfied
[01:48:33.850 --> 01:48:38.090]  and grateful and I wanted to share all of it with you guys and give a big thank you
[01:48:38.090 --> 01:48:40.650]  to everybody so everyone can hear it all at once.
[01:48:40.650 --> 01:48:41.770]  I hope you guys are listening.
[01:48:41.770 --> 01:48:42.570]  We'll move on.
[01:48:42.570 --> 01:48:42.970]  I'm sorry, guys.
[01:48:42.970 --> 01:48:46.810]  I don't want to ramble about this party too much, but I was super excited and I feel like
[01:48:46.810 --> 01:48:49.050]  I wanted to thank everybody on the podcast publicly.
[01:48:49.050 --> 01:48:49.770]  So thank you, guys.
[01:48:49.770 --> 01:48:50.570]  I appreciate it.
[01:48:51.130 --> 01:48:53.770]  It's good to know that I can put together a party like that.
[01:48:54.570 --> 01:48:58.890]  I only had about four or five days to organize and I got about 80 people in this place.
[01:48:58.890 --> 01:49:00.090]  So I was really proud.
[01:49:00.090 --> 01:49:02.490]  I was really happy to honor Brian that way.
[01:49:02.490 --> 01:49:03.690]  So big shout out to everybody.
[01:49:03.690 --> 01:49:04.730]  Brian, I miss you, bro.
[01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:06.250]  We will move on.
[01:49:07.050 --> 01:49:10.010]  A few weeks ago, well, it's been ongoing.
[01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:15.370]  Over the past few weeks, we have talked about a raid that happened at a Santa Ana, California
[01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:16.330]  dispensary.
[01:49:16.330 --> 01:49:17.930]  I'll give you guys a little update.
[01:49:17.930 --> 01:49:19.610]  These cops raided a dispensary.
[01:49:20.410 --> 01:49:22.970]  They treated all of the people in the dispensary like shit.
[01:49:23.770 --> 01:49:28.730]  Once the dispensary was emptied of people, they took down all the cameras and then they
[01:49:28.730 --> 01:49:32.570]  began to, they proceeded to destroy this dispensary.
[01:49:33.130 --> 01:49:34.410]  They broke the TVs.
[01:49:34.410 --> 01:49:36.090]  They broke the security systems.
[01:49:36.090 --> 01:49:37.850]  They caused damage to the safes.
[01:49:37.850 --> 01:49:40.330]  They caused a lot of damage to the displays.
[01:49:40.330 --> 01:49:46.730]  And then these police officers had the audacity to eat edibles on camera.
[01:49:46.730 --> 01:49:50.170]  There happened to be another hidden camera in the building that was recording that the
[01:49:50.170 --> 01:49:51.450]  cops didn't know about.
[01:49:51.450 --> 01:49:53.210]  And they were caught talking mad shit.
[01:49:53.210 --> 01:49:55.770]  They shouldn't have been saying they were eating edibles.
[01:49:55.770 --> 01:49:59.610]  They were playing darts and they were acting like assholes on camera.
[01:49:59.610 --> 01:50:01.210]  So they have been caught.
[01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:07.610]  The dispensary's lawyer discovered the video and filed a lawsuit against specific law
[01:50:07.610 --> 01:50:08.650]  enforcement officers.
[01:50:09.210 --> 01:50:11.370]  Now, here is where we are today.
[01:50:11.370 --> 01:50:16.810]  Here's an article that I found on Reason.com written by Jacob Solem.
[01:50:16.810 --> 01:50:21.130]  And the headline says, suspended cops say video of them eating marijuana edibles during
[01:50:21.130 --> 01:50:24.010]  a raid violated their privacy.
[01:50:24.010 --> 01:50:28.090]  The sub headline is Santa Ana officers want to stop their department from using the footage
[01:50:28.090 --> 01:50:29.530]  to investigate them.
[01:50:29.530 --> 01:50:30.970]  I'm going to go ahead and read you the article.
[01:50:30.970 --> 01:50:35.210]  It says, remember the Santa Ana, California cops who were caught on video munching on
[01:50:35.290 --> 01:50:40.330]  what seems to be cannabis infused chocolate bars after raiding an unlicensed medical marijuana
[01:50:40.330 --> 01:50:41.610]  dispensary in May.
[01:50:41.610 --> 01:50:45.610]  The Orange County Register reports that three officers who were suspended after the incident
[01:50:45.610 --> 01:50:51.610]  are trying to stop the Santa Ana Police Department from using the footage in its internal investigation.
[01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:55.770]  Among other things, their lawsuit argues that the officers thought they had disabled all
[01:50:55.770 --> 01:51:00.490]  of the security cameras at Sky High Holistic and therefore had a reasonable expectation
[01:51:00.490 --> 01:51:01.610]  of privacy.
[01:51:01.690 --> 01:51:06.170]  The cops complained that the dispensary never got their permission to record them as they
[01:51:06.170 --> 01:51:07.610]  searched the premises.
[01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:15.210]  So, these cops are trying to stop this video from being used in court because they were
[01:51:15.210 --> 01:51:20.410]  illegally recorded because since they had destroyed all of the security cameras, they
[01:51:20.410 --> 01:51:23.050]  therefore had a reasonable expectation of privacy.
[01:51:23.850 --> 01:51:31.850]  Now, that means that if I break into your house and you film me, fuck your film because
[01:51:31.850 --> 01:51:35.370]  I had an expectation of privacy while I broke into your house and stole all your shit.
[01:51:36.170 --> 01:51:37.370]  That's what these cops are saying.
[01:51:38.090 --> 01:51:39.050]  It's a two-way street.
[01:51:39.050 --> 01:51:41.290]  I don't think that a rule works just for cops.
[01:51:41.290 --> 01:51:43.290]  It doesn't work for civilians, right?
[01:51:43.290 --> 01:51:44.490]  These cops are trying to pull some shit.
[01:51:44.490 --> 01:51:45.290]  I'm going to keep reading here.
[01:51:45.290 --> 01:51:51.450]  It says, all police personnel present had a reasonable expectation that their conversations
[01:51:51.450 --> 01:51:55.530]  were no longer being recorded and the undercover officers feeling that they were safe to do
[01:51:55.530 --> 01:52:00.090]  so removed their masks, says the complaint, which was filed in Orange County Superior
[01:52:00.090 --> 01:52:00.810]  Court.
[01:52:00.810 --> 01:52:04.650]  Without the illegal recordings, there would have been no internal investigation of any
[01:52:04.650 --> 01:52:05.450]  officer.
[01:52:05.450 --> 01:52:10.730]  Under California law, all parties to a confidential communication must consent to being recorded,
[01:52:10.730 --> 01:52:15.370]  but that rule does not apply when the parties to the communication may reasonably expect
[01:52:15.370 --> 01:52:18.970]  that the communication may be overheard or recorded.
[01:52:18.970 --> 01:52:22.890]  In an interview with the Register, Sky High's lawyer, Matthew Pappas, noted that police
[01:52:22.890 --> 01:52:26.090]  routinely use surveillance camera video against suspects.
[01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:31.050]  It's pretty pathetic for police to say, if we don't like something that it can't be used
[01:52:31.050 --> 01:52:33.450]  as evidence, he said, they knew they were on video.
[01:52:33.450 --> 01:52:37.850]  Just because they missed one camera doesn't make it illegal.
[01:52:38.970 --> 01:52:43.930]  I think we all agree here that this is complete bullshit because if you or I were caught doing
[01:52:43.930 --> 01:52:48.890]  something on a film, no matter how that film was made, that film would be used against
[01:52:48.890 --> 01:52:50.330]  us in a court of law.
[01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:54.890]  That film would probably be edited by the opposing lawyers to make us look like a pile
[01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:55.690]  of shit.
[01:52:55.690 --> 01:52:59.930]  So I think that this videotape should definitely be used in a court of law.
[01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:05.370]  These people, in my opinion, they illegally fucking attacked, if you know more about the
[01:53:05.370 --> 01:53:08.810]  story, these people illegally singled out this dispensary.
[01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:11.610]  So I hope that this video is used in court.
[01:53:11.610 --> 01:53:15.690]  If not, there are bigger problems in America than we knew about.
[01:53:15.690 --> 01:53:20.250]  I want to give a huge shout out to Reason.com and also a big shout out to Jacob Solem.
[01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:25.130]  All right, you guys, my friend, Fred Garvin, recently sent me an email or was a Facebook
[01:53:25.130 --> 01:53:27.290]  message and it said, I don't remember exactly what it said.
[01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:31.530]  I'm going to kind of misquote him ridiculously, but he said, hey, Jeff, you used to do a bunch
[01:53:31.530 --> 01:53:32.170]  of grow lessons.
[01:53:32.170 --> 01:53:33.210]  That was what the show was about.
[01:53:33.210 --> 01:53:35.450]  And recently you were not doing grow lessons.
[01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:36.650]  What the hell happened?
[01:53:36.650 --> 01:53:37.770]  Fred, I agree with you.
[01:53:37.770 --> 01:53:39.290]  I've responded to you on Facebook.
[01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:41.210]  I addressed this on the last podcast.
[01:53:41.210 --> 01:53:42.810]  I completely agree with you, Fred.
[01:53:42.810 --> 01:53:44.970]  I need to get back to the grow lessons.
[01:53:44.970 --> 01:53:46.330]  So here's what I'm going to do.
[01:53:46.330 --> 01:53:52.410]  I'm going to take a fat dab and then I will be right back and we will talk about the importance
[01:53:52.410 --> 01:53:54.090]  of pH in your plants.
[01:53:54.090 --> 01:53:55.690]  So hang on for just one second, you guys.
[01:53:55.690 --> 01:53:58.650]  I'm going to take a dab, maybe get a drink and I will be right back.
[01:53:59.610 --> 01:54:03.130]  All right, you guys, I am back after a couple of dabs and I am feeling great.
[01:54:03.130 --> 01:54:05.210]  Now it's time to talk about pH a little bit.
[01:54:06.490 --> 01:54:07.450]  I've got a few notes here.
[01:54:07.450 --> 01:54:10.330]  I'm going to try to skim through these without sounding like I'm reading too much, but I
[01:54:10.330 --> 01:54:14.650]  needed some notes to keep myself on track because this has a lot of numbers and a lot
[01:54:14.650 --> 01:54:16.570]  of important things that we need to pay attention to.
[01:54:17.610 --> 01:54:18.730]  So let's get into it a little bit.
[01:54:20.090 --> 01:54:24.090]  Properly adjusting the pH of your nutrient solution can solve a lot of problems and it
[01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:26.170]  can greatly improve the quality of your crop.
[01:54:27.130 --> 01:54:32.170]  I still do a little bit of consulting and I really see a lot of people overlooking the
[01:54:32.170 --> 01:54:38.490]  pH of their nutrient solution and how important it is to adjust the pH of their nutrient solution
[01:54:38.490 --> 01:54:40.010]  before they feed their plants.
[01:54:40.810 --> 01:54:45.290]  These guys have a lot of problems in their gardens that look like nutrient deficiencies
[01:54:45.290 --> 01:54:47.850]  and I see them trying to correct nutrient deficiencies.
[01:54:47.850 --> 01:54:54.810]  Like a lot of times a pH imbalance will look like it'll camouflage itself as maybe a cow
[01:54:54.810 --> 01:54:57.770]  mag problem or maybe a phosphorus overload.
[01:54:58.650 --> 01:55:03.850]  But a lot of times it's just a simple pH problem that could have been solved by adjusting the
[01:55:03.850 --> 01:55:07.530]  pH of your nutrient solution before you fed it to your plants.
[01:55:08.490 --> 01:55:10.730]  A lot of people will talk about soil pH.
[01:55:10.730 --> 01:55:13.210]  A lot of people are going to talk about different areas of pH.
[01:55:13.210 --> 01:55:19.130]  What I'm going to talk about is the pH balance of your nutrient solution, whether it be soil
[01:55:19.130 --> 01:55:20.330]  or hydro.
[01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:27.850]  If you're working in soil, the optimum pH range for your soil garden is about 5.5 to
[01:55:27.850 --> 01:55:28.890]  6.5.
[01:55:29.530 --> 01:55:34.410]  If you were working in hydro, your optimum range is going to be somewhere between 5.8
[01:55:34.410 --> 01:55:35.690]  and 6.2.
[01:55:36.330 --> 01:55:39.850]  Now you keep hearing me say that we need to be within a certain pH range.
[01:55:40.570 --> 01:55:45.050]  It would be ideal to find a certain number and stick with it is what most folks would
[01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:45.370]  think.
[01:55:45.370 --> 01:55:52.010]  But the reason we need a pH range is because some nutrients that we're feeding our plants,
[01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:57.530]  some of the elements that our plants are trying to absorb are available at certain pH levels
[01:55:57.530 --> 01:55:59.850]  and some are available at different pH levels.
[01:55:59.850 --> 01:56:04.090]  So I'm going to pick like in soil, nitrogen is available.
[01:56:04.090 --> 01:56:06.010]  You can pretty much suck up nitrogen at any point.
[01:56:06.010 --> 01:56:06.890]  Let's look at iron.
[01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:12.090]  Iron is more available on the lower side of the pH scale, the 3.5 range.
[01:56:12.090 --> 01:56:16.730]  The 3.5 to about 6.5 is where you're going to pick up iron.
[01:56:16.730 --> 01:56:20.730]  But if you get any higher on the pH range, you stop absorbing the iron.
[01:56:21.370 --> 01:56:22.810]  Then we're going to look at calcium.
[01:56:23.370 --> 01:56:30.010]  Calcium doesn't absorb very well in the 5.0 range, but it does start picking up at 5.5
[01:56:30.010 --> 01:56:30.970]  to 6.5.
[01:56:30.970 --> 01:56:32.890]  You can really absorb calcium.
[01:56:32.890 --> 01:56:38.250]  But if you go out toward the 7.5 range, you stop picking up calcium.
[01:56:38.890 --> 01:56:45.690]  So these nutrients have a window where the pH is ideal for the plant to absorb each nutrient.
[01:56:45.690 --> 01:56:52.250]  And we have found that in soil, somewhere between 5.5 and 6.5 is when all of these nutrients
[01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:54.890]  become available at the same time, ideally.
[01:56:54.890 --> 01:57:00.330]  And in hydro, like we said earlier, it's 5.8 to 6.2 where these nutrients become available.
[01:57:00.330 --> 01:57:04.090]  And let me tell you that the graph on the hydro side is much smaller.
[01:57:04.090 --> 01:57:09.290]  You have a much more narrow window of nutrient availability due to pH.
[01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:14.490]  I know that's a lot to absorb, but once this clicks in, it'll definitely make sense to you.
[01:57:14.490 --> 01:57:16.090]  Let me try to explain it like this a little bit.
[01:57:16.090 --> 01:57:19.290]  When it's really hot outside, you don't want hot cocoa.
[01:57:19.290 --> 01:57:21.370]  But when it's really cold outside, you do.
[01:57:21.370 --> 01:57:23.770]  And then when it's really cold outside, you don't want ice cream.
[01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:26.570]  But when it's warm outside, you want ice cream.
[01:57:26.570 --> 01:57:31.290]  So what we got to do, we got to find that perfect day where you can have hot cocoa for breakfast,
[01:57:31.290 --> 01:57:33.210]  and you can have ice cream for lunch.
[01:57:33.210 --> 01:57:36.250]  And that's what we're trying to do for the plants by finding the perfect pH range.
[01:57:36.250 --> 01:57:39.930]  We're trying to find that optimum spot where they're in the mood for all of the nutrients
[01:57:39.930 --> 01:57:40.810]  we're feeding them.
[01:57:40.810 --> 01:57:45.130]  All right, now we should probably talk about what pH actually is and stands for.
[01:57:45.130 --> 01:57:47.210]  pH means potential hydrogen.
[01:57:47.210 --> 01:57:49.610]  It's written with a lowercase p and a capital H.
[01:57:49.610 --> 01:57:55.210]  And what pH is, is the measure of acid to alkalinity in our nutrient solution.
[01:57:56.170 --> 01:57:59.050]  pH is measured on a scale of zero to 14.
[01:57:59.770 --> 01:58:04.330]  Zero is the most acidic, seven is neutral, which means there's an equal concentration
[01:58:04.330 --> 01:58:06.570]  of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions.
[01:58:07.130 --> 01:58:09.290]  And then 14 is pure alkali.
[01:58:09.930 --> 01:58:11.850]  And it's measured on what is called a...
[01:58:13.130 --> 01:58:14.890]  I always fuck this word up.
[01:58:14.890 --> 01:58:16.570]  You only have to say it in this instance.
[01:58:16.570 --> 01:58:23.290]  It's a logarithmic scale, which means that every one point increase or decrease in pH
[01:58:23.690 --> 01:58:28.570]  reflects a tenfold change in acid or alkaline.
[01:58:28.570 --> 01:58:35.050]  So in a solution that's pH five, that solution is 10 times more acidic than a solution that
[01:58:35.050 --> 01:58:36.570]  is pH at six.
[01:58:36.570 --> 01:58:42.650]  So if you've got something that's pH at four, it's going to be 1000 times more acidic than
[01:58:42.650 --> 01:58:44.650]  a solution that's pH at six.
[01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:47.370]  So keep that in mind when you guys are using your pH pen.
[01:58:47.370 --> 01:58:50.250]  That's something that we'll talk about here in just a little bit, using your pH pen and
[01:58:50.250 --> 01:58:51.050]  your pH meter.
[01:58:51.370 --> 01:58:54.410]  You have to be really on the money when you're adjusting your pH.
[01:58:54.410 --> 01:58:58.090]  Once you found that range that your plants really like, you're going to want to try to
[01:58:58.090 --> 01:59:00.090]  set it right about there all the time.
[01:59:00.090 --> 01:59:04.490]  So if you're using soil, somewhere within that five, eight to six, five, if you're in
[01:59:04.490 --> 01:59:09.370]  hydro, somewhere in that five, six to six, three range, you're going to want to get your
[01:59:09.370 --> 01:59:13.770]  pH set and then keep an eye on the plants and then pay attention to where the plants...
[01:59:13.770 --> 01:59:15.690]  Each strain is going to be a little different, you guys.
[01:59:15.690 --> 01:59:19.930]  Pay attention to where each strain likes that fucking pH set and try to get it to the right
[01:59:20.090 --> 01:59:22.970]  set and try to get it there every time and take notes.
[01:59:22.970 --> 01:59:29.050]  And keep in mind that 0.1 on there is a huge difference in your pH.
[01:59:29.050 --> 01:59:31.050]  So you can't just say, I'm close enough.
[01:59:31.050 --> 01:59:32.170]  You got to get it close.
[01:59:32.170 --> 01:59:35.290]  And we'll talk about how to adjust the pH and measure that here pretty soon.
[01:59:35.850 --> 01:59:41.290]  So also you guys keep in mind, if you're running hydro, your pH is going to change possibly
[01:59:41.290 --> 01:59:45.690]  every day because you're going to have nutrients absorbed by the plants.
[01:59:45.690 --> 01:59:47.930]  You're going to have water evaporate.
[01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:52.410]  There are going to be so many things that happen causing your pH to change that you're
[01:59:52.410 --> 01:59:54.570]  going to have to be on that in hydro.
[01:59:54.570 --> 01:59:57.210]  In soil, you're just going to mix up the bucket.
[01:59:57.930 --> 02:00:02.090]  At the end, before you feed it to the plants, you will test it and then you will adjust it.
[02:00:02.810 --> 02:00:03.050]  All right.
[02:00:03.050 --> 02:00:06.650]  It actually seems like I'm getting to the part where I should start explaining how to
[02:00:06.650 --> 02:00:09.930]  pH test your water and then how to correct the pH.
[02:00:10.490 --> 02:00:12.730]  So let's get into that a little bit here.
[02:00:13.210 --> 02:00:18.490]  First, if you're mixing a hydro kit, go ahead and mix it in your reservoir, fill it up.
[02:00:19.130 --> 02:00:20.330]  Gosh, excuse me.
[02:00:20.330 --> 02:00:21.450]  Fill up your res with water.
[02:00:22.170 --> 02:00:24.010]  However, you normally do it to the recommended amount.
[02:00:24.010 --> 02:00:27.850]  If you got a 25 gallon res, go ahead and do 25 gallons if you're doing a hydro kit.
[02:00:27.850 --> 02:00:31.370]  If you're doing soil and you do five gallon buckets or you got a big res, fill that up
[02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:33.450]  however you normally would with the amount you normally would.
[02:00:34.330 --> 02:00:36.970]  Then mix in your nutrients just like you normally would.
[02:00:36.970 --> 02:00:38.410]  I'm going to give a shout out to my buddy, John.
[02:00:38.410 --> 02:00:41.210]  He taught me something and I don't know how valid this is, but it made sense.
[02:00:41.210 --> 02:00:45.930]  John says, if you're using potassium silicates, pour that in your water very first.
[02:00:46.970 --> 02:00:48.330]  He had a good sound reason.
[02:00:48.330 --> 02:00:50.890]  One day we'll get John on the show and he can explain why.
[02:00:50.890 --> 02:00:53.450]  John says, pour your potassium silicate first.
[02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:57.610]  Then if you're going to use CalMag, do your CalMag next and then do all of your other
[02:00:57.610 --> 02:00:58.650]  nutrients after that.
[02:01:00.330 --> 02:01:04.250]  His reasoning made sense and I don't want to try to butcher the reason that he told me.
[02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:06.650]  So one day we'll get John on the show to talk about it.
[02:01:06.650 --> 02:01:10.730]  If you're a listener and you have a good example of why and you can explain it,
[02:01:10.730 --> 02:01:13.130]  send me an email and I would like to see what you're thinking.
[02:01:13.130 --> 02:01:16.010]  I want to see if somebody else is on the same page as my buddy, John.
[02:01:16.010 --> 02:01:20.730]  So fill your reservoir, mix your nutrients in there, do your potassium silicate first,
[02:01:20.730 --> 02:01:23.930]  then do your CalMag, then do the rest of your nutrients however you wish.
[02:01:24.570 --> 02:01:33.210]  Then now is the time when you need to use a pH pen or some type of pH meter or a pH probe.
[02:01:33.210 --> 02:01:39.370]  You need to stick that into this nutrient solution and you need to see what the display
[02:01:39.370 --> 02:01:42.010]  says, what the number reads on the display.
[02:01:42.010 --> 02:01:49.370]  If you can't afford a pH pen or a pH meter, you can use an aquarium test kit to tell you
[02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:50.170]  what the pH is.
[02:01:50.170 --> 02:01:52.010]  They sell them at the aquarium shop.
[02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:53.530]  You probably pick it up at Walmart.
[02:01:54.410 --> 02:02:00.010]  It's used in an aquarium environment to tell you what the pH of your aquarium water would
[02:02:00.010 --> 02:02:01.770]  be so that you don't kill your fish.
[02:02:01.770 --> 02:02:03.210]  It'll do the exact same thing.
[02:02:03.210 --> 02:02:04.970]  We're just testing for pH here.
[02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:07.530]  This stuff isn't going to go into your nutrient solution.
[02:02:07.530 --> 02:02:08.650]  You'll take some water out.
[02:02:10.810 --> 02:02:13.050]  Actually, you'll dip this strip into the water.
[02:02:13.050 --> 02:02:14.730]  I don't even remember how to use the reagent.
[02:02:14.730 --> 02:02:15.610]  Shit, it's been that long.
[02:02:16.410 --> 02:02:19.370]  You put some water on it and then you drop these chemicals on it and it shows you what
[02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:21.290]  color it is and you measure it up to the color.
[02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:23.690]  And if it's like real blue, then you're the wrong way.
[02:02:23.690 --> 02:02:25.050]  And if it's real red, you're the wrong way.
[02:02:25.050 --> 02:02:26.330]  You want to get kind of in the middle.
[02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:28.570]  But those test strips, they're kind of a pain in the ass, you guys.
[02:02:28.570 --> 02:02:29.610]  You can tell by my description.
[02:02:29.610 --> 02:02:30.810]  That's why I haven't used it in years.
[02:02:30.810 --> 02:02:32.170]  That's why I'll never use it again.
[02:02:32.170 --> 02:02:35.130]  Get yourself a good pH pen or a pH meter.
[02:02:35.690 --> 02:02:38.090]  The pens are way easier to use.
[02:02:38.090 --> 02:02:40.170]  Do not drop your pen in the water.
[02:02:40.170 --> 02:02:40.970]  It'll be toast.
[02:02:42.490 --> 02:02:43.850]  Keep your pen calibrated.
[02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:47.450]  If you don't know how to calibrate it, take it to your local grow shop and they will probably
[02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:49.050]  calibrate it for you.
[02:02:49.050 --> 02:02:51.690]  And after the third or fourth time, they'll get tired of doing it and they will teach
[02:02:51.690 --> 02:02:52.490]  you how to do it.
[02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:53.930]  Just go ask them how to do it.
[02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:56.090]  They'll calibrate your pH pen for you.
[02:02:56.090 --> 02:03:01.450]  Always keep, no matter what type of pH pen you're using, always keep the probe, the tip,
[02:03:01.450 --> 02:03:04.330]  that white part in there, always keep that wet.
[02:03:04.330 --> 02:03:09.530]  Here's something to remember with a pH pen, a pH tester, a pH probe, other than the reagent.
[02:03:09.530 --> 02:03:13.530]  If you're using the expensive, any kind of pen that you dip in the water, if it dries,
[02:03:13.530 --> 02:03:14.650]  it dies.
[02:03:14.650 --> 02:03:16.250]  That is the thing to remember.
[02:03:16.250 --> 02:03:17.450]  If it dries, it dies.
[02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:22.090]  Keep your pH pen wet, keep it calibrated, keep it clean, and keep it handy all the time.
[02:03:23.610 --> 02:03:27.770]  I, myself, I use the Bluelab 3-in-1 Combo.
[02:03:27.770 --> 02:03:32.330]  It's got a pH meter, a PPM meter, and a temperature gauge on there.
[02:03:32.330 --> 02:03:33.530]  That's called a thermometer, right?
[02:03:33.530 --> 02:03:35.130]  Yeah, it's got that on there.
[02:03:35.130 --> 02:03:36.330]  It's a 3-in-1 Combo.
[02:03:36.330 --> 02:03:37.770]  It's a little pricey.
[02:03:37.770 --> 02:03:39.610]  If you can't afford that, get yourself...
[02:03:40.330 --> 02:03:41.930]  Those yellow Milwaukee's work.
[02:03:43.130 --> 02:03:47.850]  If you go to the grocery and you look for a pH pen, you'll see the yellow Milwaukee pH meter.
[02:03:47.850 --> 02:03:49.930]  That thing's a piece of shit, but it will work.
[02:03:49.930 --> 02:03:51.130]  It'll do what you need done.
[02:03:51.130 --> 02:03:52.410]  I would recommend a better one.
[02:03:52.410 --> 02:03:56.730]  If you can afford a more expensive, higher quality pH meter, I would go for it.
[02:03:56.730 --> 02:03:59.370]  But that little yellow Milwaukee piece of shit will work.
[02:03:59.370 --> 02:04:02.730]  It will die on you soon, so be prepared to buy another one.
[02:04:02.730 --> 02:04:06.090]  If you can get the next upgraded one, whatever it is, do that.
[02:04:06.090 --> 02:04:08.410]  Like I said, I like Bluelab products.
[02:04:08.410 --> 02:04:11.450]  My buddy John was telling me he likes another brand for some reason.
[02:04:11.450 --> 02:04:12.570]  I stick with the Bluelab.
[02:04:12.570 --> 02:04:14.090]  I've never had any problems.
[02:04:15.210 --> 02:04:16.010]  That's what I would do.
[02:04:16.730 --> 02:04:18.330]  So you stick the meter in there.
[02:04:19.050 --> 02:04:20.650]  So you fill up your reservoir.
[02:04:20.650 --> 02:04:22.490]  You mix your nutrients in the proper order.
[02:04:23.130 --> 02:04:24.170]  You let it be...
[02:04:24.170 --> 02:04:25.930]  It's got to be at about room temperature, you guys.
[02:04:25.930 --> 02:04:29.850]  You don't want your water too hot or too cold because that will definitely affect the pH.
[02:04:31.050 --> 02:04:32.250]  Get it at room temperature.
[02:04:32.330 --> 02:04:33.370]  Maybe set it in the grow room.
[02:04:33.370 --> 02:04:36.410]  If it's coming out of the faucet too hot or too cold, go set it in your grow room for a little
[02:04:36.410 --> 02:04:39.210]  while so that it's the same temperature as your room.
[02:04:39.210 --> 02:04:41.210]  Then mix your nutrients into there.
[02:04:41.210 --> 02:04:42.650]  Then put your pH meter in there.
[02:04:43.210 --> 02:04:44.250]  It's going to show a number.
[02:04:45.130 --> 02:04:51.130]  Hopefully, most municipal tap water comes out, depending on where you are, it's between eight
[02:04:51.130 --> 02:04:51.530]  and nine.
[02:04:51.530 --> 02:04:52.650]  Just depends on where you are.
[02:04:52.650 --> 02:04:54.810]  And that will change seasonally, you guys.
[02:04:54.810 --> 02:05:00.330]  Or when your local water company cleans their pipes or does some flushing or changes chemicals
[02:05:00.330 --> 02:05:04.970]  that they want to use, or it'll be seasonal for sure, pay attention because in the summer
[02:05:04.970 --> 02:05:08.250]  and in the winter, I can tell a huge difference in my water quality.
[02:05:08.890 --> 02:05:10.170]  So pay attention to that.
[02:05:10.170 --> 02:05:11.210]  Test your water once in a while.
[02:05:11.210 --> 02:05:14.490]  Just pour water out of the faucet, let it get to room temperature, stick your pH probe
[02:05:14.490 --> 02:05:16.810]  in there and see what it is occasionally, just for fun.
[02:05:16.810 --> 02:05:19.050]  You should always be testing everything that's going into your plants.
[02:05:19.690 --> 02:05:22.010]  I'm always curious about what's going into my plants.
[02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:24.090]  So you mix your stuff up.
[02:05:24.090 --> 02:05:24.810]  Where the hell was I?
[02:05:24.810 --> 02:05:26.970]  Mix your stuff up, stick your pH pen in there.
[02:05:26.970 --> 02:05:28.170]  It's going to show you a number.
[02:05:28.170 --> 02:05:30.090]  Hopefully, you're close.
[02:05:30.570 --> 02:05:35.210]  You're usually, once you've mixed your nutrients, you're hardly ever going to need pH up.
[02:05:35.210 --> 02:05:38.970]  If you need to put pH up in there, you probably are mixing your nutrients too strong.
[02:05:38.970 --> 02:05:40.970]  You're probably using something you shouldn't be using.
[02:05:40.970 --> 02:05:42.810]  You probably did something wrong.
[02:05:42.810 --> 02:05:43.530]  Probably.
[02:05:43.530 --> 02:05:46.170]  There are some instances where your pH will drop really low.
[02:05:46.170 --> 02:05:46.730]  That's okay.
[02:05:47.290 --> 02:05:49.050]  But you're going to need to bring it back up.
[02:05:49.050 --> 02:05:50.570]  That doesn't happen very frequently.
[02:05:52.010 --> 02:05:52.890]  You're going to be too high.
[02:05:52.890 --> 02:05:56.170]  You're probably going to be, once you mix up your nutrients, you're probably going to
[02:05:56.170 --> 02:05:57.770]  be about 7.2.
[02:05:57.770 --> 02:06:01.370]  You're going to need to get that down closer to the 6.5 range if you're in soil.
[02:06:01.930 --> 02:06:08.250]  If you're running hydro, you want to get that down closer to the 6.0 area, I guess.
[02:06:09.050 --> 02:06:14.970]  The way you're going to want to do that is slowly, very slowly, add your pH down.
[02:06:14.970 --> 02:06:16.010]  Just a little bit.
[02:06:16.010 --> 02:06:17.530]  You guys, don't get this shit in your eyes.
[02:06:17.530 --> 02:06:18.890]  Don't get it on your skin.
[02:06:18.890 --> 02:06:22.970]  If you're new at this and you're intimidated, or if you're a clumsy fucker, put on some
[02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:25.130]  gloves and put on some protective goggles.
[02:06:25.130 --> 02:06:26.650]  I have a friend who's in Michigan.
[02:06:26.650 --> 02:06:28.490]  I won't say his name because I don't want to embarrass you.
[02:06:29.290 --> 02:06:35.130]  But my friend Jason, he splashed some pH down into his eye just a little bit.
[02:06:35.130 --> 02:06:40.170]  He said he got a small drop of pH in his eye and he said he went completely blind in that
[02:06:40.170 --> 02:06:40.730]  eye.
[02:06:40.730 --> 02:06:45.530]  He said it was so excruciating that he couldn't open the other eye and he had to use Siri
[02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:51.690]  on his iPhone to call 911 to come to his house and help him and his grow because he couldn't
[02:06:51.690 --> 02:06:52.570]  fucking see.
[02:06:52.570 --> 02:06:54.490]  So don't put yourself in that kind of situation.
[02:06:54.490 --> 02:06:55.450]  You guys, be safe.
[02:06:56.010 --> 02:06:58.090]  If you're a clumsy fuck, wear some goggles.
[02:06:58.090 --> 02:07:01.530]  Even if you're a pro, it might be a good idea to wear some safety goggles or something when
[02:07:01.530 --> 02:07:02.410]  you're mixing this stuff.
[02:07:02.410 --> 02:07:08.090]  The pH adjusters can really, really mess with your eyes and your skin if they get on you
[02:07:08.090 --> 02:07:09.050]  and get in your eye.
[02:07:09.050 --> 02:07:11.850]  So pour a little bit of pH down in there.
[02:07:11.850 --> 02:07:14.090]  I would start with like five to 10 milliliters.
[02:07:14.090 --> 02:07:18.330]  That's five milliliters in a five-gallon bucket is probably enough to drop your pH down where
[02:07:18.330 --> 02:07:19.130]  you need it.
[02:07:19.130 --> 02:07:20.170]  Drop that in there.
[02:07:20.170 --> 02:07:21.530]  Shake it up real good.
[02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:24.890]  Put your pH meter back in there and see what you're testing now.
[02:07:24.890 --> 02:07:26.730]  You want to get it right on the money.
[02:07:27.450 --> 02:07:29.130]  You're going to have to fuck up a couple of batches.
[02:07:29.130 --> 02:07:33.610]  You might have to use pH up and down so many times that you just don't even want to use
[02:07:33.610 --> 02:07:38.570]  it because all the shit that you've just added to your solution, you got too much pH up and
[02:07:38.570 --> 02:07:40.170]  too much pH down in there.
[02:07:40.170 --> 02:07:42.890]  So you're going to have to just pour that out and start over.
[02:07:42.890 --> 02:07:43.850]  But don't be afraid.
[02:07:43.850 --> 02:07:45.130]  That's how you're going to learn, you guys.
[02:07:45.130 --> 02:07:47.530]  That is how you are going to learn.
[02:07:47.530 --> 02:07:52.570]  So add your pH up, add your pH down, whichever you need to do, and then test it.
[02:07:52.570 --> 02:07:56.330]  And once you've got it right where you want it, go ahead and pour that water into your
[02:07:56.330 --> 02:07:57.930]  plants if it's a soil garden.
[02:07:57.930 --> 02:08:02.010]  If it's a hydro garden, go ahead and start turning on the res and get it going, or the
[02:08:02.010 --> 02:08:02.970]  pumps or whatever you got to do.
[02:08:03.530 --> 02:08:05.130]  There's so many different ways to do hydro.
[02:08:05.130 --> 02:08:06.410]  You guys, I'm learning hydro.
[02:08:07.690 --> 02:08:07.930]  All right.
[02:08:07.930 --> 02:08:11.130]  I'm going to say that this lesson for pH is pretty much wrapped up.
[02:08:11.130 --> 02:08:13.370]  I feel like I've covered all of my bullet points.
[02:08:13.370 --> 02:08:16.490]  Keep in mind that your local water will change and you should check that out.
[02:08:18.730 --> 02:08:20.170]  That's the kind of shit that you should worry about.
[02:08:20.170 --> 02:08:23.850]  Your local water is going to change frequently and there's nothing that you can do about it.
[02:08:23.850 --> 02:08:25.770]  You're going to have to just be on top of that.
[02:08:25.770 --> 02:08:31.370]  The only way that you can really control your water is if you set up a reverse osmosis machine
[02:08:31.370 --> 02:08:35.770]  and you start cleaning everything out of all of your water and starting fresh.
[02:08:35.770 --> 02:08:37.210]  But that could be a whole other lesson.
[02:08:37.210 --> 02:08:39.930]  I will try to find a water expert.
[02:08:39.930 --> 02:08:45.210]  If you are listening and you're an expert on water and water quality for a grow, you let me know.
[02:08:45.210 --> 02:08:48.410]  I'll bring you on the show and you can teach us all about water.
[02:08:48.410 --> 02:08:54.250]  I know a lot about the plant, but there are so many niche areas that people have perfected.
[02:08:54.250 --> 02:08:58.890]  Our buddy Sean's got organics figured out and I seem to be the breeder in the group.
[02:08:58.890 --> 02:09:00.570]  And then Spence is the hatch guy.
[02:09:00.570 --> 02:09:03.530]  There are just so many small branches of this that we've got figured out that each
[02:09:03.530 --> 02:09:05.770]  person does their own little... has mastered.
[02:09:05.770 --> 02:09:07.770]  I'm going to try to get a water guy on here for you guys.
[02:09:08.490 --> 02:09:11.930]  We'll talk about water quality and what you should be looking for.
[02:09:11.930 --> 02:09:13.850]  That could probably be just a segment.
[02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:17.530]  Anyway, I was going to branch off and say, dude, I have been learning hydro.
[02:09:17.530 --> 02:09:20.970]  I've been talking to my buddy John that works with me at the spot.
[02:09:20.970 --> 02:09:22.410]  He is the hydro master.
[02:09:23.130 --> 02:09:27.850]  I will be learning so much hydro in a crash course here in the next few months that you
[02:09:27.850 --> 02:09:29.850]  guys are going to learn hydro with me.
[02:09:29.850 --> 02:09:31.050]  I will learn a bunch.
[02:09:31.050 --> 02:09:34.410]  I will start sharing the hydro talk with you guys.
[02:09:34.410 --> 02:09:40.250]  We're building the most killer grow facility at the spot dispensary in Pueblo, West Colorado.
[02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:42.970]  You guys, there are over a hundred lights in flower.
[02:09:42.970 --> 02:09:45.050]  There are four flowering rooms broken down.
[02:09:45.610 --> 02:09:47.930]  They have 24 to 26 lights per room.
[02:09:49.530 --> 02:09:51.450]  We've got a really nice veg area.
[02:09:52.170 --> 02:10:00.170]  We are running 50 foot long flood and drain tables that we fill up about 150 gallons worth
[02:10:00.170 --> 02:10:01.450]  of water for a res.
[02:10:01.450 --> 02:10:04.090]  We mix 150 gallons worth of newts.
[02:10:04.090 --> 02:10:06.730]  We pump that into the table at one end.
[02:10:06.730 --> 02:10:10.010]  It shoots all the way to the other end of the table, goes into a drain.
[02:10:10.570 --> 02:10:13.530]  There's a pump, a really snazzy pump.
[02:10:13.530 --> 02:10:18.010]  The quality they use at SeaWorld shoots all of that water through 50 feet of tubing.
[02:10:19.210 --> 02:10:24.250]  I think it's two inch or three inch PVC all the way back to the other end of the table.
[02:10:24.250 --> 02:10:27.610]  Then it dumps it back into the table and just keeps recirculating it.
[02:10:28.650 --> 02:10:32.570]  Under each plant, then we have, I can't really tell you too much about how we do the plant
[02:10:32.570 --> 02:10:34.730]  sites because that's kind of a proprietary thing.
[02:10:34.730 --> 02:10:39.450]  We've got each plant is designated its own site and it's in a rock wool cube.
[02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:46.890]  Underneath each rock wool cube and plant site, there is a ring shooting a lot of oxygen up
[02:10:46.890 --> 02:10:47.930]  underneath these plants.
[02:10:49.210 --> 02:10:52.010]  We're feeding from the bottom and the rock wool is wicking it up.
[02:10:52.730 --> 02:10:56.810]  Then we may, we're not sure if we want to do this yet, but there may be a drip line
[02:10:56.810 --> 02:11:02.650]  put in to top feed all of the plants so that we can drip that nutrient solution into the
[02:11:02.650 --> 02:11:06.730]  rock wool cube from the top and then just let the roots hang into that oxygenated water.
[02:11:06.730 --> 02:11:08.650]  You guys, I'm learning so damn much about hydro.
[02:11:08.970 --> 02:11:14.890]  I have built, we have built, I can't say I built, I've been involved in building a huge
[02:11:14.890 --> 02:11:18.890]  hydro environment and I've learned so much without even putting plants in there yet.
[02:11:18.890 --> 02:11:20.570]  We're almost ready for plants in there.
[02:11:22.490 --> 02:11:25.530]  We will be pulling harvest out of there in no time.
[02:11:25.530 --> 02:11:26.810]  It feels like we are so ready.
[02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:27.690]  I'm getting stoked.
[02:11:27.690 --> 02:11:31.290]  You guys can tell just by the tone of my voice that I'm fucking excited about the Grow With
[02:11:31.290 --> 02:11:32.090]  the Spot dispensary.
[02:11:32.090 --> 02:11:32.970]  Big shout out to the spot.
[02:11:32.970 --> 02:11:34.010]  Big shout out to Dave and Robert.
[02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:35.770]  Thanks for giving me the opportunity.
[02:11:35.770 --> 02:11:38.330]  Also, big shout out to the guys I've been working with, my grow crew, my
[02:11:38.330 --> 02:11:39.370]  construction crew.
[02:11:39.370 --> 02:11:40.570]  Big shout out to John.
[02:11:40.570 --> 02:11:41.690]  Big shout out to Joe.
[02:11:41.690 --> 02:11:43.290]  And a super shout out to Jaime.
[02:11:43.290 --> 02:11:44.010]  Love all you guys.
[02:11:44.010 --> 02:11:44.810]  Thanks for helping me out.
[02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:45.610]  Thanks for supporting me.
[02:11:45.610 --> 02:11:48.490]  Thanks for seeing the vision and thanks for being a good team.
[02:11:48.490 --> 02:11:49.050]  All right.
[02:11:49.050 --> 02:11:50.570]  That's a big ridiculous shout out right there.
[02:11:50.570 --> 02:11:51.850]  I'm glad I got that one off my chest.
[02:11:51.850 --> 02:11:53.050]  You guys, I want to thank you for listening.
[02:11:53.050 --> 02:11:55.130]  It feels like it's almost time to wrap up the show.
[02:11:55.130 --> 02:11:57.850]  Since you've listened to this far, I'm going to do this to you.
[02:11:57.850 --> 02:12:00.650]  This podcast was of course brought to you by my good friends at Hygro and their growing
[02:12:00.650 --> 02:12:01.210]  supplies.
[02:12:01.210 --> 02:12:03.610]  Hygro does have two locations to serve Colorado.
[02:12:03.610 --> 02:12:04.570]  They have a Denver store.
[02:12:04.570 --> 02:12:06.490]  It's on 6271 Beach Street.
[02:12:06.490 --> 02:12:07.530]  And then there's my favorite.
[02:12:07.530 --> 02:12:12.250]  It's the Pueblo location on 618 East 4th Street in beautiful Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:12:12.250 --> 02:12:15.930]  Check out Hygro for competitive pricing and a great selection of indoor growing supplies.
[02:12:15.930 --> 02:12:18.810]  You guys, when you're at Hygro and you're checking out, tell them that you listened
[02:12:18.810 --> 02:12:22.970]  to the Grow From Your Heart podcast and they will give you commercial pricing on your entire
[02:12:22.970 --> 02:12:23.370]  purchase.
[02:12:23.370 --> 02:12:28.170]  That'll save you a bunch of bucks, which is always a good thing because money is expensive
[02:12:28.170 --> 02:12:28.810]  these days.
[02:12:29.370 --> 02:12:29.770]  All right.
[02:12:30.330 --> 02:12:31.610]  No more ads, you guys.
[02:12:31.610 --> 02:12:32.570]  I won't do any more ads.
[02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:32.970]  That's the end.
[02:12:32.970 --> 02:12:34.090]  We're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.
[02:12:34.090 --> 02:12:36.010]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[02:12:36.010 --> 02:12:39.850]  You guys, now that the show is over, make sure you go to iTunes.
[02:12:39.850 --> 02:12:43.690]  Go to the iTunes store, find the review section, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast,

[02:12:50.330 --> 02:12:52.170]  If you think the show is awesome, tell me.
[02:12:52.170 --> 02:12:53.770]  I'll keep doing exactly what I'm doing.
[02:12:53.770 --> 02:12:55.450]  I appreciate the feedback.
[02:12:55.450 --> 02:12:59.050]  Also, I'd love for you guys to participate in the social media.
[02:12:59.050 --> 02:13:00.090]  I'm on Facebook.
[02:13:00.090 --> 02:13:01.770]  It's Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:13:01.770 --> 02:13:02.650]  I'm on Twitter.
[02:13:02.650 --> 02:13:04.810]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[02:13:04.810 --> 02:13:07.850]  We are on Instagram under at Iree Genetics.
[02:13:07.850 --> 02:13:09.450]  I love all of the interaction.
[02:13:09.450 --> 02:13:11.210]  I'd love to see you guys get involved.
[02:13:11.210 --> 02:13:15.210]  I haven't been doing as much Periscope videos lately because I've just been busy with work,
[02:13:15.210 --> 02:13:17.610]  but I will get back on that one because that's a lot of fun.
[02:13:18.570 --> 02:13:21.130]  If you have something to say and you don't want to say it on the social media,
[02:13:21.130 --> 02:13:22.090]  you can always email me.

[02:14:10.170 --> 02:14:12.010]  your tax money and doing whatever they want with it.
[02:14:12.010 --> 02:14:14.330]  So if you want to make a contribution, I would appreciate that.
[02:14:15.370 --> 02:14:16.330]  I'll give you a shout out.
[02:14:16.330 --> 02:14:17.050]  That's enough begging.
[02:14:17.050 --> 02:14:18.250]  I'll quit begging for that now.
[02:14:19.210 --> 02:14:23.930]  I'm working on getting the new Zoom H6 so that we can take the podcast on the road,
[02:14:23.930 --> 02:14:27.690]  go do the show at a few more places, go visit the Grimy Gatsby since we can't get you to come
[02:14:27.690 --> 02:14:28.730]  down to Pueblo.
[02:14:28.730 --> 02:14:31.130]  We'll do a podcast with Damsel in Colorado Springs.
[02:14:31.130 --> 02:14:33.210]  If we get the Zoom H6, we'll get a lot of shit going on.
[02:14:33.930 --> 02:14:36.090]  But I think that's all I got for you today, you guys.
[02:14:36.090 --> 02:14:37.770]  Make sure you follow me on Instagram.
[02:14:37.770 --> 02:14:38.890]  It's at I Read Genetics.
[02:14:38.890 --> 02:14:41.610]  I just hit 17,000 followers recently.
[02:14:41.610 --> 02:14:42.250]  See what I'm doing?
[02:14:42.250 --> 02:14:45.210]  I'm posting pictures of the spot dispensaries build up there.
[02:14:45.210 --> 02:14:47.130]  I'm posting pictures of my personal grow up there.
[02:14:47.130 --> 02:14:49.130]  I'm posting pictures of my adventures up there.
[02:14:49.130 --> 02:14:50.650]  A lot of great shit to check out.
[02:14:50.650 --> 02:14:53.050]  So you guys, I want to give a big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[02:14:53.050 --> 02:14:53.930]  Thank you again for listening.
[02:14:53.930 --> 02:14:57.370]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:14:58.330 --> 02:15:00.170]  Kids, don't try this at home.
[02:15:02.170 --> 02:15:03.770]  Leave your appearance smoke alone.
[02:15:07.410 --> 02:15:08.610]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:15:09.570 --> 02:15:10.930]  Talking about drug green.
[02:15:11.650 --> 02:15:13.490]  Indoor, outdoor, sing green.
[02:15:13.490 --> 02:15:16.130]  I love the weed.
[02:15:16.130 --> 02:15:17.410]  Weed, weed.
[02:15:17.410 --> 02:15:18.050]  I love weed.
[02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:27.460]  Yes, we are in California.
[02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:32.420]  We plan to in the car proposition to 15.
[02:15:32.420 --> 02:15:33.860]  It's a medical need.
[02:15:33.860 --> 02:15:34.420]  Tell them out.
[02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:35.700]  Call it.
[02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:37.700]  Now we want to in Jamaica.
[02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:38.500]  We call it.
[02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:41.700]  Can you listen to the song?
[02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:42.740]  I got a smoke.
[02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:45.620]  Weed, weed.
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:46.340]  I love weed.
[02:15:53.790 --> 02:15:55.790]  Hem me, hem me.
[02:15:55.790 --> 02:15:57.870]  My bag is empty.
[02:15:58.430 --> 02:16:00.270]  Hem me, hem me.
[02:16:00.270 --> 02:16:02.030]  My bag should be plenty.
[02:16:03.630 --> 02:16:05.710]  To the car position to prevent.
[02:16:08.430 --> 02:16:10.110]  I actually did uv weed.
[02:16:10.110 --> 02:16:11.870]  Yes, you really need some weed.
[02:16:40.690 --> 02:16:42.610]  Wait, wait.
[02:16:42.610 --> 02:16:44.530]  I love weed had.

[02:18:43.860 --> 02:18:48.860]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shoutout to the Mystic Roots Band for letting me use their music on the show.
[02:18:48.860 --> 02:18:52.860]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[02:18:52.860 --> 02:18:54.860]  What's up you guys, I hope everybody's having a great day.
[02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:57.860]  I'm coming to you on a scorching hot Thursday.
[02:18:57.860 --> 02:19:00.860]  It is stupid hot today, but we're gonna deal with it.
[02:19:00.860 --> 02:19:03.860]  We're gonna drink a lot of water, we're gonna water up the plants,
[02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:08.860]  and we're gonna talk a little bit about some heat issues that some friends of mine have been having in their gardens.
[02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:11.860]  And we'll talk about ways to cure a little bit of heat problems.
[02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:12.860]  And then I've got some ranting to do.
[02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:18.860]  But before we get that far, this podcast is brought to you by my friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[02:19:18.860 --> 02:19:21.860]  Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations to serve Colorado.
[02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:29.860]  Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beach Street or check out the Pueblo location on 618 East 4th Street in beautiful Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:19:29.860 --> 02:19:33.860]  Check out Hygro for competitive pricing and a great selection of indoor grow supplies.
[02:19:33.860 --> 02:19:39.860]  You guys, when you're checking out at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies, make sure you let them know you listen to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:19:39.860 --> 02:19:43.860]  And they will give you commercial pricing on your entire purchase.
[02:19:43.860 --> 02:19:45.860]  That's right. You'll pay what I pay.
[02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:46.860]  It'll put some money back in your pocket.
[02:19:46.860 --> 02:19:50.860]  You guys, we all know that money is expensive these days.
[02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:52.860]  All right. We're gonna get on with the show here.
[02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:55.860]  I want to let you guys know that I'm recording with a new device today.
[02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:59.860]  I'm using the new Zoom H6 Handy Recorder.
[02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:03.860]  I got the Zoom H6 so that I'll be able to take this podcast on the road a little bit.
[02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:05.860]  It's a much smaller unit than what I've been using.
[02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:15.860]  This thing will fit in my back pocket and I can carry it around and I can do shows from events such as the Secret Cup, the Cannabis Cup or wherever we may be.
[02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:23.860]  So you guys look forward to episodes with special guests coming up because now I can take the show to them instead of trying to get people to come to me.
[02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:26.860]  I live in kind of a shitty part of Colorado where nobody wants to go.
[02:20:26.860 --> 02:20:31.860]  So it's hard to get like Damsel and Hunt and people like that to come here.
[02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:33.860]  But if I go to them, they're happy to be on the show.
[02:20:33.860 --> 02:20:38.860]  So it's been a few bucks. I got the Zoom H6. We will take this show on the road.
[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:42.860]  You guys, I'm gonna ask you to do me a favor. Since you're listening to the show, let me know what you think of the sound quality.
[02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:44.860]  Let me know if this quality is acceptable.
[02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:51.860]  Let me know if I've changed anything that you've noticed because if this isn't acceptable, I'll go back to using the main studio setup.
[02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:57.860]  I just wanted to pull this out, give it a try, see what it was like before I try to take it on the road and record with other people.
[02:20:57.860 --> 02:21:01.860]  So yeah, big shout out to the Zoom H6. Let me know what you think of it, you guys.
[02:21:02.860 --> 02:21:07.860]  Alright, so let's get into the show. I told you that I saw some ducting issues.
[02:21:07.860 --> 02:21:10.860]  I did a consultation for a friend of mine. I didn't even charge him for it the other day.
[02:21:10.860 --> 02:21:14.860]  But he's been saying, dude, my room is getting way too hot this summer. What can I do?
[02:21:14.860 --> 02:21:16.860]  And I was like, you know what? That's a good start of a podcast.
[02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:22.860]  So I walked in there and the first thing I see is messy ass ducting.
[02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:25.860]  This dude's got a decent grow room. He's got enough air conditioning. His plants look good.
[02:21:25.860 --> 02:21:30.860]  But his ducting was a complete mess, you guys. And I've seen a lot of messy ducting lately.
[02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:41.860]  On my visits and consultations. So one thing I want to tell you is keep in mind that every single twist and bend in your ducting reduces your airflow and adds to the workload of your blower.
[02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:50.860]  Whatever kind of inline fan you're using, every bend puts more strain and more pressure on that inline fan and slows down the amount of air you're moving.
[02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:56.860]  So ideally, ducting would be in a straight line with zero curves or bends or twists or anything like that.
[02:21:56.860 --> 02:22:00.860]  But I know that's not rational because of course we're growing in houses and things like that.
[02:22:00.860 --> 02:22:04.860]  And you have to move the air around and not a straight line sometimes.
[02:22:04.860 --> 02:22:08.860]  But try to get it as straight as you can. That'll save you a lot of money on heating costs.
[02:22:08.860 --> 02:22:11.860]  It'll save you money because you don't have to run the blower as hard.
[02:22:11.860 --> 02:22:13.860]  It'll save you money because you're more efficiently cooling.
[02:22:13.860 --> 02:22:15.860]  So straighten out.
[02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:20.860]  Oh, I just noticed something. When you put the cell phone too close to the H6, you get a little bit of interference.
[02:22:20.860 --> 02:22:22.860]  So that's good to know. Sorry about that, guys. I hope you didn't hear that too much.
[02:22:22.860 --> 02:22:25.860]  I'm reading notes off of my cell phone here, which is why I did that.
[02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:27.860]  Anyway, try to keep your ducting in a straight line.
[02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:32.860]  Another great way to save some money on cooling, you guys, would be to run your lights at night.
[02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:38.860]  Kilowatts from the electric company are actually cheaper at night.
[02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:42.860]  So if you're not running your electricity at peak hours, it'll save you a few bucks.
[02:22:42.860 --> 02:22:47.860]  So what I would recommend, if you can do it, and this will only work for some people on your lifestyle, your schedule.
[02:22:47.860 --> 02:22:53.860]  If you can have your plants come on right around here, it gets dark about 9 o'clock, 8 or 9 o'clock-ish right now.
[02:22:53.860 --> 02:22:57.860]  It would be ideal to have your lights come on at 9 p.m.
[02:22:57.860 --> 02:23:04.860]  That way it's cool outside, the sun has gone down, the lights kick on, and that way you're not fighting the sun all day.
[02:23:04.860 --> 02:23:08.860]  You're not adding sun and grow lights to that grow room to try to cool down.
[02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:12.860]  So turn on your lights at night if you can. That'll help you out.
[02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:17.860]  All right, so you guys, straighten out your ducting, run your light cycle at night, and you'll save a few bucks on cooling costs.
[02:23:17.860 --> 02:23:22.860]  Getting your plants too hot is going to cause them to become fluffy, and it's going to decrease your harvest weight.
[02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:25.860]  So when you've got electricity bills to cover, every gram counts.
[02:23:25.860 --> 02:23:32.860]  So you've got to do your best to pull every gram you can out of the room, since you've got to pay for every kilowatt that you've used.
[02:23:32.860 --> 02:23:38.860]  So figure out how to get the ducting straight, start running your lights at night, and that will help you out quite a bit.
[02:23:38.860 --> 02:23:41.860]  Something else you guys could keep in mind during these hot summer months is humidity.
[02:23:41.860 --> 02:23:44.860]  As the temperatures rise, the humidity outside is rising also.
[02:23:44.860 --> 02:23:47.860]  So be aware of how humid your rooms are.
[02:23:47.860 --> 02:23:52.860]  This is the first year that I have personally needed to go buy a dehumidifier for my main flowering room.
[02:23:52.860 --> 02:23:55.860]  Fans and air conditioning are not enough sometimes, you guys.
[02:23:55.860 --> 02:24:01.860]  You need to remove the stagnant, humid air from your rooms and replace it with fresh, CO2-rich air for your plants.
[02:24:01.860 --> 02:24:06.860]  So you guys, make sure you're pulling that air out. That hot air needs to be sucked out.
[02:24:06.860 --> 02:24:12.860]  All right, one more thing I can think of to help you keep your rooms cool is to pay attention to the filters in your air conditioners, guys.
[02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:16.860]  Those filters are designed to last for a year without being replaced.
[02:24:16.860 --> 02:24:24.860]  But keep in mind, you guys are running them in a grow room where there may be a lot of extra dirt, a lot of humidity, and there's a lot of extra work on that unit.
[02:24:24.860 --> 02:24:30.860]  They don't expect that unit to be competing with four or five or six, whatever you got, that many thousand-watt lights.
[02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:35.860]  They don't expect that thing to come on when you buy it and never shut off like a lot of us do with an air conditioner.
[02:24:35.860 --> 02:24:38.860]  So if you've got an air conditioner that has filters, replace those.
[02:24:38.860 --> 02:24:44.860]  Once they get clogged up, the air doesn't flow through, you don't get as much cooling, you're wasting electricity.
[02:24:44.860 --> 02:24:49.860]  That electricity is not turning into a gram of weed, so you're flushing money down the toilet, basically.
[02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:54.860]  Your air conditioner may require a little extra maintenance since we're working it so hard, you guys.
[02:24:54.860 --> 02:24:56.860]  And also keep in mind where you're putting your air conditioner.
[02:24:56.860 --> 02:25:01.860]  It may suck up a little bit more dirt and shit like that just depending on where you have put it.
[02:25:01.860 --> 02:25:03.860]  All right, so that was a good little rant.
[02:25:03.860 --> 02:25:07.860]  Since we're talking about replacing things and things that you need to upgrade in your grow room,
[02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:12.860]  I figured I'd make a little kind of a checklist of things that would be a good idea to replace and check on.
[02:25:12.860 --> 02:25:16.860]  One thing that you guys need to replace is your bulbs in your grow rooms.
[02:25:16.860 --> 02:25:19.860]  The HID bulbs don't last forever.
[02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:23.860]  If you're using good bulbs, you can switch those out about once every six months,
[02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:28.860]  or if you've got the budget, you can toss them every two crops, which would be about every four months.
[02:25:28.860 --> 02:25:31.860]  That's only if you're using them only as a flowering cycle.
[02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:36.860]  If you're buying those cheap Plant Max bulbs, you guys, or whatever generic brand you're buying at your grow shop,
[02:25:36.860 --> 02:25:39.860]  I would recommend replacing those every single flowering cycle.
[02:25:39.860 --> 02:25:43.860]  Those aren't high-quality bulbs, and they burn out a little bit quickly.
[02:25:43.860 --> 02:25:47.860]  All right, if you're using those cheap bulbs, guys, what I would recommend is harvest the room, empty the room,
[02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:51.860]  clean it out, and replace those bulbs before you put new plants in there again.
[02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:55.860]  If you're using good bulbs, you can go probably two cycles, maybe three.
[02:25:55.860 --> 02:25:59.860]  I definitely wouldn't go past four flowering cycles with the same bulb.
[02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:01.860]  I would replace that.
[02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:06.860]  The bulb will stop putting out as much light, but it will still be sucking up as much electricity.
[02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:12.860]  It will still be making as much heat, and again, you're not turning those kilowatts into grams of weed, which is your goal.
[02:26:12.860 --> 02:26:17.860]  You don't want to pay for electricity that is just causing heat, which is making your air conditioner run stronger,
[02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:20.860]  which is pulling more electricity.
[02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:21.860]  You see the cycle here.
[02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:26.860]  All right, so don't forget that your bulbs in your veg area are just as important as in your flowering room, you guys.
[02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:28.860]  You've got to swap those bulbs out occasionally also.
[02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:30.860]  I like those new 315 bulbs.
[02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:32.860]  I'll re-use those at the shop.
[02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:35.860]  They seem to put out quite a bit of light, and they're affordable.
[02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:39.860]  So if you guys can afford the 315s, I would definitely recommend those.
[02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:45.860]  If you want to go with your metal halide bulbs, I would recommend those, again, every two months, every four months,
[02:26:45.860 --> 02:26:47.860]  every six months at the very longest, you guys.
[02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:51.860]  I wouldn't run longer than six months on the same bulb, no matter what you're doing with it.
[02:26:51.860 --> 02:26:55.860]  If you've got those T5 bulbs, you're going to need to replace those quite frequently.
[02:26:55.860 --> 02:26:56.860]  Those things just crap out.
[02:26:56.860 --> 02:27:01.860]  And what I've noticed about the T5s, if you buy a fixture with, like, eight T5s in it,
[02:27:01.860 --> 02:27:07.860]  just pretty much plan on replacing all eight T5 bulbs all at the same time because they're all just going to start shitting out.
[02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:09.860]  When one goes out, just go buy the whole set.
[02:27:10.860 --> 02:27:12.860]  All right, you guys, we've talked about replacing your bulbs.
[02:27:12.860 --> 02:27:14.860]  Now what about the ballasts?
[02:27:14.860 --> 02:27:18.860]  If you're using modern digital ballasts, they'll last a while.
[02:27:18.860 --> 02:27:20.860]  Most of them come with a nice warranty.
[02:27:20.860 --> 02:27:25.860]  So you didn't hear this from me, but anything that comes with a warranty that will be replaced because of the warranty,
[02:27:25.860 --> 02:27:29.860]  I make sure to break that thing about a month or two before the warranty is up,
[02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:31.860]  sometimes a few months before the warranty is up.
[02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:33.860]  Just break it. Just fucking break it.
[02:27:33.860 --> 02:27:37.860]  And then go get another one on the warranty because these companies are charging you enough for shit anyway.
[02:27:37.860 --> 02:27:38.860]  It should last a while.
[02:27:38.860 --> 02:27:39.860]  Break it and go get a new one.
[02:27:39.860 --> 02:27:41.860]  They're going to refurbish the one that you've got.
[02:27:41.860 --> 02:27:43.860]  They're going to resell it as a refurbished unit.
[02:27:43.860 --> 02:27:44.860]  Don't worry about them.
[02:27:44.860 --> 02:27:45.860]  They make plenty of money.
[02:27:45.860 --> 02:27:49.860]  Just break the fucking thing right before the warranty is up and get yourself a new one.
[02:27:49.860 --> 02:27:52.860]  If you're using those old magnetic ballasts, those things will go forever.
[02:27:53.860 --> 02:27:58.860]  You won't see any drop in light power from a ballast from what I've noticed.
[02:27:58.860 --> 02:27:59.860]  They'll just die one day.
[02:27:59.860 --> 02:28:01.860]  It won't even warn you.
[02:28:01.860 --> 02:28:05.860]  So when your ballast warranty is about to be up, go get another one, you guys.
[02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:06.860]  All right.
[02:28:06.860 --> 02:28:08.860]  That should be enough ranting for now about fixing your rooms.
[02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:13.860]  One thing I should remind you of that I have mentioned in a previous episode since we're talking about replacing things,
[02:28:13.860 --> 02:28:21.860]  calibrate your pH meters, you guys, your TDS pins, your pH pins, whatever else you want to call it, your EC meter.
[02:28:21.860 --> 02:28:27.860]  If you're in England or Britain, you guys calibrate those things quite frequently because when that messes up,
[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:31.860]  you don't even notice and you're just in there trying to adjust pH and you're doing it wrong and you don't know.
[02:28:31.860 --> 02:28:33.860]  So you're going to start causing problems.
[02:28:33.860 --> 02:28:36.860]  All right, you guys, I've been going for just over 10 minutes here.
[02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:37.860]  I need a quick dab.
[02:28:37.860 --> 02:28:40.860]  So, you know, let's do a dab on the air together.
[02:28:40.860 --> 02:28:46.860]  I was recently gifted some blueberry headband shatter from The Spot.
[02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:48.860]  It's actually the shatter is from our boys at Turpex.
[02:28:48.860 --> 02:28:50.860]  I got it at The Spot out in Pueblo West.
[02:28:50.860 --> 02:28:55.860]  I'm going to take a quick drink of this bubbly carbonated beverage I got here and then we're going to put together a dab
[02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:56.860]  and we're going to take a dab together.
[02:28:56.860 --> 02:29:02.840]  So here we go.
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:04.840]  All right, I needed a carbonated drink there.
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:06.840]  That was much deserved.
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:10.840]  I'm going to get a dab together real quick, you guys.
[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:12.840]  Big shout out to something called the Perfect Jar.
[02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:18.840]  I was gifted a jar called the Perfect Jar by my buddy Hunt of the Grimy Gatsby and they might be right.
[02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:19.840]  This might be the perfect jar, man.
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:20.840]  This thing is nice.
[02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:23.840]  It's a I don't even know what kind of plastic this is.
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:24.840]  It's real sturdy plastic.
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:25.840]  It's got a nice screw on lid.
[02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:26.840]  It's airtight.
[02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:28.840]  It's nicely it's got dividers inside.
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:30.840]  I'm able to carry my herb in one container.
[02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:35.840]  I got a dabber in one container and then like four or five different kinds of shatter and the other little containers there.
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:36.840]  Nice container, bro.
[02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:37.840]  Thanks.
[02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:38.840]  I appreciate you kicking that down.
[02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:45.840]  So today we are going to dab the what did I call it's blueberry headband from our friends at Turpex.
[02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:48.840]  And I'm putting a dab of it on the dabber right now as we speak, you guys.
[02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:54.840]  We're dabbing out of the Eric Ross 4.0 custom prototype that's autographed by Eric Ross on the back.
[02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:58.840]  It's got his little signature etched in the back to that.
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:00.840]  It's got the highly educated D-nail.
[02:30:00.840 --> 02:30:02.840]  Big shout out to highly educated and task rock.
[02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:08.840]  And that D-nail attachment is attached to what is called the G-nail coil by our friends at Emotech.
[02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:10.840]  Shout out to Giddy Up and Emotech.
[02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:11.840]  I'm burping from that drink.
[02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:12.840]  Excuse me.
[02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:13.840]  So I've got the dab together, you guys.
[02:30:13.840 --> 02:30:14.840]  Let's take a dab.
[02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:19.840]  Blueberry headband shatter from Turpex available at the spot dispensary.
[02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:23.840]  You know, by the time you hear this, they'll have a totally different brand of shatter and a totally different flavor.
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:24.840]  But let's review this anyway.
[02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:25.840]  Here we go.
[02:30:35.380 --> 02:30:36.380]  It's definitely smooth.
[02:30:36.380 --> 02:30:38.380]  Nice and smooth.
[02:30:38.380 --> 02:30:39.380]  No choke.
[02:30:41.380 --> 02:30:42.380]  Oh, I like that.
[02:30:43.380 --> 02:30:45.380]  So let me back up a step here.
[02:30:45.380 --> 02:30:47.380]  By looking at it, it's nice and glossy.
[02:30:47.380 --> 02:30:48.380]  It's got a nice shine to it.
[02:30:48.380 --> 02:30:50.380]  It's nice and clear.
[02:30:50.380 --> 02:30:52.380]  It's got a nice clear amber-yellow color.
[02:30:52.380 --> 02:30:53.380]  So it looks great.
[02:30:54.380 --> 02:30:57.380]  On the inhale, well, let me talk about the smell.
[02:30:57.380 --> 02:30:58.380]  It just smells like hash.
[02:30:58.380 --> 02:30:59.380]  Let's smell it again.
[02:30:59.380 --> 02:31:00.380]  Let's put it up to the nose.
[02:31:01.380 --> 02:31:03.380]  Yeah, it just smells, like shatter mostly smells the same.
[02:31:03.380 --> 02:31:06.380]  It's got that shatter-y, like almost a honey kind of a sweet smell to it.
[02:31:06.380 --> 02:31:08.380]  But anyway, it looks good.
[02:31:08.380 --> 02:31:09.380]  It smells good.
[02:31:09.380 --> 02:31:13.380]  When I taste it, on the inhale, I definitely tasted the blueberry.
[02:31:13.380 --> 02:31:18.380]  On the exhale, it had a hint of cushy, chemmy type of stuff.
[02:31:18.380 --> 02:31:19.380]  An earthy flavor.
[02:31:19.380 --> 02:31:20.380]  An earthy flavor on the out.
[02:31:20.380 --> 02:31:21.380]  So the in is blueberries.
[02:31:21.380 --> 02:31:24.380]  And there's a hint of blueberry on the tongue still.
[02:31:24.380 --> 02:31:25.380]  But you know what?
[02:31:25.380 --> 02:31:27.380]  The feeling is straight headband.
[02:31:27.380 --> 02:31:30.380]  It feels like I just put a headband on my head.
[02:31:30.380 --> 02:31:32.380]  It feels like I just slowed down, to tell you the truth.
[02:31:33.380 --> 02:31:35.380]  It feels like I just slowed down a whole bunch.
[02:31:35.380 --> 02:31:37.380]  So let's get back into doing a podcast.
[02:31:37.380 --> 02:31:39.380]  I certainly approve of the blueberry headband.
[02:31:39.380 --> 02:31:41.380]  It tastes like blueberry.
[02:31:41.380 --> 02:31:42.380]  It feels like headband.
[02:31:42.380 --> 02:31:43.380]  It's smooth.
[02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:45.380]  I don't know how you spoke from me, to tell you the truth, guys.
[02:31:46.380 --> 02:31:47.380]  Excuse the cough.
[02:31:47.380 --> 02:31:48.380]  Excuse the cough.
[02:31:48.380 --> 02:31:49.380]  All right.
[02:31:49.380 --> 02:31:51.380]  Now that I'm high as shit, I want to answer some questions that people have sent to me.
[02:31:51.380 --> 02:31:53.380]  These questions have come from Periscope.
[02:31:53.380 --> 02:31:54.380]  They've come from Twitter.
[02:31:54.380 --> 02:31:55.380]  I've gotten them in emails.
[02:31:55.380 --> 02:31:57.380]  And I've gotten them on Facebook.
[02:31:57.380 --> 02:32:01.380]  You guys, if you're not checking it out on Periscope, every occasionally, I jump onto Periscope.
[02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:05.380]  And I take a couple of dabs, and I rant, and I hang out with my friends.
[02:32:05.380 --> 02:32:07.380]  I talk about a few things that are on my mind.
[02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:09.380]  And then I just sign out and say goodbye.
[02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:11.380]  And I usually delete the videos pretty quickly.
[02:32:11.380 --> 02:32:14.380]  But if you ever check out the Periscope app, make sure you follow me.
[02:32:14.380 --> 02:32:16.380]  And you can check out some of the videos.
[02:32:16.380 --> 02:32:19.380]  In the future, I'll do a full podcast on Periscope.
[02:32:19.380 --> 02:32:21.380]  And you'll be able to jump in and ask me questions.
[02:32:21.380 --> 02:32:23.380]  And I'll be able to answer them live for you.
[02:32:23.380 --> 02:32:27.380]  The only problem with that right now is, you guys, I'm taking over as the lead grower at the Spot Dispensary.
[02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:29.380]  And there's been a lot of work.
[02:32:29.380 --> 02:32:31.380]  And some days we work until noon.
[02:32:31.380 --> 02:32:32.380]  Other days we work until 6.
[02:32:32.380 --> 02:32:33.380]  It's hard to guess.
[02:32:33.380 --> 02:32:36.380]  So right now, scheduling things is a little bit of a pain in the ass.
[02:32:36.380 --> 02:32:38.380]  But I promise you I'm going to do this Periscope episode.
[02:32:38.380 --> 02:32:39.380]  I just promised you.
[02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:40.380]  So that means I've got to do it.
[02:32:40.380 --> 02:32:42.380]  I've never promised you something and not done it on this show.
[02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:44.380]  All right.
[02:32:44.380 --> 02:32:45.380]  So let me get to the point here.
[02:32:45.380 --> 02:32:47.380]  Questions and answers with Rasta Jeff.
[02:32:47.380 --> 02:32:50.380]  Our first question is about a product called OGT.
[02:32:51.380 --> 02:32:55.380]  Quite a while ago, I mentioned that I use a product called OGT,
[02:32:55.380 --> 02:32:57.380]  Veganic Secret Sauce is what I think it's called.
[02:32:58.380 --> 02:32:59.380]  Somebody asked me to talk a little bit about it.
[02:33:00.380 --> 02:33:02.380]  I like that product a whole bunch.
[02:33:03.380 --> 02:33:04.380]  I like it. It's what it is.
[02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:05.380]  I don't have any of the product with me.
[02:33:05.380 --> 02:33:06.380]  I've used all of what I have.
[02:33:06.380 --> 02:33:09.380]  And I kind of haven't been using it since I ran out.
[02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:10.380]  I replaced it with something else.
[02:33:10.380 --> 02:33:16.380]  But what it is, is an organic tea that is able to be mixed almost instantly
[02:33:16.380 --> 02:33:17.380]  and then fed to your plants.
[02:33:17.380 --> 02:33:22.380]  A lot of teas that we're using need to be mixed up and they need to brew for 24 to 48 hours.
[02:33:22.380 --> 02:33:27.380]  This stuff, you can pour the powder into some water, give it a nice stir and feed it directly to your plants.
[02:33:27.380 --> 02:33:31.380]  One thing that I did notice that it promoted ridiculously healthy roots.
[02:33:31.380 --> 02:33:33.380]  My roots were growing quickly.
[02:33:33.380 --> 02:33:36.380]  My roots were growing out of the holes in the bottoms of my pots.
[02:33:36.380 --> 02:33:39.380]  The drainage holes, my roots were coming out of there looking for somewhere else to go hide.
[02:33:40.380 --> 02:33:44.380]  I have a friend who breaks down the soil from my harvested plants.
[02:33:44.380 --> 02:33:46.380]  He gets paid to help me out a little bit.
[02:33:46.380 --> 02:33:49.380]  And when Mike was breaking down those root balls, he asked me,
[02:33:49.380 --> 02:33:52.380]  Dude, what have you been doing differently lately because these things are amazing.
[02:33:52.380 --> 02:33:58.380]  A lot of that I will attribute to the secret sauce, the OGT.
[02:33:58.380 --> 02:33:59.380]  I think it was doing a lot of it.
[02:33:59.380 --> 02:34:03.380]  It was really great for the early life cycle of the plants and for veg.
[02:34:03.380 --> 02:34:08.380]  Now when I went into flower, here's something that I didn't realize was happening.
[02:34:08.380 --> 02:34:12.380]  I noticed there was something weird and somebody else pointed it out to me.
[02:34:12.380 --> 02:34:17.380]  When I was in flower and I was feeding OGT, I would feed it every other week.
[02:34:17.380 --> 02:34:24.380]  And on those weeks, I would notice that my plants would progress more into what looks like a nutrient deficiency on some strains.
[02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:29.380]  I had strains that I was feeding it just like I have before and it looked like it was becoming nitrogen deficient.
[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:33.380]  The plant couldn't keep up with itself and it was just burning out really early.
[02:34:34.380 --> 02:34:36.380]  I mentioned that to our friend, Sean.
[02:34:36.380 --> 02:34:40.380]  I mentioned that the only thing I was using differently was the OGT.
[02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:48.380]  Sean said that the rock phosphates that they are using to produce the OGT speed up the nutritive cycle of your plant.
[02:34:48.380 --> 02:34:56.380]  If you're going to use this stuff, I would only use it during the veg cycle and use it very sparingly during the flowering cycle.
[02:34:56.380 --> 02:35:03.380]  Because when I used the recommended dosage, it sped my plants up almost too much and they weren't burned.
[02:35:03.380 --> 02:35:13.380]  They were growing so quickly and using nutrients so quickly that they were eating all of their food for the week within the first couple of the days and then starving themselves.
[02:35:13.380 --> 02:35:15.380]  That's what it looked like was happening.
[02:35:15.380 --> 02:35:17.380]  That is my little rant on OGT.
[02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:20.380]  It's a good product, but if you're going to use it, be prepared.
[02:35:20.380 --> 02:35:23.380]  You're going to have to adjust your feeding and you're going to have to pay attention.
[02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:27.380]  I hope you're doing that every time you put a new product into your garden anyway.
[02:35:27.380 --> 02:35:31.380]  Our next question, I want to move on.
[02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:32.380]  Where did I put it?
[02:35:32.380 --> 02:35:33.380]  Here we go.
[02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:35.380]  Our next question comes from Periscope.
[02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:42.380]  Somebody asked me, and this is going to take me a little bit to describe here, but somebody said, what is solventless?
[02:35:42.380 --> 02:35:46.380]  Because I was talking about solventless on Periscope and they did not have it in context.
[02:35:46.380 --> 02:35:50.380]  Let me try to describe to you what solventless is.
[02:35:51.380 --> 02:35:57.380]  First off, let me say that solventless is a marketing term.
[02:35:57.380 --> 02:36:01.380]  Solventless is owned by Nick Atee of Essential Extracts.
[02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:08.380]  I don't know if it's owned by him, but it is the marketing term that he has put on what he calls solventless.
[02:36:08.380 --> 02:36:15.380]  Now, that being said, not all solventless hash has to come from Nick Atee.
[02:36:15.380 --> 02:36:20.380]  Any hash that is made without a solvent will be considered solventless.
[02:36:20.380 --> 02:36:27.380]  In most cases, in 99% of the cases in the cannabis industry, I've never seen anything else called non-solvent.
[02:36:27.380 --> 02:36:30.380]  Maybe dry sift, but that's totally different.
[02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:32.380]  Water hash or bubble hash is solventless.
[02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:34.380]  It's made with ice and water.
[02:36:34.380 --> 02:36:40.380]  The solvents that we're using is BHO, PHO.
[02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:44.380]  There are a couple other gases that people are using to extract hash with lately.
[02:36:44.380 --> 02:36:48.380]  The propane and the butane are the solvents.
[02:36:48.380 --> 02:36:51.380]  I know a lot of people are going to say, but water is a solvent as well, right?
[02:36:51.380 --> 02:36:56.380]  In this case, and I'm going to paraphrase what Nick Atee says all of the time,
[02:36:56.380 --> 02:36:58.380]  big shout out to DJ Nick Atee,
[02:36:58.380 --> 02:37:02.380]  when we're talking about solventless hash, water is not being used as a solvent.
[02:37:02.380 --> 02:37:04.380]  It's being used as a mechanical separator.
[02:37:04.380 --> 02:37:06.380]  We're not trying to dissolve the trichomes.
[02:37:06.380 --> 02:37:08.380]  We're not trying to dissolve the plant matter.
[02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:12.380]  We're just simply using it as a way to wash the trichomes off of the leaves.
[02:37:12.380 --> 02:37:17.380]  Solventless hash is basically hash made by using ice or water.
[02:37:17.380 --> 02:37:23.380]  Solventless made by DJ Nick Atee is kept at a certain temperature at all times.
[02:37:23.380 --> 02:37:26.380]  It never gets warm. It never gets dry. It never hardens up.
[02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:29.380]  It's always got a nice greasy texture to it.
[02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:32.380]  It's always real tasty. That's solventless.
[02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:36.380]  Since we're talking about solventless, let me describe a couple of other types of hash,
[02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:38.380]  just to put that in perspective a little bit.
[02:37:39.380 --> 02:37:44.380]  Other types of hash that are super popular right now that everybody talks about are BHO,
[02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:49.380]  which is butane honey oil or butane hash or dabs or shatter or wax.
[02:37:49.380 --> 02:37:52.380]  That's pretty much the most popular right now.
[02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:55.380]  Then, of course, there is live resin.
[02:37:55.380 --> 02:38:01.380]  Live resin is basically, it is BHO that is made from fresh frozen plants,
[02:38:01.380 --> 02:38:04.380]  and then it is blasted through an OB dose machine by Emotech.
[02:38:04.380 --> 02:38:08.380]  The only way that you can make live resin is through an Emotech machine.
[02:38:08.380 --> 02:38:13.380]  I know that sounds crazy, but like I said earlier, Nick Atee has made the marketing term solventless.
[02:38:13.380 --> 02:38:17.380]  The boys at Emotech have come up with the term live resin.
[02:38:17.380 --> 02:38:23.380]  Unless you're running it Emotech style in an Emotech machine, you're not making live resin.
[02:38:23.380 --> 02:38:27.380]  A lot of people are going to hate on me for that, but that is my theory and I'm sticking to it.
[02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:29.380]  All right, you guys. I've got time for one more question.
[02:38:29.380 --> 02:38:32.380]  This question comes from Facebook, and it's from our friend Bobby.
[02:38:32.380 --> 02:38:41.380]  Bobby is starting his first grow, and he's asking if it is okay to use Miracle-Gro plant food or Miracle-Gro soil for his cannabis plants.
[02:38:41.380 --> 02:38:48.380]  You guys, I definitely have to say I strongly recommend not using any Miracle-Gro products in your garden.
[02:38:48.380 --> 02:38:56.380]  The Miracle-Gro soil has time-released fertilizers in it, which will last for up to six months,
[02:38:56.380 --> 02:39:00.380]  and you don't want nitrogen being released into your plants for six months.
[02:39:01.380 --> 02:39:07.380]  I would recommend not using that soil. Use something like a Fox Farms product or a Roots Organics product.
[02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:10.380]  Do something like that if you're a new grower. It gives you a solid start.
[02:39:10.380 --> 02:39:14.380]  There's not nutrients in it that are going to screw you up.
[02:39:14.380 --> 02:39:17.380]  It'll have things in it that will help you out from the very beginning.
[02:39:17.380 --> 02:39:22.380]  As for the nutrients, if you are trying to use Miracle-Gro nutrients, I would throw those away right away.
[02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:26.380]  Get rid of the plant food. Head to your hydro shop. Head to Hygro indoor growing supplies,
[02:39:27.380 --> 02:39:30.380]  and get yourself a basic two or three part nutrient solution.
[02:39:30.380 --> 02:39:34.380]  There will be a bottle A, a bottle B of a brand that sounds good to you.
[02:39:34.380 --> 02:39:38.380]  The guys at the hydro shop can definitely talk you through what you need. They'll help you pick a brand.
[02:39:38.380 --> 02:39:42.380]  If you're just starting out, they're mainly the same thing.
[02:39:42.380 --> 02:39:48.380]  I would say go with something like Botanicare, Bio-Biz, something simple, just something with an A and a B.
[02:39:48.380 --> 02:39:54.380]  The General Organics or General Hydroponics, Flora Nova stuff, that's all fine.
[02:39:54.380 --> 02:39:58.380]  Any of that stuff you want to go for, it's pretty much all the same thing if you're starting out.
[02:39:58.380 --> 02:40:03.380]  Get yourself an A and a B, maybe a bloom booster, and then maybe some sugary or something to sweeten it up.
[02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:07.380]  Definitely get away from that Miracle-Gro stuff. Go to the hydro shop.
[02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:13.380]  Get something designed more toward cannabis, something that you can control for each cycle of your plants.
[02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:16.380]  You're not going to want the same nutrients from beginning to end.
[02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:21.380]  You want a little bit of grow in the beginning, and you're going to taper the grow off as you get into flower,
[02:40:21.380 --> 02:40:23.380]  and you'll start using the bloom solution.
[02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:28.380]  Go get something that's more designed for the plants that you are growing.
[02:40:28.380 --> 02:40:33.380]  Bobby, I hope that helps you out. You guys that are thinking about Miracle-Gro soil, I hope I got you away from that.
[02:40:33.380 --> 02:40:35.380]  Also, here's something to think about, you guys.
[02:40:35.380 --> 02:40:41.380]  Miracle-Gro products are all from Scotts, and Scotts is a Monsanto brand.
[02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:46.380]  We do not want to support Monsanto because Monsanto does not support the world.
[02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:49.380]  That's something to think about. Think about where the products you are buying are made,
[02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:53.380]  and who they affect, and the impact that you will have on the world.
[02:40:53.380 --> 02:40:56.380]  All right, you guys. I think that was enough questions for one episode.
[02:40:56.380 --> 02:40:58.380]  I really want to thank everybody who sent me questions.
[02:40:58.380 --> 02:41:03.380]  If you want to send questions to me via email, if you want to hit me up on Twitter, if you want to Facebook me,
[02:41:03.380 --> 02:41:06.380]  however you want to get a question to me, if you're one of my friends, if you're one of the homies,
[02:41:06.380 --> 02:41:09.380]  feel free to send it to me via text message.

[02:41:22.380 --> 02:41:25.380]  All right, you guys. I'll be back next week for another episode.
[02:41:25.380 --> 02:41:32.380]  I got a question from a listener asking, what are the difference, or what's the difference between THC and CBD?
[02:41:32.380 --> 02:41:36.380]  That may be the next episode. There may be one before that episode.
[02:41:36.380 --> 02:41:40.380]  That's going to be a lot of putting together. There's a lot of work going into that episode.
[02:41:40.380 --> 02:41:45.380]  I'm not sure if it'll be ready by the next one, but I will definitely have it ready by number 91.
[02:41:46.380 --> 02:41:49.380]  You guys, I'm going to wrap up the show. Thanks for listening to another episode.

[02:44:40.610 --> 02:44:41.610]  California.
[02:44:41.610 --> 02:44:43.610]  What's it like living my life?
[02:44:43.610 --> 02:44:44.610]  Rocking mics every night.
[02:44:44.610 --> 02:44:46.610]  Smoking purple and white is tight.
[02:44:46.610 --> 02:44:49.610]  I can't lie. I'm loving how I'm living since birth.
[02:44:49.610 --> 02:44:51.610]  I've been giving ambition plus the gift of spit.
[02:44:51.610 --> 02:44:52.610]  I'm hot now.
[02:44:52.610 --> 02:44:53.610]  Roller with M.I.V.
[02:44:53.610 --> 02:44:54.610]  Can't we stop now?
[02:44:54.610 --> 02:44:55.610]  See me on your plot now.
[02:44:55.610 --> 02:44:57.610]  Got it on lockdown.
[02:44:57.610 --> 02:44:59.610]  On lockdown like a penitentiary.
[02:44:59.610 --> 02:45:01.610]  Nor Cal in my lifestyle.
[02:45:01.610 --> 02:45:02.610]  You so right.
[02:45:02.610 --> 02:45:14.030]  What's it like?
[02:45:14.030 --> 02:45:15.030]  The dirt that gets around.
[02:45:15.030 --> 02:45:18.030]  Alarms going off cause I'm smoking pounds.
[02:45:18.030 --> 02:45:19.030]  Blazing all night.
[02:45:19.030 --> 02:45:20.030]  No matter the time.
[02:45:20.030 --> 02:45:21.030]  Rolling up chase.
[02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:25.460]  I'm always down.
[02:45:25.460 --> 02:45:26.460]  Naked buds.
[02:45:26.460 --> 02:45:28.460]  Rolling with care and a special touch.
[02:45:28.460 --> 02:45:29.460]  Frosty green.
[02:45:29.460 --> 02:45:31.460]  Sticky sweet.
[02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:32.460]  Good enough to eat.
[02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:35.460]  You know that I be drinking, smoking, straight waist coasting.
[02:45:35.460 --> 02:45:38.460]  Get on a microphone and I be straight Marcos.
[02:45:38.460 --> 02:45:39.460]  And I be pumping out post.
[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:40.460]  I'm thinking double dosage.
[02:45:40.460 --> 02:45:42.460]  I be writing every day to keep the pain away.
[02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:43.460]  You know what it is.
[02:45:43.460 --> 02:45:45.460]  Can you believe I get to do this?
[02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:47.460]  For a living I be sitting on top of the rhythm and channeling.
[02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:50.460]  When I'm giving out like fresh fruits and vegetables.
[02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:51.460]  Nightclubs and festivals.
[02:45:51.460 --> 02:45:53.460]  Saying smoking, sipping, let me chill and take a rest.
[02:45:53.460 --> 02:45:55.460]  Yo ma, what's it like?
[02:45:55.460 --> 02:45:57.460]  Living my life because my lifestyle.
[02:45:57.460 --> 02:45:59.460]  Lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle.

[02:46:00.460 --> 02:46:01.460]  What's it like?
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:02.460]  Living my life because my lifestyle.
[02:46:02.460 --> 02:46:04.460]  Lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle.
[02:46:04.460 --> 02:46:05.460]  Free.
[02:46:05.460 --> 02:46:07.460]  What's it like living the life that you're living?
[02:46:07.460 --> 02:46:09.460]  Are you living it up or are you just pretending?
[02:46:09.460 --> 02:46:10.460]  Just pretending.
[02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:12.460]  It's what you gotta go and ask yourself.
[02:46:12.460 --> 02:46:14.460]  Don't wanna live with regret and in this crowd for help.
[02:46:14.460 --> 02:46:15.460]  In this crowd for help.
[02:46:15.460 --> 02:46:16.460]  So come on everybody.
[02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:17.460]  What's it gonna be?
[02:46:17.460 --> 02:46:18.460]  What's it gonna be?
[02:46:18.460 --> 02:46:20.460]  It's the time to run wild and free.
[02:46:20.460 --> 02:46:21.460]  Got to do what you love.
[02:46:21.460 --> 02:46:22.460]  People can't you see?
[02:46:22.460 --> 02:46:25.460]  I'm just chilling making music that's a life for me.
[02:46:25.460 --> 02:46:26.460]  I sorta keep it classy.
[02:46:26.460 --> 02:46:27.460]  It's bad massy.
[02:46:27.460 --> 02:46:28.460]  Rocking on the strap.
[02:46:28.460 --> 02:46:30.460]  It's about to get nasty.
[02:46:30.460 --> 02:46:31.460]  Living my life right.
[02:46:31.460 --> 02:46:32.460]  Santa Cruz sunlight.
[02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:35.460]  Playing music for my soul and I'm using self control.
[02:46:35.460 --> 02:46:38.460]  Cause the message is in the music and the music is a message.
[02:46:38.460 --> 02:46:40.460]  Every day I'm living and I'm learning daily lessons.
[02:46:40.460 --> 02:46:41.460]  Don't hold back.
[02:46:41.460 --> 02:46:43.460]  Gotta tie in up the slack.
[02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:45.460]  Vibe cause you alive and you know that.
[02:46:45.460 --> 02:46:46.460]  Cause you alive.

[02:46:47.460 --> 02:46:49.460]  Living my life because my lifestyle.
[02:46:49.460 --> 02:46:50.460]  My lifestyle.

[02:47:10.460 --> 02:47:11.960]  No one can contest.
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:12.960]  Roux stain.
[02:47:12.960 --> 02:47:14.460]  Now they're talking about my style.
[02:47:14.460 --> 02:47:16.460]  I walk up to the stage and make the crowd go wild.
[02:47:16.460 --> 02:47:20.060]  I'll go wild, be famous, not weak among the nameless
[02:47:20.060 --> 02:47:22.760]  Look inside yourself and don't get trapped with all the gameless
[02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:25.060]  Global domination, mystic roots, got heat
