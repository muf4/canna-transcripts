[00:00.000 --> 00:02.320]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[00:02.320 --> 00:06.400]  It is time for episode 389 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.400 --> 00:10.440]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[00:10.440 --> 00:14.720]  Also, you may know that I've been out of town and I've been reposting old episodes that
[00:14.720 --> 00:17.860]  fall right in line with those grow lessons.
[00:17.860 --> 00:21.800]  This episode is going to be a repost, but it is a good lesson on harvesting our ripe
[00:21.800 --> 00:23.240]  cannabis plants.
[00:23.240 --> 00:27.440]  I cut out a long intro and I cut out all of the advertising, so let's jump right into
[00:27.440 --> 00:30.400]  a lesson on harvesting our ripe cannabis plants.
[00:30.400 --> 00:35.200]  All right, guys, let's do a podcast all about harvesting your cannabis.
[00:35.200 --> 00:39.560]  We've done an episode about determining when your plants are ripe.
[00:39.560 --> 00:42.620]  We've done an episode about flushing your plants before harvest.
[00:42.620 --> 00:46.200]  Now it is harvest time in the garden.
[00:46.200 --> 00:50.520]  There are a couple of things we need to think about before we go in and cut down the plants.
[00:50.520 --> 00:54.720]  First of all, I should mention, if this is your first time cutting down cannabis plants,
[00:54.720 --> 00:57.920]  you thought they smelled strongly when they were growing.
[00:57.920 --> 01:01.200]  As soon as you cut those fuckers down, it's going to double in smell.
[01:01.200 --> 01:03.300]  I know that sounds like I may be making it up.
[01:03.300 --> 01:04.640]  It sounds like I'm joking.
[01:04.640 --> 01:07.320]  No, it is going to stink.
[01:07.320 --> 01:09.680]  It's going to be ridiculous.
[01:09.680 --> 01:15.320]  If I grow one plant in a small house, we'll say in the attic or the basement, and then
[01:15.320 --> 01:21.140]  I chop that plant down and hang it up in that attic or basement, the stink of that plant,
[01:21.140 --> 01:23.860]  so normally you can smell it to the living room, right?
[01:23.860 --> 01:25.380]  To the living room of the house.
[01:25.380 --> 01:28.780]  As soon as you harvest, you can smell that shit to the driveway.
[01:28.780 --> 01:30.260]  I don't know the science behind that.
[01:30.260 --> 01:32.100]  I don't know if it's paranoia.
[01:32.100 --> 01:34.660]  I don't know if it's because we're moving in and out of the grow room more.
[01:34.660 --> 01:39.060]  I don't know exactly what it is, but as soon as you cut down that crop, it's going to stink
[01:39.060 --> 01:40.420]  more than you were expecting.
[01:40.420 --> 01:42.180]  So try to be prepared for that.
[01:42.180 --> 01:46.640]  Some things you can do to be prepared are maybe getting some Ona gels.
[01:46.640 --> 01:48.340]  If you know what Ona gels are.
[01:48.420 --> 01:53.580]  Ona gels are jars filled with this gelatinous substance that just eats up odor.
[01:53.580 --> 01:57.260]  It doesn't put out an odor, but it eats up the odors in the room.
[01:57.260 --> 01:58.900]  So you open the jar.
[01:58.900 --> 02:02.300]  I used to just set a jar of it behind a house plant or behind a picture.
[02:02.300 --> 02:05.420]  You got a picture of your daughter up on the coffee table or up on the end table.
[02:05.420 --> 02:08.900]  You just stick one of these Ona jars opened right behind it, and that just starts sucking
[02:08.900 --> 02:10.580]  up all the odor out of the room.
[02:10.580 --> 02:14.620]  So put those by the doors and the entryways of your house where people may come in, and
[02:14.620 --> 02:16.660]  that way you're sucking up that odor.
[02:16.660 --> 02:23.140]  And then also, if you can't do the Ona gels, maybe do something stronger to cover the smell.
[02:23.140 --> 02:24.140]  It's going to be hard.
[02:24.140 --> 02:28.020]  Like if you're spraying lilac air freshener, you're going to smell lilac and weed.
[02:28.020 --> 02:29.900]  The Ona gels are going to be your best bet.
[02:29.900 --> 02:33.700]  Something to neutralize the odor would be your best bet.
[02:33.700 --> 02:37.460]  Another good idea if you can afford it would be a carbon scrubber.
[02:37.460 --> 02:41.420]  Most of us have a carbon filter that blows air out of the grow room.
[02:41.420 --> 02:44.740]  Keep that running because that's going to keep filtering the air and make it smell good.
[02:44.820 --> 02:50.700]  But also, get a carbon filter with a blower on top of it and just plug it in and let that
[02:50.700 --> 02:52.260]  air run through the carbon filter.
[02:52.260 --> 02:55.980]  And now you're just sucking stink out of the air, cleaning up that environment.
[02:55.980 --> 02:57.860]  So be prepared it's going to stink.
[02:57.860 --> 02:59.260]  That is something we need to start with.
[02:59.260 --> 03:01.420]  It will be stinky.
[03:01.420 --> 03:05.420]  Now before we even start chopping down, there's a few more things to talk about.
[03:05.420 --> 03:08.580]  Where are all of these plants going to go once you cut them down?
[03:08.580 --> 03:11.740]  Let's plan this before we even get to harvest time.
[03:11.740 --> 03:14.980]  Are you going to use those circular racks that they sell at the grow store?
[03:14.980 --> 03:17.020]  The multi-tiered circle racks?
[03:17.020 --> 03:20.180]  Are you going to be able to make a line similar with string and hang them?
[03:20.180 --> 03:21.680]  That's what I prefer.
[03:21.680 --> 03:25.900]  Do you have a space that you're going to be able to control the temperature and the humidity
[03:25.900 --> 03:30.380]  and hopefully keep the aroma under control and hopefully keep light out and also keep
[03:30.380 --> 03:31.980]  people away?
[03:31.980 --> 03:36.020]  Start thinking about that around week six or seven guys.
[03:36.020 --> 03:40.100]  Let's not wait until week nine to start figuring out where these plants are going.
[03:40.100 --> 03:41.380]  Start thinking about that early.
[03:41.380 --> 03:45.180]  So you need a place for them to hang that you can control the temperature, a place you
[03:45.180 --> 03:49.700]  can control the humidity and a place you can keep people out of there.
[03:49.700 --> 03:52.300]  And also you're going to have to control that aroma.
[03:52.300 --> 03:54.560]  So have a place prepared.
[03:54.560 --> 03:58.740]  And keep in mind that if you're going to dry your buds, if these buds hang in your dingy
[03:58.740 --> 04:03.540]  funky basement, they're going to taste like funky dingy basement.
[04:03.540 --> 04:06.940]  You've tasted that smell on buds before and you probably didn't realize why does this
[04:06.940 --> 04:08.580]  taste like the damn basement?
[04:08.580 --> 04:09.580]  You know why?
[04:09.580 --> 04:14.180]  Because they've been dried and cured and hung for seven days in somebody's funky, damp,
[04:14.180 --> 04:15.500]  dirty fucking basement.
[04:15.500 --> 04:16.500]  That's exactly why.
[04:16.500 --> 04:21.060]  So have some air exchange, have some temperature control and have a good environment.
[04:21.060 --> 04:23.340]  You guys create a good environment for your plants.
[04:23.340 --> 04:24.980]  You've gotten them this far.
[04:24.980 --> 04:26.500]  Let's not ruin them.
[04:26.500 --> 04:31.260]  If you're growing in a grow hut and you don't have another crop coming up right behind it,
[04:31.260 --> 04:33.940]  why not just use that grow hut as your drying space?
[04:33.940 --> 04:35.700]  That would not be a bad idea.
[04:35.700 --> 04:37.740]  You're controlling that environment already anyway.
[04:37.740 --> 04:40.100]  So that is always an option.
[04:40.100 --> 04:41.380]  Create a good environment, you guys.
[04:41.380 --> 04:43.500]  And we'll talk more about the space in a minute.
[04:43.500 --> 04:45.220]  You can just use the grow room if you need to.
[04:45.220 --> 04:48.620]  If you don't have another crop coming up, just use your flower room or move the plants
[04:48.620 --> 04:50.420]  into flower, use the bedroom.
[04:50.420 --> 04:51.980]  That's always an option, but we'll get back to that.
[04:51.980 --> 04:53.100]  Don't worry, you guys.
[04:53.100 --> 04:57.820]  Let's talk more about the things we need to prepare for before harvest time comes.
[04:57.820 --> 04:59.900]  You're going to need a few tools.
[04:59.900 --> 05:02.740]  I highly recommend gloves.
[05:02.740 --> 05:05.460]  The black or the blue thin nitrile gloves.
[05:05.460 --> 05:06.460]  They don't have to be super thick.
[05:06.460 --> 05:08.380]  You're just trying to not get sticky.
[05:08.380 --> 05:12.420]  You guys, when you're trimming weed and when you're harvesting and handling this amount
[05:12.420 --> 05:14.300]  of weed, you're going to get sticky.
[05:14.300 --> 05:15.820]  You might want to wear long sleeves.
[05:15.820 --> 05:18.740]  You might want to wear just a long sleeve over shirt that you can take off when you're
[05:18.740 --> 05:19.740]  done.
[05:19.740 --> 05:20.820]  You're going to get sticky.
[05:20.820 --> 05:22.500]  You are going to stink.
[05:22.500 --> 05:25.660]  Some people have an allergy to cannabis.
[05:25.660 --> 05:28.900]  I've got a friend, if she rubs up against a blue dream plant, she's going to break out
[05:28.900 --> 05:30.440]  into a giant rash.
[05:30.440 --> 05:32.180]  So maybe cover yourself up.
[05:32.180 --> 05:33.500]  Certainly wear gloves.
[05:33.500 --> 05:41.340]  Also, if your eye itches, do never rub your eye with a trichome-laden finger.
[05:41.340 --> 05:44.940]  If your eye itches and you're trimming weed, take off your gloves and then itch your eye
[05:44.940 --> 05:46.620]  with a clean hand.
[05:46.620 --> 05:50.340]  Or if you've been trimming and not wearing gloves, go wash your hands before you itch
[05:50.340 --> 05:55.180]  your eye or scratch your eye because if you get resin in your eye, it is one of the most
[05:55.180 --> 05:58.880]  painful experiences you will ever endure.
[05:58.880 --> 06:00.420]  It hurts and it won't stop.
[06:00.420 --> 06:02.220]  I don't know what makes it stop.
[06:02.220 --> 06:06.100]  It just burns and burns and burns and it's sticky and when you blink, you expect it to
[06:06.100 --> 06:08.700]  feel better but it's just stickier.
[06:08.700 --> 06:10.500]  It's so fucking miserable.
[06:10.500 --> 06:14.400]  So gloves, a long sleeve shirt.
[06:14.400 --> 06:16.540]  You're also going to need some scissors.
[06:16.540 --> 06:19.020]  I recommend quality scissors.
[06:19.020 --> 06:21.740]  You can buy some cheap, shitty scissors but they're going to break.
[06:21.740 --> 06:25.740]  I also recommend using a different pair of scissors for cutting down the plants than
[06:25.740 --> 06:27.780]  you use for trimming the plants.
[06:27.780 --> 06:30.380]  When you're trimming, you're getting in there and getting the fine details.
[06:30.380 --> 06:33.980]  When you're cutting them down, you're using brute force and cutting down tough plants.
[06:33.980 --> 06:37.340]  You may need some thicker pruners.
[06:37.340 --> 06:39.900]  You may need some choppers to cut down a big plant.
[06:39.900 --> 06:43.140]  I don't know how big your stalk is but you want to be able to get in there and cut it
[06:43.140 --> 06:46.460]  down easily without hurting your wrist, without breaking your scissors.
[06:46.460 --> 06:52.140]  So I like something that has got a metal solid piece to it for cutting them down.
[06:52.140 --> 06:54.540]  Not the plastic scissors for cutting them down, metal.
[06:54.540 --> 06:57.460]  Two solid pieces of metal from the handle to the blade.
[06:57.460 --> 07:02.420]  And also for trimming, that's when I like the little fiskers, the diamond tips or something
[07:02.420 --> 07:03.420]  similar to that.
[07:03.420 --> 07:05.900]  So something to cut down the plants with.
[07:05.900 --> 07:09.660]  Scissors, shears, whatever you're going to use, be prepared.
[07:09.660 --> 07:14.300]  And if you're going to have more than one person doing the chopping down, get more than
[07:14.300 --> 07:16.020]  one fucking pair of shears.
[07:16.020 --> 07:19.460]  There's nothing more frustrating than watching people stand around and not able to do work
[07:19.460 --> 07:22.140]  because you don't have enough scissors or you don't have the right tools.
[07:22.140 --> 07:25.780]  If you're going to have a group of people doing it, get a group of shears.
[07:25.820 --> 07:27.820]  I know most of you guys probably have a small garden.
[07:27.820 --> 07:32.260]  It's probably one or two of you and you don't need giant bolt cutter style shears or giant
[07:32.260 --> 07:33.860]  fiskers shears or anything.
[07:33.860 --> 07:37.300]  But I've been in that situation before where I'm watching five guys wait for work because
[07:37.300 --> 07:40.700]  it's just me with a set of shears chopping down every plant.
[07:40.700 --> 07:45.520]  So have enough shears, have enough gloves, maybe get a few different sizes of gloves.
[07:45.520 --> 07:48.260]  If you're going to go buy a box of gloves, buy two, maybe three.
[07:48.260 --> 07:50.060]  Get small, medium and larges.
[07:50.060 --> 07:51.780]  Or maybe small, large and extra large.
[07:51.780 --> 07:53.180]  It depends on who's coming over to help you out.
[07:53.180 --> 07:55.940]  But if you're going to have people helping, if they're going to be harvesting and trimming
[07:55.940 --> 08:00.100]  with you, maybe you want a few different size gloves.
[08:00.100 --> 08:01.520]  And here's something I should mention.
[08:01.520 --> 08:04.980]  If you have applied any pesticides to your cannabis plants and you're going to cut them
[08:04.980 --> 08:08.680]  down and have other people work with them, maybe you should politely let those people
[08:08.680 --> 08:12.580]  know what pesticides were applied to your plants so that they can wear long sleeves,
[08:12.580 --> 08:17.340]  they can wear a mask, they can dress appropriately based on their decisions, based on what pesticides
[08:17.340 --> 08:18.420]  you have applied.
[08:18.420 --> 08:19.800]  Some things don't bother me.
[08:19.800 --> 08:24.160]  Some things I would want to put on some long sleeves for and not get that on my arms.
[08:24.160 --> 08:26.200]  Just personal preferences, safety.
[08:26.200 --> 08:27.480]  It's always polite anyway.
[08:27.480 --> 08:32.120]  So the next thing we should talk about is how are we going to hang these plants?
[08:32.120 --> 08:35.280]  Because the next thing you got to buy is something to hang them on.
[08:35.280 --> 08:36.280]  Are you going to use...
[08:36.280 --> 08:39.120]  So the grow store sells this really nice hanger.
[08:39.120 --> 08:41.920]  It's about three feet around and it hangs in the middle.
[08:41.920 --> 08:45.680]  And then it's got four or five shelves on it that you can just fill with buds.
[08:45.680 --> 08:48.960]  That's acceptable if you want to cut your buds into small pieces or your branches into
[08:48.960 --> 08:51.360]  small pieces and hang it on there.
[08:51.360 --> 08:54.800]  That's just fine, but that's not the way I would prefer to do it.
[08:54.800 --> 08:58.520]  I prefer to hang the branches so that the buds aren't touching anything so that they
[08:58.520 --> 09:02.680]  don't get a flat spot, so that there's not a spot where air can't flow around it.
[09:02.680 --> 09:04.600]  I just prefer to hang them.
[09:04.600 --> 09:06.800]  So in Colorado, we're allowed to grow six plants.
[09:06.800 --> 09:08.680]  Let's say we've got a six plant harvest.
[09:08.680 --> 09:12.760]  I would get six coat hangers or clothes hangers, and then I would get some fishing line or
[09:12.760 --> 09:17.380]  some thick hemp twine, and I would anchor that to two opposite ends of the room.
[09:17.380 --> 09:20.340]  So I've just got a nice piece of string hanging across the room.
[09:20.340 --> 09:25.060]  Now you can hang the plants on that string if you want to, but if you're using multiple
[09:25.060 --> 09:30.260]  strains, maybe you've got six different plants, maybe you've got giant plants, that's when
[09:30.260 --> 09:34.100]  you can cut the plant into smaller pieces and put it on the coat hanger, and you can
[09:34.100 --> 09:38.060]  label the coat hanger, this is all sour tangy, this one is all black cherry.
[09:38.060 --> 09:41.440]  That way you don't have one long line of buds that get confused.
[09:41.440 --> 09:43.480]  Also it makes more space.
[09:43.480 --> 09:46.320]  Another thing you're going to need is some sort of labels.
[09:46.320 --> 09:48.200]  You might want to get just some white duct tape.
[09:48.200 --> 09:51.400]  You can always just peel off a piece of duct tape, write on that, stick it wherever you
[09:51.400 --> 09:55.320]  want it, or you can get some real labels, or you can improvise however you need to,
[09:55.320 --> 09:58.920]  but you're going to want labels if you've got more than one strain.
[09:58.920 --> 10:01.980]  There's nothing worse than getting shit confused right at the end.
[10:01.980 --> 10:03.360]  That's really frustrating.
[10:03.360 --> 10:07.240]  So you've got some way to control the odor.
[10:07.240 --> 10:12.320]  You've got a place thought of and prepared where you can control the temperature, the
[10:12.320 --> 10:16.760]  humidity, the lights, the airflow, the aroma, and the security.
[10:16.760 --> 10:19.420]  You've got that all prepared, and you've got the proper tools.
[10:19.420 --> 10:20.520]  You've got gloves.
[10:20.520 --> 10:22.320]  You've got something to cut it down with.
[10:22.320 --> 10:24.360]  You've got something to hang it on.
[10:24.360 --> 10:27.200]  Now let's talk about the room just a little bit.
[10:27.200 --> 10:33.280]  You're going to need, I would recommend, a humidifier and a dehumidifier, and also some
[10:33.280 --> 10:36.240]  sort of exhaust fan to get the stale air out of the room.
[10:36.240 --> 10:39.600]  If it's a small space, you could probably just crack the door open, but if you've got
[10:39.600 --> 10:41.920]  a lot of plants in there, you're going to need to exchange some air.
[10:41.920 --> 10:46.080]  You're going to need to get that humid air out of there, or the plants will never dry.
[10:46.080 --> 10:48.160]  They'll just get stagnant and funky.
[10:48.160 --> 10:51.100]  Also I may recommend a small fan.
[10:51.100 --> 10:55.160]  You don't want air blowing directly onto the buds, but you want to move that air around.
[10:55.160 --> 10:57.400]  You just don't want it stagnant and funky in there.
[10:57.400 --> 10:59.760]  You really want to be able to control the climate.
[10:59.760 --> 11:03.120]  Also you're going to need something to tell you what's going on in there.
[11:03.120 --> 11:08.520]  A thermometer, a hygrometer, perhaps a PL grow unit.
[11:08.520 --> 11:12.320]  You want something in there so you know what the temperature is and what the humidity is
[11:12.320 --> 11:14.960]  so you can adjust accordingly.
[11:14.960 --> 11:19.120]  Now it feels like we've talked a lot about what to buy and how to prepare, so let's talk
[11:19.120 --> 11:23.080]  a little bit about the settings in the room since we're talking about all this equipment.
[11:23.080 --> 11:28.560]  I like to put a humidifier and a dehumidifier in the room, and I set them both at 50%.
[11:28.560 --> 11:32.180]  That way I know that that room is staying right around 50%.
[11:32.180 --> 11:36.720]  If you can set them up to something like a PL grow unit, or if you can set them up to
[11:36.720 --> 11:41.280]  something that will trigger them to go off and on based on certain parameters, put them
[11:41.280 --> 11:43.000]  both at 50%.
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.760]  Have the dehumidifier work to 50%, have that humidifier work to 50%, and keep that room
[11:48.760 --> 11:53.160]  at 50% humidity as consistently as possible.
[11:53.160 --> 11:56.800]  Now it may be a good idea to have some sort of exhaust fan in the room.
[11:56.800 --> 11:59.540]  Nothing major, just maybe a little four inch exhaustor.
[11:59.540 --> 12:03.240]  If you can do it, if you can just suck the air out of that room occasionally, that would
[12:03.240 --> 12:04.240]  help you out.
[12:04.240 --> 12:06.720]  You can get that old, stagnant, funky air out of there.
[12:06.720 --> 12:11.600]  If that is not an option, open the door, put a fan by the door, just make sure that air
[12:11.600 --> 12:15.240]  exchanges occasionally so you don't get old air in there.
[12:15.240 --> 12:19.960]  Now inside this room where you've got your dehumidifier, your humidifier, and some air
[12:19.960 --> 12:24.800]  exhaust, try to keep it somewhere around 70 degrees in that room.
[12:24.800 --> 12:27.480]  65 to 75 degrees will be ideal.
[12:27.480 --> 12:30.880]  Any hotter, you're going to speed up the drying, it's also going to get funky, it's going to
[12:30.880 --> 12:32.260]  increase humidity.
[12:32.260 --> 12:38.100]  Any cooler, the room will start getting too dry and your buds will get crispy too quickly.
[12:38.100 --> 12:40.900]  So you've got your temperature, you've got your humidity under control, you've got some
[12:40.900 --> 12:46.020]  air exchange, let's put a small fan in the room, perhaps on the floor just to keep the
[12:46.020 --> 12:48.540]  air moving around, or up high in the room.
[12:48.540 --> 12:52.020]  You don't want it right in the middle blowing on the plants too much.
[12:52.020 --> 12:55.780]  That's going to create a dry spot and just dry out some of those buds too quickly.
[12:55.780 --> 12:58.460]  We just want to move the air around so it doesn't get stale.
[12:58.460 --> 13:02.220]  I usually get one of those fans that would sit on your computer desk, just a desk fan,
[13:02.220 --> 13:06.060]  it's a little tiny, like a 12 or 14 inch fan, put that in the corner on the floor.
[13:06.060 --> 13:07.820]  If you've got a small room, that is plenty.
[13:07.820 --> 13:09.060]  Just move the air around.
[13:09.060 --> 13:13.980]  All right, so that sounds like we've got a pretty good idea of a dry and cure space.
[13:13.980 --> 13:19.020]  Basically a small room or a grow tent that you can control the environment in and you
[13:19.020 --> 13:22.860]  can hang those plants in safely, securely, and in the dark.
[13:22.860 --> 13:25.380]  If you need to use a small closet, you can do that.
[13:25.380 --> 13:29.580]  Just make sure that door gets opened and those buds don't get stale in there.
[13:29.900 --> 13:33.380]  Also, like I mentioned earlier, if you don't have sufficient drying space, go ahead and
[13:33.380 --> 13:37.460]  use the flowering room that you flowered the buds in, or maybe move your next round of
[13:37.460 --> 13:41.260]  plants from the bedroom into that flower and use your bedroom.
[13:41.260 --> 13:44.340]  Grow tents always make nice dry and cure areas.
[13:44.340 --> 13:48.740]  If you're growing in a five by five tent, you could easily dry your whole harvest in
[13:48.740 --> 13:50.940]  maybe a three by three tent.
[13:50.940 --> 13:52.260]  That wouldn't be a problem at all.
[13:52.260 --> 13:55.660]  You don't need that much room to dry your harvest.
[13:55.660 --> 13:56.660]  Well, hopefully you do.
[13:56.980 --> 14:00.020]  Hopefully you need a 10 by 10, but that's not going to be logical.
[14:00.020 --> 14:01.700]  All right, now we know what to buy.
[14:01.700 --> 14:03.460]  We know what supplies we're going to need.
[14:03.460 --> 14:06.380]  We've got a safe space set up for our plants.
[14:06.380 --> 14:09.860]  Hopefully you've been flushing your plants for 10 to 14 days.
[14:09.860 --> 14:12.940]  There's one more thing we should do before we get to chopping these plants.
[14:12.940 --> 14:16.980]  While they are still standing up, we should go and take off all of the big leaves.
[14:16.980 --> 14:20.620]  Any leaf that you can break off with your hand now, just go ahead and take it off.
[14:20.620 --> 14:22.340]  The plants don't need leaves.
[14:22.340 --> 14:23.580]  You're about to harvest them.
[14:23.580 --> 14:26.820]  You can do this seven, five, three days before harvest.
[14:26.820 --> 14:29.140]  You could do it right up before the moment you harvest.
[14:29.140 --> 14:31.340]  Just start taking off all those big leaves.
[14:31.340 --> 14:33.100]  Those leaves are unnecessary.
[14:33.100 --> 14:35.180]  I like to just go in and throw them right on the floor.
[14:35.180 --> 14:37.620]  Just start tearing leaves off and throw them right on the floor and sweep up when you're
[14:37.620 --> 14:39.740]  done because there's going to be a lot of them.
[14:39.740 --> 14:41.900]  Just tear off all of the leaves you can get.
[14:41.900 --> 14:42.940]  You don't need those.
[14:42.940 --> 14:46.340]  This is going to save you time when it comes harvest time.
[14:46.340 --> 14:48.900]  We're going to cut these plants down and let them dry.
[14:48.900 --> 14:53.060]  All those long leaves are just going to dry on there and be in the way and smell funky
[14:53.060 --> 14:56.140]  and they're a sticky bitch to work through once they dry.
[14:56.140 --> 14:57.700]  They're much easier to get off now.
[14:57.700 --> 14:59.740]  Just snap them right off of there.
[14:59.740 --> 15:04.460]  De-leaf this shit out of the entire room before you cut down any of the plants.
[15:04.460 --> 15:09.340]  Once they are all pre-defoliated, that's what I call it, the pre-harvest defoliation, then
[15:09.340 --> 15:12.460]  it is time to start chopping down these plants.
[15:12.460 --> 15:17.580]  I don't know how big your plants are, but this is basically how I chop down a plant.
[15:17.580 --> 15:20.220]  I kneel down or if it's on a table, whatever, I walk to it.
[15:20.380 --> 15:24.340]  I usually kneel down to one knee and I grab the plant right above where I'm going to cut.
[15:24.340 --> 15:27.140]  I've got the stalk just a couple inches above the dirt.
[15:27.140 --> 15:30.940]  I get my loppers or whatever you want to call them, your pruners, your shears, and get in
[15:30.940 --> 15:34.140]  there and cut right above the dirt, right below my hand, chop.
[15:34.140 --> 15:35.540]  Now it's going to fall over.
[15:35.540 --> 15:36.780]  It's going to timber on me.
[15:36.780 --> 15:38.580]  If I got a little plant, no problem.
[15:38.580 --> 15:41.020]  If I'm in a three or five gallon pot, I got this by myself.
[15:41.020 --> 15:43.940]  If I've got a bigger plant, I will ask somebody to help me.
[15:43.940 --> 15:46.820]  Hey dude, hold the top of this because when I cut it, it's going to fucking timber down
[15:46.820 --> 15:47.820]  on us.
[15:48.620 --> 15:51.700]  I would get in there and cut it right at the base.
[15:51.700 --> 15:57.300]  If you have got maybe a tomato cage or some trellising or something like that, maybe figure
[15:57.300 --> 16:00.340]  out how to get the plant out of there by cutting from the top down.
[16:00.340 --> 16:04.780]  I like to cut the whole plant out in one piece and hang the whole thing upside down and let
[16:04.780 --> 16:07.260]  it all dry in one piece.
[16:07.260 --> 16:08.820]  That's the way I like to do it.
[16:08.820 --> 16:13.180]  If you've put the plant in a screen of green or a tomato cage, you may have to start at
[16:13.180 --> 16:16.340]  the top and cut out individual branches.
[16:16.340 --> 16:17.820]  That is just fine.
[16:17.820 --> 16:23.060]  Make sure that you keep each branch of each strain together so that you don't mix anything
[16:23.060 --> 16:24.060]  up.
[16:24.060 --> 16:26.020]  I mentioned earlier how frustrating that shit is.
[16:26.020 --> 16:28.100]  Don't mix stuff up.
[16:28.100 --> 16:29.100]  Separate your plant.
[16:29.100 --> 16:30.780]  Free your plant from its tomato cage.
[16:30.780 --> 16:33.300]  Free the plant from the trellis however you need to.
[16:33.300 --> 16:34.300]  Then chop it down.
[16:34.300 --> 16:38.980]  Now, if you've got the whole plant chopped down in one piece, just get a ... I get a
[16:38.980 --> 16:40.500]  fuzzy stick is what they're called.
[16:40.500 --> 16:44.780]  They sell them at Hobby Lobby or you can use the twisty ties that come with your trash
[16:44.780 --> 16:47.460]  bags because I never use the twisty ties in the trash bags anyway.
[16:47.460 --> 16:49.220]  They always end up for this purpose.
[16:49.220 --> 16:51.620]  Wrap the twisty tie around the base of the plant.
[16:51.620 --> 16:52.980]  Do it securely.
[16:52.980 --> 16:55.740]  Put a branch in there because it may slide off.
[16:55.740 --> 17:00.340]  Then tie that to either your coat hanger or the line that you're going to hang it from.
[17:00.340 --> 17:03.900]  If you've got the line hanging across the room, attach it to that securely.
[17:03.900 --> 17:07.280]  Hang it on there in a way that you know it's not going to fall.
[17:07.280 --> 17:12.980]  If you've got to cut it down into branches, try to cut to where you create little V-shaped
[17:12.980 --> 17:13.980]  intersections.
[17:13.980 --> 17:17.460]  If you hang the plant upside down, you'll see the little wishbone shaped intersections
[17:17.460 --> 17:22.700]  that you can use perfectly to hang your branches on your coat hanger or on your line.
[17:22.700 --> 17:27.500]  Cut the plant, flip it upside down, and just hang it in the size of sections that you need
[17:27.500 --> 17:28.500]  to.
[17:28.500 --> 17:29.500]  Here's some advice.
[17:29.500 --> 17:33.820]  If you have to cut your plant down into smaller sections to make it fit, make the sections
[17:33.820 --> 17:35.900]  similar sizes.
[17:35.900 --> 17:38.220]  That way they dry at similar speeds.
[17:38.220 --> 17:41.700]  If you've got one big piece and one little piece, that big piece is going to take longer
[17:41.700 --> 17:42.700]  to dry than the little piece.
[17:42.700 --> 17:46.500]  It's going to cause unevenness and you're going to be confused on what to do.
[17:46.500 --> 17:47.500]  Chop everything.
[17:47.500 --> 17:49.900]  If you're going to chop it, let it all hang in one big piece if you're going to let it
[17:49.900 --> 17:52.340]  hang in one big piece.
[17:52.340 --> 17:54.860]  Cut the plant at the base or pull out the branches.
[17:54.860 --> 17:59.020]  Hang them on the coat hanger either by using the twisty ties and securing it to the coat
[17:59.020 --> 18:03.660]  hanger there or just by using the V-shaped intersections and hanging it like a little
[18:03.660 --> 18:05.940]  hook on the V-shaped intersection.
[18:05.940 --> 18:09.220]  Get everything hanging safely in your dry and cure room.
[18:09.220 --> 18:11.660]  Chop everything down and just go hang it all up.
[18:11.660 --> 18:14.180]  You're going to be super excited now.
[18:14.180 --> 18:17.180]  You're going to want to go post to all your social media about how you just took down
[18:17.180 --> 18:20.220]  your first harvest, but do not do that.
[18:20.220 --> 18:22.180]  Here is some old school advice.
[18:22.180 --> 18:26.780]  Don't post any pictures or talk about your harvest until it's gone.
[18:26.780 --> 18:31.360]  If it's going out for retail, if it's going into your jar, into your safe, that's when
[18:31.360 --> 18:32.800]  you talk about it.
[18:32.800 --> 18:35.500]  Don't talk about it while that shit is hanging in a room.
[18:35.500 --> 18:37.500]  Don't talk about it while you're trimming it.
[18:37.500 --> 18:39.020]  Don't talk about it yet.
[18:39.020 --> 18:40.020]  Just wait.
[18:40.020 --> 18:41.020]  Okay?
[18:41.380 --> 18:46.380]  Just wait because right now it's hanging in a room and when you go to Walmart and you
[18:46.380 --> 18:50.140]  post that to Facebook also, someone's going in your back fucking door and getting all
[18:50.140 --> 18:53.820]  your weed and they're going to trim it for you and you're never going to see any of it.
[18:53.820 --> 18:55.540]  So don't post yet.
[18:55.540 --> 18:56.540]  Hold off.
[18:56.540 --> 18:57.540]  Just wait.
[18:57.540 --> 19:02.340]  Now if you're chopping down multiple strains, carefully, carefully, carefully label these
[19:02.340 --> 19:03.340]  plants.
[19:03.340 --> 19:04.340]  You're going to...
[19:04.340 --> 19:05.340]  So I'll go back.
[19:05.340 --> 19:06.340]  I'll recap a little bit because I feel like I went fast.
[19:06.340 --> 19:07.980]  Grab it right above the dirt, chop it down.
[19:07.980 --> 19:10.460]  It's going to flip upside down.
[19:10.460 --> 19:11.780]  Flip it upside down.
[19:11.780 --> 19:14.700]  Either put one branch over your line that you're going to hang it on and let it hang
[19:14.700 --> 19:15.700]  right there.
[19:15.700 --> 19:16.700]  Put a label on it.
[19:16.700 --> 19:18.580]  Or put it on a coat hanger.
[19:18.580 --> 19:21.340]  Just slide the one branch through the coat hanger to where it's got one arm through and
[19:21.340 --> 19:22.340]  then it's just hanging.
[19:22.340 --> 19:25.960]  Put it on the coat hanger or cut it into smaller pieces and do it that way.
[19:25.960 --> 19:29.160]  Label the coat hanger what strain you've got.
[19:29.160 --> 19:30.260]  So cut it down.
[19:30.260 --> 19:31.340]  Hang it up.
[19:31.340 --> 19:32.440]  Label it.
[19:32.440 --> 19:37.620]  It's going to hang there for somewhere between five and 14, maybe a couple more days.
[19:37.620 --> 19:41.980]  I haven't seen them go more than 14 days in Colorado, but if you're on the coast where
[19:41.980 --> 19:44.540]  you've got humidity, you may get some more time.
[19:44.540 --> 19:45.740]  So you've chopped them down.
[19:45.740 --> 19:46.960]  They're hanging upside down.
[19:46.960 --> 19:48.660]  You've got them labeled.
[19:48.660 --> 19:52.820]  You've got the lights, temperature, humidity, and airflow all controlled in your room.
[19:52.820 --> 19:57.220]  Now you're just going to have to wait somewhere between five and 14 days for those sticks
[19:57.220 --> 19:58.780]  to start snapping.
[19:58.780 --> 20:02.780]  When you bend them, you just want them to go crunch.
[20:02.780 --> 20:04.300]  You don't want them to explode.
[20:04.300 --> 20:07.100]  You don't want them to just crumble up like a whole bag of Doritos.
[20:07.100 --> 20:08.380]  You just want them to snap.
[20:08.380 --> 20:10.100]  You don't want a bunch of moisture in there.
[20:10.100 --> 20:12.140]  And check a few of them before you get excited.
[20:12.140 --> 20:17.700]  But when they start snapping consistently, that is when the dry phase has ended and it
[20:17.700 --> 20:21.100]  is time to work yourself into the cure phase.
[20:21.100 --> 20:22.100]  All right.
[20:22.100 --> 20:25.640]  Now, I did skip the part about putting them on the dry racks that I talked about you could
[20:25.640 --> 20:27.020]  get from the grocery store.
[20:27.020 --> 20:28.860]  The grocery store sells these dry racks.
[20:28.860 --> 20:30.540]  They look like a 22-inch kick drum head.
[20:30.540 --> 20:33.340]  I think they're about 24 inches around.
[20:33.340 --> 20:36.420]  They're meshy and they're kind of cheap, but they work really well.
[20:36.420 --> 20:37.420]  You just hang it up.
[20:37.420 --> 20:43.980]  And for this, I would probably take the buds off of the sticks and just put just the buds
[20:43.980 --> 20:45.820]  into those racks.
[20:45.820 --> 20:47.660]  I wouldn't put the sticks in there.
[20:47.660 --> 20:50.660]  I feel like the sticks are going to take up a lot of space in there and they also get
[20:50.660 --> 20:53.620]  stuck in the fucking netting a whole lot and they're a pain in the ass.
[20:53.620 --> 20:58.460]  I would cut every single bud off of the stick, if it were me, and I would lay the buds in
[20:58.460 --> 21:01.020]  there and I would spread them out kind of far.
[21:01.020 --> 21:04.500]  And then every morning when I wake up, I would go in there and just move those buds around
[21:04.620 --> 21:06.780]  and kind of shuffle them around a little bit.
[21:06.780 --> 21:10.900]  That's not the ideal way to do it, but I understand that some of us are limited on space.
[21:10.900 --> 21:14.300]  If that's what you've got to do, that's what you have got to do.
[21:14.300 --> 21:18.260]  I would rather see you hang them until they dry and get a little drier and as soon as
[21:18.260 --> 21:21.460]  the stick snaps, then get it off the stick.
[21:21.460 --> 21:25.180]  But I understand that sometimes you've got to improvise.
[21:25.180 --> 21:29.020]  That's part of being a good grower, being able to adjust, adapt, and improvise with
[21:29.020 --> 21:31.060]  what you've got when you've got it.
[21:31.060 --> 21:33.020]  People are so fucking spoiled now.
[21:33.020 --> 21:38.420]  You've got these giant facilities with parking lots and security cameras and loading bays
[21:38.420 --> 21:40.020]  and friends.
[21:40.020 --> 21:42.100]  When I first started doing this, you couldn't talk about it.
[21:42.100 --> 21:45.140]  You couldn't have your friends help you carry your grow shit into the house because now
[21:45.140 --> 21:48.380]  they know you're growing and they're going to want something or they're going to fucking
[21:48.380 --> 21:49.380]  steal it.
[21:49.380 --> 21:52.540]  And if you need more space, you just call a contractor and you get a building permit and
[21:52.540 --> 21:55.580]  you just build out another room and you've got a drying cure area.
[21:55.580 --> 21:57.140]  Back in the day, we couldn't do that.
[21:57.140 --> 21:59.180]  You would catch people drying their fucking weed in the bathroom.
[21:59.180 --> 22:00.900]  Hey man, I got to piss while I'm at your house.
[22:00.900 --> 22:02.020]  No bro, you can't pee here.
[22:02.020 --> 22:03.180]  What man, I just got to pee.
[22:03.180 --> 22:04.180]  No bro, you can't pee.
[22:04.180 --> 22:07.980]  And then you catch on later that he was drying and curing his fucking weed in the bathroom.
[22:07.980 --> 22:10.140]  Anyway, I got rambly there.
[22:10.140 --> 22:12.100]  Those dry racks are cool if that's what you got to do.
[22:12.100 --> 22:13.940]  Of course, I would prefer to hang it.
[22:13.940 --> 22:15.700]  I'd prefer to hang it whole plant.
[22:15.700 --> 22:18.140]  I'd prefer to hang it until it starts snapping.
[22:18.140 --> 22:20.860]  Like I said, that's when we enter the cure phase.
[22:20.860 --> 22:25.100]  Now, if you didn't have time or the forethought to start defoliating your plants before you
[22:25.100 --> 22:29.020]  harvested, don't be afraid to go in there and take off all the excess leaves while they're
[22:29.020 --> 22:30.020]  hanging upside down.
[22:30.020 --> 22:31.460]  It is never too late to do that.
[22:31.460 --> 22:34.780]  All right, you guys, I feel like I can recrap.
[22:34.780 --> 22:36.460]  Let's recrap what I said.
[22:36.460 --> 22:38.420]  Probably a recap would be better for a podcast.
[22:38.420 --> 22:39.420]  Let's recap a little bit.
[22:39.420 --> 22:40.860]  You need the appropriate tools.
[22:40.860 --> 22:42.140]  You need the appropriate equipment.
[22:42.140 --> 22:43.140]  You need a good room.
[22:43.140 --> 22:46.100]  You need to be able to control the temperature and humidity.
[22:46.100 --> 22:47.600]  You don't want people getting in there.
[22:47.600 --> 22:49.460]  You need to control the aroma.
[22:49.460 --> 22:50.660]  You're going to need some gloves.
[22:50.660 --> 22:54.380]  You're going to need something to hang your plants on, and you're going to need some sort
[22:54.380 --> 22:57.940]  of labels if you're growing more than one string.
[22:57.940 --> 23:01.780]  It's a good idea to start pre-defoliating if you can get in there and take off the leaves
[23:01.780 --> 23:02.780]  before.
[23:02.780 --> 23:04.860]  The chop down process is fairly simple.
[23:04.860 --> 23:08.820]  Grab it, chop it, hang that motherfucker upside down, and let it start drying.
[23:08.820 --> 23:11.900]  We know what temperature and humidity we need to keep the dry in cure room.
[23:11.900 --> 23:15.420]  We want about 50%, about 70 degrees.
[23:15.420 --> 23:18.900]  Let those plants hang for four or five days and start snapping the stems and see if they
[23:18.900 --> 23:19.900]  pop.
[23:19.900 --> 23:24.500]  It'll be five, seven, 10, maybe 14 days before they're ready to go into containers.
[23:24.500 --> 23:25.780]  That's when we're going to jar them up.
[23:25.780 --> 23:27.740]  That's where we're going to put them into containers.
[23:27.740 --> 23:29.700]  That's when the cure process is going to start.
[23:29.700 --> 23:34.260]  I think we've got a good grasp on how to harvest our plants.
[23:34.260 --> 23:38.500]  The next step in harvesting, you guys, is to get in there and clean and reset the grow
[23:38.500 --> 23:39.500]  room.
[23:39.500 --> 23:40.500]  That's right.
[23:40.500 --> 23:41.500]  It may be time to buy new bulbs.
[23:41.500 --> 23:44.220]  It may be time to change your air conditioner filters.
[23:44.220 --> 23:47.980]  It is certainly time to clean the cover on your carbon filter.
[23:47.980 --> 23:50.340]  Also maybe get in there and scrub the lenses.
[23:50.340 --> 23:54.780]  If you've got glass lenses on your ducted hoods, it's a good time to get in there and
[23:54.780 --> 23:56.100]  scrub that shit out.
[23:56.100 --> 23:58.340]  Make sure that everything is nice and clean.
[23:58.340 --> 24:02.660]  Clean the room with a cleaning product, maybe some bleach, maybe some Fizan, whatever you've
[24:02.660 --> 24:03.660]  got.
[24:03.660 --> 24:06.060]  Get in there and clean the shit out of the grow room.
[24:06.060 --> 24:07.820]  Get in the corners.
[24:07.820 --> 24:09.900]  Get in all the spots you've been missing.
[24:09.900 --> 24:14.140]  If you plan on using your grow room or your grow hut as your drying space, that's a good
[24:14.140 --> 24:17.340]  excuse but you're going to have to clean it as soon as you're done with that.
[24:17.340 --> 24:20.600]  As soon as those plants come out of there and you're trimming, you should take a break
[24:20.600 --> 24:25.180]  and go clean the shit out of your grow space before you put more plants in there.
[24:25.260 --> 24:27.980]  That is the completion of your harvest.
[24:27.980 --> 24:31.860]  That is also the completion of your harvest lesson, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:31.860 --> 24:32.940]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[24:32.940 --> 24:36.980]  I think the next episode, I have a guest scheduled.
[24:36.980 --> 24:41.140]  So there will be another episode before the dry and cure episode but there is an in-depth
[24:41.140 --> 24:43.380]  dry and cure episode coming up.
[24:43.380 --> 24:45.860]  We'll also talk about trimming a little bit.
[24:45.860 --> 24:49.380]  And then I think we're going to continue with grow lessons and we're going to start over.
[24:49.380 --> 24:54.380]  We're going to go right into germinating seeds and cutting clones and getting a grow started
[24:54.380 --> 24:55.380]  all over again.
[24:55.380 --> 24:58.660]  I've got a lot of fun things planned out for the podcast.
[24:58.660 --> 24:59.660]  Please stick around you guys.
[24:59.660 --> 25:03.020]  I think you will enjoy what I have planned for everybody.
[25:03.020 --> 25:04.300]  You guys, I want to give some shout outs.
[25:04.300 --> 25:08.460]  Let's give a huge shout out to my friend Melanie Alexander and also a gigantic shout out to
[25:08.460 --> 25:09.460]  Aaron Johnson.

[25:22.060 --> 25:23.060]  properly.
[25:23.060 --> 25:24.060]  That's huge help.
[25:24.740 --> 25:25.740]  And also everybody who tells me, I don't know, it's broken.
[25:25.740 --> 25:26.740]  I can't fix it.
[25:26.740 --> 25:27.740]  So thanks for reaching out.
