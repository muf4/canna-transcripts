[00:17.340 --> 00:20.100]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:20.100 --> 00:23.700]  It is time for episode number 123 of the grow from your heart podcast,
[00:24.020 --> 00:27.140]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.660 --> 00:29.860]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.060 --> 00:32.060]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:32.460 --> 00:35.300]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:35.300 --> 00:40.020]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host.
[00:40.060 --> 00:42.780]  My friends call me Ross DeGeff. I want to thank you once again for joining me.
[00:43.260 --> 00:43.900]  As always,
[00:43.900 --> 00:46.940]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band
[00:46.940 --> 00:50.060]  for letting me use their music on my show. Big shout out to Kat,
[00:50.420 --> 00:52.460]  Coop and the entire mystic roots crew.
[00:53.820 --> 00:55.860]  I want to dedicate this episode to my friend, Zach.
[00:55.900 --> 00:59.420]  We lost his act to cystic fibrosis this month. So fuck you.
[00:59.420 --> 01:02.140]  Cystic fibrosis and Zach, I miss you. And I love you brother.
[01:02.420 --> 01:03.380]  This dab is for you.
[01:03.540 --> 01:06.300]  I'm going to take a little dab because Zach had cystic fibrosis and it messed
[01:06.300 --> 01:09.340]  with his lungs really badly. Uh, if he took too big of a dab,
[01:09.340 --> 01:12.260]  he would sound just like the bong. So we're going to take a little dab for him.
[01:12.260 --> 01:14.380]  We're going to breathe in some love. We're going to blow out some bullshit.
[01:14.620 --> 01:28.240]  This dab is for you brother Zach. Everybody dab with me. All right.
[01:28.240 --> 01:30.920]  That was a big, nice dab. Zach, I'm going to miss you brother.
[01:30.920 --> 01:34.800]  It's not going to be the same. Uh, yeah. Much love, much respect.
[01:34.960 --> 01:36.680]  Shout out to Tim. Also, if you're listening to him,
[01:36.680 --> 01:40.000]  I hope we get together sometime soon and celebrate Zach. All right.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.120]  So ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for joining me.
[01:42.280 --> 01:45.120]  This episode will come mostly from the Cana Canyon.
[01:45.120 --> 01:48.800]  The Cana Canyon is my favorite cannabis social lounge in Colorado Springs where
[01:48.800 --> 01:53.160]  we are allowed to congregate and socialize and smoke recreational cannabis like
[01:53.360 --> 01:57.040]  a responsible adult should be allowed to. So, uh, before I get to that,
[01:57.720 --> 02:00.280]  I want to talk about something I've been seeing on Facebook.
[02:00.760 --> 02:04.840]  The Cannabis Cup for Colorado has been canceled for the year 2016.
[02:04.840 --> 02:07.440]  There will be no Cannabis Cup over the 420 weekend.
[02:07.960 --> 02:12.200]  High Times intended to have the event in Denver, Colorado. Uh, Adams County,
[02:12.200 --> 02:15.960]  I believe it was rejected all of the permits and would not let High Times have
[02:15.960 --> 02:16.800]  their event.
[02:16.840 --> 02:20.160]  High Times had to scramble to find a new location for the Cannabis Cup.
[02:20.680 --> 02:25.400]  They opted to try Pueblo. They put in applications for permits.
[02:26.160 --> 02:29.960]  They decided through that process that there would not be enough time to
[02:29.960 --> 02:33.520]  advertise and organize a Cannabis Cup should the event be approved.
[02:34.280 --> 02:37.920]  So what I've seen a lot on Facebook is people bitching out High Times and people
[02:37.920 --> 02:42.000]  bitching out the city of Pueblo and people bitching out the city of Denver for a
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.680]  Cannabis Cup not happening. Hey guys, this was a huge event.
[02:46.040 --> 02:48.240]  There's a lot of risk involved. Um,
[02:48.920 --> 02:52.280]  we can't blame any city for an event not happening. Maybe Denver,
[02:52.640 --> 02:55.520]  they did a kick High Times out. They did not approve the permit.
[02:55.800 --> 02:58.800]  So maybe we can be mad at them, but it is not High Times' fault,
[02:58.800 --> 03:02.720]  nor is it Pueblo's fault that this event did not happen in the backup plan of
[03:02.720 --> 03:04.120]  Pueblo. Uh,
[03:04.360 --> 03:08.680]  High Times submitted the permits and the High Times also pulled the permits.
[03:08.680 --> 03:11.040]  They decided, or the applications for permits,
[03:11.360 --> 03:13.400]  they decided to stop the process.
[03:13.840 --> 03:16.160]  So there wasn't enough time to get an event together,
[03:16.160 --> 03:19.840]  even if Pueblo did approve it. So High Times just decided to pull the plug.
[03:19.840 --> 03:22.280]  We can't blame it on anybody. Let's quit pointing fingers.
[03:22.280 --> 03:25.280]  Let's all be friends again. Let's get back together. Let's dab like we used to.
[03:25.280 --> 03:28.840]  Let's be a community. Uh, that's what I have to say about that. Uh,
[03:28.840 --> 03:32.400]  we will talk a little bit about this in the episode when my friends join me. Uh,
[03:32.440 --> 03:36.400]  since there is no Cannabis Cup, you guys, let me invite you to the secret sesh.
[03:36.560 --> 03:38.480]  The secret sesh is hosted by Gatsby Gardens.
[03:38.480 --> 03:39.960]  We will have a ton of great sponsors.
[03:40.200 --> 03:42.920]  Our friend Adam Ill is coming from California to host the event.
[03:43.240 --> 03:45.600]  I will be there. The Grimy Gatsby will be there.
[03:45.840 --> 03:48.680]  Our friend Duditz Damsel will be there. There will be a lot of people there,
[03:48.920 --> 03:53.120]  dabbing, vending, having a grand four 20 time. I hope you can join us.
[03:54.080 --> 03:57.440]  Follow secret sesh Colorado on Instagram for more information.
[03:57.760 --> 04:02.040]  As soon as I have more info, I will get it to you. You guys,
[04:02.040 --> 04:05.440]  I talked about doing an episode about what you could do if you came to Pueblo
[04:05.440 --> 04:06.280]  for the Cannabis Cup.
[04:06.800 --> 04:09.960]  Obviously there's no point in doing that because you're not going to come here
[04:09.960 --> 04:13.280]  because there's not a Cannabis Cup. So I apologize for teasing you about that.
[04:13.640 --> 04:16.160]  If there's something you'd like to know about the city of Pueblo, Colorado,
[04:16.440 --> 04:19.320]  send me an email, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[04:19.600 --> 04:22.280]  I will answer the email and we'll talk about Pueblo.
[04:22.320 --> 04:23.800]  A lot of people are talking about moving here.
[04:24.400 --> 04:26.840]  There's some things that you should know and things you probably didn't think
[04:26.840 --> 04:29.200]  of. We'll talk about those. All right, you guys,
[04:29.200 --> 04:31.000]  I think it is time for us to time warp.
[04:31.520 --> 04:34.400]  We're going to travel back in time to just a couple of days ago when I met with
[04:34.400 --> 04:38.480]  my friend Camille with Steven DeFino, who else was there? Kabuki J Fox.
[04:38.480 --> 04:39.480]  And my new friend, Matt,
[04:39.480 --> 04:44.080]  we all gathered at the Canna Canyon on 1507 Colorado Boulevard,
[04:44.080 --> 04:48.400]  I think Boulevard, 1507 Colorado in Colorado Springs. It's a great place.
[04:48.560 --> 04:49.640]  So we're going to time warp.
[04:49.800 --> 04:52.640]  I'm going to put on some music and we are going to journey back in time.
[04:52.640 --> 04:54.360]  And when we get back, we will be at the Canna Canyon.
[05:08.100 --> 05:11.700]  All right, podcast world. We are here at the Canna Canyon in Colorado Springs.
[05:11.700 --> 05:14.180]  Camille, will you remind me the address please? Cause I'm high as shit.
[05:14.260 --> 05:17.780]  1507 West Colorado Avenue.
[05:17.780 --> 05:21.180]  Thank you so much. So come down to 1507 West Colorado Avenue.
[05:21.180 --> 05:24.260]  Check out the Canna Canyon. It's a great place. The couches are comfy.
[05:24.740 --> 05:27.900]  The tables are covered in rigs and they've got an email. Come hit it.
[05:27.900 --> 05:30.300]  So guys, welcome to the show. Sitting to my left,
[05:30.340 --> 05:33.180]  a little further to my left is our good friend Camille. Thank you for joining me.
[05:33.380 --> 05:35.020]  You're welcome. Thanks for having me.
[05:35.380 --> 05:36.860]  Thanks for coming. You got such a great smile.
[05:37.380 --> 05:39.140]  I'm happy to be here. It's a good day.
[05:39.220 --> 05:40.060]  You look great today.
[05:40.300 --> 05:43.380]  Sitting to my immediate left over here is our good friend, Steven DeFino.
[05:43.380 --> 05:46.260]  You are the president and founder of the Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[05:46.260 --> 05:46.780]  Is that correct?
[05:46.780 --> 05:47.460]  That is correct.
[05:47.460 --> 05:49.340]  Thanks for doing that. Thanks for being on the show.
[05:49.340 --> 05:50.660]  Thanks. Glad to be here.
[05:50.660 --> 05:51.460]  Dude, thanks for coming.
[05:51.460 --> 05:55.260]  Over here to my kind of far to the right is our buddy Kabuki J Fox.
[05:55.260 --> 05:55.940]  How you doing, bro?
[05:55.940 --> 05:57.780]  Hey, I'm awesome, man. Thanks for having me back.
[05:57.780 --> 05:59.260]  You are awesome as shit. Thanks for joining me.
[05:59.260 --> 05:59.980]  I appreciate it.
[05:59.980 --> 06:01.700]  Hashtag run CBD. All day.
[06:01.700 --> 06:03.980]  Hashtag Terps for Tots.
[06:03.980 --> 06:05.500]  Yes. All right.
[06:05.500 --> 06:07.900]  So sitting to my right is kind of a new friend.
[06:07.900 --> 06:09.220]  Remind me your name, my friend.
[06:09.220 --> 06:11.820]  Matthew Kale. Matthew Kale.
[06:11.820 --> 06:14.460]  Yes, I'm with an outfit here.
[06:15.260 --> 06:16.500]  Veterans for natural rights.
[06:16.500 --> 06:19.860]  I'm I'm one of the individuals that that helps
[06:20.660 --> 06:23.180]  out with the event the other night at the Dab Lounge.
[06:23.300 --> 06:24.540]  And thank you for doing that.
[06:24.540 --> 06:25.340]  Yeah, thanks for doing that.
[06:25.340 --> 06:27.780]  We're going to talk a lot about that before we get to that.
[06:27.900 --> 06:29.180]  So thanks for joining me, everybody.
[06:29.180 --> 06:31.340]  Before we get to that, and let me put a disclaimer out there.
[06:31.340 --> 06:33.180]  Camille is working at the Canyon.
[06:33.180 --> 06:33.980]  She is the host.
[06:33.980 --> 06:35.620]  And are you the owner here? Is that correct?
[06:35.620 --> 06:37.340]  I am co-owner owner.
[06:37.340 --> 06:40.860]  So she may have to stand up and take off and go for a run any given moment here.
[06:41.100 --> 06:43.100]  So excuse her if that happens.
[06:43.100 --> 06:46.740]  We'll try to get some of her stuff covered in the beginning of the show here.
[06:46.900 --> 06:48.700]  So one thing I want to talk about with everybody,
[06:48.700 --> 06:53.460]  the Cannabis Cup for Colorado has officially been canceled.
[06:53.460 --> 06:55.980]  What? What? What? What?
[06:55.980 --> 06:57.820]  I know. Yeah, we're all stoked about that.
[06:57.820 --> 06:59.820]  I'm sure everybody here had an idea of something
[06:59.820 --> 07:02.060]  they wanted to do for 420 and for the Cannabis Cup.
[07:02.100 --> 07:04.260]  Absolutely. Yeah.
[07:04.260 --> 07:07.260]  On the flip side, I will say I am fairly excited.
[07:07.260 --> 07:12.220]  I think that this is going to be kind of the turn of 420
[07:12.220 --> 07:14.980]  being about private events.
[07:14.980 --> 07:16.060]  I'm kind of excited about that.
[07:16.060 --> 07:19.340]  I know the Secret Sesh is happening up in Denver.
[07:19.340 --> 07:21.020]  That's going to be awesome.
[07:21.020 --> 07:22.460]  Yeah. Yeah.
[07:22.460 --> 07:23.980]  We're planning on doing something as well.
[07:23.980 --> 07:28.340]  I can't talk too much about what we're planning on doing, but I'm excited.
[07:28.340 --> 07:33.740]  I think this is kind of a new wave of a different 420.
[07:33.740 --> 07:35.060]  I think it's going to be cool.
[07:35.060 --> 07:37.980]  I like the way that you put that, because that kind of works me into part
[07:37.980 --> 07:41.820]  of what I wanted to talk about, the importance of consumption clubs.
[07:41.980 --> 07:44.540]  Since they're not going to let us have large events like that,
[07:44.540 --> 07:48.980]  we need to have places like the Canna Canyon to consume our cannabis
[07:48.980 --> 07:52.420]  for people to come and socialize like we're all we're doing is hanging out
[07:52.420 --> 07:54.260]  and consuming cannabis and being friends here.
[07:54.260 --> 07:54.860]  Absolutely.
[07:54.860 --> 07:57.900]  Surely that we definitely need something like this.
[07:58.700 --> 08:02.580]  So before I get to that, let's talk about the Veteran Farmers Alliance
[08:02.580 --> 08:04.140]  event that happened a couple of days ago.
[08:04.140 --> 08:06.100]  I want to give you a huge shout out, Stephen.
[08:06.100 --> 08:07.540]  That was a huge event.
[08:07.540 --> 08:08.980]  How many people do you think showed up?
[08:08.980 --> 08:10.260]  It was awesome.
[08:10.300 --> 08:11.100]  Oh, let's see.
[08:12.300 --> 08:15.220]  I'd say we think probably a little over 200.
[08:15.380 --> 08:17.380]  Oh, I think it was a little more than that.
[08:17.380 --> 08:19.700]  I guess over the course of the day.
[08:19.700 --> 08:20.060]  Right.
[08:20.060 --> 08:21.020]  Throughout the course of the day.
[08:21.020 --> 08:21.540]  Easy.
[08:21.540 --> 08:22.980]  Like 10 to seven.
[08:22.980 --> 08:26.140]  And we were there from like, you know, we didn't leave to like 11 or 10 that night.
[08:26.140 --> 08:26.820]  So yeah.
[08:26.820 --> 08:30.100]  So Stephen hosted an event at the Dab Lounge in Colorado Springs.
[08:30.100 --> 08:32.540]  It's another social smoke lounge.
[08:32.540 --> 08:33.620]  Shout out to the Dab Lounge.
[08:33.620 --> 08:35.700]  And thank you, Dan, for letting us host that event.
[08:35.700 --> 08:36.180]  Absolutely.
[08:36.180 --> 08:36.780]  Dan Goodman.
[08:36.780 --> 08:37.300]  Super nice.
[08:37.300 --> 08:37.620]  There you go.
[08:37.620 --> 08:38.820]  Shout out to that dude.
[08:38.820 --> 08:41.700]  So Stephen hosted an event there called the Veteran Farmers.
[08:41.700 --> 08:44.780]  Was that an official title or was it just the Veteran Farmers Alliance?
[08:44.780 --> 08:48.300]  Get together, party, smoke out, sesh, have a good time.
[08:48.420 --> 08:49.340]  All right.
[08:49.340 --> 08:51.660]  Can you tell us a little bit about the Veteran Farmers Alliance?
[08:51.700 --> 08:52.540]  Absolutely.
[08:52.540 --> 08:55.580]  Basically, the Veteran Farmers Alliance brings the community together,
[08:55.940 --> 08:59.420]  brings veterans together with civilians, brings breeders together,
[08:59.420 --> 09:05.260]  growers together, nutrient manufacturers and just glass blowers.
[09:06.260 --> 09:09.580]  It just takes everybody and brings them all in one place
[09:10.180 --> 09:15.620]  and allows these guys to have free genetics, free information, education,
[09:16.300 --> 09:19.620]  all that, and they're able to get in one centralized location
[09:20.500 --> 09:23.700]  to where they can have good medicine,
[09:24.020 --> 09:25.860]  they can get the best medicine that's out there.
[09:25.860 --> 09:27.900]  It's not this watered down crap.
[09:27.900 --> 09:30.820]  You know, these are fresh genetics, good genetics, and these guys care.
[09:31.420 --> 09:34.220]  So we had 300 people came through this event
[09:34.660 --> 09:35.900]  inside of the dab lounge.
[09:35.900 --> 09:37.700]  We had breeders set up with their boots.
[09:37.700 --> 09:38.780]  They had seeds available.
[09:38.780 --> 09:40.620]  We had nutrient companies.
[09:40.620 --> 09:41.900]  We had glass companies.
[09:41.900 --> 09:46.420]  And all of these companies threw down stacks of merchandise for the veterans.
[09:46.540 --> 09:47.540]  Absolutely. They did.
[09:47.540 --> 09:51.060]  And I asked about what the value of the prizes you gave away was that
[09:51.260 --> 09:52.420]  that day without being rude?
[09:52.420 --> 09:57.220]  Well, the total the total value was just a little over twelve thousand dollars.
[09:57.220 --> 09:59.940]  Twelve thousand dollars with the products given to veterans
[10:00.140 --> 10:03.860]  to help them grow better cannabis, to fight their PTSD, their pain,
[10:03.900 --> 10:05.500]  their depression, their anxiety.
[10:05.500 --> 10:06.220]  Absolutely. Awesome.
[10:06.220 --> 10:07.380]  Did I want to give you a fist bump?
[10:07.380 --> 10:08.180]  Thank you for doing that.
[10:08.180 --> 10:08.820]  Yeah, no problem.
[10:08.820 --> 10:10.980]  That event is hugely respectable.
[10:11.460 --> 10:12.780]  And also thanks to these guys to the right.
[10:12.780 --> 10:14.100]  They all showed up and dabbed with me.
[10:14.100 --> 10:15.540]  I got to hang out. No problem.
[10:15.540 --> 10:16.820]  Thanks to the run CBD hoodie.
[10:16.820 --> 10:18.340]  Sharp on me. Anytime, dude.
[10:18.340 --> 10:20.220]  Yeah, it did. You look good in purple, man.
[10:20.220 --> 10:21.620]  You look good in the picture, bro.
[10:21.620 --> 10:23.300]  Check us out on Instagram, you guys.
[10:23.300 --> 10:26.260]  All right. So we were in Colorado Springs tonight, you guys.
[10:26.260 --> 10:28.700]  And last night there was a city council meeting.
[10:28.700 --> 10:30.980]  Everybody's facial expressions all just changed.
[10:30.980 --> 10:33.180]  Everyone's body language just deflated a little.
[10:33.780 --> 10:36.700]  At this city council meeting, a lot of things went down.
[10:36.900 --> 10:38.940]  I live in another city. I was trying to keep up.
[10:39.220 --> 10:43.460]  What I understand is they have put a moratorium on more social clubs like this.
[10:43.660 --> 10:47.180]  And in eight years, are all clubs like this forced to close? Yes.
[10:48.580 --> 10:52.500]  Yes. So the moratorium was actually set in place back in September.
[10:53.060 --> 10:55.300]  Six months, the moratorium set.
[10:55.300 --> 11:01.060]  So we are we are re-approaching, you know, that six month mark of the moratorium.
[11:01.060 --> 11:04.940]  And so I think they're just trying to establish what they want to do with that.
[11:04.940 --> 11:09.260]  And what they decided was they wanted to ban them
[11:09.420 --> 11:14.300]  originally supposed to be for five years, but they extended it to eight years.
[11:15.580 --> 11:17.100]  Kind of a blow.
[11:17.100 --> 11:20.940]  But at the same time, this is what the voters wanted.
[11:20.940 --> 11:23.220]  We're very passionate about that.
[11:23.220 --> 11:24.340]  That's what we believe in.
[11:24.340 --> 11:26.900]  And that's what we're going to fight for.
[11:26.900 --> 11:29.860]  So this isn't the end. This is just the beginning.
[11:30.020 --> 11:31.900]  OK. Yeah. Your faith in that.
[11:31.900 --> 11:35.500]  Yeah. The way that it's written, does that mean that in eight years you have to close?
[11:36.220 --> 11:41.060]  Yes. In eight years, by March twenty twenty four, we will have to close our doors.
[11:41.100 --> 11:44.020]  And is there a second vote coming to?
[11:44.340 --> 11:48.700]  Right. So there's another vote on March twenty second, the second round of votes.
[11:49.940 --> 11:52.740]  But, you know, a lot can happen in eight years.
[11:53.140 --> 11:55.420]  Marijuana can become federally legal.
[11:56.740 --> 11:59.060]  You know, the opposite direction as well.
[11:59.980 --> 12:01.180]  My mom.
[12:01.180 --> 12:03.420]  That's true. I'm like, oh, yeah, yeah.
[12:03.460 --> 12:06.180]  Well, you know, I think we have to be real.
[12:06.460 --> 12:09.220]  I mean, it could happen.
[12:09.860 --> 12:13.940]  So it least gives us a little bit of time
[12:13.940 --> 12:17.700]  to get a ballot referendum to allow these kind of clubs.
[12:18.020 --> 12:23.060]  And it gives us a little bit of time to force legislation on the issue
[12:23.580 --> 12:26.900]  because Jonathan Singer himself and also
[12:27.740 --> 12:31.420]  the representative Kit Rupp from Colorado Springs himself.
[12:31.620 --> 12:36.740]  He's backing a bill to legalize these types of clubs statewide.
[12:37.020 --> 12:42.940]  So these are already we already know that there is a lot of support here
[12:42.940 --> 12:44.180]  in Colorado Springs.
[12:44.180 --> 12:46.740]  Otherwise, otherwise, Kit Rupp wouldn't be on board.
[12:46.820 --> 12:52.300]  Absolutely. So I think another thing that really spoke volumes about that as well
[12:52.300 --> 12:56.420]  was the amount of people that showed up for that initial meeting
[12:56.420 --> 13:00.180]  on like February twenty second, twenty fourth.
[13:00.220 --> 13:03.140]  Yeah, I mean, a standing room only.
[13:03.140 --> 13:08.060]  And I think I think there was only like two people out of like
[13:08.420 --> 13:11.180]  120 plus that were against these clubs.
[13:11.180 --> 13:15.260]  And the majority of those people there were very much so for them, about them.
[13:15.260 --> 13:18.180]  And so that was very frustrating.
[13:18.180 --> 13:20.540]  But the community has spoken.
[13:20.540 --> 13:24.380]  So I saw the I watched part of the meeting on the Internet the other day
[13:24.380 --> 13:26.260]  and the place was packed once again.
[13:26.260 --> 13:27.500]  We got passionate this time.
[13:27.500 --> 13:29.980]  We got to see our friend from the Lazy Lion.
[13:29.980 --> 13:31.780]  To the ears off the city. Oh, no.
[13:31.780 --> 13:32.540]  Yeah, it's kind of neat.
[13:32.540 --> 13:34.340]  That was awesome. Remind me that guy's name.
[13:34.340 --> 13:35.180]  Andrew. Yeah.
[13:35.180 --> 13:36.740]  Shout out to Andrew. I like you.
[13:36.740 --> 13:39.060]  Those are some very well spoken words there.
[13:39.340 --> 13:40.740]  Way to put that one out there.
[13:40.740 --> 13:42.300]  See, someone had to.
[13:42.300 --> 13:43.380]  Yeah, someone's got to do it.
[13:43.380 --> 13:45.340]  And I'm glad that he chose to. And he's a veteran also.
[13:45.340 --> 13:46.940]  So shout out to the veterans.
[13:46.940 --> 13:49.180]  That's cool that he came and supported, supported the community.
[13:49.180 --> 13:51.580]  The vast majority of people there were veterans.
[13:51.580 --> 13:54.380]  How about the two city council members? Was it?
[13:54.380 --> 13:57.180]  OK, yeah. Stephen, grab the microphone.
[13:57.180 --> 14:01.220]  OK, so I went to resolve and I asked,
[14:01.780 --> 14:04.380]  I asked the city council members, I said, how many of your veterans?
[14:04.380 --> 14:06.580]  I said, just by showing his show me.
[14:06.580 --> 14:09.060]  None of not one of them raised their hands.
[14:09.060 --> 14:11.020]  They wouldn't acknowledge that they were veterans.
[14:11.020 --> 14:12.140]  That's disrespectful.
[14:12.140 --> 14:13.300]  Absolutely. That's disrespectful.
[14:13.300 --> 14:14.700]  And they are veterans to the other.
[14:14.700 --> 14:17.340]  They are absolutely disrespectful to their service.
[14:17.340 --> 14:20.020]  I'm sure that when they go other places, they get a veterans discount.
[14:20.380 --> 14:21.620]  Of course. Sure.
[14:21.620 --> 14:22.820]  Do I get a better? Yes.
[14:22.820 --> 14:24.700]  Yeah. Well, they raise their hand then.
[14:24.700 --> 14:25.900]  Yeah, probably. Absolutely.
[14:25.900 --> 14:27.820]  You know, they didn't raise their hands.
[14:27.820 --> 14:31.020]  So I asked, I turned around and said, how many veterans are behind me?
[14:31.380 --> 14:34.340]  And like three quarters of the room raised their hands.
[14:34.340 --> 14:36.820]  Veterans were veterans, medical marijuana patients.
[14:36.980 --> 14:39.380]  You know, they these guys don't understand.
[14:39.660 --> 14:41.660]  This is a cry for help.
[14:41.660 --> 14:44.780]  And all those guys that raise their hands, all those guys and girls
[14:44.780 --> 14:49.140]  will have to say that they raise their hands and it's like they didn't care.
[14:50.060 --> 14:50.780]  They don't care.
[14:50.780 --> 14:52.780]  It was an emotional cry for help, too.
[14:52.780 --> 14:55.180]  There were people breaking down on the stand,
[14:55.580 --> 14:58.260]  talking about the importance of these clubs and the importance
[14:58.260 --> 15:01.100]  of these gathering places because they can't go anywhere else.
[15:01.100 --> 15:05.260]  They have lease agreements that prevent them from smoking in their own homes.
[15:05.780 --> 15:09.020]  These are people who serve their country and they're not allowed to take part
[15:09.020 --> 15:11.820]  in the freedoms that they're guaranteed by the Constitution
[15:11.980 --> 15:13.060]  of the state they live in.
[15:14.060 --> 15:15.100]  It's a travesty.
[15:15.100 --> 15:17.180]  We could almost just in the show right there.
[15:17.180 --> 15:19.780]  That was that's yeah, that's exactly what's going on.
[15:20.060 --> 15:22.060]  So let's talk a little bit about the importance of these clubs.
[15:22.060 --> 15:22.900]  You got something to say. Go for it.
[15:22.900 --> 15:25.860]  Yeah, I was just going to say and not to mention, shout out to the dab launch
[15:25.860 --> 15:30.540]  for providing an awesome space for those veterans to have the Veterans
[15:30.540 --> 15:31.740]  Farmers Alliance event.
[15:31.740 --> 15:33.980]  I mean, if it wasn't for these social clubs,
[15:34.460 --> 15:38.300]  that community wouldn't be able to be brought together as easily.
[15:38.300 --> 15:41.100]  So I gave veterans dabs for their first time.
[15:41.740 --> 15:42.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:42.980 --> 15:43.580]  It's awesome.
[15:43.580 --> 15:45.700]  People have never dabbed before in Kabuki.
[15:45.940 --> 15:47.140]  You can't run CBD.
[15:47.140 --> 15:49.100]  Sure. And people want to know everything about.
[15:49.140 --> 15:51.020]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[15:51.020 --> 15:51.780]  And it's awesome.
[15:51.780 --> 15:53.820]  And even through that event, that was a.
[15:53.820 --> 15:55.020]  Oh, yeah, they are. They're great.
[15:55.020 --> 15:56.540]  So that was a veterans event.
[15:56.540 --> 16:00.420]  I met four sets of parents that had special needs children
[16:00.420 --> 16:03.100]  that were curious about cannabis and curious about CBD.
[16:03.100 --> 16:06.300]  And it's funny that places like this bring
[16:06.820 --> 16:10.380]  all sorts of patients throughout the spectrum together in some way or another.
[16:10.380 --> 16:14.180]  And we help each other, even if it's just lending an ear and understanding
[16:14.180 --> 16:17.180]  or being available and being, you know, introduced to someone
[16:17.180 --> 16:19.140]  and networking with someone that can help us.
[16:19.140 --> 16:21.300]  These clubs are absolutely essential to
[16:22.460 --> 16:26.580]  anyone who really is seeking a healthy social outlet in our community
[16:26.820 --> 16:30.780]  to not only discuss cannabis, but why it works for them.
[16:30.780 --> 16:34.060]  And, you know, I really can't see anything healthier.
[16:34.060 --> 16:37.820]  You know, it saddens me to see it go the way that it has.
[16:37.820 --> 16:43.220]  And, you know, I'm happy to help fight it in any way possible, because it's
[16:44.300 --> 16:45.500]  not it's bullshit.
[16:45.500 --> 16:48.140]  I mean, I can't think of any other word.
[16:48.140 --> 16:49.260]  It just makes me sad.
[16:49.260 --> 16:54.540]  Honestly, working here also, I mean, we see all types of members as well.
[16:54.540 --> 16:56.020]  And one thing that really
[16:57.660 --> 16:59.740]  kind of stands out to me is the amount of questions
[16:59.740 --> 17:02.220]  that people have that they're scared to ask.
[17:02.300 --> 17:07.300]  Yeah. Whether it's about CBD or THC or the benefits or edibles
[17:07.300 --> 17:09.620]  or proper dosing or anything like that.
[17:09.620 --> 17:13.580]  Talking about growing information that they might not get in a dispensary.
[17:13.580 --> 17:14.340]  Sorry to cut you off.
[17:14.340 --> 17:14.900]  Oh, go ahead, man.
[17:14.900 --> 17:17.620]  No, no, that was just adding on that point like that.
[17:17.660 --> 17:20.180]  We were having a conversation as friends at the front counter
[17:20.180 --> 17:22.780]  just a few minutes ago, just smoking dabs, talking about growing.
[17:22.940 --> 17:26.460]  And the folks behind us were learning everything we were saying.
[17:26.540 --> 17:28.300]  And we were absorbing that as one of that.
[17:28.300 --> 17:31.180]  One of those people in that group was learning from us on accident.
[17:31.220 --> 17:32.020]  Oh, no, definitely.
[17:32.020 --> 17:35.900]  Education and support they get just from showing up here is crucial.
[17:35.900 --> 17:36.500]  It's awesome.
[17:36.500 --> 17:39.940]  Yeah. We can go to a bar and drink alcohol until we die.
[17:40.220 --> 17:42.900]  You can physically drink enough alcohol at the bar.
[17:43.060 --> 17:43.940]  There's one bottle.
[17:43.940 --> 17:47.060]  If you drink that whole bottle of whatever you choose, it will kill you.
[17:48.020 --> 17:51.580]  You can come here and no one's going to let you smoke enough cannabis
[17:51.580 --> 17:52.420]  to hurt yourself.
[17:52.420 --> 17:55.900]  And I don't think you can smoke enough cannabis to hurt yourself.
[17:56.220 --> 17:59.100]  I will say that you could probably get high, do some dumb shit.
[17:59.300 --> 18:00.660]  And I can argue that.
[18:00.660 --> 18:03.900]  But yeah, I mean, no one's going to let anybody that's that high leave here.
[18:03.900 --> 18:04.940]  We all have each other's backs.
[18:04.940 --> 18:06.220]  We look out for each other.
[18:06.220 --> 18:07.740]  I've never seen anybody get in and out.
[18:07.740 --> 18:11.420]  This is and that's what's different about bars and these consumption clubs.
[18:11.420 --> 18:15.580]  I think that that's one of the points that I brought up in the testimony
[18:15.580 --> 18:18.660]  the other day was, you know, we may have had what?
[18:18.660 --> 18:23.780]  300 combat veterans packed into a club.
[18:24.060 --> 18:27.300]  We could not have done that in an establishment serving alcohol
[18:27.300 --> 18:28.620]  and had a peaceful night.
[18:28.620 --> 18:30.220]  It would not have happened.
[18:30.220 --> 18:32.820]  No, I. Yeah, it was packed.
[18:33.260 --> 18:36.580]  I have I have a past with alcohol and we don't get along very well.
[18:36.580 --> 18:38.460]  So if it were at a place that served alcohol,
[18:38.460 --> 18:41.100]  there's way less likely of a chance that I would have gone.
[18:41.700 --> 18:44.020]  Yeah. And a lot of these guys, it's the same way.
[18:44.220 --> 18:47.220]  You know, these these veterans, especially, you know, they
[18:47.620 --> 18:50.380]  they've self-medicated with alcohol before in their lives.
[18:50.580 --> 18:52.260]  They've self-medicated with pills.
[18:52.260 --> 18:53.940]  All these things are harmful to them.
[18:53.940 --> 18:55.220]  They they hurt them.
[18:55.220 --> 18:56.860]  They hurt them, their their families.
[18:56.860 --> 18:58.100]  They hurt their their friends.
[18:58.100 --> 18:59.340]  Their liver, their kidneys.
[18:59.340 --> 19:00.900]  Yeah, they hurt their own bodies.
[19:00.900 --> 19:04.380]  But but this it doesn't it brings them back into society.
[19:04.380 --> 19:06.340]  It brings them back into this community
[19:06.340 --> 19:08.820]  that we can sit there and help each other
[19:09.020 --> 19:11.580]  and take care of one another like we should.
[19:11.580 --> 19:13.220]  I like the way you put things, my friend.
[19:13.220 --> 19:15.580]  I'm glad we got to become friends and hang out.
[19:15.580 --> 19:17.460]  This guy's real good with the words there.
[19:17.460 --> 19:21.140]  I think the first time I met everybody in this group, the first time.
[19:21.140 --> 19:22.820]  Oh, Kabuki, I met you at a cannabis cup.
[19:22.820 --> 19:25.780]  You gave me some of that delicious banana.
[19:25.780 --> 19:28.500]  Yeah. But these two jobs, the first time I met them,
[19:28.500 --> 19:30.660]  Steve and I met here at the Canna Canyon.
[19:30.660 --> 19:32.860]  And I've met you at the event last weekend.
[19:32.900 --> 19:33.900]  Yes, indeed. Yeah.
[19:33.900 --> 19:36.540]  Without the social clubs, I wouldn't be making all these friends that I've got.
[19:36.820 --> 19:37.340]  Absolutely.
[19:37.340 --> 19:40.060]  I mean, neither of this little educational support group that we've got.
[19:40.260 --> 19:41.780]  This is what's so important, folks.
[19:41.780 --> 19:44.860]  Like at my event, there was guys that haven't come out
[19:46.140 --> 19:47.740]  of isolation over a year.
[19:47.740 --> 19:51.300]  They came out, they medicated and they were stacked deep,
[19:52.300 --> 19:56.780]  you know, 50, almost 55 people at times in that little club.
[19:56.780 --> 19:58.420]  And that little nobody freaked out.
[19:59.140 --> 20:01.140]  Everybody was under good medication.
[20:01.140 --> 20:04.300]  The PTSD guys, you could see they were ready to leave.
[20:04.420 --> 20:05.700]  Right. You know what?
[20:05.700 --> 20:07.900]  You know, some of them stayed the entire night, though.
[20:07.940 --> 20:09.420]  Yeah, absolutely.
[20:09.420 --> 20:10.780]  They stayed the entire night.
[20:10.780 --> 20:14.460]  People that I know for a fact have severe problems with crowds.
[20:14.700 --> 20:18.300]  They were there the entire night and they they they were dedicated to it.
[20:18.300 --> 20:21.100]  They they love the fact that we were having that event,
[20:21.100 --> 20:23.940]  that so many other people around them had their back.
[20:23.940 --> 20:27.020]  They're giving out free food all night, which I thought was super awesome.
[20:27.260 --> 20:29.660]  All day, all night, you know, it's just the dad dogs.
[20:29.660 --> 20:31.260]  This guy's really took care of us.
[20:31.260 --> 20:33.060]  Yeah, nobody told me it was free.
[20:33.060 --> 20:34.100]  I was hungry.
[20:34.100 --> 20:36.780]  Yeah, it was.
[20:36.780 --> 20:40.900]  It was I think it was a free meatball sub or a free hot dog.
[20:41.220 --> 20:43.900]  And it was a free drink, you know, and I could have gone for the drink.
[20:43.980 --> 20:45.220]  That's great.
[20:45.220 --> 20:47.220]  And chips to Jeff. OK.

[20:52.340 --> 20:53.620]  There were POWs there.
[20:53.620 --> 20:55.580]  There were every type of military there.
[20:55.780 --> 20:57.220]  And then there were dad kids there.
[20:57.220 --> 21:00.020]  Yeah, there were normal civilians there that you couldn't tell
[21:00.140 --> 21:02.340]  what walk of life they came from.
[21:02.340 --> 21:06.420]  What's funny is we we opened up the dab bar from five to six.
[21:06.700 --> 21:08.820]  I think we kept it open until about six fifteen.
[21:09.460 --> 21:13.860]  Even the guys that came in were like we always you know, we ask first for the death.
[21:14.020 --> 21:15.460]  Have you ever dad before?
[21:15.460 --> 21:17.420]  Do you take big dabs, little dabs?
[21:17.420 --> 21:21.340]  You know, we were trying to be polite and make sure these guys weren't over
[21:21.340 --> 21:23.540]  medicating. I was sending him over there all day.
[21:23.540 --> 21:25.380]  My bad. Right.
[21:25.380 --> 21:27.700]  And these guys, nobody made it through over two rounds.

[21:30.380 --> 21:31.700]  Oh, yeah. Watching them.
[21:31.700 --> 21:33.500]  Well, they're like, oh, yeah, we take big days.

[24:20.620 --> 24:21.420]  You remember his name?
[24:21.420 --> 24:22.740]  Oh, I sure don't. It was a friend.
[24:22.740 --> 24:25.020]  He won the mothership and it was really cool
[24:25.020 --> 24:27.140]  because he came out of nowhere and seemed kind of shy.
[24:27.460 --> 24:29.060]  No offense. He was sort of a goofy dude.
[24:29.060 --> 24:31.660]  He also won the six pack.
[24:31.820 --> 24:34.020]  Yeah. Yeah. That dude killed it.
[24:34.020 --> 24:36.180]  And when he was a lot.
[24:36.180 --> 24:38.980]  Yeah. Which was. Yes.
[24:38.980 --> 24:41.140]  You could tell he wanted to drive to Colorado.
[24:41.140 --> 24:43.220]  You know, he just didn't know who to buddy up with at the event.
[24:43.220 --> 24:45.260]  And he bumped into Steven and made friends.
[24:45.260 --> 24:45.940]  Right. It was great.
[24:45.940 --> 24:47.940]  Yeah. Take anybody in as a friend because you're a cool guy.
[24:47.940 --> 24:49.780]  And I think absolutely a veteran.
[24:49.780 --> 24:50.780]  So it was. Yeah.
[24:50.780 --> 24:52.580]  You two bonded right away and made buddies.
[24:52.580 --> 24:53.140]  And then he won.
[24:53.140 --> 24:54.780]  It was really great to see that guy win.
[24:54.780 --> 24:56.820]  Oh, yeah. Colorado dry sift.
[24:57.340 --> 24:58.980]  Oh, got the screens. Yeah, I got.
[24:58.980 --> 25:00.460]  I got to say the screens myself.
[25:00.460 --> 25:01.700]  Yeah. He actually gave away.
[25:01.700 --> 25:03.220]  Super excited. That was great.
[25:03.220 --> 25:05.060]  Who was the guy next to your booth?
[25:05.060 --> 25:07.100]  That was DST. OK. Yeah.
[25:07.220 --> 25:08.460]  I think it was to the right.
[25:08.460 --> 25:10.980]  I think it was pretty much done by the time you got there.
[25:10.980 --> 25:13.780]  But man, I was bugging him all day for CBDT.
[25:13.820 --> 25:14.660]  That was a huge event.
[25:14.660 --> 25:16.180]  That's a lot of sponsors. You got more.
[25:16.180 --> 25:19.180]  Let's see here. I feel like we had 16, 20 unofficials.
[25:19.180 --> 25:21.660]  They donated 450 hash caps. Yeah.
[25:21.740 --> 25:23.260]  They gave me a bunch.
[25:23.260 --> 25:26.100]  Probably like an ounce and a half, two ounces worth of cannabis.
[25:26.140 --> 25:28.660]  Yeah. Who grew all the weed that you're donating to people.
[25:28.660 --> 25:30.860]  So that was.
[25:30.860 --> 25:32.900]  See here. Oh, now you're putting me on the spot.
[25:33.460 --> 25:35.140]  I got to Michael Lea plot before.
[25:35.140 --> 25:37.180]  I got to Kim. Yeah.
[25:37.180 --> 25:39.740]  He gave away the Kim dog and the Gorilla Glue for Kim.
[25:39.900 --> 25:40.780]  Stefan Bennett.
[25:40.780 --> 25:44.620]  He gave me like an ounce and a half of Harlequin.
[25:44.980 --> 25:48.540]  And then me, you know, my I left the Harlequin and gave you about an ounce.
[25:48.740 --> 25:52.940]  Yeah, I gave away about an ounce of my New York City diesel.
[25:52.940 --> 25:55.700]  I want to play some Sherbert.
[25:55.980 --> 25:57.860]  Gave away some Grateful Dog.
[25:57.860 --> 26:01.660]  We rolled up probably half an ounce and joints gave those out.
[26:01.660 --> 26:05.300]  And that was just a mix between all my strains that, you know,
[26:05.300 --> 26:06.700]  I usually carry around with me.
[26:06.700 --> 26:09.540]  And I got there and you walked up and didn't have time to talk.
[26:09.540 --> 26:12.020]  You're like, hey, man, good to see you. Want to join?
[26:12.020 --> 26:14.620]  Right. Yeah, sure. I was busy, man. I can do that.
[26:14.780 --> 26:16.780]  I mean, there were so many people I wanted to talk to that.
[26:16.780 --> 26:19.220]  Yeah, I wanted to get you on the show that day, but I could see it in your eye
[26:19.220 --> 26:21.340]  that you were pretty much done by the time the event was over.
[26:21.380 --> 26:23.620]  Oh, yeah, I was I was I was spent.
[26:23.620 --> 26:24.460]  I mean, that was crazy.
[26:24.460 --> 26:25.900]  That was the first event I've ever done.
[26:25.900 --> 26:28.700]  And I mean, it went down pretty smooth.
[26:28.700 --> 26:33.060]  I had I did have a veteran that was was upset the way it was going down.
[26:33.060 --> 26:36.820]  And I had him come back and I talked to him and, you know,
[26:37.260 --> 26:39.580]  he brought up a good point on some things.
[26:39.580 --> 26:41.660]  And so I hooked him up with a case nutrients.
[26:41.660 --> 26:44.380]  And was it like five or seven packs of genetics?
[26:44.580 --> 26:46.740]  Oh, yeah. Soil and a couple of joints.
[26:48.020 --> 26:49.260]  He left happy. Absolutely.
[26:49.260 --> 26:50.540]  Yeah, he left very happy.
[26:50.540 --> 26:52.060]  You know, and that's the thing, man.
[26:52.060 --> 26:56.900]  Like my my organization, I don't charge any membership fees to these veterans.
[26:56.900 --> 26:58.740]  It's free. They've already paid enough.
[26:58.740 --> 27:00.980]  These guys shouldn't have to pay a penny out of their pocket.
[27:01.220 --> 27:04.140]  So if somebody is a veteran in the Colorado Springs area,
[27:04.420 --> 27:07.660]  a cannabis user and needs some help, how can they get in touch with you?
[27:07.860 --> 27:12.500]  They can get in touch with me at the Veteran Farmers Alliance at Gmail dot com.
[27:12.700 --> 27:14.580]  You hear that? You guys get in touch.
[27:14.580 --> 27:16.780]  Steven will help you out. We'll help you out.
[27:16.780 --> 27:18.940]  The Veteran Farmers Alliance will take good care of you.
[27:19.260 --> 27:20.460]  We'll invite you to our next event.
[27:20.460 --> 27:21.700]  You can hang out the next event.
[27:21.700 --> 27:24.020]  I said our like I'm right now.
[27:24.020 --> 27:26.020]  You'll probably be there. You're always welcome.
[27:26.020 --> 27:27.580]  Always, you know.
[27:27.580 --> 27:28.820]  And, you know, here's another thing.
[27:28.820 --> 27:31.020]  The Veteran Farmers Alliance just doesn't stop there.
[27:31.300 --> 27:33.940]  You know, it takes organizations that are out there
[27:34.340 --> 27:36.780]  and brings them all together in one place.
[27:37.020 --> 27:39.740]  So veterans have an access to, you know, to care.
[27:39.780 --> 27:43.220]  They they can reach out to each organization that has these specialties
[27:43.500 --> 27:46.220]  and use that, you know, whatever pertains to them,
[27:46.220 --> 27:49.620]  whatever matches up with that organization and them, they use that.
[27:49.620 --> 27:50.900]  And then once they're done,
[27:50.900 --> 27:53.180]  then come see the other organization or they can use all of them.
[27:53.420 --> 27:56.340]  Now they have this central network hub of actual, you know,
[27:56.340 --> 28:00.180]  they can go to outreach functions, they can go to different events,
[28:00.180 --> 28:02.740]  they can go hiking, they go fishing.
[28:02.940 --> 28:04.900]  And that's that's bringing these organizations.
[28:04.900 --> 28:09.260]  This is, you know, this alternate therapy, you know, is just another way
[28:09.260 --> 28:12.980]  of helping these guys heal and being able to offer them that.
[28:12.980 --> 28:14.700]  That's like nobody's ever been able to do that.
[28:14.700 --> 28:16.740]  Everybody wants to make things a competition.
[28:17.220 --> 28:18.540]  But yet we're trying to save lives.
[28:18.540 --> 28:22.020]  We just need to all come together and stop the BS.
[28:22.060 --> 28:25.100]  Yes. And just say, hey, we're going to take care of these guys.
[28:25.300 --> 28:28.020]  You know what? I can't take care of them, but you can you take them
[28:28.020 --> 28:29.940]  when you're done with them. I'll take care of them.
[28:29.980 --> 28:32.100]  When I'm done with them, you go to that next organization.
[28:32.100 --> 28:34.300]  It's no competition. We're here to save lives.
[28:34.500 --> 28:38.060]  Let's drop this piddly bullshit and let's start doing what we need to do.
[28:38.100 --> 28:39.700]  Veterans unite pretty much.
[28:39.700 --> 28:41.540]  Absolutely. Go and the community.
[28:41.540 --> 28:43.220]  That's the most important part. Exactly.
[28:43.220 --> 28:44.940]  It's not just veterans.
[28:44.940 --> 28:48.020]  People need to see that the community and veterans can, you know,
[28:48.620 --> 28:52.620]  come together and they can integrate together and they can socialize.
[28:52.620 --> 28:54.060]  And there's no drama.
[28:54.060 --> 28:56.140]  You know, you can't do that in a bar.
[28:56.140 --> 28:58.060]  Somebody says the wrong thing.
[28:58.100 --> 29:00.940]  You know, somebody's drunk, move, fuck PTSD or this or that.
[29:00.940 --> 29:03.660]  Oh, man, you got to do something is going to get something in the face.
[29:03.700 --> 29:08.620]  Yeah. You know, and but you go to a cannabis club and people are able to sit
[29:08.620 --> 29:13.260]  back, relax, get some education, you know, throw some knowledge to these guys
[29:13.620 --> 29:18.500]  and and maybe show these guys what's really up with with cannabis.
[29:18.500 --> 29:20.060]  I mean, some people go in there. They're scared.
[29:20.060 --> 29:21.740]  They don't know what's going on. Right.
[29:21.740 --> 29:22.740]  You know, playing
[29:24.380 --> 29:27.620]  I think a lot of the clubs in town offer free entry for veterans.
[29:27.620 --> 29:30.180]  I know that we do the Lazy Lion.
[29:31.220 --> 29:32.660]  Does the dab lounge?
[29:32.660 --> 29:35.340]  Yes. Yes. The dab lounge.
[29:35.340 --> 29:38.340]  So if there's veterans that are out there that are maybe
[29:39.460 --> 29:41.900]  intimidated or nervous,
[29:41.900 --> 29:46.580]  we're very accepting, very welcoming to definitely veterans.
[29:46.580 --> 29:49.180]  We definitely appreciate all of your service.
[29:49.700 --> 29:54.740]  This is another thing you mentioned, PTSD and, you know, veterans are
[29:54.740 --> 29:56.300]  are the public face of it right now.
[29:56.300 --> 30:01.220]  But they are we know that we are really a tiny portion of the people
[30:01.220 --> 30:04.020]  in society that actually have PTSD.
[30:04.180 --> 30:05.780]  The vast majority are actually women.
[30:05.780 --> 30:11.220]  And we may be fighting a fight for our rights right now with PTSD.
[30:11.220 --> 30:16.900]  But we know that we're still fighting for the people who are way too hurt,
[30:16.900 --> 30:20.500]  too scared, too angry, too ashamed, too afraid,
[30:21.300 --> 30:22.900]  locked up in their home somewhere.
[30:22.900 --> 30:26.700]  We're fighting for them to in order for their rights
[30:26.700 --> 30:29.980]  to be recognized as well as ours. Absolutely.
[30:30.540 --> 30:33.700]  If you guys are intimidated to come to a social smoke lounge,
[30:34.780 --> 30:38.140]  the Cana Canyon has classy leather couches.
[30:38.460 --> 30:43.060]  They are comfortable. The walls are clean, soft, stylish, hardwood floors.
[30:43.060 --> 30:44.340]  We did. We did. Yeah.
[30:44.340 --> 30:45.780]  Kabuki and I met here for the first time.
[30:45.780 --> 30:47.780]  I pointed out that Kabuki and Steven met here.
[30:47.780 --> 30:48.380]  That's yeah.
[30:48.380 --> 30:49.780]  The scene, that's what it's all about.
[30:49.780 --> 30:51.740]  Yeah. Community building community here.
[30:51.740 --> 30:53.300]  And the place is classy, you guys. It's clean.
[30:53.300 --> 30:56.460]  It is super clean, handicap accessible restroom.
[30:56.740 --> 30:58.980]  It's a great place. So don't be afraid. Come check it out.
[30:59.180 --> 31:01.460]  It's not it's not like a bar. It's well lit.
[31:01.500 --> 31:04.220]  The music's not too loud. We can conversate.
[31:04.220 --> 31:05.660]  We can have conversation.
[31:05.660 --> 31:06.780]  Is conversation real word?
[31:06.780 --> 31:08.620]  It's conversation.
[31:09.420 --> 31:10.700]  Camille says it's real. It's real.
[31:10.700 --> 31:12.340]  Let's go with it. You can conversate in here.
[31:12.340 --> 31:14.580]  Yeah. It's got it together with the dictionary.
[31:14.740 --> 31:16.620]  Hashtag classy as fuck. I like this place.
[31:16.620 --> 31:18.140]  So don't be shy. Come hang out.
[31:18.140 --> 31:21.500]  I don't feel like if you're new at smoking, if you're not a dab kid,
[31:21.500 --> 31:23.780]  if you're not into the whole scene, we'll help you out.
[31:23.780 --> 31:26.140]  I'll give you your first dab. I won't make you choke. I'll help you out.
[31:26.700 --> 31:27.940]  Teach you how to use the rig.
[31:27.940 --> 31:30.300]  We'll roll you a nice. Absolutely. We'll educate you.
[31:30.380 --> 31:32.620]  Yeah, we got their bottles of water on the shelf over here.
[31:32.620 --> 31:35.020]  You'll be well taken care of. Don't be afraid.
[31:35.020 --> 31:39.420]  And other than that, there's no legal place for people to congregate and consume.
[31:39.420 --> 31:41.500]  So if you want to go somewhere and smoke
[31:41.500 --> 31:44.100]  other than hanging out in the car behind some building or something
[31:44.100 --> 31:48.180]  or being out somewhere in public, which we're technically legally not allowed
[31:48.180 --> 31:51.300]  to do and, you know, to be respectful of others, you know,
[31:51.340 --> 31:54.500]  I don't feel the need for others to smell my medicine.
[31:54.500 --> 31:56.460]  And that's just me being considerate.
[31:56.460 --> 32:01.100]  But I also as a patient and as someone who's over the age of 21
[32:01.100 --> 32:05.780]  recreationally don't have a lot of safe places to go, you know,
[32:05.780 --> 32:09.140]  and not everyone works in the industry
[32:09.140 --> 32:12.460]  or has made their lifestyle around everything that we do.
[32:12.740 --> 32:17.420]  So in those moments where a patient or a normal record
[32:17.420 --> 32:22.660]  or occasional recreational user might want a safe place to enjoy cannabis.
[32:23.180 --> 32:25.220]  What are we going to do if these places aren't around?
[32:26.420 --> 32:27.740]  Got to go do something shady.
[32:27.740 --> 32:32.620]  The fact is, is that if they pass laws banning these types of establishments,
[32:32.620 --> 32:35.060]  they're going to push people out into their public spaces.
[32:35.260 --> 32:37.620]  And who wants to smell weed wherever they go?
[32:37.620 --> 32:39.900]  Yeah, nobody wants to smell weed wherever they go.
[32:39.940 --> 32:42.860]  Well, everyone, you know, to go to people.
[32:43.100 --> 32:45.180]  We're a special breed. Exactly.
[32:46.180 --> 32:48.660]  There's a large majority of people out there
[32:48.660 --> 32:51.700]  who probably aren't going to want to smell weed in the public parks.
[32:51.940 --> 32:56.900]  Why do you give people bars so they won't sit on a public park bench
[32:56.900 --> 32:59.340]  and drink somewhere? Such a great point.
[32:59.540 --> 33:01.300]  I'm a cannabis consumer. I'm a breeder.
[33:01.300 --> 33:02.660]  I'm all about the cannabis life.
[33:02.660 --> 33:06.100]  But I do have a daughter that I don't hide her from cannabis.
[33:06.100 --> 33:08.500]  I don't hide cannabis from her. She knows what cannabis is.
[33:08.700 --> 33:10.820]  She is not attracted to the smell of it at all.
[33:10.980 --> 33:14.620]  But I don't think that anybody should have to be at the park with their child
[33:14.620 --> 33:16.740]  and explain what those guys over there are doing.
[33:17.020 --> 33:18.820]  Yeah, that's not to be.
[33:18.820 --> 33:19.820]  It should be your fault.
[33:19.820 --> 33:21.820]  But I have to talk with my daughter about that.
[33:21.820 --> 33:23.900]  Yeah, it shouldn't be anybody's fault.
[33:23.900 --> 33:25.940]  No, it's true. I should decide when that conversation.
[33:25.940 --> 33:28.700]  No, absolutely. Yeah. Keep that in mind, you guys.
[33:28.700 --> 33:31.860]  Don't go dabbing at the park. Yeah, those guys. Right.
[33:33.100 --> 33:36.180]  Everyone just looks at me like, no, no, no, no.
[33:36.180 --> 33:37.380]  I completely agree.
[33:37.380 --> 33:40.140]  I have a daughter. I very much feel the same way, you know.
[33:40.380 --> 33:41.660]  Right. You know, it's funny.
[33:41.660 --> 33:44.020]  I was in city council me and I looked up.
[33:44.380 --> 33:47.140]  I was like, how many liquor stores are there in Colorado Springs?
[33:47.140 --> 33:49.620]  And I was like, hmm, 104.
[33:49.620 --> 33:53.100]  I said, how many bars are there in Colorado Springs?
[33:53.100 --> 33:55.020]  One hundred and eighty eight. Wow.
[33:55.020 --> 33:58.540]  But 15 cannabis clubs. Oh, everybody loses their shit.
[33:59.380 --> 34:01.180]  I mean, what? Come on, guys.
[34:01.180 --> 34:03.180]  It's kind of like when they did the whole caregiver act.
[34:03.180 --> 34:05.620]  It's like it's like it's not even one percent of the people that grow
[34:05.620 --> 34:06.860]  in Colorado are caregivers.
[34:06.860 --> 34:09.100]  Did they sneak something in at that city council?
[34:09.100 --> 34:11.260]  Yes. And they didn't even talk about that.
[34:11.260 --> 34:12.420]  Pissed me off.
[34:12.460 --> 34:14.460]  Oh, boy. So they wanted to restrict the rest.
[34:14.460 --> 34:15.940]  Let's hear the residential plan.
[34:15.940 --> 34:17.300]  Countess, 12 plants.
[34:17.300 --> 34:21.340]  12. Yeah. So huge problem with that
[34:21.900 --> 34:25.980]  in the fact that I have a large concentration of pediatric patients here
[34:25.980 --> 34:28.980]  that they're not even epileptic for the most part.
[34:28.980 --> 34:31.340]  Their cancer patients, they supply on it.
[34:31.900 --> 34:36.940]  They rely on a heavy supply of, you know, THC, heavy material and 12 plants
[34:37.580 --> 34:41.260]  sometimes doesn't even cut 60 days of medicine for them,
[34:41.260 --> 34:43.420]  depending on what they're working with.
[34:43.460 --> 34:47.460]  You know, most of these guys are, you know, they're not commercial growers.
[34:47.460 --> 34:47.940]  They're not.
[34:47.940 --> 34:51.780]  You know, they're modestly growing organically and getting, you know, decent
[34:51.780 --> 34:56.540]  yields, but these parents can do a lot better with some,
[34:56.580 --> 35:01.500]  you know, with more decent numbers, but restricting it to 12, I feel is just
[35:02.260 --> 35:04.740]  it's going to cause caregivers a lot more headaches.
[35:04.740 --> 35:07.220]  It's going to cause parents who are trying to grow themselves
[35:07.220 --> 35:11.420]  because they can't go to dispensaries to get what they need
[35:11.420 --> 35:14.380]  because they might not have it or whatever the case is.
[35:16.180 --> 35:20.140]  I just feel that it's unfair and very
[35:22.140 --> 35:23.700]  unjust. Yeah.
[35:23.700 --> 35:26.300]  I was just about to say it seems like time and time again,
[35:26.300 --> 35:29.300]  it kind of feels like we're not getting what we voted for.
[35:29.300 --> 35:30.540]  Yeah, absolutely.
[35:30.540 --> 35:34.300]  It's I feel like they're pushing the medical market away
[35:34.300 --> 35:36.740]  and forcing everybody to go shop at the dispensary.
[35:37.020 --> 35:39.860]  They want to get rid of the caregivers and they want all of the tax money.
[35:39.860 --> 35:41.340]  They do. They were the dispensaries.
[35:41.340 --> 35:43.340]  They're actively pushing for that.
[35:43.340 --> 35:48.260]  And there are senators who are trying to take away home grow
[35:48.660 --> 35:51.100]  as we speak this this year.
[35:51.100 --> 35:55.940]  Actually, I saw some language off of I'm going to go ahead and call her out.
[35:56.580 --> 36:01.300]  Senator Conti, her desk that wanted to limit all
[36:02.020 --> 36:05.780]  caregivers and patients in the state to six plants maximum.
[36:05.980 --> 36:08.020]  And this would not only affect
[36:09.380 --> 36:13.660]  individuals, but it would affect structures so that an apartment
[36:13.660 --> 36:17.580]  complex complex would have a maximum of six plants in that apartment.
[36:17.940 --> 36:19.700]  And I lived in the same apartment building.
[36:19.700 --> 36:21.860]  You'd be screwed over plants. Yeah, exactly.
[36:21.860 --> 36:23.540]  You're then committing a felony.
[36:23.540 --> 36:25.780]  That's and it was of us are committing a felony.
[36:25.780 --> 36:27.740]  Yes, we know about each other.
[36:27.740 --> 36:31.900]  So, you know, thankfully, we managed to get that language removed from that bill.
[36:32.300 --> 36:35.980]  But there are a lot of issues like this that are coming up
[36:36.300 --> 36:38.380]  that are coming from from the industry.
[36:38.700 --> 36:43.020]  They're they're being actively lobbied for by recreational
[36:43.020 --> 36:48.420]  and and some medical facilities to ones that are joint medical rec.
[36:48.420 --> 36:50.660]  But they're trying to eliminate medical rights
[36:50.980 --> 36:53.900]  and push everybody into the recreational market.
[36:54.020 --> 36:57.460]  And a lot of those dispensary owners have issues with clubs like this
[36:57.820 --> 37:00.020]  because they think that it's going to ruin their business.
[37:00.340 --> 37:03.940]  As a yet. No, not that we've noticed.
[37:03.940 --> 37:05.180]  It's still growing.
[37:05.180 --> 37:07.020]  Yeah. Our shop is still open.
[37:07.020 --> 37:08.220]  This place is still open.
[37:08.220 --> 37:12.500]  And every one of the business owners that I know, they are all happy
[37:12.500 --> 37:14.700]  for wanting regulation.
[37:14.700 --> 37:16.740]  They're all for licensing.
[37:16.740 --> 37:21.740]  None of these people that I know that run these clubs have an alter
[37:22.140 --> 37:25.380]  motive to take money from any establishment,
[37:25.380 --> 37:29.940]  but to provide a service for people that is genuinely needed.
[37:30.020 --> 37:31.540]  And that's my honest two cents.
[37:31.540 --> 37:33.540]  I don't work for any of these clubs.
[37:33.820 --> 37:36.740]  I, you know, visit them from time to time.
[37:36.740 --> 37:38.580]  And that's just honestly how I feel.
[37:38.580 --> 37:41.660]  You're here every time I'm here, Bill.
[37:41.660 --> 37:44.460]  The time I show up, I don't mention I'm coming and you're here.
[37:44.620 --> 37:46.180]  Hey, man, what can I say?
[37:46.180 --> 37:47.260]  I love great minds.
[37:47.260 --> 37:47.980]  The guy came out.
[37:47.980 --> 37:49.420]  You look like you got something you want to say.
[37:49.420 --> 37:50.740]  I did. And I forgot.
[37:50.740 --> 37:52.220]  So I'm sorry, Camille.
[37:52.220 --> 37:53.940]  Donor. It's OK. Take a dab.
[37:53.940 --> 37:55.860]  It'll come back to you. Yeah, fair enough.
[37:55.860 --> 37:58.980]  There's a black cherry chem alive resin on the table, which, by the way,
[37:58.980 --> 38:01.020]  tastes fantastic. Thank you. Thank you.
[38:01.020 --> 38:02.660]  Oh, it's tasty. I bred it.
[38:02.660 --> 38:04.420]  We grew it over at the Green and Healthy Garden
[38:04.420 --> 38:06.220]  and then our friends at Turpex blasted that.
[38:06.220 --> 38:07.660]  So shout out to the whole crew there.
[38:07.660 --> 38:10.100]  Yeah, that was called synergy. Synergy.
[38:10.100 --> 38:11.220]  I like it.
[38:11.220 --> 38:14.700]  You've got a lot to say about the 12 plant, don't you?
[38:15.300 --> 38:16.940]  I'm very upset over this.
[38:16.940 --> 38:21.420]  I I'm I'm basically allergic to every single
[38:21.980 --> 38:24.380]  prescription pill out there.
[38:24.460 --> 38:26.460]  The one I'm not allergic to a lot of the listeners.
[38:26.860 --> 38:28.860]  A lot of the listeners might not be familiar.
[38:29.260 --> 38:31.340]  We tell us a little bit briefly about your injury.
[38:31.420 --> 38:35.180]  OK, so on April 11th of 2008,
[38:35.940 --> 38:38.700]  I was doing route clearance as a combat engineer
[38:39.580 --> 38:43.500]  in Sauder City and I was hit by Pacific with Sauder City.
[38:43.540 --> 38:46.100]  It's in Iraq. OK, a lot of our listeners will. Right. Right.
[38:46.100 --> 38:47.020]  Yeah. Sorry. I'm sorry.
[38:47.020 --> 38:49.860]  Colorado. Not exactly.
[38:49.860 --> 38:51.660]  But let's specify that right now.
[38:51.660 --> 38:54.820]  We were ambushed and the fifth IED that went off
[38:55.100 --> 38:57.620]  blew a 13 inch hole into my vehicle
[38:57.940 --> 39:02.220]  and blew a five inch hole into my back, causing my my hip to be shattered,
[39:02.220 --> 39:06.500]  my pelvis to be broken and my spine to be shifted forward,
[39:07.220 --> 39:09.540]  causing me to have a little bit of spinal injury.
[39:10.380 --> 39:12.500]  Had over 200 pieces of shrapnel in me.
[39:13.380 --> 39:17.300]  And I took about three and a half months for the wound to close up.
[39:17.340 --> 39:19.380]  Very lucky to be alive. Absolutely.
[39:19.380 --> 39:20.420]  Thanks for pulling through.
[39:20.420 --> 39:22.580]  Me. Thank you. I'm very happy to be here.
[39:22.620 --> 39:23.940]  Thanks, Steve.
[39:23.940 --> 39:26.300]  I've seen for real. Thanks to you back.
[39:26.900 --> 39:30.060]  And for the listeners, it looks like if you took a normal dude's back
[39:30.060 --> 39:32.020]  and excuse me if I'm no, you're good. Go ahead.
[39:32.020 --> 39:33.980]  Boundary. You can I I'm a big dude.
[39:33.980 --> 39:36.020]  I could put my fist in the hole.
[39:36.020 --> 39:37.580]  That's exactly how I describe it.
[39:37.580 --> 39:40.860]  You could like to fill the hole with putty would take your fist.
[39:40.900 --> 39:43.500]  Yeah, like it's insane. It's tremendous.
[39:43.500 --> 39:46.500]  My wife, she jokes. She's like, oh, we need to slap a little bondo on it.
[39:46.500 --> 39:47.980]  Let it stick.
[39:47.980 --> 39:49.980]  I think that should be good. Right.
[39:49.980 --> 39:52.140]  You know, some spackle.
[39:52.140 --> 39:54.420]  All right. All right. Continuing, right?
[39:54.420 --> 39:59.220]  But, you know, the whole 12 plant count thing, like, I mean, I consume so much.
[39:59.220 --> 40:02.140]  I ingest a smoke.
[40:02.140 --> 40:04.380]  I dab. I use topicals.
[40:04.380 --> 40:08.940]  And, you know, for them to cut me down to 12 when I have a 65 plant count
[40:09.940 --> 40:13.780]  is asinine. It's it's just with they're not doctors.
[40:13.780 --> 40:17.060]  There's no way for them to judge who needs what.
[40:17.100 --> 40:19.020]  I mean, the standard whatever.
[40:19.020 --> 40:20.180]  They're not medical doctors.
[40:20.180 --> 40:24.820]  I spent three hours with my medical doctor going over my plant program.
[40:25.020 --> 40:29.500]  Failure rates, pesticide rates, clone failure rates, you know,
[40:30.500 --> 40:34.700]  successful harvest, you know, like fan failures, light failures.
[40:35.260 --> 40:38.340]  And, you know, you go over that and then we're like, OK, we have finished product.
[40:38.340 --> 40:40.500]  This is what's usable. This was is usable.
[40:40.660 --> 40:45.220]  And then for city council to have no training in the medical field
[40:45.220 --> 40:49.780]  to to not even understand what a plant count means to somebody,
[40:49.780 --> 40:53.540]  to not even understand what you know, what level of a grower they're at,
[40:53.660 --> 40:56.460]  you know, is is just it's unforgivable.
[40:56.500 --> 40:57.980]  It's just an insult.
[40:57.980 --> 41:00.260]  And I'm not going to abide by it.
[41:00.260 --> 41:04.260]  I won't because I paid for that extended plant count.
[41:04.260 --> 41:06.740]  I have proven every right why I need that plant count.
[41:06.900 --> 41:08.420]  And they are not going to take that away.
[41:08.420 --> 41:10.460]  It should stand up in court. Oh, absolutely.
[41:10.460 --> 41:12.300]  And I think it has before.
[41:12.300 --> 41:14.540]  You're going to file a lawsuit against the city of Colorado Springs.
[41:14.540 --> 41:16.700]  Yes, sir. Will your lawyer come to court with you?
[41:16.980 --> 41:19.180]  Are you going to find out your lawyer? Oh, absolutely.
[41:19.540 --> 41:20.940]  Absolutely. I'm sure.
[41:20.940 --> 41:24.300]  Good, because I have over 6000 pages of medical documents
[41:24.300 --> 41:28.100]  that can prove to them that in every single manner they are wrong.
[41:28.380 --> 41:31.300]  You've got better SOPs than some dispensaries I've gone to.
[41:34.260 --> 41:37.420]  Your notation and note taking and your your planning
[41:37.420 --> 41:39.740]  is better than some major grows in this state, bro.
[41:39.820 --> 41:41.180]  I just well, I appreciate it, man.
[41:41.180 --> 41:43.420]  I just I take this seriously. This is my medicine.
[41:43.420 --> 41:45.460]  This is what keeps me alive.
[41:45.460 --> 41:47.180]  Can people follow you on Instagram? Do you want to give out?
[41:47.180 --> 41:48.700]  Absolutely. Yes.
[41:48.700 --> 41:51.300]  My my Instagram name is Triceratops.
[41:51.380 --> 41:53.580]  He's got some great pictures of grateful dog. He does.
[41:53.780 --> 41:54.300]  I love that.
[41:54.300 --> 41:56.620]  Triceratops on Instagram. He's got a hell of a great grow.
[41:56.660 --> 41:59.180]  Absolutely. One of my favorite strains. Well, thank you. Thank you.
[41:59.180 --> 42:01.700]  I appreciate your job with that one. Well, thank you very much.
[42:01.980 --> 42:04.260]  Yeah, I would not have met these guys if it weren't for a club.
[42:04.260 --> 42:07.180]  So I'm very grateful for absolutely what it's all about.
[42:07.220 --> 42:09.300]  I mean, there's nothing crazy going on.
[42:09.300 --> 42:10.740]  Nobody's slamming into walls.
[42:10.740 --> 42:12.900]  Nobody's arguing or fighting.
[42:12.900 --> 42:13.780]  There's no drama.
[42:13.780 --> 42:16.100]  I've got a question for Camille, but she just took a big old dab.
[42:16.100 --> 42:17.900]  So I'm going to give her half a second. You good? You ready?
[42:17.980 --> 42:19.900]  All right. All right.
[42:19.900 --> 42:22.580]  Have you ever had anybody act up or try to fight in here?
[42:23.100 --> 42:25.100]  Fight? Yeah. She looked at me.
[42:25.100 --> 42:26.980]  Oh, I don't fight in here. No.
[42:26.980 --> 42:31.580]  So the craziest thing that happened was we like to keep a certain atmosphere
[42:31.580 --> 42:34.020]  for our members. It's very important to us.
[42:34.020 --> 42:38.740]  So occasionally we'll have a member come in who is intoxicated.
[42:39.100 --> 42:43.900]  And in that moment, you know, we try and scooch him out as fast as possible.
[42:43.900 --> 42:48.260]  But occasionally they will get into the main lounge just by people exiting.
[42:49.340 --> 42:54.180]  So there's been one instance where we had to escort someone off the the premises.
[42:54.180 --> 42:55.740]  But it was fairly easy.
[42:55.740 --> 42:59.340]  They went they went kind of willingly.
[42:59.340 --> 43:01.980]  So that helped. And they were drunk, too.
[43:01.980 --> 43:06.620]  So, um, no, we just had to deal with a couple of drunk people.
[43:06.660 --> 43:08.820]  That completely proved my point.
[43:08.820 --> 43:11.660]  Right. The only problems at the cannabis social lounge
[43:11.860 --> 43:13.540]  or the drunk people that showed up.
[43:13.540 --> 43:17.780]  The thing that I can really appreciate, too, is more than once
[43:17.980 --> 43:23.300]  we've had members kind of bring something that someone has left up to the counter.
[43:23.340 --> 43:27.740]  Kabuki is notorious for leaving stuff here. Yes.
[43:28.540 --> 43:31.500]  So if you leave your rig here, your car, whatever.
[43:31.660 --> 43:36.860]  I left my wallet on the counter here earlier and it was promptly returned to me.
[43:36.860 --> 43:39.340]  It was another. Yeah.
[43:39.420 --> 43:41.020]  You call members members.
[43:41.020 --> 43:43.660]  Another member shouted, whose wallet?
[43:43.660 --> 43:45.820]  This is a place where people look out for each other.
[43:45.820 --> 43:48.340]  This is a safe location.
[43:48.340 --> 43:50.740]  And this is one of the problems that they had with the
[43:51.500 --> 43:53.980]  the the city council meeting.
[43:53.980 --> 43:56.620]  They said that it wasn't safe, but these are safe places.
[43:56.620 --> 43:57.740]  No, absolutely.
[43:57.740 --> 44:00.580]  They sounded so uneducated at the meeting.
[44:00.740 --> 44:02.780]  Yeah. There's nothing going to happen here.
[44:02.780 --> 44:06.580]  No, no. Unless the city council comes and causes a problem.
[44:07.500 --> 44:10.220]  What's really frustrating is all of it.
[44:10.700 --> 44:12.420]  Matt was talking. Is it OK if I call you Matt?
[44:12.420 --> 44:14.540]  I do prefer. Yeah, go right. OK.
[44:14.540 --> 44:17.100]  Matt was talking about a kid who pay and
[44:18.980 --> 44:19.900]  can repay.
[44:19.900 --> 44:21.860]  Is that what is it? How you pronounce it?
[44:21.860 --> 44:24.340]  Like, yeah, Senator Kit Rupay. Yeah.
[44:24.340 --> 44:26.340]  Mess it is name all up. Sorry, man.
[44:26.340 --> 44:28.300]  It's a weird name. It is. It's a weird name.
[44:29.220 --> 44:34.140]  So they've been working on this, this license for the clubs.
[44:34.140 --> 44:39.700]  And there there came out and said nothing's made in a vacuum.
[44:40.220 --> 44:41.380]  And that's very true.
[44:41.380 --> 44:44.220]  And what's frustrating is it feels like city council
[44:44.220 --> 44:46.940]  does not have that mentality at all.
[44:47.300 --> 44:49.860]  They can't seem to grasp or understand
[44:51.380 --> 44:54.180]  a few different sides, whether it be veterans,
[44:55.100 --> 44:59.700]  people who consume on a recreational level, even just business owners.
[44:59.700 --> 45:03.900]  They just don't seem to want to listen to what we have to say.
[45:04.380 --> 45:06.540]  Um, but yeah, I can't repay.
[45:06.540 --> 45:10.260]  And Jonathan Singer are doing some really awesome, progressive stuff
[45:10.260 --> 45:14.180]  with the licensing and trying to make these clubs
[45:15.540 --> 45:17.300]  here to stay, which I can appreciate.
[45:17.300 --> 45:20.780]  But Colorado Springs, another story. Right.
[45:20.860 --> 45:22.580]  Yeah. We have the same issues in Pueblo.
[45:22.580 --> 45:26.820]  It feels like our city council hears us and we're like, we want social clubs.
[45:26.820 --> 45:28.700]  And they turn around and they talk to each other and they turn around.
[45:28.700 --> 45:29.700]  They go, guess what?
[45:29.700 --> 45:31.820]  That's crazy how that happens, too.
[45:31.820 --> 45:34.900]  They just like, yeah, have these conversations right in front of you.
[45:34.900 --> 45:37.340]  And it's insane. Yeah.
[45:37.500 --> 45:40.340]  And they aren't they there to represent us?
[45:40.340 --> 45:42.660]  Aren't we supposed to be telling them what they want?
[45:42.660 --> 45:43.820]  They provide it.
[45:43.820 --> 45:46.220]  And then 200 people show up and they say, we want this.
[45:46.220 --> 45:48.100]  And two people say no.
[45:48.100 --> 45:50.500]  And the whole city council can say, oh, yeah, no.
[45:52.020 --> 45:53.620]  I did that.
[45:53.620 --> 45:55.620]  You were saying it's just stacked.
[45:56.500 --> 45:57.420]  Yeah.
[45:58.220 --> 46:00.220]  It's incredibly upsetting to me.
[46:00.220 --> 46:02.620]  So sorry if I'm for a lack of words at the moment.
[46:02.620 --> 46:06.340]  But yeah, that is infuriating to see that. And
[46:07.660 --> 46:10.060]  I mean, it's like four people come up.
[46:10.060 --> 46:11.660]  Wait is bad.
[46:11.660 --> 46:14.300]  And they're spitting out facts that you could go on the Internet.
[46:14.300 --> 46:16.380]  And it's like, yeah, that's been disproven.
[46:16.380 --> 46:19.260]  They're reading shit off a piece of paper, not looking anyone in the eye
[46:19.260 --> 46:21.300]  and then walking out of the room right afterwards.
[46:21.300 --> 46:25.060]  And it's in its stack because they had the people that were for against
[46:25.060 --> 46:26.700]  all go up first.
[46:26.700 --> 46:29.180]  It's not like, you know, normal sessions.
[46:29.500 --> 46:32.380]  Everybody's allowed to voice their opinion, whether for or against.
[46:32.380 --> 46:34.140]  Right. Equally at the same time.
[46:34.140 --> 46:35.420]  And what you can hear both sides.
[46:35.420 --> 46:38.420]  No, it's they said their thing and they got to leave because they're like,
[46:38.420 --> 46:40.220]  yeah, we're not going to make these old people stay.
[46:40.220 --> 46:41.300]  And that's who it was.
[46:41.300 --> 46:43.180]  The people that were complaining were over 60.
[46:43.180 --> 46:44.460]  And you know what? That's not cool.
[46:44.460 --> 46:46.500]  We from and you made a very bad point, Matt.
[46:46.500 --> 46:47.580]  That's exactly what it was.
[46:47.580 --> 46:49.980]  A lot of these complaints for madness propaganda.
[46:49.980 --> 46:52.340]  Exactly. And a lot of people that were making these complaints
[46:52.340 --> 46:56.820]  are more about the opposition of what happened after we voted in Amendment 64
[46:57.020 --> 46:58.500]  than about the clubs themselves.
[46:58.500 --> 47:02.500]  And I feel like that distinction was completely lost in translation.
[47:03.260 --> 47:06.780]  Yeah, most of them like they would say things like my
[47:06.980 --> 47:11.740]  I live next door to an apartment complex and the people there, they smoke.
[47:12.100 --> 47:17.900]  They smoke marijuanas and they they they grow the marijuanas
[47:17.900 --> 47:21.500]  and they vent it right out into the open and it's so loud.
[47:21.500 --> 47:26.060]  It's like it had nothing to do with the actual consumption clubs whatsoever.
[47:26.100 --> 47:31.260]  It was just they were complaining about the the ancillary effects of Amendment 64.
[47:31.460 --> 47:33.100]  They're just stuck in the mud.
[47:33.100 --> 47:37.020]  And if they have a problem with it, then they should take it up
[47:37.020 --> 47:41.340]  with the voters who actually voted Amendment 64 into our state
[47:41.340 --> 47:45.020]  constitution is a constitutional right now instead of stepping up now.
[47:45.060 --> 47:46.340]  I agree with you.
[47:46.340 --> 47:48.460]  Yeah, I love when people call it marijuanas.
[47:48.540 --> 47:51.820]  Yeah, marijuana, the marijuana is, you know, they're highly pluralized.
[47:51.820 --> 47:53.460]  It because we know so much about it.
[47:53.500 --> 47:57.460]  Them marijuana is also CBD.
[47:58.660 --> 48:02.220]  I don't like it when people pluralize CBD, the CBD's.
[48:02.260 --> 48:04.740]  Yeah, you say THC's.
[48:04.740 --> 48:05.900]  It just doesn't make sense.
[48:05.900 --> 48:08.980]  I need a glass of waters. Yeah.
[48:08.980 --> 48:10.660]  All right, guys. Thank you for saying that.
[48:10.660 --> 48:12.420]  Yeah, I sometimes I have some shit on my chest.
[48:12.420 --> 48:14.820]  I just need to get off on a podcast. Oh, my goodness.
[48:14.860 --> 48:17.580]  Yeah, we won't even get on the left lane drivers anymore.
[48:17.620 --> 48:20.020]  Oh, good. Yeah.
[48:20.020 --> 48:21.180]  So these clubs are important, you guys.
[48:21.180 --> 48:23.900]  We need to do everything we can to absolutely counsel to.
[48:25.500 --> 48:27.060]  Well, what can we do for the next eight years?
[48:27.060 --> 48:28.780]  Is there anything we can do to sway them on that one?
[48:28.780 --> 48:30.460]  Or is that a permanent thing here in Springs?
[48:30.460 --> 48:32.540]  Well, oh, no, go ahead.
[48:32.580 --> 48:36.260]  OK, so right now what I can say is that there are petitions
[48:36.260 --> 48:40.780]  at a lot of the clubs here in town to kind of.
[48:43.500 --> 48:44.300]  What's the word?
[48:44.300 --> 48:47.380]  Recall? Yeah, we call the the band.
[48:47.380 --> 48:51.020]  So you can get out there, you can put your name on the list.
[48:51.020 --> 48:54.300]  No, let your city know that this is not something you're down for.
[48:54.660 --> 48:56.940]  And that's what we can do initially.
[48:56.940 --> 49:00.380]  There's also an online petition to there's an online petition as well.
[49:00.380 --> 49:02.940]  Steven says Steven and Camille are politely sharing a mic.
[49:02.940 --> 49:05.500]  So sometimes Steven gets cut off here.
[49:05.500 --> 49:07.860]  He's looking for the petition. He's searching in his phone.
[49:07.860 --> 49:11.500]  So since I am not a Colorado Springs resident, am I able to sign that petition?
[49:11.540 --> 49:13.940]  I guess it's a Colorado state.
[49:13.940 --> 49:15.820]  All right. So I will sign that for you guys.
[49:15.820 --> 49:17.180]  Thank you. Pueblo resident.
[49:17.180 --> 49:19.020]  So that's awesome. Thank you.
[49:19.020 --> 49:19.940]  I guess that's awesome.
[49:19.940 --> 49:21.940]  Well, you're going to be a Pueblo guy.
[49:21.940 --> 49:23.020]  Yeah, I will be. I'm sorry.
[49:23.020 --> 49:23.900]  Should I have said that on the show?
[49:23.900 --> 49:25.100]  No, you're good. I don't give a shit.
[49:25.100 --> 49:27.460]  Come find me in Pueblo.
[49:27.460 --> 49:28.940]  Welcome to the hood.
[49:28.940 --> 49:30.100]  I'm excited, dude.
[49:30.100 --> 49:32.140]  I don't know how to be on the podcast more frequently.
[49:32.260 --> 49:36.020]  Yeah. And so my friend who just totally off topic,
[49:36.020 --> 49:40.980]  but he just got 300 acres in Pueblo and totally dedicated to a CBD girl.
[49:41.220 --> 49:44.220]  So I'm going to be doing a little bit of consulting out there with him as well.
[49:44.220 --> 49:45.620]  So be some fun stuff.
[49:45.620 --> 49:47.420]  If you guys need help, I know the guy for you.
[49:47.420 --> 49:49.140]  He's been on the podcast several times.
[49:49.140 --> 49:51.940]  Sweet shit. Yeah. Awesome. Sweet. All right.
[49:51.980 --> 49:53.620]  OK, so we got this website.
[49:53.620 --> 49:56.820]  Looks like the website is Geo petition.
[49:57.620 --> 50:00.460]  G.E.O. Oh, go petition.
[50:00.460 --> 50:02.820]  I'm sorry. Go petition.
[50:02.820 --> 50:06.540]  G.O.P.E.T.I.T.I.O.N. Dotcom.
[50:06.980 --> 50:11.780]  And then just search stop social club ban.
[50:12.540 --> 50:13.660]  And it'll come up.
[50:13.660 --> 50:16.980]  So I just want to hang out at home, smoke a couple of bowls.
[50:16.980 --> 50:21.420]  Might as well jump on your computer and phone or your Facebook anyway.
[50:21.820 --> 50:24.540]  Wow. Anyway, go spend that time signing a petition.
[50:24.540 --> 50:26.620]  It's so go petition.
[50:26.620 --> 50:29.700]  Dotcom. So all you have to do is open the show notes and click it.
[50:29.700 --> 50:33.300]  If you've got a phone tap on the on my face, if you're looking at my face
[50:33.300 --> 50:35.980]  on your face or on your iTunes, tap on my face.
[50:35.980 --> 50:37.420]  It'll spin around and show you show notes.
[50:37.420 --> 50:38.540]  There's a link in there.
[50:38.540 --> 50:40.580]  Click on that link. It'll take you to this petition.
[50:40.580 --> 50:43.300]  You guys do it so I can spin your face over and over.
[50:44.300 --> 50:47.100]  It'll just show you the show notes in my face and my show notes in my face.
[50:47.620 --> 50:49.220]  Go to my website. It'll be in the show notes.
[50:49.220 --> 50:51.820]  Also go to the website, go to the Grow From Your Heart podcast tab.
[50:52.100 --> 50:54.140]  Click on the newest episode. It'll be right there in the show.
[50:54.140 --> 50:55.060]  And I said, we'll be a link.
[50:55.060 --> 50:57.540]  If you're lazy, you won't have to type anything in. We'll hook you up.
[50:58.180 --> 51:00.340]  Want everybody in Colorado to sign it?
[51:00.820 --> 51:05.380]  If you're a computer nerd, figure out some way to set up your computer and proxy in.
[51:05.620 --> 51:10.140]  Yes. Change your IP address every time and just do it a billion times.
[51:10.180 --> 51:12.740]  Absolutely. I didn't say that on the air.
[51:12.740 --> 51:14.860]  Hire some kid in Malaysia to do it on Fiverr.
[51:14.860 --> 51:17.300]  Yeah, that's fine. I'm not going to argue with you.
[51:17.340 --> 51:20.820]  Also in the community after that whole city council thing went down,
[51:20.820 --> 51:23.860]  a lot of people are talking about running for office now.
[51:24.340 --> 51:27.260]  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Someone needs to. Kabuki.
[51:28.340 --> 51:31.900]  OK, the problem with that is a lot
[51:33.620 --> 51:34.620]  maybe in Pueblo.
[51:34.620 --> 51:36.700]  But here's the thing.
[51:36.700 --> 51:38.180]  What's happening in the Springs right now?
[51:38.180 --> 51:39.780]  Yes, we obviously need a voice.
[51:39.780 --> 51:40.980]  We need a voice on that council.
[51:40.980 --> 51:45.580]  But I think it also starts with maybe removing if these people
[51:45.580 --> 51:48.500]  who are supposed to represent us won't listen, then maybe they shouldn't be
[51:48.500 --> 51:50.420]  representing us. And that's what it comes down to.
[51:50.420 --> 51:51.020]  That's their job.
[51:51.020 --> 51:55.180]  So maybe getting that rotten apple out of the bunch and trying to
[51:55.460 --> 51:59.500]  progressively put someone who will voice all of our concerns.
[51:59.500 --> 52:03.300]  And I mean, yeah, we do need to find someone.
[52:03.300 --> 52:05.780]  And I wish I had the time.
[52:05.780 --> 52:09.260]  But I know there are much more people out there, much more qualified
[52:09.260 --> 52:10.340]  to do something like that.
[52:10.340 --> 52:14.660]  And I would willingly back them 100 percent.
[52:15.180 --> 52:18.620]  Foxtrot's run CBD genetics and just me as a person, as an advocate.
[52:18.620 --> 52:20.940]  And I know Thursday's. Yeah, sure. Why not?
[52:22.780 --> 52:26.500]  Yeah, dude, someone's got to someone's got to teach them.
[52:26.500 --> 52:27.820]  But well, that's the thing.
[52:27.820 --> 52:29.060]  There needs to be education.
[52:29.060 --> 52:30.740]  These these guys have no education.
[52:30.740 --> 52:34.060]  They're basing all of their decisions on their emotions.
[52:34.060 --> 52:37.340]  And, you know, the people 50 year old argument, I would say
[52:37.780 --> 52:40.700]  to them, the most outdated medical information.
[52:41.100 --> 52:45.620]  Exactly. And what's happening is when you have maybe seven people come up
[52:45.780 --> 52:49.380]  and say no, and you have over 200 people
[52:49.380 --> 52:51.620]  willing to testify that they want something,
[52:52.420 --> 52:55.060]  you should be supporting the people that that want it.
[52:55.060 --> 52:58.540]  I mean, that's what the people want or it's not. It's fair.
[52:58.700 --> 53:04.340]  It's just it's it's insane to me that you can not even just hear or
[53:05.300 --> 53:08.820]  try to shelve it to make 200 people.
[53:08.820 --> 53:12.500]  I mean, was it less than 12 people that came up against it?
[53:12.500 --> 53:14.420]  I mean, it is 11. OK. Yeah.
[53:14.420 --> 53:18.380]  So less than a dozen people to like 200 people in a room, mostly veterans.
[53:18.380 --> 53:20.020]  So that was about 30 minutes.
[53:20.020 --> 53:22.260]  Yeah. Testimony in five hours.
[53:22.260 --> 53:24.620]  Yeah. Wow. Five hours of testimony.
[53:24.620 --> 53:27.980]  And even after all that, you know, you disrespect other veterans.
[53:27.980 --> 53:29.500]  You don't even acknowledge that you're a veteran.
[53:29.500 --> 53:34.020]  And then you sit there and you have these smart ass looks like
[53:34.340 --> 53:35.820]  wasn't one of them nodding off.
[53:35.820 --> 53:37.820]  Yeah, it looked like one. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[53:37.820 --> 53:38.980]  Yeah. Andrew called them out.
[53:38.980 --> 53:41.220]  I'm glad someone did because that would have made me furious.
[53:41.220 --> 53:42.340]  I would have thrown a shoe at that dude.
[53:42.340 --> 53:43.820]  I mean, that's it's ridiculous.
[53:43.820 --> 53:46.700]  You know, you got guys, girls, the job is to cry.
[53:46.740 --> 53:48.380]  Yeah. Your only job is to stay awake.
[53:48.380 --> 53:49.660]  This is your job.
[53:49.660 --> 53:51.780]  You're doing I mean, yeah. And they're all over 60.
[53:51.780 --> 53:53.700]  Well, most of them are 65.
[53:53.700 --> 53:55.860]  You know, they're going to be passing these little gyms.
[53:55.860 --> 53:58.340]  What's past? If you're over 50, it's time to leave office.
[53:58.340 --> 54:02.140]  Isn't there the right to redo the entire meeting since somebody fell asleep?
[54:02.140 --> 54:04.420]  There was a member not present for the 88.
[54:04.740 --> 54:07.020]  They didn't even represent deaf people there.
[54:07.300 --> 54:09.820]  You know, have a person that does sign language there.
[54:11.460 --> 54:13.740]  Who's good with the legal shit in Springs? Help us out here.
[54:13.740 --> 54:17.300]  Maybe that meeting can be totally redone since a city council member
[54:17.300 --> 54:18.620]  took a nap during the meeting.
[54:18.620 --> 54:20.260]  Maybe we need to redo on that whole thing.
[54:20.260 --> 54:22.420]  Maybe since there wasn't something there for deaf people
[54:22.700 --> 54:24.900]  so that they could hear and participate as well.
[54:24.900 --> 54:27.260]  Maybe we need to redo. Maybe we need to try that one over.
[54:27.420 --> 54:29.340]  We absolutely do. If you can, you guys.
[54:29.340 --> 54:32.220]  I'm curious to see how this second vote will go on.
[54:32.220 --> 54:33.820]  What's the one's the date?
[54:33.820 --> 54:35.620]  That's right. March 22nd.
[54:35.620 --> 54:37.700]  OK, can the public come to that one again?
[54:40.340 --> 54:43.340]  Yeah, they're not going to actually allow public comment on that one.
[54:43.340 --> 54:46.340]  So can I stand outside and look like we can protest?
[54:46.380 --> 54:50.340]  Yeah, protest actually is our best bet right now is to call
[54:50.340 --> 54:54.020]  like a massive amount of people and show people how unhappy we are.
[54:54.380 --> 54:57.900]  But I still don't think that that would actually sway their vote,
[54:57.900 --> 55:00.700]  but it would at least show them what they're doing is wrong.
[55:01.020 --> 55:02.780]  And we are starting to assemble.
[55:02.780 --> 55:03.460]  Yeah, exactly.
[55:03.460 --> 55:07.660]  That we are active and that we can we can actually change the face of politics
[55:07.660 --> 55:10.100]  in Colorado Springs and we can get them out of office.
[55:11.700 --> 55:13.300]  You know, I'm sorry.
[55:13.300 --> 55:13.860]  Go ahead, brother.
[55:13.860 --> 55:15.740]  I've just seen it done in Denver.
[55:15.740 --> 55:19.300]  You know, I've I've hiked up to the Capitol plenty of times to
[55:20.580 --> 55:23.420]  stop this shit, for lack of better words.
[55:23.740 --> 55:27.140]  They've so many of those that they've tried to pass with children
[55:27.140 --> 55:32.060]  not being able to medicate on school grounds, them trying to CPS,
[55:32.060 --> 55:38.620]  trying to say that any parent with a red card was, you know, basically,
[55:39.420 --> 55:42.820]  you know, endangering, endangering their child.
[55:42.820 --> 55:46.140]  You know, if they had just a whole bunch of shit that we've had to go through.
[55:46.460 --> 55:50.140]  So I feel like in the Springs, first of all, educating people
[55:50.140 --> 55:52.420]  about what's going on, just like we did in Denver
[55:53.580 --> 55:56.740]  and bringing making people aware of everything.
[55:56.740 --> 56:00.180]  And then, like I like Matt said, getting people together
[56:00.180 --> 56:04.020]  to actually show that we can be the face of change.
[56:04.380 --> 56:05.660]  We do need that down here.
[56:05.660 --> 56:07.740]  These clubs are essential.
[56:07.740 --> 56:10.460]  Limiting that plant count is absolute bullshit.
[56:11.460 --> 56:14.300]  I've been getting phone calls nonstop from these parents
[56:14.300 --> 56:16.700]  that are freaking out about that and patients that are freaking out
[56:16.700 --> 56:21.140]  because they're actively growing anywhere from, you know, whatever.
[56:21.300 --> 56:24.740]  You know, 24 to 36 to 60 plants, you know, whatever the case is,
[56:24.740 --> 56:27.260]  depending on their needs, without a problem,
[56:27.260 --> 56:29.300]  without there ever being overages or stacks.
[56:29.300 --> 56:31.540]  And sometimes they still come short up for their medicine
[56:31.780 --> 56:34.220]  when it comes time to be processed, even with that many plants,
[56:34.220 --> 56:36.380]  depending on what they grow and how they grow.
[56:36.380 --> 56:40.020]  So I just think it's insane for an Olympic city
[56:40.620 --> 56:46.820]  to talk about limiting what patients can and cannot grow and how they can.
[56:47.220 --> 56:51.460]  It just upsets me so much that that also wasn't talked about enough.
[56:51.460 --> 56:54.300]  That wasn't, you know, the focus on the club
[56:54.500 --> 56:55.740]  is equally important.
[56:55.740 --> 56:59.380]  But I feel like they're sliding one in with the other and that's horseshit.
[56:59.660 --> 57:01.340]  And that needs to be addressed more.
[57:01.340 --> 57:05.060]  And I feel like within the group of everyone that's for the clubs
[57:05.060 --> 57:09.260]  and I don't think enough people are aware about these plant counts.
[57:09.260 --> 57:12.780]  If I if we bring both these groups of people together
[57:12.780 --> 57:16.380]  that have this the same invested interest, I think we'd have a greater showing.
[57:16.380 --> 57:18.900]  And that's just, you know, my personal opinion.
[57:18.900 --> 57:22.300]  So I'm more than happy to reach out to the people that I know
[57:22.300 --> 57:25.660]  that are really coming at me and are distraught about them,
[57:25.660 --> 57:27.860]  you know, cutting down the residential plant count.
[57:28.100 --> 57:31.220]  And obviously, you know, we know all the veterans and all our friends
[57:31.220 --> 57:35.060]  and all our colleagues that are in this business and are for these clubs
[57:35.060 --> 57:36.820]  that are doing amazing things in the community.
[57:36.820 --> 57:37.740]  Let's get together.
[57:37.740 --> 57:41.540]  This is the only way we're going to make a change is to put any little thing
[57:41.540 --> 57:45.260]  aside and come together so we can actually show them the real numbers
[57:45.260 --> 57:47.180]  and the real faces of the people that they're affecting.
[57:47.180 --> 57:50.740]  Should you think we'd be so bold to show them, give them
[57:50.740 --> 57:54.260]  maybe a preview of what's going to happen if they ban these clubs on the 22nd?
[57:54.900 --> 57:58.580]  Let's say we get a thousand people out there by city council and just smoke it up.
[57:58.940 --> 58:00.140]  Let's show them what happens.
[58:00.140 --> 58:03.260]  You know, if you can't vote, you know, civil disobedience.
[58:03.500 --> 58:04.500]  Sometimes it works.
[58:04.500 --> 58:07.500]  Maybe this is I mean, that might be what it takes to show them.
[58:07.500 --> 58:09.300]  I mean, we want our clubs.
[58:09.300 --> 58:13.740]  We don't want to do this, but maybe this is an example.
[58:13.740 --> 58:15.740]  We need to say, where does that lead us and how?
[58:15.740 --> 58:18.740]  OK, so and that was something I don't know if it was you
[58:18.740 --> 58:20.740]  or somebody else brought a point up about Manitou
[58:21.060 --> 58:26.180]  and then being in the same El Paso County and them allowing recreational cannabis.
[58:26.380 --> 58:28.780]  Do they have clubs in Manitou or not?
[58:28.780 --> 58:29.980]  Not that I'm aware of.
[58:29.980 --> 58:35.980]  OK, so I just don't understand how you're going to allow these different assets.
[58:35.980 --> 58:38.820]  You know, these even with medical, like medical dispensaries,
[58:38.820 --> 58:40.700]  we have a ton down here in the springs.
[58:40.700 --> 58:44.340]  We have a ton of places where medical and recreational patients can go
[58:44.620 --> 58:47.580]  and be taken care of.
[58:48.140 --> 58:49.980]  And then where do they go?
[58:49.980 --> 58:50.980]  That's just the truth of it.
[58:50.980 --> 58:52.340]  That's that option.
[58:52.340 --> 58:55.180]  Why are you setting up your oh, the police chiefs?
[58:55.220 --> 58:59.100]  I mean, just to not to jump on my note, but he came in the room and basically said,
[59:00.140 --> 59:02.780]  this is this is not enforceable.
[59:02.780 --> 59:05.900]  So and that being said,
[59:06.340 --> 59:09.540]  that's coming from the words of the police chief of our city,
[59:09.700 --> 59:14.020]  basically telling us that there's really no way for them to be able to enforce this.
[59:14.020 --> 59:16.420]  Didn't he say he put in 900 hours of man?
[59:16.420 --> 59:20.260]  Nine thousand hours, nine thousand investigating these clubs
[59:20.260 --> 59:22.500]  and still is unable to bring a single
[59:22.500 --> 59:25.900]  that could have sent off a kid to college and whatever it was in our tax money.
[59:25.940 --> 59:29.060]  Like I'm just saying like how many nine thousand hours
[59:29.060 --> 59:32.140]  divided by 40 hour other cops for our work week?
[59:32.700 --> 59:34.460]  How many cops was that for?
[59:34.460 --> 59:36.580]  How much time? Holy crap. Yeah.
[59:36.580 --> 59:39.500]  Yeah. For one club, citizens of Colorado Springs, you paid for that.
[59:39.620 --> 59:40.860]  Yeah. And guess what?
[59:40.860 --> 59:42.340]  That was your money, guys.
[59:42.340 --> 59:46.060]  Our money. No charges brought nine thousand hours.
[59:47.260 --> 59:49.260]  At a cop's wage.
[59:49.260 --> 59:51.980]  So that's what you guys paid for them to come and hang out
[59:51.980 --> 59:54.580]  at one of these clubs with us and try to mingle. Yeah.
[59:55.180 --> 59:56.500]  And they still don't understand.
[59:56.500 --> 59:58.980]  They probably came here and got stoned and hung out and had a great ass time.
[59:58.980 --> 01:00:01.660]  I think so. Yeah. Watch cartoons and eat pizza.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.740]  But yeah, so that's also it creates a little confusion
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.620]  because you have the council saying one thing.
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:14.820]  Police chief is telling you another citizen saying a completely different thing.
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.540]  Yeah. No one's being heard.
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:19.780]  You have a couple.
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:22.140]  They're pushing their own agendas. Yeah.
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.820]  And it's all about what the police isn't going to enforce it.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.100]  And the citizens obviously want it.
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:30.180]  It's only a matter of time
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.900]  when that wall breaks and we just keep pushing forward.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.580]  Yeah. So there you go.
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:36.580]  Well, I have a question for Camille.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:40.500]  If now that they've done this, they've given you eight years to recoup your funds
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:42.580]  and there's no regulation.
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.740]  Doesn't that reopen the black market?
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:45.660]  Can it?
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:47.740]  I wasn't there.
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:49.900]  Encourages the Craigslist seller.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:56.740]  It encourages deals going on behind in parks, behind schools and parking lots.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.140]  That's what that encourages.
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:03.820]  Now we have tourists, like I said, jumping on Craigslist,
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:07.100]  looking for 420 weed, marijuana.
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.220]  These are things that were brought up at the meeting
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.740]  for the licensing with K.
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.940]  Ruppe and Jonathan Singer.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:19.260]  So they're just not thinking it through like at all, huh?
[01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:20.460]  That's all about it.
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.980]  It's all about the outside image, even though you can see through it.
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:27.180]  It's all about what it brings to other cities or other businesses
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:29.260]  that may want to come to this city.
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.620]  It's a very military town.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:34.820]  There's a lot of military influence here and and church influence and church.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.700]  Yeah, both. Yeah.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.940]  I mean, we're kind of a area.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.100]  They want to keep that image.
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.580]  They don't want to look like Pueblo or Denver.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:45.460]  They want to have that clean military churchy feel.
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.980]  Yeah, unfortunately, the data goes the other way.
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:52.180]  After they legalized marijuana,
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:55.700]  soldiers pissing hot actually went down.
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:59.100]  So it went in the opposite direction.
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.660]  Now that it's legal, it's no fun.
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.380]  Yeah, now they know it works.
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.380]  Now they're just going to wait.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:04.980]  Oh, OK.
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.060]  They get out and then they're going to use it
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.020]  without having to use it and get in trouble.
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.820]  Yeah, they'll do their.
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:14.020]  You know, and that's how most veterans that I know even felt
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:18.780]  being out of state, out of medical states, as you know, they do their time.
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.820]  They're you know, they serve their tour, whatever the case is, and come back
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:26.940]  and medicate and be done with the whole thing, grow in their beard and be happy.
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.540]  You know, grow in the beard.
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:29.580]  That's when you come to Colorado.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.700]  Yeah. You know why?
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.020]  Fuck it up while you're working.
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:36.180]  You know, if your employer says you can't, then obviously that's the rule of the game.
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.900]  If that's how you're getting your money,
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:40.620]  you know, if that's what's paying for your school, why jeopardize it?
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:44.620]  You know, I know more people that think about it that way than the other.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:45.700]  But at the same time,
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:49.180]  that's also asking someone not to medicate.
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:53.780]  And that's a very hard choice that people have to make to make all those decisions.
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:57.940]  So, you know, it's a double edged sword on that thought, you know.
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:06.300]  But to that thought of this place being a church, heavy military town.
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:13.060]  Dude, I know more housewives than girls I know that consume cannabis.
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:16.020]  You know, that's such a closeted thing in this community.
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.220]  It's really funny.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.740]  What is it? That show Weeds?
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:19.740]  Yeah.
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.980]  Oh, you know.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:26.460]  The biggest growing demographic of weed smokers is above 55.
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.420]  Nice. Yeah.
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.820]  People that are retired, trying to relax.
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.340]  Elderly people are flocking to Colorado in order to retire
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.380]  because they want to smoke weed when they retire.
[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:36.380]  That's great.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.380]  They'll deal with the snow as long as they can get high.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:43.100]  We get a ton of tourists who become members who are definitely older,
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.420]  just kind of want the experience, ask questions like,
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:48.260]  well, what does a gram look like?
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:50.140]  What is a dab?
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.700]  What what are people saying?
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:54.700]  This thing called a salvia or sativa.
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.580]  What does that mean?
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.780]  It's just educating these people.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:02.020]  They really just want to experience it for the first time.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:03.460]  Like, that's awesome.
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:06.300]  It's great to have people like you here to invite those people
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.500]  into the community and welcome and show them how it's done.
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.780]  Oh, yeah. With welcoming arms.
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.500]  Yeah, totally.
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:14.380]  Yeah. So you're here half the time, Kabuki,
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.500]  to share in the conversation.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.500]  Right. Yeah.
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.620]  No, it's folks.
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:22.140]  Yeah. Most of those people are profoundly grateful that these places exist.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.060]  You know, they I mean, and it showed that the other night,
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:27.060]  I mean, a lot of them broke down into tears.
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.660]  Otherwise, you got people that just bought their first medicine
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.300]  or their first cannabis, their first stab there in their car.
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.060]  So first marijuana.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.100]  Yeah. First marijuana. First marijuana.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.140]  Trying to have you guys seen that?
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:40.220]  There's a documentary where the dudes like the bottom of the pipe.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.700]  Oh, yeah. Like crack. Yeah.
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:44.700]  Yeah. You're I mean, you go home and try that.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.540]  You don't know what you're doing.
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:46.940]  Like that's your brand new.
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:50.540]  You think I get I get the glass hot and somebody here will definitely show you
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:54.740]  how to tell the difference between going into a dispensary
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.700]  and talking to some chick that has big tits and has no education on
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.700]  what strain does, what or this or that.
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.700]  She's just there because she's like, oh, look at it.
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:05.860]  Well, you know, that falls up to management, you know, and they're right.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.940]  To that regard, I will say I love the springs,
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:13.940]  that there are a lot of places here that have good educated bartenders.
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:16.780]  And I don't you go into a club like this.
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:19.580]  It's a different vibe. More education. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.180]  And there's also another issue.
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:24.420]  I mean, if you get you get a 21 year old kid, you know,
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:29.380]  would you rather him go to a bar where a bartender can sit there and monitor him
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:31.740]  and then cut him off when he's had enough?
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:36.500]  Or would you rather him go to a liquor store and go home with a bottle of vodka
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:40.300]  and get himself stupid drunk and end up destroying something
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:43.580]  or getting behind the wheel and destroying somebody? Yeah.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.700]  I'd rather him be at a cannabis club, not drinking.
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:52.340]  If he were my son sitting on the couch, intellectual conversation,
[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.860]  listening to laid back music.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:56.700]  The worst thing that's going to happen is they might fall asleep on the couch
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.660]  and get a little. Yeah, that does happen.
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:01.780]  And when I see people do that at these clubs,
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:04.060]  members might not offer whatever the case is.
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.980]  None of these club owners wake them up rudely to leave or, you know,
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:09.940]  it's not about a turnkey spot thing.
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:13.540]  And they rest there comfortably until they're comfortable enough to wake up.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:16.420]  And, you know, they make sure they're OK, they're hydrated.
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:19.580]  Every club I've been to has literally had that mentality.
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:22.380]  And I point that out to people because people don't know
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:25.700]  and they assume that it runs like something that's not.
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.380]  I like to take huge dabs.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:32.380]  And sometimes when I take a giant dab here before I can blow it all the way out,
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.340]  somebody's got a bottle of water in my face.
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:36.100]  Like you're going to need this, bro.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.340]  People look out for each other.
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.020]  Absolutely. It's a great thing.
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:41.260]  That's awesome to hear. Yeah.
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.340]  You never have to cough more than once or twice before someone's got water for you.
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.300]  And they're free.
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.020]  So, yeah, if you're thirsty and need a couch and a dab,
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.380]  it's a great spot here for you.
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:54.460]  And the mixture of people is always great here, too.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.660]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.820]  I got dreadlocks down to my butt and I'm sitting next to a veteran.
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.980]  So it's awesome. Like, I love it.
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:04.020]  The community is unmatched.
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.780]  Definitely. Two dreads, some veterans, a guy from Miami.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.380]  Yep. Our new friend over here.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.260]  It's a great mix.
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:14.540]  This is honestly I've done several podcasts away from my home studio.
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:16.780]  And this is my favorite that I've done on another couch.
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:18.060]  Awesome. Yeah.
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:20.740]  The podcast here, oh, is awesome.
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:22.420]  My favorite folks, one of my new favorite friends.
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:24.940]  So this is awesome. Thank you, guys.
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.860]  To the listeners, when it comes time, though, let's be proactive.
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:31.500]  It's time if you're in Colorado and you do not have rules on social clubs,
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:35.260]  it's time for you or your nerdy friend that's involved in the politics.
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.900]  You know who he is. He's in every group.
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:39.100]  Get him to those that one guy, Mike.
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.460]  That's you in Pueblo, bro.
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:44.660]  Get your guys together and start making rules for social smoke clubs
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.500]  in your city before they get bad.
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.460]  To be proactive. Put that out there.
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:52.100]  I don't know exactly the steps on how to do that, but one of your friends does.
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:55.380]  Knows how to create an initiative, knows how to get a petition started.
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:56.780]  They know how to get it going.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.540]  That's probably you in your group, right, Matt?
[01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:02.300]  Exactly. Veterans for natural rights basically exist to push policy.
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:08.660]  We defend all kinds of natural individual rights,
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:11.540]  such as the right to medicate yourself the way you please.
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:13.740]  Also, veterans rights.
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:19.100]  Any other individual right that has to do with freedom and liberty.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.820]  The right to safe access medicine.
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:25.540]  Safe access of medicine is the primary one that we lobby on here in Colorado
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:27.620]  because it is such a big issue here.
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.940]  This is a new industry.
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:32.100]  It's forming and it's the Wild West.
[01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:34.860]  You know, there's there's no real regulation.
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:36.220]  It's being crafted right now.
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:39.540]  We're setting policy and everyone's eyes are on us.
[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:40.820]  We are the revolution.
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:41.940]  Yes, indeed. To be a part of it.
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:43.460]  Thanks for standing up for it with us.
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.300]  Well, it's I'm proud to do so.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.380]  Thank you. Thank you.
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:52.660]  So now also, if you are in a state that has not gone legal with cannabis yet,
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:55.620]  start if you're writing the rules to create medical
[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:57.900]  and or recreational cannabis in your state.
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:01.260]  Be sure to include these social clubs.
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:03.100]  Make sure they can be open.
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:04.540]  Make sure that they exist.
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.660]  Make sure they're regulated in a fair way.
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:10.940]  Make it. I recommend that you make it to where these places have a grow
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:13.420]  to where these social clubs have a grow attached to them
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:16.940]  that can provide the product to this place would be ideal, in my opinion,
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.980]  or at least a private grower.
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:21.420]  Right. That has like an overabundance.
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:24.780]  They want to offload their their extra.
[01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:26.660]  They should be able to do that.
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:30.780]  I mean, we should be able to stimulate and stabilize the economy
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:32.580]  in every shape and way and manner.
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:34.620]  I mean, it only makes sense to do that.
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:38.860]  And by blocking that, we're just blocking, you know, really good medicine
[01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:41.340]  that otherwise could be shared all over the city.
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.860]  How many potholes did you guys hit on the way over here?
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:45.500]  Oh, shit. Yeah. Right.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:49.580]  Under the new world, every six months in Colorado Springs because of the potholes.
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.820]  If we could kind of do proper things with the tax money,
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:55.380]  yeah, generate proper tax revenue to places like this,
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:56.740]  we could fix some of the damn potholes.
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:57.420]  No, absolutely.
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.020]  Pothole could be filled with pot.
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.860]  Yep. Fill those potholes with pot money.
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:01.460]  Let's do it.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:02.380]  Absolutely. Potholes.
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:03.100]  What it's for.
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.740]  I want to give a shout out to Rhode Island.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.900]  I was told that in Rhode Island,
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:10.900]  the dispensaries are going to open without grows attached.
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:14.220]  And the grows will be done by guys like you and I that know how to grow.
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.380]  And we can take it to the dispensaries and legally sell it to them.
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:21.460]  That's how they're going to get to Jackson, Rhode Island next year.
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.580]  I started this game and so they do it.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:26.300]  And I got in the game here.
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:28.420]  Yeah. Somewhat. Get it tested.
[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:30.140]  You do three three sheets of paper.
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:32.620]  You get it tested and then you can go and sell it in any dispenser.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:33.860]  That is sweet. Yeah, it's a little.
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:35.380]  That's only fair. Yeah.
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:39.180]  Little known fact that every last grower,
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:43.380]  the top notch growers in Colorado, they they're not at dispensaries.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:44.460]  No, they're independent guys.
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:47.420]  They're independent guys who are running their own grows
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:51.020]  and they're growing the best medicine in the entire state,
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:53.060]  in the entire country, in the entire world.
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:58.380]  Right. All the best growers I know are independent growers or breeders
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:01.740]  or not working for the love.
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.940]  Yeah. And it's very rare.
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:08.180]  Maybe you, I guess, like I'm Jeff, you're the first thing I'm trying.
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.580]  I run a small grow.
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:11.340]  I've got a very small grow that I breed a lot in.
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:15.060]  Mostly I'm trying to bring that quality to this large facility.
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:17.300]  I'm running the green and healthy wellness grow now.
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:19.140]  Eighty five flowering lights.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.380]  I see why the quality falls off a little bit.
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.140]  It's a lot of stuff to manage. It's a new environment.
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:28.980]  You can't just throw up a 14000 BTU air conditioner, a couple of blowers,
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.020]  a fan and go and play off.
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.260]  You got to put in tons of air conditioning.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.180]  You have to have ducting for days.
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:37.820]  There are miles of PVC tubing in that grow.
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:43.340]  I use one room uses a thousand gallons of water a day.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:47.900]  If I mix one of those tanks off, imagine the amounts of nutrients I'm mixing.
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:51.820]  There's one thousand seven hundred and fifty milliliters of one nutrient
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.740]  that goes in there and I'm using five or six different things.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:57.540]  If I mess one of those up, imagine the catastrophe.
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:58.300]  No, of course.
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:11:59.900]  Thousands of dollars. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:02.900]  So they're trying to bring that level of quality to that playing field.
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:04.260]  It's a true challenge.
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.060]  No, absolutely.
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:07.340]  And a lot of people don't take any of those things into account.
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:08.980]  They don't. We brought that up. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:13.780]  So, yeah, that's definitely the I see why the small boutique grows
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:15.820]  are preferred and beneficial.
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:18.580]  It's hard to get this stuff going on in a big facility like that.
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.220]  Oh, yeah, I'll get it there. I promise.
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:21.580]  Oh, for sure, man. Absolutely.
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.500]  And you're doing most of it solo, right?
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:27.540]  I can take probably 78 percent credit for it.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.940]  In the first run at the new grow, the ladies helped a lot.
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.220]  Shout out to Damsel and Haley.
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.300]  They did give me a lot of help.
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.340]  John Hunt is in there as often as he can.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:39.660]  And then I have a crew of a few dudes that come occasionally and do
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:42.860]  if I need things that I just can't handle by myself, they do de-leafing.
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:46.540]  So I could take like 75, 80 percent credit for it.
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:47.340]  That's cool. Yeah.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.660]  And Hunt runs a lot of the bedroom for me. Nice.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.140]  That's nice, man.
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:52.580]  It's good to have an owner that's involved.
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:53.900]  I touch. Yeah, it is.
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.980]  It's great to have Hunt there and involved in helping me out.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.900]  But I touch every single plant every single day.
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:59.260]  Of course. Every single day.
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:01.100]  Those are my ladies. I love your babies.
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:02.780]  Yeah. You got to be there.
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:04.940]  I'm the first one in, last one out. Awesome.
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.580]  Yeah. That's great, man.
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.460]  Open and close the gate every day.
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:10.300]  I love what you do there, man. I'll keep supporting.
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.700]  Thank you. You get to dab the black cherry Kim live resin.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:16.180]  I did. I'm probably going to probably going to take another one before we do.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.180]  We're going to kill that.
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:19.500]  We're going to wrap up this podcast.
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.380]  This is one of my favorite podcasts I've ever done.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:23.380]  So I want to thank everybody for joining me. Thank you.
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:24.540]  Thank you, Jeff.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:26.100]  I hope to get everybody back.
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.900]  Fox, you and I want to do a show here.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:30.860]  We're going to get a live audience, maybe so we can.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:31.860]  That's right.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.980]  And ask questions.
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:36.300]  Yeah, we just need to get with Camille and your co-owner and set a date.
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.940]  Yeah. And we'll get that show going.
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:38.860]  That would be super fun.
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.620]  We'll try to get what's the maximum capacity here?
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:42.980]  Forty nine.
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:45.620]  So we're going to try to get forty nine people in this bitch.
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.900]  Oh, yeah. We're going to try.
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:50.220]  We'll invite people on Facebook and we'll do Instagram invites and we'll tell them.
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:52.540]  I think we could do that. Oh, yeah.
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:55.620]  We'll sit here on these couches and we'll talk about CBD for a little bit
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.820]  and then we'll let anybody in the audience that has a question
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.820]  grab a microphone and ask questions.
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:01.660]  And you and I can answer grow questions.
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:03.220]  Yeah. CBD questions live on the show.
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:04.900]  That'd be fun. It'll be great.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:06.260]  We'd appreciate the space.
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:07.780]  Of course. Any time.
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:10.340]  We'll have a bunch of stuff to give away that day.
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.100]  So, yeah. All right.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.180]  Matt, thanks again, everybody, for coming.
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:15.580]  Camille, thanks for letting us do this.
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:17.060]  Of course. Thanks for having me.
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:18.140]  This was a lot of fun.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:20.100]  I hope to do it again sometime.
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:20.620]  I can't wait.
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:24.220]  I'm going to get you on another show with Maddie and Carly.
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:26.620]  And we're going to talk about ladies in the cannabis industry.
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:28.140]  Yeah. Shout out to both of them.
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:28.980]  They're both awesome.
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:31.580]  Also, we're talking about badass ladies in the cannabis industry.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:33.300]  Big shout out to Jessica.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.220]  Yes. Yeah.
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.180]  She's one of the most famous cannabis ladies ever.
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.620]  There's so many cannabis ladies we could high five.
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:39.020]  Yeah. They're. Yeah.
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:40.540]  Shout out to all the badass.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.100]  Seriously. Can I say bitches?
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:43.860]  You can say cannabis bitches.
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:45.500]  Shout out to all the badass bitches out there.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.700]  All the good cannabis bitches.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:50.260]  That are just doing their thing with cannabis and that are educated on what they're doing.
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:52.740]  Absolutely. Very. Yeah.
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:53.780]  Yeah. Very cool.
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:54.980]  Not just out there shaking it.
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.860]  Shout out to girls who make cash.
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:58.380]  I love you all.
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.260]  Brittany Wagner, I think he's talking to you.
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:02.260]  Maybe.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:04.180]  All right. We're going to wrap up this podcast.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.620]  Has anybody got any final words?
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:08.300]  Well, you got a microphone in your hand and people are listening.
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.060]  Thank you, Jeff, for having us again.
[01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:12.220]  That was super awesome.
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:13.780]  Yeah. Can't wait for the next one.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:16.100]  Awesome. We're going to wrap it up like that.
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:17.260]  I'll be back to finish up the show.
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:19.620]  You guys hashtag run CBD.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:20.620]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:23.020]  I want to thank you guys for listening to that long episode.
