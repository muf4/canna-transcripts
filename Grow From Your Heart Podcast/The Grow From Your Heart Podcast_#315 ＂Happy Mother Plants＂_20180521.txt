[00:02.240 --> 00:05.640]  It's time for a bonus episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.640 --> 00:10.600]  It's Mother's Day, so this episode is dedicated to all you moms out there.
[00:10.600 --> 00:14.280]  Extra happy Mother's Day to my mom, happy Mother's Day to your mom, happy Mother's
[00:14.280 --> 00:18.720]  Day to every mom out there, and a little extra love to all the moms who are no longer with
[00:18.720 --> 00:19.720]  us.
[00:19.720 --> 00:23.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, this Mother's Day episode is going to be about mother plants.
[00:23.240 --> 00:26.280]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:26.280 --> 00:30.280]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:30.280 --> 00:31.760]  news, education, and conversation.
[00:31.760 --> 00:36.280]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:36.280 --> 00:40.500]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious
[00:40.500 --> 00:44.680]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:44.680 --> 00:46.920]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:46.920 --> 00:50.080]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:50.080 --> 00:54.040]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:54.040 --> 00:58.420]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:58.420 --> 01:01.880]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:01.880 --> 01:06.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[01:06.040 --> 01:10.480]  dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:10.480 --> 01:18.540]  All right, podcast world, let's talk about mother plants.
[01:18.540 --> 01:20.420]  What do I mean by a mother plant?
[01:20.420 --> 01:26.180]  A mother plant is a plant that I plan on keeping around perpetually and taking clones off of
[01:26.180 --> 01:28.860]  and using those clones for my production.
[01:28.860 --> 01:33.580]  I plan on keeping that mother plant in the mother area or the bedroom forever and not
[01:33.580 --> 01:34.980]  flowering her.
[01:34.980 --> 01:39.140]  And then I've got those genetics around so that I can always grow that same strain.
[01:39.140 --> 01:43.980]  Then I've got reliable clones of something that I've grown that is tested, tried and
[01:43.980 --> 01:44.980]  true.
[01:44.980 --> 01:45.980]  I know it's a female.
[01:45.980 --> 01:46.980]  I know the potency.
[01:46.980 --> 01:47.980]  I know how long to flower it.
[01:47.980 --> 01:48.980]  I know what to feed it.
[01:48.980 --> 01:50.140]  I know what not to do with it.
[01:50.140 --> 01:54.520]  So a mother plant is a plant you keep around with intentions of cutting clones from it
[01:54.560 --> 01:57.080]  and growing that strain over and over again.
[01:57.080 --> 02:01.640]  You can get a mother plant from just about any plant that you acquire.
[02:01.640 --> 02:04.920]  If it's tested and you like it, you can keep it as a mother plant.
[02:04.920 --> 02:06.680]  Maybe you got a clone from a dispensary.
[02:06.680 --> 02:08.420]  Maybe you got a clone from your friends.
[02:08.420 --> 02:10.560]  Maybe you grew out a seed and you really liked it.
[02:10.560 --> 02:15.120]  You can keep a clone of that alive forever and not flower it, and you can dedicate that
[02:15.120 --> 02:16.560]  as your mother plant.
[02:16.560 --> 02:22.000]  So let's talk about keeping mother plants and caring for your mother plant.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.600]  One of the first things is keeping your mother plant in good soil.
[02:25.600 --> 02:30.100]  I like to put them in decent soil, bagged soil from the grow store.
[02:30.100 --> 02:32.000]  You don't have to buy the most expensive soil.
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.160]  These aren't going to be super high performing plants.
[02:34.160 --> 02:35.640]  You just want to keep them healthy.
[02:35.640 --> 02:38.760]  I would add about 50% perlite.
[02:38.760 --> 02:42.240]  If what you're buying isn't well aerated, add some perlite to it.
[02:42.240 --> 02:44.320]  The big chunky perlite or the small perlite.
[02:44.320 --> 02:47.360]  As long as you're putting a lot of air in there, you will be okay.
[02:47.360 --> 02:53.440]  So decent soil or a soilless mix, like a peat based mix, with a lot of perlite for
[02:53.440 --> 02:54.440]  your mother plants.
[02:54.440 --> 02:55.840]  And then you want a semi big pot.
[02:55.840 --> 03:01.560]  I wouldn't go any smaller than a three gallon pot, probably a five or maybe a seven, but
[03:01.560 --> 03:03.440]  I know you don't have a lot of space.
[03:03.440 --> 03:06.320]  So if you have a three gallon, you're not going to be able to keep that mother plant
[03:06.320 --> 03:07.320]  around as long.
[03:07.320 --> 03:11.440]  You're going to have to clone it and replace it eventually.
[03:11.440 --> 03:15.160]  But if you can put it in a five, you can keep it alive for a little longer.
[03:15.160 --> 03:18.040]  It's going to start to get root bound and you're going to have to do something about
[03:18.040 --> 03:19.040]  that.
[03:19.040 --> 03:20.040]  Also, I like those air pots.
[03:20.040 --> 03:25.220]  Have you seen the pots that look like they are kind of like a waffle maker on the outside?
[03:25.220 --> 03:26.400]  Those are great for mother plants.
[03:26.400 --> 03:29.160]  You can open those up and you can prune those roots.
[03:29.160 --> 03:31.040]  We'll talk about that in a little bit.
[03:31.040 --> 03:36.160]  But I like a big pot, either an air pot or a root pot or a big pot for a mother plant,
[03:36.160 --> 03:39.600]  because that plant's going to grow large and you need to get it big enough to take however
[03:39.600 --> 03:41.520]  many clones your production is going to be.
[03:41.520 --> 03:44.400]  If it's six, because you're in Colorado, or I guess you'd be at five now because you've
[03:44.400 --> 03:47.020]  already got your mother, it limits you down to five.
[03:47.020 --> 03:50.960]  Or if you're going to run a production, you need to get that many clones off of these
[03:50.960 --> 03:51.960]  plants.
[03:51.960 --> 03:55.720]  So you're going to need a large pot to grow the plant as large as you need it.
[03:55.720 --> 03:58.600]  So we've got a large pot full of good soil with a bunch of perlite.
[03:58.600 --> 04:02.760]  Now you're going to want to put your plant under 18 to 24 hours of light.
[04:02.760 --> 04:06.240]  I like to have the mother plants under 18 to 24 hours of light.
[04:06.240 --> 04:09.600]  Some plants I've noticed, when they start to get root bound, if they get a little bit
[04:09.600 --> 04:14.240]  big and you've only got them under 18 or 20 hours of light, they will try to autoflower
[04:14.280 --> 04:15.280]  on you.
[04:15.280 --> 04:16.400]  They'll get mad that they're root bound.
[04:16.400 --> 04:21.680]  They'll get big enough and they'll think, hey, it is time for me to start flowering.
[04:21.680 --> 04:26.920]  So to prevent that, maybe have a larger pot and also keep it on 24 hours of light.
[04:26.920 --> 04:29.080]  A lot of people say that your plants need to sleep.
[04:29.080 --> 04:33.760]  A good compromise there is maybe 20 on and four off and see what starts to happen.
[04:33.760 --> 04:37.600]  If your plant starts to autoflower, if you see it making pistils, then it is time to
[04:37.600 --> 04:43.120]  put that plant on 24 hours of light and start feeding it a nice heavy veg nutrient with
[04:43.120 --> 04:44.400]  a lot of nitrogen.
[04:44.400 --> 04:48.720]  And then also maybe increase the amount of light that you're giving it and also the duration
[04:48.720 --> 04:49.720]  of light you're giving it.
[04:49.720 --> 04:53.920]  And that will bring it out of that flowering phase back to veg for you.
[04:53.920 --> 04:57.560]  So if they do start to autoflower, put them on 24 and keep them there.
[04:57.560 --> 05:01.580]  That's going to happen with more sativa dominant, more tropical type strains.
[05:01.580 --> 05:03.560]  They're not going to take as much light to flower.
[05:03.560 --> 05:06.600]  You may have to keep them on 24 hours of light.
[05:06.600 --> 05:12.860]  So 18 to 24, maybe 18 on six off, maybe 19 on five off, maybe 20 on four off, or maybe
[05:12.860 --> 05:17.020]  just go straight up 24 hours on and don't ever give them darkness.
[05:17.020 --> 05:18.540]  That is up to you.
[05:18.540 --> 05:20.140]  See what your plants respond to.
[05:20.140 --> 05:23.860]  Everything lights and likes time to sleep, but maybe your mother plants flower if you
[05:23.860 --> 05:27.300]  give them too much nap time, maybe just a couple hours will work for you.
[05:27.300 --> 05:30.260]  All right, so we've got big pots filled with good soil.
[05:30.260 --> 05:32.700]  We know how long to keep the light on.
[05:32.700 --> 05:36.940]  Let's talk a little bit about what to feed our mother plants.
[05:36.940 --> 05:40.980]  If you're using bottled nutrients, just a basic veg nutrients, if you've got the veg
[05:40.980 --> 05:45.500]  A, the veg B, use that at the recommended dosage.
[05:45.500 --> 05:48.740]  Every once a week or so, you're going to want to add some cow mag so you don't get any cow
[05:48.740 --> 05:52.100]  mag deficiencies and maybe add a little bit of kelp.
[05:52.100 --> 05:55.300]  And then when you're going to take clones, when you know that you're going to take clones
[05:55.300 --> 06:00.060]  in a couple of days, maybe spray them with a kelp product and that will help the plants
[06:00.060 --> 06:02.280]  with a little bit of vigor when you cut the clones.
[06:02.280 --> 06:06.540]  So basic veg nutrients, maybe some microbes to keep that root zone strong and everything
[06:06.540 --> 06:07.540]  growing fast.
[06:07.540 --> 06:12.180]  And then maybe a little bit of cow mag occasionally, and then some kelp with the feed and then
[06:12.180 --> 06:14.740]  maybe kelp as a foliar feed occasionally.
[06:14.740 --> 06:18.620]  All you really have to do is keep these plants strong and healthy.
[06:18.620 --> 06:22.260]  I wouldn't give them too much food because then they're going to grow too fast and they're
[06:22.260 --> 06:23.780]  going to get out of control.
[06:23.780 --> 06:28.980]  And that leads me into topping and shaping for the maximum amount of clones.
[06:28.980 --> 06:31.500]  You should be able to top plants at this point.
[06:31.500 --> 06:34.420]  If you've been listening to the podcast for a long time, we've talked about topping.
[06:34.420 --> 06:37.500]  If you're not sure on how to top a plant, I'll give a quick talk on it because you're
[06:37.500 --> 06:40.420]  going to need to know how to do this to make good mother plants.
[06:40.420 --> 06:44.100]  The first clone that you can take out of your plants is that main top.
[06:44.100 --> 06:45.460]  Your plant's going to grow up.
[06:45.460 --> 06:46.460]  It's going to branch out.
[06:46.460 --> 06:47.460]  It's going to grow taller.
[06:47.460 --> 06:48.460]  It's going to branch out again.
[06:48.460 --> 06:51.620]  Then that main top is going to get taller than everybody.
[06:51.620 --> 06:55.740]  Grab that main top and take it down, follow it down with your hand until you bend it over
[06:55.740 --> 06:57.900]  and it looks like you've got a nice even canopy.
[06:57.900 --> 07:02.900]  Toward the next four tops, the next four branches, they kind of come up to an even point.
[07:02.900 --> 07:07.160]  If you cut out that main top, you'll be able to see where you can create a nice even canopy
[07:07.160 --> 07:08.340]  of four big heads.
[07:08.340 --> 07:12.680]  You'll take out that one big main stock and you'll create four even tops.
[07:12.680 --> 07:16.420]  You've got a nice mother plant that's going to create four nice even tops.
[07:16.420 --> 07:18.080]  I like to clone that first one.
[07:18.080 --> 07:19.580]  That's where my first clone comes from.
[07:19.580 --> 07:21.100]  I put that in the cloner.
[07:21.100 --> 07:22.280]  I make that one root.
[07:22.280 --> 07:23.500]  I put it in a small pot.
[07:23.500 --> 07:26.020]  Then I flower that and I see what I've got.
[07:26.020 --> 07:28.140]  If that is a good plant, then I keep it.
[07:28.140 --> 07:31.220]  Then I've already got a mother plant ready to give me a bunch of clones for a production
[07:31.220 --> 07:32.220]  run.
[07:32.220 --> 07:35.660]  If it's a male, I can throw that one away and I can throw away the mother plant, which
[07:35.660 --> 07:37.860]  I guess would have been a father plant at that point.
[07:37.860 --> 07:39.980]  But it doesn't matter because they're going in the trash.
[07:39.980 --> 07:41.940]  If it was a problem, I throw that one away.
[07:41.940 --> 07:45.220]  I throw its corresponding donor plant away.
[07:45.220 --> 07:48.340]  That first clone is the one that makes me decide if I want to run that plant again or
[07:48.340 --> 07:52.180]  lets me know if I've got a boy or a girl or if I've got a problematic plant.
[07:52.180 --> 07:53.940]  It also starts shaping the plant.
[07:53.940 --> 07:57.340]  I've now taken the main stock out and I've started shaping that plant to be a little
[07:57.340 --> 07:58.340]  bit wider.
[07:58.340 --> 08:00.140]  So there's my first clone off of my mother plant.
[08:00.140 --> 08:04.180]  Now I like to go to the bottom and those bottom branches, not the weak, shitty ones,
[08:04.180 --> 08:08.140]  but the first ones that are kind of stout, that come up kind of far, those become my
[08:08.140 --> 08:09.540]  next two clones.
[08:09.540 --> 08:13.080]  So now I've got three clones already off of kind of a small mother plant.
[08:13.080 --> 08:16.940]  Now those three clones, at least one of those is going to live for me and then I'll have
[08:16.940 --> 08:18.540]  something to grow.
[08:18.540 --> 08:20.160]  Or sometimes I do the opposite.
[08:20.160 --> 08:24.260]  Sometimes I keep that clone as the next mother plant so that I've got something small to
[08:24.260 --> 08:25.660]  start so that I've got some time.
[08:25.660 --> 08:28.820]  I don't need it right away because I've already got a crop in progress, right?
[08:28.820 --> 08:32.500]  So I'll take the big plant that the clone came from and flower that big one since it's
[08:32.500 --> 08:33.840]  already so grown out.
[08:33.840 --> 08:37.660]  It kind of just depends on the situation and how much room I've got and what my goal is,
[08:37.660 --> 08:38.660]  which one I decide to keep.
[08:38.660 --> 08:41.960]  Either the clone or the grown out plant.
[08:41.960 --> 08:45.660]  Then I decide which one to flower based on my situation, but that's a good way to do
[08:45.660 --> 08:46.660]  it.
[08:46.660 --> 08:49.180]  But now I've got three clones off of a very small mother plant.
[08:49.180 --> 08:50.980]  Then you can let that plant grow.
[08:50.980 --> 08:54.140]  And as those bottom branches start growing out, they'll reach up to the tops and the
[08:54.140 --> 08:56.100]  tops will start reaching up to the lights.
[08:56.100 --> 08:58.100]  Take those tops out.
[08:58.100 --> 09:02.040]  So find the main, the top of the branch that you want to make a clone and follow it down
[09:02.040 --> 09:05.340]  with your fingers until you hit that intersection where there's a Y.
[09:05.340 --> 09:08.720]  And right where there are two branches coming out there, and you would cut out the peace
[09:08.720 --> 09:10.700]  sign part, the part that makes it a peace sign, right?
[09:10.700 --> 09:13.400]  If you follow your finger down, you're the middle of the peace sign, then you'll come
[09:13.400 --> 09:17.300]  to the intersection where two come up, then make the peace sign.
[09:17.300 --> 09:19.100]  Cut that middle of the peace sign out.
[09:19.100 --> 09:22.140]  And now you've got in the future, those two that are sticking up are going to become the
[09:22.140 --> 09:23.140]  next two tops.
[09:23.140 --> 09:25.540]  You turned that one top into two tops.
[09:25.540 --> 09:28.420]  And now you're multiplying the tops on your mother plant.
[09:28.420 --> 09:32.500]  Sometimes, if you've got extra time in the grow, even if you don't need clones and the
[09:32.500 --> 09:36.580]  plants are, those mother plants are getting tall, go through there and cut them at those
[09:36.580 --> 09:40.940]  intersections, top them and make a nice even hedge out of your mother plants and let them
[09:40.940 --> 09:41.940]  keep growing.
[09:41.940 --> 09:47.860]  And then when you do need clones off of one plant, you could be able to get 25, 50, maybe
[09:47.860 --> 09:53.020]  even 75 to a hundred clones off of one mother plant, depending on how big the plant is,
[09:53.020 --> 09:57.140]  what strain it is, what size pot it is, what kind of light you've got it under and how
[09:57.140 --> 09:59.460]  well you've been taking care of it.
[09:59.460 --> 10:02.900]  And that kind of leads me into the next part I want to talk about.
[10:02.900 --> 10:07.380]  The most important part about mother plants is just keeping them healthy and clean.
[10:07.380 --> 10:12.300]  You need healthy and clean mother plants because that is the foundation of your garden.
[10:12.300 --> 10:13.640]  Everything starts with those plants.
[10:13.640 --> 10:16.680]  If you've got spider mites on your mother plants, guess what?
[10:16.680 --> 10:18.300]  Your clones have spider mites.
[10:18.300 --> 10:20.000]  Now your veg plants will have spider mites.
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.720]  Now your flowering plants, before they even made it to the flower room, they already are
[10:23.720 --> 10:26.440]  problems and you're struggling from the very beginning.
[10:26.440 --> 10:30.680]  Also, if they're not healthy and you take clones, the clones are going to be weak.
[10:30.680 --> 10:32.120]  They're going to take longer to root.
[10:32.120 --> 10:33.660]  They're going to be more prone to disease.
[10:33.660 --> 10:35.640]  They're going to be more prone to powdery mildew.
[10:35.640 --> 10:36.760]  They're going to grow slower.
[10:36.760 --> 10:40.120]  You're not going to get the production that you deserve out of these plants.
[10:40.120 --> 10:42.920]  You're going to get everything dialed in and these plants are still going to grow like
[10:42.920 --> 10:46.880]  shit because the moms that they came from were not healthy.
[10:46.880 --> 10:48.680]  You're cutting the arm off of the plant.
[10:49.520 --> 10:50.520]  Just think about this.
[10:50.520 --> 10:53.520]  If you've got a bodybuilder and you cut the arm off of that bodybuilder and you stuck
[10:53.520 --> 10:56.880]  it into some shit that made it grow roots, you're going to have a big, fat, healthy bodybuilder
[10:56.880 --> 10:57.920]  arm to start with.
[10:57.920 --> 10:58.920]  It's going to grow strong.
[10:58.920 --> 10:59.920]  It's going to be able to lift weight.
[10:59.920 --> 11:01.280]  It's going to be able to push shit up.
[11:01.280 --> 11:02.360]  It's going to do well.
[11:02.360 --> 11:05.880]  If you take some Harry Potter arm and you cut it off and you stick it into some clone
[11:05.880 --> 11:07.600]  shit, you're going to have this toothpick arm.
[11:07.600 --> 11:09.120]  It's not going to make any weight.
[11:09.120 --> 11:10.840]  It's not going to be able to support anything.
[11:10.840 --> 11:13.760]  Wouldn't you rather start with a beefy bodybuilder arm?
[11:13.760 --> 11:17.440]  Start off with super healthy, super happy, clean, strong mother plants.
[11:17.440 --> 11:19.800]  That's one of the most important parts of a mother plant.
[11:19.800 --> 11:22.680]  Keep it pest and problem free.
[11:22.680 --> 11:26.640]  A lot of people overlook the importance of a healthy veg environment.
[11:26.640 --> 11:29.600]  The veg room is probably where you're keeping your mother plants.
[11:29.600 --> 11:33.880]  Spend the few extra bucks and make that room as top notch as your flower room.
[11:33.880 --> 11:36.320]  Everybody spends all the money on the bloom room.
[11:36.320 --> 11:38.820]  Don't forget the veg is super important.
[11:38.820 --> 11:40.160]  Don't overlook that step.
[11:40.160 --> 11:45.320]  All right, let's talk a little bit about the lighting that you can use for your mother
[11:45.320 --> 11:46.320]  plants.
[11:46.360 --> 11:48.240]  You can keep little tiny mother plants.
[11:48.240 --> 11:52.320]  If all you need is six clones, you can keep a little one gallon pot with a little tiny
[11:52.320 --> 11:55.320]  plant that gives you six little clones every time you need them.
[11:55.320 --> 11:59.440]  You can cut it back really tiny to where it's got one shoot on it and let that one shoot
[11:59.440 --> 12:02.160]  grow into six clones by the time you need it again.
[12:02.160 --> 12:04.680]  You can keep them real tiny or you can keep them real big.
[12:04.680 --> 12:05.720]  That's something I should mention.
[12:05.720 --> 12:07.180]  Let's talk about the lighting.
[12:07.180 --> 12:10.320]  You can keep them under a T5 if you don't want them to get too big.
[12:10.320 --> 12:14.160]  If you don't need giant mother plants, you could probably get plenty of clones by keeping
[12:14.160 --> 12:16.480]  your plants under a T5.
[12:16.480 --> 12:19.840]  If you don't want them to grow super fast, a T5 is ideal.
[12:19.840 --> 12:24.320]  If you've got a home grow where you just need clones every 60 days, you just need to cut
[12:24.320 --> 12:28.760]  them to replace the batch that you're going to cut down, a T5 would be perfect for you.
[12:28.760 --> 12:32.480]  A T5 could also work for you on a small commercial scale.
[12:32.480 --> 12:34.200]  You would just need a lot of them.
[12:34.200 --> 12:36.000]  Just have to spread the plants out a little bit more.
[12:36.000 --> 12:37.920]  They can't get as tall.
[12:37.920 --> 12:42.680]  Also 315s, the ceramic metal halides, you could use those for your mother plants.
[12:42.680 --> 12:44.600]  That would work just fine.
[12:44.600 --> 12:47.240]  Those are enough to keep the plants growing, keep them vegging.
[12:47.240 --> 12:49.560]  I would keep those on since they aren't as powerful.
[12:49.560 --> 12:54.080]  The T5s and the 315s, I would keep those on 24 hours a day just because you're going to
[12:54.080 --> 12:59.560]  need that much power to make sure they do not auto flower on you.
[12:59.560 --> 13:03.320]  The next light that I would recommend, maybe you could use an LED.
[13:03.320 --> 13:08.320]  I don't have any experience with LEDs, but the LEDs make veg plants go crazy.
[13:08.320 --> 13:12.400]  For mother plants, they would be highly productive.
[13:12.440 --> 13:15.480]  If you really want to step it up and you want to have larger mother plants and you want
[13:15.480 --> 13:20.200]  a lot of productivity so that you can make a lot of clones, I would say a 400 watt metal
[13:20.200 --> 13:23.120]  halide would be very productive.
[13:23.120 --> 13:26.820]  Also, the more light you're using, the healthier your plants are going to be.
[13:26.820 --> 13:29.640]  The spider mites come around less when the light is better.
[13:29.640 --> 13:32.400]  The plants get less problems when the light is stronger.
[13:32.400 --> 13:39.800]  T5s, the 315 ceramic metal halides, a good quality LED, or a 400 watt metal halide, you
[13:39.800 --> 13:43.640]  could use a 600 or 1000 watt metal halide if you wanted to.
[13:43.640 --> 13:46.800]  You could use a double ended Govita for a mother plant if you wanted to.
[13:46.800 --> 13:48.920]  However, those are kind of overkill.
[13:48.920 --> 13:54.280]  The lights I listed before are probably the most efficient for somebody with a home grow.
[13:54.280 --> 13:58.000]  Maybe a 400 watt for a commercial grow would be good enough.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.200]  So that's the lighting.
[13:59.200 --> 14:03.640]  All right, we know about soil, we know about pots, we know how long to run the lights.
[14:03.640 --> 14:07.580]  We learned about nutrients, we talked about how to top and shape the plants for production,
[14:07.580 --> 14:11.300]  we know to keep them healthy and keep the bugs away from the plants.
[14:11.300 --> 14:13.260]  We know what kind of lighting to use.
[14:13.260 --> 14:15.300]  Here's something we should talk about.
[14:15.300 --> 14:16.640]  Carefully label your mother plants.
[14:16.640 --> 14:21.940]  If you're going to have more than one mother plant, please carefully label it.
[14:21.940 --> 14:25.960]  There's nothing more frustrating than growing Stardog for seven weeks and realizing about
[14:25.960 --> 14:29.700]  seven weeks in that that's Romulan Kush and you've been thinking all this time that all
[14:29.700 --> 14:33.060]  those pictures you took were Stardog and all the hype you had in your head it was Stardog
[14:33.060 --> 14:35.200]  and it's not even fucking Stardog.
[14:35.200 --> 14:36.200]  That shit gets annoying.
[14:36.200 --> 14:42.560]  So make sure you label the plants very carefully, especially if you plan on giving clones out.
[14:42.560 --> 14:44.380]  You don't want to give out clones that are mislabeled.
[14:44.380 --> 14:48.480]  So if you're going to give out clones, please label your mother plant, label your clones
[14:48.480 --> 14:49.480]  properly.
[14:49.480 --> 14:53.040]  Here's something that I didn't write down that I want to mention.
[14:53.040 --> 14:54.960]  Pay attention to what you spray on your plants.
[14:54.960 --> 14:55.960]  This is your garden.
[14:55.960 --> 14:58.000]  You're allowed to spray what you would like.
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.200]  I would like if you were gentle and you didn't use ridiculous pesticides.
[15:02.200 --> 15:05.400]  But if you're going to give clones out from your mother plants, if you're going to give
[15:05.400 --> 15:09.520]  clones out to people, let those people know what you applied to your plants.
[15:09.520 --> 15:10.520]  Just be honest.
[15:10.520 --> 15:11.960]  Okay, don't lie to people.
[15:11.960 --> 15:13.200]  Don't try to hide it.
[15:13.200 --> 15:16.800]  Also, whatever you spray on these mother plants is going into your veg plants, which is going
[15:16.800 --> 15:18.580]  to end up in your flowering plants.
[15:18.580 --> 15:20.860]  So think about who is going to consume this product.
[15:20.860 --> 15:24.880]  If you've got a patient who has a compromised immune system, if you've got a patient with
[15:24.880 --> 15:28.680]  the lung problem, if you've got a patient who is allergic to something, keep that in
[15:28.680 --> 15:31.400]  mind when you were treating your mother plants for pesticides.
[15:31.400 --> 15:32.400]  All right.
[15:32.400 --> 15:33.400]  All right.
[15:33.400 --> 15:36.200]  I don't want to dwell on that all the time, but I want to keep people safe and clean.
[15:36.200 --> 15:37.760]  So where was I?
[15:37.760 --> 15:41.640]  Carefully label things, label your clones, be honest about the pesticides that are put
[15:41.640 --> 15:42.640]  on your mother plants.
[15:42.640 --> 15:46.600]  If you're going to share clones with people, then don't let your mother plants get root
[15:46.600 --> 15:47.600]  bound.
[15:47.600 --> 15:50.760]  If your plants start to get root bound, they may try to auto flower on you.
[15:50.760 --> 15:52.660]  That's one of the things that will trigger that.
[15:52.660 --> 15:55.320]  If they get root bound, you've got a couple of options.
[15:55.320 --> 15:57.440]  You can either up pot to a larger pot.
[15:57.440 --> 16:00.200]  If you're in a one gallon pot, put it in a three gallon pot.
[16:00.200 --> 16:01.200]  It's not that hard.
[16:01.200 --> 16:03.060]  I'm sure you know how to up pot.
[16:03.060 --> 16:06.540]  You fill the pot about halfway, you pull the pot off of the old dirt.
[16:06.540 --> 16:08.060]  It's probably fucking real tight.
[16:08.060 --> 16:10.940]  You just got to squeeze that pot off, turn it upside down and shake it.
[16:10.940 --> 16:14.780]  Get that pot off the dirt, set it right in the new dirt and fill it up with soil, pat
[16:14.780 --> 16:18.140]  it into where it's kind of snug and then feed it with good nutrients.
[16:18.140 --> 16:19.140]  You've just up potted.
[16:19.140 --> 16:20.140]  Now you're into a bigger pot.
[16:20.140 --> 16:21.680]  It won't be root bound.
[16:21.680 --> 16:24.940]  Something I would recommend if you've got a root bound plant and you're trying to up
[16:24.940 --> 16:27.800]  pot it, maybe crunch those roots up a little bit.
[16:27.800 --> 16:30.860]  If they're all bound up, just put your fingers in there and just crunch them up and spread
[16:30.860 --> 16:31.860]  them apart.
[16:31.860 --> 16:35.140]  That will encourage them to spread and stop them from growing into a ball.
[16:35.140 --> 16:37.620]  So if they're up, if they're root bound, up pot them.
[16:37.620 --> 16:39.500]  Or you can learn how to root prune.
[16:39.500 --> 16:40.900]  I am scared of root pruning.
[16:40.900 --> 16:42.180]  That is not something I do.
[16:42.180 --> 16:45.220]  If you're going to root prune, get yourself a pot that will air prune.
[16:45.220 --> 16:47.140]  It'll be a lot easier.
[16:47.140 --> 16:51.400]  Or your other option, you can simply clone off of your mother plant.
[16:51.400 --> 16:52.940]  You can make a bunch of clones.
[16:52.940 --> 16:56.780]  And as soon as you have one of them rooted and into some soil, you can just either throw
[16:56.780 --> 17:00.220]  that big mother plant away or you can flower it.
[17:00.220 --> 17:03.460]  If it's got a decent shape, if you haven't fucked it up by taking so many clones off
[17:03.460 --> 17:07.280]  of it, a lot of times you guys, your mother plants are going to start to get this ridiculous
[17:07.280 --> 17:09.780]  shape to them because you've been taking so many clones.
[17:09.780 --> 17:11.500]  Some of the OG Kush plants grow like shit.
[17:11.500 --> 17:14.740]  So no matter what you do, they're going to just start getting a weird shape.
[17:14.740 --> 17:16.860]  You're going to have to re mom them.
[17:16.860 --> 17:21.320]  There's no crime in taking a bunch of clones, selecting your favorite clone and restarting
[17:21.320 --> 17:23.420]  that one as your new mother plant.
[17:23.420 --> 17:26.440]  Then you can take that old one, you can cut it down, you can cut a bunch of clones off
[17:26.440 --> 17:29.400]  of it and donate them to your friends, or you could just throw it away.
[17:29.400 --> 17:33.560]  Or if it's in good shape, like I said, you can flower that old mother plant.
[17:33.560 --> 17:36.760]  A lot of times I just cut them down and throw them away because they're already a wonky
[17:36.760 --> 17:38.920]  shape that's not worth working with them.
[17:38.920 --> 17:43.400]  Just get as many clones as you can, and then just cut it down and let it go.
[17:43.400 --> 17:46.440]  A lot of people are going to say, what about genetic drift?
[17:46.440 --> 17:51.520]  I do not think that genetic drift would be a problem if you were taking care of your
[17:51.520 --> 17:53.080]  mother plants properly.
[17:53.080 --> 17:57.560]  If the mother, this is why I talked about keeping strong, healthy, problem free mother
[17:57.560 --> 17:58.560]  plants.
[17:58.720 --> 18:01.880]  If the mother plants are healthy, and the clones are done properly, and everything is
[18:01.880 --> 18:04.400]  cared for, there will not be genetic drift.
[18:04.400 --> 18:10.760]  I have had my clone of Flo since 2007 or 2008.
[18:10.760 --> 18:12.440]  I have had the same plant.
[18:12.440 --> 18:14.840]  It's not the same plant, but it's the same clone.
[18:14.840 --> 18:19.240]  I have regenerated that clone several times because it's gotten too big.
[18:19.240 --> 18:22.040]  Imagine over eight years how big that fucking clone has gotten.
[18:22.040 --> 18:27.820]  I've had to re-clone it several times, probably eight times, probably keep it probably twice
[18:27.820 --> 18:28.820]  a year.
[18:28.820 --> 18:32.820]  It's probably been 16 generations through, and I just posted a picture of Flo today,
[18:32.820 --> 18:34.540]  and she is still beautiful.
[18:34.540 --> 18:36.240]  I don't really worry about genetic drift.
[18:36.240 --> 18:40.740]  We don't worry about it in the commercial industry, because if it's done properly, genetic
[18:40.740 --> 18:42.660]  drift has not been a problem.
[18:42.660 --> 18:44.940]  I've been in the commercial industry for several years now.
[18:44.940 --> 18:46.580]  I've been through several facilities.
[18:46.580 --> 18:51.300]  I've ran my clone, like I said, for eight years, and it's still beautiful.
[18:51.300 --> 18:53.660]  Genetic drift shouldn't be a problem if things are done properly.
[18:53.660 --> 18:57.900]  You guys, I feel like that was a quick, good, useful rundown on mother plants.
[18:57.900 --> 19:00.380]  I feel like we covered all the things we need to cover.
[19:00.380 --> 19:01.380]  We covered soil.
[19:01.380 --> 19:02.440]  We covered pot size.
[19:02.440 --> 19:04.000]  We covered light schedule.
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.760]  We talked about shaping your plant.
[19:05.760 --> 19:10.500]  We talked about strong veg nutrients and a little bit of cow mag, maybe some kelp.
[19:10.500 --> 19:13.200]  We talked about keeping the plants healthy and clean.
[19:13.200 --> 19:15.540]  Don't be afraid to go in and pick off the bottom stuff.
[19:15.540 --> 19:19.060]  If it starts getting funky because it's not getting enough light, pick off that crap on
[19:19.060 --> 19:21.420]  the bottom, that little frilly crap, the pubes.
[19:21.420 --> 19:22.420]  Go ahead and pick them right off.
[19:22.420 --> 19:23.500]  Yeah, I call them the pubes.
[19:23.500 --> 19:25.100]  I'm sorry.
[19:25.100 --> 19:26.180]  We talked about lighting.
[19:26.180 --> 19:28.680]  You don't need the strongest lights on the planet for your mother plants.
[19:28.680 --> 19:30.180]  You just need to keep them growing.
[19:30.180 --> 19:33.460]  Of course, the more light you give them, the healthier they will be, the more healthy they
[19:33.460 --> 19:37.300]  will be, whichever, and also the more clones you'll be able to take, but that's all about
[19:37.300 --> 19:40.540]  the size of your grow and your requirements.
[19:40.540 --> 19:41.980]  Carefully label all of your mother plants.
[19:41.980 --> 19:44.900]  If you've got more than one mother plant, please carefully label that.
[19:44.900 --> 19:48.780]  If you're going to give out clones, please carefully label those.
[19:48.780 --> 19:52.780]  Also, be honest about the pesticides that you're using on your mother plants because
[19:52.780 --> 19:56.460]  they're making it through the entire cycle.
[19:56.460 --> 19:57.460]  Don't let them get root bound.
[19:57.460 --> 20:01.300]  You're going to have to learn to up pot, root prune, or re-clone your mother plants.
[20:01.300 --> 20:06.060]  When you do so, if you re-clone, don't worry about genetic drift because Rasta Jeff says
[20:06.060 --> 20:09.340]  if you do it right, that's not even anything to worry about.
[20:09.340 --> 20:12.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for listening to this special Mother's Day episode.
[20:12.740 --> 20:15.060]  Once again, big shout out to all the moms for everything they do.
[20:15.060 --> 20:16.060]  Thanks for taking care of us.
[20:16.060 --> 20:18.180]  Thanks for getting us ready for school.
[20:18.180 --> 20:19.660]  Thanks for cleaning up our boo-boos.
[20:19.660 --> 20:20.860]  Thanks for making us hot cocoa.
[20:20.860 --> 20:22.980]  Thanks for all the special stuff that only mom can do.
[20:22.980 --> 20:24.060]  I appreciate it.
[20:24.060 --> 20:26.940]  I'm sure everybody else out there does as well.
[20:26.940 --> 20:29.460]  All right, you guys, I'm wrapping up the podcast.
[20:29.460 --> 20:33.460]  Hey, before you start tweeting me, I know that the numbers got out of order.
[20:33.460 --> 20:37.740]  I recorded the other episode and then I decided, hey, let's put out a Sunday bonus episode.
[20:37.740 --> 20:42.060]  So the numbers will be out of order until number 216 comes out, but I'm sure we will
[20:42.060 --> 20:43.060]  survive.
[20:43.060 --> 20:44.380]  It's just some labels.
[20:44.380 --> 20:47.100]  Don't let Babylon numbers mess with your head, man.
[20:47.100 --> 20:48.100]  We're going to be okay.
[20:48.100 --> 20:50.640]  All right, you guys, make sure you follow me on all the social media.
