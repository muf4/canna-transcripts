[00:00.000 --> 00:02.080]  Hey, welcome back, podcast world!
[00:02.080 --> 00:06.740]  It is time for episode 424 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.740 --> 00:10.480]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:10.480 --> 00:15.160]  If you need new regular, feminized, or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon
[00:15.160 --> 00:18.120]  Elite Seeds, and you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:18.120 --> 00:25.280]  All right, I'm sure most of you know that I like to start this podcast off by talking
[00:25.280 --> 00:26.680]  about what I'm smoking.
[00:26.680 --> 00:31.440]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Tropicana Cookies, full-spectrum extract from our friends
[00:31.440 --> 00:33.000]  at Apothecary Farms.
[00:33.000 --> 00:42.160]  The potency label says this product has 76.3% THC, 0% CBD, and 87.5% total cannabinoids.
[00:42.160 --> 00:45.520]  I'm going to crack this jar open and give it a fresh smell.
[00:45.520 --> 00:47.360]  This concentrate smells amazing.
[00:47.360 --> 00:49.820]  It is funky, it is sweet, it is sour.
[00:49.820 --> 00:51.860]  It is almost like a grapefruit.
[00:51.860 --> 00:56.620]  If you have ever drank a product called a Grapefruit Izzy, in my opinion, this smells
[00:56.620 --> 00:59.980]  just like a fresh, cold Grapefruit Izzy.
[00:59.980 --> 01:02.340]  I can almost smell the carbonation in here.
[01:02.340 --> 01:06.860]  I really enjoy the flavor and aroma on this product, and the high goes straight to my
[01:06.860 --> 01:07.860]  head.
[01:07.860 --> 01:08.860]  It makes me chattery.
[01:08.860 --> 01:10.260]  It gets me creative and talkative.
[01:10.260 --> 01:12.500]  That is perfect podcast concentrate.
[01:12.500 --> 01:17.620]  It leaves a really great sweet and sour, sort of a candy flavor in my mouth, which is really
[01:17.620 --> 01:18.620]  pleasant.
[01:18.620 --> 01:23.300]  Big shout out again to our friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious Tropicana Cookies
[01:23.300 --> 01:26.200]  Full Spectrum Extract.
[01:26.200 --> 01:28.780]  In this episode, I do plan to read a couple of emails.
[01:28.780 --> 01:32.300]  I've got another submission about what 420 means to you.
[01:32.300 --> 01:36.340]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to our friends from Patreon.
[01:36.340 --> 01:38.020]  I want to give a huge shout out to Miss Melville.
[01:38.020 --> 01:40.460]  How about a giant shout out to Richard Memel?
[01:40.460 --> 01:42.180]  A giant shout out to Keith K.
[01:42.180 --> 01:45.420]  A big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Grimble the Druid.
[01:45.420 --> 01:47.700]  As always, a giant shout out to my friend Riley.
[01:47.780 --> 01:50.340]  A big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Paul T.
[01:50.340 --> 01:54.220]  And of course, a shout out to my friend David O.Q.
[01:54.220 --> 01:57.620]  I want to thank each and every one of you for your Patreon support.
[01:57.620 --> 02:02.500]  If you would like to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to patreon.com
[02:02.500 --> 02:04.260]  slash growfromyourheart.
[02:04.260 --> 02:07.260]  All the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:07.260 --> 02:11.580]  And one more time, I want to send a huge thank you to everybody who has contributed to the
[02:11.580 --> 02:12.980]  Patreon campaign.
[02:12.980 --> 02:15.300]  I do appreciate all of that support.
[02:15.300 --> 02:16.460]  And please don't feel bad.
[02:16.460 --> 02:19.180]  Don't feel excluded if you cannot help out on Patreon.
[02:19.180 --> 02:22.340]  I do appreciate the support, but I just appreciate you for listening.
[02:22.340 --> 02:23.860]  I don't expect anything from you.
[02:23.860 --> 02:25.300]  I don't ask anything of you.
[02:25.300 --> 02:28.140]  I just appreciate you for listening and enjoying the show.
[02:28.140 --> 02:29.180]  So big shout out to you all.
[02:29.180 --> 02:30.780]  So thank you for being here.
[02:30.780 --> 02:32.300]  All right, podcast world.
[02:32.300 --> 02:35.980]  I did say that I've got a couple of emails to read for this episode, so let's jump right
[02:35.980 --> 02:37.540]  into that part.
[02:37.540 --> 02:40.340]  If you've got a question that you would like me to read on the show, you can send me an
[02:40.340 --> 02:41.340]  email.
[02:41.340 --> 02:44.340]  My email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[02:44.340 --> 02:45.960]  You know I would love to hear from you.
[02:45.960 --> 02:49.680]  Our first email for this episode goes just like this.
[02:49.680 --> 02:51.880]  Hey, Rastajef.
[02:51.880 --> 02:54.720]  My name is Mike and I'm from Prohibition Land.
[02:54.720 --> 02:57.600]  First off, I want to say thank you for what you do.
[02:57.600 --> 03:02.520]  You know you help people, but honestly, you probably have no clue how much you do help.
[03:02.520 --> 03:03.760]  Hey, that means a lot to me, man.
[03:03.760 --> 03:06.720]  I appreciate hearing that I'm helping somebody.
[03:06.720 --> 03:07.720]  That means a lot to me.
[03:07.720 --> 03:08.800]  That's what the show is for.
[03:08.800 --> 03:11.280]  So just knowing that I'm helping you means a lot.
[03:11.280 --> 03:14.360]  I've honestly never thought about how far my show reaches.
[03:14.360 --> 03:16.240]  I know I get a lot of comments.
[03:16.240 --> 03:17.360]  I know I get a lot of emails.
[03:17.360 --> 03:22.880]  I get a lot of interaction, but I'm really not sure exactly how much help I am providing.
[03:22.880 --> 03:23.880]  So thank you.
[03:23.880 --> 03:27.960]  That means a lot to me just to know that I'm probably reaching further than I had realized
[03:27.960 --> 03:30.520]  is a great compliment and a great little boost.
[03:30.520 --> 03:31.520]  So thank you.
[03:31.520 --> 03:32.520]  I'm going to continue with the email.
[03:32.520 --> 03:36.800]  It goes on to say, when I decided to email you my question, I just planned to email you
[03:36.800 --> 03:41.920]  and ask you the question, but you asked on your show what 420 means to me.
[03:41.960 --> 03:45.880]  I know it's a little bit late and I'm not saying this because of a contest, but when
[03:45.880 --> 03:49.600]  420 means to me is seeing my mom smile.
[03:49.600 --> 03:51.680]  So let me explain.
[03:51.680 --> 03:57.160]  So what this email is referring to right here is a few episodes before 420, I started asking
[03:57.160 --> 04:01.560]  my audience for submissions to tell me what 420 means to you.
[04:01.560 --> 04:06.000]  So this guy is a little bit late for the 420 episode, but I still want to hear his opinion
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.720]  and I still want to share his 420 story with you and what 420 means to him.
[04:10.720 --> 04:12.320]  So let's continue with the message.
[04:12.320 --> 04:13.840]  It goes like this.
[04:13.840 --> 04:17.720]  Again, I am in prohibition land right now in the Bible belt.
[04:17.720 --> 04:22.720]  So growing up, my mom was a school teacher and of course we all grew up with the impression
[04:22.720 --> 04:25.120]  that cannabis was the devil.
[04:25.120 --> 04:29.760]  So as a teenager, when she found out I smoked cannabis, she was pissed, but even worse,
[04:29.760 --> 04:32.200]  she was disappointed in me.
[04:32.200 --> 04:33.840]  Oh, that phrase right there.
[04:33.840 --> 04:37.960]  Have you ever had a parent say, I'm not mad at you, but I'm disappointed in you?
[04:37.960 --> 04:39.280]  That's just, that's the worst.
[04:39.280 --> 04:42.160]  I'd rather somebody be fucking mad at me because I fucked up.
[04:42.160 --> 04:45.280]  When you feel that I'm disappointed in you, I'm not even mad.
[04:45.280 --> 04:46.360]  I'm just disappointed.
[04:46.360 --> 04:48.400]  That makes you feel like shit as a person.
[04:48.400 --> 04:50.040]  That makes you feel about two inches tall.
[04:50.040 --> 04:51.840]  It just makes you feel so weak.
[04:51.840 --> 04:53.640]  You're like, aww.
[04:53.640 --> 04:56.560]  There are only a couple of people you really want to make happy in the world.
[04:56.560 --> 04:59.000]  And when you're younger, it's your mom and your dad.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.280]  And when one of them says, I'm disappointed, aww, that just fucks everything up.
[05:03.280 --> 05:04.800]  So I get you.
[05:04.800 --> 05:07.280]  Even worse, she was disappointed in me.
[05:07.280 --> 05:08.520]  So let's fast forward.
[05:08.560 --> 05:10.160]  I am 36 now.
[05:10.160 --> 05:15.240]  When I was 31, my mom was diagnosed with severe rheumatoid arthritis.
[05:15.240 --> 05:17.360]  And that is painful and miserable.
[05:17.360 --> 05:18.640]  And I'm sorry to hear that.
[05:18.640 --> 05:22.960]  The message says, little did I know what my mother was about to go through.
[05:22.960 --> 05:23.640]  Absolutely.
[05:23.640 --> 05:25.920]  RA is miserable to experience.
[05:25.920 --> 05:29.200]  And it is almost as miserable watching someone you love
[05:29.200 --> 05:31.440]  experience those sort of symptoms.
[05:31.440 --> 05:33.200]  You can almost see the pain in their hands.
[05:33.200 --> 05:35.680]  You can almost see the pain in their joints when they walk.
[05:35.680 --> 05:38.600]  If you know that person, you have seen them go from a healthy person
[05:38.600 --> 05:39.600]  to a person who hurts.
[05:39.600 --> 05:41.120]  And that's just terrible to see.
[05:41.120 --> 05:42.640]  So let's keep going with the message.
[05:42.640 --> 05:45.680]  It says, within four years, my mom had both of her hips
[05:45.680 --> 05:48.720]  and both of her shoulders replaced from her joints flattening.
[05:48.720 --> 05:50.240]  That sounds painful.
[05:50.240 --> 05:53.840]  Then shortly after, she was diagnosed with severe COPD
[05:53.840 --> 05:56.000]  and congestive heart failure.
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.160]  The doctor told my mom that she had two choices.
[05:59.160 --> 06:03.640]  He could prescribe her opioid pain meds, and she would be on them
[06:03.640 --> 06:04.800]  for the rest of her life.
[06:04.800 --> 06:09.120]  And if she went a day without them, basically, God bless her soul.
[06:09.120 --> 06:12.400]  The other option was taking drugs that killed her immune system
[06:12.400 --> 06:13.760]  so she would get sick easily.
[06:13.760 --> 06:16.520]  And the sickness would get really bad because her body
[06:16.520 --> 06:18.840]  can't fight it off naturally.
[06:18.840 --> 06:24.360]  So she picked the opioid meds because it honestly was the safer option.
[06:24.360 --> 06:26.040]  Man, she didn't have much to choose from.
[06:26.040 --> 06:27.480]  She had crap or crap.
[06:27.480 --> 06:30.560]  And it sounds like she picked the less crappy crap.
[06:30.560 --> 06:33.120]  Man, I'm sorry to hear that your mom and your family are in this type
[06:33.120 --> 06:36.120]  of situation as if the RA weren't enough.
[06:36.120 --> 06:37.760]  Then she had to have surgeries.
[06:37.760 --> 06:42.120]  Then she ends up with COPD, which is a chronic obstructive pulmonary
[06:42.120 --> 06:44.480]  disorder, which makes it hard to breathe and you feel like you're
[06:44.480 --> 06:46.360]  drowning constantly.
[06:46.360 --> 06:48.760]  And she's also got congestive heart failure.
[06:48.760 --> 06:51.320]  It sounds like she's having a string of bad luck.
[06:51.320 --> 06:55.600]  Then we've got her on opioid pain medicine, which can't turn out well for her.
[06:55.600 --> 06:56.480]  So let's keep reading.
[06:56.480 --> 07:01.640]  It says, since we are in Indiana, there is no medical cannabis.
[07:01.640 --> 07:05.920]  So she had no other option than to wipe out her immune system or just
[07:05.920 --> 07:08.080]  literally suffer.
[07:08.080 --> 07:12.320]  My mom being my mom, she just quit the pain meds and suffered.
[07:12.320 --> 07:14.760]  Man, that's a strong lady right there.
[07:14.760 --> 07:18.600]  For two years, she couldn't sleep or walk without groaning every step
[07:18.600 --> 07:20.480]  because it hurt so badly.
[07:20.480 --> 07:22.440]  She is on oxygen and she can't smoke.
[07:22.440 --> 07:25.960]  Any good edible is impossible to get around here.
[07:25.960 --> 07:29.760]  You can get butter someone made that I'm not even sure is real.
[07:29.760 --> 07:33.320]  But one day my buddy came back from vacation from Cali and brought
[07:33.320 --> 07:35.520]  edible gummy bears.
[07:35.520 --> 07:39.720]  Me being me, I had to buy some and try them.
[07:39.720 --> 07:43.280]  I ate two of them that night and I woke up the next morning sitting in my
[07:43.280 --> 07:48.280]  recliner with a bowl of melted ice cream spilled all over my lap.
[07:48.280 --> 07:49.960]  All right, so it sounds like the gummy bears worked.
[07:49.960 --> 07:51.000]  You ate two of them.
[07:51.000 --> 07:52.920]  They put you out while you were eating ice cream.
[07:52.920 --> 07:55.560]  You woke up with ice cream all over your lap, dude.
[07:55.560 --> 07:59.440]  Imagine how asleep this guy had to be if cold ice cream, I know it was
[07:59.440 --> 08:03.560]  melted, but it still wasn't warm and it was spilled in his lap on his junk.
[08:03.560 --> 08:06.240]  Imagine how soundly this guy was sleeping.
[08:06.240 --> 08:08.000]  Those gummy bears were working.
[08:08.000 --> 08:09.000]  Let's continue with the email.
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.880]  It says, so I decide I'm going to make my mom try one.
[08:12.880 --> 08:15.040]  All right, so this guy's mom was a teacher.
[08:15.040 --> 08:16.960]  She was anti-cannabis.
[08:16.960 --> 08:19.320]  She was not mad at him.
[08:19.320 --> 08:22.840]  She was disappointed when she discovered that this person was a cannabis
[08:22.840 --> 08:23.960]  consumer.
[08:24.000 --> 08:30.240]  So this guy is going to try to give his mom one of these cannabis infused gummy
[08:30.240 --> 08:31.240]  bears.
[08:31.240 --> 08:32.240]  So let's jump back into the email.
[08:32.240 --> 08:36.240]  It says, I game planned all day how I was going to bring it up to her and had
[08:36.240 --> 08:40.840]  built up the level of balls to actually offer my 60 year old ex-school teacher
[08:40.840 --> 08:44.440]  mom cannabis, which isn't even legal here.
[08:44.440 --> 08:48.360]  So finally I go over there the next evening and I just drop it on her.
[08:48.360 --> 08:51.520]  I told her I have something I think will help her sleep.
[08:51.520 --> 08:56.280]  She asked what, and I told her and what happened next blew my mind.
[08:56.280 --> 08:58.040]  So this guy finally got the balls.
[08:58.040 --> 09:01.160]  He drove over there and he said, mom, I got something I think is going to help
[09:01.160 --> 09:02.160]  you.
[09:02.160 --> 09:06.360]  And what happened next is going to blow our minds because she told me she has
[09:06.360 --> 09:10.520]  wanted to try it and has been reading about it, but didn't figure she would ever
[09:10.520 --> 09:13.960]  be able to get any because of their location.
[09:13.960 --> 09:18.280]  So she snatched the gummy bear out of my hand and couldn't chew it up fast
[09:18.280 --> 09:19.320]  enough.
[09:19.320 --> 09:23.320]  That's pretty cool that your mom was not only open to the idea, but she had been
[09:23.320 --> 09:26.480]  excited and researching the idea herself.
[09:26.480 --> 09:31.240]  That shows you what pain and suffering will do to you when you were in pain long
[09:31.240 --> 09:35.280]  enough and nothing works and you've got enough things making you uncomfortable
[09:35.280 --> 09:38.160]  and you've tried something and it just made you even worse.
[09:38.160 --> 09:39.160]  That will open your mind.
[09:39.160 --> 09:40.400]  You may say, you know what?
[09:40.400 --> 09:43.880]  I think I'm ready to try just about anything.
[09:43.880 --> 09:45.940]  So that opened this lady's mind.
[09:45.940 --> 09:47.760]  She was ready to try some cannabis.
[09:47.760 --> 09:49.920]  She snatched up this gummy bear.
[09:49.920 --> 09:50.920]  She chewed it up.
[09:50.920 --> 09:52.000]  I want to read more into this.
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.240]  It says, I live 30 minutes away from her in a different city, but my brother was
[09:56.240 --> 09:57.560]  taking care of her that night.
[09:57.560 --> 09:59.820]  So I went home the next day.
[09:59.820 --> 10:04.480]  My mom calls me and tells me she got the best sleep she has had since she got
[10:04.480 --> 10:08.440]  our a even better than with any pills.
[10:08.440 --> 10:12.680]  My bro said she was walking to the bathroom without groaning in pain and was
[10:12.680 --> 10:16.420]  even walking faster than regular.
[10:16.420 --> 10:19.980]  So this lady ate one cannabis infused gummy bear.
[10:19.980 --> 10:21.340]  I don't know how many milligrams it was.
[10:21.340 --> 10:22.340]  I don't know the potency.
[10:22.340 --> 10:26.180]  I don't know the THC CBD ratio.
[10:26.180 --> 10:29.500]  It doesn't seem that that matters too much because it worked.
[10:29.500 --> 10:34.300]  It helped improve the quality of this young lady's life.
[10:34.300 --> 10:40.860]  Her rheumatoid arthritis is not debilitating her because cannabis eased up the symptoms
[10:40.860 --> 10:45.060]  enough for her to walk to the bathroom without groaning.
[10:45.060 --> 10:50.140]  Imagine if something you have to do multiple times a day, like simply walk to the bathroom.
[10:50.140 --> 10:51.140]  Everybody has to do that.
[10:51.140 --> 10:52.380]  You got to get there somehow.
[10:52.380 --> 10:53.700]  You got to either roll over there.
[10:53.700 --> 10:54.700]  You got to crawl over there.
[10:54.700 --> 10:55.860]  You got to walk over there.
[10:55.860 --> 10:56.860]  You could do cartwheels.
[10:56.860 --> 10:57.860]  You got to get there.
[10:57.860 --> 10:59.980]  If you're going to take a piss, you got to get there or you get to wallow around in your
[10:59.980 --> 11:01.520]  own piss all day.
[11:01.520 --> 11:04.780]  Imagine if that was painful, just getting up right now to go piss.
[11:04.780 --> 11:05.780]  It hurts.
[11:05.780 --> 11:06.780]  My back hurts.
[11:06.780 --> 11:07.780]  My hips hurt.
[11:07.780 --> 11:08.780]  My knees hurt.
[11:08.780 --> 11:09.780]  It takes effort.
[11:09.780 --> 11:10.780]  I have to grunt and groan.
[11:10.780 --> 11:11.780]  Sound like this.
[11:11.780 --> 11:12.780]  Oh, oh, shit.
[11:12.780 --> 11:15.040]  Oh, just trying to get up.
[11:15.040 --> 11:18.720]  Imagine if your pain felt like that and you found something that you could eat and it
[11:18.720 --> 11:21.720]  would take your pain away enough to where you don't groan.
[11:21.720 --> 11:22.720]  You're still going to hurt.
[11:22.720 --> 11:25.480]  You're still going to have some aches and pains, some discomfort, but if you could just
[11:25.480 --> 11:30.360]  take that one level of, oh, just tone that down, take that off of it, you are improving
[11:30.360 --> 11:31.640]  the quality of your life.
[11:31.640 --> 11:36.400]  For that not to be allowed because of some invisible line that separates states from
[11:36.400 --> 11:41.080]  states and legality from legality, that is fucking stupid.
[11:41.080 --> 11:44.920]  This lady feels better because she ate something that came off of a plant that grows out of
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.280]  the ground and the law is trying to stop that from happening.
[11:48.280 --> 11:50.640]  All right, I'm getting way off track.
[11:50.640 --> 11:51.720]  Let's get back on track here.
[11:51.720 --> 11:52.720]  There is more to this message.
[11:52.720 --> 11:56.760]  It says, the problem is I can't barely get edibles here.
[11:56.760 --> 12:01.320]  I have gotten edibles three more times since that people have brought from legal states
[12:01.320 --> 12:06.440]  and every time I get and give them to my mom, she gets the biggest smile on her face because
[12:06.440 --> 12:09.880]  she knows she's going to get some relief and some sleep.
[12:10.040 --> 12:16.280]  Again, that invisible line that prevents people from getting relief and sleep is fucking ridiculous
[12:16.280 --> 12:17.720]  in my mind.
[12:17.720 --> 12:21.760]  There's more to this email and it says, even though it is just a few hours of a break,
[12:21.760 --> 12:23.160]  it means everything to her.
[12:23.160 --> 12:24.280]  Oh yeah, I'm sure.
[12:24.280 --> 12:27.520]  That's like setting down weights that you've been carrying all day.
[12:27.520 --> 12:28.520]  Pain is terrible.
[12:28.520 --> 12:29.920]  Pain will put you in a bad mood.
[12:29.920 --> 12:31.440]  Pain will make you depressed.
[12:31.440 --> 12:34.440]  Pain will make you not able to enjoy your life.
[12:34.440 --> 12:37.940]  That few hours of relief is everything to her.
[12:37.940 --> 12:40.540]  That is the best few hours of her month probably.
[12:40.540 --> 12:45.540]  When she gets to eat that edible, 30, 45 minutes after it kicks in, that is the best time of
[12:45.540 --> 12:46.540]  her month.
[12:46.540 --> 12:50.180]  I could imagine that she gets a big smile on her face, even though it is just a few
[12:50.180 --> 12:51.180]  hours.
[12:51.180 --> 12:54.500]  He says, we will be lucky to have her with us for another year.
[12:54.500 --> 12:59.600]  I can't think of anything better that I could give her at this point in her life.
[12:59.600 --> 13:02.460]  That is a bold finishing sentence right there.
[13:02.460 --> 13:04.780]  You'll be lucky to have her with you for another year.
[13:05.100 --> 13:11.220]  Man, I'm glad you have found something to keep her comfortable for this year.
[13:11.220 --> 13:13.820]  I am saddened to hear that you've only got her for another year.
[13:13.820 --> 13:15.460]  Please enjoy that year with her.
[13:15.460 --> 13:19.020]  I can't encourage you to acquire edibles in your illegal state.
[13:19.020 --> 13:24.620]  I can't do anything to help you out, but man, I hope that somehow you are able to keep mom
[13:24.620 --> 13:25.820]  heavily medicated.
[13:25.820 --> 13:28.340]  I hope you're able to spend a lot of time with her.
[13:28.340 --> 13:32.500]  Just enjoy her while she's here and keep her as comfortable as you possibly can.
[13:32.500 --> 13:38.100]  He wraps up this portion of the message and it says, so that is what 420 means to me.
[13:38.100 --> 13:42.740]  Dude, that is a serious, heavy, deep 420 message.
[13:42.740 --> 13:43.900]  I appreciate that.
[13:43.900 --> 13:45.680]  Thank you for sharing so much with me.
[13:45.680 --> 13:51.740]  We got a lot of really serious, really deep, what does 420 mean to you submissions, and
[13:51.740 --> 13:52.780]  I appreciate that.
[13:52.780 --> 13:57.900]  Thank you to everybody for opening up so much to me, to the audience, for the show, for
[13:57.900 --> 13:59.300]  the sake of cannabis.
[13:59.300 --> 14:00.300]  Thank you.
[14:00.620 --> 14:02.500]  Now there is a second half to this email.
[14:02.500 --> 14:08.460]  This is the question portion and it goes a lot like this, but here is my question.
[14:08.460 --> 14:14.140]  Since the cannabis here is all shitty, swag, Mexican, brick, bullshit, I've decided I'm
[14:14.140 --> 14:19.380]  going to grow or hopefully grow some quality cannabis to make edibles for my mom.
[14:19.380 --> 14:23.620]  Like I said earlier, I can't encourage, condone, or promote you doing anything illegal, but
[14:23.620 --> 14:27.900]  you're an adult, so you are responsible for yourself and I am proud of you for taking
[14:27.900 --> 14:29.780]  action to take care of your mom.
[14:29.780 --> 14:33.780]  I will continue with the message and it says, I know hydro isn't the smartest way for a
[14:33.780 --> 14:36.660]  noob, but from what I understand, it is quicker.
[14:36.660 --> 14:41.380]  I'm also going to grow three plants in soil in case I fuck up the hydro, but I have studied
[14:41.380 --> 14:43.340]  a lot more on soil growing.
[14:43.340 --> 14:46.820]  All right, so let's talk about one statement here in that first paragraph.
[14:46.820 --> 14:51.140]  He says, I know hydro isn't the smartest for a noob, but from what I understand, it is
[14:51.140 --> 14:52.400]  quicker.
[14:52.400 --> 14:54.160]  Your plants will grow more quickly.
[14:54.160 --> 14:58.340]  You may be able to cut off seven to 10 days of your veg time, depending on how big you
[14:58.340 --> 15:02.980]  want your plants, but it's not going to go so much more quickly that it's going to save
[15:02.980 --> 15:06.980]  you a lot of time, especially in a small home grow.
[15:06.980 --> 15:09.420]  You're probably going to be running small plants.
[15:09.420 --> 15:13.900]  One or two weeks at the very most is all you're going to save in a hydro setup and it's going
[15:13.900 --> 15:16.900]  to take you a couple of runs to get that dialed in.
[15:16.900 --> 15:19.100]  So yes, they may grow more quickly.
[15:19.100 --> 15:24.660]  You may see more productivity in a hydro system, but it is going to take more detail.
[15:24.660 --> 15:25.900]  It is going to take more work.
[15:25.900 --> 15:28.300]  You have to pay much more attention.
[15:28.300 --> 15:33.700]  You'll also notice that the plants in soil are much more forgiving than the plants in
[15:33.700 --> 15:34.780]  your hydro system.
[15:34.780 --> 15:37.860]  If you mess up with your soil crop, you can rescue it.
[15:37.860 --> 15:42.140]  If you make a small mistake in your hydroponic setup, you will notice it and it may be hard
[15:42.140 --> 15:43.140]  to recover.
[15:43.140 --> 15:45.300]  So soil is much more forgiving.
[15:45.300 --> 15:51.080]  Now talking about being faster, it is going to take the same amount of time to flower.
[15:51.080 --> 15:55.180]  If you were in soil, soilless mix, hydro, whatever you're growing in, whatever your
[15:55.180 --> 15:59.820]  setup is, if your plant takes nine weeks to flower, it's going to take nine weeks to
[15:59.820 --> 16:00.820]  flower.
[16:00.820 --> 16:03.180]  You can't make it go faster because of your medium.
[16:03.180 --> 16:06.940]  So yes, in theory, your hydroponic plant will grow a little more quickly.
[16:06.940 --> 16:07.940]  It'll have more vigor.
[16:07.940 --> 16:11.180]  It may get larger, but it also is more work.
[16:11.180 --> 16:16.460]  It takes a lot more attention to detail and if you mess up, it is much harder to correct
[16:16.460 --> 16:18.060]  your mistake.
[16:18.060 --> 16:19.680]  It sounds like you've got a great idea.
[16:19.680 --> 16:21.980]  You're going to run a few plants in hydro.
[16:21.980 --> 16:24.380]  You're going to run a few plants in soil.
[16:24.580 --> 16:28.540]  I'm really hoping that you're going to run the same cultivar in each setup so that you
[16:28.540 --> 16:33.560]  can pay attention to what's going on and not be confused by different plants reacting differently.
[16:33.560 --> 16:37.860]  What I mean by that is in your hydroponic setup and your soil setup, I hope you've got
[16:37.860 --> 16:44.500]  golden goat in hydro and golden goat in soil and not golden goat in soil and fucking blue
[16:44.500 --> 16:48.500]  dream in hydro because those are two different plants.
[16:48.500 --> 16:50.300]  They're going to grow two different ways.
[16:50.300 --> 16:54.060]  It is much easier to have one plant and learn that one plant.
[16:54.740 --> 16:56.340]  I've talked about that in previous episodes.
[16:56.340 --> 16:57.940]  This is just my suggestion.
[16:57.940 --> 17:04.000]  Again, you're a grown ass man or a grown ass woman or a grown ass non-binary gendered adult.
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.220]  Do whatever you want to do, hashtag America.
[17:07.220 --> 17:08.900]  But I would suggest one cultivar.
[17:08.900 --> 17:13.660]  I would try to run the same thing, especially as a new grower running multiple setups.
[17:13.660 --> 17:14.700]  You can learn a lot this way.
[17:14.700 --> 17:18.380]  You've got an opportunity to learn a lot about one specific cultivar.
[17:18.380 --> 17:23.460]  If you can get six clones or eight clones of one thing and plant them in your hydro
[17:23.460 --> 17:27.300]  and in your soil, and then you have some room for experiments with each one within
[17:27.300 --> 17:29.740]  each setup, you can learn a lot of things.
[17:29.740 --> 17:34.220]  That is basically like having two grows that you can experiment on at the same time.
[17:34.220 --> 17:37.220]  But I, again, highly suggest one cultivar.
[17:37.220 --> 17:40.580]  I do know that you're in prohibition land, so you're going to have to get whatever you
[17:40.580 --> 17:41.580]  get.
[17:41.580 --> 17:42.980]  You may not have access to clones.
[17:42.980 --> 17:46.220]  I don't know how you feel about ordering seeds online.
[17:46.220 --> 17:49.060]  It doesn't sound like you're going to do a pheno hunt.
[17:49.060 --> 17:50.860]  It sounds like you're ready just to get started.
[17:50.940 --> 17:55.140]  Once you get clones or seeds, I assume you're going to just pop some in these pots and get
[17:55.140 --> 17:56.140]  started.
[17:56.140 --> 17:57.740]  I would suggest doing a quick pheno hunt.
[17:57.740 --> 17:59.940]  I've done episodes on pheno hunting before.
[17:59.940 --> 18:04.660]  I would do a quick pheno hunt, find a keeper, and then clone that cultivar and run it throughout
[18:04.660 --> 18:05.980]  all of your systems.
[18:05.980 --> 18:10.340]  Learn that cultivar, learn your systems, and get that dialed in.
[18:10.340 --> 18:14.420]  If you're interested in listening to the pheno hunt episode, I did an entire talk about pheno
[18:14.420 --> 18:17.180]  hunting on episode 376.
[18:17.180 --> 18:21.660]  I suggest starting with a pheno hunt, narrow it down to one keeper, then work that one
[18:21.660 --> 18:23.300]  keeper in all systems.
[18:23.300 --> 18:25.500]  That is my idea for what I would do if I were you.
[18:25.500 --> 18:29.340]  All right, there is more to this email, so I need to get my rambly ass back on track.
[18:29.340 --> 18:32.860]  Big shout out again to the Tropicana Cookies full spectrum extract.
[18:32.860 --> 18:35.580]  It really got me talkative for this episode.
[18:35.580 --> 18:36.580]  There is more.
[18:36.580 --> 18:41.780]  It says, my question is this, and it relates to both soil and hydro.
[18:41.780 --> 18:47.260]  I always hear you talk about reverse osmosis or filtered water being the best to use.
[18:47.260 --> 18:49.620]  How about pH rainwater?
[18:49.620 --> 18:53.940]  Would that be good to use to put your newts in and water your soil plants or to run in
[18:53.940 --> 18:56.020]  your deep water culture reservoir?
[18:56.020 --> 19:00.420]  I'm just wondering because I went to Walmart and I have a 20 gallon res.
[19:00.420 --> 19:04.620]  RO water was $6.50 for five gallons.
[19:04.620 --> 19:09.540]  So if I go that route, I'll be spending $32 a week just on water.
[19:09.540 --> 19:13.380]  If rainwater isn't good, is there a cheaper option?
[19:13.380 --> 19:15.100]  Rainwater is acceptable.
[19:15.100 --> 19:17.420]  Rainwater will contain trace minerals.
[19:17.420 --> 19:18.580]  Just be careful.
[19:18.580 --> 19:20.820]  In most regions, rainwater should be safe.
[19:20.820 --> 19:25.140]  If you live in a really densely, if you live in China, you may reconsider that.
[19:25.140 --> 19:28.580]  If you've got a lot of pollution, a lot of fog, you may reconsider.
[19:28.580 --> 19:30.980]  Most areas, you should be okay.
[19:30.980 --> 19:35.460]  One thing to think about when you are collecting rainwater, how are you gathering it?
[19:35.460 --> 19:39.020]  Is that water running off of something before it gets to your collection vessel?
[19:39.020 --> 19:43.140]  Is it coming off of the tin roof, which may have rust on it, which may have other stuff
[19:43.140 --> 19:44.140]  on it?
[19:44.140 --> 19:48.260]  Just think about where that water is running before it ends up in your collection vessel
[19:48.260 --> 19:49.940]  and it should be safe to feed to your plants.
[19:49.940 --> 19:53.220]  Of course, add your nutrients, then adjust the pH.
[19:53.220 --> 19:57.140]  You're going to want to put nutrients in it, then adjust the pH before feeding it to the
[19:57.140 --> 19:58.140]  plants.
[19:58.140 --> 20:00.700]  Don't adjust the pH, then put newts in it because you're going to have to adjust the
[20:00.700 --> 20:02.180]  pH once again.
[20:02.180 --> 20:07.500]  So nutrients, pH, check your EC and your PPMs and then feed it to the plants if you were
[20:07.500 --> 20:09.780]  in the acceptable ranges.
[20:09.780 --> 20:10.780]  There is a follow-up question.
[20:10.780 --> 20:15.420]  It says, also, what is the best temperature to keep my water in my res?
[20:15.420 --> 20:18.940]  I'm reading everything from 55 to 72 degrees.
[20:18.940 --> 20:20.400]  Thanks again for what you do.
[20:20.400 --> 20:24.000]  You can use my name and location on the show if you wish.
[20:24.000 --> 20:28.500]  Maybe someone important will hear it and change these BS laws here so my mother can get the
[20:28.500 --> 20:32.780]  relief she so desperately needs and deserves.
[20:32.780 --> 20:33.780]  Best wishes, bro.
[20:33.780 --> 20:35.100]  And then he sends a fist bump.
[20:35.100 --> 20:36.980]  Hey, thanks for the great message, man.
[20:36.980 --> 20:42.860]  I hope that somebody realizes that cannabis is helping your mother improve the quality
[20:42.860 --> 20:46.780]  of her life and they will help change those BS laws that we talk about.
[20:46.780 --> 20:47.940]  So let's address this question.
[20:47.940 --> 20:52.980]  He said, what is the best temperature to keep the water in my reservoir?
[20:52.980 --> 20:59.360]  I'm going to say somewhere between 62 and 68 degrees is the best range to keep the temperature
[20:59.360 --> 21:01.300]  of the water in your reservoir.
[21:01.300 --> 21:03.740]  Any colder than that, the plants will start slowing down.
[21:03.740 --> 21:05.100]  They won't take up any nutrients.
[21:05.100 --> 21:06.860]  The metabolism will start slowing down.
[21:06.860 --> 21:10.420]  The plants will actually think that it is becoming winter time.
[21:10.420 --> 21:13.540]  If you are not flowering the plants, they may try to flower.
[21:13.540 --> 21:17.740]  They may try to start finishing and ripening up because that's what they think it is time
[21:17.740 --> 21:18.740]  for.
[21:18.740 --> 21:21.340]  They think, oh, it's cold, winter's coming, it is time to finish up.
[21:21.340 --> 21:26.700]  So somewhere between 62 and 68 degrees would be your ideal temperature to keep your plants
[21:26.700 --> 21:29.580]  in their most vigorous state of growth.
[21:29.580 --> 21:30.580]  All right.
[21:30.580 --> 21:31.900]  That was a long, great email.
[21:31.900 --> 21:34.100]  I want to thank you for the great message.
[21:34.100 --> 21:36.900]  Big shout out to my new friend, Mike, out there in Hoosier country.
[21:36.900 --> 21:39.980]  Hey Mike, I hope you and your mom are both doing wonderfully.
[21:39.980 --> 21:41.540]  All right, podcast world.
[21:41.540 --> 21:44.660]  I know I said at the start of the show, I had two emails to read.
[21:44.660 --> 21:46.380]  That one email got away from me.
[21:46.380 --> 21:50.680]  I got a little rambly, a little long-winded because of these Tropicana cookies dabs.
[21:50.680 --> 21:54.780]  So that means there is only one email on this episode, which means I have got a lot of great
[21:54.780 --> 21:56.660]  content for future episodes.
[21:56.660 --> 21:58.300]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[21:58.300 --> 22:02.220]  I'll be back Monday with a long, full length podcast.
