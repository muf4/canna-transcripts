[00:05.520 --> 00:08.440]  episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[00:43.800 --> 01:01.630]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.

[01:05.750 --> 01:06.750]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:06.750 --> 01:07.750]  That's right.
[01:07.750 --> 01:12.070]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[01:12.070 --> 01:15.190]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[01:15.190 --> 01:18.750]  current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:18.750 --> 01:20.230]  I'm your host, Roston Jeff.
[01:20.230 --> 01:22.310]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:22.310 --> 01:25.110]  As always, you guys, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots band
[01:25.110 --> 01:26.430]  for letting me use their music on the show.
[01:26.430 --> 01:30.950]  Right now, you're listening to the Doggy Dub off the album, The Constant Struggle.
[01:30.950 --> 01:34.150]  Big shout out to Cat Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:34.150 --> 01:37.190]  I'm going to turn down that music.
[01:37.190 --> 01:40.270]  Before we get too far, this podcast is brought to you by my friends at Hygro Indoor Growing

[02:24.710 --> 02:29.670]  All right, I'm going to turn down that music.
[02:29.670 --> 02:30.670]  There we go.
[02:30.670 --> 02:31.670]  There we go.
[02:31.670 --> 02:32.670]  It's a little better.
[02:32.670 --> 02:33.670]  How are you guys doing today?
[02:33.670 --> 02:34.670]  I got a bunch of news articles for you.
[02:35.190 --> 02:39.470]  Before we get to the news articles, I want to talk about something that I watched this
[02:39.470 --> 02:40.670]  weekend.
[02:40.670 --> 02:45.710]  I didn't get to go, but I definitely jumped on the internet and saw some replays.
[02:45.710 --> 02:49.950]  The Grateful Dead did some shows in Santa Clara this weekend.
[02:49.950 --> 02:52.730]  Anybody that knows me knows that I'm a huge Grateful Dead fan.
[02:52.730 --> 02:58.990]  The Grateful Dead has a lot to do with who I am and why I am who I am and what I am.
[02:58.990 --> 03:00.150]  I've been a Grateful Dead fan.
[03:00.150 --> 03:01.430]  I've been a Jerry Garcia fan.
[03:01.430 --> 03:05.030]  I've been a Jamrock fan since the early 90s, probably 93.
[03:05.030 --> 03:10.870]  No, I'm going to say 95 because I moved here late 94, early 94, whatever.
[03:10.870 --> 03:14.350]  Anyway, my first fish show was 6995.
[03:14.350 --> 03:19.430]  I've been listening to the Dead, Fish, all of that stuff heavily, heavily since 95.
[03:19.430 --> 03:21.030]  I did a whole bunch of fish shows.
[03:21.030 --> 03:25.710]  Me and my best friend, Rob the Dude, did a whole bunch of widespread panic shows one
[03:25.710 --> 03:28.310]  summer, Summer Tour 2001.
[03:28.310 --> 03:29.310]  We did about 20 shows.
[03:29.310 --> 03:30.310]  That was pretty epic.
[03:31.030 --> 03:34.630]  So, the Grateful Dead is a huge part of why I am who I am.
[03:34.630 --> 03:41.110]  I learned a lot of things on Fish Tour a lot and further festival parking lots and what
[03:41.110 --> 03:42.110]  have you.
[03:42.110 --> 03:43.350]  So, I watched these.
[03:43.350 --> 03:45.190]  So, the Grateful Dead got back together.
[03:45.190 --> 03:47.270]  And of course, Jerry Garcia is no longer with us.
[03:47.270 --> 03:49.350]  He's been gone for several years now.
[03:49.350 --> 03:55.530]  So, filling in Jerry's shoes was Trey from Fish, which you would think that's like most
[03:55.530 --> 04:01.130]  of Fish and Grateful Dead fans biggest wet dream, but it almost, it was so overhyped
[04:01.130 --> 04:02.850]  and so big that it just seemed weird to me.
[04:02.850 --> 04:04.330]  It seemed like a big commercial thing.
[04:04.330 --> 04:05.330]  It seemed right.
[04:05.330 --> 04:10.610]  Trey was the dude to choose, but it was almost, it put up so much hype and so much expectation
[04:10.610 --> 04:12.650]  and so much pressure that it was just weird.
[04:12.650 --> 04:15.730]  So, watching the, I didn't go to the shows.
[04:15.730 --> 04:18.370]  I should have gone, but that was, it's hella expensive.
[04:18.370 --> 04:19.370]  I got a lot of responsibilities.
[04:19.370 --> 04:24.210]  I didn't feel like it'd be right to go take a week off to go to some shows right now.
[04:24.210 --> 04:26.850]  But I did watch them online.
[04:26.850 --> 04:29.450]  It's the first two shows that they've done.
[04:29.450 --> 04:30.690]  These guys have never done a show together.
[04:30.690 --> 04:33.330]  So, it's the first two shows they've done in public, and they've got three more shows
[04:33.330 --> 04:36.650]  coming up over the 4th of July weekend.
[04:36.650 --> 04:41.650]  I was totally satisfied with what I saw, but it seemed really weird watching it.
[04:41.650 --> 04:45.930]  It was like watching a Grateful Dead cover band do Grateful Dead songs.
[04:45.930 --> 04:47.890]  They didn't feel natural.
[04:47.890 --> 04:49.090]  They didn't flow.
[04:49.090 --> 04:51.210]  Something wasn't meshing.
[04:51.210 --> 04:55.170]  There was not a leader to that band is something that I think I noticed.
[04:55.170 --> 04:58.570]  That band doesn't have a solid leader.
[04:58.570 --> 05:02.110]  Bobby's trying to lead the band, but it doesn't seem like he's able to get control because
[05:02.110 --> 05:04.850]  no one wants to listen to him.
[05:04.850 --> 05:06.610]  Trey seems timid.
[05:06.610 --> 05:10.290]  He doesn't want to let loose and solo like he should.
[05:10.290 --> 05:12.730]  But by the end of the second show, it felt like everything was right, but that was the
[05:12.730 --> 05:15.970]  end of the second show, and that was the end of the weekend and everything was wrapping
[05:15.970 --> 05:16.970]  up.
[05:17.210 --> 05:21.530]  I'm hoping that by the time they get to the Chicago venue, by the time this show comes
[05:21.530 --> 05:25.330]  out, they will be in Chicago and they will be setting up.
[05:25.330 --> 05:26.410]  They may have already even played.
[05:26.410 --> 05:28.170]  I'm not sure if this will come out on Thursday or Monday.
[05:28.170 --> 05:33.650]  We'll see how things go, but I hope I can get it out for you by Thursday.
[05:33.650 --> 05:35.490]  The Grateful Dead, they've got some improvement to do.
[05:35.490 --> 05:39.230]  Hopefully, they talk about what didn't work while they're on the road, and then they figured
[05:39.230 --> 05:40.370]  out by the weekend.
[05:40.370 --> 05:43.690]  I'm thinking that they saved up the better songs that they practiced for.
[05:43.690 --> 05:46.410]  I'm not saying the setlist over this weekend wasn't amazing.
[05:46.410 --> 05:51.010]  All of the songs were great, but I'm hoping that they saved up some of the more.
[05:51.010 --> 05:57.330]  Trey didn't sing but for one song this whole weekend, so I'm hoping they got more Trey
[05:57.330 --> 05:59.650]  songs lined up for the Chicago shows.
[05:59.650 --> 06:04.010]  I'm hoping that we get to hear Terrapin Station with Trey on vocals.
[06:04.010 --> 06:06.930]  There are several that I would like to hear Trey sing.
[06:06.930 --> 06:10.770]  So I'm probably boring the hell out of a lot of my fans with my Grateful Dead talk, a lot
[06:10.770 --> 06:13.650]  of the people listening, but the Grateful Dead's a big part of who I am, so I really
[06:13.650 --> 06:15.570]  wanted to talk about that.
[06:15.730 --> 06:19.730]  I'm really grateful that they're going to Chicago over the 4th of July weekend.
[06:19.730 --> 06:20.730]  Check that shit out.
[06:20.730 --> 06:21.730]  That'll be really neat.
[06:21.730 --> 06:28.970]  So my next topic, I have a friend named, his name is Tim, and he actually has a company
[06:28.970 --> 06:33.730]  that sells a product called a Torchless Nail, and it's a Torchless Dab Nail.
[06:33.730 --> 06:37.090]  I've been very curious about this product.
[06:37.090 --> 06:38.210]  Tim was passing through.
[06:38.210 --> 06:39.370]  Tim does not live in Colorado.
[06:39.370 --> 06:43.890]  He lives in another state, but he was passing through my town, and he was kind enough.
[06:44.210 --> 06:47.690]  Tim, if you're passing through, dude, you're always invited here to come take some dabs
[06:47.690 --> 06:51.610]  at my house, even if you don't have cool toys with you, even if you don't have top shelf
[06:51.610 --> 06:54.330]  extracts with you, you're always welcome.
[06:54.330 --> 06:57.870]  I did not purchase one at this time, but I will in the future.
[06:57.870 --> 07:01.490]  It's not something that's in my budget or my need right now, but when I'm ready for
[07:01.490 --> 07:03.210]  it, I'm going to grab one of these things.
[07:03.210 --> 07:05.730]  It's called the Torchless Nail.
[07:05.730 --> 07:14.690]  It is a dab nail that attaches to any rig that is basically battery operated.
[07:14.690 --> 07:15.690]  It's got a battery pack.
[07:15.690 --> 07:18.870]  The battery pack is kind of big and kind of cumbersome, to be honest with you.
[07:18.870 --> 07:23.090]  It's the size of a remote control, but it is heavier than a remote control.
[07:23.090 --> 07:27.890]  If you used to drive RC cars, it's like an old RC car battery is what it reminds me of.
[07:27.890 --> 07:31.290]  You plug in, this thing has a plug in that comes undone, so you don't always have to
[07:31.290 --> 07:34.170]  have a cord hanging from it, but you plug it in, it charges.
[07:34.170 --> 07:38.450]  Then the coil attaches to it, and then the coil attaches to a bowl piece, which fits
[07:38.450 --> 07:42.650]  onto your bong or your rig or whatever you want to call it, whatever you're using.
[07:42.650 --> 07:45.270]  It attaches to your glass piece.
[07:45.270 --> 07:47.310]  Then the battery pack has a button.
[07:47.310 --> 07:54.690]  When you hold the button, it heats up an element inside of the bowl piece that makes your hash,
[07:54.690 --> 07:56.130]  your shatter.
[07:56.130 --> 07:58.490]  What we tried on it was shatter and butter and wax.
[07:58.490 --> 07:59.890]  I did not try solventless.
[07:59.890 --> 08:03.890]  I did not try the ... I didn't try anything else.
[08:03.890 --> 08:10.210]  I only know how this works for shatter, wax, and some buttery type hash.
[08:10.210 --> 08:13.590]  We put plenty ... You can stuff this thing with plenty of hash too.
[08:13.590 --> 08:16.250]  We put a lot of hash on there, probably a half a gram.
[08:16.250 --> 08:18.250]  Then you push the button and hold the button.
[08:18.250 --> 08:20.610]  As soon as you push it, the hash starts melting.
[08:20.610 --> 08:23.250]  It takes like ... It's a very little delay.
[08:23.250 --> 08:28.050]  You start toking, and once you start getting smoke into your lungs, once you start feeling
[08:28.050 --> 08:32.170]  it, then I started feathering the button, just like let it go, hold it, let it go, hold
[08:32.170 --> 08:33.170]  it, let it go, hold it.
[08:33.450 --> 08:36.570]  I like to take a big, chunky dab, but what I noticed is as soon as you let go of the
[08:36.570 --> 08:40.650]  button, it stops cooking as soon as you let go.
[08:40.650 --> 08:42.090]  You can really control your dabs.
[08:42.090 --> 08:43.090]  It is kind of nice.
[08:43.090 --> 08:48.330]  Now, the part that I was concerned with, and it did pass my inspection.
[08:48.330 --> 08:49.850]  Let me say that before I go too far.
[08:49.850 --> 08:57.850]  The part that I was concerned with is we've got a wire that goes to a bowl, and that bowl
[08:57.850 --> 09:01.170]  is heating something inside of the bowl where I'm keeping my extracts.
[09:01.170 --> 09:07.530]  I was worried about heating polyurethane wiring or whatever was inside of that bowl.
[09:07.530 --> 09:13.690]  My friend Tim gave me the liberty to take this piece apart and inspect it completely.
[09:13.690 --> 09:16.210]  Inside of there, it's a glass bowl.
[09:16.210 --> 09:19.290]  It looks kind of like your normal bong bowl, or if you've got a health stone pipe, it's
[09:19.290 --> 09:21.730]  very similar to that.
[09:21.730 --> 09:27.570]  It's a glass bowl with basically a titanium screen inside of it.
[09:27.570 --> 09:33.010]  Wrapped around that titanium screen is, and we weren't sure if it was copper or brass,
[09:33.010 --> 09:37.330]  but wrapped around that titanium screen is a copper or brass coil.
[09:37.330 --> 09:42.370]  It almost looks like an alligator clip or a battery clip for your car, like where your
[09:42.370 --> 09:43.450]  car battery goes in.
[09:43.450 --> 09:48.970]  It almost looks like that, wrapped around a titanium disc placed inside of a glass bowl.
[09:48.970 --> 09:56.170]  As soon as you press the button, that copper or brass element essentially heats up around
[09:56.170 --> 09:59.850]  that titanium disc because of the electricity flowing through it.
[09:59.850 --> 10:02.930]  It heats up and that's what melts your dabs.
[10:02.930 --> 10:06.490]  As soon as you let go of it, you can touch the glass and it's not hot.
[10:06.490 --> 10:11.450]  You can hold the glass while you take your dabs and it won't burn you.
[10:11.450 --> 10:16.570]  If you were to maybe think about dabbing in the car on the road and you didn't want to
[10:16.570 --> 10:21.210]  use the torch, this device would be perfect.
[10:21.210 --> 10:26.090]  You just push a little button and you inhale and you get pretty healthy, pretty chunky
[10:26.090 --> 10:27.090]  rips.
[10:27.090 --> 10:30.770]  I have to say the Torchless Nail is Rasta Jeff approved.
[10:30.770 --> 10:33.410]  I'm going to give it at least a solid four stars.
[10:33.410 --> 10:36.370]  If I could play with it again, I would give it five full stars.
[10:36.370 --> 10:39.650]  I've never done a real full rating test or anything.
[10:39.650 --> 10:40.650]  You know what I mean?
[10:40.650 --> 10:43.570]  We don't have a rating scale, but on a scale of one to five, I'm going to give it a solid
[10:43.570 --> 10:44.570]  four.
[10:44.570 --> 10:49.010]  Then if I get to play with it a couple more times and learn the button feathering, the
[10:49.010 --> 10:54.050]  technique, how much to push and let go, that sucker just might get five stars.
[10:54.050 --> 10:55.050]  I want to compare it.
[10:55.050 --> 10:58.770]  I want to take my normal rig with me for a day and take the Torchless Nail with me for
[10:58.770 --> 11:02.250]  a day and see which one I end up hitting on the second day.
[11:02.250 --> 11:04.190]  Day one, maybe I'll get tired of torching.
[11:04.190 --> 11:08.650]  Maybe day two or day one, I'll get tired of pushing the button and just see which one
[11:08.650 --> 11:09.650]  I like better.
[11:09.650 --> 11:11.570]  But that's enough ranting about the Torchless Nail.
[11:11.570 --> 11:14.330]  If you're interested in the Torchless Nail, let me know.
[11:14.330 --> 11:17.090]  I will put you in touch with my friend who distributes them.
[11:17.410 --> 11:21.170]  We'll try to get you the best deal possible since I just advertised them very well on
[11:21.170 --> 11:22.370]  the podcast for him.
[11:22.370 --> 11:23.370]  Let me say this.
[11:23.370 --> 11:25.290]  He did not pay me to say any of this.
[11:25.290 --> 11:29.330]  He brought the nail to be kind to let me check it out because I told him I was curious about
[11:29.330 --> 11:30.330]  the inside.
[11:30.330 --> 11:32.890]  So big shout out to Tim if you're listening.
[11:32.890 --> 11:33.890]  Thanks for bringing that.
[11:33.890 --> 11:34.890]  Big shout out to Zach.
[11:34.890 --> 11:36.050]  Happy late birthday, bro.
[11:36.050 --> 11:38.810]  But I hope everything's going well for you.
[11:38.810 --> 11:41.890]  So let's get into some news articles, you guys.
[11:41.890 --> 11:46.730]  On two podcasts ago, our buddy Mike was here and we talked about a raid.
[11:46.730 --> 11:53.970]  A raid where the police officers used a battering ram to bash in the door of a dispensary that
[11:53.970 --> 11:56.890]  the dispensary was open and the door was unlocked.
[11:56.890 --> 12:01.930]  Then they proceeded to treat all of the customers like criminals when nobody was committing
[12:01.930 --> 12:02.930]  a crime.
[12:02.930 --> 12:06.730]  They were actually there to serve a cease and desist order is what they should have
[12:06.730 --> 12:07.730]  done.
[12:07.730 --> 12:11.450]  But instead they went in, they treated everybody like criminals.
[12:11.450 --> 12:13.210]  They destroyed most of the dispensary.
[12:13.210 --> 12:14.210]  Oh, excuse me.
[12:14.210 --> 12:15.210]  I'm burping.
[12:15.490 --> 12:19.210]  Ah, these cops were complete assholes.
[12:19.210 --> 12:23.930]  What I thought they did was completely disrespectful and apparently some other people did too because
[12:23.930 --> 12:26.010]  there is a news article.
[12:26.010 --> 12:28.810]  This news article comes from abc7.com.
[12:28.810 --> 12:33.330]  I found this on a lot of different places, but this article was the best written and
[12:33.330 --> 12:36.730]  the most understandable and it kept to the point the most and it mentioned some things
[12:36.730 --> 12:39.130]  that a couple of other articles did not mention.
[12:39.130 --> 12:41.250]  Excuse my coughing.
[12:41.250 --> 12:44.850]  I'm going to get into the news article here right after I take a quick drink and then
[12:45.010 --> 12:46.010]  we will get into it.
[12:46.010 --> 12:53.950]  Oh, that was a long drink, but shit.
[12:53.950 --> 12:55.470]  Yeah, it was worth it.
[12:55.470 --> 12:56.950]  All right.
[12:56.950 --> 13:02.350]  This news article comes from abc7.com and it is written by a man named Greg Lee.
[13:02.350 --> 13:05.270]  This article was posted June 15th, 2015.
[13:05.270 --> 13:06.670]  It says Long Beach, California.
[13:06.670 --> 13:11.870]  A lawsuit was filed Monday by attorney Matthew Pappas on behalf of Sky High Holistic accusing
[13:11.870 --> 13:17.310]  Santa Ana Police Department, the city of Santa Ana and Santa Ana Mayor Miguel Pulido of taking
[13:17.310 --> 13:22.190]  bribes from marijuana dispensaries in exchange for favorable treatment.
[13:22.190 --> 13:26.350]  This following a controversial police raid at the marijuana dispensary on May 26th that
[13:26.350 --> 13:30.950]  was caught on surveillance video and shows police playing darts, an officer making demeaning
[13:30.950 --> 13:36.070]  remarks about an amputee and another officer eating what appears to be pot laced edibles.
[13:36.070 --> 13:40.430]  You guys, if you listen to the podcast, we watched the video last time and I'm 90% sure
[13:40.430 --> 13:43.430]  that that dude ate an edible right off of the shelf.
[13:43.430 --> 13:45.310]  Two cops ate edibles right off the shelves.
[13:45.310 --> 13:47.390]  I'll continue with the article.
[13:47.390 --> 13:51.230]  It says it's deplorable that city officials and people seeking financial gain would use
[13:51.230 --> 13:54.950]  the police to accomplish their self-serving goals, Pappas said.
[13:54.950 --> 13:59.430]  At a news conference in Long Beach, Pappas outlined the lawsuit he filed in federal court.
[13:59.430 --> 14:04.110]  The suit alleges that Padillo and other city employees favorited certain dispensaries over
[14:04.110 --> 14:05.110]  others.
[14:05.110 --> 14:09.310]  The city of Santa Ana used a lottery system to select 20 pot shops to operate legally
[14:09.310 --> 14:11.510]  under a new voter approved plan.
[14:11.510 --> 14:17.430]  The lawsuit alleges that at least one dispensary which paid Palito was selected.
[14:17.430 --> 14:21.110]  This dispensary paid for their fucking spot in the lottery, which is shitty.
[14:21.110 --> 14:25.070]  This dude allegedly, allegedly, I have to use the word allegedly, this dude allegedly
[14:25.070 --> 14:27.430]  took the damn money.
[14:27.430 --> 14:28.710]  The article goes on.
[14:28.710 --> 14:32.670]  Sky High Holistic did not win a spot in the lottery and its patients allege that because
[14:32.670 --> 14:36.670]  Palito and other city employees had financial ties with competing marijuana dispensaries,
[14:36.670 --> 14:40.990]  they used their positions to close down the competition, including including shutting
[14:40.990 --> 14:44.350]  down power and water services, the suit said.
[14:44.350 --> 14:48.070]  Pappas released an edited surveillance video last week showing what the lawsuit describes
[14:48.070 --> 14:51.710]  as excessive and unreasonable actions by police officers during the raid.
[14:51.710 --> 14:56.590]  And I will agree with both of those statements, excessive and unreasonable.
[14:56.590 --> 15:01.670]  The suit said that the suit said officers caused more than $100,000 to video surveillance
[15:01.670 --> 15:05.470]  equipment, safes, furniture, doors and other property.
[15:05.470 --> 15:09.310]  State internal investigation by the Santa Ana Police Department is ongoing.
[15:09.310 --> 15:16.750]  Retired LAPD Deputy Chief Stephen Downing echoed at the accusations at the news conference
[15:16.750 --> 15:17.750]  Monday.
[15:17.750 --> 15:19.390]  Police officers should not behave that way.
[15:19.390 --> 15:21.790]  It was unprofessional, Downing said.
[15:21.790 --> 15:26.910]  Palito released the video statement Monday afternoon in response to the lawsuit.
[15:26.910 --> 15:31.310]  These allegations are unequivocally false and the city will be responding to this lawsuit.
[15:31.310 --> 15:35.750]  He also said he has no financial interest or stake in any dispensary.
[15:35.750 --> 15:37.990]  This article was from the Associated Press.
[15:37.990 --> 15:39.870]  The Associated Press did contribute to this article.
[15:39.870 --> 15:42.250]  I have to mention that part at the end.
[15:42.250 --> 15:44.210]  So they are suing.
[15:44.210 --> 15:45.990]  They are going to file a lawsuit.
[15:45.990 --> 15:50.030]  They have filed a lawsuit against the cops that did this shit.
[15:50.030 --> 15:52.670]  So hopefully they don't get away with this.
[15:52.670 --> 15:54.550]  Hopefully this sets a new standard.
[15:54.550 --> 15:58.390]  You know, maybe this will make a difference.
[15:58.390 --> 16:01.870]  We can't have cops raiding places and eating edibles.
[16:01.870 --> 16:04.590]  So they did over $100,000 in damage.
[16:04.590 --> 16:09.150]  I hope they sue these guys for what, like three or four times that?
[16:09.150 --> 16:12.190]  Because you're going to have to fix it and then you're going to have to recoup your losses.
[16:12.190 --> 16:15.390]  You're going to have to catch up from all the business that you've missed.
[16:15.390 --> 16:18.390]  Yeah, I hope they sue him for at least three or four times this part.
[16:18.390 --> 16:19.390]  All right.
[16:19.390 --> 16:22.550]  I'm going to move on to another news article here.
[16:22.550 --> 16:23.550]  Which one is next?
[16:23.550 --> 16:26.610]  All right, here we go.
[16:26.610 --> 16:28.570]  This one is from right here at home.
[16:28.570 --> 16:31.370]  The Pueblo Chieftain.
[16:31.370 --> 16:37.410]  This one says Colorado workers can be fired for using pot off duty.
[16:37.410 --> 16:38.730]  This article is from Denver.
[16:38.730 --> 16:41.210]  It's written by Kristen Wyatt of the Associated Press.
[16:41.210 --> 16:45.010]  It says pot may be legal in Colorado, but you can still be fired for using it.
[16:45.010 --> 16:48.570]  The state Supreme Court ruled five to one Monday that a medical marijuana patient who
[16:48.570 --> 16:51.570]  was fired for failing a drug test cannot get his job back.
[16:51.570 --> 16:56.010]  The case was being watched closely by employers and pot smokers in states that have legalized
[16:56.010 --> 16:58.650]  medical or recreational marijuana.
[16:58.650 --> 17:01.610]  Colorado became the fourth state in which courts have ruled against medical marijuana
[17:01.610 --> 17:03.650]  patients fired for pot use.
[17:03.650 --> 17:08.570]  Supreme Courts in California, Montana, and Washington State have made similar rulings.
[17:08.570 --> 17:11.050]  So I'm going to jump in here for a minute.
[17:11.050 --> 17:15.770]  This article kind of frustrated a lot of people, but honestly, nothing has changed with this
[17:15.770 --> 17:16.770]  new ruling.
[17:16.770 --> 17:20.450]  Colorado has always been an at-will state, which means you can be fired for anything
[17:20.450 --> 17:21.690]  or nothing.
[17:21.690 --> 17:23.170]  You don't have to be given a reason.
[17:23.170 --> 17:24.610]  Your boss can walk up and say, guess what?
[17:24.610 --> 17:25.610]  You're fired.
[17:26.210 --> 17:27.210]  You get a paycheck.
[17:27.210 --> 17:28.850]  So at any minute, you can be fired for no reason.
[17:28.850 --> 17:31.090]  It's an at-will state.
[17:31.090 --> 17:39.090]  So even if they did find cannabis in your system and it was legal, they could still
[17:39.090 --> 17:40.090]  fire you if they wanted to.
[17:40.090 --> 17:41.610]  They could just say, ha ha, you're fired.
[17:41.610 --> 17:43.690]  But all right, let me get back into the article.
[17:43.690 --> 17:44.690]  Where the hell was I?
[17:44.690 --> 17:45.690]  All right.
[17:45.690 --> 17:48.850]  The Colorado worker, Brandon Coates, is a quadriplegic who was fired by Dish Network
[17:48.850 --> 17:52.130]  after failing a drug test in 2010.
[17:52.130 --> 17:55.530]  The company agreed that Coates wasn't high on the job, but they said they have a zero
[17:55.530 --> 17:57.890]  tolerance drug policy.
[17:57.890 --> 18:01.450]  Coates argued that his pot smoking was allowed under a state law intended to protect employees
[18:01.450 --> 18:04.530]  from being fired for illegal activities off the clock.
[18:04.530 --> 18:09.930]  Coates didn't use marijuana at work, but pot's intoxicating chemical, THC, holy crap, excuse
[18:09.930 --> 18:14.210]  me, pot's intoxicating chemical, THC, can stay in the system for weeks.
[18:14.210 --> 18:15.730]  And once again, these guys used chemical.
[18:15.730 --> 18:19.770]  I don't think the word chemical is appropriate there, but we'll just let them do their thing.
[18:19.770 --> 18:20.770]  They are professionals.
[18:21.770 --> 18:23.490]  I'm going to go on with the article.
[18:23.490 --> 18:27.490]  The Colorado justice ruled that because marijuana is illegal under federal law, Coates' use
[18:27.490 --> 18:31.250]  of the drug couldn't be considered legal off-duty activity.
[18:31.250 --> 18:35.770]  There's no exception for marijuana use for medicinal purposes or for marijuana use conducted
[18:35.770 --> 18:38.410]  in accordance with state law, the court wrote.
[18:38.410 --> 18:42.250]  Coates and his lawyers said after the ruling that the decision at least clarified the matters
[18:42.250 --> 18:43.530]  for workers.
[18:43.530 --> 18:48.550]  Although I'm very disappointed today, I hope that my case has brought the issue of use
[18:48.550 --> 18:53.670]  of medical marijuana and employment to light, Coates said in a statement.
[18:53.670 --> 18:58.430]  Attorneys for Tisch Network and the state of Colorado, which filed a brief in support
[18:58.430 --> 19:01.430]  of the company, were not immediately available for comment.
[19:01.430 --> 19:04.550]  23 states and Washington DC allow medical marijuana.
[19:04.550 --> 19:10.270]  Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington state, and Washington DC have legalized recreational
[19:10.270 --> 19:14.590]  sales though court cases so far have involved medical patients.
[19:14.590 --> 19:18.790]  The Colorado constitution specifically states that employers don't have to amend their policies
[19:18.790 --> 19:23.230]  to accommodate employees' marijuana use.
[19:23.230 --> 19:27.630]  Coates was paralyzed in a car crash as a teenager and has been a medical marijuana patient since
[19:27.630 --> 19:31.590]  2009, when he discovered that pot helped calm violent muscle spasms.
[19:31.590 --> 19:35.550]  He was a telephone operator with Ditch for three years before he failed a random drug
[19:35.550 --> 19:38.110]  test in 2010 and was fired.
[19:38.110 --> 19:44.270]  He said he told his supervisor in advance that he would probably fail the drug test.
[19:44.270 --> 19:46.750]  So big shout out to, what's his name?
[19:46.750 --> 19:47.750]  Brandon Coates.
[19:47.750 --> 19:48.750]  Was that the guy's name?
[19:48.750 --> 19:49.750]  I read it so quickly.
[19:49.750 --> 19:50.750]  Yeah.
[19:50.750 --> 19:51.750]  Brandon Coates.
[19:51.750 --> 19:52.750]  Big shout out to this guy.
[19:52.750 --> 19:54.830]  He did lose his job, but he tried to stand up for himself and he took it like a champ,
[19:54.830 --> 19:55.830]  dude.
[19:55.830 --> 19:57.190]  He said, well, shit, at least we know now.
[19:57.190 --> 19:59.590]  At least it's not an ambiguous law.
[19:59.590 --> 20:01.790]  So I'm going to jump in right now and say something to you guys.
[20:01.790 --> 20:04.630]  I am on Periscope while I'm recording this podcast.
[20:04.630 --> 20:08.870]  I am on an application called Periscope, where it's a video app where people are just watching
[20:08.870 --> 20:11.590]  me record and they're throwing comments and questions at me.
[20:11.590 --> 20:16.710]  And I just want to tell them I'm not watching the comments right now, you guys.
[20:16.710 --> 20:17.710]  I'm just doing the podcast.
[20:17.710 --> 20:19.510]  I'm focused on this part.
[20:19.510 --> 20:22.390]  If I need some questions to fill in some part of the show, I may look to you guys for a
[20:22.390 --> 20:25.670]  question or two, but I'm keeping away from the Periscope chat.
[20:25.670 --> 20:27.510]  Sorry if it feels like I've been ignoring you.
[20:27.510 --> 20:31.330]  I'm pretty focused on the podcast over here and getting this part done well.
[20:31.330 --> 20:33.230]  So I'm going to move on to one more news article.
[20:33.230 --> 20:35.150]  Let's see how long we've been recording here.
[20:35.150 --> 20:36.150]  All right, perfect.
[20:36.150 --> 20:39.910]  Yeah, I got time for one more news article.
[20:39.910 --> 20:41.430]  Thank you guys for watching on Periscope.
[20:41.430 --> 20:43.030]  If you are watching that, I do appreciate that.
[20:43.030 --> 20:45.190]  I just don't want to be rude and make you think I'm ignoring you.
[20:45.190 --> 20:46.870]  I'm just trying to stay with the show here.
[20:46.870 --> 20:49.870]  All right, so this next article, I found this.
[20:49.870 --> 20:52.110]  I apologize also for all the throat clearing, you guys.
[20:52.110 --> 20:55.390]  I do fat dabs and I drink caffeine and then I talk for 20 minutes straight and then the
[20:55.390 --> 20:56.390]  throat just goes to shit.
[20:56.390 --> 21:04.710]  I'm going to take a big chug of water and hopefully it'll help out.
[21:04.710 --> 21:05.710]  Shout out to water.
[21:05.710 --> 21:07.030]  I got to love that shit.
[21:07.030 --> 21:12.070]  All right, so this article comes from The Cannabis and it is written by, of course,
[21:12.070 --> 21:15.230]  written by our good friend, Ricardo Baca.
[21:15.230 --> 21:20.790]  And it got my attention because it says, Oregon police compare piles of weed to a voodoo donut
[21:20.790 --> 21:23.430]  as visual aid and they actually do this.
[21:23.430 --> 21:28.190]  It says, if you're in Oregon and passionate about marijuana reform, Wednesday is legitimately
[21:28.190 --> 21:30.030]  a mammoth day.
[21:30.030 --> 21:34.870]  Starting July 1st, adults can possess and use, grow and share cannabis in Oregon.
[21:34.870 --> 21:36.670]  The shops won't be open just yet.
[21:36.670 --> 21:38.330]  That comes in the fall, officials think.
[21:38.330 --> 21:44.250]  But July 1st will represent to many the beginning of a new era in the Pacific Northwest state.
[21:44.250 --> 21:47.970]  But how much marijuana will a person be able to legally possess in Oregon?
[21:47.970 --> 21:52.730]  As our handy Oregon marijuana guide says, anyone over 21 in Oregon can possess up to
[21:52.730 --> 21:58.730]  eight ounces of usable marijuana, such as dried buds at home and up to one ounce outside
[21:58.730 --> 22:00.370]  of the home.
[22:00.370 --> 22:05.090]  But especially since weed is coming out of a very dark and grow closet in Oregon, an
[22:05.090 --> 22:10.530]  average pot lender, Portlander, sorry, might not know how much cannabis makes up an ounce
[22:10.530 --> 22:12.170]  or an eight or eight ounces.
[22:12.170 --> 22:13.170]  Okay, sorry.
[22:13.170 --> 22:14.170]  This article is written.
[22:14.170 --> 22:15.770]  It's all squished into one little frame here.
[22:15.770 --> 22:17.690]  Trying to read it right though.
[22:17.690 --> 22:21.330]  And perhaps they don't have a laboratory grade digitally calibrated scale on their desk drawer
[22:21.330 --> 22:22.330]  either.
[22:22.330 --> 22:23.330]  Oh, they should.
[22:23.330 --> 22:24.730]  If you're in Colorado, everyone's got a digi scale now.
[22:24.730 --> 22:28.050]  But then it says, fear not, legal weed aficionados.
[22:28.050 --> 22:29.290]  The Portland police are here to help.
[22:29.290 --> 22:33.450]  In a very straightforward and almost sweetly maternal blog, the department encourages community
[22:33.450 --> 22:37.130]  members to be responsible and considerate with recreational marijuana.
[22:37.130 --> 22:39.650]  They tell people that stone driving is a crime.
[22:39.650 --> 22:43.530]  Public consumption could result in a citation and bringing Washington bought weed into Oregon
[22:43.530 --> 22:45.450]  is a federal no, no.
[22:45.450 --> 22:49.450]  With that last note being a bit of a turnaround from the department's previous statements.
[22:49.450 --> 22:51.570]  So they must've went back on something they said earlier.
[22:51.570 --> 22:53.250]  We'll have to research that.
[22:53.250 --> 22:58.210]  So the best part of the Portland police memo, the visual aid that compares a pile of weed
[22:58.210 --> 23:03.010]  to a voodoo donut, one of the state's most celebrated edibles, which is not, of course,
[23:03.570 --> 23:04.570]  is not infused.
[23:04.570 --> 23:06.290]  It's one of the most popular snacks in Portland.
[23:06.290 --> 23:08.850]  If you ever go there, you have to have a voodoo donut.
[23:08.850 --> 23:10.450]  It is definitely super popular.
[23:10.450 --> 23:12.010]  All my friends in Portland always talk about it.
[23:12.010 --> 23:13.490]  I hate you guys that are eating them right now.
[23:13.490 --> 23:14.490]  Send me one.
[23:14.490 --> 23:15.490]  Anyway.
[23:15.490 --> 23:17.250]  So it says, so how much weed makes up an ounce?
[23:17.250 --> 23:20.650]  The legal amount you'll be able to have on your person in Oregon, about the size of a
[23:20.650 --> 23:22.770]  donut, if not a little bigger.
[23:22.770 --> 23:27.530]  So imagine that you guys in Oregon, you're allowed to have a donut pile sized amount
[23:27.530 --> 23:28.530]  of weed.
[23:28.530 --> 23:31.250]  So if you get pulled over by the cops and you got some weed on you, they're like, how
[23:31.250 --> 23:32.250]  much weed you got?
[23:32.490 --> 23:33.490]  This much.
[23:33.490 --> 23:37.250]  Is that cop going to go to his car and pull out his donut and fucking set the donuts?
[23:37.250 --> 23:38.890]  Cause you know, the cops got a donut on the car.
[23:38.890 --> 23:42.530]  Is he going to go get a donut and set that donut down and set it next to your urban?
[23:42.530 --> 23:44.370]  Be like, Hey, I think you're cool, bro.
[23:44.370 --> 23:46.410]  You can get away with that.
[23:46.410 --> 23:47.410]  That's going to be fucking funny.
[23:47.410 --> 23:48.410]  All right.
[23:48.410 --> 23:49.410]  And then it says, what about eight ounces?
[23:49.410 --> 23:54.090]  The legal amount you're able to have at home in Oregon, about the size of a pile of donuts.
[23:54.090 --> 23:57.210]  It doesn't completely dwarf the donut.
[23:57.210 --> 23:58.210]  He'd be able to climb.
[23:58.210 --> 24:01.090]  Oh, he'd be able to climb that pile of weed if he could climb.
[24:01.090 --> 24:03.570]  So you'd have eight donuts worth of weed, right?
[24:03.570 --> 24:05.890]  If you could have eight ounces, you'd have about eight donuts.
[24:05.890 --> 24:08.970]  So you'd have a dozen donuts plus two extra worth of weed.
[24:08.970 --> 24:11.930]  So just visualize that next time you want to know how much weed you can carry around
[24:11.930 --> 24:12.930]  in Portland.
[24:12.930 --> 24:13.930]  This is weird.
[24:13.930 --> 24:14.930]  All right.
[24:14.930 --> 24:18.410]  The article goes on to say it's a genius ploy on the police's part and the inclusion of
[24:18.410 --> 24:20.810]  donuts inside official police marketing materials.
[24:20.810 --> 24:24.170]  Surely isn't lost on anyone checking out the truly modern graphic.
[24:24.170 --> 24:25.170]  It takes us back.
[24:25.170 --> 24:28.970]  In fact, to when Denver's police had some four 20 friendly fun on their own when they
[24:28.970 --> 24:32.490]  dropped a smart hip hop reference on their official Twitter account on this last four
[24:32.490 --> 24:33.490]  20 weekend.
[24:33.490 --> 24:37.850]  And I think I remember that they said, uh, we see you rolling and we ain't hating, but
[24:37.850 --> 24:41.530]  then they talked about all the rules that you had to follow to smoke weed in Colorado.
[24:41.530 --> 24:42.730]  All right.
[24:42.730 --> 24:46.370]  So the article goes on to say Portland and Denver will share more than just legal weed
[24:46.370 --> 24:51.690]  on July 1st in December, 2013, the city's beloved voodoo donuts open its first shop
[24:51.690 --> 24:54.370]  outside of Oregon in Denver, of course.
[24:54.370 --> 24:58.370]  So the next time I'm in Denver, I'm definitely going to go grab myself from some voodoo donuts.
[24:58.370 --> 25:00.690]  Even if there's not a line, there's always a line at that bitch.
[25:00.690 --> 25:01.690]  All right.
[25:01.690 --> 25:02.690]  So shout out to the cannabis.
[25:02.690 --> 25:05.090]  Uh, thanks for letting me read articles from there.
[25:05.090 --> 25:08.610]  So be careful, you guys, if you go to Oregon, make sure to get some donuts and that way
[25:08.610 --> 25:11.410]  you can measure how much cannabis you can legally possess.
[25:11.410 --> 25:16.490]  You can have one donut on your person or eight donuts worth of weed at your home.
[25:16.490 --> 25:18.370]  Let's see how long we've been recording.
[25:18.370 --> 25:19.810]  I might start wrapping this up.
[25:19.810 --> 25:20.810]  Yeah.
[25:20.810 --> 25:21.810]  We're going to start closing up the show, dude.
[25:21.810 --> 25:23.730]  Uh, let's start closing this up.
[25:23.730 --> 25:24.730]  What do I got?
[25:24.730 --> 25:25.890]  I got some notes somewhere here.
[25:25.890 --> 25:26.890]  I know I got them.
[25:26.890 --> 25:27.890]  I did that.
[25:28.410 --> 25:29.410]  I did that.
[25:29.410 --> 25:30.410]  I did that.
[25:30.410 --> 25:32.090]  Um, let's see.
[25:32.090 --> 25:35.130]  Somebody told me something that really, uh, that really stuck to my head.
[25:35.130 --> 25:37.850]  They said a good ganja farmer will never put something off for tomorrow.
[25:37.850 --> 25:40.250]  If you see it needs to be done today, get in there and do it.
[25:40.250 --> 25:42.690]  That's the difference between growing top shelf buds and mids.
[25:42.690 --> 25:44.970]  And I've never agreed with a statement more.
[25:44.970 --> 25:49.170]  That's definitely something that I agree with.
[25:49.170 --> 25:51.970]  So, uh, you guys, Spencer should be on a show pretty soon.
[25:51.970 --> 25:55.930]  I'm going to do a show about, uh, improving your garden pretty soon.
[25:55.970 --> 25:59.850]  We're going to do, I'm going to try to find a photographer to come on here and talk to
[25:59.850 --> 26:02.410]  us about cannabis photography.
[26:02.410 --> 26:06.770]  If you are in, if you're local to me and you're a cannabis photographer, I would love for
[26:06.770 --> 26:10.730]  you to come on the show and teach my listeners how to take better pictures of their ganja
[26:10.730 --> 26:11.730]  plants.
[26:11.730 --> 26:15.450]  I take pretty decent pictures, but I don't think I am an experienced enough photographer
[26:15.450 --> 26:18.010]  to come on here and teach everybody how to do it.
[26:18.010 --> 26:21.330]  Uh, we're also going to talk about ways to improve your crop.
[26:21.330 --> 26:22.890]  I think I said that Spencer will be on here.
[26:22.890 --> 26:24.850]  That'll probably be an episode or two.
[26:24.850 --> 26:27.450]  We've been talking about what we're going to do, trying to schedule that.
[26:27.450 --> 26:29.050]  That dude is heavily scheduled.
[26:29.050 --> 26:31.010]  Big shout out to Maddie.
[26:31.010 --> 26:32.170]  Maddie invited me over tonight.
[26:32.170 --> 26:34.730]  Maddie made blueberry muffins that were freaking delicious.
[26:34.730 --> 26:38.230]  Uh, Maddie actually ran a batch of hash for me.
[26:38.230 --> 26:40.770]  She took some of my nugs and she made me some beautiful shatter.
[26:40.770 --> 26:42.690]  Let me show you what she did.
[26:42.690 --> 26:43.690]  Let me show you what she did.
[26:43.690 --> 26:46.250]  If you're watching on Periscope, I'm going to hold this up to the cam.
[26:46.250 --> 26:47.250]  Nope.
[26:47.250 --> 26:48.250]  It's stuck.
[26:48.250 --> 26:50.730]  It's over here.
[26:50.730 --> 26:51.730]  It's so stuck.
[26:51.730 --> 26:52.730]  Here we go.
[26:52.730 --> 26:53.730]  Maddie did that.
[26:54.010 --> 26:55.050]  So big shout out to Maddie.
[26:55.050 --> 26:56.770]  She made some super fire shatter for me.
[26:56.770 --> 26:57.770]  I appreciate that.
[26:57.770 --> 26:58.770]  Let's see.
[26:58.770 --> 27:00.650]  I got a couple of shout outs to give.
[27:00.650 --> 27:02.250]  I want to give a huge shout out to the spot.
[27:02.250 --> 27:06.170]  I want to give a big shout out to everybody that has started listening to the podcast.
[27:06.170 --> 27:07.170]  You found me on Periscope.
[27:07.170 --> 27:08.850]  I really appreciate that.
[27:08.850 --> 27:12.530]  Also big shout out to everybody who is listening on Periscope and watching on Periscope right
[27:12.530 --> 27:13.530]  now.
[27:13.530 --> 27:14.530]  It's super kind of you.
[27:14.530 --> 27:15.530]  I will be back.
[27:15.530 --> 27:19.410]  This episode is going to come out on Thursday, so I will be back Monday with the whole fresh
[27:19.410 --> 27:20.410]  episode.
[27:20.410 --> 27:21.410]  I got a couple more news articles.
[27:21.410 --> 27:23.230]  I got some things I want to talk to you about.
[27:23.230 --> 27:25.190]  So you guys, big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[27:25.190 --> 27:28.230]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[29:15.050 --> 29:19.930]  of the sour D, our lead gone like a falcon on the balcony.
[29:19.930 --> 29:24.090]  I'm trippin' opening the fresh job, little Skywalker choking on the death star.
[29:24.090 --> 29:29.450]  Spoiled bragger, email coil rapper, oil shatter rapper, spitting hotter than my oil spatter.
[29:29.450 --> 29:34.930]  My whole clique keeps blowing all the glass, growing all the grass and smoking all your
[29:34.930 --> 29:35.930]  hash.
[29:35.930 --> 29:40.930]  It's a green brush, but we ain't in it just for cash, we're in it for the love.
[29:40.930 --> 29:43.050]  I'm in the kitchen and I'm frying chicken.
[29:43.050 --> 29:46.050]  And watch out if you're black or you speak in Spanish
[29:46.050 --> 29:49.050]  Cause that racist law was made to attack and defeat Hispanics
[29:49.050 --> 29:52.050]  It's propaganda, we laugh in a reef of madness
[29:52.050 --> 29:55.050]  But the privatized prisons will profit when people vanish
[29:55.050 --> 29:58.050]  That's why I feel like the loneliest dude
[29:58.050 --> 30:01.050]  The only one out of my friends without a Mobius tube
[30:01.050 --> 30:16.080]  It's rude, I don't collect but we ain't in it just for cash
[30:16.080 --> 30:19.080]  We're in it for the love, till death dusts the Nash
[30:19.080 --> 30:22.080]  Niggas ain't smart, we just learnin' to be humble
[30:36.700 --> 30:41.290]  I'm on that other shit, I'm on that other shit
[30:43.290 --> 30:46.290]  Death in your quave with the eggs man, I seen you on some other shit
[30:46.290 --> 30:49.290]  Fabulous, makes me wanna beam aboard the mothership
[30:49.290 --> 30:52.290]  From Minitube Mafia and Darby Guns, it's a takeover
[30:52.290 --> 30:55.290]  Spittin' fire like my man Bates, glass flamethrower
[30:55.290 --> 30:58.290]  Smokin' in my bathtub, cause fuck the damn club
[30:58.290 --> 31:01.290]  I'm home alone, takin' dabs out my handbug
[31:01.290 --> 31:04.290]  It's all American, no phony-ish, my only wish is
[31:04.290 --> 31:07.290]  I had a never-ending supply in my Bertone dish
[31:07.290 --> 31:10.290]  Stayin' at the Radisson, takin' dabs with Addison
[31:10.290 --> 31:13.290]  San Francisco, stop to meet with Julio and Davakin
[31:13.290 --> 31:16.290]  We link with Chad and them, stayin' in San Diego
[31:16.290 --> 31:19.290]  Backstage at the Bay Cup, blazin' with Danny Deco
[31:19.290 --> 31:22.290]  Peace to Maguito, tofin' the tote daddy
[31:22.290 --> 31:25.290]  Funkmaster Kush, let's twist up a bush and smoke fatties
[31:25.290 --> 31:28.290]  And big ups to Weezy for like every show
[31:28.290 --> 31:31.290]  You seem to always save our ass, yo, wherever we go
[31:31.290 --> 31:34.290]  My buddy Chuggie actin' funny off a hubby bar
[31:34.290 --> 31:37.290]  Lookin' like a poo-bear with his head stuck in a honey jar
[31:37.290 --> 31:40.290]  H-E, Ty Sweet, hit the hard rock
[31:40.290 --> 31:43.290]  Rockstars carving out our spot from the barstaff
[31:43.290 --> 31:46.290]  My life's one big oil adventure
[31:46.290 --> 31:49.290]  I'm blayin' honeys and makin' monies like Coil Condenser
[31:49.290 --> 31:52.290]  My whole clique keeps blowin' all the glass
[31:52.290 --> 31:55.290]  Growin' all the grass and smokin' all your hash
[31:56.290 --> 32:18.930]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community
[32:18.930 --> 32:21.930]  It's time for episode number 81 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[32:21.930 --> 32:24.930]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation
[32:24.930 --> 32:27.930]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower
[32:27.930 --> 32:30.930]  If you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber
[32:30.930 --> 32:33.930]  If you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis
[32:33.930 --> 32:36.930]  This, my friends, is the podcast for you
[32:36.930 --> 32:39.930]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff, thanks again for joining me
[32:39.930 --> 32:42.930]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shoutout to the Mystic Roots Band
[32:43.930 --> 32:46.930]  For letting me use their music on the show
[32:46.930 --> 32:49.930]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew
[32:49.930 --> 32:52.930]  How's everybody doing today? It is the first of the month
[32:52.930 --> 32:55.930]  Before we get too far into the show, let me give you guys a warning
[32:55.930 --> 32:58.930]  There may be some loud pops and sizzles in the background here
[32:58.930 --> 33:01.930]  It's the first of July, everybody's getting prepared for the fourth of July
[33:01.930 --> 33:04.930]  Well, that music was loud, I'm sorry
[33:04.930 --> 33:07.930]  It's the first of July as we record, everybody in my neighborhood is already begun celebrating the fourth of July
[33:07.930 --> 33:10.930]  So you'll hear some M80s, some mortars go off
[33:10.930 --> 33:13.930]  All kinds of great shit happening in the background here as we record
[33:13.930 --> 33:16.930]  It's been scaring the shit out of me for the past couple of hours
[33:16.930 --> 33:19.930]  I keep forgetting that it's right near the fourth of July
[33:19.930 --> 33:22.930]  And I keep hearing these loud booms and I want to get up and go look
[33:22.930 --> 33:25.930]  And every time I think, I'm going to go look, I realize that's just damn fireworks
[33:25.930 --> 33:28.930]  So at least I hope it's fireworks
[33:28.930 --> 33:31.930]  I kind of live in not the best neighborhood in the world
[33:31.930 --> 33:34.930]  So I like this time of year because then you can just really convince yourself that that boom was fireworks this one time
[33:34.930 --> 33:37.930]  So guys, thanks for joining me
[33:37.930 --> 33:40.930]  Happy first of the month, this will probably come out on Monday
[33:40.930 --> 33:43.930]  So that'll be, fuck I don't even know the date, whatever guys
[33:43.930 --> 33:46.930]  It'll be Monday, happy Monday as you listen to this
[33:46.930 --> 33:49.930]  Before we get too far, this podcast is brought to you by my good friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies

[34:26.930 --> 34:29.930]  Alright, let me also mention before we go too far
[34:29.930 --> 34:32.930]  I am on Periscope once again, there's an application called Periscope
[34:33.930 --> 34:36.930]  We can record everything live, I am broadcasting live to
[34:36.930 --> 34:39.930]  There are 10 people watching me right now, there'll be hopefully a few more by the end of the show
[34:39.930 --> 34:42.930]  If you ever want to watch me on Periscope
[34:42.930 --> 34:45.930]  I kind of record randomly, I don't set a good schedule
[34:45.930 --> 34:48.930]  I'm going to have to set a schedule so that I can get you guys on Periscope with me
[34:48.930 --> 34:51.930]  We'll start making a date of it, but right now to the people that are on Periscope watching
[34:51.930 --> 34:54.930]  You guys, I'm not going to pay attention to the comments until toward the end of the show
[34:54.930 --> 34:57.930]  I'm going to record about a 20 minute show
[34:57.930 --> 35:00.930]  And then I'll open it up for questions, and I will accept questions from my viewers
[35:01.930 --> 35:04.930]  So I'm going to have to make this a regular thing so that I can schedule this
[35:04.930 --> 35:07.930]  So that my friends and fans can get on here and listen at the proper time
[35:07.930 --> 35:10.930]  And watch me on Periscope and interact, but tonight
[35:10.930 --> 35:13.930]  This is kind of my test run, I didn't want to advertise that I was going to do this
[35:13.930 --> 35:16.930]  Because I didn't want to get bombarded and get overwhelmed
[35:16.930 --> 35:19.930]  But at the end of this podcast, once I do my news articles
[35:19.930 --> 35:22.930]  And talk about the email I received, I will open up the floor
[35:22.930 --> 35:25.930]  For questions from my Periscope viewers
[35:25.930 --> 35:28.930]  So let me keep the show going
[35:28.930 --> 35:31.930]  Much respect to the sponsors, to Hydro and Growing Supplies
[35:31.930 --> 35:34.930]  For making the show possible, they do help me out
[35:34.930 --> 35:37.930]  If you are interested in sponsoring the show, send me an email
[35:37.930 --> 35:40.930]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com, I'll get you all of the information that you need
[35:40.930 --> 35:43.930]  Let's see, where do we want to start?
[35:43.930 --> 35:46.930]  Actually, let's go
[35:46.930 --> 35:49.930]  It's the first of the month, I already mentioned that
[35:49.930 --> 35:52.930]  And I talked about the fireworks, I talked about Periscope
[35:52.930 --> 35:55.930]  So since it's the first of the month, let's jump right into this news article, here we go
[35:55.930 --> 35:58.930]  Today is the first of the month, and it is also the first day
[35:58.930 --> 36:01.930]  Let me just read the article to you
[36:01.930 --> 36:04.930]  It says, Oregon opens door to legal pot, retail sales still in the works
[36:04.930 --> 36:07.930]  This article is by Jeff Bernard from the Associated Press
[36:07.930 --> 36:10.930]  And of course, I found it on the Cannabis
[36:10.930 --> 36:13.930]  Shout out to our friends at the Cannabis
[36:13.930 --> 36:16.930]  And the article says, Williams, Oregon
[36:16.930 --> 36:19.930]  42 years after Oregon became the first state to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana
[36:19.930 --> 36:22.930]  The state is taking its first steps along a road
[36:22.930 --> 36:25.930]  Leading to state licensed stores selling limited amounts of it to anyone over 21
[36:25.930 --> 36:28.930]  Oregon has long been a pioneer on sensible marijuana policy
[36:28.930 --> 36:31.930]  Said Anthony Johnson, chief pioneer on Measure 91
[36:31.930 --> 36:34.930]  Which on Wednesday makes Oregon the fourth state to adopt laws
[36:34.930 --> 36:37.930]  Legalizing recreational use of cannabis for people old enough to drink
[36:37.930 --> 36:40.930]  That's right, you guys
[36:40.930 --> 36:43.930]  Today, July 1st, 2015
[36:43.930 --> 36:46.930]  The state of Oregon has legalized recreational cannabis for folks 21 and over
[36:46.930 --> 36:49.930]  It's a great thing, let's all celebrate that
[36:49.930 --> 36:52.930]  You know what, I haven't taken a dab on the show lately
[36:52.930 --> 36:55.930]  I think that is grounds to take a celebration dab
[36:55.930 --> 36:58.930]  So join me, I'm going to give you guys a couple seconds to get a dab ready
[36:58.930 --> 37:01.930]  I'm going to do a medium-sized dab here
[37:01.930 --> 37:04.930]  Not one of those big fat dabs I like to do
[37:04.930 --> 37:07.930]  Because I don't want to be choking on the show here, we've got a show to run
[37:07.930 --> 37:10.930]  So this dab I'm going to take is in celebration of all of my friends in Oregon
[37:10.930 --> 37:13.930]  Who can now smoke and possess recreational cannabis without worry of arrest
[37:13.930 --> 37:16.930]  Without any sort of trouble from the police
[37:16.930 --> 37:19.930]  I'm going to do a dab for you guys
[37:19.930 --> 37:22.930]  If you're on Periscope, do a dab with me
[37:22.930 --> 37:35.910]  If you're listening to the podcast, do a dab with me, join me
[37:35.910 --> 37:38.910]  Shout out to the Garden of Weeden for delicious dabs, I really appreciate that
[37:38.910 --> 37:41.910]  We'll continue with the article
[37:41.910 --> 37:44.910]  Anthony Johnson added, though he doesn't expect much increased demand for it
[37:44.910 --> 37:47.910]  He means for cannabis
[37:47.910 --> 37:50.910]  And then he goes on to say, smoking it in public is illegal
[37:50.910 --> 37:53.910]  But in Portland, police are discouraging residents from calling 911 to report pot smokers
[37:54.910 --> 37:57.910]  The Portland Chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
[37:57.910 --> 38:00.910]  Posted on its website that it would have a tent set up at the west side of the Burnside Bridge
[38:02.910 --> 38:05.910]  For a midnight countdown to the end of marijuana prohibition
[38:05.910 --> 38:08.910]  The site offers a big neon sign in the shape of Oregon
[38:08.910 --> 38:11.910]  As a background for selfies of revelers who light up
[38:11.910 --> 38:14.910]  Oh, I can just imagine that, you guys
[38:14.910 --> 38:17.910]  A big-ass sign shaped like Oregon with people just dabbing out and puffing down in front of it
[38:17.910 --> 38:20.910]  That's pretty great
[38:20.910 --> 38:23.910]  Let's continue with the article
[38:23.910 --> 38:26.910]  It says, adults will be allowed to possess up to a half a pound and grow four plants
[38:26.910 --> 38:29.910]  But not yet to buy or sell it
[38:29.910 --> 38:32.910]  It will be a few months to more than a year before it is legal to sell
[38:32.910 --> 38:35.910]  And then only with a state permit
[38:35.910 --> 38:38.910]  So right now it says adults will be allowed to possess up to a pound
[38:38.910 --> 38:41.910]  And they'll be allowed to grow up to four plants
[38:41.910 --> 38:44.910]  We talked about the last episode
[38:44.910 --> 38:47.910]  That pound, or that half a pound, I'm sorry
[38:47.910 --> 38:50.910]  You're allowed to carry up to one ounce
[38:50.910 --> 38:53.910]  And just in case you were confused
[38:53.910 --> 38:56.910]  Oregon issued a nice little statement that showed you
[38:56.910 --> 38:59.910]  That one ounce of cannabis is approximately the size of one voodoo donut
[38:59.910 --> 39:02.910]  So that's how much you're allowed to carry around with you
[39:02.910 --> 39:05.910]  And the article goes on to say
[39:05.910 --> 39:08.910]  The legislature is considering
[39:08.910 --> 39:11.910]  A bill to allow medical marijuana dispensaries
[39:11.910 --> 39:14.910]  To start selling small amounts to anyone 21 and over on October 1st
[39:14.910 --> 39:17.910]  In order to get over the incongruity
[39:17.910 --> 39:20.910]  Of marijuana being legal to have it
[39:20.910 --> 39:23.910]  And grow, but not to buy
[39:23.910 --> 39:26.910]  Sorry I stumbled over that word you guys
[39:26.910 --> 39:29.910]  A state regulated retail system is not expected to be fully up and running until late next year
[39:29.910 --> 39:32.910]  Growers are expected to be able to start applying for licenses in January
[39:32.910 --> 39:35.910]  With permits for processors, wholesalers, and retailers
[39:35.910 --> 39:38.910]  Rolling out in succession
[39:38.910 --> 39:41.910]  Growers are already gearing up, particularly in southern Oregon
[39:41.910 --> 39:44.910]  Long known as a prime climate for outdoor growing
[39:44.910 --> 39:47.910]  Jackson County Building Services Director Kelly Madding said
[39:47.910 --> 39:50.910]  They have received 17 complaints over the past 6 months
[39:50.910 --> 39:53.910]  Of marijuana growers violating land use laws
[39:53.910 --> 39:56.910]  Trees along a creek were cut down
[39:56.910 --> 39:59.910]  And a vernal pool habitat for a protected species of freshwater shrimp was bulldozed
[39:59.910 --> 40:02.910]  Four citations have been issued
[40:02.910 --> 40:05.910]  Guys if you're going to grow cannabis and you're going to do it out in somebody's land
[40:05.910 --> 40:08.910]  Or out in some land, be aware of what you're doing
[40:08.910 --> 40:11.910]  Be mindful of what you're destroying
[40:11.910 --> 40:14.910]  Don't go bulldoze a lake, that's ridiculous
[40:14.910 --> 40:17.910]  Don't do that kind of shit
[40:17.910 --> 40:20.910]  And don't cut down a bunch of trees ridiculously and irresponsibly
[40:20.910 --> 40:23.910]  Especially on somebody else's land
[40:23.910 --> 40:26.910]  Pay attention to what you're doing
[40:26.910 --> 40:29.910]  Your profit and your cannabis crop comes second to our environment
[40:29.910 --> 40:32.910]  With the legalization of recreational marijuana
[40:32.910 --> 40:35.910]  I think we're seeing a move to our area by people who may be from out of state
[40:35.910 --> 40:38.910]  This is an update on our land use laws and our environmental protection
[40:38.910 --> 40:41.910]  Once a month, veteran medical marijuana growers and hopeful newbies gather
[40:41.910 --> 40:44.910]  In the Old Grange Hall in the community of Williams
[40:44.910 --> 40:47.910]  To hear the latest updates on the Legislature's process
[40:47.910 --> 40:50.910]  On framing regulations and tips
[40:50.910 --> 40:53.910]  On how to grow healthy, happy marijuana plants
[40:53.910 --> 40:56.910]  It's a really hostile business environment
[40:56.910 --> 40:59.910]  But things are improving, said Cedar Gray
[40:59.910 --> 41:02.910]  The Growers Guild President and a local home builder
[41:02.910 --> 41:09.870]  and hope to move into growing for retail. So today is the first day, but you cannot buy it
[41:09.870 --> 41:15.550]  in a store. And it's going to be a year before you're able to buy cannabis in a store, but you're
[41:15.550 --> 41:20.270]  able to grow it and it looks like you're able to give it away. So big shout out to Oregon.
[41:21.550 --> 41:25.470]  I'm proud of them. They're the fourth state to have recreational cannabis. We are on our way,
[41:25.470 --> 41:30.030]  you guys. There are only so many states left and they can't all fight us. So that takes me to
[41:30.830 --> 41:35.470]  another thing I wanted to read. This kind of drags me over. Where is it? I had it open on
[41:35.470 --> 41:38.750]  the computer here. I'll just find it again. You guys, I'm sorry. Here it is. All right.
[41:39.470 --> 41:45.310]  Somebody sent me an email and I answered half of their question on a previous episode,
[41:45.950 --> 41:49.630]  but I wasn't able to answer the full question because I hadn't had time to think about it.
[41:49.630 --> 41:53.790]  But now I've had time to think about it and Mike and I brainstormed on this a little bit.
[41:54.910 --> 41:58.270]  I'm going to read part of the question because I've already answered part of the question on
[41:58.270 --> 42:03.710]  the show. So this question says, what up Rasta Jeff? My name is Ash. I'm from Oregon and I love
[42:03.710 --> 42:07.470]  listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast while I'm working in my med garden. I think you
[42:07.470 --> 42:12.030]  give out some great information and tips, so I totally respect your judgment. Dude, awesome.
[42:12.030 --> 42:17.150]  Thanks for saying that. That is really kind of you. Thanks for, first of all, loving and listening to
[42:17.150 --> 42:21.150]  the show and thanks for listening to it while you work in your garden because I want to promote a
[42:21.150 --> 42:25.390]  good vibe while you're in your garden. So that's really cool. Second of all, thanks for respecting
[42:25.390 --> 42:30.670]  my judgment and noticing that I give out great tips. Respect is hard to earn and I appreciate
[42:30.670 --> 42:35.230]  that you respect me and you've got my respect in turn. So your question says, with Oregon about to
[42:35.230 --> 42:41.150]  turn recreational, I was interested in your opinion on niche business opportunities and how recreational
[42:41.150 --> 42:45.790]  might affect medical rules and regulations. And then I answered the second part of your question,
[42:45.790 --> 42:52.110]  which was about trim machines. Let me jump into the one part that I can answer without a lot of
[42:52.110 --> 42:57.710]  ranting. And then I have some that I wrote down on the other part. You said, how recreational
[42:57.710 --> 43:02.590]  might affect medical rules and regulations. Let me tell you that here in Colorado, when we rolled
[43:02.590 --> 43:07.950]  out recreational cannabis, it looks like we have turned our back on medical marijuana completely.
[43:07.950 --> 43:11.870]  We've given the finger to the medical marijuana patients. And this is not me. This is just how
[43:11.870 --> 43:15.870]  I feel about the industry. It looks like the industry does not care about medical marijuana
[43:15.870 --> 43:24.030]  anymore. There's more profit. There's more demand in recreational cannabis. So it feels like the
[43:24.030 --> 43:30.030]  medical side in Colorado is being forgotten and they're almost attempting to eliminate it,
[43:30.030 --> 43:35.870]  is what it feels like to me. It's being pushed away. So I feel that the medical rules are going
[43:35.870 --> 43:41.470]  to affect your area probably very similarly. The growers are going to see more profit in the
[43:41.470 --> 43:45.390]  recreational side of things and they'll start getting greedy and they'll stop giving to the
[43:45.390 --> 43:52.590]  patients like they have been. The compassion will go away. They're going to start raising prices
[43:52.590 --> 43:57.150]  and they're going to start selling everything on the commercial side of things instead of the
[43:57.150 --> 44:01.790]  medical side of things. That's what I predict. All right. Now I have to open up a couple of
[44:01.790 --> 44:05.790]  notes that I have in my computer here because I wrote a nice list of things. The other part of
[44:05.790 --> 44:11.950]  your question is what are niche businesses that I think might open up? Maybe some information or tips
[44:12.590 --> 44:19.150]  about since Oregon is going recreational. So I've got a list here. If I can close this one,
[44:19.150 --> 44:24.430]  I will be able to open the next thing. Here we go. I'm fighting with my computer while we're at this.
[44:24.430 --> 44:30.910]  All right. So businesses and business opportunities that will arise with recreational cannabis in your
[44:30.910 --> 44:37.230]  area. And this will go for everywhere, not just Oregon where it has just become recreational
[44:37.230 --> 44:41.630]  illegally, recreationally illegal. That was hard to say, but this will go along with everywhere
[44:41.630 --> 44:46.990]  where cannabis becomes available medically and recreationally. Businesses that I have seen pop up
[44:46.990 --> 44:52.270]  personally that are attached to cannabis, but this is not a cannabis related business. Say you're
[44:52.270 --> 44:55.630]  not wanting to be in the dispensary game. You don't want to work at a dispensary. You want to
[44:55.630 --> 45:03.230]  open another business. Here's a nice list of opportunities. Electricians, certified electricians
[45:03.230 --> 45:07.070]  are getting paid huge money. If you're an electrician and you're willing to work with
[45:07.070 --> 45:13.230]  a dispensary or a grow, you are making huge money right now. That's the first step I think.
[45:15.150 --> 45:20.190]  When we were able to grow medical cannabis here in Colorado, everybody built a grow room in their
[45:20.190 --> 45:24.510]  house. Everybody that had a MedCard. Somebody on Periscope just made a great recommendation,
[45:24.510 --> 45:29.470]  and that's the next one on my list. So electricians, everyone's going to need an
[45:29.470 --> 45:33.070]  electrician as soon as it goes commercial and everyone's allowed to grow four, or I keep saying
[45:33.070 --> 45:37.710]  commercial, recreational. As soon as it goes recreational, everyone's allowed to grow four
[45:37.710 --> 45:41.790]  plants in their house. So that means everyone's going to want to build a grow room. Most houses
[45:41.790 --> 45:45.630]  aren't equipped to run a couple thousand watt lights, so everyone's going to need an electrician.
[45:45.630 --> 45:49.550]  And then shit's going to go wrong and people are going to want to upgrade. So more electricians
[45:49.550 --> 45:55.630]  all the time. Following electricians would be HVAC technicians. All of the dispensaries have
[45:56.350 --> 46:02.270]  super fancy, super high-tech HVAC systems. If you could design state-of-the-art HVAC systems for
[46:02.270 --> 46:09.150]  grow facilities and or residential grows, that would be very useful. Also, construction crews
[46:09.150 --> 46:14.830]  that are familiar with grow room construction. If you had a crew that knew how to build a grow room,
[46:14.830 --> 46:19.390]  if you're a consultant and you can design a nice grow room and you can have a construction crew
[46:19.390 --> 46:23.630]  that knows what the goal is on building a grow room, that would be super helpful.
[46:24.270 --> 46:30.590]  So HVAC, electricians, and construction crews to design and build dispensary grows and personal
[46:30.590 --> 46:37.070]  grows. After that, photographers. I know that sounds crazy, but there are two or three photographers
[46:37.070 --> 46:41.790]  in the Colorado cannabis scene that if you told me right now, I need a photographer for cannabis,
[46:41.790 --> 46:46.430]  I would say, is it for like an event where we're photographing people or is it something where
[46:46.430 --> 46:49.550]  we're going to take pictures of plants? And if you said, and I'm going to give two shout outs
[46:49.550 --> 46:52.830]  here, I'm going to give two huge shout outs to two people. If you said, I want to take pictures
[46:52.830 --> 46:58.030]  of cannabis plants, I would definitely recommend a guy named Ripe Richard. He is the guy you want
[46:58.030 --> 47:02.430]  to take pictures of your ganja plants. And if you were taking pictures of a cannabis event where
[47:02.430 --> 47:07.550]  there are people and things happening, you want Kim Sidwell of Cannabis Camera. And they didn't
[47:07.550 --> 47:11.950]  pay me to say that. Those are just who I think of. So what you want to do is become that camera
[47:11.950 --> 47:16.750]  person, the photographer, man, photographer, woman in your area, and master the shit out of
[47:16.750 --> 47:23.630]  that and market yourself as the new industry photographer. Also, another good thing, lawyers,
[47:23.630 --> 47:29.950]  cannabis lawyers. If you can be a lawyer and focus on the cannabis industry and work on either
[47:29.950 --> 47:35.710]  dispensary rules or personal rules or caregiver rules or whatever, people are going to, there are
[47:35.710 --> 47:38.830]  all these new rules and people are going to fuck them up and go to jail and get themselves in
[47:38.830 --> 47:43.470]  trouble trying to mingle with the new rules. Be a lawyer, help those people out. If you're into
[47:43.470 --> 47:47.310]  that, I know that's a lot of schooling and you didn't, you can't just go to school tomorrow,
[47:47.310 --> 47:50.990]  but if you're a lawyer and you're looking for a new niche, this could be it for you.
[47:50.990 --> 47:56.030]  Also accountants, the dispensaries have a lot of money. They need an accountant,
[47:56.830 --> 48:01.390]  advertising teams. We need good marketing teams for the dispensaries. We need good
[48:01.390 --> 48:08.350]  advertising schemes and advertising campaigns for the dispensaries. Design teams to design the
[48:08.430 --> 48:12.350]  signs and our booths and things like that for the Cannabis Cup. We need those types of things.
[48:13.150 --> 48:17.870]  Testing facilities. If there's not a testing facility in your area, if Steep Hill Labs,
[48:17.870 --> 48:22.670]  if Steep Hill Haylent hasn't already moved in in your area, then open a testing facility. Or even
[48:22.670 --> 48:26.750]  if they're already there, open another testing facility. I like that I'm on Periscope and people
[48:26.750 --> 48:30.430]  are throwing up the ideas that I've got on my list here. That's a good one, bro. I see it and I've got
[48:30.430 --> 48:35.070]  it on my list. Where was I? Testing facilities, other ancillary businesses like head shops and
[48:35.070 --> 48:42.110]  grow stores, you guys. Like Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. Those guys are aiming at the outdoor and
[48:42.110 --> 48:48.190]  indoor farmer that is producing tomatoes, but this cannabis business is also boosting their sales
[48:48.190 --> 48:54.510]  ridiculously. So a grow store, a head shop. Most of the dispensaries have smoking gear. They have
[48:54.510 --> 48:58.910]  dab rigs. They have bongs. They have pipes. They have papers, but it's grossly overpriced in that,
[48:58.910 --> 49:04.190]  son of a bitch. If you opened up a head shop down the street from a dispensary and sold things
[49:04.190 --> 49:09.950]  at a decent markup, you would make money because people will know that this dispensary charges me
[49:09.950 --> 49:14.430]  good price for weed, ridiculous prices for glass. I'm going to go to the glass shop and buy
[49:14.430 --> 49:20.590]  my smoking accessories there. Somebody just wrote on Periscope, they said security. Security guards
[49:20.590 --> 49:24.750]  are always needed at the dispensaries. We need security guards for our grows, for the dispensaries,
[49:25.390 --> 49:31.630]  for all of our businesses. Packaging. If you know how to make packaging, if you can design packaging,
[49:31.630 --> 49:35.470]  if you are a packaging person, that sort of stuff is needed in our industry.
[49:36.270 --> 49:42.110]  Something that people overlook is clothing. People, cannabis clothing, locally aimed cannabis
[49:42.110 --> 49:46.990]  clothing sells. If you've got your state, if you can make your state flag into something
[49:47.550 --> 49:52.990]  or a kind of cannabis-y, then that will sell in your area. Web design. All of the dispensaries
[49:52.990 --> 49:57.310]  need some sort of web design. Something that Colorado specializes in, we have something
[49:57.310 --> 50:01.870]  called a compliance specialist. If you run a dispensary or work in a dispensary or own a
[50:01.870 --> 50:06.830]  dispensary, everything has to be done under a certain set of rules that are set by the MED.
[50:06.830 --> 50:11.310]  You need one or two people that know all of those rules. If you ask them a question,
[50:11.310 --> 50:15.230]  it's their job to go in the office and get the book and figure out that rule. That's
[50:15.230 --> 50:19.950]  your compliance specialist. He needs to be finding out all of the new rules as they come out.
[50:19.950 --> 50:25.310]  He needs to be walking through the grow, through the sales area, through all of the dispensary and
[50:25.310 --> 50:30.030]  making sure that everything is under compliance so that if the inspectors come in, you are cool
[50:30.030 --> 50:34.830]  and legit and he keeps you out of trouble. The dispensaries need assistance from everywhere.
[50:35.790 --> 50:41.150]  Also, a taxi service of some sort would be really cool. Or if you can open, this is the obvious one,
[50:41.150 --> 50:45.230]  if you can open a smoking club, that would be cool as shit, but the rules are always going to
[50:45.230 --> 50:50.670]  be strict for that sort of stuff. What I have seen is a lot of smoking buses. They have the
[50:50.670 --> 50:54.110]  cannabis tour bus because it's a little bit different. I don't know the rules on it. You
[50:54.110 --> 50:58.750]  have to find out that in your area, but a taxi service of some sort would be really cool.
[50:58.750 --> 51:03.470]  Transportation for intoxicated people makes you look good and it's a good business.
[51:04.510 --> 51:08.590]  What else do we have? Oh, there's a service around here that actually hires specifically
[51:08.590 --> 51:13.150]  for dispensaries. It's a temp agency and you go and apply and you have to get your med badge.
[51:13.150 --> 51:17.070]  And once you've got your med badge, they send you to a dispensary and you work there and it
[51:17.070 --> 51:21.630]  could lead to permanent employment, just like a normal job at a normal temp agency.
[51:21.630 --> 51:26.270]  And they're designed specifically for the cannabis industry. So you could open your
[51:26.270 --> 51:31.150]  own temp agency to hire people for the dispensaries so that dispensary owners and
[51:31.150 --> 51:36.750]  managers don't have to spend their day interviewing people. They pay you to do that. You send these
[51:36.750 --> 51:41.710]  people to the dispensary, they work, they get paid a certain amount of money. And then you take a
[51:41.710 --> 51:46.110]  dollar, whatever, you make sure that they get paid minimum wage, but then you take a dollar or a
[51:46.110 --> 51:50.110]  portion of whatever they get paid to make your business work. So that happens around here.
[51:50.990 --> 51:56.350]  Like I said, there'll be a need for lodging, hotels. Hotels will be serious when cannabis
[51:56.350 --> 52:00.910]  goes recreational in your area because people will be coming from afar to the nearest dispensaries to
[52:00.910 --> 52:06.750]  get cannabis. We get people, we're in Colorado, we get people from Texas, Wyoming, Oklahoma.
[52:06.750 --> 52:10.910]  They come from all over to get weed from us here and they're filling up the hotels. They'll come
[52:10.910 --> 52:15.230]  take weekend trips just to buy weed all over and they'll have to stay in a hotel somewhere.
[52:16.190 --> 52:20.190]  Let's see. So that's a lot of things that you guys could... Those are business opportunities
[52:20.190 --> 52:24.910]  that you could take advantage of. If you could open somewhere to actually consume cannabis in
[52:24.910 --> 52:29.790]  your area, that would be ideal because here you can buy weed at 13 different places within 10
[52:29.790 --> 52:35.230]  miles of each other, but there's nowhere to legally consume your cannabis. All right.
[52:35.230 --> 52:41.230]  So that's a big ass list of ancillary and niche businesses that you could participate in without
[52:41.230 --> 52:45.470]  opening up your own cannabis, but you could still capitalize on this cannabis industry.
[52:45.470 --> 52:50.270]  Also, there's those little hippie stores that sell hippie clothing, like patchwork pants and
[52:50.270 --> 52:55.070]  tie-dyed t-shirts and fucking hemp jewelry and all that kind of shit. I think if you open one
[52:55.070 --> 52:59.390]  of those near a dispensary and you capitalize on that cannabis theme, and like I said earlier,
[52:59.390 --> 53:05.230]  if you use your state or your city and weed out your slogan, like my logo for Iree Genetics is
[53:05.230 --> 53:09.870]  the Colorado flag that's turned into the Rasta colors. And people don't even know about the
[53:09.870 --> 53:14.510]  company when they see it and they're like, holy shit, I love that shirt. So that would be a good
[53:14.510 --> 53:20.350]  way to take your state flag or your city logo or whatever and turn it into some sort of cannabis
[53:20.350 --> 53:26.110]  theme to flag and make a spoof of it and sell that in your store in your area. That would sell,
[53:26.110 --> 53:29.790]  that would crush. But all right, I've gone on a long time about this subject. I'm going to take
[53:29.790 --> 53:34.750]  a drink of root beer and then we're going to... Actually, check it out. We have been on Periscope
[53:34.750 --> 53:37.870]  the entire time I've been recording and I told those people on Periscope that we would take
[53:37.870 --> 53:43.230]  questions. I see that we have 17 people on Periscope right now. I'd like to go about nine
[53:43.230 --> 53:47.390]  or eight more minutes in this podcast. So if Periscope has got any questions for me,
[53:47.390 --> 53:52.590]  please type in your questions while I take a drink and I will read my favorite questions and
[53:52.590 --> 53:56.270]  then I'll try to answer them the best that I can for you. So while I take a drink, you guys start
[53:56.270 --> 54:09.430]  typing your questions there on Periscope for me. All right, that's funny because usually Periscope
[54:09.430 --> 54:13.350]  is filled with questions and now they seem like they're stumped. Earlier on Periscope, somebody
[54:13.350 --> 54:20.230]  asked me, what is the difference between wax and shatter? So basically I am not the hash maker
[54:20.230 --> 54:24.870]  here. This is my experience from watching and hearing my hash maker friends talk. The difference
[54:24.870 --> 54:31.910]  between wax and shatter. Most BHO... Okay, somebody asked me a question there and I'm going to write
[54:31.910 --> 54:36.310]  it. I'm writing it down. How do you feel about smoking and driving? We're going to ask that
[54:36.310 --> 54:41.910]  and we're going to answer that in a second. I'm writing it down, smoke and drive. All right.
[54:41.910 --> 54:46.790]  But I was answering the first question. What's the difference between wax and shatter? Basically
[54:46.790 --> 54:51.910]  when you make BHO, if it's done right, they'll both come out very near... When it's done right,
[54:51.910 --> 54:56.550]  it'll come out very near shatter. The consistency will be very near shatter if not sappy.
[54:57.350 --> 55:01.590]  So at this point, if you vacuum purge it properly and don't mess with it too much,
[55:01.590 --> 55:07.430]  it will stay shatter. It will come out... Shatter is more like... Sorry, I'm burping after my drink.
[55:07.430 --> 55:11.350]  Shatter is like a Jolly Rancher consistency where it's kind of snappy. It'll break.
[55:11.350 --> 55:15.510]  That's why we call it shatter. It's like a little piece of glass. If you chip at it too hard,
[55:15.510 --> 55:22.310]  it'll shatter. So most hash, most BHO ran properly will turn into shatter. Now, the way that you make
[55:22.310 --> 55:30.470]  it into wax is right before it cools. How tight's the open container law? I don't know. Somebody
[55:30.470 --> 55:34.230]  asked me a question on Periscope that said, how tight's the open container laws? I'm not
[55:34.230 --> 55:38.150]  experienced with that. In my area, they don't give a shit, but in some areas they really do.
[55:38.150 --> 55:42.870]  So let me continue with my shatter versus wax part. So now we've got this shatter, right? It's
[55:42.870 --> 55:50.310]  hard. It's stable. Now you could turn that into wax by heating it or before you even let it warm,
[55:50.310 --> 55:54.310]  just keep it warm, before you let it cool, keep it warm. And what you do is whip it.
[55:54.310 --> 55:59.430]  And I don't know what they use to whip it. I've seen a few things like... I saw one guy use a
[55:59.430 --> 56:05.110]  metal pick for your Afro because it had four or five little fingers coming off of it. I guess
[56:05.110 --> 56:10.070]  they're teeth if they're on the pick, but he would put that in the Pyrex dish of hash and just
[56:10.070 --> 56:16.070]  stir it around really rapidly. And what he was trying to do is whip it like he was stirring some
[56:16.070 --> 56:20.470]  kind of food and trying to put air into it and make it fluffy. And so what that does is it
[56:20.470 --> 56:25.030]  fluffs it up. And then when it dries, there's air trapped in there and it just dries up a little bit
[56:25.030 --> 56:29.670]  differently. I don't know the science behind why, but it makes it waxy and it's a little bit easier
[56:29.670 --> 56:36.390]  to handle. Then they put that in the vac oven, just like they do the shatter and they clean it
[56:36.390 --> 56:40.870]  up. So I know that's not the most technical answer, but the main difference between wax and shatter
[56:40.870 --> 56:45.670]  is the whipping action that happens right before it's finished. You just whip it up and put a
[56:45.670 --> 56:51.270]  little bit of air in it and it makes a little bit fluffy. Somebody on Periscope says, keep the vac
[56:51.270 --> 56:56.710]  at 120 and it will bubble. Yeah, but 120 is a little high. That's when you start burning off
[56:56.710 --> 57:01.990]  turps is about 106, 110-ish. All right. So somebody asked me how I feel about smoking and
[57:01.990 --> 57:08.470]  driving. It's a really good question. I cannot advocate you smoking cannabis and driving.
[57:09.110 --> 57:13.750]  I can't say to do that, but again, I can't be a hypocrite because I do it myself occasionally.
[57:14.550 --> 57:19.190]  How I feel about it is if you know your limits and you're not going to be a dipshit out there
[57:19.190 --> 57:25.590]  on the road and you're not fucked up, drive if you've had a little bit to smoke. But if you're
[57:25.590 --> 57:29.830]  the kind of person that smokes and goes fucking full retarded, don't get behind the wheel.
[57:29.830 --> 57:35.190]  Know your limitations. Check yourself before you hurt somebody or yourself. That's how I really
[57:35.190 --> 57:39.590]  feel about it. I would be a hypocrite if I came on here and I said, don't take dabs and drive.
[57:40.390 --> 57:45.990]  Maybe don't take dabs and drive simultaneously. Try not to smoke in the car. Just don't be that
[57:45.990 --> 57:51.430]  asshole. Think about the news article about you when you fuck up in the future. Check out what
[57:51.430 --> 57:56.710]  you're doing and say, I'm about to be a news story. You know what I mean? If I crash into
[57:56.710 --> 58:01.190]  somebody right now while I'm smoking this bong in the car, I'm going to be on the news. I'm going to
[58:01.190 --> 58:05.030]  look like an asshole. I'm going to be a black eye for the cannabis community. Or I don't want to get
[58:05.030 --> 58:10.150]  pulled over while I'm taking this dab. Think about that kind of shit. But if you want to get blazed
[58:10.150 --> 58:15.110]  before you drive and you can handle it and you're not an idiot, that's your thing. Do that. Don't
[58:15.110 --> 58:19.590]  drink a drop of alcohol and drive because I'm a hypocrite maybe, but I feel alcohol really fucks
[58:19.590 --> 58:24.150]  with your equilibrium, your balance, your depth of perception. It really fucks you up. But if
[58:24.150 --> 58:30.150]  you're a medical marijuana consumer, you've got a tolerance, you're experienced, and you're not
[58:30.150 --> 58:35.270]  smoking it just to get retarded high. If you're smoking just to get retarded high, don't drive.
[58:35.270 --> 58:39.510]  Chill out for a little bit. Let somebody drive for you. Call an Uber. Do whatever you got to do.
[58:39.510 --> 58:43.670]  That's my opinion on that. All right, Periscope, you have one more question for me? It'd be perfect
[58:43.670 --> 58:47.990]  to get one more question in. And on Periscope, they're sending me a bunch of hearts, which means
[58:47.990 --> 58:53.510]  they got love for me. Is it technically illegal to drive high? Yes, it is technically illegal to
[58:53.510 --> 58:58.150]  drive high. That's driving under the influence of drugs or driving with ability impaired,
[58:58.150 --> 59:01.510]  depending on how they book you or how they write it down or whatever. I don't know what the
[59:01.510 --> 59:06.790]  difference would be, but it is absolutely illegal to drive while you're high. And it's definitely
[59:06.790 --> 59:15.270]  looked down upon. DUI, somebody on Periscope says DUI, it's driving under the influence. So yeah,
[59:15.590 --> 59:19.590]  don't be high when you're driving. And if the cops ask you how long ago you smoked,
[59:19.590 --> 59:24.870]  say six hours ago, be like, it's been at least six hours ago. But if you're smoking a joint in
[59:24.870 --> 59:29.910]  the car, if you got a blunt burn in, that's no excuse. All right, I'm waiting for Periscope
[59:29.910 --> 59:33.270]  to throw up one more question. If they don't throw up one more question, we will start closing up the
[59:33.270 --> 59:40.470]  show. What's my favorite part of my job? Oh, open container. So favorite part of my job in open
[59:40.470 --> 59:43.590]  container. I'm going to write down the open container. That's funny because I wrote down
[59:43.590 --> 59:48.070]  open content. That looks terrible. I want to be in the cannabis industry. How do I get involved
[59:48.070 --> 59:52.870]  in the biz? I'm going to write that down. And now guys, slow down with the questions because I've
[59:52.870 --> 59:58.390]  got fucking one that I wrote down and one that I forgot. Remind me the one favorite part, favorite
[59:58.390 --> 01:00:06.230]  part. I'm writing all this shit down guys, because I got to go fast. How do I work in MJ? All right,
[01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:09.510]  I got three questions. I'm going to answer these. So if you throw up more questions, I'm sorry,
[01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:13.510]  I probably won't get to them unless it's a really good question. So here we go. What's my favorite
[01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:21.510]  part of my job? My job is to provide the best quality cannabis that I can for the customers at
[01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:27.270]  the spot dispensary. My other job is to provide the best quality cannabis that I can for the
[01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:33.030]  medical marijuana patients, which have designated me as their caregiver. The other part of my job
[01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:40.230]  is to host a podcast that teaches other people how to grow better cannabis to improve the quality of
[01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:46.150]  their own lives. Another big part of my job that people don't realize is I'm a father. So I am
[01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:52.470]  shaping somebody. I'm creating another person into what I hope to be a successful and happy human
[01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:59.430]  being. So the favorite part of my job is helping other people out and seeing the positive effect
[01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:07.830]  that the work I do has on other people's lives. Because honestly, I grow weed and I'm a dad
[01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:13.190]  and play on Instagram and I play on Periscope and it feels like I'm just playing. I'm a big
[01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:18.070]  man child because my job is what I love. So it doesn't feel like I'm working. And that right
[01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:22.390]  there may be my favorite part of it. It doesn't feel like I'm working ever. I'll be completely
[01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:29.990]  sweaty. That's a good question, but I'm probably not going to get to that one. Text that to me
[01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:36.390]  on Twitter and I'll answer that. And yes, I do play the drums. So I do a lot of things. And I
[01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:41.430]  my favorite part of my job is seeing people happy. I've got a patient named Doug. He's a 60 year old
[01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:46.150]  guy and he feels like shit half the time. And I grow cannabis that I know he loves. And I go to
[01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:49.910]  his house and I roll up a big fat joint or I give him a dab and I'm like, hey, Doug, let's hang out
[01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:54.950]  and smoke this. And when I get there, he's hurt or sick and depressed. And he's got a shitty look
[01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:58.790]  on his face. And by the time I leave, the dude's got a smile on his face and he loves the world
[01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:03.830]  and he loves life again. And part of that is my interaction with the guy. But a large portion of
[01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:09.110]  that is the cannabis plant and a large portion of that is the cannabis that I grew from my heart
[01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:14.230]  and gave to this old guy to feel better. So that's probably the favorite part of my job is that I'm
[01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:18.630]  healing people. Even the people that are smoking cannabis recreationally, it's healing. It feels
[01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:24.630]  better to take a fat puff of ganja and blow out that smoke and just feel better. So I get to do
[01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:29.430]  that to people every day. I get to see that. It is all in the love. That's absolutely correct.
[01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:33.590]  Somebody asked me what's my favorite part. I think that is it. I get to see people
[01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:37.510]  improve their lives from my work and that makes me feel fucking golden inside.
[01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:44.070]  Somebody asked me about an open container law. Here in Colorado, we've started treating cannabis
[01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:50.150]  like alcohol is our new model here. So we've got what's called the open container law. Unfortunately,
[01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:55.190]  I am not up to date on the open container law. I don't know enough about it. In my city,
[01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:59.830]  you can drive around with your dab rig on the dash. My city is a little bit gangster and nobody
[01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:02.790]  cares what you're doing here as long as you're not shooting at each other when you drive by.
[01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:08.630]  In other places, you've got to have your stuff in a childproof container or a sealed container
[01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:11.990]  in your vehicle and it's got to be out of your reach and in the trunk, I think.
[01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:18.390]  But my vehicle doesn't have a trunk. So I put it in my backpack and then I put it in the backseat.
[01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:23.670]  But quite often, honestly, there's a dab rig in my center console. But if I'm driving from here
[01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:27.910]  to Rave's house, what am I going to do? I just put the dab rig in the center console. I put my
[01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:31.750]  hash, my carb cap, my torch in there and I drive over to Rave's and I carry it into the house and
[01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:37.990]  I take a couple dabs. So honestly, I don't know enough about that open container law to be useful.
[01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:44.550]  And I'm not a lawyer, so don't follow my advice on that shit at all. Somebody asked, how do I
[01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:51.270]  get to work in the marijuana industry? You have to start by applying for your... If you're coming
[01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:56.150]  to Colorado, you have to start by applying for your marijuana enforcement division badge.
[01:03:56.150 --> 01:04:00.310]  You have to go to the website. I'm not sure which website it is. I didn't have time to research, but
[01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:04.790]  if you search it, how do I find my marijuana enforcement badge for Colorado?
[01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:10.230]  You'll find the website. There will be a list of instructions. Fill out the application. You'll
[01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:13.830]  have to come to Colorado. You'll have to be fingerprinted and then they'll let you know if
[01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:18.950]  you pass that background check or not. How much is the badge? There are two levels of badges.
[01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:25.750]  One is $150 and one is $300. And you have to take a check. They do not accept cash.
[01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:29.670]  So you have to make an appointment, download the application, fill out the application,
[01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:34.630]  make an appointment to go, get a check. Or no, it's a money order. Get a check or a money order.
[01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:38.150]  I think it's a money order. You need a money order. So get yourself a money order,
[01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:43.190]  go to the appointment. They will... That's a lot of questions. Somebody just asked me,
[01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:47.350]  what's allowed to be on your background? Basically, no drug felonies. If you have got
[01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:52.630]  college loans and shit, you got to start... You have to be in good standing with all of
[01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:57.190]  your college loans. Your child support has to be up to date. You have to be pretty legit.
[01:04:57.190 --> 01:05:01.030]  If you're fucking around, they're going to want to know why you're fucking around. They're going
[01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:07.910]  to ask you questions. So get the application filled out, get yourself a badge. Then the thing
[01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:14.390]  to do is hit every dispensary you can with a resume and explain to them why you're the employee that
[01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:18.390]  they want. And if you're not experienced in the cannabis industry here in Colorado, it's going
[01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:24.230]  to be difficult getting your foot in the door because the dispensaries are full. People have
[01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:29.750]  been employed there for quite a while. I don't know if you can get into the cannabis industry
[01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:35.190]  with marijuana misdemeanors. I really do not know the... I don't know. Sorry, I apologize. I don't
[01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:38.070]  have that right on hand. If I would have prepared that question, I would have researched it for you.
[01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:42.870]  But since we're doing it right off the cuff here, I'm not sure. But so you get your badge and then
[01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:46.230]  you come here and then you apply. And then hopefully you get somebody's attention. And
[01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:51.350]  you're probably going to have to start by being a trimmer or a bud tender or something like that.
[01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:57.510]  So I would learn how to trim weed is probably where you're going to start because unless you're
[01:05:57.510 --> 01:06:01.590]  a master grower and you can prove it, nobody's going to let you start off being a master grower.
[01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:06.310]  It's not going to happen. You're going to be an hourly trimmer. So work on your resume,
[01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:11.910]  start learning how to trim weed, learn how to be chipper, grow some boobs. I hate to say it,
[01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:17.990]  but dispensaries will hire you if you have got some boobs. If you're a cute 22, 25-year-old chick
[01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:21.430]  and you can flirt with the customers and you can sell them some shit, there's a good chance you're
[01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:26.470]  going to get a job in the cannabis industry. All right. So that's enough of my Periscope
[01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:30.150]  questions for today, you guys. Thank you so much on Periscope for asking questions and
[01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:34.070]  participating in the show. You guys that aren't on Periscope that are just listening on iTunes
[01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:38.150]  or Stitcher or the website, thank you for listening. If you want to find me on Periscope,
[01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:42.070]  it's at rostageff420. I would appreciate you checking out my Periscope videos. I do about
[01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:45.270]  one Periscope, maybe two videos every day. I take some dabs and hang out.
[01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:51.190]  Somebody said, let me trim for you while you teach me. I'll show you on a video one day. We'll do
[01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:55.350]  some Periscope and trim on the video. I trim on Periscope quite often. But you guys that are
[01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:58.230]  listening, if you want to check it out, it would be really fun to see you on there. You can ask
[01:06:58.230 --> 01:07:02.790]  questions. I will start scheduling podcasts. It's hard for me to schedule when I'm going to record
[01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:06.150]  because I don't know when I'm going to get home and how my life is going to go. But if I just pick
[01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:10.470]  a time, it will happen. Somebody just said, thanks for all of my hard work. I appreciate that. Oh,
[01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:13.590]  it's El Diablo. Man, you're very welcome. Everyone's very welcome for all the hard work
[01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:17.990]  that I put in for the podcast. I appreciate getting feedback from it. I'm going to go ahead
[01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:22.950]  and wrap up the show. Looks like I've got a news article for next week, which is always cool. I'll
[01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:28.470]  probably be back on Thursday with another episode. You guys, thanks for listening. Everybody on

[01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:19.330]  4th of July weekend. I hope you had a bunch of good fun. Hope you had a safe weekend. Hope nobody

[01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:30.130]  went wrong. I hope everything went well for you. All right. So on the 5th of July, I'm going to
[01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:34.130]  brag a little bit. I got to see who else? Who would you guess? Right? You know me. I got to
[01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:38.690]  see Mr. Doug Benson at Comedy Works in Denver. Doug was in town. He did another standup comedy
[01:15:38.690 --> 01:15:44.610]  show. And I got to tell you, he really redeemed himself from the last show that I saw. If you
[01:15:44.610 --> 01:15:49.970]  listen to this podcast regularly, you know that I kind of bashed Doug Benson's last performance
[01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:56.290]  at Comedy Works. And I also kind of bashed his album. He did a much better performance this time.
[01:15:56.290 --> 01:16:00.770]  He had a little bit of a cough, which may have worked to our advantage. Doug wasn't smoking as
[01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:05.330]  heavily because he was a little bit under the weather. And I think it led to him having a better
[01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:12.930]  performance. Doug did make a comment. Actually, Doug walked out on stage, and the first thing Doug
[01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:18.290]  said was, hey, you know it's a Doug Benson show because Rasta Jeff is here. And of course, I was
[01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:22.690]  sitting right in the front row. I've got those two VIP seats always. So that was kind of neat.
[01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:27.250]  But then he started talking a little bit, and he pulled out a handful of notes. And he said, well,
[01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:31.650]  I got my jokes here in my pocket. And he looked me straight in the face, and he said, Rasta Jeff
[01:16:31.650 --> 01:16:37.570]  knows what I'm talking about. If you guys listen to this podcast, I called Doug out on his pocket
[01:16:37.650 --> 01:16:43.330]  full of disheveled notes on another episode. I am wondering if Doug listens to the podcast.
[01:16:44.130 --> 01:16:48.450]  I'm not sure. But Doug, if you're listening, dude, great show. Thanks for a great time.
[01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:51.570]  I hope you're getting over that cough. And I've been watching your Periscope videos,
[01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:56.930]  and they're great. Also at Comedy Works that weekend, or the same day, opening for Doug
[01:16:56.930 --> 01:17:01.410]  Benson was my friend N'Gayo B'Lem. If you don't know N'Gayo B'Lem, make sure you check him out.
[01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:07.890]  His name is spelled N-G-A-I-O. It's at N'Gayo420 on Twitter. Make sure you search him out and
[01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:12.530]  follow him. He's a really good dude. Had a lot of fun. He's a cannabis connoisseur like myself.
[01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:18.130]  So we have a lot of things to talk about. And we may hint at a future collaboration between the
[01:17:18.130 --> 01:17:21.570]  two of us. We'll talk too much about it, but there may be some stuff being talked about.
[01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:25.170]  He does live in California. I live in Colorado. There are a lot of things to deal with there.
[01:17:25.650 --> 01:17:28.530]  But we are going to try and do some shit together.
[01:17:29.890 --> 01:17:36.690]  I got to say N'Gayo crushed. N'Gayo did probably 20 minutes, maybe 30. It seemed like he went on
[01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:40.450]  for a long time, but he definitely tore it up. Had to be 15 or 20 minutes because I'm sure he
[01:17:40.450 --> 01:17:46.050]  didn't do more than that being an opening act. But he was on fire. He made me laugh my ass off.
[01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:51.170]  Doug Benson was equally hilarious, but I've seen Doug so many times that when he starts
[01:17:51.970 --> 01:17:55.890]  a into a vibe, I know which jokes are coming out of this clump of,
[01:17:57.250 --> 01:18:00.770]  like this part of the show is going to be this clump of jokes. And then the vibe will change
[01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:04.530]  because he's very interactive with the crowd. He does a lot of crowd work, but I know all of
[01:18:04.530 --> 01:18:10.290]  Doug's jokes. So it's a little predictable for me. I go for the fun. I go for the smoke session
[01:18:10.290 --> 01:18:14.690]  before and after, of course, because that's always a good time. So enough bragging about my weekend at
[01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:19.010]  Comedy Works. I owe a big shout out to Mr. Doug Benson, of course, a big shout out to N'Gayo
[01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:24.850]  B'Lum, a big, huge shout out to Comedy Works, the greatest comedy venue on the planet. Also a big
[01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:29.650]  shout out to my buddy Baker. He always gets me the hookups at Comedy Works. He takes good care of me.
[01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:34.450]  Bro, big thanks. And also a big shout out to my beautiful date, Danielle. Thanks for being a
[01:18:34.450 --> 01:18:38.130]  wonderful date. You're not a pain in the ass. You're really easy to deal with. I had a lot of
[01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:44.050]  fun. I look forward to going to more comedy shows with you. All right. I might sneeze here in a
[01:18:44.050 --> 01:18:48.770]  minute, but we're just going to push on through until that happens. So I want to get into a little
[01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:54.610]  bit of news. I was, I woke up the other day and I got on the internet here and I see my buddy
[01:18:54.610 --> 01:18:59.810]  Giddyup's face plastered all over the damn place. I want to give a huge shout out to Giddyup and Too
[01:18:59.810 --> 01:19:04.930]  Short. We've been, if you guys follow the show, you've been hearing about the raid that happened
[01:19:04.930 --> 01:19:10.530]  in Santa Ana, California. The manager of that dispensary was in a wheelchair and she was blind
[01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:16.770]  and she has an amputated leg. She has been getting a lot of media coverage and recently it was
[01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:21.090]  discovered that her wheelchair was, her electric wheelchair was kind of falling apart and it was
[01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:27.890]  held together mainly by duct tape. Well, there were a couple of people that thought that a lady
[01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:34.930]  in her position deserved better than a duct tape wheelchair. So Giddyup from Emotech and Too Short
[01:19:34.930 --> 01:19:40.530]  got together and bought this lovely lady a brand new wheelchair. So I want to give a big, huge,
[01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:46.450]  personal shout out to Giddyup and to Too Short. That represents two industries that are always
[01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:50.450]  looked down upon. The rap industry has always looked at like a bunch of gangsters and the
[01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:55.090]  cannabis industry has looked at like a bunch of drug dealers, but look what two of our representatives
[01:19:55.090 --> 01:20:01.250]  did. From what I read, that wheelchair was about $4,000. That's not pocket change for anybody. So
[01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:06.850]  that's a good deed done by our industry and big shout out to Giddyup. Much respect to Giddyup. I
[01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:12.450]  truly appreciate you. That's really cool. Giddy actually sent me my g-nail that I use and there's
[01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:17.170]  nothing like it. So do whatever you can to support Emotech. Send them a thank you, something like
[01:20:17.170 --> 01:20:21.650]  that. All right, I've got another news article on the screen. I've got to decide which one I want
[01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:29.570]  to read first. They're both, let's see, let's go to this one here. This one, I was just browsing
[01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:33.330]  through news sites and I came across this and I thought that the world would like to hear about
[01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:39.970]  this. The headline says, do medical marijuana users have right to bear arms? No, says the ATF.
[01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:44.610]  And then it says there are no exceptions in federal law for marijuana purportedly used for
[01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:50.050]  medicinal purposes, ATF officials says. This article is by Matt Voltz and it's from the
[01:20:50.050 --> 01:20:56.610]  Associated Press. And it goes like this, it's from Helena, Montana. It says firearms dealers
[01:20:56.610 --> 01:21:01.570]  in states that allow medical marijuana can't sell guns or ammunition to registered users of the drug,
[01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:07.330]  a policy that marijuana and gun rights groups say deny second amendment rights to individuals who
[01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:12.050]  are following state law. Federal law already makes it illegal for someone to possess a gun
[01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:17.730]  if he or she is an unlawful user of or addicted to marijuana or other controlled substances.
[01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:23.090]  A September 21st letter from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives
[01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:28.610]  issued in response to numerous inquiries from gun dealers clarifies that medical marijuana
[01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:34.130]  patients are included in that definition. There are no exceptions in federal law for marijuana
[01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:40.050]  purportedly used for medicinal purposes, even if such use is sanctioned by state law,
[01:21:40.050 --> 01:21:44.290]  said the letter by Arthur Herber, the ATF's assistant director for enforcement programs
[01:21:44.290 --> 01:21:51.490]  and services. Federal firearms licensees or FFLs can't sell a gun to someone who answers yes
[01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:55.970]  when requested forms asked whether the buyer is a controlled substance user.
[01:21:57.490 --> 01:22:02.370]  So that's kind of a tricky, that's bullshit right there. All right, I'm gonna keep reading on.
[01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:06.770]  Reasonable cause to believe. This week's letter also says that license dealers can't sell a gun
[01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:11.730]  or ammunition if they have reasonable cause to believe the buyer is using a controlled substance.
[01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:15.890]  That includes if the buyer presents a medical marijuana card as identification or if the
[01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:20.450]  buyer talks about drug use, having a medical marijuana card or a recent drug conviction,
[01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:27.090]  ATF spokesman Drew Wade said Wednesday. But there are no new obligations for gun dealers outlined
[01:22:27.090 --> 01:22:31.250]  in the letter, Wade said. We received lots of queries from the industry from various states
[01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:35.890]  of how to deal with the state legislation and federal law, he said, is our responsibility to
[01:22:35.890 --> 01:22:42.050]  provide guidance, advice and guidance. The clash between state and federal laws has led to lawsuits
[01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:46.530]  and criminal cases in some of the 16 states that have legalized medical marijuana use.
[01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:50.930]  Officials in two Oregon counties have said they'll appeal the US Supreme Court after state
[01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:55.890]  judges said sheriffs couldn't deny concealed handgun licenses for medical marijuana patients.
[01:22:55.890 --> 01:23:00.130]  The Oregon Court of Appeals and the Oregon Supreme Court said the state law authorizes
[01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:04.530]  concealed handgun permits and separate from the federal law that outlaws gun possession
[01:23:04.530 --> 01:23:10.690]  by drug users and the state gun law doesn't address medical marijuana use. Sorry, I'm reading
[01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:16.530]  ahead of myself here. The Montana raids, federal authorities also raided dozens of medical marijuana
[01:23:16.530 --> 01:23:22.130]  operations across Montana this spring, chilling a once booming pot industry and leading to sweeping
[01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:27.010]  changes in Montana laws. The Department of Justice followed up with a warning letter to political
[01:23:27.010 --> 01:23:31.890]  leaders in many states that federal prosecutors will pursue marijuana distributors, but not
[01:23:31.890 --> 01:23:37.250]  individual patients who are following state law. The letter the ATF sent to gun dealers last week
[01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:42.210]  was first reported by Lee newspapers of Montana, Pearl Marijuana and Gun Group said the policy
[01:23:42.210 --> 01:23:47.250]  clarification amounts to rescinding the gun rights for the thousands of people licensed to use
[01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:53.170]  medical marijuana laws. And it appears to contradict the 2009 Department of Justice memo that said
[01:23:53.170 --> 01:23:58.450]  Obama administration would not pursue prosecution of individual medical marijuana users who will
[01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:03.650]  base state laws. Beside that the government is putting an additional burden on gun dealers to
[01:24:03.650 --> 01:24:09.970]  police their customers. He said Montana said Montana Shooting Sports Association, Gary Marba.
[01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:15.410]  Their business is to be merchants not to be cops. Unfortunately, the federal licensing scheme
[01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:22.130]  complicates that Marba said it sounds as if the ATF is expecting them to drift further into that cop
[01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:26.850]  role. It could you imagine that you guys now that if you're a gun seller, you don't have to just
[01:24:26.850 --> 01:24:30.610]  follow that paper. You actually have to like talk to everybody and try to act like you're the cops
[01:24:30.610 --> 01:24:35.410]  also. And then there are going to be a bunch of vigilantes. They're going to see somebody like I
[01:24:35.410 --> 01:24:40.850]  bet if I went into a gun store, they would deny me a sale. Even if I never figured out this question
[01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:45.410]  or filled out this questionnaire, they'd say you're a pothead, you cannot buy a gun. And that is now up
[01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:52.290]  to vaguely up to the store owner or the salesperson, which is kind of ridiculous. I'll
[01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:58.450]  keep reading the article here. Protecting America from criminals. Wade said both the 2009 memo and
[01:24:58.450 --> 01:25:01.810]  last week's letter were approved by the Justice Department and he does not believe there is a
[01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:08.610]  contradiction in the two messages. He also he also that the dealers are in good position to help
[01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:12.850]  prevent firearms from getting into the wrong hands. They must have omitted a word I'm going to
[01:25:12.850 --> 01:25:16.610]  say he also said that the dealers are in a good position to help prevent firearms from getting
[01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:22.370]  into the wrong hands. That makes more sense. The FFLs aren't cops. They are at the front line of
[01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:27.170]  protecting America from criminals or people who are prohibited prohibited from possessing firearms.
[01:25:27.170 --> 01:25:33.170]  Wade said a salesman at once licensed firearms dealer Montana outdoor sports and Helena said he
[01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:38.130]  doesn't expect much to change as a result of the letter because it's largely up to the buyer to
[01:25:38.210 --> 01:25:43.410]  reveal whether he or she is a medical marijuana user who's going to say yes to that as Damon
[01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:48.770]  Peters, a sales associate for the store and a licensed hunting guide. A lot of use a lot of
[01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:53.410]  users of medical marijuana aren't really shooting sports enthusiasts anyway. I think we may see a
[01:25:53.410 --> 01:26:01.330]  sailor to lost but I don't see anything dramatic that's going to affect us he said. So there's a
[01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:08.210]  lot of talk about guns going on in our country later lately. And I I support guns. I mean,
[01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:11.810]  if they took away all the guns, the only people that would have guns would be the bad guys,
[01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:15.250]  right? That's kind of the way that works, right? If the guns were illegal, you know, like the
[01:26:15.250 --> 01:26:17.970]  criminals aren't going to care that the guns are illegal. They're not going to be like, Oh, here's
[01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:23.970]  my guns. That's just gonna that's bullshit of a theory, I think. So now what's happening is if
[01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:30.690]  you're a medical marijuana patient, you are not allowed to purchase a firearm. What kind of shit
[01:26:30.690 --> 01:26:37.170]  is that? Just because so here's another side of this. I can be a Vicodin patient, I can be
[01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:45.410]  a Valium patient, I can be maybe some sort of antidepressant user, patient, whatever you call
[01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:51.410]  the person that's taking that. And then I'm able to buy a gun, I can take my Vicodin, my Ritalin,
[01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:57.090]  my Valium, my Ambien. And what else could I take possibly to go with this, my Celebrex and my
[01:26:57.090 --> 01:27:01.970]  Vicodin and then a boner pill because everybody's got to have a boner pill, right? I could take all
[01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:06.850]  of those and then I could go buy a gun but I can't use my medical cannabis to ease my pain a little
[01:27:06.850 --> 01:27:15.010]  bit or help my appetite and then purchase a firearm to either protect my home or hunt for food or just
[01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:19.810]  have it because I'm a good old American and I should have a damn gun. This is kind of a ridiculous
[01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:24.450]  law. I thought that everybody should be made aware of this. I don't know what we can do about it. But
[01:27:24.610 --> 01:27:31.090]  I thought it was very interesting. They are kind of right though about the people that smoke medical
[01:27:31.090 --> 01:27:35.330]  cannabis not wanting to be hunters and shooters. But this is Colorado and you'd be surprised the
[01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:40.770]  diversity of people here. I've got friends who have dreadlocks, who snowboard on the one weekend
[01:27:40.770 --> 01:27:45.970]  and who will go elk hunting the next weekend. They may be wrong with their assumptions on who
[01:27:45.970 --> 01:27:50.690]  is hunting and who is using cannabis. That may be bullshit. There's so much in this article that we
[01:27:50.690 --> 01:27:57.650]  could bitch about. But instead, let's move on to a little bit more of a positive note. This article
[01:27:57.650 --> 01:28:03.410]  comes from the Washington Post and it is written by a guy named Radley Balco and the headline is
[01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:10.290]  since marijuana legalization, highway fatalities in Colorado are at a near historic low. Yes.
[01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:15.810]  Let me read this article for you. It says, since Colorado voters legalized pot in 2012,
[01:28:15.810 --> 01:28:19.890]  prohibition supporters have warned that recreational marijuana will lead to a scourge
[01:28:19.890 --> 01:28:24.930]  of drugged drivers on the state's roads. They often point out that when the state legalized
[01:28:24.930 --> 01:28:30.610]  medical marijuana in 2001, there was a surge in drivers found to have smoked pot. They also point
[01:28:30.610 --> 01:28:35.330]  to studies showing that in other states, showing that in other states that have legalized pot for
[01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:40.370]  medicinal purposes, we've seen an increase in the number of drivers testing positive for the drug
[01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:45.490]  who were involved in fatal car accidents. The anti-pot group, Sam, recently pointed out that
[01:28:45.490 --> 01:28:49.890]  even before the first legal pot store opened in Washington state, the number of drivers in that
[01:28:49.890 --> 01:28:55.730]  state testing positive for pot jumped by a third. The problem with these criticisms is that we can
[01:28:55.730 --> 01:29:01.810]  test only for the presence of marijuana metabolites, not for inebriation. Metabolites can linger in the
[01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:08.610]  body for days after the drug's effects wear off, sometimes even for weeks. I'm going to chime in
[01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:15.650]  myself here. I'm a very heavy cannabis user. A long time ago, this had to be nearly 10 years ago,
[01:29:15.650 --> 01:29:19.730]  I was trying to get a good job that would have paid very well and had some great benefits.
[01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:26.290]  And so I quit smoking cannabis. All I had to do is pass one drug test. All this place did was one
[01:29:26.290 --> 01:29:29.410]  pre-hire screening, and then I would have been home free. I could have worked there forever,
[01:29:29.410 --> 01:29:33.650]  never had to pee test again unless I hurt myself, in which case I would have just walked away.
[01:29:33.810 --> 01:29:38.930]  So I went 30 days and I took a voluntary pee test that you can buy at the store,
[01:29:38.930 --> 01:29:44.930]  and I was still dirty. I went 45 days and took a pee test and I was still dirty. I went 60 days
[01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:49.650]  and I took a pee test and I was still dirty, but I already had my interview scheduled. So 63 days
[01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:54.370]  in, I went and took a pee test and the doctor called me back and told me that I still had
[01:29:54.930 --> 01:30:01.650]  more than 1400 nanograms per whatever their measurement was. I had more than that.
[01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:08.530]  I had more than their limit of THC in my urine after 63 days. And he asked me if I was taking
[01:30:08.530 --> 01:30:12.610]  prescription Marinol or what I was doing. And I told him that I hadn't smoked in nine weeks
[01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:17.410]  and he was a little bit blown away. So they're saying that metabolites can linger in the body
[01:30:17.410 --> 01:30:23.890]  for days, sometimes even weeks. I am a prime example. I went nine weeks and there was still
[01:30:23.890 --> 01:30:29.250]  cannabis in my system. Let me tell you that on day 64, I took a fat bong hit and I don't think
[01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:33.570]  I've ever been that fucking high in my life. All right. I'm going to continue on with the article
[01:30:33.570 --> 01:30:37.730]  here. It says because we all metabolize drugs differently and at different times and under
[01:30:37.730 --> 01:30:42.130]  different conditions, all that positive test tells us is that the driver has smoked pot at some point
[01:30:42.130 --> 01:30:46.530]  in the past few days or weeks. It makes sense that loosening restrictions on pot would result
[01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:50.610]  in higher, any higher percentage of drivers involved in fatal traffic accidents, having
[01:30:50.610 --> 01:30:55.890]  smoked the drug at some point over the past few days or weeks. You'd also expect to find that a
[01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:59.970]  higher percentage of church growers, good Samaritans and soup kitchen volunteers would
[01:30:59.970 --> 01:31:05.250]  have pot in their system. It expect a similar result among any large sampling of people.
[01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:10.290]  This doesn't necessarily mean that marijuana caused or was even a contributing factor to accidents,
[01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:15.890]  traffic violations, or fatalities. This isn't an argument that pot wasn't a factor in at least some
[01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:20.930]  of those accidents either, but that's precisely the point. A post-accident test for marijuana
[01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:26.050]  metabolites doesn't tell us much about whether pot contributed to the accident. Since the new
[01:31:26.050 --> 01:31:31.650]  Colorado law took effect in January, the drug driver panic has only intensified. I've already
[01:31:31.650 --> 01:31:36.770]  written about one dubious example in which the Colorado Highway Patrol and some local and had
[01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:41.890]  some local and national media perpetuated a story that a driver was high on pot when he slammed into
[01:31:41.890 --> 01:31:46.370]  a couple of police cars parked on an interstate exit ramp. While the driver did have some pot in
[01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:51.650]  his system, his blood alcohol level was off the charts and was far more likely the cause of the
[01:31:51.650 --> 01:31:56.130]  accident. And that's something that we've seen a few times here, that people will be on other drugs,
[01:31:56.130 --> 01:31:59.090]  they'll be drunk and they'll get in an accident and they'll have a little bit of cannabis in their
[01:31:59.090 --> 01:32:04.050]  system and they blame that shit on the cannabis. Like they overlook the fact that this guy was on
[01:32:04.050 --> 01:32:09.090]  four hits of acid, that he was tweaking his brains out, that he had mushrooms in his brain, but he
[01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:12.370]  smoked a little bit of weed. So that had to have been what sent him over the edge and made him
[01:32:12.370 --> 01:32:17.090]  crash his car. All right, we're going to go a little bit more here. Where the hell was I?
[01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:25.170]  All right. In my colleague, Mark Fisher's recent dispatch from Colorado law enforcement officials
[01:32:25.170 --> 01:32:30.290]  there and in bordering states warn that they're seeing more drug drivers. Congress recently held
[01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:34.530]  hearings on the matter, complete with dire predictions such as we're going to have a lot
[01:32:34.530 --> 01:32:40.450]  more people stoned on the highway and there will be consequences from rep John Micah of Florida.
[01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:45.650]  Some have called for a zero tolerance policy. If you're driving with any trace of upon your system,
[01:32:45.650 --> 01:32:50.930]  you're guilty of a DWI that would effectively ban anyone who smokes pot from driving up to a couple
[01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:56.450]  of weeks after the last joint, including people who legitimately use the drug for medical reasons.
[01:32:57.090 --> 01:33:01.570]  Guys, that means that I would never be able to drive again. That is basically what that shit
[01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:06.450]  says. That says that any medical cannabis user in Colorado would not be able to drive.
[01:33:07.410 --> 01:33:11.810]  And I guess now you can't drive or have a gun is the two articles that I've read today. This is
[01:33:11.810 --> 01:33:15.970]  getting a little crazy. Police state much with a question mark. All right, I'm going to read more
[01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:20.850]  of the article. Here we go. It seems to me that the best way to gauge the effect, gauge the effect
[01:33:20.850 --> 01:33:25.570]  legalization has had on the roadways is to look at what happened on the road since legalization
[01:33:25.570 --> 01:33:29.970]  took effect. Here's a month by month comparison of highway fatalities in Colorado through the
[01:33:29.970 --> 01:33:35.250]  first seven months of this year and last year. For a more thorough comparison, I've also included
[01:33:35.250 --> 01:33:41.330]  the highest fatality figures for each month since 2002, the lowest for each month since 2002,
[01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:45.970]  and the average for each month since 2002. And there is a graph here, you guys. I know graphs
[01:33:45.970 --> 01:33:50.850]  don't do you any good on the podcast, but we're going to look at this. The high since 2002,
[01:33:51.810 --> 01:33:57.410]  they are showing. All right, so there are one, two, three, four, five lines on this graph, right?
[01:33:58.210 --> 01:34:03.970]  And basically it is showing you that shit has gone down. Just take my word for it. So it says,
[01:34:03.970 --> 01:34:09.010]  as you can see, roadway fatalities this year are down from last year and down from the 13-year
[01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:13.730]  average. Of the seven months so far this year, five months saw a lower fatality figure than
[01:34:13.730 --> 01:34:19.330]  the last. Two months saw a slightly higher figure this year, and in one month, the two figures were
[01:34:19.330 --> 01:34:24.770]  equal. If we add up the total fatalities from January through July, it looks like this.
[01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:31.330]  And we're going to see, it's a downsloping graph, you guys. Just take my word for that. It is a
[01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:35.490]  downsloping. It starts high and it goes low. And then I'll read the rest of the article. It says,
[01:34:35.490 --> 01:34:40.290]  here, the high bar, and he says, pardon the pun, the high bar is what you get when you add the
[01:34:40.290 --> 01:34:46.370]  worst January since 2002 to the worst February, to the worst March, and so on. The low bar is the
[01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:52.290]  sum total of the safest January, February, et cetera, since 2002. What's notable here is that
[01:34:52.290 --> 01:35:00.290]  the total so far in 2014 are closer to the safest composite year since 2002 than to the average year
[01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:06.050]  since 2002. I should also add here that these are total fatalities. If I were to calculate these
[01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:12.050]  figures as a rate, say miles driven per fatality, the drop would be starker, both for this year
[01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:17.890]  and since Colorado legalized medical marijuana in 2001. While the number of miles Americans drive
[01:35:17.890 --> 01:35:22.930]  annually has leveled off nationally since the mid-2000s, the number of total miles traveled
[01:35:22.930 --> 01:35:28.690]  continues to go up in Colorado. If I were to measure by rate, then the state would be at lows
[01:35:28.690 --> 01:35:34.610]  unseen in decades. So we're driving even more is what he's saying, and we are crashing even less.
[01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:39.330]  The figures are similar in states that have legalized medical marijuana. While some studies
[01:35:39.330 --> 01:35:43.890]  have shown that the number of drivers involved in fatal collisions who test positive for marijuana
[01:35:43.890 --> 01:35:49.250]  had steadily increased as pot has become more available. Other studies have shown that overall
[01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:54.050]  traffic fatalities in those states have dropped. Again, because the pot tests only measure for
[01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:59.330]  recent pot use, not inebriation, there's nothing inconsistent about those results.
[01:36:00.370 --> 01:36:04.610]  Of course, the continuing drop in roadway fatalities in Colorado and elsewhere is due to
[01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:09.490]  a variety of factors such as better built cars and trucks, improved safety features, and better road
[01:36:09.490 --> 01:36:14.370]  engineering. These features in and of themselves only indicate that the roads are getting safer.
[01:36:14.370 --> 01:36:19.330]  They don't suggest that pot had anything to do with it. We're only seven months in. Maybe these
[01:36:19.330 --> 01:36:24.930]  figures will change. Finally, it's also possible that if it weren't for a legal pot, the 2014
[01:36:24.930 --> 01:36:30.050]  figures would be even lower. There's no real way to know that. We can only look at the data
[01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:34.530]  available. But you can bet that if fatalities were up this year, prohibition supporters would
[01:36:34.530 --> 01:36:39.730]  be blaming it on legal marijuana. Interestingly, though road fatalities have generally been
[01:36:39.730 --> 01:36:45.650]  falling in Colorado for a long time, 2013 actually saw a slight decrease from 2012.
[01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:51.170]  So fatalities are down the year after legalization after having gone up the year before.
[01:36:51.810 --> 01:36:57.730]  So that being said, some researchers have gone so far as to suggest that better access to pot
[01:36:57.730 --> 01:37:04.370]  is making the road safer, at least marginally. The theory is that people are substituting pot
[01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:10.530]  for alcohol and pot causes less driver impairment than booze. I need to see more studies before I'd
[01:37:10.530 --> 01:37:14.850]  be ready to endorse that theory. For example, there's also some research contradicting the
[01:37:14.850 --> 01:37:23.970]  theory that drinkers are ready to substitute pot for alcohol. I quit drinking completely when I got
[01:37:23.970 --> 01:37:28.530]  my medical marijuana card. I said to myself, I'm able to go to the store and buy cannabis now. I
[01:37:28.530 --> 01:37:33.010]  could buy all the herb I want. Because before you'd have to wait for your dude to have some,
[01:37:33.010 --> 01:37:36.450]  or you'd have to grow your own, or you'd have to wait for your crop to be ready, or you'd hope one
[01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:42.130]  of your bros had a joint. But when I got my medical marijuana card and I could just smoke down and
[01:37:42.130 --> 01:37:45.570]  then go to the store and buy some more, and then smoke down, and when I ran out, just go to the
[01:37:45.570 --> 01:37:51.650]  store tomorrow, I didn't even need to drink anymore. I quit drinking. I haven't had alcohol
[01:37:51.650 --> 01:37:56.530]  in so many years, and now I smoke all the cannabis I want. There's no need to drink when I can smoke
[01:37:56.530 --> 01:38:01.970]  herb. All right, I'll continue with the article. It says, but the data are far more supportive of
[01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:06.210]  that than the claims that stone drivers are menacing Colorado's roadways. And then he says,
[01:38:06.210 --> 01:38:09.890]  clarification, I wrote that we can test only for the presence of marijuana metabolites,
[01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:14.610]  not for inebriation. That isn't quite accurate. He does go on to say, this is true of roadside
[01:38:14.610 --> 01:38:18.850]  tests, but a blood test taken at a hospital can measure for THC, the psychoactive ingredient in
[01:38:18.850 --> 01:38:23.170]  marijuana. Oh, he said ingredient. We got to change that to compound. I'm crossing it out
[01:38:23.170 --> 01:38:28.050]  on the keyboard screen or on the computer screen, or writing compound. That being said, even here,
[01:38:28.050 --> 01:38:32.850]  there are problems. Regular users can still have remnant THC in their blood well after the effects
[01:38:32.850 --> 01:38:38.210]  have worn off. Regular users can also have levels above the legal limit and still drive perfectly
[01:38:38.210 --> 01:38:44.130]  well. He's talking about me. In Colorado, a THC level of five nanograms or more brings a presumptive
[01:38:44.130 --> 01:38:49.570]  charge of driving under the influence. However, references to marijuana related accidents and
[01:38:49.570 --> 01:38:54.210]  studies by prohibitionists and law enforcement could refer to any measure or trace of the drug.
[01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:59.330]  So when officials and legalization opponents talk about increases in these figures, it still isn't
[01:38:59.330 --> 01:39:04.930]  clear what any of this means for road safety. Because I need to take a quick drink, excuse me,
[01:39:04.930 --> 01:39:14.970]  for one minute, and then we will talk about this. All right, my throat is back in action. I was
[01:39:14.970 --> 01:39:22.250]  getting dry there. So since we have legalized cannabis, the traffic has been safer. When you
[01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:26.730]  get drunk, you drive recklessly. You don't give a shit. You want to go really, really fast. You're
[01:39:26.730 --> 01:39:30.250]  not paying attention. You're blacked out and you're just fucking driving and getting there.
[01:39:30.250 --> 01:39:33.930]  You don't care what lane you're in. You don't care what direction you're going. You probably
[01:39:33.930 --> 01:39:39.290]  don't even know where the hell you're trying to go. But when you're high, you're just calm.
[01:39:39.930 --> 01:39:45.050]  You look twice and you go a little bit under the speed limit because I don't want to go too fast.
[01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:49.530]  I'm high, man. You just want to cruise. You want to put the music at a comfortable level and you
[01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:54.330]  want to watch everything come at you at a decent pace. I never get too crazy when I'm driving high.
[01:39:55.370 --> 01:39:58.410]  I will admit that when I was a youngster, I would drive a little bit drunk.
[01:39:59.130 --> 01:40:04.250]  And that was some scary shit. I have never been scared of myself driving high, but I have scared
[01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:08.810]  the shit out of myself driving too drunk. It'll never happen again because I don't drink alcohol
[01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:12.330]  so I can talk about it freely. All right, you guys, let's see how far into this show we are.
[01:40:13.210 --> 01:40:17.050]  All right, we're already 27 minutes in. That last article took a little longer than I had
[01:40:17.050 --> 01:40:21.610]  anticipated. So why don't we go ahead and wrap up the show? You guys, I'm really trying to get
[01:40:21.610 --> 01:40:26.410]  Maddie and Spencer on. They have been a couple of busy suckers. They just had a big fat harvest.
[01:40:26.410 --> 01:40:30.890]  They just pulled their first round of seeds from their first breeding run. They're getting ready
[01:40:30.890 --> 01:40:36.730]  for the 7-10 party at the Lazy Lion this weekend. I'm trying to get them on. Hopefully they'll be
[01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:40.410]  available tomorrow. We can get them on the podcast. I've got a lot of cool stuff written
[01:40:40.410 --> 01:40:46.890]  down to talk to them about. Let's see. I will do another Periscope show really soon here. I like

[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:58.260]  get a better discount than what Jesse gets and he works at the shop. So go ahead and
[01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:01.700]  let them know that you are listening to the podcast and they will hook you up fat at Hydro
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:06.620]  Indoor Growing Supplies. It's 618 East 4th Street in beautiful Pueblo, Colorado. I was
[01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:10.820]  talking to Byrne yesterday, and if you're listening to this on Monday, they just got
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:16.140]  a fresh stock of worm castings from the Rocky Mountain Worm Company. So make sure you go
[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:20.220]  grab some worm castings today. All right, I think that's all the advertising I'm going
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:24.820]  to do today. If you're interested in sponsoring the show, just send me an email. It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:29.340]  I'll get you all of the information that you do need. You guys, I got a pretty solid show
[01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:33.180]  lined up for you. I hope everybody had a great 710. This is the Monday after the weekend
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:37.380]  of 710. I hope everybody had a great time at the Chalice Festival. I hope whatever you
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:40.500]  did for 710, you had a great time. I hope you coughed your lungs out. I hope you got
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:45.620]  dabbed the fuck out. Hope everything went your way. Before we go any further, I do want
[01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:51.340]  to give a huge, huge shout out to Kind Pain Management in Denver, Colorado. They do not
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:55.660]  sponsor the show. They are not supporters of the show, but what they are doing is they
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:59.900]  are growing Lemon Jeffery, which is a strain I bred. I put that together and I got some
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:04.260]  seeds in their hands, and they are killing it. They have posted some lab tests up on
[01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:09.380]  their Instagram feed. They're hitting over 26% THC on the Lemon Jeffery, and the best
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:14.660]  part is it is on shelves now. You can head to Kind Pain Management. They are a medical
[01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:18.820]  and a recreational facility, so anybody can grab some Lemon Jeffery, check out what I
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:23.260]  bred, check out what Kind Pain Management did with it. Big, huge shout out to them.
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:28.620]  One thing I want to do on this podcast is check out a video that somebody sent to me
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:34.180]  of three ex-cops smoking weed. The video is six minutes long. I'm going to watch the whole
[01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:37.500]  thing. I may edit parts of this out of the podcast so that you guys don't have to sit
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:41.740]  through six whole minutes. I may skip through parts of it. We'll see how my ADD kicks in
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:45.940]  as we do this. I think this is a great video. We're going to watch parts of it, and then
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:51.380]  we will talk about it. Let me kill the theme song, and we are going to play this cops smoking
[01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:56.940]  weed video. It starts off with some dubstep-y music. I don't know what that's called, but
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:03.780]  some really ... some music. It shows three older dudes, old enough to be our fathers,
[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:06.060]  taking bong rips. Then here's what they have to say.
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:11.980]  The last time I smoked was in probably 1968 when I was in college.
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:17.900]  First time I smoked, I was 14 years old. I got caught the first time I smoked.
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:18.900]  For some reason ...
[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:20.620]  I could kibosh on that for a while.
[01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:26.140]  Tried it once. I'll tell you, I was on a waterbed with a very agreeable woman and listening
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:33.740]  to Rhapsody in Blue, which I know lasts for about 18 minutes and 40 seconds. It lasted
[01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:36.020]  for, oh hell, two or three hours.
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:37.020]  Okay, re-extend.
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:43.020]  All three of these ex-cops have just admitted to having used cannabis illegally in their
[01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:49.780]  life. Now what they're doing is taking a field sobriety test before they smoke any cannabis.
[01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:52.260]  There are three retired cops. They all know how to fuck with each other and give each
[01:50:52.260 --> 01:50:56.500]  other a sobriety test. This one old guy has got such shitty old knees that he can barely
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:51:01.380]  pass the heel-to-toe walk. This says also that it was recorded in Washington where cannabis
[01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:04.460]  is legalized. They're keeping these cops out of trouble.
[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:08.020]  Cop number one now, they're in plain clothes. They don't look like cops. Their facial hair
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:11.420]  looks like cops, you guys. Plain clothes guy number one is now hitting the bong. He had
[01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:14.140]  the presenter of the video light it for him.
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:15.140]  My name's Reen.
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:16.140]  We'll let you hear him.
[01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:23.340]  I graduated from WSU in 1970 and went to work right in the same year and didn't retire until
[01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:24.340]  97.
[01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:25.340]  There you go.
[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:30.900]  Now this old dude's taking a pretty bad bong rip.
[01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:35.500]  That was a good rip. My name is David. I was a reserve police officer from 1997 through
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:36.500]  2004.
[01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:39.500]  Second dude took a pretty nice bong rip.
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:45.860]  My name's Robert. Went to police academy in the fall of 1970 and worked until the fall
[01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:53.100]  of 1986. And then after that, I taught as a freelance trainer, mostly for the criminal
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:58.900]  justice training commission. Taught at the police academy for nine or ten years.
[01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:02.380]  All right. So none of these guys knew how to carb. They've all taken a couple of fat
[01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:07.180]  bong hits and now it's starting to kick in. The one guy just said, so now what? We wait?
[01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:10.980]  And this is where the fun starts. The clock shows you five minutes have gone by and we'll
[01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:11.980]  let you hear what they say.
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:14.980]  I think I had him stuck on my mustache or something.
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:19.540]  Have you ever arrested someone for marijuana?
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:22.860]  You know, I thought about that a lot. And as far as I can remember, I never arrested
[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:26.860]  anyone for it, but I took a lot of pot away from people and threw it away in front of
[01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:31.260]  them. And I thought that was a bigger deterrent than actually writing a criminal citation.
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:37.780]  I think it should be legal. I think it should be more widely available for medical reasons.
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:40.060]  It's like the last piece of prohibition.
[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:42.900]  So do you believe marijuana is a gateway drug?
[01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:45.580]  I think it certainly can be a gateway. This is my favorite part.
[01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:47.340]  I'd like to respond to that too because...
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:51.860]  I'm going to pause it because the host is a little bit hard to hear on this show. His
[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:56.540]  audio is terrible. So what the guy just asked these cops is, do you think marijuana is a
[01:52:56.540 --> 01:53:00.700]  gateway drug? And I'm going to back up about just a couple of seconds here because this
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:05.260]  is honestly my favorite part of the video is this guy's answer. Okay. So they just asked
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:07.780]  him, do you think marijuana is a gateway drug? And I'll hit play.
[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:10.300]  Do you believe marijuana is a gateway drug?
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:12.860]  I think it certainly can be a gateway drug. Yes.
[01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:18.380]  I'd like to respond to that too because if you look at it, everyone who's a heroin addict
[01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:20.180]  started out drinking milk.
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:24.540]  So you're saying milk's a gateway drug?
[01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:29.460]  Apparently. I mean, that's the argument about marijuana and I'm not sure that's true.
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:34.500]  So that guy just said that milk is the gateway drug, you guys, because everybody that does
[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:38.500]  heroin started off drinking milk. I don't know if he really feels that way or if he's
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:42.820]  just too high and hasn't been high in years and that's what just came out of his head.
[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:46.980]  But that was my favorite statement from this whole video was hearing that cop say that
[01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:52.780]  everybody that is on heroin started off using milk. So milk is the gateway drug. Also, the
[01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:56.780]  one cop said he's never arrested people, but he's taken a lot of weed away from people.
[01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:00.940]  That's respectable. His job was to arrest people for weed and he didn't do it. So he's
[01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:03.060]  kind of on our team a little bit.
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:06.900]  The other cop said it should be legal and it should be more readily available for medical
[01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:11.940]  purposes. So I applaud these cops so far. Let's keep watching this video. Now this is
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:15.660]  15 minutes later. I don't know if this is 15 minutes from the time they took the bong
[01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:19.860]  hit or if this is 15 minutes from the clip that we just saw, which would put them about
[01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:23.260]  20 minutes into this stoned adventure. So I'm going to hit play, turn the volume up
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:30.020]  again and we will see what these old guys are up to. And that's the clock. So now they're
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:36.380]  smoking a joint. They're hitting the bong. Showing a montage. Now 25 minutes later.
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:39.940]  Starting at 93, count backwards by seven.
[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:42.820]  And now they're going to try to do sobriety tests.
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:43.820]  86.
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:49.740]  And the question he just asked him is fuck them. He said starting at 93, count backwards
[01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:53.300]  by sevens. I can't do that sober.
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:57.740]  Hold it for 20 seconds. Count to 10.
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:00.740]  Okay. How about five?
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:05.100]  So now they're doing the hold your leg up test and the guy couldn't do five seconds.
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:08.740]  This one guy, he did pretty good doing the heel to toe test.
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:09.740]  Better than before.
[01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:14.660]  Yeah. He said better than before. This dude was doing a heel to toe test a minute ago
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:17.500]  and I said that he was fucking it up because his knees were so bad. Now that he smoked
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:20.860]  a little bit of reefer, this dude just nailed the heel to toe test because his pain doesn't
[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:24.940]  hurt in his knees anymore. So they accidentally found a good reason to use marijuana. All
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:27.620]  right, I'm going to hit play on the video again. We'll keep going.
[01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:38.460]  I feel a little floaty. It's not unpleasant, but it's shadowed by the faint discomfort
[01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:43.260]  of not being fully whatever.
[01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:47.320]  Kind of what police officers do. They're very staunch. They're very in control all the time.
[01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:49.960]  This doesn't necessarily allow you to do that.
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:54.360]  This is actually pretty comfortable though. I mean, it's, it's relaxed and I don't feel
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:57.880]  like I have to be in control. It's pretty cool.
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:00.960]  So this guy's enjoying it and this is 45 minutes later.
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:04.920]  Legalizing marijuana is that it takes, I mean, some of the stuff you can buy in the street
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:06.160]  now, you never know what it's cut with.
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:09.680]  I don't agree with that. He's claiming that marijuana is cut with stuff, which is weird,
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:12.480]  but that's his own uneducated, you know, he doesn't know.
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:14.880]  Where it came from and what it's going to do to you.
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:23.040]  Well, yeah. And it also costs, you know, more to put somebody in prison, not jail, but prison.
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.040]  Then it costs to send them to Harvard.
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:28.720]  You hear that? It costs more to put somebody in prison than to send them to Harvard. Now
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:32.000]  they're playing the game where you put a card on your name and try to guess who's what.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.080]  We're going to skip part of this. It's unnecessary, but you guys.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:38.000]  I don't know. Given in the right circumstances.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.720]  They just asked, I'm going to back up two seconds. They just asked, would you do it
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:44.240]  again? Is the question. And here's their responses. I'm letting the YouTube video load.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:47.840]  I told my son on the way over here, I was, I had a pretty good headache coming on. And
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:51.120]  I think my headache started to clear up. I mean, it's going away.
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:54.800]  Would you do it again?
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:57.600]  I don't know. Given in the right circumstances, I suppose.
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:56:58.480]  Yeah. I'll smoke again.
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:01.520]  Probably given the opportunity.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:04.080]  So all three of these guys said they will smoke again.
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:09.120]  And since that was their answer, he wants them to hit the bong one more time.
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:11.040]  So they're all going to take, now this is great.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:16.400]  They're doing a montage of these three older dudes taking bong hits and smoking a joint.
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:19.840]  And it looks like, uh, like they're trying to make it a scene from, uh,
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:21.360]  the hangover or something. It's pretty good.
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:25.280]  All right. So I'm going to wrap up this video because I honestly don't know how much I was
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:29.200]  allowed to play of that video without some sort of usage rights. Let me give a shout out to the
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:33.360]  person that posted it. I found it on YouTube. It's by cut video. Make sure you subscribe to
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:39.920]  them. They've got 587, 139 followers, 140 for them. Uh, they would appreciate that. I'm going
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:43.520]  to go ahead and click like on this video. So they can get some credit there, but make sure you check
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:46.880]  it out guys. It's a funny video. You're going to want to watch it yourself. All right. Now that
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:51.120]  we've gotten through watching that video, let me talk about it a little bit. Uh, one thing I really
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:55.280]  liked is that these dudes seemed open-minded. They didn't remind me of a lot of the cops that
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:59.120]  I've dealt with that are real standoffish and think they have to be in control of everything.
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:03.040]  The one cop actually said that that's a cop's job is to be in control. And once he smoked a
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:07.600]  little bit of reefer, he wanted to relax and lighten up and not be such a prick of a cop.
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:12.720]  So I liked that he was open-minded and wanted to participate. I liked that the one guy said it
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:17.600]  should be legal. And then what I really liked was that they all wanted to smoke again. They said,
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:22.400]  yes, we would do this again. So maybe those cops are going to go talk to one of their friends who
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:25.680]  is still a cop and be like, you know what, dude, we got stoned on this video and it's not as bad
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:30.160]  as you think. Maybe one of their friends is going to watch this video. Maybe this video is going to
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:35.200]  help people change their opinions of cannabis. And even if you're already a fan of cannabis,
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:38.800]  I recommend watching it because it was highly entertaining. Big shout out to whoever sent that
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:42.880]  video to me. I do not remember who it was, but I appreciate it. All right. That's enough of the
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:47.760]  video. I've got a few news articles that I'd like to share with you guys. This article, we'll just
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:53.760]  jump right to it. This article comes from the Pueblo Chief then, and it is written by Dan Sinta.
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:59.760]  No, it's actually written by Kristen M. White. So the headline says, extra marijuana tax money set
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:03.920]  to hit the roads. And I've talked a little bit about this in previous shows and it is finally
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:08.960]  happening. This was my recommendation. And now here you go. Here's the article you guys. It says
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:13.840]  the Pueblo West Metropolitan District will spend an additional $200,000 on roads in the community
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:17.920]  for the remainder of the year and a threefold approach that Public Works Director Dan Sinta
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:24.560]  outlined for the board recently. The extra money comes after directors agreed to allocate the $200,000
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:29.600]  it received from Pueblo County for marijuana tax money toward chip sealing already planned.
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:35.360]  This county will pay the $200,000 directly to its emulsion supplier, freeing up $200,000
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:43.760]  Pueblo West would have spent of its $350,000 budget for chip sealing this year. The highest
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:48.320]  need we have in the district right now has to do with gravel roads, Sinta told directors.
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:52.960]  We have 6.2 miles of gravel roads that when we have the storms we've had this spring,
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:58.880]  the clay underneath fails and some stretches are impassable. It would be our intent to start
[01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:03.680]  attacking the repair of those roads as soon as possible. We propose to bring in additional staff,
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:08.480]  equipment and additional gravel. So I have recommended this several times. You guys,
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:12.080]  I've said that we should take all this tax money that we're making here in Pueblo, Colorado,
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:17.200]  and fix some of the goddamn potholes all over the roads. Well, guess what? They have heard us.
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:21.360]  The people have spoken, the people listened, and now they're going to fix the roads with all of
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:25.680]  that tax money. So big shout out to the city of Pueblo for actually doing something about the
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:29.600]  roads. Of course, they're starting with dirt roads that are impassable, but once those are done,
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:34.640]  they're going to fix the potholes in my city so that my car will not sound like shit when I drive.
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:40.000]  Thank you. It's about time. All right, here's another news article. This one comes from Denver.
[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:44.080]  I actually found this news article in the Pueblo Chief then and big shout out to Mike.
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:49.520]  Make sure you guys follow Nemo Punk. I think it's Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter. Mike sends me a lot of
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:55.360]  news articles. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot, dude. We'll get right to this article. The headline is
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:01:00.000]  Raising the Bars for POT. This is something else that we've been talking about and hinting at on
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:05.600]  the podcast and things are finally coming around. The sub headline says, Denver campaign promoting
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:13.520]  use in over 21 establishments. This article is by Kristen Wyatt of the Associated Press.
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:19.440]  Then it says, Denver, beer, wine, or weed. Campaign is underway to ask Denver voters about
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:23.920]  allowing marijuana consumption in bars and other places that only allow people over 21.
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:28.880]  Activists who campaign for recreational pot legalization in Colorado have launched a petition
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:34.640]  to drive what they call limited social marijuana consumption at bars. The activists need about
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:40.960]  5,000 signatures to get the question on November ballots. It would allow bars or clubs to allow
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:45.760]  marijuana use as long as patrons bring their own weed and comply with clean air laws. That means
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:50.560]  the pot they consume would have to be edible or if smoked consumed on an outside patio the way
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:55.440]  cigarette smoking is regulated now. Outdoor smoking sites would have to be shielded from
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:01.040]  public view. If you guys don't know about the Clean Air Act, in Colorado, you are not allowed
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:06.240]  to smoke in a restaurant or anywhere that serves food or basically where the public is. You have to
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:11.760]  get a... Shit, I don't know the word. Tobacco shops have them, but you have to get a smoking
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:15.920]  license, like a tobacco shop or a cigarette shop. If you want to smoke in there, they apply for a
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:22.320]  permit and you're able to smoke in there. With the Clean Air Act, we are not able to smoke cannabis
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:26.720]  inside of a building, even if they do allow it. We're going to have to step outside to an outdoor
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:30.880]  area that is shielded from public view. I'll jump into the article a little bit more here.
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:36.160]  It says, marijuana is now... I don't like how they worded that. I'm going to read it the way it
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:39.680]  should have been written. It says, marijuana is now a legal product for adults in Denver,
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:44.400]  and it's really time that we give adults a place to use it legally and socially, said Mason Tivert,
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:49.680]  who ran Colorado's 2012 campaign to legalize recreational pot. We shouldn't be requiring that
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:54.320]  you sit at home if you choose to use marijuana as an adult. I completely agree with that, you guys.
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:58.480]  There are so many places to buy dank buds in Colorado, but there's nowhere to legally go smoke
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:03.200]  it. This would change a lot of things. I think it would promote business. People, I wouldn't go to a
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:07.040]  bar. I have no reason to go to a bar. I don't drink alcohol. I don't want anything to do with bar
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:11.200]  girls. I don't want to do with bar dudes. I don't like drunk people. If I could go to that club and
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:14.960]  hang out and take a couple of dabs and hang out with my friends that are drinking, I would be way
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:20.080]  more inclined to go to the bar. Then I'd spend a few bucks there because I'd have to buy a soda or
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:24.240]  some sort of juice or shit to keep my mouth hydrated while I'm dabbing. Anyway, we'll keep
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:28.480]  going with the article. Colorado law prohibits recreational pot consumption openly and publicly,
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:33.520]  or in a matter that endangers others. It does not, however, bar against consumption in private
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:38.960]  over 21 clubs. The Denver measure would clarify what counts as a private club. That's something
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:43.680]  we've been struggling with here a lot in Colorado is getting a private club. Marijuana dispensaries
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:49.600]  are banned from allowing onsite use of products they sell and from selling alcohol or food that
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:55.440]  doesn't contain pot. The Denver proposal would only allow bring your own consumption. Denver
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:04:00.720]  wouldn't be the first city to allow marijuana in bars. Netherlands has a state statute allowing
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:07.120]  limited onsite consumption at over 21 clubs. So Ned, you can go smoke. I didn't know about that.
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:12.560]  In Colorado Springs, the state's second largest city has several marijuana clubs that are
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:18.080]  tolerated if not specifically allowed by statute. Colorado Springs Mayor John Southers has told the
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:22.960]  city council that he plans to seek regulations on the clubs. The Gazette newspaper recently reported.
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:30.000]  I've been to three marijuana cannabis smoking social clubs in Colorado Springs. And you know,
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:34.480]  it's kind of cool to be able to go and hang out and just smoke. There is the 420 speakeasy. There's
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:40.320]  the lazy lion. And then there's the original speakeasy. And you as a an adult 21 or over can
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:46.400]  go into these places. And you can have a dab of your own out of their rig. You can bring your rig
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:50.960]  or a lot of them have a dab bar that will sell you dabs. Some of them you have to pay a little fee
[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:54.560]  to get in a little cover charge. But if you're an out of towner and you want to come hang out and
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:58.000]  take some dabs with some Colorado kids, you know, there's nothing wrong with going to one of those
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:02.960]  places. It's actually pretty damn fun. I ended up at a kind of a secretive place in Denver,
[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:07.520]  taking dabs all night at a speakeasy up there. And it's just fun hanging out taking dabs in the
[02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:11.760]  club. We just replaced alcohol with dabs and it's way fun. I really enjoy it for some reason.
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:18.720]  All right, I need to continue with this article. Where are we? The Denver petition comes after
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:24.000]  that city council rejected pot friendly bars. Denver has several underground clubs where patrons
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.720]  use marijuana for a joining fee. But the city has intermittently arrested people for public
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:34.320]  consumption at those clubs. arresting for smoking weed again. Wait, I thought we're past that.
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:38.240]  Anyway, the raids and arrests leave tourists with nowhere to legally consume pot they've bought
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:42.960]  argued supporters of the ballot measure. Among the supporters is Jane West and events promoter who
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:48.000]  last year arranged classically cannabis concert with the Colorado Symphony Orchestra. The city
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.800]  threatened to block the concert citing public consumption laws. The symphony rebranded the
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:57.120]  concerts as a private bring your own cannabis fundraiser and the city dropped its objections.
[02:05:57.840 --> 02:06:02.480]  West was convicted of a misdemeanor for organizing a separate cannabis friendly event last year,
[02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:07.120]  a brunch at a bakery and a person SWAT team descended on the event and shut down the brunch
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:13.200]  West said. West became one of the first to sign the Denver petition. The petitions are due by early
[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:18.880]  August. So where's this petition because everybody here in Colorado needs to sign this. If you listen
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:24.800]  to this podcast, you agree with me that we need to allow recreational consumption in 21 and over
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:31.440]  establishments for adults out of public view out of indoor smoking areas so that we're able to
[02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:36.080]  medicate if we're a medical patient or we're able to recreate if we're a recreational smoker.
[02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:40.080]  We should be able to puff the people are at the bars getting wasted doing shots,
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:45.440]  fucking getting drunk getting into fights, raping each other being heathens. But the people that
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:49.840]  want to smoke a little bit of weed and relax are being singled out and I think it sucks and it's
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:54.880]  time for a revolution. It's time for us to be able to smoke in these clubs where we want to go.
[02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:57.840]  I think it'd be a good idea. I think it's kind of dumb that they don't allow it.
[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:02.400]  All right. Big shout out to the Pueblo chief then big shout out to Kristen Wyatt.
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:06.080]  You guys, if you're in Colorado, if you're a Colorado resident, find this petition.
[02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:10.640]  I'm looking to see if there's a link to it, but there is not. So we need to find this petition
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:17.040]  somewhere and we need to sign it each and every one of us. So that's enough of that article.
[02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:20.880]  Let's go to the next article. This article is a little bit long. Let me see how much time I've
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:28.240]  got left here in this show. So we've talked recently about the discussion between the
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:35.200]  natives and the government to allow natives to grow cannabis on native land or Indian reservations.
[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:41.600]  Recently, federal agents have rated two major marijuana grows on tribal county or on tribal
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:46.880]  land in Modoc county. So this article comes from, where is this? This is actually from
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:53.680]  krctv.com, which is a TV station in Southern California. And there is no, let's see, Megan
[02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:58.240]  Hunt is the author. So let's read this article. It says federal agents rated what appeared to be
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:03.920]  a large scale commercial marijuana grow on the pit river XL reservation and the Alturas reservation
[02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:08.880]  in Modoc county on Wednesday morning. Photos from the scene showed dozens of law enforcement vehicles
[02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:13.440]  at a large greenhouse site. There's also one photo of a bulldozer with what appears to be a
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:19.360]  load of marijuana plants in its bucket. According to Lauren Horwood of the USA, the US attorney's
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:23.840]  office, special agents with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Drug Enforcement Administration
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:28.480]  and other federal states and local agencies conducted a search of two large scale marijuana
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:33.760]  cultivation facilities located on federally recognized tribal lands at the Alturas Indian
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:41.040]  Ranch area and the XL ranch. At both sites, law enforcement seized a total of at least 12,000
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:45.760]  marijuana plants and over a hundred pounds of processed marijuana. Other than the contraband
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:50.880]  marijuana and items of evidentiary value, no tribal property was seized and no federal charges
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:55.600]  are printing, Horwood said. She explained that the search warrants are part of an ongoing investigation
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:00.560]  relating to the financing and management of a commercial marijuana cultivation project. The
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:06.560]  project warrant affidavits were unsealed until today. Horwood also said that while the US attorney's
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:10.560]  office doesn't normally comment on ongoing investigations, because of the public nature
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:14.960]  of this raid, they are releasing information. She explained that marijuana grows have received
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:20.080]  substantial attention in Modoc county as well as the US Department of Justice's guidance relating
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:26.160]  to marijuana cultivation on tribal lands. The cultivation facility at Alturas Indian Ranch area
[02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:32.640]  was located within the tribe's former event center within approximately 100 yards of the tribe's
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:38.560]  publicly operated gaming facility, the Desert Rose Casino. So these guys were growing a major grow,
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:43.680]  a hundred yards from the Desert Rose Casino where people go all day and gamble all day. That's kind
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:50.240]  of funny to me. The facility on the XL ranch was next to highway 395 on the banks of the Pitt River.
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:54.320]  Horwood explained that the Pitt River facility consisted of 40 newly constructed greenhouse
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:59.680]  structures, each capable of accommodating approximately 1000 marijuana plants and
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:04.720]  additional gable roof structures that boosted the square footage of roof covered structures by
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:10.960]  another 50%. That is a lot of plants. You guys, this dude had 40 green or this operation had 40
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:16.160]  greenhouses with a thousand plants each. That's the potential of 40,000 plants in those greenhouses
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:21.680]  plus stuff that was covered that increases their square footage by 50%, which is another 20,000
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:26.720]  plants if you do it mathematically, I think. All right, I'll keep going. Both of the girl
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:30.960]  operations, which appear to have been operating in conjunction with each other and were in excess
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:36.640]  of the locally enacted marijuana cultivation limits applicable to county land, Horwood said.
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:41.680]  I feel like I read something of that. They were both in excess of the locally enacted marijuana
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:46.480]  cultivation limits. So that's something that's kind of, if you're allowed to grow cannabis,
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:50.160]  if you're able to do that legally without being fucked with by the government,
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:53.520]  stay within your damn limits. Why don't you just stay in the limits? These guys were over
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:57.760]  their limits. They're growing too much. And that's what got them in trouble, which is a sign of greed
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:01.840]  and selfishness and not growing from your heart and growing from your wallet. All right, we're
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:06.320]  going to keep going on the article. It says the volume of marijuana that the XL facility alone
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:13.120]  was capable of producing estimated approximately 40 to 60,000 plants far exceeds any prior known
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:18.000]  commercial marijuana grow operation anywhere within the 34 county Eastern district, she added.
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:23.120]  According to tribal representatives, all of the marijuana cultivated at both facilities
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:28.400]  was intended to be distributed off of tribal lands at various unidentified locations. According to
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:33.360]  the search warrant affidavits, the investigation to date indicates both operations may have been
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:39.280]  financed by a third party foreign national. And you guys, I actually found the search warrants
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:43.600]  on Facebook for some reason. I was scrolling through Facebook and somebody happened to post
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:49.440]  the search warrants. And for some reason, I was completely enthralled with reading these
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:53.840]  search warrants and it was completely entertaining for some reason. I could not get my head out of
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:59.760]  it. But they said that this third party foreign national was a guy from Canada who owns Canadian
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:05.600]  cigarette companies who has got a history of drug convictions. So they got a Canadian guy
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:09.760]  coming to an Indian reservation who financed a major grow. He paid for everything and they
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:14.400]  were supposed to grow the cannabis, distribute this and allegedly get him his portion and keep
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:20.880]  the operation going. I was amazed that I found the search warrants and all of the stuff written up.
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:24.800]  If you guys ever get a chance to read a technical document like that, do it just for fun. If you're
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:28.480]  one of those kinds of people, some people are into that shit, you'll get a kick out of it.
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:33.120]  It was really neat. They will not give the snitches names. They call them confidential
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:37.920]  informants and give a long excuse why they keep them confidential. They talk about how the raid
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:42.560]  happened. They talk about so many small details. You guys will start tripping out and wonder if
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:46.400]  you're being watched when you listen if you read a search warrant because there are so many small
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:50.320]  details that these guys fucked up on. They were getting their pictures taken. They were talking
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:54.240]  to people and all of that shit is in the police reports and in the search warrants and you would
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:59.920]  never assume that that shit's being told to police but so much of it was. Yeah. All right, I'm going
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:03.520]  to continue with the article if I can find out where the hell I was. All right, here we go.
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:07.280]  According to Horwood, the investigation of the cultivation facility search today indicates that
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:11.440]  both are commercial marijuana cultivation projects operated with the intent to transport
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:16.160]  large quantities of marijuana off tribal lands for distribution at various locations yet to be
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:20.560]  identified by the tribes, which is a concern to the Department of Justice because it goes against
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:23.920]  their guidelines. You know why it goes against our guidelines? Because they don't make any
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:28.640]  fucking tax money off of it. That's part of the problem. Horwood said that the U.S. Attorney's
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:32.880]  Office consulted with members and representatives of both tribes, which are federally recognized
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:37.680]  on multiple occasions before today's raid and reminded the tribes that cultivation of marijuana
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:42.320]  is illegal under federal law and that anyone engaging in such activity did so at the risk
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:47.280]  of enforcement action. She added they were also concerned because the large quantities
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:52.400]  violates federal law. It is not consistent with California's Compassionate Use Act and undermines
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:57.280]  locally enacted marijuana regulations. So basically, you guys, these guys got fucked because
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:02.320]  the the tribal laws and the locals said you guys are growing too much weed. You're going to get in
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:06.080]  trouble. And guess what? They went ahead and did it. And guess what? They got dealt with by the
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:11.360]  police. It's a little bit ridiculous. Don't fuck around, you guys. If you're allowed to grow cannabis,
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:15.120]  if you're a native, if you're not a native, whoever you are, if you're allowed to grow cannabis,
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:19.120]  don't throw it in their face and grow too much. Just follow the rules, grow what you're allowed
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:24.160]  to grow and be thankful. If you're in a non-legal state, do what you got to do. I can't encourage
[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:28.240]  you either way. But if you're in a non-legal state and you need medicine, grow what you can, do what
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:32.800]  you can. Be careful. Don't get caught. All right. In the search warrant that I read, you guys,
[02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:37.120]  they listed all of the strains that these guys were working with because the way that a lot of
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:41.680]  this started, they pulled over one of their transportation vehicles that was transporting
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:47.600]  plants from one grow facility to the other. And this guy had 1,000 one-gallon pots with babies in
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:53.040]  his Ryder truck or his Penske truck. And they listed off what he had. And dude, they had blueberry
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:57.760]  cookies in there. They had platinum OG in there. They had Girl Scout cookies. These guys had some
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:04.000]  great cuts. And I started thinking about it. The natives, the people we used to call Indians when
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:10.880]  we were kids, those guys are an agricultural culture. All of their culture is based on the
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:18.320]  earth and agriculture. If these natives that were growing these cannabis plants were the natives
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:23.920]  that we think of when we daydream about Indians, those guys in my mind would grow amazing cannabis.
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:27.840]  And I would love to have gotten a sample of the shit that they grew. I'd love to see what the
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:31.920]  natives are growing. I bet it's fucking dank just because that's what they do. They're outdoor
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:36.480]  people. They're connected with the earth. They're connected with plants. I could assume that they
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:41.600]  grow some dank, dank weed. Sounds like they're putting out a lot of it too. All right. What else
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:47.600]  do we have? I think that's all the news we're going to do because we're at 29 minutes and 50
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:52.160]  seconds and my next news articles are going to be a little lengthy. So they might go on the next
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:55.520]  podcast. They may get skipped. You never know how we're going to do it around here.
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:16:00.480]  So it's time to start wrapping up the show. But before I do that, I got to give a couple of
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:06.560]  shout outs. Oh, and also big shout out to everybody that's watching on Periscope. Right
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:10.240]  now I'm doing most of this podcast live on Periscope. There will be some editing done,
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:14.480]  but if you're watching on Periscope, big shout out, big shout out to Roxy Hula, big shout out to
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:19.360]  El Diablo. El Diablo just jumped in. Big shout out to Corn Dog. Big shout out to everybody that's
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:24.400]  watching me on Periscope. I really appreciate that. Let's see, who else do I need to give a
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:29.440]  shout out? Oh dude, a big huge shout out to Judy. What up Judy? Also a big shout out to Green and
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:35.040]  Healthy Wellness. A big shout out to Hunt, Damsel and the entire Terpex crew. And of course, John
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:40.640]  Randles Jr. Big shout out bro. Green and Healthy Wellness took very good care of me this weekend.
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:45.280]  I got myself a brand new Terpex t-shirt. So I'm excited. Big shout out to all those guys.
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:49.840]  Let's see. Yeah, it's time to wrap up the show. I don't have anything else left for you guys. So
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:54.560]  I will be back. I've got another podcast. It'll probably drop on Wednesday. So no,
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:57.600]  it'll come out Thursday. I do Monday and Thursday. I don't know why I say Wednesday,

[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:52.880]  Garden of Weeden, please come on the show sometime soon because my listeners miss you.
[02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:57.040]  Also, we're going to get Mike on the show again pretty soon. We got a lot of things planned out,
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:02.800]  you guys. Episode 100 is going to be coming out in October. We're just working toward that,
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:06.560]  and I'm super excited. We're going to try to do some celebration or something on episode 100. I
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:11.600]  hope you join me for that. You guys, I'm just rambling. Thanks again for listening. Until next
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:14.720]  time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:21:14.700 --> 02:21:17.820]  It was innocence and love's current resource.
[02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:39.990]  Yeah, what's up, cannabis community? It's time for episode number 84 of the Grow From Your Heart
[02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:45.910]  podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right. If you're a new
[02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:49.510]  grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
[02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:53.350]  cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[02:21:53.350 --> 02:21:57.830]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host, Ross the Jeff. Thanks again for joining me.
[02:21:57.830 --> 02:22:01.110]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band. They let
[02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:05.030]  me use their music on the show and I really appreciate it. Big thanks to Cat Coot and the
[02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:10.230]  entire Mystic Roots crew. Hope everyone's having a great day. Sitting across the table for me today
[02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:13.430]  is our good buddy, White Mike. How you doing, brother? Doing good, man. How are you doing?
[02:22:13.430 --> 02:22:17.590]  I am doing great. Had a quick day at work, had some time to record. I thought I'd have you come
[02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:22.710]  over and throw down a podcast before you go do your activism stuff you do. Right. We've got just
[02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:26.550]  enough time to get an episode in. Yes, we sure do. We got to get it out kind of quickly, but we'll
[02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:30.630]  get it going. We'll kind of get to the point here. So Mike's here. We're going to do some news.
[02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:36.470]  Doing some news stuff. Before we get too far, I do have to do one quick ad. This podcast is
[02:22:36.470 --> 02:22:40.310]  brought to you by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations
[02:22:40.310 --> 02:22:45.830]  in Colorado. They have a Denver location. It is 6271 Beach Street, or you can go to my favorite
[02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:51.670]  store. It's the Pueblo location on 618 East 4th Street in beautiful Pueblo, Colorado. Check out
[02:22:51.670 --> 02:22:55.510]  Hygro. They do have great pricing. They've got a great selection of indoor growing supplies.
[02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:59.830]  You can get your favorite nutrients at Hygro. And also when you are checking out, make sure you let
[02:22:59.830 --> 02:23:03.510]  them know that you listen to the Grow From Your Heart podcast and they will give you commercial
[02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:08.870]  pricing on your entire purchase. That'll save you a lot of money. Love that commercial pricing.
[02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:12.550]  Oh, it's such a fat hookup. It's actually a better hookup than what the employees pay or
[02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:16.310]  what the employees, yeah, what they pay on products. So they have been trying to use my
[02:23:16.310 --> 02:23:21.510]  coupon code. All right. Love it. So big shout out to Hygro for making the show possible. They
[02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:25.830]  really help me out every month. Also, before I go too far and it leaves my mind, I want to give a
[02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:30.790]  huge shout out to a guy by the name of Brian Meyer. I'm not sure if it's Meyer or Mayor,
[02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:36.230]  but Brian, big shout out, much appreciation. Brian hit that PayPal donation button and threw a few
[02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:40.470]  bucks at the podcast. So that'll help us with some upgrades. I'm working on getting a portable
[02:23:40.470 --> 02:23:45.750]  recording device. I want the Zune H6 so that I can take the show on the road a little bit more.
[02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:50.310]  My recording gear that I have now is kind of bulky. A little cumbersome. Yes. But the device
[02:23:50.310 --> 02:23:54.630]  I'm looking at, we'll be able to go to any event. We'll be able to go anywhere on the fly. I'll keep
[02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:59.510]  it in my backpack. We'll have podcasts coming from all kinds of crazy places. So those donations
[02:23:59.510 --> 02:24:05.110]  help a lot. That will work out in the very near future, hopefully. If anybody out there wants to
[02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:08.630]  sponsor the podcast, just send me an email. It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com. We'll get you all
[02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:14.630]  the information you need. We can get your product advertised to a target audience of about 5,000
[02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:19.190]  people per week, plus all the people that go back and listen to the cataloged episodes. So it's a
[02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:23.990]  really good idea to advertise with a cannabis-related podcast. Because I think that's
[02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:30.950]  all the advertising I've got. I've got some news articles here. The current news, Mike informed me
[02:24:30.950 --> 02:24:37.590]  of, today was the day that the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment actually decided
[02:24:37.590 --> 02:24:45.830]  to deny PTSD as a qualifying condition for medically recommended cannabis in the state
[02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:51.670]  of Colorado. Yep. So in Colorado, there are eight qualifying conditions and all eight of them
[02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:59.430]  were passed by the law back in 2000. So the CDPHE hasn't added a single qualifying condition in all
[02:24:59.430 --> 02:25:04.710]  that time. And this is the third time they've denied PTSD. I think PTSD is definitely a
[02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:10.230]  qualifying condition. It's bullshit that they're not allowing that. It definitely should be. I mean,
[02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:16.550]  in our days working the counter, how many people came in specifically saying, I've got PTSD,
[02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:21.670]  marijuana helps so much. I love that you guys are here. Absolutely. So are we, is the Colorado
[02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:25.350]  Department of Public Health and Environment basically giving their finger to veterans and
[02:25:25.350 --> 02:25:28.950]  telling veterans to go drink alcohol instead of consuming cannabis to help themselves?
[02:25:29.750 --> 02:25:36.710]  That's basically been the effect of their policy for the last decade or so. So guys, what they were
[02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:41.510]  trying to do is people that have PTSD, they were trying to get that as a qualifying condition to
[02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:46.150]  get your medical marijuana recommendation from the doctor here in the state of Colorado. And it has
[02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:53.990]  been denied three times now. We cannot get a post-traumatic stress disorder as a condition
[02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:57.670]  that is qualified that could be treated with medical marijuana.
[02:25:58.870 --> 02:26:04.070]  And it's not just vets. There's a lot of people out in the community that have PTS or PTSD and
[02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:10.150]  marijuana helps a lot of them. And now they can't sit down and talk to their doctor about
[02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:14.390]  using cannabis directly for that. They'd have to, if they wanted to join the medical program,
[02:26:14.390 --> 02:26:19.030]  have to have one of the other eight qualifying conditions, or at least here they can still visit
[02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:22.070]  the rec market and just pay a lot more than they would in our medical.
[02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:27.190]  Right. Which doesn't allow them to grow the product that they need. That's a big part of
[02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:31.590]  having your medical marijuana card is being able to grow or being able to assign a caregiver to
[02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:36.390]  grow for you. That's a big part of it. Right. Trying to do three plants in your backyard,
[02:26:36.390 --> 02:26:41.910]  or if that's allowed in your area and whatnot, it's just brutal difficult already. If you're
[02:26:41.910 --> 02:26:47.110]  already suffering PTSD, now you've got to protect yourself from all the paranoia that comes with
[02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:53.110]  growing marijuana for the first time. I think a large portion of the population has some form
[02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:57.910]  of post-traumatic stress disorder, whether it be childhood trauma, anything. You can see something
[02:26:57.910 --> 02:27:02.230]  very little when you're a child in that you're a psychology kid, a psychology student, something
[02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:05.590]  really little when you're a kid can really fuck you up permanently if you don't take it right.
[02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:11.670]  There was a study looking at kids in some of the rougher parts of Chicago, and it was like 80%
[02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:17.270]  of the kids exhibited some symptoms of PTSD. A lot of people have started calling it just,
[02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:22.870]  they've dropped the D. It's no longer a disorder. It's just post-traumatic stress. It's what the
[02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:30.230]  human body and brain does after a seriously traumatic incident sometimes. A lot of people
[02:27:30.230 --> 02:27:35.350]  coming home from war or that have witnessed domestic violence or been victim of domestic
[02:27:35.350 --> 02:27:39.670]  violence or have seen car crashes. I was going to say, I've seen somebody die in a car crash,
[02:27:39.670 --> 02:27:43.750]  and it's in the back of my mind every time we're on the highway. I always get a little flashback of
[02:27:43.750 --> 02:27:47.750]  that. I don't like U-turns for the same reason. Yeah. You've told me that amazing story there.
[02:27:48.470 --> 02:27:53.910]  Yeah. What I was headed for is I was going to imply that I don't know what event it is,
[02:27:53.910 --> 02:27:58.870]  but I know there's some post-traumatic stress in my mind from my life. That's why I said,
[02:27:58.870 --> 02:28:01.990]  everybody's probably got it because I don't have a significant event that I can recall,
[02:28:02.550 --> 02:28:08.150]  but I've seen some shit. I know that when I feel, even if you've got stress of the day,
[02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:12.550]  when you smoke, it distracts you and it calms that part of your brain down and it allows you
[02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:17.590]  to not obsess on that thought. It lets you break free of that a little bit.
[02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:23.030]  The big thing, a lot of the people that I know that were treating their PTSD with cannabis would
[02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:28.550]  talk about is the dreamless sleep. That was the big benefit that they'd talk about, at least when
[02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:35.430]  they were in the shop. It would stop their dreams? Yep. I barely dream and I attribute that to
[02:28:35.430 --> 02:28:40.150]  cannabis use because when I don't smoke, I have very vivid dreams just regularly.
[02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:45.270]  That's odd because people have asked me what I like to smoke. I say I like to smoke a heavy,
[02:28:45.270 --> 02:28:51.030]  heavy sativa right before bed because it makes my mind do that wandering thing. I close my eyes
[02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:55.030]  and I feel like I just dream instantly because I'm already right there at that state. You know
[02:28:55.030 --> 02:28:59.110]  what I mean? Because you smoke that really high, head high sativa and I just close my eyes and then
[02:28:59.110 --> 02:29:03.350]  my dreams are claymation and they just happen as soon as my eyes close. Then I sleep really well
[02:29:03.350 --> 02:29:08.310]  on a heavy sativa and I have huge dreams from it. That's kind of strange that it stops other
[02:29:08.310 --> 02:29:11.590]  people's dreams, which I'm not going to argue that if it's working for them, that's amazing.
[02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:16.710]  Do that. Right. Well, I asked you one day, you still dream bro? You looked at me like offended,
[02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:19.590]  like of course, why wouldn't I? I have amazing dreams.
[02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:25.750]  Yeah. I just assumed that the effect was something you got too because you consume way more than me.
[02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:30.550]  Sometimes I can control my dreams a little bit, but if I get too carried away, I wake myself up.
[02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:35.030]  I know I'm like, eh, don't influence this dream too much, but also kind of guide it a little.
[02:29:35.670 --> 02:29:38.550]  But if I push too hard, I wake myself up out of the dream.
[02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:41.110]  No, I haven't had a dream in like eight years. It's beautiful.
[02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:46.550]  Oh man, I dream constantly. I wake up talking, oh shit, or something like that out of a dream.
[02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:48.630]  Right. Yeah, it's funny. All right. So
[02:29:49.350 --> 02:29:53.830]  if you guys are working on getting medical marijuana in your area, in your state,
[02:29:53.830 --> 02:29:56.870]  please, while you're writing the bills, while you're writing the rules,
[02:29:56.870 --> 02:30:01.030]  please put in some sort of a clause that includes post-traumatic stress disorder.
[02:30:01.030 --> 02:30:04.310]  It's not something that you can see, but it is something that definitely exists.
[02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:09.510]  We need it for our veterans more than anything, but it's also for everybody. Let's be fair out
[02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:14.710]  there, you guys. Not all medical conditions are visible. That's something you got to keep in mind.
[02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:20.470]  Write the bill well. We here in Colorado, I'll assume that the CDPHE would be willing to add
[02:30:20.470 --> 02:30:25.990]  other conditions to the list of currently accepted conditions over time, but there's been
[02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:30.230]  countless applications at this point. I can't remember how many, but it's like 15 or 20.
[02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:35.430]  PTSD has been up three times and they've denied everything just flat out. Nope,
[02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:41.350]  not at this time. There's not enough research showing that there is a general effect and
[02:30:41.350 --> 02:30:43.750]  there isn't research done because it's not allowed yet.
[02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:44.710]  Not enough research. Talk to a veteran.
[02:30:44.710 --> 02:30:49.030]  Unless you're looking for harm, you can't do the research until very, very,
[02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:54.710]  like within the last few months recently. So these studies are being drawn up now. They
[02:30:54.710 --> 02:31:01.590]  will be conducted in the next year or seven. The findings will be out and become public knowledge
[02:31:01.590 --> 02:31:06.790]  10 years from then. And we're just going to keep letting people suffer. Or I mean,
[02:31:06.790 --> 02:31:12.070]  at least in Colorado, they can use the rec market or... I mean, it's not like the black market
[02:31:12.070 --> 02:31:16.870]  ever went away here. It has had to step up its game considerably to continue to compete, but-
[02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:19.590]  Yeah, the black market will never go away.
[02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:23.350]  ... there's still decent options. And then once the vet has the bud here in Colorado,
[02:31:23.350 --> 02:31:31.590]  it's illegal again. So it's no good here, but we didn't take a step forward today and that sucks.
[02:31:31.590 --> 02:31:36.070]  That's... Yeah, we stumbled over our own dicks once again. So make sure you guys include the
[02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:41.350]  PTSD when you write your new medical marijuana bill. That's my main point here. And the next
[02:31:41.350 --> 02:31:44.310]  time it comes up that we're trying to vote on this, make sure you support it because I fully
[02:31:44.310 --> 02:31:48.630]  think that PTSD is a qualifying condition. Get registered to vote. Marijuana will be on
[02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:51.590]  your ballot in the next two years. Yes, it will. Yes, it will.
[02:31:52.310 --> 02:31:56.070]  If it's not on the ballot in 2015, vote anyway and just practice that shit.
[02:31:56.790 --> 02:31:57.510]  There you go.
[02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:59.670]  Be ready for 2016 because it will then.
[02:32:00.310 --> 02:32:07.510]  So we talked a little bit in the last episode about the desire for Denver voters to want
[02:32:08.390 --> 02:32:13.190]  consumption in some establishments where people are over 21 and they're not smoking inside.
[02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:20.950]  On... Where's the date? Okay, it was July 9th. The Cannabis posted an update to that article and it
[02:32:20.950 --> 02:32:27.270]  says Denver voters favor limited pot use in bars. It says Denver Marijuana Poll, a majority of
[02:32:27.270 --> 02:32:33.030]  voters in the city support an initiative that would allow limited pot use, no indoor smoking
[02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:40.390]  at businesses, over 21 businesses such as bars. So it's been voted on. This article was written by
[02:32:40.390 --> 02:32:44.390]  Ricardo Baca from the Cannabis staff. I may skip part of it because we just need to get to the
[02:32:44.390 --> 02:32:49.110]  point here, but it says a majority of Denver voters support an initiative that would allow
[02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:53.190]  limited social marijuana consumption in businesses such as bars. According to a poll
[02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:57.110]  commissioned by the group behind the proposal, the Cannabis has learned exclusively. I kind of
[02:32:57.110 --> 02:33:00.950]  read that weird, but I think you got it. Yeah. The people that wrote up the bill
[02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:07.750]  paid for a poll and the poll says voters are going to support it. So fingers crossed. I mean,
[02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:14.310]  their poll doesn't... If you're really into politics, their poll says that voters support
[02:33:14.310 --> 02:33:18.710]  it by 56% if they add in the people that are totally not going to fucking vote,
[02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:21.510]  because they don't really give a shit. They're just like, sure, whatever.
[02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:24.150]  Sure, I would support that, but I'm not going to go support that.
[02:33:24.150 --> 02:33:33.510]  I would, but there's television on that night. So, but I hope it passes in 2015. The need for
[02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:39.430]  this is huge. It's huge. But the poll data does not look favorable right now if more of us don't
[02:33:39.430 --> 02:33:45.750]  get politically active. True. Well, it actually says the poll results say only 56% of likely
[02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:51.110]  Denver voters either strongly support or somewhat support the initiative according to the Democratic
[02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:59.270]  firm public policy polling. So 56% isn't a bold number. That's 6% away from losing.
[02:33:59.270 --> 02:34:02.150]  Yeah. And when you really look at the polling data, it's something like 30%
[02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:10.230]  are gung ho about it and 26% don't give a shit. It says here, for those against the initiative,
[02:34:10.230 --> 02:34:15.910]  31% strongly oppose and 9% somewhat oppose it while 5% said they weren't sure.
[02:34:15.910 --> 02:34:18.230]  Right. It was an automated telephone poll,
[02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:23.750]  and it's got a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points. So this is just a telephone poll. People
[02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:26.710]  on the telephone will say that they will do anything because all they got to do is sit
[02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:31.510]  there and press one for yes and two for no and three for English. That's all they had to worry
[02:34:31.510 --> 02:34:36.550]  about. So yeah, a lot of these people probably won't come out and vote. So the pollsters asked
[02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:39.910]  whether voters would support allowing the consumption of marijuana at private venues
[02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:44.310]  in Denver provided that the owner of the venue permits the consumption, access to the venue is
[02:34:44.310 --> 02:34:49.430]  limited to individuals 21 years of age or older, and smoking marijuana indoors is prohibited and
[02:34:49.430 --> 02:34:55.110]  any outdoor use is hidden from public view. Which that's all fair. That makes sense.
[02:34:55.110 --> 02:35:01.350]  It's really not that bad of a bill and it's fairly... Sorry guys, dabs and soda.
[02:35:01.350 --> 02:35:02.070]  Yep. I agree.
[02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:09.190]  It's a pretty fair bill. You got to be outside and it's got to be 25 feet from wherever public
[02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:16.470]  gather. So what I'm envisioning is a shitload of roof deck type establishments in Denver where
[02:35:16.470 --> 02:35:20.630]  they just... There's a couple of bars that were already doing this. And if you felt like being
[02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:27.350]  outside, you couldn't smoke up there. Tobacco were usually the last time I was up there, but
[02:35:27.990 --> 02:35:32.390]  now they're going to allow marijuana up there or at least 25 feet away from the public. So
[02:35:32.390 --> 02:35:34.790]  like in a little back courtyard, that's all fenced off.
[02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:39.110]  Yeah. There are several like Cervantes. Cervantes other side in Denver has got the
[02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:44.390]  perfect little area for smoking. That would be sweet. What's that other place where we go to?
[02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:48.070]  There are a lot of clubs up there that have nice little outdoor areas that would be beautiful to
[02:35:48.070 --> 02:35:53.350]  smoke in which to smoke. Yeah. So just let us do it. They say that they're gathering 5,000
[02:35:53.350 --> 02:35:57.750]  signatures to get the question on Denver's November ballot. Another one of the poll findings
[02:35:57.750 --> 02:36:02.070]  that Denver residents by a four to one ratio believe that alcohol causes more problems in
[02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:07.830]  the city than marijuana and also favors their side of the contentious issue. Denver voters have made
[02:36:07.830 --> 02:36:11.430]  it quite clear that they support treating marijuana like alcohol said Mason Tivert,
[02:36:11.430 --> 02:36:16.310]  a national pot activist and one of the primary authors behind Colorado's original cannabis
[02:36:16.310 --> 02:36:23.110]  legalizing amendment 64. He says voters approved measures to the effect in 2001,
[02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:29.750]  measures to the effect in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2012. And so it's not surprising that we're still
[02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:35.190]  seeing such strong support even among a more conservative voting population in an off year
[02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:39.910]  election. So people are supporting it more surprisingly than we had anticipated.
[02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:44.710]  Even a poll this good is a little surprising to people who follow this stuff. So I mean,
[02:36:44.710 --> 02:36:47.350]  I wish them the best of luck. If I lived in Denver, they'd have my vote.
[02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:52.790]  It says in the question that asked respondents if alcohol or marijuana caused more problems
[02:36:52.790 --> 02:37:00.070]  in Denver, 55% said alcohol, 13% said marijuana, 26% said both and 6% were not sure.
[02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:05.990]  So we're making it obvious here that alcohol is the problem and cannabis is the peaceful way to
[02:37:05.990 --> 02:37:10.870]  gather and celebrate and have a good time and relax. The last paragraph of the article says
[02:37:12.390 --> 02:37:16.950]  by more than four to one margin in Denver, voters cite alcohol over marijuana as a bigger source of
[02:37:16.950 --> 02:37:21.910]  problems in the city said Tivert. Anyone who has spent time in the Loto on a weekend evening or
[02:37:21.910 --> 02:37:27.030]  walked down Colfax Avenue on any given day knows that alcohol contributes to far more problems
[02:37:27.030 --> 02:37:32.630]  and far more severe problems than marijuana he said. Which if you go out on almost any major
[02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:38.790]  city, any big city on the weekends, if you go to the bar, whereas every downtown's got that one
[02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:43.670]  area where there's a nice congregation of bars and everybody goes there and about one o'clock
[02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:48.790]  on Friday night out of one of the bars erupts a big ass fight and half of the bar spills out and
[02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:53.030]  they all push the shit out of each other and then the cops come and a few people get arrested
[02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:57.430]  and then you hear about it Saturday. That doesn't happen at weed events and if it does,
[02:37:58.310 --> 02:38:00.710]  we shun those people from the community and they don't come back.
[02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:09.830]  Cannabis is a peaceful drug. Alcohol is the problem for sure. So I think if they let us smoke
[02:38:09.830 --> 02:38:13.910]  at clubs and stuff, I would go. I don't go to places because I don't drink alcohol and there's
[02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:18.470]  no reason for me to be there, but if I could go take a few dabs, I'd be more likely to go to the
[02:38:18.470 --> 02:38:23.190]  shows at the local venues because even though it's not my kind of music, I would go be social
[02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:27.350]  if I could go dab out and have fun there. Right. We're not anti-social. We're just sick of explaining
[02:38:27.350 --> 02:38:31.830]  that we don't drink. Yeah, I don't, I do not want a beer, but thank you. And no, it's not because
[02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:35.670]  I'm better than you. It's because I don't want to be an asshole. I'm a drunken asshole when I drink.
[02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:40.310]  Right. I wasn't an asshole. I just don't want the hangover anymore. Oh yeah, dude. The hangover is
[02:38:40.310 --> 02:38:45.750]  terrible. Yeah. I haven't had a hangover in 10 years. That's so great. All right. So when it
[02:38:45.750 --> 02:38:49.510]  comes time to vote, you guys, I want everybody that listens to this show that lives in the 303
[02:38:49.510 --> 02:38:55.190]  and the 720. I want you guys all to go. Was that right? You got those right. You looked at me like
[02:38:55.190 --> 02:39:01.750]  I was correct. I want you guys to go. All of you have to go vote. Do legalize consumption in adult
[02:39:01.750 --> 02:39:08.230]  places. Please do that. You're starting at the dabs, bro. I just noticed the Turpex. Well,
[02:39:08.230 --> 02:39:12.470]  since you're looking at the Turpex container, I've got a star that says dab review. The other
[02:39:12.470 --> 02:39:17.510]  day I went up to Colorado Springs and I visited my friends. I visited the lovely damsel. Hello,
[02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:22.870]  damsel. I hope you're listening. Hey damsel. I also visited my good buddy hunt and I saw Jordan
[02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:29.270]  and I saw the turpy boys and I also saw John Randall's junior and we all had a good time.
[02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:34.390]  And I took Danielle with me and we went up to the shop and I picked up some Turpex sour
[02:39:34.390 --> 02:39:41.110]  Durban sativa. And I got to say, bro, it is sativa as a mofo. I get super dabbed out when I
[02:39:41.110 --> 02:39:44.790]  smoke the shit. You're looking at me like, well, let's get a dab of it. Let me see the container.
[02:39:44.790 --> 02:39:53.430]  But herein lies the problem. This shit was so good. It only lasted a day. It lasted one day.
[02:39:53.430 --> 02:39:56.870]  That shit was awesome. I really approved of it. So if you guys can get your hands on the sour
[02:39:56.870 --> 02:40:02.150]  Durban at green and healthy can of green and healthy wellness in Colorado Springs from Turpex,
[02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:05.830]  I would definitely recommend that. Turpex is doing some amazing things down here.
[02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:10.550]  Shout out to the Turpex crew. They gave me, uh, they hooked me up with a white and a black extra,
[02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:16.310]  extra large Turpex t-shirt. So I'm now styled out in Turpex. I'm smoking it. I'm wearing it. I'm
[02:40:16.310 --> 02:40:20.550]  repping it hard. I like it. Let me get a dab for myself and then I'll get a dab for you. I know
[02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:26.470]  you like these little tiny dabs, tiny dabs. I've got stuff to do tonight. Gotta be. All right.
[02:40:26.470 --> 02:40:30.470]  Here's the dab for Mike. And while Mike takes that dab, I'm going to move ourselves into the
[02:40:30.470 --> 02:40:35.590]  next article here and we will read some news. Kill my Mike while I choke. Where's your buddy?
[02:40:35.590 --> 02:40:39.670]  All right. I got you. Mike is muted. Oh, you hear all that echo that cuts out. It's beautiful.
[02:40:40.390 --> 02:40:46.070]  All right. So we are reaching how much time are we in? All right. We're 20 minutes in. We're going
[02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:50.550]  to make this a little bit of a longer episode. Uh, the article says this is also from the
[02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:56.790]  cannabis and it was written by Jean Johnson of the associated press. The headline is one year in
[02:40:56.790 --> 02:41:02.950]  $70 million in pot taxes and other lessons from Washington. Uh, the sub headline, we get a headline
[02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:06.630]  and a sub headline now in articles. That's great. The internet is fucking up our heads.
[02:41:06.630 --> 02:41:12.070]  I was 250 million in marijuana sales. Washington still has room to grow as its ninth largest
[02:41:12.070 --> 02:41:17.990]  grower says. It's amazing. We could be so successful and unsuccessful at the same time.
[02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:22.710]  The article goes on to say Washington launched its second in the nation, legal marijuana market
[02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:27.190]  with just a handful of stores selling high price pot to long lines of customers. A year later,
[02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:34.470]  the state has about 160 shops open pot tax revenues have soared past expectations and sales top $1.4
[02:41:34.470 --> 02:41:41.590]  million per day. They're making $1.4 million per day on cannabis in Washington right now.
[02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:46.630]  And it also goes on to say, and who knows the industry might even start making some money.
[02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:51.030]  Uh, Washington pot farmers, processors, and retailers have complained all year that heavy
[02:41:51.030 --> 02:41:54.950]  state and federal tax burdens along with competition from an unregulated medical marijuana
[02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:59.910]  market have made it difficult for them to do business. But at least some relief is there
[02:41:59.910 --> 02:42:05.430]  as here this month, uh, two new laws take effect. One to regulate and tax medical marijuana and one
[02:42:05.430 --> 02:42:12.870]  to cut Washington's three level excise pot tax to a single 37% tax. That's higher than Colorado tax.
[02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:19.670]  Yeah. That's the big lesson between Washington and Colorado. Um, is that the free market applies.
[02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:26.470]  Um, we see it in Colorado. There are a lot of people that are, um, that have been smoking
[02:42:26.470 --> 02:42:32.150]  marijuana here for 40, 50 years. And the only time they visit the stores is for novelty,
[02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:37.590]  right. For the occasional selection. Um, for the most part, they're still buying marijuana
[02:42:37.590 --> 02:42:44.870]  where they used to because it's half the price. Yes. Or, uh, in Washington, the taxes are so bad
[02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:51.910]  that almost none of the locals are interested because they're taxing it. Um, like 75% or it's
[02:42:51.910 --> 02:42:57.910]  like 25% three different times. And so by the time it gets to the consumer, it grams like 60 bucks
[02:42:57.910 --> 02:43:02.150]  in what the fuck. Yeah. Who's going to pay that when you can just go to the dude on the corner
[02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:07.830]  and get it for 12 or 15. Right. Yeah. Okay. So the article goes on to say, despite some industry
[02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:14.070]  gripes and those tweaks to Washington's legal pot law, marijuana, uh, which, uh, marijuana law,
[02:43:14.070 --> 02:43:19.030]  which voters passed in 2012 to legalize marijuana for adults over 21 officials and legalization
[02:43:19.030 --> 02:43:23.510]  backers say the state's slow and deliberate effort to regulate marijuana has been a success.
[02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:28.950]  A year after stores opened on July 8th, 2014. Here's a look at the state of legal weed here.
[02:43:28.950 --> 02:43:34.470]  It says the taxes, uh, Washington racked up more than $250 million in marijuana sales in the past
[02:43:34.470 --> 02:43:40.630]  year, roughly $62 million of which constitute marijuana excise taxes. That's beyond the state's
[02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:45.590]  original forecast of 36 million. And when the state and local sales and other shops,
[02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:50.950]  other taxes are included the total payday for the state and local government tops $70 million.
[02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:57.910]  Okay. So the interesting number there is the 60 million excise tax in Colorado.
[02:43:58.630 --> 02:44:03.350]  Uh, the excise tax is what's supposed to pay that $40 million for schools.
[02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:09.110]  And we've already crushed in the first five months of this year, last year's whole year total.
[02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:14.470]  Nice. Um, because the standalone production markets only just now coming online. All the
[02:44:14.470 --> 02:44:19.990]  shops had to produce their own for the longest time here. And so that was the infrastructure
[02:44:19.990 --> 02:44:26.390]  we started with. And because of that, that excise tax was real small here in Colorado.
[02:44:26.390 --> 02:44:31.510]  And that's the huge difference between our taxes and their taxes is by the time it gets to the
[02:44:31.510 --> 02:44:37.830]  shelf, that excise taxes nuts. Yes. Only 10 million of theirs was in sales tax. We collected like
[02:44:38.310 --> 02:44:42.550]  60 or 40 or something like that. And then just sales tax.
[02:44:43.750 --> 02:44:49.750]  I hope when the nationwide legalization happens, I hope all these crazy taxes are done away with
[02:44:49.750 --> 02:44:54.310]  or adjusted somehow. Right. It's going to, it's going to have to come back down to reality or
[02:44:54.870 --> 02:45:00.790]  they won't matter so much because they're charging you 36% tax on a $2 gram, um,
[02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:06.710]  which is entirely feasible. Which, uh, from, um, they're made, they're growing a lot of cannabis
[02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:12.230]  right now. And in Washington, they may grow more than they're able to sell is something that I see
[02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:17.510]  possibly happening. So that really could happen. It could go really dirty cheap pretty soon here.
[02:45:18.470 --> 02:45:21.270]  All right. I want to see how long we've been recording and we might, yeah, we're going to read
[02:45:21.270 --> 02:45:25.190]  the rest of this article and then we're going to save the, um, yeah, I got one more article we'll
[02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:29.670]  get into. So the next sub headline in this article says, isn't legal weed expensive in Washington?
[02:45:29.670 --> 02:45:35.430]  And it goes on to say a few growers harvesting, uh, uh, by the first time, sorry, let me read it
[02:45:35.430 --> 02:45:39.270]  again because it's moving. There we go. With the few growers harvesting by the time the first store
[02:45:39.270 --> 02:45:44.870]  just opened the average price of a gram of legal marijuana spark spikes to nearly $30 last summer,
[02:45:44.870 --> 02:45:49.110]  about three times the cost in medical marijuana shops, where prices have been dropping as more
[02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:55.110]  weed gets harvested. In fact, Washington has harvested 13.5 tons of marijuana flower intended
[02:45:55.110 --> 02:46:00.710]  to be sold as bud, but stores have only sold about 10 tons. Some of the excess can be turned
[02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:05.350]  into marijuana extracts such as oil, but the harvest has helped drive down the prices to an
[02:46:05.350 --> 02:46:10.230]  average of about 1150 per gram. So I was a little bit right about that. They grew too much and it's
[02:46:10.230 --> 02:46:14.710]  getting cheaper. Nevertheless, that in addition to tourists eager to visit the city's historic
[02:46:14.710 --> 02:46:20.950]  first legal pot shop, his clientele primarily consists of customers in the 25 and older range.
[02:46:20.950 --> 02:46:25.030]  It's more of an adult demographic, but that's okay. He says they have jobs and they can afford
[02:46:25.030 --> 02:46:30.390]  to buy the product. Uh, the next headline says, so what's next? Rick Garza, director of Washington's
[02:46:31.110 --> 02:46:35.510]  liquor control board, soon to be renamed the liquor and cannabis board says he's proud of
[02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:40.710]  Washington's efforts at a meeting, the top at meeting the top priorities, the justice department
[02:46:40.710 --> 02:46:44.390]  laid out when it announced it would allow Washington, Colorado and other States to regulate
[02:46:44.390 --> 02:46:49.190]  marijuana, keeping criminal organizations out of the industry, keeping the marijuana in state
[02:46:49.190 --> 02:46:53.990]  and keeping pot away from the kids. Uh, it goes on to say the state adopted background checks and
[02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:58.710]  financial investigations of pot license applicants and cap the total amount of production to try to
[02:46:58.710 --> 02:47:03.430]  keep it in line with in-state demand. While public health advocates say they wish the state
[02:47:03.430 --> 02:47:08.070]  had done more to stress the potential harms of pot to teens. The state required strict packaging
[02:47:08.070 --> 02:47:11.670]  and labeling requirements to keep children from getting into the weed. They did the same thing
[02:47:11.670 --> 02:47:16.710]  here. We kind of set a little standard here. I think the products that appeal to kids also remain
[02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:22.070]  banned and no marijuana, cotton candy, or gummy bears. Uh, so Claude, you can't get the sweet
[02:47:22.070 --> 02:47:26.390]  stone bears up there. That's terrible. I'm sorry, bro. Yeah. Everything here is sold in the
[02:47:27.190 --> 02:47:34.550]  childproof packaging. So even the candy bars come in a pill bottle, essentially. So it's not like
[02:47:34.550 --> 02:47:40.310]  they look like what your kids eat or it can be confused easily. Yeah. And they're well labeled.
[02:47:40.310 --> 02:47:44.390]  They're well labeled. So the article wraps up to say this isn't the first time people have gone to
[02:47:44.390 --> 02:47:48.550]  Oregon to buy something either because it's cheaper or because they don't apply sales tax. He said,
[02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:54.390]  we saw it for liquor and we see it for tobacco. So they're making a ton of money in Washington
[02:47:54.390 --> 02:47:58.710]  and they may have grown too much cannabis, which is fine because they're pushing down the prices.
[02:47:58.710 --> 02:48:02.950]  Right. All right. I'm going to do this one more article. This is also from Washington.
[02:48:02.950 --> 02:48:06.310]  I know guys, I'm in Colorado, but I like to share the news from all over the place.
[02:48:06.310 --> 02:48:10.870]  This one says Washington cracking down on unlicensed medical marijuana stores. We don't
[02:48:10.870 --> 02:48:14.630]  even have to read the whole article here because that headline says it all. This article is by
[02:48:14.630 --> 02:48:19.510]  Martha, uh, Belial from the associated press. And I hope I said your last name, right?
[02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:25.030]  It said 15 unlicensed medical marijuana shops in unincorporated King County are on notice that
[02:48:25.030 --> 02:48:30.550]  they are violating the law. King County prosecutor, Dan Satterberg and sheriff John something said
[02:48:30.550 --> 02:48:35.190]  Wednesday that they were cracking down on these stores after Washington lawmakers amended initiative
[02:48:35.190 --> 02:48:40.230]  five Oh two to require licenses for all pot shops. The change in the law brought medical marijuana
[02:48:40.230 --> 02:48:45.670]  into the state licensing and tax scheme. Uh, Satterberg said the stores were notified by
[02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:49.830]  mail this week. And if they continue to operate as unlicensed retail outlets for the black market,
[02:48:49.830 --> 02:48:54.950]  they'll face civil and criminal ramifications. So these shops are not registered and they're
[02:48:54.950 --> 02:49:00.710]  operating like medical marijuana dispensaries. Uh, it says the 15 stores that received the notice
[02:49:00.710 --> 02:49:05.830]  include a seven in the white center, a neighborhood two in Skyway and six in the Eastern part of the
[02:49:05.830 --> 02:49:10.870]  County messages left at Northwest cannabis market in Seattle and military road holistic in Auburn
[02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:15.190]  were not immediately returned. Uh, there was no answer at Pacific coast natural medicine in
[02:49:15.190 --> 02:49:19.270]  Seattle or the solution rent in. So these people are not answering the phones because they're
[02:49:19.270 --> 02:49:23.190]  scared shitless. They're going to get raided. Probably. Uh, they're taking tax money from the
[02:49:23.190 --> 02:49:27.990]  state and operating in locations that would never be approved by the LCB. He said they are blight
[02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:32.790]  on the neighborhoods. They inhibit. That's, that's a matter of opinion. Um, he said the
[02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:36.790]  federal government is washing, watching how Washington regulates the marijuana industry
[02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:41.190]  and the success of the law depends on how well local jurisdictions deal with unlicensed retail
[02:49:41.190 --> 02:49:45.510]  stores. In addition to sending notifications to the 15 stores, County officials have notified
[02:49:45.510 --> 02:49:49.510]  landlords that there is an illegal business operating on the property. He said, this means
[02:49:49.510 --> 02:49:53.910]  that if the stores continue to operate illegally, the liquor and cannabis board can go in and seize
[02:49:53.910 --> 02:49:58.470]  all of the product. Uh, if the civil options don't work, they will consider criminal remedies. He
[02:49:58.470 --> 02:50:03.350]  said, we're not going in heavy handed on this. He said, we're telling them the new scheme has to be
[02:50:03.350 --> 02:50:09.750]  followed. The days of the wild, wild West are over. So we saw this kind of happen in Colorado.
[02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:15.830]  It's totally still, it just happened in our city. Like three weeks ago, there was just some dude
[02:50:15.830 --> 02:50:20.550]  who was like, yeah, I could do this. And just opened up a dispensary essentially out of his
[02:50:20.550 --> 02:50:25.270]  house. Oh, that guy has been going on for a while. That guy also was accused of blasting buds,
[02:50:25.270 --> 02:50:30.150]  uh, making BHO out of the buds and selling those buds that he blasted back on the black market.
[02:50:30.150 --> 02:50:36.150]  Right. Like he stood out and got turned in by people in the neighborhood or whatever. So,
[02:50:36.710 --> 02:50:41.190]  well, these guys have storefronts with advertising and they're advertising just like a normal store.
[02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:45.670]  And now they're going to either have to get rated. I hope they don't bring it to that because
[02:50:46.390 --> 02:50:50.870]  this is what sucks. You have a state that allows you to do this. And then people like this don't
[02:50:50.870 --> 02:50:54.710]  follow the rules and they fuck it up for everybody. So they're going to have to go in there
[02:50:54.710 --> 02:50:58.550]  and tell them to shut this down. And if they don't, they're going to get raided, bro. Right.
[02:50:58.550 --> 02:51:03.030]  The feds will come in and take all of their shit. Like at this point in Colorado, you just
[02:51:03.030 --> 02:51:09.350]  Googled the rules and then follow the path laid out and you can have your marijuana store. You
[02:51:09.350 --> 02:51:15.670]  just, you just follow the rules and do it. Or you can just put a sign in your front yard and get
[02:51:15.670 --> 02:51:20.310]  yourself a whiteboard and a couple of jars and a cash register and go to town out of your living
[02:51:20.310 --> 02:51:24.790]  room and wait for the cops to show up. And they will show up and you'll be charged with unlawful
[02:51:24.790 --> 02:51:28.950]  distribution of marijuana. You'll be charged with possession of marijuana.
[02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:31.750]  It's still a crime to do all that unless you're a dispensary owner.
[02:51:31.750 --> 02:51:35.750]  Yup. All right, guys, we've been going 30 minutes. That's enough news for the day. Hey,
[02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:37.670]  Mike, thanks for coming over, bro. Yeah, man.
[02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:41.750]  We got to wrap it up pretty quickly because Mike's got somewhere to be. Let's see, what else do we
[02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:45.110]  have on the list here? I've got a couple of questions from Periscope. I'm going to save
[02:51:45.110 --> 02:51:51.190]  those for another episode. I do need to remind you guys, naturesgreenremedies.com has changed
[02:51:51.190 --> 02:51:57.510]  their name. naturesgreenremedies.com has a new website. Make sure you check out thedankteam.com.
[02:52:00.470 --> 02:52:03.590]  Make sure you check them out. I don't have a coupon code for you yet. They're still rebuilding
[02:52:03.590 --> 02:52:08.630]  the website, getting everything going. So make sure you check out thedankteam.com. Give them
[02:52:08.630 --> 02:52:12.710]  a shout out. Much love, much respect. What's up, Yankee? I hope you're listening to this one, bro.
[02:52:12.710 --> 02:52:17.110]  Hope everything's going well for you. So make sure you guys follow me on Periscope, dude. I've been
[02:52:17.110 --> 02:52:23.590]  on Periscope quite a bit. My account is just rostedjeff on there. All the news you guys have
[02:52:23.590 --> 02:52:26.950]  been hearing, not all of it, but a good portion of the news that I've been bringing to you guys
[02:52:26.950 --> 02:52:30.950]  has been getting tweeted to me from Mike. So Mike, thanks for sending me all the news,
[02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:35.190]  giving us content. Happy to, bro. I've been doing two shows a week because you've got so
[02:52:35.190 --> 02:52:39.590]  much news content for me. You got to keep the people informed. That's the truth. It's so awesome,
[02:52:39.590 --> 02:52:44.550]  right? Prohibition was, it was just everything. No one questioned it when we were kids.
[02:52:45.350 --> 02:52:49.830]  And now that dam is breaking and it's more people start getting active and more people
[02:52:49.830 --> 02:52:53.910]  are informed. We're going to win. We're so fucking close. We are winning. We are winning. Yeah.
[02:52:53.910 --> 02:52:58.710]  There were almost a, the 50 50 line is almost crossed. There are almost more legal States than
[02:52:58.710 --> 02:53:02.950]  unlegal States now, which is when that crosses. I think that's when something will happen.
[02:53:02.950 --> 02:53:09.030]  We broke the population 50 50 line already. Nice. It's just the numerical state number now.
[02:53:09.030 --> 02:53:13.110]  Okay. There's like a hundred East coast States with like eight people in them.
[02:53:13.190 --> 02:53:18.230]  Yeah. Because they're the size of Denver. Okay. Before we get too far, I want to not forget to
[02:53:18.230 --> 02:53:25.030]  give shout outs to Mark Dank, Ravanne Arnie. Also a happy birthday to my cousin, Brandy. I don't
[02:53:25.030 --> 02:53:28.710]  know if you listen to this show, but Brandy, I love you. I miss you. I hope you're having a
[02:53:28.710 --> 02:53:33.430]  great birthday. This comes out on July 16th. That is her birthday. So if you guys are smoking a bowl,
[02:53:33.430 --> 02:53:36.870]  if you're taking a dab blowing up in the air for my cousin, Brandy right now, she was one of my
[02:53:36.870 --> 02:53:40.310]  best friends growing up. She's like my little sister. I love you a bunch. So happy birthday
[02:53:40.310 --> 02:53:45.190]  girl. Um, also, um, I'm going to talk about one more thing and then we're going to wrap it up.
[02:53:45.190 --> 02:53:51.030]  Dude. There's a guy on Instagram who calls himself Bobo blaster co he's got a website.
[02:53:51.030 --> 02:53:58.710]  It is burniture.bigcartel.com. That dude sent me this table. I've only had it set up for a day.
[02:53:58.710 --> 02:54:02.390]  Now I haven't had a lot of time to play with it, but the time I have had to play with it,
[02:54:02.390 --> 02:54:08.550]  I really fucking enjoy it. This dude makes custom coffee tables in tables. He makes bookcases. He
[02:54:08.550 --> 02:54:14.870]  makes shelves, but he installs an email in your table for you. So I have now got a coffee table
[02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:19.670]  with two email coils coming out of the end of it. Uh, I've got two rigs sitting on the table.
[02:54:20.310 --> 02:54:24.950]  Both of those nails are hot. We can walk over there and Mike and I can take a dab side by side
[02:54:25.510 --> 02:54:29.990]  and choke together. Uh, yesterday I took a picture. I had a couple, I have two friends that are a
[02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:33.350]  couple. They're already there together and they came over and I told them, go take a dab together.
[02:54:33.350 --> 02:54:38.150]  You guys, and so they got to go do a couple dab. I thought that was kind of sweet. So, uh, he
[02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:44.790]  painted the Irie genetics, Colorado logo on the tabletop. Um, it's a three foot, uh, long by,
[02:54:44.790 --> 02:54:49.430]  I think that's about two feet wide coffee table. Uh, it's got a little shelf on the bottom. Dude,
[02:54:49.430 --> 02:54:54.310]  it's super sturdy. The emails work, bro. I cannot complain about those emails at all.
[02:54:55.190 --> 02:55:01.270]  Yeah. It's a walk. Daniel was like, bro, what the fuck? Seriously? He just smiled big and yeah,
[02:55:01.270 --> 02:55:06.790]  it's incredible. We're going to have to demo it a little bit and really, really give it a trial
[02:55:06.790 --> 02:55:11.990]  and then we'll do a real review. But it, it, it looks this point, I can say it looks just beautiful.
[02:55:11.990 --> 02:55:15.910]  And so far it has worked. I've taken several dabs out of it. I've been dabbing out of it
[02:55:15.910 --> 02:55:20.550]  since yesterday. He watched me unbox it on Periscope. He actually was on, I did a Periscope
[02:55:20.550 --> 02:55:25.270]  video when it got here, I unboxed it and set it up. So Bobo got to watch me. So you guys, big
[02:55:25.270 --> 02:55:29.670]  shout out to Bobo blaster co check him out on Instagram. He's making furniture with an email
[02:55:29.670 --> 02:55:33.270]  built into it. Uh, if you don't know what that is, you just got to go check out either his
[02:55:33.270 --> 02:55:41.430]  Instagram or his website. It's furniture, like the word furniture with a B, uh, furniture.bigcartel.com
[02:55:41.430 --> 02:55:46.310]  and big cartel is just like a, a website. It's like an Etsy or a eBay or something. It's just
[02:55:46.310 --> 02:55:50.150]  a retail sales site where anybody can set up their own store. So make sure you check out
[02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:56.630]  furniture.bigcartel.com support my buddy. Uh, I endorse this product. I'm going to put it to good
[02:55:56.630 --> 02:56:00.630]  use. I'm going to beat the shit out of it. I'm going to play hard with it and see if I can't
[02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:04.070]  break it. We'll do everything we'd normally do with it. And then we'll give them a full review
[02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:07.270]  here in a couple of episodes, but make sure you check them out. Cause so far, I think it's a
[02:56:07.270 --> 02:56:11.350]  bad-ass product. It looks gorgeous, man. And that logo across the top is really, really good. You
[02:56:11.350 --> 02:56:15.590]  did a really good job. Thank you, bro. I appreciate it. I really do appreciate it. It's a great gift.
[02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:20.230]  Uh, I don't deserve that. I looked on the website to see what he sells these tables for, and I am,
[02:56:20.230 --> 02:56:24.710]  uh, completely grateful and appreciative of the gift you have sent me. Thank you, brother. I
[02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:28.390]  really appreciate it. All right, you guys, it's time to start wrapping up the show. I've got some
