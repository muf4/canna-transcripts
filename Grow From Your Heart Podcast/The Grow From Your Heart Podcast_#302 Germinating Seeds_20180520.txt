[00:02.300 --> 00:05.460]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:05.460 --> 00:06.700]  It's time for another episode
[00:06.700 --> 00:08.460]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:08.460 --> 00:12.100]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:12.100 --> 00:13.460]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:13.460 --> 00:14.780]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:14.780 --> 00:17.140]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:17.140 --> 00:18.460]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:18.460 --> 00:19.940]  or even someone who is just curious
[00:19.940 --> 00:21.700]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:21.700 --> 00:24.460]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:24.460 --> 00:26.420]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:26.420 --> 00:29.300]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:29.300 --> 00:31.120]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you
[00:31.120 --> 00:33.320]  by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:33.320 --> 00:35.080]  If you need new genetics for your garden,
[00:35.080 --> 00:37.680]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:37.680 --> 00:41.040]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:41.040 --> 00:43.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
[00:43.500 --> 00:46.080]  pack up the bong, or start heating up that dab rig
[00:46.080 --> 00:47.640]  because it's time for another episode
[00:47.640 --> 00:49.440]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:53.920 --> 00:55.000]  Yo, what's up, podcast world?
[00:55.000 --> 00:56.840]  It's time for episode 302
[00:56.840 --> 00:58.320]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:58.320 --> 01:01.320]  I'm sure you noticed a difference in the intro music.
[01:01.320 --> 01:02.960]  I do have permission from my friends
[01:02.960 --> 01:04.560]  in the Mystic Roots band to use their track.
[01:04.560 --> 01:07.480]  However, when I put these videos up on YouTube,
[01:07.480 --> 01:09.320]  YouTube flags every video
[01:09.320 --> 01:11.400]  that has got a Mystic Roots track in it.
[01:11.400 --> 01:14.520]  So, in an effort to prevent myself from pissing off YouTube,
[01:14.520 --> 01:16.660]  I am using my own original music.
[01:16.660 --> 01:19.040]  I will get permission from Mystic Roots.
[01:19.040 --> 01:21.400]  They've given me permission, we've got emails about it.
[01:21.400 --> 01:23.000]  Coots, my friend, we talk regularly.
[01:23.000 --> 01:25.580]  However, YouTube doesn't know that
[01:25.580 --> 01:27.920]  and YouTube doesn't know that we've had a conversation.
[01:28.560 --> 01:29.680]  So, until we can figure out how to get management
[01:29.680 --> 01:31.040]  to clear that with YouTube,
[01:31.040 --> 01:33.540]  I will simply be using my own music.
[01:33.540 --> 01:35.400]  The track you just heard was my own
[01:35.400 --> 01:38.280]  Rasta Jeff reggae creation using GarageBand, nice and easy.
[01:38.280 --> 01:39.160]  I hope you enjoyed that.
[01:39.160 --> 01:41.400]  If you've got some music that you can give me permission
[01:41.400 --> 01:44.480]  to use on the show, I would love some fresh new intro music.
[01:44.480 --> 01:47.480]  Send me an email, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:47.480 --> 01:49.360]  I'd love to feature your tracks.
[01:49.360 --> 01:51.280]  Welcome to episode 302, you guys.
[01:51.280 --> 01:56.100]  Today, I am smoking on some Tahoe OG, and it is tremendous.
[01:56.980 --> 01:59.660]  Crack and open the jar to give it a little smell.
[01:59.660 --> 02:02.180]  It smells exactly like what Tahoe OG
[02:02.180 --> 02:03.540]  is supposed to smell like, you guys.
[02:03.540 --> 02:05.060]  It's got some OG kush to it.
[02:05.940 --> 02:08.740]  It's got a little funky feel to it.
[02:08.740 --> 02:10.700]  It's got a hint of gasoline in there.
[02:10.700 --> 02:12.300]  Just a hint of gasoline.
[02:12.300 --> 02:13.820]  It doesn't overpower you with gas.
[02:13.820 --> 02:15.780]  It's got more of that OG kush,
[02:15.780 --> 02:19.780]  lower, earthy, coffee sort of a thing.
[02:19.780 --> 02:21.980]  Do you know how ice cream, coffee ice cream,
[02:21.980 --> 02:24.380]  smells like coffee but not extremely strong,
[02:24.380 --> 02:26.860]  but when you get close to it, you can smell that coffee aroma.
[02:26.860 --> 02:29.060]  That's kind of the coffee, the soft coffee aroma
[02:29.060 --> 02:30.900]  that comes with this Tahoe OG batter.
[02:32.020 --> 02:33.060]  I just smelled the microphone,
[02:33.060 --> 02:34.100]  thinking that that would help me
[02:34.100 --> 02:35.620]  smell the batter a little louder.
[02:35.620 --> 02:36.460]  It didn't work.
[02:38.060 --> 02:41.380]  It has got a nice, golden, buttery texture to it.
[02:41.380 --> 02:44.220]  It has got a very nice indica-dominant high to it.
[02:44.220 --> 02:46.860]  When I smoke this, my life slows down a little bit.
[02:46.860 --> 02:48.780]  My head gets a little heavy, my eyes get droopy,
[02:48.780 --> 02:51.860]  my arms feel like they weigh a little more than they should.
[02:51.860 --> 02:52.700]  I really like it.
[02:52.700 --> 02:53.980]  Shout out to our friends at Apothecary
[02:53.980 --> 02:56.660]  for the great Tahoe OG extracts.
[02:56.660 --> 02:58.420]  Great work, it tastes amazing.
[02:58.420 --> 03:00.180]  It's got me lit up, obviously.
[03:00.180 --> 03:01.500]  So I'm smoking on the Tahoe OG.
[03:01.500 --> 03:05.060]  Also, earlier I took some dabs of some Pure Love Shatter
[03:05.060 --> 03:06.540]  from our friends at Apothecary.
[03:06.540 --> 03:08.740]  I bred the Pure Love, so it was great to walk in and see it.
[03:08.740 --> 03:10.860]  The Pure Love is Zac Hayes to Arise.
[03:10.860 --> 03:12.460]  Shout out to our friend Zac Hayes.
[03:12.460 --> 03:13.620]  Miss you and love you, brother.
[03:13.620 --> 03:17.380]  We honor you every day by smoking strains named after you.
[03:17.380 --> 03:19.260]  All right, let's do some updates.
[03:19.260 --> 03:20.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, YouTube.
[03:20.620 --> 03:23.980]  I have got 202 videos to YouTube.
[03:23.980 --> 03:25.940]  By the time you hear this, there will be 202,
[03:25.940 --> 03:29.900]  possibly 203 YouTube videos up on the YouTube channel.
[03:29.900 --> 03:31.900]  So I'm caught up for now.
[03:31.900 --> 03:32.980]  Not completely caught up.
[03:32.980 --> 03:34.580]  Here's my intention, my idea.
[03:34.580 --> 03:36.980]  What I'm trying to do, iTunes and Stitcher
[03:36.980 --> 03:39.180]  will hold 100 episodes of my podcast.
[03:39.180 --> 03:41.140]  I am at episode 302.
[03:41.140 --> 03:46.140]  As long as I've got the 100 most recent in iTunes
[03:46.220 --> 03:48.460]  and then I get everything else up into YouTube
[03:48.460 --> 03:49.660]  and stay caught up right there,
[03:49.660 --> 03:51.460]  I feel like I'm mostly caught up.
[03:51.460 --> 03:54.460]  One day I will have every single episode up on YouTube.
[03:54.460 --> 03:57.220]  All 302 will be there when I'm at 302.
[03:57.220 --> 03:59.460]  It's probably gonna take to about 350 or 400, honestly,
[03:59.460 --> 04:02.300]  to catch up with myself, but I'm getting there.
[04:02.300 --> 04:04.580]  I am making equipment upgrades.
[04:04.580 --> 04:06.820]  I'm doing things that will speed up my productivity.
[04:06.820 --> 04:08.660]  It just takes time to be productive, you guys.
[04:08.660 --> 04:10.860]  Making YouTube videos is very time-consuming.
[04:10.860 --> 04:13.100]  Making the video doesn't take that long, honestly.
[04:13.100 --> 04:14.700]  It's getting the video to post to YouTube
[04:14.700 --> 04:15.540]  that takes forever.
[04:15.540 --> 04:17.580]  I complain about it constantly, I'm sure you guys know.
[04:17.580 --> 04:20.040]  A one-hour YouTube video will take three to four hours
[04:20.040 --> 04:21.140]  to post to YouTube.
[04:21.140 --> 04:23.180]  While it's happening, I cannot use my computer.
[04:23.180 --> 04:24.500]  My computer is basically stuck.
[04:24.500 --> 04:26.460]  It is a slave to YouTube at that time.
[04:26.460 --> 04:28.780]  Can't do anything, but we'll get caught up.
[04:28.780 --> 04:30.260]  I'm mostly caught up for what I feel like
[04:30.260 --> 04:31.420]  or I wanna do right now.
[04:31.420 --> 04:32.680]  I'll keep them coming.
[04:32.680 --> 04:33.540]  We'll keep you guys updated.
[04:33.540 --> 04:35.460]  So check out YouTube and search for
[04:35.460 --> 04:36.460]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[04:36.460 --> 04:38.260]  and check out the old episodes.
[04:38.260 --> 04:39.980]  See what you missed.
[04:39.980 --> 04:43.260]  Also, you guys, I put out episode 300
[04:43.260 --> 04:45.260]  and you guys loved it.
[04:45.260 --> 04:47.060]  Oh my goodness, thanks for all of the response
[04:47.060 --> 04:47.940]  on episode 300.
[04:47.940 --> 04:50.380]  I got so many emails, so many tweets,
[04:50.380 --> 04:53.020]  so many messages, so many high fives from my friends
[04:53.020 --> 04:54.620]  that I didn't even know listened to the podcast.
[04:54.620 --> 04:56.220]  They're like, dude, that episode 300 was good.
[04:56.220 --> 04:57.720]  You guys were having fun.
[04:57.720 --> 04:58.900]  Yes, we had a lot of fun.
[04:58.900 --> 05:00.900]  We got super lit, you guys.
[05:00.900 --> 05:02.380]  We hung out for like four hours.
[05:02.380 --> 05:05.240]  We recorded most of it, but I only put out about two hours
[05:05.240 --> 05:07.140]  because there was a solid two hours
[05:07.140 --> 05:09.700]  that was just us going, dude, I'm high, duh.
[05:09.700 --> 05:11.900]  And there wasn't nothing to say, nothing going on,
[05:11.900 --> 05:14.180]  just a bunch of dudes sitting here being stoned to shit.
[05:14.180 --> 05:15.940]  So I'm glad you guys enjoyed it.
[05:15.940 --> 05:17.740]  Thanks for coming and hanging out at the dab table
[05:17.740 --> 05:19.320]  with Kevin and Mike and myself.
[05:19.320 --> 05:20.680]  We had a great time recording.
[05:20.680 --> 05:23.140]  It's a pleasure knowing that you guys have fun
[05:23.140 --> 05:24.720]  just hanging out with Mike and Kevin and I
[05:24.720 --> 05:26.940]  when we're just being stoned and doing our normal thing.
[05:26.940 --> 05:28.100]  That means a lot to me.
[05:28.100 --> 05:29.580]  Thanks for the great response.
[05:29.580 --> 05:31.060]  I appreciate that.
[05:31.060 --> 05:33.580]  Huge shout out to my friend, Bo Nellis.
[05:33.580 --> 05:36.420]  We mentioned Bo Nellis from the Spliff podcast
[05:36.420 --> 05:38.960]  in the episode and she was listening to the show
[05:38.960 --> 05:41.380]  and she actually said that she was typing me a tweet
[05:41.380 --> 05:43.420]  when she got a shout out on the episode.
[05:43.420 --> 05:44.780]  So Bo, thanks for the tweet.
[05:44.780 --> 05:45.620]  Thanks for the support.
[05:46.260 --> 05:47.100]  Thanks for all the love.
[05:47.100 --> 05:49.140]  We look forward to getting your podcast back on the air.
[05:49.140 --> 05:49.980]  Look forward to hearing it.
[05:49.980 --> 05:50.860]  You said it's coming.
[05:50.860 --> 05:51.700]  I want to hear it again.
[05:51.700 --> 05:52.520]  We miss you, Bo.
[05:52.520 --> 05:53.540]  I miss your presence.
[05:53.540 --> 05:56.180]  I miss having my kindergarten teacher
[05:56.180 --> 05:57.980]  teaching me about cannabis and opening my eyes
[05:57.980 --> 05:59.100]  to cannabis in new ways.
[05:59.100 --> 05:59.920]  I miss you, Bo.
[05:59.920 --> 06:01.380]  I hope you're well.
[06:01.380 --> 06:03.340]  All right, you guys, I'm kind of rambling, it seems like.
[06:03.340 --> 06:06.580]  I think that Tahoe OG and the Dr. Pepper have got me going.
[06:06.580 --> 06:09.220]  So let's get right into an email.
[06:09.220 --> 06:12.020]  I've got two emails that kind of line up.
[06:12.020 --> 06:13.340]  I'm going to read one of them.
[06:13.340 --> 06:14.980]  I'll give a couple of quick details.
[06:14.980 --> 06:16.860]  Then I'm going to read the other email
[06:16.860 --> 06:19.060]  and I will give a lot of details.
[06:19.060 --> 06:21.460]  If you would like to email me, you can send me an email.
[06:21.460 --> 06:23.900]  It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[06:23.900 --> 06:24.900]  I'd love to hear from you.
[06:24.900 --> 06:27.100]  We can get your email right on the show.
[06:27.100 --> 06:28.820]  Make sure you check out the Patreon campaign.
[06:28.820 --> 06:31.220]  It's patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[06:31.220 --> 06:33.380]  All of the information you need will be right there.
[06:33.380 --> 06:34.220]  Check it out.
[06:34.220 --> 06:35.740]  So here's our first email.
[06:35.740 --> 06:38.700]  Does this guy say if I can use his name or not?
[06:38.700 --> 06:40.180]  Oh, you could probably see right through the paper
[06:40.180 --> 06:41.380]  if you watch the video.
[06:41.380 --> 06:42.220]  Let's see.
[06:42.220 --> 06:43.420]  This one says, hey, Ross to Jeff.
[06:43.420 --> 06:44.900]  I have a terrible dilemma.
[06:45.700 --> 06:46.820]  I'm a fairly new grower,
[06:46.820 --> 06:49.300]  only with two grows officially under my belt.
[06:49.300 --> 06:52.180]  I have a friend who uses sativa dominant strains to medicate.
[06:52.180 --> 06:54.340]  They are my favorite to enjoy also.
[06:54.340 --> 06:57.700]  And after helping him in a pinch after my last harvest,
[06:57.700 --> 07:00.300]  he asked if I could grow for his medicinal needs.
[07:00.300 --> 07:01.900]  So it sounds like this dude ran out of some herb
[07:01.900 --> 07:03.900]  and you gave him some of your product that you grew
[07:03.900 --> 07:06.260]  and he was impressed and now he's asking you to grow for him.
[07:06.260 --> 07:08.180]  That is a great way to get your foot in the door.
[07:08.180 --> 07:09.820]  That's a great way to become a caregiver.
[07:09.820 --> 07:12.180]  That's also a great way to feel some pride
[07:12.180 --> 07:13.740]  knowing that you're doing things right.
[07:13.740 --> 07:14.740]  So I'm going to keep going.
[07:15.580 --> 07:16.420]  He says, I agreed of course,
[07:16.420 --> 07:17.620]  but now I am having a problem
[07:17.620 --> 07:19.420]  with getting my seedlings going.
[07:19.420 --> 07:22.340]  I've burned through 10 seedlings of Irie genetic seeds
[07:22.340 --> 07:24.620]  and three Doc Johnsons this cycle.
[07:24.620 --> 07:25.820]  I've started from seed before
[07:25.820 --> 07:27.620]  and I've never had this problem.
[07:27.620 --> 07:31.060]  I built an enclosed three by two by one
[07:31.060 --> 07:33.820]  by half of a foot enclosure to start my seeds
[07:33.820 --> 07:35.820]  before moving them into a four by four tent
[07:35.820 --> 07:37.460]  with LED lighting.
[07:37.460 --> 07:39.260]  I'm running an LED grow,
[07:39.260 --> 07:41.260]  a LED grow light from a big box store
[07:41.260 --> 07:44.180]  paired with some CFLs to get the party started.
[07:44.180 --> 07:46.740]  The enclosure is lined with reflective material,
[07:46.740 --> 07:50.980]  humidity around 40% and temp from 65 to 70%.
[07:50.980 --> 07:53.660]  Small computer fans for fresh air and exhaust.
[07:53.660 --> 07:56.140]  I can't figure out why they are damping off.
[07:56.140 --> 07:57.880]  I even had tomatoes and peppers in there
[07:57.880 --> 07:59.340]  and they all did the same.
[07:59.340 --> 08:01.500]  Any advice is greatly appreciated.
[08:01.500 --> 08:03.700]  Thanks again and stay Irie.
[08:03.700 --> 08:04.640]  Then he signed it with his name,
[08:04.640 --> 08:06.620]  which I'm not sure if he wants read on the air.
[08:06.620 --> 08:08.900]  Then he says, P.S. I hit up your Patreon.
[08:08.900 --> 08:12.160]  Thank you so much for all that you do.
[08:13.120 --> 08:15.880]  So there are a lot of things that got my attention here.
[08:15.880 --> 08:17.560]  Thanks for the great email by the way.
[08:17.560 --> 08:18.560]  This is good content.
[08:18.560 --> 08:22.520]  This gives me a great platform to get on a rant.
[08:22.520 --> 08:25.560]  You've built a three by two by one by half foot enclosure.
[08:25.560 --> 08:27.240]  I'm trying to envision that.
[08:27.240 --> 08:30.560]  Three foot tall, two foot by one foot by half.
[08:30.560 --> 08:31.720]  Okay, I get it now.
[08:31.720 --> 08:32.680]  To start your seeds, I'm guessing.
[08:32.680 --> 08:34.100]  I think I have an idea.
[08:34.100 --> 08:36.160]  Before moving them into the four by four.
[08:36.160 --> 08:39.240]  So there are a couple of details that you left out.
[08:39.560 --> 08:42.960]  Um, are they dying before they make it to the four by four
[08:42.960 --> 08:44.980]  or are they at least getting that far?
[08:45.960 --> 08:47.360]  I'm not sure if they're even making it
[08:47.360 --> 08:48.980]  out of your enclosure.
[08:48.980 --> 08:50.440]  So you're saying that you're burning off the seeds.
[08:50.440 --> 08:51.700]  You're killing the seeds.
[08:51.700 --> 08:52.660]  They're drying up.
[08:54.120 --> 08:57.080]  I would recommend more humidity in that small space.
[08:57.080 --> 09:00.040]  I would get that humidity at least up around 50%,
[09:00.040 --> 09:02.880]  maybe 60 or 75% if you're starting seeds.
[09:02.880 --> 09:04.880]  Those little seeds want some moisture.
[09:04.880 --> 09:05.840]  It's getting too dry in there.
[09:05.840 --> 09:06.840]  That's why they're drying out.
[09:06.840 --> 09:08.240]  It's simply too dry.
[09:08.240 --> 09:09.680]  And I would get it a little warmer.
[09:09.680 --> 09:12.080]  You've got it 65 to 70.
[09:12.080 --> 09:13.680]  Cold and dry come together.
[09:13.680 --> 09:16.000]  When it gets cold, your skin gets dry, shit gets dry.
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.640]  So you're getting it too cold and they're drying out.
[09:18.640 --> 09:19.560]  That's simply what's happening.
[09:19.560 --> 09:21.600]  You need more heat and more water
[09:21.600 --> 09:23.680]  and that will create humidity
[09:23.680 --> 09:25.400]  and that's gonna help you out overall.
[09:25.400 --> 09:27.920]  Maybe just turn off those small computer fans
[09:27.920 --> 09:29.280]  for fresh air and exhaust.
[09:29.280 --> 09:31.600]  It sounds like you're just, you've created a wind tunnel
[09:31.600 --> 09:33.560]  and so you've got a seedling sitting right here
[09:33.560 --> 09:34.960]  and say the microphone is the seedling
[09:34.960 --> 09:36.000]  and this is your fan.
[09:38.360 --> 09:40.040]  Just blowing on them all day, bro.
[09:40.040 --> 09:41.120]  Just drying them out.
[09:41.120 --> 09:42.200]  Your dirt's getting dried out.
[09:42.200 --> 09:43.320]  Your seedlings are getting dried out.
[09:43.320 --> 09:46.040]  You just got too much airflow probably
[09:46.040 --> 09:48.400]  in that little tiny space and not enough moisture.
[09:48.400 --> 09:49.720]  I would add some humidity.
[09:49.720 --> 09:51.520]  I would increase the temperature.
[09:51.520 --> 09:52.360]  That would help them out.
[09:52.360 --> 09:55.560]  Now, there are a couple things that you left out
[09:55.560 --> 09:57.480]  that I'm not sure how to help you
[09:57.480 --> 09:59.480]  because I don't know what medium you're using.
[09:59.480 --> 10:00.360]  Are you using cocoa?
[10:00.360 --> 10:01.560]  Are you using soil?
[10:01.560 --> 10:02.640]  Are you using peat?
[10:02.640 --> 10:03.760]  Are you using a soilless mix?
[10:03.760 --> 10:04.600]  Are you in hydro?
[10:04.600 --> 10:07.080]  I don't know what kind of medium they're getting into.
[10:07.080 --> 10:08.440]  I don't know how far you've gotten them.
[10:08.440 --> 10:10.120]  I don't know how you're sprouting them.
[10:10.120 --> 10:10.960]  I don't know.
[10:10.960 --> 10:12.760]  So I can only help you so much.
[10:12.760 --> 10:17.640]  Also, how often and how much are you watering these plants?
[10:17.640 --> 10:19.920]  Are you soaking the shit out of them
[10:19.920 --> 10:21.840]  and letting them go from really wet to kind of dry
[10:21.840 --> 10:23.320]  or are you just barely keeping them wet
[10:23.320 --> 10:25.720]  by watering them really frequently?
[10:25.720 --> 10:27.160]  I'm not sure what you're doing
[10:27.160 --> 10:28.840]  so I'm not sure what your method is
[10:28.840 --> 10:30.520]  so I'm not sure how to tell you to adjust
[10:30.520 --> 10:33.240]  other than they need more water, they need more moisture,
[10:33.240 --> 10:35.200]  they need more humidity and they need more heat
[10:35.200 --> 10:36.520]  and it would probably help.
[10:36.520 --> 10:39.400]  So let me know what you're doing
[10:39.400 --> 10:40.960]  and I will follow up with you
[10:40.960 --> 10:43.080]  when I get your follow up email.
[10:43.080 --> 10:45.720]  But so far it just sounds like that small space
[10:45.720 --> 10:49.400]  is getting, it's too cold which sounds like
[10:49.400 --> 10:50.600]  it would keep the moisture in there
[10:50.600 --> 10:52.960]  but think about when it's cold, your lips get chapped,
[10:52.960 --> 10:54.920]  refrigeration creates dryness.
[10:54.920 --> 10:57.080]  So you're kind of making it too cold in there
[10:57.080 --> 10:58.440]  to keep your moisture in there.
[10:58.440 --> 11:01.240]  All right, now I'm gonna read this next email
[11:01.240 --> 11:02.680]  and it kind of coincides with this one.
[11:02.680 --> 11:04.880]  It says, hey Ross to Jeff, thanks for the show
[11:04.880 --> 11:07.320]  and all the cannabis knowledge you throw out.
[11:07.320 --> 11:09.640]  I joined in on one of your Instagram live feeds tonight
[11:09.640 --> 11:11.040]  and I really enjoyed it.
[11:11.040 --> 11:13.380]  I really liked the story about the guy you met at a show
[11:13.380 --> 11:14.960]  and traded the grateful dog with.
[11:14.960 --> 11:16.840]  You guys, that story will come up on a future episode
[11:16.840 --> 11:18.800]  also by the way, that is a great story.
[11:19.680 --> 11:21.880]  Then it goes on, he says, but I digress.
[11:21.880 --> 11:23.320]  How do you go about popping seeds?
[11:23.320 --> 11:25.040]  I've heard many different techniques
[11:25.040 --> 11:26.680]  that just get more and more complicated
[11:26.680 --> 11:28.440]  like soaking the seeds in water,
[11:28.440 --> 11:31.100]  then dipping them in mycos once they crack,
[11:31.100 --> 11:32.760]  then putting them in a damp paper towel
[11:32.760 --> 11:33.960]  till the tap roots pop out
[11:33.960 --> 11:36.640]  and then finally planting the seeds in soil.
[11:36.640 --> 11:39.320]  What's wrong with the good old finger in the soil
[11:39.320 --> 11:40.720]  and drop the seed in?
[11:40.720 --> 11:42.920]  What's the benefits from soaking a seed
[11:42.920 --> 11:45.440]  or doing the paper towel technique?
[11:45.440 --> 11:46.880]  Then he says, thanks again,
[11:46.880 --> 11:49.640]  you can use my real name from Aaron.
[11:49.640 --> 11:51.280]  Hey Aaron, thanks for the great email dude
[11:51.280 --> 11:53.280]  and also thanks for giving me permission to use your name
[11:53.280 --> 11:55.640]  because it cuts out a lot of do I do this or not
[11:55.640 --> 11:56.760]  and I like to give people shout outs
[11:56.760 --> 11:57.800]  and I like to share people's names
[11:57.800 --> 11:59.560]  if they want it on the show.
[11:59.560 --> 12:01.080]  I don't know if you listen but Joey Diaz
[12:01.080 --> 12:02.760]  said my name on the podcast a few weeks ago
[12:02.760 --> 12:04.080]  that made me fucking giddy
[12:04.080 --> 12:05.960]  so I'm sure that I make people a little bit giddy inside
[12:05.960 --> 12:06.880]  when I say their names.
[12:06.880 --> 12:08.280]  So if you want your name said, let me know,
[12:08.280 --> 12:09.760]  I will give you a shout out.
[12:09.760 --> 12:12.400]  Now let's get into these questions here.
[12:12.400 --> 12:14.600]  Lots of great questions on this email.
[12:14.600 --> 12:16.800]  Lots of good stuff to go over.
[12:16.800 --> 12:20.880]  The one, he says, what's wrong with the good old finger
[12:20.880 --> 12:23.320]  in the soil and drop the seed in?
[12:23.320 --> 12:25.720]  Nothing is wrong with that technique.
[12:25.720 --> 12:27.440]  That's the technique that I used to use
[12:27.440 --> 12:30.680]  until I became impatient and employed my new technique
[12:30.680 --> 12:33.080]  just to be a little more careful,
[12:33.080 --> 12:34.720]  to pay a little more attention,
[12:34.720 --> 12:36.040]  have a little more control.
[12:36.040 --> 12:40.040]  So this is how most people used to do seeds
[12:40.040 --> 12:42.080]  and also what's wrong with that technique
[12:42.080 --> 12:43.080]  is seeds are expensive.
[12:43.080 --> 12:45.280]  Cannabis seeds have become ridiculously expensive
[12:45.280 --> 12:48.280]  so when you're paying more than $10 per seed,
[12:48.280 --> 12:49.760]  you want to do everything you can
[12:49.760 --> 12:51.680]  to get every seed to count
[12:51.680 --> 12:53.720]  and when you're just putting them straight into the dirt,
[12:53.720 --> 12:55.640]  there's a lot of chaos that can go on there.
[12:55.640 --> 12:56.700]  There are a lot of variables.
[12:56.700 --> 12:59.700]  If you're not on top of things, you can kill those seeds.
[12:59.700 --> 13:03.620]  If you're just sprouting any other seed, they're cheap.
[13:03.620 --> 13:06.380]  They're less than a dollar per seed, most vegetables,
[13:06.380 --> 13:08.380]  but cannabis has gotten ridiculous.
[13:08.380 --> 13:09.460]  They're five to 15.
[13:09.460 --> 13:11.620]  I've seen $20 seeds out there.
[13:11.620 --> 13:13.900]  There's 10 packs of seeds going for 250 bucks
[13:13.900 --> 13:15.540]  of certain strains right now.
[13:15.540 --> 13:16.420]  It's not uncommon.
[13:16.420 --> 13:19.620]  So cannabis seeds are ridiculously expensive.
[13:19.620 --> 13:21.300]  What's wrong with the old finger in the soil
[13:21.300 --> 13:22.680]  and drop the seed in technique?
[13:22.680 --> 13:24.820]  Nothing if you know what you're doing.
[13:24.820 --> 13:26.180]  What this guy's talking about,
[13:26.180 --> 13:29.220]  I would get a solo cup with decent soil,
[13:29.220 --> 13:31.540]  something like, I hate saying brands,
[13:31.540 --> 13:34.160]  but something like Fox Farms,
[13:34.160 --> 13:36.420]  the Light Warrior or the Ocean Forest would work for you.
[13:36.420 --> 13:38.380]  Something fluffy like that with perlite,
[13:38.380 --> 13:40.060]  a decent starting soil.
[13:40.060 --> 13:41.020]  Fill your beer cup up.
[13:41.020 --> 13:42.740]  If you're gonna use like a solo cup or a beer cup,
[13:42.740 --> 13:44.500]  fill your beer cup up most of the way with dirt.
[13:44.500 --> 13:46.860]  Poke some holes in it in the bottom so you have drainage.
[13:46.860 --> 13:49.160]  Then before you put the seedling in there,
[13:49.160 --> 13:53.020]  water that pot, water that cup, water that dirt, saturate it.
[13:53.020 --> 13:56.580]  Then take your fingertip and I've got big fingers,
[13:56.580 --> 13:59.260]  so I would go about halfway to my first knuckle.
[13:59.260 --> 14:01.060]  I'd say for most people, if you're a normal sized person,
[14:01.060 --> 14:02.780]  go almost to the first knuckle deep in that soil
[14:02.780 --> 14:03.780]  and just poke a little hole.
[14:03.780 --> 14:05.620]  Doink, just put your finger in there.
[14:05.620 --> 14:07.320]  You only need to go,
[14:07.320 --> 14:10.220]  I'm trying to find something to measure the depth of that.
[14:11.220 --> 14:14.740]  If you're using lined paper, the length between the lines,
[14:14.740 --> 14:15.900]  that's all you need to go.
[14:15.900 --> 14:17.900]  The depth of the width of a pen.
[14:17.900 --> 14:19.820]  So however your finger,
[14:19.820 --> 14:22.180]  your finger, the width of it, go that deep.
[14:22.180 --> 14:23.460]  I know that's too many fucking words
[14:23.460 --> 14:24.860]  to describe what I'm trying to say.
[14:24.860 --> 14:25.980]  Just barely poke it in.
[14:26.700 --> 14:28.060]  You just need that seed to go under the dirt.
[14:28.060 --> 14:29.900]  So poke it and then set the seed there
[14:29.900 --> 14:31.860]  and then just push a little dirt right over it
[14:31.860 --> 14:33.380]  and just kind of tap it so that it's secure
[14:33.380 --> 14:34.420]  and then just leave it alone.
[14:34.420 --> 14:36.300]  Put it under a light and that seedling
[14:36.300 --> 14:37.540]  will grow up toward the light
[14:37.540 --> 14:38.940]  and the taproot will grow down.
[14:38.940 --> 14:40.080]  That's what seeds want to do.
[14:40.080 --> 14:40.920]  They want to grow up toward the light
[14:40.920 --> 14:42.460]  and the taproot wants to go down.
[14:42.460 --> 14:43.300]  That's what it wants to do.
[14:43.300 --> 14:45.300]  So if you put it in there and you take good care of it,
[14:45.300 --> 14:46.220]  that will work,
[14:46.220 --> 14:48.300]  but you have to keep it at the proper moisture level.
[14:48.300 --> 14:50.500]  You have to keep the room not too windy.
[14:50.500 --> 14:51.720]  You have to keep the lights on.
[14:51.720 --> 14:53.240]  You have to keep things right.
[14:53.240 --> 14:55.940]  And like I said earlier, with the price of these seeds,
[14:56.900 --> 14:57.740]  that's kind of risky.
[14:57.740 --> 14:59.260]  People don't have all day to babysit them.
[14:59.260 --> 15:00.140]  People can't risk them.
[15:00.140 --> 15:03.440]  So that's when we start employing these other techniques
[15:03.440 --> 15:05.660]  that get more and more complicated.
[15:05.660 --> 15:08.420]  You said like soaking the seed in water.
[15:08.420 --> 15:10.460]  I only do that with old seeds.
[15:10.460 --> 15:13.000]  If my seeds are fresh and fairly new
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.460]  and from a reliable breeder and I've gotten them recently,
[15:15.460 --> 15:16.940]  I do not do the soak.
[15:16.940 --> 15:19.760]  If the seeds are kind of old, I will give them a soak.
[15:19.760 --> 15:22.820]  So you've got some old seeds and you want to germinate them.
[15:22.820 --> 15:27.140]  I would start by soaking them in water for 12 to 18,
[15:27.140 --> 15:28.860]  maybe 24 hours at the most.
[15:28.860 --> 15:30.180]  Don't go more than 24 hours.
[15:30.180 --> 15:31.980]  They'll start getting gooey and you'll drown them.
[15:31.980 --> 15:34.940]  So only with old seeds, soak those.
[15:34.940 --> 15:38.180]  Then if you've got seeds that are not old,
[15:38.180 --> 15:39.760]  if you just got some irigenetic seeds
[15:39.760 --> 15:40.820]  from the Helladink seed bank
[15:40.820 --> 15:42.180]  and you're trying to get those started,
[15:42.180 --> 15:43.020]  here's what I would do.
[15:43.020 --> 15:45.060]  I would get a plate and I'd get a paper towel
[15:45.060 --> 15:47.100]  and I'd pour water all over the paper towel
[15:47.100 --> 15:49.180]  and fold that into quarters.
[15:49.180 --> 15:50.060]  Then I would tip the plate
[15:50.060 --> 15:51.760]  and let all the excess water run off.
[15:51.760 --> 15:52.740]  Just let that water run off.
[15:53.560 --> 15:54.540]  You want the paper towel saturated
[15:54.540 --> 15:56.140]  to where it's filled with water.
[15:56.140 --> 15:57.700]  Then just put your seeds right inside.
[15:57.700 --> 15:59.980]  So you got it folded into fours already.
[15:59.980 --> 16:01.540]  It's about the size of your iPhone.
[16:01.540 --> 16:03.940]  Put the seeds right in the middle and fold it one more time
[16:03.940 --> 16:06.180]  and then put that inside of a Ziploc baggie
[16:06.180 --> 16:08.140]  and set it on top of the refrigerator.
[16:08.140 --> 16:09.740]  On the plate, leave the plate,
[16:09.740 --> 16:11.720]  set the baggie on the plate on top of the refrigerator.
[16:11.720 --> 16:14.340]  Now, the refrigerator is gonna get a little bit warm up top
[16:14.340 --> 16:15.740]  but the plate is gonna give you
[16:15.740 --> 16:17.420]  a little bit of a buffer zone.
[16:17.420 --> 16:20.340]  That water inside the baggie is going to be trapped.
[16:20.340 --> 16:22.540]  You're going to create humidity inside of that baggie.
[16:23.380 --> 16:25.020]  You've got enough water in there to activate those seeds.
[16:25.020 --> 16:25.980]  They're gonna crack.
[16:25.980 --> 16:27.060]  They're gonna start growing.
[16:27.060 --> 16:28.340]  They're gonna stay alive in there
[16:28.340 --> 16:30.100]  because you've got all the air trapped in there
[16:30.100 --> 16:31.660]  and they're not gonna dry out.
[16:31.660 --> 16:32.820]  It shouldn't take too long.
[16:32.820 --> 16:37.220]  12, 24, 36, maybe 48 hours in that baggie.
[16:37.220 --> 16:38.820]  Now you've got germinated cracked seeds.
[16:38.820 --> 16:40.020]  You can see what's alive.
[16:40.020 --> 16:42.140]  You can see how long your taproot is.
[16:42.140 --> 16:43.900]  Don't let that root get too long.
[16:43.900 --> 16:45.200]  An inch or so is long enough.
[16:45.200 --> 16:46.860]  That's getting dangerously long.
[16:46.860 --> 16:47.940]  Once it starts getting that long,
[16:47.940 --> 16:49.100]  it's gonna start getting real leggy
[16:49.100 --> 16:50.180]  and it's gonna start growing funky.
[16:50.180 --> 16:52.820]  So you get that sprouted taproot
[16:52.820 --> 16:54.140]  and this is where you get the beer cup
[16:54.140 --> 16:55.140]  that we talked about earlier.
[16:55.140 --> 16:56.820]  The beer cup with holes in the bottom
[16:56.820 --> 16:59.620]  that's filled with soil that is already saturated.
[16:59.620 --> 17:01.440]  You guys, you want the soil already wet
[17:01.440 --> 17:02.880]  before you put the seed in there
[17:02.880 --> 17:03.900]  so that when you put the seed in there
[17:03.900 --> 17:06.500]  and you backfill it, you don't disturb it by watering it.
[17:06.500 --> 17:08.060]  So have it wet first.
[17:08.060 --> 17:09.800]  Wet the medium first.
[17:09.800 --> 17:11.140]  Poke your finger in there.
[17:11.140 --> 17:12.580]  You wanna go just a little bit deeper
[17:12.580 --> 17:14.280]  than you would have with a fresh seedling.
[17:14.280 --> 17:15.500]  If you've got your sprouted seedling,
[17:15.500 --> 17:17.160]  just go a little bit.
[17:17.160 --> 17:19.060]  Just maybe your first knuckle.
[17:19.060 --> 17:20.940]  Then set that seedling in there real carefully.
[17:20.940 --> 17:22.540]  Don't disrupt that taproot.
[17:22.540 --> 17:23.940]  You want the taproot pointing down
[17:23.940 --> 17:25.260]  and the seed pointing up.
[17:25.260 --> 17:27.540]  Set it in there, brush a little dirt over it
[17:27.540 --> 17:28.580]  and let it chill.
[17:28.580 --> 17:30.340]  Now, you've either soaked them
[17:30.340 --> 17:32.860]  and got them started for 24 hours to soften them up.
[17:32.860 --> 17:34.380]  Then you put them in the paper towel
[17:34.380 --> 17:36.580]  and you're checking them every six hours-ish.
[17:36.580 --> 17:39.460]  You wanna check them at 12, 18, 24 hours
[17:39.460 --> 17:41.740]  and get them into dirt as soon as they're starting to sprout.
[17:41.740 --> 17:44.620]  Now your seeds have successfully made it to the dirt.
[17:44.620 --> 17:45.960]  There's less risk when you've got them
[17:45.960 --> 17:47.500]  in that paper towel in the baggie
[17:47.500 --> 17:48.780]  because they can't dry out.
[17:48.780 --> 17:52.180]  And drying out seems to be what's killing everybody's seeds.
[17:52.180 --> 17:54.940]  Also, I do not like a heat mat for the seeds.
[17:54.940 --> 17:56.540]  I said put them on top of the fridge.
[17:56.540 --> 17:57.420]  That's not much heat.
[17:57.420 --> 17:58.580]  It's very little heat.
[17:58.580 --> 18:00.260]  You've got them up on top of the refrigerator.
[18:00.260 --> 18:02.100]  There's a plate and then they're in the baggie.
[18:02.100 --> 18:03.340]  That's very little heat.
[18:03.340 --> 18:05.140]  Those heat mats, you guys, get out of control.
[18:05.140 --> 18:06.340]  They're hard to regulate.
[18:06.340 --> 18:09.220]  You guys buy those seed sprouting mats at the hydro store?
[18:09.220 --> 18:10.360]  They're unreliable.
[18:10.360 --> 18:11.460]  I don't fucking like them.
[18:11.460 --> 18:12.300]  Don't use those.
[18:12.300 --> 18:13.700]  You're just gonna cook your seeds.
[18:13.700 --> 18:15.740]  I also think you're gonna cook your clones with those.
[18:15.740 --> 18:16.620]  I don't like them.
[18:16.620 --> 18:17.460]  I don't use those.
[18:18.300 --> 18:19.780]  I don't get rid of them.
[18:19.780 --> 18:22.820]  You also said putting mycos or something in them
[18:22.820 --> 18:23.900]  once they crack.
[18:23.900 --> 18:26.260]  I don't find that necessary unless you've got old seeds.
[18:26.260 --> 18:28.100]  Good young seeds have enough energy
[18:28.100 --> 18:29.460]  to get themselves started.
[18:29.460 --> 18:31.140]  They've got enough energy to start their life.
[18:31.140 --> 18:32.640]  That's their whole purpose.
[18:32.640 --> 18:33.740]  So once they start sprouting,
[18:33.740 --> 18:34.940]  their first set of true leaves
[18:34.940 --> 18:38.160]  is when I actually start giving them any nutrients at all.
[18:38.160 --> 18:40.460]  They get to go for five, maybe seven or 10 days
[18:40.460 --> 18:43.260]  before getting fed anything at all.
[18:43.260 --> 18:46.240]  So you've heard so many techniques.
[18:46.240 --> 18:47.560]  They just get more and more complicated.
[18:47.560 --> 18:48.400]  Soak them in water.
[18:48.400 --> 18:49.600]  I only do that with old seeds.
[18:49.600 --> 18:51.440]  Dipping them in mycos once they crack,
[18:51.440 --> 18:53.500]  that's kind of some OCD stuff and not necessary,
[18:53.500 --> 18:54.520]  but if you wanna go overboard
[18:54.520 --> 18:56.200]  and do a lot of things to your plants, that's cool.
[18:56.200 --> 18:57.040]  You can do that.
[18:57.040 --> 18:57.880]  It won't hurt.
[18:57.880 --> 18:59.040]  Put them in a damp paper towel
[18:59.040 --> 19:00.600]  until the taproot pops out.
[19:00.600 --> 19:02.200]  That's how I do it.
[19:02.200 --> 19:03.200]  Put them on top of the fridge
[19:03.200 --> 19:04.360]  and put them in a baggie.
[19:04.360 --> 19:06.720]  Inside that paper towel is a really good way
[19:06.720 --> 19:08.520]  to make sure you don't lose your moisture
[19:08.520 --> 19:09.760]  and ruin your seeds.
[19:11.840 --> 19:13.200]  Now that you've got your seedlings
[19:13.200 --> 19:14.960]  successfully into a medium,
[19:14.960 --> 19:17.720]  you're going to have to keep that medium semi-moist.
[19:17.720 --> 19:18.560]  I wouldn't soak it.
[19:18.560 --> 19:19.800]  I wouldn't have it soggy.
[19:19.800 --> 19:22.000]  You need some air in there for those roots to survive.
[19:22.000 --> 19:23.640]  They need air in the root zone,
[19:23.640 --> 19:25.120]  but also they need plenty of moisture
[19:25.120 --> 19:26.840]  to keep themselves alive.
[19:26.840 --> 19:28.480]  Those roots are just starting to develop.
[19:28.480 --> 19:30.400]  They wanna grow around and move around
[19:30.400 --> 19:32.640]  through that dirt and they wanna go find nutrients
[19:32.640 --> 19:34.420]  and they wanna find air and they wanna spread out.
[19:34.420 --> 19:37.080]  So encourage that by having it moist,
[19:37.080 --> 19:40.140]  but not too wet and also having some air in there.
[19:40.140 --> 19:42.380]  Plenty of oxygen is good for your roots.
[19:42.380 --> 19:43.700]  So don't let it dry out.
[19:43.700 --> 19:45.860]  Have plenty of humidity in the room.
[19:45.860 --> 19:48.180]  Don't get them too cold because seedlings don't like cold.
[19:48.180 --> 19:49.380]  That'll really slow them down.
[19:49.380 --> 19:50.780]  That'll really make them stagnant.
[19:50.780 --> 19:52.860]  That'll probably, you could kill them with too cold.
[19:52.860 --> 19:54.460]  So don't get them too cold.
[19:54.460 --> 19:55.980]  Have some humidity.
[19:55.980 --> 19:57.740]  Don't put fans directly on them,
[19:57.740 --> 19:59.260]  but have some airflow in the room.
[19:59.260 --> 20:00.780]  Once they start perking up,
[20:00.780 --> 20:02.260]  put a fan on them really lightly
[20:02.260 --> 20:04.180]  because if you don't, they will start stretching
[20:04.180 --> 20:05.660]  and getting kind of leggy on you.
[20:05.660 --> 20:09.760]  I like to keep a T5 light right above my seedlings.
[20:09.760 --> 20:12.080]  Just a little bit of T5 light is enough.
[20:12.080 --> 20:13.840]  Once you get them going, you can increase the light.
[20:13.840 --> 20:14.880]  You don't need a lot of light.
[20:14.880 --> 20:16.960]  Too much light may be slowing you down
[20:16.960 --> 20:18.760]  and speeding up your dry process
[20:18.760 --> 20:21.040]  and that may kill your plants by damping them off,
[20:21.040 --> 20:23.320]  which is the problems that people seem to be having.
[20:23.320 --> 20:25.920]  So here's a little tip also.
[20:25.920 --> 20:28.120]  Once you've got your seedlings in the medium
[20:28.120 --> 20:29.240]  and they're starting to grow,
[20:29.240 --> 20:30.480]  when it's time to water,
[20:30.480 --> 20:32.940]  don't go in there with your pitcher or your watering can
[20:32.940 --> 20:34.640]  and just fucking pour water in that cup
[20:34.640 --> 20:36.800]  because you're gonna disrupt that seedling.
[20:36.800 --> 20:38.940]  What I do is get a spray bottle
[20:38.940 --> 20:41.160]  and I put my water with a little bit of nutrients
[20:41.160 --> 20:44.680]  in the spray bottle and I go ahead and I spray that dirt
[20:44.680 --> 20:47.000]  and I spray it real lightly until it's saturated.
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.600]  That way I'm not going to disrupt my new seedling.
[20:50.600 --> 20:51.680]  You don't need to give it nutrients
[20:51.680 --> 20:54.260]  until you see the first set of true leaves.
[20:54.260 --> 20:55.920]  Those little shitty leaves where it sprouted
[20:55.920 --> 20:57.240]  and spread in half and popped open,
[20:57.240 --> 20:59.120]  I always tear those little bottom shitty leaves off.
[20:59.120 --> 21:01.200]  They never, they're always weak.
[21:01.200 --> 21:03.800]  So yeah, that's basically my rant
[21:03.800 --> 21:05.760]  on how to get some seeds started, you guys.
[21:05.760 --> 21:07.520]  Don't overthink it.
[21:07.520 --> 21:09.120]  Keep this in mind.
[21:09.120 --> 21:12.400]  Those seeds in nature were supposed to fall out
[21:12.400 --> 21:14.120]  of that plant at the end of the season
[21:14.120 --> 21:16.220]  and fall onto the ground and sit there
[21:16.220 --> 21:17.760]  and get rained on and snowed on
[21:17.760 --> 21:18.800]  and sit there through the winter.
[21:18.800 --> 21:21.320]  And then in the spring, when that snow melts
[21:21.320 --> 21:23.800]  and the water gets down into the soil,
[21:23.800 --> 21:25.600]  that's when it starts activating those seeds
[21:25.600 --> 21:26.900]  and they start popping up.
[21:27.840 --> 21:29.160]  Don't overthink it, you guys.
[21:29.160 --> 21:32.160]  Those seeds are supposed to be sitting in dirt outside,
[21:32.160 --> 21:34.400]  getting snowed on, and when the snow melts,
[21:34.400 --> 21:36.160]  that was what was gonna make them grow.
[21:36.160 --> 21:38.260]  You're probably making it too complicated.
[21:38.300 --> 21:40.300]  Just make seeds happen super simply.
[21:40.300 --> 21:41.380]  Don't overthink it.
[21:41.380 --> 21:42.320]  Keep them wet.
[21:42.320 --> 21:43.260]  Don't drown them.
[21:43.260 --> 21:45.220]  They wanna be wet but not drowned.
[21:45.220 --> 21:46.940]  All right, because I feel like I've talked enough
[21:46.940 --> 21:49.540]  about seeds, I wanna give a couple of shout-outs real quick
[21:49.540 --> 21:51.000]  and then we'll get to another email.
[21:51.000 --> 21:52.880]  I wanna give a huge shout-out to my friend Jade.
[21:52.880 --> 21:54.660]  Also a shout-out to my friend Tyler,
[21:54.660 --> 21:57.340]  Maddie E., and Dustin S.
[21:57.340 --> 21:58.660]  You guys, let's find another quick email
[21:58.660 --> 22:01.260]  on this pile of emails that I have got.
[22:01.260 --> 22:03.500]  Here is one from our friend, let's see.
[22:03.500 --> 22:06.260]  He signed it Raj, and we'll read it like this.
[22:06.260 --> 22:09.140]  Hey, Ross to Jeff, I have a male space bomber plant.
[22:09.140 --> 22:11.540]  I cloned it once to keep it alive through winter.
[22:11.540 --> 22:14.100]  The clone is an eight-inch tall bush with balls
[22:14.100 --> 22:15.820]  under 18 hours of light.
[22:15.820 --> 22:19.660]  Will it still be viable when I go to flower in the spring?
[22:20.940 --> 22:22.060]  Technically, yes.
[22:22.060 --> 22:25.440]  If you can keep that plant under 18 hours of light,
[22:25.440 --> 22:27.860]  that is the way to keep that plant in a vegetative state
[22:27.860 --> 22:30.220]  which will prevent it from flowering.
[22:30.220 --> 22:34.340]  However, it's an eight-inch tall bush with balls.
[22:34.340 --> 22:35.420]  It's starting to flower.
[22:35.420 --> 22:38.440]  If it's got balls, it is already starting to flower.
[22:39.500 --> 22:43.180]  It is probably flowering because it is root-bound
[22:44.420 --> 22:45.940]  or because it's not getting fed right
[22:45.940 --> 22:48.660]  or simply because the light cycle is off.
[22:48.660 --> 22:51.060]  If you're giving it 18 hours of light and it's flowering,
[22:51.060 --> 22:54.780]  I would recommend giving it 20 or 24 hours of light.
[22:54.780 --> 22:57.020]  Something's wrong if it's got balls already
[22:57.020 --> 22:59.460]  and you're giving it 18 hours.
[22:59.460 --> 23:01.340]  My question is, you've got a male plant.
[23:01.340 --> 23:02.460]  Unless you plan on breeding,
[23:02.460 --> 23:05.980]  why are you keeping a male plant alive through the winter?
[23:05.980 --> 23:08.300]  That seems weird unless you plan on breeding.
[23:08.300 --> 23:10.380]  And then you wouldn't wanna flower that in the spring
[23:10.380 --> 23:13.660]  unless, that male plant's gonna make pollen, not buds, dude.
[23:13.660 --> 23:17.220]  So if it's a male, I would just get rid of it now.
[23:17.220 --> 23:19.100]  And it's an eight-inch tall bush with balls.
[23:19.100 --> 23:21.140]  It's already flowering.
[23:21.140 --> 23:22.240]  That's a problematic plant.
[23:22.240 --> 23:23.300]  I would just toss that
[23:23.300 --> 23:25.420]  and get yourself some fresh seeds, bro.
[23:25.420 --> 23:28.100]  If you're trying to grow it in the spring, that's now.
[23:29.260 --> 23:31.540]  Depending on where you are, I would just get some seeds.
[23:31.540 --> 23:34.420]  Just order some fresh seeds from the Hella Dank Seed Bank
[23:34.420 --> 23:37.380]  at dankseed.store.
[23:37.380 --> 23:38.780]  Hey, Raj, if I confused you
[23:38.780 --> 23:40.280]  or if you'd like to tell me more about this,
[23:40.280 --> 23:41.300]  I'd love to hear more about it.
[23:41.300 --> 23:42.140]  Send me an email.
[23:42.140 --> 23:44.740]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[23:44.740 --> 23:48.880]  You guys know I love to answer all of your emails.
[23:49.880 --> 23:51.140]  All right, podcast world.
[23:51.140 --> 23:53.380]  How long has it been since you've been on a vacation?
[23:53.380 --> 23:54.420]  That's right, as a grower,
[23:54.420 --> 23:57.340]  I know it's nearly impossible to take a vacation.
[23:57.340 --> 23:58.600]  I like to go away for the weekends.
[23:58.600 --> 23:59.860]  I like to go see fish.
[23:59.860 --> 24:02.180]  I like to sneak away and go have a good time.
[24:02.180 --> 24:03.560]  Most of the time I'm gone,
[24:03.560 --> 24:04.400]  I'm just freaking out,
[24:04.400 --> 24:06.820]  wondering what's going on in my garden.
[24:06.820 --> 24:07.660]  But you know what?
[24:07.660 --> 24:08.540]  I don't freak out anymore
[24:08.540 --> 24:10.700]  because my friends at PL Grow Systems
[24:10.700 --> 24:13.040]  have sent me the most amazing device, you guys.
[24:13.040 --> 24:15.180]  I've got a device called the Minder.
[24:15.180 --> 24:17.220]  And with the Minder, I hung it in the grow room.
[24:17.220 --> 24:18.880]  I put a few things in the right spot.
[24:18.880 --> 24:20.060]  I went to a website.
[24:20.060 --> 24:21.060]  I created an account.
[24:21.060 --> 24:22.460]  I logged in.
[24:22.460 --> 24:25.300]  And now, wherever I am, I can open my phone
[24:25.300 --> 24:27.940]  and I can go to plgrow.systems
[24:27.940 --> 24:30.220]  and I can look at what's going on in my grow room
[24:30.220 --> 24:31.940]  from anywhere on the planet.
[24:31.940 --> 24:33.980]  As long as I've got a wifi connection
[24:33.980 --> 24:35.540]  and I've got my phone in my hand,
[24:35.540 --> 24:38.520]  I can see my temps and my humidity in my grow
[24:38.520 --> 24:40.540]  and I can make sure nothing's going wrong
[24:40.540 --> 24:41.660]  and I can stop freaking out
[24:41.660 --> 24:43.880]  and I can actually enjoy the fish concert.
[24:43.880 --> 24:44.940]  So ladies and gentlemen,
[24:44.940 --> 24:47.220]  I highly recommend the Minder
[24:47.220 --> 24:49.020]  for my friends at PL Grow Systems.
[24:49.020 --> 24:51.520]  You can find them at plgrow.systems.
[24:51.520 --> 24:52.900]  Check them out and let them know
[24:52.900 --> 24:54.200]  that Rasta Jeff sent you.
[24:55.580 --> 24:56.460]  All right, podcast world,
[24:56.460 --> 24:57.480]  I wanna thank everybody again
[24:58.000 --> 24:58.840]  for the great emails.
[24:58.840 --> 25:01.320]  I really appreciate the listener generated content.
[25:01.320 --> 25:03.300]  If you've got a question that you would like me to answer
[25:03.300 --> 25:05.140]  on a future episode, send me an email.
[25:05.140 --> 25:08.000]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.600]  I would love to hear your questions.
[25:09.600 --> 25:11.440]  Also, don't forget about Patreon.
[25:11.440 --> 25:14.020]  Patreon is a service that allows you as a listener
[25:14.020 --> 25:16.320]  to financially contribute to this podcast.
[25:16.320 --> 25:18.180]  I would like to give everybody a big thank you
[25:18.180 --> 25:20.080]  because I've been working toward a new MacBook
[25:20.080 --> 25:21.880]  and with the help of my Patreon contributors
[25:21.880 --> 25:22.920]  and a few other things,
[25:22.920 --> 25:24.840]  I was able to order the new MacBook.
[25:24.840 --> 25:25.800]  It's not here yet.
[25:25.800 --> 25:27.000]  It should be here by Thursday.
[25:27.520 --> 25:29.400]  So the next couple of episodes will be recorded
[25:29.400 --> 25:32.080]  on the new MacBook if things go my way.
[25:32.080 --> 25:34.040]  Thank you guys for the help.
[25:34.040 --> 25:35.560]  It's a huge deal because the MacBook
[25:35.560 --> 25:38.160]  I'm currently recording on is kinda taking a poop
[25:38.160 --> 25:39.680]  and it has me worried.
[25:39.680 --> 25:40.680]  It's frustrating.
[25:40.680 --> 25:42.360]  It's not as much fun recording as it could be.
[25:42.360 --> 25:45.280]  So I'm sure the new unit is going to make this a breeze.
[25:45.280 --> 25:47.560]  Thank you guys for the help with the new MacBook.
[25:47.560 --> 25:48.380]  I appreciate it.
[25:48.380 --> 25:49.840]  That means a lot to me.
[25:49.840 --> 25:52.480]  Patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[25:52.480 --> 25:54.120]  We've almost covered the cost of the MacBook.
[25:54.120 --> 25:55.240]  We got close.
[25:55.240 --> 25:57.280]  I just did it because it's time.
[25:57.280 --> 25:59.160]  The things that the Patreon contributions will cover
[25:59.160 --> 26:01.560]  are things like the new MacBook, the website,
[26:01.560 --> 26:04.680]  these microphone covers, the headphones,
[26:04.680 --> 26:06.280]  all these little pieces of equipment.
[26:06.280 --> 26:08.080]  They kinda crap out at random times.
[26:08.080 --> 26:10.680]  So the Patreon contributions are what I use
[26:10.680 --> 26:13.080]  to keep the equipment going, to keep the website alive,
[26:13.080 --> 26:14.640]  and to keep the computer up and running.
[26:14.640 --> 26:17.040]  So thank you for the Patreon contributions.
[26:17.040 --> 26:18.260]  You guys, if you're listening
[26:18.260 --> 26:20.360]  and you are unable to contribute to Patreon,
[26:20.360 --> 26:21.200]  keep listening.
[26:21.200 --> 26:22.860]  You don't have to give me money to hear my show.
[26:22.860 --> 26:23.840]  It is free.
[26:23.840 --> 26:26.120]  There are people out there who would like to contribute,
[26:26.120 --> 26:27.560]  who are able to contribute.
[26:27.560 --> 26:28.520]  They will cover you.
[26:28.520 --> 26:29.520]  Thank you guys.
[26:29.520 --> 26:30.920]  Thank each and every one of you
[26:30.920 --> 26:33.960]  for supporting and listening to my podcast.
[26:33.960 --> 26:35.720]  I would love it if each and every one of you
[26:35.720 --> 26:37.340]  stalked me on social media.
[26:37.340 --> 26:38.680]  You can find the show on Facebook.

[26:40.920 --> 26:42.120]  You can find the show on Twitter.
[26:42.120 --> 26:44.200]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[26:44.200 --> 26:46.180]  The show has a YouTube channel.
[26:46.180 --> 26:48.940]  There are probably 203 or more videos
[26:48.940 --> 26:50.960]  by the time you hear this on the YouTube channel.
[26:50.960 --> 26:52.360]  Go to YouTube and search
[26:52.360 --> 26:54.240]  for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[26:54.240 --> 26:56.620]  Also, don't forget about my Instagram.
[26:56.620 --> 26:59.520]  I am IrieGenetics on Instagram.
[26:59.520 --> 27:03.960]  I-R-I-E underscore G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S
[27:03.960 --> 27:06.640]  Irie underscore genetics on Instagram.
[27:06.640 --> 27:08.840]  Find my cannabis photography and check me out.
[27:08.840 --> 27:10.940]  I also do Instagram live feeds
[27:10.940 --> 27:14.800]  where I go and answer cannabis questions live on the fly.
[27:14.800 --> 27:15.800]  I get super stoned.
[27:15.800 --> 27:17.120]  I hang out and take dabs
[27:17.120 --> 27:18.800]  and I talk with my friends on Instagram live.
[27:18.800 --> 27:20.720]  You can ask me questions and I will answer them
[27:20.720 --> 27:23.760]  right there live on the fly with no notes, no research.
[27:23.760 --> 27:24.940]  It's a lot of fun.
[27:24.940 --> 27:27.400]  It's kind of like quiz the grower and I kind of enjoy it.
[27:27.400 --> 27:30.320]  It keeps me on my toes and I actually pull some material
[27:30.320 --> 27:33.000]  from those feeds to use on the podcast.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.160]  So join me on the Instagram live videos.
[27:35.160 --> 27:36.360]  I would love your company.
[27:36.360 --> 27:38.320]  Come hang out, watch me take dabs,
[27:38.320 --> 27:40.880]  see what I'm smoking, see what's going on.
[27:40.880 --> 27:41.720]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[27:41.720 --> 27:43.160]  if you've got something you'd like to say,
[27:43.160 --> 27:44.880]  if you've got a product you'd like me to review,
[27:44.880 --> 27:46.640]  if you'd like to sponsor the podcast,
[27:46.640 --> 27:47.920]  if you'd just like to interact with me
[27:47.920 --> 27:49.400]  and you're not into all the social media,
[27:49.400 --> 27:50.520]  you can send me an email.
[27:51.320 --> 27:54.120]  It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[27:54.120 --> 27:55.320]  You know I love the emails.
[27:55.320 --> 27:56.960]  I love to interact with my audience.
[27:56.960 --> 27:58.280]  Thanks for all the support.
[27:58.280 --> 28:00.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, I feel like I'm rambling.
[28:00.160 --> 28:01.700]  I feel like my throat is burning out.
[28:01.700 --> 28:03.360]  I feel like this was a great episode.
[28:03.360 --> 28:05.020]  I want to thank you guys for hanging out.
[28:05.020 --> 28:06.720]  I'll be back Thursday with a quick episode.
[28:06.720 --> 28:08.680]  Of course, I'll be back Monday with a full length
[28:08.680 --> 28:10.520]  Grow From Your Heart podcast episode.
[28:10.520 --> 28:11.800]  Thanks again for listening.
[28:11.800 --> 28:14.280]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friends at VegBloom.
[28:14.280 --> 28:16.400]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[28:16.400 --> 28:17.960]  and give your mom a hug for me.
