[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  What's up, podcast world?
[00:01.720 --> 00:06.000]  It is time for episode 475 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.000 --> 00:09.280]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.280 --> 00:14.360]  If you need new regular, feminized, or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds
[00:14.360 --> 00:22.320]  Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:22.320 --> 00:25.680]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:26.160 --> 00:31.920]  I've been taking dabs of Garlic Banger Live Batter from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[00:31.920 --> 00:35.120]  This stuff is deliciously ridiculous.
[00:35.120 --> 00:40.000]  This is a blend of Headbanger and HSB, which is Han Solo Burger.
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.280]  On the package, the flavor is described as diesel and garlic, and that is absolutely
[00:45.280 --> 00:46.280]  accurate.
[00:46.280 --> 00:50.200]  I'm cracking open the jar now to give myself a fresh smell.
[00:50.200 --> 00:52.640]  This stuff smells, as soon as you open it, gas comes out.
[00:52.640 --> 00:55.080]  It is like, oh, did somebody open up the gas can?
[00:55.080 --> 00:58.380]  Then when you put your face a little closer to it, it is garlicky.
[00:58.380 --> 01:02.800]  It almost makes your eyes itchy, burny, and makes your nose go, what the fuck is that?
[01:02.800 --> 01:05.260]  It is garlic and gas at the same time.
[01:05.260 --> 01:08.400]  It is like you were eating Thanksgiving dinner at the gas station.
[01:08.400 --> 01:10.360]  That's what this makes me think of.
[01:10.360 --> 01:13.720]  Then when you dab it, that diesel flavor and aroma hits you right in the face.
[01:13.720 --> 01:15.680]  It's funky, gross.
[01:15.680 --> 01:19.480]  Then it's followed up by that garlicky, robust, savory flavor.
[01:19.480 --> 01:20.480]  It sits on your tongue.
[01:20.600 --> 01:22.720]  It gives you a really nice cotton mouth.
[01:22.720 --> 01:24.640]  Then the buzz just makes you want to chill out.
[01:24.640 --> 01:25.640]  It makes me nice and lazy.
[01:25.640 --> 01:28.640]  It kind of calms me down, which is something I can use.
[01:28.640 --> 01:31.240]  I tend to be going a little bit fast lately.
[01:31.240 --> 01:36.320]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Garlic Banger Live
[01:36.320 --> 01:37.840]  Batter.
[01:37.840 --> 01:42.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, I am going to read a couple of listener emails.
[01:42.040 --> 01:45.160]  Before I get to that part of the show, I would like to give some shout outs to a few of our
[01:45.160 --> 01:47.800]  friends from Patreon.
[01:47.800 --> 01:51.000]  Let's start off with a big Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out and a thank you
[01:51.000 --> 01:52.000]  to JM.
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.360]  I want to send a big thank you to Todd K.
[01:54.360 --> 01:58.160]  I want to send a big Giant Thank You fist bump to Blackbird76.
[01:58.160 --> 02:02.080]  How about a big Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to Zoso J.
[02:02.080 --> 02:04.120]  I want to send a giant thank you to Tommy.
[02:04.120 --> 02:07.520]  Of course, a giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to Keith K.
[02:07.520 --> 02:10.160]  I always want to send a giant shout out to WillysArmpit.
[02:10.160 --> 02:12.160]  Of course, a big shout out to Jacob W.
[02:12.160 --> 02:16.560]  And last but certainly not least, I'd like to send a Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast
[02:16.560 --> 02:20.320]  shout out and a thank you to our friend Isaac G.
[02:20.320 --> 02:24.240]  I want to thank each and every one of you for continuing to support the show on Patreon.
[02:24.240 --> 02:27.500]  I also want to thank everybody else out there who supports the show.
[02:27.500 --> 02:34.320]  If you would like to learn how to support the show, all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[02:34.320 --> 02:36.360]  slash growfromyourheart.
[02:36.360 --> 02:39.880]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:39.880 --> 02:43.800]  All right, in this episode, I do want to cover a couple of listener emails.
[02:43.800 --> 02:47.320]  I have got a large mountain of emails printed here in front of me.
[02:47.320 --> 02:50.040]  I am trying to work my way through the pile.
[02:50.040 --> 02:53.520]  If you have sent me an email and it has not made it to the show yet, please do not feel
[02:53.520 --> 02:54.520]  discouraged.
[02:54.520 --> 02:56.040]  I will get to your message.
[02:56.040 --> 02:59.280]  I honestly get about a hundred emails a day.
[02:59.280 --> 03:00.600]  I print out my favorites.
[03:00.600 --> 03:02.080]  I put them here in the pile.
[03:02.080 --> 03:06.060]  And then when it comes time to record, I just start at the top and work my way through.
[03:06.060 --> 03:10.880]  The email on the top of the pile today goes just like this.
[03:10.880 --> 03:12.280]  Rasta Jeff.
[03:12.280 --> 03:16.160]  First and foremost, I'd like to extend my gratitude for all of the time you invest in
[03:16.160 --> 03:18.400]  your podcast platform.
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.280]  I have listened to all but a few of your episodes and have to say that the amount of knowledge
[03:22.280 --> 03:27.100]  you have imparted on me is incredible and I want to extend my gratefulness.
[03:27.100 --> 03:28.100]  And this is a great message.
[03:28.100 --> 03:30.240]  I really like starting the show like this.
[03:30.240 --> 03:31.240]  You are very welcome.
[03:31.240 --> 03:32.240]  Thank you for listening.
[03:32.240 --> 03:37.340]  Thank you for learning and thank you for reaching out and expressing your gratefulness.
[03:37.340 --> 03:38.340]  So let's keep going.
[03:38.340 --> 03:40.020]  The message says, thank you.
[03:40.020 --> 03:42.460]  Your show definitely makes a difference.
[03:42.460 --> 03:43.900]  Keep up the hard work.
[03:43.900 --> 03:44.900]  I appreciate that.
[03:44.900 --> 03:48.100]  Not a lot of people realize that a podcast is hard work.
[03:48.100 --> 03:52.140]  People think I just turn on a microphone and ramble for 40 minutes and that's how it goes.
[03:52.140 --> 03:53.540]  Sometimes it's not that easy.
[03:53.540 --> 03:55.740]  Sometimes it is that easy, but there is prep that goes into it.
[03:55.740 --> 03:57.740]  I have to come up with an idea for a show.
[03:57.740 --> 03:59.060]  Then I have to actually do the show.
[03:59.060 --> 04:02.040]  Then there is editing and there is posting and there's a video and there's social media
[04:02.040 --> 04:03.340]  that goes along with it.
[04:03.340 --> 04:05.260]  So there is a lot of work that goes into a podcast.
[04:05.260 --> 04:08.380]  So thank you for noticing that part of the deal.
[04:08.380 --> 04:12.980]  It goes on to say, I do have a couple of questions for you if you have the time.
[04:12.980 --> 04:17.500]  Question number one, you mentioned that you will do an episode on your specific breakdown
[04:17.500 --> 04:20.100]  of your use of VegBloom nutrients.
[04:20.100 --> 04:24.900]  I would be very interested in this as I am currently using their full line.
[04:24.900 --> 04:29.420]  I'd like to see if there are some better alternatives as I know you were using a blend of their
[04:29.420 --> 04:30.420]  products.
[04:30.420 --> 04:31.940]  That is a very good question.
[04:31.940 --> 04:36.100]  I do still plan to deliver the nutrient mix episode.
[04:36.100 --> 04:38.060]  I am writing that episode.
[04:38.060 --> 04:40.460]  There are going to be a lot of details in that episode.
[04:40.460 --> 04:42.460]  People are going to ask a lot of questions.
[04:42.460 --> 04:46.580]  So I am taking my time to write that show down and have a lot of notes.
[04:46.580 --> 04:51.140]  In most cases, I make a very minimal outline so I can keep the show organic and feel like
[04:51.140 --> 04:52.900]  I'm having a conversation.
[04:52.900 --> 04:56.740]  The episode where I'm going to teach you about my nutrient mix will be quite detailed.
[04:56.740 --> 04:59.460]  So I am taking my time making that episode.
[04:59.460 --> 05:03.700]  I also was trying to get a couple of my friends to be on the show for that episode, but the
[05:03.700 --> 05:05.700]  timing for that is not going to work out.
[05:05.700 --> 05:10.020]  And now it is starting to snow here in Colorado, so getting people to come to Pueblo from Denver
[05:10.020 --> 05:12.680]  or Fort Collins is going to be challenging.
[05:12.680 --> 05:17.340]  So I am now writing that episode as a solo show and I do plan to bring it to you as soon
[05:17.340 --> 05:23.300]  as I feel like I have got the ingredients and the instructions and the timeline documented
[05:23.300 --> 05:24.300]  properly.
[05:24.300 --> 05:29.020]  I already know that the moment I drop that episode, I'm going to get an influx of emails
[05:29.020 --> 05:31.560]  asking for more details.
[05:31.560 --> 05:33.700]  People are going to have specific questions.
[05:33.700 --> 05:37.940]  I'm trying to cover all of those details and answer those questions before I put the
[05:37.940 --> 05:39.260]  episode out.
[05:39.260 --> 05:43.820]  If you listened to my last episode, you'll know that I am just trying to set myself up
[05:43.820 --> 05:44.820]  for success.
[05:44.820 --> 05:48.340]  That's a good example of setting yourself up for success.
[05:48.340 --> 05:49.340]  Now let's keep moving.
[05:49.340 --> 05:51.580]  There is a second question in this email.
[05:51.580 --> 05:54.400]  The second question goes just like this.
[05:54.400 --> 06:00.420]  I have a small assortment of some of your seeds that I acquired at the DGC 710 Cup.
[06:00.420 --> 06:05.540]  I have been hesitant to pop these until I can get some to keep in my genetic collection.
[06:05.540 --> 06:08.780]  I love that people collect my seeds like they are baseball cards.
[06:08.780 --> 06:11.560]  I really bred those seeds to be grown.
[06:11.560 --> 06:15.980]  But I really love that people have taken to collecting my seeds like they are baseball
[06:15.980 --> 06:17.900]  cards or Pokemon cards.
[06:17.900 --> 06:21.060]  I know people who have got the entire Irie Genetics collection.
[06:21.060 --> 06:26.180]  They have got seeds from when I was releasing Grateful Dog and Heart of Gold all the way
[06:26.180 --> 06:27.180]  up to the Lemon Jeffrey.
[06:27.180 --> 06:30.780]  They have got the Stomper line that most people never even knew about.
[06:30.780 --> 06:33.860]  And then of course a lot of people have all of the Arise line.
[06:33.860 --> 06:35.580]  But some people have everything.
[06:35.580 --> 06:38.840]  And some people send me a message with their list and they say, what am I missing?
[06:38.840 --> 06:40.580]  How can I fill in the gaps?
[06:40.580 --> 06:42.860]  And some people have stuff that I don't even have anymore.
[06:42.860 --> 06:44.980]  So I find that really impressive.
[06:44.980 --> 06:48.700]  But I think it's really neat that my supporters want to support me in such a way that they
[06:48.700 --> 06:52.140]  feel like they need to collect everything I release.
[06:52.140 --> 06:53.420]  That really means a lot to me.
[06:53.420 --> 06:58.900]  I have a lot of respect and appreciation for my supporters, my followers, my friends, my
[06:58.900 --> 07:00.140]  family, my fans.
[07:00.140 --> 07:01.820]  I call them the Irie Army.
[07:01.820 --> 07:05.620]  It really means a lot to me that you guys want to collect everything I put out.
[07:05.620 --> 07:09.980]  And trust me, I do realize that without you guys, I would not be able to do this.
[07:09.980 --> 07:11.900]  So big respect and big thank you.
[07:11.900 --> 07:12.900]  Let's keep going with this.
[07:12.900 --> 07:16.260]  It says, is there any way to source your gear locally?
[07:16.260 --> 07:20.460]  I live in Denver, but I am frequently in the Colorado Springs Pueblo area.
[07:20.460 --> 07:23.940]  So it would not be an issue for me to travel to any of those locations.
[07:23.940 --> 07:25.180]  All right.
[07:25.180 --> 07:26.220]  That is a great question.
[07:26.220 --> 07:30.220]  Our friend wants to grow out the Irie Genetics seeds he has already got.
[07:30.220 --> 07:33.620]  But once he does that, he is going to have a gap in his collection.
[07:33.620 --> 07:38.620]  So he wants to know if there is a local source for Irie Genetics seeds in the Denver, Colorado
[07:38.620 --> 07:40.720]  Springs Pueblo area.
[07:40.720 --> 07:47.660]  And unfortunately, my seeds are not available in any Colorado dispensaries at this time.
[07:47.660 --> 07:53.820]  That may change in the year 2020, but I do not want to make any promises or set any expectations.
[07:53.820 --> 08:01.620]  At this current time, the best way to acquire Irie Genetics seeds is through seedsherenow.com,
[08:01.620 --> 08:07.060]  dankseed.store, or oreganeliteseeds.com.
[08:07.060 --> 08:13.340]  However, if you are a Colorado local, or if you come to the Denver, Colorado Springs Pueblo
[08:13.340 --> 08:17.660]  area and you happen to bump into me, there is a good chance that I will have a lineup
[08:17.660 --> 08:19.980]  of Irie Genetics seeds with me.
[08:19.980 --> 08:25.020]  I also attend most of the large events in Colorado.
[08:25.020 --> 08:28.520]  So you have a good opportunity to bump into me at the IndoExpo.
[08:28.520 --> 08:30.420]  The IndoExpo is at the end of January.
[08:30.420 --> 08:35.780]  It is January 25th and 26th at the Denver Mart in Denver, Colorado.
[08:35.780 --> 08:38.160]  One of those days is business day.
[08:38.160 --> 08:40.340]  One of those days is open to the public.
[08:40.340 --> 08:45.220]  If you can attend the public day, I look forward to seeing you at the IndoExpo.
[08:45.220 --> 08:52.620]  At this time, I also plan to attend the Dude Grows Cup, which will be in April at Cultivated Synergy.
[08:52.620 --> 08:57.060]  That event has not been announced, booked, or scheduled, but most of the time we do that
[08:57.060 --> 09:05.340]  event the weekend before or after 420, and it is at Cultivated Synergy, and it is a consumption-friendly event.
[09:05.340 --> 09:07.020]  You will be able to dab with me.
[09:07.020 --> 09:09.720]  You will be able to smoke a fat joint with me.
[09:09.800 --> 09:12.640]  At the IndoExpo, there will be no consumption.
[09:12.640 --> 09:15.960]  So if you're coming from out of state and you're trying to meet up and take some dabs,
[09:15.960 --> 09:19.040]  the IndoExpo is a no-consumption event.
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.120]  The Dude Grows Cup, which has not been announced or confirmed yet, but it more than likely
[09:23.120 --> 09:25.600]  will happen because I'm kind of forcing it right now.
[09:25.600 --> 09:28.280]  I'm manifesting that it's going to happen.
[09:28.280 --> 09:30.560]  That is a consumption-friendly event.
[09:30.560 --> 09:31.560]  You can show up.
[09:31.560 --> 09:32.600]  We can take some dabs.
[09:32.600 --> 09:35.480]  We can smoke a joint, and we can spend some time together.
[09:35.480 --> 09:39.280]  So if you're in Colorado, if you're in the Denver, Colorado Springs, or Pueblo area,
[09:39.280 --> 09:41.520]  there is a good chance we could run into each other.
[09:41.520 --> 09:45.240]  If we don't run into each other organically or we don't set something up, I'm sure you
[09:45.240 --> 09:47.400]  can find me at the IndoExpo.
[09:47.400 --> 09:50.520]  They have not assigned me a booth number yet, but I'm sure I will be easy to find.
[09:50.520 --> 09:52.160]  It will be in all the advertising.
[09:52.160 --> 09:53.840]  My booth number will be on the guide.
[09:53.840 --> 09:55.800]  I've got a really large banner.
[09:55.800 --> 10:00.560]  And I'm also 6'5", and I've got dreadlocks to my ass, almost to my knees, so I should
[10:00.560 --> 10:02.720]  be pretty easy to identify.
[10:02.720 --> 10:04.540]  So find me at the IndoExpo.
[10:04.540 --> 10:09.240]  If you don't make it to the IndoExpo, find me at the Dude Grows Cup at Cultivated
[10:09.240 --> 10:13.680]  Synergy and you guys, I've said this before on previous episodes, if you see me at an
[10:13.680 --> 10:18.880]  event and you've always wanted to say hi, shake my hand, take a selfie, anything like
[10:18.880 --> 10:21.720]  that, anything that's not creepy and weird, I invite it.
[10:21.720 --> 10:23.160]  Come say hello.
[10:23.160 --> 10:25.880]  Don't tweet me tomorrow and say, hey, I saw you at the event.
[10:25.880 --> 10:27.280]  Looks like you were having fun.
[10:27.280 --> 10:28.280]  Come shake my hand.
[10:28.280 --> 10:30.840]  Say, hey, Rasta Jeff, I like listening to the show.
[10:30.840 --> 10:33.000]  Or hey, Rasta Jeff, I like growing your seeds.
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.360]  Come introduce yourself.
[10:34.360 --> 10:38.040]  If you have got some buds that you grew of my genetics, come show them to me.
[10:38.040 --> 10:40.320]  I would like to smell your buds.
[10:40.320 --> 10:42.880]  I want to see your work, especially if it's my genetics.
[10:42.880 --> 10:44.680]  I want to know what's happening in your grow.
[10:44.680 --> 10:45.680]  I want to be your friend.
[10:45.680 --> 10:46.760]  You listen to me ramble.
[10:46.760 --> 10:48.320]  It's my turn to listen to you.
[10:48.320 --> 10:49.720]  So come introduce yourself.
[10:49.720 --> 10:50.720]  Come shake my hand.
[10:50.720 --> 10:53.760]  I look forward to meeting everybody that listens to the show.
[10:53.760 --> 10:57.440]  And then if you're not in Colorado, if you're not able to come to the Denver area and meet
[10:57.440 --> 11:02.560]  me in person, again, I recommend seedsherenow.com.
[11:02.560 --> 11:06.160]  I also recommend dankseed.store.
[11:06.160 --> 11:10.360]  And of course, don't forget our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[11:10.360 --> 11:14.080]  Now the person that sent me this message was a Colorado local, so I look forward to hanging
[11:14.080 --> 11:18.280]  out and taking some dabs with you and talking about which seeds you want to sprout first
[11:18.280 --> 11:21.440]  to start growing some irigenetics in your garden.
[11:21.440 --> 11:24.760]  Now you didn't sign your name at the end of the email, but you did put the words local
[11:24.760 --> 11:27.040]  Colorado grower in the subject line.
[11:27.040 --> 11:32.200]  So big shout out, big thank you to local Colorado grower for the great email.
[11:32.200 --> 11:35.120]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, let's keep moving through this mountain
[11:35.120 --> 11:36.120]  of emails.
[11:36.120 --> 11:39.920]  The next email for this episode goes just like this.
[11:39.920 --> 11:43.960]  Hey, Rasta Jeff, big shout out to you and White Mike.
[11:43.960 --> 11:45.800]  Hey, Mike, you just got a shout out, bro.
[11:45.800 --> 11:48.980]  That means that it's time for you to come be on the show again.
[11:48.980 --> 11:52.380]  It goes on to say, I do love listening to you guys ramble.
[11:52.380 --> 11:56.240]  That is a good thing because when Mike comes on the show, we get a little bit stoned and
[11:56.240 --> 11:57.960]  we sure do ramble.
[11:57.960 --> 11:59.440]  So I'm glad you enjoy it.
[11:59.440 --> 12:03.700]  The message goes on to say, I have been a devoted listener to your podcast since hearing
[12:03.700 --> 12:08.500]  about it from the Dude Grows Show, and I am quickly making my way through all of the
[12:08.500 --> 12:09.500]  episodes.
[12:09.500 --> 12:11.580]  Well, I'm glad you have found me.
[12:11.580 --> 12:13.860]  I'm glad you found me through the Dude Grows Show.
[12:13.860 --> 12:16.380]  Of course, big shout out to my friends at the Dude Grows Show.
[12:16.380 --> 12:18.140]  Big shout out to the entire DGC.
[12:18.140 --> 12:19.500]  Thanks for all the support.
[12:19.500 --> 12:20.580]  Let's keep going with the email.
[12:20.580 --> 12:25.940]  It says, every episode teaches me something new or gives me some type of new perspective.
[12:25.940 --> 12:29.660]  So I truly appreciate all of the work that you put into them.
[12:29.660 --> 12:31.140]  Hey, that means a lot to me, man.
[12:31.140 --> 12:32.200]  Thank you.
[12:32.200 --> 12:35.920]  Knowing that I am sparking your brain to think in a different direction or maybe just making
[12:35.920 --> 12:38.200]  you look at the grow from another angle.
[12:38.200 --> 12:40.260]  That is kind of my goal because that is how we learn.
[12:40.260 --> 12:44.160]  If you keep looking at things straightforward, you're only going to see the straightforward
[12:44.160 --> 12:45.160]  view.
[12:45.160 --> 12:47.860]  If you take a step to the left, oh my God, look at all that other shit we can see from
[12:47.860 --> 12:48.860]  over here.
[12:48.860 --> 12:49.860]  Go take a step to the right.
[12:49.860 --> 12:53.000]  Oh my God, all kinds of new shit you can see over here.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.160]  I like knowing that you are learning something new from each episode, but it really means
[12:57.160 --> 13:00.860]  a lot to me to hear that I am giving you a new perspective.
[13:00.860 --> 13:02.380]  So thank you for telling me that.
[13:02.380 --> 13:04.180]  That is a huge compliment.
[13:04.180 --> 13:08.220]  And again, thank you for noticing all of the work that I do put into these episodes.
[13:08.220 --> 13:12.020]  We talked about that in the last message and it is a little bit of work.
[13:12.020 --> 13:15.440]  Let me keep going with this email because I am getting rambly.
[13:15.440 --> 13:19.860]  This email says, the first question I have doesn't really have to do anything with growing,
[13:19.860 --> 13:24.860]  but more about identifying and describing the seemingly limitless smells and flavors
[13:24.860 --> 13:27.660]  which come from the cannabis plants.
[13:27.660 --> 13:31.980]  Throughout Instagram and on your podcast, I often hear people describe buds as smelling
[13:31.980 --> 13:35.380]  cushy, hazy, or OG.
[13:35.380 --> 13:39.860]  Every time I try to ask someone what this exactly means, the person has a very hard
[13:39.860 --> 13:44.660]  time describing it to me in a way I can get a real feel for what I'm supposed to be looking
[13:44.660 --> 13:45.940]  for.
[13:45.940 --> 13:49.920]  That is a very good question because sometimes it can be challenging to try and describe
[13:49.920 --> 13:51.820]  some of these aromas and flavors.
[13:51.820 --> 13:53.400]  Some of them are very complex.
[13:53.400 --> 13:55.060]  Some are very obvious.
[13:55.060 --> 13:59.380]  Sometimes it is challenging to put your nose and a label on all of these different smells
[13:59.380 --> 14:02.580]  and aromas and all of this different information we are receiving.
[14:02.580 --> 14:06.720]  So let's spend a couple of minutes talking about some of the most common flavors and
[14:06.720 --> 14:11.300]  aromas people talk about when we are describing cannabis plants.
[14:11.300 --> 14:16.140]  Now the first one you asked about was cushy, but I want to start with diesel because diesel
[14:16.140 --> 14:18.940]  is going to help me describe a few more things.
[14:18.940 --> 14:24.660]  The reason the strain diesel is called diesel is because it smells like a barrel of diesel
[14:24.660 --> 14:25.660]  fuel.
[14:25.660 --> 14:30.540]  It has got a funky, sort of a stringent, sharp smell to it that kind of makes your nose,
[14:30.540 --> 14:32.580]  it makes my nose want to wrinkle up a little bit.
[14:32.580 --> 14:33.580]  I feel it in my eyes.
[14:33.580 --> 14:37.500]  It is a very chemically dominant kind of a smell.
[14:37.500 --> 14:38.940]  It smells like diesel fuel.
[14:38.940 --> 14:42.020]  There's nothing that smells like diesel fuel other than diesel fuel.
[14:42.020 --> 14:44.840]  That is why the strain diesel got that name.
[14:44.840 --> 14:50.040]  If you have got a bag of properly grown, real deal diesel in your pocket, you smell like
[14:50.040 --> 14:54.740]  somebody just poured diesel fuel in your pocket on your shoes.
[14:54.740 --> 14:57.920]  It is a very noticeable, pungent aroma.
[14:57.920 --> 15:02.360]  So I want to start this with that diesel fuel aroma because most of us know what that smells
[15:02.360 --> 15:03.360]  like.
[15:03.360 --> 15:04.360]  I think it smells warm.
[15:04.360 --> 15:05.920]  I think it smells like chemicals.
[15:05.920 --> 15:07.320]  I think it smells sharp.
[15:07.320 --> 15:11.580]  I feel like I can feel it in my nose and I feel like when I get too close to it, it makes
[15:11.580 --> 15:13.220]  me squint a little bit.
[15:13.220 --> 15:18.360]  There is also an underlying hint of skunk when it comes to the diesel strain.
[15:18.400 --> 15:21.200]  Think of diesel fuel and skunk.
[15:21.200 --> 15:24.900]  I'm going to try to build this flavor and this aroma in your mind.
[15:24.900 --> 15:28.320]  We have got diesel fuel with a little bit of a skunk background.
[15:28.320 --> 15:32.240]  Maybe somebody was putting fuel in the diesel truck and got sprayed by a skunk.
[15:32.240 --> 15:34.040]  That's kind of the aroma that we're working with.
[15:34.040 --> 15:35.380]  It is funky.
[15:35.380 --> 15:36.380]  It is gross.
[15:36.380 --> 15:42.320]  But for some reason, it is really delicious and really desirable when it comes to cannabis.
[15:42.320 --> 15:47.360]  So skunk and diesel are two great bases to start with, two very obvious aromas and two
[15:47.360 --> 15:50.480]  things that I think people should be familiar with.
[15:50.480 --> 15:53.280]  Now let's work our way toward kush.
[15:53.280 --> 15:56.040]  When we say kush, I'm talking about OG kush.
[15:56.040 --> 16:00.400]  You listed the flavor OG and you also listed the word kush as flavors.
[16:00.400 --> 16:04.000]  Those are sort of going to kind of fall into the same palette here.
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.440]  OG kush is a variety of kush, but it is the OG.
[16:07.440 --> 16:09.780]  It's the one we should kind of base the flavor on.
[16:09.780 --> 16:13.800]  Then everybody bred the kush to other things and it started to dilute the kush flavor.
[16:13.800 --> 16:17.040]  We wanted to add bananas and strawberries and oranges.
[16:17.040 --> 16:23.200]  We've got orange kush, banana kush, but let's focus on the original OG kush flavor.
[16:23.200 --> 16:27.720]  So I've built a nice idea of what the diesel and skunk aroma would kind of be like in your
[16:27.720 --> 16:28.720]  head.
[16:28.720 --> 16:32.640]  So let's kind of dial back the diesel aroma a little bit and let's add a little bit of
[16:32.640 --> 16:34.000]  pine to that.
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.120]  Maybe some fresh pine trees, maybe one of those pine tree air fresheners you put in
[16:38.120 --> 16:39.460]  the window of the car.
[16:39.460 --> 16:40.800]  Add some of that aroma to it.
[16:40.800 --> 16:42.560]  So we've got some skunk ass.
[16:42.560 --> 16:44.440]  We've got a little bit of diesel feel.
[16:44.440 --> 16:46.300]  Now we're putting pine on top of it.
[16:46.300 --> 16:50.660]  Now we're starting to get a little bit closer to that OG kush flavor.
[16:50.660 --> 16:56.360]  Now on top of that skunk ass, that diesel feel, and a little bit of pine, I also want
[16:56.360 --> 16:59.800]  to add just a hint of dirty feet.
[16:59.800 --> 17:01.920]  Just enough to make you go, what the fuck?
[17:01.920 --> 17:06.600]  And I know we've already got skunk and diesel in there, but that dirty rotten foot, just
[17:06.600 --> 17:10.860]  a little dirty rotten foot, really makes the rest of those aromas pop.
[17:10.860 --> 17:15.780]  I know that sounds disgusting, but that dirty foot aroma, it comes out, you got to smell
[17:15.780 --> 17:18.220]  it and then you smell it.
[17:18.220 --> 17:19.980]  It doesn't happen on the original smell.
[17:19.980 --> 17:22.460]  You go, ooh, diesel and skunk and pine.
[17:22.460 --> 17:24.220]  Oh, there's a foot in there.
[17:24.220 --> 17:25.220]  It hits you second.
[17:25.220 --> 17:29.100]  So we've got fuel and skunk, then we've put pine in there.
[17:29.100 --> 17:31.940]  Now we've put a little bit of a dirty foot in there.
[17:31.940 --> 17:36.460]  Now the next aromas I want to add are a little bit of dankness and maybe a little bit of
[17:36.460 --> 17:37.900]  swampiness.
[17:37.900 --> 17:41.700]  Think about if you go into a basement that's been sealed up for too long and it's kind
[17:41.700 --> 17:46.980]  of smells a little musty, a little damp, a little dank in there, that flavor kind of
[17:46.980 --> 17:49.420]  comes in at the end of the OG Kush.
[17:49.420 --> 17:54.380]  So it starts off skunky and fuely, and then it's got that pine dominance to it.
[17:54.380 --> 17:56.260]  Then there's a feet aroma to it.
[17:56.260 --> 18:00.280]  And then when it finishes, it is musty and funky and dank.
[18:00.280 --> 18:02.420]  Now I hope I have painted a good picture in your mind.
[18:02.420 --> 18:06.740]  I can almost taste some OG Kush right now from all these descriptors.
[18:06.820 --> 18:11.140]  Now there will be variations on this depending on which Kush you are smoking.
[18:11.140 --> 18:12.820]  Are you smoking OG Kush?
[18:12.820 --> 18:13.820]  You smoking Bubba Kush?
[18:13.820 --> 18:15.500]  Do you have Tahoe OG?
[18:15.500 --> 18:18.620]  There are a lot of different Kushes available.
[18:18.620 --> 18:23.700]  And unfortunately there are a lot of plants and jars of weed out there labeled Kush that
[18:23.700 --> 18:26.400]  do not have any Kush in the genetics.
[18:26.400 --> 18:32.700]  When the medical marijuana movement swept Colorado, I watched everybody go Kush crazy.
[18:32.700 --> 18:34.420]  I went to the dispensary on Friday.
[18:34.420 --> 18:35.800]  They had a big variety.
[18:35.860 --> 18:37.200]  It all smelled pretty decent.
[18:37.200 --> 18:38.800]  It all had neat names.
[18:38.800 --> 18:40.280]  Then Kush got popular.
[18:40.280 --> 18:43.560]  I went on Monday and everything had Kush at the end of the name.
[18:43.560 --> 18:46.720]  Orange Kush, Strawberry Kush, Blueberry Kush.
[18:46.720 --> 18:48.680]  None of that shit was called Kush last week.
[18:48.680 --> 18:49.800]  It just got popular.
[18:49.800 --> 18:51.900]  So everybody threw the name Kush at the end of it.
[18:51.900 --> 18:57.320]  And unfortunately that does work as a great sales tactic in the medical and recreational
[18:57.320 --> 18:58.800]  cannabis market.
[18:58.800 --> 19:04.600]  So when you're thinking about Kush, you should think fuel and skunk and pine and feet and
[19:04.600 --> 19:06.000]  dankness.
[19:06.000 --> 19:07.800]  Maybe a little bit of swampy smell.
[19:07.800 --> 19:11.680]  I kind of think it's got like a warm and savory smell.
[19:11.680 --> 19:17.760]  Some Kush varietals will have a chocolate or a coffee or maybe a dirt sort of a smell
[19:17.760 --> 19:18.760]  to it.
[19:18.760 --> 19:21.860]  Again, this depends on which Kush you were smoking.
[19:21.860 --> 19:27.000]  And also this will depend on how it was grown and dried and cured.
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.400]  Let's talk about some things that Kush is not.
[19:29.400 --> 19:31.800]  OG Kush is not sweet.
[19:31.800 --> 19:34.200]  OG Kush does not taste like candy.
[19:34.400 --> 19:37.200]  OG Kush does not taste like berries.
[19:37.200 --> 19:42.200]  If you were getting product that smells like berries or fruit, it is not real OG Kush.
[19:42.200 --> 19:45.280]  It is possibly some outcross of a Kush.
[19:45.280 --> 19:49.880]  You may have like maybe OG Kush to Jilly Bean will give you some orange flavored Kush.
[19:49.880 --> 19:52.560]  Maybe OG Kush to Blueberry would give you Blue Kush.
[19:52.560 --> 19:56.200]  But if it tastes too fruity, it is probably not Kush dominant.
[19:56.200 --> 20:05.880]  A good OG Kush is more on that gassy, fuel, chemicals, pine, dank, musty, skunky, swampy,
[20:05.880 --> 20:09.560]  chocolate, coffee, dirt sort of side of the aroma palette.
[20:09.560 --> 20:15.480]  It will be very easy to confuse the aromas of a good OG Kush with some of the Chemdog
[20:15.480 --> 20:17.200]  or Diesel varietals.
[20:17.200 --> 20:23.360]  But the main difference is going to be that darker pine, chocolate, coffee, swampy sort
[20:23.360 --> 20:24.360]  of a thing.
[20:24.560 --> 20:26.480]  Chemdog is going to have that chemical aroma.
[20:26.480 --> 20:30.440]  It's going to have the skunk in the feet, but it's going to be more on the, uh, like
[20:30.440 --> 20:33.600]  a fresh can of tennis balls or fresh tires.
[20:33.600 --> 20:35.600]  You're also going to have that aroma in there.
[20:35.600 --> 20:39.360]  So there's a little bit of a difference when it comes to the chems, the diesels and the
[20:39.360 --> 20:40.360]  Kushes.
[20:40.360 --> 20:44.200]  Unfortunately, the only real way to smell something is to smell something.
[20:44.200 --> 20:49.880]  So I recommend coming to Colorado, heading to a legal state and going to a reputable
[20:49.880 --> 20:55.000]  dispensary and smelling some good Kush and smelling some good Hayes and smelling some
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.320]  good whatever else is available so that you can kind of get a nice idea of what the different
[20:59.320 --> 21:01.440]  options are and what different things smell like.
[21:01.440 --> 21:05.360]  So I think it's time for you to start planning a road trip.
[21:05.360 --> 21:07.120]  This listener does ask a few more questions.
[21:07.120 --> 21:08.120]  They ask about Hayes.
[21:08.120 --> 21:11.000]  How do we describe the flavor of Hayes?
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.640]  That is a very unique flavor.
[21:12.640 --> 21:15.520]  I describe Hayes as a sandalwood flavor.
[21:15.520 --> 21:17.520]  It's got a woody flavor.
[21:17.520 --> 21:21.360]  Sometimes I think Hayes smells a little bit like a gentle incense.
[21:21.360 --> 21:25.040]  It also sometimes has a bit of a spicy flavor to it.
[21:25.040 --> 21:28.720]  Sometimes I describe Hayes as a green apple sort of a flavor.
[21:28.720 --> 21:34.400]  So it's sandalwood, it's incense, it's a little bit spicy and it's got a green apple flavor.
[21:34.400 --> 21:39.400]  It's harder for me to describe the flavor of a Hayes because a Hayes is not as common.
[21:39.400 --> 21:45.760]  A true Hayes plant is going to take at least 11 or 12, probably 14 weeks if you're smoking
[21:45.800 --> 21:47.720]  the true Hayes.
[21:47.720 --> 21:51.660]  So it's going to be very unlikely that you run into a true Hayes plant.
[21:51.660 --> 21:55.880]  You may find some Hayes crosses just like I was talking about the OG Kush, but a pure
[21:55.880 --> 21:59.260]  Hayes is going to be very unlikely.
[21:59.260 --> 22:03.960]  Things you can look for in a Hayes flavor like I mentioned earlier are that woody flavor,
[22:03.960 --> 22:05.820]  sort of a sandalwood flavor.
[22:05.820 --> 22:09.920]  Some Hayeses have a spicy green apple type of a flavor to them.
[22:09.920 --> 22:14.020]  Some of them have got a sweet perfumey sort of aroma to them.
[22:14.320 --> 22:18.260]  Most of the Hayeses I have experienced have been a hybrid that were crossed with something
[22:18.260 --> 22:22.860]  else to reduce flowering time because like I mentioned earlier, a good Hayes takes too
[22:22.860 --> 22:24.100]  damn long to flower.
[22:24.100 --> 22:28.780]  So it's very unlikely that you're going to find a pure Hayes unless you or one of your
[22:28.780 --> 22:31.900]  very close friends are growing it for yourselves.
[22:31.900 --> 22:36.060]  So I know my description of the flavor of Hayes was not as nearly in depth as my flavor
[22:36.060 --> 22:40.860]  description of OG, but that tells you how much Hayes I have been exposed to and how
[22:40.860 --> 22:43.580]  much OG Kush I have been exposed to.
[22:43.580 --> 22:48.660]  Like I said a moment ago in Colorado, when the medical marijuana market took off, everybody
[22:48.660 --> 22:50.340]  went Kush crazy.
[22:50.340 --> 22:54.580]  Since Hayes takes so long to grow, you don't see it here in the commercial market.
[22:54.580 --> 23:00.620]  The legal cannabis cultivation market in Colorado is already trying to find ways to pinch every
[23:00.620 --> 23:02.880]  penny and save every dollar.
[23:02.880 --> 23:08.420]  So growing a 12 to 14 week cultivar is really not an option in a commercial cultivation
[23:08.420 --> 23:09.420]  facility.
[23:09.420 --> 23:10.420]  All right.
[23:10.420 --> 23:11.420]  There is more to this message.
[23:11.420 --> 23:16.060]  Being a relatively youngish grower, I started smoking cannabis right after college and then
[23:16.060 --> 23:18.060]  began growing a few years back.
[23:18.060 --> 23:22.040]  I am unfamiliar with what these strains are supposed to smell like.
[23:22.040 --> 23:26.100]  I feel like this question is great for you because you do a very good job at describing
[23:26.100 --> 23:30.620]  smells and flavors and seem to have a real gift for doing so.
[23:30.620 --> 23:31.620]  Hey, thank you for that.
[23:31.620 --> 23:33.380]  I hope I did a good job.
[23:33.380 --> 23:38.020]  I apologize that I did not have a thoroughly detailed description on Hayes, but I think
[23:38.020 --> 23:41.380]  I made up for it with my great description on the Kush.
[23:41.380 --> 23:42.940]  So there is still more to this email.
[23:42.940 --> 23:47.180]  The last paragraph says, my other question is, when should I expect to see fading in
[23:47.180 --> 23:49.860]  my plants for an organic grow?
[23:49.860 --> 23:54.020]  I'm worried that the beginning of fade I see earlier on in flower, and then he says weeks
[23:54.020 --> 24:00.820]  four and five is a nutrient deficiency I should deal with rather than an actual proper fade.
[24:00.820 --> 24:03.660]  Then he wraps the email up with, thanks again for everything you do.
[24:03.660 --> 24:08.120]  I will continue to support you via Patreon and I will continue to look forward to every
[24:08.120 --> 24:11.320]  new episode you roll out best.
[24:11.320 --> 24:12.400]  And then they sign their name.
[24:12.400 --> 24:14.160]  I don't know if you want your name set on the show.
[24:14.160 --> 24:16.600]  So big thank you for the great email.
[24:16.600 --> 24:19.160]  Let's talk about this fading question.
[24:19.160 --> 24:24.300]  The question is, when should I expect to see fading in my plants in an organic grow?
[24:24.300 --> 24:28.480]  Because this listener is worried that the fade is beginning too early.
[24:28.480 --> 24:32.720]  This listener has plants that are in weeks four or five and they are showing a fade and
[24:32.720 --> 24:35.640]  they are in fear that it is a nutrient deficiency.
[24:35.640 --> 24:38.680]  Yes, that is probably a nutrient deficiency.
[24:38.680 --> 24:40.960]  Let's talk about what the fade is.
[24:40.960 --> 24:45.600]  Toward the end of the flowering phase, we like to flush our plants, which means we are
[24:45.600 --> 24:50.700]  removing all of the built up nutrients from the soil, the soilless mix or whatever you've
[24:50.700 --> 24:52.280]  got in your container.
[24:52.280 --> 24:56.600]  We're just feeding water for 10 to 14 days to rinse out that container.
[24:56.600 --> 24:58.360]  So the plants don't have anything to eat.
[24:58.360 --> 25:01.200]  And then they essentially begin to cannibalize themselves.
[25:01.200 --> 25:05.280]  They will use their stored nutrients, which are stored within the plant cells.
[25:05.280 --> 25:06.600]  They will start sucking that up.
[25:06.600 --> 25:07.600]  That's all of their life.
[25:07.600 --> 25:09.800]  They're basically working off that fat belly.
[25:09.800 --> 25:11.720]  Then once they don't have a fat belly, they're starving.
[25:11.720 --> 25:14.160]  They begin looking a little bit yellow.
[25:14.160 --> 25:18.320]  That is exactly what we want at the last part of the flowering phase.
[25:18.320 --> 25:22.440]  Flushing the plants, cleaning out all of those nutrients will make that final dried and cured
[25:22.440 --> 25:24.840]  bud taste delicious.
[25:24.840 --> 25:27.640]  So later in flower, we look to see what we call the fade.
[25:27.640 --> 25:32.760]  We just want to watch those leaves slowly turn from robust, lush green leaves to kind
[25:32.760 --> 25:34.560]  of faded out yellow leaves.
[25:34.840 --> 25:36.920]  Some cultivars will get really unique colors.
[25:36.920 --> 25:39.400]  You'll see some purples and oranges and yellows.
[25:39.400 --> 25:43.240]  You'll see a nice fall display come out of your grow room.
[25:43.240 --> 25:46.120]  Our friend here has this happening way too early.
[25:46.120 --> 25:51.440]  It is happening in weeks four and five, which means we have got a nutrient deficiency.
[25:51.440 --> 25:56.440]  Without more info, without some pictures or some details, I cannot identify the deficiency.
[25:56.440 --> 26:00.880]  But if you were at week four or five in an organic grow and you were seeing yellowing,
[26:00.880 --> 26:03.500]  you were going to be struggling until the end of this grow.
[26:03.500 --> 26:05.860]  You were doing what is called chasing the plant.
[26:05.860 --> 26:09.940]  You are never going to catch up with that plant's appetite for nutrients.
[26:09.940 --> 26:11.860]  You did state that the grow is organic.
[26:11.860 --> 26:15.780]  I don't know if you're using a super soil or some sort of amended soil or if you were
[26:15.780 --> 26:21.900]  feeding teas or maybe even organic bottled nutrients, but you do need to increase your
[26:21.900 --> 26:22.900]  feedings.
[26:22.900 --> 26:25.940]  I may recommend some type of a foliar feed.
[26:25.940 --> 26:31.900]  One thing I will really suggest is don't try to correct this issue by radically increasing
[26:32.020 --> 26:33.020]  your feeds.
[26:33.020 --> 26:38.460]  A major increase in feed is only going to cause more problems.
[26:38.460 --> 26:41.620]  I would carefully diagnose the issue with the plant.
[26:41.620 --> 26:43.820]  What do you feel like the plant is deficient in?
[26:43.820 --> 26:45.900]  Is it showing a nitrogen deficiency?
[26:45.900 --> 26:48.080]  Is it phosphorus or potassium deficient?
[26:48.080 --> 26:49.660]  Does it need CalMag?
[26:49.660 --> 26:54.780]  Let's correctly identify the deficiency, then let's use the appropriate amendment to fix
[26:54.780 --> 26:55.780]  that deficiency.
[26:55.780 --> 27:00.460]  I don't know, again, if you're using super soil or teas or an amended soil.
[27:00.460 --> 27:03.820]  I don't know what you're using, so I don't know what the solution will be.
[27:03.820 --> 27:08.940]  When you're using organics, many of those products will take several days, if not several
[27:08.940 --> 27:14.260]  weeks, to break down and become bioavailable for that plant to uptake to help solving your
[27:14.260 --> 27:15.420]  problem.
[27:15.420 --> 27:17.460]  That's why I recommend a foliar feed.
[27:17.460 --> 27:22.140]  You may be able to help this plant out by directly spraying these nutrients onto the
[27:22.140 --> 27:23.140]  plant.
[27:23.140 --> 27:25.020]  Don't spray undiluted nutrients onto the plant.
[27:25.020 --> 27:29.900]  If you're going to foliar feed, mix up the appropriate nutrient, dilute it very, very
[27:29.900 --> 27:30.900]  light.
[27:30.900 --> 27:33.900]  We don't need strong nutrients directly applied to the plants.
[27:33.900 --> 27:35.580]  Very low ratios.
[27:35.580 --> 27:39.780]  Then spray that onto the plant, and then watch the plant recover over a few days.
[27:39.780 --> 27:43.160]  Do not go in there and think, my plant is nitrogen deficient.
[27:43.160 --> 27:46.920]  I'm going to feed the fuck out of it with a bunch of nitrogen and fix this problem.
[27:46.920 --> 27:48.220]  That will not work.
[27:48.220 --> 27:52.740]  We need to increase the nitrogen a little bit, and then feed it frequently, and pay
[27:52.740 --> 27:53.740]  attention.
[27:53.740 --> 27:57.940]  Unfortunately, you probably will not be able to catch up to this plant.
[27:57.940 --> 28:01.220]  Those leaves that look like shit will always look like shit.
[28:01.220 --> 28:03.700]  If they are really terrible, pull them right off.
[28:03.700 --> 28:05.380]  They don't have to stay there.
[28:05.380 --> 28:08.540]  Just make sure that the new growth is healthy.
[28:08.540 --> 28:13.460]  So carefully identify the deficiency, then let's increase that nutrient.
[28:13.460 --> 28:16.700]  I'm not sure how you're going to deliver that nutrient to the plant because I don't know
[28:16.700 --> 28:21.620]  your style of grow, but it definitely sounds like you are fading too early because you
[28:21.620 --> 28:23.400]  have got a deficiency.
[28:23.400 --> 28:28.200]  If you did use a super soil or an amended soil, it needs to be a little richer next
[28:28.200 --> 28:30.800]  time, or you need to veg for less time.
[28:30.800 --> 28:34.840]  Again, I know I keep saying this, but without seeing your plants and without a little more
[28:34.840 --> 28:39.040]  information, it's hard for me to diagnose exactly what you are deficient in, but it
[28:39.040 --> 28:43.880]  does sound like you are experiencing a nutrient deficiency in your garden.
[28:43.880 --> 28:47.760]  Now before somebody out there starts typing an email, let me address what I just said.
[28:47.760 --> 28:52.400]  I did recommend foliar feeding these plants that are in flower.
[28:52.400 --> 28:55.360]  Because they are nutrient deficient, they are going to struggle all the way through
[28:55.360 --> 28:57.600]  their life if we don't take action.
[28:57.600 --> 28:59.800]  We are four or five weeks into flower.
[28:59.800 --> 29:05.000]  I am assuming these buds are not giant and chunky because they are nutrient deficient.
[29:05.000 --> 29:11.200]  I think one or two foliar feeds at the right time will rescue these plants and not cause
[29:11.200 --> 29:13.840]  too much risk of causing a problem to the buds.
[29:13.840 --> 29:18.320]  We won't get any bud mold because there's not bud there, and we're not spraying a pesticide,
[29:18.320 --> 29:21.540]  so it is not going to contaminate our final product.
[29:21.540 --> 29:25.380]  So if you're typing an email because I just told somebody to foliar feed in week four
[29:25.380 --> 29:27.780]  or five, just hit cancel.
[29:27.780 --> 29:29.460]  It's going to be okay.
[29:29.460 --> 29:33.940]  As long as those buds aren't giant and chunky, and as long as we're not applying a pesticide,
[29:33.940 --> 29:37.940]  and as long as we don't completely soak those plants like a giant sponge and then close
[29:37.940 --> 29:42.660]  the room up and let it get stagnant, I think that this will be a good idea to foliar feed
[29:42.660 --> 29:46.140]  those plants with the correct nutrients.
[29:46.140 --> 29:51.460]  Now I will assume that you want to keep your garden as organic as possible, but think about
[29:51.580 --> 29:52.580]  this.
[29:52.580 --> 29:56.540]  Many of the organics will take time to become bioavailable to your plant.
[29:56.540 --> 29:59.060]  Your plant is already struggling.
[29:59.060 --> 30:06.020]  Salt-based bottled nutrients are much more bioavailable to your plant and will be uptaken
[30:06.020 --> 30:11.340]  by the plant almost immediately upon that nutrient finding a root.
[30:11.340 --> 30:17.340]  You will have much more success and much more chance of rescuing this plant if you bite
[30:17.340 --> 30:23.780]  the bullet and use a non-organic bottled nutrient to attack your problem.
[30:23.780 --> 30:28.940]  If you want to stay organic, disregard that advice, but if you really want to rescue these
[30:28.940 --> 30:35.580]  plants, it may be time to think about switching it up and adding a non-organic ingredient
[30:35.580 --> 30:36.580]  to your grow.
[30:36.580 --> 30:41.620]  Again, if that's not something you're interested in doing, totally disregard this section,
[30:41.620 --> 30:44.780]  but it may be your best option at this time.
[30:45.260 --> 30:49.420]  I do really hope you were able to rescue this crop and I want to thank you for the great
[30:49.420 --> 30:50.420]  email.
[30:50.420 --> 30:53.340]  This was sent a while back, so it is time for an update.
