[00:00.700 --> 00:04.700]  This episode of the podcast is dedicated to Kevin Perkins, Sr.
[00:04.700 --> 00:05.700]  Also known as Pops.
[00:05.700 --> 00:10.700]  Pops was little Kev's dad, but he hung out like he was all of our bro.
[00:10.700 --> 00:11.700]  He wasn't Kev's dad.
[00:11.700 --> 00:13.700]  He was everybody's best friend.
[00:13.700 --> 00:18.700]  Unfortunately, cancer took him, and I'm going to miss him.
[00:18.700 --> 00:20.700]  Pops was a bad motherfucker.
[00:20.700 --> 00:22.700]  Pops told some really cool stories.
[00:22.700 --> 00:27.700]  Pops told some fucking questionable stories that were amazing and fantastical
[00:27.700 --> 00:29.700]  that you'd say, did that shit really happen?
[00:29.700 --> 00:33.700]  But then one day you'd be hanging out with Pops and his brother, and his brother would say,
[00:33.700 --> 00:36.700]  hey, Pops, remember that time we did this amazing shit?
[00:36.700 --> 00:40.700]  And you'd say, holy shit, all those stories Pops told are fucking real.
[00:40.700 --> 00:47.700]  He was one of those old guys that done it all, been there, done that, and has fucking conquered.
[00:47.700 --> 00:49.700]  And he was just cool to fucking hang out with.
[00:49.700 --> 00:50.700]  He was a cool dude.
[00:50.700 --> 00:51.700]  He told great stories.
[00:51.700 --> 00:54.700]  I could listen to Pops tell a story any day of the fucking week.
[00:54.700 --> 00:58.700]  I always had time to hear a Pops story, and Pops always had a fucking story for you.
[00:59.700 --> 01:02.700]  Ah, I hate to cry on my own podcast.
[01:02.700 --> 01:08.700]  I hate to cry on any podcast, I guess, but Pops, you've always treated me with love and respect.
[01:08.700 --> 01:12.700]  You were a cantankerous, ornery motherfucker, and I loved you for it.
[01:14.700 --> 01:16.700]  I'm truly going to miss you, brother.
[01:16.700 --> 01:18.700]  I'm going to miss your stories.
[01:18.700 --> 01:22.700]  I'm going to miss dabbing with you, and I'll miss your friendship.
[01:25.290 --> 01:27.290]  This episode is for Pops.
[01:28.290 --> 01:43.600]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:43.600 --> 01:47.600]  It's time for episode number 285 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:47.600 --> 01:50.600]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:50.600 --> 01:55.600]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker, or a dedicated dabber,
[01:55.600 --> 02:00.600]  if you're a cannabis activist, or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[02:00.600 --> 02:02.600]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[02:02.600 --> 02:05.600]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[02:05.600 --> 02:07.600]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[02:07.600 --> 02:13.600]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[02:13.600 --> 02:17.600]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[02:19.600 --> 02:25.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am dabbing some concentrates today that I don't even know the name of the flavor.
[02:25.600 --> 02:30.600]  I don't know the name of the extract artist, but I know that it is delicious.
[02:30.600 --> 02:34.600]  This is a gift to me from a friend at the Indo Expo in Denver.
[02:35.600 --> 02:41.600]  I was standing in line, somebody walked up and was like, Rasta Jeff, I made something, I want to bless you with this sample.
[02:41.600 --> 02:45.600]  Me and my girl grew this in our garden and processed it ourselves.
[02:45.600 --> 02:47.600]  And man, this stuff is delicious.
[02:47.600 --> 02:50.600]  I just opened the jar, there's like two dabs left in here.
[02:50.600 --> 02:56.600]  It smells gassy, it smells fruity at the same time, there's an undertone of a hidden fruit.
[02:56.600 --> 03:01.600]  But I've been dabbing on this, and it is delicious.
[03:01.600 --> 03:03.600]  And great job, man, thank you.
[03:03.600 --> 03:09.600]  I've got some apothecary dabs sitting here, I've got some viola extract sitting here, I've got some CSC concentrates.
[03:09.600 --> 03:12.600]  And this has been my go-to dab, it's almost gone.
[03:12.600 --> 03:16.600]  I wanted to save some for this part of the podcast so that I could describe it.
[03:16.600 --> 03:19.600]  These crystals are beautiful.
[03:19.600 --> 03:25.600]  The structure on this, the flavor on this, the amount of terps to crystals was beautiful.
[03:25.600 --> 03:27.600]  I was totally satisfied and impressed.
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.600]  I feel like an asshole because I cannot recall the dude's name, because I was trying to check into the event,
[03:32.600 --> 03:37.600]  I was meeting a bunch of people all at once, and this dude showed up with some amazing concentrates.
[03:37.600 --> 03:39.600]  Man, thank you.
[03:39.600 --> 03:44.600]  If you're listening to the podcast, please send me a message, either on Instagram or Twitter or email me,
[03:44.600 --> 03:51.600]  and let me know what your name is so I can give you an appropriate shoutout, because your concentrates are phenomenal.
[03:51.600 --> 03:53.600]  Thanks a lot, I appreciate the sample and the gift.
[03:53.600 --> 03:55.600]  Thank you, good work, dude, good work.
[03:55.600 --> 03:57.600]  All right, welcome to the show, everybody.
[03:57.600 --> 03:58.600]  I'm obviously lit.
[03:58.600 --> 04:02.600]  I just did a nice Instagram live video where I smoked some of these dabs I was just talking about.
[04:02.600 --> 04:08.600]  I smoked some Extreme Oranges High Cannabinoid Full Spectrum Extract, had some Gorilla Glue batter,
[04:08.600 --> 04:10.600]  and quite a few dabs in that Instagram live video.
[04:10.600 --> 04:11.600]  Got to hang out with some friends.
[04:11.600 --> 04:13.600]  Shoutout to everybody that was in there.
[04:13.600 --> 04:15.600]  If you're not following me on Instagram, check that out.
[04:15.600 --> 04:19.600]  Go to Instagram and follow me, it's irie__genetics on Instagram.
[04:19.600 --> 04:21.600]  You can be a part of the live videos that I do.
[04:21.600 --> 04:24.600]  People ask questions, I answer questions about their gardens, try to give them advice,
[04:24.600 --> 04:26.600]  also just hang out and bullshit.
[04:26.600 --> 04:28.600]  It's a good way to hang out and get a little bit more content.
[04:29.600 --> 04:31.600]  All right, I've got several cool things to talk about.
[04:31.600 --> 04:34.600]  Before I get too far, let's talk about Patreon.
[04:34.600 --> 04:38.600]  I've done some changes to my Patreon page, my Patreon campaign.
[04:38.600 --> 04:41.600]  I will do more updating as time goes on here over the next few days.
[04:41.600 --> 04:43.600]  I'm just thinking about how I want to do it.
[04:43.600 --> 04:45.600]  I've realized something.
[04:45.600 --> 04:50.600]  On my Patreon page, it says if you contribute a certain amount of funding,
[04:50.600 --> 04:53.600]  that I will answer your email on the next episode.
[04:53.600 --> 04:56.600]  Then I realized that several people contributed that amount,
[04:56.600 --> 04:59.600]  and I may or may not have answered your email,
[04:59.600 --> 05:03.600]  because there's not a simple way for me to tell on some of them.
[05:03.600 --> 05:07.600]  If your name on Patreon doesn't match your email name, and I didn't catch on to that,
[05:07.600 --> 05:10.600]  if somebody didn't point it out to me, I may not have noticed.
[05:10.600 --> 05:15.600]  So, if you contributed to Patreon, and you feel that I owe you an email answer,
[05:15.600 --> 05:18.600]  please send me an email right now.
[05:18.600 --> 05:21.600]  Send the email to growfromyourheartathotmail.com and say,
[05:21.600 --> 05:24.600]  Hey bro, I contributed to the Patreon campaign,
[05:24.600 --> 05:27.600]  and you were supposed to answer my email, and you never did,
[05:27.600 --> 05:28.600]  and I will get on that.
[05:28.600 --> 05:32.600]  I did not realize that I may have missed one or two of those, or maybe even more.
[05:32.600 --> 05:35.600]  So, if I missed you, and you contributed, I apologize.
[05:35.600 --> 05:36.600]  I owe you.
[05:36.600 --> 05:40.600]  So, send me an email, and I will get on that immediately.
[05:40.600 --> 05:44.600]  And once again, if you did contribute, and I didn't read your email, I apologize.
[05:44.600 --> 05:45.600]  I do feel like a jerk for that.
[05:45.600 --> 05:49.600]  So, message me, and I will make it up to you right away.
[05:49.600 --> 05:52.600]  Also, I'm going to continue to adjust the Patreon campaigns.
[05:52.600 --> 05:56.600]  I'd like to have somewhere between three and five different options available
[05:56.600 --> 05:57.600]  for the Patreon contributors.
[05:57.600 --> 06:02.600]  So, that will continue to evolve as will the podcast over time.
[06:02.600 --> 06:05.600]  So, thanks to everybody who has contributed to Patreon,
[06:05.600 --> 06:07.600]  and everybody who will contribute to Patreon.
[06:07.600 --> 06:10.600]  I appreciate the support, and it's perfect timing,
[06:10.600 --> 06:14.600]  because my MacBook is starting to slow down, and sometimes it kind of worries me.
[06:14.600 --> 06:17.600]  So, hopefully within the next year, we can replace this thing
[06:17.600 --> 06:22.600]  with one of those new MacBook Pros that's a little snazzier and a little faster.
[06:22.600 --> 06:24.600]  Then I would just use this one for uploading YouTube videos.
[06:24.600 --> 06:26.600]  That might speed that process up.
[06:26.600 --> 06:30.600]  Anyway, big shout out to everybody who has helped me out on Patreon.
[06:30.600 --> 06:31.600]  I do appreciate it.
[06:31.600 --> 06:34.600]  Make sure you check out patreon.com slash GrowFromYourHeart
[06:34.600 --> 06:39.600]  if you are interested in contributing to the Patreon campaign.
[06:39.600 --> 06:40.600]  All right, enough about Patreon.
[06:40.600 --> 06:44.600]  Let's talk about more interesting cannabis-related stuff.
[06:44.600 --> 06:45.600]  Let's talk about my breeding project.
[06:45.600 --> 06:48.600]  I've been keeping you guys updated on some of my breeding projects.
[06:48.600 --> 06:53.600]  I have got two different projects that are about 30-ish days apart.
[06:53.600 --> 06:55.600]  The main one is finished.
[06:55.600 --> 07:01.600]  I think that when I am done recording, I can start cutting down some of these plants.
[07:01.600 --> 07:05.600]  That breeding project is, of course, the Durban Poison female
[07:05.600 --> 07:08.600]  and the Stardog female cross to Arise.
[07:08.600 --> 07:11.600]  There's Durban Poison, Stardog, Platinum Tangy,
[07:11.600 --> 07:14.600]  and a couple other select females in that grow.
[07:14.600 --> 07:16.600]  They have been pollinated by Arise.
[07:16.600 --> 07:20.600]  They have been in there for about 65 days now.
[07:20.600 --> 07:23.600]  It is time to start cutting down some of those plants
[07:23.600 --> 07:26.600]  and separating them and getting them into small pieces
[07:26.600 --> 07:28.600]  and letting them dry up and then getting the seeds out of them.
[07:28.600 --> 07:30.600]  They are ready.
[07:30.600 --> 07:33.600]  There will be Durban Poison to Arise and Stardog to Arise
[07:33.600 --> 07:38.600]  and Platinum Tangy to Arise testers very soon once those get tested.
[07:38.600 --> 07:39.600]  We'll see what they do.
[07:39.600 --> 07:41.600]  We'll find out if we want to make them available.
[07:41.600 --> 07:43.600]  We'll find out if we want to make F2s.
[07:43.600 --> 07:46.600]  We'll find out if we want to abandon the project altogether.
[07:46.600 --> 07:48.600]  But the seeds are just about done.
[07:48.600 --> 07:50.600]  It's time to start taking down some of those plants,
[07:50.600 --> 07:52.600]  letting the plants dry, get the seeds out,
[07:52.600 --> 07:56.600]  and then we can test them and decide the future on those.
[07:56.600 --> 08:01.600]  Also, I've been working on a Blueberry Cookies feminize seed.
[08:01.600 --> 08:03.600]  I have reversed a Blueberry Cookies plant
[08:03.600 --> 08:06.600]  and I have pollinated another Blueberry Cookies.
[08:06.600 --> 08:09.600]  I also pollinated the Platinum Tangy, the Strawberry Fields,
[08:09.600 --> 08:11.600]  and there are a couple others in there.
[08:11.600 --> 08:13.600]  I'm not sure if I need to mention all of them.
[08:13.600 --> 08:15.600]  But those are about 35 days in.
[08:15.600 --> 08:17.600]  They just received pollen a few days ago.
[08:17.600 --> 08:20.600]  Everything is looking like it took the pollen well.
[08:20.600 --> 08:23.600]  The pistils changed colors very quickly this time.
[08:23.600 --> 08:25.600]  The plants look really healthy.
[08:25.600 --> 08:27.600]  Everything looks really happy.
[08:27.600 --> 08:31.600]  I think that crop needs about 25 to 35 more days.
[08:31.600 --> 08:33.600]  Those plants will be ready to cut down.
[08:33.600 --> 08:36.600]  We can let them dry once again, chop them up into small pieces,
[08:36.600 --> 08:39.600]  get the seeds out of them, and then I will grow those
[08:39.600 --> 08:41.600]  and see what I have created.
[08:41.600 --> 08:43.600]  And then if I like it, I'll make more.
[08:43.600 --> 08:47.600]  If I don't like it, we, of course, abandon the project and try something new.
[08:47.600 --> 08:50.600]  So those are updates on my two most recent breeding projects.
[08:50.600 --> 08:54.600]  We've got the Durban Poison to Arise, Stardog to Arise,
[08:54.600 --> 08:56.600]  Platinum Tangy to Arise.
[08:56.600 --> 08:58.600]  There might be other surprises in that room also.
[08:58.600 --> 09:02.600]  And then we have also got Blueberry Cookies
[09:02.600 --> 09:05.600]  to Blueberry Cookies itself to make fem seeds,
[09:05.600 --> 09:07.600]  Blueberry Cookies S1s,
[09:07.600 --> 09:09.600]  and also Blueberry Cookies to Platinum Tangy
[09:09.600 --> 09:11.600]  and Blueberry Cookies to Strawberry Fields.
[09:11.600 --> 09:13.600]  There are others in there.
[09:13.600 --> 09:15.600]  We'll talk about those in the future.
[09:15.600 --> 09:17.600]  But those are the two breeding projects that I'm excited about right now.
[09:17.600 --> 09:21.600]  In the future, of course, I am going to make more of the Lemon Jeffrey.
[09:21.600 --> 09:23.600]  The Lemon Jeffrey is Lemon Skunk to Golden Goat.
[09:23.600 --> 09:27.600]  And while I'm doing that, I plan to make more Golden Goat seeds.
[09:27.600 --> 09:30.600]  So there will be Feminized Golden Goat, there will be Feminized Lemon Jeffrey coming up.
[09:30.600 --> 09:33.600]  That will be late this year, but it is in the works, you guys.
[09:33.600 --> 09:35.600]  It is coming up.
[09:35.600 --> 09:37.600]  So that is my current breeding projects and my future breeding plans.
[09:37.600 --> 09:39.600]  Keep listening to the podcast.
[09:39.600 --> 09:43.600]  You know that I like keeping you guys updated on my breeding projects.
[09:43.600 --> 09:45.600]  That is something I'm really passionate about.
[09:45.600 --> 09:47.600]  Something I get really excited about.
[09:47.600 --> 09:51.600]  I feel like a lot of my listeners are equally as passionate and excited about it as myself.
[09:51.600 --> 09:53.600]  New seeds are always fun.
[09:53.600 --> 09:57.600]  So that is a great way to segue into my next topic.
[09:57.600 --> 10:00.600]  My next topic is the Indoexpo.
[10:00.600 --> 10:04.600]  Indoexpo was in Denver on January 27th and 28th.
[10:04.600 --> 10:06.600]  They were at the Denver Mart.
[10:06.600 --> 10:15.600]  Indoexpo is an industry trade show that brought a lot of great vendors and educators from Colorado and around the country.
[10:15.600 --> 10:21.600]  Possibly around the world because there were breeders and quite a few folks from other countries there.
[10:21.600 --> 10:27.600]  So it brought folks from around the world to display their cannabis industry related items.
[10:27.600 --> 10:31.600]  There was a lot of Grow related stuff, a lot of packaging.
[10:31.600 --> 10:33.600]  We'll talk about that in a minute.
[10:33.600 --> 10:38.600]  The first day of Indoexpo was Industry Day.
[10:38.600 --> 10:45.600]  Which meant basically only folks with cannabis businesses or related to cannabis businesses were invited.
[10:45.600 --> 10:50.600]  So the always lovely, always beautiful, always on the fucking move Jenny Beth was actually part of the street team.
[10:50.600 --> 10:56.600]  She drove all over Southern Colorado and went to grow stores, dispensaries, grows.
[10:56.600 --> 11:01.600]  Whatever ancillary type of business that she felt like would be a good fit for the Indoexpo.
[11:01.600 --> 11:07.600]  She drove around and made sure they were all invited and had passes so that their managers and owners and buyers could all show up to this event.
[11:07.600 --> 11:09.600]  And see what was available for the industry.
[11:09.600 --> 11:11.600]  So that was Industry Day.
[11:11.600 --> 11:19.600]  Unfortunately something happened to where a lot of those passes were given out to people who were not part of any industry.
[11:19.600 --> 11:21.600]  Because it was extra crowded on Saturday.
[11:22.600 --> 11:35.600]  It was supposed to be the day where if you own a grow you can walk through the grow and go see Veg Bloom and Botanicare and New Millennium and every other company that was there.
[11:35.600 --> 11:37.600]  There were probably 50 nutrient companies there you guys.
[11:37.600 --> 11:39.600]  Microbe Life was there.
[11:39.600 --> 11:41.600]  I believe I saw Nectar of the Gods there.
[11:41.600 --> 11:43.600]  Anyway all of your nutrient companies were there.
[11:44.600 --> 11:51.600]  There were a lot of other products there but the idea was that people that owned grows or dispensaries could walk through and speak directly to the people that run those companies.
[11:51.600 --> 11:55.600]  And they could pitch their products to them without the general public overwhelming them.
[11:55.600 --> 12:01.600]  Unfortunately a lot of general public was able to get those passes or got in somehow.
[12:01.600 --> 12:03.600]  And Saturday was kind of, it was fun.
[12:03.600 --> 12:05.600]  Don't get me wrong I had a good time.
[12:05.600 --> 12:07.600]  But it was a little bit overcrowded.
[12:07.600 --> 12:09.600]  It was hard to talk to all the people that I wanted to visit with.
[12:09.600 --> 12:12.600]  And it kind of, it was a little overwhelming.
[12:12.600 --> 12:14.600]  I'm not dissing the event at all.
[12:14.600 --> 12:16.600]  It was a great fucking time.
[12:16.600 --> 12:18.600]  But it was a lot of people to deal with on Saturday.
[12:18.600 --> 12:20.600]  I did have a great time.
[12:20.600 --> 12:24.600]  I did have to sneak to the car for a couple of smoke breaks because that was a lot of people to deal with.
[12:24.600 --> 12:30.600]  Sunday however was supposed to be public day but it felt like it kind of got turned around.
[12:30.600 --> 12:36.600]  It felt like there was way more people there Saturday and Sunday was pretty chilled out.
[12:36.600 --> 12:40.600]  I got to talk to almost all of the booths I was looking for.
[12:40.600 --> 12:44.600]  I was able to find and have a conversation with all of the people that I was looking for.
[12:44.600 --> 12:46.600]  So Sunday was a great day.
[12:46.600 --> 12:50.600]  I've got a list here of people that I want to try and remember to mention.
[12:50.600 --> 12:52.600]  Let's see.
[12:52.600 --> 12:54.600]  Vegbloom.
[12:54.600 --> 12:56.600]  I got to hang out with the folks from Vegbloom for quite a while.
[12:56.600 --> 12:58.600]  We had great conversations.
[12:58.600 --> 13:00.600]  They complimented my flowers and my photography.
[13:00.600 --> 13:02.600]  They knew who I was.
[13:02.600 --> 13:04.600]  They threw me a couple of samples.
[13:04.600 --> 13:08.600]  When I walked past the New Millennium booth they grabbed me and took pictures with me.
[13:08.600 --> 13:10.600]  They treated me like royalty.
[13:10.600 --> 13:12.600]  So big shout out to New Millennium.
[13:12.600 --> 13:14.600]  Jinxproof.
[13:14.600 --> 13:16.600]  I saw Jinxproof.
[13:16.600 --> 13:18.600]  He gave me a high five.
[13:18.600 --> 13:20.600]  Got to hang out with Jinxproof for a minute.
[13:20.600 --> 13:22.600]  And Dung Beetles.
[13:22.600 --> 13:24.600]  Shout out to Jinx.
[13:24.600 --> 13:26.600]  Shout out to Dung.
[13:26.600 --> 13:28.600]  You guys support autism and autism awareness.
[13:28.600 --> 13:30.600]  Also big shout out to the Dabbing Granny and Grumpy Grandpa.
[13:30.600 --> 13:32.600]  What's up you guys?
[13:32.600 --> 13:34.600]  This is us.
[13:34.600 --> 13:36.600]  I walk in and Trippy G, the edible dude was there.
[13:36.600 --> 13:38.600]  Dabbing Granny and Grumpy Grandpa and Miss Jenny Beth were all hanging out waiting for me.
[13:38.600 --> 13:40.600]  So shout out to Dabbing Granny.
[13:40.600 --> 13:42.600]  Got to get a big ol' granny hug.
[13:42.600 --> 13:44.600]  Got to finally...
[13:44.600 --> 13:46.600]  I think that may have been the first time I ever actually met Grumpy Grandpa.
[13:46.600 --> 13:48.600]  I may have been in the same room with him before but I don't think we ever met.
[13:48.600 --> 13:50.600]  Hence the name Grumpy Grandpa.
[13:50.600 --> 13:52.600]  But he was a really cool dude.
[13:52.600 --> 13:54.600]  He's fucking chilled out.
[13:54.600 --> 13:56.600]  I don't know why they call him Grumpy.
[13:56.600 --> 13:58.600]  He's just not outgoing.
[13:58.600 --> 14:00.600]  It's really funny because Jenny Beth is a little overwhelming.
[14:00.600 --> 14:02.600]  She's really outgoing.
[14:02.600 --> 14:04.600]  She's kind of a social butterfly.
[14:04.600 --> 14:06.600]  And so is Granny.
[14:06.600 --> 14:08.600]  And so they would just go...
[14:08.600 --> 14:10.600]  And just go social everywhere.
[14:10.600 --> 14:12.600]  And Grumpy Grandpa and I would just kind of sit there and watch.
[14:12.600 --> 14:14.600]  Like, God, look how obnoxious they are.
[14:14.600 --> 14:16.600]  But it was fun.
[14:16.600 --> 14:18.600]  Let's see.
[14:18.600 --> 14:20.600]  Who else did I run into?
[14:20.600 --> 14:22.600]  Dude, Colin Gordon from the Ethos Collective and Ethos Seeds.
[14:22.600 --> 14:24.600]  I got to spend probably 45 minutes to an hour just shooting the shit and talking shop with Colin from the Ethos Collective.
[14:24.600 --> 14:26.600]  He may have been there.
[14:26.600 --> 14:28.600]  I don't know.
[14:28.600 --> 14:30.600]  I got to spend probably 45 minutes to an hour just shooting the shit and talking shop with Colin from the Ethos Collective.
[14:30.600 --> 14:32.600]  He may have sent me home with a bag of everything Ethos has ever bred.
[14:32.600 --> 14:34.600]  With maybe six or seven of a few things in there.
[14:34.600 --> 14:36.600]  Because they've got my grateful dog in there.
[14:36.600 --> 14:38.600]  We had great conversations.
[14:38.600 --> 14:40.600]  We talked about working on stuff in the future.
[14:40.600 --> 14:42.600]  He's got great shit coming up in the future that I can't spill for him.
[14:42.600 --> 14:44.600]  But you guys should check out what Colin Gordon and Ethos is doing.
[14:44.600 --> 14:46.600]  Great conversation, man.
[14:46.600 --> 14:48.600]  If you ever listen to this dude, thanks for treating me with much respect and hanging out.
[14:48.600 --> 14:50.600]  And stepping away from your booth for a few minutes to actually have a conversation with me.
[14:50.600 --> 14:52.600]  And I'll see you guys in the next one.
[14:52.600 --> 14:54.600]  Bye.
[14:58.600 --> 15:00.600]  I'm going to be honest.
[15:00.600 --> 15:02.600]  I was actually in a conversation with me outside of the booth.
[15:02.600 --> 15:04.600]  When people saw Colin and myself standing in the back of his booth just chatting.
[15:04.600 --> 15:06.600]  They kind of crowded up and it got a little congested.
[15:06.600 --> 15:08.600]  We kind of fucked up traffic right there for a minute.
[15:08.600 --> 15:10.600]  So we had to walk away.
[15:10.600 --> 15:12.600]  But shout out to Colin for taking time.
[15:12.600 --> 15:14.600]  He's making money.
[15:14.600 --> 15:16.600]  And he stepped away from making money to come hang out with me.
[15:16.600 --> 15:18.600]  So I appreciate that.
[15:18.600 --> 15:20.600]  Thank you.
[15:20.600 --> 15:22.600]  Those Ethos seeds are not cheap, you guys.
[15:22.600 --> 15:24.600]  Big shout out to my friend Twisty Seeds.
[15:24.600 --> 15:26.600]  What's up, dude?
[15:26.600 --> 15:28.600]  Big shout out to my friend, Jeremy and Cheryl.
[15:28.600 --> 15:30.600]  We got to hang out with them.
[15:30.600 --> 15:32.600]  We just do laps around this event.
[15:32.600 --> 15:34.600]  You guys, you just mill around.
[15:34.600 --> 15:36.600]  It's like an RV show.
[15:36.600 --> 15:38.600]  It's a trade show.
[15:38.600 --> 15:40.600]  You just walk up and down the aisles and you look at all the things you want to see.
[15:40.600 --> 15:42.600]  And see all the people you want to talk to.
[15:42.600 --> 15:44.600]  And it's weird because every time you go up and down the aisle, you see something you missed last time.
[15:44.600 --> 15:46.600]  But we kept running into Jeremy and Cheryl.
[15:46.600 --> 15:48.600]  Just kept crossing them, saying hi.
[15:48.600 --> 15:50.600]  I ran into the dude and Scotty from the Dude Grow Show.
[15:50.600 --> 15:52.600]  I ran into them separately.
[15:52.600 --> 15:54.600]  But big shout out to the dude and Scotty.
[15:54.600 --> 15:56.600]  We talked about recording, but Guru wasn't there with the recording gear on time.
[15:56.600 --> 15:58.600]  Things just weren't coming together.
[15:58.600 --> 16:00.600]  So like a bunch of stoners, we said, maybe next time, bro.
[16:00.600 --> 16:02.600]  I've got the words Hash Gift.
[16:02.600 --> 16:04.600]  So once again, thanks to the dude who met me as I was in line trying to check in.
[16:04.600 --> 16:06.600]  He's like, bro, I got a gift for you.
[16:06.600 --> 16:08.600]  And he gave me some tasty concentrates.
[16:08.600 --> 16:10.600]  It's some high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[16:10.600 --> 16:12.600]  And it tastes amazing.
[16:12.600 --> 16:14.600]  Thank you, bro.
[16:14.600 --> 16:16.600]  Also, huge, huge shout out to my friend known as Mary's Motivation.
[16:16.600 --> 16:18.600]  She's a great person.
[16:18.600 --> 16:20.600]  She's a great person.
[16:20.600 --> 16:22.600]  She's a great person.
[16:22.600 --> 16:24.600]  Also, huge shout out to my friend known as Mary's Motivation on Instagram and on social media.
[16:24.600 --> 16:26.600]  He's Mary's Motivation or just Mary Motivation at this point.
[16:26.600 --> 16:28.600]  Instagram keeps fucking with people.
[16:28.600 --> 16:30.600]  But Mary's Motivation.
[16:30.600 --> 16:32.600]  Of course, my friend Brett.
[16:32.600 --> 16:34.600]  Brett, I love you every day, bro.
[16:34.600 --> 16:36.600]  We need to hang out more frequently.
[16:36.600 --> 16:38.600]  You are a ball of positive energy.
[16:38.600 --> 16:40.600]  We need to smoke some turps and high five and get weird on social media together.
[16:40.600 --> 16:42.600]  I miss you, bro.
[16:42.600 --> 16:44.600]  Let's hang out.
[16:44.600 --> 16:46.600]  It's always good seeing Brett.
[16:46.600 --> 16:48.600]  Max and Dwayne, TNT Extract.
[16:48.600 --> 16:50.600]  I don't see those guys very often.
[16:50.600 --> 16:52.600]  Huge shout out to my friends at Nerds Genetics.
[16:52.600 --> 16:54.600]  Nerds Genetics and Brothers Grimm were sharing a booth.
[16:54.600 --> 16:56.600]  When I walked into there, it felt like I was walking into Cheers.
[16:56.600 --> 16:58.600]  I was Norm.
[16:58.600 --> 17:00.600]  I was like, Ross DeJeff.
[17:00.600 --> 17:02.600]  Everybody was happy to see me.
[17:02.600 --> 17:04.600]  All my friends at Nerds gave me.
[17:04.600 --> 17:06.600]  I got a pack of everything.
[17:06.600 --> 17:08.600]  They've bread plus some stuff that they've never released.
[17:08.600 --> 17:10.600]  I'm going to grow some of that out and send them some pictures.
[17:10.600 --> 17:12.600]  Possibly cross some of that stuff too.
[17:12.600 --> 17:14.600]  Some iry stuff.
[17:14.600 --> 17:16.600]  You never know.
[17:16.600 --> 17:18.600]  Shout out to my friends at Nerds Genetics for treating myself and Jenny Beth like royalty.
[17:18.600 --> 17:20.600]  We hung out for quite a while in their booth.
[17:20.600 --> 17:22.600]  I ran into Bag Seed Jesse.
[17:22.600 --> 17:24.600]  It's always a pleasure to see Bag Seed Jesse.
[17:24.600 --> 17:26.600]  What's up, bro?
[17:26.600 --> 17:28.600]  Huge shout out to an Amsterdam legend who is in Colorado.
[17:28.600 --> 17:30.600]  A lot of people don't realize who they're fucking with when they're talking to this guy.
[17:30.600 --> 17:32.600]  He is an Amsterdam cannabis legend.
[17:32.600 --> 17:34.600]  He runs a shop in Denver.
[17:34.600 --> 17:36.600]  He's known as Chuck the Lemon Man.
[17:36.600 --> 17:38.600]  He's the guy with the white eyebrows.
[17:38.600 --> 17:40.600]  The super pale white guy.
[17:40.600 --> 17:42.600]  The only guy there paler than me.
[17:42.600 --> 17:44.600]  He's a guy that I've seen on the internet.
[17:44.600 --> 17:46.600]  He's a guy that I've seen on the internet.
[17:46.600 --> 17:48.600]  The only guy there paler than me.
[17:48.600 --> 17:50.600]  Shout out to Chuck the Lemon Man.
[17:50.600 --> 17:52.600]  We bumped into each other a couple times.
[17:52.600 --> 17:54.600]  Chuck is a well-known dude.
[17:54.600 --> 17:56.600]  He's a very humble guy.
[17:56.600 --> 17:58.600]  He always takes a minute to say hi.
[17:58.600 --> 18:00.600]  Ask me how I'm doing.
[18:00.600 --> 18:02.600]  We actually have a conversation.
[18:02.600 --> 18:04.600]  When you bump into people at these events, sometimes you bump into people.
[18:04.600 --> 18:06.600]  You say, hey, what's up, man?
[18:06.600 --> 18:08.600]  How you doing?
[18:08.600 --> 18:10.600]  Good.
[18:10.600 --> 18:12.600]  Me too.
[18:12.600 --> 18:14.600]  Cool, cool.
[18:14.600 --> 18:16.600]  You tell him how you are.
[18:16.600 --> 18:18.600]  I ask him back.
[18:18.600 --> 18:20.600]  How are you, Chuck?
[18:20.600 --> 18:22.600]  He tells me how Chuck is.
[18:22.600 --> 18:24.600]  It's not just a fake interaction to look good on social media.
[18:24.600 --> 18:26.600]  We're at the event.
[18:26.600 --> 18:28.600]  We're in the same business.
[18:28.600 --> 18:30.600]  We're two people that have compassion and care about each other.
[18:30.600 --> 18:32.600]  Seeing Chuck is always cool.
[18:32.600 --> 18:34.600]  Good to see you, man.
[18:34.600 --> 18:36.600]  Shout out to Chuck the Lemon Man and Verdi.
[18:36.600 --> 18:38.600]  My friend Tony from New Mexico gave me some rosin.
[18:38.600 --> 18:40.600]  I am always dissing on rosin.
[18:40.600 --> 18:42.600]  Rosin usually tastes like a popsicle.
[18:42.600 --> 18:44.600]  I'm not a fan of rosin.
[18:44.600 --> 18:46.600]  You can hate me all you want for that.
[18:46.600 --> 18:48.600]  I love smoking BHO.
[18:48.600 --> 18:50.600]  I love batters.
[18:50.600 --> 18:52.600]  I love high cannabinoid full spectrum extracts.
[18:52.600 --> 18:54.600]  I love Shatter.
[18:54.600 --> 18:56.600]  I'm not a fan of the rosin.
[18:56.600 --> 18:58.600]  That being said, I met Tony at the Dude Grows Cup last year.
[18:58.600 --> 19:00.600]  I gave him some seeds of the Arise.
[19:00.600 --> 19:02.600]  He grew the Arise to perfection.
[19:02.600 --> 19:04.600]  Then he pressed the Arise.
[19:04.600 --> 19:06.600]  He did something right because it doesn't taste like burnt popcorn.
[19:06.600 --> 19:08.600]  I'm not a fan of the Arise.
[19:08.600 --> 19:10.600]  I'm not a fan of the Arise.
[19:10.600 --> 19:12.600]  He did something right because it doesn't taste like burnt popcorn.
[19:12.600 --> 19:14.600]  It tastes like Arise.
[19:14.600 --> 19:16.600]  Shout out to Tony for the correctly done rosin.
[19:16.600 --> 19:18.600]  Good job, dude.
[19:18.600 --> 19:20.600]  Also, I bumped into Claire several times.
[19:20.600 --> 19:22.600]  What up, Claire?
[19:22.600 --> 19:24.600]  It's good seeing you.
[19:24.600 --> 19:26.600]  It's always good seeing Claire.
[19:26.600 --> 19:28.600]  She's just always got a good smile.
[19:28.600 --> 19:30.600]  She's just such a good ball of energy and such a sweet lady.
[19:30.600 --> 19:32.600]  Good seeing you, Claire.
[19:32.600 --> 19:34.600]  Speaking of sweet ladies, I ran into Maddie several times.
[19:34.600 --> 19:36.600]  Maddie and Spence were there.
[19:36.600 --> 19:38.600]  Spence is just as tall as me and he's got the dreadlocks and the big beard.
[19:38.600 --> 19:40.600]  We're easy to spot.
[19:40.600 --> 19:42.600]  Bumped into Spence and Maddie a whole bunch of times.
[19:42.600 --> 19:44.600]  Of course, we saw Frosty Organics up there.
[19:44.600 --> 19:46.600]  What's up, bro?
[19:46.600 --> 19:48.600]  Get a haircut, you dirty hippie.
[19:48.600 --> 19:50.600]  Big shout out to Fish and Steph.
[19:50.600 --> 19:52.600]  It's good seeing you guys.
[19:52.600 --> 19:54.600]  A whole bunch of other people who...
[19:54.600 --> 19:56.600]  You guys, keep in mind, I eat edibles and take dabs the whole time I'm there.
[19:56.600 --> 19:58.600]  I left out some people.
[19:58.600 --> 20:00.600]  I made a whole bunch of new friends.
[20:00.600 --> 20:02.600]  Shout out to all my new friends and all of the people that I skipped on.
[20:02.600 --> 20:04.600]  I did get to see quite a few people.
[20:04.600 --> 20:06.600]  I'm sure I missed a few booths.
[20:06.600 --> 20:08.600]  One thing that I did make sure to take note of
[20:08.600 --> 20:10.600]  was all of the seed sales.
[20:10.600 --> 20:12.600]  Holy crap, you guys.
[20:12.600 --> 20:14.600]  Ethos was killing it with seed sales.
[20:14.600 --> 20:16.600]  There were a couple of booths that had...
[20:16.600 --> 20:18.600]  They were teaming up.
[20:18.600 --> 20:20.600]  The booths were fairly priced,
[20:20.600 --> 20:22.600]  but it was much wiser if two or three seed companies
[20:22.600 --> 20:24.600]  would get one booth together
[20:24.600 --> 20:26.600]  and just vend like crazy out of there.
[20:26.600 --> 20:28.600]  Compound, Genetics, Archive,
[20:28.600 --> 20:30.600]  Exotic, and Brothers Grimm
[20:30.600 --> 20:32.600]  all had lines around the booth
[20:32.600 --> 20:34.600]  and were like,
[20:34.600 --> 20:36.600]  all had lines around the block.
[20:36.600 --> 20:38.600]  Ethos had a line for a little while,
[20:38.600 --> 20:40.600]  but man, these guys were killing it.
[20:40.600 --> 20:42.600]  I heard some weird
[20:42.600 --> 20:44.600]  things that I think were bullshit.
[20:44.600 --> 20:46.600]  People tried to claim
[20:46.600 --> 20:48.600]  that people were paying people to stand in line
[20:48.600 --> 20:50.600]  and people were paying hot chicks to come around those booths.
[20:50.600 --> 20:52.600]  No, you guys.
[20:52.600 --> 20:54.600]  That's the shit that happens
[20:54.600 --> 20:56.600]  when your seeds are hot like that.
[20:56.600 --> 20:58.600]  Nobody was paying anybody to come there.
[20:58.600 --> 21:00.600]  Those people were all paying to go buy seeds from those booths.
[21:00.600 --> 21:02.600]  That guy that nobody knew
[21:02.600 --> 21:04.600]  who he was at that one booth,
[21:04.600 --> 21:06.600]  that's cap.
[21:06.600 --> 21:08.600]  Nobody knew who he was. Kind of funny.
[21:08.600 --> 21:10.600]  But nobody paid anybody
[21:10.600 --> 21:12.600]  to stand in line. Those people were all standing in line
[21:12.600 --> 21:14.600]  to pay between $100 and $250
[21:14.600 --> 21:16.600]  for a pack of seeds from those people.
[21:16.600 --> 21:18.600]  The hype was real, you guys.
[21:18.600 --> 21:20.600]  People were out there looking for seeds.
[21:20.600 --> 21:22.600]  Seeds were probably the most lucrative sales,
[21:22.600 --> 21:24.600]  the most lucrative booths,
[21:24.600 --> 21:26.600]  the most profitable booths,
[21:26.600 --> 21:28.600]  were the seed companies by far
[21:28.600 --> 21:30.600]  that weekend, I think.
[21:30.600 --> 21:32.600]  I mentioned before Compound, Archive,
[21:32.600 --> 21:34.600]  Exotic, Brothers Graham,
[21:34.600 --> 21:36.600]  Ethos, Nerds Genetics, Top Dogs,
[21:36.600 --> 21:38.600]  Twisties.
[21:38.600 --> 21:40.600]  There were a bunch of great seed companies out there.
[21:40.600 --> 21:42.600]  I did not have a booth. I was walking around
[21:42.600 --> 21:44.600]  with a backpack filled with seeds
[21:44.600 --> 21:46.600]  and I was giving packs away
[21:46.600 --> 21:48.600]  to my friends and people that walked up
[21:48.600 --> 21:50.600]  and knew who I was.
[21:50.600 --> 21:52.600]  I gave a bunch of seeds to my fellow
[21:52.600 --> 21:54.600]  breeder friends. Anybody that gave me a pack of seeds
[21:54.600 --> 21:56.600]  definitely got a pack or two
[21:56.600 --> 21:58.600]  in return.
[21:58.600 --> 22:00.600]  Seeds seemed to be the most popular thing
[22:00.600 --> 22:02.600]  between me and my friends and most of the
[22:02.600 --> 22:04.600]  people that I talked to.
[22:04.600 --> 22:06.600]  Also, there was a whole slew
[22:06.600 --> 22:08.600]  of LED lighting available.
[22:08.600 --> 22:10.600]  Everybody had an LED booth.
[22:10.600 --> 22:12.600]  They were trying to pitch you their newest,
[22:12.600 --> 22:14.600]  hottest, or their coolest, I guess,
[22:14.600 --> 22:16.600]  LEDs. I saw this one guy, every time I would
[22:16.600 --> 22:18.600]  walk by, he'd be like, put your hand on it
[22:18.600 --> 22:20.600]  and he'd be showing everybody how cool the LED light
[22:20.600 --> 22:22.600]  was because you can actually
[22:22.600 --> 22:24.600]  touch that light while it's running all day and it never got
[22:24.600 --> 22:26.600]  too hot, which is kind of cool.
[22:26.600 --> 22:28.600]  Everybody had an LED booth.
[22:28.600 --> 22:30.600]  Everybody else had a CBD product.
[22:30.600 --> 22:32.600]  There were tons of CBD
[22:32.600 --> 22:34.600]  products just being delivered in different
[22:34.600 --> 22:36.600]  ways. Sprays, rubs,
[22:36.600 --> 22:38.600]  however you can think
[22:38.600 --> 22:40.600]  of putting a CBD product into your body,
[22:40.600 --> 22:42.600]  it was available there. There were trim
[22:42.600 --> 22:44.600]  machines. There were some trim machines
[22:44.600 --> 22:46.600]  that I watched fucking destroy product and there were
[22:46.600 --> 22:48.600]  some trim machines that I thought might intimidate
[22:48.600 --> 22:50.600]  my trimmers. I won't ever
[22:50.600 --> 22:52.600]  buy a trim machine. We will not use a trim machine
[22:52.600 --> 22:54.600]  in the commercial grow, but there were a couple
[22:54.600 --> 22:56.600]  there that should make my trimmers nervous.
[22:56.600 --> 22:58.600]  There was a lot of packaging
[22:58.600 --> 23:00.600]  supplies. Tons of packaging
[23:00.600 --> 23:02.600]  supplies. Everything that
[23:02.600 --> 23:04.600]  goes out of a dispensary has to be in some sort
[23:04.600 --> 23:06.600]  of a childproof container. I've got tons of these
[23:06.600 --> 23:08.600]  little bottles right here. These bottles that you squeeze
[23:08.600 --> 23:10.600]  them and they pop open.
[23:10.600 --> 23:12.600]  I've got a ton of these fucking things sitting all
[23:12.600 --> 23:14.600]  over the place because every time I buy concentrates
[23:14.600 --> 23:16.600]  they come in one of these.
[23:16.600 --> 23:18.600]  There were companies there or also these little
[23:18.600 --> 23:20.600]  little like
[23:20.600 --> 23:22.600]  aluminum kind of style envelope
[23:22.600 --> 23:24.600]  sort of things with little Terry off tops. You can
[23:24.600 --> 23:26.600]  hear it. There's a bunch of
[23:26.600 --> 23:28.600]  those available. Just anything you can think
[23:28.600 --> 23:30.600]  of to put a cannabis related product or a
[23:30.600 --> 23:32.600]  seed in, the packaging
[23:32.600 --> 23:34.600]  was available for that. There
[23:34.600 --> 23:36.600]  were a couple of pretty cool like clothing booths
[23:36.600 --> 23:38.600]  that were selling legalization
[23:38.600 --> 23:40.600]  promotion t-shirts and just cannabis
[23:40.600 --> 23:42.600]  related clothing.
[23:42.600 --> 23:44.600]  Normal was there. I spoke with the folks with
[23:44.600 --> 23:46.600]  Normal. Normal had a big booth.
[23:46.600 --> 23:48.600]  I talked to one of the guys from Normal and
[23:48.600 --> 23:50.600]  he actually gave me his card and said that he would like to
[23:50.600 --> 23:52.600]  be on the podcast soon. So if I can arrange
[23:52.600 --> 23:54.600]  that we're going to get a representative
[23:54.600 --> 23:56.600]  from the Colorado branch of the National
[23:56.600 --> 23:58.600]  Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
[23:58.600 --> 24:00.600]  The longest running cannabis
[24:00.600 --> 24:02.600]  legalization group
[24:02.600 --> 24:04.600]  activist group in North
[24:04.600 --> 24:06.600]  America. We will get one of their representatives
[24:06.600 --> 24:08.600]  on the podcast here pretty soon.
[24:08.600 --> 24:10.600]  And then like I mentioned earlier, every
[24:10.600 --> 24:12.600]  nutrient company was there. If
[24:12.600 --> 24:14.600]  you use those nutrients, they probably had
[24:14.600 --> 24:16.600]  a rep there and
[24:16.600 --> 24:18.600]  the best part is most of these companies were giving
[24:18.600 --> 24:20.600]  out free samples. Vegbloom gave me free
[24:20.600 --> 24:22.600]  stuff.
[24:22.600 --> 24:24.600]  New Millennium gave me, offered
[24:24.600 --> 24:26.600]  to give me free stuff, but it was big five gallon
[24:26.600 --> 24:28.600]  containers and I wasn't carrying that shit to
[24:28.600 --> 24:30.600]  the car and I was like, nope, I'm good.
[24:30.600 --> 24:32.600]  But everybody was giving away free stuff. A lot
[24:32.600 --> 24:34.600]  of the seed companies gave me a free pack of seeds
[24:34.600 --> 24:36.600]  or two. I turned down
[24:36.600 --> 24:38.600]  more free stuff than I accepted because I don't
[24:38.600 --> 24:40.600]  if I'm not going to use it, if I don't have a space
[24:40.600 --> 24:42.600]  for it or an idea of how and when I'm going to use
[24:42.600 --> 24:44.600]  it, I don't feel like I should take a product from you
[24:44.600 --> 24:46.600]  because you're trying to promote your brand. You're trying
[24:46.600 --> 24:48.600]  to get that out there. Just like myself, if I
[24:48.600 --> 24:50.600]  give somebody seeds, I want them to grow it. I don't want
[24:50.600 --> 24:52.600]  that to go in their safe. I want it to
[24:52.600 --> 24:54.600]  go in some dirt and I feel the
[24:54.600 --> 24:56.600]  same way if you give me a bottle of nutrients
[24:56.600 --> 24:58.600]  and it's not Vegbloom or New Millennium
[24:58.600 --> 25:00.600]  or very more Mammoth. Mammoth was
[25:00.600 --> 25:02.600]  there also, by the way, if you don't give me one of those
[25:02.600 --> 25:04.600]  I'm probably not going to use it. So if
[25:04.600 --> 25:06.600]  they're like, take a bottle of like, no, I'm pretty
[25:06.600 --> 25:08.600]  locked into what I'm doing and I think
[25:08.600 --> 25:10.600]  some of them got offended, but I think some of them most
[25:10.600 --> 25:12.600]  of them understood like, oh yeah, thanks for not
[25:12.600 --> 25:14.600]  taking my product that you're going to probably
[25:14.600 --> 25:16.600]  give away and I'll never even see the results.
[25:16.600 --> 25:18.600]  But anyway, there was a lot of
[25:18.600 --> 25:20.600]  a lot of product being given away.
[25:20.600 --> 25:22.600]  Lots of great vendors, lots of great reps.
[25:22.600 --> 25:24.600]  Another aspect of the event was
[25:24.600 --> 25:26.600]  the free educational seminars.
[25:26.600 --> 25:28.600]  I did not attend any of them because I
[25:28.600 --> 25:30.600]  wanted to go be social and I wanted to go see
[25:30.600 --> 25:32.600]  all of the booths. I had a lot
[25:32.600 --> 25:34.600]  of friends there that I only get to see when events like
[25:34.600 --> 25:36.600]  this come around. So I skipped on all of the
[25:36.600 --> 25:38.600]  seminars. I did hear great things about
[25:38.600 --> 25:40.600]  them. I saw great pictures.
[25:40.600 --> 25:42.600]  I did not attend them, but that is
[25:42.600 --> 25:44.600]  one thing that they offer. So if you're there
[25:44.600 --> 25:46.600]  and you are interested in seminars, they're available.
[25:46.600 --> 25:48.600]  Go check them out next year because
[25:48.600 --> 25:50.600]  the Indo Expo will be back
[25:50.600 --> 25:52.600]  next year. From what I hear, it will be at the
[25:52.600 --> 25:54.600]  same place around the same time.
[25:54.600 --> 25:56.600]  Don't quote me on any of that. It's just stuff I've
[25:56.600 --> 25:58.600]  overheard. Might not even be any of my business yet.
[25:58.600 --> 26:00.600]  Anyway,
[26:00.600 --> 26:02.600]  one thing I should say about the
[26:02.600 --> 26:04.600]  Indo Expo is there was no
[26:04.600 --> 26:06.600]  consumption inside the event. You could
[26:06.600 --> 26:08.600]  not consume cannabis. They did have
[26:08.600 --> 26:10.600]  a small food court area with a couple
[26:10.600 --> 26:12.600]  of vendors selling food, and they
[26:12.600 --> 26:14.600]  also had a bar where you
[26:14.600 --> 26:16.600]  could consume alcohol.
[26:16.600 --> 26:18.600]  But no cannabis consumption inside the event.
[26:18.600 --> 26:20.600]  They were pretty cool about it. I saw
[26:20.600 --> 26:22.600]  a couple of people take a dab
[26:22.600 --> 26:24.600]  in different places, and people would just walk up
[26:24.600 --> 26:26.600]  and they'd remind you. They'd kind of be like, hey, now
[26:26.600 --> 26:28.600]  I know you need to medicate, but this is a no
[26:28.600 --> 26:30.600]  medicating event, so please don't let me see you doing
[26:30.600 --> 26:32.600]  that again. They didn't tackle anybody. They
[26:32.600 --> 26:34.600]  didn't arrest anybody. They just said, please
[26:34.600 --> 26:36.600]  don't do it again. And I assume those
[26:36.600 --> 26:38.600]  folks didn't do it again because once you get called
[26:38.600 --> 26:40.600]  out like that in an event like that, you're probably just like,
[26:40.600 --> 26:42.600]  oh shit, I was just a step away from
[26:42.600 --> 26:44.600]  getting in trouble. So, no consumption
[26:44.600 --> 26:46.600]  at the event, but
[26:46.600 --> 26:48.600]  if you were slightly discreet, they didn't
[26:48.600 --> 26:50.600]  really seem to care if you were consuming
[26:50.600 --> 26:52.600]  out on the grassy knoll outside
[26:52.600 --> 26:54.600]  because the Lodi's prefer the grassy
[26:54.600 --> 26:56.600]  knoll, if you get that movie reference, high
[26:56.600 --> 26:58.600]  five. But yeah, they didn't really
[26:58.600 --> 27:00.600]  care if you went out to your car, if you went out to the lawn
[27:00.600 --> 27:02.600]  and toked up a little bit and then came right back in. Nobody
[27:02.600 --> 27:04.600]  gave a shit, as long as you weren't smoking out
[27:04.600 --> 27:06.600]  inside the Denver Mart.
[27:06.600 --> 27:08.600]  So, it was a great event. Another
[27:08.600 --> 27:10.600]  thing I want to mention is with the lack
[27:10.600 --> 27:12.600]  of a Cannabis Cup, the
[27:12.600 --> 27:14.600]  Indo Expo was a great event to
[27:14.600 --> 27:16.600]  get all of my cannabis industry
[27:16.600 --> 27:18.600]  friends together in one place.
[27:18.600 --> 27:20.600]  Living in Pueblo, I'm a little bit
[27:20.600 --> 27:22.600]  I'm not in Denver, so I don't see everybody
[27:22.600 --> 27:24.600]  as frequently as I'd like to. And all
[27:24.600 --> 27:26.600]  of those people aren't always in Colorado.
[27:26.600 --> 27:28.600]  So, the folks from VegBloom,
[27:28.600 --> 27:30.600]  the folks from New Millennium, a lot
[27:30.600 --> 27:32.600]  of people from a lot of other brands and
[27:32.600 --> 27:34.600]  companies got to come to Colorado and they had a good
[27:34.600 --> 27:36.600]  excuse to come hang out. So,
[27:36.600 --> 27:38.600]  without a Cannabis Cup, the Indo Expo
[27:38.600 --> 27:40.600]  is a good reason for us to come and get
[27:40.600 --> 27:42.600]  together. So, it's kind of a nice supplement, even though
[27:42.600 --> 27:44.600]  we can't consume. It's still a great
[27:44.600 --> 27:46.600]  meeting of the minds and a gathering
[27:46.600 --> 27:48.600]  for like-minded folks. So, I had a great time.
[27:48.600 --> 27:50.600]  A huge shout out to everybody at the
[27:50.600 --> 27:52.600]  Indo Expo for treating me
[27:52.600 --> 27:54.600]  like royalty, for taking good care of me,
[27:54.600 --> 27:56.600]  for getting me in and out of the event
[27:56.600 --> 27:58.600]  smoothly. A big shout out
[27:58.600 --> 28:00.600]  to Jenny Beth for making sure that I had a
[28:00.600 --> 28:02.600]  pass for the Indo Expo. And also
[28:02.600 --> 28:04.600]  a shout out to our friend Priscilla
[28:04.600 --> 28:06.600]  for making sure that the Indo
[28:06.600 --> 28:08.600]  went smoothly for Jenny and
[28:08.600 --> 28:10.600]  myself as well. Jenny was an employee and
[28:10.600 --> 28:12.600]  Priscilla still made sure that Jenny had fun
[28:12.600 --> 28:14.600]  while she was attending the event
[28:14.600 --> 28:16.600]  and at the after party. So, shout out to everybody.
[28:16.600 --> 28:18.600]  Big super thanks to Jenny Beth.
[28:18.600 --> 28:20.600]  Thanks for taking good care of me that weekend. I had a good
[28:20.600 --> 28:22.600]  time with you. Can't wait for next
[28:22.600 --> 28:24.600]  year. Also, I gave away a lot
[28:24.600 --> 28:26.600]  of seeds, you guys. I gave away a lot
[28:26.600 --> 28:28.600]  of packages of iRegenetic seeds.
[28:28.600 --> 28:30.600]  I gave away some stuff that has never been given out
[28:30.600 --> 28:32.600]  before. I gave out some of the stuff that everybody
[28:32.600 --> 28:34.600]  has, but I
[28:34.600 --> 28:36.600]  cannot wait to see the photos
[28:36.600 --> 28:38.600]  that come from those freebies. That's all I
[28:38.600 --> 28:40.600]  want in return is either a lab test or
[28:40.600 --> 28:42.600]  a photo and I'll be a happy
[28:42.600 --> 28:44.600]  camper. Alright. So, Indo Expo
[28:44.600 --> 28:46.600]  was great. Thumbs up. Rasta Jeff
[28:46.600 --> 28:48.600]  approved. I'll be there next year.
[28:48.600 --> 28:50.600]  Can't wait to see you guys.
[28:50.600 --> 28:52.600]  Alright. I've got an email that kind of relates to the
[28:52.600 --> 28:54.600]  Indo Expo. It starts off and it
[28:54.600 --> 28:56.600]  says, if you ever read this on the air, my first name is
[28:56.600 --> 28:58.600]  cool, but let's hold off on the last name until
[28:58.600 --> 29:00.600]  I'm legal. And it says, hey Rasta Jeff,
[29:00.600 --> 29:02.600]  my name is Nick and I've been listening
[29:02.600 --> 29:04.600]  to the podcast for at least a year now.
[29:04.600 --> 29:06.600]  Hey Nick, thanks for listening. Good to meet you.
[29:06.600 --> 29:08.600]  He says, I finally got caught up and just wanted
[29:08.600 --> 29:10.600]  to thank you for what you do. I have followed
[29:10.600 --> 29:12.600]  your advice from my small 2x4
[29:12.600 --> 29:14.600]  home grow and have had great results.
[29:14.600 --> 29:16.600]  Hey man, I'm glad it's working for
[29:16.600 --> 29:18.600]  you. He said, I've had four successful harvests
[29:18.600 --> 29:20.600]  at home and I'm working on my fifth currently.
[29:20.600 --> 29:22.600]  I love your positive attitude about life
[29:22.600 --> 29:24.600]  and growing and I can honestly say
[29:24.600 --> 29:26.600]  you single-handedly pushed me
[29:26.600 --> 29:28.600]  to follow my passion. Hey man,
[29:28.600 --> 29:30.600]  I'm glad I was able to push somebody
[29:30.600 --> 29:32.600]  to follow their passion. Don't be afraid.
[29:32.600 --> 29:34.600]  Get up and do what you want to do because
[29:34.600 --> 29:36.600]  you'll resent yourself and you'll resent your life if you don't
[29:36.600 --> 29:38.600]  do what you want to do. So I'm glad I
[29:38.600 --> 29:40.600]  was able to light that fire under your ass and
[29:40.600 --> 29:42.600]  get you moving. I appreciate that.
[29:42.600 --> 29:44.600]  Where does it go? It says, I will
[29:44.600 --> 29:46.600]  be turning 21 at the beginning of March
[29:46.600 --> 29:48.600]  and I can't tell you how excited I am
[29:48.600 --> 29:50.600]  to get my badge. And by
[29:50.600 --> 29:52.600]  getting his badge, he means his Marijuana
[29:52.600 --> 29:54.600]  Enforcement Division badge so that he is able
[29:54.600 --> 29:56.600]  to work in the Colorado Medical
[29:56.600 --> 29:58.600]  Marijuana or Recreational Marijuana Industry
[29:58.600 --> 30:00.600]  legally. Everybody that works there has to have a
[30:00.600 --> 30:02.600]  badge. It requires
[30:02.600 --> 30:04.600]  a rigorous background check, it
[30:04.600 --> 30:06.600]  requires a fingerprint, it requires a little bit of money
[30:06.600 --> 30:08.600]  and you have to be 21 and you have
[30:08.600 --> 30:10.600]  to have a clean record. So this guy is
[30:10.600 --> 30:12.600]  waiting to turn 21 to get his Marijuana Enforcement
[30:12.600 --> 30:14.600]  Division badge because
[30:14.600 --> 30:16.600]  the message says, I want to be a grower in the industry
[30:16.600 --> 30:18.600]  and I've been trying to get my name out
[30:18.600 --> 30:20.600]  and educate myself as much as possible
[30:20.600 --> 30:22.600]  the last few years. I'm
[30:22.600 --> 30:24.600]  up just slightly north of Denver
[30:24.600 --> 30:26.600]  and was hoping to catch you at the Indo Expo
[30:26.600 --> 30:28.600]  last week but I don't think we ever
[30:28.600 --> 30:30.600]  crossed paths. Man, I was all
[30:30.600 --> 30:32.600]  over that place. There are several people that
[30:32.600 --> 30:34.600]  say they never saw me and I'm surprised because
[30:34.600 --> 30:36.600]  I saw the same shit like five times
[30:36.600 --> 30:38.600]  but, man, I'm tall, I've got
[30:38.600 --> 30:40.600]  dreadlocks, I'm a
[30:40.600 --> 30:42.600]  white dude with a big cheesy smile, I'm usually
[30:42.600 --> 30:44.600]  wearing sunglasses indoors. Next
[30:44.600 --> 30:46.600]  time you see me, man, just walk up, say hi,
[30:46.600 --> 30:48.600]  introduce yourself. I'm easy to
[30:48.600 --> 30:50.600]  talk to. Anyway, the message goes on
[30:50.600 --> 30:52.600]  to say, I admire everything you do and stand
[30:52.600 --> 30:54.600]  for and hope we can maybe sesh
[30:54.600 --> 30:56.600]  and talk about plants someday. I'll
[30:56.600 --> 30:58.600]  attach a few pics of the home grow, just
[30:58.600 --> 31:00.600]  flipped into flower two days ago and then he tells
[31:00.600 --> 31:02.600]  me what strains he's grown. He ends the email with
[31:02.600 --> 31:04.600]  keep making people happy
[31:04.600 --> 31:06.600]  from Nick. Hey, Nick, I appreciate this
[31:06.600 --> 31:08.600]  message, dude. This is a great email.
[31:08.600 --> 31:10.600]  First of all, you listen to the podcast and you're all caught
[31:10.600 --> 31:12.600]  up. That's awesome. I
[31:12.600 --> 31:14.600]  inspired you to do what you want to do.
[31:14.600 --> 31:16.600]  That's awesome. And you are
[31:16.600 --> 31:18.600]  out there trying to educate yourself and
[31:18.600 --> 31:20.600]  get your name out there as much as possible so that
[31:20.600 --> 31:22.600]  you can get yourself a position when the time comes.
[31:22.600 --> 31:24.600]  My advice right now,
[31:24.600 --> 31:26.600]  do not get yourself in trouble before
[31:26.600 --> 31:28.600]  you are old enough to even get this
[31:28.600 --> 31:30.600]  badge. Don't fuck it up before you get
[31:30.600 --> 31:32.600]  the opportunity. Also,
[31:32.600 --> 31:34.600]  education is key.
[31:34.600 --> 31:36.600]  Learn a lot about trellising and
[31:36.600 --> 31:38.600]  canopy control and stuff like that
[31:38.600 --> 31:40.600]  because you'll be, if you start to grow as
[31:40.600 --> 31:42.600]  a grow tech, you're going to be the one trellising
[31:42.600 --> 31:44.600]  and bottoming and cutting off all the bottom
[31:44.600 --> 31:46.600]  shit. So get familiar with that type
[31:46.600 --> 31:48.600]  of stuff. Get good at that. Also,
[31:48.600 --> 31:50.600]  if you plan on getting into
[31:50.600 --> 31:52.600]  the industry and you're a youngster like
[31:52.600 --> 31:54.600]  you are, you're going to have to
[31:54.600 --> 31:56.600]  earn the respect of your peers
[31:56.600 --> 31:58.600]  in the industry. There are people that have been doing this
[31:58.600 --> 32:00.600]  for way before we had medical
[32:00.600 --> 32:02.600]  marijuana and they were doing it illegally
[32:02.600 --> 32:04.600]  and a lot of them are the
[32:04.600 --> 32:06.600]  lead growers or
[32:06.600 --> 32:08.600]  cultivation directors at facilities
[32:08.600 --> 32:10.600]  now. You're going to have to work under somebody
[32:10.600 --> 32:12.600]  that's been doing it for a long time and
[32:12.600 --> 32:14.600]  has their methods figured out. Don't
[32:14.600 --> 32:16.600]  think you're going to go in there and introduce
[32:16.600 --> 32:18.600]  your methods to a facility.
[32:18.600 --> 32:20.600]  Nobody cares how you grow at home.
[32:20.600 --> 32:22.600]  This is how we do it at the Big Grow.
[32:22.600 --> 32:24.600]  This is how it works at the Big Grow.
[32:24.600 --> 32:26.600]  This is how we will continue to do it
[32:26.600 --> 32:28.600]  at the Big Grow. You will adjust to our
[32:28.600 --> 32:30.600]  style or you will adjust to the front
[32:30.600 --> 32:32.600]  door. That's kind of how it goes in a
[32:32.600 --> 32:34.600]  Big Grow. So go in there, ready to
[32:34.600 --> 32:36.600]  learn their style, but know what you're
[32:36.600 --> 32:38.600]  doing. Also, don't be afraid to
[32:38.600 --> 32:40.600]  start off as a trimmer.
[32:40.600 --> 32:42.600]  I'm not trying to belittle a
[32:42.600 --> 32:44.600]  trimmer. A trimmer is the entry level
[32:44.600 --> 32:46.600]  position in any grow. You're going to
[32:46.600 --> 32:48.600]  trim. You're going to sweep the floors.
[32:48.600 --> 32:50.600]  You're going to clean the bathrooms.
[32:50.600 --> 32:52.600]  Once you show that you can show up on time
[32:52.600 --> 32:54.600]  and follow instructions
[32:54.600 --> 32:56.600]  and think for yourself without
[32:56.600 --> 32:58.600]  fucking something up, that's when you will be
[32:58.600 --> 33:00.600]  allowed to advance in a grow.
[33:00.600 --> 33:02.600]  As a cultivation director, as the
[33:02.600 --> 33:04.600]  boss of several people in a grow, I
[33:04.600 --> 33:06.600]  pay attention to every person and the way that they
[33:06.600 --> 33:08.600]  handle every task I give them.
[33:08.600 --> 33:10.600]  If they can't follow instructions,
[33:10.600 --> 33:12.600]  I cannot trust them in the Big
[33:12.600 --> 33:14.600]  Grow without guidance over the
[33:14.600 --> 33:16.600]  weekend or at all by themselves.
[33:16.600 --> 33:18.600]  I have to have one of my assistant
[33:18.600 --> 33:20.600]  managers in there keeping an eye on those people
[33:20.600 --> 33:22.600]  because they are fucking savages
[33:22.600 --> 33:24.600]  and they could mess something up.
[33:24.600 --> 33:26.600]  So those people get put right back on
[33:26.600 --> 33:28.600]  the trim table. Oh, you kind of thought that this
[33:28.600 --> 33:30.600]  would be a good idea. You did shit I didn't say.
[33:30.600 --> 33:32.600]  Go back to the trim room and trim some more.
[33:32.600 --> 33:34.600]  And then once they realize, oh, I'm not supposed
[33:34.600 --> 33:36.600]  to do shit that Jeff doesn't say,
[33:36.600 --> 33:38.600]  we'll bring them back, let them try again.
[33:38.600 --> 33:40.600]  If they fuck up, back to the trim table.
[33:40.600 --> 33:42.600]  But if you're trimming, you can't mess up too much. You can cut buds
[33:42.600 --> 33:44.600]  in half or whatever, but we find out if
[33:44.600 --> 33:46.600]  you can be on time. We find out if you can follow
[33:46.600 --> 33:48.600]  instructions. We find out if you're
[33:48.600 --> 33:50.600]  fucking capable. We find
[33:50.600 --> 33:52.600]  out if you're going to mess up. Then we add
[33:52.600 --> 33:54.600]  more stuff slowly. Oh, this
[33:54.600 --> 33:56.600]  room is going to come down. We should defoliate it.
[33:56.600 --> 33:58.600]  I'll bring you in the room and say, defoliate
[33:58.600 --> 34:00.600]  this whole table in the next two hours. Don't
[34:00.600 --> 34:02.600]  move off of this table. I'll check on you every
[34:02.600 --> 34:04.600]  15 minutes. If you're on that table defoliating,
[34:04.600 --> 34:06.600]  you're following instructions, doing as you're told.
[34:06.600 --> 34:08.600]  If you're over at the other table, pulling leaves
[34:08.600 --> 34:10.600]  off the bottom, you're fucking up, not doing what I told
[34:10.600 --> 34:12.600]  you. I got to keep that in mind. I'm going to put
[34:12.600 --> 34:14.600]  you back in the trim table until next time you come back
[34:14.600 --> 34:16.600]  and can follow instructions for 30 minutes
[34:16.600 --> 34:18.600]  without fucking up. So don't
[34:18.600 --> 34:20.600]  be that guy. Be ready to go in there, follow instructions,
[34:20.600 --> 34:22.600]  do as you're told, grow with the team,
[34:22.600 --> 34:24.600]  assimilate to their style,
[34:24.600 --> 34:26.600]  don't try to force your style on their stuff,
[34:26.600 --> 34:28.600]  and never take your
[34:28.600 --> 34:30.600]  bugs and grow problems to
[34:30.600 --> 34:32.600]  your work grow. That's my advice for you,
[34:32.600 --> 34:34.600]  Nick. Dude, thanks for supporting
[34:34.600 --> 34:36.600]  the podcast. Thanks for listening for the past

[36:14.600 --> 36:16.600]  I apologize for skipping you.
[36:16.600 --> 36:18.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be back Thursday with one
[36:18.600 --> 36:20.600]  of those Throwback Thursday episodes
[36:20.600 --> 36:22.600]  and of course I'll be back Monday with fresh
[36:22.600 --> 36:24.600]  new content. I know there wasn't a lot of Grow Talk in
[36:24.600 --> 36:26.600]  this episode. It is cannabis news,
[36:26.600 --> 36:28.600]  education and conversation. This was the news
[36:28.600 --> 36:30.600]  and the conversation portion
[36:30.600 --> 36:32.600]  of that part. So I hope you guys enjoyed
[36:32.600 --> 36:34.600]  listening. I will be back Monday. Hopefully
[36:34.600 --> 36:36.600]  I'll put some Grow content into that episode.
[36:36.600 --> 36:38.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, hug the folks you love.
