[00:00.000 --> 00:04.200]  Alright, I'm doing something new. I usually don't press record during the dab session
[00:04.200 --> 00:08.920]  before the show. Tonight I've decided to press record right before I dab. I'm gonna take
[00:08.920 --> 00:13.180]  this dab and then we might jump into the show. Who knows? I may end up editing this part
[00:13.180 --> 00:17.440]  of the show out. I am heating up the dab nail right now, getting it nice and warm for myself.
[00:17.440 --> 00:21.760]  I've got a big fat dab lined up. We'll talk about that dab in just a moment. This is awkward
[00:21.760 --> 00:25.640]  because I'm trying to work the dab torch. I'm trying to hold the rig. I've got my dab
[00:25.640 --> 00:29.460]  prepared. And also I've got a microphone in my face. So that's a new obstacle to work
[00:29.460 --> 00:33.460]  with. But I'm sure I can figure this out. Getting the nail hot. It's nice and hot now.
[00:33.460 --> 00:37.180]  It needs a couple of seconds just to cool down. I got a carb cap within reach. I got
[00:37.180 --> 00:40.820]  my concentrate within reach. This is going to work out, ladies and gentlemen. I have
[00:40.820 --> 00:45.540]  faith in this endeavor. I feel like we're at the right temperature. Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:45.540 --> 01:10.560]  dab with me and then we will do a podcast. Oh wow. I am seriously lit as shit. So that's
[01:10.560 --> 01:16.000]  a fun way to start a podcast. I need to kind of get my brain together and catch my breath.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.720]  But let's get it going. Welcome. It's time for episode 491 of the Grow From Your Heart
[01:19.720 --> 01:24.440]  podcast. This episode of the show was brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now. If
[01:24.440 --> 01:29.280]  you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds
[01:29.280 --> 01:37.920]  Here Now and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com. If you are a regular listener of the show,
[01:37.920 --> 01:42.160]  you know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking. Let's talk
[01:42.160 --> 01:48.360]  about what I just dabbed. I just took a ridiculous dab of Lysergic Lemon Live Batter from our
[01:48.360 --> 01:53.960]  friends at Green Dot Labs. This is a blend of sour Best Lemons and sour animal. We heard
[01:53.960 --> 01:58.520]  about the sour animal in the last episode. On the package of the Lysergic Lemons, the
[01:58.520 --> 02:03.560]  flavor is described as lemon meringue, cleaner, and funk. And I'm going to agree with all
[02:03.560 --> 02:09.280]  of those. You immediately get that lemon meringue in your face. Boom. Punch of lemons. Then
[02:09.360 --> 02:14.480]  there is a sharp, astringent cleaner flavor. And it's pleasant. It is not bad at all. It
[02:14.480 --> 02:19.080]  sounds like it may not be good, but it is definitely delicious. Then on the exhale,
[02:19.080 --> 02:25.440]  I get a gross, delicious, funky, lemon cleaner sort of a flavor. It's very similar to that
[02:25.440 --> 02:30.720]  grossness of lemon G. It's kind of garlicky. It's kind of armpit-like. It's kind of gross
[02:30.720 --> 02:35.760]  and deliciously disgusting, but it's all topped off with this wonderful lemon flavor. And
[02:35.760 --> 02:42.120]  then the best part is this stuff gets me high as shit. Some concentrates get me stoned.
[02:42.120 --> 02:45.800]  Some give me a nice buzz. This one just makes me fucking high. I'm sure you could tell over
[02:45.800 --> 02:50.200]  the past couple of seconds. I've just gotten more energized and more rambly. This one makes
[02:50.200 --> 02:54.240]  me want to run laps, makes me want to go play my drums, makes me want to ramble. So this
[02:54.240 --> 02:59.800]  will be delicious and wonderful podcast concentrates. On the back of the package, it says the product
[02:59.800 --> 03:07.920]  does contain 65.65% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD. It is delicious. I'm high
[03:07.920 --> 03:11.480]  as shit. Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[03:11.480 --> 03:16.040]  All right. That was a fun way to start a show. I should do more dabs on the show like that.
[03:16.040 --> 03:20.300]  In this episode, I'm going to do a strain update or a strain review. A lot of people
[03:20.300 --> 03:24.080]  enjoy those strain reviews. I've gotten a couple of requests for one specific strain,
[03:24.080 --> 03:28.360]  and it's time to talk about that. Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to our
[03:28.360 --> 03:32.920]  friends who support the show on Patreon. Let's start off with a big Grow From Your
[03:32.920 --> 03:36.640]  Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to my buddy Fat Rabbit. How about a big thank
[03:36.640 --> 03:41.200]  you shout out to Big Toe Grows. I always want to send a big thank you shout out to Oki Grows

[04:19.960 --> 04:27.840]  the show via Patreon, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[04:27.840 --> 04:32.800]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen. All right, ladies and
[04:32.800 --> 04:36.240]  gentlemen, boys and girls, friends and foes, pimps and hoes, smokers and growers, all you
[04:36.240 --> 04:41.120]  bad motherfuckers. I got a great email asking about a specific strain. There is no reason
[04:41.120 --> 04:46.480]  to waste time. Let's jump right into this email so we can start a strain review. This
[04:46.480 --> 04:50.760]  email comes from our friend in Toronto, Canada. I'm not sure if they want their name said.
[04:50.760 --> 04:56.800]  They know who they are. The message goes just like this. Hey, Rasta Jeff, big up for all
[04:56.800 --> 05:02.640]  of the mad content. I just got authorization for 50 plants for medical usage. Nice. 50
[05:02.640 --> 05:07.600]  plants for medical use. I miss those days. It goes on to say, I just ordered some of
[05:07.600 --> 05:12.580]  your Hellfire OG. I thought that the parents would give a crazy contrast, so I ordered
[05:12.580 --> 05:17.380]  these beans. I like that you did some research and that you were intrigued by the parents
[05:17.380 --> 05:20.380]  and that you were excited to see what's going to come out of those. You are the type of
[05:20.380 --> 05:25.740]  grower that becomes a breeder in the future. That's the type of passion that leads to breeding.
[05:25.740 --> 05:29.580]  The message goes on. It says, if you could please give me a brief description of the
[05:29.580 --> 05:34.740]  phenos I may expect and any other tips with growing this strain, it would be much appreciated.
[05:34.740 --> 05:40.740]  I'm spreading your name and love across Toronto. Thanks for everything you do. Stay good, never
[05:40.740 --> 05:45.300]  synthetic. Then they sign it with their name. Big up, big shout out, big respect to my new
[05:45.300 --> 05:50.580]  friend up there in Toronto, Canada. They asked for a brief description of Hellfire OG. Here
[05:50.580 --> 05:55.580]  is what I call a brief description. One thing I should mention before I get too far into
[05:55.580 --> 06:00.300]  this is I have been notified and I am aware that there is another breeder who is using
[06:00.300 --> 06:06.620]  the name Hellfire OG. Honestly, I think that breeder may have had it first. I apologize.
[06:06.860 --> 06:12.100]  I fucked up. I guess I didn't do my proper research and do my due diligence as a breeder
[06:12.100 --> 06:16.780]  who releases seeds for commercial purposes. I fucked up. That was my fault. That's not
[06:16.780 --> 06:21.260]  cool. I should not have done that. I let that seed strain out. A lot of people bought it.
[06:21.260 --> 06:25.020]  A lot of people grew it. They posted pictures of it. They tagged it Hellfire OG. The other
[06:25.020 --> 06:29.700]  breeder went, hey motherfucker, that's my strain name. I went, oh fuck, I'm sorry.
[06:29.700 --> 06:33.860]  The people that bought Hellfire OG, you got really lucky because I am not going to make
[06:33.860 --> 06:38.660]  any more. I have gotten rid of the female plant that I use. I have discontinued that
[06:38.660 --> 06:43.060]  cross. I am not making any more of those seeds so that I don't fuck with that guy's other
[06:43.060 --> 06:46.860]  product. I don't want to change the name of it. That's rude. That feels strange. That
[06:46.860 --> 06:51.900]  also feels shifty. So it's a limited batch. What I made is made. A lot of it is already
[06:51.900 --> 06:57.580]  gone. There are very few packs left. I've got very few 10 packs left myself. So it is
[06:57.580 --> 07:01.980]  discontinued. If you've got some, fucking hold onto it or grow it. If you want some,
[07:01.980 --> 07:06.660]  get it quickly because it will be gone very soon and I will not make any more because
[07:06.660 --> 07:10.220]  I stole somebody else's name and that's just straight up wrong. So that is not going to
[07:10.220 --> 07:14.660]  be made anymore. I apologize. If that breeder hears this, bro, I know I did that. I wasn't
[07:14.660 --> 07:18.860]  on purpose. I fucked up. This is what I can do about it. I can stop making it. So let
[07:18.860 --> 07:22.420]  me get off of that soapbox and we'll move forward and actually talk about the strain
[07:22.420 --> 07:30.180]  itself. Why did I call it Hellfire OG? Because it is a cross of Hells OG and Arise. Hells
[07:30.180 --> 07:35.980]  OG is also known as Biker Kush. Hells OG is also known as Hells Angels OG. There was
[07:35.980 --> 07:42.540]  a long story of dispensaries in Colorado having Hells Angels OG on the shelf and the actual
[07:42.540 --> 07:47.660]  Hells Angels organization sent them a letter from their lawyer requesting they change the
[07:47.660 --> 07:52.660]  name. So the Hells Angels OG was no longer called that. It got called either Hells OG
[07:52.660 --> 07:58.220]  or Biker Kush. So that got spread around. I acquired a clone of the Hells OG from a
[07:58.220 --> 08:03.420]  good friend. I decided that it was an awesome plant, but it could use some improvement.
[08:03.420 --> 08:07.460]  That's why I decided to breed with it. It had many great desirable traits. Also, so
[08:07.460 --> 08:12.340]  does my Arise. So it was kind of like a match made in heaven as a plant breeder, as a seed
[08:12.340 --> 08:16.300]  maker. I see things in certain plants and I go, ooh, if those plants right there bred
[08:16.300 --> 08:20.700]  together, they would make amazing offspring. Most of the time I'm right. I will admit that
[08:20.700 --> 08:25.860]  sometimes I'm wrong as shit and we throw large quantities of seeds away or we feed them to
[08:25.860 --> 08:30.980]  the birds. But most of the time I strike gold with most of my intuition. So let's get
[08:30.980 --> 08:38.060]  my high ass back on track. Hellfire OG is a cross of Hells OG to my Arise male, who
[08:38.060 --> 08:42.860]  is known as King Solomon. When I name a cross, I try to honor the parent strain or keep some
[08:42.860 --> 08:48.060]  of the lineage in the name to make it sort of obvious what the cross came from. So Hellfire
[08:48.060 --> 08:52.900]  was an obvious name for Hells OG to Arise. I also thought about calling it the Phoenix,
[08:52.900 --> 08:57.500]  but I think the Phoenix is already taken. There's also a Steel Pulse song called Earth
[08:57.500 --> 09:02.020]  Crisis and one of the lines he just says, Hellfire. And that's part of where it came
[09:02.020 --> 09:06.500]  from. Also, yes, I listened to a lot of reggae music. I name a lot of my strains after Grateful
[09:06.500 --> 09:10.940]  Dead, after reggae type inspired sort of stuff. So that's where my mind is. That's where my
[09:10.940 --> 09:15.920]  names are coming from. And also, of course, I like cartoons. I've got the TMNT stuff.
[09:15.920 --> 09:21.020]  There are also allegedly maybe some GI Joe named stuff out there. That's where my brain
[09:21.020 --> 09:26.780]  is. And things like Arise and Horizon, those are just one word positive names that look
[09:26.780 --> 09:31.900]  good on packaging and sound nice and are memorable and words that stick with you and are uplifting
[09:31.900 --> 09:36.780]  words. That's where my name schemes come from. So that's where the name Hellfire OG comes
[09:36.780 --> 09:42.460]  from. It's a Hells OG female to my male Arise, also known as King Solomon.
[09:42.460 --> 09:48.820]  How about a little more info about the Hells OG? That is a cross of OG Kush and Blackberry.
[09:48.820 --> 09:54.980]  When I grew that, I thought it smelled like gas and cushy. I know that sounds very cliche,
[09:54.980 --> 09:59.720]  but it's Hells OG because it smells like OG Kush. It smells straight cushy, like what
[09:59.720 --> 10:04.180]  Kush is supposed to smell like. It's got some pine to it. It's got some dirty feet. It's
[10:04.180 --> 10:11.780]  got a bunch of gas to it. When it grows, it grows rocks. The buds are just straight, dense,
[10:11.780 --> 10:16.300]  hard rocks. And it makes little pine cone type rocks, maybe some golf balls. It is not
[10:16.300 --> 10:21.900]  a huge yielder. That was the problem, in my opinion, with the Hells OG. It put out
[10:21.900 --> 10:28.140]  very high quality product, but it put out stringy, thin plants with not huge buds.
[10:28.140 --> 10:33.600]  I wanted just a better producer. I thought maybe I could carry that aroma and that frost
[10:33.600 --> 10:38.940]  right into the progeny and increase the productivity and the production of that plant, make it
[10:38.940 --> 10:43.540]  a better plant for a commercial environment. And then here's a little bit of info on the
[10:43.540 --> 10:48.620]  father, which was an Arise male. I keep calling him King Solomon. If you listen to my podcast
[10:48.620 --> 10:54.140]  a lot, you know that King Solomon is used in many of my crosses. That is an Arise male.
[10:54.140 --> 11:00.380]  That is a golden goat female pollinated by a Daybreaker male. Daybreaker is Chem D and
[11:00.380 --> 11:06.060]  Joseph OG. So we've got Chem Dog and OG Kush in there to give you that real funky aroma.
[11:06.060 --> 11:10.940]  I took the pollen from that plant. I put it on a golden goat. That created Arise. I selected
[11:10.940 --> 11:16.540]  a very unique male out of that batch of plants, and I have named him King Solomon. I use that
[11:16.540 --> 11:22.620]  as my main stud breeding male. He is a fucking champion. Everything I put pollen on from
[11:22.620 --> 11:28.620]  King Solomon turns into gold. It improves everything I breed it to. It fixes problems.
[11:28.620 --> 11:32.620]  It increases potency and vigor. I think it is a magical plant. That's why I use it so
[11:32.620 --> 11:33.620]  much.
[11:33.620 --> 11:38.220]  So now let's talk a little bit more about this Hellfire OG cross. Like I mentioned earlier,
[11:38.220 --> 11:43.660]  I really enjoyed the aromas and flavors and the buzz of the Hells OG, but it did not live
[11:43.660 --> 11:48.940]  up to expectations and standards for a commercial grow environment. So my goal was to increase
[11:48.940 --> 11:55.180]  the vigor and kind of increase the harvest weight and yields of the Hellfire OG. I wanted
[11:55.180 --> 12:01.620]  to keep the gas and dank and kush skunky tennis ball flavors and aromas in that cross, and
[12:01.620 --> 12:08.620]  I feel like I achieved that goal. I get a lot of the fresh tennis ball, fresh tires,
[12:08.620 --> 12:14.540]  kushy, gassy, dirty feet sort of aromas coming from many of the phenotypes. Some of them
[12:14.540 --> 12:20.540]  have a sweet bubble gum, maybe juicy fruit gum or some kind of sweet tropical candy flavor
[12:20.540 --> 12:25.380]  coming from them on the back end after that kushy smell. That's coming from the golden
[12:25.380 --> 12:30.740]  goat side of the Arise. But since we've got so many earthy and kushy flavors, most of
[12:30.740 --> 12:36.660]  them are very dominated by that fuely, earthy kush, fresh tennis ball, maybe some fresh
[12:36.660 --> 12:41.620]  sneakers kind of an aroma. There's a place in California called the Norwalk Indoor Swapmeet,
[12:41.620 --> 12:45.980]  and very few people have probably been there that listen to this show. But I think sometimes
[12:45.980 --> 12:51.820]  some dank weed has a hint of the smell of some of the shoes at the Norwalk Indoor Swapmeet.
[12:51.820 --> 12:57.180]  Allegedly, possibly, some of those boots may have some knockoff Air Jordans and they smell
[12:57.180 --> 13:01.860]  really unique. And that is sort of sometimes what some of this kush smells like. I'll
[13:01.860 --> 13:06.340]  talk about specific phenotypes and stuff like that in a moment, but I want to talk about
[13:06.340 --> 13:12.700]  the buzz that comes from most of the phenotypes from the Hellfire OG. I am a heavy smoker
[13:12.700 --> 13:18.940]  and I like potent cannabis and potent extracts. Most of the time I do smoke concentrates,
[13:18.940 --> 13:22.920]  but if I go to a concert, if I go somewhere, I'll roll up a couple of joints and take those
[13:22.920 --> 13:27.320]  with me so I can enjoy them when I'm out doing whatever I'm doing. I also like to smoke
[13:27.320 --> 13:31.600]  a joint of whatever I just bred. If I breed something new, I grow a bunch of those seeds
[13:31.600 --> 13:35.720]  and then I get to smoke it first. I like to get that first flavor. It's like my work.
[13:35.720 --> 13:39.320]  I want to see what it tastes like. It's like being a chef. I've created this potential
[13:39.320 --> 13:43.280]  masterpiece or a potential disaster, so I've got to stick my finger in there and see what
[13:43.280 --> 13:47.600]  it tastes like so that I can assure that I've got a quality product before I serve it to
[13:47.600 --> 13:50.520]  the world. So the first time I grew out some Hellfire
[13:50.520 --> 13:55.440]  OG, I grew it, I dried it, I cured it, trimmed it up properly. I rolled it up into a big
[13:55.440 --> 13:59.400]  fat joint. I lit it up and everybody went, damn, that smells good. That was the first
[13:59.400 --> 14:02.680]  thing that people say when you light up a joint of some good weed, they go, oh, that
[14:02.680 --> 14:05.720]  smells good. Then I took a couple of puffs off of it and I passed it around the room
[14:05.720 --> 14:10.840]  and it came back and I took a couple of puffs off of it. Then I noticed I'm fucked up. Hellfire
[14:10.840 --> 14:17.360]  OG brings that OG Kush potency that just punches you in the face and I call it time travel
[14:17.400 --> 14:22.480]  weed or tunnel vision weed. This is where the word faded came from, I think. When you
[14:22.480 --> 14:26.680]  used to hear people say, bro, I'm faded. I think they might've smoked some good OG Kush
[14:26.680 --> 14:31.840]  and they might've possibly had some Hellfire OG because you just get faded. Your peripheral
[14:31.840 --> 14:36.360]  vision is gone. You just get tunnel vision. You can only focus on what's right in front
[14:36.360 --> 14:42.040]  of you and you can barely focus on that. So I love that just stoned tunnel vision, just
[14:42.040 --> 14:45.720]  straight to the face. Fucking forgot where my keys are and they're in my pocket. I'm
[14:45.720 --> 14:49.480]  looking for my sunglasses and I'm wearing them still. That's the kind of herb that I
[14:49.480 --> 14:55.080]  love and the Hellfire OG brings that punch to the face potency and I love that in some
[14:55.080 --> 14:59.760]  herb. That good dank flavor and that punch to the face, that is what I was looking for.
[14:59.760 --> 15:05.840]  Quite often when people say, recommend your Kushiest, gaseous strain to me, the Hellfire
[15:05.840 --> 15:11.420]  and the Liberation are the two that I recommend for gas and dank and cushy aromas. So now
[15:11.420 --> 15:14.760]  we know how it smells. We know what it tastes like. We know that you're going to get fucking
[15:14.760 --> 15:19.920]  lit when you smoke it. Now let's talk a little bit about the growing aspects of the Hellfire
[15:19.920 --> 15:25.260]  OG. If we're going to grow this, what should and could we expect from this plant? There
[15:25.260 --> 15:31.000]  are a couple of distinct phenotypes. Most of them unfortunately grow tall and they are
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.640]  quite stretchy. These plants will take off at the beginning of flower, just like any
[15:35.640 --> 15:40.840]  OG Kush, they take off. They tend to get rather tall. You can do some popping and twisting
[15:40.840 --> 15:45.440]  and some lollipopping and maybe some trellis work and that will prevent the stretch, but
[15:45.440 --> 15:50.280]  they will stretch. I'm not one to push products on my podcast, but something that will help
[15:50.280 --> 15:56.500]  you reduce the amount of stretch in the first 21 days of your flowering process is a product
[15:56.500 --> 16:02.160]  called Decision from New Millennium Nutrients. It is a great product. It tells those plants,
[16:02.160 --> 16:06.880]  quit stretching, start flowering. Use that when you initiate flower and it will reduce
[16:06.880 --> 16:11.120]  the stretch. Also, if you do some popping and twisting of the stems, which I'm going
[16:11.120 --> 16:14.840]  to do an episode on very soon, when you do that popping and twisting at the start of
[16:14.840 --> 16:18.560]  flower, the plants don't have the energy to stretch because they're trying to repair their
[16:18.560 --> 16:23.440]  cellular structure that you just broke, which is fine. We want to disrupt that structure
[16:23.440 --> 16:27.720]  so that they build fatter, thicker, more robust stems. Also, they don't stretch as much. We
[16:27.720 --> 16:31.680]  slow down that growth, they get thicker and they don't get taller, which is what we want.
[16:31.680 --> 16:35.460]  So that's a way to prevent that stretch with some of this OG Kush stuff. These plants are
[16:35.500 --> 16:39.740]  going to get tall on you, so be prepared for tall, kind of lanky, stretchy plants with
[16:39.740 --> 16:44.700]  a little bit of stretchy internodal spacing. Don't be worried if they look stretchy. That
[16:44.700 --> 16:51.220]  is just what these plants do. You may see a phenotype that gets gigantic leaves. If
[16:51.220 --> 16:56.180]  you've got a plant with gigantic fan leaves that you could have a nice shady spot underneath
[16:56.180 --> 17:02.580]  on a hot sunny day, if those leaves are continuously droopy, it is not a problem with the plant.
[17:02.580 --> 17:06.860]  The plant is not thirsty, the plant has not had too much light. That is a trait that comes
[17:06.860 --> 17:12.300]  from the daybreaker father. So that is actually the grandfather. It's coming from the daybreaker.
[17:12.300 --> 17:16.580]  Don't worry, don't stress. If you've got big, fat, purple leaves that are droopy, that is
[17:16.580 --> 17:20.220]  just a trait that comes with this plant. Don't be paranoid.
[17:20.220 --> 17:24.620]  And generally that happens with the darker green phenotypes, almost a purple leaf. You'll
[17:24.620 --> 17:28.740]  notice the darker colored leaves may get a little bit droopier on you. This one is fun
[17:28.740 --> 17:32.360]  to grow because it does turn a lot of great colors. It'll get dark green, it'll get purple
[17:32.400 --> 17:36.440]  on you. You may see some oranges in it. You may see some like tints of yellow toward the
[17:36.440 --> 17:38.800]  end. It's kind of neat watching this one change colors.
[17:38.800 --> 17:44.320]  Now the main phenotypes that you will see are what I call the golf ball phenotype. And
[17:44.320 --> 17:49.760]  that is very representative of almost any OG Kush family plant. You're getting a lot
[17:49.760 --> 17:55.480]  of OG Kush in there. You're seeing big, fat golf balls, just fist size golf balls up your
[17:55.480 --> 18:01.200]  stems. It doesn't make long fat colas, but every one of those golf balls is just covered
[18:01.200 --> 18:05.200]  in frosty trichomes. So you're going to get the golf ball phenotype, and then you're going
[18:05.200 --> 18:10.680]  to get the more desirable one, the big cola phenotype. And you will know the difference
[18:10.680 --> 18:14.160]  about four or five weeks into flowering. You'll go, yep, those are golf balls and that's a
[18:14.160 --> 18:17.440]  fucking monster cola. You will be able to tell the difference.
[18:17.440 --> 18:22.560]  Now here's what happens with most cannabis. When you grow the golf ball phenotype, it
[18:22.560 --> 18:27.920]  is going to be covered in trichomes and it's going to taste amazing. The other one doesn't
[18:27.920 --> 18:32.040]  have as much frost, but it tastes just as good. So you've got to make the decision between
[18:32.040 --> 18:38.080]  do I want this super fucking frosty plant or do I want more? Then when it comes to being
[18:38.080 --> 18:42.160]  a connoisseur grower, sometimes that's a hard decision to make. If you're growing for personal
[18:42.160 --> 18:46.600]  use, you probably want that golf ball phenotype. If you're trying to take this to a production
[18:46.600 --> 18:50.880]  facility, if you're a cash cropper, if you're looking to profit in any way, you probably
[18:50.880 --> 18:53.340]  want that big fat cola phenotype.
[18:53.340 --> 18:57.880]  They're both going to have beautiful bag appeal. The only person who is going to notice a difference,
[18:57.880 --> 19:02.320]  on the other end, is the grower, the person trying to pay the bills. One is going to
[19:02.320 --> 19:07.320]  give you quite a bit more product than the other and it will be very obvious. Now sometimes
[19:07.320 --> 19:11.760]  I do see a phenotype that is a little bit squattier and a little bit pointier and that
[19:11.760 --> 19:16.480]  may sound strange, but when you see them lined up, you'll go, that's the squatty pointy one.
[19:16.480 --> 19:22.040]  That short, squatty phenotype, in my opinion, is expressing a lot of golden goat traits.
[19:22.040 --> 19:27.560]  I feel like it is showing a lot of Romulan traits. That one finishes a little bit earlier.
[19:27.560 --> 19:33.640]  Most of the phenotypes are going to finish around 70 days. This Romulan dominant phenotype
[19:33.640 --> 19:40.800]  will finish closer to 60 days. However, it lacks that dank, cushy funk. It is more like
[19:40.800 --> 19:46.520]  a sweet golden goat cush sort of a cross. It is not the most desirable sought after
[19:46.520 --> 19:47.520]  phenotype.
[19:47.520 --> 19:49.800]  But here is something I want to mention that I've been thinking about when it comes to
[19:49.800 --> 19:55.600]  talking about phenotypes and identifying phenotypes for my people who are buying my seeds. I don't
[19:55.600 --> 20:02.760]  want you to seek the phenotypes that I like. I want you to seek the phenotypes which you
[20:02.760 --> 20:07.000]  like. Find the phenotype that grows best in your garden. Find the phenotype that does
[20:07.000 --> 20:12.160]  best for your medical or recreational needs. Find the phenotype that does best for your
[20:12.160 --> 20:18.640]  cash crop needs. Find the one that suits your desires. I prefer the one that is kind of
[20:18.640 --> 20:23.060]  stretchy, the one that makes the golf ball buds that smell like dirty feet and armpits.
[20:23.060 --> 20:26.260]  That's the one I would go for. If you're running a cash crop, you're going to tell
[20:26.260 --> 20:29.700]  me to go fuck myself with that one because you're not going to make any profit. That
[20:29.700 --> 20:33.940]  is the connoisseur head stash plant. You want the other one that makes the big gigantic
[20:33.940 --> 20:34.940]  buds.
[20:34.940 --> 20:40.340]  Oftentimes, I notice the girls really prefer the phenotype that is a little bit sweeter
[20:40.340 --> 20:44.840]  and golden goat dominant. I'm not being sexist towards the women. That is what I've noticed.
[20:44.840 --> 20:49.540]  If I put out multiple jars and I say, take your pick, the ladies will tend to pick the
[20:49.540 --> 20:54.360]  sweeter smelling product most of the time. That is just my observation from paying attention
[20:54.360 --> 20:58.740]  to offering products to different people. That golden goat dominant phenotype is more
[20:58.740 --> 21:00.980]  desirable for the ladies.
[21:00.980 --> 21:05.680]  So when it comes to picking your phenotypes, take my advice on what you can expect. Heed
[21:05.680 --> 21:10.060]  my words on what is coming from those packages and how you can adjust your grow to that sort
[21:10.060 --> 21:14.940]  of thing, but don't seek a phenotype based on my descriptions. Get what you want. That's
[21:14.940 --> 21:18.300]  like me trying to say, bro, you really want to go to this restaurant and get this meal.
[21:18.300 --> 21:22.980]  It's going to be perfect. I'm a vegetarian. You might be a steak eater. If I send you
[21:22.980 --> 21:25.860]  to my favorite restaurant, you're going to leave pissed off and hungry, and I'm going
[21:25.860 --> 21:28.020]  to do the same at your favorite restaurant.
[21:28.020 --> 21:31.740]  So find that phenotype that works best for you. Let me get my high ass back on track
[21:31.740 --> 21:36.580]  here and talk about Hellfire OG a little bit more. Something you can count on with all
[21:36.580 --> 21:42.300]  phenotypes of Hellfire OG is that they are going to want more CalMag. I know that sounds
[21:42.300 --> 21:47.660]  funny. That sounds like a joke. Most of the OG Kush varietals are going to be happier
[21:47.660 --> 21:54.820]  with more CalMag. They want more CalMag. Give them more. Also, this one may go nutrient
[21:54.820 --> 22:00.960]  deficient on you late in flower if you don't feed it properly. So I'm not saying to overdose
[22:00.960 --> 22:05.820]  it early. I'm saying to keep a good eye on it. Instead of tapering off your nutrients
[22:05.820 --> 22:09.620]  toward the end of flower, you may need to ride them out an extra week and make sure
[22:09.620 --> 22:12.220]  this plant does not run out of energy.
[22:12.220 --> 22:17.660]  Now I say this about many of the strains that I breed because King Solomon makes tall plants.
[22:17.660 --> 22:24.700]  I extra mean it with this one. You will need multiple layers of supports when you're growing
[22:24.700 --> 22:31.380]  Hellfire OG. This is a tall, lanky, skinny plant. It's going to need some supports. If
[22:31.380 --> 22:37.500]  you grow it properly, hopefully you need two, maybe three or four layers of trellis net.
[22:37.500 --> 22:42.180]  I would spread it out really far with that first net, spread it really far and wide,
[22:42.180 --> 22:46.300]  then let it grow up into that second net, then flip it into flower and put up a third
[22:46.300 --> 22:51.700]  net because it is going to grow into that third layer of trellis. Be prepared for tall,
[22:51.700 --> 22:58.140]  stretchy plants. Hellfire OG is probably not a plant I would recommend for beginner growers.
[22:58.140 --> 23:03.600]  If you have never grown an OG Kush or Chemdog type varietal, you may want some practice
[23:03.600 --> 23:10.100]  with something a little less finicky than the Hellfire OG. The OG Kush genetics in this
[23:10.100 --> 23:13.940]  plant give you a little bit of a challenge when it comes to growing. There are a lot
[23:13.940 --> 23:19.340]  of things to look out for. Sometimes they don't want as much water as other plants.
[23:19.340 --> 23:24.620]  Sometimes they need a lower pH than your other plants. Like I said a moment ago, Hellfire
[23:24.620 --> 23:30.200]  OG is certainly going to want more cow mag than most of your other plants. I think those
[23:30.200 --> 23:36.140]  things are true for most OG Kush type varietals. You're going to find those things true with
[23:36.140 --> 23:40.740]  almost anything OG. If you haven't grown OG before, it is a special experience. It
[23:40.740 --> 23:45.300]  doesn't grow like most of your other cannabis. They don't want as much water. They get a
[23:45.300 --> 23:50.420]  little bit stretchy. They take a lot more work, but they are very rewarding. There was
[23:50.420 --> 23:55.980]  a time period here in Colorado when all you could find was some type of Kush. Now, I've
[23:55.980 --> 24:00.020]  talked about this on the show before. Unfortunately, during that time period, people were just
[24:00.020 --> 24:06.420]  slapping the words OG and Kush on every strain in the dispensary. You went to the dispensary
[24:06.420 --> 24:10.800]  on Friday before a Kush got super popular, and they had 12 different strains, and none
[24:10.800 --> 24:15.500]  of them had the words OG or Kush in them. Over the weekend, Kush got popular. You went
[24:15.500 --> 24:20.540]  back on Monday, and now they had 12 different Kushes. How the fuck did that happen? I think
[24:20.540 --> 24:25.100]  they just relabeled everything. That does happen, unfortunately, in this industry. Let
[24:25.100 --> 24:30.420]  me get back on track again because this lysergic lemon concentrate has got me fucking rambly.
[24:30.420 --> 24:35.500]  My point is that OG Kush type cultivars are very challenging to grow, but they are very,
[24:35.500 --> 24:40.220]  very rewarding. I tried to take some of the challenge out of the Hell's OG by breeding
[24:40.220 --> 24:45.740]  it to the Arise, but unfortunately, it kept that challenge. I think it is worth the struggle
[24:45.740 --> 24:51.340]  because the final product is very rewarding. The aromas, the flavors, the kick to the face
[24:51.460 --> 24:56.500]  type of a buzz, I think it is all very much worth the extra work you have to put in when
[24:56.500 --> 24:58.060]  you're growing some OG Kush.
[24:58.060 --> 25:02.180]  Now, when I say this part, it sounds like I'm just bragging and making shit up. I would
[25:02.180 --> 25:08.900]  highly recommend extra carbon filters when you're growing Hellfire OG. This is very skunky,
[25:08.900 --> 25:14.340]  very stanky, very fuely. If you're growing in an area where growing is not welcome and
[25:14.340 --> 25:19.580]  accepted, somebody is going to smell your Hellfire OG, and they may talk about it because
[25:19.620 --> 25:24.700]  it is stanky. It is potent. It will make your eyes burn. When I trim it, I'm not sure if
[25:24.700 --> 25:28.780]  it's making me tear up with pride or if it's making my eyes burn because it's so stanky,
[25:28.780 --> 25:32.260]  but it definitely does something to my face while I'm trimming.
[25:32.260 --> 25:36.940]  It is also a finicky plant. You have to keep your cow mag dialed in. You have to keep your
[25:36.940 --> 25:41.660]  vapor pressure deficit proper. These plants don't want a dry environment. They want a
[25:41.660 --> 25:46.980]  little bit of a damp environment. Don't let them get dry in the air, but do let them get
[25:46.980 --> 25:53.100]  dry in the pots. They do not like to be over watered. You will not kill an OG Kush varietal
[25:53.100 --> 25:58.420]  by under watering it. You are much more likely to kill an OG Kush plant by over watering.
[25:58.420 --> 26:02.300]  So keep that in mind when it comes to Kush type varietals.
[26:02.300 --> 26:10.140]  The Hellfire OG also tends to like lower pH, and she also really enjoys kelp type products.
[26:10.140 --> 26:14.860]  I think the kelp really brings out the aromas and the stanky feet flavors from the Hellfire
[26:14.860 --> 26:19.740]  OG that will also help you lower the pH of your nutrient solution. So that works out
[26:19.740 --> 26:25.340]  very well. I often talk about defoliating in a commercial grow and also in a small scale
[26:25.340 --> 26:32.560]  personal grow environment. I do not defoliate the Hellfire OG as heavily. I do remove some
[26:32.560 --> 26:37.480]  of those amazingly large leaves, but I don't take off a lot of leaf because she does not
[26:37.480 --> 26:42.580]  respond well to excessive defoliation. This is one of the rare exceptions in my lineup
[26:42.580 --> 26:47.820]  where I will say, do not defoliate her too heavily. It will piss her off. She makes those
[26:47.820 --> 26:52.640]  gigantic leaves, so you don't have a lot of opportunity for defoliation. If it's bigger
[26:52.640 --> 26:56.620]  than my hand, I tend to pull it off. If it's not much bigger than that, I like to leave
[26:56.620 --> 26:58.620]  it there and just let it grow.
[26:58.620 --> 27:04.500]  Toward the end of the flowering phase, these plants will turn some amazing dark colors.
[27:04.500 --> 27:09.020]  You'll get blacks, you'll get purples, you may see some silvers. I've seen some red and
[27:09.020 --> 27:13.700]  yellows on the leaves before. The colors that come from these plants are very beautiful.
[27:13.700 --> 27:18.220]  If you're a photographer, you'll get those cliche bud shot pictures around weeks five,
[27:18.220 --> 27:21.740]  six, and seven, but around weeks eight and nine when you start flushing and then into
[27:21.740 --> 27:27.460]  week 10, you will have some amazing photo opportunities with some amazing colors.
[27:27.460 --> 27:33.940]  I have also noticed that Hellfire OG appreciates lower temperatures toward the end of flower.
[27:33.940 --> 27:37.540]  Don't go too extreme because you will have big fat buds. You don't want to risk getting
[27:37.540 --> 27:41.740]  powdery mildew, but if you can drop your temperature slowly toward the end of flower
[27:41.740 --> 27:46.220]  and get kind of cold at the end of flower, maybe even reduce the light toward the end
[27:46.220 --> 27:52.260]  of the flowering cycle, also helps speed up and create some density in the Hellfire OG.
[27:52.260 --> 27:56.780]  I think I mentioned before that most phenotypes will take nine to 10 weeks. There are a couple
[27:56.780 --> 28:02.180]  of outliers that do take closer to eight weeks. In my opinion, those are the non-desirable
[28:02.180 --> 28:08.420]  phenotypes. Again, you can reduce that flowering time if you reduce the amount of light hours
[28:08.420 --> 28:13.220]  during the flush cycle. Instead of running 12, 12 or 11, 13, maybe drop it down to 10
[28:13.220 --> 28:17.300]  hours of light. Then a couple of days later, put it down to eight hours of light and then
[28:17.300 --> 28:22.180]  harvest after that. There are tricks you can do to speed up the end cycle. Also add a little
[28:22.180 --> 28:26.700]  bit of density. I don't recommend that 24 or 48 hours of darkness. That's not something
[28:26.700 --> 28:31.700]  I do, but you can reduce the overall amount of darkness that that plant gets every day
[28:31.700 --> 28:35.700]  that will help speed it up. Also, I'm sure you've heard me talk about increasing the
[28:35.700 --> 28:39.740]  light toward the end of the flowering cycle to kind of make your plants beef up. That
[28:39.740 --> 28:43.500]  is something I recommend for more advanced growers who know what to look for and can
[28:43.500 --> 28:47.940]  pay attention to their plants so that if they do experience any problems, they can cut down
[28:47.940 --> 28:52.460]  right away and not have any terrible outcomes. But that is experimentation and that is for
[28:52.460 --> 28:56.980]  you to decide. Do you want to run 12, 12 or 11, 13 all the way through flush all the way
[28:56.980 --> 29:00.940]  to the end? If you're in a commercial grow and you've got multiple tables and multiple
[29:00.940 --> 29:04.460]  cycles in one room, that's what you're going to do. You've got to go 12, 12 all the way
[29:04.460 --> 29:08.460]  through. If you've got the opportunity, maybe you'll cut it down to 10 hours of daylight
[29:08.460 --> 29:12.180]  and have 14 hours of darkness for a couple of days. Maybe you'll kick it down to eight
[29:12.180 --> 29:17.220]  hours of daylight and you'll have 16 hours of darkness just for the last couple of days.
[29:17.220 --> 29:22.580]  Or maybe for the last week to 10 days, you can turn your timer back on to 18, six and
[29:22.580 --> 29:27.140]  try to add on a little bit of bulk there at the end. Those are all experiments that you
[29:27.140 --> 29:32.660]  have to do in your own garden to dial in your grow style, your phenotype and your goals.
[29:32.660 --> 29:35.380]  But those are options that are always there to play with.
[29:35.380 --> 29:38.820]  Holy shit, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I feel like I got on a good ramble
[29:38.820 --> 29:43.820]  for this podcast. I hope we learned a lot about Hellfire OG. Like I said before, I will
[29:43.820 --> 29:49.300]  not be making any more Hellfire OG seeds. So what are made are made. I've only got a
[29:49.300 --> 29:55.660]  few packs left myself. If you are interested, they are available at seedsherenow.com. I
[29:55.660 --> 30:01.660]  also may have a few packs set aside for the Indo Expo. Find me early before they disappear.
[30:01.660 --> 30:06.340]  All right, you guys, I think that covers my strain review for Hellfire OG. I hope you
[30:06.340 --> 30:10.300]  enjoyed that. If you've got any more questions, please send me an email. My email address

[31:15.220 --> 31:18.860]  and put a smile on your face. Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be back in just a few days with fresh
[31:18.980 --> 31:22.700]  new content. I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy Willie's armpit. And until
[31:22.700 --> 31:41.730]  next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[32:00.890 --> 32:07.890]  I smoke the marijuana and get high. Stay above the wicked and fly. When I got problem at home domestically.
[32:07.890 --> 32:22.890]  And my girl she just wanna come with me. I smoke the marijuana and get high. Stay above the wicked and fly.
[32:22.890 --> 32:28.890]  Love is the order of the day, you better find it. I'm a big man, I put my problems behind me.
[32:28.890 --> 32:35.890]  I smoke the marijuana and get high. Stay above the wicked and fly.
[32:35.890 --> 32:42.890]  Cause I'm so confident in myself. There's nothing or no one that could get to me.
[32:42.890 --> 32:49.890]  Not even the damn system solicits properly. Right now I'm very entry and living happily.
[32:49.890 --> 32:56.890]  If those Babylonians mess with us today, the music I play. I smoke my problems away from me.
[32:56.890 --> 33:03.890]  Couple of my friends were just chilling on the corner. Listening to the music from Jamaica to Bahamas.
[33:03.890 --> 33:10.890]  Yeah, we decided to go link the farmer. Need something for the brain? It's the marijuana.
[33:10.890 --> 33:16.890]  Happy as a lark when the good vibes stir up. When the chanting starts you get burned if you corrupt.
[33:16.890 --> 33:23.890]  We smoke all day and still we got the herbs that rub up. Those Babylonians rub.
[33:23.890 --> 33:30.890]  We give thanks for this day we keep the meditation. Music and more music we burn the pagans.
[33:30.890 --> 33:37.890]  No ifs, no buts, no argument. Marijuana is my holy sacrament.
[33:37.890 --> 33:44.890]  I smoke the marijuana and get high. Stay above the wicked and fly.
[33:45.890 --> 33:51.890]  Smoke the marijuana and get high. Give thanks and praise high desire.
[33:51.890 --> 33:58.890]  All when Babylonians going down. Rasta man still request a hundred pound.
[33:58.890 --> 34:05.890]  Blaze up the solace and we boss it around. And if I'm a bar myself I go smoke it alone.
[34:05.890 --> 34:09.890]  We got the spunk to make you drunk. It make you rock. It makes you bounce.
[34:09.890 --> 34:16.890]  We got the diesel to ease you. We got enough for the people. We got the hydra to rise you. Smoke and get wiser.
[34:16.890 --> 34:23.890]  Jalisa for blaze. We smoke in purple haze. Smoke the marijuana and get high.
[34:23.890 --> 34:30.890]  Stay above the wicked and fly. Sometimes the things you need in life may be difficult.
[34:30.890 --> 34:37.890]  Not all the time it's gonna be easy. So we go smoke the marijuana and get high.
[34:37.890 --> 34:44.890]  Stay above the wicked and fly. I'm feeling so very good about myself.
[34:44.890 --> 34:51.890]  Pagans in feeling good well and that's the problem. I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[34:51.890 --> 34:58.890]  Stay above the wicked and fly. And when I got problem at home domestically.
[34:58.890 --> 35:05.890]  And my lady just wanna quarrel with me. I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[35:05.890 --> 35:12.890]  Stay above the wicked and fly. Love is all around the day you gotta find it.
[35:12.890 --> 35:19.890]  I'm a big man and I put my problem behind it. I smoke the marijuana and get high.
