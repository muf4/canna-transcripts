[00:05.950 --> 00:25.360]  All right, here we go.
[00:25.360 --> 00:27.040]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:27.040 --> 00:28.040]  I'm your host.
[00:28.040 --> 00:29.880]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:29.880 --> 00:34.280]  This is episode 730 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:34.280 --> 00:36.700]  I've got a great show lined up for you.
[00:36.700 --> 00:40.560]  Before we get to the main topic of today's podcast, let's do a few shout outs to a few
[00:40.560 --> 00:45.400]  of those great folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:45.400 --> 00:48.120]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[00:52.540 --> 00:53.760]  Room and Roll This Nug.

[00:57.840 --> 00:58.840]  Kenobi.
[00:58.840 --> 01:02.600]  Let's send a big Rasta salute to my friend Noah N. Let's send a big thank you shout out
[01:02.600 --> 01:04.760]  to my buddy ADHD Grower.
[01:04.760 --> 01:07.960]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to Growing Tennessee.

[01:14.780 --> 01:15.780]  by my guacamole.
[01:15.780 --> 01:19.460]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:19.460 --> 01:20.460]  Thank you.
[01:20.460 --> 01:22.460]  Shout out to Grow Man Stan.
[01:22.460 --> 01:27.380]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:27.380 --> 01:31.340]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,

[01:44.740 --> 01:48.980]  make it nice and easy for all of my friends who do want to support the show.
[01:48.980 --> 01:50.940]  Truly you guys, thank you for all of the support.
[01:50.940 --> 01:53.540]  It has been a great couple of months on Patreon.
[01:53.540 --> 01:56.220]  I've added a great coupon code this month for you.
[01:56.220 --> 01:57.220]  So really, thank you.
[01:57.220 --> 01:58.860]  I do appreciate that.
[01:58.860 --> 02:03.780]  Also, I do appreciate all of the response, the love, the support and the encouragement
[02:03.780 --> 02:06.660]  for the previous episode with my buddy Clint.
[02:06.660 --> 02:10.220]  That episode has been out for a couple of days at the time of this recording and everybody
[02:10.220 --> 02:14.060]  seems to be leaving positive comments, positive feedback.
[02:14.060 --> 02:15.260]  The emails have all been great.
[02:15.260 --> 02:16.260]  So thank you.
[02:16.260 --> 02:17.780]  I'm sure Clint is reading the comments.
[02:17.780 --> 02:22.420]  Clint, you're probably watching this fist bump, but fist bump, bro, you did a great
[02:22.420 --> 02:23.420]  job.
[02:23.420 --> 02:24.420]  You're welcome back on the show.
[02:24.420 --> 02:26.140]  Let's get some cool shit for you to talk about.
[02:26.140 --> 02:27.140]  Bring you back.
[02:27.140 --> 02:28.140]  The crowd likes you.
[02:28.140 --> 02:29.140]  You're a good friend.
[02:29.140 --> 02:30.140]  Let's get you on the podcast.
[02:30.140 --> 02:31.140]  All right.
[02:31.140 --> 02:32.140]  Thank you guys for the great feedback.
[02:32.140 --> 02:33.140]  We do appreciate that.
[02:33.140 --> 02:34.500]  Clint does appreciate it.
[02:34.500 --> 02:38.540]  Also, if you've been following along, you may remember that recently I bought myself
[02:38.540 --> 02:39.540]  a new rig.
[02:39.540 --> 02:40.860]  This was recently my birthday.
[02:40.860 --> 02:45.180]  I did allocate a budget for myself to buy a new dab rig for my birthday.
[02:45.180 --> 02:46.500]  I bought a whole new setup.
[02:46.500 --> 02:47.500]  I got a dab rig.
[02:47.500 --> 02:48.500]  I got a banger.
[02:48.500 --> 02:49.620]  I got two carb caps.
[02:49.620 --> 02:50.820]  I got some turt pearls.
[02:50.820 --> 02:52.780]  I even got a new torch and a new dabber.
[02:52.780 --> 02:55.460]  I went all the way and I got a nice case for it.
[02:55.460 --> 03:00.380]  Once again, shout out to my friends at Positively Vibes for the sweet hookup on the new rig.
[03:00.380 --> 03:05.660]  Anyway, I did talk about how it was taking me a moment, a few dabs to get everything
[03:05.660 --> 03:10.620]  dialed in, learning the new temperature of the banger, of a brand new banger, learning
[03:10.620 --> 03:15.540]  the when to drop the dab in, when to cap it, just learning the function of a brand new
[03:15.540 --> 03:17.020]  rig and getting the right equipment.
[03:17.020 --> 03:18.180]  It took me a moment.
[03:18.180 --> 03:23.100]  It took me a couple of days, maybe three or four days to get everything purchased, ordered,
[03:23.100 --> 03:27.420]  arrived, cleaned up and in use and in action and test it and see what I like the best.
[03:27.420 --> 03:31.540]  I'm happy to announce that I have got my new dab rig dialed in.
[03:31.540 --> 03:32.580]  It hits like a champ.
[03:32.580 --> 03:35.820]  It hits like a fucking Mack truck running at a hundred miles an hour.
[03:35.820 --> 03:38.700]  It has knocked me on my ass a couple of times this week.
[03:38.700 --> 03:41.500]  I am happy to announce that rig works.
[03:41.500 --> 03:45.580]  So big shout out to my friends at Positively Vibes for making sure I got the perfect rig.
[03:45.580 --> 03:49.260]  Also big shout out to my shopping buddy, the person that went with me that day to make
[03:49.260 --> 03:52.340]  sure I had a great birthday and a great shopping experience.
[03:52.340 --> 03:53.340]  Thank you.
[03:53.340 --> 03:54.340]  That was a great day.
[03:54.340 --> 03:55.820]  Where do we go from there?
[03:55.820 --> 03:59.960]  Let's segue into a little bit more cannabis related content.
[03:59.960 --> 04:04.920]  One of the things I wanted to talk about on this episode was simply be careful on social
[04:04.920 --> 04:05.920]  media.
[04:05.920 --> 04:11.240]  I have noticed that there are several Instagram accounts that are mimicking my Instagram account.
[04:11.240 --> 04:13.640]  I am irie underscore genetics.
[04:13.640 --> 04:14.640]  That is me.
[04:14.640 --> 04:15.880]  That's the only account that I'm using.
[04:15.880 --> 04:17.960]  There is the grow from your heart podcast account.
[04:17.960 --> 04:19.440]  There is the Rasta Jeff account.
[04:19.440 --> 04:23.520]  I rarely log into those just once in a while when I realize I've got so many messages I
[04:23.520 --> 04:24.580]  should check.
[04:24.580 --> 04:26.000]  Don't check those very often.
[04:26.000 --> 04:27.960]  I am irie underscore genetics.
[04:27.960 --> 04:29.480]  I am not the other accounts.
[04:29.480 --> 04:31.280]  I'm not irie dot genetics.
[04:31.280 --> 04:35.720]  I'm not irie genetic dot S. I'm none of those accounts.
[04:35.720 --> 04:39.840]  Those accounts have been attempting to sell seeds to people on Instagram.
[04:39.840 --> 04:41.160]  I do not do that.
[04:41.160 --> 04:42.520]  Don't fall for the scam.
[04:42.520 --> 04:44.860]  Be very careful.
[04:44.860 --> 04:47.840]  Also one of the things I wanted to talk about, somebody was telling me that they take great
[04:47.840 --> 04:49.040]  photos.
[04:49.040 --> 04:52.440]  They're a great grower, but they are afraid to post because of their location and their
[04:52.440 --> 04:55.420]  legality and they don't really want their face out there.
[04:55.420 --> 04:57.420]  They just wanted their plants to be seen.
[04:57.420 --> 04:59.820]  My advice to them was just don't post bro.
[04:59.820 --> 05:03.460]  If you really are that worried about it, if you're that sketched out about it, there's
[05:03.460 --> 05:04.460]  no need to post.
[05:04.460 --> 05:07.500]  If you're not going to put your face on there, if you're not going to link up with people
[05:07.500 --> 05:10.800]  and do business through the Instagram, which I don't recommend anyway, that's a good way
[05:10.800 --> 05:11.800]  to get robbed.
[05:11.800 --> 05:12.800]  That's a good way to get your money taken.
[05:12.800 --> 05:16.060]  If you're the buyer, the seller, it will go wrong for you if you're doing drug deals on
[05:16.060 --> 05:17.100]  Instagram.
[05:17.100 --> 05:20.940]  But if you're not trying to do something where you need to be known, remain anonymous, remain
[05:20.940 --> 05:21.940]  in the shadows.
[05:21.940 --> 05:27.620]  is a free market grower allegedly and nothing he does gets left behind.
[05:27.620 --> 05:28.620]  It all goes somewhere.
[05:28.620 --> 05:30.460]  So I was like, bro, don't even post to social media.
[05:30.460 --> 05:33.020]  There's no need to open up that Pandora's box.
[05:33.020 --> 05:35.340]  If you're not out there, don't be out there.
[05:35.340 --> 05:37.700]  So be careful on social media.
[05:37.700 --> 05:42.260]  One of the things I wanted to segue into was that our phones do put a lot of data in our
[05:42.260 --> 05:46.580]  photos when we take a picture of something with our iPhone, with our any phone we're
[05:46.580 --> 05:47.780]  using basically now.
[05:47.780 --> 05:48.820]  Also our cameras will do it.
[05:48.820 --> 05:52.580]  I've got a high quality camera that tells me exactly where I was, my coordinates.
[05:52.580 --> 05:56.260]  When I took that photo, your phone is marking down exactly where you are.
[05:56.260 --> 06:00.020]  When you take that photo, you can go and if you open up your photos and you search on
[06:00.020 --> 06:04.060]  the map section in your photos, you can search via the map and you can see locations where
[06:04.060 --> 06:05.300]  photos were taken.
[06:05.300 --> 06:06.300]  I live in Pueblo.
[06:06.300 --> 06:07.300]  I can click on Pueblo.
[06:07.300 --> 06:08.740]  It shows all the pictures I took here.
[06:08.740 --> 06:09.740]  I go to Denver a lot.
[06:09.740 --> 06:13.340]  I can see all the pictures I took in Denver, all the pictures I took in Boulder, all the
[06:13.340 --> 06:16.580]  pictures I took in California, all the pictures I took in Oklahoma.
[06:16.580 --> 06:18.500]  I can see them all by category.
[06:18.500 --> 06:23.460]  All of my Meow Wolf pictures are already organized into a folder and I did not do it.
[06:23.460 --> 06:24.600]  The phone did that.
[06:24.600 --> 06:25.900]  It knew I was at Meow Wolf.
[06:25.900 --> 06:30.340]  So be careful when you're taking pictures because that data is stored in your phone.
[06:30.340 --> 06:33.700]  I don't know what you're going to do with that photo once you have taken it.
[06:33.700 --> 06:38.420]  I don't know how much of that data travels with that photo when you post it, but that
[06:38.420 --> 06:39.620]  data is in your phone.
[06:39.620 --> 06:40.620]  That data is there.
[06:40.620 --> 06:44.940]  That picture, the location, the time, the coordinates, it is all right there.
[06:44.940 --> 06:49.500]  So if that phone perhaps could land in the wrong hands or that info could land in the
[06:49.500 --> 06:53.620]  wrong hands, it could get you in some sort of trouble, especially if you shouldn't be
[06:53.620 --> 06:56.780]  growing where you're growing, when you're growing, why you're growing.
[06:56.780 --> 06:57.780]  Be very careful.
[06:57.780 --> 07:00.540]  Now, again, I am not the computer expert.
[07:00.540 --> 07:01.780]  I don't know about this part.
[07:01.780 --> 07:06.180]  I don't know how much comes along with that photo when you post it.
[07:06.180 --> 07:08.220]  I don't know if Instagram gets the metadata.
[07:08.220 --> 07:10.260]  I don't know if Facebook gets that data.
[07:10.260 --> 07:11.820]  I don't know if Cannabis gets that data.
[07:11.820 --> 07:15.620]  I don't know if any of those servers where we share our info, where we share the photos,
[07:15.620 --> 07:18.740]  I don't know if they get the data that is attached to that photo.
[07:18.740 --> 07:22.460]  With the new photos app on the iPhone, you can actually click on the photo and you can
[07:22.460 --> 07:23.460]  see all of the data.
[07:23.460 --> 07:25.980]  I can see the location, the time.
[07:25.980 --> 07:30.020]  I can see what settings my camera was on when I took the photo.
[07:30.020 --> 07:34.660]  If I dig deeper, I can probably see how far the subject was away, what my aperture setting
[07:34.660 --> 07:35.660]  was.
[07:35.660 --> 07:38.460]  I can tell a lot of stuff just digging into the phone just a little bit.
[07:38.460 --> 07:39.460]  That can be sketchy.
[07:39.460 --> 07:40.980]  So be very careful, you guys.
[07:41.140 --> 07:44.500]  If you're going to take pictures with your phone, if you're going to post stuff, be very
[07:44.500 --> 07:45.500]  careful.
[07:45.500 --> 07:47.100]  There's a lot of data hidden.
[07:47.100 --> 07:50.260]  Also, not all accounts are your friends.
[07:50.260 --> 07:53.420]  I mentioned there are fake accounts of my brand, iRegenetics.
[07:53.420 --> 07:56.980]  There are fake accounts of a lot of my friends' brands out there.
[07:56.980 --> 07:57.980]  Be very careful.
[07:57.980 --> 07:59.980]  Also, a lot of those people aren't real people.
[07:59.980 --> 08:04.420]  What would it take for law enforcement just to make an account that said my name is whoever
[08:04.420 --> 08:07.980]  they wanted to be with a cool, catchy name and just jump into the community?
[08:07.980 --> 08:10.020]  They could cause you problems if they wanted to.
[08:10.060 --> 08:13.060]  So be very careful on social media.
[08:13.060 --> 08:16.780]  All of the other accounts that are not iRegenetics are not me.
[08:16.780 --> 08:17.820]  So be careful.
[08:17.820 --> 08:19.340]  Be careful with email addresses.
[08:19.340 --> 08:20.860]  Be careful with websites.
[08:20.860 --> 08:21.860]  Be very careful.
[08:21.860 --> 08:24.620]  Also, be very careful where you are purchasing your seeds.
[08:24.620 --> 08:28.500]  I highly recommend you check my website, iRegenetics.com.
[08:28.500 --> 08:29.560]  That's official.
[08:29.560 --> 08:31.020]  Or go to my Discord.
[08:31.020 --> 08:33.560]  Look for a link that will send you to my official vendors.
[08:33.560 --> 08:36.220]  There are somewhere between eight and 12 vendors.
[08:36.220 --> 08:37.620]  I don't remember what we've got up there now.
[08:37.620 --> 08:39.980]  We're going to do some editing soon, some shifting.
[08:39.980 --> 08:42.580]  But my website has a list of official vendors.
[08:42.580 --> 08:45.940]  Those people do have actual iRegenetics beans.
[08:45.940 --> 08:46.940]  They've been approved.
[08:46.940 --> 08:48.540]  I do know they're selling you good shit.
[08:48.540 --> 08:50.180]  Those companies have good customer service.
[08:50.180 --> 08:51.180]  They're reliable.
[08:51.180 --> 08:55.660]  If you're buying from anybody else, I can't make you any promises on what they are.
[08:55.660 --> 08:57.820]  I can back up Dave.
[08:57.820 --> 08:59.280]  Dave's not here is a good dude.
[08:59.280 --> 09:01.460]  Those are actually iRegenetics beans.
[09:01.460 --> 09:05.100]  There are a few other people that I may be able to vouch for, but if they're not on the
[09:05.100 --> 09:08.580]  website and I don't say their name out loud at least a couple of times, I might not know
[09:08.580 --> 09:09.580]  who they are.
[09:09.580 --> 09:11.060]  I might not be selling my real seeds.
[09:11.060 --> 09:14.860]  There are a couple of brands, a couple of companies out there that just buy buckets
[09:14.860 --> 09:19.060]  of random seeds, put them in labels and tell you that they're my brand and sell them to
[09:19.060 --> 09:20.060]  you.
[09:20.060 --> 09:22.160]  They do it to a lot of other famous popular brands.
[09:22.160 --> 09:23.200]  So be careful out there.
[09:23.200 --> 09:27.260]  Be careful where you are purchasing your seeds.
[09:27.260 --> 09:28.380]  I have a correction to make.
[09:28.380 --> 09:32.220]  In a previous episode, I was talking about auto flower seeds.
[09:32.220 --> 09:33.220]  I talked about Daz.
[09:33.220 --> 09:34.220]  Yeah, that was a quick segue.
[09:34.220 --> 09:35.220]  I'm sorry if I lost you.
[09:35.220 --> 09:36.500]  I was on a previous episode.
[09:36.500 --> 09:42.380]  I was talking about Daz making auto flower seeds with some iRegenetics lines.
[09:42.380 --> 09:47.940]  In that episode, I mentioned that to the best of my knowledge, it takes approximately five
[09:47.940 --> 09:52.140]  or six filial generations to create an auto flower line.
[09:52.140 --> 09:56.180]  Well, after conversation with Daz, I realized I'm wrong as shit and I don't know what I'm
[09:56.180 --> 09:58.660]  talking about when it comes to auto flowers, which is fine with me.
[09:58.660 --> 09:59.940]  I've admitted that.
[09:59.940 --> 10:00.940]  That's not what I'm into.
[10:00.940 --> 10:05.660]  Daz says he can make auto flowers by the third generation.
[10:05.660 --> 10:06.660]  They'll be solid auto.
[10:06.660 --> 10:08.060]  It'll start popping up in the second.
[10:08.060 --> 10:10.820]  It'll be locked in by the third, by that fourth generation.
[10:10.820 --> 10:12.780]  They're definitely auto flowers.
[10:12.780 --> 10:17.800]  So I needed to correct that because I misspoke in a previous episode.
[10:17.800 --> 10:22.180]  Another thing I should mention is in a previous episode, I mentioned that Seeds Here Now was
[10:22.180 --> 10:25.020]  getting a restock of seeds.
[10:25.020 --> 10:29.920]  The United States Postal Service is taking their sweet fucking time with those boxes.
[10:29.920 --> 10:35.200]  So those packages have not arrived at seedsherenow.com at the time of this recording.
[10:35.200 --> 10:36.360]  They're still in transit.
[10:36.360 --> 10:38.640]  So I do ask you, my friends, please be polite.
[10:38.640 --> 10:40.560]  Please be gentle with Seeds Here Now.
[10:40.560 --> 10:41.560]  Be patient with them.
[10:41.560 --> 10:42.880]  The order is on the way.
[10:42.880 --> 10:43.880]  It will get there.
[10:43.880 --> 10:45.200]  It takes them a few minutes to check that in.
[10:45.200 --> 10:46.340]  There is some work to be done.
[10:46.340 --> 10:48.320]  It doesn't just get checked in and sold.
[10:48.320 --> 10:51.320]  There's inventory, things to be counted, shit like that.
[10:51.320 --> 10:52.320]  Give my friends a minute.
[10:52.320 --> 10:54.240]  They do want to sell you the seeds.
[10:54.240 --> 10:56.340]  Nobody makes money with seeds sitting in boxes.
[10:56.340 --> 10:59.120]  They do want to sell them as soon as they've got the seeds available.
[10:59.120 --> 11:00.480]  Nobody will take your money.
[11:00.480 --> 11:04.040]  But please, maybe I spoke too soon saying that they were going there because a lot of
[11:04.040 --> 11:07.080]  people messaged saying we want them now.
[11:07.080 --> 11:08.800]  Sorry guys, not there now.
[11:08.800 --> 11:09.800]  Wait patiently.
[11:09.800 --> 11:10.800]  They will get there.
[11:10.800 --> 11:14.840]  There's a lot going and we're going to do our best to not run out as frequently.
[11:14.840 --> 11:18.040]  We've got some things in place, making some upgrades and some changes.
[11:18.040 --> 11:20.120]  So be patient with my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[11:20.120 --> 11:25.120]  If they don't have what you want in stock, that was harder to say than it looked, just
[11:25.120 --> 11:26.120]  wait a little bit.
[11:26.120 --> 11:27.120]  They will get it.
[11:27.120 --> 11:28.120]  It's on the way.
[11:28.120 --> 11:30.840]  If they still don't, when they do get the restock, if the pack you're looking for didn't
[11:30.840 --> 11:32.560]  get stocked, message me.
[11:32.560 --> 11:34.480]  I'll add that to my list and replenish them.
[11:34.480 --> 11:35.480]  Get that over there.
[11:35.480 --> 11:38.120]  Where do we go from here?
[11:38.120 --> 11:39.760]  I am making selections.
[11:39.760 --> 11:45.320]  Today I made selections for the outdoor breeding run, which will happen this summer.
[11:45.320 --> 11:49.900]  No, I'm not going to tell you what I selected, but I am very excited to have made selections
[11:49.900 --> 11:54.700]  to put in the outdoor breeding run this summer, fall season.
[11:54.700 --> 11:55.700]  I am stoked.
[11:55.700 --> 11:56.700]  I'll leak some info.
[11:56.820 --> 11:59.140]  I'll let you guys know what's going on in the near future.
[11:59.140 --> 12:04.500]  But I wanted to say that I'm super excited to have the outdoor plants prepared for the
[12:04.500 --> 12:05.500]  summer.
[12:05.500 --> 12:09.860]  And speaking of seeds, the Feminized Seed Project is working.
[12:09.860 --> 12:10.860]  That's right.
[12:10.860 --> 12:15.300]  If you've been following along, you know that recently I made a batch of silver thiosulfate
[12:15.300 --> 12:20.180]  spray, which I used to reverse three female golden goat plants.
[12:20.180 --> 12:24.900]  Those three golden goat plants will be used to pollinate a lemon skunk and a platinum
[12:24.900 --> 12:27.220]  tangy and of course another golden goat.
[12:27.220 --> 12:31.260]  Also several other female plants in the room that don't need to be mentioned right now.
[12:31.260 --> 12:34.660]  But my point is that the reversal is working.
[12:34.660 --> 12:37.300]  That female plant is starting to make pollen sacks.
[12:37.300 --> 12:38.620]  I see the male parts on there.
[12:38.620 --> 12:39.820]  They're developing.
[12:39.820 --> 12:40.820]  The balls are nice and big.
[12:40.820 --> 12:44.980]  They're turning purple, doing exactly what I want that golden goat plant to do at this
[12:44.980 --> 12:47.340]  phase at this time, at this stage.
[12:47.340 --> 12:51.060]  The pollen receiver plants have been dragged into the room.
[12:51.060 --> 12:52.500]  They are now kicking into flower.
[12:52.500 --> 12:55.740]  They're not too far in there, but they're starting to show me pre-flower.
[12:55.740 --> 12:58.540]  The Feminized Project is well underway.
[12:58.540 --> 13:02.100]  So here in, I don't want to say a timeframe because you guys will hold me too closely
[13:02.100 --> 13:03.100]  to it.
[13:03.100 --> 13:06.900]  I may need a few days worth of leeway, some time here, some, uh, some buffer zone.
[13:06.900 --> 13:07.900]  What's it called?
[13:07.900 --> 13:08.900]  A grace period.
[13:08.900 --> 13:09.900]  That's the word I'm trying to think of.
[13:09.900 --> 13:10.900]  I may need a brief grace period.
[13:10.900 --> 13:15.820]  However, the lemon Jeffrey, orange chasm, golden goat feminized, and many more fem seeds
[13:15.820 --> 13:19.620]  will be restocked here in a short time.
[13:19.620 --> 13:23.180]  Once again, short time to a breeder is not as much time.
[13:23.180 --> 13:25.820]  You guys are going to think it's been a long time, so be patient with me.
[13:25.820 --> 13:26.820]  They're coming.
[13:26.820 --> 13:27.820]  That's my point.
[13:27.820 --> 13:28.820]  Fem seeds are coming.
[13:28.820 --> 13:30.580]  Uh, the reversal is looking good.
[13:30.580 --> 13:36.500]  The golden goat that I sprayed every third day for up to day 21 at 70% dilution is the
[13:36.500 --> 13:38.740]  one that made, uh, that will make the most pollen.
[13:38.740 --> 13:42.740]  It looks like in my opinion, uh, so far from what it looks like with my observations, but
[13:42.740 --> 13:45.820]  that is the one that appears to be ready to make the most pollen.
[13:45.820 --> 13:46.820]  It worked.
[13:46.820 --> 13:47.820]  The silver was perfect.
[13:47.820 --> 13:48.820]  That's my opinion.
[13:48.820 --> 13:50.180]  I did the mix just right.
[13:50.180 --> 13:51.180]  Spray just right.
[13:51.180 --> 13:54.940]  I'm excited to get the fem seeds made for you guys because you guys have been asking
[13:54.940 --> 13:56.380]  for them for a long time.
[13:56.380 --> 13:57.820]  Uh, there are other fans.
[13:57.820 --> 14:00.740]  You guys, there are other fans that will be dropping very soon.
[14:00.740 --> 14:06.140]  I may not have said it on the show, but the afterglow S one will be available at seeds
[14:06.140 --> 14:07.140]  here now.
[14:07.140 --> 14:08.140]  Dot com.
[14:08.140 --> 14:09.660]  All right, where do we go from here?
[14:09.660 --> 14:12.940]  I've got one more long part that I want to ramble about in this podcast.
[14:12.940 --> 14:15.860]  Then we will wrap it up, go take some dabs and have a party.
[14:15.860 --> 14:19.460]  I was talking with a friend recently at an event and we were talking about setting up
[14:19.460 --> 14:20.820]  a brand new grow.
[14:20.820 --> 14:26.060]  And as I was mentioning the parts, the needs, the components, uh, the instructions and details
[14:26.060 --> 14:29.860]  of a grow, I could watch my friend's eyes kind of turn into the back of their head and
[14:29.860 --> 14:30.860]  their face glazed over.
[14:30.860 --> 14:33.740]  And I saw them check out and I was like, you good bro.
[14:33.740 --> 14:36.700]  And he's like, I can't afford half of the shit that you just mentioned.
[14:36.700 --> 14:38.540]  I don't have half that much time.
[14:38.540 --> 14:42.380]  And then I thought, you know, it shouldn't intimidate you.
[14:42.380 --> 14:48.780]  What I'm saying is how you grow top shelf, a cup winning, a medical grade, perfect weed.
[14:48.780 --> 14:51.940]  This is the best weed you can grow with all of these details.
[14:51.940 --> 14:56.880]  You don't have to start off growing cup winning championship weed.
[14:56.880 --> 14:59.820]  You should not start off growing cup winning championship weed.
[14:59.820 --> 15:01.340]  Nobody starts off as a black belt.
[15:01.340 --> 15:03.080]  Nobody starts off as a master.
[15:03.080 --> 15:05.940]  You've got to start off as a white belt in any craft in which you start.
[15:05.940 --> 15:09.060]  You got to be a beginner or you're going to fail later on.
[15:09.060 --> 15:12.700]  If you don't start off as a beginner, learn the basic steps, the fundamentals, you'll
[15:12.700 --> 15:15.100]  never get truly good at anything.
[15:15.100 --> 15:19.700]  So sometimes when I'm talking about all of the things that are needed to grow good cannabis,
[15:19.700 --> 15:23.180]  sometimes when I'm talking about all of the equipment, the nutrients, the purchases, the
[15:23.180 --> 15:27.560]  cost of entry, the time that it's going to require, the modifications and or adjustments
[15:27.560 --> 15:35.580]  to your home, that is for top shelf, grade A award winning, best cannabis you could possibly
[15:35.580 --> 15:36.620]  consume.
[15:36.620 --> 15:42.980]  You can grow some cannabis that you can smoke and enjoy with very minimal equipment, cost,
[15:42.980 --> 15:49.100]  setup, time, effort, the time, effort, energy, and equipment that you've got will produce
[15:49.100 --> 15:50.100]  cannabis.
[15:50.100 --> 15:52.500]  It may not be the way that I describe it.
[15:52.500 --> 15:54.280]  You can put a lot of effort into it.
[15:54.280 --> 15:55.340]  So think about it this way.
[15:55.340 --> 15:58.300]  I'm six five and I weigh about 190 pounds.
[15:58.300 --> 15:59.500]  I am super skinny.
[15:59.500 --> 16:02.340]  I obviously don't put a lot of time into beefing up.
[16:02.340 --> 16:03.340]  I'm not getting bulky.
[16:03.340 --> 16:04.420]  I got cardio for days.
[16:04.420 --> 16:06.140]  I'm strong enough for what I need to do.
[16:06.160 --> 16:07.500]  I don't want to get big and bulky.
[16:07.500 --> 16:08.500]  That's just not for me.
[16:08.500 --> 16:10.540]  Maybe one day, but that's never been a thing on my brain.
[16:10.540 --> 16:11.540]  I don't need to be huge.
[16:11.540 --> 16:13.420]  But then you look at Brock Lesnar, right?
[16:13.420 --> 16:14.780]  There's Brock Lesnar.
[16:14.780 --> 16:18.180]  Brock Lesnar puts a lot of time into being a big fucking dude.
[16:18.180 --> 16:22.540]  If let's just say that we are going for elite muscular body types.
[16:22.540 --> 16:25.620]  If you are looking to win awards, you got to work out.
[16:25.620 --> 16:29.540]  You got to fucking take the steroids, do the pushups, eat the protein, get the diet plan
[16:29.540 --> 16:30.540]  going.
[16:30.540 --> 16:31.700]  You got to get it all fucking in line.
[16:31.700 --> 16:35.780]  If you want to look like Brock Lesnar, if you want the plants that look like Brock Lesnar
[16:35.940 --> 16:40.420]  plants, you need all of the nutrients, all the equipment, the best lights, the best seeds,
[16:40.420 --> 16:41.540]  the best soil.
[16:41.540 --> 16:45.700]  You also have to be in that grow space twice a day, checking on everything, making sure
[16:45.700 --> 16:51.140]  that everything is fed, making sure that every leaf that needs to be defoliated is defoliated,
[16:51.140 --> 16:55.300]  making sure that the stems and sticks are popped and twisted and everything's lollipopped.
[16:55.300 --> 16:57.420]  And if you're trellising, it's trellised correctly.
[16:57.420 --> 16:58.420]  You're in there twice a day.
[16:58.420 --> 16:59.740]  You're in there right when the lights come on.
[16:59.740 --> 17:03.100]  And then once again, right before the lights go off, you're in there doing work every single
[17:03.100 --> 17:04.300]  day.
[17:04.300 --> 17:07.860]  Or if you want to, you could grow some plants that look like me.
[17:07.860 --> 17:11.220]  They're tall, they're skinny, they're lanky, but they'll get the job done at the end of
[17:11.220 --> 17:12.220]  the day.
[17:12.220 --> 17:14.820]  You didn't have to spend a whole bunch of time in the gym, a whole bunch of time on
[17:14.820 --> 17:17.620]  a diet plan and you'll accomplish the goal.
[17:17.620 --> 17:20.900]  But when you stand next to each other, you'll go, that dude right there obviously spent
[17:20.900 --> 17:24.740]  more fucking time in the gym and that guy was playing video games or recording podcasts
[17:24.740 --> 17:25.980]  or some shit over there.
[17:25.980 --> 17:27.820]  Definitely not in the gym lifting weights.
[17:27.820 --> 17:29.100]  That's definitely not me.
[17:29.100 --> 17:30.980]  You can see that and you'll see that in the grow.
[17:31.300 --> 17:36.220]  Now, with that being said, I don't want you to start off being the best grower ever.
[17:36.220 --> 17:40.700]  I want you to start off with the equipment you can afford in the space that you can afford
[17:40.700 --> 17:44.660]  with the best light and the best genetics you can afford and then piece it together
[17:44.660 --> 17:45.660]  after that.
[17:45.660 --> 17:47.980]  Figure out how to control the light cycle in the room.
[17:47.980 --> 17:52.140]  Once you've got a space where you can control the light cycle, now you can focus on putting
[17:52.140 --> 17:56.180]  a light in there, putting some seeds in there, putting all of the better equipment in there.
[17:56.180 --> 18:00.820]  Then you grow a couple of crops, read a few books before you grow anything, read a book.
[18:00.820 --> 18:03.780]  And as you grow, you'll experience problems and you'll see things, you'll see things you
[18:03.780 --> 18:05.220]  want to improve on.
[18:05.220 --> 18:08.340]  Keep reading more books, watch more podcasts, learn things.
[18:08.340 --> 18:13.660]  But just like any hobby, most, most people don't have the advantage, the blessing, the,
[18:13.660 --> 18:17.940]  uh, well, they just don't have the funding to go out and buy the best equipment for a
[18:17.940 --> 18:18.940]  brand new hobby.
[18:18.940 --> 18:21.820]  If you're going to start karate, if you're going to buy the drums, if you're going to
[18:21.820 --> 18:25.580]  buy baseball equipment, if you're going to get into hockey, if you're going to be a new
[18:25.580 --> 18:31.140]  podcaster, most of us don't have the blessings, the advantage to go and just buy the most
[18:31.140 --> 18:34.140]  expensive best shit, which is what we'd like to do for our grow room.
[18:34.140 --> 18:35.140]  That would be ideal.
[18:35.140 --> 18:38.220]  You just go to the grow store and you say, I want the best light, the best tent, the
[18:38.220 --> 18:43.060]  best fucking dehumidifier, the best soil, best nutrients, hit up Rasta Jeff, get the
[18:43.060 --> 18:45.100]  best genetics, get all the best shit.
[18:45.100 --> 18:46.820]  I understand we can't all do that.
[18:46.820 --> 18:49.380]  All of the best shit costs a lot of money.
[18:49.380 --> 18:53.380]  So get the best light, get a good tent, get a good environment, something in which you
[18:53.380 --> 18:55.540]  can control the light and dark cycles.
[18:55.540 --> 18:58.340]  That's going to be one of the main elements which we need.
[18:58.340 --> 19:01.380]  Then after that, get a good light, then get good genetics.
[19:01.380 --> 19:04.780]  I don't, I'd recommend good seeds, but you can get clones.
[19:04.780 --> 19:05.780]  Clones are tried and true.
[19:05.780 --> 19:07.580]  Maybe your friend grew them, saved you a step already.
[19:07.580 --> 19:11.300]  You know, they're good clones, but maybe also your friend selected some bullshit.
[19:11.300 --> 19:14.220]  Maybe you need to get some seeds and find the good shit, but spend the money on a good
[19:14.220 --> 19:20.140]  enclosure, a good tent, build something somewhere you can control the light, the dark and the
[19:20.140 --> 19:21.140]  environment.
[19:21.140 --> 19:23.940]  Then spend money on a good light, then good genetics.
[19:23.940 --> 19:26.100]  Then from there, everything else will come into place.
[19:26.100 --> 19:31.500]  You're going to need fans, dehumidifier, something to control the climate in the room, some sort
[19:31.500 --> 19:36.040]  of air exchange, a blower, stuff like that, a pH pen, nutrients.
[19:36.040 --> 19:40.180]  All that stuff will come in line, but buy the best light and nutrients that you can
[19:40.180 --> 19:41.620]  get to start off with.
[19:41.620 --> 19:44.460]  Then as you get better, you will buy more things.
[19:44.460 --> 19:48.460]  If you are growing for production, if you're making a profit off of this, how about every
[19:48.460 --> 19:52.980]  time you harvest, you put a good portion of that harvest back into your grow space and
[19:53.020 --> 19:54.220]  into your skill.
[19:54.220 --> 19:59.340]  If you're able to pull a pound of okay weed this time, how about next time we pull a pound
[19:59.340 --> 20:03.780]  and a quarter of even better weed and the next time a pound and a half of even better
[20:03.780 --> 20:08.540]  weed and we work our way up until we're pulling three pounds of light of fucking top shelf,
[20:08.540 --> 20:11.180]  amazing, impressive weed in every grow.
[20:11.180 --> 20:12.380]  This isn't your last grow.
[20:12.380 --> 20:15.580]  This first time when we build this, this is your first grow.
[20:15.580 --> 20:17.540]  This is just the starting run.
[20:17.540 --> 20:20.700]  Get a bike with some training wheels, get a helmet and just start training.
[20:20.700 --> 20:22.580]  You're going to crash a couple of times.
[20:22.580 --> 20:23.820]  Find out if you're even into it.
[20:23.820 --> 20:27.060]  Find out if you can dedicate the time, the energy, the space.
[20:27.060 --> 20:28.060]  It's a commitment.
[20:28.060 --> 20:31.620]  It's like getting a puppy, but at the end of it, you get to smoke it and take some dabs
[20:31.620 --> 20:32.620]  if you do it right.
[20:32.620 --> 20:36.420]  So you're going to have to spend some time, some energy, some love, some money, some adjustments
[20:36.420 --> 20:37.420]  into there.
[20:37.420 --> 20:42.660]  There are some commitments, some sacrifices, some dedication to be put into these plants.
[20:42.660 --> 20:47.540]  So just like any other hobby you start, you don't need to start off with the best equipment.
[20:47.540 --> 20:49.380]  When I got into drumming, I've been playing the drums.
[20:49.380 --> 20:52.980]  I like to use the drums for a good example because I've been playing the drums for over,
[20:52.980 --> 20:55.900]  I don't even want to say how many years I feel old.
[20:55.900 --> 20:59.100]  I've been playing the drums for over 20 years, 25 years.
[20:59.100 --> 21:00.100]  Holy shit.
[21:00.100 --> 21:02.860]  I've had a drum set for over 25 years.
[21:02.860 --> 21:07.020]  When I bought my first drum set, I thought I knew exactly what I wanted.
[21:07.020 --> 21:11.020]  I thought I wanted this here, this here, these things here, this, this thought I wanted these
[21:11.020 --> 21:12.020]  pedals.
[21:12.020 --> 21:15.580]  Now my drum set is nothing like what it was when I designed it.
[21:15.580 --> 21:24.820]  I understand that my body, my physical needs, my skill, my setup for my body and my drums
[21:24.820 --> 21:30.340]  and my budget and my ability, it has all changed and evolved in so many ways that the idea
[21:30.340 --> 21:33.540]  of what I thought I was going to play, how I thought I was going to play, who, where,
[21:33.540 --> 21:36.820]  and when I thought I was going to play with none of that is the same now.
[21:36.820 --> 21:39.620]  So my entire drum set is different.
[21:39.620 --> 21:43.360]  Also my grow spaces have evolved dramatically.
[21:43.360 --> 21:46.280]  They also still continue to evolve seasonally.
[21:46.280 --> 21:48.200]  Every season I change stuff.
[21:48.200 --> 21:52.400]  I've gotten to the point where I can see what's happening to the plants really quickly.
[21:52.400 --> 21:53.760]  I can make changes on the fly.
[21:53.760 --> 21:56.620]  I'm not afraid to make some changes and screw some shit up.
[21:56.620 --> 22:02.760]  So now I try to add or change or subtract or different, adjust, modify, change something
[22:02.760 --> 22:07.840]  almost every run, every other run so that I can see where I can improve or see what
[22:07.840 --> 22:10.360]  products work or see what doesn't work.
[22:10.360 --> 22:15.320]  If you've been following along, you learned that last winter I learned that I should not
[22:15.320 --> 22:18.600]  switch to LEDs right at the beginning of the fucking winter season.
[22:18.600 --> 22:24.000]  I went from my HBSs to brand new LEDs that like a week later was negative 17 degrees
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.000]  outside.
[22:25.000 --> 22:28.000]  There was no way to keep my grow space cold because the HBS lights that I had in there
[22:28.000 --> 22:29.280]  were doing that.
[22:29.280 --> 22:33.440]  So now I've learned to not to switch that shit in the middle, but my grow space is always
[22:33.440 --> 22:38.880]  evolving, ever changing, new ideas, new equipment, just like my drum set, just like your guitar
[22:38.880 --> 22:41.600]  setup, just like your hockey gear, just like whatever you're into.
[22:41.600 --> 22:42.680]  All of our shit evolves.
[22:42.680 --> 22:47.640]  So when you're getting started, don't let all the stuff I talk about intimidate you.
[22:47.640 --> 22:48.920]  I say a lot of things.
[22:48.920 --> 22:56.320]  You need a light, a tent, pots, soil, a dehumidifier, possibly a humidifier, maybe an air conditioner,
[22:56.320 --> 23:02.000]  maybe a heater, definitely some sort of extraction fan to remove humidity and heat from the room.
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.880]  Then maybe a duct to pull fresh air into the room.
[23:04.880 --> 23:06.760]  Then we need some sort of pH monitor.
[23:06.760 --> 23:08.680]  Then we need an EC monitor.
[23:08.680 --> 23:10.360]  Then we need all kinds of mixing equipment.
[23:10.360 --> 23:11.360]  Then we need nutrients.
[23:11.360 --> 23:14.800]  Also, it'd be cool to have a VPD monitor in the room.
[23:14.800 --> 23:16.400]  There are so many things to think about.
[23:16.400 --> 23:19.280]  Then I'd like to add CO2 and a CO2 monitor.
[23:19.280 --> 23:21.080]  Then I want to build an auto watering system.
[23:21.080 --> 23:23.400]  Then I want to do this and then all of this.
[23:23.400 --> 23:27.880]  Then I'm going to talk about trichomes and terpenes and testing numbers and days and
[23:27.880 --> 23:31.360]  durations and fucking productivity of all kinds of things.
[23:31.360 --> 23:32.560]  But guess what?
[23:32.560 --> 23:34.240]  That's just because I've been doing it for a long time.
[23:34.240 --> 23:36.320]  Don't let all that shit intimidate you.
[23:36.360 --> 23:39.640]  Nature grows weed outside every year all the time without us.
[23:39.640 --> 23:43.120]  Nobody gets involved and that shit happens beautifully just the way that whatever you
[23:43.120 --> 23:46.960]  believe in, the way that nature, the way that jaw, the way that Buddha, the way that the
[23:46.960 --> 23:49.920]  flying spaghetti monster intended it to happen.
[23:49.920 --> 23:52.760]  That happens outside so it can definitely happen indoors.
[23:52.760 --> 23:53.920]  Just let it happen.
[23:53.920 --> 23:55.400]  Screw it up as little as you can.
[23:55.400 --> 23:56.400]  Stay out of the way.
[23:56.400 --> 23:58.120]  You don't need all the fancy shit.
[23:58.120 --> 24:01.760]  You can start off with a little bit of shit, build up as you go.
[24:01.760 --> 24:03.240]  I didn't start off with the greatest stuff.
[24:03.240 --> 24:06.240]  I had a little tiny light that kind of flickered sometimes when it came on.
[24:06.240 --> 24:09.080]  It hummed and made a weird noise and I was afraid I was going to burn down the freaking
[24:09.080 --> 24:10.080]  house.
[24:10.080 --> 24:11.400]  I had a little tent that had light leaks.
[24:11.400 --> 24:13.600]  I put duct tape all over the light leaks.
[24:13.600 --> 24:15.880]  I grew two good rounds in that.
[24:15.880 --> 24:17.360]  The first one we smoked all of it.
[24:17.360 --> 24:20.800]  The second run I sold it and made enough money out of that second run.
[24:20.800 --> 24:25.440]  Allegedly, possibly there was medical marijuana then so this was legit maybe possibly sold
[24:25.440 --> 24:31.200]  that second crop and bought another tent that was twice the size and bought another light,
[24:31.400 --> 24:35.520]  bought an air conditioner, bought a blower and had two grow spaces now and turned one
[24:35.520 --> 24:39.440]  into a veg space, one into a flower space, started production.
[24:39.440 --> 24:42.920]  Then every time I would harvest another crop, I would just buy another piece of gear, another
[24:42.920 --> 24:45.440]  piece of gear, a better piece of gear.
[24:45.440 --> 24:46.440]  That piece sucks.
[24:46.440 --> 24:49.580]  Let's buy a new one when we harvest and get another one and just make a wish list.
[24:49.580 --> 24:52.320]  When you harvest, you're going to have some money if you do it right.
[24:52.320 --> 24:55.280]  You're either going to save the money you've been spending on product or you're going to
[24:55.280 --> 24:57.880]  flip some of it and make a profit.
[24:57.880 --> 24:58.880]  Reinvest in your business.
[24:58.880 --> 25:01.640]  Your growth is now your business, your hobby, your passion.
[25:01.640 --> 25:02.640]  Put some money into it.
[25:02.640 --> 25:04.480]  It's going to put some love back into you.
[25:04.480 --> 25:07.160]  Spend some energy, some time, some effort on it and you will learn.
[25:07.160 --> 25:08.160]  You will grow.
[25:08.160 --> 25:09.160]  You will become a great grower.
[25:09.160 --> 25:10.160]  I was a white belt.
[25:10.160 --> 25:11.520]  I was brand new one day.
[25:11.520 --> 25:15.160]  Now I'm here teaching the community how to improve every day.
[25:15.160 --> 25:16.940]  So don't be intimidated.
[25:16.940 --> 25:18.000]  Don't be shy.
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.840]  Don't think that you have to set up the first grow.
[25:19.840 --> 25:21.940]  The first grow should not be a Ferrari.
[25:21.940 --> 25:23.880]  You wouldn't buy your kid a Ferrari for their first car.
[25:23.880 --> 25:26.560]  You get them a Pinto or a Pacer or some shit, right?
[25:26.560 --> 25:27.560]  Get that Pinto.
[25:27.560 --> 25:28.560]  Get that Pacer, bro.
[25:29.240 --> 25:30.240]  Do it a few times.
[25:30.240 --> 25:33.680]  Then get that F1 racer and fucking win the race.
[25:33.680 --> 25:37.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[25:37.920 --> 25:41.520]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there.

[25:51.240 --> 25:52.240]  a few edits.
[25:52.240 --> 25:53.240]  Thank you.
