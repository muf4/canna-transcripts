[00:17.720 --> 00:20.520]  Yeah, what's up ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:20.520 --> 00:23.240]  It's time for episode number 40 of the iGrow Culture podcast.
[00:23.240 --> 00:25.080]  I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[00:25.080 --> 00:26.760]  Joining me at the table again is our good buddy Jesse.
[00:26.760 --> 00:27.760]  How you doing bro?
[00:27.760 --> 00:28.760]  Pretty good.
[00:28.760 --> 00:32.120]  How's it going out there, podcast land?
[00:32.120 --> 00:34.300]  Podcast land, internet world.
[00:34.300 --> 00:36.920]  Hopefully you guys are listening to us while you're driving to work or playing in the garden
[00:36.920 --> 00:39.420]  or doing something fun.
[00:39.420 --> 00:42.960]  Whatever you're doing, I hope you got a dab or a fat joint or a bowl of something super
[00:42.960 --> 00:43.960]  dank.
[00:43.960 --> 00:47.280]  We're smoking some live resin, some bounty killer, or no, not bounty killer.
[00:47.280 --> 00:48.760]  Oh, it is bounty killer live resin.
[00:48.760 --> 00:49.760]  No, it's not.
[00:49.760 --> 00:50.760]  It's Capleton live resin.
[00:50.760 --> 00:51.760]  Sorry, I just lied.
[00:51.760 --> 00:52.760]  It's Capleton live resin.
[00:52.760 --> 00:55.360]  This stuff is tasty.
[00:55.360 --> 00:56.520]  Big shout out to the dude that grew it.
[00:56.520 --> 00:57.520]  What's up Ryan?
[00:57.520 --> 00:58.520]  Nice work.
[00:58.520 --> 01:01.040]  And an extra special shout out to the guy that blasted, extracted it for us.
[01:01.040 --> 01:03.480]  This stuff is super tasty.
[01:03.480 --> 01:08.880]  Who would imagine that the iRegenetics guy would have all those iRegenetics tabs sitting
[01:08.880 --> 01:09.880]  over there?
[01:09.880 --> 01:10.880]  Dude, it's really nice to see-
[01:10.880 --> 01:12.320]  Can't even keep them straight.
[01:12.320 --> 01:13.320]  Yeah, true.
[01:13.320 --> 01:17.640]  It's really nice to watch my friends grow my genetics and then to have one of our good
[01:17.640 --> 01:19.840]  brothers extract it for us.
[01:19.840 --> 01:23.040]  And then he gets his hash back and he calls me, dude, come over and get some of this hash
[01:23.040 --> 01:24.440]  I just had made from your screens.
[01:24.440 --> 01:26.240]  I'm like, hell yeah, I'm on my way.
[01:26.240 --> 01:27.240]  Nice.
[01:27.240 --> 01:29.160]  I got a nice gram of heart of gold.
[01:29.160 --> 01:31.640]  There was grateful dog and there was Capleton live resin.
[01:31.640 --> 01:34.240]  And dude, that was tasty stuff.
[01:34.240 --> 01:38.600]  It left a, I keep saying citronella candles sort of scent in the room.
[01:38.600 --> 01:40.400]  If you're into that, that was a great smell.
[01:41.400 --> 01:44.160]  Guys, I want to take one quick second and give a huge shout out.
[01:44.160 --> 01:47.720]  I always do this at the end of the show, but we got to do a special shout out.
[01:47.720 --> 01:49.720]  Extra special shout out to my ninja Spence.
[01:49.720 --> 01:51.840]  Spence has been sick as hell.
[01:51.840 --> 01:55.440]  We found out just recently that his appendix had ruptured inside of him and he had to have
[01:55.440 --> 01:56.440]  it removed.
[01:56.440 --> 01:59.120]  Dude, I'm so glad you're on the way to recovery.
[01:59.120 --> 02:00.320]  We were super worried about you.
[02:00.320 --> 02:02.240]  I was stressing out, worrying about my brother.
[02:02.240 --> 02:04.200]  I love you more than you ever will realize.
[02:04.200 --> 02:05.840]  So big shout out to Spence, dude.
[02:05.840 --> 02:08.160]  Everybody send your love and energy to getting Spence better.
[02:08.160 --> 02:09.160]  Get better, buddy.
[02:09.160 --> 02:10.160]  Come on, feller.
[02:10.920 --> 02:11.920]  Yeah, buddy.
[02:11.920 --> 02:12.920]  Get up.
[02:12.920 --> 02:13.920]  You got to shoot some hoops.
[02:13.920 --> 02:14.920]  You got to make some hash.
[02:14.920 --> 02:17.200]  Spence is going to win the secret cup finals in Vegas.
[02:17.200 --> 02:18.200]  I'm confident.
[02:18.200 --> 02:19.200]  Minus an appendix.
[02:19.200 --> 02:20.200]  Can he fly cheaper?
[02:20.200 --> 02:21.200]  He just lost some weight.
[02:21.200 --> 02:22.200]  Oh, no shit.
[02:22.200 --> 02:23.200]  Yeah.
[02:23.200 --> 02:24.200]  Isn't your appendix only like about an inch long anyway?
[02:24.200 --> 02:25.200]  Yeah, I actually looked it up today.
[02:25.200 --> 02:26.200]  That thing almost killed him.
[02:26.200 --> 02:27.200]  It almost killed him.
[02:27.200 --> 02:28.200]  I'm pretty sure he was pretty bad shape.
[02:28.200 --> 02:29.200]  And it's almost, it's completely worthless.
[02:29.200 --> 02:30.200]  Somebody asked me, what does your appendix do?
[02:30.200 --> 02:31.200]  And I looked at him and said, I don't know.
[02:31.200 --> 02:32.200]  It's full of a poison.
[02:32.200 --> 02:33.200]  It's full of a poison.
[02:33.200 --> 02:34.200]  It's full of a poison.
[02:34.200 --> 02:35.200]  It's full of a poison.
[02:36.200 --> 02:37.480]  Somebody asked me, what does your appendix do?
[02:37.480 --> 02:39.120]  And I looked at him and said, I don't know.
[02:39.120 --> 02:40.440]  It's full of a poison vial.
[02:40.440 --> 02:41.440]  That's what it does.
[02:41.440 --> 02:42.440]  That's an awesome thing to do.
[02:42.440 --> 02:47.360]  Let's just stick this inside of a human and wait for it to rupture one day.
[02:47.360 --> 02:48.360]  Good job, creator.
[02:48.360 --> 02:51.360]  That's the self-destruct switch he gave us all, I guess.
[02:51.360 --> 02:52.360]  I guess so.
[02:52.360 --> 02:53.360]  Also, override.
[02:53.360 --> 02:56.160]  Since we're sending out love and energy to people that need some help, I want to send
[02:56.160 --> 02:58.520]  a big, huge healing vibe to my good friend, Angela.
[02:58.520 --> 03:00.480]  She hasn't been feeling well the past week.
[03:00.480 --> 03:01.960]  She's got some medical things going on.
[03:01.960 --> 03:04.240]  That's kind of private to her, so we don't need to elaborate.
[03:04.280 --> 03:07.240]  But, dude, send a lot of healing vibes to Angela.
[03:07.240 --> 03:08.240]  Big shout out to Angela.
[03:08.240 --> 03:09.240]  I care a lot about you.
[03:09.240 --> 03:10.240]  I want you better.
[03:10.240 --> 03:11.240]  I want to see you smiling again.
[03:11.240 --> 03:12.240]  Hey, what's up, guys?
[03:12.240 --> 03:13.320]  I have to jump in and do a disclaimer.
[03:13.320 --> 03:16.400]  I played this shout out for Angela, and when she heard it, she said that I made it sound
[03:16.400 --> 03:17.920]  like there's something wrong with her vagina.
[03:17.920 --> 03:23.080]  I need to assure you, there's absolutely nothing wrong with Angela's vagina.
[03:23.080 --> 03:24.080]  Let's get back to the show.
[03:24.080 --> 03:27.480]  Yeah, well, let's get off the somber vibe and get into a show.
[03:27.480 --> 03:28.760]  I do owe another shout out.
[03:28.760 --> 03:29.760]  Two more shout outs.
[03:29.760 --> 03:32.560]  Dude, I owe a shout out to the man Afro Man.
[03:32.680 --> 03:34.200]  I saw the pics.
[03:34.200 --> 03:36.080]  I got to hang out with this dude, Afro Man.
[03:36.080 --> 03:38.400]  He sings that song, Because I Got High.
[03:38.400 --> 03:40.840]  He played a show in a town near me.
[03:40.840 --> 03:43.720]  There's a little VIP party at a dispensary called The Spot.
[03:43.720 --> 03:44.720]  Shout out to The Spot.
[03:44.720 --> 03:45.720]  What's up, Robert?
[03:45.720 --> 03:46.720]  What's up, Vegas?
[03:46.720 --> 03:48.520]  Hope you guys are listening to the show.
[03:48.520 --> 03:50.080]  Shout out to everyone at The Spot.
[03:50.080 --> 03:52.000]  They got me to see Afro Man.
[03:52.000 --> 03:53.440]  Got a couple of photos with Afro Man.
[03:53.440 --> 03:54.880]  It was actually Angela's fault.
[03:54.880 --> 03:55.880]  She works there.
[03:55.880 --> 03:57.120]  She got me the little VIP hookup.
[03:57.120 --> 03:58.560]  So thanks again, Angela.
[03:58.560 --> 04:00.160]  Super shout out.
[04:00.200 --> 04:04.520]  I walked in and Afro Man was taking pictures with people and doing a little quick private
[04:04.520 --> 04:05.520]  meet and greet.
[04:05.520 --> 04:08.200]  And he saw me and he goes, oh shit, come here, my man.
[04:08.200 --> 04:10.080]  And he took pictures with me.
[04:10.080 --> 04:11.720]  He posted my photos up on his Instagram.
[04:11.720 --> 04:13.240]  I thought it was kind of funny.
[04:13.240 --> 04:14.240]  Awesome.
[04:14.240 --> 04:16.760]  Yeah, he blew off a lot of people to come hang out with Rasta Jeff for some reason.
[04:16.760 --> 04:17.760]  Fuck yeah.
[04:17.760 --> 04:21.400]  The owners of The Spot said that he could come smoke with me, but he probably would
[04:21.400 --> 04:22.800]  not make it to his show.
[04:22.800 --> 04:24.640]  So he opted to not smoke with me.
[04:24.640 --> 04:27.680]  He was like, you look like you might murder me with some smoke.
[04:27.680 --> 04:29.120]  So yeah, he didn't want to do that.
[04:29.120 --> 04:35.440]  Yeah, well, and then you're also, yeah, at a dispensary and unfortunately not allowed
[04:35.440 --> 04:36.680]  to smoke in a dispenser.
[04:36.680 --> 04:39.200]  They totally knew I was going to drive him off in my car.
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.200]  We'd tell.
[04:40.200 --> 04:41.200]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:41.200 --> 04:42.200]  We were going to do that.
[04:42.200 --> 04:45.160]  Had you just been able to hand him a joint, it would have been a lot easier.
[04:45.160 --> 04:48.120]  You know, he did do a show in Colorado Springs after that.
[04:48.120 --> 04:49.880]  So we can't talk about what happened.
[04:49.880 --> 04:50.880]  All right.
[04:50.880 --> 04:54.360]  I want to talk about a couple of the things to shout outs are done.
[04:54.360 --> 04:55.840]  Shout out to everybody that's listening to the show.
[04:55.840 --> 04:56.840]  This is episode 40.
[04:56.840 --> 04:58.840]  We made it 40 episodes, bro.
[04:59.560 --> 05:01.360]  I promise you guys the episodes are getting better.
[05:01.360 --> 05:04.200]  I've been doing more preparation, been doing more planning.
[05:04.200 --> 05:09.160]  I've got the next few episode topics already listed of what I'm going to do.
[05:09.160 --> 05:11.960]  Coming up in a couple of episodes, we're going to do an episode about nutrients.
[05:11.960 --> 05:15.080]  I've had a couple of people ask me, tell me about nutrients.
[05:15.080 --> 05:18.880]  What is all this NPK 539 on my bottles?
[05:18.880 --> 05:20.160]  What does this shit mean?
[05:20.160 --> 05:21.160]  What should I be feeding?
[05:21.160 --> 05:22.320]  What do I need?
[05:22.320 --> 05:24.720]  So we're going to cover that.
[05:24.720 --> 05:32.040]  And also our friend, Ross Cola, King Cola, Sean is going to come be on the show.
[05:32.040 --> 05:34.600]  I haven't called him yet, but he did send me his phone number.
[05:34.600 --> 05:38.200]  I've got his phone number so I could text him and ask him to be on the show.
[05:38.200 --> 05:42.320]  He hypes a growing system that he has labeled organic as fuck.
[05:42.320 --> 05:43.320]  And I'm kind of impressed.
[05:43.320 --> 05:47.360]  I've been growing for quite a while and he has the approach that I hope to get to.
[05:47.360 --> 05:49.080]  I'm not where he is yet.
[05:49.080 --> 05:54.320]  He's got a very environmentally friendly, environmentally sustainable way of growing.
[05:54.320 --> 05:55.320]  And it's kind of impressive.
[05:55.320 --> 05:57.680]  I'm impressed and it takes a little bit to impress me.
[05:57.680 --> 06:03.600]  Yeah, he does these fermentations that look delicious.
[06:03.600 --> 06:07.240]  You know, I would almost, if I didn't know what was in there, some of that stuff would
[06:07.240 --> 06:08.240]  look tasty.
[06:08.240 --> 06:09.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:09.240 --> 06:10.240]  No, they really do.
[06:10.240 --> 06:11.240]  And it smells good because of the molasses.
[06:11.240 --> 06:12.240]  Yeah.
[06:12.240 --> 06:13.240]  All right.
[06:13.240 --> 06:14.240]  We'll let Sean tell you about his stuff when we get him on the show.
[06:14.240 --> 06:17.240]  So shout out to Ross Cola, King Cola, and organic as fuck.
[06:17.240 --> 06:19.560]  We'll get them on here pretty soon.
[06:19.560 --> 06:21.760]  And guys, I'm saying that for, but it doesn't cost money anymore.
[06:21.760 --> 06:23.600]  And I'm actually quoting this guy's brand.
[06:23.600 --> 06:25.400]  So you can't charge me on that one.
[06:25.400 --> 06:26.720]  Something you can charge me for.
[06:26.720 --> 06:29.720]  This podcast is brought to you by highly educated titanium.

[06:37.280 --> 06:40.520]  Don't trust those Chinese nails you keep seeing in head shops that are cheap.
[06:40.520 --> 06:42.640]  They're cheap for a damn reason.
[06:42.640 --> 06:43.900]  It's not titanium.
[06:43.900 --> 06:49.040]  You want grade two titanium because it's the most, I can read you off the website.

[07:18.400 --> 07:23.340]  I want to give a big shout out to Jesse for coming and doing all these episodes.
[07:24.120 --> 07:26.620]  This podcast is brought to you by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[07:26.620 --> 07:29.700]  Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations to serve Colorado.

[07:35.340 --> 07:36.340]  in Pueblo, Colorado.
[07:36.340 --> 07:38.940]  Do you have any deals this month, bro?
[07:38.940 --> 07:43.340]  We still got the roots, 707 for 25 bucks.
[07:43.340 --> 07:44.340]  Nice.
[07:44.340 --> 07:47.660]  Mentioned the I Grow Culture podcast for commercial pricing.
[07:47.660 --> 07:50.940]  I went there today and she had no problem typing in commercial pricing for me.
[07:50.940 --> 07:52.940]  I got myself a bag of soil for my seedlings.
[07:53.540 --> 07:54.540]  It was nice and easy.
[07:54.540 --> 07:57.940]  Dude, can I tell them what they'll pay for that bag of ... What did I get there?
[07:57.940 --> 07:58.940]  Is that Light Warrior?
[07:58.940 --> 07:59.940]  Yeah.
[07:59.940 --> 08:01.940]  That bag was less than 18 bucks.
[08:01.940 --> 08:04.440]  It was $17 and some change for that bag.
[08:04.440 --> 08:07.140]  Usually that's a $25 bag of dirt.
[08:07.140 --> 08:10.940]  I saved eight bucks just by telling them, hey, I listened to the I Grow Culture podcast.
[08:10.940 --> 08:11.940]  Damn.
[08:11.940 --> 08:12.940]  Yeah.
[08:12.940 --> 08:13.940]  Go get yourself a bag of soil, dude.
[08:13.940 --> 08:14.940]  It was really cool.
[08:14.940 --> 08:15.940]  It was really easy.
[08:15.940 --> 08:17.260]  They didn't even ... You know when you get a discount some places, they act like you're
[08:17.260 --> 08:18.260]  a dick.
[08:18.260 --> 08:19.260]  She's like, don't I owe you pricing?
[08:19.260 --> 08:20.820]  I was like, yes, you do.
[08:20.820 --> 08:22.860]  You do give me a deal.
[08:22.860 --> 08:25.620]  Make sure you tell them that you're listening to the I Grow Culture podcast and also check
[08:25.620 --> 08:28.540]  out their website, highgrowdenver.com.
[08:28.540 --> 08:29.540]  Pretty sure.
[08:29.540 --> 08:32.460]  I didn't write it down because I thought I remembered and apparently I just forgot.
[08:32.460 --> 08:33.460]  Yeah, highgrowdenver.com.
[08:33.460 --> 08:36.460]  I think we also have highgrow.us.
[08:36.460 --> 08:37.460]  Okay.
[08:37.460 --> 08:41.900]  They also have High Grow Pueblo has a Facebook.
[08:41.900 --> 08:44.820]  If you're in Pueblo and you want to team up on their Facebook, check it out because they
[08:44.820 --> 08:47.100]  post a lot of cool stuff on there.
[08:47.100 --> 08:48.580]  We have an Instagram too.
[08:48.580 --> 08:52.580]  Getting around to using it a little more.
[08:52.580 --> 08:54.900]  It's hard to keep up with all the social media, isn't it?
[08:54.900 --> 08:55.900]  Yeah.
[08:55.900 --> 08:59.580]  Especially, I don't know how to Instagram be in a shop.
[08:59.580 --> 09:00.580]  It feels weird.
[09:00.580 --> 09:01.580]  Right?
[09:01.580 --> 09:05.020]  Take pictures of products at the front of the store and then this is what's on sale.
[09:05.020 --> 09:06.020]  Yeah.
[09:06.020 --> 09:07.340]  We're going to start doing some cool stuff.
[09:07.340 --> 09:09.820]  We ordered a grow tent for the store.
[09:09.820 --> 09:10.820]  Sweet.
[09:10.820 --> 09:11.820]  So you can set that up.
[09:11.820 --> 09:12.820]  Yeah.
[09:12.820 --> 09:13.820]  We're going to-
[09:13.820 --> 09:14.820]  Show how to work it.
[09:14.820 --> 09:15.820]  Get some stuff going.
[09:15.820 --> 09:16.820]  Yeah.
[09:16.820 --> 09:21.700]  Then we've got the next growers meeting next Friday, I believe.
[09:21.820 --> 09:22.820]  Friday the 21st.
[09:22.820 --> 09:23.820]  Yeah.
[09:23.820 --> 09:24.820]  Yes.
[09:24.820 --> 09:25.820]  The 21st.
[09:25.820 --> 09:26.820]  It's the day after my mama's birthday.
[09:26.820 --> 09:27.820]  So happy birthday, mama.
[09:27.820 --> 09:28.820]  You don't listen to the podcast, but whatever, dude.
[09:28.820 --> 09:30.020]  It's the thought that counts.
[09:30.020 --> 09:34.260]  We got a bunch of freebies coming.
[09:34.260 --> 09:35.940]  I already have some.
[09:35.940 --> 09:37.580]  Dude, I got hooked up last time.
[09:37.580 --> 09:39.340]  I got a couple of little gifts last time.
[09:39.340 --> 09:40.340]  That was nice.
[09:40.340 --> 09:41.340]  Yeah.
[09:41.340 --> 09:42.340]  Thank you.
[09:42.340 --> 09:45.980]  So we're going to go over cloning and seeding in person.
[09:45.980 --> 09:47.460]  That'll be really helpful.
[09:47.460 --> 09:48.460]  Yeah.
[09:48.460 --> 09:49.460]  Beans and houseplants.
[09:49.460 --> 09:50.460]  Don't get your hopes up too much.
[09:50.460 --> 09:54.940]  I was going to say, are you able to clone a cannabis plant in there?
[09:54.940 --> 09:55.940]  I think we could.
[09:55.940 --> 09:59.180]  But we could just take a plant that looks just like cannabis and teach them how to do
[09:59.180 --> 10:00.180]  it and it'll work.
[10:00.180 --> 10:01.180]  Yeah.
[10:01.180 --> 10:02.180]  Okay.
[10:02.180 --> 10:03.180]  Be safe.
[10:03.180 --> 10:04.180]  Yeah.
[10:04.180 --> 10:05.180]  We like that hydro shop, so let's not risk it.
[10:05.180 --> 10:06.180]  That's where I go to get my gear for cheap.
[10:06.180 --> 10:07.180]  Yeah.
[10:07.180 --> 10:10.180]  Also, guys, this podcast is brought to you by our friends at TreeThugger.com.
[10:10.180 --> 10:11.180]  Everyone asks me, what is that?
[10:11.180 --> 10:12.180]  It's a cool name.
[10:12.180 --> 10:13.180]  Go look at it, right?
[10:13.180 --> 10:14.180]  Yeah.
[10:14.180 --> 10:17.500]  It's mostly concert and festival news and reviews is what it is.
[10:17.500 --> 10:19.940]  They talk about all the concerts that come to Red Rocks.
[10:19.940 --> 10:25.060]  If you listen to stuff like the String Cheese, Fish, Galactic, Grateful Dead, Sound Tribe
[10:25.060 --> 10:30.700]  Sector 9, the Disco Biscuits, even if you're into like Boombox and Bassnecker is who I'm
[10:30.700 --> 10:31.700]  trying to think of.
[10:31.700 --> 10:32.700]  That's not my thing.
[10:32.700 --> 10:33.700]  Sorry.
[10:33.700 --> 10:35.180]  I'm more of a Fish, Grateful Dead, Reggae kind of a kid.
[10:35.180 --> 10:37.940]  But I check it out because I want to know when Fish is coming and what the cheese is
[10:37.940 --> 10:38.940]  up to.
[10:38.940 --> 10:39.940]  For sure.
[10:39.940 --> 10:42.540]  So TreeThugger.com will keep you up to date with all of your hippie news.
[10:42.540 --> 10:47.580]  I like to say, look out at the cookout with TreeThugger.com.
[10:47.580 --> 10:50.700]  Every time you say String Cheese incident, I think of Richard Cheese.
[10:50.700 --> 10:53.900]  I love that dude.
[10:53.900 --> 10:54.900]  That's a great band.
[10:54.900 --> 10:55.900]  Richard Cheese.
[10:55.900 --> 10:59.180]  If you guys haven't listened to Richard Cheese, he does popular songs in a lounge style.
[10:59.180 --> 11:00.180]  It's pretty chill.
[11:00.180 --> 11:02.940]  Just some Rage Against the Machine, all big band style.
[11:02.940 --> 11:04.020]  Lounge against the machine.
[11:04.020 --> 11:05.020]  Lounge against the machine.
[11:05.020 --> 11:06.020]  All right.
[11:06.020 --> 11:10.860]  Usually, I would take this time to read comments on Facebook or on Stitcher and iTunes, but
[11:10.860 --> 11:12.860]  I haven't got any new comments.
[11:12.860 --> 11:13.860]  Big thanks to the people.
[11:13.860 --> 11:14.860]  Oh God, sorry.
[11:14.860 --> 11:15.860]  I got loud.
[11:15.860 --> 11:17.340]  Big thanks to the people that did leave comments.
[11:18.100 --> 11:20.140]  If you want to leave some comments on iTunes and Stitcher, I will read them.
[11:20.140 --> 11:22.500]  I also check out the comments on Facebook.
[11:22.500 --> 11:25.460]  There is an Instagram page, but like Jesse said, I don't Instagram a lot because it's
[11:25.460 --> 11:26.460]  a podcast.
[11:26.460 --> 11:29.500]  I can take pictures of Jesse and me and I can post them up.
[11:29.500 --> 11:32.020]  Other than that, not a lot to post.
[11:32.020 --> 11:33.020]  All right.
[11:33.020 --> 11:37.580]  So we're going to talk more about, I want to make sure I covered all the intro stuff.
[11:37.580 --> 11:39.500]  It's a good place to leave questions though.
[11:39.500 --> 11:41.100]  I'll say that much.
[11:41.100 --> 11:44.740]  I look at it every now and then, make sure there's no ...
[11:44.740 --> 11:45.740]  On the Instagram?
[11:45.740 --> 11:46.740]  Yeah.
[11:47.140 --> 11:49.140]  It's so hard to answer all of the questions I get.
[11:49.140 --> 11:53.060]  Since they shut down, Facebook shut down the iRegenetics Facebook page and took it from
[11:53.060 --> 11:57.300]  an interactive page and made it to just a business page, which I find boring.
[11:57.300 --> 12:01.060]  So I've gotten a lot of spare time to check Instagram and stuff like that lately.
[12:01.060 --> 12:02.940]  I don't really mess around that much on those Facebooks.
[12:02.940 --> 12:06.220]  They do check them to answer your questions, but I don't really play there like I used
[12:06.220 --> 12:07.220]  to.
[12:07.220 --> 12:11.100]  It kind of pissed me off taking my page down like that without even talking to me.
[12:11.100 --> 12:12.100]  Dicks.
[12:12.100 --> 12:13.940]  All right.
[12:13.940 --> 12:17.660]  So we've been doing grow lessons, teaching you guys, or trying to sort of stoner style
[12:17.660 --> 12:21.580]  teach you guys how to set up a grow room for yourself so that you can be self-sufficient.
[12:21.580 --> 12:22.820]  We've gotten the room built.
[12:22.820 --> 12:25.460]  We talked about the best places to do it.
[12:25.460 --> 12:27.320]  We give you a good guide.
[12:27.320 --> 12:31.060]  So far we've got a room built with lights hanging, but we haven't hung our ballasts
[12:31.060 --> 12:32.800]  yet and our timers.
[12:32.800 --> 12:35.140]  So that's kind of where we are.
[12:35.140 --> 12:37.820]  If you guys need to catch up, I'll take a pause and you can go listen to the two episodes
[12:37.820 --> 12:39.820]  before this and you can catch up to where we are.
[12:39.820 --> 12:40.820]  Pausing.
[12:40.820 --> 12:41.820]  All right.
[12:41.820 --> 12:42.820]  We're back now.
[12:42.820 --> 12:43.820]  I hope you listened to those and learned a whole shit ton.
[12:43.820 --> 12:44.820]  I didn't really pause that long.
[12:44.820 --> 12:49.100]  I should have paused longer because I need a drink.
[12:49.100 --> 12:52.100]  There's another chance.
[12:52.100 --> 12:55.940]  Oh, editing is fun.
[12:55.940 --> 12:57.340]  I don't even edit these shows anymore.
[12:57.340 --> 12:58.340]  I just put them out the way they go.
[12:58.340 --> 12:59.540]  I like, I like the flow.
[12:59.540 --> 13:01.340]  It's way better when we're just high doing our thing.
[13:01.340 --> 13:02.340]  All right.
[13:02.340 --> 13:04.300]  So we've got these big, uh, this big 10 by eight by eight.
[13:04.300 --> 13:05.300]  Yeah.
[13:05.300 --> 13:06.300]  We built an eight by eight room.
[13:06.300 --> 13:07.900]  You've got your poly wrapped around everything.
[13:07.900 --> 13:08.900]  It's all sealed up.
[13:08.900 --> 13:10.460]  You got your lights hanging.
[13:10.460 --> 13:16.340]  Um, now what I would like to do is show you the, not show you, tell you the way I hang
[13:16.340 --> 13:19.740]  my ballasts and my electronics and Jesse and I have a lot of different ideas.
[13:19.740 --> 13:21.100]  So those will get fun.
[13:21.100 --> 13:25.780]  Uh, I use a piece of plywood to Mount all of the electronics in one area at Lowe's or
[13:25.780 --> 13:26.780]  whatever hardware store.
[13:26.780 --> 13:28.660]  They actually sell a pre cut board.
[13:28.660 --> 13:31.860]  I think it's 24, it may be 18 inches by 36 inches.
[13:31.860 --> 13:36.220]  Uh, and you can screw that right onto the wall and you can hang, I can fit four, I can
[13:36.220 --> 13:39.180]  fit five ballasts and my power box on that.
[13:39.740 --> 13:43.060]  And so all of the ballasts are plugged in to the power box and it's also screwed to
[13:43.060 --> 13:44.060]  the board.
[13:44.060 --> 13:46.740]  I screwed the board to the framing on the outside of the grow room to keep the heat
[13:46.740 --> 13:47.740]  down.
[13:47.740 --> 13:51.300]  Uh, Jesse was talking about if you put it on the inside, keep it close to the door.
[13:51.300 --> 13:54.000]  The outside is ideal because if something goes wrong, you don't have to go in there
[13:54.000 --> 13:55.500]  to turn everything off.
[13:55.500 --> 13:59.420]  Um, also keep a fire extinguisher near that box.
[13:59.420 --> 14:01.220]  That's something that I recommend.
[14:01.220 --> 14:03.740]  Um, you don't want to have to run into the grow room.
[14:03.740 --> 14:06.740]  If you keep a smoke alarm in there, if there is a fire, you don't want to have to go halfway
[14:06.740 --> 14:08.860]  through the room to get to your fire extinguisher.
[14:08.860 --> 14:13.300]  You want to have it outside, kick the door open and start spraying and put out fire.
[14:13.300 --> 14:16.220]  That's your, that's your biggest fear, but we, you got to be prepared for that.
[14:16.220 --> 14:20.500]  So you got this board, you got four ballasts, you've got, I put a power box on there cause
[14:20.500 --> 14:21.500]  that's how I plug everything in.
[14:21.500 --> 14:22.500]  Uh, it's screwed to the wall.
[14:22.500 --> 14:24.500]  That's the safest way to do it too.
[14:24.500 --> 14:25.860]  Yeah, I like those power boxes.
[14:25.860 --> 14:26.860]  They're really reliable.
[14:26.860 --> 14:28.060]  Uh, they don't pay me to say that.
[14:28.060 --> 14:29.060]  I buy them straight up.
[14:29.060 --> 14:30.060]  Made in America.
[14:30.060 --> 14:31.060]  Made in America.
[14:31.060 --> 14:32.060]  Yes.
[14:32.060 --> 14:33.300]  I was going to ask you, here's a random side note.
[14:33.300 --> 14:35.100]  What ballasts are made in America?
[14:35.100 --> 14:36.100]  Do you know?
[14:36.100 --> 14:37.100]  Hmm.
[14:37.100 --> 14:38.100]  I can find out.
[14:38.940 --> 14:40.940]  You can Google that while I read on for a second.
[14:40.940 --> 14:42.260]  I'm looking just, yeah.
[14:42.260 --> 14:46.220]  Cause uh, it's almost time for me to buy several more ballasts and I would like to buy American
[14:46.220 --> 14:52.100]  made products because I noticed that the, um, what the hell brand is that?
[14:52.100 --> 14:54.660]  The quantums that used to be made in Germany.
[14:54.660 --> 14:58.380]  Now they come with a made in China or a made in Korea sticker on them and they smell funny
[14:58.380 --> 14:59.380]  now.
[14:59.380 --> 15:01.860]  And also I've noticed that the fans don't last as long.
[15:01.860 --> 15:03.540]  They start shitting out really quickly now.
[15:03.540 --> 15:05.140]  So I don't want to buy those anymore.
[15:05.140 --> 15:09.500]  Those used to be my go-to's because they don't fail like a next gen does.
[15:09.500 --> 15:11.140]  A next gen will just shit out on you.
[15:11.140 --> 15:13.140]  It'll try to start up and fail just starting.
[15:13.140 --> 15:14.140]  Yeah.
[15:14.140 --> 15:15.140]  You can't start properly.
[15:15.140 --> 15:16.140]  I don't want you.
[15:16.140 --> 15:18.980]  Actually I have a 400 watt next gen right now I'm using.
[15:18.980 --> 15:19.980]  I have a 400.
[15:19.980 --> 15:22.620]  I need to replace my 400 watt next gen cause it took a shit on me.
[15:22.620 --> 15:26.780]  I'm running a 600 in that room now just because I don't want to go buy that 400.
[15:26.780 --> 15:31.500]  Um, we actually, we've tried, they're kind of hard to find nowadays.
[15:31.500 --> 15:32.500]  The 400?
[15:32.500 --> 15:33.500]  Yeah.
[15:33.500 --> 15:34.500]  Everyone's going bigger.
[15:34.860 --> 15:38.940]  I like to keep my males under a 400 and flower just cause you can just keep them flowering
[15:38.940 --> 15:41.980]  and you don't need to run all that much light.
[15:41.980 --> 15:44.980]  If you're just doing a pheno hunt for boys, how many people pheno hunt for males?
[15:44.980 --> 15:48.620]  If you're pheno hunting for males, you're probably not listening to this show.
[15:48.620 --> 15:50.220]  You're beyond everything we've said so far.
[15:50.220 --> 15:52.060]  You should be hanging out at the table right here.
[15:52.060 --> 15:53.860]  If you're pheno hunting for males, you're invited.
[15:53.860 --> 15:54.860]  Send me a message.
[15:54.860 --> 15:55.860]  We'll find you.
[15:55.860 --> 15:56.860]  I grow culture at hotmail.com.
[15:56.860 --> 16:00.260]  We're just strategizing about that very subject.
[16:00.260 --> 16:01.260]  Yeah.
[16:01.260 --> 16:03.380]  Uh, dude, can we talk about that?
[16:03.380 --> 16:04.380]  Yeah, go for it.
[16:05.260 --> 16:06.260]  I'm getting really excited about it.
[16:06.260 --> 16:07.260]  Me too.
[16:07.260 --> 16:08.260]  I'm, I'm I read genetics.
[16:08.260 --> 16:09.260]  Of course.
[16:09.260 --> 16:10.260]  I'm Ross DeGeff from I read genetics.
[16:10.260 --> 16:11.260]  I've been running, I read genetics for a couple of few years now.
[16:11.260 --> 16:13.220]  It's been public seeds have been available.
[16:13.220 --> 16:15.740]  Uh, I cannot keep up with the demand for my product.
[16:15.740 --> 16:19.580]  I've got, I've got enough breeding space to breed plenty of seeds, but when they go on
[16:19.580 --> 16:22.700]  sale at nature's green remedies, they sell out in like 48 hours.
[16:22.700 --> 16:23.700]  Yeah.
[16:23.700 --> 16:24.700]  I've noticed.
[16:24.700 --> 16:28.380]  Uh, so our good buddy Jesse has stepped up to the plate and now I think Jesse will, I'm
[16:28.380 --> 16:31.300]  going to run a bunch of his shit as soon as it's done.
[16:31.300 --> 16:34.100]  And when I see that his stuff does good, we're going to add him to our lineup.
[16:34.820 --> 16:35.820]  He'll be part of team.
[16:35.820 --> 16:36.820]  I read genetics.
[16:36.820 --> 16:37.820]  He'll be another breeder.
[16:37.820 --> 16:38.820]  He'll be our second breeder.
[16:38.820 --> 16:39.820]  Yeah.
[16:39.820 --> 16:40.820]  Yeah.
[16:40.820 --> 16:41.820]  Tripod farms, tripod farms.
[16:41.820 --> 16:42.820]  Yeah.
[16:42.820 --> 16:46.380]  I'm excited to get them in there, but pretty soon stuff that Jesse bread will be available
[16:46.380 --> 16:48.180]  through the I read genetics catalog.
[16:48.180 --> 16:49.180]  It'll be sweet.
[16:49.180 --> 16:56.660]  That's some Kim dog stuff coming in some, uh, OG, uh, flavorful stuff coming.
[16:56.660 --> 16:58.580]  I like the teas.
[16:58.580 --> 16:59.580]  I like the teas.
[16:59.580 --> 17:02.500]  Um, I just hit on Halloween.
[17:02.500 --> 17:07.540]  I put grateful dog pollen on a platinum OG female and on a sour diesel female.
[17:07.540 --> 17:10.580]  And I've never pollinated those with the grateful dog before.
[17:10.580 --> 17:12.780]  So we'll have platinum dog and sour dog.
[17:12.780 --> 17:13.780]  Nice.
[17:13.780 --> 17:15.580]  I got that same sour you have.
[17:15.580 --> 17:16.580]  Nice.
[17:16.580 --> 17:19.180]  That's a great, I was thinking about throwing that out there, you know, dusting him up a
[17:19.180 --> 17:20.180]  little bit.
[17:20.180 --> 17:22.100]  Cause uh, that's a great strain.
[17:22.100 --> 17:23.140]  It's stanky.
[17:23.140 --> 17:25.740]  It just doesn't grow with the vigor that I want.
[17:25.740 --> 17:28.060]  I want a heartier, thicker plant.
[17:28.060 --> 17:29.060]  Top it.
[17:29.540 --> 17:30.540]  That's what you got to do.
[17:30.540 --> 17:34.740]  It's got good yield for a plant that normally exhibits that trait though.
[17:34.740 --> 17:35.740]  Yeah.
[17:35.740 --> 17:36.740]  Yeah.
[17:36.740 --> 17:37.740]  And flower her early because man, that thing takes off.
[17:37.740 --> 17:39.060]  Dude, I learned the hard way.
[17:39.060 --> 17:40.700]  It doesn't keep up with gorilla glue.
[17:40.700 --> 17:43.100]  My gorilla glue has tripled in size since I started flowering.
[17:43.100 --> 17:44.100]  Yeah.
[17:44.100 --> 17:45.100]  Nice.
[17:45.100 --> 17:46.100]  Do you find me an American made ballast?
[17:46.100 --> 17:53.020]  Um, no, I'm not finding a, I don't suspect, uh, the galaxies are, um, I know sunlight
[17:53.020 --> 17:57.140]  a lot of their, uh, uh, products are made in America.
[17:57.220 --> 17:59.940]  Um, yeah, I don't know.
[17:59.940 --> 18:00.940]  We'll keep going.
[18:00.940 --> 18:03.660]  We'll find, if you guys have an idea of a good American made ballast, let me know.
[18:03.660 --> 18:04.660]  Cause it's for me.
[18:04.660 --> 18:05.660]  I'm shopping.
[18:05.660 --> 18:06.660]  I need a lot of them.
[18:06.660 --> 18:07.660]  Oh man.
[18:07.660 --> 18:08.660]  You know what?
[18:08.660 --> 18:09.660]  Actually, I think I know of one.
[18:09.660 --> 18:11.860]  It's a really expensive one.
[18:11.860 --> 18:13.620]  The Gavitas or the?
[18:13.620 --> 18:15.420]  No, those would be made in Holland.
[18:15.420 --> 18:16.420]  Yeah.
[18:16.420 --> 18:17.420]  That's what I thought.
[18:17.420 --> 18:18.420]  What's the Gavitas competitor?
[18:18.420 --> 18:19.420]  The E-Paps?
[18:19.420 --> 18:20.420]  E-Paps.
[18:20.420 --> 18:21.420]  I believe those are China.
[18:21.420 --> 18:22.420]  China.
[18:22.420 --> 18:23.420]  And so are the Nano Lux DEs.
[18:23.420 --> 18:24.420]  I know those are made in China.
[18:24.420 --> 18:25.420]  Are lush lights made in America?
[18:25.420 --> 18:26.420]  I'm getting rid of just some of those out.
[18:26.900 --> 18:31.140]  I wonder if lush lights are made in America or if they're made in China.
[18:31.140 --> 18:33.740]  I would suspect they're made in America.
[18:33.740 --> 18:35.420]  I'd really hope they are.
[18:35.420 --> 18:38.740]  Oh, uh, Solus Tech, made in California.
[18:38.740 --> 18:39.740]  Okay.
[18:39.740 --> 18:40.740]  Yeah.
[18:40.740 --> 18:41.740]  Really good stuff.
[18:41.740 --> 18:42.740]  Something to check out guys.
[18:42.740 --> 18:43.740]  Solus Tech.
[18:43.740 --> 18:44.740]  Recommended by the Cottonmouth Kings even.
[18:44.740 --> 18:48.740]  I thought that was one of the weirdest endorsements I ever saw in my life.
[18:48.740 --> 18:49.740]  We recommend these ballasts.
[18:49.740 --> 18:53.300]  Shouldn't a breeder or somebody endorse that shit?
[18:53.340 --> 18:57.940]  I suspect that maybe the, uh, uh, Horderlux makes ballasts.
[18:57.940 --> 19:00.540]  I think maybe their stuff's made in America.
[19:00.540 --> 19:01.540]  Okay.
[19:01.540 --> 19:03.180]  Um, I want to buy American made ballasts guys.
[19:03.180 --> 19:04.420]  I encourage you to also.
[19:04.420 --> 19:09.860]  So I take this board that I bought at Lowe's and I put the board on the floor and I mount
[19:09.860 --> 19:10.860]  my ballast.
[19:10.860 --> 19:11.860]  I don't screw it to the floor.
[19:11.860 --> 19:12.860]  I set it on the floor so I can work.
[19:12.860 --> 19:13.860]  Let me be clear about that.
[19:13.860 --> 19:17.740]  I set the board on the floor and then I screw the ballasts to the, to the board and then
[19:17.740 --> 19:21.060]  I screw my power box to the board and now this board is movable.
[19:21.060 --> 19:23.940]  You can hang your ballast damn near anywhere you want.
[19:23.940 --> 19:25.940]  Bolt that to where it is convenient for you.
[19:25.940 --> 19:28.660]  If it's outside of the room is what I would prefer because then you're keeping heat out.
[19:28.660 --> 19:29.660]  Those ballasts get hot.
[19:29.660 --> 19:30.660]  Yeah.
[19:30.660 --> 19:34.380]  Do it outside of the room and then, then you can mess with your timers and stuff and not
[19:34.380 --> 19:36.780]  be in the room so that it's just easier.
[19:36.780 --> 19:39.540]  So bolt that wherever you need, screw that wherever you need to the framing, then run
[19:39.540 --> 19:43.500]  that wiring through a small hole in the poly and tape over it to keep the light from leaking.
[19:43.500 --> 19:46.820]  So now you've got air in, air out, lights and power.
[19:46.820 --> 19:49.060]  You're probably going to need to cool down the room.
[19:49.980 --> 19:52.540]  An air conditioner is definitely what you're going to need.
[19:52.540 --> 19:54.780]  You may need a dehumidifier.
[19:54.780 --> 20:00.460]  So take another small board and put your air conditioner thermostat on there.
[20:00.460 --> 20:04.980]  If you have one that doesn't attach to the air conditioner, you can plug your air conditioner
[20:04.980 --> 20:09.300]  into a temperature sensor and hang that on the wall.
[20:09.300 --> 20:13.180]  And then when the temperature gets to a certain thing, to the certain temperature during the,
[20:13.180 --> 20:14.740]  you can set the day and night temperature.
[20:14.740 --> 20:18.700]  And then that little meter will tell the air conditioner when to come on and when to go
[20:18.700 --> 20:19.700]  off.
[20:19.700 --> 20:22.100]  And you can do that with almost any piece of equipment in your room.
[20:22.100 --> 20:28.380]  You can automate your dehumidifier, your air conditioner, you can automate your fans.
[20:28.380 --> 20:30.860]  In one room, I've got an emergency shutdown switch.
[20:30.860 --> 20:34.340]  If it hits over 95 degrees in that room, everything turns off.
[20:34.340 --> 20:35.340]  Everything.
[20:35.340 --> 20:37.500]  Even the air conditioners, because I don't know what's causing the problem.
[20:37.500 --> 20:40.740]  So everything just shuts off and the ambient temps are only going to be 70 something in
[20:40.740 --> 20:45.100]  that area anyway when there's no light.
[20:45.100 --> 20:49.260]  You can put all your automation stuff on one board and put that where it's visible.
[20:49.260 --> 20:51.700]  Put a thermometer, a hygrometer on there.
[20:51.700 --> 20:55.460]  All this stuff that you want to be able to see, sometimes that has to be inside the room.
[20:55.460 --> 20:56.780]  So put that in the room if you have to.
[20:56.780 --> 21:00.060]  If you can get the, if you want that outside of the room, it'll be more expensive.
[21:00.060 --> 21:01.060]  Trust me.
[21:01.060 --> 21:03.380]  But that one will probably have to go in the room.
[21:03.380 --> 21:06.780]  So just put all your stuff onto one board and nail it to one spot up high where you
[21:06.780 --> 21:07.780]  can see it.
[21:07.780 --> 21:11.780]  A random side note, when you're building a grow room and you're thinking about planning
[21:11.780 --> 21:16.220]  a grow room, think of water goes low, electrical goes high.
[21:16.220 --> 21:17.820]  You want your water low on the ground.
[21:17.820 --> 21:21.220]  If you have a bucket, if you've got a reservoir, there's no need to lift that up off the ground
[21:21.220 --> 21:22.220]  too high.
[21:22.220 --> 21:26.300]  Keep it low because if it does topple over, you don't want it to spill on your electronics,
[21:26.300 --> 21:28.620]  which should be kept above waist high.
[21:28.620 --> 21:32.540]  I don't run conduit along the wall lower than about 36 inches.
[21:32.540 --> 21:33.540]  That's my waist.
[21:33.540 --> 21:34.540]  I actually believe that's code.
[21:34.540 --> 21:35.540]  Yeah, pretty sure.
[21:35.540 --> 21:36.540]  Okay.
[21:36.540 --> 21:37.540]  Yeah.
[21:37.540 --> 21:38.540]  Well, that makes sense.
[21:38.540 --> 21:39.540]  But these guys aren't, they're just building a room.
[21:39.540 --> 21:40.540]  So I'm not going to go in there.
[21:40.540 --> 21:41.540]  They're just building a room.
[21:41.540 --> 21:46.660]  So we got to keep water low, electricity high because you don't want to pour water in your
[21:46.660 --> 21:47.660]  electricity ever.
[21:47.660 --> 21:49.140]  Keep your cords organized.
[21:49.140 --> 21:52.580]  You guys, I've seen so many messes of grow rooms.
[21:52.580 --> 21:53.580]  Keep them as short as possible.
[21:53.580 --> 21:54.580]  Yeah.
[21:54.580 --> 21:55.580]  Yeah.
[21:55.580 --> 21:56.580]  I'm going to turn this mic up.
[21:56.580 --> 21:57.580]  Sorry.
[21:57.580 --> 21:58.580]  No worries.
[21:58.580 --> 21:59.580]  It kind of tipped.
[21:59.580 --> 22:00.780]  It got impotent on us.
[22:00.780 --> 22:03.740]  And put a smoke alarm and fire detector where you can get to them.
[22:03.740 --> 22:05.700]  Smoke alarm in the room, the fire detector outside of the room.
[22:05.700 --> 22:08.220]  Those are little side notes that I wrote.
[22:08.220 --> 22:11.660]  So you're going to need air conditioning is what I wrote down next.
[22:11.660 --> 22:16.740]  I follow the general rule of 3000 BTUs of air conditioning per 1000 watt light.
[22:16.740 --> 22:20.060]  If you want to use those traditional ACs you can put in the window, you can cut a hole
[22:20.060 --> 22:21.060]  that do go in a window.
[22:21.060 --> 22:25.300]  You can cut a hole in the poly and mount the AC to the framing, but that's going to heat
[22:25.300 --> 22:28.260]  up whatever room you dumped the AC exhaust into.
[22:28.260 --> 22:31.540]  If you're in a garage or an unused basement, that's cool.
[22:31.540 --> 22:33.100]  But you can't heat up like if you're...
[22:33.100 --> 22:34.900]  You have to exhaust that heat out.
[22:34.900 --> 22:37.100]  It's got to go somewhere or it's just going to continue to heat up.
[22:37.100 --> 22:38.100]  Yeah.
[22:38.100 --> 22:40.780]  I've seen a lot of people run it straight through the chimney if you got one.
[22:40.780 --> 22:43.180]  I've seen it go into the attic if you need to.
[22:43.180 --> 22:45.460]  If you guys are in illegal states, you're going to have to plan this a little better
[22:45.460 --> 22:49.660]  because your heat signature is what they're going to look for to bust you, I think.
[22:49.660 --> 22:54.580]  I've heard they have to have a warrant for that, but I'm no lawyer.
[22:54.580 --> 22:55.580]  Right.
[22:55.580 --> 23:00.220]  Well, and it's also 2014, almost 15, where the cops can do just about whatever they want.
[23:00.220 --> 23:01.220]  This is true too.
[23:01.220 --> 23:03.140]  We are living in a police state.
[23:03.140 --> 23:04.140]  Yeah.
[23:04.140 --> 23:05.140]  They'll just fly over with that camera.
[23:05.180 --> 23:06.860]  They'll say, oh, look, all that bright light.
[23:06.860 --> 23:09.740]  And then they'll just send a car to go sit in front of your house and then they'll notice
[23:09.740 --> 23:11.260]  some shit.
[23:11.260 --> 23:14.300]  The cops are the worst gang that we have nowadays.
[23:14.300 --> 23:16.380]  The worst criminals on the damn streets.
[23:16.380 --> 23:19.780]  On the air conditioners, if it's going to outside, a lot of them...
[23:19.780 --> 23:26.420]  If the air conditioner's in your room and it's in an outside window, light shines through.
[23:26.420 --> 23:27.420]  Yes.
[23:27.420 --> 23:31.420]  You can take a can of spray paint, get you...
[23:31.420 --> 23:38.860]  I can't remember how I did it, but there's some way you can get a nozzle on there that
[23:38.860 --> 23:41.740]  you can stick a little straw in, like WD-40.
[23:41.740 --> 23:44.140]  I was going to say the WD-40 straw.
[23:44.140 --> 23:45.140]  Yeah.
[23:45.140 --> 23:46.140]  Perfectly.
[23:46.140 --> 23:52.340]  And spray the white foam inside the vents with black spray paint and it's all clean
[23:52.340 --> 23:53.340]  and everything.
[23:53.340 --> 23:54.340]  It'll stop your reflective.
[23:54.340 --> 23:55.540]  And it stops the light from coming out.
[23:55.540 --> 23:56.540]  Good idea.
[23:56.540 --> 23:57.540]  Good idea.
[23:57.540 --> 23:58.540]  And if you're putting that in the...
[23:58.660 --> 24:01.660]  I picked that up from Subcool, actually.
[24:01.660 --> 24:02.660]  Shout out to Subcool.
[24:02.660 --> 24:03.660]  Yeah.
[24:03.660 --> 24:04.660]  Did you...
[24:04.660 --> 24:05.660]  So I didn't brag about this.
[24:05.660 --> 24:06.660]  I posted a really sweet picture to Instagram the other day and Subcool actually sent me
[24:06.660 --> 24:07.660]  a message that said we should collab.
[24:07.660 --> 24:08.660]  So in the future, there could be some TGA, iRegenetics stuff happening, but right now
[24:08.660 --> 24:09.660]  I'm going to focus on what I'm doing with Jesse because I know that's for real and I
[24:09.660 --> 24:10.660]  know I can trust Jesse.
[24:10.660 --> 24:11.660]  I don't know anybody else out there.
[24:11.660 --> 24:12.660]  What else?
[24:12.660 --> 24:13.660]  I'm really honored to be a part of this.
[24:13.660 --> 24:14.660]  I'm a big fan of the show.
[24:14.660 --> 24:15.660]  I'm a big fan of the show.
[24:15.660 --> 24:16.660]  I'm a big fan of the show.
[24:16.660 --> 24:17.660]  I'm a big fan of the show.
[24:17.660 --> 24:18.660]  I'm a big fan of the show.
[24:18.660 --> 24:19.660]  I'm a big fan of the show.
[24:19.820 --> 24:22.020]  I know that's for real and I know I can trust Jesse.
[24:22.020 --> 24:24.020]  I don't know anybody else out there.
[24:24.020 --> 24:25.560]  What else?
[24:25.560 --> 24:26.560]  That...
[24:26.560 --> 24:29.760]  I'm really honored for that too.
[24:29.760 --> 24:33.500]  Oh, dude, you're like the first person I thought of.
[24:33.500 --> 24:34.500]  For sure.
[24:34.500 --> 24:35.500]  Yeah, for sure.
[24:35.500 --> 24:38.460]  Fuck, I had something else I wanted to say before we got sidetracked.
[24:38.460 --> 24:43.020]  The black spray paint on the air conditioner...
[24:43.020 --> 24:44.140]  Keeping light out?
[24:44.140 --> 24:45.300]  Yeah, shit.
[24:45.300 --> 24:46.300]  Keep going.
[24:46.300 --> 24:47.300]  Okay.
[24:47.300 --> 24:49.140]  use the, and they take more energy,
[24:49.140 --> 24:51.400]  but I like those air conditioners on wheels.
[24:51.400 --> 24:52.940]  They have a little duct, you can just duct it
[24:52.940 --> 24:55.820]  right out of a six inch duct, it works perfect.
[24:55.820 --> 24:58.340]  Those are glorious, they take a little more
[24:58.340 --> 25:00.300]  electricity, but they're awesome.
[25:00.300 --> 25:02.420]  Also you need maybe a fan speed controller,
[25:02.420 --> 25:04.740]  if you're, those are always helpful.
[25:04.740 --> 25:08.340]  Just, there's always a reason to add a fan speed controller.
[25:08.340 --> 25:10.940]  I bought a little thermostat thing to turn off
[25:10.940 --> 25:13.880]  my air cool fans when it gets too cold outside.
[25:13.880 --> 25:17.760]  So, that's, I walked out to the room the other day
[25:17.760 --> 25:20.520]  and there's 4,000 watt lights burning,
[25:21.560 --> 25:26.400]  and normally, you know, it's 72, 68 degrees in there,
[25:26.400 --> 25:29.440]  and it was like 55 degrees.
[25:29.440 --> 25:31.560]  I shut all the fans off, everything,
[25:31.560 --> 25:34.720]  and it took most of the light cycle to heat back up.
[25:34.720 --> 25:35.960]  Yeah, so.
[25:35.960 --> 25:37.240]  I'm loving this wind.
[25:37.240 --> 25:39.320]  It was negative six degrees here the other night
[25:39.320 --> 25:40.320]  where we live.
[25:40.320 --> 25:41.400]  Very fucking cold.
[25:41.400 --> 25:43.040]  That is cold, yeah.
[25:43.040 --> 25:46.360]  My air conditioners aren't on in any of my grows right now,
[25:46.360 --> 25:47.920]  and I'm confident that that's okay.
[25:47.920 --> 25:49.720]  I've turned all of the air conditioners off.
[25:49.720 --> 25:52.680]  Just let that, I'm saving some electricity right now.
[25:52.680 --> 25:54.160]  A lot of electricity.
[25:54.160 --> 25:55.280]  Yeah.
[25:55.280 --> 25:59.760]  We heat with wood, and yeah, I've gone through
[25:59.760 --> 26:02.520]  an insane amount of firewood in the last three days.
[26:02.520 --> 26:03.360]  Wow.
[26:03.360 --> 26:08.360]  Yeah, that's probably 300, 400 pounds shit,
[26:08.640 --> 26:09.480]  I don't even know.
[26:09.480 --> 26:10.920]  You build your rooms to where they're,
[26:10.920 --> 26:12.600]  you build your grows to where there are a lot of work.
[26:13.120 --> 26:14.560]  I'm that guy that automates as much as I can,
[26:14.560 --> 26:15.760]  so that I do not.
[26:15.760 --> 26:16.800]  Oh, I'm just talking about my house.
[26:16.800 --> 26:19.200]  Oh, just the house, holy shit, okay.
[26:19.200 --> 26:22.680]  Man, I don't automate any of my waterings.
[26:22.680 --> 26:23.840]  I feel that I need to be in there
[26:23.840 --> 26:26.080]  watering the plants by hand myself.
[26:26.080 --> 26:26.960]  That's when I touch them.
[26:26.960 --> 26:29.520]  I move every pot when I water.
[26:29.520 --> 26:30.480]  I touch every plant.
[26:30.480 --> 26:33.120]  I look at, I'll pull off a leaf off of almost every plant
[26:33.120 --> 26:35.320]  and look at the bottom, look for a bug.
[26:35.320 --> 26:36.520]  I'm Angel in the room.
[26:37.480 --> 26:39.920]  I've got like a ritual that I go through in there every day.
[26:40.440 --> 26:42.880]  No, you can't bug me until this is done
[26:42.880 --> 26:45.160]  or everything will go wrong.
[26:45.160 --> 26:46.600]  I have to love this room,
[26:46.600 --> 26:48.600]  but I automate almost everything else I can.
[26:48.600 --> 26:50.520]  Of course, your light cycles, your air conditioning,
[26:50.520 --> 26:53.520]  your dehumidifier, your CO2, all that stuff.
[26:53.520 --> 26:55.320]  Then in the new rules that they're trying to propose here
[26:55.320 --> 26:59.000]  in Pueblo, Colorado, they want to ban CO2 augmentation.
[26:59.000 --> 26:59.840]  What?
[26:59.840 --> 27:00.840]  Yeah, that's one of the stupid things
[27:00.840 --> 27:01.760]  they wrote in the rules.
[27:01.760 --> 27:03.320]  So we'll talk about that more in the future,
[27:03.320 --> 27:05.000]  but that just came up in my head.
[27:05.000 --> 27:05.840]  Yeah.
[27:05.840 --> 27:06.920]  Pueblo, Pueblo, Pueblo.
[27:06.920 --> 27:08.600]  Right, right, clown shoes.
[27:08.600 --> 27:09.440]  Yeah.
[27:09.960 --> 27:10.800]  Clown shoes, guys.
[27:10.800 --> 27:12.040]  Size 55, triple E.
[27:13.360 --> 27:14.200]  Yes.
[27:15.120 --> 27:18.440]  So yeah, you got your, I hope that made sense.
[27:18.440 --> 27:20.480]  We just mounted the ballast right to a board.
[27:20.480 --> 27:21.920]  Then we put the board right up on the wall
[27:21.920 --> 27:23.000]  and then you got to run all the cables.
[27:23.000 --> 27:23.840]  That's the part I skipped.
[27:23.840 --> 27:25.240]  Make sure when you push the cables together,
[27:25.240 --> 27:26.240]  make sure you push them tight.
[27:26.240 --> 27:27.080]  All the way.
[27:27.080 --> 27:29.240]  All the way tight, because when that shit's loose,
[27:29.240 --> 27:31.000]  that's electricity that's live right there
[27:31.000 --> 27:32.240]  just being exposed.
[27:32.240 --> 27:34.800]  I want to design, I've made them myself.
[27:34.800 --> 27:36.880]  I just bend them all up, but out of wire,
[27:36.880 --> 27:39.280]  but I do a safety wire too.
[27:40.120 --> 27:40.960]  To hold it all together.
[27:40.960 --> 27:43.000]  When I was in bands, I learned to tie cords
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.640]  that are connected together in that knot,
[27:44.640 --> 27:46.400]  where if you pull, instead it tightens the knot
[27:46.400 --> 27:47.640]  instead of them coming apart.
[27:47.640 --> 27:49.000]  I like that move a lot.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.440]  I used to be a roadie and a musician.
[27:51.440 --> 27:52.880]  Back in the 70s, man.
[27:54.440 --> 27:56.600]  I talked about a tip on pictures,
[27:56.600 --> 27:59.040]  and since we're talking about running cords,
[27:59.040 --> 27:59.880]  here it is.
[28:01.080 --> 28:03.800]  The cord that runs from the ballast to the light
[28:03.800 --> 28:06.360]  is what causes all the bars in your picture.
[28:06.360 --> 28:08.440]  So the shorter those are,
[28:08.440 --> 28:12.400]  and the neater they're hung and everything,
[28:12.400 --> 28:15.960]  the less bars and shit you'll have coming up on your picture.
[28:15.960 --> 28:17.800]  You know, on some cameras.
[28:17.800 --> 28:19.400]  Because it's the magnetics that causes that.
[28:19.400 --> 28:20.240]  Yeah, okay.
[28:21.400 --> 28:22.240]  I think I can't.
[28:22.240 --> 28:23.680]  That's a good tip, I didn't know that.
[28:23.680 --> 28:25.080]  I can't remember, I haven't,
[28:26.200 --> 28:29.560]  I didn't really care about it when I set up my new room.
[28:29.560 --> 28:33.400]  I think if you keep all the cords away from each other too,
[28:34.760 --> 28:38.040]  individually instead of tied together on the ceiling.
[28:38.480 --> 28:39.560]  Yeah, well, that makes sense.
[28:39.560 --> 28:42.440]  Because you're getting way more of that signal all at once.
[28:42.440 --> 28:43.540]  That would make sense.
[28:45.080 --> 28:47.040]  I wrote down so much stuff on so many different papers,
[28:47.040 --> 28:48.280]  I'm looking for them all.
[28:49.880 --> 28:51.720]  Too many different things on too many papers.
[28:51.720 --> 28:53.080]  Yeah, that looks way professional.
[28:53.080 --> 28:54.680]  I'm trying, dude, I'm trying.
[28:54.680 --> 28:55.880]  Looks like Howard Stern.
[28:57.320 --> 28:58.160]  Hey now.
[28:59.560 --> 29:00.440]  Can I get sued for that?
[29:00.440 --> 29:02.040]  That's like his fucking trademark, huh?
[29:02.040 --> 29:02.880]  Screw that, man.
[29:02.880 --> 29:04.880]  Sorry, Howard, I didn't mean to steal your trademark.
[29:04.880 --> 29:07.260]  That was flattery is what that was.
[29:08.160 --> 29:10.720]  All right, so we've got this room mostly figured out.
[29:10.720 --> 29:11.560]  We've got lights hung,
[29:11.560 --> 29:14.120]  we've got all of our automation set up, hopefully.
[29:14.120 --> 29:15.720]  We got air going in, we got air going out.
[29:15.720 --> 29:17.160]  We've got an air conditioner.
[29:17.160 --> 29:18.680]  Now that you got most of everything set up,
[29:18.680 --> 29:20.520]  you got your pond liner on the floor.
[29:20.520 --> 29:24.900]  I would add four four by four tables.
[29:24.900 --> 29:27.320]  I use, and I don't wanna say brands,
[29:27.320 --> 29:30.040]  but I use the Hydro Farm four by four white flood tables
[29:30.040 --> 29:31.400]  because they're perfect.
[29:31.400 --> 29:32.240]  Those are perfect.
[29:32.240 --> 29:33.800]  I like to raise them up off the ground.
[29:33.800 --> 29:36.080]  I like the white botanic care trays.
[29:36.120 --> 29:38.160]  You can find someone to make you a stand for them
[29:38.160 --> 29:39.840]  or you can put them on buckets.
[29:39.840 --> 29:42.840]  Those tables that they sell are so damn expensive.
[29:42.840 --> 29:44.520]  Don't buy the tables that are prefabbed
[29:44.520 --> 29:48.040]  unless you're looking to look like you got a pro-load room.
[29:48.040 --> 29:50.640]  And just straight up Hydro store guy here,
[29:50.640 --> 29:52.400]  most of those tables are bullshit.
[29:54.480 --> 29:55.320]  The Bigfoot table.
[29:55.320 --> 29:56.140]  I could kick one over.
[29:56.140 --> 29:57.140]  Yeah, I was gonna say the Bigfoot table
[29:57.140 --> 29:59.160]  is just stuck together with little plastic pegs.
[29:59.160 --> 30:00.720]  It can fall over so easily.
[30:00.720 --> 30:01.840]  They're ridiculous.
[30:01.840 --> 30:02.800]  Yeah.
[30:02.800 --> 30:04.840]  The reason I like the tables and the trays,
[30:04.840 --> 30:06.760]  I like to get the plants up off the ground.
[30:06.760 --> 30:08.360]  The floor gets too cold.
[30:08.360 --> 30:09.200]  Yeah.
[30:09.200 --> 30:10.160]  When you lift them up off the ground,
[30:10.160 --> 30:11.840]  you get a more regulated temperature.
[30:11.840 --> 30:13.600]  I feel like you can get a little more airflow
[30:13.600 --> 30:14.960]  and I'm six foot five, dude.
[30:14.960 --> 30:16.480]  Having plants down on the ground,
[30:16.480 --> 30:18.680]  I have to get on my knee to get down to the soil
[30:18.680 --> 30:20.360]  to see what's happening at the soil level
[30:20.360 --> 30:21.760]  or the bottom foliage.
[30:21.760 --> 30:23.320]  Lifting them up off the ground two feet,
[30:23.320 --> 30:24.760]  now they're in my face.
[30:24.760 --> 30:25.600]  They're right where I want them
[30:25.600 --> 30:28.160]  and I don't have to squat all day.
[30:28.160 --> 30:30.080]  I like that better too.
[30:30.080 --> 30:32.200]  You get to see a lot more of what's going on too.
[30:32.200 --> 30:33.040]  Yeah.
[30:33.040 --> 30:34.720]  It's just I feel, you know, you know this way more.
[30:35.600 --> 30:36.440]  For sure.
[30:36.440 --> 30:37.280]  And that's kind of,
[30:37.280 --> 30:38.480]  it depends on how much space you have
[30:38.480 --> 30:39.600]  and how big a plant you want to grow.
[30:39.600 --> 30:41.760]  If you're growing seven gallon pots
[30:41.760 --> 30:42.960]  and you're putting them on a table,
[30:42.960 --> 30:44.640]  now you're going to have a seven foot tall plant.
[30:44.640 --> 30:45.480]  Maybe you might be in,
[30:45.480 --> 30:47.240]  so you got to plan ahead.
[30:47.240 --> 30:48.360]  But the four by four tables,
[30:48.360 --> 30:50.600]  you can fit four, seven gallon pots
[30:50.600 --> 30:52.320]  or nine or 12, three gallon pots.
[30:52.320 --> 30:55.240]  You can, they're perfect for one light worth of stuff.
[30:55.240 --> 30:57.040]  If you're in a legal state and you got the numbers
[30:57.040 --> 30:58.520]  and you're going to do hydro,
[30:58.520 --> 31:01.680]  you can do 64, those little six inch rock wool cubes
[31:01.680 --> 31:02.800]  and just put a clone in there
[31:02.840 --> 31:04.920]  and veg them for like a week and flower in there.
[31:04.920 --> 31:06.640]  Dude, I've seen people pull a pound and a half
[31:06.640 --> 31:08.040]  off of 64 little clones,
[31:08.040 --> 31:10.240]  veg for a week and a half on a table like that.
[31:10.240 --> 31:11.720]  64 little nugs.
[31:11.720 --> 31:12.600]  Yup. That's all it was.
[31:12.600 --> 31:15.560]  They weighed about seven grams each or something.
[31:15.560 --> 31:17.040]  The Cali connection.
[31:17.040 --> 31:18.880]  That's how, totally how Swerve does it.
[31:18.880 --> 31:20.240]  Recipe to success or whatever he calls it.
[31:20.240 --> 31:21.320]  Fast track to success.
[31:21.320 --> 31:22.160]  Yeah, fast track to success.
[31:22.160 --> 31:23.000]  Shout out to Swerve.
[31:23.000 --> 31:23.840]  What up Swerve?
[31:23.840 --> 31:24.680]  That's my homie.
[31:24.680 --> 31:26.400]  Well, I haven't heard much from that guy in a while.
[31:26.400 --> 31:28.000]  You know, he has been,
[31:28.000 --> 31:30.760]  social media, social media kind of killed everybody.
[31:30.760 --> 31:33.280]  Facebook went and the Facebook Nazi police went
[31:33.280 --> 31:34.920]  and made everybody use our real names.
[31:34.920 --> 31:37.480]  Now when I scroll through, I don't even know anybody.
[31:38.400 --> 31:39.240]  Except Goma.
[31:40.240 --> 31:41.080]  What the hell?
[31:41.080 --> 31:42.240]  How'd you pull that off, dude?
[31:42.240 --> 31:44.860]  You can, here's the trick guys.
[31:44.860 --> 31:47.880]  If you are a drag queen,
[31:47.880 --> 31:49.240]  and I know that's not the appropriate word,
[31:49.240 --> 31:50.560]  but I don't know the appropriate word anymore.
[31:50.560 --> 31:52.920]  I'm not politically correct in the drag queen scene.
[31:52.920 --> 31:55.400]  That's my cousin's one, yeah.
[31:55.400 --> 31:56.880]  All right, well if you're a drag queen,
[31:56.880 --> 31:58.240]  you can email Facebook and say,
[31:58.240 --> 32:00.520]  I'm a drag queen and this is my alter ego.
[32:01.240 --> 32:03.960]  And they will allow you to use your fake name.
[32:03.960 --> 32:04.800]  Wow.
[32:04.800 --> 32:05.620]  Yeah.
[32:05.620 --> 32:06.460]  Huh.
[32:06.460 --> 32:08.840]  That probably won't work anymore after a couple of days
[32:08.840 --> 32:10.200]  that this show is out and people try it,
[32:10.200 --> 32:11.120]  but that's worked for,
[32:11.120 --> 32:12.720]  that's why a lot of the people that,
[32:12.720 --> 32:15.040]  like in the cannabis community,
[32:15.040 --> 32:16.720]  handmade, they're still Richard,
[32:16.720 --> 32:19.080]  or they're still handmade instead of Adam Hand.
[32:20.360 --> 32:23.320]  Yeah, a lot of people got to keep their shit.
[32:23.320 --> 32:24.160]  That's random.
[32:24.160 --> 32:26.040]  Huh, yeah.
[32:26.040 --> 32:28.680]  I know a bunch of drag queens that like to know that.
[32:28.680 --> 32:30.160]  Yeah.
[32:30.160 --> 32:31.600]  They all had to put their real names up.
[32:31.600 --> 32:32.480]  Oh, that sucks.
[32:32.480 --> 32:35.120]  Yeah, well, because now instead of being Simone LaRue,
[32:35.120 --> 32:38.320]  it's Michael Witt.
[32:40.200 --> 32:41.040]  No, not Witt.
[32:41.040 --> 32:42.400]  No, I'm sorry.
[32:43.320 --> 32:44.160]  I had to try.
[32:44.160 --> 32:45.000]  I had to try.
[32:46.320 --> 32:49.440]  I know who your dad is, I should shut my mouth.
[32:49.440 --> 32:50.960]  What's up, Mr. Witt?
[32:50.960 --> 32:53.120]  Hope to see you at the Grover's meeting,
[32:53.120 --> 32:55.160]  November 21st at High Grove Indoor Growing Supplies.
[32:55.160 --> 32:56.000]  It's going to be awesome.
[32:56.000 --> 32:56.820]  I will be there.
[32:56.820 --> 32:57.660]  Rasta Jeff will be there.
[32:57.660 --> 33:00.180]  Also that night, here's a random plug.
[33:00.180 --> 33:03.060]  Joe Rogan's new comedy special comes out on Comedy Central
[33:03.060 --> 33:05.100]  the night of the 21st at midnight.
[33:05.100 --> 33:06.980]  So I'm going to leave High Grove Indoor Growing Supplies
[33:06.980 --> 33:07.820]  and I'm going to come home
[33:07.820 --> 33:08.860]  and I'm going to get super dabbed out
[33:08.860 --> 33:10.540]  and I'm going to watch the Joe Rogan special
[33:10.540 --> 33:12.300]  because I was there at Comedy Works
[33:12.300 --> 33:13.300]  when that shit was recorded.
[33:13.300 --> 33:16.300]  And I want to see if they show my high ass on that thing.
[33:16.300 --> 33:17.900]  Shit, I'm going to have to watch it.
[33:17.900 --> 33:19.660]  Dude, it was weird.
[33:19.660 --> 33:22.580]  We're totally off topic guys, but have fun with us.
[33:22.580 --> 33:25.020]  They were seating us for the Joe Rogan experience
[33:25.020 --> 33:27.340]  or the recording of his live show.
[33:28.020 --> 33:29.620]  And there were cameras all over Comedy Works
[33:29.620 --> 33:31.220]  and they put me and my crew,
[33:31.220 --> 33:33.700]  there was me and my date and one of our good friends
[33:33.700 --> 33:35.380]  and we all had dreadlocks
[33:35.380 --> 33:38.300]  and they put us in about row eight where no one can see us.
[33:38.300 --> 33:39.780]  And so we're like, yeah, I get it.
[33:39.780 --> 33:41.600]  But then they would bring in normal looking people
[33:41.600 --> 33:43.620]  and set them in rows three and four.
[33:43.620 --> 33:46.100]  But then if a guy came in with a good looking girl,
[33:46.100 --> 33:47.540]  like there was a girl that came in
[33:47.540 --> 33:48.880]  and I'm not even being a dick.
[33:48.880 --> 33:50.220]  She had her boobies hanging out.
[33:50.220 --> 33:51.900]  She was wearing like a peach colored shirt.
[33:51.900 --> 33:54.020]  She was all tan and had her hair all done.
[33:54.020 --> 33:56.460]  And I looked at my date and I go front row watch.
[33:56.460 --> 33:58.700]  And they got two people out of the front row.
[33:58.700 --> 33:59.980]  They're like, you guys have to move.
[33:59.980 --> 34:02.660]  And they put her and her date front row in the middle.
[34:02.660 --> 34:04.020]  Yeah, it was just funny.
[34:04.020 --> 34:05.260]  And they were just doing it for TV.
[34:05.260 --> 34:06.860]  It was just pretty people up front.
[34:06.860 --> 34:08.380]  They put me under a camera.
[34:08.380 --> 34:11.460]  So there was no chance of that camera getting me.
[34:11.460 --> 34:13.060]  But it was cool because I was the camera
[34:13.060 --> 34:15.860]  that Joe was looking directly into the whole recording.
[34:15.860 --> 34:20.260]  There was a camera like about 20 rows back from the stage.
[34:20.260 --> 34:22.780]  They only did about half the comedy club full that night.
[34:22.780 --> 34:24.140]  It was awesome.
[34:24.140 --> 34:25.500]  But yeah, I'm way ranting,
[34:25.500 --> 34:26.700]  but I had so much fun seeing Joe.
[34:26.700 --> 34:28.220]  It was stressful being at a taping.
[34:28.220 --> 34:31.580]  The rules, they ask you for your phone.
[34:31.580 --> 34:33.740]  Like Comedy Works wants to take your phone from you
[34:33.740 --> 34:36.860]  so that it doesn't ring or go off during the taping.
[34:36.860 --> 34:38.540]  They wouldn't let you wear a hat.
[34:38.540 --> 34:40.700]  They wanted me to cover up my iReed Genetics logo
[34:40.700 --> 34:42.940]  on my shirt, but I didn't do it.
[34:42.940 --> 34:44.820]  Yeah, they did not want logos.
[34:44.820 --> 34:46.660]  They definitely put the three dreadlocked hippies
[34:46.660 --> 34:47.820]  out of camera sight.
[34:47.820 --> 34:48.860]  I thought that was funny.
[34:48.860 --> 34:49.700]  Joe made-
[34:49.700 --> 34:50.620]  Two and a half dreadlocked, no.
[34:50.620 --> 34:52.220]  I'll say, yeah, I'll agree with that.
[34:52.220 --> 34:53.980]  And we're calling Adam as the half dread if you're curious.
[34:54.020 --> 34:55.620]  I'm actually kind of a full dread, sweetie.
[34:55.620 --> 34:58.660]  I heard Michael make that joke the other day.
[34:58.660 --> 34:59.500]  Dude, he's getting there.
[34:59.500 --> 35:00.420]  They're tightening up a little bit.
[35:00.420 --> 35:01.260]  What's up, Adam?
[35:01.260 --> 35:02.820]  He's going to be listening to this show
[35:02.820 --> 35:04.820]  probably Monday morning when it comes out at work.
[35:04.820 --> 35:05.660]  What's up, dude?
[35:05.660 --> 35:06.500]  I hope you get to go to work today.
[35:06.500 --> 35:08.460]  Snow has kind of wrecked everybody's work week.
[35:08.460 --> 35:09.500]  Fuck yeah, it has.
[35:09.500 --> 35:11.300]  It's been snowing for days here, man.
[35:12.940 --> 35:14.660]  I'm the only one with a four wheel drive vehicle
[35:14.660 --> 35:15.620]  that's reliable right now.
[35:15.620 --> 35:17.580]  So I've been playing, I'm not going to say taxi
[35:17.580 --> 35:18.420]  because I don't mind doing it,
[35:18.420 --> 35:19.900]  but it's been nice helping all my friends out.
[35:19.900 --> 35:20.900]  They're stuck.
[35:20.900 --> 35:21.740]  And I'm like, I got you, bro.
[35:21.740 --> 35:22.580]  I'll give you a ride.
[35:22.860 --> 35:23.700]  I'll give you a ride.
[35:23.700 --> 35:24.540]  It's kind of nice.
[35:24.540 --> 35:26.700]  I pulled a chick and her little boyfriend
[35:26.700 --> 35:27.700]  out the other night.
[35:27.700 --> 35:28.540]  Nice.
[35:28.540 --> 35:29.700]  I have a gigantic truck.
[35:29.700 --> 35:30.820]  You do, you do have.
[35:30.820 --> 35:33.820]  Well, no, it's not one of those diesel
[35:33.820 --> 35:37.820]  fucking penile issue things.
[35:38.700 --> 35:40.740]  It's very functional.
[35:40.740 --> 35:42.060]  It's not classy.
[35:42.060 --> 35:42.940]  It's not pretty.
[35:42.940 --> 35:44.300]  It's not a chick getting truck.
[35:44.300 --> 35:46.300]  It's a working man's damn truck.
[35:46.300 --> 35:48.420]  You can deliver soil anywhere in Pueblo
[35:48.420 --> 35:49.900]  or anywhere in Colorado in that truck.
[35:49.900 --> 35:50.740]  Pretty much.
[35:50.740 --> 35:51.820]  The top of Pike's Peak.
[35:52.220 --> 35:53.060]  Easily.
[35:53.060 --> 35:54.140]  Yeah.
[35:54.140 --> 35:55.140]  Yeah.
[35:55.140 --> 35:55.980]  All right.
[35:55.980 --> 35:58.180]  We're driving around like Ken Block.
[35:58.180 --> 35:59.300]  It's how it is around here right now.
[35:59.300 --> 36:00.700]  It's just slushy.
[36:00.700 --> 36:01.540]  Just go slow.
[36:01.540 --> 36:02.660]  You guys will be cool.
[36:02.660 --> 36:04.900]  It seems like nobody's driven in the snow before.
[36:04.900 --> 36:05.740]  Oh yeah.
[36:05.740 --> 36:06.980]  Like you guys are in Colorado.
[36:06.980 --> 36:07.860]  You've done this.
[36:07.860 --> 36:09.380]  It was just a year ago.
[36:09.380 --> 36:10.220]  Not even that.
[36:11.140 --> 36:11.980]  All right, guys,
[36:11.980 --> 36:13.740]  we're going to get back onto building a grow room.
[36:13.740 --> 36:14.660]  We're kind of ranting here.
[36:14.660 --> 36:15.780]  We've had some dabs.
[36:15.780 --> 36:17.060]  I hope you're taking dabs.
[36:17.060 --> 36:19.060]  So if you're building a hydro hut,
[36:19.060 --> 36:20.500]  that's very similar to this setup.
[36:20.540 --> 36:22.740]  I'd run the ducting for the lights.
[36:22.740 --> 36:23.900]  There's a couple of ways to do the lights,
[36:23.900 --> 36:25.140]  but I would run the lights,
[36:25.140 --> 36:26.380]  the ducting straight through the hut
[36:26.380 --> 36:28.620]  so that the light heat never makes it into the hut.
[36:28.620 --> 36:30.140]  There's a hole on the left side
[36:30.140 --> 36:33.140]  and the right side of the huts at the top.
[36:33.140 --> 36:35.340]  Hang the blower inside the hut on one side,
[36:35.340 --> 36:37.020]  run the ducting from the outside,
[36:38.620 --> 36:39.900]  over the blower, over the light,
[36:39.900 --> 36:41.980]  and out of the other side.
[36:41.980 --> 36:43.420]  Yeah, that way the heat,
[36:43.420 --> 36:44.260]  that makes sense.
[36:44.260 --> 36:45.100]  You just make a tunnel right through it.
[36:45.100 --> 36:48.340]  The heat never actually stays inside the grow hut.
[36:48.340 --> 36:49.940]  There's also a little hole in the roof of the huts.
[36:50.300 --> 36:51.140]  I had a blower there.
[36:51.140 --> 36:52.700]  I said, roof, just the roof.
[36:52.700 --> 36:53.540]  That's all the top.
[36:53.540 --> 36:55.620]  I had a blower there to pull fresh air
[36:55.620 --> 36:56.980]  through the hut constantly.
[36:56.980 --> 36:59.020]  I put a carbon filter and a blower inside the hut
[36:59.020 --> 37:00.740]  and fit it out of the top there.
[37:00.740 --> 37:03.780]  It makes the airflow pull air in from the bottom
[37:03.780 --> 37:05.780]  and the heat goes out the top.
[37:05.780 --> 37:06.820]  And always remember,
[37:06.820 --> 37:08.580]  always remember that your blower can pull more air
[37:08.580 --> 37:10.020]  than it can push.
[37:10.020 --> 37:12.460]  I wrote down a lot of shitty half-assed notes right there.
[37:12.460 --> 37:14.460]  None of those notes were full sentences.
[37:14.460 --> 37:17.740]  Blowers work better when they're outside of the room.
[37:17.860 --> 37:21.180]  The same reason you never see the fart fan in the bathroom.
[37:21.180 --> 37:23.100]  It's always mounted up in the ceiling.
[37:23.100 --> 37:25.620]  It's easier to pull air out than it is to push it out.
[37:25.620 --> 37:26.940]  Definitely easier to pull.
[37:28.100 --> 37:29.420]  Here's a question for you.
[37:30.380 --> 37:32.420]  Do you run a carbon filter in tents
[37:32.420 --> 37:34.540]  when you're collecting pollen?
[37:34.540 --> 37:37.540]  You know, I don't because I don't have a blower at all
[37:37.540 --> 37:39.020]  in my tent where I'm collecting pollen.
[37:39.020 --> 37:44.020]  I run when, God, dude, this is crazy secret shit right now.
[37:44.300 --> 37:46.260]  I've got a mail that's in full flower right now.
[37:46.260 --> 37:47.100]  I'm getting ready to do it.
[37:47.460 --> 37:48.460]  It's a genuine quit.
[37:48.460 --> 37:51.020]  So I've got him in his own three by three hut
[37:51.020 --> 37:54.580]  with one coily CFL in there to keep him awake.
[37:54.580 --> 37:56.660]  And that's all because I can't create any heat
[37:56.660 --> 37:58.060]  because I don't want to suck the pollen out.
[37:58.060 --> 37:58.900]  Gotcha.
[37:58.900 --> 37:59.740]  Yeah.
[37:59.740 --> 38:00.740]  So he's just in there with the CFL.
[38:00.740 --> 38:03.900]  You can take a peek when we're done if you want.
[38:03.900 --> 38:06.100]  Maybe you don't want to, there's pollen in there.
[38:06.100 --> 38:07.180]  You'll need a shower.
[38:08.140 --> 38:09.700]  I've always wondered about,
[38:09.700 --> 38:11.580]  I'm flowering one under a thousand.
[38:11.580 --> 38:13.900]  Well, I'm flowering a couple under a thousand watt
[38:13.900 --> 38:14.740]  right now.
[38:15.460 --> 38:18.380]  I think I might be changing that out to a different light.
[38:18.380 --> 38:19.540]  If...
[38:19.540 --> 38:21.220]  Although I want to see their fool.
[38:21.220 --> 38:23.820]  I, here's more shit that I don't tell people.
[38:23.820 --> 38:26.460]  I take a brown paper bag and put it right over the top cola
[38:26.460 --> 38:27.460]  and secure it.
[38:27.460 --> 38:30.500]  And then when I'm sure that I see him,
[38:30.500 --> 38:31.860]  when he's nutting a whole bunch,
[38:31.860 --> 38:33.500]  I just cut that sucker off.
[38:33.500 --> 38:36.140]  And then I have the branch sticking out of the bag
[38:36.140 --> 38:38.300]  and I'll hold it with my hand around the branch
[38:38.300 --> 38:40.300]  and pull the branch out of the bag slowly.
[38:40.300 --> 38:42.540]  And as you pull, you knock everything off into the bag
[38:42.540 --> 38:44.060]  and you just come out with a stick.
[38:44.380 --> 38:45.220]  And then you just clean up the...
[38:45.220 --> 38:46.660]  Yeah, and then I'll clean out all that.
[38:46.660 --> 38:48.060]  Get the wet material out of there.
[38:48.060 --> 38:49.980]  Pour that onto a, I use a drum head actually,
[38:49.980 --> 38:50.980]  an old drum head.
[38:50.980 --> 38:53.140]  Flip it upside down and pour all my shit under there.
[38:53.140 --> 38:53.980]  A bunch of those.
[38:53.980 --> 38:54.820]  Separate, yeah, I had to put,
[38:54.820 --> 38:55.660]  that's how I got the idea.
[38:55.660 --> 38:57.500]  I was like, I'm going to repurpose that shit.
[38:57.500 --> 38:58.340]  But...
[38:58.340 --> 38:59.180]  Nice.
[38:59.180 --> 39:01.380]  So if you leave those in the hut with that bag over there,
[39:01.380 --> 39:02.700]  with the blower on the top,
[39:02.700 --> 39:04.260]  it doesn't steal a lot of your pollen,
[39:04.260 --> 39:06.020]  but it does take some, a little bit,
[39:06.020 --> 39:07.340]  but you're going to make enough.
[39:07.340 --> 39:09.140]  Well, see, I'm also phenol hunting too.
[39:09.140 --> 39:10.500]  I'm not just collecting pollen.
[39:10.500 --> 39:12.340]  Yeah, and I already know that male is who I want.
[39:12.380 --> 39:13.460]  So I just let him sit in there
[39:13.460 --> 39:14.980]  and just jizz away and collect it.
[39:14.980 --> 39:15.820]  For sure.
[39:15.820 --> 39:18.380]  Just circle jerking or bukakian in a bag over there.
[39:18.380 --> 39:19.700]  Yeah.
[39:19.700 --> 39:21.620]  Not just pollen chucking this time.
[39:21.620 --> 39:22.460]  Yeah.
[39:22.460 --> 39:23.580]  Yeah.
[39:23.580 --> 39:26.500]  This male, this is his, the same male,
[39:26.500 --> 39:29.060]  probably his 10th time pollinating shit.
[39:29.060 --> 39:30.100]  A clone of the same male.
[39:30.100 --> 39:31.620]  Not the same guy, but a clone of that one.
[39:31.620 --> 39:33.300]  It's his 10th time hitting stuff.
[39:33.300 --> 39:34.340]  At least.
[39:34.340 --> 39:35.260]  Shoot.
[39:35.260 --> 39:39.140]  My one male that I already have picked out,
[39:39.140 --> 39:40.660]  proven himself and everything.
[39:41.060 --> 39:45.100]  I took clones of him the other day and I took like 25.
[39:45.100 --> 39:46.060]  Nice.
[39:46.060 --> 39:46.900]  Just to make sure.
[39:46.900 --> 39:47.740]  Oh yeah.
[39:47.740 --> 39:48.580]  I will only keep one.
[39:48.580 --> 39:50.420]  But you gotta have one.
[39:50.420 --> 39:51.380]  Yeah.
[39:51.380 --> 39:52.220]  Yeah.
[39:52.220 --> 39:53.780]  I'm excited that all the clones I recently took,
[39:53.780 --> 39:56.020]  they all cut or they all rooted.
[39:56.020 --> 39:58.940]  Most of the seeds I've sprouted are all germinating.
[40:00.260 --> 40:01.940]  Man, I'm working on another project.
[40:01.940 --> 40:04.580]  I am, I don't know if I even want to tell everybody this.
[40:04.580 --> 40:06.940]  I am starting to F2 Black Cherry Kim.
[40:06.940 --> 40:08.700]  I'm doing the phenol hunt to find the male and the female
[40:08.700 --> 40:10.180]  to F2 that.
[40:10.700 --> 40:11.860]  I plan to start the flowering cycle
[40:11.860 --> 40:13.380]  right at the start of the year.
[40:13.380 --> 40:17.500]  So by March 1st-ish, I should have found a good male
[40:17.500 --> 40:19.700]  and a good female that will be used.
[40:19.700 --> 40:23.740]  The clones of those will be ran next to be bred to make.
[40:23.740 --> 40:25.300]  I'll use two females and one male.
[40:25.300 --> 40:27.460]  I'll use a purple female and a non-purple female
[40:27.460 --> 40:29.340]  and see what the progeny make.
[40:29.340 --> 40:31.460]  Definitely a solid purple male.
[40:31.460 --> 40:32.580]  I just want to see if I,
[40:32.580 --> 40:35.420]  cause I may make it recessive
[40:35.420 --> 40:37.060]  if I force too much purple into it.
[40:37.060 --> 40:38.620]  May not come out till the F3
[40:38.660 --> 40:40.420]  if I do that with the two purples.
[40:41.580 --> 40:42.820]  I hope you guys are paying attention to that.
[40:42.820 --> 40:44.700]  That's random shit right there.
[40:44.700 --> 40:48.340]  Also another way that I've been setting up these tents
[40:48.340 --> 40:51.900]  with just one blower, because it seems efficient
[40:51.900 --> 40:53.380]  if you're in a small space.
[40:53.380 --> 40:56.500]  I put the five by five hut with,
[40:56.500 --> 41:00.180]  I do the blower on the roof outside of the hut.
[41:00.180 --> 41:02.340]  It's actually sitting, there's that hole right on top.
[41:02.340 --> 41:04.300]  I just set the blower right on top of there.
[41:04.300 --> 41:06.300]  I run ducting into the hut
[41:06.300 --> 41:09.100]  and then around into the light,
[41:09.100 --> 41:10.740]  fixed the light reflector
[41:10.740 --> 41:13.460]  and then ducting out of the light reflector
[41:13.460 --> 41:14.460]  to a carbon filter.
[41:14.460 --> 41:16.700]  And the carbon filter is hung really high in the hut,
[41:16.700 --> 41:18.140]  as high as you can get it.
[41:18.140 --> 41:19.860]  So now you're filtering the air,
[41:19.860 --> 41:22.900]  pulling out humidity and cooling your light all at one time.
[41:22.900 --> 41:24.700]  And those work great in the garage
[41:24.700 --> 41:26.500]  right now in Colorado in the winter.
[41:26.500 --> 41:28.820]  You need a heater more than you need coolant.
[41:28.820 --> 41:31.140]  You got to put a heater in there at night to keep it warm.
[41:31.140 --> 41:33.220]  But if you've got two of those huts,
[41:33.220 --> 41:34.820]  you could run them side by side
[41:34.820 --> 41:36.500]  and you could vent that heat into the other hut
[41:36.500 --> 41:38.500]  from your light if you thought about how to do it.
[41:38.500 --> 41:39.820]  And CO2.
[41:39.820 --> 41:40.660]  Yeah.
[41:40.660 --> 41:42.300]  Which is soon to be illegal.
[41:42.300 --> 41:43.220]  Yeah.
[41:43.220 --> 41:44.620]  Sleeping plants emit CO2.
[41:44.620 --> 41:46.340]  So if you move your dark,
[41:46.340 --> 41:48.740]  the air from your sleeping room into your awake room,
[41:48.740 --> 41:51.700]  you are moving CO2 to a usable space.
[41:51.700 --> 41:54.780]  That's a definite good hint for people.
[41:54.780 --> 41:58.100]  I wonder if mushroom bags are on that CO2 ban.
[41:58.100 --> 41:59.780]  Sorry to keep harping on that.
[41:59.780 --> 42:01.380]  No, that's a very,
[42:01.380 --> 42:03.380]  I think they're talking about using tanks
[42:03.380 --> 42:04.260]  is what they're afraid of
[42:04.700 --> 42:05.540]  because it's unsafe.
[42:05.540 --> 42:06.740]  Because we have to travel with tanks
[42:06.740 --> 42:09.300]  and we don't have any sort of licensing or anything.
[42:09.300 --> 42:10.140]  Oh, Jesus.
[42:10.140 --> 42:10.980]  But my argument,
[42:10.980 --> 42:13.900]  because I am going to go to city council when this comes up,
[42:13.900 --> 42:15.140]  I'm going to say,
[42:15.140 --> 42:17.260]  this is available at the hydroponic store.
[42:17.260 --> 42:19.460]  Why can the guy growing tomatoes
[42:19.460 --> 42:22.180]  or the guy growing orchids or whatever else he's using,
[42:22.180 --> 42:23.420]  why can he have CO2?
[42:23.420 --> 42:25.620]  And since I'm a cannabis grower, I cannot.
[42:26.660 --> 42:28.740]  I drive around with a bottle of acetylene.
[42:28.740 --> 42:30.900]  You want to talk about something fucking dangerous.
[42:30.900 --> 42:31.740]  Yeah.
[42:31.740 --> 42:32.580]  Yeah.
[42:32.580 --> 42:33.420]  I have no special license.
[42:33.460 --> 42:35.700]  I went down to air gas and they gave it to me.
[42:35.700 --> 42:38.580]  I signed a contract that says I wouldn't damage their bottle
[42:38.580 --> 42:39.900]  but I'm not.
[42:39.900 --> 42:40.740]  That's all they cared about.
[42:40.740 --> 42:41.660]  Don't ruin our container.
[42:41.660 --> 42:42.500]  Yeah.
[42:42.500 --> 42:44.380]  I could blow up a fricking building with that.
[42:44.380 --> 42:46.460]  Not that I'm going to, but.
[42:46.460 --> 42:48.620]  Accidentally you could on accident.
[42:48.620 --> 42:49.460]  Yeah.
[42:49.460 --> 42:50.940]  Yeah.
[42:50.940 --> 42:54.300]  The capability lies there.
[42:56.580 --> 42:57.780]  You'd be the last one to ever do that, bro.
[42:57.780 --> 42:58.620]  Don't worry.
[42:58.620 --> 42:59.460]  I know you just said that.
[42:59.460 --> 43:00.300]  You got paranoid right after you said it.
[43:00.300 --> 43:01.860]  You're like, I can't say that on the air, can I?
[43:01.860 --> 43:02.900]  I can't say that shit.
[43:03.860 --> 43:05.140]  Yeah.
[43:05.140 --> 43:07.700]  There's so many more dangerous things out there than.
[43:07.700 --> 43:08.540]  Yeah.
[43:08.540 --> 43:09.460]  Anyways, yeah.
[43:09.460 --> 43:10.300]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[43:10.300 --> 43:11.980]  Let's save this for Mike.
[43:11.980 --> 43:12.820]  Save this for Mike.
[43:12.820 --> 43:15.060]  Mike, we need you back on the show here in a week or two
[43:15.060 --> 43:16.300]  because you've been going to those meetings.
[43:16.300 --> 43:17.140]  Dude, thanks a lot.
[43:17.140 --> 43:17.980]  That is not my thing.
[43:17.980 --> 43:18.900]  I'm so glad you're going.
[43:18.900 --> 43:21.140]  But we need you to come update us with what's going on
[43:21.140 --> 43:22.420]  in our community and what kind of rules
[43:22.420 --> 43:23.820]  they're trying to enforce on us.
[43:23.820 --> 43:27.060]  I wanted to go the other night, but fucking weather.
[43:27.060 --> 43:28.980]  The weather and the growers have been busy.
[43:28.980 --> 43:30.700]  That was a night that got shitty.
[43:30.700 --> 43:31.780]  Yeah.
[43:31.820 --> 43:34.300]  It went from like, ooh, it's kind of chilly out
[43:34.300 --> 43:36.540]  to oh my God, it's snowing instantly.
[43:36.540 --> 43:38.740]  Yeah, I think I was wearing shorts that day.
[43:38.740 --> 43:41.020]  Yeah, it was like 60 degrees.
[43:41.020 --> 43:45.580]  And within an hour, it was just fucking damn near freezing.
[43:45.580 --> 43:47.540]  Minus six was cold the other night.
[43:47.540 --> 43:48.700]  I was driving home.
[43:48.700 --> 43:50.580]  It was nice and cold at minus six.
[43:50.580 --> 43:51.900]  It's fricking cold right now, man.
[43:51.900 --> 43:54.700]  It was coming down like crazy out there.
[43:54.700 --> 43:56.700]  I'm getting better at it.
[43:56.700 --> 43:58.260]  Once you're prepared, the first few winter,
[43:58.260 --> 43:59.140]  I'm from California, dude.
[43:59.140 --> 44:00.900]  When I first moved here, winter killed me.
[44:00.940 --> 44:02.900]  And now I don't get, I'm gonna knock on wood,
[44:02.900 --> 44:04.620]  I don't get sick like I used to.
[44:04.620 --> 44:06.260]  When I first moved here, I'd get terribly sick
[44:06.260 --> 44:07.300]  every winter just because I didn't know
[44:07.300 --> 44:09.020]  what to do with minus six.
[44:09.020 --> 44:10.220]  I have to go to school.
[44:11.700 --> 44:12.540]  What do you do?
[44:12.540 --> 44:14.060]  How do you even dress for this?
[44:14.060 --> 44:16.940]  You gotta dress like it's Antarctica to get to school.
[44:16.940 --> 44:19.220]  And then when you get to school, it's 77 in the classroom.
[44:19.220 --> 44:20.620]  So now you're sweating your ass off.
[44:20.620 --> 44:22.380]  I had to learn how to adjust without getting sick.
[44:22.380 --> 44:23.820]  It was weird.
[44:23.820 --> 44:26.380]  I'm from Durango, so I've been used to it.
[44:26.380 --> 44:28.020]  Oh yeah.
[44:28.020 --> 44:29.900]  Living in Pueblo softened me up.
[44:29.940 --> 44:32.820]  So this is like, whoa.
[44:32.820 --> 44:34.700]  I think these, we were talking about this earlier.
[44:34.700 --> 44:37.900]  These generations are getting softer as we go.
[44:37.900 --> 44:39.180]  We were talking about a doctor.
[44:39.180 --> 44:41.020]  Our good buddy Spence had his appendix removed
[44:41.020 --> 44:43.060]  and Jesse was kind enough to post a meme
[44:43.060 --> 44:45.300]  of a doctor removing his own damn appendix
[44:45.300 --> 44:46.700]  on Spencer's Facebook.
[44:46.700 --> 44:47.660]  That's pretty cute.
[44:48.500 --> 44:50.460]  But this generation, I don't know how many people
[44:50.460 --> 44:52.500]  would just reach down and remove their own appendix.
[44:52.500 --> 44:53.820]  We're too entitled.
[44:53.820 --> 44:55.500]  Shouldn't somebody else do this?
[44:57.900 --> 44:59.340]  It's kind of where we are.
[44:59.340 --> 45:01.740]  Guys, if you have more questions about a hydro hut,
[45:01.740 --> 45:02.780]  I'm pretty good at them.
[45:02.780 --> 45:04.580]  I just don't know what to say.
[45:04.580 --> 45:06.500]  If you got a question, I can set up your hydro hut
[45:06.500 --> 45:07.340]  like a champ.
[45:07.340 --> 45:08.980]  I can give you a lot of advice on that.
[45:10.260 --> 45:13.460]  Bracing, sometimes these hoods and you get a carbon filter
[45:13.460 --> 45:16.020]  and a blower and everything hung up there.
[45:16.020 --> 45:18.020]  Easy ways to brace it.
[45:18.020 --> 45:19.020]  That's a good idea.
[45:19.020 --> 45:24.020]  Go buy some PVC and just fricking tape it really tight
[45:24.540 --> 45:27.980]  or tie it to the other roof beams.
[45:28.340 --> 45:30.540]  It'll give you a little structure up there.
[45:30.540 --> 45:33.300]  I've seen someone screw up.
[45:33.300 --> 45:34.500]  They had a four by four hut,
[45:34.500 --> 45:36.580]  so they took a four by four piece of plywood
[45:36.580 --> 45:39.420]  and screwed it to the roof on the outside.
[45:39.420 --> 45:41.740]  And that really, really strengthened that.
[45:41.740 --> 45:45.180]  Man, the dude could have stood on the top of it.
[45:45.180 --> 45:46.020]  Nice.
[45:46.020 --> 45:46.860]  They are a little rickety.
[45:46.860 --> 45:47.900]  They're a little wobbly.
[45:47.900 --> 45:50.100]  If you're putting a heavy,
[45:50.100 --> 45:52.180]  if you don't have the right carbon filter,
[45:52.180 --> 45:53.460]  the good carbon filters are heavy.
[45:53.460 --> 45:55.220]  They sell lighter ones that are more expensive.
[45:55.220 --> 45:56.300]  If you don't have that one,
[45:56.300 --> 45:57.780]  you're putting a lot of weight up there.
[45:57.780 --> 45:59.140]  A light is expensive.
[45:59.140 --> 46:01.780]  If you're hanging like a triple XL Raptor,
[46:01.780 --> 46:02.980]  that's some heavy shit.
[46:03.980 --> 46:06.460]  You probably don't need one of those in a tent.
[46:06.460 --> 46:08.980]  Just a little, you know, tent there.
[46:10.260 --> 46:14.020]  What are the eight inch sun?
[46:15.540 --> 46:17.940]  Oh, sun stars.
[46:17.940 --> 46:18.780]  No.
[46:18.780 --> 46:20.260]  Yeah, I know exactly which reflectors I love.
[46:20.260 --> 46:21.500]  And the Radian sixes.
[46:21.500 --> 46:22.340]  Oh yeah, those are cool.
[46:22.340 --> 46:23.260]  The Radian six or the Radian eight.
[46:23.260 --> 46:24.420]  It's about the size of a shoe box.
[46:24.420 --> 46:25.260]  It's nice and light.
[46:25.260 --> 46:26.100]  Those are great.
[46:26.900 --> 46:28.260]  I think instead of a big wide reflector,
[46:28.260 --> 46:30.580]  a little reflector is better because,
[46:30.580 --> 46:33.060]  and you can make a sexual joke out of this if you want,
[46:33.060 --> 46:34.380]  but I want it to go deeper.
[46:34.380 --> 46:35.780]  I don't want it so wide.
[46:37.060 --> 46:39.540]  I want my light to penetrate the canopy a little more.
[46:39.540 --> 46:40.700]  Yeah, I was gonna say you get better penetration.
[46:40.700 --> 46:42.500]  Yeah, I want more penetration.
[46:42.500 --> 46:44.140]  I don't need you tearing it apart so wide.
[46:44.140 --> 46:44.980]  Go deeper.
[46:44.980 --> 46:47.820]  It's still, I mean, you got a thousand watts
[46:47.820 --> 46:49.140]  is a thousand watts.
[46:49.140 --> 46:52.500]  So if your reflector spreading it out to a five by five area
[46:52.500 --> 46:54.140]  or you have a reflector spreading it out
[46:54.140 --> 46:55.660]  to a three by three area,
[46:56.220 --> 46:59.820]  which reflector you're gonna get a better value
[46:59.820 --> 47:01.180]  for that thousand watts from.
[47:01.180 --> 47:03.380]  And in my opinion, it's gonna be the three by three
[47:03.380 --> 47:04.220]  every time.
[47:04.220 --> 47:05.060]  Absolutely.
[47:05.060 --> 47:07.180]  And in those huts, those huts are very well made
[47:07.180 --> 47:09.220]  with that reflective material in there.
[47:09.220 --> 47:11.740]  I feel like I get a lot more lumens out of those huts
[47:11.740 --> 47:13.500]  than I do the open rooms that I run.
[47:14.460 --> 47:15.780]  For sure.
[47:15.780 --> 47:17.740]  They take better pictures too.
[47:17.740 --> 47:18.660]  Yeah, they sure do.
[47:18.660 --> 47:20.340]  They got that sexy background in there.
[47:20.340 --> 47:21.180]  All right.
[47:21.180 --> 47:22.300]  So most of this is the same.
[47:22.300 --> 47:23.780]  If you're working in a bedroom or a closet,
[47:23.820 --> 47:25.940]  just on a smaller scale,
[47:25.940 --> 47:29.140]  if you can't cut holes for ducting, try using a window.
[47:29.140 --> 47:31.500]  We kind of talked about tricking you on the windows.
[47:31.500 --> 47:35.020]  Once again, use some of that blue foam board.
[47:35.020 --> 47:36.220]  I don't, I think it's for insulation.
[47:36.220 --> 47:37.580]  They got it at Lowe's.
[47:37.580 --> 47:41.020]  Cut that to size, pop that in your window with some duct tape.
[47:41.020 --> 47:42.940]  If you need to cut holes out of that,
[47:42.940 --> 47:45.820]  I take, actually I use a pre-made six inch
[47:45.820 --> 47:48.340]  or eight inch flange that's used for a blower.
[47:48.340 --> 47:51.300]  And I set that on that blue foam board and I just step on it
[47:51.300 --> 47:52.740]  and that's how I cut holes in my foam board.
[47:52.740 --> 47:54.180]  Perfect sizes for my ducts.
[47:54.180 --> 47:55.020]  Nice.
[47:55.020 --> 47:56.220]  Yeah, put your shoe on and step on it.
[47:56.220 --> 47:57.220]  This is that you don't cut the-
[47:57.220 --> 47:59.060]  Take off flange.
[47:59.060 --> 48:00.020]  Yeah.
[48:00.020 --> 48:01.940]  And then you gotta, you gotta knock that out
[48:01.940 --> 48:02.900]  because it gets stuck in there.
[48:02.900 --> 48:04.460]  So you gotta use something to punch it out.
[48:04.460 --> 48:05.300]  Yeah.
[48:05.300 --> 48:06.140]  It's kind of fun.
[48:06.140 --> 48:09.740]  And that's a nice little life hack
[48:09.740 --> 48:11.500]  is the popular new term on that.
[48:11.500 --> 48:12.340]  Yeah.
[48:12.340 --> 48:13.180]  Or a room hack.
[48:13.180 --> 48:16.260]  Instead of trying to cut, just be lazy and stomp it out.
[48:16.260 --> 48:17.620]  I always use a drywall saw
[48:17.620 --> 48:19.820]  and make a gigantic mess everywhere.
[48:19.820 --> 48:20.660]  Oh yeah.
[48:20.660 --> 48:22.380]  That blue, when you cut that blue foam board,
[48:23.020 --> 48:24.420]  it's gonna make a gigantic foamy mess everywhere
[48:24.420 --> 48:26.500]  and it'll clog up your saws like nothing other.
[48:26.500 --> 48:27.340]  Oh yeah.
[48:27.340 --> 48:28.620]  And it gets real hot.
[48:30.220 --> 48:31.960]  Yeah, disguise your out ducts.
[48:32.860 --> 48:35.620]  If you can duct it out of the attic or a chimney,
[48:35.620 --> 48:37.220]  that's awesome.
[48:37.220 --> 48:38.300]  You don't want your neighbors seeing,
[48:38.300 --> 48:40.220]  it's minus six outside right now
[48:40.220 --> 48:42.060]  where my heat is dumping outside.
[48:42.060 --> 48:44.620]  I'm pretty sure it's making steam.
[48:44.620 --> 48:45.460]  Yeah.
[48:45.460 --> 48:46.300]  Yeah.
[48:46.300 --> 48:48.100]  No matter, even if it's 20 degrees,
[48:48.100 --> 48:50.620]  it'll probably make steam dumping into minus six.
[48:50.620 --> 48:53.580]  So they can see your air coming out of your grow space
[48:53.580 --> 48:56.460]  at 80 degrees coming out of the lights.
[48:56.460 --> 48:57.900]  Yeah, I've seen that before.
[48:59.340 --> 49:00.860]  Melting snow off the roof.
[49:01.780 --> 49:03.300]  There was a guy in another neighborhood
[49:03.300 --> 49:04.980]  that a friend of mine and I used to make fun of
[49:04.980 --> 49:06.460]  because every morning at seven o'clock
[49:06.460 --> 49:08.100]  you could see the blower click in
[49:08.100 --> 49:10.540]  and the one section would clear from the snow
[49:10.540 --> 49:11.780]  and then about 30 minutes later,
[49:11.780 --> 49:13.420]  one side of the roof would be all clear.
[49:13.420 --> 49:14.900]  I'm like, that's where his grow space is.
[49:14.900 --> 49:17.180]  You can see it in the attic right up there.
[49:17.180 --> 49:18.020]  All right.
[49:18.020 --> 49:19.460]  So you got all your automation.
[49:19.460 --> 49:20.480]  You've got everything ducted.
[49:21.340 --> 49:22.180]  We've got lights going.
[49:22.180 --> 49:23.000]  We've got timers.
[49:24.040 --> 49:25.340]  Man, it's almost time to add plants.
[49:25.340 --> 49:28.120]  I would say, get everything set up, run the room,
[49:28.120 --> 49:29.440]  set all of your timers and everything,
[49:29.440 --> 49:30.400]  run a cycle or two,
[49:30.400 --> 49:31.880]  make sure your air conditioner kicks in
[49:31.880 --> 49:33.040]  when it gets too hot.
[49:33.040 --> 49:35.760]  Make sure the lights go off and on as planned.
[49:35.760 --> 49:37.180]  Pay attention to the temps and humidity
[49:37.180 --> 49:38.840]  without the plants in the room.
[49:38.840 --> 49:42.360]  And this is the time to make corrections if you need to.
[49:42.360 --> 49:43.800]  Also keep in mind,
[49:43.800 --> 49:47.120]  an empty room runs hotter than a room full of plants.
[49:47.120 --> 49:50.120]  And plants absorb heat and energy.
[49:50.760 --> 49:53.360]  And it will also be less humid without plants.
[49:53.360 --> 49:55.080]  So it's gonna be hotter.
[49:55.080 --> 49:55.920]  Yeah.
[49:55.920 --> 49:56.960]  So when I put plants in, the plants are gonna cool it.
[49:56.960 --> 49:57.800]  Yeah.
[49:59.520 --> 50:01.960]  Do you have a guess if I were running this eight by eight
[50:01.960 --> 50:04.480]  room, how many degrees my plants are gonna drop it?
[50:04.480 --> 50:05.320]  No.
[50:05.320 --> 50:06.400]  Okay.
[50:06.400 --> 50:07.480]  He's completely right.
[50:07.480 --> 50:09.720]  But I thought he may have done more thought on that.
[50:09.720 --> 50:11.440]  I've noticed it, but I don't know.
[50:11.440 --> 50:13.040]  And I also know that when I'm in there,
[50:13.040 --> 50:14.440]  I heat the room up ridiculously.
[50:14.440 --> 50:15.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:15.280 --> 50:16.100]  I've noticed that too.
[50:16.100 --> 50:16.940]  Like so fast.
[50:16.940 --> 50:19.840]  I've really noticed it mostly on tents.
[50:20.600 --> 50:21.520]  Actually, you know what?
[50:21.520 --> 50:23.640]  I've noticed it on gigantic rooms too.
[50:24.920 --> 50:26.720]  It varies.
[50:26.720 --> 50:28.320]  It's at least a couple of degrees.
[50:28.320 --> 50:29.920]  I bet the dirt can hold a shit ton of heat.
[50:29.920 --> 50:30.760]  Oh yeah, that shit can.
[50:30.760 --> 50:31.600]  Yeah.
[50:31.600 --> 50:32.840]  Kinda.
[50:32.840 --> 50:36.000]  And reservoirs, you know, they'll hold heat too.
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.200]  Water reservoirs.
[50:37.200 --> 50:38.040]  Yeah.
[50:38.040 --> 50:40.240]  Yeah, so that's how we heat greenhouses.
[50:40.240 --> 50:42.760]  I was gonna say, I've seen you guys put big jugs of water
[50:42.760 --> 50:44.800]  in the sun and then haul it into the greenhouse at night
[50:44.800 --> 50:46.000]  to keep them warm.
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  My friend Ryan actually was heating bricks in his oven.
[50:49.040 --> 50:51.440]  He would put a big, like a pot of bricks.
[50:51.440 --> 50:53.280]  Like he was just making a pot roast full of bricks
[50:53.280 --> 50:54.760]  and he'd heat those up and then go outside
[50:54.760 --> 50:56.680]  and cover the plants in a tarp
[50:56.680 --> 50:58.800]  and then put the hot bricks underneath the tarp.
[50:58.800 --> 50:59.640]  Fuck yeah.
[50:59.640 --> 51:02.000]  He just harvested like a week ago in Colorado.
[51:02.000 --> 51:02.840]  Nice.
[51:02.840 --> 51:03.660]  Yeah, outdoors.
[51:03.660 --> 51:05.560]  Speaking of all these cold weathers,
[51:07.360 --> 51:10.360]  God, let's go down to Walmart's.
[51:14.020 --> 51:17.520]  My greenhouse, I harvested all the plants right before
[51:17.520 --> 51:19.020]  it got freezing cold in it.
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.920]  But I had a couple of containers with lettuce and spinach
[51:22.920 --> 51:24.600]  and radish and onions.
[51:25.640 --> 51:28.920]  And I'm super stoked that with my little tiny heater
[51:28.920 --> 51:32.000]  and my little greenhouse, the spinach made it through.
[51:32.000 --> 51:33.400]  So did some of the lettuce.
[51:33.400 --> 51:34.320]  Nice.
[51:34.320 --> 51:35.760]  Everything else is frozen.
[51:35.760 --> 51:36.600]  Frozen.
[51:36.600 --> 51:37.440]  Fucking dead, but.
[51:37.440 --> 51:38.800]  Frozen vegetables already.
[51:38.800 --> 51:39.640]  Yeah.
[51:40.760 --> 51:43.600]  All right guys, we're getting 50 minutes in here.
[51:43.600 --> 51:44.440]  Yeah, run your rooms.
[51:44.440 --> 51:45.280]  That's what I'm gonna say.
[51:45.280 --> 51:46.120]  Run the rooms.
[51:46.120 --> 51:46.960]  Run that bad bitch.
[51:47.400 --> 51:48.440]  Run it and then once everything is cool,
[51:48.440 --> 51:49.640]  then you can put plants in there
[51:49.640 --> 51:51.260]  and then you're gonna have to make a couple of adjustments
[51:51.260 --> 51:52.880]  once you put plants in there.
[51:52.880 --> 51:54.440]  Yeah, for sure.
[51:54.440 --> 51:55.920]  If you're just vegging, you're fine.
[51:55.920 --> 51:58.080]  You can tweak around with your rooms while you're vegging.
[51:58.080 --> 51:59.680]  You're not gonna piss the plants off too much.
[51:59.680 --> 52:01.100]  As soon as you start flower,
[52:01.100 --> 52:02.920]  you have to be really, really careful
[52:02.920 --> 52:04.000]  with your photo periods.
[52:04.000 --> 52:04.980]  That's your light cycle.
[52:04.980 --> 52:06.360]  We call that photo period.
[52:06.360 --> 52:08.120]  We're gonna start saying photo period all the time
[52:08.120 --> 52:09.320]  and leave out the word light cycles
[52:09.320 --> 52:11.640]  because photo period is appropriate and proper.
[52:12.560 --> 52:15.680]  If you interrupt your photo period on a flowering plant,
[52:15.680 --> 52:18.280]  it will possibly revert back to veg
[52:18.280 --> 52:19.880]  and it will probably hermaphrodite
[52:19.880 --> 52:21.360]  and you're running a good chance
[52:21.360 --> 52:23.320]  of making some seeds out of that on accident
[52:23.320 --> 52:24.320]  that you don't want.
[52:24.320 --> 52:26.320]  So don't mess with your photo period.
[52:26.320 --> 52:27.520]  Keep that solid.
[52:27.520 --> 52:29.080]  Yeah, leave the seeds to us.
[52:29.080 --> 52:30.920]  No, no, no.
[52:30.920 --> 52:31.760]  Just kidding.
[52:31.760 --> 52:32.580]  Please do.
[52:32.580 --> 52:35.360]  If you've got a good breeding project, keep it going.
[52:35.360 --> 52:36.200]  Okay, props to you.
[52:36.200 --> 52:38.920]  I used to be really kind of secretive
[52:38.920 --> 52:41.520]  and I didn't like to share my breeding information
[52:41.520 --> 52:42.760]  because I feel like I'll teach you how to grow
[52:42.760 --> 52:44.920]  but breeding, you gotta get a good grasp on breed,
[52:44.960 --> 52:46.320]  on growing and once you've got that,
[52:46.320 --> 52:48.040]  then you'll kind of learn how to breed
[52:48.040 --> 52:49.600]  with that on accident.
[52:49.600 --> 52:50.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[52:51.600 --> 52:53.000]  But I kind of been sharing a little bit
[52:53.000 --> 52:53.880]  of my breeding secrets.
[52:53.880 --> 52:55.640]  So if you guys have a specific question,
[52:55.640 --> 52:57.560]  I'd rather help you than just watch you fail.
[52:57.560 --> 52:58.440]  That's how I feel about it.
[52:58.440 --> 53:01.040]  You're gonna do it, so why not help you do it right?
[53:01.040 --> 53:03.880]  When I first got started, I won't mention any names,
[53:03.880 --> 53:06.120]  but I hit up a couple of guys,
[53:07.160 --> 53:09.360]  you know, just with some basic questions
[53:09.360 --> 53:12.680]  and I got told to, you know, fuck off basically.
[53:12.680 --> 53:16.000]  So always kind of disheartened me.
[53:16.000 --> 53:16.840]  Yeah.
[53:16.840 --> 53:17.680]  But it also encouraged me.
[53:17.680 --> 53:19.640]  I was like, screw these guys, I can do this.
[53:19.640 --> 53:20.840]  Right.
[53:20.840 --> 53:22.360]  Just taking a little time to research stuff
[53:22.360 --> 53:24.000]  and read it on your own goes a long way.
[53:24.000 --> 53:24.840]  Oh yeah.
[53:24.840 --> 53:25.960]  The internet is great, but,
[53:25.960 --> 53:28.640]  and I've been banned from so many forums and chat rooms
[53:28.640 --> 53:30.400]  because the internet is full of shit
[53:30.400 --> 53:32.160]  and people will type whatever they want
[53:32.160 --> 53:34.200]  without knowing what they're talking about.
[53:34.200 --> 53:36.920]  And I feel that that sucks because it causes problems.
[53:36.920 --> 53:38.400]  That's part of what inspired this show
[53:38.400 --> 53:39.760]  was reading shit on the internet going,
[53:39.760 --> 53:41.400]  dude, I hope nobody tried that.
[53:41.400 --> 53:43.720]  Or actually seeing somebody ask his friend a question
[53:43.720 --> 53:45.520]  on a forum that sounds like troll it up,
[53:45.520 --> 53:46.440]  but it's not troll it up.
[53:46.440 --> 53:47.280]  It's very similar.
[53:47.280 --> 53:49.240]  I've been banned, so I won't advertise the site,
[53:49.240 --> 53:51.480]  but on troll it up, somebody asked a question
[53:51.480 --> 53:54.080]  and the guy replied with a totally bullshit answer
[53:54.080 --> 53:55.200]  to his friend.
[53:55.200 --> 53:56.120]  And he's like, awesome, man.
[53:56.120 --> 53:57.240]  I'm going to try it today.
[53:57.240 --> 53:58.160]  And I'm like, dude, don't,
[53:58.160 --> 54:00.020]  your friend just killed your whole crop.
[54:00.020 --> 54:02.440]  However many plants you have, they're dead if you do that.
[54:02.440 --> 54:03.720]  And that's part of what inspired this.
[54:03.720 --> 54:05.320]  I wanted to get people that know what they're doing
[54:05.320 --> 54:08.200]  to come and put a good voice out for cannabis.
[54:08.200 --> 54:13.200]  There's a thing on the probiotics farmers alliance,
[54:13.360 --> 54:16.180]  a pin, it's the very first post if you ever join it.
[54:17.200 --> 54:20.320]  I can't quote it for verbatim, but by any means,
[54:20.320 --> 54:24.280]  but it just says essentially,
[54:24.280 --> 54:29.160]  don't make something fact just because you believe.
[54:29.160 --> 54:30.240]  Okay, yeah.
[54:30.240 --> 54:33.840]  I can't really recreate it, but yeah, it's just,
[54:35.360 --> 54:37.880]  there's so much shit out there and people just type shit
[54:38.560 --> 54:40.600]  and they believe it and they're full of shit themselves.
[54:40.600 --> 54:42.840]  And what worked for them may not work for you.
[54:42.840 --> 54:44.960]  Your situation could be totally different.
[54:44.960 --> 54:46.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[54:46.400 --> 54:48.060]  I don't think I'm a member of that group anymore.
[54:48.060 --> 54:50.360]  So I won't be able to see it.
[54:50.360 --> 54:52.080]  I had to leave that group because they put up too much stuff
[54:52.080 --> 54:53.160]  and I got way too many.
[54:53.160 --> 54:56.320]  Yeah, I mean, it's a great place, but yeah.
[54:56.320 --> 54:58.840]  Yeah, I'm not in the group, so I can't view their stuff,
[54:58.840 --> 55:00.760]  but still good group.
[55:00.760 --> 55:02.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[55:02.200 --> 55:03.380]  Allen Atkinson.
[55:05.360 --> 55:07.760]  It's a lot of the gauge green genetics group too.
[55:08.520 --> 55:10.600]  Man, they're sharing incredible knowledge.
[55:10.600 --> 55:11.440]  That's-
[55:11.440 --> 55:12.400]  And incredible genetics.
[55:12.400 --> 55:14.080]  The stuff Gage Green has been putting out lately
[55:14.080 --> 55:15.000]  is super impressive.
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.920]  I actually breed with a Gage Green genetics Daybreaker male.
[55:17.920 --> 55:19.520]  So that's how much I liked that shit.
[55:19.520 --> 55:21.760]  I've made my own F2 Daybreaker male to use
[55:21.760 --> 55:24.400]  so that I don't have to use Gage's original workings.
[55:24.400 --> 55:25.720]  I have two days to have my own.
[55:25.720 --> 55:27.600]  Yeah, it's a good strain.
[55:27.600 --> 55:29.560]  Adam was here the other night and I cut down
[55:29.560 --> 55:32.560]  nine Daybreaker plants that were about three feet tall.
[55:32.560 --> 55:33.400]  Nice.
[55:33.400 --> 55:35.000]  Just eugenics, basically.
[55:35.000 --> 55:36.800]  They weren't for what I needed for that project
[55:36.800 --> 55:38.560]  and he didn't know what to think, dude.
[55:38.560 --> 55:41.400]  He's not an avid pot gardener.
[55:41.400 --> 55:43.120]  I was like, hold this trash bag open for me.
[55:43.120 --> 55:44.200]  And he's like, what are you gonna do?
[55:44.200 --> 55:45.640]  And I was like, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.
[55:45.640 --> 55:46.840]  And he just went, ugh.
[55:46.840 --> 55:47.820]  He told me I made him sick.
[55:47.820 --> 55:49.520]  He's like, my heart's broken, man.
[55:54.320 --> 55:56.480]  Last spring, I had a plant that got some mold
[55:56.480 --> 55:59.520]  and I didn't notice it till we were trimming it.
[55:59.520 --> 56:02.760]  And I saw it, threw the freaking thing away.
[56:02.760 --> 56:05.520]  And the guy that was helping me trim,
[56:05.520 --> 56:08.880]  I'm pretty sure he wanted to go take it to the trash can.
[56:08.880 --> 56:09.720]  I just threw it in dirt.
[56:09.720 --> 56:11.320]  I was like, dude, I'm not, no.
[56:11.320 --> 56:12.360]  No, it's just.
[56:12.360 --> 56:15.100]  I had a, like your situation,
[56:15.100 --> 56:17.680]  I had a white rhino plant that had to be five ounces.
[56:17.680 --> 56:19.160]  It's a seven gallon pot.
[56:19.160 --> 56:20.840]  The top cola was as big as a football.
[56:20.840 --> 56:22.320]  It was the size of this Gatorade bottle.
[56:22.320 --> 56:23.160]  Oh, Jesus.
[56:23.160 --> 56:24.920]  And it was this season of the year.
[56:24.920 --> 56:26.480]  So there was a lot of cold in the air.
[56:26.480 --> 56:28.720]  And I was like, that plant, I know it already.
[56:28.720 --> 56:29.920]  And I kept checking it, nothing.
[56:29.920 --> 56:30.840]  Kept checking it, nothing.
[56:30.840 --> 56:32.400]  At harvest time, the center of one bud
[56:32.400 --> 56:34.040]  had mildew all up the middle.
[56:34.040 --> 56:35.280]  And I threw the whole plant away
[56:36.040 --> 56:37.240]  because I didn't want to go fish through every bud.
[56:37.240 --> 56:39.720]  And my trimmer buddy, Mike, it was Mike at the time.
[56:39.720 --> 56:41.520]  We were just kind of new friends at the time.
[56:41.520 --> 56:43.360]  I just put a trash bag over it and threw it all away.
[56:43.360 --> 56:44.840]  And he's like, the whole thing, bro?
[56:44.840 --> 56:47.600]  And I was like, yeah, we can't mess with that.
[56:47.600 --> 56:50.480]  That's the difference between a pot farmer and a caregiver.
[56:50.480 --> 56:51.680]  I'm growing medical weed.
[56:51.680 --> 56:52.760]  The person that would have sold that
[56:52.760 --> 56:55.000]  is just growing shitty weed for money.
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.400]  Oh, and then also, I mean, yeah,
[56:56.400 --> 56:58.760]  there's just so many reasons to throw it away.
[56:59.680 --> 57:01.600]  I don't like failure, so.
[57:01.600 --> 57:03.520]  I don't want to keep a moldy plant around my house
[57:03.520 --> 57:05.120]  to spread mold spores even more.
[57:05.960 --> 57:07.880]  You know, just screw it.
[57:07.880 --> 57:09.240]  Yeah, take some pride in what you do, guys.
[57:09.240 --> 57:11.000]  You're working really hard at growing cannabis.
[57:11.000 --> 57:11.840]  Do it right.
[57:11.840 --> 57:12.880]  Don't make people sicker.
[57:12.880 --> 57:14.760]  Make people feel better.
[57:14.760 --> 57:15.800]  All right, I feel like we went over
[57:15.800 --> 57:18.600]  a whole bunch of information in kind of a scattered way.
[57:19.480 --> 57:21.160]  Keep your plants off the ground.
[57:21.160 --> 57:23.000]  Yeah, keep your plants off the ground,
[57:23.000 --> 57:24.920]  especially in this cold weather.
[57:24.920 --> 57:28.360]  Keep everything off the concrete floor you can.
[57:28.360 --> 57:31.040]  That's your nutrients, your water reservoir.
[57:31.040 --> 57:32.400]  Clone trays, most definitely.
[57:32.400 --> 57:33.720]  Oh, yeah.
[57:33.720 --> 57:35.120]  Unless you're running an EZ-Cloner
[57:35.120 --> 57:36.640]  and you need that cool water.
[57:36.640 --> 57:37.560]  True, true.
[57:38.920 --> 57:41.120]  But if you figure that out,
[57:42.400 --> 57:43.800]  you're probably one of those guys
[57:43.800 --> 57:46.560]  that's just getting entertainment here, so.
[57:46.560 --> 57:48.600]  Yeah.
[57:48.600 --> 57:49.720]  Which is cool, thank you.
[57:49.720 --> 57:50.760]  Yeah, thanks for listening, guys.
[57:50.760 --> 57:53.320]  We're gonna definitely get more advanced as we go.
[57:53.320 --> 57:54.800]  We're 40 episodes in.
[57:54.800 --> 57:56.520]  You guys are learning stuff now.
[57:56.520 --> 57:58.200]  I'm learning stuff now because I have to read
[57:58.200 --> 57:59.320]  just to make sure I don't lie to you
[57:59.320 --> 58:00.880]  because I made a mistake on the show one time
[58:00.880 --> 58:02.160]  and I felt really stupid.
[58:02.160 --> 58:03.440]  I don't want to go teaching wrong shit.
[58:04.120 --> 58:05.760]  I definitely had to come back and correct myself.
[58:05.760 --> 58:07.360]  So I've been making sure to read everything
[58:07.360 --> 58:08.200]  and stay on top.
[58:08.200 --> 58:09.200]  I'm reading more about nutrients
[58:09.200 --> 58:10.920]  because I know about nutrients,
[58:10.920 --> 58:12.240]  but you get so comfortable
[58:12.240 --> 58:13.760]  that you don't even pay attention anymore.
[58:13.760 --> 58:15.480]  I'm like, yeah, I know when I look at that plant,
[58:15.480 --> 58:16.800]  that's a phosphorus deficiency.
[58:16.800 --> 58:19.600]  I need to give it some phosphorus and I just get in there.
[58:19.600 --> 58:22.320]  I'm gonna have to kind of brush up a little bit more.
[58:22.320 --> 58:24.720]  Yeah, I need to do a little homework.
[58:24.720 --> 58:26.720]  I should be doing that anyway, honestly,
[58:26.720 --> 58:29.400]  with my profession, but yeah.
[58:29.400 --> 58:31.720]  Yeah, those times when you're sitting there in the store
[58:31.760 --> 58:34.280]  and you're ready to pull your beard out, just grab a book.
[58:34.280 --> 58:35.400]  Yeah.
[58:35.400 --> 58:36.680]  You've got the internet there.
[58:36.680 --> 58:38.160]  Yeah, no, I've got a,
[58:38.160 --> 58:39.800]  I actually got a couple of books down there.
[58:39.800 --> 58:40.640]  Nice.
[58:40.640 --> 58:45.640]  HydroFarm sent us a free book for employees and stuff.
[58:45.920 --> 58:46.800]  It's kind of cool.
[58:48.160 --> 58:50.480]  One of our other employees is reading it right now,
[58:50.480 --> 58:52.640]  but I can't wait to go over it.
[58:52.640 --> 58:55.440]  It's just about indoor hydroponic gardening.
[58:55.440 --> 58:56.280]  Nice.
[58:56.280 --> 58:58.160]  You know, not pot specific or anything.
[58:58.160 --> 58:59.000]  Grow rooms are grow rooms.
[58:59.000 --> 59:00.200]  Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:00.240 --> 59:02.640]  Yeah, and HydroFarm's afraid of the cannabis industry.
[59:03.600 --> 59:04.440]  Yeah.
[59:04.440 --> 59:06.920]  I like how you have to hold back on that answer.
[59:06.920 --> 59:08.480]  Oh yeah, I have.
[59:08.480 --> 59:11.080]  If you ever really want to know my view on that,
[59:11.080 --> 59:12.320]  come see me at the store.
[59:13.360 --> 59:15.320]  I've talked to several other HydroShop owners
[59:15.320 --> 59:16.880]  and you guys all seem to agree.
[59:16.880 --> 59:19.760]  Everybody feels the same about Sunlight and HydroFarm.
[59:19.760 --> 59:22.240]  Our customers built, I'll say this,
[59:22.240 --> 59:25.080]  our customers built them a hell of a nice fucking living.
[59:26.160 --> 59:27.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[59:27.880 --> 59:29.120]  All right, guys, I feel like it's about time
[59:29.120 --> 59:29.960]  to wrap up the show.
[59:30.720 --> 59:31.920]  We've been on the show for almost an hour here.
[59:31.920 --> 59:33.120]  Jesse, you got anybody to shout out,
[59:33.120 --> 59:36.040]  anybody to say thanks to, anything like that?
[59:36.040 --> 59:37.080]  Burned.
[59:37.080 --> 59:37.920]  Of course.
[59:37.920 --> 59:39.080]  Everyone down at the store.
[59:40.440 --> 59:41.800]  Had a good experience in there today.
[59:41.800 --> 59:42.640]  Sweet, good.
[59:45.080 --> 59:46.320]  Let me think of a strain.
[59:47.840 --> 59:52.360]  I've been digging on some SFEOG lately, big time.
[59:52.360 --> 59:54.640]  So when do I get my cut of that SFEOG?
[59:54.640 --> 59:55.720]  Oh, I thought you already had one.
[59:55.720 --> 59:57.560]  No, no, that's all I had to say, huh?
[59:57.560 --> 59:58.400]  Nice.
[59:58.440 --> 59:59.920]  That's all that I've been told, so.
[59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.360]  I think I know where yours came from
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.080]  and they don't want me to have it.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.160]  They wouldn't give it to me.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.040]  Being a breeder, dude,
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.840]  people don't want you to have their cuts.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.080]  Yeah.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.320]  Yeah, I know.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.560]  That cut of SFE's made a lot of great strains
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.720]  and I think we're gonna make a couple with it too.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.920]  I guarantee we'll make a couple.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.040]  I'll make a couple.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:19.880]  You'll make a couple.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.920]  Yeah.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.440]  All right, guys, we're gonna wrap up the show.

[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.380]  We still need our own theme song
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.560]  if anybody wants to help us out with that.
