[00:57.840 --> 01:01.360]  From Your Heart podcast. Thanks again for joining me. Sitting across the table is White
[01:01.360 --> 01:04.960]  Mike. Welcome back to the show, bro. Thanks, man. Thanks for having me. Oh man. Thanks
[01:04.960 --> 01:09.880]  for taking time out of the busy schedule of two kids. Congratulations. Dos ninos. It's
[01:09.880 --> 01:13.600]  a lot. Dos ninos. Yeah. You can tell where we're from. Welcome. We're doing a show from
[01:13.600 --> 01:18.440]  Pueblo, Colorado where the white guys speak real good Spanish. I was just in an Instagram
[01:18.440 --> 01:22.600]  live feed and somebody tried to throw out some German and I responded in German and
[01:22.600 --> 01:27.320]  the whole room just went silent. The entire chat stopped. I was like, well, I apologize
[01:27.320 --> 01:31.160]  for that. I thought that was funny. Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome
[01:31.160 --> 01:35.360]  Mike's on the show. We're going to do a show about what are we going to talk about determining
[01:35.360 --> 01:39.400]  ripeness and when to harvest your cannabis plants before we get there. You know, I like
[01:39.400 --> 01:44.520]  to start the episodes by stop by talk by stalking about. Yeah, let's let's talk about let's
[01:44.520 --> 01:49.480]  talk about what I've been dabbing. That was hard to say. I've been taking dabs of some
[01:49.480 --> 01:56.400]  Viola Labs Clementine Cookies live resin. I'm opening it up to smell it right now. It
[01:56.480 --> 02:03.360]  is like spicy orange candy and I really love the smell and flavor of this. I picked up
[02:03.360 --> 02:07.320]  three grams today when I went. I usually just get one gram of each flavor. I was like, do
[02:07.320 --> 02:11.640]  they have more of that? They do. I'll just take three and I will be on my way. Mike,
[02:11.640 --> 02:14.600]  is it time to change that microphone cover? Is that what you're subliminally telling me
[02:14.600 --> 02:20.400]  right now? It's got a furry spot, but I've got Malamute, so I'm used to furry spots.
[02:20.400 --> 02:25.400]  We're going to blame that on your Malamutes. It's not Malamute hair, but it's not hippie
[02:25.400 --> 02:28.840]  hair either. So I'm cool just pulling it off and rolling with it. But yeah, we might
[02:28.840 --> 02:32.680]  want to look for a new cover after this show. Welcome to the furry spot podcast. Ladies
[02:32.680 --> 02:35.440]  and gentlemen, it's going to be that kind of show. We're going to put this show back
[02:35.440 --> 02:38.640]  on track. We've got a couple of sponsors we should shout out. Shout out to my friends
[02:38.640 --> 02:42.360]  at the Hella Dank Seed Company. Shout out to water. Shout out to water. You're drinking
[02:42.360 --> 02:46.040]  water now. You guys. Mike is drinking water. This is like a rare occasion. I didn't pack
[02:46.040 --> 02:50.720]  properly for this mission. Then some water is happening. You need some water anyway,
[02:50.720 --> 02:53.680]  Brian. I don't feel bad for you. And then he went spilled half of it right down your
[02:53.680 --> 02:57.720]  face. Mike's drinking water. You guys, that's a rare occasion. Ah, the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:57.720 --> 03:03.360]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company at dankseed.store.

[03:11.680 --> 03:15.240]  all times. Sometimes you're away and you're like, I wonder if that air conditioner clicked
[03:15.240 --> 03:19.520]  on. It's pretty hot outside. I wonder if that air conditioner is working. I wonder. You
[03:19.520 --> 03:22.200]  can't even focus. You can't even think about what you're doing. You're like, ah, is that
[03:22.200 --> 03:25.400]  air conditioner working? You want to drive home and look, but you can't drive home. You're
[03:25.400 --> 03:29.800]  just freaking out. You know what? Bust out your phone. Check out your PL Minder unit.
[03:29.800 --> 03:33.400]  You can see what's going on in your grow room at all times. How do you get a PL Grow? How
[03:33.400 --> 03:37.400]  do you get a PL Minder unit? You go to PL Grow dot systems. That's how. Check them out
[03:37.400 --> 03:42.200]  at PL Grow dot systems. You guys, PL Grow Systems Minder unit will let you know what's
[03:42.200 --> 03:46.200]  going on in your grow room at all times. You can relax. You can enjoy what you're doing.
[03:46.200 --> 03:51.000]  It's awesome. All right, let's move forward. Ah, YouTube. You guys, all of the YouTube
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.080]  videos are caught up. I did it. It took a long time, but they are finally there.
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.920]  That was a multi-year project. YouTube got evil right before completion.
[04:02.920 --> 04:06.600]  Right at the scariest time. Yeah, it was just about caught up and then all of the YouTube
[04:06.600 --> 04:11.640]  channels started disappearing. I don't put videos of myself consuming on this channel.
[04:11.640 --> 04:13.240]  On the roof of my heart channel. That might be your saving grace.
[04:13.240 --> 04:16.760]  So yeah, I talk heavily about it, but they don't see it. So unless they're looking for
[04:16.760 --> 04:21.640]  it and someone reports it, we should be okay. We'll see how long it lasts. Either way, if it
[04:21.640 --> 04:26.920]  does disappear, I'll find a new place to put it. Don't worry. YouTube is a that's just another
[04:26.920 --> 04:30.440]  place for more people to listen to the show. I think we'll probably get more, more listens,
[04:30.440 --> 04:35.400]  more views, more interactions. All right, Mike, you got anything to say before we start talking
[04:35.400 --> 04:41.320]  about determining ripeness on cannabis plants? You got any topics you want to bring before we
[04:41.320 --> 04:46.200]  get on a ramble here? Not yet. We'll just see where it takes us. Mike says, we'll see where
[04:46.200 --> 04:51.240]  this takes us. All right. So a lot of people were talking on Instagram live and on chat rooms right
[04:51.240 --> 04:58.520]  now about how to decide when to harvest their cannabis. When is my cannabis ripe? The seed
[04:58.520 --> 05:02.920]  packs are going to tell you a certain timeframe. They're going to say 56 to 63 days. They're going
[05:02.920 --> 05:09.880]  to say 63 to 70 days. They're going to say nine to 10 weeks. The first time you run that pack of seeds,
[05:10.440 --> 05:15.480]  I would say go the longest timeframe that they give you as an option. At least plan for it,
[05:15.480 --> 05:21.480]  for sure. Yes. Yeah. If it says 10 weeks, nine to 10 weeks, go the 10 weeks because maybe in that
[05:21.480 --> 05:26.040]  last week, that's when you're going to see extra trichomes pack on. You're going to see the extra
[05:26.040 --> 05:32.040]  weight come on. You're going to see maybe some cool colors. You may see some shit you don't see
[05:32.040 --> 05:37.320]  if you cut it down at week nine. So let it go 10 weeks if it says 10 weeks. If it says 56 to 63
[05:37.400 --> 05:45.560]  days, let it go 63. Let it go 65 if it looks okay and see what happens. So that being said,
[05:45.560 --> 05:53.800]  the way to determine ripeness of your cannabis plants is not by looking at the hairs. It is not
[05:53.800 --> 05:59.640]  by looking at the shape of the buds. It's not by looking at, I did air quotes when I said-
[06:00.120 --> 06:04.440]  I'm just, I'm hearing different people throughout my cannabis career,
[06:06.760 --> 06:13.800]  like speaking at length about how all of those are telltale signs of like either perfect herb or
[06:13.800 --> 06:20.440]  good herb or completed herb, ready to harvest herb. It's all nonsense. Yeah. What we are growing
[06:20.440 --> 06:26.120]  cannabis for, the viable part that we want are the trichomes. Why would we look at anything but
[06:26.200 --> 06:30.840]  the trichomes, right? We want to harvest those when they're at their ripest point. So we should
[06:30.840 --> 06:36.280]  be paying attention to the trichomes. The only way you can do that, you can, if somebody tells
[06:36.280 --> 06:41.960]  you they can see the trichomes with their naked eye, either steal their eyes or kick them in the
[06:41.960 --> 06:47.160]  dick because they're a liar. You cannot see amber trichomes without some sort of magnification. You
[06:47.160 --> 06:54.360]  need at least 60X, maybe 100X magnification to see if a trichome is clear, cloudy, silver,
[06:54.360 --> 07:00.280]  milky, amber, busted, ruptured. If the head's broken off of it, you need magnification. You
[07:00.280 --> 07:04.680]  cannot see that with the naked eye. And if you can, you're fucking awesome. Send me a message.
[07:04.680 --> 07:11.160]  I want to hear about it. Yep. Good. Get on Amazon. Start looking at scopes, folks. Yeah. Get yourself
[07:11.160 --> 07:16.200]  like a jeweler's loop. I have a scope from Dynolite that hooks up to my computer. I plug it
[07:16.200 --> 07:22.280]  right into the USB slot. It took me just a few minutes to mess with the drivers to make it link
[07:22.280 --> 07:27.480]  up to my computer. Once it linked up, it was no problem ever. I open up the application. I'm able
[07:27.480 --> 07:33.880]  to run the scope over the plants and I can focus it in and I can see those trichomes very large on
[07:33.880 --> 07:38.680]  my computer screen and it makes it very, and I can take pictures. So if I can't tell exactly what I'm
[07:38.680 --> 07:43.800]  looking at, I can reach over and I think I press F11 and I take a photo right there. Boom. Then I
[07:43.800 --> 07:48.440]  can go look later and I can see if that plant's ripe or not. The computerized scope makes life a
[07:48.440 --> 07:53.560]  lot easier, but you can pick up something kind of like a jeweler's loop. That's a lot less expensive
[07:53.560 --> 07:58.600]  and just as functional. The 420 scope will work for you. Just a basic jeweler's loop will work
[07:58.600 --> 08:03.720]  for you. There's one that Hydrofarm sells. It spreads in half. It's got batteries in it and
[08:03.720 --> 08:07.320]  then it splits in half and the batteries are in one side and the optics are actually on the other
[08:07.320 --> 08:13.560]  side. They make a 60 and a 100 X. I would recommend the 100 X if you go for that. That's probably the
[08:13.560 --> 08:17.400]  best one on the market. If you're going to get something like that, that I'm aware of, there's
[08:17.400 --> 08:22.840]  probably something better by now. But get some magnification. Magnification will help you out in
[08:22.840 --> 08:27.320]  so many ways. You'll be able to tell if your trichomes are clear, if they're silver, if they're
[08:27.320 --> 08:31.880]  cloudy, if they're milky, if they're amber, if they're ruptured. Also, you'll be able to identify
[08:31.880 --> 08:36.680]  the pests and the funguses and the problems on the undersides of your leaves more accurately if
[08:36.680 --> 08:41.560]  you've got a scope to look at those things. It's a really useful tool throughout the growth cycle
[08:41.560 --> 08:46.280]  for sure. Yeah, once you've got all of your tools dialed in and you've got some money to spend on a
[08:46.280 --> 08:51.160]  couple of extra toys for the grow room, get yourself a scope. It will really help. A scope or a loop
[08:51.160 --> 08:57.080]  or something that hooks up to your computer. All right, so the hairs are not going to tell you how
[08:57.080 --> 09:01.160]  ready your plant is. Mike just tapped his headphones. Are you too hot there? No, I just got an itch.
[09:01.160 --> 09:05.160]  All right, scratch it up, buddy. Good boy. Good boy. His leg's starting to go because he's scratching
[09:05.160 --> 09:11.800]  behind his ear, you guys. A little twitching. All right. The only thing that's going to tell you if
[09:11.800 --> 09:15.480]  your cannabis plants are ripe are the trichomes. We're growing for trichomes. That's what we want.
[09:15.480 --> 09:18.760]  If you're growing to make quality flowers, if you're going to make edibles, if you're going to
[09:18.760 --> 09:22.680]  make extracts, if you're going to make anything, the trichomes are what matter. So pay attention to
[09:22.680 --> 09:29.080]  that. Nothing else. Now the way that you could tell the trichomes, you're going to see the trichomes
[09:29.080 --> 09:33.400]  develop on your plant. If you have a scope and you can pay attention through the entire process,
[09:33.400 --> 09:38.600]  do that. Watch those trichomes go from a little bitty stalk. Watch them develop ahead. Watch the
[09:38.600 --> 09:44.600]  head of that trichome fill up. You'll watch it fill up. It'll get juicy. And then it'll start
[09:44.600 --> 09:50.920]  to change colors. It'll go from clear. Then it'll slowly turn to like a silverish color. Then it'll
[09:50.920 --> 09:55.400]  get cloudy. You'll be, once you see it, you'll know. Right now you're going, what does he mean
[09:55.400 --> 10:00.840]  by cloudy? You've got to imagine if you've got a fishbowl and then you put some dish soap in there
[10:00.840 --> 10:05.400]  and stir it up. It's cloudy. That's what your cloudy trichomes are going to look like. That's
[10:05.400 --> 10:12.200]  cloudy. Now your next step after cloudy is milky. Sometimes they turn kind of bluish, in my opinion.
[10:12.200 --> 10:17.880]  They have a hint of blue. They have that. If you stare at like certain white paints and whatnot,
[10:17.880 --> 10:22.760]  you'll start to see a blue kind of undertone a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a nice
[10:23.320 --> 10:27.560]  patch of milky trichomes. I always see just a little hint of light blue in there.
[10:27.560 --> 10:31.800]  So the fishbowl I talked about a minute ago, imagine if I took your fishbowl that had,
[10:31.800 --> 10:35.160]  we dumped out the dish soap because this is just going to get gross if we keep adding stuff. I'm
[10:35.160 --> 10:39.640]  gross. Let's do this differently. Imagine if you took a fishbowl that's got water in it and you
[10:39.640 --> 10:45.960]  poured just enough milk in there to make it turn light white, light white. Not it's not going to be
[10:45.960 --> 10:50.200]  fucking boom like ice cream, but it's going to be light white. Like you poured some creamer in
[10:50.200 --> 10:54.440]  your coffee. You just lighten it up. You can see it now. Now that trichome is what I would call
[10:54.440 --> 11:00.840]  milky. That is a milky trichome. You're almost ready for harvest. The next step that's going to
[11:00.840 --> 11:05.560]  happen is going to look like you had a spray bottle. Imagine if I took like the little spray
[11:05.560 --> 11:09.880]  bottle that you're spraying your plants with or whatever that little mister bottle. What if I
[11:09.880 --> 11:16.200]  poured some Dr. Pepper in there and I walked right up to your trichomes and just just give it a little
[11:16.200 --> 11:23.000]  spritz of Dr. Pepper. Your trichomes are going to have a little amber spritz on them now. And that's
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.080]  exactly what I think it looks like. It's like you sprayed some soda right onto your trichomes.
[11:28.600 --> 11:32.280]  They're going to go from milky and then you're going to see just a couple of them get this
[11:32.840 --> 11:37.720]  amber color, this Dr. Pepper color right across them. And you're going to see it happen toward
[11:37.720 --> 11:42.120]  the top and kind of right in the middle. And then keep paying attention to the whole plank. It's
[11:42.120 --> 11:47.400]  going to move around. But when you see that first bit of amber really start paying attention, because
[11:47.400 --> 11:51.800]  you've got a very short time now, they're going to start that amber is going to start progressing
[11:51.800 --> 11:58.440]  throughout the plant really quickly. And when you look at the scope and you can see, you're
[11:58.440 --> 12:03.480]  going to have to look around the plant when 30% of those trichomes start becoming amber. That's
[12:03.480 --> 12:10.520]  when you want to cut down 30%. Now, I say look in several places, you're going to be like 30%. How
[12:10.520 --> 12:15.000]  do I know when I can see 100 trichomes in there? Just look around and use your best judgment you
[12:15.000 --> 12:22.120]  guys about 25 to 35% is where you want to aim for. You're not going to notice a difference if you're
[12:22.120 --> 12:26.760]  a few days off on your harvest. Honestly, you are not going to notice a huge difference. You've got
[12:26.760 --> 12:32.280]  a dry and cure period. Once you cut down these plants, those trichomes are going to continue to
[12:32.280 --> 12:36.840]  change all the way until the moment you combust them. You're going to cut them down, you've got
[12:36.840 --> 12:41.640]  this dry period, they're going to get beat up in harvest, they're going to get cured, they're going
[12:41.640 --> 12:46.360]  to change, there's going to be so many different changes in those trichomes. So just a couple of
[12:46.360 --> 12:50.680]  days in your harvest window will not make a huge difference. You're not going to notice it, it's
[12:50.680 --> 12:56.520]  not going to hurt your feelings. So pay attention to those trichomes, get yourself a scope, they're
[12:56.520 --> 13:01.000]  going to go clear, then they're going to turn silver, then they're going to get cloudy. That's
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  when it starts getting exciting, they're filling up with trichomes or with cannabinoids now,
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.520]  they've got different things in there, different psychoactive ingredients inside of there that are
[13:10.520 --> 13:14.920]  changing every day. Then they're going to get milky, they're going to turn a little bit blue,
[13:15.480 --> 13:20.360]  then they're going to look like I sprayed them with Dr. Pepper. When three out of 10, when 30%
[13:20.440 --> 13:27.720]  of them have that Dr. Pepper stain on them, that's when it's time to cut. So you're going to say,
[13:27.720 --> 13:34.280]  but it's my first grow with this plant. How do I plan that? How do I properly be able to flush
[13:34.280 --> 13:40.440]  and look out for trichomes to be amber? I thought of a great way that we can all be safe. Keep in
[13:40.440 --> 13:45.480]  mind, this isn't going to be the last time you're growing the strain, hopefully. This is the first
[13:45.480 --> 13:48.600]  time you grew it. That's why you don't know when the trichomes are going to change colors. That's
[13:48.600 --> 13:52.040]  why you don't know how long it's going to take. It's the first time you're developing a relationship
[13:52.040 --> 13:56.360]  with this plant. The first time you got to learn it. The second, third time you dial it in. The
[13:56.360 --> 14:01.560]  fourth and fifth time you fucking perfect this grow. So you're just learning this one. So keep
[14:01.560 --> 14:07.560]  thinking about it this way. If you're growing a 60 day plant, if the package says, grow it for
[14:07.560 --> 14:13.880]  55 to 60 days, go that 60 days. If you're going to go for 60 days, flush it day 50 and really start
[14:13.880 --> 14:18.120]  paying attention to those trichomes. If you want to cut it down at a specific day, just make sure
[14:18.200 --> 14:24.360]  you flushed seven to 10 days pretty heavily. I'd like to go 14, but seven to 10 days should be
[14:24.360 --> 14:30.360]  plenty. If you want to let your plant go 70 days, if you've got something I bred, you probably want
[14:30.360 --> 14:36.440]  to let it go 70 days. If I bred it 70 days, no problem. Start flushing it day 60 and pay attention
[14:36.440 --> 14:40.920]  to your trichomes. You can cut down at day 70. If you don't feel like it's ready, let it go a little
[14:40.920 --> 14:44.840]  bit longer. It doesn't need nutrients to keep going. It's just going to start getting tired,
[14:44.840 --> 14:51.320]  but then you can give it time to ripen up. So I think the way to judge when to harvest your
[14:51.320 --> 14:56.920]  cannabis is by paying attention to the trichomes. If you don't have a way to look at the trichomes,
[14:56.920 --> 15:01.560]  you don't have a way to accurately judge the ripeness of your cannabis plants and you run
[15:01.560 --> 15:06.440]  the risk of cutting them way too early is what most people do. If you feel like they're done,
[15:06.440 --> 15:11.000]  wait three to five more days. If you can wait seven more days, wait because they're only going
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.640]  to get better and don't cut too early because you're anxious and eager. Patience. You cut
[15:17.640 --> 15:22.280]  clones or you grew from seeds and those took time. Then you veged it out and you spent a lot of money
[15:22.280 --> 15:28.760]  on nutrients you've already spent. You're probably going to put 115 days into it. Why not put 122?
[15:28.760 --> 15:33.320]  What's another week? I know you start getting itchy. You start getting that crack head lips
[15:33.320 --> 15:36.600]  and you start scratching your neck. You're like, yeah, I want to cut it down. I'm thinking of a
[15:36.600 --> 15:40.920]  friend of mine who was always in that clip in lower nut. You'd start at the bottom of the plant
[15:40.920 --> 15:47.160]  and start taking nugs and drying them out as fast as he could to keep himself covered. By the time
[15:47.160 --> 15:52.360]  he got the harvest, it was just like the top coal is left on the plan. Yeah. And then there's nothing
[15:52.360 --> 15:57.240]  to enjoy because you fast ride everything. And you could have just had one huge harvest and
[15:57.240 --> 16:01.880]  actually saw a harvest and see, you could see what it looks like, what your work actually did
[16:01.880 --> 16:06.040]  instead of just destroying your work slowly and not getting any reward. Yeah. So be patient,
[16:06.040 --> 16:10.200]  you guys. That's, that's one of the main things that it's hard to learn when you're growing
[16:10.200 --> 16:14.120]  cannabis. Sometimes you just need to hide your scissors, send Mike home with the scissors,
[16:14.120 --> 16:17.960]  be like, bro, take these so that I can't cut my plants up. You're like, oh, you're on suicide
[16:17.960 --> 16:24.040]  watch or something. Take these bros. I can't fuck up. So, uh, I guess that was a pretty quick way
[16:24.040 --> 16:28.360]  to do it, but I mean, that's right to the point. There's no other way to explain that. Uh, get a
[16:28.360 --> 16:32.920]  jeweler's loop, get some sort of magnification and look at your trichomes. I know I keep saying
[16:32.920 --> 16:38.280]  it. We're growing for trichomes. We don't care about all that. You just got to get in there with
[16:38.280 --> 16:43.160]  some magnification and spend some time reading the plan. Yeah. We don't, we're not worried about all
[16:43.160 --> 16:46.920]  the green leafy part. I mean, that part tastes good. That's fun to smoke. That's a cool carrier,
[16:46.920 --> 16:51.080]  but the trichomes are the goal. So make sure they're ripe. Um, something that I should add,
[16:51.640 --> 16:58.440]  if you are growing for concentrates, uh, maybe cut a little bit early, start flushing early and
[16:58.440 --> 17:03.320]  harvest a little bit early because once the, if you want nice and clear concentrates, maybe this
[17:03.320 --> 17:06.760]  is some industry secrets secrets I shouldn't be sharing with the general public, but here you go,
[17:06.760 --> 17:11.080]  guys. I love you. And this is free. Uh, if you want nice and clear concentrates, cut your plants
[17:11.080 --> 17:17.240]  down before the trichomes start getting dark. If they start getting dark, what you're extracting
[17:17.320 --> 17:21.960]  is trichomes. Your concentrates will come out a little bit darker, cut them down when they're
[17:21.960 --> 17:26.120]  nice and clear. And guess what? Nice and clear concentrates. It's easier. A lot of, a lot of
[17:26.120 --> 17:30.680]  concentrate makers can make super clear concentrates out of everything now, but it's easier. It's less
[17:30.680 --> 17:35.560]  to clean up. It's less work. If you're pulling it down when you have got nice and clear trichomes
[17:35.560 --> 17:39.400]  early in process quickly. Yep. They cut them down. I don't even want to tell you what week,
[17:39.400 --> 17:44.520]  sometimes like week seven ish. I've seen it go for concentrates. Yeah. A little bit ridiculous,
[17:44.520 --> 17:48.440]  but then you can pull a whole one more harvest a year. If you cut everything down at the end of
[17:48.440 --> 17:53.880]  week six, that you could fit one more harvest a year in your schedule. That's business.
[17:53.880 --> 17:58.680]  Unfortunately, you guys do not do that. Be patient. Let it go long enough. Let it be done.
[17:58.680 --> 18:06.280]  Like Axel Rose said, all we need is just a little patience. Mike just gave me the funniest look.
[18:06.280 --> 18:09.640]  All right, you guys. Hey Mike, do you got any political stuff you want to talk about for a
[18:09.640 --> 18:22.520]  minute? Some, there's always some. Good news this week for medical cannabis consumers or patients,
[18:22.520 --> 18:29.880]  whichever you prefer down in Florida. A judge down there ruled that they can finally consume their
[18:29.880 --> 18:35.880]  cannabis products by combustion and inhalation. They made smoking marijuana legal finally for
[18:35.880 --> 18:40.440]  medical patients down there. Up until recently, they were sort of insisting that people use
[18:41.800 --> 18:48.520]  non-smokable or vapable forms. So they were only able to use tinctures, topicals, capsules.
[18:48.520 --> 18:53.480]  And edibles. And edibles. Well, that's okay. Edibles, oils, tinctures. All right. I mean,
[18:53.480 --> 18:58.920]  it's quite a variety of products and Florida's really just getting off the ground. But...
[18:58.920 --> 19:05.480]  Can they dab concentrates now? I'm actually, this literally just happened this morning.
[19:06.200 --> 19:09.480]  But they can at least smoke a bowl now. They can smoke a joint, which is why a lot of us
[19:09.480 --> 19:14.840]  choose cannabis because that's how it's immediately effective. You can get an immediate effect and you
[19:14.840 --> 19:20.840]  can titrate your dose perfectly. Perfectly. Like the first time out the door, no. But by the time
[19:20.840 --> 19:26.520]  you're successfully treating a pain disorder or something like that, I can consume exactly to the
[19:26.520 --> 19:32.120]  point of no pain. Right. And then if I choose to consume further into the points of enjoyment,
[19:32.120 --> 19:36.920]  I can choose to do that or stop. I know about where my medical needs are. I know about how many
[19:36.920 --> 19:40.840]  dabs it takes for me to meet my medical requirements. And then I know about when I
[19:40.840 --> 19:45.400]  start going recreational. I know where that line is. And then I know how to sustain that medical.
[19:45.400 --> 19:49.080]  And then I also know how to cross that line whenever I need to. So yeah, we should be
[19:49.080 --> 19:53.320]  allowed to... Well, I'm glad that Florida is allowed to consume properly now. For a while,
[19:53.320 --> 19:58.760]  there was just a federal patient or two down there that could smoke. Everybody else had to eat. But
[19:58.760 --> 20:02.440]  now it's everybody. Was that our buddy? That's our buddy, Irv. That was our buddy, Irv. Shout
[20:02.440 --> 20:07.560]  out to Irv. If y'all don't know who Irv Rosenfeld is, hop on YouTube and prepare to have your mind
[20:07.560 --> 20:13.320]  fucking blown away. Yeah. This guy can smoke whenever, wherever. Let's just say, when you
[20:13.320 --> 20:18.440]  think of the world record holder for most joints consumed per lifetime, you don't think of a Jewish
[20:18.440 --> 20:24.760]  stockbroker in Florida. But you should. Speaking of a lot of joints smoked, happy birthday to Tommy
[20:24.840 --> 20:30.760]  Chong. Happy birthday, Tommy. I think he's 80 this weekend. Yes, Dave's old as fuck, bro.
[20:31.560 --> 20:36.280]  He's not here, man. So shout out to our friends down there in Florida, finally able to do it
[20:36.280 --> 20:41.960]  right. Welcome to the club, Florida. How many of those retired folk down there in Florida are the
[20:41.960 --> 20:46.440]  cannabis consumers? Is that part of who's consuming, do you think? Oh, for sure. For sure.
[20:47.240 --> 20:53.640]  One of the fun little data points out of Colorado is our medical program. The average age is 42.
[20:53.960 --> 20:59.880]  And that was when you and me were in our twenties and early thirties in it. And it was still well
[20:59.880 --> 21:03.640]  into the forties. And that's because boomers are a huge cannabis consuming population.
[21:05.080 --> 21:11.080]  It's a population with a lot of aches and pains. And if they can treat those in a way that doesn't
[21:11.080 --> 21:17.320]  zonk them out and they can enjoy those years substantially more because they choose to use
[21:17.320 --> 21:21.400]  cannabis instead of opioids for their pain or trying to choose with just dealing with their
[21:21.400 --> 21:25.560]  pain. Like they dive right on it, the topicals, the edibles, they love it all.
[21:26.200 --> 21:33.960]  I think it's a great social lubricant and a great alternative to alcohol. I cannot manage alcohol.
[21:33.960 --> 21:39.080]  And so once I start drinking, we're just going to drink and it's not going to be a pretty ending.
[21:39.080 --> 21:44.200]  Like that's just how my alcohol consumption goes. I cannot do to myself with dabs and cannabis what
[21:44.200 --> 21:48.920]  I'm able to do to myself with alcohol. So I think just a couple of, you know, you just
[21:49.480 --> 21:53.320]  smoke with people. You just pass around a pipe. It creates that. When you pass around a pipe
[21:53.320 --> 21:57.480]  together, you just created friendship, you know, Hey, I hit this, you hit this. We both consume
[21:57.480 --> 22:02.040]  the same thing. Let's be friends now. I think it's just becoming more of an acceptable social
[22:02.040 --> 22:08.280]  lubricant as well. It's not so taboo. Uh, more people are willing to admit that they consume
[22:08.280 --> 22:13.320]  cannabis, which is kind of nice. A lot of people used to only smoke behind closed doors. It's fun
[22:13.400 --> 22:20.440]  watching everybody come out of the woodwork for sure. It's a, it was lonely for a while in the
[22:20.440 --> 22:26.120]  nineties. Like I remember times where it was like you changed location and you'd spend months like
[22:27.080 --> 22:32.440]  meeting new people and then figuring out like who you should ask about cannabis and how you should
[22:32.440 --> 22:39.080]  ask it. I mean, there was a time before, Hey bro, do you smoke? And then the reply of a smoke was
[22:39.560 --> 22:46.600]  bro. Like that wasn't always a thing. You used to have to be like, Hey, I noticed that you have a
[22:46.600 --> 22:52.120]  Jeep Cherokee with a fish sticker on it. Yeah. I walked in with fucking long ass hair and a grateful
[22:52.120 --> 22:58.440]  dead shirt and everyone's like, Hey bro, can I buy drugs? Jane too. Um, want to go ski Mary Jane
[22:58.440 --> 23:04.600]  together after class later? Like it used to be fucking complicated. Yeah. And now everybody's
[23:04.600 --> 23:07.880]  coming out of the woodwork. It's one of the things I really liked about being a bud tender
[23:08.440 --> 23:16.360]  is all walks of life coming in, just having a blast, um, sharing a love of cannabis. Like
[23:16.360 --> 23:23.160]  not one customer, um, after another would match up in any way, shape or form. It's not like working
[23:23.160 --> 23:28.520]  in any other retail where it's you, you're at the hot clothing store. So it's all like 18, 19 and
[23:28.520 --> 23:34.280]  21 years coming in or you sell hiking shoes. So it's all 35 and 45 year old guys that come in.
[23:34.280 --> 23:39.320]  Like when you're working at the bud counter, anyone of any age and any demographic can walk
[23:39.320 --> 23:45.480]  in. Like we'd have people from different countries just regularly coming to check out what we're
[23:45.480 --> 23:50.680]  doing. Anybody 21 or not. Yeah. 21 and up. But still, but still that's just about every walk
[23:50.680 --> 23:56.120]  of life is able to walk in there. You got dudes that work in the industry, construction guys,
[23:56.120 --> 24:03.320]  business guys, doctors, lawyers, firemen, uh, law enforcement, uh, accountants, car salesmen,
[24:03.320 --> 24:07.800]  everybody was coming in there. I mean, you'll have a $200,000 car next to a VW bus in the
[24:07.800 --> 24:12.920]  parking lot and it makes for a good photo for Facebook. But other than that, it's just your
[24:12.920 --> 24:18.120]  regular work day. You know what I find is the guy that drives the Volkswagen bus buys the more
[24:18.120 --> 24:23.960]  expensive product than the guy that buys that drives the, the, uh, the Beamer or whatever the
[24:23.960 --> 24:32.600]  other example was the Mercedes. Yep. They, uh, the, the more you're into the cannabis community
[24:32.600 --> 24:37.880]  and lifestyle, the more you care about quality. I think, yes, you get a lot of people that are
[24:37.880 --> 24:42.600]  like, it all smells the same to me and you just want to smack them. But like, Oh, especially
[24:43.560 --> 24:48.440]  grew it and bread it. Like it all smells the fucking same. What? Um, I get the same with
[24:48.440 --> 24:54.440]  like seafood. I know people that love seafood and there's big intricacies between like this
[24:54.440 --> 24:58.120]  particular product and that particular, but it all fucking smells like death to me. I can't get
[24:58.120 --> 25:02.600]  anywhere near it. Um, and so like, I get it. Some people just don't have the palette to,
[25:02.600 --> 25:08.200]  to distinguish cannabis varieties, but man, for those of us that can, it's a wonderful world.
[25:08.200 --> 25:12.040]  And the more you get into the world, the more you care about quality, the more you're willing
[25:12.040 --> 25:16.280]  to dig into it. And a lot of people are like, I don't care. Give me the strongest. Yeah. I went
[25:16.280 --> 25:20.520]  to a dispensary, a new place the other day that I'd never shopped in before. Uh, just because
[25:20.520 --> 25:23.960]  I went to weed maps and they said they had a product I wanted. And so I already knew what
[25:23.960 --> 25:27.400]  I was shopping for the minute I walked in and I walk in and they're like, Hey, welcome to this
[25:27.400 --> 25:30.760]  place. Have you ever been here? And I was like, Nope. And they're like, let us give you a tour.
[25:30.760 --> 25:35.000]  And I said, honestly, I'm just here for this, uh, the green dot star dog, the black label,
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.760]  green dot black label, star dog concentrate. And they're like, Oh, well let me show you around.
[25:38.760 --> 25:42.760]  And I was like, no, I'm here for the green dot star label, star dog, black label. And she's
[25:42.760 --> 25:47.400]  like, well, here are the concentrates. Here's our clothing. And I was like, no, I want, and I was
[25:47.400 --> 25:51.880]  like, just get it. Yeah. It took me so many tries just to convince this lady. I know what I want.
[25:51.880 --> 25:55.080]  And then when she showed it to me, she goes, well, this is, and she told me how much it was a
[25:55.080 --> 25:58.680]  little pricey. I don't know if I should say how much stuff costs on the air, but she said a number
[25:58.680 --> 26:02.200]  and I was like, Oh, that's, that's not, you know, that's not cheap. But I was like, yeah, I want
[26:02.200 --> 26:06.040]  that one. And I want one of these also. And she's like, those are this much. And I was like, yeah,
[26:06.040 --> 26:11.960]  I want it. And she acted like, Oh, okay. And then is this a place on the South side of town? Yeah.
[26:11.960 --> 26:18.360]  I told you where I went. Yeah. Typical. I mean, he, my guess is that part of town, they get a
[26:18.360 --> 26:21.720]  clientele looking for a different price point. Right. Yeah. And so they were kind of shocked
[26:21.720 --> 26:25.240]  when I asked for that top shelf stuff, but they wouldn't just walk me. I was like, I want high end
[26:25.240 --> 26:30.600]  concentrate. Then she wouldn't just show me that. And then they do this weird thing. Um, most
[26:30.600 --> 26:34.680]  dispensaries you say, yeah, I'll take that thing. Right. And then either that bud tender walks it
[26:34.680 --> 26:38.360]  to the cash register and rings you up for it and takes your money and tells you have a great day
[26:38.360 --> 26:43.480]  and high fives you. Right. They go, okay. And they push some buttons on an iPad and she just kind of
[26:43.480 --> 26:47.320]  walked away from me. And I was like, well, no, what the fuck. And she came back. She goes, Oh,
[26:47.320 --> 26:50.600]  they'll call your name when they're ready for you, sweetie. Walk around and look around. And I was
[26:50.600 --> 26:53.880]  like, well, okay. And so I just walk around for a couple of minutes aimlessly because I don't
[26:53.880 --> 26:57.240]  really want to see anything I've already purchased. I've already selected. Why do I want to go walk
[26:57.240 --> 27:02.040]  around now? Yeah. I take money. Let me go home. It'd be somewhere comfortable to play with my
[27:02.040 --> 27:06.600]  phone at this point. They took a few minutes and then they called my full name over the counter,
[27:06.600 --> 27:11.880]  over the PA, which I don't know if that was cool. Like, isn't there should be some discretion here.
[27:11.880 --> 27:16.200]  Like, I don't understand. It annoyed me as well. Yeah. Like people call me something different
[27:16.200 --> 27:20.760]  here. So I was like, Ooh, I'm going to walk over and be that name. And so then they, uh, they take
[27:20.760 --> 27:25.240]  your money and they show you exactly what you bought one star dog live resin. And they put it
[27:25.240 --> 27:29.800]  in the bag, all smooth. Uh, one was what else did I buy? I got a headband from somebody else that
[27:29.800 --> 27:32.840]  I've never tried. And it was pretty good to another brand. I'd never tried. They got the
[27:32.840 --> 27:35.960]  headband and they put it in there and then they charged me my money. And the guy like tried to
[27:35.960 --> 27:40.280]  give me some speech about how don't transfer this to anybody else and all this stuff. And I was like,
[27:40.280 --> 27:45.000]  yes, sir. I took way too long, but my point was I just wanted to get in there and get that high
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.480]  and concentrate. I mean, they wanted to give me a fucking tour. I had to like break the tour. I was
[27:49.480 --> 27:55.160]  like, no tour for me. It was so frustrating. Just give me the concentrates. It's read your customer
[27:55.160 --> 28:01.400]  better. Yeah. Right. Like there's a person who wants the tour. There's a person who's, who is
[28:01.400 --> 28:04.680]  excited to wander around your store after they've picked out what they're wanting. They're waiting
[28:04.680 --> 28:09.240]  to be charged for it. Oh, they're a recreational store, but I still show them my medical marijuana
[28:09.240 --> 28:13.560]  card because a lot of places will give you a discount. And they did. I went to a place today
[28:13.560 --> 28:17.800]  and they had a long line and they're a medical and recreational facility. And they actually
[28:17.800 --> 28:21.800]  offered to let me skip the line because I'm a medical patient. They're like, do you want to,
[28:21.800 --> 28:25.160]  they go, you can go first if you want, cause you're a med patient. I was like, no, no,
[28:25.160 --> 28:31.080]  I'll wait in line. I'm not, I'm not today. I don't, I'm not an, no, there's some med patients
[28:31.080 --> 28:35.240]  where there's a lot of med patients where you need to, it's awesome that they do that for,
[28:35.240 --> 28:38.920]  right. Like, yeah, no, I'm not. Yeah. I got, I got body pain. I'm not like
[28:39.880 --> 28:45.240]  right. Badly off, bad off or anything. Yeah. I'm not missing time with like my family that I'm not
[28:45.240 --> 28:49.720]  going to get back right now. Cause I'm in a line. Right. Yeah. And I'm, I've got three grams of
[28:49.720 --> 28:53.800]  deliciousness for a good price. So I'm glad I waited, waited my turn and patiently got to check
[28:53.800 --> 29:01.160]  out the bedroom. It's a, there's a, is the cannabis industry kind of expands and contracts.
[29:01.160 --> 29:08.360]  People try different sticks and like the iPad or the Apple store model frustrates the fuck out of
[29:08.360 --> 29:13.640]  me. It feels weird. Like, let me smell these three jars and I'll buy someone. I want to roll
[29:13.640 --> 29:18.520]  like out. It doesn't need to take all afternoon. I've got other shit to do. I've got three more
[29:18.520 --> 29:21.400]  stops to make before I go home. And when I get home, there's going to be screaming kids. Like,
[29:21.400 --> 29:25.800]  I don't have time for your speech. That's why there's so many though. Yeah. And that leads me
[29:25.800 --> 29:28.840]  to something else that I should have been saying on the podcast that I haven't ever said before.
[29:28.840 --> 29:35.160]  You guys, if you're going to a dispensary and the quality is okay, go to a different one next week
[29:35.160 --> 29:38.920]  and see if the quality is awesome because there are dispensaries with better quality than where
[29:38.920 --> 29:44.120]  you're shopping. You don't have to go somewhere just because it's the one on the way home. If you
[29:44.120 --> 29:50.280]  go to the dispensaries with the quality products, the one, the dispensary without quality products
[29:50.280 --> 29:55.480]  will either disappear or they'll step up their game. And then we won't have this problem of all
[29:55.480 --> 30:02.360]  this mediocre fucking weed on the market demand quality. You talk with your money, demand quality,
[30:03.320 --> 30:07.480]  don't feel bad about saying no. Thank you. And leaving without a purchase either. I,
[30:07.480 --> 30:13.480]  people get to the, and decide they didn't want anything. And as a bunch of her, I don't give a
[30:13.480 --> 30:17.560]  fuck. Yeah. Like, I'm sorry. We don't have anything you're interested in. Both of us had
[30:17.560 --> 30:22.040]  our time wasted. Haven't I stay. There's no reason for you to be like, what's the cheapest thing in
[30:22.040 --> 30:25.800]  the store. Yeah. I need to spend eight bucks just because you spent six minutes with me.
[30:25.800 --> 30:31.160]  Sell me this pack of papers. I'll take a pack of papers. Like just no good. You're going to a
[30:31.160 --> 30:35.720]  different weird store. They have papers to go to another place. Go look around feelings. There are
[30:35.720 --> 30:40.040]  a lot of different vibes. There are a lot of different processes, the way that things are
[30:40.040 --> 30:44.920]  handled. If you want to select your product selection, it varies wildly. So wildly pricing
[30:44.920 --> 30:49.960]  will be, you'll see the same products on the shelf for 20 that you'll see for 45 on another place,
[30:49.960 --> 30:56.200]  but then they'll have the rivaling product. The prices will be switched. Like Viola is 20 at one
[30:56.200 --> 31:02.040]  place and CSC is 40 at that place. And then if I drive across town, the Viola is 40 and the CSC is
[31:02.040 --> 31:06.760]  20. And it's just fucking how they priced them. For some reason, there's places in town that only
[31:06.760 --> 31:12.520]  carry one concentrate line. And then the concentrate line they carry, you can't get in any of the shop.
[31:12.520 --> 31:17.480]  Right. There's a lot of that. And it takes kind of going around to all the different shops
[31:17.480 --> 31:22.200]  occasionally to kind of figure out who's got what, when I go to different stores on different days of
[31:22.200 --> 31:27.720]  the week, because there's a store down South that on Tuesday does Terpy Tuesday and these Violas are
[31:27.720 --> 31:33.160]  on sale. And then there's a store up North that does a sale that I like. And then there's another
[31:33.160 --> 31:37.800]  store right down the street from them that I try to time up their two sales. Yeah. Just try to pay
[31:37.800 --> 31:42.760]  attention, go to those sale days. But you guys, like Mike said, you can leave a dispensary without
[31:42.760 --> 31:48.280]  buying anything. This is your medicine that you are buying for maybe you're shopping for the day.
[31:48.280 --> 31:52.440]  Maybe you're shopping for three days. I usually shop for four or five days at a time when I go in,
[31:52.440 --> 31:57.160]  I want to get my medicine for the next three to five days so that I don't have to drive back and
[31:57.160 --> 32:02.200]  wait in line. And if I'm driving up to Colorado Springs, that's a 45 minute drive each direction.
[32:02.200 --> 32:06.920]  Plus I stopped for food. Mike's been hostage in my car for that 45 minute drive up there,
[32:06.920 --> 32:12.040]  20 or 30 minutes in the dispensary. And then another hour getting food plus a piece of
[32:12.040 --> 32:16.360]  drive back 45 minute drive back. And then I want him to come hang out and take dabs after Mike is
[32:16.360 --> 32:21.400]  a hostage for that whole thing. So if I can conflict nine hours, yeah, but it's a fucking
[32:21.400 --> 32:26.360]  awesome nine hours. If I can make that happen less frequently, that saves us time and gas money. So
[32:26.360 --> 32:32.200]  yeah. But my point is don't feel obligated to any dispensary. If you're, if they're not, it's,
[32:32.200 --> 32:35.800]  it's like anything. If you're going to the tire shop and the tire shop has shit tires,
[32:35.800 --> 32:40.280]  go to a different tire shop. If you don't shop at Kmart for the fucking tuxedo. I mean,
[32:40.280 --> 32:44.360]  if you want good quality, go shop around, look at different dispensaries, look at weed maps.
[32:45.080 --> 32:49.720]  I know weed maps is a weird thing. I, they don't pay me. I use weed maps. I know what I'm shopping
[32:49.720 --> 32:53.240]  for. I can go to weed maps and look at the dispensary and see what they've got. And then
[32:53.240 --> 32:56.680]  you don't have to go in there and look at all hundred jars and feel overwhelmed because that
[32:56.680 --> 33:03.160]  kind of sucks. Sometimes be leery of the review section as well. Take it, take your time to dig
[33:03.160 --> 33:11.400]  through because a lot of the more reputable sites like weed maps and a few of the others,
[33:11.400 --> 33:20.760]  leaf leaf leaf buyer, Google, they they let the business ding down bad reviews from time to time,
[33:20.760 --> 33:26.440]  but they won't let them take them all down. Especially the really legit, like spelled out
[33:26.440 --> 33:32.520]  bad reviews where the, the customer is specific with the complaints and not abusive in their
[33:32.520 --> 33:37.560]  language. Those all end up staying up. And if you scroll down a little bit, you'll get past all the
[33:37.560 --> 33:43.800]  $2 off your pre-roll for a five-star review reviews and get to the real meat of the store.
[33:43.800 --> 33:47.880]  And that's the stuff you're looking for, especially when it comes to like selection, pricing,
[33:48.440 --> 33:55.560]  service. And then their menus, are their menus updated? A lot of places, their menus haven't
[33:55.560 --> 33:58.920]  been updated in two months and you go in and you're like, oh man, I saw that they had to fire
[33:58.920 --> 34:02.360]  out the website. You go in there like, yeah, we've been sold out of that for four months. Let me show
[34:02.360 --> 34:08.680]  you not fire. Complain about that. Honestly, a lot of dispensaries, if you go in there and you
[34:08.680 --> 34:11.960]  say, hey, I see the golden goat. Can I get an eight, the golden goat? They're going to go,
[34:11.960 --> 34:15.000]  we don't have golden goat. You pull up that fucking weed maps page and go look, it shows
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.920]  right here that you got golden goat. They'll give you a deal. They'll do something for it because
[34:18.920 --> 34:22.920]  that is their responsibility to keep that shit updated. I've driven to a dispensary because
[34:22.920 --> 34:26.920]  they said they've had something they didn't, they felt really bad. They were like, hey,
[34:26.920 --> 34:30.200]  that girl that was supposed to be updating, it was actually there. She kind of got in trouble.
[34:30.200 --> 34:38.040]  I felt bad, but they gave me a fat deal. So that's something that every shop should be on top
[34:38.040 --> 34:43.000]  of. Don't feel bad about shopping for quality, leaving without a purchase or dinging them for
[34:43.000 --> 34:50.200]  inaccurate menus. Like this is just standard shit. Before I've talked about not tipping bud tenders
[34:50.200 --> 34:56.520]  because I feel like they, I don't know, sometimes it totally depends on the interaction. I always
[34:56.520 --> 34:59.800]  agreed with that part of it. I'm buying concentrates. Today I knew what I wanted. I was
[34:59.800 --> 35:03.560]  like, I want three of these things. And then basically the bud tender had to put three packs
[35:03.560 --> 35:08.920]  in a jar or in a baggie and hand them to me and take my money. Right. And I did tip today. At that
[35:08.920 --> 35:14.120]  point, you're tipping for them counting your change back correctly. Right. And she was smart
[35:14.120 --> 35:18.040]  enough to give me my change in ones, which is part of why she got a tip. She wasn't going to get all
[35:18.040 --> 35:22.040]  five of it, but since she gave it back in one, she got three of them because she was smart enough to
[35:22.040 --> 35:25.960]  break it down into some ones, which is, that was the only determining factors. Like if she gives me
[35:25.960 --> 35:30.680]  one, she's going to get a few of them. If she does not, she don't get five. Right. That wasn't worth
[35:30.680 --> 35:34.920]  five. It was worth three and they were super friendly. They're super nice. But I tipped,
[35:34.920 --> 35:41.320]  I would, I probably would have tipped too, but the guy that was in front of me was not pleasant. And
[35:41.320 --> 35:45.640]  I felt bad for the bud tenders. I was like, damn, that guy kind of just fucked your day up. So
[35:45.640 --> 35:49.880]  here's maybe this will fix it. You know, that's part of why I tip today. And I'm not against
[35:49.880 --> 35:56.440]  tipping a bud tender. I just, uh, I'm all about it, but before I didn't do it as frequently and
[35:56.440 --> 36:01.720]  you would have to do something to, I don't know. I almost always tip something, but some people
[36:01.720 --> 36:06.440]  definitely get the loose change and other people will get a five. Like it just, it completely
[36:06.440 --> 36:11.000]  depends on your interaction. If I walk in and go, give me two of those. And you just sort of nod at
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.440]  me and we're done. Like if I walk in and you know, when you're like, Oh, like this is in your wheelhouse,
[36:16.440 --> 36:21.960]  this came in just so you know, I, you might be getting a nice tip. Yeah. Uh, actually she had to
[36:21.960 --> 36:25.960]  go get those out of the back today. So she had to go for a little walk, carry some stuff. So I guess
[36:25.960 --> 36:30.840]  it was worth me helping her out. But yeah, the guy before me, bro was not pleasant. He was in a bad,
[36:30.840 --> 36:38.280]  bad mood today. Yup. I've been there both ways. Yeah. On both sides of that counter. Yup. Yeah.
[36:38.280 --> 36:44.200]  I've been both customers too. There's been some bad days out there. They happen. That's why we
[36:44.200 --> 36:51.000]  have these delicious concentrates. I want to take a dab after all this dab talk. I've got,
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  I'm looking at the rig and I'm looking at some hash New York city diesel. I'm going to get some
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.320]  of this, uh, Clementine cookies going. We'll take a dab and then we'll start, uh, I'll just start
[36:59.320 --> 37:04.440]  wrapping up the show right now. Mike, thanks for bringing your, uh, your, uh, little wrap up part
[37:04.440 --> 37:07.800]  to the show. Thanks for having more stuff to talk about on the podcast. It's always great to have
[37:07.800 --> 37:12.840]  your view, your opinion, your voice on the podcast. And then he went blank cause he's checking his
[37:12.840 --> 37:18.600]  phone to see if he's got more content that he can talk about. Um, I went to check Twitter real
[37:18.600 --> 37:22.840]  quick to see if there was another story right in front of me that, uh, I'm spacing out on.
[37:22.840 --> 37:27.640]  Um, the one I can think of is right now, especially if you're in Colorado, there's, uh,
[37:28.600 --> 37:32.840]  what they call a, an onsite consumption bill sitting on our governor's desk,
[37:32.840 --> 37:39.240]  miracle of miracles. Our state legislature kicked it up. I'm not sure the deadline for his signature
[37:39.240 --> 37:44.840]  has passed. I know there is one. You just grabbed a sheet of paper. Do you have the answer? I'm not,
[37:44.840 --> 37:49.640]  I don't know. I don't have the deadline written down as far as I know that it has passed the step
[37:49.640 --> 37:57.480]  before it is on his desk. It's just sitting there waiting for governor to sign it. It's tasting
[37:57.480 --> 38:04.760]  bill. Uh, it's a Senate bill 1258, one, two, five, eight. And what you can do is go to, you guys get
[38:04.760 --> 38:13.720]  a pen or type this into your web browser right now. It is www.colorado.gov slash governor slash
[38:14.440 --> 38:21.560]  share dash your dash comments. It's colorado.gov slash governor slash share your comments with
[38:21.560 --> 38:28.440]  dashes, share dash your comments. Go there. It's really easy. Any pothead can do it. I did it. It's
[38:28.440 --> 38:35.800]  super simple. Uh, there are a few questions. The question to answer number one, yes. Okay. I'm
[38:35.800 --> 38:39.720]  already answering the shit for you, making it easy. The question to answer to question number
[38:39.720 --> 38:46.600]  two, bill number one, two, five, eight. All right. Then it's going to ask you, are you opposed or
[38:46.600 --> 38:53.160]  for you are for it? All right. Then it's going to ask you to explain, say, please allow this
[38:53.160 --> 38:59.720]  tasting bill. This is something we need here in Colorado. Um, basically this, uh, if you're not
[38:59.720 --> 39:05.880]  familiar, it allows existing cannabis, legal cannabis businesses. So licensed dispensaries
[39:06.600 --> 39:14.200]  to allow onsite consumption of non combustible cannabis product. Um, so they can set up a little
[39:14.200 --> 39:20.840]  area where they could perfectly legally set up a dab bar or an edible sampling room where
[39:21.400 --> 39:27.880]  you can go in and while you're, you're shopping, bring yourself a driver just so you can enjoy
[39:27.880 --> 39:33.080]  yourself to the fullest and go in. If you've, you know, been looking at an edible, you haven't
[39:34.440 --> 39:37.880]  honed up and tried yet, but always just kind of notice while you're in there,
[39:37.880 --> 39:42.440]  Oh, what does the peanut butter booty tastes like? Or, um, fucking banana. What I need to
[39:42.440 --> 39:48.360]  try that. And you'll have a chance to just go in and get a smaller portion of it, get a sample of
[39:48.360 --> 39:53.720]  it and try it. Take a dab of an extract. Maybe you're not familiar with or a company you're not
[39:53.720 --> 39:57.560]  familiar with. There's a couple of different options that we'd be able to do that. We would
[39:57.560 --> 40:04.680]  not all allow to do right now. Um, if this bill gets signed, it's going to take a while to get
[40:04.680 --> 40:10.520]  implemented. It's going to take a while to figure out what best practices are and see exactly how
[40:10.520 --> 40:14.760]  it plays out. But this is a big step forward for Colorado. If it gets signed, this would be really
[40:14.760 --> 40:21.480]  great right now. Uh, brands do a thing called pop-ups. So say Mike and I, let's say we've got a
[40:21.480 --> 40:26.360]  dispensary, right? Mike and Jeff's fucking weed, Ross weed, hut, weed, hut. Yeah. Ganja Emporium,
[40:26.360 --> 40:31.560]  whatever we'd 10 shack. Uh, we say, Hey, on Friday, uh, the growth from your heart podcast
[40:31.560 --> 40:35.960]  is going to do a pop-up here and the growth from a heart, your heart, heart podcast right now,
[40:35.960 --> 40:41.080]  if they were to do a pop-up there, they can give away t-shirts. They can give away merchandise.
[40:41.080 --> 40:48.040]  They can do sales on marijuana products. They can give you a discount for coming and dropping in
[40:48.040 --> 40:51.560]  through the dispensary. If you buy through the dispensary, they can give you a discount on that
[40:51.560 --> 40:55.160]  brand through a certain time. Hey, while we're here, you get a deal on our product. You know
[40:55.160 --> 40:59.480]  what I mean? Meet and greet, shake their hand, get a key chain, get a t-shirt, get your picture with
[40:59.480 --> 41:04.600]  them, tag them on social media, interact a little bit. What I feel will happen now is these brands
[41:04.600 --> 41:09.720]  will show up and you will be able to actually get samples because they can't do that. Now they
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.040]  legally cannot give you a sample. You will be, they will show up. They will go into the tasting
[41:14.040 --> 41:19.720]  room and today will be Viola Labs sample day pop-up day at Mike and Jeff's.
[41:19.720 --> 41:24.520]  The company just comes in, samples out a couple of grams of their own product from the shop
[41:25.160 --> 41:29.400]  into the tasting room. And there's so many possibilities.
[41:30.520 --> 41:34.920]  Studly dude and a pretty girl just dabbing out people for the next two hours. People in line,
[41:34.920 --> 41:37.800]  just check out the new Viola. This is our new drop. This is our new drop.
[41:38.600 --> 41:43.640]  There's a couple of things I want to get up or bring up before we get through with this story.
[41:43.640 --> 41:50.360]  The first is if this passes, miracle of miracles, and this gets into practice, please don't fuck
[41:50.360 --> 41:57.640]  it up for the rest of us. Consume with, uh, not a clear head, but like know what you're getting into.
[41:57.640 --> 42:01.640]  Don't go, don't overdo it. Make an ass of yourself in front of everybody. Have an exit plan. What are
[42:01.640 --> 42:06.360]  you going to do after this dab? You've got to get home. Are you on your lunch break? Is this your
[42:06.360 --> 42:13.640]  first stab? Think it through. And, uh, the second point is the, the anti-pot community around the
[42:13.640 --> 42:19.160]  country, such as it is, is pretty shitty at most of what they're trying to do. But one of the things
[42:19.160 --> 42:24.360]  that are pretty good at is inundating a specific person in government with a lot of emails about a
[42:24.360 --> 42:30.760]  specific issue. Um, and this is one they've hit a couple of times and I'm not surprised it sat on
[42:30.840 --> 42:37.640]  the governor's desk as long as it has considering the amount of anti-pot, uh, um, contact the
[42:37.640 --> 42:42.040]  governor, tell him not to allow this. It'll lead to dead people on the roads that are that type
[42:42.040 --> 42:49.160]  posts I've seen. So, uh, get active, get informed, contact your governor. If you're in Colorado right
[42:49.160 --> 42:54.600]  now to contact, take a looper would be very, very helpful to the community. Um, I know a lot of
[42:54.600 --> 43:00.840]  people who have been dying to set up some sort of consumption area, room, lounge, whatever,
[43:00.840 --> 43:08.440]  and fully be legal. They don't want to do it in the gray market or as a church or a couple of the
[43:08.440 --> 43:12.760]  other things they've got going on right now. They want to be able to do it as part of their legal
[43:12.760 --> 43:18.760]  cannabis business. And this is a big, a big window of opportunity to do just that. And if we can,
[43:18.760 --> 43:25.000]  we should take it. Please, please do the vein on Jeff's forehead. Just raised like a quarter
[43:25.000 --> 43:28.280]  inch with that dab. I just took a gigantic dab. It might've been too big for the podcast,
[43:28.280 --> 43:30.840]  but I'm going to live. It feels like I'm swimming and there's no water here.
[43:31.880 --> 43:37.400]  Again, you guys, I'm going to try to read you this website, this URL after taking that dab. It is
[43:37.880 --> 43:48.760]  www.colorado.gov slash governor. Can you spell that G O V E R N O R slash share dash your dash
[43:48.760 --> 43:53.640]  comments. Excuse the drool in the cotton mouth at the same time that dab is kicking
[43:54.280 --> 43:58.200]  while I'm flying. Uh, but go there, you guys, it'll be pretty self-explanatory. If you've got
[43:58.200 --> 44:02.440]  half a brain, you'll be able to fill out the little questionnaire. It's real easy. Please do
[44:02.440 --> 44:07.320]  that. You do have to put in a, you have to sign it at the end. Don't be afraid. You guys get
[44:07.320 --> 44:13.320]  involved, get active. Don't be scared. We're all adults here. That's how you get what you want is
[44:13.320 --> 44:18.680]  by being involved with the politics, with the system. If you don't tell them what you want,
[44:18.680 --> 44:22.280]  they'll give you what you think you want. And they're always going to fuck you that way.
[44:23.240 --> 44:25.960]  All right, Mike, you got anything else? You're searching through the phone. I see your thumbs
[44:25.960 --> 44:33.640]  going crazy. Your eyes are Darton. Funny story to a acquaintance of ours is all, um, sorry,
[44:33.640 --> 44:37.720]  podcast people. I'm usually better than that with my phone on the show. Um,
[44:40.520 --> 44:46.360]  if you're not following this person already follow Tom angle on, uh, on Twitter, Facebook,
[44:46.360 --> 44:51.160]  pretty much any social media. He's, uh, basically leading the country in cannabis reporting right
[44:51.160 --> 44:59.160]  now. Tom angle. Is that with an E or an A A N G L E. Um, he's got to look, I just fucked Mike up.
[44:59.160 --> 45:04.680]  Mike is not the best when it comes to grammar and letters. I'm super bad at spelling and super bad
[45:04.680 --> 45:10.280]  at names and just Jeff just combined my two fucking yeah. His foes. I just superhero fought
[45:10.280 --> 45:16.600]  him. I'm the boss now. All right. I usually don't talk about memes. Uh, my favorite new meme is the
[45:16.600 --> 45:20.040]  lotion boss. And if you've seen the lotion boss, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't
[45:20.040 --> 45:28.680]  seen it, you'll see it soon enough. It's, uh, uh, on Twitter it's, uh, at Tom, a N G E L L.
[45:28.680 --> 45:33.800]  Uh, all one word. Tom angle. All right. Mike says to follow that guy. I will follow him also. I'll
[45:33.800 --> 45:39.080]  start paying attention. Um, cannabis reporting for Forbes. Um, pretty awesome social media.
[45:39.880 --> 45:45.240]  Um, yeah, definitely worth following. If you want to stay informed on cannabis news,

[45:52.040 --> 45:55.880]  cannabis laws on Facebook. You said you had a funny story. Was that something you were not
[45:55.880 --> 45:59.880]  going to share on the show? One of our coworkers got a tick on his back at a camp out with his
[45:59.880 --> 46:03.320]  kids last night. And he was like, I fucking seriously have a tick on my back. What do I do?
[46:03.320 --> 46:06.920]  And I just had to look at my phone and laugh at it for a minute. Cause a, that's a question for
[46:06.920 --> 46:10.840]  Google and B motherfucker. You got a tick on your back, but you can do about it now.
[46:11.800 --> 46:20.200]  Yuck. High five that dude for me. I'm excited. I five him. Sometimes it bites. Oh, sometimes it
[46:20.200 --> 46:27.000]  sucks. Yup. Oh, you guys. Sometimes it burrows the fuck in. Oh, I got a disgusting story about
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.800]  a tick, but we're going to save that for another podcast. This has been a good show. Uh, yeah,
[46:31.800 --> 46:35.800]  I lived in Kansas for a little while. That's all I'm going to say. If you can avoid it,
[46:35.800 --> 46:39.080]  don't there are ticks out there bigger than this fucking hash container, bro.
[46:39.400 --> 46:44.200]  Yeah. It's time to sign off and take a dab. I think, thank you so much for joining us. Mike

[48:43.000 --> 48:48.040]  itching to get back. You guys, he's got his keys in his hand. I just got several messages all at
[48:48.040 --> 48:51.400]  once. And I know what that means. I mean, that means both kids are screaming at the same time.
