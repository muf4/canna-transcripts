[00:17.020 --> 00:19.500]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[00:19.500 --> 00:21.100]  It's time for episode number 120
[00:21.100 --> 00:22.780]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:22.780 --> 00:27.140]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.140 --> 00:28.180]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.180 --> 00:29.580]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.580 --> 00:31.980]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.980 --> 00:33.340]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:33.340 --> 00:34.580]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.580 --> 00:36.380]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.380 --> 00:39.380]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.380 --> 00:41.340]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.340 --> 00:43.180]  I wanna thank you again for joining me.
[00:43.180 --> 00:45.420]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.460 --> 00:47.020]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.020 --> 00:49.100]  for letting me use their music on my show.
[00:49.100 --> 00:52.880]  Big shout out to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.180 --> 00:56.660]  You guys, this episode was fun to record.
[00:56.660 --> 00:57.660]  I had a few people over.
[00:57.660 --> 00:59.660]  We had our buddy Buzzy over, we had Mike over,
[00:59.660 --> 01:01.900]  and our good homie Sloppy was back.
[01:01.900 --> 01:03.820]  We did an episode about how to interact
[01:03.820 --> 01:05.860]  with law enforcement in case you're pulled over
[01:05.860 --> 01:08.220]  or in case you bump into the cops out in public
[01:08.220 --> 01:10.300]  or in case the cops come to your front door.
[01:10.300 --> 01:12.700]  There may be some useful advice in this one for you.
[01:12.700 --> 01:13.940]  Before we get to the podcast,
[01:13.940 --> 01:15.300]  I need to give a huge shout out
[01:15.300 --> 01:17.220]  to my friends at Hitman Glass.
[01:17.220 --> 01:18.180]  Tonight I'm sitting here hitting
[01:18.180 --> 01:20.180]  the Hitman E-Series sidecar,
[01:21.380 --> 01:23.820]  smoking some Turpec Sour Death Star,
[01:23.820 --> 01:25.180]  got some live resin.
[01:25.180 --> 01:26.740]  Big shout out to my friends at Hitman.
[01:26.740 --> 01:28.940]  When I buy a rig, I like to buy a rig made in America
[01:28.940 --> 01:31.560]  by an American, that's why I shop with Hitman Glass.
[01:31.560 --> 01:34.120]  Check them out at www.only3ws.
[01:34.120 --> 01:35.140]  I might've said four of them.
[01:35.140 --> 01:38.620]  It's www.hitmanglass.com.
[01:38.620 --> 01:41.260]  They take care of all your high quality glass needs.
[01:41.260 --> 01:43.280]  They get you a rig, they'll get you a nail.
[01:43.280 --> 01:44.440]  Also, make sure you follow
[01:44.440 --> 01:46.240]  at Hitman Glass Dougie on Instagram.
[01:46.240 --> 01:47.580]  That's my buddy Dougie.
[01:47.580 --> 01:49.000]  And if you're in California this summer,
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.400]  make sure you support the Chalice Festival.
[01:51.400 --> 01:54.680]  Chalice, hash, music, glass, and art.
[01:54.680 --> 01:56.600]  It's a SoCal festival.
[01:56.600 --> 01:57.900]  Do not miss it.
[01:58.760 --> 01:59.760]  All right, you guys, that's all I've got
[01:59.760 --> 02:01.000]  for shout outs and advertising.
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.520]  So I'm gonna let the music play
[02:02.520 --> 02:04.880]  and we're going to get into the episode
[02:04.880 --> 02:07.880]  about how to interact with law enforcement.
[02:07.880 --> 02:08.920]  Thanks for listening.
[02:16.060 --> 02:17.200]  So what I think we have learned today
[02:17.240 --> 02:20.400]  is that we need to sign like an emergency contact form
[02:20.400 --> 02:21.880]  for people when they come over and take dabs.
[02:21.880 --> 02:24.540]  Cause I try to fuck people up over here, apparently.
[02:24.540 --> 02:26.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the show.
[02:26.440 --> 02:28.120]  Sitting to my left is our good friend, Buzzy.
[02:28.120 --> 02:29.120]  How you doing today, my friend?
[02:29.120 --> 02:30.280]  Hey, all is well.
[02:30.280 --> 02:31.320]  Right on, thank you for joining me.
[02:31.320 --> 02:32.160]  No problem.
[02:32.160 --> 02:33.040]  Awesome.
[02:33.040 --> 02:34.380]  Over here, kind of in front of me a little bit,
[02:34.380 --> 02:35.960]  off to an angle is our good buddy, White Mike.
[02:35.960 --> 02:37.120]  Welcome back to the show, bro.
[02:37.120 --> 02:38.240]  Thanks, man, good to be here.
[02:38.240 --> 02:39.200]  Thanks for coming.
[02:39.200 --> 02:41.960]  Over here, even more in front of me is our buddy, Sloppy.
[02:41.960 --> 02:42.800]  How you doing, bro?
[02:42.800 --> 02:43.680]  Yo, yo, doing well.
[02:43.680 --> 02:44.520]  Right on, man.
[02:44.520 --> 02:45.360]  Thanks for coming.
[02:45.360 --> 02:46.180]  I don't get to see you often enough.
[02:46.180 --> 02:48.020]  Sure, that's why I shot over here like that.
[02:48.020 --> 02:50.020]  Bro, Sloppy was on time, if not early.
[02:50.020 --> 02:50.940]  I was fucking impressed.
[02:50.940 --> 02:52.140]  Good work, bro, thanks for coming.
[02:52.140 --> 02:52.980]  For sure.
[02:52.980 --> 02:53.820]  Awesome.
[02:53.820 --> 02:56.680]  We've got a topic that we're gonna talk about tonight.
[02:56.680 --> 02:58.520]  I'm gonna tell a little quick story.
[02:58.520 --> 03:01.980]  Yesterday, I was at work and one of my trimmers,
[03:01.980 --> 03:03.880]  I will not say his name just cause I got respect for him,
[03:03.880 --> 03:05.500]  one of my trimmers called me and he's like,
[03:05.500 --> 03:06.620]  hey bro, can you do me a favor?
[03:06.620 --> 03:07.820]  And I was like, anything for you, bro.
[03:07.820 --> 03:10.860]  And he said, can you come pick me up at the fire station?
[03:10.860 --> 03:12.580]  And I was like, well, what's going on?
[03:12.580 --> 03:14.220]  And he said, I got pulled over
[03:14.220 --> 03:17.820]  and they gave me a DUI for cannabis.
[03:17.820 --> 03:20.540]  So they gave him, they pulled him over.
[03:20.540 --> 03:22.380]  They had probable cause to pull him over.
[03:22.380 --> 03:24.480]  When they pulled up, walked up to the car,
[03:25.660 --> 03:29.060]  the car reeked of cannabis because he's a trimmer.
[03:29.060 --> 03:29.900]  I'm sure I reeked of cannabis.
[03:29.900 --> 03:30.900]  Occupational hazard, yeah.
[03:30.900 --> 03:31.820]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:31.820 --> 03:34.820]  So the cop was like, holy shit, you smell like cannabis.
[03:34.820 --> 03:38.220]  And my buddy was like, well, I'm a trimmer.
[03:38.220 --> 03:40.380]  And he's like, all right, well, get out of the car.
[03:40.380 --> 03:42.140]  I wanna give you a sobriety test.
[03:42.140 --> 03:43.500]  And my buddy failed the test.
[03:43.500 --> 03:44.820]  Okay.
[03:44.820 --> 03:45.900]  They then put him in the cop car
[03:45.900 --> 03:48.900]  and took him to the fire station and drew blood.
[03:48.900 --> 03:52.960]  At that point, they called me, my buddy called me
[03:52.960 --> 03:55.220]  and said that I can come pick him up.
[03:55.220 --> 03:56.700]  A couple of minutes later, my phone rang.
[03:56.700 --> 03:59.700]  It was my buddy saying, hey, the state trooper just said
[03:59.700 --> 04:02.820]  that if you look, smell or act high at all,
[04:02.820 --> 04:03.980]  he's going to arrest you.
[04:03.980 --> 04:07.460]  So be cool if you're coming or I'll call somebody else.
[04:07.460 --> 04:08.300]  And I was cool.
[04:08.300 --> 04:09.140]  I hadn't smoked since.
[04:09.140 --> 04:09.980]  Fair heads up.
[04:09.980 --> 04:10.860]  Yeah, it was early.
[04:10.860 --> 04:12.580]  It was like two in the afternoon.
[04:12.740 --> 04:15.020]  I don't even think I smoked before I went to work that day
[04:15.020 --> 04:17.300]  because I go to it too fucking early to smoke sometimes.
[04:17.300 --> 04:18.140]  Right.
[04:18.140 --> 04:18.980]  So I hadn't smoked all day.
[04:18.980 --> 04:19.800]  I was crispy.
[04:19.800 --> 04:20.640]  The only reason my eyes would be crispy is
[04:20.640 --> 04:21.900]  because I'd been up for too long working,
[04:21.900 --> 04:23.740]  you know, in the fucking grow room.
[04:23.740 --> 04:26.820]  So I drive over there and I call my buddy.
[04:26.820 --> 04:27.660]  I'm like, can you come out?
[04:27.660 --> 04:29.660]  And he goes, hold on, the cop's going to come talk to you.
[04:29.660 --> 04:31.740]  And I was like, oh fuck, he's going to come talk to me.
[04:31.740 --> 04:34.340]  And I got, I got my couple of friends in the car from work.
[04:34.340 --> 04:35.420]  I just brought everybody with me
[04:35.420 --> 04:37.060]  because I didn't want to leave them there without the boss.
[04:37.060 --> 04:39.300]  So I put them in the car, like a field trip for the boys
[04:39.300 --> 04:40.780]  and took them to the fire station.
[04:40.780 --> 04:41.940]  And then we, I get out of the car.
[04:41.940 --> 04:43.060]  I was like, you guys stay here.
[04:43.060 --> 04:44.540]  Somebody record this.
[04:44.540 --> 04:46.700]  So a couple of the people recorded the interaction
[04:46.700 --> 04:48.940]  on their cell phone, just in case shit went sloppy.
[04:48.940 --> 04:49.780]  Nothing went wrong.
[04:49.780 --> 04:51.060]  It was all good.
[04:51.060 --> 04:53.740]  So I walk up to the cop and he's like,
[04:53.740 --> 04:56.940]  so your buddy was pulled over for DUI.
[04:56.940 --> 04:58.820]  He's too intoxicated to drive.
[04:58.820 --> 05:01.820]  I've got the opportunity to either take him to jail
[05:01.820 --> 05:05.740]  and keep him, or I can release him to a responsible adult
[05:05.740 --> 05:07.620]  who will declare responsibility for him
[05:07.620 --> 05:10.140]  for the next eight hours.
[05:10.140 --> 05:12.940]  So I know the guy, he's a good dude
[05:12.940 --> 05:13.780]  and he's going to come work with,
[05:13.780 --> 05:15.300]  I needed him to fucking come work with me.
[05:15.300 --> 05:17.460]  He was on his way to work when he got pulled over.
[05:17.460 --> 05:19.580]  So I was like, yeah, man, I'll sign the paper.
[05:19.580 --> 05:21.140]  So the cop's like, I need your ID.
[05:21.140 --> 05:23.980]  And he took my ID and watched me write down my information
[05:23.980 --> 05:26.580]  as I was doing it and ran my license and shit.
[05:26.580 --> 05:27.500]  And he goes, you're not wanted.
[05:27.500 --> 05:28.420]  And I go, well, thanks.
[05:28.420 --> 05:30.180]  I've never felt more unwanted.
[05:30.180 --> 05:31.140]  He was like, I was sober.
[05:31.140 --> 05:33.460]  And it was kind of, the cop, I want to give him a shout out.
[05:33.460 --> 05:34.500]  I don't remember his name.
[05:34.500 --> 05:36.820]  He was really fucking cool for being a state trooper
[05:36.820 --> 05:38.700]  that had to give my friend a DUI.
[05:38.700 --> 05:40.580]  He gave us information on how to avoid
[05:40.580 --> 05:42.020]  getting ourselves in trouble.
[05:43.220 --> 05:46.300]  He said stuff like, don't smell like cannabis so strongly.
[05:46.300 --> 05:48.900]  Don't smell like cannabis, have expired plates
[05:48.900 --> 05:50.300]  and do these certain things.
[05:52.020 --> 05:54.020]  He said there were 15, he didn't tell us what they are.
[05:54.020 --> 05:57.500]  He said there are 15 things that they look for as main keys
[05:57.500 --> 05:59.180]  and my buddy hit nine of them.
[05:59.180 --> 06:03.320]  So he definitely got arrested, but they let him go to me.
[06:03.320 --> 06:05.060]  The cop was really cool,
[06:05.060 --> 06:07.260]  but I've been talking about doing this episode
[06:07.260 --> 06:09.980]  about what to do if you're involved with law enforcement.
[06:09.980 --> 06:11.660]  I feel like my buddy handled himself well.
[06:11.660 --> 06:13.500]  He told them he worked in the industry.
[06:13.500 --> 06:15.300]  He had to over, you wouldn't have gotten that call.
[06:15.300 --> 06:16.140]  Exactly, yeah.
[06:16.140 --> 06:16.960]  And he was peaceful.
[06:16.960 --> 06:18.100]  You would have gotten a very different call.
[06:18.100 --> 06:19.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:19.380 --> 06:20.580]  If you come out of the car like, what's up,
[06:20.580 --> 06:21.420]  why are you arresting me?
[06:21.420 --> 06:23.540]  You're not gonna get, you're gonna go to jail.
[06:23.540 --> 06:24.600]  They didn't even tow his car.
[06:24.600 --> 06:26.020]  They pulled it off to the side.
[06:26.020 --> 06:26.860]  Oh, they were extra decent about it.
[06:26.860 --> 06:27.700]  And they let someone come pick it up.
[06:27.700 --> 06:29.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:29.460 --> 06:32.000]  And they asked us a lot of questions and I'd quit.
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.780]  When I was picking him up, the cop asked basic questions
[06:35.780 --> 06:37.380]  and then he got friendly with us
[06:37.380 --> 06:40.300]  and started asking questions about the industry and work.
[06:40.300 --> 06:41.620]  And at one point I just shut up.
[06:41.620 --> 06:43.720]  I was like, oh, I don't wanna answer any more questions.
[06:43.720 --> 06:44.560]  He tricked me.
[06:44.560 --> 06:46.420]  He's my friend now and I'm telling him shit.
[06:46.420 --> 06:47.260]  It was fun.
[06:47.260 --> 06:48.100]  Dry snitching.
[06:48.100 --> 06:48.920]  Fuck off.
[06:48.920 --> 06:49.760]  Right, right.
[06:49.760 --> 06:50.580]  I was like, oh wait, nah, shut up, pause.
[06:50.580 --> 06:51.420]  Don't say any of this.
[06:51.420 --> 06:53.340]  I had to pull myself out of that one.
[06:53.340 --> 06:54.700]  But it brings us to this episode.
[06:54.700 --> 06:56.860]  It's a really good way to segue into this.
[06:58.020 --> 06:59.380]  You guys, don't drive high
[06:59.380 --> 07:00.660]  because they're out looking for people
[07:00.660 --> 07:01.660]  in Colorado right now.
[07:01.660 --> 07:02.580]  It's the start.
[07:02.580 --> 07:04.060]  This officer told us it's the start
[07:04.100 --> 07:05.820]  of their searching for DUI season.
[07:05.820 --> 07:08.220]  All of the state troopers have recently taken
[07:08.220 --> 07:10.340]  a drug expert class.
[07:10.340 --> 07:12.660]  A lot of the state troopers are now cannabis,
[07:12.660 --> 07:17.500]  cannabis intoxication or impairment experts or whatever.
[07:17.500 --> 07:19.620]  So where they could tell how high you are.
[07:19.620 --> 07:22.620]  And this cop said things that made me think he was serious.
[07:22.620 --> 07:25.840]  He knew stuff about my buddy being intoxicated
[07:25.840 --> 07:27.260]  that I know about cannabis.
[07:27.260 --> 07:28.780]  He knew that level.
[07:28.780 --> 07:31.140]  He said, your buddy doesn't look high or act high,
[07:31.140 --> 07:32.180]  but when I interviewed him,
[07:32.180 --> 07:34.500]  I can tell there are things inside of him
[07:34.500 --> 07:38.020]  that are going on that indicate that he's high.
[07:38.020 --> 07:40.380]  And I was like, well, that's kind of fucking like,
[07:40.380 --> 07:42.180]  I was impressed by the way that he put it.
[07:42.180 --> 07:43.980]  I'm like, all right, Jedi master.
[07:43.980 --> 07:45.460]  Right.
[07:45.460 --> 07:47.260]  Part medical training, like whatever.
[07:47.260 --> 07:48.100]  I don't know.
[07:49.820 --> 07:52.900]  So let's talk about some things that we could do
[07:52.900 --> 07:54.780]  to maybe help ourselves out
[07:54.780 --> 07:58.140]  and not get in as much trouble
[07:58.140 --> 07:59.460]  and maybe prevent ourselves,
[07:59.460 --> 08:03.540]  maybe hopefully walk away without any fucking handcuffs
[08:03.540 --> 08:05.820]  or maybe instead of getting all the way taken to the jail,
[08:05.820 --> 08:08.340]  keep yourself in a situation where they call Rasta Jeff
[08:08.340 --> 08:10.940]  and he gets to come pick you up and sign for you.
[08:10.940 --> 08:13.300]  So let's talk about like, if you get pulled over,
[08:15.140 --> 08:17.960]  you've told me your method, our friend Buzzy over here,
[08:17.960 --> 08:19.980]  he's told me his method of how to handle himself
[08:19.980 --> 08:21.280]  when he gets pulled over.
[08:21.280 --> 08:23.180]  So I'm gonna go around the table
[08:23.180 --> 08:26.420]  and I'll start with Buzzy cause he's to the left.
[08:26.420 --> 08:27.360]  You're driving down the street,
[08:27.360 --> 08:29.360]  you're on the interstate, you're driving.
[08:29.980 --> 08:31.340]  Maybe you got a little weed in the car,
[08:31.340 --> 08:32.780]  but it's hidden, it's cool.
[08:32.780 --> 08:33.620]  Oh, it's in Colorado.
[08:33.620 --> 08:35.140]  It's Colorado.
[08:35.140 --> 08:37.180]  But not all of our listeners are in Colorado.
[08:37.180 --> 08:39.500]  So a lot of these people are gonna be like,
[08:39.500 --> 08:40.340]  however many percent of them.
[08:40.340 --> 08:43.220]  Yeah, where you are is really gonna depend on
[08:43.220 --> 08:45.460]  what you should do before you get in the car.
[08:45.460 --> 08:47.980]  Also, if you are driving with weed,
[08:47.980 --> 08:49.540]  regardless of where you are,
[08:49.540 --> 08:52.100]  you should pretty much put it in the trunk always.
[08:52.100 --> 08:55.540]  And we're in no way endorsing breaking the law.
[08:55.540 --> 08:58.940]  Yeah, just we're gonna teach you
[08:58.940 --> 09:00.420]  how to be a little smarter about getting to and from.
[09:00.420 --> 09:02.980]  This is in Colorado where it's all gravy.
[09:02.980 --> 09:04.060]  All right then, yeah, okay.
[09:04.060 --> 09:05.540]  Then we'll stick with Colorado.
[09:05.540 --> 09:06.980]  This is Colorado out here.
[09:06.980 --> 09:07.820]  Yeah, yeah.
[09:07.820 --> 09:09.420]  I just feel like being a smart ass, I'm sorry.
[09:09.420 --> 09:10.820]  As you light up a big blunt.
[09:10.820 --> 09:12.020]  Let me find you an ashtray, bro.
[09:12.020 --> 09:13.980]  Here, just do it right here onto this table, right here.
[09:13.980 --> 09:15.500]  I was gonna ask him to this.
[09:15.500 --> 09:16.540]  Do that then.
[09:16.540 --> 09:17.540]  I'm a guy, man.
[09:17.540 --> 09:20.980]  MacGyver, MacGyver, MacBluntGyver, BluntGyver.
[09:20.980 --> 09:22.740]  I don't think you invented ashing
[09:22.740 --> 09:24.420]  into the Swisher package.
[09:24.420 --> 09:25.980]  I've done it before instead of just,
[09:25.980 --> 09:27.340]  I didn't wanna just ash on the stuff.
[09:27.340 --> 09:28.340]  I appreciate you, brother.
[09:28.340 --> 09:30.220]  All right, all right, let's order in the court.
[09:30.220 --> 09:31.860]  I'm tapping the gavel.
[09:31.860 --> 09:32.700]  So you're getting pulled over.
[09:32.700 --> 09:34.540]  You got, my buddy Buzz, you over here,
[09:34.540 --> 09:35.380]  you're getting pulled over.
[09:35.380 --> 09:36.620]  You got those red and blues behind you.
[09:36.620 --> 09:37.900]  They're flickering, bling, bling, bling.
[09:37.900 --> 09:40.140]  What am I getting pulled over for?
[09:40.140 --> 09:40.980]  Who the fuck knows?
[09:40.980 --> 09:41.940]  It's the cops, dude.
[09:41.940 --> 09:43.620]  Not using your blinker.
[09:43.620 --> 09:47.940]  Being in a car and driving and just being a person.
[09:47.940 --> 09:48.780]  Windows are tinted.
[09:48.780 --> 09:50.140]  They don't know what color you are in there.
[09:50.140 --> 09:52.900]  They have no idea what you're doing.
[09:52.900 --> 09:54.020]  I don't know.
[09:54.540 --> 09:55.380]  You're just pulled over.
[09:55.380 --> 09:56.220]  You don't even know yet.
[09:56.220 --> 09:57.060]  So you get pulled over.
[09:57.060 --> 09:58.900]  Cop walks up to the window,
[09:58.900 --> 10:01.220]  shines his light right in your goddamn face,
[10:01.220 --> 10:03.980]  and usually he'll say something like.
[10:03.980 --> 10:05.940]  Yeah, I would have the window rolled down
[10:05.940 --> 10:07.060]  before he gets there.
[10:07.060 --> 10:08.260]  Okay.
[10:08.260 --> 10:10.180]  Your hands should be on the steering wheel.
[10:10.180 --> 10:11.740]  All right, both hands on the steering wheel.
[10:11.740 --> 10:12.660]  Yeah, you wanna be able,
[10:12.660 --> 10:14.580]  the cop should be able to see both your hands.
[10:14.580 --> 10:19.260]  This is to, my method is avoid anything possible.
[10:19.300 --> 10:24.300]  Be extremely what the cop wants to happen.
[10:24.540 --> 10:27.220]  Give him the most desirable situation possible.
[10:27.220 --> 10:28.380]  Be submissive to him almost.
[10:28.380 --> 10:29.220]  Yeah, exactly.
[10:29.220 --> 10:32.660]  Because I'm just trying to avoid paying money to the state.
[10:32.660 --> 10:33.500]  Or getting shot.
[10:33.500 --> 10:34.620]  That's my goal.
[10:34.620 --> 10:37.220]  Right, so far his method and my method are very, very similar.
[10:37.220 --> 10:38.660]  Yeah, so you just keep your hands on the wheel.
[10:38.660 --> 10:40.540]  He's like, license registration.
[10:40.540 --> 10:41.540]  Say it's in my glove box.
[10:41.540 --> 10:42.580]  Can I reach into it?
[10:42.580 --> 10:43.500]  He says, sure.
[10:43.500 --> 10:44.340]  You go into it.
[10:44.340 --> 10:45.260]  You get your stuff out.
[10:45.260 --> 10:46.100]  Give it to him.
[10:46.100 --> 10:47.300]  Then, I don't know.
[10:47.340 --> 10:49.740]  Different things can happen from there.
[10:49.740 --> 10:52.100]  Okay, so he grabs your license.
[10:52.100 --> 10:53.540]  He's like, how you doing?
[10:53.540 --> 10:55.380]  You're like, I'm pretty good, sir.
[10:55.380 --> 10:56.220]  How about yourself?
[10:56.220 --> 10:58.140]  Probably is what, you're polite, dude.
[10:58.140 --> 10:58.980]  He's gonna be like,
[10:58.980 --> 11:00.860]  license registration, proof of insurance.
[11:00.860 --> 11:01.980]  He's gonna walk back to the car.
[11:01.980 --> 11:05.220]  Hopefully he's gonna come back and he's gonna say,
[11:05.220 --> 11:08.660]  my friend Buzzy, you were going a little too fast.
[11:08.660 --> 11:10.660]  Quit driving like an asshole in these parts.
[11:10.660 --> 11:12.860]  I'm just gonna give you a warning.
[11:12.860 --> 11:13.700]  Hopefully it goes well.
[11:13.700 --> 11:15.340]  So, the key to it,
[11:15.340 --> 11:18.060]  I think we're all gonna have the same story.
[11:18.060 --> 11:19.620]  Be polite to the cop.
[11:19.620 --> 11:22.500]  Don't try to be, know your rights,
[11:22.500 --> 11:24.220]  but don't try to invoke them immediately.
[11:24.220 --> 11:26.020]  When the cop comes up, give him what he wants.
[11:26.020 --> 11:29.100]  Until they start fucking with you.
[11:29.100 --> 11:31.060]  Like, the important thing to keep in mind here
[11:31.060 --> 11:34.420]  is that they have all the power and can execute you.
[11:36.060 --> 11:38.500]  I mean, not to fucking blunt it at all,
[11:38.500 --> 11:43.080]  99 times out of 100, or probably even more than that,
[11:43.080 --> 11:46.600]  you're gonna get annoyed, ticketed, and sent on your way.
[11:46.600 --> 11:49.760]  But, that one time out of however many,
[11:49.760 --> 11:51.840]  they're gonna freak out and shoot you in the face,
[11:51.840 --> 11:54.760]  or get pissed and drag you to jail.
[11:54.760 --> 11:56.840]  Or in some towns, the cops will just straight rob you
[11:56.840 --> 11:58.200]  and take your shit and leave you there.
[11:58.200 --> 12:00.120]  Take your shit and leave you on the side of the road.
[12:00.120 --> 12:02.120]  I wanna continue, we're in the same pullover.
[12:02.120 --> 12:03.280]  But that's what you gotta keep in mind.
[12:03.280 --> 12:07.920]  Exercise your rights, but if you follow the little script
[12:07.920 --> 12:09.680]  they're expecting, nine times out of 10,
[12:09.680 --> 12:11.520]  you're on your way in 10 minutes.
[12:11.520 --> 12:13.200]  All right, yeah, yeah, 10, 15 minutes,
[12:13.200 --> 12:14.960]  as long as it takes them to run your shit.
[12:14.960 --> 12:16.520]  All right, we're in the same pullover.
[12:16.520 --> 12:17.680]  You've gotten pulled over, you've gone through
[12:17.680 --> 12:19.560]  all the shit our buddy Buzzy over here has handled.
[12:19.560 --> 12:20.880]  But now when the cop comes back
[12:20.880 --> 12:22.760]  with your license, registration, proof of insurance,
[12:22.760 --> 12:27.160]  he goes, hey Mike, kinda smells like you got weed in there.
[12:27.160 --> 12:29.680]  I would like to search your vehicle.
[12:29.680 --> 12:31.480]  Now what's the proper response at this point?
[12:31.480 --> 12:33.800]  I don't consent to any searches, sir.
[12:33.800 --> 12:36.240]  Sloppy, do not endorse that one.
[12:36.240 --> 12:38.560]  We do not ever endorse running from the law enforcement
[12:38.560 --> 12:39.960]  unless it's in a video game.
[12:40.920 --> 12:42.360]  So, so.
[12:42.360 --> 12:44.920]  Just, I do not consent to any searches.
[12:44.920 --> 12:46.560]  There's just, you keep repeating that
[12:46.560 --> 12:48.440]  when they ask you to search your stuff.
[12:48.440 --> 12:49.280]  All right.
[12:49.280 --> 12:51.960]  They need major probable cause, and they'll make shit up.
[12:51.960 --> 12:54.920]  Like, you've got Altoids, that's probable cause
[12:54.920 --> 12:56.840]  because trunks use that to cover their breath.
[12:56.840 --> 12:59.400]  And you're like, that's not probable cause.
[12:59.400 --> 13:02.480]  What about, like myself, I work in a giant grow.
[13:02.480 --> 13:04.760]  I was trimming plants that were six feet tall today.
[13:04.760 --> 13:07.000]  I had to chop, I had to lean in between two plants
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.880]  and chop plants down and carry six foot tall plants.
[13:10.600 --> 13:11.520]  So am I sure, I probably reek.
[13:11.520 --> 13:12.960]  I've got trim on me right now.
[13:12.960 --> 13:14.640]  If I was coming from work and they said,
[13:14.640 --> 13:15.680]  you smell like marijuana,
[13:15.680 --> 13:17.240]  I work in the legal marijuana industry.
[13:17.240 --> 13:18.680]  That's just a side effect of my job.
[13:18.680 --> 13:21.920]  That's probably probable cause to search my vehicle though.
[13:21.920 --> 13:24.640]  Nah, be, I'm sorry to jump in.
[13:24.640 --> 13:27.160]  I would say be strong on distinguishing
[13:27.160 --> 13:29.440]  the different smells between smoked marijuana
[13:29.440 --> 13:30.640]  and fresh marijuana.
[13:31.760 --> 13:33.800]  This doesn't, this smell that you're smelling
[13:33.800 --> 13:34.640]  is work related.
[13:34.640 --> 13:36.000]  This is not smoked marijuana.
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.680]  This is the smell of a plant.
[13:37.920 --> 13:41.840]  At this point you're, like they're arguing about smells
[13:41.840 --> 13:43.240]  because you're not slurring your speech,
[13:43.240 --> 13:44.360]  because your eyes aren't red,
[13:44.360 --> 13:46.440]  because they didn't catch you weaving.
[13:46.440 --> 13:47.280]  So I came from a-
[13:47.280 --> 13:50.000]  So don't do that shit is probably one of the things
[13:50.000 --> 13:50.840]  we should put on the list
[13:50.840 --> 13:52.080]  to avoid getting your ass in trouble.
[13:52.080 --> 13:54.840]  If you're sober right now, you can argue it.
[13:54.840 --> 13:56.920]  This is a smell that I picked up at work,
[13:56.920 --> 13:58.800]  working while sober.
[13:58.800 --> 14:01.000]  I'm on my way home sober.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.320]  Like that's what you're smelling.
[14:02.320 --> 14:04.080]  If you insist on searching the car,
[14:04.080 --> 14:06.400]  like unless they're finding roaches in the ashtray
[14:06.400 --> 14:08.560]  or a dab rig in the cup holder.
[14:08.560 --> 14:09.760]  And put your shit away you guys.
[14:09.760 --> 14:11.000]  Yep, you're headed on the road.
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.480]  Yeah, have it out of reach.
[14:12.480 --> 14:15.760]  Have your stuff in a, if you've got a locked container,
[14:15.760 --> 14:17.160]  that would be ideal.
[14:17.160 --> 14:18.000]  That's what they'd prefer.
[14:18.000 --> 14:18.820]  Keep it in the trunk.
[14:18.820 --> 14:20.840]  I think we were talking about that earlier.
[14:20.840 --> 14:22.320]  Right, it works just like booze.
[14:22.320 --> 14:25.560]  If you've got a 12 pack in the backseat of the trunk,
[14:25.560 --> 14:26.640]  you're fine.
[14:26.640 --> 14:28.720]  If that 12 pack is open and the 12th one
[14:28.720 --> 14:30.560]  is in your cup holder, half drunk,
[14:30.560 --> 14:31.640]  you ain't fine no more.
[14:31.640 --> 14:33.560]  Sloppy, you lit up blunt and you never passed it to anybody.
[14:33.560 --> 14:34.760]  What's going on with you bro?
[14:34.760 --> 14:36.400]  I've hit it four times sir.
[14:37.600 --> 14:39.720]  I figured there's only two of us smoking it.
[14:39.720 --> 14:40.920]  I'll take a puff on that blunt.
[14:40.920 --> 14:43.200]  Hey, turn up, turn down for what?
[14:43.200 --> 14:46.120]  I'm not gonna turn down your blunt at the house.
[14:46.120 --> 14:48.200]  Thanks for coming man, I respect the blunt.
[14:48.200 --> 14:51.160]  Yeah, yeah, hey, hey, and I grew this.
[14:51.160 --> 14:53.000]  So that's part of why I wanna smoke it.
[14:53.000 --> 14:53.840]  That's why I was sitting over there,
[14:53.840 --> 14:54.960]  I was like what happened?
[14:54.960 --> 14:58.360]  My bad, I guess I'm so used to some of my friends
[14:58.360 --> 14:59.640]  just not wanting to smoke it.
[14:59.640 --> 15:01.740]  I just see her in face sales all day.
[15:01.740 --> 15:03.160]  They made me this stoned.
[15:03.160 --> 15:05.080]  They did this to me.
[15:06.120 --> 15:07.320]  All right, so Sloppy.
[15:07.320 --> 15:08.160]  Yes.
[15:08.160 --> 15:08.980]  I wanna hear about it.
[15:08.980 --> 15:09.880]  I'm a cop.
[15:09.880 --> 15:11.240]  I got the red and blue lights behind you.
[15:11.240 --> 15:12.720]  You're in the car.
[15:12.720 --> 15:14.120]  You're just cruising, you ain't done nothing wrong
[15:14.120 --> 15:14.960]  that you know of.
[15:14.960 --> 15:15.800]  Yeah.
[15:15.800 --> 15:17.800]  You pull over, I come up behind you.
[15:17.800 --> 15:18.680]  How do you handle yourself?
[15:18.680 --> 15:20.080]  What are you gonna do?
[15:20.080 --> 15:23.640]  Okay, so two different answers.
[15:23.640 --> 15:24.800]  When I was younger,
[15:24.800 --> 15:26.920]  because I have two totally different perspectives on this.
[15:26.920 --> 15:27.880]  That's why I got you here.
[15:27.880 --> 15:29.760]  From being an adolescent to being an adult,
[15:29.760 --> 15:30.800]  or you know what I'm saying,
[15:30.800 --> 15:32.840]  like from going from young to old.
[15:33.360 --> 15:34.200]  What I was just saying, I'm just talking.
[15:34.200 --> 15:37.040]  Now I remember why I don't smoke blunts.
[15:37.040 --> 15:37.880]  Yeah, sorry.
[15:37.880 --> 15:39.200]  That's all right, I did it.
[15:39.200 --> 15:40.040]  I did it.
[15:40.040 --> 15:41.120]  I really appreciated that.
[15:41.120 --> 15:43.800]  Yeah, see, it was out of respect for the blunt and my homie.
[15:43.800 --> 15:45.520]  Yeah, I could die happy right now.
[15:46.840 --> 15:47.680]  No.
[15:47.680 --> 15:49.320]  Gotta have goals.
[15:50.160 --> 15:52.400]  No, okay, so when I was younger,
[15:52.400 --> 15:54.560]  I was one of those, oh, fuck the police, man.
[15:54.560 --> 15:56.320]  They can't do shit to me.
[15:56.320 --> 15:59.260]  And I would approach the situation.
[15:59.260 --> 16:00.760]  They pull me over and I'd be like,
[16:00.760 --> 16:01.800]  why'd you pull me over?
[16:01.800 --> 16:04.680]  This and that, and I'd be really confrontational towards it
[16:04.680 --> 16:06.000]  and then I'd go to jail.
[16:06.000 --> 16:07.080]  And that's what would happen,
[16:07.080 --> 16:09.280]  because I was being confrontational in a scenario
[16:09.280 --> 16:10.480]  where I didn't need to.
[16:10.480 --> 16:12.240]  Nowadays, you comply.
[16:12.240 --> 16:15.460]  You fucking comply to everything they are asking you
[16:15.460 --> 16:20.320]  within reason, like, oh, why were you speeding this?
[16:20.320 --> 16:21.560]  Keep, like what Buzzy said,
[16:21.560 --> 16:23.240]  keep your hands where they can see them.
[16:23.240 --> 16:26.600]  My goal is to make the police officer feel comfortable.
[16:26.600 --> 16:29.520]  Like, as soon as they walk up to the window,
[16:29.520 --> 16:30.640]  that should be your best friend.
[16:30.680 --> 16:32.680]  Like, oh, those teeth are mighty white today, sir.
[16:32.680 --> 16:34.320]  You're looking real sharp in that clothes.
[16:34.320 --> 16:37.640]  Like, it's nice and sunny out, right?
[16:37.640 --> 16:39.440]  Don't say the phrase mighty white.
[16:39.440 --> 16:42.120]  Just say the phrase mighty white to the cops.
[16:42.120 --> 16:45.600]  All right, so without putting myself out there too much,
[16:45.600 --> 16:49.480]  I was driving, not high at the moment,
[16:49.480 --> 16:52.680]  going 15 over and I had weed on me.
[16:52.680 --> 16:54.880]  This is back in North Carolina or whatever.
[16:55.800 --> 16:58.200]  And I got pulled over and I had Colorado plates
[16:58.200 --> 16:59.600]  because I had a rental car.
[17:00.160 --> 17:04.280]  I'm going 15 over and I just, I was like, fuck.
[17:04.280 --> 17:05.120]  You know what I'm saying?
[17:05.120 --> 17:09.440]  Like, dude got out of the car with his cowboy hat.
[17:09.440 --> 17:13.280]  Like, he had a cowboy hat and his badge was on the hat.
[17:13.280 --> 17:14.680]  He was fucking serious.
[17:14.680 --> 17:18.320]  Yeah, so what happened was I drove back to North Carolina.
[17:18.320 --> 17:19.400]  I brought a little bit of personal
[17:19.400 --> 17:20.520]  because I didn't want to deal with no,
[17:20.520 --> 17:22.600]  like, fucking ratchet shit to get weed back there.
[17:22.600 --> 17:23.840]  Fuck that, I got weed now.
[17:23.840 --> 17:25.320]  I actually got pulled over in Kansas.
[17:25.320 --> 17:27.120]  Worst place to get pulled over ever.
[17:27.120 --> 17:28.840]  So he got out with the badge on his hat
[17:28.840 --> 17:31.480]  and I was like, oh, he's gonna shoot me and my dogs.
[17:31.480 --> 17:34.400]  I had two little puppies, but, so I'm nervous.
[17:34.400 --> 17:37.000]  I'm like, fuck, fuck, fuck Colorado plates.
[17:37.000 --> 17:40.920]  And I remember right until he was in my peripherals,
[17:40.920 --> 17:42.800]  I was nervous, like scared.
[17:42.800 --> 17:45.160]  And as soon as he was at, I sung to him.
[17:45.160 --> 17:48.360]  He was, I could have sung him a whole disc.
[17:48.360 --> 17:49.920]  I was so nice to him.
[17:49.920 --> 17:52.160]  And he asked me why I was speeding.
[17:53.760 --> 17:56.560]  I was like, officer, I've been driving for like eight hours.
[17:56.640 --> 17:59.760]  I saw that there's a rest area up there.
[17:59.760 --> 18:01.360]  I was honestly just trying to make it there
[18:01.360 --> 18:02.640]  so I can go to sleep.
[18:02.640 --> 18:04.480]  Runs my stuff.
[18:04.480 --> 18:06.560]  Now I don't know how the police things work,
[18:06.560 --> 18:08.920]  but I'm pretty sure that when they run my name
[18:08.920 --> 18:11.320]  in any state, they can see my criminal background.
[18:11.320 --> 18:13.320]  I'm pretty sure it goes from state to state.
[18:13.320 --> 18:14.160]  So he saw that I had it.
[18:14.160 --> 18:16.960]  It's not perfect, but the bigger stuff, yes.
[18:16.960 --> 18:19.760]  Yeah, I'm sure he saw I had a record.
[18:19.760 --> 18:21.600]  And he treated me totally respectfully.
[18:21.600 --> 18:23.040]  He looked at me, he said,
[18:23.040 --> 18:24.640]  I pulled you over because you were speeding
[18:24.640 --> 18:26.540]  and I wanted to really come talk to you
[18:27.520 --> 18:28.340]  because of your Colorado plates.
[18:28.340 --> 18:30.940]  I wanted to see if you have anything to hide from me,
[18:30.940 --> 18:33.380]  but obviously you don't have a good day.
[18:33.380 --> 18:34.220]  And then he left me.
[18:34.220 --> 18:35.940]  Didn't even give me the speeding ticket.
[18:35.940 --> 18:39.360]  And it's all because I made him feel comfortable
[18:39.360 --> 18:40.200]  and I was polite.
[18:40.200 --> 18:43.380]  Because 15 over, they could take your license on the spot
[18:43.380 --> 18:44.860]  if they really want to be a dick.
[18:44.860 --> 18:48.340]  And we were in Kansas and I had two pit bulls in the car.
[18:48.340 --> 18:49.740]  And after he left, I threw up
[18:49.740 --> 18:51.340]  because I was like, oh my God.
[18:51.340 --> 18:53.900]  I really thought.
[18:53.900 --> 18:56.580]  Yeah, I really thought I was going back to jail.
[18:56.580 --> 18:57.700]  And I was like, I hate life.
[18:57.700 --> 18:59.340]  They're going to take my dogs.
[18:59.340 --> 19:01.820]  But I could have handled it like when I was younger
[19:01.820 --> 19:03.940]  and been an asshole and got my dog shot
[19:03.940 --> 19:06.380]  and got fucking tasered or killed myself
[19:06.380 --> 19:08.140]  or thrown back in jail.
[19:08.140 --> 19:09.060]  But I was polite.
[19:09.060 --> 19:09.880]  That's what I hate.
[19:09.880 --> 19:12.580]  I hate seeing all these videos where they're like,
[19:13.700 --> 19:15.700]  oh, that's police abuse.
[19:15.700 --> 19:17.300]  That's police abuse.
[19:17.300 --> 19:20.680]  But the dude isn't doing what the police is asking him.
[19:20.680 --> 19:22.320]  Like lay down on the ground.
[19:22.320 --> 19:23.880]  Lay the fuck down.
[19:23.880 --> 19:26.880]  Like why do you want to get DDT'd?
[19:26.880 --> 19:28.320]  I just don't see the point.
[19:28.320 --> 19:31.060]  Like they're pointing, like I saw a video.
[19:32.280 --> 19:33.880]  I saw a video.
[19:33.880 --> 19:36.220]  The police had a gun pointed at a guy.
[19:37.080 --> 19:40.560]  He had a knife and he lunged at him and they shot him.
[19:40.560 --> 19:43.600]  And people were like, unnecessary force.
[19:43.600 --> 19:44.840]  You're a fucking hypocrite.
[19:44.840 --> 19:46.680]  Because if you have a legal gun on you
[19:46.680 --> 19:48.220]  and I come and try to stab you right now,
[19:48.220 --> 19:49.500]  you're going to shoot me, you faggot.
[19:49.500 --> 19:52.500]  So don't fucking, don't be dating on the police.
[19:52.500 --> 19:55.220]  And when I say faggot, I don't mean gay people.
[19:55.220 --> 19:56.060]  So don't be all uptight about that.
[19:56.060 --> 19:57.660]  Maybe it's an old school version of the word.
[19:57.660 --> 19:58.500]  Yeah, for sure.
[19:58.500 --> 19:59.940]  Don't be a little fucking bitch about it.
[19:59.940 --> 20:00.900]  Don't be a little faggot.
[20:00.900 --> 20:02.740]  Like, because if I try to stab you, you're going to shoot me.
[20:02.740 --> 20:03.580]  If you say it one more time,
[20:03.580 --> 20:04.420]  we're going to have to do something about it.
[20:04.420 --> 20:05.240]  Yeah.
[20:05.240 --> 20:06.420]  I mean, yeah.
[20:06.420 --> 20:09.240]  But no, I hate that because people are so hypocritical
[20:09.240 --> 20:12.220]  because if they put themselves in the same position,
[20:12.220 --> 20:14.540]  they would act totally different than what they're speaking.
[20:14.540 --> 20:17.160]  And I hate that because if you try to stab me,
[20:17.160 --> 20:18.620]  I'm shooting you if I have a legal firearm.
[20:18.740 --> 20:21.140]  Yeah, stand in front of that guy with a knife
[20:21.140 --> 20:22.420]  and I'll give you half a second to decide.
[20:22.420 --> 20:23.340]  Are you going to shoot him or not?
[20:23.340 --> 20:24.180]  You're shooting him every time.
[20:24.180 --> 20:25.660]  You're shooting him six or eight times.
[20:25.660 --> 20:26.500]  Yeah, like what?
[20:26.500 --> 20:27.320]  Six or eight times.
[20:27.320 --> 20:28.160]  Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.
[20:28.160 --> 20:29.660]  You can tell that gun goes click, click, click, click.
[20:29.660 --> 20:30.500]  The judges will be like,
[20:30.500 --> 20:32.020]  why didn't you shoot him 17 times?
[20:32.020 --> 20:33.420]  There was only 16 bullets.
[20:33.420 --> 20:34.940]  That was a big Lebowski reference
[20:34.940 --> 20:37.100]  for all the people that didn't get it.
[20:37.100 --> 20:38.940]  I didn't click, click, click.
[20:38.940 --> 20:41.940]  The real trick here though is to just be calm
[20:41.940 --> 20:44.500]  and go through the script that they're expecting.
[20:44.500 --> 20:46.560]  And that's really easy to do
[20:46.560 --> 20:48.640]  if you're not doing something
[20:48.640 --> 20:50.280]  you're not supposed to be doing.
[20:51.360 --> 20:52.560]  But a lot of people are doing something
[20:52.560 --> 20:54.560]  we shouldn't be doing a lot of the time.
[20:54.560 --> 20:56.320]  I remember how it used to be in Colorado.
[20:56.320 --> 20:58.280]  I used to have to drive and go pick up weed
[20:58.280 --> 20:59.600]  and drive it home all the time.
[20:59.600 --> 21:02.540]  And that was the time that I was most at risk
[21:02.540 --> 21:04.320]  is when I just went and picked up a new quarter
[21:04.320 --> 21:05.960]  and had to drive it home.
[21:05.960 --> 21:08.360]  And I made it real easy on myself.
[21:08.360 --> 21:10.200]  I threw it in a backpack when I bought it.
[21:10.200 --> 21:13.040]  I threw that backpack in the trunk when I got to the car.
[21:13.040 --> 21:14.800]  If I got pulled over on the way home,
[21:14.800 --> 21:17.600]  it wasn't for speeding because I did my damnedest
[21:17.600 --> 21:19.920]  not to break a single traffic law with weed in the car.
[21:19.920 --> 21:22.800]  But I got pulled over plenty of times with weed in the car.
[21:22.800 --> 21:24.480]  And when they walk up to your car
[21:24.480 --> 21:25.640]  and you go, good evening officer,
[21:25.640 --> 21:28.920]  and it doesn't stink like weed in the car, you're fine.
[21:28.920 --> 21:30.520]  They go, oh, I pulled you over for this.
[21:30.520 --> 21:31.560]  Let me run your shit.
[21:31.560 --> 21:32.760]  Oh, here's your ticket.
[21:32.760 --> 21:34.040]  Have a good night.
[21:34.040 --> 21:36.200]  You show up to court, you pay that bitch, it's done.
[21:36.200 --> 21:39.200]  Quit driving 105 on I-25, Rasta Jeff.
[21:39.200 --> 21:40.040]  Right?
[21:40.040 --> 21:40.880]  Here's your ticket.
[21:40.880 --> 21:41.700]  Cruise control.
[21:41.700 --> 21:44.940]  I also think looking them in the eyes is key.
[21:44.940 --> 21:45.780]  Yeah.
[21:45.780 --> 21:47.020]  Because if you're hiding something,
[21:47.020 --> 21:48.020]  you're like, take off your shades.
[21:48.020 --> 21:49.500]  Yeah, be respectful.
[21:49.500 --> 21:51.620]  Like if you can be calm and confident,
[21:51.620 --> 21:54.140]  they don't wonder why you're nervous
[21:54.140 --> 21:57.000]  and try to figure out why you're freaking out
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.340]  and wanna dig through your car.
[21:58.340 --> 22:00.220]  The hardest part for me is when they make you
[22:00.220 --> 22:01.380]  sign the ticket.
[22:01.380 --> 22:04.220]  Like normally I sign my name, like I get a little motion,
[22:04.220 --> 22:06.100]  but then you get all nervous and your shit looks like
[22:06.100 --> 22:08.140]  a fucking polygraph or some shit.
[22:08.140 --> 22:10.540]  You're like, I'm okay, thanks officer.
[22:10.540 --> 22:11.940]  Right, it's all good until you look like
[22:11.940 --> 22:13.540]  you've got a major neurological disorder
[22:13.540 --> 22:14.380]  when you sign your ticket.
[22:14.380 --> 22:15.220]  Yeah, that's the best part.
[22:15.220 --> 22:17.460]  I always sign sloppy, so like if that happens,
[22:17.460 --> 22:18.780]  I guess I don't know what I'm gonna,
[22:18.780 --> 22:20.500]  I just try to sign my real name.
[22:20.500 --> 22:22.020]  You're gonna end up going to jail and they're gonna,
[22:22.020 --> 22:24.980]  uh oh, our buddy's headphones here have taken a poo on us.
[22:24.980 --> 22:25.820]  Are they back now?
[22:25.820 --> 22:26.640]  You in business?
[22:26.640 --> 22:28.380]  Yeah, it's this connection here.
[22:28.380 --> 22:30.260]  You're gonna sign sloppy one time
[22:30.260 --> 22:31.620]  and they're gonna make that your real name.
[22:31.620 --> 22:33.220]  You're gonna have to sign everything as sloppy.
[22:33.220 --> 22:34.220]  It's my alias.
[22:34.220 --> 22:35.060]  Yeah, okay.
[22:35.060 --> 22:38.180]  Under the NC inmate, whatever, it says sloppy.
[22:38.180 --> 22:40.020]  I, unfortunately.
[22:40.660 --> 22:43.900]  I got arrested once and my hat said sloppy on it.
[22:43.900 --> 22:46.420]  And so they take it down because it's your gang name now.
[22:46.420 --> 22:47.260]  He brought it to me.
[22:47.260 --> 22:49.700]  He was like, I can only assume that you're sloppy, huh?
[22:49.700 --> 22:50.740]  And I was like, fuck.
[22:50.740 --> 22:52.860]  I also had it tatted on my arm for a while.
[22:52.860 --> 22:53.700]  So there was no.
[22:53.700 --> 22:56.500]  Wait, you had it on your arm for a while?
[22:56.500 --> 22:57.460]  It's covered up now.
[22:57.460 --> 22:58.500]  That makes more sense to me.
[22:58.500 --> 22:59.340]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:59.340 --> 23:00.980]  How did this dude have a tattoo for a while?
[23:00.980 --> 23:05.620]  I have covered all of my gang affiliation tattoos.
[23:05.620 --> 23:06.460]  Nice work.
[23:06.460 --> 23:08.060]  You're trying to be a good person now, bro.
[23:08.060 --> 23:09.620]  I'm trying not to be a target.
[23:10.460 --> 23:12.220]  One of the old heads one day looked at me and said,
[23:12.220 --> 23:14.340]  all that is is a bullseye for everybody
[23:14.340 --> 23:16.020]  that doesn't like you and the police.
[23:16.020 --> 23:19.820]  And I said, oh my God, that is genius.
[23:19.820 --> 23:21.100]  He's like, well, you walk down the street,
[23:21.100 --> 23:22.340]  you're just telling everybody,
[23:22.340 --> 23:23.860]  like you don't need to do that.
[23:23.860 --> 23:25.700]  I was like, oh, that makes a lot of sense.
[23:25.700 --> 23:26.540]  Yep, yep, yep.
[23:26.540 --> 23:27.380]  All right, all right.
[23:27.380 --> 23:28.580]  So now let's move on.
[23:28.580 --> 23:30.740]  We all know what to do if you get pulled over now.
[23:30.740 --> 23:33.380]  Pull the fuck over as quickly as you can safely.
[23:33.380 --> 23:34.620]  Quickly, safely pull the fuck over.
[23:34.620 --> 23:35.580]  Keep your hands where they can see them.
[23:35.580 --> 23:36.420]  Let the cop come up.
[23:36.420 --> 23:39.060]  He's going to be like, I want your shit.
[23:39.420 --> 23:41.100]  Don't flirt with a female cop.
[23:41.100 --> 23:41.940]  No.
[23:41.940 --> 23:43.780]  That pisses her off so bad.
[23:43.780 --> 23:44.620]  Don't do that.
[23:44.620 --> 23:45.780]  Don't call her Ms. Carter.
[23:45.780 --> 23:46.620]  None of that shit.
[23:46.620 --> 23:47.780]  None of that shit.
[23:47.780 --> 23:50.020]  So the cop will come up, he'll be like, hey, what's up?
[23:50.020 --> 23:51.740]  And be like, yes, sir, no, sir.
[23:52.740 --> 23:53.980]  Let that interaction go smoothly.
[23:53.980 --> 23:55.320]  When they ask for your stuff,
[23:55.320 --> 23:56.300]  tell them you're going to reach for it.
[23:56.300 --> 23:57.940]  I'm going to reach for into the glove box.
[23:57.940 --> 23:59.420]  Ask them to reach for it.
[23:59.420 --> 24:00.260]  Ask them if you can.
[24:00.260 --> 24:01.100]  You better than tell them.
[24:01.100 --> 24:01.940]  Can I reach in my glove box
[24:01.940 --> 24:03.780]  and grab my license, registration, proof of insurance?
[24:03.780 --> 24:04.620]  I'm going to reach in my pocket,
[24:04.620 --> 24:05.820]  get my wallet out now, please.
[24:05.820 --> 24:07.380]  All right, don't shoot me, sir.
[24:07.380 --> 24:08.220]  Then hand him your stuff.
[24:08.220 --> 24:10.700]  I recommend everybody records interactions
[24:10.700 --> 24:12.940]  with the police as soon as you're pulled over,
[24:12.940 --> 24:15.460]  turn your camera phone on, place it somewhere.
[24:15.460 --> 24:16.860]  Or like, you know what I'm saying?
[24:16.860 --> 24:18.380]  Just stream it live.
[24:18.380 --> 24:19.620]  Stream it, periscope.
[24:19.620 --> 24:20.940]  Periscope that shit.
[24:20.940 --> 24:22.100]  Periscope it for sure.
[24:22.100 --> 24:25.020]  For sure, because then, like, yo, I mean, why not?
[24:25.020 --> 24:26.060]  At least it's there.
[24:27.780 --> 24:30.620]  I don't want everyone seeing me cry on periscope.
[24:30.620 --> 24:32.540]  If you can, record it.
[24:34.260 --> 24:35.100]  Though you're not.
[24:35.100 --> 24:35.940]  Call my mama.
[24:35.940 --> 24:36.780]  Someone call my mama.
[24:36.780 --> 24:37.620]  I'm going to jail.
[24:38.980 --> 24:41.900]  It's an extra layer of protection for everybody.
[24:41.900 --> 24:43.540]  And if you're lucky, you live in a place
[24:43.540 --> 24:45.780]  where the cops have cameras stuck to their chest
[24:45.780 --> 24:48.860]  that they can't turn off, but you're not lucky.
[24:48.860 --> 24:51.380]  And then when you drive away,
[24:51.380 --> 24:53.420]  don't get all nervous and do something stupid.
[24:53.420 --> 24:55.260]  Right, try not to peel out as you go.
[24:55.260 --> 24:56.780]  Yeah, don't celebrate too hard.
[24:56.780 --> 24:57.620]  I've done it before.
[24:57.620 --> 24:59.340]  Like, it's burn.
[24:59.340 --> 25:01.500]  Sorry, officer, I was nervous as shit.
[25:01.500 --> 25:02.420]  I just got away.
[25:02.420 --> 25:03.260]  I might have sneezed.
[25:03.260 --> 25:05.540]  Sneeze right into the microphone.
[25:05.540 --> 25:06.980]  I would sneeze away.
[25:06.980 --> 25:09.060]  Something else I was thinking about earlier today
[25:09.060 --> 25:11.260]  that I had to realize as an adult
[25:11.260 --> 25:15.300]  is not every officer is a fucking scumbag.
[25:15.300 --> 25:16.140]  You know what I'm saying?
[25:16.140 --> 25:18.100]  By saying that, every officer is just trying
[25:18.100 --> 25:20.900]  to make your day worse is basically being racist.
[25:20.900 --> 25:23.500]  It's like the same as labeling a racist doing something.
[25:23.500 --> 25:27.060]  Yeah, like, God, it's just jobist or some shit.
[25:27.060 --> 25:29.060]  Every fast food person is going to be an asshole
[25:29.060 --> 25:30.540]  and every cop's trying to fuck you over.
[25:30.540 --> 25:32.340]  Because I've seen cool cops.
[25:32.340 --> 25:34.900]  I've interacted with cops who are literally
[25:34.900 --> 25:36.140]  just trying to do their jobs.
[25:36.260 --> 25:37.500]  I've seen cops that have given me,
[25:37.500 --> 25:41.620]  so when I was younger, like 24, 25-ish,
[25:41.620 --> 25:44.460]  my girlfriend at the time worked, managed a bar,
[25:44.460 --> 25:46.740]  and we would go smoke in the alley.
[25:46.740 --> 25:48.020]  There was an alleyway that went one way
[25:48.020 --> 25:48.940]  and you could turn left or right
[25:48.940 --> 25:50.420]  to come into the parking lot of the bar.
[25:50.420 --> 25:52.940]  If you go the other way, you'll go through another area.
[25:52.940 --> 25:54.700]  This cop would roll through and he knew we were out there
[25:54.700 --> 25:56.380]  just puffing all the time in that alley
[25:56.380 --> 25:58.140]  because you could just walk right out of the side door
[25:58.140 --> 25:59.500]  of the bar and go sit in this little area
[25:59.500 --> 26:00.940]  between cars and smoke.
[26:00.940 --> 26:03.060]  And when he would come through, he'd flash his brights.
[26:03.060 --> 26:04.900]  So we'd be able to put our shit away and be prepared
[26:05.100 --> 26:06.460]  so he wouldn't have to fuck with us.
[26:06.460 --> 26:08.220]  He would just rather not see us smoking
[26:08.220 --> 26:10.140]  or maybe he's got somebody else in the car.
[26:10.140 --> 26:11.380]  But not all cops are assholes.
[26:11.380 --> 26:12.460]  That guy was trying to help us out,
[26:12.460 --> 26:14.620]  like not have to do paperwork and fuck with us
[26:14.620 --> 26:17.060]  just because we want to smoke some weed.
[26:17.060 --> 26:18.060]  Oh, sorry.
[26:18.060 --> 26:20.900]  Oh, no, I've just had dozens of interactions with cops.
[26:20.900 --> 26:22.540]  When I was a teenager, I used to get pulled over
[26:22.540 --> 26:23.820]  like twice a week.
[26:23.820 --> 26:26.300]  I had a car that had really loud subwoofers
[26:26.300 --> 26:27.740]  in the area I grew up in.
[26:27.740 --> 26:29.540]  That made me the biggest target on the planet.
[26:29.540 --> 26:31.540]  Yeah, for sure, I've seen that happen.
[26:31.540 --> 26:34.780]  But if you follow the script nine times out of 10,
[26:35.620 --> 26:37.220]  you're out of there in 15 minutes tops.
[26:37.220 --> 26:41.980]  We never see, we rarely see any good shit about the cops
[26:41.980 --> 26:44.660]  on the news, on the internet, on TV, anywhere like that
[26:44.660 --> 26:47.260]  because you rarely hear anything about the good shit.
[26:47.260 --> 26:48.420]  When people do good shit, it's like,
[26:48.420 --> 26:50.460]  oh yeah, that cop helped that old lady up.
[26:50.460 --> 26:51.460]  It's his fucking job.
[26:51.460 --> 26:53.980]  You only see cop kick the guy in the face.
[26:53.980 --> 26:57.220]  That's actually, as soon as he's.
[26:57.220 --> 26:58.300]  No, no, let's hear it.
[26:58.300 --> 26:59.140]  I love it.
[26:59.140 --> 27:00.180]  In psychology class, I learned about this.
[27:00.180 --> 27:02.220]  That's actually life period.
[27:02.220 --> 27:04.580]  If you notice like people talking about stuff a lot
[27:05.340 --> 27:07.340]  or even the news, it's never good stuff
[27:07.340 --> 27:10.860]  because even though it's unknown,
[27:10.860 --> 27:14.180]  you don't realize that good stuff is happening all the time.
[27:14.180 --> 27:17.420]  So that bad stuff is a blip on the radar.
[27:17.420 --> 27:19.340]  And that's what you remember and reference to
[27:19.340 --> 27:21.740]  because it's usually things are copacetic.
[27:21.740 --> 27:23.940]  So when something bad happens, it really sticks out.
[27:23.940 --> 27:25.060]  And that's what people wanna hear.
[27:25.060 --> 27:28.060]  They don't wanna hear like, 100 kids were saved today.
[27:28.060 --> 27:30.980]  They wanna hear puppies getting kicked off of a cliff.
[27:30.980 --> 27:32.100]  People are fucked up, man.
[27:33.060 --> 27:35.500]  They see bad stuff and it gives them.
[27:35.500 --> 27:37.700]  Puppies getting kicked off of a cliff.
[27:37.700 --> 27:39.980]  I see like a fucking vine of six seconds
[27:39.980 --> 27:41.780]  of just somebody punting puppies.
[27:41.780 --> 27:43.300]  And it just replays over and over
[27:43.300 --> 27:44.500]  in my fucking head right now.
[27:44.500 --> 27:49.500]  I personally feel like people want to see bad things.
[27:50.420 --> 27:54.260]  So they have a reason to fuel unnecessary fire
[27:54.260 --> 27:56.740]  to complain about why they're not doing well
[27:56.740 --> 27:59.860]  or to use it to why things are so fucked up,
[27:59.860 --> 28:00.700]  this and that.
[28:01.700 --> 28:04.100]  Especially like, oh man, here in America,
[28:05.140 --> 28:07.100]  we are so privileged as Americans.
[28:07.100 --> 28:10.220]  I hate this whole anti-American thing that's happening.
[28:10.220 --> 28:11.420]  People standing on flags.
[28:11.420 --> 28:12.700]  If I see you standing on a flag,
[28:12.700 --> 28:14.020]  I'm running you over in my Prius.
[28:14.020 --> 28:15.300]  I don't give a fuck.
[28:15.300 --> 28:16.460]  That's so ignorant.
[28:16.460 --> 28:17.780]  You wanna know why?
[28:17.780 --> 28:18.620]  This is why.
[28:18.620 --> 28:19.460]  This is why.
[28:19.460 --> 28:22.340]  Because no one is fleeing from America.
[28:22.340 --> 28:24.500]  You are not putting your family on a door
[28:24.500 --> 28:27.260]  and pushing it into the ocean to get somewhere else.
[28:27.260 --> 28:28.420]  America is fine.
[28:29.180 --> 28:30.740]  There's no death raids happening.
[28:30.740 --> 28:32.820]  When it's nighttime, we're in here making a podcast.
[28:32.820 --> 28:34.380]  We're not having one of us make sure
[28:34.380 --> 28:35.820]  that death troopers aren't coming
[28:35.820 --> 28:38.220]  and killing everybody in our fucking village.
[28:38.220 --> 28:39.060]  You know what I'm saying?
[28:39.060 --> 28:42.020]  I hate people that are like, oh, America's horrible.
[28:42.020 --> 28:45.060]  No, you're able to be the person that you want to be
[28:45.060 --> 28:46.220]  because you're in America.
[28:46.220 --> 28:48.100]  Because being yourself in other countries
[28:48.100 --> 28:50.100]  can get you fucking murdered.
[28:50.100 --> 28:51.380]  As shitty as that sounds.
[28:51.380 --> 28:52.820]  This jar of weed, this is probably,
[28:52.820 --> 28:54.380]  what, you think that's about a half ounce?
[28:54.380 --> 28:55.220]  Yeah.
[28:55.220 --> 28:56.580]  A half ounce of weed right here in most countries
[28:56.580 --> 28:58.460]  would probably get your head cut off, bro.
[28:58.460 --> 28:59.300]  You never-
[28:59.300 --> 29:00.140]  In a few.
[29:00.140 --> 29:01.940]  In a few, for sure.
[29:01.940 --> 29:02.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[29:02.860 --> 29:03.700]  A lot of countries.
[29:03.700 --> 29:04.540]  This would be the-
[29:04.540 --> 29:05.420]  Jail time in most.
[29:05.420 --> 29:06.260]  Yeah.
[29:06.260 --> 29:11.260]  We are so free to do, even like-
[29:11.340 --> 29:12.420]  There are a lot of problems.
[29:12.420 --> 29:13.460]  You can't downplay that there are problems.
[29:13.460 --> 29:14.420]  No, no, no, there are.
[29:14.420 --> 29:15.620]  You are absolutely correct.
[29:15.620 --> 29:16.740]  But on the grand scheme of things,
[29:16.740 --> 29:17.580]  he's completely right.
[29:17.580 --> 29:18.780]  No, yeah, we can drive down the street
[29:18.780 --> 29:20.620]  and get 75 different kinds of food.
[29:20.620 --> 29:21.780]  We can drive our own vehicles.
[29:21.780 --> 29:22.620]  We can, we're all-
[29:22.620 --> 29:23.460]  Okay.
[29:23.460 --> 29:24.380]  I bet everybody in this room
[29:24.380 --> 29:26.620]  has varying religious beliefs.
[29:26.620 --> 29:28.140]  And I'm not gonna ask, but we could all-
[29:28.140 --> 29:30.900]  I have every religious tattoo on my hand.
[29:30.900 --> 29:31.740]  Yeah.
[29:31.740 --> 29:32.580]  On one damn hand.
[29:32.580 --> 29:34.580]  But we could all express them by having,
[29:34.580 --> 29:36.620]  I've got a tattoo here, I've got dreadlocks,
[29:36.620 --> 29:38.020]  you've got your symbols there.
[29:38.020 --> 29:39.860]  I think I have a good idea what you follow.
[29:39.860 --> 29:41.220]  And I'm sure you two kind of link up
[29:41.220 --> 29:42.500]  in the same similar sort of way
[29:42.500 --> 29:44.120]  from conversations we've had.
[29:44.120 --> 29:45.860]  But in other countries,
[29:45.860 --> 29:47.860]  one of us would be beheaded for what we all believe in.
[29:47.860 --> 29:49.300]  We'd be fighting to the death right now.
[29:49.300 --> 29:50.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[29:50.140 --> 29:52.380]  Like, ah, Odin!
[29:53.380 --> 29:55.860]  Very, very least, like, spend all day
[29:55.860 --> 29:58.060]  pretending like that wasn't you.
[29:58.060 --> 29:59.060]  Yeah.
[29:59.060 --> 29:59.900]  Like-
[29:59.900 --> 30:01.620]  Yeah, I couldn't have these dreadlocks in a lot of places.
[30:01.620 --> 30:02.580]  Yo, I-
[30:02.580 --> 30:04.740]  A lot of states, not Colorado,
[30:04.740 --> 30:05.900]  you'd get pulled over.
[30:05.900 --> 30:06.740]  I asked you this when we first met.
[30:06.740 --> 30:07.580]  Profiled.
[30:07.580 --> 30:09.020]  At one point, I literally asked you,
[30:09.020 --> 30:11.980]  like, how the fuck do you not get pulled over all the time?
[30:11.980 --> 30:14.300]  And it's because you don't stand out in Colorado anymore,
[30:14.300 --> 30:15.140]  especially not in Buffalo.
[30:15.140 --> 30:18.320]  Yeah, so a lot of the listeners don't realize.
[30:18.320 --> 30:19.580]  I've been told so many times
[30:19.580 --> 30:21.420]  that my voice doesn't match my appearance
[30:21.460 --> 30:23.300]  when people meet me.
[30:23.300 --> 30:25.820]  People, especially when I'm at the store
[30:25.820 --> 30:26.660]  at Green and Healthy Wellness,
[30:26.660 --> 30:28.260]  I'll go in, I buy a lot of product there,
[30:28.260 --> 30:30.860]  and I also deliver products sometimes.
[30:30.860 --> 30:32.940]  But, I don't know if I should have said that.
[30:32.940 --> 30:33.780]  I might edit that shit out.
[30:33.780 --> 30:34.620]  Beep!
[30:34.620 --> 30:35.500]  Man, back to the-
[30:35.500 --> 30:36.940]  I buy a lot of product there.
[30:36.940 --> 30:38.820]  And when I do, sometimes I bump into people
[30:38.820 --> 30:39.900]  that are shopping, and they're like,
[30:39.900 --> 30:40.860]  I recognize that voice.
[30:40.860 --> 30:41.780]  And they turn around and they look at me,
[30:41.780 --> 30:43.780]  and they're not sure if that dreadlock guy
[30:43.780 --> 30:45.060]  is the guy from the podcast.
[30:45.060 --> 30:45.900]  It's really funny.
[30:45.900 --> 30:48.660]  So, the listeners that have never,
[30:48.660 --> 30:50.260]  that aren't privy, I guess,
[30:50.300 --> 30:53.380]  I'm 6'5", and I've got dreadlocks
[30:53.380 --> 30:57.660]  seriously to past my ass, like mid-thigh region,
[30:57.660 --> 30:59.020]  almost to my knees.
[30:59.020 --> 31:00.860]  One of the really longer ones goes almost
[31:00.860 --> 31:02.780]  to my kneecaps by now.
[31:02.780 --> 31:06.660]  So, yeah, I feel pressure from the police sometimes.
[31:06.660 --> 31:08.300]  The cop yesterday asked me, he said,
[31:08.300 --> 31:10.900]  how long did it take you to get those dreadlocks that long?
[31:10.900 --> 31:11.860]  I'm like, 11 years.
[31:11.860 --> 31:13.900]  And he goes, wow, commitment, buddy.
[31:13.900 --> 31:15.340]  I'm like, that's cool.
[31:15.340 --> 31:16.180]  That cop was cool.
[31:16.180 --> 31:18.780]  I was at the courthouse getting fingerprinted
[31:18.780 --> 31:21.460]  for when I worked at a dispensary.
[31:21.460 --> 31:22.860]  Everybody had to go get fingerprinted
[31:22.860 --> 31:24.020]  and had to go take a day off
[31:24.020 --> 31:26.260]  because it took them all fucking day to fingerprint me.
[31:26.260 --> 31:28.500]  But a cop in there walked by and he goes,
[31:28.500 --> 31:30.260]  great dreadlocks, bro.
[31:30.260 --> 31:32.340]  And I was like, that was a cop.
[31:32.340 --> 31:34.940]  Like, that cop complimented my dreadlocks just now.
[31:34.940 --> 31:35.780]  Yeah, and he meant it.
[31:35.780 --> 31:37.060]  He wasn't even being sarcastic.
[31:37.060 --> 31:39.660]  He was like, had a smile on his face and shit.
[31:39.660 --> 31:41.300]  So, not all cops are cocks.
[31:41.300 --> 31:43.820]  Some cops are cool, but yeah, and I'm a freak,
[31:43.820 --> 31:47.100]  and so sometimes I do feel some pressure from the police.
[31:47.100 --> 31:48.500]  I think all that America stuff,
[31:48.500 --> 31:50.620]  time is it good with the police?
[31:50.620 --> 31:52.860]  Because that's just a big thing going on now.
[31:53.900 --> 31:57.260]  Man, I could really just go on about America, man.
[31:57.260 --> 31:59.180]  Social media warriors and stuff.
[31:59.180 --> 32:01.900]  People who are just bitching about the world.
[32:01.900 --> 32:04.580]  I think that what we were just talking about earlier,
[32:04.580 --> 32:08.100]  like how public executions and all that stuff.
[32:08.100 --> 32:10.740]  I think that for one hour out of the week.
[32:10.740 --> 32:11.620]  Were we talking about that?
[32:11.620 --> 32:12.900]  Yeah, we were talking about other countries
[32:12.900 --> 32:13.740]  being fucked up.
[32:13.740 --> 32:16.580]  Yeah, Mike gave me a look of like, really?
[32:17.220 --> 32:18.060]  No, I followed.
[32:18.060 --> 32:20.980]  It was just, we're all high and this is awesome.
[32:20.980 --> 32:21.820]  Sharp left.
[32:21.820 --> 32:24.420]  This conversation is brought to you by marijuana.
[32:24.420 --> 32:26.940]  Brought to you by marijuana.
[32:26.940 --> 32:30.220]  I think that everybody should be made to watch
[32:30.220 --> 32:33.060]  one hour of what's really going on in other countries.
[32:33.060 --> 32:33.900]  Like a week.
[32:33.900 --> 32:36.820]  One hour a week of like, show me what's up in Mexico.
[32:36.820 --> 32:38.580]  Show me what's up in Egypt.
[32:38.580 --> 32:40.220]  Show you what's really fucked up,
[32:40.220 --> 32:43.220]  because people really think we have it bad here.
[32:43.220 --> 32:44.060]  That would be a great idea,
[32:44.060 --> 32:44.900]  but I think it's all about the source.
[32:44.900 --> 32:46.460]  Where are you gonna get that material?
[32:47.340 --> 32:48.420]  The fucking internet has all of it.
[32:48.420 --> 32:52.580]  It has people being publicly executed by the-
[32:52.580 --> 32:54.060]  But does it have the good also?
[32:54.060 --> 32:56.100]  Does it have the good as well as the bad?
[32:56.100 --> 32:57.140]  Well, yeah, no, no, no, no.
[32:57.140 --> 32:59.780]  What I'm saying is, I was just referencing
[32:59.780 --> 33:03.140]  to the fact that people bitch about America so much.
[33:03.140 --> 33:05.380]  We are really okay here.
[33:07.180 --> 33:08.140]  I just went to Cali.
[33:08.140 --> 33:09.060]  Cali was awesome.
[33:09.060 --> 33:10.220]  First time ever in Cali.
[33:10.220 --> 33:11.060]  Amazing.
[33:11.060 --> 33:11.900]  Shout out to Cali.
[33:13.580 --> 33:15.140]  I think someone liked Cali.
[33:15.140 --> 33:17.980]  But I got into a debate with my friend there,
[33:17.980 --> 33:20.700]  because she's an active feminist and stuff,
[33:20.700 --> 33:21.540]  which I support.
[33:21.540 --> 33:22.460]  That's awesome.
[33:22.460 --> 33:25.420]  But she said that women don't have a lot of rights here,
[33:25.420 --> 33:28.100]  and they're really restrained, and so on and so forth,
[33:28.100 --> 33:30.380]  which in some ways, I do see statistically,
[33:30.380 --> 33:31.380]  they get paid less and stuff.
[33:31.380 --> 33:32.340]  I understand.
[33:32.340 --> 33:34.820]  But as far as freedoms of the world,
[33:34.820 --> 33:36.580]  women are really free in America.
[33:37.900 --> 33:40.100]  I hate to say it, but in other countries,
[33:40.100 --> 33:42.620]  women are still getting stoned to death
[33:42.620 --> 33:44.820]  for talking to males in public.
[33:45.500 --> 33:47.300]  And we got women running for president.
[33:47.300 --> 33:48.420]  Yes, things are different,
[33:48.420 --> 33:52.700]  but we are farly advanced in a lot of ways.
[33:52.700 --> 33:55.620]  I don't know if that sounds weird to say, but like.
[33:55.620 --> 33:57.580]  How can people find you on Twitter?
[33:57.580 --> 33:59.580]  Sloppy919.
[33:59.580 --> 34:01.020]  Angry tweet me if you want to.
[34:01.020 --> 34:02.260]  I wanna hear everything.
[34:02.260 --> 34:05.580]  Make sure all of the tweets about the anti-feminism
[34:05.580 --> 34:07.380]  statements are headed towards Sloppy.
[34:07.380 --> 34:08.220]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[34:08.220 --> 34:09.940]  I didn't say anything about anti.
[34:09.940 --> 34:12.260]  I've said I'm totally for it.
[34:12.260 --> 34:14.660]  There were some microaggressions.
[34:15.500 --> 34:18.260]  No, I feel like it was just a statement.
[34:18.260 --> 34:20.620]  You almost swallowed your whole blunt
[34:20.620 --> 34:22.460]  when I said the word microaggression.
[34:22.460 --> 34:23.580]  Yes, it was funny.
[34:23.580 --> 34:25.580]  That's a new word for this generation.
[34:25.580 --> 34:26.860]  Stand up for whoever you are.
[34:26.860 --> 34:28.860]  I believe in all, like.
[34:28.860 --> 34:30.980]  I also think that, I think it's fucked up
[34:30.980 --> 34:34.900]  that it's fucked up to be proud of your heritage nowadays.
[34:34.900 --> 34:37.740]  Like, nobody really does it.
[34:37.740 --> 34:40.140]  Nobody's like, I'm Italian and da, da, da, da.
[34:40.140 --> 34:41.460]  Like, nobody's with their roots.
[34:41.460 --> 34:44.460]  Nobody wants to be guilty of cultural appropriation.
[34:45.420 --> 34:47.140]  It's a step away from being racist.
[34:47.140 --> 34:50.820]  It's almost, it's a foot into the racist category,
[34:50.820 --> 34:51.940]  which it isn't.
[34:51.940 --> 34:54.300]  But then again, racism isn't it just having
[34:54.300 --> 34:55.380]  pride in one's race?
[34:55.380 --> 34:57.660]  Isn't bigotry the real problem?
[34:57.660 --> 34:59.580]  Like, or something like that?
[34:59.580 --> 35:02.100]  Because like, I feel like it's a thin,
[35:02.100 --> 35:04.140]  like it shouldn't be a thin line.
[35:04.140 --> 35:06.140]  Like, everybody should be proud of who they are.
[35:06.140 --> 35:08.500]  Like, if you're German, be proud you're German.
[35:08.500 --> 35:09.820]  If you're black, be proud you're black.
[35:09.820 --> 35:12.300]  If you're Asian, be, you know what I'm saying?
[35:12.380 --> 35:14.460]  But it's when you add hate to it.
[35:14.460 --> 35:16.020]  Like, oh, I don't like these other people
[35:16.020 --> 35:18.460]  because they're not this, that it becomes a problem.
[35:18.460 --> 35:21.660]  But I think that it's misinterpreted a lot.
[35:21.660 --> 35:24.820]  Like, people just see what they want to see.
[35:24.820 --> 35:26.620]  Like, straight up, you could take any story
[35:26.620 --> 35:30.900]  and make it good or bad by changing like minor details,
[35:30.900 --> 35:31.860]  altering shit.
[35:32.820 --> 35:34.020]  I've seen them do it.
[35:35.820 --> 35:37.060]  Two people can read the same book
[35:37.060 --> 35:38.700]  and get totally different stories.
[35:38.700 --> 35:40.620]  Two people can watch the same car accident
[35:40.660 --> 35:42.380]  and tell two totally different stories.
[35:42.380 --> 35:44.380]  Perspective is a damn thing.
[35:44.380 --> 35:46.700]  Yep, and watch the same fight,
[35:46.700 --> 35:48.180]  have two totally different stories.
[35:48.180 --> 35:49.180]  Both people won.
[35:50.300 --> 35:51.900]  Yeah, you're gonna tell it.
[35:51.900 --> 35:53.260]  Mike beat the shit out of Jeff
[35:53.260 --> 35:54.860]  and you'll be like, Jeff beat the shit out of Mike.
[35:54.860 --> 35:55.820]  He was stomping him.
[35:55.820 --> 35:57.380]  You'll be like, no, Mike had him the whole time.
[35:57.380 --> 35:58.340]  I've heard stuff like that.
[35:58.340 --> 36:00.300]  Like, back in school shit, like both people won.
[36:00.300 --> 36:01.620]  I'm like, well, who won then?
[36:01.620 --> 36:05.900]  Y'all just like, everybody is hulking Superman here.
[36:05.900 --> 36:08.220]  All right, guys, we got way off course here, but I like it.
[36:08.220 --> 36:09.060]  No, I like it, it's fun.
[36:09.220 --> 36:10.620]  We put up the America stuff.
[36:10.620 --> 36:11.700]  I tried to squeeze it in.
[36:11.700 --> 36:12.540]  America, fuck yeah.
[36:12.540 --> 36:13.820]  They like it when we ramble.
[36:13.820 --> 36:16.100]  They do, hashtag, I like it when you ramble.
[36:17.820 --> 36:20.180]  So, talking about what to do
[36:20.180 --> 36:21.940]  if you get pulled over by the police.
[36:21.940 --> 36:23.300]  Guys, behave yourselves.
[36:23.300 --> 36:24.300]  Don't reach too quickly.
[36:24.300 --> 36:25.260]  We all saw the video of the guy
[36:25.260 --> 36:26.900]  that reached into his car to get his ID
[36:26.900 --> 36:28.500]  and got blasted by the police.
[36:28.500 --> 36:29.340]  Jesus.
[36:29.340 --> 36:30.860]  Don't reach so quickly, just chill out.
[36:30.860 --> 36:31.700]  Ask him.
[36:31.700 --> 36:32.540]  Chill out, chill out.
[36:32.540 --> 36:34.100]  Try to get a good recording.
[36:34.100 --> 36:36.100]  Whoever said that is a genius.
[36:36.100 --> 36:37.900]  Slop, high five since you got your hand up.
[36:38.100 --> 36:39.140]  High five you, there you go.
[36:39.140 --> 36:40.540]  High five on a record it.
[36:40.540 --> 36:42.900]  All right, so how about if we're sitting here.
[36:44.820 --> 36:48.460]  Mike, I'm gonna ask you, let's go Mike first.
[36:48.460 --> 36:49.500]  This is your house.
[36:49.500 --> 36:50.500]  Let's say I just gave you the house.
[36:50.500 --> 36:52.900]  We're sitting here, doorbell rings,
[36:52.900 --> 36:54.620]  and not even doorbell, it's this one.
[36:54.620 --> 36:55.860]  It's fucking this sound.
[36:55.860 --> 36:56.700]  It's a pounding.
[36:57.780 --> 36:58.620]  The cop knocked.
[36:58.620 --> 37:00.060]  Are we all, everybody's heart sinks
[37:00.060 --> 37:01.340]  when you hear that shit.
[37:01.340 --> 37:02.660]  Pizza.
[37:02.660 --> 37:04.140]  If you're Pizza Boy, it's not like that.
[37:04.140 --> 37:04.980]  Fuck it.
[37:04.980 --> 37:05.820]  Right?
[37:05.820 --> 37:06.660]  Like, don't take the pizza.
[37:06.700 --> 37:07.540]  I don't know how cops knock like that.
[37:07.540 --> 37:09.460]  Yeah, and we all know right away,
[37:09.460 --> 37:11.860]  like, oh, shit, it's the police.
[37:11.860 --> 37:12.700]  What are you gonna do?
[37:12.700 --> 37:13.540]  How do you handle that?
[37:15.500 --> 37:17.620]  Take a quick look around the room
[37:17.620 --> 37:19.540]  and make sure there's nothing laying there
[37:19.540 --> 37:21.460]  that I wouldn't want laying out.
[37:21.460 --> 37:23.820]  That's just a habit from back when weed was illegal here.
[37:23.820 --> 37:24.980]  Right, and that's a good tip for anybody
[37:24.980 --> 37:26.340]  that's not in Colorado.
[37:26.340 --> 37:28.140]  I shouldn't have knocked so hard on the fucking table.
[37:28.140 --> 37:29.660]  That was ridiculous.
[37:29.660 --> 37:32.100]  I don't know how cops knock like that repeatedly.
[37:32.100 --> 37:34.300]  Like, is that why they're annoyed when I open the door?
[37:34.300 --> 37:35.140]  Because their fucking hand.
[37:35.180 --> 37:36.900]  Rubbing their hand on their jeans all like,
[37:36.900 --> 37:37.860]  fuck, this sucks.
[37:37.860 --> 37:39.140]  I broke my knuckle.
[37:39.140 --> 37:40.660]  Right?
[37:40.660 --> 37:42.500]  So, open the door.
[37:43.460 --> 37:45.020]  Good evening, officer.
[37:45.020 --> 37:46.180]  What can I do for you?
[37:47.700 --> 37:51.180]  And then see what they've got to say at that point.
[37:51.180 --> 37:53.100]  Like, nine times out of 10,
[37:53.100 --> 37:54.980]  if they were there and you were in real trouble,
[37:54.980 --> 37:56.540]  they would have knocked.
[37:56.540 --> 37:57.940]  Like, your door would have exploded.
[37:57.940 --> 37:59.340]  A flashback would have gone off
[37:59.340 --> 38:01.540]  and you'd have an M16 pointed at your head.
[38:01.860 --> 38:06.180]  Um, if they're knocking, they just want to ask questions.
[38:06.180 --> 38:08.940]  And so, just, if you're not interested,
[38:08.940 --> 38:11.580]  say you're not interested, come back with a warrant
[38:11.580 --> 38:14.700]  and politely end the conversation and step back inside.
[38:15.980 --> 38:17.460]  If they're like, asking about something
[38:17.460 --> 38:18.660]  that happened up the street or whatever
[38:18.660 --> 38:19.500]  and you want to talk to them,
[38:19.500 --> 38:22.540]  step out onto the porch and pull the door shut behind you.
[38:24.060 --> 38:26.180]  Sit there and have the conversation.
[38:26.180 --> 38:28.020]  Should you almost lock yourself out?
[38:29.060 --> 38:30.260]  Unnecessary.
[38:30.260 --> 38:31.100]  All right.
[38:31.660 --> 38:33.820]  And open the door and go in for any reason?
[38:33.820 --> 38:34.860]  Not legally.
[38:34.860 --> 38:37.820]  We're at a warrant, like, without probable cause
[38:37.820 --> 38:39.820]  that there's a crime being committed inside
[38:39.820 --> 38:41.500]  or that somebody's in distress.
[38:41.500 --> 38:43.420]  So, what if the cop says,
[38:43.420 --> 38:47.300]  well, Mike, I'd like to take a look inside.
[38:47.300 --> 38:48.140]  Why?
[38:49.260 --> 38:52.180]  Because we believe you did it.
[38:52.180 --> 38:53.020]  Did what?
[38:53.020 --> 38:55.780]  The thing that we're here to accuse you of.
[38:55.780 --> 38:57.860]  No, come back with a warrant.
[38:57.860 --> 38:59.460]  I'd like to look inside, Mike.
[38:59.500 --> 39:01.700]  I'd like to go inside and shut the door
[39:01.700 --> 39:03.180]  and continue on with my evening officer.
[39:03.180 --> 39:04.020]  If you don't have a warrant,
[39:04.020 --> 39:05.260]  please come back later with one.
[39:05.260 --> 39:06.980]  If you don't have anything to hide, Mike,
[39:06.980 --> 39:08.740]  there shouldn't be a problem with us coming in
[39:08.740 --> 39:10.060]  and taking a look, don't you think?
[39:10.060 --> 39:10.900]  I got stuff to do.
[39:10.900 --> 39:11.740]  Have a nice night.
[39:11.740 --> 39:12.700]  Come back with a warrant.
[39:12.700 --> 39:14.660]  All right, Mike, thanks for playing along.
[39:14.660 --> 39:15.820]  You fucking win.
[39:15.820 --> 39:17.060]  Would you like a dab?
[39:17.060 --> 39:18.460]  Like, it's a lot scarier.
[39:18.460 --> 39:19.700]  No, I'm serious now.
[39:19.700 --> 39:20.540]  Would you like a dab?
[39:20.540 --> 39:21.380]  What's your badge number?
[39:21.380 --> 39:22.500]  A really small one.
[39:22.500 --> 39:24.300]  Because you won, you played that perfectly.
[39:24.300 --> 39:25.940]  All the right answers over there.
[39:26.140 --> 39:28.700]  It's, you've got a lot of rights
[39:28.700 --> 39:31.460]  and knowing how to exercise them is key.
[39:32.420 --> 39:37.420]  Grab a pen or type flexyourrights.com, I think it is.
[39:37.860 --> 39:39.380]  Or just Google Flex Your Rights.
[39:39.380 --> 39:41.940]  It's a series of videos put on by a defense attorney
[39:41.940 --> 39:46.180]  out of Baltimore, who's really fun to watch on video.
[39:46.180 --> 39:48.260]  And it's really nice to know exactly what to do
[39:48.260 --> 39:49.940]  when you run into law enforcement.
[39:49.940 --> 39:50.780]  Google Flex Your Rights.
[39:50.780 --> 39:52.180]  Flex Your Rights.
[39:52.180 --> 39:53.380]  Flex Your Rights, cool.
[39:53.380 --> 39:54.980]  Oh, we should have gone there before we did this.
[39:54.980 --> 39:55.860]  We should have read that.
[39:55.860 --> 39:56.700]  Right?
[39:57.380 --> 39:58.620]  It's awesome.
[39:58.620 --> 40:00.180]  I meant to review it before I came over,
[40:00.180 --> 40:01.380]  but I got to kid now.
[40:01.380 --> 40:02.740]  I had to.
[40:02.740 --> 40:03.900]  Try not to, yeah, there you go.
[40:03.900 --> 40:04.740]  Don't dab the microphone.
[40:04.740 --> 40:05.820]  Don't dab the microphone.
[40:05.820 --> 40:07.500]  Yo, so I read something the other day
[40:07.500 --> 40:10.220]  that says that undercover vehicles
[40:10.220 --> 40:14.740]  cannot operate normal traffic stops in Colorado.
[40:14.740 --> 40:16.420]  Do you know if that's true or not?
[40:16.420 --> 40:19.980]  I saw a Chevy Tahoe-ish looking vehicle.
[40:19.980 --> 40:21.820]  I don't want to be certain on the Tahoe.
[40:21.820 --> 40:23.700]  It looked like a Tahoe.
[40:23.700 --> 40:25.980]  I pulled somebody over on I-25 the other day
[40:25.980 --> 40:27.020]  while I was in Denver.
[40:27.020 --> 40:27.860]  Yeah?
[40:27.860 --> 40:28.700]  Yeah.
[40:28.700 --> 40:30.860]  I have somebody who works at the Honda dealership
[40:30.860 --> 40:33.020]  that said that he got pulled over by undercover
[40:33.020 --> 40:35.980]  and they said, you don't have insurance.
[40:35.980 --> 40:39.180]  And he said, you're not supposed to be pulling people over
[40:39.180 --> 40:40.700]  in this vehicle and they let him go.
[40:40.700 --> 40:44.100]  But I don't never believe 100% what people say.
[40:44.100 --> 40:45.140]  So I was trying to.
[40:45.140 --> 40:47.260]  And he was a car dealer?
[40:47.260 --> 40:48.620]  No, he's a mechanic.
[40:48.620 --> 40:49.980]  Okay, I was going to say, if he's a car dealer,
[40:49.980 --> 40:51.700]  he already loses a little bit of credibility.
[40:51.700 --> 40:52.540]  No, no, no, mechanic.
[40:52.540 --> 40:54.300]  You want me to turn your mic up over there, Mike?
[40:54.300 --> 40:55.140]  Hmm.
[40:55.140 --> 40:55.980]  Yeah.
[40:55.980 --> 40:59.060]  Just going to let him die right on my,
[40:59.060 --> 41:01.140]  take your baby dab.
[41:01.140 --> 41:01.980]  Baby lungs.
[41:01.980 --> 41:02.820]  Mike, don't smoke cigarettes.
[41:02.820 --> 41:04.060]  You guys are, you'll end up sounding like that.
[41:04.060 --> 41:06.180]  That's exactly what that is.
[41:06.180 --> 41:07.020]  Two cigarettes.
[41:07.020 --> 41:08.700]  We're going to have an intervention.
[41:08.700 --> 41:10.660]  One day we're going to tell him we're having a podcast
[41:10.660 --> 41:12.660]  and this is going to be an intervention.
[41:14.180 --> 41:15.420]  The fuck we were just talking about.
[41:15.420 --> 41:17.260]  I was making a tribute and then I coughed it right out of my mouth.
[41:17.260 --> 41:18.100]  I'm going to quiz Sloppy.
[41:18.100 --> 41:19.140]  Sloppy, all right, here we go.
[41:19.140 --> 41:20.940]  We're at your house.
[41:20.940 --> 41:21.780]  It's the cops.
[41:21.820 --> 41:22.660]  I'm going to open the door.
[41:22.660 --> 41:23.500]  No, no, no.
[41:23.500 --> 41:25.660]  First thing I do, first thing I do,
[41:25.660 --> 41:26.900]  because I'm a pet owner,
[41:26.900 --> 41:29.860]  I'm putting my dog somewhere where they can't act aggressive
[41:29.860 --> 41:33.100]  towards the police because fuck that.
[41:33.100 --> 41:33.940]  Like straight up.
[41:33.940 --> 41:34.780]  They will shoot your fucking dog.
[41:34.780 --> 41:38.140]  Yeah, and honestly, like not trying to sound like crazy
[41:38.140 --> 41:39.900]  or nothing, but if they shoot my dogs in front of me,
[41:39.900 --> 41:42.540]  I'm catching some charges because I'm swinging no regrets.
[41:42.540 --> 41:43.380]  Like no doubt.
[41:43.380 --> 41:46.260]  Yo, I am beast moding that.
[41:46.260 --> 41:48.140]  Your dogs look fucking scary as shit.
[41:48.140 --> 41:50.620]  And they're so lovable, but they're 90 pounds of pit bulls.
[41:50.620 --> 41:52.020]  So I understand like,
[41:52.020 --> 41:54.060]  sometimes I forget that they're like that.
[41:54.060 --> 41:55.140]  Cause people are like, oh my God.
[41:55.140 --> 41:56.060]  And I'm like, what?
[41:56.060 --> 41:57.060]  Get in their face, bro.
[41:57.060 --> 41:57.900]  You're good.
[41:57.900 --> 41:58.740]  I cuddle with those dogs.
[41:58.740 --> 42:00.980]  They sleep in my bed every night.
[42:00.980 --> 42:02.660]  But yeah, no, I'm putting my dogs up
[42:02.660 --> 42:06.140]  and then I'm going to answer the door.
[42:06.140 --> 42:08.460]  As soon as I see that it's the authorities,
[42:08.460 --> 42:10.340]  I am stepping out and closing the door.
[42:10.340 --> 42:13.060]  Like when you said that, that's exactly,
[42:13.060 --> 42:14.900]  I don't want them looking in my house.
[42:14.900 --> 42:16.260]  I don't want them to have a reason like,
[42:16.260 --> 42:17.100]  oh, I saw this on the table.
[42:17.100 --> 42:18.300]  That's why you step out and shut the door.
[42:18.420 --> 42:20.660]  So that while one of them talks to you,
[42:20.660 --> 42:23.820]  the other one searches as much of your house as he can.
[42:23.820 --> 42:24.660]  Be lurking around.
[42:24.660 --> 42:26.420]  Oh, there's a grinder on the table or so.
[42:26.420 --> 42:27.460]  I don't want none of that shit.
[42:27.460 --> 42:28.620]  Get out, shut the door.
[42:28.620 --> 42:29.660]  Why are you here?
[42:30.540 --> 42:31.580]  Always be polite.
[42:31.580 --> 42:32.940]  Eye contact.
[42:33.780 --> 42:34.700]  I guess, yeah, be loving.
[42:34.700 --> 42:35.940]  Hands out of your pockets.
[42:35.940 --> 42:37.140]  Yeah, for sure.
[42:37.140 --> 42:39.020]  That's a key.
[42:39.020 --> 42:41.020]  Don't have your hands in your pocket.
[42:41.020 --> 42:41.860]  All right, Sloppy.
[42:41.860 --> 42:43.380]  Here's the ultimate question.
[42:43.380 --> 42:46.740]  Well, Mr. Sloppy, I'd like to come inside and take a look.
[42:46.740 --> 42:47.780]  Why?
[42:48.340 --> 42:50.260]  I want to make sure you didn't do it.
[42:51.700 --> 42:54.820]  I really don't know what you're talking about.
[42:54.820 --> 42:57.180]  You did the crime that we're here to invent.
[42:57.180 --> 42:59.540]  That we're here to invent.
[42:59.540 --> 43:00.380]  I mean, that's you.
[43:00.380 --> 43:01.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[43:01.220 --> 43:03.620]  You know, that's how it feels most of the time.
[43:03.620 --> 43:05.500]  Nah, yeah, if they don't have a warrant,
[43:05.500 --> 43:07.180]  don't let them do anything.
[43:07.180 --> 43:09.180]  Don't let them fucking in your house.
[43:09.180 --> 43:13.300]  Yeah, and honestly, from past experience,
[43:13.300 --> 43:15.060]  even if they have a warrant,
[43:15.060 --> 43:16.580]  they're gonna do whatever the fuck they want
[43:16.580 --> 43:19.300]  because the one time I was arrested
[43:19.300 --> 43:20.980]  was this exact scenario.
[43:20.980 --> 43:21.860]  Well, not exact.
[43:21.860 --> 43:23.700]  I stepped out of the house.
[43:23.700 --> 43:25.580]  I went to the gas station to get a Dutch.
[43:25.580 --> 43:27.060]  I was with my friend Julian.
[43:27.060 --> 43:27.900]  I think I've told this story.
[43:27.900 --> 43:28.740]  Shout out to Julian.
[43:28.740 --> 43:30.260]  Yeah, yeah, shout out to Killer Jules.
[43:30.260 --> 43:32.380]  And see, he makes beats.
[43:32.380 --> 43:33.220]  Dead God.
[43:34.620 --> 43:36.500]  But no, I think I've told this story on the cast before.
[43:36.500 --> 43:38.460]  We pulled up to the gas station.
[43:38.460 --> 43:39.980]  It's like half a mile from the house
[43:39.980 --> 43:43.140]  and mad cops swarm the car and get out.
[43:43.140 --> 43:46.180]  And they're like full tactical gear and stuff.
[43:46.620 --> 43:48.220]  And they're yelling at Julian.
[43:48.220 --> 43:50.060]  And I was like, oh, mistaken identity.
[43:50.060 --> 43:51.300]  I literally thought that.
[43:51.300 --> 43:53.420]  And then they looked at me and said my government name.
[43:53.420 --> 43:55.500]  And they had the warrant.
[43:55.500 --> 43:56.540]  They showed me the warrant.
[43:56.540 --> 43:57.380]  I read it.
[43:57.380 --> 43:58.220]  I was in handcuffs.
[43:58.220 --> 43:59.420]  I looked through it.
[43:59.420 --> 44:01.180]  I lived in a third story apartment,
[44:01.180 --> 44:02.340]  one way in, one way out.
[44:02.340 --> 44:03.860]  Told them the door was unlocked.
[44:03.860 --> 44:06.020]  Said my girlfriend's in there with my dog.
[44:06.020 --> 44:07.660]  Go ahead, just go in.
[44:07.660 --> 44:08.860]  You already have all the paperwork.
[44:08.860 --> 44:09.820]  It's cool.
[44:09.820 --> 44:12.780]  They went up there and still busted out every window,
[44:12.780 --> 44:14.180]  flash banged my girlfriend,
[44:14.220 --> 44:16.500]  hazered the dog and knocked the door in.
[44:16.500 --> 44:18.460]  And I told them where everything was
[44:18.460 --> 44:21.620]  and they cut my cushions open, broke my fridge.
[44:21.620 --> 44:24.180]  They found half a gram of marijuana,
[44:24.180 --> 44:26.420]  a bong and an unregistered firearm.
[44:26.420 --> 44:27.540]  I wasn't 21 yet.
[44:27.540 --> 44:29.580]  I was three months away.
[44:29.580 --> 44:30.420]  And that was it.
[44:30.420 --> 44:32.300]  And I told them the door was unlocked to go inside
[44:32.300 --> 44:34.580]  and they still blew that shit up.
[44:35.980 --> 44:38.860]  Yeah, so if they have the warrant, fuck you.
[44:38.860 --> 44:40.220]  If they don't have the warrant,
[44:40.220 --> 44:42.140]  get the fuck out of my face.
[44:42.140 --> 44:42.980]  Leave me alone.
[44:43.020 --> 44:43.860]  If they've got the warrant,
[44:43.860 --> 44:44.940]  they're pretty much doing what they wanted to.
[44:44.940 --> 44:46.020]  They didn't knock anyway.
[44:46.020 --> 44:48.140]  They booted in that fucking door.
[44:48.140 --> 44:50.500]  What it was was they planned on doing that to me anyway.
[44:50.500 --> 44:51.740]  And then I went to the store and he was like,
[44:51.740 --> 44:53.380]  oh, he took all the fun out of it.
[44:53.380 --> 44:54.220]  Fuck it.
[44:54.220 --> 44:56.900]  Yeah, we had all of our toys polished.
[44:56.900 --> 44:58.780]  We wanted to come play with our toys.
[44:58.780 --> 45:01.580]  All right, so we all know what to do now.
[45:01.580 --> 45:03.540]  If the cops come to the door, step outside,
[45:03.540 --> 45:07.380]  talk to them, be kind, keep your hands where they can see them.
[45:07.380 --> 45:11.660]  If a cop asks for your ID, you do not have to present ID,
[45:11.700 --> 45:13.100]  but it helps with the interaction.
[45:13.100 --> 45:14.620]  If you want to keep on that polite,
[45:14.620 --> 45:16.820]  like I don't want to go to jail side,
[45:16.820 --> 45:17.860]  just give me your fucking ID.
[45:17.860 --> 45:19.260]  If you're not hiding anything,
[45:19.260 --> 45:20.660]  you can flex your rights and be like,
[45:20.660 --> 45:22.180]  I don't have to give you my ID.
[45:22.180 --> 45:25.140]  But it's just kind of being a dick.
[45:25.140 --> 45:27.140]  There are a lot of YouTube videos
[45:27.140 --> 45:29.980]  where you can really learn your rights.
[45:29.980 --> 45:32.860]  And some people really enjoy pulling the,
[45:32.860 --> 45:36.660]  am I detained, am I free to go, just rapid fire.
[45:36.660 --> 45:37.500]  That's where I'm headed with this.
[45:37.500 --> 45:39.780]  There are YouTube channels that are solely dedicated
[45:39.860 --> 45:42.020]  to people harassing police officers.
[45:42.020 --> 45:44.460]  Yeah, walking down the street with assault rifles
[45:44.460 --> 45:46.020]  just to get a rile out of the police.
[45:46.020 --> 45:46.900]  You're like, sir, what are you doing?
[45:46.900 --> 45:51.900]  I can be here because of HB 417 paragraph.
[45:52.260 --> 45:54.180]  Me and my nunchucks and samurai sword
[45:54.180 --> 45:57.300]  and butt ass naked are fairly legal right now.
[45:57.300 --> 45:59.380]  Well, no, depending on where you live in the US,
[45:59.380 --> 46:04.380]  like along our Southern states, anything bordering Mexico,
[46:05.220 --> 46:07.300]  they've got random highway checkpoints
[46:07.340 --> 46:09.860]  where they look for immigration documents
[46:09.860 --> 46:11.620]  and all kinds of shit.
[46:11.620 --> 46:13.980]  And a lot of that's unconstitutional
[46:13.980 --> 46:16.540]  and it really pisses people off.
[46:16.540 --> 46:20.620]  And so people who know exactly how to flex their rights
[46:20.620 --> 46:22.660]  in a very specific way,
[46:22.660 --> 46:25.580]  risk giving the living shit beaten out of them
[46:25.580 --> 46:28.180]  and thrown in jail and go flex their rights
[46:28.180 --> 46:32.380]  at fucking massive checkpoints and stuff and it's nuts.
[46:32.380 --> 46:35.780]  But knowing exactly how to do that
[46:35.780 --> 46:38.940]  makes getting pulled over really easy to handle.
[46:38.940 --> 46:42.620]  Like you stay calm and keep your hands in plain sight.
[46:42.620 --> 46:44.500]  You ask him to get your info out of the glove box.
[46:44.500 --> 46:46.020]  What if you're walking down the street?
[46:46.020 --> 46:48.780]  What if you're just down on fucking fourth street
[46:48.780 --> 46:50.420]  walking from one store to the other
[46:50.420 --> 46:51.860]  and it's kind of fucking dark out
[46:51.860 --> 46:53.020]  and the cop walks up to you and he's like,
[46:53.020 --> 46:54.700]  hey you come here, I wanna talk to you.
[46:54.700 --> 46:56.460]  A cop just walks out of nowhere
[46:56.460 --> 46:58.420]  or he comes from somewhere specific.
[46:59.700 --> 47:01.300]  There's a manhole.
[47:01.300 --> 47:02.140]  Rapist.
[47:02.140 --> 47:02.980]  He's a rapist.
[47:03.940 --> 47:05.860]  The manhole smoothly slid over
[47:05.860 --> 47:08.260]  and the cop elevated slowly out of it.
[47:09.660 --> 47:10.900]  No, that man's the devil.
[47:13.460 --> 47:14.580]  Or a ninja turtle.
[47:16.860 --> 47:17.740]  You don't know where he came from.
[47:17.740 --> 47:20.100]  You're in conversation, you and I were talking.
[47:21.060 --> 47:22.300]  Cop pops up, bumps into us.
[47:22.300 --> 47:24.700]  Excuse me boys, I'd like to talk to you.
[47:24.700 --> 47:26.340]  How can I help you officer?
[47:26.340 --> 47:27.500]  Hey, what's up sir, what's going on?
[47:27.500 --> 47:28.660]  I'd like to see your ID.
[47:28.660 --> 47:30.820]  You reach in your pocket, hand him your ID?
[47:30.820 --> 47:31.660]  Yeah, sure.
[47:31.700 --> 47:33.420]  How am I, nope, sure.
[47:33.420 --> 47:34.500]  If I'm just standing there
[47:34.500 --> 47:35.340]  and it's not harassing me or anything?
[47:35.340 --> 47:37.460]  How I answer that question depends
[47:37.460 --> 47:39.660]  what other items are on my person.
[47:39.660 --> 47:41.260]  I was just about to say that.
[47:41.260 --> 47:42.940]  Well, that's where I'm headed next.
[47:42.940 --> 47:44.700]  Looks like you guys, we saw you guys
[47:44.700 --> 47:46.620]  smoking some weed back there when you were walking.
[47:46.620 --> 47:47.460]  No you didn't.
[47:49.260 --> 47:52.860]  I saw you and you fucking reek like weed.
[47:52.860 --> 47:55.100]  That's an opinion, not a fact sir.
[47:55.100 --> 47:56.300]  Okay, I like the way you're going with this.
[47:56.300 --> 47:57.900]  That would probably get me hit with a stick.
[47:57.900 --> 47:58.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:58.740 --> 47:59.580]  That's what I was gonna say.
[47:59.580 --> 48:01.500]  I know I'm gonna mace you, tase you
[48:01.500 --> 48:03.140]  and hit you with something and then put you in the car.
[48:03.140 --> 48:04.180]  That's my perfume.
[48:04.180 --> 48:06.300]  That was the one and only benefit ever
[48:06.300 --> 48:09.980]  to smoking cigarettes is that's what I always smelled like.
[48:09.980 --> 48:13.140]  And I could like point to the cigarettes in my pocket
[48:13.140 --> 48:15.140]  and be like, no sir, Marlboro.
[48:15.140 --> 48:16.420]  And they'd go, oh.
[48:17.540 --> 48:20.180]  And then the line of questioning would change like instantly.
[48:20.180 --> 48:22.820]  All right, so when does the,
[48:24.300 --> 48:26.940]  I wanna search your pockets Mike.
[48:26.940 --> 48:28.940]  I think you're the guy smoking weed over there.
[48:29.260 --> 48:30.740]  I don't consent to any search.
[48:30.740 --> 48:32.820]  I feel like I need to search you Mike.
[48:32.820 --> 48:35.780]  I don't consent to any searches sir, am I being detained?
[48:36.900 --> 48:39.900]  I don't have any grounds to detain you so.
[48:39.900 --> 48:42.300]  Have a good evening officer, am I free to go?
[48:44.260 --> 48:45.380]  Can I run your name first?
[48:45.380 --> 48:46.220]  Am I free to go?
[48:46.220 --> 48:47.780]  I'd like to run your name and then I'll let you go.
[48:47.780 --> 48:48.620]  Am I being detained?
[48:48.620 --> 48:51.180]  You can go cause you're an asshole and you know you're right.
[48:51.180 --> 48:52.020]  It's hard to.
[48:52.020 --> 48:54.980]  Just stay really calm and like if you're screaming,
[48:54.980 --> 48:56.300]  am I being detained?
[48:57.260 --> 49:00.500]  The answer is gonna be yes, get on the ground.
[49:00.500 --> 49:02.980]  But if you just calmly, I'm sorry sir,
[49:02.980 --> 49:05.900]  I have somewhere to be, am I being detained?
[49:05.900 --> 49:09.220]  I'm not being detained sir, I'd like to go, am I free to go?
[49:09.220 --> 49:11.020]  Thank you officer, have a good night.
[49:11.020 --> 49:13.420]  You know, good luck investigating whatever it is
[49:13.420 --> 49:14.260]  you're doing here.
[49:14.260 --> 49:15.460]  Wasn't me, look.
[49:15.460 --> 49:18.180]  All right, so a couple of weeks ago, weekends ago,
[49:18.180 --> 49:19.140]  two or three weekends ago,
[49:19.140 --> 49:20.260]  by the time this podcast comes out,
[49:20.260 --> 49:21.500]  it'll be three weekends.
[49:21.500 --> 49:22.860]  There was an event called the Frost Bowl.
[49:22.860 --> 49:27.020]  The Frost Bowl was a local cannabis competition
[49:27.020 --> 49:29.100]  where people grew cannabis and entered their cannabis
[49:29.100 --> 49:30.060]  and people were judging it.
[49:30.060 --> 49:33.660]  And there was a party where people were consuming cannabis
[49:33.660 --> 49:36.860]  and the police came and they raided that motherfucker.
[49:36.860 --> 49:37.940]  Oh, they didn't raid it.
[49:37.940 --> 49:39.020]  The word they used was raided,
[49:39.020 --> 49:39.900]  but they came and shut it down.
[49:39.900 --> 49:41.940]  But there were like 35 cops that surrounded the place
[49:41.940 --> 49:45.340]  and all stormed in all at once and shut the place down.
[49:45.340 --> 49:46.740]  Let's say we're at an event.
[49:47.780 --> 49:49.500]  Shoot, well, I have to change my event now.
[49:49.500 --> 49:50.700]  Cause I was going to say the cannabis cup,
[49:50.700 --> 49:51.980]  but as of the past couple of days,
[49:52.180 --> 49:53.860]  it does not look like the Denver Cannabis Cup
[49:53.860 --> 49:54.700]  is going to happen.
[49:54.700 --> 49:55.540]  Yes.
[49:55.540 --> 49:56.740]  It's there currently looking for a new venue.
[49:56.740 --> 49:57.620]  Yeah, new venue.
[49:57.620 --> 49:59.420]  Yeah, and it sounds like a lot of places
[49:59.420 --> 50:01.700]  are not going to be able to give that permit
[50:01.700 --> 50:02.540]  that they want.
[50:02.540 --> 50:03.700]  It's still in Pueblo, State Fair.
[50:03.700 --> 50:06.140]  State Fair has already said they don't want anything
[50:06.140 --> 50:07.580]  to do with any cannabis stuff.
[50:07.580 --> 50:09.460]  And nobody wants to come to Pueblo.
[50:09.460 --> 50:11.580]  But I mean, you know, if you did a cannabis cup there,
[50:11.580 --> 50:12.420]  they would.
[50:12.420 --> 50:13.260]  If you build it, they will come.
[50:13.260 --> 50:14.740]  That's, you're the man.
[50:14.740 --> 50:16.500]  So let's say you're walking,
[50:16.500 --> 50:19.180]  so Cannabis Cup happens at the state fairgrounds
[50:19.180 --> 50:20.140]  in Pueblo, Colorado.
[50:20.140 --> 50:21.500]  I could fucking take an Uber over there.
[50:22.020 --> 50:22.860]  It costs me six bucks.
[50:22.860 --> 50:23.820]  An Uber over there.
[50:23.820 --> 50:24.740]  I'm dabbing the fuck out.
[50:24.740 --> 50:25.820]  I'm walking around.
[50:25.820 --> 50:27.780]  I've got, I don't know,
[50:27.780 --> 50:29.380]  four grams of shatter in my pocket
[50:29.380 --> 50:31.220]  and seven grams of good flour.
[50:31.220 --> 50:32.380]  Okay, let's be real.
[50:32.380 --> 50:33.420]  I've got an ounce of good flour
[50:33.420 --> 50:35.180]  and I got like 10 grams of shatter in my possession.
[50:35.180 --> 50:37.860]  I'm legal to carry that as an adult in Colorado.
[50:37.860 --> 50:39.700]  Cop walks up to me and wants to give me shit.
[50:39.700 --> 50:43.140]  How do I handle myself with this cop in public?
[50:43.140 --> 50:44.460]  At an event, at a cannabis event
[50:44.460 --> 50:45.340]  where I'm going to be fucked with,
[50:45.340 --> 50:46.340]  sorry, I said straight in public,
[50:46.340 --> 50:49.180]  but it's at an event where we're all consuming.
[50:49.180 --> 50:51.020]  He's like, come here, I want to talk to you.
[50:52.180 --> 50:53.660]  Inside the event?
[50:53.660 --> 50:57.580]  No, I'd immediately like stop moving my feet
[50:57.580 --> 50:59.220]  and make sure my hands were in plain sight
[50:59.220 --> 51:01.300]  and just be like, what can I do for you, officer?
[51:01.300 --> 51:03.300]  I'd offer to smoke with him.
[51:03.300 --> 51:06.020]  Yeah, and just kind of resist their questions.
[51:06.020 --> 51:09.020]  Just the, am I being detained in my free to go circle?
[51:10.860 --> 51:12.500]  In an event like that, especially,
[51:12.500 --> 51:14.220]  like I'm not there to get messed with.
[51:14.220 --> 51:15.180]  I'm not doing anything.
[51:15.180 --> 51:16.220]  I haven't hurt anyone.
[51:16.220 --> 51:18.100]  I'm not carrying a weapon.
[51:18.100 --> 51:19.740]  I didn't steal anything.
[51:20.100 --> 51:23.140]  I'm just not in the mood to be harassed.
[51:23.140 --> 51:24.420]  That's how I'd play it.
[51:24.420 --> 51:26.100]  Not in the mood to be harassed.
[51:26.100 --> 51:26.940]  Yep.
[51:26.940 --> 51:29.260]  All right, do you say that to the cop?
[51:29.260 --> 51:30.100]  Occasionally.
[51:30.100 --> 51:30.940]  Occasionally.
[51:30.940 --> 51:32.220]  Like it hasn't really come up
[51:32.220 --> 51:34.620]  that I've had to run it like that since I was a teenager.
[51:34.620 --> 51:36.860]  Like the, good evening, officer, how are you?
[51:36.860 --> 51:38.500]  What can I do for you?
[51:38.500 --> 51:40.420]  It doesn't matter if it's, oh, I was speeding
[51:40.420 --> 51:42.020]  or, oh, we got a noise complaint
[51:42.020 --> 51:44.020]  or, oh, it smells like weed out front.
[51:44.900 --> 51:48.620]  If you start it off that way, nine times out of 10,
[51:48.620 --> 51:50.260]  just being polite and going like,
[51:50.260 --> 51:51.980]  no, I don't consent to any searches.
[51:51.980 --> 51:53.420]  No, I've got stuff to do later.
[51:53.420 --> 51:55.900]  Like, sorry guys.
[51:55.900 --> 51:57.020]  What can I do to help?
[51:57.020 --> 51:59.460]  Like, sorry guys.
[51:59.460 --> 52:00.300]  Have a good night.
[52:00.300 --> 52:03.140]  Usually that gets you through it in five or 10 minutes.
[52:03.140 --> 52:05.140]  Worst case scenario, they go get out of the car.
[52:05.140 --> 52:05.980]  They search your car.
[52:05.980 --> 52:06.820]  They find the weed.
[52:06.820 --> 52:07.820]  They write you a ticket for the weed.
[52:07.820 --> 52:08.660]  You go home.
[52:10.620 --> 52:11.940]  All right, that sounds reasonable.
[52:11.940 --> 52:13.700]  Sloppy standing up, taking a dab.
[52:13.700 --> 52:14.540]  Sorry.
[52:14.540 --> 52:15.380]  No, I like it.
[52:15.380 --> 52:17.220]  So you don't bump the rig on the mic.
[52:17.260 --> 52:18.540]  So you don't dab the microphone
[52:18.540 --> 52:20.060]  like you did last time you were here.
[52:20.060 --> 52:23.380]  Like, even if you're about to get in a bunch of trouble,
[52:23.380 --> 52:26.820]  playing it cool with the original interaction
[52:26.820 --> 52:31.620]  with the officer assures you don't get really injured
[52:31.620 --> 52:32.460]  during that interaction.
[52:32.460 --> 52:33.340]  Don't get injured.
[52:33.340 --> 52:34.780]  Something I didn't mention earlier
[52:34.780 --> 52:36.740]  that I should have totally mentioned.
[52:36.740 --> 52:39.780]  The cop that pulled my friend over and gave him a DUI
[52:39.780 --> 52:42.940]  asked him how long it had been since he smoked last.
[52:42.940 --> 52:44.420]  My friend tried to play Mr. Honesty
[52:44.420 --> 52:46.420]  and told him a little too early, I think.
[52:46.580 --> 52:49.460]  I think that played a part of the arrest.
[52:49.460 --> 52:50.660]  Say yesterday.
[52:51.500 --> 52:52.340]  Like, if that cop's like,
[52:52.340 --> 52:54.340]  how long ago you're driving to get pulled over?
[52:54.340 --> 52:56.220]  A cop's like, when is the last time
[52:56.220 --> 52:57.500]  you smoked cannabis?
[52:57.500 --> 52:58.980]  Yesterday.
[52:58.980 --> 52:59.940]  Yeah, not today.
[52:59.940 --> 53:00.900]  Before I went to bed.
[53:00.900 --> 53:02.860]  I only smoke cannabis to go to sleep.
[53:02.860 --> 53:04.220]  You're not obligated to answer any of those questions.
[53:04.220 --> 53:06.140]  So when the cop goes, how long has it been
[53:06.140 --> 53:07.580]  since you've consumed marijuana?
[53:07.580 --> 53:09.740]  You can say, I don't,
[53:09.740 --> 53:12.980]  or I'm not legally obligated to answer that question.
[53:12.980 --> 53:13.820]  Plead the case.
[53:13.820 --> 53:15.220]  Like, if you're driving,
[53:15.220 --> 53:17.420]  you're required to hand over like,
[53:17.420 --> 53:20.260]  license, registration, proof of insurance.
[53:20.260 --> 53:22.980]  But you're not legally required to self-incriminate.
[53:22.980 --> 53:26.420]  You're not legally required to answer any other questions.
[53:26.420 --> 53:27.820]  Dry snitching.
[53:27.820 --> 53:29.940]  Give them the minimum amount of information
[53:29.940 --> 53:30.900]  that you need to give them.
[53:30.900 --> 53:32.380]  Don't go on with stuff.
[53:33.260 --> 53:35.900]  You're legally obligated to comply.
[53:35.900 --> 53:38.780]  You can get arrested for just resisting.
[53:38.780 --> 53:41.220]  Like, if the cop walks up and you run away,
[53:41.220 --> 53:42.540]  like the cop didn't even say anything.
[53:42.580 --> 53:45.220]  You just saw him walk onto your block or whatever
[53:45.220 --> 53:46.420]  and immediately turned and ran
[53:46.420 --> 53:48.580]  and he chose to chase you and arrest you.
[53:48.580 --> 53:50.660]  You can get arrested for just resisting arrest.
[53:50.660 --> 53:51.860]  I got arrested for that.
[53:51.860 --> 53:55.340]  All charges got dropped immediately, but-
[53:56.860 --> 53:59.380]  A relation of mine got arrested just for that.
[54:01.940 --> 54:04.220]  They were climbing through the window of a party
[54:04.220 --> 54:06.020]  while he was in high school.
[54:06.020 --> 54:08.180]  And he put his arms out just to the sides
[54:08.180 --> 54:09.580]  and went, get out of my house, piggy.
[54:09.580 --> 54:11.820]  And he got tackled and handcuffed.
[54:11.820 --> 54:13.340]  And he thought it was hilarious,
[54:13.340 --> 54:16.340]  but he knew he'd survive it
[54:16.340 --> 54:19.820]  because after he was tackled and handcuffed,
[54:19.820 --> 54:21.340]  like he could do and say what he wanted
[54:21.340 --> 54:24.340]  and he was gonna get bailed out in less than 24 hours anyway.
[54:25.500 --> 54:26.340]  Yeah.
[54:27.220 --> 54:28.980]  I was young on probation,
[54:28.980 --> 54:31.620]  walking with another friend that was on probation.
[54:31.620 --> 54:33.940]  And we had heard that if you're on probation,
[54:33.940 --> 54:36.700]  you're not supposed to be with other people on probation.
[54:36.700 --> 54:39.340]  So these cops came up on us and I darted
[54:39.340 --> 54:42.660]  and then I had a little dub sack on me, but I threw it.
[54:43.620 --> 54:44.820]  And then I got arrested.
[54:44.820 --> 54:47.620]  And as soon as I went to jail, got bailed out.
[54:47.620 --> 54:48.820]  And then as soon as I went to court,
[54:48.820 --> 54:51.660]  he was like, where are the other charges?
[54:51.660 --> 54:52.620]  And I was like, what do you mean?
[54:52.620 --> 54:54.460]  He was like, well, what else did you get charged from us?
[54:54.460 --> 54:55.820]  Oh, I just ran because I thought
[54:55.820 --> 54:57.820]  I wasn't supposed to be hanging out with this person.
[54:57.820 --> 54:59.700]  Automatically dropped, let it go.
[54:59.700 --> 55:00.740]  Not on my record.
[55:00.740 --> 55:01.580]  Nice.
[55:01.580 --> 55:04.420]  So I mean, that's a easy choice to get out of
[55:04.420 --> 55:05.780]  if you're just completely-
[55:05.780 --> 55:07.420]  Even if you're about to get in trouble,
[55:07.420 --> 55:10.220]  it's so much easier to deal with in court without the,
[55:10.220 --> 55:12.100]  why did you run away?
[55:12.100 --> 55:15.100]  Like, why did you leave him on a car chase?
[55:15.100 --> 55:18.460]  Like, why did you injure detective so-and-so with your door?
[55:18.460 --> 55:19.780]  Don't do that type of shit.
[55:19.780 --> 55:20.740]  Just don't do that.
[55:20.740 --> 55:23.380]  You just play it cool and you're like-
[55:23.380 --> 55:24.220]  Slop turned his head.
[55:24.220 --> 55:25.260]  Get out of it in court.
[55:25.260 --> 55:26.100]  No, I burped.
[55:26.100 --> 55:27.060]  I wanted to be polite.
[55:27.980 --> 55:29.380]  You don't want to just let it go into the mic?
[55:29.380 --> 55:31.220]  No, it was directed towards you.
[55:31.220 --> 55:32.060]  I don't know.
[55:32.060 --> 55:32.900]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[55:32.900 --> 55:34.420]  Give you that Dr. Pepper stank.
[55:34.420 --> 55:36.860]  Shout out to the Dr. Pepper, those 23 Terps.
[55:37.220 --> 55:39.700]  Oh my God, Terp-a-licious.
[55:39.700 --> 55:40.700]  Flavor for days.
[55:40.700 --> 55:42.900]  Sometimes I pour other drinks in there, 25.
[55:46.100 --> 55:48.140]  Oh, interesting thing about the police.
[55:48.140 --> 55:50.380]  All right, so if you're getting pulled over
[55:50.380 --> 55:52.940]  by an unmarked vehicle,
[55:52.940 --> 55:55.540]  would you pull over or would you call it in?
[55:57.580 --> 55:59.620]  I'm a dude.
[56:00.700 --> 56:02.020]  I can handle myself.
[56:02.020 --> 56:03.220]  I feel like for the most part,
[56:03.220 --> 56:05.340]  I got pretty good judgment of what a cop looks like
[56:05.340 --> 56:06.340]  and whatnot.
[56:06.900 --> 56:08.060]  I'm not trying to be sexist here.
[56:08.060 --> 56:10.740]  If I were a small woman who wasn't as fucking,
[56:10.740 --> 56:13.140]  wasn't six, five and 200 pounds, you know what I mean?
[56:13.140 --> 56:14.460]  There are some girls that I'm not even trying to,
[56:14.460 --> 56:15.460]  you could pick some girls up
[56:15.460 --> 56:16.900]  and just fucking carry them off.
[56:16.900 --> 56:18.460]  If I was that size of a girl,
[56:18.460 --> 56:20.740]  I would, I don't know, I'd reconsider my options.
[56:20.740 --> 56:21.580]  Call it.
[56:21.580 --> 56:22.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[56:22.420 --> 56:23.540]  If you just call 911 and be like,
[56:23.540 --> 56:25.780]  hey, is this cop that's pulling me over for real?
[56:25.780 --> 56:26.620]  They'll tell you if it is or not.
[56:26.620 --> 56:29.380]  Just hit your hazard lights, slow way down,
[56:29.380 --> 56:30.980]  get over all the way to the right
[56:30.980 --> 56:33.300]  and then just do like four miles an hour.
[56:33.420 --> 56:37.340]  While you call 911, am I really being pulled over?
[56:37.340 --> 56:41.300]  Like I'm a tiny woman or I'm in a sketchy part of town
[56:41.300 --> 56:42.140]  or da da da da.
[56:42.140 --> 56:43.380]  It doesn't look like a cop car
[56:43.380 --> 56:46.020]  except for the flashing lights and the windshield.
[56:46.020 --> 56:48.940]  911 will know if you're being pulled over.
[56:48.940 --> 56:50.340]  For sure, yeah.
[56:50.340 --> 56:52.620]  And if it's not, they'll send people to pull over,
[56:52.620 --> 56:53.460]  whoever's trying to pull you over.
[56:53.460 --> 56:55.060]  Yeah, and then just sit there with your windows up
[56:55.060 --> 56:55.900]  and wait.
[56:55.900 --> 56:57.580]  And that way they can get the person that's trying to fuck.
[56:57.580 --> 56:59.660]  Do y'all remember when that was an issue?
[56:59.660 --> 57:01.900]  It still is from time to time.
[57:01.900 --> 57:03.740]  Every now and then you'll see in the police blotter
[57:03.740 --> 57:08.740]  was someone was arrested for pretending to be a cop.
[57:08.740 --> 57:10.740]  Like a year ago it happened here,
[57:10.740 --> 57:12.620]  but they pulled over a cop.
[57:12.620 --> 57:13.460]  Oh wow.
[57:13.460 --> 57:15.660]  And immediately he was like, you ain't a cop
[57:15.660 --> 57:16.900]  and like got out with his gun
[57:16.900 --> 57:18.740]  and was like, somebody go to jail.
[57:18.740 --> 57:20.940]  In North Carolina, somebody was impersonating
[57:20.940 --> 57:24.620]  as an officer and robbing people.
[57:24.620 --> 57:25.460]  Bless you, Joe.
[57:26.620 --> 57:28.300]  That's another thing.
[57:28.300 --> 57:30.220]  Do you think that you have to roll your window down
[57:30.260 --> 57:33.700]  all the way or can you just do it the next necessary amount
[57:33.700 --> 57:34.860]  to talk in exchange?
[57:34.860 --> 57:35.860]  Is that being a douche?
[57:35.860 --> 57:37.700]  Are you pushing the limit by not giving them
[57:37.700 --> 57:39.260]  the full window?
[57:39.260 --> 57:40.460]  What are you trying to prove?
[57:40.460 --> 57:42.660]  Yeah, I just roll it down and talk to him.
[57:42.660 --> 57:44.100]  I mean, yeah, because if somebody's gonna assault you,
[57:44.100 --> 57:45.660]  they're doing it through the glass anyway.
[57:45.660 --> 57:47.660]  That glass ain't stopping no like nothing.
[57:47.660 --> 57:51.060]  Good evening officer, how can I lick your ball sack today?
[57:51.060 --> 57:54.860]  Right, like that's why you play it cool from the get go
[57:54.860 --> 57:57.660]  so that the cop doesn't decide to play it
[57:57.660 --> 57:59.460]  the hardest way possible.
[58:00.500 --> 58:02.100]  Because they could just decide to arrest you
[58:02.100 --> 58:04.700]  and come through that window no problem.
[58:04.700 --> 58:05.820]  Just roll that fucker down.
[58:05.820 --> 58:07.460]  That's why you put the weed in the backseat
[58:07.460 --> 58:08.940]  or in the trunk.
[58:08.940 --> 58:10.860]  Throw it in an extra bag or a backpack
[58:10.860 --> 58:12.900]  so that your car doesn't stink while you're on the road.
[58:12.900 --> 58:14.980]  Don't have a roach burning in the ashtray
[58:14.980 --> 58:16.580]  when you get pulled over.
[58:16.580 --> 58:18.820]  Yeah, don't smoke and drive.
[58:18.820 --> 58:20.260]  Shout out to Oseum.
[58:20.260 --> 58:21.460]  I, man.
[58:24.140 --> 58:28.100]  I have to get on that don't smoke and drive shit for sure.
[58:28.100 --> 58:29.380]  Yeah, you gotta be careful with that, bro.
[58:29.500 --> 58:30.700]  DUI's are no fun.
[58:30.700 --> 58:32.140]  If you do get fucking pulled over,
[58:32.140 --> 58:34.140]  if you get fucked, get yourself a good lawyer.
[58:34.140 --> 58:35.100]  Yeah, get a lawyer.
[58:35.100 --> 58:37.340]  Yeah, if you can't afford a lawyer,
[58:37.340 --> 58:39.100]  get the free public defender one
[58:39.100 --> 58:41.340]  or go to a law school in your area.
[58:41.340 --> 58:44.060]  Nine times out of 10, they've got a third year law student
[58:44.060 --> 58:45.380]  who would fucking love to defend
[58:45.380 --> 58:47.260]  the living shit out of you for free.
[58:47.260 --> 58:49.260]  Don't believe what all your pothead friends
[58:49.260 --> 58:50.900]  are gonna tell you and shit.
[58:50.900 --> 58:53.060]  Like, they'll hype you up, they'll get you scared,
[58:53.060 --> 58:54.100]  they'll make you feel relaxed,
[58:54.100 --> 58:57.020]  but they're just, they are not a lawyer.
[58:57.020 --> 58:58.420]  They're not a judge, they don't know the law,
[58:58.460 --> 58:59.300]  they don't know what's gonna happen to you.
[58:59.300 --> 59:02.460]  So go get a lawyer, take their advice.
[59:02.460 --> 59:04.860]  Don't take your crazy uncle Larry's advice.
[59:04.860 --> 59:07.380]  Just go down there and tell them that you heard this.
[59:07.380 --> 59:10.540]  Just carry a fake ID and get arrested as somebody else.
[59:10.540 --> 59:11.620]  Don't do that.
[59:11.620 --> 59:12.460]  Terrible idea.
[59:12.460 --> 59:13.620]  Don't do that, please don't do that.
[59:13.620 --> 59:16.100]  Sloppy, bad, bad, sloppy.
[59:16.100 --> 59:16.940]  No doubt for you.
[59:16.940 --> 59:17.780]  All jokes.
[59:17.780 --> 59:18.740]  Bad, sloppy.
[59:18.740 --> 59:19.740]  Don't do that shit.
[59:21.740 --> 59:24.020]  That's like, yeah, I'd rather get caught
[59:24.020 --> 59:26.420]  with a little weed than with a fake ID, fuck.
[59:26.460 --> 59:29.780]  All right, so we've been going for a long time, you guys.
[59:29.780 --> 59:31.940]  Thanks for listening if you've made it an hour with us.
[59:31.940 --> 59:33.740]  That's a journey.
[59:33.740 --> 59:35.820]  Do time flies when there's a bunch of people at the table.
[59:35.820 --> 59:37.660]  Yes, it sure does.
[59:37.660 --> 59:40.980]  So does anybody have, would you like to shout out
[59:40.980 --> 59:42.740]  any social media or anything?
[59:42.740 --> 59:43.740]  Anything that you wanna say,
[59:43.740 --> 59:45.100]  since you got a microphone in your face
[59:45.100 --> 59:46.500]  and some people is listening.
[59:46.500 --> 59:47.860]  I'll start going, we'll just go to the left here.
[59:47.860 --> 59:50.100]  You got anything you'd like to say over there, my friend?
[59:50.100 --> 59:51.620]  Nah, not really.
[59:51.620 --> 59:52.700]  I'm just hanging out.
[59:52.700 --> 59:53.540]  Just hanging out.
[59:53.540 --> 59:56.260]  Kind of quiet this episode, but it's all good.
[59:57.100 --> 59:58.060]  Mike had a lot to say, it's cool.
[59:58.060 --> 01:00:00.020]  I wasn't trying, I was just hanging.
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.740]  Thanks for being here, brother.
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.580]  Yep.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.380]  All right, white Mike.
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.180]  Just be safe, people.
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:09.860]  Don't get fucked by being nervous.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.860]  How do our friends follow you on social media?
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:15.100]  You can find me at Nemopunk15 on Twitter
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:17.780]  or Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.940]  Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.740]  Make sure you support that, click it, give it a like,
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.420]  follow it, check out what Mike posts,
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.820]  share it, observe it.
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:29.740]  People should start paying attention to politics.
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.900]  Do get registered to vote.
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:33.860]  This next year is going to be interesting in most states.
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:37.060]  I wonder if Randy ever listens to the podcast.
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:37.900]  Fuck no.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.060]  Poor Randy and his little square dome.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.980]  No, he doesn't read anything
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:44.740]  that he suspects might not be pre-approved.
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.820]  It's a really interesting way of educating oneself.
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.180]  Somebody share this podcast with Randy.
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.340]  Let him learn the truth.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:53.860]  All right, sloppy, we're going to move over to you, Mike.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:55.180]  Thanks for coming again, bro.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.980]  I know you got to take time away from your youngster
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:57.820]  to come hang out with us.
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:58.860]  High five your boy for me.
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:00:59.700]  Will do.
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.660]  Nice.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.060]  Sloppy, sloppy.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.340]  How can all the people listening,
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.260]  how can they find you on social media?
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.620]  Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, however you want to do it.
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:12.140]  I am sloppy919 on everything,
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.940]  except for Tumblr, I think it's sloppybrains.
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:17.300]  Yeah, sloppybrains.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.980]  I didn't make that, but somebody made it for me.
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:25.780]  And then yeah, deadgod919 as well is our music.
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:28.020]  So you're trying to check that out.
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.980]  I think I followed that and didn't know that was you.
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:30.820]  Yep, that's me.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.980]  Boy, nice.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:33.820]  All right.
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.540]  Stay out the left lane, people.
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:38.060]  Oh, dude, are you fucking serious?
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.100]  Did you just say that?
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:43.340]  I, oh my God, I'm turning beet red over here
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.980]  trying not to smack the table.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:48.220]  I drive 50 miles to and from work every day.
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:50.620]  It's 50 miles each way, 100 miles on the road.
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:54.140]  There's one exit where I go that probably takes me
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.380]  10 minutes just to get on the damn on-ramp
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.140]  because of construction in Colorado Springs right now.
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.340]  If you're in the left lane, you should be passing somebody.
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:05.420]  If I am behind you in the left lane
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:08.220]  and you think I'm riding your ass, I am not an asshole.
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.580]  See, the left lane is for passing.
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:11.860]  That lane over there to the right
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.340]  is for the slower moving traffic.
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.580]  There are big signs on the interstate
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.500]  that say slower traffic, keep right.
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.060]  That means fucking you.
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:23.300]  Yeah, if I'm riding your ass in the left lane,
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.260]  all it means is you're a conceited fuck.
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.660]  That's what it's like.
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.180]  Don't flick your cigarette at me.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:29.580]  Don't give me the finger.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.300]  Put on your damn blinker and move over
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.940]  and let me zip past you.
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.500]  And then get back in the left lane if you want.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.460]  I don't even care if you're going 10 miles over
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.780]  and I'm trying to go 20.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:40.660]  Honestly, not to sound like fuck it,
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.540]  but the left lane is the go as fast as you please
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:45.820]  and risk getting a ticket lane, straight up.
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.540]  Like yeah, you're passing people
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:48.860]  and then get back in the right lane.
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:50.660]  As soon as you pass somebody, get in the right lane.
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:51.500]  Keep doing it.
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.260]  People will be like, oh, you're weaving a lot.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.700]  I'm like, no, I'm driving correctly, you fucking idiot.
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:58.580]  Like, ooh, ooh, yes, get out the left lane.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:02:59.780]  Get out the left lane.
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:00.700]  Get out the damn left lane.
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:03.300]  Oh, I didn't know there's a sign every five miles
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.380]  that says keep right unless passing.
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.620]  Truth.
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:10.380]  All right, and don't be that social justice warrior
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:11.900]  that tries to slow me down.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:12.820]  He's going too fast.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:13.780]  I'm gonna pull in front of him.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.340]  It's not your road.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.540]  No, it is our road.
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.420]  If I want to get a ticket, I'll take it.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.540]  I throw water bottles at people.
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:24.980]  Straight up, I've bonged a couple people with water bottles.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:26.140]  This is how the breeze-
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:29.020]  Not to do things now that you've grown up, right?
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.460]  You don't do that anymore, right, Sloppy?
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:31.300]  What?
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.140]  You don't do that?
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:33.780]  Sloppy, come on, Sloppy.
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:34.620]  Sloppy, help us out here.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.460]  No, I'm just playing.
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:37.940]  I did, but yeah, no, for real.
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:41.100]  Yo, driving is not a game.
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.380]  You're playing with people's lives.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:43.220]  Pay attention.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.980]  I get enraged sometimes when people do stupid shit
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:45.820]  on the road.
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.300]  Yeah, and I drive a Prius.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:48.900]  Nobody wants to get beat up by the guy
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.980]  that was driving the Prius,
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:51.460]  because then you got to go home and lie.
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.900]  You have to be like, it was six guys in a Jeep,
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:57.020]  and then no, it was one dude with a fucking Bob Ross Afro
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.580]  hopping out here and whooping your ass out the Prius,
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:00.420]  and then getting back in there.
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.900]  Tattooed Bob Ross in a Prius beat my ass.
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:04.220]  And then driving away in all ears.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:07.260]  Hello from the other side.
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:09.100]  Adele.
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:10.260]  It's hard to be tough when you pull up
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.140]  and your car goes wing, wing.
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:12.980]  No, you don't.
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:13.820]  No, that's where you're wrong.
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:16.020]  You don't hear the Prius pull up at all.
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:18.060]  I have literally had people in the car
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.260]  and then drove off and they were like,
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:20.460]  you started this?
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.300]  Like.
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:23.700]  Oh shit.
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:24.540]  All right.
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:25.580]  So we've got a long time.
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.180]  If you guys have been listening for this long,
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:28.300]  I love all of you.
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:29.660]  We're going to wrap up this part of the show.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.020]  We're going to take some dabs,
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:35.860]  and I will be back to put a tail on this episode.
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.700]  All right, guys.
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.540]  I want to send another huge thank you to our guests.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:39.580]  Big shout out to Buzzy.
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.420]  Big shout to Mike.

[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.540]  I want to give you another thank you
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.260]  for listening to this long episode.
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.420]  I will be back in seven days with another episode.
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.500]  I will have Rob from Sour Seeds here.
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.460]  We're going to talk about selecting a male plant
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.300]  for breeding.
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.500]  It should be a great educational episode.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.180]  I need to give another shout out to our sponsor.
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:57.460]  Big shout to Hitman Glass.
