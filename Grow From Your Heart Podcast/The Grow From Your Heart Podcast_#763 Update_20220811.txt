[00:00.000 --> 00:18.140]  All right, here we go.
[00:18.140 --> 00:19.860]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:19.860 --> 00:20.860]  I'm your host.
[00:20.860 --> 00:22.540]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:22.540 --> 00:27.940]  This is episode 763 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:27.940 --> 00:28.940]  I am back.
[00:28.940 --> 00:30.940]  I do apologize for the short hiatus.
[00:30.940 --> 00:32.180]  I did catch the plague.
[00:32.180 --> 00:34.780]  I was super sick for about 10 days.
[00:34.780 --> 00:36.060]  It's been almost two weeks now.
[00:36.060 --> 00:37.580]  I am still recovering.
[00:37.580 --> 00:39.860]  I still don't have all the air I feel like I should have.
[00:39.860 --> 00:43.980]  I feel like I'm a little clogged up in my chest, throat, nose, lung region here.
[00:43.980 --> 00:45.820]  My ears sound funky in the headphones.
[00:45.820 --> 00:46.980]  However, I am back.
[00:46.980 --> 00:49.820]  I'm doing my best to get back on the microphone.
[00:49.820 --> 00:51.500]  The podcast is not going away.
[00:51.500 --> 00:52.900]  I am not going away.
[00:52.900 --> 00:57.860]  I've just been sick, been trying to recover my energy, been trying to catch up on other
[00:57.860 --> 00:58.860]  chores.
[00:58.860 --> 01:01.700]  I do have another life also other than just podcasting.
[01:01.700 --> 01:05.420]  Been trying to keep up, catch up with that while recovering from the virus.
[01:05.420 --> 01:06.940]  It has not been fun.
[01:06.940 --> 01:11.220]  Thank you to everybody who has sent me well wishes, words of encouragement, people who
[01:11.220 --> 01:15.220]  have checked on me, people with all of your crazy and useful advice on how to beat the
[01:15.220 --> 01:16.220]  virus.
[01:16.220 --> 01:17.220]  Thank you.
[01:17.220 --> 01:21.220]  I think rest and hydration were the main factors that did help with that.
[01:21.220 --> 01:25.620]  Everything was basically misery if I wasn't just face down into a pillow under the air
[01:25.620 --> 01:26.620]  conditioner.
[01:26.620 --> 01:27.620]  It was terrible.
[01:27.620 --> 01:28.620]  You guys don't want to hear too much about it.
[01:28.620 --> 01:31.420]  It did feel like my blood was boiling and my brain was cooking.
[01:31.420 --> 01:33.340]  I'm glad that that part is over.
[01:33.340 --> 01:36.700]  I do want to apologize for missing the Dude Grows cup.
[01:37.460 --> 01:40.460]  I feel like a big turd for not being at the Dude Grows cup.
[01:40.460 --> 01:42.860]  I advertised for that for two months.
[01:42.860 --> 01:44.940]  I personally prepared for that for two months.
[01:44.940 --> 01:47.580]  Then I got the plague and I could not even go.
[01:47.580 --> 01:48.580]  I apologize.
[01:48.580 --> 01:52.620]  Big shout out to everybody who traveled from all over the world to come see me at the Dude
[01:52.620 --> 01:53.620]  Grows Grower's Cup.
[01:53.620 --> 01:57.300]  Not just come see me, but I know a lot of people are looking forward to seeing me.
[01:57.300 --> 01:58.940]  I feel like a big turd.
[01:58.940 --> 02:00.460]  Shout out to the people that traveled.
[02:00.460 --> 02:01.460]  Shout out to the people that made it.
[02:01.460 --> 02:02.460]  I appreciate you.
[02:02.460 --> 02:03.700]  I do apologize.
[02:03.700 --> 02:04.860]  I could not be there.
[02:04.860 --> 02:08.420]  Shout out to everybody that I told I was going to go see Jamiri Morgan.
[02:08.420 --> 02:09.420]  Shout out to Jamiri.
[02:09.420 --> 02:10.740]  Could not make it to that show either.
[02:10.740 --> 02:12.980]  I was super sick that whole week.
[02:12.980 --> 02:16.260]  I do want to give a big giant shout out to my buddy White Mike.
[02:16.260 --> 02:20.740]  White Mike, if you're listening, bro, high five, high five, salute, fist bump, all the
[02:20.740 --> 02:21.740]  above.
[02:21.740 --> 02:22.740]  Thank you, bro.
[02:22.740 --> 02:23.740]  You did a hell of a job.
[02:23.740 --> 02:26.340]  I was not able to attend the Dude Grows cup.
[02:26.340 --> 02:30.260]  I sent Mike with all of the booth equipment for the iRegenetics booth.
[02:30.260 --> 02:31.460]  He set up the booth.
[02:31.460 --> 02:32.460]  He kicked ass.
[02:32.460 --> 02:33.660]  He met the people.
[02:33.660 --> 02:34.660]  He sold a gang of seeds.
[02:35.460 --> 02:37.020]  He made a lot of friends, made a lot of contacts.
[02:37.020 --> 02:40.180]  Mike, I got nothing but great feedback about you.
[02:40.180 --> 02:42.620]  Everybody said you were a great dude, that you did a good job.
[02:42.620 --> 02:43.620]  So thank you.
[02:43.620 --> 02:44.620]  I appreciate your help, bro.
[02:44.620 --> 02:47.020]  Thank you for going and running the iRegenetics booth.
[02:47.020 --> 02:50.900]  There's nobody else that I would trust and rather do that booth for me other than you.
[02:50.900 --> 02:53.420]  There's one other person I've ever let work a booth for me.
[02:53.420 --> 02:55.180]  So shout out to you guys for helping me.
[02:55.180 --> 02:57.260]  I feel like I'm rambling on.
[02:57.260 --> 02:59.060]  Talking about the Dude Grows cup.
[02:59.060 --> 03:02.540]  Big shout out to my buddy Hobbit Feet for his victory at the Dude Grows cup.
[03:02.940 --> 03:06.020]  It was great to see Irie Army win the Dude Grows cup.
[03:06.020 --> 03:07.020]  Shout out, bro.
[03:07.020 --> 03:08.020]  I am proud of you.
[03:08.020 --> 03:09.020]  We've got to turn this mic up just a little bit.
[03:09.020 --> 03:12.180]  I can't put enough air into the microphone, into my voice to make it loud enough.
[03:12.180 --> 03:13.180]  I can see it's too quiet.
[03:13.180 --> 03:15.740]  I apologize if it's too quiet.
[03:15.740 --> 03:17.260]  Shout out to Hobbit Feet, bro.
[03:17.260 --> 03:18.260]  Congratulations, bro.
[03:18.260 --> 03:22.220]  Also, congrats to Justin and JR Token, second and third place winners at the Dude Grows
[03:22.220 --> 03:23.220]  cup.
[03:23.220 --> 03:24.500]  You guys are all champions in my book.
[03:24.500 --> 03:28.700]  I know all three of you, great people, great growers, great members of the community.
[03:28.700 --> 03:32.500]  I was proud to see your names and faces pop up as the winners.
[03:33.460 --> 03:34.460]  I feel like I'm going super fast.
[03:34.460 --> 03:36.140]  I'm going to run out of breath here and run out of energy.
[03:36.140 --> 03:37.620]  This will be a quick podcast.
[03:37.620 --> 03:42.180]  I just wanted to pop in, explain what was going on, say that I'm not gone, the show's
[03:42.180 --> 03:44.060]  not gone, I didn't go anywhere.
[03:44.060 --> 03:45.060]  Stick with me.
[03:45.060 --> 03:47.340]  I will get this train back on the rails very soon.
[03:47.340 --> 03:48.860]  I'm going to try to keep moving here.
[03:48.860 --> 03:51.900]  I want to give a big shout out to the Dude Grows crew.
[03:51.900 --> 03:57.420]  The Dude, Scotty, Guru, Banner, everybody behind the scenes that I don't remember to
[03:57.420 --> 04:01.820]  mention right now because I still feel like I'm half brain dead and I didn't write enough
[04:02.140 --> 04:05.900]  shout out to everybody from the Dude Grows crew who put together Shelby.
[04:05.900 --> 04:06.900]  Big shout out to Shelby.
[04:06.900 --> 04:09.140]  Thank you for the great communication.
[04:09.140 --> 04:12.700]  Everybody thank you for the putting the event together and throwing a great event.
[04:12.700 --> 04:15.900]  Even though I couldn't attend it, Team Irie Genetics had a great time.
[04:15.900 --> 04:16.900]  Mike had a good time.
[04:16.900 --> 04:18.540]  The Irie Army had a good time.
[04:18.540 --> 04:20.540]  They were there in full force.
[04:20.540 --> 04:24.340]  And of course the Irie Army came home with the victory with Hobbit feet bringing home
[04:24.340 --> 04:25.340]  the trophy.
[04:25.340 --> 04:26.340]  Shout out to our Dude.
[04:26.340 --> 04:31.660]  But shout out to the Dude, Scotty, Guru, Shelby, Banner, everybody else involved.
[04:32.500 --> 04:33.500]  Thank you guys.
[04:33.500 --> 04:36.340]  I do appreciate you throwing an event for the community.
[04:36.340 --> 04:37.340]  Thanks for the invite.
[04:37.340 --> 04:38.700]  Thanks for including me.
[04:38.700 --> 04:42.700]  Extra thanks for the phone calls that I got the day before and the day of the event.
[04:42.700 --> 04:44.140]  People were calling like, what's up dude?
[04:44.140 --> 04:45.140]  We hear you're sick.
[04:45.140 --> 04:46.140]  Are you going to make it?
[04:46.140 --> 04:47.340]  And I was like, I'm not going to make it.
[04:47.340 --> 04:49.380]  People were super disappointed.
[04:49.380 --> 04:52.500]  But thanks for the love, the encouragement, the fist bumps, all that stuff.
[04:52.500 --> 04:54.580]  It does mean a lot to me.
[04:54.580 --> 04:59.260]  Also speaking of encouragement and love, big shout out to Zara for taking great care of
[04:59.260 --> 05:02.020]  me while I was not feeling well.
[05:02.020 --> 05:07.460]  I was laying on the couch face down into the couch just dying and she made sure to give
[05:07.460 --> 05:10.180]  me a bunch of juice and hydrate me and feed me.
[05:10.180 --> 05:13.280]  She's putting a cold washcloth on my head and on my neck and on my feet and shit trying
[05:13.280 --> 05:14.840]  to save my life.
[05:14.840 --> 05:16.700]  Without her, I don't know how well that would have gone.
[05:16.700 --> 05:17.700]  So big shout out.
[05:17.700 --> 05:18.700]  Thanks babe.
[05:18.700 --> 05:19.700]  Much love for that.
[05:19.700 --> 05:21.540]  You guys, I wouldn't be here without Miss Dread Vibe.
[05:21.540 --> 05:22.540]  So thanks Zara.
[05:22.540 --> 05:24.020]  Love you every day.
[05:24.020 --> 05:25.020]  Thanks for rescuing me.
[05:25.020 --> 05:26.500]  You guys, I'm still a little bit weak.
[05:26.500 --> 05:28.020]  I can hear it in my voice.
[05:28.020 --> 05:29.500]  I can hear it coming through the mic.
[05:29.500 --> 05:30.780]  This doesn't sound good to me.
[05:30.780 --> 05:35.540]  So I'm not going to make you listen to a long show where my voice sounds just not quality.
[05:35.540 --> 05:38.220]  I'm going to get the shows back on schedule soon.
[05:38.220 --> 05:40.060]  This I'm going to put this one out.
[05:40.060 --> 05:41.300]  This will be the Thursday show.
[05:41.300 --> 05:45.940]  There may not be a Monday show unless I can get this junk in my ears to not sound all
[05:45.940 --> 05:46.940]  goopy and weird.
[05:46.940 --> 05:49.220]  I don't want to record more than I need to right now.
[05:49.220 --> 05:50.220]  It just doesn't sound good.
[05:50.220 --> 05:51.300]  You guys deserve a better show.
[05:51.300 --> 05:54.620]  I expect better from myself and so do you.
[05:54.620 --> 05:58.420]  One thing that I really did enjoy seeing was people said, hey bro, you haven't taken
[05:58.420 --> 06:01.580]  a week off in like seven or eight years.
[06:01.580 --> 06:03.140]  Take a break and take care of yourself.
[06:03.140 --> 06:04.620]  I appreciate that you guys.
[06:04.620 --> 06:09.460]  I haven't missed a show in seven or eight years when the plague happened, the pandemic
[06:09.460 --> 06:10.460]  happened.
[06:10.460 --> 06:12.020]  Everybody kind of took a break and slowed down.
[06:12.020 --> 06:13.380]  I doubled my speed.
[06:13.380 --> 06:16.380]  I went from an audio podcast to a video podcast.
[06:16.380 --> 06:19.140]  I really stepped up to seed business because I was stuck at home.
[06:19.140 --> 06:21.060]  I couldn't go do my other jobs that I had.
[06:21.060 --> 06:24.060]  So I really focused in on this stuff and I didn't take a break.
[06:24.500 --> 06:26.140]  A lot of people did get to slow down, take a break.
[06:26.140 --> 06:28.420]  A lot of people were forced to take a break.
[06:28.420 --> 06:33.740]  This sickness, this virus that I caught was kind of a, it was a sort of a force for me
[06:33.740 --> 06:37.060]  to slow down and take a break to see what really needs to be done, what doesn't need
[06:37.060 --> 06:39.740]  to be done, what order of priority shit matter.
[06:39.740 --> 06:41.260]  So it did kind of show me some things.
[06:41.260 --> 06:43.340]  The priorities are still the podcast.
[06:43.340 --> 06:47.540]  Don't worry, it's not going away, but a good quality show is very important to me.
[06:47.540 --> 06:49.740]  I want to make sure to get these shows up to speed.
[06:49.740 --> 06:54.020]  Thanks to everybody who told me, take a break, catch your breath, get your temperature down.
[06:54.020 --> 06:58.020]  Rehydrate, take some zinc, take some fucking, I was recommended all kinds of vitamins.
[06:58.020 --> 07:00.340]  I got a mailbox full of great supplements and shit.
[07:00.340 --> 07:01.980]  Thank you guys.
[07:01.980 --> 07:07.140]  Everybody who helped take care of me, encouraged me, checked on me, sent me love, energy, vibes,
[07:07.140 --> 07:11.060]  prayers, chocolate, Grubhub, DoorDash, juices.
[07:11.060 --> 07:12.060]  Thank you.
[07:12.060 --> 07:13.060]  I appreciate all that stuff.
[07:13.060 --> 07:17.900]  I'm getting a lot better, but I'm still, it's been, I want to say I've been virus free probably
[07:17.900 --> 07:22.380]  for four or five days and I still feel kind of strange, you guys.
[07:22.380 --> 07:25.700]  In the meantime, while I'm working on recovering, I'm going to keep recording.
[07:25.700 --> 07:27.380]  As soon as I get better, I'll start recording again.
[07:27.380 --> 07:28.380]  We'll keep the show going.
[07:28.380 --> 07:31.380]  But in the meantime, you guys go listen to the older episodes.
[07:31.380 --> 07:34.620]  This is 763, which means there are 700.
[07:34.620 --> 07:38.220]  I'm going to say there's probably 500 good episodes out there that you should be listening
[07:38.220 --> 07:39.220]  to.
[07:39.220 --> 07:40.380]  Go listen to all that old stuff.
[07:40.380 --> 07:42.600]  Catch up while I'm not able to give you new shit.
[07:42.600 --> 07:43.700]  Do me the favor.
[07:43.700 --> 07:45.300]  Go listen to the old stuff.
[07:45.300 --> 07:52.300]  Something I did notice, the podcast was approaching 10,000 YouTube subscribers.
[07:52.340 --> 07:56.980]  Hopefully by the time I get well and get ready to rock more episodes, we're at 10,000.
[07:56.980 --> 07:58.500]  Don't leave me now is what I'm saying.
[07:58.500 --> 08:00.620]  Just because I'm sick, just because I can't keep up.
[08:00.620 --> 08:01.620]  Don't ditch us now.
[08:01.620 --> 08:02.620]  Let's get more subscribers.
[08:02.620 --> 08:03.620]  Let's get it up to 10,000.
[08:03.620 --> 08:05.420]  I was really excited to see that happen.
[08:05.420 --> 08:08.060]  Then I got punched in the face with the plague.
[08:08.060 --> 08:11.060]  Man, that's all I think I'm going to ramble about.
[08:11.060 --> 08:14.780]  This is just going to be a quick 10 minute episode, maybe even shorter than that.
[08:14.780 --> 08:19.820]  What I can ask for is please do send a lot of content.
[08:19.820 --> 08:20.980]  Send me questions.
[08:20.980 --> 08:22.060]  I like the questions.
[08:22.820 --> 08:25.460]  I've got a stack here in front of me, but they're going to burn out quite quickly.
[08:25.460 --> 08:27.140]  Please do send me a lot of grow questions.
[08:27.140 --> 08:34.140]  You can send them to growfromyourheartathotmail.com or go to my website, ieregenetics.com and there's
[08:34.140 --> 08:35.300]  a grow help tab.
[08:35.300 --> 08:36.300]  Click on that.
[08:36.300 --> 08:37.300]  Fill out the questionnaire.
[08:37.300 --> 08:38.300]  Send me your grow questions.
[08:38.300 --> 08:40.540]  I will put those on the podcast.
[08:40.540 --> 08:41.540]  That is how I build shows.
[08:41.540 --> 08:45.740]  I love building podcasts based on listener generated content.
[08:45.740 --> 08:48.980]  If you've got the question, that means a lot of other people out there probably have the
[08:48.980 --> 08:50.360]  same question.
[08:50.400 --> 08:55.320]  We can help a lot of people with one podcast episode with one good email.
[08:55.320 --> 08:56.320]  Send me your questions.
[08:56.320 --> 08:57.520]  Listen to those old episodes.
[08:57.520 --> 08:58.520]  I'm not going anywhere.
[08:58.520 --> 08:59.520]  I just need a minute.
[08:59.520 --> 09:02.480]  I need to get my oxygen levels and energy levels back up.
[09:02.480 --> 09:04.400]  We'll be back on fire here in no time.
[09:04.400 --> 09:05.400]  You know how it is.
[09:05.400 --> 09:08.160]  We'll be back in and dabbing and back in action.
[09:08.160 --> 09:09.640]  I'll be back on the Discord.
[09:09.640 --> 09:10.760]  We'll be hanging out.
[09:10.760 --> 09:11.840]  Just give me a minute.
[09:11.840 --> 09:12.840]  Thank you.
[09:12.840 --> 09:13.840]  Also, thank you.
[09:13.840 --> 09:14.840]  I apologize and thank you.
[09:14.840 --> 09:16.200]  That was the whole point of this episode.
[09:16.200 --> 09:17.200]  Thanks for checking on me.
[09:17.480 --> 09:20.720]  Also, thanks for the big box of gifts from the Dude Grows crew.
[09:20.720 --> 09:21.720]  That was super awesome.
[09:21.720 --> 09:23.560]  I've got a lot of fun shit to go through.
[09:23.560 --> 09:28.320]  Maybe we'll talk more in depth about that in a future episode when I got more air to
[09:28.320 --> 09:29.320]  talk.
[09:29.320 --> 09:30.320]  All right.
[09:30.320 --> 09:32.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[09:32.760 --> 09:36.680]  cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful, grow from your heart cannabis enthusiasts
[09:36.680 --> 09:37.680]  out there.
[09:37.680 --> 09:39.680]  This is all I've got for you for this quick episode.
[09:39.680 --> 09:43.320]  I'll be back as soon as I can to get the show back up to speed.
[09:43.320 --> 09:45.840]  I want to deliver you the quality content that you deserve.
[09:45.840 --> 09:46.840]  I'm doing my best.
[09:47.480 --> 09:48.480]  I'm hydrating.
[09:48.480 --> 09:49.480]  I'm taking vitamins.
[09:49.480 --> 09:50.960]  I got all the juices you could imagine.
[09:50.960 --> 09:52.640]  All the hippie shit you could dream of.
[09:52.640 --> 09:55.880]  It is helping, but I feel like I got wiped out.
[09:55.880 --> 09:56.880]  All right.
[09:56.880 --> 09:57.880]  That is all I've got for you for this episode.
[09:57.880 --> 10:01.600]  I'll be back in someday, pretty soon, hopefully, with fresh new content.
[10:01.600 --> 10:03.720]  Let's give a big shout out to my buddy Hobbit Feet.
[10:03.720 --> 10:06.960]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
