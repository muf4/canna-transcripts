[01:16.440 --> 01:18.360]  big thanks and big shout out to
[01:18.360 --> 01:23.000]  Everybody who continues to support the podcast on patreon if you are not already

[01:28.040 --> 01:30.040]  www.patreon.com
[01:30.480 --> 01:34.940]  Forward slash grow from your heart all of the information you need will be right there on the screen
[01:34.940 --> 01:35.640]  And you know
[01:35.640 --> 01:41.440]  I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it super easy for all of my friends to
[01:41.700 --> 01:48.220]  Support the podcast. I do want to start off by saying thank you to everybody who supported the Black Friday sale
[01:48.300 --> 01:54.340]  That's right. If you listen to the last episode I did mention a Black Friday sale and I redirect that sale has been great
[01:54.340 --> 01:57.320]  It will continue for a couple of days after this episode comes out
[01:57.340 --> 02:02.780]  There will be Black Friday cyber Monday and then it'll just be kind of stoner Tuesday and lingering Wednesday
[02:02.780 --> 02:05.500]  Then we'll probably have to wrap up the sale pretty quickly after that
[02:05.660 --> 02:08.660]  But thank you for the huge support the sale is still going on
[02:09.060 --> 02:12.220]  Everybody that did purchase beans from that sale did get freebies
[02:12.300 --> 02:19.140]  Everybody gets freebies every time you order from I redirect a lot of those people will get freebies that are tester seeds
[02:19.140 --> 02:21.240]  They are clearly labeled that they are tester seeds
[02:21.240 --> 02:26.460]  A lot of them will come with a plant a pamphlet that tells you what I hope will happen and what I expect of those
[02:26.460 --> 02:29.340]  Tester seeds. It's not a requirement. It's nothing I really
[02:29.900 --> 02:34.860]  Require you to do but it would be cool if when you get those tester seeds if you go to my discord and post some
[02:34.860 --> 02:40.180]  Pictures of the progress post some pictures to social media of those tester beans. They are a free gift to you
[02:40.180 --> 02:43.460]  But in return I would love some photography maybe a grow report
[02:43.460 --> 02:47.900]  So if you did get those tester beans in the package without the pamphlet, please join the discord
[02:47.900 --> 02:48.980]  All the info will be there
[02:48.980 --> 02:53.460]  If you did get the pamphlet that I recently got printed it took a while to get that here because of holiday shipping
[02:53.460 --> 02:56.540]  But most of the orders did come with a tester pamphlet
[02:56.540 --> 03:00.020]  If you got testers, please join the discord and post your pictures
[03:00.020 --> 03:05.700]  And I guess that is a good way to segue into talking about my new method of doing tester seeds
[03:05.700 --> 03:12.380]  I have been overwhelmed with tester applications. A lot of people want to run tester seeds for me. I appreciate it
[03:12.380 --> 03:17.940]  I enjoy that you are so enthusiastic about my brand and that you've got so much trust in my product that you're willing to run
[03:17.940 --> 03:22.140]  Testers before I've even tried them. We're putting out brand new shit. Thank you for the enthusiasm
[03:22.980 --> 03:26.000]  One of the things that happens is I select a lot of testers
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.580]  I send them seeds and only about maybe 50 or 60 percent of those testers will actually
[03:30.740 --> 03:37.240]  Reply and put poke pictures and post pictures of the progress of the plants on any form of social media
[03:37.240 --> 03:41.180]  It's like a I make a lot of donations with brand new seeds is kind of what it feels like
[03:41.460 --> 03:46.140]  Since I was making a lot of donations with the seeds and people would fail to continue correspondence
[03:46.140 --> 03:50.900]  I've decided just to give the testers away with orders if you're purchasing seeds from iRedirect
[03:50.900 --> 03:56.740]  There's a good chance. You'll get a pack of tester seeds in that order. Those are free. You've got some brand new stuff
[03:56.740 --> 04:00.840]  You've got things that a lot of people do not have you've got things that are not for sale at this time
[04:00.840 --> 04:05.540]  If you've got testers you're getting those because I want those ran you can run them at your leisure
[04:05.540 --> 04:07.300]  You can run them now you can run them later
[04:07.300 --> 04:10.220]  But when you run them just tag me post some pictures
[04:10.220 --> 04:16.460]  Maybe join the discord that will help me determine if those seeds are worth putting out to the general public. I can grow them
[04:16.460 --> 04:20.620]  I know they grow well for me. But what do they do for you? Are they successful in your garden?
[04:20.620 --> 04:25.800]  Are there any problems? Is there anything I should notice anything that may make me not want to put those seeds out?
[04:25.800 --> 04:31.260]  I need a bunch of people to grow those and the easiest way is to include them with paid orders and let people get them
[04:31.260 --> 04:34.020]  As a free gift as a free. Thank you in the future
[04:34.020 --> 04:37.020]  I may add tester seeds to the website for a very low price
[04:37.380 --> 04:41.620]  I've learned that people respect things they pay for a lot more than free things
[04:41.620 --> 04:45.140]  So I will get more communication more correspondence more feedback
[04:45.140 --> 04:49.980]  If I just give them to you as a gift with your paid order or if I charge you just a minimum price
[04:50.100 --> 04:51.460]  For those tester seeds
[04:51.460 --> 04:53.820]  So we will be changing up the way we do testers here
[04:53.820 --> 04:56.860]  If you are testing if you're running test seeds if you've been involved
[04:56.860 --> 05:03.100]  I still want all of your feedback all of your reports. Please send all of that to the discord server join my discord
[05:03.100 --> 05:05.100]  There's a link in the show notes in the video description
[05:05.340 --> 05:12.780]  Join the discord server find the tester tab and please post away post weekly grow reports weekly pictures weekly updates
[05:13.140 --> 05:15.780]  Anything that you think I should know about that strain that
[05:15.900 --> 05:19.100]  Anybody else growing that strain may want to know anything that is helpful useful
[05:19.380 --> 05:24.540]  Any sort of advice guidance or tips you can give if it was amazing or even if you saw something terrible
[05:24.740 --> 05:29.860]  In a seed line that I gave you as a tester, please report that I don't just want good feedback
[05:29.860 --> 05:32.580]  Don't worry about the ego. This is real testing
[05:32.580 --> 05:34.540]  We need to know if those seeds are worth
[05:34.540 --> 05:38.420]  Worthy and worthwhile to send to other growers if they don't work well for you
[05:38.420 --> 05:42.340]  Let us know so I can consider holding them back and not putting them out to the public
[05:42.340 --> 05:44.540]  That is what a responsible breeder should do
[05:44.580 --> 05:50.740]  So that is a long ramble on you're going to get some testers in your packages and the testers may appear on the website in
[05:50.740 --> 05:56.020]  The near future for a small price. All I'm asking for in return is photos and grow reports
[05:56.020 --> 06:02.540]  You're gonna get really low priced and basically free seeds in exchange for quality grow reports and high quality photos
[06:02.540 --> 06:05.020]  That's all I ask of so, please help me out
[06:05.020 --> 06:08.780]  All right. Let's move forward that felt like that took a lot longer than it should have
[06:09.020 --> 06:12.660]  Did I mention that every order at I redirect it does get free beans?
[06:12.660 --> 06:16.580]  I think I said that but that is on the notes wanted to make sure oh one more thing. I should mention
[06:16.580 --> 06:21.820]  I hope everybody had a happy holiday season. I am recording right after the Thanksgiving holiday
[06:21.820 --> 06:25.540]  I don't know if you celebrate that but my family had a great holiday gathering
[06:25.540 --> 06:28.940]  We had some good food some good times shout out to everybody who gathered for that
[06:29.300 --> 06:32.340]  Also after that I was gifted a piece of medicated
[06:32.580 --> 06:37.460]  Pumpkin pie when one of my friends said that they made pumpkin pie and they infused it with ganja
[06:37.460 --> 06:39.860]  You know that I had to take a fat slice of that
[06:39.860 --> 06:45.580]  I ate that about 40 minutes ago and I can honestly feel it starting to work now as I'm doing the intro to the show
[06:45.580 --> 06:52.060]  Here I have no idea how long I've been recording. It could have been 15 minutes or it could have been three hours at this point
[06:52.060 --> 06:58.620]  I really do not know but it's gonna be a great podcast because medicated pumpkin pie. All right, I've got one more fun thing
[06:58.620 --> 07:01.900]  I want to ramble about here before we segue into the main topic of this podcast
[07:01.980 --> 07:05.180]  I want to give a big shout out to my friends at comedy works
[07:05.180 --> 07:10.820]  And I also want to give a big shout out to big J. Oker sin. I took the lovely Zara miss dread vibes
[07:10.820 --> 07:12.760]  Mrs. Irie as you guys also call her
[07:12.760 --> 07:18.340]  I got to take her to see big J. Oker sin at comedy works on Saturday night at the late show
[07:18.340 --> 07:24.660]  And it was a great time the staff and crew at comedy works treat myself and miss dread vibes
[07:24.660 --> 07:30.240]  Like we are royalty. They treat us like rock stars. It was a great time. Thank you guys if anybody from comedy works
[07:30.240 --> 07:34.960]  Here's this. Thank you. I always have a great time at that club. It is the best comedy club on the planet
[07:34.960 --> 07:38.940]  You guys treat me. Well, you do it, right? It is always a good show at comedy works
[07:38.940 --> 07:41.980]  You guys go to comedy works free advertising for the club right there
[07:41.980 --> 07:46.580]  But also a big shout out to I should also give a big shout out to Zara on miss dread vibes
[07:47.060 --> 07:50.900]  Lovely lovely day for the evening. That was a great time. She's got dreadlocks
[07:50.900 --> 07:54.940]  I've got dreadlocks big J. Oker sin did about an hour worth of material
[07:54.940 --> 08:01.700]  I think the first 15 or 20 minutes of that was just him roasting myself and miss dread vibes
[08:01.700 --> 08:05.700]  Mrs. Irie Zara, whatever you'd like to call her. We got roasted
[08:05.900 --> 08:10.300]  He made a bunch of great jokes about our dreadlocks about just cliche dreadlock shit
[08:10.660 --> 08:14.740]  That's the second time that I've seen big J. Oker sin in the front row at comedy works
[08:14.740 --> 08:16.980]  Oh, I should mention I was in the front row. Thank you to comedy works
[08:16.980 --> 08:18.860]  I was in the front row for that show
[08:18.860 --> 08:24.420]  That was the second time that I've seen big J in the front row and he actually asked me a couple of the same
[08:24.540 --> 08:29.140]  Questions as he did last time I was giving him similar answers and hoping it would trigger some memories
[08:29.140 --> 08:33.260]  But the dude was so stoned. There was no way he was gonna even remember any of that
[08:33.260 --> 08:37.060]  So big shout out to comedy works for treating myself and miss dread vibes like a rock star
[08:37.140 --> 08:40.700]  Big shout out to miss dread vibes or miss Zara for being a fucking rock star
[08:40.700 --> 08:46.960]  Then also, of course big shout out to big J. Oker sin for coming to Colorado crushing it throwing down a good show
[08:46.960 --> 08:52.080]  You guys follow big J. Oker sin check out all of his podcasts Legion of skanks the bonfire
[08:52.080 --> 08:57.240]  He's all over the East Coast the Philly shit. All right that wraps up the Rasta Jeff portion of the podcast
[08:57.240 --> 09:03.640]  Let's move in to the email portion of this show. I've got a great email here in front of me this one
[09:03.640 --> 09:06.360]  I don't know if they want their name said but it goes a lot like this
[09:06.360 --> 09:12.720]  It came from the patreon patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. It says here's a good podcast question
[09:12.720 --> 09:14.800]  I agree with you brother. This was a great question
[09:14.800 --> 09:17.080]  It says I was just thinking about this
[09:17.080 --> 09:21.080]  I'm growing some stuff from another breeder and some of the machine in the same
[09:21.280 --> 09:24.440]  Tent you have stated that the machine has a very strong odor
[09:24.760 --> 09:30.400]  Can that odor actually change the flavor profile of other strains being grown in a 4x4?
[09:30.480 --> 09:36.880]  Tent the other cultivars have a very different profile than your machine. They are more fruity smelling
[09:36.880 --> 09:38.240]  That is a really good question
[09:38.240 --> 09:44.080]  I have mentioned before that the machine does make gassy chemical aromas that are very potent and very pungent
[09:44.200 --> 09:49.000]  Looks like you're growing other stuff that makes a fruity turf profile a fruity flavor and aroma
[09:49.480 --> 09:53.580]  You're more you're kind of concerned about those flavors intermingling and crossing
[09:53.580 --> 09:58.760]  You don't want that stanky nasty machine to mess up the fruit candy of the other thing that you are growing
[09:58.800 --> 10:05.280]  That is understandable. I do not think that you've got to worry about that during the grow during the grow cycle
[10:05.280 --> 10:09.200]  I do not think those turps were in will intermingle. I don't think they'll contaminate each other
[10:09.200 --> 10:12.280]  I don't think that that will be a problem during the grow phase
[10:12.280 --> 10:15.320]  That's nothing to worry about the plants are gonna produce turps
[10:15.320 --> 10:21.680]  The turps were volatilized the plant will continue to produce turpines as it grows now when we shift into the dry and cure phase
[10:21.680 --> 10:27.320]  At that point you can absolutely contaminate and cross flavor the things in the room by having
[10:27.760 --> 10:33.800]  Maybe if you put the machine next to a strawberry flavored plant some of that chemical aroma and some of that strawberry aroma
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.480]  That may travel over and that's just the aroma getting stuck into the dried buds
[10:37.480 --> 10:39.480]  That's a little bit of a different phenomenon there
[10:39.480 --> 10:41.960]  So I wouldn't worry about it so much in the grow
[10:41.960 --> 10:46.840]  But when is when it comes to drying and cure it keep those separate if you can don't put them in the same
[10:46.840 --> 10:49.880]  Container together you can dry them in the same room in the same space
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.920]  But when it comes to cure them and you're sealing them, that's when I would keep them separate
[10:53.920 --> 10:56.520]  That's when the aroma is gonna transfer over and it's not really
[10:56.880 --> 10:59.320]  It's not it's just the aroma sticking in the other one
[10:59.320 --> 11:03.400]  Like if you've been around weed and it gets in your shirt that weed smell is gonna stick in the other buds
[11:03.400 --> 11:06.760]  Just like the weed smell sticks in your shirt. That is my theory
[11:06.760 --> 11:11.640]  I don't have absolute science on that. But in my opinion, I would not be worried. I've grown
[11:12.240 --> 11:15.200]  20 different kinds of plants in the same room in a warehouse environment
[11:15.200 --> 11:19.880]  We're run 20 or 30 different strains in one room the aromas and flavors do not mix that way
[11:19.880 --> 11:23.960]  But when it comes to drying and curing I would keep them separate when you put them into
[11:24.200 --> 11:30.440]  Containers because that's when your aromas and flavors could get a little muddled be very careful with the drying and curing process
[11:30.440 --> 11:34.280]  That's where most of the flavor and aroma mistakes do occur
[11:34.400 --> 11:40.040]  I'm not gonna say your name, but that was a great question. My dude. Thank you for the patreon support. Let's keep it moving
[11:40.040 --> 11:44.720]  I've got two questions here that are going to segue us into a nice long
[11:45.160 --> 11:49.360]  Ramble here. I'm gonna read both of these messages and then I will kind of address them
[11:49.360 --> 11:55.040]  This one came from the patreon and it says yo Rasta Jeff. What episode can I hear more about?
[11:55.640 --> 11:59.680]  18-6 in late flower. I'm very interested in learning more. Thanks
[11:59.840 --> 12:04.360]  The answer to that one is this episode my dude I'm gonna talk about it in just a second
[12:04.360 --> 12:06.920]  There's another question. It says quick ish question
[12:07.080 --> 12:12.720]  Do you think plants finish more quickly in the last two weeks of flower if you switch to 18-6 or?
[12:14.080 --> 12:15.800]  1014 that's a very good question
[12:15.800 --> 12:19.280]  I think you once said reducing light helps them finish more quickly
[12:19.280 --> 12:25.480]  But in the most recent show you said 18-6 helps them finish more quickly. I was surprised to hear this
[12:25.480 --> 12:32.560]  I've done 18-6 many times and it definitely helps revenge and maybe more flower development but faster finish which is
[12:32.920 --> 12:38.800]  Faster. Thanks again for the great shows still hoping for more strain reviews. Don't worry my dude more strain reviews are coming
[12:38.800 --> 12:42.640]  But let's jump into this one for now. This is a good case of
[12:43.240 --> 12:48.720]  Me having been growing for quite a while. I've grown for a long time now. I've been in commercial environments
[12:48.720 --> 12:53.320]  I've been in home grows. I've been in giant grows and small grows have been intense. I've been in garages
[12:54.160 --> 12:56.920]  LEDs HPS every kind of lighting you could imagine
[12:57.560 --> 13:02.040]  One of the things to notice here is that I've changed I've adapted things
[13:02.040 --> 13:07.440]  I'm doing things differently than I have before don't be afraid to adjust and adapt and try new things
[13:07.800 --> 13:12.600]  So let's focus more on the main part of this question here. This is about light cycles
[13:12.600 --> 13:15.700]  The first question is talking more about 18-6 and late flower
[13:15.880 --> 13:20.200]  Then we hear another listener mentioned the 10 hours on and 14 hours off
[13:20.560 --> 13:24.120]  Let's talk a little bit about flowering cycles and flowering times
[13:24.300 --> 13:30.900]  Why we do the times we do and what we're hoping to achieve by altering these flowering cycles now most commonly
[13:30.900 --> 13:35.440]  We are using 12 hours on and 12 hours off to flower our plants
[13:35.440 --> 13:39.060]  We're doing 12 12 that is equal amount of on as off time
[13:39.160 --> 13:45.580]  The reason that we are running that 12 12 is because that's what we have noticed works for most plants
[13:45.580 --> 13:50.940]  This is what is called the critical period plants need a at a certain amount of dark time to initiate
[13:51.340 --> 13:57.700]  Flowering now some plants that may be 10 hours of darkness some plants that may be closer to 13 hours of darkness
[13:57.700 --> 14:03.360]  But what we have learned from what we are breeding from what we have bred for indoor use most of the plants
[14:03.360 --> 14:08.520]  We are working with flower very well with a 12 hour on and 12 hour off cycle
[14:08.540 --> 14:14.840]  So that works very well for most of the plants now a long time ago a breeder known as DJ short came and he taught
[14:15.040 --> 14:17.040]  That we can see more
[14:17.480 --> 14:24.120]  Phenotypical expression and more variation if we adjust our light timer to give those plants a little bit more darkness
[14:24.440 --> 14:32.320]  That extra hour of darkness will show you like I said a moment ago more phenotypical expression more variation in your plants
[14:32.600 --> 14:40.640]  Sometimes more aromas sometimes different aromas. So there are advantages to running an 11 on and 13 off cycle
[14:40.640 --> 14:43.760]  That's very similar to our 10 and 14, which our friend mentioned here
[14:44.240 --> 14:48.760]  11 13 10 14 very similar. We're going to get very similar results
[14:48.760 --> 14:53.200]  We're going to get very similar effects. The plants are going to get more sleeping time less daytime
[14:53.200 --> 14:56.760]  They'll be able to express their characteristics a little bit differently
[14:56.760 --> 15:01.040]  So we've got our basic 12 12 cycle that most people run we know that works
[15:01.040 --> 15:04.800]  That's been tried and true for most of the plants that we've been breeding for a few years
[15:04.800 --> 15:08.760]  We've been breeding indoors with these plants that works well for the stock. We have been working with
[15:09.200 --> 15:11.480]  We've adjusted our rooms to work with the plants
[15:11.480 --> 15:13.360]  We've adjusted the plants to work in our rooms
[15:13.360 --> 15:17.360]  Most things that take longer or shorter than that have simply been eliminated by breeders
[15:17.480 --> 15:19.920]  Most of the plants are gonna work in 12 12 now
[15:19.920 --> 15:25.520]  We've got our 11 13 or 10 14, which is going to show you a little bit more phenotypical expression
[15:25.520 --> 15:28.000]  now the new thing that I have been working with is
[15:28.240 --> 15:33.320]  I do 12 hours on and 12 hours off for most of the flowering cycle
[15:33.320 --> 15:38.360]  Just like most of you guys are doing then at the end of that cycle when I begin to flush my plants
[15:38.360 --> 15:43.720]  Which is a whole nother controversial topic, which we'll talk about in the future when I begin to flush my plants
[15:43.720 --> 15:45.720]  I will put my light cycle back on
[15:46.160 --> 15:52.440]  18 hours on and 6 hours off now that sounds crazy to a lot of people a lot of people have given me
[15:52.920 --> 15:55.360]  Negative feedback and a lot of criticism about that
[15:55.360 --> 16:00.120]  But guess what the people that said I'm crazy and that it's a fucked-up idea have never tried it
[16:00.120 --> 16:06.680]  They haven't done it because the only feedback I've gotten from people who do this is they say my buds finished more quickly and they're more
[16:06.680 --> 16:08.680]  Dense. Thank you. That was a great idea
[16:08.760 --> 16:15.200]  So I'm only getting negative feedback from people who refuse to try it. The people have tried it are liking the idea
[16:15.240 --> 16:19.920]  So why am I doing this? What is my my goal? What's my intention? What the fuck was I thinking?
[16:20.680 --> 16:27.200]  Light is the main source of energy for our plants. I am mostly making seeds in most of my runs
[16:27.200 --> 16:32.520]  I discovered that I can pollinate a plant after that pollination is successful
[16:32.520 --> 16:34.520]  I can put my light cycle back on
[16:34.760 --> 16:41.200]  18-6 and I can use my veg room as a veg room and I don't have to continue flowering plants in there to make those
[16:41.200 --> 16:48.520]  Seeds come to full maturation. My seeds will finish under a veg light. Those seeds will reach full maturation under that
[16:48.760 --> 16:53.240]  18-6 light. I'm not trying to grow flowers here. I was trying to make seeds in this run
[16:53.320 --> 16:55.960]  So I turned my light cycle back to 18-6
[16:55.960 --> 17:01.320]  I moved other plants into that room so that they could veg so I could have my next flower run ready and at the same
[17:01.320 --> 17:05.080]  Time I let those seeds harden up under 18 hours on and six off
[17:05.440 --> 17:09.820]  What I did notice was my buds where the seeds would be they looked like total shit
[17:09.820 --> 17:13.960]  But guess what? I did not care. I was not growing consumable smokeable buds
[17:13.960 --> 17:19.040]  I was solely focused on seed production. So I turned my lights on to 18-6
[17:19.040 --> 17:22.960]  I noticed my seeds were done a lot earlier than normal
[17:22.960 --> 17:29.280]  These seeds took about 10 to 14 days less time to finish than they normally did. I had more viable seeds
[17:29.280 --> 17:31.280]  I had a better average of germination
[17:31.280 --> 17:37.600]  I had thicker fatter better looking seeds from using the 18 on and six off light cycle
[17:37.600 --> 17:44.080]  My theory behind this is that light is the number one source of energy for my plant if I can feed that plant more light
[17:44.080 --> 17:48.800]  It will photosynthesize more it will metabolize more it will make bigger better
[17:49.200 --> 17:53.320]  Faster seeds and that is exactly what I achieved with that. I deal with that method
[17:53.360 --> 17:56.000]  So I thought since I'm doing this with my seeds
[17:56.000 --> 18:01.120]  Couldn't I increase my light time a little bit in my flower room and kind of bang them out make them a little more
[18:01.120 --> 18:02.960]  Dense get them out here a little bit quicker
[18:02.960 --> 18:06.160]  So I decided to try this when I started flushing
[18:06.680 --> 18:09.860]  Because we all know if we change the light cycle too early
[18:09.860 --> 18:15.880]  You do run the risk of re-vegging your plants that will happen if you let them go for too long
[18:16.040 --> 18:20.680]  With this cycle that is why I don't do this until I am flushing. I know it's the end
[18:20.840 --> 18:26.140]  We've got 10 maybe 12 maybe 14 days before I'm gonna cut them there will be no revenge
[18:26.520 --> 18:31.520]  Opportunity the hormones will not have that much time to shift over. It will not happen that quickly
[18:31.520 --> 18:36.960]  So what I would do when I begin to flush I simply adjust my timer to 18 hours on
[18:37.120 --> 18:41.640]  Six hours off and flush my plants then I pay close attention to the trichomes
[18:41.880 --> 18:45.680]  This is where it gets really important when the trichomes are ready cut down the plants
[18:45.680 --> 18:50.480]  You have to pay close attention because they're not going to be ready at the time. They were before they're gonna finish
[18:50.680 --> 18:52.680]  Sooner than they did last time
[18:52.960 --> 18:57.280]  They're also gonna be a little bit more dense. There's gonna be more weight to your product
[18:57.280 --> 18:59.760]  So it's gonna be more dense and it's gonna be done earlier
[18:59.840 --> 19:02.200]  Why wouldn't you want to do that in my opinion?
[19:02.200 --> 19:03.560]  That is a great thing to do
[19:03.560 --> 19:09.080]  Also, if you do want the idea of re-vegging that plant you've already sped up your re-vegging process
[19:09.080 --> 19:12.560]  You're 10 to 14 days ahead of the game of re-vegging that plant
[19:12.560 --> 19:16.940]  You can cut down the majority of the plant leave a couple of thumb sized nuggets and re-veg those
[19:16.940 --> 19:21.640]  You're already way ahead of the game because you've been on a re-veg light cycle for 10 days
[19:21.740 --> 19:27.180]  All right, so we have covered the three main light schedules, which I would work with. We've got 12 12
[19:27.220 --> 19:31.060]  We've got 11 13 and we've got 18 6 for the end of flower
[19:31.060 --> 19:37.300]  Now let's talk about why I would do each of those different cycles 12 12. That's basic. We know it works
[19:37.340 --> 19:41.300]  That's what most of my commercial rooms run on when they're in flower 12 12
[19:41.300 --> 19:46.920]  That's gonna work for almost everything that we have bred everything that's been designed to put in an indoor cultivation facility
[19:46.940 --> 19:50.340]  Now, let's talk about when I would use 11 on and 13 off
[19:50.900 --> 19:52.780]  11 on and 13 off is great
[19:52.780 --> 19:59.480]  Like I've said before for showing different characteristics of different phenotypes if I was doing a pheno hunt of a seed pack
[19:59.480 --> 20:06.740]  I may consider doing 11 on 13 off in my flowering cycle because I will see more variation more
[20:06.940 --> 20:10.860]  Specific characteristics of those phenotypes it allows the plants to express themselves
[20:11.260 --> 20:15.580]  Just a little bit more that extra hour of sleep lets them do different things
[20:15.580 --> 20:18.620]  Maybe one will get foxtail II one will get a little bit fingery
[20:18.620 --> 20:23.420]  Maybe one will turn purple you never know what it may do, but I see more variation
[20:23.420 --> 20:24.860]  So when I'm doing a pheno hunt
[20:24.860 --> 20:30.860]  I may do that 11 on and 13 off if I were running something from DJ short with the blueberry in it
[20:30.860 --> 20:37.300]  I may consider that 11 on 13 off flow responded very well to 11 on 13 off
[20:37.300 --> 20:41.400]  A lot of strains will like this some strains may not react as well
[20:41.600 --> 20:46.200]  But the only way to find that out is by growing the strain under that light cycle
[20:46.200 --> 20:51.840]  So I would do the first run when you grow something I would either do 12 12 or 11 13
[20:51.840 --> 20:57.200]  So the first time you run a pack of seeds either do that 12 12 or 11 13 both will be effective
[20:57.320 --> 21:01.000]  But you may see some differences in that 11 13
[21:01.000 --> 21:06.600]  I understand we can't all change our schedules our rooms that one hour may mess something up for you that one hour may throw
[21:06.600 --> 21:10.060]  Everything else in your schedule off. You might not be able to adjust timers
[21:10.060 --> 21:16.140]  I understand that but give it a run at 12 12 or 11 13 for the first time that you run a plant
[21:16.140 --> 21:17.740]  Let's talk about 18 6 now
[21:17.740 --> 21:25.340]  I never recommend running 18 hours on and 16 hours off on the first try that you grow any
[21:25.500 --> 21:28.460]  Plant ever don't do that. That's not my advice
[21:28.580 --> 21:33.180]  I want you to do that the second third maybe fourth time that you've run this cultivar
[21:33.340 --> 21:39.340]  Don't do it the first try the first try I always recommend doing that 12 12 or 11 13
[21:39.340 --> 21:43.340]  So we can see what the plant expresses then we'll learn the plant
[21:43.340 --> 21:45.180]  We'll see how long does it take to flower?
[21:45.180 --> 21:46.980]  When should I begin flushing?
[21:46.980 --> 21:52.460]  Then once you know when to begin flushing the next couple of times you run it you can decide that is when I want to
[21:52.460 --> 21:56.800]  Turn that plant to 18 6 don't do that on the first run. You don't know when to do it
[21:56.820 --> 22:02.060]  So the 12 12 works always commercial grows. I'll probably do 12 12 phenol hunts
[22:02.060 --> 22:07.500]  I'm gonna do 11 on 13 off the 18 6 comes in on that second or third run
[22:07.500 --> 22:10.340]  Don't do that on the first try we need to learn these plants
[22:10.380 --> 22:14.540]  Then I will do the 18 6 and I will see how the plants respond to that
[22:14.660 --> 22:16.820]  Like I said before some plants love it
[22:16.820 --> 22:23.020]  Some plants will not react well to it at all plants that naturally grow dense and they get big dense fat buds
[22:23.020 --> 22:28.660]  They're going to get more dense fat buds the buds that get a little bit larfy a little bit fluffy
[22:28.660 --> 22:33.020]  They will tend to dense up and get a little bit harder and pack on a little bit more weight
[22:33.180 --> 22:35.500]  Toward the end if you use that 18 6
[22:35.900 --> 22:42.300]  Another great advantage of the 18 6 is I think that they do finish a little bit early when you run that light cycle
[22:42.300 --> 22:48.360]  They're just metabolizing more. They're photosynthesizing more. They're able to speed up the process when they do sleep. They go
[22:48.360 --> 22:51.900]  Hey, I've only got a few hours. Let's get some shit done. So they speed up
[22:51.900 --> 22:57.220]  So that is part of why I recommend using that 18 6 light cycle not on the first run
[22:57.220 --> 23:00.660]  We need to find out how long to flower them on the first couple of runs
[23:00.700 --> 23:03.460]  Then we can play with the modified light cycle at the end
[23:03.460 --> 23:07.620]  So now let me back up and actually answer the main part of the question now that we understand these
[23:08.180 --> 23:13.660]  Optional light cycles. The main question was which is quicker 18 6 or 10 14?
[23:13.660 --> 23:18.820]  And again, I'm gonna recap and I'm gonna go right back to where I started with all this and I'm gonna say that's probably
[23:19.500 --> 23:23.380]  Strain-specific you're gonna get different results from each light cycle
[23:23.380 --> 23:26.200]  You're going to get sped up results from both light cycles
[23:26.200 --> 23:31.200]  But it's going to be plant specific on which works best for your plants
[23:31.200 --> 23:34.520]  I've never done 11 13 into 18 6
[23:34.520 --> 23:38.560]  I bet that would be extreme that extra hour going to the extra hours would be crazy
[23:38.720 --> 23:45.760]  I've always done 12 12 to 18 6, maybe try 11 13 to 18 6 at the end. See how that does for you, but
[23:46.560 --> 23:49.360]  Really? I'm not sure which light cycle is faster
[23:49.360 --> 23:53.960]  If you could do the 10 14 and then switch it to 18 6, you're gonna see huge results there
[23:53.960 --> 23:59.320]  But I have never done that so it's gonna be plant specific strain specific cultivar
[23:59.520 --> 24:03.160]  Possibly phenotype specific is going to be my answer for that one
[24:03.680 --> 24:07.720]  That message came from our friend Marco Esquim. Dolas. Ry-ry-ry
