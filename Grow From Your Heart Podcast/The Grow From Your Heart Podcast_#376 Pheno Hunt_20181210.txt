[00:00.000 --> 00:04.680]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community. It's time for episode 376 of the Grow From Your
[00:04.680 --> 00:09.080]  Heart podcast. This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company. If you
[00:09.080 --> 00:14.000]  need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and you can find
[00:14.000 --> 00:22.120]  them at www.dankseed.store. It has become a tradition that I start the podcast off by
[00:22.120 --> 00:27.000]  letting you know what I am smoking. I just took a dab of some strawberry diesel batter
[00:27.000 --> 00:35.240]  from Apothecary Farms. The label says it is 61.9% THC with a total of 73.7% cannabinoids.
[00:35.240 --> 00:39.200]  This stuff has a really funky, sort of a sour strawberry smell to it. It's definitely got
[00:39.200 --> 00:43.840]  the strawberries with a hint of diesel coming through the background. It tasted like strawberry
[00:43.840 --> 00:47.840]  incense, and I really liked the flavor. The flavor is just hanging out on my tongue. I
[00:47.840 --> 00:51.720]  could use a drink, but I don't want to drink anything to wipe that strawberry flavor off
[00:51.720 --> 00:54.920]  of my tongue. I want to let that linger as long as it can. So I'm really digging the
[00:54.920 --> 00:59.240]  flavor, and the high is nice. It goes straight to the brain. It's a nice high energy sort
[00:59.240 --> 01:03.720]  of a buzz. I really like the strawberry diesel batter from Apothecary Farms.
[01:03.720 --> 01:08.200]  All right, let's get right into the podcast. You guys, this is going to be another grow
[01:08.200 --> 01:11.400]  lesson. If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow
[01:11.400 --> 01:16.760]  lessons. This episode is going to be about pheno hunting. So far in my series of grow
[01:16.760 --> 01:20.760]  lessons, we have talked about setting a goal for our grow. We have chosen a wise spot for
[01:20.760 --> 01:24.520]  the grow. We have selected and purchased the proper equipment. We have set it up. We've
[01:24.520 --> 01:28.920]  tested it. We have actually sprouted seeds. We've acquired clones. We've got little baby
[01:28.920 --> 01:33.400]  plants going. We potted those into our three or five, maybe seven gallon pots. We are currently
[01:33.400 --> 01:38.040]  in the veg phase in my grow lessons. We have topped our plants. We've been doing lollipopping.
[01:38.040 --> 01:42.040]  We've been doing popping and twisting. We've got some canopy control techniques happening.
[01:42.040 --> 01:46.880]  We're almost ready to flower in my grow lessons. Before we get to the flowering phase, I feel
[01:46.880 --> 01:51.880]  like there are a few things we should understand. We need to know how to sex our plants. If
[01:51.880 --> 01:55.960]  you're growing from seed, you've got the opportunity to find males. Those plants won't
[01:55.960 --> 02:00.760]  reveal their sex until we are early in flower. We need to be able to identify the male plants
[02:00.760 --> 02:05.120]  so that we can remove them from the garden before they pollinate our females. Another
[02:05.120 --> 02:08.640]  thing we're going to talk about is selecting mother plants. We're going to do that through
[02:08.640 --> 02:14.120]  a pheno hunt. Let's jump right in to talking about a pheno hunt and what a pheno hunt is
[02:14.120 --> 02:19.480]  and what is the purpose of pheno hunting. Now, what do I mean by a pheno hunt? When
[02:19.480 --> 02:26.080]  I say a pheno hunt, I am referring to finding a desired phenotype from a package of seeds.
[02:26.080 --> 02:31.680]  Now, let's say you acquired a package of seeds from the Helladank Seed Company. I would recommend
[02:31.680 --> 02:36.160]  10 seeds for a pheno hunt. I do sell packs of five. I sell packs of five to make them
[02:36.160 --> 02:40.120]  attainable so that everybody can afford them. I understand not everybody can buy a 10-pack
[02:40.120 --> 02:44.920]  of seeds. I would recommend 10 seeds for a pheno hunt. In this situation, we're going
[02:44.920 --> 02:49.600]  to run 10 seeds. You just got a fresh 10-pack of Arise. You don't know what's in there.
[02:49.600 --> 02:55.320]  We need to find that phenotype that works best for you and your garden. So sifting through
[02:55.320 --> 02:59.440]  those seeds is a pheno hunt. We are going to grow them out and you are going to find
[02:59.440 --> 03:03.800]  the phenotype that works best for you, the phenotype that works best for your patients
[03:03.800 --> 03:08.520]  or your customers. Also, you need the phenotype that works best for your garden. So the goal
[03:08.520 --> 03:13.560]  here is to find a custom tailored phenotype out of this pack of seeds. So let's talk about
[03:13.560 --> 03:18.040]  a little bit how to do that. Doing a pheno hunt is one of my favorite things to do in
[03:18.040 --> 03:23.480]  a grow environment. I get to do a lot of observation. I get to find surprises. I may find the next
[03:23.480 --> 03:27.840]  best thing. I may find that next chem dog. I may find the next golden goat. I may find
[03:27.840 --> 03:32.400]  the next gorilla glue. I may find the next Girl Scout cookies. You never know what you
[03:32.400 --> 03:36.440]  could come up with in a pheno hunt. That is one of my favorite parts. It's like opening
[03:36.440 --> 03:41.240]  Christmas presents. You never know what is in that box. Suddenly, I want to make a Forrest
[03:41.240 --> 03:45.560]  Gump reference because you never know what you're going to get. So this is how I would
[03:45.560 --> 03:50.840]  do a pheno hunt. I would get a 10 pack of seeds. I would germinate those 10 seeds. I
[03:50.840 --> 03:56.000]  would carefully make sure that every one of those plants is treated the exact same. I
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.080]  would put them all in the same medium, the same pot. I would feed them the same thing.
[04:00.080 --> 04:03.800]  They would go under the same light and they would be all in the same environment because
[04:03.800 --> 04:08.640]  I don't want any variation. I want all of these seedlings to get the same opportunity
[04:08.640 --> 04:13.840]  to show me the same potential. So I germinate these seeds. I get them into pots. I get
[04:13.840 --> 04:19.560]  them going. I veg them. I start taking notes on these plants very early. I label them 1
[04:19.560 --> 04:24.120]  through 10. So I've got whatever the strain is. We're going to say a rise 1, a rise 2,
[04:24.120 --> 04:27.800]  all the way up to number 10. I'm going to pay attention to these plants and take a lot
[04:27.800 --> 04:32.680]  of notes. If I see anything weird, I'm going to document that. If I get a plant that's
[04:32.680 --> 04:36.600]  just growing like shit, it's not keeping up, it's having problems, it gets pulled out of
[04:36.600 --> 04:40.840]  there. I don't want to keep a shitty plant around. There's no reason to have a shitty
[04:40.840 --> 04:45.220]  plant when you can pheno hunt seeds and find a keeper. So I'll pay close attention to my
[04:45.220 --> 04:50.080]  plants as they grow. I'll take a lot of notes and veg. If I top the plants, if I lollipop
[04:50.080 --> 04:55.060]  the plants, I make sure to do it equally across the board. I want all 10 of these seedlings
[04:55.060 --> 04:59.300]  to get the same treatment. Again, we want them all to have the same potential. We're
[04:59.300 --> 05:04.060]  trying to audition these to find the best one for our situation. So if you give them
[05:04.060 --> 05:07.240]  different treatment, they're going to come out differently. How do you know what the
[05:07.240 --> 05:13.460]  best one is? They all need to be treated equally in my opinion. So I grow these plants out.
[05:13.460 --> 05:19.420]  As soon as they're big enough, I take a clone. I am confident in my cloning skills. 99.9%
[05:19.420 --> 05:23.860]  of my clones will survive. If you are not confident in your clone skills, I suggest
[05:23.860 --> 05:29.620]  you take 2, maybe 3, maybe 5 clones from each plant. So let them get large enough to provide
[05:29.620 --> 05:34.900]  the amount of clones you need. Get a clone from each plant. Carefully label your clones.
[05:34.900 --> 05:41.340]  You will have Arise number 1, Arise number 2. You should have clone Arise 1, clone Arise
[05:41.340 --> 05:47.000]  2. Carefully label them. This will be very important in the future. This is your reserve.
[05:47.000 --> 05:51.340]  This is how you are going to keep your plants around. This is going to segue into selecting
[05:51.340 --> 05:54.900]  a mother plant. This is how we're going to have a mother plant to keep these genetics
[05:54.900 --> 06:00.420]  around forever so you can continue to produce this select phenotype until the end of time.
[06:00.420 --> 06:04.500]  That clone that we labeled is going to become your future mother plant. So make sure it
[06:04.500 --> 06:09.300]  is labeled accurately. So again, we label them Arise 1, Arise 2, all the way up to Arise
[06:09.300 --> 06:14.980]  number 10. Then we also label the clones A1, A2, A all the way up to number 10. So we've
[06:14.980 --> 06:19.100]  got the clone donor and the corresponding clones properly labeled. There's no confusion
[06:19.100 --> 06:23.180]  there. You guys, I have done a complete episode on cutting clones. So if you need help cutting
[06:23.180 --> 06:29.420]  your clones, I recommend episode number 346 for an in-depth lesson on cutting clones.
[06:29.420 --> 06:33.980]  And if you want a really in-depth talk about mother plants, check out episode 315. That
[06:33.980 --> 06:37.560]  one will teach you all about healthy and happy mother plants.
[06:37.560 --> 06:42.180]  The goal here is to get a clone off of each of these seedlings before we put them into
[06:42.180 --> 06:47.340]  flower. That way, when we find the champion out of this batch, we've got a clone of that
[06:47.340 --> 06:51.860]  so that we can continue to grow that clone forever. You keep that one clone alive as
[06:51.860 --> 06:55.900]  a mother plant. You never flower it out and you can cut clones from that as long as you
[06:55.900 --> 06:59.940]  keep it healthy. So it's always there to give you clones. You have now got a mother plant
[06:59.940 --> 07:06.180]  from your pheno hunt. That is your custom phenotype that is for you. Maybe you like
[07:06.180 --> 07:10.580]  the more sativa dominant phenotype. Maybe you like the phenotype that smells more like
[07:10.580 --> 07:14.500]  golden goat. Maybe you like the phenotype that smells more like dirty feet. Maybe you
[07:14.500 --> 07:17.900]  need the one that finishes quicker. Maybe you're the kind of person that likes to let
[07:17.900 --> 07:23.060]  them flower for a really long time. That's up to you. You get to find that one that works
[07:23.060 --> 07:27.580]  best for you in your grow. If you get a clone, you've got a clone that all of your other
[07:27.580 --> 07:31.700]  friends have. Everybody's grown it. Everybody in the neighborhood has it. Everybody has
[07:31.700 --> 07:36.340]  smoked it. There's nothing setting you apart from the competition if you were growing for
[07:36.340 --> 07:38.100]  a retail market purpose.
[07:38.100 --> 07:42.540]  So growing from seed, you could find gold. Growing from seed, you can also find that
[07:42.540 --> 07:46.700]  custom phenotype that works for you, that works for your garden, and that works for
[07:46.700 --> 07:51.500]  the market. And honestly, when you're growing from seed, I always recommend taking a clone
[07:51.500 --> 07:56.160]  because who knows what you've got. What if you grow from seed and you find the most amazing
[07:56.160 --> 07:59.740]  product you've ever found and you don't have a clone? You're going to be heartbroken. You're
[07:59.740 --> 08:04.220]  going to try to revege it, which is a whole other podcast. That's a pain in the ass. But
[08:04.220 --> 08:07.280]  if you have got a clone, it's already ready to go.
[08:07.280 --> 08:11.860]  If you cut a clone before you put your plants into flower, that clone is going to go into
[08:11.860 --> 08:16.440]  a pot about two weeks later. Then it'll be ready to go into another pot a couple of weeks
[08:16.440 --> 08:21.520]  later. You can cut a bunch more clones off of that and have that ready to go by the time
[08:21.520 --> 08:26.280]  that first crop is finished. So you will have decided which one is the keeper probably around
[08:26.280 --> 08:31.080]  week seven or eight, and you can take a bunch of clones and have them ready almost on time
[08:31.080 --> 08:35.240]  to fill that room when you cut down from the pheno hunt. And you don't have to skip any
[08:35.240 --> 08:37.800]  time. It helps you move along quite quickly.
[08:37.800 --> 08:42.200]  So now our original plants have grown out nice and large. We have got clones from everything.
[08:42.200 --> 08:46.440]  They are properly labeled. We are confident that at least one of those clones from each
[08:46.440 --> 08:52.320]  phenotype is going to root. Then it is time to flower my pheno hunt. That's when the fun
[08:52.320 --> 08:57.680]  begins. We can tell a lot about our plants during the veg cycle. We can tell if you like
[08:57.680 --> 09:01.840]  the growth structure, if you like the node spacing, if you like the leaf size, that's
[09:01.840 --> 09:06.480]  going to indicate a lot of things. The real things we want to see will not reveal themselves
[09:06.480 --> 09:08.200]  until they are in flower.
[09:08.200 --> 09:13.120]  So early in flower, the first things we need to pay attention to, we need to look for males.
[09:13.120 --> 09:17.160]  If you are growing from seed, you have got the opportunity to have males pop up in your
[09:17.160 --> 09:23.400]  garden even if you are running feminized seeds. Not all feminized seed makers make seeds the
[09:23.400 --> 09:28.960]  same way. Some feminized seeds were made with poor practices. Some feminized seeds were
[09:28.960 --> 09:34.160]  made without auditioning the parrot plants properly before breeding with them. You still
[09:34.280 --> 09:41.160]  may find males or intersex traits in feminized seeds. Just because the package says feminized
[09:41.160 --> 09:46.640]  doesn't mean you can get lazy and stop paying attention. So we need to look for males or
[09:46.640 --> 09:53.320]  hermaphrodites in our garden early in flower. I would start looking day 3, day 4, day 5.
[09:53.320 --> 09:57.680]  You are going to start seeing signs of male preflower. As soon as you are certain that
[09:57.680 --> 10:03.040]  that plant is a male, it needs to come out of the garden. We do not want boys in there.
[10:03.040 --> 10:06.800]  The girls are going to start developing pistils. They will be able to receive pollen. When
[10:06.800 --> 10:10.560]  those males drop pollen, they are going to seed your plant. We need to get the boys out
[10:10.560 --> 10:15.840]  as soon as possible. I do plan to talk more in depth about sexing our plants in a future
[10:15.840 --> 10:20.380]  episode when we get into the flowering phase, but quickly, let's talk about identifying
[10:20.380 --> 10:25.760]  a male and a female cannabis plant early in flower. When I am trying to identify the sex
[10:25.760 --> 10:31.060]  of a cannabis plant, there are two spots I like to look and I find those spots very reliable.
[10:31.060 --> 10:35.960]  The very tip top bud will be the first spot to show you sex when you throw those plants
[10:35.960 --> 10:41.260]  into flower. Also, lower on the plant where you have an intersection, you have the little
[10:41.260 --> 10:45.040]  peace sign. You have two branches coming off and you have the main stalk coming up. Right
[10:45.040 --> 10:49.580]  there at that intersection, it loves to tell you if it is a boy or a girl. So a few days
[10:49.580 --> 10:54.740]  into flower, our plants will start giving us signs of male or female sex. If you grab
[10:54.740 --> 10:58.660]  a branch and look closely, there will be the main branch coming up, then there will be
[10:58.660 --> 11:03.980]  a little shoot coming off of that. Where that shoot splits off, there will be signs
[11:03.980 --> 11:09.260]  of sex right at that intersection. Right inside of that little V, there will be signs of sex.
[11:09.260 --> 11:14.060]  If you see a wart-like thing popping up right there, if you see a little tiny acorn popping
[11:14.060 --> 11:19.300]  up right there, if it's got a ball coming out of there, that is probably a male plant.
[11:19.300 --> 11:23.780]  If it looks like it's got a hair coming out, just one little pistol, maybe two little pistol
[11:23.780 --> 11:29.220]  hairs doing a peace sign, that is a female. So at the intersections, at the nodes, you
[11:29.220 --> 11:34.180]  will see either little hairs coming out or you may see what looks like balls. Now be
[11:34.180 --> 11:38.300]  careful in early flower because sometimes those little balls are actually calyxes and
[11:38.300 --> 11:44.100]  it can be confusing. So if you have identified something that you think may be a male flower,
[11:44.100 --> 11:49.300]  mark that plant. Say, arise number seven, looks like it could be a boy, write that down
[11:49.300 --> 11:52.940]  somewhere, and then every day when you go in that garden, head right over to number
[11:52.940 --> 11:58.020]  seven and look at the progress. If those balls that are on the plant start drooping
[11:58.020 --> 12:02.180]  and hanging down, that is definitely a male. It's growing a set of balls. You need to get
[12:02.180 --> 12:07.900]  that boy out of there. If that ball starts putting out a long hair, that is a calyx and
[12:07.900 --> 12:12.100]  you've got a female plant. Up toward the top of the plant, we should see a little bit of
[12:12.100 --> 12:16.820]  production. You will either see buds that look like dandelions. Those are your girls.
[12:16.820 --> 12:21.060]  If they're getting hairs, the white furry pistols are popping out, those are females.
[12:21.060 --> 12:25.600]  That's what you want. If it looks like you're making little sets of bananas up at the top,
[12:25.600 --> 12:29.100]  those are your boy plants. We need to get rid of those. It may look like you've got
[12:29.100 --> 12:34.380]  a little bud that is already loaded up with seeds. Those are not seeds. Those are pollen
[12:34.380 --> 12:38.820]  sacks. We need to get that boy out of the room immediately.
[12:38.820 --> 12:45.120]  I can only describe males and females so much through words with a podcast. It is your responsibility
[12:45.120 --> 12:50.180]  as a ganja farmer to Google what a male and female cannabis plant look like. You need
[12:50.300 --> 12:55.660]  some images. Get ahead of yourself. Go look before you put your plants into flower. Do
[12:55.660 --> 13:01.180]  not make the mistake of thinking, I can identify a male plant and then let that male go. By
[13:01.180 --> 13:06.020]  day 10, day 14, he's going to be dropping pollen and you're going to have a pollinated
[13:06.020 --> 13:10.700]  crop. If you're a new grower, that is very discouraging. Everything just went to shit.
[13:10.700 --> 13:14.960]  Your main goal is to produce a crop with no seeds. You just reduced potency. You just
[13:14.960 --> 13:19.780]  reduced harvest weight. You definitely reduced retail value. Everything is not how you want
[13:19.780 --> 13:26.420]  it if you've got seeds in there. Be very careful to get the boys out very, very early.
[13:26.420 --> 13:30.900]  If you were observing your plants and your plants show ball sacks and they show hairs,
[13:30.900 --> 13:36.200]  they need to go immediately. Those are hermaphrodite plants. I know it's 2018 and we're supposed
[13:36.200 --> 13:41.180]  to be acceptable. I do not accept hermaphroditic plants in my garden for any reason. They must
[13:41.180 --> 13:46.180]  go. We're trying to produce high-grade seedless cannabis and a hermaphrodite plant is going
[13:46.180 --> 13:50.580]  to ruin our whole goal of a seedless garden. So get rid of the males and get rid of the
[13:50.580 --> 13:55.080]  hermaphrodites. If you are not sure if that plant is a male or a hermaphrodite, pay very
[13:55.080 --> 13:59.580]  close attention to it. Keep an eye on that part you think may be a male part. It will
[13:59.580 --> 14:03.860]  start to open up. It will start to hang. It will give you plenty of warning that it wants
[14:03.860 --> 14:06.660]  to release pollen. Pay close attention.
[14:06.660 --> 14:10.220]  Now once you've culled your boys and you think you are past the part of the plants revealing
[14:10.220 --> 14:15.500]  sex, if you were growing from seed, you still need to pay attention for hermaphrodites.
[14:15.500 --> 14:21.260]  It is not uncommon for things to reveal intersex traits late in flower, sometime around week
[14:21.260 --> 14:26.660]  7 or week 8 or especially week 9 and if you push them real hard, it's way likely to see
[14:26.660 --> 14:32.580]  them toward week 10. So pay attention to the hermaphrodite traits in your plants.
[14:32.580 --> 14:37.540]  If a plant shows herm late in flower, you've got some considerations to make. If it didn't
[14:37.540 --> 14:42.700]  pop up until week 9, that may be okay. If that weed is fire, if you just produced some
[14:42.700 --> 14:47.660]  amazing product and that plant herms late in the bloom cycle, that may be okay. We're
[14:47.660 --> 14:51.820]  going to cut the plants down before that hermaphrodite is able to cause us any problems.
[14:51.820 --> 14:58.220]  Also, a lot of the hermaphrodite plants that show intersex traits late in flower produce
[14:58.220 --> 15:02.180]  sterile male flowers. They won't even produce pollen that can pollinate a room. It will
[15:02.180 --> 15:06.620]  pop out a couple of nanners and they'll dry up immediately. They won't ever produce pollen.
[15:06.620 --> 15:10.460]  So that is up to you. If you get a plant that does hermaphrodite late in flower, if it's
[15:10.460 --> 15:15.440]  not going to cause problems and it produces amazing product, it may be worth keeping around.
[15:15.440 --> 15:19.900]  That is something for you to consider. Also, if you ever share that clone with people,
[15:19.900 --> 15:24.060]  maybe let them know, hey bro, at the end of week 9, this one might throw a couple of nanners
[15:24.060 --> 15:29.140]  on you. As an experienced grower, that's something I'm familiar with. That's something I'm comfortable
[15:29.140 --> 15:34.620]  with. That's something I can deal with. Very many of the chem dog derived strains will
[15:34.620 --> 15:39.460]  herm on you if you let them go past nine weeks. That is not rare. If you let it go too long,
[15:39.460 --> 15:43.740]  it'll throw out a couple of nanners, but those nanners don't contain any pollen. They
[15:43.740 --> 15:47.260]  will not pollinate anything. They'll just pop up a couple of male bananas right at the
[15:47.260 --> 15:50.700]  end. So the way to solve that, either cut it down right before that happens, because
[15:50.700 --> 15:55.180]  I know when it happens, it happens at day 70. So cut them down about day 68. Everything
[15:55.180 --> 15:59.880]  should be cool. And I've also grown that plant enough to know that those male flowers don't
[15:59.880 --> 16:04.340]  produce any pollen. So even if I do let it finish, if I let it go 70, 72 days, it's still
[16:04.340 --> 16:08.780]  not going to cause a problem. And even if they did spit out pollen, I'm 72 days in a
[16:09.100 --> 16:12.220]  year, there's no time for anything to happen. All of my pistils have been shriveled up by
[16:12.220 --> 16:16.300]  then. There's nowhere for that pollen to be received. So you have things to consider if
[16:16.300 --> 16:21.220]  your plants are hermaphroditing late in flower. If it's early in flower, cull them, get rid
[16:21.220 --> 16:25.780]  of them. If it's an obvious hermaphrodite, toss it. If you've just got one flower late
[16:25.780 --> 16:29.900]  in, I would think about it. Now, if you've got one hermaphrodite flower late in, and
[16:29.900 --> 16:34.140]  that plant is only a six on a scale of 10, you still cull it. If you've got a nine or
[16:34.140 --> 16:37.860]  a 10 and a hermaphrodite flower, that's when you consider. You're like, is it worth that
[16:37.940 --> 16:43.140]  one herm or not? But that is a grower's decision to make. So that is a quick rant on sexing
[16:43.140 --> 16:46.940]  your plants. I do plan on going into more depth on that in a future episode. You are
[16:46.940 --> 16:51.900]  looking for the little hairs or the balls. If it's got balls, it's got to go. If it's
[16:51.900 --> 16:57.180]  got hairs and balls, it definitely has to go. Now, once we cull the males and the potential
[16:57.180 --> 17:02.900]  hermaphrodites, you have probably got 40 to 60% of your remaining stock. Cannabis plants
[17:02.900 --> 17:09.060]  average about 50% male and 50% female. So by day 14, you have probably eliminated 40
[17:09.060 --> 17:14.020]  to 60% of the room. If you started with 10 seeds, you were probably down to about five.
[17:14.020 --> 17:18.900]  You may have six, you may have four. I'm going to go with five for the rest of this lesson.
[17:18.900 --> 17:22.380]  So we've got five plants. They're in their finishing pots. They're about two weeks into
[17:22.380 --> 17:25.380]  flower. We've pulled out all the males. We've pulled out all the hermaphrodites. We are
[17:25.380 --> 17:31.540]  still paying attention for intersex traits. We're also keeping a lot of notes. Write down
[17:31.540 --> 17:35.460]  everything you feed these plants. Write down everything you spray on these plants. Write
[17:35.460 --> 17:40.340]  down the reactions of the plants to those procedures. If you see one plant do something
[17:40.340 --> 17:45.060]  different than all of the others as a reaction to something you did, document that. That
[17:45.060 --> 17:49.500]  may mean a lot to you in the future. Let's say that plant one and plant five become the
[17:49.500 --> 17:54.220]  two best keepers out of this phenol hunt, and you need to narrow it down to one. Maybe
[17:54.220 --> 17:58.500]  that weird note you wrote about plant number one will be the reason you cull that one and
[17:58.500 --> 18:02.420]  the reason you keep number five. So keep a lot of notes.
[18:02.420 --> 18:06.740]  So I do plan to do in-depth lessons on each week of the bloom cycle. I'm going to break
[18:06.740 --> 18:11.140]  it down into trimesters. We'll do weeks one through three, four through six, and seven
[18:11.140 --> 18:15.260]  through nine. And we'll talk about that in depth. We're going to fast forward a little
[18:15.260 --> 18:19.580]  bit through the grow cycle here in the phenotype talk, and we're going to get toward the end
[18:19.580 --> 18:24.540]  of the harvest. During the grow phase, during the bloom phase, our plants got the same exact
[18:24.540 --> 18:27.980]  treatment. We've only got five of them. It should have been fairly easy to treat them
[18:27.980 --> 18:32.100]  all the same. They got the same amount of light. They got the same amount of lollipopping,
[18:32.100 --> 18:36.300]  the same type of pruning, the same type of topping, the exact same feedings, the exact
[18:36.300 --> 18:40.860]  same pest management, the exact same foliar feedings. You get my point. We treated them
[18:40.860 --> 18:45.460]  all the same so that we can see reliable outcomes from each seedling.
[18:45.460 --> 18:52.140]  Now just like any crop, make sure you flush for 10 to 14 days before harvest. Then harvest.
[18:52.140 --> 18:57.620]  I have done a long and in-depth episode on harvesting and drying and curing our plants.
[18:57.620 --> 19:01.660]  If you need tips on drying and curing your freshly harvested cannabis plants, I recommend
[19:01.660 --> 19:08.260]  you listen to episode 326 titled Drying and Curing. I will give you a detailed step-by-step
[19:08.260 --> 19:12.460]  lesson on drying and curing your freshly harvested cannabis.
[19:12.460 --> 19:16.100]  You've got to grow it. You've got to flower it. Then you've got to flush it. Then harvest
[19:16.100 --> 19:20.780]  it. Then dry it and cure it and trim it. Guess what you get to do next? You get to have a
[19:20.780 --> 19:25.040]  smoke party. Depending on how much you grew, depending on how many people you trust and
[19:25.040 --> 19:31.020]  how many friends you've got, you get to have a few people come over and test your phenohunt.
[19:31.020 --> 19:35.280]  This is one of the most fun and rewarding parts of growing cannabis. You started with
[19:35.280 --> 19:40.160]  10 seeds about 120 days ago, and now you've got a small group of close friends at your
[19:40.160 --> 19:45.240]  house helping you narrow it down to decide what plant is going to be part of your future
[19:45.240 --> 19:46.240]  grow.
[19:46.240 --> 19:50.000]  Now when you and your friends are narrowing down which phenotype to select, you get to
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.800]  make the final decision. Don't let anybody sway you on the final decision because you
[19:53.840 --> 19:59.600]  are the grower. You are the one doing the work. This is your art. You get to decide.
[19:59.600 --> 20:03.280]  But what I like to do is after everything is dried and cured and we're ready to smoke
[20:03.280 --> 20:07.920]  it, I get Mike over, I get Kevin over, I bring a couple other folks over, and I give them
[20:07.920 --> 20:11.800]  five little buds. And if we've got time to do it, we'll smoke them all right here. We'll
[20:11.800 --> 20:15.160]  just take a couple bong rips of each or whatever and see what it all tastes like, see what
[20:15.160 --> 20:18.320]  it smells like, and look for what you're looking for.
[20:18.320 --> 20:21.760]  Are you looking for flavor? Are you looking for a specific aroma? Are you looking for
[20:21.760 --> 20:26.520]  a specific effect? Are you looking for bag appeal? If you're growing, like I said earlier,
[20:26.520 --> 20:30.760]  if you are a retail market grower, you're probably going for some bag appeal. You're
[20:30.760 --> 20:33.000]  going to need the buds that look the best.
[20:33.000 --> 20:37.480]  Also, you may want something that is unique. If you've got something that smells like oranges
[20:37.480 --> 20:41.680]  or strawberries or blueberries, we've all got that. If you've got something that smells
[20:41.680 --> 20:46.560]  like oranges and gas and cherries and dirty feet and gets you high as fuck and finishes
[20:46.560 --> 20:51.520]  in 60 days, you just found gold, that is probably the one you want to keep.
[20:51.560 --> 20:55.520]  So find the one that works best for you. Let your friends do a little tasting and let them
[20:55.520 --> 21:00.360]  kind of vote on it. They may agree, they may not. Decide what works best for you. It's
[21:00.360 --> 21:04.280]  just great to have input from your friends and it's always a good time to have a little
[21:04.280 --> 21:07.040]  pheno hunt party with the crew.
[21:07.040 --> 21:12.360]  So here's a quick breakdown of a pheno hunt. The main point is to find the outlier in a
[21:12.360 --> 21:19.080]  population of seeds. We do so by germinating a batch of seeds. In that process, we remove
[21:19.120 --> 21:24.480]  the problematic plants, which may be males, hermaphrodites, or mutants. Then we take clones
[21:24.480 --> 21:28.640]  before we flower our plants. We carefully label those plants to match the clones. So
[21:28.640 --> 21:33.040]  we've got plant one and clone one, plant two and clone two. That way, when we're done,
[21:33.040 --> 21:36.480]  we've got mother plants. We're going to talk about that a little more in just a second.
[21:36.480 --> 21:42.080]  So we've popped seeds, we've removed the problems, we've got clones. Now we flower out our plants.
[21:42.080 --> 21:48.120]  In that process, take a lot of notes so you know what you did. We are cannabis consumers.
[21:48.120 --> 21:52.760]  We may have fuzzy memories. I like to smoke before I work in the garden. Sometimes I may
[21:52.760 --> 21:58.200]  forget some details. That's why I write down everything. That notepad isn't going to forget
[21:58.200 --> 22:02.840]  anything. That Google document won't forget anything. My high ass will probably forget
[22:02.840 --> 22:06.000]  a couple of details. Write your shit down.
[22:06.000 --> 22:11.160]  So finish the crop. Get it all the way to the end. Flush it. Harvest. Dry and cure.
[22:11.160 --> 22:15.500]  Do a little smoke test with your friends. Decide which one you like the best. What works
[22:15.500 --> 22:19.260]  for your garden? What works for you? What works for your clientele? Are you growing
[22:19.260 --> 22:24.020]  for a medical patient? What works best for them? When I get the opportunity, I like to
[22:24.020 --> 22:29.140]  send my finished products to a lab for testing. You would be surprised at how many plants
[22:29.140 --> 22:33.820]  we select as the keeper that are not the highest tester in the batch. Sometimes the highest
[22:33.820 --> 22:37.780]  tester isn't the one with the best flavor. Sometimes the one with the highest test does
[22:37.780 --> 22:42.920]  not bring the best high when you smoke it. Sometimes those lab results are impressive,
[22:42.920 --> 22:48.680]  but we did not choose the one that gave us the best results based on our smoke test.
[22:48.680 --> 22:52.880]  Sometimes we did choose the one that matches up with the test, but not always. And it's
[22:52.880 --> 22:57.340]  more common that we don't agree with the lab test is which one is our keeper. Another thing
[22:57.340 --> 23:01.160]  you're going to find when you do a pheno hunt, you will find two that you really, really
[23:01.160 --> 23:05.160]  want to keep. There'll be one that smells real well and smokes real well and gets you
[23:05.160 --> 23:09.320]  super high. And there'll be one that does all of that pretty well, but it harvests way
[23:09.320 --> 23:13.360]  better. Being a grower, that's always hard to decide. I always keep the one that smokes
[23:13.360 --> 23:17.240]  better. We can just grow more next month. Try not to select because it's pretty. Try
[23:17.240 --> 23:23.560]  not to select because it harvests the most. Try to select based on effect, based on potency,
[23:23.560 --> 23:28.320]  based on desirability, based on marketability. There's enough bullshit out there that looks
[23:28.320 --> 23:32.640]  really good on Instagram and doesn't smoke worth a shit. So even if your plants aren't
[23:32.640 --> 23:37.400]  super photogenic, if they do what you need when you smoke them, when you and your market
[23:37.440 --> 23:41.600]  consume them, that's exactly what you're aiming for. So that is the phenotype you want to
[23:41.600 --> 23:47.320]  find. Find the one that works best for you. That is a custom phenotype for you, your clientele,
[23:47.320 --> 23:48.320]  and your garden.
[23:48.320 --> 23:52.600]  Now, earlier I mentioned mother plants. We took clones off of these plants before we
[23:52.600 --> 23:57.000]  flowered them. So in a grow room somewhere, we've got five plants just hanging out. They're
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.300]  in veg. Maybe you were proactive. Maybe you decided around week seven that you really
[24:01.300 --> 24:05.000]  liked Arise number three. So you went in there and you found that Arise mother plant number
[24:05.000 --> 24:08.640]  three and you took 10 clones. They're already vegging. They're getting big so that as soon
[24:08.640 --> 24:12.160]  as you harvest, you can throw those plants in there and you can run Arise number three
[24:12.160 --> 24:17.760]  again. Maybe you were waiting for this smoke test to find out which one to run again. Either
[24:17.760 --> 24:22.280]  way, you have got that number that you decide. That plant is hanging out in the veg room.
[24:22.280 --> 24:25.760]  It's in there. You just got to go get it and take a bunch of clones off of it and run it
[24:25.760 --> 24:30.820]  again. If you narrowed it down to two that you like, cut a few clones off of each one,
[24:30.820 --> 24:35.140]  run them again side by side. Now you've got a larger batch of each one to decide from.
[24:35.140 --> 24:38.980]  You can run it again, maybe change the nutrients, maybe change something in the room and see
[24:38.980 --> 24:42.900]  if the two phenotypes do something different with different environments. Maybe that will
[24:42.900 --> 24:46.820]  help you decide on which one to keep. Either way you choose to do it, after your tasting
[24:46.820 --> 24:50.980]  party with your friends, you have got that backup plant in the veg room. You've got Arise
[24:50.980 --> 24:54.780]  number three just over there waiting to take a bunch of clones so you can grow it again
[24:54.780 --> 24:59.660]  forever. Now the thing is, keep that plant alive. Listen to that episode about mother
[24:59.660 --> 25:03.460]  plants. Then you can keep that Arise number three around forever. You can have reliable,
[25:03.460 --> 25:07.100]  consistent medicine that works for you, that works for your garden, and your people will
[25:07.100 --> 25:10.260]  learn to rely on you for that product.
[25:10.260 --> 25:13.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is my quick talk on pheno hunting. I hope I made that nice
[25:13.740 --> 25:17.300]  and clear for you. Pheno hunting is one of my favorite things to do in a grow. That's
[25:17.300 --> 25:21.100]  always a great time. You get some seeds, you get to find out what's in there, you narrow
[25:21.100 --> 25:24.640]  it down to one, and then a guy like me, as soon as you're down to that one, you start
[25:24.640 --> 25:28.940]  another pheno hunt. Then I'm always adding a new one and pulling an old one out of the
[25:28.940 --> 25:31.540]  garden. There's always something coming in and something going out so that I've always
[25:31.540 --> 25:33.540]  got some fresh stuff in my grows.

[26:40.980 --> 26:45.980]  me questions. I rack my brain and try to answer right there in the Live feed. So join me on
[26:45.980 --> 26:52.700]  Instagram. I use my seed company. I'm Irie underscore genetics. I-R-I-E underscore genetics
[26:52.700 --> 26:56.700]  on Instagram. Give me a follow. I just may follow you back.
[26:56.700 --> 26:59.500]  If you've got something you'd like to say, you'd like to reach out and you're not into
[26:59.500 --> 27:02.940]  all of the social media, maybe you've got a product you'd like me to review, maybe you'd
[27:02.940 --> 27:07.700]  like to sponsor the podcast, you can send me an email. My email address is growfromyourheart
[27:07.700 --> 27:12.300]  at hotmail.com, and I would love to hear from you. Don't forget that the podcast is available
[27:12.300 --> 27:17.540]  on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, and YouTube. Find the show where you can listen, give us
[27:17.540 --> 27:21.580]  a subscribe, and make sure that you don't miss an episode. I want to thank you guys
[27:21.580 --> 27:26.620]  again for listening to episode 376 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. I'll be back
[27:26.620 --> 27:30.580]  Thursday with a fresh new episode. I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Eric
[27:30.580 --> 27:35.300]  in Massachusetts. And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
