[00:19.130 --> 00:30.140]  Yeah, what's up, cannabis community? It's time for episode 52 of the Grow From Your
[00:30.140 --> 00:35.380]  Heart podcast. You're a source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. If you're
[00:35.380 --> 00:39.740]  a new grower or a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber, if
[00:39.740 --> 00:43.420]  you're a cannabis activist, or if you're just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:43.420 --> 00:47.060]  this my friends is the podcast for you. Thanks for joining me. I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:47.060 --> 00:51.460]  I want to send a huge thanks to the Mystic Roots Band. Thanks a lot for letting me play
[00:51.460 --> 00:54.980]  your music on the show, guys. You're listening to the Mystic Roots Band. The song is DJing
[00:54.980 --> 00:59.220]  a dance, the instrumental version. The intro I usually play is called the Doggy Dub. I
[00:59.220 --> 01:04.020]  wanted to switch it up, bring some spice to your life. Variety is the spice of life. So
[01:04.020 --> 01:07.180]  big shout out to Cat and Coot from the Mystic Roots Band. How are you guys doing? Thanks
[01:07.180 --> 01:12.340]  for joining me. Coming to you on, today was our good friend, Jesse's birthday, and it
[01:12.340 --> 01:17.420]  was also cousin Tater's birthday. So I just got home from Jesse and Tater's birthday party.
[01:18.420 --> 01:22.940]  That was a fun party. I am not an alcohol drinker, so I left when the alcohol got a
[01:22.940 --> 01:27.660]  little heavy, but we retreated back to the Garden of Whedon and Spence and Maddie and
[01:27.660 --> 01:32.900]  Michael and Big Mike and myself and Joe hung out and took some dabs after the rest of the
[01:32.900 --> 01:37.420]  party. But man, big shout out to Jesse and Tater. I keep calling you Tater, dude. Your
[01:37.420 --> 01:40.900]  name's Jason. What's up, cousin Tater and Uncle Jesse. Happy birthday, you guys. I hope
[01:40.900 --> 01:45.540]  you had as much fun as I did. Thanks for bringing me to your party. Also, huge, huge shout out
[01:45.540 --> 01:50.340]  to Maddie and Spence. They had a little dinner at their house before the party. We went to
[01:50.340 --> 01:53.380]  a bowling alley and tried to bowl, but it was too damn crowded, so everyone just ended
[01:53.380 --> 01:57.620]  up in the bar. But before that, we went to Spence and Maddie's and had some food. And
[01:57.620 --> 02:01.220]  I'm a vegetarian, and I will not eat anything with animals or animal products in it. That's
[02:01.220 --> 02:05.220]  just my personal preference. You can eat what you want. I don't judge you, but I don't eat
[02:05.220 --> 02:11.340]  animals. They were nice enough to make me several. There was an entree for me. They
[02:11.340 --> 02:15.420]  made a portobello, a big portobello mushroom, and I put it on a bun and I called it a portobello
[02:15.420 --> 02:19.820]  mushroom burger. I put a couple slices of avocado, some Swiss cheese, put a little bit
[02:19.820 --> 02:23.620]  of onion on there. It was delicious. They made some potatoes that were delicious and
[02:23.620 --> 02:27.980]  some potato salad or some pasta salad that was amazing. So big, huge shout out to those
[02:27.980 --> 02:33.380]  guys for catering to my picky ass and taking care of me and my picky diet. That's really
[02:33.380 --> 02:36.580]  cool. So shout out to Spence and Maddie. I appreciate it, you guys. Thanks for having
[02:36.580 --> 02:41.900]  me at the party. Love it. Love you guys every day. So yesterday was Bob Marley's birthday
[02:41.900 --> 02:45.220]  since we're doing birthday shout outs. I got dreadlocks and I'm a Rasta, so you know I
[02:45.220 --> 02:49.740]  love me some Bob Marley. Big shout out to Bob Marley. There's a lot of other reggae,
[02:49.740 --> 02:52.820]  you guys. Everyone always tells me when they see my dreadlocks, their first thing a lot
[02:52.820 --> 02:56.220]  of people say is, I love Bob Marley. Dude, there's more reggae. Listen to some other
[02:56.220 --> 03:00.980]  reggae. Check out some Steel Pulse. Check out some Morgan Heritage. And if you're into
[03:00.980 --> 03:05.020]  it, it's a little bit different. Check out some Bounty Killer and some Capleton and see
[03:05.020 --> 03:10.460]  where I was inspired to name my strains from. I honored two of my favorite reggae artists.
[03:10.460 --> 03:14.380]  Actually three of them. The Kalonji is after Sizzla Kalonji. So check out Sizzla, Bounty
[03:14.380 --> 03:18.340]  Killer and Capleton also and see where I decided to name some of my strains that I've
[03:18.340 --> 03:22.220]  bred from. I'm doing an episode by myself, guys, so I'm just going to be rambling for
[03:22.220 --> 03:27.580]  a little while. I've got some news articles and this will be the episode where I am going
[03:27.580 --> 03:32.340]  to announce the winners from episode number 50. So I'm probably going to probably going
[03:32.340 --> 03:38.020]  to do that towards the end of the show just to keep you listening because that's how you
[03:38.020 --> 03:40.840]  build suspense and keep people listening. But this is the one. So if you entered the
[03:40.840 --> 03:45.880]  contest on Facebook and or Instagram, this could be the show where you're going to get
[03:45.880 --> 03:48.880]  excited and win some shit. So keep listening and I'll tell you the winners in a minute
[03:48.880 --> 03:52.240]  here before we get that far. I have to do this part. This podcast is brought to you
[03:52.240 --> 03:56.780]  by some of my good friends, some of my favorite people, Jesse and Bern over at Hygro Indoor

[04:46.180 --> 04:50.260]  before, the minute you pick up this bag of worm castings, you will know that this is
[04:50.260 --> 04:55.660]  a high quality bag of castings. Nobody paid me to say that. I bought a bag of it myself
[04:55.660 --> 05:00.780]  and it smells rich like worm casting should. It's the proper color. I made a little bit
[05:00.780 --> 05:06.460]  of tea out of it and that tea foamed up really nice. It smelled good. A lot of people are
[05:06.460 --> 05:09.660]  going to think I'm gross because I think the worm tea smells good, but it smelled the way
[05:09.660 --> 05:13.980]  it was supposed to. Quality, quality worm castings. I apologize for the mic bump right
[05:13.980 --> 05:18.540]  there. That was weird. All right. So check out Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. Also, big
[05:18.540 --> 05:23.740]  shout out to Jay and the Rocky Mountain Worm Company. They are scheduled, Jay and one of
[05:23.740 --> 05:26.820]  his partners whose first name I do not know. I know his Instagram name, but I don't know
[05:26.820 --> 05:30.340]  his real name. Jay from Rocky Mountain Worm Company and one of his partners are scheduled
[05:30.340 --> 05:35.380]  to be here on this podcast. They're supposed to be here Tuesday afternoon. I think we said
[05:35.380 --> 05:38.180]  six o'clock. It might've been five o'clock. I'll check my scheduling, but they will be
[05:38.180 --> 05:43.460]  here to record a podcast. So next episode should be Jay from Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[05:43.460 --> 05:49.780]  And we're going to talk about worms and environmentally sustainable cannabis and organics. And we'll
[05:49.780 --> 05:53.060]  see what Jay brings to the table. I'm going to kind of let them talk and tell us what
[05:53.060 --> 05:59.700]  they want to say. And coming up after that, I think will be an episode with Jesse talking
[05:59.780 --> 06:05.300]  about, we want to give a lesson on light deprivation so that you guys can get your outdoor crops
[06:05.300 --> 06:08.740]  going a little bit earlier this year. So we're going to start, we're starting to plan more
[06:08.740 --> 06:12.020]  outdoor lessons. I'm just letting you guys know we got a lot of cool shit coming up.
[06:12.020 --> 06:16.340]  I'm not slacking off like I used to. I'm trying to get more on top of the podcast. I used to do
[06:16.340 --> 06:20.180]  it week by week. Now I'm trying to be a week or two ahead of myself. It just feels better.
[06:20.180 --> 06:24.260]  And I feel like I'm bringing you a better show, which I want to keep doing. Thanks for listening.
[06:24.260 --> 06:27.220]  Thanks to somebody told me that they went back and listened to a bunch of old episodes and I
[06:27.220 --> 06:31.460]  felt embarrassed, but then they told me, don't be embarrassed because I'm kicking ass now. And
[06:31.460 --> 06:34.820]  they got to see the progression. So that's cool. Thanks a lot, dude. The guy that said that,

[07:57.700 --> 08:03.140]  So where was I? I want to take a minute and read a couple of the Facebook and Stitcher comments that
[08:03.140 --> 08:07.380]  I've gotten recently. I had to save them on my phone. So I'm searching through the phone right
[08:07.380 --> 08:13.940]  now to find that. Come on iPhone, man. My iPhone has been slow lately. All right, here we go.
[08:14.180 --> 08:20.900]  This is a comment that was left on our iTunes, the grow from your heart iTunes page. This comment
[08:20.900 --> 08:27.380]  was from a person who calls himself sticky wiki. He gave us five stars and he says, good. Listen,
[08:27.380 --> 08:31.780]  recently found the podcast. I have followed I read genetics on Ig, which is Instagram.
[08:31.780 --> 08:35.540]  I followed I read genetics on Instagram for a while now, and I'm really enjoying some of these
[08:35.540 --> 08:40.980]  episodes and take care. So right on dude, a sticky wiki gave us five stars and let's
[08:41.940 --> 08:46.420]  stick. He wiki gave us five stars and loves the show. Thanks for listening, bro. Thanks for also
[08:46.420 --> 08:49.620]  thanks for following. I read genetics on Instagram. I'm glad to have you on there.
[08:49.620 --> 08:54.020]  Go comment on something and I will follow you. Show me who you are and I'll follow you back.
[08:54.900 --> 09:00.660]  Our next comment was from a guy named buzzer with a bunch of Z's. He said, sweet show,
[09:00.660 --> 09:07.300]  five stars. And his comment was thanks for making this for us. Dude, you're very welcome. Thanks
[09:07.300 --> 09:11.780]  for listening. Thanks for commenting. Thanks for showing me that you appreciate it. That makes it
[09:11.780 --> 09:16.500]  all worth it. I hope you're growing better cannabis than you were before. And I hope you have a better
[09:16.500 --> 09:22.340]  understanding of the cannabis plant, the community and my goal of the plant. I hope you learned some
[09:22.340 --> 09:26.180]  stuff and thanks a lot, man. And then Robert Lee commented, Robert Lee, I know who you are,
[09:26.180 --> 09:28.980]  dude. Thanks for finally listening to the show. I've been trying to get you to listen to the
[09:28.980 --> 09:33.460]  podcast for a little while. You seem to be reluctant to hear me on the show, but thanks
[09:33.460 --> 09:37.940]  for listening. His comment was left on Stitcher and he said, I really enjoyed this episode. Very
[09:37.940 --> 09:44.100]  informative. And he left that comment on episode 51, our CBD episode, which featured Angela and my
[09:44.100 --> 09:49.700]  good buddy Clint. If you guys listen to that, you understand why I'm going to give a huge shout out
[09:49.700 --> 09:53.780]  to Angela for letting me post that entire show without editing anything. That was really cool
[09:53.780 --> 09:57.220]  of her. Some of what she said there was kind of personal and could have been embarrassing,
[09:57.220 --> 10:01.300]  but she's a bad-ass chick. She's a bad-ass woman. She deserves more respect than being called a
[10:01.300 --> 10:05.700]  chick. She's a bad-ass woman. And she let me post the entire conversation without a single edit.
[10:05.700 --> 10:10.020]  So that's really cool. Thank you. I hope you're listening to this episode. All right. So that was
[10:10.020 --> 10:15.940]  the Stitcher and iTunes comments. Sorry, I had a little bit of a brain fart there. I really
[10:15.940 --> 10:21.300]  appreciate you guys leaving comments. It shows me that you are listening to the show. And if you
[10:21.300 --> 10:26.100]  hate the show, you can leave a comment because I haven't gotten a shitty comment yet. And do people
[10:26.100 --> 10:30.260]  just not do that? Do you just not, you probably skipped it and don't even want to listen if you
[10:30.260 --> 10:33.540]  hated it, right? You don't even go leave a shitty review, but it makes me feel good that people are
[10:33.540 --> 10:37.140]  liking it and giving me lots of good stars. Please leave me a review, you guys, because what that
[10:37.140 --> 10:41.860]  does is it boosts me up in the iTunes and in the Stitcher rankings. And then more people see the
[10:41.860 --> 10:45.860]  show. And then the more people see the show, the more listen. And then the more people grow,
[10:45.860 --> 10:49.940]  better cannabis. And the more people have a better education about cannabis, and then we can
[10:49.940 --> 10:54.420]  dispel a lot of the stupid myths and rumors, and then we can legalize cannabis worldwide.
[10:54.740 --> 11:00.260]  That's our, I think that's our goal for now is to legalize it and grow the best we can. Those
[11:00.260 --> 11:04.260]  are our two main objectives. If we're going to assign ourselves main goals, that's it. Grow the
[11:04.260 --> 11:09.140]  best cannabis we can and legalize the shit everywhere. All right. I'm really rambly today,
[11:09.140 --> 11:13.860]  which is good because I'm by myself. I think it's time to get into some news articles.
[11:14.820 --> 11:20.580]  Our first article has nothing to do with cannabis. Well, it loosely has something to do with cannabis.
[11:21.540 --> 11:25.860]  It's something that is personal to me, and I found it very entertaining. The remaining members of
[11:25.860 --> 11:30.660]  The Grateful Dead, along with Trey from Phish, I know some of you guys are going blah, blah,
[11:30.660 --> 11:36.100]  blah right now, but just give me 10 seconds. There's a concert in Chicago on the third,
[11:36.100 --> 11:40.500]  fourth, and fifth of July at Soldier Field in Chicago. It is celebrating 50 years of The
[11:40.500 --> 11:44.500]  Grateful Dead. It's Mickey Hart, Bill Kruitzman, Phil Lesch, Bob Ware, Trey Anastasio, Jeff
[11:44.500 --> 11:50.020]  Cimenti, and Bruce Hornsby. Sorry, that was hard to read. They're doing three shows. It's all
[11:50.020 --> 11:56.180]  Grateful Dead music. This article comes from Jambase.com. It says, if you're like us, you
[11:56.180 --> 12:01.220]  were wondering just how many mail orders were received for Fare Thee Well, which will bring
[12:01.220 --> 12:05.460]  together Grateful Dead members Bob Ware, Phil Lesch, Mickey Hart, and Bill Kruitzman, along
[12:05.460 --> 12:09.940]  with Trey Anastasio, Jeff Cimenti, and Bruce Hornsby for three nights of shows in Chicago
[12:09.940 --> 12:14.660]  over the fourth of July weekend. The answer is almost unbelievable. This is the part I wanted
[12:14.660 --> 12:20.820]  to talk about. As a note, on the event's website mentions that 60,000 plus envelopes were received
[12:20.820 --> 12:26.500]  so far, which is by the company that's handling their mail order fulfillment. The tickets only
[12:26.500 --> 12:31.540]  went on sale through mail order, which is only the people that know what's up are going to be
[12:31.540 --> 12:35.860]  able to order the mail order. This isn't a publicly known thing. You got to be on the inside.
[12:36.980 --> 12:43.300]  They got 60,000 requests just from the mail order. That is amazing. That's crazy. This is going to
[12:43.300 --> 12:49.780]  be a huge event, you guys. If you're in Chicago on the third, fourth, or fifth of July, make sure
[12:49.780 --> 12:54.340]  you go check out Soldier Field. Even if you don't want to go to the concert, go see what it's like
[12:54.340 --> 12:59.300]  to be on a Grateful Dead lot, the parking lot scene. Just go see that hippie scene. Go see that
[12:59.300 --> 13:06.740]  community. I didn't get to see the Grateful Dead because I was only 15 when Jerry died, I think,
[13:06.820 --> 13:13.860]  15 or 16. I did see plenty of fish. At the time, fish took over for the Grateful Dead.
[13:15.060 --> 13:19.620]  The dead fish, all of that stuff means something to me. If you guys go see that lot, go see that
[13:19.620 --> 13:22.900]  show. You never know, Rasta Jeff could be there. I have not committed to anything yet.
[13:23.620 --> 13:28.100]  Go see that show. Go check that shit out, dude. Go see what it's like. That's a lot of why I am
[13:28.100 --> 13:34.020]  who I am and a lot of what made me who I am. Honestly, the strained chem dog was discovered
[13:34.020 --> 13:38.980]  in a bag of weed that was bought on a Grateful Dead parking lot at a Grateful Dead show. That's
[13:38.980 --> 13:42.820]  where chem dog came from. If there weren't these silly hippies traveling around being deadheads,
[13:42.820 --> 13:46.580]  chem dog would not exist. A lot of the strains that we work with now would not exist.
[13:47.140 --> 13:51.140]  Most of my lineup would not exist because a lot of my stuff is crossed with chem dog.
[13:52.100 --> 13:59.140]  Anyway, news article here, number two. It says, new regulations on pot edibles designed to protect
[13:59.140 --> 14:05.380]  children and adults. This was put out January 30th. This is actually from CBS Denver Channel 4.
[14:06.980 --> 14:11.540]  It says, new regulations on pot edibles go into effect Sunday. Those regulations are designed to
[14:11.540 --> 14:16.260]  protect children and warn adults about the potency of marijuana edibles. The law is being put into
[14:16.260 --> 14:20.420]  place by the Colorado Department of Revenue. The agency is hoping to prevent problems that have
[14:20.420 --> 14:25.700]  put Colorado's budding retail pot industry under scrutiny. Then there's a picture of this African
[14:25.700 --> 14:31.860]  student. They're trying to blame a lot of this on him. I'll keep reading. Last year, African student
[14:31.860 --> 14:37.460]  and African student in Wyoming, Levi, I'm just going to say Levi Tamba because I'm not sure how
[14:37.460 --> 14:42.820]  to pronounce that. Levi Tamba died after eating an entire marijuana infused cookie and jumping
[14:42.820 --> 14:48.260]  off a hotel balcony. There have also been several cases of children mistaking pot for candy.
[14:49.060 --> 14:53.380]  That means some changes for edibles, including placing marijuana infused candy and baked goods
[14:53.380 --> 14:58.180]  in childproof packaging. Each individual square of chocolate must be marked according to how
[14:58.180 --> 15:03.700]  potent it is. You guys, back in the day when you would buy, I can't even pick a brand because I
[15:03.700 --> 15:07.620]  don't want to single out a brand. Back in the day when you would buy a large edible of a candy bar,
[15:07.620 --> 15:11.860]  it would be the size of your normal candy bar that you buy at the gas station or wherever you're at
[15:11.860 --> 15:16.020]  the grocery store, wherever you get your candy bar. You would buy that one candy bar and it would
[15:16.020 --> 15:20.020]  just look, it would be in a wrapper that was plainly marked, this is a ganja candy bar.
[15:20.020 --> 15:25.220]  Then once you open it, you can't tell at all. Now every single piece, they have made a mold that
[15:25.220 --> 15:28.820]  you pour your chocolate into, not you, but the companies, they pour their chocolate into there
[15:29.460 --> 15:33.460]  and it divides it for you into little squares. They're showing a picture of it,
[15:33.460 --> 15:38.980]  the whole candy bar is 100 milligrams, but now they've divided it into 10 little squares and
[15:38.980 --> 15:44.820]  they're all labeled 10 milligrams THC for each little square. Now it's a little better because
[15:44.820 --> 15:49.780]  sometimes when you buy edibles, you don't remember what you bought or you don't remember
[15:49.780 --> 15:55.220]  which is which or sometimes it's hard to tell if this is a third or if this is a quarter.
[15:55.220 --> 15:58.180]  Now these guys have really made it nice and easy for you. I'll keep reading the article.
[15:58.740 --> 16:03.540]  It says, at the Incredibles Edibles shop, they mark each square of chocolate with the number
[16:03.540 --> 16:08.100]  10 to indicate 10 milligrams of THC, the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana.
[16:08.100 --> 16:14.500]  10 is the standard serving. In the past, chocolate didn't have to indicate the amount of THC in each
[16:14.500 --> 16:18.740]  bar. Some of them were in line with what the industry feels will improve. I'm going to start
[16:18.740 --> 16:22.500]  that sentence again. I'm sorry. Some of them are in line with what the industry feels will improve
[16:22.500 --> 16:27.220]  safety out there. Others seem like overkill, but we were happy to do it, said Incredibles spokesman,
[16:27.220 --> 16:32.100]  Bob Aschino. Some clerks working at retail pot shops had been recommending much more,
[16:32.100 --> 16:36.420]  which could cause some issues with those who had not had much experience with edibles.
[16:36.420 --> 16:41.620]  Now edible packaging contains warnings to eat only a small amount and then wait before eating more.
[16:41.700 --> 16:47.540]  It says, wait 45 minutes. When you eat this, wait 45... This is a weirdly worded article.
[16:48.100 --> 16:53.300]  It says, wait 45 minutes. When you eat this, wait 45 minutes to see how it affects you. Then you can
[16:53.300 --> 16:59.700]  continue with another dose if you really wanted to, says Sweet Leaf spokeswoman, Elizabeth D.
[16:59.700 --> 17:04.340]  That's a long last name. Elizabeth D. I won't butcher that for you. They're showing a picture
[17:04.340 --> 17:09.220]  of the package and it totally shows a little... It says, to educate and to medicate. There's a
[17:09.220 --> 17:12.740]  little clock on there, like the one that you'd see at the store that says be back in 10 minutes.
[17:12.740 --> 17:18.580]  Instead, it shows, it says, take one square, wait two hours. They're trying to encourage you to take
[17:18.580 --> 17:22.020]  one and wait two hours. The problem is a lot of people don't, dude. They think they're badasses
[17:22.020 --> 17:26.420]  and they can just eat it all. Back into the article, a variety of the marijuana infused
[17:26.420 --> 17:31.620]  products, including drinks, cookies, and candies come in single servings. We just want to educate
[17:31.620 --> 17:36.740]  people that five milligrams is a good serving. Not too much, not over the top, make it safe,
[17:36.740 --> 17:41.540]  said Elizabeth. I can't read her last name. I'm sorry. It's long. This is the first step
[17:41.540 --> 17:46.740]  in regulation for the edibles industry. This is a good idea, you guys, but something I wanted to
[17:46.740 --> 17:53.300]  bring up, this is going to crush a couple of companies, I'm sure, because this came up quickly
[17:53.300 --> 17:57.620]  and it had to happen. I think it went into effect on the first of this month and they didn't get a
[17:57.620 --> 18:03.380]  lot of time. People had to pull product that they have already made, already have packaged. They had
[18:03.380 --> 18:07.620]  to pull it all off the shelf. Then they had to repackage it, or I don't know if they were even
[18:07.620 --> 18:11.060]  allowed to repackage it because if the pieces weren't properly labeled, they had to destroy
[18:11.060 --> 18:16.580]  those candy bars. I'm certain that this put at least one or two small businesses out of business
[18:16.580 --> 18:22.580]  because of these new regulations they keep pushing on us. I agree with the whole situation because,
[18:24.900 --> 18:29.940]  well, I work at the dispensary and I hang out with people that work there all day. We insist
[18:29.940 --> 18:36.020]  to people, just take this. They laugh like they're Superman. They don't realize what they're
[18:36.020 --> 18:41.540]  buying is proper. They're used to buying brownies that their cousin made or that their stoner uncle
[18:41.540 --> 18:45.060]  made and they weren't that potent. They're buying these medical edibles and they're just getting,
[18:45.060 --> 18:48.020]  or they're rec edibles, but they're made by the same people that make medical.
[18:48.580 --> 18:52.980]  They're buying these quality edibles and they're just getting fucked up. I like the idea that we're
[18:52.980 --> 19:00.260]  marking them each piece, but I'm sure it's hard for a business to keep itself going when every
[19:00.260 --> 19:04.020]  month there's a new regulation. They're like, oh, you guys put all those stripes on the package. Now
[19:04.020 --> 19:08.980]  you have to put the stripes plus a hologram. That's going to crush somebody. All right,
[19:08.980 --> 19:14.420]  let's get into another news article because that one is boring as shit. This one is from
[19:14.420 --> 19:18.660]  The Cannabis. What's up to The Cannabis? I read a lot of their stuff. This article is by David
[19:18.660 --> 19:24.260]  Magoya. He's a writer for the Denver Post. The headline says, Oregon's M-Bank pulls out of
[19:24.260 --> 19:29.220]  Colorado a week after taking on pot accounts. A lot of you are going to say what, but I'll
[19:29.220 --> 19:33.780]  catch you up to speed. It says, the Oregon Community Bank that a week ago openly welcomed
[19:33.780 --> 19:38.180]  Colorado marijuana industry customers has changed its mind, publicly saying it doesn't have the
[19:38.180 --> 19:43.620]  infrastructure to handle the overwhelming response for service. But people familiar with the move say
[19:43.620 --> 19:47.460]  the retreat was pressed by federal banking regulators who stepped in late last week to
[19:47.460 --> 19:52.820]  tell M-Bank executives that crossing several states to work with an industry that remains
[19:52.820 --> 19:58.340]  illegal under federal law was simply too risky. Following national press, the volume of inquiries
[19:58.340 --> 20:02.740]  in Oregon, Washington, and Colorado has been so overwhelming that we don't currently have the
[20:03.300 --> 20:08.660]  infrastructure to adequately support all of these customers, M-Bank CEO Jeff Baker said Monday.
[20:09.380 --> 20:13.700]  Colorado is the furthest from our market area and the most difficult to provide the quality customer
[20:13.700 --> 20:20.020]  service to. There are nearly 2,200 pot retail manufacturing and grow businesses in Colorado,
[20:20.020 --> 20:24.580]  according to the state licensing data. The bank will continue to serve legal marijuana businesses
[20:24.580 --> 20:30.420]  in Oregon and Washington, Baker said. Industry insiders said the pullback was not unexpected.
[20:30.420 --> 20:34.820]  We've become accustomed to our banking solutions not actually working out, said Michael Elliott,
[20:34.820 --> 20:40.580]  executive director of the marijuana industry group. After they got all that press, I was
[20:40.580 --> 20:45.300]  wondering if they'd get increased scrutiny and pressure as a result, just like all the other
[20:45.300 --> 20:52.500]  banks have. Part of the issue, Baker said, was M-Bank's lack of a Colorado branch, which would
[20:52.500 --> 20:57.140]  require approval from the state banking authorities. It did not need approval to accept deposits from
[20:57.140 --> 21:01.860]  Colorado businesses. So they're just searching for loopholes to not want to do business with us.
[21:01.860 --> 21:06.740]  All right, it says, without branch cash deposits, millions of dollars that often must be treated
[21:06.740 --> 21:11.780]  with cleaners, such as Febreze, to remove the pungent marijuana smell would have to be made
[21:11.780 --> 21:17.220]  at a federal reserve bank, such as one located in downtown Denver. From there, deposits would
[21:17.220 --> 21:22.100]  be electronically credited to M-Bank's accounts, then to its marijuana business depositors.
[21:22.660 --> 21:29.300]  Founded in 1995, the $165 million bank has three Oregon locations in and around Portland.
[21:29.300 --> 21:33.700]  It nearly closed in 2009, following a string of problems that ranged from inadequate board
[21:34.020 --> 21:45.940]  management to a balance sheet weighed down by toxic and poorly performing loans. That was hard
[21:45.940 --> 21:50.340]  to say, dude. I'm going to take a dab here after this article, trust me. All right, Baker said the
[21:50.340 --> 21:55.620]  five Colorado-based marijuana business accounts that were open will most likely be closed. I'm
[21:55.620 --> 22:02.180]  not 100% on that, but we're reviewing it. Another 60 inquiries from Colorado pot shop owners will be
[22:02.180 --> 22:07.460]  shelved, he said. When M-Bank went public with its desire to bank the marijuana sector last week,
[22:07.460 --> 22:12.660]  its brazenness raised industry eyebrows. Banking regulators, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance
[22:12.660 --> 22:18.260]  Corporation, which oversees M-Bank, have frowned on institutions that are overt about working with
[22:18.260 --> 22:23.620]  legal cannabis businesses. Colorado's legal pot businesses have long lamented that their accounts
[22:23.620 --> 22:31.460]  are closed as soon as where they are banking becomes public. That was odd. This is exactly
[22:31.460 --> 22:36.020]  the reason why the marijuana industry cannot say who they have a bank account with and why the banks
[22:36.020 --> 22:41.700]  don't want it public, Elliott said. Baker sidestepped the question about whether the FDIC, the agency
[22:41.700 --> 22:46.580]  he said offered its tactic approval to the idea only a week ago that pushed M-Bank out of control,
[22:46.580 --> 22:51.860]  out of Colorado. We are regulated by the government and the expectation is that we run our bank in a
[22:51.860 --> 22:56.740]  safe and sound manner. In the event we don't, we face severe repercussions from our regulators,
[22:56.740 --> 23:01.620]  Baker said. Certainly regulators influence our decisions, but it ultimately is our call.
[23:01.620 --> 23:05.220]  So they were definitely coerced into it by the FDIC. They don't want,
[23:05.220 --> 23:08.660]  the feds don't want cannabis money. They don't want us to be able to bank, I think.
[23:11.140 --> 23:15.220]  All right, I'll continue with the article. Sorry, I needed a drink. Others familiar with the outcome
[23:15.220 --> 23:19.380]  of the FDIC frowned at the public nature of M-Bank's move, making it unclear whether the
[23:19.380 --> 23:25.380]  plan would have met approval had it not been so well publicized. The regulators have the gun and
[23:25.380 --> 23:30.180]  all the bullets said one banking insider who's familiar with the FDIC and its methods. Any of us
[23:30.180 --> 23:34.740]  who have survived the financial crisis knows exactly how this works. If we're not team players,
[23:34.740 --> 23:39.940]  our life becomes miserable. Colorado has had several efforts at banking, at banking the
[23:39.940 --> 23:45.060]  marijuana industry go awry. The most recent, a long delay in the opening of the fourth corner
[23:45.060 --> 23:49.380]  credit union. The world's first credit union created specifically for the pot industry had
[23:49.380 --> 23:54.020]  expected to open at the new year, but it has not yet been granted a master account by the Federal
[23:54.020 --> 24:00.020]  Reserve Bank in Kansas City. So they're already two months, almost three months behind in getting
[24:00.020 --> 24:04.740]  that open because the feds don't want us to put our money in the banks so that we can have it on
[24:04.740 --> 24:08.900]  us when they rate us. That's why they can take it all from us. All right, I'll keep reading. A move
[24:08.900 --> 24:15.540]  last year by the Colorado legislature set the stage for banking for a banking cooperative similar to a
[24:15.540 --> 24:20.660]  credit union, but has made no progress despite numerous discussions. That's because it too would
[24:20.660 --> 24:25.860]  require the same master account necessary to access the nation's money system. Colorado Springs
[24:25.860 --> 24:30.900]  State Bank, the last Colorado bank to openly work with the marijuana industry, closed about 300
[24:30.900 --> 24:36.900]  accounts in late 2011 amid concerns of working with companies that violate federal law. Baker
[24:36.900 --> 24:42.100]  said he'll likely revisit the Colorado plan, but it might take some time. The position of state and
[24:42.100 --> 24:46.820]  federal regulators is that they do not object to banking services being provided to the cannabis
[24:46.820 --> 24:51.540]  industry, he said. However, they absolutely expect the development of strong programs.
[24:51.540 --> 24:57.380]  Time and experience will allow programs to become stronger. It doesn't sound like they want to work
[24:57.380 --> 25:01.940]  with us at all, to tell you the truth. These dispensaries are making a lot of money and
[25:01.940 --> 25:08.820]  without having a bank, I see how difficult it can be because other businesses don't want to be paid
[25:08.820 --> 25:15.140]  in cash. Whatever businesses are attached to your dispensary, I don't want to... You have to have a
[25:15.140 --> 25:19.380]  security guard all day long, so you have to pay for security service. The security service does not
[25:19.380 --> 25:24.420]  want to be paid in cash. All of the dispensary customers paid in cash, so now the dispensary
[25:24.420 --> 25:29.940]  is sitting on a shit ton of cash. They have to turn that into some sort of currency that they can pay
[25:29.940 --> 25:34.180]  the electricity, they got to pay payroll, they've got to pay the accountant, they got to pay the
[25:34.180 --> 25:38.500]  lawyer, they've got to pay the employees, they got to pay the master grower, they got to buy nutrients.
[25:39.140 --> 25:43.140]  It's a pain in the ass to deal with this because I'm going to press pause for a second.
[25:43.140 --> 25:45.620]  I'm going to take a drink and a dab and I'll be right back with you. Hold on.
[25:46.260 --> 25:48.740]  All right, guys, thanks for letting me get a quick drink. I needed that. I was getting all
[25:48.740 --> 25:51.780]  dried out. I got a couple more news articles and then we're going to get to the part that
[25:51.780 --> 25:57.620]  everyone's waiting for. I'm going to give away some prizes. Some prizes. Just bear with me through a
[25:57.620 --> 26:01.540]  couple more articles. I'm building up suspense, that's all. I've got another article in a minute
[26:01.540 --> 26:05.300]  that's going to come from my hometown, so that's a little bit interesting. I'm going to click over
[26:05.300 --> 26:10.100]  and see how long we've been going at this. 25 minutes. Yeah. A couple more articles and I'll
[26:10.100 --> 26:12.740]  give away the prizes and I'll get out of here and let you guys get back onto your day.
[26:15.380 --> 26:21.300]  Let's see. This article is from Ricardo Baca from The Cannabis. Once again, it says $573 million
[26:21.300 --> 26:28.660]  in pot sales. Here are 12 stats that define the year in marijuana. A couple episodes ago,
[26:28.660 --> 26:33.140]  Spence and Maddie came on and we talked about the year in review. Then in episode 50, we talked
[26:33.140 --> 26:38.740]  about Live Resin being one of the big dicks of the year. The Cannabis went and put together their 12
[26:38.740 --> 26:42.900]  stats of the year. I'll read most of these. I probably won't read all 12 of them because I want
[26:42.900 --> 26:49.140]  to get to the prizes, you guys. The first one says, number one, 130.3 metric tons. That's
[26:49.140 --> 26:55.860]  Colorado's annual demand for marijuana equal to 36.8 million eighths of cannabis flower.
[26:57.220 --> 27:04.500]  Every year, Colorado sells and or smokes 36.8 million eighths. That's a lot of eighths.
[27:04.980 --> 27:11.620]  If you're buying them at a shop, that's averaging you about $65 to $70 an eighth. That's a lot of
[27:11.620 --> 27:18.260]  freaking money we're bringing in. It says, makes you wonder how many Coloradans use regularly.
[27:18.820 --> 27:25.540]  The answer to that is 485,000. That's the number of adults who are 21 and older using marijuana
[27:25.540 --> 27:31.300]  regularly, which they account for at least once a month. It's about 9% of the state's population.
[27:32.260 --> 27:38.020]  Then it says, and what about those using more often than that? 23%. That's the amount of
[27:38.020 --> 27:43.380]  Colorado's user population that consumes cannabis nearly daily. If you're in my club,
[27:43.380 --> 27:47.540]  23% of us, we're in the 23 club, we smoke cannabis on a daily basis.
[27:48.580 --> 27:53.540]  What about the out-of-state tourists visiting Colorado that purchase legal weed? 90%.
[27:54.980 --> 28:00.100]  That's the amount of recreational pot sales out-of-state tourists are responsible for at
[28:00.100 --> 28:05.060]  shops in mountain town resort communities. They're saying places like Breck and Vail,
[28:05.780 --> 28:12.020]  90% of pot sales are from out-of-state tourists. In my neighborhood, in our area, what we have
[28:12.020 --> 28:18.020]  observed, I'm going to say about 70% of the people that stop into the spot dispensary are from out
[28:18.020 --> 28:24.260]  of state. I'm going to say 50% of the people are from Texas. That's just what we have observed
[28:25.140 --> 28:31.220]  being in the place a lot. The next one says, but how much of Colorado's annual demand are
[28:31.220 --> 28:36.340]  these tourists actually buying? 7%. That's the amount of Colorado's annual pot demand purchased
[28:36.340 --> 28:43.380]  by out-of-state tourists. 9% is the price drop on a recreational eighth of marijuana
[28:44.100 --> 28:52.900]  at a dozen prominent Colorado shops since the 1st of January. An eighth has gone from $55 or $53.88
[28:53.620 --> 29:00.420]  to $48.95 is how much the prices have dropped. I'm going to skip over a couple of these because
[29:00.420 --> 29:13.300]  they're just ridiculous numbers. Jesus, is that 200 and has that a million? Okay, 246,810,599.03
[29:14.100 --> 29:19.780]  is the state's total recreational marijuana sales as counted from January to October.
[29:20.740 --> 29:25.140]  Because November and December data was not available at the time of this article from
[29:25.140 --> 29:32.580]  the Colorado Department of Revenue. $246 million, you guys. That's nine digits. You got your
[29:32.580 --> 29:36.500]  hundreds, you got your thousands, your hundred thousand, your 10,000, your hundred thousand,
[29:36.500 --> 29:41.380]  then you got these other three digits over here. There's two commas in that sets of money.
[29:41.380 --> 29:46.180]  That's a lot of damn money. Of course, you're going to ask, what about total medical sales?
[29:46.820 --> 29:59.780]  $326,716,273.59. Can you guys fathom that much money? That's nine digits. That's a lot of money,
[29:59.780 --> 30:07.780]  dude. That's Colorado's total medical marijuana sales also from January to October. Somebody do
[30:07.780 --> 30:22.180]  some math on that. That's $572 million, dude. $572 million we made on legal cannabis sales.
[30:24.020 --> 30:28.980]  Gosh, that's a lot of money. Imagine where that was going before we had legalized cannabis.
[30:28.980 --> 30:32.660]  Of course, a lot of it is coming from out of state people and stuff, but imagine where that money was
[30:32.660 --> 30:37.300]  going before we had legalized cannabis. Where was that going? What was happening with it?
[30:38.660 --> 30:45.220]  The next number is 103,918. That's the number of medical marijuana patients reporting severe
[30:45.220 --> 30:52.420]  pain as their condition for a license, or 94% of the state's total patients are using severe pain
[30:52.420 --> 30:57.540]  as their condition. How can you deny severe pain? If you go to the doctor and you say,
[30:57.540 --> 31:01.620]  it hurts, he's going to go, I believe you because he's a doctor and he's compassionate.
[31:01.620 --> 31:09.460]  Hell yeah, use that one. It hurts. Pick a spot and say it hurts. $60.1 million, that's the amount
[31:10.740 --> 31:15.780]  Colorado has brought in via taxes, licenses, and fees on recreational and medical marijuana,
[31:16.580 --> 31:21.220]  I'm not going to say marijuana, recreational and medical cannabis from January to October.
[31:22.260 --> 31:29.300]  $60.1 million has been brought into the state of Colorado just from taxes, licenses, and fees.
[31:29.300 --> 31:36.660]  Nothing was sold and no product passed hands that way, simply licensing and taxing people. $60.1
[31:36.660 --> 31:42.740]  million. Oh my goodness. All right. What about the cannabis infused edibles, the cookies and
[31:42.740 --> 31:47.300]  gummies and brownies that proved to be surprisingly popular in this first year of recreational sales?
[31:47.860 --> 31:52.980]  And then the answer is 10 milligrams of THC. That's the state's standard single serving size
[31:52.980 --> 31:57.940]  for marijuana edibles with a hundred milligrams maximum allowed in an individually packaged
[31:57.940 --> 32:05.780]  product being sold recreationally. A hundred milligram incredible bar is fine. There's
[32:05.780 --> 32:08.900]  nothing, you don't need more than that. If you're from out of state and you're coming here and
[32:08.900 --> 32:12.900]  you're going to buy a hundred milligram edible, you're good. Don't eat that whole thing. I see
[32:12.900 --> 32:18.580]  that that is a decent amount. A hundred milligrams is a good limit. And you can buy multiple of those
[32:18.580 --> 32:22.260]  because you're allowed up to, if you're out of state, you're allowed up to seven grams of cannabis.
[32:22.260 --> 32:26.420]  You're allowed to divide that into milligrams. However many milligrams are in that candy bar,
[32:26.420 --> 32:32.340]  you can get that many. So here's a neat fact. It says, and did any of these edibles end up
[32:32.340 --> 32:36.820]  making for a crazy Halloween as some thought they would? And then the response is zero.
[32:36.820 --> 32:41.300]  That's the number of reports of THC laced candy given to trick or treaters on Halloween,
[32:41.300 --> 32:45.460]  regardless of widespread concern that legal marijuana would lead to pot laced candies in
[32:45.460 --> 32:52.500]  children's Halloween hauls. Yeah. Nobody got ganja edibles because they're expensive. And
[32:52.580 --> 32:56.820]  because if you bought it, you probably ate it yourself and didn't want to give it to some kid.
[32:56.820 --> 33:02.900]  So those are 12 interesting facts, uh, statistics, I guess they are from the state of Colorado for
[33:02.900 --> 33:09.380]  the first year of legal cannabis. And I've got one more article. This comes from a part of this
[33:09.380 --> 33:17.380]  happened in my hometown in the lovely, lovely town of Pueblo, Colorado. Um, this is why I have said,
[33:17.380 --> 33:22.820]  stop shipping cannabis because this dude got caught and he is going to get
[33:22.820 --> 33:26.820]  fucked and then he'll probably get fucked after that, but I'm not going to go there.
[33:26.820 --> 33:34.100]  Um, the articles from the cannabis and it says police found $63,000 in marijuana and pot products
[33:34.100 --> 33:40.100]  in a UPS package. And then the headline is Pueblo police, Texas man arrested after trying to ship
[33:40.100 --> 33:47.780]  63 K of marijuana. There's a picture of a table with, uh, it looks like this dude has a bunch of
[33:47.780 --> 33:51.620]  eights and they're rolled up. I know those are probably ounces. Those are ounces. It looks like
[33:51.620 --> 33:55.220]  I'm trying to zoom in here. He's got ounces and they're wrapped up. And then those ounces are all
[33:55.220 --> 33:59.060]  shoved into bags. And it looks like he's got one, two, three, four of those ounces per bag.
[33:59.780 --> 34:03.860]  And then he's got one, two, three, four, five. They're like eight of them on the table. And
[34:03.860 --> 34:08.020]  whatever I just pushed made the thing refresh, but yeah, he's got several pounds there. And
[34:08.020 --> 34:12.580]  then there's another picture of a bunch of edibles. Uh, there's a monkey bar on there,
[34:12.580 --> 34:17.140]  which was one of my favorite edibles. There's a bunch of, uh, a bunch of really popular edibles.
[34:17.140 --> 34:22.020]  There's some, a hot mud concentrates. So it looks like this dude was trying to send the goods back
[34:22.020 --> 34:27.140]  to Texas and let's read about what happened to him. This article is by Jesse Paul from the Denver
[34:27.140 --> 34:31.620]  post. I found it on the cannabis. It says the Texas man was arrested Wednesday on suspicion
[34:31.620 --> 34:37.300]  of trying to send himself an estimated $63,000 in marijuana and marijuana products. Some of
[34:37.300 --> 34:43.620]  which was legally purchased, uh, from Pueblo back home. Um, and I'm curious because they say
[34:43.620 --> 34:49.300]  $63,000 is that Texas price or was that the price at the dispensary when he bought it?
[34:49.300 --> 34:54.900]  Or is that street price or is that DEA markup price? I'm curious. Um, should I say this guy's
[34:54.900 --> 34:57.380]  name? I don't want to say his name. I'll read his name in the article. I don't want to,
[34:57.380 --> 35:01.060]  because that makes him popular. He's going to get credit. Johnny Wolf was arrested by the San
[35:01.060 --> 35:07.140]  Angelo police department in Texas at his residence and is being held at the Tom green County jail
[35:07.220 --> 35:11.220]  in lieu of a hundred thousand dollars cash only bond. Pueblo police said,
[35:11.780 --> 35:15.060]  well, if has been charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.
[35:16.340 --> 35:21.060]  Here's where the article gets interesting to me. Uh, police in Pueblo began investigating,
[35:21.060 --> 35:25.780]  investigating Wolf early last month after United parcel service employees reported receiving a
[35:25.780 --> 35:31.220]  package that was suspicious. The package was sent by Wolf out of Pueblo to himself at an address in
[35:31.220 --> 35:37.860]  San Angelo, Texas. Uh, I want to know what makes it a package suspicious because, uh, they show a
[35:37.860 --> 35:43.620]  picture of this guy and this dude's got long hair and he looks like he'd be a rowdy Texas troublemaker.
[35:43.620 --> 35:46.740]  Sorry, dude, I just called you out, but you do, man. You got that long hair. I got dreadlocks
[35:46.740 --> 35:51.620]  tuber. I know what it's like, but you look like fucking trouble. I wonder if that was all it took
[35:51.620 --> 35:58.100]  to make them suspicious that, and the fact that he sent the package to himself in Texas. Uh, he's
[35:58.100 --> 36:02.820]  like, I'm Justin Wolf and I want to send this to Justin Wolf. That might've been it, but I'll keep
[36:02.820 --> 36:07.380]  reading. It says inside police found several double vacuum sealed packages with the total of
[36:07.380 --> 36:12.500]  nine pounds of high grade marijuana. Police said investigators say the package also had cannabis,
[36:12.500 --> 36:16.900]  edibles, cough syrup, skin patches, and wax concentrate that had been legally purchased
[36:16.900 --> 36:23.940]  from two separate dispensaries in Pueblo, Colorado. Police estimate the marijuana to be worth $58,000
[36:23.940 --> 36:29.060]  and the cannabis products worth to be $5,000. Pueblo police say they drafted a warrant on
[36:29.060 --> 36:34.020]  Tuesday for Wolf's arrest and contacted police in Texas who arrested him. I actually read this
[36:34.020 --> 36:41.140]  article somewhere else. Um, they said that they already have a team in Texas that works on this.
[36:41.140 --> 36:44.420]  So they're the way they just called their bros, you know, Hey, we got another one guys. And they
[36:44.420 --> 36:49.700]  would just went and picked him up. So my point, the reason I'm reading this article, stop fucking
[36:49.700 --> 36:53.780]  shipping things out of state. You guys are fucking it up for Colorado. We've got a good thing here.
[36:53.780 --> 36:57.460]  If you want some weed, come get it and enjoy it while you're here. If you want weed while you're
[36:57.460 --> 37:04.020]  at home in Texas or North Carolina or Alabama or fucking Arkansas, do what you got to do to make
[37:04.020 --> 37:08.580]  cannabis legal there. Don't come here and mail yourself some shit to your state and fuck it up
[37:08.580 --> 37:12.500]  for us. And you're fucking it up for yourself because you're going to go to jail and you're
[37:12.500 --> 37:16.260]  thwarting your legalization efforts in your own place. You could have spent that energy, that time
[37:16.260 --> 37:21.780]  and that money legalizing cannabis where you are. That's my rant on that. Don't don't send shit in
[37:21.780 --> 37:27.140]  the mail, dude. It's dumb. This guy is going to go to prison and he's got long hair and he's a skinny
[37:27.140 --> 37:32.980]  white dude. I, he will not do well in prison. We're the same build. I don't want to go to prison. It's
[37:32.980 --> 37:38.020]  not going to be fun. Don't ship some shit. You guys. All right. I'll quit bitching at you about
[37:38.020 --> 37:40.500]  shipping shit. Cause most of the people that listen to the show, aren't the people that are
[37:40.500 --> 37:45.460]  going to ship some stuff anyway. So I'll quit bitching at you. I guess it is time to get to
[37:45.460 --> 37:49.220]  the fun part. Let's see how long the show has been going. We're 37 minutes in and I haven't given out
[37:49.220 --> 37:55.220]  any prizes yet. Oh my God. Let's do this. All right. I read that part. I read that part. I read that part.
[37:55.220 --> 37:59.140]  Here we go. Let's get to this paper. Are you guys ready for this? Somebody answer me. All right.
[38:00.500 --> 38:05.060]  So on episode 50, we gave some instructions on how you guys could win some great prizes.
[38:06.020 --> 38:14.180]  I'm going to go from the bottom here. On Instagram, I posted an Irie hat pin. So this, these are,
[38:14.180 --> 38:18.980]  I'm just going to do it kind of quickly. These are the Instagram prize winners going from the bottom,
[38:18.980 --> 38:27.860]  the Irie hat pin was won by not you again, 83. Irie hat pin, not you again, 83 from Instagram.
[38:27.860 --> 38:34.340]  The highly educated titanium t-shirt was won by logistics. The white Irie genetics t-shirt
[38:34.340 --> 38:41.140]  enlarge the winner is Bob rennet. The black Irie genetics t-shirt and extra large is one by
[38:41.140 --> 38:47.220]  dabbing mile high, the garden of weed and package, which features a sweet pendant by ghost cat glass,
[38:47.220 --> 38:52.820]  a garden of weed and t-shirt and some stickers that is one by Rasta Ralph. Congratulations.
[38:52.820 --> 38:58.580]  Rasta Ralph. I will say this guy's Rasta Ralph is a friend of ours. I know him, but the contest said,
[38:58.580 --> 39:02.900]  uh, put a reason why you should win this. And honestly, Rasta Ralph wrote the best reason why
[39:02.900 --> 39:08.340]  he should win that prize, dude. So Rasta Ralph wins, um, our second prize winner. This is the
[39:08.340 --> 39:12.660]  one that is going to be exciting. The second prize winner on Instagram. This is the nutrient package
[39:12.660 --> 39:17.700]  without the grow Kashi and the OGT. This is the second prize, not the grand prize. You guys. So
[39:17.700 --> 39:23.140]  the winner of the second prize package from Instagram is Nate McVillain. So congratulations
[39:23.140 --> 39:28.500]  to all of my Instagram winners, Nate McVillain, Rasta Ralph, dabbing mile high, Bob rennet,
[39:28.500 --> 39:33.940]  logistics, and not you again, 83. Here's what you do to claim your prize. I need you to email me
[39:33.940 --> 39:39.060]  at grow from your heart at hotmail.com. Tell me your Instagram name. So I know who the hell you
[39:39.620 --> 39:44.740]  give me your real name and your mailing address. And I will get these prizes to you as soon as I
[39:44.740 --> 39:48.340]  can. It may be, it's going to be a little bit, cause I'm going to try to mail all of them at
[39:48.340 --> 39:52.500]  once. So I don't have to keep going to the post office. But as soon as you guys get me all your
[39:52.500 --> 39:58.100]  info, I can get all the packages out. So Nate McVillain, Rasta Ralph, dabbing mile high, Bob
[39:58.100 --> 40:02.820]  rennet, logistics, and not you again, 83, send me your mailing information. Congratulations. You've
[40:02.820 --> 40:07.540]  got some prizes coming to you. All right, now let's do the Facebook winners. If you guys enter
[40:07.540 --> 40:12.580]  the contest on Facebook, you should be paying attention. The IRIE genetics hat pin will go to
[40:12.580 --> 40:18.420]  Mr. Stuart Coleman. The large IRIE genetics t-shirt goes to my friend, Jake Henry. I don't
[40:18.420 --> 40:24.820]  know Jake, but he's my friend now. The extra large t-shirt goes to Jason Box. The second place prize.
[40:24.820 --> 40:31.140]  This is the prize package without the Grokashi and the OGT. This has, I don't remember what's
[40:31.140 --> 40:34.100]  in there. I'm not going to try to rattle it off. There's stickers, there's nutrients, there's a
[40:34.100 --> 40:40.340]  whole bunch of heavy 16 shit in there. It's a great prize package. The winner is Fred Garvin is
[40:40.340 --> 40:46.420]  the winner of the second place prize package from Facebook. So Fred Garvin, Jason Box, Jake Henry,
[40:46.420 --> 40:52.500]  and Stuart Coleman, please email me growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I've already got your
[40:52.500 --> 40:57.060]  real name here. Just tell me who you are, give me your name and a shipping address where I can send
[40:57.060 --> 41:01.140]  these packages to, and I will get them to you. Don't worry about where I'm shipping it because
[41:01.140 --> 41:06.660]  honestly, this is all just grow merchandise or grow equipment, merchandise gifts. There will not
[41:06.660 --> 41:10.820]  be any IRIE genetic seeds in here. I promise you. We just read an article about shipping shit. I
[41:10.820 --> 41:15.860]  think seeds would be just as bad, probably get me in just as much trouble. So you guys want to know
[41:15.860 --> 41:21.300]  who won the grand prize, right? How do I build suspense? I just go, I'll tell you what's in there.
[41:21.300 --> 41:27.860]  There's a bag of OGT. There's a big ass bag of Grokashi. There are so many bottles of nutrients.
[41:27.860 --> 41:32.500]  There's a bottle of plant catalyst. There's a whole bunch of heavy 16 stuff in there.
[41:33.060 --> 41:40.900]  There are IRIE genetics stickers in there. There is a t-shirt in there. It is heavy. It's going to
[41:40.900 --> 41:45.940]  cost me a lot of money to ship it. So you're lucky I put all that stuff in one prize package. I'm
[41:45.940 --> 41:49.860]  going to do a drum roll on the table here. I don't know if you can hear me. The winner of the grand
[41:49.860 --> 41:55.860]  prize package that was donated to us by our good friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies in Denver
[41:55.860 --> 41:59.700]  and Pueblo, make sure you support Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. The winner of the prize package
[42:00.260 --> 42:06.900]  is none other than Rich Melohan because Rich is awesome. He commented on Facebook and Instagram.
[42:06.900 --> 42:11.540]  He followed the rules. He followed who he needed to follow and his comments were beautiful. So
[42:11.540 --> 42:16.740]  congratulations, Rich. You win a sweet ass prize package from the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[42:16.740 --> 42:22.660]  from IRIE genetics, from Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. This will make you a better grower.
[42:23.300 --> 42:28.420]  You just got the shit that I use. The OGT, the Grokashi, that's in my lineup all the time.
[42:29.060 --> 42:33.460]  So you just want some cool shit. Congratulations. Thank you guys for entering the contest.
[42:34.020 --> 42:38.580]  If you didn't win, I feel bad. I don't like doing contests because that means that somebody didn't
[42:38.580 --> 42:44.820]  win and I feel like shit for that. So if you didn't win, I'm sorry. I feel guilty already.
[42:44.820 --> 42:48.180]  So don't feel bad that you didn't win. It was hard to pick winners. I only had so many prizes
[42:48.180 --> 42:52.580]  and I had a lot of entries. Thank you to everybody that entered the contest. That means a lot to me.
[42:53.140 --> 42:58.740]  Thank you to everybody that listened to the podcast. Episode 50 got more listens than any
[42:58.740 --> 43:06.100]  other show and it pushed us up to 888 in the Stitcher ranks. There are 25,000 shows on Stitcher
[43:06.100 --> 43:09.940]  and this little show that happens here in my kitchen at my dining room table
[43:09.940 --> 43:17.300]  has placed 888 out of 25,000 shows. So I'm kind of proud. It's not me that did that. It's you guys
[43:17.300 --> 43:21.220]  because I don't listen to it. I just produce it and record it and talk into a mic. So thank you
[43:21.220 --> 43:26.100]  guys for doing that. That is super awesome. You guys make sure you email me. Rich, email me. Fred
[43:26.100 --> 43:30.820]  Garvin, Jason Box, Jake Henry, Nate McVillain, Rasta Ralph, Dabin Mile High, Bob Rennet,
[43:30.820 --> 43:38.180]  Logistics, not you again 83. Please email me. Also, there was an extra prize package that I did
[43:38.180 --> 43:41.140]  not list. I'm going to make sure. I'm going to look over there one more time because I realized
[43:41.140 --> 43:46.580]  that there's another prize pack. I'm going to look. Got to peek across the room. There are four
[43:46.580 --> 43:50.820]  bags over there, you guys, and I only gave away three of them. So that meant that I had an extra
[43:50.820 --> 43:58.820]  bag and that extra bag has heavy 16 nutrients. There's iReed genetic stickers in there. There's
[43:58.820 --> 44:03.540]  heavy 16 stickers. There's random shit from Hygro and their growing supplies and I would like to
[44:03.540 --> 44:11.220]  give that bag to El Rocho. He entered on, he entered his comment on Instagram. So El Rocho, bro,
[44:11.220 --> 44:16.260]  I need your contact information. Also, you won the prize that I forgot to list because you commented
[44:16.260 --> 44:20.820]  on the nutrient package. And since there's another one, bro, you get it. So message me and I'll get
[44:20.820 --> 44:25.540]  that to you. It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com, you guys. Talking really fast, huh? I'm going to
[44:25.540 --> 44:29.940]  take a dab. The show's almost over. Let's take a dab together. I had to pause for the last dab
[44:29.940 --> 44:36.980]  because I needed a drink so badly. Get yourselves a dab, guys. I got the email going, so I'm already
[44:36.980 --> 44:43.220]  ahead of you. I'm going to dab some sativa mix that I made. Shout out to the Garden of
[44:43.220 --> 44:47.780]  Weedon and Spence. Big Mike helped a lot. And Michael, those guys have got me making pretty
[44:47.780 --> 44:55.060]  good hash. Thanks a lot. So we're going to take a dab, wrap up the show. All right. Three, two,
[44:55.060 --> 45:11.530]  one. Let's dab, you guys. Might have been bigger than I wanted to take on the podcast, but we'll
[45:11.530 --> 45:16.570]  be all right. All right. So I'm going to tell one quick story before I wrap it up because I just
[45:16.570 --> 45:23.050]  hit my Hitman rig and it made me think of something. Yesterday, iStreet dropped and broke a $300
[45:23.690 --> 45:28.570]  Hitman Phase 2 cake. It hit the table and it just fucking broke. And I know everyone's going,
[45:28.570 --> 45:32.730]  oh my God, really? You broke a $300 rig? Yeah, I did. And I felt like a real dumbass about it.
[45:33.290 --> 45:37.450]  I kind of had like a moment of guilt in my heart for it. And I sat at the table and I was like,
[45:37.450 --> 45:43.930]  you just dropped one of your favorite rigs, dude. And then what do you do? There's broken glass on
[45:43.930 --> 45:47.930]  the table. You can be mad for a minute. You can be brokenhearted, but then you got to grab the
[45:47.930 --> 45:51.930]  broom and the dustpan and sweep up the fucking broken glass. You got to throw that glass in the
[45:51.930 --> 45:57.290]  trash and you got to move on. Right? That's all I could do because it's broken. I can't glue it
[45:57.290 --> 46:03.370]  back together. Duct tape is not going to work. That shit's done. So I had a moment of Zen as I
[46:03.370 --> 46:08.010]  was sweeping up this broken glass. I thought there's so many things that happen in your life
[46:08.010 --> 46:13.450]  that suck and they hurt, or maybe they're good, but you can't cling to things because you could
[46:13.450 --> 46:17.210]  drop that glass at any minute and that shit could break, dude. And you can't put it back together.
[46:17.770 --> 46:22.010]  And sometimes you just got to sweep some shit up, throw it in the trash can and fucking walk away
[46:22.570 --> 46:26.810]  and just move on. So, uh, when you have some shit happen to you, just try to learn something
[46:26.810 --> 46:31.450]  and think about it like that, because I've been stuck on something and breaking that rig
[46:32.730 --> 46:37.050]  was definitely symbolic in some way to me. And I learned something from it. I just wanted to share
[46:37.050 --> 46:41.290]  that with you guys. I broke a rig and I learned a huge life lesson from it that had nothing to do
[46:41.290 --> 46:46.010]  with the rig itself. I just, this moment of Zen came over me and taught me a huge life lesson.
[46:46.810 --> 46:50.090]  Wanted to share that. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you learned something from it. Also,
[46:50.090 --> 46:53.530]  if there's something that you're fucking stuck on that you're clinging to just let it go, dude.
[46:54.330 --> 46:58.730]  I know it's easier said than done, but I dropped a $300 rig and I swept it up and threw it away.
[46:58.730 --> 47:03.290]  There's nothing we can do about it. Just sometimes you got to sweep some shit up and move on. I
[47:03.290 --> 47:08.330]  didn't get cut from the rig and I had fun hitting it when I hit it. So that's all I could do with
[47:08.330 --> 47:11.770]  that being said, you guys, now that the show's over, please go to iTunes or stitcher, go to the
[47:11.770 --> 47:15.610]  iTunes or the stitcher main page, search for the grow from your heart podcast, find the review
[47:15.610 --> 47:19.210]  section. Give me a five-star rating after that type in a comment. Let me know what you think of
[47:19.210 --> 47:22.970]  the show. And I will read your comments on the show. Big shout out to all the people that left
[47:22.970 --> 47:27.130]  comments. I read them at the start of the show. I love it. I really love it. Interacting with you
[47:27.130 --> 47:30.730]  guys makes me feel like you're paying attention. It makes it worth my time and effort. Don't
[47:30.730 --> 47:34.730]  forget that the show is available on iTunes, stitcher, and every single episode is archived
[47:34.730 --> 47:41.770]  on iRegeneticsColorado.com. Don't forget that I've added a donation button to the podcast page. If
[47:41.770 --> 47:46.890]  you go to iRegeneticsColorado.com, you'll have to agree that you're over 18. And then you're
[47:46.890 --> 47:53.210]  going to go to the podcast page. It says grow from your heart podcast. Click on that. In the top right
[47:53.210 --> 47:58.890]  part of the page, there's a PayPal donate button. If you feel that this show was worth a dollar or
[47:58.890 --> 48:03.930]  $5 or however much you felt it was worth, if you want to donate a couple of bucks, go ahead and
[48:03.930 --> 48:08.970]  throw a few dollars in there. And that goes directly to my PayPal account. Right now, my
[48:08.970 --> 48:13.770]  daughter is trying to raise money to go on a Hawaiian educational adventure. Any money that
[48:13.770 --> 48:18.330]  goes to that PayPal account from now until the time that adventure happens, that's where that
[48:18.330 --> 48:22.170]  money goes. That goes to my 11-year-old little girl. So I'm not going to buy a new dab rig. I'm
[48:22.170 --> 48:26.570]  not going to smoke it up. I'm not going to buy a new hat. It's going to my little kid. So if you
[48:26.570 --> 48:29.770]  want to contribute to the show, I appreciate it. I'm not begging. The only reason I put it there
[48:29.770 --> 48:34.090]  is because a listener said if I had it, he would contribute. So if you haven't contributed, bro,
[48:34.090 --> 48:39.130]  I'm letting you know it's there. Just got to be in a smart ass with that. Yeah, follow Iree
