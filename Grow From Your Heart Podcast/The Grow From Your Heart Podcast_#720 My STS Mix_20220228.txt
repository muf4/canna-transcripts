[00:00.830 --> 00:24.840]  All right, here we go.
[00:24.840 --> 00:26.480]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:26.480 --> 00:27.480]  I'm your host.
[00:27.480 --> 00:28.960]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:28.960 --> 00:34.560]  This is episode 720 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:34.560 --> 00:39.520]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about making your own spray to make your own fem seeds.
[00:39.520 --> 00:43.380]  Before I get to that part, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who
[00:43.380 --> 00:46.920]  continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:46.920 --> 00:49.500]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:49.500 --> 00:50.500]  Thank you.
[00:50.500 --> 00:51.840]  Shout out to my friend Frankie.
[00:51.840 --> 00:55.780]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Stash Drop 269 and Tartan Mike.
[00:55.780 --> 00:59.760]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Jethro Earl and All Mixed Up.
[00:59.760 --> 01:01.920]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Uncle Gigi.
[01:01.920 --> 01:04.440]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Chicago Dabber.
[01:04.440 --> 01:08.240]  I want to send a big thank you to my buddy Pro Brewer Home Grower.
[01:08.240 --> 01:11.240]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to another good friend, my buddy Crazy
[01:11.240 --> 01:12.560]  Hand Grows.
[01:12.560 --> 01:14.440]  Let's send a thank you shout out to a friend with weed.
[01:14.440 --> 01:17.340]  I want to send a big fist bump to Sam Heads.
[01:17.340 --> 01:19.600]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Sinti11.
[01:19.600 --> 01:22.720]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:22.720 --> 01:23.720]  Thank you.
[01:23.720 --> 01:26.380]  Shout out to my friend Tree Star Meadow.
[01:26.380 --> 01:31.320]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:31.320 --> 01:35.400]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:35.400 --> 01:42.000]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.880]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:44.880 --> 01:49.240]  And you know, I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:49.240 --> 01:53.280]  it nice and easy for all of my friends to find the Patreon page.
[01:53.280 --> 01:58.720]  All right, I'm going to do a quick episode about making your own silver thiosulfate solution.
[01:58.720 --> 02:01.040]  This is how we do make feminized seeds.
[02:01.040 --> 02:02.680]  I'm actually in the middle of a workday.
[02:02.680 --> 02:04.280]  I was doing work, putting stuff together.
[02:04.640 --> 02:06.200]  I was like, I need to mix up that solution.
[02:06.200 --> 02:07.840]  I should spray these plants today.
[02:07.840 --> 02:09.160]  Today is the day.
[02:09.160 --> 02:13.120]  And then I thought to myself, what kind of podcaster would I be if I did not set up some
[02:13.120 --> 02:17.480]  cameras, throw up a microphone here and get this episode recorded.
[02:17.480 --> 02:23.040]  So we're going to record myself making, I'm going to record myself making a silver thiosulfate
[02:23.040 --> 02:24.040]  solution.
[02:24.040 --> 02:28.000]  This will be used to make the next batch of Fem seeds that come from iRegenetics.
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.160]  This is the solution I am going to use.
[02:30.160 --> 02:35.400]  You're going to watch me make my actual solution, which I use for making feminized seeds.
[02:35.400 --> 02:39.840]  There are a lot of things we should talk about before we show you how to make this solution,
[02:39.840 --> 02:42.600]  but I feel like I've talked about those things many times.
[02:42.600 --> 02:48.260]  I've given many other podcast episodes about the precursors, the prerequisites to making
[02:48.260 --> 02:50.480]  your solution and to selecting your plants.
[02:50.480 --> 02:55.200]  Briefly, I will say this, selection is very important when it comes to making feminized
[02:55.200 --> 02:56.200]  plants.
[02:56.200 --> 02:58.360]  You want true female plants.
[02:58.360 --> 03:02.000]  If you're going to make a feminized plant, if you're going to reverse a plant, pick a
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.960]  plant that you know is a true female.
[03:03.960 --> 03:06.160]  We want a plant that has been tested.
[03:06.160 --> 03:10.400]  Give it some light stress, give it feeding stress, maybe not all at once or do, but let's
[03:10.400 --> 03:13.040]  see if that plant shows you intersex traits.
[03:13.040 --> 03:19.480]  I do not and will not make feminized plants, feminized seeds from any plants that ever
[03:19.480 --> 03:22.400]  show me any type of intersex traits.
[03:22.400 --> 03:28.680]  Let's remove the word intersex, herm, hermaphrodite, especially eliminate the word hermy from our
[03:28.680 --> 03:33.520]  vocabulary when it comes to talking about fem seeds and fem seed production.
[03:33.520 --> 03:35.800]  There is no hermaphroditism happening here.
[03:35.800 --> 03:40.680]  There are no hermaphroditic plants being used if we're using silver in the correct manner.
[03:40.680 --> 03:42.080]  Now I can move forward.
[03:42.080 --> 03:43.440]  Let's stop saying herm.
[03:43.440 --> 03:44.440]  Let's use the right words.
[03:44.440 --> 03:45.440]  It is not a hermaphrodite.
[03:45.440 --> 03:48.800]  I would throw hermaphrodite away, so that's not what we are doing.
[03:48.800 --> 03:52.520]  Now I can talk about a few of the options when we are making fem seeds.
[03:52.520 --> 03:55.520]  There are selfed plants, there are reversed plants.
[03:55.520 --> 03:58.680]  What we are going to do, what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a solution of silver
[03:58.680 --> 04:00.080]  thiosulfate.
[04:00.080 --> 04:03.320]  Also my chemistry nerd friend says I say that incorrectly.
[04:03.320 --> 04:06.080]  If you think I say it wrong, politely do correct me.
[04:06.080 --> 04:09.880]  Also I do apologize for the rough voice here, the raspy throat.
[04:09.880 --> 04:11.240]  I was not prepared to record.
[04:11.240 --> 04:15.760]  I was actually in the middle of my work day, so this is not recording normal time.
[04:15.760 --> 04:16.760]  My voice is not prepared.
[04:16.760 --> 04:17.760]  I may have been dabbing.
[04:17.760 --> 04:19.480]  I may have been doing other things.
[04:19.480 --> 04:21.680]  The voice wasn't ready, so I apologize.
[04:21.680 --> 04:22.680]  Free show.
[04:22.680 --> 04:23.680]  I love you.
[04:23.680 --> 04:24.680]  You're welcome.
[04:24.680 --> 04:25.680]  Don't complain.
[04:25.680 --> 04:26.680]  It may be silver thiosulfate.
[04:26.680 --> 04:30.840]  If it's thio, thio, either way it's going to do the same shit.
[04:30.840 --> 04:32.120]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[04:32.120 --> 04:33.120]  Where was I?
[04:33.120 --> 04:37.120]  I'm going to mix up this solution and I'm going to reverse one plant.
[04:37.120 --> 04:40.280]  I'm actually going to reverse three different clones of the same plant.
[04:40.280 --> 04:44.300]  We're going to put that pollen on multiple other females.
[04:44.300 --> 04:48.620]  When I put that pollen on a cut of the same plant, I'm going to reverse golden goat.
[04:48.620 --> 04:53.100]  Full disclosure, I'm going to reverse a golden goat female, three golden goat females to
[04:53.100 --> 04:55.060]  make a lot of pollen.
[04:55.060 --> 04:57.460]  I'm going to put that pollen on another golden goat.
[04:57.460 --> 05:01.300]  Of course, that will make golden goat S1, self golden goats.
[05:01.300 --> 05:05.540]  I will also put that pollen on a platinum tangy plant and a lemon skunk.
[05:05.540 --> 05:08.020]  We will then make orange gasm and lemon Jeffrey.
[05:08.020 --> 05:11.100]  There may be other bitches in the room that we can't talk about.
[05:11.100 --> 05:14.380]  They're going to get pollinated as well, but let's stay focused here.
[05:14.380 --> 05:18.000]  The other plants that get pollinated that are not golden goat will be what are known
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.780]  as reversals, R1s and S1s.
[05:20.780 --> 05:22.980]  We're going to self a plant, use its own pollen.
[05:22.980 --> 05:25.600]  Then we're going to self that plant, put it on other plants.
[05:25.600 --> 05:26.600]  That is a reversal.
[05:26.600 --> 05:28.260]  I've done full episodes on that.
[05:28.260 --> 05:31.260]  Wanted to give a little background, a little prerequisite.
[05:31.260 --> 05:35.220]  Now let's talk more about making this solution.
[05:35.220 --> 05:37.140]  We're going to be working with chemicals.
[05:37.140 --> 05:38.560]  I've got these chemicals here in my face.
[05:38.560 --> 05:40.060]  Let me move the iPad a little bit over.
[05:40.060 --> 05:42.240]  I had that mainly for the shout outs.
[05:42.240 --> 05:43.240]  Let me check the recording.
[05:43.240 --> 05:44.820]  It looks like things are going well.
[05:44.820 --> 05:45.820]  Should be a good show.
[05:45.820 --> 05:48.300]  It's weird with the new mic placement and the iPad in the wrong place.
[05:48.300 --> 05:49.300]  I'm out of my comfort zone.
[05:49.300 --> 05:52.220]  We're going to do the best we can with this new setup.
[05:52.220 --> 05:53.220]  Where were we?
[05:53.220 --> 05:54.220]  Let's talk about this stuff.
[05:54.220 --> 05:55.540]  We're going to be using chemicals.
[05:55.540 --> 06:01.860]  I do have a bottle of sodium, theo or thiosulfate, sodium thiosulfate.
[06:01.860 --> 06:02.860]  I'll show that to the camera.
[06:02.860 --> 06:04.040]  I will zoom in on that.
[06:04.040 --> 06:05.040]  Maybe that camera is better.
[06:05.040 --> 06:06.420]  I'll get the best angle for the show.
[06:06.420 --> 06:09.740]  I promise you and we'll fix it in post is what we're going to say here.
[06:10.420 --> 06:11.420]  I'll show you that.
[06:11.420 --> 06:12.740]  We've got this bottle here.
[06:12.740 --> 06:15.660]  We've also got this bottle of silver nitrate.
[06:15.660 --> 06:17.180]  I'm showing that to this camera.
[06:17.180 --> 06:20.060]  I'm going to hold it up here for a couple of seconds, let you take a look at it.
[06:20.060 --> 06:21.060]  Show it to this camera.
[06:21.060 --> 06:23.460]  We'll see which one gives us the better view in post.
[06:23.460 --> 06:25.020]  The cameras are kind of far away.
[06:25.020 --> 06:27.540]  We'll edit that to be appropriate.
[06:27.540 --> 06:32.660]  These chemicals, I do buy them from a company called United Nuclear on the internet.
[06:32.660 --> 06:35.540]  United nuclear.com is how I think I find them.
[06:35.540 --> 06:36.540]  You can find them.
[06:36.540 --> 06:37.540]  They're very easy to find.
[06:37.620 --> 06:43.460]  I buy the two ounces of sodium thiosulfate and the 10 grams of silver nitrate.
[06:43.460 --> 06:44.540]  They're very affordable.
[06:44.540 --> 06:45.740]  One is almost still full.
[06:45.740 --> 06:47.020]  This one's almost empty.
[06:47.020 --> 06:48.020]  There's another bottle inside.
[06:48.020 --> 06:49.020]  There's why it rattles.
[06:49.020 --> 06:51.140]  They give you the double seal.
[06:51.140 --> 06:53.060]  Very cost effective, very affordable.
[06:53.060 --> 06:54.460]  These are very cheap products.
[06:54.460 --> 06:56.620]  However, they could be caustic.
[06:56.620 --> 06:57.620]  They could be dangerous.
[06:57.620 --> 07:00.540]  They've got a bunch of notices written on the sides of them.
[07:00.540 --> 07:03.320]  You've got to be very careful when you're using these products.
[07:03.320 --> 07:04.580]  Something I highly recommend.
[07:04.580 --> 07:06.860]  One thing I'll start off with, I like to dab a lot.
[07:06.860 --> 07:07.860]  I like to smoke a lot.
[07:07.860 --> 07:11.180]  If you're not a safe person, if you're not comfortable doing shit, blaze.
[07:11.180 --> 07:12.580]  Don't do this when you're high.
[07:12.580 --> 07:13.940]  Maybe get a clear head.
[07:13.940 --> 07:15.780]  Maybe wait till after you do this to smoke.
[07:15.780 --> 07:18.820]  Maybe mix up your shit, then smoke in celebration.
[07:18.820 --> 07:19.980]  That's something I should mention.
[07:19.980 --> 07:21.720]  I'm not your boss, bro.
[07:21.720 --> 07:25.220]  My rule of thumb at work, if I'm the boss, is if I can tell you're high, you're too high.
[07:25.220 --> 07:28.580]  If I can't tell you're high, do your fucking job and have a good time.
[07:28.580 --> 07:30.340]  That applies to you right now.
[07:30.340 --> 07:31.340]  Don't fuck this up.
[07:31.340 --> 07:32.340]  Don't get these chemicals.
[07:32.340 --> 07:33.340]  Don't inhale these chemicals.
[07:33.340 --> 07:34.340]  Don't ingest these chemicals.
[07:34.340 --> 07:35.340]  Don't get them in your eyes.
[07:35.340 --> 07:36.420]  Be very careful.
[07:36.980 --> 07:40.020]  The first thing I'm going to do to be a good example, to be a good leader, I'm going to
[07:40.020 --> 07:41.820]  put on my gloves.
[07:41.820 --> 07:43.100]  You guys ready for your exam?
[07:43.100 --> 07:44.100]  I hope you're ready.
[07:44.100 --> 07:45.100]  Line up.
[07:45.100 --> 07:46.700]  Then after that, we're going to make some solution here.
[07:46.700 --> 07:48.340]  I've got my gloves coming on.
[07:48.340 --> 07:51.220]  I hate it when the hands are all clammy and the gloves won't go on.
[07:51.220 --> 07:53.300]  These are the right size gloves and they fit just right.
[07:53.300 --> 07:54.900]  We're going to put on some gloves.
[07:54.900 --> 07:57.340]  Normally, when I'm doing this, I would wear a mask.
[07:57.340 --> 07:59.580]  I'm going to do things differently.
[07:59.580 --> 08:01.460]  I already poured the chemicals.
[08:01.460 --> 08:03.060]  I already weighed them.
[08:03.060 --> 08:06.340]  I've got them stored right here next to me so that I don't have to waste time doing that
[08:06.380 --> 08:07.380]  on camera.
[08:07.380 --> 08:09.300]  Also, I would normally wear a mask to do that.
[08:09.300 --> 08:13.060]  However, a mask and a podcast and a camera and a microphone seemed stupid to me.
[08:13.060 --> 08:14.060]  I don't want to do that.
[08:14.060 --> 08:18.780]  Honestly, the mask seems silly to me at this point, but this is not a political show.
[08:18.780 --> 08:20.300]  I would get the gloves and the mask.
[08:20.300 --> 08:23.540]  I would also tie up the dreadlocks, but the way that I had them tied with the big hat,
[08:23.540 --> 08:24.700]  it didn't work with the headphones.
[08:24.700 --> 08:26.820]  We're adjusting.
[08:26.820 --> 08:28.540]  Do as I say and not as I do.
[08:28.540 --> 08:29.540]  Protect yourself.
[08:29.540 --> 08:30.540]  Take care of yourself.
[08:30.540 --> 08:33.460]  Eyewear may be a good idea if you're a clumsy fuck, but that's not necessary in my opinion
[08:33.460 --> 08:34.460]  right here.
[08:34.460 --> 08:35.940]  It's a powdered chemical.
[08:36.540 --> 08:39.060]  However, again, if you're a clumsy fuck, get that eyewear.
[08:39.060 --> 08:40.060]  It's dangerous.
[08:40.060 --> 08:41.060]  You could get shit in your eyes.
[08:41.060 --> 08:42.060]  Maybe eyewear.
[08:42.060 --> 08:47.380]  Rasta Jeff says, wear eye protection just because legally I don't want to get in trouble, bro.
[08:47.380 --> 08:48.380]  Wear your eyewear, dude.
[08:48.380 --> 08:49.380]  Wear your gloves.
[08:49.380 --> 08:50.380]  Wear your mask.
[08:50.380 --> 08:51.380]  Tie up your dreadlocks.
[08:51.380 --> 08:52.380]  Tie up your hair.
[08:52.380 --> 08:53.380]  Tie up your loose sleeves.
[08:53.380 --> 08:58.100]  If you've got wobbly sleeves, now's the time to get the wizard sleeve tied up.
[08:58.100 --> 08:59.900]  Sorry about that.
[08:59.900 --> 09:00.900]  Where are we?
[09:00.900 --> 09:01.900]  Tie up your dreads.
[09:01.900 --> 09:05.620]  Also, work in an area where if you spill some shit, it's going to be safe.
[09:06.300 --> 09:09.260]  Make sure you've got your iPad, your recording equipment, your power supply.
[09:09.260 --> 09:10.580]  Make sure all that shit is scale.
[09:10.580 --> 09:12.140]  Make sure that's all on the same table.
[09:12.140 --> 09:13.140]  Don't really do that.
[09:13.140 --> 09:14.580]  I'm doing that for a video.
[09:14.580 --> 09:17.860]  Like I said before, do as I say, not as I do.
[09:17.860 --> 09:19.180]  The podcast area would be perfect.
[09:19.180 --> 09:21.380]  Make sure you've got a lot of electronic shit is what I wrote.
[09:21.380 --> 09:25.940]  Also, I may recommend have some paper towels or a rag or something available.
[09:25.940 --> 09:27.740]  We're going to have some water pouring here.
[09:27.740 --> 09:29.260]  Things could go awry.
[09:29.260 --> 09:31.900]  Like I keep saying, I'm not a Jedi.
[09:31.900 --> 09:32.900]  I'm not a ninja.
[09:32.900 --> 09:33.900]  I'm not perfect.
[09:33.900 --> 09:34.900]  Also, not a clumsy fuck.
[09:35.180 --> 09:36.180]  I'm not going to get in the middle of that.
[09:36.180 --> 09:37.180]  So I do need a rag occasionally.
[09:37.180 --> 09:39.300]  Going to have to clean some shit up.
[09:39.300 --> 09:41.260]  Now, let's get down to business.
[09:41.260 --> 09:43.820]  Let's talk about mixing this solution.
[09:43.820 --> 09:44.820]  What do I have in front of me?
[09:44.820 --> 09:47.740]  We talked about the two products, the silver and the sodium.
[09:47.740 --> 09:53.420]  I've got to scale because I'm going to weigh these two products in a very specific amount.
[09:53.420 --> 09:56.940]  I need a half a gram of one and two and a half grams of another.
[09:56.940 --> 10:03.220]  Then I'm going to put those into 500 milliliters of distilled water.
[10:03.220 --> 10:04.220]  I've got distilled water.
[10:04.540 --> 10:05.940]  I've got a gallon jug of distilled water over here.
[10:05.940 --> 10:06.940]  I'll hold that up for the camera.
[10:06.940 --> 10:08.700]  I can't find the handle of the bottle.
[10:08.700 --> 10:09.700]  There we go.
[10:09.700 --> 10:10.700]  I got a gallon jug.
[10:10.700 --> 10:13.140]  Just distilled water, plain distilled water.
[10:13.140 --> 10:15.260]  I try not to let it sit around too long.
[10:15.260 --> 10:18.380]  I get a fresh one most of the time when I'm making the solution.
[10:18.380 --> 10:21.780]  So we've got a gallon of distilled water over here.
[10:21.780 --> 10:26.340]  I've poured that into two 500 milliliter measuring glasses.
[10:26.340 --> 10:28.860]  I'm just going to slide these closer to the camera view.
[10:28.860 --> 10:31.780]  They're both filled with 500 milliliters of water.
[10:31.780 --> 10:32.780]  It's the distilled water.
[10:32.780 --> 10:33.780]  Hold that up for the camera here.
[10:34.340 --> 10:35.340]  There you go.
[10:35.340 --> 10:36.340]  Right up to the 500 millimark.
[10:36.340 --> 10:39.060]  So I have a liter of water here essentially divided evenly.
[10:39.060 --> 10:40.100]  I've got my two powders.
[10:40.100 --> 10:43.540]  The way I would do this, and like I said, I skipped a step because of the camera, because
[10:43.540 --> 10:46.300]  of the mask, because of technology and to speed shit up.
[10:46.300 --> 10:48.180]  Probably talked right my way through speed and shit up.
[10:48.180 --> 10:51.300]  But what we're going to do, we're going to, I used a piece of paper.
[10:51.300 --> 10:55.840]  I just took a piece of paper and I folded it in half to make it easier to handle.
[10:55.840 --> 10:58.920]  Sometimes if you don't fold the paper, it arches the other way and you lose your solution.
[10:58.920 --> 11:02.880]  So I simply took a piece of paper, folded it in half.
[11:02.980 --> 11:05.960]  I set that piece of paper on the scale.
[11:05.960 --> 11:06.960]  Then I hit tear.
[11:06.960 --> 11:08.960]  Now my scale is at zero at this point.
[11:08.960 --> 11:13.180]  I sprinkled the product on there until I reached the desired amount.
[11:13.180 --> 11:16.560]  In this case, I was using the silver nitrate.
[11:16.560 --> 11:17.760]  This is where the recipe comes in.
[11:17.760 --> 11:18.760]  Pay attention.
[11:18.760 --> 11:24.800]  We've got 500 milliliters of water and I used one half of a gram of silver nitrate.
[11:24.800 --> 11:25.800]  Okay.
[11:25.800 --> 11:28.040]  We're going to just set the silver nitrate right in front of here.
[11:28.040 --> 11:29.920]  That is the silver nitrate container.
[11:29.920 --> 11:31.260]  What I'm going to do at this time.
[11:31.260 --> 11:32.260]  So I've weighed it, right?
[11:32.640 --> 11:33.640]  I've weighed it out.
[11:33.640 --> 11:34.640]  Sprinkle, sprinkle.
[11:34.640 --> 11:35.640]  You saw me do it.
[11:35.640 --> 11:36.640]  I got a half a gram right here.
[11:36.640 --> 11:37.640]  You trust me?
[11:37.640 --> 11:38.640]  Do you want to see the scale or do you trust my weight, bro?
[11:38.640 --> 11:39.640]  I promise you I tore it.
[11:39.640 --> 11:40.640]  I teared the scale.
[11:40.640 --> 11:41.640]  What's the word?
[11:41.640 --> 11:43.140]  I tore, I teared, prefixed the scale.
[11:43.140 --> 11:45.420]  I don't know the word.
[11:45.420 --> 11:46.600]  Someone will tell me.
[11:46.600 --> 11:49.900]  So right here I do have half of a gram of silver nitrate.
[11:49.900 --> 11:51.340]  I don't know if it'll come up on camera.
[11:51.340 --> 11:53.920]  I'm not going to fucking finagle it and spill it.
[11:53.920 --> 11:55.660]  It's not expensive, but it's right here.
[11:55.660 --> 11:56.660]  I need it.
[11:56.660 --> 11:58.140]  So I'm going to dump that right into the water.
[11:58.140 --> 11:59.220]  I'm going to tap my paper.
[11:59.220 --> 12:01.020]  Just get that all into the water.
[12:01.020 --> 12:02.620]  It's in there.
[12:02.620 --> 12:05.180]  There is an imaginary trash can right over there.
[12:05.180 --> 12:06.580]  I know I've got some shit over there to clean up.
[12:06.580 --> 12:08.020]  So we're just going to put that over there.
[12:08.020 --> 12:10.700]  Here I'm going to use a very technical piece of equipment.
[12:10.700 --> 12:12.980]  This we call a butter knife.
[12:12.980 --> 12:14.180]  I like this because it's metal.
[12:14.180 --> 12:15.340]  Nothing sticks to it.
[12:15.340 --> 12:16.340]  It's easy to clean up.
[12:16.340 --> 12:17.460]  I'm going to put that in here.
[12:17.460 --> 12:19.100]  I'm going to stir my shit gently.
[12:19.100 --> 12:20.420]  I almost went too hard.
[12:20.420 --> 12:21.420]  Just want this to dissolve.
[12:21.420 --> 12:23.180]  It should dissolve pretty quickly.
[12:23.180 --> 12:25.460]  The product was chunky, so it may take a couple of seconds.
[12:25.460 --> 12:28.260]  You got a couple of fat rocks in there that need to dissolve.
[12:28.260 --> 12:29.260]  It's going.
[12:29.260 --> 12:30.500]  It's almost dissolved completely.
[12:30.540 --> 12:33.580]  I can see by looking through the glass here, it's gone.
[12:33.580 --> 12:35.260]  It's basically dissolved in there.
[12:35.260 --> 12:36.580]  So that part is taken care of.
[12:36.580 --> 12:37.980]  I'm going to set that there for a moment,
[12:37.980 --> 12:39.460]  get myself a paper towel.
[12:41.140 --> 12:44.220]  Then I'm just going to fold it up nice and scientifically.
[12:44.220 --> 12:46.660]  And then we're just going to clean this off.
[12:46.660 --> 12:47.500]  All right.
[12:47.500 --> 12:48.660]  The first part has been handled.
[12:48.660 --> 12:49.580]  We've done the first part.
[12:49.580 --> 12:51.260]  Just leave that there just because it's safe there.
[12:51.260 --> 12:52.100]  I know where it is.
[12:52.100 --> 12:52.940]  It's not fucking anything up.
[12:52.940 --> 12:56.020]  So the next step, excuse me for the throat clearing.
[12:56.020 --> 12:57.220]  We already did this disclaimer.
[12:57.220 --> 13:00.020]  Next step, we're going to basically repeat the process
[13:00.060 --> 13:02.260]  with the sodium thiosulfate.
[13:02.260 --> 13:06.260]  For this product, we need 2.5 grams.
[13:06.260 --> 13:08.180]  So I'm going to set that right in front of here.
[13:08.180 --> 13:09.820]  I'm not sure how much of that's coming up on camera.
[13:09.820 --> 13:11.380]  It's far away for me to see.
[13:11.380 --> 13:12.860]  I did already pre-weigh it,
[13:12.860 --> 13:15.420]  but just for science purposes and video purposes,
[13:15.420 --> 13:17.100]  I'll set it right there.
[13:17.100 --> 13:18.780]  Actually, I'll take it off.
[13:18.780 --> 13:20.700]  I will refresh the scale.
[13:20.700 --> 13:21.540]  It's refreshing.
[13:21.540 --> 13:23.180]  It's going to zero.
[13:23.180 --> 13:24.700]  All right, it's at zero.
[13:24.700 --> 13:25.540]  It's taking a minute.
[13:25.540 --> 13:26.380]  There we go.
[13:26.380 --> 13:27.340]  I got shy on camera.
[13:27.340 --> 13:28.260]  It's at zero.
[13:28.260 --> 13:29.780]  We'll set it on here.
[13:30.540 --> 13:31.700]  Hypothetically, I would tear it right now, right?
[13:31.700 --> 13:34.500]  I hit the tear button because I put the paper on there.
[13:34.500 --> 13:36.100]  Now I would sprinkle my product onto there
[13:36.100 --> 13:37.780]  until it says 2.5 grams.
[13:37.780 --> 13:38.620]  I've already done that.
[13:38.620 --> 13:40.180]  So I know it's 2.5.
[13:40.180 --> 13:42.460]  What I can do now, pick up my product.
[13:42.460 --> 13:45.540]  This is container B, sprinkle it right into container B.
[13:45.540 --> 13:47.740]  This one slid right off the paper real well.
[13:47.740 --> 13:49.660]  Just for fun, I'm going to set that on there.
[13:49.660 --> 13:51.740]  It shows me that as negative 2.5.
[13:51.740 --> 13:53.460]  So I know I started at the right point.
[13:53.460 --> 13:54.940]  I know that that's the right amount.
[13:54.940 --> 13:56.100]  I'm going to fold this up,
[13:56.100 --> 13:58.200]  toss it into the imaginary trash can,
[13:58.200 --> 13:59.700]  brush this off of the table here.
[14:00.540 --> 14:01.380]  We should probably clean up a little better.
[14:01.380 --> 14:02.980]  If you're doing this at home, clean up a little better.
[14:02.980 --> 14:04.020]  Don't leave shit on your table,
[14:04.020 --> 14:06.680]  especially if it's like the family table
[14:06.680 --> 14:08.540]  where a pet, a friend, a child could be.
[14:08.540 --> 14:09.380]  Clean the fuck up.
[14:09.380 --> 14:12.060]  Also, here's another point that I kind of maybe skipped.
[14:12.060 --> 14:13.760]  Clean your shit before we start.
[14:14.900 --> 14:17.820]  I cleaned this bottle, this bottle, or this cup,
[14:17.820 --> 14:19.260]  measuring cup, yeah, it's a cup.
[14:19.260 --> 14:20.220]  I cleaned the measuring cup.
[14:20.220 --> 14:21.660]  I cleaned my next jar.
[14:21.660 --> 14:22.940]  I cleaned everything with,
[14:22.940 --> 14:25.940]  I cleaned it real well with alcohol, water,
[14:25.940 --> 14:26.780]  let it sit dry.
[14:26.780 --> 14:29.460]  Then I cleaned it with alcohol, let it sit and dry again.
[14:30.220 --> 14:31.060]  I did that about an hour ago.
[14:31.060 --> 14:31.880]  Then I set up the equipment.
[14:31.880 --> 14:33.580]  I cleaned off my scale real good.
[14:33.580 --> 14:34.420]  Everything is clean.
[14:34.420 --> 14:35.680]  My spray bottle is clean.
[14:35.680 --> 14:37.040]  My environment's clean.
[14:37.040 --> 14:39.220]  Everything will be just as clean when I leave.
[14:39.220 --> 14:40.900]  That's something important to think about.
[14:40.900 --> 14:44.180]  At this point, I should be stirring this product into here.
[14:44.180 --> 14:45.900]  This one won't take very long to dissolve.
[14:45.900 --> 14:47.460]  It's pretty much,
[14:47.460 --> 14:48.820]  this one's a little thicker than the other one.
[14:48.820 --> 14:49.660]  It will take a minute.
[14:49.660 --> 14:50.940]  It's pretty much starting to dissolve already.
[14:50.940 --> 14:53.540]  I could see the cloud at the bottom is going away.
[14:53.540 --> 14:55.940]  At this point, we can remove the scale from the equation.
[14:55.940 --> 14:57.260]  We don't need that.
[14:57.460 --> 14:59.980]  I've got my paper towel here in case I make a mess.
[14:59.980 --> 15:00.820]  Got more trash.
[15:00.820 --> 15:02.020]  Let's just toss that to the other
[15:02.020 --> 15:03.860]  hypothetical invisible trash can.
[15:03.860 --> 15:05.780]  We're gonna keep stirring this.
[15:05.780 --> 15:06.740]  This will dissolve.
[15:06.740 --> 15:08.480]  I may fast forward part of this.
[15:11.100 --> 15:12.460]  Now, once these dissolve,
[15:12.460 --> 15:14.760]  we're going to simply combine them.
[15:14.760 --> 15:16.180]  I'm starting to see that the little crystals
[15:16.180 --> 15:17.820]  at the bottom are disappearing.
[15:17.820 --> 15:19.500]  There's just a little bit left to stir,
[15:19.500 --> 15:21.540]  maybe a little vigorous, a little more vigor.
[15:21.540 --> 15:22.380]  Don't spill it.
[15:22.380 --> 15:23.940]  I did spill it, fill it right up to the top here,
[15:23.940 --> 15:25.380]  but I needed the 500 mils.
[15:25.380 --> 15:26.480]  And wait till you see me fit it
[15:26.480 --> 15:27.760]  into the one liter jar.
[15:27.760 --> 15:28.720]  That's gonna be the fun part.
[15:28.720 --> 15:30.220]  Some of it will get spilled.
[15:30.220 --> 15:31.420]  So we're gonna clean this off again.
[15:31.420 --> 15:32.720]  We don't need the knife.
[15:32.720 --> 15:33.600]  We don't need the scale.
[15:33.600 --> 15:34.840]  We don't need my little wiper towel.
[15:34.840 --> 15:36.980]  So those are gonna go over here out of my way.
[15:36.980 --> 15:38.360]  Make my OCD shine.
[15:38.360 --> 15:40.960]  Get all the used shit that I don't need over there.
[15:40.960 --> 15:42.120]  Now, where are we?
[15:42.120 --> 15:43.240]  We have mixed up our shit.
[15:43.240 --> 15:45.260]  Once again, if you're doing this at your space
[15:45.260 --> 15:46.940]  and you're not recording and have headphones on,
[15:46.940 --> 15:47.960]  get your dreadlocks tied up.
[15:47.960 --> 15:49.380]  Get your long hair out of the way.
[15:49.380 --> 15:50.640]  Have your mask on.
[15:50.640 --> 15:52.480]  At this point, the mask may not be necessary.
[15:52.480 --> 15:54.320]  The dry powdered chemicals are gone.
[15:54.320 --> 15:56.440]  This is where you wanna think about your eye protection.
[15:57.280 --> 15:58.120]  Always use the gloves.
[15:58.120 --> 15:59.840]  These chemicals, I think they're slightly caustic.
[15:59.840 --> 16:01.520]  They could burn up your fingers, burn up your skin.
[16:01.520 --> 16:02.700]  I don't wanna risk it.
[16:02.700 --> 16:05.700]  So we have got the two things mixed together.
[16:05.700 --> 16:08.640]  Now, in science, you always pour,
[16:08.640 --> 16:11.080]  I wrote this down because I always mix this part up.
[16:11.080 --> 16:13.340]  You always pour part A into part B
[16:13.340 --> 16:15.180]  when you are mixing things.
[16:15.180 --> 16:17.360]  This is part A, this is part B.
[16:17.360 --> 16:19.340]  So what I think we should do,
[16:19.340 --> 16:20.800]  normally, honestly, what I normally do
[16:20.800 --> 16:22.300]  is I pour them in here together.
[16:22.300 --> 16:24.120]  So I'm gonna move the iPad over just a little bit
[16:24.120 --> 16:25.880]  because I am a catastrophe once in a while.
[16:26.320 --> 16:27.400]  I'm gonna move the mic out of the way.
[16:27.400 --> 16:29.520]  I'm gonna pour parts A and B in here together,
[16:29.520 --> 16:31.020]  kind of simultaneously at the same time.
[16:31.020 --> 16:32.920]  I feel like that mixes them real well.
[16:32.920 --> 16:34.360]  We'll see how they fit in here.
[16:34.360 --> 16:35.560]  And then once I've got that done,
[16:35.560 --> 16:37.580]  I'll bring the mic back and we'll continue on
[16:37.580 --> 16:40.120]  with our normally scheduled program.
[16:40.120 --> 16:41.520]  Just gonna move those out of the way,
[16:41.520 --> 16:43.240]  move the mic over and we'll get to action.
[16:43.240 --> 16:44.080]  Here we go.
[16:56.160 --> 16:57.420]  All right, through the magic of editing,
[16:57.420 --> 16:58.620]  I did speed that up a little bit
[16:58.620 --> 16:59.760]  so you didn't have to watch me
[16:59.760 --> 17:01.040]  try to slowly pour that in there
[17:01.040 --> 17:02.720]  and then dribble some onto the table.
[17:02.720 --> 17:04.380]  Anyway, here we go.
[17:05.220 --> 17:06.060]  It mostly fit.
[17:06.060 --> 17:07.460]  I've got equal parts left over in both containers.
[17:07.460 --> 17:09.620]  So my ratios are still correct.
[17:09.620 --> 17:11.620]  Close enough, in my opinion, that's gonna be just fine.
[17:11.620 --> 17:12.980]  There's a little bit left in each container.
[17:12.980 --> 17:13.800]  I don't wanna spill it.
[17:13.800 --> 17:15.600]  I don't wanna waste it, but they're even.
[17:15.600 --> 17:18.100]  So there's just barely any left in each container here,
[17:18.100 --> 17:20.660]  but this is as close to that that's gonna fit in here
[17:20.660 --> 17:22.700]  without starting to spill it all over the table.
[17:22.700 --> 17:24.020]  So now we've got our solution.
[17:24.020 --> 17:25.940]  This is our one liter
[17:25.940 --> 17:29.260]  of silver thiosulfate concentrated mix.
[17:29.260 --> 17:31.700]  This is 100% dilution here.
[17:31.700 --> 17:33.940]  We cannot apply this directly to the plant.
[17:34.460 --> 17:35.460]  This will cause problems.
[17:35.460 --> 17:36.600]  This will not be success
[17:36.600 --> 17:38.700]  if we apply this directly to the plant.
[17:38.700 --> 17:41.980]  At this point, we do need to dilute this product.
[17:41.980 --> 17:44.380]  The dilutions and application intervals
[17:44.380 --> 17:46.700]  are where this becomes kind of an art,
[17:46.700 --> 17:48.180]  kind of an adjustment.
[17:48.180 --> 17:52.680]  The same dilution rate and application times and intervals
[17:52.680 --> 17:56.360]  are not going to work for every single plant.
[17:56.360 --> 17:57.580]  There are things to learn.
[17:57.580 --> 17:59.700]  This is just like working with people.
[17:59.700 --> 18:01.300]  It's just like taking somebody on a date.
[18:01.300 --> 18:02.820]  Will it work for your last date?
[18:02.820 --> 18:04.820]  It may not work at all for your next date.
[18:04.820 --> 18:06.260]  So you're gonna have to figure this out.
[18:06.260 --> 18:08.460]  There will be, you'll see some success,
[18:08.460 --> 18:11.060]  but to get this perfect, there will be some dialing in.
[18:11.060 --> 18:13.660]  This will be a little bit of a learning process
[18:13.660 --> 18:15.380]  the way that I do it.
[18:15.380 --> 18:16.700]  I get, and I said earlier,
[18:16.700 --> 18:19.400]  I was going to spray three golden goat clones.
[18:19.400 --> 18:22.220]  That's because I'm going to spray them all differently.
[18:22.220 --> 18:23.540]  Let's talk about the ratios.
[18:23.540 --> 18:25.420]  I'm going to spray these golden goat clones
[18:25.420 --> 18:27.080]  because that is the next step.
[18:27.080 --> 18:28.320]  I've got my spray bottle here.
[18:28.320 --> 18:29.160]  I've got a funnel.
[18:29.160 --> 18:30.040]  I don't have the funnel with me,
[18:30.040 --> 18:31.640]  so I've already failed myself.
[18:31.640 --> 18:34.000]  I do have a workaround to where we can make this work.
[18:34.000 --> 18:35.440]  I've got my spray bottle here.
[18:35.440 --> 18:37.460]  What I would do, I would spray this.
[18:37.460 --> 18:39.280]  I would have two or three spray bottles, honestly,
[18:39.280 --> 18:42.000]  or I've got another method that I do that,
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.200]  that's gonna remain one of my secrets here.
[18:44.200 --> 18:45.360]  I would have three spray bottles.
[18:45.360 --> 18:50.000]  I would mix up one solution that is 10% silver thiosulfate.
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  I would put, how much does this one hold?
[18:52.000 --> 18:53.080]  450.
[18:53.080 --> 18:56.000]  We'll say, just to make this easier,
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.260]  we'll say that I've got a thousand milliliter sprayer.
[18:59.260 --> 19:02.740]  I would put 900 mils of distilled water
[19:02.740 --> 19:05.900]  and 100 mils, I lost track of my math,
[19:05.900 --> 19:10.420]  100 mils of this non-diluted silver solution.
[19:10.420 --> 19:12.380]  So now it is a nine to one solution,
[19:12.380 --> 19:14.880]  nine parts water, one part silver.
[19:14.880 --> 19:16.700]  I would mix up a nine to one ratio.
[19:16.700 --> 19:18.920]  So I've got nine parts of distilled water,
[19:18.920 --> 19:20.600]  one part of our silver.
[19:20.600 --> 19:23.280]  I would also do another one that is an eight to two.
[19:23.280 --> 19:26.440]  So I've got eight parts water, two parts silver.
[19:26.440 --> 19:28.800]  Then I would do another one that is seven to three.
[19:29.340 --> 19:32.200]  So it's seven parts water, three parts the silver solution,
[19:32.200 --> 19:34.720]  basically 10, 20 and 30%.
[19:34.720 --> 19:36.800]  Then I would spray each plant.
[19:36.800 --> 19:39.400]  Let's talk about the schedule and intervals
[19:39.400 --> 19:41.520]  of when to spray these plants.
[19:41.520 --> 19:42.960]  I've got my golden goat plants.
[19:42.960 --> 19:46.880]  What I plan to do is I'm going to spray them seven days
[19:46.880 --> 19:48.720]  before I put them into flower.
[19:48.720 --> 19:51.040]  So today I'm recording on a Monday.
[19:51.040 --> 19:54.360]  I wanna put those plants into flower next Monday.
[19:54.360 --> 19:57.820]  So I will spray them today, give them a full week,
[19:57.820 --> 20:00.100]  put them into flower next Monday.
[20:00.100 --> 20:04.060]  When they go into flower that day, I will spray them again.
[20:04.060 --> 20:05.220]  They'll get sprayed again.
[20:05.220 --> 20:07.940]  So we're gonna spray them seven days before,
[20:07.940 --> 20:10.860]  and then we're gonna spray them again on day one.
[20:10.860 --> 20:12.940]  Now here's where we've got to pay attention
[20:12.940 --> 20:16.180]  because now I will spray them every three days
[20:16.180 --> 20:21.120]  until about day 21 or around 25 or 26,
[20:21.120 --> 20:23.660]  depending on what I see from that plant.
[20:23.660 --> 20:26.380]  Some plants are stubborn and they don't wanna reverse.
[20:26.380 --> 20:28.780]  If it's not reversing, keep spraying.
[20:28.780 --> 20:31.260]  Again, I'm using three different dilution rates
[20:31.260 --> 20:32.380]  so I can see some things.
[20:32.380 --> 20:34.340]  We're gonna talk about that in a moment.
[20:34.340 --> 20:35.860]  But spray every third day.
[20:35.860 --> 20:38.500]  You're gonna spray these plants about seven to 10 times
[20:38.500 --> 20:41.540]  total each plant over the course of their life.
[20:41.540 --> 20:44.100]  Now when you spray, spray that plant
[20:44.100 --> 20:45.780]  just about to the runoff point, right?
[20:45.780 --> 20:46.860]  When it starts running off,
[20:46.860 --> 20:48.900]  soak it to where it's just dripping around.
[20:48.900 --> 20:51.980]  Be careful because the silver solution can stain things.
[20:51.980 --> 20:54.580]  It will make things have a purple shine to it
[20:54.580 --> 20:55.880]  or a silver color behind it.
[20:56.380 --> 20:58.000]  I should have stuff on this table, honestly.
[20:58.000 --> 20:59.740]  So spray the plants.
[20:59.740 --> 21:02.080]  Don't just spray the foliage.
[21:02.080 --> 21:04.480]  Spray the stems, the stalks, the leaves,
[21:04.480 --> 21:05.760]  everything on that plant.
[21:05.760 --> 21:07.720]  Soak it, the entire plant,
[21:07.720 --> 21:09.400]  and then it will absorb more of the silver.
[21:09.400 --> 21:11.780]  What's happening here, brief science.
[21:11.780 --> 21:14.360]  I'm not a Scientologist or a Chemistry major.
[21:14.360 --> 21:17.160]  The silver disrupts the copper movement in the plant
[21:17.160 --> 21:19.240]  which triggers this plant.
[21:19.240 --> 21:20.600]  That's as far as we need to go.
[21:20.600 --> 21:22.580]  The silver disrupts the copper movement.
[21:22.580 --> 21:24.680]  We're trying to get the silver into the plant.
[21:24.680 --> 21:28.920]  The sodium thiosulfate works to penetrate the leaf surface
[21:28.920 --> 21:30.160]  and move that into the plant.
[21:30.160 --> 21:31.340]  That's why they're working together.
[21:31.340 --> 21:33.000]  That's why we mix this up.
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.200]  If you wanna know more, I've done full podcasts about that.
[21:35.200 --> 21:38.240]  I tried to stop myself from digging down that rabbit hole
[21:38.240 --> 21:39.600]  because we could go deep.
[21:39.600 --> 21:41.980]  So now let's talk about times to spray.
[21:41.980 --> 21:43.220]  I think that's where I was, right?
[21:43.220 --> 21:44.320]  Somebody put me back on track.
[21:44.320 --> 21:45.480]  I'm the only one here.
[21:45.480 --> 21:47.520]  So I'm gonna spray one week before flip.
[21:47.520 --> 21:49.980]  Oh, we're talking about dilutions and intervals, right?
[21:49.980 --> 21:52.540]  I really kind of got lost, but we'll fix this.
[21:52.540 --> 21:54.180]  Spray it one day, then spray it.
[21:54.840 --> 21:58.420]  Every three days, stop around day 21 or 24,
[21:58.420 --> 22:01.840]  maybe 27, spray it about seven to 10 times.
[22:01.840 --> 22:03.400]  What was I, where was I going?
[22:03.400 --> 22:05.180]  So we're gonna see things happen.
[22:05.180 --> 22:08.380]  Sometimes the heavier dilution
[22:08.380 --> 22:10.820]  will make the plants crinkle up and look angry.
[22:10.820 --> 22:13.000]  That's okay, we're not going for pretty plants.
[22:13.000 --> 22:14.400]  We're going for pollen here.
[22:14.400 --> 22:17.360]  But also sometimes too much silver
[22:17.360 --> 22:21.100]  can make the plants angry and they don't produce any pollen.
[22:21.100 --> 22:22.640]  Sometimes not enough silver
[22:22.640 --> 22:24.900]  will make them not produce any pollen.
[22:24.900 --> 22:27.420]  Sometimes just enough pollen, but not sprayed enough,
[22:27.420 --> 22:30.120]  or just enough silver, but not sprayed enough times
[22:30.120 --> 22:32.940]  or sprayed too many times will make it not make pollen.
[22:32.940 --> 22:34.940]  There's so many variables here.
[22:34.940 --> 22:37.840]  We've got to learn how much and how often with each plant.
[22:37.840 --> 22:40.260]  The only way to really do it is to do it.
[22:40.260 --> 22:41.600]  That's why I say spray three.
[22:41.600 --> 22:44.580]  If you can do five, spray five of the same plant.
[22:44.580 --> 22:46.940]  Spray them with that 70, 80, and 90,
[22:46.940 --> 22:49.620]  and then spray one of them more often than the other
[22:49.620 --> 22:51.060]  and less often than the other.
[22:51.060 --> 22:53.120]  Set up your own variables and take a lot of notes
[22:53.120 --> 22:56.480]  and see what works for the plants that you are working with.
[22:56.480 --> 22:57.960]  I've learned my plants.
[22:57.960 --> 22:59.640]  I've learned how to make the most amount of pollen
[22:59.640 --> 23:01.040]  that I can get from them.
[23:01.040 --> 23:02.720]  So it's just all trial and error,
[23:02.720 --> 23:04.520]  experience, experimenting.
[23:04.520 --> 23:05.740]  I'm pretty sure that's where my brain
[23:05.740 --> 23:07.020]  was going with that part.
[23:07.020 --> 23:09.020]  You'll see twisted, crooked, bent leaves,
[23:09.020 --> 23:10.680]  weird shit happening.
[23:10.680 --> 23:11.920]  Don't be afraid of that.
[23:11.920 --> 23:12.960]  You're looking for pollen.
[23:12.960 --> 23:15.880]  The plants are going to start making pollen sacks.
[23:15.880 --> 23:18.240]  You're going to see these female plants start doing shit
[23:18.240 --> 23:19.440]  you'd never seen them do before.
[23:19.440 --> 23:20.940]  Right where the new flower clusters
[23:20.940 --> 23:22.300]  are coming out at the top,
[23:22.300 --> 23:24.320]  you'll see these weird little round,
[23:24.320 --> 23:26.020]  it looks like they're growing a crown or a tip.
[23:26.020 --> 23:26.980]  It looks like a pine cone.
[23:26.980 --> 23:29.180]  It looks like some kind of fruit.
[23:29.180 --> 23:30.820]  It looks like a little baby corn
[23:30.820 --> 23:32.060]  or one of those little star fruits.
[23:32.060 --> 23:33.340]  I can't think of the fucking name of it.
[23:33.340 --> 23:34.680]  A really cool looking fruit.
[23:34.680 --> 23:35.520]  Starts looking like that.
[23:35.520 --> 23:37.180]  It's growing out of the top of it.
[23:38.180 --> 23:40.100]  That's the male parts forming.
[23:40.100 --> 23:43.540]  Around day 26, those will start opening.
[23:43.540 --> 23:46.780]  By day 32, 26-ish in that timeframe,
[23:46.780 --> 23:48.860]  they'll start making pollen.
[23:48.880 --> 23:50.480]  That's when you need to have the ladies ready
[23:50.480 --> 23:53.240]  or be ready to collect the pollen.
[23:53.240 --> 23:56.460]  My strategy, I generally start putting the females
[23:56.460 --> 23:58.160]  in the flowering room.
[23:58.160 --> 24:00.240]  So you're going to spray these plants one week.
[24:00.240 --> 24:01.780]  Or you're going to spray them on a Monday.
[24:01.780 --> 24:04.160]  Next Monday, put them in flower, 12-12.
[24:04.160 --> 24:05.520]  Spray them that day.
[24:05.520 --> 24:07.720]  Spray them every three days.
[24:07.720 --> 24:10.140]  Around day 26, they'll start giving you pollen.
[24:10.140 --> 24:11.640]  Maybe day 32.
[24:11.640 --> 24:13.160]  It's plant specific, dude.
[24:13.160 --> 24:15.400]  This is really the part you got to adjust.
[24:15.400 --> 24:17.640]  The intervals, the timing, and the plants,
[24:17.660 --> 24:18.780]  and the timing.
[24:18.780 --> 24:20.640]  It's all fucking timing, yeah.
[24:20.640 --> 24:22.780]  So get the females in there.
[24:22.780 --> 24:25.820]  When the male plants start showing you,
[24:25.820 --> 24:28.100]  or when the female pollen donors start showing you
[24:28.100 --> 24:29.620]  that it is making male parts,
[24:29.620 --> 24:31.980]  and you're sure that that bitch is reversing
[24:31.980 --> 24:34.260]  when you're positive that you've done the trick,
[24:34.260 --> 24:36.280]  drag those girls into the flower room.
[24:36.280 --> 24:38.980]  You should time it just about right at this point.
[24:38.980 --> 24:40.500]  Like I've talked about before,
[24:40.500 --> 24:44.780]  my platinum tangy plant that makes sun kiss and orange chasm,
[24:44.780 --> 24:46.600]  it wants pollen early.
[24:46.620 --> 24:49.100]  That plant that makes the strawberry starburst,
[24:49.100 --> 24:52.260]  the strawberry fields I use, it wants pollen much later.
[24:52.260 --> 24:54.700]  So you could probably, your first run,
[24:54.700 --> 24:57.020]  figure it out by dragging them all in there.
[24:57.020 --> 24:59.060]  The first time you see the male parts
[24:59.060 --> 25:01.940]  really significantly forming on your pollen donor,
[25:01.940 --> 25:03.460]  do your first cross that way.
[25:03.460 --> 25:06.340]  Then learn the timing from note taking,
[25:06.340 --> 25:09.020]  watching what happens, observation.
[25:09.020 --> 25:11.900]  Learn from there, then make adjustments on your next crop.
[25:11.900 --> 25:14.420]  Always keep in mind, this isn't the last time
[25:14.420 --> 25:15.580]  we're gonna do this project.
[25:15.580 --> 25:18.040]  Unless things go wrong, this isn't your last run.
[25:18.040 --> 25:19.480]  We're gonna do this again.
[25:19.480 --> 25:22.200]  Plan to make mistakes, plan to make adjustments.
[25:22.200 --> 25:24.700]  This is the first time you're riding this horse,
[25:24.700 --> 25:26.320]  you're gonna fall off of it.
[25:26.320 --> 25:28.400]  Don't be afraid to get back up on that horse,
[25:28.400 --> 25:30.920]  make some more fem seeds, and do that shit again.
[25:30.920 --> 25:32.500]  I'm going to review the notes.
[25:32.500 --> 25:33.760]  I got lost in one point,
[25:33.760 --> 25:35.180]  but I feel like I covered everything.
[25:35.180 --> 25:36.760]  I'm pretty sure that my point was
[25:36.760 --> 25:38.600]  talking about dilutions and when to spray.
[25:38.600 --> 25:42.280]  You're gonna have to learn how often, how hard to spray,
[25:42.280 --> 25:43.880]  just like learning somebody,
[25:43.900 --> 25:45.900]  you gotta go how often and how hard,
[25:45.900 --> 25:47.860]  you don't know until you figure it out.
[25:48.940 --> 25:52.020]  Spray them, flip them, spray them more, keep spraying.
[25:52.020 --> 25:54.740]  Drag the girls in there, keep spraying.
[25:54.740 --> 25:56.780]  You'll get pollen, stop spraying once you see pollen.
[25:56.780 --> 25:59.340]  You guys don't keep spraying the pollen, you'll ruin it.
[25:59.340 --> 26:01.620]  Put the females in there, let them fuck.
[26:01.620 --> 26:04.420]  Just let those guys pollinate the girls.
[26:04.420 --> 26:06.160]  When you're sure that they are done,
[26:06.160 --> 26:07.580]  when the girls are close to their point
[26:07.580 --> 26:09.220]  that they're not gonna receive any more pollen
[26:09.220 --> 26:11.500]  and you're sure the guy plants the pollen donors
[26:11.520 --> 26:13.840]  are done spitting out their pollen,
[26:13.840 --> 26:16.400]  cut off the tops and just smack them around
[26:16.400 --> 26:17.240]  on the female plants.
[26:17.240 --> 26:18.960]  You'll knock out more pollen into the room,
[26:18.960 --> 26:20.180]  into those plants.
[26:20.180 --> 26:22.080]  Then I do something weird, I hang the plants
[26:22.080 --> 26:24.560]  kind of from the lights or from the top of the canopy.
[26:24.560 --> 26:26.860]  As the pollen donor dries,
[26:26.860 --> 26:28.340]  more pollen will fall out of there.
[26:28.340 --> 26:30.480]  You'll get that last little bit of pollen.
[26:30.480 --> 26:31.680]  Get every drop that you can,
[26:31.680 --> 26:33.680]  because fem seeds, fem reversals
[26:33.680 --> 26:35.760]  don't make as much pollen as we would hope.
[26:35.760 --> 26:39.120]  That's part of why all the caveats, the catches,
[26:39.120 --> 26:42.020]  the tricks you heard are why fem seeds are more expensive.
[26:43.160 --> 26:45.340]  Learning the intervals, learning the timing,
[26:45.340 --> 26:47.700]  learning how much, learning the dilution rate,
[26:47.700 --> 26:49.440]  that all takes trial and error.
[26:49.440 --> 26:52.220]  That all takes note taking, skill, repetition.
[26:52.220 --> 26:54.180]  So you have to do everything the same every time
[26:54.180 --> 26:55.880]  and just adjust your solutions.
[26:55.880 --> 26:58.020]  So that's why fem seeds are expensive.
[26:58.020 --> 27:00.160]  Also, it doesn't make as much pollen.
[27:00.160 --> 27:02.880]  So I make about, when I do a five by five space,
[27:02.880 --> 27:05.200]  I know how many seeds I expect from regs.
[27:05.200 --> 27:07.760]  I expect about half, maybe three quarters of that
[27:07.760 --> 27:10.080]  from a feminized run, if I'm lucky.
[27:10.080 --> 27:12.400]  So that's why fems are a little bit more pricey.
[27:12.400 --> 27:14.920]  However, this SOP that I just gave you,
[27:14.920 --> 27:17.720]  honestly, I charge a lot of money for this SOP.
[27:17.720 --> 27:19.760]  I have charged a lot of money for this SOP.
[27:19.760 --> 27:21.680]  There are many details I did not give you
[27:21.680 --> 27:23.840]  that I'd included in the written standard operating
[27:23.840 --> 27:27.560]  procedure, but this was an expensive SOP in the past,
[27:27.560 --> 27:29.200]  and a standard operating procedure
[27:29.200 --> 27:31.860]  that I would charge money for in a consulting environment.
[27:31.860 --> 27:34.400]  People were, there are companies built on this SOP.
[27:34.400 --> 27:36.120]  You guys, iRegenetics uses this.
[27:36.120 --> 27:38.160]  This is the solution that I will use
[27:38.160 --> 27:40.920]  to make more fem golden goat, more lemon Jeffrey,
[27:40.920 --> 27:44.480]  more orange chasm, Chernobyl to reversed golden goat.
[27:44.480 --> 27:45.720]  What, I said that out loud on the show.
[27:45.720 --> 27:47.880]  That is gonna be in the room.
[27:47.880 --> 27:50.160]  So this is the solution I'll make.
[27:50.160 --> 27:51.760]  I'll show you how I'm gonna get into this bottle, actually.
[27:51.760 --> 27:53.720]  I'm gonna just dump this one into here.
[27:53.720 --> 27:54.720]  We'll set this aside.
[27:54.720 --> 27:56.520]  That is 100% mix right there.
[27:56.520 --> 27:58.520]  That's basically the same thing that's in here.
[27:58.520 --> 27:59.340]  Then I'm just gonna dump it.
[27:59.340 --> 28:00.420]  You gotta go quickly because of the way
[28:00.420 --> 28:01.980]  that physics and science and shit work.
[28:01.980 --> 28:02.960]  I'm gonna do it with a mic in front of me
[28:02.960 --> 28:05.660]  and see how much we spill, but booyah, go like that.
[28:06.180 --> 28:07.020]  Get that into there.
[28:07.020 --> 28:08.780]  Now I can dump this one into here easily.
[28:08.780 --> 28:11.340]  That's how it's gonna work, and then we'll do the dilutions.
[28:11.340 --> 28:12.500]  That's how it's gonna happen.
[28:12.500 --> 28:13.660]  I do my own ways of spraying.
[28:13.660 --> 28:14.480]  That's gonna happen.
[28:14.480 --> 28:16.060]  Now you guys, I'm excited to go spray
[28:16.060 --> 28:17.080]  some golden goat plants.
[28:17.080 --> 28:19.180]  I get to pull them bitches out of the veg area,
[28:19.180 --> 28:22.240]  get them to their safe space, spray them down, let them dry,
[28:22.240 --> 28:23.860]  give them a week, then a week from now,
[28:23.860 --> 28:25.380]  we'll put them into flower.
[28:25.380 --> 28:27.780]  Then about 25, 30 days from there,
[28:27.780 --> 28:29.900]  we'll drag the other girls into the room.
[28:29.900 --> 28:33.820]  Then about so many days from there, guess what?
[28:33.820 --> 28:38.140]  Lemon Jeffrey, Orange Gasm, Golden Goat,
[28:38.140 --> 28:41.500]  Red Pill and Blue Pill, Femini Seeds coming soon.
[28:41.500 --> 28:43.700]  There will also be Chernobyl to Golden Goat
[28:43.700 --> 28:45.020]  testers available.
[28:45.020 --> 28:45.940]  I'm excited about that.
[28:45.940 --> 28:47.580]  I'm sure you're gonna be excited about that.
[28:47.580 --> 28:49.500]  Right now, there are a lot of fem testers available.
[28:49.500 --> 28:51.080]  If you guys are interested in testing the fems,
[28:51.080 --> 28:55.180]  watch the fem or watch the tester episode number 590.
[28:55.180 --> 28:56.240]  Then join the Discord.
[28:56.240 --> 28:57.220]  Let me know.
[28:57.220 --> 28:58.940]  Send me an email and let me know
[28:58.940 --> 29:01.480]  that you've done all of the steps required to test,
[29:01.480 --> 29:02.320]  and we'll get you tested.
[29:02.320 --> 29:04.200]  I've got a lot of test seeds I wanna get out.
[29:04.200 --> 29:05.960]  All right, I'm excited to go spray those Golden Goats,
[29:05.960 --> 29:07.120]  get some fem seeds going.
[29:07.120 --> 29:09.600]  I think I've covered all the stuff I need to cover.
[29:09.600 --> 29:12.120]  That is Feminized Seeds Simplified.
[29:12.120 --> 29:14.120]  We're gonna get this water into this sprayer.
[29:14.120 --> 29:15.120]  We're gonna dilute it.
[29:15.120 --> 29:16.080]  We're gonna spray some plants.
[29:16.080 --> 29:17.360]  We're gonna make some fems.
[29:17.360 --> 29:19.520]  Ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes,
[29:19.520 --> 29:21.460]  friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[29:21.460 --> 29:24.840]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, fem seed makers,
[29:24.840 --> 29:26.840]  all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there,
[29:26.840 --> 29:28.400]  I truly do wanna thank you once again
[29:28.400 --> 29:29.760]  for listening to another episode
[29:29.760 --> 29:31.980]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[29:32.640 --> 29:33.740]  Like I said before, this was an SOP
[29:33.740 --> 29:36.100]  that I would normally charge a substantial amount
[29:36.100 --> 29:36.940]  of money for.
[29:36.940 --> 29:37.760]  I gave it to you for free here.
[29:37.760 --> 29:38.600]  I'm not begging.
[29:38.600 --> 29:40.120]  I'm not trying to tug at your heartstrings.
[29:40.120 --> 29:42.140]  However, there is a Patreon campaign.
[29:42.140 --> 29:44.300]  If you feel like this episode was valuable,
[29:44.300 --> 29:45.580]  if you feel like you learned something,
[29:45.580 --> 29:46.660]  if you laughed at something,
[29:46.660 --> 29:48.480]  or you'd like to throw me a couple of bucks
[29:48.480 --> 29:50.380]  just for my time, I would appreciate that.
[29:50.380 --> 29:54.020]  The easiest way to do so is to check out my Patreon campaign
[29:54.020 --> 29:57.200]  at patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[29:57.200 --> 29:58.460]  There is a link in the show notes,

[30:37.220 --> 30:39.020]  The OCD is making me want to rearrange this
[30:39.020 --> 30:41.300]  so that the end of the show looks nice on the screen.
[30:41.300 --> 30:43.060]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
[30:43.060 --> 30:43.900]  said that part.
[30:43.900 --> 30:44.940]  That is all I've got for you.
[30:44.940 --> 30:47.700]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[30:47.700 --> 30:50.460]  I want to give a big shout out to my buddy Rasta Bob.
[30:50.460 --> 30:51.300]  And until next time,
[30:51.300 --> 30:54.240]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
