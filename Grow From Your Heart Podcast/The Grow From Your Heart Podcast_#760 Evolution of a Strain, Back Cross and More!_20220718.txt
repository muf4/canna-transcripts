[00:23.250 --> 00:28.050]  This is episode 760 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:28.050 --> 00:31.770]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of grow questions before I get to that part
[00:31.770 --> 00:32.810]  of the show.
[00:32.810 --> 00:37.210]  Let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who continue to support the show

[01:41.870 --> 01:44.910]  That's right July 30th in Fort Collins Colorado.
[01:44.910 --> 01:47.430]  The Dude Grows crew is hosting the Growers Cup.
[01:47.430 --> 01:48.910]  I do invite you to join us.
[01:48.910 --> 01:51.410]  I will be there with Team Irie Genetics.
[01:51.410 --> 01:52.990]  Many other great breeders will be there.
[01:52.990 --> 01:56.910]  Many members of the Dude Grows crew and the Irie Army will be there hanging out.
[01:56.910 --> 01:59.030]  It won't be the same if you don't join us.
[01:59.030 --> 02:00.030]  So come to the party.
[02:00.030 --> 02:01.350]  I look forward to seeing you there.
[02:01.350 --> 02:05.390]  I do want to send a big thank you shout out to everybody who has been supporting Irie
[02:05.390 --> 02:06.390]  Direct.
[02:06.670 --> 02:10.310]  I recently added Irie Direct to the Irie Genetics website.
[02:10.310 --> 02:11.830]  There's been a great success.
[02:11.830 --> 02:13.270]  Thank you for all the positive feedback.
[02:13.270 --> 02:17.470]  I've been getting a lot of updates and feedback from great customer service feedback.
[02:17.470 --> 02:18.470]  Thank you.
[02:18.470 --> 02:19.470]  I do appreciate that.
[02:19.470 --> 02:22.650]  I do feel like that is most of the rambling that I had written down here for the start
[02:22.650 --> 02:23.650]  of the show.
[02:23.650 --> 02:27.830]  I want to talk about something that I've got called evolution of a strain and then we will
[02:27.830 --> 02:31.430]  work our way into some grow questions here.
[02:31.430 --> 02:36.070]  I was recently in a chat and somebody asked kind of how long it takes from the time I
[02:36.070 --> 02:38.550]  make a strain until it is released.
[02:38.550 --> 02:41.750]  They're like, man, didn't you make those like a long time ago and why are you just now putting
[02:41.750 --> 02:42.750]  them out?
[02:42.750 --> 02:46.110]  And then I thought that that would be a great thing to talk about here on the podcast.
[02:46.110 --> 02:48.950]  So we're going to talk about the evolution of a strain.
[02:48.950 --> 02:52.950]  When I make a new cross, when I get a male plant and a female plant and I do some pollen
[02:52.950 --> 02:58.350]  chucking and those plants make magic happen, how long from the time that cross is made
[02:58.350 --> 03:01.270]  until those seeds are actually released to the market?
[03:01.270 --> 03:06.070]  Let's talk about the process that takes, the steps that takes, just the way we do that.
[03:06.070 --> 03:07.070]  Here we go.
[03:07.070 --> 03:08.130]  We're going to jump into it.
[03:08.130 --> 03:13.170]  Let's just say that I'm in a grow or maybe somebody sends me a plant or I'm working in
[03:13.170 --> 03:18.030]  my garden and I realize that female plant right there would work beautifully with that
[03:18.030 --> 03:19.590]  male plant over there.
[03:19.590 --> 03:21.870]  Just something intuitively tells me that.
[03:21.870 --> 03:27.070]  Or maybe I'm smoking a plant and I go, this is really good, but it's missing this.
[03:27.070 --> 03:29.350]  And then I go, oh, well, this male plant's got that.
[03:29.350 --> 03:31.130]  Let's put those together.
[03:31.170 --> 03:35.170]  So there's an idea, there's an inception, there's a spawned idea in my brain.
[03:35.170 --> 03:36.370]  I've got to get the idea.
[03:36.370 --> 03:37.370]  So I've got the idea.
[03:37.370 --> 03:38.890]  Now I've got to cut some clones.
[03:38.890 --> 03:40.010]  I've got to clean out a room.
[03:40.010 --> 03:41.010]  I've got to get space.
[03:41.010 --> 03:43.010]  There could be at this time, who knows?
[03:43.010 --> 03:44.410]  I may have just put a room into flower.
[03:44.410 --> 03:48.930]  It could be 70 days before I could fucking do this project or I could get it going right away.
[03:48.930 --> 03:50.130]  So I've got the idea in my head.
[03:50.130 --> 03:52.170]  Now I've got to get the idea on paper.
[03:52.170 --> 03:53.410]  I'm going to write this down.
[03:53.410 --> 03:58.130]  I want to breed plant A to plant B and my goal is going to be to improve the part of
[03:58.130 --> 04:01.250]  this plant that sucks, kind of get this straight from this plant.
[04:01.250 --> 04:02.250]  This is what I'm hoping for.
[04:02.250 --> 04:03.490]  So I'm going to write that down.
[04:03.490 --> 04:09.570]  Then I will cut a bunch of clones, the appropriate clones to breed this project, female A and
[04:09.570 --> 04:11.850]  male A, and we're going to cut those plants.
[04:11.850 --> 04:13.130]  Then I'm going to veg them.
[04:13.130 --> 04:14.730]  Then we're going to put them in the flower room.
[04:14.730 --> 04:18.370]  Then of course there will be some pollen chuck and then six to eight weeks later we'll have
[04:18.370 --> 04:22.930]  seeds and it takes about a week for them to dry, pull the seeds out, separate them, get
[04:22.930 --> 04:24.550]  them all packaged up.
[04:24.550 --> 04:29.270]  From the time I start cutting those clones to the time I actually have usable, packageable
[04:29.270 --> 04:36.250]  seeds in my hands is probably somewhere around 16 to 20-ish weeks, depending on how large
[04:36.250 --> 04:40.550]  I want those plants to get, depending on how much space I've got, depending on which strains
[04:40.550 --> 04:41.550]  I'm working with.
[04:41.550 --> 04:46.430]  Some veg much more quickly, some don't veg as rapidly, so they've got to go another week,
[04:46.430 --> 04:51.590]  but it could be up to 20 weeks from the time I cut the clones till I have the first seeds
[04:51.590 --> 04:54.250]  in my hand ready to put into packages.
[04:54.250 --> 04:56.730]  Then from there there's a lot of work to do.
[04:56.730 --> 04:57.890]  Let's just say I got the idea.
[04:57.890 --> 04:59.130]  I wrote down the goal.
[04:59.130 --> 05:01.730]  I put the male plant and the female plant in the room at the right time.
[05:01.730 --> 05:03.370]  They did their magic.
[05:03.370 --> 05:05.370]  We let the seeds harden up.
[05:05.370 --> 05:06.370]  The seeds have been harvested.
[05:06.370 --> 05:08.590]  They get, the plants get harvested.
[05:08.590 --> 05:09.590]  They get cut down.
[05:09.590 --> 05:11.970]  The plants dry, pull the seeds out, separate them.
[05:11.970 --> 05:12.970]  It's been 20 weeks.
[05:12.970 --> 05:14.770]  Now let's talk about the other steps that it takes.
[05:14.770 --> 05:19.230]  This is where the work really begins before I can start releasing this product.
[05:19.230 --> 05:21.230]  We've put 20 weeks into the grow.
[05:21.230 --> 05:25.070]  Now I've got to harvest it, package it up, and do some testing.
[05:25.070 --> 05:27.590]  This is when I start growing the seeds.
[05:27.590 --> 05:30.350]  It's been 20 weeks already and I don't even know what I've made yet.
[05:30.350 --> 05:31.350]  I'm going to grow these seeds.
[05:31.350 --> 05:33.190]  I'm going to veg them out for just a couple of weeks.
[05:33.190 --> 05:35.990]  They're going to be really little on my first run.
[05:35.990 --> 05:37.270]  My tester plants are tiny.
[05:37.270 --> 05:39.030]  They go in a one gallon pot.
[05:39.030 --> 05:42.950]  They veg till they're about eight or nine inches tall, and then I flip them.
[05:42.950 --> 05:45.830]  Then I take a lot of pictures and a lot of notes.
[05:45.830 --> 05:48.150]  The first step is to make the seeds.
[05:48.150 --> 05:50.910]  We already established that's about a 20 week process.
[05:51.590 --> 05:52.590]  Then I'm going to grow them.
[05:52.590 --> 05:53.590]  I'm going to veg for two weeks.
[05:53.590 --> 05:55.390]  Then I'm going to flower for 10 weeks.
[05:55.390 --> 05:59.550]  We're already up to approximately a 30 week process and all I've done is test the seeds
[05:59.550 --> 06:00.550]  myself.
[06:00.550 --> 06:02.390]  Nobody else has even grown these yet.
[06:02.390 --> 06:07.910]  Once I grow them, if I approve, then I package up testers and I go recruiting the test team
[06:07.910 --> 06:10.310]  to get some seeds going for me.
[06:10.310 --> 06:12.990]  They're going to take a week or two to get the seeds.
[06:12.990 --> 06:15.270]  Then they're going to take two to four weeks to veg those.
[06:15.270 --> 06:16.910]  Some guys go even longer.
[06:16.910 --> 06:18.790]  We're looking at 40 weeks already.
[06:18.790 --> 06:21.110]  Then they've got nine to 10 more weeks of flowering.
[06:21.110 --> 06:22.110]  That's 50 weeks.
[06:22.110 --> 06:23.790]  You guys, we're at nearly a year.
[06:23.790 --> 06:26.350]  Two more weeks is a full year.
[06:26.350 --> 06:30.430]  That is several weeks of work before we even really get to put a seed out to market.
[06:30.430 --> 06:31.710]  I've got to make it.
[06:31.710 --> 06:32.870]  Then I've got to test it.
[06:32.870 --> 06:34.750]  I've got to send it out to the testers.
[06:34.750 --> 06:39.990]  Now, oftentimes when I see that the testers are having success with these seeds, I will
[06:39.990 --> 06:41.910]  add them as freebies to orders.
[06:41.910 --> 06:47.070]  If you're getting seeds off of iRedirect, then you will get some brand new shit as freebies.
[06:47.070 --> 06:48.550]  Those are testers.
[06:49.310 --> 06:52.670]  Instead of just putting them out as test seeds, I also give them away.
[06:52.670 --> 06:55.710]  They're labeled on the package that they're testers, that I don't know what they're going
[06:55.710 --> 06:56.710]  to do yet.
[06:56.710 --> 06:59.430]  I make it clear, this is a freebie tester, but here you go.
[06:59.430 --> 07:00.770]  Have fun with it.
[07:00.770 --> 07:04.470]  What then happens after I give those testers away, a lot of those people will grow those
[07:04.470 --> 07:08.470]  before they even grow the seeds they paid for because they got some brand new exciting
[07:08.470 --> 07:10.130]  shit they weren't expecting.
[07:10.130 --> 07:11.310]  They're going to grow that.
[07:11.310 --> 07:14.790]  Then I get even more feedback because now I've got the feedback I got from the crop.
[07:14.790 --> 07:15.790]  I grew.
[07:15.790 --> 07:17.230]  I get feedback from my testers.
[07:17.230 --> 07:20.950]  Now I get feedback from the people that are growing it as freebies.
[07:20.950 --> 07:24.110]  I test it, the group tests it, then it goes out as freebies.
[07:24.110 --> 07:25.630]  Now I'm getting a bunch of photos.
[07:25.630 --> 07:29.270]  I'm getting a bunch of data and a bunch of feedback and we know what we've really got.
[07:29.270 --> 07:32.150]  At this point, if it's gotten this far, I know it's going to make it.
[07:32.150 --> 07:34.550]  It won't get this far if it's not going to make it.
[07:34.550 --> 07:37.550]  If I didn't like it, if the testers didn't approve of it, if there were problems, it
[07:37.550 --> 07:38.550]  just got scrapped.
[07:38.550 --> 07:39.970]  It got put on the back burner.
[07:39.970 --> 07:40.970]  It got forgotten about.
[07:40.970 --> 07:44.510]  Those seeds are probably flushed down the toilet or in a compost bin or fed to the birds.
[07:44.670 --> 07:49.830]  So once I see enough people growing and I've got pictures and photos and data, then I can
[07:49.830 --> 07:50.830]  start hyping it up.
[07:50.830 --> 07:53.870]  I know it's going to come out for an official release.
[07:53.870 --> 07:59.030]  What I may do at this point is do kind of a pre-release on my website or another website.
[07:59.030 --> 08:04.590]  A lot of times I will pick one vendor and I will do an exclusive drop with that one
[08:04.590 --> 08:05.590]  vendor.
[08:05.590 --> 08:09.510]  A lot of times it is seeds here now because that's my preferred exclusive vendor, but
[08:09.510 --> 08:14.270]  sometimes I will rotate it around to where vendor A is going to get these packs on this
[08:14.310 --> 08:17.390]  day and then vendor B is going to get these packs on this day.
[08:17.390 --> 08:19.510]  That way I don't overload one vendor.
[08:19.510 --> 08:20.630]  Everybody gets to play.
[08:20.630 --> 08:21.950]  Somebody gets to, everybody gets to eat.
[08:21.950 --> 08:22.950]  The money gets spread around.
[08:22.950 --> 08:24.270]  The business gets moved around.
[08:24.270 --> 08:28.030]  I like to support all of the vendors because they do support me and they support you, the
[08:28.030 --> 08:29.390]  consumer.
[08:29.390 --> 08:35.270]  So at this point we have gone from me making seeds, me testing seeds, the test crew testing
[08:35.270 --> 08:37.550]  out seeds, the freebies going out.
[08:37.550 --> 08:41.670]  Now they are going to a pre-drop at one vendor or on my website.
[08:41.670 --> 08:43.270]  We'll just put out a few of them.
[08:43.270 --> 08:44.270]  We'll let them go.
[08:44.270 --> 08:47.590]  We'll see what the excitement is like, what the hype is like, get a count of how many
[08:47.590 --> 08:49.110]  sell and how quickly.
[08:49.110 --> 08:53.190]  Then that lets me prepare for the official drop where I will call up all the vendors
[08:53.190 --> 08:54.470]  and say, hey, I got this many packs.
[08:54.470 --> 08:55.470]  How many do you want?
[08:55.470 --> 08:56.470]  They'll claim their packs.
[08:56.470 --> 09:00.470]  I'll send it out to them and we will all agree that at five o'clock on this day they are
[09:00.470 --> 09:01.470]  going on sale.
[09:01.470 --> 09:04.670]  We'll all drop them on our websites all at the same time.
[09:04.670 --> 09:09.070]  Sometimes that process is over one full year.
[09:09.070 --> 09:13.110]  Many of the seeds that you guys see me putting out on the websites right now, the seeds that
[09:13.150 --> 09:18.710]  are dropping on iRedirect were made a solid year, maybe 18 months ago.
[09:18.710 --> 09:23.270]  You'll notice the Inspector Royale, it is on the website, on the iRedirect website right
[09:23.270 --> 09:24.270]  now.
[09:24.270 --> 09:26.870]  It will make a huge debut at the DGC Growers Cup.
[09:26.870 --> 09:28.430]  I will have plenty there.
[09:28.430 --> 09:31.870]  That one was made in a greenhouse approximately a year ago.
[09:31.870 --> 09:33.590]  Those seeds were made.
[09:33.590 --> 09:39.230]  We put plants outdoors already in that greenhouse again and I am just now dropping those seeds.
[09:39.270 --> 09:44.150]  That is what goes into testing and ensuring that a seed is a quality product.
[09:44.150 --> 09:46.430]  I don't just make some seeds and throw them out there.
[09:46.430 --> 09:49.070]  I've got these seeds sitting around being tested.
[09:49.070 --> 09:50.070]  They're in storage.
[09:50.070 --> 09:51.070]  They're in a jar.
[09:51.070 --> 09:52.070]  They're in a vault.
[09:52.070 --> 09:55.350]  They're being saved and preserved for up to a year before you guys get to get them because
[09:55.350 --> 09:57.990]  I want to make sure it is a quality product.
[09:57.990 --> 10:02.310]  Oftentimes I'll make a small batch of these seeds and we'll test those.
[10:02.310 --> 10:06.550]  Once I realize if it's a real big hit, then I'll go back and make a lot more.
[10:06.550 --> 10:07.710]  Sometimes that's really time consuming.
[10:07.710 --> 10:11.590]  I try to bang it out on the first run so we can keep moving forward, remake stuff that
[10:11.590 --> 10:15.030]  really sells well and move past the shit that doesn't.
[10:15.030 --> 10:17.870]  That is the inception of a seed.
[10:17.870 --> 10:21.790]  Sometimes from the time I think about it to the time you get your first batch of seeds
[10:21.790 --> 10:24.150]  is up to a solid year.
[10:24.150 --> 10:25.390]  Be patient with me.
[10:25.390 --> 10:26.390]  Be understanding.
[10:26.390 --> 10:27.590]  There's a lot of work to be done.
[10:27.590 --> 10:32.510]  Also, as a consumer, as a buyer, as a customer, as a grower, you should be excited that I'm
[10:32.510 --> 10:37.310]  spending a solid year doing research and development on one package of seeds so that you don't
[10:37.310 --> 10:39.510]  get intersex plants, dud plants.
[10:39.510 --> 10:42.270]  I really put a lot of care into this is what I'm trying to say.
[10:42.270 --> 10:43.270]  All right.
[10:43.270 --> 10:45.870]  That's what I wanted to talk about the inception and evolution of a strain.
[10:45.870 --> 10:48.110]  Oh, there's one more part.
[10:48.110 --> 10:50.790]  Before I will release a strain, and this was really frustrating.
[10:50.790 --> 10:52.710]  Shout out to my buddy Fiscal.
[10:52.710 --> 10:54.390]  Fiscal wanted to buy some seeds off of me.
[10:54.390 --> 10:55.550]  He's like, you've got that cross?
[10:55.550 --> 10:57.230]  I was like, yeah, but I got a lot of them.
[10:57.230 --> 10:58.230]  He's like, sell it to me.
[10:58.230 --> 11:01.590]  I said, I can't sell it until I've got a name for it.
[11:01.590 --> 11:03.150]  He was throwing out names every day.
[11:03.150 --> 11:04.750]  I would get a list of names.
[11:04.750 --> 11:06.910]  Eventually that one did become fist bump.
[11:06.910 --> 11:07.910]  That's available.
[11:07.910 --> 11:09.510]  Check out the fist bump on iRi Direct.
[11:09.510 --> 11:10.510]  All right.
[11:10.510 --> 11:12.630]  That is all I've got for the evolution of a strain.
[11:12.630 --> 11:15.710]  Let's work our way into these emails that I was talking about.
[11:15.710 --> 11:18.010]  I've got a great email right here in front of me.
[11:18.010 --> 11:23.950]  This one comes from my friend, Pete Pan 007, and it goes a little bit like this.
[11:23.950 --> 11:26.150]  It says, question maybe for the podcast.
[11:26.150 --> 11:27.630]  This is a good one, bro.
[11:27.630 --> 11:31.430]  It says a lot of people are going on vacation right now and harvest time always seems to
[11:31.430 --> 11:35.350]  fall on one week you leave for vacay.
[11:35.350 --> 11:39.070]  And then he says the thing that I was going to say right after that, I need to plan better.
[11:39.070 --> 11:41.630]  Yes, you plan to the grow and the vacation.
[11:41.630 --> 11:43.110]  I bet your wife planned the vacation.
[11:43.110 --> 11:46.750]  I know how that shit goes, but you do need to plan better.
[11:46.750 --> 11:50.310]  Everyone's got a calendar and a schedule and we got Alexa and Siri to tell us when we fuck
[11:50.310 --> 11:52.590]  up, but planning is key right there.
[11:52.590 --> 11:57.230]  But it says, my question is, would you harvest when things are looking super close at about
[11:57.230 --> 12:01.030]  a week nine or would you wait and cut them down when you get home?
[12:01.030 --> 12:02.030]  Thank you, bro.
[12:02.030 --> 12:04.150]  I love your straightforward info you give to us.
[12:04.150 --> 12:08.470]  I am Pete Pan 007 on the gram and your awesome discord.
[12:08.470 --> 12:09.470]  And you can say my name.
[12:09.470 --> 12:14.630]  You guys go follow Pete Pan 007 on the gram and also join the discord server.
[12:14.630 --> 12:15.670]  Check out the discord server.
[12:15.670 --> 12:20.390]  There will be a link in the show notes and in the video description to get to the discord.
[12:20.390 --> 12:21.390]  Let's talk about this.
[12:21.390 --> 12:23.070]  It's summertime.
[12:23.070 --> 12:24.270]  People are going on vacation.
[12:24.270 --> 12:25.270]  People are traveling around.
[12:25.270 --> 12:26.270]  I'm guilty.
[12:26.270 --> 12:27.270]  I've been all over the place.
[12:27.270 --> 12:31.070]  I haven't left Colorado, but I've been to every fricking border of Colorado in the past
[12:31.070 --> 12:32.070]  couple of weeks here.
[12:32.070 --> 12:33.070]  It's been a no complaints.
[12:33.070 --> 12:34.910]  It's been great, but it's time consuming.
[12:34.910 --> 12:36.230]  It's exhausting.
[12:36.230 --> 12:40.150]  And the garden does almost suffer at times because I'll catch myself driving home going,
[12:40.150 --> 12:41.270]  fuck, I hope the plants are okay.
[12:41.270 --> 12:42.270]  I hope the plants are okay.
[12:42.270 --> 12:44.430]  And they are, but it's a little nerve wracking.
[12:44.430 --> 12:49.670]  So if you're going to go on vacation, it will be less nerve wracking if you cut before you
[12:49.670 --> 12:54.710]  go, but the plants will do you better if you wait until you get back.
[12:54.710 --> 12:56.750]  Don't cut them until you get back.
[12:56.750 --> 13:00.550]  When in doubt, always just give them that extra week, 10 days, let them grow longer.
[13:00.550 --> 13:01.550]  You're going to have better buds.
[13:01.550 --> 13:06.630]  If you go longer, you'll have more bud, better bud, more dense bud, more flavor, more potent,
[13:06.630 --> 13:07.830]  more potency.
[13:07.830 --> 13:08.830]  So just wait.
[13:08.830 --> 13:10.350]  I would cut them down after the vacation.
[13:10.350 --> 13:11.350]  Go have a good time.
[13:11.350 --> 13:12.350]  Go enjoy your trip.
[13:12.350 --> 13:14.710]  Go enjoy the time with the family or whatever you're doing.
[13:14.710 --> 13:18.070]  And then when you get back, you've got something really cool to look forward to.
[13:18.070 --> 13:21.770]  You don't want to cut it down right before you leave anyway, because then it's just going
[13:21.770 --> 13:22.910]  to hang there your whole trip.
[13:22.910 --> 13:23.910]  It may get too dry.
[13:23.910 --> 13:25.430]  It may get too crispy.
[13:25.430 --> 13:27.230]  You may need to do some adjustments.
[13:27.230 --> 13:28.230]  You can't burp it.
[13:28.230 --> 13:29.230]  You can't put it in jars.
[13:29.230 --> 13:31.390]  I would wait until I get back.
[13:31.390 --> 13:35.070]  As for watering while you're gone, I would just soak them real hard right before you
[13:35.070 --> 13:38.990]  go unless you've got a buddy or a grow helper, which I really, I don't like that most of
[13:38.990 --> 13:39.990]  the time.
[13:39.990 --> 13:43.990]  They always end up, I hear more stories about the grow helper fucking up than helping all
[13:43.990 --> 13:49.030]  the time, but just water them real hard before you go and then just let them ride it out
[13:49.030 --> 13:53.010]  until you come back and maybe you'll have some buds that are already drying on the stick
[13:53.010 --> 13:55.230]  for you getting a little pre-harvest going.
[13:55.230 --> 13:58.710]  But my advice is always let them go a little bit longer.
[13:58.710 --> 14:02.470]  Don't do them too early ever unless that is absolutely what you got to do.
[14:02.470 --> 14:04.230]  I hope you learned your lesson, bro.
[14:04.230 --> 14:07.470]  Plan ahead next time so you're not on vacation during the harvest.
[14:07.470 --> 14:08.470]  All right.
[14:08.470 --> 14:09.470]  Thank you for the great message.
[14:09.470 --> 14:10.470]  All right.
[14:10.470 --> 14:12.590]  The next question here comes from my buddy Alabama Man.
[14:12.590 --> 14:14.310]  Big shout out to my buddy Alabama Man.
[14:14.310 --> 14:15.830]  Thank you for all of the support.
[14:15.830 --> 14:16.830]  This is a good question.
[14:16.830 --> 14:18.830]  It says, I hope all is well, sir.
[14:18.830 --> 14:19.870]  Bro, things are great.
[14:19.870 --> 14:20.870]  It's summertime.
[14:20.870 --> 14:21.870]  I'm healthy.
[14:21.870 --> 14:22.870]  Business is booming.
[14:22.870 --> 14:23.870]  Relationships are good.
[14:23.870 --> 14:25.550]  We've been having a good time.
[14:25.550 --> 14:30.150]  The world hasn't exploded yet, so I guess things are going quite well.
[14:30.150 --> 14:35.670]  The question says, have you ever initiated a back cross using pollen from the original
[14:35.670 --> 14:37.750]  male donor?
[14:37.750 --> 14:40.870]  The original male donor using pollen initiated a back cross.
[14:40.870 --> 14:46.150]  Well, if I had the original male, I probably wouldn't need to make a back cross.
[14:46.150 --> 14:50.750]  The reason I make a back cross generally is because the male plant is not present and
[14:50.750 --> 14:55.350]  I want to make seeds of a female plant, something we would call a clone only.
[14:55.350 --> 15:00.590]  So generally, I wouldn't do that because I don't have the original male pollen donor.
[15:00.590 --> 15:05.810]  My main goal when I'm making a back cross is to replicate a female clone.
[15:05.810 --> 15:08.850]  So let's talk about how I make a back cross since we're here.
[15:08.850 --> 15:13.590]  What I would do, let's just say we want to make golden goat back cross seeds.
[15:13.590 --> 15:15.230]  People want golden goat regular seeds.
[15:15.230 --> 15:16.230]  They don't want the fems.
[15:16.230 --> 15:17.530]  They want golden goat.
[15:17.530 --> 15:21.370]  Golden goat's not available because there's no male of the golden goat available.
[15:21.370 --> 15:24.090]  So what I did was I took daybreaker.
[15:24.090 --> 15:27.290]  Daybreaker is a great strain, but it is completely different than golden goat.
[15:27.290 --> 15:29.130]  It is the opposite in every way.
[15:29.130 --> 15:30.730]  It's got big fat leaves.
[15:30.730 --> 15:33.350]  It grows kind of with a stretchier pattern.
[15:33.350 --> 15:35.730]  It's a little shorter and squatty, but stretchy at the same time.
[15:35.730 --> 15:37.570]  If you grow cush, you know what I mean.
[15:37.570 --> 15:39.490]  But it is totally different than the golden goat.
[15:39.490 --> 15:44.090]  Golden goat's got the big skinny sativa leaves, really tight internode spacing.
[15:44.090 --> 15:49.490]  So my goal here, I took a male daybreaker plant and I pollinated a female golden goat.
[15:49.490 --> 15:53.390]  Now when I found the plants that came from there, my goal was to replicate golden goat.
[15:53.390 --> 15:58.290]  So anything that looked like daybreaker and that progeny got immediately eliminated.
[15:58.290 --> 16:00.010]  That was harder to say than it looked.
[16:00.010 --> 16:03.770]  The plants that looked like daybreaker got culled from the population right away.
[16:03.770 --> 16:07.930]  I only needed plants that looked like golden goat and I only needed a boy that looked like
[16:07.930 --> 16:08.930]  golden goat.
[16:08.930 --> 16:12.610]  So females got pulled right away and plants that looked like daybreaker got pulled right
[16:12.610 --> 16:13.610]  away.
[16:13.610 --> 16:16.850]  Eventually, I narrowed it down to a male plant.
[16:16.850 --> 16:19.530]  They looked just like the golden goat.
[16:19.530 --> 16:20.790]  He grew the same way.
[16:20.790 --> 16:22.950]  He had the same leaf serrations.
[16:22.950 --> 16:24.970]  He reacted the same way to stress.
[16:24.970 --> 16:27.670]  It looked just like the original female golden goat.
[16:27.670 --> 16:31.010]  It looked so close to the original golden goat that when I took leaves off and held
[16:31.010 --> 16:33.590]  it up to the other leaves, they matched perfectly.
[16:33.590 --> 16:35.890]  They had the same serrations, same ripple.
[16:35.890 --> 16:37.030]  It was a perfect match.
[16:37.030 --> 16:42.970]  So I took the pollen from my golden goat to daybreaker cross and it's a male that looks
[16:42.970 --> 16:44.030]  just like golden goat.
[16:44.030 --> 16:48.090]  I took that pollen and put it on to the golden goat.
[16:48.090 --> 16:51.270]  Now my goal here is to wash out the traits from that daybreaker.
[16:51.270 --> 16:55.310]  Now we've got golden goat in here twice, daybreaker in here once.
[16:55.310 --> 16:58.950]  Mathematically, genetically, this should be mostly golden goat.
[16:58.950 --> 17:03.310]  The way that I saw it in my prediction, I thought that I picked such a close golden
[17:03.310 --> 17:09.250]  goat that probably 80 to 90% of the phenotypes should look just like golden goat.
[17:09.250 --> 17:11.950]  After we ran a bunch of the seeds, you guys have ran a bunch of them.
[17:11.950 --> 17:17.190]  I'm going to say 75% of them look just like the original golden goat.
[17:17.190 --> 17:20.230]  So my next step would be to back cross it again.
[17:20.230 --> 17:23.810]  In that process, what I would do is I would take the original golden goat clone, which
[17:23.810 --> 17:29.230]  is a female, and I would find some of those back cross the first filial generation of
[17:29.230 --> 17:30.230]  the back cross.
[17:30.230 --> 17:31.430]  That's a back cross one.
[17:31.430 --> 17:35.790]  I would find a male out of there that looked just like golden goat again and put that pollen
[17:35.790 --> 17:41.270]  back on the original golden goat clone again, making a back cross number two.
[17:41.270 --> 17:46.710]  Now the seeds that come out of there should, in theory, if my selection was done correctly,
[17:46.710 --> 17:53.270]  those should be approximately 80% golden goat dominant phenotypes, maybe 82, 84%.
[17:53.270 --> 17:57.390]  The method here is to keep finding golden goat looking males and putting that pollen
[17:57.390 --> 18:03.070]  back onto the original golden goat to solidify that golden goat trait and in an essence,
[18:03.070 --> 18:05.190]  wash out all of the traits of the daybreaker.
[18:05.190 --> 18:06.670]  I don't want the daybreaker in there.
[18:06.670 --> 18:12.110]  I only used it for that pollen for that one inception, for that one round to create some
[18:12.110 --> 18:13.110]  seeds.
[18:13.110 --> 18:14.950]  Now my whole goal is to wash that out.
[18:14.950 --> 18:21.230]  So I don't think I would use the original male pollen unless my goal is to lock in that
[18:21.230 --> 18:27.550]  male trait, but that doesn't seem necessary because I'm working with a female clone only.
[18:27.550 --> 18:31.990]  Now let's hypothetically say that a friend of mine got a seed of a plant that I've been
[18:31.990 --> 18:34.790]  wanting forever, but it turned out to be a male.
[18:34.790 --> 18:40.770]  I could, in theory, take that male plant, pollinate a female, create seeds, find a female
[18:40.770 --> 18:45.010]  that looks like the male that I want, use that original male to put on another female
[18:45.010 --> 18:50.230]  and keep going, but I don't know what I'm looking for because I don't have the original
[18:50.230 --> 18:51.230]  female.
[18:51.230 --> 18:52.350]  So it's kind of a wild goose chase there.
[18:52.350 --> 18:56.990]  I don't know exactly what my goal is unless I can identify the female that I'm looking
[18:56.990 --> 18:57.990]  for.
[18:57.990 --> 19:01.430]  I need to know what it grows like, what it looks like, what it smells like.
[19:01.430 --> 19:07.350]  So in most cases, no, I would not initiate a back cross using pollen from the original
[19:07.350 --> 19:08.830]  male pollen donor.
[19:08.830 --> 19:12.510]  If I had the original male, then I wouldn't need the back cross.
[19:12.510 --> 19:13.510]  That is going backwards.
[19:13.510 --> 19:17.090]  My whole goal is to wash out the pollen from that original male.
[19:17.090 --> 19:18.390]  So I think that answers the question.
[19:18.390 --> 19:20.190]  I hope I answered the question there.
[19:20.190 --> 19:22.790]  If that did spark any more questions, please do follow up.
[19:22.790 --> 19:24.150]  I would love to hear from you.
[19:24.150 --> 19:29.390]  The email address, of course, is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[19:29.390 --> 19:30.390]  Let's keep moving.
[19:30.390 --> 19:32.790]  I do have a big stack of emails here right in front of me.
[19:32.790 --> 19:34.350]  This one comes from our friend.
[19:34.350 --> 19:35.350]  Do they want their name said?
[19:35.350 --> 19:37.510]  It does not say if they want their name said.
[19:37.510 --> 19:39.110]  This one goes a little bit like this.
[19:39.110 --> 19:43.670]  It says, yo, Rasta Jeff, I'm asking about that 10 days in flowering on the light change
[19:43.670 --> 19:45.190]  to 18-6.
[19:45.190 --> 19:47.330]  So let me recap a little bit right there.
[19:47.330 --> 19:51.570]  For about the past year, I've been talking about a method where I turn my lights to 18
[19:51.570 --> 19:57.690]  hours on and 6 hours off for the last 10 to 14 days of flowering.
[19:57.690 --> 19:59.690]  Many people think that flushing is a myth.
[19:59.690 --> 20:05.430]  If you do or don't flush, when you start flushing, just turn those lights back on to 18-6.
[20:05.430 --> 20:08.210]  In my experience, your buds will get beefier.
[20:08.210 --> 20:09.210]  They'll get more dense.
[20:09.210 --> 20:10.210]  They'll get fatter.
[20:10.210 --> 20:12.890]  They may even finish up a few days early.
[20:12.890 --> 20:15.490]  That extra light really makes the plants go faster.
[20:15.490 --> 20:17.850]  I really think it does a lot of great things.
[20:17.850 --> 20:23.570]  So our friend here is trying the 18-6 method and they do ask, how much PPFD should I run?
[20:23.570 --> 20:26.970]  I'm currently at about a thousand with 13-11.
[20:26.970 --> 20:29.410]  So that's a great switch from 13-11 to 18-6.
[20:29.410 --> 20:31.130]  That'll be a great cycle.
[20:31.130 --> 20:34.050]  But I would not recommend changing the PPFD.
[20:34.050 --> 20:36.770]  All I do is change the amount of hours.
[20:36.770 --> 20:40.610]  Changing the PPFD will be too many variables in my opinion.
[20:40.610 --> 20:41.610]  I wouldn't go up.
[20:41.610 --> 20:42.610]  I wouldn't go down.
[20:42.610 --> 20:44.090]  I would just change the amount of hours.
[20:44.090 --> 20:46.610]  You're going to get more light without stressing them.
[20:46.610 --> 20:48.570]  If you change it to more light, you may burn them.
[20:48.570 --> 20:52.010]  If you change it to less light, it's kind of pointless to increase the amount of hours.
[20:52.010 --> 20:53.890]  So I don't change anything.
[20:53.890 --> 20:57.010]  I go with the exact same amount of light, the same number of lights.
[20:57.010 --> 21:00.970]  All I do is increase the amount of hours which the plants are given.
[21:00.970 --> 21:03.490]  Somebody else also asked me if I do a ramp up.
[21:03.490 --> 21:08.650]  If I do like going from 12-12, do I do 13 hours one day and then 14 the next?
[21:08.650 --> 21:09.650]  No.
[21:09.650 --> 21:13.050]  I go straight from 12-12 to 18 on and 6 off.
[21:13.050 --> 21:15.170]  Sometimes I'll even do 19 and 5.
[21:15.170 --> 21:16.730]  That's a new thing I'm fucking with.
[21:16.730 --> 21:17.730]  Seems to be working.
[21:17.730 --> 21:19.850]  The plants do seem to enjoy that.
[21:19.850 --> 21:21.970]  I've got one more question for this episode.
[21:21.970 --> 21:25.370]  This one comes from another person who would like to remain anonymous.
[21:25.370 --> 21:30.810]  It says, what is the reason some plants lose their aroma at the end of flower?
[21:30.810 --> 21:33.370]  There are a lot of things that could be causing this.
[21:33.370 --> 21:34.810]  This could be a nutrient issue.
[21:34.810 --> 21:37.090]  This could be a VPD issue.
[21:37.090 --> 21:39.010]  This could be a light intensity issue.
[21:39.010 --> 21:42.210]  Are your lights too close and too hot to the plant?
[21:42.210 --> 21:45.250]  The number one thing that breaks down terpenes is heat.
[21:45.250 --> 21:48.490]  So if you've got too much heat in the room, the terps are getting destroyed.
[21:48.490 --> 21:50.490]  So the first thing I would do is check on the heat.
[21:50.490 --> 21:51.610]  Check the VPD.
[21:51.610 --> 21:53.170]  How hot is it in that room?
[21:53.170 --> 21:56.410]  Maybe get it a little bit cooler toward the end of harvest.
[21:56.410 --> 22:00.570]  Cold temperatures later in the grow will give you better flavors, aromas, and also will
[22:00.570 --> 22:05.610]  bring out some really cool colors and may really help with the density of your buds.
[22:05.610 --> 22:07.930]  So this could be a feed issue.
[22:07.930 --> 22:10.470]  This could be a VPD issue.
[22:10.470 --> 22:12.170]  This could be a lighting issue.
[22:12.170 --> 22:14.050]  This also could be a genetics issue.
[22:14.050 --> 22:15.470]  Are you not cutting down on time?
[22:15.470 --> 22:17.210]  Are you letting them go too long?
[22:17.210 --> 22:20.290]  Are they simply going into senescence and just giving up?
[22:20.290 --> 22:21.770]  Are you not feeding them long enough?
[22:21.770 --> 22:23.530]  Are you feeding them too long?
[22:23.530 --> 22:26.410]  Are you feeding anything to enhance the terpenes?
[22:26.410 --> 22:28.450]  Are you giving it anything to make it smell good?
[22:28.450 --> 22:30.290]  What are you doing?
[22:30.290 --> 22:31.930]  There are several things that I would check on.
[22:31.930 --> 22:34.610]  I would check on, like I've already said, temperature.
[22:34.610 --> 22:37.690]  That's my number one culprit for killing terps.
[22:37.690 --> 22:39.330]  Then I would check on light intensity.
[22:39.330 --> 22:41.370]  How far from the canopy is your light?
[22:41.370 --> 22:43.090]  Is it just roasting your terps?
[22:43.090 --> 22:45.570]  You should be able to tell by looking at the plants.
[22:45.570 --> 22:47.510]  Do you have plenty of airflow in there?
[22:47.510 --> 22:48.890]  Do you have bugs?
[22:48.890 --> 22:52.930]  Then I would make sure that you're feeding something to encourage healthy plants.
[22:52.930 --> 22:53.930]  I can't see the room.
[22:53.930 --> 22:58.530]  I don't have a lot of details, but those are things that I do think could make plants lose
[22:58.530 --> 23:00.890]  their smell at the end of flower.
[23:00.890 --> 23:05.770]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pamps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[23:05.770 --> 23:09.490]  clone cutters, and pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there,

[23:13.450 --> 23:15.450]  This one may get short after a little bit of editing.
[23:15.450 --> 23:19.210]  I do apologize if I have to cut a bunch of nonsense out of the middle of this.
[23:19.210 --> 23:21.530]  I got quite rambly, lost my track.
[23:21.530 --> 23:25.290]  Anyway, if you feel like this episode was educational, informative, or entertaining,
