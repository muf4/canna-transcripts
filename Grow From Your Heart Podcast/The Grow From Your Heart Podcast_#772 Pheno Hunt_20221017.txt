[00:01.080 --> 00:19.830]  All right, here we go.
[00:19.830 --> 00:21.470]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:21.470 --> 00:24.050]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:24.050 --> 00:29.030]  This is episode 772 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:29.030 --> 00:32.590]  In this episode, I'm going to talk a little bit about phenotype selection.
[00:32.590 --> 00:35.870]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do some shout outs to a few of those great
[00:35.870 --> 00:39.590]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.

[00:54.070 --> 00:57.110]  Want to send a thank you shout out to my friend Yee Motherfucking Ha.
[00:57.110 --> 00:59.910]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Lefty's Farm.
[00:59.910 --> 01:03.170]  Want to send a big thank you shout out to my friends at Lollipop Farms.

[01:05.610 --> 01:09.410]  And let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:09.410 --> 01:11.090]  to my buddy Sonic.
[01:11.090 --> 01:16.050]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[01:34.250 --> 01:36.770]  to support the show.
[01:36.770 --> 01:41.370]  I do want to give a big shout out to my friends at the DGC, the Dude Grow Show, the Dude Grows
[01:41.370 --> 01:42.370]  crew.
[01:42.370 --> 01:44.370]  They did invite me to be a guest on the podcast.
[01:44.370 --> 01:46.090]  I've made two appearances recently.
[01:46.090 --> 01:47.770]  You may recognize this t-shirt.
[01:47.770 --> 01:49.910]  I was on the Dude Grow Show today.
[01:49.910 --> 01:51.810]  We recorded a great segment.
[01:51.810 --> 01:53.250]  Do look forward to that coming out.
[01:53.250 --> 01:56.970]  I'm not sure their production schedule when they're going to drop the episode but it should
[01:56.970 --> 02:00.930]  be fairly close to the same time that this episode does come out.
[02:00.930 --> 02:04.370]  Once again, thanks to all of my friends at the Dude Grows Show.
[02:04.370 --> 02:08.730]  Big up to everybody over there, the Dude, Scotty, and of course our new friend, Graham
[02:08.730 --> 02:09.730]  Bowe.
[02:09.730 --> 02:10.730]  Big shout out, bro.
[02:10.730 --> 02:11.730]  Thank you.
[02:11.730 --> 02:13.610]  Of course, shout out to everybody, the old school crew and the new crew.
[02:13.610 --> 02:17.050]  If you just discovered me from the Dude Grows Show, thanks for joining us, you guys.
[02:17.050 --> 02:19.170]  I'm proud to be part of the Dude Grows crew.
[02:19.170 --> 02:22.890]  Iree Army Dude Grows crew is a very parallel crew.
[02:22.890 --> 02:24.970]  We like being a team together so shout out.
[02:24.970 --> 02:30.770]  I don't feel any sort of competition or territorial insecurity crap when it comes to multiple
[02:30.810 --> 02:31.810]  podcasts.
[02:31.810 --> 02:35.050]  I think we should all do our own shows and help everybody and be a community.
[02:35.050 --> 02:36.930]  There's no reason why we shouldn't work together.
[02:36.930 --> 02:38.530]  We're all aiming for the same goal.
[02:38.530 --> 02:42.210]  We all want you guys to grow the best herb and we want to legalize our favorite plant
[02:42.210 --> 02:43.210]  so we work together.
[02:43.210 --> 02:44.210]  I love it.
[02:44.210 --> 02:45.210]  Big up to the whole crew.
[02:45.210 --> 02:47.330]  Also, a big shout out to my friend, JH.
[02:47.330 --> 02:51.250]  If you did get the same t-shirt joke, you're the only one going to get the joke, bro.
[02:51.250 --> 02:52.250]  Hope you laughed at that.
[02:52.250 --> 02:53.250]  All right.
[02:53.250 --> 02:54.250]  Shout out to the Dude Grows crew.
[02:54.250 --> 02:55.250]  Look forward to the episode.
[02:55.250 --> 02:56.370]  I will be on there more.
[02:56.370 --> 02:59.850]  We did talk about me going on that show more frequently.
[02:59.930 --> 03:03.610]  Now that I'm only doing one episode per week here, it does allow me to do a little bit
[03:03.610 --> 03:05.890]  more guest spot time.
[03:05.890 --> 03:06.890]  Doorbell rang.
[03:06.890 --> 03:07.890]  Excuse me.
[03:07.890 --> 03:08.890]  I'm going to go grab that.
[03:08.890 --> 03:09.890]  All right.
[03:09.890 --> 03:10.890]  I am back.
[03:10.890 --> 03:11.890]  I do apologize.
[03:11.890 --> 03:13.170]  I am recording here in the middle of the day so we did receive a package at the door.
[03:13.170 --> 03:16.330]  I can't leave packages out there too long because other people will decide that that
[03:16.330 --> 03:18.970]  is a gift or donation if they see it on the porch.
[03:18.970 --> 03:19.970]  Had to go get that.
[03:19.970 --> 03:20.970]  You don't care a lot.
[03:20.970 --> 03:22.170]  Let's continue with this podcast.
[03:22.170 --> 03:23.650]  Where was I?
[03:23.650 --> 03:26.050]  Let's talk about something that we have all seen in the news.
[03:26.050 --> 03:28.610]  All of the cannabis podcasts should talk about this.
[03:28.610 --> 03:32.490]  This is something that got quite a few people kind of excited, kind of riled up, and then
[03:32.490 --> 03:34.530]  we saw a lot of responses to this.
[03:34.530 --> 03:38.650]  Of course, I am referring to the statement that Joe Biden made about freeing federal
[03:38.650 --> 03:43.130]  cannabis prisoners who were in federal prison for petty cannabis crimes.
[03:43.130 --> 03:46.070]  Let's talk really briefly about what Biden said there.
[03:46.070 --> 03:49.110]  He just said a bunch of bullshit to make people think he was going to do something.
[03:49.110 --> 03:50.630]  He didn't say anything useful.
[03:50.630 --> 03:52.350]  He didn't do anything useful.
[03:52.350 --> 03:54.550]  Let's break down what he said really quickly here.
[03:54.550 --> 04:00.670]  He was going to free federal cannabis prisoners who were in federal prison for minor cannabis
[04:00.670 --> 04:01.670]  crimes.
[04:01.670 --> 04:04.230]  If you commit a minor cannabis crime, you don't go to federal prison.
[04:04.230 --> 04:06.990]  A federal crime is how you go to federal prison.
[04:06.990 --> 04:10.350]  So those minor cannabis crimes went to county jail.
[04:10.350 --> 04:12.670]  The federal crimes went to federal prison.
[04:12.670 --> 04:14.110]  Guess who he released?
[04:14.110 --> 04:15.110]  Fucking nobody.
[04:15.110 --> 04:16.110]  So that was just some bullshit.
[04:16.110 --> 04:17.710]  That was just a sales pitch.
[04:17.710 --> 04:20.790]  That was just a greeting card to make you feel like something went well.
[04:20.790 --> 04:23.510]  Didn't really do a lot for the movement, for the plant, for the people.
[04:23.510 --> 04:27.750]  If some people, if I am misinformed, uneducated, and some people did get released, that is
[04:27.750 --> 04:28.750]  fucking awesome.
[04:28.750 --> 04:32.510]  If you pardoned one or two people, that is great, but it's not the move that we all thought
[04:32.510 --> 04:33.950]  he was talking about making.
[04:33.950 --> 04:35.190]  Some people were duped.
[04:35.190 --> 04:36.390]  Some people were fooled.
[04:36.390 --> 04:37.430]  It was a clever statement.
[04:37.430 --> 04:40.510]  I think it was a sales pitch and it did not work on me.
[04:40.510 --> 04:45.790]  I think that what he said was, it was just some frosting or a bandaid or just some decoration
[04:45.790 --> 04:47.590]  and I didn't buy the bullshit.
[04:47.590 --> 04:49.790]  So I wanted to give you my opinion on that.
[04:49.790 --> 04:54.270]  He said he freed all of the federal cannabis prisoners who were in prison for minor cannabis
[04:54.270 --> 04:55.550]  crimes.
[04:55.550 --> 04:58.550]  Once again, you don't go to a federal prison for a minor cannabis crime.
[04:58.550 --> 04:59.790]  You never made it that far.
[04:59.790 --> 05:01.190]  There was nobody to free.
[05:01.190 --> 05:03.750]  All right, that was my ramble on that.
[05:03.750 --> 05:06.330]  Let's talk about something more fun, more exciting.
[05:06.330 --> 05:10.790]  If you've been following along, you do know that I had a greenhouse running and I did
[05:10.790 --> 05:12.490]  harvest the plants.
[05:12.490 --> 05:13.490]  Everything is down now.
[05:13.490 --> 05:16.390]  There were a couple of plants still in there until recently.
[05:16.390 --> 05:18.590]  Some longstanding, some late finishers.
[05:18.590 --> 05:20.550]  There were plants that I did not expect to take so long.
[05:20.550 --> 05:25.310]  That took a really long time this year, but they are down there in the plants are drying.
[05:25.310 --> 05:27.710]  A lot of the plants have been processed.
[05:27.710 --> 05:28.710]  Seeds are coming out.
[05:28.710 --> 05:29.710]  Things are getting counted.
[05:29.710 --> 05:35.150]  I'm excited because I think that by Halloween I should be able to re drop the blueberry
[05:35.150 --> 05:36.150]  butcher.
[05:36.150 --> 05:38.990]  That's right on iredirect.com on other vendors.
[05:38.990 --> 05:42.070]  There will be a restock of blueberry butcher by Halloween.
[05:42.070 --> 05:44.390]  You say that 10 times fast.
[05:44.390 --> 05:48.150]  Blueberry butcher is back in stock bro around Halloween time.
[05:48.710 --> 05:52.750]  I do plan a sale and a Halloween drop for the restock of blueberry butcher.
[05:52.750 --> 05:55.230]  There will be more stuff that drops along with that.
[05:55.230 --> 05:56.990]  There will be some freebies.
[05:56.990 --> 05:59.670]  Every order on iredirect.com does come with freebies.
[05:59.670 --> 06:01.590]  I load you up for sure.
[06:01.590 --> 06:04.550]  It's kind of a depending on if you buy cheap packs or more expensive packs.
[06:04.550 --> 06:08.310]  It depends on if I load you up with five packs or 10 packs or fems for free.
[06:08.310 --> 06:12.670]  Basically it's a pretty close to buy one, get one free ratio with the amount of freebies
[06:12.670 --> 06:14.510]  that you do get, but I am rambling.
[06:14.510 --> 06:17.310]  The blueberry butcher drop will happen around Halloween.
[06:17.470 --> 06:19.550]  There will be some new stuff there.
[06:19.550 --> 06:23.430]  Also you guys have heard me talk about the feminized seeds that I have got coming.
[06:23.430 --> 06:25.230]  Those are harvested as well.
[06:25.230 --> 06:26.230]  Those plants are kind of big.
[06:26.230 --> 06:31.350]  They're taking longer to dry than anticipated, but as soon as they're dried, processed, counted,
[06:31.350 --> 06:36.570]  all of that good shit, I will get you guys the feminized lemon Jeffrey, the feminized
[06:36.570 --> 06:42.950]  orange chasm and the feminized golden goat S1s will be back very, very soon.
[06:42.950 --> 06:45.990]  The best way to stay updated on that is to join my newsletter.
[06:45.990 --> 06:49.830]  Go to my website, I read genetics.com on the bottom of the page.
[06:49.830 --> 06:53.670]  There is a newsletter tab where you can fill in your email address, click on that and it
[06:53.670 --> 06:56.710]  will update your email address in my newsletter.
[06:56.710 --> 07:00.790]  When I put out new drops, when I put out specials, when I do promotions or advertising, I do
[07:00.790 --> 07:02.910]  send out a mail chimp newsletter.
[07:02.910 --> 07:07.430]  I really only try to do it about once a month, maybe every six weeks because I don't want
[07:07.430 --> 07:10.830]  to overload you and bombard you with spam emails.
[07:10.830 --> 07:15.710]  I just want to remind you that, Hey, I put hoodies on sale or Hey, I put seeds on sale
[07:15.750 --> 07:19.710]  or Hey, there's a new drop coming or Hey, there's a secret coupon code.
[07:19.710 --> 07:23.910]  The best way to stay updated with all of that stuff is of course through the newsletter
[07:23.910 --> 07:26.270]  at I read genetics.com.
[07:26.270 --> 07:27.670]  I did mention hoodies.
[07:27.670 --> 07:28.670]  That's right.
[07:28.670 --> 07:29.670]  I just ordered more.
[07:29.670 --> 07:31.150]  I read genetics t-shirts.
[07:31.150 --> 07:35.870]  I ordered black long sleeve t-shirts and I ordered black hoodies and for the ladies,
[07:35.870 --> 07:36.990]  I ordered a few.
[07:36.990 --> 07:38.670]  I read genetics tank tops.
[07:38.670 --> 07:43.430]  They've all got the square logo with the cross that says I read genetics premium seeds.
[07:43.430 --> 07:47.390]  People have been asking for more designs, more ideas, so we put that logo on a few different
[07:47.390 --> 07:52.910]  items, a long sleeve, black shirts, black t-shirts, black hoodies, and black tank tops.
[07:52.910 --> 07:53.910]  We will branch out here.
[07:53.910 --> 07:55.790]  I was trying to get all the bases covered.
[07:55.790 --> 07:59.330]  Once we got the basics covered, I will expand the merchandise line.
[07:59.330 --> 08:03.470]  If you've got recommendations or suggestions, send me those ideas at grow from your heart
[08:03.470 --> 08:04.470]  at hotmail.com.
[08:04.470 --> 08:06.950]  It can be grow from your heart idea merchandise.
[08:06.950 --> 08:11.150]  It could be I read genetics merchandise, whatever you've got in mind, please do hook me up.
[08:11.150 --> 08:14.390]  I love making merchandise that I know you guys are interested in.
[08:14.390 --> 08:15.390]  That's the point, right?
[08:15.390 --> 08:17.310]  I could design shit that I like all day.
[08:17.310 --> 08:18.550]  I want to know if you like it.
[08:18.550 --> 08:23.310]  Also, if you're an artist out there, I could use a discreet I read genetics and I read
[08:23.310 --> 08:28.390]  army logo, something that people in prohibition states could wear and they could proudly represent
[08:28.390 --> 08:31.990]  I read genetics, the grow from your heart podcast or the I read army.
[08:31.990 --> 08:35.630]  They could represent all of that stuff but not tell their boss, their community, their
[08:35.630 --> 08:40.150]  neighbors, the preschool teacher, the daycare worker that they are cannabis growers and
[08:40.150 --> 08:41.150]  consumers.
[08:41.150 --> 08:43.950]  So if you want to whip up a cool logo, please do send me your ideas.
[08:43.950 --> 08:47.550]  I will definitely take good care of my favorite logos.
[08:47.550 --> 08:50.070]  Alright, that is enough rambling here at the start of the show.
[08:50.070 --> 08:54.990]  I did say that I was going to talk about Fino type selection and a Fino hunt.
[08:54.990 --> 08:58.150]  Let me segue into rambling a little bit about that.
[08:58.150 --> 09:02.550]  I feel like a good spot to start would be by explaining what a Fino hunt is.
[09:02.550 --> 09:04.470]  What do I mean by a Fino hunt?
[09:04.470 --> 09:09.910]  A Fino hunt is simply searching through a population of seeds to find the Fino type
[09:09.910 --> 09:14.950]  of those plants that works the best for you, your garden, your clients, your needs or your
[09:14.950 --> 09:16.910]  patients, whatever it may be.
[09:16.910 --> 09:18.950]  Now what do I mean by Fino type?
[09:18.950 --> 09:23.750]  When we grow from seed, we will see variation amongst the different plants.
[09:23.750 --> 09:26.450]  That is known as a Fino typical expression.
[09:26.450 --> 09:28.750]  Some plants, so we may have a 10 pack of seeds.
[09:28.750 --> 09:32.630]  If they are regular seeds, most of the time, half of those are going to be males.
[09:32.630 --> 09:34.110]  We pull the boys out of there.
[09:34.250 --> 09:36.310]  We've got five girl plants to grow.
[09:36.310 --> 09:40.510]  Most of the time, you're going to see plants that look a little bit like the mother plant,
[09:40.510 --> 09:43.830]  plants that look a little bit like the father plant, and then plants that look like kind
[09:43.830 --> 09:44.910]  of combinations of those.
[09:44.910 --> 09:46.910]  I call those the 50-50s.
[09:46.910 --> 09:51.990]  Those are usually my intended and favorite Fino types, but that's a whole different conversation.
[09:51.990 --> 09:56.010]  Just like if you've got brothers or sisters, you don't look exactly the same, but you came
[09:56.010 --> 09:57.730]  from the exact same parents.
[09:57.730 --> 09:58.970]  Maybe you do look very similar.
[09:58.970 --> 10:01.310]  That's also a Fino typical expression.
[10:01.310 --> 10:02.710]  Maybe you've got blue eyes.
[10:02.710 --> 10:04.090]  Your sister's got green eyes.
[10:04.090 --> 10:07.050]  Maybe you've got brown hair and your sister's got blonde hair.
[10:07.050 --> 10:12.370]  That is a Fino typical expression and variation that happens amongst Fino types, amongst a
[10:12.370 --> 10:13.370]  population.
[10:13.370 --> 10:16.490]  So, with plants, some plants may be taller than others.
[10:16.490 --> 10:18.210]  Some may be shorter than others.
[10:18.210 --> 10:19.590]  Some may get a lot of resin.
[10:19.590 --> 10:21.310]  Some may not make any resin.
[10:21.310 --> 10:22.710]  Some may have a certain aroma.
[10:22.710 --> 10:24.610]  Some may have way different aromas.
[10:24.610 --> 10:28.410]  These are all traits that we will see as Fino typical expression.
[10:28.410 --> 10:33.930]  So when I talk about a Fino hunt, I'm talking about finding the Fino type out of a population
[10:33.970 --> 10:35.970]  that works best for my needs.
[10:35.970 --> 10:40.130]  Now, let me get off on a tangent here because being a breeder, being the person that is
[10:40.130 --> 10:44.690]  making a lot of these seeds and that has a lot of experience with the lines that I make,
[10:44.690 --> 10:46.690]  when I make these seeds, I get to grow them first.
[10:46.690 --> 10:50.370]  I get to play with them as long as I want before I even let you know about it or sell
[10:50.370 --> 10:51.970]  them to you or give them to you.
[10:51.970 --> 10:52.970]  I've got those seeds.
[10:52.970 --> 10:56.490]  I've been running them a lot, so I know what to expect.
[10:56.490 --> 11:01.650]  Before you get the seeds, I can tell you what Fino types will show up and the traits of
[11:01.650 --> 11:05.710]  those Fino types that you can expect from a pack of seeds because I've got experience
[11:05.710 --> 11:06.710]  running it.
[11:06.710 --> 11:09.490]  I've ran the seeds so much that I know what it's going to show me.
[11:09.490 --> 11:14.530]  Now when I talk about Fino typical selection, people often say, which Fino type is the best
[11:14.530 --> 11:17.030]  out of this line of seeds?
[11:17.030 --> 11:18.970]  That is not for me to decide.
[11:18.970 --> 11:21.710]  I often describe it like this.
[11:21.710 --> 11:25.370]  You wanted a pack of, let me just say strawberry starburst seeds.
[11:25.370 --> 11:29.730]  You know that you want the seeds that have the strawberry candy flavor and aroma.
[11:29.730 --> 11:31.170]  They make really good concentrates.
[11:31.690 --> 11:33.130]  It's got a really nice sativa buzz.
[11:33.130 --> 11:34.690]  We know that that's as far as we've gotten.
[11:34.690 --> 11:38.050]  Now there's a Fino type in there that's going to be perfect for you and one that won't be
[11:38.050 --> 11:40.470]  the best for you and one that'll be pretty good.
[11:40.470 --> 11:44.930]  The way I describe this is we've all chosen that we want to eat at the Italian restaurant,
[11:44.930 --> 11:45.930]  right?
[11:45.930 --> 11:47.630]  We've all chosen we want the Italian restaurant.
[11:47.630 --> 11:50.010]  That's your strawberry starburst pack of seeds.
[11:50.010 --> 11:53.330]  When we get to the Italian restaurant, we're going to get a menu.
[11:53.330 --> 11:54.950]  Somebody's going to want white sauce.
[11:54.950 --> 11:58.850]  Somebody's going to want red sauce and somebody's going to want eggplant Parmesan.
[11:58.850 --> 12:00.050]  Somebody's going to want gnocchi.
[12:00.050 --> 12:01.690]  Somebody's going to want pasta.
[12:01.690 --> 12:04.690]  There's a million kinds of pasta, gnocchi or spaghetti.
[12:04.690 --> 12:07.090]  Those are all things that are at the Italian restaurant.
[12:07.090 --> 12:08.290]  They're all very acceptable.
[12:08.290 --> 12:09.730]  They're all very delicious.
[12:09.730 --> 12:13.190]  They're all kind of the same because they're Italian food made in the same restaurant,
[12:13.190 --> 12:16.650]  but there's going to be little variations and differences.
[12:16.650 --> 12:20.490]  That's what I think we find when we go growing from a pack of seeds.
[12:20.490 --> 12:24.090]  You've got the Italian restaurant, that's your pack of strawberry starburst seeds.
[12:24.090 --> 12:27.250]  Now you got to find the Fino type that expresses the traits that you want.
[12:27.250 --> 12:30.010]  Do you want the marinara or do you want the garlic sauce?
[12:30.010 --> 12:34.010]  When it comes to the seeds to the strawberry starburst plant, do you want the one that
[12:34.010 --> 12:38.850]  tastes more like watermelons or bubblegum candy or the one that's got that weird sour
[12:38.850 --> 12:42.390]  sort of a tangy and watermelon and grapefruit sort of aroma?
[12:42.390 --> 12:44.010]  That's for you to decide.
[12:44.010 --> 12:47.950]  I like the one that tastes like strawberry bubblegum, but that's just me.
[12:47.950 --> 12:51.190]  My buddy Kelvin likes the one that tastes like juicy watermelons.
[12:51.190 --> 12:52.610]  That's the phenotypical.
[12:52.610 --> 12:56.810]  That is the phenotype that will get your attention that you ... That is the trait and the phenotype
[12:56.810 --> 12:59.850]  that will get your attention that works best for you.
[13:00.370 --> 13:02.850]  The phenotype that works for me may not be best for you.
[13:02.850 --> 13:03.850]  Are you smoking?
[13:03.850 --> 13:05.690]  I like to get really high.
[13:05.690 --> 13:09.510]  I like a head buzz that makes me paranoid and fucking forget what I'm saying and lose
[13:09.510 --> 13:13.170]  my keys when they're in my hand and lose my sunglasses when I'm wearing them.
[13:13.170 --> 13:17.610]  A lot of people don't desire that, so we may want totally different phenotypes.
[13:17.610 --> 13:19.770]  I've got a grow space that's eight feet tall.
[13:19.770 --> 13:21.790]  Maybe you've got a three foot tall grow space.
[13:21.790 --> 13:24.430]  My phenotypes aren't going to work in your grow space.
[13:24.430 --> 13:29.830]  My best advice is to pick the phenotype that works best for you, in your environment, for
[13:29.830 --> 13:30.990]  your needs.
[13:30.990 --> 13:33.230]  Like I said before, maybe it's a medical product.
[13:33.230 --> 13:35.070]  Maybe it's a retail product.
[13:35.070 --> 13:36.870]  Maybe it's a gray market product.
[13:36.870 --> 13:38.490]  Maybe you're making concentrates out of it.
[13:38.490 --> 13:40.430]  Maybe you're making edibles out of it.
[13:40.430 --> 13:45.470]  Select the phenotype that performs the way that you need that phenotype to perform for
[13:45.470 --> 13:47.710]  you to reach your goal.
[13:47.710 --> 13:51.310]  Let's talk a little bit about the method of a pheno hunt.
[13:51.310 --> 13:55.110]  A pheno hunt can happen with a little bit of seeds or a lot of seeds.
[13:55.110 --> 13:58.550]  It can happen in a little bit of space or a lot of space.
[13:58.550 --> 14:01.630]  If I'm hunting for something, I don't grow the plants very big.
[14:01.630 --> 14:03.350]  I keep them small.
[14:03.350 --> 14:04.990]  Sometimes I don't even take a clone.
[14:04.990 --> 14:07.030]  Sometimes I just rely on a reveg.
[14:07.030 --> 14:10.590]  I'm mainly looking for the one keeper out of a population.
[14:10.590 --> 14:11.790]  Maybe I took a clone of it.
[14:11.790 --> 14:12.790]  Maybe I didn't.
[14:12.790 --> 14:16.430]  If I did not get the clone, then I will rely on that reveg and it will be worth the work
[14:16.430 --> 14:20.750]  because it was the keeper out of however many plants, which means that's the one I want,
[14:20.750 --> 14:22.910]  it will be worth doing the extra work.
[14:22.910 --> 14:26.970]  So whatever amount of space you've got, whatever amount of seeds you got, let's utilize that
[14:26.970 --> 14:28.370]  to the best of our ability.
[14:28.370 --> 14:31.390]  Maybe small plants, short veg time.
[14:31.390 --> 14:36.630]  When I'm doing a pheno hunt, I do not manipulate the plants very much on their first run.
[14:36.630 --> 14:40.710]  I will sprout, let's just say you've got, okay, let's do a couple of things.
[14:40.710 --> 14:41.790]  We've got two options.
[14:41.790 --> 14:43.510]  Maybe you've got 100 seeds.
[14:43.510 --> 14:45.270]  Maybe you've got 10 seeds.
[14:45.270 --> 14:48.670]  Where I live, I'm only allowed to grow 12 plants at a time.
[14:48.670 --> 14:52.470]  So in my pheno hunt, let's just say I've already got two plants as mother plants.
[14:52.470 --> 14:53.630]  They're over there in the corner.
[14:53.630 --> 14:56.390]  I've got 10 plants that I'm allowed to work with.
[14:56.390 --> 14:59.790]  I would pack a, I would pop a 10 pack of seeds.
[14:59.790 --> 15:01.510]  That gives me 10 seeds to work with.
[15:01.510 --> 15:05.150]  Eventually, like I've said before, we're going to pull out five because they'll probably
[15:05.150 --> 15:06.350]  be males.
[15:06.350 --> 15:09.310]  So I'm going to grow these 10 seeds exactly the same.
[15:09.310 --> 15:12.990]  I'm going to put them in a room and I'm going to treat them all exactly the same.
[15:12.990 --> 15:15.950]  They get the same soil, the same size pot.
[15:15.950 --> 15:17.430]  They get the same amount of light.
[15:17.430 --> 15:19.270]  They get fed the exact same thing.
[15:19.270 --> 15:21.430]  They get defoliated the same amount.
[15:21.430 --> 15:25.670]  If I do any manipulation to plant one, it happens to plant one through 10.
[15:25.670 --> 15:28.110]  All the other plants are getting the same treatment.
[15:28.110 --> 15:33.490]  This is the only way to keep it fair, scientific, and to actually make a real discernible determination
[15:33.490 --> 15:36.910]  on which plant is the best or most desirable out of a group.
[15:36.910 --> 15:40.530]  So I will grow all these plants exactly the fucking same.
[15:40.530 --> 15:43.670]  And then somewhere around week six or seven, you'll start making decisions.
[15:43.670 --> 15:47.470]  You'll go, this one right here has a lot of resin, but this one right here is making
[15:47.470 --> 15:48.870]  a lot of weed.
[15:48.870 --> 15:52.470]  And then there'll be another one that doesn't make as much resin or as much weed, but smells
[15:52.470 --> 15:54.070]  and tastes really good.
[15:54.070 --> 15:56.310]  That's usually the way that a phenol hunt goes.
[15:56.310 --> 15:59.390]  But keep growing those plants, grow them all the way through.
[15:59.390 --> 16:00.390]  Grow them, harvest them.
[16:00.390 --> 16:02.870]  If you plan on revegging, leave a little bit.
[16:02.870 --> 16:03.870]  Dry and cure them.
[16:03.870 --> 16:05.670]  Now here comes the fun part.
[16:05.670 --> 16:09.270]  If you are growing these plants to share with friends or patients or clients or whoever
[16:09.270 --> 16:11.790]  it may be, gather a few of them around.
[16:11.790 --> 16:13.350]  Let's have a smoke party.
[16:14.030 --> 16:17.470]  Let's roll up a couple of joints of phenotype number one, phenotype number two, number three.
[16:17.470 --> 16:18.470]  Label them.
[16:18.470 --> 16:21.490]  Let's smoke them with the whole crew and see who desires what.
[16:21.490 --> 16:24.230]  If you're growing it for yourself, pick the one you like the best.
[16:24.230 --> 16:27.710]  If you're the grower, if you're going to breed with it, if you've got goals, you make the
[16:27.710 --> 16:28.710]  selection.
[16:28.710 --> 16:30.990]  That's the advantage of being the grower, the farmer.
[16:30.990 --> 16:32.550]  You get to make that final decision.
[16:32.550 --> 16:34.950]  You can let people say, I like this one the best.
[16:34.950 --> 16:37.790]  I like this one the best, but overall, it's your decision.
[16:37.790 --> 16:39.590]  So start some seeds.
[16:39.590 --> 16:40.590]  Keep a good eye on them.
[16:40.590 --> 16:41.590]  Take a lot of notes.
[16:41.590 --> 16:43.510]  Make them all exactly the same.
[16:43.510 --> 16:46.350]  Finish them, dry them, cure them, smoke them.
[16:46.350 --> 16:49.310]  Then decide which one was your favorite.
[16:49.310 --> 16:51.830]  That is your keeper out of your pheno hunt.
[16:51.830 --> 16:55.710]  Sometimes, like I said before, you'll find two or three that are the winners out of a
[16:55.710 --> 16:56.710]  pheno hunt.
[16:56.710 --> 16:58.830]  I kind of treat that like a bracket system.
[16:58.830 --> 17:01.550]  I will revege those or have clones of those three.
[17:01.550 --> 17:05.390]  Then I will run them all three side by side in a room kind of focused into just those
[17:05.390 --> 17:09.830]  three and I'll see what works the best for me out of those three.
[17:09.830 --> 17:10.830]  Sometimes I keep two.
[17:11.070 --> 17:12.070]  Sometimes I keep one.
[17:12.070 --> 17:15.630]  Sometimes I'll keep the tall one for myself and send the short one to a friend so that
[17:15.630 --> 17:18.310]  he can run that also and kind of experiment with that.
[17:18.310 --> 17:20.030]  We can see what we can do with breeding.
[17:20.030 --> 17:22.910]  I'll breed to both of them, see what the breeding does on both.
[17:22.910 --> 17:24.390]  Just phenotypical selection.
[17:24.390 --> 17:25.390]  So I'll keep the taller one.
[17:25.390 --> 17:28.150]  He'll get the shorter one, but find the one that you like the best.
[17:28.150 --> 17:29.150]  Narrow it down.
[17:29.150 --> 17:33.590]  Now, a minute ago, I said we could do a pheno hunt from 100 seeds.
[17:33.590 --> 17:34.590]  It would be ideal.
[17:34.590 --> 17:39.470]  It would be really fun to run 100 at a time, but at that rate, you might need 100 clones
[17:39.470 --> 17:40.630]  if you want to clone it.
[17:40.630 --> 17:42.990]  At that rate, you've got to manage 100 plants.
[17:42.990 --> 17:46.190]  In most areas, that's illegal, so we can't do that.
[17:46.190 --> 17:51.070]  The way that we can do this is if you can run 10 at a time or this works however many
[17:51.070 --> 17:54.670]  you can run at a time, max out and then do the math on this.
[17:54.670 --> 17:57.870]  Let's just say you've got 100 seeds and you can run 10 at a time.
[17:57.870 --> 17:59.150]  Run 10 seeds.
[17:59.150 --> 18:01.390]  Pick your favorite out of those 10.
[18:01.390 --> 18:02.630]  Keep a clone of that.
[18:02.630 --> 18:05.270]  Sprout nine more seeds.
[18:05.270 --> 18:09.670]  Run that clone and those nine seeds right next to each other and once again, pick the
[18:09.710 --> 18:11.190]  best out of all of those.
[18:11.190 --> 18:15.710]  That first clone you kept last time does not have to be the keeper out of the next round.
[18:15.710 --> 18:18.590]  Work it like a bracket system, an elimination match.
[18:18.590 --> 18:20.630]  You won the last fucking Royal Rumble.
[18:20.630 --> 18:23.630]  Get in the ring with 10 more and see if you survive.
[18:23.630 --> 18:27.510]  Every time, as long as you select a phenotype that you think is better through every pheno
[18:27.510 --> 18:29.590]  hunt, you're making forward progress.
[18:29.590 --> 18:32.150]  You're also making product every time you grow.
[18:32.150 --> 18:36.670]  It's not like a waste of time or a waste of space because you're producing those plants.
[18:36.670 --> 18:41.030]  It may not be the most desirable, the most sellable, most profitable smoke ever, but
[18:41.030 --> 18:44.630]  you're going to produce a quality product out of each one of those seeds if you do it
[18:44.630 --> 18:45.630]  correctly.
[18:45.630 --> 18:49.590]  And that is a good way to segue into another thing that I wanted to make sure to cover.
[18:49.590 --> 18:54.190]  Too many people expect to plant a seed and find the perfect phenotype.
[18:54.190 --> 18:57.470]  I don't like just, that's why I don't sell one or two seeds to people.
[18:57.470 --> 19:01.870]  That's why you've got to buy a pack of seeds because that's not a good representation.
[19:01.870 --> 19:06.670]  First of all, if you buy one seed and it doesn't germinate, you've got a 100% non-germination
[19:06.670 --> 19:08.910]  rate and that looks really bad on a breeder.
[19:08.910 --> 19:11.990]  We try to give you more seeds to at least get some to germinate.
[19:11.990 --> 19:12.990]  We don't want you to complain.
[19:12.990 --> 19:15.230]  It gives you better numbers, a better ratio.
[19:15.230 --> 19:18.070]  I've tested my germination rates.
[19:18.070 --> 19:19.070]  Testers have tested it.
[19:19.070 --> 19:21.750]  Growers, customers have tested that.
[19:21.750 --> 19:25.470]  We know the seeds are reliable, but it still feels weird selling you one or two because
[19:25.470 --> 19:30.550]  then you've got a chance of a 100% or 50% failure rate and that could be my fault.
[19:31.430 --> 19:35.070]  It could have gotten too hot in shipping or that simply could be customer error and I
[19:35.070 --> 19:38.190]  don't want to allow for that sort of a ratio.
[19:38.190 --> 19:42.470]  I think you should run, that's why when you get one seed or two seeds, I think you should
[19:42.470 --> 19:45.910]  run more than that to actually find the phenotype that you want.
[19:45.910 --> 19:50.350]  Too many people think that their first grow is going to be the grow where they find the
[19:50.350 --> 19:51.350]  gold.
[19:51.350 --> 19:54.350]  I think you've got to run a pack, maybe two, maybe three packs of seeds.
[19:54.350 --> 19:56.550]  It's kind of like dating in my opinion.
[19:56.550 --> 20:00.590]  If you just find one person and fall in love right off the bat, that's great, but that's
[20:00.590 --> 20:01.590]  not common.
[20:01.590 --> 20:05.670]  You've got to kind of play the field and see, does that kind of person make me happy?
[20:05.670 --> 20:07.110]  Does this person make me happy?
[20:07.110 --> 20:08.110]  Figure it out.
[20:08.110 --> 20:09.350]  You're not locked into one plant.
[20:09.350 --> 20:11.110]  Date a little bit with these plants is what I'm saying.
[20:11.110 --> 20:12.950]  I'm sorry for the bad dating analogy.
[20:12.950 --> 20:16.410]  I haven't done that in a while, so I'm fucking confused.
[20:16.410 --> 20:20.350]  Find out which plant you like the best and stick with that and then grow that one over
[20:20.350 --> 20:21.510]  and over again.
[20:21.510 --> 20:23.810]  Then develop a relationship with that plant.
[20:23.810 --> 20:27.890]  The first couple times you grow it, it'll come out pretty good, but imagine if you learned
[20:27.890 --> 20:31.530]  that like in week six, I could drop out the cow mag and really add bloom boosters and
[20:31.530 --> 20:35.810]  it goes shebang, or maybe the opposite, or maybe you need to feed it nitrogen just a
[20:35.810 --> 20:39.970]  little bit longer, or maybe you discover that if you let it go five extra days, it really
[20:39.970 --> 20:41.970]  puts on more weight.
[20:41.970 --> 20:42.970]  Experiment with this plant.
[20:42.970 --> 20:44.330]  So run a pheno hunt.
[20:44.330 --> 20:46.770]  Start with the population of seeds and grow them.
[20:46.770 --> 20:49.970]  Treat them all exactly the same to keep it scientific.
[20:49.970 --> 20:52.290]  Try them, cure them, smoke them.
[20:52.290 --> 20:54.590]  Determine your favorites out of that population.
[20:54.590 --> 20:56.030]  That is your keeper phenotype.
[20:56.030 --> 20:58.210]  That is the basics of a pheno hunt.
[20:58.210 --> 21:02.010]  If you've got more seeds of the same thing or if you've got different seeds and you're
[21:02.010 --> 21:05.890]  looking to keep the best plant around, run another pheno hunt.
[21:05.890 --> 21:10.090]  Put that one plant that won the last round in up against all those other plants and see
[21:10.090 --> 21:11.090]  who is the winner.
[21:11.090 --> 21:12.910]  I called it the Royal Rumble before.
[21:12.910 --> 21:16.610]  Keep the Royal Rumble going until you've got the best plant you can find.
[21:16.610 --> 21:20.730]  If you're looking to stock a stable of mother plants, repeat this process until you've got
[21:20.730 --> 21:23.410]  10 of the best mother plants you can find.
[21:23.410 --> 21:25.570]  Then you've got 10 mothers to keep clones from.
[21:25.570 --> 21:28.290]  You can keep working with those, or however you may need it.
[21:28.290 --> 21:29.550]  Maybe you need one mother plant.
[21:29.550 --> 21:30.810]  Maybe you need two.
[21:30.810 --> 21:32.210]  Maybe you're looking for a male plant.
[21:32.210 --> 21:36.410]  You can do a pheno hunt with the male plant the exact same way.
[21:36.410 --> 21:39.690]  You've got to flower it out, compare it to other plants, see what it looks like, look
[21:39.690 --> 21:41.450]  for the traits you're looking for.
[21:41.450 --> 21:42.450]  Then you can find that plant.
[21:42.450 --> 21:48.450]  Of course, then you've got to do some pollen chucking, which is a whole other slew of podcast
[21:48.450 --> 21:49.450]  episodes.
[21:49.450 --> 21:50.450]  All right.
[21:50.450 --> 21:52.890]  I think I gave you the basics of a pheno hunt.
[21:52.890 --> 21:54.530]  Basically, run the seeds.
[21:54.530 --> 21:57.450]  Look for the one that rings your bell, not my bell.
[21:57.450 --> 21:58.450]  It's all about you.
[21:58.450 --> 22:00.170]  You've got to live with this plant.
[22:00.170 --> 22:01.170]  You've got to grow it.
[22:01.170 --> 22:02.170]  You've got to smoke it.
[22:02.170 --> 22:03.170]  You've got to enjoy it.
[22:03.170 --> 22:04.170]  You may have to sell it.
[22:04.170 --> 22:07.450]  So pick the one that works best for you, your patients, your clients, your market, your
[22:07.450 --> 22:09.710]  wallet, your grow space.
[22:09.710 --> 22:10.910]  Keep all of that stuff in mind.
[22:10.910 --> 22:13.630]  Are you going to run it indoors and outdoors?
[22:13.630 --> 22:14.750]  Think about that sort of stuff.
[22:14.750 --> 22:20.070]  If I have a clone, let's say I took 10 clones off of a plant and send it to 10 growers,
[22:20.070 --> 22:25.370]  you're all going to send me back 10 pictures with subtle variations because vapor pressure
[22:25.370 --> 22:29.950]  deficit differences, lighting differences, medium differences, nutrient differences,
[22:29.950 --> 22:34.290]  defoliation techniques, all of those things are going to make a difference in the phenotypical
[22:34.290 --> 22:36.310]  expression of these plants.
[22:36.310 --> 22:37.310]  So keep that in mind.
[22:37.310 --> 22:40.870]  If you're going to change anything in the grow, it may change a lot of stuff in the
[22:40.870 --> 22:42.470]  outcome of your plants.
[22:42.470 --> 22:43.470]  All right.
[22:43.470 --> 22:46.030]  I feel like I've rambled long enough about selecting a pheno hunt.
[22:46.030 --> 22:47.990]  Run the seeds, find your favorite, bro.
[22:47.990 --> 22:49.450]  It's a lot like dating.
[22:49.450 --> 22:53.430]  Then pick that favorite one, build a good relationship with it, dial it in, and grow
[22:53.430 --> 22:54.950]  it like a champion.
[22:54.950 --> 22:59.430]  Once you've got that one figured out, then unlike dating, then at that point, maybe you
[22:59.430 --> 23:02.390]  can move on and do another pheno hunt and find another plant.
[23:02.390 --> 23:04.910]  That way you've got some variety in the garden.
[23:04.910 --> 23:05.910]  All right.
[23:05.910 --> 23:08.310]  That's all I've got for you for this episode, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:08.310 --> 23:11.750]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, I would love to hear from you.
[23:11.750 --> 23:15.990]  My email address, of course, is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[23:15.990 --> 23:16.990]  Don't be shy.
[23:16.990 --> 23:19.030]  Send me your constructive criticism, your positive feedback.
[23:19.030 --> 23:20.510]  I do look forward to it.
[23:20.510 --> 23:26.550]  Also, make sure you support the show on Patreon at patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[23:26.550 --> 23:28.670]  Everything you need to know will be right there on the screen.
[23:28.670 --> 23:33.310]  If I said any of that too fast, all of the stuff you need is on my website, iRegenetics.com.
[23:34.310 --> 23:37.830]  There will be a link there to iRedirect where you can get the seeds.
[23:37.830 --> 23:41.110]  There's a link to the merch store so you can get hoodies, t-shirts.
[23:41.110 --> 23:42.750]  There are beanies up there.
[23:42.750 --> 23:44.590]  Lots of good shit on the merch store.
[23:44.590 --> 23:45.590]  Check it out.
[23:45.590 --> 23:46.590]  There's a link to the Discord, iRegenetics.com.
[23:46.590 --> 23:47.590]  All right.
[23:47.590 --> 23:51.230]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[23:51.230 --> 23:54.590]  I want to give a huge shout out to my buddy, Traveling With Tim.
[23:54.590 --> 23:57.990]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
