[00:00.000 --> 00:05.200]  Hey everyone, this is Dab and Granny, and you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.200 --> 00:16.000]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious shit.
[00:16.000 --> 00:17.600]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[00:17.600 --> 00:18.800]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:18.800 --> 00:20.560]  What we gonna do right here is go back.
[00:20.560 --> 00:21.760]  How far you going back?
[00:21.760 --> 00:22.240]  Way back.
[00:22.960 --> 00:24.880]  As we go a little something like this.
[00:25.600 --> 00:26.960]  Yo, what up podcast world?

[01:25.340 --> 01:27.100]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:27.100 --> 01:31.420]  It's time for episode number 112 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:31.420 --> 01:33.660]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:34.300 --> 01:34.700]  That's right.
[01:34.700 --> 01:38.460]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[01:39.020 --> 01:42.380]  If you're a cannabis activist, or even someone who's just curious about the current state
[01:42.380 --> 01:45.260]  of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:46.300 --> 01:46.940]  I'm your host.
[01:46.940 --> 01:48.140]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:48.140 --> 01:49.980]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:49.980 --> 01:53.340]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[01:53.340 --> 01:55.500]  band for letting me use their music on my show.
[01:55.500 --> 01:58.700]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:59.740 --> 02:01.980]  Right now, you guys are listening to a song called The Doggy Dub.
[02:01.980 --> 02:03.500]  It's off the album The Constant Struggle.
[02:03.500 --> 02:04.460]  Make sure you check that out.
[02:05.340 --> 02:08.780]  Also, this podcast is brought to you by our good friends at Hitman Glass.
[02:08.780 --> 02:11.420]  Hitman Glass, glass made in America by American.
[02:12.380 --> 02:15.260]  When I'm shopping for a new rig, I like to know that what I'm paying for is going to
[02:15.260 --> 02:18.540]  give me a nice fat dab, and I can always rely on Hitman Glass.
[02:18.540 --> 02:20.140]  You guys, don't trust your dab.
[02:20.140 --> 02:24.140]  Don't trust your dab to a rig made in China by a Chinese child without proper eye protection
[02:24.140 --> 02:28.300]  or adequate pay, probably barefoot, working all day with no wages.
[02:28.300 --> 02:32.460]  You guys, buy Hitman Glass, made in America by folks who dab as hard as you and I.
[02:32.780 --> 02:35.100]  Hitman Glass is not only a glass company.
[02:35.100 --> 02:37.900]  Hitman Duggee is a huge part of the cannabis and hash movement.
[02:37.900 --> 02:41.260]  Make sure you support Hitman Glass, and be sure to check out the Chalice Festival in
[02:41.260 --> 02:42.060]  California.
[02:42.060 --> 02:47.740]  Go to hitmanglass.com, and also search for Hitman Glass Duggee on Instagram.
[02:47.740 --> 02:48.540]  Give them a follow.
[02:49.820 --> 02:52.220]  Sorry, guys, I'm coughing through the intro because I'm already sitting here hitting my
[02:52.220 --> 02:54.060]  Hitman E-Series sidecar.
[02:54.060 --> 02:57.980]  This is my first Hitman rig, and I've been impressed since my first rip out of this bad
[02:57.980 --> 02:58.460]  dog.
[02:58.460 --> 03:01.500]  I picked this up at Illusion's Glass Gallery about five years ago.
[03:02.060 --> 03:03.980]  This has been my go-to rig all the time.
[03:03.980 --> 03:05.100]  It's sitting right here in front of me.
[03:05.100 --> 03:09.020]  Right now, I've got the, let's see, it's got the white Hitman logo on the side.
[03:09.020 --> 03:14.380]  It's got the Black Flame logo up the stem piece where the nail goes, and it's got a
[03:14.380 --> 03:15.660]  big fat base on it.
[03:15.660 --> 03:20.540]  It's got the E-Series perk, so the perk has the letter E in it four times, and it's got
[03:20.540 --> 03:24.220]  a Hitman highly educated duality nail on it.
[03:24.220 --> 03:25.420]  That is my go-to rig.
[03:25.420 --> 03:27.660]  That's probably my favorite rig in the whole collection.
[03:28.220 --> 03:31.100]  Until the new rig arrives, we will talk about that one when it gets here.
[03:31.180 --> 03:32.220]  Big shout out to Hitman Glass.
[03:32.220 --> 03:33.740]  You guys, make sure you support Hitman Glass.
[03:33.740 --> 03:38.380]  If you're looking for a new rig, go to hitmanglass.com and check it out.
[03:38.380 --> 03:41.180]  Let them know that Ross and Jeff from the Grow From Your Heart podcast sent you.
[03:42.460 --> 03:43.900]  Mystic Roots, that was good timing.
[03:43.900 --> 03:45.580]  Big shout out to the Mystic Roots crew.
[03:45.580 --> 03:47.500]  You guys, I am recording on Christmas Eve.
[03:47.500 --> 03:49.580]  By the time this comes out, Christmas will have happened.
[03:49.580 --> 03:51.500]  I hope you guys all had a wonderful Christmas.
[03:51.500 --> 03:53.340]  I hope you got the gifts you wanted.
[03:53.340 --> 03:55.420]  I hope you gave a bunch of wonderful gifts.
[03:55.420 --> 03:58.380]  I hope you got to see people smile at the gifts that you gave them.
[03:59.180 --> 04:02.700]  This is also the last episode for the year 2015.
[04:02.700 --> 04:05.820]  When I come back, it will be the year 2016.
[04:05.820 --> 04:11.580]  I'm going to put together a checklist of things that you guys should be doing monthly,
[04:12.380 --> 04:13.900]  daily, weekly, monthly.
[04:13.900 --> 04:17.260]  We'll put together a checklist of things that you guys should be handling in your gardens.
[04:17.260 --> 04:21.820]  I'll get that out to you at the beginning of the year so that you can start getting on top of that.
[04:21.820 --> 04:25.180]  I'm sure you're already on top of your garden, but I'm sure also there's some shit that you
[04:25.180 --> 04:25.740]  are missing.
[04:25.740 --> 04:27.100]  Sometimes we need a reminder.
[04:27.100 --> 04:29.580]  I make myself a bunch of ridiculous little notes.
[04:29.580 --> 04:31.820]  Try to remind myself of things that need to get done.
[04:31.820 --> 04:33.740]  I'm going to try to make a list for you guys.
[04:33.740 --> 04:34.140]  All right.
[04:34.140 --> 04:34.780]  I'm rambling.
[04:34.780 --> 04:38.220]  I'm going to turn down this music a little bit, and we will get into the show.
[04:39.820 --> 04:41.100]  Merry Christmas, everybody.
[04:41.100 --> 04:42.140]  I'm stoked for Christmas.
[04:42.700 --> 04:43.500]  I'm feeling the vibe.
[04:43.500 --> 04:44.700]  I wasn't feeling the Christmas vibe.
[04:44.700 --> 04:45.500]  I've been working too much.
[04:45.500 --> 04:45.980]  I've been busy.
[04:45.980 --> 04:48.540]  I've been on the go, but I finally got all my Christmas shopping done.
[04:48.540 --> 04:49.980]  I got caught up, so I'm feeling the vibe.
[04:49.980 --> 04:51.020]  I'm in a good mood.
[04:51.020 --> 04:51.980]  Having a good day.
[04:51.980 --> 04:54.060]  I've been sitting here taking dabs, getting the show prepared.
[04:54.700 --> 04:55.660]  Let's get into it.
[04:55.660 --> 05:00.060]  I know you guys would prefer grow lessons, but it's been a busy couple of weeks.
[05:00.060 --> 05:04.060]  Then I saw this news article, so there's going to be a little bit of news on this episode.
[05:04.620 --> 05:09.180]  Then I am going to talk about how I got into the cannabis industry.
[05:09.740 --> 05:12.860]  I was hanging out with a few friends that have known me for quite a while, and they're like,
[05:12.860 --> 05:14.380]  dude, how did you even get into this?
[05:14.380 --> 05:17.900]  I was like, well, that's a podcast topic, so let me just say it into a microphone, and
[05:17.900 --> 05:19.420]  then you guys can listen to the show.
[05:19.420 --> 05:21.420]  I'll talk about that in a couple of minutes.
[05:21.420 --> 05:25.340]  Before I get to the news article, before I get to talking about how I got into the industry,
[05:25.900 --> 05:27.820]  I want to give a little bit of advice.
[05:27.820 --> 05:30.380]  A friend asked me about foliar spray.
[05:30.380 --> 05:35.340]  He's actually applying silver thiosulfate to his plants so that he can reverse his females
[05:35.340 --> 05:38.620]  into males and make feminized seeds.
[05:38.620 --> 05:43.500]  He asked me one question about foliar spray that I thought I should help you guys out
[05:43.500 --> 05:44.300]  with a little bit.
[05:44.940 --> 05:49.020]  When you were spraying your plants, whether it be foliar spray, whether it be pesticides,
[05:49.020 --> 05:54.300]  whether it be silver thiosulfate to try to make male plants out of them, however you
[05:54.300 --> 05:58.620]  are spraying them, I highly suggest that you either spray right when the lights go
[05:58.620 --> 06:01.340]  off or that you turn the lights off while you spray.
[06:01.980 --> 06:05.820]  There are a couple of reasons for this, but my main reason for this is that you don't
[06:05.820 --> 06:10.060]  want to spray your plants when you've got big, heavy, high-intensity discharge lights
[06:10.060 --> 06:13.340]  right above them because you're going to spray little bubbles all over your plants.
[06:13.340 --> 06:16.620]  You're going to put this layer of bubbles that's basically a bunch of bubbles all over
[06:16.620 --> 06:17.180]  your plants.
[06:17.180 --> 06:20.540]  You want a nice, fine mist when you spray, so you're going to have bubbles all over your
[06:20.540 --> 06:20.780]  plants.
[06:20.780 --> 06:24.940]  Plants are going to be soaked, and these high-intensity discharge lights are going to shine down onto
[06:24.940 --> 06:28.300]  those bubbles, and it's going to work like a magnifying glass.
[06:28.300 --> 06:31.340]  Remember when you were a little kid and you used to roast ants with a magnifying glass?
[06:31.900 --> 06:34.780]  I know, not everybody did that, but a lot of the boys are nodding their head going,
[06:34.780 --> 06:35.820]  yeah, we did that.
[06:35.820 --> 06:37.500]  Well, you're going to do the same thing to your plant.
[06:38.620 --> 06:42.060]  The lights are going to act like the sun, the bubble is going to act like the magnifying
[06:42.060 --> 06:44.780]  glass, and your leaf is going to get little white burn dots on it.
[06:44.780 --> 06:46.540]  You're going to be really confused as to what it's from.
[06:46.540 --> 06:47.580]  You're going to think a bug ate it.
[06:47.580 --> 06:49.340]  You're going to think you have a deficiency.
[06:49.340 --> 06:52.540]  You're going to think something's messed up, but honestly, what happened was you foliar
[06:52.540 --> 06:55.740]  sprayed and the light made a little bubble on there, and it burned the shit out of your
[06:55.740 --> 06:56.060]  plants.
[06:56.060 --> 07:00.620]  So I highly recommend either removing the plants from the light, turning off the light,
[07:00.620 --> 07:02.140]  or waiting until the light clicks off.
[07:02.140 --> 07:05.420]  Right when that light clicks off, if you've got a small crop, you should be able to get
[07:05.420 --> 07:08.860]  in there, and you should be able to spray that entire crop in just a couple of minutes,
[07:08.860 --> 07:11.820]  and your plants won't even notice that you kept them up for a couple of extra minutes.
[07:11.820 --> 07:15.340]  That way, you're not going to get any burns on your plants from the light, and then you're
[07:15.340 --> 07:18.780]  not interrupting your photo period, and your plants are going to get all of the light that
[07:18.780 --> 07:20.540]  they should have gotten throughout the day cycle.
[07:20.540 --> 07:24.220]  So I recommend spraying right as the lights go off, or if you need to, turn the lights
[07:24.220 --> 07:27.100]  off, or if you must, just remove the plants.
[07:27.100 --> 07:31.820]  If you're only going to spray one or two plants, like my friend Fred is trying to reverse a
[07:31.820 --> 07:35.900]  female plant into a male by spraying it with silver thiosulfate, and I would just take
[07:35.900 --> 07:37.180]  that plant into another room.
[07:37.980 --> 07:40.140]  I would almost take that plant to another part of the house.
[07:40.140 --> 07:44.780]  If it's a home grow, I would go out to the garage and spray it out there, because that
[07:44.860 --> 07:49.660]  way you will not get any of that silver thiosulfate on the plants that you want to remain female.
[07:50.300 --> 07:52.220]  So that's my guidance on that.
[07:52.220 --> 07:57.020]  Also, Fred, let that plant that you sprayed dry before you return it to the grow room
[07:57.020 --> 08:01.660]  with the females, because you don't want to spread that liquid dripping silver thiosulfate
[08:01.660 --> 08:03.340]  onto any of the other plants.
[08:03.340 --> 08:06.860]  All right, so that's my guidance on foliar spray or pesticide application.
[08:07.500 --> 08:10.620]  Mainly, don't do it with the lights on, because you don't want to burn the shit out of the
[08:10.620 --> 08:11.100]  plants.
[08:11.740 --> 08:14.220]  All right, now I've got a news article that I'd like to share with you.
[08:14.220 --> 08:19.260]  This one comes from the Westward, and this article was written by Thomas Mitchell.
[08:19.260 --> 08:21.500]  Make sure you guys check out westward.com.
[08:21.500 --> 08:23.340]  The Westward is a Denver newspaper.
[08:23.340 --> 08:25.260]  Like, every town has their little local newspaper.
[08:25.260 --> 08:29.660]  The Westward is their little local, like, alternative magazine, newspaper type of thing.
[08:29.660 --> 08:31.500]  Make sure you check that out if you're ever in Denver.
[08:31.500 --> 08:32.860]  It's a great publication.
[08:32.860 --> 08:35.820]  If you ever want to know where all the cool shows are, where the good food is, whatever
[08:35.820 --> 08:39.020]  is going on, that's the article or the magazine to check out.
[08:39.020 --> 08:41.420]  All right, the Westward article goes like this.
[08:41.420 --> 08:43.020]  Something's going on in Pueblo County.
[08:43.020 --> 08:45.820]  You might not notice as you drive through the town, which took a big hit during the
[08:45.820 --> 08:49.420]  steel recession of the 80s and has slowly been coming back, but your nostrils should
[08:49.420 --> 08:52.780]  get a clue once you reach the outskirts where the aroma of cannabis hits you.
[08:53.420 --> 08:57.900]  Although this isn't an unusual odor in Colorado these days, the pot industry is in full bloom
[08:57.900 --> 08:59.740]  in the county surrounding Pueblo.
[08:59.740 --> 09:03.020]  I wish I could write my high school guidance counselor a letter about this, says Michael
[09:03.020 --> 09:07.420]  Cadwell, director of sales for the Los Sueños Cannabis Farm, as he sniffs a bud the size
[09:07.420 --> 09:08.540]  of a football.
[09:08.540 --> 09:10.060]  This is the way we do it, he says.
[09:11.180 --> 09:12.300]  Excuse my coughing, you guys.
[09:12.300 --> 09:13.660]  I was taking some dabs earlier.
[09:14.380 --> 09:18.620]  Los Sueños is a 36-acre farm just outside the city in Pueblo County.
[09:18.620 --> 09:21.100]  It's one of the largest outdoor grows in the country.
[09:21.100 --> 09:25.420]  Unlike Denver County, this one does not require that commercial cannabis cultivation be confined
[09:25.420 --> 09:30.300]  inside, and a stroll through the four fields planted with 55 strains shows what a difference
[09:30.300 --> 09:32.220]  the bright Southern Colorado sun makes.
[09:32.780 --> 09:36.860]  Plants here grow much taller and heavier, and they need to be tied to stakes just to
[09:36.860 --> 09:37.820]  stay upright.
[09:37.820 --> 09:43.660]  The high elevation increase and increase in ultraviolet rays tricks the plant into higher
[09:43.660 --> 09:49.740]  resin production, explains Aaron Hovey, head grower at Los Sueños, and the natural sunlight
[09:49.740 --> 09:51.740]  is virtually year-round, he says.
[09:51.740 --> 09:57.020]  Still, the area can get cold, so when the winter frost hits Los Sueños and outdoor
[09:57.020 --> 10:02.460]  growing becomes unfeasible, Hovey and his team operate in four greenhouses, a more eco-friendly
[10:02.460 --> 10:05.260]  alternative to the light bulb warehouse setups in Denver.
[10:05.260 --> 10:09.020]  You can have a thousand lights in some huge warehouse for massive production, but that's
[10:09.020 --> 10:11.660]  not what we're trying to do down here, Hovey says.
[10:11.660 --> 10:13.100]  This is farming cannabis.
[10:13.740 --> 10:17.900]  Hovey grew up in North Carolina, where he started growing marijuana outdoors as a teenager.
[10:17.900 --> 10:21.420]  Despite the objections of his parents and local law enforcement, he honed his craft
[10:22.300 --> 10:29.340]  there before finding a legal haven in Pueblo County, where he now nurtures the lives of
[10:29.340 --> 10:31.660]  more than 10,000 marijuana plants.
[10:31.740 --> 10:35.340]  There's no playbook to growing pot like this, and there are no guarantees with growing in
[10:35.340 --> 10:38.540]  the natural elements, but that's what makes it fun, Hovey says.
[10:38.540 --> 10:41.180]  You can't be successful at this without good help.
[10:41.180 --> 10:44.540]  When the hail and mold hits, you need people who know what they are doing.
[10:45.900 --> 10:50.300]  Hovey is just one of many Coloradans who moved to Pueblo to work with the legal marijuana,
[10:50.300 --> 10:52.540]  but locals are getting in on the action too.
[10:52.540 --> 10:57.660]  More than 1,300 jobs were created in Pueblo County in 2014 by the marijuana industry,
[10:57.660 --> 11:01.660]  according to a study by the Southern Colorado Growers Association,
[11:01.660 --> 11:06.060]  a staffing firm that helps people land marijuana jobs, opened in Pueblo last February.
[11:06.780 --> 11:11.900]  At the same time, industrial vacancies decreased by more than 15%, and marijuana-related businesses
[11:11.900 --> 11:16.860]  accounted for 36% of new commercial building projects in Pueblo County in 2014,
[11:16.860 --> 11:19.740]  according to the Pueblo County Regional Building Department.
[11:19.740 --> 11:23.980]  Folks are quickly realizing that the cost of cultivation is a lot less in greenhouses
[11:23.980 --> 11:28.460]  and outdoors, says Pueblo County Commissioner Sal Pace, who has championed the marijuana
[11:28.460 --> 11:31.180]  industry as a form of economic growth in the area.
[11:31.180 --> 11:35.980]  We have a very sizable rural agrarian portion here.
[11:35.980 --> 11:39.180]  Sorry, I've never read that word before, and I probably should have.
[11:39.180 --> 11:42.780]  When Coloradans voted to legalize the growing and selling of recreational marijuana,
[11:42.780 --> 11:46.700]  they also agreed to allow towns and counties to choose whether or not to allow retail pot
[11:46.700 --> 11:48.460]  businesses within their boundaries.
[11:48.460 --> 11:53.900]  Denver, already the state epicenter of medical marijuana, quickly became the first retail
[11:53.900 --> 11:57.420]  marijuana capital of the world, while much of the rest of the state struggled over the
[11:57.420 --> 12:01.820]  decision of whether to accept pot businesses, and if so, how to regulate them.
[12:01.820 --> 12:05.980]  But Pace and his fellow commissioners were keen on the idea of an agricultural marijuana
[12:05.980 --> 12:11.900]  economy early on, and began issuing cultivation licenses in 2014 in hopes of spurring local
[12:11.900 --> 12:12.780]  industry.
[12:12.780 --> 12:17.980]  There are now cultivation licenses for 33 medical operations and 57 recreational operations
[12:17.980 --> 12:19.740]  in Pueblo and Pueblo West County.
[12:20.540 --> 12:23.820]  Let me clarify for people that are not from Colorado, and there was a couple of things
[12:23.820 --> 12:25.260]  in that sentence I want to clarify.
[12:25.260 --> 12:30.460]  It says there are now cultivation licenses for 33 medical operations and 57 recreational
[12:30.460 --> 12:31.260]  operations.
[12:32.620 --> 12:36.780]  Recreational and medical are grown in completely different areas.
[12:37.660 --> 12:42.940]  So if a grow applies to be a legalized grow with the MED, the Marijuana Enforcement Division,
[12:42.940 --> 12:46.220]  they either apply to be a medical grow or a recreational grow.
[12:47.180 --> 12:50.220]  And it's just the difference in licensing.
[12:50.220 --> 12:52.060]  It's how your plant count adds up.
[12:52.060 --> 12:53.980]  It's how your cannabis is handled.
[12:53.980 --> 13:01.740]  So if the cannabis is grown in a medical facility, it can only be sold to medical retail
[13:01.740 --> 13:02.540]  facilities.
[13:02.540 --> 13:08.380]  If the cannabis is grown in a recreational facility, it can only be sold in a recreational
[13:08.380 --> 13:09.980]  retail establishment.
[13:09.980 --> 13:14.220]  So that's why they make the indication there if it's a recreational or a medical marijuana
[13:14.220 --> 13:14.940]  facility.
[13:15.820 --> 13:18.780]  And also they talk about Pueblo and Pueblo West County.
[13:19.340 --> 13:21.500]  Those are on the border of each other.
[13:21.500 --> 13:26.700]  And there are a bunch, I think there are 14 or 15 dispensaries in Pueblo West, which is
[13:26.700 --> 13:30.220]  just a small, short, quick drive from the city of Pueblo.
[13:30.220 --> 13:33.820]  I actually worked in Pueblo West, and I live in the south side of Pueblo.
[13:33.820 --> 13:35.820]  And it used to take me just 15 or 20 minutes to get there.
[13:35.820 --> 13:37.900]  So it's not like it's a distance.
[13:37.900 --> 13:42.140]  And the city of Pueblo does not allow any cannabis sales within city limits.
[13:42.140 --> 13:45.980]  So everything that is sold is just in Pueblo County and Pueblo West.
[13:46.540 --> 13:47.820]  All right, I've gotten off on a tangent.
[13:47.820 --> 13:49.100]  Let's get back to the article.
[13:49.100 --> 13:53.340]  It says, although the city of Pueblo allows cultivation, it's been more guarded in its
[13:53.340 --> 13:54.620]  approach to sales.
[13:54.620 --> 13:59.100]  Recreational pot shops are still under a moratorium in the city until a public vote on the matter
[13:59.100 --> 14:01.100]  in November of 2016.
[14:01.100 --> 14:05.500]  So residents need to purchase their pot at one of the 13 recreational shops in Pueblo
[14:05.500 --> 14:08.060]  County where retail sales are legal.
[14:08.060 --> 14:11.580]  The Pueblo City Council is starting to come around on the medical side, however, and the
[14:11.580 --> 14:15.980]  first MMJ dispensary within Pueblo city limits opened in October.
[14:15.980 --> 14:20.060]  Pueblo natives Steven and Monique Duran, who've been together for 13 years, started looking
[14:20.060 --> 14:22.780]  into medical marijuana businesses several years ago.
[14:22.780 --> 14:26.860]  He started studying medical marijuana after his shift at the Comanche Power Plant, while
[14:26.860 --> 14:30.060]  Monique became a regulatory rules whiz.
[14:30.620 --> 14:35.900]  Finally, after finding one of the rare buildings in Pueblo that met all of the city's stringent
[14:35.900 --> 14:40.460]  zoning requirements for the marijuana operation, which include the location and a small council
[14:40.460 --> 14:44.940]  approved industrial zone, the Duran's poured their savings into a lease for the building,
[14:44.940 --> 14:47.660]  which is now the 719 MMJ dispensary.
[14:48.620 --> 14:52.220]  There was a map the city had for us in order to meet the requirements, and it was very,
[14:52.220 --> 14:53.180]  very limited.
[14:53.180 --> 14:55.900]  We found this place, which met all of them, Monique says.
[14:55.900 --> 14:58.540]  Right now, it's us and one employee running the store.
[14:58.540 --> 15:02.140]  We're just a couple, but we want to be the model for how to properly medicate patients
[15:02.140 --> 15:03.020]  in Pueblo.
[15:03.020 --> 15:07.260]  There won't be many competitors following that model, though, since zoning maps, the
[15:07.260 --> 15:10.780]  zoning map is so restrictive that only a few more medical dispensaries might manage
[15:10.780 --> 15:12.620]  to find a suitable spot within the city.
[15:13.340 --> 15:17.420]  The couple's inspiration for 719 came from watching Steven's sister struggle through
[15:17.420 --> 15:22.300]  the difficulties of multiple sclerosis and seeing how pharmaceutical marijuana medication
[15:22.300 --> 15:23.260]  affected her.
[15:23.260 --> 15:27.260]  This was just a different person on the, she was just a different person on those meds,
[15:27.260 --> 15:28.300]  says Steven.
[15:28.300 --> 15:32.140]  Seeing what real patients have to fight through was some strong motivation.
[15:32.140 --> 15:35.980]  Now, these homegrown owners are happy with what they've created, just coming in the shop
[15:35.980 --> 15:39.340]  and looking around as two kids from Pueblo who never really had much.
[15:39.340 --> 15:41.500]  Sometimes it's like a dream, Monique says.
[15:41.500 --> 15:45.340]  It's such a cool story, and we hope to make it a better one.
[15:45.340 --> 15:47.180]  It's a big shout out to Pueblo, Colorado.
[15:47.740 --> 15:50.220]  Several years ago, like the article said, this town was falling apart.
[15:50.220 --> 15:53.580]  When I used to tell people that I'm from Pueblo, Colorado, they would laugh at me.
[15:53.580 --> 15:55.180]  They would not take me seriously.
[15:55.900 --> 16:00.060]  Now, when I'm in Denver or Colorado Springs, and I say that I am from Pueblo, a lot of
[16:00.060 --> 16:02.940]  people are like, oh, you got a lot of weed going on down there, don't you?
[16:03.420 --> 16:07.340]  We're starting to get a little bit of respect in the cannabis industry.
[16:07.340 --> 16:08.460]  Big shout out to The Westward.
[16:08.460 --> 16:10.300]  Thanks for publishing an article about us.
[16:10.300 --> 16:11.740]  I hope you guys enjoyed it.
[16:11.740 --> 16:15.180]  You guys, I need to take a drink, and then I will be right back to talk a little bit
[16:15.180 --> 16:17.660]  about how I got into the cannabis industry.
[16:17.660 --> 16:18.160]  Hang tight.
[16:43.520 --> 16:44.560]  All right, you guys, I am back.
[16:44.560 --> 16:48.640]  I took a drink as promised, and as any good dabber would do, I took a couple of fat dabs
[16:48.640 --> 16:51.680]  while I was off the mic, spared you the coughing into the microphone.
[16:52.400 --> 16:54.400]  What I was dabbing, I want to share this with you.
[16:54.400 --> 16:55.200]  I was dabbing.
[16:55.200 --> 16:55.920]  Where's the package?
[16:55.920 --> 16:56.320]  Here we go.
[16:56.320 --> 16:58.080]  I've got a little bit of LA Kush.
[16:58.800 --> 17:04.640]  It's LA Confidential crossed to some OG Kush, but this is PHO Wax.
[17:04.640 --> 17:06.800]  Most of the time I'm smoking BHO.
[17:06.800 --> 17:11.600]  Most of the shatter and dabs that you see available on the market right now are made
[17:11.600 --> 17:12.320]  with butane.
[17:12.960 --> 17:14.960]  This hash was made with propane.
[17:15.760 --> 17:18.800]  Let me open up some shatter that was made with butane so that I can compare them side
[17:18.800 --> 17:22.240]  by side and give you a little better description of what I'm working with here.
[17:22.240 --> 17:24.480]  So the shatter, most of you guys are familiar with shatter.
[17:25.200 --> 17:31.680]  Shatter is an ambery colored, sort of a honey colored slab of shatter.
[17:31.680 --> 17:37.280]  It's a little thin sheet of real, if I bend it, it cracks.
[17:37.280 --> 17:40.000]  Like it'll just pop off and some of it will chip off and go flying away.
[17:40.640 --> 17:45.280]  When you're watching Jurassic Park, all those big slabs of like the amber resin that the
[17:45.280 --> 17:49.040]  bugs are kept in, that the bugs are stuck in, that is what shatter looks like in my
[17:49.040 --> 17:49.440]  opinion.
[17:49.440 --> 17:51.280]  I think that stuff looks like shatter.
[17:51.280 --> 17:54.880]  So compared to the shatter, I'm going to open up this BHO and take a look.
[17:55.680 --> 17:57.200]  This is propane honey oil.
[17:57.760 --> 18:02.000]  It looks like, and it looks like a piece of soap.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.760]  It's really lightly colored.
[18:03.760 --> 18:08.800]  It almost resembles, since it's holiday time, this looks like a small piece of Amanda's
[18:08.800 --> 18:09.760]  peanut butter fudge.
[18:10.320 --> 18:14.160]  Yeah, if somebody cut Amanda's peanut butter fudge perfectly smooth, I think it would look
[18:14.160 --> 18:15.120]  just like this stuff.
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.360]  I just noticed that there was a kind of a shitty technical difficulty with my microphone,
[18:19.360 --> 18:22.080]  so I apologize if part of the show was subpar quality.
[18:22.080 --> 18:23.200]  That is not my style.
[18:23.200 --> 18:26.880]  I'll do my best to fix it, but I just noticed that there wasn't something working properly.
[18:26.880 --> 18:28.480]  So shout out to the failed cable.
[18:28.480 --> 18:30.720]  Pretty sure it's just an XLR cable that needs to be replaced.
[18:30.720 --> 18:31.600]  Not a big deal.
[18:31.600 --> 18:33.040]  Anyway, I was talking about this hash.
[18:33.040 --> 18:34.800]  I'm picking some of it up right now.
[18:35.440 --> 18:39.680]  This is much easier to handle and deal with and work with than shatter.
[18:39.680 --> 18:40.800]  Shatter is real sticky.
[18:40.800 --> 18:41.840]  It'll stick to your fingers.
[18:42.400 --> 18:43.680]  When you break it, it'll break off.
[18:43.680 --> 18:45.920]  When your fingers heat it up, it gets kind of goopy.
[18:45.920 --> 18:50.960]  I'm holding onto this PHO, and I am able to break off little dabs for myself.
[18:50.960 --> 18:54.960]  I'm able to break off big ass dabs for myself and little dabs for my friends.
[18:54.960 --> 18:56.320]  It's much easier to handle.
[18:56.320 --> 18:57.920]  I just took a few dabs of it.
[18:57.920 --> 19:03.200]  One thing that I can really say, this stuff is flavorful.
[19:03.200 --> 19:06.800]  It's got a really sweet, really dank flavor to it.
[19:06.800 --> 19:09.120]  I can't even properly describe the flavor of it.
[19:09.120 --> 19:10.640]  It's got a cushy flavor to it.
[19:10.640 --> 19:11.440]  It tastes...
[19:11.440 --> 19:14.560]  The essence of cannabis is really in the PHO.
[19:14.560 --> 19:18.880]  I was skeptical at first, but a friend of mine that works at a dispensary,
[19:18.880 --> 19:20.880]  she convinced me that I wanted to try some of it.
[19:20.880 --> 19:22.960]  I grabbed myself a gram, and you know what?
[19:22.960 --> 19:23.520]  I approve.
[19:24.560 --> 19:26.080]  Let me give a shout out to the company here.
[19:26.080 --> 19:30.000]  I don't usually do this because I am affiliated with another facility,
[19:30.000 --> 19:36.720]  but I am going to give a huge shout out to the Kraft Concentrates for their LA Kush PHO Wax.
[19:36.720 --> 19:38.320]  This stuff is tasty, and I do approve.
[19:39.200 --> 19:42.480]  A big shout out to my friend Jessica for convincing me to pick up a gram.
[19:42.480 --> 19:43.040]  What up, Jess?
[19:43.040 --> 19:44.960]  I appreciate the recommendation.
[19:44.960 --> 19:46.080]  Good shit.
[19:46.080 --> 19:48.160]  Everybody, buy some, take dabs of it.
[19:48.160 --> 19:48.800]  I love it.
[19:48.800 --> 19:49.040]  All right.
[19:49.040 --> 19:53.200]  So I said I was going to come back and choke into the microphone a whole bunch.
[19:53.200 --> 19:53.680]  Oh my gosh.
[19:53.680 --> 19:54.160]  I'm so sorry.
[19:54.160 --> 19:54.960]  That was gross.
[19:54.960 --> 19:57.440]  Anyway, I said I was going to come back and talk a little bit
[19:57.440 --> 20:01.120]  about how I got myself into the cannabis industry.
[20:01.120 --> 20:02.000]  Let me get into that.
[20:02.880 --> 20:03.360]  I'm grabbing...
[20:03.360 --> 20:04.640]  I wrote a couple of little notes here.
[20:04.640 --> 20:05.200]  Nothing major.
[20:05.200 --> 20:07.600]  I just took a couple of little bullet points while I was dabbing.
[20:07.600 --> 20:10.000]  So I wanted to say that I was in the cannabis industry
[20:10.800 --> 20:13.600]  illegally before the cannabis industry ever existed, you guys.
[20:15.360 --> 20:18.800]  I don't know how much of this I should talk about or admit, but we're beyond that, right?
[20:18.800 --> 20:23.440]  The statute of limitations is probably gone, if I admit to any criminal activity.
[20:23.440 --> 20:27.360]  Anyway, when I moved here from California, I was going to high school here,
[20:27.360 --> 20:32.240]  and our little crew was on a camping trip, and somebody pulled out a pipe, and we started smoking.
[20:32.240 --> 20:36.640]  And I was like, nice, some weed, because I hadn't seen weed since I'd left California.
[20:36.640 --> 20:38.160]  So we got stoned.
[20:38.160 --> 20:40.560]  And then I was like, all right, all my friends smoke weed.
[20:40.560 --> 20:42.320]  That means we're going to have to find somewhere to buy weed.
[20:42.320 --> 20:44.480]  None of our crew really had a weed guy yet.
[20:44.480 --> 20:47.520]  And I knew that a couple of the guys at school were hustling weed,
[20:47.520 --> 20:48.800]  but they didn't really...
[20:48.800 --> 20:50.400]  There were some racial tensions there.
[20:50.400 --> 20:54.960]  At my school back in that time, the Mexican guys hung out with the Mexican guys,
[20:54.960 --> 20:56.560]  and the white guys hung out with the white guys.
[20:56.560 --> 20:57.760]  And we didn't fight or anything.
[20:57.760 --> 21:00.000]  It's just kind of what those groups did.
[21:01.920 --> 21:03.200]  There was no reason for us to mix.
[21:03.200 --> 21:06.000]  We were over here listening to Green Day and Nirvana and Phish,
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.760]  and they were over there listening to, I don't even know,
[21:08.560 --> 21:11.120]  Cypress Hill is one of the things I remember they listened to a whole bunch of.
[21:11.120 --> 21:16.480]  But anyway, I was brave enough to hit up one of the Mexican guys that I knew sold weed.
[21:16.480 --> 21:18.320]  I was like, hey, think you'd sell me some weed?
[21:18.320 --> 21:21.920]  And he was kind of leery about it at first, but he's like, yep, you have to buy ounces.
[21:21.920 --> 21:23.920]  And at that time, we were just high school kids,
[21:23.920 --> 21:25.520]  so an ounce was a little bit of a stretch.
[21:25.520 --> 21:26.880]  So I made it happen.
[21:26.880 --> 21:30.240]  I bought an ounce, and I started hustling a little bit of that herb to my friends.
[21:30.240 --> 21:34.000]  And then those guys were heavily connected.
[21:34.000 --> 21:35.360]  And they were like, you're moving ounces.
[21:35.360 --> 21:36.560]  You're going to start moving pounds now.
[21:36.560 --> 21:39.200]  And they started throwing me pounds for dirty, dirty cheap around here.
[21:39.200 --> 21:42.400]  In this town, I had the cheapest hookup on pounds around here for a while.
[21:43.600 --> 21:46.400]  Until one day, I was selling a pound on the east side of town,
[21:47.200 --> 21:51.760]  and a couple of guys with face tattoos and assault rifles walked up to my car,
[21:51.760 --> 21:53.360]  and they did not take my shit from me.
[21:53.360 --> 21:54.160]  I was so amazed.
[21:54.160 --> 21:58.080]  But they told me that I was not allowed to be selling my product on that side of town,
[21:58.080 --> 22:01.200]  that I was able to sell my product on the north and south ends of town,
[22:01.200 --> 22:03.200]  but don't fuck with the east and west side.
[22:03.200 --> 22:05.680]  And if they see me again, they're going to take all my shit from me.
[22:05.680 --> 22:06.800]  And they sent me home nicely.
[22:07.440 --> 22:09.920]  So I kind of just became the street dude.
[22:09.920 --> 22:12.400]  I hustled the brickweed, the Mexican brickweed,
[22:12.400 --> 22:14.640]  from a couple of friends that were just flooding it to me.
[22:14.640 --> 22:17.040]  So since none of the other white guys in my neighborhood
[22:17.040 --> 22:18.720]  wanted to talk to these Mexican guys,
[22:18.720 --> 22:20.560]  I was just getting pounds from the Mexican guys
[22:20.560 --> 22:22.480]  and just selling it to all my gringo friends,
[22:22.480 --> 22:23.600]  and it was working out for me.
[22:23.600 --> 22:25.840]  So that's kind of where I made my break into the weed scene.
[22:25.840 --> 22:27.040]  That's how I learned how to hustle.
[22:28.880 --> 22:30.640]  All of that is a fictional tale.
[22:30.640 --> 22:32.640]  If you were involved in any sort of law enforcement,
[22:32.640 --> 22:33.440]  I just made that up.
[22:33.440 --> 22:36.640]  I'm writing a book, and that is all going to be in the fictional book I'm writing.
[22:36.640 --> 22:37.840]  All right. So how's that feel?
[22:37.840 --> 22:40.000]  All right. So then, let's see.
[22:40.720 --> 22:42.560]  I'm smoking and hustling and doing my thing.
[22:42.560 --> 22:45.440]  Several years go by, and then I learned how to grow.
[22:45.440 --> 22:46.640]  Actually, I learned how to grow.
[22:49.520 --> 22:52.000]  I had a guy that lived in the same apartment building as me
[22:52.000 --> 22:53.280]  when I was like seven years old.
[22:53.920 --> 22:55.680]  And that guy was growing weed in his backyard.
[22:55.680 --> 22:57.760]  And I would listen to his conversations
[22:58.720 --> 23:02.000]  between my friend Wayne and my uncle Eric and this dude.
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.680]  And they would talk about how to grow weed.
[23:03.680 --> 23:06.640]  And I was like somewhere between seven and 10 years old when I lived there.
[23:06.640 --> 23:09.520]  And I absorbed so much information from that conversation
[23:09.520 --> 23:12.160]  that I felt like I was destined to grow weed at some point in time.
[23:12.720 --> 23:15.520]  So we jumped way forward into the early 2000s.
[23:15.520 --> 23:16.960]  I couldn't even tell you exactly which year.
[23:17.520 --> 23:22.800]  A friend of mine was growing some weed in Colorado, and he needed a hand.
[23:22.800 --> 23:23.920]  And so I went and helped him out.
[23:23.920 --> 23:27.360]  He didn't let me do a whole bunch, but he exposed me to some things.
[23:27.920 --> 23:29.200]  And so I learned how to do that.
[23:29.920 --> 23:31.040]  And I got good at that.
[23:31.040 --> 23:33.040]  And then I moved to Lawrence, Kansas.
[23:33.040 --> 23:35.440]  That's just for unrelated reasons, for musical reasons.
[23:35.440 --> 23:38.160]  I chased a band, chased the dream of being in a band,
[23:38.160 --> 23:40.320]  and went and played in Lawrence, Kansas for several years,
[23:40.320 --> 23:41.280]  traveled around the Midwest.
[23:41.280 --> 23:46.080]  But anyway, a friend of mine there had a place where we would play music.
[23:46.080 --> 23:49.360]  And one day I was playing the drums, and I looked up.
[23:49.360 --> 23:50.160]  I don't know why I looked up.
[23:50.160 --> 23:51.520]  When you're playing the drums, your eyes just wander.
[23:51.520 --> 23:52.880]  Your eyes just go places.
[23:52.880 --> 23:54.720]  You get bored of staring at the guitar player's back all day
[23:54.720 --> 23:56.800]  because the guitar player's asses are all to you.
[23:56.800 --> 24:00.480]  So I looked up, and I see this light coming from the attic.
[24:00.480 --> 24:03.360]  And I'm like, oh, shit, that's a high-intensity discharge light.
[24:03.360 --> 24:04.960]  They've got an HPS light up there.
[24:04.960 --> 24:06.640]  They're growing some fucking weed up there.
[24:06.640 --> 24:09.120]  And it's just like the crawl space in the garage, a little storage area.
[24:09.760 --> 24:12.880]  So I waited for everybody to leave, except for the dude that owns the place.
[24:12.880 --> 24:13.680]  It was his space.
[24:13.680 --> 24:17.520]  And I go, hey, bro, not to be an asshole, but I got hit in the face with a grow light
[24:17.520 --> 24:18.480]  a couple of times up there.
[24:18.480 --> 24:19.920]  What you got up there?
[24:19.920 --> 24:22.560]  And he kind of looked at me like, huh, we'd smoke together.
[24:22.560 --> 24:23.360]  We'd drink together.
[24:23.360 --> 24:24.240]  We're bros.
[24:24.240 --> 24:25.520]  So he goes, what do you know about a grow?
[24:26.240 --> 24:27.920]  And I was like, I'm OK in a grow.
[24:27.920 --> 24:29.360]  I've never been in charge of a grow.
[24:29.360 --> 24:30.880]  But I've been a helper plenty of times.
[24:31.440 --> 24:32.800]  And he's like, well, then come up here.
[24:32.800 --> 24:33.600]  Help me out.
[24:33.600 --> 24:34.640]  And he's like, I got a problem.
[24:34.640 --> 24:35.600]  I need help doing this.
[24:35.600 --> 24:36.960]  And I'm going to be out of town for a few days.
[24:36.960 --> 24:37.680]  Can you take over?
[24:37.680 --> 24:38.400]  And I was like, sure.
[24:38.400 --> 24:39.360]  So he goes out of town.
[24:40.000 --> 24:41.520]  And he ended up getting in trouble.
[24:41.520 --> 24:44.480]  And he was gone for several days, way more days than expected.
[24:44.480 --> 24:45.760]  So I kind of took care of that crop.
[24:46.480 --> 24:47.360]  Harvest time came.
[24:48.320 --> 24:49.680]  And I was there through the whole harvest.
[24:49.680 --> 24:50.960]  I helped the dude pull down the plants.
[24:50.960 --> 24:51.680]  I helped him trim.
[24:51.680 --> 24:54.480]  I got paid pretty decently for helping him trim some weed.
[24:54.480 --> 24:55.760]  And this was in Kansas, you guys.
[24:55.760 --> 24:59.040]  So I got paid a little extra, because we were really running a risk being in Kansas.
[24:59.600 --> 25:01.760]  It was still completely illegal.
[25:01.760 --> 25:06.400]  And we were growing in basically a jam space where we had a band practice set up.
[25:06.400 --> 25:10.800]  So we were begging for attention every day with plants just right above my head.
[25:10.800 --> 25:14.240]  I could reach up and touch the ceiling where these plants were sitting on, actually,
[25:14.240 --> 25:16.080]  which would be the floor on the opposite side.
[25:16.080 --> 25:19.520]  So I got to finish that crop with my buddy in Kansas.
[25:20.080 --> 25:22.560]  I actually brought some of that that we grew.
[25:22.560 --> 25:26.000]  What I got paid with, I brought that back to Colorado and shared that with a lot of
[25:26.000 --> 25:26.560]  my friends here.
[25:26.560 --> 25:28.640]  And my friends are like, dude, you guys kind of killed it.
[25:28.640 --> 25:30.640]  And they were kind of impressed with my herb.
[25:30.640 --> 25:33.440]  So I had to move back to Colorado for some family reasons.
[25:33.440 --> 25:34.640]  My grandparents were passing.
[25:34.640 --> 25:37.440]  I came to spend the kind of final days with them.
[25:37.440 --> 25:39.680]  You know, it was one of my good excuses to get away.
[25:39.680 --> 25:41.440]  Lawrence, Kansas was fucking me up, you guys.
[25:41.440 --> 25:42.480]  I became an alcoholic.
[25:42.480 --> 25:43.600]  I became a drug addict.
[25:43.600 --> 25:45.200]  I needed to get away from there and change my life.
[25:45.200 --> 25:47.600]  And honestly, I have not drank since Lawrence, Kansas.
[25:48.480 --> 25:50.080]  I'm not blaming it on Kansas.
[25:50.080 --> 25:52.720]  But once I left there, I was able to get away from that lifestyle.
[25:52.720 --> 25:54.320]  And I feel like I'm way more productive.
[25:54.320 --> 25:56.320]  Anyway, I moved back to Colorado.
[25:57.120 --> 26:00.000]  And I get a medical marijuana card.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.680]  Because there's not a lot of weed on the streets anymore.
[26:03.680 --> 26:07.680]  And the weed that I can find isn't up to the expectations that I'm looking for.
[26:07.680 --> 26:10.480]  And it's not as available as I would like it to be.
[26:10.480 --> 26:12.880]  So I get a medical marijuana card.
[26:12.880 --> 26:16.480]  And I told myself that when I got this medical marijuana card, I would quit drinking.
[26:16.480 --> 26:20.160]  Now that there's as much cannabis available as I want, why do I need to drink, right?
[26:20.160 --> 26:22.160]  So I go to a couple of dispensaries.
[26:22.160 --> 26:23.120]  And some of them were OK.
[26:23.120 --> 26:24.960]  This was when it was the wild, wild west, you guys.
[26:24.960 --> 26:26.480]  This was way different.
[26:26.480 --> 26:27.840]  So I go to a couple of dispensaries.
[26:27.840 --> 26:29.680]  And I don't really see anything that impresses me.
[26:29.680 --> 26:32.080]  But I made friends all over the industry.
[26:32.080 --> 26:33.760]  And then one day, somebody told me,
[26:33.760 --> 26:37.040]  hey, there's a new dispensary in your neighborhood, but it's kind of a private deal.
[26:37.760 --> 26:40.480]  And they told me that you had to call this number first.
[26:40.480 --> 26:41.920]  And then they would tell you where to go.
[26:41.920 --> 26:44.080]  And then you had to knock on the door at the back of this building.
[26:44.080 --> 26:44.960]  And they would let you in.
[26:45.600 --> 26:47.840]  So I get my card ready.
[26:47.840 --> 26:48.720]  I get my ID.
[26:48.720 --> 26:49.440]  And I called the number.
[26:49.440 --> 26:51.360]  And the guy's like, sure, I'll be home in about a half hour.
[26:51.360 --> 26:51.920]  It's my house.
[26:51.920 --> 26:52.960]  Just come knock on my door.
[26:53.520 --> 26:54.480]  So I knock on his door.
[26:54.480 --> 26:55.200]  And he lets me in.
[26:55.200 --> 26:56.080]  He's up.
[26:56.080 --> 26:57.920]  So there was an old health food store downtown.
[26:57.920 --> 26:59.680]  And it was a three-story building.
[26:59.680 --> 27:03.360]  And you have to walk up the back stairs to the third story and knock on the door.
[27:03.360 --> 27:04.720]  And this dude had an apartment up there.
[27:05.280 --> 27:08.320]  And he would ask for your ID and your medical marijuana card.
[27:08.320 --> 27:10.000]  Then he would have you sit on the couch.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.760]  And then he would light up a joint and smoke with you.
[27:11.760 --> 27:13.680]  And then after you smoked about half the joint,
[27:13.680 --> 27:16.800]  he would bring out a couple of different bags of weed.
[27:16.800 --> 27:19.360]  I remember one of the first ones he showed me was chocolate chunk.
[27:19.360 --> 27:21.680]  And then he had AK-47, Northern Lights.
[27:22.560 --> 27:23.280]  There was another one.
[27:23.280 --> 27:23.840]  I can't remember.
[27:23.840 --> 27:24.800]  I wish I remembered.
[27:24.800 --> 27:27.120]  But I remember the chocolate chunk got my attention.
[27:27.120 --> 27:28.320]  So he comes and shows me.
[27:28.320 --> 27:29.680]  He shows you these strains.
[27:29.680 --> 27:32.000]  And then he only let me buy a quarter the first time.
[27:32.000 --> 27:32.880]  He's like, no, I don't know you.
[27:32.880 --> 27:33.280]  I don't know.
[27:33.280 --> 27:34.960]  He checked my medical marijuana papers, too.
[27:34.960 --> 27:39.440]  He made a copy of my ID and my medical marijuana card and sold me a quarter
[27:40.080 --> 27:42.080]  and told me that I could come back every day if I wanted.
[27:42.080 --> 27:43.440]  And we'd make friends and all that stuff.
[27:43.440 --> 27:47.280]  So I was kind of grabbing herb for other people.
[27:47.280 --> 27:49.760]  I would go get weed for the girl I was dating at the time.
[27:49.760 --> 27:51.520]  I would grab weed for my neighbor.
[27:51.520 --> 27:53.760]  There was a DJ friend of mine who needed weed all the time.
[27:53.760 --> 27:56.800]  And I was the only one that really knew about this dispensary in my group.
[27:57.360 --> 27:59.040]  So I would go there every day.
[27:59.040 --> 28:00.560]  I would gather all my friends' money.
[28:00.560 --> 28:01.680]  I'd go to this dispensary.
[28:01.680 --> 28:02.400]  I'd ring the doorbell.
[28:02.400 --> 28:02.880]  I'd call him up.
[28:02.880 --> 28:03.760]  I'd ring the doorbell.
[28:04.640 --> 28:05.440]  And then he'd let me in.
[28:05.440 --> 28:06.800]  And we'd sit on the couch, smoke a joint.
[28:06.800 --> 28:08.080]  And he'd sell me a couple of quarters.
[28:08.080 --> 28:10.880]  And every day I'd go, he'd sell me a little bit more and a little bit more.
[28:10.880 --> 28:12.240]  Then he'd be like, so what are you doing?
[28:12.240 --> 28:15.520]  This is just for the people on my block, the people that sit in my basement and smoke weed
[28:15.520 --> 28:17.200]  all day instead of them smoking all my weed.
[28:17.200 --> 28:18.880]  I'm grabbing weed for everybody.
[28:18.880 --> 28:19.920]  And he's like, all right, cool.
[28:21.600 --> 28:23.520]  And I could tell that he's overwhelmed with work.
[28:23.520 --> 28:24.720]  He was just completely slammed.
[28:25.280 --> 28:28.080]  I walk up the stairs and I could see that he's been carrying shit up the stairs and
[28:28.080 --> 28:29.120]  it's all piled up by the door.
[28:29.120 --> 28:31.280]  And I could tell that he's getting ready to transplant.
[28:31.280 --> 28:33.120]  And I was like, you're going to transplant some plants, bro?
[28:33.120 --> 28:34.960]  And he goes, yeah, you ever done that before?
[28:34.960 --> 28:37.600]  And I was like, oh yeah, I've transplanted a whole bunch of plants in my life.
[28:37.600 --> 28:38.480]  Because I have at this point.
[28:38.480 --> 28:39.440]  I've been growing for a little bit.
[28:40.160 --> 28:41.520]  I've helped with a couple other gardens.
[28:42.160 --> 28:45.440]  And of course, I got that little lesson when I was a little kid from my grower neighbor
[28:45.440 --> 28:46.720]  in the apartment building.
[28:46.720 --> 28:48.160]  So I was like, yeah, I can definitely help you.
[28:48.160 --> 28:50.160]  And he goes, tell you what, come back tomorrow.
[28:51.040 --> 28:53.920]  Come back at like 10 in the morning and we'll do all of this tomorrow.
[28:53.920 --> 28:55.040]  I'll show you the grow and everything.
[28:55.040 --> 28:55.680]  And I was like, cool.
[28:55.680 --> 28:56.480]  So I go back.
[28:56.480 --> 28:59.120]  Of course, I show up a few minutes early and he's impressed by that.
[28:59.120 --> 29:00.480]  We smoke and get good and stoned.
[29:00.480 --> 29:01.600]  And then he shows me the grow.
[29:01.600 --> 29:02.960]  They had a bunch of lights.
[29:02.960 --> 29:04.800]  This was a third story building that they had.
[29:04.800 --> 29:06.880]  His apartment was on the top story.
[29:06.880 --> 29:10.240]  The middle story was all the big grow.
[29:10.880 --> 29:14.720]  And so he shows me the grow and he's like, we need to pot all of these pots into bigger
[29:14.720 --> 29:15.360]  pots.
[29:15.360 --> 29:16.800]  So I'm like, cool, let's do it.
[29:16.800 --> 29:19.920]  And it took me like, I don't know, maybe seven hours to do all those.
[29:19.920 --> 29:22.320]  He watched me do a few and he's like, shit, this guy knows what he's doing.
[29:22.320 --> 29:25.520]  And he just went out and did his own business and left me there to do those pots.
[29:26.240 --> 29:28.160]  I went up back up the stairs and got him.
[29:28.160 --> 29:29.520]  I was like, hey, bro, these are all done.
[29:29.520 --> 29:32.960]  And he's like, cool, we will pay you at the end of the week because everybody gets paychecks
[29:32.960 --> 29:34.000]  at the end of the week around here.
[29:34.000 --> 29:35.280]  I'll have money then.
[29:35.280 --> 29:38.560]  I just come back at the end of the week and I'll give you some money or you can have credit
[29:38.560 --> 29:40.720]  at the store because you shop here anyway.
[29:40.720 --> 29:42.480]  And I was like, I'm good on herb.
[29:42.480 --> 29:43.680]  You know, I've been buying a bunch of weed.
[29:43.680 --> 29:44.000]  I'm cool.
[29:44.000 --> 29:45.440]  I'll just come back at the end of the week and get money.
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.280]  And then so I would show up for the next few days and I would go to buy my regular quarter
[29:51.280 --> 29:54.480]  or half ounce or whatever I was getting for the crew and I would just bring cash for that.
[29:54.480 --> 29:56.560]  But then he would always have work for me when I would show up.
[29:56.560 --> 29:58.000]  He'd be like, well, you transplanted those.
[29:58.000 --> 29:59.040]  Do you know how to cut clones?
[29:59.040 --> 30:00.160]  And I was like, I know how to cut clones.
[30:00.160 --> 30:01.200]  Let's do this.
[30:01.200 --> 30:04.320]  So we go in a little room and we cut like 100 clones and he's like, write down how many
[30:04.320 --> 30:06.080]  hours you worked and we'll pay you on Friday or whatever.
[30:06.080 --> 30:07.120]  And I was like, cool.
[30:07.120 --> 30:10.400]  So throughout the week, I work a few hours and Friday comes along and he's like, how
[30:10.400 --> 30:11.520]  many hours do you think you worked?
[30:11.520 --> 30:15.040]  And I was like, you probably owe me, you know, a couple hundred bucks or whatever I came
[30:15.040 --> 30:15.280]  up with.
[30:15.280 --> 30:16.800]  I don't remember the numbers now.
[30:16.800 --> 30:21.120]  And he's like, well, here, the boss sent you this and he handed me a nice stack of cash.
[30:21.120 --> 30:22.720]  And I was like, that's way too much money, bro.
[30:22.720 --> 30:26.320]  And he goes, well, we want you to come work for us every week and we want you here from
[30:26.320 --> 30:30.320]  like 10 to five every day and we'll pay you this much every week if you just show up and
[30:30.320 --> 30:31.280]  do the work.
[30:31.280 --> 30:32.240]  And I was like, holy shit.
[30:32.240 --> 30:33.040]  Okay.
[30:33.040 --> 30:37.280]  So this dude was running the dispensary out of his bedroom and I was running the grow
[30:37.280 --> 30:40.800]  on the second story and then he would have to go run errands.
[30:40.800 --> 30:42.640]  He would do deliveries also at this time.
[30:42.640 --> 30:44.640]  It was kind of, it might've been illegal back in the day, but whatever.
[30:44.640 --> 30:45.440]  That's already passed.
[30:46.000 --> 30:49.760]  Uh, he was going to do deliveries and he'd be like, Hey bro, people are coming up to
[30:49.760 --> 30:50.480]  the store.
[30:50.480 --> 30:51.680]  Will you be able to help them out?
[30:51.680 --> 30:52.720]  And I was like, I got this.
[30:53.280 --> 30:56.800]  And so one night I'm helping, we actually had medical marijuana patients that would
[30:56.800 --> 30:57.280]  show up.
[30:57.280 --> 31:00.720]  These people were really sick and we were a real dispensary.
[31:00.720 --> 31:04.560]  So one night there was an elderly couple came and I'll never forget them.
[31:04.560 --> 31:07.760]  This lady was actually sick and we sat on the couch.
[31:08.400 --> 31:11.920]  And as I was having the conversation, the guy that was running this dispensary showed
[31:11.920 --> 31:12.080]  up.
[31:12.960 --> 31:16.880]  And he got to hear me explain the differences between Indica's and sativas.
[31:16.880 --> 31:19.680]  And he let me, he got to hear me kind of.
[31:20.640 --> 31:21.680]  Caregiver for this woman.
[31:21.680 --> 31:25.360]  I had built a relationship with her over a few minutes and figured out what's wrong with
[31:25.360 --> 31:25.520]  her.
[31:25.520 --> 31:29.840]  What, why she's sick, how she likes to consume cannabis, what she's consuming for, how it
[31:29.840 --> 31:30.800]  makes her feel.
[31:30.800 --> 31:34.480]  If Indica's or sativas work better for her, what the difference is between Indica's and
[31:34.480 --> 31:35.280]  sativas.
[31:35.280 --> 31:39.520]  I spent 30 minutes talking with this lady to make sure that I sold her the right cannabis
[31:39.520 --> 31:40.800]  and to make her feel comfortable.
[31:40.800 --> 31:43.120]  It was her first time buying cannabis from a store.
[31:43.120 --> 31:46.640]  So this dude that actually ran the place walked in and saw me doing this.
[31:46.640 --> 31:49.040]  And he's like, bro, you are amazing at that.
[31:49.040 --> 31:52.240]  I have no business doing it after seeing what you just did with that lady.
[31:52.240 --> 31:54.320]  So he's like, you were kind of now the bud tender guy.
[31:54.320 --> 31:55.760]  There wasn't the word bud tender.
[31:55.760 --> 31:57.680]  I don't think existed at that point.
[31:57.680 --> 31:59.280]  So he's like, you are now the sales guy.
[31:59.280 --> 32:00.560]  You're going to be dealing with the customers.
[32:00.560 --> 32:02.080]  And I was like, I've got this.
[32:02.080 --> 32:05.440]  So I would grow weed most of the day and deal with the customers.
[32:06.080 --> 32:09.280]  And then I realized I was like, we've got a dispensary on the third story.
[32:09.280 --> 32:12.400]  I was like, why don't we have this down on the first floor where everybody can access
[32:12.400 --> 32:12.560]  it?
[32:12.560 --> 32:15.360]  And they said that the city asked them not to do that.
[32:15.360 --> 32:17.760]  And I was like, well, we've got all of the proper licensing.
[32:19.120 --> 32:22.560]  Monday when I come in, I'm going to move the store down to the first floor.
[32:22.560 --> 32:24.320]  And we went to the second story first.
[32:24.320 --> 32:27.120]  We moved, we cleaned out an area and went to the second story so that you could come
[32:27.120 --> 32:29.440]  into the first door on the bottom story.
[32:29.440 --> 32:31.360]  And it would be a little office area and we'd greet you.
[32:31.360 --> 32:33.520]  And then we'd take you up to the second floor and sell you buds.
[32:33.520 --> 32:34.800]  We did that for a little while.
[32:35.360 --> 32:37.360]  And then I just kept getting braver and ballsy.
[32:37.360 --> 32:40.880]  I was like, we got to move this down to the first floor where the handicap people can
[32:40.880 --> 32:41.040]  come.
[32:41.040 --> 32:42.720]  It's a medical marijuana dispensary.
[32:42.720 --> 32:44.000]  So we moved it to the first floor.
[32:44.800 --> 32:46.960]  And the owner was really excited about what I was doing.
[32:46.960 --> 32:48.240]  He's like, I love that you got balls.
[32:48.240 --> 32:49.920]  He's like, I love that you can help the customers.
[32:49.920 --> 32:51.280]  He's like, I love the way you deal with things.
[32:51.280 --> 32:52.960]  You know about cannabis, you can grow.
[32:52.960 --> 32:54.960]  So he gave me a full-time position.
[32:56.480 --> 33:02.240]  And eventually the guy that hired me ended up moving on to open his own business.
[33:02.240 --> 33:06.720]  He wanted to open his own dispensary because he learned how to run it pretty much.
[33:06.720 --> 33:07.920]  He saw everything he needed to do.
[33:07.920 --> 33:09.360]  He had a dream of opening his own shop.
[33:09.360 --> 33:11.200]  He didn't want to work for my friend, Tom.
[33:11.200 --> 33:13.520]  Shout out to Tom Sexton and Karen Garnett.
[33:13.520 --> 33:17.040]  They're the ones who gave me a shot other than Richard, under Richard.
[33:17.040 --> 33:20.320]  Richard is the one that kind of told them to hire me, but then they trusted me with
[33:20.320 --> 33:21.280]  their shop and gave me a shot.
[33:21.280 --> 33:22.320]  So one day Richard left.
[33:23.200 --> 33:24.640]  There's a whole nother story on that.
[33:24.640 --> 33:26.880]  If you guys know me, you know that story there.
[33:26.880 --> 33:30.080]  And I'm not ever going to tell that on a podcast, but so Richard left one day.
[33:31.040 --> 33:33.200]  Tom and Karen came over to try to run the store.
[33:33.200 --> 33:34.800]  I pretty much had the store under control.
[33:35.600 --> 33:36.480]  I knew what I was doing.
[33:36.480 --> 33:38.560]  I knew all of our customers by first names.
[33:38.560 --> 33:40.880]  I had a young lady by the name of Tree.
[33:40.880 --> 33:41.440]  Shout out Tree.
[33:41.440 --> 33:43.360]  I don't know if you ever listened to this show, but I hope you do.
[33:43.360 --> 33:46.480]  There's a beautiful young lady named Tree who ran the front desk.
[33:46.480 --> 33:48.960]  And also for a short time, there was a young lady named Chrisanne.
[33:48.960 --> 33:50.080]  I hope you hear this, Chrisanne.
[33:50.080 --> 33:50.880]  I miss you.
[33:50.880 --> 33:53.040]  And I really hope we get to hang out and play some music sometime.
[33:53.920 --> 33:58.880]  Loved both of those ladies, but they were kind of my door girl, my door lady, my greeters,
[33:58.880 --> 33:59.680]  my, what do you call it?
[33:59.680 --> 34:00.560]  Receptionist kind of lady.
[34:00.560 --> 34:01.120]  They weren't mine.
[34:01.120 --> 34:03.360]  They were the, the shop's receptionist kind of person.
[34:03.360 --> 34:05.040]  They would check people in when they got there.
[34:05.040 --> 34:05.920]  They'd be like, hey, what's your name?
[34:05.920 --> 34:07.360]  Let me see your marijuana card.
[34:07.360 --> 34:07.600]  Cool.
[34:07.600 --> 34:08.720]  We'll put you in line.
[34:08.720 --> 34:09.840]  And then they'd send them back to me.
[34:09.840 --> 34:13.280]  They'd be like, Jeff, your patient Bill is heading back.
[34:13.280 --> 34:14.400]  So they'd come back and see me.
[34:15.600 --> 34:19.760]  The owner that originally owned the place would show up every day.
[34:19.760 --> 34:21.120]  And I'm kind of a systems guy.
[34:21.120 --> 34:22.640]  I make like systems and procedures.
[34:22.640 --> 34:26.080]  When you're running a dispensary, you've got to have like procedures in the way that shit
[34:26.080 --> 34:29.680]  flows or shit doesn't flow properly, just like any real business needs.
[34:29.680 --> 34:34.000]  So I would set up procedures and systems and nothing against my friend, Tom, who owned
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.400]  the place, but he's an old Southern boy from North Carolina and he doesn't believe in any
[34:38.400 --> 34:43.040]  sort of systems or order or putting things here or doing things this way.
[34:43.040 --> 34:47.440]  He just wants to smoke a joint and let things happen the way they do, which is beautiful,
[34:47.440 --> 34:48.880]  but it doesn't work for business.
[34:48.880 --> 34:53.440]  So one day I had to get the balls and I had to say, Hey, Tom, the best thing for your
[34:53.440 --> 34:56.400]  business right now would be for you to go on the mountain and grow the weed that you
[34:56.400 --> 34:59.040]  grow and bring that weed back to the dispensary and let me sell it.
[34:59.040 --> 35:00.080]  And you get the hell out of here.
[35:00.800 --> 35:01.760]  He's like, you really think so?
[35:01.760 --> 35:03.760]  And I was like, I love you, but you don't know how to run a business, dude.
[35:03.760 --> 35:06.320]  You're kind of a train wreck when it comes to a retail establishment.
[35:06.320 --> 35:07.440]  And he took it very well.
[35:07.440 --> 35:10.480]  So he handed me the keys and he said, young man, you got yourself a dispensary.
[35:10.480 --> 35:11.200]  Don't do me wrong.
[35:11.200 --> 35:13.280]  And he left and he let me run that dispensary.
[35:14.240 --> 35:15.920]  We ran that for quite a while.
[35:15.920 --> 35:19.600]  That's how I met our friend, White Mike, that comes on the podcast here.
[35:20.320 --> 35:21.280]  I met Mike there.
[35:21.280 --> 35:22.480]  I hired Mike.
[35:22.480 --> 35:24.800]  Mike was the first person I ever hired.
[35:24.800 --> 35:27.600]  The first time I ever hired anybody as an employee, it was Mike.
[35:27.600 --> 35:32.880]  I hired Mike to work as a backup bud tender at Metamore Ministries dispensary in Pueblo,
[35:32.880 --> 35:33.360]  Colorado.
[35:33.360 --> 35:34.080]  That's how we met.
[35:35.840 --> 35:36.880]  So I hired a few people.
[35:36.880 --> 35:37.920]  The shop got huge.
[35:38.640 --> 35:40.320]  We were the only shop in town.
[35:40.320 --> 35:43.440]  We were the most popular shop in this part of Colorado for a little while.
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.360]  We hired a couple more employees.
[35:45.360 --> 35:46.960]  We hired several more employees.
[35:46.960 --> 35:51.920]  We had Jordan and Andrea as backup bud tenders and computer people and managers.
[35:52.560 --> 35:55.360]  But anyway, I'm kind of getting sidetracked here talking about Metamore.
[35:55.360 --> 35:57.280]  I'm reminiscing in my own head.
[35:57.280 --> 36:02.160]  One day, a city manager and a police officer came in and handed us a cease and desist letter
[36:02.160 --> 36:05.520]  that said we could no longer serve cannabis out of that location.
[36:06.240 --> 36:10.800]  So we pretty much, all of the patients that were in the store, we gave them most of the
[36:10.800 --> 36:12.800]  product that was on the shelf because we were now closed.
[36:12.800 --> 36:14.000]  There was nothing we could do with it.
[36:14.720 --> 36:16.640]  I remember I picked a jar of sour diesel.
[36:16.640 --> 36:18.160]  Mike picked a jar of chocolate chunk.
[36:18.160 --> 36:19.600]  Jordan picked a jar of what he liked.
[36:19.600 --> 36:21.120]  And Andrea picked a jar of what he liked.
[36:21.120 --> 36:22.000]  And we took those jars.
[36:22.000 --> 36:23.920]  The boss was like, go get a jar, do whatever you want.
[36:23.920 --> 36:25.200]  I don't care what happens to the product.
[36:25.200 --> 36:26.080]  We're closed.
[36:26.080 --> 36:26.880]  You can have the shit.
[36:27.440 --> 36:29.520]  So the owner gave us the product.
[36:29.520 --> 36:32.880]  We gave most of the edibles and all that perishable stuff to all the people that...
[36:33.520 --> 36:35.680]  So when the cop came in, a bunch of people just left.
[36:35.680 --> 36:36.720]  They're like, fuck this.
[36:36.720 --> 36:37.600]  And they got out of there.
[36:37.600 --> 36:39.840]  But the people that stuck around, they got a lot of free products.
[36:39.840 --> 36:41.360]  So we just gave all that shit away.
[36:41.360 --> 36:43.920]  And then Metamore was officially closed.
[36:43.920 --> 36:46.400]  That was the end of that era, I guess.
[36:46.400 --> 36:48.640]  And that was my jumpstart into the industry.
[36:48.640 --> 36:51.840]  I'm going to take a quick drink of this frosty cold Dr. Pepper, and I'll tell you the rest.
[36:55.580 --> 36:59.820]  While I'm drinking Dr. Pepper, I want to give a huge shout out to my buddy, John Hunt.
[36:59.820 --> 37:01.180]  Much respect, much love.
[37:01.180 --> 37:03.180]  John Hunt is trying to quit drinking Dr. Pepper.
[37:04.380 --> 37:06.700]  I don't know why somebody would want to do such a thing to themselves.
[37:09.020 --> 37:09.500]  All right.
[37:09.500 --> 37:09.980]  I'm better.
[37:09.980 --> 37:10.620]  I'm back.
[37:10.620 --> 37:11.100]  Okay.
[37:11.100 --> 37:12.620]  So Metamore ends up closing, right?
[37:13.740 --> 37:16.380]  Everybody in this town knew who I was from Metamore.
[37:16.380 --> 37:19.020]  Everybody knew that I was in the weed game, that I was growing weed,
[37:19.020 --> 37:20.700]  that I had all the weed available.
[37:20.700 --> 37:22.300]  So everybody started calling my phone.
[37:22.300 --> 37:23.660]  They're like, hey, the store is closed.
[37:23.660 --> 37:24.940]  Where can we get some herb?
[37:25.900 --> 37:26.780]  I was still doing...
[37:26.780 --> 37:28.460]  I had what's called a caregiver grow.
[37:28.460 --> 37:31.420]  The whole time I was working at Metamore, I was acting as a caregiver.
[37:32.060 --> 37:34.220]  I had a personal home grow.
[37:34.220 --> 37:38.140]  It was completely legal and compliant with the state of Colorado because I was a private
[37:38.140 --> 37:42.620]  registered caregiver for five other medical marijuana patients and myself, which meant
[37:42.620 --> 37:44.940]  that I was allowed to grow plants for myself and them.
[37:45.740 --> 37:49.500]  So I was growing product for myself and my patients, but a lot of these people were trying
[37:49.500 --> 37:50.700]  to get it from me.
[37:50.700 --> 37:55.020]  So there were a select few that honestly, I sold the shit out of some weed to those guys.
[37:55.020 --> 37:55.900]  But I don't do that anymore.
[37:55.900 --> 37:56.860]  So I can talk about it.
[37:56.940 --> 38:01.660]  But what I really ended up doing was I was caregiving and I was consulting and teaching
[38:01.660 --> 38:03.660]  people how to be a better caregiver.
[38:03.660 --> 38:04.380]  So I would go...
[38:04.940 --> 38:08.860]  If you didn't know how to grow weed yet, I'd go to your house and I'd help you set up your
[38:08.860 --> 38:09.100]  grow.
[38:09.100 --> 38:11.580]  I'd figure out how much herb you need to grow, how much space you've got.
[38:11.580 --> 38:12.700]  We'd set you up.
[38:12.700 --> 38:16.620]  And then I would either get a fee upfront or I would get a portion of your harvest.
[38:16.620 --> 38:20.620]  So that's kind of how I stayed afloat there and kept myself real popular into this cannabis
[38:20.620 --> 38:22.940]  industry around here, that and caregiving.
[38:23.740 --> 38:30.940]  As soon as I saw Medimar start, I'd been breeding seeds and crossing plants a little bit before
[38:30.940 --> 38:33.180]  now, before this time.
[38:33.180 --> 38:38.140]  But when Medimar went down, I realized that I needed something solid because the consulting
[38:38.140 --> 38:40.300]  thing was great, but it's unreliable.
[38:40.300 --> 38:43.980]  People around here, they say they're going to pay and a lot of times they kind of don't
[38:43.980 --> 38:44.860]  want to pay.
[38:44.860 --> 38:50.380]  So I started breeding seeds for retail distribution and that's how iRegenetics came up.
[38:50.380 --> 38:51.820]  I was posting pictures online.
[38:51.820 --> 38:53.980]  People were loving my cannabis pictures.
[38:53.980 --> 38:59.420]  I decided to make an iRegenetics Facebook page and then iRegenetics really exploded.
[39:00.140 --> 39:05.260]  I began vending my seeds to a vendor or distributing my seeds to a vendor known as
[39:05.260 --> 39:06.700]  naturesgreenremedies.com.
[39:06.700 --> 39:09.180]  They are now known as thedankteam.com.
[39:09.180 --> 39:11.980]  They might have a little bit of my products available right now, you guys.
[39:11.980 --> 39:15.900]  If you check them out, thedankteam.com, you may be able to get some iRegenetics seeds
[39:15.900 --> 39:16.220]  from there.
[39:16.220 --> 39:18.060]  So I started putting my seeds out.
[39:18.060 --> 39:21.340]  I went to a few cannabis cups and hustled millions of seeds.
[39:21.340 --> 39:25.420]  I've got millions of seeds out in the planet now that are my fault that I've given away
[39:25.420 --> 39:26.220]  and or sold.
[39:26.940 --> 39:30.620]  So I was noticing that I was getting a little stagnant, honestly.
[39:30.620 --> 39:31.420]  I had the podcast.
[39:31.980 --> 39:35.820]  After the seed company got going, I started doing a podcast with my friend, Wade.
[39:35.820 --> 39:38.060]  We had a podcast called 719 The Blocks.
[39:38.060 --> 39:41.420]  It is now defunct, but he was doing a podcast.
[39:41.420 --> 39:45.420]  One night I went to a comedy show and he wanted to do a podcast after the comedy show and
[39:45.420 --> 39:46.460]  he didn't have anywhere to do it.
[39:46.460 --> 39:49.740]  I've got this sweet table and I was like, let's go to my house and record.
[39:49.740 --> 39:50.300]  It'll be fun.
[39:50.860 --> 39:56.540]  So I did a podcast with Wade and I honestly fell in love with podcasting because of that.
[39:56.540 --> 40:01.340]  But I did not like the equipment that Wade had and I didn't approve of the quality production
[40:01.340 --> 40:02.540]  that Wade was doing.
[40:02.540 --> 40:07.900]  And so I kind of volunteered to help Wade get his show up to par and I bought some recording.
[40:07.900 --> 40:10.540]  I already had some equipment because I'm a drummer and a musician, but I bought a couple
[40:10.540 --> 40:11.900]  other add-ons for my equipment.
[40:12.620 --> 40:17.180]  Bought an interface to make it work with my MacBook, started podcasting, fell in love
[40:17.180 --> 40:18.460]  with podcasting with Wade.
[40:18.460 --> 40:22.300]  We did a couple episodes that featured cannabis and then he got tired of hearing about weed
[40:22.300 --> 40:23.100]  on his show.
[40:23.100 --> 40:28.540]  So I made my own cannabis spinoff and we're here now at 112 episodes.
[40:28.540 --> 40:29.100]  Holy crap.
[40:29.100 --> 40:33.260]  Thank you guys for listening to me rant this long and for listening to 112 episodes.
[40:33.260 --> 40:34.460]  So I started podcasting.
[40:36.460 --> 40:40.060]  Then there were a bunch of dispensaries opening up in my area and I was watching a lot of
[40:40.060 --> 40:44.380]  my friends in my age group get really cool jobs at dispensaries and it just kind of looks
[40:44.380 --> 40:44.860]  like fun.
[40:44.860 --> 40:46.140]  I missed the Metamore days.
[40:46.140 --> 40:47.340]  I missed having coworkers.
[40:47.340 --> 40:52.380]  I was working from home and private facilities and I wasn't having the interactions with
[40:52.380 --> 40:55.020]  the social interactions that I missed, that I desired.
[40:55.580 --> 40:59.020]  So my buddy, Kevin, our old friend, Kevin, that used to be on the show, he worked at
[40:59.020 --> 41:02.860]  the spa dispensary and he kept putting in good words for me and saying that they should
[41:02.860 --> 41:06.060]  hit me up and have me be their grower because they were having issues with their master
[41:06.060 --> 41:06.540]  grower.
[41:07.420 --> 41:09.660]  So I kept putting that off and putting that off.
[41:10.700 --> 41:15.740]  And then I decided I started dating a girl named Angela and Angela got a job at the spa
[41:15.740 --> 41:17.340]  and talked about how much fun it was.
[41:17.340 --> 41:18.860]  And so they would have functions.
[41:20.060 --> 41:20.700]  What's his name?
[41:20.700 --> 41:23.500]  Afro man came out to the spot and we got to meet Afro man.
[41:24.060 --> 41:28.140]  They did a few other things that I went to as a guest with Angela and I hung out and
[41:28.140 --> 41:29.740]  the spot crew was a bunch of fun people.
[41:29.740 --> 41:30.860]  I had a good time with them.
[41:32.060 --> 41:36.300]  We're all dirty minded dudes and I had a really good time with Rob and with Dave and with
[41:36.300 --> 41:37.260]  Vegas and with the whole crew.
[41:37.260 --> 41:38.540]  I really got along with everybody.
[41:39.580 --> 41:44.300]  So one day Angela said, hey, they want you to come in and talk about a job.
[41:44.300 --> 41:46.780]  So I walked into the spot dispensary and they're like, who are you?
[41:46.780 --> 41:47.340]  What do you do?
[41:47.340 --> 41:48.300]  And I was like, I'm Rasta Jeff.
[41:48.300 --> 41:49.420]  I'm the owner of Iry Genetics.
[41:49.420 --> 41:50.460]  I've been growing for this long.
[41:50.460 --> 41:51.660]  I've been breeding for this long.
[41:52.300 --> 41:56.700]  I helped found the only dispensary in the city of Pueblo, Colorado.
[41:56.700 --> 41:58.540]  We've got a podcast with this many listeners.
[41:58.540 --> 42:02.860]  I had at the time an Instagram following of like 15,000 followers, which has been deleted.
[42:03.820 --> 42:06.220]  So I just threw down who I was and what I did.
[42:06.220 --> 42:09.100]  And they looked me straight in the face and they said, can you grow hydro?
[42:09.100 --> 42:12.620]  And I told them, you know, I have very, very little hydro experience, but I'm pretty sure
[42:12.620 --> 42:15.500]  I can learn it because it's a cannabis plant and I can learn anything.
[42:15.500 --> 42:18.220]  And they looked at each other like they were impressed and they shook my hand and they said,
[42:18.220 --> 42:19.420]  how much money do you want to make?
[42:19.420 --> 42:20.860]  I told them and they said, okay.
[42:21.900 --> 42:25.820]  And I kicked myself in the ass because I should have shot a lot higher since they didn't budget
[42:25.820 --> 42:25.900]  all.
[42:25.900 --> 42:27.660]  They're like, okay, we'll pay you that.
[42:27.660 --> 42:30.060]  And so that's how I got into the spot.
[42:30.060 --> 42:34.140]  I basically, uh, they knew who I was from my buddy, Kevin, hyping them up.
[42:34.140 --> 42:37.180]  And then Angela told me that they were talking to her and that I should go in there and hit
[42:37.180 --> 42:38.300]  them up for a job.
[42:38.300 --> 42:40.940]  So I went in there and they gave me a job on the spot.
[42:40.940 --> 42:41.820]  So shout out to Kevin.
[42:41.820 --> 42:43.980]  Shout out to Angela and shout out to the whole spot crew.
[42:43.980 --> 42:46.620]  Even though I'm not there anymore, I have no ill will toward the spot.
[42:46.620 --> 42:47.900]  It's just not my spot for me.
[42:48.460 --> 42:51.100]  Um, they didn't have any plants and I need to grow plants.
[42:51.100 --> 42:55.340]  So that puts me into the next phase of how I got into the industry or where I am now
[42:55.340 --> 42:55.900]  in the industry.
[42:55.900 --> 42:56.220]  I guess.
[42:57.180 --> 42:58.860]  I worked at the spot for quite a while.
[42:58.860 --> 43:03.100]  They were having issues getting their grow rooms up and running and up to par.
[43:03.740 --> 43:07.820]  And I was struggling to find something to keep myself busy with for 40 hours.
[43:07.820 --> 43:08.700]  And I was on salary.
[43:08.700 --> 43:10.380]  So I was expected to be doing something.
[43:10.940 --> 43:14.460]  I caught myself cleaning dog shit in the parking lot one time and I thought about it and I was
[43:14.460 --> 43:18.700]  like, not to be conceited, but I was like, I'm a master grower and I'm pretty sure I
[43:18.700 --> 43:21.180]  make one of the top salaries in the building.
[43:21.180 --> 43:24.300]  Why am I out here picking up dog shit and not growing cannabis?
[43:25.580 --> 43:27.900]  And that really started to like eat at me.
[43:27.900 --> 43:33.020]  I was like, I'm doing things like sweeping up dead bugs and fixing hanging shelves in
[43:33.020 --> 43:33.580]  the bud room.
[43:33.580 --> 43:36.780]  I was like, I'm not here to be fucking Felix fix it or fix it.
[43:36.780 --> 43:37.980]  Felix from record Ralph, bro.
[43:37.980 --> 43:39.020]  That's not my duty.
[43:39.020 --> 43:40.780]  I'm kind of a cannabis grower.
[43:40.780 --> 43:45.900]  So one day I was at work and our good friend hunt from green and healthy wellness sent
[43:45.900 --> 43:49.180]  me a text message and it said, give me a call as soon as you can.
[43:49.180 --> 43:51.420]  And hunt doesn't really send out the SOS like that.
[43:51.420 --> 43:52.540]  Usually it's like, what's up, brother?
[43:52.540 --> 43:53.660]  Let's take dabs and you're free.
[43:53.660 --> 43:54.940]  But he said, as soon as you can.
[43:55.580 --> 43:59.900]  So since I wasn't doing a damn thing at the spot, anyway, I pulled out my phone.
[43:59.900 --> 44:00.460]  I gave him a call.
[44:00.460 --> 44:01.260]  I was like, what's up, brother?
[44:01.260 --> 44:05.980]  And he was like, Hey, there was an issue with my grower here and he no longer is employed
[44:05.980 --> 44:07.180]  and I need a master grower.
[44:07.900 --> 44:13.660]  And I was like, he actually was calling to ask if I had a partner or a minion that worked
[44:13.660 --> 44:17.820]  in my grows that I would donate to him so that he could have somebody to work his grows.
[44:17.820 --> 44:18.940]  And I said, you know what, hun?
[44:18.940 --> 44:19.820]  I want that job.
[44:20.540 --> 44:23.420]  And we agreed on a wage and a starting date.
[44:23.420 --> 44:28.860]  And, um, about six weeks ago, it feels like I took over as the lead cultivator at green
[44:28.860 --> 44:31.180]  and healthy wellness in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[44:31.820 --> 44:35.500]  Right now, the retail store, you know, by the time this episode comes out, we'll be
[44:35.500 --> 44:38.940]  just a few days away from the retail location opening.
[44:38.940 --> 44:43.180]  The new location is on four 30 West Colorado Avenue in Colorado Springs.
[44:43.180 --> 44:44.700]  It's the old gas station.
[44:44.700 --> 44:46.220]  We call it the Terp station.
[44:46.220 --> 44:48.220]  Now we've got some art in there.
[44:48.220 --> 44:51.980]  We had a professional artist come and do some beautiful art on the inside.
[44:51.980 --> 44:53.820]  The building is looking really great.
[44:53.820 --> 44:54.860]  There's a lot of parking.
[44:55.500 --> 45:00.140]  We will have a bunch of great product around February 1st.
[45:00.140 --> 45:05.180]  We will be harvesting the first round of green and healthy wellness medicine grown by myself.
[45:05.500 --> 45:07.100]  Rasta Jeff put this into flower.
[45:07.100 --> 45:08.860]  I've been taking good care of it.
[45:08.860 --> 45:10.220]  So it'll be ready pretty soon.
[45:10.220 --> 45:11.900]  But that's where I am now in the industry, you guys.
[45:11.900 --> 45:13.580]  That's pretty much how I got in the industry.
[45:13.580 --> 45:15.500]  And that's where I am today in the industry.
[45:16.220 --> 45:17.260]  I still breed seeds.
[45:17.260 --> 45:22.460]  My next breeding project will probably be making an F2 version of the strain Arise.
[45:22.460 --> 45:27.180]  I will also add about four or five other females into that selection.
[45:27.740 --> 45:32.380]  So there will be some Arise F2s and then a couple of Arise crosses that come out of
[45:32.380 --> 45:33.740]  iRegenetics in the near future.
[45:34.380 --> 45:37.820]  I do intend to keep this podcast going as long as people will listen.
[45:37.820 --> 45:41.900]  I know lately it's been a little bit unprepared, but that's because I'm working a lot of hours
[45:41.900 --> 45:44.700]  at green and healthy wellness, getting things put together there.
[45:44.700 --> 45:46.780]  I'm definitely adjusting to my new schedule.
[45:46.780 --> 45:48.220]  I'm getting everything back in order.
[45:48.220 --> 45:51.020]  So the shows are going to get back to what they used to be.
[45:51.020 --> 45:53.740]  I said that after episode 100, we'd get back into the grow lessons.
[45:53.740 --> 45:55.260]  And I've been doing it a little bit.
[45:55.260 --> 45:56.300]  It's the holiday season.
[45:56.300 --> 45:59.660]  So this episode and the one next week are just going to be me ranting about stuff.
[45:59.660 --> 46:03.980]  I think next week I'm going to talk a little bit about what I do in the grow room.
[46:03.980 --> 46:07.020]  I'm just going to kind of take you guys to the grow room with me.
[46:07.020 --> 46:07.820]  We'll walk into the grow.
[46:07.820 --> 46:10.220]  We'll talk about my chores that I do, the things that I check.
[46:10.220 --> 46:13.500]  We'll talk about my personal grow in a small home grow.
[46:13.500 --> 46:16.300]  And we'll talk about the large scale grow at green and healthy wellness.
[46:16.300 --> 46:17.820]  I'll try to talk about both of those.
[46:18.540 --> 46:24.140]  I also want to do a checklist of things that you guys should be doing on a daily,
[46:24.140 --> 46:25.740]  weekly and monthly basis.
[46:25.740 --> 46:27.980]  So those will probably be the next two episodes.
[46:28.780 --> 46:31.020]  Anyway, I feel like I'm rambling on and on and on.
[46:31.020 --> 46:33.100]  I'll keep this podcast going is what I was saying.
[46:33.900 --> 46:35.260]  I'm going to keep breeding seeds.
[46:35.260 --> 46:37.740]  I read genetics will continue to come out with new seeds.
[46:37.740 --> 46:40.540]  I will keep breeding my new stuff to my old stuff.
[46:40.540 --> 46:45.020]  Plus the newest crosses that I find that I really like will be bred into my lines.
[46:45.020 --> 46:46.060]  I'm going to keep that going.
[46:46.060 --> 46:47.580]  I will keep the podcast going.
[46:48.140 --> 46:50.300]  I will be at the Cannabis Cup for most of the days.
[46:50.300 --> 46:53.580]  If you guys are coming to the Denver Cannabis Cup over the 420 weekend,
[46:54.220 --> 46:56.300]  I will try to be there Saturday and Sunday.
[46:56.300 --> 47:00.060]  And of course, I will do my best to make an appearance for 420.
[47:00.060 --> 47:03.660]  Cannot promise you anything with the way the green and healthy wellness garden goes.
[47:03.660 --> 47:08.620]  That is a lot of work for myself, but I love every single minute of it.
[47:08.620 --> 47:11.660]  Guys, there will be some collaborations coming up in the very near future.
[47:11.660 --> 47:15.020]  I will be breeding some strains with some other well-known breeders.
[47:15.020 --> 47:20.220]  I will be also creating strains for some people who I can't even talk about right now.
[47:21.020 --> 47:24.620]  People that you know their names, you might listen to their music.
[47:24.620 --> 47:27.500]  You might watch their videos.
[47:27.500 --> 47:30.860]  There are things that you might do that we can't even talk about right now.
[47:30.860 --> 47:32.460]  But there's some cool shit coming up in the future.
[47:32.460 --> 47:36.140]  So you guys, I feel like I've rambled for a good 45 minutes now.
[47:36.140 --> 47:37.580]  Wow, I just looked at the time.
[47:37.580 --> 47:38.780]  This is going to be a long episode.
[47:38.780 --> 47:40.460]  I appreciate everybody for listening to it.
[47:40.460 --> 47:43.820]  That's where I came from in the industry, and that's where I am now, you guys.
[47:43.820 --> 47:47.180]  If you want to be part of the cannabis industry with me, send me an email.
[47:47.180 --> 47:48.540]  I'd love to see what you got going on.
[47:48.540 --> 47:49.820]  I'm open for collaborations.
[47:49.820 --> 47:52.940]  I'm up to advanced cannabis and my cannabis career.
[47:52.940 --> 47:56.860]  Email me at scrollfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[47:56.860 --> 47:59.260]  All right, guys, I'm going to start wrapping up the show.
[47:59.260 --> 48:00.380]  I want to thank you for listening.
[48:00.380 --> 48:03.020]  I'll be back next year.
[48:03.020 --> 48:05.420]  I will be back next year with episode 113.
[48:05.420 --> 48:10.140]  We're either going to do the checklist episode, or we're going to walk through my ganja garden
[48:10.140 --> 48:11.580]  and talk about my chores.
[48:11.580 --> 48:14.620]  Maybe we'll combine that into one long ass episode.
[48:14.620 --> 48:17.420]  You never know what Rasta Jeff is going to do.
[48:18.300 --> 48:20.780]  All right, don't forget to check out our sponsor, Hitman Glass, you guys.

[48:29.660 --> 48:30.940]  He posts a lot of stuff.
[48:31.580 --> 48:35.420]  The only person that posts more stuff than Hitman Dougie is Snoop Dogg is what I think.
[48:36.060 --> 48:39.980]  Anyway, if you guys would like to sponsor the show, or if you've got a product you'd

[50:54.300 --> 50:58.380]  Just don't get in a car and drive and kill somebody, kill yourself, ruin somebody's life.
[50:58.380 --> 51:00.300]  Please don't start the new year off like that.
[51:00.300 --> 51:01.580]  Please, I beg of you.
[51:01.580 --> 51:03.580]  Just don't get drunk and drive.
[51:03.580 --> 51:04.780]  Don't be on drugs and drive.
[51:04.780 --> 51:06.220]  If you're going to get fucked up, that's cool.
[51:06.220 --> 51:06.940]  Just stay parked.
[51:06.940 --> 51:08.220]  Let a sober person drive.
[51:08.220 --> 51:10.860]  That's what Lyft and Uber and friends are for.
[51:10.860 --> 51:12.300]  So take good care of one another.
[51:12.300 --> 51:13.420]  This happy new year, you guys.
[51:14.140 --> 51:16.140]  I want to give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[51:16.140 --> 51:19.740]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[52:13.060 --> 53:35.620]  The Happy New Year cannabis community.
[53:35.620 --> 53:39.140]  It's time for episode number 113 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[53:39.140 --> 53:42.500]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[53:43.060 --> 53:43.380]  That's right.
[53:43.380 --> 53:47.460]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[53:47.460 --> 53:51.860]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[53:51.860 --> 53:54.340]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[53:54.340 --> 53:54.900]  I'm your host.
[53:54.900 --> 53:56.100]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[53:56.100 --> 53:58.020]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[53:58.020 --> 54:01.540]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[54:01.540 --> 54:03.860]  band for letting me use their music on my show.
[54:03.860 --> 54:07.540]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[54:09.380 --> 54:09.780]  Yeah.
[54:09.780 --> 54:10.580]  Happy New Year, everybody.
[54:10.580 --> 54:12.180]  I hope you guys had a great new year.
[54:12.180 --> 54:14.180]  Hope you've made some new year's goals.
[54:14.180 --> 54:17.220]  If you haven't made some goals for the new year, you should grab a pen and a paper
[54:17.220 --> 54:21.220]  and you should just write down a few things that you want to accomplish in 2016.
[54:21.220 --> 54:22.820]  And when you get that feeling of accomplishment,
[54:22.820 --> 54:24.180]  you're going to want to accomplish bigger goals.
[54:24.180 --> 54:26.820]  So just write down some goals and get that shit done, you guys.
[54:26.820 --> 54:31.620]  And also, if you had some bullshit in 2015, now is the time to shake it off and leave it all behind.
[54:31.620 --> 54:36.180]  If you haven't forgotten about the bullshit of 2015, it's time to take a big old fat dab,
[54:36.820 --> 54:41.220]  smoke a big old fat joint, smoke a fat blunt, hit the vaporizer, however you do it.
[54:41.220 --> 54:45.940]  I'm going to take a big old fat dab and we're going to blow out all the bullshit of 2015.
[54:45.940 --> 54:47.940]  We're going to start fresh here in 2016.
[54:47.940 --> 54:51.780]  So we're going to do that out of my brand new Hitman short stack.
[54:51.780 --> 54:52.900]  Shout out to the Hitman crew.
[54:53.540 --> 54:54.180]  You guys know me.
[54:54.180 --> 54:58.100]  When I buy a rig, I like to buy an American rig, something made in America by an American.
[54:58.100 --> 54:59.700]  So I buy Hitman glass.
[54:59.700 --> 55:01.300]  Hitman glass is made by dabbers.
[55:01.300 --> 55:03.300]  These kids dab as hard as you and I do.
[55:03.300 --> 55:05.380]  Hitman Dougie is a dab enthusiast.
[55:05.380 --> 55:07.140]  He's a supporter of the hash movement.
[55:07.140 --> 55:10.740]  He throws a festival every summer in California called the Chalice Festival.
[55:10.740 --> 55:11.780]  Make sure you check that out.
[55:11.780 --> 55:14.420]  You guys, I'm going to hit my brand new Hitman short stack.
[55:15.060 --> 55:18.900]  I don't think there are words to describe this rig other than fucking amazing.
[55:18.900 --> 55:20.100]  So I've got the e-mail hooked up.
[55:20.100 --> 55:23.620]  I've got a big old glob of cactus cooler from Turpex on the dabber.
[55:23.620 --> 55:26.100]  You guys take a dab with me and then we will get on the show.
[55:26.100 --> 55:30.420]  Let's inhale some positivity and love and freshness and then we'll exhale.
[55:30.420 --> 55:33.380]  We're going to exhale all the bullshit from 2015.
[55:33.380 --> 55:34.820]  Let's take this dab together, you guys.
[55:46.910 --> 55:47.550]  All right.
[55:47.550 --> 55:49.150]  Well, that was all right.
[55:49.150 --> 55:50.350]  Well, I'm heavily medicated.
[55:50.350 --> 55:51.870]  Now this will be a fun podcast.
[55:51.870 --> 55:53.310]  So shout out to the Hitman glass crew.
[55:53.310 --> 55:55.150]  You guys make sure you follow Hitman glass.
[55:55.150 --> 55:56.910]  Go to hitmanglass.com.
[55:56.990 --> 55:59.230]  Also make sure you follow Dougie on Instagram.
[55:59.230 --> 56:00.270]  It's at Hitman glass.
[56:00.270 --> 56:02.030]  Dougie support Hitman glass.
[56:02.030 --> 56:07.790]  Glass made in America by Americans made by guys who dab just as hard as you are.
[56:07.790 --> 56:08.750]  I'm going to turn down this music.
[56:08.750 --> 56:09.710]  We'll get on with the show.
[56:09.710 --> 56:11.550]  You guys, I also want to make a huge announcement.
[56:11.550 --> 56:14.670]  Green and Healthy Wellness is now open for business.
[56:14.670 --> 56:18.110]  We are a medical marijuana facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[56:18.110 --> 56:20.190]  We are at 430 West Colorado Avenue.
[56:20.750 --> 56:24.110]  If you have a medical marijuana card, we would love to see you drop by,
[56:24.110 --> 56:28.750]  pick up some Turpex, pick up some apothecana, pick up some top shelf flowers.
[56:28.750 --> 56:29.870]  We'd love to see you in there.
[56:30.670 --> 56:35.470]  Big shout out to Britt, Carly, Haley, Buzzy, and especially Hunt.
[56:35.470 --> 56:37.870]  The entire crew, a big shout out for getting that place going.
[56:37.870 --> 56:39.070]  I'm proud of you guys.
[56:39.070 --> 56:40.190]  Drop in, give us a visit.
[56:41.230 --> 56:43.230]  What else do we have for business?
[56:43.950 --> 56:44.830]  The sticker packs.
[56:44.830 --> 56:50.270]  Remember a few episodes ago, we did a hashtag and everybody who messaged us on Twitter and
[56:50.270 --> 56:53.070]  used that hashtag, they're going to get a sticker pack.
[56:53.070 --> 56:57.710]  A couple of nights ago, Mike and I sat here and addressed envelopes and I will be stuffing
[56:57.710 --> 57:00.830]  stickers into those envelopes and they will go out Monday morning.
[57:00.830 --> 57:05.310]  When this podcast drops, those stickers will be in the mail Monday, the same day.
[57:05.310 --> 57:07.870]  By the time you hear this, the stickers are on the way to you.
[57:07.870 --> 57:10.190]  I've only got, let's see, how many do I have here that are addressed?
[57:10.190 --> 57:13.390]  I've got one, I've got two, and the third person already got there.
[57:13.390 --> 57:14.590]  I've only got two.
[57:14.590 --> 57:19.630]  If you were involved in that and you need to send me your address, send me your address
[57:19.710 --> 57:25.790]  to growfromyourheartathotmail.com and remind me that you deserve stickers from the hashtag,
[57:25.790 --> 57:28.510]  I like it when you ramble sticker giveaway.
[57:28.510 --> 57:29.790]  Remind me, I'll get you your stuff.
[57:30.510 --> 57:31.550]  What else do we got in?
[57:32.270 --> 57:34.430]  I need to give a big shout out to my buddy Frosty.
[57:34.430 --> 57:38.110]  I bumped into my friend Frosty at the Canada Canyon Dab Club the other day.
[57:38.110 --> 57:41.390]  Frosty, I smoked that Kush Bud that you gave me.
[57:41.390 --> 57:42.350]  Shit, dude, I was high.
[57:42.350 --> 57:43.070]  That was awesome.
[57:43.070 --> 57:43.790]  Thank you.
[57:43.790 --> 57:44.910]  I smoked that this morning.
[57:44.910 --> 57:46.030]  It was the first thing I smoked.
[57:46.030 --> 57:47.150]  It made my eyes a little droopy.
[57:47.150 --> 57:49.310]  It made me want to be nice and lazy for the day.
[57:49.310 --> 57:49.870]  Good weed, bro.
[57:49.870 --> 57:50.510]  I appreciate it.
[57:51.150 --> 57:54.350]  It's always wonderful to receive the gift of cannabis from friends.
[57:54.350 --> 57:58.270]  It's super great when your friends tell you that they listened to your podcast
[57:58.270 --> 58:01.550]  and learned how to improve their cannabis from listening to the show,
[58:01.550 --> 58:03.230]  and then they give you buds that they grew.
[58:04.350 --> 58:05.070]  Shout out to Frosty.
[58:05.070 --> 58:06.110]  That's super good weed, dude.
[58:06.110 --> 58:06.910]  I really appreciate it.
[58:06.910 --> 58:07.710]  You did a good job.
[58:08.590 --> 58:11.870]  Well flushed, well cured, and superbly trimmed.
[58:11.870 --> 58:12.510]  I like your work.
[58:13.310 --> 58:15.550]  Man, I got to give a shout out to everybody at the Canada Canyon.
[58:15.550 --> 58:20.430]  I dropped into the Canada Canyon, and everybody there is super kind, you guys.
[58:20.430 --> 58:23.710]  When I walk in, everybody's like, dab this, dab this, try this.
[58:23.710 --> 58:24.990]  I tried some live resin.
[58:24.990 --> 58:26.110]  I tried some butter.
[58:26.110 --> 58:27.150]  Tried some shatter.
[58:27.150 --> 58:28.350]  Smoked a little bit of everything.
[58:28.350 --> 58:29.790]  I had some solventless.
[58:29.790 --> 58:30.830]  Had some full melt.
[58:30.830 --> 58:32.590]  Had a little bit of everything the last time I was there.
[58:32.590 --> 58:35.150]  I really appreciate the way they treat me there.
[58:35.150 --> 58:37.310]  And shout out to all my friends at the Canada Canyon.
[58:37.310 --> 58:38.270]  Shout out to Camille.
[58:38.270 --> 58:40.110]  Shout out to everybody over there.
[58:40.110 --> 58:43.630]  I'll be doing an episode from there really soon that features our friend Foxtrax.
[58:43.630 --> 58:46.030]  So keep your ears open for that one.
[58:46.990 --> 58:47.390]  All right, guys.
[58:47.390 --> 58:48.590]  So let's get to the point of the show.
[58:48.590 --> 58:52.110]  I've been telling you that I was going to make a checklist of things that you should
[58:52.110 --> 58:53.870]  be taking care of in your garden.
[58:53.870 --> 58:55.230]  So I did that for you.
[58:55.230 --> 59:00.190]  I've got a list of things you should do daily, weekly, monthly, things you should do after
[59:00.190 --> 59:03.230]  each harvest, and also things that you should do yearly.
[59:03.230 --> 59:04.590]  There are a couple things on that list.
[59:05.230 --> 59:08.670]  So I think I'm going to take a dab and a drink while you guys listen to a couple of
[59:08.670 --> 59:09.790]  seconds of reggae music.
[59:09.790 --> 59:12.430]  And I will be right back, and we will get into this checklist.
[59:37.420 --> 59:38.860]  Here comes the danger.
[59:48.940 --> 59:50.380]  Here comes the danger.
[59:50.380 --> 59:52.380]  Here comes the danger.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:18.300]  All right, you guys.
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:21.260]  I am back, and I am ready to get into this checklist.
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:24.300]  Oh, I hope you guys are taking some dabs while I was taking dabs.
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:26.860]  I just hit some Cactus Cooler from Turpex.
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:31.420]  If you've ever cracked open a can of Cactus Cooler and taken a drink, that's exactly what
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.300]  this hash tastes like.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.220]  It's kind of got my mouth watering.
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.980]  Have you ever taken a dab that made your mouth water?
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.220]  Usually your mouth goes dry.
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.660]  Excuse me for coughing into the microphone.
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:43.740]  I was listening to a podcast today, and the co-host was just coughing into the microphone,
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.660]  and I really wanted to turn off the damn show.
[01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.260]  So I apologize for coughing into the mic.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:50.300]  Anyway, this checklist, here we go.
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.260]  This is stuff that I feel you should be doing every day.
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.860]  Some of this stuff will vary.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.340]  If you've got a hydro garden, some of this stuff will be different.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:00.140]  If you've got a soil garden, some of this stuff will be different.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:04.140]  Based on the size of your garden, some of this stuff will have to be done over a course
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:05.180]  of a couple of days.
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:10.380]  Some of this stuff will have to be, if you've got a little garden, this stuff is just things
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:11.980]  that'll take you two seconds.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:15.420]  So here is what I've got for your daily checklist.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:22.380]  Daily, visually check each plant for bugs, molds, or signs of deficiencies or over fertilization,
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.460]  and correct if necessary.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.380]  You got to get in there.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.300]  I walk in and I just pick a random plant, and I just pull a random leaf off of a random
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.700]  plant, and I flip it upside down, and I look at it.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.900]  And I make sure there's no bugs.
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:35.500]  I feel the leaf.
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.060]  I can tell by feeling the leaf how healthy the plant is.
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.740]  I can kind of rub on the leaf and tell.
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:43.500]  But I like to pull a leaf off, look for bugs, look for molds, look around the room, see
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.780]  if any of the leaves are yellow or crispy or crunchy or if anything's happening.
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.540]  If you've got anything weird going in there, work on correcting it.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:55.340]  Something I should add, anything that can be done today, do it today.
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:56.940]  Don't wait until tomorrow.
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.700]  You've got plenty of shit to do tomorrow.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.380]  Whatever you can do today, do it.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:03.260]  Or you just keep adding shit up for tomorrow, and then tomorrow never comes.
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.460]  And then one of these days, you're going to have a big ass list of shit that you never
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:10.220]  did, and you're going to find problems in your grow, and you're going to know why.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:13.340]  It's because you didn't do that list of shit that you should have been keeping up on.
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.860]  So try to stay on top of your chores, you guys.
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:15.580]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.420]  So check your plants every day.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.860]  You should be touching every single plant.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.620]  You should be putting your eyes on every single plant.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:21.980]  Get in there and love them.
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:25.500]  So the second thing on my list here, check to see if the plants need water.
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.860]  You can check visually.
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:30.300]  I can see if the plants look droopy at all, if they're starting to lean over, if the leaves
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.420]  are kind of hanging down.
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:32.540]  They need water.
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.700]  Or lift up the pot and check the weight.
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:38.620]  The standard way to do this is, think about it this way.
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:39.740]  Water your plant.
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.660]  Water it until it's full, freshly watered.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:43.180]  Pick it up and see how much it weighs.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.620]  That's its full weight.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:47.580]  When it weighs half of that, it's ready to be watered again.
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.980]  You need to pour in water and get it wet again.
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:52.380]  So second thing, check to see if the plants need water.
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:58.380]  The third thing I would do every single day, pull any dead leaves and put them in a trash
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:02.140]  bag or a trash can that gets removed from the garden area.
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.500]  I don't like to leave my trash bag or my trash can in the garden.
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.620]  That doesn't make sense to me.
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.740]  I want to get that out of there.
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:12.780]  One of the reasons being, I apologize for all the coughing and clearing over the throat.
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:13.820]  That'll end here pretty soon.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:15.660]  Took a couple of fat dabs.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:20.780]  The reason I like to get yellowing leaves out of the room is, bugs are attracted to
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:21.740]  yellow leaves.
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:24.300]  Bugs see yellow leaves as a perfect opportunity.
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:28.540]  The outer layer of the leaf has been softened and they can bite in and get to the juicy
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.700]  insides of the leaves a little more easily.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:31.580]  And bugs know that.
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:32.940]  So they're attracted to yellow leaves.
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.700]  That's why your sticky traps are yellow.
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.420]  So get all the yellow leaves out of there.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:38.940]  Put them in a trash can.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.300]  Put them in a trash bag and get them out of the room because those are going to attract
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:42.800]  bugs.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:45.180]  So get that shit away from there.
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:49.580]  The next thing I would recommend, check the clones in the domes for moisture.
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:52.780]  Check the humidity levels in your clones and check for roots.
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:54.460]  And if you've got roots, transplant them.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.900]  Put them into the next, if they're going into the next size rock, we'll put them into there.
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.300]  If they're going into cups with soil, throw them into there.
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:01.900]  If they've got roots, do whatever you need to do.
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:04.700]  If they need moisture or humidity, adjust that shit.
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:05.500]  Get in there and fix it.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.180]  You can fix the clone domes really easily.
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.900]  So the next thing to do, check the temps and the humidity of the room and adjust that.
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:17.820]  If necessary, you guys try to aim for 40 to 60% humidity during your bloom phase.
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:21.660]  And then during the veg phase, you can be around 60 to 70% humidity.
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:26.540]  I wouldn't go any higher than 70% humidity and try to have some airflow along with that,
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:27.980]  or you will get some issues.
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:32.300]  Try to keep the daytime temperature around 70 to 77 degrees.
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.660]  I really like 74 degrees.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.020]  Plants really like 74.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.460]  Some of the sativas like to get up to 77 during the day cycle.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:43.820]  During the night cycle, try to stay within 10 degrees of what your day cycle is.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:48.540]  So if during the day you're getting 77, at night you want to be at 67 or a little higher.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:51.500]  Don't go more than 10 degrees swing from day to night.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.900]  So during the day, 70 to 77.
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:58.860]  During the night, 60 to 65 degrees during your night cycle is what I try to aim for.
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.980]  Another thing that you need to do that a lot of people forget to do,
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:05.420]  and I can tell by your Instagram photos, sweep the damn floor.
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:09.500]  All you got to do is get a broom and a dustpan and a bucket and sweep the floor,
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:13.260]  scoop up that shit that you just swept up into a dustpan, dump it into the bucket,
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:17.420]  get it out of there and put it into a trash can and get it out of the house.
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.660]  All that shit on the floor, first of all, it looks terrible.
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:21.260]  Why do you want that shit on your floor in your grow room?
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:21.820]  It looks like shit.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:23.100]  Get the leaves off there.
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.460]  Get the dirt off there.
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:28.380]  Get that, I can't think of what that shit's called right now.
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:31.980]  That white stuff that sucks to step on, the perlite, get the perlite up off the floor.
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:33.740]  Just sweep up, you guys.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:34.460]  It's not that hard.
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:39.260]  Every leaf on the floor, every little piece of debris, that's a good spot for a bug to hide.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:45.100]  If you've got a problem with whiteflies, fungus gnats, spider mites, aphids, thrips,
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.180]  that's another spot for a bug to hide.
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:50.780]  One little tiny bug can hide under a leaf and lay so many eggs.
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.220]  Don't give them the opportunity, you guys.
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.940]  Fight the battle at your advantage.
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.540]  Don't give these bugs a place to go.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.420]  So sweep the floor.
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.540]  The next thing I would do, check any equipment.
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.740]  Check your hydro pumps.
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:02.940]  Check the EZ Cloner pumps.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:04.300]  Check your dehumidifiers.
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.020]  If you're running hydro, check your mix pump in your reservoir.
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.340]  I know a lot of guys have a big res filled with nutrients.
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.900]  You just put a pump in there to shoot the nutrients around.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:12.540]  Check that pump.
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.060]  Make sure it hasn't gotten clogged up.
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.220]  Those pumps have little filters on them.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:17.260]  They like to get gunky.
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:20.620]  If you're using any kind of feed system, check that thing.
[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:22.540]  Make sure your sprinklers haven't gotten clogged up.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:29.180]  If you've got an EZ Cloner, check the water level in that as well and refill it and adjust the pH.
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:34.700]  Also, the next thing you should do, check the pH and PPM levels if you're running any hydro.
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:40.460]  If you've got a flood and drain kit, if you're doing buckets or whatever, check your pH.
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:41.660]  Also, check your PPM.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:43.660]  You need to adjust your pH.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:45.980]  You need to adjust your PPMs almost every day.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:50.940]  I've seen large hydro gardens need to be topped off every day, if not twice a day,
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.740]  because of water evaporation and plant productivity.
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.900]  And every time that water evaporates and you add more water, you've got to adjust the pH.
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.940]  Check that shit out all the time, every day if you can,
[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:03.260]  twice a day if you can on that if you're running hydro.
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.980]  The hydro guys may have a little bit more work to do than us soil guys,
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.900]  but we've got a lot of soil and dirt to deal with.
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.060]  The work will kind of math out, I guess.
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:10.700]  I'm not sure.
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:14.460]  I haven't run a real hydro garden myself, so I can't speak correctly on that.
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:17.500]  It seems like you have a lot of cleaning and a lot of maintenance to do on a hydro grow.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:19.500]  What's next?
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:23.100]  Prune and train the plants and shape them the way you want them for your grow space.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.660]  That's something you can be working on every single day.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.740]  Keep in mind how you want those plants to be shaped.
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:30.380]  Get the architecture correct so that you have sturdy plants.
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.740]  Try to use up as much canopy space as you can with each plant.
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:35.820]  So prune and train your plants.
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.100]  Take off all the shitty leaves.
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.740]  Take off any little sucker leaves that are happening.
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:40.620]  Just get rid of that crap.
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:41.500]  Make the plants healthy.
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:42.560]  All right.
[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:44.300]  Excuse me.
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.900]  So the next step, lollipop any small crap while you're in flower.
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:51.500]  All those little tiny buds that are happening on the bottom, just cut that crap off.
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:53.980]  You can lollipop all the way up through week four.
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:55.740]  I've done it up into week five.
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:58.380]  Once you get the hang of it, you can really get carried away.
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:59.100]  You'll know what to cut off.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:07:59.900]  You'll know what to leave.
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:04.620]  So when you're new at it, only do it for the first couple of weeks, I guess, until you get the hang of it.
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:07.420]  And then once you've gotten a few crops under your belt that you've lollipopped,
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:10.140]  you'll be able to do it up into week four or five without pissing the plants off.
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:12.220]  I've done it too late and caused hermaphrodites.
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.020]  That's why I warn you to go light and then learn how to do it.
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.060]  So lollipop stuff.
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:17.740]  Take off all that small crap in flower.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.380]  Pull off any funky leaves while you're there.
[01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:23.500]  So the next thing that you can do every single day, you guys,
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.980]  take notes on everything you do.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.700]  Everything you do, just write down what you do.
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:31.420]  I run a large grow for Green and Healthy Wellness.
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:36.540]  Basically, the owner of Green and Healthy Wellness has put me in charge of the grow.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:37.660]  What I say goes.
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:41.980]  He doesn't ask me any questions as long as at the end of the harvest,
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:44.620]  there's our goal weight of quality flower.
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.900]  Nobody's going to fuck with me.
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:46.940]  And I'm going to reach that goal.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:51.820]  But the OCD person in me, the person that likes to be accountable,
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:54.460]  I make notes of everything I do all day, every day.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:57.340]  If I open up my phone, we could read exactly what I did.
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:00.700]  Not exactly, probably, but I mean, pretty close to every step I did today
[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:02.460]  from walking in and checking the clones,
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:05.420]  walking the rows and checking each plant, fixing the sprinklers.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:08.540]  Like I write down what I do every day just to keep accountability
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.620]  and to keep myself reminded of what's been done.
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:13.500]  So that if something goes wrong, I can look back on that and go,
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.380]  oh, look, it was right here.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.460]  When I mix this stupid shit together, I messed up.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:19.980]  Also, you guys, a good reason to take notes.
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.860]  This industry is expanding rapidly,
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:26.140]  and we're going to have marijuana available in every state before too long.
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.940]  When states start legalizing cannabis and it's time to hire professional growers,
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:33.900]  you guys that took good notes of all your grows,
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:35.820]  you guys are going to have a portfolio,
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:39.660]  basically an application or a resume right there on paper.
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:41.100]  You can say, look, I took notes.
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:42.700]  So that shows that you're organized.
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.980]  It shows that you're accountable.
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:45.100]  It shows that you're planning.
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.460]  It shows that you're thinking.
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:47.980]  It shows that you're serious.
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:49.420]  All the other guys are going to be able to say,
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:51.980]  well, I grew this much weed in my mom's basement,
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:55.180]  and they're not going to have any pictures or any notes or anything like that.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.220]  So you guys are taking notes.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.980]  You're going to have the advantage there.
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.060]  So take notes on everything you do.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:01.020]  I talk about that a lot,
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.500]  but it's something that I think is really serious in a cannabis grow.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:07.020]  What if you do something different this time and it comes out perfect?
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.380]  You're going to want to know what you did.
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:11.340]  The only way your dumb high ass is going to remember is if you wrote it down
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.700]  because you're smoking too much good weed,
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.300]  because you're growing too much good weed.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.580]  So write shit down.
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:19.500]  And that is my weekly or my daily to do checklist.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.940]  I'm now going to move on to weekly.
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:23.340]  So this is stuff that you should be handling once a week.
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:25.980]  I like to pick Mondays and just kick Monday's ass.
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:27.500]  I get all the chores done on Monday.
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:29.260]  And then through the rest of the week,
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:32.540]  you can just focus on the plants and keeping everything clean and doing all that stuff.
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:34.540]  So every Monday, this is what I would do.
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:38.140]  I would start each week with a well-planned feed in each room.
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:39.740]  If you've got a clone area,
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:42.700]  if they've got water in trays or in a corner,
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.180]  dump that water out, put fresh water in there,
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.620]  fresh nutrients, whatever you're using.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.700]  If you're using A and B in the cloner,
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:50.620]  or if you're using Rapid Start,
[01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:52.140]  or if you're using Clonex, whatever,
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:53.900]  put fresh solution in your cloner,
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:57.180]  get it going fresh on Monday or whatever day you choose to start.
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:59.660]  But once a week, clean that sucker out and get it going fresh.
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:02.300]  Also water all of your veg plants,
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:06.060]  feed your veg plants with a strong nutrient solution on Monday.
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:08.540]  If they're little babies, maybe just some A and B.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.100]  If they're getting a little bigger, maybe throw a little liquid karma in there.
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.140]  If they're getting even bigger,
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:15.100]  maybe they want some potassium silicates and maybe some cow mag in there.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:19.900]  You should definitely be feeding your veg plants a little bit of root inoculate also.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:20.860]  Get those roots going.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:25.820]  So also feed your flowering plants a well-planned feed each week.
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:28.540]  If it's time to flush, you need to start flushing.
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.940]  That's another good reason to take notes.
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:31.980]  Then you know when to flush.
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:35.020]  If you guys need help planning your feeding,
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:37.820]  I did an episode all about feeding your flowering plants.
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:42.940]  Episode number 69 will give you a weekly schedule
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:44.860]  of what to feed your plants while they're in flowers.
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:47.100]  If you want to check that out, that may be useful for you.
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:51.500]  Every week, feed your plants a well-planned feed.
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.940]  The next thing I would do every week is dust all of the fans.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:57.020]  Those fans get dirty.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:58.780]  Just dust the backs of them off.
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:01.260]  If you want to take off the screen and clean the blades every week,
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:02.540]  that would be super cool of you.
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:04.380]  Your room would appreciate it.
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:08.060]  All of that dust is going to end up in your dabs if you don't clean the fan.
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.340]  Think of it that way.
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:13.420]  The next thing I would do, check the timers for proper time and function.
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:16.540]  Be there when the lights come on a couple of times a week.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:19.180]  I know you can't be there all the time when the lights come on,
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:20.780]  but if you can, try to be there.
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:23.500]  If the lights come on at nine o'clock, just be standing outside of the room
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:28.060]  like 857 so that when the lights click on, you can hear it go click,
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:29.420]  and then you can open the door.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:33.180]  You can make sure the timer is working and then be there again when the lights go off.
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:36.460]  Just check the timers for proper time and proper function.
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.820]  Every week, I would calibrate your meters.
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:42.300]  If you've got a pH meter, you should have one of those.
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:43.260]  Calibrate it.
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.580]  Get the four, the seven, and the 10 solution,
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:47.340]  and just calibrate that thing once a week.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:53.180]  If you're a small-time grower and you have a hydro store near you that you frequent,
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:55.740]  they will probably calibrate your pH meter for you.
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:57.660]  They'll be nice and do that as a courtesy.
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:58.860]  Calibrate your pH meter.
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.900]  You should also have a PPM meter.
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:05.340]  Calibrate that as frequently as you can at least once a week.
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:07.820]  That can make a huge difference in the quality of your flowers.
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:11.420]  If you're measuring something and your meter is telling you that it's at seven,
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:15.020]  but it's actually at five and you're adjusting to get to six, five,
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:17.420]  you're actually going to be adjusting down into the fours,
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.340]  and you're really going to cause problems.
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:20.540]  Calibrate your meters, you guys.
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:25.020]  The next thing I would do at least once a week is check all your blowers and fans
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:27.740]  and make sure that they're not clogged or restricted in any way.
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.700]  Most of the time, this can be done visually.
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:33.580]  You can look around the room and see that everything is working.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:36.220]  Maybe put your hand, if you've got a big vortex blower,
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:39.580]  just put your hand on the outside of the vortex blower and feel it vibrate.
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:40.140]  Listen to it.
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:42.940]  You'll know if some shit's wrong, but just pay attention to that stuff.
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.340]  If it's clogged up, that could be a fire hazard.
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:47.820]  If it's clogged up, that is going to cause you electricity
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:51.020]  because that fan is spinning and you're not getting blowing out of it,
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:54.060]  but you're using electricity because it's spinning and trying to break free
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.980]  from that hair clog or whatever you've got in there,
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.740]  or those leaves that are clogged in there.
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.020]  Just check those out.
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.980]  Guys, before you go sticking your fingers in any blowers,
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:04.620]  unplug them and give them a long time to quit spinning.
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:08.540]  They spin for a long time and just the natural force of those fans
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:11.820]  spinning on their own weight, that's enough to put a nice cut on your finger.
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:13.020]  So watch your fucking fingers.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.340]  Those blowers, I've cut myself on a blower before.
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:16.780]  It sucks more than you would ever know.
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:18.220]  Take it from me.
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.180]  There's blood, sweat, and tears in my garden and that's where the blood came from.
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:23.900]  So the next thing, guys, visually check the duct work
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:25.900]  and make sure that everything is sealed up.
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.220]  We're blowing a lot of pressure through these ducts
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:30.220]  where the ducting connects to the lights,
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.820]  where the ducting connects to the blower,
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:34.540]  where the ducting runs out of whatever room you're using.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:36.300]  Just make sure that all that stuff is sealed.
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:38.620]  Also, clean your air stones.
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:41.020]  If you're making any kind of teas or running any hydro,
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:42.860]  or if you've got cloners with air stones,
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:46.620]  or if you've just got water sitting there to get bubbled to get the chlorine out,
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:47.740]  clean the air stones, you guys.
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:48.860]  Those things get murky.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.100]  Sometimes you might just want to throw them away and replace them.
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:52.540]  They are not that expensive.
[01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:55.020]  If you've got a few bucks, just go buy new ones.
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:58.780]  The next thing, clean your dehumidifier or humidifier filter.
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:03.020]  In Colorado, we probably don't even have a dehumidifier in most rooms.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.540]  We use a humidifier in some places, but clean those filters.
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:08.620]  They get funky. That shit gets dirty.
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:11.420]  Anything that has water running through it frequently needs to be cleaned.
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.100]  It'll get gross. Just clean your shit.
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:17.660]  If you're running hydro, clean out your reservoir every week to 10 days
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:19.900]  and start with fresh water and fresh nutrients.
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:24.140]  Well, like I keep saying, water that sits around, that gets old, gets gross.
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:25.660]  Shit's able to grow in there.
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.020]  Things can colonize in there.
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:29.820]  You don't want that. You want fresh stuff.
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:31.820]  If you're running easy cloners, do the same.
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:33.100]  Flush out those easy cloners.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.380]  I talked about that a minute ago.
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:38.060]  Just dump it out, fill it with fresh water, fresh nutrients, pH it,
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:39.340]  and get it going all over again.
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:40.620]  Your plants will love you for it.
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:42.540]  You don't want to drink old funky water, do you?
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:45.420]  You don't even leave your dog's bowl sitting there for too long
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.620]  without putting fresh water in it.
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:47.900]  Don't do that to your plants.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:49.260]  Love your plants. They're family too.
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:53.020]  Something you're going to need to think about weekly.
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:57.180]  You need to dispose of your grow room trash carefully.
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:59.980]  When the trash man comes, you're going to want to,
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:02.380]  I would wait until the morning and take the trash out
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.660]  till when you know he's coming.
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:06.060]  Don't leave that trash sitting out there on the curb overnight.
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:10.220]  If it's out there on the curb, your trash is accessible to the public
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:14.700]  and it is legal for police officers, neighborhood kids,
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:19.340]  hungry homeless people, curious neighbors, whoever, private investigators,
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:22.620]  anybody can walk up to your trash and look through your shit
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:23.820]  and they can take it if they want.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.180]  Those guys stole my trash.
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:26.380]  Yeah, they can do that. They really can.
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:28.220]  Sorry, if you don't know what I'm talking about, I apologize.
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:28.940]  That was kind of cheesy.
[01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:32.620]  But your trash is fair game if it's out there on the curb.
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:34.620]  And if you've got a whole bunch of leaves in there
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:37.420]  and you live in a state that is not legal to produce cannabis,
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:38.620]  you could have a crime.
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:40.140]  That could be evidence of a crime right there.
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:41.020]  So be careful.
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:43.500]  Dispose of your grow room trash very carefully.
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:46.700]  If you're doing a large grow, take it to the dump yourself.
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:48.300]  The guys at the dump don't give a shit.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.140]  Just take it to the dump, have it in big trash bags.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:50.940]  Just go drop it off.
[01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.780]  They don't care that you're dropping off weed leaves.
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:54.700]  Those guys have their own business going on.
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:57.260]  So dispose of your grow room trash carefully.
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:59.420]  Another thing I would recommend doing weekly,
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:02.620]  look around the grow room, look on the walls and the ceiling
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:05.740]  and the floors and look for any mold or moisture.
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:08.140]  If you've got condensation happening somewhere,
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.660]  figure out why that's happening.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:10.380]  Correct it.
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:13.420]  If you've got any mold, I've seen blue mold form
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:14.460]  on the walls and grow rooms.
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:17.260]  I've seen little green mold form on the walls and grow rooms.
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:18.940]  Clean that shit up, get rid of it.
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:23.020]  Use H2O2, use bleach, use peroxide, use something strong.
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:25.180]  If you want to go organic, do that, do your thing,
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:26.300]  but clean that shit up.
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.580]  That is unhealthy for you.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:28.780]  It's unhealthy for the plants.
[01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:31.900]  Figure out why it's happening and resolve the issue
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:32.940]  to make it not happen.
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:35.180]  Once you've cleaned it, you've got to figure out what caused it
[01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.180]  and stop it from happening or it'll just come back.
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:38.060]  Mold is a bitch.
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:38.940]  You can clean mold.
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.260]  I saw somebody clean mold off of a wall.
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:42.300]  They had a spot.
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:43.900]  Let's say it was about the size of a quarter,
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:45.340]  maybe a 50 cent piece.
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:47.740]  And she scrubbed the mold with bleach and hot water.
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.020]  And she called me the next day and she's like,
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:49.420]  come over here.
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.220]  I want you to see this.
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:54.780]  And I walked into that mold and formed into like a four by four square.
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.340]  It just grew that much in like 24 hours.
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:58.140]  It was so ridiculous.
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:00.460]  So if you've got mold, figure out what's causing it,
[01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:01.180]  clean the shit out of it.
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:02.940]  You may need to call a professional eventually.
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:05.420]  Don't ruin our rental home, growing weed.
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:09.020]  God, I apologize for clearing the throat so much in this episode,
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.340]  but I've got a whole bunch of good dabs from the Terp station.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:12.780]  So a shout out to Terpex.
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.620]  You can blame all the throat clearing on Jordan.
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.020]  That sounded grosser than it was meant to,
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:18.220]  but there we go.
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.460]  So that's everything that you should do.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:22.620]  In my opinion, stuff that you should do weekly.
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.020]  I'm going to move on to things that you should do monthly.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:28.300]  If you're running hydro or if you have a feed system,
[01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.700]  I recommend that you clean the lines out some way.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:33.180]  Who recommended it to me?
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.020]  I remember who said it, Shane.
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:36.380]  It was our friend Shane.
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:39.500]  Shane recommended that you use an air compressor
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:43.020]  to clean out the lines of your hydro system to blow out any clogs.
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:44.620]  So if you've got a feed system,
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:47.020]  you've got a hydro system, clean that shit out.
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.940]  If you've got little sprinklers, clean those out.
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.860]  If you've got drippers, clean those out.
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:53.180]  You might have to hand poke them.
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:54.780]  You might have to get something pokey
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:57.260]  and just hand poke each little hole out by hand,
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:58.460]  but you need them clean.
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.580]  So clean the shit out of those.
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:03.180]  Monthly, clean your air conditioner filters.
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:05.020]  That's something that needs to be done monthly.
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.300]  Also, test your smoke detectors.
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.780]  You should have smoke detectors in your grow rooms.
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:12.460]  Yes, you don't want that shit burning down.
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:14.540]  If it catches on fire, you want a heads up.
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:16.780]  Test your smoke detectors.
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:18.220]  Replace the battery if necessary.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.100]  That should be obvious.
[01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:22.780]  There's nothing like hearing beep, beep all the time
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:25.340]  when you're growing and the damn battery is trying to die.
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:26.380]  That's the worst sound ever.
[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:27.580]  I don't know how anyone can live with that.
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:29.740]  Another thing you should do every month,
[01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:31.980]  clean the glass in your reflectors, you guys.
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:34.940]  This may need to be done more or less often,
[01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:36.300]  depending on your style.
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:39.260]  If you're spraying in there, if you're using a foliar spray,
[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:41.500]  that shit's going to probably end up a little bit
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.500]  on the reflectors unless you're careful.
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:44.780]  If you're spraying bug sprays,
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.300]  it's going to end up on the light reflectors.
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.660]  Clean that glass.
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:48.460]  Just clean it out.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.580]  If you can, slide the glass out, clean the inside.
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:53.660]  Sometimes your carbon filter blows a little bit of carbon
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:54.300]  in there.
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:55.900]  Just clean that stuff up.
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:58.380]  You're paying for the light to shine.
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:19:59.500]  It's taking electricity.
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.620]  The light is shining.
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:03.500]  Don't put a dirty lens between the light and the plants
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.020]  that you're trying to put the light on.
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:06.940]  It just makes more sense to clean it.
[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:09.100]  You're paying full price no matter what you do.
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:10.460]  So clean that shit.
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:12.140]  And speaking of paying full price, the next step.
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:13.500]  These may sound like no brainers,
[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:17.900]  but pay your electricity and water bills every month, you guys.
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:20.620]  You should be okay running a whole bunch of electricity
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:21.660]  and using a whole bunch of water.
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:23.100]  But the first time you miss a bill,
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:24.060]  they're going to come fuck with you.
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.020]  They're going to knock on your door.
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.060]  They're going to want their money.
[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:27.180]  And that's when shit can go wrong.
[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:28.220]  So pay your bills.
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:30.060]  Don't ever try to ditch out on a grow bill.
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.140]  Don't ever steal electricity.
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:33.420]  Don't ever steal water.
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:34.380]  Just pay your bills.
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.420]  It should be a no brainer.
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:36.860]  Most of the people that listen to this show
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:39.580]  should already be doing that, but don't ever steal.
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.660]  If you do get caught stealing electricity or water,
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:43.580]  the government, I think here,
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:47.020]  I was told that they're able to charge you threefold
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:47.980]  for what you use.
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:49.740]  So if you use $100 in electricity
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:50.780]  and you get caught stealing it,
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:53.740]  they can charge you $300 just because you stole it.
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:54.380]  So pay up front.
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:55.100]  Don't be a dick.
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:55.820]  It's well worth it.
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:57.020]  All right.
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.460]  That's my stuff you should do monthly.
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:02.140]  I'm going to move into things that you should do every harvest.
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:04.460]  Every harvest, you're going to need to dispose
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:07.580]  of your sticks and leaves that you have left over.
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:09.420]  There's going to be a bunch of sticks and a bunch of leaves
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:10.700]  and a bunch of trim.
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:11.580]  Not the small trim.
[01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:12.460]  You want to make cash out of that,
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:14.060]  but like a bunch of trim crap
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:15.420]  that you don't want laying around.
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:16.780]  You need to get rid of that.
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:18.860]  Like I said, don't go throwing that in the trash
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:19.820]  and just leaving it out there.
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:21.740]  You might want to wait for the trash guy to come.
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:24.460]  You might want to find a friend who has a construction site
[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:26.220]  and get permission to throw your trash in there.
[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:27.980]  Don't go using someone's dumpster
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:29.580]  because if you get caught doing that,
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.020]  that's a fine for throwing your trash
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:32.140]  into somebody else's shit.
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:33.820]  And then they'll want to see what you threw in there.
[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:35.500]  And then this cop's looking at you
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.180]  and your big ass bag of weed leaves.
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:39.500]  And then you're trying to figure out a story.
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:42.460]  So figure out a clever way, a safe way,
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.700]  a smart way to get rid of all your sticks and leaves.
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:47.580]  Also dispose of or compost
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.900]  or recycle all of your soil carefully.
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:51.980]  You don't want to be in the backyard
[01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:53.100]  dumping out your old pots
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:55.660]  and then your backyard ends up full of perlite
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:56.860]  and it's all white and speckly
[01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:58.060]  and the dirt doesn't look right.
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:59.100]  You can't be that guy.
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:01.660]  So you have to figure out a way to either dispose of
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:03.980]  or recycle all of that soil that you use.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.180]  Recycling soil isn't as hard as you would imagine.
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:08.300]  It just needs to be reamended
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:09.500]  and kind of stirred around.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.660]  And then you can definitely use that soil again.
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.500]  So figure out a way to do that.
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.580]  I've done a little bit of talking about that on the show.
[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:18.220]  I'm still experimenting with it myself.
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:19.180]  So once I get good at it,
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:21.420]  I'll do a full episode on recycling soil.
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:23.180]  I made a little note about that.
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:24.380]  So yeah, you're going to have to learn
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:26.220]  how to get rid of a bunch of dirt.
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.380]  You're going to have sticks and stuff.
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:29.020]  Get rid of that.
[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:30.300]  You're also, if you're running hydro,
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:32.380]  you're going to have rock wool cubes
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:35.740]  or you're going to have those hydroton clay pellets.
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:37.100]  I hate those things.
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:39.100]  You're going to have to get rid of that shit too somehow.
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:41.820]  I'm pretty sure you can recycle the rock wool cubes,
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:43.020]  the hydroton pellets.
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:44.940]  You can rinse them off and use them again.
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:45.980]  You can clean them,
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:47.500]  but eventually you got to throw those away
[01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:48.540]  because they get funky.
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:49.660]  So don't just go throw,
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:52.300]  don't go throwing those into your trash.
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:55.580]  Make sure you get rid of those safely and smartly.
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:56.220]  Smartly a word?
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:56.860]  I think so.
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:57.360]  It is now.
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:22:59.340]  Also clean your pots, you guys.
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:01.020]  Every harvest, you should clean your pots.
[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:03.660]  You should also clean your hydro trays.
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:05.580]  If you've got a four by four botanic care tray
[01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.180]  or one of those four by eight trays,
[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:08.220]  you should clean those things.
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:09.100]  And you're going to think I'm crazy,
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:10.860]  but here's how I recommend you do it.
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:11.500]  Throw it in the truck
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.260]  and just take them right to the carwash
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:15.020]  and just line the pots up against the wall
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:16.380]  and just spray the shit out of them.
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:18.380]  It's Colorado here.
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.580]  Everybody knows what you're doing.
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:20.780]  Just go spray your shit down.
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:21.340]  Nobody cares.
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:22.300]  The hydro trays,
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.660]  lean it up against the side of the truck,
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:24.700]  spray the shit out of it,
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:26.540]  throw it in the back of the truck, take it home.
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.500]  If you're in another state,
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:28.860]  that may be kind of weird,
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:29.900]  but if cannabis is legal,
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:31.420]  just take them to the carwash and hose them down.
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:32.300]  Don't use any soap.
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:33.500]  Don't use the carwashing soap.
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:34.380]  Don't wax them.
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:35.500]  Just use hot water on them
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:36.460]  with the high pressure thing
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:37.500]  and just spray the shit out of them.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.380]  It works really well.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:41.660]  So once you've got your pots cleaned,
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:43.260]  I recommend you clean the room
[01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:44.780]  thoroughly from top to bottom.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:46.460]  I said earlier, use H2O2,
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:48.380]  use bleach, use hydrogen peroxide.
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.140]  There are a thousand other products
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:50.780]  I could say to use,
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:52.300]  but use something to get in there
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:53.420]  and sanitize the room.
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:55.100]  Don't just clean it up, sanitize it.
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:56.860]  Our good friend, Mike,
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:58.540]  helps me out when it's time to clean the room.
[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:00.700]  Mike and I dress up in our little
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:01.820]  let's get clean suits.
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:04.220]  It's basically just our shittiest clothes we have.
[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:06.220]  Put bandanas on our faces,
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:07.740]  put our hair in crazy hats,
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:10.540]  go down in there and just clean everything.
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:11.500]  And by the time we're done,
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.500]  you can eat off the floor of my girl rooms
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:14.700]  when they're freshly started.
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:15.900]  It is so gorgeous in there.
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:17.420]  Since I'm talking about Mike,
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:18.380]  I want to give him a shout out.
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.100]  We recorded a podcast last night
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:23.180]  and the recording sounded like shit.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:25.020]  Something went wrong in the recording software
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.940]  and everything sounded like robots.
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:28.940]  It sounded like R2-D2 and Darth Vader
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:30.860]  and B8 having conversations.
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:32.380]  So I just deleted that.
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:34.140]  I apologize to Mike for that podcast.
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:35.660]  Never making it to the air,
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:36.780]  but you know he'll be back.
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:37.820]  Mike, you'll be back, bro.
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:39.660]  I'm sorry that did not work,
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:40.860]  but you'll get over here.
[01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:42.300]  You got to come dab and hang out anyway.
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:43.420]  So thanks for coming
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:45.020]  and let's get back into the show.
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.540]  Sanitize your room every harvest.
[01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.180]  That's what I was saying.
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.340]  Also clean the floors and the walls
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:50.300]  and the ceiling, you guys.
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:52.780]  Wipe them down, scrub them down.
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:55.100]  The ceiling gets funky.
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:55.660]  You're in there.
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:56.780]  It's humid.
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.220]  You're in there spraying pesticides.
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:00.060]  You're in there spraying foliar sprays.
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.900]  So that puts moisture everywhere.
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:02.780]  Then it gets humid.
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:03.580]  Water rises.
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.660]  The ceiling is going to get funkier
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:06.700]  than you're going to assume.
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:07.580]  So just scrub it.
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:08.620]  You'll think it's clean.
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:09.580]  You'll hit it with the rag
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.580]  and you realize it is not clean.
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.020]  The walls, obviously,
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:14.300]  same thing with the foliar spray.
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:15.580]  Same thing with the humidity
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:16.300]  and the floors.
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.420]  Everything lands on the floor.
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:18.860]  You spilled nutrients there.
[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:19.900]  You've been walking there.
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:20.940]  It's just filthy.
[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:21.820]  Clean that shit.
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:24.620]  Also inspect any seals you've made.
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.780]  If you've sealed up any windows or doors
[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:27.820]  or anything like that.
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:29.180]  If you've put caulking somewhere,
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:29.820]  re-caulk it.
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:31.180]  If you've taped it, re-tape it.
[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:33.100]  Also, if you've put up,
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.300]  I put up HEPA filters.
[01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:37.420]  So if I've got a wall between two rooms
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.660]  and I'm pulling air from one room to the other,
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:40.380]  I just go to Lowe's
[01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:42.140]  and buy those little square HEPA filters
[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:43.980]  and I just cut them kind of close to the shape I want
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:45.500]  and just staple them to the wall.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.980]  I replace those every time,
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:48.860]  every harvest also.
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:50.540]  I try to because they get dusty.
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:51.260]  They get dirty,
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:53.340]  but they keep all the funk out of the room.
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:55.260]  So just go ahead and replace those.
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:56.460]  That's always a good idea.
[01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:58.620]  Just those little square HEPA filters.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.980]  You can find them at Lowe's.
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:00.940]  If you can't find those,
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:01.660]  just use like a,
[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:03.740]  any kind of filter will work for you.
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:04.940]  It's just better than having the hole
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:06.300]  where the air is moving open.
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:07.500]  You just want to put a filter over there
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.340]  to catch the dirt or any bugs
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:10.940]  or anything that may be trying to move around,
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:12.780]  trying to migrate from place to place.
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:13.340]  All right.
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:14.140]  So yearly,
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.820]  here are a couple of things
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:17.100]  that I think you should do
[01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:19.340]  every single year as a grower.
[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:21.180]  Oh, I forgot to mention every harvest.
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:22.860]  That little sleeve
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:24.380]  that goes around your carbon filter,
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:26.220]  take that off and clean it
[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:27.180]  and put it back on
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:28.860]  and good luck not getting carbon everywhere
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:30.380]  the next time you turn on your carbon filter.
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:31.500]  There are tons of tricks on that.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.420]  Here's what I'm talking about.
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.540]  When you use a carbon filter,
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:35.420]  every time you move it,
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:37.180]  you jar the carbon inside
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.460]  and then you put a blower on there
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:39.500]  and you plug in the blower
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:40.860]  to start blowing the air
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:42.540]  through the filter just to use it.
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:44.140]  And then all that carbon you've just stirred
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:45.820]  goes flying through all of your lights
[01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:46.780]  and into your grow room.
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:49.580]  You've got to get,
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:50.620]  you've got to figure out a smart way
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:51.420]  to catch that carbon.
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:53.740]  What I do is I blow it into a,
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:55.420]  I've got a,
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:55.820]  it's a,
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:56.220]  what is it?
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:56.860]  I know what it is.
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:57.660]  I can't think of the brand.
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:58.700]  It's a Crown Royal bag
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:26:59.660]  because the Crown Royal bag
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:00.460]  will let the air out,
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:02.140]  but it'll catch all of the particulate
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:03.020]  that's coming through.
[01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:04.620]  So I just put the ducting
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:05.500]  into a Crown Royal bag
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:06.460]  and hold it and then plug it in.
[01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:07.260]  Then it blows into there
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:08.460]  for a couple of seconds.
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:09.500]  And then I just pull that off
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:09.980]  and seal it up
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:11.420]  and I've caught all the carbon in there.
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:12.140]  So that's a trick,
[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:14.620]  a really weird random trick
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:16.780]  to keep all the carbon from blowing out
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:18.140]  when you've got a new carbon filter.
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:19.180]  So take that little cover off,
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:19.420]  you guys,
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:20.540]  it comes with a sleeve.
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:21.180]  Take that off,
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:21.820]  clean it.
[01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:22.540]  It looks like shit
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:23.660]  when it's all dusty anyway.
[01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:24.780]  You want that white and clean,
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:25.340]  clean it up,
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:26.860]  put some oxy clean in the water,
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:28.380]  get that sucker white again.
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:29.900]  So yearly, here's where we are.
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:32.220]  Yearly, replace your carbon filter.
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:33.260]  The guy at the hydro shop
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:33.820]  swears to me
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:34.700]  that my carbon filters
[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:35.900]  are going to last two years.
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:36.620]  They do not.
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:39.740]  There was a guy replacing a,
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:40.860]  what's it called?
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:42.380]  A transformer in my backyard
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:43.260]  a couple of weeks ago.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:44.700]  And he told me,
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:45.340]  sir, it smells like
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:46.620]  you got a skunk back here.
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:47.980]  There were no skunks back there.
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:49.500]  That was a little bit of
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.420]  grateful dog crossed a space queen
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:52.220]  and it was stinking up
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:52.940]  the whole neighborhood
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:53.820]  because my carbon filter
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:54.860]  needed to be replaced.
[01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.780]  I've got a new one sitting there now.
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:58.460]  As soon as I rebuild the room,
[01:27:58.460 --> 01:27:59.500]  I'll have a fresh filter.
[01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:00.620]  The neighbors will quit smelling
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.380]  the candy scented skunks.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.580]  So replace your carbon filter.
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:04.780]  They only last about a year.
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:06.620]  Another thing that you should do
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:07.500]  every year, you guys
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:10.140]  have your fire extinguisher
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:13.180]  checked and replaced or charged.
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:14.140]  They've got a little red,
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:15.820]  yellow and green gauge on them.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:17.580]  You want it all the way in the green.
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:18.780]  If it starts to get to yellow,
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:19.980]  it's not reliable anymore
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:21.260]  and you need a new fire extinguisher.
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:21.820]  You neither.
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:23.260]  You either need to go get it charged
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:24.140]  or just buy a new one.
[01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:24.940]  They sell them at Lowe's.
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:25.900]  They sell them at Home Depot.
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:26.780]  They're not expensive.
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.020]  They're hopefully you never need it.
[01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:30.140]  I really hope you never need it.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:31.900]  But if you do, you want it fully charged.
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:33.900]  Always have a fire extinguisher
[01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:34.860]  near your grow.
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:35.660]  I've got one.
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:36.700]  I've got a bedroom.
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:38.060]  I've got a flowering room.
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:40.060]  There's a fire extinguisher
[01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:41.020]  hanging on the outside
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:42.140]  of my flowering room.
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:43.100]  Have it on the outside.
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:43.740]  If something goes,
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:44.860]  if you hear that smoke alarm
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:46.060]  and they're going off,
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:47.260]  grab the fire extinguisher,
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:48.620]  check the door for heat.
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:49.740]  If it's stupid hot,
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:50.620]  you have a decision to make.
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:51.980]  Do you want to open that door or not?
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:53.500]  Open that door,
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:54.140]  hit that fucker
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:55.100]  with the fire extinguisher
[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:56.060]  that you've already got in your hand.
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:56.860]  You don't want to open the door
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:57.340]  and run in there
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:58.620]  and find the fire extinguisher
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:00.460]  in the smoky, hot, fiery room.
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:01.660]  So have it on the outside.
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:03.020]  And I really, I pray to Jah
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:03.900]  that you never have to use
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:04.780]  your fire extinguisher,
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:06.380]  but I'd rather you have it and it work.
[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:09.740]  And I'd rather you be safe
[01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:11.180]  than this thing fail on you.
[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:13.100]  So I've got another fire extinguisher
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:14.540]  right just outside the bedroom.
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:16.540]  Also, just that's where shit can go wrong.
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:17.340]  There are a lot of lights,
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:18.460]  a lot of electricity.
[01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:19.980]  Just want to be a responsible grower.
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:20.860]  Try to be responsible.
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:22.860]  So get your fire extinguisher
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:25.100]  inspected and replaced once a year.
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:27.420]  And I think that's all I've got
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:29.500]  for the checklist, you guys.
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:30.300]  I really want to thank
[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:31.420]  all my friends on Facebook.
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:33.020]  I posted to Facebook
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:34.220]  asking for some updates
[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:35.740]  and a lot of people contributed.
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:36.620]  So many of you that I'm not
[01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:37.820]  even going to try to list everybody.
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:39.580]  So shout out to my Facebook community
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:40.220]  that helped out.
[01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:41.740]  I truly appreciate that.
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.180]  There's some things I did leave out.
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:44.940]  I understand that things got left out here.
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:46.700]  You'll need to work
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:47.980]  on a pest management system.
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:48.700]  You'll need to integrate
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:50.140]  that into this checklist somehow.
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:51.900]  If you don't see any issues,
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:53.580]  you can simply spray once a week
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:55.500]  with an organic application,
[01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:56.540]  whatever you want to use.
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:59.500]  I use Azimax if there's no problems.
[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:00.140]  I just use like,
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:01.580]  since I travel from so many gardens,
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:03.340]  I hit my plants once a week with Azimax
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:04.140]  when they're in veg,
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:05.340]  just to make sure that I don't bring
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:06.300]  anything home from all
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.820]  the other gardens I play in.
[01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:09.340]  If you see any issues in your garden,
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:11.820]  you may need to increase the frequency
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:12.860]  and the potency of
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:13.900]  whatever you're spraying.
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:15.900]  Maybe change the active ingredient
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:17.500]  to something a little bit stronger.
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:19.340]  Hopefully you don't get any pests
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:20.700]  if you're doing something preventative,
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:21.340]  but that's something
[01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:22.540]  you'll have to work into
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:23.820]  this regimen here as well.
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.380]  There's also going to be a point in time
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:27.340]  where you're going to need
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:29.100]  to change your light bulbs.
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.700]  We did another episode on that.
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:31.820]  Every bulb is different.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:33.020]  Every garden is different.
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:35.420]  We talked about swapping out
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:37.420]  your thousand watt HPS bulbs
[01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:39.980]  about every one to three harvests.
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:40.940]  I've heard people using them
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:41.980]  for a full year.
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:43.420]  I've heard people using them for a while.
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:45.100]  Just like I said earlier,
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:47.100]  when your bulbs start diminishing,
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:48.300]  your eyes won't notice it,
[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:49.740]  but your plants will,
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:51.020]  and you're still paying
[01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:52.140]  for all of the electricity.
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:53.820]  If you've got a thousand watt bulb
[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:55.180]  and it's like six months old,
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.380]  it's probably only putting out
[01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:58.140]  60 to 70% of its output,
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.820]  but you're paying for 100%
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:02.540]  of that thousand watts to be running.
[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:03.980]  So go upgrade your bulbs.
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:05.900]  It doesn't cost that much money.
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:07.660]  If you think about how much herb
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:09.420]  you're going to grow from a fresh bulb,
[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:10.300]  the difference,
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:11.740]  the cost of that bulb
[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:13.260]  should definitely be worth it.
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.460]  So that's what I've got for you
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:15.900]  on a checklist of things
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:17.740]  that you should be doing in your garden.
[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:19.340]  Don't be shy to send me
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:20.300]  things that I missed.
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:20.860]  If there's something
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:21.820]  you want to add to this,
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:23.500]  if there's something I did wrong,
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:24.300]  let me know.
[01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:25.180]  I want to hear from you.
[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:26.620]  No matter what you've got to say,
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:27.580]  send me an email.
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:29.340]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.380]  You can find me on Twitter.
[01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:32.460]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:33.900]  You can hit me up on Facebook.
[01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:36.060]  It's simply Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:37.500]  If you know my personal Facebook,
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:38.780]  you can find me there.
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:39.420]  If you know me,

[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:41.420]  you can call me,
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:42.220]  tell me whatever you want
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:43.500]  to tell me about the podcast,
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:44.220]  but I'd love to hear
[01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:46.140]  what you think of this garden checklist.
[01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:47.020]  If there's something I missed,
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:47.500]  let me know.
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:48.460]  We'll do a part two.
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:49.980]  Make sure you guys
[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:51.260]  check out the next podcast.
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:52.940]  It will feature Kabuki J Fox
[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.060]  and it will be recorded live
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:55.100]  from the Cana Canyon.
[01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:56.860]  So big shout out to Kabuki J Fox
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:59.100]  of Foxtracks and the Cana Canyon
[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:00.460]  in Colorado Springs.
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:01.900]  Don't forget to check out
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.420]  our sponsor, you guys, Hitman Glass.
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:05.100]  Big shout out to Hitman Glass.
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:07.580]  I've got a brand new Hitman short stack.
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:09.420]  I really can't do this justice
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:11.020]  if I tried to describe it
[01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:12.780]  with words on a microphone.
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:14.780]  It's five disc perks
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:16.540]  stacked on top of each other
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:18.700]  and they are welded together
[01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:20.380]  with what's called a Jesus seal.
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:21.900]  There are three Jesus seals
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:24.460]  holding each perk together.
[01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:27.100]  The discs are actually donuts
[01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:27.900]  and there is a tube
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:29.420]  that goes down the middle
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:30.540]  and it's got a hammerhead.
[01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:32.140]  So there's a down stem
[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:33.020]  that goes into the rig.
[01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:34.540]  It's got a hammerhead perk.
[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:36.140]  When you smoke through it,
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.460]  the water goes up through each disc
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:40.700]  and then it goes to the top disc
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:41.820]  where there is a drain
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:43.420]  that goes down back to the bottom
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:44.060]  through the center.
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:45.740]  I know I just confused
[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:46.540]  the shit out of your head,
[01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:47.500]  but I will post a picture
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:48.220]  of this to Instagram
[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:49.660]  so that you can check it out.
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:50.860]  A huge, huge shout out
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:52.220]  to my friends at Hitman Glass.
[01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:54.220]  Make sure you follow them on Instagram.
[01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:55.820]  Let them know that you heard about them
[01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.660]  from the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:32:57.660 --> 01:32:59.980]  We would all appreciate that.
[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:01.660]  You guys, now that the show is over,
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:02.380]  I would appreciate it
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:03.820]  if you go to the iTunes store,
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:05.980]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:06.860]  find the review section,
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:08.140]  give me a five star rating
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:09.500]  and after that type in a comment
[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.260]  and let me know what you think of the show
[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:13.100]  and I will read your comments
[01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:14.540]  on a future episode.
[01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:15.900]  I know I haven't done that in a while.
[01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:17.020]  I'm trying to save up a couple
[01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:18.540]  and once we've got enough there,
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:19.660]  I'll go and read three or four,
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:21.100]  four or five comments
[01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:22.860]  and we'll share that with you.
[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:24.220]  I'd appreciate if you go and do that.
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:25.820]  What that does is that
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:27.340]  exposes the show to more people.
[01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:28.940]  It'll move us up in the rankings.
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:30.460]  More people will see the podcast.
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:31.740]  More people will listen.
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:33.900]  More people will grow better cannabis
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:35.180]  and that's the main goal here
[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:36.140]  is just get more people
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:37.660]  to grow better cannabis.
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:39.580]  Yeah, you guys, don't forget
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:40.780]  that the show is available on iTunes,
[01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:42.060]  Stitcher and every single episode
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:43.340]  is always and forever archived
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:45.420]  on iReedGeneticsColorado.com.
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:47.500]  Don't forget about the donation button
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:48.940]  on the website, you guys, on the top right.
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:50.620]  If you go to iReedGeneticsColorado.com,
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:52.220]  click on the Grow From Your Heart podcast tab.
[01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:53.820]  At the top right, there is a donation button
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:55.820]  that goes directly to my PayPal account.
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:56.540]  I've said it before,
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:58.220]  I'm never going to charge you for this podcast.
[01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:00.220]  This podcast is always going to be free,
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:01.740]  but if you'd like to make a contribution,
[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:03.420]  I would truly appreciate it.
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:05.660]  If you're curious where your contribution goes,
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:08.060]  it goes to paying for the hosting of my website.
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:09.820]  It goes for things like new microphone covers.
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:11.660]  I try to have microphone covers for the guests
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:12.780]  because they do this kind of stuff.
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:14.700]  They hear that, they rub their faces
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:15.980]  all over the microphones when they're talking
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:16.780]  because they're new.
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:18.300]  So I try to have a cover for each guest
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:20.060]  so they don't have to go rubbing their face
[01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:21.900]  on another person's mic cover.
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:22.940]  I just think that that's gross.
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:25.660]  Water bottles for all of the guests.
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:29.580]  But mostly it goes to covering the Bluehost website,
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:31.580]  which is where I host, or the Bluehost hosting fee,
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:32.700]  which is where I have my website,
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:34.620]  which is where I host this show.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:36.620]  There's 113 episodes up there,
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:38.460]  so it does take a little bit of bandwidth.
[01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:39.820]  Anyway, I'm just letting you know where that goes.
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:40.540]  I'm not begging.
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:41.500]  If you'd like to contribute,
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.500]  I would definitely, definitely appreciate it.
[01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.180]  I'd give you a big shout out on the show,
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:46.620]  send you a couple of stickers.
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:47.980]  Let's see, what else do I have for you?
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:48.940]  Make sure you listen next week.
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:50.540]  You guys will have Foxtracks on.
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:51.500]  I think that's all I've got.
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:53.420]  Please follow me on Instagram,
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.580]  irie underscore genetics on Instagram.
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:57.660]  I want to give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:58.460]  Thanks again for listening.
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:00.700]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:01.900]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:25.020]  I'm sorry.
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:27.020]  Who's calling me from my unknown number?
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:29.020]  We know.
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:31.020]  I'm sorry.
[01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:33.020]  I pick it up if it's a private call.
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:35.020]  Youngster.
[01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:37.020]  So could it be?
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:40.810]  I would phone if you know what I'm seeing.
[01:35:40.810 --> 01:35:42.810]  I'm a work for your feet.
[01:35:42.810 --> 01:35:44.810]  Friends, they're not letting me be.
[01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:46.810]  Them top of the world, spy out like the KGB.
[01:35:46.810 --> 01:35:48.810]  Yo, so if you know,
[01:35:48.810 --> 01:35:50.810]  you know my black number, call me.
[01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:52.810]  I'm not going to answer even if I'm in army.
[01:35:52.810 --> 01:35:54.810]  I'm a mom.
[01:35:54.810 --> 01:35:56.810]  Regular.
[01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:58.810]  I'm not picking up.
[01:35:58.810 --> 01:36:00.810]  I'm sorry.
[01:36:00.810 --> 01:36:02.810]  Who's calling me from my unknown number?
[01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:04.810]  We know.
[01:36:04.810 --> 01:36:06.810]  I'm sorry.
[01:36:06.810 --> 01:36:08.810]  I pick it up if it's a private call.
