[00:00.000 --> 00:01.360]  Yo, what up podcast world?
[00:01.360 --> 00:05.520]  It's Rasta Jeff and it's Thursday, so that means it's time for another throwback Thursday
[00:05.520 --> 00:08.440]  episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:08.440 --> 00:11.980]  Before I get into the block of old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[00:11.980 --> 00:16.520]  If I mention any advertising, any promotions, any contests, or any giveaways, those have
[00:16.520 --> 00:17.520]  all expired.
[00:17.520 --> 00:22.360]  There are currently no contests, no promotions, no advertising, or no giveaways.
[00:22.360 --> 00:24.880]  Also, let me update all of the social media.
[00:24.880 --> 00:29.960]  If you want to find me on Twitter, you can find me at GFYH Podcast on Twitter, on Facebook,
[00:29.960 --> 00:32.240]  simply search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:32.240 --> 00:36.760]  If you'd like to send me an email, it's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[00:36.760 --> 00:39.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoy these chunks of old episodes.
[00:39.760 --> 00:44.360]  Here we go with the throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:44.360 --> 01:02.130]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:02.130 --> 01:06.570]  It's time for episode number 90 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:06.570 --> 01:07.570]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:07.570 --> 01:08.570]  That's right.
[01:08.570 --> 01:13.250]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're an old school smoker, or
[01:13.250 --> 01:17.050]  if you're a Pendi Warren dab kid, if you're a cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[01:17.050 --> 01:21.570]  just curious about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:21.570 --> 01:22.570]  I'm your host.
[01:22.570 --> 01:23.570]  They call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:23.570 --> 01:24.570]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:24.570 --> 01:28.450]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for letting
[01:28.450 --> 01:29.810]  me play their music on the show.
[01:29.810 --> 01:33.530]  Big thanks to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:33.530 --> 01:36.490]  I'm going to turn down that music a little bit.
[01:36.490 --> 01:41.370]  You guys, our friend Jesse came over, and we recorded for almost two hours.
[01:41.370 --> 01:43.610]  We had to stop for a second and fix the headphone amplifier.
[01:43.610 --> 01:47.450]  It tried to crap out on us, but we got everything back on track.
[01:47.450 --> 01:49.890]  Let's do a quick ad, and then we will get on to the show.
[01:49.890 --> 01:54.410]  You guys, this podcast is brought to you by my good friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[01:54.410 --> 01:57.490]  Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations to serve Colorado.
[01:57.490 --> 02:03.490]  Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beach Street, or check out the Pueblo location on 618 East
[02:03.490 --> 02:06.330]  4th Street in beautiful Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:06.330 --> 02:09.810]  Check out Hygro for competitive pricing and a great selection of indoor grow supplies.
[02:10.250 --> 02:12.210]  You guys, our good friend Jesse works at Hygro.
[02:12.210 --> 02:13.250]  He's the manager there.
[02:13.250 --> 02:15.250]  His wife is probably who you'll bump into.
[02:15.250 --> 02:19.010]  Either Bernadette or LaDonna is most likely who you're going to see when you go in there.
[02:19.010 --> 02:24.370]  There are a couple other folks that work there, but most of the time, it's Jesse, Bern, or
[02:24.370 --> 02:25.370]  LaDonna.
[02:25.370 --> 02:26.930]  When you go in there, you're shopping with my friends.
[02:26.930 --> 02:28.210]  These are really cool people.
[02:28.210 --> 02:29.930]  They are members of the community.
[02:29.930 --> 02:32.450]  They are not just sales folks with a store.
[02:32.450 --> 02:34.050]  They're there to help you out.
[02:34.050 --> 02:37.010]  Make sure you support our friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[02:37.010 --> 02:39.910]  When you are checking out at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies, make sure you let them know
[02:39.910 --> 02:42.370]  you listen to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:42.370 --> 02:45.610]  They will give you commercial pricing on your entire purchase.
[02:45.610 --> 02:47.010]  That'll save you a few bucks.
[02:47.010 --> 02:48.810]  We all know that money is expensive.
[02:48.810 --> 02:50.210]  All right, you guys.
[02:50.210 --> 02:51.610]  I've been rambling long enough.
[02:51.610 --> 02:55.370]  I'm going to let this music fade out, and we will be right back with our good friend
[02:55.370 --> 02:56.370]  Jesse.
[02:56.370 --> 02:59.370]  All right, guys.
[02:59.370 --> 03:02.290]  I am back, and sitting across the table from me is our good buddy Jesse.
[03:02.290 --> 03:03.290]  How are you doing today, bro?
[03:03.290 --> 03:04.290]  Pretty good.
[03:04.290 --> 03:05.290]  Pretty good.
[03:05.290 --> 03:06.290]  Thanks for coming.
[03:06.570 --> 03:07.570]  It's growing season.
[03:07.570 --> 03:08.570]  It is farmer season.
[03:08.570 --> 03:12.410]  You guys, I just threw on the microphones real quick.
[03:12.410 --> 03:15.130]  We were going to do a podcast, and then Jesse mentioned something, and I was like, I'm going
[03:15.130 --> 03:16.690]  to hit record.
[03:16.690 --> 03:21.650]  Jesse just said, if you were using general organics to not adjust the pH when you're
[03:21.650 --> 03:24.730]  done, I completely agree with that.
[03:24.730 --> 03:27.890]  Then what did you say to use to adjust the pH if you had to?
[03:27.890 --> 03:30.170]  Oh, nothing.
[03:30.170 --> 03:36.210]  I was saying it's built into the formula, the CA Mag Plus or Cal Mag Plus that it is.
[03:37.130 --> 03:39.330]  It's a pH buffer.
[03:39.330 --> 03:44.810]  I'm not exactly sure on the entire science of it, but I do know for a fact that if you
[03:44.810 --> 03:47.450]  try to pH it, it will mess your shit up.
[03:47.450 --> 03:49.090]  You're going to have some funky looking plants.
[03:49.090 --> 03:50.090]  Right.
[03:50.090 --> 03:52.650]  Well, because if you're using organics, it's organic.
[03:52.650 --> 03:56.010]  If you go and pour acids in there that we're using, I think it's a phosphoric acid, which
[03:56.010 --> 03:57.010]  is the pH down.
[03:57.010 --> 03:58.010]  I don't remember exactly what it is.
[03:58.010 --> 03:59.010]  Yes, I believe so.
[03:59.010 --> 04:00.010]  There's a couple different-
[04:00.010 --> 04:01.630]  It's got the word acid in there.
[04:01.630 --> 04:04.610]  That tells you that it's going to go in there and start destroying all of your organics
[04:04.610 --> 04:05.610]  and your myco life.
[04:06.010 --> 04:07.010]  All right.
[04:07.010 --> 04:08.970]  Well, I just wanted to get that on recording, guys, since we were talking about it.
[04:08.970 --> 04:11.530]  Sometimes the best shit comes out before I turn on the microphones and I always feel
[04:11.530 --> 04:13.530]  like, damn, I wasted some time there.
[04:13.530 --> 04:15.250]  So I just wanted to put on the mics and get that on there.
[04:15.250 --> 04:16.570]  Jesse, welcome to the show, my friend.
[04:16.570 --> 04:17.570]  Thanks for coming.
[04:17.570 --> 04:18.570]  I really appreciate you having here, bro.
[04:18.570 --> 04:19.570]  Yeah, thanks for having me.
[04:19.570 --> 04:22.050]  All right, I'm all choked up from some dabs.
[04:22.050 --> 04:23.050]  Let's get official.
[04:23.050 --> 04:29.570]  I invited Jesse over to do a podcast and my topic was our friend John Rossum on Periscope
[04:29.570 --> 04:33.570]  asked if he can grow his bag seeds.
[04:33.570 --> 04:36.930]  The short answer is hell yes, you can grow your bag seeds.
[04:36.930 --> 04:39.570]  We've got a really long answer also.
[04:39.570 --> 04:43.530]  One thing I want to mention though, a lot of the older cats that I try to pitch my seeds
[04:43.530 --> 04:48.930]  to are flabbergasted and blown away by the price of a 10 pack of seeds.
[04:48.930 --> 04:53.010]  Lately a 10 pack of seeds will go, it depends on the breeder, anywhere from 50 to 100 bucks
[04:53.010 --> 04:55.210]  for a 10 pack of good regular or feminized-
[04:55.210 --> 04:56.210]  150 even.
[04:56.210 --> 04:57.210]  Yeah, I've seen that all the time.
[04:57.210 --> 05:00.210]  I've seen swan boys are doing 180 now for a 10 pack of seeds.
[05:00.210 --> 05:01.210]  Rare dankness.
[05:01.210 --> 05:02.210]  Okay.
[05:02.250 --> 05:06.050]  Some of these higher known companies are definitely able to get more money, 150 to 200 bucks for
[05:06.050 --> 05:07.050]  a pack of seeds.
[05:07.050 --> 05:09.410]  Now a lot of people are going to say, what the hell?
[05:09.410 --> 05:13.050]  Then some of these old guys, they say, but dude, I've got a big baggie of seeds in my
[05:13.050 --> 05:19.730]  closet from when I used to smoke pot and sift it out on a record cover, on an album cover.
[05:19.730 --> 05:20.730]  Those seeds are great.
[05:20.730 --> 05:23.650]  I recommend you grow those, but do not try to sell those.
[05:23.650 --> 05:28.130]  The reason they aren't sellable, the reason that the seeds us breeders are selling and
[05:28.130 --> 05:32.610]  pushing and promoting, the reason they cost more money is because we know what the parents
[05:32.610 --> 05:33.610]  are.
[05:33.610 --> 05:34.610]  We know what's going to come from those seeds.
[05:34.610 --> 05:40.050]  We've done time selecting the male and female to produce a seed line that has probably gone
[05:40.050 --> 05:43.890]  several years in testing and development to figure out what we want.
[05:43.890 --> 05:45.370]  No herms, high quality.
[05:45.370 --> 05:49.730]  Yeah, and consistency is something I really ... No herms, a lot of quality, good resin
[05:49.730 --> 05:51.770]  production, good flowering time.
[05:51.770 --> 05:55.890]  There are some plants when you get them, I've worked strains down from 90 day flowering
[05:55.890 --> 05:57.770]  times by breeding it into other things.
[05:57.810 --> 06:00.930]  We've cut it down by breeding several times.
[06:00.930 --> 06:04.210]  We've brought it to 60 days and it's still pretty much the same plant.
[06:04.210 --> 06:09.890]  All we've done is breed it to shorter flowering plants, put it to the flow, grow the seeds
[06:09.890 --> 06:14.770]  that come from that out, find the one that's a lot like the original male or female, whichever
[06:14.770 --> 06:19.050]  we're trying to do, and then put that back to flow because flow is a quick plant.
[06:19.050 --> 06:21.850]  So we just bred things to flow and sped it up a little bit.
[06:21.850 --> 06:24.050]  It passes on traits really well too.
[06:24.050 --> 06:25.050]  Yes, she does.
[06:25.330 --> 06:28.330]  If you guys are looking to start a breeding project, get a Colorado flow and play with
[06:28.330 --> 06:30.450]  her because that's a fun one to breed with.
[06:30.450 --> 06:33.690]  But what I'm getting at is those bag seeds that these older cats or maybe you younger
[06:33.690 --> 06:39.170]  cats have, the reason those aren't marketable and sellable is because you don't know the
[06:39.170 --> 06:43.570]  parents, you don't know the genetic heritage of them, so they are not a marketable seed.
[06:43.570 --> 06:45.250]  But you can definitely give them away.
[06:45.250 --> 06:47.850]  You can definitely grow the shit out of them.
[06:47.850 --> 06:49.850]  Grow your bag seed.
[06:49.850 --> 06:51.890]  You could have hermaphrodites, you guys.
[06:51.890 --> 06:53.650]  You could have a bunch of males.
[06:53.650 --> 06:59.130]  You could have shitty ass ragweed, but you could, you very well could have...
[06:59.130 --> 07:00.130]  Something, sorry.
[07:00.130 --> 07:01.130]  No, go for it.
[07:01.130 --> 07:02.130]  Yeah, I see.
[07:02.130 --> 07:03.130]  Something good.
[07:03.130 --> 07:04.130]  Jesse's getting excited over here.
[07:04.130 --> 07:05.130]  I can see that.
[07:05.130 --> 07:06.130]  Kim Dog, well, I'm stoned.
[07:06.130 --> 07:07.130]  I can barely fucking, yeah.
[07:07.130 --> 07:09.130]  You just blurted out exactly the strain.
[07:09.130 --> 07:10.130]  Kim Dog came from...
[07:10.130 --> 07:11.810]  Kim Dog was fucking bag seed.
[07:11.810 --> 07:14.490]  Kim Dog is known as one of the strongest strains on earth.
[07:14.490 --> 07:18.290]  It's been on the cover of High Times Magazine three or four times as the single strongest
[07:18.290 --> 07:19.650]  strain on earth.
[07:19.650 --> 07:23.730]  But also that was old bag seed when strains weren't...
[07:23.730 --> 07:25.130]  This is a really deep discussion.
[07:25.130 --> 07:26.130]  Yes.
[07:26.130 --> 07:27.130]  Yeah.
[07:27.130 --> 07:28.130]  We can get way into the Kim Dog story.
[07:28.130 --> 07:30.050]  There wasn't just a bunch of junk strains back then.
[07:30.050 --> 07:33.690]  I mean, I'm sure there was, but it's...
[07:33.690 --> 07:35.050]  Chances are if somebody grew...
[07:35.050 --> 07:38.930]  If you bought that bag of weed and it had a seed in there, chances are it was decent
[07:38.930 --> 07:39.930]  weed.
[07:39.930 --> 07:40.930]  Yeah.
[07:40.930 --> 07:41.930]  You know what I'm saying?
[07:41.930 --> 07:42.930]  And the only thing is we don't know what it was.
[07:42.930 --> 07:43.930]  It was...
[07:43.930 --> 07:45.370]  A lot of people back in the day don't even know what the girl plant they got or what
[07:45.370 --> 07:46.730]  the buds they got were.
[07:46.730 --> 07:50.090]  They want to say this is like Acapulco gold or something, but it was just whatever that
[07:50.090 --> 07:51.090]  dude said it was.
[07:51.090 --> 07:53.610]  It was before we really knew and cared a lot about genetics.
[07:53.610 --> 07:54.610]  Yeah.
[07:54.610 --> 07:55.610]  Yeah.
[07:55.610 --> 08:00.570]  And then also on things you could get, you could even get Mexican auto flowering.
[08:00.570 --> 08:01.570]  You never know.
[08:01.570 --> 08:02.570]  Yeah.
[08:02.570 --> 08:03.570]  It could.
[08:03.570 --> 08:05.450]  And some people want those Mexican auto flowering plants.
[08:05.450 --> 08:06.810]  Some people would love to have that.
[08:06.810 --> 08:07.810]  Some people...
[08:07.810 --> 08:11.410]  People message me all the time asking when I'm going to make auto flowers.
[08:11.410 --> 08:12.410]  This wasn't...
[08:12.410 --> 08:13.410]  That's my answer.
[08:13.410 --> 08:16.170]  This was never supposed to be about my brand or my company, but I read genetics will never
[08:16.170 --> 08:17.530]  make auto flowering plants.
[08:17.530 --> 08:20.250]  I don't believe in the use of auto flowering.
[08:20.250 --> 08:26.690]  I'm actually straying far away from feminized seeds because I like the males in the population.
[08:26.690 --> 08:30.490]  I think that we need male plants and feminized seeds.
[08:30.490 --> 08:31.490]  They don't...
[08:31.490 --> 08:33.930]  I can't make enough feminized seeds to keep people happy.
[08:33.930 --> 08:34.930]  Yeah.
[08:34.930 --> 08:35.930]  It's hard to do.
[08:35.930 --> 08:36.930]  Yeah.
[08:36.930 --> 08:37.930]  They want so many of them damn things.
[08:37.930 --> 08:41.090]  So Jesse hit the nail right on the head when he said you could have the next chem dog.
[08:41.090 --> 08:43.530]  Chem dog came from bag seed.
[08:43.530 --> 08:49.850]  Two dudes sold a guy a bag of weed on a Grateful Dead parking lot in 95, I think it was.
[08:49.850 --> 08:53.690]  Chem dog found seeds in that weed and he grew that shit.
[08:53.690 --> 08:54.890]  And out of one of those seeds...
[08:54.890 --> 08:58.450]  And you guys go Google the legend of chem dog and the 13 beans.
[08:58.450 --> 09:02.410]  If you're listening to this podcast and you want to be deep into the cannabis culture
[09:02.410 --> 09:07.430]  and you want to know some heritage, Google chem dog and the legend of the 13 beans.
[09:07.430 --> 09:10.810]  And also I got to give a big shout out to the Adam Dunn Show, a podcast.
[09:10.810 --> 09:16.650]  They do an entire episode where chem dog actually calls in and they discuss where this
[09:16.650 --> 09:17.650]  stream came from.
[09:17.650 --> 09:21.770]  A lot of the people that were in the chain of that and everything and...
[09:21.770 --> 09:22.770]  They all call in and...
[09:22.770 --> 09:24.330]  These people were on the old school forums.
[09:24.330 --> 09:28.850]  If any of the listeners are forum junkies, they already know the story, but...
[09:28.850 --> 09:30.170]  I'm going to write this down.
[09:30.170 --> 09:35.090]  One day we're going to have to talk about OG and if OG means overgrow or not.
[09:35.090 --> 09:37.290]  I want to get a few older growers on here and see...
[09:37.290 --> 09:39.530]  When I just said OG, I meant overgrow.
[09:39.530 --> 09:40.530]  Yeah.
[09:40.530 --> 09:42.930]  You meant overgrow the website, overgrow.com.
[09:42.930 --> 09:46.050]  It was a website that we used to frequent and talk about growing cannabis.
[09:46.050 --> 09:47.050]  Subcool was on there.
[09:47.050 --> 09:48.650]  All the cool breeders were on there.
[09:48.650 --> 09:49.650]  Everyone.
[09:49.650 --> 09:55.650]  There's a theory that the OG Kush came from overgrow, but also people think it's the original
[09:55.650 --> 09:56.650]  gangster.
[09:56.650 --> 09:58.450]  I've also heard it ocean grown.
[09:58.450 --> 10:00.090]  We'll talk about that on the show in the future.
[10:00.090 --> 10:03.530]  We need a few more OGs on the show to come talk with us on that one.
[10:03.530 --> 10:04.530]  For sure.
[10:04.530 --> 10:05.530]  All right.
[10:05.530 --> 10:07.730]  So grow out those bag seeds because you could have chem dog, you guys.
[10:07.730 --> 10:08.970]  You could also have junk.
[10:08.970 --> 10:10.810]  You could totally have junk.
[10:10.810 --> 10:14.290]  Here's a little pet peeve.
[10:14.290 --> 10:15.290]  Don't sell clones of junk.
[10:15.290 --> 10:18.290]  If you live in Colorado, don't do that.
[10:18.290 --> 10:19.290]  Grow it out.
[10:19.290 --> 10:23.630]  And don't sell your junky seeds from your junky clones.
[10:23.630 --> 10:24.630]  It's really rude.
[10:24.630 --> 10:25.750]  It is rude.
[10:25.750 --> 10:27.310]  It's disrespectful to your customers.
[10:27.310 --> 10:28.790]  It's disrespectful to your patients.
[10:28.790 --> 10:31.650]  It's disrespectful to the plant itself.
[10:31.650 --> 10:34.730]  It's disrespectful to the future of cannabis.
[10:34.730 --> 10:38.810]  If you grow a plant and you take clones of it, don't give those clones out until you
[10:38.810 --> 10:43.330]  have flowered the damn plant and you've verified that it's something worthwhile.
[10:43.330 --> 10:45.490]  There are so many strains available.
[10:45.490 --> 10:46.490]  Grow something worthwhile.
[10:46.490 --> 10:52.170]  If it's not, as a breeder, it is so hard to breed something and then grow 100 seeds and
[10:52.170 --> 10:55.850]  realize that you have just created fucking hemp.
[10:55.850 --> 10:57.730]  The strain doesn't do us any good.
[10:57.730 --> 11:02.490]  I've got 6,000 seeds of it and all I'm going to do is feed them to some birds because I
[11:02.490 --> 11:03.730]  don't want anybody growing this.
[11:03.730 --> 11:06.610]  I've got one cross that it was a Lemon Kush idea.
[11:06.610 --> 11:10.530]  Dude, it grew the fattest, chunkiest, tallest nuggets.
[11:10.530 --> 11:12.050]  They were bigger than my arms.
[11:12.050 --> 11:14.810]  They didn't have any flavor or any resin.
[11:14.810 --> 11:17.250]  It just grew the biggest hemp ever.
[11:17.250 --> 11:18.250]  It was terrible.
[11:18.250 --> 11:22.450]  Mine, I have horrible herming problems and all mine drives me nuts.
[11:22.450 --> 11:23.810]  On your breeding projects?
[11:23.810 --> 11:24.810]  Yeah.
[11:24.810 --> 11:25.810]  Oh, man.
[11:25.810 --> 11:27.610]  Because so much of it's involved with chem dog.
[11:27.610 --> 11:30.930]  Yeah, chem does have a tendency to herm in there.
[11:30.930 --> 11:34.450]  You guys got to find, if you're going to breed with chem dog, make sure you back cross
[11:34.450 --> 11:36.730]  or out cross that hermitry.
[11:36.730 --> 11:40.850]  Go find a solid progeny, two solid progeny from your F1s and work those.
[11:40.850 --> 11:42.490]  I'm just going ahead of myself here.
[11:42.490 --> 11:43.490]  All right.
[11:43.490 --> 11:48.130]  Sometimes it's hard to guess what pollinated the seeded buds that you've got, but you know
[11:48.130 --> 11:51.410]  that that female makes quality medicine.
[11:51.410 --> 11:55.610]  Maybe the donor was a male in the room, maybe something hermed, but it's probably just a
[11:55.610 --> 11:56.610]  stress seed.
[11:56.610 --> 11:59.530]  It's usually a light leak or something like that is what's causing these bag seeds.
[11:59.530 --> 12:00.530]  Overnuting.
[12:01.130 --> 12:02.130]  Irregular watering.
[12:02.130 --> 12:03.130]  Yeah, surprises.
[12:03.130 --> 12:04.130]  Surprises on the plants.
[12:04.130 --> 12:05.130]  Definitely.
[12:05.130 --> 12:09.090]  If you get them too hot, let them get too dry, they'll start throwing out seeds.
[12:09.090 --> 12:13.930]  A seed is the plant's response of, oh shit.
[12:13.930 --> 12:14.930]  The plant goes, you know what?
[12:14.930 --> 12:16.730]  I think I'm going to die here soon.
[12:16.730 --> 12:19.770]  It's like a horny person.
[12:19.770 --> 12:21.130]  It just wants to reproduce.
[12:21.130 --> 12:23.330]  That's the plant's whole mission.
[12:23.330 --> 12:24.330]  Just to reproduce.
[12:24.330 --> 12:27.250]  The resin is there to protect the plant so that it can reproduce.
[12:27.250 --> 12:31.450]  The pistils, which everybody calls hairs, those are there to collect pollen so that
[12:31.450 --> 12:32.770]  it can reproduce.
[12:32.770 --> 12:35.450]  Everything is all about these plants reproducing.
[12:35.450 --> 12:40.050]  If you piss off a plant, it will try to make a seed as a reaction.
[12:40.050 --> 12:42.250]  It just wants to make sure that it continues.
[12:42.250 --> 12:43.250]  It doesn't want to be wiped out.
[12:43.250 --> 12:45.090]  It's main job in life.
[12:45.090 --> 12:46.690]  That is its job.
[12:46.690 --> 12:48.730]  That's its purpose is to reproduce and continue.
[12:48.730 --> 12:51.290]  We're tricking it in many ways.
[12:51.290 --> 12:53.370]  Be respectful to it.
[12:53.490 --> 12:57.810]  I think I had a list of which strains were, here they are.
[12:57.810 --> 13:00.010]  Gorilla glue number four and seven.
[13:00.010 --> 13:03.890]  All of the gorilla glue strains were actually bag seed.
[13:03.890 --> 13:07.610]  Accidental pollinations that created seeds that Josie Wales, shout out to Josie Wales,
[13:07.610 --> 13:10.010]  a grower slash breeder.
[13:10.010 --> 13:12.610]  Or good accident, happy accident.
[13:12.610 --> 13:13.610]  We're glad that happened.
[13:13.610 --> 13:16.610]  Thanks for popping those beans.
[13:16.610 --> 13:20.130]  Golden goat, one of Colorado's most popular strains ever.
[13:20.130 --> 13:23.250]  One of my most popular strains for my growing, my photography.
[13:23.250 --> 13:25.970]  A lot of people give me credit for breeding golden goat.
[13:25.970 --> 13:29.370]  I'm going to say right now, I did not breed the golden goat.
[13:29.370 --> 13:33.570]  Golden goat was bred by a guy known as Mr. Dank in Topeka, Kansas.
[13:33.570 --> 13:37.850]  It was an accident that was not meant to happen.
[13:37.850 --> 13:38.850]  Jesse's headphones are cutting out here.
[13:38.850 --> 13:39.850]  I'll give him a pause for a second.
[13:39.850 --> 13:40.850]  Cool, I got you.
[13:40.850 --> 13:41.850]  All right, guys.
[13:41.850 --> 13:42.850]  I think we're back.
[13:42.850 --> 13:46.170]  I think we recorded all the first part too.
[13:46.170 --> 13:47.170]  I'm pretty sure.
[13:47.170 --> 13:49.410]  We're using the Zoom H6 handy recorder today.
[13:49.690 --> 13:51.490]  I'm pretty sure I recorded that first part.
[13:51.490 --> 13:54.170]  We had to take a quick break.
[13:54.170 --> 14:00.450]  This Live Wire Solutions HA04 four-channel stereo headphone amplifier, it's going to get
[14:00.450 --> 14:04.650]  a hammer put to it pretty soon here because it just pisses me off.
[14:04.650 --> 14:06.170]  I think we were on golden goat.
[14:06.170 --> 14:07.170]  Golden goat.
[14:07.170 --> 14:09.330]  I was saying that I did not breed the golden goat, right?
[14:09.330 --> 14:10.330]  That was put into-
[14:10.330 --> 14:11.330]  Yeah, Mr. Dank.
[14:11.330 --> 14:12.330]  Mr. Dank bred that.
[14:12.330 --> 14:13.330]  Topeka, Kansas of all places.
[14:13.330 --> 14:16.090]  I did, however, get a clone of it.
[14:16.090 --> 14:19.170]  When I first started breeding, I thought I had Topeka, Kansas of all damn places.
[14:19.930 --> 14:20.930]  I almost skipped right over that.
[14:20.930 --> 14:23.970]  That's probably the coolest town in Kansas.
[14:23.970 --> 14:24.970]  I'm going to vote for Lawrence.
[14:24.970 --> 14:25.970]  I'm going to vote for Lawrence, Kansas.
[14:25.970 --> 14:30.770]  I have done things in Lawrence, Kansas that I can't even talk about on this podcast.
[14:30.770 --> 14:33.530]  My boss got T-boned in that.
[14:33.530 --> 14:36.450]  There's an army base outside of there.
[14:36.450 --> 14:42.250]  He got T-boned there, so we ended up spending a day and a half in Lawrence, Kansas.
[14:42.250 --> 14:44.210]  It's not the Kansas I'm used to.
[14:44.210 --> 14:45.210]  That's the truth.
[14:45.210 --> 14:46.890]  There's a club every 30 seconds.
[14:46.890 --> 14:47.890]  It's like the boulder.
[14:48.610 --> 14:51.010]  It's the liberal stronghold of that state.
[14:51.010 --> 14:52.010]  It definitely is.
[14:52.010 --> 14:53.010]  KU.
[14:53.010 --> 14:54.570]  Topeka's pretty close to that.
[14:54.570 --> 14:55.570]  We went to Topeka.
[14:55.570 --> 14:56.570]  We went to Wichita.
[14:56.570 --> 14:57.570]  We went all over the place.
[14:57.570 --> 15:01.010]  I lived in Lawrence for a little while, so I had a good time there.
[15:01.010 --> 15:03.930]  The golden goat, I got a hold of a clone of it.
[15:03.930 --> 15:08.010]  My good friend Josh, a long time ago, gave me a clone of that.
[15:08.010 --> 15:09.010]  The Hawaiian guy.
[15:09.010 --> 15:10.010]  I call him the Hawaiian guy.
[15:10.010 --> 15:12.650]  I called him Pineapple Express, is what I used to call him.
[15:12.650 --> 15:15.450]  I haven't hung out with that dude in a long-ass time.
[15:15.450 --> 15:17.810]  Pineapple Express brought me a clone of the golden goat.
[15:18.730 --> 15:22.850]  When I first started breeding, one of my ideas was I felt bad that in Colorado we had all
[15:22.850 --> 15:25.370]  of the elite genetics and everybody in Idaho.
[15:25.370 --> 15:26.370]  I never felt that.
[15:26.370 --> 15:27.370]  I know.
[15:27.370 --> 15:28.370]  I know.
[15:28.370 --> 15:29.370]  I'm a compassionate guy.
[15:29.370 --> 15:31.650]  They were like, how do I get these clones?
[15:31.650 --> 15:32.650]  I want clones.
[15:32.650 --> 15:36.430]  I was like, I can't get you clones of these elite cuts, but I will make seeds of them.
[15:36.430 --> 15:39.970]  My idea was to make seeds of the golden goat just by reversing it.
[15:39.970 --> 15:41.690]  I did put seeds of the golden goat out.
[15:41.690 --> 15:45.530]  I'm the one that made the S1 feminized golden goat seeds.
[15:45.530 --> 15:47.770]  As far as I know, I'm the only one that has done that.
[15:47.770 --> 15:49.970]  I put about 5,000 of those seeds out.
[15:49.970 --> 15:52.930]  You're one of the only people that have bred with it.
[15:52.930 --> 15:56.090]  You and I think Scott's done something with it.
[15:56.090 --> 15:59.130]  I've seen Gage make one strain with golden goat.
[15:59.130 --> 16:00.130]  Yeah.
[16:00.130 --> 16:01.130]  Yeah.
[16:01.130 --> 16:06.010]  And then Ali, fuck, what's his seed company name?
[16:06.010 --> 16:10.490]  Ali G, no, fuck.
[16:10.490 --> 16:11.970]  There's a dude out of San Francisco.
[16:11.970 --> 16:14.970]  Yeah, Ali G or Al-G, that's what it is.
[16:14.970 --> 16:15.970]  Okay.
[16:15.970 --> 16:16.970]  I'm going to have to Google this guy.
[16:17.170 --> 16:21.410]  I'm not going to say it phonetically, but he's bred a couple of strains with golden
[16:21.410 --> 16:22.410]  goat.
[16:22.410 --> 16:23.410]  Cool.
[16:23.410 --> 16:27.090]  It's a great plant, but it was, like we're talking about, it was from a bag seed.
[16:27.090 --> 16:28.330]  It was an accident.
[16:28.330 --> 16:36.250]  Colorado takes pretty much all the credit for that, but that is definitely a local strain.
[16:36.250 --> 16:38.210]  That's partly my fault.
[16:38.210 --> 16:42.930]  It's a pain in the ass to keep a mother.
[16:42.930 --> 16:44.930]  You have to take clones from that golden goat often.
[16:44.930 --> 16:46.490]  If you've got one, hold on to it.
[16:46.490 --> 16:51.690]  I guarantee you in a few more years, that'll be, it's a lot of strains are getting harder
[16:51.690 --> 16:52.690]  to find.
[16:52.690 --> 16:53.690]  That's true.
[16:53.690 --> 16:54.690]  Like the good original, you know.
[16:54.690 --> 16:55.690]  The old school blueberry.
[16:55.690 --> 16:56.690]  Yeah.
[16:56.690 --> 16:57.970]  Show me a good chem four.
[16:57.970 --> 16:59.970]  Give me a P91 clone.
[16:59.970 --> 17:00.970]  Yeah.
[17:00.970 --> 17:01.970]  Romulan.
[17:01.970 --> 17:04.970]  That's, fuck, everyone used to grow Romulan.
[17:04.970 --> 17:05.970]  I've heard a couple of people.
[17:05.970 --> 17:06.970]  I think it might've been.
[17:06.970 --> 17:07.970]  All right, I'm going to give you a shout out right quick.
[17:07.970 --> 17:12.610]  Jesse is actually the moderator and he's the one that started the, what's the name of the
[17:12.610 --> 17:13.610]  Facebook group?
[17:13.810 --> 17:15.810]  Colorado Cannabis Growers.
[17:15.810 --> 17:16.810]  Yeah.
[17:16.810 --> 17:18.690]  So you guys join Jesse's Facebook group.
[17:18.690 --> 17:21.090]  If you're serious, I will troll you a little bit.
[17:21.090 --> 17:23.610]  I hope you have a little bit of thick skin.
[17:23.610 --> 17:27.850]  I hope you're not an internet vagina because I'm a troll and I'm going to get you, but
[17:27.850 --> 17:28.850]  it's a fun group.
[17:28.850 --> 17:29.850]  Come join us.
[17:29.850 --> 17:33.850]  We, they help you learn about cannabis in a fun, positive way.
[17:33.850 --> 17:35.930]  We will clear up all the rumors and myths.
[17:35.930 --> 17:37.850]  If you have a question, come join the group.
[17:37.850 --> 17:41.590]  If you're a cannabis grower, if you're curious about cannabis, we love teaching you.
[17:41.590 --> 17:45.110]  We love sharing and it's another Avenue to do that and it's free.
[17:45.110 --> 17:52.270]  If you're a total noob, um, you know, not to be a dick, but that's, there are better
[17:52.270 --> 17:58.110]  groups to find this, you know, this group is comprised of growers only.
[17:58.110 --> 18:00.110]  So you know, it's, yeah.
[18:00.110 --> 18:01.110]  Don't be shy you guys.
[18:01.110 --> 18:02.110]  If you have a question.
[18:02.110 --> 18:03.110]  Yeah.
[18:03.110 --> 18:06.270]  I mean, or hit me up on Facebook or Jesse directly and we will answer your questions.
[18:06.270 --> 18:07.310]  Jesse may take a little bit longer.
[18:07.310 --> 18:09.070]  He doesn't carry the iPhone like I do.
[18:09.070 --> 18:12.350]  He's not attached to it like I am, but I've usually got the phone in my pocket when I'm
[18:12.350 --> 18:13.350]  working at the spot.
[18:13.350 --> 18:17.670]  I've got the phone turned off because there's no service back there anyway.
[18:17.670 --> 18:18.670]  Yeah.
[18:18.670 --> 18:19.670]  Yeah.
[18:19.670 --> 18:20.670]  If services grow funny and grow rooms.
[18:20.670 --> 18:21.670]  Yeah.
[18:21.670 --> 18:23.950]  Dude, our facility is like a fucking bomb shelter.
[18:23.950 --> 18:25.350]  I can live back there for six months.
[18:25.350 --> 18:28.670]  Try to turn a radio on in the middle of it when all the lights are on.
[18:28.670 --> 18:32.270]  Although you got to compete as I don't know if that's still, you know, we're way off topic
[18:32.270 --> 18:36.190]  here, but in Denver, you guys, this is something that I recently heard and or read about and
[18:36.190 --> 18:39.510]  had a conversation with multiple people about in Denver.
[18:39.510 --> 18:40.510]  They're driving around.
[18:40.510 --> 18:41.510]  Okay.
[18:41.510 --> 18:45.470]  If you're running old school magnetic ballast, I'm not sure if the new digitals will do it,
[18:45.470 --> 18:50.790]  but the old school magnetics, if you're running enough of those, they put off an AM frequency.
[18:50.790 --> 18:54.710]  And if you take an AM radio in that room, you have it tuned into the station.
[18:54.710 --> 18:55.710]  It's working.
[18:55.710 --> 18:56.710]  You can hear it.
[18:56.710 --> 18:59.030]  If you walk near those ballast, it will cut out and make a weird humming noise.
[18:59.030 --> 19:02.830]  It's at a specific, a frequent frequency too.
[19:02.830 --> 19:03.830]  Yeah.
[19:03.830 --> 19:08.070]  I've tried it on a couple of places I know of.
[19:08.070 --> 19:13.390]  It makes a hum and some, some like dashes and beeps.
[19:13.390 --> 19:15.790]  It definitely puts off a unique signal.
[19:15.790 --> 19:21.030]  So yeah, the Denver police are using an ultra sensitive radio pickup.
[19:21.030 --> 19:24.390]  I'm not probably a strong antenna is what I guess they're using.
[19:24.390 --> 19:29.430]  They're driving around neighborhoods and when they get that, they're driving back by with
[19:29.430 --> 19:32.550]  infrared cameras and now they're checking your lights.
[19:32.550 --> 19:33.550]  Yeah.
[19:34.270 --> 19:36.270]  Amsterdam all over.
[19:36.270 --> 19:39.710]  Well, once they've done that, they're going back home or back to the station and checking
[19:39.710 --> 19:43.790]  to see if you're a medical marijuana caregiver so that you've got permission to have all
[19:43.790 --> 19:48.110]  these lights or since in the state of Colorado, we're only supposed to have six plants.
[19:48.110 --> 19:51.230]  If you've got all that light, you're supposed to be registered as a grower.
[19:51.230 --> 19:54.110]  If you're not, they go and knock on your door and ask what's going on.
[19:54.110 --> 19:55.110]  Yeah.
[19:55.110 --> 19:59.870]  So in Denver, be careful if you've got those magnetic ballasts.
[19:59.870 --> 20:02.230]  For the cops or for the guys using magnetic ballasts?
[20:02.910 --> 20:03.910]  Well, yeah.
[20:03.910 --> 20:06.630]  Come buy some nanos from me or our Denver store.
[20:06.630 --> 20:07.630]  There you go.
[20:07.630 --> 20:08.630]  On Beach Street.
[20:08.630 --> 20:09.630]  Yes.
[20:09.630 --> 20:12.630]  Ask for Brandon or Cassandra.
[20:12.630 --> 20:14.950]  Cassandra, that's the chick you'll see.
[20:14.950 --> 20:16.510]  She's cool as fuck.
[20:16.510 --> 20:17.510]  Is that the Denver store?
[20:17.510 --> 20:18.510]  Yeah.
[20:18.510 --> 20:19.510]  All right.
[20:19.510 --> 20:21.030]  I've never been to the Denver store, so I may have to drop in there and just go wander
[20:21.030 --> 20:24.310]  around and not even tell them who I am and just walk around and look at the store.
[20:24.310 --> 20:25.870]  I like to do that when they don't know who I am.
[20:25.870 --> 20:26.870]  All right.
[20:26.870 --> 20:29.590]  So we're getting we're getting high and getting off topic here, but we've had a few dabs,
[20:29.590 --> 20:31.390]  so that's OK.
[20:31.550 --> 20:32.550]  What else was I going to say?
[20:32.550 --> 20:33.710]  I'm going to be controversial here.
[20:33.710 --> 20:39.630]  I cannot prove this, but it is my theory that the Girl Scout cookies is probably a fuck
[20:39.630 --> 20:41.710]  up and it was an accident and it's a bag seed.
[20:41.710 --> 20:43.070]  I don't think they bred that on purpose.
[20:43.070 --> 20:45.950]  I've bred with it.
[20:45.950 --> 20:48.670]  There's a reason I haven't released any of my stuff yet.
[20:48.670 --> 20:54.590]  I have very high standards and I haven't been able to achieve them yet.
[20:54.590 --> 20:57.470]  But Girl Scout cookies, in my opinion, is a herm.
[20:57.470 --> 20:59.990]  It does not breed stable.
[20:59.990 --> 21:01.750]  I've crossed it to the grateful dog.
[21:01.750 --> 21:02.750]  Really neat breeder.
[21:02.750 --> 21:04.950]  It is a really neat plant to breed with.
[21:04.950 --> 21:05.950]  Fuck yeah.
[21:05.950 --> 21:09.790]  But it produces hermaphrodites.
[21:09.790 --> 21:12.870]  I put it to the grateful dog and you would not believe what it put out.
[21:12.870 --> 21:14.270]  I'll show you a little bit after we record here.
[21:14.270 --> 21:15.270]  I've got another.
[21:15.270 --> 21:16.270]  I've seen some pictures.
[21:16.270 --> 21:18.270]  I know a couple of other people that have grown that.
[21:18.270 --> 21:19.270]  Yeah.
[21:19.270 --> 21:20.270]  Yeah.
[21:20.270 --> 21:21.270]  No, that one's that's that's a tasty.
[21:21.270 --> 21:22.270]  Maybe not grateful dog.
[21:22.270 --> 21:26.390]  I'm thinking of the other one of the King Kim to the Girl Scout.
[21:26.390 --> 21:27.390]  Yes.
[21:27.390 --> 21:28.390]  Yes.
[21:28.390 --> 21:29.390]  I'm thinking of that.
[21:29.390 --> 21:34.550]  That was, you know, after breeding with it and growing and seeing a couple of different
[21:34.550 --> 21:38.950]  hybrids of it, you know, you can recognize it real quick for sure.
[21:38.950 --> 21:39.950]  But yeah.
[21:39.950 --> 21:40.950]  All right.
[21:40.950 --> 21:43.710]  So we're talking about herm seeds or not herm seeds, about bag seeds.
[21:43.710 --> 21:45.590]  If you're going to go back, see, they already said that.
[21:45.590 --> 21:46.590]  Right.
[21:46.590 --> 21:50.430]  You got to be careful for hermaphrodites when you're growing these bag seeds.
[21:50.430 --> 21:53.230]  Treat it just like a normal seed during veg.
[21:53.230 --> 21:54.470]  You're not going to know what the parents are.
[21:54.470 --> 21:56.790]  So you're going to have to pay a lot of attention to it during flower.
[21:56.790 --> 22:02.350]  When you start flowering, you have to look every single day for hermaphrodite flowers
[22:02.350 --> 22:03.350]  on these plants.
[22:03.350 --> 22:04.350]  Oh, yeah.
[22:04.350 --> 22:05.350]  Every day.
[22:05.350 --> 22:06.350]  And sometimes twice a day.
[22:06.350 --> 22:07.350]  Yeah.
[22:07.350 --> 22:08.350]  Yeah.
[22:08.350 --> 22:09.790]  And look out for males, too, for the first three weeks.
[22:09.790 --> 22:10.790]  Look out for males.
[22:10.790 --> 22:11.790]  I've had plants surprise me.
[22:11.790 --> 22:14.070]  I thought they were full on female until about day 20.
[22:14.070 --> 22:16.150]  And then it popped open a nut sack somewhere.
[22:16.150 --> 22:18.450]  And I'm like, oh, that's got to go.
[22:18.450 --> 22:24.470]  So look for male flowers, herm flowers all over the entire plant once or twice a day
[22:24.670 --> 22:29.510]  through the entire bloom cycle, you guys, of a bag seed, because it could herm out there.
[22:29.510 --> 22:34.110]  It had a seed for a reason, and it could herm out in the end of week eight.
[22:34.110 --> 22:38.710]  So if it does, you either need to be able to harvest it before it produces a seed or
[22:38.710 --> 22:43.150]  you need to get in there and be able to tweeze out if it makes one or two male flowers.
[22:43.150 --> 22:46.750]  Sometimes you can pull them out with tweezers, hit the plant, spray the plant with a water
[22:46.750 --> 22:50.870]  bottle, just misted a little bit because mist deactivates pollen.
[22:50.870 --> 22:51.870]  Moisture will ruin pollen.
[22:51.870 --> 22:55.070]  So give it a nice mist, get in there with some tweezers and pull out those male flowers,
[22:55.070 --> 22:57.070]  put them in a trash bag, throw them away.
[22:57.070 --> 23:01.270]  I got in an argument with someone in Facebook land the other day.
[23:01.270 --> 23:08.390]  I posted a picture of a friend's hemp plant male, and he told me that that growth spot
[23:08.390 --> 23:14.710]  was ruined for life and that pollen doesn't die and it travels for hundreds of miles and
[23:14.710 --> 23:15.710]  all that.
[23:15.710 --> 23:16.710]  Yeah.
[23:16.710 --> 23:19.710]  Got anything to say about that, Jeff?
[23:20.550 --> 23:24.030]  I just want to go to that forum or that post and just troll that guy is what I want to
[23:24.030 --> 23:25.030]  do.
[23:25.030 --> 23:27.310]  No, actually pollen, you can get rid of pollen quite easily.
[23:27.310 --> 23:30.070]  Sweep the floor, get in there with some water.
[23:30.070 --> 23:31.510]  Water deactivates pollen, you guys.
[23:31.510 --> 23:32.510]  It's all you got to do.
[23:32.510 --> 23:33.510]  It's very, very fragile.
[23:33.510 --> 23:34.510]  Yes.
[23:34.510 --> 23:35.510]  It's hard to store.
[23:35.510 --> 23:36.510]  In fact, it's so hard to store.
[23:36.510 --> 23:37.510]  You have to keep it.
[23:37.510 --> 23:38.510]  I keep my pollen.
[23:38.510 --> 23:43.390]  I have little vials of pollen that are sealed and they are in side of another jar that is
[23:43.390 --> 23:47.510]  sealed and that is inside of a refrigerator that stays dark.
[23:47.510 --> 23:49.790]  That's how careful I am with my pollen.
[23:49.790 --> 23:50.790]  Big shout out to Canaventure.
[23:50.790 --> 23:51.790]  What up, Rusty?
[23:51.790 --> 23:53.190]  Rusty threw a bunch of pollen on me.
[23:53.190 --> 23:57.190]  The last time he was here, he dropped off four or five little bags of pollen.
[23:57.190 --> 24:00.710]  There may be some Canaventure iri crosses coming up in the near future.
[24:00.710 --> 24:06.510]  That's where all my Yeti stuff came from was a friendly pollen delivery from someone.
[24:06.510 --> 24:11.710]  Man, shout out to that Yeti OG that you made live resin with last summer.
[24:11.710 --> 24:12.710]  Nice.
[24:12.710 --> 24:13.710]  Thank you.
[24:13.710 --> 24:16.310]  That stuff was memorable, remarkable, legendary.
[24:16.310 --> 24:17.710]  That was some good shit, dude.
[24:17.710 --> 24:18.710]  I wish that was back around.
[24:18.710 --> 24:19.710]  Big shout out to Spence.
[24:19.710 --> 24:20.710]  He's the one that made that.
[24:20.710 --> 24:21.710]  So was the cookies.
[24:21.710 --> 24:22.710]  Oh, yeah.
[24:22.710 --> 24:23.710]  There was just a little bit of that.
[24:23.710 --> 24:24.710]  I got some of that.
[24:24.710 --> 24:25.710]  Luckily, I get to be in the group.
[24:25.710 --> 24:28.910]  Something else, too, that was in the spring.
[24:28.910 --> 24:31.710]  You had some good runs back then, too.
[24:31.710 --> 24:32.710]  Yeah.
[24:32.710 --> 24:36.070]  Seems like everybody got busy and carried away and all the hash artists got too busy
[24:36.070 --> 24:37.590]  and we're just all disconnected.
[24:37.590 --> 24:39.390]  We need to all reconnect again.
[24:39.390 --> 24:40.390]  Yeah.
[24:40.390 --> 24:41.390]  All right.
[24:41.390 --> 24:42.390]  Everybody on the podcast.
[24:42.390 --> 24:43.390]  We need everybody on the podcast again.
[24:43.390 --> 24:44.390]  Everybody, you got to come back.
[24:44.390 --> 24:45.390]  We're going to get a party going.
[24:45.470 --> 24:46.470]  We haven't all connected in a while.
[24:46.470 --> 24:47.470]  You know what?
[24:47.470 --> 24:48.470]  Episode 100 is coming up, dude.
[24:48.470 --> 24:49.470]  No way.
[24:49.470 --> 24:50.470]  Yeah.
[24:50.470 --> 24:51.470]  This is going to be number 90, I think, right here.
[24:51.470 --> 24:52.470]  No way.
[24:52.470 --> 24:53.470]  Yeah.
[24:53.470 --> 24:54.470]  Damn.
[24:54.470 --> 24:55.470]  Yeah.
[24:55.470 --> 24:56.470]  I didn't do an intro for it, but this, I think this is number 90.
[24:56.470 --> 24:57.470]  Yeah.
[24:57.470 --> 24:58.470]  So number 100 is coming up, you guys.
[24:58.470 --> 25:02.070]  If you have any cool ideas, if you want to be on episode number 100, hit me up.
[25:02.070 --> 25:03.670]  It's hyregenetics at hotmail.com.
[25:03.670 --> 25:04.670]  I'd love to have you on the show.
[25:04.670 --> 25:05.670]  All right.
[25:05.670 --> 25:07.350]  So we're talking about bag seeds.
[25:07.350 --> 25:09.190]  What else do you have to add about bag seed, bro?
[25:09.190 --> 25:10.190]  Where were we?
[25:10.190 --> 25:11.190]  Where are Girl Scout cookies?
[25:11.190 --> 25:16.710]  I was assuming, alleging that Girl Scout cookies was probably an accident and came from bag
[25:16.710 --> 25:17.710]  seed.
[25:17.710 --> 25:21.910]  A part of my theory on that is because I've heard so many different rumors and legends
[25:21.910 --> 25:24.670]  of how it was made and who made it.
[25:24.670 --> 25:28.870]  And I've never, the people that are alleged to have made it have never said what it is
[25:28.870 --> 25:29.870]  and they won't.
[25:29.870 --> 25:31.910]  I hear it's an F1 derby is what I hear a lot.
[25:31.910 --> 25:32.910]  I'll call them out.
[25:32.910 --> 25:35.990]  They've said straight up, they've said two or three different stories.
[25:35.990 --> 25:39.110]  So I wouldn't even believe anything they said at this point.
[25:39.110 --> 25:42.910]  I've read at least three different stories in high times and they all say they came from
[25:42.910 --> 25:43.910]  the same people.
[25:43.910 --> 25:46.710]  And they all say no one has it and that's a bunch of bullshit.
[25:46.710 --> 25:47.710]  It's everywhere.
[25:47.710 --> 25:50.270]  If you don't have Girl Scout cookies yet by now, let us know because everybody in our
[25:50.270 --> 25:55.310]  crew has a, I've got the platinum, I've got the forum, I've got cookies and cream by now,
[25:55.310 --> 25:56.950]  I've got cookie wreck.
[25:56.950 --> 25:57.950]  There's cookies times everything.
[25:57.950 --> 26:00.470]  I know people that are done with it and letting it go.
[26:00.470 --> 26:01.470]  Right.
[26:01.470 --> 26:04.230]  That's like pretty much all that Maddie and Spence want to smoke is cookies.
[26:04.230 --> 26:05.550]  It's still one of my favorite smokes.
[26:05.550 --> 26:06.550]  I've got some in the corner now.
[26:06.550 --> 26:07.550]  So let me know if you want another one back.
[26:07.550 --> 26:08.550]  Oh yeah, no.
[26:08.990 --> 26:11.190]  I spread that around good.
[26:11.190 --> 26:12.190]  Yeah.
[26:12.190 --> 26:15.990]  If you really want something, go to the forums.
[26:15.990 --> 26:16.990]  That's the truth.
[26:16.990 --> 26:20.870]  I've got two sources for, two or three good sources for clones around here.
[26:20.870 --> 26:23.030]  And one of them, he gets everything from the forums.
[26:23.030 --> 26:24.030]  He's kind of a quiet guy.
[26:24.030 --> 26:25.310]  He does not look like a pot grower.
[26:25.310 --> 26:29.390]  He looks like he probably would work on computers or study law somewhere.
[26:29.390 --> 26:32.630]  And so he shows up with a briefcase and opens it up and drops me off a few cuttings of some
[26:32.630 --> 26:34.470]  elite shit that he got online.
[26:34.470 --> 26:36.510]  I love when clones come from him.
[26:36.510 --> 26:40.270]  And also it seems like right around the same time he gets them, either you or Spence will
[26:40.270 --> 26:43.910]  end up with the same cuttings and you guys will throw me a cut or I'll trade you a cut
[26:43.910 --> 26:45.830]  just because that's how our group works.
[26:45.830 --> 26:47.550]  And I'll run them side by side.
[26:47.550 --> 26:50.790]  And I'm always so amazed that everybody got the same cut.
[26:50.790 --> 26:54.590]  Like, how did Spence end up with this Girl Scout cookies and my other friend ended up
[26:54.590 --> 26:58.110]  with the Girl Scout cookies and I ran them and they're the same fucking thing.
[26:58.110 --> 27:00.910]  And they started from the same seed somewhere.
[27:00.910 --> 27:02.550]  It's so amazing to me.
[27:02.550 --> 27:05.770]  And then, I mean, just seeing, I mean, we've all grown enough of it.
[27:05.770 --> 27:08.650]  You can tell instantly if it's it.
[27:08.650 --> 27:12.570]  How do all these people on the internet have the same freaking thing?
[27:12.570 --> 27:13.570]  Yeah.
[27:13.570 --> 27:14.570]  Like, it's crazy.
[27:14.570 --> 27:15.570]  Yeah.
[27:15.570 --> 27:16.570]  They're getting around.
[27:16.570 --> 27:19.570]  People are flying, they're driving, they're taking a horse.
[27:19.570 --> 27:20.570]  I don't know what they're doing.
[27:20.570 --> 27:24.210]  So you guys, if you get some weed, if you get some good quality cannabis and it's got
[27:24.210 --> 27:27.770]  a couple of healthy good looking seeds in there and you don't have money to spend on
[27:27.770 --> 27:33.610]  some high quality seeds that we know all the history behind them and they were bred by
[27:33.610 --> 27:37.050]  magic elves in a dungeon in Quebec.
[27:37.050 --> 27:38.490]  I'm just being a smart ass here.
[27:38.490 --> 27:42.610]  But if you don't want to pay good money for seeds, if you don't have access to good clones,
[27:42.610 --> 27:46.010]  just throw some of those bag seeds in a paper towel, germinate them, start them out just
[27:46.010 --> 27:49.930]  like you would any other seeds and pay a lot of attention and then grow them out, smoke
[27:49.930 --> 27:51.210]  it with your friends.
[27:51.210 --> 27:53.450]  Here's something I really have to say.
[27:53.450 --> 27:54.450]  Take a fucking clone.
[27:54.450 --> 27:57.610]  Oh my God, you guys, you wouldn't believe how many people say, look what I grew from
[27:57.610 --> 27:59.330]  seed and I'm like, can I get a clone of that?
[27:59.330 --> 28:01.010]  And they're like, oh, I didn't take any clones.
[28:01.010 --> 28:02.010]  Yeah.
[28:02.010 --> 28:03.010]  Dude, take a clone.
[28:03.010 --> 28:04.010]  Take a little clone.
[28:04.010 --> 28:05.970]  You dip it some shit and you put it in a router, get some clones.
[28:05.970 --> 28:08.530]  If it herms really bad, don't take a clone.
[28:08.530 --> 28:09.530]  That's true.
[28:09.530 --> 28:10.530]  Yeah.
[28:10.530 --> 28:11.530]  If it herms, throw away those clones.
[28:11.530 --> 28:12.890]  If it grows balls, throw away all the clones.
[28:12.890 --> 28:15.370]  Grow more seeds because bag seeds are free.
[28:15.370 --> 28:18.290]  You already paid 50 bucks for that eighth or whatever you paid for it.
[28:18.290 --> 28:22.490]  Make sure you grow the seeds that are in there and then you could have the next chem dog.
[28:22.490 --> 28:24.250]  You could grow the next girl scout cookies.
[28:24.250 --> 28:26.370]  You could grow the next gorilla glue.
[28:26.370 --> 28:28.450]  You could grow the next golden goat.
[28:28.450 --> 28:29.450]  OG.
[28:29.450 --> 28:32.210]  You could have the next OG kush.
[28:32.410 --> 28:35.410]  You could be the Tahoe.
[28:35.410 --> 28:36.410]  Um, shit.
[28:36.410 --> 28:37.410]  What else?
[28:37.410 --> 28:38.410]  What's another one?
[28:38.410 --> 28:39.410]  Crippy, crippy.
[28:39.410 --> 28:40.410]  East coast sour diesel.
[28:40.410 --> 28:46.530]  Every, yeah, every single strain we're smoking came from seed.
[28:46.530 --> 28:47.530]  Every one of them.
[28:47.530 --> 28:49.970]  I can't think of one strain that didn't come from seed.
[28:49.970 --> 28:54.650]  And if you can, I'll give you a hundred dollars.
[28:54.650 --> 28:58.850]  Because every fucking cannabis plant we were smoking came from a seed somewhere.
[28:58.850 --> 29:03.310]  If you grow out that bag seed, you could have a cup winner right there because a lot
[29:03.310 --> 29:07.070]  of times if you don't even know what it was bred with, that's yours.
[29:07.070 --> 29:08.630]  You don't have to give anybody credit.
[29:08.630 --> 29:09.630]  That's your seed.
[29:09.630 --> 29:10.630]  You found that.
[29:10.630 --> 29:12.930]  So you've got the, the Jesse's pride and joy now.
[29:12.930 --> 29:16.950]  And so when the cannabis cup winnings come up, they go and the winner for the most heady
[29:16.950 --> 29:22.790]  Indica here in Denver, Colorado, at the cannabis cup goes to Jesse for Jesse's mystery funk.
[29:22.790 --> 29:23.790]  And there you go, man.
[29:23.790 --> 29:27.650]  You just won that cannabis cup with a bag seed that you found.
[29:27.650 --> 29:28.650]  Chem dog did it.
[29:28.650 --> 29:29.650]  Didn't you?
[29:29.650 --> 29:30.650]  Yeah.
[29:30.650 --> 29:31.650]  True story.
[29:31.650 --> 29:32.650]  All right.
[29:32.650 --> 29:33.650]  I've been rambling a lot.
[29:33.650 --> 29:34.650]  I need a dab.
[29:34.650 --> 29:37.650]  And then I think we're thinking it might be, we've been going for close to 30 minutes here.
[29:37.650 --> 29:39.890]  We could probably start wrapping up this part, dude.
[29:39.890 --> 29:43.970]  All right, guys, we tried to wrap up this episode, but the conversation kept going.
[29:43.970 --> 29:47.750]  So what I decided to do was to make this a two part episode.
[29:47.750 --> 29:53.810]  So I will drop episode number 91 Thursday morning, and that will be part two of Jesse
[29:53.810 --> 29:54.810]  and I hanging out.
[29:54.810 --> 29:56.810]  So I want to thank you guys for listening to this episode.
[29:56.810 --> 29:58.970]  I hope you join us for part two.

[31:56.610 --> 31:58.770]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[31:58.770 --> 32:03.050]  It's time for episode number 91 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[32:03.050 --> 32:04.050]  news, education, and conversation.
[32:04.050 --> 32:05.050]  That's right.
[32:05.050 --> 32:09.810]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a hardcore
[32:09.810 --> 32:13.570]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[32:13.570 --> 32:17.130]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[32:17.130 --> 32:18.130]  I'm your host.
[32:18.130 --> 32:19.130]  They call me Rasta Jeff.
[32:19.130 --> 32:20.130]  Thanks again for joining me.
[32:20.130 --> 32:23.570]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for letting me play
[32:23.570 --> 32:25.010]  their music on my podcast.
[32:25.010 --> 32:28.130]  Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[32:28.130 --> 32:30.330]  You guys, I don't have any commercials for this week.
[32:30.330 --> 32:31.330]  I want to get right into the episode.
[32:31.330 --> 32:34.810]  Before we get started, I want to let you know that this is a part two episode.
[32:34.810 --> 32:37.970]  A few days ago, Jesse was here and we recorded for quite a while.
[32:37.970 --> 32:41.210]  I put up the first half of the conversation on Monday.
[32:41.210 --> 32:42.710]  This is part two.
[32:42.710 --> 32:43.710]  It starts off with me.
[32:43.710 --> 32:48.050]  I asked Jesse if he had any guidance or advice to give growers.
[32:48.050 --> 32:50.850]  And then we'll just jump into right where he started.
[32:50.850 --> 32:52.730]  Before we get there, I do want to make an apology.
[32:52.730 --> 32:56.770]  I posted episode 90 to iTunes and my website and Stitcher.
[32:56.770 --> 33:02.010]  And for some reason, episode 90 did not make it to Stitcher like it normally would have.
[33:02.010 --> 33:03.090]  That was not my issue.
[33:03.090 --> 33:04.470]  It was Stitcher's issue.
[33:04.470 --> 33:06.090]  They have since been emailed.
[33:06.090 --> 33:09.930]  As soon as Stitcher gets episode 90 up, I will post episode 91.
[33:09.930 --> 33:12.530]  I don't want to cause any confusion with Stitcher.
[33:12.530 --> 33:15.650]  I've emailed them and let them know that my latest episode did not post.
[33:15.650 --> 33:18.910]  I don't want to add another episode onto that and confuse them.
[33:18.910 --> 33:23.310]  As soon as Stitcher gets episode 90 out, episode 91 will be posted right after that.
[33:23.310 --> 33:24.750]  I appreciate you guys for being patient.
[33:24.750 --> 33:27.710]  I do apologize for any inconvenience that may have caused.
[33:27.710 --> 33:29.230]  I feel like I've been rambling enough.
[33:29.230 --> 33:30.350]  It's almost a two-minute intro.
[33:30.350 --> 33:32.990]  Let's get right down to the part where Jesse and I are talking.
[33:32.990 --> 33:33.990]  So here we go.
[33:33.990 --> 33:37.790]  I asked Jesse, I basically said, do you have any guidance that you would like to share
[33:37.790 --> 33:39.230]  with our listeners?
[33:39.230 --> 33:42.590]  And then here is what Jesse had to say.
[33:42.590 --> 33:44.310]  Don't sell junk clones.
[33:44.310 --> 33:45.430]  Don't sell junk clones.
[33:45.430 --> 33:46.910]  Don't sell untested seeds.
[33:46.910 --> 33:48.630]  Oh my God.
[33:48.630 --> 33:54.150]  Don't sell clones of plants from seed that you haven't even flowered yet.
[33:54.150 --> 33:55.150]  Yeah, definitely.
[33:55.150 --> 33:58.110]  I've heard so many horror stories at the growth store.
[33:58.110 --> 33:59.870]  I feel so bad for people.
[33:59.870 --> 34:03.910]  I can't help them, but it just really sucks.
[34:03.910 --> 34:05.710]  If you do that stuff, do it right.
[34:05.710 --> 34:09.110]  If you get a bag seed out of, what's this hash?
[34:09.110 --> 34:10.110]  This is Stardog.
[34:10.110 --> 34:14.550]  I'm taking a dab of Stardog from- Just give it to me.
[34:14.550 --> 34:16.790]  If you, what was I even going to say now?
[34:16.790 --> 34:17.990]  If you get a bag seed of it.
[34:18.350 --> 34:19.350]  And you grow it out.
[34:19.350 --> 34:25.950]  And then, oh, if you grow some weed and it's got a bunch of seeds in it, that Stardog plant,
[34:25.950 --> 34:30.270]  just because it's wholly seeded to fuck, doesn't mean you can call those seeds Stardog.
[34:30.270 --> 34:31.910]  Those are not Stardog seeds.
[34:31.910 --> 34:33.110]  No, not at all.
[34:33.110 --> 34:34.350]  Those are unknown seeds.
[34:34.350 --> 34:41.310]  Unless you hit that Stardog girl with male Stardog pollen or manipulated the plant in
[34:41.310 --> 34:45.710]  some other fashion to create S1 seeds.
[34:45.710 --> 34:46.710]  It does happen.
[34:46.710 --> 34:47.710]  Yeah.
[34:48.430 --> 34:50.030]  But if you don't know- It's still not exactly it.
[34:50.030 --> 34:51.030]  Right.
[34:51.030 --> 34:55.430]  But my thing is, if you don't know what did it, don't call it Stardog.
[34:55.430 --> 34:57.510]  Because it could be, there could have been some pollen in there.
[34:57.510 --> 34:59.870]  It could have been another one of the plants that hermed on it.
[34:59.870 --> 35:02.390]  It could have been a male in there.
[35:02.390 --> 35:06.150]  If all you had was seven Stardog plants in there, I guess you do have Stardog seeds.
[35:06.150 --> 35:10.350]  If you light stressed it and it produced a bunch of seeds, you do now have Stardog seed.
[35:10.350 --> 35:19.390]  It could have been a really special recessive clone phenotype and what comes out is the
[35:19.390 --> 35:20.830]  dominant piece of junk.
[35:20.830 --> 35:21.830]  Right.
[35:21.830 --> 35:22.830]  Yeah.
[35:22.830 --> 35:23.830]  Yeah.
[35:23.830 --> 35:24.830]  You're going to see grandpa when you grow up.
[35:24.830 --> 35:25.830]  You're going to see what the grandpa was.
[35:25.830 --> 35:29.550]  You're going to see what grandma was.
[35:29.550 --> 35:31.350]  Sometimes those plants were shitty or something.
[35:31.350 --> 35:32.630]  You just never know.
[35:32.630 --> 35:38.630]  A lot of what we have now, the plants that we're growing now are your dad's fault.
[35:38.630 --> 35:39.630]  You know what I mean?
[35:39.910 --> 35:42.910]  Jesse's dad is a whole time grower.
[35:42.910 --> 35:44.910]  They're the ones who chose these, some of the genetics were working out now.
[35:44.910 --> 35:46.910]  He actually did some breeding back then.
[35:46.910 --> 35:51.910]  They had to use, they had to steal streetlights and they had to use shitty soil and they had
[35:51.910 --> 35:52.910]  to hide.
[35:52.910 --> 35:53.910]  They couldn't run too much electricity.
[35:53.910 --> 35:56.350]  They didn't know what the hell they were looking for.
[35:56.350 --> 35:58.190]  They had the shittiest books.
[35:58.190 --> 36:00.790]  Everything in the books back then was hand drawn.
[36:00.790 --> 36:04.990]  People were still, they were stealing electricity back then.
[36:04.990 --> 36:05.990]  Yeah.
[36:05.990 --> 36:09.870]  They had to hand drawn books that you had to go to shady ass head shops to buy.
[36:09.870 --> 36:10.870]  Shout out to Mel Frank.
[36:10.870 --> 36:14.710]  All right, I'm going to take this dab here and then we'll start doing this.
[36:14.710 --> 36:18.790]  But yeah, those, that generation is responsible for the plants that we have now.
[36:18.790 --> 36:22.510]  Those guys, some of the guys that went to war in other countries brought back seeds
[36:22.510 --> 36:23.550]  from those regions.
[36:23.550 --> 36:24.550]  They grew those seeds.
[36:24.550 --> 36:26.110]  They found that some were too damn tall.
[36:26.110 --> 36:29.750]  They found that some took way too long and they got rid of them.
[36:29.750 --> 36:34.550]  And I bet you bro, I bet there, now that we've got room and space and lights and technology,
[36:34.550 --> 36:37.470]  I bet some of the gold was thrown the fuck away.
[36:37.470 --> 36:39.350]  Oh, I guarantee.
[36:39.350 --> 36:43.950]  If you've got a bag of old school seeds, if you're like 50 or 60 years old and you've
[36:43.950 --> 36:48.030]  got a big sandwich bag full of seeds that you had when you were, let's see, I want to
[36:48.030 --> 36:49.710]  go back to the seventies.
[36:49.710 --> 36:55.270]  So you got some 35 year old seeds, uh, 40 year old seeds and you want to share them.
[36:55.270 --> 37:00.190]  Uh, send Jesse and I a sandwich baggie full and we will grow the shit out of them and
[37:00.190 --> 37:04.070]  we'll take pictures and we'll give you a clone of our favorite shit out of that.
[37:04.590 --> 37:07.190]  I got some, uh, pretty old seeds the other day.
[37:07.190 --> 37:15.430]  Shout out to a Mr. G and uh, uh, I can't remember his, uh, um, uh, Llama box.
[37:15.430 --> 37:16.430]  Llama box.
[37:16.430 --> 37:17.430]  Yeah.
[37:17.430 --> 37:18.430]  Thanks for the hookup guys.
[37:18.430 --> 37:20.710]  I've heard of Llama box is very familiar.
[37:20.710 --> 37:21.710]  Do I know?
[37:21.710 --> 37:22.710]  Oh yeah.
[37:22.710 --> 37:28.310]  He won a, uh, yeah, he was one of the winners for the, the 50 show.
[37:28.310 --> 37:29.310]  That is true.
[37:29.310 --> 37:31.950]  And his little Twitter icon is a little llama getting crazy.
[37:31.950 --> 37:32.950]  Yeah.
[37:32.950 --> 37:33.950]  I knew I remembered that.
[37:34.830 --> 37:35.830]  I was taking a dab and that still made sense to me.
[37:35.830 --> 37:38.270]  Shout out to green and healthy wellness.
[37:38.270 --> 37:41.510]  Um, while I'm thinking about it, you guys, I wrote down to say this, I was supposed to
[37:41.510 --> 37:44.830]  say it in the intro, but I just took a dab and I want to make sure I don't forget green
[37:44.830 --> 37:46.990]  and healthy wellness is not closed forever.
[37:46.990 --> 37:48.230]  No, I know.
[37:48.230 --> 37:49.910]  I hyped this shop in Colorado spring.
[37:49.910 --> 37:50.910]  Shout out to hunt.
[37:50.910 --> 37:51.910]  Shout out to damsel.
[37:51.910 --> 37:52.910]  Shout out to Haley.
[37:52.910 --> 37:58.030]  Shout out to Jordan, Jordan's and John Randall's junior.
[37:58.030 --> 38:00.110]  But they had to shut their doors for a little while.
[38:00.110 --> 38:03.430]  The building, I don't know how much of this business is mind to air the building in which
[38:03.910 --> 38:06.630]  they were located was sold and the new owner did not want a dispensary.
[38:06.630 --> 38:08.230]  That was basically the story.
[38:08.230 --> 38:09.550]  So they were forced to move.
[38:09.550 --> 38:11.390]  They do have a new location.
[38:11.390 --> 38:14.830]  By the time you hear this, it is likely that they're open to back for business.
[38:14.830 --> 38:19.150]  And if they are not, trust me, you guys, green and healthy wellness as fast as they can.
[38:19.150 --> 38:23.230]  Dude, I saw them working to tear down the building and it was like army ants and they're
[38:23.230 --> 38:24.470]  just going buck wild.
[38:24.470 --> 38:25.770]  It was crazy.
[38:25.770 --> 38:27.670]  Everybody was sweaty and had this stressful look.
[38:27.670 --> 38:29.470]  So they're getting to grow too.
[38:29.470 --> 38:30.470]  They moved everything.
[38:30.470 --> 38:31.470]  Oh shit.
[38:31.470 --> 38:32.470]  Yeah.
[38:32.510 --> 38:33.510]  I'm going to get burned.
[38:33.510 --> 38:34.510]  Yeah.
[38:34.510 --> 38:35.830]  So they are eager to get the new facility open.
[38:35.830 --> 38:36.830]  They're not gone forever.
[38:36.830 --> 38:39.950]  You guys the turpex hookup at green and healthy wellness will be back.
[38:39.950 --> 38:41.190]  Denzel will be back.
[38:41.190 --> 38:42.190]  I understand.
[38:42.190 --> 38:44.830]  If I understand it right, they actually got a better building.
[38:44.830 --> 38:46.190]  They got a better location.
[38:46.190 --> 38:47.390]  It's a little bigger.
[38:47.390 --> 38:48.510]  That building was a little tight.
[38:48.510 --> 38:50.950]  The parking would get a little cramped in there sometimes.
[38:50.950 --> 38:55.330]  Yeah, so they will be back and it will be better than ever.
[38:55.330 --> 38:57.670]  They do apologize for the inconvenience.
[38:57.670 --> 39:00.470]  We know that a lot of people rely on them for their medicine.
[39:00.470 --> 39:03.430]  They are a medical only shop.
[39:03.430 --> 39:06.230]  So a lot of patients are looking for a new spot for medicine.
[39:06.230 --> 39:07.230]  They'll be back.
[39:07.230 --> 39:08.230]  You guys, I promise.
[39:08.230 --> 39:09.230]  I certainly promise.
[39:09.230 --> 39:10.230]  Big shout out to hunt.
[39:10.230 --> 39:13.110]  Hunt was here the other day at the house and hung out and we did make promises to record
[39:13.110 --> 39:15.390]  together very soon.
[39:15.390 --> 39:18.150]  That episode will feature the lovely dude.
[39:18.150 --> 39:19.150]  It's damsel.
[39:19.150 --> 39:20.150]  My favorite suicide girl.
[39:20.150 --> 39:21.150]  So that'll be nice.
[39:21.150 --> 39:22.150]  Yeah.
[39:22.150 --> 39:24.670]  She's a little famous on the interweb.
[39:24.670 --> 39:25.670]  You know, she is a little popular.
[39:25.670 --> 39:27.230]  She gave me a shout out.
[39:27.230 --> 39:30.350]  I sent her a, I took, I'm sure I've talked about it on the show.
[39:31.230 --> 39:32.550]  I'm growing a strain called damsels dank.
[39:32.550 --> 39:34.070]  I'm hunting from seed.
[39:34.070 --> 39:38.390]  I'm running three different seed lines of stuff that I've crossed and I'm looking to
[39:38.390 --> 39:42.550]  find her favorite phenotype and then we're going to name that one damsels dank and it's
[39:42.550 --> 39:47.670]  going to be marketed at the dispensary that I represent and the dispensary that she represents.
[39:47.670 --> 39:52.470]  And so I took a picture of the seedling and sent it to her and I said the beginning and
[39:52.470 --> 39:57.350]  she put that on Instagram and within an hour I had a hundred new followers.
[39:57.350 --> 39:58.350]  Jesus.
[39:58.350 --> 39:59.350]  Yeah.
[39:59.350 --> 40:00.350]  So I sent it to her and she said, dude, it's damsel.
[40:00.350 --> 40:03.070]  That's my favorite suicide girl.
[40:03.070 --> 40:04.070]  That's hard to pick.
[40:04.070 --> 40:07.310]  Yeah, that'll be a, yeah, I bet that'll be a little bit popular.
[40:07.310 --> 40:09.110]  That'll get some stuff going for both of us.
[40:09.110 --> 40:10.110]  Yeah.
[40:10.110 --> 40:11.110]  It'll expose both brands.
[40:11.110 --> 40:15.710]  I have genetics, the suicide girls, dude, it's damsel.
[40:15.710 --> 40:16.710]  Clint will be part of that.
[40:16.710 --> 40:19.830]  The Grammy Gatsby will be part of advertising green and healthy wellness will be carrying
[40:19.830 --> 40:21.030]  the flowers for sure.
[40:21.030 --> 40:25.030]  In the near future, the spot will have the flowers, but you guys, this is a year long
[40:25.030 --> 40:26.030]  project.
[40:26.030 --> 40:29.030]  Don't think there's something, this is something that's going to happen in a few weeks.
[40:29.710 --> 40:31.390]  We bred a seed line.
[40:31.390 --> 40:33.310]  We bred three seed lines.
[40:33.310 --> 40:36.430]  We took those seed lines, they germinated, they are now in veg.
[40:36.430 --> 40:38.790]  They just got put into three gallon pots.
[40:38.790 --> 40:44.390]  I've got to run, I think 22 of them out of the original, I think 30 started.
[40:44.390 --> 40:47.550]  22 of them have made it to where I think they'll make it to the flower room.
[40:47.550 --> 40:49.710]  I may take one or two out.
[40:49.710 --> 40:51.390]  One's too tall and lanky.
[40:51.390 --> 40:52.390]  It's a boy.
[40:52.390 --> 40:53.390]  I can tell just by looking.
[40:53.390 --> 40:56.790]  So I kind of want to just pull that one, but then they'll flower.
[40:56.790 --> 40:59.350]  Once they're flowered, there's a private party set up.
[40:59.350 --> 41:00.790]  The date's already been chosen.
[41:00.790 --> 41:04.630]  There's a location being put together and the Grammy Gatsby is going to throw a tasting
[41:04.630 --> 41:09.230]  party and there will be score cards and video done and full on reviews.
[41:09.230 --> 41:12.070]  So yeah, we're taking this one quite seriously.
[41:12.070 --> 41:13.070]  And this just a pheno hunt.
[41:13.070 --> 41:16.070]  Imagine if he was actually taking the seeds to market.
[41:16.070 --> 41:17.070]  Right.
[41:17.070 --> 41:18.230]  It's a two year project.
[41:18.230 --> 41:19.230]  Yeah, exactly.
[41:19.230 --> 41:22.590]  Because I would want to run at least a hundred of those seeds myself.
[41:22.590 --> 41:26.190]  After I ran 20 or 50 of them myself, I would start sending 10 packs out to friends.
[41:26.590 --> 41:27.590]  I'd give you 10 of them.
[41:27.590 --> 41:28.590]  Like, grow these now.
[41:28.590 --> 41:29.590]  Don't fuck around.
[41:29.590 --> 41:30.590]  Grow these now.
[41:30.590 --> 41:32.270]  Send them out to friends that are eager to grow.
[41:32.270 --> 41:33.790]  They would grow them right away.
[41:33.790 --> 41:34.790]  They would send me pictures.
[41:34.790 --> 41:35.790]  They would send me feedback.
[41:35.790 --> 41:40.190]  If they're local, I get to go to Rasta Ralph's garden and look at my Blue Healer growing.
[41:40.190 --> 41:44.710]  I get to go to people's places and see my plants growing in their garden to get feedback,
[41:44.710 --> 41:46.990]  which improves my breeding.
[41:46.990 --> 41:50.270]  Because then I can say, oh God, I never want to breed with that fucking plant ever again.
[41:50.270 --> 41:52.230]  What is the Blue Healer?
[41:52.230 --> 41:54.310]  Blue Healer is the blue dream.
[41:54.310 --> 41:55.310]  The grateful dog.
[41:55.430 --> 41:56.430]  Oh, okay.
[41:56.430 --> 41:57.430]  Shout out to Spencer for the name.
[41:57.430 --> 42:00.030]  I was like, I'm going to cross the blue dream and the grateful dog.
[42:00.030 --> 42:01.030]  And he goes, that's Blue Healer.
[42:01.030 --> 42:03.070]  He just spit it out like it was nothing.
[42:03.070 --> 42:04.070]  So that's the name it got.
[42:04.070 --> 42:07.750]  Yeah, he got packs of seeds for that.
[42:07.750 --> 42:10.150]  I don't think I've ever grown a blue dream cross.
[42:10.150 --> 42:12.990]  It's not my favorite strain in the world, to be honest.
[42:12.990 --> 42:14.790]  That was kind of my goal.
[42:14.790 --> 42:18.990]  Colorado was in love with blue dream and the girls in California are in love with blue
[42:18.990 --> 42:19.990]  dream.
[42:19.990 --> 42:21.030]  It's a cash crop plant.
[42:21.030 --> 42:26.550]  It does have some additional value, but it's used too much here as a cash crop plant.
[42:26.550 --> 42:33.350]  For what it is, it's, and I forgot the cross of it suddenly, that it's blueberry and silver
[42:33.350 --> 42:34.350]  haze.
[42:34.350 --> 42:35.350]  Yeah, yeah.
[42:35.350 --> 42:38.830]  It's by DJ Short's son or something like that, isn't it?
[42:38.830 --> 42:39.830]  JD Short.
[42:39.830 --> 42:41.470]  Or his son-in-law or something like that.
[42:41.470 --> 42:44.830]  I'm not sure if that's actually true because that's up for debate.
[42:44.830 --> 42:47.630]  Guys, if you know the truth of where the blue dream came from, let me know because I've
[42:47.630 --> 42:49.270]  heard a couple of stories.
[42:49.270 --> 42:52.870]  It's a haze and it's a blue dream and it's got some OG, I think, in there.
[42:52.870 --> 42:56.230]  You would think from what I've read, I remember thinking that would be the ideal strain.
[42:56.230 --> 42:59.230]  But then I remember getting my hands on a couple of different grows of it and smoking
[42:59.230 --> 43:00.230]  it and being like, this is mediocre.
[43:00.230 --> 43:03.710]  I've heard there's an amazing fucking phenotype of it.
[43:03.710 --> 43:07.030]  The Andes blue dream phenotype is the most impressive I've seen.
[43:07.030 --> 43:08.030]  Yeah, wow.
[43:08.030 --> 43:09.510]  It's just a phenotype, you guys.
[43:09.510 --> 43:10.510]  It's labeled ABD.
[43:10.510 --> 43:11.510]  It's Andes blue dream.
[43:11.510 --> 43:13.510]  I tend to think that's just the blue dream that's everywhere.
[43:13.510 --> 43:14.510]  Yeah, it's all over Colorado.
[43:14.510 --> 43:15.510]  Oh, okay, okay.
[43:15.510 --> 43:16.510]  That's the one I bred with.
[43:16.510 --> 43:17.510]  I'm pretty sure it's the one I bred too.
[43:17.510 --> 43:18.510]  Yeah.
[43:18.750 --> 43:23.910]  But the blue dream kicks out, you can pull two pounds under a thousand watt light and
[43:23.910 --> 43:25.310]  soil with that blue dream cut.
[43:25.310 --> 43:26.310]  Oh, easily.
[43:26.310 --> 43:27.750]  With a short, short veg time.
[43:27.750 --> 43:31.230]  We did one with a real short veg time last year outdoors.
[43:31.230 --> 43:33.070]  It did like three and a half pounds.
[43:33.070 --> 43:34.070]  Yeah.
[43:34.070 --> 43:35.070]  I mean.
[43:35.070 --> 43:39.310]  But the problem is it doesn't have an appealing high to me and it doesn't make enough hash
[43:39.310 --> 43:42.870]  to make it worth its time, space, energy, nutrients, whatever else.
[43:42.870 --> 43:43.870]  You know what I mean?
[43:43.870 --> 43:47.190]  I can replace that with a bounty killer and have way better medicine.
[43:47.190 --> 43:51.550]  If it smelled like it, or if it tasted like it smelled, it'd be the most popular strain
[43:51.550 --> 43:52.550]  in the world.
[43:52.550 --> 43:53.550]  I thought.
[43:53.550 --> 43:57.070]  Well, my goal when I hit it with the grateful dog was to put that resin on it.
[43:57.070 --> 43:58.070]  That was, and it worked.
[43:58.070 --> 43:59.070]  It definitely worked.
[43:59.070 --> 44:02.790]  It made it short into the flowering time that made the plants a little stockier and it put
[44:02.790 --> 44:06.990]  some resin and a little bit of funk to it, which was what all, that's all the blue dream
[44:06.990 --> 44:10.550]  was missing was resin and funk and it was getting too tall for a lot of indoor grows.
[44:10.550 --> 44:13.350]  Oh, I bet the DJ short came out.
[44:13.350 --> 44:18.230]  I mean, anything with his stuff's always seems to be really dominant.
[44:18.230 --> 44:25.110]  A lot, you know, this has a lot for his breeding because he's taken it to the F five before
[44:25.110 --> 44:27.950]  he releases his packages, which is pretty impressive.
[44:27.950 --> 44:30.790]  And he has a style of his own.
[44:30.790 --> 44:35.710]  I've heard him argue with many people on podcasts and interviews.
[44:35.710 --> 44:36.710]  Yes.
[44:36.710 --> 44:40.550]  You know, a couple of minutes ago I dissed the old generation.
[44:40.550 --> 44:42.910]  DJ short is the old generation, bro.
[44:43.470 --> 44:44.470]  We got to give him mad love.
[44:44.470 --> 44:47.390]  He's one of the guys back in the day that was doing it right for genetics.
[44:47.390 --> 44:50.630]  If it weren't for DJ short, I don't think you and I would be where we are in the cannabis
[44:50.630 --> 44:51.630]  game.
[44:51.630 --> 44:52.630]  No, I don't think anyone would be.
[44:52.630 --> 44:57.110]  I mean, yeah, DJ has done a lot for the preservation and just everything.
[44:57.110 --> 45:01.230]  It's, I might be a brick in the wall, but DJ short was part of the foundation.
[45:01.230 --> 45:02.230]  Oh yeah.
[45:02.230 --> 45:03.230]  Boom.
[45:03.230 --> 45:04.230]  Cornerstone.
[45:04.230 --> 45:05.230]  Yes.
[45:05.230 --> 45:08.470]  It's up there with some of the original authors and stuff like that.
[45:08.470 --> 45:10.270]  And we're guys like that.
[45:10.270 --> 45:11.270]  Yeah.
[45:11.270 --> 45:12.710]  Um, I'll give sub cool man credit.
[45:13.510 --> 45:17.390]  So he's not as old as sub cool or as a DJ short, but he's in that generation between
[45:17.390 --> 45:18.990]  them, between us and DJ.
[45:18.990 --> 45:22.230]  So we've got to give him mad love for his breeding and for what he did for the community
[45:22.230 --> 45:23.830]  also since we're shut down readers.
[45:23.830 --> 45:27.710]  And if we're going to go with old guys, you guys know I'm going to say it.
[45:27.710 --> 45:29.070]  Soma deserves a high five.
[45:29.070 --> 45:30.070]  Oh fuck yeah.
[45:30.070 --> 45:31.070]  Yeah.
[45:31.070 --> 45:32.070]  Big namaste to Soma.
[45:32.070 --> 45:34.310]  Soma taught me how to grow on OG.
[45:34.310 --> 45:39.630]  I did not know anything about, I'd never, I'd read Soma's posts, but I never realized
[45:39.630 --> 45:41.910]  he was a dreadlock and I never knew he was a dirty hippie.
[45:42.110 --> 45:45.670]  And I didn't know he had amethyst everywhere and crystals on everything.
[45:45.870 --> 45:47.670]  I figured he was an Indian dude.
[45:48.550 --> 45:50.510]  Like the country India.
[45:50.510 --> 45:50.990]  Yeah.
[45:50.990 --> 45:57.670]  And my friend Donovan one day, uh, who was a big user of overgrow.com, uh, he was always
[45:57.670 --> 45:57.990]  on there.
[45:57.990 --> 46:01.510]  And one day he's like, bro, you remind me so much of Soma the way that you talk, because
[46:01.510 --> 46:03.950]  I was preaching my grow from your heart theory.
[46:03.950 --> 46:04.390]  You know what I mean?
[46:04.390 --> 46:05.510]  Like go in your grow room.
[46:05.510 --> 46:08.950]  And I still think this, you got to go in your grow room once in a while and just sit there
[46:08.950 --> 46:12.470]  and just meditate and just close your eyes and think about the goodness that those plants
[46:12.470 --> 46:16.710]  are going to do, because you're growing a plant that is going to heal somebody in some
[46:16.710 --> 46:17.190]  sort of way.
[46:17.190 --> 46:18.110]  They're going to feel better.
[46:18.110 --> 46:21.550]  Even if they're a recreational smoker, if they're a medical smoker, somebody is going
[46:21.550 --> 46:24.790]  to be uplifted and better because of the product that you're growing.
[46:24.790 --> 46:26.230]  And that's got to feel good inside.
[46:26.670 --> 46:30.030]  So I go in there and kind of meditate a little bit on that and feel that golden.
[46:30.110 --> 46:30.750]  We'd share it.
[46:31.030 --> 46:31.830]  The plants love me.
[46:31.830 --> 46:32.550]  I love them.
[46:32.550 --> 46:33.710]  And then they heal somebody else.
[46:33.710 --> 46:35.350]  And then that person hugs me when they see me.
[46:35.350 --> 46:37.830]  And the next time they go, dude, that grateful dog was so good.
[46:38.590 --> 46:41.590]  And then I get to go grow better weed because I just got a good hug and it just
[46:41.590 --> 46:43.430]  perpetuates this golden cycle.
[46:43.670 --> 46:46.750]  So I was talking about that exact hippie shit that I just said.
[46:46.750 --> 46:48.670]  And my buddy's like, dude, you're like fucking Soma.
[46:48.910 --> 46:49.910]  And I was like, I've heard of Soma.
[46:49.910 --> 46:50.870]  I've read his post.
[46:50.870 --> 46:52.110]  And he's like, no, go get his book.
[46:52.390 --> 46:53.350]  And I went and got his book.
[46:53.350 --> 46:57.590]  And I was like, this guy is who I was going to be in 20 years if I didn't know.
[46:57.830 --> 47:01.550]  I was already this guy, you know, like I was already on the path of being Soma.
[47:01.550 --> 47:02.270]  So much respect.
[47:02.430 --> 47:04.950]  We just got off on a random tangent of giving DJ Short.
[47:04.950 --> 47:08.710]  He did no till organic before any of y'all thought of it.
[47:09.670 --> 47:12.670]  As cool as it is, no one's doing nothing new there.
[47:13.310 --> 47:14.190]  True. Yes.
[47:14.190 --> 47:15.030]  So it's been a time.
[47:15.030 --> 47:17.270]  The the bed's like his.
[47:17.350 --> 47:20.550]  I built him out of rubber made containers, but I used the same,
[47:20.750 --> 47:23.270]  you know, principle with the drainage and everything.
[47:23.310 --> 47:26.550]  And I can support 99 percent of what Soma says.
[47:27.030 --> 47:28.710]  Sub cool. I love his growing style.
[47:28.710 --> 47:31.150]  Sometimes he says some shit that I'm not going to put my signature on.
[47:31.150 --> 47:32.550]  Yeah. But you know what?
[47:32.550 --> 47:34.150]  I don't I don't discredit that.
[47:34.150 --> 47:35.590]  The dude's got fucking integrity.
[47:35.590 --> 47:40.470]  He's made a lot of strains and he was one of the first people to take good pictures
[47:42.430 --> 47:45.550]  with a good camera, but and send them into high times.
[47:45.670 --> 47:49.310]  Anybody that's followed me on Facebook since the beginning knows
[47:49.310 --> 47:53.670]  without any saying that fucking sub cool inspired 50 percent of my photography.
[47:53.870 --> 47:55.510]  That's where I got a lot of the idea.
[47:55.510 --> 47:58.190]  You guys have a real similar style now that you mention it.
[47:58.310 --> 48:02.070]  Our gross style, our photography style, like the whole thing is kind of.
[48:02.550 --> 48:05.110]  I didn't know that until someone's like, you should check out the Weedner.
[48:05.110 --> 48:08.830]  And I was like, OK, there's a lot to learn in some of his older episodes.
[48:08.830 --> 48:11.070]  If you're interested in the way he does things.
[48:11.110 --> 48:14.150]  Yeah. Sub cool on the YouTube, the YouTube.
[48:14.150 --> 48:15.390]  I sound like an old guy when I say that.
[48:15.390 --> 48:17.390]  The Weedner, the Weedner. Yeah. Check that out.
[48:17.390 --> 48:19.030]  The older stuff is really good.
[48:19.030 --> 48:23.030]  There came a point when it got to be too redundant, redundant.
[48:23.030 --> 48:26.950]  And he had been even he even he knows that he says it all the time.
[48:26.990 --> 48:29.150]  And I'm getting to a hundred episodes.
[48:29.310 --> 48:31.390]  And there's only so much you could talk about about cannabis.
[48:31.390 --> 48:33.190]  You know what I mean? Like there's always news and stuff.
[48:33.190 --> 48:34.910]  So that's why I fall to the news sometimes.
[48:34.910 --> 48:38.510]  But it's going to be now that once we get to episode one hundred,
[48:38.510 --> 48:39.750]  we're going to go a little more in depth.
[48:39.750 --> 48:42.990]  I've gone through the basics and now it's time to dig in a little bit.
[48:42.990 --> 48:46.870]  I think our friends, our listeners, Periscope, I think that's a really great
[48:46.870 --> 48:50.990]  tool for a podcast. OK, so I've been opening Periscope and doing random shit
[48:50.990 --> 48:52.230]  on there occasionally.
[48:52.230 --> 48:55.390]  But now that we've got this good foundation, you guys have had your basic
[48:55.390 --> 48:56.430]  rudimentary classes.
[48:56.430 --> 48:59.270]  I think it's almost time around episode one hundred to start pushing it
[48:59.270 --> 49:01.070]  and start going to the B-level courses.
[49:01.070 --> 49:03.310]  We're in a college level. You guys are pretty soon.
[49:03.310 --> 49:05.790]  We'll get Sean back. You'll have to get out the notepad again.
[49:05.790 --> 49:07.750]  We're going to do this right once.
[49:07.750 --> 49:09.710]  Yeah. All right.
[49:09.710 --> 49:10.990]  So we're going to wrap this part up.
[49:10.990 --> 49:11.910]  We've been going for a long time.
[49:11.910 --> 49:13.270]  Dude, Jesse, thanks for coming, man.
[49:13.270 --> 49:14.790]  Oh, yeah. No problem.
[49:14.790 --> 49:17.750]  Oh, let's see. Let's do the outdoor update real quick. OK.
[49:18.630 --> 49:22.990]  Here lately in southern Colorado, at least it has been cold and humid
[49:22.990 --> 49:25.190]  at night and hot and dry during the day.
[49:26.190 --> 49:28.270]  That is a recipe for powdery mold.
[49:28.910 --> 49:30.710]  So, Budrat.
[49:33.030 --> 49:35.630]  It's part of the reason Cali Bud stands out.
[49:35.630 --> 49:37.550]  They get a marine layer with this, too.
[49:37.550 --> 49:42.310]  But, you know, this year I've seen some a lot of Cali style
[49:42.510 --> 49:46.830]  or what I always call Cali style problems that we've never had here before.
[49:47.510 --> 49:50.110]  So be prepared for that stuff.
[49:50.110 --> 49:53.510]  How can we prevent getting powdery mildew with these crispy cold nights
[49:53.510 --> 49:54.030]  that we're getting?
[49:54.030 --> 49:55.590]  There's a lot of moisture in the air tonight.
[49:55.590 --> 49:56.430]  I can already feel it.
[49:56.470 --> 49:59.750]  Yeah, there's I mean, any number of things.
[50:00.070 --> 50:02.270]  I'm personally using actinovate.
[50:02.270 --> 50:04.190]  I mean, we're in bloom, too.
[50:05.750 --> 50:08.470]  But it's you know, it's I see it on the cucumbers.
[50:08.470 --> 50:09.790]  I see it on the squash.
[50:09.790 --> 50:12.350]  I see it on the watermelon.
[50:12.350 --> 50:14.190]  That's a different strain.
[50:14.190 --> 50:16.750]  It doesn't really affect
[50:16.750 --> 50:19.470]  cannabis from what I've seen and been told.
[50:21.150 --> 50:23.790]  But to me, it's an indication that the
[50:24.270 --> 50:26.310]  the climate for it to grow is.
[50:26.350 --> 50:28.670]  Oh, yeah. Is present. Yes.
[50:28.670 --> 50:33.190]  I can't speak on that now, but in the next within the next 30 days,
[50:33.190 --> 50:36.150]  I am going to become what is called applicator certified
[50:36.150 --> 50:37.750]  by the Department of Agriculture.
[50:37.750 --> 50:39.910]  Nice. My cousin's up. Yeah, it's.
[50:40.550 --> 50:42.270]  It seems that I've looked at the test.
[50:42.270 --> 50:44.590]  It seems to be fairly easy. It's an open book test.
[50:45.510 --> 50:46.870]  Somebody that works.
[50:46.870 --> 50:48.710]  I'm now the lead grower.
[50:48.710 --> 50:52.150]  Myself and my friend John are now the lead growers at the spot dispensary.
[50:52.590 --> 50:56.310]  And today we had our first pre inspection from the Department of Agriculture
[50:56.310 --> 51:00.110]  before we grow anything in there in our new grow areas. Wow.
[51:00.630 --> 51:04.150]  Dude, it's I've only been out of the industry for nine months.
[51:04.190 --> 51:07.110]  And wow, things have changed. Yes. Yes.
[51:07.150 --> 51:09.390]  You have to have a Department of Agriculture meetings.
[51:09.630 --> 51:11.230]  There's about an hour and a half long meeting.
[51:11.230 --> 51:15.790]  They told us basically what we need to do to be compliant, which is
[51:16.230 --> 51:17.150]  it's all basic stuff.
[51:17.150 --> 51:20.950]  And it's mostly since the spot was designed, what's the shit that we're already doing?
[51:21.950 --> 51:24.430]  But you have to have one at least one person
[51:25.110 --> 51:28.790]  on the staff that can train employees on
[51:29.630 --> 51:33.310]  pesticide and insecticide and fungicide safety. Good.
[51:33.550 --> 51:36.590]  Yeah. And so I took it upon myself to say, hey, I'm lead grower.
[51:36.590 --> 51:37.790]  I'll go do this. Nice.
[51:37.790 --> 51:40.910]  And it's the boss is going to pay for it, of course, because it's a work related
[51:40.910 --> 51:43.270]  thing. And it's something that I feel like I should do anyway.
[51:43.550 --> 51:45.590]  Like when they offered that course, I was like, I want to go to this.
[51:45.590 --> 51:47.710]  I want to go to this. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's.
[51:48.310 --> 51:49.910]  That's great, man.
[51:49.910 --> 51:52.070]  Within 30 days, I will.
[51:52.070 --> 51:52.990]  I have to take the test.
[51:52.990 --> 51:54.190]  Kudos to the spot, too.
[51:54.190 --> 51:58.270]  I know some owners would be really pissed about having to do shit like this. Right.
[51:59.110 --> 52:01.190]  You got to in the cannabis industry.
[52:01.190 --> 52:03.350]  Heard of you got to you got to
[52:04.550 --> 52:07.950]  allegedly you got to spend money to fucking make money in the cannabis industry.
[52:07.950 --> 52:10.630]  You guys. Yeah, it is hard to survive right now
[52:10.630 --> 52:13.030]  if you don't have some money to put in inventory.
[52:13.230 --> 52:16.790]  If your shelves aren't stocked with 20 different kinds of buds,
[52:16.910 --> 52:19.630]  if your shelves aren't stocked with 20 different kinds of edibles,
[52:19.910 --> 52:23.910]  four different topicals, a lollipop over here, some T-shirts over here,
[52:24.350 --> 52:25.550]  socks over here.
[52:25.550 --> 52:29.190]  You guys got to fill your Chinese water pipes. Yeah.
[52:29.190 --> 52:30.670]  Yeah. Good water pipes.
[52:30.670 --> 52:31.670]  Chinese water pipes.
[52:31.670 --> 52:33.110]  Knockoff nails. High end.
[52:33.110 --> 52:35.270]  Shout out to three rivers organics.
[52:35.270 --> 52:37.710]  I got some cool hitman shit in there.
[52:37.750 --> 52:40.270]  Wow. Your eyes are really red.
[52:40.270 --> 52:44.750]  I just yeah, just over here coughing and only saying short sentences.
[52:45.150 --> 52:47.670]  All right. Does it match my my red in my shirt yet?
[52:47.670 --> 52:49.990]  Pretty close. Nice.
[52:49.990 --> 52:52.030]  Back to the outdoor. Yes, let's go.
[52:52.910 --> 52:55.710]  But yeah, actinovate
[52:57.110 --> 52:57.830]  green cure.
[52:57.830 --> 53:00.750]  I don't really see that as a preventative.
[53:01.910 --> 53:06.150]  But if you do use it, make sure you use it at night and follow the directions.
[53:08.030 --> 53:09.390]  What do you know?
[53:09.390 --> 53:11.430]  There's all kinds of stuff you can be spraying on it.
[53:11.630 --> 53:15.070]  Just get it. Get a good one.
[53:15.070 --> 53:17.630]  Just stay away from neem oil.
[53:17.750 --> 53:20.710]  Since it's all your plants should be in bloom.
[53:21.390 --> 53:25.510]  Yeah. I was gifted a product called stylet oil.
[53:26.830 --> 53:27.630]  I've heard of it.
[53:27.630 --> 53:30.950]  I did a consultation and somebody, an older gentleman
[53:31.710 --> 53:35.550]  who is not as able bodied as most of us, he's a little he's a little slower.
[53:35.550 --> 53:36.870]  You might call him handicapped.
[53:36.870 --> 53:38.110]  He's trying to grow his own cannabis.
[53:38.110 --> 53:39.310]  It's his first grow.
[53:39.310 --> 53:40.670]  It's the second grow.
[53:40.670 --> 53:44.350]  And I give him a free consultation and he had just the starts of powdery mildew.
[53:44.750 --> 53:49.470]  And I was like, man, I and he was in about starting week three of flower.
[53:50.110 --> 53:53.110]  And I was like, man, I don't really want you to spray anything on there,
[53:53.110 --> 53:55.230]  but you're going to lose your crop if you don't.
[53:55.830 --> 53:59.190]  And he said, I Googled some stuff and they say oils and things.
[53:59.190 --> 54:01.270]  And I said, don't put neem oil on there.
[54:01.270 --> 54:04.190]  I said, put some worm casting tea on there.
[54:04.630 --> 54:07.150]  The work didn't do a damn thing.
[54:07.150 --> 54:09.030]  That's most definitely preventative.
[54:09.030 --> 54:11.350]  I mean, yeah, yeah, it didn't do shit.
[54:11.670 --> 54:15.510]  So I told him, I said, well, you're going to this crop is going to be fucked
[54:15.510 --> 54:17.670]  because the powdery mildew was getting it wasn't thick,
[54:17.670 --> 54:19.950]  but you could see it popping up in the little circles.
[54:19.950 --> 54:24.670]  And so I said, yeah, I've got a product called stylet oil that I've never used.
[54:24.670 --> 54:27.790]  And a friend of mine sent it to me to encourage me to use it.
[54:28.110 --> 54:31.550]  And he said that it will destroy powdery mildew on contact.
[54:31.790 --> 54:33.470]  And he said, spray it on there.
[54:33.470 --> 54:34.310]  And he's an old dude.
[54:34.310 --> 54:36.390]  I said, this is your medicine that you're in.
[54:36.390 --> 54:38.270]  He said, yes, I know I need this.
[54:38.270 --> 54:39.390]  Spray that on there.
[54:39.390 --> 54:42.190]  He knew what I was doing and it was it was his decision.
[54:42.510 --> 54:44.390]  I sprayed the stylet oil on there.
[54:44.390 --> 54:47.350]  That shit took down the powdery mildew on contact.
[54:47.390 --> 54:48.550]  It destroyed it.
[54:48.550 --> 54:50.470]  Nice. Nice. I've never actually used it.
[54:50.470 --> 54:53.670]  I've heard you can burn the shit out some plants with it.
[54:53.710 --> 54:56.470]  Absolutely. That's one of the things a guy named.
[54:56.750 --> 54:58.630]  I don't know if I should say his real name.
[54:58.630 --> 55:01.870]  He's known as tree town is what I know him as a tree town farmer.
[55:02.110 --> 55:04.430]  He's the one that recommended this to me and hooked me up with it.
[55:04.470 --> 55:06.030]  It was a vendor for the product.
[55:06.030 --> 55:07.870]  Of course, he's like, check this out.
[55:07.870 --> 55:10.870]  So I didn't I didn't have anything to use it on in my grows.
[55:11.030 --> 55:12.670]  I didn't have any mildew or anything like that.
[55:12.670 --> 55:14.790]  So when this dude was like, I got powdery mildew, I was like,
[55:14.790 --> 55:16.350]  this is what I've got to offer you.
[55:16.350 --> 55:19.590]  And something about the way that it coats the leaves,
[55:20.510 --> 55:24.110]  it causes it breaks the membrane of the powdery mildew,
[55:24.110 --> 55:27.230]  and it doesn't allow it to grow on your leaf is basically what I read.
[55:27.670 --> 55:31.110]  And when that shit hit the leaf, it just washed it right off.
[55:31.710 --> 55:33.390]  We did it with the lights off from the lights off.
[55:33.390 --> 55:35.910]  Just turn a normal lamp on.
[55:35.950 --> 55:37.950]  As you should with most pesticides, actually.
[55:37.950 --> 55:39.550]  Yeah, with any with any spray, you want the light.
[55:39.550 --> 55:42.310]  There are a few that you actually need the lights on.
[55:42.950 --> 55:45.590]  But sometimes you need to heat the room up.
[55:45.630 --> 55:47.190]  Yeah, yeah. That's what the deal is.
[55:47.190 --> 55:50.270]  Yeah, you actually need to heat the room to activate the oils in the plants.
[55:50.750 --> 55:53.750]  So while we sprayed it with the the the stylet oil
[55:54.230 --> 55:57.150]  and then let it sit overnight and then we went back the next morning
[55:57.150 --> 55:59.950]  and rinsed the stylet oil off with just clean water.
[56:00.070 --> 56:02.790]  Also very important. Yes. For most pesticides.
[56:02.790 --> 56:04.870]  Yes. You want to unclog the plants.
[56:04.870 --> 56:06.150]  They want to be able to breathe.
[56:06.150 --> 56:07.750]  So go and rinse that shit off.
[56:07.750 --> 56:09.830]  And then do those plants just came out of it.
[56:09.830 --> 56:11.390]  And they're amazing. Nice.
[56:11.390 --> 56:12.870]  Yeah. He got to harvest his crop.
[56:12.870 --> 56:14.230]  This was several weeks ago.
[56:14.230 --> 56:15.830]  He got to harvest his crop. I looked at it.
[56:15.830 --> 56:16.710]  I helped him trim some of it.
[56:16.710 --> 56:18.030]  I showed him how to trim it.
[56:18.030 --> 56:19.630]  No signs of powdery mildew.
[56:19.630 --> 56:21.950]  Gorgeous crop smelled pretty good.
[56:21.950 --> 56:23.510]  I haven't smoked any of it,
[56:23.510 --> 56:27.150]  so I don't know if it tastes like stylet oil, but he's an older cat.
[56:27.150 --> 56:30.510]  He's been he's like your dad, you know, just needs a bunch of herb to smoke
[56:30.510 --> 56:31.550]  so he doesn't get hurt.
[56:31.550 --> 56:33.510]  What is stylet oil?
[56:33.510 --> 56:36.870]  I think that's a hybrid. It's you know, I don't have it in this room.
[56:36.870 --> 56:38.750]  I should have had it handy before I brought it up,
[56:38.750 --> 56:40.030]  but I wasn't prepared for that.
[56:40.030 --> 56:41.430]  So fail on my part.
[56:41.430 --> 56:42.910]  It's just a white oil.
[56:42.910 --> 56:45.110]  Yeah, I did some research on it once.
[56:45.110 --> 56:47.350]  And I said white. It's not it's not colored white.
[56:47.350 --> 56:48.830]  It's just considered a white oil.
[56:48.830 --> 56:50.750]  It's not thick and white or anything. Nice.
[56:50.750 --> 56:53.990]  Yeah. When I heard about it, it was kind of pre Amazon times.
[56:54.710 --> 56:56.750]  I just couldn't get my hands on it. Yeah.
[56:56.750 --> 56:58.990]  Yeah. Yeah. It's it's available now and it's cheap.
[56:58.990 --> 57:00.150]  It's actually quite affordable.
[57:00.190 --> 57:02.390]  So it's a preventative as an outdoor.
[57:02.390 --> 57:05.030]  If you need to rescue something, it's something you can look into.
[57:05.030 --> 57:09.390]  And green cure, if you hit it just right, will will take care of a light
[57:09.390 --> 57:12.830]  infestation, but it's kind of touchy, too.
[57:13.150 --> 57:15.910]  Right. It's anything when you're in the flowering phase
[57:15.910 --> 57:19.390]  and applying a foliar spray of any type is a touchy situation.
[57:19.430 --> 57:24.390]  Deleafing, just removing the leaf out of and taking it out of the area,
[57:24.910 --> 57:26.670]  washing your hands.
[57:26.670 --> 57:28.830]  Don't touch them when they're when it's wet.
[57:28.870 --> 57:32.750]  That's actually I've been told it spreads easier at that point.
[57:32.790 --> 57:36.430]  So, OK, that's something I've been told.
[57:36.470 --> 57:38.990]  So. I would believe it.
[57:38.990 --> 57:43.150]  I haven't been able to put that to work too much, but yeah,
[57:44.110 --> 57:45.430]  I haven't had a need to.
[57:45.430 --> 57:47.310]  And if you've got powdery mildew in your grow room,
[57:47.310 --> 57:49.350]  you've got something to correct in the room.
[57:49.350 --> 57:50.470]  You've got some work to do.
[57:50.470 --> 57:52.190]  It's going to take you a little bit to fix that.
[57:52.190 --> 57:53.990]  You cannot spray away that problem.
[57:53.990 --> 57:55.830]  Yeah, it is an environmental problem.
[57:55.830 --> 57:56.430]  You got to clean it.
[57:56.430 --> 57:59.790]  You got to start getting fresh air out of the or fresh air into the room,
[57:59.790 --> 58:01.950]  stale air out of the room, lower the humidity.
[58:02.710 --> 58:04.790]  So if you get it also don't feel bad.
[58:04.830 --> 58:06.510]  I mean, it can even happen outdoors.
[58:06.510 --> 58:07.710]  Oh, that shit happens. Yeah.
[58:07.710 --> 58:10.030]  Yeah. I've talked about having it in a grow room.
[58:10.030 --> 58:12.110]  It happened the first time I moved into a new house.
[58:12.350 --> 58:13.990]  It was August when I moved in.
[58:13.990 --> 58:15.110]  So it was warm.
[58:15.110 --> 58:17.630]  And then that first winter crop I got powdery mildew
[58:18.550 --> 58:21.390]  in the back corner of the room because it was the concrete basement wall.
[58:21.950 --> 58:24.390]  Drastic climate change or season changes.
[58:24.670 --> 58:26.110]  Easier to run that room in the fall.
[58:26.110 --> 58:28.110]  Probably wasn't prepared for that. Yeah. Yeah.
[58:28.110 --> 58:29.350]  Powdery mildew. Boom.
[58:29.350 --> 58:30.350]  So, yeah, it happens.
[58:30.350 --> 58:32.590]  I'm a damn master grower and I got powdery mildew.
[58:32.630 --> 58:34.030]  That was just five or six years ago.
[58:34.030 --> 58:36.190]  Don't I've been told that
[58:37.110 --> 58:40.790]  when I talk about the powdery mold and both of us
[58:40.790 --> 58:45.110]  have been told that we make people feel bad, so don't feel bad if it happens.
[58:45.150 --> 58:48.030]  Now, you guys person at the store told me that the other day.
[58:48.030 --> 58:51.550]  I know I post amazing pictures on Instagram, but it's because I just don't
[58:51.590 --> 58:54.270]  take pictures of my fails.
[58:54.270 --> 58:55.950]  You never take a picture of your poops, do you?
[58:55.950 --> 58:57.990]  You post the gold on Instagram.
[58:57.990 --> 58:58.750]  So don't worry, you guys.
[58:58.750 --> 59:01.910]  I will. I'll fuck something up and post a picture of it on Instagram just for fun.
[59:01.990 --> 59:03.790]  Nice. Just to show you that Rasta Jeff fucks up.
[59:03.790 --> 59:05.310]  I've had some fuck ups recently.
[59:05.310 --> 59:06.870]  So shit happens.
[59:06.870 --> 59:09.750]  Yeah. The next time I make a mistake, I'll get out the camera and I'll own that shit.
[59:09.750 --> 59:12.110]  I'll be like, look, this is my dumbness right here.
[59:12.110 --> 59:13.390]  Minds when I get lazy.
[59:13.390 --> 59:17.030]  I overflowed a reservoir the other day straight into the floor.
[59:17.990 --> 59:19.190]  It's only a couple of gallons of water.
[59:19.190 --> 59:21.390]  But still, when you hear that shit overflow,
[59:22.230 --> 59:23.990]  I was only a few feet away and had my back turned.
[59:23.990 --> 59:25.750]  It was just totally focused on what I was doing.
[59:25.750 --> 59:27.830]  And I heard I was like, oh, shit.
[59:29.190 --> 59:30.950]  You just sit there and you feel like a slow kid.
[59:30.950 --> 59:33.870]  You're like, I'm going to have to take the short bus to work tomorrow after this shit.
[59:35.310 --> 59:38.230]  I was with some people that in the early days
[59:38.230 --> 59:41.990]  we were filling resins and took off to lunch and went to the bar.
[59:42.030 --> 59:44.110]  Had a couple of beers.
[59:44.110 --> 59:51.350]  So came back two and a half hours later and the water was still running.
[59:52.270 --> 59:54.150]  Did you guys have to swim to the reservoir to turn the nozzle?
[59:54.150 --> 59:59.230]  Oh, it was luckily it was a big, like an old mechanic shop.
[59:59.270 --> 01:00:02.150]  Just a big steel building with a roll up door on one side.
[01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:04.150]  So this was still real early days.
[01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:09.590]  It was most definitely trap house worthy, but it was an early legal grow.
[01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:13.910]  It was fun. We just rolled up the door and it was a blast.
[01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.470]  Back then. Yeah.
[01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:18.550]  Back in the day, you could do all kinds of dumb shit that you can't do now.
[01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:19.510]  All kinds of smoke.
[01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:24.590]  You can't do smoke and the grow while you're like we had our grow
[01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:26.070]  and our dispensary was attached.
[01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:27.670]  They were one floor was the grow.
[01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.230]  One floor was the dispensary.
[01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:33.350]  And so I would be I'd have we had a camera, of course, with a monitor up there
[01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:35.590]  so I could just look at the monitor and hear the doorbell.
[01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:39.750]  So I'd be water and similar situation, smoking a fat joint, just water plants,
[01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:42.950]  living my life, got reggae on and then you hear the doorbell and just run downstairs.
[01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:44.350]  I wouldn't even put out the joint.
[01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:46.510]  It just sat on the counter.
[01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:47.750]  Sometimes you never know.
[01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:49.030]  Yeah, I got that building.
[01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:52.230]  I've seen barefoot and shirtless felons working in them.
[01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:53.950]  Oh yeah. Felons running them.
[01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:57.350]  Yeah. Originally, a lot of the signs used to be made on like cardboard
[01:00:57.350 --> 01:01:01.510]  with like little hippie drawings and colors like my girlfriend did it and shit
[01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:03.550]  because that's how it was done.
[01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:05.790]  There was nothing printed on a printer back in the day.
[01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:07.830]  There's no barcode on any weed product.
[01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:10.990]  It was all just grown in someone's basement or upstairs from the
[01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:15.110]  from the dispensary and then trimmed and then brought right immediately to the grow
[01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:17.510]  or to the dispensary, put in a jar and sold.
[01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:19.710]  And what do you mean we had some weed?
[01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:21.110]  It just turned into money.
[01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:25.430]  And despite all that, certain shops still just boom, had the fire.
[01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:28.990]  I used to be better.
[01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:31.270]  I think that I think it is.
[01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:33.750]  The dispensary grows. A lot of the grow was grown.
[01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:35.750]  Was like honest.
[01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:37.870]  I used to grow. I worked at Metamore dispensary.
[01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:39.270]  I was the manager.
[01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:40.390]  My friend Tom was the owner.
[01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:42.710]  I was the manager right underneath him.
[01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:45.150]  Tom handed me the keys one day and he's like, here, you got a dispensary.
[01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:47.470]  Have fun. They paid me very well.
[01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:51.670]  So I worked at this dispensary and I would grow cherry widow at home
[01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:56.550]  in my own home, and then I would take that cherry widow to the shop
[01:01:56.550 --> 01:02:00.430]  and sell it to the boss for a decent price, put it on the shelf.
[01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:03.270]  And that was the most fire we had in there that week.
[01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:07.030]  All right, podcast world, I want to thank you guys for joining Jesse and I

[01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:39.550]  anymore. All right.

[01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:49.820]  Yeah. Welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:53.260]  It's time for episode number ninety two of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:56.820]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.780]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:03.260]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.220]  or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:08.660]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:10.700]  I'm your host, the Komi Rasta Jeff.
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:12.140]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:15.580]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.700]  for letting me play their music on the show.
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:21.100]  Big thanks to Kat, Coop and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:22.620]  How are you guys doing?
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:23.820]  I hope everyone's having a great week.
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:25.820]  I hope everyone's having a good Monday or whatever day it is
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.660]  when you're listening to this.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:31.020]  I'm smoking on some dabs of some amnesia haze.
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.460]  I hope you are smoking something delicious right now
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:35.700]  because I've had a great couple of weeks.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.220]  I'm going to read a few news articles here today.
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:40.580]  But first, I want to ramble about a few things that I have gotten to do
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.700]  this past couple of weekends.
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:44.740]  This episode is going to come out way after this,
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:47.260]  but the movie Straight Outta Compton recently came out.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.980]  And a lot of you guys don't know that I actually grew up in Southern California.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:54.220]  I grew up at the intersection of Belfar Boulevard and Compton Boulevard.
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:58.380]  So I was blocks away from the actual city of Compton.
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:02.860]  NWA used to come do record signings and appearances
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.980]  at a record store about a block away from my house.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:09.820]  So when I was like 10 years old, I actually met Eazy-E
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.300]  and NWA and the whole NWA crew.
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.260]  I met Ice Cube. I met Snoop. I met MC Ren. I met Dr. Dre.
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:19.980]  There was another guy with them called himself DJ Speed.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.020]  Yellow was there.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.540]  There were a few more guys there.
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:27.700]  And I remember I was a little kid, but I do remember that their album was huge.
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.540]  I'd already had the Straight Outta Compton CD.
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:32.380]  I was singing Fuck the Police all day long.
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:34.460]  I was like 10 years old, walking around my neighborhood singing
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.580]  Fuck the Police and Dope Man.
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.340]  But when they showed up to the record store,
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:41.580]  I remember the management of the record store looking pissed off
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.940]  because they were stupid high.
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.420]  Everybody in NWA showed up for that record signing,
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.060]  smelling like they just smoked a blunt in Eazy-E's van.
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:53.580]  So seeing the movie Straight Outta Compton kind of was very reminiscent for me.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.700]  It took me back to my old neighborhood in my mind.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.980]  It took me back to those times.
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:59.380]  Brought me back to a lot of memories.
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:02.820]  It was really cool to see that the movie was freaking awesome.
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:03.660]  It was a great movie.
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.980]  I'll give that five golden pot leaves.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.300]  I would recommend the movie Straight Outta Compton to anybody.
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:13.540]  The guy that played the manager, Paul Giamatti, I think his name is.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:14.860]  He did a hell of a job.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.300]  All the actors did a great job.
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:20.020]  They actually used Ice Cube's son to play Cube.
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:21.340]  He did a great job.
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:23.300]  I think everybody was perfect.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:24.140]  Hell of a good movie.
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:25.660]  I would recommend you guys go see that.
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:27.180]  You've probably already seen it by now.
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:28.580]  If you haven't, go see it.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:34.180]  There's one really comedic line in the movie that made me laugh my ass off.
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:36.980]  That was one of my best parts, my favorite parts of the movie.
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:41.020]  That whole scene was actually one of my favorite parts of the movie.
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.740]  From the beginning of that scene until the joke that ends the scene,
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:46.140]  that was one of my favorite parts.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:51.100]  One thing I did notice, I don't remember which character it was,
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:54.100]  but the manager character, Paul Giamatti's character, the manager,
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:57.300]  he plays a guy named Jerry, and one of the rappers were having a
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.020]  private conversation over a meal.
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:03.180]  And they completely repeated a section of dialogue.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:04.500]  And it seemed weird to me.
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.260]  It felt like a bad editing job.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.900]  Being somebody that edits podcasts and shit, I felt that the repetition
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.700]  of that dialogue was kind of a waste of time.
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:15.660]  It felt like this to me, I'm going to kind of do what I felt like I saw on the show.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:19.980]  Like the manager said, so we can't continue like this because we're going to go broke.
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:22.140]  And the other guy replied, well, yeah, but this is how we fucking
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:23.220]  live because we're gangsters.
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.820]  And then the manager said, but we can't continue to live like this
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:26.900]  because we're going to go broke.
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:29.460]  And the other guy said, yeah, but that's how we live because we're fucking gangsters.
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:30.580]  And then the movie kept going.
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.900]  And I looked at my date and I was like, did they just repeat some shit?
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:34.820]  Cause it was really awkward.
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:35.900]  It didn't feel right in the movie.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.180]  But other than that, that was the only flaw I found.
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:41.940]  A great movie, the straight out of Compton movie gets five golden pot leaves.
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:45.220]  Let's move on to my next little chicken scratch on this paper.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:50.220]  Uh, let's see this Saturday or last Saturday it would be, uh, I was invited
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:55.020]  to the high plains comedy fest in Denver, Colorado, the high plains comedy fest
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:56.740]  is a comedy festival, of course.
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:56.980]  Right.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:57.620]  It's what it's called.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:01.180]  And they do the shows, uh, throughout different clubs
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:02.820]  in the Denver, Colorado area.
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:05.860]  So some of the performances were at, uh, the high dive.
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:08.220]  Uh, some of the performances were at mutiny.
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:11.100]  Um, some of the performances were at three Kings.
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.220]  And then later on at night, performers were headlining at places like the
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:16.100]  Paramount theater and comedy works.
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.860]  I was invited by my friend Baker.
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:19.540]  What's up Baker.
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:23.060]  I don't know if you listen to the podcast, but if you do big shout out much love.
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.660]  Uh, Baker is a good friend of mine.
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.700]  Linked up with the comedy world.
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:32.580]  And, uh, it is Baker's fault that I have gotten to smoke weed and hash
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.420]  with some of my favorite comedians.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:35.740]  You guys, I'm not going to name drop.
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:39.220]  I got to smoke hash and weed with a lot of my favorite comedians.
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.860]  People that you listen to people that have podcasts that
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:44.220]  we listen to their podcasts.
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:45.860]  I was kind of blown away.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:50.540]  I was standing on Broadway in Denver, just smoking joints and
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.900]  bowls with world-class comedians.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.580]  And they were all treating me like I was one of them.
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:57.220]  And it's mostly Baker's fault.
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:58.740]  And it was also cause I had the good weed.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.780]  So big shout out to my buddy Baker, big shout out to the
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:01.940]  high plains comedy festival.
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:03.620]  I had a wonderful freaking time.
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:06.980]  Also a big shout out to our friends at grassroots California.
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:09.940]  Unfortunately, the grassroots store had to close their doors.
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:13.260]  Uh, but they had a, an awesome sale.
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:15.460]  I was able to go in there and grab several grassroots
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:16.700]  ads for the price of two.
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:18.820]  So I'm styled out.
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:19.500]  All right.
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:22.500]  I think that's enough catching up and humble bragging about what I've gotten
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.300]  to do for the past couple of weekends.
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:27.820]  Of course, fish is coming up here on the next weekend.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:30.140]  So you guys will get to hear a lot about that.
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:33.500]  Let's go ahead and get into some of the news articles that
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.260]  I have pulled up for you guys.
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:40.540]  If you have been following the show, you will remember that recently, uh, there
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:43.460]  was a raid in California of a dispensary.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:47.220]  And when the police raided this dispensary, uh, first of all, they
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:50.940]  treated all of the people inside of the dispensary, like complete shit.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:54.580]  They were completely disrespectful to a woman in a wheelchair.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:59.380]  Uh, then they cleared out the dispensary and proceeded to destroy this dispensary,
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:04.540]  but they did not realize that they were on a hidden camera as they destroyed the
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.780]  dispensary, uh, they destroyed displays.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.380]  They destroyed the security systems.
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.060]  Uh, they just tore this place apart.
[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:10.980]  It was terrible.
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:14.220]  Uh, as they were doing this, they were caught on camera eating
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.260]  edibles from the dispensary.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:24.340]  So the lawyer for the dispensary found the tape, edited the tape and put it, uh,
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.460]  it was put up on YouTube.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:29.820]  It was all over the internet, but also they were trying to file a case against
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:34.100]  the law enforcement officials that were responsible for this raid and
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.460]  for the eating of the edibles.
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:42.500]  Once the video was introduced and a court case was presented, the Santa Ana
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:49.420]  police tried to stop this footage from being used in a raid because they were
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:54.100]  under the presumption of privacy since they had already taken down all of
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:55.940]  the cameras in this dispensary.
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:58.660]  So these cops came in and destroyed the dispensary.
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:01.700]  They were caught on hidden camera doing shit they should not have done.
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:04.980]  And then they tried to block the video from being used as
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:06.580]  evidence in a case against them.
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.380]  Well, now I'm reading on the Huffington post.
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:14.460]  This is an article by a guy named Matt Furner and the headline says, judge says
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:19.940]  video allegedly showing cops eating marijuana candy can be used as evidence.
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:23.700]  The sub headline is an internal investigation of three California police
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:27.700]  officers can use security camera footage from a dispensary raid.
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:29.460]  And I think that this is great news.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.020]  I'm going to go ahead and read the article.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:35.780]  It is from Los Angeles and it says an orange County superior court judge
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:39.060]  ruled Wednesday that a controversial surveillance video allegedly showing
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.660]  three police officers eating marijuana infused candy and mocking a disabled
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.380]  woman during a may dispensary raid.
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:48.860]  Can be used in an internal investigation by the Santa Ana police department,
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:52.900]  the unidentified officers and their union, the Santa Ana police officers
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:57.020]  association filed a temporary restraining order earlier this month to block the
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:00.580]  video from being used in an ongoing internal investigation for the officers
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:04.620]  conduct during the raid, the police argued their privacy was violated when
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:08.100]  surveillance cameras recorded them from inside sky high holistic medical
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:11.580]  marijuana dispensary after they thought they had disabled all of them.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:16.340]  Superior court judge Ronald Bauer rejected that notion on Wednesday, the
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:19.780]  orange County register first reported saying that the officers had no
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:23.380]  objectively reasonable expectation that their actions and words during
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.860]  the raid would not be observed.
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:30.900]  The officers should not expect privacy on their on duty performance of an
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:33.020]  official function at a marijuana dispensary.
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:33.700]  Bauer rolled.
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:37.340]  They have made no claim that their work required secrecy or that it would be
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.860]  impeded by public view.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.860]  Matthew Pappas, the dispensary's attorney said the ruling is a critical
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:46.420]  victory for holding police and public officials accountable for their actions.
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:50.500]  This ruling shows that the court had the courage to say no to a very powerful
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:54.020]  police officer union and stand up for the rights of people who had bad things
[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:54.700]  like this happened.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.180]  Pappas told the Huffington post.
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:00.020]  Pappas released edited footage of the may 27th raid in June.
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:03.900]  That was published by various local news outlets, the edited video, which can be
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:04.940]  seen on YouTube.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.140]  It's also here in this article.
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.300]  If you guys want to see it, go to the Huffington post.com.
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:10.900]  Uh, type in, let's see, where will you find it?
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:14.380]  Just type in a marijuana rate and I'm sure you will find this.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:16.700]  I need to find where I was now.
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:18.620]  Here we go.
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.780]  Um, the edited video, which can be seen, uh, shows officers busting down the
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:26.900]  door and ordering everyone on the ground at gunpoint, which, uh, that's
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:28.420]  where the whole comedy starts.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:32.140]  They're battering using a battering ram to pound in this door.
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:34.420]  And the funny part is that the business was open.
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:37.780]  All they had to do was turn the handle and pull and they could
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:38.820]  have gotten in very easily.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:42.180]  Instead they used a battering ram and pushed really hard instead
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.060]  of just gently pulling.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.780]  So it says the footage, according to Papa shows police unsuccessfully
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.620]  disabled at disabling the shop surveillance cameras, which go on to record the
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:54.860]  officers playing darts, eating something, which he argues is marijuana infused,
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:59.140]  infused food and making a joke about an amputee who uses a wheelchair.
[01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:01.500]  Did you punch that one legged old Bonita?
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.620]  One officer asks, I was about to kick her in her fucking nub.
[01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:06.660]  A female officer replies to laughter.
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:10.500]  Corey Glave, the attorney representing, representing the officers and their
[01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:14.260]  union argued that the video was edited to distort the officer's behavior.
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:17.900]  During the raid, he previously told the Huff post that at least one officer
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:21.860]  voluntary voluntarily took and passed a drug test, the results of which
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:24.540]  were, were provided to the SAPD.
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:27.100]  Papa's denied the video was doctored.
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:29.700]  Uh, the full video is more than 12 hours long.
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:33.220]  He said, so he released edited versions with subtitles to show that what
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:37.020]  officers were allegedly saying the entire video has been made available
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:41.220]  to the police department and that they have seen the full unaltered version.
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.300]  Oh, and that they have seen the full unaltered version.
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:47.820]  Papa said sky high holistic has filed a multimillion dollar lawsuit against
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:51.540]  the police department, alleging that the officers used excessive force during the
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:55.980]  raid, the dispensary is also seeking the return of its property seized during
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:59.820]  the raid, which includes marijuana, cannabis, infused edibles, and thousands
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:03.500]  of dollars in cash, a hearing regarding the return of the seized property
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.020]  is scheduled for Friday.
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:09.220]  Glave and the SAPD did not immediately respond to requests for comment
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:11.300]  following the judge's ruling.
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.540]  So it looks like the ruling has been made.
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:14.300]  Oh no.
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:17.580]  The ruling has been made that the video will be usable.
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:21.940]  Um, I will research the hearing regarding the return of the seized property.
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:23.340]  I'm going to make a note of that.
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:24.460]  Sorry.
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:27.180]  It takes me a minute to write legibly, but I'd rather take a break and write
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:28.260]  it so that I remember to do it.
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:29.020]  All right.
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:33.740]  So, uh, they will be able to use this video in court, which is a great thing
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:36.940]  because if you or I were arrested and there was a video of whatever we were
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:40.820]  doing, uh, that video would be used against us in court, everything we say
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:43.300]  and or do will be used against us in a court of law.
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:47.340]  And even if we think that we have some sort of assumption of privacy, they
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:49.020]  are not going to give us any privacy.
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:49.820]  This is America.
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:50.980]  Big brother is watching.
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:52.220]  You're on camera somewhere.
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:55.020]  So keep that in mind, you guys, but I'm just glad that they're going to use this
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:59.700]  video, uh, because I think it's fucked up that these cops can act like they're
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:04.980]  trying to do something just and useful for us and then just go in and be thugs.
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:06.020]  They were gangsters.
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:08.340]  They went in there and fucking stole and destroyed shit.
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:09.500]  They were vandals.
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.900]  Um, they need to be held accountable.
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:12.660]  That's my opinion.
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:15.060]  So I will keep you updated.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:17.980]  I'm going to do some research on what happened to the property.
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:19.340]  I hope they get their cannabis back.
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:20.660]  I hope they get their money back.
[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:21.900]  I hope they get their money back.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:23.420]  I hope they get their edibles back.
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:26.540]  I hope they make that cop pay for the edible that he bought and ate.
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.460]  And then I hope they also sue the fuck out of them for all the wages
[01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.260]  they've lost and the mental anguish.
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:36.580]  I hope this comes back to a bite, this police force in their asses.
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:37.560]  All right.
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:38.940]  I've got another article.
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:42.500]  This one comes from the beautiful city of Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.740]  You know, Facebook has been bustling about the city of
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:46.220]  Pueblo, Colorado and cannabis.
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:48.180]  I read a fact today.
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.620]  No, I can't say that it's a fact, but I've seen this in more than one place.
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:58.460]  I have seen in red that Pueblo, Colorado now produces the most legal cannabis.
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:00.700]  Anywhere of anywhere on the planet.
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:03.020]  We produce more legal cannabis than anywhere.
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:06.020]  We are now the new golden triangle here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:08.700]  I would believe that our rules are great.
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.380]  Things are affordable here.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:13.740]  The climate is perfect for growing cannabis and everybody
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:14.860]  is moving here to grow weed.
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.980]  Everybody is coming to Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:21.380]  From what I've seen on Facebook and on the internet here, Pueblo, Colorado
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:23.500]  has become the new Emerald triangle.
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:28.380]  We produce more cannabis than anywhere else in the world, or at least the country.
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:29.460]  I don't know about the whole world.
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:33.140]  All right.
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:36.220]  So this news article, I'm going to try that again because I stumbled.
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:40.060]  This news article comes from High Country News and the headline
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:41.980]  is the Silicon Valley of Marijuana.
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:45.580]  Local officials want Pueblo County, Colorado to be the best place to grow,
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:48.380]  but not everyone is high on the idea.
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:52.780]  Uh, this article is written by a guy named Joel Warner and I will read it for you.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:57.500]  Actually, this is great because it starts off with a picture of the spot dispensary.
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:01.780]  And a lady, uh, it says Tammy White age 52 shows her son and his friend, the
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:05.900]  product she bought at the spot 420 in Pueblo West, they drove from Florida
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:09.220]  for the week, so Tammy, who has chronic back pain from bone spurs
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.100]  could buy and smoke pot legally.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:12.740]  There are a lot of great pictures in this article.
[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:13.740]  I did not realize that.
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:15.940]  I'm going to scroll through the pictures right quick.
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.660]  If there are any more from Pueblo, I will share them with you.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:20.620]  Oh, where is that?
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:24.780]  A Pueblo resident who moved from Maryland to work in the industry smokes pot while
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:27.180]  overlooking the marijuana plants he grows in his backyard.
[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:29.300]  He was hired at a greenhouse five days later.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.780]  Uh, so there's a picture of some guys.
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.780]  Mediocre pot grow.
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:37.660]  Uh, and then there's guys growing some mediocre pot in his backyard
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:38.780]  and his backyard's a mess.
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:41.900]  But anyway, I'll keep looking through these pictures here.
[01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:44.340]  Oh, this guy's in Pueblo West.
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:46.740]  It says it put his full name.
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:50.100]  Bill Rader, age 60 carries his favorite marijuana plant outside to soak up the
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.900]  sun in Pueblo West campground, where he has been living for two months.
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:56.500]  Raider, a veteran from Missouri who smokes because he can't take pain
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.820]  pills is one among many people who have moved to Pueblo from out of state to
[01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.700]  take advantage of marijuana legalization.
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:05.220]  This dude's living in a mobile home and it just has pot plants sitting right
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:07.700]  outside the mobile home here and he lives in an RV park.
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:09.460]  That's kind of weird.
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:11.500]  Let's see.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.940]  Oh, there's the open vape rep.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:14.140]  I know that guy from the shop.
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:15.020]  Yeah.
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:21.660]  Uh, Rick Ortiz waters plants at Los Cienos and outdoor marijuana farm.
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:23.500]  And here's the dude just watering a bunch of clones.
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:25.020]  There's some great pictures in this article.
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:27.300]  Big, uh, big shout out to the photographer.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:30.820]  I recommend you guys reading this article.
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:31.620]  There we go.
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:34.900]  That's a great shop of my, or a great photo of my shop.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:39.180]  Uh, John Verna, age 25, the grower at the spot for 20 turns the lights on
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:42.620]  and a newly constructed grow showroom where marijuana will be cultivated.
[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:44.540]  Visitors will be able to tour the warehouse.
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:47.900]  Hey guys, if you go to high country news.com and you look at the article,
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:52.900]  the Silicon Valley of marijuana, there is an actual photograph of the shop
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:57.820]  where I work, the grow room in which I work, uh, one of my rooms, it is in
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:00.300]  this article, so I encourage you to go take a look, all right, I've
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:01.260]  been rambling for a long time.
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:02.260]  Let's get into this article.
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:03.860]  It goes like this.
[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.540]  Mark Morley looks out over 30 acres.
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:10.860]  He owns east of Pueblo, Colorado and imagines the future on his, on this
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:13.940]  blustery May afternoon, there's little more than mud and puddles here,
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:17.340]  bordered by highway and railroad tracks and flanked by farm buildings and rolling
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:21.620]  Hills, but by the end of September, if all goes well, he'll be looking at a
[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:27.060]  pungent green thicket as 14,400 marijuana plants reach their full eight foot height.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:31.260]  It's one of several major outdoor grows launching this summer in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:36.180]  Eventually Morley plans to expand into another 15,000 acres, investing
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:40.500]  in center pivot, irrigation, greenhouses, and processing facilities,
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.700]  able to handle 40,000 plants.
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:47.980]  Morley age 55 and dressed in jeans, flannel shirt, and a tiger's baseball
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:52.020]  cap is a major Colorado Springs real estate developer after a marijuana
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:53.580]  dispensary opened in one of his buildings.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.580]  He realized how lucrative the business could be.
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:58.340]  Why he wondered, am I not doing this myself?
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:02.860]  If he planted corn on his corn on his land, each acre would require approximately
[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:08.220]  2.2 acre feet of water per year and produce $768 in annual sales.
[01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:11.780]  According to Rachel Zan Canela, a Pueblo based Colorado division
[01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:13.260]  of water resources engineer.
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:19.340]  That same acre planted with marijuana would require roughly 2.65 feet of water,
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:21.580]  2.65 acre feet of water, excuse me.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:25.180]  And gross Morley $6 million.
[01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:29.100]  Welcome to the big business of rural Reed ever rural weed.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:29.420]  I'm sorry.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:30.100]  That's hard to read.
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:33.700]  Ever since the local steel industry collapsed in the 1980s, Pueblo
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:35.700]  County has been seeking an economic savior.
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.540]  Nearly a third of its population is on public assistance.
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:43.220]  And in 2000, the metropolitan area around its eponymous city had the
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.060]  highest unemployment rate in the state.
[01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:50.220]  When Colorado voters passed amendment 64 in 2012, paving the way for legalized
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:53.220]  marijuana, the County commissioner saw a chance for revival.
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:56.740]  They hired Brian Vicente, the Denver lawyer who helped write the ballot
[01:21:56.740 --> 01:22:00.660]  initiative to craft rules for growing and selling pot outside city limits.
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:05.540]  As a result, a result about 50 entities, including Morley are now licensed or
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:09.140]  conditionally approved to do so in the County, historically, the biggest
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:12.180]  opponent of marijuana reform has been the government that Vicente says.
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:13.980]  Here, the tables have turned.
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:17.420]  No one else in history has taken as comprehensive look at
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:19.340]  establishing marijuana business laws.
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:22.740]  Pueblo County's economy, he adds has gone through the roof.
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:24.580]  And you guys, this is my, my town.
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:24.940]  This isn't.
[01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:26.100]  This is where I live.
[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:28.500]  I've lived here since I was approximately 15 years old.
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:32.180]  I've left a few times I've been back, but I've been here for quite a while.
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:37.340]  I have seen this town go from just a small po town.
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:40.420]  It was a little podunk kick town when I moved here and then it turned into a
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:44.500]  city and then it got going and then we had some things happening and people
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.020]  were buying houses and moving in.
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:48.140]  And then at one point, everything stopped.
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:51.060]  It seemed like everything fell apart and everybody went poor here.
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:53.660]  Uh, myself included, I was struggling.
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:57.460]  I worked shit jobs to get myself through, you know, and then I grew
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:00.020]  weed on the side because it was the only way that I can make ends
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:01.540]  meet was to grow some cannabis.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:06.340]  Now that we've got this legal cannabis industry, uh, obviously
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.780]  I am doing great for myself.
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:09.100]  I have a legal job.
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.420]  I can go to work and pay taxes now.
[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:18.180]  Um, it really helps our whole economy because the people that were, I'm
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:22.380]  going to say 22 to about 35 around here.
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:24.220]  There wasn't a lot for us to do.
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:27.180]  We could either work at gas stations or we could work at a telemarketing
[01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:28.860]  place or we could work crap jobs.
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:32.900]  But with all of the cannabis industry that has boomed up myself and all
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:35.340]  of my friends are living very well.
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:37.020]  Most of us grow weed.
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:38.260]  Most of us trim weed.
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:39.740]  Most of us are bud tenders.
[01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:44.180]  Nine out of 10 of my friends are involved in the cannabis industry in some way.
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:47.460]  And none of us are hungry for anything anymore.
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:48.860]  We've all got everything we need.
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:50.980]  None of us have to be criminals anymore.
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:52.340]  We don't have to do anything shady.
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:53.580]  We don't have to watch our backs.
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:54.980]  We don't have to look over our shoulders.
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:57.380]  We go to work nine to five or whatever we do.
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.020]  We work eight hour, 10 hour days.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.820]  And then you come home from work and you don't have to worry about hustling.
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:03.380]  You don't have to worry about being a drug dealer.
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:05.500]  You don't have to worry about the stupid shit that comes along
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.180]  with any legal pot industry.
[01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:11.620]  I think it's a great way to revive an economy.
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:15.460]  Um, you get benefits and health insurance and pay taxes.
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:17.420]  I mean, you can't do that when you're growing weed in the
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:18.780]  basement and selling it illegally.
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:23.420]  You're not part of the cogs of the community that make a society
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:25.540]  work in the eye of that society.
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:28.060]  You are a black market drug dealer.
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:30.780]  Even though you spend all your money at all the restaurants and all the stores
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:34.420]  in town, people don't realize that now they don't freak out when I walk into
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.340]  Applebee's and buy dinner for me and all my friends or wherever we go, go to
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:38.900]  Qdoba and buy the whole crew dinner.
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:40.300]  They don't look at you like dirty drug dealer.
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:42.220]  They look at you like, oh, that man has a job.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:42.980]  That's kind of nice.
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:43.820]  It's a big difference.
[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:44.660]  Feels different.
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:45.300]  It feels better.
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:46.940]  I'm going to continue on with the article.
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:51.460]  It says, but the area's relationship with pot means remains ambivalent.
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:54.620]  This is after all a place where irate voters recalled their state
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:56.300]  Senator over new gun restrictions.
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:00.060]  Some worry that the County's latest growth industry is bringing social
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:03.740]  problems along with money and others doubt whether the bold experiment
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:05.300]  will reap the promised rewards.
[01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:10.180]  Up to the 1970s, Pueblo was known as PU town because of the steel mill says
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.860]  Paula McPheeters, co-founder of Pueblo for positive impact, which is a, which
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:16.020]  opposes the County's pot friendly laws.
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:19.140]  Now we're getting known for that again because of marijuana.
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:24.300]  Uh, that group shows up at all this, uh, let's see Pueblo for positive impact.
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:28.460]  They show up at all of the city council meetings and they try to fight down
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:31.780]  cannabis and the cannabis use, but honestly, guys, they don't do any research
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:33.380]  and they don't know what they're talking about.
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:37.380]  So if a few members that do support cannabis would show up, we could
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:38.780]  shut these guys up every week.
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:41.340]  Lately, Mike is the only one that goes to the meetings.
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:45.380]  So I'd like to ask you guys to come to city council meetings when they happen on
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:49.100]  Mondays and help us speak positively about cannabis.
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:54.100]  I'm a hypocrite because I can't make it to every meeting, but I do go and I do
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.580]  try to voice my opinion when I can.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:57.620]  Sorry, I'm burping.
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:58.060]  Excuse me.
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:25:58.980]  I'm going to continue with the article.
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:02.220]  It says the city of Pueblo is sometimes called the Pittsburgh of the west and
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:06.980]  like it's steel town sister city back East it's glory years lie in the past.
[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:07.940]  Call centers.
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:11.100]  One of the few active industries dot it's downtown area.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:15.220]  Pueblo County director of economic development, Chris Marcus and says that
[01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:18.780]  one of his predecessors used to drive potential business owners down the East
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:23.060]  sides, crumbling streets and past crack houses and say enthusiastically, look at
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:24.700]  these people don't work for anything.
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:28.340]  Hoping that the promise of achieve labor force would prove irresistible.
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:32.860]  Amendment 64 gave local governments the power to decide whether and how to permit
[01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:34.660]  recreational pot within their communities.
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:38.340]  The Pueblo city council, for example, banned recreational pot
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:40.140]  shops and grows within city limits.
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:44.180]  It reacted similarly when medical marijuana was legalized in 2000,
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:46.140]  placing a moratorium on dispensaries.
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:50.700]  The Colorado marijuana enforcement division's 2014 annual report says
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:54.660]  that 228 local jurisdictions have voted to prohibit medical and
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:56.340]  retail marijuana operations.
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:59.220]  Pueblo County, however, rolled out the welcome mat.
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:03.060]  Marijuana stores don't require a lot of space, a lot of space, but indoor
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:06.900]  grow operations can says Pueblo County commissioner, Terry Hart and Pueblo
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:09.180]  County got hit pretty hard on the recession.
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:12.500]  So we had a lot of empty commercial buildings throughout the county that
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.420]  realtors were trying desperately to fill.
[01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:18.220]  Like some other pot friendly communities, the County made marijuana
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:21.940]  businesses, a use by right in industrial and business districts, meaning they
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:25.620]  weren't subject to sometimes time consuming and arduous special reviews
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:27.340]  or approvals by local government.
[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:30.500]  But Pueblo County offered something beyond cheap real estate.
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:35.340]  Unlike Denver, it had an abundance of, of available agricultural land.
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:39.460]  So local officials made marijuana cultivation, a use by right here, right
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:44.300]  there to likely the first Colorado County to do so according to Vicente and Joan
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:49.260]  Armstrong, Pueblo's Pueblo County's planning director, the County had also
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:54.220]  issued pioneering rules that prohibit hemp grows with male plants from being
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:59.300]  located within five miles of existing marijuana grows this pre this prevents
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:02.660]  cross-pollination that can lower the marijuana plants, THC content while
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:08.140]  increasing THC and hemp, which can exceed 0.3% under state law.
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:09.700]  So that does make sense.
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:11.780]  Although they kind of worded this weirdly, you can tell they don't
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:15.900]  know what they're talking about, but the city also issued rules saying that you
[01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:20.340]  cannot grow hemp within five miles of a cannabis grow, which is a great thing
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:24.180]  because like they say here, it prevents cross-pollination, which we're not too
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:28.180]  worried about getting the cannabis into the hemp because we're not growing male
[01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:28.980]  plants outside.
[01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:32.180]  All of our growers are pro growers and we've gotten rid of the male.
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:35.220]  The only males you would find would be on the hemp farms and we don't need the
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:37.060]  hemp farms fucking up the cannabis plants.
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:38.780]  I'll continue with the article.
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:42.020]  It says even the Pueblo board of waterworks, the local utility that leases
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:45.740]  water for businesses and agricultural use is trying to accommodate the industry.
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:50.700]  Last year, when the Bureau of Reclamation explicitly prohibited the use of federal
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:55.580]  water for pot cultivation, water board employees calculated that they could
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:29:00.300]  lease up to 800 acre feet of raw water to marijuana cultivators without running
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:01.900]  a foul of the feds.
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:06.420]  This was completely new territory for us as resources manager, Alan Ward, who
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:10.940]  notes 92 acre feet of the so-called marijuana water was already under contract
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:12.020]  of as of this May.
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:15.780]  When amendment 64 was first passed, I didn't put much thought into how it was
[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:19.420]  going to affect my job, but for a few months, it seemed like it was nearly all
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.300]  I was focused on.
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:23.140]  The new rules are more than paying for themselves.
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:29.580]  In 2014, the county netted $1.8 million from licensing licensing fees for pot
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:33.620]  establishments and marijuana sales taxes covering the cost of its virtual
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:36.020]  marijuana department and boosting its general fund.
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:40.180]  Since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, most banks are still cagey
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:42.260]  about allowing pot businesses as customers.
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:45.980]  That means county staff have gotten used to pot owners, popping tens of thousands
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:47.700]  of dollars in cash on their desks.
[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:51.460]  Marcus and says charter buses filled with wall street investors have been touring
[01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:55.620]  local farmland and there's talk of branching Pueblo grown pot along the lines
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:59.500]  of Pueblo green chili, another celebrated local crop.
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:01.860]  You guys, the Pueblo green chili is famous shit here.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:03.580]  We have a chili festival in September.
[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.220]  Uh, come get your green chilies.
[01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:06.500]  You'll smell them for miles away.
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:11.340]  See some good bands playing, but, uh, they're trying to brand the Pueblo
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:14.660]  grown pot, which I've been growing Pueblo grown pot for several years.
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:17.380]  Uh, if that's a marketing tactic, I'm fucking on it.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:20.700]  Uh, real estate prices are rising to industrial properties have nearly
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:22.980]  doubled in price to $50 per square foot.
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:28.060]  Square foot just since June of 2014 says local realtor, Kendall Curtis.
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:31.580]  And now that the first outdoor grows and greenhouses are materializing,
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:35.300]  agricultural land prices have doubled up to $10,000 an acre.
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:39.580]  All in all the Southern Colorado growers association, the local marijuana trade
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:45.260]  orgs and organization claims the industry has provided 1,300 new jobs and contributed
[01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:48.220]  more than $120 million to the local economy.
[01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:50.900]  You guys, I can list 25 people.
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:56.060]  I know that have jobs because of this boom in cannabis and they all work at the spot.
[01:30:56.740 --> 01:31:00.300]  There's one shop that I can list 25 people that are employed
[01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:01.940]  because of this cannabis industry.
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:03.420]  And that is one shop.
[01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:06.980]  And I think there are 14 or 16 shops just in Pueblo West.
[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:10.380]  So that's a lot of people that are employed because of cannabis.
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:13.900]  The County is also hoping to attract marijuana testing labs and processing
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:17.900]  plants, but low could be the Silicon Valley of marijuana says Marcus in the
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:19.780]  County's economic development director.
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:24.580]  He'd prefer that he'd prefer that to becoming Napa Valley to a, let me try
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:25.220]  that line again.
[01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:27.900]  He'd prefer that to becoming a Napa Valley clone.
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:32.060]  The County wants to export its products, not host busloads of marijuana tourists.
[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:36.940]  Former growers association, president Tommy Jidone is a Pueblo native restaurant
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:41.860]  tour and rodeo organizer who hosts an annual country music festival East of the
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:42.220]  city.
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:45.460]  He opened a dispensary nearby, but he doesn't smoke pot.
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:46.860]  I'm 49 years old.
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:49.980]  He says, once they legalize it, I wasn't going to be like, woohoo.
[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:52.700]  I'm going to be a pothead, which that's not cool.
[01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:54.740]  You don't have to be a pothead just to consume cannabis.
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:58.580]  The fact that Pueblo County wants to keep a fairly low profile hasn't appeased the
[01:31:58.580 --> 01:31:59.700]  industry's critics though.
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.300]  Marijuana hearings are heated.
[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:04.220]  County commissioners have received threatening phone calls and growers worries
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:07.980]  that some zealot with a crop duster could devastate the outdoor harvest.
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:11.540]  Our commissioners rushed headlong into this without consulting the County
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:15.740]  residents, uh, complaints, Pueblo for positive impact, uh, Mcfeeders.
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:19.620]  I guess that's the head, uh, the head of that organization, uh, that allowed a
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:23.660]  glut of marijuana stores and indoor grows to spring up in the Pueblo in Pueblo west,
[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:26.260]  the unincorporated suburb where she lives.
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:26.660]  Yeah.
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:28.940]  Like I said, there are like 14 shops out there and you know what?
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:30.500]  None of them cause any problems.
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.460]  We have armed security guards.
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:34.540]  Uh, people pull into our parking lot.
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:36.020]  They walk into our store.
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.420]  They make a purchase just like they would at any other store.
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:40.140]  There's a sandwich shop right down the street.
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:43.380]  There's a saw and tool shop right down the street.
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:46.500]  The San Isabel electric is right across the street.
[01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:47.900]  People pull up in their car.
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:49.420]  They walk in and they do business.
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:52.220]  They walk back out to their car and they drive away.
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:54.260]  Nothing bad happens at our dispensary.
[01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:57.860]  If you try to do something stupid at our dispensary, our security guard will
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:32:59.540]  walk outside and tell you to leave.
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:03.220]  If I see you smoking on the premises of our dispensary, I will tell
[01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:04.340]  you to get the hell out of there.
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:05.020]  I'm rude about it.
[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:05.860]  I say, you can't smoke here.
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:06.660]  Get the fuck out of here.
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:07.420]  What are you trying to do?
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:09.060]  And you people just drive away.
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.980]  I've caught somebody smoking in the back while I was headed for my lunch break.
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:12.780]  They just drove away.
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:14.420]  We don't tolerate that shit.
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:15.940]  We don't want it.
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:16.820]  We are a business.
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:17.900]  We're not there to cause problems.
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:18.780]  We're there to make money.
[01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:23.180]  I don't see why people are so wrapped up and not having a dispensary around them.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:24.580]  I'll continue with the article.
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:27.420]  Uh, the growth has come at a steep social cost.
[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:30.660]  McPheeters and other critics say marijuana related crimes, including
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:35.060]  the 2014 armed robbery of a marijuana shop have increased according
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:36.060]  to under Sheriff J.R.
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:36.420]  Hall.
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:39.980]  Meanwhile, local affordable housing organizations and shelters have
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:42.900]  been flooded with families who traveled here, hoping to find jobs.
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:48.180]  In the first four months of 2015 alone, 306 households relocated to Pueblo
[01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:52.260]  because of marijuana says and Steddleman who directs a nonprofit housing
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:54.580]  assistance organization called Posada.
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:58.140]  It is not easy to get a good paying job in the pot industry.
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:00.940]  Steddleman says many people can't pass the background
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.940]  checks and other checks needed.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:07.580]  Um, so these people are saying that cannabis is causing problems because
[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:11.780]  there was a, a break-in an armed robbery of a marijuana shop.
[01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:13.780]  That's one incident.
[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:18.980]  And that shit happens at gas stations and liquor stores once a week around
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:20.500]  here, and nobody says shit about it.
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:23.740]  It happened to one dispensary and it's fucking headline news.
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:25.460]  I dismiss your one.
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:28.300]  There are so many days in a year and so many dispensaries
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:30.100]  that this one is going to happen.
[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:33.620]  That's just shit that you expect in society.
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:37.380]  And then they say these 306 households that relocated to Pueblo because of
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:40.060]  marijuana, uh, we didn't send you an invitation.
[01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:41.220]  We didn't ask them to come.
[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:42.700]  We didn't bring them here without a job.
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:43.700]  That is their fault.
[01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:44.900]  That's not cannabis's fault.
[01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:47.220]  They tried to move here without getting a job first.
[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:49.420]  They tried to move here without getting the proper paperwork
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:50.620]  to work in the industry.
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.580]  They moved here without knowing how to trim.
[01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:53.380]  They just showed up.
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:54.420]  That's not our fault.
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:55.580]  That's not cannabis's fault.
[01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:56.580]  That's poor planning.
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:58.020]  I'm going to continue with the article.
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:01.500]  It says, and the problems could have been, uh, and the problems could have
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:03.300]  repercussions far beyond Pueblo County.
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:06.820]  In February, a local couple filed a lawsuit, US district court claiming
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:09.660]  that the pot girl next door devalued their property.
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:13.020]  It's one of two lawsuits aimed at striking down Colorado system on the
[01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:17.580]  grounds that it conflicts with federal drug laws, even if the state laws stand.
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:21.220]  Pat Oglesby, a tax attorney who studies marijuana at the center for new
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:24.260]  revenue in North Carolina, isn't sure how much Pueblo's headstart in the
[01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:26.060]  reefer race will ultimately pay off.
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:31.540]  A 2015 report he coauthored concluded that roughly two, uh, 20,000 acres of
[01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:33.580]  pot would supply the entire us market.
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:35.180]  It sounds like they have a plan.
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:36.260]  They plant.
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:39.460]  It sounds like they have a plan to really have a huge amount of supply
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:42.500]  while other jurisdictions aren't licensing any growers.
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:45.940]  So you can see the County gaining a short-term advantage and having a huge
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:51.220]  market share says Oglesby, whether that is an advantage that can be kept over time.
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:52.220]  I don't know.
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:56.340]  Uh, so he's saying, let's see, where did he say that 20,000 acres of pot
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:58.540]  would supply the entire us market?
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:02.540]  I don't know how accurate that is you guys, because right now,
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:05.500]  um, there is no pot on the street.
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:09.260]  The street has ran out of weed because people don't want to go to dispensaries.
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:12.820]  And right now in my area, there is usually weed abundant.
[01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:15.300]  There's usually some dank ass herb on the streets.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:18.380]  If you want to sack a weed, it's not a problem to get an ounce or somewhere
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:21.100]  between 150 to 200 bucks for some fire.
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:24.820]  Right now, an ounce of weed is always 200 bucks.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:26.140]  If you can find a good ounce.
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:27.780]  So something's going on.
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:29.420]  They're smoking up all the weed.
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:33.140]  I don't know that 20,000 acres would supply the entire us market because
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:36.620]  there are medical patients that smoke a half ounce a day, they turn it into
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:40.020]  concentrates or edibles and they'll consume a half ounce a day.
[01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:42.420]  So this guy may be underestimating this.
[01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:47.260]  He's going by just numbers that have been gathered by polls.
[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:48.060]  Oh, excuse me.
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:48.540]  I'm burping.
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:52.820]  He's going by numbers that have been gathered by social scientists or whatever.
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:56.700]  And those numbers are probably not accurate because people aren't honest
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:58.820]  when people do polls and surveys.
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.340]  I'm going to keep reading you guys.
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:04.500]  It says in the meantime, the townie town, the tiny town of Boone population,
[01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:07.980]  339 in Eastern Pueblo County seems grateful for the boost.
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:12.020]  Entrepreneurs, Mark Morley and Jeff Aoti, a food plant developer originally
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:15.460]  from the East coast stop in Boone one afternoon for lunch after comparing
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:17.420]  notes on their developing grow operations.
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:22.700]  Aoti bought a nearby 500 acre ranch where he spent 6.6 million installing
[01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:26.340]  the first 16 cutting edge, large scale, large scale greenhouses
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:28.860]  that will require 150 employees.
[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:32.060]  He already has several boonies as he calls them on his crew.
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:36.300]  And he's paying some of them to fix up the town century old veterans of foreign
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:39.980]  wars building where Morley and Aoti dine on frozen pizzas and
[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:41.580]  Dos Equis beers at the bar.
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:44.500]  Yes, there is still a sign on the VFW wall.
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:48.420]  VFW wall declaring a zero tolerance policy for policy for drug use.
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:52.740]  The bartender, Edna Rivera doesn't flinch as the two pot Barons brainstorm
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:57.660]  about recruiting Israeli cannabis researchers as she rightly observes
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:59.340]  between serving up rounds of beers.
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:02.260]  If it makes money, I don't care.
[01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:04.780]  So you guys, this article is about my hometown.
[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:09.060]  It makes me kind of proud to see that we are the Silicon Valley of marijuana.
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.900]  I'm kind of proud to have been in this since the beginning.
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:15.060]  I was the manager and lead bud tender.
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:19.380]  Uh, at the very first and only dispensary to ever exist in
[01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:20.940]  the city of Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:23.660]  Right now, there are no dispensaries in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:25.180]  We had the only shop.
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:26.660]  We were shut down by the city.
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:29.900]  Uh, that makes me proud to see that we have bloomed to become
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:32.420]  this Silicon Valley of marijuana.
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:36.580]  In this article, there are three pictures that came from my dispensary.
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:39.140]  There's a picture of our building with our Bob Marley on it.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:42.020]  There's a picture of our bad-ass, one of our grow rooms with
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:43.180]  my buddy, John Verna in there.
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:43.700]  What's up, John?
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:44.540]  I hope you're listening, bro.
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:46.260]  And then I'm looking at a picture.
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:51.300]  We've got a map inside of the dispensary and it's a map that all of the visitors
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:55.140]  can put a pin in the state where they are from or the city where they're from.
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:58.540]  And they put a little picture of our map in there and it's getting filled up.
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:01.620]  You guys, somebody from every state has been to our dispensary.
[01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:03.060]  It looks like, Oh, what's this up here?
[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:04.460]  Maybe not up in Maine.

[01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:52.660]  Fuck the police.
[01:40:52.660 --> 01:46:20.420]  Come on.
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:21.500]  Yeah.
[01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:22.060]  Welcome back.
[01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:22.780]  Cannabis community.
[01:46:22.780 --> 01:46:25.900]  It's time for episode number 93 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:29.340]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:30.420]  That's right.
[01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:32.660]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a
[01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:36.020]  new smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even
[01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:39.140]  someone who's curious about the current state of cannabis, this, my
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:40.780]  friends is the podcast for you.
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:41.900]  I'm your host.
[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:43.060]  My friends call me Ross to Jeff.
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:44.980]  Thanks again for joining me as always.
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:46.220]  I need to send a huge thank you.
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:49.860]  My friends in the mystic roots band for letting me use their music on my show.
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:53.820]  Big thanks to Kat and the entire mystic roots crew.
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:55.780]  I hope everybody's having a great day.
[01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:57.460]  I'm coming to you on a Thursday evening.
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:59.140]  It is finally cooled down a little bit.
[01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:00.060]  It's almost nine o'clock.
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:02.420]  It's been hot as shit all day.
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:04.060]  It's been hard to cool down today.
[01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:05.740]  So I'm excited for a little bit of coolness.
[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:08.060]  I hope you're getting a little bit of sweet weather so that your
[01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:09.660]  grow room is not going crazy.
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:11.580]  These hot temps have everybody struggling.
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:12.980]  It's almost over you guys.
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:13.940]  The fall is coming.
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:15.220]  It will cool down.
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:16.660]  I'm looking forward to it.
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:19.420]  So while we don't have any sponsors this week, you guys, but
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:20.900]  we do have some good news.
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:22.860]  Let's just jump right into it.
[01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:27.020]  I hardly ever have like news that we want to celebrate on the podcast.
[01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:29.780]  And this is definitely some news worth celebrating.
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:31.860]  I just have to make my computer cooperate.
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:32.220]  Here we go.
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:34.260]  I'm getting to the news article that I want to read.
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:36.340]  Um, this is a great headline.
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:37.940]  This article comes from the cannabis.
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:41.980]  It is written by summer Ballantine and the headline says Jeff
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:46.180]  Mazzinski since to life for pot freed from Missouri prison.
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:46.500]  That's right.
[01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:50.500]  This dude spent 20 years in prison for cannabis and he
[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.100]  has been released from prison.
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:54.980]  Uh, this picture of him shows him with a big ass smile.
[01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:57.020]  Uh, the dude looks happy to be out of prison.
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:47:57.620]  Who wouldn't be?
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:47:59.380]  So I've got a huge article here.
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:02.060]  Let's just get right into it and make this podcast.
[01:48:02.180 --> 01:48:03.220]  Get down to business.
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:03.500]  Here we go.
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.740]  I'm looking for the article because my computer is pissing me off.
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:06.140]  Here we go.
[01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:06.420]  All right.
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:10.300]  It says Jeff Mazzinski since to life for pot freed from Missouri prison.
[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:12.620]  He says, I spent a third of my life in prison.
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:13.300]  It's a shame.
[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:17.820]  Uh, now a 62 after serving 20 years of a life sentence without parole for non
[01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:22.260]  violent marijuana related convict convictions, the article says from
[01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:26.140]  Jefferson city, Missouri, a man sentenced to life in prison without parole on a
[01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:30.740]  marijuana related charge was, was freed Tuesday from Missouri prison after being
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:34.100]  behind bars for two decades, a period in which the nation's attitudes
[01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:36.380]  toward pot have steadily softened.
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:40.540]  Family, friends, supporters, and reporters flocked to meet Jeff Mazzinski
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:44.100]  as he stepped out of the Jefferson city correctional center into a sunny morning,
[01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:48.180]  uh, wearing a pair of white tennis shoes and a shirt that read I'm Jeff and I'm
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:48.740]  free.
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:50.980]  I want to shirt that says I'm Jeff and I'm free.
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:53.060]  I mean, I'm Jeff and I'm free.
[01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:53.700]  Shit.
[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:54.660]  We'll keep going.
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:58.540]  It says, I, uh, he says I spent a third of my life in prison, said Mazzinski.
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:01.780]  Now 62, who was greeted by his infant great granddaughter.
[01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:02.700]  It's a shame.
[01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:07.220]  After a breakfast of steak and eggs with family, Mazzinski said he planned to spend
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:10.620]  his post prison life, seeking a job and advocating for the legalization of
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:11.180]  marijuana.
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:15.100]  He criticized sentencing for some drug related crimes as unfair and described
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:16.940]  his time behind bars as hell.
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:21.540]  Uh, his release followed years of lobbying by relatives, lawmakers, and
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:25.060]  others who argue that the sentence was too stiff and that marijuana should not
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:25.740]  be forbidden.
[01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:28.620]  Mazzinski was sentenced in 1996.
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:31.860]  The same year, California became the first state to legalize marijuana for
[01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:32.860]  medical purposes.
[01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:37.420]  Medical marijuana is now legal in 23 States and recreational marijuana has
[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:41.860]  been legalized in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington state, and Washington
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:42.420]  DC.
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:45.660]  The reason he's getting out is because the public clearly has changed.
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:47.980]  It's changed its opinion about marijuana.
[01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:52.620]  And it's just one of many ways in which that has been reflected in recent years,
[01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:54.540]  said Mazzinski's attorney, Dan Vietz.
[01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:59.100]  Such extreme cases should further feel changing perceptions of nonviolent drug
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:02.420]  crime, said Michelle Deitch, a senior lecturer at the Lyndon B.
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:05.820]  Johnson school of public affairs at the university of Austin at Texas.
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:07.300]  That's a long title.
[01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:07.700]  Geez.
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:09.260]  School, John Lyndon B.
[01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:12.060]  Johnson school of public affairs at the university of Austin, Texas.
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:14.380]  I'm glad I don't have to say that shit in my title every day.
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:15.660]  I say, hi, I'm Rasta Jeff.
[01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:16.620]  So much easier.
[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:19.700]  Uh, the article says these cases really become exhibit a and the
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:22.300]  need for sentencing reform said, uh, Deitch.
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:23.340]  I think that's how you said that.
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:26.420]  Uh, an attorney and expert in criminal justice policy.
[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:31.620]  Just last year, the heavily Republican Missouri legislature passed a law to
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:34.900]  allow certain people with epilepsy epilepsy to seek treatment with the
[01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:39.180]  marijuana extracting, uh, extract containing little of the chemical that
[01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:42.380]  causes marijuana users to feel high and larger amounts of a chemical
[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:44.700]  called canna, cannabidiol or CBD.
[01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:46.580]  The patients can include babies.
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:48.580]  Vietz said, uh, nobody saw that coming.
[01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:50.260]  He said, that's a pretty radical statement.
[01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:54.260]  Police said he conspired to sell six pounds of marijuana to a dealer
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:56.220]  connected with the Mexican drug cartels.
[01:50:56.540 --> 01:51:00.220]  At the time the life with no parole sentences was allowed under a Missouri
[01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:01.700]  law for repeat drug offenders.
[01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:06.340]  Mazzansky already had two drug convention convictions, one for possession and one
[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:11.460]  for sale of marijuana in 1984 and another for possessing possession in 1991.
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:15.540]  It was the only Missouri inmates serving such a sentence for a nonviolent
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:16.860]  marijuana related offense.
[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:20.900]  When democratic governor Jane Nixon agreed in May to commute his sentence.
[01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:24.740]  The commutation allowed Mazzansky to argue for his freedom before a
[01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:27.260]  parole board, which granted his request in August.
[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:31.620]  Nixon Nixon's actions are a reflection of political confidence in changing
[01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:36.220]  norms around marijuana use said Cecilia Klingel, a criminal justice policy
[01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:40.500]  expert at the university of Wisconsin law school, the governor cited Mazzansky
[01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:43.980]  his nonviolent record, noting that none of his offenses involved selling drugs
[01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:47.500]  to children, the law under which he was originally sentenced has since been
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:48.140]  changed.
[01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:53.340]  Other States are reevaluating punishment for drug possession crimes motivated
[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:58.300]  in large, uh, in large part by the high cost of imprisoning low level, nonviolent
[01:51:58.300 --> 01:51:58.820]  offenders.
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:03.260]  You guys imagine how much it costs to keep this dude in prison for 20 years.
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:06.620]  We could have sent people to, it costs more money to send people to prison for
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:10.180]  years than it does to send somebody to college is what I recently read.
[01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:12.340]  Uh, we probably could have sent three or four.
[01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:15.540]  He was in there for 20 years, probably could have sent five or 10, uh, people
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:18.900]  to college for the cost that it costs to house him and nothing came of it.
[01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:23.940]  Uh, maybe, maybe in the longterm, he will affect people being released.
[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:25.020]  Maybe he did some good.
[01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:25.980]  I think that's called a martyr.
[01:52:25.980 --> 01:52:26.620]  Is that what he was?
[01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:27.820]  Maybe he was a martyr.
[01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:31.340]  So maybe it was worth it for the movement, but not for him and not for, you know,
[01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:33.940]  but they could have fucking educated some people for this cost.
[01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:35.780]  I'm going to keep reading my article here.
[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:38.820]  It says in Connecticut, a new law will make possession of small amounts of hard
[01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:42.420]  drugs, including heroin, cocaine, and crack cocaine, a misdemeanor for a first
[01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:45.660]  time offense, rather than allowing for the current maximum seven year prison
[01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:50.020]  Nebraska and Alabama expect to save hundreds of millions of dollars by using
[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:53.260]  new laws to cut down on the number of offenders locked up for possessing
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:55.500]  small amounts of drugs in Missouri.
[01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:59.140]  Backers of two ballot initiatives to legalize pot have permission from the
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:02.740]  secretary of state to begin collecting signatures, to put the issue before
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:08.220]  voters in 2016, another petition proposes reducing sentences for nonviolent drug
[01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:11.220]  offenders who are serving time without opportunity for parole.
[01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:14.540]  The Zansky said he will not smoke marijuana now that he's free.
[01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:18.660]  He's on parole after all, but if it ever becomes legal on the state and federal
[01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:21.260]  level, the Zansky said, definitely.
[01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:22.780]  So big congratulations.
[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:23.420]  Welcome home.
[01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:25.180]  I think he's going to help out the movement.
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:28.060]  If they're releasing one guy, why aren't they going to start releasing
[01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:29.860]  all of the people who are in jail?
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:33.220]  Anybody that committed any nonviolent cannabis crime.
[01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:35.500]  I think they should all just start releasing them.
[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:37.780]  Just go unlock the cage and let those dudes out.
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:40.900]  And I'm a joint and a hundred bucks and send them on their way.
[01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:42.420]  All right.
[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:44.980]  That's my good news.
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:46.340]  That is my good news.
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:48.180]  I do have some other good news.
[01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:50.060]  This is article number two.
[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:51.860]  This one comes from the cannabis also.
[01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:55.660]  I have to give you a little catch up story behind this.
[01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:59.740]  Um, recently, uh, let me see if they tell you in this.
[01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:00.340]  Okay.
[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:03.820]  There was recently a bunch of marijuana products in Colorado that were taken off
[01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:08.940]  of the shelves because they were suspected of having been produced with cannabis.
[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:15.460]  That had been sprayed with pesticides that are banned from the marijuana
[01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:19.740]  production, uh, laws we have, what's called the marijuana enforcement division.
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:24.820]  And they have made laws in conjunction with the department of agriculture to
[01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:27.220]  regulate the sprays that can be put on these plants.
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:32.740]  So recently, um, on the first, a bunch of these edibles and products were
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:35.660]  taken off of shelves because they were suspected to have been made
[01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:37.220]  with contaminated cannabis.
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:42.260]  Um, I had that article planned to read to you when I opened up my computer
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:45.420]  today and went reading for news and seeing what was going on, the cannabis
[01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:49.460]  has posted this article and it says update Denver pot products,
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:52.500]  past pesticide test hold lifted.
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:55.140]  So I'm going to say that one more time, just to make it clear, uh,
[01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:57.580]  Denver pot products, past pesticide test.
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:54:59.020]  And the hold has been lifted.
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:04.140]  The sub headline says marijuana products from mountain high suckers and MMJ
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:08.700]  America showed no trace of an unapproved pesticide listed among their ingredients.
[01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:12.300]  Company owners said they were using old labeling.
[01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:13.300]  So here we go.
[01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:16.700]  Now this article is by David McGoya from the Denver post.
[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:19.300]  I found it on the cannabis and it goes like this.
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:22.940]  Denver health officials Wednesday lifted a day old order to hold hundreds of
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:27.060]  marijuana infused lozenges and raw marijuana from two businesses after lab
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:31.700]  tests showed no trace of unapproved pesticide listed among their ingredients.
[01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:35.260]  The owners of mountain high suckers and MMJ America each said they had been
[01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:38.860]  using old labels that included among their ingredients, a pesticide that
[01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:41.100]  today is not approved for marijuana use.
[01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:45.620]  The pesticide spinosad had not been barred for use when the labels were made.
[01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:49.780]  The owner said, it looks like this was just an unfortunate labeling issue,
[01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:55.060]  said Dan Roland, Denver spokesman for its office, uh, for its office of marijuana
[01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:56.500]  policy, sorry for my stumble there.
[01:55:56.860 --> 01:56:00.500]  A state law requires marijuana companies to list on their product labels, all
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:04.380]  pesticides, contaminants, and herbicides used in the production process.
[01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:08.220]  The city's enforcement action is the latest in a series of actions related to
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:12.140]  pesticides used on recreational and medical marijuana because the drug
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:13.860]  remains illegal under federal law.
[01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:17.820]  The U S environmental protection agency will not establish any allowable
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:19.500]  pesticide uses on marijuana.
[01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:24.220]  Technically no regulated pesticide can be legally used on marijuana, but state
[01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:28.420]  agriculture officials have said as long as it's used does not violate a pesticide
[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:30.020]  label warnings and restrictions.
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:34.100]  It can be used on Monday, Denver warned businesses that products.
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:38.780]  Listing of unapproved pesticides should be removed from shelves and destroyed
[01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:40.340]  or returned to the manufacturer.
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:45.260]  Inspectors ordered tests on the product holds Tuesday after spotting spinosad
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:49.220]  listed among other ingredients of mountain highs, lozenges, and raw marijuana
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.420]  at MMJ America shop on Arapahoe street.
[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:53.220]  Excuse me.
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:56.700]  The test did not detect spinosad city officials confirmed.
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:57:00.780]  Uh, mountain high had been using old labels from when it purchased marijuana
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:04.220]  trimming from a grower that had been using spinosad mountain high co-owner
[01:57:04.220 --> 01:57:08.820]  Chad dribble said that was before the state said it could not, he said back
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:10.460]  then it wasn't a problem dribble said.
[01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:13.620]  He just didn't look back on the labels.
[01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:14.540]  It was a mistake.
[01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:17.020]  It was on there, but the tests were clear undetected.
[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:22.340]  We've never had a black Mark before now said, uh, now he said news of the city's
[01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:24.740]  action brought calls from as far as Las Vegas.
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:28.380]  Not only did we test negative for all pesticides, we were told by the city
[01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:31.860]  that just crossing off the name because we're already had the bags printed was
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:32.420]  acceptable.
[01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:34.540]  MMJ owner Jake Salazar.
[01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:36.660]  Uh, that's what MMJ owner Jake Salazar said.
[01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:39.540]  Officials later told him he needs to reprint the labels.
[01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:43.300]  We ordered preprinted bags, 70,000 units.
[01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:46.820]  Every time last time we ordered them, this wasn't a banned substance.
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:51.100]  We now have to throw all of those bags away and reorder 70,000 more without that
[01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:53.220]  ingredient, which we clearly don't use.
[01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:57.420]  Salazar said the state's list of pesticides approved for use on marijuana
[01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:00.140]  has been in the drafting stage for about 18 months.
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:03.700]  The state will not say the pesticides are safe for use on marijuana.
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:08.060]  Only that their use does not violate label restrictions on how they should be
[01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:08.540]  used.
[01:58:09.620 --> 01:58:13.140]  Some pesticides are so non-toxic that the EPA does not require them to be
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:15.140]  registered nor restrict their use.
[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:19.100]  Those can be used on marijuana, but the industry has complained that they aren't
[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:22.780]  potent enough to eradicate the kinds of pests and mildews that can decimate a
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:25.060]  crop potentially worth millions of dollars.
[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:31.340]  Uh, the city in the spring held more than 100,000 marijuana plants at 11 grow
[01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:35.780]  operations over concerns that unapproved pesticides had been used on them.
[01:58:36.140 --> 01:58:41.580]  So this article was from David Magoya and those products did not test for
[01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:42.180]  Spinosad.
[01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:43.380]  They were using old labels.
[01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:48.540]  Now this really sparks a little bit of question in my mind because I advocate
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:49.140]  Spinosad.
[01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:50.180]  I like Spinosad.
[01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:52.660]  I've used Spinosad recently.
[01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:56.700]  So this has me thinking, I need to go in here and go to the department of
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:59:00.980]  agriculture website and figure out why, or whichever website it is, it may be the
[01:59:00.980 --> 01:59:01.500]  MED.
[01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:05.420]  I need to go and figure out why I'm not allowed to use Spinosad because I run a
[01:59:05.420 --> 01:59:05.820]  shop.
[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:07.100]  I run a grow at a shop.
[01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:10.540]  Uh, I need to find this list of pesticides.
[01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:12.780]  I'm not quite sure where I find this list of pesticides.
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:15.860]  I'm sure that the operations manager at the dispensary has it.
[01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:17.260]  So I asked him for that list.
[01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:19.220]  We're not at that point yet, so I don't need to know that.
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:24.020]  But I'm sure the marijuana enforcement division webpage has a list of approved
[01:59:24.020 --> 01:59:25.500]  or unapproved pesticides.
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:26.660]  All we got to do is go there and look.
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:30.580]  I really want to know why Spinosad has been banned because I use that quite,
[01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:31.460]  quite often.
[01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:36.860]  Um, I will definitely figure out why, because something that will help prevent
[01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:44.860]  this, um, every dispensary will now be required to train all plant handlers in
[01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:46.100]  pesticide management.
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:51.060]  Everybody, every dispensary needs on staff, one person that can train every new
[01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:55.220]  employee on pesticide safety and to be able to train them, you have to be
[01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:57.900]  certified by the department of agriculture.
[01:59:57.900 --> 01:59:59.860]  You have to take an applicator safety test.
[02:00:00.380 --> 02:00:04.580]  And, um, I have been required to do that since I am the lead grower at this spot
[02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:05.140]  dispensary.
[02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:08.420]  So I will be taking, I will be studying and taking that test.
[02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:12.220]  And then I will know a lot of stuff about pesticides and we will find out why
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:14.300]  Spinosad is unacceptable.
[02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:17.420]  Um, the department of agriculture representative actually told me the
[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:21.900]  reason that Eagle 20 is not allowed in commercial grows drum roll, please.
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:25.220]  Because when it burns, it turns into cyanide.
[02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:28.420]  That's what the guy from the department of agriculture told me.
[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:32.420]  It had nothing to do with the danger and toxicity of the chemical.
[02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:36.620]  It was actually because when it turns, if there's a fire, it turns into cyanide
[02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:38.580]  and the fire department doesn't want to deal with that.
[02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:40.820]  I found that rather interesting.
[02:00:41.580 --> 02:00:43.740]  All right, you guys, I have got one more news article.
[02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:46.980]  This one is from local news here.
[02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:49.660]  This one comes from the beautiful city of Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:54.580]  I talked a little bit about Pueblo last time on the last episode, uh, talking
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:58.380]  about how Colorado and Pueblo in general was booming with cannabis and Pueblo,
[02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:02.020]  Colorado may become the, may already be the new Emerald triangle.
[02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:06.060]  So this article says funding college scholarships via pot grows
[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:07.900]  proposed in Southern Colorado.
[02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:11.460]  So the headline says, gosh, excuse my throat.
[02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:13.220]  I'm going to take a drink before we even get into this.
[02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:15.860]  I'm going to take a drink and then I'm going to take a dab.
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:23.160]  All right.
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:23.760]  That was a good drink.
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.920]  Excuse the throat clearing on the podcast.
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:27.360]  I probably won't even edit that.
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:28.080]  So I'm sorry.
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:31.400]  So far, there's no editing to be done in this show and I like it.
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:32.440]  I'm getting a dab ready.
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:33.800]  You guys, I'm getting ready.
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:38.040]  Some amnesia haze from our friends at Colorado's best dabs.
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.880]  I'm about to take a fat chunky dab.
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:41.320]  I'm getting it going.
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:43.360]  I hope you guys are going to take a dab with me on the podcast.
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:46.400]  If you're listening to the show, get a dab ready, get a bowl ready.
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:48.840]  If you're at work or something, sneak your bait pen out.
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:49.840]  Let's do it.
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:53.680]  You guys, let's get stoned together on the count of six, four, five, six.
[02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:04.930]  That's how we do it.
[02:02:06.090 --> 02:02:08.210]  We take dabs in the middle of the podcast.
[02:02:09.090 --> 02:02:10.890]  We used to smoke so much more hash on this show.
[02:02:11.250 --> 02:02:13.570]  I've been trying to get a little tighter and not be dad to fuck out.
[02:02:14.250 --> 02:02:15.730]  It also helps my throat last longer.
[02:02:17.010 --> 02:02:17.410]  All right.
[02:02:18.650 --> 02:02:19.850]  So, uh, yeah, that's amnesia.
[02:02:19.850 --> 02:02:22.650]  Hey, it's from Colorado's best dads and it makes my head fucking spin.
[02:02:22.690 --> 02:02:23.290]  It's so great.
[02:02:23.290 --> 02:02:24.130]  It gets me amped up.
[02:02:24.250 --> 02:02:25.170]  It makes me lively.
[02:02:26.250 --> 02:02:29.490]  Uh, hypothetically, if I were going to come home on my lunch break and smoke a
[02:02:29.490 --> 02:02:32.490]  bunch of dabs and need to go back to work, all energized and in the zone,
[02:02:32.770 --> 02:02:36.090]  hypothetically, I would take four dabs of that and I'd be in the fucking
[02:02:36.090 --> 02:02:37.250]  zone when I went back to work.
[02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:40.170]  All right.
[02:02:40.330 --> 02:02:43.290]  Before I get onto this next news article, I am going to mention that I am
[02:02:43.290 --> 02:02:45.490]  recording this podcast live on Periscope.
[02:02:45.490 --> 02:02:45.770]  What up?
[02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:46.890]  All my friends on Periscope.
[02:02:46.930 --> 02:02:47.730]  Thanks for watching.
[02:02:48.410 --> 02:02:52.530]  Uh, if you guys don't know what Periscope is, make sure you, uh, or don't make
[02:02:52.530 --> 02:02:56.930]  sure, but please I invite you to use your Android device or your iPhone device or
[02:02:56.930 --> 02:03:00.570]  your Apple device and download an app called Periscope and then look for me.
[02:03:00.570 --> 02:03:01.770]  I'm Rasta Jeff 420.
[02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:02.570]  I'm easy to find.
[02:03:03.370 --> 02:03:04.130]  Look for me on there.
[02:03:04.250 --> 02:03:04.810]  Follow me.
[02:03:05.210 --> 02:03:09.010]  And usually daily, I will do a dab on Periscope with my friends.
[02:03:09.290 --> 02:03:12.690]  You'll get a chance to ask me a question and I will rant for several minutes on
[02:03:12.690 --> 02:03:14.690]  your question if it gets my brain going.
[02:03:15.650 --> 02:03:16.690]  So check me out on Periscope.
[02:03:16.690 --> 02:03:19.850]  You guys, a big shout out to everybody that's watching on Periscope right now.
[02:03:20.210 --> 02:03:21.250]  Uh, what up Nemo punk?
[02:03:21.250 --> 02:03:22.170]  What up El Diablo?
[02:03:22.410 --> 02:03:25.090]  I can't see who else is on there unless they send a comment or something, but
[02:03:25.090 --> 02:03:26.130]  what up to everybody that's on there?
[02:03:26.130 --> 02:03:26.930]  Thanks for joining me.
[02:03:27.410 --> 02:03:30.170]  I hope you will join me on my next Periscope video.
[02:03:30.450 --> 02:03:33.810]  Sometimes I randomly decide that I want to put the podcast on Periscope while I'm
[02:03:33.810 --> 02:03:36.610]  doing it, but right now it's kind of cool because I feel like I'm talking to somebody.
[02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:39.730]  There's somebody, just someone to look at instead of just staring into the computer
[02:03:39.730 --> 02:03:41.730]  over here, I'm looking at my Periscope friends.
[02:03:41.770 --> 02:03:44.130]  I can't see them, but it feels like they're there.
[02:03:45.010 --> 02:03:45.330]  All right.
[02:03:45.330 --> 02:03:47.010]  I've got another news article up on the screen.
[02:03:47.010 --> 02:03:50.850]  I took a dab and got all fucking ADD and sidetracked, but shout out to dabs.
[02:03:51.810 --> 02:03:52.970]  Let's read this article.
[02:03:53.410 --> 02:03:54.410]  I read the headline, right?
[02:03:54.650 --> 02:03:57.690]  Uh, funding, color funding, college scholarships via pot grows
[02:03:57.690 --> 02:03:59.170]  proposed in Southern Colorado.
[02:03:59.610 --> 02:04:03.130]  Uh, the sub headline says Pueblo County commissioner Sal Pace says he hopes the
[02:04:03.130 --> 02:04:08.010]  measure that would institute a 5% excise tax on wholesale marijuana transfers
[02:04:08.010 --> 02:04:10.530]  will give Pueblo kids a boost.
[02:04:11.170 --> 02:04:12.770]  I am going to read this article.
[02:04:13.130 --> 02:04:19.050]  Um, I'm, I have mixed opinions on this right now, but it's by Jesse Paul.
[02:04:19.050 --> 02:04:19.970]  It's from the Denver post.
[02:04:19.970 --> 02:04:23.010]  I of course found it on our favorite news website, the cannabis.
[02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:24.970]  You guys, I don't bring you all of the news.
[02:04:24.970 --> 02:04:25.810]  I select a few.
[02:04:25.810 --> 02:04:28.010]  I pick and choose what I think is best for the audience.
[02:04:28.130 --> 02:04:32.130]  If you don't get enough news from me, I can definitely recommend the cannabis.
[02:04:32.490 --> 02:04:34.010]  Uh, high quality cannabis news.
[02:04:34.290 --> 02:04:37.210]  It's ran by a dude named Ricardo Baca, who is a really cool dude.
[02:04:37.250 --> 02:04:38.170]  I support that shit.
[02:04:38.170 --> 02:04:38.770]  Go check it out.
[02:04:38.770 --> 02:04:39.770]  If you don't get enough from me.
[02:04:40.810 --> 02:04:41.050]  All right.
[02:04:41.050 --> 02:04:42.250]  The article goes like this.
[02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:46.210]  If Pueblo County commissioner is proposing a ballot measure for a program to fund
[02:04:46.210 --> 02:04:49.770]  college scholarships through a marijuana excise tax commissioner, Sal
[02:04:49.810 --> 02:04:53.930]  pace says he hopes the new measure will give Pueblo kids a boost and help fight
[02:04:53.930 --> 02:04:54.570]  college debt.
[02:04:55.010 --> 02:04:57.850]  The County commission is set to vote at their Monday meeting on whether or not
[02:04:57.850 --> 02:05:00.810]  the proposal will be placed on November ballot elections.
[02:05:01.290 --> 02:05:04.410]  The excise tax would be levied when marijuana is transferred from
[02:05:04.410 --> 02:05:05.930]  cultivation to a store.
[02:05:06.370 --> 02:05:08.330]  Ace's office said in a news release Wednesday.
[02:05:08.810 --> 02:05:08.970]  Yeah.
[02:05:09.010 --> 02:05:10.090]  He said that Wednesday, sorry.
[02:05:10.090 --> 02:05:10.890]  I read that really weird.
[02:05:12.050 --> 02:05:16.250]  Pueblo County's perfect economic and weather conditions have created a boom
[02:05:16.370 --> 02:05:20.130]  of recreational cultivations without yet generating a tax on these grows.
[02:05:20.610 --> 02:05:25.250]  Beginning in 2017, graduating seniors from all high schools in Pueblo who attend a
[02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:29.770]  public college or university in Pueblo County will be eligible for scholarships
[02:05:29.770 --> 02:05:30.970]  from the proposed program.
[02:05:30.970 --> 02:05:34.970]  The release said every kid deserves an opportunity to succeed.
[02:05:35.370 --> 02:05:39.930]  A set in a statement, Pueblo County has potential new tax revenue from a marijuana
[02:05:39.930 --> 02:05:42.290]  industry that can benefit the kids of Pueblo.
[02:05:42.810 --> 02:05:46.690]  The ballot measure would propose a 5% excise tax on recreational marijuana
[02:05:46.690 --> 02:05:47.930]  grows from Pueblo County.
[02:05:48.330 --> 02:05:53.050]  It asks that on an annual basis, no less than 50% of tax revenue
[02:05:53.330 --> 02:05:55.210]  be designated for scholarships.
[02:05:56.050 --> 02:05:56.850]  50%.
[02:05:57.050 --> 02:06:00.050]  Well, if you're doing it for this, shouldn't a hundred, where's the other
[02:06:00.050 --> 02:06:02.730]  50 going, Sal, where's the other 50% going?
[02:06:03.130 --> 02:06:03.450]  Okay.
[02:06:03.690 --> 02:06:07.370]  Uh, the rest of the revenue would be used on community projects like Colorado
[02:06:07.490 --> 02:06:11.650]  state fairs, streetscape refurbishment, medical marijuana, academic research,
[02:06:11.690 --> 02:06:17.130]  and a feasibility study on the potential connection of Amtrak, uh, South Amtrak,
[02:06:17.130 --> 02:06:19.090]  Southwest chief to Pueblo.
[02:06:19.930 --> 02:06:22.130]  Now those all sound like feasible options.
[02:06:23.010 --> 02:06:24.610]  Those seem like they're worth some investment.
[02:06:24.930 --> 02:06:27.890]  The program may be expanded in future years, depending on revenue.
[02:06:27.890 --> 02:06:31.290]  The release said Tyler Henson, president, president of the Colorado
[02:06:31.290 --> 02:06:34.610]  cannabis chamber of commerce said he hopes the, uh, the County commission
[02:06:34.810 --> 02:06:38.010]  will fully examine the measure before sending it to the ballot.
[02:06:38.450 --> 02:06:41.570]  Under amendment 64, we gave local governments the permission to
[02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:43.050]  make these excise taxes.
[02:06:43.050 --> 02:06:47.290]  He said, I would just caution the County commissioners to look at how this will
[02:06:47.290 --> 02:06:50.530]  affect sales in Pueblo and the surrounding areas.
[02:06:50.810 --> 02:06:52.010]  That's the first thing I think of.
[02:06:52.170 --> 02:06:53.930]  They're going to add 5% more tax.
[02:06:54.250 --> 02:06:56.490]  The tax is already really high in Pueblo.
[02:06:56.690 --> 02:06:58.610]  It's approximately 25%.
[02:06:58.890 --> 02:07:01.450]  I don't know the exact percentage to tell you the truth, guys.
[02:07:01.690 --> 02:07:05.250]  If anybody on Periscope, maybe a Nemo punk, if you want to throw up the
[02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:07.730]  actual percentage of tax, I'll say that on the air.
[02:07:08.170 --> 02:07:09.090]  And I'll give you a shout out.
[02:07:09.090 --> 02:07:11.890]  Also make sure you guys follow my friend Nemo punk 15 on Twitter.
[02:07:12.250 --> 02:07:16.450]  Uh, he posts a lot of great cannabis shit, 17 and a half percent.
[02:07:17.250 --> 02:07:20.010]  Plus a 10% excise tax that already exists.
[02:07:20.010 --> 02:07:21.330]  So that's 27%.
[02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:25.330]  Plus they're going to add another five, which will make it 32% excise tax.
[02:07:25.570 --> 02:07:29.050]  So this extra excise tax is just going to end up falling on the customer in
[02:07:29.050 --> 02:07:33.770]  the end, no matter how it works, which is going to make cannabis tax 32% here
[02:07:33.770 --> 02:07:39.530]  in Pueblo, which means, uh, it's going to be roughly $185 for a quarter of
[02:07:39.530 --> 02:07:43.090]  cannabis, which is ridiculous when you can go to the street and you can get
[02:07:43.090 --> 02:07:48.210]  probably, you can get an ounce for that price on the street, you can get an ounce
[02:07:48.210 --> 02:07:52.170]  for $200, you can get an ounce for $150 on the street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:07:52.170 --> 02:07:55.530]  So this is going to turn around and put everybody back at the black market.
[02:07:56.170 --> 02:07:57.010]  They're just going to ruin it.
[02:07:57.490 --> 02:08:00.370]  They're trying to squeeze too much blood out of one turnip.
[02:08:00.370 --> 02:08:01.770]  I think is what my grandma used to say.
[02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:03.130]  Trying to squeeze blood out of a turnip.
[02:08:03.770 --> 02:08:05.730]  I think, I think that's what these guys are trying to do.
[02:08:05.730 --> 02:08:08.090]  And they're going to crash the whole marijuana thing.
[02:08:08.250 --> 02:08:10.210]  All right, you guys, I think that's enough podcast for this week.
[02:08:10.210 --> 02:08:11.090]  I'm going to wrap this up.
[02:08:11.330 --> 02:08:12.610]  I'm going to go see fish this weekend.
[02:08:12.610 --> 02:08:15.610]  So when I come back on Monday, I will have a lot of cool shit to talk about.
[02:08:15.850 --> 02:08:17.650]  I want to thank you guys for listening to another episode.
[02:08:17.650 --> 02:08:19.610]  I want to thank all my friends on Periscope for joining me.

[02:08:25.130 --> 02:08:27.450]  If you'd like to sponsor the podcast, send me an email.

[02:14:25.450 --> 02:14:26.290]  Welcome back everybody.
[02:14:26.290 --> 02:14:29.330]  It's time for episode number 94 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[02:14:29.610 --> 02:14:33.010]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.

[02:14:36.290 --> 02:14:39.770]  new smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even
[02:14:39.770 --> 02:14:42.850]  someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis, this,

[02:14:50.290 --> 02:14:52.650]  Shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band for letting
[02:14:52.650 --> 02:14:53.770]  me use their music on the show.
[02:14:53.810 --> 02:14:57.850]  Big thanks to Kat and the entire mystic roots crew.
[02:14:58.290 --> 02:14:59.010]  What's up everybody.
[02:14:59.050 --> 02:15:00.730]  I'm coming to you on a beautiful Thursday afternoon.
[02:15:00.730 --> 02:15:02.850]  I just got done working at the spot dispensary for the day.
[02:15:03.410 --> 02:15:04.450]  Uh, it's hot as shit today.
[02:15:04.450 --> 02:15:05.650]  It's about 90 degrees.
[02:15:06.010 --> 02:15:08.370]  Uh, we were in the spot testing out the air conditioners.
[02:15:08.770 --> 02:15:10.890]  Uh, we've done a little bit of construction and some rebuilding.
[02:15:10.930 --> 02:15:13.770]  So we were testing everything out today, putting in some work, putting in some
[02:15:13.770 --> 02:15:16.570]  hours, hope everyone's having a great day.
[02:15:16.690 --> 02:15:19.730]  Uh, if you are ever in Southern Colorado, if you're in the Pueblo, Colorado, or
[02:15:19.730 --> 02:15:23.770]  the Pueblo West area, please stop by the spot dispensary, uh, drop in.
[02:15:23.770 --> 02:15:26.170]  If you need some cannabis, if you need some hash, if you need some edibles,
[02:15:26.170 --> 02:15:28.650]  if you need some topicals, we would love to see you at the spot.
[02:15:28.650 --> 02:15:32.050]  If you listen to the podcast, drop in, tell them that you listen to the podcast.
[02:15:32.370 --> 02:15:36.930]  Uh, ask if I'm there, if I am there and I'm not busy, they may, uh, call me from
[02:15:36.930 --> 02:15:40.130]  the back and I may come out and shake your hand and say, hello, it'd be great to meet
[02:15:40.210 --> 02:15:40.410]  you.
[02:15:41.050 --> 02:15:43.250]  Uh, that just kind of depends on who's working and who's there.
[02:15:43.250 --> 02:15:46.010]  If they're able to do that, they'll come get me and I'll come say hi to you.
[02:15:46.010 --> 02:15:48.090]  I'd love to meet you anyway.
[02:15:48.570 --> 02:15:50.490]  Oh, I've got a bunch of great stuff to talk about today.
[02:15:50.490 --> 02:15:52.010]  You guys have got some news articles.
[02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:56.490]  I've got some stuff like that, but first I want to talk about my weekend, man.
[02:15:56.810 --> 02:15:58.170]  I got to see my favorite band.
[02:15:58.170 --> 02:16:00.530]  If you guys know me, you know that my favorite band is fish.
[02:16:00.570 --> 02:16:02.530]  I got to see two fish shows over the weekend.
[02:16:02.530 --> 02:16:06.250]  I saw Saturday and Sunday night at the, uh, Dick's sporting goods
[02:16:06.250 --> 02:16:07.810]  park in commerce city, Colorado.
[02:16:08.410 --> 02:16:13.410]  Um, Saturday was a pretty good show, but Sunday was a really spectacular show.
[02:16:13.410 --> 02:16:14.410]  They did some great songs.
[02:16:14.410 --> 02:16:16.370]  They did stuff they haven't played in several years.
[02:16:16.930 --> 02:16:18.530]  Uh, the band sounded great.
[02:16:18.530 --> 02:16:19.530]  The crowd was in a good mood.
[02:16:19.530 --> 02:16:20.650]  Everything was amazing.
[02:16:21.210 --> 02:16:24.050]  Uh, the only thing that kind of sucked and it didn't suck really, but my
[02:16:24.050 --> 02:16:27.530]  favorite song from fish, I think my favorite song is called punch you in the
[02:16:27.530 --> 02:16:31.890]  eye and the middle section of punch you in the eye is a jam that has been
[02:16:31.890 --> 02:16:35.370]  labeled the landlady, the landlady was written first punch you in the eye was
[02:16:35.370 --> 02:16:38.650]  written, uh, the landlady was dropped into the middle of punch you in the
[02:16:38.650 --> 02:16:43.290]  eyes, the groove portion, and it's always been played as one piece since then.
[02:16:43.890 --> 02:16:47.290]  But on Sunday night, they opened with the landlady, which is the
[02:16:47.290 --> 02:16:48.970]  middle section of my favorite song.
[02:16:48.970 --> 02:16:52.170]  So it was a little disappointing knowing that I wasn't going to hear my favorite
[02:16:52.170 --> 02:16:55.930]  song through the whole weekend, but it was okay because they made up for it by
[02:16:55.930 --> 02:16:59.050]  playing some, like I said, some old songs that I haven't heard in a long time and
[02:16:59.050 --> 02:17:01.210]  stuff that they have not played in several years.
[02:17:01.610 --> 02:17:04.450]  Uh, if anybody here's a fish fan, they played Harpoo.
[02:17:05.490 --> 02:17:06.610]  That means a lot to people.
[02:17:06.610 --> 02:17:08.890]  If you're a fish man, they don't play Harpoo very often.
[02:17:08.890 --> 02:17:11.090]  And when they do play Harpoo, it's a really great thing.
[02:17:11.090 --> 02:17:13.130]  So that's enough rambling about the fish concert.
[02:17:13.130 --> 02:17:14.850]  I had a great time, big shout out to fish.
[02:17:15.290 --> 02:17:16.330]  They put on a hell of a show.
[02:17:16.330 --> 02:17:17.610]  It was the end of the summer tour.
[02:17:17.970 --> 02:17:20.010]  Uh, they played a day in the life by the Beatles.
[02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:22.730]  Uh, they played a lot of, they played talking heads cover.
[02:17:22.730 --> 02:17:23.930]  They played after midnight.
[02:17:24.450 --> 02:17:25.530]  Uh, they played a lot of great shit.
[02:17:25.530 --> 02:17:26.370]  So big shout out to fish.
[02:17:26.370 --> 02:17:27.210]  I had a wonderful time.
[02:17:27.210 --> 02:17:28.970]  Shout out to everybody I met on the fish lot.
[02:17:28.970 --> 02:17:31.290]  I got to advertise the podcast to a couple of people.
[02:17:31.770 --> 02:17:32.970]  A big shout out to those folks.
[02:17:33.010 --> 02:17:35.490]  If you're listening now, also shout out to Danielle for
[02:17:35.490 --> 02:17:37.210]  being a great fishing companion.
[02:17:37.210 --> 02:17:38.050]  I had a great time with you.
[02:17:38.050 --> 02:17:39.050]  Thanks for coming with me.
[02:17:39.490 --> 02:17:41.450]  So that's enough ranting about fish.
[02:17:41.970 --> 02:17:44.450]  Um, you guys, we got a new comment on iTunes.
[02:17:44.450 --> 02:17:45.490]  There might be two new comments.
[02:17:45.490 --> 02:17:47.010]  I don't remember if I read this one or not.
[02:17:47.010 --> 02:17:49.530]  So I'm going to head to iTunes right quick and we will read this comment.
[02:17:49.970 --> 02:17:51.930]  And then I think we're going to get right into some news.
[02:17:51.930 --> 02:17:52.970]  So let's read these comments.
[02:17:53.490 --> 02:17:57.730]  Uh, this comment comes from Eden, 2013, and this was left August 27th.
[02:17:57.730 --> 02:18:00.450]  So there's a good chance I've read this, but, uh, I take a lot of dabs on the show.
[02:18:00.450 --> 02:18:02.290]  So there's a chance I did not read this.
[02:18:02.290 --> 02:18:02.810]  I don't remember.
[02:18:03.290 --> 02:18:06.930]  Uh, it says educated and entertained and they gave us five stars.
[02:18:07.290 --> 02:18:08.810]  It says, thank you for this podcast.
[02:18:08.810 --> 02:18:11.050]  I appreciate how organized and articulate you are.
[02:18:11.050 --> 02:18:11.930]  I've learned so much.
[02:18:12.210 --> 02:18:13.810]  I also love your hippie love attitude.
[02:18:13.850 --> 02:18:14.370]  Great show.
[02:18:14.370 --> 02:18:16.330]  I'm looking forward to the college level grow lessons.

[02:18:18.170 --> 02:18:18.730]  Peace.
[02:18:19.330 --> 02:18:22.610]  I think I read that because I remember reading the college grow lessons.
[02:18:22.610 --> 02:18:23.250]  I promised.
[02:18:23.770 --> 02:18:27.770]  Uh, those won't be on episode 100, but they will, uh, after episode 100, I do
[02:18:27.770 --> 02:18:31.050]  kind of plan on kicking up the education level on this podcast.
[02:18:31.050 --> 02:18:33.130]  I've gone kind of the intro level.
[02:18:33.130 --> 02:18:33.650]  You know what I mean?
[02:18:33.650 --> 02:18:35.290]  You've had your introductory courses from me.
[02:18:35.490 --> 02:18:38.290]  If you've been listening to all 90 something episodes, it's time
[02:18:38.290 --> 02:18:39.450]  for you to step up your game.
[02:18:39.450 --> 02:18:41.570]  And we're going to start learning a little bit more in-depth
[02:18:41.570 --> 02:18:43.370]  shit after episode 100.
[02:18:44.210 --> 02:18:44.450]  All right.
[02:18:44.450 --> 02:18:46.770]  So big shout out to our friend Eden, 2013.
[02:18:47.290 --> 02:18:50.050]  Uh, you left a sweet comment and you gave me five stars.
[02:18:50.050 --> 02:18:50.890]  I appreciate that.
[02:18:50.930 --> 02:18:51.650]  Thanks a lot.

[02:19:21.250 --> 02:19:21.690]  It's hard.
[02:19:21.690 --> 02:19:23.090]  It takes a lot of work and dedication.
[02:19:23.450 --> 02:19:24.490]  So I appreciate that.

[02:19:48.490 --> 02:19:48.770]  All right.
[02:19:48.770 --> 02:19:51.930]  I've got a few news articles I want to read, but a lot of you guys are out
[02:19:51.930 --> 02:19:53.410]  there smoking some cannabis right now.
[02:19:53.410 --> 02:19:54.770]  A lot of you are taking some dabs.
[02:19:54.810 --> 02:19:56.210]  A lot of you are hitting the vaporizer.
[02:19:56.610 --> 02:19:58.970]  A lot of you are maybe eating some edibles or whatever you're doing.
[02:19:59.450 --> 02:20:02.010]  Uh, what I want to do, I want to do a dab with everybody right now.
[02:20:02.130 --> 02:20:05.250]  And if you're not able to take a dab, if you're listening to this podcast in
[02:20:05.250 --> 02:20:09.410]  your cubicle or in the shop or in your car, and you're unable to take a fat
[02:20:09.410 --> 02:20:12.490]  dab right now, then this dab that I'm about to take is for you.
[02:20:12.890 --> 02:20:15.530]  If you're somewhere where you're able to take a dab, I want you to get a dab
[02:20:15.530 --> 02:20:16.970]  ready and I want you to dab with me.
[02:20:16.970 --> 02:20:17.930]  So start getting it ready.
[02:20:18.690 --> 02:20:20.410]  I've got the email, so I'm already hot.
[02:20:21.010 --> 02:20:22.210]  All I gotta do is get it ready.
[02:20:22.210 --> 02:20:23.370]  So right now I'm getting a dab ready.
[02:20:23.410 --> 02:20:24.410]  I got a nice chunky dab.
[02:20:24.410 --> 02:20:25.170]  What am I smoking here?
[02:20:25.170 --> 02:20:28.570]  I am smoking some candy cush, uh, some shatter.
[02:20:28.730 --> 02:20:30.610]  It's real nice and Ambery real clear.
[02:20:31.090 --> 02:20:32.130]  Uh, it's real, real shattery.
[02:20:32.450 --> 02:20:34.050]  So we're going to put some of this on the dabber here.
[02:20:34.050 --> 02:20:34.930]  I've almost got it ready.
[02:20:35.410 --> 02:20:35.730]  All right.
[02:20:35.730 --> 02:20:37.570]  Now I want you guys to start heating your nail.
[02:20:38.210 --> 02:20:40.210]  Usually takes somewhere between 10 and 20 seconds.
[02:20:40.970 --> 02:20:44.090]  So if you need more time, I'm gonna let you have it.
[02:20:44.570 --> 02:20:47.050]  I'm kind of trying to hesitate, but it's hard to hesitate on a podcast.
[02:20:47.050 --> 02:20:47.330]  All right.
[02:20:47.610 --> 02:20:48.490]  It's about dab time.
[02:20:48.490 --> 02:20:50.090]  You guys, I'm getting the rig up to my face.
[02:20:50.610 --> 02:20:50.850]  All right.
[02:20:51.290 --> 02:20:53.570]  I want everybody listening to take a dab with me right now.
[02:20:53.570 --> 02:20:54.850]  This would be a big group dab.
[02:20:54.850 --> 02:20:56.010]  And then we're going to read some news.
[02:20:56.050 --> 02:20:59.890]  And if you cannot take a dab, all of us that are dabbing are thinking about
[02:20:59.890 --> 02:21:04.530]  all of the people that are at work or wherever they are on the bus, uh, in a
[02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:07.290]  taxi, if you're in an Uber, you can probably smoke some weed.
[02:21:07.890 --> 02:21:10.330]  Most Uber drivers don't give a shit if you smoke out their Uber ride.
[02:21:10.330 --> 02:21:12.090]  So if you're in an Uber, you have no excuse.
[02:21:12.090 --> 02:21:13.570]  Get down on a bowl, get down on a dab.
[02:21:14.050 --> 02:21:14.810]  But here we go, guys.
[02:21:14.890 --> 02:21:15.850]  This is a group dab.
[02:21:15.930 --> 02:21:18.530]  Let's do this on the count of six, four, five, six.
[02:21:18.530 --> 02:21:18.890]  Here we go.
[02:21:18.890 --> 02:21:19.570]  Fat dabs.
[02:21:31.410 --> 02:21:32.690]  Yeah, that's what I like.
[02:21:33.050 --> 02:21:33.970]  That's what I like.
[02:21:35.690 --> 02:21:37.970]  Like about a half gram dab of some candy cush.
[02:21:38.330 --> 02:21:39.130]  And I don't cough.
[02:21:39.610 --> 02:21:43.370]  It's very rare when I cough from a dab and I've got to take like a serious dab or
[02:21:43.370 --> 02:21:46.290]  the water's got to be murky or something's got to go wrong if I'm going to cough from
[02:21:46.290 --> 02:21:48.810]  a dab, but that was a fat dab.
[02:21:48.810 --> 02:21:50.250]  I hope everybody got to take a dab with me.
[02:21:50.490 --> 02:21:52.450]  You guys, if you weren't able to take a dab, I hope you're feeling
[02:21:52.450 --> 02:21:53.370]  the dab that I just took.
[02:21:53.370 --> 02:21:54.330]  I hope you're feeling the love.
[02:21:54.330 --> 02:21:55.410]  I hope you're feeling the vibe.
[02:21:55.730 --> 02:21:57.890]  I really appreciate you guys for joining me for a dab.
[02:21:58.650 --> 02:21:59.010]  All right.
[02:21:59.010 --> 02:22:00.850]  I've been talking about some news articles and I've been
[02:22:00.850 --> 02:22:01.850]  rambling for a few minutes.
[02:22:01.850 --> 02:22:04.170]  So let's open up these news articles.
[02:22:04.810 --> 02:22:07.890]  And just to, uh, just for a disclaimer, I know that earlier in the future, in
[02:22:07.890 --> 02:22:10.610]  the past episode, I said that I was going to get more into grow lessons.
[02:22:10.890 --> 02:22:11.650]  I will do that.
[02:22:11.650 --> 02:22:12.610]  I have been doing that.
[02:22:12.650 --> 02:22:13.770]  I've got a lot of stuff coming up.
[02:22:13.770 --> 02:22:15.530]  I've got a CBD episode coming up.
[02:22:16.090 --> 02:22:18.850]  Uh, I've gotten a few episodes in the works that are partial episodes.
[02:22:18.850 --> 02:22:22.530]  I'm taking notes and getting shit ready, but there has been so much news that I
[02:22:22.530 --> 02:22:25.090]  feel it's my responsibility to bring this news to you.
[02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:28.210]  So here comes the first news article.
[02:22:28.770 --> 02:22:32.050]  I found this article on the cannabis and it was written by
[02:22:32.130 --> 02:22:33.650]  John Murray of the Denver post.
[02:22:33.850 --> 02:22:37.930]  The headline says Denver social pot use plans are getting overhauled.
[02:22:37.930 --> 02:22:40.410]  The sub headline says the idea isn't dead.
[02:22:40.450 --> 02:22:43.690]  Backers of the proposal say they will join talks with city and business
[02:22:43.690 --> 02:22:46.090]  leaders to try to work out a compromise.
[02:22:46.570 --> 02:22:48.010]  So the article goes like this.
[02:22:48.370 --> 02:22:52.290]  Activists behind a proposed Denver ballot initiative to allow some marijuana
[02:22:52.290 --> 02:22:55.210]  use in bars and other businesses say they will pull the measure.
[02:22:55.250 --> 02:22:59.050]  The Denver post has confirmed their new goal, crafting a compromise
[02:22:59.050 --> 02:23:01.450]  measure with city and business leaders.
[02:23:01.890 --> 02:23:05.130]  The verbal agreement with a group that includes city attorney, Scott Martinez
[02:23:05.130 --> 02:23:06.810]  averts a public vote in November.
[02:23:07.090 --> 02:23:10.730]  One that might've allowed more extensive pot consumption in publicly accessible
[02:23:10.730 --> 02:23:14.970]  places than city officials and some business leaders were comfortable with.
[02:23:15.610 --> 02:23:19.010]  Mason to vert of the marijuana policy project said fellow backers of the
[02:23:19.010 --> 02:23:21.090]  limited social cannabis use initiative.
[02:23:21.370 --> 02:23:24.370]  Plan to announce the withdrawal Thursday before Friday's expected
[02:23:24.370 --> 02:23:25.610]  certification of the measure.
[02:23:26.170 --> 02:23:30.450]  Uh, for the November 3rd ballot activists now will shift to working with city
[02:23:30.450 --> 02:23:33.770]  officials and the state restaurant and lodging associations to work out an
[02:23:33.770 --> 02:23:37.050]  ordinance that they hope will be considered by the Denver council or by the city
[02:23:37.050 --> 02:23:39.090]  council, excuse me, within the next year.
[02:23:39.730 --> 02:23:43.290]  The downtown Denver partnership, which represents business interests in
[02:23:43.290 --> 02:23:45.330]  that area also plans to take part.
[02:23:45.930 --> 02:23:48.730]  We're not approaching the withdrawal of this initiative lightly said to vert,
[02:23:48.730 --> 02:23:54.130]  who also was a coauthor of Colorado's marijuana legalizing amendment 64 in 2012.
[02:23:54.490 --> 02:23:58.330]  We believe that cannabis users derive deserve the freedom and, uh,
[02:23:58.410 --> 02:23:59.130]  let me try that again.
[02:23:59.810 --> 02:24:03.570]  We believe that cannabis users deserve the freedom to congregate and socialize
[02:24:03.570 --> 02:24:05.410]  to the same extent as alcohol users.
[02:24:05.690 --> 02:24:07.090]  And you guys, I'm going to interject here.
[02:24:07.130 --> 02:24:11.130]  When we set up this cannabis system that we have, the whole model that they
[02:24:11.130 --> 02:24:14.170]  modeled it after was to make it like alcohol.
[02:24:14.170 --> 02:24:16.290]  They wanted to regulate it like alcohol.
[02:24:16.530 --> 02:24:20.730]  And we're able to go to so many places and drink alcohol all night long.
[02:24:20.770 --> 02:24:23.970]  Why aren't there a few places for us to go and take some dabs and smoke some
[02:24:24.010 --> 02:24:25.850]  flowers and hang out with our friends?
[02:24:26.170 --> 02:24:28.610]  We don't always have to be at my house sitting at the dab table.
[02:24:28.610 --> 02:24:30.090]  We should be able to go somewhere else.
[02:24:30.650 --> 02:24:34.210]  There are so many stoners out there that I don't know because they're all at their
[02:24:34.210 --> 02:24:36.050]  house on their couch taking dabs.
[02:24:36.050 --> 02:24:38.690]  Cause they don't come to my house and sit on my couch and take dabs.
[02:24:38.890 --> 02:24:39.770]  So we're never going to meet.
[02:24:39.810 --> 02:24:42.170]  If we had a social club, we'd go meet each other.
[02:24:42.170 --> 02:24:45.130]  So that way, when somebody got tired of smoking, what am I smoking?
[02:24:45.130 --> 02:24:48.250]  If I got tired of smoking candy, cush, I could go trade them my candy cush for
[02:24:48.250 --> 02:24:49.690]  some of their OG cush or whatever.
[02:24:50.330 --> 02:24:52.610]  I'm just making a nice little community, a nice little network.
[02:24:53.090 --> 02:24:54.130]  I'm going to keep on with the article.
[02:24:54.130 --> 02:24:58.930]  It says they found ready support in the ballot petitioning process, turning in
[02:24:59.130 --> 02:25:02.650]  10,700 signatures, more than twice as many as needed.
[02:25:02.850 --> 02:25:05.690]  Although Denver police have shut down private cannabis clubs, the city's
[02:25:05.690 --> 02:25:09.850]  marijuana policy office this year began examining as an evolving regulatory
[02:25:09.850 --> 02:25:12.730]  need to the potential of allowing some social use of marijuana.
[02:25:13.250 --> 02:25:16.850]  The idea came up in council race, let races last spring with some successful
[02:25:16.850 --> 02:25:20.250]  candidates open to the idea in part, because tourists lack places to
[02:25:20.250 --> 02:25:21.810]  consume their purchases legally.
[02:25:22.450 --> 02:25:23.090]  That's very true.
[02:25:23.090 --> 02:25:24.370]  You guys, you can come to Colorado.
[02:25:24.370 --> 02:25:27.210]  And if you're not from here, if you've got an out of state license, you can
[02:25:27.210 --> 02:25:29.250]  purchase up to seven grams of cannabis.
[02:25:29.250 --> 02:25:31.210]  You can purchase up to seven grams of hash.
[02:25:31.490 --> 02:25:34.370]  You can purchase seven grams total in any combination of edibles,
[02:25:34.370 --> 02:25:36.290]  hash tinctures, and topicals.
[02:25:36.690 --> 02:25:39.090]  But what you can't do once you've made the purchase, there's
[02:25:39.090 --> 02:25:40.370]  nowhere to fucking smoke.
[02:25:40.610 --> 02:25:43.410]  You can't go to the hotel and smoke because they don't allow smoking.
[02:25:43.410 --> 02:25:45.450]  You can't go to the park because that's illegal.
[02:25:45.690 --> 02:25:46.930]  Unless you know somebody.
[02:25:47.450 --> 02:25:50.170]  You just have all this cannabis that you can't smoke and you're not allowed to
[02:25:50.170 --> 02:25:52.450]  take it to your home state to smoke it because it's illegal to
[02:25:52.450 --> 02:25:53.850]  travel across state lines with it.
[02:25:54.210 --> 02:25:58.090]  So I think that this smoking lounge type of an environment is something
[02:25:58.090 --> 02:25:59.290]  that we really, really need.
[02:25:59.650 --> 02:26:00.610]  I'll continue with the article.
[02:26:00.610 --> 02:26:04.170]  It says, but city efforts were in early stages when to vert and Brian
[02:26:04.170 --> 02:26:08.210]  Vicente of cannabis focus law firm, Vicente Centerberg, both frustrated
[02:26:08.210 --> 02:26:11.610]  with what they saw as an action began to push for the initiative.
[02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:15.770]  Uh, to vert and several people involved in the recent talks say it's
[02:26:15.770 --> 02:26:17.370]  too soon to predict what will result.
[02:26:17.730 --> 02:26:20.890]  Options could range from a narrow ordinance, the last private clubs to a
[02:26:20.890 --> 02:26:24.290]  more extensive law that would break new ground in Colorado by allowing patrons
[02:26:24.290 --> 02:26:28.530]  of some bars to vape inside or smoke outside as the initiative proposed.
[02:26:29.490 --> 02:26:33.050]  The initiative withdrawal ensures we now have the time and ability to
[02:26:33.050 --> 02:26:36.410]  include all interested stakeholders to reach consensus on this important
[02:26:36.410 --> 02:26:40.610]  issue said councilman Albus Brooks, who represents most of downtown.
[02:26:40.930 --> 02:26:44.290]  I'm committed to working on a broadly acceptable solution, but finding
[02:26:44.290 --> 02:26:47.570]  common ground for an expansion of the current law, which restricts consumption
[02:26:47.570 --> 02:26:50.250]  mostly to private residents might prove tricky.
[02:26:50.490 --> 02:26:54.330]  There's also the chance that a consensus proposal won't go far enough for the
[02:26:54.330 --> 02:26:59.330]  activists while mayor Michael Hancock's administration took no position on the
[02:26:59.330 --> 02:27:02.690]  proposed initiative, the city attorney's office questioned the legality of its
[02:27:02.690 --> 02:27:06.650]  scope, even state laws against public consumption that its lawyers viewed as
[02:27:06.650 --> 02:27:11.410]  conflicting and Sonia Riggs, president and CEO of the Colorado restaurant
[02:27:11.410 --> 02:27:15.690]  association expressed adamant opposition on behalf of about half of the state's
[02:27:15.690 --> 02:27:19.410]  restaurants in part based on concerns that insurers might drop coverage of all
[02:27:19.410 --> 02:27:21.450]  restaurants because of liability concerns.
[02:27:22.050 --> 02:27:26.130]  This week, the Colorado hotel and lodging association, Metro Denver lodging council
[02:27:26.130 --> 02:27:30.010]  and Colorado restaurant association said in a statement that they appreciated the
[02:27:30.010 --> 02:27:32.050]  activist withdrawal of the initiative.
[02:27:32.450 --> 02:27:36.170]  Our respective industries are committed to working with the promote the proponents
[02:27:36.170 --> 02:27:39.330]  and the city to find a solution that reflects the interests and concerns of
[02:27:39.330 --> 02:27:41.210]  all stakeholders, their statement said.
[02:27:41.890 --> 02:27:45.290]  The proposed initiative divided Denver restaurant and bar owners who would have
[02:27:45.290 --> 02:27:47.210]  had the option to allow marijuana use.
[02:27:47.570 --> 02:27:50.650]  Riggs said Wednesday that she would approach the discussion with an open mind.
[02:27:51.090 --> 02:27:54.290]  I do understand there's a concern from their part that they need to have that
[02:27:54.290 --> 02:27:55.370]  they need to have addressed.
[02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:58.890]  She said of initiative backers, just as there's a concern from our side.
[02:27:59.810 --> 02:28:02.570]  For their part, city officials say they can't offer assurances.
[02:28:02.850 --> 02:28:05.730]  They also plan to gather input from neighborhood and community groups on the
[02:28:05.730 --> 02:28:06.050]  issue.
[02:28:06.610 --> 02:28:09.650]  We can't guarantee an outcome on it, obviously, but it's something we've been
[02:28:09.650 --> 02:28:11.290]  looking at, said Ashley Kilroy.
[02:28:11.410 --> 02:28:13.770]  Hancock's executive director for marijuana policy.
[02:28:14.090 --> 02:28:17.530]  We do believe that there's area for a conversation around this and that there's
[02:28:17.530 --> 02:28:19.170]  a lot of other considerations.
[02:28:19.570 --> 02:28:22.930]  Martina said his office isn't drawing bright lines, allowing policymakers to
[02:28:22.930 --> 02:28:23.970]  consider all options.
[02:28:23.970 --> 02:28:27.530]  First, I'm not going to throw down the legal hammer until we are specific.
[02:28:28.770 --> 02:28:29.330]  Proposals.
[02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:32.930]  He said until there are specific proposals, he said, sorry, the word proposals is
[02:28:32.970 --> 02:28:34.250]  out of the quotation.
[02:28:34.250 --> 02:28:35.050]  So that was confusing.
[02:28:35.570 --> 02:28:39.010]  Um, until our specific proposals, he said, adding, we're all working to find
[02:28:39.010 --> 02:28:42.130]  clarity within the law so that people can operate with certainty.
[02:28:42.570 --> 02:28:45.490]  If activists are dissatisfied with the coming decisions, though, they will have
[02:28:45.530 --> 02:28:49.690]  a fallback option going back to the ballot on their own next year and a
[02:28:49.690 --> 02:28:53.770]  presidential election that probably will have wider turnout than this fall.
[02:28:53.850 --> 02:28:57.850]  Divert sees an even greater change for passage, but he said a successful
[02:28:57.850 --> 02:29:00.170]  compromise with city officials and other interests.
[02:29:01.010 --> 02:29:05.170]  As more likely to result in a law that we know the city would be comfortable
[02:29:05.170 --> 02:29:08.330]  with and will not resist and will actually implement.
[02:29:09.170 --> 02:29:13.050]  So they pulled their ballot so that they can rewrite it to where they can actually
[02:29:13.050 --> 02:29:17.010]  make it a little bit more fair for the businesses and for the people who want to
[02:29:17.010 --> 02:29:17.530]  consume.
[02:29:17.810 --> 02:29:20.250]  So the law or the proposal is not dead.
[02:29:20.290 --> 02:29:22.810]  They're going to rewrite it and they're going to try again.
[02:29:23.410 --> 02:29:27.090]  It sounds like the city of Denver wants to work with the cannabis consumers.
[02:29:27.690 --> 02:29:30.730]  It seems like they understand the revenue that is available.
[02:29:31.090 --> 02:29:32.330]  They understand the need.
[02:29:33.090 --> 02:29:35.810]  And they mentioned in this article that out of staters don't have anywhere to
[02:29:35.810 --> 02:29:38.170]  consume, which is the main problem here.
[02:29:38.170 --> 02:29:41.290]  If those out of staters had somewhere to consume, they would go there, they would
[02:29:41.290 --> 02:29:43.250]  consume, and then they're going to get hungry.
[02:29:43.290 --> 02:29:46.090]  They're going to get thirsty and they're going to need entertainment, which is
[02:29:46.090 --> 02:29:50.650]  going to cause them or not cause them, but yeah, we'll cause them to go spend
[02:29:50.650 --> 02:29:55.530]  more money and participate in our economy and be part of our state's cash flow a
[02:29:55.530 --> 02:29:56.090]  little better.
[02:29:56.450 --> 02:29:57.810]  All right, guys, I'm going to go blow my nose.
[02:29:57.810 --> 02:29:59.970]  I'm catching a little bit of a head cold, but I will be right back.
[02:30:00.330 --> 02:30:01.290]  All right, guys, I am back.
[02:30:01.330 --> 02:30:04.090]  I apologize if my voice sounds a little bit nasally this week.
[02:30:04.090 --> 02:30:05.610]  I am catching a little bit of a head cold.
[02:30:05.610 --> 02:30:06.530]  I'm trying to fight it off.
[02:30:06.890 --> 02:30:09.330]  But like any other professional, the show must go on.
[02:30:09.330 --> 02:30:12.370]  So I'm doing the podcast and making the best of it for you.
[02:30:12.970 --> 02:30:16.330]  I appreciate you guys for tolerating my, my little bit of sniffles and a little
[02:30:16.330 --> 02:30:17.410]  bit of a nasally voice.
[02:30:17.770 --> 02:30:17.970]  All right.
[02:30:17.970 --> 02:30:19.650]  I've got another news article here for you guys.
[02:30:19.770 --> 02:30:22.090]  This is grounds for celebration.
[02:30:22.210 --> 02:30:24.650]  This may become a holiday in Colorado.
[02:30:24.650 --> 02:30:29.650]  If they continue to do this annually, the article here came from the cannabis and
[02:30:29.650 --> 02:30:32.450]  it was written by Kristen Wyatt from the Associated Press.
[02:30:32.890 --> 02:30:37.810]  And the headline says, get ready for the one day tax holiday on Colorado weed.
[02:30:38.650 --> 02:30:39.210]  Excuse me, guys.
[02:30:39.210 --> 02:30:40.010]  I got to take a drink here.
[02:30:40.090 --> 02:30:41.050]  Then we'll get the show on the road.
[02:30:44.130 --> 02:30:44.370]  All right.
[02:30:44.650 --> 02:30:47.890]  So the sub headline says, we're thinking there will be huge crowds, says a shop
[02:30:47.890 --> 02:30:52.170]  owner about the September 16 break on the hefty Colorado marijuana tax on
[02:30:52.170 --> 02:30:54.290]  recreational weed, thanks to the Tabor law.
[02:30:54.970 --> 02:30:55.210]  All right.
[02:30:55.250 --> 02:30:59.810]  So that sounds confusing to a lot of people, but taxes are ridiculously high
[02:30:59.810 --> 02:31:01.090]  on cannabis here in Colorado.
[02:31:01.930 --> 02:31:06.450]  And we're going to have a one day tax free cannabis day in Colorado.
[02:31:06.450 --> 02:31:07.170]  Let me read the article.
[02:31:07.170 --> 02:31:07.930]  I'll explain it to you.
[02:31:08.490 --> 02:31:11.770]  Colorado's unusual tax laws, forcing the state to suspend taxes on
[02:31:11.770 --> 02:31:13.690]  recreational marijuana for one day.
[02:31:14.170 --> 02:31:19.050]  The sales tax breakdown, the sales tax break on September 16th will save $20 off
[02:31:19.050 --> 02:31:22.530]  the price of a mid grade ounce of pot and the Denver area where ounces this
[02:31:22.530 --> 02:31:25.250]  summer sell for about $200 before tax.
[02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:29.690]  It's unusual for a state that has many times rejected sales tax holidays on
[02:31:29.690 --> 02:31:33.530]  things like school supplies, clothing, or any of energy efficient appliances.
[02:31:33.970 --> 02:31:38.330]  Officials say it could cost the state three to $4 million in one day.
[02:31:38.330 --> 02:31:43.090]  You guys are going to lose three to $4 million in taxes in a single day.
[02:31:43.850 --> 02:31:46.410]  Article goes on to say at first I was in disbelief.
[02:31:46.410 --> 02:31:50.090]  We were doing this said Sherry Hackett, who owns botanic care, a dispensary in
[02:31:50.090 --> 02:31:51.490]  the Denver suburb of North Glenn.
[02:31:51.810 --> 02:31:54.770]  And he goes, that's botanic care, not botanic care of the nutrient line.
[02:31:54.770 --> 02:31:55.850]  It's two separate businesses.
[02:31:56.370 --> 02:31:59.010]  Um, once our lawyers said, no, we really are doing this.
[02:31:59.050 --> 02:32:00.050]  We started getting ready.
[02:32:00.090 --> 02:32:01.850]  We're thinking there will be huge crowds.
[02:32:02.650 --> 02:32:06.650]  Hackett is printing signs to alert customers to the holiday and is trying to boost
[02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:09.290]  inventory for a one day crush of businesses.
[02:32:09.690 --> 02:32:13.330]  Colorado's taxpayer bill of rights requires voter approval for new taxes.
[02:32:13.690 --> 02:32:18.410]  In 2013, a year after legalizing recreational pot voters approved the 25%
[02:32:18.410 --> 02:32:22.050]  taxes, but the law requires that any new taxes be waived and refunded.
[02:32:22.050 --> 02:32:25.410]  If overall state collections exceed projections given to voters when
[02:32:25.410 --> 02:32:26.850]  they approved the new taxes.
[02:32:27.210 --> 02:32:31.770]  In this case, the pot taxes were projected to raise $70 million in 2014.
[02:32:32.170 --> 02:32:36.570]  They actually raised $58 million, but because overall tax collections that
[02:32:36.570 --> 02:32:40.250]  year exceeded protect projections, Colorado must ask voters for
[02:32:40.250 --> 02:32:41.330]  permission to keep the money.
[02:32:41.810 --> 02:32:45.410]  And they comply with the requirement that the taxes revert to zero lawmakers
[02:32:45.410 --> 02:32:47.650]  settled on a short one day tax waiver.
[02:32:49.010 --> 02:32:50.970]  That day is September 16th.
[02:32:51.010 --> 02:32:55.610]  One day after the state's books for the previous fiscal year are made final.
[02:32:55.690 --> 02:32:56.010]  All right.
[02:32:56.010 --> 02:33:00.010]  So if you guys want to come to Colorado and buy a quarter of cannabis at a shop,
[02:33:00.090 --> 02:33:02.010]  September 16th would be your day to do it.
[02:33:02.650 --> 02:33:03.970]  There will be no taxes.
[02:33:04.370 --> 02:33:06.610]  Uh, marijuana won't be completely tax-free that day.
[02:33:06.610 --> 02:33:10.530]  A regular 2.9% sales tax still applies as do medical marijuana
[02:33:10.530 --> 02:33:12.530]  taxes and local pot taxes.
[02:33:13.130 --> 02:33:13.450]  All right.
[02:33:13.450 --> 02:33:18.050]  So the extra local taxes that we pay here in Pueblo will still be tacked on.
[02:33:18.690 --> 02:33:21.610]  For pot retailers, the holiday poses a bizarre supply dilemma.
[02:33:21.610 --> 02:33:24.850]  They'll want plenty of weed on hand to sell to throngs of pot shoppers.
[02:33:24.890 --> 02:33:27.970]  But if they stock too much product, they'll forego their one day waiver
[02:33:27.970 --> 02:33:30.050]  on the 15% excise tax that they pay.
[02:33:30.050 --> 02:33:33.570]  Marijuana wholesalers, a savvy retailer would want to have shelves
[02:33:33.570 --> 02:33:36.610]  full enough to supply crowds, but bare enough to take maximum of van
[02:33:36.650 --> 02:33:40.090]  advantage of the restocking without paying excise taxes before
[02:33:40.090 --> 02:33:42.410]  the business closes September 16.
[02:33:43.290 --> 02:33:46.650]  Ryan Fox, who owns two Denver dispensaries and also a wholesale
[02:33:46.650 --> 02:33:49.730]  pot growing company, hasn't decided what sorts of deals to offer that day,
[02:33:49.770 --> 02:33:51.450]  but he's anticipating a windfall.
[02:33:51.810 --> 02:33:54.410]  Our hopes are high and we're going to push as hard as we can to see
[02:33:54.450 --> 02:33:55.730]  as many customers as we can.
[02:33:55.730 --> 02:34:00.290]  Fox said, Colorado voters will decide in November whether to keep the pot taxes.
[02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:05.090]  The 2013 taxing measure passed two to one and state politicians seemed confident
[02:34:05.090 --> 02:34:06.930]  voters will reauthorize the taxes.
[02:34:07.330 --> 02:34:11.770]  The state constitution requires refunds only in a new tax, uh, in a new taxes
[02:34:11.810 --> 02:34:14.050]  first year, so voters won't be asked again.
[02:34:14.770 --> 02:34:14.930]  All right.
[02:34:14.930 --> 02:34:15.730]  I read that a little weird.
[02:34:15.730 --> 02:34:17.410]  So I'm going to read that last line again.
[02:34:17.410 --> 02:34:23.370]  It says the state constitution requires refunds only in a new taxes first year.
[02:34:23.370 --> 02:34:24.770]  So voters won't be asked again.
[02:34:25.130 --> 02:34:28.850]  I kind of read that funny the first time, but this only comes up when a tax is in
[02:34:28.850 --> 02:34:32.650]  its first year, so they won't be asking us this again, the one day tax break.
[02:34:32.650 --> 02:34:35.410]  Won't put too much of a dent in the state's overall pot revenue.
[02:34:35.770 --> 02:34:37.610]  Colorado's pot collections are blooming.
[02:34:37.690 --> 02:34:42.810]  Marijuana tax revenues jumped from 25 million in the first five months of 2014
[02:34:42.970 --> 02:34:47.290]  to 44 million in the first five months of this year, the increase has been
[02:34:47.290 --> 02:34:49.370]  attributed to additional stores opening.
[02:34:49.810 --> 02:34:56.650]  Colorado now has 380 recreational pot dispensaries and 480 licensed recreational
[02:34:56.650 --> 02:35:01.690]  pot growers up from a few dozen in the state's first months of retail recreational
[02:35:01.690 --> 02:35:01.970]  pot.
[02:35:02.490 --> 02:35:06.730]  And you guys, those 480 recreational growers are actually commercial grows
[02:35:06.730 --> 02:35:10.610]  that only vend to a dispensary is recreational dispensaries.
[02:35:10.610 --> 02:35:12.370]  That does not include private grows.
[02:35:12.570 --> 02:35:15.290]  So there are a lot more private grows that are not counted.
[02:35:15.890 --> 02:35:19.970]  So you guys, we made so much tax money that we have to give our state a tax
[02:35:19.970 --> 02:35:20.490]  break.
[02:35:20.530 --> 02:35:24.250]  All of the customers that come to buy cannabis on September 16th will not have
[02:35:24.250 --> 02:35:27.170]  to pay the regular cannabis tax.
[02:35:27.170 --> 02:35:27.890]  That's going to be awesome.
[02:35:27.890 --> 02:35:31.290]  So if you come from out of state, we hope to see you at the spot dispensary on
[02:35:31.290 --> 02:35:32.210]  September 16th.
[02:35:32.210 --> 02:35:35.250]  If you come from out of state, if you come from anywhere, make sure you ask for
[02:35:35.250 --> 02:35:35.410]  me.
[02:35:35.610 --> 02:35:38.170]  I'll try to come out from the back and say, hi, shake your hand and see what's
[02:35:38.170 --> 02:35:38.330]  up.
[02:35:40.130 --> 02:35:40.490]  You know what?
[02:35:40.490 --> 02:35:42.170]  I won't be at work on September 16th.
[02:35:42.250 --> 02:35:42.810]  That's funny.
[02:35:42.850 --> 02:35:43.490]  I won't be there.
[02:35:43.530 --> 02:35:44.530]  So don't come to say hi to me.
[02:35:44.530 --> 02:35:48.450]  I'm seeing Morgan heritage and Damian Marley, uh, and Taurus Riley on September
[02:35:48.450 --> 02:35:48.890]  15th.
[02:35:48.890 --> 02:35:51.210]  And there's a good chance I will not show up for work on the 16th.
[02:35:51.210 --> 02:35:54.490]  So enjoy your tax free day without me.
[02:35:54.530 --> 02:35:55.250]  That sounds like fun.
[02:35:55.530 --> 02:35:55.690]  All right.
[02:35:55.690 --> 02:35:57.690]  I've got another news article to read to you.
[02:35:57.690 --> 02:35:58.730]  I've actually got a couple more.
[02:35:59.090 --> 02:36:01.210]  Let's see how long we've been recording.
[02:36:02.170 --> 02:36:03.170]  You know what?
[02:36:03.770 --> 02:36:04.330]  Let's see.
[02:36:04.330 --> 02:36:07.450]  We've been going 21 minutes.
[02:36:07.450 --> 02:36:07.610]  All right.
[02:36:07.610 --> 02:36:11.210]  I can get two news articles and in the next 10 or 15 minutes, let's do this.
[02:36:11.650 --> 02:36:14.610]  So this article, I've got two articles that I'm going to read back to back.
[02:36:14.610 --> 02:36:18.890]  This one came out on September 8th and then the next article came out shortly
[02:36:18.890 --> 02:36:20.930]  after that it came out on September 9th.
[02:36:21.450 --> 02:36:22.930]  So they are related articles.
[02:36:23.770 --> 02:36:25.130]  I'm going to go ahead and get into the first one.
[02:36:25.130 --> 02:36:28.770]  This is once again from the cannabis written by David Magoya and Ricardo Baca.
[02:36:29.810 --> 02:36:34.490]  The headline says Denver recalls Mahatma pot extract over unapproved pesticides.
[02:36:34.890 --> 02:36:38.010]  The order comes after an investigation by the Denver post and lab testing
[02:36:38.010 --> 02:36:42.010]  revealed three unapproved pesticides in a pair of Mahatma concentrates products.
[02:36:42.610 --> 02:36:46.330]  The article goes on like this state and Denver inspectors on Tuesday, ordered
[02:36:46.330 --> 02:36:49.570]  a recall of marijuana extracts sold by Mahatma concentrates at the Denver
[02:36:49.570 --> 02:36:52.490]  post revealed contained high levels of unapproved pesticides.
[02:36:52.890 --> 02:36:56.770]  Mahatma co-owner Brett Mouser confirmed the recall of products that were derived
[02:36:56.770 --> 02:37:00.450]  from marijuana plants grown by a supplier treatments unlimited treatments.
[02:37:00.450 --> 02:37:03.810]  Co-owner has acknowledged the Denver company used the unapproved pesticides
[02:37:04.090 --> 02:37:07.930]  treatments earlier this year had a number of its plants quarantined by city
[02:37:07.930 --> 02:37:12.090]  officials because of pesticides can turn concerns and later released.
[02:37:13.290 --> 02:37:16.530]  Tuesday's recall was ordered by the Denver department of environment or
[02:37:16.690 --> 02:37:19.730]  environmental health and the Colorado marijuana enforcement division.
[02:37:20.010 --> 02:37:23.290]  Following a story by the post that revealed lab tests detected three
[02:37:23.330 --> 02:37:26.050]  unapproved pesticides in a pair of Mahatma products.
[02:37:26.570 --> 02:37:30.050]  The test commissioned by the post found levels of, oh gosh, uh,
[02:37:30.090 --> 02:37:33.810]  micro butanil and imidachloropid,
[02:37:34.130 --> 02:37:38.650]  imidachloropid in Mahatma's black label grapefruit, uh,
[02:37:38.690 --> 02:37:40.530]  black label grapefruit diesel wax.
[02:37:40.530 --> 02:37:45.370]  That were six times the maximum amount allowed by federal government on any food
[02:37:45.370 --> 02:37:46.090]  product.
[02:37:46.090 --> 02:37:49.690]  The pesticides also were found in Mahatma's black label alpha blue shatter,
[02:37:49.690 --> 02:37:55.090]  but at lower levels, measurable amounts of Avermectin were found in both samples.
[02:37:55.410 --> 02:37:59.890]  Only Mahatma products showing an origin number of four zero three dash zero zero
[02:37:59.890 --> 02:38:02.730]  one one four on their labels are subject to the recall.
[02:38:03.090 --> 02:38:06.210]  It was unclear how many products with that origin number were sold.
[02:38:06.650 --> 02:38:09.370]  Mouser said he is preparing to handle return products.
[02:38:10.050 --> 02:38:14.170]  Old placards were placed on locked storage units for when recalled product comes
[02:38:14.170 --> 02:38:16.570]  back into Mahatma. He told the post in an email,
[02:38:17.010 --> 02:38:18.970]  once product reaches us on this recall,
[02:38:19.250 --> 02:38:22.570]  we will be sending it out for testing and once results are back and show past,
[02:38:22.570 --> 02:38:25.090]  then the product will be released from the city of Denver's hold.
[02:38:25.410 --> 02:38:26.810]  If product does not pass,
[02:38:27.090 --> 02:38:30.530]  we will be quarantining and contacting the med for further instruction.
[02:38:32.010 --> 02:38:34.930]  Tuesday's actions are part of a supply chain investigation.
[02:38:34.930 --> 02:38:38.810]  According to Dan Roland spokes spokesman for Denver's office of marijuana policy,
[02:38:38.810 --> 02:38:41.170]  adding that additional recalls are possible.
[02:38:41.610 --> 02:38:45.250]  Inspectors visited Mahatma's facilities and poured through records and products
[02:38:45.530 --> 02:38:48.050]  and owner at treatments, which also operates altitude.
[02:38:48.050 --> 02:38:52.090]  The dispensary shops in Denver said he expects agency inspectors to visit his
[02:38:52.090 --> 02:38:53.370]  facility on Wednesday.
[02:38:53.970 --> 02:38:57.010]  Pesticides typically are applied while a plant is growing,
[02:38:57.010 --> 02:38:59.290]  not after it has been harvested, dried and sold.
[02:38:59.650 --> 02:39:03.450]  The post investigation found Mahatma had inadvertently mislabeled its products to
[02:39:03.450 --> 02:39:05.890]  indicate the concentrate came from plants. It had grown.
[02:39:06.330 --> 02:39:09.890]  The pesticides were not included in the products labels list of ingredients.
[02:39:10.290 --> 02:39:14.450]  State law requires labels to reflect any pesticide or herbicide or contaminant
[02:39:14.450 --> 02:39:18.090]  that was used at any stage of a marijuana products processing.
[02:39:18.570 --> 02:39:21.930]  Though the law also requires cannabis businesses to test for pesticides,
[02:39:21.930 --> 02:39:24.370]  that provision has not yet been enforced.
[02:39:24.890 --> 02:39:28.690]  Mouser previously said the businesses labels are only as accurate as the
[02:39:28.690 --> 02:39:30.010]  information provided to them.
[02:39:30.490 --> 02:39:33.570]  We're going by what our clients give us as far as an ingredient list.
[02:39:33.570 --> 02:39:34.410]  He told the post,
[02:39:34.610 --> 02:39:38.370]  we go over the ingredients list and we check that list again against the
[02:39:38.370 --> 02:39:41.850]  approved pesticides list. If we find something that isn't on the list,
[02:39:41.850 --> 02:39:43.530]  we notify the processing client.
[02:39:44.370 --> 02:39:47.650]  The pesticides found in the post tests are among hundreds of Colorado
[02:39:47.650 --> 02:39:52.090]  Department of Agriculture has not approved for use on marijuana because
[02:39:52.090 --> 02:39:56.170]  product labels restrict their use to certain plant and crops or to specific
[02:39:56.170 --> 02:39:59.010]  locations such as open fields and residential gardens.
[02:39:59.530 --> 02:40:01.530]  Because marijuana is illegal under federal law,
[02:40:01.570 --> 02:40:05.530]  the U S environmental protection agency will not certify any pesticide for use on
[02:40:05.530 --> 02:40:08.610]  cannabis, nor allow any testing. As a result,
[02:40:08.610 --> 02:40:12.530]  there are no safety limits established for their use specific to cannabis or
[02:40:12.530 --> 02:40:15.090]  their ingestion by consumers. However,
[02:40:15.130 --> 02:40:18.770]  the products are allowed on other consumable items such as strawberries,
[02:40:18.770 --> 02:40:19.810]  tomatoes, and grapes.
[02:40:19.810 --> 02:40:24.730]  Though the level of pesticide residues allowed on each does vary the post found
[02:40:24.730 --> 02:40:29.410]  pesticides levels as much as six times the highest amount allowed on an edible
[02:40:29.410 --> 02:40:30.250]  food product.
[02:40:30.330 --> 02:40:34.890]  And as high as 1,800 times the level Denver officials allowed to be on release
[02:40:34.890 --> 02:40:35.930]  plants at hand core,
[02:40:35.970 --> 02:40:39.610]  it had quarantined earlier this year over pesticide concerns.
[02:40:40.290 --> 02:40:45.290]  This plant had 1800 times the level that Denver allowed to be released.
[02:40:45.970 --> 02:40:49.050]  This plant had been sprayed to shit, whatever they were,
[02:40:49.250 --> 02:40:50.250]  whatever material they use.
[02:40:50.250 --> 02:40:53.530]  These guys were spraying the fuck out of it all the time and way too
[02:40:53.530 --> 02:40:55.210]  concentrated. This is crazy.
[02:40:55.210 --> 02:40:56.770]  I don't know what kind of bugs they were trying to treat for,
[02:40:56.770 --> 02:40:59.650]  but they are not quality farmers. I'll go on with the article.
[02:40:59.650 --> 02:41:03.290]  It says enforcement of the state's list of allowable pesticides is sporadic at
[02:41:03.290 --> 02:41:06.450]  best with most city and state officials responding to complaints rather than
[02:41:06.450 --> 02:41:07.850]  inspecting each facility.
[02:41:08.370 --> 02:41:11.970]  Colorado had about five years of medical marijuana cultivation and sales before
[02:41:11.970 --> 02:41:16.970]  the state in 2013 began compiling a list of which pesticides could be used on
[02:41:17.010 --> 02:41:20.330]  the plants. Officials admit that reflects an imperfect system.
[02:41:21.250 --> 02:41:23.970]  Colorado's marijuana SAR, Andrew Friedman said,
[02:41:23.970 --> 02:41:26.210]  the state is dealing with the problem as best it can.
[02:41:27.090 --> 02:41:31.330]  Many growers are new to regulated pesticide use beyond that, like banking,
[02:41:31.370 --> 02:41:35.170]  the pesticide regulatory system is heavily built on federal involvement,
[02:41:35.170 --> 02:41:38.930]  said Friedman director of governor John Hickenlooper's office of marijuana
[02:41:38.930 --> 02:41:42.730]  coordination. I know that's not a completely satisfying answer.
[02:41:42.730 --> 02:41:45.610]  And honestly, I wish we had these challenges solved by day one,
[02:41:45.650 --> 02:41:50.050]  but we're working toward an enforceable solution that also protects consumers
[02:41:50.370 --> 02:41:53.930]  from other contaminants such as molds. So you guys,
[02:41:53.930 --> 02:41:55.810]  they are trying to keep the cannabis safe.
[02:41:55.810 --> 02:41:57.970]  They're testing it now to find out what is in it.
[02:41:58.490 --> 02:42:01.450]  They are figuring out what pesticides we should and should not be using.
[02:42:01.450 --> 02:42:04.490]  They're setting levels. They're trying to keep the consumer safe.
[02:42:04.730 --> 02:42:06.330]  We have taken this out of the basement.
[02:42:06.370 --> 02:42:09.570]  We've put it into the store and now we're putting it into laboratories.
[02:42:09.570 --> 02:42:14.330]  I hope this shows that Colorado is doing our best to make a legitimate
[02:42:14.330 --> 02:42:19.050]  business out of cannabis. This isn't just weed anymore. This is a product.
[02:42:19.090 --> 02:42:22.290]  This is a commercial product that's being tested. I'm impressed.
[02:42:22.730 --> 02:42:23.690]  But at the same time,
[02:42:23.730 --> 02:42:27.410]  I'm bummed out that there are well-known companies like Mahatma that are still
[02:42:27.930 --> 02:42:30.850]  screwing it up and mislabeling and making mistakes like this.
[02:42:30.850 --> 02:42:32.490]  Mahatma has won cannabis cups.
[02:42:32.730 --> 02:42:35.570]  I've done business with Mahatma and they've always been super kind to me.
[02:42:35.850 --> 02:42:38.890]  So it's a little disappointing to see an industry leader come out and make a
[02:42:38.890 --> 02:42:41.490]  mistake like this. They will get it together.
[02:42:41.530 --> 02:42:42.970]  They'll get their shit together. And like they said,
[02:42:42.970 --> 02:42:45.930]  they were only going by the labels that they were given by the growers.
[02:42:46.210 --> 02:42:48.570]  So that was probably not their fault.
[02:42:48.570 --> 02:42:50.450]  I want to go ahead and give them the benefit of the doubt.
[02:42:50.450 --> 02:42:54.410]  Mahatma didn't do this on purpose. They were just going off of labels.
[02:42:54.650 --> 02:42:58.250]  So this next article is completely related to this.
[02:42:58.690 --> 02:43:03.690]  A lot of this testing and pesticide testing and safety inspections have all
[02:43:03.690 --> 02:43:05.730]  stemmed from a few small incidents,
[02:43:06.410 --> 02:43:10.130]  but it has sparked a lot of investigation and it is going to improve our
[02:43:10.130 --> 02:43:11.490]  industry in my opinion.
[02:43:11.890 --> 02:43:15.970]  So I'm going to read another article that came out the day after the last
[02:43:15.970 --> 02:43:20.290]  article. This one says Colorado state ag officials launch probes on pesticides.
[02:43:20.290 --> 02:43:23.930]  Colorado department of agriculture has investigations underway on pesticide
[02:43:23.930 --> 02:43:25.890]  misuse by Denver marijuana businesses,
[02:43:25.930 --> 02:43:28.210]  Mahatma concentrates and treatments unlimited.
[02:43:28.690 --> 02:43:31.170]  So this is pretty much a followup of the last article I read.
[02:43:31.170 --> 02:43:34.010]  This is again by David Magoya and Ricardo Baca.
[02:43:34.370 --> 02:43:38.770]  And the article goes like this Colorado agriculture officials have,
[02:43:38.970 --> 02:43:42.650]  have opened an investigation into a marijuana grow operation named in a report
[02:43:42.650 --> 02:43:45.730]  by the Denver post about pesticide residues residues.
[02:43:45.730 --> 02:43:48.810]  And they confirmed a second business named in the story was already under
[02:43:48.810 --> 02:43:51.530]  scrutiny. It is unclear which of the two companies,
[02:43:51.530 --> 02:43:53.690]  Mahatma concentrates or treatments unlimited,
[02:43:53.730 --> 02:43:57.250]  both in Denver was already under scrutiny and officials with the Colorado
[02:43:57.250 --> 02:43:59.370]  department of agriculture would not elaborate.
[02:43:59.970 --> 02:44:03.770]  But the agency said investigations into other businesses used to pesticides is
[02:44:03.770 --> 02:44:05.170]  the focus of its probe.
[02:44:06.010 --> 02:44:10.250]  The CDA has one ongoing investigation with one of the growers and based on the
[02:44:10.250 --> 02:44:11.770]  information supplied in the article,
[02:44:12.250 --> 02:44:16.290]  we have opened a second investigation into the other name grower to determine if
[02:44:16.290 --> 02:44:20.370]  their pesticide use is in compliance with the Colorado pesticide applicators act.
[02:44:20.490 --> 02:44:25.010]  The CDA spokeswoman, Christy light cap set in an email penalties on the growers
[02:44:25.010 --> 02:44:28.650]  could range from a simple order to stop the prohibited conduct to fines up to
[02:44:28.650 --> 02:44:31.810]  $1,000 for each violation under the act.
[02:44:31.810 --> 02:44:35.570]  Repeat offenders fines are doubled and chronic offenders face potential license
[02:44:35.570 --> 02:44:36.730]  sanctions. Light cap said,
[02:44:37.250 --> 02:44:40.650]  although laws require marijuana businesses to test for pesticide residues,
[02:44:40.890 --> 02:44:45.010]  that rule has not only has not been enforced because only one facility is
[02:44:45.010 --> 02:44:46.610]  certified to do that analysis.
[02:44:46.970 --> 02:44:50.530]  Colorado marijuana enforcement division rules show marijuana that tests positive
[02:44:50.530 --> 02:44:53.930]  for unapproved pesticides and other contaminants must be destroyed or
[02:44:53.930 --> 02:44:57.810]  decontaminated because I don't know how to decontaminate cannabis.
[02:44:58.130 --> 02:45:01.610]  You can't really wash it off. So I think your option is to destroy it.
[02:45:01.970 --> 02:45:05.210]  The post on Tuesday reported that two of eight lab tests that commissioned on
[02:45:05.210 --> 02:45:09.050]  marijuana extracts found three unapproved pesticides and products made by
[02:45:09.050 --> 02:45:12.930]  Mahatma. Although Mahatma labels indicated the tainted marijuana used to make
[02:45:12.930 --> 02:45:15.090]  these extracts came from its own growth facility.
[02:45:15.370 --> 02:45:18.090]  Documents showed the cannabis actually came from treatments.
[02:45:18.370 --> 02:45:21.970]  A treatments co-owner admitted that the company had used products that contained
[02:45:21.970 --> 02:45:24.370]  the unapproved pesticides treatments,
[02:45:24.370 --> 02:45:25.970]  which operates a pair of altitude.
[02:45:25.970 --> 02:45:29.690]  The dispensary shops in Denver was one of 11 marijuana growers to have about
[02:45:29.690 --> 02:45:33.730]  1000, a hundred thousand plants quarantined earlier this year by Denver health
[02:45:33.730 --> 02:45:35.570]  officials over pesticide concerns.
[02:45:36.330 --> 02:45:38.570]  The city allowed most of the plants back into commerce,
[02:45:38.970 --> 02:45:40.850]  including those grown by treatments.
[02:45:40.850 --> 02:45:44.210]  When levels of pesticide residues dropped to the lowest amount allowed on food
[02:45:44.250 --> 02:45:46.050]  crops to other businesses,
[02:45:46.050 --> 02:45:48.970]  destroyed the plants rather than wait for pesticide test results.
[02:45:49.450 --> 02:45:52.610]  CDA's announcement on Wednesday came a day after the Denver department of
[02:45:52.610 --> 02:45:55.890]  environmental health issued a broad recall of them of Mahatma products.
[02:45:55.890 --> 02:45:57.570]  Following a visit to that shop,
[02:45:58.050 --> 02:46:01.330]  inspectors were expected to be at treatments growing warehouse on Wednesday.
[02:46:01.970 --> 02:46:05.650]  Retailers with recalled products were instructed to remove them from store
[02:46:05.650 --> 02:46:09.330]  shelves and either destroy the products in compliance with MED regulations or
[02:46:09.330 --> 02:46:13.130]  return the products to the manufacturer said Dan Roland spokesman for the
[02:46:13.130 --> 02:46:15.210]  Denver's office of marijuana policy.
[02:46:15.770 --> 02:46:19.410]  Consumers should either destroy any recalled product they have or return it to
[02:46:19.410 --> 02:46:20.890]  the store of purchase. Roland said,
[02:46:21.250 --> 02:46:25.250]  this information of potential pesticide misuse is concerning light cap set in an
[02:46:25.250 --> 02:46:26.410]  announcing investigation.
[02:46:27.330 --> 02:46:31.210]  The CDA has identified a list of products that can be used on marijuana and it
[02:46:31.210 --> 02:46:34.690]  has, it has been available to growers for well over one year.
[02:46:35.130 --> 02:46:38.450]  Pesticides on marijuana is a controversial topic because no science,
[02:46:38.690 --> 02:46:42.610]  no science exists to say which products are safe for consumers.
[02:46:43.410 --> 02:46:46.890]  Although several pesticides are approved for use on some fruit and vegetable
[02:46:46.890 --> 02:46:47.250]  crops,
[02:46:47.250 --> 02:46:50.930]  the U S environmental protection agency cannot say whether they are safe on
[02:46:50.930 --> 02:46:54.170]  marijuana because the plant is illegal under federal law.
[02:46:54.690 --> 02:46:57.610]  CDA has comply compiled a list of pesticides,
[02:46:57.650 --> 02:47:01.890]  some of them so non-toxic that they do not require federal registration that can
[02:47:01.890 --> 02:47:05.450]  be used on marijuana based on their label restrictions, not on their safety.
[02:47:05.970 --> 02:47:09.690]  It is a violation of federal law to use any pesticide contrary to its label
[02:47:09.690 --> 02:47:10.530]  directions.
[02:47:10.770 --> 02:47:14.490]  CDA has chosen those products whose label restrictions were so broad that using
[02:47:14.490 --> 02:47:16.810]  them on marijuana would not be in violation,
[02:47:17.290 --> 02:47:21.370]  but CDA officials have constantly said they do not recommend using pesticides on
[02:47:21.370 --> 02:47:22.210]  marijuana,
[02:47:22.210 --> 02:47:25.930]  nor will they say those products that appear on its list of approved pesticides
[02:47:25.930 --> 02:47:27.170]  are safe to consumers.
[02:47:27.570 --> 02:47:31.170]  We are in a completely new business here and we're building a space shuttle that
[02:47:31.170 --> 02:47:33.890]  is not done that has not been done anywhere else.
[02:47:34.130 --> 02:47:35.810]  Colorado agricultural commissioner,
[02:47:35.810 --> 02:47:37.690]  Don Brown said other States,
[02:47:37.690 --> 02:47:41.530]  including New Hampshire have restricted pesticides allowed on marijuana only to
[02:47:41.530 --> 02:47:44.810]  those so non-toxic that federal registration is not required.
[02:47:45.330 --> 02:47:46.690]  Colorado nearly did the same,
[02:47:46.690 --> 02:47:50.450]  but the industry argued that non-toxic pesticides, mainly organics,
[02:47:50.690 --> 02:47:51.490]  such as name,
[02:47:51.490 --> 02:47:55.530]  cinnamon and peppermint oils weren't nearly strong enough to combat effectively
[02:47:55.530 --> 02:47:59.010]  the pests and mildews that most commonly attack their crop.
[02:48:00.330 --> 02:48:00.530]  You know,
[02:48:00.530 --> 02:48:01.370]  I'm,
[02:48:01.370 --> 02:48:05.570]  I'm kind of torn by pesticides because I run a commercial grow and we cannot
[02:48:05.570 --> 02:48:08.690]  lose a million dollar harvest to bugs.
[02:48:08.770 --> 02:48:12.410]  So we have to do something to keep bugs off of it.
[02:48:12.770 --> 02:48:14.690]  I agree with this last statement here that,
[02:48:15.170 --> 02:48:16.690]  organics such as neem oil,
[02:48:16.690 --> 02:48:21.090]  cinnamon and peppermint oils and rosemary oil is something and cedar oil is also
[02:48:21.090 --> 02:48:22.050]  something commonly used.
[02:48:22.490 --> 02:48:24.490]  Those oils are great as a preventative.
[02:48:25.210 --> 02:48:27.730]  Those are wonderful on a small scale grow.
[02:48:28.210 --> 02:48:28.890]  Unfortunately,
[02:48:28.890 --> 02:48:33.610]  those types of oils will end up in your concentrate just like all of these
[02:48:33.610 --> 02:48:34.450]  pesticides.
[02:48:35.890 --> 02:48:38.050]  I can taste neem oil in your dabs.
[02:48:38.330 --> 02:48:41.970]  If you spray neem oil on your plants early before flower or just before flower
[02:48:41.970 --> 02:48:43.130]  or early into flower,
[02:48:43.450 --> 02:48:45.450]  I can taste the neem oil in your extracts.
[02:48:46.410 --> 02:48:48.770]  Recently I had some dabs given to me by an artist.
[02:48:48.770 --> 02:48:52.410]  He wanted me to sample them and I could taste the rosemary oil in his
[02:48:52.410 --> 02:48:53.250]  concentrate.
[02:48:53.330 --> 02:48:57.570]  So using essential oils isn't always the cure and all the preventative,
[02:48:57.570 --> 02:48:58.690]  the answer also.
[02:48:59.250 --> 02:49:01.730]  Sometimes you have to use some type of a pesticide,
[02:49:01.730 --> 02:49:04.170]  especially when you're getting clones from other people.
[02:49:05.010 --> 02:49:08.850]  That's where I find I get the bugs the most often is when I get a clone as a
[02:49:08.850 --> 02:49:09.970]  gift from another grower.
[02:49:10.290 --> 02:49:12.610]  It almost always has some kind of a bug on it.
[02:49:12.770 --> 02:49:13.770]  So when you get a new clone,
[02:49:14.210 --> 02:49:15.250]  that's what I treat with.
[02:49:15.330 --> 02:49:19.170]  I use heavy shit depending on what the clone is and what bugs I see on it.
[02:49:19.170 --> 02:49:23.250]  But I will use some pretty radical treatment because I cannot risk my mother
[02:49:23.250 --> 02:49:24.810]  plants getting spider mites.
[02:49:24.810 --> 02:49:27.610]  I cannot risk my mother plants getting broad mites.
[02:49:27.610 --> 02:49:28.450]  I'm a breeder.
[02:49:28.730 --> 02:49:30.250]  I rely on my mother plants.
[02:49:30.290 --> 02:49:31.290]  That is my future.
[02:49:31.450 --> 02:49:32.170]  That is my work.
[02:49:32.170 --> 02:49:34.330]  I've spent years developing those mother plants.
[02:49:34.330 --> 02:49:35.730]  If bugs destroyed those,
[02:49:36.290 --> 02:49:37.570]  oh, I would be devastated.
[02:49:37.850 --> 02:49:42.450]  So I do understand the need for a little bit of a stronger pesticide in a
[02:49:42.450 --> 02:49:43.530]  commercial environment.
[02:49:44.250 --> 02:49:46.650]  Something that I have recently started doing,
[02:49:46.650 --> 02:49:49.970]  I am studying for a department of agriculture,
[02:49:51.170 --> 02:49:53.210]  pesticide applicators test.
[02:49:54.650 --> 02:49:59.530]  I think anybody that is spraying pesticides in any type of a garden should have
[02:49:59.530 --> 02:50:01.250]  to at least examine this test.
[02:50:01.250 --> 02:50:02.090]  You don't have to pass it.
[02:50:02.130 --> 02:50:03.450]  I work in a commercial facility.
[02:50:03.450 --> 02:50:06.010]  I will be training new employees on pesticide safety.
[02:50:06.010 --> 02:50:07.370]  I'm required to take this test.
[02:50:07.770 --> 02:50:11.850]  I would encourage anybody who's going to play with pesticides to take this test.
[02:50:12.330 --> 02:50:16.490]  It will teach you a lot about pesticide safety to start with how to handle a
[02:50:16.490 --> 02:50:18.770]  pesticide, how to apply a pesticide safely,
[02:50:18.770 --> 02:50:20.050]  what to wear when you're doing it,
[02:50:20.050 --> 02:50:23.410]  but it will also teach you what is in almost everything.
[02:50:23.890 --> 02:50:25.810]  There are very few, uh,
[02:50:26.090 --> 02:50:29.690]  chemicals that they're using and all these brands are just different brands with
[02:50:29.690 --> 02:50:30.330]  different labels.
[02:50:30.330 --> 02:50:32.370]  It's the same chemical in almost everything.
[02:50:32.730 --> 02:50:34.770]  And if you learn what chemicals kill, which bugs,
[02:50:35.130 --> 02:50:36.490]  it makes your job a lot easier.
[02:50:36.810 --> 02:50:39.250]  So I recommend studying up on this pesticide test,
[02:50:39.250 --> 02:50:43.130]  go to your state's agri department of agriculture website and see if there's an
[02:50:43.130 --> 02:50:44.090]  applicator test.
[02:50:44.450 --> 02:50:47.770]  Anybody who does a job like an exterminator or something like that has to pass
[02:50:47.770 --> 02:50:49.610]  this test. So it's available in your area.
[02:50:50.010 --> 02:50:53.010]  It'll help you combat your pest problems a lot better.
[02:50:53.010 --> 02:50:56.210]  And it will also keep you safe. Just something I recommend.
[02:50:56.530 --> 02:50:58.370]  It's something I'm doing. So do it with me. It'll be fun.
[02:50:58.410 --> 02:50:59.850]  We can do it together. All right.
[02:51:00.050 --> 02:51:04.850]  So my point with these articles is that we are not screwing around here in
[02:51:04.850 --> 02:51:08.850]  Colorado. We are actually testing products to make sure that things are safe.
[02:51:09.050 --> 02:51:11.050]  We have stepped up our game. We're going to separate,
[02:51:11.290 --> 02:51:14.370]  I'm going to see a lot of businesses fall apart because of all this new
[02:51:14.370 --> 02:51:16.930]  regulation with pesticide testing. Uh,
[02:51:16.970 --> 02:51:21.050]  a lot of the growers that think they are master growers and pro growers are not
[02:51:21.050 --> 02:51:22.290]  going to know what to do.
[02:51:22.330 --> 02:51:24.570]  Once they start getting rid of some of the pesticides,
[02:51:25.050 --> 02:51:28.570]  we're going to have to start using an integrated pest management system with
[02:51:28.610 --> 02:51:32.410]  live insects. It's going to be a whole different ball game pretty soon.
[02:51:32.650 --> 02:51:35.610]  I'm going to write that down because that sounds like a good episode. I,
[02:51:36.010 --> 02:51:37.610]  oh, excuse me. It sounds like a good episode idea.
[02:51:37.610 --> 02:51:39.850]  We could talk about integrated guy. Now I'm burping.
[02:51:39.850 --> 02:51:42.850]  We could talk about integrated pest management on a whole nother episode.
[02:51:43.730 --> 02:51:47.450]  So I'm writing a note of that. IPM, IPM. There we go.
[02:51:47.770 --> 02:51:50.850]  We'll try to get Sean over to talk about organic integrated pest management.
[02:51:50.890 --> 02:51:53.490]  That'll be great. All right, you guys, let's see how long I've been talking.
[02:51:53.490 --> 02:51:57.050]  I feel like I've been going for at least 35 minutes. Let's see. 37 minutes.
[02:51:57.050 --> 02:51:58.330]  I think that's a long podcast.
[02:51:58.330 --> 02:52:01.410]  You guys like to listen to about 36 minutes worth of show before you get bored.
[02:52:01.410 --> 02:52:03.930]  So it is time for me to wrap up this episode.
[02:52:04.250 --> 02:52:05.490]  I want to thank everybody for joining me.
[02:52:05.490 --> 02:52:08.570]  I really appreciate you guys listening to me, especially today.
[02:52:08.770 --> 02:52:10.090]  I've got a little bit of a stuffy nose,
[02:52:10.090 --> 02:52:11.810]  so I'm sure my voice is a little bit nasally.
[02:52:11.850 --> 02:52:14.010]  So I do appreciate you for sticking through this episode.
[02:52:14.730 --> 02:52:16.050]  Thanks for listening to all the news.
[02:52:16.330 --> 02:52:18.730]  I will be back on Monday with another episode for you.
[02:52:18.770 --> 02:52:21.410]  I'm putting together the CBD episode I've been talking about.
[02:52:21.770 --> 02:52:24.530]  I'm putting together three or four episodes. They're all here in this notebook.
[02:52:25.410 --> 02:52:28.330]  Of course, now we're going to talk about integrated pest management in future
[02:52:28.330 --> 02:52:31.450]  episodes. So look forward to that. Hey guys, I'm going to wrap it up.
[02:52:32.570 --> 02:52:34.410]  What do I say at the end of the show? Oh yeah.
[02:52:34.410 --> 02:52:36.850]  That part about going to iTunes, going to the iTunes store,
[02:52:36.850 --> 02:52:40.570]  search for grow from your heart podcast and give me a five-star rating and type
[02:52:40.570 --> 02:52:43.690]  in review and let me know what you think of the show. That would be really cool.
[02:52:43.690 --> 02:52:46.130]  The more people that give the show a rating and a good review,
[02:52:46.410 --> 02:52:48.890]  the more people see the show, the more people see the show,
[02:52:49.330 --> 02:52:51.090]  more people start growing better cannabis,
[02:52:51.130 --> 02:52:52.890]  the more people that are growing better cannabis,
[02:52:52.930 --> 02:52:55.730]  which means the more quality cannabis is available,
[02:52:55.770 --> 02:52:58.530]  which means weed will get cheaper and it's just a good thing.
[02:52:58.570 --> 02:53:00.490]  Everyone will be able to smoke cheaper. Cannabis.
[02:53:00.490 --> 02:53:03.170]  We'll all have an abundance of weed. We can overgrow the government.
[02:53:03.290 --> 02:53:06.890]  So just share the show. Go click like on it. Give me a comment.
[02:53:07.010 --> 02:53:09.690]  Let me know what you think. More people will see it. More people will listen.
[02:53:09.930 --> 02:53:12.370]  And then maybe one day you'll be somewhere and somebody will smoke some weed
[02:53:12.370 --> 02:53:13.930]  with you and you'd be like, where'd you learn to grow this?
[02:53:13.930 --> 02:53:16.210]  And I'd be like, I listened to that podcast. And then you'd be like, damn,
[02:53:16.210 --> 02:53:18.530]  me too. And then everyone will have great weed because of the show.
[02:53:18.690 --> 02:53:22.170]  It'll be awesome. All right, you guys, I'm rambling. I'm running out of breath.
[02:53:22.330 --> 02:53:25.610]  Um, make sure you find me on all the social media sites. I would love all that.

[02:53:52.770 --> 02:53:54.770]  What you doing?
[02:54:42.740 --> 02:54:45.420]  Most I know we've all seen,
[02:54:45.660 --> 02:54:50.660]  but leave a snap to destroy all things for the sake of the children and future
[02:54:51.660 --> 02:54:52.500]  days.
[02:55:01.460 --> 02:55:02.080]  Youth,

[02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:08.620]  demi-nerdy
[02:55:14.460 --> 02:55:15.420]  destruction for the children.
[02:55:44.760 --> 02:55:45.340]  Wish you
[02:55:48.070 --> 02:55:48.730]  again,
[02:55:49.550 --> 02:55:51.550]  When the people are fighting
[02:55:51.550 --> 02:55:54.550]  And no more war in the streets again
[02:55:54.550 --> 02:55:57.550]  One today when every nation united
[02:55:57.550 --> 02:56:00.550]  And no more war in the streets again
[02:56:00.550 --> 02:56:03.550]  There'll be no war in the children, no destruction for the children
[02:56:03.550 --> 02:56:11.550]  Oh Jah, we need you now more than ever
[02:56:11.550 --> 02:56:17.550]  Say, oh Jah, we need you now more than ever

[02:56:21.950 --> 02:56:24.950]  Oh, God you learn
[02:56:24.950 --> 02:56:29.950]  Too much blood I run
[02:56:29.950 --> 02:56:32.950]  What we doing for the youth, let me pray for the youth
[02:56:32.950 --> 02:56:36.950]  Let's give our youth more love for the youth
[02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:44.930]  What we doing for the youth, let me pray for the youth
[02:56:44.930 --> 02:56:48.930]  Let's give our youth more love for the youth
[02:56:48.930 --> 02:57:22.030]  Too much blood I run
