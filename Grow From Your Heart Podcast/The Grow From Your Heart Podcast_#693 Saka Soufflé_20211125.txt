[02:03.290 --> 02:04.890]  Saka Souffle and The Machine.
[02:04.890 --> 02:08.690]  All right, I don't want to ramble too much here at the beginning of the show.
[02:08.690 --> 02:10.610]  May already be too late for that.
[02:10.610 --> 02:12.970]  Let's talk about Saka Souffle.
[02:12.970 --> 02:15.890]  I like to start my strange features by talking about the parents.
[02:15.890 --> 02:17.250]  That only makes sense.
[02:17.250 --> 02:21.210]  The parents of Saka Souffle are Biscotti and Arise.
[02:21.210 --> 02:24.930]  It is a female Biscotti plant and an Arise male.
[02:24.930 --> 02:30.330]  In this episode and every episode when I talk about my Arise male, I will say Arise
[02:30.330 --> 02:33.030]  and King Solomon interchangeably.
[02:33.030 --> 02:34.770]  They will mean the same thing.
[02:34.770 --> 02:38.650]  King Solomon is a specially selected Arise plant.
[02:38.650 --> 02:40.810]  He's just an Arise F1 male.
[02:40.810 --> 02:42.410]  He's my favorite male in my lineup.
[02:42.410 --> 02:46.050]  He's one of the best male plants I've ever used and worked with.
[02:46.050 --> 02:48.010]  I have named him King Solomon.
[02:48.010 --> 02:51.810]  If you read about King Solomon, you may understand why I chose that name.
[02:51.810 --> 02:52.810]  That's not important.
[02:53.290 --> 02:57.370]  The important part is knowing that Arise and King Solomon are the same thing.
[02:57.370 --> 03:00.730]  When I say male Arise and King Solomon, same dude, same guy.
[03:00.730 --> 03:01.730]  He's got two names.
[03:01.730 --> 03:02.730]  I call him Sully.
[03:02.730 --> 03:04.410]  I call him Saul.
[03:04.410 --> 03:06.810]  That's King Solomon or just Solomon.
[03:06.810 --> 03:07.810]  That's the Arise male.
[03:07.810 --> 03:09.370]  That's who I'm talking about.
[03:09.370 --> 03:14.210]  Another note, when I list genetics, I always list ladies first.
[03:14.210 --> 03:20.730]  When you hear me say Biscotti to Arise or whatever to whatever, Girl Scout Cookies to
[03:20.890 --> 03:27.890]  Grateful Dog or Banana Cush to Cherry Widow, I'm always listing ladies first.
[03:29.210 --> 03:32.850]  The one that I say second is the pollen donor.
[03:32.850 --> 03:38.010]  I'm saying pollen donor at this time because sometimes that is a reversed cross and it
[03:38.010 --> 03:39.450]  is a feminized plant.
[03:39.450 --> 03:41.010]  It was a female that gave us pollen.
[03:41.010 --> 03:43.690]  It wasn't truly a male, but it was the pollen donor.
[03:43.690 --> 03:48.330]  I'm going to say that it always is the pollen receiver to the pollen donor first.
[03:48.370 --> 03:51.010]  The easy way to remember that is ladies first.
[03:51.010 --> 03:55.410]  When I'm talking about crosses, when I say right now Biscotti to Arise, I do mean the
[03:55.410 --> 03:58.610]  Biscotti was the lady in this cross.
[03:58.610 --> 04:00.570]  I said I was going to try to not ramble.
[04:00.570 --> 04:02.250]  Already too late for that.
[04:02.250 --> 04:04.490]  The cross is Biscotti to Arise.
[04:04.490 --> 04:06.090]  Let's talk about the Biscotti.
[04:06.090 --> 04:11.330]  To the best of my research, there were differing results on the internet.
[04:11.330 --> 04:13.210]  I saw a couple of different things.
[04:13.210 --> 04:17.930]  To the best of my research, what made the most sense to me from the research online,
[04:17.930 --> 04:23.170]  the flavors, aromas, growth experience with this plant, I'm going to agree that I believe
[04:23.170 --> 04:28.030]  it is gelato, Girl Scout cookies, and South Florida OG.
[04:28.030 --> 04:32.250]  If you've got any varying information or better or different information and you would like
[04:32.250 --> 04:35.770]  to have a friendly conversation about it, if you come at me like a dick, I'm going to
[04:35.770 --> 04:37.570]  delete your email to be honest with you.
[04:37.570 --> 04:41.570]  If you're cool and calm and collected and friendly and want to have a conversation,
[04:41.570 --> 04:44.810]  my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[04:44.810 --> 04:46.370]  Let me know what you believe the cross is.
[04:46.410 --> 04:48.050]  I'm open to those friendly conversations.
[04:48.050 --> 04:50.570]  I enjoy and appreciate that sort of stuff.
[04:50.570 --> 04:53.010]  Let me get back on track here.
[04:53.010 --> 04:55.210]  I really enjoyed the Biscotti.
[04:55.210 --> 04:57.730]  The Biscotti came from a friend of mine.
[04:57.730 --> 04:58.730]  He grew it from seed.
[04:58.730 --> 04:59.730]  He made the selection.
[04:59.730 --> 05:00.730]  He found a great cut.
[05:00.730 --> 05:01.730]  I really liked it.
[05:01.730 --> 05:02.730]  He really liked it.
[05:02.730 --> 05:04.610]  He gave me a cut.
[05:04.610 --> 05:09.690]  It smelled so good and the flowers, when I smoked the flowers, it made me super mellow.
[05:09.690 --> 05:14.450]  It gave me that, we can't say Girl Scout cookies anymore, but from here out, Girl Scout cookies
[05:14.530 --> 05:17.090]  means, or GSC means Girl Scout cookies.
[05:17.090 --> 05:22.570]  It gave me that GSC buzz, but it grew so much better than the GSC and it gave me more of
[05:22.570 --> 05:23.570]  an open buzz.
[05:23.570 --> 05:26.890]  GSC or the cookies, I'll call it, kind of put me in a bubble.
[05:26.890 --> 05:27.890]  It seemed to shut me down.
[05:27.890 --> 05:30.210]  It put me in my own zone.
[05:30.210 --> 05:31.370]  I was not very social.
[05:31.370 --> 05:37.250]  I wanted to grab a guitar, grab a drum, write something, be creative, search the internet,
[05:37.250 --> 05:38.410]  scroll my phone.
[05:38.410 --> 05:41.250]  That's what GSC or cookies kind of did to me.
[05:41.250 --> 05:46.430]  The biscotti had that punch to the face from the cookies, but also kind of made me want
[05:46.430 --> 05:47.430]  to be more social.
[05:47.430 --> 05:50.730]  It made me want to talk and didn't put me in my own silent bubble.
[05:50.730 --> 05:55.050]  It was better for being social, better for being outdoors and active and in the public,
[05:55.050 --> 05:56.890]  which I often have to be over here on a podcast.
[05:56.890 --> 05:58.290]  Imagine just being in your bubble here.
[05:58.290 --> 05:59.290]  That'd be hard to do.
[05:59.290 --> 06:00.850]  I really enjoyed the buzz.
[06:00.850 --> 06:05.170]  It didn't shut me down as much and it seems to grow better than the original cookies that
[06:05.170 --> 06:07.850]  seems to be crossed with it, but it had a lot of cookies traits.
[06:08.210 --> 06:10.890]  It was like just turbo cookies, better cookies.
[06:10.890 --> 06:15.610]  I enjoy that because I really liked the cookies back in the day.
[06:15.610 --> 06:16.810]  That is the biscotti.
[06:16.810 --> 06:20.410]  It was a gelato, Girl Scout cookies, South Florida OG.
[06:20.410 --> 06:22.290]  Smelled good, really dense flowers.
[06:22.290 --> 06:24.130]  Kind of made me mellow, but not too mellow.
[06:24.130 --> 06:27.930]  Similar to cookies, better grower, but a more outgoing social buzz.
[06:27.930 --> 06:30.490]  Now, let's talk about the Arise.
[06:30.490 --> 06:34.670]  I said before that when I talk about King Solomon and Arise, it is the same plant.
[06:34.710 --> 06:40.950]  It is an F1 Arise that was specially selected and he is named King Solomon.
[06:40.950 --> 06:41.950]  Let's talk about that.
[06:41.950 --> 06:46.170]  That is a golden goat female pollinated by a daybreaker male.
[06:46.170 --> 06:50.190]  That golden goat's got that tropical sweet kind of flavors.
[06:50.190 --> 06:55.870]  It grows with kind of an indica structure, but sativa traits and it's got a very sativa
[06:55.870 --> 06:57.070]  dominant head buzz.
[06:57.070 --> 06:59.550]  It kind of gets to your brain and makes your head spin.
[06:59.550 --> 07:04.470]  I think that golden goat mixes in with everything that I cross from the Arise.
[07:04.470 --> 07:05.910]  That really adds to the potency.
[07:05.910 --> 07:08.070]  That is the golden goat doing the potency.
[07:08.070 --> 07:11.690]  On the other side of that cross, we've got the daybreaker.
[07:11.690 --> 07:13.750]  That is Chem D and Joseph OG.
[07:13.750 --> 07:16.870]  So you've got chem and kush flavors and aromas.
[07:16.870 --> 07:20.430]  That plant had big, wide fat leaves that you could camp under.
[07:20.430 --> 07:21.510]  You could live under those leaves.
[07:21.510 --> 07:23.350]  They were so big.
[07:23.350 --> 07:27.150]  It had that funky, earthy, kushy, gassy, chemical sort of smell.
[07:27.150 --> 07:31.710]  I bred the golden goat, that sweet tropical to that gassy, kushy thing, and that gave
[07:31.710 --> 07:33.430]  us Arise.
[07:33.430 --> 07:37.670]  All of those plants grow with what I call hyper vigor and great potency.
[07:37.670 --> 07:41.950]  So when you cross the Arise to anything, that hyper vigor and potency comes along.
[07:41.950 --> 07:44.890]  That's why I breed almost everything to King Solomon.
[07:44.890 --> 07:46.830]  You see everything crossed to Solomon.
[07:46.830 --> 07:50.930]  I cross a lot of stuff to eject the ripper male and I do a lot of reversals, but Solomon
[07:50.930 --> 07:52.990]  is my most used male.
[07:52.990 --> 07:54.890]  That's why I've selected Solomon for this cross.
[07:54.890 --> 07:56.990]  That's why he was bred to the biscotti.
[07:56.990 --> 08:00.790]  Let's talk a little bit about how these plants grow, the original plants, the parent plants
[08:00.790 --> 08:06.030]  that will lead us into a little bit about how the offspring are expected to grow.
[08:06.030 --> 08:10.710]  The biscotti grows fairly quickly and it got fairly tall in the garden quite early.
[08:10.710 --> 08:13.990]  I would have to pop it, twist it, bend it over, manipulate it some way because it would
[08:13.990 --> 08:19.990]  take off, but that was a good thing because I like those vigorous, fast growing plants.
[08:19.990 --> 08:25.230]  Some of the phenotypes would make long branches and it would always make gigantic tops.
[08:25.230 --> 08:30.470]  Every branch, every top on the plant of the biscotti was just dense rock hard nuggets
[08:30.470 --> 08:31.590]  with beautiful colorings.
[08:31.590 --> 08:32.590]  It would make pinks.
[08:32.590 --> 08:36.310]  It would go from light greens to pinks and then it would fade into like burgundies and
[08:36.310 --> 08:40.470]  stuff like that, but the top cola would always just be a big, it would look like a baseball
[08:40.470 --> 08:42.430]  bat no matter how big the plant was.
[08:42.430 --> 08:45.790]  We're just kicking out baseball bats out of that one.
[08:45.790 --> 08:47.310]  Where was I now?
[08:47.310 --> 08:51.950]  The golden, the Arise, I mentioned before the Arise, it grows with hyper vigor, super
[08:51.950 --> 08:52.950]  quick grower.
[08:53.350 --> 08:57.030]  It is super resistant to mold, super resistant to bugs.
[08:57.030 --> 08:59.550]  It passes on that super potency trait.
[08:59.550 --> 09:01.670]  So that is the Arise and the biscotti.
[09:01.670 --> 09:03.270]  Why did I make it?
[09:03.270 --> 09:08.430]  The buds from the biscotti were great and the buzz was super nice, but I say that Arise
[09:08.430 --> 09:09.790]  fixes everything.
[09:09.790 --> 09:13.790]  There was really nothing wrong with the biscotti, but if you could have your favorite thing
[09:13.790 --> 09:17.290]  and make it better, just make it turbocharge everything, why not?
[09:17.290 --> 09:18.290]  It's the new world.
[09:18.290 --> 09:21.990]  We want everything stronger, faster, louder right now.
[09:22.030 --> 09:23.950]  Maybe we could do that if we pollinated it with the Arise.
[09:23.950 --> 09:25.470]  I know that Arise is the champ.
[09:25.470 --> 09:28.350]  So I hit it with my King Solomon pollen.
[09:28.350 --> 09:32.510]  King Solomon pollen could be a tongue twister if you try to say it too many times.
[09:32.510 --> 09:36.590]  So I crossed those and it made a strain that I call Saka Souffle.
[09:36.590 --> 09:40.670]  Now this gets us to something that a lot of people have been asking about and a lot of
[09:40.670 --> 09:42.750]  people also understand.
[09:42.750 --> 09:44.790]  What the hell does Saka Souffle mean?
[09:44.790 --> 09:46.230]  Where did you come up with this name?
[09:46.230 --> 09:47.790]  What is this?
[09:47.790 --> 09:51.830]  If you know me at all, if you've been following me on social media for a while, if you've
[09:51.830 --> 09:56.030]  been watching the podcast, if you know me personally, you know that I am a huge fan
[09:56.030 --> 09:57.030]  of comedy.
[09:57.030 --> 09:58.030]  I love laughter.
[09:58.030 --> 09:59.030]  I love standup comedy.
[09:59.030 --> 10:00.030]  I love comedy podcasts.
[10:00.030 --> 10:01.710]  I love comedy videos.
[10:01.710 --> 10:04.830]  I think that life kind of beats us down all day.
[10:04.830 --> 10:08.910]  If you got a life bar like in a video game, when the boss yells at you, you get a couple
[10:08.910 --> 10:09.910]  of damage points.
[10:09.910 --> 10:13.590]  When the cops get behind you and make you nervous, your damage bar starts flashing and
[10:13.590 --> 10:15.270]  getting all weird.
[10:15.270 --> 10:19.910]  I think that comedy and music, a lot of it is comedy, a lot of it is music in two different
[10:19.910 --> 10:20.910]  ways.
[10:20.990 --> 10:23.310]  It's like you refill your damage bar, your energy bar, your life bar.
[10:23.310 --> 10:24.950]  It makes life better again.
[10:24.950 --> 10:26.030]  It's like kissing the boo-boos.
[10:26.030 --> 10:28.390]  You get told some good jokes and you just feel better.
[10:28.390 --> 10:30.790]  It's like soup on a sick day.
[10:30.790 --> 10:31.790]  So I really love comedy.
[10:31.790 --> 10:32.790]  I'm rambling about comedy now.
[10:32.790 --> 10:33.790]  I could do that all day.
[10:33.790 --> 10:35.310]  I'm a huge fan of standup comedy.
[10:35.310 --> 10:37.910]  The last episode I put out was about The Machine.
[10:37.910 --> 10:40.590]  That of course was named after Bert Kreischer.
[10:40.590 --> 10:46.230]  So this Saka Souffle was named kind of after a combination of another one of my favorite
[10:46.230 --> 10:49.590]  comedians, Tom Segura, also Larry King.
[10:49.590 --> 10:52.070]  So let me tell the story of how this name came up.
[10:52.070 --> 10:55.270]  Tom Segura, one of my favorite comedians, was on Larry King Live.
[10:55.270 --> 10:56.270]  Big up to Larry King.
[10:56.270 --> 10:57.270]  Rest in peace, right?
[10:57.270 --> 10:59.510]  Yeah, rest in peace, Larry King.
[10:59.510 --> 11:06.270]  Larry King asked Tom Segura one of his guilty pleasures and Tom Segura innocently answered,
[11:06.270 --> 11:08.310]  chocolate souffle.
[11:08.310 --> 11:13.310]  Now Larry King at the time was about 132 years old and he squinted and looked confused and
[11:13.310 --> 11:15.750]  said Saka Souffle.
[11:15.750 --> 11:17.110]  And it was funny.
[11:17.110 --> 11:19.590]  And that is where Saka Souffle came from.
[11:19.590 --> 11:22.350]  I kind of took that soundbite and made it a strange name.
[11:22.350 --> 11:25.070]  It became very popular on Your Mom's House podcast.
[11:25.070 --> 11:27.830]  That is the name of the show, Your Mom's House podcast.
[11:27.830 --> 11:32.110]  That is where Tom Segura and Christina Pazinski do their thing.
[11:32.110 --> 11:33.470]  Shout out to both of them.
[11:33.470 --> 11:34.470]  Hi and tight.
[11:34.470 --> 11:35.470]  What up, jeans?
[11:35.470 --> 11:38.550]  But if you're into weird, if you're broken like me, you would enjoy that podcast.
[11:38.550 --> 11:39.550]  Weird, great humor.
[11:39.550 --> 11:40.550]  Check them out.
[11:40.550 --> 11:42.510]  But that is where Saka Souffle came from.
[11:42.510 --> 11:44.670]  That clip became real popular on their show.
[11:44.670 --> 11:46.790]  I watched that show a lot.
[11:47.470 --> 11:52.270]  My friends and I would just say Saka Souffle when somebody was just doing something outlandish.
[11:52.270 --> 11:56.110]  Or if there wasn't the right thing to say at the right time, I just go Saka Souffle.
[11:56.110 --> 11:57.350]  And it just fills gaps.
[11:57.350 --> 11:58.350]  It was great.
[11:58.350 --> 12:01.110]  So Saka Souffle became a strange name.
[12:01.110 --> 12:03.350]  I said I wasn't going to ramble too much on that.
[12:03.350 --> 12:04.670]  I've done that already.
[12:04.670 --> 12:06.510]  Now let's talk about growing.
[12:06.510 --> 12:08.390]  Big up to Tom Segura also.
[12:08.390 --> 12:11.230]  Let's talk about growing some Saka Souffle.
[12:11.230 --> 12:16.590]  The dark leaves of Saka Souffle are going to take between 60 and 70 days to flower.
[12:16.590 --> 12:21.630]  The darker black leaf phenotype finishes in 63 days.
[12:21.630 --> 12:25.870]  There will be a phenotype that pops up that is kind of short and kind of squat.
[12:25.870 --> 12:29.070]  And it makes dark, dark leaves very easy.
[12:29.070 --> 12:30.830]  You probably aren't messing it up.
[12:30.830 --> 12:34.030]  It'll look like you're having a problem, like you're struggling in your grow.
[12:34.030 --> 12:38.710]  That is a trait of this plant that comes from the, we're not allowed to say Girl Scout cookies
[12:38.710 --> 12:39.710]  anymore.
[12:39.710 --> 12:41.550]  We have to say cookies or GSC.
[12:41.550 --> 12:45.390]  The Girl Scout cookies got mad that somebody made a strain called Girl Scout cookies.
[12:45.390 --> 12:47.670]  Now we have to say GSC cookies.
[12:47.670 --> 12:49.390]  I'll say random things.
[12:49.390 --> 12:51.790]  Culturally, it's cookies, GSC.
[12:51.790 --> 12:55.310]  I'll say those when I'm talking about Girl Scout cookies, just know that.
[12:55.310 --> 12:58.590]  But the Girl Scout cookies would turn black back in the day.
[12:58.590 --> 13:01.150]  There was a hashtag on social media, social media.
[13:01.150 --> 13:02.790]  I'm not sure what I said the first time.
[13:02.790 --> 13:08.270]  There was a hashtag on social media that said hashtag black leaf society.
[13:08.350 --> 13:12.990]  And that was because a lot of the Girl Scout cookies, the cookies, the cookies crosses
[13:12.990 --> 13:17.430]  plants, were changing black leaf colors in mid to late flower.
[13:17.430 --> 13:22.510]  If you see a phenotype where the petioles are turning really dark purple really quickly
[13:22.510 --> 13:26.230]  and the leaves fade to black, you're probably not messing it up.
[13:26.230 --> 13:29.110]  That is probably the plant that is just what these plants do.
[13:29.110 --> 13:34.190]  So that black leaf phenotype does finish at 63 days.
[13:34.190 --> 13:38.550]  The lighter colored plants do take approximately 70 days.
[13:38.550 --> 13:43.910]  It kind of seems like the darker, the shorter finishing and the lighter plants are the longer
[13:43.910 --> 13:44.910]  finishing.
[13:44.910 --> 13:47.870]  So the lighter color, it could be a nutrient thing also, but if you're growing them right
[13:47.870 --> 13:51.270]  and feeding them properly, the lighter colored plants are going to take a little bit longer
[13:51.270 --> 13:53.230]  with this cross.
[13:53.230 --> 13:55.390]  Let's talk about the aromas and flavors.
[13:55.390 --> 14:02.510]  I really, really enjoy the funky gross aromas and flavors that come from the Saka Souffle.
[14:02.510 --> 14:05.830]  It starts off with that peppery cookie dough thing.
[14:05.830 --> 14:09.350]  And I know that sounds weird, but imagine if you took one of those store-bought logs
[14:09.350 --> 14:13.910]  of cookie dough and just sprinkled just a hint of black pepper in it and it warmed it
[14:13.910 --> 14:14.910]  up.
[14:14.910 --> 14:16.990]  It's got a warm cookie dough with pepper sort of a smell.
[14:16.990 --> 14:19.590]  And I really, really do enjoy that.
[14:19.590 --> 14:25.910]  It's got pastries, sugary pastries, maybe some sort of scones or maybe the bakery aisle
[14:25.910 --> 14:27.550]  at the store, maybe just a bakery.
[14:27.550 --> 14:29.390]  It's got that sort of smell.
[14:29.390 --> 14:36.150]  Also, there are some phenotypes that present a cough syrup sort of a smell and also a bubble
[14:36.150 --> 14:39.630]  gum sort of a candy flavored sort of a smell.
[14:39.630 --> 14:42.470]  Also there's one that mixes that.
[14:42.470 --> 14:47.230]  Remember when you were little, sometimes they gave us a pink cough syrup that was almost
[14:47.230 --> 14:50.150]  good, almost gross at the same time.
[14:50.150 --> 14:54.950]  Some of the phenotypes reminded me of that good gross pink cough syrup.
[14:54.950 --> 14:59.670]  So there's a lot of pastry, peppery candy flavored, then there's a bubble gum, and then
[14:59.670 --> 15:03.990]  there's a cough syrup, funky flavor that does appear.
[15:03.990 --> 15:07.030]  Lots of great aromas and flavors, but those are what the flavors I think you can expect.
[15:07.030 --> 15:08.510]  There are more, but I'm going to stop there.
[15:08.510 --> 15:11.010]  I can confuse you and give you too many descriptors.
[15:11.010 --> 15:12.350]  That's a bad habit of mine.
[15:12.350 --> 15:17.510]  So expect cookie dough, pastries, cough syrup, and some bubble gum phenotypes.
[15:17.510 --> 15:23.470]  I've noticed that the lighter colors are more prone, have more potential for the bubble
[15:23.470 --> 15:24.470]  gum phenotypes.
[15:24.990 --> 15:28.350]  So those dark colored plants aren't going to have the bubble gum in most cases is what
[15:28.350 --> 15:29.550]  I've noticed.
[15:29.550 --> 15:34.830]  Now let's talk a little bit about the growth, shape, and structure of these plants.
[15:34.830 --> 15:40.030]  These plants are, they make really tight buds and most of the phenotypes make a big baseball
[15:40.030 --> 15:41.430]  bat type center bud.
[15:41.430 --> 15:46.350]  No matter how you train it, trim it, top it, that middle bud with the center stalk, that
[15:46.350 --> 15:49.990]  thing likes to grow a big fat chunky bud.
[15:49.990 --> 15:54.710]  You can almost always expect impressive top colas from these plants.
[15:54.710 --> 15:57.070]  Some of the phenotypes only grow a top cola.
[15:57.070 --> 16:01.110]  If you are a screen or a sea of green type grower, the kind of grower that just puts
[16:01.110 --> 16:05.550]  a bunch of plants like small plants in one table or one tray, packs them in real tight,
[16:05.550 --> 16:07.470]  just wants one tall branch.
[16:07.470 --> 16:10.390]  There's a phenotype in this line that does do that for you.
[16:10.390 --> 16:13.470]  If you're looking for that one cola, I call it the spear.
[16:13.470 --> 16:16.510]  It just makes one big rock all the way up.
[16:16.510 --> 16:17.510]  It is beautiful.
[16:17.510 --> 16:18.670]  That is a good cash drop.
[16:18.670 --> 16:20.790]  There's another one that is more kind of bushy.
[16:20.790 --> 16:25.710]  It grows kind of even and it doesn't get that super top cola and it grows real even without
[16:25.710 --> 16:26.710]  topping it.
[16:26.710 --> 16:29.150]  It's kind of bushy, makes that menorah effect.
[16:29.150 --> 16:33.310]  And then there's another one that does the, it gets kind of bushy, but it doesn't, it
[16:33.310 --> 16:36.950]  gets real tall and the branches get real long, but it doesn't go out real wide.
[16:36.950 --> 16:38.550]  It stays real and real skinny.
[16:38.550 --> 16:42.790]  So you got one that kind of branches out, gets bushy, doesn't make a top, one that is
[16:42.790 --> 16:47.030]  just tops and then one that is a top with branches trying to keep up basically.
[16:47.030 --> 16:50.590]  Those are the three dominant phenotypes that I, phenotypical categories.
[16:50.590 --> 16:53.430]  I'm going to say categories because you're going to see differences.
[16:53.430 --> 16:54.430]  You're going to see outliers.
[16:54.430 --> 16:55.430]  These are F1s.
[16:55.430 --> 16:56.630]  It's an F1 cross.
[16:56.630 --> 17:01.150]  You're going to see variation, but that one big spear is a common phenotype.
[17:01.150 --> 17:04.430]  That menorah type branchy one is a very common phenotype.
[17:04.430 --> 17:08.310]  And that one that just gets tall and lanky with a bunch of chasers, that is a very common
[17:08.310 --> 17:09.310]  phenotype.
[17:09.310 --> 17:14.590]  That one that gets tall and has all the chasers, every bud along the side and along the bottom
[17:14.590 --> 17:19.190]  will rock up and be silver and shiny and covered in trichomes.
[17:19.190 --> 17:21.390]  Even the bottoms on these plants are amazing.
[17:21.390 --> 17:26.510]  That one that's just a tall spear all the way down, usable, harvestable product.
[17:26.510 --> 17:29.110]  That one that's bushy and spreads out, that's a great plant.
[17:29.110 --> 17:32.370]  That's kind of like a classic plant that'll grow very well and give you everything you're
[17:32.370 --> 17:34.150]  expecting and looking for.
[17:34.150 --> 17:37.310]  That one may change colors on you a little more quickly.
[17:37.310 --> 17:38.790]  And it'll get a little bit woody as well.
[17:38.790 --> 17:43.190]  If you got that more branchy spread out phenotype, that's you're going to get more colors, possibly
[17:43.310 --> 17:46.670]  some woodier type responses from the branches.
[17:46.670 --> 17:48.950]  Let's talk more about some specifics.
[17:48.950 --> 17:51.910]  These plants are kind of slow growers.
[17:51.910 --> 17:55.870]  A lot of my plants are known for hyper vigor and they grow very quickly in veg.
[17:55.870 --> 18:00.690]  I've noticed that these don't grow as quickly in veg, but the minute you put them in flower,
[18:00.690 --> 18:02.770]  they make up for all of the lost time.
[18:02.770 --> 18:05.790]  They just go shebang, kapow, they take off.
[18:05.790 --> 18:10.910]  These plants have the potential and opportunity to triple in size from when you put them in
[18:10.910 --> 18:11.910]  flower.
[18:12.150 --> 18:18.230]  One foot tall when you put the plant in flower, expect it to get up to three feet tall by
[18:18.230 --> 18:19.910]  the time it is flowering.
[18:19.910 --> 18:22.730]  Allow proper light space, allow proper ceiling space.
[18:22.730 --> 18:24.950]  These plants have the potential to triple in size.
[18:24.950 --> 18:26.910]  I'm going to say that again, triple.
[18:26.910 --> 18:28.830]  Three times the size from when you flower.
[18:28.830 --> 18:31.990]  That can get out of control for some growers, so be prepared for that.
[18:31.990 --> 18:36.270]  If you're running a Scrognett, if you're bending, popping, twisting, that will help you out.
[18:36.270 --> 18:40.550]  If you've got that tall, stretchy pheno that makes the stretchy branches, that bad bitch
[18:40.590 --> 18:44.830]  is going to triple in size before it is done, so be ready for that.
[18:44.830 --> 18:46.710]  What else do we have to mention?
[18:46.710 --> 18:51.870]  The straight spear, that one big cola, the bush, the rocks, oh, the black leaves.
[18:51.870 --> 18:56.550]  If you are getting black leaves, I probably said this already, that is not your fault.
[18:56.550 --> 19:00.310]  That is probably just the phenotype from that plant.
[19:00.310 --> 19:02.270]  That even bushier phenotype is great.
[19:02.270 --> 19:06.110]  That thing will put out great product that smells great, looks beautiful.
[19:06.110 --> 19:08.790]  The node spacing is super tight.
[19:09.430 --> 19:13.430]  It's not the super easiest plant to grow, but the smoke from that one is my favorite.
[19:13.430 --> 19:16.190]  The bushier phenotype is my favorite to smoke.
[19:16.190 --> 19:20.670]  All right, now I'm going to talk about the buzz that I experience when I smoke Saka Souffle.
[19:20.670 --> 19:22.070]  This is what I got from it.
[19:22.070 --> 19:25.790]  I feel like Saka Souffle is the kind of herb that you could roll up a big fat joint and
[19:25.790 --> 19:26.790]  smoke it on the way to work.
[19:26.790 --> 19:30.830]  When you get to work, you clock in, and by the time you clock out, you don't even know.
[19:30.830 --> 19:32.490]  You just had a long, hard day at work.
[19:32.490 --> 19:35.630]  It's like just get shit done weed, but you don't even know it.
[19:35.630 --> 19:39.550]  You're so in this tunnel vision thing, but you're still uppity and peppity, so you could
[19:39.550 --> 19:41.710]  deal with customers if you got a social job.
[19:41.710 --> 19:44.870]  I think it would be great work weed if you had to go deal with people, deal with the
[19:44.870 --> 19:45.870]  public.
[19:45.870 --> 19:47.790]  If you're not into the public, it would be good herb.
[19:47.790 --> 19:51.750]  If you like to smoke and then go out in public and go do your stuff, this would be great
[19:51.750 --> 19:52.950]  for that because it gives you that.
[19:52.950 --> 19:56.870]  It just gives you a little bit of a pep, but it also gives you that super high kind of
[19:56.870 --> 19:57.870]  thing.
[19:57.870 --> 20:00.590]  Sometimes when you get too high, you get too much into your bubble.
[20:00.590 --> 20:03.670]  This one doesn't put you into that little private bubble.
[20:03.670 --> 20:06.070]  It doesn't give you the blinders that they put on the horses.
[20:06.070 --> 20:09.350]  Some of the herb I breed will give you the blinders and give you a panic attack.
[20:09.350 --> 20:12.430]  This one doesn't give you too much of that, but it does put you in the bubble.
[20:12.430 --> 20:16.670]  One thing I did notice was every time I smoked it, it kind of got me above and behind my
[20:16.670 --> 20:17.670]  eyes.
[20:17.670 --> 20:19.630]  It felt like my hat was too tight.
[20:19.630 --> 20:21.590]  It almost felt like I was wearing a headband.
[20:21.590 --> 20:24.830]  There's already a strain called headband, but it did feel like I had my headphones were
[20:24.830 --> 20:25.830]  too tight.
[20:25.830 --> 20:28.950]  I kept feeling pressure or something around my face.
[20:28.950 --> 20:31.510]  I noticed it, and I enjoyed it.
[20:31.510 --> 20:32.510]  It gets me in the eyes.
[20:32.510 --> 20:36.630]  It gets me in that bubble, but I'm also still functional, which is a good thing for me because
[20:36.630 --> 20:37.990]  people like to talk to me.
[20:37.990 --> 20:42.990]  People expect me to be functional and doing shit, so I can't be too roasted all the time.
[20:42.990 --> 20:48.590]  I've noticed that the phenotypes, they get the purple petioles, the long purple leaves.
[20:48.590 --> 20:53.190]  Those are going to give you more of that tunnel vision sort of a buzz sort of a thing.
[20:53.190 --> 20:56.790]  Now let's work into that part of the paper where I always write tips and tricks.
[20:56.790 --> 21:01.110]  I've already mentioned that this plant is a slow grower, but it does explode in flower.
[21:01.190 --> 21:03.790]  I wrote again, triple in size.
[21:03.790 --> 21:06.670]  Some of the phenotypes of these plants will triple in size.
[21:06.670 --> 21:07.670]  Be prepared.
[21:07.670 --> 21:08.670]  You've been forewarned.
[21:08.670 --> 21:10.430]  Where do we go from there?
[21:10.430 --> 21:14.630]  Fat, dense nugs, even the lowers get dense and frosty.
[21:14.630 --> 21:18.110]  If you don't have your environment dialed in, you may want to pop and twist and bend
[21:18.110 --> 21:22.310]  and top these plants and create a bunch of smaller bud sites instead of just one big
[21:22.310 --> 21:23.430]  gigantic bud site.
[21:23.430 --> 21:28.350]  If you lay it on its side, those smaller buds will grow up and you don't get one big giant
[21:28.350 --> 21:29.350]  dense bat.
[21:29.350 --> 21:31.070]  You get a row of smaller buds.
[21:31.070 --> 21:34.870]  If you tip that big branch on its side, it may help you out with mold issues, but you're
[21:34.870 --> 21:36.210]  going to get big buds.
[21:36.210 --> 21:37.870]  So be prepared.
[21:37.870 --> 21:39.910]  Get your environment dialed in.
[21:39.910 --> 21:44.350]  These plants, some of the phenotypes I mentioned, I may have mentioned that the bushier phenotypes
[21:44.350 --> 21:47.670]  will get a little bit woody later in their life.
[21:47.670 --> 21:50.470]  Pop and twist them early because you don't want them to explode.
[21:50.470 --> 21:53.870]  Some of the woody phenotypes will get a little bit crunchy.
[21:53.870 --> 21:54.870]  They're going to get big.
[21:54.870 --> 21:56.830]  They're going to need some sort of support.
[21:56.830 --> 22:00.910]  Even those single bud phenotypes, they may enjoy some support.
[22:00.910 --> 22:02.030]  They may help you out.
[22:02.030 --> 22:06.390]  If you just put down a screen and put one bud per screen or just put one stick per bud,
[22:06.390 --> 22:07.790]  that would help you out.
[22:07.790 --> 22:11.690]  The tall stretchy one is definitely going to need some sort of supports.
[22:11.690 --> 22:14.270]  The light green phenotypes are more bendy.
[22:14.270 --> 22:16.510]  They're easier to work into a trellis, into a canopy.
[22:16.510 --> 22:17.510]  They're more pliable.
[22:17.510 --> 22:20.950]  Once they start getting a little bit purple, they do get kind of woody.
[22:20.950 --> 22:21.950]  They do kind of snap.
[22:21.950 --> 22:24.470]  You'll break off leaves and branches much more easily.
[22:24.470 --> 22:26.910]  So be careful with those purple phenotypes.
[22:26.910 --> 22:28.430]  That is not a nutrient deficiency.
[22:28.430 --> 22:29.690]  That's not a problem.
[22:29.690 --> 22:33.090]  That is just something in the genetics that does happen.
[22:33.090 --> 22:36.370]  Pop and twist those gently because you don't want those to explode.
[22:36.370 --> 22:37.370]  Top them early.
[22:37.370 --> 22:41.050]  Let them branch out to prevent that giant cola at the end.
[22:41.050 --> 22:43.250]  Purple stems and purple and dark colors is common.
[22:43.250 --> 22:46.330]  I keep saying that, but that is in my notes a lot.
[22:46.330 --> 22:47.930]  It fades hard in late.
[22:47.930 --> 22:49.050]  Blooming looks sad.
[22:49.050 --> 22:50.050]  It's okay.
[22:50.050 --> 22:51.050]  It just does that.
[22:51.050 --> 22:54.050]  It looks like a phosphorus or a potassium deficiency.
[22:54.050 --> 22:55.810]  It's just done.
[22:55.810 --> 22:58.010]  Sometimes that purple stalk finishes up.
[22:58.010 --> 22:59.130]  It's not a nutrient issue.
[22:59.570 --> 23:04.290]  What I wrote down was sometimes the plant itself looks like it's done before the trichomes
[23:04.290 --> 23:05.290]  are ripe.
[23:05.290 --> 23:06.410]  Just let the plant keep going.
[23:06.410 --> 23:08.130]  The trichomes will ripen up.
[23:08.130 --> 23:11.650]  Even if those leaves are black and turn in gold and yellow, let it keep going.
[23:11.650 --> 23:15.250]  There will be some very beautiful photo opportunities.
[23:15.250 --> 23:16.250]  There's not a problem.
[23:16.250 --> 23:17.250]  It's just done.
[23:17.250 --> 23:19.210]  That plant is entering what is called senescence.
[23:19.210 --> 23:20.410]  It's like, dude, I've done my life.
[23:20.410 --> 23:22.050]  I'm only supposed to live a year.
[23:22.050 --> 23:24.490]  I'm only supposed to flower for so long.
[23:24.490 --> 23:27.290]  It had its whole goal was to get pollinated.
[23:27.330 --> 23:30.650]  All of its organs to receive pollen have now receded and dried up.
[23:30.650 --> 23:31.650]  That plant is done.
[23:31.650 --> 23:32.650]  It's in senescence.
[23:32.650 --> 23:33.650]  It's over.
[23:33.650 --> 23:34.810]  It's waiting for its time to die.
[23:34.810 --> 23:36.530]  It's just waiting for you to cut it down.
[23:36.530 --> 23:38.810]  But until you do, those trichomes will keep ripening.
[23:38.810 --> 23:39.930]  So let it keep going.
[23:39.930 --> 23:41.690]  Don't cut it down too early.
[23:41.690 --> 23:42.690]  Let it finish.
[23:42.690 --> 23:45.050]  That trait, again, does come from the GSC.
[23:45.050 --> 23:49.810]  I'm not sure what trait in the GSC, what line from that came from, what parent, but that
[23:49.810 --> 23:51.730]  is a trait from the GSC.
[23:51.730 --> 23:55.330]  Anyone who grew the cookies back in the day, we saw it turn different colors.
[23:55.330 --> 23:56.330]  We got it black.
[23:56.370 --> 23:57.370]  We got it purple.
[23:57.370 --> 24:00.930]  Environmental factors and pushing it, nutrients would change these plants so many different
[24:00.930 --> 24:01.930]  colors.
[24:01.930 --> 24:05.850]  Eventually, you just realize that when you dial it in, it will change a lot of cool colors.
[24:05.850 --> 24:07.930]  It's not anything we're doing wrong.
[24:07.930 --> 24:11.690]  Don't try to overfeed it to correct a nutrient issue.
[24:11.690 --> 24:12.690]  That's when you mess it up.
[24:12.690 --> 24:15.530]  It'll start doing ... Usually, it'll stack up and make a good bud.
[24:15.530 --> 24:18.610]  If you overfeed it, it'll do what I call the spiral staircase.
[24:18.610 --> 24:23.570]  You get the main stalk and then right up that stem, you get a bud here and then a bud here
[24:23.570 --> 24:24.570]  and a bud here.
[24:24.570 --> 24:25.730]  It doesn't fill in like it's supposed to.
[24:26.130 --> 24:28.050]  If you feed it properly, that'll all fill in.
[24:28.050 --> 24:32.530]  It'll be one giant cola that fills up that whole marrow stem, just be one chunky baseball
[24:32.530 --> 24:34.330]  bat worth of nuggets.
[24:34.330 --> 24:37.130]  Where else do I have to go from there?
[24:37.130 --> 24:40.250]  These plants handle spider mites very well.
[24:40.250 --> 24:45.090]  We had one tester get hit with regular spider mites and these plants didn't get touched.
[24:45.090 --> 24:47.610]  We had another tester get hit with the worst of all.
[24:47.610 --> 24:51.570]  He got the russets and he said these plants fared the best in the room.
[24:51.570 --> 24:55.290]  I'm not going to call anybody out for their russets, but good work for recovering from
[24:55.370 --> 24:56.370]  that.
[24:56.370 --> 24:59.330]  They finished the harvest of this plant with russets and made it to the end.
[24:59.330 --> 25:00.330]  That's a big challenge.
[25:00.330 --> 25:03.130]  All right, my final notes on this one.
[25:03.130 --> 25:07.490]  I've got to expect big buds, so have airflow and VPD dialed in.
[25:07.490 --> 25:12.450]  Possibly water less to reduce humidity and to prevent issues.
[25:12.450 --> 25:15.930]  If you're watering less, you're going to have less water in the room.
[25:15.930 --> 25:18.610]  Defoliate, that will reduce transpiration.
[25:18.610 --> 25:20.210]  These plants don't make a lot of leaves.
[25:20.210 --> 25:22.050]  They're super easy to trim.
[25:22.050 --> 25:25.170]  Pull off a lot of those big leaves with the long purple petioles.
[25:25.170 --> 25:28.050]  That'll make less air in the room, less transpiration.
[25:28.050 --> 25:31.210]  You won't have as much water in the room just because of that.
[25:31.210 --> 25:34.470]  These plants don't really like cold at all.
[25:34.470 --> 25:37.090]  They get purple and they stop growing.
[25:37.090 --> 25:39.250]  I had some plants on a cold floor.
[25:39.250 --> 25:40.250]  They just stopped.
[25:40.250 --> 25:42.550]  We had another person report their room got cold.
[25:42.550 --> 25:43.550]  They just stopped.
[25:43.550 --> 25:47.690]  Don't get them, excuse me, don't get them extremely cold.
[25:47.690 --> 25:50.330]  Basic diurnal temperature swings will be okay.
[25:50.330 --> 25:52.850]  They're five, seven, maybe 10 degree swings.
[25:52.850 --> 25:53.970]  Don't get them cold at night.
[25:53.970 --> 25:54.970]  They'll stop growing.
[25:54.970 --> 25:55.970]  They'll turn purple.
[25:55.970 --> 25:57.730]  The buds just turned into these black rocks.
[25:57.730 --> 25:58.730]  They don't do anything.
[25:58.730 --> 26:00.050]  They freeze up on you.
[26:00.050 --> 26:01.050]  Don't do that.
[26:01.050 --> 26:05.770]  They do not like being over watered and they especially don't like cold water.
[26:05.770 --> 26:08.250]  No plants really do enjoy the cold water.
[26:08.250 --> 26:10.330]  They're slightly challenging to grow.
[26:10.330 --> 26:15.090]  The problem is they're supposed to change colors and do weird shit and new growers see
[26:15.090 --> 26:18.970]  those colors and see the differences that these plants do and they panic and freak out
[26:18.970 --> 26:20.530]  and try to fix it.
[26:20.530 --> 26:23.930]  Grow it just like any other plant and it will work just like any other plant.
[26:23.930 --> 26:27.250]  If you don't fuck it up and freak it out, it won't fuck up and freak out.
[26:27.250 --> 26:29.690]  It's supposed to change colors and do weird shit.
[26:29.690 --> 26:30.690]  That's part of the plant.
[26:30.690 --> 26:32.050]  I'm trying to find my pages in order.
[26:32.050 --> 26:33.330]  There we go.
[26:33.330 --> 26:37.830]  The next thing is they like low pH and medium nutrients in flower.
[26:37.830 --> 26:39.810]  Too much nitrogen will make it do the bud spin.
[26:39.810 --> 26:42.470]  I talked about that spiral staircase a moment ago.
[26:42.470 --> 26:45.930]  Too much nitrogen will definitely attribute to the spiral staircase.
[26:45.930 --> 26:47.610]  Now I did say low pH.
[26:47.610 --> 26:50.690]  A lot of the time I recommend about 6.2 to 6.4.
[26:50.690 --> 26:52.770]  Stick around that 6.1, 6.2.
[26:52.770 --> 26:55.930]  I've seen these plants grow very well in low, low pH.
[26:55.930 --> 26:58.730]  I've seen them go 5.8 and thrive.
[26:58.730 --> 27:02.010]  You'll make the dark plants really dark, really purple.
[27:02.010 --> 27:05.890]  Low pH and lots of kelp I think will bring out a lot of stank.
[27:05.890 --> 27:06.890]  That yeah, stank.
[27:06.890 --> 27:08.490]  Not just stink, it's stank.
[27:08.490 --> 27:09.490]  All right.
[27:09.490 --> 27:10.490]  Where am I going from there?
[27:10.490 --> 27:13.010]  I've got another, I've got one last page.
[27:13.010 --> 27:14.770]  I do apologize for the throat clearing.
[27:14.850 --> 27:18.370]  I'm not even sure that I'm going to edit that out because I'm on such a good flow.
[27:18.370 --> 27:22.050]  The best grows were in soil or soilless mixes.
[27:22.050 --> 27:25.090]  This plant didn't seem to like hydro as much as the soilless mixes.
[27:25.090 --> 27:30.450]  However, the hydro guys did kill it, but the soilless and organic guys were crushing it.
[27:30.450 --> 27:35.730]  If I were going to grow Sacca Souffle, I would probably grow it four seven gallon pots under
[27:35.730 --> 27:37.090]  a thousand watt light.
[27:37.090 --> 27:41.290]  I would veg it until it reached the scrognet and then I would put it into flower and for
[27:41.290 --> 27:44.010]  the first two weeks work it into that scrognet.
[27:44.010 --> 27:45.650]  Then it'll take off and keep growing.
[27:45.650 --> 27:49.570]  I may put up another net to support those big buds, but that's probably how I would
[27:49.570 --> 27:50.650]  do it.
[27:50.650 --> 27:56.290]  Or I would find that phenotype that shoots one main cola and I would do in a five by
[27:56.290 --> 28:01.010]  five I'd probably do, depending on numbers, if you add unlimited numbers, probably go
[28:01.010 --> 28:06.610]  with 16 of those in a five by five, veg them until they're about a foot and a half tall,
[28:06.610 --> 28:09.410]  then flip them and they'll be ready to go.
[28:09.410 --> 28:11.090]  That's what I would probably do.
[28:11.090 --> 28:14.810]  It looks like there's a lot of space when they grow because they get a little bit stretchy,
[28:14.810 --> 28:17.890]  but they will fill in if you don't overfeed them.
[28:17.890 --> 28:21.330]  Veggies like cookies is what I wrote down, but it takes off in bloom.
[28:21.330 --> 28:22.330]  Where are we?
[28:22.330 --> 28:26.850]  Oh, do the sea of green, find a good phenotype that makes the big cola and just cram a bunch
[28:26.850 --> 28:27.850]  of them in.
[28:27.850 --> 28:32.930]  If you're the hydro guy that grows on cubes, do the four by four table with like 64 cubes
[28:32.930 --> 28:34.550]  and veg for like a week.
[28:34.550 --> 28:37.250]  This plant would kill it with that.
[28:37.250 --> 28:41.370]  I don't know that I would recommend Saka Souffle outdoors for a lot of people, unless
[28:41.370 --> 28:42.530]  you've got a good environment.
[28:42.530 --> 28:44.190]  I said it makes giant buds.
[28:44.190 --> 28:49.410]  Those giant buds do put you at risk for problems outdoors late in the season.
[28:49.410 --> 28:54.170]  This year we saw a lot of people with bud rot, with powdery mildew, with extreme damage
[28:54.170 --> 28:55.930]  in the middle of their buds.
[28:55.930 --> 29:00.570]  I fear that this makes such big buds, you would experience those types of problems.
[29:00.570 --> 29:04.970]  So unless you can control that, I don't know that I would recommend this outdoors.
[29:04.970 --> 29:09.590]  These plants do make a very great calyx to leaf ratio, so they are easy to trim.
[29:09.590 --> 29:14.850]  If you hate trimming and you like big fat harvest, these may be the plants for you.
[29:14.850 --> 29:16.230]  Very, very nice bag of peel.
[29:16.230 --> 29:20.870]  The buds have a silvery purple color that comes from the cookies.
[29:20.870 --> 29:22.650]  Some of them get very dark.
[29:22.650 --> 29:24.370]  The others are very bright, bright green.
[29:24.370 --> 29:26.610]  So you're going to get very good bag of peel.
[29:26.610 --> 29:29.730]  Everything will be super frosty.
[29:29.730 --> 29:31.050]  The rosin, we made rosin.
[29:31.050 --> 29:32.650]  I can't say we, I watched.
[29:32.650 --> 29:33.650]  I supervised.
[29:33.850 --> 29:35.050]  I had my hands on my hips.
[29:35.050 --> 29:38.370]  I was smelling a lot going, smells like you're doing a good job.
[29:38.370 --> 29:43.130]  Friends of mine made rosin, and the rosin that came out of the press looked like velvet.
[29:43.130 --> 29:45.170]  It had, it was silver and glittery.
[29:45.170 --> 29:47.410]  It looked like a silver sheen with speckles in it.
[29:47.410 --> 29:50.330]  It looked like they were mixing metallic paint.
[29:50.330 --> 29:52.170]  Really beautiful concentrate.
[29:52.170 --> 29:55.570]  The dab tasted like eating, oh, that camera just fucking died.
[29:55.570 --> 29:57.210]  I got to finish it on this camera.
[29:57.210 --> 29:59.090]  Got to finish up quickly.
[29:59.090 --> 30:00.410]  Tasted like eating a buttery pastry.
[30:00.410 --> 30:01.410]  You guys, I got to go quick.
[30:01.410 --> 30:03.170]  I don't want this to end.
[30:03.690 --> 30:07.130]  It's like a buttery armpits, bad armpits, or a hippie girl who works as a pastry chef.
[30:07.130 --> 30:08.130]  All right, that's what I've got.
[30:08.130 --> 30:09.850]  I'm going to wrap it up because that camera died.
[30:09.850 --> 30:11.130]  I don't want to lose this episode.
[30:11.130 --> 30:12.130]  Thank you.
[30:12.130 --> 30:13.130]  Thank you.
[30:13.130 --> 30:15.130]  Check out my website, ieregenetics.com.
[30:15.130 --> 30:17.330]  Email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[30:17.330 --> 30:18.930]  What do I have here at the end?
[30:18.930 --> 30:19.930]  Black Friday sale.
[30:19.930 --> 30:20.930]  You know how to get that.
[30:20.930 --> 30:22.370]  Shout out to my buddy, Rosin Man.
[30:22.370 --> 30:23.730]  Until next time, take a fat dab.
[30:23.730 --> 30:24.730]  Give your mom a hug from me.
[30:24.730 --> 30:26.290]  I hope I got all this on recording.
[30:26.290 --> 30:27.290]  Happy Thanksgiving, you guys.
[30:27.290 --> 30:28.290]  I love you.
[30:28.730 --> 30:29.730]  And I'll see you guys next time.
[30:29.730 --> 30:30.730]  Bye.
[30:30.730 --> 30:31.730]  Happy Thanksgiving.
[30:31.730 --> 30:32.730]  Happy Thanksgiving.
[30:32.730 --> 30:33.730]  Happy Thanksgiving.
[30:33.730 --> 30:34.730]  Happy Thanksgiving.
