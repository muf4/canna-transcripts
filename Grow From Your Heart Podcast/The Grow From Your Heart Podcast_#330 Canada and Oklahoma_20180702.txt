[00:14.850 --> 00:19.090]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious

[00:54.070 --> 00:55.070]  Welcome back, internet world.
[00:55.070 --> 00:57.850]  It's time for episode 330 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:57.850 --> 01:01.030]  Thanks again for joining me, sitting across the table from me.
[01:01.030 --> 01:02.030]  Welcome back to the show.
[01:02.030 --> 01:03.030]  This is White Mike.
[01:03.030 --> 01:04.030]  Thanks for hanging out, dude.
[01:04.030 --> 01:05.030]  Yeah, man.
[01:05.030 --> 01:06.030]  Thanks for having me.
[01:06.030 --> 01:07.230]  Thanks for making some time away from the family, away from the work, and away from
[01:07.230 --> 01:09.030]  the super hot day to come hang out.
[01:09.030 --> 01:11.030]  It's nice to get out every once in a while.
[01:11.030 --> 01:13.030]  Man, it's roasting hot out there.
[01:13.030 --> 01:14.030]  Yes.
[01:14.030 --> 01:15.030]  Sorry, people.
[01:15.030 --> 01:16.750]  The weather here is fucking insane right now.
[01:16.750 --> 01:18.230]  It's got everybody acting goofy.
[01:18.230 --> 01:20.970]  It's slow and lethargic.
[01:20.970 --> 01:23.910]  It's only been hotter than this one day ever here.
[01:23.910 --> 01:24.910]  Wow.
[01:24.910 --> 01:29.590]  Yesterday, we were three degrees short of the ever record for this area.
[01:29.590 --> 01:31.990]  And then today, we hit the record forever here.
[01:31.990 --> 01:34.190]  I'm not sure how close we got today.
[01:34.190 --> 01:35.590]  It was also stupid hot.
[01:35.590 --> 01:37.310]  Yeah, it's ridiculously hot here.
[01:37.310 --> 01:38.910]  We'll quit bitching about the weather.
[01:38.910 --> 01:39.910]  Let's do a podcast.
[01:39.910 --> 01:40.910]  Mike is here.
[01:40.910 --> 01:41.910]  I am here.
[01:41.910 --> 01:42.990]  We're going to do a good show for you.
[01:42.990 --> 01:46.190]  Before we get too far, this podcast is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[01:46.190 --> 01:47.190]  Company.
[01:47.190 --> 01:48.190]  That's right.
[01:48.190 --> 01:50.910]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella
[01:50.910 --> 01:51.910]  Dank Seed Company.
[01:51.910 --> 01:54.370]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:54.370 --> 01:57.470]  The Hella Dank Seed Company is doing a 4th of July sale.
[01:57.470 --> 01:58.470]  That's right.
[01:58.470 --> 02:03.190]  And then, 3rd through July 5th, if you use coupon code IRE20, you will get 20% off your
[02:03.190 --> 02:04.190]  whole order.
[02:04.190 --> 02:09.030]  Also, rumor has it, there will be a fresh drop of new IRE genetics.
[02:09.030 --> 02:10.590]  So make sure you check out dankseed.store.
[02:10.590 --> 02:11.590]  All right.
[02:11.590 --> 02:14.070]  We got the advertising out of the way.
[02:14.070 --> 02:16.910]  The next step is to talk about what we are smoking on.
[02:16.910 --> 02:18.550]  Mike, how are you feeling over there?
[02:18.550 --> 02:20.310]  Baked like a cake.
[02:20.310 --> 02:21.310]  Baked like a cake.
[02:21.310 --> 02:22.670]  We were smoking this on the last episode.
[02:22.670 --> 02:23.670]  You guys were in love with it.
[02:23.670 --> 02:24.670]  I'm in love with it.
[02:24.670 --> 02:28.390]  It is the sinful banana sauce from Contraband Concentrates.
[02:28.430 --> 02:33.910]  Contraband is the in-house concentrate company at a cut above dispensary in Colorado Springs.
[02:33.910 --> 02:38.030]  The sinful banana sauce comes in at 87.8% THCA.
[02:38.030 --> 02:42.210]  It is a cross of cinnamon, cookies, and honey bananas.
[02:42.210 --> 02:43.510]  And this stuff is delicious.
[02:43.510 --> 02:44.510]  I approve.
[02:44.510 --> 02:48.070]  It tastes really good, but the other one hit me substantially harder.
[02:48.070 --> 02:49.910]  I'm reaching for that one now to talk about that.
[02:49.910 --> 02:53.930]  That is the Durban Kush sauce from the same company, the same place.
[02:53.930 --> 03:03.930]  This one tested at 90.3% THCA, but it's also got 2.1% THC added to the label there.
[03:03.930 --> 03:07.290]  The other one didn't have that listed, so that might be what's giving you that extra
[03:07.290 --> 03:08.290]  punch.
[03:08.290 --> 03:09.290]  I don't know.
[03:09.290 --> 03:10.290]  The other one doesn't have any of that stuff listed.
[03:10.290 --> 03:11.290]  It's blank there.
[03:11.290 --> 03:13.850]  So maybe that's what's giving you the extra.
[03:13.850 --> 03:14.850]  I don't know.
[03:14.850 --> 03:15.850]  That should be listed on the other container.
[03:15.850 --> 03:17.370]  Honestly, that doesn't make any sense to me.
[03:17.370 --> 03:20.090]  But yeah, the Durban Kush.
[03:20.090 --> 03:23.210]  This one's got that anise and licorice.
[03:23.210 --> 03:24.570]  It's got a super Durban-y smell to it.
[03:24.570 --> 03:25.570]  I'm going to pop it open.
[03:25.570 --> 03:28.970]  It doesn't have that pine end to it, but it's very Durban-y.
[03:28.970 --> 03:31.810]  It seems like the Kush took out that pine end.
[03:31.810 --> 03:36.130]  It's got sort of a sweet end to it, like a candy sort of a thing.
[03:36.130 --> 03:38.650]  And look at the crystals in that one, bro.
[03:38.650 --> 03:39.930]  Big old chunky crystals in there.
[03:39.930 --> 03:40.930]  My dad was really pretty.
[03:40.930 --> 03:42.930]  Yeah, Mike's dad was more than a meter.
[03:42.930 --> 03:43.930]  Like a train.
[03:43.930 --> 03:44.930]  Yeah, it kind of ran him over.
[03:44.930 --> 03:46.690]  He had to go catch his breath, go have a cigarette.
[03:46.690 --> 03:50.610]  I've been fiddling with this pen like it's holding me, drowning to the world, guys.
[03:51.010 --> 03:53.010]  The only thing keeping you here in reality.
[03:53.010 --> 03:55.290]  All right, well, welcome back to Earth, Mike.
[03:55.290 --> 03:59.930]  Let's do a podcast about legalization.
[03:59.930 --> 04:00.930]  Legalize it.
[04:00.930 --> 04:02.450]  Let's start here close to home first.
[04:02.450 --> 04:03.450]  Big shout out to Oklahoma.
[04:03.450 --> 04:04.450]  Way to go, Oklahoma.
[04:04.450 --> 04:05.450]  Way to go.
[04:05.450 --> 04:06.450]  You guys are legal now.
[04:06.450 --> 04:11.570]  Just, I think it was Mike said two years ago, you guys were trying to sue us for having
[04:11.570 --> 04:13.570]  cannabis and now you are-
[04:13.570 --> 04:20.410]  In 2014, Oklahoma was part of a lawsuit suing Colorado for our audacity to legalize marijuana.
[04:21.210 --> 04:28.810]  I think this week, last week, Oklahoma legalized medical, a more liberal legalization or medical
[04:28.810 --> 04:32.250]  law than any state since California.
[04:32.250 --> 04:34.330]  There's not a list of qualifying conditions.
[04:34.330 --> 04:39.490]  A doctor can sign a recommendation for any condition he sees fit, he or she sees fit to.
[04:39.490 --> 04:40.490]  That's pretty cool.
[04:40.490 --> 04:43.090]  So if they just say, yeah, you can have it, dude.
[04:43.090 --> 04:44.090]  Yes or no.
[04:44.090 --> 04:45.090]  There you go.
[04:45.090 --> 04:47.890]  Yeah, and on top of that, they can have three ounces in public.
[04:47.890 --> 04:48.890]  Wow.
[04:48.890 --> 04:49.890]  Yep.
[04:50.370 --> 04:51.370]  That's pretty cool.
[04:51.370 --> 04:54.690]  We can only have as a recreational patient, you can carry two as a, or as a rec patient,
[04:54.690 --> 04:55.690]  you can carry one.
[04:55.690 --> 04:56.970]  As a medical patient, you can carry two.
[04:56.970 --> 04:58.850]  So that's a little different there.
[04:58.850 --> 05:02.130]  You guys, I just realized in the headphones, you may be able to hear my air conditioning.
[05:02.130 --> 05:04.810]  It's a little clicky, floppy, jingly sound in the background.
[05:04.810 --> 05:07.170]  I'm trying to filter that out with some compression here.
[05:07.170 --> 05:09.410]  It's a, it's 104 degrees.
[05:09.410 --> 05:12.210]  You guys, you're going to have to just let me have a little air conditioning in the background
[05:12.210 --> 05:14.710]  today, but we'll try not to complain too much.
[05:14.710 --> 05:18.170]  It's after nine o'clock at night and it's still over 90 degrees outside here.
[05:18.170 --> 05:19.170]  We ain't used to this shit.
[05:19.450 --> 05:20.450]  Yeah, I got it up on high.
[05:20.450 --> 05:21.450]  Still.
[05:21.450 --> 05:23.410]  I just reached down to turn up the compressor on the audio equipment.
[05:23.410 --> 05:25.330]  I was like, no, that's pretty much where it goes.
[05:25.330 --> 05:27.450]  It's not going to, if it goes any higher, we're going to start cutting out.
[05:27.450 --> 05:29.210]  That's why you hear our voices get short.
[05:29.210 --> 05:30.570]  Sometimes the end of the words don't finish.
[05:30.570 --> 05:33.610]  It's going to get the compressor up, but we're just going to have to deal with that sound
[05:33.610 --> 05:34.770]  of that air in here a little bit.
[05:34.770 --> 05:36.570]  Cause it is high, you guys.
[05:36.570 --> 05:40.730]  So Oklahoma, welcome to the medical marijuana club.
[05:40.730 --> 05:43.930]  You don't have to have any qualifying conditions to go get your medical cannabis.
[05:43.930 --> 05:47.010]  As long as the doctor there feels like you can do it, you can do it.
[05:47.250 --> 05:52.010]  So you guys that are listening to this show, my friends, my friend, my friends, you have
[05:52.010 --> 05:53.130]  got a headstart.
[05:53.130 --> 05:54.250]  You've got an education.
[05:54.250 --> 05:58.650]  You've got basically kind of a course in how to go.
[05:58.650 --> 05:59.770]  Listening for a while.
[05:59.770 --> 06:02.730]  You've got a big jump on most of the other people in your state.
[06:02.730 --> 06:03.730]  Yeah.
[06:03.730 --> 06:06.050]  Go, go be a part of this new revolution.
[06:06.050 --> 06:11.970]  Go be a grower, go be a trimmer, go be a grow tech, go be an extraction coordinator.
[06:11.970 --> 06:15.050]  There are so many different positions to fill in that industry.
[06:15.090 --> 06:19.330]  And if you don't want to be involved with the packaging, labeling, marketing, sales,
[06:19.330 --> 06:23.810]  distribution, so much of that also security, I was going to say there are going to be
[06:23.810 --> 06:25.450]  ancillary businesses that pop up.
[06:25.450 --> 06:26.690]  You're going to get smoke shop.
[06:26.690 --> 06:31.930]  If you've got another business, like if you're a contractor or a tradesman, HVAC tech,
[06:31.930 --> 06:32.930]  start thinking that way.
[06:32.930 --> 06:33.250]  Yeah.
[06:33.250 --> 06:35.130]  HVAC techs, electricians.
[06:35.130 --> 06:36.130]  Yep.
[06:36.370 --> 06:37.170]  You're going to need somebody.
[06:37.170 --> 06:39.690]  They're going to need somebody that can drive a forklift in their new facilities.
[06:39.890 --> 06:41.890]  But what I'm saying is go get in there and get a head start.
[06:42.090 --> 06:46.210]  And also, if you're not going to be involved in the weed industry, maybe open a head shop.
[06:46.210 --> 06:50.490]  So many head shops are going to pop up, open up a grow store, open up all of the things
[06:50.490 --> 06:51.450]  that go along with it.
[06:51.450 --> 06:53.570]  Lodging, because now more people are going to be coming there.
[06:53.570 --> 06:54.450]  What's medical marijuana?
[06:54.450 --> 06:55.330]  It's not recreational.
[06:55.850 --> 06:59.650]  So it's not going to have as much impact as it did here because people come here to buy
[06:59.650 --> 06:59.730]  it.
[07:00.170 --> 07:05.090]  Let's put container places, places that make containers for the product.
[07:05.290 --> 07:10.530]  When we go to the conventions here, a good portion of all of the booths are simply
[07:10.930 --> 07:14.450]  medical approved containers that we can retail our products.
[07:14.450 --> 07:16.930]  And so maybe have a container company.
[07:17.370 --> 07:21.010]  Um, they're going to need representatives for their companies that will drive around
[07:21.010 --> 07:22.650]  up and down the state or your square.
[07:22.650 --> 07:27.170]  So all over the state and call Russia's one highway, you go up and down all day long and
[07:27.170 --> 07:28.810]  you go sell products up and down that highway.
[07:28.810 --> 07:29.010]  But.
[07:29.490 --> 07:32.410]  Uh, you're going to want to drive around your state and represent your brand.
[07:32.410 --> 07:34.530]  Maybe that's your niche, but find your way in there.
[07:34.530 --> 07:37.810]  If not in the industry itself, in an ancillary business, if you're not
[07:38.250 --> 07:41.170]  a comfortable or allowed to get in that industry, maybe you just want to be on the
[07:41.170 --> 07:42.570]  fringe, get an ancillary business.
[07:42.570 --> 07:43.330]  That's a part of it.
[07:43.850 --> 07:47.370]  Uh, there are a lot of things that will be involved with cannabis becoming legal.
[07:47.370 --> 07:49.370]  Mike, you got some more notes over there about Oklahoma?
[07:49.810 --> 07:51.290]  Um, not especially.
[07:51.810 --> 07:52.170]  Okay.
[07:52.410 --> 07:55.810]  I, uh, I wanted to get a little more in depth, but I did not.
[07:55.810 --> 07:58.810]  I'm saving some of the commentary for, uh, after we do Canada.
[07:59.210 --> 08:00.290]  For after we do Canada.
[08:00.330 --> 08:02.130]  Well then that's a good segue, I guess.
[08:02.130 --> 08:05.570]  There's a lot that apply that I want to say that applies to both locales.
[08:06.570 --> 08:10.890]  But, uh, Canada legalized y'all Canada's going legit.
[08:10.930 --> 08:11.210]  Yes.
[08:11.210 --> 08:14.330]  They talked about it a long time ago and now they are doing it.
[08:14.330 --> 08:16.810]  Canada has legalized cannabis.
[08:16.850 --> 08:22.370]  It was a campaign promise, um, that they carried through on and on October 17th.
[08:23.090 --> 08:25.810]  Um, marijuana will be legal across the country.
[08:26.610 --> 08:31.330]  Um, it's split up into Providence's just let her provinces, just like the
[08:31.530 --> 08:36.650]  us is split up into States and just like the U S every province is going to have
[08:36.650 --> 08:37.490]  their own laws.
[08:37.490 --> 08:38.650]  It looks like completely.
[08:39.450 --> 08:44.490]  Um, I've got some outline of some of the basic E rules, but, uh, it looks like
[08:44.490 --> 08:48.450]  it's going to vary pretty heavily from one part of Canada to the next.
[08:49.210 --> 08:54.330]  Um, state run stores in one part, a couple hundred stores that are privately
[08:54.330 --> 08:59.810]  owned and another no stores in another, um, some areas allow commercial growth.
[08:59.810 --> 09:02.530]  Some areas don't some areas allow home grows.
[09:02.530 --> 09:03.490]  Some areas don't.
[09:04.290 --> 09:09.770]  Um, some legalized for everybody when they turn 18 Alberta in Quebec, it'll be
[09:09.770 --> 09:15.850]  legal once you turn 18, all other provinces, it won't be legal until you're 19.
[09:16.570 --> 09:20.930]  I know the anti-pot groups are just shocked that they didn't go with 21.
[09:20.930 --> 09:21.530]  Like we did.
[09:21.610 --> 09:21.970]  Right.
[09:22.530 --> 09:22.890]  Right.
[09:23.210 --> 09:26.210]  And 18 and 19 is weird to have two different ages, because what if you are
[09:26.210 --> 09:29.770]  19 and you have your weed and you drive across state lines, like, Oh shit,
[09:29.770 --> 09:31.210]  I got to throw my weed out the window now.
[09:31.570 --> 09:31.770]  Yep.
[09:31.850 --> 09:32.490]  Like, yeah.
[09:32.570 --> 09:33.610]  I just can't take it with you there.
[09:33.610 --> 09:36.570]  I guess that's, we have similar problems here, but that's so weird.
[09:37.010 --> 09:38.250]  Like just an age difference.
[09:38.410 --> 09:38.650]  Yep.
[09:38.730 --> 09:40.290]  Four plants per household.
[09:40.290 --> 09:42.610]  It looks like, but it depends again on your area.
[09:43.490 --> 09:48.410]  Um, Quebec and Manitoba specifically have already banned home grows
[09:48.410 --> 09:50.290]  completely, like all forms of home grow.
[09:50.370 --> 09:50.810]  Oh wow.
[09:51.410 --> 09:51.570]  Yep.
[09:51.650 --> 09:54.210]  Canada's got an interesting cannabis history.
[09:54.850 --> 09:58.290]  They basically went through what Pueblo is going through now, or ours part of
[09:58.290 --> 10:00.770]  Colorado is going through now with all the illegal home grows.
[10:01.130 --> 10:02.570]  They did that in the early thousands.
[10:02.570 --> 10:02.810]  Yeah.
[10:02.850 --> 10:03.010]  Yeah.
[10:03.010 --> 10:04.890]  We learned a lot of what we know from Canada.
[10:05.130 --> 10:09.890]  A lot of people remember, uh, the, the ice out in Canada power went out for a
[10:09.890 --> 10:13.570]  long time in Canada and people were managing grows and that was a huge thing
[10:13.570 --> 10:15.890]  that we were paying attention to on the internet at that time.
[10:16.170 --> 10:18.850]  And then after that, a lot of things went wrong and a lot of the
[10:18.850 --> 10:20.090]  Canadian grows got in trouble.
[10:20.290 --> 10:21.610]  That's where the Romulan comes from.
[10:21.610 --> 10:22.730]  You guys is Canada.
[10:22.890 --> 10:24.610]  Romulan is a Canadian strain.
[10:25.250 --> 10:30.490]  Um, when I was in college, all of us were, or came down from Canada, but, uh,
[10:30.970 --> 10:33.530]  their history with, it's a little different than ours, their politics
[10:33.530 --> 10:34.890]  is way different than ours.
[10:34.890 --> 10:39.410]  So, um, they went about this a very different way than the U S yeah, they
[10:39.410 --> 10:39.690]  did.
[10:39.850 --> 10:40.890]  Yeah, they definitely did.
[10:41.250 --> 10:44.490]  Uh, the age difference that just automatically before it even starts,
[10:44.490 --> 10:45.970]  just no home grows in some places.
[10:45.970 --> 10:46.970]  That's pretty intense.
[10:47.370 --> 10:53.290]  Uh, they, they wanted to, the, uh, the government wanted to do this early
[10:53.290 --> 10:57.890]  summer was when they wanted to roll this out and they delayed it till October to
[10:57.890 --> 11:02.690]  give all the different little local governments a chance to weigh in and hash
[11:02.690 --> 11:05.410]  all this out and figure out how they wanted to play it.
[11:06.170 --> 11:09.250]  Um, local control was kind of a big piece of this from what I see.
[11:09.650 --> 11:12.370]  Isn't that kind of the opposite of how we do it here in the States and the
[11:12.370 --> 11:13.930]  States, we kind of say, Hey, we've got this idea.
[11:13.930 --> 11:15.170]  We're going to make these new rules.
[11:15.490 --> 11:20.970]  Um, go and then you go and then along the way they go, Oh, we didn't see that rule.
[11:20.970 --> 11:23.370]  We're going to have to dial that in and they just go make a new.
[11:23.410 --> 11:23.610]  Yeah.
[11:23.610 --> 11:24.890]  So they seem to have gotten it right.
[11:25.330 --> 11:30.170]  Even though we don't agree with everything, they did it seems to have worked better.
[11:30.450 --> 11:34.730]  Um, they have some things that I really wish we had that would make this rollout
[11:34.730 --> 11:36.650]  easier to what they have national healthcare.
[11:37.170 --> 11:37.490]  Oh yeah.
[11:37.490 --> 11:39.210]  Um, that simplifies this shit a lot.
[11:40.050 --> 11:46.130]  Um, they're known for being more, just chill, more polite.
[11:46.890 --> 11:48.610]  And that helps their politics.
[11:49.130 --> 11:52.570]  Like their politics follow suit a little bit, at least in the national media.
[11:52.570 --> 11:54.730]  I've never been in Canada for more than like 15 minutes.
[11:55.010 --> 11:59.450]  So since, uh, since the medical industry, is it going to lose business?
[11:59.770 --> 12:02.730]  Because it's not a business in Canada as much as it is here.
[12:03.330 --> 12:07.410]  Uh, they're not lobbying against marijuana as much as what you kind of said.
[12:07.610 --> 12:13.090]  Um, I haven't followed this that closely, but pretty much all the marijuana
[12:13.610 --> 12:19.170]  entities in Canada that I follow have been at least generally in support of this change.
[12:19.810 --> 12:23.970]  Um, some of the long time activists are getting really pissed right now because
[12:23.970 --> 12:27.570]  like new politicians are like, look what we did and they're like, go fuck yourself.
[12:27.570 --> 12:31.130]  We've been fighting for this for 30 years and now you're doing it in
[12:31.130 --> 12:33.050]  a way that kind of excludes us.
[12:33.850 --> 12:37.930]  Um, and so that some of those factions are starting to get a really pissed, but.
[12:38.730 --> 12:42.890]  Um, a lot of those people at the same time have been really, really, really
[12:42.890 --> 12:45.650]  pushing the envelope for a long time.
[12:45.650 --> 12:46.610]  That's how we got here.
[12:47.290 --> 12:50.570]  And I can't fault them for continuing to do what got us here.
[12:51.530 --> 12:53.730]  Like without them, we wouldn't be here.
[12:53.730 --> 12:54.930]  Colorado wouldn't be here.
[12:54.930 --> 12:56.250]  Canada wouldn't be legal.
[12:56.250 --> 13:03.330]  Oklahoma wouldn't have just gone medical, but, uh, for the most part, like just
[13:03.330 --> 13:09.330]  having a more calm political system that we're able to have discussions in an adult
[13:09.330 --> 13:10.770]  manner that we're not able to have here.
[13:11.210 --> 13:11.370]  Yeah.
[13:11.370 --> 13:14.210]  Things are, we get here automatically go to the extremes.
[13:14.250 --> 13:14.650]  Yes.
[13:14.650 --> 13:18.290]  Like when you bring up marijuana legalization, you're automatically
[13:18.290 --> 13:21.890]  talking about teenagers getting stoned and killing people on the highway.
[13:22.090 --> 13:27.250]  And raping white bitches or it causing schizophrenia or like you just
[13:27.250 --> 13:29.250]  immediately, the conversation is extreme.
[13:29.330 --> 13:31.370]  Everybody's more, we know doubt instantly.
[13:31.690 --> 13:32.190]  Yep.
[13:32.510 --> 13:35.550]  Um, there was a lot less of that.
[13:35.590 --> 13:39.350]  Pretty much the only big anti-marijuana group up there, Sam Canada.
[13:39.950 --> 13:42.350]  And they're a fucking horrible export of ours.
[13:43.390 --> 13:45.830]  They just have even less support up there than they do here.
[13:46.070 --> 13:47.230]  So they're mostly all about it.
[13:47.230 --> 13:50.310]  And Canada has been pretty, pretty relaxed on marijuana was from what I
[13:50.310 --> 13:53.270]  understand in the past anyway, for a very long time.
[13:53.270 --> 13:56.670]  We're getting beasters delivered in high school years ago, just coming down from
[13:56.670 --> 13:59.630]  Canada, just flooding it in good old Canadian weed.
[13:59.630 --> 14:01.750]  Just to get FedEx to my dorm, dude.
[14:01.790 --> 14:05.550]  Not mine, but like, that's the guy I purchased from.
[14:05.550 --> 14:07.390]  He used to get it FedEx from fucking Canada.
[14:07.390 --> 14:08.190]  And it was wonderful.
[14:08.230 --> 14:11.710]  I had friends up in Oregon and Washington that were showing up in Colorado
[14:11.710 --> 14:13.150]  with that way back in the day.
[14:14.190 --> 14:16.790]  They've been fighting a good fight for a long time.
[14:16.790 --> 14:20.790]  And it's, they're the only, the second nation to go nationally.
[14:21.550 --> 14:24.710]  Um, after Uruguay, they're going with a totally different system.
[14:24.710 --> 14:28.950]  So again, like I'm kind of cheese cause we're going to get a whole new data set.
[14:28.950 --> 14:29.450]  Now.
[14:29.790 --> 14:30.290]  Yeah.
[14:30.290 --> 14:30.790]  That's kind of fun.
[14:31.150 --> 14:34.950]  One of the upsides to the anti-pot crowd is Canada's going to have more
[14:34.950 --> 14:36.390]  data collection from the onset.
[14:36.990 --> 14:38.790]  Nobody here considered to do it.
[14:39.470 --> 14:41.950]  Like after a holiday, like St.
[14:41.950 --> 14:44.550]  Patrick's day, like by the Wednesday after St.
[14:44.550 --> 14:48.550]  Patrick's day, the newspaper has the DUI results from across the state.
[14:49.190 --> 14:51.950]  Like here, here it is broken down by County.
[14:51.950 --> 14:53.150]  There were six people in Denver.
[14:53.150 --> 14:54.390]  There were two people in Douglas.
[14:54.390 --> 14:59.030]  Like you can see it easy because it took mothers against drunk driving,
[14:59.030 --> 15:01.430]  fighting for 20 years to get that system built.
[15:01.870 --> 15:05.990]  When we legalized weed, like two years later, they were like, yeah, we
[15:05.990 --> 15:07.430]  don't have a system like that for weed.
[15:07.470 --> 15:09.350]  We don't have any idea what's going on.
[15:09.390 --> 15:10.390]  We haven't been dealing with this.
[15:10.390 --> 15:14.830]  And so just recently there's, they've started to try to collect that data.
[15:15.510 --> 15:18.670]  And it's given the anti-pop people a chance to be like, look, there's,
[15:18.910 --> 15:20.350]  there were no cases last year.
[15:20.350 --> 15:22.590]  In this case, this year, there's 900 cases.
[15:22.590 --> 15:24.150]  And it's like, well, last year they didn't look.
[15:24.310 --> 15:24.510]  Yeah.
[15:24.510 --> 15:25.590]  We didn't write it down last year.
[15:25.590 --> 15:26.790]  We didn't know there was a test on that.
[15:26.790 --> 15:28.870]  So we never took notes, but they're not going to have that
[15:28.870 --> 15:30.110]  advantage in Canada.
[15:30.150 --> 15:34.790]  And the data collection is going to be not complete, but more so there from the
[15:34.790 --> 15:36.630]  outset, which is fun for people like me.
[15:37.870 --> 15:39.230]  It's the upside of legalization.
[15:39.230 --> 15:42.870]  Like the more research that happens on it, the better an idea it becomes.
[15:42.870 --> 15:43.230]  Yes.
[15:43.230 --> 15:46.590]  And then we can see data and numbers, and then we have tangible evidence to pass on
[15:46.590 --> 15:48.150]  to the next people that are trying to do it.
[15:49.670 --> 15:56.750]  Most people don't really realize how permissive and infectious our prohibition
[15:56.750 --> 16:02.110]  laws have become over the decades, how much of American society they've infected
[16:02.110 --> 16:04.390]  and eroded and fucked up and fucked with.
[16:04.390 --> 16:11.430]  And what's what that's continued to do, what the ripples from that have done and
[16:12.070 --> 16:14.790]  undoing it in even a little way is good.
[16:14.830 --> 16:20.870]  Like earlier we did a Instagram live video and someone asked me what the worst part of
[16:20.870 --> 16:22.470]  Colorado's legalization is.
[16:22.990 --> 16:24.390]  And I couldn't think of an answer.
[16:24.870 --> 16:31.470]  Like there are parts that are more annoying than others, but there's not one single
[16:31.470 --> 16:37.750]  part of our incomplete, fucked up, over-restrictive legalization law.
[16:37.910 --> 16:41.030]  I don't prefer to its prohibition counterpart.
[16:41.510 --> 16:41.830]  All right.
[16:42.790 --> 16:43.750]  Like, do you?
[16:46.670 --> 16:47.870]  I had to make a transition.
[16:47.870 --> 16:49.470]  I came from the black market.
[16:49.550 --> 16:51.270]  Much more so than I did.
[16:51.790 --> 16:52.110]  Yeah.
[16:52.310 --> 16:52.590]  Yeah.
[16:52.790 --> 16:56.030]  So there, there was a lifestyle change that came with legalization.
[16:56.470 --> 16:59.030]  Um, when this plant was illegal.
[16:59.110 --> 17:00.150]  So that's back in the day.
[17:00.150 --> 17:01.190]  I feel like that's long enough.
[17:01.190 --> 17:02.790]  I don't feel uncomfortable saying this.
[17:03.150 --> 17:07.030]  You guys, where we live several years ago, don't be too specific.
[17:07.630 --> 17:10.110]  We'd would cost $4,000 a pound.
[17:10.630 --> 17:16.350]  Now where we live, we'd cost 1500, $1,200 a pound for the same quality.
[17:16.870 --> 17:17.190]  Yeah.
[17:17.230 --> 17:17.470]  Yeah.
[17:17.470 --> 17:18.910]  Well, yeah, just kind of, yeah.
[17:19.510 --> 17:21.110]  And there's, no one's going to buy it anyway.
[17:21.150 --> 17:22.950]  Inside the legal market.
[17:22.950 --> 17:23.750]  It's even worse.
[17:23.750 --> 17:28.150]  You places like Oregon right now, they so overproduced and they so
[17:28.150 --> 17:29.990]  restricted the distribution market.
[17:30.550 --> 17:33.670]  That the price has fallen off the floor.
[17:34.110 --> 17:38.830]  Like, well, imagine now, but legalization did the same thing to the black market.
[17:38.830 --> 17:42.350]  And that's one of the points is it's an economic weapon against the black market.
[17:42.430 --> 17:45.350]  If I were to continue trying to grow as a lifestyle, my product is
[17:45.350 --> 17:47.150]  worth a quarter of what it used to be.
[17:47.390 --> 17:49.350]  So that means I get to live a quarter of the way I used to.
[17:49.350 --> 17:51.910]  It means I get to eat a quarter of the Thai food I used to eat.
[17:52.230 --> 17:53.750]  That means I get to buy a quarter of the day.
[17:53.750 --> 17:56.190]  Or you have to do 150% more.
[17:56.390 --> 17:59.350]  Or you have to jump into the legal industry because you've got experience
[17:59.350 --> 18:01.710]  and you've got know-how and you know what to do with it and you know how to get in
[18:01.710 --> 18:05.430]  there and lead it and you know, a bunch of people, that was the way to do it, to
[18:05.430 --> 18:08.550]  be confident and go in there and crush it that way, most of the people that
[18:08.550 --> 18:10.950]  tried to just do 150% more illegal shit.
[18:10.950 --> 18:11.830]  Composted quick.
[18:11.870 --> 18:12.350]  They're gone.
[18:12.350 --> 18:12.670]  Yeah.
[18:12.790 --> 18:13.070]  Yeah.
[18:13.390 --> 18:13.750]  Yeah.
[18:14.230 --> 18:18.510]  I used to have a house decked out with lights and I got a T five and a flowering
[18:18.990 --> 18:20.190]  it is so much easier.
[18:20.950 --> 18:21.830]  Life is simpler.
[18:21.990 --> 18:22.230]  Yep.
[18:22.790 --> 18:24.310]  It's less stressful being legal.
[18:24.670 --> 18:27.750]  Well, Mike, I feel like I bombarded your, uh, your Canada report.
[18:27.750 --> 18:30.390]  You got any more notes on Canada that you want to get covered before I start
[18:30.390 --> 18:32.590]  rambling over you specifically, but.
[18:33.230 --> 18:33.470]  Okay.
[18:33.470 --> 18:37.150]  So the next piece of this, like, it's awesome that Canada's going legal now.
[18:37.590 --> 18:38.390]  And it's awesome.
[18:38.390 --> 18:44.390]  The Oklahoma one medical, but now like a lot of the nitty gritty work begins.
[18:45.030 --> 18:48.990]  If you're not already active in local government, get active.
[18:49.030 --> 18:54.110]  If you're not already following local state province, country
[18:54.110 --> 18:56.470]  news, start following it now.
[18:57.190 --> 19:01.070]  Um, otherwise you'll wake up and the legalization law will be written to
[19:01.070 --> 19:05.310]  exclude everybody, except people that can come in with several million
[19:05.310 --> 19:07.990]  dollars and open a corporation.
[19:08.670 --> 19:12.510]  Um, Colorado pushed out all the small growers because they were worried
[19:12.550 --> 19:17.110]  about small time black market grows, um, becoming legal and just kind of
[19:17.110 --> 19:20.030]  walking a fine line between legal and illegal.
[19:20.430 --> 19:25.750]  So they made you upfront invest as much as they could get away with making
[19:25.750 --> 19:29.430]  you up front invest to put that guillotine, um, around you.
[19:30.390 --> 19:34.190]  And now that all the quality is going down because it's just ran by money.
[19:34.230 --> 19:35.150]  There's no more passion.
[19:35.430 --> 19:38.590]  The, the quality took a huge hit here in Colorado.
[19:39.150 --> 19:43.350]  In generally, you can still find what I consider the best herb on the planet.
[19:44.070 --> 19:48.270]  Um, if you take your time to go to the right places and shop around and get
[19:48.270 --> 19:53.510]  what you're really looking for, but there's a lot of crap, a lot of crap
[19:53.510 --> 19:56.470]  available and it sells, unfortunately.
[19:56.990 --> 20:00.430]  It's unfortunately most people that are in this just for money.
[20:00.430 --> 20:03.590]  When they look at their bottom line, the first thing they cut is talent.
[20:04.190 --> 20:04.310]  Yeah.
[20:04.350 --> 20:05.830]  This talent costs a lot of money.
[20:05.910 --> 20:06.510]  Yes, it do.
[20:06.750 --> 20:12.230]  And they can get their cousin to do the checklist that the talent made.
[20:13.350 --> 20:17.590]  And they think it's the same thing and it's not, they find, they find out after
[20:17.590 --> 20:19.630]  a couple of crops that quickly becomes apparent.
[20:20.110 --> 20:24.550]  So we were talking about, uh, getting into getting in now, getting involved now.
[20:24.550 --> 20:25.590]  How can they do that?
[20:25.590 --> 20:27.750]  What is an easy, what's, what's the first step?
[20:27.830 --> 20:29.430]  We often tell everyone to get involved.
[20:29.430 --> 20:32.110]  Like you have a local newspaper.
[20:32.590 --> 20:38.510]  They're the, the news agency that's going to be covering zoning rules in your area,
[20:38.630 --> 20:40.510]  home grow rules in your area.
[20:41.150 --> 20:43.030]  Um, zoning for stores.
[20:43.030 --> 20:46.870]  If all that hasn't been finalized yet, they're the, um, government
[20:46.870 --> 20:48.470]  agencies making all those decisions.
[20:48.990 --> 20:54.310]  And for the most part, you can just look up the meeting time and show up.
[20:54.550 --> 20:59.430]  And if you do that a couple of times and just kind of sit back and observe, you
[20:59.470 --> 21:04.070]  can figure out what the little easy process is to go speak in front of
[21:04.070 --> 21:05.910]  that body and say whatever you want.
[21:06.630 --> 21:12.230]  Um, they've almost universally got some sort of public forum spot, um, during
[21:12.230 --> 21:15.950]  their regular meetings where you can get up there and rail about whatever
[21:15.950 --> 21:17.230]  it is you're passionate about.
[21:17.830 --> 21:24.670]  Um, and that's the easiest way to really start getting, um, their attention.
[21:25.110 --> 21:29.830]  You can also email all these people, call all these people, local elected
[21:29.830 --> 21:34.110]  officials get paid to make random people in the public happy.
[21:35.230 --> 21:40.510]  That's how they keep their job is making enough people in, in the community.
[21:40.510 --> 21:45.110]  They serve wander around and go, Hey, do you know about Bobby down at the state house?
[21:45.110 --> 21:48.070]  He's so helpful that way they keep their job.
[21:48.070 --> 21:52.630]  And so when people call them during the day, nine times out of 10, they answer.
[21:52.670 --> 21:55.270]  And it's just like, hello, I'm your local elected official.
[21:55.310 --> 21:55.830]  Who are you?
[21:55.830 --> 21:56.750]  What can I do for you?
[21:56.750 --> 21:57.750]  What can I do you for?
[21:57.790 --> 22:01.590]  And even if they disagree with you nine times out of 10, they're
[22:01.590 --> 22:02.910]  fairly polite and helpful.
[22:03.390 --> 22:04.930]  And they'll be like, well, I disagree with that.
[22:04.930 --> 22:08.850]  But if you talk to my co-count, you know, co-commissioner, so-and-so, you know, I
[22:08.850 --> 22:11.990]  think he's more receptive to this and he'll be more willing to help you get
[22:12.010 --> 22:15.670]  whatever you want done or submitted in front of our committee or council.
[22:15.750 --> 22:18.070]  So they can pass you along to the right person, at least hopefully.
[22:18.390 --> 22:23.110]  But it starts with just reading the news and following these stories and going to
[22:23.110 --> 22:24.910]  the meetings and sitting back and observing.
[22:25.750 --> 22:28.430]  And honestly, not enough people do it.
[22:29.030 --> 22:33.870]  Um, the people that go are the handful of people like me that are passionate
[22:33.870 --> 22:38.670]  about it for some weird sort of broken childhood reasons and, uh, the people
[22:38.670 --> 22:42.670]  who are my exact opposite and against it.
[22:43.390 --> 22:45.630]  And those are the people that tend to dominate the meetings.
[22:46.310 --> 22:50.510]  And I finally snapped at one meeting and was like, no, I can't let people
[22:50.510 --> 22:52.390]  who can't formulate an entire sentence.
[22:52.430 --> 22:52.750]  Yeah.
[22:53.110 --> 22:53.670]  I know who that is.
[22:53.670 --> 22:55.350]  Continue to speak for my community.
[22:55.470 --> 22:57.590]  Like he doesn't represent me at all.
[22:57.950 --> 23:00.430]  He's representing my community badly.
[23:00.990 --> 23:05.030]  Um, I can do a better job guaranteed, even as nervous as I am.
[23:05.750 --> 23:09.710]  Um, and I started getting up and speaking and it was terrifying.
[23:09.710 --> 23:13.270]  The first time I was on the front page of the local paper, like it's annoying
[23:13.270 --> 23:17.270]  as much hate I get from the anti-pop crowd down here, but it's worth it.
[23:17.750 --> 23:20.390]  Like without what I did, we wouldn't have what we have in Pueblo.
[23:20.430 --> 23:21.150]  That's very true.
[23:21.590 --> 23:26.230]  It just took me doing like, it just took one of me to get most
[23:26.230 --> 23:27.310]  of what we have in Pueblo.
[23:27.830 --> 23:31.390]  I went to several of those city council meetings and the first couple, I was
[23:31.390 --> 23:33.710]  just hanging out and attending and it was nerve wracking.
[23:34.030 --> 23:35.070]  I was just, just there.
[23:35.070 --> 23:36.030]  I wasn't even speaking.
[23:36.030 --> 23:37.030]  I wasn't doing anything.
[23:37.350 --> 23:40.270]  But after the second or third one, you get the flow, you see how it goes.
[23:40.270 --> 23:41.310]  You hear people speak.
[23:41.670 --> 23:44.270]  And then you realize that everyone that goes up and speaks is
[23:44.270 --> 23:46.110]  just a working class person.
[23:46.150 --> 23:48.430]  They just want some shit in the community to be different.
[23:48.750 --> 23:53.310]  And that's, they may be judging you because what you're asking for is cannabis
[23:53.310 --> 23:58.310]  related, but at the same time, they've got to hear you and you are their community.
[23:58.350 --> 23:59.190]  So they'll listen.
[23:59.230 --> 24:02.470]  So just go a few times, get it figured out, find out where you
[24:02.470 --> 24:04.030]  fit in and then speak one day.
[24:04.030 --> 24:06.870]  And when you speak other people that are passionate, we'll see you speak.
[24:07.310 --> 24:10.710]  And guys like myself will walk up to you and go, Hey bro, can you, uh, like teach
[24:10.750 --> 24:13.990]  me like, cause I don't want to go be involved so much because I look like this
[24:14.270 --> 24:17.390]  and I do this, but it'd be cool to have some knowledge and then you'll, you'll
[24:17.390 --> 24:20.310]  start finding like-minded folks and you'll start falling in with the right, right.
[24:20.310 --> 24:20.710]  Folks.
[24:20.710 --> 24:21.830]  And then you'll get it figured out.
[24:22.350 --> 24:26.510]  When I first started going with just watch by the fourth or fifth meeting,
[24:27.190 --> 24:30.670]  like elected officials were coming up to me after the meeting and going like, why
[24:30.670 --> 24:31.190]  are you here?
[24:32.070 --> 24:35.270]  Like not to be rude or like to encourage you not to be here.
[24:35.270 --> 24:38.190]  It's just like, you're not one of the crazies.
[24:39.350 --> 24:40.430]  You're not paid.
[24:40.590 --> 24:41.390]  You're not media.
[24:41.630 --> 24:46.630]  And you haven't gone, got like freaked out about whatever local rule or called
[24:46.630 --> 24:48.110]  us fascists or anything yet.
[24:48.590 --> 24:49.830]  So like, why are you here?
[24:50.510 --> 24:54.190]  And I just calmly, like, I'm, I've got an issue.
[24:54.310 --> 24:55.350]  Um, that's important to me.
[24:55.350 --> 24:56.870]  That's coming up in front of council.
[24:56.870 --> 25:00.030]  And I wanted to get a feel for the meetings and they're like, cool.
[25:00.990 --> 25:04.350]  Like they don't that they're interested that you're interested is all.
[25:04.430 --> 25:07.870]  Like, even if they disagree with you, they're glad you could put a coherent
[25:07.870 --> 25:08.670]  argument together.
[25:08.670 --> 25:12.830]  Because if you go to a few of these and watch, there'll be three or four crazy
[25:12.830 --> 25:19.470]  people that have the public speaking rules on lockdown and go every week to rail and
[25:19.470 --> 25:23.870]  like, um, call your local elected officials, fascists, and bitch about how they're
[25:23.870 --> 25:24.950]  taking away your rights.
[25:24.950 --> 25:26.830]  Because it's an always pothole ordinance.
[25:26.830 --> 25:31.190]  There's always one elderly person bitching about the same fucking thing for the past
[25:31.190 --> 25:31.910]  eight years in there.
[25:31.910 --> 25:32.150]  Yep.
[25:32.390 --> 25:34.390]  Um, I've had to turn my mic off.
[25:34.390 --> 25:35.430]  So you got to talk for a minute.
[25:35.430 --> 25:36.190]  Cause I'm going to do a dab.
[25:36.470 --> 25:41.630]  I've had the same really nice lady, um, come and ask me to stand up in solidarity
[25:41.630 --> 25:46.070]  when she asks me to, you know, who in the crowd wants to impeach the council with
[25:46.070 --> 25:46.310]  me?
[25:46.310 --> 25:48.750]  And she's like, I need everybody to stand up when I say that.
[25:49.270 --> 25:52.310]  And she'll go to everybody in the meeting and spend like an hour talking to people
[25:52.310 --> 25:53.470]  and then nobody will stand up.
[25:53.470 --> 25:54.910]  She's done that like a hundred times.
[25:55.710 --> 25:58.350]  Um, just go and watch.
[25:58.390 --> 26:02.950]  And when you start making a coherent argument, you can see their faces light up
[26:02.950 --> 26:06.550]  like people dying of thirst being offered water.
[26:08.070 --> 26:09.350]  Cause it's a lot of nonsense.
[26:09.350 --> 26:14.990]  And when it's not total nonsense, it's ridiculously specific legal jargon.
[26:15.830 --> 26:20.870]  Um, that gets read aloud by somebody with a voice that's designed to put people to
[26:20.870 --> 26:21.750]  sleep usually.
[26:22.310 --> 26:25.710]  And so they just latch onto whatever you're saying.
[26:25.710 --> 26:30.110]  And I was able to turn seven people who were definitely against me into five people
[26:30.110 --> 26:35.390]  that were with me in like two months of just going down and using a three minute
[26:35.390 --> 26:39.150]  window to point out economic benefits of legalization.
[26:39.750 --> 26:42.950]  And I wasn't using anything that I didn't Google.
[26:43.830 --> 26:49.070]  Um, if you're not good at asking Google the right questions, hit me up online and
[26:49.070 --> 26:49.870]  I will help you.
[26:50.670 --> 26:52.110]  Like that's really all it takes.
[26:52.790 --> 26:53.350]  How can they help?
[26:53.350 --> 26:54.310]  How can they hit you up?
[26:54.910 --> 26:58.830]  Uh, you can find me at Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws and Facebook or at
[26:58.830 --> 27:00.470]  Nemo punk 15 on Twitter.
[27:02.270 --> 27:03.070]  Nice to have buddy.
[27:03.630 --> 27:04.910]  Oh, it tastes so good.
[27:05.550 --> 27:06.870]  Was that the German or the bananas?
[27:06.910 --> 27:11.990]  That is neither green dot labs, screaming scout, full spectrum extract.
[27:12.230 --> 27:14.950]  That's gotta be something screaming and girl scout cookies.
[27:14.950 --> 27:16.310]  And it tastes so good.
[27:16.550 --> 27:16.750]  Yup.
[27:18.950 --> 27:20.790]  Or a weird Fino with a loud scout.
[27:22.110 --> 27:26.030]  I wish I'd start putting further genetic information on the label.
[27:26.150 --> 27:26.750]  Me too.
[27:26.870 --> 27:28.110]  Um, it's just shit.
[27:28.110 --> 27:29.070]  You and your boy's name.
[27:29.070 --> 27:30.190]  Feel free to write that too.
[27:30.190 --> 27:34.910]  I, I respect that more than just putting shenanigans on the side of the package.
[27:35.350 --> 27:36.870]  It's just straight sauce.
[27:36.910 --> 27:39.910]  So you're just going to get, it's like just a liquid dab is all it.
[27:39.910 --> 27:41.790]  Well, there's a little turp in there, a little diamond in there.
[27:43.150 --> 27:44.190]  Oh, this is going to kill you.
[27:44.350 --> 27:46.190]  That needs to be heated, but yeah.
[27:48.110 --> 27:49.470]  So yeah, we came to a pause in the show.
[27:49.630 --> 27:54.110]  Um, how is, how is Canada changing?
[27:55.070 --> 27:56.030]  How is it changing?
[27:56.430 --> 27:58.470]  How is this going to affect us in Colorado?
[27:58.950 --> 28:02.550]  Canada's bit when Uruguay legalized, I'll heat that for you.
[28:02.550 --> 28:07.670]  Could you, um, when you're legalized, the West went, so who?
[28:07.910 --> 28:08.230]  Yeah.
[28:08.710 --> 28:10.350]  Like cute little old man, president.
[28:10.390 --> 28:10.870]  Yay.
[28:11.310 --> 28:13.430]  Like all nine of your people have legal weed now.
[28:13.430 --> 28:14.030]  Good for you.
[28:14.430 --> 28:16.270]  Like that's literally how the West reacted.
[28:16.310 --> 28:19.510]  And there were a couple of anti-pop people that were like, this will not
[28:19.510 --> 28:21.510]  stand the UN convention of 19.
[28:22.350 --> 28:25.590]  Um, but for the most part, no one gave a fuck.
[28:26.430 --> 28:31.150]  Um, but Canada's major, they're a major us trading partner.
[28:31.150 --> 28:32.910]  We share a huge border.
[28:33.590 --> 28:36.350]  Um, they're in all the summits.
[28:36.510 --> 28:39.910]  Uh, they participate in all the international committees.
[28:40.350 --> 28:42.590]  They're one of our major partners in everything.
[28:43.470 --> 28:49.910]  Um, this impacts a lot and stuff that it doesn't directly impact.
[28:49.950 --> 28:53.310]  They're going to provide us all the data that we need for legalization.
[28:53.430 --> 28:56.430]  Um, Colorado's doing that, but it's harder to find.
[28:57.190 --> 29:00.990]  Uh, I have a feeling that Canada is going to be really upfront and loud and proud
[29:00.990 --> 29:05.070]  about this because they've got universal healthcare, they can track some shit.
[29:05.070 --> 29:05.510]  We can't.
[29:05.750 --> 29:06.150]  All right.
[29:06.550 --> 29:08.070]  Um, a little better.
[29:08.430 --> 29:14.870]  And, um, a lot of like, that's what I'm really looking forward to about Canada's
[29:14.870 --> 29:15.510]  legalization.
[29:15.510 --> 29:16.790]  Like I've got legalization here.
[29:16.790 --> 29:18.150]  I don't need to travel to enjoy it.
[29:18.510 --> 29:18.750]  Right.
[29:18.750 --> 29:20.590]  Y'all want to give me a killer job in Canada.
[29:20.590 --> 29:21.670]  I'm willing to get a green card.
[29:21.710 --> 29:24.710]  We need to get some passports because a hockey puck.
[29:24.710 --> 29:25.670]  I don't know what they call it there.
[29:26.230 --> 29:29.710]  Um, we've both, uh, I know that I've been requested.
[29:29.710 --> 29:32.510]  My presence has been requested in Canada to help get some things going.
[29:32.830 --> 29:36.350]  So I know I need to try Tim Hortons for our Canada listeners, but I don't know
[29:36.350 --> 29:39.430]  anything else about Canada other than I love all the people I've met from there.
[29:39.430 --> 29:42.750]  What was I taunted with poutine and French women is what I think.
[29:43.310 --> 29:43.510]  Yeah.
[29:43.510 --> 29:43.790]  Right.
[29:43.790 --> 29:45.550]  They said, come get some poutine and French women.
[29:45.550 --> 29:48.350]  And I was like, well, that sounds like a win-win situation for me.
[29:48.390 --> 29:49.750]  There's a lot of people that I've met from there.
[29:49.750 --> 29:51.510]  I was going to say it's fucking a hundred degrees.
[29:51.750 --> 29:52.270]  Let's go.
[29:52.270 --> 29:53.590]  Uh, let's go hear him talk funny.
[29:54.030 --> 29:56.030]  I actually have a random chatter.
[29:56.230 --> 29:59.550]  I lived in Lawrence, Kansas, and I knew a couple of kids from, uh, from Canada.
[29:59.550 --> 30:02.710]  And I'm like, well, some of the coolest fucking kids I hung out with.
[30:02.950 --> 30:03.870]  So one dude was a drummer.
[30:03.870 --> 30:05.230]  He's a huge Neil pert fan.
[30:05.230 --> 30:06.910]  And he said boss diesel a lot.
[30:07.070 --> 30:07.950]  I thought it was pretty funny.
[30:09.150 --> 30:10.910]  That's my Canada story and I'm sticking to it.
[30:11.430 --> 30:11.830]  All right.
[30:11.830 --> 30:15.070]  So, uh, since Mike is going to be talking about Canada, I'm going to
[30:15.070 --> 30:16.270]  give him a little bit of a break.
[30:16.270 --> 30:17.510]  I'm going to give him a little bit of a break.
[30:17.870 --> 30:18.270]  All right.
[30:18.270 --> 30:21.350]  So, uh, since Mike is going to choke for a couple of minutes, I've got an email
[30:21.350 --> 30:24.470]  that I think I should read, and now it's probably the best time I'll leave Mike's
[30:24.470 --> 30:26.310]  microphone on just so that you can hear him over there.
[30:27.190 --> 30:28.030]  I'll put them about halfway.
[30:28.030 --> 30:29.310]  If he decides to talk, I'll turn them up.
[30:30.470 --> 30:33.150]  This email comes from our Canadian friend and it's perfectly timed.
[30:33.510 --> 30:35.870]  Uh, I don't know if he wants his name said we'll get to that part.
[30:35.870 --> 30:37.270]  It says, Hey, Ross, Canadian friend.
[30:37.350 --> 30:38.670]  It actually says his name in the email.
[30:38.670 --> 30:39.430]  He says, Hey, what up?
[30:39.430 --> 30:41.830]  Rasta, Jeff squishy McRosen here.
[30:41.910 --> 30:42.830]  I'll just get right to it.
[30:42.830 --> 30:45.350]  I cannot express enough how thankful I am for your show.
[30:45.710 --> 30:50.430]  After listening, I realized I had to stop and reassess everything I was doing, not
[30:50.430 --> 30:56.030]  just in my garden, but in my life, I was growing illegally, putting my family at
[30:56.030 --> 30:59.310]  risk and doing nothing with the cannabis knowledge I had.
[30:59.790 --> 31:02.190]  So this dude realized one day, probably because I said, you're
[31:02.190 --> 31:03.070]  going to get fucking rated.
[31:03.070 --> 31:03.870]  I've said that on the show.
[31:04.310 --> 31:04.950]  And it's a thing.
[31:05.070 --> 31:06.670]  He thought, Oh man, I'll shoot my dog.
[31:06.670 --> 31:07.430]  I'm taking my kids.
[31:07.430 --> 31:08.150]  It's a fun game.
[31:08.150 --> 31:09.310]  So they shoot your fucking dog.
[31:09.350 --> 31:09.950]  That's the truth.
[31:09.950 --> 31:12.310]  As soon as that front door comes off, life sinks in quickly.
[31:12.310 --> 31:12.950]  Trust me.
[31:13.270 --> 31:16.910]  He says, since listening to you and your amazing guests, that's you, Mike.
[31:17.070 --> 31:18.270]  I've stepped up my game.
[31:18.270 --> 31:22.390]  I've become determined to be a positive light for cannabis, sharing information
[31:22.390 --> 31:23.710]  with anyone that will listen.
[31:24.110 --> 31:27.550]  You have given me the tools to break down barriers and communicate with the people
[31:27.550 --> 31:29.870]  about cannabis who are otherwise uninformed.
[31:30.230 --> 31:33.150]  People are overwhelmed with the amount of cannabis information.
[31:33.150 --> 31:37.350]  I am able to clearly articulate to them and I've never had a negative response.
[31:37.830 --> 31:40.950]  I have sought out a company aimed to assist people in getting people safe
[31:40.950 --> 31:42.590]  access to cannabis in Canada.
[31:43.030 --> 31:47.030]  They're helping me through the process of obtaining a personal production license.
[31:47.030 --> 31:51.470]  I am now able to confidently and clearly express how and why I use cannabis to
[31:51.470 --> 31:55.310]  doctors, which is something I would not have been able to do before.
[31:55.990 --> 32:00.590]  Uh, he says from your episodes, I was able to build a cannabis tailored resume
[32:00.590 --> 32:03.350]  and obtain a position at a licensed producer.
[32:03.750 --> 32:04.830]  So we got another person.
[32:04.830 --> 32:08.230]  This is the second person that I've gotten an email from recently that we got, we
[32:08.230 --> 32:10.710]  helped them get a job in the cannabis industry.
[32:10.990 --> 32:13.630]  He goes on to say, I've also gotten involved in my local cannabis
[32:13.630 --> 32:14.990]  community, attending public.
[32:16.470 --> 32:16.870]  Oh, sorry.
[32:16.870 --> 32:19.310]  The I, the computer just said their updates available.
[32:19.310 --> 32:20.430]  We'll do that way later.
[32:20.430 --> 32:20.950]  Not right now.
[32:20.950 --> 32:21.470]  Don't do it.
[32:21.470 --> 32:24.270]  We're going to have to tell it later because Apple will just keep
[32:24.270 --> 32:25.830]  begging and remind me tomorrow.
[32:25.870 --> 32:26.270]  There we go.
[32:26.310 --> 32:27.350]  We'll keep moving with the email.
[32:27.350 --> 32:31.070]  He says, I've also gotten involved with my local cannabis community, attending
[32:31.310 --> 32:33.030]  public cannabis information sessions.
[32:33.030 --> 32:38.230]  And I participated in several government engagement surveys to ensure my voice is
[32:38.230 --> 32:38.750]  heard.
[32:38.950 --> 32:39.430]  Excellent.
[32:39.430 --> 32:40.430]  This guy's on the right path.
[32:40.430 --> 32:41.270]  Good job, squishy.
[32:41.590 --> 32:44.870]  Uh, he goes on to say recreational cannabis will be legal here in Canada in
[32:44.870 --> 32:45.790]  eight to 12 weeks.
[32:45.790 --> 32:48.470]  And I am proud to have been a part of the process.
[32:49.430 --> 32:50.710]  Here's the part where it gets cool, dude.
[32:50.990 --> 32:56.150]  He says, I believe that you have also contributed indirectly because without
[32:56.150 --> 33:00.510]  the guidance of you and white Mike, I wouldn't have, I would not have gotten
[33:00.510 --> 33:01.350]  involved.
[33:01.830 --> 33:05.470]  So we, we had a little bit of a little bit of the tickle there on Canada doing
[33:05.470 --> 33:05.750]  their thing.
[33:05.750 --> 33:06.790]  Thanks for reading that while I was here.
[33:06.790 --> 33:07.350]  That's awesome.
[33:07.390 --> 33:07.590]  Yeah.
[33:07.590 --> 33:07.910]  Yeah.
[33:07.910 --> 33:09.150]  Well, that's why I've been trying to get you over here.
[33:09.150 --> 33:10.590]  Also do this Canada episode with you.
[33:10.870 --> 33:11.870]  I want to share this with you.
[33:11.910 --> 33:13.350]  It's hard to leave my house right now.
[33:13.390 --> 33:13.710]  Oh dude.
[33:13.710 --> 33:15.830]  He's got two kids and a great wife.
[33:15.830 --> 33:16.670]  I would be there all the time.
[33:16.670 --> 33:18.430]  If I were you, uh, he keeps going.
[33:18.430 --> 33:20.070]  He says, so you're completely right.
[33:20.070 --> 33:22.990]  When you say together, we can legalize cannabis worldwide.
[33:23.430 --> 33:24.390]  Dude, that means a lot to me.
[33:24.510 --> 33:25.990]  Uh, that's, that's huge.
[33:25.990 --> 33:28.230]  I know we're kind of joking about it, but that is huge.
[33:28.230 --> 33:31.110]  Thank you for, uh, first of all, thank you for taking action.
[33:31.110 --> 33:32.390]  Thank you for doing it.
[33:32.390 --> 33:33.110]  You had to do it.
[33:33.110 --> 33:33.830]  I inspired you.
[33:33.830 --> 33:34.470]  I sat here and talk.
[33:34.470 --> 33:35.830]  It was a lot of awesome in that email.
[33:35.950 --> 33:36.110]  Yeah.
[33:36.110 --> 33:38.190]  I sat here and talked behind a microphone and said what to do.
[33:38.190 --> 33:39.550]  You actually had to get off the couch.
[33:39.950 --> 33:42.310]  You had to go get a shaky voice and speak in front of people.
[33:42.630 --> 33:45.270]  Uh, and thanks for giving me a little bit of credit and a man.
[33:45.270 --> 33:46.430]  Thanks for getting inspired.
[33:46.750 --> 33:47.470]  So we're going to keep going.
[33:47.470 --> 33:48.150]  There's a lot more.
[33:48.150 --> 33:51.990]  He says, I'm sure when he started the I grow culture podcast, that's how long
[33:51.990 --> 33:52.910]  the students have been listening.
[33:52.950 --> 33:53.750]  I grow culture.
[33:53.910 --> 33:54.470]  Thank you, bro.
[33:55.390 --> 33:57.470]  For you guys, you guys that don't know, I had to change the name.
[33:57.470 --> 34:01.190]  There's another company called I grow and they got, they got angry about that shit.
[34:01.190 --> 34:02.950]  They did not like the weed leaf logo.
[34:03.430 --> 34:03.710]  Nope.
[34:03.750 --> 34:04.430]  They came at me.
[34:04.430 --> 34:05.710]  We is not amused.
[34:06.030 --> 34:09.710]  Um, I know there's a weird, uh, sense of pride when you get a season to sis.
[34:09.710 --> 34:12.350]  Like, uh, I was stealing from someone.
[34:13.710 --> 34:13.950]  Yeah.
[34:14.150 --> 34:14.390]  Yeah.
[34:14.390 --> 34:14.990]  They noticed.
[34:14.990 --> 34:15.350]  Cool.
[34:15.350 --> 34:17.150]  Someone's looking anyway, we're going to keep going.
[34:17.150 --> 34:20.590]  He said, uh, when he started the, I grow culture, you had no idea just how far it
[34:20.590 --> 34:22.830]  would go and the way it would affect other people's lives.
[34:23.190 --> 34:27.030]  I have so much respect for you and your selfless approach to
[34:27.030 --> 34:28.710]  helping improve people's lives.
[34:28.710 --> 34:30.150]  I hope this email makes your day.
[34:30.390 --> 34:34.830]  The way you made so many of mine, dude, it totally made, it's made my week
[34:34.830 --> 34:37.830]  because I read this several days ago and I knew this show was coming up.
[34:38.030 --> 34:40.870]  So I've just been checking it out and smiling about it all the time.
[34:41.070 --> 34:43.190]  I think I sent a little screenshot, a part of it to Mike.
[34:43.550 --> 34:45.430]  So I gave him a little teaser, man.
[34:45.430 --> 34:45.830]  Thank you.
[34:46.070 --> 34:46.950]  You made my day.
[34:46.950 --> 34:48.430]  I'm glad I'm able to make your day.
[34:48.430 --> 34:50.750]  I'm dude, I'm glad you're out there doing it for Canada.
[34:50.750 --> 34:51.190]  Thank you.
[34:51.550 --> 34:52.750]  I don't know what you guys say in Canada.
[34:52.750 --> 34:54.310]  You got like Rastafarians.
[34:54.310 --> 34:55.070]  We say big up.
[34:55.070 --> 34:55.910]  So big up, bro.
[34:56.270 --> 34:57.110]  The email keeps going.
[34:57.110 --> 35:00.350]  He says, I'm not a Rastafarian, but I praise job for this gift that Rasta Jeff
[35:00.350 --> 35:01.790]  and the grow from your heart podcast.
[35:02.190 --> 35:05.310]  May his light continue to shine on you and your gardens.
[35:05.310 --> 35:09.670]  PS I've taken a fat dab and given my mom a hug for you.
[35:09.670 --> 35:11.590]  This guy's killing it, doing all of it.
[35:11.990 --> 35:13.070]  He's got it all correct, bro.
[35:13.070 --> 35:13.670]  Thank you, man.
[35:13.910 --> 35:15.350]  I appreciate the support.
[35:15.630 --> 35:18.750]  Thanks for being part of the Irie army, Squishy McRozin.
[35:19.070 --> 35:19.710]  I appreciate that.
[35:19.710 --> 35:23.510]  You're definitely team Irie genetics, grow from your heart crew,
[35:23.830 --> 35:24.590]  whatever you want to call it.
[35:24.590 --> 35:26.350]  Now we need some sort of cool name.
[35:26.590 --> 35:27.590]  We've got the Irie army.
[35:27.590 --> 35:29.670]  What are we going to go with the podcast listeners?
[35:29.670 --> 35:30.470]  Just the Irie army.
[35:30.470 --> 35:31.190]  Is that what we are?
[35:31.670 --> 35:33.230]  Definitely part of that Irie army.
[35:33.230 --> 35:34.270]  So we appreciate that.
[35:34.310 --> 35:35.430]  We're going to make that stick.
[35:35.430 --> 35:37.190]  Can't base it off any of my nicknames.
[35:37.430 --> 35:38.630]  We're going to skip that.
[35:39.030 --> 35:40.070]  Uh, it's the Irie army.
[35:40.430 --> 35:40.870]  Squishy.
[35:40.870 --> 35:42.030]  Thank you for the great email, dude.
[35:42.030 --> 35:42.470]  I appreciate it.
[35:42.470 --> 35:43.470]  I know I've said it over and over.
[35:43.630 --> 35:44.390]  I'm fucking high as shit.
[35:44.390 --> 35:45.710]  I want to make sure I say it seriously.
[35:45.910 --> 35:47.150]  I get jokey when I get stoned.
[35:47.150 --> 35:48.150]  I don't take shit super serious.
[35:48.150 --> 35:50.630]  I want to make sure you realize how much I appreciate that.
[35:50.870 --> 35:51.910]  Thank you for the great email.
[35:52.150 --> 35:52.950]  Congrats, bro.
[35:53.030 --> 35:56.990]  Congrats on the, uh, the success up there to the north and Canada.
[35:57.030 --> 35:58.190]  Let us know how it's going.
[35:59.190 --> 36:01.270]  I, uh, I'm going to follow Canada pretty closely.
[36:01.270 --> 36:05.790]  They've, uh, I've seen some concerning press already where I'm like, Oh,
[36:05.790 --> 36:06.110]  really?
[36:06.110 --> 36:07.150]  That had to happen already.
[36:07.230 --> 36:08.990]  And I've seen some stuff from like fuck.
[36:09.030 --> 36:09.350]  Yeah.
[36:09.350 --> 36:10.110]  Canada.
[36:10.790 --> 36:13.150]  Um, and I've almost never said that in my life.
[36:13.150 --> 36:16.950]  So it's a, definitely a cool time for Canada, Oklahoma as well.
[36:17.430 --> 36:18.510]  But now Mike, I've got one.
[36:18.590 --> 36:19.870]  I may have two more questions for you.
[36:19.870 --> 36:22.190]  Depends on how long we go on this one question.
[36:22.550 --> 36:26.030]  Um, how long until we're federally legal here in the States now?
[36:26.070 --> 36:29.310]  Um, I used to think about, it would take us about another decade,
[36:29.470 --> 36:30.430]  about another decade.
[36:30.470 --> 36:35.790]  Um, if you follow politics at all, you know, that everything that was
[36:35.790 --> 36:37.310]  true on Monday is true anymore.
[36:38.190 --> 36:38.750]  That's true.
[36:38.790 --> 36:41.790]  We live in a banana attic time where we're led by an orange, crazy person.
[36:42.150 --> 36:42.670]  Yes.
[36:42.990 --> 36:48.590]  Um, so 10 years, you think I'd be down?
[36:48.590 --> 36:51.830]  Well, I would be cool with, I'd be satisfied with seeing so many, so many
[36:51.830 --> 36:55.030]  things that are in play on this particular question or up here in the
[36:55.030 --> 36:55.590]  air right now.
[36:56.230 --> 37:00.430]  Um, that wasn't true under any of the previous presidencies or any
[37:00.430 --> 37:01.310]  other time in our life.
[37:01.310 --> 37:04.950]  I was going to add that the deciding factor is probably the next two
[37:04.950 --> 37:08.110]  presidential elections is what would decide that the midterms are going
[37:08.110 --> 37:09.790]  to be insanely important.
[37:10.550 --> 37:15.350]  Um, and then the next presidential is going to be huge.
[37:15.950 --> 37:16.910]  It'll be huge.
[37:17.070 --> 37:19.870]  And the presidential after that will also be huge.
[37:20.230 --> 37:20.750]  Yeah.
[37:20.750 --> 37:28.190]  By the time the next presidential happens, like another Supreme court
[37:28.190 --> 37:30.190]  seat will be there open or damn near close.
[37:30.190 --> 37:31.870]  We just had one open up this week.
[37:32.630 --> 37:38.670]  Um, Senate population changes rapidly right now.
[37:39.270 --> 37:45.790]  Um, we just saw like a legit fucking socialist when, um, the person who
[37:45.790 --> 37:49.830]  was going to take over for like the ranking Democrat, they were the next
[37:49.830 --> 37:55.830]  in line for the throne, um, got defucking thrown in a primary to like
[37:55.830 --> 38:00.790]  a 28 year old unknown chick with like a super immigrant name.
[38:00.790 --> 38:06.150]  Like she had a long fucking hill to climb and just home run, home run,
[38:06.150 --> 38:08.390]  home run, home run, won the fucking election.
[38:08.550 --> 38:09.030]  Nice.
[38:09.110 --> 38:13.350]  Um, and right now that is a big deal.
[38:13.350 --> 38:18.350]  And right now that in a couple of other things, along with president
[38:18.350 --> 38:23.630]  Trump and all of those, everything's like, I don't want to get into it too
[38:23.630 --> 38:29.270]  much and make the show super political, but a lot of shit that would affect
[38:29.310 --> 38:33.590]  federal legalization happening or not happening is all up in the air right now.
[38:34.110 --> 38:38.230]  Um, the hardcore members of the Senate that are against it might not have
[38:38.230 --> 38:40.910]  jobs in six months or a year, 18 months.
[38:41.630 --> 38:45.270]  The people that are for it also might not have jobs in 18 months.
[38:45.310 --> 38:45.590]  Right.
[38:45.590 --> 38:46.390]  Everyone could switch.
[38:46.430 --> 38:50.910]  Um, president Trump could fucking legalize it through some sort of bizarre
[38:50.910 --> 38:55.950]  decree, um, or he could start really pushing the Senate to do it the proper
[38:55.950 --> 38:56.390]  way.
[38:57.030 --> 38:59.190]  Um, or he could get impeached.
[38:59.710 --> 39:03.750]  Like this could go a lot of different ways, people, or he could fucking
[39:03.750 --> 39:05.230]  just OD on diet pills one day.
[39:06.550 --> 39:10.430]  It's the world is a very strange place right now.
[39:11.070 --> 39:15.030]  And in predicting something like federal legalization, that's going to take so
[39:15.030 --> 39:20.990]  many different acts of law and like, that's tough, but I wouldn't expect it
[39:20.990 --> 39:25.230]  anytime soon, definitely don't invest money tomorrow based on it happening soon.
[39:25.590 --> 39:27.550]  One more, one more thing I kind of want to touch on that.
[39:27.550 --> 39:30.670]  I honestly have no education on, but I know that this is a thing
[39:30.670 --> 39:31.710]  somewhere along the line.
[39:32.270 --> 39:37.550]  When Canada legalizes, has legalized cannabis and when the states finally
[39:37.550 --> 39:41.870]  legalized federally, what sort of international rules or treaties are we
[39:41.870 --> 39:42.230]  breaking?
[39:42.230 --> 39:46.510]  Because I've heard there's Russia mentioned, there's a major UN convention
[39:46.510 --> 39:55.230]  that says you can't legalize basically narcotics, um, drugs of abuse and
[39:55.230 --> 39:55.870]  enjoyment.
[39:56.710 --> 39:59.230]  Um, if it's not beer, you can't legalize it.
[39:59.430 --> 39:59.670]  Yeah.
[39:59.870 --> 40:05.950]  Um, it's a policy that the U S really, really pushed.
[40:06.110 --> 40:09.350]  Like it's basically ours that we forced on the rest of the world.
[40:10.110 --> 40:14.790]  Um, the rest of the world was happy to jump on our bullshit.
[40:15.270 --> 40:17.990]  So it's not all our fault, but it's all our fault.
[40:18.270 --> 40:20.710]  So we let the grenade and now we're falling on it.
[40:20.710 --> 40:21.350]  Ourselves.
[40:21.590 --> 40:24.830]  There's a number of countries that have called us on it and the, in the
[40:24.830 --> 40:26.270]  UN and call us out on our shit.
[40:26.270 --> 40:28.790]  Like, Hey, you push this on everybody.
[40:28.790 --> 40:30.950]  And now Colorado and Washington fucking did what?
[40:31.670 --> 40:35.230]  Um, I mean, they say it in German, so no one in the U S knows it happened.
[40:35.990 --> 40:39.990]  But it did happen and it's happened repeatedly.
[40:40.030 --> 40:42.270]  Um, it just hasn't had much of an impact yet.
[40:42.310 --> 40:45.350]  The anti-pop people bring it up every now and then like, we'll be
[40:45.350 --> 40:47.110]  in violation of UN convention.
[40:47.630 --> 40:51.870]  It's like, well, fucking Russia invaded a country and we just kind of chilled.
[40:52.150 --> 40:57.710]  It's kind of like, no one's going to like fucking cut us off trade
[40:57.710 --> 40:59.030]  because we legalized weed.
[40:59.110 --> 41:01.870]  Well, I thought I saw a headline while I was skimming through doing a quick,
[41:01.870 --> 41:04.510]  a little check that Russia was already offended that we're doing it.
[41:04.510 --> 41:05.590]  Well, that's Canada's doing it.
[41:05.950 --> 41:09.430]  That's one of the things that we're really going to see with Canada now, like no one
[41:09.430 --> 41:14.590]  really cared when Uruguay did it and their global impact, I mean, it's
[41:14.590 --> 41:18.990]  substantial for Uruguay, but it's not substantial for some of the other major
[41:18.990 --> 41:22.590]  countries, especially when compared to Canada, like they're not comparable
[41:22.590 --> 41:24.950]  trading partners as far as I'm aware in any way.
[41:25.510 --> 41:30.510]  And so when Canada does this a lot, a lot of people who were able to completely
[41:30.510 --> 41:33.990]  ignore Uruguay doing it cannot at all ignore Canada.
[41:34.030 --> 41:34.430]  All right.
[41:34.510 --> 41:35.310]  That makes more sense.
[41:35.870 --> 41:37.070]  Makes much more sense.
[41:38.070 --> 41:38.470]  All right.
[41:38.950 --> 41:40.350]  Uh, you got any more for Canada?
[41:40.670 --> 41:42.070]  Want to make sure we legit all your notes.
[41:42.790 --> 41:43.270]  There you go.
[41:43.270 --> 41:44.190]  Way to go.
[41:44.230 --> 41:44.670]  Canada.
[41:44.670 --> 41:46.670]  We'll quit making, making fun of you.
[41:46.710 --> 41:48.390]  Smoke a joint and watch the mocky.
[41:48.990 --> 41:52.150]  Well, I guess the most horrible thing I've said on here, we're not going to make,
[41:52.230 --> 41:55.150]  quit making funny because Mike had one more burn to throw at you.
[41:55.470 --> 41:56.310]  I love you guys.
[41:56.310 --> 41:58.190]  You it's, I know it's not perfect.
[41:58.190 --> 41:59.670]  I know there are a lot of issues with it.
[41:59.670 --> 42:03.670]  I know some of the penalties for going around or outside of the limits
[42:03.990 --> 42:07.110]  are just as harsh or harsher than they are now.
[42:07.110 --> 42:12.630]  But, uh, trust me, give it a few minutes, participate, make sure that the laws,
[42:13.230 --> 42:17.630]  the zoning, the distribution stuff, the conversation around it is rational.
[42:17.670 --> 42:22.190]  And, uh, you'll be a lot happier with legalization than you
[42:22.190 --> 42:23.390]  ever were with prohibition.
[42:23.390 --> 42:23.870]  Trust me.
[42:24.790 --> 42:25.270]  All right.
[42:25.350 --> 42:27.070]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to give a few shout outs right quick.
[42:27.070 --> 42:28.630]  I'm just going to jump right in with shout outs.
[42:28.790 --> 42:33.110]  I'm gonna give a shout out to Tanner M a shout out to Melanie Alexander.
[42:33.790 --> 42:36.110]  And a shout out to Todd Keller.
[42:36.190 --> 42:37.790]  That's what I got for you for shout outs for today.
[42:37.790 --> 42:39.710]  We're going to keep going with the podcast after that.
[42:40.070 --> 42:41.350]  I just wanted to make sure to do that.
[42:41.350 --> 42:42.750]  Cause I kind of been skipping on that.
[42:42.750 --> 42:45.470]  I've been slacking on that, but I still think about you guys.
[42:45.710 --> 42:47.070]  I want to make sure to get some shout outs in there.
[42:47.070 --> 42:48.350]  Let's move forward with the podcast.
[42:48.670 --> 42:49.790]  Hey Mike, thanks for hanging out, dude.
[42:49.790 --> 42:50.710]  I see you grabbing the phone.
[42:50.910 --> 42:51.110]  Yes.
[42:51.110 --> 42:52.430]  You've been here for quite a while.
[42:52.430 --> 42:54.590]  We're going to have to start wrapping up the show and get you back to the kids
[42:54.590 --> 42:59.310]  and the wife and the animals, the chaos, uh, back out there in the heat.
[42:59.310 --> 43:00.790]  So that you can get ready for tomorrow.
[43:00.870 --> 43:02.190]  Go crushing the heat again.
[43:02.390 --> 43:02.890]  Yup.
[43:03.450 --> 43:04.850]  God, you guys, we need some air conditioning.
[43:04.850 --> 43:07.050]  If you could just turn up the air conditioner in Colorado, that'd be cool.
[43:07.050 --> 43:07.690]  Just a little bit.
[43:07.690 --> 43:11.690]  If you're in Southern Colorado, like we need to all get together on a Facebook
[43:11.690 --> 43:14.570]  page or a fucking Twitter account or something, and then I'll go outside and
[43:14.570 --> 43:16.490]  like spray a hose in the air for 20 minutes together.
[43:16.570 --> 43:17.570]  I don't know if that's even going to work.
[43:17.570 --> 43:19.050]  Who do we complain to about this heat?
[43:19.050 --> 43:20.130]  Can I see your manager?
[43:20.170 --> 43:20.850]  It's hot.
[43:21.210 --> 43:23.810]  I haven't like a hundred in five.
[43:23.970 --> 43:25.410]  I'm not built for this people.
[43:26.370 --> 43:27.530]  I'm not built for this.
[43:27.690 --> 43:29.730]  Check, check on, check on your big friends, people.
[43:29.730 --> 43:30.450]  It's hot out there.
[43:30.890 --> 43:33.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget about the hell a dank seed company.
[43:33.970 --> 43:35.170]  Fourth of July sale.
[43:35.170 --> 43:37.370]  God, it's fourth of July already, dude.
[43:37.410 --> 43:38.930]  It was just four 20 last week.
[43:38.930 --> 43:39.610]  What's happening.
[43:39.770 --> 43:40.370]  It's fine.
[43:40.410 --> 43:41.730]  Fourth of July sale is coming up.
[43:41.730 --> 43:42.230]  That's right.
[43:42.450 --> 43:45.450]  Uh, from July 3rd through July 5th, that's a short window.
[43:45.610 --> 43:49.690]  If you use coupon code, I read 20, you can get 20% off your entire purchase.
[43:49.690 --> 43:53.450]  Plus there will be a new drop of IRI genetics coming soon.
[43:53.690 --> 43:55.090]  I'm working on the custom packaging.
[43:55.090 --> 43:57.170]  If the custom packaging happens on time, it will come in that.
[43:57.170 --> 43:59.290]  If not, it'll be in that old standard packaging.
[43:59.290 --> 44:00.130]  We're working on it.
[44:01.010 --> 44:02.130]  We're trying to get it there.
[44:02.170 --> 44:02.810]  We're trying.
[44:03.730 --> 44:04.250]  We're trying.
[44:04.250 --> 44:05.770]  Don't forget about the hell it ain't seed company guys.
[44:05.770 --> 44:07.290]  You can find them at dank seed.store.
[44:07.290 --> 44:08.250]  They've got regular seed.

[44:08.890 --> 44:09.170]  I see.

[44:10.290 --> 44:11.170]  They've got bog.

[44:37.450 --> 44:41.010]  Mike is at nemo punk 15 on most of the social media.
[44:41.250 --> 44:43.890]  Also make sure you check out Mike's Facebook page.
[44:43.890 --> 44:46.290]  It is Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.

[44:48.410 --> 44:49.490]  Let him know you're following him.
[44:49.690 --> 44:51.530]  Let him know that you support legalization.
[44:51.530 --> 44:55.370]  If you've got questions about getting active about legalization, if you need
[44:55.370 --> 44:58.130]  guidance, if you just want to say what's up, go talk to my dude, he's
[44:58.130 --> 44:59.410]  hanging out with the kids all the time.
[44:59.570 --> 45:01.210]  He could use some interaction.
[45:01.250 --> 45:02.410]  I can chat on the phone.
[45:02.410 --> 45:06.330]  Like whatever, just getting over here for podcasts is so hard with two kids.
[45:06.370 --> 45:06.610]  Yeah.
[45:06.610 --> 45:09.090]  He can set the kids in the lab before you double up.
[45:09.090 --> 45:12.130]  Y'all wrap it up.
[45:12.130 --> 45:12.930]  So you don't double up.
[45:13.970 --> 45:14.810]  That's words of wisdom.
[45:14.810 --> 45:16.690]  Fucking live by that ought to be a shirt.
[45:17.970 --> 45:20.810]  If someone puts that on a shirt, they're going to make a lot of money selling
[45:20.810 --> 45:21.570]  them and that's all I know.
[45:21.570 --> 45:23.010]  We're already working on other shirts.
[45:23.010 --> 45:24.850]  Big shout out to my friend, non-toxic Yogi.
[45:24.850 --> 45:26.810]  I want to thank everybody for all the love and support.
[45:27.090 --> 45:29.410]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you've got something you'd like to say, and you're
[45:29.410 --> 45:33.530]  not into all that social media stuff, or if you'd like to sponsor the podcast,
[45:33.530 --> 45:37.730]  or if you've got a product you'd like me to review, whatever, if you'd like to
[45:37.730 --> 45:39.810]  just reach out, send me an email.
[45:39.850 --> 45:43.170]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[45:43.250 --> 45:44.450]  I love hearing from you.
[45:44.450 --> 45:46.290]  I've got a lot of emails that need to get caught up.
[45:46.530 --> 45:48.410]  I've been packing the show with grow lessons.
[45:48.410 --> 45:50.090]  We will get back to emails pretty soon.
[45:50.090 --> 45:50.970]  I know they're there.
[45:51.410 --> 45:53.130]  You guys seem to have been loving the grow lessons.
[45:53.410 --> 45:57.210]  The podcast is ranked 635 out of 40,000 shows.
[45:57.570 --> 45:59.490]  I must be doing something right.
[45:59.490 --> 46:01.610]  So yeah, we're going to, we're going to keep going the way we're going.
[46:01.610 --> 46:03.050]  We'll get back to emails pretty soon.
[46:03.330 --> 46:04.450]  We'll blend some of those in.
[46:04.690 --> 46:07.490]  You guys, you can listen to the podcast on iTunes.
[46:07.490 --> 46:08.890]  You can listen to the show on Stitcher.
[46:09.010 --> 46:10.410]  Hey, I'm working with Stitcher.
[46:10.410 --> 46:13.010]  They told me one way to try to fix a show that shit didn't work, dude.
[46:13.290 --> 46:14.410]  Um, I'm sending them emails.
[46:14.410 --> 46:15.130]  We're going to figure it out.
[46:15.130 --> 46:17.490]  I apologize that the Stitcher application doesn't work.
[46:17.730 --> 46:20.970]  Hopefully, hopefully you figured out that you can listen to it on the Stitcher
[46:20.970 --> 46:22.450]  website, you don't have to use the app.
[46:22.650 --> 46:24.210]  Maybe you can go to YouTube.
[46:24.210 --> 46:26.250]  I put every single episode on YouTube.
[46:27.410 --> 46:29.370]  You're a Stitcher listener who's converted to YouTube.
[46:29.370 --> 46:31.010]  I see a lot of listens on YouTube.
[46:31.810 --> 46:35.530]  If you guys continue to listen on YouTube, I will improve the videos.
[46:35.770 --> 46:39.050]  I know that sounds like I'm bargaining with you, but I've got more time now.
[46:39.050 --> 46:41.450]  And if I see that that's a thing, I will do it better.
[46:41.770 --> 46:44.850]  Um, and when I see that it gets response, I will improve it, but it just
[46:44.850 --> 46:46.730]  takes a lot of time to make videos.
[46:47.010 --> 46:49.810]  I'll start putting, I don't want to make these high quality videos and
[46:49.810 --> 46:52.810]  have YouTube jack my channel, but they gave custom grow back his channel.
[46:52.810 --> 46:55.010]  They give they're giving people back their channels.
[46:55.010 --> 46:56.010]  So I think I'm safe.
[46:56.690 --> 46:58.810]  I'm not getting revolted pretty good.
[46:58.810 --> 47:01.370]  And I don't know if it was enough though.
[47:01.370 --> 47:07.090]  Like this, one of the other benefits of being a home country being legal.
[47:07.370 --> 47:07.870]  Yeah.
[47:07.930 --> 47:09.730]  Is that's not an issue anymore.
[47:09.770 --> 47:13.210]  No, the heat you're going to take for getting up and standing up and saying
[47:13.210 --> 47:15.250]  the rules around this should be rational.
[47:15.250 --> 47:19.410]  Like if that's your message, the heat you're going to take for that's
[47:19.450 --> 47:20.530]  going to be pretty minimal.
[47:21.170 --> 47:24.890]  Um, whereas if you stand up and do that in a prohibition area, the heat you're
[47:24.890 --> 47:27.530]  going to take for that can be pretty intense for sure.
[47:27.810 --> 47:28.450]  For sure.
[47:28.930 --> 47:29.430]  All right.
[47:30.050 --> 47:32.090]  Um, y'all make the YouTube videos better.
[47:32.530 --> 47:33.930]  I'll start putting more images in there.
[47:34.250 --> 47:37.010]  Maybe I don't like recording my face and doing the show like that.
[47:37.010 --> 47:38.090]  I just really don't like doing it.
[47:38.290 --> 47:40.010]  I've done a couple, maybe I'll do more of those.
[47:40.250 --> 47:43.890]  Just depends if, if I get enough YouTube interaction, maybe we'll start doing that.
[47:44.130 --> 47:45.650]  Um, don't forget about Patrion.
[47:45.970 --> 47:46.470]  All right.
[47:46.650 --> 47:48.810]  Um, ladies and gentlemen, thanks for listening to the podcast.
[47:49.010 --> 47:51.450]  Thanks for coming and hanging out, taking time from them.
[47:52.090 --> 47:52.690]  Hey, Mike's wife.
[47:52.690 --> 47:54.850]  If you ever happen to listen to the podcast, thanks for letting me
[47:54.850 --> 47:56.210]  borrow your husband for a podcast.
[47:56.210 --> 47:58.650]  I bring them over here and he gets high shit and rambles for a little bit.
[47:59.770 --> 48:00.890]  He said, thanks, wife.
[48:00.890 --> 48:01.770]  Sorry, kids.
[48:02.370 --> 48:02.870]  Yup.
[48:03.290 --> 48:03.790]  All right.
[48:03.850 --> 48:07.370]  Um, you guys do what you can do to get cannabis legalized in your area.
[48:07.570 --> 48:09.530]  Get active, get loud, get your voice heard.
[48:09.690 --> 48:10.610]  Don't be afraid.
[48:10.970 --> 48:13.810]  Anyone can go to a public meeting and listen or talk.
[48:14.010 --> 48:17.170]  Anyone can write a letter to their local paper and have it published.
[48:17.530 --> 48:18.850]  It's free content for the paper.
[48:18.850 --> 48:20.570]  They fucking publish everything.
[48:20.970 --> 48:24.850]  Don't show up to the city council meetings, blazed out, go professional,
[48:24.850 --> 48:26.610]  put on a colored shirt, look nice.
[48:26.850 --> 48:28.810]  Represent us clean shirt.
[48:29.250 --> 48:29.970]  Comb your hair.
[48:30.250 --> 48:32.890]  If that's a thing, clean do rag.
[48:32.930 --> 48:34.450]  If it's not comb your hair.
[48:34.530 --> 48:39.890]  Um, Hey, for 99% of the population, those words aren't a fuck you.
[48:40.970 --> 48:43.530]  I try to remember that it's not just us talking on here.
[48:43.530 --> 48:45.130]  So I don't advocate crazy shit.
[48:45.970 --> 48:49.290]  Um, but, uh, I mean, anyone can do this.
[48:49.290 --> 48:53.010]  If you're not the type of person who's comfortable public speaking and you're
[48:53.010 --> 48:54.930]  more comfortable writing an email.
[48:55.610 --> 49:00.090]  Um, like there's the newspaper can't like look you up and be like,
[49:00.090 --> 49:01.530]  fucking Donnie Brasco don't live there.
[49:02.050 --> 49:07.610]  If you, if you make up a decent pen, a nom de plumb or a pen name and send a
[49:07.610 --> 49:12.130]  letter to your local paper advocating legalization under a pseudonym, like
[49:12.130 --> 49:15.810]  that's not a crime and there'll be more than happy to publish it.
[49:15.810 --> 49:20.210]  If you use appropriate language and make rational arguments, um,
[49:20.610 --> 49:21.850]  and anyone can do that.
[49:22.290 --> 49:22.490]  Yep.
[49:22.530 --> 49:23.770]  And everybody can do that.
[49:24.410 --> 49:28.530]  Um, email, email, local officials, just follow this stuff and be informed.
[49:28.930 --> 49:32.890]  And when it comes up in conversation, enlighten the conversation.
[49:33.170 --> 49:37.170]  Also, if you're one of the people like me who knows way too much about weed, one
[49:37.170 --> 49:40.850]  of the things I found helpful with non-weed people is ask them how much they want to
[49:40.850 --> 49:41.170]  know.
[49:41.450 --> 49:41.770]  Yeah.
[49:41.890 --> 49:46.410]  Cause sometimes we have a tendency to kind of dump truck, unload our information
[49:46.410 --> 49:50.690]  onto people and they're like, I just wanted some weed that'll my girl will like,
[49:50.690 --> 49:52.010]  she said, go buy his weed.
[49:52.010 --> 49:54.490]  So I'm at the weed store by Clementine for girls.
[49:54.530 --> 50:00.650]  Like now I know, you know, a master's degree worth about weed and she's pissed
[50:00.650 --> 50:02.770]  because I'm at the store for an hour and a half.
[50:03.210 --> 50:03.490]  Yep.
[50:03.530 --> 50:04.890]  Like, yeah, just ask.
[50:05.050 --> 50:05.290]  All right.
[50:05.290 --> 50:06.850]  You guys get yourselves active out there.
[50:07.010 --> 50:09.970]  And I always say this every time, if you're going to be involved in writing,
[50:10.010 --> 50:13.170]  making, creating the rules of legislation around cannabis in your area, please
[50:13.170 --> 50:14.570]  include some more to consume.
[50:14.570 --> 50:16.170]  There's nowhere to smoke legally here.
[50:16.650 --> 50:17.450]  Give us dude.
[50:17.450 --> 50:19.770]  How about a smoking park and outdoor smoke park?
[50:20.650 --> 50:23.130]  Oh, Mike just not a, just like a dog park for stoners.
[50:23.170 --> 50:23.650]  Yeah, exactly.
[50:23.650 --> 50:24.250]  That's what I saw.
[50:24.490 --> 50:26.650]  Just put your dudes kicking around a hacky sack, throwing a frisbee.
[50:26.650 --> 50:28.850]  Like if you're a cat, people don't go to this park.
[50:29.010 --> 50:31.650]  Like that's, you're not discriminating against cats, right?
[50:31.690 --> 50:33.370]  Like we could non-smokers.
[50:33.650 --> 50:33.930]  Yeah.
[50:33.970 --> 50:34.330]  Fuck them.
[50:34.330 --> 50:35.130]  We could have a park.
[50:35.210 --> 50:35.610]  Yeah.
[50:36.330 --> 50:36.650]  Yeah.
[50:37.050 --> 50:39.010]  They'd make us put up fucking shit.
[50:39.010 --> 50:39.730]  You can't see through it.
[50:39.730 --> 50:39.970]  Running.
[50:39.970 --> 50:40.890]  I'm cool with that, bro.
[50:40.890 --> 50:43.610]  As long as we can be outside, got a picnic table and a couple of chairs.
[50:43.610 --> 50:46.290]  Make it like smoking lounges in the airport 10 years ago.
[50:46.370 --> 50:49.650]  That was not pleasant, but do include some sort of smoking consumption area.
[50:49.650 --> 50:52.690]  I know I joke a lot, but an outside smoke park, maybe an inside.
[50:53.050 --> 50:54.570]  Like somewhere where you can go kick it.
[50:54.890 --> 50:58.130]  People will say, have an outdoor patio.
[50:58.210 --> 51:01.530]  I loved it when we could go to different places and smoke.
[51:01.530 --> 51:04.650]  There was the Canada, the Canada Canyon was set up real classy.
[51:04.930 --> 51:09.850]  It was painted kind of, I mean, for a smoke lounge for what we had, it was painted.
[51:09.850 --> 51:14.850]  And actually it was a decorated by a yoga chick.
[51:15.210 --> 51:17.610]  Like it was very yoga chick, like in there.
[51:17.610 --> 51:18.530]  So it felt kind of nice.
[51:18.530 --> 51:18.890]  You know what I mean?
[51:18.890 --> 51:19.490]  It was clean.
[51:19.490 --> 51:20.410]  I had hardwood floors.
[51:20.410 --> 51:22.210]  It had some Ikea couches.
[51:22.530 --> 51:23.810]  There were paintings on the wall.
[51:23.810 --> 51:25.370]  The real colors.
[51:25.370 --> 51:27.570]  I'll give it that there were no TVs.
[51:27.650 --> 51:29.850]  There was no loud music and it was chill.
[51:30.130 --> 51:33.650]  Then right across town was the, uh, the dab lounge.
[51:33.850 --> 51:34.970]  They got pool tables.
[51:35.210 --> 51:38.210]  They've got fucking a stage with comedians live.
[51:38.250 --> 51:40.850]  It's more of like a bar kind of place.
[51:40.850 --> 51:41.170]  Yeah.
[51:41.490 --> 51:44.970]  And then right across town is the a 64 where they actually turned
[51:44.970 --> 51:46.730]  an old bar into a smoke club.
[51:46.890 --> 51:48.930]  So where there's a bar and people are just sitting at the bar
[51:48.930 --> 51:50.050]  smoking, watching the game.
[51:50.490 --> 51:54.370]  It was mostly just dudes, our age smoking a joint, watching the game.
[51:54.650 --> 51:56.090]  And like, can I get another pre-roll?
[51:56.090 --> 51:59.170]  And the girl up there just passes them pre-rolls and she charges, just
[51:59.170 --> 52:00.210]  like they're getting another drink.
[52:00.370 --> 52:02.890]  They just sit up there and smoke pre-rolls and dabs and watch the game.
[52:02.970 --> 52:06.410]  People freak out about that concept, but it's like, we already have an
[52:06.410 --> 52:11.210]  infrastructure built for people to gather at a location, become intoxicated
[52:11.570 --> 52:13.330]  and have someone else deliver them home.
[52:13.850 --> 52:17.450]  Like we fucking invented that shit for bars and football games and literally
[52:17.450 --> 52:21.730]  every other event adults gather in groups of more than three, like, there's
[52:21.730 --> 52:23.290]  no reason we can't do this with the weed.
[52:23.290 --> 52:25.370]  Other than people, we, people are uptight about it.
[52:25.370 --> 52:26.530]  People are scared.
[52:26.530 --> 52:29.930]  You should hear the conversations around that, around this topic in Denver.
[52:30.130 --> 52:31.650]  It's absolutely not.
[52:31.690 --> 52:31.850]  Yeah.
[52:31.850 --> 52:32.850]  It's going crazy right now.
[52:33.130 --> 52:34.690]  We definitely need somewhere for
[52:34.690 --> 52:36.610]  we got really close to having that.
[52:36.610 --> 52:40.370]  And we just, it just, our latest attempt just failed.
[52:40.610 --> 52:40.850]  Yeah.
[52:40.850 --> 52:41.970]  Again, again.
[52:42.410 --> 52:44.810]  All right, guys, we're about to wrap up the show and we got super rambly.
[52:44.810 --> 52:46.330]  That's what a bunch of good sativa dab.
[52:46.330 --> 52:47.970]  There's some German poison in that stuff.
[52:48.330 --> 52:50.690]  They do like it when we ramble, they absolutely do.
[52:50.690 --> 52:51.930]  You guys, thanks for supporting the show.
[52:51.930 --> 52:52.610]  Thanks for listening.
[52:52.610 --> 52:55.810]  Thanks for all the interactions, my emails, my Twitter, my
[52:55.810 --> 52:57.890]  Facebook, my Instagram, my Patreon.
[52:58.090 --> 52:59.650]  Everything has been blowing up lately.
[52:59.650 --> 53:01.970]  The Helladank Seed Company has been going crazy lately.
[53:02.250 --> 53:04.090]  I truly appreciate all of the support.
[53:04.090 --> 53:07.690]  I've been changing my life to be more available for what I want to do.
[53:07.690 --> 53:09.650]  And this podcast is part of what I want to do.
[53:09.650 --> 53:11.050]  This is heavily what I want to do.
[53:11.410 --> 53:14.770]  Uh, so thank you for supporting my endeavors without the support from
[53:14.770 --> 53:18.530]  all my friends and family, uh, my listeners, my network, I would not
[53:18.530 --> 53:19.690]  be able to live the way I live.
[53:19.850 --> 53:21.890]  So I appreciate you guys and I love you for it.
[53:22.170 --> 53:24.250]  I'm going to wrap up the podcast before I start crying.
[53:24.330 --> 53:24.850]  No, I'm just kidding.
[53:25.290 --> 53:26.010]  Thank you, everybody.
[53:26.010 --> 53:27.370]  You guys are just awesome listeners.
[53:27.410 --> 53:28.090]  We love all of you.
[53:28.290 --> 53:28.770]  Uh, yeah.
[53:28.770 --> 53:29.010]  Yeah.
[53:29.010 --> 53:29.850]  Each and every one of you.
[53:29.850 --> 53:30.170]  Yeah.
[53:30.410 --> 53:32.330]  Ooh, there's that one guy over there.
[53:32.690 --> 53:33.250]  That one guy.
[53:33.290 --> 53:34.450]  No, you're cool, bro.
[53:34.450 --> 53:35.450]  You can be part of the group again.
[53:35.450 --> 53:36.090]  We'll bring you back.
[53:36.290 --> 53:38.130]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks again for listening to the podcast.
[53:38.130 --> 53:40.450]  You know, I'll be back in just a couple of days with another episode.
[53:40.770 --> 53:43.690]  I know this episode had no grow lessons in it, but you got a whole bunch.
[53:43.810 --> 53:44.690]  We'll get back onto that.
[53:44.810 --> 53:45.890]  We'll also get to some emails.
[53:46.050 --> 53:47.450]  You got a lot of great stuff coming up.
[53:47.690 --> 53:49.570]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to wrap up the podcast.
[53:49.570 --> 53:52.290]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Kelvin Medina in Oklahoma.
[53:52.490 --> 53:53.650]  What up Kelvin?
[53:53.850 --> 53:56.850]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
