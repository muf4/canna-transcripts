[00:00.000 --> 00:01.880]  Hey, what's up, podcast world?
[00:01.880 --> 00:05.640]  It's Rasta Jeff, and it's Thursday, so that means it's time for another Throwback Thursday
[00:05.640 --> 00:07.920]  episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.920 --> 00:15.380]  This time, I'm posting episodes 66, 67, 68, 69, and 70 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:15.380 --> 00:17.720]  If you're new to the show, let me explain what I'm doing.
[00:17.720 --> 00:20.500]  A lot of listeners have been asking for the old episodes.
[00:20.500 --> 00:25.480]  A lot of the old episodes have really detailed grow lessons, and there's an episode where
[00:25.480 --> 00:27.160]  I schedule a perpetual grow.
[00:27.160 --> 00:30.120]  There's an episode where I talk about drying and curing buds.
[00:30.120 --> 00:34.480]  A lot of the good stuff is in the old episodes when I first started, and a lot of those episodes
[00:34.480 --> 00:35.800]  have fallen out of the feed.
[00:35.800 --> 00:38.840]  iTunes and Stitcher only hold 100 episodes.
[00:38.840 --> 00:45.120]  This will be episode 226, so that means there are 126 episodes that have fallen out of iTunes.
[00:45.120 --> 00:48.840]  I wanted to put them back somehow, but I figured that every time I put in a new episode, a
[00:48.840 --> 00:53.680]  new one falls right out, so I'm doing three-hour chunks of episodes.
[00:53.680 --> 00:56.840]  Three hours is about as long as my recording software wants to handle.
[00:56.840 --> 01:01.320]  It's about the biggest file you guys can download into your phones without messing
[01:01.320 --> 01:02.720]  up your data plans.
[01:02.720 --> 01:04.560]  I'm doing three-hour chunks of old episodes.
[01:04.560 --> 01:07.240]  That puts usually three to five episodes in a block.
[01:07.240 --> 01:10.840]  That way, you guys can hear the old gems, and then I can continue to put out old stuff
[01:10.840 --> 01:15.240]  on Thursdays, new stuff on Mondays, and everybody gets old content and new content, and you
[01:15.240 --> 01:16.480]  can get all caught up.
[01:16.480 --> 01:19.280]  Also, I'm posting the old videos to YouTube.
[01:19.280 --> 01:21.080]  I'm making videos as I go along.
[01:21.080 --> 01:25.400]  I am up to number 65 now, so if you want to check them out on YouTube, number 1 through
[01:25.400 --> 01:29.240]  65 is available on the Grow From Your Heart podcast YouTube channel.
[01:29.240 --> 01:32.720]  Also, let me do a quick disclaimer before we get into the episodes.
[01:32.720 --> 01:36.600]  If I mention any advertising, any promos, any giveaways, any contests, anything like
[01:36.600 --> 01:38.640]  that, that has long expired.
[01:38.640 --> 01:40.400]  All of that stuff is done.
[01:40.400 --> 01:41.760]  There are no giveaways.
[01:41.760 --> 01:42.760]  There are no promos.
[01:42.760 --> 01:43.760]  There are no contests right now.
[01:43.760 --> 01:44.920]  Nothing's going on.
[01:44.920 --> 01:46.840]  Also, the social media has changed.
[01:46.840 --> 01:51.400]  If you want to send me an email, the new email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[01:51.400 --> 01:53.880]  On Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast.
[01:53.880 --> 01:56.560]  On Facebook, it is growfromyourheartpodcast.
[01:56.560 --> 02:03.640]  If you want to find me on Instagram, it's irie__genetics.
[02:03.640 --> 02:07.160]  Irie Genetics is, of course, my seed company, my breeding program.
[02:07.160 --> 02:08.640]  Check that out on Instagram.
[02:08.640 --> 02:09.840]  I would appreciate it.
[02:09.840 --> 02:12.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, I feel like I've been rambling for a long time.
[02:12.520 --> 02:14.000]  I hope this made some sense to you.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.680]  With no further ado, here's a throwback Thursday chunk of old episodes of the Grow From Your
[02:17.680 --> 02:18.680]  Heart podcast.
[02:18.680 --> 02:19.680]  Here's episode 65.
[02:19.680 --> 02:20.680]  No, you know what?
[02:20.680 --> 02:21.680]  I fucked up.
[02:21.680 --> 02:22.680]  I said the wrong numbers.
[02:22.680 --> 02:26.680]  66, 67, 68, 69, and 70.
[02:44.840 --> 02:45.840]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[02:45.840 --> 02:50.840]  It's time for episode number 66 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[02:50.840 --> 02:53.840]  news, education, and conversation.
[02:53.840 --> 02:57.840]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a hardcore
[02:57.840 --> 03:01.840]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[03:01.840 --> 03:04.840]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[03:04.840 --> 03:05.840]  I'm your host, Rosty Jeff.
[03:05.840 --> 03:06.840]  Thanks again for joining me.
[03:06.840 --> 03:10.840]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots band for letting me use
[03:10.840 --> 03:11.840]  their music on the show.
[03:11.840 --> 03:14.840]  Big thanks to Cat Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[03:14.840 --> 03:16.840]  You guys, I'm coming to you with a solo episode.
[03:16.840 --> 03:19.840]  I'm going to talk all about my cannabis cup experience over the weekend.
[03:19.840 --> 03:24.840]  But before we get that far, this podcast is brought to you by Hy-Gro Indoor Growing Supplies.

[04:38.840 --> 04:42.840]  All right, I do have one more important thing before we can get to my Cannabis Cup review.
[04:42.840 --> 04:43.840]  The Growers Meeting.
[04:43.840 --> 04:47.840]  I've been hyping up this big Growers Meeting at Hy-Gro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[04:47.840 --> 04:53.840]  I'm a dick because I have to announce right now that the Growers Meeting at Hy-Gro Indoor Growing Supplies
[04:53.840 --> 04:55.840]  has been postponed.
[04:55.840 --> 04:57.840]  It will not be April 26th, as I have said before.
[04:57.840 --> 04:59.840]  We are working on a new date.
[04:59.840 --> 05:01.840]  I apologize. This is beyond my control. This is not me.
[05:01.840 --> 05:03.840]  I am only the messenger here.
[05:03.840 --> 05:07.840]  There's a lot going on that I'm not even sure about why it's been changed exactly.
[05:07.840 --> 05:09.840]  There are a lot of circumstances.
[05:09.840 --> 05:11.840]  So it's beyond my control to be on Jesse's control.
[05:11.840 --> 05:13.840]  We all apologize.
[05:13.840 --> 05:18.840]  But the Growers Meeting at Hy-Gro Indoor Growing Supplies has been canceled or postponed is a better word.
[05:18.840 --> 05:21.840]  So until you hear another date, I apologize.
[05:21.840 --> 05:23.840]  I sincerely apologize.
[05:23.840 --> 05:24.840]  I was looking forward to meeting you.
[05:24.840 --> 05:26.840]  I had some shit written down.
[05:26.840 --> 05:30.840]  Either way, I did write some stuff that I want to talk about on the podcast in a future episode.
[05:30.840 --> 05:33.840]  So I said we're going to talk about grow room scheduling,
[05:33.840 --> 05:38.840]  like planning out a routine and a pattern for your room so that you can have a productive room.
[05:38.840 --> 05:42.840]  I'm still going to write that out completely well, and we'll talk about that on the podcast anyway.
[05:42.840 --> 05:44.840]  All right.
[05:44.840 --> 05:46.840]  So what else did I want to talk about?
[05:46.840 --> 05:47.840]  The Cannabis Cup, right? Let's get down to it.
[05:47.840 --> 05:50.840]  I'm going to drop the music out because that's highly distracting to me.
[05:50.840 --> 05:52.840]  We'll just lower that good enough. There we go.
[05:52.840 --> 05:54.840]  All right. Let's get into the Cannabis Cup.
[05:54.840 --> 05:57.840]  I took a bunch of notes because it was a long weekend.
[05:57.840 --> 05:59.840]  I want to try to cover a few things.
[05:59.840 --> 06:01.840]  Oh, excuse me. I'm burping.
[06:01.840 --> 06:08.840]  So the Cannabis Cup was Saturday, Sunday, and Monday in Denver at a place called the Denver Mart.
[06:08.840 --> 06:13.840]  It's off of 58th and Washington or off of 58th Street, 925.
[06:13.840 --> 06:16.840]  It's at 58th and Washington was where most of the action was.
[06:17.840 --> 06:22.840]  There was no—there was a lot of parking, but it was all fucking a clusterfuck.
[06:22.840 --> 06:25.840]  It cost $30 to park in most places.
[06:25.840 --> 06:30.840]  So let me back up. We'll talk about Friday night because Friday night's when it all kind of started for me.
[06:30.840 --> 06:36.840]  You guys heard about my Morgan Heritage concert adventure, and then Thursday I went and got stoned with the reggae bands and Hydro, right?
[06:36.840 --> 06:38.840]  So that was the last episode.
[06:38.840 --> 06:40.840]  So I left you guys off on Thursday.
[06:40.840 --> 06:43.840]  Friday night, I packed up, headed to Denver.
[06:44.840 --> 06:46.840]  The weather was terrible.
[06:46.840 --> 06:48.840]  It rained the entire drive to Denver.
[06:48.840 --> 06:49.840]  That's 125 miles.
[06:49.840 --> 06:54.840]  It took me close to two and a half hours just to get to the south end of Denver.
[06:54.840 --> 07:00.840]  I drove to—Garden of Whedon had an Airbnb spot just outside of Boulder.
[07:00.840 --> 07:02.840]  It was almost to Boulder, honestly.
[07:02.840 --> 07:05.840]  I was in Louisville, Colorado.
[07:05.840 --> 07:10.840]  It was a gorgeous little Airbnb house that they got there, sweet score, but it was kind of far out of the way for me.
[07:10.840 --> 07:11.840]  Anyway, I drove out there.
[07:11.840 --> 07:14.840]  I got dabbed out with some of the crew from Garden of Whedon.
[07:14.840 --> 07:20.840]  I wanted to meet up with those guys, hang out with them on a Friday night, which I'm glad I did because they've been busy as shit since then.
[07:20.840 --> 07:23.840]  So I hung out, got dabbed out with the Garden of Whedon crew.
[07:23.840 --> 07:24.840]  Then I headed back to the hotel.
[07:24.840 --> 07:27.840]  I got kind of hungry, got kind of tired, so I headed back to the hotel.
[07:27.840 --> 07:29.840]  My hotel was super cozy.
[07:29.840 --> 07:30.840]  I was glad I got that room that I got.
[07:30.840 --> 07:32.840]  It was cheap, so I was a little questioning.
[07:32.840 --> 07:34.840]  I was kind of questioning on how it was going to be.
[07:34.840 --> 07:36.840]  It was affordable, and it was cozy.
[07:36.840 --> 07:37.840]  It was a great room for one guy.
[07:37.840 --> 07:39.840]  There was a little bed, a couch, a desk, a TV.
[07:39.840 --> 07:40.840]  I barely turned on the TV.
[07:40.840 --> 07:42.840]  I used it as a nightlight mainly.
[07:42.840 --> 07:44.840]  I got some pizza delivered, and I went to sleep.
[07:44.840 --> 07:49.840]  I ate the shit out of some pizza, some local pizza that was around there, and then I went to sleep.
[07:49.840 --> 07:52.840]  Saturday morning, I woke up kind of early.
[07:52.840 --> 07:54.840]  I got to the cup around 9.
[07:54.840 --> 07:57.840]  It was about 8.30, 8.45 when I got to the cup.
[07:57.840 --> 08:05.840]  The parking lots were starting to get full already, but there was one spot I found that was open right away, right near the gate.
[08:05.840 --> 08:12.840]  It cost me $30 to park about 30 feet from the gate that I needed to use, so I parked my car, got myself organized, and headed into the cup.
[08:12.840 --> 08:14.840]  It was about 9.
[08:14.840 --> 08:17.840]  I had a vendor wristband, so I was able to get in before everybody else.
[08:17.840 --> 08:18.840]  The event doesn't open until noon.
[08:18.840 --> 08:20.840]  Having the vendor wristband really helped me out.
[08:20.840 --> 08:22.840]  I got in at 9.
[08:22.840 --> 08:24.840]  It was kind of neat to see the Cannabis Cup come together.
[08:24.840 --> 08:29.840]  When I walked in, it was just a bunch of empty spaces with square booths and a bunch of walkways.
[08:29.840 --> 08:33.840]  The people were emptying everything out of boxes, and everyone was all frantic and moving around.
[08:33.840 --> 08:36.840]  It wasn't the smoke fest that you guys saw, that everybody that went there saw.
[08:36.840 --> 08:38.840]  It was chaos.
[08:38.840 --> 08:40.840]  People looked stressed as shit.
[08:40.840 --> 08:42.840]  Anyway, by noon, the place was packed and jumping.
[08:42.840 --> 08:44.840]  I got in early.
[08:44.840 --> 08:46.840]  I immediately started linking up with people that I know.
[08:46.840 --> 08:49.840]  It only took me a few seconds to walk in and see people that I know.
[08:49.840 --> 08:52.840]  Also, I need to give a big shout-out to Robert and Anita.
[08:52.840 --> 08:56.840]  I don't know if they listen to the podcast or not, but I have some friends that are local friends I bumped into.
[08:58.840 --> 09:01.840]  There's a big-ass line outside the cup, right?
[09:01.840 --> 09:03.840]  There was a vendor entrance, and I just walked right in it.
[09:03.840 --> 09:05.840]  Nobody asked me for any credentials.
[09:05.840 --> 09:07.840]  I never showed a wristband.
[09:07.840 --> 09:08.840]  I never showed an ID.
[09:08.840 --> 09:09.840]  I never showed a ticket.
[09:09.840 --> 09:13.840]  I walked right in that son of a bitch, right past everybody, right into the thing.
[09:13.840 --> 09:16.840]  I was in the Cannabis Cup at 9 a.m. while everybody else was waiting in line.
[09:17.840 --> 09:18.840]  I'm a kind guy.
[09:18.840 --> 09:22.840]  I'd bumped into Robert and Anita while I was in line or while I was walking from the car.
[09:22.840 --> 09:23.840]  I saw them.
[09:23.840 --> 09:25.840]  They were going to actually use a porta potty.
[09:25.840 --> 09:27.840]  I thought, well, shit, I saw my friends.
[09:27.840 --> 09:28.840]  I should call them and tell them about this.
[09:28.840 --> 09:32.840]  I invited them to come join me, and I met them over by another area that was inside the event.
[09:32.840 --> 09:35.840]  They walked around with me for a little while and hung out, so that was fun.
[09:37.840 --> 09:41.840]  Yeah, so big shout-out to Robert and Anita for keeping me company for the first part of the morning there.
[09:41.840 --> 09:42.840]  That was kind of fun.
[09:42.840 --> 09:47.840]  Actually, I knew a lot of people there at the cup, and they kind of got annoyed that every 10 feet we would walk,
[09:47.840 --> 09:49.840]  somebody would bump into me and take a picture with us and hang out with them.
[09:49.840 --> 09:52.840]  They wanted to go to Cannabis Cup, so they ditched me, which they didn't really ditch me.
[09:52.840 --> 09:54.840]  They told me they were taking off, which was cool.
[09:55.840 --> 09:59.840]  So, Robert and Anita took off and had fun, left me wandering around for myself for a little while.
[09:59.840 --> 10:00.840]  I bumped into so many people.
[10:00.840 --> 10:02.840]  Actually, I went to a booth.
[10:02.840 --> 10:03.840]  I was looking to dab.
[10:03.840 --> 10:10.840]  I wanted to dab, and I ran into Johnny B. from NoGooNonstick, and he had a cool booth, and he said, what's up?
[10:10.840 --> 10:15.840]  And his crew said hi to me, and at the back of their booth, they shared a booth with some other people,
[10:15.840 --> 10:22.840]  and these fellers, man, I feel like a dick right now because there were two brothers that looked very similar.
[10:22.840 --> 10:24.840]  I got them confused multiple times.
[10:24.840 --> 10:28.840]  I learned them by the end of the weekend, but one dude's name was Ari, and there was a brother with dreadlocks,
[10:28.840 --> 10:31.840]  and there was another guy that looked very much like Ari.
[10:31.840 --> 10:33.840]  They gave me – you can hear the parchment paper right now.
[10:33.840 --> 10:41.840]  They gave me a little – everyone's giving out their Shatter and these little envelopes, these little – I think they used to be for coin trading,
[10:41.840 --> 10:42.840]  these little coin envelopes.
[10:42.840 --> 10:47.840]  This one is labeled MOT Extractions Cheese Nug Run 1 gram.
[10:47.840 --> 10:51.840]  So they gave me this, and I've still got quite a bit of it left.
[10:51.840 --> 10:56.840]  What I'm going to do right now for you guys, for MOT Extractions, I'm going to take a dab of this Cheese Nug Run,
[10:56.840 --> 11:00.840]  and I honestly already know that I love it, but I want to take a dab of it and tell you what – oh, that's too big.
[11:00.840 --> 11:02.840]  That's not too big of a dab. Let's not do that. Here we go.
[11:02.840 --> 11:09.840]  I'm going to take this medium-sized dab on the show here, and we'll talk about some MOT Extractions Nug Run.
[11:09.840 --> 11:13.840]  This was the first dab that I took at the Cannabis Cup, so this was how I walked into the cup.
[11:13.840 --> 11:16.840]  This is what I was introduced with, so I'm going to take a dab of it, and we'll talk about it.
[11:29.070 --> 11:34.070]  All right. I took a nice, chunky-sized dab. It wasn't too ridiculous. It was good and chunky, though.
[11:34.070 --> 11:36.070]  It was a good dab. There's no cough.
[11:36.070 --> 11:43.070]  So we'll talk about the flavor. The flavor is very smooth.
[11:43.070 --> 11:47.070]  It doesn't taste like cheese to me or the strain the cheese.
[11:48.070 --> 11:53.070]  I get kind of a – there's some sweetness to it, and there's a little bit of funk to it.
[11:54.070 --> 11:57.070]  The cheese is setting in now that it's dry. My tongue is kind of absorbing it a little.
[11:57.070 --> 12:00.070]  The cottonmouth thing is kicking in. I got to take a drink, by the way.
[12:00.070 --> 12:02.070]  Oh, excuse me. Hold on.
[12:05.370 --> 12:08.370]  Okay. There's definitely the hint of the cheese in there.
[12:08.370 --> 12:11.370]  A little funk, a little sour. I like it.
[12:11.370 --> 12:14.370]  I'm definitely going to smoke the rest of this ground that they gave me.
[12:14.370 --> 12:17.370]  I approve, you guys. It tastes good.
[12:17.370 --> 12:20.370]  I got a nice, mellow indica high. My eyes got droopy.
[12:20.370 --> 12:25.370]  The appearance, it's super clear. It's right between shatter and snap.
[12:25.370 --> 12:30.370]  I've had it for several days here. It was in my car for a day, and it's still stable.
[12:30.370 --> 12:34.370]  It still looks good. I approve, you guys. I will give a positive thumbs-up shout-out.
[12:34.370 --> 12:39.370]  This is Rost and Jeff approved MOT Extractions Cheese Nugget Run.
[12:39.370 --> 12:42.370]  So check those guys out. Find them on Instagram or something.
[12:42.370 --> 12:46.370]  I will after the show. I'll follow you guys after the show now that I approve of your product.
[12:46.370 --> 12:49.370]  They were super kind to me. Big shout-out for all the morning dabs.
[12:49.370 --> 12:53.370]  Let me find my notes I took here. I honestly have notes because I'm trying to cover all this stuff.
[12:53.370 --> 12:57.370]  Here we go. We got there.
[12:57.370 --> 13:00.370]  Oh, so yeah. Here we go. Eventually, I bumped into my friend Jay.
[13:00.370 --> 13:02.370]  What's up, Jay? I hope you're listening to this episode.
[13:02.370 --> 13:06.370]  Shout-out to at Dreadful Jay on Instagram. That's my buddy there, one of my best friends.
[13:06.370 --> 13:10.370]  Everybody thought that was my girlfriend. No offense to Jay. She's not my girlfriend.
[13:10.370 --> 13:13.370]  That's just one of my best friends.
[13:13.370 --> 13:15.370]  She lives in Cali, and I live in Colorado.
[13:15.370 --> 13:18.370]  That'd be awkward to have a girlfriend so far away.
[13:18.370 --> 13:21.370]  Honestly, if she stays, my friend will be best friends forever, so we can't fuck that up.
[13:21.370 --> 13:24.370]  Anyway, shout-out to Jay. Eventually, I bumped into her.
[13:24.370 --> 13:27.370]  Bumped into her shit. She ran from across the cup and tackled hugged me.
[13:27.370 --> 13:30.370]  She jumped up and latched up onto me and gave me the biggest, sweetest hug.
[13:30.370 --> 13:33.370]  I haven't seen her in a year, so it was great to get that hug.
[13:33.370 --> 13:36.370]  What's up, Mama? I miss you already. She's only been gone for a few days.
[13:36.370 --> 13:40.370]  So Jay and I raged the cup for most of the first day together.
[13:40.370 --> 13:43.370]  I walked around selling seeds. I took a box of seeds.
[13:44.370 --> 13:48.370]  I wore an IRIE Genetics t-shirt and put my dreadlocks down and just walked with my box of seeds.
[13:48.370 --> 13:51.370]  I sold plenty of packs of seeds that way. It was kind of nice.
[13:51.370 --> 13:55.370]  I did spend some time at the Sour Seeds booth. Shout-out to Rob at the Sour Seed Co.
[13:55.370 --> 13:57.370]  Shout-out to Rusty at CannaVenture.
[13:57.370 --> 14:04.370]  The first day, I spent some time at that booth. It was great, but honestly, I had more seed sales by walking around,
[14:04.370 --> 14:07.370]  and I got to see more people, so I abandoned the booth idea and just went and mingled.
[14:07.370 --> 14:09.370]  It was a great time.
[14:09.370 --> 14:12.370]  I also got a lot of compliments on the podcast. That was really cool.
[14:12.370 --> 14:16.370]  I expected more reaction to the seeds and whatnot.
[14:16.370 --> 14:20.370]  I thought people would be more interested in my beans, but a lot of people knew who I was because of the podcast.
[14:20.370 --> 14:27.370]  So it's kind of neat that this podcast has reached the same amount of notoriety as the seed company.
[14:27.370 --> 14:30.370]  Where am I? I'm not even using the notes anymore.
[14:30.370 --> 14:35.370]  I'm just fucking rambling to tell you the truth, trying to talk about my show or talk about my experience on the show.
[14:35.370 --> 14:37.370]  Yeah, I am reading notes and talking. Now I got to stop doing that.
[14:37.370 --> 14:39.370]  So I headed back to the hotel. Let's see. Where am I?
[14:39.370 --> 14:41.370]  Got a lot of compliments on the podcast.
[14:41.370 --> 14:45.370]  So after the Cannabis Cup, it got cold. Yes, that's where I was. It got fucking cold, you guys.
[14:45.370 --> 14:47.370]  All weekend, the weather kept changing.
[14:47.370 --> 14:49.370]  So it got cold. This is Saturday night.
[14:49.370 --> 14:52.370]  So I headed back to the hotel room to warm up, get some food.
[14:52.370 --> 14:56.370]  I ate some of that pizza that I had left over from the night before. That was pretty dang delicious.
[14:56.370 --> 15:02.370]  I actually took a couple fatty dabs and fell asleep for a couple hours because I got a sunburn. I was up early.
[15:02.370 --> 15:05.370]  But after that, I woke up and I headed to a private party.
[15:05.370 --> 15:08.370]  There was a private party outside the Oriental Theater.
[15:08.370 --> 15:13.370]  And so we weren't able to smoke in the theater.
[15:13.370 --> 15:17.370]  I never even made it inside the theater. Honestly, it was loud as shit and crowded.
[15:17.370 --> 15:25.370]  But we weren't able to smoke in there because the fire department, the police and the MED were all doing random inspections on clubs that weekend to see who was smoking.
[15:25.370 --> 15:29.370]  Because they knew people were going to be smoking in clubs and it's illegal to smoke in places.
[15:29.370 --> 15:31.370]  So we weren't allowed to smoke in there.
[15:32.370 --> 15:34.370]  We found a way around it.
[15:34.370 --> 15:37.370]  And I guess since the party's over, excuse me, I'm burping.
[15:37.370 --> 15:39.370]  I guess since the party's over, I could blow up the spa.
[15:39.370 --> 15:41.370]  This is how we did it.
[15:41.370 --> 15:44.370]  Outside the theater, these people parked two tour buses.
[15:44.370 --> 15:46.370]  One of the tour buses had a private party.
[15:46.370 --> 15:50.370]  And since the bus is private, nobody can come in and tell us that we can't smoke there.
[15:50.370 --> 15:54.370]  The cops aren't even welcome on the bus without a warrant or unless a crime happens in there.
[15:54.370 --> 15:59.370]  The fire department has no damn reason and the MED is definitely not coming on a private tour bus.
[16:00.370 --> 16:03.370]  Some of our friends, I don't want to say their names, but big shout out for you guys listening to this show.
[16:03.370 --> 16:06.370]  That was fucking smooth of you to pull it off that way.
[16:06.370 --> 16:08.370]  They set up tour buses and we just went up on the tour buses.
[16:08.370 --> 16:09.370]  You had to be kind of invited.
[16:09.370 --> 16:10.370]  You had to know what was up.
[16:10.370 --> 16:13.370]  I got a Facebook and a text message saying, hey, bro, this is where we are.
[16:13.370 --> 16:14.370]  We're on these buses.
[16:14.370 --> 16:16.370]  So we went up on the bus, dabbed out in one.
[16:16.370 --> 16:18.370]  There was a bong going.
[16:18.370 --> 16:21.370]  One tour bus was set up like a party bus.
[16:21.370 --> 16:22.370]  There was a bong going around.
[16:22.370 --> 16:23.370]  People were serving drinks.
[16:23.370 --> 16:24.370]  There was a full-on DJ.
[16:24.370 --> 16:25.370]  That was pretty dink.
[16:26.370 --> 16:32.370]  The other bus was being used for a private breeders only seed swap type of event.
[16:32.370 --> 16:34.370]  I got to go in there and meet a bunch of breeders.
[16:34.370 --> 16:36.370]  A lot of like dark horse genetics was in there.
[16:36.370 --> 16:43.370]  The guy that just bred the cherry Afghan, man, I wish I could remember your name because that shit smelled delicious, bro.
[16:43.370 --> 16:44.370]  That guy was in there.
[16:44.370 --> 16:46.370]  A lot of people were in there.
[16:46.370 --> 16:50.370]  So people were just swapping seeds and there's a little seed sales going on in there.
[16:50.370 --> 16:52.370]  That was great, but it got kind of late.
[16:53.370 --> 16:55.370]  I got to give some of my seeds to some really respectful people.
[16:55.370 --> 17:01.370]  Mr. Spliff of cannabis has some or Mr. Spliff of now he's of Gage Green, but Mr. Spliff has some of my beans now.
[17:01.370 --> 17:03.370]  He'll be growing that stuff.
[17:03.370 --> 17:04.370]  It got late.
[17:04.370 --> 17:09.370]  So I went back to my hotel to gear up for day two because this was only the first day of the cup, you guys.
[17:09.370 --> 17:11.370]  I got to meet up with a lot of people.
[17:11.370 --> 17:13.370]  I got to hang out with TaskRock.
[17:13.370 --> 17:17.370]  I don't even want to list all the people that I saw because I will forget more people than I remembered.
[17:17.370 --> 17:19.370]  It was a huge weekend.
[17:19.370 --> 17:20.370]  I got a sunburn.
[17:20.370 --> 17:21.370]  I got dabbed out.
[17:21.370 --> 17:25.370]  And I recently had a head injury and I feel like I don't remember as much shit as I should.
[17:25.370 --> 17:30.370]  But for Sunday, I slept in a little because I wore myself out Saturday.
[17:30.370 --> 17:31.370]  I definitely was exhausted.
[17:31.370 --> 17:32.370]  I slept in a little.
[17:32.370 --> 17:34.370]  I headed to the cup around lunchtime.
[17:34.370 --> 17:36.370]  I got smart.
[17:36.370 --> 17:38.370]  I went to the grocery store and got a bunch of fruit.
[17:38.370 --> 17:45.370]  And since I had the vendor wristband, I was able to take some fruit and some healthy drinks into my backpack with me and sneak those in because I didn't have a security thing to go through.
[17:45.370 --> 17:47.370]  All the normal people had to go through security.
[17:47.370 --> 17:49.370]  I got the little VIP vendor pass.
[17:49.370 --> 17:50.370]  I just got to walk right past all that shit.
[17:50.370 --> 17:52.370]  That was awesome.
[17:52.370 --> 17:54.370]  Dude, that dab is working, by the way.
[17:54.370 --> 17:57.370]  That cheese nugget is definitely kicking in.
[17:57.370 --> 18:02.370]  So, yeah, I slept in a little, took some fruit with me, so I had some food.
[18:02.370 --> 18:04.370]  It took me about an hour to park that day.
[18:04.370 --> 18:09.370]  From the time I got to the 58th Street exit, traffic was already backed up on the exit.
[18:09.370 --> 18:14.370]  And it took me 15 minutes to get from the exit to the parking areas.
[18:14.370 --> 18:18.370]  And then I had to drive around for another 20 or 30 to find a parking spot.
[18:18.370 --> 18:20.370]  And the parking cost me 20 or 30 bucks each day.
[18:20.370 --> 18:24.370]  So, I got into the cup.
[18:24.370 --> 18:27.370]  I wandered around, and then eventually I bumped into Jay again.
[18:27.370 --> 18:33.370]  Her and I walked around the cup and bumped into a bunch of friends until we decided we needed some serious dabs.
[18:33.370 --> 18:40.370]  At the Cannabis Cup, you'd think there's a lot of places to hang out and take some dabs, but there was really not a lot of comfy places to just chill out and smoke.
[18:40.370 --> 18:43.370]  There are some VIP areas and shit, but they fill up quickly.
[18:44.370 --> 18:51.370]  So, my friend Jay and I, Julie, we found a loading dock area, and we made a little dab area for ourselves and got comfy there.
[18:51.370 --> 18:55.370]  And just dabbed out and took a bunch of selfies and had a good time for a few.
[18:55.370 --> 18:57.370]  So, Sunday was a really fun day. It was more relaxed than Saturday.
[18:57.370 --> 19:01.370]  Saturday was kind of crowded. It was kind of hustle and bustle because everyone's trying to meet up with all their friends.
[19:01.370 --> 19:05.370]  It's like the first day of school. I haven't seen a lot of those people in close to a year, if not a year.
[19:05.370 --> 19:11.370]  So, I was mostly bumping into friends and hanging out with Jay until the evening when we headed to the awards ceremony.
[19:12.370 --> 19:15.370]  Let's see. Yeah, the awards ceremony was Saturday night, sir.
[19:15.370 --> 19:18.370]  It was a three-day event, so I'm confused by that. I get fucked up on that all the time.
[19:18.370 --> 19:22.370]  Usually, you do the awards at the last day, but they didn't, which we'll talk about something on that also.
[19:22.370 --> 19:29.370]  So, until the awards ceremony, the highlight of my day was probably hanging out and eating lunch with Addison DeMora.
[19:29.370 --> 19:37.370]  The lines were really long at all the food trucks, but there's one food truck that serves organic, gluten-free food.
[19:37.370 --> 19:42.370]  It's funny because there's chicken legs, hot dogs, burgers, french fries, all kinds of food trucks.
[19:42.370 --> 19:47.370]  Then, in the middle, there's this one little baby blue food truck that sells salads for $9.
[19:47.370 --> 19:54.370]  I got a salad with some chopped up strawberries and some blueberries and some fruit that I couldn't identify.
[19:54.370 --> 19:56.370]  It was delicious. It was good. I just don't know what the hell it was.
[19:56.370 --> 19:59.370]  Then, in the bottom, there were chunks of feta.
[19:59.370 --> 20:04.370]  Then, every time I stirred it, I found another layer of goodness in there, but there was honey all over it for dressing.
[20:05.370 --> 20:09.370]  It was $9, but that was the most edible stuff.
[20:09.370 --> 20:12.370]  I'm a vegetarian, and I try to eat well, so that was the most edible stuff there.
[20:12.370 --> 20:17.370]  So, that line was two people long. There's two people in front of me, and I had my food in less than five minutes.
[20:17.370 --> 20:27.370]  Jay wanted some food from another cart, and she waited in line for the entire time that I was in line, plus the time that I ate my food, plus a little bit longer.
[20:27.370 --> 20:33.370]  Some people walked by and saw me at a table, and I was sitting at a table where four people could fit, and they saw me there by myself.
[20:33.370 --> 20:36.370]  They were like, hey, dude, can we eat with you? I was like, well, shit, yeah, you've got plenty of time.
[20:36.370 --> 20:43.370]  Those people ate their meals, cleaned up after themselves, shook my hand, said goodbye, and took off before Jay even got her food.
[20:43.370 --> 20:45.370]  That's how long some of the food lines were.
[20:45.370 --> 20:54.370]  Since I'm sitting by the organic food truck eating my food, my buddy Addison DeMora walked up and sat down or ordered food at the food truck.
[20:54.370 --> 20:56.370]  Then, after that, he came and sat down with me.
[20:56.370 --> 21:01.370]  I think having lunch with Addie might have been my highlight of my afternoon up until the awards ceremony.
[21:01.370 --> 21:05.370]  Addison is a busy man, and it seems like everybody at the Cannabis Cup knew him.
[21:05.370 --> 21:13.370]  Getting an hour out of his life for him to just sit down and hang out, not talk business, to just be my bro for an hour and hang out and catch up was really an honor.
[21:13.370 --> 21:15.370]  Shout out to Addison. I hope you get to hear this, bro.
[21:15.370 --> 21:21.370]  After a bunch of dabs with Addison and dabbed so hard, and Julie joined us at the table, we made another friend at the table, too.
[21:21.370 --> 21:23.370]  I cannot remember her name. Her name might have been Elise.
[21:23.370 --> 21:26.370]  Yeah, it was. Her name was Elise.
[21:26.370 --> 21:29.370]  She was a medical cannabis user, and she uses cannabis for several reasons.
[21:29.370 --> 21:31.370]  She was just waiting for her friend in line also.
[21:31.370 --> 21:33.370]  She sat down and ate with me.
[21:33.370 --> 21:38.370]  Since she ate with me, when she was done, I gave her some dabs just like the rest of the crew, and she really appreciated it.
[21:38.370 --> 21:40.370]  I misjudged that lady.
[21:40.370 --> 21:44.370]  She was—I don't even want to guess how old she was.
[21:44.370 --> 21:49.370]  She was older than me, and she seemed all nice and kind, but she took a dab like a fucking champ.
[21:49.370 --> 21:51.370]  Dude, I should have given her larger dabs.
[21:51.370 --> 21:53.370]  It was pretty funny.
[21:53.370 --> 21:57.370]  After the bunch of dabs and shit, it was time for the awards ceremony.
[21:57.370 --> 21:59.370]  The awards ceremony was really neat.
[21:59.370 --> 22:01.370]  It's kind of chaos like High Times always is.
[22:01.370 --> 22:03.370]  The first award, they made a mistake.
[22:03.370 --> 22:10.370]  They announced the third place is the first place, and the first place is the third place, and it was already chaos, but that's how High Times likes to do shit.
[22:10.370 --> 22:12.370]  So, they finally got their shit together.
[22:12.370 --> 22:16.370]  Vader won the first three awards.
[22:16.370 --> 22:21.370]  We'll talk about that in a minute, but one thing that really stood out to me was when High Times brought out two members
[22:21.370 --> 22:24.370]  of the Jamaican Ganja Farmers Association.
[22:24.370 --> 22:37.370]  One guy was—he had short hair and wore a jacket, and then the other guy was taller and had dreadlocks to his ass, and he was the representative of the Rasta community.
[22:37.370 --> 22:47.370]  These guys spoke about legalization in Jamaica, and they announced that the High Times would be hosting a Cannabis Cup on the island of Jamaica in November.
[22:47.370 --> 22:52.370]  I'm thinking about going, but honestly, I don't know if I want to travel to Jamaica for a Cannabis Cup.
[22:52.370 --> 22:58.370]  It might not be the most financially sound idea, but you got to do what you got to do sometimes.
[22:58.370 --> 22:59.370]  I'll think about it.
[22:59.370 --> 23:01.370]  I've got a lot of things I'm thinking about.
[23:01.370 --> 23:07.370]  One thing I thought was funny, when the Jamaican came out, the Jamaican guy, the Rasta, started speaking.
[23:07.370 --> 23:16.370]  He said, greetings in the name of the Most High, His Imperial Majesty King Haile Selassie, I, the First, Jah, and all of the Rastas in the room yelled, Rastafari.
[23:17.370 --> 23:21.370]  A guy behind me bumped his buddy on the shoulder and said, what did he just say?
[23:21.370 --> 23:25.370]  I jokingly turned back and politely said, he said, hello.
[23:25.370 --> 23:30.370]  I thought it was pretty funny because the dude behind me had no idea what this old Rasta man just said.
[23:30.370 --> 23:37.370]  I was really excited to see a Rasta man come out at the Cannabis Cup and tell me that there's going to be a Cannabis Cup in Jamaica in November.
[23:37.370 --> 23:38.370]  That was kind of neat.
[23:38.370 --> 23:42.370]  Just to see some true Rastas come out and get to celebrate Rastafari at the Cannabis Cup was nice also.
[23:42.370 --> 23:45.370]  Let's talk about the awards.
[23:45.370 --> 23:46.370]  Here we go.
[23:46.370 --> 23:54.370]  I'm proud as fuck to announce that Spencer and Maddie from the Garden of Weden won first place for best CBD concentrate at the Cannabis Cup.
[23:54.370 --> 23:55.370]  That's it.
[23:55.370 --> 23:59.370]  That means we've had a Cannabis Cup winner on this podcast now.
[23:59.370 --> 24:01.370]  Yeah.
[24:01.370 --> 24:10.370]  The first female to come to record at my house and be on the podcast is also a Cannabis Cup winner in the CBD extract category.
[24:10.370 --> 24:12.370]  I'm proud as shit for my crew, to tell you the truth.
[24:13.370 --> 24:14.370]  I had that head wound, right?
[24:14.370 --> 24:16.370]  I didn't feel good for a few days.
[24:16.370 --> 24:19.370]  I went to Spencer's to go kick back just to get away.
[24:19.370 --> 24:21.370]  He had just made the cup entry.
[24:21.370 --> 24:22.370]  He's like, try this, dog.
[24:22.370 --> 24:24.370]  It's my CBD entry.
[24:24.370 --> 24:27.370]  I hit it, and it tasted like I'd just bit into oranges.
[24:27.370 --> 24:31.370]  It tasted like I had a mouthful of delicious sweet oranges.
[24:31.370 --> 24:33.370]  I'm drooling now, and I kind of want an orange because of this.
[24:33.370 --> 24:38.370]  I blew it out, and I had had a concussion.
[24:38.370 --> 24:40.370]  It felt like I had a belt tied around my head.
[24:40.370 --> 24:41.370]  It felt like just pressure around my head.
[24:41.370 --> 24:46.370]  When I blew out this dab, it felt like you undid the belt a couple of notches.
[24:46.370 --> 24:53.370]  Then he gave me a couple of more dabs, and I looked at him, and I was like, bro, I am the most comfortable right now that I have been in several days.
[24:53.370 --> 24:56.370]  I was in pain, and my head hurt, and I wasn't feeling right.
[24:56.370 --> 24:59.370]  Those dabs set me right, dude.
[24:59.370 --> 25:04.370]  He told me, he said, you look like you're the best you've been in a few days.
[25:04.370 --> 25:06.370]  I guess people could physically see that I didn't feel good.
[25:06.370 --> 25:08.370]  I didn't realize I was showing it.
[25:09.370 --> 25:11.370]  Those dabs were amazing.
[25:11.370 --> 25:13.370]  They definitely helped me out.
[25:13.370 --> 25:14.370]  Big shout out to Spence.
[25:14.370 --> 25:16.370]  Big shout out to Maddie.
[25:16.370 --> 25:19.370]  Much love to the entire squad at the Garden of Wheaton.
[25:19.370 --> 25:23.370]  Big Mike, Fong, Sloppy, everybody, Soraka, Nana, everybody over there.
[25:23.370 --> 25:24.370]  I love all you guys.
[25:24.370 --> 25:25.370]  I'm super fucking proud of you guys.
[25:25.370 --> 25:31.370]  I haven't had a chance to visit them since the Cannabis Cup victory, but I'm sure I'll get them on the show.
[25:31.370 --> 25:35.370]  Spence, if you're listening, bro, you know you got to come be on the podcast.
[25:35.370 --> 25:38.370]  I haven't even bothered them about it yet, you guys, because it's only been a few days after the Cup.
[25:38.370 --> 25:42.370]  Everyone's just getting home, getting back to our normal routines, getting our dogs loved on,
[25:42.370 --> 25:46.370]  getting our plants caught up, catching up with all of our friends here back where we live and shit.
[25:46.370 --> 25:48.370]  I'll get them on the show.
[25:48.370 --> 25:49.370]  I will get them on the show.
[25:49.370 --> 25:53.370]  The second place in the same category, I'm kind of proud of this, went to our friends,
[25:53.370 --> 25:58.370]  Joey and Shelley at Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers in Colorado Springs with their CBD entry.
[25:58.370 --> 26:02.370]  I have it on a screen far away here.
[26:02.370 --> 26:04.370]  I'm going to tell you what they entered.
[26:04.370 --> 26:07.370]  I'm going to press pause for a second, and I'm going to pull up the winners here.
[26:07.370 --> 26:09.370]  My computer is kind of far out of reach.
[26:09.370 --> 26:10.370]  All right, I got the article here.
[26:10.370 --> 26:11.370]  Sorry, I had to reach for it.
[26:11.370 --> 26:19.370]  The second place winner in the best CBD concentrate went to Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers with their Cannatonic,
[26:19.370 --> 26:21.370]  which actually is a great strain.
[26:21.370 --> 26:26.370]  If you listen to the episode I did with Angela about CBD medicine, Cannatonic might have been the culprit there.
[26:26.370 --> 26:28.370]  That was the high CBD medicine.
[26:28.370 --> 26:31.370]  So big shout out to Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers.
[26:31.370 --> 26:33.370]  I'll tell you the third place since we're on the whole category.
[26:33.370 --> 26:38.370]  It was Industrial Hemp CBD Extract with, oh, that looks crazy, dude.
[26:38.370 --> 26:46.370]  It's Isodiol SA, and it doesn't look like any cannabis product ever.
[26:46.370 --> 26:50.370]  It looks like white powdery substances that I don't even want to tell you what it looks like.
[26:50.370 --> 26:51.370]  It looks like drugs, dude.
[26:51.370 --> 26:54.370]  If you showed up with that, you put that on my table, I'd tell you to fucking leave.
[26:54.370 --> 26:55.370]  That's funny.
[26:55.370 --> 27:00.370]  All right, so big shout out to Joey and Shelley at the Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers.
[27:00.370 --> 27:04.370]  Also, I need to give a huge big shout out to my friend Noah at Champion Cannabis.
[27:04.370 --> 27:05.370]  Let's see what they actually call themselves.
[27:05.370 --> 27:09.370]  I know they go by Champion Cannabis, but their Dispensary One is a different name.
[27:09.370 --> 27:10.370]  I'm scrolling up through that.
[27:10.370 --> 27:12.370]  This article is long.
[27:12.370 --> 27:13.370]  Let's see.
[27:13.370 --> 27:15.370]  Do you just want me to read all of them?
[27:15.370 --> 27:16.370]  Let's see.
[27:16.370 --> 27:20.370]  We're just going to go through and read all of the winners of the 2015 High Times US Cannabis Cup in Denver.
[27:20.370 --> 27:21.370]  Here it goes.
[27:21.370 --> 27:22.370]  I'm going to go kind of quickly.
[27:22.370 --> 27:25.370]  Best, Colorado, Sativa Flower.
[27:25.370 --> 27:28.370]  First place, Ghost Train Haze from Green Man Cannabis.
[27:28.370 --> 27:30.370]  Second place, Sweet Silver Haze from Rocky Mountain High.
[27:30.370 --> 27:33.370]  Third place, Poodie Tang from Star Buds.
[27:33.370 --> 27:38.370]  And I'm reading this all off the High Times website, so if anything goes wrong, excuse me, it's on them.
[27:38.370 --> 27:40.370]  Best, US Sativa Flower.
[27:40.370 --> 27:44.370]  First place, Ghost Train Haze number 13, Greenway Las Vegas.
[27:44.370 --> 27:45.370]  That's my friend Noah.
[27:45.370 --> 27:49.370]  Shout out to Noah, Champion Cannabis, Greenway Las Vegas.
[27:49.370 --> 27:52.370]  We'll hear more of that, more of them as we go through these winners.
[27:52.370 --> 27:56.370]  So second place, Veganic Strawberry Cough, private stock for Buds and Roses of LA.
[27:56.370 --> 28:01.370]  Yes, my friend Noah beat the shit out of Kyle Cushman in the Cannabis Cup right there.
[28:01.370 --> 28:02.370]  That's what that means.
[28:02.370 --> 28:04.370]  Cushman second place, my buddy Noah first place.
[28:04.370 --> 28:09.370]  Third place was Green Crack grown by Christopher Stein.
[28:09.370 --> 28:12.370]  And then we're going to move on to the best, Colorado, Indica Flowers.
[28:12.370 --> 28:15.370]  First place, Louie the 13th from Green Man Cannabis.
[28:15.370 --> 28:19.370]  Second place, Colorado Bubba from MMJ America, the Boulder location.
[28:19.370 --> 28:25.370]  Third place, Black Fire from Doc's Apothecary in collaboration with the Ethos Collective.
[28:25.370 --> 28:27.370]  Big shout out to the Ethos Collective.
[28:27.370 --> 28:28.370]  Check those guys out on Instagram.
[28:28.370 --> 28:31.370]  Everything they do looks like fire.
[28:31.370 --> 28:33.370]  The best, US Indica Flower.
[28:33.370 --> 28:35.370]  First place, Granddaddy Purps from Herbal Healing.
[28:35.370 --> 28:39.370]  Second place, Kosher Kush from Green Wolf LA with Kush Co.
[28:39.370 --> 28:44.370]  Third place, DaVinci OG from Green Wolf LA with Ghost Crow.
[28:44.370 --> 28:48.370]  So then we're going to move on to best Colorado hybrid flower.
[28:48.370 --> 28:50.370]  They did two categories here.
[28:50.370 --> 28:52.370]  You keep hearing me say Colorado and US.
[28:52.370 --> 28:58.370]  The US means the whole United States and Colorado was limited to Colorado dispensaries is how I heard it explained.
[28:58.370 --> 29:03.370]  So the best Colorado hybrid flower was first place, Kong from All Greens.
[29:03.370 --> 29:04.370]  Huge shout out to Jessica.
[29:04.370 --> 29:06.370]  That was grown by a beautiful female.
[29:06.370 --> 29:08.370]  Make sure you follow her on Instagram.
[29:08.370 --> 29:09.370]  It's at Miss Green Thumb.
[29:09.370 --> 29:10.370]  That's a friend of mine.
[29:10.370 --> 29:14.370]  She is an awesome grower proven by her cup land right here.
[29:14.370 --> 29:16.370]  Second place, Starkiller from Green Man Cannabis.
[29:16.370 --> 29:21.370]  Third place, OGKB Cookies from MMJ America downtown.
[29:21.370 --> 29:23.370]  OGKB Cookies is a killer strain.
[29:23.370 --> 29:26.370]  The shot of it here on this website is amazing.
[29:26.370 --> 29:27.370]  Let's see.
[29:27.370 --> 29:29.370]  We're moving on to best US hybrid flower.
[29:29.370 --> 29:33.370]  First place, TST Cookies from Green Wolf and Top Shelf Terps.
[29:33.370 --> 29:36.370]  That photo of that bud is nice.
[29:36.370 --> 29:41.370]  Second place, Cali Kush Farms Emperor Cookie Dough from Green Wolf LA.
[29:41.370 --> 29:42.370]  Where'd the webpage go?
[29:42.370 --> 29:43.370]  Oh, it's refreshing.
[29:43.370 --> 29:44.370]  Here we go.
[29:44.370 --> 29:48.370]  Third place, Mega Wellness OG from The Weed,
[29:48.370 --> 29:53.370]  the wellness earth energy dispensary with nameless genetics.
[29:53.370 --> 29:54.370]  All right, that's a long title there.
[29:54.370 --> 29:56.370]  So we'll move on to best sativa concentrate.
[29:56.370 --> 30:01.370]  First place, Strawberry Lemonade Live Resin by Crockett Family Farms
[30:01.370 --> 30:03.370]  by Dabalicious Extracts.
[30:03.370 --> 30:05.370]  So that means Crockett grew that.
[30:05.370 --> 30:07.370]  That's the Strawberry Lemonade Live Resin, you guys.
[30:07.370 --> 30:09.370]  We've talked about that on the show.
[30:09.370 --> 30:11.370]  That is the stuff if you're looking for terps.
[30:11.370 --> 30:15.370]  Second place, Wonderland Live Resin Green Wolf LA with Dabalicious,
[30:15.370 --> 30:18.370]  Crockett Family Farms, and GC Rebellion Farms.
[30:18.370 --> 30:20.370]  That's a huge collaboration.
[30:20.370 --> 30:23.370]  Third place, Tangy No. 17 from Gold Coast Extracts.
[30:23.370 --> 30:26.370]  Now we're going to move on to best indica concentrates.
[30:26.370 --> 30:30.370]  The first place, Crown OG Sugar from Green Wolf LA,
[30:30.370 --> 30:32.370]  Nature's Lab Extracts and Crown OG.
[30:32.370 --> 30:37.370]  Second place, Space Valley OG Fresh Frozen from Pink House with Incredibles.
[30:37.370 --> 30:40.370]  Third place, Kush Company OG Live Resin Batter.
[30:40.370 --> 30:44.370]  Kush Company with Nature's Lab Extracts and Weed Studio City.
[30:44.370 --> 30:46.370]  That's a long title.
[30:46.370 --> 30:48.370]  The picture of that one looks crazy.
[30:48.370 --> 30:51.370]  It looks like a piece of sponge.
[30:51.370 --> 30:53.370]  Best hybrid concentrate.
[30:53.370 --> 30:59.370]  First place goes to B-Mega Wellness OG, Nameless Genetics with the Weed of Studio City.
[30:59.370 --> 31:04.370]  Second place goes to Crown OG Crumble, Green Wolf LA, Nature's Lab Extracts, Crown OG.
[31:04.370 --> 31:09.370]  Third place, Skywalker OG Kush from Dab Vader, Vader Extracts.
[31:09.370 --> 31:11.370]  Best non-solvent hash.
[31:11.370 --> 31:15.370]  First place, Cookies and Cream, Cubantech Dry Sift by Exotic Genetics.
[31:15.370 --> 31:19.370]  Hey guys, to the best of my knowledge, that was blasted by a beautiful woman.
[31:19.370 --> 31:22.370]  And shout out to Cubantech. That dude's cool as fuck.
[31:22.370 --> 31:23.370]  Shout out to the dreadlocks.
[31:23.370 --> 31:28.370]  Second place, Strawberry Bananjiland 120 to 73U.
[31:28.370 --> 31:31.370]  Yeah, we'll explain that on another episode.
[31:31.370 --> 31:36.370]  Tricomb Heavy Extracts with GC Rebellion Farms, Green Wolf LA and DNA.
[31:36.370 --> 31:41.370]  Third place, Kimbo Kush Cubantech Dry Sift, Cuban Hash Queen with Exotic Genetics.
[31:41.370 --> 31:45.370]  That's another extract ran by a lady right there.
[31:45.370 --> 31:50.370]  The best edible, Bubba Kush Root Beer 100mg from Keef Cola Signature.
[31:50.370 --> 31:54.370]  Now I find it weird that Keef Cola was a sponsor and also won first place.
[31:54.370 --> 31:56.370]  I don't think that that's fucking fair at all to tell you the truth.
[31:56.370 --> 31:59.370]  You shouldn't be able to enter and be a sponsor is my opinion.
[31:59.370 --> 32:02.370]  Second place, Afgato Bar from Incredibles.
[32:02.370 --> 32:04.370]  That's actually a hell of a product.
[32:04.370 --> 32:06.370]  If you can't eat that, taste good, you'll be high. I approve.
[32:06.370 --> 32:08.370]  Rasta Jeff approved.
[32:08.370 --> 32:15.370]  Third place, Orange Creamsicle Cream Pop from Sacred Sweets and Tricomb Heavy Extracts in a collaboration effort with DNA.
[32:15.370 --> 32:20.370]  I did not get to try that, but I have had other Sacred Sweets products and they are always delicious.
[32:20.370 --> 32:26.370]  They put out some stars, some Star of David-shaped products that are amazing. I approve.
[32:26.370 --> 32:31.370]  Best topical, Angel Salve Champion Cannabis with EvoLab.
[32:31.370 --> 32:33.370]  So those are my friends from Las Vegas there.
[32:33.370 --> 32:37.370]  Second place, High Gasm Genesis Compound and Essences.
[32:37.370 --> 32:44.370]  High Gasm, the product packages they show here show that it's an edible personal lubricant.
[32:44.370 --> 32:50.370]  There is one package that says High Gasm and the package has a green logo and it doesn't have a flavor.
[32:50.370 --> 32:57.370]  There's one next to it that is yellow or with a yellow highlighted label and it is labeled Coconut.
[32:57.370 --> 33:01.370]  C-O-C-K-O-N-U-T. Coconut.
[33:02.370 --> 33:05.370]  The third product is labeled High Gasm.
[33:05.370 --> 33:10.370]  The label is a little bit purplish and the flavor is Blueberry.
[33:10.370 --> 33:16.370]  So these are flavored edible personal lubricants that are infused with cannabis.
[33:16.370 --> 33:17.370]  So that's our second place winner.
[33:17.370 --> 33:19.370]  The third place winner was Floria.
[33:19.370 --> 33:22.370]  Guys, we talked about Floria on a previous episode.
[33:22.370 --> 33:25.370]  The packaging says Pleasure with Anne.
[33:25.370 --> 33:30.370]  So best CBD flower was Tora Bora from MMJ America.
[33:30.370 --> 33:31.370]  It's a great strain.
[33:31.370 --> 33:33.370]  I grow the shit out of some Tora Bora.
[33:33.370 --> 33:39.370]  Second place, The Nubia from Aficionado Freeborn Selections.
[33:39.370 --> 33:43.370]  Third place, Sleeping Giant from Elemental Seeds.
[33:43.370 --> 33:46.370]  And then this is where we move on to best CBD concentrate.
[33:46.370 --> 33:47.370]  We've been here before.
[33:47.370 --> 33:53.370]  First place, OG Tonic from The Smokers Club in collaboration with The Garden of Weeden.
[33:53.370 --> 33:54.370]  The Smokers Club was the sponsor.
[33:54.370 --> 33:57.370]  The Garden of Weeden was the grower and the extractor.
[33:57.370 --> 33:59.370]  That was all done by Spence, Maddie, and The Garden of Weeden.
[33:59.370 --> 34:01.370]  So big shout out to those guys again.
[34:01.370 --> 34:02.370]  So proud of you guys.
[34:02.370 --> 34:04.370]  So awesome that they live in my neighborhood.
[34:04.370 --> 34:05.370]  They put this little town on the map.
[34:05.370 --> 34:07.370]  They've only lived in Colorado for two years.
[34:07.370 --> 34:08.370]  They're from North Carolina.
[34:08.370 --> 34:11.370]  They came here with a mission and they're fucking killing it.
[34:11.370 --> 34:15.370]  So second place was Canna Tonic from Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers.
[34:15.370 --> 34:17.370]  If you have to go to a dispensary for CBD medicine,
[34:17.370 --> 34:24.370]  I either recommend the Green and Healthy Cannabis or Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers.
[34:24.370 --> 34:25.370]  Those are the only two spots I'd send you to.
[34:25.370 --> 34:26.370]  They're both medical shops.
[34:26.370 --> 34:28.370]  Those are the only places to go to.
[34:28.370 --> 34:29.370]  We talked about the third place.
[34:29.370 --> 34:32.370]  That is Industrial Hemp CBD Extract.
[34:32.370 --> 34:35.370]  So then we move on to Best CBD Edible.
[34:35.370 --> 34:40.370]  I had the honor of meeting the guy from Fox Extracts.
[34:40.370 --> 34:47.370]  This dude made a 160 milligram banana pudding bar in collaboration with Shumelt.
[34:47.370 --> 34:50.370]  And it won first place in the Best CBD Edible.
[34:50.370 --> 34:54.370]  And dude, I ate three squares of that thing and it's 160 milligrams.
[34:54.370 --> 34:55.370]  It's divided into eight.
[34:55.370 --> 34:57.370]  We're not even going to do too much.
[34:57.370 --> 34:59.370]  It's 20, 40, 60, 80, 60 milligrams of that thing.
[34:59.370 --> 35:00.370]  And I was high.
[35:00.370 --> 35:02.370]  I was pretty high from that thing.
[35:02.370 --> 35:03.370]  I wasn't like high.
[35:03.370 --> 35:04.370]  I was like rubbery and relaxed.
[35:04.370 --> 35:06.370]  I was quiet and mellow for most of the afternoon.
[35:06.370 --> 35:09.370]  Maybe that's why Saturday was so mellow for me.
[35:09.370 --> 35:15.370]  So the second place was Rocky CBD Enriched Premium Protein Bar from TC Labs and TC Treats.
[35:15.370 --> 35:20.370]  The third place was Cherry Drops Tincture from Great Lakes Hemp Supplements.
[35:20.370 --> 35:22.370]  So it goes on to Best Booth.
[35:22.370 --> 35:24.370]  First place, Vader Extracts.
[35:24.370 --> 35:27.370]  Second place, RX Green Solution and the Ethos Collective.
[35:27.370 --> 35:29.370]  Third place, The Green Solution.
[35:29.370 --> 35:33.370]  Best Product, Moxie Mix from Vader Extracts.
[35:33.370 --> 35:34.370]  Second place, Cloud V.
[35:34.370 --> 35:35.370]  Third place, Oil Slick.
[35:35.370 --> 35:37.370]  Shout out to Oil Slick for my sweet new hat.
[35:37.370 --> 35:40.370]  I got a pretty cool looking new Oil Slick hat and a new hat pin.
[35:40.370 --> 35:41.370]  I like it.
[35:41.370 --> 35:44.370]  Best Glass was from Q-Bert and Vader Extracts.
[35:44.370 --> 35:45.370]  Second place, Mothership.
[35:45.370 --> 35:46.370]  Third place, Hitman Glass.
[35:46.370 --> 35:48.370]  Best Vape, 710 Kingpin.
[35:48.370 --> 35:49.370]  Cloud V.
[35:49.370 --> 35:52.370]  Third place, Incredible Milkshake Machine.
[35:52.370 --> 35:54.370]  There are a few more things.
[35:54.370 --> 35:55.370]  What do we have?
[35:55.370 --> 35:56.370]  People's Choice Flowers.
[35:56.370 --> 35:58.370]  Cindy White from The Green Solution.
[35:58.370 --> 36:01.370]  Second place, Grizz Kush from Native Roots.
[36:01.370 --> 36:04.370]  Third place, Bubba Kush from The Clinic Colorado.
[36:04.370 --> 36:05.370]  I've smoked that.
[36:05.370 --> 36:06.370]  That's a great flower.
[36:06.370 --> 36:07.370]  People's Choice Concentrates.
[36:07.370 --> 36:11.370]  Sour Diesel Shatter took first place from The Green Solution.
[36:11.370 --> 36:14.370]  Second place, Kosher Kush Live Resin Butter from The Clinic.
[36:14.370 --> 36:17.370]  I bet that's delicious because I love their Kosher Kush.
[36:17.370 --> 36:21.370]  Third place, Orange Harijuana Shatter from Native Roots Apothecary.
[36:21.370 --> 36:28.370]  So, you guys, those are all of the winners from the 2015 High Times U.S. Cannabis Cup.
[36:28.370 --> 36:30.370]  Thanks for letting me read all those to you.
[36:30.370 --> 36:33.370]  It took me a minute and I stumbled a lot, but I hope you appreciated it.
[36:33.370 --> 36:36.370]  So, let me see where I was in my notes because I just totally got sidetracked
[36:36.370 --> 36:39.370]  and we're like 35 minutes into this podcast.
[36:39.370 --> 36:42.370]  I'm going to fix this microphone so it'll quit wobbling too.
[36:42.370 --> 36:46.370]  If I could get my iPhone to unlock, we could really do a lot more business with this show.
[36:46.370 --> 36:47.370]  Here we go.
[36:47.370 --> 36:51.370]  So, yeah, dude, that banana pudding edible that I ate was delicious.
[36:51.370 --> 36:53.370]  Not only did it wreck me, but it was amazingly delicious.
[36:53.370 --> 36:57.370]  If they gave me a bunch of those and just set it next to me,
[36:57.370 --> 37:00.370]  I would be really high because they taste too good to stop eating.
[37:00.370 --> 37:02.370]  So, shout out to all my friends that got Cannabis Cups.
[37:02.370 --> 37:05.370]  Shout out to everybody that won a Cannabis Cup.
[37:05.370 --> 37:07.370]  Yeah, I'm proud of you guys.
[37:07.370 --> 37:09.370]  It's great to be surrounded by cup winners.
[37:09.370 --> 37:14.370]  So, after the Cup Sunday, I was treated to a super tasty dinner at the Yardhouse with a few friends.
[37:14.370 --> 37:17.370]  The Yardhouse is on the 16th Street Mall in Denver.
[37:17.370 --> 37:18.370]  Go there, you guys.
[37:18.370 --> 37:19.370]  It's a super tasty place.
[37:19.370 --> 37:20.370]  The vibe is pretty cool.
[37:20.370 --> 37:22.370]  I'll definitely go back there for sure.
[37:22.370 --> 37:26.370]  I had a pizza from there, and I also had the Angel Hair Pasta meal from there.
[37:26.370 --> 37:27.370]  It was super dank.
[37:27.370 --> 37:29.370]  My friend Dean is a meat-eating heathen.
[37:29.370 --> 37:30.370]  No, I'm just picking on him.
[37:30.370 --> 37:31.370]  I love you guys that eat meat.
[37:31.370 --> 37:32.370]  Don't worry.
[37:32.370 --> 37:33.370]  I don't judge.
[37:33.370 --> 37:35.370]  He had a burger, and, dude, it looked amazing.
[37:35.370 --> 37:37.370]  That burger was like a foot tall off the plate.
[37:37.370 --> 37:39.370]  I don't know how that dude was able to eat that.
[37:39.370 --> 37:41.370]  It looked good.
[37:41.370 --> 37:44.370]  So, I mentioned Vader, right?
[37:44.370 --> 37:48.370]  Let's talk about something that I found kind of disrespectful at the Cannabis Cup.
[37:48.370 --> 37:51.370]  A company called Vader won several awards.
[37:51.370 --> 37:54.370]  They won the first three awards that were given away at the Cup.
[37:54.370 --> 37:56.370]  They had a huge setup.
[37:56.370 --> 37:59.370]  They had a place called Vader Village in the Cannabis Cup.
[37:59.370 --> 38:01.370]  It was a huge setup with a stage.
[38:01.370 --> 38:02.370]  They had live musical acts.
[38:02.370 --> 38:05.370]  They had semi-famous celebrities at the booths all day.
[38:05.370 --> 38:07.370]  My friend Adam Mill was there launching prizes into the crowd.
[38:07.370 --> 38:09.370]  He had the t-shirt gun, the t-shirt can,
[38:09.370 --> 38:15.370]  and he would fill it up with packages of Shatter and launch and joints
[38:15.370 --> 38:20.370]  and bags of weed and launch bags of weed and Shatter and joints into the crowd of people.
[38:20.370 --> 38:22.370]  People would go nuts and get it.
[38:22.370 --> 38:23.370]  So, they win best booth.
[38:23.370 --> 38:24.370]  They won all kinds of prizes, right?
[38:24.370 --> 38:25.370]  This is Saturday night.
[38:25.370 --> 38:27.370]  The Cup happened Sunday or Monday.
[38:27.370 --> 38:29.370]  This was Sunday night when they won everything.
[38:29.370 --> 38:31.370]  Monday is 420.
[38:31.370 --> 38:32.370]  Everyone's stoked, right?
[38:32.370 --> 38:33.370]  We show up for the Cup.
[38:33.370 --> 38:35.370]  Vader Village is gone.
[38:35.370 --> 38:38.370]  They have taken down their entire booth, tore down everything.
[38:39.370 --> 38:42.370]  The day after, so they win and they just take all their shit down.
[38:42.370 --> 38:46.370]  They won several awards, and they packed up at night while everyone was asleep,
[38:46.370 --> 38:49.370]  and they took off Monday before the Cup opened at noon.
[38:49.370 --> 38:52.370]  That just seems disrespectful to me.
[38:52.370 --> 38:55.370]  If you're going to come to a competition, if you're going to come to an event,
[38:55.370 --> 38:58.370]  and you're going to build a big-ass stage and make a big spectacle,
[38:58.370 --> 39:01.370]  then you win, hang out for the last day, and play with all the cool kids.
[39:01.370 --> 39:02.370]  Don't be a dick and leave.
[39:02.370 --> 39:04.370]  I just found that disrespectful.
[39:04.370 --> 39:05.370]  That's not even my event.
[39:06.370 --> 39:07.370]  Whatever.
[39:07.370 --> 39:08.370]  I found that rude.
[39:08.370 --> 39:13.370]  So congrats on all your wins, Vader, but that was not a classy move to do that.
[39:13.370 --> 39:15.370]  So let's move on a little bit.
[39:15.370 --> 39:16.370]  This leads me into Monday.
[39:16.370 --> 39:18.370]  Monday was day three of the Cannabis Cup.
[39:18.370 --> 39:21.370]  Monday was 420, and the place was super crowded.
[39:21.370 --> 39:23.370]  The weather had been sketchy all weekend.
[39:23.370 --> 39:27.370]  So at some points, I was wearing a T-shirt, and I was sweating.
[39:27.370 --> 39:32.370]  And then other times, I had a hoodie on with my hood up, and I was freezing.
[39:32.370 --> 39:34.370]  So the weather was super sketchy.
[39:34.370 --> 39:36.370]  Monday had a nice break in the weather,
[39:36.370 --> 39:39.370]  so it felt like everybody showed up for the last part of the day.
[39:39.370 --> 39:40.370]  Like around 3 o'clock, it got pretty nice.
[39:40.370 --> 39:44.370]  The place was stupid crowded for 420, on 420, at 420.
[39:44.370 --> 39:45.370]  It was crazy.
[39:45.370 --> 39:48.370]  But I got there around lunchtime.
[39:48.370 --> 39:50.370]  I milled around, said goodbye to everyone that I hung out with,
[39:50.370 --> 39:53.370]  because I only see a lot of these people once a year.
[39:53.370 --> 39:56.370]  You know, all these seed companies, all my friends from the Internet,
[39:56.370 --> 39:59.370]  we only meet up like once a year because this is where everybody is.
[39:59.370 --> 40:02.370]  So I pretty much said goodbye to everybody I got to hang out with,
[40:02.370 --> 40:06.370]  went and visited a few booths, picked up a couple of pieces of merchandise.
[40:06.370 --> 40:10.370]  Surprisingly, the only thing I really bought, oh, man, I got to give a huge shoutout.
[40:10.370 --> 40:11.370]  Did I write this down?
[40:11.370 --> 40:13.370]  This is all my other notes, so I'll skip that for a minute.
[40:13.370 --> 40:15.370]  I got more notes to read.
[40:15.370 --> 40:19.370]  I just milled around, said goodbye to everybody, ate some food, got dabbed out,
[40:19.370 --> 40:22.370]  gave everybody a bunch of hugs, hung out with Jules, hung out with Dean.
[40:22.370 --> 40:27.370]  Got to hang out with Addison, Gage Green, Mr. Spliff.
[40:27.370 --> 40:28.370]  Saw a lot of people.
[40:28.370 --> 40:30.370]  Saw a lot of cool-ass people.
[40:30.370 --> 40:33.370]  So I can't really describe it other than it's an amazing event.
[40:33.370 --> 40:36.370]  It's kind of like a state fair or any other trade show,
[40:36.370 --> 40:40.370]  but add the best cannabis and extracts on the planet and then a thousand of your favorite friends.
[40:40.370 --> 40:42.370]  That's kind of what the cup is like.
[40:42.370 --> 40:43.370]  Shoutout to Aaron Brooks.
[40:43.370 --> 40:44.370]  I almost forgot that one.
[40:44.370 --> 40:45.370]  I did not write that down.
[40:45.370 --> 40:46.370]  It was great to see you there.
[40:46.370 --> 40:47.370]  That was a pleasant surprise.
[40:47.370 --> 40:48.370]  Check out Aaron Brooks.
[40:48.370 --> 40:49.370]  He's an artist.
[40:49.370 --> 40:50.370]  He does some neat shit.
[40:50.370 --> 40:52.370]  So that was Monday at the Cannabis Cup.
[40:52.370 --> 40:57.370]  After the cup, I headed to the Mellow Mushroom to meet up with a few friends of mine
[40:58.370 --> 41:02.370]  because Doug Benson was in town doing a comedy show at Comedy Works,
[41:02.370 --> 41:06.370]  recording his next comedy special that he has titled, what the hell did he call it?
[41:06.370 --> 41:09.370]  Promotional Tool is the name of his new album.
[41:09.370 --> 41:12.370]  And I got to see him record that.
[41:12.370 --> 41:14.370]  I've kind of got some hookups at the Comedy Works,
[41:14.370 --> 41:16.370]  so I might have been sitting right in the front row.
[41:16.370 --> 41:18.370]  Big shoutout to Comedy Works for that.
[41:18.370 --> 41:19.370]  Shoutout to Baker.
[41:19.370 --> 41:23.370]  Shoutout to the whole Comedy Works crew for treating me like royalty every time I go there.
[41:24.370 --> 41:31.370]  So I'm going to leave you guys off on my Cannabis Cup recap by saying that it was a great time.
[41:31.370 --> 41:32.370]  It was great seeing everybody.
[41:32.370 --> 41:35.370]  Dude, if I got to see you there, thanks for shaking my hand.
[41:35.370 --> 41:36.370]  Thanks for walking up to me.
[41:36.370 --> 41:37.370]  Thanks for talking to me.
[41:37.370 --> 41:38.370]  Thanks for meeting me.
[41:38.370 --> 41:41.370]  I have a couple of gifts here that I should talk about.
[41:41.370 --> 41:46.370]  But I'm going to wrap up this part, and we're going to move on to a couple of other things.
[41:46.370 --> 41:50.370]  My friend Clint that has been on the show is going to show up tomorrow night and record with me,
[41:50.370 --> 41:53.370]  and we will talk about our experience at the Doug Benson Comedy Show,
[41:53.370 --> 42:01.370]  and we will also talk about a – we saw Greg Proops record a podcast Wednesday night at Comedy Works,
[42:01.370 --> 42:05.370]  and we also got to hang out with Greg Proops and N'Gayo B'Lem after the show.
[42:05.370 --> 42:08.370]  So we'll talk about that with Clint on the next episode.
[42:08.370 --> 42:09.370]  Let's see.
[42:09.370 --> 42:11.370]  I've got to jump back to the notes so I don't skip anything,
[42:11.370 --> 42:17.370]  but I think the next part that I want to do is I'm going to do a couple of shoutouts.
[42:17.370 --> 42:22.370]  So Josh, my friend Josh won second place in the Adam Dunn Show Invitational,
[42:22.370 --> 42:25.370]  which was kind of a private grow competition.
[42:25.370 --> 42:26.370]  Josh, dude, huge shoutout.
[42:26.370 --> 42:30.370]  I don't know if you listen to the episode or the podcast like every episode religiously,
[42:30.370 --> 42:33.370]  but when you finally do hear this, because I'm sure you're behind,
[42:33.370 --> 42:37.370]  when you finally hear this, dude, huge shoutout and congrats for winning at the Adam Dunn Show.
[42:37.370 --> 42:39.370]  He took second place, which is huge.
[42:39.370 --> 42:42.370]  This is his first competition he's ever entered, and he took second place.
[42:42.370 --> 42:44.370]  So you know the dude's killing it.
[42:44.370 --> 42:45.370]  I'm proud of him.
[42:45.370 --> 42:46.370]  He should be proud of himself.
[42:46.370 --> 42:47.370]  Let's see.
[42:47.370 --> 42:48.370]  Shoutout to Josh.
[42:48.370 --> 42:49.370]  We got that covered.
[42:49.370 --> 42:50.370]  Oh, take dabs and review them.
[42:50.370 --> 42:53.370]  See, that's the part I'm excited about.
[42:53.370 --> 42:56.370]  Sometimes it pays to be Rasta Jeff and have a little podcast,
[42:56.370 --> 42:59.370]  because while I was at the Cannabis Cup, somebody walked up to me,
[42:59.370 --> 43:01.370]  and this happened two days in a row.
[43:01.370 --> 43:06.370]  He walked up to me, and he handed me these little packages, and it says Electrum Extracts.
[43:06.370 --> 43:08.370]  I'm just going to pull this whole thing out of here.
[43:08.370 --> 43:09.370]  It's kind of hard to read.
[43:09.370 --> 43:10.370]  There we go.
[43:10.370 --> 43:13.370]  They're in little smelly-proof bags, and it's got the smelly-proof logo right over his logo,
[43:13.370 --> 43:15.370]  so I'm going to take it out so I can see it.
[43:15.370 --> 43:17.370]  It says Electrum Extracts, and you unfold it.
[43:17.370 --> 43:20.370]  On the other side, it says Lemon Skunk x Banana Kush.
[43:20.370 --> 43:22.370]  Contains 100% organic cannabis.
[43:22.370 --> 43:23.370]  Whole plant.
[43:23.370 --> 43:27.370]  Extracted via N-butane, N-propane mix in a closed-loop extraction system.
[43:27.370 --> 43:34.370]  And his Instagram, check this out, is Electrum Extracts, E-L-E-C-T-R-U-M, Extracts, on Instagram.
[43:34.370 --> 43:35.370]  Then it says not for use by children.
[43:35.370 --> 43:39.370]  So what he gave me here, he handed me some butane hash oil.
[43:39.370 --> 43:41.370]  My favorite thing, some BHO, some dabs, bro.
[43:41.370 --> 43:44.370]  And what he said was, I want you to try this on the show and let me know what you think.
[43:44.370 --> 43:46.370]  So here we go.
[43:46.370 --> 43:51.370]  I'm going to try the Lemon Skunk Banana Kush.
[43:51.370 --> 43:53.370]  I'm reaching for all my tools right now.
[43:53.370 --> 43:54.370]  I'm cleaning off the carb cap.
[43:55.370 --> 43:56.370]  Unwrapping the parchment.
[43:56.370 --> 43:58.370]  It's a nice, friendly portion he gave me, too.
[43:58.370 --> 44:01.370]  I've already dabbed a few dabs, so I don't remember what it weighed.
[44:01.370 --> 44:08.370]  But I'm going to take a decent-sized dab here, and then we'll talk about it.
[44:08.370 --> 44:09.370]  Here we go.
[44:09.370 --> 44:10.370]  Electrum Extracts.
[44:12.370 --> 44:13.370]  It's Lemon Skunk Banana Kush.
[44:13.370 --> 44:14.370]  Dab with me.
[44:14.370 --> 44:15.370]  If you've got some dabs, dab with me.
[44:15.370 --> 44:16.370]  Come on, let's do this.
[44:16.370 --> 44:17.370]  Here we go.
[44:17.370 --> 44:18.370]  Three, two, one, dab.
[44:28.830 --> 44:30.830]  Oh, dude, it tastes good on the way in.
[44:30.830 --> 44:32.830]  Usually you don't taste good smoke until the way out.
[44:32.830 --> 44:34.830]  That tastes citrusy and lemony on the way in.
[44:37.830 --> 44:39.830]  All right, I definitely taste the lemons.
[44:39.830 --> 44:43.830]  I don't taste the Banana Kush part, but I taste the Lemon Skunk for sure.
[44:44.830 --> 44:45.830]  And here's something I noticed.
[44:45.830 --> 44:50.830]  A lot of these Lemon Skunk strains, I've got a Lemon Skunk plant that I bred to the Golden Goat and made Lemon Jeffrey.
[44:51.830 --> 44:57.830]  And when I make dabs out of the Lemon Skunk or the Lemon Jeffrey, it makes my eyes bounce up and down a little bit for a second.
[44:57.830 --> 45:00.830]  Like when you're driving down a fucked-up, graded dirt road and your eyes just go...
[45:03.830 --> 45:06.830]  This Lemon Skunk Banana Kush dab just made my eyes do that.
[45:06.830 --> 45:07.830]  So that's cool.
[45:07.830 --> 45:08.830]  I like that.
[45:08.830 --> 45:09.830]  That's a good sativa high from that.
[45:11.830 --> 45:12.830]  I approve, man.
[45:12.830 --> 45:13.830]  So big shout-out to Electrum Extracts.
[45:13.830 --> 45:14.830]  I do approve of your product.
[45:14.830 --> 45:15.830]  That is good shit.
[45:17.830 --> 45:18.830]  Yeah, get that.
[45:18.830 --> 45:19.830]  Take dabs of that.
[45:19.830 --> 45:22.830]  If that's available somewhere, I want some more of that Lemon Skunk Banana Kush.
[45:23.830 --> 45:24.830]  That's tasty, bro.
[45:24.830 --> 45:25.830]  Good work.
[45:25.830 --> 45:26.830]  Thanks for giving me that.
[45:26.830 --> 45:27.830]  I appreciate that.
[45:27.830 --> 45:30.830]  He just walked up to me and he's like, my friend said you had a podcast and I should give this to you.
[45:30.830 --> 45:31.830]  Please review it.
[45:31.830 --> 45:33.830]  So I did that and it's awesome.
[45:33.830 --> 45:35.830]  Sure works out sometimes when you're Rasta Jeff.
[45:36.830 --> 45:37.830]  He gave me another one too.
[45:37.830 --> 45:38.830]  Should we try it on the show?
[45:38.830 --> 45:39.830]  I think we should.
[45:39.830 --> 45:40.830]  It'd be silly not to, right?
[45:40.830 --> 45:41.830]  Here we go.
[45:41.830 --> 45:42.830]  Here we go.
[45:42.830 --> 45:44.830]  This one is Rare Dankness Sativa Blend.
[45:45.830 --> 45:47.830]  So this one's just going to be straight a head ripper.
[45:48.830 --> 45:49.830]  I haven't tried this one yet.
[45:49.830 --> 45:50.830]  Unfolding it.
[45:50.830 --> 45:51.830]  Looking at it.
[45:52.830 --> 45:53.830]  It's kind of sappy.
[45:53.830 --> 45:55.830]  It's sticking to the parchment a little more than the other one did.
[45:55.830 --> 45:58.830]  Oh, but it's got a nice ambery color to it.
[45:58.830 --> 45:59.830]  Let's see.
[45:59.830 --> 46:01.830]  I'm smelling it off the parchment here.
[46:02.830 --> 46:04.830]  It's got an odd flavor.
[46:06.830 --> 46:07.830]  Kind of a lime.
[46:07.830 --> 46:09.830]  More lime than what I'm used to in cannabis.
[46:09.830 --> 46:10.830]  Oh, that's a big dab.
[46:10.830 --> 46:11.830]  Okay.
[46:11.830 --> 46:13.830]  We're definitely going to get a nice flavor out of this.
[46:14.830 --> 46:15.830]  So we're going to take a dab.
[46:16.830 --> 46:17.830]  Once again, guys, join me.
[46:17.830 --> 46:18.830]  Hope you got a dab.
[46:18.830 --> 46:19.830]  This is the Sativa Blend.
[46:20.830 --> 46:21.830]  Contains 100% organic cannabis.
[46:22.830 --> 46:23.830]  And it says whole plant extracted via.
[46:24.830 --> 46:25.830]  So a whole plant.
[46:25.830 --> 46:31.830]  Does that mean that you just cut the buds off the sticks and do like fan leaves and nugs all at once?
[46:32.830 --> 46:33.830]  I've done that.
[46:33.830 --> 46:34.830]  It's cool.
[46:34.830 --> 46:35.830]  It comes out great.
[46:35.830 --> 46:36.830]  I like to do that with my CBD medicine so you get that full spectrum.
[46:37.830 --> 46:38.830]  Just curious what that whole plant.
[46:38.830 --> 46:39.830]  They're hinting at there.
[46:40.830 --> 46:41.830]  All right.
[46:41.830 --> 46:42.830]  Take a dab with me, guys.
[46:42.830 --> 46:43.830]  Here we go.
[46:51.480 --> 46:52.480]  And that lime flavor catches me, but.
[46:58.440 --> 46:59.440]  This one's good.
[46:59.440 --> 47:00.440]  Oh, it's Sativa too.
[47:00.440 --> 47:02.440]  Because my head is just going, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[47:03.440 --> 47:04.440]  I like that.
[47:04.440 --> 47:05.440]  I love that feeling.
[47:05.440 --> 47:06.440]  Oh, yeah.
[47:07.440 --> 47:08.440]  Okay.
[47:08.440 --> 47:09.440]  Definitely both of those were smooth.
[47:10.440 --> 47:11.440]  Both of them had a nice texture.
[47:11.440 --> 47:12.440]  Both more well done.
[47:13.440 --> 47:18.440]  There's too much of a lime flavor on this rare dankness one for me, but it's just a personal thing.
[47:18.440 --> 47:19.440]  But overall, that's a great hash.
[47:20.440 --> 47:21.440]  Both of these are great.
[47:22.440 --> 47:26.440]  The only reason I don't give this one a perfect 10 is because the lime thing is not my flavor.
[47:27.440 --> 47:29.440]  The orange flavored one or the lemony flavored one wins.
[47:30.440 --> 47:32.440]  So I do give you a thumbs up on both of these overall.
[47:33.440 --> 47:35.440]  Electrum Extracts, you guys win, dude.
[47:36.440 --> 47:37.440]  Shout out.
[47:37.440 --> 47:38.440]  I like it.
[47:38.440 --> 47:39.440]  All right.
[47:40.440 --> 47:41.440]  Took care of that.
[47:41.440 --> 47:42.440]  Thank you guys for giving me hash.
[47:43.440 --> 47:44.440]  You guys gave me hash.
[47:44.440 --> 47:45.440]  That's super cool.
[47:45.440 --> 47:46.440]  I love when people walk up to me and give me stuff.
[47:46.440 --> 47:47.440]  It makes me feel great.
[47:48.440 --> 47:49.440]  Talk about the edibles I ate.
[47:50.440 --> 47:51.440]  Oh, yeah.
[47:51.440 --> 47:53.440]  So I went to a comedy show and we're going to talk about that more, but I want to give
[47:53.440 --> 47:54.440]  a shout out while I'm thinking about it.
[47:55.440 --> 47:59.440]  When I saw Doug Benson Monday night on my way into the show, I ate a Claudie Bear because
[47:59.440 --> 48:02.440]  my friend Claude the Candy Man from Sweet Snow Candy.
[48:02.440 --> 48:03.440]  Shout out.
[48:03.440 --> 48:04.440]  Make sure you check out Sweet Snow Candy.
[48:05.440 --> 48:10.440]  Claude gave me a banana Claudie Bear that was dipped in chocolate.
[48:11.440 --> 48:12.440]  And if you know me, you know I freaking love banana.
[48:13.440 --> 48:15.440]  And you also know that I love chocolate.
[48:15.440 --> 48:16.440]  So a hundred milligram edible dipped.
[48:17.440 --> 48:20.440]  There was banana flavor dipped in chocolate was the perfect fucking gift for me.
[48:21.440 --> 48:22.440]  So shout out to Claude.
[48:22.440 --> 48:23.440]  Shout out to Sweet Snow Candy.
[48:24.440 --> 48:25.440]  That edible worked.
[48:26.440 --> 48:28.440]  I was super stoned and super smiley for the whole comedy show.
[48:29.440 --> 48:30.440]  That was great.
[48:31.440 --> 48:37.440]  So Wednesday night I saw Greg Proops and I ate a 100 milligram watermelon candy for adult
[48:37.440 --> 48:39.440]  use and only says Indica on it.
[48:40.440 --> 48:42.440]  It says contains two pieces at 50 milligrams each.
[48:42.440 --> 48:43.440]  And you know what these guys didn't do, bro.
[48:44.440 --> 48:49.440]  They did not put any sort of branding on here, but you know what?
[48:50.440 --> 48:51.440]  They did hit me up on Instagram.
[48:52.440 --> 48:53.440]  So we're going to hit Instagram right quick.
[48:54.440 --> 48:57.440]  We're going to see if I have the message where he asked me if I ate the edible yet.
[48:58.440 --> 48:59.440]  All right, guys, I found him.
[49:00.440 --> 49:01.440]  His name is Ryan is made of cannabis on Instagram.
[49:02.440 --> 49:05.440]  So this dude gave me this edible and it's a Lego man.
[49:06.440 --> 49:09.440]  It was actually two Lego men, 50 milligrams each.
[49:09.440 --> 49:10.440]  And I ate both of them.
[49:11.440 --> 49:14.440]  We were at dinner at the Mellow Mushroom and I tore him open while I was waiting for the
[49:15.440 --> 49:16.440]  pizza to come and ate these suckers.
[49:17.440 --> 49:21.440]  I usually don't eat gummies just because of I'm just a picky sucker when it comes to my
[49:22.440 --> 49:23.440]  diet.
[49:23.440 --> 49:24.440]  But these are pretty good.
[49:25.440 --> 49:26.440]  They were not bad at all.
[49:27.440 --> 49:28.440]  The watermelon candy flavor was pretty, pretty damn good.
[49:29.440 --> 49:32.440]  And I liked him and I was definitely high for the whole comedy show.
[49:33.440 --> 49:34.440]  I smiled like a child for the whole show.
[49:35.440 --> 49:36.440]  So big shout out to Ryan is made of cannabis.
[49:37.440 --> 49:38.440]  Big thanks for the edible.
[49:39.440 --> 49:40.440]  Did you get me to that was awesome.
[49:41.440 --> 49:42.440]  I appreciate it very, very much.
[49:43.440 --> 49:44.440]  Let's go look at the notes again.
[49:45.440 --> 49:46.440]  I've got 80 D. We're going like 47 minutes.
[49:47.440 --> 49:49.440]  We're going to have to wrap this up, guys.
[49:50.440 --> 49:53.440]  The next episode will be Clint and I talking about the comedy shows that we've recently
[49:54.440 --> 49:55.440]  gone to.
[49:56.440 --> 50:00.440]  I am working on the grow room schedule episode that I prepared for Hydro's meeting, which
[50:01.440 --> 50:02.440]  is not happening.
[50:03.440 --> 50:05.440]  I should mention that again, guys, 47 minutes in the meeting and Hydro and our growing supplies
[50:06.440 --> 50:07.440]  has been postponed to a better time.
[50:07.440 --> 50:08.440]  We will let you know when the better time is.
[50:09.440 --> 50:10.440]  There's a lot going on.
[50:11.440 --> 50:12.440]  Got to do that in the future.
[50:13.440 --> 50:14.440]  We'll have another episode on improving your crop real soon.
[50:15.440 --> 50:20.440]  We'll also have episodes with Jesse doing outdoor stuff and more organics with Sean.
[50:21.440 --> 50:24.440]  So let's get some shout outs done and let's get out of here pretty soon.
[50:25.440 --> 50:26.440]  I owe a big shout out to Danielle.
[50:27.440 --> 50:28.440]  I owe a huge shout out to Julie.
[50:29.440 --> 50:30.440]  What's up, Jules?
[50:31.440 --> 50:32.440]  Thanks for hanging out with me at the cup.
[50:33.440 --> 50:34.440]  Also, I owe a huge shout out to Dean.
[50:35.440 --> 50:36.440]  Also, shout out to Kelso Marley.
[50:37.440 --> 50:38.440]  Shout out to the podcast at the Cannabis Cup.
[50:39.440 --> 50:42.440]  Also, everybody who walked up and gave me a high five, shook my hand, gave me a hug,
[50:43.440 --> 50:44.440]  any sort of compliment.
[50:45.440 --> 50:46.440]  All of you people that said what's up at the Cannabis Cup, I appreciate all of you.
[50:47.440 --> 50:50.440]  Big thanks to Oil Slick for the sweet new hat that looks fresh on me.
[50:51.440 --> 50:52.440]  Also, Silco Glass.
[50:53.440 --> 50:54.440]  I owe you a huge shout out for the sick new penny.
[50:55.440 --> 50:56.440]  Thanks a lot, bro.
[50:57.440 --> 50:58.440]  This thing looks really stylish.
[50:59.440 --> 51:00.440]  It matches my new hat.
[51:01.440 --> 51:02.440]  It works perfectly.
[51:03.440 --> 51:04.440]  Thanks to TaskRock for the hookups and the conversation.
[51:05.440 --> 51:06.440]  I got a sweet new nail.
[51:07.440 --> 51:08.440]  Thanks to Silco.
[51:09.440 --> 51:10.440]  Thanks to Bobby Black.
[51:11.440 --> 51:12.440]  Thanks to everybody from High Times.
[51:13.440 --> 51:14.440]  I'm going to skip a lot of people there.
[51:15.440 --> 51:16.440]  Dan Sky.
[51:17.440 --> 51:18.440]  Dude, I can't think of his name right now.
[51:19.440 --> 51:20.440]  I'm drawing a complete fucking blank on Mike's name.
[51:21.440 --> 51:22.440]  Mike from the podcast.
[51:23.440 --> 51:24.440]  Mike Hughes.
[51:25.440 --> 51:26.440]  Geez, I'm sorry, dude.
[51:27.440 --> 51:28.440]  I can't believe I just forgot your name.
[51:29.440 --> 51:30.440]  Shout out to Mike Hughes.
[51:31.440 --> 51:32.440]  I feel like a dick.
[51:33.440 --> 51:34.440]  Yeah, shout out to everybody from the Cannabis Cup, everybody that cleaned up after us.
[51:35.440 --> 51:36.440]  That place was a mess.
[51:37.440 --> 51:38.440]  Also, I met a ton of cool people.
[51:39.440 --> 51:41.440]  I really did meet a ton of cool people.
[51:42.440 --> 51:43.440]  This is serious.
[51:44.440 --> 51:48.440]  Some of the coolest folks that I met were my friends Deez and Gore, also known as Brian and Jen.
[51:49.440 --> 51:50.440]  It was a pleasure to meet both you guys.
[51:51.440 --> 51:52.440]  I wish you a beautiful future together.
[51:53.440 --> 51:54.440]  They're my friends from a chat room, oddly enough.
[51:55.440 --> 51:59.440]  I've never met them in person, but I met them in person for the very first time at the Cannabis Cup.
[52:00.440 --> 52:03.440]  They were cooler than I ever expected or could have imagined.
[52:04.440 --> 52:05.440]  Guys, it's been 49 minutes.

[54:22.830 --> 54:23.830]  What's up, guys?
[54:24.830 --> 54:25.830]  I'm sitting at the table with my good buddy, Clint.
[54:26.830 --> 54:27.830]  How you doing, Clint?
[54:28.830 --> 54:29.830]  I'm doing good, Jeff.
[54:30.830 --> 54:31.830]  What's up, brother?
[54:32.830 --> 54:33.830]  I'm hanging out, man.
[54:34.830 --> 54:35.830]  I'm going to turn down that music.
[54:36.830 --> 54:37.830]  That's kind of loud in the headphones there.
[54:38.830 --> 54:39.830]  Yeah, we're good, man.
[54:40.830 --> 54:41.830]  We're good.
[54:42.830 --> 54:43.830]  I love the reggae real loud in the ear.
[54:44.830 --> 54:45.830]  If it's too loud, you're too old, y'all.
[54:46.830 --> 54:47.830]  Let's read some ads real quick so we can get that out of the way.
[54:48.830 --> 54:49.830]  This podcast is brought to you by my friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.

[56:12.830 --> 56:13.830]  He got himself some water.
[56:14.830 --> 56:19.830]  Clint and I had the pleasure to go to a couple of comedy shows over the past week.
[56:20.830 --> 56:21.830]  You said this is coming out in a couple weeks?
[56:22.830 --> 56:23.830]  Yes, we'll put it out on a Wednesday.
[56:24.830 --> 56:26.830]  This will be like the 1st or the 29th or something of May.
[56:27.830 --> 56:31.830]  I feel it. Hey everybody, just so you know, Mother's Day, May 10th.
[56:32.830 --> 56:33.830]  There you go.
[56:34.830 --> 56:35.830]  Don't fucking forget. It's your mom. You love her.
[56:36.830 --> 56:37.830]  Yes, take a fat dad, give your mom a hug for me.
[56:38.830 --> 56:39.830]  And on Mother's Day, buy the bitch some flowers.
[56:40.830 --> 56:42.830]  That's right. I'm just thinking ahead.
[56:42.830 --> 56:44.830]  I'm helping out every single one of us stoner boys.
[56:45.830 --> 56:47.830]  It's like, oh shit, I would have forgot.
[56:48.830 --> 56:49.830]  I'm trying to at least. Maybe you guys already have it.
[56:50.830 --> 56:51.830]  Good heads up, dude. This will be out before Mother's Day.
[56:52.830 --> 56:53.830]  You guys don't forget. Don't fuck it up.
[56:54.830 --> 56:55.830]  Love your mama. That's where you came from.
[56:56.830 --> 56:57.830]  That's my sponsor, is your mom.
[56:58.830 --> 56:59.830]  That's who I'm trying to get to promote.
[57:00.830 --> 57:01.830]  Not my mom, your mom.
[57:02.830 --> 57:03.830]  Nope, everybody's mom.
[57:04.830 --> 57:05.830]  Just like, hey, Mother Earth.
[57:06.830 --> 57:08.830]  There you go. All right. That's already an awkward start.
[57:09.830 --> 57:11.830]  May 10th is Mother's Day and we get to break.
[57:12.830 --> 57:13.830]  Do you know what we're doing May 10th, bro?
[57:14.830 --> 57:15.830]  I do know what we're doing May 10th.
[57:16.830 --> 57:19.830]  Clint and I will be seeing Doug Benson hosting his podcast,
[57:20.830 --> 57:21.830]  Doug Loves Movies, at Comedy Works,
[57:22.830 --> 57:23.830]  my favorite comedy club on the damn planet.
[57:24.830 --> 57:25.830]  The only comedy club that's worth a shit.
[57:26.830 --> 57:27.830]  Unless you're going to a different one.
[57:28.830 --> 57:30.830]  Yeah, unless the next one we go to will be worth a shit.
[57:31.830 --> 57:33.830]  I love the Denver Improv, so I have to back that place up.
[57:34.830 --> 57:35.830]  That place was fucking sweet.
[57:36.830 --> 57:37.830]  Comedy Works is my favorite comedy club on the planet
[57:38.830 --> 57:39.830]  that I've ever been to. It's awesome. It's amazing.
[57:40.830 --> 57:41.830]  We get to see Doug Benson there May 10th
[57:42.830 --> 57:43.830]  and we get to see his podcast.
[57:44.830 --> 57:45.830]  Doug Loves Movies.
[57:46.830 --> 57:47.830]  Doug Loves Movies, yes. If you guys are into Doug Benson,
[57:48.830 --> 57:49.830]  check that out.
[57:50.830 --> 57:51.830]  I do need to give you a quick apology.
[57:52.830 --> 57:53.830]  Sorry about the growers meeting.
[57:54.830 --> 57:55.830]  I had very short notice that that was not going to happen.
[57:56.830 --> 57:57.830]  The growers meeting didn't happen.
[57:58.830 --> 57:59.830]  If you guys showed up, I'm in my house right now.
[58:00.830 --> 58:01.830]  It's the time of the meeting.
[58:02.830 --> 58:03.830]  We're here recording, taking dabs.
[58:04.830 --> 58:05.830]  It's about 7-10.
[58:06.830 --> 58:07.830]  Yeah, this is when the meeting should be happening,
[58:08.830 --> 58:09.830]  but I got some free time, so we came here and recorded a podcast.
[58:10.830 --> 58:11.830]  I apologize. I don't work for HiGrow.
[58:12.830 --> 58:13.830]  I don't do advertising.
[58:14.830 --> 58:15.830]  I don't know what happened.
[58:16.830 --> 58:17.830]  I don't know why they couldn't do it.
[58:18.830 --> 58:19.830]  I hope everything is cool with those guys. I love them.
[58:20.830 --> 58:21.830]  Big shout out to Burn, everybody at HiGrow, Burn and Jesse.
[58:22.830 --> 58:23.830]  I apologize. We'll get another meeting together.
[58:24.830 --> 58:25.830]  It will happen. I won't do this to you guys again.
[58:26.830 --> 58:27.830]  Let's get on with what we were saying.
[58:28.830 --> 58:29.830]  Doug Benson, we get to see him May 10th.
[58:30.830 --> 58:31.830]  I'm going to start it off by saying this.
[58:32.830 --> 58:33.830]  I really hope he does a better show
[58:34.830 --> 58:35.830]  than he did when we saw him Monday night.
[58:36.830 --> 58:37.830]  Yeah, dude.
[58:38.830 --> 58:39.830]  We went up. I took a buddy of mine.
[58:40.830 --> 58:41.830]  Jeff came up as well.
[58:42.830 --> 58:43.830]  Shout out to my buddy, Drew,
[58:44.830 --> 58:45.830]  because he'll be listening.
[58:46.830 --> 58:47.830]  Dude, shout out to my friend, Danielle.
[58:48.830 --> 58:49.830]  That's right.
[58:50.830 --> 58:51.830]  I ended up realizing I had a plus one available
[58:52.830 --> 58:53.830]  for the comedy show.
[58:54.830 --> 58:55.830]  I called her about two and a half hours before the show.
[58:56.830 --> 58:57.830]  I said, if you can get your cute little ass to Denver
[58:58.830 --> 59:01.830]  from Pueblo to the restaurant where we're all going to eat,
[59:02.830 --> 59:03.830]  I will order you food and have a plate of food
[59:04.830 --> 59:05.830]  waiting for you by the time you get there.
[59:06.830 --> 59:07.830]  You can grub down and we got to get to the show.
[59:08.830 --> 59:09.830]  I told her, please be here by this time.
[59:10.830 --> 59:11.830]  She made it five minutes early, dude.
[59:12.830 --> 59:14.830]  Shout out to a girl that got ready,
[59:15.830 --> 59:16.830]  got herself beautiful and drove to Denver
[59:17.830 --> 59:18.830]  in two and a half hours.
[59:19.830 --> 59:20.830]  Ladies, it's possible. You can do it.
[59:21.830 --> 59:22.830]  I'm proud of you. Big shout out to Danielle.
[59:23.830 --> 59:24.830]  Thanks for doing that. I appreciate it.
[59:25.830 --> 59:26.830]  I'm glad you got to come to the show with us.
[59:27.830 --> 59:28.830]  Also, shout out to your friend that you brought with us.
[59:29.830 --> 59:30.830]  Drew, good guy.
[59:31.830 --> 59:32.830]  The first time I got to meet him,
[59:33.830 --> 59:34.830]  and he seems like a fun guy.
[59:35.830 --> 59:36.830]  We have common friends, so we're definitely going to hang out
[59:37.830 --> 59:38.830]  and take some dabs.
[59:39.830 --> 59:40.830]  Yeah, you guys were talking about him.
[59:40.830 --> 59:41.830]  The funny thing is,
[59:42.830 --> 59:43.830]  we're one degree of separation from everybody.
[59:44.830 --> 59:45.830]  One degree of Kevin Bacon from every single person.
[59:46.830 --> 59:47.830]  That's the truth. That's the truth.
[59:48.830 --> 59:49.830]  Shout out to Drew. It was good meeting you, bro.
[59:50.830 --> 59:51.830]  Glad to meet you. We're definitely going to hang out
[59:52.830 --> 59:53.830]  and take some dabs together.
[59:54.830 --> 59:55.830]  I saw the picture of Drew's car ride home.
[59:56.830 --> 59:57.830]  It looks like you took a little nappy poo, bro.
[59:58.830 --> 59:59.830]  Fortunately, it was after the show.
[01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:01.830]  We got to the car, but Drew, you did pass the fuck out.
[01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:03.830]  It was hilarious to watch.
[01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:05.830]  He kept trying to lay over onto me as I'm driving.
[01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:07.830]  I kept having to shove him back.
[01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:09.830]  Get over!
[01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:11.830]  Either that or finish the job you started.
[01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:13.830]  There you go, tough guy.
[01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:15.830]  Suck my dick.
[01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:17.830]  Your car has got those big couch seats,
[01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:19.830]  so I'm sure he was just thinking he's cuddled up
[01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:21.830]  on the couch with you.
[01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:23.830]  It is the most comfortable seat you've ever ridden.
[01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:25.830]  I don't know about that.
[01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:27.830]  It's pretty comfortable.
[01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:29.830]  His car is a boat, you guys.
[01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:31.830]  You could go on a cruise in Clint's car.
[01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:33.830]  That's right. Everybody coming out for the cruise.
[01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:35.830]  We'll be going May 10, Mother's Day.
[01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:37.830]  I don't know.
[01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:39.830]  No, there's no cruise.
[01:00:40.830 --> 01:00:41.830]  I'm going to give a shout out to the Mellow Mushroom
[01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:43.830]  and Kelso Marley.
[01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:45.830]  We've made friends with this lovely waitress
[01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:47.830]  at the Mellow Mushroom.
[01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:49.830]  She is a fellow grower.
[01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:51.830]  She is an extract artist.
[01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:53.830]  She has a fucking cool dog named Zephyr.
[01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:55.830]  Shout out to Kelso.
[01:00:56.830 --> 01:00:57.830]  Shout out to Zephyr.
[01:00:58.830 --> 01:00:59.830]  I hope you guys are doing great.
[01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:01.830]  I hope you are listening to this episode.
[01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:03.830]  She told me that they listen to the podcast,
[01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:05.830]  so I hope they're checking it out.
[01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:07.830]  She's not only an awesome waitress,
[01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:09.830]  but she's a cool lady.
[01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:11.830]  I love Mellow Mushroom, too.
[01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:13.830]  That place is delicious.
[01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:16.830]  Clint's a carnivorous meat-eating freak over there.
[01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:20.830]  I am a scrawny, pussy, hippie vegetarian.
[01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:22.830]  You can agree with that, bro.
[01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:24.830]  I'm not saying nothing, brother.
[01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:27.830]  They have a meal on that menu for everybody.
[01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:29.830]  I'm completely satisfied.
[01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:31.830]  Clint is satisfied.
[01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:33.830]  We sit across the table from each other
[01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:35.830]  and belittle each other's food.
[01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:37.830]  We really do, too.
[01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:39.830]  Look at all the grease coming off your meat pizza.
[01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:41.830]  You carnivore piece of shit.
[01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:44.830]  This is all the shit that you should feed my food.
[01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:46.830]  Yeah.
[01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:48.830]  Huge shout out to the Mushroom.
[01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:50.830]  Those guys are great.
[01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:52.830]  Now we can go on to the Doug Benson part.
[01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:54.830]  We owe a shout out to Baker and Comedy Works, also.
[01:01:55.830 --> 01:01:58.830]  I happen to have some VIP preferred seating status
[01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:00.830]  at Comedy Works.
[01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:02.830]  As long as I let them know I'm coming in advance,
[01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:04.830]  they will get me some VIP seats.
[01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:06.830]  We saw Doug Benson.
[01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:08.830]  We were front fucking row for Doug Benson.
[01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:09.830]  Yeah, it was great.
[01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:11.830]  Got to see him record his comedy special.
[01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:15.830]  It was the third time they had done that show that night.
[01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:17.830]  We'll get on with that in a second.
[01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:19.830]  The show opened with Graham Elwood.
[01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:21.830]  How did you feel about Graham Elwood, dude?
[01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:23.830]  Graham Elwood was one of the funniest guys I've seen
[01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:25.830]  in a long time.
[01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:27.830]  Now, I was really fucking high.
[01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:29.830]  Of course.
[01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:31.830]  I don't remember a lot of what he said.
[01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:33.830]  I would zone out like he'd go on some rant.
[01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:35.830]  I'd just start zoning out fucking high as fuck.
[01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:36.830]  Man, it would be cool to see what the inside
[01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:38.830]  of a rainbow looks like.
[01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:40.830]  You know what I mean?
[01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:44.830]  He was still talking about something like his kid
[01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:46.830]  or something like that, something happy.
[01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:48.830]  I just went to the extra happy place.
[01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:50.830]  I guess.
[01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:52.830]  I looked over a couple times, and I could tell
[01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:54.830]  you were zoned out.
[01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:56.830]  Graham Elwood's hilarious, you guys.
[01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:58.830]  He's got a fake band known as the Whistling Banes.
[01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:00.830]  He's on a lot of podcasts.
[01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:02.830]  If you listen to that Doug Benson podcast,
[01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:04.830]  you will hear some Graham Elwood.
[01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:06.830]  He's also got his own podcast called
[01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:08.830]  The Comedy Film Nerds.
[01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:13.830]  Graham actually invited me to the LA Podfest
[01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:15.830]  in Los Angeles.
[01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:17.830]  He told me that there is a big room where you can set up,
[01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:19.830]  and everybody records their podcast out there.
[01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:23.830]  He said that if I come, he would be on my show,
[01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:25.830]  and he shook my hand.
[01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:28.830]  If I make it to LA Podfest, you guys will hear
[01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:30.830]  Graham Elwood on the podcast.
[01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:32.830]  That would be fucking cool.
[01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:34.830]  He was a really nice guy.
[01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:36.830]  I've said the F-bomb probably 15 times.
[01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:38.830]  Already?
[01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:40.830]  Yeah.
[01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:42.830]  Anyway, he said it so quietly.
[01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:44.830]  Fuck yeah.
[01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:47.830]  But Graham amazed me because he was funny,
[01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:50.830]  and he was clean, which is hard to do.
[01:03:51.830 --> 01:03:52.830]  So, just more props to him.
[01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:54.830]  He was really funny.
[01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:56.830]  If he would ever listen to this, I hope he would hear us
[01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:59.830]  say that he was the best part of that night,
[01:04:00.830 --> 01:04:02.830]  because Doug Benson came on after him,
[01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:05.830]  and Doug's first thing he said, he goes,
[01:04:06.830 --> 01:04:07.830]  I woke up this morning, I started smoking.
[01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:09.830]  This was on 420.
[01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:11.830]  Yeah, this was on 420.
[01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:13.830]  So, let's remind the people that.
[01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:15.830]  So, he woke up, he started smoking.
[01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:19.830]  He did a 420 show up until he was smoking up until then.
[01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:21.830]  He just kept smoking all day,
[01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:23.830]  and that was the first thing he said.
[01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:26.830]  He did all he could do to make it to where
[01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:28.830]  he couldn't make it to that last show.
[01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:31.830]  Yeah, his goal was to be too high to record that show.
[01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:33.830]  I think he succeeded.
[01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:36.830]  You know, I've gotten Doug Benson high several times,
[01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:38.830]  and I've never seen him that high.
[01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:40.830]  I got high, and this sounds like bragging,
[01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:42.830]  but I'm kind of, I'm not bros with Doug,
[01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:44.830]  but I'm internet buddies with Doug.
[01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:46.830]  I'm Twitter friends with Doug. We talk and shit.
[01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:48.830]  And some of the comedians know who I am by now
[01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:50.830]  because I've gone to enough shows.
[01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:52.830]  So, he relies on Rasta Jeff to get him high before the show.
[01:04:53.830 --> 01:04:54.830]  He knows I've got some dank weed, and I'm not psycho.
[01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:56.830]  So, he hits me up. He hit me up to get him high.
[01:04:57.830 --> 01:04:59.830]  One time I got him high, and he told me from the stage,
[01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:01.830]  he fucked up a joke and looked at me and said,
[01:05:02.830 --> 01:05:03.830]  you're too high, bro.
[01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:05.830]  That night, he was three or four times
[01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:07.830]  beyond that level of highness.
[01:05:08.830 --> 01:05:10.830]  He was so fucking skinny-eyed.
[01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:12.830]  You could not see.
[01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:14.830]  One eye was skinny. One eye was weird.
[01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:16.830]  I think one eye was working, kind of,
[01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:19.830]  but it was fucking, I don't know, dude.
[01:05:20.830 --> 01:05:23.830]  He was so baked that he just,
[01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:26.830]  it just wasn't even that much fun.
[01:05:27.830 --> 01:05:28.830]  He kept putting his head on the microphone.
[01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:30.830]  You guys heard this sound a lot.
[01:05:30.830 --> 01:05:31.830]  And that was his head hitting the microphone
[01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:33.830]  so that he could take a little break.
[01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:35.830]  He was laughing at his own jokes,
[01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:37.830]  and there was some really hilarious shit that he said.
[01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:39.830]  He spent 30 minutes reading fucking tweets.
[01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:41.830]  Thank you.
[01:05:42.830 --> 01:05:43.830]  The first 30 minutes of his show, he read tweets,
[01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:45.830]  which he usually spends.
[01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:47.830]  But the problem was that 30 minutes
[01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:49.830]  was only divided up by like five tweets.
[01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:51.830]  Yes.
[01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:52.830]  It wasn't like a whole bunch of tweets.
[01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:54.830]  It was like five people that were audacious enough
[01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:56.830]  to pull their phone out in a comedy show
[01:05:57.830 --> 01:05:58.830]  and send him a shout-out or a tweet at him.
[01:05:58.830 --> 01:05:59.830]  Yeah.
[01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:00.830]  We're up front row.
[01:06:00.830 --> 01:06:01.830]  I can't do that.
[01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:02.830]  No, that looks, he would've,
[01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:04.830]  Graham was staring at me because my phone was on my lap
[01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:06.830]  because it's too big for my pocket.
[01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:08.830]  I got this iPhone 6 Plus, so my phone was on my lap,
[01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:10.830]  and Graham kept looking at it.
[01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:12.830]  I felt like Graham Elwood looked at my phone twice,
[01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:14.830]  like he's got his fucking phone out.
[01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:16.830]  Maybe if it was on your lap,
[01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:18.830]  he was looking at something else.
[01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:20.830]  Was he looking at my package, bro?
[01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:22.830]  You think Graham was checking it out?
[01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:24.830]  He was trying to see if he got any seeds down there.
[01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:26.830]  Ooh, I got plenty of seeds, buddy.
[01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:27.830]  I saw Doug Benson literally yawn.
[01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:29.830]  He had to move the mic from his face and yawn.
[01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:31.830]  That was bad.
[01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:33.830]  Onstage performing his comedy special.
[01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:35.830]  He actually said,
[01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:37.830]  this is my third time recording this,
[01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:39.830]  and what I want to do is make sure to get the jokes
[01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:41.830]  that I didn't get perfect the last couple of times.
[01:06:42.830 --> 01:06:43.830]  Now, don't let me say anything other than
[01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:45.830]  I respect him for being honest,
[01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:47.830]  but I just didn't pay to go see a guy
[01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:49.830]  just kind of muddle through something.
[01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:51.830]  Right.
[01:06:51.830 --> 01:06:52.830]  Do you know what I mean?
[01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:54.830]  Yeah.
[01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:55.830]  When I go to see a concert,
[01:06:56.830 --> 01:06:57.830]  I don't want to watch Metallica do soundcheck five times.
[01:06:58.830 --> 01:06:59.830]  I don't know why I picked Metallica.
[01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:01.830]  No, no, that would be, well, I mean, maybe.
[01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:03.830]  I want to watch them nail Inner Sandman.
[01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:05.830]  I don't want to watch them try to do some song
[01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:07.830]  they haven't done right in a couple of weeks.
[01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:09.830]  We haven't played this song properly.
[01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:11.830]  We're going to try it in front of you.
[01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:13.830]  Yeah, three times.
[01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:15.830]  Yeah.
[01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:16.830]  Or I mean, Doug only did things,
[01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:18.830]  I guess he did things three times that day, though.
[01:07:19.830 --> 01:07:20.830]  Yeah, and he did a couple of the bits twice
[01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:22.830]  because he forgot he did one
[01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:24.830]  when he was doing a bit for us.
[01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:25.830]  Oh, yeah.
[01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:27.830]  Well, it's because he broke it off early in the first part.
[01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:29.830]  He didn't tell like the same part of the story.
[01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:31.830]  I don't remember.
[01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:33.830]  How high were we?
[01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:35.830]  Part of that was because he had a pocket full of notes
[01:07:36.830 --> 01:07:37.830]  that were disheveled.
[01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:39.830]  It looked like,
[01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:41.830]  it looked like your grandpa had gone to Lowe's.
[01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:43.830]  You know, when grandpa comes home from going out all day,
[01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:45.830]  he's got a pocket full of receipts
[01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:47.830]  and a couple of breath mints and a fucking toothpick
[01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:49.830]  and like a shopping list.
[01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:51.830]  And now grandpa's got a joint in there.
[01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:53.830]  Yeah.
[01:07:54.830 --> 01:07:55.830]  Yeah.
[01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:56.830]  Well, he had,
[01:07:57.830 --> 01:07:58.830]  there's like four or five different colors
[01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:00.830]  of pieces of paper in there.
[01:08:01.830 --> 01:08:02.830]  There was a receipt for Barnes and Noble in there
[01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:04.830]  that I could see like.
[01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:06.830]  I don't know if he had scribbled on all of it,
[01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:08.830]  but that's what,
[01:08:09.830 --> 01:08:10.830]  that's where his notes were,
[01:08:11.830 --> 01:08:12.830]  was in that handful of grandpa.
[01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:14.830]  And he kept staring at all of it.
[01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:16.830]  Handful of grandpa is also the name of my new metal band.
[01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:18.830]  Can we write that down?
[01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:20.830]  Because I have,
[01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:22.830]  I have a use for the name handful of grandpa.
[01:08:22.830 --> 01:08:23.830]  All right.
[01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:25.830]  Another project needs a name.
[01:08:26.830 --> 01:08:27.830]  And if you're not going to use it,
[01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:29.830]  Oh no, buddy, we're going to make something out of this.
[01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:31.830]  Guys, make sure you listen to my other podcast.
[01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:33.830]  It's called handful of grandpa.
[01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:35.830]  It hasn't been put out yet.
[01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:37.830]  Clint Stewart's the first guest.
[01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:39.830]  Yes, that may just be an episode,
[01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:41.830]  but still this,
[01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:43.830]  that needs to be written down.
[01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:45.830]  And I'm sorry if I'm wasting time
[01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:47.830]  writing down this phrase handful of grandpa.
[01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:49.830]  If you guys have made it this far into this podcast,
[01:08:50.830 --> 01:08:51.830]  we salute you.
[01:08:52.830 --> 01:08:53.830]  We're not throwing as people though.
[01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:55.830]  All right.
[01:08:56.830 --> 01:08:57.830]  Now,
[01:08:58.830 --> 01:08:59.830]  now I remember why I forget to bring comedians.
[01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:01.830]  It's just me.
[01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:03.830]  This is the shit that happens.
[01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:05.830]  No, I love it.
[01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:07.830]  I love the chaos.
[01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:09.830]  I hope the listeners like it.
[01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:11.830]  It doesn't always have to be intense.
[01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:13.830]  Grow lessons, Danielle, you can put your notebook away.
[01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:15.830]  There will be nothing to write down this time.
[01:09:16.830 --> 01:09:17.830]  Other than the phrase handful of grandpa.
[01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:19.830]  We win.
[01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:21.830]  Anyway, so,
[01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:23.830]  yeah, and then he just,
[01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:25.830]  and I think he needs glasses to go with the notes.
[01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:27.830]  He definitely needed to open his eyes a little bit
[01:09:28.830 --> 01:09:29.830]  because they were fucking closed.
[01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:31.830]  Yeah, yeah, they were closed.
[01:09:32.830 --> 01:09:33.830]  Fucked up.
[01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:35.830]  Somebody threw a joint on stage and it took him two minutes
[01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:37.830]  to find it and pick it up.
[01:09:38.830 --> 01:09:39.830]  He almost stepped on it.
[01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:41.830]  He was found it.
[01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:43.830]  He was waiting.
[01:09:44.830 --> 01:09:45.830]  And if you've ever seen the comedy works like stage,
[01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:47.830]  it's well lit and it's maybe the size of your kitchen table.
[01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:49.830]  Yes.
[01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:50.830]  Like it's, it's not a big thing.
[01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:51.830]  It's like a blue carpet.
[01:09:52.830 --> 01:09:53.830]  What did somebody say?
[01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:55.830]  The floor looked like somebody tweeted and said,
[01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:57.830]  oh yeah, a nail or a salon floor.
[01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:59.830]  Yes, a day spa floor.
[01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:01.830]  I thought that was weird, but it was vacuumed beautifully.
[01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:03.830]  It was perfect.
[01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:05.830]  Anyway, no, but it was just like 30 minutes on five tweets,
[01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:07.830]  which was kind of boring.
[01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:09.830]  Got into some other stuff and then he tried to do like
[01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:11.830]  other tweets or something like later in the show.
[01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:13.830]  Didn't he?
[01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:15.830]  Wasn't he doing tweet relief?
[01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:17.830]  Oh yeah.
[01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:19.830]  He did a thing.
[01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:21.830]  I think it was a thing that he plays on a show where he lets
[01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:23.830]  the audience members select movies and then he decides
[01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:25.830]  which one to watch, but he was too high to keep track of
[01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:27.830]  what the other audience members were saying.
[01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:29.830]  I think.
[01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:31.830]  I don't remember Matt.
[01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:33.830]  Well, it was the things called promotional tool.
[01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:35.830]  And, uh, I mean, we,
[01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:38.830]  we definitely felt like we got used like a tool.
[01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:40.830]  Yeah.
[01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:42.830]  It just, it did.
[01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:44.830]  It felt a little like, uh, like, you know what guys,
[01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:46.830]  it sucks to be you, but this is what's happening.
[01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:48.830]  And maybe that's the way it has to be.
[01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:49.830]  I don't want to say that.
[01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:51.830]  That's what all good Mike happens when we all were
[01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:53.830]  talking about it later.
[01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:55.830]  I was like, so what'd you guys think?
[01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:57.830]  And I was just waiting for someone to be like, that was
[01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:59.830]  kind of fucking whack for my 20 bucks.
[01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:01.830]  Well, like you went and hung out with Doug and then me
[01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:03.830]  and my boy drew took off.
[01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:05.830]  Yeah.
[01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:07.830]  We're all in stupidly enough.
[01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:09.830]  There were three carloads of people from Pueblo with one or
[01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:11.830]  two people in each car because we didn't plan.
[01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:13.830]  I had come from the cannabis cup.
[01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:15.830]  You came up on your own.
[01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:17.830]  And then I invited Danielle right after you left.
[01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:19.830]  And then we all had to get in separate cars.
[01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:21.830]  So once we linked up and talked about it, it was like,
[01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:23.830]  yeah, I felt like we kind of were his Guinea pigs test
[01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:25.830]  audience or something.
[01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:27.830]  A shout out to Graham Elwood.
[01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:29.830]  He saved the fucking show.
[01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:31.830]  Doug, I'm not being disrespectful to you, bro.
[01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:33.830]  I just feel like that third show, man, you were too high.
[01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:35.830]  And if I wasn't, I'm like a loyal Doug fan.
[01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:37.830]  So it was kind of neat for me to see that.
[01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:39.830]  Like I've seen enough Doug.
[01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:41.830]  That's why I'm watching my friend do comedy now,
[01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:43.830]  whatever, and I get VIP seats and shit.
[01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:45.830]  But if I was a normal civilian listener, I might not
[01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:47.830]  have been able to get in the car.
[01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:49.830]  I was really impressed with that show.
[01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:51.830]  Well, like I told you, the only interaction I've had
[01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:53.830]  with them is just listening to Doug loves movies.
[01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:55.830]  And so that's not a whole lot of Doug.
[01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:57.830]  That's a lot of everybody else.
[01:11:58.830 --> 01:11:59.830]  Right.
[01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:00.830]  I haven't watched Doug specials before.
[01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:02.830]  That was my first chance of seeing Doug Benson.
[01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:04.830]  And I was not impressed.
[01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:06.830]  I've said it on the podcast before that I think maybe
[01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:08.830]  Doug's excessive cannabis use may be slowing down
[01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:10.830]  his comedy and his career.
[01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:13.830]  And I think that our experience solidifies my theory.
[01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:15.830]  Yeah.
[01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:17.830]  Yeah.
[01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:19.830]  I think that's a good thing.
[01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:21.830]  I think that should be used as a way to move yourself
[01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:23.830]  forward.
[01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:25.830]  Well, then real quick.
[01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:27.830]  And we didn't bring this up before.
[01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:29.830]  But when when there was that, he said, we're all going
[01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:31.830]  to go smoke outside.
[01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:33.830]  And I was like, all right, cool.
[01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:35.830]  So we'll go smoke.
[01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:37.830]  There was what, like 100 people, people.
[01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:39.830]  It was like 100 people in that alleyway.
[01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:41.830]  I don't know if you guys have ever seen the comedy
[01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:43.830]  works alleyway, but it's probably 30 feet wide.
[01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:45.830]  Yeah, maybe, you know, 10 yards less.
[01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:47.830]  Well, I'm just trying to give it a little bit of a
[01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:49.830]  sense.
[01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:51.830]  I mean, if the car goes down there, we all got to
[01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:53.830]  squeeze against the side.
[01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:55.830]  Yeah, I guess.
[01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:57.830]  All right.
[01:12:58.830 --> 01:12:59.830]  So so we'll say 10 feet wide, maybe 15.
[01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:01.830]  But there was there was like 75 to 100 people.
[01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:03.830]  There were a lot of people in there.
[01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:05.830]  And and it started feeling real bro.
[01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:07.830]  While while Doug was smoking, Doug would take a
[01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:09.830]  hit of a joint and everybody would cheer for it.
[01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:11.830]  Yeah.
[01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:13.830]  As though he was like some hero like coming home
[01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:15.830]  from war.
[01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:17.830]  And this was his first like step on American soil.
[01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:19.830]  And he was like, this is it.
[01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:21.830]  Like we were doing it.
[01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:23.830]  We're outside in Colorado doing it.
[01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:25.830]  And it was just like, no, this is this isn't the
[01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:27.830]  attitude I want to have around weed.
[01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:29.830]  Yeah.
[01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:31.830]  Yeah.
[01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:33.830]  It kind of wasn't it seemed like we were taking
[01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:35.830]  tequila shots and everybody was high five or the
[01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:37.830]  tequila shots.
[01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:39.830]  Yeah, it got that way.
[01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:41.830]  Yeah, that's how I felt about it.
[01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:43.830]  I'm glad that I didn't I didn't stick around.
[01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:45.830]  I had to get home.
[01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:47.830]  I was tired.
[01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:49.830]  I was tired of being in the storm so far.
[01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:51.830]  And when the crowd saw him heard him address me,
[01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:53.830]  they fucking separated and let him and I kind of
[01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:55.830]  hang out and take some pictures and show for a
[01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:57.830]  minute and he shook my head and left and just
[01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:59.830]  wandered out.
[01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:01.830]  That was it.
[01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:03.830]  Yeah, there were still a lot of people there and
[01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:05.830]  he left.
[01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:06.830]  So I saw in Guyo at that point and Guy Obelem
[01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:08.830]  because if you know, and Guy O check him out,
[01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:10.830]  it's at his name is a hard to spell.
[01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:12.830]  It's NGA IO 420 at NGIO in Guy O 420.
[01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:14.830]  Check him out on Twitter.
[01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:16.830]  He's a cannabis activist.
[01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:20.030]  He's a comedian.
[01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:21.150]  He's a jack of all trades,
[01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:24.150]  but he's definitely a pot smoker and a pot connoisseur.
[01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:25.390]  So I bumped into Ngaio.
[01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:27.150]  We've been Twitter friends and whatnot.
[01:14:27.150 --> 01:14:29.750]  We've been in the same area, same industry for a long time,
[01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:31.030]  but I finally bumped into the dude
[01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:32.730]  and made friends with him.
[01:14:32.730 --> 01:14:33.910]  He followed me on Twitter.
[01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:36.630]  He followed our friend on Twitter.
[01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:39.490]  And then I thought that was the end
[01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:41.010]  of my meeting with Ngaio.
[01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:42.710]  I thought we had met and shook hands and shit.
[01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:44.270]  So everybody went our separate ways.
[01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:45.250]  Clint drove home, like you said,
[01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:46.230]  because he was tired.
[01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:48.130]  Obviously Drew needed a nap.
[01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:50.730]  He made it 30 minutes.
[01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:52.810]  I made sure Danielle got to her car safely
[01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:54.530]  and we all headed back south
[01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:56.610]  to the lovely city of Pueblo.
[01:14:56.610 --> 01:15:00.410]  Tuesday, I had to drive almost all the way back.
[01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:01.810]  I drove up to the North End of Springs
[01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:03.290]  to meet up with some friends for some food
[01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.890]  that we're leaving back to Cali.
[01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:09.650]  I got to introduce our friend Danielle
[01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:11.610]  to our friend, my friend Jay.
[01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:14.730]  They've been Twitter and Instagram friends for a long time.
[01:15:14.730 --> 01:15:16.130]  And they finally got to meet up.
[01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:17.830]  So I put them two chicks in a parking lot,
[01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:19.270]  let them hula hoop together for a minute.
[01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:20.110]  It was great.
[01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:22.230]  Yeah, we got to make some friends out of those two.
[01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:23.330]  Shout out to them two ladies.
[01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:24.730]  So that was my Tuesday.
[01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:27.650]  Then Wednesday, Clint met me at my house
[01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:29.630]  right around 420-ish.
[01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:34.350]  And then we boogied up to go see Mr. Greg Proops
[01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:36.950]  record the World's Smartest Podcast.
[01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:37.950]  Check that one out.
[01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:39.230]  It may lose some of you guys.
[01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:40.870]  Some of you guys may like it.
[01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:43.390]  Clint, I could tell that Clint was a little bit lost
[01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:44.990]  during the show.
[01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:47.610]  Yeah, it was either lost or it was just,
[01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:50.250]  I don't know, he gets a little ranty.
[01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:51.090]  You know how it is.
[01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:52.610]  Well, yeah, he calls that the boring,
[01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:53.570]  preachy part of his show.
[01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:55.210]  He definitely, that's his thing.
[01:15:55.210 --> 01:15:57.370]  That's a good portion of his show, apparently.
[01:15:57.370 --> 01:15:59.490]  Because there was a lot of preachy parts.
[01:15:59.490 --> 01:16:01.130]  There was some joke parts at the start
[01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:02.210]  that just take a little while.
[01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:04.210]  He's got a lot of references and stuff
[01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:06.690]  that just, it just takes a while to get to things.
[01:16:06.690 --> 01:16:09.530]  I'm more of a, let me hit you with the left and a right.
[01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:10.370]  Right.
[01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:11.850]  Well, his comedy, he's doing a-
[01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:12.930]  No, he's a smart guy.
[01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:13.770]  And I like the guy.
[01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:14.610]  And he's funny.
[01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:16.230]  Like some of the jokes he had were really funny.
[01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:17.630]  It just takes a little while to get there.
[01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:20.950]  But he's, I'm pretty sure he's like improv-ing all of that.
[01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:22.470]  All of that was improv.
[01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:23.950]  Wednesday was the podcast.
[01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:26.390]  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, he's doing standup,
[01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:28.670]  which will be completely different than what you saw.
[01:16:28.670 --> 01:16:29.710]  That's the thing, is like,
[01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:31.470]  improv is a different thing to me.
[01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:32.310]  You know what I mean?
[01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:34.590]  Like, I do standup.
[01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:35.590]  I don't do improv.
[01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:36.910]  And it's nothing against improv.
[01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:37.870]  I just don't do it.
[01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:40.110]  So I don't know those skills.
[01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:43.470]  Like those guys are better at many, many things.
[01:16:44.170 --> 01:16:45.130]  But I think just getting to the joke
[01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:46.690]  and keeping people laughing,
[01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:48.650]  that's where standup reigns.
[01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:49.490]  Right.
[01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:50.850]  And keeping you engaged and stuff like that.
[01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:53.050]  Now, improv is kind of like,
[01:16:53.050 --> 01:16:54.410]  well, let's try to figure out
[01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:57.370]  how do we get back to this neutral point or whatever
[01:16:57.370 --> 01:16:59.730]  so that way we can make it funny.
[01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:01.810]  But those guys, that's a challenge and a half.
[01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:04.090]  But the audience is a little bit more,
[01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:05.690]  gives you more leeway with that.
[01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:06.530]  Oh yeah.
[01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:07.350]  You know what I mean?
[01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:08.610]  So maybe you guys know in the podcast
[01:17:08.610 --> 01:17:10.650]  we're giving him more leeway than I was.
[01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:13.170]  Well, I'm not there just for the funny.
[01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:16.550]  I'm expecting to be enlightened a little by Greg,
[01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:20.270]  educated, slightly offended at some points.
[01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:22.310]  I know he's a thinking man's comedian.
[01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:24.710]  He calls himself the world's smartest man.
[01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:26.150]  That's a joke.
[01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:27.690]  That's just a, but it's-
[01:17:27.690 --> 01:17:28.530]  He's a smart dude though.
[01:17:28.530 --> 01:17:29.510]  He's a smart sucker.
[01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:30.550]  And he's been doing improv.
[01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:32.550]  Wait, you asked him how long you've been doing comedy
[01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:33.910]  and he just shook his head at you.
[01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:35.430]  I think he just wanted to say like
[01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:36.950]  longer than you've been alive.
[01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:37.790]  And that was the truth.
[01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:40.350]  But I was, and I wasn't trying to say like,
[01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:41.190]  oh, how long you've been,
[01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:42.710]  I was just wanting to ask him like,
[01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:44.170]  well, how long, you know,
[01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:46.730]  this is like a goal of mine to be you.
[01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:49.290]  And he kind of did kind of just dismiss me
[01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:51.210]  as though I was saying it like an asshole.
[01:17:51.210 --> 01:17:53.410]  But what I meant like was all respect.
[01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:55.330]  Like, dude, like, I just,
[01:17:55.330 --> 01:17:57.530]  I just want to know that there is the possibility
[01:17:57.530 --> 01:18:00.170]  that in like you've been doing this for 30 years,
[01:18:00.170 --> 01:18:01.490]  that's what it takes to get to you.
[01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:02.330]  Cool, man.
[01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:03.170]  I'd love to.
[01:18:03.170 --> 01:18:03.990]  Yeah, he's-
[01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.830]  That's where I want to be.
[01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:07.090]  And you guys, he's the one from Whose Line Is It Anyway.
[01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:07.930]  That's the name of the show, right?
[01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:08.750]  Whose Line?
[01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:10.290]  Yeah, Whose Line Is It Anyway is one of the,
[01:18:10.290 --> 01:18:11.810]  that's one of the shows that this guy is on.
[01:18:12.810 --> 01:18:13.650]  No offense to Greg,
[01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:16.030]  but he's probably the one that you call the gay one.
[01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:17.150]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:18.670]  He's got a beautiful wife named Jennifer
[01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:19.870]  and he is completely straight
[01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:21.230]  and he stands up for women's rights.
[01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:22.070]  So that's badass.
[01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:23.990]  He's just got like a little bit of a high,
[01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:25.270]  irritating voice.
[01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:26.110]  Do you know what I mean?
[01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:27.990]  Like, I don't mean like super irritating,
[01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:29.070]  but it's just like,
[01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:30.790]  I probably wouldn't want to marry that guy.
[01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:32.550]  Well, I'm glad you feel that way.
[01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:34.110]  I think I'm all right with that.
[01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:36.070]  His voice made it to where I didn't want to marry him.
[01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:38.270]  Nothing else about that situation.
[01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:40.550]  He wears a suit all of the time.
[01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:41.890]  He had a suit with an,
[01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:42.730]  kind of a,
[01:18:42.730 --> 01:18:46.050]  it's a bluish jacket with a purple shirt underneath it.
[01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:48.450]  And he had a purple hanky in one pocket.
[01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:50.090]  And at one point he pulled out a hanky
[01:18:50.090 --> 01:18:52.370]  out of his jacket pocket to do a joke.
[01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:56.170]  And the hanky out of his pocket was perfectly pressed
[01:18:56.170 --> 01:18:59.290]  and it was purple and it had gold pinstriping on it, dude.
[01:18:59.290 --> 01:19:01.970]  His pocket hanky was fucking stylish.
[01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:04.490]  Like this dude is stylish from head to toe.
[01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:06.210]  His shoes were sharp.
[01:19:06.210 --> 01:19:08.970]  The only thing that shocked me about the man was,
[01:19:08.970 --> 01:19:10.130]  so we saw the comp,
[01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:11.550]  we saw him record a show.
[01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:12.370]  While he's recording the show,
[01:19:12.370 --> 01:19:13.750]  I looked to the right and I see N'Gayo
[01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:15.670]  sitting backstage at Comedy Works.
[01:19:15.670 --> 01:19:16.510]  So I was like,
[01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:18.670]  we're going to hang out with N'Gayo and Greg, watch this.
[01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:20.110]  So after the show,
[01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:22.950]  we get bustled out.
[01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:24.950]  And after a couple of times of me looking over at Clint
[01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:26.230]  and he's looking like he's going to fall asleep.
[01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:27.470]  Also shout out to our friend, Joe.
[01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:28.750]  Our friend Joe met up with us.
[01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:29.590]  Yeah, what's up Joe?
[01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:30.410]  And joined us.
[01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:31.250]  We almost left Joe out.
[01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:32.070]  Sorry about that.
[01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.910]  Joe joined us for the comedy show.
[01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:33.750]  Joe had a great time.
[01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:35.090]  Joe is a huge Proops fan.
[01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:37.030]  So I looked over and Greg's kind of,
[01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:39.750]  or Clint's kind of fallen asleep a couple of times.
[01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:41.130]  And then after the show,
[01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:42.690]  we're looking for the guys and we can't find them.
[01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:43.530]  And a friend of mine is like,
[01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:45.090]  dude, they're down here in this area smoking.
[01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:46.450]  Just walk back there.
[01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:47.970]  And I walked back there and I could hear N'Gayo
[01:19:47.970 --> 01:19:48.810]  from a block away.
[01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:50.590]  He's got a very recognizable voice.
[01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:51.650]  So we walked down the stairs
[01:19:51.650 --> 01:19:52.970]  and they're just hanging out smoking.
[01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:56.010]  So N'Gayo greets me and knew my name.
[01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:58.530]  And then I introduced myself to Greg Proops.
[01:19:58.530 --> 01:19:59.370]  He sticks out his hand.
[01:19:59.370 --> 01:20:00.190]  We shake hands.
[01:20:00.190 --> 01:20:01.050]  I asked if we're interrupting.
[01:20:01.050 --> 01:20:02.730]  They said, no, I lit a joint.
[01:20:03.690 --> 01:20:05.770]  That's just what I felt like needed to happen.
[01:20:05.770 --> 01:20:08.330]  So then we started hanging out with these guys for,
[01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:09.490]  we hung out for an hour.
[01:20:10.150 --> 01:20:11.150]  One of the things I was going to say,
[01:20:11.150 --> 01:20:13.710]  what I led onto was the thing that shocked me about Greg,
[01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:15.490]  he smokes cigarettes.
[01:20:15.490 --> 01:20:18.110]  I never would have guessed Greg Proops smokes cigarettes.
[01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:18.950]  I don't know why.
[01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:20.510]  You would have thought that he was smarter than that.
[01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:21.350]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:22.510]  I think so, yes.
[01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:24.190]  Nothing against you cigarette smokers.
[01:20:24.190 --> 01:20:27.270]  I know, cause I've just recently finally got,
[01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:29.030]  I quit my e-cig too.
[01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.870]  Nice.
[01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:31.190]  I quit all that nicotine shit.
[01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:33.550]  I'm just doing weed now, which, you know,
[01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:36.070]  hit and miss that's a good thing or a bad thing.
[01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:37.270]  You know, that's better for you.
[01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:38.430]  Well, it's better for me,
[01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:39.890]  but it could also get me fired from my job.
[01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:40.730]  Oh yeah.
[01:20:40.730 --> 01:20:42.210]  Well, this guy's name is not Clint.
[01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:44.010]  This is Bobby McGee here.
[01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:46.970]  Welcome to the grow from your heart podcast.
[01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:47.810]  My name's Bob.
[01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:49.650]  I'm a G anyway.
[01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:52.250]  No, I understand cutting cigarettes out as hard.
[01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:53.090]  Yeah.
[01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:54.610]  And, but Greg Proops doing it.
[01:20:54.610 --> 01:20:56.690]  It just, it was like, wow, that's that,
[01:20:56.690 --> 01:20:57.650]  that was weird.
[01:20:57.650 --> 01:20:58.610]  And it stunk too.
[01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:59.430]  That's kind of,
[01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:02.250]  it was so weird that like I smell his cigarette worse than
[01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:04.450]  I could smell all the dankness around us.
[01:21:04.450 --> 01:21:05.410]  Shout out to NGIO.
[01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:09.150]  He pulled out some tangy from Cali that had some stink and
[01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:10.150]  some flavor to it.
[01:21:10.150 --> 01:21:11.390]  That tangy was delicious.
[01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:12.630]  I didn't get a chance to try.
[01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:13.470]  I smelt it.
[01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:15.870]  I was already too high by the time he had pulled that out.
[01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:16.710]  I smelt it though.
[01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:19.590]  I think my platinum OG trumped it.
[01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:20.430]  The platinum mode.
[01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:21.250]  He was,
[01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:23.030]  I gave him the last of my platinum OG that I had with me.
[01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:24.470]  And he looked quite impressed with it.
[01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:27.030]  He was, he was, and he was a nice guy too.
[01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:28.350]  So, and guy was a great dude.
[01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:29.170]  That is true.
[01:21:29.170 --> 01:21:31.390]  We smoked with these guys for like an hour and they were
[01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:34.230]  talking to us, not at us, not about us.
[01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:36.610]  Like we were just hanging out with normal people.
[01:21:36.610 --> 01:21:39.090]  At one point, Greg proofs was telling a baseball story.
[01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:39.930]  Go figure.
[01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:41.010]  If you know anything about proofs, you know,
[01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:42.730]  he's a huge baseball fan.
[01:21:42.730 --> 01:21:47.310]  And he was talking about a player leading off of first plate
[01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:49.250]  base in a celebration.
[01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:51.610]  And then the umpire yelled play ball.
[01:21:51.610 --> 01:21:54.130]  And the guy just stayed way off of first plate base.
[01:21:54.130 --> 01:21:56.670]  And so the first baseman reaches over with the ball and
[01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:58.010]  tags him out.
[01:21:58.010 --> 01:22:00.090]  And as he talks about tagging him out,
[01:22:00.090 --> 01:22:02.410]  he damn near punched me in the titty.
[01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:06.310]  Cause he tagged me out as like a physical act to show what
[01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:07.130]  happened.
[01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:07.970]  But he was being cool.
[01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:09.030]  No, he was just hanging out.
[01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:12.390]  And that story was the Kansas city Royal zone,
[01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:15.550]  George Brett for all the stoner fucking baseball.
[01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:17.830]  That was the story you were, that we were being told.
[01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:19.670]  5,000 hit light up on YouTube.
[01:22:19.670 --> 01:22:20.510]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:21.330]  That's exactly it.
[01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:22.550]  It's three years celebrating as 3000.
[01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:25.110]  But so when proofs was acting out the smack,
[01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:27.950]  he smacked me and looked at me like I was his buddy.
[01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:30.390]  And I tried not to light up like a school girl because I was
[01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:31.350]  stupid excited,
[01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:32.810]  but I thought it was pretty awesome.
[01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:33.930]  Greg proofs is one of my heroes.
[01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:37.990]  He's I'm a comedy nerd and he's a comedy legend and I'm a
[01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:40.410]  podcaster and he's got a great podcast.
[01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:41.850]  So something about,
[01:22:41.850 --> 01:22:46.770]  and he's articulate and he makes me speak and write better.
[01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:49.250]  He actually makes me more conscious of my,
[01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:52.290]  my vocabulary and my mouth when I'm trying and when I'm not
[01:22:52.290 --> 01:22:53.770]  super dabbed out.
[01:22:53.770 --> 01:22:55.610]  He's he was really funny.
[01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:57.730]  You know, there was some really funny parts to Doug too,
[01:22:57.730 --> 01:23:00.970]  though, you know, but you know, between the shows,
[01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:03.550]  I had a rough weekend because I was going to say, you know,
[01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:05.390]  but Graham Elliot, that was my favorite.
[01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:06.750]  Elwood Elwood, Graham Elwood.
[01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:07.590]  Graham Elwood.
[01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:08.430]  Yes. As I said,
[01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:09.270]  yes, just like you said,
[01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:10.270]  it wasn't recorded or anything.
[01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:11.390]  Wasn't nobody else.
[01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:12.870]  I hear that anyway.
[01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:16.710]  Graham Graham was my favorite of the little excursion.
[01:23:16.710 --> 01:23:18.630]  Clint is kind of owed a comedy show.
[01:23:18.630 --> 01:23:20.030]  You've got comedy blue balls right now.
[01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:24.710]  I'd assume it's fucking a little comedy tug.
[01:23:24.710 --> 01:23:25.550]  Yeah.
[01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:26.750]  May 10th. That'll be funny.
[01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:27.750]  May 10th. It'll be fun.
[01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:28.590]  May 10th.
[01:23:28.690 --> 01:23:31.610]  Maybe when Guy will come back, you know, that would be nice.
[01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:32.450]  That'd be cool.
[01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:33.290]  It'd be cool to see him.
[01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:35.170]  I'd love to know who was going to be on that,
[01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:37.370]  but I'm going to have my tat or my name tag ready.
[01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:38.210]  There you go.
[01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:39.690]  I don't know if I want to take my old,
[01:23:39.690 --> 01:23:40.970]  I've got a name tag made guys.
[01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:42.010]  If you don't know what we're talking about,
[01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:43.770]  when you go see Doug Benson, do Doug love movies,
[01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:44.610]  Doug loves movies.
[01:23:44.610 --> 01:23:45.570]  You got to take a name tag with you.
[01:23:45.570 --> 01:23:47.290]  I don't know if I want to take my old name tag or if I want
[01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:48.210]  to print up a new one.
[01:23:48.210 --> 01:23:49.770]  The old ones take your old one.
[01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:50.610]  There you go.
[01:23:50.610 --> 01:23:51.450]  Yeah.
[01:23:51.450 --> 01:23:52.270]  You'd be me.
[01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:54.670]  God, you're the laziest motherfucker.
[01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:57.010]  So we've got Doug loves movies on May 10th.
[01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.230]  Joey Diaz coming up after that.
[01:24:00.230 --> 01:24:01.070]  Yeah.
[01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.890]  And that's June.
[01:24:01.890 --> 01:24:02.730]  In June.
[01:24:02.730 --> 01:24:03.830]  And then what else do we have coming up?
[01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:04.870]  Brian Callen show.
[01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:05.710]  Brian Callen.
[01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:07.630]  I think it sounds like I'm going to see Brian Callen guys.
[01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:09.390]  I got to start listening to more Brian Callen.
[01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:10.230]  You don't have to.
[01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:11.750]  That's a, I can take somebody else.
[01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:13.710]  I'm all, well, you know, I'm all about seeing some Brian.
[01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:14.550]  Callen.
[01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:15.710]  That's why the fighter and the kid, right?
[01:24:15.710 --> 01:24:16.550]  Yeah, dude.
[01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:18.910]  No, it's, it's, it's going to be fun, dude.
[01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:20.710]  That's the thing is it's just fun going.
[01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:22.230]  You know, that's the thing is like,
[01:24:22.230 --> 01:24:23.510]  I'm not going to complain about this,
[01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:26.850]  like these couple of days, cause they were fun days.
[01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:30.230]  And it's funny that I can still be a little bit like,
[01:24:30.230 --> 01:24:31.070]  it wasn't that great,
[01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:34.070]  but we hung out with proops and Nungayo for a fucking hour.
[01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.910]  Yeah. For an hour.
[01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:36.190]  And just, that was great.
[01:24:36.190 --> 01:24:37.070]  Like bros. Yeah.
[01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:39.230]  Yeah. So I don't know what the hell I'm complaining about.
[01:24:39.230 --> 01:24:41.070]  And I could have probably smoked with Doug.
[01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:43.070]  I just didn't feel like hopping in that crowd.
[01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:44.110]  Yeah. That was a big crowd.
[01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:47.110]  But we're going to see Doug here in like two weeks.
[01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:49.670]  So everything's good, man.
[01:24:49.670 --> 01:24:50.550]  Mother's day guys.
[01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:52.790]  Have we mentioned that mother's day is good?
[01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:54.550]  How high are we?
[01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:55.670]  Remember that opener?
[01:24:55.930 --> 01:24:57.770]  Yeah. Cold open fucking from Clint.
[01:24:57.770 --> 01:24:58.970]  30 minutes ago.
[01:24:58.970 --> 01:25:00.770]  All right. We've been going for 30 minutes.
[01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:01.610]  That's pretty good.
[01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:03.370]  You got anything else you want to add about the,
[01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:05.050]  the comedy shows before we start wrapping it up
[01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:06.850]  and moving on to different subjects?
[01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:11.850]  Again, Comedy Works is one of the best clubs.
[01:25:11.850 --> 01:25:13.810]  If you haven't been there, please go check it out.
[01:25:13.810 --> 01:25:16.970]  It doesn't matter who you go see, it's going to be fun.
[01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:19.810]  It's, we have great service there all the time.
[01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:22.850]  They got waitresses running all over the place.
[01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:23.850]  And with us, you know,
[01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:26.510]  we're doing every Thursday down here in Pueblo.
[01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:28.310]  So if you want to see open mic comedy,
[01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:30.310]  we're still doing that every Thursday.
[01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:31.230]  At the rainbow.
[01:25:31.230 --> 01:25:32.070]  At the rainbow.
[01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.910]  At the rainbow.
[01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:33.730]  On Santa Fe.
[01:25:33.730 --> 01:25:35.190]  And guys, I know I keep talking about being VIP
[01:25:35.190 --> 01:25:37.150]  at Comedy Works and they treat me like a pimp.
[01:25:37.150 --> 01:25:38.950]  They will treat you like a pimp as well.
[01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:41.870]  They treat everybody like a rockstar there.
[01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:43.630]  I'm just six, five with dreadlocks
[01:25:43.630 --> 01:25:45.510]  and they recognize my high ass every time.
[01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:47.430]  So they remember me and I've made friends.
[01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:49.350]  Oh, and we're coming back kind of, you know.
[01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:50.190]  Frequently.
[01:25:50.190 --> 01:25:51.030]  Yeah. Fairly frequently.
[01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:52.590]  And I bring dank, dank weed
[01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:55.010]  and I might smoke out in the back every time.
[01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:55.850]  And they recognize me.
[01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:57.290]  That might happen.
[01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:58.490]  They might smell you coming
[01:25:58.490 --> 01:26:01.050]  before they see your fucking six, five,
[01:26:01.050 --> 01:26:01.890]  Ross to fucking ass.
[01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:04.410]  You know, it's fun when you take a date with you
[01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:06.770]  who's never really hung out with you out in public a lot.
[01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:08.250]  And you take her to a comedy show
[01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:09.610]  and everybody at the Comedy Works,
[01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:11.290]  125 miles from your house,
[01:26:11.290 --> 01:26:12.930]  high fives you and knows you by name.
[01:26:12.930 --> 01:26:13.770]  That's fucking funny.
[01:26:13.770 --> 01:26:15.290]  The comedians know you by name.
[01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:17.090]  Like that's a way to take a chick out.
[01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:18.810]  And she was like, what?
[01:26:18.810 --> 01:26:19.650]  That was pretty neat.
[01:26:19.650 --> 01:26:22.170]  Dude, I do want to go to the Canos Cup
[01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:23.570]  with you next year though.
[01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:24.910]  I don't know if you do because.
[01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:26.270]  Oh, I ain't smoking a whole bunch.
[01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:27.470]  No, I'm just saying every 10 feet,
[01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:30.310]  it's I get stopped and start a new conversation
[01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:31.790]  every 10 feet, every 10 feet.
[01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:32.630]  So yeah.
[01:26:32.630 --> 01:26:33.470]  Put a bag over your head.
[01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:34.290]  That's what you gotta do.
[01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:35.130]  I'll throw some dreadlocks on.
[01:26:35.130 --> 01:26:36.310]  They'll think that I am you.
[01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:37.150]  There we go.
[01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:37.970]  Because we're about the same height.
[01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:38.990]  We are close to the same height, dude.
[01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.910]  You could be my brother.
[01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:40.750]  That brother from another mother.
[01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:41.570]  This will work.
[01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:43.910]  And I'll just, I'll just kind of be like, yeah, man.
[01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:45.550]  Like, no, I'm just really high.
[01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:46.990]  And I just won't even open my eyes.
[01:26:46.990 --> 01:26:49.150]  You'll have sunglasses anyway, if you're being mean.
[01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:50.690]  See, here we go, man.
[01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:51.530]  We're on it.
[01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:52.350]  All right, guys.
[01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:53.250]  I just need an iRegion X shirt.
[01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:55.770]  I'm gonna send around a drone of me
[01:26:55.770 --> 01:26:57.010]  so that I can go kick it.
[01:26:58.370 --> 01:27:01.330]  He's still, he's still running around.
[01:27:01.330 --> 01:27:02.570]  Just somewhere else.
[01:27:03.730 --> 01:27:04.850]  We take breaks.
[01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:06.170]  We're on and off on shifts.
[01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:08.290]  Yeah, you need to be me for five hours.
[01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:09.130]  You get the morning shift.
[01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:10.690]  I'm good in the mornings.
[01:27:10.690 --> 01:27:11.530]  There you go.
[01:27:11.530 --> 01:27:12.970]  There's no people out there in the mornings.
[01:27:12.970 --> 01:27:13.890]  I'll take that shift.
[01:27:13.890 --> 01:27:15.410]  Plenty of people out there in the mornings.
[01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:17.450]  It was crazy this time in the mornings.
[01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:19.470]  Well, I guess you said that on the last podcast.
[01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:20.670]  You talked about it on the last one?
[01:27:20.670 --> 01:27:21.510]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:22.590]  Just how busy it is.
[01:27:22.590 --> 01:27:23.430]  How busy, yeah.
[01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:24.750]  How many people are running around.
[01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:25.910]  There were thousands of people there.
[01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:27.950]  I never looked for the official ticket sales
[01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:29.470]  to see how many people were there.
[01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:30.310]  Thousands.
[01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:31.270]  There were people that I know,
[01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:32.910]  I'm good on that one, but thanks.
[01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:34.590]  There were people that I did not get to see.
[01:27:34.590 --> 01:27:36.070]  He just tried to pass me a bowl of flowers
[01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:37.950]  and I turned it down because flowers really give me
[01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:40.270]  stupid bad cotton mouth on the show.
[01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:42.030]  I'll take a dab though.
[01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:43.950]  I'm gonna take a dab.
[01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:46.350]  So you said Thursday's at the Rainbow Bar.
[01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:48.890]  Thursday's at the Rainbow Bar, 9 p.m.
[01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:49.730]  Come check it out.
[01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:54.730]  You know, Wild Cousins just trying to keep going.
[01:27:54.930 --> 01:27:57.650]  You know, it's tough because we're not in the big city
[01:27:57.650 --> 01:28:00.650]  doing the big boy shows and stuff.
[01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:04.410]  Now, my boy John Bueno's starting to take off.
[01:28:04.410 --> 01:28:07.330]  He's really giving 100% to it.
[01:28:07.330 --> 01:28:08.170]  Good.
[01:28:08.170 --> 01:28:10.250]  I really think that he's gonna be one of the first guys
[01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:13.090]  out of Pueblo to really, because he's funny,
[01:28:13.090 --> 01:28:16.370]  he's a good guy, and he wants it.
[01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:19.870]  I saw his post about doing some show where he's hosting it.
[01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:21.270]  So I was proud of him for that.
[01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:24.070]  Yeah, I think he's going up to Longmont to host some,
[01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:25.390]  I don't remember who it was either.
[01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:26.790]  Is there a cover charge for your show
[01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:28.270]  on Thursdays at the Rainbow?
[01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:31.110]  The Rainbow is free every Thursday.
[01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:32.950]  Free, come see some free comedy, guys.
[01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:34.830]  It's open micers, but oh, we might get
[01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:35.950]  some weird shit here.
[01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:36.790]  We should be cool.
[01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:37.630]  Everything should have worked.
[01:28:37.630 --> 01:28:39.230]  I think everything's cool still happening.
[01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:40.790]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:42.830]  So those shows are gonna be free.
[01:28:43.570 --> 01:28:44.410]  Open micers.
[01:28:44.410 --> 01:28:45.230]  Yeah.
[01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:46.070]  They didn't miss shit, hopefully.
[01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:47.410]  We're gonna have to go back and look,
[01:28:47.410 --> 01:28:48.810]  because that's got me sketched out.
[01:28:48.810 --> 01:28:50.730]  So yeah, I hope all that recorded, guys.
[01:28:50.730 --> 01:28:55.730]  Welcome to part two, because we just recorded part one.
[01:28:56.690 --> 01:28:57.530]  It's missing.
[01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:58.670]  It looks like everything worked,
[01:28:58.670 --> 01:29:00.970]  but I can tell that GarageBand was pissed off at me
[01:29:00.970 --> 01:29:01.810]  for a second there.
[01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:02.650]  There was an update on the computer,
[01:29:02.650 --> 01:29:04.110]  and everything's still kind of wonky.
[01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:05.930]  But so yeah, I'm about to take this dab,
[01:29:05.930 --> 01:29:07.890]  is what I was gonna do.
[01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:10.050]  The free shows, you'll see some open micers there.
[01:29:10.050 --> 01:29:12.770]  What type of, who will we see at these open mic events
[01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:14.450]  on a Thursday?
[01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:15.270]  Who do you think will show up?
[01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:17.030]  You know, we got a lot of guys.
[01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:19.750]  Myself, I'm gonna get back after it.
[01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:20.950]  I took a little bit of a break,
[01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:22.830]  but I gotta get back after it.
[01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:25.030]  And then my boy, Paul Rosales,
[01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:27.830]  he's there every Thursday.
[01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:28.670]  Really funny guy.
[01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:32.030]  If you guys listened to the episode 62, Wild Cousins,
[01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:33.510]  he was the funny one.
[01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:34.550]  Yeah, he was the funny one
[01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:36.110]  that's looking for a dude to hook up with.
[01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:37.310]  Dude, I fucking.
[01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:38.190]  That shit was funny.
[01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:39.350]  Oh, we had a good time.
[01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:40.850]  He's really funny.
[01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:45.230]  John Buenos, like I said, really, really funny.
[01:29:45.230 --> 01:29:47.670]  We got other guys coming through.
[01:29:47.670 --> 01:29:49.030]  Sometimes it's brand new guys.
[01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:51.310]  If you're a brand new guy and you want to try comedy,
[01:29:51.310 --> 01:29:52.910]  there's no better place than the Rainbow.
[01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:53.730]  Or a brand new gal.
[01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:54.870]  Or yeah, please, I'm sorry.
[01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:58.310]  I meant, when I say dude, I mean guy and gal.
[01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:59.150]  Yeah, it's all unisex.
[01:29:59.150 --> 01:30:02.470]  And when I say guy, I just mean anybody.
[01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:05.350]  I really don't mean it as like only guys can do whatever.
[01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:06.190]  Right, no, no, no.
[01:30:06.190 --> 01:30:07.010]  That'd be weird.
[01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:07.850]  I wish more ladies had come out.
[01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:09.190]  They don't want to do it.
[01:30:09.190 --> 01:30:10.750]  Anyway, maybe I'm intimidating.
[01:30:11.610 --> 01:30:13.850]  I'm six foot five, four foot dreadlocks.
[01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:16.370]  You should see Clint's dreads.
[01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:17.970]  They're intimidating, not really.
[01:30:17.970 --> 01:30:19.210]  They don't get no dread dread.
[01:30:19.210 --> 01:30:20.550]  Anyway.
[01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:21.530]  Do you have any other shows coming up?
[01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:22.530]  Any specific dates?
[01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:24.010]  No, not right now.
[01:30:24.010 --> 01:30:26.290]  Just Mother's Day, that's it.
[01:30:26.290 --> 01:30:27.210]  Mother's Day, yes.
[01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:28.530]  He's taking your mom out.
[01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:29.650]  No, I don't mean that.
[01:30:29.650 --> 01:30:31.570]  You take your mom out.
[01:30:31.570 --> 01:30:32.610]  Take your own mothers out.
[01:30:32.610 --> 01:30:34.010]  Take them to dinner.
[01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:35.170]  Do it on the ninth, I don't know.
[01:30:35.170 --> 01:30:37.090]  Make sure you guys follow Clint on Instagram and Twitter.
[01:30:37.090 --> 01:30:37.930]  It's at tallclint.
[01:30:37.930 --> 01:30:39.090]  At tallclint.
[01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:40.530]  He hasn't been posting a lot lately,
[01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:42.110]  but he's getting back into it.
[01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:43.390]  He took kind of a hiatus to get his shit together.
[01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:44.350]  We respect that.
[01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:45.190]  Fuck yeah.
[01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:47.830]  But the social media takes a lot of your damn time,
[01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:48.670]  I've noticed.
[01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:51.670]  I post a lot and then I catch myself like,
[01:30:51.670 --> 01:30:53.750]  oh, I've been on here for 30 minutes.
[01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:55.470]  I gotta wipe and get out of here.
[01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:57.550]  I didn't see that coming.
[01:30:59.630 --> 01:31:00.470]  Either did I.
[01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:01.310]  Either did I.
[01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:02.150]  It came back to me.
[01:31:02.150 --> 01:31:03.110]  Oh, you proopsed it.
[01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:05.190]  All right, we are going to wrap up this show, you guys.
[01:31:05.190 --> 01:31:07.310]  Dude, thank you for coming to the podcast.
[01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:09.550]  Thanks for hanging out with me at Comedy Shows.
[01:31:09.570 --> 01:31:10.770]  Thanks for all the shows we have
[01:31:10.770 --> 01:31:11.890]  playing together in the future.
[01:31:11.890 --> 01:31:12.730]  We've been having fun.
[01:31:12.730 --> 01:31:13.730]  Dude, we have a lot of fun.
[01:31:13.730 --> 01:31:14.970]  Thanks to the audience.
[01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:16.090]  Yeah, team tall guy.
[01:31:16.090 --> 01:31:16.930]  Thanks to the audience.
[01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:18.290]  Yeah, that's, I think so.
[01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:19.130]  Yeah, tweet at us.
[01:31:19.130 --> 01:31:19.950]  Let us know what you think.
[01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:21.050]  This one was a little rambly.
[01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:21.890]  I apologize.
[01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:22.810]  It was a lot of rambly,
[01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:25.490]  but sometimes you gotta cut loose and have a comedy show
[01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:27.250]  instead of all about uptight weed.
[01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:29.610]  I'm pretty sure you guys are getting a lot of weed anyway.
[01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:31.450]  And if you made it this far, good job.
[01:31:31.450 --> 01:31:32.450]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:34.730]  Make sure you clean the filters in your air conditioners
[01:31:34.730 --> 01:31:37.210]  and calibrate your pH meters.
[01:31:37.210 --> 01:31:38.030]  There you go.
[01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:39.130]  That was some weed advice for the show.
[01:31:39.710 --> 01:31:40.550]  You did it.
[01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:41.370]  Yeah, we got some in there.
[01:31:41.370 --> 01:31:42.210]  Oh man.
[01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:47.070]  Also make sure that they don't have centipedes
[01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:48.790]  because those are scary.
[01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:49.630]  There you go.
[01:31:49.630 --> 01:31:50.450]  You heard it from Clint.
[01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:51.510]  Centipedes are scary.
[01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:52.590]  All right guys, thanks for listening.
[01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:54.470]  I'm gonna be back in a few days with another episode.
[01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:55.470]  I'm not sure if it'll be,
[01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:57.370]  I'm not sure if this came out on a Wednesday or Monday,
[01:31:57.370 --> 01:31:59.470]  so I'm not sure how this is gonna go.
[01:31:59.470 --> 01:32:00.950]  We'll see how it works.

[01:32:15.090 --> 01:32:16.490]  go outside and smoke a fat joint,
[01:32:16.490 --> 01:32:17.450]  and then it'll be funny.
[01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:18.370]  It'll be great.

[01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:27.810]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:33:27.810 --> 01:33:29.610]  It's time for episode number 68
[01:33:29.610 --> 01:33:31.530]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[01:33:31.530 --> 01:33:35.410]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:37.410]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[01:33:37.410 --> 01:33:39.210]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[01:33:39.210 --> 01:33:40.450]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:41.570]  or even someone who's just curious
[01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:43.250]  about the current state of cannabis,
[01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:45.050]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:45.930]  I'm your host, Rostan Jeff.
[01:33:45.930 --> 01:33:47.510]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:49.390]  As always, I wanna send a big thank you shout out
[01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:50.290]  to the Mystic Roots band
[01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:51.730]  for letting me use their music on the show.
[01:33:51.730 --> 01:33:56.130]  Big thanks to Kat Coop and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:57.050]  What's up, everybody?
[01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:58.370]  I'm not gonna do any ads this episode
[01:33:58.370 --> 01:34:00.530]  because I have a lot of stuff written down.
[01:34:01.730 --> 01:34:03.730]  I'm gonna drop that music out a little bit.
[01:34:03.730 --> 01:34:04.570]  I've been telling you guys
[01:34:04.570 --> 01:34:06.890]  that I'm gonna do a lesson on grow room scheduling.
[01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:08.410]  Well, I've started working on that
[01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:10.810]  and I have got a lot of information.
[01:34:10.810 --> 01:34:11.970]  Before I get to that part,
[01:34:11.970 --> 01:34:13.690]  I wanna talk about a couple of things.
[01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:16.610]  I went and got my medical marijuana card renewed
[01:34:16.630 --> 01:34:18.110]  a couple of days ago.
[01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:19.510]  I was thinking I should talk about that on the show.
[01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:21.070]  I'm gonna turn down the music real quiet here
[01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:22.510]  and just start the show right now.
[01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:24.470]  No ads this time, you guys, no ads.
[01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:26.150]  Quick shout out to Hygro and their growing supplies
[01:34:26.150 --> 01:34:28.270]  and super huge shout out to Rocky Mountain Worm Company
[01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:29.710]  and Nature's Green Remedies.
[01:34:29.710 --> 01:34:31.310]  That's my ads for today.
[01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:32.770]  I got a lot to talk about.
[01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:34.810]  I got my medical marijuana card renewed.
[01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:37.870]  Dude, the process has gotten super simple.
[01:34:39.190 --> 01:34:40.670]  I pretty much called, made an appointment.
[01:34:40.670 --> 01:34:41.830]  I showed up.
[01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:43.990]  They got me in at my scheduled appointment time.
[01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:45.270]  That's the first time that's ever happened
[01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:47.570]  to a medical marijuana doctor.
[01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:48.410]  They got me in there.
[01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:49.330]  They got me seen.
[01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:52.810]  They got my, it's not a license, you guys.
[01:34:52.810 --> 01:34:54.370]  It bugs me for some reason
[01:34:54.370 --> 01:34:56.350]  because nobody here has a marijuana license.
[01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:59.570]  It's a medical marijuana recommendation from a doctor.
[01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:00.410]  It's not a prescription.
[01:35:00.410 --> 01:35:01.370]  It's not a license.
[01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:03.330]  So he writes out a recommendation for you.
[01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:06.370]  And then, I was debating it
[01:35:06.370 --> 01:35:07.890]  if I wanted to talk about this or not.
[01:35:07.890 --> 01:35:09.510]  On the table in the doctor's office,
[01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:11.970]  there's just a little sign and it says,
[01:35:11.970 --> 01:35:14.290]  increased plant count will require records.
[01:35:14.290 --> 01:35:16.030]  And then, there's a dollar sign
[01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:17.350]  and then an amount of plants.
[01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:19.470]  And then, another dollar sign and an amount of plants.
[01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:22.730]  And if you provide records and you tell this doctor
[01:35:22.730 --> 01:35:25.430]  that you are in need of a higher plant count,
[01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:28.390]  he will increase your plant count for a small fee.
[01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:29.870]  So if you're not a Colorado resident
[01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:31.590]  and if you're not familiar with all that,
[01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:33.310]  what that means is when you go to this doctor,
[01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:34.830]  when you get your medical marijuana card,
[01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:38.430]  you are now allowed to grow six plants
[01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:39.990]  in your private residence.
[01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:43.630]  These doctors are now able to write in recommendations
[01:35:43.650 --> 01:35:46.010]  that you are able to grow more cannabis
[01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:49.370]  and possess more cannabis than the original six.
[01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:50.190]  But to do that,
[01:35:50.190 --> 01:35:52.330]  you've got to bring a little bit of doctor note,
[01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:54.010]  some sort of history, some sort of records
[01:35:54.010 --> 01:35:55.670]  saying that something's wrong with you.
[01:35:55.670 --> 01:35:57.970]  And you also have to pay a fee.
[01:35:57.970 --> 01:35:59.490]  So for a small fee,
[01:35:59.490 --> 01:36:01.210]  I walked out of there with a handsome plant count.
[01:36:01.210 --> 01:36:02.490]  I won't talk about the numbers on the show.
[01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:03.690]  I don't really have a huge plant count.
[01:36:03.690 --> 01:36:04.530]  I don't need that many.
[01:36:04.530 --> 01:36:05.930]  I just want it to be safe.
[01:36:05.930 --> 01:36:07.270]  So, and I went for what he would give me
[01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:08.490]  just to see if he would do it.
[01:36:08.490 --> 01:36:10.890]  And I got the highest he offered there.
[01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:12.490]  So that was super easy.
[01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:16.270]  I want to talk about the benefits of doing that.
[01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:18.310]  The reason I did it is because of course I grow
[01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:19.790]  and I want to keep my grow protected
[01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:22.230]  with my medical marijuana card.
[01:36:22.230 --> 01:36:23.070]  That allows me,
[01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:24.750]  it gives me a little bit more safety I feel like.
[01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:28.710]  And also the recreational shops are really high priced.
[01:36:28.710 --> 01:36:32.030]  If you were to buy a gram of hash at a recreational shop,
[01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:34.030]  it would cost you probably twice as much
[01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:35.610]  as it would at a medical shop.
[01:36:35.610 --> 01:36:40.510]  So I keep my medical marijuana privileges intact
[01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:41.510]  a lot for that.
[01:36:41.530 --> 01:36:43.690]  Because sometimes I do run out of shatter
[01:36:43.690 --> 01:36:44.530]  and I have to go,
[01:36:44.530 --> 01:36:46.570]  I go up to Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado Springs
[01:36:46.570 --> 01:36:50.230]  and I purchase grams of hash from our friend's hunt
[01:36:50.230 --> 01:36:52.290]  and the Jordan's and the John's
[01:36:52.290 --> 01:36:54.490]  up at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[01:36:54.490 --> 01:36:56.730]  So that's a good reason to keep my
[01:36:56.730 --> 01:36:59.850]  medical marijuana card intact.
[01:36:59.850 --> 01:37:01.050]  So I talked about the benefits.
[01:37:01.050 --> 01:37:03.290]  I talked about the process and I talked about the cost.
[01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:05.210]  I feel like it covered the medical marijuana card experience.
[01:37:05.210 --> 01:37:07.010]  It was super easy this time.
[01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:08.450]  I'm not going to say the doctor's name
[01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:09.410]  or anything on the podcast,
[01:37:09.410 --> 01:37:10.450]  but if you'd like his information,
[01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:12.470]  just email me, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:13.390]  and I'll get you that doctor.
[01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:14.990]  He is in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:17.030]  So if you're looking for a doctor in Pueblo,
[01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:18.790]  I've got a recommendation for you.
[01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:20.070]  Let's move on to my next topic.
[01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:21.390]  I really want to get to the grow lesson,
[01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:24.670]  but I've got a few things written down that I want to cover.
[01:37:24.670 --> 01:37:26.310]  This is just kind of a personal thing.
[01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:29.230]  I keep seeing a lot of people talking about
[01:37:29.230 --> 01:37:31.210]  the temperature of their e-nail.
[01:37:32.150 --> 01:37:35.070]  The e-nail is the little box that plugs into the wall.
[01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:39.870]  That's got an LED or an LCD display on there.
[01:37:40.210 --> 01:37:41.050]  It's usually an LED, right?
[01:37:41.050 --> 01:37:43.450]  Little LED light display, shows numbers.
[01:37:43.450 --> 01:37:44.930]  And then it's got an up and down switch on it.
[01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:46.690]  You can make the temperature hotter and cooler.
[01:37:46.690 --> 01:37:48.850]  And then the one I have actually has a USB port in it
[01:37:48.850 --> 01:37:49.870]  so that you can charge your iPhone
[01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:51.410]  or whatever kind of phone you got on there.
[01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:52.650]  But then it's got a little cord that comes out
[01:37:52.650 --> 01:37:54.210]  and it attaches to the nail
[01:37:54.210 --> 01:37:55.650]  and it heats up the nail for you all the time.
[01:37:55.650 --> 01:37:56.490]  So that's the e-nail.
[01:37:56.490 --> 01:37:58.210]  And then your dad nail is always hot, right?
[01:37:59.810 --> 01:38:02.370]  The temperature on your nail
[01:38:03.730 --> 01:38:06.850]  does not match what the numbers on that box say.
[01:38:06.850 --> 01:38:08.090]  That's what I'm trying to get to here.
[01:38:08.110 --> 01:38:09.910]  That's gonna be my point.
[01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:12.070]  A lot of people say they've seen pictures of my e-nail
[01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:14.910]  and right now it's flashing at 852.
[01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:17.410]  It's jumping between 850 and 852.
[01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:20.310]  And honestly, if you tried to take a dab with that
[01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:22.630]  at 852 degrees, I feel like that'd be too hot.
[01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:24.850]  But that is not a representation of degrees.
[01:38:24.850 --> 01:38:27.630]  That is simply a setting on the box.
[01:38:27.630 --> 01:38:30.910]  I don't think that, and maybe there is one brand,
[01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:32.310]  maybe one or two brands that does this,
[01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:35.470]  but I don't think that that coil
[01:38:35.470 --> 01:38:38.430]  is sending the temperature to that nail
[01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:39.390]  and all the way back to there
[01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:41.550]  and telling it that it's 860 degrees.
[01:38:41.550 --> 01:38:45.350]  That is more of a setting like a,
[01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:47.750]  like if you turn your volume on your car stereo to 11,
[01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:49.510]  you're not putting out 11 anythings.
[01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:50.590]  You're just on 11.
[01:38:50.590 --> 01:38:52.990]  You know that 11 is, like I know that my car stereo,
[01:38:52.990 --> 01:38:54.270]  I can crank it up to about 28
[01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:57.110]  before the subwoofer starts sounding like complete crap.
[01:38:57.110 --> 01:39:00.590]  So I know that 26 is my ideal temp on my car stereo.
[01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:03.230]  It doesn't mean I'm putting out 26 anything in particulars.
[01:39:03.230 --> 01:39:04.830]  It's just the level where it is.
[01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:07.230]  And that's what I think your emails are doing.
[01:39:07.230 --> 01:39:11.190]  We have established that the 860 I'm seeing on my screen
[01:39:11.190 --> 01:39:13.930]  right now on my LED is actually a frequency
[01:39:13.930 --> 01:39:15.590]  that is being put out.
[01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:19.090]  And that's what's being measured by that number.
[01:39:19.090 --> 01:39:21.750]  So you got to keep in mind that that number
[01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:23.470]  has to travel all the way down the cord
[01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:24.870]  and then it has to get to the coil.
[01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:27.010]  And that coil is the heating part.
[01:39:27.010 --> 01:39:29.550]  That coil has to heat whatever type of nail you're using.
[01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:31.910]  I'm using this new highly educated,
[01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:33.470]  it's the E-Nail Insert.
[01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:34.310]  Which one is it?
[01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:36.150]  Let me read it.
[01:39:36.150 --> 01:39:38.270]  I knew the name until I started talking.
[01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:42.830]  It is the HED adapter.
[01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:43.790]  So I'm using that one.
[01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:45.910]  So you've got to heat up this barrel shaped piece
[01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:47.870]  and then the head of the nail heats up after that
[01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:49.430]  because the heat's got to travel.
[01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:52.750]  So for it to know what the exact heat is
[01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:55.990]  on the head of that nail would be kind of ridiculous
[01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:57.130]  to ask of that device.
[01:39:57.130 --> 01:39:59.670]  So my point is that number doesn't match
[01:39:59.670 --> 01:40:00.750]  that head of the nail.
[01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:04.270]  You guys, that is a frequency or a dial setting.
[01:40:05.110 --> 01:40:06.670]  So when you find the ideal number,
[01:40:06.670 --> 01:40:08.030]  just remember that ideal number
[01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:09.630]  and that's kind of where you want to be.
[01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:12.290]  You're not actually getting at 856 degrees
[01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:14.790]  or I've seen some of them set at perfectly 710
[01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:16.870]  because people think that's the perfect temp.
[01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:18.910]  That number is not correlating to the nail, you guys.
[01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:21.390]  So when you see my pictures and it's at 850,
[01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:22.230]  quit bitching at me.
[01:40:22.230 --> 01:40:24.230]  I think that's my point here.
[01:40:24.230 --> 01:40:26.830]  All right, I have another topic written down.
[01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:28.670]  But the iPhone has locked me out.
[01:40:28.670 --> 01:40:29.590]  Here we go.
[01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:31.710]  The next one, oh, the pesticide issue.
[01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:34.350]  Man, we talked about this a little bit
[01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:36.430]  in a previous episode.
[01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:39.450]  I talked about some of the dispensaries that got in trouble
[01:40:39.450 --> 01:40:41.390]  and I saw a quick article.
[01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:42.230]  Scroll through my phone here.
[01:40:42.230 --> 01:40:44.590]  I should have been a little more prepared.
[01:40:44.590 --> 01:40:47.670]  People are kind of upset about this pesticide issue.
[01:40:47.670 --> 01:40:49.530]  And here is what I saw.
[01:40:49.530 --> 01:40:54.030]  This was all over social media websites today.
[01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:56.670]  It says, pesticide violations were issued
[01:40:56.670 --> 01:40:59.750]  to the following recreational marijuana grow facilities.
[01:40:59.750 --> 01:41:02.070]  And then it lists, Mindful, Green Solutions,
[01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:04.710]  Evolutionary Holdings, Green Cross Colorado,
[01:41:04.710 --> 01:41:07.350]  MMJ America, Organic Greens,
[01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:10.710]  Altitude East Treatments, RINO, and Sweet Leaf.
[01:41:10.710 --> 01:41:13.410]  All violators were using EGLE 20
[01:41:13.410 --> 01:41:15.070]  and petroleum-based fungicide
[01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:17.530]  that is harmful to humans and animals.
[01:41:17.530 --> 01:41:20.430]  Altitude East Treatments was also using Mallet and Avid,
[01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:22.790]  both harmful to humans and animals.
[01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:25.030]  Green Cross Denver was also using Mallet.
[01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:27.010]  Many of these violations are well-known.
[01:41:27.010 --> 01:41:29.630]  And then it goes on to talk about a lot more stuff.
[01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:31.350]  I don't know the original source of that
[01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:32.470]  because I've seen it cut and pasted
[01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:34.470]  on so many different social media sites
[01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:36.430]  that I don't know who to give credit to that.
[01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:41.350]  But these guys were spraying EGLE 20 on plants
[01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:43.870]  and then selling those buds to people.
[01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:45.830]  And the weird part here is MMJ America
[01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:47.510]  just won a cannabis cup.
[01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:48.710]  So what's going on with that?
[01:41:48.710 --> 01:41:51.590]  These guys are, did they enter their EGLE 20-laden buds
[01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:52.550]  into the cannabis cup?
[01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:55.590]  Or are they growing separate cups or separate crops
[01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:57.430]  and entering that and not even giving the public
[01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:58.590]  a chance to go buy that?
[01:41:58.630 --> 01:42:02.150]  Because I suspect that that's what some of the shops do.
[01:42:02.150 --> 01:42:04.470]  So these plants have been taken off the market.
[01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:06.930]  Those plants will never make it to harvest.
[01:42:06.930 --> 01:42:09.830]  And those buds will never be sold to customers or patients.
[01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:13.590]  But I'm sure that there was medicine or product
[01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:15.590]  that did make it out of the door
[01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:17.390]  and has been treated with EGLE 20
[01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:19.030]  or whatever else they were listing here
[01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:21.590]  that we definitely should not be consuming.
[01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:24.270]  If this were to happen to, if these were tomatoes
[01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:25.470]  and they discovered that these people
[01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:27.750]  had been spraying tomatoes with these products,
[01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:30.590]  the tomato farmer or distributor
[01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:31.990]  or whoever's in charge at that point
[01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:34.830]  would have to go make some sort of a press release
[01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:35.670]  and apologize.
[01:42:35.670 --> 01:42:37.310]  They'd have to be held accountable.
[01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:38.590]  This would have been a much larger deal
[01:42:38.590 --> 01:42:41.350]  if this would have been another agricultural product
[01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:42.990]  or a horticultural product.
[01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:45.390]  And what's ridiculous is the cannabis industry
[01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:48.030]  makes so much money that they should have been
[01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:50.430]  kind of on top of this
[01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:52.790]  and been doing the right thing anyway.
[01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:54.230]  Like we're getting illegal cannabis here
[01:42:54.230 --> 01:42:55.950]  and then we're trying to set the pace here
[01:42:55.950 --> 01:42:58.230]  and then they're gonna go and do shit like this
[01:42:58.230 --> 01:42:59.510]  which really puts, I don't know,
[01:42:59.510 --> 01:43:02.430]  kind of a black eye on the legal cannabis industry.
[01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:03.270]  I don't know.
[01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:04.910]  I think that the people that were leading the industry
[01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:07.710]  should have been more responsible with our industry.
[01:43:07.710 --> 01:43:10.950]  All right, so I can't say to not shop at those stores
[01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:11.790]  or anything like that.
[01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:12.630]  Do what you wanna do,
[01:43:12.630 --> 01:43:13.750]  but I would definitely pay more attention
[01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:15.510]  to where my medicine is coming from
[01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:16.510]  and I would pay more attention
[01:43:16.510 --> 01:43:18.630]  to what's going in my medicine.
[01:43:18.630 --> 01:43:20.870]  All the more reason you guys to grow your own cannabis.
[01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:21.910]  That's my solution.
[01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:22.990]  That's what I think.
[01:43:22.990 --> 01:43:24.070]  All right, I've got a couple of more notes.
[01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:26.270]  What else did I wanna get on to?
[01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:28.750]  Actually, we're gonna, let's just get right to it.
[01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:31.190]  I wanna talk about grow room scheduling, you guys.
[01:43:31.190 --> 01:43:32.710]  We're 10 minutes into the show already
[01:43:32.710 --> 01:43:35.070]  and I have got a lot of notes here.
[01:43:35.070 --> 01:43:38.710]  So this is probably gonna end up taking us
[01:43:38.710 --> 01:43:40.930]  a couple of episodes here, honestly.
[01:43:40.930 --> 01:43:44.110]  So we're gonna get through the veg process today
[01:43:44.110 --> 01:43:45.830]  and then the next lesson
[01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:49.410]  will be planning your flowering cycles.
[01:43:49.410 --> 01:43:50.510]  So I wrote a whole bunch of stuff
[01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:53.710]  and honestly, it took me a little bit to get this together
[01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:56.510]  and I'm gonna apologize right now.
[01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:58.990]  I know that the last few episodes have been a little wonky.
[01:43:58.990 --> 01:44:00.630]  I seriously had a major concussion
[01:44:00.630 --> 01:44:04.550]  and I can't focus to write long things like I used to,
[01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:05.650]  long lessons and shit.
[01:44:05.650 --> 01:44:07.630]  It's coming back to me slowly,
[01:44:07.630 --> 01:44:09.030]  but it takes me a little more effort
[01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:12.150]  and a lot more time to focus and write down shit.
[01:44:12.150 --> 01:44:14.750]  So please bear with me, but the lessons are coming back.
[01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:15.590]  Things are getting better.
[01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:17.350]  I know that things have not been the way
[01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:18.430]  they should be with the show,
[01:44:18.430 --> 01:44:19.830]  but I have not been the way I should be.
[01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:21.390]  So I couldn't bring you the show you needed.
[01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:22.750]  I'm getting my shit back together,
[01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:25.190]  which means the show is getting its shit back together too.
[01:44:25.190 --> 01:44:27.630]  I apologize for being kind of slacking off,
[01:44:27.630 --> 01:44:30.150]  but I didn't even know.
[01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:31.670]  When you get a head injury,
[01:44:31.670 --> 01:44:32.870]  you don't know what the hell's going on
[01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:33.910]  and it's crazy weird.
[01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:35.790]  So I'm getting back to it
[01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:36.890]  and the show's getting back to it.
[01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:37.950]  So let me prove that to you.
[01:44:37.950 --> 01:44:41.590]  Here's what I've written and I have got a lot here.
[01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:43.370]  I think I'm gonna try to read it off the computer
[01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:44.750]  because the phone screen is tiny.
[01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:47.310]  Let's pull up the same thing here on the phone.
[01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:48.310]  Same thing on the computer.
[01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:49.150]  Does it match?
[01:44:49.150 --> 01:44:50.510]  No, this one's not updated.
[01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:52.870]  All right, we're just gonna read it off the phone.
[01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:54.710]  It goes like this.
[01:44:54.710 --> 01:44:58.850]  So an average grow should take about 100 to 120 days,
[01:44:58.850 --> 01:45:00.710]  maybe 150 days total in the soil
[01:45:00.710 --> 01:45:03.790]  before harvesting, drying, trimming and curing.
[01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:07.310]  Our goal is to provide our plants with optimal conditions,
[01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:09.070]  appropriate feedings, careful training
[01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:11.070]  and selective pruning in order to produce
[01:45:11.070 --> 01:45:14.750]  the finest medicine we can offer to our patients or clients.
[01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:16.870]  I think that every day in each cycle
[01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:18.750]  is an opportunity to show the plant some love
[01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:20.870]  and help your crop reach its full potential.
[01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:23.350]  I feel like each feeding, each application of teas,
[01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:25.910]  bug sprays, foliar feeding and any interaction
[01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:27.910]  with your plants is your chance to make sure
[01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:30.050]  your crop reaches your client's expectations
[01:45:30.050 --> 01:45:32.150]  and the plant's full potential.
[01:45:32.150 --> 01:45:33.530]  A great way to improve your crops
[01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:35.630]  is to start a solid grow schedule.
[01:45:35.630 --> 01:45:37.590]  Today I wanna talk about two different schedules
[01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:39.010]  a grower should be on top of.
[01:45:39.010 --> 01:45:41.990]  The first schedule will be the basic planting of a crop
[01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:44.470]  from seed to clone all the way up to harvest time.
[01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:46.590]  I want to discuss the phases of growth
[01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:49.150]  from a small clone or seedling into vegetative growth
[01:45:49.150 --> 01:45:50.630]  into the flowering phase.
[01:45:50.630 --> 01:45:52.990]  I wanna break down the flowering phase into trimesters
[01:45:52.990 --> 01:45:54.470]  and talk about what the plants are doing
[01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:56.950]  and what they want through the flowering phase.
[01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:59.070]  I'll also talk about what you could be doing
[01:45:59.070 --> 01:46:01.210]  at each phase to improve your harvest.
[01:46:02.570 --> 01:46:03.950]  I wrote here that if I can get you through
[01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:06.350]  120 day grow lesson in this episode,
[01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:08.990]  I'll start my discussion on planning a schedule
[01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:11.150]  that keeps your grow space producing as much herb
[01:46:11.150 --> 01:46:14.110]  as possible with as little downtime as possible.
[01:46:14.110 --> 01:46:15.750]  This of course will take multiple lights
[01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:17.790]  and at least two small grow spaces,
[01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:19.570]  but setting up a small perpetual grow
[01:46:19.570 --> 01:46:21.670]  to keep yourself supplied with head stash
[01:46:21.670 --> 01:46:23.870]  is probably easier than you think.
[01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:25.590]  I realized now that I've written way too much
[01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:27.270]  for one episode, so this is definitely
[01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:29.010]  gonna be broken down you guys.
[01:46:29.010 --> 01:46:30.530]  So here's where we get into it.
[01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:31.590]  Before you begin your grow,
[01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:33.170]  I suggest getting yourself a planner
[01:46:33.170 --> 01:46:34.910]  and making a schedule in advance.
[01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:37.050]  You can be flexible because these are plants,
[01:46:37.050 --> 01:46:38.910]  but try to stick with your plan if you can.
[01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:42.190]  I also suggest taking a lot of notes you guys.
[01:46:42.190 --> 01:46:43.230]  Take a lot of notes.
[01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:45.630]  Don't wonder what you did to that plant
[01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:47.310]  to make it so special.
[01:46:47.310 --> 01:46:49.910]  Write down what you did so that you know.
[01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:53.150]  All right, so here's where I'll describe
[01:46:53.150 --> 01:46:56.230]  the phases of growth and timeframes of our plant.
[01:46:56.230 --> 01:46:59.310]  I said that this grow is gonna take about 100 to 120 days.
[01:46:59.310 --> 01:47:02.670]  If you wanna go larger plants, you can go up to 150.
[01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:04.270]  I've seen people take a lot longer.
[01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:05.910]  That's the veg period is what's gonna make
[01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:06.730]  your difference there.
[01:47:06.730 --> 01:47:09.390]  So we'll start off with seedlings or clones, right?
[01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:11.130]  And that's gonna take about 14 days
[01:47:11.130 --> 01:47:13.390]  to be in the seedling phase.
[01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:15.510]  I think about 14 days when you start germinating it
[01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:18.030]  from the day you germinate it to the day
[01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:18.870]  it's like a little plant.
[01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:19.790]  It's about 14 days.
[01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:21.590]  We're gonna call that 14 days.
[01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:23.590]  A clone takes about 14 days to root
[01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:24.750]  and get ready to be a plant.
[01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:28.310]  So I'm gonna say seedling and clone phase is about 14 days.
[01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:30.670]  The veg growth depends on your goal, you guys.
[01:47:30.670 --> 01:47:33.350]  If you wanna veg, if you're going in small pots,
[01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:34.590]  you can veg for two weeks.
[01:47:34.590 --> 01:47:37.030]  If you're gonna go into larger pots, you can veg.
[01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:39.250]  I've seen people veg for 30, 45 days.
[01:47:39.250 --> 01:47:41.510]  I've also seen guys veg for 60 days.
[01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:43.750]  Some of the outdoor plants that people veg
[01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:47.550]  for the early start of the year before the outdoor season,
[01:47:47.550 --> 01:47:50.110]  I've seen people veg plants for four or five or six months
[01:47:50.110 --> 01:47:51.510]  to put them outside.
[01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:53.710]  So what's gonna happen is your plants are gonna get bigger
[01:47:53.710 --> 01:47:55.790]  and bigger and bigger the longer you veg.
[01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:59.290]  So we're just gonna go for a short veg in this one.
[01:47:59.290 --> 01:48:00.790]  So your flowering phase,
[01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:02.590]  I'm gonna go for a nine week flowering phase.
[01:48:02.590 --> 01:48:06.150]  Most of the plants I work with are about nine to 10 weeks.
[01:48:06.150 --> 01:48:07.550]  Nine weeks is a good number
[01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:09.630]  because that gives us three trimesters
[01:48:09.630 --> 01:48:11.390]  of three weeks each to talk about.
[01:48:11.390 --> 01:48:14.350]  I can talk about my theory of the trimesters on the plants.
[01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:17.190]  So yeah, that'll help us out.
[01:48:17.190 --> 01:48:20.590]  So we got 14 days in seedling, 63 days in flowering.
[01:48:20.590 --> 01:48:21.990]  Are you looking at 77 days there?
[01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:26.350]  That gives us about 30 days to veg and fix any problems.
[01:48:26.350 --> 01:48:31.350]  So let's just basically start a short grow from Cedar Clone.
[01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:33.790]  This is kind of the grow I'm gonna talk about now
[01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:36.550]  is basically the type of grow I would do
[01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:38.870]  if I were searching through a 10 pack of seeds
[01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:40.610]  to find the keepers in the pack.
[01:48:40.610 --> 01:48:43.530]  So for this, I would usually use like a three gallon pot
[01:48:43.530 --> 01:48:44.930]  or a five gallon pot.
[01:48:44.930 --> 01:48:49.130]  And I would use, I don't know, probably like between nine
[01:48:49.130 --> 01:48:51.610]  and 16, just depends on how small I'm gonna keep the plants
[01:48:51.610 --> 01:48:53.130]  and how tight I wanna cramp them in the space
[01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:53.970]  under the light.
[01:48:53.970 --> 01:48:54.810]  And this is just one light
[01:48:54.810 --> 01:48:56.610]  is all I'm talking about right now.
[01:48:56.610 --> 01:48:58.770]  So if we start from seeds or clones,
[01:48:58.770 --> 01:49:00.770]  the only difference will be the first two weeks really.
[01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:03.010]  Once the clones root and the seedlings take off,
[01:49:03.010 --> 01:49:05.050]  everything I'm talking about is gonna work the same
[01:49:05.050 --> 01:49:06.290]  for seeds and clones.
[01:49:06.290 --> 01:49:07.450]  If you're working with seeds,
[01:49:07.450 --> 01:49:09.570]  you'll have to be sure that you eliminate the males
[01:49:09.570 --> 01:49:10.810]  before we get too far into flower,
[01:49:10.810 --> 01:49:12.910]  but that's gonna be your major difference.
[01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:15.130]  So let's start with this.
[01:49:15.130 --> 01:49:16.970]  I will say this is like, if we're starting day one,
[01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:18.290]  we'll say start day one right now.
[01:49:18.290 --> 01:49:20.490]  So today we would cut our clones
[01:49:20.490 --> 01:49:22.890]  and start germinating our seeds.
[01:49:22.890 --> 01:49:24.770]  I'm not gonna do any lessons on germinating seeds
[01:49:24.770 --> 01:49:26.290]  or cutting clones because I'm pretty sure
[01:49:26.290 --> 01:49:28.770]  I've covered that in past episodes.
[01:49:28.770 --> 01:49:30.510]  If you need to refresh your course,
[01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:31.350]  go back and listen to those.
[01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:34.610]  Or if you guys want a brand new episode on that, email me,
[01:49:34.610 --> 01:49:36.170]  and I will go back and listen to the old episode
[01:49:36.170 --> 01:49:37.930]  and I'll try to do an update for you.
[01:49:37.970 --> 01:49:40.010]  But only if enough people ask for it.
[01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:42.250]  That episode's out there, so it should work.
[01:49:42.250 --> 01:49:44.970]  So we cut our clones and we started our seeds for day one.
[01:49:44.970 --> 01:49:46.450]  This is where you wanna mark the date.
[01:49:46.450 --> 01:49:47.890]  Get out your grow calendar and mark it.
[01:49:47.890 --> 01:49:49.610]  Today is day one.
[01:49:49.610 --> 01:49:52.010]  For clones and seeds, I recommend a 24-hour light cycle,
[01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:54.050]  you guys, to start the first couple of weeks.
[01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:56.450]  The first few days are just a waiting game, pretty much.
[01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:59.570]  If you're waiting for seeds, they'll pop up
[01:49:59.570 --> 01:50:01.330]  from whatever medium you've put them in
[01:50:01.330 --> 01:50:02.850]  in like 48 hours, hopefully,
[01:50:02.850 --> 01:50:04.150]  or maybe it'll take them a couple of days
[01:50:04.150 --> 01:50:05.530]  to start growing to the light.
[01:50:05.530 --> 01:50:07.570]  I suggest putting your seedlings into,
[01:50:08.210 --> 01:50:09.770]  I use beer cups, like Solo cups.
[01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:14.490]  Put your seedlings into the cups with a light potting mix
[01:50:14.490 --> 01:50:16.090]  with plenty of drainage and holes in the bottoms
[01:50:16.090 --> 01:50:17.410]  of the cups, of course.
[01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:19.890]  Once your seedlings have developed a nice tap root
[01:50:19.890 --> 01:50:21.530]  of like about an inch to three inches long,
[01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:23.810]  that's when you wanna throw those in your dirt.
[01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:25.330]  So clones will be lazy,
[01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:27.290]  but they'll root around 10 to 14 days.
[01:50:27.290 --> 01:50:28.690]  Some of you guys are gonna take a little longer
[01:50:28.690 --> 01:50:30.050]  to get your clones to root.
[01:50:30.050 --> 01:50:31.430]  It's all about a healthy mother plant,
[01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:32.770]  a good rooting environment.
[01:50:33.610 --> 01:50:35.570]  Be patient, and if it takes you more time
[01:50:35.570 --> 01:50:36.410]  to get your clones rooted,
[01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:38.050]  just plan that into your next run.
[01:50:38.050 --> 01:50:40.050]  Give yourself an extra week or an extra five days,
[01:50:40.050 --> 01:50:41.290]  whatever it takes.
[01:50:41.290 --> 01:50:43.170]  And then you'll start learning how to keep healthy
[01:50:43.170 --> 01:50:44.010]  your mother plants.
[01:50:44.010 --> 01:50:45.290]  You'll start learning how to clone better,
[01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:46.510]  and you'll speed up your cloning time.
[01:50:46.510 --> 01:50:47.970]  It'll get better.
[01:50:47.970 --> 01:50:49.410]  Take a lot of extra clones at first,
[01:50:49.410 --> 01:50:50.230]  because they're gonna die.
[01:50:50.230 --> 01:50:51.130]  If you're not good at cloning,
[01:50:51.130 --> 01:50:53.170]  if you're new at this, take extras,
[01:50:53.170 --> 01:50:56.930]  because you will lose some, and don't be sad about it.
[01:50:56.930 --> 01:50:59.370]  So after several days, let's see, where was I?
[01:50:59.370 --> 01:51:01.610]  The seedlings are gonna start growing tall and skinny
[01:51:01.610 --> 01:51:02.930]  in the first few days.
[01:51:02.930 --> 01:51:05.050]  After several days, they'll develop their first true leaves.
[01:51:05.050 --> 01:51:07.530]  By this time, the clones are rooted and ready for cups,
[01:51:07.530 --> 01:51:08.970]  and the seedlings will be small plants
[01:51:08.970 --> 01:51:10.970]  and catching up to the clones.
[01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:12.170]  So I wouldn't feed the seedlings
[01:51:12.170 --> 01:51:13.930]  until about seven to 10 days in.
[01:51:13.930 --> 01:51:16.170]  And when you do feed them, focus on root inoculant
[01:51:16.170 --> 01:51:18.570]  and building a good root base for the plants.
[01:51:18.570 --> 01:51:21.690]  I like a worm casting tea or something like that,
[01:51:21.690 --> 01:51:23.530]  maybe something like Great White.
[01:51:23.530 --> 01:51:24.530]  You can use OGT.
[01:51:25.610 --> 01:51:28.070]  Something that focuses on root inoculants.
[01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:29.810]  You want Trichoderma.
[01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:32.450]  Yeah, you guys, hopefully you've caught on
[01:51:32.450 --> 01:51:33.970]  to what I'm talking about by now.
[01:51:33.970 --> 01:51:36.530]  We've talked a lot about root inoculant with Sean.
[01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:37.990]  So I would feed the clones the same thing
[01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:39.570]  when you put those into cups.
[01:51:39.570 --> 01:51:42.170]  I definitely like to feed my clones and my seedlings
[01:51:42.170 --> 01:51:45.290]  a lot of root inoculants to get that soil funky
[01:51:45.290 --> 01:51:47.290]  and get the roots fat, fat.
[01:51:47.290 --> 01:51:48.610]  The better roots, the better the fruits
[01:51:48.610 --> 01:51:50.770]  is what I say all the time.
[01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:53.530]  So by now, I feel like we should be
[01:51:53.530 --> 01:51:55.610]  putting our clones into cups and starting week three
[01:51:55.610 --> 01:51:57.770]  if everything went correctly.
[01:51:57.770 --> 01:51:59.610]  We fed the plants once.
[01:51:59.610 --> 01:52:01.490]  This makes me feel like everything is one lesson now,
[01:52:01.490 --> 01:52:02.530]  now that we've gotten to week three
[01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:04.250]  and the clones and the seedlings are caught up.
[01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:05.530]  I feel like there won't be much difference
[01:52:05.530 --> 01:52:07.010]  between the clone and the seedling.
[01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:09.090]  Clone and the seedling, that was hard to say.
[01:52:09.090 --> 01:52:10.450]  The seedlings may grow more quickly
[01:52:10.450 --> 01:52:12.030]  because they have what we call seed vigor,
[01:52:12.030 --> 01:52:15.410]  but that's not always the case if you have good clones.
[01:52:15.410 --> 01:52:17.330]  I've seen some clones outgrow seedlings before
[01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:19.170]  and it's been kind of surprising.
[01:52:19.170 --> 01:52:20.450]  So all we've done up to this point
[01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:22.770]  is pretty much plant our seeds and clones.
[01:52:22.770 --> 01:52:24.970]  We've gotten our starter plants into cups
[01:52:24.970 --> 01:52:27.810]  and we've fed them some worm tea or some root inoculant,
[01:52:27.810 --> 01:52:30.530]  maybe some Great White, maybe some OGT,
[01:52:30.530 --> 01:52:33.210]  something like that to get them started.
[01:52:33.210 --> 01:52:35.410]  And now I'm going to call this the beginning of veg.
[01:52:35.410 --> 01:52:37.370]  Some people may call it pre-veg
[01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:40.570]  because we haven't gone into our big pots yet,
[01:52:40.570 --> 01:52:42.770]  but I'm going to call it veg starting now.
[01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:44.210]  Now that we've gotten out of the cloner,
[01:52:44.210 --> 01:52:46.410]  now that we're not little baby seedlings anymore,
[01:52:46.410 --> 01:52:48.450]  I'm going to say we're into veg.
[01:52:48.450 --> 01:52:51.250]  So the veg state can last as long as you want.
[01:52:51.250 --> 01:52:52.890]  The longer you veg, like I said earlier,
[01:52:52.890 --> 01:52:55.330]  the larger your plants are going to get.
[01:52:55.330 --> 01:52:58.490]  The veg phase is where we do 90% of the topping,
[01:52:58.490 --> 01:53:01.170]  training and pruning of your plants.
[01:53:01.170 --> 01:53:03.130]  We kind of did a lesson on topping and stuff like that,
[01:53:03.130 --> 01:53:04.890]  but I plan to do another episode
[01:53:04.890 --> 01:53:06.450]  all about improving your crops
[01:53:06.450 --> 01:53:08.490]  and improving your yields and things.
[01:53:08.490 --> 01:53:10.770]  So that'll come in handy.
[01:53:10.770 --> 01:53:13.490]  Also, your plants are going to take up 90% of the nitrogen
[01:53:13.490 --> 01:53:15.210]  that they use through their entire lives
[01:53:15.210 --> 01:53:19.210]  during the vegetative phase of their plants.
[01:53:19.210 --> 01:53:20.890]  People tend to really overlook the veg phase
[01:53:20.890 --> 01:53:22.650]  and they focus only on the bloom phase
[01:53:22.650 --> 01:53:24.130]  because that's when you can see your buds,
[01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:27.650]  but the veg phase is just as important.
[01:53:27.650 --> 01:53:29.210]  And so is your veg space, you guys.
[01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:30.570]  A lot of people don't spend the time
[01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:32.370]  building a proper veg room,
[01:53:32.370 --> 01:53:33.930]  and it really would help you out.
[01:53:33.930 --> 01:53:36.090]  If you teach those kids how to run
[01:53:36.090 --> 01:53:37.330]  before you put them on the track,
[01:53:37.330 --> 01:53:39.250]  they'd be a lot better performing kid.
[01:53:39.250 --> 01:53:41.170]  So I feel like if we use each day
[01:53:41.170 --> 01:53:43.290]  as a chance to prepare the plants for bloom,
[01:53:43.290 --> 01:53:45.930]  our crop will look much better at harvest time.
[01:53:47.010 --> 01:53:48.770]  My veg phase for my example of this grow
[01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:51.050]  is going to be short, you guys.
[01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:51.890]  Gosh, give me one second.
[01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:53.010]  I'm going to press pause and take a drink.
[01:53:53.010 --> 01:53:54.130]  I'll probably take a dab while I'm there.
[01:53:54.130 --> 01:53:55.730]  Excuse me for one second.
[01:53:55.730 --> 01:53:56.570]  All right, guys.
[01:53:56.570 --> 01:53:59.370]  We are at the beginning of veg is where I left off.
[01:53:59.370 --> 01:54:02.130]  So I like to feed my plants the first day of each week.
[01:54:02.130 --> 01:54:04.810]  Mondays are usually my feeding day for my personal crops.
[01:54:04.810 --> 01:54:06.290]  For me, starting everything on a Monday
[01:54:06.290 --> 01:54:08.090]  helps me keep track of everything.
[01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:10.130]  So on the first day of veg,
[01:54:10.130 --> 01:54:12.250]  I would feed my plants a nice base nutrient,
[01:54:12.250 --> 01:54:14.050]  a light humic acid,
[01:54:14.050 --> 01:54:17.210]  some potassium silicates to build strong cell walls,
[01:54:17.210 --> 01:54:20.210]  and I would also keep focusing on root development.
[01:54:20.210 --> 01:54:22.050]  We shouldn't need any cow mag or anything like that
[01:54:22.050 --> 01:54:23.450]  for the first couple of weeks.
[01:54:23.450 --> 01:54:24.410]  Everything should be cool.
[01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:25.970]  So for the first couple of weeks,
[01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:27.410]  your plant should be cool in the cups,
[01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:28.610]  but we're going to have to plant them
[01:54:28.610 --> 01:54:30.450]  into larger pots pretty soon.
[01:54:30.450 --> 01:54:32.410]  You don't want to see them get root bound in those cups,
[01:54:32.410 --> 01:54:33.610]  and they'll also get tall and skinny.
[01:54:33.610 --> 01:54:35.130]  We want them to bush out a little bit.
[01:54:35.130 --> 01:54:36.450]  So when we put them into a larger pot,
[01:54:36.450 --> 01:54:37.770]  they'll start bushing out.
[01:54:37.770 --> 01:54:40.330]  So it's also a good time to adjust your lights
[01:54:40.330 --> 01:54:43.370]  from 24 hours to an 18-6 schedule.
[01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:46.570]  You want them on for 18 hours, off for six.
[01:54:46.570 --> 01:54:47.570]  Plants like a rest period,
[01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:50.650]  and it's also going to save you money on your energy bill.
[01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:52.490]  So now you've got your plants into cups.
[01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:53.870]  They're nice and healthy.
[01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:55.450]  They're starting to kind of grow a little bit.
[01:54:55.970 --> 01:54:57.370]  They've got nice roots.
[01:54:57.370 --> 01:54:59.090]  We're about three weeks in.
[01:54:59.090 --> 01:55:01.210]  I think by the fourth week is when we should start
[01:55:01.210 --> 01:55:03.970]  putting everything into larger pots.
[01:55:03.970 --> 01:55:05.170]  If we leave them in the cups too long,
[01:55:05.170 --> 01:55:06.010]  they're going to get root bound.
[01:55:06.010 --> 01:55:07.370]  They're going to start getting stretchy.
[01:55:07.370 --> 01:55:09.090]  And also when you put them into bigger pots,
[01:55:09.090 --> 01:55:11.490]  they can go a little bit longer without needing water.
[01:55:11.490 --> 01:55:13.010]  So that'll help you out too.
[01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:14.770]  So if you're going to veg for a couple extra weeks
[01:55:14.770 --> 01:55:17.930]  and you have time and space, go for bigger pots.
[01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:20.170]  For my example, we're just going to do a quick crop
[01:55:20.170 --> 01:55:21.650]  and we're going to use three gallon pots
[01:55:21.650 --> 01:55:22.890]  and they'll be just fine.
[01:55:23.890 --> 01:55:25.890]  So carefully put everything from your cups
[01:55:25.890 --> 01:55:27.730]  into a three gallon pot or a larger pot,
[01:55:27.730 --> 01:55:29.970]  whichever you're going to use.
[01:55:29.970 --> 01:55:31.890]  And I think I've talked about transplanting.
[01:55:31.890 --> 01:55:33.450]  I think I've talked a little bit about doing that.
[01:55:33.450 --> 01:55:35.250]  So if you guys need help transplanting, let me know,
[01:55:35.250 --> 01:55:36.210]  and I'll talk more about that,
[01:55:36.210 --> 01:55:37.890]  but I'm pretty sure I've covered it.
[01:55:37.890 --> 01:55:41.110]  So carefully put everything into a larger pot and feed them.
[01:55:42.250 --> 01:55:44.590]  We should be about week four, maybe into week five by now.
[01:55:44.590 --> 01:55:45.930]  You guys, I hope you started doing these
[01:55:45.930 --> 01:55:47.730]  into pots around week four.
[01:55:47.730 --> 01:55:49.710]  I hope you didn't wait too long.
[01:55:49.710 --> 01:55:51.690]  So feed them and you're going to feed them
[01:55:51.690 --> 01:55:53.890]  a strong dose of root inoculant, of course.
[01:55:53.890 --> 01:55:55.290]  We're always going to do that through veg,
[01:55:55.290 --> 01:55:57.490]  right up to kind of the start of flower.
[01:55:57.490 --> 01:55:59.170]  Feed them a veg-based nutrient.
[01:55:59.170 --> 01:56:01.970]  I use, if I'm using bottled nutrients for this,
[01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:05.690]  I would recommend Botanicare Pure Blend Pro Soil Formula,
[01:56:05.690 --> 01:56:07.410]  the Grow Formula.
[01:56:07.410 --> 01:56:09.570]  They don't pay me to say that, it's just what I use.
[01:56:09.570 --> 01:56:13.210]  I would use some humic acid in there for this grow.
[01:56:13.210 --> 01:56:15.250]  For my recommendation, if you're using bottles,
[01:56:15.250 --> 01:56:17.650]  I would say Liquid Karma from Botanicare.
[01:56:17.650 --> 01:56:18.890]  I would use a fulvic acid,
[01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:21.590]  which Organicare sells a liquid fulvic acid
[01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:23.910]  that works great for this.
[01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:25.790]  I would use some CalMag at this point, you guys.
[01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:28.390]  You're going to start needing some CalMag in there.
[01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:30.390]  A very light dose of CalMag to start
[01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:34.170]  because your babies aren't ready for it just yet possibly,
[01:56:34.170 --> 01:56:35.230]  and I don't want you to burn them.
[01:56:35.230 --> 01:56:38.470]  So be careful with that CalMag, but it's about to be time.
[01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:41.030]  I would also recommend something to feed the microbes,
[01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:44.370]  basic molasses or something like Humboldt honey
[01:56:44.370 --> 01:56:45.950]  or something like that.
[01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:47.550]  Hybri would be good.
[01:56:47.550 --> 01:56:51.190]  Anything like that with a lot of molasses-y type stuff there.
[01:56:52.030 --> 01:56:53.710]  Now our plants are in their final pots.
[01:56:53.710 --> 01:56:54.750]  They've been fed.
[01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:56.670]  These plants can be topped or super cropped
[01:56:56.670 --> 01:56:58.350]  or manipulated into a screen of grain
[01:56:58.350 --> 01:57:00.430]  or whatever you have planned for them.
[01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:01.870]  Just make sure that if you're going to do
[01:57:01.870 --> 01:57:04.070]  any topping or pruning,
[01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:05.910]  do that about 10 to 14 days
[01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:07.870]  before you start flowering the plants.
[01:57:07.870 --> 01:57:09.910]  Your plants need a little bit of time to recover
[01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:11.430]  after you've topped them.
[01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:13.950]  Plants are apical dominant, which means they want to top.
[01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:15.150]  So after you've cut the tops,
[01:57:15.150 --> 01:57:17.470]  the hormones have to move around.
[01:57:17.470 --> 01:57:18.630]  It's got to move hormones around.
[01:57:18.630 --> 01:57:20.770]  You want those hormones built up in the tips of your plants
[01:57:20.770 --> 01:57:22.290]  before you flower them.
[01:57:22.290 --> 01:57:23.510]  It's really helpful for your plants.
[01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:25.890]  If you start topping stuff and pruning things
[01:57:25.890 --> 01:57:26.730]  and then flower right away,
[01:57:26.730 --> 01:57:27.970]  you're just going to make little tiny buds
[01:57:27.970 --> 01:57:29.590]  and confuse the shit out of your plant.
[01:57:29.590 --> 01:57:31.330]  You'll be disappointed.
[01:57:31.330 --> 01:57:35.050]  So now that we are in our bigger pots and we fed everything,
[01:57:35.050 --> 01:57:37.330]  I'm going to say we are in full veg mode.
[01:57:37.330 --> 01:57:38.950]  We have our plants in the finishing pots.
[01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:40.450]  Things have been topped and super cropped.
[01:57:40.450 --> 01:57:42.850]  We've got our lights on a veg schedule of 18 on
[01:57:42.850 --> 01:57:44.210]  and six hours off.
[01:57:44.210 --> 01:57:46.410]  We should be feeding a solid veg recipe
[01:57:46.410 --> 01:57:47.670]  at the start of every week
[01:57:47.670 --> 01:57:50.530]  and watching for any signs of bug problems.
[01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:53.490]  It'd be a good idea to start a bug prevention regimen by now
[01:57:53.490 --> 01:57:54.930]  if you haven't already started spraying
[01:57:54.930 --> 01:57:57.330]  or doing something to keep the mites away.
[01:57:57.330 --> 01:57:59.250]  Neem oil is a great way to prevent bugs
[01:57:59.250 --> 01:58:00.310]  while you're in veg,
[01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:04.250]  but do not ever spray a flowering plant with neem oil.
[01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:06.530]  One application of neem oil on a flowering plant
[01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:07.890]  will ruin the entire thing.
[01:58:07.890 --> 01:58:09.810]  The flavor will be miserable.
[01:58:09.810 --> 01:58:12.690]  If you make extracts, they will taste like neem oil.
[01:58:12.690 --> 01:58:14.410]  Just please don't do that, you guys.
[01:58:14.410 --> 01:58:17.050]  Don't spray anything on your flowering plants,
[01:58:17.050 --> 01:58:19.530]  any bug sprays or anything on your flowering plants.
[01:58:19.530 --> 01:58:21.850]  If you're going to spray stuff on flowering plants,
[01:58:21.850 --> 01:58:26.170]  make sure it's a well, well thought out foliar feed, please.
[01:58:28.770 --> 01:58:30.610]  Yeah, I think I can write a whole separate rant
[01:58:30.610 --> 01:58:32.170]  on pest management in another episode.
[01:58:32.170 --> 01:58:35.130]  So I said that we should feed on Monday of every week.
[01:58:35.130 --> 01:58:35.970]  That's my opinion.
[01:58:35.970 --> 01:58:37.130]  I like to feed on Monday.
[01:58:37.130 --> 01:58:38.730]  I mix up nutrients.
[01:58:38.730 --> 01:58:42.170]  I mix up a nice reservoir of nutrients and feed the plants.
[01:58:42.170 --> 01:58:44.770]  Every Monday, they get a nice healthy feed.
[01:58:44.770 --> 01:58:46.650]  And then usually by Wednesday or Thursday,
[01:58:46.650 --> 01:58:48.850]  they need more, they need a water.
[01:58:48.850 --> 01:58:51.570]  So I'll just feed them clean pH balanced water
[01:58:51.570 --> 01:58:53.130]  with no nutrients in it.
[01:58:53.130 --> 01:58:54.410]  I'll just feed them that.
[01:58:54.410 --> 01:58:57.890]  And then on Monday again, I will give them nutrients.
[01:58:57.890 --> 01:58:59.450]  And then the next time that they're thirsty,
[01:58:59.450 --> 01:59:01.450]  probably that next Wednesday or Thursday,
[01:59:01.450 --> 01:59:04.290]  they will get a fully organic worm tea
[01:59:04.290 --> 01:59:06.850]  that I have brewed for like 36 hours.
[01:59:06.850 --> 01:59:09.930]  I'll put worm castings in there, I'll put grokashi in there.
[01:59:09.930 --> 01:59:13.450]  I'll put a little bit of Dragonflight Earth Medicine,
[01:59:13.450 --> 01:59:14.810]  the lush roots in there,
[01:59:14.810 --> 01:59:17.690]  put a little bit of fish hydroslate, I put some sea crop.
[01:59:18.970 --> 01:59:20.090]  And then I'll feed my plants that.
[01:59:20.090 --> 01:59:23.090]  And they get fed teas probably twice in veg
[01:59:23.090 --> 01:59:25.570]  and probably three times during the flower phase.
[01:59:25.570 --> 01:59:27.530]  And I think it makes a huge difference
[01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:29.330]  because I make a pretty awesome tea
[01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:31.170]  that Sean taught me how to make.
[01:59:31.170 --> 01:59:32.250]  I really think it makes a difference.
[01:59:32.250 --> 01:59:34.450]  So that's kind of my feeding idea.
[01:59:34.450 --> 01:59:36.050]  I don't think I've ever broken down
[01:59:36.050 --> 01:59:38.170]  my week to week feeding schedule.
[01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:40.530]  I don't want to be responsible for your weekly feeding.
[01:59:40.530 --> 01:59:42.090]  I kind of want to let you experiment
[01:59:42.090 --> 01:59:43.090]  and find what works for you.
[01:59:43.090 --> 01:59:46.330]  But if you've got questions about specific nutrients,
[01:59:46.330 --> 01:59:48.490]  let me know and I'll do my best to figure out
[01:59:49.130 --> 01:59:51.410]  how to incorporate that into your growth for you.
[01:59:51.410 --> 01:59:53.170]  That's going to take a lot of work.
[01:59:53.170 --> 01:59:54.130]  So like I was saying earlier,
[01:59:54.130 --> 01:59:55.330]  we can veg as long as we want.
[01:59:55.330 --> 01:59:58.090]  For my example, we're going to veg for about 30 days.
[01:59:58.090 --> 01:59:59.450]  You can top and manipulate the plants
[01:59:59.450 --> 02:00:01.010]  as much as you want while in veg.
[02:00:01.010 --> 02:00:01.850]  Did I already read this?
[02:00:01.850 --> 02:00:06.850]  No, but I would stop topping about two weeks before flowering.
[02:00:06.970 --> 02:00:09.130]  My shorter crops don't really get much topping
[02:00:09.130 --> 02:00:09.970]  and pruning you guys.
[02:00:09.970 --> 02:00:10.930]  If I'm running a seed crop
[02:00:10.930 --> 02:00:12.770]  and I want to see what the seedlings are,
[02:00:12.770 --> 02:00:14.610]  I really don't top much.
[02:00:14.610 --> 02:00:17.370]  I take two clones from each plant just before I flower it.
[02:00:17.370 --> 02:00:19.770]  I clean up the bottoms just a little bit.
[02:00:19.770 --> 02:00:21.210]  And then once I flower,
[02:00:21.210 --> 02:00:22.770]  I clean up the bottoms once I flower,
[02:00:22.770 --> 02:00:25.250]  but my small crops really don't get much topping or pruning.
[02:00:25.250 --> 02:00:28.090]  I try to get the test crops just in and out quickly
[02:00:28.090 --> 02:00:29.810]  so I can see what I'm working with.
[02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:31.850]  Because if I've got a bunch of boys in there
[02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:33.690]  or if I don't see the traits I'm looking for,
[02:00:33.690 --> 02:00:34.970]  then I just want to get that out of there
[02:00:34.970 --> 02:00:36.290]  and scrap it as soon as possible.
[02:00:36.290 --> 02:00:38.930]  I'm looking for specific traits at this point.
[02:00:38.930 --> 02:00:42.090]  So the next 30 days while we're in veg,
[02:00:42.090 --> 02:00:43.930]  basically we need to watch for bugs,
[02:00:43.930 --> 02:00:45.090]  watch for problems,
[02:00:45.090 --> 02:00:48.130]  and keep the plants as healthy and happy as possible.
[02:00:48.130 --> 02:00:51.850]  So I suggest checking each plant every single day.
[02:00:51.850 --> 02:00:53.050]  I know that sounds ridiculous,
[02:00:53.050 --> 02:00:54.490]  but however many plants you've got,
[02:00:54.490 --> 02:00:55.610]  you should be in there,
[02:00:55.610 --> 02:00:57.930]  you should touch every plant every single day.
[02:00:57.930 --> 02:00:59.570]  That's how you know you're growing from your heart.
[02:00:59.570 --> 02:01:01.970]  That's how you know you've got solid medicine
[02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:04.290]  that doesn't need to be sprayed with EGLE 20.
[02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:06.170]  That's how you know that if you do see a problem,
[02:01:06.170 --> 02:01:08.370]  you'll be on top of it and you'll be able to cure it.
[02:01:08.370 --> 02:01:09.730]  You'll be able to solve the problem
[02:01:09.730 --> 02:01:11.490]  before it gets out of control.
[02:01:11.490 --> 02:01:14.170]  That's super important being a good gardener.
[02:01:14.170 --> 02:01:16.090]  So I suggest checking each day
[02:01:16.090 --> 02:01:18.050]  and make notes of what you see.
[02:01:18.050 --> 02:01:19.970]  If you see anything that stands out to you,
[02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:20.810]  make a note of it.
[02:01:20.810 --> 02:01:22.530]  If it's good, if it's bad, if it's weird,
[02:01:22.530 --> 02:01:25.170]  if you're not sure, if it's new, if it's questionable,
[02:01:25.170 --> 02:01:28.730]  make a note and don't forget
[02:01:28.730 --> 02:01:30.050]  because I know you're gonna say,
[02:01:30.050 --> 02:01:32.210]  I'll remember shit, the notes are in my head.
[02:01:32.210 --> 02:01:35.010]  Dude, we're potheads, we're pot growers, we're dabbers.
[02:01:35.010 --> 02:01:36.010]  You're gonna forget.
[02:01:36.010 --> 02:01:38.090]  You're gonna forget something, write it down.
[02:01:38.090 --> 02:01:41.210]  And when maybe one day you're gonna wanna run a business
[02:01:41.210 --> 02:01:42.410]  and the guy with the notes
[02:01:42.410 --> 02:01:43.930]  will get the opportunity to run a business
[02:01:44.730 --> 02:01:45.570]  and you'll be over the guy
[02:01:45.570 --> 02:01:46.410]  with a head full of bullshit and ideas.
[02:01:46.410 --> 02:01:47.250]  You've written something down
[02:01:47.250 --> 02:01:48.090]  that shows you've done something.
[02:01:48.090 --> 02:01:50.370]  The other guy's like, I remember doing this.
[02:01:50.370 --> 02:01:51.650]  The people that are hiring you
[02:01:51.650 --> 02:01:53.410]  to be their master grower at their dispensary
[02:01:53.410 --> 02:01:54.970]  don't want your hopes and dreams in your head.
[02:01:54.970 --> 02:01:56.210]  They wanna see it on paper.
[02:01:56.210 --> 02:01:58.570]  If you take notes, you got something that's documented.
[02:01:58.570 --> 02:02:00.370]  And now that it's legal, you don't have to worry about it.
[02:02:00.370 --> 02:02:02.730]  I understand the old school growers didn't want any notes.
[02:02:02.730 --> 02:02:03.790]  I get it, but now we can.
[02:02:03.790 --> 02:02:06.690]  So set a date for your flowering cycle
[02:02:06.690 --> 02:02:08.330]  is what I think you should do.
[02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:09.650]  Decide how long you wanna veg,
[02:02:09.650 --> 02:02:11.770]  set a date for your flowering cycle,
[02:02:11.770 --> 02:02:14.770]  and then commit to that and veg for that long.
[02:02:14.770 --> 02:02:17.530]  Get your plants trimmed up, get them pruned, get them topped.
[02:02:17.530 --> 02:02:19.090]  If you're gonna put them in a screen of green,
[02:02:19.090 --> 02:02:20.650]  like Spence taught us about,
[02:02:20.650 --> 02:02:24.050]  put them in the screen of green and get them nice and happy.
[02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:27.050]  And then we'll get them ready for the flowering cycle.
[02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:28.890]  I've gone for 30 minutes
[02:02:28.890 --> 02:02:32.610]  and I don't think I can get enough of the flowering cycle
[02:02:32.610 --> 02:02:36.210]  to make it worth your listen in to this episode.
[02:02:36.210 --> 02:02:38.770]  So I think we're just gonna start wrapping up the show
[02:02:38.770 --> 02:02:39.610]  at 30 minutes.
[02:02:39.610 --> 02:02:41.050]  You guys really listen a lot
[02:02:41.050 --> 02:02:42.250]  when I put out shorter episodes.
[02:02:42.250 --> 02:02:44.970]  You don't seem to get the attention deficit disorder.
[02:02:44.970 --> 02:02:46.450]  So we're just gonna do a short episode here.
[02:02:46.450 --> 02:02:47.730]  I appreciate you guys for listening.
[02:02:47.730 --> 02:02:49.610]  I will come back in a week
[02:02:49.610 --> 02:02:51.730]  and I will have a solid lesson
[02:02:51.730 --> 02:02:54.230]  about the flowering schedule for you.
[02:02:54.230 --> 02:02:56.330]  I hope to get Spence on an upcoming episode.
[02:02:56.330 --> 02:02:58.690]  I was talking to Sean and he'll be back in the future.
[02:02:58.690 --> 02:02:59.650]  I've got an episode coming up
[02:02:59.650 --> 02:03:01.330]  about how to improve your garden.
[02:03:01.330 --> 02:03:02.530]  I've got a lot of things planned, you guys.
[02:03:02.530 --> 02:03:03.790]  I'm really getting back on my game.
[02:03:03.790 --> 02:03:05.930]  So I'm getting more lessons written down,
[02:03:05.930 --> 02:03:07.090]  getting more episodes planned.
[02:03:07.090 --> 02:03:09.610]  I appreciate you sticking through my rough patch there
[02:03:09.650 --> 02:03:11.650]  while I had to do some sloppy episodes.
[02:03:12.970 --> 02:03:15.650]  Big thanks to everybody who sent me well wishes
[02:03:15.650 --> 02:03:16.730]  on taking care of my head,
[02:03:16.730 --> 02:03:17.850]  wishing me better on my head.
[02:03:17.850 --> 02:03:19.250]  I feel much better.
[02:03:19.250 --> 02:03:20.650]  I'd like to say I'm about,
[02:03:20.650 --> 02:03:21.730]  I kept saying I was 90%,
[02:03:21.730 --> 02:03:23.090]  you know, I'm about 85% back.
[02:03:23.090 --> 02:03:24.090]  I keep noticing,
[02:03:24.970 --> 02:03:27.130]  sometimes I'll say the wrong word in a sentence.
[02:03:27.130 --> 02:03:30.050]  The other day I told somebody that I was going to
[02:03:30.050 --> 02:03:33.450]  eat this banana and I was actually holding a burrito
[02:03:33.450 --> 02:03:36.130]  and I didn't even realize that I kept saying banana,
[02:03:36.130 --> 02:03:37.810]  but it was a burrito and they corrected me.
[02:03:37.810 --> 02:03:39.590]  And I said, yeah, this banana is tasty.
[02:03:40.570 --> 02:03:41.590]  And they're like, it's a fucking burrito, dude.
[02:03:41.590 --> 02:03:43.150]  So I realized I was doing that.
[02:03:44.430 --> 02:03:47.390]  I was describing something that was purple
[02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:49.070]  and I called it orange.
[02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:52.110]  And I know I did that, but I don't, yeah.
[02:03:52.110 --> 02:03:53.750]  So there's stuff like that that's going on in my head
[02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:55.270]  that's still a little bit goofy.
[02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:56.950]  And sometimes I forget my password still
[02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:58.190]  when I try to log into my computer,
[02:03:58.190 --> 02:03:59.670]  but I'm getting it back together.
[02:03:59.670 --> 02:04:01.430]  So I do appreciate you guys sticking with me through that.
[02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:02.990]  It's been a really scary time,
[02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:05.030]  but I feel like I'm coming back together.
[02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:06.670]  So let's wrap up the show guys.
[02:04:06.670 --> 02:04:08.130]  I'm fucking rambly today.
[02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:11.350]  Where is that part that I read?
[02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:13.010]  Oh yeah, it says, thanks for listening to another episode.
[02:04:13.010 --> 02:04:14.550]  I'll be back in another week.
[02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:15.770]  Don't forget to check out the sponsors.
[02:04:15.770 --> 02:04:18.530]  I didn't do much ads because I wanted to get the show going.

[02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:05.450]  I could use a new microphone.
[02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:06.870]  I could use these microphone covers.
[02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:08.170]  This one's all grimy.
[02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:10.230]  Yeah, no begging.
[02:05:10.230 --> 02:05:13.510]  Just if it's something on your mind, I would appreciate it.

[02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:26.490]  I post a lot of sweet cannabis photography there.
[02:05:26.490 --> 02:05:29.890]  I've recently joined, what's it called, Mass Roots,
[02:05:29.890 --> 02:05:31.350]  but I'm not getting much response,
[02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:33.730]  so I may quit posting there eventually,
[02:05:33.730 --> 02:05:35.790]  but definitely check me out on Instagram.
[02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:37.190]  You guys, huge shout-out to my ninja spence.
[02:05:37.190 --> 02:05:38.150]  Thanks again for listening.
[02:05:38.150 --> 02:05:39.950]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:41.510]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:05:58.510 --> 02:05:59.990]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:01.870]  It's time for episode number 69
[02:06:01.870 --> 02:06:03.550]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[02:06:03.550 --> 02:06:07.830]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:08.950]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:10.070]  if you're a professional grower,
[02:06:10.070 --> 02:06:12.050]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[02:06:12.050 --> 02:06:13.670]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[02:06:13.670 --> 02:06:15.870]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[02:06:15.870 --> 02:06:18.710]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[02:06:18.710 --> 02:06:19.550]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[02:06:19.550 --> 02:06:21.070]  Thanks again for joining me.
[02:06:21.070 --> 02:06:23.070]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout-out
[02:06:23.070 --> 02:06:24.030]  to the Mystic Roots Band
[02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:25.850]  for letting me use their music on the show.
[02:06:25.850 --> 02:06:30.030]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[02:06:30.030 --> 02:06:30.870]  What's up, guys?
[02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:31.750]  I'm back with another solo episode.
[02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:33.150]  Nobody's hanging out with me today.
[02:06:33.150 --> 02:06:34.430]  It's me all by myself.
[02:06:34.430 --> 02:06:35.910]  Before we get too far,
[02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:37.990]  I do need to send you guys a huge apology.
[02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:39.950]  I know that there was an issue
[02:06:39.950 --> 02:06:41.670]  with the last episode I posted to Stitcher,
[02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:43.830]  but it has since been corrected.
[02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:45.510]  I'm gonna drop down that music a little bit.
[02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:46.750]  I'm gonna repeat that.
[02:06:46.750 --> 02:06:49.470]  The last episode I posted to Stitcher went up,
[02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:50.950]  it went to iTunes, it went to Stitcher,
[02:06:51.790 --> 02:06:52.630]  it went to the website.
[02:06:52.630 --> 02:06:53.450]  Everything went perfectly,
[02:06:53.450 --> 02:06:55.190]  but for some reason, when Stitcher grabbed it,
[02:06:55.190 --> 02:06:58.310]  it only took the first 14 or 15 minutes of it.
[02:06:58.310 --> 02:07:00.070]  So for the first couple of days of the week,
[02:07:00.070 --> 02:07:03.270]  you guys were only able to access a 15-minute episode.
[02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:05.270]  Right when the grow lesson came in, everything cut off.
[02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:07.110]  I apologize for that.
[02:07:07.110 --> 02:07:08.070]  Stitcher got it fixed.
[02:07:08.070 --> 02:07:09.310]  It took them a couple of days,
[02:07:09.310 --> 02:07:10.870]  but Stitcher did repair that for me.
[02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:12.950]  So a big shout-out to Stitcher.
[02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:14.390]  Big thanks to everybody who went back
[02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:15.870]  and listened to that episode.
[02:07:15.870 --> 02:07:19.650]  If you guys tried to listen and gave up because it sucked,
[02:07:19.650 --> 02:07:22.130]  go back and the whole episode is there now.
[02:07:22.130 --> 02:07:23.890]  It's a 30-something minute episode.
[02:07:23.890 --> 02:07:26.170]  We cover most of veg growth.
[02:07:26.170 --> 02:07:27.970]  So now that that's out of the way,
[02:07:27.970 --> 02:07:30.370]  let's move forward with the show.
[02:07:30.370 --> 02:07:32.530]  I received a question that I wanna answer.
[02:07:32.530 --> 02:07:33.530]  It'll be real quick.
[02:07:33.530 --> 02:07:34.350]  Somebody asked me,
[02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:37.050]  why do you turn off the lights during your foliar feeding?
[02:07:38.810 --> 02:07:40.930]  When I'm using a bug spray or a foliar feed,
[02:07:40.930 --> 02:07:42.890]  I turn off the lights because
[02:07:43.810 --> 02:07:45.530]  when you spray the plants with a liquid,
[02:07:45.530 --> 02:07:47.010]  it makes little bubbles on there, right?
[02:07:47.010 --> 02:07:49.170]  And then you've got these high-intensity discharge lights
[02:07:49.690 --> 02:07:50.530]  right above them.
[02:07:50.530 --> 02:07:54.050]  And it works the same way as if you took a magnifying glass
[02:07:54.050 --> 02:07:56.730]  and shown the sun through it.
[02:07:56.730 --> 02:07:59.090]  It makes that little, I call it a reflector bubble.
[02:07:59.090 --> 02:08:01.530]  And the magnifying glass and the sun work,
[02:08:01.530 --> 02:08:03.010]  and it makes that little dot on shit,
[02:08:03.010 --> 02:08:03.850]  and then it burns it.
[02:08:03.850 --> 02:08:06.210]  It'll create, you can catch paper on fire.
[02:08:06.210 --> 02:08:08.170]  When I was a kid, I remember we used to burn ants and shit
[02:08:08.170 --> 02:08:10.650]  with the magnifying glass using the sun.
[02:08:10.650 --> 02:08:12.770]  The bubble on your plants will do the exact same thing.
[02:08:12.770 --> 02:08:14.290]  It'll create that magnifier bubble.
[02:08:14.290 --> 02:08:15.490]  The light will hit it.
[02:08:15.490 --> 02:08:18.530]  It'll intensify the light beam into one spot on your plant,
[02:08:18.530 --> 02:08:20.450]  and it will actually create a little burn mark
[02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:21.690]  on your plant.
[02:08:21.690 --> 02:08:23.930]  So if you're using a foliar feed or a bug spray,
[02:08:23.930 --> 02:08:26.130]  I fully recommend you turn off the lights.
[02:08:26.130 --> 02:08:28.250]  It's ideal to do it right before the lights go out
[02:08:28.250 --> 02:08:31.410]  if you can, but sometimes we have jobs and shit
[02:08:31.410 --> 02:08:32.370]  that prevent us from doing that.
[02:08:32.370 --> 02:08:35.290]  So that is why I turn off the lights when I foliar feed,
[02:08:35.290 --> 02:08:37.090]  and that's why I recommend you turn off the lights
[02:08:37.090 --> 02:08:39.690]  when you foliar feed or bug spray.
[02:08:39.690 --> 02:08:41.730]  Let's see, what's going on in my world?
[02:08:41.730 --> 02:08:43.530]  Man, I was at the spot yesterday.
[02:08:43.530 --> 02:08:45.490]  I spent a couple hours out at the spot dispensary
[02:08:45.490 --> 02:08:47.970]  in Pueblo West, and things are really moving forward.
[02:08:48.410 --> 02:08:51.090]  I should be out there growing cannabis very soon.
[02:08:51.090 --> 02:08:54.570]  Mainly we're waiting for inspections from the city.
[02:08:54.570 --> 02:08:57.090]  We need a couple of small more.
[02:08:57.090 --> 02:08:59.330]  We need, not important stuff.
[02:08:59.330 --> 02:09:01.530]  We need a few small steps to get through
[02:09:01.530 --> 02:09:04.090]  before I'm able to put plants in the spot dispensary
[02:09:04.090 --> 02:09:05.970]  and start growing recreational cannabis
[02:09:05.970 --> 02:09:08.170]  that you will be able to come try.
[02:09:08.170 --> 02:09:09.130]  That's right, I'll let you guys know
[02:09:09.130 --> 02:09:10.450]  when the plants are in there.
[02:09:10.450 --> 02:09:11.810]  I'll let you know when we put them into flower.
[02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:13.770]  I'll let you guys know when they're ready.
[02:09:13.770 --> 02:09:16.410]  I'll let you guys know when you can come get it.
[02:09:16.410 --> 02:09:18.010]  Also, before we get to the grow lesson,
[02:09:18.010 --> 02:09:20.170]  I wanted to talk about how much I feel
[02:09:20.170 --> 02:09:22.530]  like my head is improving.
[02:09:22.530 --> 02:09:23.470]  If you guys follow the show,
[02:09:23.470 --> 02:09:24.730]  you know that at the beginning of April,
[02:09:24.730 --> 02:09:27.410]  I hit my head, I had a serious concussion.
[02:09:27.410 --> 02:09:29.250]  A few episodes at the beginning of April,
[02:09:29.250 --> 02:09:30.450]  mid-April were a little bit,
[02:09:30.450 --> 02:09:32.210]  I'm gonna say they were shitty in my opinion.
[02:09:32.210 --> 02:09:35.610]  I know they were not up to the standard I have created.
[02:09:35.610 --> 02:09:38.330]  They did not follow the format that I've created.
[02:09:38.330 --> 02:09:40.370]  But honestly, I was not in my head.
[02:09:40.370 --> 02:09:42.890]  I was recovering from a major head wound.
[02:09:42.890 --> 02:09:44.530]  But the good part is,
[02:09:44.530 --> 02:09:46.730]  I feel like I'm getting my shit together.
[02:09:46.730 --> 02:09:49.410]  It's been a week since I sat down to record
[02:09:49.410 --> 02:09:50.890]  and it came together.
[02:09:50.890 --> 02:09:52.850]  The recording equipment came together easily.
[02:09:52.850 --> 02:09:55.890]  My podcast notes came together easily.
[02:09:55.890 --> 02:09:57.330]  The notes that I wrote last week,
[02:09:57.330 --> 02:10:00.450]  I brushed them up and made a lot more sense out of them.
[02:10:00.450 --> 02:10:02.990]  So the good part is I feel like I'm getting back together.
[02:10:02.990 --> 02:10:05.850]  I wanna thank you guys for sticking with me
[02:10:05.850 --> 02:10:08.250]  through my head injury while I've been kind of a shithead.
[02:10:08.250 --> 02:10:10.330]  I have not been all here and I know that.
[02:10:10.330 --> 02:10:12.370]  I appreciate you guys that have not abandoned me
[02:10:12.370 --> 02:10:14.010]  and my show through that time.
[02:10:14.010 --> 02:10:15.090]  That's cool of you.
[02:10:15.090 --> 02:10:16.770]  Also extra huge shout out to all the people
[02:10:16.770 --> 02:10:19.570]  who have sent me love and support and well wishes,
[02:10:19.570 --> 02:10:20.490]  telling me to get better,
[02:10:20.490 --> 02:10:22.290]  telling me to take care of my head.
[02:10:22.290 --> 02:10:24.690]  Several people volunteered to come do chores for me.
[02:10:24.690 --> 02:10:26.090]  So I appreciate that.
[02:10:26.090 --> 02:10:28.210]  You guys have no idea what that means to me.
[02:10:28.210 --> 02:10:29.570]  I'm getting back on my feet.
[02:10:29.570 --> 02:10:30.410]  Well, I've been on my feet,
[02:10:30.410 --> 02:10:33.050]  but I'm getting my head back in there while I'm doing it.
[02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:35.330]  So let's move on to the grow lesson, you guys.
[02:10:35.330 --> 02:10:36.690]  I've written a bunch of stuff
[02:10:36.690 --> 02:10:40.210]  and I'm gonna try to condense it all into one lesson for you.
[02:10:40.210 --> 02:10:41.890]  So I may leave a little bit out.
[02:10:41.890 --> 02:10:43.530]  If you have any questions, just ask
[02:10:44.050 --> 02:10:47.290]  and I'll go back over anything I went too fast on.
[02:10:47.290 --> 02:10:49.170]  All right, I'm gonna take a quick drink and a dab
[02:10:49.170 --> 02:10:51.090]  and we're going to get on with the grow lesson.
[02:10:51.090 --> 02:10:51.930]  Here we go.
[02:10:51.930 --> 02:10:53.010]  Hey guys, while I'm taking a dab,
[02:10:53.010 --> 02:10:54.250]  make sure you support our sponsors,
[02:10:54.250 --> 02:10:55.770]  the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[02:10:55.770 --> 02:10:57.370]  If you need organic soil amendments
[02:10:57.370 --> 02:10:59.010]  or high quality worm castings,
[02:10:59.010 --> 02:11:03.090]  check out www.RockyMountainWormCo.com today.
[02:11:05.970 --> 02:11:07.170]  All right guys, in the last episode,
[02:11:07.170 --> 02:11:08.970]  I talked a lot about vegetative growth
[02:11:08.970 --> 02:11:11.170]  and we got right up to the first day of flowering.
[02:11:11.170 --> 02:11:12.850]  And that's where I wanna start off today.
[02:11:12.890 --> 02:11:14.850]  Let's start a flowering cycle.
[02:11:14.850 --> 02:11:16.170]  But first let's talk a little bit
[02:11:16.170 --> 02:11:17.890]  about the flowering period.
[02:11:17.890 --> 02:11:20.130]  I've alluded that there are three trimesters
[02:11:20.130 --> 02:11:21.210]  to the flowering period.
[02:11:21.210 --> 02:11:23.930]  And let me explain a little what I meant by that.
[02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:28.210]  For this, we're gonna talk about a nine week flowering plan.
[02:11:28.210 --> 02:11:29.850]  We'll use Grateful Dog as an example
[02:11:29.850 --> 02:11:31.450]  because it likes to finish in about nine weeks.
[02:11:31.450 --> 02:11:32.970]  So that's perfect.
[02:11:32.970 --> 02:11:35.130]  The first trimester is what I would refer to
[02:11:35.130 --> 02:11:37.410]  as the transition phase.
[02:11:37.410 --> 02:11:39.490]  The second trimester is full flower
[02:11:39.970 --> 02:11:44.450]  and the third trimester is the finishing and ripening phase.
[02:11:44.450 --> 02:11:45.850]  So I'm gonna try to talk a little bit
[02:11:45.850 --> 02:11:48.610]  about what the plants want during each trimester.
[02:11:48.610 --> 02:11:50.170]  And I'll do my best to kind of break it down
[02:11:50.170 --> 02:11:52.970]  week by week for you and let you know what to feed
[02:11:52.970 --> 02:11:56.370]  and what you can be doing to your plants each week.
[02:11:56.370 --> 02:11:58.370]  We'll find like the main important things
[02:11:58.370 --> 02:11:59.850]  to do to your plants each week.
[02:11:59.850 --> 02:12:01.250]  And then I'll give you some ideas
[02:12:01.250 --> 02:12:02.650]  that'll really improve your crops.
[02:12:02.650 --> 02:12:04.130]  And then in a future episode,
[02:12:04.130 --> 02:12:07.130]  we're gonna focus all about improving your crops.
[02:12:07.130 --> 02:12:09.810]  So let's get on it.
[02:12:09.810 --> 02:12:10.970]  Let's start a flowering cycle.
[02:12:10.970 --> 02:12:13.210]  Today would be day one of week one of flower.
[02:12:13.210 --> 02:12:15.690]  So I would start on a Monday.
[02:12:15.690 --> 02:12:16.610]  That's just my preference.
[02:12:16.610 --> 02:12:17.490]  We've talked about that.
[02:12:17.490 --> 02:12:20.010]  I would go to that Monday and I would say day one of flower,
[02:12:20.010 --> 02:12:21.930]  week one, day one.
[02:12:21.930 --> 02:12:23.490]  Then I would go through and mark that calendar,
[02:12:23.490 --> 02:12:26.170]  week two, week three, week four, week five, week six,
[02:12:26.170 --> 02:12:29.730]  so that it's easily viewable.
[02:12:29.730 --> 02:12:30.570]  All right.
[02:12:30.570 --> 02:12:33.450]  So you wanna set the lights for a 12-12 cycle.
[02:12:33.450 --> 02:12:35.430]  That means we want the lights to be on for 12 hours
[02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:37.630]  and off for 12 hours of uninterrupted darkness
[02:12:37.630 --> 02:12:39.670]  every day and every night.
[02:12:39.670 --> 02:12:41.630]  We can't have any dark during the night cycle.
[02:12:41.630 --> 02:12:44.110]  I can't stress, or any light during the night cycle.
[02:12:44.110 --> 02:12:46.310]  I can't stress how important it is to have total darkness
[02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:48.230]  for the dark period of your bloom cycle.
[02:12:48.230 --> 02:12:51.150]  The room needs to be totally pitch black dark.
[02:12:51.150 --> 02:12:54.110]  If you can see any light in there, it's too much.
[02:12:54.110 --> 02:12:55.670]  If you can stand in the room
[02:12:55.670 --> 02:12:57.470]  and put your hand in front of your face,
[02:12:57.470 --> 02:12:59.130]  if you can see your hand at all,
[02:12:59.130 --> 02:13:01.590]  you need more darkness in there.
[02:13:01.590 --> 02:13:03.750]  That's completely important.
[02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:05.630]  It's also, let's see, where was I?
[02:13:05.630 --> 02:13:08.910]  It's equally important not to interrupt the dark period.
[02:13:08.910 --> 02:13:10.750]  Interrupting the dark period will cause your plants
[02:13:10.750 --> 02:13:13.550]  to possibly herm and possibly make seeds.
[02:13:13.550 --> 02:13:14.870]  Your plants are asleep.
[02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:15.790]  You wanna let them sleep.
[02:13:15.790 --> 02:13:16.630]  It pisses you off.
[02:13:16.630 --> 02:13:17.790]  When I wake you up in the middle of the night,
[02:13:17.790 --> 02:13:19.830]  it'd piss your plants off too.
[02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:21.190]  So running a 12-12 cycle,
[02:13:21.190 --> 02:13:23.170]  I like to keep my metal halide bulbs in
[02:13:23.170 --> 02:13:25.230]  for the first two weeks of flowering.
[02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:28.090]  For the first week of flowering, all right, here we go.
[02:13:28.090 --> 02:13:29.310]  For the first week of flowering,
[02:13:29.310 --> 02:13:32.050]  I would feed my vegetative base nutrients
[02:13:32.050 --> 02:13:35.490]  and I would start pumping up my P and K values, okay?
[02:13:35.490 --> 02:13:36.730]  And I would also keep focusing
[02:13:36.730 --> 02:13:38.410]  on root development a little bit.
[02:13:38.410 --> 02:13:40.330]  If I were using bottled nutrients,
[02:13:40.330 --> 02:13:42.530]  I would use a little bit of liquid karma,
[02:13:42.530 --> 02:13:44.110]  some silica blast.
[02:13:44.110 --> 02:13:46.150]  I would use a little bit of Humboldt honey
[02:13:46.150 --> 02:13:49.570]  and some roots ZHO or something similar,
[02:13:49.570 --> 02:13:50.930]  some kind of similar rooting powder,
[02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:54.010]  or maybe some like, what was I using before?
[02:13:54.010 --> 02:13:55.130]  OGT, that works.
[02:13:55.130 --> 02:13:56.910]  Some great white shark works.
[02:13:56.910 --> 02:13:58.450]  Anything like that would work for you.
[02:13:58.450 --> 02:14:01.090]  And also maybe I would add in some hygrozyme.
[02:14:01.090 --> 02:14:03.170]  Don't expect to see a whole lot of action from the plants
[02:14:03.170 --> 02:14:05.250]  your first week of flower.
[02:14:05.250 --> 02:14:07.290]  This is the start of the transitional period.
[02:14:07.290 --> 02:14:10.710]  Like I said, this is transitional phase from veg to bloom.
[02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:12.570]  And then in about six to 10 days
[02:14:12.570 --> 02:14:15.490]  is where you're really going to see your changes.
[02:14:15.490 --> 02:14:17.450]  So let me add something here while I'm thinking about it.
[02:14:17.450 --> 02:14:20.710]  Your plants are going to get fed nutrients on every Monday,
[02:14:20.710 --> 02:14:23.050]  but they're probably going to get thirsty
[02:14:23.050 --> 02:14:24.810]  and need a drink before the next Monday.
[02:14:24.810 --> 02:14:28.370]  So it's probably going to be Wednesday or Thursday,
[02:14:28.370 --> 02:14:32.290]  but on that day, water your plants with just clean water,
[02:14:32.290 --> 02:14:33.130]  pH did 6.5.
[02:14:34.690 --> 02:14:36.050]  You don't want to feed every day
[02:14:36.050 --> 02:14:37.730]  because then your plants are going to start
[02:14:37.730 --> 02:14:39.330]  to get over fertilized
[02:14:39.330 --> 02:14:43.010]  and they are going to get what we call nutrient lockout.
[02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:45.430]  All of your bottle nutrients are salt-based.
[02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:48.290]  And if we keep feeding these salts to our plants,
[02:14:48.290 --> 02:14:51.010]  they get salty and they don't want to take up more salts.
[02:14:51.010 --> 02:14:53.230]  So they simply stop taking up nutrients
[02:14:53.230 --> 02:14:54.910]  and that's called nutrient lockout.
[02:14:54.910 --> 02:14:56.250]  So we're going to feed clean water
[02:14:56.250 --> 02:14:58.290]  every Wednesday or Thursday.
[02:14:59.010 --> 02:15:00.010]  And prevent that nutrient lockout
[02:15:00.010 --> 02:15:02.650]  by giving these girls a fresh drink.
[02:15:02.650 --> 02:15:06.450]  So that's going to put us into week two.
[02:15:07.390 --> 02:15:10.690]  For week two, I would start feeding my bloom-based nutrients
[02:15:10.690 --> 02:15:12.290]  and I would add some cow mag.
[02:15:12.290 --> 02:15:14.810]  I would add, this is if you're going to use bottle nutrients
[02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:17.290]  and this is what I would use if I were using Liquid Karma.
[02:15:17.290 --> 02:15:18.950]  If you're using a different brand,
[02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:21.170]  all of these products are easily replaceable.
[02:15:21.170 --> 02:15:22.330]  Just look at your feed chart
[02:15:22.330 --> 02:15:25.030]  and look at your other brand and replace the bottles.
[02:15:25.030 --> 02:15:26.650]  It'll be that easy.
[02:15:26.650 --> 02:15:30.170]  So for week two, I would do some cow mag,
[02:15:30.170 --> 02:15:32.170]  some Liquid Karma, Silica Blast,
[02:15:32.170 --> 02:15:34.730]  and I would add a little bit of SeaPlex.
[02:15:34.730 --> 02:15:36.890]  Week two is where you really need to start paying attention
[02:15:36.890 --> 02:15:38.770]  for male plants if you started from seeds.
[02:15:38.770 --> 02:15:41.770]  You're going to start seeing little ball sacks develop.
[02:15:41.770 --> 02:15:44.410]  If you've got males in there, get them out.
[02:15:44.410 --> 02:15:46.170]  In week two, you should start seeing pre-flowers
[02:15:46.170 --> 02:15:47.810]  and the plants are starting to stretch.
[02:15:47.810 --> 02:15:48.630]  By the end of this week,
[02:15:48.630 --> 02:15:51.890]  you should have identified your males and isolated them.
[02:15:51.890 --> 02:15:53.810]  If you don't plan on breeding,
[02:15:53.810 --> 02:15:56.570]  definitely get those males out of there, cut them down.
[02:15:57.370 --> 02:15:58.690]  If you put them in the garage, they may keep going.
[02:15:58.690 --> 02:15:59.530]  If you put them somewhere,
[02:15:59.530 --> 02:16:01.210]  they may keep going and make pollen.
[02:16:01.210 --> 02:16:03.570]  Kill them, cut them down, kill them,
[02:16:03.570 --> 02:16:04.690]  unless you plan on breeding.
[02:16:04.690 --> 02:16:05.570]  And if you plan on breeding,
[02:16:05.570 --> 02:16:07.050]  then I don't need to tell you what to do with males.
[02:16:07.050 --> 02:16:09.010]  You've already got that figured out.
[02:16:09.010 --> 02:16:11.250]  So for week two, they're pretty much just going to grow.
[02:16:11.250 --> 02:16:12.970]  You're going to start seeing flowering,
[02:16:12.970 --> 02:16:14.810]  flower sets start to develop.
[02:16:14.810 --> 02:16:16.730]  You'll start to see the sex.
[02:16:16.730 --> 02:16:17.850]  If you're using feminized seeds,
[02:16:17.850 --> 02:16:19.050]  still pay attention to the sex.
[02:16:19.050 --> 02:16:21.170]  You may get some hermaphrodites.
[02:16:21.170 --> 02:16:22.370]  Some shit could have gone wrong.
[02:16:22.370 --> 02:16:23.610]  You may have gotten the wrong seeds.
[02:16:23.610 --> 02:16:25.390]  You never know. Pay attention.
[02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:28.790]  Don't take that feminized label as the complete,
[02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:30.310]  this will be a perfect female plant.
[02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:32.790]  That could not be the case.
[02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:33.950]  All right.
[02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:35.750]  So week three, week three is a busy week.
[02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:38.390]  This is where we really start getting busy.
[02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:41.270]  You should have identified your males by now.
[02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:43.830]  You should have pulled them.
[02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:45.550]  Hopefully, if you had clones of those,
[02:16:45.550 --> 02:16:47.870]  you tossed the clones of the males also.
[02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:50.310]  So if you don't have nice bud sites developing
[02:16:50.310 --> 02:16:51.350]  by the beginning of week three,
[02:16:51.350 --> 02:16:53.710]  you may have a light leak or another issue
[02:16:53.710 --> 02:16:55.590]  during your dark period.
[02:16:55.590 --> 02:16:57.910]  If you're not starting to see little dandelion
[02:16:57.910 --> 02:17:00.790]  looking bud sites by now, go in the room at night
[02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:02.510]  and make sure you're not getting a light leak.
[02:17:02.510 --> 02:17:04.750]  A small light leak will prevent your plants
[02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:06.390]  from going into flower.
[02:17:06.390 --> 02:17:10.590]  So for week three, I would feed my bloom-based nutrients.
[02:17:10.590 --> 02:17:12.290]  I would feed cow mag.
[02:17:12.290 --> 02:17:13.830]  I would introduce fulvex.
[02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:15.390]  I would use liquid karma.
[02:17:15.390 --> 02:17:16.830]  I would use hydroplex,
[02:17:18.190 --> 02:17:20.430]  c-Plex, silica blast, humble honey,
[02:17:20.430 --> 02:17:22.690]  and hygrozyme this week.
[02:17:22.690 --> 02:17:24.570]  This will be the basic recipe through flowering
[02:17:24.570 --> 02:17:25.570]  minus the hygrozyme.
[02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:28.250]  I only hygrozyme every other feed.
[02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:30.310]  I do add a few other things to my personal mix,
[02:17:30.310 --> 02:17:32.330]  but this will get you guys through flowering.
[02:17:32.330 --> 02:17:33.930]  I don't wanna get too crazy
[02:17:33.930 --> 02:17:35.450]  and have you buying a whole bunch of things
[02:17:35.450 --> 02:17:36.770]  when you're not ready for that.
[02:17:36.770 --> 02:17:39.970]  So I did get this mix from the Botanicare website.
[02:17:39.970 --> 02:17:43.050]  If you need help mixing up a great Botanicare recipe,
[02:17:43.050 --> 02:17:44.410]  just go to the Botanicare website,
[02:17:44.410 --> 02:17:45.910]  go to the nutrient calculator,
[02:17:47.050 --> 02:17:47.970]  basically fill it in.
[02:17:47.970 --> 02:17:49.490]  It asks how many weeks you wanna veg,
[02:17:49.490 --> 02:17:51.130]  how many weeks you wanna flower.
[02:17:51.130 --> 02:17:53.530]  It asks you which bottles of nutrients you've got.
[02:17:53.530 --> 02:17:56.850]  You click on those and it'll tell you what to feed.
[02:17:56.850 --> 02:18:00.250]  I would recommend reducing it just a little bit.
[02:18:00.250 --> 02:18:03.270]  Feed your plants a reduced mix and see how they react.
[02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:04.370]  You can always feed more,
[02:18:04.370 --> 02:18:05.810]  but you can't unfeed your plants
[02:18:05.810 --> 02:18:07.850]  once they've burned themselves.
[02:18:07.850 --> 02:18:09.410]  So don't overdo it.
[02:18:09.410 --> 02:18:11.710]  They do, I like Botanicare, I like the company,
[02:18:11.710 --> 02:18:13.130]  but they are a company.
[02:18:13.130 --> 02:18:14.410]  They need you to buy more.
[02:18:14.410 --> 02:18:16.490]  So they kind of tell you to use a little bit extra
[02:18:16.490 --> 02:18:18.210]  is my opinion.
[02:18:18.210 --> 02:18:20.730]  The more you use, the sooner you gotta buy another bottle.
[02:18:21.370 --> 02:18:24.090]  Anyway, let's talk more about week three.
[02:18:24.090 --> 02:18:25.890]  Yeah, you can go get that on the Botanicare website
[02:18:25.890 --> 02:18:26.730]  is where I left off, right?
[02:18:26.730 --> 02:18:28.250]  All right, if you're using a different brand,
[02:18:28.250 --> 02:18:30.050]  they do have a different feeding chart online
[02:18:30.050 --> 02:18:30.930]  for you to follow.
[02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:34.810]  Almost all the popular brands have a feeding chart right now.
[02:18:34.810 --> 02:18:35.930]  And you can easily, like I said,
[02:18:35.930 --> 02:18:38.170]  you can easily swap out bottle for bottle.
[02:18:38.170 --> 02:18:40.450]  If you know, if you just read, like I said,
[02:18:40.450 --> 02:18:42.990]  Liquid Karma, read the bottle, see what's in there,
[02:18:42.990 --> 02:18:44.570]  look at whatever brand you're using
[02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:47.150]  and there's the equivalent for your brand is there.
[02:18:47.150 --> 02:18:49.130]  It's all basically the same shit.
[02:18:49.130 --> 02:18:52.570]  I just prefer Botanicare if I'm going bottled nudes.
[02:18:52.570 --> 02:18:54.530]  All right, so I also like to add a nice dose
[02:18:54.530 --> 02:18:57.010]  of carbs and sugars at week three.
[02:18:57.010 --> 02:18:58.890]  We're going to start seeing resin production
[02:18:58.890 --> 02:19:01.370]  around week, mid week three, early week four.
[02:19:01.370 --> 02:19:03.850]  You'll very little resin production, but it will start.
[02:19:03.850 --> 02:19:05.470]  And why not give it some carbs and sugars
[02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:06.610]  to start contributing to that?
[02:19:06.610 --> 02:19:07.810]  That's my opinion.
[02:19:07.810 --> 02:19:09.210]  And I also think that carbs and sugars
[02:19:09.210 --> 02:19:11.310]  keep the mycos in your root zone,
[02:19:11.310 --> 02:19:13.290]  living and healthy and happy.
[02:19:13.290 --> 02:19:16.530]  So that is always a good idea to add those guys.
[02:19:16.530 --> 02:19:18.730]  So in week three, we should really see Budsites developing.
[02:19:19.370 --> 02:19:21.730]  This is a good time to start lollipopping your plants.
[02:19:21.730 --> 02:19:24.090]  What that means is kind of cleaning up the bottom
[02:19:24.090 --> 02:19:25.850]  little mini buds and the sucker branches
[02:19:25.850 --> 02:19:28.170]  that aren't going to get enough light to become viable buds.
[02:19:28.170 --> 02:19:30.610]  Just get in there and clean that shit right out.
[02:19:30.610 --> 02:19:31.510]  Don't be afraid.
[02:19:33.090 --> 02:19:34.610]  We'll do a whole lesson on lollipopping
[02:19:34.610 --> 02:19:35.890]  if we haven't already.
[02:19:35.890 --> 02:19:36.930]  You want to get in there.
[02:19:36.930 --> 02:19:38.810]  The light's only going to penetrate your canopy
[02:19:38.810 --> 02:19:41.730]  about 18 to 20, maybe 24 inches.
[02:19:41.730 --> 02:19:43.570]  If you're using regular thousand watt bulbs,
[02:19:43.570 --> 02:19:44.810]  if you're using lower wattage,
[02:19:44.810 --> 02:19:46.850]  you've got even less penetration.
[02:19:46.850 --> 02:19:48.050]  So you're going to want to get in there.
[02:19:48.370 --> 02:19:49.290]  If your plant's three foot tall,
[02:19:49.290 --> 02:19:51.530]  you don't need a whole three foot stock.
[02:19:51.530 --> 02:19:54.250]  You want to kind of clean off the bottom 12 inches or so.
[02:19:54.250 --> 02:19:56.450]  And that gives you more airflow down there.
[02:19:56.450 --> 02:19:57.610]  Those buds that develop down there
[02:19:57.610 --> 02:19:59.370]  are just going to be wispy shit anyway,
[02:19:59.370 --> 02:20:01.130]  unless you're going to make hash with it,
[02:20:01.130 --> 02:20:02.730]  clean that up, send all that energy
[02:20:02.730 --> 02:20:03.690]  up to the top of the plant,
[02:20:03.690 --> 02:20:05.010]  because you don't want to waste time
[02:20:05.010 --> 02:20:07.130]  trimming that bottom shit anyway.
[02:20:07.130 --> 02:20:10.530]  So we're going to lollipop, clean up the bottoms.
[02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:14.210]  Also, I would recommend switching
[02:20:14.210 --> 02:20:16.690]  from metal halide bulbs to high pressure sodium bulbs
[02:20:16.690 --> 02:20:18.130]  at the start of week three.
[02:20:18.130 --> 02:20:22.290]  Week three is the last week of the first trimester,
[02:20:22.290 --> 02:20:24.570]  and it's the last week of the transition
[02:20:24.570 --> 02:20:26.210]  and stretching phase.
[02:20:26.210 --> 02:20:28.930]  So after this week, your plants will quit stretching so much.
[02:20:28.930 --> 02:20:31.050]  Week three is really the super stretch.
[02:20:31.050 --> 02:20:33.090]  And then week four, they'll quit stretching
[02:20:33.090 --> 02:20:35.490]  and start working more on buds for you.
[02:20:35.490 --> 02:20:37.570]  So in week three, you want to lollipop
[02:20:37.570 --> 02:20:39.970]  and you want to change to your high pressure sodium bulbs
[02:20:39.970 --> 02:20:42.250]  are your main goals for week three.
[02:20:42.250 --> 02:20:43.650]  And guys, I know I'm going kind of fast,
[02:20:43.650 --> 02:20:45.410]  but we got nine weeks to cover here,
[02:20:45.410 --> 02:20:47.530]  and I'm only to week four,
[02:20:47.530 --> 02:20:49.090]  and we're 15 minutes in already.
[02:20:49.090 --> 02:20:53.210]  So week four, I'm going to feed a very similar mix
[02:20:53.210 --> 02:20:55.330]  that I would in week three.
[02:20:55.330 --> 02:20:57.130]  Week four is the end of the stretch phase
[02:20:57.130 --> 02:20:59.650]  and the start of actual bud growth.
[02:20:59.650 --> 02:21:01.810]  You'll really start to see buds developing by now.
[02:21:01.810 --> 02:21:03.170]  And if you don't, you've got a problem.
[02:21:03.170 --> 02:21:05.290]  We need to get in there and make sure you've got darkness,
[02:21:05.290 --> 02:21:07.770]  make sure you don't have some shitty plants.
[02:21:07.770 --> 02:21:11.130]  So week four is another week to lollipop.
[02:21:11.130 --> 02:21:12.090]  You can definitely get in there
[02:21:12.090 --> 02:21:13.490]  and lollipop a little bit more.
[02:21:13.490 --> 02:21:14.530]  I just use my thumbnail.
[02:21:14.530 --> 02:21:16.250]  I don't trim my thumbnail all the way down.
[02:21:16.250 --> 02:21:19.650]  I just use that to pick off those little sucker buds,
[02:21:19.650 --> 02:21:21.210]  collect them up, put them in a little trash can
[02:21:21.210 --> 02:21:22.050]  and toss them.
[02:21:22.050 --> 02:21:23.530]  Those are, or put them in the compost pile
[02:21:23.530 --> 02:21:24.490]  if you're doing that.
[02:21:24.490 --> 02:21:25.810]  Those little sucker buds are just that,
[02:21:25.810 --> 02:21:26.930]  they're just little suckers.
[02:21:26.930 --> 02:21:29.530]  All that energy could go up to the top of the plant.
[02:21:29.530 --> 02:21:30.970]  If you guys are growing for just hash,
[02:21:30.970 --> 02:21:33.250]  you could do whatever you want with that, I get it.
[02:21:33.250 --> 02:21:36.210]  So now it's also a good time to start adding stakes
[02:21:36.210 --> 02:21:38.610]  or some sort of supports to the branches,
[02:21:38.610 --> 02:21:40.490]  because we're going to get some hefty buds.
[02:21:40.490 --> 02:21:42.290]  And once we get into week five and six,
[02:21:42.290 --> 02:21:45.210]  we're really going to need stakes to support everything.
[02:21:45.210 --> 02:21:46.490]  But by week five and six,
[02:21:46.490 --> 02:21:48.650]  it's such a bitch to maneuver those plants.
[02:21:48.650 --> 02:21:50.970]  Your branches got long, sticky colas on there
[02:21:50.970 --> 02:21:52.650]  and you don't want to be playing with the resin
[02:21:52.650 --> 02:21:54.570]  and getting the resin all over your clothes.
[02:21:54.570 --> 02:21:55.690]  You want to leave that on the plant.
[02:21:55.690 --> 02:21:57.810]  So get in there about week four.
[02:21:57.810 --> 02:22:01.770]  And I like to put a stake to support the middle cola,
[02:22:01.770 --> 02:22:04.610]  because I know I'm going to have a big, huge fat cola.
[02:22:04.610 --> 02:22:05.930]  And then I like to put about four,
[02:22:05.930 --> 02:22:08.770]  maybe six sticks around the pot,
[02:22:08.770 --> 02:22:10.290]  because I'm going to get some big colas.
[02:22:10.290 --> 02:22:13.250]  And I use those sticks to strap up my major colas,
[02:22:13.250 --> 02:22:15.130]  just right to the stick.
[02:22:15.130 --> 02:22:17.050]  And I do it early, because like I'm saying,
[02:22:17.050 --> 02:22:18.010]  in week five and six,
[02:22:18.010 --> 02:22:19.370]  I'm going to have some buds going on
[02:22:19.370 --> 02:22:21.210]  that I don't want to have to mess with so much.
[02:22:21.210 --> 02:22:23.210]  And if I got them all strapped up already,
[02:22:23.210 --> 02:22:25.010]  I don't have to worry about it.
[02:22:25.010 --> 02:22:26.210]  When I'm working with soil plants,
[02:22:26.210 --> 02:22:29.890]  I usually don't use a trellis or a screen or anything,
[02:22:29.890 --> 02:22:33.370]  but at the dispensary where I'm running the big grow,
[02:22:33.370 --> 02:22:35.490]  we're definitely using a trellis.
[02:22:35.490 --> 02:22:37.050]  And if you're going to trellis the plants,
[02:22:37.050 --> 02:22:39.890]  you need to get that in there during your veg cycle.
[02:22:40.530 --> 02:22:41.850]  That's why when I was doing the veg lesson,
[02:22:41.850 --> 02:22:43.930]  I mentioned that this is the week to do
[02:22:43.930 --> 02:22:46.010]  any type of trellising and shit like that.
[02:22:46.010 --> 02:22:47.650]  That'll have to happen in veg, you guys,
[02:22:47.650 --> 02:22:50.370]  because those plants are going to grow up into that trellis
[02:22:50.370 --> 02:22:52.170]  and you don't want to be bending them and folding them
[02:22:52.170 --> 02:22:53.970]  and manipulating them in flower.
[02:22:53.970 --> 02:22:55.410]  So you have to be prepared for that.
[02:22:55.410 --> 02:22:56.810]  That's why we're making a schedule now
[02:22:56.810 --> 02:22:58.330]  before we put these plants in the dirt
[02:22:58.330 --> 02:23:00.650]  or in the rockwool cubes.
[02:23:00.650 --> 02:23:02.450]  So get your stakes up, you guys.
[02:23:02.450 --> 02:23:05.130]  Water healthy, get your stakes up, more lollipopping.
[02:23:05.130 --> 02:23:06.490]  That's what you're doing for week four.
[02:23:06.490 --> 02:23:08.690]  Let's transition into week five now.
[02:23:08.690 --> 02:23:10.650]  This is when the fun starts, you guys.
[02:23:10.650 --> 02:23:12.490]  The plants start getting photogenic.
[02:23:12.490 --> 02:23:14.610]  The buds start getting chunky.
[02:23:14.610 --> 02:23:15.750]  Since we're getting chunky buds,
[02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:17.910]  it's a good time to stop foliar feeding.
[02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:19.690]  I don't talk a lot about foliar feeding.
[02:23:19.690 --> 02:23:21.610]  I will in the future.
[02:23:21.610 --> 02:23:23.450]  Foliar feeding can lead to a lot of problems
[02:23:23.450 --> 02:23:26.010]  if it's done incorrectly or at the wrong time.
[02:23:26.010 --> 02:23:27.330]  So I haven't introduced that yet.
[02:23:27.330 --> 02:23:29.090]  But if you have gone on your own
[02:23:29.090 --> 02:23:30.090]  and started foliar feeding,
[02:23:30.090 --> 02:23:32.690]  week five is when I would recommend you quit.
[02:23:34.650 --> 02:23:35.850]  It's also important to pay attention
[02:23:35.850 --> 02:23:37.610]  to your humidity in week five.
[02:23:37.610 --> 02:23:40.010]  High humidity and big buds can be a great way
[02:23:40.010 --> 02:23:43.650]  to create powdery mildew or other mold-related problems.
[02:23:43.650 --> 02:23:45.290]  I'm sure you guys that listen to the podcast
[02:23:45.290 --> 02:23:47.850]  have heard me talk about growing in a new room.
[02:23:47.850 --> 02:23:49.130]  I was in a basement.
[02:23:49.130 --> 02:23:54.130]  I had a exterior wall corner that got really cold.
[02:23:54.170 --> 02:23:57.130]  And that corner pocket right there had a lot of cold air.
[02:23:57.130 --> 02:24:00.370]  And I had a five ounce white rhino plant that I cut down
[02:24:00.370 --> 02:24:02.530]  and discovered powdery mildew on one bud of it
[02:24:02.530 --> 02:24:03.930]  as I was cutting it down.
[02:24:03.930 --> 02:24:06.450]  And I threw the entire plant away
[02:24:06.770 --> 02:24:09.410]  about probably five ounces worth of good cannabis,
[02:24:09.410 --> 02:24:10.850]  somewhere between four and six ounces
[02:24:10.850 --> 02:24:12.450]  is what those plants were averaging.
[02:24:12.450 --> 02:24:16.090]  So those five ounces that my patients did not get to enjoy
[02:24:16.090 --> 02:24:18.530]  because I let it get powdery mildew.
[02:24:18.530 --> 02:24:19.810]  So pay attention to the room.
[02:24:19.810 --> 02:24:21.650]  Don't let your room get too humid.
[02:24:21.650 --> 02:24:22.850]  My problem was that it was cold
[02:24:22.850 --> 02:24:25.610]  and I was letting cold air mix with the warm air
[02:24:25.610 --> 02:24:28.170]  and that created mildew in my room.
[02:24:28.170 --> 02:24:29.010]  But I learned from it.
[02:24:29.010 --> 02:24:29.850]  I learned a whole lot.
[02:24:29.850 --> 02:24:32.290]  That shit will never happen to me again.
[02:24:32.290 --> 02:24:34.490]  And guys, if it happens to you, don't feel bad.
[02:24:34.490 --> 02:24:35.370]  Shit's gonna happen.
[02:24:35.370 --> 02:24:36.370]  You just have to learn from it.
[02:24:37.210 --> 02:24:39.090]  It's how you deal with it is what makes you the grower.
[02:24:39.090 --> 02:24:41.970]  So do your best to get the humidity under control.
[02:24:41.970 --> 02:24:43.370]  You don't want too much humidity in there.
[02:24:43.370 --> 02:24:45.410]  You do not wanna start getting mildew.
[02:24:46.290 --> 02:24:48.530]  For week five, I would recommend getting your humidity
[02:24:48.530 --> 02:24:49.770]  right around 50%.
[02:24:49.770 --> 02:24:53.330]  If you can get it to 40, there's nothing wrong with that.
[02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:54.210]  You don't want it too high.
[02:24:54.210 --> 02:24:55.330]  That's when you're gonna get problems.
[02:24:55.330 --> 02:24:56.690]  Too low of humidity,
[02:24:56.690 --> 02:24:58.250]  your room's gonna dry up kind of quickly
[02:24:58.250 --> 02:25:01.410]  and the buds don't get as sticky, I don't think.
[02:25:01.410 --> 02:25:04.170]  But if you have the option, or if you're stuck with one,
[02:25:04.170 --> 02:25:05.290]  if you have to go too high or too low,
[02:25:05.290 --> 02:25:07.770]  definitely go too low of humidity.
[02:25:07.770 --> 02:25:08.610]  So let's see.
[02:25:08.610 --> 02:25:09.930]  We talked about getting rid of the humidity.
[02:25:09.930 --> 02:25:12.090]  I'm reading notes as I do this.
[02:25:12.090 --> 02:25:13.970]  Oh, this is where I would stop lollipopping, you guys.
[02:25:13.970 --> 02:25:16.530]  Week five, don't lollipop anymore.
[02:25:16.530 --> 02:25:17.370]  You can if you want to,
[02:25:17.370 --> 02:25:19.290]  but you should have gotten all that taken care of by now
[02:25:19.290 --> 02:25:20.610]  and you're just gonna kind of shock the plant
[02:25:20.610 --> 02:25:22.370]  if you keep doing it.
[02:25:22.370 --> 02:25:24.330]  You may, if you keep lollipopping
[02:25:24.330 --> 02:25:25.610]  and fucking with the plant this far in,
[02:25:25.610 --> 02:25:27.410]  you may cause it to stress out and harm.
[02:25:27.410 --> 02:25:30.610]  Just depends on what other stress you're giving to the plant.
[02:25:30.610 --> 02:25:35.090]  So you should have a room full of sexy, chunky buds by now.
[02:25:35.930 --> 02:25:37.010]  They're gonna start falling over and needing attention.
[02:25:37.010 --> 02:25:40.650]  So hopefully you've got plenty of sticks in there.
[02:25:40.650 --> 02:25:43.090]  You're in there paying attention every day.
[02:25:43.090 --> 02:25:44.010]  You're gonna go in there one day
[02:25:44.010 --> 02:25:45.610]  and you're gonna find a bud that you didn't notice
[02:25:45.610 --> 02:25:47.090]  and it's gonna be straight sideways
[02:25:47.090 --> 02:25:48.890]  looking like it's ready to break.
[02:25:48.890 --> 02:25:49.810]  Don't panic.
[02:25:49.810 --> 02:25:50.970]  Just get in there and support it.
[02:25:50.970 --> 02:25:52.650]  Give it some support.
[02:25:52.650 --> 02:25:54.570]  That shit's gonna happen to you.
[02:25:54.570 --> 02:25:55.810]  And you're gonna learn all these things
[02:25:55.810 --> 02:25:57.690]  over a couple of grows of what to look for
[02:25:57.690 --> 02:26:00.090]  and you'll learn to stop panicking.
[02:26:00.090 --> 02:26:01.730]  When you see a problem, guys, don't panic.
[02:26:01.730 --> 02:26:04.210]  I know I keep saying that, but if you freak out,
[02:26:04.210 --> 02:26:05.490]  you're just gonna make it worse.
[02:26:05.490 --> 02:26:06.890]  When you see a problem in the grow room,
[02:26:06.890 --> 02:26:08.250]  just take a minute.
[02:26:08.250 --> 02:26:09.090]  It's a plant.
[02:26:09.090 --> 02:26:10.130]  We can fix it, hopefully.
[02:26:10.130 --> 02:26:12.610]  If not, we'll just make BHO out of it.
[02:26:12.610 --> 02:26:14.530]  You're gonna be okay.
[02:26:14.530 --> 02:26:15.370]  So for week five,
[02:26:15.370 --> 02:26:17.810]  I like to add a really strong dose of sugars and carbs.
[02:26:17.810 --> 02:26:20.970]  One of my favorite bottled products is Humboldt honey.
[02:26:20.970 --> 02:26:22.450]  I use that at week three,
[02:26:22.450 --> 02:26:25.970]  but I use a nice fat dose of it again at week five.
[02:26:25.970 --> 02:26:27.370]  So for week five,
[02:26:27.370 --> 02:26:29.850]  you want to make sure you've got your supports in place.
[02:26:29.850 --> 02:26:31.090]  If you haven't done it in week four,
[02:26:31.090 --> 02:26:34.530]  you may need to add a few more sticks in place for week five
[02:26:34.530 --> 02:26:36.130]  to get those bigger buds up in place.
[02:26:36.130 --> 02:26:38.250]  What I do, I put a,
[02:26:38.250 --> 02:26:40.130]  I think it's a six foot tall bamboo stick,
[02:26:40.130 --> 02:26:41.450]  because I grow big plants, you guys.
[02:26:41.450 --> 02:26:43.570]  I put a six foot tall bamboo stick
[02:26:43.570 --> 02:26:44.730]  toward the outer edge of the plant
[02:26:44.730 --> 02:26:47.210]  because I don't want to disrupt too much of the root.
[02:26:47.210 --> 02:26:48.850]  I just shove it right into there.
[02:26:50.210 --> 02:26:52.930]  Then I grab the bud that needs some support.
[02:26:52.930 --> 02:26:55.090]  And I use, I've used several different things,
[02:26:55.090 --> 02:26:58.410]  but right now I'm using, they call them fuzzy sticks.
[02:26:58.410 --> 02:26:59.650]  I got them at Hobby Lobby.
[02:26:59.650 --> 02:27:00.810]  They had a whole bunch for really cheap.
[02:27:01.490 --> 02:27:02.370]  So I bought a shit ton of them.
[02:27:02.370 --> 02:27:05.530]  It's kind of like a, it's a pipe cleaner, essentially.
[02:27:05.530 --> 02:27:08.170]  It's like a really long bread tie that you can handle better.
[02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:11.410]  So I just take that and I wrap that right around the stock
[02:27:11.410 --> 02:27:13.210]  of the bud that's going to fall over.
[02:27:13.210 --> 02:27:15.010]  And maybe, maybe I'll do part of the bud.
[02:27:15.010 --> 02:27:16.370]  Just depends on how heavy the bud is,
[02:27:16.370 --> 02:27:18.010]  if I feel like it'll break the stick.
[02:27:18.010 --> 02:27:19.650]  But then I take that and just wrap it around the bud
[02:27:19.650 --> 02:27:22.490]  or the stock and wrap that around the stick itself
[02:27:22.490 --> 02:27:23.890]  so that it's just strapped right up to it.
[02:27:23.890 --> 02:27:25.290]  Like you got a broken finger,
[02:27:25.290 --> 02:27:27.370]  just give that sucker some support.
[02:27:27.370 --> 02:27:29.010]  You just don't want it falling over and breaking.
[02:27:29.010 --> 02:27:30.890]  That's basically your whole goal.
[02:27:30.890 --> 02:27:32.650]  Maybe if you tip it a little bit, if it's at an angle,
[02:27:32.650 --> 02:27:34.650]  it's a good idea because then you can expose more
[02:27:34.650 --> 02:27:37.290]  of that bud to the light instead of just having it
[02:27:37.290 --> 02:27:38.590]  completely up and down.
[02:27:38.590 --> 02:27:40.450]  If you tip it, you get a little more surface area
[02:27:40.450 --> 02:27:44.450]  for that light to hit, which will increase your harvests.
[02:27:44.450 --> 02:27:47.170]  So week five, you want to work on your supports.
[02:27:47.170 --> 02:27:49.210]  You want to feed some sugars and carbs.
[02:27:49.210 --> 02:27:50.890]  You want to monitor your humidity,
[02:27:50.890 --> 02:27:53.570]  get it around 50 to 40% and keep it there
[02:27:53.570 --> 02:27:56.130]  because you're going to start getting chunkier buds
[02:27:56.130 --> 02:27:57.570]  and you don't need mildew.
[02:27:57.570 --> 02:27:59.810]  And you're going to stop foliar feeding.
[02:27:59.810 --> 02:28:01.130]  So that's what's going to happen in week five.
[02:28:01.130 --> 02:28:04.190]  That's going to move us into week six.
[02:28:04.190 --> 02:28:06.350]  In week six, I would feed a very similar recipe
[02:28:06.350 --> 02:28:07.370]  as I did in week five.
[02:28:07.370 --> 02:28:09.250]  I'd use high amounts of P and K
[02:28:09.250 --> 02:28:11.490]  and lots of sugars and carbs.
[02:28:11.490 --> 02:28:13.010]  I would reduce my base nutrients
[02:28:13.010 --> 02:28:15.990]  and focus on resin production and healthy plants.
[02:28:16.970 --> 02:28:19.170]  Week six will be our last full feeding.
[02:28:19.170 --> 02:28:21.530]  Our bud should be chunky and the resin should be starting
[02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:24.130]  to cover the buds and the small leaves.
[02:28:24.130 --> 02:28:26.010]  If you're growing a strain that purples up,
[02:28:26.050 --> 02:28:28.210]  now's a good time to lower the temps a few degrees
[02:28:28.210 --> 02:28:30.250]  during the night cycles.
[02:28:30.250 --> 02:28:32.770]  I try to keep my grow rooms about 77
[02:28:32.770 --> 02:28:35.950]  or 74 to 77 degrees during the light period.
[02:28:35.950 --> 02:28:36.870]  During the dark period,
[02:28:36.870 --> 02:28:40.610]  I try to get it down to about 68, 69 degrees.
[02:28:40.610 --> 02:28:42.010]  At this point in week six,
[02:28:42.010 --> 02:28:44.050]  if I'm working with something that will purple up
[02:28:44.050 --> 02:28:46.930]  a little bit, like the Kalonji Kush or the Flow
[02:28:46.930 --> 02:28:49.410]  or the Ghost OG or the Grateful Dog,
[02:28:49.410 --> 02:28:51.730]  I would drop the temps down just a few more
[02:28:51.730 --> 02:28:54.210]  to like 65 degrees, maybe 67.
[02:28:54.210 --> 02:28:56.530]  And if you get to that 65 at night,
[02:28:56.530 --> 02:28:57.890]  you'll see it in a night or two,
[02:28:57.890 --> 02:28:59.490]  those plants will start to purple up.
[02:28:59.490 --> 02:29:01.330]  The leaves will turn purple for you.
[02:29:02.470 --> 02:29:05.750]  Higher CBD plants, I think like more cold,
[02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:08.170]  but that's just my experience with the Tora Bora
[02:29:08.170 --> 02:29:09.770]  and the Night Nurse.
[02:29:09.770 --> 02:29:12.010]  You may have a totally different plant,
[02:29:12.010 --> 02:29:14.290]  so don't take that as a rule.
[02:29:14.290 --> 02:29:16.290]  That's just my experience.
[02:29:16.290 --> 02:29:18.790]  So you might wanna lower the temps just a little bit
[02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:20.530]  if you're trying to pull out the purples.
[02:29:20.530 --> 02:29:22.850]  If you have more sativa dominant plants,
[02:29:23.770 --> 02:29:25.970]  this would probably piss off the Capelton.
[02:29:25.970 --> 02:29:27.690]  The White Widow would not like it.
[02:29:27.690 --> 02:29:29.250]  Lemon Jeffrey would not like that.
[02:29:29.250 --> 02:29:30.890]  Don't put those in the cold.
[02:29:30.890 --> 02:29:34.050]  But kushy plants, indica dominant plants,
[02:29:34.050 --> 02:29:35.010]  give them a little bit of cold
[02:29:35.010 --> 02:29:37.470]  and they'll purple up for you about week six.
[02:29:38.610 --> 02:29:39.970]  You're gonna have to use more air conditioning,
[02:29:39.970 --> 02:29:41.850]  so that may cost you a little bit,
[02:29:41.850 --> 02:29:44.650]  but I think it's worth it for the plant that enjoys that.
[02:29:44.650 --> 02:29:46.710]  So week seven's a great week for photography, you guys.
[02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:48.130]  You got big, chunky buds.
[02:29:48.130 --> 02:29:49.850]  This is however your last feeding.
[02:29:49.850 --> 02:29:52.690]  So whatever your plants are lacking
[02:29:53.530 --> 02:29:54.930]  or whatever you haven't gotten in there,
[02:29:54.930 --> 02:29:57.090]  this is probably your last chance to do it.
[02:29:57.090 --> 02:29:58.770]  We are going to feed on week seven,
[02:29:58.770 --> 02:30:00.890]  but we're not going to feed the entire program.
[02:30:00.890 --> 02:30:02.330]  We're just gonna give a little bit of stuff
[02:30:02.330 --> 02:30:05.110]  to keep it alive and happy and healthy.
[02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:09.570]  So week six, basically work on a good feeding.
[02:30:09.570 --> 02:30:11.390]  Lower your temps if you want.
[02:30:11.390 --> 02:30:13.450]  Make sure you've got everything supported and staked up.
[02:30:13.450 --> 02:30:14.890]  Make sure nothing falls over.
[02:30:14.890 --> 02:30:16.530]  Keep going through every single week, you guys,
[02:30:16.530 --> 02:30:19.810]  and check for herms, check for males, check for issues.
[02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:20.970]  I should say this also.
[02:30:20.970 --> 02:30:23.210]  Every day, if you can do it every day,
[02:30:23.210 --> 02:30:26.010]  go in your garden and grab each plant
[02:30:26.010 --> 02:30:28.010]  and just grab one leaf and flip it upside down
[02:30:28.010 --> 02:30:29.570]  and inspect the shit out of it.
[02:30:29.570 --> 02:30:32.490]  If you see any signs of bugs, any kinds of pests,
[02:30:32.490 --> 02:30:34.250]  that's when we need to get in there
[02:30:34.250 --> 02:30:35.170]  and really deal with it.
[02:30:35.170 --> 02:30:36.570]  Hopefully you're not too far into flower
[02:30:36.570 --> 02:30:38.690]  by the time we discover a pest.
[02:30:38.690 --> 02:30:40.370]  If you're in flower when we discover pests,
[02:30:40.370 --> 02:30:41.650]  that's a whole nother conversation.
[02:30:41.650 --> 02:30:43.190]  That's when you have to decide,
[02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:46.250]  are these pests going to ruin my garden before harvest time,
[02:30:46.250 --> 02:30:48.370]  or can I eradicate these pests somehow?
[02:30:48.370 --> 02:30:51.210]  There are a lot of decisions to make in that scramble mode.
[02:30:51.210 --> 02:30:52.450]  I'll talk about that in another episode.
[02:30:52.450 --> 02:30:56.770]  I do have a whole pest management episode in the works.
[02:30:56.770 --> 02:30:59.730]  So week six, we have lower the temps.
[02:30:59.730 --> 02:31:00.970]  That's our last big feeding.
[02:31:00.970 --> 02:31:01.810]  We got chunky buds.
[02:31:01.810 --> 02:31:03.410]  Hopefully you took a lot of pictures in week six
[02:31:03.410 --> 02:31:05.690]  because week six is photogenic.
[02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:08.130]  Week seven, this is when we start
[02:31:08.130 --> 02:31:09.990]  what I've been calling the third trimester.
[02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:12.290]  This is ripening and the flush phase.
[02:31:13.170 --> 02:31:15.330]  We won't feed most of our nutrients this week.
[02:31:15.370 --> 02:31:19.850]  I would only use the humble honey for the yucca extract
[02:31:19.850 --> 02:31:21.450]  and the sweetener in there.
[02:31:21.450 --> 02:31:22.890]  That's really going to make your plants sweet.
[02:31:22.890 --> 02:31:24.250]  It's going to make them dense up
[02:31:24.250 --> 02:31:25.890]  and it's going to make them taste good.
[02:31:25.890 --> 02:31:27.490]  And it's going to make them stinky.
[02:31:27.490 --> 02:31:30.030]  I would also use sea plex.
[02:31:30.030 --> 02:31:32.690]  I think sea plex really contributes to the aroma
[02:31:32.690 --> 02:31:35.290]  and flavor of a cush dominant plant.
[02:31:35.290 --> 02:31:36.970]  A lot of sea plex in your cushy plants
[02:31:36.970 --> 02:31:39.770]  will bring out that funk, that feedy smell.
[02:31:39.770 --> 02:31:40.610]  I really love it.
[02:31:40.610 --> 02:31:44.010]  A grateful dog loves sea plex.
[02:31:44.010 --> 02:31:46.770]  If you're growing grateful dog, when you crack it open,
[02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:49.610]  there is an offensive odor that comes out of it.
[02:31:49.610 --> 02:31:52.050]  It's almost foot-like, it's almost armpit-like
[02:31:52.050 --> 02:31:54.170]  and it has a scent of fuel to it.
[02:31:54.170 --> 02:31:56.530]  I think if you pump up the sea plex
[02:31:56.530 --> 02:31:59.690]  or a sea kelp based product, when you grow grateful dog,
[02:31:59.690 --> 02:32:02.370]  it will definitely increase that funky ass terpene
[02:32:02.370 --> 02:32:03.930]  you're getting out of it.
[02:32:03.930 --> 02:32:07.730]  So we're using humble honey, sea plex, hydrazine also.
[02:32:07.730 --> 02:32:11.130]  I like enzymes at this phase to start breaking down
[02:32:11.130 --> 02:32:14.010]  dead material, dead roots that have maybe died
[02:32:14.010 --> 02:32:15.770]  and need to be decomposed in there.
[02:32:15.770 --> 02:32:17.490]  The hydrazine will help eliminate that shit
[02:32:17.490 --> 02:32:19.690]  and speed things along for the flush phase.
[02:32:19.690 --> 02:32:22.290]  Also add some fulvex if you want to speed things up.
[02:32:22.290 --> 02:32:25.530]  And our friend Sean taught us that you can use OGT
[02:32:25.530 --> 02:32:28.210]  to speed up the flushing phase of your plants
[02:32:28.210 --> 02:32:30.970]  because the rock phosphates make the plant
[02:32:30.970 --> 02:32:31.970]  cycle too quickly.
[02:32:31.970 --> 02:32:33.890]  It speeds up the nutritive cycle.
[02:32:33.890 --> 02:32:35.890]  So that will kind of assist us in the flush phase
[02:32:35.890 --> 02:32:36.930]  if we'd like to.
[02:32:36.930 --> 02:32:40.010]  I do not use any of that shit like final phase
[02:32:40.050 --> 02:32:41.530]  or a clear X or any of that.
[02:32:42.450 --> 02:32:45.330]  I feel like that stuff leaves a little bit of a flavor
[02:32:45.330 --> 02:32:46.170]  in the plant.
[02:32:46.170 --> 02:32:48.090]  And I also believe that if we are growing properly
[02:32:48.090 --> 02:32:51.050]  and we're flushing properly, we don't need that product.
[02:32:51.050 --> 02:32:53.210]  That's just another product to sell.
[02:32:53.210 --> 02:32:54.770]  There is a science behind it.
[02:32:54.770 --> 02:32:57.650]  Like I said earlier, we are filling the plant with salts
[02:32:57.650 --> 02:33:00.410]  and those flushing agents are basically sugars
[02:33:00.410 --> 02:33:02.570]  and complex sugars break down salts,
[02:33:02.570 --> 02:33:04.570]  which would break the bond of the salts
[02:33:04.570 --> 02:33:09.570]  around the root base, which would allow cleaner absorption
[02:33:09.690 --> 02:33:11.290]  of the roots and everything would just taste better
[02:33:11.290 --> 02:33:12.370]  and it would flow better.
[02:33:12.370 --> 02:33:13.970]  But I don't think that they're necessary
[02:33:13.970 --> 02:33:16.850]  unless you fucked up at some point in the grow.
[02:33:16.850 --> 02:33:19.330]  So we're very close to harvest time.
[02:33:19.330 --> 02:33:21.730]  We really need to start getting the excess nutrients
[02:33:21.730 --> 02:33:25.370]  out of our buds before we cut them down and prepare them.
[02:33:25.370 --> 02:33:27.890]  So we need to start getting the nitrogen, the phosphorus,
[02:33:27.890 --> 02:33:32.610]  the potassium, the manganese, the calcium, the magnesium,
[02:33:32.610 --> 02:33:34.610]  all the shit that we've been shoving into these plants.
[02:33:34.610 --> 02:33:36.530]  We want to get it out of there now.
[02:33:36.530 --> 02:33:41.410]  So that moves us into week eight.
[02:33:41.410 --> 02:33:42.250]  Excuse me.
[02:33:42.250 --> 02:33:43.090]  Week eight is the beginning,
[02:33:43.090 --> 02:33:45.490]  the official beginning of the flush phase.
[02:33:45.490 --> 02:33:48.730]  What I like to do, and this kind of depends on your setup.
[02:33:48.730 --> 02:33:50.130]  If you have smaller pots,
[02:33:50.130 --> 02:33:52.690]  you can move the pots to the bathroom or the shower,
[02:33:52.690 --> 02:33:54.930]  throw a cinder block, put something down
[02:33:54.930 --> 02:33:57.130]  so you don't scratch up the bathtub or the shower, you guys.
[02:33:57.130 --> 02:33:59.570]  Put a towel down, throw a cinder block or a bucket
[02:33:59.570 --> 02:34:02.090]  right in the bathtub or the shower.
[02:34:02.090 --> 02:34:03.810]  And then if you're using a three gallon pot,
[02:34:03.810 --> 02:34:06.130]  I like to run about nine or 10 gallons of water
[02:34:06.130 --> 02:34:07.650]  right through that pot.
[02:34:07.650 --> 02:34:10.610]  I know that sounds excessive, but what you're doing,
[02:34:10.610 --> 02:34:12.690]  you want to wash, you're washing the dirt.
[02:34:12.690 --> 02:34:14.090]  You want to get all of the nutrients
[02:34:14.090 --> 02:34:15.490]  that we've poured into this plant
[02:34:15.490 --> 02:34:17.250]  through the past seven weeks.
[02:34:17.250 --> 02:34:19.770]  We need to rinse all that shit out of the dirt now.
[02:34:19.770 --> 02:34:21.410]  So, and it's also in the plant.
[02:34:21.410 --> 02:34:22.450]  The plant has been eating it.
[02:34:22.450 --> 02:34:24.330]  So we have to kind of starve the plant
[02:34:24.330 --> 02:34:25.490]  for the next two weeks.
[02:34:26.490 --> 02:34:28.370]  If you're using bigger pots,
[02:34:28.370 --> 02:34:30.370]  it might not be feasible or rational
[02:34:30.370 --> 02:34:32.290]  to drag them to another room.
[02:34:32.290 --> 02:34:33.130]  That's fine.
[02:34:33.130 --> 02:34:34.210]  In a seven gallon pot,
[02:34:34.210 --> 02:34:36.570]  I usually pour about a gallon and a half of water through it
[02:34:36.570 --> 02:34:38.730]  and just let it fill up in that little tray.
[02:34:38.730 --> 02:34:40.970]  And then I'll use a shop vac, a wet dry vac
[02:34:40.970 --> 02:34:43.610]  to go suck the water out of the trays.
[02:34:43.610 --> 02:34:44.690]  I know that sounds excessive,
[02:34:44.690 --> 02:34:46.650]  but I really like to clean out the plants.
[02:34:46.650 --> 02:34:48.810]  If this method doesn't work for you,
[02:34:48.810 --> 02:34:52.090]  well, you have to really focus on when you're flushing.
[02:34:52.090 --> 02:34:54.330]  You want water to come out of the bottom of the pot.
[02:34:54.330 --> 02:34:57.010]  You need, like if I would like to say
[02:34:57.010 --> 02:34:58.530]  at least 10% of the water,
[02:34:58.530 --> 02:35:00.370]  I want to see that come back out of the bottom.
[02:35:00.370 --> 02:35:03.090]  That's how I know I'm actually flushing that plant
[02:35:03.090 --> 02:35:04.050]  and pushing something out.
[02:35:04.890 --> 02:35:05.730]  If nothing's coming out of the bottom,
[02:35:05.730 --> 02:35:06.610]  nothing's coming out.
[02:35:06.610 --> 02:35:08.170]  You got to get water to flow
[02:35:08.170 --> 02:35:09.770]  to get all those nutrients out.
[02:35:09.770 --> 02:35:11.810]  And you're going to want to do that
[02:35:11.810 --> 02:35:13.250]  without drowning your plant.
[02:35:13.250 --> 02:35:14.570]  You're going to want to flush it,
[02:35:14.570 --> 02:35:15.930]  let it kind of dry,
[02:35:15.930 --> 02:35:18.730]  and then flush it again as many times as we can
[02:35:18.730 --> 02:35:20.570]  until the end of week nine.
[02:35:20.570 --> 02:35:23.130]  So the week eight is the start of flushing.
[02:35:23.130 --> 02:35:25.490]  You're probably going to water the shit out of it on Monday.
[02:35:25.490 --> 02:35:27.130]  It's not going to be ready for water again
[02:35:27.130 --> 02:35:29.010]  until probably Thursday or Friday
[02:35:29.010 --> 02:35:30.730]  because you watered it so heavily.
[02:35:31.170 --> 02:35:34.530]  Don't be in too much of a rush to water it again
[02:35:34.530 --> 02:35:36.170]  because you will drown the damn plant.
[02:35:36.170 --> 02:35:38.370]  So Thursday or Friday when you water it again,
[02:35:38.370 --> 02:35:39.410]  do the same thing.
[02:35:39.410 --> 02:35:41.490]  Lots of water, just lots of water.
[02:35:41.490 --> 02:35:42.930]  Just let it go right on through.
[02:35:42.930 --> 02:35:44.250]  Just let it drain right on through.
[02:35:44.250 --> 02:35:47.170]  If you've got like a floor drain or something,
[02:35:47.170 --> 02:35:48.450]  just keep pouring water through.
[02:35:48.450 --> 02:35:50.330]  You can't over flush in my opinion.
[02:35:50.330 --> 02:35:55.130]  It's ideal to use three times the volume of the pot.
[02:35:55.130 --> 02:35:58.410]  So if you've got a nine gallon pot or a three gallon pot,
[02:35:58.410 --> 02:35:59.650]  you want to use nine gallons of water.
[02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:00.730]  If you've got a five gallon pot,
[02:36:00.730 --> 02:36:03.930]  you want to put 15 gallons of water through that bitch.
[02:36:03.930 --> 02:36:05.050]  Right, is that what I said?
[02:36:05.050 --> 02:36:06.810]  Five gallon pot, 15 gallons of water, it's three times.
[02:36:06.810 --> 02:36:09.410]  Yeah, just making sure I'm doing good math here.
[02:36:09.410 --> 02:36:10.810]  Head injuries coming back.
[02:36:10.810 --> 02:36:12.290]  All right, so flush really good, you guys.
[02:36:12.290 --> 02:36:15.330]  I bitch a lot about cannabis because it's improperly flushed.
[02:36:16.770 --> 02:36:18.890]  When you're smoking a joint, if the joint won't stay lit,
[02:36:18.890 --> 02:36:20.730]  if you have to keep relighting it,
[02:36:20.730 --> 02:36:23.010]  there's a good chance it wasn't flushed properly
[02:36:23.010 --> 02:36:25.050]  or I rolled it and I don't roll with this shit.
[02:36:25.050 --> 02:36:28.650]  But if your ashes are black and chunky,
[02:36:28.690 --> 02:36:29.890]  there are still nutrients in there.
[02:36:29.890 --> 02:36:32.490]  You want a nice clean white ash
[02:36:32.490 --> 02:36:34.770]  that's nice and smooth and soft.
[02:36:34.770 --> 02:36:35.730]  You don't want chunks of it.
[02:36:35.730 --> 02:36:38.410]  If you ash into your hand, it should feel nice.
[02:36:38.410 --> 02:36:39.810]  You should almost enjoy that nice,
[02:36:39.810 --> 02:36:41.690]  smooth texture of the ashes
[02:36:41.690 --> 02:36:43.730]  if your plants were flushed properly.
[02:36:45.170 --> 02:36:47.170]  One of my biggest complaints about dispensary cannabis,
[02:36:47.170 --> 02:36:50.930]  and I am trying to fix this in my shop, they don't flush.
[02:36:50.930 --> 02:36:53.170]  They do not flush and they do not cure.
[02:36:53.170 --> 02:36:55.410]  They pretty much say, shit's done, cut it down and sell it.
[02:36:55.410 --> 02:36:56.250]  And I don't like that.
[02:36:56.250 --> 02:36:58.610]  So we're going to try to change that where I'm working.
[02:36:59.570 --> 02:37:00.410]  Flushing is important, you guys.
[02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:01.250]  I can't stress that.
[02:37:01.250 --> 02:37:03.410]  So from week eight, you want to flush,
[02:37:03.410 --> 02:37:05.130]  run plenty of clean water through that pot.
[02:37:05.130 --> 02:37:08.490]  Week nine, flushing is in full effect.
[02:37:08.490 --> 02:37:10.690]  Week nine ends at day 63.
[02:37:10.690 --> 02:37:13.290]  On day 60, here's what I recommend.
[02:37:13.290 --> 02:37:15.130]  Go in the grow room and start taking off
[02:37:15.130 --> 02:37:17.090]  all of the big fan leaves.
[02:37:17.090 --> 02:37:20.290]  Any leaf that has a petiole, that's a stem, you guys.
[02:37:20.290 --> 02:37:22.370]  Any leaf that has a stem that you can get to,
[02:37:22.370 --> 02:37:23.930]  take some scissors and cut that shit off
[02:37:23.930 --> 02:37:25.490]  really close to the bud.
[02:37:25.490 --> 02:37:27.650]  Just go in there and de-leaf the entire room.
[02:37:27.650 --> 02:37:29.490]  You don't need these leaves anymore.
[02:37:29.490 --> 02:37:32.130]  This is going to save you time when it comes to harvest.
[02:37:32.130 --> 02:37:33.490]  So day 60, you walked in there
[02:37:33.490 --> 02:37:36.690]  and you took off all of those leaves, boom.
[02:37:36.690 --> 02:37:38.490]  Now, this may sound crazy.
[02:37:38.490 --> 02:37:40.530]  This is what I do in my grows.
[02:37:40.530 --> 02:37:42.490]  I've got three days left, right?
[02:37:42.490 --> 02:37:45.530]  On the first, on day 61, I reduce my lights
[02:37:45.530 --> 02:37:47.730]  from 12, 12 to 10, 14.
[02:37:47.730 --> 02:37:50.210]  I'm on for 10 hours and I'm off for 14.
[02:37:50.210 --> 02:37:52.530]  The plants are going, oh shit, he's going to kill us now.
[02:37:52.530 --> 02:37:54.690]  The time is near, they know it.
[02:37:54.690 --> 02:37:57.130]  The next day, I'll drop them down to eight hours.
[02:37:57.810 --> 02:38:01.050]  And on day three, I'll give them 24 hours of total darkness.
[02:38:01.050 --> 02:38:03.690]  So day 63, no light at all.
[02:38:03.690 --> 02:38:05.650]  I'll leave them off for the entire day.
[02:38:06.650 --> 02:38:09.410]  Day 64, wake up bright and early, nice and ready.
[02:38:09.410 --> 02:38:12.850]  Go in and cut down the entire room and just let them hang.
[02:38:12.850 --> 02:38:14.050]  That's harvest day.
[02:38:14.050 --> 02:38:16.970]  That's 63 or 64 days, you guys.
[02:38:16.970 --> 02:38:18.090]  Nine weeks of full flower.
[02:38:18.090 --> 02:38:20.570]  I got through that in 30 minutes.
[02:38:20.570 --> 02:38:23.450]  I did have to kind of skip a couple of details.
[02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:24.290]  I'm going to take a drink.
[02:38:24.290 --> 02:38:25.410]  I'm sorry, I'm trying to talk right through this,
[02:38:25.410 --> 02:38:26.610]  but I got to throw a thing.
[02:38:26.610 --> 02:38:28.170]  Let me take a drink here.
[02:38:28.170 --> 02:38:29.250]  All right, that's a little better.
[02:38:29.250 --> 02:38:31.730]  I got you guys through nine weeks and 30 minutes.
[02:38:31.730 --> 02:38:34.050]  I left some stuff out, but I feel like that leaves me
[02:38:34.050 --> 02:38:35.890]  more shit to teach you guys and more tips
[02:38:35.890 --> 02:38:37.370]  to give you in the future.
[02:38:37.370 --> 02:38:40.370]  You'll survive a crop with everything I taught you.
[02:38:40.370 --> 02:38:41.430]  Something that I should mention,
[02:38:41.430 --> 02:38:43.570]  if you do grow a longer strain,
[02:38:43.570 --> 02:38:47.210]  I would recommend reducing the light to 11 hours on
[02:38:47.210 --> 02:38:50.290]  and 13 hours off around week nine.
[02:38:50.290 --> 02:38:51.730]  This is only if you're growing something
[02:38:51.730 --> 02:38:53.770]  that takes 11 weeks or more.
[02:38:54.210 --> 02:38:58.090]  Some sativas won't finish up without a shortened day period.
[02:38:58.090 --> 02:39:01.170]  The reason is they are from an area that only have
[02:39:01.170 --> 02:39:03.930]  a few hours difference in the natural day and night cycle.
[02:39:03.930 --> 02:39:05.610]  So we need to encourage them.
[02:39:05.610 --> 02:39:07.650]  Oh, excuse me, I just burped right into the microphone.
[02:39:07.650 --> 02:39:09.690]  We need to encourage these plants to finish up
[02:39:09.690 --> 02:39:11.370]  by shortening the days.
[02:39:11.370 --> 02:39:15.450]  What happens when we shorten the days is the plant realizes
[02:39:15.450 --> 02:39:19.490]  that winter is coming and our plant's main goal
[02:39:19.490 --> 02:39:22.930]  is to pollinate and create seeds.
[02:39:22.970 --> 02:39:24.810]  And since it hasn't received any pollen,
[02:39:24.810 --> 02:39:26.570]  it's kind of being stubborn about finishing.
[02:39:26.570 --> 02:39:29.770]  It's like, eh, I really think it's like a dude at a party.
[02:39:29.770 --> 02:39:31.250]  It thinks if it hangs out late enough,
[02:39:31.250 --> 02:39:33.090]  there's still a chance of getting laid.
[02:39:33.090 --> 02:39:35.730]  So what we gotta do is we gotta start messing with the lights
[02:39:35.730 --> 02:39:37.730]  and tell these guys, your time's up, dude.
[02:39:37.730 --> 02:39:39.570]  We gotta turn, tell the girls actually.
[02:39:39.570 --> 02:39:40.770]  We gotta turn the lights down
[02:39:40.770 --> 02:39:43.050]  and they'll start finishing on their own.
[02:39:43.050 --> 02:39:45.490]  Otherwise, some of these sativas will just keep on going.
[02:39:45.490 --> 02:39:49.090]  I had a Durban poison strain that went for 14 weeks
[02:39:49.090 --> 02:39:51.050]  and then I was getting tired of that bitch
[02:39:51.050 --> 02:39:51.970]  because I needed the room
[02:39:51.970 --> 02:39:55.170]  and I was done growing that strain in that crop
[02:39:55.170 --> 02:39:56.250]  and I wouldn't finish.
[02:39:56.250 --> 02:39:57.850]  And then I thought, well, why don't I just reduce
[02:39:57.850 --> 02:40:00.570]  the lights down a little bit and speed this up?
[02:40:00.570 --> 02:40:02.650]  And you know what, within one week of reducing the lights,
[02:40:02.650 --> 02:40:03.490]  it finished.
[02:40:03.490 --> 02:40:04.530]  I just had to tell it so.
[02:40:06.290 --> 02:40:09.890]  So also you may want to feed for a little bit longer
[02:40:09.890 --> 02:40:11.490]  if you're running a longer plant.
[02:40:11.490 --> 02:40:14.490]  I would extend the week six regimen.
[02:40:14.490 --> 02:40:16.490]  If you have to extend anything,
[02:40:16.490 --> 02:40:20.410]  just repeat week six until you get to the,
[02:40:21.410 --> 02:40:22.730]  like if you have three extra weeks,
[02:40:22.730 --> 02:40:24.450]  just do week six three extra times.
[02:40:24.450 --> 02:40:26.090]  That's what I'm trying to say here.
[02:40:26.090 --> 02:40:27.850]  Guys, my voice is burning out.
[02:40:27.850 --> 02:40:29.130]  I've got a little bit more stuff here,
[02:40:29.130 --> 02:40:30.450]  but I'm running out of throat.
[02:40:30.450 --> 02:40:32.410]  So I think we're gonna do another 35 minute show
[02:40:32.410 --> 02:40:34.850]  and wrap this bitch up, put a bow on it.
[02:40:35.730 --> 02:40:37.210]  I appreciate you guys for listening to me.

[02:40:50.610 --> 02:40:51.890]  it's at I read genetics.
[02:40:51.890 --> 02:40:54.130]  Send me a message on one of those platforms and say,
[02:40:54.130 --> 02:40:57.050]  hey bro, when you were doing your grow lesson,
[02:40:57.050 --> 02:40:59.730]  I needed to know this and you didn't tell me.
[02:40:59.730 --> 02:41:01.250]  And I will make a lesson out of that
[02:41:01.250 --> 02:41:02.970]  just for you in the future.
[02:41:02.970 --> 02:41:06.010]  Guys, I apologize that my throat is burning out here.
[02:41:06.010 --> 02:41:06.850]  Let's just wrap it up
[02:41:06.850 --> 02:41:08.610]  so I don't have to sound like shit anymore.
[02:41:08.610 --> 02:41:09.450]  Thanks for listening.
[02:41:09.450 --> 02:41:10.330]  I really do appreciate it.
[02:41:10.330 --> 02:41:12.050]  I think you can tell that my head's getting better.
[02:41:12.050 --> 02:41:13.250]  I really can.
[02:41:13.290 --> 02:41:16.690]  I ordered a product from on it.com called AlphaBrain.
[02:41:16.690 --> 02:41:18.850]  If you listen to Joe Rogan or any of those other podcasts,
[02:41:18.850 --> 02:41:20.290]  you've heard about AlphaBrain.
[02:41:20.290 --> 02:41:24.850]  AlphaBrain is used by public speakers and lecturers
[02:41:24.850 --> 02:41:26.930]  and folks in that type of a position
[02:41:26.930 --> 02:41:28.090]  that have to speak, right?
[02:41:28.090 --> 02:41:31.610]  But they say that AlphaBrain, it's a nootropic
[02:41:31.610 --> 02:41:34.170]  and it is supposed to increase your ability
[02:41:34.170 --> 02:41:37.450]  to recall names and facts and locations.
[02:41:37.450 --> 02:41:40.450]  And it's supposed to broaden your vocabulary.
[02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:43.730]  So maybe that'll improve my head injury
[02:41:43.730 --> 02:41:45.090]  and fix all my problems.
[02:41:46.130 --> 02:41:47.970]  All right, I really don't have a voice left.
[02:41:47.970 --> 02:41:49.570]  So don't forget to check out our sponsors,
[02:41:49.570 --> 02:41:50.610]  the Rocky Mountain Worm Company

[02:42:27.890 --> 02:42:29.210]  That's a donation button.
[02:42:29.210 --> 02:42:30.050]  Click on that.
[02:42:30.050 --> 02:42:32.370]  That goes directly to my PayPal account.
[02:42:32.370 --> 02:42:33.970]  I'm never gonna charge you guys for the podcast.
[02:42:33.970 --> 02:42:35.570]  This is always gonna be free.
[02:42:35.570 --> 02:42:38.530]  But if you feel like making a contribution to say thank you,
[02:42:38.530 --> 02:42:40.010]  I would definitely appreciate it.
[02:42:40.690 --> 02:42:43.090]  I do put at least three hours into every episode
[02:42:43.090 --> 02:42:44.930]  plus the hour that it takes to record.
[02:42:44.930 --> 02:42:47.210]  I do research, I write all this stuff out.
[02:42:47.210 --> 02:42:48.410]  I'm not asking for anything,
[02:42:48.410 --> 02:42:51.570]  but some people wanna do that and I'm not gonna stop you.
[02:42:51.570 --> 02:42:53.090]  So throw down if you want to.
[02:42:53.090 --> 02:42:54.610]  We are on all the social media sites.
[02:42:54.610 --> 02:42:56.210]  I think I already said that.
[02:42:56.210 --> 02:42:57.130]  Yeah, no more rambling.
[02:42:57.130 --> 02:42:58.610]  Dude, make sure you guys follow me on Instagram.
[02:42:58.610 --> 02:43:01.530]  I'm almost at 15,000 followers.
[02:43:01.530 --> 02:43:03.730]  I really wanna hit that 15,000 mark.
[02:43:03.730 --> 02:43:05.410]  I'm not sure why, but I do.
[02:43:05.410 --> 02:43:07.290]  Once again, big shout out to my Ninja Spins.
[02:43:07.290 --> 02:43:08.410]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[02:43:08.410 --> 02:43:10.730]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[02:43:10.730 --> 02:43:12.330]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:43:29.250 --> 02:43:30.850]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[02:43:30.850 --> 02:43:32.370]  It's time for episode number 70
[02:43:32.370 --> 02:43:34.090]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:43:34.090 --> 02:43:37.930]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[02:43:37.930 --> 02:43:39.010]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[02:43:39.010 --> 02:43:40.250]  if you're a professional grower,
[02:43:40.250 --> 02:43:42.290]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[02:43:42.290 --> 02:43:43.410]  if you're a cannabis activist
[02:43:43.410 --> 02:43:44.650]  or even someone who's just curious
[02:43:44.650 --> 02:43:46.330]  about the current state of cannabis,
[02:43:46.330 --> 02:43:48.650]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[02:43:49.570 --> 02:43:50.410]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[02:43:50.410 --> 02:43:51.650]  Thanks again for joining me.
[02:43:51.650 --> 02:43:53.850]  As always, I wanna send a big huge thank you shout out
[02:43:53.850 --> 02:43:54.810]  to the Mystic Roots band
[02:43:54.810 --> 02:43:56.530]  for letting me use their music on the show.
[02:43:56.530 --> 02:43:59.010]  Thanks to Cat Coop and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[02:43:59.010 --> 02:44:00.050]  The song you're listening to right now
[02:44:00.050 --> 02:44:01.610]  is called the Doggy Dub.
[02:44:01.610 --> 02:44:04.130]  Make sure you support my friends in the Mystic Roots crew.
[02:44:04.130 --> 02:44:04.970]  What's up, everybody?
[02:44:04.970 --> 02:44:07.250]  I've got a great show put together for you guys.
[02:44:07.250 --> 02:44:08.090]  I'm gonna turn that music down.
[02:44:08.090 --> 02:44:09.810]  That's really distracting.
[02:44:09.810 --> 02:44:10.650]  Just cut that right out.
[02:44:10.650 --> 02:44:11.610]  There we go.
[02:44:11.610 --> 02:44:13.170]  So I got a few things I wanna talk about.
[02:44:13.170 --> 02:44:14.890]  First, I wanna give a huge shout out
[02:44:14.890 --> 02:44:17.610]  to everybody that's helped me out this past week.
[02:44:17.610 --> 02:44:18.850]  I was driving up to Colorado Springs
[02:44:18.850 --> 02:44:21.570]  to go see our good friends Hunt and Damsel
[02:44:22.490 --> 02:44:23.330]  and of course the Jordans.
[02:44:23.330 --> 02:44:25.450]  And of course, John Randalls Jr.
[02:44:25.450 --> 02:44:26.450]  was headed up there to Springs.
[02:44:26.450 --> 02:44:28.650]  Was gonna go pay them a visit.
[02:44:28.650 --> 02:44:31.250]  And the fucking transmission went out on my car
[02:44:31.250 --> 02:44:34.410]  about a mile from Colorado Springs.
[02:44:34.410 --> 02:44:36.530]  I could see the first exit in Colorado Springs.
[02:44:36.530 --> 02:44:39.690]  I could see the damn circle drive Lake Avenue sign
[02:44:39.690 --> 02:44:40.530]  right in front of me,
[02:44:40.530 --> 02:44:41.530]  but I just couldn't get off the highway.
[02:44:41.530 --> 02:44:43.970]  My car pretty much exploded, it felt like.
[02:44:43.970 --> 02:44:45.730]  I was doing a good 75 miles an hour
[02:44:45.730 --> 02:44:48.050]  on the interstate in the rain.
[02:44:48.050 --> 02:44:50.250]  It felt like my car downshifted.
[02:44:50.250 --> 02:44:53.890]  From 75, I immediately was going about 45 miles an hour.
[02:44:53.890 --> 02:44:55.650]  It sounded like, it was sort of like,
[02:44:55.650 --> 02:44:56.650]  and then it was like,
[02:44:57.610 --> 02:44:59.250]  is what it felt like to me.
[02:44:59.250 --> 02:45:01.290]  I felt like my engine was trying to jump out of the car
[02:45:01.290 --> 02:45:02.130]  and into my lap.
[02:45:02.130 --> 02:45:03.810]  So of course I hit the brakes,
[02:45:03.810 --> 02:45:05.330]  signaled, got over as quickly as I could,
[02:45:05.330 --> 02:45:07.490]  got to the side of the road, turn on the hazards.
[02:45:07.490 --> 02:45:09.090]  Called AAA, it took AAA.
[02:45:09.090 --> 02:45:11.050]  They quoted me 85 minutes to get there.
[02:45:11.050 --> 02:45:12.410]  They got there in 65.
[02:45:12.410 --> 02:45:16.050]  So fucking 85 minute is a long,
[02:45:16.050 --> 02:45:17.370]  85 minute wait is a long wait.
[02:45:17.370 --> 02:45:19.530]  65 minutes was less than what they promised me.
[02:45:19.570 --> 02:45:22.770]  So I guess that that's a good job on AAA's part.
[02:45:22.770 --> 02:45:24.610]  I made friends with the AAA tow truck driver.
[02:45:24.610 --> 02:45:26.410]  I wish I had your business card with me right now
[02:45:26.410 --> 02:45:28.450]  in my pocket, but I have said it somewhere.
[02:45:28.450 --> 02:45:29.610]  You know what, it's actually in the car
[02:45:29.610 --> 02:45:31.850]  that's broken down that is at the mechanic shop.
[02:45:31.850 --> 02:45:33.050]  So once I get your card out of there,
[02:45:33.050 --> 02:45:34.130]  I'll give you a shout out on the show
[02:45:34.130 --> 02:45:36.290]  because the truck driver was a cool guy.
[02:45:36.290 --> 02:45:37.130]  They did a great job.
[02:45:37.130 --> 02:45:37.970]  They were super kind.
[02:45:37.970 --> 02:45:39.770]  They had to tell me about 50 miles home,
[02:45:39.770 --> 02:45:42.330]  get me back to the house, but I'm here, I'm safe.
[02:45:42.330 --> 02:45:43.770]  I don't have a car for a little bit here.
[02:45:43.770 --> 02:45:45.210]  We're figuring that out.
[02:45:45.210 --> 02:45:46.050]  It's going to cost a little bit
[02:45:46.050 --> 02:45:47.650]  to get that son of a bitch fixed.
[02:45:47.650 --> 02:45:48.970]  But anyway, trying to move on,
[02:45:49.410 --> 02:45:51.050]  trying to have a good week.
[02:45:51.050 --> 02:45:52.130]  We are going to talk about cannabis here,
[02:45:52.130 --> 02:45:53.970]  but I want to talk a little bit first.
[02:45:53.970 --> 02:45:55.010]  You guys know that I hit my head
[02:45:55.010 --> 02:45:56.170]  at the beginning of April, right?
[02:45:56.170 --> 02:45:58.170]  And it is now, I'm recording this.
[02:45:58.170 --> 02:46:01.010]  The date is May 14th as we record.
[02:46:02.250 --> 02:46:05.890]  I feel like I'm getting it back together so much, you guys.
[02:46:05.890 --> 02:46:07.690]  I want to thank you for tolerating my bullshit
[02:46:07.690 --> 02:46:09.010]  while I've had a head wound.
[02:46:09.010 --> 02:46:11.210]  I know I've been goofy, I really do.
[02:46:11.210 --> 02:46:12.210]  I wasn't all there.
[02:46:12.210 --> 02:46:13.250]  I apologize.
[02:46:13.250 --> 02:46:14.850]  You guys that stuck with me, you're my friends.
[02:46:14.850 --> 02:46:15.690]  I love you.
[02:46:15.690 --> 02:46:16.570]  Thanks for supporting the show.
[02:46:16.570 --> 02:46:19.050]  Thanks for being there while I was kind of down.
[02:46:19.050 --> 02:46:21.450]  I want to talk about a product I ordered online.
[02:46:21.450 --> 02:46:23.410]  I've been taking something called AlphaBrain.
[02:46:23.410 --> 02:46:25.010]  You can get it at onnit.com.
[02:46:25.010 --> 02:46:26.050]  There's two N's in that.
[02:46:26.050 --> 02:46:27.690]  It's O-N-N-I-T.
[02:46:27.690 --> 02:46:29.490]  Onnit Labs makes a lot of great products.
[02:46:29.490 --> 02:46:31.130]  I'm going to reach for my bottle of AlphaBrain right here.
[02:46:31.130 --> 02:46:31.970]  Hold on.
[02:46:33.050 --> 02:46:34.450]  All right, I got the bottle in my hand.
[02:46:34.450 --> 02:46:36.930]  AlphaBrain is a complete earth grown nootropic
[02:46:36.930 --> 02:46:39.730]  with Alpha GPC and AC11.
[02:46:39.730 --> 02:46:41.270]  I know that sounds like a bunch of bullshit to you guys,
[02:46:41.270 --> 02:46:46.270]  but they say that lecturers, educators,
[02:46:46.730 --> 02:46:49.530]  speakers, public speakers, radio personalities,
[02:46:49.530 --> 02:46:51.890]  and folks like that use AlphaBrain.
[02:46:51.890 --> 02:46:54.010]  The guy that inspired me to use it is Joe Rogan.
[02:46:54.010 --> 02:46:55.530]  When Joe Rogan does his podcast,
[02:46:55.530 --> 02:46:57.250]  he takes a couple of AlphaBrain.
[02:46:57.250 --> 02:46:58.650]  When he does the UFC events,
[02:46:58.650 --> 02:47:01.770]  he announces, commentates on the UFCs.
[02:47:01.770 --> 02:47:04.130]  He does three AlphaBrain pills for that.
[02:47:04.130 --> 02:47:05.930]  I've been taking two a day
[02:47:05.930 --> 02:47:09.170]  and I can feel a sharpness in my brain.
[02:47:09.170 --> 02:47:11.010]  My vocabulary is stronger.
[02:47:12.090 --> 02:47:13.370]  I had a problem after I hit my head.
[02:47:13.370 --> 02:47:15.250]  I would try to recall words and I'd say,
[02:47:15.250 --> 02:47:17.930]  hey, can you hand me my,
[02:47:17.930 --> 02:47:20.290]  and I just couldn't think of what basic words were,
[02:47:20.290 --> 02:47:22.690]  like screwdriver or flashlight.
[02:47:22.690 --> 02:47:24.650]  Sometimes I would just forget words,
[02:47:24.650 --> 02:47:27.610]  but the AlphaBrain is making that shit come back to me.
[02:47:27.610 --> 02:47:28.730]  It's making me a better speaker.
[02:47:28.730 --> 02:47:31.930]  It's making me remember and recall more.
[02:47:31.930 --> 02:47:33.090]  It's making me calmer.
[02:47:33.090 --> 02:47:35.170]  I've described it as, maybe I've said this on the show,
[02:47:35.170 --> 02:47:36.930]  maybe I'm full of shit with my memory thing,
[02:47:36.930 --> 02:47:38.970]  but I've described it as my brain has
[02:47:38.970 --> 02:47:40.330]  the main track that's happening.
[02:47:40.330 --> 02:47:41.690]  There's like the, you gotta wake up,
[02:47:41.690 --> 02:47:43.090]  you gotta poop, you gotta brush your teeth,
[02:47:43.090 --> 02:47:44.250]  you gotta get to work on time,
[02:47:44.250 --> 02:47:46.610]  you gotta do your chores, you gotta call this person.
[02:47:46.610 --> 02:47:47.930]  You know, that track is playing in your head,
[02:47:47.930 --> 02:47:49.490]  but there's always that side bullshit
[02:47:49.490 --> 02:47:52.530]  that goes on in your head, like taxes,
[02:47:52.530 --> 02:47:54.130]  and it just whispers at you occasionally,
[02:47:54.130 --> 02:47:56.730]  or I wonder what that girl's doing,
[02:47:56.730 --> 02:47:58.810]  or I miss somebody, or just bullshit
[02:47:58.810 --> 02:48:00.250]  that happens in your head that you really don't need
[02:48:00.250 --> 02:48:01.610]  to be focusing on right now.
[02:48:01.610 --> 02:48:03.810]  I feel like weird things pop up into your head
[02:48:03.810 --> 02:48:07.170]  and the AlphaBrain has kind of quieted that secondary track.
[02:48:07.170 --> 02:48:08.330]  It's where I'm able to focus on
[02:48:08.330 --> 02:48:10.610]  what I'm supposed to focus on,
[02:48:10.610 --> 02:48:12.090]  which gets me to my point.
[02:48:12.090 --> 02:48:13.610]  The podcasts are getting much better, you guys.
[02:48:13.970 --> 02:48:16.490]  I'm gonna make the podcast a lot better, much, much better.
[02:48:16.490 --> 02:48:19.210]  So shout out to AlphaBrain, shout out to Onnit Labs.
[02:48:19.210 --> 02:48:22.690]  I take two a day and I definitely feel,
[02:48:22.690 --> 02:48:24.610]  I'm more talkative, but it's because my thoughts
[02:48:24.610 --> 02:48:26.530]  are more clear and I can put together
[02:48:26.530 --> 02:48:29.810]  much better sentences, much better podcasts, definitely.
[02:48:29.810 --> 02:48:31.330]  Oh, dude, I got the phone on loud here.
[02:48:31.330 --> 02:48:32.530]  That's ridiculous.
[02:48:32.530 --> 02:48:33.610]  It put that bitch on silent.
[02:48:33.610 --> 02:48:36.250]  I apologize, that's very unprofessional podcast behavior.
[02:48:36.250 --> 02:48:37.250]  Here we go.
[02:48:37.250 --> 02:48:39.410]  I got the phone on silent.
[02:48:39.410 --> 02:48:42.090]  So I wanna talk about another product.
[02:48:42.090 --> 02:48:43.770]  You heard us talk about Floria
[02:48:43.770 --> 02:48:45.650]  on a previous podcast episode.
[02:48:45.650 --> 02:48:48.290]  Floria is a medicated personal lubricant,
[02:48:48.290 --> 02:48:51.090]  which means it's a sexual lubricant
[02:48:51.090 --> 02:48:52.490]  that contains cannabis.
[02:48:53.370 --> 02:48:55.730]  Somebody heard that I talked about it on the show
[02:48:55.730 --> 02:48:58.410]  and they gave me a product called Evose.
[02:48:58.410 --> 02:49:00.930]  And from what I can tell, Evose and Floria
[02:49:00.930 --> 02:49:03.610]  are very, very similar, fairly similar
[02:49:03.610 --> 02:49:04.850]  was what I wanted to say.
[02:49:05.770 --> 02:49:08.850]  They are both coconut oil infused with cannabis
[02:49:08.850 --> 02:49:10.970]  and they are meant to be applied to,
[02:49:11.410 --> 02:49:12.890]  instructions pretty much say apply it
[02:49:12.890 --> 02:49:14.010]  to the female's parts.
[02:49:14.010 --> 02:49:15.770]  So I'm gonna be straight up about this.
[02:49:15.770 --> 02:49:20.770]  I got some Evose and I sprayed it up on my partner's goods
[02:49:21.570 --> 02:49:23.610]  and it made a difference.
[02:49:23.610 --> 02:49:27.730]  It definitely, there was nothing to complain about before.
[02:49:27.730 --> 02:49:28.810]  Everything was going just fine.
[02:49:28.810 --> 02:49:31.690]  But when we added that stuff, it made it a little,
[02:49:31.690 --> 02:49:32.850]  it made my junk warm.
[02:49:32.850 --> 02:49:35.010]  It felt like, it's already warm, I know,
[02:49:35.010 --> 02:49:37.050]  but it felt a little warmer and tinglier.
[02:49:37.050 --> 02:49:39.770]  It made my stuff feel a little more alert.
[02:49:40.050 --> 02:49:42.570]  It was definitely a heightened experience.
[02:49:42.570 --> 02:49:43.610]  And she agreed.
[02:49:43.610 --> 02:49:45.770]  She said that it was definitely a heightened experience.
[02:49:45.770 --> 02:49:47.690]  It's just coconut oil and cannabis.
[02:49:47.690 --> 02:49:50.330]  So I had no worries about putting it on my body
[02:49:50.330 --> 02:49:52.490]  or in her body or whatever.
[02:49:52.490 --> 02:49:55.610]  It washed off really cleanly and really quickly.
[02:49:55.610 --> 02:49:57.970]  One funny thing that I said when I was done,
[02:49:57.970 --> 02:49:59.530]  and I'm sorry if I'm being too explicit, you guys,
[02:49:59.530 --> 02:50:02.250]  but it's my podcast and I'll talk about my dick if I want.
[02:50:02.250 --> 02:50:07.250]  When I was done, I was, I felt, I wasn't,
[02:50:07.610 --> 02:50:09.650]  okay, I was all done and soft, I'm all floppy,
[02:50:10.490 --> 02:50:11.650]  but I felt like my dick was fluffy.
[02:50:11.650 --> 02:50:13.250]  Like I've given somebody a massage
[02:50:13.250 --> 02:50:14.930]  with apothecary lotion before,
[02:50:14.930 --> 02:50:15.930]  and I've explained my hands,
[02:50:15.930 --> 02:50:18.210]  like feeling like I was wearing Mickey Mouse gloves.
[02:50:18.210 --> 02:50:21.050]  My dick felt like it was fluffy, like to the touch.
[02:50:21.050 --> 02:50:21.890]  If I would touch it,
[02:50:21.890 --> 02:50:24.570]  I felt like it was thicker than it was.
[02:50:24.570 --> 02:50:27.570]  That's a weird, okay, enough about my dong on the show.
[02:50:27.570 --> 02:50:30.650]  But I tried the Evos and if you're looking for something
[02:50:30.650 --> 02:50:31.810]  to add to the bedroom fun,
[02:50:31.810 --> 02:50:34.690]  and you want to go to the dispensary and spend a few bucks,
[02:50:34.690 --> 02:50:35.850]  there's nothing wrong with Evos.
[02:50:35.850 --> 02:50:36.690]  It worked.
[02:50:36.690 --> 02:50:37.530]  I would use it.
[02:50:37.530 --> 02:50:38.370]  I would do that again.
[02:50:38.370 --> 02:50:40.810]  If you're wondering, let's do that again.
[02:50:40.810 --> 02:50:42.610]  So we talked about Alpha Brain.
[02:50:42.610 --> 02:50:44.230]  We talked about Evos.
[02:50:44.230 --> 02:50:45.490]  Let's change the tone a little bit.
[02:50:45.490 --> 02:50:47.890]  This is something that is not good that happens.
[02:50:49.010 --> 02:50:51.150]  I was trying to explain to a friend something,
[02:50:51.150 --> 02:50:52.310]  and I don't know the science behind it,
[02:50:52.310 --> 02:50:53.670]  but I know that this is happening.
[02:50:53.670 --> 02:50:55.850]  When my dab rig gets dirty,
[02:50:55.850 --> 02:50:58.130]  my chunk of globby resin in there,
[02:50:58.130 --> 02:51:00.410]  and this probably applies to the bong with bong resin
[02:51:00.410 --> 02:51:01.370]  if you're just smoking flour,
[02:51:01.370 --> 02:51:04.410]  but I've noticed that when I'm hitting the dab rig,
[02:51:04.410 --> 02:51:05.930]  once the rig gets dirty,
[02:51:05.930 --> 02:51:07.630]  I feel like that chunk of resin in there
[02:51:07.630 --> 02:51:10.110]  is actually stealing part of my dab.
[02:51:10.110 --> 02:51:11.810]  I feel like when you've got a big floater,
[02:51:11.810 --> 02:51:12.930]  if you look at my rig right now,
[02:51:12.930 --> 02:51:15.230]  there is like a quarter gram of hash
[02:51:15.230 --> 02:51:16.590]  just floating in my rig water,
[02:51:16.590 --> 02:51:17.770]  and it's not old.
[02:51:17.770 --> 02:51:18.670]  The rig water's only been in there
[02:51:18.670 --> 02:51:20.870]  for three or four days at the most.
[02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:22.350]  We just dab heavy here.
[02:51:22.350 --> 02:51:24.630]  The sea nail never turns off, you guys.
[02:51:24.630 --> 02:51:25.550]  It's like the coffee pot.
[02:51:25.550 --> 02:51:26.990]  It turns on at a certain time in the morning,
[02:51:26.990 --> 02:51:29.230]  and then it goes off right when I go to bed.
[02:51:29.230 --> 02:51:31.510]  So I'm taking big fat globs, right?
[02:51:31.510 --> 02:51:33.110]  I'll clean the rig and take fat globs.
[02:51:33.110 --> 02:51:35.310]  Fat globs, I get super baked, just like I should,
[02:51:35.350 --> 02:51:36.430]  but as the rig gets dirtier,
[02:51:36.430 --> 02:51:38.870]  I stop getting as high and stop choking
[02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:41.410]  and stop enjoying my dab as much as it gets dirtier.
[02:51:41.410 --> 02:51:42.950]  I think that chunk of resin in there
[02:51:42.950 --> 02:51:44.710]  collects the resin that's the smoke.
[02:51:44.710 --> 02:51:46.590]  It collects all your cannabinoids and your smoke
[02:51:46.590 --> 02:51:47.950]  and your whatever you're trying to get.
[02:51:47.950 --> 02:51:50.270]  It sticks to that ball and it's ripping you off.
[02:51:50.270 --> 02:51:52.910]  So my point, clean your fucking rig.
[02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:54.570]  Go get some rubbing alcohol.
[02:51:54.570 --> 02:51:55.830]  If it's really super sticky,
[02:51:55.830 --> 02:51:57.670]  get yourself some kosher salt.
[02:51:57.670 --> 02:51:59.630]  Fill the rig halfway up with alcohol.
[02:51:59.630 --> 02:52:00.910]  Put a little bit of kosher salt in there.
[02:52:00.910 --> 02:52:02.390]  The salt is working as an abrasive.
[02:52:02.390 --> 02:52:04.470]  It's gonna scratch all that resin off of there.
[02:52:04.470 --> 02:52:05.590]  Cover up both holes.
[02:52:06.510 --> 02:52:08.210]  Go somewhere where you got a carpeted floor,
[02:52:08.210 --> 02:52:09.050]  if you're a pothead,
[02:52:09.050 --> 02:52:10.550]  and just shake the shit out of that rig.
[02:52:10.550 --> 02:52:11.990]  And the reason we're going to the carpeted floor
[02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:13.390]  is so that when you drop the rig,
[02:52:13.390 --> 02:52:15.710]  you have a better chance of living.
[02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:16.550]  Just be careful.
[02:52:16.550 --> 02:52:18.190]  Just go shake the shit out of that rig.
[02:52:18.190 --> 02:52:20.990]  And then, yeah, I know it's disgusting,
[02:52:20.990 --> 02:52:22.670]  but just pour all that fucking reclaim
[02:52:22.670 --> 02:52:23.850]  right down the drain and get rid of it.
[02:52:23.850 --> 02:52:24.830]  You don't want that.
[02:52:24.830 --> 02:52:25.830]  I know a lot of people that use it.
[02:52:25.830 --> 02:52:27.390]  I'm not gonna hate on you if you do.
[02:52:27.390 --> 02:52:28.230]  I wouldn't use it,
[02:52:28.230 --> 02:52:30.150]  especially if you just mix alcohol into it.
[02:52:30.150 --> 02:52:32.790]  But flush that shit right down the drain, get rid of it.
[02:52:32.790 --> 02:52:34.290]  And then rinse the rig out a couple of times
[02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:35.950]  with some super hot water.
[02:52:35.950 --> 02:52:36.770]  Let it dry.
[02:52:36.770 --> 02:52:37.690]  Let it cool down to a normal temp.
[02:52:37.690 --> 02:52:40.410]  Fill it back up with water, the right depth.
[02:52:40.410 --> 02:52:41.250]  What is that?
[02:52:41.250 --> 02:52:42.930]  The right amount of water, whatever, the right level.
[02:52:42.930 --> 02:52:43.850]  Throw your nail on there
[02:52:43.850 --> 02:52:45.650]  and get down on some clean, tasty dabs
[02:52:45.650 --> 02:52:47.390]  and enjoy the flavor of your dabs again.
[02:52:47.390 --> 02:52:49.450]  I really think a clean rig is more important
[02:52:49.450 --> 02:52:51.490]  than people realize.
[02:52:51.490 --> 02:52:53.010]  All right, that's enough of that PSA.
[02:52:53.010 --> 02:52:55.290]  I've got more shit written down here.
[02:52:55.290 --> 02:52:57.530]  What else is next?
[02:52:57.530 --> 02:52:58.590]  Somebody was asking me,
[02:52:58.590 --> 02:53:00.130]  I got an email or a Facebook message.
[02:53:00.130 --> 02:53:01.810]  I cannot recall where it came from right now,
[02:53:01.810 --> 02:53:04.610]  but somebody was asking me about rig selection.
[02:53:04.610 --> 02:53:06.350]  How do I choose a good rig?
[02:53:07.230 --> 02:53:09.950]  Personally, if you're dabbing,
[02:53:09.950 --> 02:53:12.770]  I prefer a small rig over a big piece.
[02:53:12.770 --> 02:53:15.710]  The reason we used to smoke pot out of a giant bong
[02:53:15.710 --> 02:53:17.570]  is so that you can fill all that space
[02:53:17.570 --> 02:53:20.130]  with a big, thick, chunky hit of smoke.
[02:53:20.130 --> 02:53:21.450]  And then when you pull that carb
[02:53:21.450 --> 02:53:23.310]  or you pull the bowl out or you take your finger off,
[02:53:23.310 --> 02:53:25.250]  however you carve your bong,
[02:53:25.250 --> 02:53:26.090]  if you're from the 70s,
[02:53:26.090 --> 02:53:28.090]  you just take your finger off that hole in the back.
[02:53:28.090 --> 02:53:30.010]  If you're from the future, you got to pull the stem out.
[02:53:30.010 --> 02:53:30.850]  When you carve it,
[02:53:30.850 --> 02:53:32.690]  you're supposed to get all that fucking smoke
[02:53:32.690 --> 02:53:33.850]  into your lungs right at once.
[02:53:33.850 --> 02:53:35.970]  Boom, you just got a big old bong hit.
[02:53:35.970 --> 02:53:37.450]  And that's why you get baked from the bong.
[02:53:37.450 --> 02:53:38.530]  That's the purpose.
[02:53:38.530 --> 02:53:41.590]  Fill that piece, clear it, get all your smoke.
[02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:42.930]  When we're smoking dabs,
[02:53:43.930 --> 02:53:45.130]  your dab is just burning up
[02:53:45.130 --> 02:53:46.050]  right when you put it on the nail
[02:53:46.050 --> 02:53:47.890]  and you start smoking and you're getting it.
[02:53:47.890 --> 02:53:50.210]  I don't think we need a big ass piece for a dab.
[02:53:50.210 --> 02:53:51.570]  I like a little tiny rig
[02:53:51.570 --> 02:53:52.810]  to where when you put it on there,
[02:53:52.810 --> 02:53:54.370]  you put the carb cap on there,
[02:53:54.370 --> 02:53:57.490]  you inhale, you get that smoke right to your face.
[02:53:57.490 --> 02:54:00.010]  We're not trying to build a whole bunch of smoke
[02:54:00.010 --> 02:54:01.610]  into one chamber and then clear it.
[02:54:01.610 --> 02:54:03.270]  We just want that dab to go through the rig,
[02:54:03.270 --> 02:54:06.650]  through the water to cool and then into your face.
[02:54:06.650 --> 02:54:09.330]  So my main recommendation is something kind of small.
[02:54:09.330 --> 02:54:11.450]  My favorite rig, and you're going to think I'm crazy,
[02:54:11.450 --> 02:54:13.950]  but my favorite rig is my Hitman Sidecar.
[02:54:13.950 --> 02:54:15.210]  It's just the right height.
[02:54:15.210 --> 02:54:18.250]  I'm thinking that's probably five inches tall,
[02:54:18.250 --> 02:54:19.530]  something like that.
[02:54:19.530 --> 02:54:20.490]  If you go up to the mouthpiece,
[02:54:20.490 --> 02:54:22.090]  it's probably seven inches tall.
[02:54:23.130 --> 02:54:23.970]  It's a little rig.
[02:54:23.970 --> 02:54:25.370]  I like my Mad Rob Rig.
[02:54:25.370 --> 02:54:28.010]  That sucker's probably four inches tall at the most.
[02:54:28.970 --> 02:54:32.030]  You don't need a lot of percolation on a rig.
[02:54:32.030 --> 02:54:34.530]  If you've got something that gets plenty of bubbles,
[02:54:34.530 --> 02:54:35.930]  you don't need a lot of diffusion.
[02:54:35.930 --> 02:54:38.630]  All you want to do is cool your dab smoke.
[02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:40.450]  You don't want it coming off of that hot nail
[02:54:40.450 --> 02:54:41.570]  directly into your lungs.
[02:54:41.570 --> 02:54:42.770]  So you put a little water through there,
[02:54:42.770 --> 02:54:44.490]  just enough to cool it.
[02:54:44.490 --> 02:54:46.810]  I don't like a lot of water on my rig.
[02:54:46.810 --> 02:54:49.530]  And also I think over percolation on a dab,
[02:54:49.530 --> 02:54:52.450]  if you've got too many sections of water,
[02:54:52.450 --> 02:54:53.370]  you're kind of overdoing it.
[02:54:53.370 --> 02:54:56.050]  I like the Toro cans that have the tree perk
[02:54:56.050 --> 02:54:57.610]  and then it's got the little shower head perk
[02:54:57.610 --> 02:54:58.450]  in the middle.
[02:54:58.450 --> 02:54:59.270]  Those are great.
[02:54:59.270 --> 02:55:01.410]  But my favorite is the Hitman.
[02:55:01.410 --> 02:55:03.930]  I really do like the Mothership rigs.
[02:55:03.930 --> 02:55:05.050]  Those things hit like a boss,
[02:55:05.050 --> 02:55:07.650]  but you're looking at like 2,500 to 3,000 for a rig.
[02:55:07.650 --> 02:55:09.530]  If you're asking me for advice,
[02:55:09.530 --> 02:55:11.890]  you don't need advice on a Mothership.
[02:55:11.890 --> 02:55:13.610]  Get yourself a nice Hitman rig.
[02:55:13.610 --> 02:55:15.050]  Don't be afraid of,
[02:55:15.050 --> 02:55:17.290]  you don't have to buy name brand glass.
[02:55:17.290 --> 02:55:19.650]  Just keep in mind that if you're buying Chinese made glass,
[02:55:19.650 --> 02:55:21.890]  there's probably some Chinese little kid making it
[02:55:21.890 --> 02:55:23.430]  in unsafe conditions.
[02:55:23.430 --> 02:55:24.990]  They don't have good eye protection.
[02:55:24.990 --> 02:55:26.670]  They're probably barefoot.
[02:55:26.670 --> 02:55:27.510]  Just try to,
[02:55:27.510 --> 02:55:30.110]  maybe you can buy some American glass and do that.
[02:55:30.110 --> 02:55:32.510]  It's worth the extra few bucks just to know
[02:55:32.510 --> 02:55:34.510]  that you have ethically made glass.
[02:55:34.510 --> 02:55:35.710]  I think it's some karma.
[02:55:36.510 --> 02:55:37.990]  Like I said, Hitman's a good company.
[02:55:37.990 --> 02:55:39.350]  They don't support the show or anything,
[02:55:39.350 --> 02:55:40.630]  but they're always innovators.
[02:55:40.630 --> 02:55:42.950]  They lead the glass game in my opinion.
[02:55:42.950 --> 02:55:43.830]  If you want to go expensive,
[02:55:43.830 --> 02:55:46.430]  get yourself a coil or some beer glass
[02:55:46.430 --> 02:55:47.310]  or something like that.
[02:55:47.310 --> 02:55:48.950]  Coil is going to be ridiculous, you guys.
[02:55:48.950 --> 02:55:51.210]  I'm just talking about my favorite rigs here.
[02:55:51.210 --> 02:55:52.910]  One thing I'm going to mention.
[02:55:52.950 --> 02:55:55.870]  So get a small rig without a lot of percolation,
[02:55:55.870 --> 02:55:57.470]  something that keeps the nail a little bit away
[02:55:57.470 --> 02:55:58.310]  from your face.
[02:55:58.310 --> 02:56:00.270]  When you're checking out these rigs at the store,
[02:56:00.270 --> 02:56:01.710]  try to put the nail that you're going to buy
[02:56:01.710 --> 02:56:03.030]  right on that rig.
[02:56:03.030 --> 02:56:06.070]  And then see how far away that nail is from your face.
[02:56:06.070 --> 02:56:08.530]  Cause I don't really like the nail higher
[02:56:08.530 --> 02:56:10.790]  than the mouthpiece or real right at my face.
[02:56:10.790 --> 02:56:12.950]  I need it a couple inches away from my nose
[02:56:12.950 --> 02:56:14.710]  so that I can see where I'm putting the dab.
[02:56:14.710 --> 02:56:16.950]  I don't want to go cross-eyed.
[02:56:16.950 --> 02:56:17.790]  All right.
[02:56:17.790 --> 02:56:18.610]  The important part,
[02:56:18.610 --> 02:56:20.650]  the most important part when you're buying a rig
[02:56:20.650 --> 02:56:22.150]  is the nail.
[02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:24.430]  That's what you're heating up to a couple of hundred
[02:56:24.430 --> 02:56:25.250]  degrees.
[02:56:25.250 --> 02:56:26.510]  That's what you're putting your extract on.
[02:56:26.510 --> 02:56:28.430]  It's going to be heated and cooled and heated and cooled
[02:56:28.430 --> 02:56:29.790]  all the time.
[02:56:29.790 --> 02:56:30.630]  Oh, excuse me.
[02:56:30.630 --> 02:56:31.450]  I'm burping here.
[02:56:31.450 --> 02:56:32.290]  I'm going to take a drink right quick.
[02:56:32.290 --> 02:56:39.430]  Excuse me.
[02:56:39.430 --> 02:56:40.270]  All right.
[02:56:40.270 --> 02:56:41.090]  I apologize for the silence.
[02:56:41.090 --> 02:56:42.310]  I needed a drink.
[02:56:42.310 --> 02:56:44.510]  So get a good quality titanium nail.
[02:56:44.510 --> 02:56:47.670]  The only brand I will recommend for titanium
[02:56:47.670 --> 02:56:49.350]  is highly educated titanium.
[02:56:49.350 --> 02:56:50.910]  They make a nail for your rig.
[02:56:50.910 --> 02:56:52.370]  No matter what you're trying to do,
[02:56:52.370 --> 02:56:55.230]  highly educated has got the perfect nail for you.
[02:56:55.230 --> 02:56:56.150]  I promise.
[02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:57.750]  If you need guidance on the nail, hit me up,
[02:56:57.750 --> 02:56:59.430]  send me a picture of your rig.
[02:56:59.430 --> 02:57:01.190]  I'll tell you what kind of nail to buy.
[02:57:03.070 --> 02:57:05.750]  I do really like the quartz nails.
[02:57:05.750 --> 02:57:08.030]  If you get a good quality quartz nail,
[02:57:08.030 --> 02:57:10.090]  I recommend the Halen Honey Hole.
[02:57:10.090 --> 02:57:11.630]  If you do big fat dabs,
[02:57:11.630 --> 02:57:14.110]  if you're into smoking solventless and BHO,
[02:57:14.110 --> 02:57:15.830]  definitely get the Honey Hole.
[02:57:15.830 --> 02:57:17.750]  It holds a lot of heat for when you smoke solventless.
[02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:19.990]  It's got a lot of room to get a big solventless dab
[02:57:19.990 --> 02:57:21.070]  in there.
[02:57:21.070 --> 02:57:22.890]  I also like the Quave Banger.
[02:57:23.990 --> 02:57:25.990]  The Quave Banger is going to be a little bit pricey,
[02:57:26.830 --> 02:57:27.670]  but they are awesome.
[02:57:27.670 --> 02:57:29.510]  They taste super clean.
[02:57:29.510 --> 02:57:30.590]  Who just made the trough?
[02:57:30.590 --> 02:57:32.430]  Was that Joel Halen that just made the trough?
[02:57:32.430 --> 02:57:34.710]  I've not had a chance to try the trough yet,
[02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:35.990]  but they look amazing.
[02:57:35.990 --> 02:57:38.070]  If it's made out of good quality quartz,
[02:57:38.070 --> 02:57:41.590]  I bet it's going to be a good quartz banger.
[02:57:41.590 --> 02:57:44.190]  There is a company that is selling,
[02:57:44.190 --> 02:57:45.350]  they call them quartz bangers.
[02:57:45.350 --> 02:57:46.890]  It's the nail that it's quartz.
[02:57:46.890 --> 02:57:48.270]  It looks like a faucet spout,
[02:57:48.270 --> 02:57:50.110]  kind of with a little bucket at the end of it.
[02:57:50.110 --> 02:57:51.910]  You put your dab in the bucket part.
[02:57:52.870 --> 02:57:54.510]  Guys, there's a company that's selling those
[02:57:54.510 --> 02:57:56.390]  that's claiming they're quartz and they're glass.
[02:57:56.390 --> 02:57:57.230]  Be careful.
[02:57:57.230 --> 02:57:59.390]  You don't want to buy glass and reheat it and let it cool
[02:57:59.390 --> 02:58:00.230]  and reheat it and let it cool.
[02:58:00.230 --> 02:58:01.050]  It's going to break.
[02:58:01.050 --> 02:58:01.890]  You want a good quartz piece.
[02:58:01.890 --> 02:58:03.230]  Quartz can handle the shit.
[02:58:04.390 --> 02:58:05.670]  Also, we go back to that stuff,
[02:58:05.670 --> 02:58:08.430]  talking about what's made in America, what's made in China.
[02:58:08.430 --> 02:58:10.950]  Try to do that with your quartz products also.
[02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:13.390]  Get a Halen Honey Hole, get a real Quave Banger,
[02:58:13.390 --> 02:58:16.350]  or get yourself a real highly educated titanium nail.
[02:58:16.350 --> 02:58:19.390]  Those are the only nails I will support on this show.
[02:58:19.390 --> 02:58:21.510]  So come on guys, send me some nails.
[02:58:21.510 --> 02:58:22.350]  Not really, I'm just kidding.
[02:58:22.350 --> 02:58:24.790]  I've got all the nails I can use right now.
[02:58:24.790 --> 02:58:26.210]  So good nail is key.
[02:58:26.210 --> 02:58:27.390]  That's the point here.
[02:58:27.390 --> 02:58:28.990]  Also, recently I discovered something
[02:58:28.990 --> 02:58:31.470]  that the people in Colorado may be excited about.
[02:58:31.470 --> 02:58:35.890]  Occasionally, Kind Love in Denver has occasionally
[02:58:35.890 --> 02:58:39.050]  been putting out clones of my Lemon Jeffrey.
[02:58:39.050 --> 02:58:42.110]  They actually bought seeds from me at an event.
[02:58:42.110 --> 02:58:43.750]  They bought several packages of seeds
[02:58:43.750 --> 02:58:45.150]  and they ran the Lemon Jeffrey
[02:58:45.150 --> 02:58:47.390]  and they found their phenotypes that are killer.
[02:58:47.390 --> 02:58:49.270]  I've seen the lab tests.
[02:58:49.270 --> 02:58:51.990]  They've tested from the 24 to 26s
[02:58:52.630 --> 02:58:53.550]  and they actually said that they could have grown
[02:58:53.550 --> 02:58:55.030]  the herb better, but there was an issue.
[02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:58.350]  So that means that next time you're going to see 28 to 29%
[02:58:58.350 --> 02:59:00.430]  on the Lemon Jeffrey from Kind Love.
[02:59:00.430 --> 02:59:03.470]  So occasionally you can pick up Lemon Jeffrey clones
[02:59:03.470 --> 02:59:04.990]  at Kind Love and they are beautiful.
[02:59:04.990 --> 02:59:05.870]  I've seen pictures of them.
[02:59:05.870 --> 02:59:08.130]  They're big, fat, healthy, luscious clones.
[02:59:08.130 --> 02:59:09.430]  I definitely recommend that.
[02:59:09.430 --> 02:59:11.310]  Call before you drive.
[02:59:11.310 --> 02:59:12.790]  They will not reserve a clone for you.
[02:59:12.790 --> 02:59:14.150]  So you have to call, you have to say,
[02:59:14.150 --> 02:59:15.190]  do they have this clone?
[02:59:15.190 --> 02:59:16.870]  And if they say yes, then you got to get in the car
[02:59:16.870 --> 02:59:17.990]  and haul ass over there
[02:59:17.990 --> 02:59:19.590]  because they will not reserve a clone for you,
[02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:20.750]  but they might have it.
[02:59:22.470 --> 02:59:24.910]  All right, I feel like I'm talking a million miles an hour.
[02:59:24.910 --> 02:59:26.550]  I'm going to press pause, take a dab,
[02:59:26.550 --> 02:59:28.870]  and then we're going to get into some news.
[02:59:28.870 --> 02:59:30.270]  I'll be right back guys.
[02:59:30.270 --> 02:59:32.270]  The organic portions of this episode were sponsored
[02:59:32.270 --> 02:59:34.030]  by my friends at the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[02:59:34.030 --> 02:59:36.150]  Visit the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in Colorado Springs
[02:59:36.150 --> 02:59:38.150]  for fresh worm castings, African night crawlers,
[02:59:38.150 --> 02:59:40.550]  red wigglers, and all of your soil amendments.
[02:59:40.550 --> 02:59:42.710]  Rocky Mountain Worm Company has Dragonfly Earth Medicine
[02:59:42.710 --> 02:59:44.470]  products in stock right now.
[02:59:44.470 --> 02:59:46.750]  The Rocky Mountain Worm Company will ship to your door.
[02:59:46.750 --> 02:59:48.910]  You can get the same worm castings that I use,
[02:59:48.910 --> 02:59:51.230]  plus many of the same amendments I use in my garden
[02:59:51.270 --> 02:59:53.510]  through RockyMountainWormCompany.com.
[02:59:53.510 --> 02:59:54.550]  Check that out today.
[02:59:57.390 --> 02:59:58.230]  All right guys, I'm back.
[02:59:58.230 --> 02:59:59.950]  I want to give a huge shout out to Taskin Linus.
[02:59:59.950 --> 03:00:02.230]  Thanks for letting me use the music on the show guys.
[03:00:02.230 --> 03:00:04.230]  So I want to talk about some news, like I said,
[03:00:04.230 --> 03:00:05.670]  but to lead into the news,
[03:00:05.670 --> 03:00:08.230]  I want to talk a little bit about a comedy show
[03:00:08.230 --> 03:00:09.730]  that I went to recently.
[03:00:09.730 --> 03:00:12.070]  Clint and I were bragging that we got to go see
[03:00:12.070 --> 03:00:13.990]  the taping of Doug Loves Movies,
[03:00:13.990 --> 03:00:16.830]  which is one of my favorite podcasts.
[03:00:16.830 --> 03:00:18.390]  Doug Benson is a weed comedian.
[03:00:18.390 --> 03:00:20.030]  He does a show called Doug Loves Movies
[03:00:20.030 --> 03:00:21.790]  where they play games.
[03:00:21.790 --> 03:00:25.070]  He usually brings three comedians
[03:00:25.070 --> 03:00:27.410]  or some level of superstars to the show with him
[03:00:27.410 --> 03:00:30.630]  and they are his contestants and they play for the audience
[03:00:30.630 --> 03:00:32.030]  and the audience will win the prizes
[03:00:32.030 --> 03:00:34.230]  based on who wins in the crowd.
[03:00:34.230 --> 03:00:36.870]  So Doug Loves Movies came to Comedy Works
[03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:37.750]  in downtown Denver.
[03:00:37.750 --> 03:00:39.350]  You guys know how much I love Comedy Works.
[03:00:39.350 --> 03:00:40.710]  Big shout out to Baker.
[03:00:40.710 --> 03:00:41.710]  Big shout out to Comedy Works.
[03:00:41.710 --> 03:00:43.670]  Big shout out to the entire crew there.
[03:00:44.750 --> 03:00:45.870]  Excuse me for that giant cough.
[03:00:45.870 --> 03:00:47.330]  I felt that coming.
[03:00:47.330 --> 03:00:50.330]  So Clint and I, actually shout out to Clint.
[03:00:50.330 --> 03:00:52.050]  Clint drove me up there because like I said,
[03:00:52.050 --> 03:00:53.450]  my transmission is fucked.
[03:00:53.450 --> 03:00:56.690]  So Clint drove us up there and got us to the Mellow Mushroom.
[03:00:56.690 --> 03:00:57.530]  Shout out to the mushroom.
[03:00:57.530 --> 03:00:59.170]  They always feed us well.
[03:00:59.170 --> 03:01:00.210]  Got us to Comedy Works.
[03:01:00.210 --> 03:01:01.370]  We got to see the show.
[03:01:02.890 --> 03:01:06.350]  We talked about Doug's last show not being up to standards.
[03:01:06.350 --> 03:01:08.650]  This time we laughed our asses off.
[03:01:08.650 --> 03:01:11.770]  He completely, completely made up for the lack of funny
[03:01:11.770 --> 03:01:12.670]  in the last show.
[03:01:13.690 --> 03:01:15.250]  So I'm catching my breath after that cough.
[03:01:15.250 --> 03:01:16.090]  I apologize.
[03:01:17.690 --> 03:01:19.890]  I took some pretty gnarly dabs
[03:01:19.890 --> 03:01:21.530]  while we were off the air there.
[03:01:21.530 --> 03:01:23.290]  Oh yeah, while you guys were listening to that commercial
[03:01:23.290 --> 03:01:24.130]  about the Worm Company.
[03:01:24.130 --> 03:01:24.970]  Thanks for that.
[03:01:25.890 --> 03:01:27.330]  All right, I really am going to read this article here.
[03:01:27.330 --> 03:01:30.370]  I'm just trying to catch my breath before I do it, you guys.
[03:01:30.370 --> 03:01:33.370]  Doug Benson, he pulled off a great show, a great podcast.
[03:01:33.370 --> 03:01:35.090]  You can listen to the exact episode.
[03:01:35.090 --> 03:01:37.690]  If you go to iTunes, search for Doug Benson,
[03:01:37.690 --> 03:01:39.250]  it's Doug Loves Movies.
[03:01:39.250 --> 03:01:41.930]  The episode actually is titled something about,
[03:01:41.930 --> 03:01:42.890]  I'm going to look at my phone right here
[03:01:42.890 --> 03:01:45.530]  just so that I can tell you accurately what it is.
[03:01:45.530 --> 03:01:46.490]  We're going there.
[03:01:46.490 --> 03:01:48.410]  I've got this iPhone, takes a second.
[03:01:48.410 --> 03:01:51.570]  It is, holy crap, he does a lot of episodes, bro.
[03:01:51.570 --> 03:01:53.610]  It's titled Jeff Tate, Julian McCullough
[03:01:53.610 --> 03:01:55.610]  and Ricardo Baca Guest.
[03:01:55.610 --> 03:01:57.690]  And it was put up on Monday.
[03:01:57.690 --> 03:01:59.290]  So check that out if you want to, you guys.
[03:01:59.290 --> 03:02:00.610]  I was sitting in the front row.
[03:02:00.610 --> 03:02:02.610]  Shout out to my friends at Comedy Works.
[03:02:04.290 --> 03:02:05.770]  I owe somebody an apology.
[03:02:05.770 --> 03:02:07.090]  Wow, I got to fix that sound equipment.
[03:02:07.090 --> 03:02:08.090]  I got this shit spiked up.
[03:02:08.090 --> 03:02:11.330]  I owe somebody an apology at Comedy Works, a patron.
[03:02:11.330 --> 03:02:16.330]  I was gifted the luxury of being able to
[03:02:16.650 --> 03:02:18.650]  get the luxury of kind of a lifetime VIP pass
[03:02:18.650 --> 03:02:19.490]  for Comedy Works.
[03:02:19.490 --> 03:02:21.890]  A VIP pass for Comedy Works.
[03:02:21.890 --> 03:02:23.650]  As long as I call ahead and let my friend know
[03:02:23.650 --> 03:02:28.090]  that I'm coming, I can get a VIP seat in the front row,
[03:02:28.090 --> 03:02:29.410]  let them know how many of us there will be
[03:02:29.410 --> 03:02:30.330]  and they'll put me in the front row
[03:02:30.330 --> 03:02:32.050]  as long as I've got tickets.
[03:02:32.050 --> 03:02:32.970]  So I called ahead.
[03:02:32.970 --> 03:02:35.890]  I made arrangements to have my front row privileges.
[03:02:35.890 --> 03:02:37.570]  I was told that's cool.
[03:02:37.570 --> 03:02:41.490]  We got to the club and when it was time to seat us,
[03:02:41.490 --> 03:02:43.650]  the seating people kind of looked at each other
[03:02:43.650 --> 03:02:45.290]  with some concern.
[03:02:45.290 --> 03:02:47.770]  And the one guy said, you fucked up, you go tell him.
[03:02:47.770 --> 03:02:50.490]  So the one seating person, I don't know what he's called.
[03:02:50.490 --> 03:02:51.330]  I'm going to call him an usher.
[03:02:51.330 --> 03:02:52.210]  That sounds about right.
[03:02:52.210 --> 03:02:54.970]  But the one usher dude had to go tell two people
[03:02:54.970 --> 03:02:57.050]  that they had to move because the seats
[03:02:57.050 --> 03:02:58.890]  that they were sitting in up front
[03:02:58.890 --> 03:03:02.030]  had been reserved for Doug's VIP special guests.
[03:03:03.310 --> 03:03:05.330]  I felt bad for that because those people
[03:03:05.330 --> 03:03:07.330]  probably waited in line for a good hour
[03:03:07.330 --> 03:03:09.650]  while I was at the Mellow Mushroom eating pizza
[03:03:09.650 --> 03:03:11.630]  or in the car taking fat dabs.
[03:03:13.090 --> 03:03:13.930]  While I'm thinking about it,
[03:03:13.930 --> 03:03:15.050]  shout out to Claude the Candy Man.
[03:03:15.790 --> 03:03:17.250]  I ate a Sweet Stone candy, a Claudie Bear,
[03:03:17.250 --> 03:03:18.250]  before I went into the show,
[03:03:18.250 --> 03:03:19.490]  about two hours before the show.
[03:03:19.490 --> 03:03:23.830]  And by showtime, woohoo, I was Sweet Stoned for sure.
[03:03:23.830 --> 03:03:26.630]  So they had to go and move these two people
[03:03:26.630 --> 03:03:28.970]  because I've got this VIP pass.
[03:03:28.970 --> 03:03:32.330]  So they sit, Clint and I, in the most prime fucking seats
[03:03:32.330 --> 03:03:34.010]  in the club right up front.
[03:03:34.010 --> 03:03:34.850]  And it's kind of awkward.
[03:03:34.850 --> 03:03:35.930]  I could feel hatred.
[03:03:35.930 --> 03:03:38.610]  People were staring at us like we were huge dicks.
[03:03:39.730 --> 03:03:41.370]  And then eventually the guy sitting next to us
[03:03:41.370 --> 03:03:42.850]  got tired of the tension and he just said,
[03:03:42.850 --> 03:03:44.570]  so who the fuck are you guys?
[03:03:45.090 --> 03:03:46.810]  And Clint said, nobody, I'm with him.
[03:03:46.810 --> 03:03:47.770]  And they're like, who are you?
[03:03:47.770 --> 03:03:49.370]  And I was like, we're just friends of Doug's.
[03:03:49.370 --> 03:03:50.730]  And they said, yeah, they moved our friends
[03:03:50.730 --> 03:03:53.610]  because you guys are Doug's special guests.
[03:03:53.610 --> 03:03:55.570]  And I felt kind of like a shithead for that.
[03:03:55.570 --> 03:03:58.970]  So I do apologize, but I had a great ass time up front.
[03:03:58.970 --> 03:04:00.530]  That was a good ass show.
[03:04:00.530 --> 03:04:01.770]  Let's go and read this article.
[03:04:01.770 --> 03:04:03.450]  I've been talking for a long time about it
[03:04:03.450 --> 03:04:06.090]  and I've just got an article written.
[03:04:06.090 --> 03:04:08.850]  I was excited because what Doug does,
[03:04:08.850 --> 03:04:10.650]  dude, excuse all the coughing and throat clearing.
[03:04:10.650 --> 03:04:13.930]  I just took some gnarly dabs of some Gorilla Glue.
[03:04:13.930 --> 03:04:15.810]  Hopefully that was the last one of those.
[03:04:15.810 --> 03:04:17.570]  Not the dab, the throat clearing.
[03:04:18.530 --> 03:04:20.690]  I was excited because when he announced his guests,
[03:04:20.690 --> 03:04:23.730]  he said Ricardo Baca and I knew who that was right away.
[03:04:23.730 --> 03:04:25.370]  And a lot of our news on this show
[03:04:25.370 --> 03:04:27.230]  is written by Ricardo Baca.
[03:04:27.230 --> 03:04:29.330]  So this says, Comedia Podcast,
[03:04:29.330 --> 03:04:32.730]  listen to marijuana editor Ricardo Baca on Doug Loves Movies.
[03:04:32.730 --> 03:04:34.610]  Comedians Jeff Tate and Julian McCullough
[03:04:34.610 --> 03:04:36.290]  join weed editor Ricardo Baca
[03:04:36.290 --> 03:04:39.170]  on Doug Benson's popular movie podcast.
[03:04:39.170 --> 03:04:40.490]  Of course, this came out May 11th
[03:04:40.490 --> 03:04:42.210]  and it was in the Cannabis.
[03:04:42.250 --> 03:04:44.530]  It's written by Ricardo Baca.
[03:04:44.530 --> 03:04:46.730]  It says, talk about nerves.
[03:04:46.730 --> 03:04:49.330]  As 4.20 PM Denver time approached on May 10th,
[03:04:49.330 --> 03:04:50.730]  AKA Mother's Day,
[03:04:50.730 --> 03:04:53.490]  I was sitting in Comedy Works green room
[03:04:53.490 --> 03:04:55.610]  with some insanely talented standup comics
[03:04:55.610 --> 03:04:57.010]  getting ready to take the stage
[03:04:57.010 --> 03:05:00.690]  for a taping of my single favorite podcast in the world.
[03:05:00.690 --> 03:05:03.570]  Comic Doug Benson, also a legit weed hero,
[03:05:03.570 --> 03:05:05.890]  had generously asked me to be a guest
[03:05:05.890 --> 03:05:08.410]  on his movie podcast, Doug Loves Movies,
[03:05:08.410 --> 03:05:10.610]  after seeing the marijuana journalism documentary,
[03:05:10.610 --> 03:05:13.930]  Rolling Papers, at the South by Southwest Film Festival.
[03:05:13.930 --> 03:05:15.050]  Too fun.
[03:05:15.050 --> 03:05:16.410]  I'm gonna jump in right here.
[03:05:16.410 --> 03:05:18.790]  I mentioned Rolling Papers, a movie.
[03:05:18.790 --> 03:05:22.090]  A camera crew followed, what's his name,
[03:05:22.090 --> 03:05:24.470]  Ricardo Baca around for a year
[03:05:24.470 --> 03:05:27.050]  and followed members of his staff and part of the newspaper.
[03:05:27.050 --> 03:05:29.490]  They followed him for an entire year and recorded
[03:05:29.490 --> 03:05:33.490]  and made a documentary about the journalism,
[03:05:33.490 --> 03:05:36.250]  marijuana journalism that is developed in Colorado.
[03:05:36.250 --> 03:05:39.090]  And they've dubbed the movie Rolling Papers.
[03:05:39.090 --> 03:05:41.730]  It was purchased after its first showing
[03:05:41.730 --> 03:05:43.490]  at the South by Southwest Festival.
[03:05:43.490 --> 03:05:45.310]  So that's coming out in the future.
[03:05:45.310 --> 03:05:47.510]  I'll keep you guys updated when that comes out.
[03:05:48.730 --> 03:05:49.650]  Excuse all the coughing.
[03:05:49.650 --> 03:05:51.330]  I apologize, it's a weed show.
[03:05:51.330 --> 03:05:52.370]  You get it.
[03:05:52.370 --> 03:05:54.210]  I hope you're coughing with me.
[03:05:54.210 --> 03:05:55.250]  Then the article goes on to say,
[03:05:55.250 --> 03:05:56.490]  and then the nerves came on.
[03:05:56.490 --> 03:05:59.050]  Lots of people listen to this, I thought.
[03:05:59.050 --> 03:06:01.130]  But after meeting my fellow guests,
[03:06:01.130 --> 03:06:03.850]  Whipsmart comedians, Jeff Tate and Julian McCullough,
[03:06:03.850 --> 03:06:07.090]  and seeing Benson again, I knew we were in for a good time.
[03:06:07.090 --> 03:06:08.690]  The podcast taping was a blast.
[03:06:09.330 --> 03:06:11.610]  The sold out crowd at Comedy Works was super rad
[03:06:11.610 --> 03:06:14.450]  and Benson's team took less than 24 hours to launch it.
[03:06:14.450 --> 03:06:15.850]  And he means the podcast.
[03:06:15.850 --> 03:06:18.730]  And now everyone can listen via the embedded
[03:06:18.730 --> 03:06:20.890]  Doug Loves Movies site or iTunes.
[03:06:20.890 --> 03:06:23.290]  So yeah, if you go to douglovesmovies.com
[03:06:23.290 --> 03:06:25.090]  or go to iTunes, you can listen to it.
[03:06:25.090 --> 03:06:26.870]  It was a great, great podcast.
[03:06:28.650 --> 03:06:30.650]  Ricardo Baca did quite damn well.
[03:06:30.650 --> 03:06:35.650]  He was on stage with three witty top level comedians
[03:06:35.690 --> 03:06:36.770]  and he held his own.
[03:06:36.770 --> 03:06:39.370]  He did not try to step up and be a comedian.
[03:06:39.370 --> 03:06:42.090]  He remained Ricardo Baca and I respected him for that.
[03:06:42.090 --> 03:06:44.850]  He let the comedians comedy and he did his job
[03:06:44.850 --> 03:06:46.810]  and was the person that they invited.
[03:06:46.810 --> 03:06:48.110]  You guys, my throat is tickly.
[03:06:48.110 --> 03:06:49.290]  I'm gonna press pause for a second
[03:06:49.290 --> 03:06:50.770]  and I'll be right back with another news article.
[03:06:50.770 --> 03:06:52.270]  Excuse me and I apologize.
[03:06:53.330 --> 03:06:55.450]  Oh my gosh, you guys wouldn't believe what I just spit up.
[03:06:55.450 --> 03:06:57.050]  I should have took a picture of that for you.
[03:06:57.050 --> 03:06:58.850]  Man, I should have recorded the sound of that
[03:06:58.850 --> 03:07:00.810]  hitting wherever it landed.
[03:07:00.810 --> 03:07:01.750]  Oh, that was thick.
[03:07:02.890 --> 03:07:04.370]  Here's a side note on the cannabis.
[03:07:04.370 --> 03:07:06.410]  The strain of the day is golden goat.
[03:07:07.090 --> 03:07:09.370]  People often credit me for making the golden goat.
[03:07:09.370 --> 03:07:10.930]  I did not invent the golden goat.
[03:07:10.930 --> 03:07:14.570]  I simply put it into FeminiSeed for the world to enjoy.
[03:07:14.570 --> 03:07:17.510]  Golden goat was created by Mr. Dank in Topeka, Kansas.
[03:07:18.610 --> 03:07:20.370]  Shout out Mr. Dank.
[03:07:20.370 --> 03:07:21.290]  Oh, I'm catching my breath.
[03:07:21.290 --> 03:07:23.650]  I'm sure you can hear that a little bit,
[03:07:23.650 --> 03:07:25.370]  but we are gonna read another news article.
[03:07:25.370 --> 03:07:26.450]  I'm gonna fix some recording equipment.
[03:07:26.450 --> 03:07:28.570]  I'm blowing some shit up.
[03:07:28.570 --> 03:07:29.770]  I've got the air conditioner next to me
[03:07:29.770 --> 03:07:31.090]  and I don't think you guys can hear it,
[03:07:31.090 --> 03:07:33.250]  but the recording equipment is struggling
[03:07:33.250 --> 03:07:35.250]  to keep me in this fucking air conditioner
[03:07:35.250 --> 03:07:36.190]  separate in the recording here.
[03:07:36.970 --> 03:07:38.390]  It's pretty neat watching the lights light up.
[03:07:38.390 --> 03:07:40.750]  Anyway, this one hits close to home
[03:07:40.750 --> 03:07:43.150]  because I do live in Pueblo, Colorado.
[03:07:43.150 --> 03:07:46.550]  I am actually the grower at a very popular dispensary
[03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:48.670]  in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[03:07:48.670 --> 03:07:51.790]  Pueblo West is like a sub development
[03:07:51.790 --> 03:07:53.390]  just outside of the city of Pueblo.
[03:07:53.390 --> 03:07:55.270]  It's about 10 minutes to the west, obviously.
[03:07:55.270 --> 03:07:56.590]  It's Pueblo West.
[03:07:56.590 --> 03:07:58.430]  It's a little nicer.
[03:07:58.430 --> 03:08:01.230]  I don't know that it's exactly completely a little nicer.
[03:08:01.230 --> 03:08:04.230]  It's newer, so it doesn't have old town problems.
[03:08:04.230 --> 03:08:05.750]  It doesn't have the old rickety parts of town,
[03:08:06.310 --> 03:08:07.350]  so it looks a lot nicer.
[03:08:08.590 --> 03:08:10.330]  We also have a part that we call the county,
[03:08:10.330 --> 03:08:12.090]  which if you drive outside of city limits,
[03:08:12.090 --> 03:08:15.750]  there are a lot of stores and shopping areas in the county.
[03:08:15.750 --> 03:08:17.470]  And the county and Pueblo West
[03:08:17.470 --> 03:08:19.030]  are allowed to have dispensaries,
[03:08:19.030 --> 03:08:24.030]  but the city of Pueblo has not been allowed dispensaries.
[03:08:24.470 --> 03:08:27.030]  I'm going to read an article that came out May 12th.
[03:08:28.150 --> 03:08:30.150]  Dude, I really do apologize for this throat.
[03:08:30.150 --> 03:08:31.350]  I just took some gnarly dabs.
[03:08:31.350 --> 03:08:32.830]  I'll quit taking so many dabs on the show
[03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:34.470]  so that you guys can hear me.
[03:08:34.470 --> 03:08:36.590]  Also, come be on the show, talk to me,
[03:08:36.590 --> 03:08:37.870]  talk while I'm clearing my throat
[03:08:37.870 --> 03:08:39.670]  and you guys can give me a break.
[03:08:39.670 --> 03:08:41.370]  This article says, Pueblo Pot Shops,
[03:08:41.370 --> 03:08:42.790]  voters will decide whether to allow
[03:08:42.790 --> 03:08:44.910]  retail sales in November.
[03:08:44.910 --> 03:08:47.550]  It's only by the APs who gets credit for this.
[03:08:47.550 --> 03:08:51.030]  Pueblo lawmakers are letting the voters decide
[03:08:51.030 --> 03:08:53.190]  whether to allow recreational marijuana shops
[03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:54.390]  in their city.
[03:08:54.390 --> 03:08:56.510]  The Pueblo Chieftain reports concerned residents
[03:08:56.510 --> 03:08:58.750]  filled the city council chambers Monday night,
[03:08:58.750 --> 03:09:01.310]  many wearing yellow shirts that said, voice your choice
[03:09:01.310 --> 03:09:03.070]  and urging their elected officials
[03:09:03.070 --> 03:09:04.710]  to put the issue to voters.
[03:09:05.950 --> 03:09:08.290]  Councilman Bob Schilling was the only vote in favor
[03:09:08.290 --> 03:09:10.210]  of licensing retail pot shops,
[03:09:10.210 --> 03:09:13.230]  but said that he hasn't opposed a vote in November.
[03:09:13.230 --> 03:09:15.070]  Several of the six council members who voted
[03:09:15.070 --> 03:09:17.230]  against adopting the ordinance had been in favor
[03:09:17.230 --> 03:09:20.390]  before the public hearing, including President Stephen Araki.
[03:09:20.390 --> 03:09:22.070]  Excuse me guys, I'm sorry.
[03:09:22.070 --> 03:09:26.710]  He said, the issue isn't worth dividing the public over.
[03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:30.790]  They did vote and they did decide to push back the vote.
[03:09:30.790 --> 03:09:34.710]  There will be no recreational or medical marijuana shops
[03:09:34.710 --> 03:09:38.090]  in the city of Pueblo until they vote again,
[03:09:38.950 --> 03:09:40.430]  which will be in November.
[03:09:40.430 --> 03:09:42.470]  So you guys, if you live in Pueblo,
[03:09:42.470 --> 03:09:44.710]  you have to drive 15 minutes to the county
[03:09:44.710 --> 03:09:47.590]  or to Pueblo West to go purchase your cannabis
[03:09:47.590 --> 03:09:49.310]  and then drive back.
[03:09:49.310 --> 03:09:50.830]  And then the city that you live in
[03:09:50.830 --> 03:09:52.810]  isn't getting your tax money for the cannabis
[03:09:52.810 --> 03:09:54.850]  that you're able to purchase
[03:09:54.850 --> 03:09:56.890]  because of these stupid fucking regulations
[03:09:56.890 --> 03:09:58.630]  that Pueblo has been juggling with.
[03:09:59.470 --> 03:10:02.190]  I've been in the legal medical marijuana industry
[03:10:02.190 --> 03:10:05.890]  in this city since, we had the first shop,
[03:10:05.890 --> 03:10:07.150]  I think that was nine years ago
[03:10:07.150 --> 03:10:09.430]  when we had Medimar downtown.
[03:10:09.430 --> 03:10:11.110]  And since that is closed,
[03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:12.810]  there has not been another medical shop
[03:10:12.810 --> 03:10:14.350]  or a recreational shop in the city
[03:10:14.350 --> 03:10:15.430]  that was legally licensed.
[03:10:15.430 --> 03:10:16.910]  There've been places that popped up randomly
[03:10:16.910 --> 03:10:20.390]  and were closed, but I think it's kind of retarded.
[03:10:20.390 --> 03:10:21.830]  I shouldn't use the word retarded.
[03:10:21.830 --> 03:10:23.150]  That's mean to the retarded people.
[03:10:23.150 --> 03:10:24.750]  I think it's ridiculous and stupid
[03:10:24.750 --> 03:10:27.790]  that we are not allowed to have a recreational cannabis shop
[03:10:27.790 --> 03:10:29.090]  within city limits.
[03:10:30.190 --> 03:10:31.190]  They need the tax money.
[03:10:31.190 --> 03:10:33.350]  This town is broke and hurting.
[03:10:33.350 --> 03:10:36.390]  Bunch of weed money would really help this city.
[03:10:36.390 --> 03:10:38.150]  All right, here's another news article
[03:10:38.150 --> 03:10:39.310]  that I found interesting.
[03:10:39.310 --> 03:10:41.310]  It says, Castle Rock Man pleads guilty
[03:10:41.310 --> 03:10:43.870]  to mailing Colorado pot across the country.
[03:10:43.870 --> 03:10:46.290]  This one is written by Anthony Cotton of the Denver Post.
[03:10:46.290 --> 03:10:48.590]  It was published May 12th.
[03:10:48.590 --> 03:10:51.310]  And here's, you're gonna catch on right away
[03:10:51.310 --> 03:10:52.650]  my point when I start reading this.
[03:10:52.650 --> 03:10:55.630]  It says, a Castle Rock Man pleaded guilty on charges
[03:10:55.630 --> 03:10:57.670]  that included sending more than a hundred packages
[03:10:58.510 --> 03:11:00.670]  that included marijuana to locations across the country
[03:11:00.670 --> 03:11:03.310]  and receiving several hundred thousand dollars
[03:11:03.310 --> 03:11:04.830]  through the mail in return.
[03:11:06.670 --> 03:11:09.430]  According to the United States District Attorney's Office,
[03:11:09.430 --> 03:11:11.830]  Brian Daniel Evans, age 42,
[03:11:11.830 --> 03:11:14.550]  began mailing pot packages in April of 2014
[03:11:14.550 --> 03:11:16.950]  and continued through that fall.
[03:11:16.950 --> 03:11:18.870]  Evans pleaded guilty this April.
[03:11:18.870 --> 03:11:21.070]  Officials said Evans first came under suspicion
[03:11:21.070 --> 03:11:24.070]  on April 2nd, 2014, when a US Postal Inspector
[03:11:24.070 --> 03:11:25.830]  came across a suspicious mailing
[03:11:25.830 --> 03:11:28.710]  that may have contained narcotics or narcotic proceeds.
[03:11:28.710 --> 03:11:30.670]  The first package in question came from Missouri
[03:11:30.670 --> 03:11:32.110]  and it contained cash.
[03:11:33.030 --> 03:11:33.950]  That package was sent
[03:11:33.950 --> 03:11:36.290]  to a commercial mail receiving agency mailbox
[03:11:36.290 --> 03:11:39.510]  and was addressed to an individual in Lone Tree.
[03:11:39.510 --> 03:11:41.430]  An ongoing investigation traced the car
[03:11:41.430 --> 03:11:42.990]  under surveillance to Evans,
[03:11:42.990 --> 03:11:44.550]  who was also seen mailing parcels
[03:11:44.550 --> 03:11:46.970]  from post offices in the Metro area.
[03:11:46.970 --> 03:11:49.450]  Officials said inspectors also conducted search,
[03:11:49.450 --> 03:11:51.310]  a search of Elvin's apartment
[03:11:51.310 --> 03:11:55.110]  that that search recovered 580 grams of bagged marijuana,
[03:11:55.110 --> 03:11:58.030]  800 grams of marijuana extract or hash oil.
[03:11:58.030 --> 03:11:59.510]  Wow, that's a lot of hash oil, bro.
[03:11:59.510 --> 03:12:00.870]  That's close to two pounds.
[03:12:02.830 --> 03:12:05.870]  5,480 grams of marijuana edibles
[03:12:05.870 --> 03:12:10.150]  for a total weight of 6,860 grams of marijuana.
[03:12:10.150 --> 03:12:11.330]  Wait a minute.
[03:12:11.330 --> 03:12:13.470]  You guys heard that stupid shit in there, right?
[03:12:13.470 --> 03:12:16.630]  5,480 grams of marijuana edibles.
[03:12:16.630 --> 03:12:18.430]  They're fucking weighing the brownies
[03:12:18.430 --> 03:12:21.030]  and charging him with the weight of the fucking brownies
[03:12:21.030 --> 03:12:22.390]  for the grams of pot.
[03:12:23.310 --> 03:12:24.910]  That's fucking whack, bro.
[03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:26.510]  That is inaccurate.
[03:12:26.510 --> 03:12:27.330]  That's not cool.
[03:12:27.330 --> 03:12:29.190]  That's like weighing the baggy too.
[03:12:29.190 --> 03:12:30.630]  You can't do that, man.
[03:12:30.630 --> 03:12:32.470]  You're a shitty drug dealer.
[03:12:32.470 --> 03:12:33.790]  That sucks.
[03:12:33.790 --> 03:12:35.030]  This whole article is fucked up.
[03:12:35.030 --> 03:12:36.150]  This guy should not have done that,
[03:12:36.150 --> 03:12:38.470]  but that part right there is wrong.
[03:12:38.470 --> 03:12:39.870]  I'm gonna continue the article.
[03:12:39.870 --> 03:12:42.450]  A search of his vehicle found an additional 78 grams
[03:12:42.450 --> 03:12:43.550]  of liquid marijuana.
[03:12:43.550 --> 03:12:45.710]  He probably had some tincture, you guys.
[03:12:45.710 --> 03:12:47.790]  He had previously mailed two additional packages
[03:12:47.790 --> 03:12:49.230]  that were seized by law enforcement.
[03:12:49.230 --> 03:12:54.050]  Those packages contained 3,654 grams of marijuana.
[03:12:54.050 --> 03:12:55.810]  In total, inspectors learned that Elvin
[03:12:55.810 --> 03:12:59.490]  sent 11,026 grams of marijuana.
[03:12:59.490 --> 03:13:02.130]  Law enforcement also had seized during the investigation
[03:13:02.130 --> 03:13:06.330]  more than $53,000 in cash, which was the proceeds
[03:13:06.330 --> 03:13:08.690]  from his illegal narcotics transaction.
[03:13:08.690 --> 03:13:10.370]  That money was forfeited to the government
[03:13:10.370 --> 03:13:12.290]  as part of Elvin's plea agreement.
[03:13:12.290 --> 03:13:15.090]  Elvin's pled guilty to three counts of possession
[03:13:15.090 --> 03:13:17.530]  of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute.
[03:13:17.530 --> 03:13:21.450]  He now faces more than 20 years in federal prison
[03:13:21.450 --> 03:13:25.330]  and up to a $1 million fine per count.
[03:13:25.330 --> 03:13:28.990]  So my point here, people, is quit mailing weed
[03:13:28.990 --> 03:13:31.590]  out of Colorado, unless you wanna end up
[03:13:31.590 --> 03:13:34.090]  in federal prison doing 20 years
[03:13:34.090 --> 03:13:38.530]  and facing up to $1 million in fines per count.
[03:13:38.530 --> 03:13:40.230]  There are several reasons we shouldn't be mailing cannabis
[03:13:40.230 --> 03:13:42.330]  out of the state, you guys.
[03:13:42.330 --> 03:13:44.650]  First off, it's illegal and you're gonna go to prison
[03:13:44.650 --> 03:13:46.270]  and you're gonna get butt raped.
[03:13:46.270 --> 03:13:47.570]  Doesn't sound like fun to me.
[03:13:47.570 --> 03:13:49.490]  Doesn't sound like the fucking profit I'm making from it.
[03:13:49.490 --> 03:13:50.590]  Not at all.
[03:13:50.590 --> 03:13:53.970]  Second of all, in Colorado, the people that have fought
[03:13:53.970 --> 03:13:57.850]  hard to legalize cannabis medically and recreationally,
[03:13:57.850 --> 03:14:00.290]  we did it for here and you're fucking it up
[03:14:00.290 --> 03:14:01.690]  by mailing it somewhere else.
[03:14:01.690 --> 03:14:02.530]  It's their response.
[03:14:02.530 --> 03:14:04.650]  Wherever you're sending it, they're responsible
[03:14:04.650 --> 03:14:07.850]  for legalizing cannabis in their area, not us.
[03:14:07.850 --> 03:14:09.650]  And by sending it out, you're fucking up
[03:14:09.650 --> 03:14:11.150]  what we worked hard for.
[03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:12.290]  We're making something shiny.
[03:14:12.290 --> 03:14:13.650]  We've got a system that works.
[03:14:13.650 --> 03:14:16.530]  We've created laws and we're playing by the rules.
[03:14:16.530 --> 03:14:18.450]  And then you're gonna be a fucking shithead
[03:14:18.450 --> 03:14:20.210]  and take the rules that we've made.
[03:14:20.830 --> 03:14:22.110]  You can grow and smoke all the weed you want.
[03:14:22.110 --> 03:14:23.550]  You can hustle weed in Colorado.
[03:14:23.550 --> 03:14:24.710]  Quit sending it out of state.
[03:14:24.710 --> 03:14:25.710]  You don't need to do that.
[03:14:25.710 --> 03:14:28.230]  That's fucking it up, making everybody look bad
[03:14:28.230 --> 03:14:30.030]  and you're gonna get caught and get butt raped
[03:14:30.030 --> 03:14:31.150]  and go to jail.
[03:14:31.150 --> 03:14:33.150]  You get to be, I'll read about you in the future.
[03:14:33.150 --> 03:14:34.070]  Keep sending that shit.
[03:14:34.070 --> 03:14:37.230]  I will proudly read your name and laugh at you on this show.
[03:14:37.230 --> 03:14:39.030]  Don't send cannabis out of state.
[03:14:39.030 --> 03:14:40.070]  That's fucking my point.
[03:14:40.070 --> 03:14:41.710]  You guys get it, right?
[03:14:41.710 --> 03:14:43.630]  Legalize cannabis everywhere.
[03:14:43.630 --> 03:14:44.870]  Do your part.
[03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:46.310]  Contact your local Congress people.
[03:14:46.310 --> 03:14:47.350]  Go to city council meetings.
[03:14:47.350 --> 03:14:49.870]  Do that shit where you are and get it legalized
[03:14:50.450 --> 03:14:51.410]  in your area so that you don't have to get,
[03:14:51.410 --> 03:14:52.490]  there's not enough herb here.
[03:14:52.490 --> 03:14:53.410]  People are hurting for herb.
[03:14:53.410 --> 03:14:54.810]  There are patients that want cannabis
[03:14:54.810 --> 03:14:56.530]  that don't have any medicine here.
[03:14:56.530 --> 03:14:58.190]  And we're sending that shit to other states
[03:14:58.190 --> 03:14:59.290]  to make a profit.
[03:14:59.290 --> 03:15:00.290]  That's fucked up.
[03:15:00.290 --> 03:15:01.370]  Take the money out of cannabis.
[03:15:01.370 --> 03:15:02.770]  Put more compassion into cannabis.
[03:15:02.770 --> 03:15:03.970]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:15:03.970 --> 03:15:05.050]  All right.
[03:15:05.050 --> 03:15:05.890]  Yeah.
[03:15:05.890 --> 03:15:07.170]  What else do I have for you?
[03:15:07.170 --> 03:15:08.450]  We've gone 30 minutes.
[03:15:08.450 --> 03:15:09.930]  Let's just chat for a minute.
[03:15:09.930 --> 03:15:13.170]  I have promised you a scheduling episode.
[03:15:13.170 --> 03:15:14.730]  I told you I was gonna do an episode
[03:15:14.730 --> 03:15:18.490]  about scheduling your grow for a perpetual cycle.
[03:15:18.510 --> 03:15:20.190]  I am writing it, but I'm having an,
[03:15:20.190 --> 03:15:21.030]  I had an issue.
[03:15:21.030 --> 03:15:22.030]  I had a stumbling block.
[03:15:22.030 --> 03:15:23.710]  I don't know how many lights you have.
[03:15:23.710 --> 03:15:25.750]  So I don't know how to write a perpetual cycle
[03:15:25.750 --> 03:15:28.150]  for your room, but I have found a solution.
[03:15:28.150 --> 03:15:30.590]  So I'm writing it based on that.
[03:15:30.590 --> 03:15:32.150]  We'll get it together.
[03:15:32.150 --> 03:15:34.610]  That'll probably be one or two episodes away.
[03:15:36.730 --> 03:15:38.590]  The other episode I have been teasing
[03:15:38.590 --> 03:15:39.830]  about is improving your gardens.
[03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:42.150]  I was gonna say top 10 ways to improve your garden.
[03:15:42.150 --> 03:15:44.050]  I've got about 30 ways written down.
[03:15:44.050 --> 03:15:45.830]  That could be a long episode.
[03:15:45.830 --> 03:15:47.430]  That is definitely coming.
[03:15:49.230 --> 03:15:51.070]  I don't wanna talk too much about any of that stuff
[03:15:51.070 --> 03:15:52.650]  because we'll just save it for the actual show.
[03:15:52.650 --> 03:15:55.070]  I wanna give a huge shout out again to Clint and Baker.
[03:15:55.070 --> 03:15:57.410]  Also a big shout out to Comedy Works.
[03:15:57.410 --> 03:15:59.330]  Big shout out to everybody who has helped me deal
[03:15:59.330 --> 03:16:02.230]  with not having a car this week or this weekend.
[03:16:02.230 --> 03:16:03.470]  That's been a real pain in the ass.
[03:16:03.470 --> 03:16:05.270]  You guys, if we had some plans that I had to cancel
[03:16:05.270 --> 03:16:06.550]  or rearrange, I apologize.
[03:16:06.550 --> 03:16:08.510]  We've got a blown transmission.
[03:16:08.510 --> 03:16:10.270]  My chevrolet eggs will get me so far,
[03:16:10.270 --> 03:16:13.390]  but the weather has been shitty and I'm stuck.
[03:16:13.390 --> 03:16:14.790]  So you gotta come to me.
[03:16:14.790 --> 03:16:15.790]  If you wanna take some dabs
[03:16:15.790 --> 03:16:18.390]  or if you wanna be on the podcast, you gotta come to me.
[03:16:19.250 --> 03:16:20.090]  I'm gonna wrap up the show, you guys.
[03:16:20.090 --> 03:16:22.770]  You pay a lot more attention to a 35, 40 minute episode
[03:16:22.770 --> 03:16:24.250]  than you do those hour shows.
[03:16:24.250 --> 03:16:25.610]  Let me know what you think.
[03:16:26.750 --> 03:16:31.750]  Yeah, go to Stitcher or iTunes or Twitter or Facebook
[03:16:32.690 --> 03:16:35.050]  or email me and tell me if you prefer
[03:16:35.050 --> 03:16:37.950]  the 30 minute episodes over the hour long episodes.
[03:16:39.270 --> 03:16:41.910]  I think it's better when I do two 30 minute episodes
[03:16:41.910 --> 03:16:43.050]  instead of the long hour.
[03:16:43.050 --> 03:16:44.570]  And you guys really listen more.
[03:16:44.570 --> 03:16:45.850]  My throat doesn't fuck up as much.
[03:16:45.850 --> 03:16:47.650]  If we have a guest, we'll go an hour.
[03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:49.750]  When it's just me, I'm gonna try to go about 30
[03:16:49.750 --> 03:16:51.750]  and try to do two episodes a week.
[03:16:51.750 --> 03:16:53.710]  It's better for everybody that way, in my opinion.
[03:16:53.710 --> 03:16:55.110]  Let me know what you think.
[03:16:55.110 --> 03:16:58.150]  The show isn't just for me, the show is a lot for you.
[03:16:58.150 --> 03:16:59.790]  So thanks for listening, you guys.
[03:16:59.790 --> 03:17:00.690]  I'm gonna wrap it up.
[03:17:00.690 --> 03:17:02.550]  I'll be back in a few days with another episode,
[03:17:02.550 --> 03:17:04.710]  probably about ways to improve your garden.
[03:17:05.910 --> 03:17:07.270]  Don't forget to check out our sponsors,
[03:17:07.270 --> 03:17:08.750]  the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.

[03:17:31.890 --> 03:17:33.730]  Stitchery keeps changing the way the comments are handled,
[03:17:33.730 --> 03:17:36.690]  so leave a comment there and I will do my best to find it.
[03:17:36.690 --> 03:17:37.530]  If you have something to say
[03:17:37.530 --> 03:17:39.370]  and you're not into the social media thing,
[03:17:39.370 --> 03:17:40.810]  you can email me, like I said earlier,
[03:17:40.810 --> 03:17:42.410]  it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.

[03:17:46.030 --> 03:17:49.750]  or at rostagef420, that also works.
[03:17:49.750 --> 03:17:52.310]  Make sure you follow I read genetics on Instagram.
[03:17:52.310 --> 03:17:55.190]  We just hit 15,000 followers.
[03:17:55.190 --> 03:17:57.270]  Big up to everybody that follows us on Instagram.
[03:17:57.270 --> 03:17:59.190]  I appreciate that.
[03:17:59.190 --> 03:18:00.750]  Also, don't forget that the show is available
[03:18:00.750 --> 03:18:03.350]  on iTunes, Stitcher, and every single episode
[03:18:03.350 --> 03:18:08.230]  is forever archived on ireadgeneticscolorado.com.
[03:18:08.230 --> 03:18:10.450]  We did add that donation button on the podcast page.
[03:18:10.450 --> 03:18:12.230]  Guys, my transmission blew the fuck up.
[03:18:12.230 --> 03:18:15.310]  So to tell you the truth, as of what episode is this?
[03:18:15.330 --> 03:18:16.410]  This is number 70.
[03:18:17.410 --> 03:18:20.130]  That adventure that we were talking about for my daughter,
[03:18:20.130 --> 03:18:21.970]  the deadline for that was the first.
[03:18:21.970 --> 03:18:24.530]  So the new PayPal button,
[03:18:24.530 --> 03:18:26.830]  that goes to my transmission from here on out.
[03:18:28.010 --> 03:18:30.630]  Straight up honest about that bullshit.
[03:18:30.630 --> 03:18:31.810]  So yeah, go to the website.
[03:18:31.810 --> 03:18:33.690]  It's ireadgeneticscolorado.com.
[03:18:33.690 --> 03:18:35.370]  Click on the Grow From Your Heart podcast tab.
[03:18:35.370 --> 03:18:37.490]  At the top right, there's a little PayPal logo.
[03:18:37.490 --> 03:18:40.130]  Click on that, throw in a dollar, throw in $5,
[03:18:40.130 --> 03:18:41.550]  throw in $500.
[03:18:41.550 --> 03:18:43.490]  Transmission is $2,600.
[03:18:43.510 --> 03:18:45.990]  So we're working our way toward that.
[03:18:45.990 --> 03:18:46.830]  We'll get there.
[03:18:46.830 --> 03:18:48.150]  Don't worry, guys, I got it.
[03:18:48.150 --> 03:18:49.430]  I'll never charge you for this podcast.
[03:18:49.430 --> 03:18:50.450]  It's always gonna be free,
[03:18:50.450 --> 03:18:52.670]  but if you feel like making a contribution,
[03:18:52.670 --> 03:18:54.870]  saying thank you, that is definitely appreciated.
[03:18:54.870 --> 03:18:57.070]  I feel like I'm begging now, let's get away from this.
[03:18:57.070 --> 03:18:58.270]  We're on all the social media sites.
[03:18:58.270 --> 03:18:59.670]  I already said that.
[03:18:59.670 --> 03:19:00.790]  You guys, thanks for listening to me
[03:19:00.790 --> 03:19:02.430]  clear my throat a bunch of times.
[03:19:02.430 --> 03:19:04.530]  The next episode will be more educational.
[03:19:05.470 --> 03:19:07.190]  Yeah, shout out to my ninja Spence.
[03:19:07.190 --> 03:19:08.030]  Shout out to Maddie.
[03:19:08.030 --> 03:19:09.150]  Shout out to the Garden of Weden.
[03:19:09.150 --> 03:19:10.630]  Sloppy, big shout out, brother.
[03:19:10.630 --> 03:19:12.230]  I read about your medical issue
[03:19:12.230 --> 03:19:13.450]  and I need to visit with you.
[03:19:14.290 --> 03:19:15.130]  I don't have a car.
[03:19:15.130 --> 03:19:16.470]  We need to get together at Dab and Smoke, bro.
[03:19:16.470 --> 03:19:18.150]  I wanna talk to you about that.
[03:19:18.150 --> 03:19:19.190]  Big shout out to Sloppy.
[03:19:19.190 --> 03:19:20.190]  Love you, Sloppy.
[03:19:20.190 --> 03:19:21.150]  Love you like family.
[03:19:21.150 --> 03:19:23.350]  So until next time, you guys, take a fat dab
[03:19:23.350 --> 03:19:24.750]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[03:19:24.750 --> 03:19:25.590]  Get to it.
[03:19:25.590 --> 03:19:28.910]  What's up, what's up, what's up?
[03:19:28.910 --> 03:19:32.730]  Yeah, what's up, what's up, what's up?
[03:19:32.730 --> 03:19:33.810]  Come on, what's up?
[03:19:33.810 --> 03:19:36.010]  What's up, what's up, what's up?
[03:19:36.010 --> 03:19:57.960]  What's up, what's up?
[03:19:57.960 --> 03:19:59.320]  We're top notch female.
[03:19:59.320 --> 03:20:00.720]  Roll out the bed and click the button,
[03:20:00.720 --> 03:20:01.880]  checking my email.
[03:20:01.880 --> 03:20:05.760]  Well, we're related to Penn,
[03:20:05.760 --> 03:20:08.080]  extended fam from the Mystic Roots fam.
[03:20:08.080 --> 03:20:10.320]  And man, I gotta thank the Lord up above.
[03:20:10.940 --> 03:20:11.780]  These letters that I'm getting.
[03:20:11.780 --> 03:20:12.600]  They send a message of love.
[03:20:12.600 --> 03:20:13.780]  I connect with your music, dawg,
[03:20:13.780 --> 03:20:15.140]  it's been years I've known ya.
[03:20:15.140 --> 03:20:15.980]  What's it like to be cool
[03:20:15.980 --> 03:20:18.220]  from Mystic Roots up in California?
[03:20:18.220 --> 03:20:20.180]  What's it like living my life?
[03:20:20.180 --> 03:20:21.420]  Rocking mics every night,
[03:20:21.420 --> 03:20:23.340]  smoking purple and white, it's tight.
[03:20:23.340 --> 03:20:25.860]  I can't lie, I'm loving how I'm living since birth.
[03:20:25.860 --> 03:20:28.380]  I've been giving ambition plus the gift of spitting.
[03:20:28.380 --> 03:20:29.200]  Hot damn.
[03:20:29.200 --> 03:20:30.840]  All the way within my beat can't we stop now,
[03:20:30.840 --> 03:20:33.820]  see me on your plot now, got it on lock down.
[03:20:33.820 --> 03:20:36.420]  On lockdown like a penitentiary.
[03:20:36.420 --> 03:20:38.540]  Lord Cal, let my lifestyle survive.
[03:20:38.540 --> 03:20:49.780]  Alright, what's it like?
[03:20:49.780 --> 03:21:08.890]  I wanna thank you again for listening to a long episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:21:08.890 --> 03:21:11.530]  I'll be back Monday with a fresh episode.
[03:21:11.530 --> 03:21:14.770]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
