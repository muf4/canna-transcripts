[00:02.750 --> 00:05.750]  Roasted Jeff, you bad motherfucker.
[00:05.750 --> 00:09.750]  Oh shit, roasted Jeff in the house.

[00:59.340 --> 01:02.340]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[01:02.340 --> 01:07.340]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Doses and Mimosas Live Batter.
[01:07.340 --> 01:10.340]  This is a blend of bottle wash and Tahitian Punch.
[01:10.340 --> 01:14.340]  On the package, the flavor is described as citrus, lavender, and champagne.
[01:14.340 --> 01:16.340]  You know I really got the citrus flavor.
[01:16.340 --> 01:19.340]  The champagne is definitely abundant when you hit it and taste it.
[01:19.340 --> 01:24.340]  I never got the lavender flavor or aroma, but that is a good thing because I am not
[01:24.340 --> 01:29.340]  a big fan of lavender or lilac flavors or aromas, so it worked out perfectly for me.
[01:29.340 --> 01:33.340]  I'm sure if I went in a little bit hotter or a little bit cooler, maybe I'd pull out
[01:33.340 --> 01:37.340]  that lavender, but I'm not going to try because I feel lucky that I didn't get that flavor
[01:37.340 --> 01:38.340]  in my mouth.
[01:38.340 --> 01:43.340]  On the back of the package, it says the product does contain 68.21% THC and non-detectable
[01:43.340 --> 01:45.340]  amounts of CBD.
[01:45.340 --> 01:46.340]  I feel like I've got a nice head buzz.
[01:46.340 --> 01:47.340]  I'm nice and rambly.
[01:47.340 --> 01:51.340]  I feel like I'm going a little bit fast, but that may be good for a podcast.
[01:52.340 --> 01:56.340]  Shout out to the Doses and Mimosas Live Batter.
[01:56.340 --> 01:59.340]  All right, in this episode, I'm going to read a few Patreon messages.
[01:59.340 --> 02:04.340]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[02:04.340 --> 02:09.340]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[02:09.340 --> 02:10.340]  level or higher.
[02:10.340 --> 02:13.340]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:13.340 --> 02:14.340]  Thank you.
[02:14.340 --> 02:15.340]  Shout out to Karen Crawford.
[02:15.340 --> 02:17.340]  Let's follow that one up with a big shout out to Lefty.
[02:17.340 --> 02:18.340]  Hope you're doing well, brother.
[02:18.340 --> 02:20.340]  Let's follow that one up with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:20.340 --> 02:21.340]  Thank you.
[02:21.340 --> 02:22.340]  Shout out to my buddy, Kes Burton.
[02:22.340 --> 02:24.340]  Hey, Kes, I see what you're doing with the veterans.
[02:24.340 --> 02:25.340]  Thank you for all of your work.
[02:25.340 --> 02:26.340]  I see it.
[02:26.340 --> 02:28.340]  I notice it, and I appreciate it.
[02:28.340 --> 02:29.340]  Big fist bump.
[02:29.340 --> 02:30.340]  Lots of respect.
[02:30.340 --> 02:32.340]  Let's follow that one up with a special Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:32.340 --> 02:33.340]  Thank you.
[02:33.340 --> 02:34.340]  Shout out to our buddy, Mike M.
[02:34.340 --> 02:37.340]  I want to send a big thank you shout out and a high five to our buddy, Kent.
[02:37.340 --> 02:40.340]  Let's follow that up with the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:40.340 --> 02:41.340]  Thank you.
[02:41.340 --> 02:42.340]  Shout out to Dankster.
[02:42.340 --> 02:44.340]  I want to send a big special thank you to Kojax.
[02:44.340 --> 02:46.340]  I've always got a Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:46.340 --> 02:47.340]  Thank you.
[02:47.340 --> 02:49.340]  High five and a shout out and a fist bump to my friend, Nick.
[02:49.340 --> 02:50.340]  To my friend, Ned Denver.
[02:50.340 --> 02:56.340]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to a long time listener and long time supporter named Tommy.
[02:56.340 --> 02:57.340]  Big shout out, Tommy.
[02:57.340 --> 02:58.340]  Thank you for all the support, bro.
[02:58.340 --> 03:03.340]  And last, but certainly not least, I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast
[03:03.340 --> 03:07.340]  thank you shout out to my good friend, Tree Star Meadow.
[03:07.340 --> 03:12.340]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[03:12.340 --> 03:16.340]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[03:16.340 --> 03:22.340]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:22.340 --> 03:25.340]  All of the information you need will be right there on Patreon.
[03:25.340 --> 03:27.340]  They will teach you how to join.
[03:27.340 --> 03:28.340]  They will show you what's available.
[03:28.340 --> 03:30.340]  And I do thank you for the support.
[03:30.340 --> 03:36.340]  Of course, I did include a link in the show notes and the video description to make it nice and easy for you.
[03:36.340 --> 03:40.340]  I will also pop up a smooth little graphic on the screen so you can read it while you're watching the video.
[03:40.340 --> 03:41.340]  All right.
[03:41.340 --> 03:43.340]  So shout out to everybody on Patreon.
[03:43.340 --> 03:45.340]  I do appreciate all of that support.
[03:45.340 --> 03:47.340]  Support the show.
[03:47.340 --> 03:50.340]  Like I said before in a previous episode and on a Patreon video,
[03:50.340 --> 03:55.340]  all of those Patreon contributions made this new studio setup happen.
[03:55.340 --> 03:58.340]  I'm sure you could tell I've got this bright ass light in my face.
[03:58.340 --> 04:00.340]  I got this brand new camera, slick new table.
[04:00.340 --> 04:01.340]  We've been over this.
[04:01.340 --> 04:02.340]  Patreon did that.
[04:02.340 --> 04:03.340]  Thank you.
[04:03.340 --> 04:04.340]  I appreciate it.
[04:04.340 --> 04:08.340]  Also, let me know what you feel, what you think of this new setup.
[04:08.340 --> 04:09.340]  Do I sound good?
[04:09.340 --> 04:10.340]  Do I look good?
[04:10.340 --> 04:11.340]  Do I feel good?
[04:11.340 --> 04:12.340]  Please tell me.
[04:12.340 --> 04:13.340]  I appreciate your feedback.
[04:13.340 --> 04:17.340]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[04:17.340 --> 04:18.340]  All right.
[04:18.340 --> 04:19.340]  Where are we going to go from here?
[04:19.340 --> 04:22.340]  I wanted to make some suggestions to you guys.
[04:22.340 --> 04:27.340]  I don't usually come on here and make movie or video or TV show suggestions for you,
[04:27.340 --> 04:34.340]  but I feel like I would do you a disservice if I did not mention how much I laughed at a new show called The Cabin.
[04:34.340 --> 04:35.340]  That's right.
[04:35.340 --> 04:37.340]  My friend, Bert Kreischer, has a new show on Netflix.
[04:37.340 --> 04:39.340]  It is called The Cabin.
[04:39.340 --> 04:42.340]  The first 30 seconds had me sold.
[04:42.340 --> 04:49.340]  I knew that I was not going to leave the couch, the TV, the Netflix for the duration of however many shows were on that fucking series.
[04:49.340 --> 04:55.340]  I sat there and watched them, smoked dabs until I was unconscious and watched every episode of The Cabin.
[04:55.340 --> 04:59.340]  I promise you within the first 30 seconds, you know exactly what you're getting into.
[04:59.340 --> 05:01.340]  You will not stop laughing.
[05:01.340 --> 05:04.340]  That first 30 seconds tells you exactly what to expect.
[05:04.340 --> 05:06.340]  It sets the tone, sets the pace.
[05:06.340 --> 05:13.340]  So without gushing too much about my friend Bert Kreischer, I highly recommend his show called The Cabin.
[05:13.340 --> 05:17.340]  So I'm going to follow that up with another recommendation, and then we will move into cannabis content.
[05:17.340 --> 05:18.340]  I promise you.
[05:18.340 --> 05:23.340]  I highly recommend the Comedy Store documentary on Showtime.
[05:23.340 --> 05:26.340]  I am a huge comedy fan, a comedy nerd.
[05:26.340 --> 05:27.340]  I love stand-up comedy.
[05:27.340 --> 05:28.340]  I love comedy specials.
[05:28.340 --> 05:29.340]  I love comedians.
[05:29.340 --> 05:31.340]  I think laughter feels good.
[05:31.340 --> 05:32.340]  What's better?
[05:32.340 --> 05:35.340]  After you smoke a fat dab, what's better than laughing your ass off?
[05:35.340 --> 05:36.340]  I can think of a couple things.
[05:36.340 --> 05:40.340]  We're not going to talk about those here on the show, but laughter is one of the best fucking things on the planet.
[05:40.340 --> 05:41.340]  You could be in a terrible mood.
[05:41.340 --> 05:46.340]  You could be sick as fuck, and the stupidest shit can make you laugh your ass off.
[05:46.340 --> 05:52.340]  And for however long you're laughing, you're not thinking about the dumb shit that's happening in your mind, in your body, in the world.
[05:52.340 --> 05:54.340]  We're in tense times here in the world.
[05:54.340 --> 05:55.340]  We've got a lot of stuff going on.
[05:55.340 --> 05:56.340]  I'm not even going to mention it.
[05:56.340 --> 05:59.340]  I've done enough mentioning crazy shit on this show, right?
[05:59.340 --> 06:00.340]  We need laughter.
[06:00.340 --> 06:01.340]  We need other things.
[06:01.340 --> 06:02.340]  I think laughter is fucking beautiful.
[06:02.340 --> 06:03.340]  It's good for your soul.
[06:03.340 --> 06:04.340]  It's good for your spirit.
[06:04.340 --> 06:05.340]  It's good for your heart.
[06:05.340 --> 06:06.340]  It's good for your body.
[06:06.340 --> 06:07.340]  It's recharging.
[06:07.340 --> 06:09.340]  So here's something you can laugh at, you guys.
[06:09.340 --> 06:13.340]  I think the Comedy Store documentary on Showtime will make you laugh.
[06:13.340 --> 06:18.340]  If you're a comedy nerd, if you know who a lot of those people are and who they're talking about, it just may make you cry.
[06:18.340 --> 06:20.340]  It's a very touching documentary.
[06:20.340 --> 06:27.340]  It shows a lot about the comedy scene, the coming up of comedy, and it shows you kind of a behind-the-scenes look of something I'm really passionate about.
[06:27.340 --> 06:32.340]  So if you're into comedy, if you want a dramatic comedy thing that you could watch, you're going to laugh at it.
[06:32.340 --> 06:34.340]  Your significant other will laugh at it.
[06:34.340 --> 06:35.340]  You both may shed a tear.
[06:35.340 --> 06:38.340]  I highly recommend the Comedy Store documentary.
[06:38.340 --> 06:40.340]  Enough of Jeff's recommendations.
[06:40.340 --> 06:42.340]  Let's talk about growing cannabis, right?
[06:42.340 --> 06:44.340]  I said I was going to read some Patreon messages.
[06:44.340 --> 06:48.340]  I've got a couple of great messages here from friends who support the show on Patreon.
[06:48.340 --> 06:53.340]  This one comes from a fine young man who calls himself Yee Muh Fuckin Ha.
[06:53.340 --> 06:54.340]  He spelled it perfect.
[06:54.340 --> 06:57.340]  Yee Muh Fuckin Ha is exactly what it says.
[06:57.340 --> 06:58.340]  It goes on.
[06:58.340 --> 06:59.340]  It says, I do have a question.
[07:00.340 --> 07:05.340]  To the best of your knowledge, has the strain name Standing Ovation been taken or even Ovation?
[07:05.340 --> 07:06.340]  Bro, that's a great fucking name.
[07:06.340 --> 07:08.340]  Let me explain to you how he came across this name.
[07:08.340 --> 07:21.340]  It says, I was just glassing in the grow room this morning and looking at all the praying leaves, seeing healthy, happy plants, thinking about the incredible results I have had lately, and just thought the name would be so appropriate for so many reasons.
[07:21.340 --> 07:22.340]  Yeah, I get it.
[07:22.340 --> 07:25.340]  When you're in there looking at the plants in the morning, they've got their leaves up in the air.
[07:25.340 --> 07:26.340]  They're fucking praying.
[07:26.340 --> 07:28.340]  They're giving you that standing ovation.
[07:28.340 --> 07:29.340]  I get it, dude.
[07:29.340 --> 07:30.340]  I see.
[07:30.340 --> 07:31.340]  When you said the name, I knew where the inspiration came from.
[07:31.340 --> 07:33.340]  I think I may have written that down before.
[07:33.340 --> 07:40.340]  I don't want to take credit for a name that I don't promise you is written on the list, but I think it was Standing O, and we'll talk about that in a moment.
[07:40.340 --> 07:45.340]  But it says, I feel like you yourself should take a bow as we all applaud your work.
[07:45.340 --> 07:46.340]  That's pretty good, bro.
[07:46.340 --> 07:47.340]  Thank you.
[07:47.340 --> 07:53.340]  And then it says, and you know how it feels when friends try your herb and they're like, God damn, and sometimes you deserve a standing ovation.
[07:54.340 --> 07:59.340]  Plus, there's a linguistic connection between a rise and ovation that I thought was interesting, but I was high.
[07:59.340 --> 08:01.340]  Yes, you're high, but this is still great, bro.
[08:01.340 --> 08:03.340]  Some of the best ideas come out of us when we are baked.
[08:03.340 --> 08:08.340]  It says, if it resonates at all with you and hasn't been taken, I hope you consider the suggestion.
[08:08.340 --> 08:11.340]  Much respect, my dude.
[08:11.340 --> 08:16.340]  So instead of using it for a rise, how about also a good idea, bro.
[08:16.340 --> 08:17.340]  Bravo.
[08:17.340 --> 08:18.340]  Great idea.
[08:18.340 --> 08:19.340]  I'm going to give you fucking some cheers for that one.
[08:19.340 --> 08:21.340]  Now you get a standing ovation.
[08:21.340 --> 08:23.340]  You fucking stand up and fucking there you go.
[08:23.340 --> 08:26.340]  You officially, literally got a standing o out of me for that one.
[08:26.340 --> 08:32.340]  So what we're going to do, instead of using it for a rise, I think it would work better with orangegasm.
[08:32.340 --> 08:37.340]  Because I've always tried to make hashtag oface a thing when I'm advertising orangegasm.
[08:37.340 --> 08:41.340]  It never caught on, but now maybe that I've said it out loud, that was my intention.
[08:41.340 --> 08:44.340]  Hashtag oface for orangegasm.
[08:44.340 --> 08:45.340]  I thought it would be funny marketing.
[08:45.340 --> 08:46.340]  I thought it was funny.
[08:46.340 --> 08:48.340]  I tried that when I posted it up to Instagram.
[08:48.340 --> 08:51.340]  Nobody even noticed that I was posting hashtag oface.
[08:51.340 --> 08:52.340]  It got overlooked.
[08:52.340 --> 08:58.340]  But the standing ovation, the oface, those could be different phenotypes.
[08:58.340 --> 09:04.340]  We could name a phenotype of the orangegasm the standing ovation or that oface.
[09:04.340 --> 09:08.340]  That's just something that could go along with the marketing for the orangegasm.
[09:08.340 --> 09:10.340]  I don't think I'm going to use it as a strain name.
[09:10.340 --> 09:14.340]  If there's another breeder out there that wants to use that as a strain name, I don't.
[09:14.340 --> 09:15.340]  It doesn't fit my stuff.
[09:15.340 --> 09:17.340]  It kind of does, but I'm not going to go for it.
[09:17.340 --> 09:22.340]  I think it would be more of a phenotype name like we labeled that phenotype, the Rasta Jeff cut,
[09:22.340 --> 09:28.340]  the mean girl cut, the pungent cut, and now you've got the standing o cut and the oface cut.
[09:28.340 --> 09:30.340]  That's where I find it would be more appropriate.
[09:30.340 --> 09:31.340]  I do appreciate the feedback.
[09:31.340 --> 09:36.340]  I hate to reject your name here on a show, but I do love that name suggestion.
[09:36.340 --> 09:38.340]  It is just not for me right now.
[09:38.340 --> 09:39.340]  However, it may come up in the future.
[09:39.340 --> 09:42.340]  If somebody else beats me to it, that's a great name.
[09:42.340 --> 09:43.340]  Somebody should market that shit.
[09:44.340 --> 09:47.340]  All right, we're going to keep moving because I've got a couple of great messages here.
[09:47.340 --> 09:51.340]  This one comes from our friend HG, and it says,
[09:51.340 --> 10:00.340]  Hey Rasta Jeff, I'm a big fan of the show, and I've recently become able to supply my own medicine due to largely your tips.
[10:00.340 --> 10:01.340]  Man, thank you.
[10:01.340 --> 10:03.340]  That's a hard sentence for my brain to figure out what to say.
[10:03.340 --> 10:10.340]  It's hard to read, but once I figured it out, I'm glad you are growing great medicine and supply your own medicine largely due to my tips.
[10:10.340 --> 10:12.340]  It makes more sense when I said it out loud again.
[10:12.340 --> 10:15.340]  You saved my summer 2019 from death, so thank you.
[10:15.340 --> 10:19.340]  Bro, I'm glad I could rescue your summer 2019 crop.
[10:19.340 --> 10:23.340]  It says, On a recent episode, you and white Mike, and I actually corrected you on that one.
[10:23.340 --> 10:25.340]  It was Jesse that said this on the episode.
[10:25.340 --> 10:26.340]  I think it could have been Mike.
[10:26.340 --> 10:30.340]  90% sure Jesse is the one that said what you're going to talk about here.
[10:30.340 --> 10:39.340]  It says, You and Jesse talked about how you guys used to cut around caterpillar damage, but now that you've learned more, you've learned more, so now you just cut that shit away.
[10:39.340 --> 10:45.340]  Can you please elaborate as to what you have learned and some detail as to how your practices are different now?
[10:45.340 --> 10:55.340]  So, yes, in the outdoor episode, we did talk about how back in the day, if we found a bud with caterpillar damage in it, we try to cut that part away, and now we do things differently.
[10:55.340 --> 11:00.340]  Now we would simply throw the damaged, contaminated buds away.
[11:00.340 --> 11:02.340]  There are several reasons for that.
[11:02.340 --> 11:04.340]  Now we're not greedy.
[11:04.340 --> 11:15.340]  Back in the day, we were, and I hate to say it, we were black market growers where we had to do things sneakily, and we didn't have big facilities, and every fucking gram counted to pay the rent and all the other things.
[11:15.340 --> 11:17.340]  Now it's not such a cutthroat.
[11:17.340 --> 11:19.340]  It is cutthroat, but there's also quality assurance.
[11:19.340 --> 11:24.340]  I've got less ego, less struggle, less strife.
[11:24.340 --> 11:27.340]  What is the mentality when there's not enough to go around?
[11:27.340 --> 11:29.340]  I used to have that mentality.
[11:29.340 --> 11:30.340]  Now there's enough to go around.
[11:30.340 --> 11:34.340]  So I don't have to try to market that terrible product that's not safe and dangerous.
[11:34.340 --> 11:35.340]  I'm not as greedy.
[11:35.340 --> 11:36.340]  I've got better morals.
[11:36.340 --> 11:40.340]  I've got better ethics, and everybody deserves better, better quality.
[11:40.340 --> 11:45.340]  That stuff with the caterpillar damage, the bug shit in it, that's not Rasta Jeff quality.
[11:45.340 --> 11:46.340]  That's not up to my ethics.
[11:46.340 --> 11:50.340]  My responsibility is to provide a better product.
[11:50.340 --> 11:54.340]  My responsibility is to find that problem and make sure that doesn't get to people.
[11:54.340 --> 11:58.340]  We're making a medical marijuana product.
[11:58.340 --> 12:03.340]  It says medical marijuana on it, so people that are consuming this have a medical condition.
[12:03.340 --> 12:10.340]  I don't know if it's a broken knee or a lung disorder, but I don't want to give somebody with a lung disorder buds with fucking caterpillar damage in it.
[12:10.340 --> 12:12.340]  I don't want to give them buds with powdery mildew in it.
[12:12.340 --> 12:15.340]  I don't want to give them buds with spider mite eggs in it.
[12:15.340 --> 12:22.340]  So it's my responsibility to have better standards than that, than to just cut around it and give them the part that looks good.
[12:22.340 --> 12:28.340]  You just throw the part that isn't good away, and you save your reputation, you save your business, and you save the patients.
[12:28.340 --> 12:31.340]  They're patients, the people we are growing for, medical marijuana.
[12:31.340 --> 12:32.340]  This is their medicine.
[12:32.340 --> 12:34.340]  I don't want to make them sicker.
[12:34.340 --> 12:41.340]  When people consume the product that I grow and create, they feel better, and I get to watch them.
[12:41.340 --> 12:42.340]  I go to their house, and we roll up, right?
[12:42.340 --> 12:43.340]  And they're like, bro, I don't feel good.
[12:43.340 --> 12:44.340]  My muscles hurt.
[12:44.340 --> 12:45.340]  I don't mean to.
[12:45.340 --> 12:48.340]  That was almost disrespectful the way I did that, but that's what I see.
[12:48.340 --> 12:49.340]  They're like fucking tensed up.
[12:49.340 --> 12:50.340]  Bro, my body sucks.
[12:50.340 --> 12:51.340]  It hurts.
[12:51.340 --> 12:52.340]  I'm fucking in pain.
[12:52.340 --> 12:55.340]  And I'm like, well, here, bro, take a fucking dab, and let's smoke this joint.
[12:55.340 --> 12:57.340]  And by the time I leave, they're like, bro, so have a good day.
[12:57.340 --> 12:58.340]  I'll see you next time.
[12:58.340 --> 12:59.340]  Thanks for coming by.
[12:59.340 --> 13:04.340]  And their arms are waving around, and their neck is flopping because they're loosened up, and they're smiling, and they're having a good time.
[13:04.340 --> 13:06.340]  I got to do that to somebody.
[13:06.340 --> 13:08.340]  Me, myself, and my crew, I bred it.
[13:08.340 --> 13:09.340]  My crew and I grew it.
[13:09.340 --> 13:13.340]  We harvested, trimmed it, took care of it, got it to a patient that didn't feel well.
[13:13.340 --> 13:14.340]  They consumed it.
[13:14.340 --> 13:15.340]  They feel better.
[13:15.340 --> 13:20.340]  That fills me with pride and all kinds of other fucking amazing words, a lot of great things.
[13:20.340 --> 13:21.340]  I get filled up.
[13:21.340 --> 13:23.340]  Jubilation may be the appropriate word.
[13:23.340 --> 13:25.340]  I've never used jubilation before.
[13:25.340 --> 13:26.340]  There we go.
[13:26.340 --> 13:28.340]  But it fills me up with all kinds of good feelings.
[13:28.340 --> 13:33.340]  I want to feel good about what I'm giving my patients, my friends, the people that consume the products I grow.
[13:33.340 --> 13:42.340]  If I knew that there was caterpillar eggs, caterpillar shit, caterpillar damage, mold, blood rot, fungus in there, I wouldn't feel good about it.
[13:42.340 --> 13:45.340]  I would say, and I'm going to use my buddy Old Doug as an example.
[13:45.340 --> 13:48.340]  Old Doug's not the healthiest fucking old guy on the planet.
[13:48.340 --> 13:51.340]  Old Doug could probably smoke some healthy cannabis and be just fine.
[13:51.340 --> 13:58.340]  If we gave him some contaminated shit in probably three, five, seven to ten days, Doug's going to start coughing up weird shit.
[13:58.340 --> 14:01.340]  Doug's going to tell me, bro, I just haven't felt good for the past couple days.
[14:01.340 --> 14:07.340]  And I'm going to go, oh, man, I wonder if it was because of that caterpillar weed that I sold him or that fucking powdery mildew weed that I sold him.
[14:07.340 --> 14:09.340]  And I'm going to feel like shit.
[14:09.340 --> 14:11.340]  That's not what I'm here for.
[14:11.340 --> 14:13.340]  I don't want to feel like shit about anything that I do to people.
[14:13.340 --> 14:16.340]  I did enough of that shithead shit when I was younger.
[14:16.340 --> 14:19.340]  Twenties, early thirties, those are shithead days.
[14:19.340 --> 14:21.340]  I'm a fucking grown-ass man now.
[14:21.340 --> 14:23.340]  It's time to do grown-ass man things and step up.
[14:23.340 --> 14:33.340]  So that is the long way of saying I've just learned a lot about myself, about my goals, about my ethics, about quality, about maintaining a business.
[14:33.340 --> 14:36.340]  It's not about making that extra eighth out of the bag today.
[14:37.340 --> 14:47.340]  It's about making a long-term customer and patient that wants to buy 365 eighths every day through the next year because they didn't get one moldy one from me today.
[14:47.340 --> 14:52.340]  They'll buy 364 days in a row with intentions to buy the next 365.
[14:52.340 --> 15:05.340]  But if you sell them one eighth that they find some bullshit in it, you just lost 365 eighths worth of sales from that person because there are plenty of dispensaries, growers, and other people distributing the same product as us.
[15:05.340 --> 15:10.340]  You've got to have high standards, good quality, and you've got to have good ethics and good morals.
[15:10.340 --> 15:12.340]  So I think I went on long enough about that part.
[15:12.340 --> 15:14.340]  I'm going to keep going.
[15:14.340 --> 15:16.340]  The trimmers.
[15:16.340 --> 15:18.340]  So usually we said we used to cut that part out.
[15:18.340 --> 15:24.340]  This is where the trimmers come in as the quality assurance part of the cultivation facility.
[15:24.340 --> 15:26.340]  A lot of people downplay the importance of the trimmers.
[15:27.340 --> 15:35.340]  They think that the lead growers, the fucking king, the cultivation team are like the knights and shit, and then the trim crew are the peons, the villagers.
[15:35.340 --> 15:38.340]  That is in no way the truth.
[15:38.340 --> 15:46.340]  The fucking trim crew is just as important as the lead grower and the grow techs, just as important as the security guard, the manager, the owner, and the consultants.
[15:46.340 --> 15:48.340]  Those trimmers are quality assurance.
[15:48.340 --> 15:53.340]  They touch every single bud that goes through the cultivation facility.
[15:53.340 --> 15:54.340]  We chop it down.
[15:54.340 --> 15:55.340]  We hang it up.
[15:55.340 --> 15:58.340]  While they're cutting it, they see it while they're cutting it down.
[15:58.340 --> 16:00.340]  While they're leafing the hanging plants, they see it.
[16:00.340 --> 16:01.340]  They're looking at it.
[16:01.340 --> 16:03.340]  They're touching it hands-on, face-to-face.
[16:03.340 --> 16:10.340]  They have a closer relationship with some of those plants than I do sometimes because they've cut it up into little pieces and got to hold onto it like this.
[16:10.340 --> 16:11.340]  When I saw it, it was in a pot.
[16:11.340 --> 16:12.340]  It was fucking huge.
[16:12.340 --> 16:14.340]  They get to get up close and very personal.
[16:14.340 --> 16:15.340]  So they're trimming it.
[16:15.340 --> 16:18.340]  They've got a big magnifying glass.
[16:18.340 --> 16:22.340]  It's probably the size of an iPad, and it just sits right over the buds, and they put their hands and their scissors under that.
[16:22.340 --> 16:28.340]  They can see powdery mildew, caterpillar damage, spider mite damage, seeds, anything that may be in there.
[16:28.340 --> 16:29.340]  They're going to spot it.
[16:29.340 --> 16:31.340]  They are my quality control.
[16:31.340 --> 16:32.340]  They're quality assurance.
[16:32.340 --> 16:36.340]  They touch every bud, every flower that goes into your jar, past the trimmers' hands.
[16:36.340 --> 16:38.340]  They inspected it while they were trimming it.
[16:38.340 --> 16:40.340]  They saw that caterpillar damage.
[16:40.340 --> 16:43.340]  So the trimmers are the ones that find that.
[16:43.340 --> 16:45.340]  That is where the quality control happens.
[16:45.340 --> 16:51.340]  So, you guys, if you're thinking that the trimmers aren't fucking super important, without them, your ship will crash, and they are quality control.
[16:52.340 --> 16:55.340]  So don't buy machines and take good care of your trimmers.
[16:55.340 --> 16:56.340]  That's where I'm headed with that.
[16:56.340 --> 16:57.340]  There is more to this.
[16:57.340 --> 17:01.340]  It says, I am in spring outdoor flower with a lot of caterpillar damage.
[17:01.340 --> 17:04.340]  I've caught so many and cut away so much already.
[17:04.340 --> 17:11.340]  I may have to do ever clear extract for the first time just for sanitary reasons because I see caterpillar dung everywhere.
[17:11.340 --> 17:14.340]  By the time I am reading this message, you've probably harvested that outdoor.
[17:14.340 --> 17:17.340]  This was sitting in the pile just cooking.
[17:17.340 --> 17:19.340]  I apologize for taking a long time to get to that message.
[17:19.340 --> 17:26.340]  However, I hope I did answer your question about cutting parts out and why we changed our methods because we simply grew up.
[17:26.340 --> 17:31.340]  We've learned how to manage ourselves, our businesses, and our crops a little bit more professionally.
[17:31.340 --> 17:36.340]  And we know that the people relying on us deserve better than that from us.
[17:36.340 --> 17:38.340]  And we should teach people better as well.
[17:38.340 --> 17:39.340]  Lead by example.
[17:39.340 --> 17:40.340]  That's a thing that I've been taught.
[17:40.340 --> 17:43.340]  So I want to keep going because I can get quite rambly.
[17:43.340 --> 17:46.340]  I've got one more question for this episode.
[17:46.340 --> 17:48.340]  And it goes like this.
[17:48.340 --> 17:49.340]  Hey, Rasta Jeff.
[17:49.340 --> 17:50.340]  Hey, bro.
[17:50.340 --> 17:51.340]  Thanks for reaching out.
[17:51.340 --> 17:54.340]  It says, I want to start by saying thank you for the wealth of knowledge you are consistently sharing.
[17:54.340 --> 17:57.340]  And thanks for taking care of the audio as well as you do.
[17:57.340 --> 17:58.340]  Thank you for noticing.
[17:58.340 --> 18:00.340]  I've got all new equipment here.
[18:00.340 --> 18:03.340]  So I hope the audio sounds as good as you were expecting.
[18:03.340 --> 18:04.340]  I hope I am up to par.
[18:04.340 --> 18:06.340]  I've still got to learn where to keep this microphone.
[18:06.340 --> 18:07.340]  I feel like right here is best.
[18:07.340 --> 18:08.340]  But now it's in my view for reading.
[18:08.340 --> 18:10.340]  So there's some negotiating to be done.
[18:10.340 --> 18:12.340]  But I do appreciate the compliments.
[18:12.340 --> 18:14.340]  Let me know what you think about the new video.
[18:14.340 --> 18:15.340]  I keep mentioning video.
[18:15.340 --> 18:17.340]  And I haven't said the most important part.
[18:17.340 --> 18:21.340]  If you are not watching on YouTube at this point, I highly recommend you check us out on YouTube.
[18:21.340 --> 18:23.340]  I've done some major upgrades.
[18:23.340 --> 18:25.340]  The video is now in 4K.
[18:25.340 --> 18:28.340]  It looks fucking super crispy in my opinion.
[18:28.340 --> 18:29.340]  I'm still learning how to work the lighting.
[18:29.340 --> 18:31.340]  I'm learning some camera settings.
[18:31.340 --> 18:33.340]  I really like the way it looks on my screens today.
[18:33.340 --> 18:35.340]  Hopefully it comes up just like that on the video.
[18:35.340 --> 18:38.340]  But I think you will appreciate the 4K video.
[18:38.340 --> 18:41.340]  And I will get some sun on this shiny forehead.
[18:41.340 --> 18:42.340]  I'm used to wearing a hat.
[18:42.340 --> 18:44.340]  Trying to adult a little bit harder without the hat.
[18:44.340 --> 18:46.340]  So thank you for all the comments.
[18:46.340 --> 18:47.340]  Trust me. I know.
[18:47.340 --> 18:48.340]  Let's stay focused.
[18:48.340 --> 18:50.340]  You like the audio.
[18:50.340 --> 18:52.340]  Tell me what you think about the video.
[18:52.340 --> 18:53.340]  Not just you. Everybody out there.
[18:53.340 --> 18:56.340]  Hit me on Twitter at GFYH Podcast.
[18:56.340 --> 18:57.340]  Or send me an email.
[18:57.340 --> 18:59.340]  GrowFromYourHeartAtHotmail.com
[18:59.340 --> 19:01.340]  Let's keep me focused because I'm high as shit today.
[19:01.340 --> 19:07.340]  It says, another big shout out to your flavor and high profiles from what you're dabbing on as well.
[19:07.340 --> 19:11.340]  I love hearing what you guys are able to get out there in Colorado.
[19:11.340 --> 19:13.340]  I'm glad you appreciate it bro.
[19:13.340 --> 19:16.340]  Because some people have sent me messages saying, quit talking about what you're dabbing.
[19:16.340 --> 19:17.340]  We don't fucking care.
[19:17.340 --> 19:18.340]  You're just showing off.
[19:18.340 --> 19:19.340]  You're rubbing it in.
[19:19.340 --> 19:21.340]  I live in a place where I can't get that.
[19:21.340 --> 19:22.340]  And all you do is piss me off.
[19:22.340 --> 19:24.340]  So I'm glad that you appreciate it.
[19:24.340 --> 19:26.340]  And that you can live vicariously through me.
[19:26.340 --> 19:27.340]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[19:27.340 --> 19:29.340]  I'm trying to let you know what I smoked.
[19:29.340 --> 19:31.340]  What I got to experience.
[19:31.340 --> 19:32.340]  What the flavor was like.
[19:32.340 --> 19:33.340]  What the turps were like.
[19:33.340 --> 19:36.340]  And then I try to tell you how it made me feel.
[19:36.340 --> 19:41.340]  Also that will give you an indication of why I'm fucking talking so god damn fast.
[19:41.340 --> 19:42.340]  Which is from this Doses and Mimosas.
[19:42.340 --> 19:45.340]  It's got me firing on all cylinders.
[19:45.340 --> 19:46.340]  That is for damn sure.
[19:46.340 --> 19:47.340]  I like it.
[19:47.340 --> 19:48.340]  It's a good thing.
[19:48.340 --> 19:51.340]  But sometimes when I smoke the TKD number 10, that one puts me kind of chilled out.
[19:51.340 --> 19:53.340]  And I get a little bit slower.
[19:53.340 --> 19:54.340]  So that's why I share it.
[19:54.340 --> 19:55.340]  Because I like you guys to know.
[19:55.340 --> 19:56.340]  Kind of bring you in with me.
[19:56.340 --> 19:59.340]  And also some of my friends live near me.
[19:59.340 --> 20:00.340]  Or in the same state.
[20:00.340 --> 20:03.340]  And all over Colorado you can get the Doses and Mimosas.
[20:03.340 --> 20:05.340]  So maybe they're dabbing the same thing.
[20:05.340 --> 20:07.340]  And they'll grab a jar of it and go, hey me too.
[20:07.340 --> 20:09.340]  And they're hitting the Doses and Mimosas with me.
[20:09.340 --> 20:10.340]  And then we're both talking too fast.
[20:10.340 --> 20:11.340]  Unity.
[20:11.340 --> 20:13.340]  That's all I'm trying to do is bring you in, bro.
[20:13.340 --> 20:14.340]  Share my life.
[20:14.340 --> 20:15.340]  I'm glad you enjoy it.
[20:15.340 --> 20:16.340]  Let's keep going.
[20:16.340 --> 20:17.340]  It says, I'm about to harvest some of my plants.
[20:17.340 --> 20:22.340]  And I've always heard mild bro science regarding hours of darkness prior to harvest.
[20:22.340 --> 20:25.340]  I've heard you talk about your last few days being 18-6.
[20:25.340 --> 20:28.340]  But I'm not sure I remember if you talked about darkness.
[20:28.340 --> 20:33.340]  I have seen some test results that seem to show some different cannabinoid levels
[20:33.340 --> 20:37.340]  when harvested during different intervals of light deprivation.
[20:37.340 --> 20:39.340]  I'm sure that is accurate.
[20:39.340 --> 20:42.340]  So what we're talking about is at the end of harvest, those last couple of days,
[20:42.340 --> 20:45.340]  so your plants say they go 65 days.
[20:45.340 --> 20:49.340]  We're going to put them for 65 days in flower, then 67, 68, 69.
[20:49.340 --> 20:51.340]  Total fucking darkness.
[20:51.340 --> 20:52.340]  That's what this guy is talking about.
[20:52.340 --> 20:53.340]  That is not uncommon.
[20:53.340 --> 20:55.340]  I hear about that a lot.
[20:55.340 --> 20:58.340]  It's usually 24 or 48 hours of total darkness.
[20:58.340 --> 21:00.340]  This guy is going to go three full days.
[21:00.340 --> 21:02.340]  I guess that can't be a huge problem.
[21:02.340 --> 21:03.340]  It's not.
[21:03.340 --> 21:04.340]  They're already in the dark.
[21:04.340 --> 21:05.340]  They're not going to herm out or anything like that.
[21:05.340 --> 21:07.340]  They don't have time.
[21:08.340 --> 21:14.340]  So he says he has seen different cannabinoid levels from different levels of light deprivation.
[21:14.340 --> 21:16.340]  I completely agree with that and believe that.
[21:16.340 --> 21:19.340]  They're going to change and kind of freak out toward the end there.
[21:19.340 --> 21:22.340]  So you're going to see different things by doing different things to them.
[21:22.340 --> 21:24.340]  That completely makes sense.
[21:24.340 --> 21:33.340]  I actually do 18-6 for the last 10 days, and I don't do a dark cycle, a long dark cycle right now.
[21:33.340 --> 21:36.340]  Honestly, most of what I'm growing is either a phenohunt run,
[21:36.340 --> 21:38.340]  so I don't want to do something super crazy to that.
[21:38.340 --> 21:42.340]  So I do just 12-12 or 11-13 on my phenohunt test runs.
[21:42.340 --> 21:45.340]  My seeded crops, they all finish at 18-6.
[21:45.340 --> 21:51.340]  My smokable flower runs, sometimes I do them 18-6 for the last two weeks or 10 days.
[21:51.340 --> 21:56.340]  But a lot of times I don't have room and manipulation space because I have other things in the rooms.
[21:56.340 --> 22:02.340]  But most of the time it's 18-6 for the last 10 days if I can, but I don't do that longer dark period.
[22:03.340 --> 22:08.340]  If they're seeded, I do them 18-6 for like fucking 30 full days, maybe even longer.
[22:08.340 --> 22:10.340]  But those are seeded plants.
[22:10.340 --> 22:12.340]  My world is crazy when it comes to growing.
[22:12.340 --> 22:15.340]  Let me keep focused so I don't give any weird advice here.
[22:15.340 --> 22:23.340]  It says, I just tossed my three plants into a dark room for what will amount to 36 hours of total darkness prior to chop tomorrow night after work.
[22:23.340 --> 22:25.340]  So we've got 36 hours, not three days.
[22:25.340 --> 22:26.340]  I misread that.
[22:26.340 --> 22:31.340]  Can you speak to the efficacy or lack thereof of darkness prior to harvest?
[22:31.340 --> 22:32.340]  Thanks again for everything.
[22:32.340 --> 22:34.340]  You can use my name if needed.
[22:34.340 --> 22:35.340]  Shout out to my friend Evan.
[22:35.340 --> 22:37.340]  Thank you for the great message.
[22:37.340 --> 22:42.340]  Evan, you said in the beginning of the message that you have heard a bunch of bro science.
[22:42.340 --> 22:46.340]  I'm going to back your bro science up with a whole bunch of bro science.
[22:46.340 --> 22:48.340]  I don't have a lab.
[22:48.340 --> 22:49.340]  I don't have testing equipment.
[22:49.340 --> 22:51.340]  But I've got experience.
[22:51.340 --> 22:58.340]  In my opinion, my experience is as valid as a book, as a lab, because I can see what's happening.
[22:58.340 --> 22:59.340]  I'm pretty observational.
[22:59.340 --> 23:00.340]  I'm pretty smart.
[23:00.340 --> 23:05.340]  But again, this is bro science from things I've read and things I've seen in my own grow.
[23:05.340 --> 23:10.340]  So what I understand is light degrades terpenes.
[23:10.340 --> 23:18.340]  As the powerful grow light is shining down onto your plants and hitting your trichomes, the terpenes are being disrupted, volatized, destroyed.
[23:18.340 --> 23:22.340]  There are other words that we can use, vaporized in the process.
[23:22.340 --> 23:26.340]  So darkness would probably, in theory, increase terps.
[23:27.340 --> 23:31.340]  You ever go in the room during the day and it smells like moist grow room?
[23:31.340 --> 23:35.340]  You go in the grow room during the dark cycle, it smells like fucking dank weed.
[23:35.340 --> 23:38.340]  That kind of gives me the belief that something's happening in the dark cycle.
[23:38.340 --> 23:41.340]  It's not just a transpiration or a respiration thing.
[23:41.340 --> 23:46.340]  I think there are more terps present in that dark cycle because the heat and the light are not breaking them down.
[23:46.340 --> 23:50.340]  So dark for terp preservation is a good start.
[23:50.340 --> 23:53.340]  Also, heat breaks down your terps.
[23:53.340 --> 23:56.340]  So the cold in there, when it's not as bright, it's not as hot.
[23:56.340 --> 23:59.340]  So that cool, dark, you may be building up more terpenes.
[23:59.340 --> 24:01.340]  That may be a real thing.
[24:01.340 --> 24:06.340]  Also, I have experienced that some cultivars do gain in density.
[24:06.340 --> 24:08.340]  They get tighter in structure.
[24:08.340 --> 24:09.340]  The buds tighten up.
[24:09.340 --> 24:10.340]  They get a little chunkier.
[24:10.340 --> 24:15.340]  I have noticed that in like more indica-dominant, whiter-leaved, purple kind of plants.
[24:15.340 --> 24:17.340]  They will do that a little bit more.
[24:17.340 --> 24:23.340]  The thinner-leaved, longer, skinnier sativa kind of plants, they don't do it as much.
[24:23.340 --> 24:25.340]  So that's something that I've noticed.
[24:25.340 --> 24:30.340]  Also, I don't think your plants are going to make more trichomes while they are in the dark.
[24:30.340 --> 24:33.340]  We've only got 72 hours or 36 hours.
[24:33.340 --> 24:35.340]  That's a day and a half.
[24:35.340 --> 24:39.340]  If you do produce more trichomes, those plants have been in flower for days.
[24:39.340 --> 24:41.340]  We've been waiting for those trichomes to get ripe.
[24:41.340 --> 24:44.340]  Any new trichomes that pop up aren't going to have time to ripen.
[24:45.340 --> 24:49.340]  So that's why we're going to see varying test results in my theory, in my opinion.
[24:49.340 --> 24:57.340]  Also, I think lab testing is the only way you're going to get totally, completely accurate information on what we're doing.
[24:57.340 --> 24:59.340]  Keep in mind I did say bro science.
[24:59.340 --> 25:01.340]  This is totally bro science.
[25:01.340 --> 25:03.340]  I gave a lot of disclaimers on that.
[25:03.340 --> 25:07.340]  But what I think happens when you put your plant in the darkness like that, it kind of goes in panic mode.
[25:07.340 --> 25:09.340]  And it knows that it's over.
[25:09.340 --> 25:11.340]  It's like, hey, the plant relies on the sun.
[25:11.340 --> 25:13.340]  The sun tells it, hey, it's springtime.
[25:13.340 --> 25:14.340]  It's supposed to veg.
[25:14.340 --> 25:15.340]  Then it goes, hey, it's falltime.
[25:15.340 --> 25:16.340]  I'm supposed to flower.
[25:16.340 --> 25:19.340]  And then it starts going, hey, the days have been getting short.
[25:19.340 --> 25:21.340]  I better hurry up and finish.
[25:21.340 --> 25:25.340]  My whole goal in life is to get pollinated so I can reproduce and make seeds.
[25:25.340 --> 25:30.340]  And if you're not going to pollinate me and let me produce seeds, I'm just going to get bigger and bigger and make bigger, fatter buds.
[25:30.340 --> 25:34.340]  So when you turn off the sun, it goes, dude, it's the fucking end.
[25:34.340 --> 25:37.340]  So those buds just beef up and swell the best they can at the end.
[25:37.340 --> 25:39.340]  Then you've got that darkness.
[25:39.340 --> 25:42.340]  That darkness provides more terpenes, I think.
[25:42.340 --> 25:45.340]  And then you've got that cool, which provides more terpenes, I think.
[25:45.340 --> 25:47.340]  So you're going to get swelling.
[25:47.340 --> 25:51.340]  You're going to get ripening of the trichomes because they don't have the daytime cycle.
[25:51.340 --> 25:52.340]  The plant's just going to freak out.
[25:52.340 --> 25:54.340]  Some of the processes aren't going to happen.
[25:54.340 --> 25:56.340]  So it may help you ripen up.
[25:56.340 --> 25:58.340]  It may help you get a little more density.
[25:58.340 --> 26:00.340]  And it may add to flavor.
[26:00.340 --> 26:02.340]  This is going to be strain-specific.
[26:02.340 --> 26:04.340]  This could be cultivar-specific.
[26:04.340 --> 26:06.340]  This could just be very specific to the plant.
[26:06.340 --> 26:09.340]  You are like one out of seven plants in your grow may love this.
[26:09.340 --> 26:10.340]  How many plants you say you've got?
[26:10.340 --> 26:11.340]  You've got three?
[26:11.340 --> 26:12.340]  One of them may hate this.
[26:12.340 --> 26:13.340]  Two of them may hate this.
[26:13.340 --> 26:15.340]  They all three may love it.
[26:15.340 --> 26:18.340]  That's going to be based on the plant that you are doing this with.
[26:18.340 --> 26:22.340]  But in most results, it doesn't cause – in most experience, it doesn't cause problems.
[26:22.340 --> 26:26.340]  It causes more increase in density and flavors and aromas.
[26:26.340 --> 26:30.340]  All right, my buddy Evan, I do appreciate the great message and the great question.
