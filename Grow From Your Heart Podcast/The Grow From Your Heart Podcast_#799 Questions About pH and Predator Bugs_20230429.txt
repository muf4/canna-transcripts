[00:03.200 --> 00:24.040]  All right, here we go.
[00:24.040 --> 00:25.600]  Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[00:25.600 --> 00:27.120]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:27.120 --> 00:32.120]  This is episode 799 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:32.120 --> 00:34.320]  I've got a fun episode lined up for us.
[00:34.320 --> 00:37.040]  In this episode, I'm going to give away free seeds.
[00:37.040 --> 00:41.760]  That's right, I've teamed up with seedsherenow.com to give away free iRegenetic seeds.
[00:41.760 --> 00:44.160]  We're going to talk more about that later in this episode.
[00:44.160 --> 00:48.240]  I do want to start off by sending a big thank you shout out to everybody who did support
[00:48.240 --> 00:51.400]  the 420 sale on iRedirect.com.
[00:51.400 --> 00:52.400]  Thank you for the support.
[00:52.400 --> 00:53.640]  I do appreciate that.
[00:53.640 --> 00:57.300]  Of course, by the time this episode comes out, the April sale will be over.
[00:57.300 --> 01:00.160]  We are working on a fresh sale for the month of May.
[01:00.160 --> 01:01.600]  There will also be a fresh drop.
[01:01.600 --> 01:04.680]  There are two new products that will be added to the website, possibly more.
[01:04.680 --> 01:07.200]  I know there are two coming out that you have been waiting for.
[01:07.200 --> 01:08.960]  Make sure you check iRedirect.com.
[01:08.960 --> 01:12.760]  They will be on the website very soon if they're not already there by the time this episode
[01:12.760 --> 01:13.760]  comes out.
[01:13.760 --> 01:19.720]  Also, make sure you join the Patreon campaign at patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:19.720 --> 01:22.440]  Patreon does get the very first heads up when seeds drop.
[01:22.440 --> 01:25.920]  They get the first heads up when there are new sales, new stock, or just things that
[01:25.920 --> 01:28.040]  you might want to be aware of.
[01:28.040 --> 01:30.040]  Patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:30.040 --> 01:33.640]  Also, don't forget to sign up for the newsletter or the mailing list.
[01:33.640 --> 01:36.720]  You can sign up for that at iRegenetics.com.
[01:36.720 --> 01:38.280]  Simply scroll down to the bottom of the page.
[01:38.280 --> 01:40.220]  There's a little tab that looks like an envelope.
[01:40.220 --> 01:42.480]  It says stay tuned or stay up to date.
[01:42.480 --> 01:43.480]  Type in your email address.
[01:43.480 --> 01:45.680]  That will add you to the mailing list.
[01:45.680 --> 01:49.960]  When I do new drops or promotions or updates to the website, I do send out updates to the
[01:49.960 --> 01:50.960]  mailing list.
[01:50.960 --> 01:55.600]  Of course, Patreon does get that first update, but it will go Patreon, then the mailing list.
[01:55.600 --> 01:56.600]  Then after that, it's Discord.
[01:56.600 --> 01:58.680]  Then I go to the social medias.
[01:58.680 --> 02:03.360]  Be sure to join the mailing list or the Patreon campaign so you don't miss the fresh drops
[02:03.360 --> 02:06.280]  at iRedirect.com.
[02:06.280 --> 02:11.040]  Speaking of fresh drops, I will be at the Dude Grows Cup June 3rd in Fort Collins.
[02:11.040 --> 02:12.040]  That's right.
[02:12.040 --> 02:15.960]  Our friends at the Dude Grows show are throwing the Dude Grows Cup once again just outside
[02:15.960 --> 02:17.280]  of Fort Collins.
[02:17.280 --> 02:18.640]  Team iRegenetics will be there.
[02:18.640 --> 02:22.360]  We'll have a bunch of fresh new products with us, a bunch of the familiar stuff, a bunch
[02:22.360 --> 02:25.880]  of new stuff, a bunch of regular, a bunch of feminized things that I think you will
[02:25.880 --> 02:27.120]  really enjoy.
[02:27.120 --> 02:31.120]  Come join us at the Dude Grows Cup just outside of Fort Collins on June 3rd.
[02:31.120 --> 02:34.640]  Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all of that information.
[02:34.640 --> 02:35.640]  All right.
[02:35.640 --> 02:38.200]  I feel like we've covered all of the business part here at the start of the podcast.
[02:38.200 --> 02:41.080]  I do have something I kind of want to segue into.
[02:41.080 --> 02:46.720]  I'm not sure if you pay attention to the news, but recently a man was executed in Singapore
[02:46.720 --> 02:49.800]  for possession of 2.2 pounds of cannabis.
[02:49.800 --> 02:50.800]  That's right.
[02:50.800 --> 02:53.440]  A man was executed for cannabis.
[02:53.440 --> 02:54.880]  I don't believe that that is right.
[02:54.880 --> 02:56.400]  I don't believe that that is fair.
[02:56.400 --> 02:57.480]  I think that that is wrong.
[02:57.480 --> 02:59.160]  I think that's terrible.
[02:59.160 --> 03:04.120]  Being somebody who promotes, advocates, supports, and thoroughly enjoys cannabis, this is fucking
[03:04.120 --> 03:09.120]  heartbreaking to hear that somebody was put to death for possession of an herb that causes
[03:09.120 --> 03:14.040]  no harm in my opinion or experience and makes people feel better in a recreational and a
[03:14.040 --> 03:15.040]  medical way.
[03:15.040 --> 03:16.040]  This person is gone.
[03:16.040 --> 03:17.120]  They had children.
[03:17.120 --> 03:18.280]  They had a family.
[03:18.280 --> 03:19.480]  And this person is gone.
[03:19.480 --> 03:24.280]  The government in their country decided that they needed to kill this person for cannabis.
[03:24.280 --> 03:26.040]  That is fucking crazy to me.
[03:26.040 --> 03:29.040]  Now another thing I want to add to this, and you'll see how they connect in just a moment,
[03:29.040 --> 03:32.800]  is I was talking to a friend who was recently traveling around the world and they went to
[03:32.800 --> 03:37.760]  Australia and they found themselves in Australia smoking a little bit of pot in front of a
[03:37.760 --> 03:38.760]  bar.
[03:38.760 --> 03:39.880]  Somebody walked up to them and said, Hey mate.
[03:39.880 --> 03:41.760]  I'm not sure they said, Hey mate, but they're Australian.
[03:41.760 --> 03:43.120]  So they probably did.
[03:43.120 --> 03:44.560]  They said, Hey mate, you can't smoke that.
[03:44.560 --> 03:46.600]  The cops are already on the way looking for you.
[03:46.600 --> 03:48.320]  They smelled it down the street.
[03:48.320 --> 03:51.680]  And my friend said, what the, you can't just smoke a joint in front of a bar here.
[03:51.680 --> 03:57.040]  And they said, no, you will go straight to jail for having cannabis with you here.
[03:57.040 --> 03:58.600]  So you've got to get rid of that.
[03:58.600 --> 03:59.600]  You've got to hide.
[03:59.600 --> 04:00.960]  You've got to get rid of the smell.
[04:00.960 --> 04:02.360]  So my friend had to get rid of his cannabis.
[04:02.360 --> 04:03.360]  He had to get rid of the cannabis.
[04:03.360 --> 04:04.360]  He was smoking.
[04:04.360 --> 04:06.080]  He had to get rid of his stash and his accessories.
[04:06.080 --> 04:09.500]  He had to go somewhere, make sure he didn't smell like cannabis because they were looking
[04:09.500 --> 04:10.920]  for this person.
[04:10.920 --> 04:14.480]  Where I'm headed with this, you guys, I'm here in Colorado.
[04:14.480 --> 04:17.000]  My friend was from Colorado.
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.000]  Don't forget sometimes that it is not all Colorado.
[04:20.040 --> 04:22.920]  It is not safe to travel everywhere with cannabis.
[04:22.920 --> 04:26.180]  It is not safe to consume cannabis openly everywhere.
[04:26.180 --> 04:27.300]  You've got to keep your heads up.
[04:27.300 --> 04:31.360]  You've got to learn about the rules, the laws, the regulations before you go somewhere and
[04:31.360 --> 04:33.560]  find out what type of risk you're putting yourself in.
[04:33.560 --> 04:39.200]  If you do travel with cannabis or consume or acquire cannabis in a foreign or strange
[04:39.200 --> 04:41.000]  land, it could be a different state.
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.580]  If I'm going to a different state, I do research before I go there.
[04:44.580 --> 04:45.860]  Can I take cannabis?
[04:45.860 --> 04:47.440]  What happens if I do take cannabis?
[04:47.440 --> 04:49.340]  What happens if I take concentrates?
[04:49.340 --> 04:52.480]  What kind of trouble am I going to get into if I get caught with a couple of joints?
[04:52.480 --> 04:56.360]  What kind of trouble do I get into if I get caught with a couple grams of cannabis?
[04:56.360 --> 04:58.700]  What kind of trouble do I get into for traveling with it?
[04:58.700 --> 05:02.660]  I do all of that research if I'm going to a state next to me, a few states over.
[05:02.660 --> 05:06.380]  If I'm flying somewhere, I think about all of that stuff before I travel.
[05:06.380 --> 05:10.860]  Do extra research on that if you are traveling abroad, going to another country with different
[05:10.860 --> 05:13.120]  laws, rules, and regulations.
[05:13.120 --> 05:15.740]  Whatever you think works here may not work there.
[05:15.740 --> 05:17.220]  Things are different in other countries.
[05:17.220 --> 05:19.620]  Once you're in their country, you are under their laws.
[05:19.620 --> 05:21.300]  You've got to follow their laws.
[05:21.300 --> 05:22.940]  You may be a privileged person here.
[05:22.940 --> 05:26.640]  You may not fit a certain criteria here where you're going to get searched and hassled.
[05:26.640 --> 05:30.740]  In another country, you're probably exactly who they're going to search and hassle.
[05:30.740 --> 05:34.620]  So my point of this is somebody has been executed for cannabis in another country.
[05:34.620 --> 05:39.340]  A person I know was almost arrested and given a really hard time for consuming cannabis,
[05:39.340 --> 05:42.480]  just a little tiny bit of cannabis outside of a bar in Australia.
[05:42.480 --> 05:44.420]  My point here is be very careful, you guys.
[05:44.420 --> 05:46.940]  I don't want you to get put in a foreign jail.
[05:47.060 --> 05:49.060]  We'll never hear from you again, dude.
[05:49.060 --> 05:51.900]  They're going to feed you terrible food and treat you like shit forever because you're
[05:51.900 --> 05:54.780]  an American in a foreign prison, in a foreign jail.
[05:54.780 --> 05:55.900]  Good luck with that.
[05:55.900 --> 05:59.700]  And I definitely don't want you executed for enjoying our favorite plant.
[05:59.700 --> 06:01.580]  Don't be a statistic in another country.
[06:01.580 --> 06:02.620]  I know it's fun to smoke.
[06:02.620 --> 06:05.420]  It's fun to get high and enter at your own risk.
[06:05.420 --> 06:08.900]  But I'm saying understand the risk and be as careful as possible.
[06:08.900 --> 06:09.900]  All right.
[06:09.900 --> 06:12.100]  That's enough of the news talk I wanted to cover today.
[06:12.100 --> 06:16.700]  Let's segue into the cannabis cultivation and cannabis questions portion of this podcast.
[06:16.700 --> 06:19.980]  I do have a lot of great questions that I do want to answer.
[06:19.980 --> 06:26.180]  This question that I'm about to read did come from the GrowHelp tab on iRegenetics.com.
[06:26.180 --> 06:27.860]  That was harder to say than it looked.
[06:27.860 --> 06:31.780]  If you go to iRegenetics.com, there's a row of tabs on the top.
[06:31.780 --> 06:33.760]  One of them says questions or grow help.
[06:33.760 --> 06:38.060]  If you click on that tab, you will be given the opportunity to fill out a questionnaire
[06:38.060 --> 06:39.780]  asking about your garden.
[06:39.780 --> 06:43.820]  And at the end, you are given the opportunity to ask a grow question.
[06:43.820 --> 06:48.140]  This grow question came from our friend, Polly Two Fingers, said, what kind of question do
[06:48.140 --> 06:49.140]  you have?
[06:49.140 --> 06:50.340]  It is a general grow question.
[06:50.340 --> 06:53.540]  The question from Polly Two Fingers goes a lot like this.
[06:53.540 --> 06:55.500]  It says, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[06:55.500 --> 06:56.500]  What's up, Polly?
[06:56.500 --> 06:57.500]  Good to meet you, bro.
[06:57.500 --> 06:58.500]  It says, I love your podcast.
[06:58.500 --> 07:00.340]  Thank you, bro, because I love you too.
[07:00.340 --> 07:03.180]  It says, seriously, it is one of the best for real knowledge.
[07:03.180 --> 07:04.180]  I appreciate that.
[07:04.180 --> 07:05.180]  Thank you.
[07:05.180 --> 07:06.480]  It says, not just bro science.
[07:06.480 --> 07:09.700]  Some of it is bro science, but it's also I've got a lot of experience.
[07:09.740 --> 07:11.380]  So I feel like I can talk from experience.
[07:11.380 --> 07:12.660]  I read a lot.
[07:12.660 --> 07:14.220]  And then there is some bro science mixed in.
[07:14.220 --> 07:16.780]  It says, it's actually quite quality info.
[07:16.780 --> 07:17.780]  Thank you, brother.
[07:17.780 --> 07:18.780]  I do appreciate that.
[07:18.780 --> 07:21.460]  I try hard to give you real, reliable, accurate info.
[07:21.460 --> 07:25.200]  I feel like you guys are going to use the advice that I give you in your garden.
[07:25.200 --> 07:29.220]  And I would feel like a real, a terrible person if you messed up your garden based on the
[07:29.220 --> 07:31.300]  advice that I give you.
[07:31.300 --> 07:32.580]  I try to be better than that.
[07:32.580 --> 07:33.580]  So it goes on.
[07:33.580 --> 07:35.620]  It says, my question is this.
[07:35.620 --> 07:37.540]  This is a really good question here also.
[07:37.540 --> 07:38.540]  Why?
[07:38.540 --> 07:39.540]  Why oh why does?
[07:40.380 --> 07:41.780]  I have a pH drift in my reservoir.
[07:41.780 --> 07:43.620]  That's a really good, very common question.
[07:43.620 --> 07:46.740]  I've got a good logical exclamation, but let's go a little further.
[07:46.740 --> 07:50.380]  I did say exclamation on purpose just so you know, so you're paying attention.
[07:50.380 --> 07:55.980]  It says, I've heard it will go down if there is a bacteria, but mine wants to rise slowly
[07:55.980 --> 07:57.620]  as days go by.
[07:57.620 --> 07:59.260]  I'm using flora flex nutrients.
[07:59.260 --> 08:02.260]  They are salt based and I run a sterile system.
[08:02.260 --> 08:04.300]  They claim their nutrients are stable for weeks.
[08:04.300 --> 08:07.780]  I'm just curious if you have any good info on this issue.
[08:07.820 --> 08:12.820]  I've not heard anyone tackle this issue and I feel like this pH drifting will affect my
[08:12.820 --> 08:13.820]  final product.
[08:13.820 --> 08:14.820]  It will.
[08:14.820 --> 08:15.820]  It goes on.
[08:15.820 --> 08:19.260]  It says, I'm looking at getting a blue lab pH controller with the pump to keep it dialed
[08:19.260 --> 08:20.260]  in.
[08:20.260 --> 08:24.380]  Any help is greatly appreciated from your friend, Polly two fingers.
[08:24.380 --> 08:30.060]  Polly, I've got a really great, really logical, really rational explanation for what I think
[08:30.060 --> 08:33.660]  is happening here in your grow while your pH is rising.
[08:33.660 --> 08:35.740]  This could be a reservoir for hydroponics.
[08:35.740 --> 08:37.860]  This could be a reservoir for an auto watering system.
[08:37.860 --> 08:40.140]  It could be an Evan Evan flow table.
[08:40.140 --> 08:41.220]  It could be a drain to waste table.
[08:41.220 --> 08:44.900]  I don't know exactly what you've got set up, but I imagine a large reservoir.
[08:44.900 --> 08:49.740]  Um, and from that reservoir, water will be pumped out of that into your plants.
[08:49.740 --> 08:53.140]  Um, over time there will be evaporation, right?
[08:53.140 --> 08:57.480]  Though he, what the water is going to evaporate from that vessel, from your reservoir.
[08:57.480 --> 09:02.500]  So the water level is going to go down, but as that water evaporates, guess what happens?
[09:02.500 --> 09:05.940]  The salts from your bottled nutrients do not evaporate.
[09:05.940 --> 09:07.860]  So they're becoming more concentrated.
[09:07.860 --> 09:12.460]  You'll also notice if you measure the pH or the EC, it is probably slightly rising as
[09:12.460 --> 09:16.700]  well because water has evaporated and none of the salts that you have added to that water
[09:16.700 --> 09:17.900]  are leaving their solids.
[09:17.900 --> 09:18.940]  They're not leaving.
[09:18.940 --> 09:22.660]  So the water is up in the air now it's up in there as vapor, it's becoming clouds, it's
[09:22.660 --> 09:24.900]  becoming rain, it's becoming humidity.
[09:24.900 --> 09:25.900]  It's a problem in the grow.
[09:25.900 --> 09:30.480]  Maybe it's sucked right back up into the dehumidifier, but those nutrients are still right there
[09:30.480 --> 09:31.480]  in your reservoir.
[09:31.480 --> 09:35.600]  So if you've got less water, they might be very minute difference amount of water, but
[09:35.600 --> 09:37.600]  it can make a big difference in the pH and the EC.
[09:37.600 --> 09:41.560]  So you've got a little bit less water and you haven't reduced the amount of salts.
[09:41.560 --> 09:46.160]  So that's going to make the EC go up and the pH are going up because it doesn't seem like
[09:46.160 --> 09:49.800]  you're losing a lot of water, but over a couple of days you're probably evaporating a little
[09:49.800 --> 09:53.880]  bit of water, especially if you've got bubbles in there because the bubbles are adding a
[09:53.880 --> 09:57.840]  lot of oxygen to that and putting the, uh, the water into the air and giving it more
[09:57.840 --> 10:02.480]  opportunity to become a vapor and humidity into the room.
[10:02.480 --> 10:05.320]  So what I really think is happening here is just the water is evaporating.
[10:05.320 --> 10:08.520]  It's making your pH rise because there's still salts remaining.
[10:08.520 --> 10:09.520]  There's less water.
[10:09.520 --> 10:10.680]  The ratio has changed.
[10:10.680 --> 10:12.280]  That's throwing off your pH.
[10:12.280 --> 10:17.840]  The way to fix that is just keep monitor monitoring that pH and if it gets lower out of your range,
[10:17.840 --> 10:22.960]  add a little bit of water on that water should bring the pH down right where you wanted it.
[10:22.960 --> 10:24.760]  You may need to add a little bit of pH down.
[10:24.760 --> 10:26.640]  That may also be the solution.
[10:26.640 --> 10:30.280]  So definitely consider checking the EC or the PPMs while you're doing this.
[10:30.280 --> 10:32.400]  They may need to be adjusted as well.
[10:32.400 --> 10:36.200]  All right, my friend, Polly Two Fingers, I feel like I've answered your question.
[10:36.200 --> 10:37.720]  Thank you for the great question.

[11:31.400 --> 11:33.320]  I've got a lot of messages here in front of me.
[11:33.320 --> 11:35.680]  I've got a big stack of messages in the office.
[11:35.680 --> 11:37.480]  I am trying to work my way through the pile.
[11:37.480 --> 11:39.120]  They are in no particular order.
[11:39.120 --> 11:43.120]  I kind of give them a proofread and say this show, next show, this show, next show.
[11:43.120 --> 11:44.520]  That's as far as I go.
[11:44.520 --> 11:47.200]  Let's stay focused because I've got another one for this show.
[11:47.200 --> 11:51.720]  The next message on this episode came from our friend Dave Skylark.
[11:51.720 --> 11:53.560]  Big shout out to my buddy Dave Skylark.
[11:53.560 --> 11:55.020]  Thank you for the great message.
[11:55.020 --> 11:56.680]  This one did come from the grow help tab.
[11:56.680 --> 12:00.760]  So my buddy Dave, you do win a free pack of iRegenetic seeds sponsored by our friends
[12:00.760 --> 12:02.680]  at seedsherenow.com.
[12:02.680 --> 12:04.400]  Please do send me your mailing address.
[12:04.400 --> 12:07.180]  I'd be happy to send you out a package of seeds.
[12:07.180 --> 12:09.200]  This question goes a lot like this.
[12:09.200 --> 12:12.200]  It says, yo Rasta Jeff, I hope you are doing amazing.
[12:12.200 --> 12:13.820]  I feel like I'm doing quite well, bro.
[12:13.820 --> 12:14.820]  Thank you for asking.
[12:14.820 --> 12:18.440]  It says, I definitely look forward to testing out the many strains you offer.
[12:18.440 --> 12:20.440]  I am a huge sativa fan.
[12:20.640 --> 12:24.320]  Oh, you're definitely going to enjoy my products if you like sativas.
[12:24.320 --> 12:27.080]  I like that head wrecking, head tripping buzz.
[12:27.080 --> 12:31.600]  If I can walk into Target and not have a panic attack, I did not get high enough before we
[12:31.600 --> 12:32.600]  went into Target.
[12:32.600 --> 12:34.760]  I need to go take a couple of more dabs.
[12:34.760 --> 12:37.600]  But let's stay focused, which is hard for me today.
[12:37.600 --> 12:43.080]  It says, I'm just curious, what are your thoughts on predator bugs versus chemical or organic
[12:43.080 --> 12:46.680]  sprays for when pests show up, possibly indoors?
[12:46.680 --> 12:49.960]  I haven't ran into pests yet, but it's best to be prepared.
[12:49.960 --> 12:53.960]  Yes, because now that you've said you have not ran into pests, guess what?
[12:53.960 --> 12:54.960]  They're coming.
[12:54.960 --> 12:57.160]  You've invited them by saying that.
[12:57.160 --> 13:00.200]  It goes on, it says, I would love to hear this on an episode of the podcast.
[13:00.200 --> 13:01.200]  Well, here you go, bro.
[13:01.200 --> 13:02.360]  It is on the podcast.
[13:02.360 --> 13:03.720]  It is happening, bro.
[13:03.720 --> 13:06.200]  It wraps it up with, thank you so much.
[13:06.200 --> 13:08.860]  My buddy Dave Skylark, thank you so much for the great question.
[13:08.860 --> 13:10.960]  This is a very good question.
[13:10.960 --> 13:16.840]  How do I feel about predator bugs versus chemical or organic sprays indoors?
[13:16.840 --> 13:22.440]  I actually use a combination of sprayed pesticide applications and predator insects in a commercial
[13:22.440 --> 13:23.640]  grow environment.
[13:23.640 --> 13:29.200]  I don't do it as much in a personal grow because there's not as much at stake in a personal
[13:29.200 --> 13:30.200]  grow.
[13:30.200 --> 13:34.380]  In a commercial grow, there are millions of dollars at risk, at stake per harvest.
[13:34.380 --> 13:36.880]  In a personal grow, it's not as much.
[13:36.880 --> 13:39.200]  The predator bugs get a little bit expensive.
[13:39.200 --> 13:41.040]  The budget is better for the commercial grow.
[13:41.040 --> 13:42.740]  It's more worth it, more worthwhile.
[13:42.740 --> 13:44.840]  Let me delve into what I'm talking about here.
[13:44.840 --> 13:49.440]  In a commercial grow, I like to start with spray applications, just basic sprays.
[13:49.440 --> 13:53.040]  Evergreen, or what's the other one that I like to use in the commercial grow?
[13:53.040 --> 13:56.120]  Evergreen's my favorite go-to most of the time for a preventative.
[13:56.120 --> 13:58.240]  I probably talk about that one a lot.
[13:58.240 --> 14:01.440]  Azitrol, I think, is still allowed in the commercial grow environment.
[14:01.440 --> 14:02.640]  Venerate is still allowed.
[14:02.640 --> 14:07.440]  I like to use products like that as just a basic inner rotation for my basic integrated
[14:07.440 --> 14:08.800]  pest management system.
[14:08.800 --> 14:11.880]  We're going to talk a lot about pest management in another future episode.
[14:11.880 --> 14:14.400]  I'm going to do a full episode about it.
[14:14.400 --> 14:16.560]  I like to spray those products through veg.
[14:16.560 --> 14:19.560]  I like to spray those products right at the beginning of flower.
[14:19.560 --> 14:24.280]  But as soon as I have flower formations, I don't want to apply any more sprayed pesticides.
[14:24.280 --> 14:26.640]  I don't want to mess up the flowers in any way.
[14:26.640 --> 14:28.320]  I don't want to slow down their growth.
[14:28.320 --> 14:29.840]  I don't want to mess up the flavor.
[14:29.840 --> 14:32.960]  I don't want to do any damage to those flowers once they start developing.
[14:32.960 --> 14:35.720]  I just want big, fat, healthy flower clusters.
[14:35.720 --> 14:40.960]  So I need some way to stop bugs from attacking that grow once I stop using those spray applications
[14:41.080 --> 14:44.760]  because some of the grows that I work with in the Colorado area, they're in the middle
[14:44.760 --> 14:49.160]  of basically the middle of the desert and there are bugs out there and there are bushes
[14:49.160 --> 14:53.080]  out there and we can't, uh, we can only do so much to the outside environment and the
[14:53.080 --> 14:54.960]  building is only so sealed.
[14:54.960 --> 14:56.320]  So bugs are able to get in.
[14:56.320 --> 14:59.800]  So I've got to do things to make sure they cannot get to my plants.
[14:59.800 --> 15:03.920]  So once I have hit the threshold that I feel like my plants are too beefy and too chunky
[15:03.920 --> 15:09.360]  to apply a spray pesticide, that is when I begin to release large batches of predator
[15:09.360 --> 15:10.360]  insects.
[15:10.360 --> 15:15.200]  Now there's a very large variety of predator insects you can release in a cultivation facility
[15:15.200 --> 15:19.160]  to eliminate bugs, eradicate bugs, keep bugs at bay.
[15:19.160 --> 15:22.240]  You can get rid of almost any insect with other insects.
[15:22.240 --> 15:24.480]  You just may have to be aggressive about it.
[15:24.480 --> 15:26.320]  It's all about a numbers game.
[15:26.320 --> 15:29.240]  Also just like pesticides, it's just as important.
[15:29.240 --> 15:33.680]  When I use a pesticide, my first question is what bugs are we trying to attack?
[15:33.680 --> 15:34.960]  What pest is coming?
[15:34.960 --> 15:36.240]  What am I spraying for?
[15:36.240 --> 15:41.600]  Because if you're fighting guys with AK 47s, you don't want to send in karate guys.
[15:41.600 --> 15:42.600]  That's not going to work.
[15:42.600 --> 15:45.760]  You've got to send in guys with fucking missile launchers to take them out.
[15:45.760 --> 15:48.720]  You've got to know what you're battling so that you can win.
[15:48.720 --> 15:53.280]  The same thing applies for attacking a pest problem with another pest.
[15:53.280 --> 15:54.600]  You need the appropriate pests.
[15:54.600 --> 15:57.080]  You have to do your research on that part.
[15:57.080 --> 16:01.120]  Also it is very environmental and regionally dependent.
[16:01.120 --> 16:04.720]  Some pests, some of your predator bugs will not stick around if your humidity is too high
[16:04.720 --> 16:06.220]  or too low.
[16:06.220 --> 16:09.700]  Some of the predators will not stick around if the temperature is too high or too low.
[16:09.700 --> 16:14.100]  So you've got to find the bugs that work for your environment and attack the pest you are
[16:14.100 --> 16:15.860]  trying to eradicate.
[16:15.860 --> 16:20.180]  Now to some people, it may sound crazy that I'm going to apply sprays and then release
[16:20.180 --> 16:22.460]  bugs, but I'm going to time it properly.
[16:22.460 --> 16:27.060]  I'm going to spray all the way up to about day 10 of flower, and then I'm going to stop
[16:27.060 --> 16:28.060]  spraying.
[16:28.060 --> 16:31.700]  Then we're going to do a heavy defoliation one last time, and we're going to order the
[16:31.700 --> 16:32.700]  insects.
[16:32.700 --> 16:34.740]  The bugs will show up about day 14 or 15.
[16:34.740 --> 16:36.780]  Then we'll release all of those bugs.
[16:36.780 --> 16:40.900]  By this time, all of the sprayed pesticide applications have broken down.
[16:40.900 --> 16:44.140]  They've been broken down by the light, by the wind, and they are no longer going to
[16:44.140 --> 16:47.460]  be a problem for the incoming predator bugs.
[16:47.460 --> 16:50.700]  So I will spray all through veg once or twice a week.
[16:50.700 --> 16:52.820]  If I see, I spray once a week no matter what.
[16:52.820 --> 16:54.900]  And then if I see a problem, we step it up.
[16:54.900 --> 16:55.900]  We spray twice a week.
[16:55.900 --> 17:00.020]  If I still see problems, then I really need to step my shit up because I am failing twice
[17:00.020 --> 17:03.540]  a week should get the job done no matter what bugs I'm facing.
[17:03.540 --> 17:04.860]  Again I will taper off the sprays.
[17:04.860 --> 17:10.420]  If I don't see any problems as we go into flower, taper off the sprays, do another defoliation,
[17:10.420 --> 17:11.880]  and release the predator bugs.
[17:11.880 --> 17:14.780]  Those bugs are going to work like an army, like security guards.
[17:14.780 --> 17:16.380]  They're going to get in there hungry.
[17:16.380 --> 17:18.100]  When they come in the mail, they are hungry, bro.
[17:18.100 --> 17:20.780]  When those bugs show up, they are ready to fucking go.
[17:20.780 --> 17:22.340]  So release those strategically.
[17:22.340 --> 17:23.900]  Spread them out through the canopy.
[17:23.900 --> 17:27.260]  If you've got a hot spot of bugs you're trying to get rid of, focus some of your bugs on
[17:27.260 --> 17:29.340]  that hot spot and get rid of those bugs.
[17:29.340 --> 17:30.340]  They will come in.
[17:30.340 --> 17:32.220]  They will start eating the shit out of the bad guys.
[17:32.220 --> 17:33.220]  They will take over.
[17:33.900 --> 17:34.900]  They will colonize.
[17:34.900 --> 17:37.620]  And then once all of your pests are gone, basically all of your good bugs will die too
[17:37.620 --> 17:39.620]  if they don't have a food source.
[17:39.620 --> 17:43.300]  You can feed them if you like or you can let them dwindle off and die.
[17:43.300 --> 17:46.940]  A lot of times if we have extra bugs from the flower rooms, I will go put some of those
[17:46.940 --> 17:50.660]  in the mom room because I do believe that the mother room is where it all starts.
[17:50.660 --> 17:53.540]  If you don't have healthy moms, you can't have healthy clones.
[17:53.540 --> 17:55.220]  Then you can't have healthy veg.
[17:55.220 --> 17:56.500]  You'll never have healthy flowers.
[17:56.500 --> 18:01.160]  So I'll go spread some of those in the mom room just to give that mom room a little bonus,
[18:01.160 --> 18:02.340]  get some predator bugs in there.
[18:02.460 --> 18:03.620]  And that way they're already started.
[18:03.620 --> 18:06.020]  They're colonizing in there and we can move them around.
[18:06.020 --> 18:09.300]  Yes, perhaps a lot of them are going to get destroyed by pesticide applications in the
[18:09.300 --> 18:13.460]  future, but they're like little backup guardians for the time that they do survive.
[18:13.460 --> 18:14.460]  All right.
[18:14.460 --> 18:17.340]  My friend, Dave Skylark, thank you for the great question.
[18:17.340 --> 18:18.540]  I do appreciate it.
[18:18.540 --> 18:22.340]  My method, use those sprayed applications right up until the last minute, then switch
[18:22.340 --> 18:23.620]  to those bugs.
[18:23.620 --> 18:26.420]  If you do want to use bugs the whole way, let me talk about that.
[18:26.420 --> 18:32.320]  You definitely can use predator bugs the entire time through the growth cycle if you don't
[18:32.320 --> 18:34.600]  want to add spray applications.
[18:34.600 --> 18:38.960]  And there are some spray applications that will not harm beneficial insects.
[18:38.960 --> 18:41.900]  They will keep some of your beneficial predator bugs around.
[18:41.900 --> 18:43.840]  You do need to do the research on that.
[18:43.840 --> 18:47.680]  If you're going to spray something, read, will it kill hypoaspis miles?
[18:47.680 --> 18:49.280]  Will it kill green lacewings?
[18:49.280 --> 18:53.400]  See because some of your applications are only going to kill the insects that bite into
[18:53.400 --> 18:54.400]  the leaf.
[18:54.400 --> 18:55.520]  And some of these guys don't bite into the leaf.
[18:55.520 --> 18:56.920]  They just crawl around on it.
[18:56.920 --> 19:01.320]  So you may be able to spray some applications even after you do release the predators.
[19:01.320 --> 19:05.800]  Once again, you'll have to do your research for specific predators and specific sprays,
[19:05.800 --> 19:11.800]  but you definitely can use the predator bugs through the entire duration of the grow.
[19:11.800 --> 19:15.000]  Once again, I will list off some more because I think I went through them quite quickly
[19:15.000 --> 19:16.480]  a moment ago.
[19:16.480 --> 19:23.580]  There's the californicus or the swarski, the hypoaspis miles, the green lacewings.
[19:23.580 --> 19:27.720]  There's another one that I just cannot think of right now that is voracious.
[19:28.720 --> 19:31.960]  Yeah, the minute pirate bug is definitely a hungry little bastard.
[19:31.960 --> 19:34.080]  I like the green lacewing eggs.
[19:34.080 --> 19:35.200]  They come on little cars.
[19:35.200 --> 19:39.600]  They hatch and they turn into these little, it looks like a little microscopic crocodile.
[19:39.600 --> 19:40.760]  Those guys are hungry as shit.
[19:40.760 --> 19:43.560]  They will eat the shit out of all of the bugs in your garden.
[19:43.560 --> 19:46.520]  I recommend not to waste your time with ladybugs.
[19:46.520 --> 19:49.400]  A lot of people are going to say, just buy ladybugs and release those.
[19:49.400 --> 19:50.840]  Nah, bro.
[19:50.840 --> 19:53.400]  Ladybugs are fucking lazy compared to more aggressive bugs.
[19:53.400 --> 19:55.320]  There are much more aggressive predators out there.
[19:55.320 --> 19:59.360]  If you're going to pay money, you want to get the good shit, get the aggressive bugs,
[19:59.360 --> 20:01.240]  the bugs I mentioned before.
[20:01.240 --> 20:07.280]  And also ladybugs, for every thousand ladybugs you release, I think 500 of them fly into
[20:07.280 --> 20:10.640]  the lights, into the ducting, into the blowers and get, they're suicidal.
[20:10.640 --> 20:13.120]  They kamikaze themselves right the fuck away.
[20:13.120 --> 20:15.160]  The ladybugs are really cool for about 30 minutes.
[20:15.160 --> 20:17.080]  You get them in there, take a bunch of photos.
[20:17.080 --> 20:18.080]  Oh, ladybugs.
[20:18.080 --> 20:19.080]  Cool.
[20:19.080 --> 20:20.080]  They're everywhere.
[20:20.080 --> 20:22.120]  And then the next day it smells like shit because they stink so bad.
[20:22.120 --> 20:25.120]  You walk into the grow and it sounds like you're walking on crunchy popcorn because there's
[20:25.920 --> 20:27.920]  dead ladybugs on the floor and you're just busting them.
[20:27.920 --> 20:28.920]  I don't like the ladybugs.
[20:28.920 --> 20:30.480]  I think I made my point on that.
[20:30.480 --> 20:33.720]  I'm Rasta Jeff and I vote no on ladybugs in the grow.
[20:33.720 --> 20:35.280]  Use a more aggressive predator.
[20:35.280 --> 20:36.280]  That's my stance on shit.
[20:36.280 --> 20:37.280]  All right.
[20:37.280 --> 20:38.280]  Where are we on time?
[20:38.280 --> 20:40.240]  I think we've got time for one more question here.
[20:40.240 --> 20:42.380]  Also, did I say this already?
[20:42.380 --> 20:43.520]  My dude, Dave Skylark.
[20:43.520 --> 20:44.520]  Yes, I said this.
[20:44.520 --> 20:48.720]  Please do reach out because I owe you a free pack of Irie Genetics seeds.
[20:48.720 --> 20:49.800]  All right.
[20:49.800 --> 20:55.060]  This next message once again came from the contact form submission on Irie Direct.
[20:56.000 --> 20:56.840]  This one came from our friend Greg.
[20:56.840 --> 20:57.840]  Big shout out to my buddy Greg.
[20:57.840 --> 20:59.540]  I don't know if you want your full name said here, buddy.
[20:59.540 --> 21:00.700]  You wrote your full name.
[21:00.700 --> 21:02.240]  I'm just going to call you Greg today.
[21:02.240 --> 21:03.780]  Big shout out to my buddy Greg.
[21:03.780 --> 21:08.660]  Greg says, I want to know what strains you have that are powdery mildew resistant.
[21:08.660 --> 21:09.700]  That is a really good question.
[21:09.700 --> 21:12.780]  A lot of people are going to be growing outdoors this year.
[21:12.780 --> 21:17.980]  A lot of people on the coastal areas are always looking for that mold and mildew resistant
[21:17.980 --> 21:18.980]  strain.
[21:18.980 --> 21:21.420]  A lot of people have been asking me this lately because they are going outdoors.
[21:21.420 --> 21:23.760]  I have got some recommendations for you.
[21:23.760 --> 21:24.760]  Have no fear.
[21:25.460 --> 21:26.460]  Life has got answers.
[21:26.460 --> 21:30.040]  One of the strains I can recommend to you that has been proven to be very resistant
[21:30.040 --> 21:34.480]  to powdery mildew in indoor and outdoor environments is Morning Dew.
[21:34.480 --> 21:36.280]  Morning Dew is one of my favorite strains.
[21:36.280 --> 21:39.320]  That is a grateful dog pollinated by an arise plant.
[21:39.320 --> 21:41.880]  I made both of those plants and then I bred them together.
[21:41.880 --> 21:44.040]  That is one of my favorite creations.
[21:44.040 --> 21:50.160]  The Morning Dew makes a skunky, chemically cushy sort of aromas and flavors with a really
[21:50.160 --> 21:51.160]  nice buzz.
[21:51.160 --> 21:52.160]  That one is Morning Dew.
[21:52.560 --> 21:56.080]  That one is going to be very powdery mildew resistant.
[21:56.080 --> 21:58.520]  The next one is Character Zero.
[21:58.520 --> 22:00.160]  Character Zero is an afterglow cross.
[22:00.160 --> 22:06.760]  A lot of the afterglow crosses that I made about a year ago, those crosses are all very
[22:06.760 --> 22:08.240]  powdery mildew resistant.
[22:08.240 --> 22:13.000]  But some of the standout crosses in that lineup were the Character Zero and the Sunday Show.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.080]  Those are both very powdery mildew resistant.
[22:16.080 --> 22:21.280]  Those both have a very specific, very special plant in there which is a Nigerian Cross II
[22:21.280 --> 22:23.640]  and an Afghani Cross II and a Nepali.
[22:23.640 --> 22:26.600]  I'm surprised and glad that I remembered all of that.
[22:26.600 --> 22:30.800]  Everything that comes from that plant that is crossed to that plant does make very powdery
[22:30.800 --> 22:33.600]  mildew resistant plants.
[22:33.600 --> 22:36.640]  That plant was crossed to the afterglow.
[22:36.640 --> 22:40.360]  That plant was also crossed to the Fire OG and then crossed to the afterglow.
[22:40.360 --> 22:44.720]  Both of those offspring create very powdery mildew resistant plants.
[22:44.720 --> 22:48.040]  Once again, those are the Character Zero and Sunday Show.
[22:48.040 --> 22:51.040]  I've got one more for you that we're going to talk about here that is very powdery mildew
[22:51.080 --> 22:53.880]  resistant and that one is called Fist Bump.
[22:53.880 --> 22:57.360]  Fist Bump is sour diesel to a rise.
[22:57.360 --> 22:59.080]  That one is super stinky.
[22:59.080 --> 23:04.360]  It's got a super sour diesel chemical, dirty feet, sort of a funky thing to it and the
[23:04.360 --> 23:05.800]  buzz on it is amazing.
[23:05.800 --> 23:09.520]  It'll make your eyes nice and heavy, make you nice and red-eyed, give you that old school
[23:09.520 --> 23:12.320]  cotton mouth and the flavor is just right.
[23:12.320 --> 23:17.720]  So some options for powdery mildew resistant strains from my lineup, I would say Morning
[23:17.720 --> 23:18.720]  Dew.
[23:18.720 --> 23:22.680]  Morning Dew is regular seeds by the way, male, female seeds.
[23:22.680 --> 23:26.280]  The Character Zero and Sunday Show are two more recommendations.
[23:26.280 --> 23:31.400]  Those are feminized seeds and my final recommendation for you was Fist Bump and that is regular
[23:31.400 --> 23:33.000]  seeds.
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.200]  My friend Greg, I do thank you for the great question.
[23:35.200 --> 23:37.440]  I hope I answered your question thoroughly.
