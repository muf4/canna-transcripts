[00:00.000 --> 00:18.480]  All right, here we go.
[00:18.480 --> 00:20.160]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:20.160 --> 00:27.200]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 696 of the Grow From Your
[00:27.200 --> 00:28.860]  Heart Podcast.
[00:28.860 --> 00:33.120]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on another breeding question before I get to that part
[00:33.120 --> 00:34.180]  of the show.
[00:34.180 --> 00:38.740]  Let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who continue to support the show
[00:38.740 --> 00:40.340]  on Patreon.
[00:40.340 --> 00:44.300]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to my friend

[01:17.020 --> 01:20.660]  to our friend Groove2112.
[01:20.660 --> 01:25.600]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:25.640 --> 01:29.280]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:29.280 --> 01:35.640]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:35.640 --> 01:39.400]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen and you know I do include
[01:39.400 --> 01:43.940]  a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all
[01:43.940 --> 01:44.940]  of my friends.
[01:44.940 --> 01:48.200]  All right, let's not waste too much time here at the start of the show.
[01:48.200 --> 01:51.380]  Let's jump right into some of the emails that our friends have sent us.
[01:51.380 --> 01:54.080]  This one comes from our friend Maritime Grower.
[01:54.080 --> 01:55.800]  It goes a little bit like this.
[01:55.800 --> 02:01.440]  It says, my question is, so far I'm very impressed with the Golden Goat BX I have received.
[02:01.440 --> 02:05.680]  Everything is working out great, but I need to look at expanding my selection.
[02:05.680 --> 02:08.120]  Yes, that is very a grower thing.
[02:08.120 --> 02:11.380]  Once you get good at growing a plant and you have fun with it, you realize I want to grow
[02:11.380 --> 02:15.120]  something different, grow more, get more experiences, more flavors.
[02:15.120 --> 02:16.120]  That is how it goes.
[02:16.120 --> 02:19.580]  Then you end up filling a room with a bunch of great shit.
[02:19.580 --> 02:21.240]  Growing is so much fun.
[02:21.240 --> 02:22.840]  I get so passionate about growing.
[02:22.840 --> 02:23.960]  I can't get enough plants.
[02:24.040 --> 02:25.040]  I can't grow enough plants.
[02:25.040 --> 02:27.360]  I just want to grow, smoke, try it all.
[02:27.360 --> 02:29.880]  Let me try to get myself back on track.
[02:29.880 --> 02:32.200]  It says, I'm a big fan of sour diesel.
[02:32.200 --> 02:35.520]  I mean, it's probably my favorite strain to date.
[02:35.520 --> 02:40.120]  I've been stoned for over 30 years on all different types of weed.
[02:40.120 --> 02:45.800]  A lot of us that have been smoking for a long time love the sour diesel, the chem, the kush.
[02:45.800 --> 02:51.000]  Those are three distinct flavors and aromas and classes of cannabis that we all enjoy.
[02:51.040 --> 02:52.200]  I totally agree with you.
[02:52.200 --> 02:57.280]  That sour diesel, that diesel terp, the buzz, the flavor, the aroma, everything about it
[02:57.280 --> 02:58.280]  is highly desirable.
[02:58.280 --> 03:02.320]  When you got a bag of a good sour diesel in your pocket, you get in the car with a friend
[03:02.320 --> 03:03.920]  and they're like, oh dude, you brought the diesel.
[03:03.920 --> 03:05.320]  They know right away.
[03:05.320 --> 03:08.940]  The whole neighborhood knows right away when you roll a joint and smoke that shit.
[03:08.940 --> 03:11.240]  Good sour diesel is amazing.
[03:11.240 --> 03:13.000]  I understand why it's one of your favorites.
[03:13.000 --> 03:14.000]  It stands out.
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.440]  Like I said, it's got its own category, that gas, that diesel flavor.
[03:17.440 --> 03:18.880]  That's its own thing.
[03:18.880 --> 03:23.040]  It says, what strain would you say would be close to that?
[03:23.040 --> 03:27.160]  I've been growing different strains for six years looking for something like this.
[03:27.160 --> 03:33.200]  And since after 650 plus podcasts, I feel that you, your genetics and knowledge can
[03:33.200 --> 03:34.800]  help with this.
[03:34.800 --> 03:35.800]  Thanks in advance.
[03:35.800 --> 03:37.340]  Keep it up and growers love.
[03:37.340 --> 03:41.680]  Of course, that was from our friend Maritime Grower there.
[03:41.680 --> 03:43.300]  Thank you for the great message.
[03:43.300 --> 03:44.300]  Thank you for the nostalgia.
[03:44.300 --> 03:49.100]  When I read the message about the sour diesel, I could smell the diesel the way that it used
[03:49.100 --> 03:52.860]  to make my, it would make my smoke room.
[03:52.860 --> 03:54.260]  I think it was my bedroom back in the day.
[03:54.260 --> 03:57.100]  It would make that room stink so good.
[03:57.100 --> 04:01.160]  I remembered how when I would get a large quantity of it, maybe allegedly I had a friend
[04:01.160 --> 04:05.020]  that was growing a lot of it and I would get a large quantity and it would make the whole
[04:05.020 --> 04:07.060]  house smell funky.
[04:07.060 --> 04:10.340]  When you would drive with it in the car, you'd be, I would be so paranoid.
[04:10.340 --> 04:14.300]  It was like a gassy skunk, dirty diesel fuel sort of a thing.
[04:14.300 --> 04:16.540]  It kind of burns my eyes in a delightful way.
[04:16.540 --> 04:20.740]  The buzz gives me tunnel vision to where all I can focus on is what's right in front of
[04:20.740 --> 04:23.420]  me and I can't even barely pay attention to that.
[04:23.420 --> 04:25.900]  I love good sour diesel stuff.
[04:25.900 --> 04:31.780]  Now the question here is, what strain would you say would be close to that?
[04:31.780 --> 04:34.340]  I would like to make a lot of recommendations.
[04:34.340 --> 04:39.340]  Unfortunately, there's nothing like real true, real deal sour diesel.
[04:39.340 --> 04:40.340]  There's nothing like that.
[04:40.340 --> 04:45.580]  So I can't make a recommendation for anything from my line currently that I would say would
[04:45.580 --> 04:47.420]  be real deal true diesel.
[04:47.420 --> 04:50.540]  I don't want to mislead you, lie to you, give you the wrong information.
[04:50.540 --> 04:55.620]  I may allegedly have crossed something with a diesel plant, but it needs to be tested.
[04:55.620 --> 04:56.660]  We need to see what it does.
[04:56.660 --> 04:57.660]  It's still brand new.
[04:57.660 --> 04:58.660]  It's just happened.
[04:58.660 --> 05:01.040]  It hasn't had time to be ran at all.
[05:01.040 --> 05:02.040]  That is in testing.
[05:02.040 --> 05:06.640]  But being a good friend, somebody that wants to make sure you get what you're looking for,
[05:06.640 --> 05:12.520]  our friend JJ from Top Dog has been putting out sour diesel BX3 and I've got a pack of
[05:12.520 --> 05:13.520]  them.
[05:13.520 --> 05:16.440]  I do intend to maybe select a male out of those in the future.
[05:16.440 --> 05:21.440]  I don't have room to run them right now, but if you are looking for high quality sour diesel
[05:21.440 --> 05:25.000]  seeds right now, to the best of my knowledge, there may be more out there.
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.760]  I'm not dissing any other breeder.
[05:26.760 --> 05:29.520]  I'm giving love to the breeder that I know does have it.
[05:29.520 --> 05:35.680]  JJ Top Dog Genetics does have the real deal sour diesel BX3.
[05:35.720 --> 05:40.240]  Make sure if you are looking for JJ, if you're looking for Top Dog, follow the appropriate
[05:40.240 --> 05:43.320]  page on Instagram if you are following them on social media.
[05:43.320 --> 05:45.160]  I'm going to sidetrack here.
[05:45.160 --> 05:49.160]  On social media right now, there are a lot of fake accounts posing as your favorite seed
[05:49.160 --> 05:52.480]  makers, seed breeders, seed vendors.
[05:52.480 --> 05:56.680]  You'll notice if you pay close attention, their account is just one letter off.
[05:56.680 --> 05:59.160]  So I'm talking about Top Dog right now.
[05:59.160 --> 06:02.420]  Top Dog is Top, T-O-P-D-A-W-G.
[06:02.420 --> 06:06.260]  They may put two W's in the Top Dog and you may not even notice that.
[06:06.260 --> 06:08.220]  Or they may throw an underscore in a weird place.
[06:08.220 --> 06:10.340]  I read underscore genetics as me.
[06:10.340 --> 06:12.820]  I read dot genetics as not me.
[06:12.820 --> 06:17.660]  So people on Instagram right now are really trying to scam people who are looking to buy
[06:17.660 --> 06:18.660]  seeds.
[06:18.660 --> 06:22.180]  If a breeder posts a photo and then somebody says, hey, where can I find this?
[06:22.180 --> 06:25.380]  There is a scammer that follows up right away and says, hey, I've got it.
[06:25.380 --> 06:26.440]  Message me here.
[06:26.440 --> 06:28.740]  And those most likely are not the breeders.
[06:28.740 --> 06:31.660]  We're not really, the breeders don't do a lot of sales online.
[06:31.900 --> 06:35.940]  I can't speak for everybody, but most of the breeders do their sales through the vendors.
[06:35.940 --> 06:37.300]  Most of us have a website.
[06:37.300 --> 06:38.620]  You can hit the website.
[06:38.620 --> 06:42.300]  There is a recommended or a, it is a suggested vendor list.
[06:42.300 --> 06:44.100]  Those people have been tried and true.
[06:44.100 --> 06:46.860]  We know they've been vetted is the word my brain is searching for.
[06:46.860 --> 06:47.980]  We know those are good vendors.
[06:47.980 --> 06:50.780]  We know they will not rip you off, burn you, scam you.
[06:50.780 --> 06:53.100]  We know the seeds that they send you came from us.
[06:53.100 --> 06:57.620]  So make sure you're checking out the real social media pages and that you are following
[06:57.620 --> 07:01.380]  the real social media and that you are getting seeds from reliable sources.
[07:01.380 --> 07:02.980]  Let me try to figure out where I was.
[07:02.980 --> 07:05.460]  Sour Diesel from JJ.
[07:05.460 --> 07:08.740]  If you're looking for the Sour Diesel, I highly recommend JJ.
[07:08.740 --> 07:09.740]  That's a good cross.
[07:09.740 --> 07:10.740]  That's a good dude.
[07:10.740 --> 07:11.740]  He's a New Yorker.
[07:11.740 --> 07:17.560]  I would trust and believe that that's the real deal OG Sour Diesel.
[07:17.560 --> 07:20.500]  Get a pack of those seeds before warned.
[07:20.500 --> 07:23.220]  They are not the cheapest seeds on the planet.
[07:23.220 --> 07:26.460]  I'm not talking trash about AJ's prices or JJ's prices.
[07:26.460 --> 07:27.460]  I apologize for that.
[07:27.460 --> 07:31.100]  When I think in diesel, I think AJ, that's a whole nother, if anybody knows why you understand
[07:31.820 --> 07:33.620]  AJ's Sour Diesel is why.
[07:33.620 --> 07:36.640]  But JJ will charge you a little bit for those seeds.
[07:36.640 --> 07:40.420]  But if you find that Sour Diesel that you're looking for, it is worth it.
[07:40.420 --> 07:42.180]  You do pay for a premium product.
[07:42.180 --> 07:43.180]  Expect that.
[07:43.180 --> 07:47.340]  I'm warning you, no disrespect to the people charging a top dollar for their product out
[07:47.340 --> 07:48.340]  there.
[07:48.340 --> 07:49.340]  Charge what you want.
[07:49.340 --> 07:51.900]  But to you customers that are going to go look right now, be ready.
[07:51.900 --> 07:53.860]  It's not super cheap.
[07:53.860 --> 07:54.860]  Be prepared.
[07:54.860 --> 07:55.860]  All right.
[07:55.860 --> 07:58.660]  So the Sour Diesel, I would recommend that you get the Sour Diesel BX.
[07:58.700 --> 08:05.180]  I think it's a BX3, a bat cross number three from our friend Top Dog Genetics, Top Dog
[08:05.180 --> 08:06.180]  Seeds.
[08:06.180 --> 08:07.180]  All right.
[08:07.180 --> 08:10.060]  And once again, make sure you guys are supporting the correct social media page.
[08:10.060 --> 08:14.260]  Unfortunately, we did have a friend, I'm not going to say any names, but a friend was scammed
[08:14.260 --> 08:16.580]  out of a nice portion of money.
[08:16.580 --> 08:18.740]  Somebody on social media was claiming to be iRegenetics.
[08:18.740 --> 08:21.060]  Unfortunately, that was a fake account.
[08:21.060 --> 08:22.540]  I saw them on a live feed.
[08:22.540 --> 08:23.740]  They said, hey, did you send my package?
[08:23.740 --> 08:26.220]  And I was like, I didn't send any package.
[08:26.220 --> 08:30.020]  I politely went and we did some messaging and then they sent me screenshots.
[08:30.020 --> 08:31.220]  Somebody was pretending to be me.
[08:31.220 --> 08:32.220]  That wasn't me.
[08:32.220 --> 08:35.020]  So be very careful if you're purchasing seeds out there, you guys.
[08:35.020 --> 08:36.220]  Check the email address.
[08:36.220 --> 08:38.100]  Check the social media account.
[08:38.100 --> 08:42.660]  Double check your dots, your dashes, underscores.
[08:42.660 --> 08:43.980]  Make sure you're messing with the right person.
[08:43.980 --> 08:44.980]  All right.
[08:44.980 --> 08:49.440]  To my friend Maritime Grower, I wish I had more advice for you, but I don't have something
[08:49.440 --> 08:53.860]  in my line that is reliably Sour Diesel that's going to give you that nostalgia.
[08:53.860 --> 08:55.800]  I don't want to mislead you, lie to you.
[08:55.800 --> 08:59.280]  But I do know that it's available via Top Dog Genetics.
[08:59.280 --> 09:00.280]  Thank you for the great message, brother.
[09:00.280 --> 09:05.880]  I do look forward to seeing pictures of your grow of the Sour Diesel when you do obtain
[09:05.880 --> 09:06.880]  those seeds.
[09:06.880 --> 09:09.760]  Obtain, acquire, score when you get them, bro.
[09:09.760 --> 09:10.760]  I look forward to the pictures.
[09:10.760 --> 09:11.760]  All right.
[09:11.760 --> 09:15.760]  I do have one more message here before we get to the breeding part of this podcast.
[09:15.760 --> 09:18.580]  This message came from The Man With No Name.
[09:18.580 --> 09:22.400]  It says, hey, I love the podcast and the plants you put out, bro.
[09:22.400 --> 09:23.400]  Thank you.
[09:23.400 --> 09:24.400]  That is a great compliment.
[09:24.400 --> 09:29.720]  The question is, I have an AC Infinity fan, a six inch AC Infinity fan.
[09:29.720 --> 09:32.000]  I'm using a three by three tent.
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.120]  I use the AC Infinity in my four by four.
[09:35.120 --> 09:40.280]  Currently, I'm having problems with nanners really bad since I got the AC Infinity.
[09:40.280 --> 09:41.280]  Okay.
[09:41.280 --> 09:47.440]  So you're ending up with intersex plants ever since you got that AC Infinity fan.
[09:47.440 --> 09:53.440]  It goes on to say, if the fan outtake is sucking in the sides of the tent, can and will that
[09:53.480 --> 09:54.960]  cause nanners?
[09:54.960 --> 09:58.000]  And by nanners, he means intersex plants from Aphroditic Plants.
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.160]  It says, I have the speed control on the lowest setting.
[10:02.160 --> 10:03.160]  Thank you.
[10:03.160 --> 10:04.960]  And then it talks about some other strains he's grown.
[10:04.960 --> 10:06.920]  Now let's talk about this just briefly.
[10:06.920 --> 10:09.420]  The sides of the tent being sucked in are not a problem.
[10:09.420 --> 10:10.420]  That is negative pressure.
[10:10.420 --> 10:15.640]  If you've got your carbon filter inside the tent, then you're sucking in.
[10:15.640 --> 10:16.960]  It's working very, that's a good thing.
[10:16.960 --> 10:17.960]  Don't worry about that.
[10:17.960 --> 10:18.960]  That's not a problem.
[10:18.960 --> 10:22.240]  And no, that should, will not cause intersex plants.
[10:22.240 --> 10:25.480]  If you've got quality genetics, that should not be the cause.
[10:25.480 --> 10:29.520]  I'm thinking since you've introduced this new fan, there is some sort of a light leak
[10:29.520 --> 10:31.600]  would be my first assumption.
[10:31.600 --> 10:34.000]  I don't know what else got adjusted during this.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.960]  I don't know where the AC Infinity controller is.
[10:36.960 --> 10:40.960]  There are a lot of things that I would investigate, but my very first assumption would be that
[10:40.960 --> 10:44.560]  you have now got a light leak that you have not yet discovered.
[10:44.560 --> 10:47.320]  So I would see where that AC Infinity controller is.
[10:47.320 --> 10:48.520]  Is that inside the tent?
[10:48.520 --> 10:53.280]  If it's in the tent, it is coming on during your night cycle and that is giving you your
[10:53.280 --> 10:55.560]  intersex traits.
[10:55.560 --> 10:58.000]  You've got the new blower.
[10:58.000 --> 10:59.240]  Excuse me for the throat clearing, you guys.
[10:59.240 --> 11:01.920]  I've been dabbing my face off this weekend.
[11:01.920 --> 11:03.600]  You've got that new blower.
[11:03.600 --> 11:04.880]  How is the ducting ran now?
[11:04.880 --> 11:08.360]  Is the ducting going a different direction where you're getting light through the ducting
[11:08.360 --> 11:12.080]  or did you open a flap that wasn't open before?
[11:12.080 --> 11:14.840]  Maybe I just thought of this while I'm talking my way through it.
[11:14.840 --> 11:16.560]  The tent is sucking in on itself.
[11:16.600 --> 11:18.560]  The tents usually have flaps on the bottom.
[11:18.560 --> 11:22.120]  Are they opening up so much that you're allowing light in through the bottom?
[11:22.120 --> 11:27.960]  It's really unlikely, probably not the cause, but my main, if you're getting intersex plants
[11:27.960 --> 11:33.280]  now that you weren't getting before this piece of equipment, I'm going to assume it's a light
[11:33.280 --> 11:34.280]  leak.
[11:34.280 --> 11:36.360]  That is going to be my very first assumption.
[11:36.360 --> 11:40.280]  I actually like to see the walls of the tent suck in a little bit when I'm growing.
[11:40.280 --> 11:44.000]  That lets me know, first of all, it lets me know I'm getting enough suction power.
[11:44.040 --> 11:49.160]  I'm pushing out more air than I'm able to pull in because it's struggling to get air.
[11:49.160 --> 11:51.680]  It's just caving in because so much air is going out.
[11:51.680 --> 11:54.800]  That means that all of the air going out is getting carbon filtered and I'm replacing
[11:54.800 --> 11:59.360]  that air just fucking as quickly as possible as it can be replaced in that tent.
[11:59.360 --> 12:01.160]  I keep making this motion.
[12:01.160 --> 12:04.640]  That's air coming in through the bottom, going up, going through the carbon filter, going
[12:04.640 --> 12:08.280]  out of the ducting, going out of that tent, and then wherever you've got it directed.
[12:08.280 --> 12:11.920]  If it's out of the house, out of into the attic, out of a window, or just back into
[12:11.920 --> 12:14.520]  the room, which could work if you do that properly.
[12:14.520 --> 12:17.800]  If you recondition that air and then blow it back into the tent, that would work for
[12:17.800 --> 12:18.800]  you.
[12:18.800 --> 12:20.280]  Heat rises, lower air is at the bottom.
[12:20.280 --> 12:23.000]  You could figure out how to make that happen for you.
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.720]  But overall, I really don't think that that suction is ever going to cause you intersex
[12:27.720 --> 12:28.720]  traits.
[12:28.720 --> 12:31.000]  I've been doing that sort of a thing in tents for years.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.720]  I don't have any tents running right now, which is kind of weird.
[12:33.720 --> 12:38.040]  I've usually got a tent going somewhere and I always have it kind of sucking in a little
[12:38.040 --> 12:39.040]  bit.
[12:39.040 --> 12:42.840]  But if you slip it, you kind of hear the tent go, oh, I was getting sucked in a lot.
[12:42.840 --> 12:45.760]  I do like that negative pressure is what that is called.
[12:45.760 --> 12:46.760]  So that's not a problem.
[12:46.760 --> 12:47.920]  That shouldn't be causing it.
[12:47.920 --> 12:49.900]  I really, really think it is.
[12:49.900 --> 12:53.720]  If you've ran these plants before and you haven't ran into intersex issues, I'm going
[12:53.720 --> 12:55.560]  to assume there is a light leak.
[12:55.560 --> 13:01.000]  So go in there, go in the tent during your night cycle when the lights should be off.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.360]  Go in the tent if you can, if you can fit in there.
[13:03.360 --> 13:04.360]  I'm 6'5".
[13:04.360 --> 13:06.640]  It's hard as shit for me to go in the tent.
[13:06.640 --> 13:08.000]  But go in the tent.
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.560]  Maybe you can look around during the light cycle and see what's in there.
[13:11.560 --> 13:14.040]  Is there an extension cord that's got a light on it?
[13:14.040 --> 13:15.720]  Is there a piece of equipment that lights up?
[13:15.720 --> 13:16.720]  Do you have a hygrometer?
[13:16.720 --> 13:17.720]  Do you have a thermostat?
[13:17.720 --> 13:21.520]  Do you have any sort of equipment that is in there that's got any kind of lighting on
[13:21.520 --> 13:22.520]  it?
[13:22.520 --> 13:23.520]  Does your dehumidifier have a light on it?
[13:23.520 --> 13:27.800]  Do you have anything in there that is producing any kind of light during the dark cycle?
[13:27.800 --> 13:31.160]  Because I really do believe it is a light leak.
[13:31.160 --> 13:36.440]  So if you can fit in there, if you can stand in that tent, in that space, I wouldn't fit.
[13:36.440 --> 13:39.960]  If you can fit in there, go in there and turn off the lights in the grow space and
[13:39.960 --> 13:43.240]  leave the outside lights however they would be in that room and see if you're getting
[13:43.240 --> 13:45.200]  any light in that space.
[13:45.200 --> 13:46.560]  Stand in there for three to five minutes.
[13:46.560 --> 13:47.560]  Cover your eyes.
[13:47.560 --> 13:49.080]  Let them adjust when you open them up.
[13:49.080 --> 13:51.160]  Do you see any light at all?
[13:51.160 --> 13:55.840]  If you can see your hand in front of your face during the dark cycle, that is too much
[13:55.840 --> 13:56.840]  light.
[13:56.840 --> 13:59.360]  Also, sometimes those tents are not completely light proof.
[13:59.360 --> 14:02.660]  A lot of times I'll get just a black sheet and put it over it.
[14:02.660 --> 14:06.240]  Sometimes you've got to run a strip of duct tape right down the edge of where the zippers
[14:07.040 --> 14:08.040]  some light leaks.
[14:08.040 --> 14:11.320]  A lot of times near the corners where the seams are kind of pulling, like where there's
[14:11.320 --> 14:15.320]  a lot of stress of one seam going this way and one going that way at a corner, you'll
[14:15.320 --> 14:19.800]  get some stretchiness of the material and you'll get light leaks down there.
[14:19.800 --> 14:22.680]  That was harder to say than it looked, but you'll figure it out.
[14:22.680 --> 14:23.680]  So check for leaks.
[14:23.680 --> 14:24.920]  That is my main assumption.
[14:24.920 --> 14:28.000]  I think I've spent enough time saying light leaks on this one.
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.760]  So to my friend, the man with no name, big up.
[14:31.760 --> 14:32.760]  Thank you for the message.
[14:32.760 --> 14:34.200]  I hope we have solved your problem.
[14:34.200 --> 14:36.640]  If it is not a light leak, send me another message.
[14:36.640 --> 14:42.600]  Of course, the email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[14:42.600 --> 14:45.600]  All right, now let's jump into the part of the podcast that everybody has been waiting
[14:45.600 --> 14:48.120]  for the part that I teased at the top of the show.
[14:48.120 --> 14:50.960]  I do have a breeding question for you.
[14:50.960 --> 14:55.760]  We've got a friend who is breeding with the Australian bastard cannabis plant.
[14:55.760 --> 14:59.760]  Before I get too far into this, let's talk about the Australian bastard just briefly.
[14:59.760 --> 15:00.920]  You may have seen pictures of it.
[15:00.920 --> 15:01.920]  You may have heard about it.
[15:01.920 --> 15:03.080]  You may have read about it.
[15:03.080 --> 15:06.880]  You may have seen our friend, Trey K. DGC, highly gongenous.
[15:06.880 --> 15:09.440]  She changed her social media name and it threw me off.
[15:09.440 --> 15:10.960]  Big shout out to Trey K. DGC.
[15:10.960 --> 15:12.960]  She grew the Australian bastard.
[15:12.960 --> 15:15.580]  She's playing with the bastard.
[15:15.580 --> 15:18.440]  It is a very interesting looking cannabis plant.
[15:18.440 --> 15:21.560]  It does not produce normal looking cannabis leaves.
[15:21.560 --> 15:23.280]  They are kind of ferny.
[15:23.280 --> 15:26.940]  They look like something you'd find out in a rainforest or if you're walking along out
[15:26.940 --> 15:28.000]  in Oregon or something.
[15:28.000 --> 15:34.640]  It looks like a very Oregon-y, mossy area kind of a plant in my opinion.
[15:34.640 --> 15:36.120]  Once again, excuse me for the throat clearing.
[15:36.120 --> 15:38.280]  I will just blame that on the dabs all day.
[15:38.280 --> 15:39.840]  It's been a good weekend.
[15:39.840 --> 15:44.080]  Anyway, it looks more like a plant that you would find in a mossy area or something like
[15:44.080 --> 15:45.080]  that in my opinion.
[15:45.080 --> 15:48.560]  It looks like something that grandma might have in the mix of houseplants or something
[15:48.560 --> 15:49.560]  like that.
[15:49.560 --> 15:52.920]  So it doesn't really look like a traditional cannabis plant.
[15:52.920 --> 15:55.820]  Everybody that I've seen grow it, it does produce buds.
[15:55.820 --> 16:00.300]  It doesn't produce an amazing amount of trichomes or anything like that, but it does produce
[16:00.300 --> 16:02.360]  a very unique looking plant.
[16:02.360 --> 16:06.060]  So that is a preface if you will for this email.
[16:06.060 --> 16:09.700]  Now let's jump into the email part of this question.
[16:09.700 --> 16:11.540]  It goes, what's up bro?
[16:11.540 --> 16:12.780]  I hope all is well.
[16:12.780 --> 16:17.120]  I want to try breeding out for the first time.
[16:17.120 --> 16:21.500]  This is going to be a very interesting experiment for your first time breeding.
[16:21.500 --> 16:25.980]  I don't know that I would recommend this for your first time.
[16:25.980 --> 16:30.460]  Although I am the kind of person that wants you to have fun and do your thing.
[16:30.460 --> 16:36.300]  I would recommend to more regular cannabis plants, things that you're going to have.
[16:36.300 --> 16:39.220]  We'll talk about why in the future just because you're going to have to breed this multiple
[16:39.220 --> 16:41.980]  generations to see the results that you want.
[16:41.980 --> 16:44.860]  If that's what you're looking for, that's cool.
[16:44.860 --> 16:45.860]  That may be frustrating.
[16:45.860 --> 16:46.860]  It may be discouraging.
[16:46.860 --> 16:50.980]  If you want to see some results on the first run, I would work with regular plants, but
[16:50.980 --> 16:53.020]  I'm kind of, no, do your thing, bro.
[16:53.020 --> 16:54.260]  Have fun and do your thing.
[16:54.260 --> 16:55.500]  Live your dreams.
[16:55.500 --> 16:56.500]  Live your best life.
[16:56.500 --> 16:58.060]  You only live once, all that good stuff.
[16:58.060 --> 17:00.620]  Anyway, don't let me discourage you.
[17:00.620 --> 17:01.620]  That's just my advice.
[17:01.620 --> 17:05.660]  It says, I do want to use Humboldt Seed Company's Freak Show.
[17:05.660 --> 17:07.940]  It's kind of looks like a fern if you haven't seen it.
[17:07.940 --> 17:10.380]  Yes, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[17:10.380 --> 17:11.380]  Great plant.
[17:11.380 --> 17:14.100]  There are a couple of people out there putting different versions of the Freak Show out.
[17:14.100 --> 17:16.940]  It says, I'm not really sure what else I'm going to use.
[17:17.100 --> 17:22.580]  Anyway, my question is, how do I get the offspring to look like the Freak Show?
[17:22.580 --> 17:24.940]  That is a really good question.
[17:24.940 --> 17:29.060]  Most of the time, I would draw a Punnett square, and we'll talk about Punnett squares in the
[17:29.060 --> 17:30.060]  future.
[17:30.060 --> 17:31.340]  I'm not going to teach a full Punnett square.
[17:31.340 --> 17:36.860]  I would be able to predict a lot of what the plants are going to look like and a lot of
[17:36.860 --> 17:40.140]  what the genetics are going to do based on a Punnett square.
[17:40.140 --> 17:44.620]  Also based on, so when I teach about breeding, I say, learn about Mendel charts and Punnett
[17:44.620 --> 17:45.900]  squares.
[17:45.900 --> 17:48.540]  Learn about the way that the plants work together when you breed them.
[17:48.540 --> 17:50.780]  Just learn about the scientific part of that.
[17:50.780 --> 17:55.340]  Then I follow that up by saying, when you're breeding, forget all of that and use your
[17:55.340 --> 18:00.740]  intuition because that's really, I find that to be super important as well as a breeder.
[18:00.740 --> 18:02.460]  I'd like to say that I'm a successful breeder.
[18:02.460 --> 18:05.660]  I've made some crosses that are out there that are paying some bills and people are
[18:05.660 --> 18:06.700]  really happy with them.
[18:06.700 --> 18:09.180]  So we'll call that a success, right?
[18:09.180 --> 18:10.180]  I've got intuition.
[18:10.180 --> 18:11.680]  I can just see some plants.
[18:11.680 --> 18:15.340]  It's like, have you ever known two people and you're like, hey, you and hey, you, if
[18:15.340 --> 18:18.060]  you guys met, it's going to be fucking a match made in heaven.
[18:18.060 --> 18:20.980]  And you introduced two people and like five years later, they're married and they got
[18:20.980 --> 18:23.620]  a family and you're like, yeah, I'm kind of happy that I did that.
[18:23.620 --> 18:25.540]  Like I feel like I've got that ability with plants.
[18:25.540 --> 18:28.100]  I understand the Mendel charts, the aliel charts.
[18:28.100 --> 18:32.580]  I understand that sort of stuff, but also I can intuitively see the things that are
[18:32.580 --> 18:35.500]  going to kind of happen with these plants.
[18:35.500 --> 18:38.940]  Working with the Australian bastard, however, brings a lot of variables.
[18:38.940 --> 18:41.260]  I'm not familiar with that plant at all.
[18:41.260 --> 18:45.220]  I don't know a lot about its heritage, its history, where it came from, which helps me
[18:46.100 --> 18:49.340]  a lot as a breeder, as a grower to kind of predict a little bit.
[18:49.340 --> 18:50.460]  It's like a lot of information.
[18:50.460 --> 18:53.420]  It tells you a lot of things about a plant when you know its genetics, its parents, where
[18:53.420 --> 18:56.340]  it came from on the planet.
[18:56.340 --> 18:58.340]  It lets you know a lot about what to expect from it.
[18:58.340 --> 19:00.640]  But with the bastard, I didn't know.
[19:00.640 --> 19:06.460]  So I wrote, we would have to find out if that funky leaf trait, that ferny leaf, there's
[19:06.460 --> 19:07.660]  a technical word for it.
[19:07.660 --> 19:09.300]  We've gotten, what's the word that I found?
[19:09.300 --> 19:11.620]  I learned this word.
[19:11.620 --> 19:12.740]  I can't find the word in this.
[19:12.740 --> 19:13.740]  It'll pop up when I read this.
[19:13.740 --> 19:15.300]  I don't want to lose my place though.
[19:15.300 --> 19:17.020]  There's a word for that funky leaf.
[19:17.020 --> 19:20.620]  We have to find out, we have to determine if that is a recessive or a dominant trait.
[19:20.620 --> 19:24.420]  And the way to find that out basically is by growing out a batch of it and breeding
[19:24.420 --> 19:25.420]  with it and playing with it.
[19:25.420 --> 19:28.720]  You have to have experience with it.
[19:28.720 --> 19:34.540]  So then we have to decide, do you want to use a male or a female of the Australian bastard?
[19:34.540 --> 19:38.900]  Then from some, I talked to a friend who has grown and bred with the Australian bastard
[19:38.900 --> 19:39.900]  cannabis.
[19:39.900 --> 19:40.900]  I'm leading up to that.
[19:40.900 --> 19:44.020]  I was going to wonder if you want to use the male or the female, then it turns out
[19:44.020 --> 19:48.360]  that you're going to have to do some F2ing before you even get a good standard plant
[19:48.360 --> 19:51.240]  to start with.
[19:51.240 --> 19:54.560]  Something I did want to talk about before we get too far, and I don't want to discourage
[19:54.560 --> 19:59.860]  you from the Australian bastard cannabis, but I've never seen anybody post pictures
[19:59.860 --> 20:02.260]  of finished, and I'm not talking trash.
[20:02.260 --> 20:04.340]  This is my experience on social media.
[20:04.340 --> 20:06.180]  Nobody's ever posted a finished product.
[20:06.180 --> 20:09.780]  They've been like, look at this amazing Australian bastard cannabis.
[20:09.820 --> 20:14.420]  I've seen a lot of people post like week five, six, and seven photos, and they're like, look
[20:14.420 --> 20:15.940]  at this crazy shit.
[20:15.940 --> 20:17.820]  And then the pictures kind of taper off.
[20:17.820 --> 20:23.020]  It doesn't seem like too many people are blown away, ecstatic, super satisfied, braggadocious
[20:23.020 --> 20:24.140]  about the final product.
[20:24.140 --> 20:25.740]  I'm not really trying to talk shit.
[20:25.740 --> 20:28.220]  I'm just saying that's what I've experienced on the internet.
[20:28.220 --> 20:31.820]  Nobody seems to, the pictures are great, but nobody's like, man, when I smoke this, I'm
[20:31.820 --> 20:32.820]  on the moon.
[20:32.820 --> 20:36.860]  I haven't really seen anybody ecstatic and in love with the bastard cannabis in that
[20:36.860 --> 20:37.860]  aspect.
[20:37.860 --> 20:38.860]  It's really cool for photos.
[20:38.940 --> 20:43.300]  It may be cool for breeding, but I haven't seen anybody blown away by any of the quality.
[20:43.300 --> 20:44.300]  That's just my opinion.
[20:44.300 --> 20:47.900]  If you've got some Australian bastard cannabis out there that blew your mind, correct me.
[20:47.900 --> 20:48.900]  Send me a photo.
[20:48.900 --> 20:49.900]  Send me an email.
[20:49.900 --> 20:51.900]  GrowFromYourHeartAtHotMail.com.
[20:51.900 --> 20:54.060]  I look forward to friendly corrections and feedback.
[20:54.060 --> 20:55.060]  I invite that.
[20:55.060 --> 20:58.380]  If you're just going to tell me I'm a dick because I just said that, have some photos
[20:58.380 --> 20:59.580]  and something to back it up.
[20:59.580 --> 21:00.580]  I'm all about it.
[21:00.580 --> 21:01.820]  Let's be friendly with each other.
[21:01.820 --> 21:03.180]  I like that.
[21:03.180 --> 21:04.940]  Let's find my place in this message.
[21:05.060 --> 21:09.180]  Okay, so you're going to have to get yourself some Australian bastard cannabis seeds.
[21:09.180 --> 21:10.780]  It's probably how you're going to have to do this.
[21:10.780 --> 21:13.060]  Then you're going to have to grow them out.
[21:13.060 --> 21:15.940]  Find a plant with the traits you were looking for.
[21:15.940 --> 21:19.420]  Hopefully, find a male and a female with the traits you're looking for, and then you're
[21:19.420 --> 21:22.700]  going to have to breed those together.
[21:22.700 --> 21:27.980]  You can at the same time while you're doing this, you can pollinate other plants, but
[21:27.980 --> 21:31.940]  those aren't going to have the bastard trait as strongly.
[21:31.940 --> 21:34.900]  From some of the advice I was given, you're going to have to make F2s before you can even
[21:35.060 --> 21:39.540]  bring out that trait to get it to pass.
[21:39.540 --> 21:43.500]  Let me jump into this message that our friend ... I was talking with our friend, Locomotive
[21:43.500 --> 21:46.460]  Medical has been doing some breeding with the Freak Show.
[21:46.460 --> 21:50.380]  I just reached out to a member of the team because I knew somebody was working with it.
[21:50.380 --> 21:53.900]  I said, what can you tell me about breeding with the Freak Show because I have a question.
[21:53.900 --> 21:56.340]  Here's what my friend, Locomotive Medical had to say.
[21:56.340 --> 22:01.500]  It says, the Freak Show or the pinnate leaf trait, that's the word I was looking for,
[22:01.500 --> 22:09.060]  pinnate, P-I-N-N-A-T-E, pinnate leaf trait is recessive or at best an incomplete dominant.
[22:09.060 --> 22:15.900]  When you cross it with traditional palmate plants, the palmate trait dominates the F1s
[22:15.900 --> 22:18.260]  and the F1s mostly look normal.
[22:18.260 --> 22:23.880]  If you cross it with anything one time, that offspring is going to look mostly like a normal
[22:23.880 --> 22:24.880]  cannabis plant.
[22:24.880 --> 22:29.460]  You may see some outliers that do pop up with the bastard trait, but overall it sounds like
[22:29.860 --> 22:33.300]  most of them are going to look mostly normal.
[22:33.300 --> 22:39.260]  Now it says the F2s have some strange plants and 25% freaks.
[22:39.260 --> 22:43.180]  So this is where you're going to start finding plants that you can narrow down and isolate
[22:43.180 --> 22:46.460]  the leaf structure you're looking for.
[22:46.460 --> 22:52.400]  You're also going to have to think about the terps, the potency, the structure of the plant.
[22:52.400 --> 22:57.140]  This leaf structure is just one thing on a big chessboard of traits that we're looking
[22:57.140 --> 22:59.220]  for for a successful plant.
[22:59.260 --> 23:03.900]  That leaf trait is cool, but you want it to smoke good, smell good, taste good.
[23:03.900 --> 23:09.180]  You got to get high as fuck from it, or it's got to have a lot of CBD or something really
[23:09.180 --> 23:11.620]  high in a specific cannabinoid or a certain terp.
[23:11.620 --> 23:13.660]  It's got to blow your mind in some way.
[23:13.660 --> 23:17.820]  It's got to produce seven pounds of light or something like that to make it stand out,
[23:17.820 --> 23:19.100]  make it a good plant overall.
[23:19.100 --> 23:20.620]  It's got to be pathogen resistant.
[23:20.620 --> 23:22.380]  It's got to handle nutrients well.
[23:22.380 --> 23:23.380]  It's got to be growable.
[23:23.380 --> 23:24.940]  It's got to be enjoyable.
[23:24.940 --> 23:25.980]  It's got to be a good plant.
[23:25.980 --> 23:28.980]  That's just one trait is the leaf that we're looking for.
[23:29.020 --> 23:34.380]  The F2s will have some strange plants and 25% freaks.
[23:34.380 --> 23:39.260]  At this point, I would find another, a male and a female that both look like, that have
[23:39.260 --> 23:44.140]  the leaf trait you're looking for, that pennant leaf structure, and I would breed those together
[23:44.140 --> 23:45.140]  and make F3.
[23:45.140 --> 23:52.260]  Now, it says F3, you can stabilize for that trait by F3, similar to auto flower and photo
[23:52.260 --> 23:54.980]  period outcross projects work.
[23:54.980 --> 24:01.900]  By F3, you can lock it down, but the first cross is going to look just like normal plants.
[24:01.900 --> 24:05.940]  You may find a couple of weirdos in there, but then you got to cross it again to start
[24:05.940 --> 24:08.220]  getting more of that freak trait.
[24:08.220 --> 24:12.380]  You're not going to see it until the second and then the third one, you can lock it in.
[24:12.380 --> 24:17.620]  My friend says that's about all the tips I have for the Australian bastard cannabis.
[24:17.620 --> 24:22.060]  Big shout out to my buddy, Locomotive Medical, for having great info on breeding.
[24:22.060 --> 24:24.420]  Let's jump more back into your message.
[24:24.860 --> 24:27.940]  You want the traits to come out, you're trying to make it look like the freak show, so you're
[24:27.940 --> 24:29.860]  going to take the freak to another plant.
[24:29.860 --> 24:33.620]  The first time you do that, you're only going to get about 25% freaks.
[24:33.620 --> 24:36.900]  Find a freak that you like, the one that works the best for you.
[24:36.900 --> 24:39.580]  Find a male and a female, do that again.
[24:39.580 --> 24:43.140]  Then find another male and a female that work best for you and do that again.
[24:43.140 --> 24:48.180]  By the time you get to the F3, the seeds that come out after that should be quite a bit
[24:48.180 --> 24:50.140]  freak show uniformity.
[24:50.140 --> 24:53.980]  Then you can find the phenotype that works the best for you out of there.
[24:54.020 --> 24:55.380]  Then you can do a lot of things.
[24:55.380 --> 24:58.140]  You can self that, you can start back crossing things.
[24:58.140 --> 25:01.660]  Once you've got that gem that is exactly what you're looking for, which is probably around
[25:01.660 --> 25:06.580]  the F3 range, then you can start doing a lot of fun things with it.
[25:06.580 --> 25:11.100]  I hope I did not discourage you by giving you such a long path to success.
[25:11.100 --> 25:14.820]  Maybe you're the kind of person that enjoys a really long project like that.
[25:14.820 --> 25:19.100]  A lot of people want to chuck some pollen, make some seeds and see what they made.
[25:19.100 --> 25:20.100]  That is fun.
[25:20.100 --> 25:21.100]  F1s are great.
[25:21.100 --> 25:22.460]  There's a lot of fun diversity in there.
[25:22.460 --> 25:26.700]  If you trust and know your parent plants, you can make some great things.
[25:26.700 --> 25:30.100]  If you can predict what you're going to make with an F1, if you can kind of write down,
[25:30.100 --> 25:34.060]  I think my goal is this and if it comes out like that, that's fine.
[25:34.060 --> 25:36.140]  Make F1s that are predictable.
[25:36.140 --> 25:39.460]  That is a good product in my opinion.
[25:39.460 --> 25:41.260]  Some people are not into the F1s.
[25:41.260 --> 25:43.660]  But anyway, I'm kind of rambling.
[25:43.660 --> 25:47.760]  If you're excited about having a long project, I encourage you to do this.
[25:47.760 --> 25:53.440]  But for my first breeding project, I don't know that I would work with this Australian
[25:53.440 --> 25:54.440]  Bastard Cannabis.
[25:54.440 --> 25:56.320]  I may work with something different.
[25:56.320 --> 26:00.320]  If your goal is to fix the Australian Bastard, because I did say that I've never seen one
[26:00.320 --> 26:03.280]  that impresses me when it's finished, I'm really not trying to be rude.
[26:03.280 --> 26:07.560]  I'm just saying we see a lot of people post their grows and then we see it all the way
[26:07.560 --> 26:10.320]  up to the end and then we get to see them like harvest it in the pictures.
[26:10.320 --> 26:12.720]  They post a picture of them holding the buds.
[26:12.720 --> 26:14.740]  We don't see a lot of that with the Australian Bastard.
[26:14.740 --> 26:18.300]  They all quit posting their pictures around, I don't know, right after the buds start forming
[26:18.300 --> 26:20.580]  and kind of where they should get chunky.
[26:20.580 --> 26:22.520]  Then they just fizzle out with the photos.
[26:22.520 --> 26:26.540]  Not being hateful, just saying that's what I've seen mostly.
[26:26.540 --> 26:29.840]  Maybe you can be the person that breeds something to it to correct it.
[26:29.840 --> 26:33.940]  Maybe you can still get that Australian Bastard Cannabis leaf structure and the growth, the
[26:33.940 --> 26:38.060]  vigor, the potency of some of the other hype strains, popular strains, productive strains
[26:38.060 --> 26:39.060]  that are on the market.
[26:39.060 --> 26:41.740]  Now, if that is your goal, I do wish you the best of luck.
[26:41.740 --> 26:45.780]  If I can give you any other guidance, because I do not mean to ever discourage anybody,
[26:45.780 --> 26:49.860]  I would just rather set you up for success in your first run than watch you stumble and
[26:49.860 --> 26:50.860]  be frustrated.
[26:50.860 --> 26:54.500]  If I can give you any other guidance, any other advice, please do reach out.
