[00:17.210 --> 00:21.910]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 137 of the
[00:21.910 --> 00:25.850]  Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and
[00:25.850 --> 00:29.330]  conversation. That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.330 --> 00:33.490]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[00:33.490 --> 00:36.850]  even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis, this, my
[00:36.850 --> 00:41.530]  friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff. I
[00:41.530 --> 00:44.850]  want to thank you guys again for joining me. As always, I want to send a huge
[00:44.850 --> 00:47.730]  thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use

[01:46.770 --> 01:52.170]  Glass on 517 South Tejon in beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado. Drop in, say
[01:52.170 --> 01:56.010]  hello, and let them know that you heard about them on the Grow From Your Heart
[01:56.010 --> 01:59.730]  podcast. I would appreciate it and so would they. You guys, parts of this
[01:59.730 --> 02:02.410]  podcast are also brought to you by my good friends at Tocque Radio. This
[02:02.410 --> 02:06.610]  podcast is available on Tocque Radio every Wednesday at 1 p.m. Make sure you
[02:06.610 --> 02:10.490]  support Tocque Radio. Tune in on Tocque Radio. Give them a listen. Check out all
[02:10.490 --> 02:13.370]  the other wonderful podcasts on there. Shout out to my friend Lucy and her
[02:13.370 --> 02:18.450]  podcast Lucy in the Sky. In the future, I will be on that show. I have just
[02:18.450 --> 02:21.650]  made my commitment. I've just told the world that I plan on being on there. So
[02:21.650 --> 02:24.730]  Lucy, that means I've got to come on your show sometime and record with you on a
[02:24.730 --> 02:30.010]  Sunday. I look forward to it. So make sure you support TocqueRadio.com. Let's
[02:30.010 --> 02:32.850]  see, what else do I have for you? Portions of this podcast are brought to
[02:32.850 --> 02:36.530]  you by our good friends at Hemplements. Hemplements, you guys. Hemplements are
[02:36.530 --> 02:40.370]  bringing to you Hemp History Week. Hemp History Week, June 6th through June 12th.
[02:40.370 --> 02:45.370]  This is the 11th annual Hemp History Week. Hemp History Week began in 2009
[02:45.370 --> 02:49.410]  when the Hemp Industry Association and Vote Hemp joined forces to raise support
[02:49.410 --> 02:53.410]  for industrial hemp farming in the United States. In 2009, the Industrial
[02:53.410 --> 02:56.930]  Hemp Farm Act was introduced to clarify the difference between cannabis and
[02:56.930 --> 03:00.490]  industrial hemp and to repeal federal laws outlying the cultivation of
[03:00.490 --> 03:05.330]  industrial hemp. Hemp was illegal based on the ideals that it is easily confused
[03:05.330 --> 03:09.890]  with the cannabis plant. Industrial hemp does not contain THC, the main
[03:09.890 --> 03:13.170]  psychoactive molecule in cannabis. Industrial hemp is a highly sustainable
[03:13.170 --> 03:17.650]  crop that can be used to make products ranging from lip balm to hempcrete
[03:17.650 --> 03:21.650]  bricks. Ladies and gentlemen, Hemplements in Colorado Springs will be
[03:21.650 --> 03:25.650]  hosting events downtown which will feature classes on how to make and use
[03:25.650 --> 03:30.170]  hemp fibers and discussions on the benefits of hemp and CBD products for
[03:30.170 --> 03:33.850]  health and wellness. There will be a variety of activities and vendors on
[03:33.890 --> 03:38.290]  hand for everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to learn more about
[03:38.290 --> 03:42.690]  industrial hemp, make sure you check out Hemplements in Colorado Springs.
[03:42.690 --> 03:46.210]  Wednesday will feature arts and crafts and story time for children. They will
[03:46.210 --> 03:49.650]  also be having a barbecue featuring hemp burgers. For more information, check out

[04:06.850 --> 04:11.010]  podcast. If you listened to the last episode, episode number 136, that was
[04:11.010 --> 04:14.090]  what I call a swap cast. It's also known as a crossover episode. I had my
[04:14.090 --> 04:17.970]  friends from the Colorado podcast come by and they hung out for about two hours
[04:17.970 --> 04:22.370]  and re-recorded a ridiculous podcast. Big shout out to Jesse Grose, shout out
[04:22.370 --> 04:26.850]  to Despicable D and also a huge shout out to my buddy 44. Thank you guys for
[04:26.850 --> 04:29.890]  coming and recording a show. Make sure you guys support the Colorado podcast.
[04:29.890 --> 04:32.290]  If you haven't listened to that one yet, make sure you go back and listen
[04:32.290 --> 04:37.410]  to 136. It is a great podcast. All right. I think that's all the ads and
[04:37.410 --> 04:41.570]  information I have got to start the show. I want to talk about a message I
[04:41.570 --> 04:46.810]  received from a listener. He was talking about wondering if CBD derived from
[04:46.810 --> 04:51.610]  hemp is any good if it is the same as CBD derived from cannabis. He was
[04:51.610 --> 04:56.370]  thinking that hemp derived CBD would not have any medicinal value. I'm here to
[04:56.370 --> 05:01.210]  clear that up. That is inaccurate. CBD derived from hemp and CBD derived from
[05:01.210 --> 05:06.210]  cannabis is the same CBD. You're pulling out the same CBD. The main difference
[05:06.210 --> 05:11.570]  between hemp and cannabis is the amount of THC. The state of Colorado has set a
[05:11.570 --> 05:15.850]  threshold of how much THC is allowed to be in your plants before they are
[05:15.850 --> 05:20.530]  considered hemp or THC. Honestly, I do not remember the exact ratio. I
[05:20.530 --> 05:25.530]  think it's 5% THC. It could be 0.5% THC. It could be three. It's
[05:25.530 --> 05:28.570]  somewhere between 3% and 5% THC to the best of my knowledge. If it's got more
[05:28.570 --> 05:32.250]  than that, it is considered cannabis. If it's got less than that, it is considered
[05:32.250 --> 05:38.210]  a hemp plant. Our friends over at Sansol, a giant CBD farm or a giant hemp farm
[05:38.210 --> 05:43.210]  here in Pueblo, Colorado, produce massive amounts of CBD product from their hemp
[05:43.210 --> 05:46.890]  farm. If you were confused, if you were thinking that CBD derived from hemp
[05:46.890 --> 05:50.770]  versus CBD derived from cannabis is a different product, ladies and gentlemen,
[05:50.770 --> 05:55.370]  that is the same molecule. It will have the same medicinal benefits. It will do
[05:55.370 --> 05:58.890]  the same thing for you. If you took what was considered a hemp plant that was
[05:58.890 --> 06:03.010]  high in CBD and a cannabis plant that was high in THC and you ran them both
[06:03.010 --> 06:08.490]  through the exact same extraction method, whether it be BHO or CO2, you would pull
[06:08.490 --> 06:13.490]  out very similar products, very similar concentrates, but the hemp product is
[06:13.490 --> 06:19.610]  going to be very high in CBD and it will not contain any THC or very, very trace
[06:19.610 --> 06:24.490]  amounts, if any at all. The only difference is the source. The main
[06:24.570 --> 06:28.370]  difference of the source is just the lack of THC. So I pressed pause and I did a
[06:28.370 --> 06:31.890]  little bit of research. In the state of Colorado, the difference between hemp and
[06:31.890 --> 06:38.290]  cannabis, if a plant contains greater than 0.3% THC, it is considered a
[06:38.290 --> 06:43.050]  cannabis plant and it cannot qualify to be on a hemp farm. So that is a
[06:43.050 --> 06:47.570]  threshold. There is 0.3% THC. If it's got more than 0.3, it cannot be
[06:47.570 --> 06:51.130]  grown on a hemp farm. It must be then grown in a medical marijuana or a
[06:51.210 --> 06:55.890]  recreational marijuana cultivation facility that is regulated by the MED,
[06:55.890 --> 06:59.970]  which is a totally different ballgame than growing hemp. So we're able to
[06:59.970 --> 07:04.010]  produce large amounts of CBD products now because we're using hemp farms to do
[07:04.010 --> 07:08.130]  so, which is making CBD medicine available to many more people. So I hope
[07:08.130 --> 07:12.050]  that clears that up for you. We're gonna move forward. And thank you for the email.
[07:12.050 --> 07:15.130]  I've got another email. This one came from another listener. I'm not going to
[07:15.130 --> 07:19.730]  say, if you send me an email and you want your name said on the air, include that
[07:19.730 --> 07:22.490]  in your email because I try to be respectful and not bust out people's
[07:22.490 --> 07:24.890]  names. I don't know what state you're in. I don't know where you work. I don't
[07:24.890 --> 07:27.250]  know what you do. I don't want to get you in trouble by saying your name on the
[07:27.250 --> 07:32.130]  show. So if you'd like me to say your name, just let me know. Here's an email.
[07:32.130 --> 07:35.490]  This one says, hey, Ross to Jeff, thanks for putting out such a quality show.
[07:35.490 --> 07:38.770]  First of all, you're very welcome. Thank you for the compliment. It's stuff like
[07:38.770 --> 07:42.370]  that. It gives me the motivation to keep this show coming at you every week. It
[07:42.370 --> 07:45.890]  takes a lot of effort to do a weekly podcast when you work as much as I do. So
[07:45.890 --> 07:51.530]  these compliments and the words of affirmation, is that what that's called?
[07:51.530 --> 07:55.330]  The compliments and words of affirmation are definitely keeping me
[07:55.330 --> 07:58.690]  moving strong. So I appreciate that. Then the email goes on to say, I'm looking
[07:58.690 --> 08:01.370]  forward to your upcoming outdoor show you mentioned is in the works. I'm
[08:01.370 --> 08:07.170]  wondering if you can discuss strains that do particularly well outdoors. I am
[08:07.170 --> 08:10.490]  trying to get more outdoor episodes for you. It's hard to get Jesse here. Jesse is
[08:10.490 --> 08:14.050]  busy with his own podcast, his own gardens, his own business. But when Jesse's
[08:14.050 --> 08:18.170]  free, I will get him here for more outdoor stuff. This guy says, I'm growing
[08:18.170 --> 08:22.450]  an organ outdoors again this year. When researching strains online, I couldn't
[08:22.450 --> 08:25.770]  find much information on which do better indoors and out. I ended up picking
[08:25.770 --> 08:30.810]  clones of Blue Dream, Green Crack, Sunset Sherbet, and Gorilla Glue 4. I've read
[08:30.810 --> 08:33.770]  that Blue Dream does phenomenally outdoors, but couldn't find much on the
[08:33.770 --> 08:38.690]  rest. I looked at past Emerald Cup winners to see what has won there since
[08:38.690 --> 08:42.730]  those grows are outdoors, but I couldn't find many of those strains locally. I'm
[08:42.810 --> 08:46.690]  interested in PM resistant strains as well, since that's something we battle
[08:46.690 --> 08:50.410]  come fall. There's more to the email, but I took a screenshot and I didn't get the
[08:50.410 --> 08:53.530]  rest of it in there. So I appreciate you sending me that email. Let's talk about a
[08:53.530 --> 08:59.130]  few strains that I think would do very well for you outdoors. First of all, I
[08:59.130 --> 09:04.290]  could recommend almost anything from DJ Short. DJ Short's Flow and Blueberry do
[09:04.290 --> 09:08.770]  wonderfully outdoors. Those strains are very mold resistant. They finish kind of
[09:08.770 --> 09:13.210]  early and they will give you nice heavy harvest outdoors. Something you want to
[09:13.210 --> 09:17.170]  keep in mind for an outdoor garden is you need stuff that is going to finish
[09:17.170 --> 09:20.810]  kind of early. You don't want it to take a super long time. You got to get it done
[09:20.810 --> 09:24.330]  before the fall or the winter comes. Maybe out there in Oregon you have more
[09:24.330 --> 09:28.330]  time than we do here in Colorado. So you have a maybe a little longer window.
[09:28.330 --> 09:31.730]  Maybe you might be able to get something like some Sour Diesel or some Chemdog.
[09:31.730 --> 09:36.330]  Those strains do very well outdoors. They're very mold resistant. You're gonna
[09:36.410 --> 09:40.290]  want to stick with strains that finish around 60 days. About eight week strains
[09:40.290 --> 09:45.770]  would be ideal for you. Something like from my lineup I would recommend
[09:45.770 --> 09:50.730]  Capleton for outdoor strains. It finishes on time and puts on nice resin. It loves
[09:50.730 --> 09:55.010]  the sunshine. When you grow it in soil, add plenty of kelp products. It'll make
[09:55.010 --> 09:59.810]  it taste nice and funky, nice and earthy. Capleton is very mold resistant.
[09:59.810 --> 10:04.830]  Also Golden Goat. If you can get it finished in time, Golden Goat will take
[10:04.830 --> 10:09.750]  about 65 to 70 days to reach full maturity outdoors. But outdoor Golden
[10:09.750 --> 10:15.030]  Goat is amazing. Golden Goat loves that sunshine and it will harvest super
[10:15.030 --> 10:19.230]  heavily. Another strain I can recommend for great outdoor growing is old-school
[10:19.230 --> 10:23.890]  Hindu Kush. Hindu Kush finishes on time and it really loves to be grown in an
[10:23.890 --> 10:27.350]  outdoor environment. We had some wonderful Hindu Kush going through our
[10:27.350 --> 10:31.590]  area a few years ago. I knew the grower. He said he never had problems with
[10:31.630 --> 10:35.630]  mildew. The bugs didn't like the Hindu Kush. It was a wonderful plant for
[10:35.630 --> 10:39.830]  outdoors. So those are some great outdoor strains that we can recommend. It looks
[10:39.830 --> 10:43.070]  like you've already chosen your strains because you had to rely on clones that
[10:43.070 --> 10:46.590]  were available in your area. So the Blue Dream should do all right outside. It
[10:46.590 --> 10:50.550]  should produce really heavily if it gets finished on time. Green Crack I don't
[10:50.550 --> 10:54.590]  have a lot of experience with. The Sunset Sherbet I don't have a lot of experience
[10:54.590 --> 10:58.950]  there. Gorilla Glue 4, that is a hardy plant. It will grow like a beast outside.
[10:59.550 --> 11:03.910]  I hope everything finishes up on time. I hope your outdoor harvest goes perfectly
[11:03.910 --> 11:10.310]  for you. I thank you for the email and I hope we answered your question. Alright I
[11:10.310 --> 11:14.590]  do have another email. This one, if I can pull it up on the phone here. Alright
[11:14.590 --> 11:18.190]  this one comes from one of our friends on Instagram and he says, Hey Ross to
[11:18.190 --> 11:22.190]  Jeff I have a quick question that I feel you can easily said shed some light upon.
[11:22.190 --> 11:26.950]  Sorry words are hard to do you guys. He says I've started my outdoor crop early
[11:26.950 --> 11:31.790]  indoors under a 400 watt metal halide and July 1st is my outside plant day and
[11:31.790 --> 11:38.510]  currently my plants are on a 24-hour cycle. I feel I should 18-6 to start
[11:38.510 --> 11:41.710]  acclimating them to get ready for the outdoors soon. Any thoughts on this
[11:41.710 --> 11:45.790]  subject? I appreciate your time. I know you're a busy man. Sincerely a longtime
[11:45.790 --> 11:50.630]  podcast listener and then he signs with his name. So dude I don't know if you
[11:50.630 --> 11:55.910]  want me to say your name but he's asking if he he's growing his plants indoors
[11:55.910 --> 11:58.950]  and he's getting them started so that he can put them outside July 1st and
[11:58.950 --> 12:02.790]  he's asking so far he's got them under a 24-hour light cycle and he's asking if
[12:02.790 --> 12:07.470]  he should adjust his light schedule to 18-6 to get them ready for the outdoor
[12:07.470 --> 12:12.070]  Sun schedule. That is a really good question. I feel like I'm talking really
[12:12.070 --> 12:15.310]  fast so I'm gonna press pause for a minute. I'm gonna take a couple of fat
[12:15.310 --> 12:19.910]  dabs and a drink and I will be right back and we will talk about this.
[12:19.910 --> 12:24.150]  Alright I am back. I feel like I had enough dabs to kind of override all the
[12:24.150 --> 12:28.350]  caffeine I've had today. I just took some fat dabs of lemon G grown by myself
[12:28.350 --> 12:31.970]  at the Green and Healthy Wellness garden extracted by our good friends at
[12:31.970 --> 12:36.030]  Turpex and available on the shelves at Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado
[12:36.030 --> 12:39.170]  Springs. Since I'm talking about Green and Healthy Wellness I want to do two
[12:39.170 --> 12:43.550]  quick shoutouts. Huge shout out to John Randles Jr. That dude has been trimming
[12:43.550 --> 12:48.190]  his ass off. Ladies and gentlemen if you shop at Green and Healthy Wellness most
[12:48.190 --> 12:51.710]  of the flowers there are trimmed by our friend Randles. So make sure you follow
[12:51.710 --> 12:55.750]  Randles on Instagram it's at nugtendo. Give him a shout out let him know that
[12:55.750 --> 12:59.430]  you appreciate the way he is trimming the flowers. Also I owe a huge shout out
[12:59.430 --> 13:03.990]  to my new friend Zach. Zach is helping out in the garden. Zach you were killing
[13:03.990 --> 13:07.470]  it my friend. I took a day off and I came back and all of the plants were still
[13:07.470 --> 13:12.350]  alive so I am impressed. Thanks a lot brother. I should mention that Green and

[13:37.590 --> 13:41.430]  help you out. You guys let's get back to this listener email. Our listener was
[13:41.430 --> 13:45.910]  asking about putting his plants outdoors. He's had them on a 24-hour light cycle.
[13:45.910 --> 13:50.830]  He wants to know if he should adjust his lights to an 18-6 photo period before
[13:50.830 --> 13:55.790]  taking them outside. You know I sent Jesse a message and I asked him what he
[13:55.790 --> 13:59.510]  thought about this because I had my own idea. Jesse and I have two different
[13:59.510 --> 14:04.110]  ideas on this. I think both of these ideas are going to work. Let me say this
[14:04.110 --> 14:08.550]  before I get too far into this. No matter what you do I recommend that you take
[14:08.550 --> 14:13.070]  these plants outside and put them in the sun for maybe two hours on the first day
[14:13.070 --> 14:16.510]  and then bring them back inside. Then take them outside and put them in the
[14:16.510 --> 14:19.830]  sun for maybe two and a half to three hours the next day. Then bring them
[14:19.830 --> 14:23.510]  back inside and then take them back outside. Just give them like you know
[14:23.510 --> 14:27.350]  maybe 30 to another hour every day of sunlight so they can get used to that
[14:27.350 --> 14:31.030]  sun. Maybe by about the seventh to tenth day you can just leave them out
[14:31.030 --> 14:34.990]  there and they'll be cool. I think you should slowly adjust them to the sun or
[14:34.990 --> 14:38.230]  they're good. They might get fried. If they're not super hardy plants
[14:38.230 --> 14:41.830]  that sun might kick their ass. Keep that in mind. Slowly introduce them to the
[14:41.830 --> 14:44.670]  sun because if you just put them out there they're gonna get a sunburn and
[14:44.670 --> 14:49.070]  kind of freak out. Think about that. My opinion about your light cycle was
[14:49.070 --> 14:53.110]  that you should just leave your lights on 24 hours and then start taking the
[14:53.110 --> 14:57.350]  plants out and get them adjusted. Then once you take them outside, once
[14:57.350 --> 14:59.670]  you're permanently out there, if you have them in pots and you're gonna leave
[14:59.670 --> 15:03.390]  them out there or if you put them in the ground, once they're out there forever it
[15:03.390 --> 15:07.910]  will only take a few days for them to adjust to the sun's natural photo period.
[15:07.910 --> 15:11.510]  The sun is much more intense than the light that you have in your grow room.
[15:11.510 --> 15:17.790]  It will train those plants what to do. There are specific spectrums that
[15:17.790 --> 15:22.550]  the sun puts off at sunrise and sunset that trigger hormones inside your plant
[15:22.550 --> 15:26.950]  that tell it when to go to sleep and when to wake up. So the sun will start
[15:26.950 --> 15:31.070]  programming your plant when to wake up and when to sleep very quickly. It won't
[15:31.070 --> 15:35.870]  take very long for your plant to adjust to that. If you leave your grow lights on
[15:35.870 --> 15:41.430]  24-7 then you take it outside and you throw it in that sun, that normal cycle
[15:41.430 --> 15:45.910]  it may start to flower. That's the only downfall to that. It may start to
[15:45.910 --> 15:49.870]  autoflower a little bit early and then it'll go back into veg and then it will
[15:49.870 --> 15:54.270]  flower at the appropriate time. So that may be an issue if you have a plant that
[15:54.270 --> 15:59.150]  has a very very sensitive photo period. That would be the only downfall to that.
[15:59.150 --> 16:05.550]  So what Jesse said to do was to try to match the schedule of the sun with the
[16:05.550 --> 16:09.070]  schedule of your grow lights. That's going to be a little bit challenging
[16:09.190 --> 16:14.270]  because like I said the time that the news or your farmers almanac are going
[16:14.270 --> 16:19.110]  to say that the sun is going to rise and set, that is those those times in those
[16:19.110 --> 16:24.470]  books and on the news are accurate. But when do the far-red and near-red
[16:24.470 --> 16:28.790]  spectrums of the sun start shining onto your plants outside? It's hard to figure
[16:28.790 --> 16:34.230]  that out exactly. So you're gonna want to try to match the sun rise and sunset as
[16:34.230 --> 16:39.030]  best you can to get those plants on sort of a schedule. But I think that you'd be
[16:39.030 --> 16:44.230]  just fine if you ran that 24-hour light cycle and slowly introduce your plants
[16:44.230 --> 16:48.910]  to the sun. It's called hardening them off. Get them nice and stable. Put them
[16:48.910 --> 16:52.430]  in their forever homes and then just let the sun work its magic and put those
[16:52.430 --> 16:57.870]  plants into its schedule. That would be my guidance. If you have the time and the
[16:57.870 --> 17:02.790]  energy, do some research. Find out what time the sun will be setting and rising
[17:02.790 --> 17:07.150]  for about a week and then start adjusting your timers every day to that
[17:07.150 --> 17:12.250]  schedule and get your sunrise and sunset times matched up exactly to the
[17:12.250 --> 17:16.150]  outside time with the sun and then start putting your plants outside, harden them
[17:16.150 --> 17:20.230]  off and get them on that schedule. By the time they are outside permanently, have
[17:20.230 --> 17:24.150]  them adjusted to that schedule. If you have the time and the energy to research
[17:24.150 --> 17:28.550]  it and make that happen, do it. If you don't have the energy and the time for
[17:28.550 --> 17:32.070]  that, run it 24-7 and throw them out there. If you're running some indicas,
[17:32.070 --> 17:38.590]  you'll be just fine. If you're running some sativas, they may start to flower on
[17:38.590 --> 17:43.030]  you a little bit early. Some of those sativas will flower a little bit sooner
[17:43.030 --> 17:46.710]  because just a slight change in photo period is all they get in their natural
[17:46.710 --> 17:51.230]  habitat. So they're gonna trigger flowering with just a little bit of a
[17:51.230 --> 17:55.390]  variation in photo period. So pay attention to your plants. If you do
[17:55.390 --> 17:58.350]  notice that your plants are starting to flower a little bit too early in the
[17:58.350 --> 18:02.030]  season, one good way to stop that from happening or to make sure that it
[18:02.030 --> 18:06.510]  doesn't happen is to get a light and get a long extension cord and just carry a
[18:06.510 --> 18:10.950]  light outside and shine it over all of those plants about three hours after the
[18:10.950 --> 18:15.150]  sun goes down and that will keep those plants awake and it won't let them turn
[18:15.150 --> 18:19.430]  into their flowering cycle. So that's one way you can make sure that they don't
[18:19.430 --> 18:22.630]  flower too early and if you do see them starting to flower a little bit early,
[18:22.630 --> 18:26.750]  that's one way to kind of revert and prevent this from happening. It doesn't
[18:26.750 --> 18:29.710]  matter what kind of light you use and it doesn't have to be really super
[18:29.710 --> 18:32.670]  intense. As long as you just get out there for a few minutes and shine it
[18:32.670 --> 18:36.470]  over each plant, you'll wake them up, they won't start sleeping, they won't get
[18:36.470 --> 18:40.030]  enough sleep to go into their flowering period and you can kind of extend your
[18:40.030 --> 18:44.750]  veg phase. So I hope that helped you make a decision on how you're going to handle
[18:44.750 --> 18:47.790]  your adjustment. Just make sure you introduce the plants to the sunshine
[18:47.790 --> 18:50.550]  kind of slowly because if they're small plants, if they're not really healthy,
[18:50.550 --> 18:56.110]  that sun will kick their ass. Also if you've got more plants inside, if you're
[18:56.110 --> 19:00.070]  taking some plants outside and then bringing them back, if you do leave
[19:00.070 --> 19:03.510]  plants inside for an indoor grow, make sure you treat those because there's a
[19:03.510 --> 19:08.030]  good likelihood that you will bring outdoor pests into your indoor garden
[19:08.030 --> 19:11.950]  and cause a problem there. So be careful with that and also here's guidance for
[19:11.950 --> 19:14.910]  anybody with two gardens. If you've got an indoor and an outdoor garden, if
[19:14.910 --> 19:18.030]  you're growing cannabis in more than one location, should if you've got two indoor
[19:18.030 --> 19:22.790]  gardens, try to change clothes and shoes before you go from one garden to the
[19:22.790 --> 19:25.710]  other, especially your outdoor and indoor garden. You don't want to run
[19:25.710 --> 19:29.910]  from the outdoor garden to your indoor garden in the same shoes, in the same
[19:29.910 --> 19:34.430]  pants, in the same shirt, in the same hat. It's a good idea to change clothes if you
[19:34.430 --> 19:38.550]  can. I know it's not always possible but try to kick off your shoes, change your
[19:38.550 --> 19:42.390]  pants, change your t-shirt, put on a different hat. If you've got dreadlocks like me, put
[19:42.390 --> 19:46.310]  up your dreads in a different hat. You just don't want to drag problems from
[19:46.310 --> 19:49.070]  one garden to the other. If you've got powdery mildew, if you've got spider
[19:49.070 --> 19:52.670]  mites, your shoes, your hat, your clothes, it's the greatest way to move those
[19:52.710 --> 19:57.550]  bugs around. It'll just introduce problems to every garden you go to. Try
[19:57.550 --> 20:00.670]  to keep in mind when you're moving from one place to another, if you're going
[20:00.670 --> 20:04.070]  from your garden to your friend's garden to another person's garden, just keep in
[20:04.070 --> 20:07.870]  mind you're just spreading garden STDs everywhere you go. Keep a change of
[20:07.870 --> 20:11.750]  clothes in your car if you're that kind of person. Do what you can to stop
[20:11.750 --> 20:14.710]  spreading spider mites and fucking powdery mildew through the cannabis
[20:14.710 --> 20:19.230]  industry. That's my guidance. Alright, that's enough listener emails for today.

[20:54.470 --> 20:58.190]  a small garden. An elderly gentleman who needs a lot of help. He had a powdery
[20:58.190 --> 21:02.790]  mildew issue and Big Time Exterminator seems to have gotten rid of his powdery
[21:02.790 --> 21:06.870]  mildew issue. Also, it got rid of white flies in another garden. I have not seen
[21:06.870 --> 21:11.110]  a white fly. I've not seen a spider mite. I haven't seen a fungus gnat. It seems
[21:11.110 --> 21:15.230]  like Big Time Exterminator is doing a very good job at getting rid of a lot of
[21:15.230 --> 21:19.550]  problems. It's also approved by the Colorado MED. It is allowed to be used
