[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  Hey, everybody.
[00:01.000 --> 00:04.460]  Welcome to the Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:04.460 --> 00:06.060]  This is episode 428.
[00:06.060 --> 00:07.320]  Thank you for joining me.
[00:07.320 --> 00:10.900]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:10.900 --> 00:15.220]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and you can
[00:15.220 --> 00:21.940]  find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:21.940 --> 00:26.220]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:26.220 --> 00:31.500]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Malibu Pure Kush Full Spectrum Extract from our friends
[00:31.500 --> 00:32.980]  at Apothecary Farms.
[00:32.980 --> 00:40.900]  The potency label says this product contains 85% THC and 98% total cannabinoids.
[00:40.900 --> 00:43.340]  This concentrate has me super stoned.
[00:43.340 --> 00:46.740]  Most of the time I buy a product that makes me kind of high, more of an uppy, kind of
[00:46.740 --> 00:48.960]  a brain mixing kind of a thing.
[00:48.960 --> 00:51.820]  This concentrate has got me on slow motion.
[00:51.820 --> 00:52.820]  I am chilled out.
[00:52.820 --> 00:54.060]  I'm sitting back in the chair.
[00:54.060 --> 00:56.100]  I feel like I'm talking super slow.
[00:56.180 --> 01:00.300]  I feel like if I tried to play music, my quarter notes would be super wide right now.
[01:00.300 --> 01:04.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I do have a great podcast lined up for you.
[01:04.340 --> 01:09.180]  Before we get there, I would like to give a shout out to a few of my friends from Patreon.
[01:09.180 --> 01:12.220]  Let's start it off with a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:12.220 --> 01:13.420]  Shout out to my friend Tommy.
[01:13.420 --> 01:16.180]  How about a big shout out to our friend Isaac Green?
[01:16.180 --> 01:18.380]  I want to send some love to our buddy Brett G.
[01:18.380 --> 01:21.400]  I owe a big shout out to our friend Matthew KW.
[01:21.400 --> 01:26.020]  Of course, as always, a big old Grow From Your Heart shout out to our buddy Dick Goals.
[01:26.060 --> 01:30.980]  And of course, a big Grow From Your Heart fist bump to our friend Remy Redeye.

[01:48.060 --> 01:49.780]  present, and in the future.
[01:49.780 --> 01:53.300]  All right, I've got a lot of fun stuff to talk about in this episode.
[01:53.300 --> 01:55.420]  Let's start with my favorite part.
[01:55.820 --> 01:59.460]  If you have been listening to this podcast for a while, you know that I am a huge fan
[01:59.460 --> 02:00.460]  of comedy.
[02:00.460 --> 02:01.460]  I love standup comedy.
[02:01.460 --> 02:03.860]  I love going to see live comedy shows.
[02:03.860 --> 02:09.460]  I have built friendships with several well-known, people may call them famous comedians.
[02:09.460 --> 02:15.020]  I've also established and developed a relationship with my favorite club, Comedy Works in Denver.
[02:15.020 --> 02:19.660]  They are one of the top three, probably the top two comedy clubs on the planet, in my
[02:19.660 --> 02:23.340]  opinion, only rivaled by the Comedy Store in LA.
[02:23.340 --> 02:27.900]  And that is just because all of the famous comedians live in Hollywood and or the LA
[02:27.900 --> 02:28.900]  area.
[02:28.900 --> 02:29.900]  So they are more available.
[02:29.900 --> 02:33.540]  However, Comedy Works is my favorite comedy club on the planet.
[02:33.540 --> 02:35.420]  I love going to see live comedy.
[02:35.420 --> 02:37.180]  I love hanging out at Comedy Works.
[02:37.180 --> 02:38.860]  They treat me like a rock star.
[02:38.860 --> 02:39.860]  That is a great club.
[02:39.860 --> 02:41.300]  It is designed beautifully for comedy.
[02:41.300 --> 02:43.740]  I like a small room for a comedy show.
[02:43.740 --> 02:46.820]  There's a thing that happens when you see comedy in a large venue.
[02:46.820 --> 02:48.860]  The comedian will tell his joke, he'll say his punchline.
[02:48.860 --> 02:51.540]  So he'd be like, and that's when I punched him in the dick.
[02:51.540 --> 02:56.100]  And so the crowd will laugh and the laughter will go from the front to the back, all the
[02:56.100 --> 02:58.680]  way to the back, up to the balcony.
[02:58.680 --> 03:01.700]  Then somehow that laughter sweeps back to the comedian.
[03:01.700 --> 03:06.500]  It goes back across the balcony, from the back of the room, back up to the front of
[03:06.500 --> 03:07.500]  the room.
[03:07.500 --> 03:09.260]  The people in the front laugh, they applaud a little bit.
[03:09.260 --> 03:10.540]  And then people do that thing.
[03:10.540 --> 03:12.220]  There's a sign that you give when you're done laughing.
[03:12.220 --> 03:14.740]  You go, ha ha ha.
[03:14.740 --> 03:20.020]  Then the comedian has to wait for that to be able to tell his next, if it's just a tagline
[03:20.100 --> 03:21.740]  or if it's a whole nother bit.
[03:21.740 --> 03:26.100]  So there's a lot of patience and a lot of time between jokes and between sentences in
[03:26.100 --> 03:28.460]  a big comedy venue.
[03:28.460 --> 03:32.740]  One of the things I really enjoy about Comedy Works is how intimate the place is.
[03:32.740 --> 03:34.200]  The ceiling is very low.
[03:34.200 --> 03:35.860]  The seats are close together.
[03:35.860 --> 03:39.140]  I think the club holds less than 300 total people.
[03:39.140 --> 03:41.460]  So when you're in there, the vibe is tight.
[03:41.460 --> 03:42.460]  Everybody is locked in.
[03:42.460 --> 03:43.840]  Everybody is paying attention.
[03:43.840 --> 03:47.100]  They actually put your phones in a bag that you cannot open.
[03:47.100 --> 03:49.760]  It's got like a little, like that shoplifting thing at the mall.
[03:50.500 --> 03:53.360]  You got to run it through a little thing to get the tag off your clothes.
[03:53.360 --> 03:56.760]  They put your phone in a little bag that has a tag like that on it.
[03:56.760 --> 03:58.880]  So your phone is locked up during the show.
[03:58.880 --> 04:01.120]  If you want to use your phone, you can walk out to the lobby.
[04:01.120 --> 04:03.000]  They will undo your phone and you can use it.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.280]  But I love that everybody has their phones locked up in these bags.
[04:06.280 --> 04:08.600]  So when you're in the showroom, it is nice and tight.
[04:08.600 --> 04:12.760]  So in Comedy Works, what I love about it is they tell a joke and the laughter hits the
[04:12.760 --> 04:16.880]  audience, the laughter explodes, then the comedian can throw in his next line.
[04:16.880 --> 04:19.120]  So if he says like, so I kicked him in the dick.
[04:19.120 --> 04:21.760]  And then if the crowd laughs and he goes, and then he dropped his change or whatever,
[04:21.760 --> 04:22.760]  I don't know what the joke is.
[04:22.760 --> 04:25.240]  But if you throw out, there's always that one more line that you want to throw just
[04:25.240 --> 04:27.200]  to make people chuckle again.
[04:27.200 --> 04:29.160]  Those don't get lost in a small comedy club.
[04:29.160 --> 04:33.560]  So I really enjoy that atmosphere, that environment of a tiny comedy club.
[04:33.560 --> 04:38.440]  So what I'm rambling about is I really enjoy the atmosphere and environment of the downtown
[04:38.440 --> 04:40.560]  Comedy Works in Denver.
[04:40.560 --> 04:46.920]  So on Sunday, I was headed to see Doug Benson record his live taping of his podcast called
[04:46.920 --> 04:48.800]  Doug Loves Movies.
[04:48.800 --> 04:54.240]  Doug Benson has a podcast that is kind of a movie game show, a movie trivia game show
[04:54.240 --> 04:55.520]  type of a thing.
[04:55.520 --> 05:00.960]  He does a show where he hosts the show and he brings three guests, usually actors, comedians,
[05:00.960 --> 05:03.800]  or somebody local that people will know.
[05:03.800 --> 05:07.480]  And he invites them on stage to participate in games.
[05:07.480 --> 05:08.800]  There is a prize bag.
[05:08.800 --> 05:13.000]  Each person who is a guest on the show is expected to bring a small prize.
[05:13.000 --> 05:14.760]  They don't expect anything serious.
[05:14.760 --> 05:18.000]  Quite often, the people don't know they need to bring a prize until they're on their way
[05:18.000 --> 05:19.000]  to the show.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.680]  So they stop at some weird gift shop or sometimes Target or whatever is close and they just
[05:23.680 --> 05:25.720]  get random shit and put it in the bag.
[05:25.720 --> 05:27.440]  It is just more fun than anything else.
[05:27.440 --> 05:29.920]  So there's usually a prize bag played for.
[05:29.920 --> 05:31.240]  Then there are name tags.
[05:31.240 --> 05:33.500]  People in the audience will design name tags.
[05:33.500 --> 05:37.780]  The name tags are usually, they're supposed to be designed after movie poster spoofs where
[05:37.780 --> 05:39.820]  you insert your name.
[05:39.820 --> 05:41.860]  A lot of people get really creative.
[05:41.860 --> 05:46.300]  Just for a good example, in the past I have used Rasta Jeff Strikes Back as my name tag
[05:46.300 --> 05:47.500]  movie poster.
[05:47.500 --> 05:51.300]  And I just put my name right there over or my face right there over Luke Skywalker's
[05:51.300 --> 05:52.300]  face.
[05:52.300 --> 05:55.860]  So it's got my smiling face with my backwards hat, my dreadlocks hanging down.
[05:55.860 --> 05:57.300]  But I look like Luke Skywalker.
[05:57.300 --> 05:58.780]  I've got my lightsaber going.
[05:58.780 --> 06:00.380]  I'm ready to fuck some shit up.
[06:00.380 --> 06:03.220]  So it is Rasta Jeff Strikes Back is my name tag.
[06:03.220 --> 06:06.980]  Also, many of the people in the audience get very creative.
[06:07.180 --> 06:10.780]  Many of Doug's guests are cannabis consumers.
[06:10.780 --> 06:12.260]  Also they love candy.
[06:12.260 --> 06:17.860]  So a lot of people will attach candy or cannabis related products to their name tag to encourage
[06:17.860 --> 06:19.980]  their name tag to be selected.
[06:19.980 --> 06:21.460]  Let's talk about that now.
[06:21.460 --> 06:24.120]  The contestants come out, they talk about their prize bag.
[06:24.120 --> 06:25.820]  They put their prizes in the prize bag.
[06:25.820 --> 06:27.580]  Then they select a name tag.
[06:27.580 --> 06:29.900]  They are playing for somebody in the audience.
[06:29.900 --> 06:34.020]  So if they win the games, the person whose name tag they selected will win the prize
[06:34.020 --> 06:35.020]  bag.
[06:35.060 --> 06:38.580]  So the celebrity or the comedian or this guest doesn't walk away with the prizes because
[06:38.580 --> 06:39.860]  that's just cheesy.
[06:39.860 --> 06:43.460]  They're actually playing for somebody in the audience that encourages the audience to bring
[06:43.460 --> 06:44.460]  name tags.
[06:44.460 --> 06:48.940]  It is a really fun, interactive, kind of a culty sort of a podcast sort of event.
[06:48.940 --> 06:50.620]  Doug has a really tight following.
[06:50.620 --> 06:53.540]  There are some really inside jokes that are really funny.
[06:53.540 --> 06:56.940]  If you go to a Doug loves movies taping and you're not sure what's going on, there will
[06:56.940 --> 07:00.020]  be some really funny random audience interaction.
[07:00.020 --> 07:03.360]  If you say certain words, Doug will reply with certain things.
[07:03.440 --> 07:07.000]  If you say certain words, the audience will reply with certain things.
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.720]  There are certain cues at the start of the show that Doug expects you to actually reply.
[07:11.720 --> 07:14.760]  Sometimes people improvise on those and it makes it even funnier.
[07:14.760 --> 07:18.840]  Anyway, that is the gist of the Doug Benson live taping.
[07:18.840 --> 07:20.840]  He comes out, he brings out three guests.
[07:20.840 --> 07:23.040]  They select, they show their prizes.
[07:23.040 --> 07:24.040]  They select name tags.
[07:24.040 --> 07:25.480]  Then there is a game portion of the show.
[07:25.480 --> 07:26.920]  They play games.
[07:26.920 --> 07:28.200]  That is the main part of the show.
[07:28.200 --> 07:30.540]  That's where all the madness and the comedy ensues.
[07:30.900 --> 07:36.360]  I was headed to Denver on Sunday, which was Mother's Day, to go see the traditional annual
[07:36.360 --> 07:40.500]  Mother's Day taping of Doug loves movies at the downtown comedy works.
[07:40.500 --> 07:45.060]  I was about an hour into my two hour drive on my way to comedy works and my phone vibrated
[07:45.060 --> 07:50.700]  and I noticed that I had a message on Twitter from our friend Doug Benson.
[07:50.700 --> 07:55.500]  I picked up my phone, gave it a quick look and it said, are you ready to be a guest on
[07:55.500 --> 07:57.660]  a full episode?
[07:57.660 --> 07:58.980]  I was a little bit confused.
[07:58.980 --> 08:00.500]  I didn't want to jump to conclusions.
[08:00.500 --> 08:02.180]  I didn't want to get too excited.
[08:02.180 --> 08:06.300]  So I set my phone down and continued driving for a few moments until traffic got really
[08:06.300 --> 08:07.300]  clear.
[08:07.300 --> 08:08.380]  I could get into the right lane.
[08:08.380 --> 08:11.480]  I could hand my phone over to the person in the passenger seat and say, hey, does that
[08:11.480 --> 08:13.100]  say what I think it says?
[08:13.100 --> 08:16.860]  When she read it, she said, he's asking if you want to be on the show.
[08:16.860 --> 08:19.480]  I thought to myself, that can't be what that says.
[08:19.480 --> 08:21.140]  Everything in me said, don't get too excited.
[08:21.140 --> 08:22.680]  That is not what that says.
[08:22.680 --> 08:23.680]  So I messaged him back.
[08:23.680 --> 08:25.100]  I said, you mean like on the panel?
[08:25.100 --> 08:27.540]  He said, yeah, dude, I want you to be on the show.
[08:27.540 --> 08:34.460]  So I got to be a full guest on the Doug Loves Movies podcast at my favorite comedy club
[08:34.460 --> 08:35.460]  on the planet.
[08:35.460 --> 08:39.800]  I really don't think I believed it until I was on the stage and sitting to my right was
[08:39.800 --> 08:40.800]  Doug Benson.
[08:40.800 --> 08:43.460]  To my left was a comedian known as Taylor Tomlinson.
[08:43.460 --> 08:46.420]  And then to her left was a comedian called Jeff Tate.
[08:46.420 --> 08:50.460]  And as soon as everybody started talking, I was like, hey, I'm on the Doug Loves Movies
[08:50.460 --> 08:51.460]  podcast.
[08:51.460 --> 08:54.700]  Suddenly, I felt really comfortable and I felt really at home.
[08:54.700 --> 08:56.420]  So let's talk more about how the day went.
[08:56.420 --> 08:57.420]  I drove up to Denver.
[08:58.300 --> 08:59.300]  I got a good parking spot.
[08:59.300 --> 09:02.060]  Of course, I got kind of lit in the parking lot because I had to calm myself down before
[09:02.060 --> 09:03.700]  I headed up to Comedy Works.
[09:03.700 --> 09:04.860]  I walked up to Comedy Works.
[09:04.860 --> 09:06.780]  I got myself situated in there.
[09:06.780 --> 09:07.980]  I had Miss Amy with me.
[09:07.980 --> 09:09.460]  I brought her with me as my date.
[09:09.460 --> 09:13.620]  So I had to be sure to find her a good, comfortable seat and make sure that she was well taken
[09:13.620 --> 09:15.100]  care of while I was on stage.
[09:15.100 --> 09:16.380]  I couldn't just abandon her.
[09:16.380 --> 09:19.820]  I had to make sure she was comfortable and that they knew she was my girl and they were
[09:19.820 --> 09:21.260]  taking good care of her.
[09:21.260 --> 09:23.560]  So I got her all set up with my friends at the club.
[09:23.560 --> 09:29.160]  And then they took me to the green room where I ran into Jeff Tate and eventually Doug Benson.
[09:29.160 --> 09:31.760]  We went out and smoked a little bit because that's what we do.
[09:31.760 --> 09:36.040]  When I went back to the green room, I ran into Taylor Tomlinson and her fiance.
[09:36.040 --> 09:38.540]  We had a long, funny conversation.
[09:38.540 --> 09:42.000]  Eventually Doug Benson and his girlfriend and Jeff Tate all stumbled into the green
[09:42.000 --> 09:43.000]  room.
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.160]  We hung out for a few.
[09:44.160 --> 09:48.000]  Right before showtime, we all stepped out of the back door of Comedy Works.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.240]  Taylor Tomlinson did not consume any cannabis.
[09:50.240 --> 09:51.640]  I should probably be clear about that.
[09:51.640 --> 09:52.800]  She did not join us.
[09:52.800 --> 09:56.920]  It was Jeff Tate, Doug Benson, and myself all out back smoking a little reefer.
[09:56.920 --> 09:58.600]  I'm not snitching on anybody there.
[09:58.600 --> 09:59.600]  Everybody knows those guys are potheads.
[09:59.600 --> 10:01.760]  That's why I want to make sure nobody thinks Taylor was back there.
[10:01.760 --> 10:02.920]  She was not smoking with us.
[10:02.920 --> 10:03.920]  I just want to be clear.
[10:03.920 --> 10:06.520]  I don't know her stance or position, but she did not consume.
[10:06.520 --> 10:08.280]  I don't want to get her in any trouble.
[10:08.280 --> 10:09.860]  So we all went and got stoned.
[10:09.860 --> 10:11.480]  Then Doug goes and starts the show.
[10:11.480 --> 10:13.660]  Doug does a few minutes of his own time.
[10:13.660 --> 10:16.320]  I would guess Doug did about 10 or 15, maybe 20 minutes.
[10:16.320 --> 10:18.040]  He goes out and gets the crowd warmed up.
[10:18.040 --> 10:21.400]  He does a few advertisements, talks about shows he's got coming up, talks about the
[10:21.400 --> 10:22.400]  sponsors.
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.520]  Then he brings out the guests.
[10:24.520 --> 10:25.880]  He brought out Taylor Tomlinson.
[10:25.880 --> 10:29.760]  He introduced me as Rasta Jeff and of course Jeff Tate.
[10:29.760 --> 10:32.440]  It felt really fun to walk out and just sit on the stool.
[10:32.440 --> 10:33.800]  A few people knew who I was.
[10:33.800 --> 10:35.840]  Quite a few people seemed to know who I was.
[10:35.840 --> 10:40.240]  It was really fun just to be on the stage with Doug Benson, who is kind of my ... He's
[10:40.240 --> 10:41.240]  my friend.
[10:41.240 --> 10:44.560]  We only hang out once or twice a year, but he knows who I am, obviously.
[10:44.560 --> 10:47.040]  It was really comfortable just to be chilling next to him.
[10:47.040 --> 10:49.840]  Jeff Tate is one of my favorite guests on that podcast.
[10:49.840 --> 10:51.800]  I listen to every episode of that podcast.
[10:52.200 --> 10:53.200]  I play along with the games.
[10:53.200 --> 10:57.400]  It is one of my favorite podcasts to listen to when I am in the garden, I got the earbuds
[10:57.400 --> 10:58.400]  in.
[10:58.400 --> 11:00.680]  I'm trying to listen to the games and have a good time and participate.
[11:00.680 --> 11:02.400]  Jeff Tate is one of my favorite guests.
[11:02.400 --> 11:05.240]  Also, he is fierce competition in the games.
[11:05.240 --> 11:06.280]  He is known for winning.
[11:06.280 --> 11:09.960]  There are only a couple other guys that have a better reputation for taking the games than
[11:09.960 --> 11:10.960]  him.
[11:10.960 --> 11:13.280]  It was really fun to be on the show with Jeff Tate.
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.200]  Taylor Tomlinson was really sweet and really fun and really nice and really inviting.
[11:18.400 --> 11:21.520]  When I was in the green room with her, it didn't feel like I was in the green room with
[11:21.520 --> 11:22.960]  some famous comedian.
[11:22.960 --> 11:25.840]  It felt like I was just hanging out with some people that I had just met.
[11:25.840 --> 11:29.240]  We're all just chilling out, having a good time, doing a little show together.
[11:29.240 --> 11:30.240]  That was a great time.
[11:30.240 --> 11:31.700]  I got comfortable on the stage.
[11:31.700 --> 11:33.360]  We all introduced ourselves.
[11:33.360 --> 11:35.800]  Doug gave me a moment to talk about my podcast.
[11:35.800 --> 11:37.440]  I got to talk about my seeds.
[11:37.440 --> 11:39.560]  Earlier, I mentioned the prize bag.
[11:39.560 --> 11:44.160]  Since it is Colorado, I was able to put two packs of seeds into the prize bag.
[11:44.160 --> 11:46.760]  I threw a 10-pack of Arise into that prize bag.
[11:46.760 --> 11:49.440]  I also threw in a 10-pack of Sonic Boom.
[11:49.440 --> 11:53.160]  I don't know that the guy who won will ever grow those, but I got to talk about them on
[11:53.160 --> 11:55.640]  the show, so it was well worth it.
[11:55.640 --> 11:59.440]  There was a lot of fun conversation at the start of the show, some jokes about my dreadlocks.
[11:59.440 --> 12:03.520]  Taylor Tomlinson called me the stoner Tarzan, which I thought was great.
[12:03.520 --> 12:04.960]  A lot of people laughed at that one.
[12:04.960 --> 12:06.580]  She said it was a compliment.
[12:06.580 --> 12:11.320]  She is just adorable, so everything she says I take as a compliment.
[12:11.320 --> 12:16.320]  Then after a few jokes, after a few minutes, we got to the game portion of the show.
[12:16.320 --> 12:20.040]  I have been listening to the Doug Loves Movies podcast for several years.
[12:20.040 --> 12:25.760]  I have attended probably 10 or 15 live tapings of that show, but I do not watch a lot of
[12:25.760 --> 12:32.960]  movies, so I was really questioning my ability to do well in the movie-based trivia games.
[12:32.960 --> 12:37.320]  I don't want to brag too much here on my show, but I did pretty damn well for not knowing
[12:37.320 --> 12:39.520]  a whole lot about movies.
[12:39.520 --> 12:42.720]  I know I've already talked a whole lot about the episode, but I hope you guys go listen
[12:42.720 --> 12:47.640]  to Doug Loves Movies, episode 1172.
[12:47.640 --> 12:51.520]  It is Taylor Tomlinson, Rasta Jeff, and Jeff Tate as guests.
[12:51.520 --> 12:54.080]  It is live from Comedy Works in Denver.
[12:54.080 --> 12:58.200]  Right now, it is the second episode in the feed, and it came out Monday.
[12:58.200 --> 13:01.640]  If you were on iTunes or Stitcher, you should be able to find that pretty easily.
[13:01.640 --> 13:05.800]  It is the Doug Loves Movies podcast, episode 1172.
[13:05.800 --> 13:07.600]  I encourage you to listen to that one.
[13:07.600 --> 13:10.960]  See how well I did on the games, but also see how much fun I had.
[13:10.960 --> 13:13.520]  I had the time of my life on that podcast.
[13:13.520 --> 13:15.800]  I really did not expect to be a guest on the show.
[13:15.800 --> 13:19.480]  I didn't find out until my way to Denver, so it was really fun.
[13:19.480 --> 13:22.240]  I was unprepared, but I think that was best because I just walked in.
[13:22.240 --> 13:23.240]  I was like, hey, I'm here.
[13:23.240 --> 13:24.240]  They're like, cool, go back there.
[13:24.240 --> 13:26.960]  I went into the green room, and they're like, cool, let's go on stage.
[13:26.960 --> 13:28.880]  It all just happened super smooth.
[13:28.880 --> 13:32.600]  Like I said earlier, I don't think I realized it was even happening until I was on the stage
[13:32.600 --> 13:34.080]  and it was happening.
[13:34.080 --> 13:38.520]  I don't think it hit me that it had happened until Monday when the episode came out.
[13:38.520 --> 13:40.960]  I was like, oh, wow, I was on that podcast.
[13:40.960 --> 13:42.120]  I got to listen to it.
[13:42.120 --> 13:43.880]  A lot of it, I really didn't remember.
[13:43.880 --> 13:47.440]  Once it started happening, I was like, oh, I do remember that, but it was such a blur.
[13:47.440 --> 13:48.440]  I had so much fun.
[13:48.440 --> 13:52.080]  There was so much adrenaline, so much excitement, and so much laughter that I couldn't even
[13:52.080 --> 13:53.080]  pay attention.
[13:53.080 --> 13:57.640]  I owe a big, huge thank you to Doug Benson for letting me be on his Doug Loves Movies
[13:57.640 --> 13:58.640]  podcast.
[13:58.640 --> 14:01.840]  Also, I owe a big, huge shout out to all of my friends at Comedy Works.
[14:01.840 --> 14:03.480]  They have always treated me like a rock star.
[14:03.880 --> 14:07.760]  They've always treated me like a VIP, but once I was a guest on the show and I was actually
[14:07.760 --> 14:11.080]  backstage, I was treated like a celebrity and that was awesome.
[14:11.080 --> 14:12.960]  Big thanks to all my friends there.
[14:12.960 --> 14:16.400]  Then after the show, there was an amazing little smoke.
[14:16.400 --> 14:21.160]  Let's say allegedly, there may have been a smoke session in the alley behind Comedy Works
[14:21.160 --> 14:26.760]  with Doug Benson, Jeff Tate, myself, and probably 90% of the crowd.
[14:26.760 --> 14:30.320]  We all congregated out behind Comedy Works out by the dumpster there because that seems
[14:30.320 --> 14:32.040]  to be the classy place.
[14:32.040 --> 14:34.920]  We smoked down and took pictures.
[14:34.920 --> 14:38.760]  It was kind of awkward because a lot of people asked me to sign autographs.
[14:38.760 --> 14:41.800]  I'm not used to that yet, but it is really fun.
[14:41.800 --> 14:42.800]  It feels kind of silly.
[14:42.800 --> 14:45.880]  It feels kind of strange, but honestly, it is super exciting.
[14:45.880 --> 14:51.120]  It means a lot to me that people were excited to shake my hand and take a picture with me.
[14:51.120 --> 14:52.120]  People were like, dude, you're funny.
[14:52.120 --> 14:54.520]  I didn't even realize I was saying anything funny on stage.
[14:54.520 --> 14:57.080]  I was just trying not to say anything stupid.
[14:57.080 --> 15:00.720]  everybody to be complimenting me and be super excited to meet me and take a picture with
[15:00.720 --> 15:01.720]  me.
[15:01.720 --> 15:02.720]  The weirdest part is signing autographs.
[15:02.720 --> 15:03.720]  I'm still not.
[15:03.720 --> 15:04.760]  I don't think I'll ever get used to that.
[15:04.760 --> 15:08.400]  I'm always down to take a picture and shake your hand, but signing autographs feels really
[15:08.400 --> 15:09.400]  weird.
[15:09.400 --> 15:10.400]  I'll do it, but that is new to me.
[15:10.400 --> 15:13.760]  I don't know if that will ever feel like a natural thing.
[15:13.760 --> 15:17.080]  I had a great time being a guest on the Doug Loves Movies podcast.
[15:17.080 --> 15:21.280]  I got to meet a lot of great people after the show, something I laughed at.
[15:21.280 --> 15:25.800]  As soon as Amy and I walked up to the comedy club, there was a couple standing in front
[15:25.800 --> 15:27.160]  smoking a cigarette.
[15:27.160 --> 15:28.160]  They saw me.
[15:28.160 --> 15:31.600]  The guy looked at me and he said, hey, dude, are you a guest on the show tonight?
[15:31.600 --> 15:35.080]  I don't think I was supposed to tell anybody that I was a guest, but at that point, I didn't
[15:35.080 --> 15:36.080]  know what to say.
[15:36.080 --> 15:38.080]  I go, I don't think I'm supposed to talk about that.
[15:38.080 --> 15:39.600]  He laughed and he introduced himself.
[15:39.600 --> 15:40.600]  We had a fun conversation.
[15:40.600 --> 15:45.360]  Him, his wife, and Amy and myself hung out for a few minutes, just hanging out for a
[15:45.360 --> 15:46.760]  few in front of the comedy club.
[15:46.760 --> 15:49.560]  I was a little bit early and he was early, so he was smoking a cigarette.
[15:49.560 --> 15:53.560]  I was just chilling out, catching the breeze and enjoying the sunshine before I went in.
[15:53.560 --> 15:57.000]  I thought it was really funny that he knew who I was and he asked if I was going to
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.440]  be on the show.
[15:58.440 --> 16:01.760]  I think Doug tries to keep it a secret, so I wasn't sure if I was supposed to say, yeah,
[16:01.760 --> 16:02.760]  I'm on the show.
[16:02.760 --> 16:05.600]  I really wasn't sure how to react, so I said, I don't know how I'm supposed to react to
[16:05.600 --> 16:06.600]  that dude.
[16:06.600 --> 16:11.040]  I think he knew by my reaction, but I didn't snitch on myself, so that was fun.
[16:11.040 --> 16:12.500]  The smoke out after was a great time.
[16:12.500 --> 16:14.000]  The podcast was a great time.
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  Meeting everybody was a really great time.
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.080]  I wasn't ready for that.
[16:17.080 --> 16:20.920]  I did not realize that I was going to shake hands with everybody at Comedy Works that
[16:20.920 --> 16:21.920]  night.
[16:21.920 --> 16:22.920]  That was super cool.
[16:23.280 --> 16:24.280]  I want to say thanks to Doug again.
[16:24.280 --> 16:25.280]  Big thanks to Comedy Works.
[16:25.280 --> 16:27.680]  Big thanks to Jeff Tate and Taylor Tomlinson.
[16:27.680 --> 16:28.920]  I owe a big shout out to Amy.
[16:28.920 --> 16:31.640]  I took Amy to that comedy show as my date.
[16:31.640 --> 16:34.680]  She thought she was going to go and hang out with me and sit next to me and hold my hand
[16:34.680 --> 16:36.720]  through the show and look at me and laugh.
[16:36.720 --> 16:37.720]  I ditched her.
[16:37.720 --> 16:39.640]  I abandoned her and I ended up on stage.
[16:39.640 --> 16:43.400]  I made sure that that club treated her like a queen, so she got a great seat.
[16:43.400 --> 16:48.060]  I selected her name tag during the name tag portion of the show, so I made sure to show
[16:48.060 --> 16:51.760]  her that she was getting all kinds of love, even though I was up on stage playing rock
[16:51.760 --> 16:53.180]  star for a few minutes.
[16:53.180 --> 16:54.320]  Big shout out to Amy.
[16:54.320 --> 16:55.320]  Thanks for letting me have fun.
[16:55.320 --> 16:56.760]  Thanks for taking that well.
[16:56.760 --> 17:00.240]  She got a front row seat and I saw the smile on her face, so that was awesome.
[17:00.240 --> 17:02.080]  Then the drive home was super fun.
[17:02.080 --> 17:03.080]  Everybody was giddy.
[17:03.080 --> 17:06.400]  Amy had a big smile on her face because she had just smoked with Doug Benson and Jeff
[17:06.400 --> 17:08.240]  Tate and seen a great comedy show.
[17:08.240 --> 17:12.840]  I had a big smile on my face because I got to be on one of my favorite podcasts.
[17:12.840 --> 17:14.200]  I think it was a great success.
[17:14.200 --> 17:15.840]  I think it was a wonderful evening.
[17:15.840 --> 17:20.200]  I never expected, anticipated, or planned on being on that podcast.
[17:20.200 --> 17:24.640]  Getting up and just walking into the green room, walking onto the stage, that felt amazing.
[17:24.640 --> 17:28.840]  Again, I don't think I even realized it happened or was happening until Monday when I looked
[17:28.840 --> 17:31.600]  and the podcast was live on iTunes and I listened to it.
[17:31.600 --> 17:33.560]  I was like, well, I really did that.
[17:33.560 --> 17:34.560]  That was a good time.
[17:34.560 --> 17:38.400]  I know I've talked for 15 minutes about an hour and a half podcast that I was on, but
[17:38.400 --> 17:39.400]  it was a great time.
[17:39.400 --> 17:40.680]  I wanted to share that with my friends.
[17:40.680 --> 17:44.480]  I wanted to make sure to say thank you to the important people that deserve the thanks.
[17:44.480 --> 17:46.320]  Big thanks to Doug Benson again.
[17:46.320 --> 17:48.280]  Thanks to Jeff Tate, Taylor Tomlinson.
[17:48.280 --> 17:51.080]  Of course, a big shout out to all of my friends at Comedy Works.
[17:51.080 --> 17:54.360]  An extra big shout out to Miss Amy for making the night extra perfect.
[17:54.360 --> 17:56.840]  All right, you guys, I do have more stuff to talk about.
[17:56.840 --> 18:00.800]  I hope you were still listening after I just rambled for 15 minutes about being on a podcast.
[18:00.800 --> 18:02.240]  I hope you didn't get bored with that.
[18:02.240 --> 18:03.240]  Thanks for listening to me.
[18:03.240 --> 18:04.520]  I just wanted to talk about how much fun I have.
[18:04.520 --> 18:06.680]  I used to talk about all kinds of comedy shows.
[18:06.680 --> 18:08.760]  I haven't gotten to do something like that in a while.
[18:08.760 --> 18:10.080]  Really meant a lot to me.
[18:10.080 --> 18:12.280]  Let's talk about the next fun event that is coming up.
[18:12.280 --> 18:15.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you listen to the Dude Grows show, you know that we have got
[18:15.880 --> 18:23.200]  the Dude Grows show, concentration celebration coming up on July 13th at Cultivated Synergy.
[18:23.200 --> 18:24.320]  I will be there.
[18:24.320 --> 18:25.800]  Scotty Real will be there.
[18:25.800 --> 18:28.200]  Hopefully the Dude will make it down from Canada.
[18:28.200 --> 18:29.560]  Guru will be there.
[18:29.560 --> 18:31.200]  The Dude Grows crew will be there.
[18:31.200 --> 18:32.640]  I hope you will come join us.
[18:32.640 --> 18:37.080]  Come hang out at the Dude Grows concentration celebration.
[18:37.080 --> 18:42.360]  Join us in a celebration and an educational experience about concentrates.
[18:42.360 --> 18:43.520]  We've got a lot of great ideas.
[18:43.520 --> 18:44.520]  We've got a lot of great people.
[18:44.920 --> 18:46.760]  A lot of great companies coming out.
[18:46.760 --> 18:52.280]  If you are into concentrates, if you are a concentrate connoisseur, a concentrate producer,
[18:52.280 --> 18:56.200]  if you just want to smoke some dabs and meet some people, if you are into the Dude Grows
[18:56.200 --> 19:00.280]  show or the Grow From Your Heart podcast, if you are into cannabis culture and community,
[19:00.280 --> 19:06.600]  I think you will have a great time at the Dude Grows show, concentration celebration.
[19:06.600 --> 19:07.600]  Come hang out.
[19:07.600 --> 19:08.800]  Come take a fat dab.
[19:08.800 --> 19:09.880]  Come grab some seeds.
[19:09.880 --> 19:11.060]  Come meet some friends.
[19:11.060 --> 19:12.960]  Come learn all about concentrates.
[19:12.960 --> 19:13.960]  Join us.
[19:14.400 --> 19:16.160]  Thank you and I look forward to seeing you there.
[19:16.160 --> 19:21.320]  For all of the information that you do need, make sure you check out dudegrows.com.
[19:21.320 --> 19:24.480]  They will have all the ticket info, all the event info.
[19:24.480 --> 19:25.720]  Post it up very soon.
[19:25.720 --> 19:29.960]  I want to give a huge shout out to my buddy Scotty Real for putting together this event.
[19:29.960 --> 19:35.400]  This event started off as a kind of a carbon copy of the original Dude Grows cup, but we
[19:35.400 --> 19:39.760]  realized that we had to change up a few things and it took a lot more effort than we anticipated
[19:39.760 --> 19:43.520]  and it is becoming a really great event because we had to try harder.
[19:43.520 --> 19:45.800]  It made it become an even better event.
[19:45.800 --> 19:50.040]  So I look forward to seeing you, Scotty, the Dude Grows crew, the whole Irie Army and the
[19:50.040 --> 19:57.240]  Grow From Your Heart crew at the Dude Grows concentration celebration, July 13th at Cultivated
[19:57.240 --> 19:58.240]  Synergy.
[19:58.240 --> 20:02.240]  All right, that is a great way to segue into the next note I have got written down.
[20:02.240 --> 20:07.800]  The next note says, tell them about your breeding project and upcoming strains and drop.
[20:07.800 --> 20:08.800]  What?
[20:08.800 --> 20:09.800]  That's right.
[20:09.800 --> 20:15.880]  Around the same time as the Dude Grows concentration celebration, I will have some new seeds available.
[20:15.880 --> 20:16.880]  That's right.
[20:16.880 --> 20:19.600]  I will have Golden Goat feminized seeds available.
[20:19.600 --> 20:23.400]  I will have more Lemon Jeffrey feminized seeds available.
[20:23.400 --> 20:27.320]  I'm also going to release the brand new Orange Gasm.
[20:27.320 --> 20:30.120]  It will be released live at the 710 Cup.
[20:30.120 --> 20:35.360]  It will be available online on 710, but the first place you can get your hands on it will
[20:35.360 --> 20:41.240]  be at the Dude Grows concentration celebration on 713 at Cultivated Synergy.
[20:41.240 --> 20:45.960]  So come say what's up, visit my booth, grab yourself a pack of Golden Goat feminized seeds,
[20:45.960 --> 20:52.020]  get some Lemon Jeffrey fem seeds, and check out that brand new Orange Gasm feminized seeds.
[20:52.020 --> 20:53.020]  What is Orange Gasm?
[20:53.020 --> 20:54.020]  What?
[20:54.020 --> 20:57.640]  That one is platinum tangy pollinated by a reversed Golden Goat.
[20:57.640 --> 21:03.080]  Oh my goodness, it makes the most ridiculous orange sweet candy.
[21:03.080 --> 21:07.400]  It's almost like an orange marmalade, almost like a sweet orange covered in sugar.
[21:07.400 --> 21:08.820]  It is just potent and pungent.
[21:08.820 --> 21:10.080]  It is covered in trichomes.
[21:10.080 --> 21:11.360]  It makes big giant buds.
[21:11.360 --> 21:13.020]  It grows super easily.
[21:13.020 --> 21:15.120]  It takes about eight or nine weeks to finish.
[21:15.120 --> 21:17.840]  I think Orange Gasm is amazing.
[21:17.840 --> 21:20.760]  Hopefully you find that O-Face Pheno in the package.
[21:20.760 --> 21:21.760]  They'll be ready.
[21:21.760 --> 21:27.840]  They will be available at the Dude Grows concentration celebration on 713, and they should be available
[21:27.840 --> 21:31.080]  online at select vendors by 710.
[21:32.080 --> 21:35.640]  All right, podcast world, that is all I've got for you for this quick Thursday episode.
[21:35.640 --> 21:38.360]  Thanks for listening to me talk about the Doug Loves Movies podcast.
[21:38.360 --> 21:42.120]  I hope you go listen to the full episode, have some laughs on me.

[22:07.400 --> 22:08.960]  nonsense, you can send me an email.
[22:08.960 --> 22:12.340]  My email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.

[22:14.400 --> 22:16.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be back Monday with a fresh new episode.
[22:16.600 --> 22:20.160]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friends Jordan and Baker.
[22:20.160 --> 22:23.560]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
