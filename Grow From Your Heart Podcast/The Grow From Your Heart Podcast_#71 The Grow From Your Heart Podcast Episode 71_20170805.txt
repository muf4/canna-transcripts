[00:12.410 --> 00:23.930]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community. It's time for episode number 71 of the Grow From
[00:23.930 --> 00:29.490]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education and conversation. That's right.
[00:29.490 --> 00:33.010]  If you're a new grower and if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[00:33.010 --> 00:36.690]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:36.690 --> 00:41.530]  state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.530 --> 00:44.970]  Thanks again for joining me. As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to
[00:44.970 --> 00:49.050]  the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big thanks to Kat,
[00:49.050 --> 00:53.570]  Ku and the entire Mystic Roots crew. You guys are listening to the doggy dub off the album
[00:53.570 --> 00:57.170]  The Constant Struggle. Make sure you check those guys out for me. It's the Mystic Roots
[00:57.170 --> 01:02.210]  band. Send them some love. What's going on guys? I am coming to you all by myself today.
[01:02.210 --> 01:08.410]  I do not have a guest. I'm going to do an episode about ways to improve your garden.
[01:08.410 --> 01:11.610]  One way to improve your garden is to use organic soil amendments. Where do you get organic
[01:11.610 --> 01:15.730]  soil amendments? You can get your organic soil amendments from the Rocky Mountain Worm
[01:15.730 --> 01:19.570]  Company. The organic portions of this episode were brought to you by my friends at the Rocky
[01:19.570 --> 01:23.690]  Mountain Worm Company. Visit the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in Colorado Springs to get your
[01:23.690 --> 01:28.210]  fresh worm castings, African night crawlers, red wigglers and all of your organic soil
[01:28.210 --> 01:32.330]  amendments. The Rocky Mountain Worm Company has Dragonfly Earth Medicine products in stock

[02:01.810 --> 02:05.410]  and I'll get you all that information. I would like to take a second now. I'm going to turn
[02:05.410 --> 02:10.370]  on that music and we are going to read an iTunes comment. It's going to take me a second
[02:10.370 --> 02:15.170]  to get there. It's a couple of clicks away. Oh, it went away. I got to search for it again.
[02:15.170 --> 02:20.810]  I can't play the opening music and have this up at the same time. I'm just not a multitasker.
[02:20.810 --> 02:24.010]  My computer didn't like that. They're both coming from iTunes. I had to leave the screen.
[02:24.010 --> 02:28.690]  Anyway, I'm going to it. I promise I'm just talking while I do it. Ratings and reviews.
[02:28.690 --> 02:32.090]  We're going to scroll down here. We're going to turn on the music as soon as I get to it.
[02:32.090 --> 02:38.490]  All right, check this out. The latest review says from iTunes by Mr. Minor. This was left
[02:38.490 --> 02:42.990]  on April 23rd. He left me a five star rating and it says, I found this podcast recently
[02:42.990 --> 02:48.290]  and I just love it. Jeff is articulate, thoughtful, considerate, and he has a deep knowledge base
[02:48.290 --> 02:53.150]  that he shares selflessly. This is a true gem. I love plugging in and kicking back while
[02:53.150 --> 02:58.530]  listening to all the information and fun. Thanks for doing it. Thank you, Mr. Minor.
[02:58.530 --> 03:03.490]  I definitely appreciate you messaging or leaving a comment and saying that you love the show.
[03:03.490 --> 03:09.370]  That's really great that you notice I am sharing this selflessly. I've gotten a lot of credit
[03:09.370 --> 03:14.470]  for that. I learned a lot. It took me a long time to learn this. I feel like that I want
[03:14.470 --> 03:21.170]  to, I think I'm bettering the plant and medical marijuana and recreational marijuana by teaching
[03:21.170 --> 03:24.610]  everybody to grow better cannabis. I think that's my goal. Thanks for noticing is what
[03:24.610 --> 03:28.170]  I'm trying to say. Thanks for the comment. Thanks for the five stars. That's really fucking
[03:28.210 --> 03:33.610]  cool. Yes. Thanks for the comment guys. Leave a comment on iTunes and I will read that on
[03:33.610 --> 03:39.330]  a future episode. If you don't want to leave a comment on iTunes, you can go to Twitter.
[03:39.330 --> 03:44.050]  You can go to Facebook. You can email me. There are a lot of ways to get in touch with
[03:44.050 --> 03:49.850]  me. It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com. It's at GFYH podcast or search for grow from
[03:49.850 --> 03:54.810]  your heart on Facebook. If you want to follow me on Instagram, it's at I read genetics.
[03:54.810 --> 03:59.050]  Um, yeah, that's a lot of, uh, social media stuff there. Let's move on a little bit. I
[03:59.050 --> 04:04.330]  want to talk about our main subject for the day. Let's talk a little bit about ways to
[04:04.330 --> 04:08.930]  improve your crop. As I opened my phone, I just saw the most terrible tweet. You guys,
[04:08.930 --> 04:13.810]  um, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the legend, I'm going to kill the music here
[04:13.810 --> 04:20.210]  and say this, I'm making sure this is true. Yeah, it's true. You guys, um, I have to tell
[04:20.210 --> 04:22.730]  you this on the podcast. You've already heard this cause this episode is going to come out
[04:22.730 --> 04:28.330]  in a week from now, but BB King has passed away. Blues legend, BB King is no longer with
[04:28.330 --> 04:32.010]  us. So I'm going to take a really brief moment of silence for BB King. And then I'll tell
[04:32.010 --> 04:36.170]  you about my favorite, uh, BB King performance I've ever seen. I'm going to take like just
[04:36.170 --> 04:39.490]  to brief this podcast. We can't do long moment of silence, but this is for BB King. Here
[04:39.490 --> 04:46.360]  we go. All right. That was out of respect because BB King, I'm a huge musician. I've
[04:46.360 --> 04:51.400]  played music for my whole life. I've been a drummer for, I've been a drummer longer
[04:51.400 --> 04:55.760]  than I have not been a drummer. I got drums for my 15th birthday and it was all I cared
[04:55.760 --> 05:00.440]  about for probably 10, maybe 15, 20 years was the drums. It was all that mattered. And
[05:00.440 --> 05:06.280]  then I had a daughter and that changed some shit. Uh, so I used to play in a band called
[05:06.280 --> 05:11.320]  the Chrome Benders with a guy named Brian Ritchie and Donovan McNeely and Kenny Nicholson.
[05:11.320 --> 05:14.760]  And there were other guys that rotated in and out of that band, but those were, and
[05:14.760 --> 05:19.560]  our bass player was Dennis. Can't forget the bass guy. Um, there were several guys, Dennis
[05:19.560 --> 05:23.640]  Morgan, by the way, there are several guys that rotated in and out of that band, but
[05:23.640 --> 05:27.840]  Brian Ritchie and I were always in that band together. And we used to do the thrill is
[05:27.840 --> 05:32.920]  gone, which is a BB King tune. And Oh man, we would play the shit out of it. And there's
[05:32.920 --> 05:38.080]  something BB wrote amazing songs. I want to talk about my favorite BB King, a musical
[05:38.080 --> 05:43.020]  moment that I've seen. I did not get to see BB King on stage. Uh, there were so many shows
[05:43.020 --> 05:46.520]  that I chose to go to that I had to skip some, I've seen a lot of fish and mo and widespread
[05:46.520 --> 05:50.520]  panic and stuff along that lines, but I skipped all the BB King chances and now I kind of
[05:50.520 --> 05:57.760]  regret it. Uh, I saw him on the HBO 25th anniversary of the rock and roll hall of fame show. I
[05:57.760 --> 06:02.080]  don't remember the exact title, but those words are in there. It's the 25th anniversary,
[06:02.080 --> 06:07.440]  the rock and roll hall of fame, uh, Stevie wonders band performed and several musicians
[06:07.440 --> 06:11.760]  came out and perform with Stevie wonders band. And they do like a montage and then they bring
[06:11.760 --> 06:18.000]  out BB King and they did the thrill is gone. And there are some moments in that song when
[06:18.000 --> 06:22.840]  the hair on the back of my neck stands up. Uh, it's an amazing performance. So unfortunately
[06:22.840 --> 06:27.880]  guys, BB King has gone big shout out to BB King. Nobody liked him on that guitar. Uh,
[06:27.880 --> 06:32.040]  take a minute, listen to some BB, feel some blues. All right. I did not want to see that
[06:32.040 --> 06:36.520]  on the phone there right during a show, but they gave me some content, right? Let's see.
[06:36.520 --> 06:40.320]  Where was I? I'm throwing off now. Death is never a comforting feeling. All right. Ways
[06:40.320 --> 06:45.640]  to improve your crop. Let's change the vibe of this shit. Um, ways to improve our crop.
[06:45.640 --> 06:49.680]  Uh, you know, one major way to improve your crop and you guys are going to say you're
[06:49.680 --> 06:53.240]  a seed breeder. Of course you say that, but this is why I'm a seed breeder. A reason,
[06:53.240 --> 06:59.280]  a way to improve your crop is to use high quality genetics. Uh, get a clone from somebody
[06:59.280 --> 07:04.240]  you trust that has ran that clone. And it's a clone that you know is going to do well
[07:04.240 --> 07:09.480]  so that you're not wasting your time, wasting your space, wasting electricity, money, nutrients
[07:09.520 --> 07:14.520]  on a plant that isn't worth a shit. Get a good quality strain, good quality genetics.
[07:14.520 --> 07:21.800]  Um, of course I'm going to recommend some Irie genetics, some rare dankness. Um, I really
[07:21.800 --> 07:26.880]  like gauge green genetics, Laplata labs. Those are just a few of the brands that I really
[07:26.880 --> 07:30.040]  trust. There are a lot more. Uh, those are just a few off the top of my head that if
[07:30.040 --> 07:34.280]  I were going to grow from seed, those are the guys I would grab a gauge green Laplata
[07:34.280 --> 07:38.960]  labs. Uh, they're friends of mine and I trust their shit. Irie genetics of course is my
[07:38.960 --> 07:44.320]  brand. I trust my shit. Get some good trustworthy genetics. If you can go to kind love in Denver,
[07:44.320 --> 07:48.440]  they quite often have great genetics available. They have the lemon Jeffrey available. Get
[07:48.440 --> 07:53.000]  yourself a clone of that. You'll grow some amazing cannabis. So ways to improve your
[07:53.000 --> 07:59.200]  crop. Number one, use quality genetics. Um, part B to that is learn those genetics. Don't
[07:59.200 --> 08:04.040]  expect to pull off an amazing cannabis cup winning crop. The first time you grow a strain,
[08:04.040 --> 08:07.960]  you're going to have to learn it. Some plants want different shit at different times. You're
[08:07.960 --> 08:11.840]  going to have to figure out what the temperature and humidity is for that plant. That is ideal.
[08:11.840 --> 08:16.640]  You're going to have to figure out how long it takes to flower it. Uh, learn that plant,
[08:16.640 --> 08:19.840]  develop a relationship with it. Once you've got a relationship with that plant, you can
[08:19.840 --> 08:25.360]  really start dialing in the room, the nutrients, the time, uh, learn, learn the plant, use
[08:25.360 --> 08:31.260]  quality genetics and learn the genetics you're using. All right. Number two ways to improve
[08:31.260 --> 08:37.680]  your crop. This sounds like a no brainer guys, but label everything. You wouldn't believe
[08:37.680 --> 08:41.280]  how many times I thought I'll remember what that is. And then later on in the future,
[08:41.280 --> 08:44.920]  I don't know what the hell that clone is. I don't. And so now I'm trying to grow some
[08:44.920 --> 08:48.560]  random clone. I got to wait and see what it looks like when it flowers. I got to smell
[08:48.560 --> 08:54.440]  it, figure out what the hell it is. Label everything you guys. And also, uh, this is
[08:54.440 --> 08:59.300]  number three, but it's also kind of a part B of number two, take a lot of notes when
[08:59.300 --> 09:04.640]  you're labeling shit. Take a lot of notes. Uh, take notes of when that clone was cut.
[09:04.720 --> 09:08.440]  Take notes of when that clone went into a cup. Take notes of when that clone went into
[09:08.440 --> 09:14.200]  a pot. Take notes of when that pot is up, potted into a bigger pot. Um, take notes the
[09:14.200 --> 09:19.320]  day it went into flower. Take a lot of notes. I write down every feeding that I mix. I write
[09:19.320 --> 09:24.000]  that shit down so that if I see something amazing, I know what I did. I don't forget
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.520]  what I did last time. So make a lot of notes. You guys also, if you do any super cropping,
[09:29.520 --> 09:34.140]  any tweaking of the plants, any topping, any pinching, if you use any bug sprays, any shit
[09:34.140 --> 09:39.180]  like that, just write it down. That way when you have amazing results or shitty results,
[09:39.180 --> 09:42.460]  you have a record to look back on and you can look through the notes and go, Oh look,
[09:42.460 --> 09:46.100]  dude, here is right where we fucked up and you can find it and you can identify it and
[09:46.100 --> 09:51.620]  you can correct it. So label everything thoroughly and take notes. Uh, here's something that
[09:51.620 --> 09:57.780]  sounds obvious to me, but I've noticed a lot of people are ignoring this. I work as a consultant
[09:57.780 --> 10:01.220]  and people in my neighborhood can call me and invite me to their house and I do charge
[10:01.220 --> 10:05.660]  a small fee. Uh, but I will come look at your garden wherever it is and I will give
[10:05.660 --> 10:09.100]  you a little bit of advice or correct your issues or your problems and help you get back
[10:09.100 --> 10:14.580]  on the right track. One thing I often see is people do not pay any attention to the
[10:14.580 --> 10:20.660]  pH when you are mixing up your nutrients or your reservoir of clean water. Before that
[10:20.660 --> 10:28.020]  goes into the water, be or into your pots of plants, the pH needs to be adjusted. Um,
[10:28.020 --> 10:32.180]  if you're using organics, ignore this because the organics, you'll kill the organics by
[10:32.180 --> 10:37.700]  using anything to adjust it. Now organics will buffer themselves. They'll work themselves
[10:37.700 --> 10:42.680]  out. Excuse me guys. I'm burping. Okay, I'm better now. Um, so if you're using synthetic
[10:42.680 --> 10:46.940]  nutrients or bottled nutrients, make sure you pay attention to the pH. This is super
[10:46.940 --> 10:51.860]  critical in hydro and really important in soil. Either way, pay attention to your pH.
[10:51.860 --> 10:56.900]  When you mix up your water, when you mix up your nutrients, you want to have that final
[10:56.900 --> 11:02.580]  mix come out about 6.5 before you pour it into your plants. So put your new, fill your
[11:02.580 --> 11:06.780]  thing with water, put the desired nutrients in there at the desired amount. Check it with
[11:06.780 --> 11:10.340]  your PPM meter. If you're even using one of those, that's another thing to pay attention
[11:10.340 --> 11:15.100]  to your parts per million. We'll talk about that in the future. Check it with your PPM
[11:15.100 --> 11:20.420]  meter. Then put your pH meter in there. It's probably going to be a little bit high still.
[11:20.420 --> 11:24.900]  You need to get it down to about 6.5 so you're going to need to add something, probably a
[11:24.900 --> 11:29.980]  pH down product to that just a little bit at a time. Mix it up again, put your pH meter
[11:29.980 --> 11:34.880]  in there and do it until you're about 6.5. All right. If you're going hydro, you might
[11:34.880 --> 11:40.420]  want to go 5.8, 5.5 ish. I'm not the hydro expert yet, so don't quote me on that. I am
[11:40.420 --> 11:45.420]  definitely learning hydro, definitely learning quickly on the hydro because it's all we're
[11:45.420 --> 11:49.940]  doing at the spot. So pay attention to your pH, you guys, that I can see the problems
[11:49.940 --> 11:53.460]  in your leaves. When your leaves start doing stupid shit, it's usually usually because
[11:53.460 --> 11:59.620]  of pH. Then that's going to mimic other deficiencies. You're going to think, oh, I've got a CalMag
[11:59.620 --> 12:03.380]  deficiency or, oh, I've got a nitrogen deficiency, when really the only problem is that your
[12:03.380 --> 12:07.220]  pH of your feeding is off and your plants don't want to drink it. So your plants will
[12:07.220 --> 12:12.580]  react by showing you problems and you'll try to correct problems that don't even exist.
[12:12.580 --> 12:16.460]  Then you'll probably create more problems. So you guys make sure the pH is correct of
[12:16.460 --> 12:20.660]  your feeding. Also, something I should add to that, I'm going to skip ahead a little
[12:20.660 --> 12:26.180]  bit. Where is this note? Wow. I wrote a lot of stuff, you guys. Use clean water. This
[12:26.180 --> 12:31.220]  is something I can really stress right now since we're talking about pH. Use clean water.
[12:31.220 --> 12:35.420]  Most grows will recommend RO water if you can. That's reverse osmosis water, but that
[12:35.420 --> 12:40.460]  does require kind of an expensive filtration system. If you're just doing a small home
[12:40.460 --> 12:44.820]  grow, it's a little ridiculous, but the big growers will definitely recommend reverse
[12:44.820 --> 12:50.700]  osmosis. We've got, at the spot dispensary where I'm the grower there, we've got several
[12:50.700 --> 12:55.340]  thousand gallons of reverse osmosis water being cleaned all day. You wouldn't believe
[12:55.340 --> 13:00.220]  the water tanks we have. We've got, I think there are four 1,000 tanks in the RO room
[13:00.220 --> 13:06.380]  and they stay full. We pump that into separate rooms. Each room's got four 250-gallon tanks
[13:06.380 --> 13:10.860]  in it, which is where those dump into. So we're using a lot of RO water in there.
[13:10.860 --> 13:17.860]  If you're unable to get RO water, a good idea is to fill your reservoir and then put
[13:17.860 --> 13:22.740]  an air stone and air pump. Don't put the air pump in the water, you guys. Put the air stone
[13:22.740 --> 13:26.540]  in the water, put a little tubing to the air pump, plug the air pump in, and that will
[13:26.540 --> 13:32.480]  oxygenate your water. What that will do is it'll bring the water that's at the bottom
[13:32.480 --> 13:36.580]  to the top and it'll push the chlorine and whatever else they're putting in our water
[13:36.580 --> 13:39.860]  now. It'll clean that out for you a little bit. It'll bring it to the surface and the
[13:39.860 --> 13:43.900]  chlorine has to make it to the surface to evaporate. So putting some oxygen there will
[13:43.900 --> 13:48.820]  definitely help you out. Try to do that for at least 24 hours. It's always good to get
[13:48.820 --> 13:53.000]  the chlorine out before you mix any nutrients in there, or especially if you're making an
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.840]  organic tea, it's definitely a good idea to try to bubble out that chlorine as long as
[13:57.840 --> 14:04.180]  you can. I've almost always got a big, it's the Brute trash can. I've got a trash can
[14:04.180 --> 14:08.140]  on wheels and then I've got a little area with a little set up of water or a little
[14:08.140 --> 14:11.740]  bubble or set up next to it. And I just fill that trash can up and then I roll that over
[14:11.740 --> 14:16.460]  to this area and I just drop the air stones in it. So it's almost always filled with bubbling
[14:16.460 --> 14:20.580]  water and then I can mix into that if I need to, or I can make smaller portions in five
[14:20.580 --> 14:24.820]  gallon buckets out of that if I need to. I just try to keep that clean water on hand
[14:24.820 --> 14:29.260]  all the time. That's another thing. That's a good idea. I kind of skipped around on my
[14:29.260 --> 14:33.980]  notes, but this is going to help us out. This gets me back on track here. I said, have that
[14:33.980 --> 14:39.020]  water prepared. My next note is plan ahead and have your rooms ready and allow time for
[14:39.020 --> 14:44.740]  your plants to recover from topping and training. So that's two things in one there, but plan
[14:44.740 --> 14:49.820]  ahead to have your rooms ready. You're going to have plants that are vegging and they're
[14:49.820 --> 14:52.300]  going to start getting too tall and shit. And you're going to be like, I really need
[14:52.300 --> 14:56.080]  to flower these. That's when you're going to wish that you'd planned ahead and thought
[14:56.080 --> 15:00.020]  about this room is going to be done at this time. This done, this area will be done at
[15:00.020 --> 15:04.100]  this time. These plants will need to go here. Really try to plan ahead and think about what
[15:04.100 --> 15:08.380]  you're going to do with each plant and when you're going to do it. And that's a good time
[15:08.380 --> 15:12.780]  for me to tease and let you know that I have been working on the episode about scheduling
[15:12.780 --> 15:16.620]  a perpetual grow. I ran into a problem. I didn't know how to deal with the fact that
[15:16.620 --> 15:19.820]  I don't know how many lights you guys have. So how the hell am I going to write a schedule
[15:19.820 --> 15:24.020]  for your grow rooms, but I'm juggling it around and I think I've got the idea. We're just
[15:24.020 --> 15:27.720]  going to kind of condense it and make it a small grow. And then you guys can expand on
[15:27.720 --> 15:32.000]  it if you hang more lights, that's what we're going to have to do. So I was talking about
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.040]  planning ahead, having your rooms ready. And then the second part of that was allow time
[15:36.040 --> 15:40.680]  for your plants to recover from topping and training. So we're going to talk a little
[15:40.680 --> 15:46.360]  bit about topping training, super cropping, uh, scrogging tomato cages, using sticks for
[15:46.360 --> 15:52.400]  supports and LST a little bit. It's going to be just, I don't have any notes on this.
[15:52.400 --> 15:56.480]  So I'm just going to ramble about this part for a minute. Um, these are all methods that
[15:56.480 --> 16:01.320]  we would use to control the shape of our plant and the height of our plant, and also
[16:01.320 --> 16:06.400]  to improve the yield of our plant, uh, by keeping the plant instead of growing one huge
[16:06.400 --> 16:11.240]  Cola that sticks up and then having the rest of the plant kind of low. Uh, we want to kind
[16:11.240 --> 16:16.620]  of eliminate that one huge Cola and make a nice canopy so that the plant is getting even
[16:16.620 --> 16:21.560]  light and that there's not one bud blocking everything and taking up all the light and
[16:21.560 --> 16:28.360]  making shadows. We want to get one nice canopy. So ways to do that, um, are topping topping.
[16:28.360 --> 16:31.800]  I've talked about it a little bit when the plant starts to grow nodes. So you've got
[16:31.800 --> 16:35.360]  your main stock coming up and you've got a bunch of intersections. Those are nodes, all
[16:35.360 --> 16:40.360]  those branches that grow out. Those are nodes. If you go down a few nodes and cut out the
[16:40.360 --> 16:45.920]  main center stock, you have just now basically topped your plant and you've created multiple
[16:45.920 --> 16:53.800]  tops. Uh, cannabis wants one main top naturally. So all of the small tops that were sub tops
[16:53.800 --> 16:59.520]  will now start creeping up and try to become new dominant tops. So that's topping a plant.
[16:59.520 --> 17:04.080]  Um, I can't really explain it much better. You just grab the top, go from the top Cola
[17:04.080 --> 17:09.400]  and then just go down and then keep kind of look like kind of, if I cut it here, how many
[17:09.400 --> 17:14.720]  branches are going to be left and is it going to be kind of even? And then you can don't,
[17:14.720 --> 17:17.600]  don't be afraid to fuck up a couple, but don't go fucking up a bunch of them. Kind
[17:17.600 --> 17:21.000]  of top one and see what you like. Cut off a little bit at a time because you can cut
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.680]  more, but you can't put shit back on plants. So that's topping. Super cropping is kind
[17:26.680 --> 17:31.640]  of a, I learned super cropping from a guy named Soma. Super cropping is when you kind
[17:31.640 --> 17:36.160]  of take the stem of the plant and I rub it between my fingers to soften it. And then
[17:36.160 --> 17:40.560]  I pinch it a little to crack the stem. And then I honestly just push the branch right
[17:40.560 --> 17:44.880]  over at a 90 degree angle. So if I had one branch that was growing taller than the rest
[17:44.880 --> 17:50.360]  of my plants, I would find a spot just a little bit lower than the rest of the tops. And I
[17:50.360 --> 17:54.200]  would just break that branch right there and bend it over at a 90 degree angle. And for
[17:54.200 --> 17:57.240]  about a day, it's going to look like shit. It's going to look like it might die. But
[17:57.240 --> 18:01.000]  the next morning when the lights come on, you'll go in there and look and that branch
[18:01.000 --> 18:06.480]  will be perfectly horizontal. It'll be broken, bent at a 90 degree angle, perfectly horizontal.
[18:06.480 --> 18:11.120]  And the end of it will start growing right back up again toward the light. And now you've
[18:11.120 --> 18:15.480]  kind of straightened that out so that you'll have a more level, even canopy. And it also,
[18:15.480 --> 18:18.960]  where that branch was broken, I think it'll be a little bit stronger than it ever was
[18:18.960 --> 18:25.800]  before. That's a little bit of what super cropping is. Super cropping is also, I will
[18:25.800 --> 18:29.760]  grab the main stock of the plant where it comes out of the soil, and I'll put two fingers
[18:29.760 --> 18:34.380]  on it. And then I'll put two fingers above there and I will twist it and pop that branch
[18:34.380 --> 18:39.380]  until I hear a crack. And then I will move my hand, the hand that was on the bottom,
[18:39.380 --> 18:44.140]  I'll put it right above the hand that the other hand. So now I'm just grabbing up a
[18:44.140 --> 18:48.180]  little higher and just crack again. And then I'll take my left hand and put it right above
[18:48.180 --> 18:52.260]  my right hand and crack again and then put the right hand above the left and crack again.
[18:52.260 --> 18:56.820]  It's where I've cracked up this plant like 10 or 12 times right up the main stock. And
[18:56.820 --> 19:01.500]  what this does, it'll make little knuckles in there. And those are, they toughen up that
[19:01.500 --> 19:05.980]  stock. That main stock will get a little bit stronger. And I think a thicker stock
[19:05.980 --> 19:10.260]  that's a little bit stronger also can move more nutrients and it can also support bigger
[19:10.260 --> 19:15.060]  branches, which also can support bigger buds in the future. And that's our goal. So you
[19:15.060 --> 19:19.660]  can also do this to branches as well. I will grab the branch and just turn it just a little
[19:19.660 --> 19:23.220]  bit and you'll hear crunch, crunch, crunch, and you're just breaking that cellulose wall
[19:23.220 --> 19:26.980]  in there so that it has to rebuild. It sounds like you're popping your knuckle. It'll freak
[19:26.980 --> 19:30.620]  you out. Try not to do it too frequently. You have to let the plant heal from it once
[19:30.660 --> 19:35.300]  you do it. But if you've got time and space to veg and you're trying to keep your plants
[19:35.300 --> 19:41.140]  fat and healthy, super cropping is a really cool way to do it. Let's also talk a little
[19:41.140 --> 19:46.220]  bit about scrogging. We talked about scrogging when we had Spence on. This is all mostly
[19:46.220 --> 19:49.180]  canopy management stuff. We talked about this with Spencer, but I'm going to go over it
[19:49.180 --> 19:53.400]  again with you guys. Scrogging is when you use the screen or the net and you let your
[19:53.400 --> 19:57.460]  plants grow and then you kind of put the screen on them and push them down and then they just
[19:57.460 --> 20:01.380]  flatten out and then they start growing through the screen a little bit and you try to get
[20:01.380 --> 20:05.980]  one cola through each part of the screen and then you get that nice even canopy because
[20:05.980 --> 20:10.300]  our goal is to have an even canopy instead of one big cola. You want a bunch of small
[20:10.300 --> 20:15.280]  colas that get even light. It just helps out for the grow and those big buds aren't extra
[20:15.280 --> 20:19.480]  valuable or anything. They're actually kind of a pain in the ass for the grower. So we've
[20:19.480 --> 20:24.500]  talked about super cropping, topping, scrogging, tomato cages. I really like to use a tomato
[20:24.500 --> 20:29.380]  cage you guys because in a seven gallon pot, one of those, I think it's an 18 inch around
[20:29.380 --> 20:36.060]  tomato cage. It's a nice top and you can get, if you top the plant twice, you get about
[20:36.060 --> 20:40.300]  eight good heads off of the plant and you got just enough space around that tomato cage.
[20:40.300 --> 20:44.700]  You can use the cage to support the buds and you can also use the cage to pull the buds
[20:44.700 --> 20:49.140]  apart to get more light. If you spread those branches apart, you get more light to each
[20:49.140 --> 20:54.060]  bud. Try to use that square footage of your light space a little bit better. So I put
[20:54.060 --> 20:57.940]  the tomato cage on early and then I let it veg with the cage on and then I start pulling
[20:57.940 --> 21:02.180]  it out and strapping it up to the edges of the cage just to make room in there. And then
[21:02.180 --> 21:06.260]  you can use the cage to keep it supported or you can tie it into the cage to keep it
[21:06.260 --> 21:09.500]  up or you can tie it outside of the cage to keep it apart. The cage just really gives
[21:09.500 --> 21:15.480]  you a lot of opportunity and support and it's very versatile too. Also, I've talked about
[21:15.480 --> 21:19.900]  using bamboo sticks. A lot of times I'll just get some bamboo sticks in there, shove those
[21:19.900 --> 21:24.580]  right into the dirt, tie the branches up to there, pull them apart a little bit. Those
[21:24.580 --> 21:30.740]  are good ways to get more light to the plant. So topping, super cropping, scrogging tomato
[21:30.740 --> 21:37.540]  cages and just using regular sticks are good ways to pull the branches apart, get a little
[21:37.540 --> 21:41.620]  more canopy management, get more light down to the middle of the plant. And also I think
[21:41.620 --> 21:47.100]  pulling the big buds apart gives you a little more airspace and they really like that. LST
[21:47.100 --> 21:52.660]  is low stress training. That's kind of the scrog method also with a little bit of super
[21:52.660 --> 21:56.300]  cropping. So you want to just kind of bend and twist the plants a little bit to keep
[21:56.300 --> 22:00.740]  them in the shape you want and keep them low. The trick here is to make the plants low and
[22:00.740 --> 22:06.100]  bushy so that we can fill space and not use a lot of plants because in the medical game,
[22:06.100 --> 22:09.820]  it's all about plant counts. And in Colorado, in the rec game, you're allowed to have six
[22:09.820 --> 22:15.180]  plants and they don't care how big they are. So you can grow six fucking house size plants
[22:15.220 --> 22:19.460]  if you know how to do it. And a little bit of cropping, super cropping, LST kind of stuff
[22:19.460 --> 22:25.460]  will definitely do it for you. All right. We've kind of gone over the canopy management
[22:25.460 --> 22:29.860]  stuff so I was really quick on that. Another part that I can talk about, and we're going
[22:29.860 --> 22:32.980]  to wrap this episode up pretty quickly. I've noticed you guys like the 30 minute episodes
[22:32.980 --> 22:37.840]  better. One thing I should really talk about is pay attention to the room. Many problems
[22:37.840 --> 22:42.620]  are from the room or the environment that you've created. Be aware of the day and nighttime
[22:42.660 --> 22:47.740]  temperatures and the humidity through veg and bloom. Too low of humidity and veg will
[22:47.740 --> 22:52.460]  stunt the growth of your plants and it'll lead to deficiencies. It kind of mimics a
[22:52.460 --> 22:56.780]  deficiency when there's not enough humidity, the plants will mimic problems. And again,
[22:56.780 --> 23:00.460]  you'll be trying to correct something and really all you need to do is increase the
[23:00.460 --> 23:05.700]  humidity in the room. So too low humidity will stunt the plants, lead to deficiencies.
[23:05.700 --> 23:10.980]  Too much humidity will lead to mildew issues and it can also slow the growth of your plants
[23:10.980 --> 23:17.980]  and veg. So for veg, try to stay around 50% or above and max out around 75% humidity in
[23:19.940 --> 23:24.300]  veg. You can go a little higher, but that's when you start running the risk of problems.
[23:24.300 --> 23:30.980]  Try to keep it consistent. For the veg stage, try to keep temps around 74 to 77 degrees
[23:30.980 --> 23:37.540]  during the day period. Anywhere from 77 or 72 to 82 is okay for most strains, but what
[23:37.540 --> 23:43.620]  I've noticed is 74 to 77 degrees during the day is prime in my experience. All of my plants
[23:43.620 --> 23:50.020]  in veg, 74 to 77 degrees, they go nuts, they thrive. And keep in mind, this is just the
[23:50.020 --> 23:55.500]  room temperature. This is not leaf surface temperature. Leaf surface temperature is a
[23:55.500 --> 24:00.420]  whole nother story. We'll talk about that in another episode. So for the night cycle,
[24:00.420 --> 24:05.580]  try to get around 68 to 75 degrees guys. So I'll sum that up. In your veg, you want your
[24:05.580 --> 24:12.580]  temps 70 to 80 degrees for the day, 68 to 75 at night, and 50 to 75% humidity during
[24:13.620 --> 24:17.820]  the veg cycle. I'm going to interrupt myself and talk about something. When you walk in
[24:17.820 --> 24:24.820]  your grow room, if you can smell dirt and soil and pot and moist air and funk, you need
[24:26.540 --> 24:31.340]  more filtration. You need more air coming in and more air going out. It shouldn't smell
[24:31.340 --> 24:34.780]  like a pot garden in there. It might be a little bit humid and a little bit sticky,
[24:34.780 --> 24:39.220]  but you don't. If you can smell the pot garden in your pot garden, that means your neighbors
[24:39.220 --> 24:44.020]  can smell the pot garden down the block. So if you can walk in there and it smells like
[24:44.020 --> 24:49.260]  pot and it smells like soil, you need to get more carbon filters and pull more air out.
[24:49.260 --> 24:52.940]  And then you need to get more HIPAA filters and pull more air in because you're getting
[24:52.940 --> 24:57.460]  stagnant stale air in there. It should not smell like an old funky basement in your grow
[24:57.460 --> 25:03.180]  room. It should smell clean. That's just a random way to improve your grow. That's what
[25:03.180 --> 25:05.940]  we're focused on here. Sorry, my throat's burning up. I'm going to take a drink. It's
[25:05.940 --> 25:12.460]  always about 25 minutes, guys. The throat starts going nuts. And I didn't stop and take
[25:12.460 --> 25:16.540]  a dab in this episode. I tried to preserve the voice a little. I just need a guest. All
[25:16.540 --> 25:20.500]  right, let's get into the flowering phase here. For flowering, we need to make a few
[25:20.500 --> 25:25.340]  adjustments. For humidity, we need to get down to about 40 to 50% humidity. We don't
[25:25.340 --> 25:30.380]  need excess moisture in the room because that will cause mold or rot problems. You guys
[25:30.380 --> 25:34.420]  have heard about my white rhino experience. It's because there was too much moisture in
[25:34.420 --> 25:39.420]  the room and the temperatures got too low and that invited our mildew. So for the bloom
[25:39.420 --> 25:45.820]  phase, it is ideal to have temps hovering between 74 to 77 degrees during the day and
[25:45.820 --> 25:52.140]  66 to 75 degrees at night. Getting temps too high will slow the plants down again and too
[25:52.140 --> 25:56.320]  low will encourage mold and rot like I've said. If you're growing a strain that has
[25:56.320 --> 26:01.020]  purple characteristics, what you can do is you can lower the temps a little bit around
[26:01.020 --> 26:06.300]  week six or seven of flower and that'll definitely start bringing out the purple color in your
[26:06.300 --> 26:11.220]  plants. All right, that's enough about humidity and temperatures in your crop. I think you
[26:11.220 --> 26:16.300]  guys understand that. But those basic things will definitely improve your grow. A couple
[26:16.300 --> 26:20.580]  more quick tips before I wrap it up. Don't spray some shit on your plants in flower.
[26:20.580 --> 26:25.020]  If your plants are in flower, please do not spray them with any type of bug spray or anything
[26:25.020 --> 26:29.100]  like that. If you're going to hit them with a foliar spray, be really careful and really
[26:29.100 --> 26:35.540]  selective what you spray. Anytime after week three, really, that stuff is going to end
[26:35.540 --> 26:40.780]  up in your buds. Honestly, from the beginning of flower, there's not time for systemic chemicals
[26:40.780 --> 26:45.380]  to get out of your buds or off of your buds in my opinion. But if you're spraying something
[26:45.380 --> 26:50.340]  like fulvic acid and some sea kelp or something to try to increase things, that's not a bad
[26:50.340 --> 26:56.740]  idea. Just be careful when you do it. Don't spray bug sprays at all. Don't spray neem
[26:56.740 --> 27:02.100]  oil. Don't spray pesticides at all during flower. Only spray healthy, helpful foliar
[27:02.100 --> 27:07.820]  sprays and stop those around week five. Please, please, please, please. Also, something that
[27:07.820 --> 27:15.100]  I stress a lot to improve your cannabis, flush your plants before harvest. This is involved
[27:15.100 --> 27:20.460]  in planning. We've talked about planning your grow. Plan 14 days to flush your crop before
[27:20.460 --> 27:23.900]  you cut it down. This is super important. And then of course, I'm going to tell you
[27:23.900 --> 27:27.900]  another way to improve your crop is to cure your cannabis. Listen to the episode about
[27:27.900 --> 27:32.860]  drying and curing. That'll really, really help you out. Dry and cure your cannabis.
[27:32.860 --> 27:36.840]  Flush it, dry it and cure it. Another thing that may help you out guys, don't bring more
[27:36.840 --> 27:41.340]  people to your grow. Those people you bring in is where your bugs come from. And also
[27:41.340 --> 27:45.380]  here's another quick hint that's just coming out randomly. If you do get a clone from somebody,
[27:45.380 --> 27:49.260]  quarantine that bitch. Hit it with some bug spray. Check it for a couple of days and make
[27:49.260 --> 27:53.780]  sure there are no bugs on it before you introduce it to the general population of your garden.
[27:54.380 --> 27:59.280]  One bug, one russet mite coming into your garden, one russet mite into a new grower's
[27:59.280 --> 28:04.120]  garden could devastate everything. Your crop that is four weeks into flower could be decimated
[28:04.120 --> 28:07.940]  before you could save it. Your mother plants will be eaten. Your veg plants will be eaten.
[28:07.940 --> 28:12.140]  You'll have taken russet mites to all your buddies. It doesn't take much. So when you
[28:12.140 --> 28:16.220]  get a clone, quarantine that bitch. Don't bring friends over to your grow to show them
[28:16.220 --> 28:21.220]  because they're bringing powdery mildew, spider mites, root aphids, fucking white flies. They're
[28:21.220 --> 28:25.460]  all traveling on your buddy's clothes with you. So guys be careful in each other's gardens.
[28:25.460 --> 28:29.820]  Another tip about your garden to make it better. Just don't tell people about it. I know you
[28:29.820 --> 28:32.980]  want to show off your garden. You want to show off those big old buds. Make an anonymous
[28:32.980 --> 28:37.380]  Instagram account. Post the pictures to Instagram. Tag your friends or something in it. Just
[28:37.380 --> 28:40.460]  don't make it all braggy to where everybody knows who you are and what you're doing because
[28:40.460 --> 28:46.100]  word travels really, really quickly. All right. I know I post pictures of my shit and I talk
[28:46.100 --> 28:50.240]  all about it. I'm in Colorado. I grow for a facility. It's a different story. You guys.
[28:50.260 --> 28:53.240]  I'm out of the blue now or I'm out of the woodwork. Now I can talk about this. I'm out
[28:53.240 --> 28:57.680]  of the shadows. All right. I feel like I've done about 30 minutes now. Let's look and
[28:57.680 --> 29:01.280]  see how far we're into this. Look at that. 29 minutes. I'm getting good at podcasting.
[29:01.280 --> 29:05.240]  You guys. I think it's time to wrap up this show before my throat goes bananas before
[29:05.240 --> 29:10.040]  my ADD kicks in before your ADD kicks in. You know, we didn't do a dab on the show.
[29:10.040 --> 29:13.520]  We're going to move the iPhone out of the way. We're going to grab a dab. Let's do a
[29:13.520 --> 29:20.520]  dab together. You guys. I am going to dab some black cherry Kim that was grown. Dude,
[29:20.520 --> 29:25.680]  I bred this. I grew it. I was, was I involved in this extraction? No, this one was not extracted
[29:25.680 --> 29:28.960]  by me. This was done by my good friends at the garden of Whedon. Some of the hash I've
[29:28.960 --> 29:32.920]  had my hands in making. I can make myself some pretty decent BHO. I want you guys to
[29:32.920 --> 29:36.400]  take a dab with me. Whatever you're dabbing, get a big fat dab. I'm going to do like a
[29:36.400 --> 29:43.240]  point three here. Don't kill yourselves. I can't get it out. There we go. I'm going
[29:43.240 --> 29:47.560]  to go a little bigger, little bigger. One more piece. Ooh, now it's troublesome. There's
[29:47.560 --> 29:51.280]  always that limit with the dab. It's like, go a little bigger, go a little bigger. Oh
[29:51.280 --> 29:56.880]  shit. That's too big. So I'm going to grab the email. Shout out to giddy up and emo tech
[29:56.880 --> 30:00.760]  shout out to hit man. Dougie. We're going to do a dab off the hit man. E-series side
[30:00.760 --> 30:07.520]  car with the highly educated titanium nail hooked up to the emo tech G nail from giddy
[30:07.520 --> 30:12.000]  up. Shout out to all of those people for making my dabs. Amazing. Take a dab with me. You
[30:12.000 --> 30:34.430]  guys, here we go. Five, four, three. Oh yeah. I'm carb capping and freestyle rapping. Ooh,
[30:34.430 --> 30:38.190]  point three and no cough. Cause I'm a boss. What else do I have in here? I got some platinum
[30:38.190 --> 30:43.230]  OG. I've got some Tora Bora. Yeah. Shout out to the dabs. I like dabs a lot. I hope you
[30:43.230 --> 30:48.230]  do too. Uh, the next episode you guys is going to be, you know, the next episode will
[30:48.230 --> 30:52.910]  probably just be rambles and news because I'm still writing that perpetual grow episode.
[30:52.910 --> 30:57.190]  Uh, it's boggling my mind. I'm stuck, but I'm going to get it. I actually had a couple
[30:57.190 --> 30:59.870]  of people throw some ideas at me and I figured out how to do it. So we're going to get that
[30:59.870 --> 31:05.030]  together. I will be back in a few days. Thanks a lot for listening to you guys. Don't forget
[31:05.030 --> 31:08.910]  to check out the sponsors, the Rocky mountain worm company. If you're interested in sponsoring
[31:08.910 --> 31:12.630]  the podcast or if you've got a product you'd like me to review, send me an email. It's
[31:12.630 --> 31:17.350]  grow from your heart at hotmail.com. I'll get you all the information that you need.
[31:17.350 --> 31:21.310]  There's the cough from a 0.3. Now that the show's over, please go to the iTunes store
[31:21.310 --> 31:25.710]  or stitcher, uh, figure out how to leave a comment. All you got to do is go search for
[31:25.710 --> 31:29.750]  a girl from your heart. Uh, find the review section. Give me a five star rating. After

[31:33.090 --> 31:38.350]  on a future episode. Stitcher does keep changing the way that the comments are handled, but
[31:38.350 --> 31:41.590]  I usually find them and I will read them on the show. If you have something to say and
[31:41.590 --> 31:44.190]  you're not into the social media thing, you can email me. That's grow from your heart
[31:44.190 --> 31:49.910]  at hotmail.com. Don't forget that every episode is available on iTunes, stitcher and I read
[31:49.910 --> 31:53.470]  genetics colorado.com. I said that wrong. Not every episode. Most of the episodes are
[31:53.470 --> 31:58.270]  on iTunes and stitcher. Every single episode will always in forever be archived on I read
[31:58.270 --> 32:04.710]  genetics colorado.com. That's my website. They can't take that down. Uh, that is mine.
[32:04.710 --> 32:08.830]  Those episodes will be there forever. Uh, one through 70 will be there right now if
[32:08.830 --> 32:13.230]  you go and look. So I did add a donation button to the podcast page on the website.

[32:16.350 --> 32:20.690]  genetics colorado.com. Click on the grow from your heart podcast tab at the top, right?

[32:41.270 --> 32:46.470]  blew the fuck up. It was scary. It's expensive. It's stressful. We'll get it figured out.
