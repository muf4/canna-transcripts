[00:00.760 --> 00:28.760]  Welcome back podcast world. I'm your host my friends call me Rasta Jeff and this is episode 608 of the grow from your heart podcast. In this episode I'm going to read some Patreon messages and emails. Before we get there let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 club. Of course the 710 club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month level or higher. So with no further ado let's start off with the big grow from your heart podcast thank you shout out to the painted lady.
[00:28.760 --> 00:58.760]  Let's send a big thank you to canna organic. Let's say thank you to grant M and blackbird 76. Let's send a big grow from your heart podcast thank you shout out to grow man Stan and Mr. Mean Green. Let's send a big thank you to Robert and the BAFTA.

If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. All of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen and of course I did include a link in the show notes or the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends. Of course please don't pull out your phone and try to visit Patreon if you're at work don't get yourself in trouble. If you're driving don't get yourself in a wreck. Be safe that link will be there for later. Thank you so much for watching. I'll see you next time. Bye.
[01:28.760 --> 01:57.760]  Later. All right. Thanks again for the Patreon support. I do appreciate that. I do have some feedback from the last episode and the last episode I got a question about labeling a new cross. There were a lot of responses to the terms and labels I decided to use in that episode. I will address those here in a future episode. I did not use the terms P1 for parents. It turns out I did maybe technically use the wrong label for the indication that I chose on the new strain.
[01:57.760 --> 02:27.760]  However we're going to talk about that very much in depth in a future episode. I need to put that together a little bit better. We're going to focus on this episode. Just wanted to say I do know there was some controversy. There was some great feedback which I asked for and we're going to talk about that in depth in the future. Also I do need to make an update. In the last episode I mentioned that we should check out our friend reclining with Riven and check out his podcast. A lot of people messaged me and said hey bro Riven has changed the name. There is a new name to Riven's podcast. It is now called May's
[02:27.760 --> 02:57.760]  while medicated. He sent me a message and said yo Rasta Jeff thank you for the shout out. I've actually changed the name of my channel from reclining with Riven to made while medicated. He sent me a link to the new channel. You guys please do subscribe to my buddy. What's it called made while medicated. Check out that channel. Educate yourself. More stuff to check out. We're all hanging out during quarantine. We need something to do. Go check out some of my friends YouTube channels. That is all the updates and chatter at the start of the show. Let's jump into the email portion.
[02:57.760 --> 03:27.760]  Of this podcast. The first question came from the grow help tab on the I read genetics Web site. That's right. If you check out my Web site I read genetics dot com. There is a grow help tab. If you click on there you are asked a few preliminary questions. We ask what strain you're growing where you're growing at what kind of lights. Just a few basic questions to give me an idea of what's going on in your garden. If I'm going to answer your questions it's very helpful to have some details. So the first question comes from the grow help tab and it goes just like this. It's from our friend. They want to start
[03:27.760 --> 03:57.760]  to call them a dub or squirrel master. I'm going to go with squirrel master. I do not have any friends named squirrel master. I do now shout out to my new friend squirrel master squirrel master is growing purple panty dropper. I did not know that was a strain name. That is a great name of a strain panty dropper is a good name. It is being grown indoors. It's under LED lights. They are in veg. They're in week three. They're growing with deep water culture. They use the Remo full line plus since he's I am Hydra guard and armor side. That is a very in-depth mix the pH of the
[03:57.760 --> 04:27.760]  last feeding was 6.0. I may bring that up just a couple of dots but not too extreme. The PPM or EC of the last feeding was 1000 the plants like that. That's acceptable. We'll see how that goes. Daytime temp says usually nighttime temp says usually hovers around 80 give or take a degree relative humidity in the day is 55. We don't have a nighttime humidity indicated here. It says the problem first off. I love the show. I just wish there was more info on recirculating deep water culture.
[04:27.760 --> 04:57.760]  Me too, but unfortunately, I am not experienced in deep water recirculating deep water culture. I don't know enough about that to deliver a podcast. I would be lying. I'd be making shit up. I try to deliver content that I actually know what I'm talking about. Maybe I contradicted that in the past episode because I said some stuff that was slightly off. However, I try to come prepared and talk about things that I know I'm talking about recirculating deep water culture is not my specialty my area of expertise. I would need to find a friend who is into recirculating deep water culture that wants to be on a podcast either
[04:57.760 --> 05:09.160]  across the table or via zoom and get them on the show and have them teach us teach me teach you at the same time about the R D W C recirculating deep water culture.
[05:09.160 --> 05:18.560]  That's what I'm saying. So I need a friend who knows about that. If you are an expert or consider yourself an expert and you're comfortable being on a zoom meeting and you want to teach us about recirculating deep water culture.
[05:18.560 --> 05:32.960]  Love to hear from you. You know my email address. It is grow from your heart at hotmail.com. Anyway, there is more to this question that we can address. It says I do like to run a 15 hour cycle for a week before I switch to 1212.
[05:32.960 --> 05:44.560]  So in most cases we run our lights on either 18 six or something near that. Some people run a 24 on and zero off cycle for the vegetative stage. We want a lot of light for the veg stage keeps them in veg.
[05:45.560 --> 05:57.560]  Then we will switch to a 1212 cycle to induce the flowering phase. Our friend squirrel master here likes to run a 15 hour on cycle for one week before they switch to 1212.
[05:58.560 --> 06:12.560]  I'm not sure why a lot of people do like to make a gradual switch from the veg to the flowering stage. I'm not sure why people do that. We'll talk more about that in a moment. But it says my question is do I continue using my veg feed chart during the 15 hour days?
[06:12.560 --> 06:26.560]  Or do I switch to my flower feed chart or do a combination of both? I use Remo's feed charts. Thanks in advance. Much love. I can't wait until this run is done so I can grow these orange chasm seeds which have been calling my name.
[06:26.560 --> 06:35.560]  I love it that you've got some orange chasm on deck. I love that you've got a nice practice run going on before you get to them. We'll have you growing like a pro before you run those orange chasms.
[06:36.560 --> 06:49.560]  It's always a good idea to stick with that nutrient calculator. You said that you were growing with Remo's nutrients and you are using Remo's nutrient feed chart. That's a good idea. They made the product. They know what's in there. They know what's in each bottle. They know what your goal is.
[06:49.560 --> 07:05.560]  You may not need to use 100% of what they recommend. If they say 100% maybe you can use 75%. If they say 10% maybe use 7%. Because of course they do want you to buy more. So they're going to push you to the very limit. But they're not going to burn you on purpose. So you may be able to reduce just a little bit.
[07:05.560 --> 07:28.560]  Now let's get to the main part of this question. They want to know if they should use the veg or the bloom nutrients during these weird 15 hour days. You know why there's no 15 hour day chart in Remo's nutrient schedule is because most growers probably would not recommend this. I'm going to shit all over your idea of 15 hour days. I apologize. But then we're going to talk about the nutrients.
[07:29.560 --> 07:54.560]  I wouldn't do this. By going for a 15 hour day you are either, you're not flowering. So you're not inducing the flowering stage. You're not getting enough dark time to go into flower. And you're also losing 2 maybe 3 maybe 4 hours of daytime photons that your plants could be getting to photosynthesize, grow stronger, grow bigger. I think you're kind of ripping yourself off by going for that 15 hour day.
[07:55.560 --> 08:18.560]  Either go veg or go flower. Don't go right in the middle. I don't think it would be beneficial. We don't get as much benefit from excessive dark as we do excessive light when we're in veg. So I would just go for a longer veg time during the day. I hate to crap all over your idea. If it's working for you man, do your thing. But as a very experienced grower with a lot of knowledge and experience about this plant, I feel like you're kind of ripping yourself off.
[08:19.560 --> 08:39.560]  And that's why there's no written nutrient schedule for this idea because we just don't want it. Most of us don't want to do this. Most of us wouldn't do this. We would stick with an 18-6 veg, a 20 on and 4 off veg, a 24 hour veg, something like that. Then go straight to the 12-12. I think you're kind of ripping yourself off by doing the 15 hour days.
[08:40.560 --> 08:56.560]  But you're technically still in veg and I would feed them veg because you don't want them to run out of vegetative nutrients. So give them that extra week of veg nudes. It's probably two feeds anyway, that full week. It's probably maybe two, maybe three feedings anyway. So I would stick with the veg nudes in that time.
[08:56.560 --> 09:16.560]  But unless you've got a really good convincing testimony as to why you think these plants benefit with a 15 hour day, I would skip that. I would stick with my 18 hours on, my 20 hours on or 24 even. I wouldn't do the 15 hour days because you're wasting opportunity for photons.
[09:16.560 --> 09:38.560]  You could be putting more light hours into these plants. The light hours are what make them grow, photosynthesize, metabolize. So I do feel like you are possibly ripping yourself off. You could get bigger plants faster. They'd be healthier. That's my opinion. I don't know if that is accurate. But unless you've got a really good explanation, good testimony, I would skip that part. I feel like you're ripping yourself off.
[09:38.560 --> 09:54.560]  All right, Squirrel Master, I feel like I have addressed your question. I would stick with the vegetative nudes if you do insist on doing this method. However, I would reassess your reasoning behind this method. I'm not trying to bash you. I'm not trying to doubt you. I'm just saying in my opinion, that is not what I would do.
[09:54.560 --> 10:22.560]  All right, we're going to keep moving forward. I do have more messages here in front of me. Let's see. Did I go in the right order? Yes. This one comes from our Australian friends. Do they want their name said on the show? We're just going to call this person Ben. This one came from our friend Ben in Australia. And this one goes a lot like this. It says, what's up Rasta Jeff? Greetings from down under. Shout out to my Australian friends. I hope you guys are doing well down there. Shout out to all the Aussies. I'm trying to turn upside down here on the screen. I can't go far enough.
[10:22.560 --> 10:48.560]  Wouldn't it be cool if I could just make my dreads hang the other way for a moment and be upside down? That would be awesome. I'm rambling and high today. I hope you are too. The message goes like this. It says, I am loving the Grow From Your Heart podcast here in beautiful Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. Shout out down there. It says, thank you for all of your grow advice and for trying to keep things simple for all levels of growing ability. Yes, that is my goal. I want to explain things to where the brand new growers can learn it.
[10:48.560 --> 11:16.560]  But also I want to keep it interesting so the experienced growers can still follow along and not get bored. So thank you for noticing, complimenting and appreciating my teaching skills. There is a small fungus gnat or something buzzing around me. Sorry if you see me swatting at that on camera. I've said it before. I am not crazy. We're going to keep going here. It does say I am an outdoor grower of two years and I am blessed with beautiful growing conditions for much of the year round. That is up for debate. I've read this message. That environment is up for debate.
[11:16.560 --> 11:44.560]  It says, I have a question about flowering, which I hope you can help with. I've got an answer for you. It says, in Australia, for growing outside, there's always been a general rule, Father's Day to Mother's Day. I hear that translates from early September to early April. So you've got basically the opposite growing cycle of us here in the States. It says this has always been a reliable time frame when growing our Australian regular bag seed, which we commonly call bush. All right.
[11:44.560 --> 11:58.560]  So you're growing your commonly found bag seed that you call bush weed there in Australia. You've got yourself a pretty figured out schedule. It sounds like September, October, November, December, January, March, April. That's enough time to grow a good crop. Sounds like you got that figured out.
[11:58.560 --> 12:26.560]  Here's where we run into the problems or the questions. It says with the advent of commercially sold seeds and feminized seeds, it seemed that we cannot depend on this timeline anymore as these types of seeds seem more sensitive to our environmental cues. And they do have a tendency to bolt into flower any time for any number of reasons. The Indica's are especially quick to flower. In fact, it seems the only way I can get my plants through a whole season is to plant them.
[12:26.560 --> 12:54.560]  Manually pop up a light, a top up the light period in early weeks. Now that gives me some hints of what could be going on right there. The fact that they go into flower quickly, the Indica's do it and you can help it by putting up some light. That gives me ideas already on how to diagnose your problem. It says this has a lot of local growers scratching their Aussie heads for sure. So my question here is, have you heard of or experienced something like this before? Am I right in thinking these seeds are more sensitive to our environmental cues?
[12:54.560 --> 13:22.560]  Am I right in thinking these seeds are more sensitive due to their breeding and feminizing? Quickly, disclaimer, it has nothing to do with the feminizing. This has zero to do with feminized seeds. It does have to do with the breeding. It does have to do with the genetics and the critical photo period of these plants. It has zero to do with feminizing. I don't want to pin any of this. Fem seeds get a bad enough rap. Fem seeds have enough fingers pointed at them. We cannot point the finger at fem seeds for this issue.
[13:22.560 --> 13:50.560]  I just want to pull them out and not throw them under that bus. It's pulled them out from under that bus and keep them up on a pedestal. So it says, is there anything you can suggest that we could do or we could do or we could avoid doing to help our plants stay in veg and reach their full potential? He signs off with I always appreciate your time and effort and helping the community. If I if you ever do come down under to Australia, don't hesitate to hit me up as there will be a nice fat big joint and a cold drink at the ready.
[13:50.560 --> 14:16.560]  Take care of Rasta Jeff from your new Aussie friend, Ben. Hey Ben, thank you for the invite down there to Australia. I would love to come visit you. I hear that everything out there is trying to kill you in Australia. Now that sound like I got a friend Ben who's going to keep me safe. Go hang out down there and see what's going on. So let's focus in here and talk about why these plants are going into flower. I did reply to Ben so that he didn't have to wait a long time for me to get this on the show.
[14:16.560 --> 14:44.560]  Let me read what I replied to Ben. It says, yo Ben, thank you for listening to the show. This is a great subject. It says all strains have a critical period that will trigger flowering. Most of the plants we are working with now have been bred to flower with 12 hours of uninterrupted darkness because most of the strains we have bred. It works for our indoor grow environment. What we have selected. They do have a critical period of 12 hours of under uninterrupted darkness will make them flower.
[14:44.560 --> 15:13.560]  I said it sounds like your environment is giving less than 12 hours of light. Your Aussie bred seeds are likely bred from plants that know the environment there so they don't bloom as eagerly. So I hope this makes sense. So since those seeds are from that environment, they know what light cycle to expect. The parent plants for many, many generations have known that these that the environment is going to be short days and short nights or long nights very quickly into the flowering season.
[15:13.560 --> 15:41.560]  So these plants have been acclimated. They've been bred to that. It is. Is this a what's the word I'm looking for? It will come to me. I'm just going to keep talking. Is this a what's the word when the genes remember? I know the word. It's on the tip of my tongue. I almost said it a minute ago. That word will come to me, but it is in the gene memory. This is part of the evolution of the plant. The plant has been in that environment for so long that it just knows it's like, hey, I know that we're only going to get short days and I can't start flowering too early or I'm not going to get big enough.
[15:42.560 --> 16:01.560]  So he did take the time to reply back and he said, thanks very much for taking the time to help out me. It is great advice. I think you may have hit the head on the nail with the light at planting time. We get just over 12 hours of daylight time. So when they're planning their plants at the beginning of the season, they are only getting 12 hours of daylight.
[16:01.560 --> 16:29.560]  That will trigger most newly bred seeds to go into flower. They've got some plants that are from their environment that know that that's what they're going to get. They don't go into flower as their days get a little bit shorter. They need that a little bit longer flowering time and that will put their plants into flower. So it says each day only extends by less than a minute. So by the time they are mature enough, it's still only 12 and a half hours of it says only 12.5, but it's only 12 and a half hours of darkness.
[16:29.560 --> 16:58.560]  Now I says in future grows, I will plant later as well as add manual lighting at the end of the day for a couple of weeks. That will solve the problem. If you're growing the seeds that come from the States or Dutch seeds or maybe Spanish seeds anywhere else, those seeds have not been acclimated, acclimatized. There's another word I'm trying to think of. It's like my medics. It's, it's in my head. You guys all have to just post the word. Somebody is going to type it in the chat right now. People are yelling it at their phones. It is gene memory. I don't know the word I'm trying to think of right now.
[16:59.560 --> 17:28.560]  Anyway, your seeds will, if they're from the Aussie environment, they're already programmed, I guess, to not flower that early, but the seeds that are coming from American breeders, Dutch breeders, they're going to keep doing that, but putting up a light to keep them in veg, to give them more light, longer daytime that will solve that problem. It says it's all learning. The podcast really helps to refine this. Keep up the excellent work. It has been invaluable knowledge and I for one really appreciate it. Cheers from your friend Ben.
[17:28.560 --> 17:57.560]  Hey Ben, thank you for the great message. Thank you for the great question and thank you for letting me solve your problem and thank you for the great feedback. All right, I'm going to wonder what the word I was thinking was all day. I'm going to have to Google that at the end of this. Jeez. All right, where are we? We're about 20 minutes into this. We've got plenty of time for another message here. This one also came from the grow help tab on the website. Of course, I read genetics.com. Click on the grow help tab. This one came from our friend who also supports us on Patreon. This, this one came from black hippie.
[17:57.560 --> 18:26.560]  Black hippie is growing the strain GMO. They're growing indoor under LED lighting. They are in veg. They're growing in soil. They're feeding. The last feed was pH tap water. The pH of the feeding was six five. I may go one or two points lower on that, but you can't be too critical. Sometimes the EC of the last feeding was 200. The day and night temps were in Celsius 25 and 23. I'm going to assume that's acceptable. I did not research Celsius conversions. Anyway, let's jump into the problem.
[18:26.560 --> 18:54.560]  It says the Rasta Jeff, the problem. First off, big fist bump, bro. I love the show and I never miss an episode. I am also a proud Patreon. Thank you for the Patreon support. It says I'm on discord and the Iri and I'm also an IgIri army member, bro. Thank you for all the support all around. They follow us on Patreon. They follow us on discord and on the Instagram. So they watch me on Instagram on Monday on the live show. Thank you, bro. That is a lot of Rasta Jeff support there.
[18:54.560 --> 19:22.560]  It says I love learning from you and working on bringing excellence to the green thumb craft. And then it says there's a part here I'm going to skip. Anyway, big respect and Rasta far right to the part that I skipped. It says anyway, I'm planning on purchasing some orange gasm seeds soon. So I decided to start practicing taking clones from a beautifully structured GMO plant that I got the seeds from a friend that GMO plant grows beautifully, doesn't it? I love that plant.
[19:22.560 --> 19:50.560]  It goes on to say I took eight clones. I clipped the leaves. I cut an at an angle. I then dip them into clone X and stuck them into pre soaked root riot cubes. I placed them all inside a misted propagation dome and sat them on the heating mat inside a closet under 24 hours of light. After seeing plenty of root growth, I transplanted them into small plastic garden pots using happy frog soil. Do those pots have drainage holes on the bottom is my first question.
[19:50.560 --> 20:16.560]  You said that's garden pots. I'm going to assume so, but I hope so. It says I then water lightly and placed back under the light. But here's where shit starts to go wrong. It says, but my family started to look crispy and they are dying, but the stocks weren't actually withering. I thought my light might have been the issue because I've heard that clones don't need direct light. So I put them under a small LED for vegging.
[20:16.560 --> 20:39.560]  Uh, that could be your issue. If the light was too much, it may have crisped them up, but I think we've got bigger issues here. Uh, you're probably better off under that led. Keep that led up kind of high. Don't get it too close. We just want to give them enough light to adjust to their new environment. So, uh, I don't want to just throw these away as an experiment, but I don't know what else to do. I even fed them some microbes and cow mag.
[20:39.560 --> 21:07.560]  Probably not a good idea for these little tiny plants. That's probably too much. Microbes is probably a great idea, but don't give them cow mag next time. It's probably freaking them out. Uh, this is see if I get any improvements, not much as of yet. And I don't know if they're still focusing on even building a root system, but I'm not seeing any new growth, but I want to get this down right before I get some orange chasm so that I don't lose those genetics. That's a good idea. It says, uh, again, thank you for all the love and knowledge. I'm about to take a fat dad.
[21:09.560 --> 21:38.560]  I'll give my mom a hug tomorrow. Big shout out to mama. Hope she got her hug. Hope mama's doing well here during COVID. Then it says, PS, I tried uploading a picture. Uh, yeah, it's difficult uploading a picture here on the new grow help tab. I apologize for that. We work. We'll work on that. Shout out to the web guy. If you're watching this, um, maybe bill me for that one. Then it goes on. It says I will post on cannabis though. Don't forget to follow us all on cannabis. It says you could check that out. If you'd like, I am at black hippie four 20 on cannabis. All right. Do I do have some feedback for you?
[21:39.560 --> 22:09.560]  Here. Uh, my first question is when you took these clones, it sounds like you took them correctly. You cut them at an angle, stuck them in the, uh, clone X juice. You got them in the rapid router or the root riot cubes. You waited till you had some roots. Then you transplanted them. My question is, did you slowly acclimate these plants to the new environment? Uh, they were in a dome for a little while. Did you open up the domes and then take off the dome for a little bit every day? Or did you just take these plants out of the clone dome and pop them right into cups and throw them under growth?
[22:09.560 --> 22:39.560]  Lights and hope they would survive. They've been growing in that dome and kind of a protected environment for however long it took them to get roots. So what needed to be done? I don't know if you did this. I'm just giving this advice for anybody who was trying to transfer their clones from their clone dome to the regular environment. When you take clones, you can't just pull them out of that clone dome. They're in there. It's humid. They love that environment. They're used to it. We need to slowly acclimate them to the outer environment. Unless you're, uh, unless you've got a room with the same
[22:39.560 --> 22:43.360]  exact environment is inside that clone dome. You've got to slowly adjust them.
[22:43.360 --> 22:47.840]  So the way I recommend to do it is about a week after you've cut them. Uh,
[22:47.860 --> 22:49.880]  you're going to want to, before you get to this point,
[22:49.880 --> 22:52.160]  you're going to want to open them up and remoist in those plugs,
[22:52.440 --> 22:56.400]  then close them back up. Then about day seven, start opening the vents.
[22:56.400 --> 22:58.800]  My clone domes have two vents. Some only have one,
[22:58.960 --> 23:02.440]  start opening the vents just a little bit. Uh, maybe 10,
[23:02.440 --> 23:05.600]  maybe 20% of the event it'd be, we'll be open on day one.
[23:05.920 --> 23:07.520]  Let that kick it for a couple of days.
[23:07.520 --> 23:10.040]  Let those plants get used to having a little bit of airflow,
[23:10.240 --> 23:13.400]  then move it just a little bit more. Let it go for a couple of days,
[23:13.400 --> 23:15.240]  then move it just a little bit more.
[23:15.480 --> 23:18.640]  After those plants are starting to develop a few roots.
[23:18.640 --> 23:22.720]  That's when I start taking the dome off. I'll take it off for about 15 minutes.
[23:22.760 --> 23:25.280]  Let it sit for 15 minutes and put it back on.
[23:25.560 --> 23:29.680]  Then tomorrow take it off for 15 more minutes. Do that for about three days.
[23:29.960 --> 23:33.000]  Then step up to 30 minutes. Do that for about three days.
[23:33.000 --> 23:37.600]  Then step up to 45, maybe an hour. Do that for three, maybe five days.
[23:37.600 --> 23:42.600]  Then go two hours. Then go four hours. Once those plants can go for maybe six,
[23:42.600 --> 23:44.120]  maybe eight hours, uh,
[23:44.160 --> 23:47.160]  out of that dome without showing any signs of being angry.
[23:47.360 --> 23:50.720]  That's when I will transplant them into their cups or their small pots,
[23:50.920 --> 23:53.640]  but you've got to give them a small adjustment period.
[23:53.640 --> 23:57.400]  You can't just throw them from that dome directly into that new environment.
[23:57.400 --> 23:59.720]  That's when they will see issues very quickly.
[23:59.720 --> 24:03.520]  So that is the first thing I would recommend. Slowly acclimate these plants.
[24:03.800 --> 24:07.680]  Don't go straight from the clone dome, uh, right on down into that environment.
[24:07.680 --> 24:11.640]  You don't want to go from, uh, the shower to outside in the snow. Uh,
[24:11.640 --> 24:13.200]  that's going to be a shitty transition.
[24:13.320 --> 24:17.280]  You got to go from the shower to the hot bathroom to the warmer living room.
[24:17.280 --> 24:19.880]  Then you step outside once you're dressed and you can face the cold.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.720]  You got to do the same thing to the plants. All right. Uh,
[24:22.720 --> 24:25.920]  you said they started shriveling. Excuse me. My voice is getting dry.
[24:25.920 --> 24:29.280]  You said they started shriveling. Uh, they're starting to lose moisture.
[24:29.280 --> 24:30.320]  They're starting to dry up.
[24:30.320 --> 24:34.280]  They're starting to possibly die between the outside environment and that light
[24:34.280 --> 24:38.120]  on them. They are cooking a little bit. You may have taken them out too quickly.
[24:38.800 --> 24:42.200]  Um, maybe wait until you've got more roots next time. I like to wait.
[24:42.440 --> 24:43.360]  If you're a new grower,
[24:43.360 --> 24:46.360]  I'd like to see you wait until you've got ridiculous excessive roots.
[24:46.360 --> 24:50.040]  A lot of time we get very impatient and we want to just pot right away.
[24:50.280 --> 24:54.080]  So wait until you've got a lot of roots and then be very careful transplanting.
[24:54.400 --> 24:57.200]  You very well could have crushed the roots. You may have that, uh,
[24:57.200 --> 25:00.560]  your new soil could be packed too loosely, could be packed too densely.
[25:00.560 --> 25:04.400]  There could be a few things causing this, but it sounds to me, honestly,
[25:04.400 --> 25:09.040]  like you went too quickly from being in that domed environment into the non
[25:09.040 --> 25:12.920]  domed environment is what it sounds like. So I would practice again. Uh,
[25:12.920 --> 25:16.040]  cloning materials are not the most expensive. This could be, uh,
[25:16.040 --> 25:18.240]  the not the most expensive mistake you could have made.
[25:18.240 --> 25:20.360]  And everybody needs practice learning how to clone.
[25:20.600 --> 25:23.920]  So just cut those clones the same way you did before you did everything fine,
[25:23.920 --> 25:26.400]  right up to the transplant point. It sounds like also,
[25:26.400 --> 25:29.160]  don't give those clones the CalMag. They don't need that yet.
[25:29.200 --> 25:30.720]  You can wait till they're a little bit bigger.
[25:31.080 --> 25:35.760]  Also maybe bring the pH of your feeding down closer to six,
[25:35.760 --> 25:39.440]  a three, six, four, a six, five, maybe just a bit high for the clones.
[25:39.440 --> 25:40.280]  But honestly,
[25:40.320 --> 25:43.800]  I do think that what you probably did was introduce them to that outer
[25:43.800 --> 25:46.040]  environment just a little bit too quickly,
[25:46.040 --> 25:47.880]  slow that down a little bit next time.
[25:48.120 --> 25:50.280]  And I bet they will be a little bit happier with you.
[25:50.280 --> 25:53.360]  Let me know how that works for you. Let me know if you've got any more questions.
[25:53.560 --> 25:56.840]  I would love to see if we can help you out and guide you through getting your
[25:56.840 --> 26:00.360]  clone game on point. All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
