[01:58.860 --> 02:01.860]  I do apologize if you hear me struggling to catch my breath.
[02:01.860 --> 02:03.860]  I've been taking a couple of fat dabs before the show here.
[02:03.860 --> 02:08.860]  I just smoked a nice buffet, a smorgasbord if you will, of great concentrates.
[02:08.860 --> 02:12.860]  Amongst those dabs was a mix, a combo of the Lemon Jeffrey and the Machine.
[02:12.860 --> 02:16.860]  That dab made my vision go weird, it made my head feel funny in all the right ways.
[02:16.860 --> 02:18.860]  So I'm over here struggling trying to catch my breath.
[02:18.860 --> 02:21.860]  I feel like I'm underwater. I feel like I've got someone sitting on my chest.
[02:21.860 --> 02:23.860]  It's a little bit heavy to breathe over here.
[02:23.860 --> 02:27.860]  I will get my shit together eventually. We will make a podcast out of this.
[02:27.860 --> 02:31.860]  Thank you for dealing with my wheezy voice trying to catch my breath here.
[02:31.860 --> 02:35.860]  Alright, I've got one more thing to cover before we get to the main topic of this podcast.
[02:35.860 --> 02:41.860]  I do invite you to join Team Irie Genetics and the Dude Grows crew and the Irie Army
[02:41.860 --> 02:48.860]  and many other great cannabis breeders for the DGC Growers Cup in Fort Collins on July 30th.
[02:48.860 --> 02:53.860]  That's right, Team Irie Genetics and many other breeders, many members of the cannabis community,
[02:53.860 --> 02:57.860]  many members of the Dude Grows Cup, the Dude Grows crew, and the Irie Army
[02:57.860 --> 03:01.860]  will be hanging out at the DGC Growers Cup in Fort Collins.
[03:01.860 --> 03:03.860]  I do invite you to come hang out with us.
[03:03.860 --> 03:07.860]  I look forward to smoking a joint with you, taking a dab with you, giving you a hug,
[03:07.860 --> 03:11.860]  giving you a fist bump, taking a selfie with you, getting to know you, meeting you face to face
[03:11.860 --> 03:15.860]  if we've never met before, and seeing your smiling face again if we've hung out before.
[03:15.860 --> 03:19.860]  I do look forward to seeing you at the Dude Grows Cup, so do please come hang out.
[03:19.860 --> 03:25.860]  You can find all of the info you need at DudeGrows.com. I cannot wait to see you there.
[03:25.860 --> 03:29.860]  Alright, I have been teasing these emails saying I've got an email portion of this podcast.
[03:29.860 --> 03:32.860]  We have not done any of that. Let's jump into it.
[03:32.860 --> 03:38.860]  This question is not 100% cannabis related, but I feel like I am qualified to answer this question.
[03:38.860 --> 03:43.860]  I feel like my friend Orville felt that I was qualified because Orville asked me this question.
[03:43.860 --> 03:46.860]  Big shout out to my buddy Orville. The question says, really simply,
[03:46.860 --> 03:50.860]  how do you start a podcast? I would like to know. That's a great question.
[03:50.860 --> 03:55.860]  Since I'm 754 podcasts in, I've got quite a nice follow ship here, a listenership,
[03:55.860 --> 03:59.860]  a viewership if you will. We've got a good audience. We've built a good community out of this.
[03:59.860 --> 04:05.860]  I get a lot of good interaction here, so I do feel like I may be qualified to talk about starting a podcast.
[04:05.860 --> 04:13.860]  Starting a podcast can be very difficult or it could be very easy. It depends on how you want to make it.
[04:13.860 --> 04:19.860]  The one thing that I hear people say about their podcast is they're going to start it when,
[04:19.860 --> 04:24.860]  or once I get this ready, I'm going to start it. My advice is just start it.
[04:24.860 --> 04:28.860]  It is never going to be the perfect time. The podcast is never going to be perfect.
[04:28.860 --> 04:31.860]  You're never going to have the perfect time to start a podcast.
[04:31.860 --> 04:36.860]  The perfect time to start a podcast is right now because if you put, in my opinion,
[04:36.860 --> 04:41.860]  if you put too much production into it, too much thought into it, make it too big of a production,
[04:41.860 --> 04:45.860]  it puts too much pressure on you and it won't, it'll never meet your standards.
[04:45.860 --> 04:50.860]  This podcast, I've done 750 something episodes. None of them have been perfect,
[04:50.860 --> 04:55.860]  but they've all come out. They've all served their purpose. They're all viewable, listenable, enjoyable.
[04:55.860 --> 04:58.860]  They all get a lot of good reaction. It's never going to be the perfect time.
[04:58.860 --> 05:02.860]  The perfect time is now since it's not perfect, you'll capture the moment.
[05:02.860 --> 05:06.860]  Whatever the podcast is about, there needs to be a moment that is captured.
[05:06.860 --> 05:10.860]  You guys know kind of what's going on in my life. You know what's going on in my greenhouse.
[05:10.860 --> 05:11.860]  You know what's happening in my grow. You know,
[05:11.860 --> 05:17.860]  small details about my life because I share them here on the podcast and you can capture the moment here with me.
[05:17.860 --> 05:21.860]  That is what's important. So don't make it too perfect. I've done 754 episodes.
[05:21.860 --> 05:25.860]  I don't feel any of them were perfect, but all of them were perfect.
[05:25.860 --> 05:29.860]  So don't wait for the perfect episode. Don't wait for the perfect time. Capture the moment.
[05:29.860 --> 05:32.860]  And I talked about making, making it hard or making it easy.
[05:32.860 --> 05:36.860]  One of the first things about a podcast, I guess, is you need an idea.
[05:36.860 --> 05:39.860]  What is the show about? You've got to talk about something.
[05:39.860 --> 05:41.860]  It's got to be something you're at least passionate about,
[05:41.860 --> 05:46.860]  something you're educated about or curious about or something that people will want to hear you talk about.
[05:46.860 --> 05:51.860]  What are, what is your topic? If you're asking this question, you've probably already got an idea.
[05:51.860 --> 05:55.860]  Go with it. If you are thinking about it, that means that there needs to be that podcast.
[05:55.860 --> 05:58.860]  If you want to start it, there are probably people out there that want to listen to it.
[05:58.860 --> 06:02.860]  So have an idea. Then you'll need equipment.
[06:02.860 --> 06:07.860]  It doesn't take a lot to get your idea from your brain to your mouth, into a microphone and onto the Internet.
[06:07.860 --> 06:12.860]  It just takes a microphone, some sort of a USB recording device,
[06:13.860 --> 06:18.860]  and possibly some editing software and a computer. But some of that isn't even necessary.
[06:18.860 --> 06:20.860]  You could, you could record directly into your iPhone.
[06:20.860 --> 06:24.860]  You could open up a voice app into your iPhone and talk into that and say what you have to say
[06:24.860 --> 06:30.860]  and then send that file directly to a website and have it posted to the Internet as a podcast.
[06:30.860 --> 06:34.860]  You could take a moment and edit that file if you wanted, or you could just send it up raw.
[06:34.860 --> 06:38.860]  That's called live to drive. If you just talk and then don't even edit, don't do anything to shine it up,
[06:38.860 --> 06:41.860]  send it right out to the world. That is live to drive. That is possible.
[06:41.860 --> 06:46.860]  If you want to be more critical, this show is well edited. I use a camera. I use a microphone.
[06:46.860 --> 06:51.860]  I record simultaneously. I match the files together using Final Cut Pro.
[06:51.860 --> 06:54.860]  Then I edit them. I put stuff in it. I make it look fancy.
[06:54.860 --> 06:58.860]  It can be as difficult or as simple as you want it to be. You need a microphone.
[06:58.860 --> 07:02.860]  The better the microphone, obviously, the better the quality of the sound.
[07:02.860 --> 07:08.860]  I am using a Shure SM7B. This is one of the top microphones available for broadcasting, for podcasting.
[07:08.860 --> 07:12.860]  This is a really great mic. Also, it is not the cheapest mic on the planet.
[07:12.860 --> 07:18.860]  There are many more, much more affordable microphones available that will work for you as a podcaster.
[07:18.860 --> 07:22.860]  Like I said, you can use your iPhone. You can use a little handheld voice recorder.
[07:22.860 --> 07:28.860]  You can get a good microphone. Then if you get a SM7B, you need another piece just to power the mic.
[07:28.860 --> 07:32.860]  I've got a Cloudlifter over here that provides power for the microphone because it needs some sort of juice.
[07:33.860 --> 07:38.860]  You can get as technical as you want to get. This microphone does not plug into my computer directly.
[07:38.860 --> 07:42.860]  My computer is not here. I don't need the MacBook or any sort of Mac devices at this time.
[07:42.860 --> 07:50.860]  I'm running into a Zoom PodTrack P4. So I'm doing the SM7B into a Cloudlifter into the Zoom P4.
[07:50.860 --> 07:56.860]  I'm capturing the audio file on the P4. That is all you need if you want to do an audio podcast.
[07:56.860 --> 07:58.860]  That would be more than enough to do an audio podcast.
[07:59.860 --> 08:04.860]  When I'm done, I would, if I were just to do that, when I were done, I would take the file from the Zoom,
[08:04.860 --> 08:10.860]  dump it into a computer, and edit it from there, and then post it to the website, the RSS feed, however that works.
[08:10.860 --> 08:13.860]  That's a whole other topic. But what I'm doing, I'm doing another step.
[08:13.860 --> 08:17.860]  Don't let me confuse you. Don't let me overrun you. I'm just letting you know kind of what I do and giving you options.
[08:17.860 --> 08:23.860]  I go SM7B to the Cloudlifter to the Zoom device. I get the sound dialed in in the Zoom device.
[08:23.860 --> 08:27.860]  Then I use a headphone out. So I've got headphone one comes to me.
[08:27.860 --> 08:33.860]  Headphone two is the small jack going directly out into the input of the camera.
[08:33.860 --> 08:37.860]  So I've got a camera in front of me. I'm using the Sony a7 III is what I think that one's called.
[08:37.860 --> 08:41.860]  I can't see the label. I'm looking at the front face of the camera. I can't see it. Great camera.
[08:41.860 --> 08:46.860]  Camera one is awesome. Camera two can eat my ass. That thing only works half the time. Can't figure it out.
[08:46.860 --> 08:52.860]  But I'm running it, the headphone directly into the input, the mic input of the camera.
[08:52.860 --> 08:58.860]  So I'm getting straight from the Zoom device onto the same file. My file is synced up. My audio and video are synced.
[08:58.860 --> 09:03.860]  I don't, unless I make a mistake, I don't have to go into Final Cut Pro and sync them manually.
[09:03.860 --> 09:08.860]  Although I am recording here on the Zoom P4 audio format just as a backup plan.
[09:08.860 --> 09:13.860]  If this audio file on the camera does go wrong, I've at least got the audio recording.
[09:13.860 --> 09:18.860]  If the video fails, I don't do a second camera right now because camera two is really pissing me off to tell you the truth.
[09:18.860 --> 09:21.860]  And it made the file much larger to load to YouTube and it took too long.
[09:21.860 --> 09:27.860]  But I do have a backup of the audio. If the audio fails, I've got that. I'm recording it twice on two different formats.
[09:27.860 --> 09:34.860]  So I go microphone, Cloudlifter, USB device, then to the camera.
[09:34.860 --> 09:39.860]  You could do a microphone that links, excuse me.
[09:39.860 --> 09:45.860]  You could do a microphone that directly links via USB to your computer and save a couple of steps.
[09:45.860 --> 09:47.860]  But then you need the computer to record all the time.
[09:47.860 --> 09:51.860]  I catch myself being distracted by the graph on the computer and all the data that the computer gives me.
[09:51.860 --> 09:54.860]  I want to play with the computer. I end up staring into it.
[09:54.860 --> 09:57.860]  So I've kind of eliminated the computer from my recording mix.
[09:57.860 --> 10:02.860]  If I were only producing, if I were the producer paying attention to the show and sound levels,
[10:02.860 --> 10:08.860]  and there were multiple people with headphones and mics, I would have a computer in front of me so I could monitor the mix.
[10:08.860 --> 10:12.860]  And if somebody got too far from the mic, I could say, hey, bro, can you lean into that mic so we could hear you?
[10:12.860 --> 10:17.860]  But I'm producing, recording, I'm doing it all. I'm talking, I'm hosting, doing it all.
[10:17.860 --> 10:19.860]  So I can't have so many distractions.
[10:19.860 --> 10:22.860]  So you need an idea. Let's recap. You need an idea.
[10:22.860 --> 10:27.860]  What is the show about? Is it about boats and hoes? Is it about cars and coffee?
[10:27.860 --> 10:32.860]  Is it about weed and whiskey? Is it about growing dope? Is it about playing guitar?
[10:32.860 --> 10:34.860]  Is it about sneakers? Is there a sneaker podcast out there?
[10:34.860 --> 10:37.860]  There are a lot of great podcasts. What's your show about?
[10:37.860 --> 10:39.860]  So you need an idea. Then you need a creative name.
[10:39.860 --> 10:42.860]  All the podcasts need a real cool name. Then you need equipment.
[10:42.860 --> 10:45.860]  Obviously, you need a microphone. Your iPhone would work.
[10:45.860 --> 10:51.860]  Something to get your voice into a digital format. That's either a USB device, a computer.
[10:51.860 --> 10:53.860]  That's the basics of it.
[10:53.860 --> 10:58.860]  Like, again, I go from the mic to the Cloudlifter to a USB interface, and that goes to the camera.
[10:58.860 --> 11:04.860]  Most of the time, that would go to a computer, and you'd record it onto the computer or a drive on the USB device.
[11:04.860 --> 11:06.860]  Then you can edit it in software from there.
[11:06.860 --> 11:12.860]  Then it's got to go to an RSS feed, which you can create that using – there are a lot of ways to do it.
[11:12.860 --> 11:15.860]  I've built my own website and put my RSS feed in my own website.
[11:15.860 --> 11:19.860]  It's much easier that way for me because I've got the website.
[11:19.860 --> 11:23.860]  For some people, you don't have a website. You may want to use an RSS hosting service.
[11:23.860 --> 11:29.860]  Libsyn is great. Libsyn is short for Liberated Syndicate, so it's just L-I-B-S-Y-N.
[11:29.860 --> 11:32.860]  There are a couple other services out there that would work for you.
[11:33.860 --> 11:36.860]  Nobody pays me. I don't get any advertising fees or any sponsorships.
[11:36.860 --> 11:38.860]  I know that Libsyn is a good product.
[11:38.860 --> 11:40.860]  All right, so you're going to need gear, an idea.
[11:40.860 --> 11:44.860]  Then you're going to need an RSS feed, something about the gear.
[11:44.860 --> 11:49.860]  I keep talking about equipment and kind of getting – I don't want to be too specific about the gear that you should buy.
[11:49.860 --> 11:51.860]  It's kind of about your budget and what works for you.
[11:51.860 --> 11:53.860]  There are a couple things to think about.
[11:53.860 --> 11:57.860]  I come from the music industry. I used to work at Guitar Center.
[11:57.860 --> 12:03.860]  I saw plenty of people buy guitars for their kids that were never going to make their kids excited about playing music
[12:03.860 --> 12:07.860]  because no matter what you do to that guitar, it's going to sound like a fucking box with strings on it.
[12:07.860 --> 12:13.860]  It's a piece of wood with strings to make kids think they got a guitar, to dupe parents into giving Guitar Center $100.
[12:13.860 --> 12:16.860]  Never going to work out well for you. The kid's going to hate it.
[12:16.860 --> 12:21.860]  If they would have spent $250 on a guitar, they could have got a guitar that sounds fucking good every time they play it.
[12:21.860 --> 12:24.860]  That kid would be playing guitar every day and be excited about it.
[12:24.860 --> 12:30.860]  Get equipment that is not the cheapest. Get something that inspires you to use it, something that makes you sound good.
[12:30.860 --> 12:33.860]  Also, get equipment that you can use.
[12:33.860 --> 12:37.860]  There are a lot of buttons, a lot of knobs, a lot of toys when you get into podcasting.
[12:37.860 --> 12:41.860]  I don't know your technical abilities or limitations or experience.
[12:41.860 --> 12:43.860]  I don't know anything about you right now.
[12:43.860 --> 12:50.860]  So I'm just politely saying get the gear that works for your ability because you can definitely outgear yourself.
[12:50.860 --> 12:54.860]  I did it when I moved up from the audio format to the video format.
[12:54.860 --> 12:57.860]  That was a learning curve. I outgeared myself.
[12:57.860 --> 13:01.860]  My computer said, oh, you're going to put videos into me? You got to get a new computer.
[13:01.860 --> 13:04.860]  So I got a new computer and then I realized, oh, this is really easy to edit this.
[13:04.860 --> 13:07.860]  I want to get a 4K camera. I got a 4K camera.
[13:07.860 --> 13:09.860]  And the computer was like, nope, got to upgrade one more time.
[13:09.860 --> 13:12.860]  So I had to upgrade again. There was a huge learning curve.
[13:12.860 --> 13:15.860]  Learning to sync two videos together and get the audio and everything right.
[13:15.860 --> 13:16.860]  That was a learning curve.
[13:16.860 --> 13:21.860]  So get the gear that is within your technical abilities. Don't outgear yourself.
[13:21.860 --> 13:25.860]  That is something that I see musicians, podcasters, men.
[13:25.860 --> 13:27.860]  We like to just fucking outgear ourselves.
[13:27.860 --> 13:30.860]  If we've made a couple of bucks this month and we got into a new hobby,
[13:30.860 --> 13:34.860]  you can guarantee I'm going to buy something fucking ridiculous to go with my new hobby.
[13:34.860 --> 13:38.860]  I don't just want cupcakes. I want cupcakes with fucking sprinkles if I'm doing cupcakes.
[13:38.860 --> 13:42.860]  All right. So get an idea. Get good equipment. Get an RSS feed.
[13:43.860 --> 13:48.860]  Get equipment that you can afford, but is good equipment that is not cheap equipment that inspires you to work,
[13:48.860 --> 13:51.860]  but is also not too confusing for you.
[13:51.860 --> 13:56.860]  Then the hardest part for some people is just sit down and fucking press record.
[13:56.860 --> 13:59.860]  If it's a solo podcast, you've only got to wait for you to get in the room.
[13:59.860 --> 14:04.860]  I can record today. Full disclosure, it is 640 p.m. as I record right now.
[14:04.860 --> 14:08.860]  The last episode I recorded, I think I completed around three in the morning.
[14:08.860 --> 14:11.860]  So I can record whenever I want. It's just me chilling.
[14:11.860 --> 14:17.860]  I've got a really weird schedule with my life. I fit in podcasts when I feel I've got to be in the mood.
[14:17.860 --> 14:21.860]  I've got to be in the zone. If I'm tired, if I'm lazy, the podcast won't be any good.
[14:21.860 --> 14:24.860]  So I wait till I'm uppity. I've had some food. I've had some smoke.
[14:24.860 --> 14:28.860]  I've had some kombucha in my bloodstream. I'm going. I feel good. I can do a good podcast.
[14:28.860 --> 14:33.860]  So just do it. If you're solo, sit down and do it. If you've got to wait for other people,
[14:33.860 --> 14:39.860]  that is one of the hardest things about podcasting is getting one, two, or three other people to join you for the show.
[14:39.860 --> 14:45.860]  Unless there's advertising money or some sort of commitment on the line, it's really hard to get people there.
[14:45.860 --> 14:50.860]  So the hardest part is just go. Make an outline for episode one. Make an outline for episode two.
[14:50.860 --> 14:54.860]  Make an outline for episode three. Hit record and bang out episode one.
[14:54.860 --> 14:59.860]  Maybe if you really want to, I wouldn't even do it, record episode zero.
[14:59.860 --> 15:04.860]  Put on the cameras, put on the microphones and just talk for 30 minutes with your friends.
[15:04.860 --> 15:09.860]  See what it's like and then take notes as you're doing it. The guy on mic one talks too much.
[15:09.860 --> 15:15.860]  The guy on mic three is too quiet. The girl on mic four, we can barely hear her because we got to turn up her microphone.
[15:15.860 --> 15:18.860]  The camera wasn't picking up the guest in chair number three.
[15:18.860 --> 15:24.860]  Just write down the things you're noticing for episode zero and then everybody watch episode zero together.
[15:24.860 --> 15:29.860]  And then you have an idea what you do and do not want to do. I like episode one.
[15:29.860 --> 15:34.860]  Just do episode one and put it out. Then you've got documentation of where the show was in the beginning.
[15:34.860 --> 15:39.860]  This show is nothing like what it was in episode one. I have come so far.
[15:39.860 --> 15:45.860]  That's a totally different podcast. My approach, my delivery, my editing, everything is way different.
[15:45.860 --> 15:50.860]  And I am slightly embarrassed of episode one, but also that's where we were at that time.
[15:50.860 --> 15:54.860]  It's a time capsule. I could easily take it off the internet, but why?
[15:54.860 --> 15:57.860]  That's what I said. That's what we did. That's how it was. It is there.
[15:57.860 --> 16:02.860]  So just press record. Just go. The hardest part of starting a podcast is starting.
[16:02.860 --> 16:06.860]  I know so many people that have the idea. They've drawn the logo. They've built the RSS feed.
[16:06.860 --> 16:10.860]  They got the fucking $600 microphone sitting on the table. They've got everything.
[16:10.860 --> 16:16.860]  They've played around. They've done sound check, but they've never sat down and said, hi, I'm Rasta Jeff.
[16:16.860 --> 16:20.860]  This is my podcast. This is what it's going to be about. Join me.
[16:20.860 --> 16:24.860]  There's going to be a lot of growth and a lot of progression through this time of developing this podcast.
[16:24.860 --> 16:29.860]  And I hope that you're here from the beginning all the way until the end, whenever that may be.
[16:29.860 --> 16:32.860]  Tell your friends if you're interested in this show, we'd love to hear from you.
[16:32.860 --> 16:37.860]  Then start saying what you've got to say. The first couple episodes are going to feel fucking weird.
[16:37.860 --> 16:42.860]  They're going to come out terribly. But guess what? You've got infinite episodes to improve,
[16:42.860 --> 16:47.860]  and your audience will come along with you. If you listen to the show, you are a Patreon contributor,
[16:47.860 --> 16:53.860]  a patron, you see the community that we have developed along with this podcast.
[16:53.860 --> 16:58.860]  If I post a YouTube video and somebody doesn't like something I said in there and they attack me,
[16:58.860 --> 17:03.860]  I sit back and laugh because all of my social media followers, all of my YouTube supporters,
[17:03.860 --> 17:08.860]  all of the iRi Army, all of the podcast listeners, they roast the person who tried to bash me,
[17:08.860 --> 17:12.860]  and I don't even have to say anything. That is the type of community that we have built.
[17:12.860 --> 17:17.860]  And all it took was consecutive, reliable episodes that are real. They're from my heart.
[17:17.860 --> 17:22.860]  Like I said a moment ago, I don't record a show that I'm not feeling. If I'm not feeling it, I just won't do it.
[17:22.860 --> 17:27.860]  I'll say, oh, wait, I make my own schedule. I know there's a timeline for the show. I know there are deadlines.
[17:27.860 --> 17:30.860]  And sometimes I don't work until there's pressure. The show comes out Monday and Thursday.
[17:30.860 --> 17:34.860]  Sometimes it's fucking Wednesday night, and I'm like, oh, I've got to record right now.
[17:34.860 --> 17:38.860]  And I get the show out, and it's beautiful. But love it. Love what you do. Do what you love.
[17:38.860 --> 17:44.860]  Make it a podcast about what you enjoy. Start talking. Get it out there. Share that community.
[17:44.860 --> 17:50.860]  Build the community. Then the next note on my paper here is build an audience and interact with them.
[17:50.860 --> 17:53.860]  Build a social media following that goes along with your podcast.
[17:53.860 --> 17:58.860]  Do as much as you can to interact with the people that make your show successful.
[17:58.860 --> 18:05.860]  You can do what you can do to make the show great. You can produce it, write it, edit it, put it out there, spam it everywhere.
[18:05.860 --> 18:09.860]  But it's up to the audience to make it successful. They've got to enjoy it. They've got to share it.
[18:09.860 --> 18:14.860]  They've got to listen to it. They've got to tell their friends. They've got to find some sort of value in that show.
[18:14.860 --> 18:19.860]  So advertise the show. Share it to your community. Interact with your community.
[18:19.860 --> 18:24.860]  I try to interact. There are so many of you and one of me. I know that sounds egotistical or whatever,
[18:24.860 --> 18:28.860]  but there's just one of me, and I get a thousand messages a day. I try. You guys, I try.
[18:28.860 --> 18:34.860]  But do your best to interact with your community. I try to address you guys via Patreon, here, social media.
[18:34.860 --> 18:39.860]  I try, but I'm really spread thin lately, and it's not going to ease up, which is a good thing.
[18:39.860 --> 18:43.860]  When things are busy, that means business is successful. When it slows down, I start freaking out.
[18:44.860 --> 18:50.860]  Advertise your stuff. Find ways to advertise your podcast. Social media is free. It's the best.
[18:50.860 --> 18:57.860]  Find certain niches. What is your podcast about? Is it underwater basket weaving? Is it medieval shield making?
[18:57.860 --> 19:03.860]  Is it fucking tattoos? Tattoos are cool by themselves. An audio podcast about tattoos would be awkward, though.
[19:03.860 --> 19:07.860]  Anyway, what is your podcast about? Let's say your podcast is about tattoos.
[19:07.860 --> 19:12.860]  Advertise in a tattoo magazine, if that's what you want to do. Go where the tattoo people are.
[19:12.860 --> 19:17.860]  Then find the fringe of where the tattoo people are. Where also are they? They're in pop culture.
[19:17.860 --> 19:21.860]  They're in the motorcycle world. They're in the fashion world. They're in the hair world.
[19:21.860 --> 19:24.860]  At the barber shop, you could advertise your tattoo podcast.
[19:24.860 --> 19:29.860]  Think about other ways to advertise and get out of your bubble, but also include your bubble,
[19:29.860 --> 19:32.860]  because you want your crowd to be your crowd.
[19:32.860 --> 19:38.860]  So, get an idea. Get some gear. Create an RSS feed. Then, press fucking record and start going.
[19:39.860 --> 19:43.860]  It's going to feel weird. I know I've said that before. I still hate editing my own podcast.
[19:43.860 --> 19:46.860]  It bugs me to just sit there and listen to me for 30 minutes.
[19:46.860 --> 19:51.860]  I've already said all this shit once. I don't want to listen to it again and make sure I got it right, but I have to.
[19:51.860 --> 19:56.860]  So, you'll get used to hearing your own voice. It'll drive you crazy, but just accept it.
[19:56.860 --> 20:01.860]  Other people are going to like it. It's okay. They've been listening to you talk your whole life. It will be okay.
[20:01.860 --> 20:04.860]  Press record. Then, put the show up on the internet.
[20:05.860 --> 20:08.860]  Wait. Just let people respond. Let them react.
[20:08.860 --> 20:12.860]  Then, consistently and reliably put out your episodes on a schedule.
[20:12.860 --> 20:14.860]  That is really important, in my opinion.
[20:14.860 --> 20:17.860]  My people know that Monday and Thursday, there's a show.
[20:17.860 --> 20:19.860]  If the show isn't there, I get messages.
[20:19.860 --> 20:21.860]  They're waiting. They're hungry. They're relying on me.
[20:21.860 --> 20:25.860]  You'll begin to manifest relationships with your audience, and you'll start remembering people
[20:25.860 --> 20:28.860]  when they start emailing you and messaging you. You'll know who they are.
[20:28.860 --> 20:33.860]  So, get some gear. Get an RSS feed. Press record. Say what you've got to say.
[20:33.860 --> 20:35.860]  Edit it to make it feel good, if you want to.
[20:35.860 --> 20:38.860]  Post it up to the internet, and wait to see what the world says.
[20:38.860 --> 20:44.860]  Then, when the world bashes you, don't be surprised because the internet is a big old hater.
[20:44.860 --> 20:49.860]  Think about this. When you go to a restaurant, how often do you tell the staff,
[20:49.860 --> 20:52.860]  this food was perfect. Everything was what I ordered. It was great.
[20:52.860 --> 20:56.860]  You don't really say that, but if something, one little thing was wrong,
[20:56.860 --> 20:58.860]  you'll fucking make sure to tell them.
[20:58.860 --> 21:01.860]  I ordered this. I got this. I'm not happy.
[21:01.860 --> 21:03.860]  The internet is that times 20.
[21:03.860 --> 21:07.860]  If somebody's happy, they'll go, I'm happy. They might click like on your video.
[21:07.860 --> 21:10.860]  Maybe if you're really lucky, come on guys, click like for me, please.
[21:10.860 --> 21:14.860]  Maybe if they loved the shit out of your video, maybe they'll click like.
[21:14.860 --> 21:17.860]  If you really touched their lives, maybe they'll subscribe.
[21:17.860 --> 21:21.860]  If you said one second of one word wrong, watch your comment section because you're fucked.
[21:21.860 --> 21:23.860]  That's just the way the internet works.
[21:23.860 --> 21:27.860]  So, develop a thick skin. You've got to have thick skin when it comes to the internet.
[21:27.860 --> 21:31.860]  Another thing I want to touch on is something called imposter syndrome.
[21:31.860 --> 21:36.860]  Somewhere along the line of your podcasting career, you will think to yourself,
[21:36.860 --> 21:40.860]  why am I podcasting about my chosen topic? Who do I think I am?
[21:40.860 --> 21:45.860]  Am I weed wizard of Oz? Am I weed Jesus? Am I cannabis Christ?
[21:45.860 --> 21:47.860]  I'm just Rasta Jeff. I'm just some dude growing weed.
[21:47.860 --> 21:50.860]  Why would anybody want to listen to me? Why am I doing this?
[21:50.860 --> 21:52.860]  I'm embarrassed. I feel weird.
[21:52.860 --> 21:56.860]  But then I remember, oh, I do this because I'm fucking passionate about it.
[21:56.860 --> 22:01.860]  I care about this. I want other people to be able to grow as good of herb as I can
[22:01.860 --> 22:06.860]  so they can medicate or recreate as comfortably and often as I'm able to.
[22:06.860 --> 22:09.860]  I want to cut people's cost of medication down.
[22:09.860 --> 22:11.860]  I want to improve the quality of their medicine.
[22:11.860 --> 22:15.860]  My overall goal is to have people growing better weed so we can all smoke better weed
[22:15.860 --> 22:19.860]  to improve the overall quality of all of our lives.
[22:19.860 --> 22:22.860]  So I remember that and I go, that's why you're doing the fucking podcast.
[22:22.860 --> 22:25.860]  No matter what the Internet says, no matter what the trolls say,
[22:25.860 --> 22:28.860]  I'm doing what I'm setting out to do and I know that I'm successful
[22:28.860 --> 22:32.860]  because you guys are sending me messages, you're sending me Patreon support,
[22:32.860 --> 22:34.860]  you're just sending me love and praise.
[22:34.860 --> 22:37.860]  So imposter syndrome will kick in. Don't let it get to you.
[22:37.860 --> 22:42.860]  Don't let imposter syndrome win. It'll come in. It just kicks in one day.
[22:42.860 --> 22:44.860]  It's usually around episode 5 or episode 30.
[22:44.860 --> 22:47.860]  You'll start going, oh, what am I doing? Why am I doing this?
[22:47.860 --> 22:51.860]  Push through the imposter syndrome. You're doing this because you are the one to do this.
[22:51.860 --> 22:56.860]  You chose to do this. Whatever you believe in chose you to be the spokesperson for this.
[22:56.860 --> 22:58.860]  You guys know what I believe and I call myself Rasta Jeff.
[22:58.860 --> 23:02.860]  They call me Rasta Jeff. I believe the most I jaw has called me
[23:02.860 --> 23:05.860]  and asks me politely to teach you guys how to grow cannabis.
[23:05.860 --> 23:10.860]  If I didn't use this gift that I've got, I've got the gift to read a paper
[23:10.860 --> 23:13.860]  and get some instructions and then go apply that in my grow room
[23:13.860 --> 23:17.860]  and make the paper into useful data because what it says on paper is often good theory,
[23:17.860 --> 23:20.860]  but in practice in the grow room, it doesn't fucking work.
[23:20.860 --> 23:22.860]  The books are written by people who have never grown the weed.
[23:22.860 --> 23:25.860]  They've only talked about it and read about it and been to college.
[23:25.860 --> 23:27.860]  They've never been in the grow room. I've been in there.
[23:27.860 --> 23:32.860]  So I read the book. I went in the grow room and I'm able to take my reading and my hands on
[23:32.860 --> 23:37.860]  and I can spit it back out in a way that most people can enjoy and absorb and learn from it.
[23:37.860 --> 23:40.860]  If I didn't do that, if I didn't put that gift back out to the world,
[23:40.860 --> 23:44.860]  I feel it would be disrespectful to whatever you believe in.
[23:44.860 --> 23:47.860]  You know what I believe in. I'm not judgmental on what you believe in.
[23:47.860 --> 23:49.860]  I agree with you. We just call it by a different name, bro.
[23:49.860 --> 23:53.860]  Whatever you believe in gave us both this desire to do a podcast.
[23:53.860 --> 23:56.860]  So do it, put it out there for the people. Do it from your heart.
[23:56.860 --> 23:58.860]  I always say grow from your heart, breed with love.
[23:58.860 --> 24:03.860]  Bro, podcast from your heart, speak with love. Get that message out there and it will work.
[24:03.860 --> 24:08.860]  All right. I wanted to do another message in this show, but the message I've got is going to be very long
[24:08.860 --> 24:12.860]  and I feel like I rambled for long enough about how to start a podcast.
[24:12.860 --> 24:14.860]  That is going to be it for this episode.
[24:14.860 --> 24:17.860]  My buddy Orville, thank you for the great question.
[24:17.860 --> 24:19.860]  I hope I inspired somebody out there to start a podcast.
[24:19.860 --> 24:24.860]  If you've got any follow-up questions, if you've got any corrections, concerns, or if you need more info,
[24:24.860 --> 24:29.860]  I would love to hear from you. Check me out on patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[24:29.860 --> 24:34.860]  Of course, the email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[24:34.860 --> 24:37.860]  Everything else is on the website at iRegenetics.com.
[24:37.860 --> 24:40.860]  There's a link to iRedirect where you could get your discounted packs.
[24:40.860 --> 24:44.860]  There's a link to the web store where you can get your iRegenetics t-shirts.
[24:44.860 --> 24:47.860]  There will be new merch coming very soon also.
[24:47.860 --> 24:50.860]  Check out the website. That's what I'm saying. Join us on the website.
[24:50.860 --> 24:52.860]  All the cool kids are doing it. Why wouldn't you?
[24:52.860 --> 24:56.860]  That is all I've got for this episode. I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[24:56.860 --> 24:59.860]  I want to give a big shout out to my buddy Billy Bong Smokin'.
[24:59.860 --> 25:03.860]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
