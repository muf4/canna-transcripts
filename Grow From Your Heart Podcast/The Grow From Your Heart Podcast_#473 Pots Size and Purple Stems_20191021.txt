[00:00.000 --> 00:03.480]  What? Is it working? It's going. Here we go. What's up, ladies and gentlemen, boys and
[00:03.480 --> 00:08.400]  girls, pimps and hoes, chicks and bros, friends and foes, smokers and growers, dab stars,
[00:08.400 --> 00:12.640]  weed smokers. What's up, boys and girls? It is time for episode 473 of the Grow From Your
[00:12.640 --> 00:16.760]  Heart podcast. This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here
[00:16.760 --> 00:21.680]  Now. If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[00:21.680 --> 00:31.680]  recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com. I like to start
[00:31.680 --> 00:35.900]  this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking. Today, I've got a special treat.
[00:35.900 --> 00:40.880]  I have got some banana orange cookies, full spectrum extract from my friends at Green
[00:40.880 --> 00:46.520]  Dot Labs. This is a blend of banana cush and orange cookies. The label says it should taste
[00:46.520 --> 00:50.760]  like banana orange smoothie, but I think it tastes more like banana cush and orange
[00:50.760 --> 00:56.200]  cookies. This concentrate was delicious, and it got me stoned as fuck. A lot of times,
[00:56.200 --> 00:59.680]  a concentrate will get me high. It makes my eyes kind of bug out of my head. It makes
[00:59.680 --> 01:04.200]  me go super fast and talkative. This shit made me want to just sit down. I wanted to
[01:04.200 --> 01:09.460]  chill out after dabbing the banana orange cookies. Full spectrum extract. I'm flipping
[01:09.460 --> 01:15.520]  it over to read the back of the label. It says that this product contains 77% THC. I'm
[01:15.520 --> 01:21.360]  going to crack it open to give you a fresh smell. The first aroma is straight up orange
[01:21.360 --> 01:25.320]  Julius. If you've ever had like an orange smoothie, that's the original aroma that hits
[01:25.320 --> 01:31.760]  you, followed by a hint of cookie dough with maybe a touch of black pepper. I know that's
[01:31.760 --> 01:36.520]  a really interesting aroma, a combo of flavors there, but my nose picks up a lot of stuff.
[01:36.520 --> 01:41.240]  When you dab it, it tastes just like you're smoking the banana cush and orange cookies.
[01:41.240 --> 01:45.560]  If you know what those strains taste like, it's got that smooth, cushy flavor, maybe
[01:45.560 --> 01:51.280]  a hint of the banana runs, and then it has got also a really orange smoothie sort of
[01:51.280 --> 01:56.320]  a flavor. So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious full spectrum
[01:56.320 --> 02:02.040]  extract, the banana orange cookies full spectrum extract. Obviously I'm stoned as shit. Ladies
[02:02.040 --> 02:05.920]  and gentlemen, in this episode, I'm going to read a couple of listener emails. Before
[02:05.920 --> 02:11.080]  we get there, I should do some shout outs to a few of our friends on Patreon. Let's
[02:11.080 --> 02:14.280]  start off with a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and thank you to my
[02:14.280 --> 02:19.000]  friend JM. How about a big thank you to Todd K. I want to send a big giant Grow From Your
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.640]  Heart podcast shout out to Blackbird. How about a giant thank you to Zoso J. I owe a
[02:23.640 --> 02:27.720]  big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you and a shout out to Melvin818. How about a
[02:27.720 --> 02:32.440]  big shout out to Mike F. I want to send a big thank you to Sephirot. Of course a giant
[02:32.440 --> 02:36.520]  Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to my buddy Farmer John. And of course, last
[02:36.520 --> 02:41.040]  but certainly not least, I want to send a giant thank you shout out to our buddy Gregory
[02:41.040 --> 02:45.280]  S. If you are listening to the show and you'd like to learn how to contribute to the show,
[02:45.280 --> 02:52.200]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com slash growfromyourheart. All of the information
[02:52.200 --> 02:56.720]  you need will be right there on the screen. Once again, big shout out and big thank you
[02:56.720 --> 03:02.200]  to all of our friends who continue to support the show on Patreon. All right, podcast world
[03:02.240 --> 03:05.400]  at the start of the show, I did say I was going to read some listener emails. Let's
[03:05.400 --> 03:10.040]  get right into that part. If you've got a grow question, a cultivation question, a cannabis
[03:10.040 --> 03:14.280]  culture question, I would love to hear from you. You can send me an email. My email address
[03:14.280 --> 03:20.800]  is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. The first email in today's episode goes just like this.
[03:20.800 --> 03:25.240]  It says, hey, my name is, and then at the end they say, I would like to remain anonymous.
[03:25.240 --> 03:29.640]  So my name is Anonymous. I'm a first time grower. I'm growing for my dad since he has
[03:29.640 --> 03:36.320]  quit using fentanyl patches after 10 years and now uses cannabis for his pain. Purchasing
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.760]  from dispensaries has become expensive, so we have decided to start growing. There's
[03:40.760 --> 03:44.240]  a lot of good stuff to talk about here. We've got a first time grower, so welcome to the
[03:44.240 --> 03:47.680]  club. Welcome to the family. Thank you for listening to the show. I hope I'm able to
[03:47.680 --> 03:51.480]  guide you through this and give you a good first grow experience. I hope I make it easier
[03:51.480 --> 03:56.840]  for you. Congrats to your dad for quitting the fentanyl patches for 10 years. That shit
[03:56.840 --> 04:01.200]  is not good for you. I hope that cannabis is able to ease the pain and I hope that it
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.600]  makes his life more enjoyable and I hope it makes your time together more enjoyable. Then
[04:05.600 --> 04:09.880]  you were totally correct. Purchasing from a dispensary can get quite expensive. So that
[04:09.880 --> 04:14.280]  is where many folks like yourself decide to start growing their own. The email goes on
[04:14.280 --> 04:19.240]  to say, I have a question about planting right into the final pot. For example, planting
[04:19.240 --> 04:23.580]  into a five gallon pot. I know that you have to carefully water it until its roots grow
[04:23.580 --> 04:28.080]  into the space, but I would just like to hear the pros and cons. Being a first time
[04:28.080 --> 04:33.180]  grower makes everything really intimidating, even though I've had some help from an experienced
[04:33.180 --> 04:34.180]  friend.
[04:34.180 --> 04:37.580]  So we've got a great question about pot size. I'm going to get into that in just a moment.
[04:37.580 --> 04:41.360]  I want to keep reading the message. It says I built a grow cabinet for stealth growing
[04:41.360 --> 04:45.400]  since it's illegal to grow within 20 miles of any dispensary. You know, I really don't
[04:45.400 --> 04:48.920]  like that rule since there's a shop 25 miles away. They don't think you should be able
[04:48.920 --> 04:53.220]  to grow your own, but people that are 26 miles away can produce a product that they can use.
[04:53.360 --> 04:57.720]  That's not fair in my opinion. Nothing I can do about that except express my opinion that
[04:57.720 --> 05:02.080]  it's bullshit. I'm going to keep moving. The dimensions of our grow box is four feet by
[05:02.080 --> 05:06.440]  two feet and five and a half feet tall. So we've got very minimal space, still adequate
[05:06.440 --> 05:14.280]  space to provide our own medicine. The light source is an LED HLG V2 3000K quantum board
[05:14.280 --> 05:20.720]  with an AC infinity T4 fan. I'm planting into organic soil with a 70-30 mix of perlite.
[05:20.720 --> 05:25.220]  This sounds good so far. The pH, I don't worry about too much of the pH in the soil.
[05:25.220 --> 05:29.980]  You're at 80 degrees. That's going to be a little bit warm with about 50 to 55% relative
[05:29.980 --> 05:35.300]  humidity. I just planted my first seed yesterday into a five gallon smart pot. I want to keep
[05:35.300 --> 05:39.700]  everything organic. So far, it sounds like you've got a good idea and you're off to a
[05:39.700 --> 05:43.820]  good start. It wraps up with, I love your podcasts. I'm just getting into them and I'm
[05:43.820 --> 05:50.380]  learning so much from listening. Thank you for reading from your friend Anonymous. There's
[05:50.400 --> 05:53.240]  a lot of great stuff in here. Thank you for listening to the show. I appreciate that.
[05:53.240 --> 05:57.440]  They said they are listening and learning so much. So that means a lot to me. I put
[05:57.440 --> 06:01.240]  a lot of effort into this show. So to know that at least one person is learning, that
[06:01.240 --> 06:05.920]  means a lot. Let's talk a little bit about the main question here, planting into the
[06:05.920 --> 06:10.740]  final pot. So this person has planted their first seedling directly into a five gallon
[06:10.740 --> 06:15.960]  smart pot. They have got a 70-30 mix of perlite. They're planted into organic soil. It sounds
[06:15.960 --> 06:19.800]  like they've got a decent grow environment. Their main question is, they would like to
[06:19.800 --> 06:24.940]  hear the pros and cons of directly planting into that five gallon pot. Now there are pros
[06:24.940 --> 06:30.380]  and cons to this. Absolutely. I would prefer to go into a smaller container first. Then
[06:30.380 --> 06:34.220]  as my plant gets larger, of course I would transplant into a larger container until I
[06:34.220 --> 06:38.820]  was in the final pot, which that plant would finish in. There are several advantages to
[06:38.820 --> 06:44.060]  starting in a smaller container. I will start my seedlings or my clones in a very small
[06:44.060 --> 06:50.920]  pot. It is not uncommon for me to start seedlings or clones in a beer cup or a six inch net
[06:50.920 --> 06:54.500]  pot. If I use a beer cup, I poke plenty of holes in the bottom of the cup to get plenty
[06:54.500 --> 06:59.960]  of drainage, or I will use a four inch or a six inch net pot for small plants. Now let's
[06:59.960 --> 07:06.040]  talk about why I do this. I don't need to use as much water to water a cup or a four
[07:06.040 --> 07:10.920]  inch or a six inch net pot as I would if I were trying to saturate a three, a five or
[07:10.920 --> 07:16.500]  a seven gallon pot filled with this soil or soilless mix. Now in a small personal garden,
[07:16.500 --> 07:20.680]  these small details may not matter a whole lot, but when I get to a commercial scale,
[07:20.680 --> 07:24.580]  when I've got a whole bunch of plants, this is going to make a huge difference. I only
[07:24.580 --> 07:30.100]  need one cup of water to water two cups with plants in them. If I've got them in seven
[07:30.100 --> 07:35.280]  gallon pots, it's going to take me two, maybe four gallons of water to fully saturate those
[07:35.280 --> 07:39.980]  seven gallon pots. Now if you scale that up and scale that up on a commercial environment,
[07:40.040 --> 07:44.380]  each gallon becomes more expensive. I'm putting nutrients in it. I've got to have a person
[07:44.380 --> 07:49.560]  mix it. I've got to have a person pH it. Everything starts to get more costly as we scale things
[07:49.560 --> 07:54.200]  up. So I don't need as much water. I don't need as much nutrient if I'm using a smaller
[07:54.200 --> 08:00.000]  container. I also give myself less of a chance of drowning or overwatering my plant if I'm
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.720]  using a smaller container. I know that sounds backwards and that large container, you need
[08:04.720 --> 08:09.800]  to fully saturate all of that soil or soilless mix or cocoa the first time you put that plant
[08:09.800 --> 08:13.980]  in there. You've got a lot of volume to saturate, which is going to take a large volume of
[08:13.980 --> 08:19.180]  water. Your plant is going to get really wet. That container is going to take a really long
[08:19.180 --> 08:23.700]  time to dry out. Your plant will have a very good opportunity to get root rot. There's
[08:23.700 --> 08:28.540]  going to be too much water for too long in that container. If you overwater that smaller
[08:28.540 --> 08:33.460]  container, it will dry up much more quickly. So you've got an opportunity to rescue that
[08:33.460 --> 08:37.680]  plant and you're not going to be pouring in as much water anyway because the container
[08:37.680 --> 08:43.580]  is not as large and you're not attempting to saturate as much soil, soilless mix, cocoa,
[08:43.580 --> 08:47.620]  whatever you've chosen to put in your container. So the first advantage is you don't need as
[08:47.620 --> 08:53.100]  much water and you run less of a risk of drowning that plant on the first couple of waterings.
[08:53.100 --> 08:57.860]  The second advantage is those smaller pots don't require as much space. Now that doesn't
[08:57.860 --> 09:02.580]  really make a big deal in a small personal grow, but as we expand to a commercial environment,
[09:02.580 --> 09:07.920]  every inch costs a lot of money. Real estate is expensive. Every square foot of my grow
[09:07.920 --> 09:12.340]  needs to be filled with productive plants. And I also need to be able to fit as many
[09:12.340 --> 09:17.020]  plants as I can in some of these tight veg spaces. So it would be a bit of a waste of
[09:17.020 --> 09:22.440]  space for me to put small plants into three, five or seven gallon pots. If you think about
[09:22.440 --> 09:29.140]  it, a five gallon pot is probably approximately 14 to 16 inches around. And even when you
[09:29.140 --> 09:33.980]  press a bunch of five gallon pots together, you still waste a bunch of space because even
[09:33.980 --> 09:37.940]  when the pots are edge to edge, you get that little diamond worth of space between each
[09:37.940 --> 09:43.580]  pot that you cannot fill. So five gallon pots eat up a lot of space. I could reduce all
[09:43.580 --> 09:48.980]  of that space by putting the plants into four or six inch net pots and I can fit probably,
[09:48.980 --> 09:55.860]  I'm just guessing about 20, 25, maybe 30 four inch net pots under a T5 light comfortably.
[09:55.860 --> 10:00.340]  But I'm visualizing in my head that I can maybe fit six or eight, maybe nine or 12,
[10:00.340 --> 10:05.260]  five or seven gallon pots under the same T5 light. So that takes up a lot of unnecessary
[10:05.260 --> 10:09.940]  space and in a commercial environment, when you start expanding the numbers, that space
[10:09.940 --> 10:15.620]  really gets eaten up quite quickly. So I really like to utilize my space by using a smaller
[10:15.620 --> 10:19.820]  pot and then when the plant grows into that pot, that's when I up pot it to the next pot.
[10:19.820 --> 10:25.140]  So that brings me to the next reason I prefer to start in smaller pots. If the plants are
[10:25.140 --> 10:28.940]  healthy, if they're being fed well, if they're getting a good root inoculation, some sort
[10:28.940 --> 10:32.260]  of beneficial fungus and some microbes and you've got good lighting on them and they
[10:32.260 --> 10:36.980]  aren't experiencing any problems and they're being watered properly, we should start seeing
[10:36.980 --> 10:42.100]  some dynamic explosive root growth and those pots should get filled quite quickly. As soon
[10:42.100 --> 10:46.180]  as those pots are kind of filled and the plants are getting a little bit root bound, that's
[10:46.180 --> 10:50.860]  when I like to transplant. I like to flip the pot upside down and get the plant out
[10:50.860 --> 10:55.020]  to where the plant is hanging between my middle finger and my ring finger to where the plant
[10:55.020 --> 10:59.820]  is completely upside down. Then I basically lift the pot off of the plant like it's the
[10:59.820 --> 11:05.140]  lid. Then I've got the roots in my hand. I've usually got so much root development that
[11:05.140 --> 11:10.020]  the cocoa stays completely pressed together at this time. Nothing falls out. That's how
[11:10.020 --> 11:15.380]  tight I let them grow. I will take my fingers of my other hand and just dig it directly
[11:15.380 --> 11:19.460]  into the middle of the bottom of that pot. I'm just going, now it's the top because the
[11:19.460 --> 11:22.860]  plant's upside down. I'm going straight in from the top, directly in the middle and just
[11:22.860 --> 11:27.300]  wiggle my fingers a little bit. My idea is to just break those roots up and break that
[11:27.300 --> 11:32.220]  dirt up a little bit to where when I put it into the next pot, those roots just take off.
[11:32.220 --> 11:37.220]  They say, oh, I was in there a little bit tight, but now watch me explode and watch
[11:37.220 --> 11:42.820]  me stretch. If you transplant properly into the next pot, if you don't bury them too deep,
[11:42.820 --> 11:46.360]  if you sprinkle like a little root inoculant, maybe some recharge or something like that
[11:46.360 --> 11:50.660]  on there and you bury them properly and then you water them properly and put them back
[11:50.660 --> 11:54.440]  under the right lights and give them enough airflow and enough love, those roots will
[11:54.440 --> 11:59.140]  take off and those plants will show you vigorous, robust growth.
[11:59.140 --> 12:03.500]  So I really think that trapping the roots just a little bit and letting it get just
[12:03.500 --> 12:08.060]  a little bit compacted in that pot, then when you put it in the next pot, it really makes
[12:08.060 --> 12:12.260]  it take off. It is like, hell yeah, there is some freedom. Also, it's got big tires
[12:12.260 --> 12:16.140]  now so it can go romping through the mud. You're not going to have a problem with drowning
[12:16.140 --> 12:19.180]  it when you transplant into the next container.
[12:19.180 --> 12:23.460]  So the first advantage to starting with either a beer cup or a four inch or a six inch net
[12:23.460 --> 12:28.540]  pot, or sometimes I even use those four inch nursery pots or a little six inch nursery
[12:28.540 --> 12:32.420]  pot, just something smaller to consolidate and condense the garden a little bit. The
[12:32.420 --> 12:37.140]  main advantage to using something small like that is it doesn't take as much, of course,
[12:37.140 --> 12:41.140]  it doesn't take as much soil or soilless mix. You don't have to start off with so much soil
[12:41.140 --> 12:45.100]  that you're not going to use right away. Then you don't need as much water and nutrients
[12:45.180 --> 12:50.180]  to water that smaller amount of soilless mix or soil or cocoa, whatever you've chosen.
[12:50.180 --> 12:54.380]  So you don't need as much water. You don't need as much nutrient. Also, you don't run
[12:54.380 --> 12:58.660]  as much risk of drowning the plants on the initial first few waterings. If you've got
[12:58.660 --> 13:02.780]  a new seedling or you've got a new clone, you do run the risk of drowning that bad bitch
[13:02.780 --> 13:07.460]  at the very beginning. They're very sensitive when they just start developing roots. So
[13:07.460 --> 13:12.860]  the main advantage is less water. The second advantage is less space. You don't have to
[13:12.860 --> 13:17.660]  waste a seven, a three or a five gallon pot worth of space for a plant you can fit in
[13:17.660 --> 13:22.100]  a six inch net pot. That is a lot more plants under less lighting. You are becoming more
[13:22.100 --> 13:27.860]  efficient. When it comes to commercial environments or reducing costs in a small home grow, finding
[13:27.860 --> 13:31.960]  ways to become more efficient can really cut a lot of costs. If you really pay attention
[13:31.960 --> 13:36.100]  and think about what you're doing, this is a great way to do it. So we can turn off all
[13:36.100 --> 13:40.940]  those extra T5s and just move all the plants right under this one. We can save some money.
[13:40.940 --> 13:47.340]  So less water, less space. Then when we do up pot, I see explosive growth. I think that
[13:47.340 --> 13:52.300]  the plants really take off when you go from that six inch pot. I go from a six to a three.
[13:52.300 --> 13:56.200]  And if I upgrade from the three, then I go to a seven. And that's usually as big as I
[13:56.200 --> 14:00.700]  go because I stay indoors. So let's talk a little bit about that progression. Most of
[14:00.700 --> 14:05.940]  the time I start in a clone machine or in a clone dome. I will go from the clone machine
[14:05.940 --> 14:10.940]  or the clone dome, usually into a four inch or a six inch net pot. Sometimes I go into
[14:10.940 --> 14:15.500]  a beer cup, just depending on where I'm working. The plants will grow in that beer cup or that
[14:15.500 --> 14:20.700]  net pot until I see that they are getting kind of tight in that container. I will actually
[14:20.700 --> 14:25.220]  pull the plant out of the cup, out of the pot and visually inspect the roots. I want
[14:25.220 --> 14:30.180]  to see thick white spaghetti looking roots. I want them to be fat and filling that container.
[14:30.180 --> 14:34.020]  I want them swirled around the outside of the container. Once I see that container is
[14:34.020 --> 14:38.220]  filled with roots, that is when it is time to up pot to my next container. Depending
[14:38.220 --> 14:42.760]  on the genetics, depending on your environment, sometimes they stay in these cups for two
[14:42.760 --> 14:47.220]  or four weeks, then they will move into their next container and they will stay there for
[14:47.220 --> 14:51.820]  probably two to four weeks before they go into flower. But I'll move from a cup into
[14:51.820 --> 14:56.080]  a three gallon pot most of the time. Those three gallon pots are what I like to flower
[14:56.080 --> 15:01.500]  in a commercial environment. In some situations, perhaps in a personal home grow where I may
[15:01.500 --> 15:06.020]  be breeding and my numbers are limited and I want larger plants, I may use a seven gallon
[15:06.020 --> 15:10.460]  pot at that time. I'll go from the cup to the three gallon pot to the seven gallon pot.
[15:10.460 --> 15:14.500]  And then I will veg for only about a week in that seven gallon pot because the plants
[15:14.500 --> 15:18.100]  are going to take off. I'm about to flip them into flower and I just want them to be able
[15:18.100 --> 15:22.100]  to develop some roots into that new soil and take off. The roots will keep growing for
[15:22.100 --> 15:25.980]  the first couple of weeks of flower. And I feel like I fill that container quite well
[15:25.980 --> 15:30.840]  by the end of the flowering phase. Also, that big seven gallon pot gives me plenty of time
[15:30.840 --> 15:34.840]  between watering. So I'm able to go out of town and go to the Indo Expo for the weekend.
[15:34.840 --> 15:39.360]  I'm able to go see fish for a couple of days by using that seven gallon pot. I can water
[15:39.360 --> 15:44.480]  that Friday morning and it will usually last me until Monday morning's watering without
[15:44.480 --> 15:50.360]  any worries. So in most scenarios, I go from the cloner to the cup, then into a three gallon.
[15:50.360 --> 15:54.920]  In most situations, I flower at that point. Sometimes I'll throw it into a seven, veg
[15:54.920 --> 15:59.920]  for another week or 10 days, flower them out at that point. Then I feel like I really fill
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.600]  that container with a perfect root mass by the time harvest comes.
[16:03.600 --> 16:07.460]  So I told you the reasons why I plant into a smaller container and work my way up. You
[16:07.460 --> 16:13.360]  asked for pros and cons. The pros of starting in a smaller container, I already mentioned,
[16:13.360 --> 16:18.480]  less space, less water. You're more efficient in general. And then you get that explosive
[16:18.480 --> 16:23.360]  growth. The cons are you have to plan. You have to be on a cycle. You have to know when
[16:23.360 --> 16:27.720]  to transplant. It's going to take you more transplant times. You have more opportunity
[16:27.720 --> 16:32.280]  to cause damage to the plant. So let me talk more about some of the things I just said.
[16:32.280 --> 16:36.960]  Cycles. If you are running a perpetual cycle, you are going to have to transplant plants
[16:36.960 --> 16:42.800]  on a regular cycle or you will fall out of your routine. I work in a commercial environment.
[16:42.800 --> 16:48.080]  I've got a crew of guys that I say, hey, we've got to get all of these cups into these pots.
[16:48.080 --> 16:52.240]  But before we get all of these cups into these pots, we've got to move all of these pots
[16:52.240 --> 16:57.520]  to that room. So it all flows in one big move. I've got two or three guys moving plants from
[16:57.560 --> 17:02.680]  the veg area to the flower area. And as they're emptying space, I've got guys getting cups
[17:02.680 --> 17:08.240]  out of the small veg area and moving them into the large veg area. But if that rhythm
[17:08.240 --> 17:13.360]  gets broken, it will throw everything off for a long time. If you've got one plant that
[17:13.360 --> 17:17.200]  takes too long to finish, or if you've got a week where you don't feel good, or if you
[17:17.200 --> 17:22.000]  want to go out of town and you can't transplant on your cycles, your plants will show it in
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.280]  the end. Also, each of those transplants will give you another opportunity to cause
[17:27.280 --> 17:32.480]  stress to your plant. If you're not an experienced gardener and you're not good at potting the
[17:32.480 --> 17:36.440]  plants, you will cause a little bit of stress to them. I am very confident in myself and
[17:36.440 --> 17:40.560]  the guys in the facilities in which I operate. So I know that they can get the plants out
[17:40.560 --> 17:44.180]  of the small pot and get it right into that big pot. And those plants will never show
[17:44.180 --> 17:47.800]  you a sign that they slowed down. Most of the time, the next day, they're like, hey,
[17:47.800 --> 17:51.680]  how's it ever going, bro? Thank you for the new shoes. But if you're a new grower, you're
[17:51.680 --> 17:55.960]  not super experienced. You may have some questions. You may try some new shit. You may make some
[17:55.960 --> 18:00.260]  little mistakes. Who knows what's going to happen in your grow? You do get the opportunity
[18:00.260 --> 18:04.880]  to cause stresses during each transplant. One of the advantages though, you don't have
[18:04.880 --> 18:09.440]  to transplant a bunch of times. I'm transplanting one or two times and that's stressful. And
[18:09.440 --> 18:13.480]  I've got a lot of plants, so it takes a long time. We've got a crew of guys doing it. I
[18:13.480 --> 18:16.160]  could cause a lot of problems to plants if we fuck up.
[18:16.160 --> 18:20.080]  The other advantage is that you already know how much space your plants are going to take.
[18:20.080 --> 18:23.520]  They're in that pot. That's how much room you get. Then you can watch them grow into
[18:23.520 --> 18:27.720]  that. Then you can flower. Like you said in the beginning, you do have to be careful with
[18:27.720 --> 18:31.840]  watering. Just make sure that you don't drown this plant. When we're using smaller containers,
[18:31.840 --> 18:36.640]  the soil or soilless mix has more of an opportunity to dry. So if we do over water, it'll just
[18:36.640 --> 18:39.920]  dry up and the plants will kind of rescue themselves. The roots won't get smothered
[18:39.920 --> 18:44.360]  for too long and will survive. In a bigger pot, it's going to take longer for that stuff
[18:44.360 --> 18:49.160]  at the bottom to dry. So you're going to have a really wet bottom and a dry top. And
[18:49.160 --> 18:53.400]  most of your root growth is going to still be up at the top. The roots are going to dig
[18:53.400 --> 18:56.920]  for the bottom and look for water. They'll probably find it down there at the bottom
[18:56.920 --> 19:00.840]  and try to drink from that. You're really going to have to find the balance to get the
[19:00.840 --> 19:04.480]  top the right level of moisture and the bottom the right level of moisture and get that root
[19:04.480 --> 19:09.160]  growth growing properly. It may be frustrating. It could be a struggle. You're in a five gallon
[19:09.160 --> 19:14.440]  pot. It could be bigger. It could be worse. Just be very careful not to over water and
[19:14.440 --> 19:18.440]  not to drown this plant. I think that pretty much covers it. Let's read more quickly about
[19:18.440 --> 19:22.200]  the grow here. He's got a small space. It's a four by two by five and a half. Make sure
[19:22.200 --> 19:26.360]  you don't veg too long. These plants are going to get tall quickly and you've got a short
[19:26.360 --> 19:30.680]  space. The box is five and a half feet tall. You're probably taking up a little bit of
[19:30.680 --> 19:34.600]  space with the light. I would suggest using a trellis or some sort of a net so you can
[19:34.600 --> 19:38.400]  spread the plants out and keep them low. That way you can fill that space to its maximum
[19:38.400 --> 19:42.560]  potential and get a nice harvest out of there. He's got a good light in this space. It sounds
[19:42.560 --> 19:47.400]  like he's got a good fan. I wonder about the airflow and the air exchange. Are we getting
[19:47.400 --> 19:52.800]  air in and out of there so we don't get stagnant air? We've got a soil pH test, which is okay.
[19:52.800 --> 19:57.400]  I don't worry too much about that. It is a little bit warm in that grow environment.
[19:57.400 --> 20:01.760]  Also, it may be a little bit too humid. When you put the plants in there and start watering,
[20:01.760 --> 20:06.200]  you're going to get more humidity, especially with that much heat. You're going to need
[20:06.240 --> 20:10.000]  to exchange that air. That is something that is going to come up probably a little bit
[20:10.000 --> 20:14.160]  later in the grow as the plants get larger. They'll start working more. They'll need more
[20:14.160 --> 20:18.360]  water. They'll start letting out more water. You're going to run into humidity issues.
[20:18.360 --> 20:22.840]  I would start working on that before it becomes a problem. Don't put yourself in scramble
[20:22.840 --> 20:28.640]  mode. You've got some expensive seeds probably. You've got some expensive gear. You are doing
[20:28.640 --> 20:33.880]  this illegally, so you are putting yourself at risk. Be very careful. Let's get this correct.
[20:33.880 --> 20:37.000]  If you're going to do it, do it right. Get something to reduce that humidity and that
[20:37.000 --> 20:40.760]  temperature now before we get to that stage. All right. I want to thank you for the great
[20:40.760 --> 20:45.320]  email. Good luck down there in Prohibition Land. Be very careful. Don't tell anybody
[20:45.320 --> 20:48.120]  else about your grow, but thank you for the great email.
[20:48.120 --> 20:52.360]  All right. Let's keep going while I've got this good flow going. This next message came
[20:52.360 --> 20:56.600]  from ... Let's see. It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, you can call me Ridge. What up Ridge? Nice
[20:56.600 --> 21:01.480]  to meet you. I am Rasta Jeff. The message says, I am a big fan of your podcast, your
[21:01.480 --> 21:07.400]  content, and your ability to describe a visual image of whatever you are talking about right
[21:07.400 --> 21:12.120]  into my head. Hey, that is cool, man. Thank you, because I do a lot of work trying to
[21:12.120 --> 21:16.600]  describe what I'm talking about in multiple different ways so that everybody can see what
[21:16.600 --> 21:20.760]  I'm trying to say. People learn in different ways. Some people are book learners. Some
[21:20.760 --> 21:24.440]  people are listening learners. Some people are reader learners. Some people actually
[21:24.440 --> 21:28.200]  have to get their hands dirty to figure out what they're doing. I really do make an effort
[21:28.200 --> 21:32.040]  to teach in multiple ways so that I can include everybody and make sure that everybody learns
[21:32.040 --> 21:37.000]  a little something. Thank you for noticing that I'm trying to describe a visual image,
[21:37.000 --> 21:40.840]  and that I'm trying to get it right into your head. Ridge goes on to say, I usually listen
[21:40.840 --> 21:45.720]  on YouTube. You helped me out with the tab timer issue a while back. Hey, I remember you.
[21:45.720 --> 21:50.360]  That's good to hear from you again. The message goes on to say, for your new buddy from France,
[21:50.360 --> 21:53.880]  we had a message from a person in France who had a grow tent, and they were concerned about
[21:53.880 --> 21:59.480]  light leaking in. I recommended some advice to our friend Ridge. I recommended some blackout
[21:59.480 --> 22:04.120]  curtains. He said, those blackout curtains work well for me. I just hang them around the tent,
[22:04.120 --> 22:08.600]  almost like a dressing room around my tent, and the air comes in under the curtains.
[22:08.600 --> 22:13.560]  He goes on to say, I stuck Velcro on the curtain to stick them back out of the way when I work.
[22:13.560 --> 22:19.880]  I hope this helps. Cheers to you and all growers, and a big fuck you to prohibition from your friend
[22:19.880 --> 22:24.520]  Ridge. This is a great idea if you were growing in a grow tent, and you're worried that you may be
[22:24.520 --> 22:28.680]  exposing your plants to light, because a lot of those grow tents are made quite cheaply. They do
[22:28.680 --> 22:33.480]  have very small light leaks in them. Here's a quick tip. If you're growing in a grow tent,
[22:33.480 --> 22:37.160]  go inside that bad dog, and turn off the light, and sit in there for a minute, and see if you
[22:37.160 --> 22:40.680]  were getting any light from the outside environment. If you're getting light in your
[22:40.680 --> 22:45.480]  grow tent, you need to correct that. You need to make some adjustments. Some of those light leaks
[22:45.480 --> 22:50.600]  are correctable just by putting a piece of black tape over them. Unfortunately, many of those tents
[22:50.600 --> 22:55.640]  were made with a shitty mesh that will allow light to penetrate the walls of the tent, and get to
[22:55.640 --> 23:00.280]  your plants, which will interrupt your night cycle. This is where people are trying to find creative
[23:00.280 --> 23:05.640]  solutions to prevent light leaks in their grow tent. This is where some people are hanging blackout
[23:05.640 --> 23:10.520]  curtains around the tent to create a little dressing room for the tent to prevent light leaks.
[23:10.520 --> 23:16.200]  People are using fabric curtains, or some people are using stuff like panda film or poly film to
[23:16.200 --> 23:20.840]  create a little layer of protection between the tent and the outside environment. Now, I don't
[23:20.840 --> 23:24.520]  know where everybody is putting their grow tent. Some people have it in a spare bedroom. Some people
[23:24.520 --> 23:28.760]  have got it in the basement. Some people just have it out in the garage. I'm not sure what you've got
[23:28.760 --> 23:33.000]  set up, but if it is in a room where there is a lot of light, and you were concerned with light
[23:33.000 --> 23:37.240]  getting into the tent, this may be something you could think about. If you are not able to use
[23:37.240 --> 23:42.040]  panda film or some sort of poly film because you need to stay stealth, something like a black sheet
[23:42.040 --> 23:46.840]  right around the tent doesn't make a big difference. It still looks like the black tent, and it still
[23:46.840 --> 23:51.480]  works as a concealment. If you don't want to hang a big privacy curtain around the grow tent, you
[23:51.480 --> 23:55.720]  can just make a little flap on the inside or the outside of the tent, just a little bit of velcro
[23:55.720 --> 24:00.040]  like our friend was talking about here, and a little bit of fabric, and a little bit of creativity.
[24:00.040 --> 24:04.600]  You can solve all of these problems without stressing yourself out. But it mostly depends
[24:04.600 --> 24:08.600]  on the quality of the tent. Are you getting a lot of large light leaks? Are you getting just a couple
[24:08.600 --> 24:13.720]  of small pinholes? Or do we really need to prevent a lot of light from getting in? That is when you
[24:13.720 --> 24:17.480]  make the decision to use a little bit of tape. Can I use a couple of pieces of tape just to stick
[24:17.480 --> 24:21.560]  those over these little pinholes and prevent that light coming in? Can you use a little bit of fabric
[24:21.560 --> 24:25.320]  and make a little velcro curtain? Or do you actually need to make a little privacy curtain
[24:25.320 --> 24:30.440]  around the grow tent and prevent light from getting into your plants? But big shout out to our buddy
[24:30.520 --> 24:35.400]  Ridge here. Our buddy Ridge says that he's using blackout curtains and it works well. Then Ridge
[24:35.400 --> 24:40.040]  was brilliant enough to use that stoner ingenuity. They got some velcro and they put velcro at the
[24:40.040 --> 24:44.280]  top of the tent and at the bottom of that curtain and all they got to do now is just velcro that up
[24:44.280 --> 24:48.600]  there and they've got a little easy access, a little bit of workspace without a lot of work. So
[24:48.600 --> 24:53.480]  use that stoner ingenuity. Don't let little problems stress you out in the grow room. Smoke
[24:53.480 --> 24:57.800]  a fat joint. A little bit of creativity will go a long way. All right, I want to give a big shout
[24:57.800 --> 25:02.520]  out to our buddy Ridge. Thank you for the great email. I'm going to keep going. The next email on
[25:02.520 --> 25:08.920]  today's show goes just like this. Hello, Rasta Jeff. I enjoy the podcast tremendously. I don't
[25:08.920 --> 25:14.680]  think I've missed one since hearing and seeing you on Embracing Organics. Just in case some people
[25:14.680 --> 25:21.720]  don't know, just about every Thursday, I go on the Embracing Organics live podcast on YouTube and I
[25:21.720 --> 25:26.600]  hang out with my friends and we talk about growing cannabis. And then sometimes it gets a little bit
[25:26.600 --> 25:31.560]  weird later in the night. But join us on Thursdays on YouTube. Simply search for the Embracing
[25:31.560 --> 25:38.920]  Organics podcast. We generally try to start the show around 7 or 7.30 PM Mountain Time. So join
[25:38.920 --> 25:44.600]  us for the live show. Search for Embracing Organics on Thursday around 7 PM Mountain Time. Look for
[25:44.600 --> 25:49.880]  the video with the live icon next to it. The red live icon means we are live at that time. Click
[25:49.880 --> 25:55.000]  on that one. Join the chat. You can ask us your cannabis questions and we will try to answer them
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.200]  live on the show. So let's get back to this email. It says, this is by far the best form of
[26:00.200 --> 26:06.600]  learning for me. A big thank you is above well-deserved. You can say my name is Reese.
[26:06.600 --> 26:11.320]  Hey, Reese, thank you for the great compliment. I love hearing that people are learning from our
[26:11.320 --> 26:16.120]  podcasts. If you were listening to the Embracing Organics podcast and you're listening to my show,
[26:16.120 --> 26:22.840]  you are absolutely getting a good, solid cannabis education foundation. If you enjoy my show and if
[26:22.840 --> 26:27.800]  you're enjoying the Embracing Organics show, I think you would also enjoy the Dude Grows show.
[26:27.800 --> 26:32.120]  So if you're not already listening to the Dude Grows show, I would strongly suggest that you
[26:32.120 --> 26:36.920]  give them a subscribe and a listen because you will learn a lot from them as well. Then when
[26:36.920 --> 26:42.440]  you're ready to expand your knowledge, I think you can learn even more from the Cannabis Cultivation
[26:42.440 --> 26:48.440]  and Sciences podcast with Tad Hussey. And I really strongly suggest the Shaping Fire podcast with
[26:48.440 --> 26:54.280]  Shango Lose. So get a good foundation with the Dude Grows, with my show and with Embracing Organics.
[26:54.280 --> 26:57.640]  Then when you're ready to step up a little bit, that's when you want to check out Cannabis
[26:57.640 --> 27:02.920]  Cultivation and Sciences with Tad Hussey. And I would also again suggest Shaping Fire with
[27:02.920 --> 27:08.360]  Shango Lose. Those are two other podcasts that will really expand your cannabis growing knowledge.
[27:08.360 --> 27:12.840]  Now let's jump back into the email. There is more. It says, can you shed some light on why
[27:12.840 --> 27:20.280]  I get purple stems from time to time, then they fade back to green? This is a great question,
[27:20.280 --> 27:25.640]  but without more details, without more info, or maybe some photos, it is going to be hard for me
[27:25.640 --> 27:31.800]  to accurately diagnose what is happening with your plant. Fortunately, what I can say is that a little
[27:31.800 --> 27:37.800]  bit of purple stem is probably not too much of a problem. This could be a couple of things. Again,
[27:37.800 --> 27:42.040]  I don't know what else is happening in your grow. I don't know about your temperatures. I don't know
[27:42.040 --> 27:46.200]  about your humidity. I don't know about your diurnal shifts. I don't know anything about what's
[27:46.200 --> 27:50.280]  going on in that room other than you've got some ganja plants in there and they're getting some
[27:50.280 --> 27:54.600]  purple stems. So with the little information I've got, let's talk about what it could be.
[27:54.600 --> 27:58.440]  This could be temperature related, depending on where this is happening in the plant,
[27:58.440 --> 28:01.960]  what part of the plant. This could be from the plant getting cold. Are you getting cold
[28:01.960 --> 28:07.240]  night temperatures? Are you having warm daytime temps and then lower nighttime temperatures?
[28:07.240 --> 28:13.080]  That can absolutely encourage purple stems. Now by purple stems, do you mean the main stock of the
[28:13.080 --> 28:18.680]  plant? Do you mean the branches or do you mean the petioles, the actual stems of the leaves?
[28:18.680 --> 28:24.440]  If the tops of the petioles are turning purple, maybe a reddish color, that is possibly because
[28:24.440 --> 28:29.640]  they are getting too cold. Now this can also be a nutrient issue. This could be phosphorus or
[28:29.640 --> 28:35.480]  potassium related. But again, since I can't see the plants, since I can't see your PL Grow Monitor
[28:35.480 --> 28:39.560]  information and tell you what's been happening in that grow for the past few weeks, it is hard for
[28:39.560 --> 28:45.400]  me to diagnose the problem. One hint is that you say the plants turn, you get purple stems from
[28:45.400 --> 28:50.920]  time to time and then they fade back to green. In my mind, that makes me think that it is probably a
[28:50.920 --> 28:55.320]  temperature issue. They're getting too cold overnight one time, then they get really purple
[28:55.320 --> 28:59.000]  from that. But over the next few days, they start warming up and they start getting green again and
[28:59.000 --> 29:02.920]  going back to their normal life. Then you're probably getting another cold snap and those
[29:02.920 --> 29:06.840]  plants are getting those purple stems all over again and it's probably freaking you out, which
[29:06.840 --> 29:12.520]  makes sense. This could be nutrients. This could be temperature. This could also simply be something
[29:12.520 --> 29:17.080]  that that plant does. It could be genetics. As that plant grows, it may turn purple at one point
[29:17.080 --> 29:22.520]  and then it also may go right back to green. How experienced are you with that particular plant?
[29:22.520 --> 29:26.600]  Is it one strain that's doing it? Is it one phenotype that's doing it? Or is it the entire
[29:26.600 --> 29:32.680]  garden? Is it one section? Is it one row? Is it one area? Without having more information, it is
[29:32.680 --> 29:37.720]  really hard for me to pinpoint and diagnose the exact problem. I would start by checking on
[29:37.720 --> 29:42.760]  temperature, then I would check out the nutrients, then I would start dialing it in row by row,
[29:42.760 --> 29:47.800]  plant by plant and start eliminating things that it could be and that will show you what it actually
[29:47.800 --> 29:52.600]  is. But that's the best I can do for you with the limited information that I have got. I do want to
[29:52.600 --> 29:57.000]  thank you again for listening to the Embracing Organics show and of course for listening to my
[29:57.000 --> 30:02.680]  show. And of course again, I do encourage you to listen to the Dude Grows podcast. If you want me
[30:02.680 --> 30:07.480]  to follow up with this question, send me some details. What's happening in your grow? Do you
[30:07.480 --> 30:11.800]  know what the nighttime temperatures are? Do you know what the daytime temperatures are? Do you
[30:11.800 --> 30:16.680]  know what the VPD is in the night and day? Do you know what you've been feeding these plants for the
[30:16.680 --> 30:22.600]  past few weeks? Are you in veg? Are you in flower? Are you indoors? Are you outdoors? I would like a
[30:22.600 --> 30:28.120]  lot more information and I may be able to dial in and diagnose the problem if there even is a
[30:28.120 --> 30:32.760]  problem with your plant. The good news is a little bit of purpling might not even be a problem. This
[30:32.760 --> 30:37.160]  could just be genetics. All right, Reese, I want to thank you once again for the great compliment. I
[30:37.160 --> 30:41.400]  want to thank you for the great email and I do look forward to getting some photos and some details
[30:41.400 --> 30:46.200]  about what is happening in your garden so we can help you diagnose and dial in what is happening
[30:46.200 --> 30:51.560]  with your plants. All right, podcast world, that is all I've got for you for episode 473 of the
