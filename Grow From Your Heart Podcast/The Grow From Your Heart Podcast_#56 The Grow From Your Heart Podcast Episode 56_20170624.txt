[00:10.880 --> 00:23.570]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for episode number 56 of the Grow From
[00:23.570 --> 00:28.130]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. If you're
[00:28.130 --> 00:32.650]  a new grower, if you're a pro grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're
[00:32.650 --> 00:36.130]  a cannabis activist, or if you're just someone who's curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.130 --> 00:39.730]  this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host, Rasta Jeff. Thanks again for joining
[00:39.730 --> 00:43.650]  me. As always, before we get started, I have to send a big, huge thank you shout out to
[00:43.650 --> 00:47.650]  Kooten Cat from the Mystic Roots Band. Thanks a lot for letting me use your music. Joining
[00:47.650 --> 00:51.530]  me today again is one of our heroes. Welcome back, dude. We got King Cola to the left.
[00:51.530 --> 00:55.170]  How are you, bro? Good, man. Thanks for having me. Oh, dude. Thanks for coming. We're excited
[00:55.170 --> 01:00.610]  about this. Sean is going to drop some knowledge on you guys today that is going to fuck up
[01:00.610 --> 01:09.230]  your whole thought process on growing. Yeah. So I'm here to give out some information.
[01:09.230 --> 01:13.250]  You can take it or leave it. I'm not just a little bit, but that Mike has a impotency
[01:13.250 --> 01:20.730]  problems that likes to droop after a while. Yeah. So I'm not, my word is not law by any
[01:20.730 --> 01:28.410]  means, but this is just my, how I grow. This is what I have discovered through my personal
[01:28.410 --> 01:39.890]  studies, but I just want to say, stop using molasses in your teas. And yeah, I mean completely.
[01:39.890 --> 01:45.050]  And the main reason is, is a lot of people are using molasses on a regular basis. Typically
[01:45.050 --> 01:50.170]  when you ask somebody what they're using in your compost tea and the same for me, I think
[01:50.170 --> 01:55.170]  probably on the first episode, I probably even recommended certain rates to use molasses
[01:55.170 --> 02:01.810]  at. I think so. You know, so I mean, you just, this is an evolving industry. Everything changes.
[02:01.810 --> 02:08.090]  We learn as we go. But, uh, so I cut my, I heard a while ago, basically you need to quit
[02:08.130 --> 02:12.130]  using, somebody told me you need to quit using molasses. I said, why? And they were, you
[02:12.130 --> 02:16.930]  know, I'll get back to you. And I never heard from him again, but it stuck in my head. So
[02:16.930 --> 02:21.970]  I quit using molasses, just cut it out. And, uh, I didn't see a difference. You know what
[02:21.970 --> 02:27.210]  I mean? It's not like things quit working. So it's not acting like the bud hardener and
[02:27.210 --> 02:30.970]  the sweetener, like we think it is maybe. Yeah. You know, I didn't, I didn't see it.
[02:30.970 --> 02:36.210]  So, uh, I'm doing my thing and then I get back in touch with this person and we kind
[02:36.210 --> 02:41.370]  of discuss it a little more. And you know, a lot of people, like I was saying, for a
[02:41.370 --> 02:46.770]  basic compost tea, what I used to recommend and a lot of people are using are earthworm
[02:46.770 --> 02:53.770]  castings or Alaskan humus or some sort of humic acid. They're using molasses and then
[02:54.370 --> 03:00.330]  they're using like a kelp meal or something. Well, the reason that you use that molasses
[03:00.450 --> 03:06.210]  in the tea is actually not for the reason that you had mentioned early. When you use,
[03:06.210 --> 03:11.770]  excuse me, when you use the molasses in a tea, it's not for, not so much as a bud hardener
[03:11.770 --> 03:17.170]  for the plant. It's not so much a carbohydrate for the plant as it is a food source for the
[03:17.170 --> 03:24.170]  microbes in the tea. Right. In our teas. Okay. And the thing with molasses is it's a simple
[03:24.370 --> 03:30.250]  carbohydrate and simple carbohydrates feed simple organisms. And that's the simplest
[03:30.250 --> 03:36.610]  way to say it. So molasses is an extremely strong bacteria food. Uh, you've probably
[03:36.610 --> 03:41.770]  heard before that marijuana is a fungal dominant plant. They like fungal dominant teas, especially
[03:41.770 --> 03:48.770]  in flower. Uh, so by using molasses, you're going to be encouraging bacterial growth.
[03:49.010 --> 03:56.010]  Well, the molasses not only feeds the bacteria, but it feeds it in an enormous rate. Bacteria
[03:58.770 --> 04:04.010]  is naturally occurring. It's everywhere. It's already in the soil. It's on our skin. It's
[04:04.010 --> 04:08.610]  everywhere and in between. So it's already going to be there in your tea. It's going
[04:08.610 --> 04:12.730]  to be in your water. It's going to be in your soil. You know, probably some of it's already
[04:12.730 --> 04:19.490]  going to be a molasses. So there's plenty of bacteria out there. As you add this molasses,
[04:19.490 --> 04:26.490]  you start to feed this bacteria and the bacteria starts to eat the food and they start to digest.
[04:26.570 --> 04:33.450]  And what happens is the growth of the bacteria happens too fast and the organisms, uh, will
[04:33.450 --> 04:38.130]  actually use up all of the available food and oxygen resources. So you actually drop
[04:38.130 --> 04:44.810]  the dissolved oxygen levels in your tea. So putting molasses in your AAC tea will take
[04:44.810 --> 04:49.250]  out one of those A's. It will make it go anaerobic and you will no longer be having an aerated
[04:49.250 --> 04:54.530]  compost tea despite you having bubblers running. Um, you'll still, you're still going to take
[04:54.530 --> 04:59.110]  out the oxygen. You'll lower the dissolved oxygen levels. Then you're just harvesting
[04:59.110 --> 05:03.690]  anaerobic bacteria. Basically killing off everything we're working to create. Exactly.
[05:03.690 --> 05:08.970]  Adding the thing that we thought was fueling our fire. Exactly. Okay. By adding molasses,
[05:08.970 --> 05:14.170]  you're just taking out everything that you just put all of your money and time into.
[05:14.170 --> 05:19.850]  You're just growing the bacteria at a phenomenal rate. They're out competing everything else.
[05:19.850 --> 05:25.730]  And that's eventually what you put on your plant. I just Googled fungal dominance. Um,
[05:25.730 --> 05:28.810]  we can do an entire episode on that just by what I'm reading. Yes. You guys are going
[05:28.810 --> 05:32.130]  to have to go. If you want to catch up, Google fungal dominance. I can't even begin to explain
[05:32.130 --> 05:36.730]  it. There is so much going on in fungal dominance. Wow. That'll change your thinking, but right
[05:36.730 --> 05:43.450]  there. Yeah, yeah, definitely. So, uh, with the teas, like I was saying, so when you add
[05:43.450 --> 05:49.690]  the molasses, it can drop the dissolved oxygen levels for anybody who's listening, who wants
[05:49.690 --> 05:55.710]  to know specifically above eight parts per million of dissolved oxygen is where you want
[05:55.710 --> 06:01.250]  your teas. That's when you're brewing aerobic organisms between six parts per million and
[06:01.370 --> 06:06.730]  eight parts per million. You are facilitating anaerobic zones. These organisms outcompete
[06:06.730 --> 06:12.850]  the aerobic organisms at a rate of two to one. These facilitate anaerobic zones. Uh,
[06:12.850 --> 06:17.930]  this is where some really nasty things live. Uh, these things are in your compost. You
[06:17.930 --> 06:24.170]  were like these bad organisms are in your compost, such as, you know, really anaerobic
[06:24.170 --> 06:30.210]  or E. coli or these other things, just nasties. Uh, they're going to multiply at an alarming
[06:30.250 --> 06:35.570]  rate. Once you start creating this anaerobic environment. And if you use that as a full
[06:35.570 --> 06:39.610]  year spray, you just sprayed E. coli under your plants, right? Yeah. And that's the thing
[06:39.610 --> 06:43.910]  is they actually like when you, your tea starts to do that, the organisms are produce acids
[06:43.910 --> 06:48.450]  that kill anaerobic organisms and high enough qualities. These acids can stress and kill
[06:48.450 --> 06:55.450]  your plant, you know, in no growing environment anywhere. Is there a shortage of bacteria?
[06:55.690 --> 07:02.490]  So, uh, there's no need to just feed more of them and stress your plants out. And, uh,
[07:02.490 --> 07:08.930]  there's other options instead of molasses. So right off the bat, just cut it out. So
[07:08.930 --> 07:15.930]  if you want to do a tea, what I would recommend to would be, uh, actually here in one second,
[07:16.330 --> 07:23.050]  but yeah. So if you're going to start a tea, uh, I would just go with worm castings. I
[07:23.050 --> 07:30.050]  would go with a kelp meal and that's just about it. Castings and kelp meal. Yeah. I'm
[07:32.090 --> 07:35.170]  sorry. I'm trying to, I've got everything written up. So yeah, there you go. He's got
[07:35.170 --> 07:38.530]  his, he's got a whole computer in front of them. You guys. So I tried to come prepared.
[07:38.530 --> 07:41.370]  He came well prepared. I kind of peeked at his notes a minute ago. He's got a lot of
[07:41.370 --> 07:46.250]  info. Yeah. So we've got a, so basically for, for a really basic compost tea, I'm going
[07:46.250 --> 07:53.250]  to roll with Dr. Elaine Ingram's compost tea. So her teas are basically compost or,
[07:53.250 --> 08:00.250]  you know, worm castings or whatever you can source, uh, kelp meal. And then you can add
[08:01.410 --> 08:07.410]  in, uh, instead of molasses, you can add in a humic source. So you can add in like a humic
[08:07.410 --> 08:12.330]  acid derived from Pete, like a dragon flyer with medicines, brilliant black. Uh, there's
[08:12.530 --> 08:16.770]  a lot of recommend actually. Yeah. There's a lot of different options out there, but
[08:16.770 --> 08:22.410]  you can add in a humic acid or, or in that place you could add in a fish hydro slate.
[08:22.410 --> 08:29.410]  So for your base teas, every time I would just go with worm castings and water outside
[08:29.490 --> 08:34.130]  of that, you can add in kelp meal or alfalfa meal or anything like that specific to your
[08:34.130 --> 08:39.330]  stage, uh, your plant stage in life. And then if you want to start adding foods for the
[08:39.330 --> 08:46.050]  fungi, basically if you're in veg, fish hydro slate. So for vegetative growth, instead of
[08:46.050 --> 08:52.610]  using molasses, replace it with fish hydro slate. Now fish hydro slate, it can, it can
[08:52.610 --> 08:58.210]  go the same way as molasses. It can turn your tea anaerobic really fast. And I know you're
[08:58.210 --> 09:02.250]  probably thinking anaerobic. Well, you know, you, I've personally talked about anaerobic
[09:02.250 --> 09:07.210]  teas and Bukashi and all of these things, which is, you know, they're actually anaerobic
[09:07.250 --> 09:12.130]  fermentations and anaerobic, anaerobic compost. That's completely different. That's because
[09:12.130 --> 09:19.130]  we want anaerobic environments. We don't want anaerobic bacteria in our aerobic teas, you
[09:19.330 --> 09:22.530]  know? So they're separate but equal.
[09:22.530 --> 09:25.330]  Yeah. We're making a tea and then feeding that to our...
[09:25.330 --> 09:30.050]  Exactly. You don't, yeah. You know, so when you're fermenting, don't let oxygen get into
[09:30.050 --> 09:33.010]  it. And when you're aerating, don't let it go stagnant.
[09:33.010 --> 09:36.370]  Write that down you guys.
[09:36.370 --> 09:42.970]  So as far as food for your teas, like I was saying, if you need to improve your fungal
[09:42.970 --> 09:48.530]  count, which everybody wants to, everybody wants fungal dominant teas, you can add a
[09:48.530 --> 09:55.530]  steel cut oat bran or steel cut oats, bran powder, shrimp shells. I mean, there's any
[09:56.130 --> 09:59.770]  sort of really any sort of like high protein.
[09:59.770 --> 10:01.450]  We can just pick that up at the health food store, right?
[10:01.450 --> 10:04.490]  You can pick all of that up at the health food store. Actually, there's a lot of like,
[10:05.010 --> 10:10.370]  I've seen a lot of stuff on people are people are starting to consume like fish hydroslate
[10:10.370 --> 10:15.890]  and stuff, which I don't know if I'm there yet, but I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if
[10:15.890 --> 10:18.010]  you can pick that up at the health food store soon.
[10:18.010 --> 10:19.490]  Eventually, right?
[10:19.490 --> 10:26.490]  But yeah, so just molasses, I mean, take it how you want it, you know, take it or leave
[10:27.490 --> 10:34.490]  it. I recommend cutting it out. I think I've learned from very reputable sources and you
[10:36.330 --> 10:43.330]  know, they're, these aren't people just, you know, talking, you know, shit. These are real
[10:43.930 --> 10:48.810]  scientists. These guys are sitting there in front of their microscopes and they're straining
[10:48.810 --> 10:51.370]  their minds and their eyes. So we don't have to,
[10:51.370 --> 10:55.090]  No, I don't think you need to try to give yourself any sort of credit or your sources.
[10:55.090 --> 10:58.130]  You've been on here enough and I think people have realized that you are definitely not
[10:58.130 --> 11:01.730]  full of shit. I think you've earned your credit here. I'm going to give it to you.
[11:01.730 --> 11:02.530]  Well, thank you.
[11:02.530 --> 11:05.850]  We respect your opinion. I respect your opinion. Well, thank you. I've been at this for years
[11:05.850 --> 11:07.770]  and you teach me stuff every time you come.
[11:07.770 --> 11:13.170]  Well, I really appreciate it. And uh, but yeah, so I mean just cut the, cut the molasses
[11:13.170 --> 11:18.370]  out of your teas. I used to use it every fucking day. I mean like every time.
[11:18.370 --> 11:21.930]  My last batch of tea and you know what? I didn't see much of a difference. I used, I
[11:22.050 --> 11:26.850]  used to use your recommendation or the Rebs recommendation of molasses in my tea and I
[11:26.850 --> 11:31.250]  made a tea just a few days ago with some, uh, Bokashi bucket leachate in there and I
[11:31.250 --> 11:35.730]  actually got way more foam without the molasses on that bucket than I've ever made.
[11:35.730 --> 11:38.690]  That's the best tea I've ever made was my most recent without the molasses.
[11:38.690 --> 11:43.490]  Yeah. I mean, and the plants love it. You're going to get way better results using a
[11:43.490 --> 11:49.330]  beneficial microorganisms, using things like a cold process, fish hydro slate, like the
[11:49.330 --> 11:53.770]  Brown's fish hydro slate you grabbed from Rocky Mount worm company, uh, or you can
[11:53.770 --> 11:58.690]  make your own fish hydro slate. But, uh, those food sources work way better. They're
[11:58.690 --> 12:00.290]  way more natural. Um,
[12:01.290 --> 12:05.410]  it's just like us. If we eat natural food, our body absorbs it much more naturally
[12:05.490 --> 12:08.450]  instead of trying to go to McDonald's or whatever, exactly. Pull out the nutrients
[12:08.450 --> 12:11.450]  and poop out the crap. Instead you're able to absorb what you're eating. It's like,
[12:11.450 --> 12:15.570]  it should be. It's like eating a pop tart or an apple. Yeah. I mean it's, you know,
[12:15.570 --> 12:22.570]  how does your body run off of it? But, uh, yeah, the, so for teas, just keep it simpler.
[12:23.450 --> 12:29.810]  The better, you know, just run your castings run, you know, your kelp. If you want to add
[12:29.810 --> 12:36.450]  a food source, you can. I like, I really like fish hydro slate during veg. You see tremendous
[12:36.450 --> 12:40.170]  vegetative growth and then that's how you really step away from bottled nutrients. You
[12:40.170 --> 12:44.570]  know, that way if you are using bottled nutrients, the only one you're using is the fish product.
[12:45.570 --> 12:50.890]  What are we using? Sorry to cut you off. What are we using to feed the tea in bloom? You
[12:50.890 --> 12:52.290]  keep saying fish, hydroslate and veg.
[12:52.290 --> 12:57.450]  So for if you're going to feed your tea in bloom, uh, uh, soft rock phosphate. There
[12:57.450 --> 13:02.690]  we go. Yeah. That's a lot in your OGT. So soft rock phosphate, but that goes right back
[13:02.690 --> 13:07.090]  into you need to know what you're using, how much you're using, where you're sourcing it
[13:07.090 --> 13:12.690]  from. You go and you dump astronomical amount of soft rock phosphate on your plant. You're
[13:12.730 --> 13:17.370]  going to, you know, like I said, that goes right back to you can be organic and you can
[13:17.370 --> 13:19.930]  be worse than all your synthetic buddies out there.
[13:19.930 --> 13:24.850]  Right. I actually, uh, I think I overused some OGT because I wasn't, I was thinking,
[13:24.850 --> 13:27.770]  Oh, it's OGT. Let's fuck it up. So I fed it instead of every two weeks, I was doing it
[13:27.770 --> 13:32.090]  every week because I wasn't paying attention. And I think the plant sped up too much, like
[13:32.090 --> 13:35.130]  you said, cause they were burned. They were showing nitrogen deficiencies in like week
[13:35.130 --> 13:37.690]  five. And I think they're just going too fast.
[13:37.690 --> 13:42.450]  This is more from like the, the trichoderma like strains that they have in there, but
[13:42.450 --> 13:47.730]  he has soft rock phosphate also in there, which works as a food for the microbes and
[13:47.730 --> 13:53.410]  a to fungal food, but you can also get your phosphates obviously from introducing that
[13:53.410 --> 13:59.490]  into the tea. So it's a great, that's a great source of, uh, if you need a bloom tea for
[13:59.490 --> 14:03.490]  say, theoretically, you should have all of that amended in your soil. Um, and it'll just
[14:03.490 --> 14:09.170]  kind of take up what it wants, um, which kind of rolls into what we were originally.
[14:09.170 --> 14:12.730]  That was our, um, our original idea today was to talk about building a little bit of
[14:12.730 --> 14:17.230]  soil. So I believe you, I like your guys, the molasses is unnecessary. Those are old
[14:17.230 --> 14:22.650]  school farmer tricks. We were taught that, uh, try it yourself, make a, do a test run,
[14:22.650 --> 14:27.010]  set one set of plants on one side of the room, one set on the other, add molasses to one
[14:27.010 --> 14:31.010]  set of tea or however you're feeding, add molasses, don't add molasses to the other,
[14:31.010 --> 14:34.970]  you'll see the difference for yourself. It's, uh, you're not going to see enough difference
[14:34.970 --> 14:39.330]  to like break the bank or anything. So give it a try. Yeah. And I mean, keep your molasses
[14:39.330 --> 14:44.450]  around. I use it for plenty of stuff. Uh, FPJs, a lot of the fermented plant juice.
[14:44.450 --> 14:49.170]  Yeah. A lot of the Korean farming techniques that I do, a lot of the homemade fertilizers,
[14:49.170 --> 14:54.810]  I use molasses. And like I said, if you're going to use it for, uh, your sweetener purposes
[14:54.810 --> 14:59.610]  or your hardener purposes or your foliar sprays, or if you use it for stuff, but don't use
[14:59.610 --> 15:05.050]  it for the teas food source and don't use it every time. Don't use it for your teas
[15:05.050 --> 15:09.010]  food source guys. We're over, we're like over amping the tea. Basically we're making hyper
[15:09.010 --> 15:13.410]  little tea. It's all bacteria, little kids, just like sugar. Yeah. They're out competing
[15:13.410 --> 15:19.130]  everybody. Yeah. All right. So yeah, for soil mixes, uh, I really didn't even know where
[15:19.130 --> 15:25.570]  to start for this one. I know that everybody has their own mix. Everybody has their way
[15:25.570 --> 15:32.570]  of doing things. There's super soils and there's layers and there's no till. There's
[15:32.770 --> 15:37.250]  a million ways to do everything. So I just, I figured maybe the best way to go about it
[15:37.250 --> 15:42.330]  would be to kind of just discuss, uh, you know, what, what they are. So, uh, okay. That
[15:42.330 --> 15:49.330]  sounds great. Yeah. So, um, a super soil, uh, super soils are a term for a nutrient
[15:49.650 --> 15:56.650]  charged soil. Uh, sub cool is the father of super soils. Yeah. So cool. Made it really
[15:57.930 --> 16:04.930]  famous. And basically the idea is you're going to create this nutrient rich mixture of soil
[16:05.570 --> 16:10.090]  and you're going to layer the bottom of your pot with it. And then you're going to plant
[16:10.090 --> 16:16.090]  your plant actually into a, uh, less hot medium. Like, so you would use a bag soil and you
[16:16.210 --> 16:21.130]  would take your five gallon container and you'd fill the bottom so many inches up with
[16:21.130 --> 16:27.490]  your super soil mix and then add in your bag soil and then actually transplant your plan
[16:27.490 --> 16:33.830]  into it. Theoretically you water your plant, the roots grow through the bag soil medium
[16:33.830 --> 16:39.310]  into the super soil. And then you never have to fertilize your plant. You can just always
[16:39.310 --> 16:42.930]  feed a water, you know, every time everything's already mixed. Everything's already mixed
[16:42.930 --> 16:49.930]  in the soil. Um, so that's one method of, uh, mixing. Uh, another method for a lot of
[16:52.930 --> 16:59.250]  people is, uh, just like a complete through and through mix. So like a dragon fly earth
[16:59.250 --> 17:06.250]  medicine just does a really, really awesome mix where they do. It's similar to the super
[17:06.250 --> 17:11.450]  soil, but it's actually incorporated throughout the entire mix. So you don't like stir the
[17:11.450 --> 17:16.330]  whole thing. Exactly. So there is no like layering and you don't pad it with, you know,
[17:16.330 --> 17:21.610]  other soil. What they'll do is they, they make their soil and then they do what's a
[17:21.610 --> 17:26.810]  term called cooking, which is just composting. So they let their soil sit for a couple of
[17:26.810 --> 17:32.290]  weeks or a month, you know, the longer the better. And by doing that you can really encourage
[17:32.290 --> 17:35.970]  natural processes. And if you go to dragon fly earth medicines feed, they've got some
[17:35.970 --> 17:40.770]  really cool things about how they'll, you know, you know, the soil that's cooking, they'll
[17:40.770 --> 17:46.170]  treat with a Bukashi and lactic acid bacteria and they pour all their excess compost teas
[17:46.170 --> 17:51.210]  on it. And you can do these things too while your soil cooks. But, uh, they do like really
[17:51.210 --> 17:57.650]  it's more of a botanical mixture. Uh, they use like a kelp meal, alfalfa, nettle. Um,
[17:57.650 --> 18:00.770]  you can go to their website, to their feeds and kind of find out. I don't want to give
[18:00.770 --> 18:04.250]  away all there. Yeah. Go check them out. Definitely. But they've got some check out dragon fly
[18:04.250 --> 18:07.450]  earth medicine. We'll get them on the show one day. Uh, they're in Canada. They said
[18:07.450 --> 18:10.570]  they were going to come here and then they had to go back to Canada or Washington. They're
[18:10.570 --> 18:14.490]  right by Canada. Yeah. They had to skip out on the Pacific Northwest. They're just holding
[18:14.490 --> 18:19.250]  it down up there. Actually they're in a Europe right now. Or if they went to like Prague
[18:19.250 --> 18:23.130]  or they went all over these Istanbul, they're going everywhere. Cause when they come back,
[18:23.130 --> 18:25.730]  they're going to do an interview with me and they're going to tell me about all the things
[18:25.730 --> 18:29.890]  they've seen around the world. So that'll be great. Yeah. But they've been protecting
[18:29.890 --> 18:35.810]  the soil mix for a while. And you know, I mentioned them cause they do like a completely
[18:35.810 --> 18:40.850]  botanical base. You know, everything's plant based with their mixes. I know a lot of other
[18:40.850 --> 18:46.690]  people are traditionally doing, especially like with, uh, the Rev and some other people,
[18:46.690 --> 18:53.690]  um, moonshine man. And there's a lot of other mixes out there, which are all a bone meal,
[18:53.690 --> 18:59.990]  blood meal, phosphates. It's real similar to sub cools mix, but it's the same idea that
[18:59.990 --> 19:04.250]  you mix it throughout the whole batch and you let it cook for a period of time and then
[19:04.250 --> 19:08.850]  you grow into it. And we got to get away from the blood meal and the bone meal. Yeah.
[19:08.850 --> 19:15.850]  There's a alternative to mean, you know, bone meal, a soft rock phosphate, calm, free metal,
[19:15.850 --> 19:22.850]  yarrow, fish bone meal. There's other options. Blood meal, uh, which is your nitrogen source.
[19:22.850 --> 19:27.850]  Uh, yeah, there's, I don't even need to like get into, there's so many other nitrogens,
[19:27.850 --> 19:33.650]  alfalfa, uh, yeah, there's, there's so many other nitrogen sources. I don't even need
[19:33.650 --> 19:39.050]  to cover that. But, uh, I mean, you definitely source where your products are coming from.
[19:39.050 --> 19:49.050]  Uh, me personally, uh, I go with a very simple mix. Uh, I use typically I like to mix my
[19:49.050 --> 19:57.130]  own soil base. Uh, the best mixture I've ever used personally was, um, it's a product called
[19:57.130 --> 20:04.930]  Malibu compost. It's a biodynamic compost blend. Uh, it's fucking awesome. It's only
[20:04.930 --> 20:08.930]  available in California. It's really hard to get here. I was fortunate enough to come
[20:08.930 --> 20:13.730]  across a couple of bags and, uh, it was probably some of the best product they use, but it's
[20:13.730 --> 20:18.130]  a compost. It's not a soil mix. Who's in California that can send us a couple of bags of that.
[20:18.130 --> 20:22.130]  Somebody hook me up, please. Yeah, we need that Malibu compost. I'll give you my PO box
[20:22.130 --> 20:25.730]  number. Just took me up. Yeah, but it's a biodynamic blend. So they have like yarrow
[20:25.730 --> 20:31.730]  and nettle and dandelions and all sorts of cool stuff mixed in there. But, uh, so I used,
[20:31.730 --> 20:37.330]  uh, so I'll use a compost and then cut it in with perlite. I'm not, I'm sorry, not perlite.
[20:37.330 --> 20:42.930]  I use a compost and then I cut it in with a worm casting. Uh, so I make my own like
[20:42.930 --> 20:50.730]  vermicompost. So I'll use the, yeah, the Malibu's compost, Rocky Mount worm castings, and then
[20:50.730 --> 20:57.730]  I'll add in an aerator, which is typically a lot of people use perlite. I don't like
[20:57.730 --> 21:04.730]  perlite so much. So I use a diatomite because I've got a huge bag of it. I've had for like
[21:04.730 --> 21:10.130]  years. I'm still working through it, but you can use like pumice or lava rock. I like to
[21:10.130 --> 21:17.130]  recommend people use things that don't go away as fast. You know, uh, perlite floats
[21:17.130 --> 21:22.530]  to the top and it grinds up really fine and it just kind of goes away to nothing. But
[21:22.530 --> 21:28.730]  uh, I always recommend people to do like a 50% like lava rock or pumice or diatomite,
[21:28.730 --> 21:32.530]  something that doesn't break down as quick and then do another 50, like the other half
[21:32.530 --> 21:38.130]  do like a rice hole or buckwheat hole or some, you know, more of a carbon based aerator.
[21:38.130 --> 21:44.970]  All right. Uh, so yeah, we put in our aerator and then after your compost and your aerator,
[21:44.970 --> 21:48.770]  then you make the decision of whether or not you're going to want to use cocoa core
[21:48.770 --> 21:55.770]  or peat moss. I like peat moss, but I like the environment too. And so you kind of got
[21:55.770 --> 21:59.770]  it. It all comes from like one swamp in Canada or something. You know, so you got it. Like
[21:59.770 --> 22:04.370]  I said, organics, it seems like it's always awesome, but it's not always the best. You
[22:04.370 --> 22:08.970]  just kind of got to pick what you want. I've actually found best result. I like a mixture
[22:08.970 --> 22:13.730]  of cocoa and peat moss. There's something about the oils that come from the cocoa fiber
[22:13.730 --> 22:18.730]  that the plant really likes. Yeah. I've really like a mix of, uh, I've been playing around
[22:18.730 --> 22:30.530]  with different ratios, uh, 50, 50, 75, 25, uh, of cocoa to peat moss, but I kind of like
[22:30.530 --> 22:35.830]  a half and half mixture with it. And then, uh, outside of that, we'll go in and then
[22:35.830 --> 22:42.130]  add a kelp meal, crustacean, neem, oyster shell powder, glacial rock dust, ginseng.
[22:42.330 --> 22:47.530]  Uh, if we really want to get into it, we'll add, you know, biochar and Bukashi and a lot
[22:47.530 --> 22:52.130]  of other natural farming inputs. But that's personally for like my home growth. I can
[22:52.130 --> 22:58.010]  get into it with that stuff, but you guys can too. Uh, listen to this episode, hit pause
[22:58.010 --> 23:01.610]  and rewind all that stuff and listen back and make a list. And if you can't afford to
[23:01.610 --> 23:06.530]  buy a bunch of shit by the first two and the next time by the, by three of them, and then
[23:06.530 --> 23:10.110]  you'll make a better soil every, every time. And we'll start, you'll start seeing good.
[23:10.110 --> 23:11.550]  You should get great results right off the bat.
[23:11.550 --> 23:15.310]  And I tell you, if you, if you think, if you, if you play it back and you think it's too
[23:15.310 --> 23:20.350]  overwhelming, I tell you what, I do work with the dispensaries a lot. You know, I run a
[23:20.350 --> 23:25.230]  consultation company. So if any of you guys out there know anybody who, I hate the word
[23:25.230 --> 23:29.590]  con, I hate saying I'm like do consultations. But, uh, if anybody out there wants to switch,
[23:29.590 --> 23:33.830]  you know, any facilities that want to switch, we're all licensed over here, natural farming.
[23:33.830 --> 23:37.710]  And you know, we've got our cards, we can go in and help your favorite grow, convert
[23:37.710 --> 23:42.950]  the organics. But I work with a couple of different shops and they always seem a little
[23:42.950 --> 23:47.790]  overwhelmed when I come in there and I started running my mouth about mixing soils and you're
[23:47.790 --> 23:52.310]  going to get this and this and this and you're going to mix it together. And it's overwhelming.
[23:52.310 --> 23:55.710]  They like the, when you can walk in there and you can be like, yep, buy a pallet of
[23:55.710 --> 24:01.090]  this and I want a pallet of that. So, uh, I've actually got a mixture for everybody
[24:01.090 --> 24:05.350]  out there who wants to go and just buy a pallet of soil or you want to go buy a Baylor Pro
[24:05.430 --> 24:12.430]  mix or some sunshine for it. So just go and grab your, uh, sunshine for your pro mix.
[24:12.590 --> 24:19.590]  I recommend cutting in worm castings, 10% for your microbial source. Uh, then I would
[24:19.590 --> 24:23.670]  just add, and depending on what you're going with. So if you go with like a sunshine for
[24:23.670 --> 24:28.790]  advanced, they've got like a nutrient starter pack, which is, I think, uh, there's some
[24:28.790 --> 24:33.670]  like minerals in there, other things like that. Yeah. And, uh, that one's a really good
[24:33.710 --> 24:40.630]  one to go with. And then just add in your worm castings, kelp meal, neem, uh, neem
[24:40.630 --> 24:46.510]  cake and crustacean milk or oyster shell powder. Just kind of dependent on how you want to
[24:46.510 --> 24:51.750]  grow personally. But that's it. That's, that's a good start right there. And, uh, I've, I've
[24:51.750 --> 24:56.990]  tried them out. Like right now, if you go to the king underscore Cola feed on Instagram,
[24:56.990 --> 25:02.910]  you can look at the, uh, there's pictures of worms just all over the containers, you
[25:02.910 --> 25:09.270]  know, top soils move in and that's actually all done in sunshine for with kelp neem crustacean
[25:09.270 --> 25:13.470]  and oyster shell powder. Nice. Uh, really simple. I mean, I feel like I'm getting some
[25:13.470 --> 25:20.190]  of the best results that I've ever had with this super the, between this mix and then
[25:20.190 --> 25:24.150]  the mix I had mentioned earlier with Malibu compost are probably the two best results
[25:24.150 --> 25:30.110]  I've gotten since I've started. Um, you know, it's so hard to source a solid like place
[25:30.110 --> 25:37.110]  to get compost. So if you can't do that and you can't make your own compost, I mean, there's
[25:37.310 --> 25:42.390]  no shame in going and buying a bag of soil. You know what I mean? Like everybody, I don't
[25:42.390 --> 25:47.190]  know. I always start a Bokashi bucket. That's a great way to make some over the past three
[25:47.190 --> 25:50.390]  or four weeks. I don't know how long I've been talking about the Bokashi bucket, but
[25:50.390 --> 25:56.910]  I see it turning into funk inside that bucket and I will have, uh, that's a five gallon
[25:56.910 --> 26:01.190]  bucket. Essentially I'll have five gallons of compost to add to a whole bunch of dirt
[26:01.190 --> 26:05.630]  and then a month or two I will have my own amazing compost started from that. Exactly.
[26:05.630 --> 26:12.630]  And I mean even like even buying soil from the store using the nicest castings that money
[26:13.870 --> 26:20.870]  can buy like a Rocky mile worm castings and uh, it's still crazy. And then after amending
[26:21.170 --> 26:24.870]  the soil, soil, it's amazing how cheap this stuff comes out. I'm not going to say the
[26:24.870 --> 26:31.870]  name of this shop that I'm working for, but I will say that they're running 488 20 gallons
[26:32.270 --> 26:39.270]  and we priced them out at $1 20 per gallon of soil. Wow. That's amazing. So suck on that
[26:39.470 --> 26:46.350]  one. Synthetics. There you go guys. And that's for a dispensary. So they have to rely on
[26:46.350 --> 26:49.910]  quality products. I'm going to do a quick commercial. I hate to sneak into commercial,
[26:49.910 --> 26:53.510]  but I have to do them and this is a great time. Uh, because a lot of what we're talking
[26:53.510 --> 26:57.150]  about, the organic portion, this portions, I'm going to try this commercial again. The
[26:57.150 --> 27:01.190]  organic portions of this episode were sponsored by my friends at the Rocky mountain worm company.
[27:01.190 --> 27:05.430]  Visit the Rocky mountain worm company in Colorado Springs for fresh worm castings, African night
[27:05.430 --> 27:08.990]  crawlers, red wigglers, and all of your soil amendments. The Rocky mountain worm company
[27:08.990 --> 27:12.550]  has dragonfly earth medicine products in stock right now. We've been talking about that a
[27:12.550 --> 27:16.630]  lot. Uh, they have the fish hydro slates there. Uh, they've got brilliant black humic from
[27:16.630 --> 27:20.670]  dragonfly earth medicine. Uh, they have a lot of the stuff we talked about. You can
[27:20.670 --> 27:24.630]  grab right there at the Rocky mountain worm company. So go in there that you can actually
[27:24.630 --> 27:27.030]  get their products. If you're listening far away, you can get their product shipped to
[27:27.030 --> 27:30.630]  your door. You can get the same worm casting Sean and I use in our gardens. Many of the
[27:30.630 --> 27:36.270]  same amendments. Check out www.rockymountainwormcompany.com or if you're in Colorado Springs, Denver or
[27:36.270 --> 27:40.750]  Pueblo drive to four 11 Tijuana street in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and make sure
[27:40.750 --> 27:44.350]  you tell them you heard that about them on the grow from your heart podcast. That'd be
[27:44.350 --> 27:47.510]  really cool. I'm going to do another two more quick ads just cause I have to get them done.
[27:47.510 --> 27:50.470]  These guys pay for this and I feel bad if I don't do them. I hate cutting off Sean.

[29:18.030 --> 29:21.830]  soil or do you want to talk about something different? Um, no, I think that that's a,
[29:21.830 --> 29:26.110]  this is a good point to go back to high grow. Uh, I do want to mention, cause I feel like
[29:26.110 --> 29:31.230]  we've been taught. I don't want to snub your other people. We're talking about, uh, no,
[29:31.230 --> 29:35.270]  I mean, cause I was telling people to go and grab soil mix, you know, go. Yeah. Yeah. I
[29:35.270 --> 29:41.310]  want to, we'll work with Jesse a little bit and we'll try to get, uh, we'll call it a
[29:41.310 --> 29:44.710]  Rocky mountain natural farming mix up there for you at the store. Cause I mean, they already
[29:44.710 --> 29:48.070]  carry in the soil. They've already got the castings up there. They've got grow Kashi
[29:48.070 --> 29:53.990]  up there. Yeah. Um, yeah. You talk to Jesse, we can get you fixed with the Rocky mountain
[29:53.990 --> 30:01.070]  natural farming mix, which is like I said, it's, I mean, pro mix sunshine for kelp crustacean
[30:01.070 --> 30:06.230]  mean get to rocking. We'll try to get, Hey guys at hydro. Here's my idea. I want you
[30:06.230 --> 30:10.910]  to set up one little section, just a shelf that we can just walk right there and get
[30:10.910 --> 30:16.270]  this stuff. Like it'll be the grow from your heart. Uh, Rocky mountain worm castings, hygro
[30:16.270 --> 30:19.790]  indoor growing supplies, little bonus section, and just go right there. There'll be some
[30:19.790 --> 30:24.270]  grow Kashi there. We'll do the same thing up at the shop for you too. That'd be so awesome.
[30:24.270 --> 30:27.910]  Let's do this guys. That's my proposal to you guys. I'd appreciate it. So go, if you
[30:27.910 --> 30:32.990]  can't, if you can't source compost and all of that jazz, then go to your local hydro
[30:32.990 --> 30:39.470]  store hygro and grab you a bag soil, get you some basic amendments. And the, the trick
[30:39.470 --> 30:45.950]  is, is to figure out what works for you. Um, I don't like this, like one size fits all
[30:45.950 --> 30:51.390]  idea of growing. Um, cause it doesn't, you know, I mean you probably water completely
[30:51.390 --> 30:56.870]  different. I bet. I bet completely differently. If I used your soil mixing methods, I would
[30:56.870 --> 31:02.630]  probably slaughter those plants. I guarantee I'd kill every single one of them. Um, and
[31:02.630 --> 31:06.430]  then you do the same thing in my style. Does that mean that you're a better grower than
[31:06.430 --> 31:11.070]  me or vice versa? No, it doesn't. Exactly. It's just a matter of you've got to dial it
[31:11.070 --> 31:16.870]  in. You know, I would recommend starting out with a pro mix or a sunshine for, uh, once
[31:16.870 --> 31:22.670]  you get a grower to down with that and you're really basic soil amendments, then all sunshine
[31:22.670 --> 31:27.790]  for and pro mixes is peat moss and an aerator. And you know, so source those products. It's
[31:27.790 --> 31:32.590]  actually what my last run was done in was sunshine for pro mix. Yeah. And uh, you know,
[31:32.590 --> 31:36.110]  so yeah, I think people get overwhelmed when you start talking about the conversion to
[31:36.110 --> 31:40.390]  organics, but if they only knew how close they already were, you know, so many synthetic
[31:40.390 --> 31:44.510]  growers are using sunshine for, and they're using pro mix. It's like, well, next time
[31:44.510 --> 31:49.270]  you do that, just add in a microbial source like earthworm castings, add in some kelp
[31:49.270 --> 31:54.110]  meal, you know, to help prevent against, you know, fungus gnats and white flies and
[31:54.110 --> 32:01.110]  spider mites add in some neem cake or crustacean meal. Uh, yeah, I mean, easy stuff like that,
[32:01.870 --> 32:05.350]  right? You're mixing soil anyway. You should be, you know, you shouldn't, I don't think
[32:05.350 --> 32:08.510]  you should open the bag and to start pulling out of the bag, you should dump it into something,
[32:08.510 --> 32:13.310]  kind of spread it out. Like I was surprised to learn that synth that, like I said, I've
[32:13.310 --> 32:18.590]  always grown organically. So I was, I see a lot of the commercial synthetic growers
[32:18.590 --> 32:21.870]  and kind of how they're doing stuff. And I was really surprised to see even they had
[32:21.870 --> 32:25.470]  been in the shit out of their soil. I mean, they're growing, you know, in pro mix and
[32:25.470 --> 32:28.790]  that'd be going poor and the end. They're still running nutrients over it and kill it
[32:28.790 --> 32:33.430]  all. And uh, yeah, I mean, that was something we were trying to talk to a friend about last
[32:33.430 --> 32:36.630]  night is finding that balance between the worm castings and the advanced nutrients.
[32:36.630 --> 32:40.270]  He's like, can I do this? And we're trying to tell him gently that your advanced is just
[32:40.270 --> 32:44.590]  going to kill all that stuff, bro. Throw away those advanced bottles. Yeah. You know, I,
[32:44.590 --> 32:49.350]  if you're want to make the, if you want to make the switch, then you need to not get
[32:49.350 --> 32:54.990]  advanced nutrients. Go get something like a general organics or roots organics or bio
[32:54.990 --> 33:00.110]  biz or even botanic air is not as organic as they try to advertise. It's far from it.
[33:00.110 --> 33:05.670]  Yeah. I mean, even if you were to go age old is a really old school product. It really
[33:05.670 --> 33:11.550]  is so cheap and I know so many people who crush it with age old. I've got a friend who
[33:11.550 --> 33:16.270]  grows nothing but I read genetics with nothing but age old and it's so cheap. I mean, you
[33:16.270 --> 33:20.510]  want to talk about low cost of production? Who cares if, I mean, you know, you'll yield
[33:20.510 --> 33:24.590]  good, but even if you didn't, it's so fucking cheap. You're only paying for power, right?
[33:24.590 --> 33:29.270]  Yeah. That's the truth. And that's the beauty of organics, organics. I'm making the switch
[33:29.270 --> 33:33.470]  and I love it. I've really seen a difference in my plants. Uh, they perform better. They
[33:33.470 --> 33:37.870]  don't seem, and I do, I've been growing cannabis for a long time and the plants always seemed
[33:37.870 --> 33:40.950]  like they were thriving to me. And now that I'm using the organics, I can see that I was
[33:40.990 --> 33:45.190]  missing something. They look, they're just look, they're waxier. They don't have, they
[33:45.190 --> 33:50.950]  have more, uh, the cuticles on the leaves are thicker. Uh, the stems are more robust
[33:50.950 --> 33:54.910]  and I was feeding, I've fed all the commercial brands of nutrients before and I'm definitely
[33:54.910 --> 33:58.630]  noticing a difference with just basic and just small jumps to organics. It's not even
[33:58.630 --> 33:59.630]  anything major.
[33:59.630 --> 34:06.110]  Well, I, I, then you tell me you, since you come from a, the synthetic world, is it easier?
[34:06.110 --> 34:11.910]  I hear a lot of people tell me it's more complicated, but I am not the most, I mean,
[34:11.910 --> 34:16.630]  I do a lot of other stuff, but you know what I mean? I'm not in my growth like I used to
[34:16.630 --> 34:18.750]  be in my, my plants are fine.
[34:18.750 --> 34:24.350]  The way I think this seems to make more sense to me than mixing up bottles like a scientist.
[34:24.350 --> 34:27.790]  And I've read all of my bottles anyway, so I know what that's coming from. Like I know
[34:27.790 --> 34:31.710]  that that's chicken shit and seabird guano. Why don't I just use chicken shit and seabird
[34:31.710 --> 34:36.590]  guano? Like, and I think I didn't trust myself to make those mixtures. I thought I'd burn
[34:36.590 --> 34:41.550]  something or whatever, but there are so many guides between you, the Rev and every forum
[34:41.550 --> 34:46.070]  on the internet. I can find the correct mixture for everything. And this podcast now, this
[34:46.070 --> 34:47.070]  is a good reference.
[34:47.070 --> 34:50.710]  Your plants are going to be way more forgiving to you putting the guano on it than to you
[34:50.710 --> 34:54.190]  putting a bottled nutrient that's got guano in it on it.
[34:54.190 --> 34:58.470]  True. Very true. That's more concentrated and I can definitely add too much of that
[34:58.470 --> 34:59.470]  way easily.
[34:59.470 --> 35:00.470]  Exactly.
[35:00.470 --> 35:04.590]  I don't even like using guano. I'm going to stay away from any kind of shit in my plants.
[35:04.590 --> 35:09.830]  Guano is actually extremely unsustainable to harvest. Um, and then it's really bad for
[35:09.830 --> 35:15.070]  you to breathe in. But I know a lot of people are diehard about it. And, uh, personally
[35:15.070 --> 35:19.310]  I think it like produces some really awesome outdoor. Um,
[35:19.310 --> 35:22.830]  Well, Jesse will swear by it for the outdoor growers.
[35:22.830 --> 35:27.030]  Jesse would come chop us down right now for saying bad things about his Jamaican guano.
[35:27.030 --> 35:32.150]  The guano is pretty banging for outdoor. Um, not, you know, there's other options,
[35:32.150 --> 35:34.030]  but hey, to each his own.
[35:34.030 --> 35:37.270]  And if we're dissing your growing methods, I'm sorry, we're not dissing it. We're just,
[35:37.270 --> 35:42.110]  uh, trying to encourage you to do more sustainable, healthier things. Do what you want, do what
[35:42.110 --> 35:44.510]  you want. You're going to get it. If you, if you're okay with it, go for it.
[35:44.510 --> 35:45.510]  Yeah. I don't want to smoke poop.
[35:45.510 --> 35:51.350]  I don't eat meat. You know what I mean? I don't eat GMO foods. I live, I have a certain
[35:51.350 --> 35:56.230]  lifestyle that I try to live by and I incorporate that all the way into the medicine and the
[35:56.230 --> 36:00.590]  plants that I grow. So, you know, I don't force it. I hang out with people who eat
[36:00.590 --> 36:04.270]  meat, hang out with people who grow synthetics. Like it's no biggie. Like to each his own.
[36:04.270 --> 36:10.350]  You don't have to, I really, I get attacked a lot on Instagram and a lot of these like
[36:10.350 --> 36:13.950]  other places when I feel like when I try to put information out there, I feel like I get
[36:13.950 --> 36:19.190]  met with a lot of resistance. Um, but I'm not telling, I'm not trying to tell people
[36:19.190 --> 36:24.470]  how to do things. I'm just trying to give it, put information out there. Um, so please
[36:24.470 --> 36:30.990]  don't argue with me. If you like it, take it in. You know, if you don't unfollow me,
[36:30.990 --> 36:36.070]  follow someone else. There's plenty of other Instagram pages to troll. You can hit those.
[36:36.070 --> 36:40.750]  Yeah. You know, but uh, that being said, if you, if you ever have questions and you're
[36:40.750 --> 36:46.150]  serious and you want to know something, just a direct message me, email me, email Jeff.
[36:46.150 --> 36:51.270]  Yeah. I got your back. You will get the, you know, we'll get you the knowledge you need.
[36:52.270 --> 36:55.910]  Yeah. We know we've got resources for all kinds of knowledge. I was funny cause we were
[36:55.910 --> 36:59.430]  at a growers meeting last night and Sean and I were both stumped on something and people
[36:59.430 --> 37:02.830]  looked at us like, well, what the fuck? If you guys don't know, then what is the answer?
[37:02.830 --> 37:07.430]  And we're like, sorry guys, there's some shit we're not going to know. I've never seen that.
[37:07.430 --> 37:11.190]  So I don't know. Give me three days to research it. We'll find out. But right now you might
[37:11.190 --> 37:16.070]  have to call Jim for air. Yeah. But I feel like people have this, like, I don't know.
[37:16.070 --> 37:20.590]  They've got this idea that we can just look at one picture on your phone. Are you going
[37:20.590 --> 37:24.830]  to send me a one direct message and I'm going to know what you fed them for the past three
[37:24.830 --> 37:29.790]  weeks? Yeah. We'll try. Yeah. We'll try. But sometimes, yeah, that one last night was a
[37:29.790 --> 37:33.190]  weird challenge. I don't know what it was. It was powdery, something mildewish looking
[37:33.190 --> 37:39.310]  stuff. Unfortunately, that was a case of, uh, all too, it's all too familiar. I, like
[37:39.310 --> 37:43.630]  I knew him personally. I was actually working with him on that before the meeting. He was
[37:43.630 --> 37:47.710]  introduced to me through a friend of mine. But, uh, yeah, I thought it was powdery mildew
[37:47.790 --> 37:52.430]  originally. And then we thought it was a pH problem and they thought it was new law and
[37:52.430 --> 37:56.750]  it, it's all too familiar of a problem. He actually, you know, wasn't too familiar with
[37:56.750 --> 38:02.270]  growing, uh, went to the local hydro store, not high grow because if he, you know, Jesse
[38:02.270 --> 38:06.030]  would have helped him, the guy would have been killing it. But he goes to these horrible
[38:06.030 --> 38:11.630]  competitors here in town and they set him up on what he thinks is cocoa. Uh, they give
[38:11.710 --> 38:18.430]  him a cocoa nutrient. Uh, he's running it. Turns out it's peat moss and he, you know,
[38:18.430 --> 38:25.070]  so it happens and he's embarrassed and it's not his fault. No, I mean, the guy's awesome
[38:25.070 --> 38:29.950]  and he's learned so much and he's, his plants are still alive even after all of that. You
[38:29.950 --> 38:33.470]  know, like, I mean, his, we saw fucked up pictures of them, but Hey, they're still
[38:33.470 --> 38:37.790]  kicking. Yeah. If he makes it to harvest, that's what counts, you know, but, uh,
[38:37.790 --> 38:42.590]  perseverance, you know, you just got to keep, stay committed to it. Don't, if you think that
[38:42.590 --> 38:46.270]  I grew beautiful plants every time you're out of your mind, Oh man, I just don't pick,
[38:46.270 --> 38:49.710]  I just don't put pictures of the ugly ones on Instagram. There's plenty of ugly shit
[38:49.710 --> 38:53.710]  that I've done. Uh, I'll admit it one time I had, and this was years ago, the first time
[38:53.710 --> 38:58.030]  it was the first time I said I was in a new house growing in a brand new basement in the
[38:58.030 --> 39:01.550]  middle of winter and I'd never grown in there before. And you got to dial in a room, but I
[39:01.550 --> 39:06.590]  had a white rhino plant in a seven gallon pot that probably weighed between five and six ounces.
[39:06.590 --> 39:10.830]  And I went to cut it down and I noticed powdery mildew all up the one side that was near the
[39:10.830 --> 39:15.230]  exterior wall corner. So that wall was colder than the whole rest of the room. And it got powdery
[39:15.230 --> 39:19.710]  mildew. Uh, it was ugly as shit. And my buddy Mike was there helping me trim. And I said, Hey,
[39:19.710 --> 39:23.790]  Mike, watch this. And I chopped the plant and usually he's got a hand on it when I cut it so
[39:23.790 --> 39:27.070]  that it doesn't timber, you know, and I just cut that son of a bitch right to the ground, just
[39:27.070 --> 39:30.350]  timber. And it hit the floor. And he looked at me like, what the hell, man? And I was like,
[39:30.350 --> 39:34.110]  there's powdery mildew on it. We're throwing the whole plant away. Yeah, it happens. I mean,
[39:34.110 --> 39:38.590]  people ask me all the time. How do you know if it works? That's how thousands and thousands of
[39:38.590 --> 39:44.270]  dollars worth of just R and D. But if you're going to try something crazy, try it on one plant. If
[39:44.270 --> 39:48.190]  you have the option, don't do something ridiculous. Don't defoliate. I've been trying extreme
[39:48.190 --> 39:53.230]  defoliation on one plant. I won't do it to more than one. I see a difference and I like it.
[39:53.230 --> 39:57.550]  Honestly, guys, I doubted it in the beginning, but I like it. And I learned this the hard way.
[39:58.190 --> 40:02.910]  In every scientific experiment, for God's sake, make sure you have a control
[40:04.030 --> 40:07.790]  and maybe take some notes. Exactly. We're high and we forget a lot of shit. Yeah,
[40:07.790 --> 40:11.150]  because you don't want to run a six month trial. Yeah. To the end of it,
[40:11.790 --> 40:15.390]  take pictures if you can post them on Instagram. They'll stay there. Stay there. So you have notes.
[40:16.190 --> 40:20.190]  We should go for about five more minutes. Guys, the last episode was short and you listen to every
[40:20.190 --> 40:24.030]  minute of it. I can see the stats. I can tell how long you listen. Holy crap. Thanks for listening
[40:24.030 --> 40:27.310]  to the whole thing. That was cool. I appreciate that. I hope you like that solo episode.
[40:27.310 --> 40:32.110]  It's hard to do solo shows. I feel like we covered the molasses thing is going to be the
[40:32.110 --> 40:36.030]  groundbreaker for the episode. I like that we covered soil pretty well. Do you have any wrap
[40:36.030 --> 40:42.350]  up notes for soil? Keep it simple. There you go. Keep it simple. Stoner. That's what I would say.
[40:42.350 --> 40:46.670]  That's all I got to say. All right, dude. Huge thanks for coming. Thanks for having me. You
[40:46.670 --> 40:50.910]  gave it like 45 minutes before we even recorded, which is awesome. It's so awesome. People like,
[40:50.910 --> 40:54.110]  how long does it take? And I'm like, allow two or three hours when you get here because
[40:54.110 --> 40:58.110]  we like to dab and bullshit. That's fine. Today is a special day. You guys, I might get
[40:58.110 --> 41:01.870]  terrified for this. I had to save it to the end. Happy birthday, Jenny Cush. We love you. Today,
[41:01.870 --> 41:07.070]  this episode is being recorded on the on Jenny Cush's birthday. She'd be 36. I can't talk too
[41:07.070 --> 41:09.950]  much about it because it'll make me cry. Happy birthday, Jenny. We love you. We miss you. Wish
[41:09.950 --> 41:14.190]  you. We wish you were still here with us. Guys, Jenny, Google Jenny Cush if you can check her
[41:14.190 --> 41:19.070]  out. You must support Jenny Cush in the movement. Green and healthy cannabis and Turpex. Love you
[41:19.150 --> 41:24.190]  guys. Big shout out on the next episode. I was told that Spence in the garden of Weedon are
[41:24.190 --> 41:27.470]  coming. So hopefully we can get Spence over here. He says he's coming tomorrow night to record. I
[41:27.470 --> 41:33.310]  hope he brings Maddie big mics invited. This will be a good time. Also, I am going to record with
[41:33.310 --> 41:37.710]  the grimy Gatsby and Turpex next week. So we got an episode coming up with those guys. I'm taking
[41:37.710 --> 41:41.630]  the recording equipment up to Colorado Springs. I'm going to go hang out at the Turpey boy house
[41:41.630 --> 41:47.550]  and hit the mother ship. What up guys? I cannot wait to come. I've been talking about golden goat
[41:47.550 --> 41:52.430]  and lemon Jeffrey seeds. They're right on schedule. So I'm saying like 85, 80 days from now,
[41:52.430 --> 41:57.230]  we should have some new seeds ready on the next episode. I'm going to talk to spin up the I think
[41:57.230 --> 42:02.590]  the next episode I'm gonna talk to Spence about fucking Rosen, dude. Rosen, you guys see Rosen
[42:02.590 --> 42:08.750]  tech. What the fuck, bro? Big shout out to soil grown and the Rosen thing, man. I've actually
[42:09.390 --> 42:14.670]  turned some food. I had a whole bunch of food grade cooking grade or whatever you want to call
[42:14.670 --> 42:20.110]  it from my last wash, my last harvest. I mean, jars full of it sit in the cupboard, but yeah,
[42:20.110 --> 42:26.110]  shout out to soil. Finally having it. If you guys are on Instagram, check out at soil grown on
[42:26.110 --> 42:29.870]  Instagram. That dude is killing it with some new things called Rosin tech. Uh, if you guys are
[42:29.870 --> 42:32.670]  going to try making Rosin tech, don't burn yourselves. That's all I've got to say. Cause
[42:32.670 --> 42:35.790]  that's going to hurt. And we're going to start seeing, we've seen Rosin tech happened and then
[42:35.790 --> 42:39.630]  we've seen people follow suit. And now I'm waiting for the Rosin tech burns. That's what's going to
[42:39.630 --> 42:44.750]  be next. Uh, also if you're on Instagram, check out dragon flight earth medicine. Uh, holy shit.
[42:44.750 --> 42:48.270]  You learn a lot of great things. Something I want to talk about more in the future is the Bokashi
[42:48.270 --> 42:52.510]  bucket. It's something I'm experimenting with right now. Great results. Cannot believe I didn't do
[42:52.510 --> 42:56.350]  this earlier. Thanks a lot to Rocky mountain worm company and Sean for hooking me up with that.
[42:56.350 --> 43:00.830]  That's really cool. No problem. Game changer, dude. I added the liquid that came out of there
[43:00.830 --> 43:05.310]  to my worm tea and it's the best worm tea I've ever made. And I saw results within 24 hours on
[43:05.310 --> 43:10.270]  my plants. And then, uh, everybody out there, check out, uh, the Bokashi bucket on Instagram.
[43:10.270 --> 43:15.550]  Yeah. Um, they actually have their own page. Uh, they're a super awesome group of guys down in
[43:15.550 --> 43:22.430]  Hawaii. I've had the pleasure of meeting them. I actually, I gave one of the guys, uh, one of their
[43:22.430 --> 43:27.470]  first dabs here and I was actually at the Emerald cup, but I was dabbing him out on some full melt,
[43:27.470 --> 43:32.830]  but a shout out to the Bokashi bucket guys. They're great guys. Yeah. I think you can pick
[43:32.830 --> 43:36.590]  up the buckets. Uh, if you're hydro shop or you're, if the Rocky mountain worm company does
[43:36.590 --> 43:41.950]  have them, but if you're not near us, you can get them. Uh, the Bokashi bucket guys have a website
[43:41.950 --> 43:46.190]  or also whole foods sells them. So there's a whole foods in your area. Go check out the
[43:46.190 --> 43:49.310]  chicks in the yoga pants and Ugg boots and pick yourself up a Bokashi bucket.
[43:50.830 --> 43:55.150]  Yeah. Um, let's wrap up the show. I don't think there's much left to say tonight. We've done a
[43:55.150 --> 44:00.030]  lot of work. People have probably took four pages of notes. Cause I took a page and a half myself.
[44:00.030 --> 44:03.070]  I hope you guys wrote all that down. Shout out to hippie nurse. I know you write down a bunch of
[44:03.070 --> 44:07.230]  notes. I hope you went through seven or eight pages on this episode. She really listens.
[44:07.230 --> 44:12.430]  That's awesome. I just talk. So that's somebody you had notes too, man. So I'm glad you came
[44:12.430 --> 44:16.270]  prepared. Thanks again for coming, dude. You have, you're changing, growing for a lot of people.
