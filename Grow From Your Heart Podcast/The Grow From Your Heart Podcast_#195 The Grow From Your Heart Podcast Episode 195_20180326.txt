[00:01.080 --> 00:18.320]  Hey, what's up, podcast world? It's Rasta Jeff. It's time for episode number 195 of
[00:18.320 --> 00:21.560]  the Grow It From Your Heart podcast. I'm doing that thing where I throw out old episodes.
[00:21.560 --> 00:26.640]  This time I'm putting out episodes 21, 22, 23, and 24 of what used to be known as the
[00:26.640 --> 00:30.840]  I Grow Culture podcast, currently called the Grow It From Your Heart podcast. Ladies and
[00:30.840 --> 00:34.480]  gentlemen, before we get to the old episodes, let me make a couple of quick updates and
[00:34.480 --> 00:40.480]  disclaimers. The new email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. If you'd like to contact me, that is probably
[00:40.480 --> 00:44.920]  the best way to do it. Growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I would love to hear from you. I'd love to
[00:44.920 --> 00:49.680]  answer all of your questions, but you got to send them to growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[00:49.680 --> 00:53.600]  I'd love to hear from you there. Also, the Twitter feed is now at GFYH podcast. If you'd
[00:53.600 --> 00:57.920]  like to follow us on Twitter, I would love that. Also, if you want to find us on Facebook,
[00:57.920 --> 01:04.120]  simply search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Also, I have recorded 195 episodes.
[01:04.120 --> 01:08.040]  A lot of my opinions, ideas, and techniques and methods may have changed. I may have said
[01:08.040 --> 01:11.200]  some things in the past that I don't agree with now. I may have taught a method that
[01:11.200 --> 01:15.120]  I don't use anymore. Please don't hold anything against me. Please keep in mind that this
[01:15.120 --> 01:19.280]  is an ever evolving project, and I will try to keep you updated the best I can. Some of
[01:19.280 --> 01:22.720]  the old information may be outdated. That's why I do a podcast. That's why I didn't write
[01:22.720 --> 01:26.800]  a book because I can keep new info coming. Ladies and gentlemen, without any more rambling,
[01:26.800 --> 01:33.480]  without any further ado, here are episodes 21, 22, 23, and 24 of what used to be known
[01:33.480 --> 01:42.920]  as the Agriculture Podcast, now known as the Grow From Your Heart Podcast. Thanks for listening,
[02:02.100 --> 02:34.280]  I'm your host, Ross Nujav. Thanks for joining me for another episode. Man, I've been smoking
[02:34.280 --> 02:39.200]  live resin today, and I'm a little bit dabbed out, a little more dabbed out than usual.
[02:39.640 --> 02:44.840]  We're smoking some stuff called Bare Naked. You don't know about the Bare Naked yet,
[02:44.840 --> 02:47.440]  but when you hear about it, you'll remember that you heard about it on the Agriculture
[02:47.440 --> 02:53.640]  Podcast first. I want to give a big shout out to Spence and the whole Garden of Wheaton crew. They
[02:53.640 --> 02:57.880]  let me hang out for a couple hours tonight on the couch, take some dabs, talk a little bit,
[02:57.880 --> 03:01.200]  be social. It was fun. Thanks for the dabs, thanks for the live resin, thanks for the
[03:01.200 --> 03:06.160]  Bare Naked. Much respect, appreciate it guys. This episode was brought to you by

[03:53.920 --> 03:57.240]  quiet. That was awkward. It's like when you're at a concert and you're yelling, and then all of a
[03:57.240 --> 04:02.320]  sudden the song stops and all they can hear is you yelling. You're always saying a really stupid
[04:02.320 --> 04:07.840]  word at that time. So I had nachos in my butt or something like that. Yeah, Oil Slick, shout out to
[04:07.840 --> 04:11.280]  those guys. Send them a tweet, tell them you're listening to the show. Big shout out to our
[04:11.280 --> 04:15.280]  friends at TreeThugger.com. This episode is brought to you in part by TreeThugger.com,
[04:15.280 --> 04:20.400]  live music lifestyle magazine. Check out TreeThugger.com for concert and festival news
[04:20.400 --> 04:27.000]  and reviews. And also this show is brought to you largely by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.300]  Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations to serve Colorado. Visit the Denver store at
[04:32.300 --> 04:38.620]  6271 Beach Street, Unit F or stop by the new Pueblo location on 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
[04:38.620 --> 04:43.980]  Colorado. Check out Hygro for competitive pricing and a great selection of indoor
[04:43.980 --> 04:49.140]  grow supplies. Don't forget to check out www.hygrodenver.com for current store hours
[04:49.140 --> 04:55.140]  and current store specials. Actually, I've got an extra ad as bonus for you. Hygro has an awesome
[04:55.140 --> 05:02.140]  sale on Roots Organic Soil. You can get one tote of soil for $550 in-store pickup or $600
[05:02.140 --> 05:07.980]  delivered. This deal is available at both locations, the Pueblo and Denver store. Please
[05:07.980 --> 05:14.180]  contact Hygro to verify delivery availability, delivery availability. I'm not sure how far
[05:14.180 --> 05:18.140]  those guys are willing to drive to haul you there, that tote of soil. So I'm sure a lot
[05:18.140 --> 05:22.740]  of guys are saying, how much is a tote of soil, Rasta Jeff? It's a really good question.
[05:22.740 --> 05:29.260]  The answer is a tote of soil is 54 cubic feet, which is about 350 gallons. It's all in one bag
[05:29.260 --> 05:33.900]  also. So instead of buying a whole bunch of separate bags, you got one big bag here, a little
[05:33.900 --> 05:39.740]  more eco-friendly. So if you're running three gallon pots, that's 116 three gallon pots. If
[05:39.740 --> 05:44.980]  you run five gallon pots, that's 75 gallon pots. If you run seven gallon pots, like I like to do,
[05:44.980 --> 05:51.380]  that's 57 gallon pots. So that's not a bad deal at all there. So go get your dirt at Hygro indoor
[05:51.380 --> 05:58.620]  growing supplies. Let me read the address to you one more time. That is 6271 beach street unit F or
[05:58.620 --> 06:03.820]  the Pueblo location. Uh, that address is in Denver. The Pueblo location is 618 East fourth
[06:03.820 --> 06:09.300]  street in Pueblo on the East side. So go check out Hygro, much respect to all those sponsors.
[06:09.300 --> 06:14.100]  They make the show possible. Big shout out to you guys for listening. We've made it 21 episodes.
[06:14.100 --> 06:18.460]  You guys, that's pretty awesome. I've got a couple of things I wrote down. I wanted to talk
[06:18.460 --> 06:22.260]  about where did I put the paper? Oh, big shout out to natural mystic cannabis caregivers in
[06:22.260 --> 06:27.900]  Colorado Springs. I was running low on shatter, uh, natural mystic cannabis. Caregivers came to
[06:27.900 --> 06:32.700]  the rescue. I got some delicious. I'm reaching for the container right now. I'm also recording
[06:32.700 --> 06:36.700]  this podcast in video. I don't know if I will do anything with the video, but I am actually
[06:36.700 --> 06:41.340]  recording it. So this is Guava sky. I'm just showing the container from natural mystic
[06:41.340 --> 06:46.420]  cannabis caregivers. And this is mystic is what it's called. The mystic has a Torah board in
[06:46.420 --> 06:53.180]  there. It's a high CBD mix. And the Guava sky is the sativa that they had available. I got more of
[06:53.180 --> 06:59.220]  the sativa than I did the CBD mix. That's just my preference. But I'll show you the Guava sky for
[06:59.220 --> 07:02.900]  the guys with the camera. Also take a picture with the, uh, they're seeing the video. I'll take a
[07:02.900 --> 07:06.620]  picture and post this up online, but I'm not watching the video. So I don't know how clear
[07:06.620 --> 07:10.700]  that is. I'm going to stay still for a second so it can focus. So huge shout out to natural
[07:10.700 --> 07:14.260]  mystic cannabis caregivers in Colorado Springs. What's up, Joey? What's up, Shelley? I hope you
[07:14.260 --> 07:19.740]  guys listen. Much love. That's a great shop. If you do need medical marijuana, it does require a
[07:19.740 --> 07:23.100]  red card to get in there. So if you do need your medical marijuana, that's the place in Colorado
[07:23.100 --> 07:29.740]  Springs. I would send you right now. Uh, they have your back. Uh, Shelley's a, uh, a cancer
[07:29.740 --> 07:34.180]  survivor. Uh, so she knows what you're dealing with. If you're sick, she definitely knows how
[07:34.180 --> 07:38.540]  to help you out. She's compassionate. She's friendly. Uh, Joey's hard to find. He's the, uh,
[07:38.580 --> 07:42.020]  he's the boss there. So he's always busy working, but Joey's a great dude. He's super friendly.
[07:42.340 --> 07:45.380]  They'll shake your hand and spend a minute with you if he is in the shop. So shout out to those
[07:45.380 --> 07:50.660]  guys. I got much love for you. Uh, here's a little personal note today is, uh, as I'm
[07:50.660 --> 07:56.700]  recording, it's 4 20 in the morning on July 23rd. Uh, so it is officially the birthday of his
[07:56.700 --> 08:01.260]  Imperial majesty, King Haile Selassie I the first. So, uh, if you know what that is, who that
[08:01.260 --> 08:05.500]  is, uh, you understand why I'm giving thanks and praise, many thanks and praise, many, uh,
[08:05.540 --> 08:10.820]  birthday blessings to King Haile Selassie I the first. Let's take a little, uh, little half a
[08:10.820 --> 08:14.180]  second of silence because it's a podcast. A moment of silence would be ridiculous. So here's a
[08:14.180 --> 08:16.580]  half a second of silence for King Selassie I the first.
[08:19.260 --> 08:23.940]  All right. We got to keep the show moving. Much respect. Um, I am sad to inform you. I'm going to
[08:23.940 --> 08:29.260]  turn the music way down for this one. Also. I'm sad to inform you. We had an event scheduled for
[08:29.260 --> 08:33.060]  July 27th at the brickyard. I've been talking about it quite a bit. We're trying to get that,
[08:33.060 --> 08:38.580]  uh, hookah bar turned into a dab bar. Unfortunately, it's not going to happen. The
[08:38.820 --> 08:44.820]  event is canceled and that place is not going to get to be turned into a smoking establishment. I
[08:44.820 --> 08:51.220]  apologize for advertising an event that didn't happen. Uh, the city is against us every step of
[08:51.220 --> 08:55.700]  the way. They do not want us to get this place open. They do not want us to have our event. I
[08:55.700 --> 08:59.860]  planned on taking live plants to the event so that we could do a little bit of education and I could
[08:59.860 --> 09:04.660]  show a male plant, a female plant. I had plants in different stages of flower for this event,
[09:05.460 --> 09:11.540]  but, uh, we can't take plants that they, they, uh, said they would confiscate the plants. We
[09:11.540 --> 09:15.700]  can't risk taking plants and getting them taken. I just can't do that to myself. That's medicine
[09:15.700 --> 09:19.700]  for my patients. I'm a caregiver and they're going to need that medicine. So I can't do that.
[09:19.700 --> 09:24.980]  So unfortunately the event that I had planned that I had talked about for July 27th at the
[09:24.980 --> 09:30.820]  brickyard is canceled. Uh, we couldn't come to an agreement with the city. They do not want us to do
[09:30.820 --> 09:35.460]  the event. Uh, I don't want anybody to get in trouble. I don't want my plants to get taken. So
[09:35.460 --> 09:42.420]  we have, uh, we have backed out of the event and I do apologize for that. Uh, the other day I said
[09:42.420 --> 09:46.740]  something on the show. I don't remember if I said it on the show or just in a conversation with
[09:46.740 --> 09:52.180]  people, but I need to correct something that I said. I'm going to go to a website here. This is
[09:52.180 --> 09:56.980]  actually, uh, from Ed Rosenthal's. I've just got it on my computer. It's easier to do while we're
[09:56.980 --> 10:01.220]  doing a show. Ed Rosenthal's marijuana growers handbook. I'm trying to show it to the camera.
[10:01.220 --> 10:04.980]  I'm not watching the video. I should put the video up on the screen so I can see the video feed.
[10:04.980 --> 10:12.340]  Uh, here we go. This is the book that, uh, I'm coming from. So I said something about red
[10:12.340 --> 10:16.580]  spectrum, right? And I may have gotten it backwards for what I told you guys. So this is from the book
[10:16.580 --> 10:20.500]  I just showed you all credit for what I'm saying right now. It goes to Ed Rosenthal. Ed, don't get
[10:20.500 --> 10:25.220]  mad at me for saying this on the show. Uh, you'd want people to know this. It's called the critical
[10:25.220 --> 10:28.420]  light period. And let me give you a quick explanation of what the critical light period is,
[10:28.420 --> 10:32.420]  in my opinion, and like a little quick, uh, cause you need to know that to get to where we are.
[10:32.420 --> 10:38.660]  The critical light period is the amount of dark time that a specific cannabis strain will take
[10:38.660 --> 10:43.460]  to flower. So let me elaborate with Ed's article here. I take a big breath cause I've been taking
[10:43.460 --> 10:50.820]  dabs. All right. This 12 total formula has been accepted without question by growers all over the
[10:50.820 --> 10:57.140]  world. Probably, probably one of the reasons for this was my discussion of the technique in some
[10:57.140 --> 11:02.420]  of my early books. The 12, 12 regimen was selected because my coauthor and I reasoned that no matter
[11:02.420 --> 11:07.140]  what critical period of variety might have given 12 hours of darkness, it would flower. However,
[11:07.140 --> 11:14.100]  most marijuana varieties need fewer than 12 hours of darkness to flower. Now, what I was talking
[11:14.100 --> 11:18.420]  about with somebody was they were saying that their plants are starting to flower and it's not
[11:18.420 --> 11:25.860]  12 hours of darkness outside. Uh, yes, that's because of the sunset and the sunrise have
[11:25.860 --> 11:30.180]  specific color spectrums that are triggering hormones in your plants is what I was telling
[11:30.180 --> 11:35.460]  them. And I was calling all of this info from memory. So I think I got it backwards to tell
[11:35.460 --> 11:39.380]  you the truth. So, uh, if I said that on a podcast or if I said that to you in person,
[11:39.380 --> 11:43.380]  I need to correct that. Here's what Ed Rosenthal has written a little bit more about it.
[11:44.100 --> 11:49.620]  If marijuana plants grown outdoors required a 12 hour dark period to flower, they would not be
[11:49.620 --> 11:54.820]  induced to start flowering until September 21st, the first day of autumn, one day and night are
[11:54.820 --> 12:00.260]  equal length. They would ripen six to eight weeks later in real life. Most modern varieties ripen
[12:00.260 --> 12:06.180]  between early September and late October budding was triggered 68 weeks earlier. For instance,
[12:06.180 --> 12:11.140]  an eight week variety that requires 55 days from forcing to maturity, which would normally
[12:11.140 --> 12:17.700]  ripen October 1st would start flowering August 1st at that day in San Francisco, sunrise occurs
[12:17.700 --> 12:24.340]  at five 14 and sunset at nine 18, which is seven 18, a total of 14 hours and four minutes
[12:24.900 --> 12:30.740]  dawn and dusk at another 15 minutes of red light plants use the absence of this spectrum to measure
[12:30.740 --> 12:36.500]  the dark period. The total lit period came to about 14 hours and 20 minutes, leaving nine hours
[12:36.500 --> 12:42.260]  and 40 minutes of darkness. The critical period for this plant was nine hours and 40 minutes.
[12:42.260 --> 12:47.220]  If it were given just 10 hours of dark period daily indoors, rather than 12, it would still
[12:47.220 --> 12:52.340]  flower gardeners growing indoors who discover the critical time need to induce flowering.
[12:53.060 --> 12:57.380]  The critical time needed to induce flowering can use this information to get more efficient use of
[12:57.380 --> 13:02.580]  their indoor garden. Currently plants grown under a 12, 12 cycle spend half their time in the dark.
[13:03.220 --> 13:07.940]  If these plants have a critical flowering time of, for instance, 10 hours of darkness daily,
[13:07.940 --> 13:14.660]  they can be provided 14 rather than 12 hours of light each day so that they can receive almost
[13:14.660 --> 13:21.540]  17% more energy, which they use to produce sugars used for more and faster growth.
[13:24.500 --> 13:32.020]  Does that make any sense to you guys? It's called the critical period for the specific
[13:32.020 --> 13:36.900]  strain. Most of your Cush strains, your Indica stuff, that's going to have a critical period
[13:37.460 --> 13:42.820]  apparently closer to... That's going to have your 12 hour stuff. Your more equatorial stuff,
[13:42.820 --> 13:48.260]  you may be able to cut that down just a little bit. Actually, I heard DJ Short say that he runs
[13:48.260 --> 13:56.740]  most of his plants on a... It's 13 off, 11 on. He said that that shows a little bit more
[13:56.740 --> 14:03.060]  phenotypical expression is what that does, which means that if you're growing from seed and you're
[14:03.060 --> 14:08.820]  trying to find that keeper, you'll get to see larger variances in your seed stock if you've
[14:08.820 --> 14:13.620]  got a little F1 hybrid there. I had another article. I got to click back a couple of steps
[14:13.620 --> 14:21.940]  here. Maybe I've lost it. I learned a whole lot of stuff about... Here it is. Sorry, I hate to
[14:21.940 --> 14:26.020]  stumble through that, but looking for stuff on the internet while I'm talking. This guy broke
[14:26.020 --> 14:30.820]  something down. There are things... Cannabis plants... Where's this coming from? Let me give
[14:30.820 --> 14:36.740]  credit. This is from marijuanagrowershq.com slash light cycles and flowering cannabis.
[14:38.580 --> 14:43.700]  Says, cannabis plants are referred to as long night or short day plants because they require
[14:43.700 --> 14:48.260]  a long period of darkness to trigger the hormone that tell the plant to switch from vegetative
[14:48.260 --> 14:54.100]  growth to flowering. These light receptors are color pigments in the leaves called phytochrome
[14:54.180 --> 14:58.660]  red and phytochrome far red. They're going to start abbreviating that, so I need to try to
[14:58.660 --> 15:02.820]  remember which is which. These pigments get their names from the types of light they absorb.
[15:03.460 --> 15:09.940]  Phytochrome red absorbs red light between 600 and 760. It doesn't give me a definition of what those
[15:09.940 --> 15:19.540]  are. Phytochrome far red absorbs far light between 760 and 800 nm. I don't remember what nm is.
[15:20.100 --> 15:24.020]  That's... I should. Sorry. I went blank on that one just now when they wrote it on the screen.
[15:24.660 --> 15:29.620]  These two pigments chemically react to the light and trigger the plant to flower or not. This is
[15:29.620 --> 15:35.700]  where it gets a little confusing. In cannabis plants, the normal presence of phytochrome far
[15:35.700 --> 15:40.260]  red switches off the flowering signal. The level of phytochrome far red is what you can manipulate
[15:40.260 --> 15:46.500]  to adjust the photo period. Phytochrome far red is quickly produced when plants are exposed to light
[15:46.500 --> 15:54.020]  that contains far red wavelengths. When there is light, the phytochrome far red and phytochrome
[15:54.020 --> 15:59.460]  red maintain a balance. When the sun goes down or the lights go out, the darkness gradually switches
[15:59.460 --> 16:04.900]  the phytochrome far red to phytochrome red. Because of this, the phytochrome red levels
[16:04.900 --> 16:10.820]  gradually increase and the far red gradually decreases during the dark period. The presence
[16:10.900 --> 16:16.340]  of red is a neutral condition to the plants and essentially tells them nothing.
[16:16.340 --> 16:20.980]  When the light returns or if a small amount of far red light interrupts a dark period,
[16:20.980 --> 16:26.260]  the red immediately switches back to far red. If the plant is without light long enough,
[16:26.260 --> 16:32.660]  the far red will decrease past a tipping point. This decreased level of phytochrome far red
[16:32.660 --> 16:38.740]  signals the plants that fall is approaching and the plants begin flowering. In short,
[16:38.740 --> 16:43.700]  the presence of phytochrome far red due to long hours of light and short hours of darkness keep
[16:43.700 --> 16:48.980]  the plants in the vegetative phase. If the plant experiences enough hours of darkness,
[16:48.980 --> 16:55.060]  most of the phytochrome far red turns to phytochrome red and the low level of far
[16:55.060 --> 17:00.820]  red signals the plant hormones to begin flowering. That's a really technical version of what I tried
[17:00.820 --> 17:06.100]  to say the last time I gave this a little rant and I think I got it completely backwards to tell
[17:06.100 --> 17:09.860]  you the honest truth. So that goes to show you right there that sometimes you got to do your
[17:09.860 --> 17:14.100]  research. You got to remind yourself, even if you think you know what you're doing, you might fuck
[17:14.100 --> 17:17.380]  up and say something wrong on a podcast and try to embarrass yourself. But you know what? I don't
[17:17.380 --> 17:21.700]  feel embarrassed. I'm glad that I got to learn with you guys. We're going to go find out what
[17:21.700 --> 17:25.780]  that one little abbreviation that they wrote there. I've never seen it written like that before.
[17:26.420 --> 17:29.300]  I'm going to find out what that means so I can share that with you. Where was it?
[17:29.620 --> 17:34.820]  Right there. I'm going to Google that and find out what that means.
[17:39.040 --> 17:47.280]  Googling it right now. NM light. Measurement definition pops up as soon as I start typing that.
[17:47.920 --> 17:52.240]  Visible light is usually defined as having a wavelength. Okay. So that is nanometers,
[17:52.240 --> 17:56.640]  what I thought it was. They just wrote it small N capital M and I haven't seen it like that. So
[17:56.640 --> 18:02.640]  that's nanometers is what I thought it was there in that article. All right. Doing pretty good on
[18:02.640 --> 18:09.040]  that one until Safari just decided to freeze up. There we go. Cool. All right. So man, this is
[18:09.040 --> 18:14.480]  going to be a short episode. I really just wanted to come on and talk about having to cancel the
[18:15.280 --> 18:20.080]  committee for the responsible regulation of cannabis party that we were going to have at
[18:20.080 --> 18:23.360]  the Brickyard. I want to say that once again, in case you guys are skimming through this episode,
[18:23.360 --> 18:28.080]  the party, the seminar, the educational seminar we planned to host, it has been canceled.
[18:28.880 --> 18:32.240]  I was going to take some live plants and show you guys those. We had people that were going to talk
[18:32.240 --> 18:37.760]  about all kinds of cool stuff. We had a miniature job fair planned out. The city of Pueblo does not
[18:37.760 --> 18:41.840]  want that to happen. So I apologize. It's beyond our control. The police department have threatened
[18:41.840 --> 18:45.440]  us and scared us and we don't want police interaction. So we're going to back out.
[18:45.440 --> 18:49.920]  We're going to bow down and just not do that. Sorry. It's the best we can do right now for
[18:49.920 --> 18:56.560]  what we've got. All right. Enough begging for your forgiveness. I do apologize. If you were
[18:56.560 --> 19:01.520]  planning to come out, message me and we'll find something else to do. How's that? So if you're
[19:01.520 --> 19:08.000]  listening on Twitter or Facebook or whatever, message me and we'll hang out since I had that
[19:08.000 --> 19:13.600]  night booked because I thought I'd be doing stuff anyway. So yeah, let's wrap up this episode. It
[19:13.600 --> 19:17.520]  was kind of a quick episode. I want to give another, I want to mention that coupon or that
[19:17.520 --> 19:23.760]  ad that Hygro Pueblo and Hygro Denver are both doing. You can get yourself a gigantic bag of
[19:23.760 --> 19:32.080]  roots organic soil for 550 bucks or $600. Honestly, dude, 25, seven gallon pots or 57 gallon pots
[19:32.080 --> 19:39.440]  worth of soil. That's two runs in a four light room, in my opinion. So if that tells you anything
[19:39.440 --> 19:43.680]  with what you could do with that amount of soil, that is awesome. Big shout out to all of our
[19:43.680 --> 19:48.320]  sponsors. I want to give a shout out to the Grimy Gatsby. The Grimy Gatsby, thanks for hooking us up.
[19:49.120 --> 19:53.520]  Good folks over there. Check out the grimygatsby.com. What's up, much love, much respect.
[19:54.240 --> 19:58.640]  So let's do that end of the show wrap up thing. Oh, I'm going to try to get Jesse back. I was
[19:58.640 --> 20:02.240]  talking to Jesse. He's getting married and he actually texted me. When am I going to be back
[20:02.240 --> 20:06.320]  on the show? So I promise he's coming back soon. We'll get him back on the show, do that outdoor
[20:06.320 --> 20:12.400]  grow lesson for you. Big thanks to King Haile Selassie. I had the first, we used to do that
[20:12.400 --> 20:16.480]  give thanks portion, but I've been cramming so much stuff into one episode that I haven't done it.
[20:16.480 --> 20:21.200]  So officially give thanks to King Selassie. The first is my give thanks on this episode. I'm not
[20:21.200 --> 20:26.800]  going to go on about that. If you know, you know, that's all there is to that one. Check us out on

[22:11.990 --> 22:22.160]  Way back. I used that route so I backed out and I doubt I'll ever make it back. I see the way you
[22:22.160 --> 22:27.600]  act. I'm a cocky, jealous crap. Something's fishy here. I think I smell a rat. This is our house,
[22:27.600 --> 22:35.270]  but we ain't gotta tell them that. Let's leave them at the front door, you dab pack. Same routine,
[22:35.270 --> 22:39.750]  slightly different from the last track. A million songs about weed, but where the dabs at? If you
[22:39.750 --> 22:44.950]  don't like my dabbing songs, you can kiss my ass crack. Come on everybody, drop another huge bomb.

[23:02.460 --> 23:06.860]  TNL Linus, no Tasking Linus TNL the movement. Sorry, I'm a little distracted. I'm sitting here
[23:06.860 --> 23:13.740]  trying to open this edible that I bought. I'm trying to eat a Mountain Medicine 350 milligram
[23:14.300 --> 23:19.100]  active cannabis, delightful chocolate, peanut butter bar, Mountain Medicine, get your goat on,
[23:19.820 --> 23:25.580]  medical marijuana edible. The new rules say that these packages have to be childproof and God damn.
[23:27.980 --> 23:31.340]  On the microphone with me is my buddy Adam Gaskins. He's hanging out. We're going to do just
[23:31.340 --> 23:35.020]  kind of a fun episode today. I got a couple of things to talk about. Nothing super planned out.
[23:35.020 --> 23:39.260]  Say what's up bro. What's up? Thanks for coming man. Thanks for coming. Hey, no problem. So I'm
[23:39.260 --> 23:44.540]  sitting here watching him struggle with this packaging and he's, he's bit at it. He's starting
[23:44.540 --> 23:49.100]  to grab instruments and trying to like cut it open. He's got a pair of scissors, probably 20
[23:50.220 --> 23:54.780]  right over there behind you. Yeah. Yeah. Well that thanks dude. That reminds me part of our
[23:54.780 --> 23:59.180]  talk. We may talk if I even get into it, I'm going to eat this edibles. It's 350 milligrams.
[23:59.180 --> 24:03.420]  Welcome to episode number 22 of the agriculture podcast. Of course I'm Rasta Jeff. You're joining
[24:03.420 --> 24:07.980]  us on another episode. We'll do sponsors in just a second. A big shout out to Adam for coming.
[24:07.980 --> 24:11.100]  Big shout out to my friend that helped me trim tonight. If you're listening to the podcast,
[24:11.100 --> 24:15.740]  short person with dreadlocks, you helped out a lot, saved me a lot of time. So I just dropped
[24:15.740 --> 24:19.740]  a bunch of weed into this edible. I just picked up scissors that we were using to trim to open
[24:19.740 --> 24:25.900]  this package. They're package compliant, dude. This company, there's an expiration date on here.
[24:25.900 --> 24:31.740]  There's a barcode on here. There's a made on date. And then inside, yeah, inside of here,
[24:31.740 --> 24:40.300]  this is like bulletproof Kevlar, fireproof bomb proof plastic. It took Fiskars scissors to get
[24:40.300 --> 24:46.140]  through this shit and they struggled a little bit. Fiskars are your lawn scissors, just to let you
[24:46.140 --> 24:51.980]  know. Now Fiskars are the fucking diamond tip trim scissors, bro. So I'm going to do read an ad for a
[24:51.980 --> 24:56.220]  sponsor while I struggle to get this open right quick. This podcast is brought to you by natures

[26:06.860 --> 26:09.820]  not shoving it into my face in the middle of a commercial. I want to get these done and then
[26:09.820 --> 26:15.020]  we'll go for it. This podcast is also brought to you by Hygro indoor growing supplies. Hygro indoor
[26:15.020 --> 26:20.540]  growing supplies has two locations to serve Colorado. Visit the Denver store at 8271 beach
[26:20.540 --> 26:25.660]  street unit F or stop by the new Pueblo location on 618 East fourth street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[26:25.660 --> 26:30.060]  Check out Hygro for competitive pricing and a great selection on indoor growing supplies.
[26:30.700 --> 26:37.260]  Make sure you check out www.hygrodenver.com. Hygrodenver.com for current store hours and
[26:37.260 --> 26:43.180]  special sales. Also, they're running a special. I don't have the paper in front of me. It is $550
[26:43.180 --> 26:47.820]  for one tote of soil. I talked about this last week, a tote of soil. That's if you pick it up
[26:47.820 --> 26:55.580]  at the store, it's $550. It comes in one bag. It's roots organic soil. It's good shit. How much is it
[26:55.580 --> 27:03.580]  tote? That is approximately in my measurements. I think that is about 28 or is about 48 to 57
[27:03.580 --> 27:09.260]  gallon pots. So you can run an eight light setup pretty decently with this one package of soil.
[27:09.260 --> 27:14.300]  If you need it delivered, it is $600. It comes on a FedEx truck to your house. So it's not like the
[27:14.300 --> 27:17.660]  hydro shop has shown up with a truck or anything. It's actually FedEx. It looks like you got a
[27:17.660 --> 27:22.380]  package that's fucking huge. Uh, that's going to be a lot of weight. So hopefully they can haul it
[27:22.380 --> 27:25.740]  right into your garden area or something. You're not going to have to deal with moving that.
[27:26.620 --> 27:33.660]  So check out our good friends at Hygro. I want to give a huge shout out to Jesse and Bernadette.
[27:33.660 --> 27:37.180]  They got married this weekend. Bern actually works at Hygro. So that's what made me think
[27:37.180 --> 27:39.980]  about it. They got married. They threw an awesome party. I just want to give them a quick shout out
[27:39.980 --> 27:43.420]  and congratulations at the start of the show. We're going to talk a little more about that in
[27:43.420 --> 27:46.140]  a few minutes here. You look like you got something to say, bro. I was just going to
[27:46.140 --> 27:51.420]  say congratulations. Yeah, dude, their wedding was awesome. So, uh, uh, oil slick is next.
[27:51.420 --> 27:55.740]  Shout out to oil slick oil slicks, a loyal sponsor. They've been a long time sponsor.
[27:55.740 --> 28:01.740]  Uh, I use an oil slick product every day, every day. There's almost one in every room of my house.
[28:01.740 --> 28:09.100]  I think one of the most used products in this house, uh, carb caps, uh, dabbers, oil slick pads,
[28:09.100 --> 28:15.420]  uh, and a rig and a torch. I need a torch sponsor vector vector torches. Come hit me up. Or if
[28:15.420 --> 28:19.580]  somebody has got another email for me, cause this one's starting to lose its luster. Email company
[28:19.580 --> 28:24.060]  wants to sponsor us. Let me know. Let's review your product and shit. And we'll shout you out on
[28:24.060 --> 28:28.140]  the show all the time. Enough pandering, uh, oil slick. Shout out to our friends at oil slick,
[28:28.140 --> 28:31.980]  oil slick tools to help you concentrate. Check out oil slick pad.com for more information.
[28:32.620 --> 28:35.340]  Uh, dude, go find our friends oil slick on Twitter. Seriously. I say that every time,
[28:35.340 --> 28:39.340]  but go find them. Uh, they're at oil slick pad, uh, send them a tweet and let them know that
[28:39.340 --> 28:42.860]  you're listening to the agriculture podcast. Let them know you heard this ad and that my
[28:42.860 --> 28:45.900]  advertising is effective. Let them know that you're paying attention and that it's working
[28:45.900 --> 28:49.260]  for them. I know right now you're probably in the garden. It could be driving in the car.
[28:49.260 --> 28:52.940]  Maybe you're on a treadmill. Uh, what do you do when you're listening to the podcast?
[28:52.940 --> 28:57.020]  Uh, usually game. I mean, while you're playing video games, slow game. So then you don't have
[28:57.020 --> 29:00.860]  your hands available to go and tweet me something. Right? No. I'm trying to remember it later guys.
[29:00.860 --> 29:05.260]  Just, just tweet us. I know I asked for a lot, but that's all I want to say. Simple tweet. Come
[29:05.260 --> 29:09.820]  on, man. Just pay attention. I'm kidding. Oil slick. Just, I mean, do they, they're constantly
[29:09.820 --> 29:14.060]  coming up with good glitter pictures just alone. I mean, I'm calling them because if you're dabbing,
[29:14.060 --> 29:18.700]  uh, the reason I have them as a sponsor is because I use their stuff because it's necessity. It's
[29:18.700 --> 29:23.020]  useful. If you're dabbing, you need some oils like products. You need something to keep your
[29:23.020 --> 29:26.780]  hash in. If you're smoking the live resin that we've got now, you don't want to carry it around
[29:26.780 --> 29:31.580]  in parchment paper. You want your live resin to be kept in like a nice smooth looking oil slick
[29:31.580 --> 29:36.620]  container. My red, golden green Rasta colored oil slick container on the table with my oil slick pads.
[29:36.620 --> 29:40.300]  It just looks classy. They got these things here with like the magnetic sides too, where you can
[29:40.300 --> 29:43.420]  just put your slab. I'm going to have to fucking Google that cause I'm not sure if that's actually
[29:43.420 --> 29:46.940]  their product or if somebody's making that a modified version. Cause I can't find it on their
[29:46.940 --> 29:50.060]  website, but they always look if you're listening. No, no, no. We're going to have to find out.
[29:50.060 --> 29:53.900]  Cause that's a good idea. You guys, if you have a miniature size slab, you can take two of these,
[29:53.900 --> 29:59.900]  uh, oil slick, uh, uh, mini pads, slick pad minis, and you can rubber band them together with your
[29:59.900 --> 30:02.860]  slab in the middle, or you can find other ways to stick them together and just have your slab
[30:02.860 --> 30:06.700]  right in the middle and make it easily accessible. Uh, they're great things. I actually use it
[30:06.700 --> 30:11.740]  almost as a, uh, I wipe my dabber off on it. That's why it's all sticky on this edge near me.
[30:11.740 --> 30:15.980]  Uh, so I take another dab, wipe it off on there. And my next stab doesn't have residue of my last
[30:15.980 --> 30:19.740]  dab on there. Every dab is fresh. And not only that, but I've, I've, you know, I've seen you
[30:19.740 --> 30:25.100]  use them to set pipes down on just for, I usually try to have it like a coaster because the tables
[30:25.100 --> 30:28.860]  would. And I think it's just a little better than fucking dropping my glass onto the table. Have
[30:28.860 --> 30:33.420]  that little pad underneath it. Not all the glass is heavy and thick, right? And my domes for my
[30:33.420 --> 30:37.260]  domed rigs. I know I don't, there's one dome drag on the table now that the dome sits on there
[30:37.260 --> 30:41.740]  because you leave a, I made an ad that said, stop leaving sticky rings in your mom's table
[30:41.740 --> 30:45.340]  because everybody's tables got those little rings. You could tell who's a dabber and who tries to
[30:45.340 --> 30:50.620]  hide it. Yeah. So that's a huge shout out to our friends at oil slick, uh, man, oil slick has been
[30:50.620 --> 30:55.100]  a huge sponsor. I totally represent that shit all day long. So thanks guys. Thanks for sponsoring us.

[31:06.060 --> 31:10.460]  shout out to tree thugger.com. This episode is brought to you in part by tree thugger.com.
[31:10.460 --> 31:15.580]  A live music lifestyle magazine. Check out tree thugger.com for concert festival
[31:15.580 --> 31:21.660]  news and reviews. www.tree thugger.com. Somebody was like tree hugger, huh? Sounds like you and
[31:21.660 --> 31:26.940]  I was like tree thugger, bro. This is the revolution. This is the revolution. I just
[31:26.940 --> 31:34.140]  got seven Facebook messages in a row. I guess the internet's back. I think your phone was not
[31:34.140 --> 31:37.900]  working earlier because the internet was down. I think that's what the problem was. Yes. The
[31:37.900 --> 31:41.180]  internet is back on. Yay. We might be able to read some news since the internet's back.
[31:41.820 --> 31:46.460]  I wasn't able to research much news because the internet was crooked. But, uh, so we got the ads
[31:46.460 --> 31:50.140]  out of the way. Much respect to all those sponsors. I do want to give a big shout out to our friends
[31:50.140 --> 31:56.060]  at natural mystic cannabis caregivers and Colorado Springs. Uh, Shelly, you're awesome. Uh, big
[31:56.060 --> 31:59.340]  digital hug to you. I'm not sure if you get to listen to the show, but either way, I'm sending
[31:59.340 --> 32:05.580]  you out a big digital, a thoughtful hug. Also Joey, what's up, bro. Thanks for, uh, that clone.
[32:05.580 --> 32:09.420]  I don't know if I should say that on the show. He didn't give me a clone, but man, thanks for
[32:09.420 --> 32:13.180]  that clone. I really needed that. That helps me out in a big, big way. Huge shout out to natural
[32:13.180 --> 32:18.300]  mystic cannabis caregivers. Uh, I think that's all the ads I'm responsible for this week.
[32:18.300 --> 32:23.660]  Uh, I've got this thing open. Uh, let's eat an edible. This is where we all started 10 minutes
[32:23.660 --> 32:31.420]  ago. Uh, this is six ounces, 168 grams of chocolate and peanut butter is what it looks like to me.
[32:31.420 --> 32:36.460]  350 milligrams, active cannabis medicinal product. Keep out of reach of children.
[32:37.260 --> 32:40.780]  Uh, the packaging is quite fancy. I'm going to read you the back just cause this is a really,
[32:40.780 --> 32:44.940]  this, they did a hell of a good job on the packaging. This is the outer box. Uh, this
[32:44.940 --> 32:50.300]  product is infused with medical marijuana and was provided without regular regulatory oversight for
[32:50.300 --> 32:55.500]  health safety or efficacy. And there may be health risks associated with the consumption of the
[32:55.500 --> 33:00.300]  product. Keep out of the reach of children processed in a facility that may contain nuts.
[33:01.180 --> 33:05.500]  I hope so. There's peanut butter in it. Uh, there may be additional health risks associated with the
[33:05.500 --> 33:09.340]  consumption of this product for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning on becoming
[33:09.340 --> 33:15.340]  pregnant. It's pretty much anyone in Pueblo. This product is unlawful outside the state of Colorado.
[33:15.340 --> 33:20.860]  The intoxicating effects of this product may be delayed by two or more hours. Do not drive a motor
[33:20.860 --> 33:26.540]  vehicle or operate heavy machinery while using medical marijuana. Uh, it's got a phone number
[33:26.540 --> 33:32.380]  and an OPC license like it should. Uh, the ingredients, uh, caught my attention, eggs,
[33:32.380 --> 33:36.540]  flour, baking soda, salt, cocoa powder. I'm reading all the whole fucking wrapper right now,
[33:36.540 --> 33:42.060]  but I've got a point. Uh, peanut butter, butter, powdered sugar, chocolate, hash butter, uh,
[33:42.620 --> 33:48.460]  0.5 grams, cannabis weight, 0.5 grams, dosage, 50 milligrams. So this is supposed to be a seven dose,
[33:49.100 --> 33:53.580]  uh, edible here is what they're, they have intended. I'm going to eat the whole damn thing
[33:53.580 --> 33:57.100]  is what I have planned right now. I've got a napkin. I got a drink. I think this is going
[33:57.100 --> 34:01.260]  to go down. Well, what's got my attention is it lists other ingredients. It has P,
[34:01.980 --> 34:10.620]  uh, 51.9% K 38.1% and, uh, 11 point. Sorry. I should back up nitrogen phosphorus. Uh, I didn't
[34:10.620 --> 34:13.580]  mean the wrong order, but that's, you know what I mean? Now those are the nutrients using the plan,
[34:13.580 --> 34:19.820]  uh, phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen, uh, calcium, magnesium, sulfur. I don't know what
[34:19.820 --> 34:26.380]  that one means. I should, but I'm, uh, I don't know the table of LLM. Yeah, you can't do it
[34:26.380 --> 34:30.460]  either. The table of elements, the periodic table of elements. I couldn't say it. I was reading
[34:30.460 --> 34:34.220]  these five sugar, malt extracts. So they list also what, what it was grown with and on the
[34:34.220 --> 34:39.660]  bottom here, organic neem oil. Uh, so they also list some of the stuff that was used to treat the
[34:39.660 --> 34:43.980]  plants. That's pretty interesting that they list that on there. So I know almost everything that
[34:43.980 --> 34:48.620]  went into this product that I'm going to eat, which is kind of, kind of nice to know. So let's
[34:48.620 --> 34:52.300]  get down to the fucking point. I'm going to put this edible in my mouth. I'm going to turn up some
[34:52.300 --> 34:58.780]  task rocks. You don't have to hear me chewing. It stinks like it. Uh, I bit it open. And as soon as
[34:58.780 --> 35:04.380]  my mouth, my teeth broke the seal. It smelled like a old school pot food. It really smells like
[35:04.380 --> 35:10.220]  cannabis. Like it's in a smell proof vacuum sealed wrapper. I can't tear this wrapper. I'm trying to
[35:10.220 --> 35:14.380]  open it up a little more to slide this out easily. And it fucking won't rip. It's bulletproof. You
[35:14.380 --> 35:20.140]  can make parachutes out of this shit. Greenhouse material. All right. I'm almost to the first bite.
[35:20.860 --> 35:29.780]  Oh man. It's great. Holy crap. So
[35:32.980 --> 35:40.340]  350, it's going to have 350 milligrams. I can taste all 350. It's delicious. Yeah. It's a
[35:40.340 --> 35:44.740]  chocolatey and peanut buttery. So is it, is it almost like an ice cream type of bar
[35:46.260 --> 35:51.380]  or does it have a softer texture? You know, it's not like hard. The top layer is straight,
[35:51.380 --> 35:56.980]  creamy peanut butter. The bottom layer is soft. It's like a, almost a soggy Brownie,
[35:57.620 --> 36:02.580]  but better. Alrighty. I don't know what that texture is. It's almost a fudge, like a nougat.
[36:02.580 --> 36:05.860]  No, it's harder than that. Okay. I want to give you some, but I want to eat the whole thing. No,
[36:06.820 --> 36:11.460]  I want to fucking experience this. As I said, I think they have these down here at the shop.
[36:11.460 --> 36:16.420]  And speaking of shops, uh, it's a peanut butter bar. So whatever they make a peanut
[36:17.300 --> 36:24.820]  mystic is dude. Publin is a step their game up because you know, their bud down there,
[36:26.500 --> 36:28.980]  I feel like driving to Springs. Yeah. We went to natural,
[36:28.980 --> 36:32.340]  mystic cannabis caregivers to pick up some shatter cause we were low on shatter.
[36:32.340 --> 36:36.420]  And we were just waiting for things to happen. And I took Adam, Adam doesn't get to go to a lot
[36:36.420 --> 36:41.060]  of dispensaries. I took Adam with me. Uh, he's been shopping at Pueblo shops. Uh, so natural
[36:41.060 --> 36:46.900]  mystic cannabis caregivers blew your mind. Uh, it's yeah. Uh, their bud quality, uh, there were
[36:46.900 --> 36:53.620]  big, hard nuggets of joy, you know, like they love those plants there. It wasn't, Oh, let's see how
[36:53.620 --> 36:58.340]  quickly we can turn this out. Uh, for number one, I think it was still only medical, right?
[36:59.060 --> 37:04.900]  Yes. That's only medical. So that's one of the, you know, one of the reasons, but then again,
[37:04.900 --> 37:09.300]  there's still medical shops that don't give a damn. This is a lot of chocolate and peanut butter.
[37:09.300 --> 37:12.980]  If you're like, uh, if you're actually sick and have like cancer or something, I don't know that
[37:12.980 --> 37:18.420]  this I'm not knocking the product. It's fucking delicious. I get acne from chocolate. Yeah. This
[37:18.420 --> 37:23.700]  would be breakout in it. Like while you're eating it, you get zits it's rich. I had a bag of M&M's
[37:24.420 --> 37:28.580]  it's supposed to be seven doses. And if that's supposed to be seven doses, I'm a good
[37:28.580 --> 37:32.740]  four doses in by now. Yeah. Yeah. And see, uh, that last drink that I bought,
[37:32.740 --> 37:37.300]  that's what I thought too. You know, I was like, I was like, I marked lines on it and I was like,
[37:38.420 --> 37:41.380]  and then I was down to here and I was like, Oh, well, you know, here you go. You're talking about
[37:41.380 --> 37:45.780]  the chai. Hi. Uh, it wasn't a shy. Hi. It may have been that chai. Hi. Was that what it was
[37:45.780 --> 37:48.980]  called? I think you showed me the bottle in a picture. Yeah. I don't even remember. It was
[37:48.980 --> 37:53.460]  so worthless to me. Our little trimmer friend that was here earlier, uh, who used to work at a shop
[37:54.020 --> 37:58.100]  she used to drink those and sometimes, uh, it would wreck her and sometimes it wouldn't do
[37:58.100 --> 38:01.700]  anything to her. She said, and it may have been, that's what she was saying. The lady at the shops,
[38:01.700 --> 38:06.580]  he said, next time try a fruit flavor. And that's what I wanted. I wanted it. They had like an apple
[38:06.580 --> 38:12.020]  cider type. And I was, yeah, I was like, yeah, that's me dude. All day. Um, Southern boy. And
[38:12.020 --> 38:19.060]  then they went, all they had was some cappuccino. And I'm like, I said, it was like watered down
[38:19.060 --> 38:24.020]  you who do, there was no cannabis at all. Like I just, when he said watered down you,
[38:24.020 --> 38:29.060]  who did anybody else think of the beastie boys song? Uh, professor booty is a song.
[38:29.700 --> 38:33.060]  Yeah. If anybody else knows what I'm talking about, tweet me about it. That'd be really cool.
[38:33.060 --> 38:38.260]  Just tweet me a hashtag professor booty. I grow culture. I'll send you stickers. Yeah. I'll send
[38:38.260 --> 38:43.220]  you an Irish genetic sticker or two. Yeah. Uh, I just like the interaction. I'm begging for attention.
[38:43.460 --> 38:49.700]  Um, this thing's delicious. It reminds me of, remember the little Debbie nutty bars.
[38:49.700 --> 38:54.340]  Oh yeah. It tastes like we're a peanut butter bar. Yeah. I buy those for the kids, dude. I'm
[38:55.140 --> 38:59.700]  yeah. It's like one of those, but it's better. It's better. It did a hippie made this, I would
[38:59.700 --> 39:04.820]  bet a hippie made this. This is one of those snacks. Uh, so I was going to buy another brand
[39:04.820 --> 39:10.740]  because they're delicious. Um, I'm reluctant to say the brand I was opting to buy that. I chose
[39:10.740 --> 39:15.780]  this over. I was going, I asked for a monkey bar because the monkey bars, I love a monkey bar,
[39:15.780 --> 39:20.100]  dude. I love from incredible. So shout out incredibles. The monkey bar is delicious. I was
[39:20.100 --> 39:23.780]  going to buy one of those. And the girl that works at the lady that works at the dispensary is a
[39:23.780 --> 39:28.660]  friend of mine and also a patient. She's a cancer survivor and she uses these products. And she
[39:28.660 --> 39:33.380]  said, I know you like the incredibles. They're a hundred milligrams. They're $10. This mountain
[39:33.380 --> 39:39.220]  medicine peanut butter bar is $11 and it's got 350 milligrams. So it's like three and a half of
[39:39.220 --> 39:44.420]  those for a dollar more. And, uh, you know, the businessman in me didn't take a lot of convincing
[39:44.420 --> 39:48.100]  to say, I just three for one, I'm going to do that. And I just handed her money and thanked
[39:48.100 --> 39:53.620]  her for being such a great person. Uh, the flavor so far, I am happy with my decision.
[39:54.660 --> 39:59.220]  That's cool. Uh, I, I know that I'm going to be wrecked. So we better get anything out of
[39:59.220 --> 40:02.180]  the way that we need to handle. You want to eat all of it? I'm going to eat all of it. All right.
[40:02.180 --> 40:06.020]  All right. Dear man. That's what I'm saying. Because you don't know high five and everything.
[40:06.020 --> 40:11.220]  We don't know if it got melted and all 350 ran to this bite and all three 50 brandy here.
[40:11.220 --> 40:14.900]  As you're saying, there's a, it's, it's almost like a different kind of chocolate. I would almost
[40:14.900 --> 40:18.420]  kind of imagine that it's, you see how right there, there's like a big splatch of that. That's
[40:18.420 --> 40:24.420]  like a chocolate chip or something inside of some peanut butter batter stuff. It's got the works,
[40:24.420 --> 40:30.020]  dude. It's a layer of, uh, semi-dark chocolate over peanut butter with this peanut butter
[40:30.020 --> 40:36.420]  chocolate. Uh, it's a thick moose, a light fudge sort of a texture. All right. It's, uh,
[40:37.460 --> 40:40.900]  I can eat it quickly enough. It does. It's not so peanut buttery that I'm stuck while I'm trying to
[40:40.900 --> 40:44.660]  talk, but it does take a little effort to clean up the face while you're grubbing it. And in the
[40:44.660 --> 40:49.140]  summertime, eat this in the air conditioner. Don't try to take this out anywhere. Cause she told you
[40:49.140 --> 40:53.060]  to kind of put it in the fridge for five or 10 minutes beforehand. Or she said, actually put it
[40:53.060 --> 40:57.700]  in the microwave or warm it up first. Oh yeah, she did. No, this would have been a, that would,
[40:58.100 --> 41:01.780]  I recommend that. Yeah. This would just be a puddle. She didn't say long. She said like
[41:01.780 --> 41:06.980]  one second, two seconds, you know, but yeah, I take a couple more bites out of it. I think going
[41:06.980 --> 41:11.780]  maybe, uh, just putting it in the refrigerator would be even better. Just was there a strain
[41:11.780 --> 41:15.140]  at natural mystic cannabis caregivers that got your attention? Cause they had some great looking,
[41:15.780 --> 41:21.060]  herbs. I smelled a couple of them. Uh, there was only one of them that I really knew what the smell
[41:21.060 --> 41:27.700]  was. So, you know, that was my only comparison. Uh, they had Harlequin there. That was, I haven't
[41:27.700 --> 41:32.340]  smelled that yet. And it was, wow. It was really potent. Uh, what was the, what was the other one
[41:32.340 --> 41:37.700]  that we got? Uh, or that you got that day that they had the strain there, the Torah Bora. No,
[41:37.700 --> 41:42.420]  no, not the Torah Bora. The super lemon Hayes. No, I can't remember which one they had. One that
[41:42.420 --> 41:47.060]  just stunk to high hell. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's the one I'm talking about. The one where
[41:47.060 --> 41:52.100]  that's what we got some of the shatter. Oh, the guava. Yeah. The guava. That really impressed me,
[41:52.100 --> 41:56.660]  dude, that she opened the jar and it was like a punch in the face before she handed it to me.
[41:56.660 --> 42:01.220]  And I mean, like I said, there was no small nugs in the jar and everything was frosty.
[42:02.020 --> 42:06.580]  Everything was right to that point where I feel like I could have brought it home and kept it in
[42:06.580 --> 42:11.060]  my jar for a couple of days. And it would have been like, you know, I could have judged where,
[42:11.060 --> 42:15.460]  how dry or how wet I want it. You tend to like, Adam tends to like his wheat a little crispier
[42:15.460 --> 42:19.540]  than most folks. Adam likes it a little drier. We'd like a, so we'll cure it perfectly and then
[42:19.540 --> 42:25.620]  give it to Adam to destroy for us. Yeah, exactly. But still it's, it's nice to have that option
[42:25.620 --> 42:31.380]  instead of you, where I'm from, it's always dry. So, you know, you get something wet. You're like,
[42:31.380 --> 42:35.940]  what is this? I'm all in now. I just put the rest of this thing in my mouth up. I wasn't
[42:35.940 --> 42:39.940]  shitting about that final thing filled with butter. Cause that last bite tastes like butter,
[42:39.940 --> 42:44.980]  not even like chocolate or pie butter. No like butter. Oh, just butter. Paula Dean made that up.
[42:44.980 --> 42:49.460]  Yeah. Um, so I've never had a chance to say this on like a public platform, but fuck Paula Dean.
[42:51.140 --> 42:56.420]  Hey, here, here. Um, no fuck her before her racism, but extra fucker for her racism.
[42:57.700 --> 42:59.700]  I'm trying to get this chocolate peanut butter mix in my mouth.
[43:01.540 --> 43:06.820]  One time, uh, so I had an Italian girlfriend and we would watch Giada De Laurentiis
[43:06.820 --> 43:10.740]  and Paula Dean back to back. And I think Alton Brown was on in the mix.
[43:11.700 --> 43:15.140]  Oh, sorry. I'm wiping my face. I got fucking chocolate, peanut butter, butter,
[43:15.140 --> 43:19.060]  all over the place. It's got, I could feel the butter on my lips. They're like,
[43:19.060 --> 43:23.780]  it's tastes like movie theater popcorn in that last bite. So Paula Dean, one day she's making
[43:23.780 --> 43:26.900]  a meal and she's like this meal got a little something for everybody. We'll accept the
[43:26.900 --> 43:32.820]  vegetarians, but screw them. They can go outside and eat grass. Uh, fuck you, Paula Dean. I'm going
[43:32.820 --> 43:36.420]  to go outside and eat grass while your show's on and never watch your fucking show again.
[43:36.500 --> 43:39.940]  I would go outside. Now I'm not going to go down that road in your podcast.
[43:41.540 --> 43:46.420]  I'm gonna go outside and smoke grass. I've never really done a fuck you on the show. I feel almost
[43:46.420 --> 43:49.780]  a little bad now, but fuck you Paula Dean. You suck. You're racist. You're not fucking rude to
[43:49.780 --> 43:54.980]  vegetarians. Um, so I do, I, I sent her a letter. I was like, I will go outside and eat grass until
[43:54.980 --> 44:00.580]  Giada De Laurentiis comes back on. Yeah. Didn't you, um, have a correction or something?
[44:00.580 --> 44:04.900]  Okay. If you want to get to the point, no, I, I didn't know that's cool. Whatever Adam,
[44:04.900 --> 44:09.540]  you can drive the podcast today, bro. Hey, I wasn't trying to drive the podcast. I was
[44:09.540 --> 44:12.500]  correction. You're right. You're totally right. Uh, I ate an edible and you're going to have to
[44:12.500 --> 44:18.020]  keep me on track. You're going to have to do that guys. We've been smoking live resin. Yeah. Uh,
[44:18.020 --> 44:24.580]  and unicorn hash, uh, and butt naked, also known as bear naked. Depends on where you are.
[44:24.580 --> 44:27.940]  Um, if you don't know about the unicorn hash, the live resin or the butt naked,
[44:27.940 --> 44:32.500]  you don't even know brah, that love resin, the love resin. That's it. You heard all that shit
[44:32.500 --> 44:36.500]  here first on the agriculture podcast. Remember it. You're going to ask questions later. Yep.
[44:36.500 --> 44:42.740]  We've got answers. A correction. I did an episode about veg growth at some point in the episode.
[44:43.380 --> 44:48.900]  I said, keep your veg plants on 1212. Don't fucking do that. I fucked up. I said something
[44:48.900 --> 44:52.660]  wrong. It was me being a man and telling you, I fucking said that wrong. I'm correcting myself
[44:52.660 --> 44:56.900]  right now on the air where I have the chance. I apologize. I am the captain of this ship and I
[44:56.900 --> 45:01.380]  almost drove it into the wall. I, and see now I feel kind of like an asshole because I forgot it
[45:01.380 --> 45:05.300]  was about that. I thought it was something else because I thought you corrected about that last
[45:05.300 --> 45:09.220]  week or the last podcast episode you did. So I know that was correcting my, now you're pointing
[45:09.220 --> 45:16.580]  out that I fucked up twice. Dude, just edit this shit out. We're awesome. No, we're awesome. Uh,
[45:16.580 --> 45:19.780]  no, I did. I, that's why I said I'm being a man about it. I could just be all, no,
[45:19.780 --> 45:22.420]  fuck that. We'll just keep talking like that. Didn't happen. No, we got to correct it because
[45:22.420 --> 45:26.900]  we're, I'm the captain of this fucking pirate ship right here. This is my ship that I'm driving.
[45:26.900 --> 45:30.340]  And I got to guide you guys into the right way, but we're all going to fail together. And I want
[45:30.340 --> 45:33.700]  you to win is why I'm doing a show. I'm trying to improve your growing, not fuck it up. Sorry.
[45:33.700 --> 45:38.020]  I'm trying to adjust the music test got a little loud for me, but I want to make her growing better.
[45:38.020 --> 45:42.180]  So yeah, my first mistake was, I don't even know if I said it on the podcast or in a personal
[45:42.180 --> 45:46.580]  conversation, but I mentioned the red light spectrum and I got it totally backwards. And
[45:46.580 --> 45:52.180]  then my second mistake was saying to keep your vegging plants on 12, 12, do not do this. Keep
[45:52.180 --> 45:58.260]  your vegging plants on at least 18 hours of love, at least 16 hours of light. Uh, 18 would be better.
[45:58.260 --> 46:05.620]  24 is what I do to be perfectly fair. You didn't say it like, uh, by the way, put your plants. No,
[46:05.620 --> 46:11.300]  it was at the end of your sentence at the end of your lesson, that the end of your ramble of
[46:12.820 --> 46:18.020]  how lights work. So it's probably high. Yeah. Yeah. You would definitely back probably been
[46:18.020 --> 46:22.660]  doing it, doing a show for an hour. So excuse me, I apologize, but I admit it. I fucked up
[46:22.660 --> 46:25.700]  and I'm driving this, but I'm just telling you from a listener's point of view, tighten your
[46:25.700 --> 46:29.220]  shit up. I'll be buying more of these edibles. All right. That's so good, dude. I've got this
[46:29.220 --> 46:32.980]  chocolate peanut chocolate, peanut butter is a pothead's treat in my mind. I've got it in my
[46:32.980 --> 46:37.460]  mouth and it tastes so good. I'm a peanut butter fudge dude from Sonic. This song that's popping
[46:37.460 --> 46:42.420]  up right now. It's called hashtag and you can't get enough though. Perfect. Cause chocolate peanut
[46:42.420 --> 46:47.460]  butter and you can't get enough though. Yeah. Let me know because I'd, like I said, I would
[46:47.460 --> 46:53.140]  have definitely been like, yo, 11 bucks. You'll be here over. Yeah, I know. You'll see what happens.
[46:54.100 --> 46:59.860]  All right. So we did a correction. I ate the edible. Goddamn. It's good. We should talk about
[46:59.860 --> 47:04.900]  Jesse's wedding reception. I want to give a big shout out to Jesse and burn. Of course, Mr. Witt.
[47:05.460 --> 47:12.420]  I got to meet Jesse's father. That's a character there. Yeah. That guy is awesome. He can party
[47:12.420 --> 47:18.740]  harder than you and me. And then if we cloned each of us and set them next to us, he would win
[47:18.740 --> 47:22.500]  the fuck out. He would doubt dab us. He would out whiskey us. And then he would look at us and be
[47:22.500 --> 47:28.180]  like, why are you guys so fucked up? Yeah. Yeah. He is a professional and he's a man to the man's
[47:28.180 --> 47:32.340]  man world. He's a champ. So shout out. It was great meeting you. I think he listens to the
[47:32.340 --> 47:37.140]  show. So big handshake, Mr. Witt. Uh, the wedding reception was great. The bride looked beautiful.
[47:37.140 --> 47:41.780]  The groom, uh, well, he was pretty awesome. So about halfway through the night, he decided to
[47:41.780 --> 47:46.500]  wear a young lady's wife beater for the rest of the evening. Uh, each nipple stuck out just a
[47:46.500 --> 47:51.060]  little bit and he's quite a hairy man. So it looked great in the beard. Uh, you looked great through
[47:51.060 --> 47:55.380]  the, uh, the start of the night, bro. And then once you've done to the wife beater, I threw up
[47:55.380 --> 48:00.660]  in my mouth a little bit. I think I just did just hearing about it. Uh, shout out to the garden of
[48:00.660 --> 48:05.940]  Weeden crew. Everybody showed up looking classy as a motherfucker. And I think if you say classy
[48:05.940 --> 48:09.940]  as fuck, that describes them perfectly. Spence looked sharp as shit. Maddie has always looked
[48:09.940 --> 48:15.620]  beautiful. Big Mike was fucking dressed to the nines. Uh, Joe even brought a skateboard to skate
[48:15.620 --> 48:21.220]  in this cool place. And then of course my, my homie sloppy look sharp as hell. Fung, we wish
[48:21.220 --> 48:25.380]  you were there, bro. I don't know if you listened to the podcast. Fung is out of town. We miss you,
[48:25.380 --> 48:28.820]  Fung. That's a somber note right there. But at the wedding reception, I didn't go to the actual
[48:28.820 --> 48:34.340]  wedding. Uh, the pothead crews I was calling us wasn't, uh, we chose to just go to the after
[48:34.340 --> 48:37.780]  there was like a wedding and then a reception and then kind of an after party that started about
[48:37.780 --> 48:43.780]  eight 30. Uh, once the kids bailed out, uh, we set up a dab bar and, uh, Spence from the garden
[48:43.780 --> 48:47.140]  of Whedon and myself with also the help of Maddie. And if I missed anybody, the garden of
[48:47.140 --> 48:50.500]  Whedon list of people, I'm sorry, I'm trying to do a podcast. I got like 9,000 thoughts in my head
[48:50.500 --> 48:54.340]  at once. I don't mean to miss anybody. I love all you guys at the garden of Whedon. So rocking
[48:54.340 --> 49:01.060]  Nana included and even honey. Uh, so Spence and, uh, Maddie and I were pretty much giving out dabs
[49:01.060 --> 49:07.140]  to the entire wedding party that was over 21 and stuck around after the, uh, the old folks and the
[49:07.140 --> 49:13.700]  children left shit. Some of the old folks got down better than the youngsters, but, uh, did we had an
[49:13.700 --> 49:19.780]  email? We had a regular rig and we couldn't keep up with the dabs that people were wanting because,
[49:19.780 --> 49:23.780]  uh, Jesse handed me his live resin. Uh, he gave me a nice chunk of live resin to dab out the
[49:23.780 --> 49:29.140]  wedding party. And he said, guard this with your life. So, uh, it was my job. I volunteered to go
[49:29.140 --> 49:34.420]  there and be the dab tender. So we set up a little dab bar. I need it. How better? Yeah. Yeah. Right.
[49:34.420 --> 49:37.300]  Yeah. And he's like, I know you'll fucking give out good dabs and I know you had to know how to
[49:37.300 --> 49:41.780]  manage dab. So dishing out dabs, I'm getting buzzed. I think from that, my head just swirled.
[49:41.780 --> 49:45.060]  That was pretty awesome. We'll take a dab here in just a minute too. We'll slowly watch Jeff
[49:45.060 --> 49:49.700]  degrade. I'll start melting here. If anybody's got that weed, if you've seen that commercial
[49:49.700 --> 49:53.540]  that that girl smoked and she fucking melts into the couch and becomes like Play-Doh, if you have
[49:53.540 --> 49:58.900]  any of that weed and or hash hit me up at I grow culture on Twitter. They're lying to you, dude.
[49:58.900 --> 50:01.940]  They've been lying to you. That was Photoshop. They don't have, she Photoshopped that chick.
[50:02.980 --> 50:06.980]  I want some of that weed, dude. That looks like some great shit. It's that pink stuff in that.
[50:07.060 --> 50:12.740]  And that, so I think we dished out probably seven to 10 grams of live resin last night to
[50:12.740 --> 50:18.020]  the wedding party. Some people kept coming back and coming back. We, uh, we probably broke the
[50:18.020 --> 50:22.740]  dab record for Pueblo County in one building at one time with a certain amount of people.
[50:22.740 --> 50:28.660]  I don't know what the fucking logistics were, but dude, we, we won. I'm guessing no team
[50:29.620 --> 50:34.180]  on an average day and people are going to shit their pants. I take 25 dabs. No problem. On an
[50:34.180 --> 50:40.100]  average day, uh, maybe 30 or 40 on a heavy dab day. Uh, I've gone to secret cups and we've had
[50:40.100 --> 50:45.380]  to judge 42 samples and I've done those all in one day and was okay. And went back for seconds
[50:45.380 --> 50:50.420]  on a couple. So I'm, I'm in the 25 to 50 dabs per day range, which I don't know if that's,
[50:50.420 --> 50:56.100]  that sounds like a lot. Um, and when you see the size of dabs, it does, it is a lot.
[50:57.220 --> 51:01.300]  So, and what's odd is all, uh, I'll wake up and I'll rock for a few hours before I take a dab.
[51:01.300 --> 51:04.740]  I try to do a couple of things. Like I try to get food and water in my body and fucking check
[51:04.740 --> 51:09.460]  my email over here. I get to dab at seven o'clock at night and you haven't taken a dab yet because
[51:09.460 --> 51:13.860]  it will, if you take that, if you get up a reasonable time, somewhere between eight and 10,
[51:13.860 --> 51:18.020]  you know, do your day, get some food in you, get functional, get your blood moving and don't take
[51:18.020 --> 51:22.580]  a dab till seven 10 in the afternoon or the evening you get fucking higher than you would.
[51:22.580 --> 51:28.180]  So yeah. But what I was going to say is I wait until like six or seven or four 20 lately. It's
[51:28.180 --> 51:32.660]  been too hot to get dabbed out all day. So you got to wait until fucking six and the sun starts
[51:32.660 --> 51:38.500]  going down and then by nine you can get dabbed the fuck out. Then I'll take fucking seven dabs
[51:38.500 --> 51:42.740]  per hour. I'll sit down and take six dabs in succession, you know, in 20 or 30 minutes. Yeah.
[51:42.740 --> 51:48.500]  You're shaking your head because I ruin you doing it. Right? Yeah. I just, uh, I feel bad for you.
[51:48.500 --> 51:53.060]  You know, I feel bad for your lungs. That's all. You know, I'm sitting here shaking my head.
[51:53.060 --> 51:57.300]  Imagine if I was doing bong hits of flower that much. But that's what I'm thinking though, is
[51:58.340 --> 52:02.740]  you know, I smoke flower most of the time, so it's not sitting there smoking, you know,
[52:03.460 --> 52:08.820]  10 bong hits a flower, or if I'm just sitting there smoking by myself, it's two, then another
[52:08.820 --> 52:15.220]  four or five hours later, two more, you know? Uh, so I get what you're saying. I, I go slower with
[52:15.220 --> 52:21.700]  the dabs than I do with the flower. So less, uh, your lungs probably, uh, your lungs are like any,
[52:21.700 --> 52:25.700]  anything I think. I'm a smoker too. So they've got a certain amount of inhales and exhales.
[52:25.700 --> 52:29.700]  Your lungs are going to give you before they start to burn out, just like any sort of equipment or
[52:29.700 --> 52:34.580]  fucking device or moving country. Anything that moves is going to break eventually. And, uh,
[52:34.580 --> 52:39.780]  if I've only got 72 billion ins and outs, I'd rather spend half of those on a dab than
[52:39.780 --> 52:44.340]  three quarters of them trying to smoke herb. Maybe I should just get half of those on oxygen,
[52:44.340 --> 52:48.740]  at least, but you know what I mean? I'm trying to, Hey, no, I get what you're saying. And you know,
[52:48.740 --> 52:52.980]  it's understandable. My vapor to smoke ratio. Hey, tonight would have been the night that we
[52:52.980 --> 52:57.060]  would have done that event at the, uh, the Mary Jane's and at the hookah bar. I want to give an
[52:57.060 --> 53:01.140]  apology to everybody that was excited about that. I myself was excited. Me too. There were some,
[53:01.140 --> 53:06.580]  uh, bureaucracy discrepancies and some stuff that happened and I'm no longer a member of the, uh,
[53:06.580 --> 53:09.940]  citizens for the responsible regulation of cannabis. I don't know if that even exists
[53:09.940 --> 53:13.860]  anymore to tell you the truth. I've backed out of that. Uh, just going to stick with being a
[53:13.860 --> 53:19.220]  breeder and a podcast host and doing what I know I'm good at. Um, I don't like the, I used to go
[53:19.220 --> 53:23.380]  to city council meetings and stuff when I was with another dispensary group. I don't like being
[53:23.380 --> 53:28.180]  in that realm. That's a little uncomfortable to me. Uh, I don't know. I'd rather just kind of,
[53:28.180 --> 53:32.980]  it's one thing going there when you have to, you know, uh, but when, you know, you're just
[53:32.980 --> 53:40.260]  volunteering, you voluntarily going there and it still feels like court. Yeah. Once you've been to
[53:40.260 --> 53:45.380]  court going in the courtroom type building, it still feels like court. They're judging you
[53:45.780 --> 53:50.820]  completely. Yeah. And they don't, I don't feel, I backed out of going to those meetings because I
[53:50.820 --> 53:55.220]  felt like I was a hindrance to the group because I'm just a cliche looking pod and I didn't speak
[53:55.220 --> 53:58.660]  any way. We had spokespeople for the group, so I just quit going. And you want to know the worst
[53:58.660 --> 54:06.100]  thing that I think about courtrooms is can't wear a hat. No. Yeah. Yeah. So you know, your long hair,
[54:06.100 --> 54:11.460]  you can't hide it from anyone. I can't hide my dreadlocks anyway. Um, but there's no hiding.
[54:12.420 --> 54:15.860]  So yeah, I was talking about the wedding reception and uh, we got way sidetracked,
[54:15.860 --> 54:19.620]  but that's cool. We're just having a fun episode this time. Side track, dab track.
[54:20.340 --> 54:23.060]  We're just having a fun episode. We're not going to try to do a whole bunch of stuff. I may tell
[54:23.060 --> 54:28.740]  you how I dry trimmed some of this weed. Maybe, uh, I'm just going to tease about that. Uh, the
[54:28.740 --> 54:32.500]  wedding was awesome. Uh, I saw a lot of people that I haven't seen in a long time. Uh, shout
[54:32.500 --> 54:37.220]  out to bullheaded, shout out to a con con performed without booger. I don't know why booger didn't
[54:37.220 --> 54:43.220]  show up, but he still killed it by himself. Um, uh, despicable dialects wrapped who else performed.
[54:43.220 --> 54:48.260]  I know I'm going to miss somebody. Uh, Jesse wet grabbed a microphone and wrapped. That was pretty
[54:48.260 --> 54:53.460]  entertaining. Uh, yeah. A lot of people did a lot of cool things and it was a great time.
[54:53.460 --> 54:56.340]  I'm going to put in the request for next growth lesson. Then
[54:57.780 --> 55:03.700]  freestyle, uh, all the music's fading out, get the music back. Let's get it going. Yeah.
[55:03.700 --> 55:08.820]  Uh, there it is. And the wedding was awesome. It went off without a hitch. Everything was fun.
[55:08.820 --> 55:12.180]  Everybody got home safely. We made sure everybody got home safe because they got kind of silly.
[55:12.180 --> 55:15.460]  Some people got a little bit goofy. Just want to make sure to give shout outs to the garden of
[55:15.460 --> 55:18.580]  weed and crew for running the dad bar. Like a champ. Shout outs to those guys for getting married.
[55:18.580 --> 55:21.940]  We'll get off the topic of them getting married. Cause I don't have a lot more left to say about
[55:21.940 --> 55:26.980]  it. Live resin. I keep talking about live resin. Everybody's tweeting me messaging me. What is it?
[55:26.980 --> 55:32.580]  WTF live resin. What the fuck? It's great. It tastes great. Right? Less filling. Yeah. It's
[55:32.580 --> 55:39.380]  like a very light, light love. I'm going to take a dab. Love resin. It's funny. Uh, I told, I texted,
[55:39.380 --> 55:43.060]  I sent Adam a text message saying, Hey bro, I got some love resin. What I actually meant to say it
[55:43.060 --> 55:48.020]  was live resin. And so he's been laughing at that ever since. That's what it is. I'm going to take a
[55:48.020 --> 55:52.260]  pretty chunky dab of some live resin right now. I've got some friends that were kind enough to
[55:52.260 --> 55:58.740]  gift me a little bit of live resin. Super awesome. I hit the torch or hit the nail a little bit less
[55:58.740 --> 56:02.180]  heat and make sure to use the carb cap with the live resin. I don't want to burn it up because
[56:02.180 --> 56:06.660]  it's a lot more turpy. It's more turpinoids. You know about turps. That's what mostly gives you the
[56:06.660 --> 56:12.980]  flavor. They're flavonoids and paleoids that contribute to that, but mostly it's the turpinoids
[56:12.980 --> 56:18.980]  that you want to taste. And it's a very clean. Yeah. You can see the cleanliness and the clarity
[56:18.980 --> 56:21.860]  in the hash. I think I might've talked about it a little on the show. Here we go. Doing a dab.
[56:21.860 --> 56:41.800]  Yeah. That was a dab of live resin. Here, take that part. Take the torch.
[56:45.040 --> 56:51.040]  Oh my goodness. Shout out to TaskRock for making super awesome nails and carb caps.
[56:51.040 --> 56:55.280]  Highly educated is not a sponsor of the show, but they should be. One day they will be. I just got
[56:55.280 --> 57:01.280]  to... Task and I have been talking. Shout out to Highly Educated. Sorry, I just took a mean dab,
[57:01.280 --> 57:05.360]  so words are complicated right now. I'm trying to say that you can pick up Highly Educated
[57:05.360 --> 57:09.520]  products. He did a little more bro. Sorry. I don't even have your dab ready. I'm over here rambling.
[57:09.520 --> 57:14.160]  You're good. You can pick up Highly Educated products at aqualabtechnologies.com. I recommend,
[57:14.800 --> 57:20.640]  if you've got a rig with an 18 or 14 millimeter male joint sticking out of it, I recommend
[57:21.440 --> 57:28.240]  the Dualitye nail. That's probably the way to go. It's going to fit. If you've got a 10 millimeter,
[57:28.240 --> 57:33.040]  there is a 10 millimeter domeless that works perfectly as well. I'm catching my breath.
[57:34.080 --> 57:37.600]  Get yourself a carb cap. Carb caps are the new shit and they're awesome.
[57:40.400 --> 57:43.680]  You don't have to heat your nail as hot. You start, you drop your dab in there, you let it
[57:43.680 --> 57:48.000]  puddle up a little bit. You cover it with the carb cap and it requires less heat. So you choke
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.920]  less and your dab tastes a little bit better. You'll need a little more heat next time, bro.
[57:51.920 --> 57:54.720]  That wasn't too bad. You got a dab, but a little more heat will be better for you.
[57:55.680 --> 57:58.400]  I was trying not to heat it up because of what you just said.
[57:58.400 --> 58:03.280]  Yeah, there's that. You'll find it. I usually heat it for you when you're here, but
[58:04.320 --> 58:07.280]  once your nail gets a little bit older, you'll need to give it a little bit more heat. It's
[58:07.280 --> 58:11.840]  something that you guys will learn once it starts getting too worn out. It's time to replace it,
[58:11.840 --> 58:16.320]  by the way, to tell you the truth. Shout out to Task. I'm giving him a big old ad. He doesn't
[58:16.320 --> 58:20.160]  even sponsor the show. He's just, Task is a badass. He's a pioneer for the community. He's
[58:20.160 --> 58:24.240]  done a lot of shit. He's a hell of a rapper too, we're listening to in the background also. So
[58:24.720 --> 58:32.400]  multitasker, multifaceted, ingenious man. Entrepreneur. Live resin. Are you ready for this?
[58:32.400 --> 58:40.320]  Live resin. Pretty much take a plant that is growing, chop it down at harvest time. It's
[58:40.320 --> 58:44.000]  been flushed. You've been flushing for 10 or 14 days. Chop it down. It's harvest time.
[58:45.760 --> 58:51.600]  Maybe a couple of days ago, he went through and pulled off all the big fan leaves. If not,
[58:51.600 --> 58:56.000]  hang the plant upside down to take off all the fan leaves right now. Let it dry for like,
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.560]  and you know, some guys are leaving the fan leaves on. I should mention that. Some guys
[58:58.560 --> 59:02.640]  leave the fan leaves on. Especially frosty strains. Let it dry for like three to four hours.
[59:03.280 --> 59:08.080]  Then chop it up into buds. And other guys are, this is one method I've seen and it varies a
[59:08.080 --> 59:13.600]  little bit, but this is basically it. Chop the buds off the sticks. So you just have buds and
[59:13.600 --> 59:17.760]  leaves. You don't have all the stems. You know, you got like a fucking five gallon bucket or so,
[59:17.760 --> 59:21.440]  whatever. Put that in a freezer. If you need to use bags, put them in bags and put them in
[59:21.440 --> 59:26.320]  your normal freezer. We've got a fancy freezer we'd be using. So freeze your buds, get them nice
[59:26.320 --> 59:31.200]  and frozen. They've been putting them in a deep freeze is what I've been seeing. Then it's ran
[59:31.200 --> 59:37.840]  through a closed loop system. I'm not there for that part most of the time. I'm not a hash maker.
[59:37.840 --> 59:39.200]  Dried and cured.
[59:39.200 --> 59:44.480]  No, fresh. You cut down the plants. Okay. Good question. I'll emphasize that again. You cut
[59:44.480 --> 59:50.400]  them down. You let them hang for like three to four hours and take off the leaves and then freeze
[59:50.400 --> 59:57.200]  them. That's all they hang to dry. Boom. Frozen, chopped down, frozen, and then blasted in the
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.480]  closed loop system, taken out of the closed loop system and vacuum purged really, really gently.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:09.360]  And I'm not the hash maker. This is the process I've observed and gathered from hanging out with
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:14.080]  all of my friends that are extract artists. All right. All right. That's the basics. Don't
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:21.280]  rush out. And most people, and I sound like an asshole, most people don't have access to the
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:25.760]  machine you need to do this. You're not going to have the machine. There are a couple of specific
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.240]  machines that you need to do this. There are only a couple of brands and I don't know exactly which
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:35.280]  two everybody would recommend to fight over. So if one of them wants to sponsor the show,
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.760]  hit me up. We'll start talking about your machine on the show.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:44.800]  So maybe someone close to us, maybe where would they even start to look once this, this develops,
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.720]  where would they look for it? Denver? Yeah. Denver's the only place I know of you can get
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.760]  live resin right now. There was, and it's gone now. So I'm sorry guys, but it was there. It
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:01:00.560]  went fucking quickly. There was Tangy live resin at the clinic. It was 250 bucks for three grams
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:05.360]  for one of our friends that bought some. I think that's $85 a gram is roughly what that comes to.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:11.440]  But it's, you got to thank your pan for the machine. Well, and it's kind of the hype. Uh,
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.440]  that's part of, I mean, how many people have you seen on Facebook or anywhere? Yeah. Right. And
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.040]  it's our crew pretty much. The Denver crew has got it figured out. The Denver crew is smoking
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.600]  the libraries and I'm not sure who came up with it. I don't have any, I think, uh, I think it
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:31.600]  was giddy up is one of the first people that I ever saw smoking live resin. I've seen it online,
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:38.000]  but it didn't look, I'm going to give giddy up. And, uh, do I even want to say the other people?
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.480]  So it's like giddy up garden of Wheaton, uh, maybe some greener side empire that crew. I'm
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:47.440]  going to give them credit for inventing the bear naked and the butt naked right here on the show.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:51.360]  Pretty sure those guys invented that shit. That was their idea. Giddy up was definitely one of
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.360]  the pioneers of that shit. And now that I've recovered from my dad, let me tell you. Wow.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:02.080]  Isn't that smooth? So the live resin, uh, people are arguing that it's not cured. So it can't be
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:06.160]  as good that the fucking weed isn't as good because it's not cured before it's blasted.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:15.920]  Is the taste not incredible? It is more flavorful than anything. If any, any, if an apple that I've
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:23.040]  had here, if an apple tasted like, uh, some dank weed, this is girl scout cookies. We were dabbing.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:28.240]  If you had a girl scout cookies flavored apples and you bit into it, you know how apples take a
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.160]  second for that juice to come out of the fiber of the apple and the drip into your mouth. Right. Is
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:37.920]  that what like a, if you had a Weedle, a weed apple, is that what it would taste like? That's
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.840]  what that is where compared to shatter would be like buying slices from a bag. Yeah. Like it's,
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.480]  it's already pre cut. It's got that air on the, on the, okay. It's not as we're not downgrade.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:53.600]  We're not meaning to downgrade shatter. We're just upgrading, upgrading the live resin. That's
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:03:00.960]  all upgrade. We got the upgrade. That's two D's to upgrade. Yeah. Yeah. Or a double dose. You're
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:05.040]  from the South. If you got two D's and upgrade buddy, you've never seen that movie. Somebody
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.920]  will get it out there and tweet it to you. I'm not even going to let you know. I hope they do.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:12.720]  Uh, you want to shout out your Twitter address? Uh, that's overgrow the gov had overgrow the
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.760]  gov. That's my buddy Adam over here. He's from the South. So excuse me the shit that he says.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:23.440]  Yeah. It should be changed to like Adam with no filter. It may, you know, that's pretty good.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.560]  That's Adam with no filter over there. Yeah. But who cares? We're just rambling guys. I hope you're
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:33.760]  having fun on the podcast this time. Um, I've been talking about maybe talking about talking
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.760]  about maybe talking. I know I was waiting for you to catch that. That's why I paused. Oh dude,
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:42.080]  one more thing. One more thing. I'm going to toot some horns. So live resin guys. I hope we
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.840]  explained that enough. We're blasting fresh frozen plants. Don't try and blast them. Fresh
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:50.880]  frozen vacuum purge it really lightly because the vacuum purge fucks up your terpenoids and
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:56.560]  it collapses a lot of things. Uh, if you're doing this process, you should know what I'm talking
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:02.480]  about. All the vacuum purge lighter and a little longer. Uh, just go lighter and longer. Less.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:08.560]  Don't expect to get shatter through the same process. No, no, it's not supposed to come out.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.920]  Some of it came out shattery. Some of it is what we're calling sugary. And it looks like we
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.680]  fucked up. It looks like old school hash that we fucked up, but it's almost clear. It tastes,
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:21.680]  it's hopeful. Oh my gosh, dude. It is. And that's, and I'm higher from it. It's a, it's a cleaner. I
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:27.360]  don't cough. I don't cough from it. I do. Cause I smoke cigarettes. So if I take, you know, I don't
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.200]  know if I could die from it. I don't know if I could do a half gram dab of live resin. Why would
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.280]  you want to though? Because I like dropping half gram dabs and fucking regular shatter. I like that
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.320]  they're like kicking the dick kind of feeling that it gives you. And I guess on my level,
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:46.240]  sometimes it takes a half gram dab YouTube video in the making. How much live resin is on this
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:50.720]  little sheet right now? I don't know. That's not even big enough to be impressive. All right. Yeah.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.080]  That's a lot of library. It's a fucking dude. $85 a gram at the clinic. Yeah. No,
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:59.440]  you want me to drop a $45 gram or a $45 dab. This coming from the man who has burned quite
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.720]  a few things that I don't even want to talk about. Uh, I'll post that picture up. I'll post a picture
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:08.240]  somewhere. He's talking about me burning things. It was a hundred dollar bill. It was the 4th of
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:15.760]  July. Uh, I'll post that picture one day somewhere. If that's not a crime, I reached, I was afraid to
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.200]  post it up because I thought that may, I may get in trouble for that. It's not, it's not a crime.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.720]  It's an actual form of protest. That's acceptable. It's a political protest. Yeah. Isn't that random?
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:30.160]  You guys, I burned a hundred dollar bill. There's a story behind that one. There's well, there were
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:35.840]  $200 bills. There's a story behind it. So it was a really good story behind it. It is maybe next
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:40.800]  year. I might have to edit that part out, but you never know. Uh, and we also said somebody's last
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:45.520]  name, but I may have to edit it out. Uh, I'm not going to repeat it. If you guys didn't catch it
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:50.160]  the first time, then you didn't catch it. Uh, so I'm going to toot my own horn, but also I'm going
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:54.320]  to recommend that you guys go and check out cannabis sativa, the essential guide to the
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:06:00.080]  world's finest marijuana strains edited by ST owner. The name is stoner. This is volume three
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:06.320]  released by green candy press. Uh, this book is $20. Uh, it should be released very soon. I'm
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.680]  going to go to amazon.com. I'm not sure that it's even out yet, but when it comes out, you got to
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:15.840]  get this fucking book, dude, because on page, I think it's 45 or 54. I suffer from it's 54
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:22.880]  page 54. There are some glorious photos of golden goat. Those photos are by myself.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:28.720]  Uh, took those pictures. Yeah. Thanks a lot. I'm just joking. I actually took those pictures with
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:35.120]  an Olympus. Uh, what's it called now? I can't remember the fucking little Olympus camera. It's
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:42.080]  not even anything fancy. It's a Panasonic Olympus. It's just a little, uh, 16, uh,
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:46.640]  fucking it's got a real good zoom. It's got a 16 X zoom on it is what's real nice about it.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:52.080]  And nothing took, uh, all the pictures in this we're taking with that cheap as a $200 camera
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:58.400]  from Best Buy. Yeah. So it's published in a book guys. Uh, that should be, uh, so thanks. I want
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.520]  to give a shout out to them. Thanks for putting me in the book. I also want you guys to look at
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:07.680]  the book, support these guys. They put out great, uh, strain guides, the description. Uh,
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:16.000]  I wrote some of it and then it was, uh, given some Liberty, I think is what I'm trying to say.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.720]  I didn't write that the way that it's written there. So, and I also am not taking credit for
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:26.720]  creating golden goat. I did not create golden goat guy named, uh, Mr. Dank from Kansas created
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:31.920]  the golden goat. And, uh, that was not me. I simply put it into seed form. It's in feminine
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:37.040]  seed. Unfortunately right now it's sold out, but there'll be more made. It wakes so fast.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:41.680]  Do you see you got golden goat seeds? I made a test batch and they went pretty quickly to all
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:46.480]  my test crew and they showed fucking huge potential and they looked like golden goat mommy.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:52.000]  So then I made more and I put them online. They were gone, dude. That's awesome. Yeah.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:57.440]  Shout out to nature's green remedies. Uh, those boys know how to hustle. Uh, so I was in the book.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.360]  Yeah. It's cannabis sativa by that book. Check it out, guys. It will be available on Amazon.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:06.800]  If it's not already, they do great work over there. The strain guides are important now that
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.920]  we're getting into the medical marijuana stuff and it's getting to be legal everywhere. People
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:13.840]  are going to want to know about these strains and they're going to be growing all this crazy shit.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.200]  And now we've actually got a book to kind of document it to the picture from sub cool on
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:25.760]  page 72 of Jack, the ripper. It's gorgeous. Excuse me. I've never sneezed on a podcast before.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.720]  It was the first time. Excuse me. Sorry guys. I didn't mean to do that.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:34.400]  Do my eyes got so heavy when I sneeze that that edible is working.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.760]  I forgot all about it. Honestly, I can't forget about it. I still have the taste of chocolate
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:44.240]  and peanut butter in my mouth. This is a cool book. No, there's some picture of East coast,
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:50.560]  sour diesel. Trust me, damn dude. Whoever grew that. Let's see. Uh, Illuminati seeds.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.880]  They, uh, Hey, it's also got some, uh, some of the other guys in there that La Plata labs
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.640]  picture. Oh, La Plata is in here. Do you remember which strain it was? Um, no, I don't. Their

[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:21.260]  see you're getting fidgety. Yeah, totally fidgety. Let's take a dab. Try to calm me
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:24.060]  down a little bit. You're like, let's go for a walk. You want to go for a walk? I don't know
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:29.980]  if I, yeah, make it far. We leave out. They'd be like, wow, that crash is really wet. No,
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:34.700]  I got your brother. You're good. Uh, so I said I was going to talk about trim stuff. We better do
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:39.660]  that. Cause we're 49 minutes in. Holy crap. Cause I dry trim. You need a long episode. You know,
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:44.700]  I understand. I get it, but you've needed one. You need to do them structured, but this was fun.
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:48.380]  This was a good, this was a good idea. I'm a high as giraffe pussy. I bet you are. That's
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:56.940]  a Joe Rogan quote, but I am there. You said, Hey, usually he is followed by a statement ending
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:01.660]  guys. If you're wondering what Adam looks like, all you gotta do is watch this cartoon called
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:06.780]  king of the Hill. There's a character named lucky. Oh my God. In about 10 years, Adam's going to look
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:13.580]  just like lucky. That's fine. You want to give a shout out to anybody?
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:17.740]  Dab. No, I don't really want to give a shout out to anybody. Uh,
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:25.100]  all I know is that this stuff that you're dabbing is, is 100%. And I want one of these next time.
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:29.660]  Because you do. Yeah. Yeah. One of those. Yeah, I do. And I damn sure don't want to split it with
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:34.460]  her. No, just eat the whole thing and make her extremely jealous. There we go. That's
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:38.380]  what I'll give a shout out to. I'll give a shout out to my wife because she's sitting at home while
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:45.980]  I'm sitting here dabbing. So good night. Not you guys. Just his wife. Yeah. Good night,
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:51.740]  Christie. I just dropped the torch. Oh, I thought that was a rig dude. That was a torch. My heart
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:55.020]  dropped. I did at the edge of the table cause it was hot. Yeah. I just had him facedown right there.
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:13:01.980]  It scared me though. One of these, that fat dab of live resin after how high it was from that edible.
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:08.060]  This is going to be a fun end of a show section. If it ends, Oh, if it ends, can we just podcast?
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:11.580]  I think definitely. I think we got everything. Yeah. We could do a live feed. Couldn't you ever
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:16.060]  a Google hangout and just then release it. You ever eat an LSD where you got into that bubble
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:19.180]  where you don't want to leave where you are because you're just like, I'm here and I'm safe.
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:23.820]  Yeah, absolutely. So that's how the podcast has me right now. I'm secure. I've got my little
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:28.220]  station right here. I got some dabs. I got a drink. I got a book to read. If something goes
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:33.420]  wrong, I got the internet. I got my little station. I'm in the internet's back. Oh,
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:37.740]  the internet is back. The internet was down here. A Comcast. Come on, dude. You're expensive. I
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:41.340]  wouldn't even going to say the C word. You know what I'm saying? Comcast. Yeah. They're so
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:45.020]  expensive. They should work. Come on guys. Get it together. It's not that they should work. They
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:51.500]  should work past 12 o'clock to four o'clock because unlike them, other people do things at those
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:57.020]  hours. Yeah. And it's like, you know, I'm not going to say what people do. I'm just going to
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:02.060]  say that people need to do that. Yeah. On the internet. All right guys. After I finished this
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:08.860]  cough, here we go with a miniature grow lesson on dry trimming and bear in mind, I ate a 350
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:12.700]  milligram edible that is highly effective. I'll get him to slow down a little bit. It's
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:17.500]  fucking working. Yeah. Adam will help us out. So I'll even turn down the music because it's
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:23.100]  highly distracting because I love these songs. Task rocks. Awesome. In my opinion,
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:30.620]  dry trim or rubber gloves for almost all of everything that I'm talking about.
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:37.500]  Get the, uh, the blue nitrile gloves. Those are, those are great. They're cheap. They got them at
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:44.140]  like Walmart and Walgreens. They're affordable. Woo. I'm high. Here we go. Uh, so, uh, pull the
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:47.740]  plant out of the room, I guess, and just chop it down to the base and then hang it upside down.
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:52.540]  I use, uh, that bottom branch, the very bottom branch where the first fucking set of buds are.
[01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:57.660]  I hang that over. Uh, sometimes you could string up a line across the room or maybe use like a
[01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:01.420]  coat hanger, depending on how many I've going on, but wherever you're hanging it, that's your new
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:04.940]  little hanger, that little Y that first intersection. And then I'll grab like a, uh,
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:08.300]  a fuzzy stick pack of fuzzy sticks from Walmart. It's kind of like a pipe cleaner.
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:14.780]  Uh, anything like that? Uh, fucking the thing around your bread bag. They got a bunch of those
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:18.300]  kinds of things, a little twisty tie sort of thing, wrap that around the stock and just kind
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:22.300]  of secure it onto whatever you're hanging it to a little bit, because sometimes that branch will
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:26.940]  break. If you've got a heavy plant, you want to go to the second branch, go for that, uh, secure
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:30.220]  it on there a little bit. I like to secure it either way, just cause I'm fucking OCD. I don't
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:35.260]  want my plants falling on the floor after they've been growing for fucking 125 days or something.
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:40.060]  Are you going to be all right, princess? You're turning colors. Hey, don't call me princess.
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:45.580]  You'd be lucky to talk. Yeah. Yeah. This, uh, this edible works. If you guys want to buy an edible,
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:51.420]  uh, I recommend the mountain medicine, your tolerance. Yeah. Dude, half of it, dude. If you
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:57.260]  do that, eat a quarter. If you were I'm high. Yeah. I'm a professional working for you. I know
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:02.380]  it's going to work for me. I like to say I'm a professional and this is fucking me up in such a
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:07.580]  good way. When I bought that 315 milligram drink, I thought that it was going to fuck me up. I mean,
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:11.340]  you literally told me I want one. I wish we could play some grateful dead music without getting the
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:15.340]  show in trouble right now. That's where I am. Hi. I want to listen to Jack straw. If anybody's a
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:19.420]  dead head out there, you know where I am. If I say I just need to hear Jack straw, man, somebody
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:22.860]  knows where you are. Somebody knows where I am. Somebody wore a fucking tie dyed shirt is out
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:28.140]  there going. Yeah, man. And they're going to play Jack straw for me. All right. So we got the plant
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:32.780]  and it's hanging upside down, right? You need to get off the fan leaves. Now's a good time to do
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:36.380]  that. Maybe you did that. Some growers do that a few days before harvest. Maybe I should have
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:40.460]  recommended that. Maybe a few days before harvest, go in there and take off all your big fan leaves,
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:44.460]  or you can do that right as you harvest, or you can do it as it's hanging up. Just get those big
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:50.620]  fan leaves off. Now your plants are hanging upside down in a room. You want that room at like,
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.420]  fuck, I should have wrote this down because I'm getting really high. You don't want a lot
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:17:00.700]  of humidity in there. Maybe like 25 to 30% max, maximum humidity. And then, and you want to have
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:05.580]  some air moving, but not like your fans blowing directly on the plants. That'll crisp them up a
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.020]  little too quickly. You want them to dry a little bit slowly while they're hanging upside down.
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:12.380]  So you got whole plants hanging upside down, minus fan leaves, just hanging upside down.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:17.340]  The humidity is kind of low. Keep your temperatures. You don't want to go cold,
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:22.300]  but you don't want to go hot either. So like 70, 75 is like, right, you know, right.
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:26.940]  That's a good area for them. We like what they like. Yeah. Yeah. Where you are is where they're
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:31.420]  cool. Yeah. It might hang kind of like in a work area where it's a little dark, keep it dark in
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:38.060]  there. And I would imagine it could go to possibly 80, you know, like 80 would probably be okay.
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:40.300]  Kind of crisp them up a little faster than you want, but you know.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:44.460]  Closet if you have to, you know, like that type of thing.
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:47.580]  Just make sure you're getting air to them. If you are doing like a closet or something,
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:52.940]  air because moving air prevents mold. Just remember that in every growth situation,
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:58.140]  moving more air prevents mold. That's like one of the, and growing is humid. You may not even
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:02.780]  realize how much water is involved in growing, but every gallon you pour in is coming back out
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:08.220]  somewhere and you got to move that. You got to get rid of it or utilize it somehow. So you got
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:11.260]  these plants that are upside down. They're in the room with the right humidity. They're in the room
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:17.420]  with the right temperature. Hopefully it's dark, right? As dark as you can get it. You got to
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:21.260]  dedicate space. You got a lot of air moving, so you don't get moldy. Now just let them dry up for
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.820]  shit. I've got some that have been hanging. The plants we trimmed tonight were cut down
[01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:30.860]  on a Monday. So they've almost been going for two weeks, hanging up there. And it's been a little,
[01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:36.220]  a little humid because we've had a swamp cooler going in that area. Not in that area, but in a
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:40.220]  room like three at a hallway down, I guess there's a swamp cooler in there just because that's what
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:44.700]  that room came equipped with. So we got to run that in a closed area. Yeah. But it's still getting,
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:49.020]  it still makes a little humidity in the rest of the grow environment. So where they're sitting,
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:54.380]  they're hanging for about 14 days is where they've been and they don't have any fan leaves on them.
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:58.540]  You might want to check them every other day, every day, like start checking them about four
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:02.300]  days, five days, six days, give them a little squeeze. And when those fan leaves or the little
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:06.380]  sugar leaves start crisping right off, just by hitting them with your finger, grab those plants
[01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:11.500]  and just take like, I've had these long bins and I just take branches off the, I have the plants
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:14.860]  hanging. I cut branches off and lay them into the bins. And once my bins are full, I go to a
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:19.340]  seated area. Cause you got to sit down to trim dude. Man, it'll drive you nuts trying to stand
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:23.180]  up. I'm getting old. That's how I know I'm old. I can't stand to trim anymore. So you got to sit
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:29.100]  down and I just kind of hold, I cut one butt off at a time and just knock the leaves off of it with
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:32.860]  my thumbs. Cause now that it's dry, those leaves are pretty much just going to fall off and you
[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:37.420]  can see what your finished product is as you're going. So trim it to your liking at this point.
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:43.420]  If you're selling it to fucking for stupid cheap a pound and just hustle and wait to get it out,
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:47.820]  don't trim it worth a shit. That's why cheap weed is cheap. If you want connoisseur grade weed,
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:53.420]  take your time and trim it and wear rubber gloves. Yeah, please. I don't want to smoke all your
[01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:59.500]  skin. If your weed's that sticky, then definitely wear rubber gloves and then have something to be
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:05.500]  proud of. Adam loves the finger hash. If you learn good rubber gloves, you can like rub,
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:09.740]  if you learn how to don't scrape the fucking latex right out of that shit, but you'll learn
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:14.460]  how to rub the hash off of your fingers and make like little hash ball or a little hash.
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:20.620]  Watch a, watch a video on making a, what was it called? You know what I'm talking about?
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:25.340]  No, I don't. Cause you're saying it. Oh, the hand hash. When Arnie goes and makes a
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:31.900]  charas. There you go. Watch a video on how to make charas and you'll figure out real quick.
[01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:36.700]  Yeah. So the buds are pretty much dry, right? We've got them in the room. They hung,
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:40.860]  they're crispy now we're hand trimming them. So cut off, like you got a bunch of sticks in a band
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:44.700]  and you'd take that fucking stick. You cut off a little individual buds and you just knock the
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:48.060]  leaves off with your thumbs. You can use scissors now if you want, but it's kind of pointless. I'm
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.100]  faster just thumbing it. It looks like you're playing Nintendo with the button in your hand.
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:55.820]  You're like, just going up. It should just take you a couple seconds to get each bud. And you can
[01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:59.900]  see, I, like I said, you can see the finished result. And what's really cool is if you wet trim,
[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:06.140]  you got to trim it and you're all sticky and it fucks up your scissors and it takes so long.
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:11.420]  And every time you set a bud down or touch a bud, it fucking sticky there and stickier and sticky
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:17.420]  here. A dry trimming is way cleaner. Uh, and this may sound weird, but as soon as you're done
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:23.260]  trimming, you can weigh your shit. Like this is how much I have. Yay. And it's done. And
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:26.780]  would the leaves not pull out moisture anyways? I mean, they're essentially,
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:31.740]  but yeah, it's ideal to leave them, you know, like they're, they're ducks to, for the place
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:36.540]  there, they're what's struggling to suck up the moisture, not the bud. Really? I would imagine.
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:40.700]  That's yeah, that's mostly right. But also it helps slow it down because you want the water
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:46.380]  to leave more slowly. Okay. And because that lets the chlorophyll evaporates with the water. So once
[01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:49.980]  the water's gone, you can't take away any more chlorophyll. But if you let the water come out
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:54.540]  slowly, then that chlorophyll dissolves with the water and goes away. Okay. Yeah. And it happens
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:58.460]  in the cure process. Also you start, uh, the gases start converting. We're getting into cure.
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:04.140]  That's different. Oh, go. Yeah. Yeah. We'll go there later. I, yeah, it's just, um, I can tell
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:07.660]  you now, like most of the videos that I've seen, I made it an hour and I'm high as shit on that
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:11.900]  edible. It only took like 45 minutes to kick in. I'm a little better now I've calmed down,
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:16.140]  but for a minute there, I was really high. Your hands are still like on your chair,
[01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:22.540]  you're holding yourself to your seat right now. Tell me you're a little better guys. Seriously.
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:29.100]  If you are not an experienced and don't try to be cool because I smoke a lot of dabs, you'll be
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:33.100]  that lady from NBC or whatever. Yeah, dude, you'll be writing a story about freaking out. No, you'll
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:38.140]  piss your pants. Don't eat 350 milligrams unless you're experienced because you will piss your
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:43.020]  pants. I'm being a bad example on my own podcast. No, I'm sorry. Like you said, you were, you were
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:48.380]  an experienced dude. You're in the comfortable ability of your own home. You got a homie here.
[01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:53.900]  You're good. Like you're, you're in the perfect spot to do this, to be like, I'm going to,
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:58.940]  this is no different than drinking a bottle of tequila. I'm not going to drive. I'm not
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:02.940]  going to go anywhere. Nope. I may, uh, I may troll the internet a little bit. Yeah.
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:08.140]  Until your spelling goes and then it's going to be like, who the hell is this asshole?
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:13.500]  That's about the most trouble I'm going to be tonight. Yep. Yep. You're good. Crap. So did
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:17.180]  we get through trim and weed? Cause I'm high. Yeah, you did. I think I always say, are we done
[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:23.740]  trimming weed? That's the worst part. You can tell how many times a grower or a person in the
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:27.820]  trim circle has been around pot by how fucking eager they are to trim. If you're like, are we
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:32.060]  going to trim tonight? I'm so excited. Let's trim. It's like your second, third, maybe fourth time.
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:36.220]  If you're like, Hey, I got to fucking trim a bunch of weed tonight. You're an experienced grower.
[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:41.820]  You've had a couple of crops down. Yeah. I still love it. I love it and hate it. I love it because
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:47.580]  I get to finally check out my babies. I get to see like, Oh, here we go. Get to fucking take those
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:51.260]  pretty flowers and blast them into shatter. No, I'm just kidding. I get to take all that trim and
[01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:55.100]  make shatter. And that's one cool thing about dry trim. As soon as you're done dry trimming,
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:59.420]  you can haul that trim off over to your extract artist guy and you can do his thing with it.
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:07.260]  I've cured trim before and blasted it. It was very, very unnoticeably different. Yeah. Couldn't
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:11.180]  tell the difference between batches. Some people say that's not the truth. If your weed's good,
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:17.500]  you know? Yeah. I cut down crops really if I'm making hash out of the whole plant.
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:22.220]  Sometimes we'll run, we'll run Girl Scout cookies, whole plants and just make dabs out of it.
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:28.220]  And I'll cut it down a little bit early, just a little bit early. I like to take it 63 days.
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:34.780]  Usually I'll cut it down to like 55, 56, right at the end of eight weeks. Like a mocha frappuccino.
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:40.060]  It's got that dirt coffee chocolate taste in there. Girl Scout cookies. Hash you guys,
[01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:44.060]  man. Let's put some music in the background again. I turned it down to give that girl lesson and
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:48.220]  talk and it disappeared forever. Guys, if you got more questions about dry trim and weed,
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:52.220]  please let me know. Cause I seriously am fucking high as fuck off that edible.
[01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:55.020]  What are you looking around for, bro? I'm just making sure we covered everything.
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:59.500]  I'm just helping you help you. I like you helping me. Thank you for helping me help myself. Cause
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:05.020]  you make a good copilot tonight. At this point, we have shot us a little trim girl that came over.
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:09.420]  I wrote that down. I might've said that earlier. You did, but it's all good. Yeah. She helped trim
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:15.420]  dude. She saved hours of the night. Lots of them. Just a good song. The song makes me think of, uh,
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:21.020]  Addison D'Amora fucking singing at one time. He knew like every, at the one point where it was,
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:25.020]  he like you're running video of this, right? No, I'm not running any video. It's a shame.
[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:31.980]  No, no. Yeah. It's definitely a shame. I'm a little late. Yeah. A little fun. I've never
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:39.980]  been this high on the podcast before. Do you feel like you could derail at any moment? No,
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:44.220]  no, I'm not. I'm not going to freak out or nothing. No, I'm just high. Do you feel like
[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:48.780]  you've died and nobody will tell you? No, but I do want to like take my mic off the stand and stand
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:53.820]  up and dance around and that's what you look like. You really, if there was a concert right now,
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:59.180]  I would be front row and my hands would be up in the air. Like, yeah, I'd be screaming. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:03.900]  I'm ready, bro. Too bad. It's dark time. And if everyone's in bed and shit, I'm sorry that
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:07.420]  everybody's so disappointing. I still be coming out on a Monday morning and everyone's gonna
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:11.900]  be like, what's wrong with him? He's all fucking sloppy today. Shut up. Shut up sloppy.
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:17.260]  Uh, it's been an hour, dude. What else do you want to cover? That's like I said, guys,
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:21.900]  if I fucked up the grow tip, please, uh, please let me know. Correct me. Cause I've said wrong
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:25.180]  shit before. And like I said, I'll fix it. I'll try to tell you the right stuff. It's not about
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:30.220]  correcting you. It's just about people not getting the wrong information. That's exactly it. That's
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:33.820]  it. Yeah. I want you guys to do it right. Cause I'm, like I said, I'm the captain of this pirate
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:40.620]  ship. The people that know you in real life, they know, they just laugh that shit off.
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:46.780]  He's like, yeah, he ate 350 milligrams and took like 72 dabs today.
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:53.420]  With an eye hard dab shirt on making eye hard dab shirt. Boom. I'm dabbed out.
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:27:00.620]  Not yet. Not yet. You're gonna take some more dabs. I'm not. You're probably, you can let's
[01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:04.540]  take another dab. There's probably just enough for two dabs of libraries and all this little
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:08.780]  piece of parchment. I feel bad for, we're smoking up all your life resin. Oh no, that's what it's
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:13.660]  for us to, to, to dab. It doesn't do any good sitting on a piece of parchment paper. I just
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:19.100]  want to, as a, somebody else sitting here at the table, I want to share the wealth and like,
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:24.700]  goodness man, you contributed to a hell of a podcast. Your close friends definitely deserve.
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:32.540]  So anybody out there listening to that is one of you folks, you know, um, well, let's skip this
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:37.180]  song. It's just a little skit. We don't need to listen to a skit on the podcast. That's awkward.
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:42.060]  Oh yeah. Uh, torch. There it is. We're running out of butane. We're going to have to switch to
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:46.780]  the email pretty soon. You came prepared though. I came, I got the email sitting on the table right
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:51.820]  here with the highly educated infinity nail rigged up, ready to go. It, um,
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:59.820]  it's impressive to say the least. Yeah. Yeah. It's only the second time I've seen it, but, um,
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:05.660]  from the South, we don't have no fancy shit like that. I had the bond. You mean electricity? Yeah.
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:14.380]  Uh, I had to suspect to the South only Adam. Yeah. Yeah. That's completely me. Yeah. I'm just
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:19.100]  Adam and his trailer park. I got a small town. Yeah. I got it enough for everybody. The railroad
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:23.420]  tracks behind his trailer park. Now this is the power plant. Oh man. Yeah. Is that why you're
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:30.540]  kind of mutated? It's it's debilitating is what it is. Do you get any government grants from any
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:35.820]  of that? No, you don't. Unfortunately they just want to like do a bunch of studies and, uh,
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:43.020]  research, you know, but, uh, we, we, no, I, like I said, I've had the bong for the past 10 years
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:47.980]  or so. You know, everybody would come around to smoke my dual chamber water, ice cold bong.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:54.940]  They just, it was amazing. I've never seen it. How much did you pay for that? $400? No, man.
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:59.100]  A lot of the people that are coming here to buy the rec weed or straight up from the South.
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:03.260]  They drive all the way out here on a weekend, Florida, pick up the same damn thing. I'm telling
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:08.300]  you right now, I just driving from fucking Florida to Colorado. Now there's medical and
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:13.100]  in other States. Um, yeah, but you can't go there and get it as easily. You know what I'm saying?
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:18.780]  Like you have to prove residency, you know, that if you're in, sorry, I'm totally interrupting you
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:22.540]  because I'm high and rude. If you're in Pueblo, Colorado, and you're on the very South end of
[01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:29.260]  Pueblo at a mile marker exit 91, uh, hit that exit. And then as you come off the exit, you need
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:35.980]  to go North just a little bit from the exit. Uh, and there is the greener side dispensary and
[01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:43.100]  there's a certain time period, uh, in the early evening, right as the sun sets, the led UFO lights
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:48.620]  come on in the greenhouse to keep the plants from flowering early into the bloom season, uh, from
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:56.140]  about a mile and a half away, this fucking 120 by 30 foot greenhouse, I think it is illuminates
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:30:01.420]  this purple blue spectrum. And if you don't know what it is, it is the craziest looking fucking
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:05.580]  thing ever, dude. It was all lit up last night when I was out there. That's crazy. I was just
[01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:11.100]  driving past, but I was on I-25. And as you look over like, what the fuck, it looks like aliens
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:17.260]  are landing, bro. That would be a cool thing to like, fucking really fucking record, take her out.
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:22.460]  What the fuck is that? So just go to the greener side dispensary and buy yourself. Hey, there you
[01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:27.180]  go. Fucking recreational cannabis. It's on there. Open to like 11 o'clock. So you can go out there
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:33.340]  around seven, seven 30 and five. I don't recommend that, but yeah, you could probably call them and
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:36.140]  ask them what time the UFO lights come on and tell them that you want to come check out the
[01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:39.340]  purple greenhouse. And they'll probably tell you what time those turn off. Cause I, they changed,
[01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:42.780]  they're, you know, they're just a greenhouse. So the schedule is going to change. They're just
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:46.940]  trying to do it to keep the plants, uh, come visit into flower early. We're fun people. There's tons
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:53.180]  of fun stuff to do here. We're going to Frisbee golf park. Look out disc golf disc golf. Are any
[01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:58.140]  good? No, I've never played in my, I miss, I miss why I went out there and got really high. That's
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:02.060]  pretty much the point. Yeah. That's pretty much the point. Chase the Frisbee and fucking smokes
[01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:05.420]  and balls. And they were like, dude, if you just bring a couple of joints, I'm sure. And I went
[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:08.540]  out there and I was like, I got joints. And they're like, nah, dude, we don't, we don't want
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:14.940]  your weed. And I'm like, I don't blame you. They had a lot better weed than I did. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:19.500]  Who were these guys? No, I'm just kidding. Back in fucking Tennessee. I don't know.
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:24.060]  Tennessee stoners. Yeah. It sounds like everybody had better weed than you in Tennessee.
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:29.100]  Everybody had better weed than me in Tennessee. Welcome to shout out to Loke
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:35.340]  and your shitty weed for years and years in Tennessee. Yeah. There's like 50 guys in
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:38.940]  Tennessee going here. You just gave me a shout out. No, no, no. All right.
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:46.700]  Huh? So that's that. Did you take a dab or did I just take one and be stingy? I don't
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:49.820]  fucking know. If there's some left here, that means I didn't share it. Yeah. There's a little
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:55.660]  left here. Oh, I didn't even see you take one. Yeah. I took it dude. That's you. Yeah. You put
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:32:00.140]  it down like it was nothing. I took a dab because it's the diverse clean. I must have
[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:07.420]  you sure. You didn't just like drop off the side of your computer. I'm like 137%. Sure.
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:13.260]  Which is that's all right. That's a big percent. Yeah. I don't know if that exists. There's some
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:17.180]  accountant out there pulling his hair out right now going, fuck you. You can't have 137%.
[01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:22.060]  Then again, they don't come to the agriculture podcast for statistics. They haven't,
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:23.980]  they haven't seen how many grams per watt I pull.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:31.100]  Hey, keep listening to the podcast and you'll, you might grow yourself and find out. Oh,
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:36.220]  oh yeah. Yeah. Grams per watt. I heard this girl say, uh, she can pull two plus pounds of Kong per
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:42.700]  thousand watt light. She was using a four by eight, uh, fucking botanic hair trays on tables,
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:48.700]  like elevated, uh, with fucking lights. Every 5,000 watt lights, every five feet and rows of
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:53.580]  five lights. Yeah. That's a lot of details for the six room, but she's claiming that she applied.
[01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:57.180]  I'm not doubting her, but she was saying that she pulls fucking two plus pounds of Kong per
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:33:03.420]  fucking cycle. Just to be funny. A lot of details would have been like address when she's going to
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:10.060]  be there. That would have been, that's a fat pool. If she's doing that props. Yeah. Hey, but then
[01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:18.460]  again, coming from east and just watching videos, the only place you can watch videos of that nature
[01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:26.860]  forums and YouTube and stuff like that. A lot of people sometimes exaggerate and I'm not saying she
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:32.620]  is. I've seen some pictures that may, that may do her juice. I want to see pictures. You may have
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:37.740]  just eyes. I need to, she needs to send me the dick pics. You mean of the dick plants? Yeah. Not
[01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:42.140]  like actually some dick pics because this is the internet age. And if you go on a podcast saying
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:47.100]  someone needs to send me some dick pics within fucking 44 seconds of this being released,
[01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:51.740]  your Twitter is going to go and you're going to get dick pics. Hey, you know what? You'll ask
[01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:55.580]  for followers. You'll ask for support for your family with cancer and people will ignore you.
[01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:59.900]  You ask for a dick pic on a podcast. Fucking everybody in America is going to flash you a
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:07.020]  dick pic. Hey, fast. You let me ask for what I want to ask for. Okay. As long as you
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:14.860]  fucking clearly give you everything to you. Oh man, guys. If you're checking out the agro
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:20.700]  culture podcast, Twitter, please. Uh, yeah. Refrain from the cockpits. Yeah. Yeah. Refrain.
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:26.380]  I like pictures of fat buds. I'll go home and I'll make my wife's a Twitter account and you
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:33.740]  can send her cockpits. She likes the penis. Pretty sure that's the first. She likes the
[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:37.980]  penis reference on the podcast. I'm surprised it wasn't from Wade. Hey,
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:43.980]  it's a pretty dope task. Rock song. It bumps. It gets going. Is it time to end the podcast?
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:47.660]  We've been going at it for an hour and 13 minutes. You got anything cool to say? Your podcast? You
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:50.940]  wanted to hang out and do a random episode. So I wanted to fucking kind of roll with that. I
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:54.220]  don't know if we got enough random man. It feels random. I feel like I fucked up a girl lesson.
[01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:59.260]  People count on me and I'm super high. So well ask for details. So what do we do after we, you
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:01.820]  got the leaves bucked off, you throw them in a bucket and let them sit there for a couple of
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:06.060]  days to crisp up. And then after that, you put them in a jar and start curing. That's from there
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:11.340]  is curing. And uh, I don't know if I want to get into curing yet. That's I want to talk about that
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:15.580]  when I'm not wrecked. So I'm going to write that down and fucking in two or three episodes from
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:21.420]  now, guess what we'll do. Curing cure some weeds. That's right. I mean, that's a, I know we went way
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:25.020]  out of order because we're only in veg and that actual lessons, but I was trimming weed tonight.
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:28.700]  So it was crispy in my room. A lot of people don't even know, you know what I'm saying? They
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:32.620]  literally think you dry it and that's it. That's got to get cured a little bit from now. I mean,
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:37.180]  you could, I understand that you could, if you're sending it out of town, right? But if you're going
[01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:40.220]  to smoke yourself or with your homies or use it for medical purposes, we got to cure it right now.
[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:45.820]  You want to be proud of it. You know, Holy crap, that edible is bubbling up in my stomach and made
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:52.860]  me burp all kinds and it tastes like fucking weed and fucking peanut butter. Yeah. All right.
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:57.900]  Well, let's end this podcast up while we're still all sane, by the way, I ate 350 milligrams of
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:01.580]  cannabis edibles and I'm okay, but I don't recommend that you do that. I can't advocate
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:06.460]  that type of use. I recommend this package says 50 milligrams. I'm going to say, start with 25 or 50
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:12.220]  milligrams. I dared you to do it. So it was the dare you had to do it. I just know I'm fucking
[01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:16.620]  them, but I'd done it without your dare. I like to eat a lot of edibles. This thing got me high.
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:27.100]  Good. It comes in waves. Is it worth $11? To me? Yes. It depends. See, that's hard to say because
[01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:30.780]  some people like their spending habits are different. Yeah. Like where you choose to put
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:35.660]  your money. I can understand that. This is a weird rant, but my mom will say everything is expensive.
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:39.820]  How much is it? It's two pennies. God, that's so expensive. She's from back in the day when
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:45.020]  that was a quarter of a penny. So now it's a fucking, she just sees it as, oh my God. So it's
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:49.420]  going to your, but for me that was well worth 11 bucks is my fucking really short answer of a lot
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:56.940]  of long words. I'm just saying usually things on that level are a lot more. Well, an edible, yeah,
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:37:00.220]  an edible is 10 to 15 bucks, maybe 20 bucks or something really potent. If you're going to a
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:03.340]  concert or something and you want to get fucking high as fuck and not have to worry about smoking
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:07.260]  through it, because that's why I like edibles. I go to a comedy show and you can't smoke at the
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:11.580]  comedy works. They will throw you the fuck out and you're highly visible in there. That place is
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:15.820]  tiny. Yeah. So eat a fat edible and just sit in there and grin like a tard the whole night.
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:20.140]  Fucking this would be beautiful for that. Someone likes to say pregame.
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:26.060]  Yeah. Eat it about a fucking North end of Denver. If you're driving up from Pueblo,
[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:29.260]  I can eat that fucker. Stop and get gas at that one gas station. There you go.
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:33.980]  Whatever. Eat that fucker in the parking lot and then get back on the road. And by the time you
[01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:38.380]  get to comedy works, you'll have a smile on your face. That's good. Or wherever you're going in
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:42.940]  Denver. That's just my, but this was, yeah, it was worth 11 bucks. So if you're going to,
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:46.540]  I was going to go, at least I want to go up there and get some weed. And then you know what,
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:52.140]  that $11 included tax, right? Their dispensary includes tax. So 11 bucks flat out the door.
[01:37:52.860 --> 01:38:00.060]  That is great. If you're like fucking vegan or something, I don't know what their option
[01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:03.660]  is for you because that's super chocolatey. And if you're diabetic, you're going to have
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:07.660]  to be careful with that. But of course you're not supposed to eat seven doses all at once.
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:14.540]  Like I did. That's got me rambling everything in moderation. I guess go big or go home on the
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:19.180]  agriculture podcast. That's right. All right, guys. I really want to thank you guys for listening to
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:23.580]  me ramble. Uh, I ate the fucking edible, so I'm going to go find something super entertaining to
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:27.820]  do with myself now. Once again, thanks to all the sponsors. Thanks to natural, mystic cannabis
[01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:31.820]  caregivers, big high five across the table to Adam for coming and doing a fucking hour and a half
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:35.660]  long podcast with me. It's quite entertaining. Sorry for dragging it on dude. It's awesome.
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:40.220]  The fucking, if you're having fun, they're having fun. I'm having fun. I got task rock in my right
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:43.980]  ear quite loud. It's not as loud as everybody else. Here's it. I got it bumped up a little
[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:50.380]  more on my headphones. I got it going on over here. Yeah. But, uh, guys go leave some comments.
[01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:56.460]  Uh, you know that I love fucking comments on Facebook, uh, on iTunes, on Twitter, on Instagram,
[01:38:56.460 --> 01:39:00.300]  on stitcher. Uh, I didn't read any comments this time. I didn't even check to see if they were
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:06.700]  there. We're just trying to have fun. Um, yeah. So now that the show's over, go to iTunes. Oh yeah.

[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:57.320]  Let me tell you the name of the song
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:58.200]  that we're listening to.
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:02.440]  That was the Summit Turnup 2014 Electric Dance Hall Music,
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:06.600]  Volume 1 Live on DJ Nikiti's SoundCloud page.
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:09.040]  There's a fucking sweet shot of DJ Nikiti
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.160]  DJing at Red Rocks.
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:12.120]  He looks stylish in that shot, brother.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:14.760]  Much respect, thanks for letting me play your stuff.
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:16.840]  So let's get down to this news article.
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:19.200]  Excuse me, my voice is of course raspy from dabbing.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.440]  That's par for the course, right?
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:25.160]  So it says, tougher rules on Colorado marijuana edibles
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.960]  for serving size and child safety.
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:31.200]  This article is by Eric Gorski from the Denver Post.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.800]  It says, Colorado's recreational marijuana
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:35.800]  edible manufacturers face tougher rules
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:39.000]  on potency, serving size and packaging of their products
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.840]  under stopgap rules adopted by state regulators Thursday.
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:46.040]  The new guidelines crafted in response to concerns
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:48.600]  about overconsumption by inexperienced consumers
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:50.760]  will do away with bite-sized products
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:54.600]  that pack in 100 milligrams of the psychoactive chemical THC,
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.760]  the maximum allowed by state law.
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:00.160]  Products may contain up to 100 milligrams of THC,
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:02.200]  but they must be easily broken off into pieces
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:04.760]  that have 10 milligrams or fewer.
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:07.680]  This is the standardized edible serving size under state law.
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:10.760]  So now we've standardized apparently 10 milligrams
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:13.520]  is a serving of edible cannabis.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:14.920]  So if you buy a 100 milligram bar,
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:18.720]  they want it easily divisible in 10 pieces.
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:20.280]  I shouldn't say names of products,
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.320]  but you know how a Kit Kat
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:23.680]  is already kind of separated into servings?
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.040]  That's kind of how I see they could do it.
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.520]  And sorry, Kit Kat that I used you,
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:28.720]  but your serving shit is perfect for my example.
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:29.800]  Or Hershey's bar has got,
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.560]  they're already divided perfectly.
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.920]  So that's what they're gonna require of all of these pieces.
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:35.800]  And I got to say that,
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:38.920]  that edible that I ate on the show was 350 milligrams.
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:40.320]  It was small.
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:41.800]  I'm trying to measure it in my head
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:44.480]  to have something to compare it to,
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:45.600]  but it was quite tiny.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.120]  Man, I don't have anything in my range
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:50.840]  that is about the same size.
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:55.160]  It was about the size of the top of a pill bottle cap.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:58.240]  Like that cap on your pill bottle was about that big,
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:46:59.840]  like an inch and a half by an inch and a half.
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.160]  And it was slightly thick,
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:05.160]  but the thing was there was no way to judge.
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:06.680]  You could break it in half, I guess,
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:08.480]  and kind of eyeball it,
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.560]  but there was no way to really judge the size
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.640]  of that sort of an edible.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:14.440]  So they're gonna make it to where they have
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:16.040]  to be easily broken up.
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:18.000]  And then that way you eat 10 milligrams
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.000]  instead of trying to guess and instead of getting wrecked.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.160]  But anyway, in another change,
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:25.040]  manufacturers will be required to put single serving edibles
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.320]  and child resistant packaging
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:27.720]  before shipping them to stores
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:30.680]  instead of relying on stores to provide the packaging
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:33.120]  as customers leave with their purchases.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.040]  So I think that means more costs also,
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:37.440]  that's gonna go up because the manufacturer
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.920]  now has to pay for that.
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:42.280]  And then that's just gonna get moved right on down the line
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:43.120]  to the dispensary.
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:45.360]  And that's gonna get pushed right on down the line to you
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.800]  because now you're able to bring in,
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:49.120]  they give you this big white,
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.660]  it looks like a money envelope, kind of like a bank bag,
[01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:54.600]  but it's got a child resistant zipper thing on it.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:56.080]  It's got like a clasp on the zipper
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:58.440]  that you have to know how to open.
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:47:59.520]  And if you bring that,
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:01.520]  you can put all of your edibles and stuff in there
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:04.320]  and they let that count as your childproof container.
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.560]  And you actually, you can buy those
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:08.440]  or they charge you for them at a lot of the dispensaries.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:09.720]  So they're just gonna go put that
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:10.880]  right on the product already.
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:12.880]  You're gonna pay a little more.
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:15.480]  But I guess a couple of bucks to keep kids safe
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:16.480]  is what we got to do.
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:18.680]  And then you get into the argument of what about parenting?
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:21.840]  It's not all about the products, it's about the parenting,
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:23.820]  but that's another argument.
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:26.320]  Probably a whole nother podcast that talks about that.
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:28.280]  So the rules, this one says the rules,
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.520]  which still must be made permanent
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.560]  in a process that will include public comment
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.720]  will go into effect November 1st.
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:36.360]  They grew out of meetings with health officials,
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:38.000]  regulators, industry representatives,
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.840]  and activists on both sides.
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:43.280]  The Marijuana Enforcement Division's primary concern
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:45.000]  is to ensure public safety.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.440]  Atreese Bryant, a spokeswoman for the Department of Revenue
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:48.760]  wrote in an email,
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:50.520]  "'Marijuana Enforcement Division feels
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:52.940]  "'that clear serving size requirements within the industry
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:55.480]  "'is a vital part of responsible regulation.'"
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:59.880]  Rachel O'Brien, a founding member of Smart Colorado,
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:01.880]  which supports tighter restrictions on marijuana
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:04.160]  said the rules are a step in the right direction,
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:06.780]  but time will tell whether they go far enough.
[01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:09.200]  "'Edibles manufacturers responding to public demand
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:11.080]  "'already shifted to lower potency edibles
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:13.800]  "'since recreational sales began January 1st,'
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:16.460]  "'said Mike Elliott, executive director
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:18.280]  "'of the Marijuana Industry Group.
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:21.000]  "'The free market has largely addressed this problem,'
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.520]  "'he said.'"
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:23.720]  Well, I kind of agree.
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:26.120]  That 350 milligram edible that I ate,
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:28.320]  it fucked me up and I'm a professional pot smoker.
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:29.740]  I take dabs all day.
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:33.200]  I wake and bake on a regular basis.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:35.100]  You know, I'm not bragging about how much I smoke
[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:37.220]  or anything, but I get down.
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:39.520]  I'm smoking live resin right now.
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:42.180]  I probably took a couple of half gram dabs today.
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:44.660]  And that edible wrecked me.
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:48.080]  So if somebody, if a normal civilian got ahold of that thing
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:49.960]  and ate the whole thing, they'd be destroyed
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:52.200]  and they would have a miserable experience.
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:55.040]  So I think clearly marking it is key.
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:56.180]  That's a great idea.
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:49:59.800]  We all remember the story of the lady from New York,
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:01.880]  Maureen O'Dowd, that ate too much edibles
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:04.040]  and thought she was fucking turning herself inside out
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:05.920]  and dying in her hotel room.
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:08.480]  Nobody wants to be that guy.
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:10.080]  Well, guys, I think that's enough news for the day.
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:11.920]  I just kind of wanted to read you that one article.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.240]  Jesse came over.
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:15.640]  We did a little outdoor grow lesson.
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:17.440]  Sounds like my voice is about to blow out anyway.
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:19.200]  So I'm gonna turn up the music
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.400]  and then we'll be back with the grow lesson.
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:22.240]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:23.200]  Hang on for just one second.
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.840]  Hey, if you got a dabber, if you got a joint,
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:27.040]  if you got a bowl, if you got an edible,
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:31.160]  if you've got a drinkable, if you've got some topical,
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:32.920]  hey, consume that at this time,
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:34.440]  because I'm gonna take a dab.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:36.320]  And that means that kind of technically
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:37.960]  we are getting high together.
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:40.800]  So when this music starts, count to about 30.
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:42.600]  And that means we're getting high together right about then.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:43.440]  Here we go.

[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:08.600]  All right, guys, you got the nail hot?
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:09.600]  You got your bowl packed?
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:10.440]  You got a joint rolled?
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:11.320]  You got something going on?
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:12.160]  Let's get stoned together.
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:13.400]  I'm gonna take a dab.
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:15.800]  I'm taking a dab of some Girl Scout Cookies Live Resin
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:17.320]  made by a close friend.
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:21.280]  I'm gonna hit a Hitman mini cake with a highly educated,
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:24.480]  it's the Infiniti nail hooked up to an E nail.
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:28.200]  It's the old Temp Temple because at one point
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:30.680]  I had arranged a sponsorship deal or something
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:32.480]  with the Temp Temple, but they've since sold the company.
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:34.200]  So I've got the Temp Temple.
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:35.640]  It's set at 460.
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:37.000]  I like it.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.080]  That's just about right, I think.
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:41.760]  So I've also got a highly educated titanium carb cap.
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:43.400]  So I'm gonna drop the dab onto the nail
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:44.640]  and then pop the carb cap on.
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:45.480]  So get high with me guys.
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:46.320]  Here we go.
[01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:55.780]  We'll be right back in just a second
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:57.380]  with Jesse's outdoor pro lesson.
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:30.540]  Yo, what's up ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:31.580]  Welcome back to the show.
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:32.620]  Hey, I've got Jesse back.
[01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:35.020]  We're gonna do another grow lesson.
[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:37.060]  Before we do that, man, I wanna say congratulations
[01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:39.340]  on the air, Jesse just got married.
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:40.220]  His wedding was awesome.
[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.540]  I'm sure you've heard his talk about it.
[01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:43.940]  So welcome to the show and congratulations, bro.
[01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:44.900]  Thank you, thank you.
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:45.780]  You look like a new man.
[01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:47.860]  You got your hair is halfway combed.
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:48.700]  Yeah.
[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:49.740]  You got a big old smile on your face.
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:52.340]  Got a haircut, groomed the beard a little.
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:55.260]  Oh, I wasn't gonna mention the grooming of the beard.
[01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:56.780]  Did you have to get refitted for your dress
[01:52:56.780 --> 01:52:57.980]  after they groomed your beard?
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:01.460]  No, because it still stayed in place.
[01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:02.300]  There you go.
[01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:04.300]  His beard is manly as fuck you guys.
[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:05.540]  If you'll let me post a picture of him,
[01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:07.700]  we'll put a picture up on the Instagram or somewhere
[01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:10.660]  so you guys can see what a man beard looks like.
[01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:11.500]  For sure.
[01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:12.340]  Colorado man beard.
[01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:14.460]  Turn myself up a little.
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:15.300]  I'm not loud enough.
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:16.220]  Sorry, it's an ego thing.
[01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:18.340]  I gotta come up more on the computer here.
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:19.180]  Awesome.
[01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:22.340]  So Jesse is a part of the Hygro store.
[01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:23.380]  His wife works there.
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:24.620]  Are you, how involved are you?
[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:26.060]  Are you an employee or are you just kind of helping
[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:26.900]  in behind the scenes?
[01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:30.260]  I am a helping behind the scenes,
[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:35.260]  helping with training employees on product lines and stuff.
[01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:36.620]  Cool.
[01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:40.580]  I'm also doing commercial sales for dispensaries,
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:42.580]  caregiver grows, stuff like that.
[01:53:42.580 --> 01:53:43.420]  So.
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:44.420]  Sweet.
[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:45.260]  Get at me.
[01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:47.460]  I'll beat anyone's price.
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:48.420]  He'll beat anyone's price.
[01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:50.460]  It's an ego thing, speaking of egos.
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:52.700]  Pushing the mic closer to his face
[01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:53.860]  so you guys can hear him a little bit better.
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:55.060]  I'll turn me down and him up.
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:56.580]  That'll make this happen.
[01:53:57.260 --> 01:53:58.100]  So speaking of Hygro,
[01:53:58.100 --> 01:53:59.940]  a couple of people that have been listening to the podcast
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:00.780]  kind of called us out.
[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:03.380]  They said 550 bucks for a tote of soil.
[01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:06.940]  If I go online, that's only $299.
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:07.780]  They're correct.
[01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:09.300]  They did some research.
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:12.180]  The caveat is if you pay $299,
[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:16.060]  shipping is $249 because it's gotta be shipped
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:18.000]  on a FedEx truck.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.860]  We were just talking about how big a tote of soil is.
[01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:23.820]  It's about the size of a Volkswagen.
[01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:27.500]  It's probably three and a half, four feet wide
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:29.260]  by three and a half to four feet tall,
[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:31.700]  depending on how much it's been compressed
[01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:34.620]  because it is gonna be kind of squished down by gravity
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:35.980]  and being moved around.
[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:37.340]  They're heavy as shit.
[01:54:37.340 --> 01:54:38.620]  Yeah, how are they getting that off the truck
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:39.940]  when they bring it to your house?
[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:41.300]  With a pallet jack.
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:43.900]  So, you know, right to your front yard.
[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:46.340]  So figure it out from there.
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:47.920]  Yeah, know where it's gonna go when they get there.
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:50.700]  Maybe you can sweet talk the guy into getting it there.
[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:53.260]  So this show is brought to you by Hygro
[01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:54.540]  and Indoor Growing Supplies.
[01:54:54.540 --> 01:54:55.360]  Make sure you check out Hygro.
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:56.380]  I'm pretty sure I already said that once in the show,
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:57.380]  but I like giving them love
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:59.900]  because they give us a lot of love.
[01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:00.740]  Jesse's back.
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:03.020]  He's gonna give us a grow lesson.
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:05.860]  We should review a little bit of what we've done.
[01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:08.120]  By now, we should have some big ass bushes
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:09.740]  that are in the veg stage, right?
[01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:11.060]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:12.660]  We've talked a little bit about feeding.
[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:14.820]  We've talked about top dressing a little tiny bit.
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:16.740]  We're gonna talk more about that.
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:19.380]  We should have them kind of, let's see,
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:21.740]  we're about to start the bloom phase and the stretch phase.
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:25.500]  So if we want to top them and do some training,
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:26.900]  now is kind of our last chance.
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:28.460]  We should stop topping by now, right?
[01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:30.660]  Unless we've got plants that are gonna clear the fence.
[01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:33.820]  Yeah, unless, you know, unless height's a concern
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:35.820]  and that's your motivation for topping.
[01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:39.580]  But you know, in that case, by all means,
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:41.860]  you know, do what you need to do to get your crop in.
[01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:42.700]  So.
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:44.180]  Yeah, yeah, you don't want the neighbors seeing that shit.
[01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:45.640]  You don't want the people walking down the street
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:46.480]  to see that shit.
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:50.940]  So if you need, and if you don't have to do it,
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:52.620]  we can pull the plants down a little bit.
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:54.300]  If you have been taking care of it,
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:57.380]  you should be able to grab some branches, the tall ones,
[01:55:57.380 --> 01:56:01.320]  and just pull them down and then maybe tie them to a stake
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:03.780]  or maybe tie them to something in the garden
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:06.260]  that's already there, like a rock or something.
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:07.580]  You can use a stake in the ground.
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:09.180]  I use big bamboo poles.
[01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:10.500]  Just spread that plant out to where
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:11.820]  instead of growing straight up,
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:13.740]  you kind of got it growing a little horizontally.
[01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:15.460]  Now's your time to get it going.
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:19.340]  Because I think within the next 10 days here,
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:22.220]  everyone's going to go into flower real heavily.
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:23.540]  Yeah, I believe so.
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:26.140]  I've got some, I've got a strain
[01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:30.100]  that's a Tom Hill's deep chunk crossed with a G13.
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:31.160]  Sorry, I fixed that noise guys.
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:32.000]  I couldn't find it.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:32.820]  I fixed all that noise.
[01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:33.660]  I just noticed it.
[01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:36.860]  It's so much better with my headphones.
[01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:38.840]  You know, I've got a strain that's got, you know,
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:41.740]  some kind of landrace stuff in it
[01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:43.860]  and it has started flowering.
[01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:44.740]  Okay.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:47.380]  Actually snuck up on me and I had to take clones
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:48.940]  that are kind of pre-flowering.
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:51.260]  So guys, that's one thing we're going to talk about.
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:52.780]  Get clones.
[01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:54.780]  If you've got some outdoor plants
[01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:57.020]  and you're waiting for them to go in flower
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:56:57.980]  and you need some clones for them
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:57:01.020]  so you can grow next year, get clones now.
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:02.180]  I always say, and this is,
[01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:03.460]  I'm going to go off on a little side rant here.
[01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:05.980]  I warned Jesse there'd be a rant about this.
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:07.640]  If you're growing from seed or a clone
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:09.460]  that is brand new to you,
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:11.500]  take some clones before you go into flower.
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:13.820]  It's really frustrating when you grow a plant
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:16.900]  and it's done and you smoke it with some of your friends
[01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:18.260]  and they're like, what the hell is this?
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:19.460]  And you're like, it's the best.
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:20.540]  And you all agree.
[01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:21.380]  And they go, I can't wait
[01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:22.960]  till you grow it even better next time.
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:25.180]  And you go, oh yeah, I don't have a clone of that.
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:27.280]  So we're never going to get to taste this ever again,
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:29.140]  except this one round.
[01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:31.260]  That's the most frustrating, heartbreaking feeling.
[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:32.980]  So take clones, you guys.
[01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:35.140]  Definitely take clones from everything that you grow
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:36.620]  if you've got the option.
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:41.420]  That's some killer advice from a seed company owner.
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:43.140]  Well, yeah, I'd want you to buy more seeds, right?
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:44.380]  But what if you find that keeper?
[01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:45.740]  What if you get that?
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:47.340]  How about when you do get that?
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:49.460]  That black cherry plant keeper.
[01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:50.500]  For sure.
[01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:52.300]  Harvest heavy, it tastes dank,
[01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:53.740]  it fucking gets you high as hell.
[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:55.340]  You're going to wish you had a clone of that.
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:56.180]  Yep.
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:57:57.620]  Yeah, I'll wish you had a clone of it too
[01:57:57.620 --> 01:57:58.860]  because I want to cut when I find you
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:00.100]  at the cannabis club or something.
[01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:01.580]  I need a clone of that one.
[01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:03.060]  So get some clones all the time.
[01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:05.080]  I'm glad you mentioned the seed company thing.
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:08.100]  Even that's sound advice right there if I'm a seed guy.
[01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:08.940]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:11.980]  So yeah, we're talking about getting those plants
[01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:13.460]  below the fence line.
[01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:16.260]  You can do the low stress technique.
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:19.060]  You can do a little bit of super cropping like Soma does,
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:21.300]  kind of crack them and bend them a little bit.
[01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:22.620]  Now's your last chance really,
[01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:24.940]  because you're going into flower in about 10 days.
[01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:27.220]  And I really don't like to mess with plants.
[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:28.540]  There are hormones in your plants,
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:31.620]  auxins and cytokinins that move around with,
[01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:34.180]  they find the tops of the plants and affect the top
[01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:36.300]  of the plant and the way that stuff grows.
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:37.820]  You don't want to disrupt that right now.
[01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:40.620]  That'll freak your plants out a little bit.
[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:42.980]  Yeah, mess up bud sizes.
[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:45.940]  Yeah, but you can still kind of pull them down
[01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:47.980]  and low stress training them,
[01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:49.420]  but you don't want to go and kick their ass
[01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:51.020]  real bad or anything.
[01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:55.180]  I've had one of my first seasons growing outdoors.
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:58.060]  I didn't top and all the plants were from seeds.
[01:58:58.060 --> 01:59:00.500]  So the Mary stem, you know, it was just,
[01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:03.540]  or the main stock was, you know,
[01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:05.440]  just as straight as could be.
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:09.940]  And I tied a rope around the top of the, sorry.
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:13.100]  I'm turning and weaving on the microphone.
[01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:14.860]  Like you're doing it too.
[01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:16.820]  Jesse brought over some live resin.
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:17.660]  Really high.
[01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:19.260]  Oh, you got to like the live resin.
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:20.140]  So great.
[01:59:20.140 --> 01:59:21.140]  Unicorn hash.
[01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:22.140]  The unicorn hash.
[01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:25.140]  So the ones you did from seed.
[01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:29.580]  Yeah, but I tied the rope around the top of the plant
[01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:31.660]  and just pulled the whole freaking thing down.
[01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:33.260]  Almost made like a bow and arrow looking thing.
[01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:34.100]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:39.100]  And the result was just like this whole head road of buds.
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:40.020]  It was super cool.
[01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:42.140]  All the side branches took over and started.
[01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:42.980]  They all went up.
[01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:43.820]  Lateral tops.
[01:59:43.820 --> 01:59:45.700]  Yeah, talking about the hormones and stuff like that.
[01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:49.220]  Yeah, cannabis wants one dominant top on the plant.
[01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:51.140]  Something, I know what it is, but I'm not going to,
[01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:53.140]  we'll go, I'm trying to go slowly with the listeners
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:54.260]  and get everybody up to speed
[01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:55.860]  and not try to Ed Rosenthal people.
[01:59:55.860 --> 01:59:58.740]  When you talk to Ed, he forgets that we're not all doctors.
[01:59:58.740 --> 01:59:59.580]  And he just starts.
[01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:00.420]  Rocket scientist.
[02:00:00.420 --> 02:00:01.380]  Yeah, a weed scientist.
[02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:02.260]  And he'll just blow your mind.
[02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:03.260]  So I'm trying to go slow for you guys.
[02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:05.300]  We'll talk about the auxins and cytokinins
[02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:06.560]  and the other hormones and plants
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:08.780]  that make them want to grow a top bud.
[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:10.580]  But when you cut out that top bud,
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:11.780]  all the other bottom buds go,
[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:13.060]  hey, I've got the opportunity.
[02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:14.900]  It's like when you kill the leader,
[02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:17.420]  all the little tribesmen think
[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:18.620]  that they could be the leader now.
[02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:20.320]  That's kind of what the top, the bottom buds do.
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:22.140]  So if you grab that plant,
[02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:23.780]  pull it over like a fishing pole would bend
[02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:25.660]  when you got a fish.
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:27.140]  All those little branches that you've got,
[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:29.500]  those little sucker buds that oftentimes we cut off,
[02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:31.020]  those will create nice little bud sites.
[02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:33.400]  Cause now they've got the chance to become a top
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:35.380]  and they're also exposed to more light.
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:36.300]  Yeah. Oh yeah.
[02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:37.140]  Yeah.
[02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:37.980]  Cool.
[02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:38.820]  It's a real neat effect.
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:40.420]  So we should be in the stretch phase
[02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:42.100]  or starting to pre flower, right?
[02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:43.140]  Yeah. Oh, totally.
[02:00:43.140 --> 02:00:43.980]  Yeah.
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:45.820]  Are you doing anything for bugs now?
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:52.460]  I spray with neem oil and I just did it the last time.
[02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:56.580]  As soon as I noticed flower,
[02:00:57.580 --> 02:01:00.580]  I really don't, especially outdoors.
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:03.260]  I really don't like spraying the plant with anything.
[02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:04.220]  Me too.
[02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:08.580]  So I stop the kelp mills, compost tea sprays
[02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:11.260]  and the neem oil sprays.
[02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:13.980]  I do that individually.
[02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:16.060]  I don't just stop the whole garden
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:18.740]  as each strain starts flowering.
[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:20.460]  It's like, oh, can't spray that plant anymore.
[02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:25.460]  So, you know, so in Southern Colorado,
[02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:27.980]  we're getting a lot of rain right now
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:30.420]  and there's some weird bugs popping up.
[02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:31.260]  Yeah.
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:32.620]  Little flying critters I've never seen.
[02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:34.860]  Yeah. Stuff's going to be out of balance.
[02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:39.140]  I personally haven't noticed any, you know,
[02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:44.140]  them being a predator, plant predators, but it could be.
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:46.020]  So.
[02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:47.260]  Those things are going to look for homes
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:48.180]  and they're going to lay eggs
[02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:49.940]  because they're normal homes for laying eggs
[02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:50.780]  are going to be disrupted.
[02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:51.620]  For sure. Yeah.
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:53.300]  And you're going to have to go look under your leaves
[02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:55.140]  and if you find some shit, put on some gloves
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:56.420]  and just clean them out of there.
[02:01:56.420 --> 02:01:57.580]  Just clean that stuff out.
[02:01:57.580 --> 02:01:58.420]  Yeah.
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:01:59.260]  If you want to give, if you're a hippie,
[02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:00.460]  you want to give those bugs a new home,
[02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:02.060]  feel free to relocate them.
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:02.980]  Fuck those bugs.
[02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:03.820]  Fucked, yeah.
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:05.300]  I'd throw them in the fucking burn if it were me.
[02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:07.460]  Compost pile, feed them to the chickens.
[02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:10.060]  Oh, I bet your chickens would love you for that.
[02:02:10.060 --> 02:02:10.900]  Yeah.
[02:02:10.900 --> 02:02:11.860]  How are you dealing with all the rain?
[02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:13.980]  Because it has been raining every day
[02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:15.780]  from about six o'clock to nine o'clock
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:17.260]  for the past week until today
[02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:20.260]  when it was fucking sweltering hot once again.
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:21.620]  I keep my plants hollowed out.
[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:25.540]  So, you know, the foliage on the inside,
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:28.540]  there isn't really any.
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:32.180]  Even in veg, I do that,
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:34.420]  especially as it gets later in veg.
[02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:36.380]  But-
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:37.780]  And you guys will learn what I cut up your plants
[02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:38.780]  a little bit.
[02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:41.380]  That helps, I think, a lot.
[02:02:41.380 --> 02:02:43.740]  The biggest thing the rain has been doing to me
[02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:46.820]  is saving me from half of the water in my plants.
[02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:48.540]  Yeah.
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:51.500]  So my main outdoor garden's in a depression.
[02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:55.300]  So a couple acres drain into it.
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:56.820]  Works out real nice.
[02:02:56.820 --> 02:02:58.140]  Plenty of water for the plants.
[02:02:58.140 --> 02:02:58.980]  There you go.
[02:02:58.980 --> 02:02:59.820]  Yeah.
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:00.660]  I have yet to be out there.
[02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:04.540]  So, hint, hint, we need to go on a short little road trip.
[02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:08.020]  I just bought my dad his first dab rig, so.
[02:03:08.020 --> 02:03:08.860]  Oh man.
[02:03:08.860 --> 02:03:09.700]  Yeah.
[02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:10.540]  I got to meet your dad at the wedding.
[02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:11.380]  Yeah.
[02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:13.140]  I thought that was who he was.
[02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:14.420]  He didn't introduce himself.
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:15.260]  It was loud.
[02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:16.900]  He just walked up, shook my hand,
[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:19.700]  nodded at me, and gave me like a man handshake
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:21.300]  and a man nod like, you're welcome.
[02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:22.140]  I like you.
[02:03:22.140 --> 02:03:23.380]  And he walked away.
[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:25.420]  And he didn't speak because it was so loud
[02:03:25.420 --> 02:03:26.260]  at where we were.
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:27.100]  Yeah.
[02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:28.260]  I wouldn't have heard him if he did speak.
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:31.060]  And I was like, that's probably pops right there,
[02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:32.140]  but I'm not certain.
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:37.140]  And dude, he beams this energy of you fucking respect me.
[02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:39.900]  That's just what comes off of him.
[02:03:39.900 --> 02:03:41.300]  You do respect me.
[02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:44.820]  And I don't want to know what'll happen if I don't
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:46.500]  because I have no intention,
[02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:47.900]  but he just looks like a man
[02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:49.420]  that commands a little bit of respect.
[02:03:49.420 --> 02:03:50.260]  Yeah.
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:51.860]  He's a, yeah.
[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:53.420]  In his younger days, he was,
[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:57.940]  I've seen him do some stuff mortal men can't do.
[02:03:58.740 --> 02:04:01.020]  Well, I watched him do immortal shit.
[02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:04.460]  He out dabbed and out drank everybody at the fucking table
[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:06.020]  where he was and then stood up
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:07.380]  and called us youngsters pussies
[02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:09.380]  because we couldn't keep up.
[02:04:09.380 --> 02:04:10.740]  You guys going to dab or what?
[02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:12.900]  Like shit, man, I'm falling out of my chair
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:13.940]  dabbed out over here.
[02:04:13.940 --> 02:04:15.940]  Well, I could use a dab then.
[02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:16.780]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:17.620]  We're on it.
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:19.660]  He's a good guy.
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:20.500]  I had fun though.
[02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:21.340]  I had fun with your whole family.
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:22.180]  It was great.
[02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:23.020]  That was awesome.
[02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:25.380]  Your wedding will be talked about not only on this podcast,
[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:28.700]  but in Colorado for years to come.
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:29.540]  I hope so.
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:30.900]  That's what I was shooting for with it.
[02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:34.940]  So first dab bar in a Colorado wedding that I'm aware of.
[02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:35.820]  Yeah, me too.
[02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:38.780]  So it was funny the day after the wedding,
[02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:40.900]  I saw, I still haven't gotten to read it,
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:42.580]  but the Washington poster,
[02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:45.900]  the New York times had an article about marijuana
[02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:50.540]  being a welcome guest at a Colorado and Washington weddings.
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:52.580]  And I was like, damn, wow.
[02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:53.620]  You're right.
[02:04:53.620 --> 02:04:54.940]  They're absolutely correct.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:58.220]  Usually at weddings, and this is just a cliche thing.
[02:04:58.220 --> 02:05:00.460]  There's usually one fight and it's usually like
[02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:02.940]  a sisterly thing or some shit.
[02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:04.100]  Oh my God, I can't believe you.
[02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:05.660]  You know, it just gets fucking stupid.
[02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:06.900]  And it's a drunk family member.
[02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:08.020]  We didn't have that.
[02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:11.300]  We actually almost did, but I derailed it.
[02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:14.940]  So, but yeah, no, that's, yeah.
[02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:17.180]  It was very chill and laid back.
[02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:18.940]  Good job to everybody for getting home safely.
[02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:20.700]  I watched everybody at the end of the night
[02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:22.780]  search for rides and all the people that were sober
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:24.300]  and were kind enough to get all you
[02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:25.620]  silly drunk fuckers home.
[02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:26.660]  That was cool.
[02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:29.140]  We party hardy, but we did, you know,
[02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:30.900]  try to be safe as possible.
[02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:31.740]  Yeah.
[02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:32.580]  Well, driving from there, you had to be safe.
[02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:34.380]  There were cops everywhere as you came back.
[02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:35.940]  I wasn't letting no one.
[02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:36.780]  Yeah.
[02:05:36.780 --> 02:05:38.020]  All right, guys, we're talking about a grow lesson.
[02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:39.220]  We're starting to bloom.
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:41.060]  Do you guys know what you're looking for
[02:05:41.060 --> 02:05:41.980]  when you're going into flower?
[02:05:41.980 --> 02:05:42.940]  Are you looking for your males?
[02:05:42.940 --> 02:05:45.020]  Are you looking for your females?
[02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:45.860]  Pretty soon.
[02:05:45.860 --> 02:05:46.700]  Lord, I hope so.
[02:05:46.700 --> 02:05:47.540]  Yeah.
[02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:49.380]  If you're growing outdoors near us, I really hope so.
[02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:50.220]  I hope you know how to find those males.
[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:52.460]  Unless it's on purpose and then right on.
[02:05:53.300 --> 02:05:54.140]  Yeah.
[02:05:54.140 --> 02:05:58.180]  So quickly, if you're looking for females,
[02:05:58.180 --> 02:05:59.620]  it looks like they're growing a cotton ball
[02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:00.460]  when they start to flower.
[02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:01.740]  It looks like you're getting a dandelion
[02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:03.220]  when they're making flowers.
[02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:07.660]  If you've got some balls and literally,
[02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:10.220]  it looks like you're growing a little pack of bananas.
[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:11.060]  Yeah.
[02:06:11.060 --> 02:06:11.900]  They start green.
[02:06:11.900 --> 02:06:12.780]  They start green.
[02:06:12.780 --> 02:06:14.500]  Yeah, and then they turn into balls.
[02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:15.380]  Kill those plants.
[02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:16.580]  Unless you're looking to make seeds
[02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:18.260]  and piss off all your neighbors that grow weed
[02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:19.740]  and seed up all their crops.
[02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:21.060]  Kill those male plants.
[02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:22.260]  Yeah.
[02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:23.740]  Yeah, just kill them.
[02:06:23.740 --> 02:06:25.620]  And if you have clones, call me.
[02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:27.220]  Yeah.
[02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:28.300]  We'll see what kind of males you got.
[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:30.060]  Maybe we'll do something fun with those.
[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:31.140]  So yeah, you're looking for the,
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:33.020]  you want the dandelion looking ones.
[02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:34.700]  That's the easiest way to describe it.
[02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:35.540]  For sure.
[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:37.580]  Honestly, we gotta do, you guys gotta read some books.
[02:06:37.580 --> 02:06:39.820]  If you aren't familiar with males and females,
[02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:40.900]  you gotta catch up a little bit,
[02:06:40.900 --> 02:06:41.900]  do a little bit of reading.
[02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:43.380]  That's kind of what a grower needs to know.
[02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:44.860]  That shit you should be doing.
[02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:47.860]  So identify the males, pull the males.
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:49.300]  And even feminize seeds.
[02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:50.180]  Keep an eye on them.
[02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:51.020]  Yeah.
[02:06:51.460 --> 02:06:53.700]  Feminizing is not a 100% process.
[02:06:53.700 --> 02:06:54.940]  It is not 100%.
[02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:58.740]  We say 99%, which still there's,
[02:06:58.740 --> 02:06:59.940]  problems happen when you're making,
[02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:01.260]  if you use certain methods,
[02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:02.860]  you're less likely to get fems.
[02:07:02.860 --> 02:07:04.180]  But if you use certain methods,
[02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:05.580]  then fems occur often.
[02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:07.900]  I've seen it at a big dispensary grow.
[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:10.980]  Grew out of like 250 feminized seeds.
[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:13.100]  And they had like four males.
[02:07:13.100 --> 02:07:14.180]  And they didn't pay attention?
[02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:15.020]  No, no.
[02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:15.860]  Oh man.
[02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:16.700]  And it all got wrecked.
[02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:18.980]  And the owner was quite pissed.
[02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:22.100]  As it was explained to him,
[02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:24.700]  99% do the math, 250 plants.
[02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:25.540]  Yep.
[02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:28.180]  And now he's got a problem with feminized seeds, right?
[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:29.020]  Yes.
[02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:30.300]  I want you to push that right in front of us a little bit.
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:31.140]  You're cool.
[02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:32.700]  I wanna make sure that people hear you.
[02:07:32.700 --> 02:07:35.820]  Dispensary owners in general don't like growing from seed.
[02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:39.420]  So the ones that do, mad props to you guys.
[02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:40.260]  Yes.
[02:07:40.260 --> 02:07:42.220]  Man, you get such great shit when you grow from seed.
[02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:43.060]  You don't know what you're gonna find.
[02:07:43.060 --> 02:07:44.660]  You get proprietary genetics.
[02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:46.220]  And you don't have the clone
[02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:48.060]  that everybody in your neighborhood's growing.
[02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:50.900]  Everybody around here right now has a damn blue dream clone.
[02:07:50.900 --> 02:07:51.740]  Flow.
[02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:52.580]  Flow.
[02:07:52.580 --> 02:07:54.780]  I kinda like that I give out flow to new growers.
[02:07:54.780 --> 02:07:56.180]  If you're like, I'm new and I need to grow,
[02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:57.220]  I'm like, try this flow cut.
[02:07:57.220 --> 02:07:58.700]  And actually I think that's Flotica.
[02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:00.700]  I don't really think that cut we have is flow.
[02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:02.340]  I've always thought the exact same thing.
[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:03.580]  So I've heard that story.
[02:08:03.580 --> 02:08:05.980]  There's somebody in Colorado that posted on Facebook
[02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:08.620]  that they know that that's Flotica
[02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:11.380]  and that they actually got that cut from Ed Rosenthal.
[02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:13.020]  So if you're listening to this show,
[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:15.340]  please tweet me or Facebook me.
[02:08:15.380 --> 02:08:17.380]  You can go to iRegenetics or iGrowCulture
[02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:19.420]  on Facebook or Twitter.
[02:08:19.420 --> 02:08:21.420]  Please, because I wanna know more about the cut of flow
[02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:23.540]  that goes around Colorado.
[02:08:23.540 --> 02:08:26.780]  There's a cut called tangerine that is not tangy.
[02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:28.100]  It's the tang.
[02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:28.940]  Which I think is-
[02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:30.180]  Man, that is so confusing.
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:32.860]  I think that is flow and Durban poison.
[02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:33.820]  Okay.
[02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:35.220]  Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:36.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:36.980]  Yeah.
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:37.940]  Gotcha.
[02:08:37.940 --> 02:08:39.820]  If anybody in Colorado knows what I'm talking about.
[02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:40.660]  It's not tangy.
[02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:41.780]  Everyone calls it tang.
[02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:43.020]  And they called it the tang tang
[02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:45.260]  or the tang tang for a little while around here.
[02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:47.020]  Oh, okay.
[02:08:47.020 --> 02:08:47.860]  Yeah.
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:48.700]  I'm pretty sure that's flow and Durban poison cross.
[02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:49.540]  Tang tang.
[02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:54.220]  I remember a big full spread of dispensary ad
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:55.260]  about that strain.
[02:08:56.220 --> 02:08:57.060]  Way back in the day.
[02:08:57.060 --> 02:08:59.620]  Somebody near the Fort Collins area made that one.
[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:00.460]  Really?
[02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:01.300]  Is from what I know.
[02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:02.140]  Yeah.
[02:09:02.140 --> 02:09:02.960]  There's a lot of,
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:03.800]  that's the problem with the weed world
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:05.720]  because by the time I give you a clone,
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:06.900]  the story has changed.
[02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:08.260]  And then you give it to somebody else
[02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:10.060]  and the story has totally changed
[02:09:10.060 --> 02:09:10.980]  and then they pass it on
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:13.300]  and now it's not even the same strain
[02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:14.260]  and it's being hoarded
[02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:16.860]  or it's being whored out for way too much money.
[02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:19.420]  It's not being grown to its potential
[02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:21.340]  because it's not being called what it is.
[02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:22.180]  Yeah.
[02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:23.260]  Patients are getting jacked.
[02:09:23.260 --> 02:09:24.100]  Yeah.
[02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:24.940]  Yeah.
[02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:26.420]  So we're in the stretch phase.
[02:09:26.420 --> 02:09:27.260]  We're blooming.
[02:09:27.260 --> 02:09:28.940]  We're getting off track here.
[02:09:28.940 --> 02:09:29.780]  It's cool.
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:30.620]  Well, yeah.
[02:09:30.620 --> 02:09:31.460]  They seem to like,
[02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:33.140]  the listeners have responded, man.
[02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:35.340]  They like it when I get all high and just talk.
[02:09:35.340 --> 02:09:36.180]  Nice.
[02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:37.020]  Yeah.
[02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:37.840]  They like it when I kind of go off course
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:38.860]  because I ate a big ass edible.
[02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:41.340]  Oh guys, I'm so glad with that edible I ate.
[02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:42.180]  I got to tell you,
[02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:44.380]  I felt like shit for the whole next day though.
[02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:47.940]  Eating that whole edible really took a toll on my body.
[02:09:47.940 --> 02:09:50.060]  I'm getting old as part of what I'm trying to say.
[02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:51.300]  I'm 35 now.
[02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:52.500]  And I think when I was 25,
[02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:53.580]  I probably could have done it
[02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:55.140]  and not felt like shit the next day.
[02:09:55.140 --> 02:09:56.740]  But I had to go get some kombucha
[02:09:56.740 --> 02:09:58.660]  and fucking eat a big fat meal.
[02:09:58.660 --> 02:09:59.500]  Oh, geez.
[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:01.460]  I had to try to put myself back on track.
[02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:03.180]  But no disrespect to that edible company.
[02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:05.500]  I was not supposed to eat all of it at once.
[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:06.340]  No.
[02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:08.100]  I listened to that episode.
[02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:08.940]  I was high.
[02:10:08.940 --> 02:10:10.500]  You weren't, yeah, not at all.
[02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:12.460]  You weren't even supposed to eat half of that at once.
[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:13.300]  No.
[02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:14.940]  Yeah, so.
[02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:16.860]  Why do they make this stuff so good though?
[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:18.540]  Oh, it was delicious too.
[02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:20.820]  If that was just like a restaurant dinner
[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:22.740]  or a restaurant dessert, I'd order that.
[02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:24.580]  I need that peanut butter thing you serve.
[02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:25.660]  Put some ice cream with it.
[02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:27.300]  It'd be delicious.
[02:10:27.300 --> 02:10:28.660]  So since we're going into flour,
[02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:30.020]  we're starting to stretch a little bit.
[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:31.340]  We're looking for the males.
[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:32.940]  We're looking for hermaphrodites also.
[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:34.700]  If it's questionable, if it's weird,
[02:10:34.700 --> 02:10:36.260]  keep a really good eye on it.
[02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:38.140]  Lower inner branches.
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:38.980]  Yeah.
[02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:41.500]  That's a good spot to look for hermies.
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:43.060]  Where you don't get as much light.
[02:10:43.060 --> 02:10:44.260]  Straight on the top too.
[02:10:44.260 --> 02:10:45.180]  Top lead buds.
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:47.540]  That's a common area too, so.
[02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:48.380]  Get those out of there.
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:50.260]  The males and the herms, get them out of there.
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:52.180]  Put them in the fire pit.
[02:10:52.180 --> 02:10:54.020]  I guess be careful when you're throwing away your trash
[02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:55.780]  if you live in a non-legal state.
[02:10:55.780 --> 02:10:57.580]  That's something that I just want to throw out there
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:10:58.420]  for you.
[02:10:58.420 --> 02:10:59.380]  Just compost it.
[02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:00.900]  Yeah, compost it if you can.
[02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:02.860]  Feed it to your chickens.
[02:11:02.860 --> 02:11:03.700]  Come on, Jesse.
[02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:05.220]  Not all of us have a farm.
[02:11:05.220 --> 02:11:06.740]  Some of us are city folk here.
[02:11:06.740 --> 02:11:08.060]  There's another.
[02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:11.500]  There's another podcast where one of the guys has chickens.
[02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:14.100]  Oh yeah, I shout those guys out so we can say that.
[02:11:14.100 --> 02:11:15.020]  Shout out to Crunchy.
[02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:15.860]  Yeah, word.
[02:11:15.860 --> 02:11:16.700]  What's up, homie?
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:17.540]  What up, bro?
[02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:18.940]  He cooked me dinner one time indirectly.
[02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:21.620]  I was at an event or at a party where he was the chef
[02:11:21.620 --> 02:11:23.060]  and he made dinner for everybody.
[02:11:23.060 --> 02:11:24.020]  And props, man.
[02:11:24.020 --> 02:11:24.860]  Good cooking.
[02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:26.780]  He actually asked me about my dietary needs
[02:11:26.780 --> 02:11:28.020]  because he saw that I got dreadlocks.
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:29.180]  He knew I was a Rasta.
[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:30.020]  Oh, that's awesome.
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:31.540]  And most Rastas have strict dietary restrictions
[02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:32.540]  and he was respectful to that
[02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:34.700]  and made a meal around what I can and cannot eat.
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:37.220]  I always do that when I barbecue with vegetarian friends.
[02:11:37.420 --> 02:11:38.260]  You don't know that yet, but I do.
[02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:40.180]  Well, you invited me and you assured me
[02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:42.340]  that there would be vegetarian friendly food.
[02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:44.180]  I appreciate that.
[02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:46.500]  So guys, respect your vegetarian friends, please.
[02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:47.740]  Don't make fun of them.
[02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:48.900]  That's just stupid.
[02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:49.740]  Yeah.
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:50.580]  It is.
[02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:51.980]  Yeah, why do you need to make fun of us?
[02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:53.900]  Yeah, dude, that is so stupid.
[02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:55.620]  We make fun of you back when you do it because-
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:56.940]  Good, they deserve it.
[02:11:56.940 --> 02:11:58.900]  Your cold is full of fucking rotten meat
[02:11:58.900 --> 02:12:00.980]  and you're telling me I'm stupid for not eating it.
[02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:01.820]  Yeah.
[02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:04.180]  We get even in our own ways.
[02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:06.180]  And then you guys die.
[02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:09.180]  Hey, hey, hey, no.
[02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:12.500]  I don't even know any good vegetarian jokes.
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:14.180]  Neither do I.
[02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:15.700]  What do you call a vegetarian with diarrhea?
[02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:17.220]  Oh yeah, that's a classic one.
[02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:18.700]  That's the only one I got for you.
[02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:23.060]  All right, vegetarian, let's feed our ganja plants.
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:26.900]  We're going into bloom so we can slowly decrease the nitrogen
[02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:29.180]  and increase the phosphorus and potassium.
[02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:32.660]  If you're top dressing, you can switch your teas
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:35.380]  to the more phosphorus and potassium based teas.
[02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:36.220]  For sure.
[02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:38.740]  If you're using the granulated products
[02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:39.940]  that they sell in the store,
[02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:42.140]  you can go ahead and switch to the bloom version
[02:12:42.140 --> 02:12:42.980]  of those products now.
[02:12:42.980 --> 02:12:44.740]  You don't have to keep using that veg stuff.
[02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:47.140]  Yeah, slowly switch that stuff though.
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:52.220]  Still, well, I don't, yeah.
[02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:54.300]  Assuming you've only applied it one or two times,
[02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:55.300]  something like that.
[02:12:56.460 --> 02:12:59.260]  Mix a little, just make sure you have nitrogen
[02:12:59.260 --> 02:13:01.940]  because a lot of times those products
[02:13:01.940 --> 02:13:05.340]  are pretty low on nitrogen on the bloom side.
[02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:07.300]  Well, actually when I feed my indoor plants,
[02:13:07.300 --> 02:13:10.100]  I don't switch the day that I put them into flower.
[02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:11.700]  I don't just say they're in flower,
[02:13:11.700 --> 02:13:13.060]  let's cut out all the veg newts
[02:13:13.060 --> 02:13:14.740]  and go to just my bloom schedule.
[02:13:14.740 --> 02:13:15.700]  I kind of phase it out.
[02:13:15.700 --> 02:13:17.220]  There's like a two week period.
[02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:19.180]  And I also keep my metal halide lights in
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:22.820]  for about 14 to 21 days to keep them short and stocky.
[02:13:22.820 --> 02:13:23.660]  And then when you switch them,
[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:26.740]  you really see them stay low and the buds fatten up.
[02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:28.300]  So that's, yeah.
[02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:30.740]  So just slowly, I like to phase out my veg
[02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:33.380]  into my bloom feed is what I think I'm trying to say.
[02:13:35.420 --> 02:13:38.620]  But yeah, start out that Mexican bat guano,
[02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:41.980]  Epsom salts if you're using that.
[02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:45.660]  It's a good time to be a full year,
[02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:47.060]  one last full year spray.
[02:13:47.060 --> 02:13:49.180]  Mexican or Jamaican bat guano?
[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:50.020]  Jamaican.
[02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:50.860]  There you go.
[02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:51.700]  Just want to correct, I think you said.
[02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:52.540]  A high PK.
[02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:56.340]  Some companies have blended guanos
[02:13:56.340 --> 02:13:58.660]  with different PK values.
[02:13:58.660 --> 02:14:00.540]  So just, you want a high PK.
[02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:03.700]  Any alfalfa meal with this feed?
[02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:04.700]  I love that stuff.
[02:14:06.100 --> 02:14:07.580]  Yeah.
[02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:09.500]  I mean, it's a great time to go ahead
[02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:10.900]  and top dress some in.
[02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:16.220]  Alfalfa meal, it's really accessible nitrogen.
[02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:18.940]  So what else are you putting in your tea right now?
[02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:20.620]  Some Jamaican guano?
[02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:21.460]  Yeah.
[02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:22.300]  Some alfalfa meal?
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:23.780]  Yep.
[02:14:23.780 --> 02:14:24.620]  Molasses.
[02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:26.420]  Molasses all the time.
[02:14:26.420 --> 02:14:29.820]  Some Rocky mountain earthworm factory.
[02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:31.820]  Some worm poop.
[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:32.740]  Yeah.
[02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:34.660]  He's got the bomb stuff.
[02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:36.340]  I'm kind of stoned.
[02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:38.060]  I can't, Rocky mountain.
[02:14:38.060 --> 02:14:38.900]  I don't remember the name of it either.
[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:40.380]  Worm company, I think is what it is.
[02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:41.220]  Yeah.
[02:14:41.220 --> 02:14:42.420]  If you Google Rocky mountain worms,
[02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:43.580]  you'll find what we're talking about.
[02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:44.700]  I've had my own,
[02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:47.820]  I've made my own worm castings before
[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:49.820]  and they didn't look as good as his do.
[02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:52.740]  It's all about what you feed those worms.
[02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:53.580]  For sure.
[02:14:53.580 --> 02:14:54.420]  For sure.
[02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:55.260]  Yeah, I know.
[02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:56.100]  He's got a real cool setup.
[02:14:56.100 --> 02:14:57.820]  Go check him out up in Springs.
[02:14:57.820 --> 02:14:59.260]  That's a free shout out too.
[02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:01.620]  Yeah, we do a lot of free shout outs.
[02:15:01.620 --> 02:15:02.460]  For sure.
[02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:03.300]  It's good stuff though.
[02:15:03.420 --> 02:15:04.260]  People grow good stuff.
[02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:05.100]  It's community, man.
[02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:05.940]  It's community.
[02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:07.500]  It's not all about business all the time.
[02:15:08.660 --> 02:15:10.500]  Some Mico's.
[02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:12.740]  You know, there's several different brands of it.
[02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:14.100]  OGT, great white shark.
[02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:15.540]  OGT, yeah.
[02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:17.220]  ZHO, if you're using botanic care.
[02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:18.060]  Yeah.
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:22.700]  The Orca stuff, liquid.
[02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:23.540]  That's half dead.
[02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:24.620]  I've never tried that.
[02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:25.620]  Yeah.
[02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:28.020]  I always fear that liquids are gonna wreak havoc
[02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:29.500]  on the rest of my stuff.
[02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:32.060]  Yeah, because you don't know what preservative there is.
[02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:33.220]  Yeah, and the powders,
[02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:35.060]  you can sprinkle it right near the root zone.
[02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:38.460]  And see that it's on there and be happy with that.
[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:39.300]  Yeah.
[02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:42.140]  OGT is available at Hygro Pueblo.
[02:15:42.140 --> 02:15:42.980]  For sure.
[02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:43.820]  That stuff's awesome.
[02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:45.700]  That's what I would recommend out of all that.
[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:47.780]  I can see a difference when I feed my plants that
[02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:50.900]  within 24 hours, the next light cycle,
[02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:52.740]  two light cycles later, I guess, when they come on,
[02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:54.420]  they are praying, they're up.
[02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:56.980]  The leaves are pointing straight up like, yes.
[02:15:56.980 --> 02:15:57.820]  Make them pray.
[02:15:57.820 --> 02:15:59.420]  Yeah, they love that shit.
[02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:00.380]  That should be their slogan.
[02:16:00.420 --> 02:16:03.140]  Yeah, no, that's OGT's the bomb.
[02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:04.620]  Great White Shark is really good
[02:16:04.620 --> 02:16:07.980]  at getting rid of soil-based insects.
[02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:08.820]  Nice.
[02:16:08.820 --> 02:16:09.660]  Oh yeah, yeah, for sure.
[02:16:09.660 --> 02:16:10.500]  Something in there it doesn't like.
[02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:11.340]  Yeah.
[02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:15.180]  I've heard the Grokashi does the same thing too.
[02:16:15.180 --> 02:16:18.780]  So we're doing some experiments with that right now.
[02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:20.420]  Yeah, Jesse mentioned before we recorded
[02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:21.500]  that he got some Grokashi.
[02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:23.660]  If you guys aren't paying attention to the Grokashi,
[02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:25.540]  it's probiotics.
[02:16:25.540 --> 02:16:27.740]  Big love to the Probiotic Farmers Alliance.
[02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:29.380]  What up, Gage Green and all the guys
[02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:31.020]  running the Probiotic Farmers Alliance.
[02:16:31.020 --> 02:16:32.700]  Oh yeah, it's Gage Green, yeah, I forgot about that.
[02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:33.540]  Yeah, it's Key Play.
[02:16:33.540 --> 02:16:35.940]  And I don't know if I should use Mike's real name,
[02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:36.780]  but what's up, Mike?
[02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:40.300]  Those guys are inspiring.
[02:16:40.300 --> 02:16:42.500]  People ask where I get a lot of my inspiration
[02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:44.460]  and a lot of my ideas and shit.
[02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:46.900]  A lot of it currently comes from Gage.
[02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:48.420]  That's who I'm on now.
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:49.260]  Nice, yeah.
[02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:52.140]  There was a time where it was all Soma, of course.
[02:16:52.140 --> 02:16:53.060]  You know, I didn't know Soma.
[02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:54.260]  I had no idea what that was.
[02:16:54.260 --> 02:16:55.180]  And then a friend of mine was like,
[02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:56.260]  you remind me of Soma.
[02:16:56.260 --> 02:16:57.100]  And I Googled it and I was like,
[02:16:57.100 --> 02:16:58.940]  that could be my father's shit.
[02:17:00.300 --> 02:17:01.140]  Then there was Subcool.
[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:02.180]  That's racist.
[02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:03.540]  Whoever told you that?
[02:17:03.540 --> 02:17:04.660]  Yeah, it kind of is.
[02:17:04.660 --> 02:17:06.580]  You're both white and have dreadlocks.
[02:17:07.540 --> 02:17:08.460]  And it was all about the vibe.
[02:17:08.460 --> 02:17:09.940]  It was more about the vibe.
[02:17:09.940 --> 02:17:11.300]  Soma talks about memetics
[02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:13.180]  and I'm really big on the memetics.
[02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:14.580]  We'll talk more about that later.
[02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:16.980]  That's the, it's like the vibes.
[02:17:16.980 --> 02:17:18.540]  Subcool always gets me going.
[02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:21.300]  Subcool, I was into Subcool for a little while.
[02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:23.420]  Not to be a hater, I lost interest when it got dramatic
[02:17:23.420 --> 02:17:25.460]  with him and Miss Jill on the Weed Nerd Show.
[02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:26.380]  That's when I fell off.
[02:17:26.380 --> 02:17:28.420]  Sorry, that's where I lost interest.
[02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:31.020]  And then I've always been a big fan of Jorge
[02:17:31.020 --> 02:17:33.300]  and Ed Rosenthal and all that stuff.
[02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:34.140]  I like reading.
[02:17:34.140 --> 02:17:36.340]  That's always gets me fired up.
[02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:38.300]  Lately, Gage Green has been one of the best readers.
[02:17:38.300 --> 02:17:40.700]  I was a Cali Connection fanboy for a little while.
[02:17:40.700 --> 02:17:43.540]  I'm pretty decent friends with Swerve and Adam Mills.
[02:17:43.540 --> 02:17:44.380]  For sure.
[02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:45.340]  He's got it going on.
[02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:48.780]  Yeah, dude, that's a good seed company right there.
[02:17:48.780 --> 02:17:49.980]  Work hard, you get paid good.
[02:17:49.980 --> 02:17:52.020]  They were kind enough to let us hang out in their booth
[02:17:52.020 --> 02:17:55.860]  for 420 at the Cannabis Cup on 420 at 420.
[02:17:56.500 --> 02:17:58.580]  Everyone else is crowded and chaotic
[02:17:58.580 --> 02:18:02.140]  and I was sitting on a couch taking a dab with Adam Mills.
[02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:03.340]  I was at the Cannabis Cup.
[02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:06.660]  Anyone who had a couch anywhere was chilling.
[02:18:08.300 --> 02:18:09.820]  That was a hot cup.
[02:18:11.020 --> 02:18:12.380]  Can't wait for 420 again this year.
[02:18:12.380 --> 02:18:13.500]  I hear big things are coming.
[02:18:13.500 --> 02:18:15.360]  I thought two years ago was crowded.
[02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:19.220]  It was more chaotic two years ago for sure though.
[02:18:19.220 --> 02:18:20.620]  Oh, that year when you couldn't walk through?
[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:21.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:22.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:23.140]  That was frustrating.
[02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:23.960]  The alley.
[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:25.420]  That alley was ridiculous.
[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:28.780]  The High Times crew, Danny Danko, Bobby Black, Nico.
[02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:30.700]  I'm gonna miss a lot because there's a lot of you guys.
[02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:32.020]  Mr. Dan's guy.
[02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:34.980]  Shout out to you guys for coming to Colorado
[02:18:34.980 --> 02:18:35.900]  and doing a huge ass event.
[02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:36.820]  That's a lot of work.
[02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:38.420]  You guys look like you're going fucking crazy
[02:18:38.420 --> 02:18:39.260]  when you come here and do it.
[02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:41.060]  Running around all chaotic.
[02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:41.900]  For sure.
[02:18:41.900 --> 02:18:43.380]  Yeah, and Danny Danko will take time to talk to you.
[02:18:43.380 --> 02:18:44.820]  I walked by him just kindly.
[02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:46.140]  I said, free weed.
[02:18:46.140 --> 02:18:46.980]  Just joking around.
[02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:47.820]  I did the same thing.
[02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:50.220]  And he turned around and shook my hand and talked to me.
[02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:51.220]  He didn't need to do that.
[02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:52.060]  He was busy.
[02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:53.900]  Yeah, I interrupted him right in the middle
[02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:54.740]  of a conversation.
[02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:58.020]  I was like, hey, thanks for recording free weed, dude.
[02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:00.100]  Hey Danny, you haven't put out a podcast in over a month.
[02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:00.940]  Yeah, what's up dude?
[02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:01.900]  We need a new episode of free weed.
[02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:03.380]  I'm trying to fill your gap, dude.
[02:19:03.380 --> 02:19:04.580]  I'm trying to fill your gap for you.
[02:19:04.580 --> 02:19:05.420]  That's gross.
[02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:06.580]  I'm never gonna say that to you again.
[02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:07.420]  Yeah.
[02:19:07.420 --> 02:19:08.260]  Yeah.
[02:19:09.780 --> 02:19:11.460]  Filling Danny Danko's gap.
[02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:12.780]  That's gross.
[02:19:12.780 --> 02:19:14.340]  There's a podcast called Free Weed.
[02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:17.380]  It's hosted by Danny Danko and Mike Hughes.
[02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:18.820]  It's a High Times production.
[02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:20.020]  I'm not sponsored by them in any way.
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:21.620]  I just have respect for people.
[02:19:21.620 --> 02:19:23.260]  Danny Danko and the Free Weed podcast
[02:19:23.260 --> 02:19:25.220]  are actually part of what inspired this show.
[02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:26.420]  For sure.
[02:19:26.420 --> 02:19:27.900]  I like to do things my way
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:30.180]  and I kind of combined a lot of my favorite people's shows
[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:31.620]  and do my own thing here.
[02:19:31.620 --> 02:19:33.500]  We have the I Grow Culture podcast.
[02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:35.020]  What's up Mike Hughes too?
[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:37.460]  Yeah, I made sure to say Mike Hughes on that show.
[02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:38.460]  Just making sure, yeah.
[02:19:38.460 --> 02:19:39.500]  Make sure he gets love.
[02:19:39.500 --> 02:19:43.220]  I always feel bad for Mike.
[02:19:43.220 --> 02:19:44.700]  Yeah, he contributes heavily.
[02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:47.220]  It should be Free Weed with Danny and Mike.
[02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:48.380]  They're Mr. Danny.
[02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:50.300]  Hear that guys?
[02:19:50.300 --> 02:19:51.140]  Just kidding, just kidding.
[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:53.180]  We'll tag at Danny Danko in this episode.
[02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:55.020]  We'll see.
[02:19:55.020 --> 02:19:56.540]  I'm not sure if I follow Mike Hughes,
[02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:58.860]  but we'll tag him also.
[02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:00.740]  We'll see if they can listen to this.
[02:20:00.740 --> 02:20:02.900]  You better hook me up with something Mike.
[02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:03.740]  No.
[02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:07.420]  A pack of raw papers.
[02:20:07.420 --> 02:20:08.260]  Hey, that'll work.
[02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:09.380]  His name is Jesse Grose.
[02:20:09.380 --> 02:20:10.460]  So if you want to give a shout out,
[02:20:10.460 --> 02:20:13.060]  it's Rasta Jeff and Jesse Grose.
[02:20:13.060 --> 02:20:13.900]  For sure.
[02:20:13.900 --> 02:20:16.020]  I think I said your full name on the other podcast.
[02:20:16.020 --> 02:20:16.860]  Sorry.
[02:20:16.860 --> 02:20:19.100]  It's gotten to the point I don't really give a shit.
[02:20:19.100 --> 02:20:20.820]  I tried to keep my identity kind of separate
[02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:23.100]  from the Irie genetics, Irie grow culture stuff,
[02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:24.500]  but everybody knows it's Rasta Jeff.
[02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:25.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:20:25.340 --> 02:20:26.260]  You can't.
[02:20:26.260 --> 02:20:27.380]  After the first Cannabis Cup,
[02:20:27.380 --> 02:20:28.940]  people took pictures with me and they're like,
[02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:30.700]  look, I'm getting high with Irie genetics.
[02:20:30.700 --> 02:20:33.220]  And I was like, well, they know I'm the fucking
[02:20:33.220 --> 02:20:35.220]  ridiculously tall white guy with dreadlocks.
[02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:36.500]  This is game over.
[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:37.780]  I remember when we first met,
[02:20:37.780 --> 02:20:39.580]  you told me something about that.
[02:20:39.580 --> 02:20:41.700]  And then within like a few weeks,
[02:20:41.700 --> 02:20:42.980]  you were like, whatever.
[02:20:44.420 --> 02:20:46.180]  Try to keep it on the down low, man.
[02:20:47.660 --> 02:20:50.260]  After the cup, when I went and Subcool is there
[02:20:50.620 --> 02:20:52.020]  with packs of seeds in his hand, like, what's up?
[02:20:52.020 --> 02:20:53.300]  I'm Subcool, here's seeds.
[02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:55.860]  I was like, I don't have shit to worry about.
[02:20:55.860 --> 02:20:57.660]  He doesn't even live in this state.
[02:20:58.540 --> 02:21:00.420]  Yeah, changed my whole outlook on things.
[02:21:00.420 --> 02:21:01.260]  For sure.
[02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:02.660]  All right, guys, we've talked a little bit
[02:21:02.660 --> 02:21:03.740]  about outdoor growing.
[02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:04.740]  We're starting to bloom.
[02:21:04.740 --> 02:21:06.780]  I told you how to find your males, your hermaphrodites,
[02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:08.220]  get those out of there.
[02:21:08.220 --> 02:21:10.300]  We told you to cut clones, make sure you cut clones.
[02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:11.820]  You don't want to grow some shit and then be like,
[02:21:11.820 --> 02:21:14.700]  this is my best strain ever and it's gone.
[02:21:14.700 --> 02:21:15.540]  I've done that.
[02:21:15.540 --> 02:21:16.380]  I actually grew a strain,
[02:21:16.380 --> 02:21:17.700]  I don't know if I even want to say the name.
[02:21:17.700 --> 02:21:18.700]  Kevin, if you're listening,
[02:21:18.700 --> 02:21:21.180]  it was that strain that you and pops loved.
[02:21:21.180 --> 02:21:22.260]  It's gone.
[02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:23.180]  I couldn't get it to root.
[02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:25.300]  Those clones would not take roots for the life of me.
[02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:27.020]  So it got away.
[02:21:27.020 --> 02:21:28.260]  I've got another pack of those seeds.
[02:21:28.260 --> 02:21:29.980]  We'll see if that works.
[02:21:29.980 --> 02:21:31.060]  You got to stop topping,
[02:21:31.060 --> 02:21:33.860]  but you can super crop and train your stuff.
[02:21:33.860 --> 02:21:35.580]  We were talking about what Jesse puts in.
[02:21:35.580 --> 02:21:37.180]  I try to, he doesn't realize,
[02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:39.300]  I'm trying to fish out what he's putting in his tea
[02:21:39.300 --> 02:21:40.300]  because he doesn't like to tell us.
[02:21:40.300 --> 02:21:41.460]  He doesn't like to share all the info,
[02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:43.500]  so I slowly pry it out of him.
[02:21:43.500 --> 02:21:46.500]  We got molasses, we got alfalfa meal, we got guano,
[02:21:46.500 --> 02:21:48.380]  we got worm castings, we got mycos.
[02:21:49.060 --> 02:21:50.220]  Are you using any sort of sea kelp right now?
[02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:51.060]  Yeah, kelp.
[02:21:51.060 --> 02:21:51.900]  Yeah, kelp.
[02:21:51.900 --> 02:21:53.860]  The Dr. Neptune stuff.
[02:21:53.860 --> 02:21:54.980]  Ah, sea details.
[02:21:54.980 --> 02:21:58.700]  For like a couple cups.
[02:22:00.060 --> 02:22:00.900]  Yeah.
[02:22:00.900 --> 02:22:02.140]  And now it's flower time.
[02:22:02.140 --> 02:22:06.180]  So blood meal, bone meal, any of that stuff yet?
[02:22:06.180 --> 02:22:07.660]  I've never put any of that stuff.
[02:22:07.660 --> 02:22:09.300]  Oh, you don't like Slaughterhouse products.
[02:22:09.300 --> 02:22:10.300]  Well, no, I use it.
[02:22:10.300 --> 02:22:11.740]  I've never put it in a tea.
[02:22:11.740 --> 02:22:12.740]  Okay.
[02:22:12.740 --> 02:22:13.580]  But top dressing?
[02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:14.420]  Yeah.
[02:22:14.420 --> 02:22:15.940]  I do have an issue with Slaughterhouse products,
[02:22:15.940 --> 02:22:20.140]  but I also have a shit ton of Slaughterhouse products.
[02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:21.740]  But you're a farmer and you understand.
[02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:22.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:24.140]  You balance it out.
[02:22:24.140 --> 02:22:26.180]  Yeah, I mean, there's nothing wrong with blood meals.
[02:22:26.180 --> 02:22:30.340]  Just like where, well, I mean, I guess the argument
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:32.020]  could be made that there is something wrong with it,
[02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:34.500]  but the biggest thing with commercial blood meals,
[02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:36.340]  we don't know where it came from.
[02:22:36.340 --> 02:22:38.780]  And you know, those, or at least that's my big issue with it.
[02:22:38.780 --> 02:22:40.500]  And those cows were fed shit
[02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:43.540]  that I would probably highly disapprove of, so.
[02:22:43.540 --> 02:22:44.540]  Yeah.
[02:22:44.580 --> 02:22:46.100]  And don't want to put into my body.
[02:22:46.100 --> 02:22:47.300]  Part of why I'm a vegetarian
[02:22:47.300 --> 02:22:48.540]  is because the way they treat cows.
[02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:49.500]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[02:22:49.500 --> 02:22:51.340]  There's no need to contribute to that, in my opinion.
[02:22:51.340 --> 02:22:54.580]  In general, I don't really like eating beef.
[02:22:54.580 --> 02:22:56.140]  I can't stand ground beef.
[02:22:56.140 --> 02:22:58.100]  It's one of the most disgusting things I can.
[02:22:58.100 --> 02:22:59.820]  That's the most questionable meat.
[02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:00.660]  You're like, what?
[02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:02.220]  Ground up, what?
[02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:05.780]  I hate when I'm working and in a hurry and yeah.
[02:23:05.780 --> 02:23:07.700]  As a farmer and a grower,
[02:23:07.700 --> 02:23:10.020]  are you bothered by like fast food joints
[02:23:10.020 --> 02:23:11.700]  by seeing what people are eating?
[02:23:11.700 --> 02:23:15.260]  Yeah, processed, any kind of processed meat.
[02:23:15.260 --> 02:23:17.100]  And I'm just as guilty of it.
[02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:21.580]  I try hard when I get busy in life, you know,
[02:23:21.580 --> 02:23:22.820]  it's just, it's hard to cook
[02:23:22.820 --> 02:23:24.700]  and it's easy to drive through, drive through.
[02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:28.460]  And, but yeah, that's why this country is so fat.
[02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:29.620]  That's why we have cancer.
[02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:30.940]  That's everything.
[02:23:30.940 --> 02:23:33.300]  It's just, yeah.
[02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:34.140]  I agree with you.
[02:23:34.140 --> 02:23:36.020]  I have a huge issue with all that stuff.
[02:23:36.020 --> 02:23:38.740]  Yeah, we paid, people will pay top dollar for their booze,
[02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:40.180]  pay top dollar for their herb,
[02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:42.660]  but then spend 99 cents on a fucking cheeseburger.
[02:23:42.660 --> 02:23:43.500]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:45.540]  Yeah, spend those bucks on yourself guys.
[02:23:45.540 --> 02:23:46.380]  Yeah.
[02:23:46.380 --> 02:23:48.340]  Cancer is expensive later in your life.
[02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:49.620]  Just cook at home.
[02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:51.020]  It's good for relationships.
[02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:52.700]  Cook with friends, eat with friends,
[02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:55.660]  eat with, you know, your wife, your girlfriend, your kids.
[02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:59.940]  It's just, you know, it's just good.
[02:23:59.940 --> 02:24:01.820]  Cook with friends for relationships.
[02:24:01.820 --> 02:24:03.460]  That's some sound advice from Jesse.
[02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:05.100]  You learned some shit on accident today.
[02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:06.740]  You didn't think that was coming.
[02:24:07.980 --> 02:24:09.580]  All right, we've done 30 minutes, man.
[02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:11.100]  You got anything else you want to add to the grow lesson
[02:24:11.100 --> 02:24:13.060]  before we kind of start wrapping it up?
[02:24:15.020 --> 02:24:16.980]  A little de-vegging.
[02:24:16.980 --> 02:24:19.540]  Go ahead and pull up the bottoms of the plants.
[02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:21.340]  So clip off any-
[02:24:21.340 --> 02:24:22.180]  Shave their legs.
[02:24:22.180 --> 02:24:23.020]  Shave their legs.
[02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:24.140]  That's make them sexy.
[02:24:24.140 --> 02:24:27.420]  All that bottom stuff is going to be crap and larf,
[02:24:27.420 --> 02:24:28.460]  and it's going to kind of take away
[02:24:28.460 --> 02:24:29.380]  from the top of your plant.
[02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:31.500]  So take that bottom, the little sucker leaves.
[02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:33.260]  You can tell what I'm talking about if it's not making,
[02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:35.340]  and you can do this all the way up to like three
[02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:37.140]  or four weeks into bloom if you want to.
[02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:37.980]  Keep doing it.
[02:24:37.980 --> 02:24:38.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:24:39.020 --> 02:24:41.540]  Take off all that crap that is in the way.
[02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:42.380]  You'll know.
[02:24:42.380 --> 02:24:44.340]  If it doesn't look like it's going to be a bud worth trimming,
[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:45.180]  take it off.
[02:24:45.180 --> 02:24:46.340]  It doesn't need to be there and throw it away.
[02:24:46.340 --> 02:24:47.380]  Don't just throw it on the ground.
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:49.140]  I see a lot of you guys cut your leaves off,
[02:24:49.140 --> 02:24:49.980]  throw them on the ground.
[02:24:49.980 --> 02:24:50.820]  Don't do that.
[02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:51.660]  Carry that shit out.
[02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:52.700]  Reuse it in some way.
[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:54.020]  Yeah.
[02:24:54.020 --> 02:24:55.500]  I've been, oh, mulching.
[02:24:55.500 --> 02:24:57.860]  That's what we'll throw up real quick.
[02:24:57.860 --> 02:24:59.740]  Been mulching up a little bit.
[02:24:59.740 --> 02:25:01.100]  A little alfalfa.
[02:25:02.940 --> 02:25:06.020]  Some old hay that we had laying around.
[02:25:06.020 --> 02:25:07.140]  Actually, I think it was straw,
[02:25:07.140 --> 02:25:09.940]  but whatever.
[02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:11.020]  All the city folk.
[02:25:11.020 --> 02:25:11.860]  Yeah.
[02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:13.780]  That is the same shit.
[02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:15.100]  Some compost.
[02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:19.100]  And it just helps hold water.
[02:25:20.060 --> 02:25:21.420]  It's getting into the hot time of year.
[02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:24.740]  And normally we're monsoon season right now apparently,
[02:25:24.740 --> 02:25:29.740]  but other people in other parts of the country,
[02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:31.900]  mulching up's good.
[02:25:31.900 --> 02:25:34.660]  And it's also a great way to get rid of all your green waste.
[02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:39.660]  So, it's just a big old cycle.
[02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:43.220]  If you're juicing, you could juice your cannabis leaves
[02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:44.860]  if you haven't been spraying shit on them.
[02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:47.460]  If you've put neem oil or some chemicals, do not juice them.
[02:25:47.460 --> 02:25:48.300]  Please don't.
[02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:50.220]  If your leaves are clean,
[02:25:50.220 --> 02:25:52.140]  go ahead and juice those and taste that up.
[02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:52.980]  Yeah.
[02:25:52.980 --> 02:25:54.460]  So we're mulching now.
[02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:55.940]  You have taught us a lot of stuff.
[02:25:55.940 --> 02:25:58.060]  Everyone's gonna move to the country and abandon the city
[02:25:58.060 --> 02:25:59.420]  and all move out to the middle of nowhere
[02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:01.860]  and just start these organic, small, not even large scale,
[02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:03.780]  just small scale organic ganja farms.
[02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:04.660]  Yeah.
[02:26:04.660 --> 02:26:05.500]  You don't have to do much.
[02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:07.140]  I mean, just do your part.
[02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:08.940]  Grow your own food, grow your own herb,
[02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:10.820]  get some chickens, make your own eggs.
[02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:12.540]  You know, I don't eat eggs.
[02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:13.780]  I really try not to eat eggs.
[02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:16.740]  If you, like, it's just not, that just seems funky to me.
[02:26:16.740 --> 02:26:18.780]  I can't eat grocery store eggs.
[02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:20.540]  If, yeah, if I, it's kind of where I'm headed.
[02:26:20.540 --> 02:26:22.980]  If I had chickens, bro, we'd eat eggs every day.
[02:26:22.980 --> 02:26:25.300]  I'd go out and get two or three eggs from the chickens
[02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:26.140]  and we'd do it.
[02:26:26.140 --> 02:26:28.460]  Like the, your shirt you're wearing there.
[02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:32.340]  You know, that yellow is like grocery store yellow
[02:26:32.340 --> 02:26:34.260]  and the orange is like what my eggs look like.
[02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:35.380]  So then, you know, that's-
[02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:37.180]  Probably 10 times the nutrients in there.
[02:26:37.180 --> 02:26:38.020]  Yeah.
[02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:38.860]  And also the flavor.
[02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:40.540]  They have a flavor, yeah.
[02:26:40.540 --> 02:26:43.980]  You just think eggs have flavor till you have good ones.
[02:26:43.980 --> 02:26:45.940]  Till you have a good farm fresh egg.
[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:48.020]  And I have my chickens in the city too.
[02:26:48.020 --> 02:26:50.620]  So we have them at the farm too,
[02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:52.860]  but I also have chickens in my backyard, so.
[02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:53.980]  You can have chickens over there?
[02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:54.820]  Yeah.
[02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:55.660]  That's cool.
[02:26:55.660 --> 02:26:56.500]  Yeah.
[02:26:56.500 --> 02:26:57.340]  That's cool.
[02:26:57.340 --> 02:26:58.180]  I didn't know you could do that.
[02:26:58.180 --> 02:26:59.020]  Can I have, in Pueblo you can have,
[02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:01.620]  don't quote me on this, but I think it's six or seven.
[02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:05.740]  No encroachment, which means, you know,
[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:07.180]  you can't build it right next to your,
[02:27:07.180 --> 02:27:09.940]  your chicken pen right next to your fence.
[02:27:09.940 --> 02:27:12.380]  It's gotta be five feet from a property line.
[02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:15.220]  No roosters, so.
[02:27:15.220 --> 02:27:16.060]  Yeah.
[02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:18.900]  And they can't be a nuisance, which, you know,
[02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:20.700]  takes a while to develop a nuisance.
[02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:24.060]  So I have one that I'm about ready to kill.
[02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:26.660]  I can't believe none of my neighbors have called in.
[02:27:27.940 --> 02:27:29.340]  It wakes me up too early.
[02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:31.460]  I'm like, you're next, bitch.
[02:27:32.380 --> 02:27:33.940]  Name is dinner, motherfucker.
[02:27:35.060 --> 02:27:36.380]  Chicken noodle soup.
[02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:37.220]  Awesome.
[02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:38.420]  Well, once again, bro, congratulations.
[02:27:38.420 --> 02:27:39.940]  We'll quit talking about the wedding on the show.
[02:27:39.940 --> 02:27:40.780]  It was so much fun, guys.
[02:27:40.780 --> 02:27:41.980]  That's why I talk about it so much.
[02:27:41.980 --> 02:27:42.820]  Epic parties.
[02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:44.580]  So congratulations to your wife also.
[02:27:44.580 --> 02:27:45.420]  Thank you.
[02:27:45.420 --> 02:27:47.420]  I don't know if she listens, but I hope you do, Burn.
[02:27:47.420 --> 02:27:49.060]  Occasionally, I force her to show.
[02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:51.420]  He's laughs at me for listening to myself.
[02:27:51.420 --> 02:27:52.940]  Well, yeah, you gotta remember what you said.
[02:27:52.940 --> 02:27:54.740]  Make sure you didn't say anything silly on the show.
[02:27:54.740 --> 02:27:55.580]  Yeah.
[02:27:55.580 --> 02:27:56.420]  Yeah.
[02:27:56.420 --> 02:27:57.620]  You're getting really good at this,
[02:27:57.620 --> 02:27:59.420]  so I'm looking forward to more episodes
[02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:00.980]  because you're starting to get comfortable.
[02:28:00.980 --> 02:28:01.940]  Awesome, awesome.
[02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:03.380]  What do you think?
[02:28:03.380 --> 02:28:04.220]  You come back about two or three weeks
[02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:05.060]  when we start kicking into flower?
[02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:06.140]  For sure, yeah.
[02:28:07.220 --> 02:28:10.220]  I'll give you a call as soon as I get some good bud set.
[02:28:11.340 --> 02:28:12.740]  Sounds good to me.
[02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:15.140]  So guys, we're gonna take some dabs.
[02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:20.140]  Go check out highgrowdenver.com, I think is the website.
[02:28:20.580 --> 02:28:23.300]  Yeah, go look at that while we take some dabs,
[02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:25.740]  and I'll be back to wrap up the show in just a minute.
[02:28:25.740 --> 02:28:26.940]  Dude, thanks again for coming on.
[02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:28.060]  We look forward to having you back.
[02:28:28.060 --> 02:28:29.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:29.900]  Peace and love, everybody.
[02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:30.740]  Have a good one, everyone.
[02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:46.860]  Well, man, that was another great grow lesson from Jesse.
[02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:48.860]  I wanna give him a big shout out for coming out,
[02:28:48.860 --> 02:28:50.900]  taking some time out from his garden.
[02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:52.980]  He's got a farm, he's got a family, he's newly married,
[02:28:52.980 --> 02:28:55.020]  so it takes a little effort to get over here,
[02:28:55.020 --> 02:28:55.860]  and I appreciate it.
[02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:56.740]  Thanks a lot, bro.
[02:28:56.740 --> 02:28:58.340]  Look forward to having you back.
[02:28:59.860 --> 02:29:00.820]  Coming up in a future episode,
[02:29:00.820 --> 02:29:02.660]  I plan to have a little debate on,
[02:29:02.660 --> 02:29:03.900]  well, not a debate, but a discussion,
[02:29:03.900 --> 02:29:07.060]  a friendly discussion on the classic question
[02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:08.340]  of clone versus seed,
[02:29:08.340 --> 02:29:10.220]  and also we'll have a little subtopic
[02:29:10.220 --> 02:29:12.420]  of feminized versus regular seeds.
[02:29:12.460 --> 02:29:14.940]  I know a lot of people are opposed to feminized seeds,
[02:29:14.940 --> 02:29:16.380]  so we can talk a little bit about that,
[02:29:16.380 --> 02:29:19.580]  clear up some myths, give some people some information.
[02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:21.340]  Oh, check it out, that's Red Rat in the song there.
[02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:23.780]  Yeah, turn that up for a minute, let's get down.
[02:29:27.970 --> 02:29:29.090]  It's a pretty good mix, Nika.
[02:29:29.090 --> 02:29:31.530]  Shout out for this brand new mix that Nika T just made.
[02:29:31.530 --> 02:29:32.770]  Pretty smooth, I like it.
[02:29:33.610 --> 02:29:35.730]  All right, so now the show is over.

[02:29:49.970 --> 02:29:51.450]  It's a little harder to get to those comments,

[02:34:23.730 --> 02:34:26.850]  We had a little conversation about seeds versus clones.
[02:34:26.850 --> 02:34:28.210]  And we also talked a little bit about
[02:34:28.210 --> 02:34:30.450]  feminized seeds and auto flower seeds.
[02:34:31.450 --> 02:34:33.370]  None of us really seem to like auto flower seeds,
[02:34:33.370 --> 02:34:36.350]  but we did talk about one very useful application.
[02:34:36.350 --> 02:34:39.610]  So we'll go ahead and get right to that.
[02:34:39.610 --> 02:34:42.050]  We did get a little dabbed out.
[02:34:42.050 --> 02:34:43.930]  So if we got off track and you have questions,
[02:34:43.930 --> 02:34:47.130]  please, please contact me online somehow.

[02:35:10.690 --> 02:35:12.650]  let's go get to the conversation
[02:35:12.650 --> 02:35:15.250]  with Jesse, Spence and myself.
[02:35:15.250 --> 02:35:16.090]  Check it out.
[02:35:17.130 --> 02:35:17.970]  All right.
[02:35:17.970 --> 02:35:18.970]  What's up ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[02:35:18.970 --> 02:35:19.810]  I've got my homie Jesse.
[02:35:19.810 --> 02:35:32.930]  What's up?
[02:35:32.930 --> 02:35:34.770]  At Jesse grows on Instagram and Twitter.
[02:35:34.770 --> 02:35:37.010]  And also we got, is it at Jesse grows on Twitter?
[02:35:37.010 --> 02:35:37.850]  I looked for you, bro.
[02:35:37.850 --> 02:35:40.010]  There's another person called Jesse grows on Twitter.
[02:35:40.010 --> 02:35:40.850]  Oh, fuck that guy.
[02:35:40.850 --> 02:35:42.690]  How the hell is that even?
[02:35:42.690 --> 02:35:43.530]  Politely fuck that guy.
[02:35:43.530 --> 02:35:44.370]  Yeah.
[02:35:44.370 --> 02:35:45.190]  I don't even know him.
[02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:46.030]  Yeah, actually I don't know him, but.
[02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:46.870]  He could be cool as shit.
[02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:49.870]  It could be like your, your German clone or something.
[02:35:49.870 --> 02:35:50.710]  I don't know.
[02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:51.530]  I don't know.
[02:35:51.530 --> 02:35:52.370]  I don't know.
[02:35:52.370 --> 02:35:53.210]  I don't know.
[02:35:53.210 --> 02:35:54.030]  I don't know.
[02:35:54.030 --> 02:35:54.870]  I don't know.
[02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:55.710]  I don't know.
[02:35:55.710 --> 02:35:56.530]  I don't know.
[02:35:56.530 --> 02:35:57.370]  I don't know.
[02:35:57.570 --> 02:35:59.650]  Your German clone or something.
[02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:02.770]  Be just like Germany is Jesse gross.
[02:36:04.330 --> 02:36:06.410]  Also with us over here on the microphone is our buddy
[02:36:06.410 --> 02:36:07.250]  Spence.
[02:36:07.250 --> 02:36:08.070]  What up Spence?
[02:36:08.070 --> 02:36:08.910]  What up guys?
[02:36:08.910 --> 02:36:11.050]  Spence has got his microphone strategically placed
[02:36:11.050 --> 02:36:14.130]  so that he can iPhone it up on the table and talk
[02:36:14.130 --> 02:36:15.170]  and talk at the same time.
[02:36:15.170 --> 02:36:16.210]  He's got the elbows out.
[02:36:16.210 --> 02:36:17.050]  He's chilling it up.
[02:36:17.050 --> 02:36:18.370]  We have had some fat dabs today.
[02:36:18.370 --> 02:36:19.690]  What did you give me a dab of a minute ago?
[02:36:19.690 --> 02:36:20.510]  That live resin.
[02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:21.350]  What was that?
[02:36:21.350 --> 02:36:22.410]  It's a Yeti OG.
[02:36:22.410 --> 02:36:23.250]  Oh yeah.
[02:36:23.250 --> 02:36:24.070]  Okay.
[02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.910]  That's why I loved it.
[02:36:24.910 --> 02:36:26.030]  We've been smoking on that Yeti OG around here
[02:36:26.030 --> 02:36:27.630]  for a couple of weeks.
[02:36:27.630 --> 02:36:30.390]  Big ups to the people making the live resin happen.
[02:36:30.390 --> 02:36:31.230]  We appreciate it.
[02:36:31.230 --> 02:36:32.510]  There's a whole chain of people that make that happen.
[02:36:32.510 --> 02:36:33.470]  It's not one or two people.
[02:36:33.470 --> 02:36:35.070]  It's a big chain of command.
[02:36:35.070 --> 02:36:35.910]  I appreciate that.
[02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:37.310]  Very much so.
[02:36:37.310 --> 02:36:38.150]  Thank you.
[02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:39.990]  How are you guys doing today, man?
[02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:41.510]  Chilling.
[02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:43.790]  Excited to be here for another podcast.
[02:36:43.790 --> 02:36:44.750]  He told me what you did today.
[02:36:44.750 --> 02:36:45.670]  I think it's funny.
[02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:46.870]  We won't talk about that on the show.
[02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:48.790]  That's hilarious.
[02:36:48.790 --> 02:36:52.350]  Man is getting his hustle on in ways you never thought of.
[02:36:52.350 --> 02:36:54.530]  Jesse dug fence post holes all day.
[02:36:54.530 --> 02:36:55.370]  So he's lively.
[02:36:55.730 --> 02:36:56.570]  Jesse's over here hyper.
[02:36:56.570 --> 02:36:57.410]  Not at all.
[02:36:57.410 --> 02:36:59.370]  He just took a fat dab.
[02:36:59.370 --> 02:37:01.330]  I think we all took fat dabs over here.
[02:37:01.330 --> 02:37:02.170]  Okay.
[02:37:02.170 --> 02:37:02.990]  Maybe all of us.
[02:37:02.990 --> 02:37:03.830]  Well, yeah, Jesse did just take,
[02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:05.050]  that was the largest dab I've ever seen
[02:37:05.050 --> 02:37:07.490]  Jesse voluntarily take on his own.
[02:37:07.490 --> 02:37:08.930]  I've seen people give him a dab that big,
[02:37:08.930 --> 02:37:11.290]  but I've never seen him dip in for that.
[02:37:11.290 --> 02:37:13.730]  I've been practicing the last few weeks.
[02:37:13.730 --> 02:37:14.890]  Put some music up for you guys.
[02:37:14.890 --> 02:37:15.730]  Sorry.
[02:37:15.730 --> 02:37:17.090]  Turned it down way so low we couldn't hear it.
[02:37:17.090 --> 02:37:17.930]  Nice.
[02:37:17.930 --> 02:37:19.530]  Well, we're here together and talk about
[02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:21.490]  the subject at hand, which today I decided
[02:37:21.490 --> 02:37:24.530]  we want to talk about clones versus seeds.
[02:37:24.570 --> 02:37:26.130]  And maybe we'll do a little bit of talking
[02:37:26.130 --> 02:37:27.650]  about feminized seeds.
[02:37:27.650 --> 02:37:29.970]  And we might talk a little bit briefly,
[02:37:29.970 --> 02:37:31.490]  briefly about auto flowers.
[02:37:31.490 --> 02:37:32.810]  I got one thing I wanted to mention in there.
[02:37:32.810 --> 02:37:34.810]  This mix that I'm playing really has a lot of volume jumps
[02:37:34.810 --> 02:37:35.650]  in the background.
[02:37:35.650 --> 02:37:37.690]  So I apologize that it's so jumpy.
[02:37:37.690 --> 02:37:39.530]  You're listening to DJ Nick and T in the background again.
[02:37:39.530 --> 02:37:40.490]  I got to give him a shout out.
[02:37:40.490 --> 02:37:41.490]  Shout out DJ Nick and T.
[02:37:41.490 --> 02:37:42.570]  Thanks for letting me play your music.
[02:37:42.570 --> 02:37:44.090]  That's awesome.
[02:37:44.090 --> 02:37:45.890]  So everybody at this table is a pretty damn
[02:37:45.890 --> 02:37:47.130]  experienced grower.
[02:37:47.130 --> 02:37:49.250]  We got, I'd call myself a breeder.
[02:37:49.250 --> 02:37:51.050]  Jesse's a pollen chucker, maybe a breeder.
[02:37:51.050 --> 02:37:53.450]  I don't know if he'd call himself a breeder yet.
[02:37:53.450 --> 02:37:54.370]  More practice.
[02:37:55.210 --> 02:37:56.210]  Spence is a hell of a grower.
[02:37:56.210 --> 02:37:58.810]  We had some stuff tested and Spence has tested
[02:37:58.810 --> 02:38:00.050]  higher than all of my stuff.
[02:38:00.050 --> 02:38:01.410]  And he grew somebody else's strain.
[02:38:01.410 --> 02:38:03.290]  Do you remember what the numbers were, bro?
[02:38:04.610 --> 02:38:07.530]  Capleton was 20%.
[02:38:09.610 --> 02:38:11.730]  There's a Girl Scout cookie cross,
[02:38:11.730 --> 02:38:14.450]  which was creepy OG and Girl Scout.
[02:38:14.450 --> 02:38:19.450]  It was 25, maybe 24, probably 24.
[02:38:19.530 --> 02:38:24.130]  Ryan's Rhino, a hundred percent sativa, 25%.
[02:38:24.890 --> 02:38:27.130]  And then Forum Girl Scout cookies
[02:38:27.130 --> 02:38:28.970]  tested at right around 27.
[02:38:28.970 --> 02:38:29.850]  So this guy crushed it.
[02:38:29.850 --> 02:38:31.690]  He had some great, great tests.
[02:38:31.690 --> 02:38:34.530]  My veganic lemon Jeffrey tested right around 24%.
[02:38:34.530 --> 02:38:35.370]  If that gives you some.
[02:38:35.370 --> 02:38:37.090]  Which by the way, that was awesome.
[02:38:37.090 --> 02:38:38.610]  It was some of the best veganic weed
[02:38:38.610 --> 02:38:40.490]  I've probably ever smoked.
[02:38:40.490 --> 02:38:41.330]  Well, thank you.
[02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:42.570]  How much of veganic weed have you smoked?
[02:38:42.570 --> 02:38:43.410]  Do you know?
[02:38:43.410 --> 02:38:44.250]  I've smoked some.
[02:38:44.250 --> 02:38:46.930]  I've smoked some from, there's a place in the Springs.
[02:38:46.930 --> 02:38:49.650]  I think it's Natural Mystics, they sell it.
[02:38:49.650 --> 02:38:51.170]  That's really the only really place.
[02:38:51.170 --> 02:38:55.450]  And then I tried some of Buds and Roses at the Cubs.
[02:38:55.450 --> 02:38:56.290]  And that was pretty good.
[02:38:56.290 --> 02:38:57.130]  Kyle Cushman's Veganics.
[02:38:57.130 --> 02:38:58.850]  So mine stood up to Kyle Cushman's.
[02:38:58.850 --> 02:38:59.690]  Definitely.
[02:38:59.690 --> 02:39:00.730]  That's a hell of a compliment right there.
[02:39:00.730 --> 02:39:04.970]  It's definitely, you have a thing for sativas.
[02:39:04.970 --> 02:39:06.450]  And not a lot of people like sativas,
[02:39:06.450 --> 02:39:09.250]  but I like the, you know, the citrusy,
[02:39:09.250 --> 02:39:10.370]  really high highs.
[02:39:10.370 --> 02:39:12.010]  So I think it was good.
[02:39:12.010 --> 02:39:13.370]  Letting the plank take more time to grow
[02:39:13.370 --> 02:39:15.450]  like a sativa does, it lets you get more out of it.
[02:39:15.450 --> 02:39:18.410]  It's nothing but the longer, the better in my opinion.
[02:39:18.410 --> 02:39:19.250]  For sure.
[02:39:19.250 --> 02:39:20.690]  Depending on your technique, you know what I'm saying?
[02:39:21.210 --> 02:39:22.050]  Yeah.
[02:39:22.050 --> 02:39:23.930]  Guys quit cutting your plants down too early.
[02:39:23.930 --> 02:39:24.770]  All right.
[02:39:24.770 --> 02:39:25.690]  So yeah, that was just,
[02:39:25.690 --> 02:39:27.490]  and Jesse to give him some credit in the game,
[02:39:27.490 --> 02:39:29.610]  he won the Pueblo Super Bud Bowl
[02:39:29.610 --> 02:39:31.090]  and they gave him hella huge compliments.
[02:39:31.090 --> 02:39:32.450]  If you guys listened to past episodes,
[02:39:32.450 --> 02:39:34.170]  we talked about that.
[02:39:34.170 --> 02:39:36.090]  The judges of the Super Bud Bowl said
[02:39:36.090 --> 02:39:39.410]  that Jesse's strains stood out in flavor, aroma,
[02:39:39.410 --> 02:39:41.650]  taste and effect overall, without a doubt.
[02:39:41.650 --> 02:39:44.690]  He was the hands down winner, the freaking champ, right?
[02:39:44.690 --> 02:39:45.530]  Yes.
[02:39:45.530 --> 02:39:46.370]  Grape OG.
[02:39:46.370 --> 02:39:47.190]  Something like that, yes.
[02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:48.030]  Grape OG.
[02:39:48.030 --> 02:39:48.870]  It's a hell of a strain too.
[02:39:48.870 --> 02:39:50.410]  I took some cuts of it today.
[02:39:51.130 --> 02:39:51.970]  We'll see what happens.
[02:39:51.970 --> 02:39:53.450]  So these guys are, we're all experienced growers here.
[02:39:53.450 --> 02:39:55.130]  I'm of course the breeder for my Regenetics,
[02:39:55.130 --> 02:39:56.370]  so I know what I'm doing.
[02:39:56.370 --> 02:39:58.970]  We're gonna talk a little bit about clones and seeds.
[02:39:58.970 --> 02:40:00.090]  Do you have a preference Jesse
[02:40:00.090 --> 02:40:02.330]  from growing from clone or seed?
[02:40:04.570 --> 02:40:06.930]  Has more to do with the admission, I guess,
[02:40:06.930 --> 02:40:09.370]  of whatever particular round.
[02:40:09.370 --> 02:40:14.370]  But I'd grow from seed if that was all I could do
[02:40:16.570 --> 02:40:17.810]  from now on.
[02:40:17.810 --> 02:40:18.650]  Okay.
[02:40:18.650 --> 02:40:19.470]  So if you were gonna set up,
[02:40:19.470 --> 02:40:20.310]  I guess a better question would be,
[02:40:21.150 --> 02:40:22.030]  if you were gonna set up a giant warehouse,
[02:40:22.030 --> 02:40:24.230]  not a giant, what if I give you 20 lights
[02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:27.030]  and I was 20 flowering lights and it's all yours,
[02:40:27.030 --> 02:40:28.110]  you're gonna start brand new,
[02:40:28.110 --> 02:40:30.410]  would you grow from clones or seeds at that point?
[02:40:31.710 --> 02:40:32.990]  I'd probably go with clones.
[02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:34.350]  Okay, cool.
[02:40:34.350 --> 02:40:35.190]  All right.
[02:40:35.190 --> 02:40:38.390]  How about you Spence, if you had 20 lights to play with?
[02:40:38.390 --> 02:40:39.870]  If I had it to play with,
[02:40:39.870 --> 02:40:43.310]  I'd probably take like two lights and maybe do some seeds,
[02:40:43.310 --> 02:40:47.350]  but there's just, you know, when you're that scale,
[02:40:47.350 --> 02:40:49.150]  you want something that's proven
[02:40:49.190 --> 02:40:50.350]  to give you what you want.
[02:40:50.350 --> 02:40:52.030]  That's a perfect segue into what I was gonna say.
[02:40:52.030 --> 02:40:54.830]  Clones, the pros of clones are that,
[02:40:54.830 --> 02:40:56.550]  you know, you've got females,
[02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:57.630]  those have been ran and tested.
[02:40:57.630 --> 02:40:58.590]  So if you've got a clone,
[02:40:58.590 --> 02:40:59.790]  I'll talk a little bit about a clone
[02:40:59.790 --> 02:41:00.950]  and give some setup for what they are,
[02:41:00.950 --> 02:41:02.430]  because people are new listeners.
[02:41:02.430 --> 02:41:04.790]  A clone is a cutting taken from a plant,
[02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:07.750]  a mother plant that you hopefully have ran before
[02:41:07.750 --> 02:41:10.150]  and flowered out and you know that that's some good shit.
[02:41:10.150 --> 02:41:10.990]  Or someone else has.
[02:41:10.990 --> 02:41:11.830]  Or someone else has.
[02:41:11.830 --> 02:41:14.070]  When you're trusted bros like Spence or Jesse at the table,
[02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:15.150]  if they give me a clone,
[02:41:15.150 --> 02:41:17.750]  I definitely appreciate it and trust it.
[02:41:17.790 --> 02:41:20.070]  I don't usually get dispensary clones and stuff.
[02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:22.230]  They're mediocre most of the time.
[02:41:22.230 --> 02:41:23.790]  So you gotta know who you're getting it from.
[02:41:23.790 --> 02:41:25.230]  But usually it's a reliable crop.
[02:41:25.230 --> 02:41:26.830]  It's a female.
[02:41:26.830 --> 02:41:27.870]  You're familiar with it.
[02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:29.130]  Somebody in the crew has grown it.
[02:41:29.130 --> 02:41:30.750]  We can say that takes eight weeks,
[02:41:30.750 --> 02:41:32.350]  that takes nine weeks, that takes 10 weeks,
[02:41:32.350 --> 02:41:34.550]  or be careful because that fucker might harm
[02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:35.630]  if you over nitrogen it.
[02:41:35.630 --> 02:41:37.790]  You know, there's things we know.
[02:41:37.790 --> 02:41:40.990]  So that's one of the super, super pros of a clone.
[02:41:40.990 --> 02:41:41.910]  We know the growth patterns.
[02:41:41.910 --> 02:41:43.750]  We know if we need to top it.
[02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:45.270]  We know if we need to train it a little bit.
[02:41:45.270 --> 02:41:46.350]  We know how tall it's gonna get.
[02:41:46.350 --> 02:41:48.310]  I know that the Sour Diesel Cut I've got,
[02:41:48.310 --> 02:41:50.230]  if you let it grow more than two feet tall in veg,
[02:41:50.230 --> 02:41:52.230]  it's gonna be eight feet tall in flour.
[02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:54.470]  And I know that from, we've grown it several times.
[02:41:54.470 --> 02:41:57.390]  I think I grew that one time and I learned.
[02:41:57.390 --> 02:41:59.550]  Yeah, you learned quick on that shit.
[02:41:59.550 --> 02:42:00.830]  Tickling your lights.
[02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:02.870]  And then you know what to feed it also
[02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:04.150]  because you know how long it's gonna take.
[02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:05.270]  You know when to begin flushing.
[02:42:05.270 --> 02:42:07.310]  You know when it's gonna be done.
[02:42:07.310 --> 02:42:08.590]  The cons of clones.
[02:42:08.590 --> 02:42:11.430]  This is why I was asking about the giant warehouse.
[02:42:11.430 --> 02:42:15.110]  Clones are where you get most of your damn bugs, I think.
[02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:17.790]  One of your buddies tries to give you a sweet cut,
[02:42:17.790 --> 02:42:20.430]  a Sour Diesel, and you get it to your garden
[02:42:20.430 --> 02:42:21.470]  and you're irresponsible.
[02:42:21.470 --> 02:42:22.870]  And it's partly your responsibility
[02:42:22.870 --> 02:42:25.390]  to quarantine and treat that thing.
[02:42:25.390 --> 02:42:29.590]  But sometimes you fail yourself just like that guy did.
[02:42:29.590 --> 02:42:32.670]  And you end up with spider mites,
[02:42:32.670 --> 02:42:35.670]  the feared hemp russet mite in your weed garden right now.
[02:42:35.670 --> 02:42:38.950]  Those things will take down your entire crop in two days.
[02:42:38.950 --> 02:42:40.470]  I had a friend tell me he had those.
[02:42:40.470 --> 02:42:42.110]  He's like, you wanna see them?
[02:42:42.110 --> 02:42:42.950]  Nope.
[02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:44.470]  I don't even wanna see you anymore.
[02:42:44.910 --> 02:42:47.390]  If you ever get those, just start over.
[02:42:47.390 --> 02:42:48.390]  Yeah, fire is the cure.
[02:42:48.390 --> 02:42:50.750]  I actually, I have something I'm experimenting with,
[02:42:50.750 --> 02:42:51.590]  a product.
[02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:52.950]  I don't know if I've mentioned it on the show
[02:42:52.950 --> 02:42:53.870]  because I don't wanna say anything
[02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:55.710]  until I'm familiar with it.
[02:42:55.710 --> 02:42:57.830]  It seems to kill everything.
[02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:59.190]  Unfortunately, if you do it wrong,
[02:42:59.190 --> 02:43:01.350]  it will kill everything.
[02:43:01.350 --> 02:43:02.950]  I've volunteered a few plants
[02:43:02.950 --> 02:43:04.430]  and I did a few different applications
[02:43:04.430 --> 02:43:07.670]  and a couple of them, they just fucking cooked them.
[02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:09.790]  But if I learn to do it right, I feel like it'll work well.
[02:43:09.790 --> 02:43:11.710]  So I'm gonna learn it.
[02:43:11.710 --> 02:43:13.550]  That's gonna make you hard to hear.
[02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:15.230]  Jesse's afraid of the microphone.
[02:43:16.390 --> 02:43:17.670]  There we go, that's awesome.
[02:43:17.670 --> 02:43:19.790]  Dude, right there, we can hear you all day just like that.
[02:43:19.790 --> 02:43:21.310]  See, I keep worrying about that.
[02:43:21.310 --> 02:43:22.150]  That's cool.
[02:43:22.150 --> 02:43:23.630]  If you guys are wondering what that furry sound is,
[02:43:23.630 --> 02:43:24.790]  it's music in the background.
[02:43:24.790 --> 02:43:27.510]  It's not Jesse's beard rubbing on the microphone.
[02:43:27.510 --> 02:43:29.630]  So we get our bugs, our problems, our diseases,
[02:43:29.630 --> 02:43:32.830]  our pathogens, powdery mildew comes from clones.
[02:43:32.830 --> 02:43:34.630]  Seeds do not carry bugs.
[02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:35.870]  They do not carry diseases.
[02:43:35.870 --> 02:43:38.150]  They do not carry pathogens.
[02:43:38.150 --> 02:43:39.790]  Something about a clone,
[02:43:39.790 --> 02:43:43.110]  if I grow a pack of seeds and I pick the keeper out of that,
[02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:44.510]  so you grow 10 seeds,
[02:43:44.510 --> 02:43:45.350]  there'll be different phenotypes in there.
[02:43:45.350 --> 02:43:47.830]  Hopefully you find that one that's stellar.
[02:43:47.830 --> 02:43:49.750]  Maybe my opinion of that stellar plant
[02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:51.550]  is way different than Spence's opinion
[02:43:51.550 --> 02:43:53.190]  or way different than Jesse's opinion
[02:43:53.190 --> 02:43:54.470]  or the other guy growing.
[02:43:55.310 --> 02:43:57.630]  I like the ability to pick my own,
[02:43:57.630 --> 02:44:00.910]  which is a benefit of the seed and a con of the clone.
[02:44:02.310 --> 02:44:04.510]  And maybe my grow style or what I'm looking for
[02:44:04.510 --> 02:44:07.110]  is way different than what you guys are looking for.
[02:44:08.470 --> 02:44:09.830]  When you get a 10 pack of seeds,
[02:44:09.830 --> 02:44:11.750]  how many keepers do you hope to find out of those?
[02:44:11.750 --> 02:44:12.830]  Do you hope for that just one
[02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:14.390]  or are you looking for all 10 of them?
[02:44:14.390 --> 02:44:18.430]  I usually, I just look for differences throughout
[02:44:18.430 --> 02:44:20.910]  because some of them, depending on what you're,
[02:44:20.910 --> 02:44:22.070]  what kind of seeds you're popping,
[02:44:22.070 --> 02:44:24.550]  you'll find differences and whatnot.
[02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:27.590]  So I usually try to keep three just so I have,
[02:44:28.510 --> 02:44:31.350]  if I have three plants that don't all look the same,
[02:44:31.350 --> 02:44:33.990]  maybe I just want a better chance of finding something
[02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:37.430]  that's not as, or that's better than one or the other.
[02:44:37.430 --> 02:44:39.030]  It's good that you say three in my opinion,
[02:44:39.030 --> 02:44:41.190]  because usually I find the one that looks like,
[02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:43.030]  if you're crossing a male and a female plant,
[02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:44.230]  I like to find the male,
[02:44:44.230 --> 02:44:45.350]  like the one that looks like the male,
[02:44:45.350 --> 02:44:46.670]  the one that looks like the female,
[02:44:46.670 --> 02:44:48.750]  and then that one that's a hybrid of the two.
[02:44:48.750 --> 02:44:50.470]  And it's usually a good way to do it.
[02:44:50.470 --> 02:44:52.990]  And then smoke all those, get them tested,
[02:44:52.990 --> 02:44:54.830]  do what you can, have the crew smoke them,
[02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:57.510]  make shatter out of them, make live resin out of them,
[02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:59.230]  see what happens to all that stuff.
[02:44:59.230 --> 02:45:00.390]  Cure them a long time.
[02:45:00.390 --> 02:45:01.470]  Cure them a long time.
[02:45:01.470 --> 02:45:03.270]  That's something I failed at when I was a new grower.
[02:45:03.270 --> 02:45:04.230]  I would take that stuff
[02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:06.150]  and as soon as it was dry enough to start smoking,
[02:45:06.150 --> 02:45:09.070]  I'd start smoking it up, see which was my favorite.
[02:45:09.070 --> 02:45:11.150]  I'm sure I got rid of a few keepers.
[02:45:12.110 --> 02:45:12.950]  I just didn't even know yet.
[02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:14.350]  Man, yeah, yeah.
[02:45:14.350 --> 02:45:17.190]  So I guess that leads us into seeds a little bit.
[02:45:17.190 --> 02:45:18.350]  When you buy a 10 pack of seeds,
[02:45:18.350 --> 02:45:19.990]  I really like that variation.
[02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:22.330]  So you buy a 10 pack, you pop them.
[02:45:22.330 --> 02:45:25.670]  Sometimes there's fucking seven males in there.
[02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:26.510]  God.
[02:45:26.510 --> 02:45:28.550]  Yeah, but that's nature.
[02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:29.390]  It does happen.
[02:45:29.390 --> 02:45:30.670]  It's a numbers game.
[02:45:30.670 --> 02:45:31.590]  It's like bingo.
[02:45:31.590 --> 02:45:32.990]  It is like bingo.
[02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:34.910]  So hopefully you get that one good one.
[02:45:34.910 --> 02:45:37.790]  So hopefully you get some five, five males, five females,
[02:45:37.790 --> 02:45:40.510]  is usually what I hope for, somewhere in that area.
[02:45:40.870 --> 02:45:42.830]  And you hope to get one that you can spot right away
[02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:44.550]  that you're like, and we got to call that bitch.
[02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:45.990]  And then you got those four to work with.
[02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:47.710]  And like Spence said, you get three.
[02:45:47.710 --> 02:45:49.570]  So that's where you find new stuff.
[02:45:49.570 --> 02:45:51.850]  That's one of the pros of growing from seed.
[02:45:51.850 --> 02:45:53.610]  You find all that new stuff.
[02:45:53.610 --> 02:45:55.210]  And there's something I thought about earlier.
[02:45:55.210 --> 02:45:58.510]  Everything we're growing came from seed in the first place.
[02:45:58.510 --> 02:46:01.190]  Eventually, down the road, it came from a seed.
[02:46:01.190 --> 02:46:02.630]  The way it's supposed to be.
[02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:05.270]  Yeah, we couldn't have a plant without the seed.
[02:46:05.270 --> 02:46:07.630]  Nobody took a clone of OG Kush.
[02:46:07.630 --> 02:46:08.470]  Yeah.
[02:46:08.470 --> 02:46:11.130]  Everyone keeps growing from clone.
[02:46:12.950 --> 02:46:16.270]  There are very bad consequences to that.
[02:46:16.270 --> 02:46:17.170]  What could happen?
[02:46:18.750 --> 02:46:21.550]  Big major companies could maintain control of it.
[02:46:22.950 --> 02:46:27.950]  The seed stock, similar to some ornamental flowers
[02:46:28.550 --> 02:46:31.330]  that I can't quote species of or anything like that.
[02:46:31.330 --> 02:46:33.470]  But I know it's really hard to find
[02:46:33.470 --> 02:46:35.350]  like genuine seed of some flowers.
[02:46:35.350 --> 02:46:37.030]  Yeah, and a lot of the vegetables,
[02:46:37.030 --> 02:46:38.990]  you can only find specific seeds.
[02:46:38.990 --> 02:46:39.830]  For sure.
[02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:40.670]  Okay, damn.
[02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:41.990]  See, so there you go.
[02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:43.390]  More beneficial to grow from seed
[02:46:43.390 --> 02:46:45.070]  or a benefit of growing from seed.
[02:46:45.070 --> 02:46:47.570]  Or they'll just start selling only feminized seed.
[02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:49.990]  There won't be a gene pool.
[02:46:49.990 --> 02:46:51.430]  And that's something as a breeder,
[02:46:51.430 --> 02:46:52.950]  I try to pay attention to.
[02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:54.870]  I try to make, and you guys have probably noticed,
[02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:57.590]  I've been pulling out a lot more reg seeds lately.
[02:46:57.590 --> 02:47:00.070]  We gotta have reg seeds because you gotta have the males
[02:47:00.070 --> 02:47:03.150]  to keep the breeding alive or it's gonna get stale.
[02:47:03.150 --> 02:47:04.710]  F1 hybrids are where it's at.
[02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:05.870]  You guys, if you're breeding,
[02:47:05.870 --> 02:47:07.070]  please throw away the bullshit.
[02:47:07.070 --> 02:47:08.030]  There's gonna be some stuff
[02:47:08.030 --> 02:47:09.470]  that comes out of your breeding projects
[02:47:09.470 --> 02:47:11.930]  that is not worth rebreeding or giving out those seeds.
[02:47:11.930 --> 02:47:12.770]  Just toss those,
[02:47:12.770 --> 02:47:14.150]  because you're polluting the gene pool,
[02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:15.510]  you're making it weak,
[02:47:15.510 --> 02:47:17.150]  you're making a bunch of runts and mutants,
[02:47:17.150 --> 02:47:17.970]  and you're fucking it up.
[02:47:17.970 --> 02:47:20.790]  Just get rid of all that non-elite stuff.
[02:47:20.790 --> 02:47:22.870]  Yeah, all the poser stuff and just kill it, dude.
[02:47:22.870 --> 02:47:23.710]  Just kill it.
[02:47:23.710 --> 02:47:24.530]  We can breed more seeds.
[02:47:24.530 --> 02:47:25.370]  There's more coming.
[02:47:25.370 --> 02:47:26.430]  I definitely give props to the people
[02:47:26.430 --> 02:47:29.070]  who actually try their own seeds.
[02:47:29.070 --> 02:47:32.550]  Like if you produce some seeds, actually grow it.
[02:47:32.550 --> 02:47:34.790]  See what it is before you give it to people.
[02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:35.710]  For sure.
[02:47:35.710 --> 02:47:37.790]  Give a bunch of it away also.
[02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:39.470]  Give them away so that other people can,
[02:47:39.470 --> 02:47:40.990]  so you can see what Nancy Budwell,
[02:47:40.990 --> 02:47:42.070]  shout out to Nancy Budwell.
[02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:42.910]  What she does.
[02:47:42.910 --> 02:47:43.750]  Shout out to Nancy.
[02:47:43.750 --> 02:47:47.790]  Man, that lady grows some fine cannabis under LEDs.
[02:47:47.790 --> 02:47:49.630]  I'm not even a big fan of LEDs,
[02:47:49.630 --> 02:47:51.830]  and she is killing it with that shit, bro.
[02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:52.670]  Yeah.
[02:47:52.670 --> 02:47:53.670]  Yeah, so, yeah, I'm actually,
[02:47:53.670 --> 02:47:54.510]  I like that you say that.
[02:47:54.510 --> 02:47:55.670]  You just keep saying good shit
[02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:56.950]  to make more good shit to talk about.
[02:47:56.950 --> 02:47:58.350]  I'm growing the night nurse right now.
[02:47:58.350 --> 02:47:59.710]  Dude, she looks stellar.
[02:47:59.710 --> 02:48:01.850]  There's one that looks really grateful dog dominant,
[02:48:01.890 --> 02:48:03.730]  but smells like Tora Bora.
[02:48:03.730 --> 02:48:05.410]  Maybe it'll pass those CBDs.
[02:48:05.410 --> 02:48:06.250]  Right, I hope so.
[02:48:06.250 --> 02:48:07.090]  I hope so.
[02:48:07.090 --> 02:48:09.170]  We need some good CBD medicine.
[02:48:09.170 --> 02:48:10.970]  So with the seeds, you get new stuff,
[02:48:10.970 --> 02:48:12.070]  like we were talking about.
[02:48:12.070 --> 02:48:13.810]  You get to do that phenotype hunt.
[02:48:14.770 --> 02:48:17.410]  That's essentially when you pop a pack of seeds.
[02:48:17.410 --> 02:48:19.410]  They call it mapping or searching or hunting.
[02:48:19.410 --> 02:48:21.090]  Subcool calls it something different.
[02:48:21.090 --> 02:48:22.170]  I forgot what he even calls it,
[02:48:22.170 --> 02:48:23.450]  but it's a phenotype hunt in this group,
[02:48:23.450 --> 02:48:24.650]  is what we call it.
[02:48:24.650 --> 02:48:26.850]  You run as many seeds as you can get of one strain.
[02:48:26.850 --> 02:48:28.490]  If you can do 20 of them, do 20.
[02:48:28.490 --> 02:48:29.330]  That's awesome.
[02:48:29.330 --> 02:48:31.290]  25 of something is cool.
[02:48:31.290 --> 02:48:33.730]  If you've only got a 10 or a six pack or a five pack,
[02:48:33.730 --> 02:48:34.570]  that works too.
[02:48:34.570 --> 02:48:35.410]  Just work on your scale.
[02:48:35.410 --> 02:48:36.610]  But the more, the better,
[02:48:36.610 --> 02:48:37.610]  because that gives you,
[02:48:37.610 --> 02:48:39.810]  you can see what that strain's potential is,
[02:48:39.810 --> 02:48:41.450]  and you know what you're looking for a little better,
[02:48:41.450 --> 02:48:43.810]  and you can get that one.
[02:48:43.810 --> 02:48:46.570]  I know what I want out of a grateful dog pack of beans.
[02:48:46.570 --> 02:48:48.490]  You may want something totally different
[02:48:48.490 --> 02:48:50.610]  out of a pack of dog beans,
[02:48:50.610 --> 02:48:52.810]  and we'll find it by doing that phenotype hunt.
[02:48:52.810 --> 02:48:54.370]  That's fun to me, running that hunt,
[02:48:54.370 --> 02:48:55.350]  seeing the variations.
[02:48:55.350 --> 02:48:56.190]  And as a breeder,
[02:48:56.190 --> 02:48:58.770]  I love seeing the variations from my creations.
[02:48:58.770 --> 02:49:00.370]  That's a lot of fun.
[02:49:00.370 --> 02:49:02.570]  If we're growing clones,
[02:49:02.570 --> 02:49:04.770]  we're all growing the same shit.
[02:49:04.770 --> 02:49:07.090]  There's a blue dream cut going around this town right now,
[02:49:07.090 --> 02:49:07.970]  going around Colorado.
[02:49:07.970 --> 02:49:08.810]  I don't think it's just this town.
[02:49:08.810 --> 02:49:12.050]  No, no, I think it is just Colorado in general.
[02:49:12.050 --> 02:49:14.410]  Every time I see somebody post a picture of blue dream,
[02:49:14.410 --> 02:49:16.050]  it's like, dear God, there it is again.
[02:49:16.050 --> 02:49:17.570]  It's the same blue dream.
[02:49:17.570 --> 02:49:19.650]  The thing harvests heavy.
[02:49:19.650 --> 02:49:20.490]  Oh yeah, I love it.
[02:49:20.490 --> 02:49:23.730]  It'll grow in any type of conditions,
[02:49:23.730 --> 02:49:26.730]  and she'll give you some product back if you're good to her.
[02:49:26.730 --> 02:49:27.570]  Oh yeah.
[02:49:27.570 --> 02:49:30.290]  I can pull six ounces out of a seven gallon pot
[02:49:31.110 --> 02:49:31.950]  with four of them per light.
[02:49:31.950 --> 02:49:33.690]  So that's a pound and a half of herb.
[02:49:33.690 --> 02:49:35.970]  Yeah, let her go about 70 days.
[02:49:35.970 --> 02:49:36.810]  She packs it on.
[02:49:36.810 --> 02:49:38.130]  Is that Andy's blue dream cut?
[02:49:38.130 --> 02:49:39.810]  Yeah, shout out to Andy.
[02:49:39.810 --> 02:49:40.650]  Shout out.
[02:49:40.650 --> 02:49:41.610]  What's up, ABD?
[02:49:41.610 --> 02:49:43.250]  Yeah, come get your stuff back.
[02:49:43.250 --> 02:49:47.010]  We're cool.
[02:49:47.010 --> 02:49:47.850]  We're done.
[02:49:47.850 --> 02:49:49.410]  We love it so much we hate it.
[02:49:49.410 --> 02:49:52.090]  It's so good that it's just terrible.
[02:49:52.090 --> 02:49:53.170]  No, we love the Andy's blue dream.
[02:49:53.170 --> 02:49:54.770]  I didn't mean to call it terrible.
[02:49:54.770 --> 02:49:57.010]  How about the cons of growing from seed?
[02:49:57.010 --> 02:49:59.090]  Some people are not good at spotting males.
[02:49:59.090 --> 02:50:00.650]  That's the main problem.
[02:50:00.650 --> 02:50:05.650]  Yeah, I would, I mean, if you're a beginner grower,
[02:50:05.730 --> 02:50:07.570]  you know, sometimes you don't even know.
[02:50:07.570 --> 02:50:09.250]  Like I know people that have seen male plants
[02:50:09.250 --> 02:50:11.610]  and like, is there ever going to be flowers from there?
[02:50:11.610 --> 02:50:13.090]  And it's like, no,
[02:50:13.090 --> 02:50:15.290]  these are two completely different things.
[02:50:16.250 --> 02:50:17.770]  And I just think it's about paying attention.
[02:50:17.770 --> 02:50:20.290]  If you pay attention, there's, you've got to see.
[02:50:20.290 --> 02:50:21.130]  Yeah.
[02:50:21.130 --> 02:50:21.970]  Read a book.
[02:50:21.970 --> 02:50:22.790]  Read a book.
[02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:24.530]  Yeah, every grow book has a picture of a male and a female
[02:50:24.530 --> 02:50:25.570]  right next to each other.
[02:50:25.570 --> 02:50:26.410]  Yep.
[02:50:26.410 --> 02:50:27.250]  Yep.
[02:50:27.250 --> 02:50:28.070]  So yeah, spot your males.
[02:50:28.070 --> 02:50:28.910]  What about mutants?
[02:50:29.750 --> 02:50:30.590]  What's your favorite thing about that crazy mutant shit?
[02:50:30.590 --> 02:50:31.430]  They're fun.
[02:50:31.430 --> 02:50:32.270]  They're funky.
[02:50:32.270 --> 02:50:33.910]  I think chem dog is a mutant.
[02:50:35.310 --> 02:50:36.670]  The person or the dog?
[02:50:36.670 --> 02:50:37.510]  Both.
[02:50:37.510 --> 02:50:38.350]  Both.
[02:50:40.230 --> 02:50:41.190]  Shout out to chem dog.
[02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:43.870]  And if you're writing chem dog, it's C-H-E-M-D-O-G.
[02:50:43.870 --> 02:50:44.790]  Yeah, D-O-G.
[02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:45.630]  He corrected us.
[02:50:45.630 --> 02:50:46.630]  It's D-O-G.
[02:50:46.630 --> 02:50:47.830]  Shout out chem dog.
[02:50:47.830 --> 02:50:49.310]  I used to have a dog named that.
[02:50:49.310 --> 02:50:50.350]  That's pretty awesome.
[02:50:50.350 --> 02:50:51.190]  No, D-O-G.
[02:50:51.190 --> 02:50:52.030]  D-O-G.
[02:50:52.030 --> 02:50:53.550]  My buddy Ryan had a dog named D-O-G.
[02:50:53.550 --> 02:50:55.230]  He was a cool ass dog.
[02:50:55.230 --> 02:50:56.070]  Cool dog.
[02:50:56.070 --> 02:50:56.890]  What's up guys?
[02:50:56.890 --> 02:50:57.730]  I miss you.
[02:50:57.730 --> 02:50:58.550]  I haven't seen you guys in a long time.
[02:50:59.190 --> 02:51:01.150]  Still thinking about you.
[02:51:01.150 --> 02:51:02.310]  Selection time.
[02:51:03.190 --> 02:51:04.190]  When you're growing from seeds,
[02:51:04.190 --> 02:51:05.590]  there's always that pheno hunt.
[02:51:05.590 --> 02:51:06.430]  When you're growing from clones,
[02:51:06.430 --> 02:51:08.410]  that first crop you're gonna grow, that's blue dream.
[02:51:08.410 --> 02:51:09.250]  You're cool.
[02:51:09.250 --> 02:51:10.950]  You got all the blue dream you can handle.
[02:51:10.950 --> 02:51:11.850]  When you're running from seed,
[02:51:11.850 --> 02:51:14.870]  you gotta run a crop to find what you're even messing with.
[02:51:14.870 --> 02:51:18.670]  And then run a crop to keep again of the ones you like.
[02:51:18.670 --> 02:51:19.510]  Right.
[02:51:19.510 --> 02:51:21.750]  And then if you need to eliminate more,
[02:51:21.750 --> 02:51:22.830]  then you're gonna run it again.
[02:51:22.830 --> 02:51:24.710]  Again and again and narrow it down.
[02:51:24.710 --> 02:51:25.550]  Yep.
[02:51:25.550 --> 02:51:27.750]  So, and then hopefully you take clones.
[02:51:27.750 --> 02:51:28.910]  Like I said on another episode,
[02:51:28.910 --> 02:51:31.230]  take clones of everything you ever grow.
[02:51:31.230 --> 02:51:32.430]  Before it's in flower.
[02:51:32.430 --> 02:51:33.990]  Right, before you flat, like yeah.
[02:51:33.990 --> 02:51:36.030]  15 days before you put it in flower, take some clones.
[02:51:36.030 --> 02:51:37.550]  That way you know those clones are gonna root.
[02:51:37.550 --> 02:51:40.230]  And if you don't have clones, you can try again.
[02:51:40.230 --> 02:51:41.910]  Like give yourself a chance.
[02:51:41.910 --> 02:51:42.730]  Plan ahead.
[02:51:42.730 --> 02:51:43.570]  Plan ahead when you're growing.
[02:51:43.570 --> 02:51:45.590]  It's always beneficial.
[02:51:45.590 --> 02:51:47.670]  Give yourself the advantage.
[02:51:47.670 --> 02:51:48.510]  Yeah.
[02:51:48.510 --> 02:51:49.330]  Yeah, the advantage.
[02:51:49.330 --> 02:51:51.070]  The heads up for yourself is don't put yourself behind.
[02:51:51.070 --> 02:51:52.190]  Because once you're behind in growing,
[02:51:52.190 --> 02:51:53.510]  you're behind in growing.
[02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:55.870]  And that probably means your plants are stressed out.
[02:51:55.870 --> 02:51:57.730]  Yeah, if you're stressed, they are.
[02:51:58.570 --> 02:51:59.410]  You ain't lying.
[02:51:59.410 --> 02:52:00.230]  Ha ha ha.
[02:52:00.230 --> 02:52:01.070]  Ha ha ha.
[02:52:01.070 --> 02:52:02.570]  Ha ha ha.
[02:52:02.570 --> 02:52:04.490]  So, the cons of seeds.
[02:52:04.490 --> 02:52:07.330]  If you need, you gotta learn each phenotype.
[02:52:07.330 --> 02:52:08.690]  Like when you find those phenotypes,
[02:52:08.690 --> 02:52:10.130]  you gotta learn them and you gotta learn.
[02:52:10.130 --> 02:52:12.010]  It's like having three different girlfriends
[02:52:12.010 --> 02:52:13.050]  if you found three keepers.
[02:52:13.050 --> 02:52:14.610]  One's gonna like a lot of nitrogen.
[02:52:14.610 --> 02:52:16.510]  One's gonna get mad at too much nitrogen.
[02:52:16.510 --> 02:52:17.930]  One's gonna be really picky.
[02:52:17.930 --> 02:52:19.490]  One's gonna be really easy.
[02:52:19.490 --> 02:52:20.410]  One's gonna butt out.
[02:52:20.410 --> 02:52:22.010]  One's gonna taste real good.
[02:52:22.010 --> 02:52:23.610]  You're gonna have to learn each phenotype.
[02:52:23.610 --> 02:52:24.890]  One may go a little longer.
[02:52:24.890 --> 02:52:26.870]  One may come down a little sooner.
[02:52:26.910 --> 02:52:28.030]  One may need to be topped.
[02:52:28.030 --> 02:52:30.550]  One may climb up into the fucking lights real high.
[02:52:30.550 --> 02:52:32.390]  You gotta learn all that stuff.
[02:52:32.390 --> 02:52:35.350]  The con, of course, that comes with that is wasted space.
[02:52:35.350 --> 02:52:37.310]  So, if you're a cash cropper,
[02:52:37.310 --> 02:52:40.350]  the seeds, that kind of messes you up.
[02:52:40.350 --> 02:52:41.630]  But what about fem seeds?
[02:52:42.830 --> 02:52:44.030]  I've seen it.
[02:52:44.030 --> 02:52:45.790]  I mean, I've grown fem seeds.
[02:52:45.790 --> 02:52:46.630]  I don't know.
[02:52:46.630 --> 02:52:47.470]  I've made tons of fem seeds.
[02:52:47.470 --> 02:52:52.470]  They are, they take away the worry about having a male.
[02:52:53.470 --> 02:52:55.670]  There are still chances where you'll get some funky stuff,
[02:52:55.670 --> 02:52:57.390]  but you just gotta still pay attention.
[02:52:57.390 --> 02:52:58.670]  I've made some funky stuff.
[02:52:58.670 --> 02:53:00.430]  You've grown some funky stuff for me
[02:53:00.430 --> 02:53:02.910]  that I'm not even gonna say the strain to discourage anybody.
[02:53:02.910 --> 02:53:05.070]  But it's still good though, don't worry.
[02:53:05.070 --> 02:53:07.310]  Yeah, because I'm seeing excellent phenotypes coming out.
[02:53:07.310 --> 02:53:10.190]  I've got some downstairs that looks gnarly.
[02:53:10.190 --> 02:53:11.550]  Spence grew one that shot out.
[02:53:11.550 --> 02:53:14.430]  It was shot out a stick with a gigantic leaf,
[02:53:14.430 --> 02:53:16.390]  the size of bigger than my hand,
[02:53:16.390 --> 02:53:19.470]  and then another stick, and then normal size leaves.
[02:53:19.470 --> 02:53:20.750]  Then I don't even remember what went on,
[02:53:20.750 --> 02:53:21.870]  because I just looked away.
[02:53:21.870 --> 02:53:23.270]  I was like, man.
[02:53:23.270 --> 02:53:24.870]  It was like seeing a car wreck.
[02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:26.510]  You can look for a minute, but then you're like, fuck.
[02:53:26.510 --> 02:53:30.910]  It had a reattach amputee arm, but it was cool.
[02:53:30.910 --> 02:53:33.590]  Sometimes I like things like that.
[02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:35.950]  If it's gonna be a female, I'm the type of girl
[02:53:35.950 --> 02:53:37.150]  where I'll give it a chance.
[02:53:37.150 --> 02:53:39.630]  If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
[02:53:39.630 --> 02:53:41.150]  There's always more seeds to plant.
[02:53:41.150 --> 02:53:42.230]  There are always more seeds.
[02:53:42.230 --> 02:53:44.150]  Yeah, don't be afraid to call something, man.
[02:53:44.150 --> 02:53:46.430]  If you guys have something that is a level eight,
[02:53:46.430 --> 02:53:48.470]  let's work on getting you guys a level 10
[02:53:48.470 --> 02:53:49.710]  on your seed pack. Yeah, go find that 10.
[02:53:49.710 --> 02:53:53.070]  Yeah, get you some good seeds, some regulars or fins.
[02:53:53.510 --> 02:53:56.310]  Exactly, survival of the fittest.
[02:53:56.310 --> 02:53:57.550]  Survival of the fittest.
[02:53:57.550 --> 02:53:58.710]  I know seeds are expensive,
[02:53:58.710 --> 02:54:00.270]  and we just talk like you could just pop more,
[02:54:00.270 --> 02:54:02.270]  but it's well worth it.
[02:54:02.270 --> 02:54:04.230]  And if you're growing herb, you should be doing all right.
[02:54:04.230 --> 02:54:06.110]  You should at least be able to afford a pack of seeds
[02:54:06.110 --> 02:54:07.270]  after the harvest.
[02:54:07.270 --> 02:54:08.430]  So I mentioned fem seeds.
[02:54:08.430 --> 02:54:10.270]  Fem seeds, just a quick little,
[02:54:11.710 --> 02:54:12.750]  that's a red rat in the background there.
[02:54:12.750 --> 02:54:13.590]  That got my attention.
[02:54:13.590 --> 02:54:14.430]  We're gonna turn up the music.
[02:54:14.430 --> 02:54:15.750]  We're gonna dance around like Wookiees for a second.
[02:54:15.750 --> 02:54:16.590]  Here we go.
[02:54:18.230 --> 02:54:19.230]  All right, let's take a dab.
[02:54:19.230 --> 02:54:20.310]  We'll remember where we were.
[02:54:20.310 --> 02:54:21.190]  Take a dab with us, guys.
[02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:22.950]  We got some really cool ass people in the room today.
[02:54:23.790 --> 02:54:25.270]  I'm really honored to have these guys as guests.
[02:54:25.270 --> 02:54:26.790]  I got some acid in the car.
[02:54:27.990 --> 02:54:29.990]  You just said dance around like Wookiees.
[02:54:30.990 --> 02:54:32.790]  Wow, that was a really random statement
[02:54:32.790 --> 02:54:33.990]  to say on a recording.
[02:54:33.990 --> 02:54:35.470]  I'm really high, so.
[02:54:37.030 --> 02:54:37.870]  He didn't mean that.
[02:54:37.870 --> 02:54:38.710]  That was a joke.
[02:54:38.710 --> 02:54:41.750]  Yeah, I actually, battery acid.
[02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:44.270]  Yeah, I'm gonna grab this torch out of your way.
[02:54:44.270 --> 02:54:45.310]  It was a joke, guys.
[02:54:46.950 --> 02:54:48.550]  Which rig you going for, Spence?
[02:54:50.670 --> 02:54:51.510]  Do it.
[02:54:51.510 --> 02:54:52.350]  You can hit the hitman.
[02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:55.270]  With the highly educated titanium domeless nail.
[02:54:55.270 --> 02:54:56.150]  There's some stuff in the works
[02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:57.910]  with highly educated right now.
[02:55:00.430 --> 02:55:02.470]  There's that classic reggae air horn.
[02:55:02.470 --> 02:55:03.310]  Gotta love it.
[02:55:05.030 --> 02:55:06.190]  I know, we were doing a podcast.
[02:55:06.190 --> 02:55:07.990]  Now suddenly we're taking a break and dabbing, guys.
[02:55:07.990 --> 02:55:10.150]  I hope you like the way potheads work.
[02:55:10.150 --> 02:55:11.950]  I hope you're taking a dab while I am too.
[02:55:11.950 --> 02:55:12.990]  That'd only be right.
[02:55:16.310 --> 02:55:17.230]  Grab that beer rig, Jess.
[02:55:17.230 --> 02:55:18.070]  Take a dab with us.
[02:55:18.070 --> 02:55:19.670]  We'll have a three rig session.
[02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:22.230]  There aren't three torches, but we'll make it happen.
[02:55:28.130 --> 02:55:30.530]  That's some Terp X, if you want that.
[02:55:30.530 --> 02:55:32.010]  There's some live over there.
[02:55:33.090 --> 02:55:35.010]  Yeah, we're spoiled here in Colorado.
[02:55:37.720 --> 02:55:40.840]  If we were in Texas, this table would equal life in prison.
[02:55:42.280 --> 02:55:44.200]  And you're black, so that's two lives.
[02:55:44.200 --> 02:55:45.800]  Hey, you won't catch me there.
[02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:46.880]  I promise that.
[02:55:52.540 --> 02:55:56.020]  The best thing about Texas is seeing the state line
[02:55:56.020 --> 02:55:57.020]  in your rear view.
[02:55:58.260 --> 02:55:59.100]  I won't.
[02:55:59.100 --> 02:55:59.940]  I don't have a reason to go to Texas
[02:55:59.940 --> 02:56:01.380]  or a reason to hate on Texas, really.
[02:56:01.900 --> 02:56:02.740]  I don't have a reason to go there.
[02:56:02.740 --> 02:56:03.580]  They got some bomb food
[02:56:03.580 --> 02:56:05.780]  and people down there know how to party.
[02:56:05.780 --> 02:56:06.820]  You know what, I've got some good friends
[02:56:06.820 --> 02:56:09.180]  that are from Texas and they're actually all good people.
[02:56:09.180 --> 02:56:10.820]  I just lost my headphones.
[02:56:10.820 --> 02:56:13.220]  They die out, we'll tap on the thing, they'll work again.
[02:56:13.220 --> 02:56:14.060]  Word.
[02:56:27.630 --> 02:56:28.870]  Headphones working, bro?
[02:56:29.950 --> 02:56:30.790]  Cool.
[02:56:30.790 --> 02:56:33.270]  Yeah, if you guys are buying gear for a podcast,
[02:56:33.270 --> 02:56:35.310]  never buy a Live Wire Solutions headphone,
[02:56:35.310 --> 02:56:37.070]  four channel stereo headphone amplifier.
[02:56:37.070 --> 02:56:38.510]  It's a piece of shit.
[02:56:38.510 --> 02:56:40.390]  This is the third one I've gotten, dude.
[02:56:40.390 --> 02:56:41.990]  And I know you're like, why'd you get a third one?
[02:56:42.790 --> 02:56:43.630]  Because if you go to Guitar Center with it
[02:56:43.630 --> 02:56:44.950]  and you yell at them, they keep just giving you a fresh one.
[02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:47.070]  So just keep reusing it.
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:54.360]  All right, so three people just smoked a gram of hash
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:56.600]  and like three dabs, one dab each.
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:56:59.840]  I got some on my phone I'm gonna take later.
[02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:04.400]  Your phone is probably the only thing
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:07.160]  without hash on it up until now.
[02:57:07.160 --> 02:57:08.560]  Pretty much.
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:10.080]  My life.
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:11.040]  Everything is all sticky.
[02:57:11.040 --> 02:57:12.360]  I wanted to call the recording studio
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:13.760]  the Sticky Knob Studios.
[02:57:14.880 --> 02:57:16.200]  That sounds a little bit funky.
[02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:19.280]  I thought people might take that wrong.
[02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:20.120]  Brown chicka brown.
[02:57:20.120 --> 02:57:21.880]  Brown chicka brown.
[02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:23.480]  That part of the show is brought to you by Oil Slick.
[02:57:23.480 --> 02:57:26.280]  Oil Slick, tools to help you concentrate.
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:29.160]  I just set my stuff down on this fancy Oil Slick pad here.
[02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:31.040]  I'm not gonna get any sticky rings on my table.
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:31.880]  That's awesome.
[02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:33.880]  That's a really nice Oil Slick pad there.
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:36.480]  Yeah, hey, don't you work at a hydro shop?
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:37.920]  What were they called again?
[02:57:37.920 --> 02:57:38.760]  Hygro.
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:40.960]  They're called Hygro Pueblo.
[02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:42.920]  Check out Hygro, they're awesome over there.
[02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:44.400]  Jesse does a lot of lifting and moving,
[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:46.280]  so all the organization and stuff,
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:47.560]  give shout outs to Jesse.
[02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:51.000]  We're working in the fucking hot Colorado heat.
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:52.040]  It's August 9th.
[02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:54.280]  I wanna give a quick shout out to Jerry Garcia.
[02:57:54.280 --> 02:57:55.120]  Oh yeah.
[02:57:55.120 --> 02:57:56.760]  Much love, much respect, Jerry Garcia.
[02:57:56.760 --> 02:57:57.840]  Jerry changed my life, dude.
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:57:59.880]  I never got to see Jerry live,
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:01.200]  but the music of the Grateful Dead
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:02.280]  and the culture of the Grateful Dead
[02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:04.000]  are definitely in my heart.
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.120]  That is a big part of my world.
[02:58:06.120 --> 02:58:07.480]  So we'll get back to the point here.
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:09.960]  Podcast time, Feminize Seeds,
[02:58:09.960 --> 02:58:12.360]  always females most of the time.
[02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:14.320]  I'll say 99% of the time females.
[02:58:14.320 --> 02:58:16.240]  Jesse told us a story before about
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:19.440]  a dispensary owner running 200 and something Feminize Seeds
[02:58:19.440 --> 02:58:20.960]  and having four males.
[02:58:20.960 --> 02:58:23.360]  Perfect math, fucked up everything.
[02:58:23.360 --> 02:58:25.120]  Yeah, did you get a bunch of seeds?
[02:58:26.240 --> 02:58:27.080]  What was that?
[02:58:27.080 --> 02:58:29.640]  Sorry, dab hit kinda.
[02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:31.240]  I just saw your brain go blank.
[02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:33.640]  Like when you're at a house
[02:58:33.640 --> 02:58:35.120]  and your fucking ballast clicks in
[02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:36.520]  and the lights go dim real quick,
[02:58:36.520 --> 02:58:38.560]  you just went blink and you came back right fast.
[02:58:38.560 --> 02:58:40.480]  Like where were we?
[02:58:40.480 --> 02:58:41.720]  Did you get a bunch of seeds from that run?
[02:58:41.760 --> 02:58:43.200]  Where the dispensary owner fucked it all up?
[02:58:43.200 --> 02:58:44.800]  Yeah, they had a bunch of seeds.
[02:58:44.800 --> 02:58:45.720]  Oh man.
[02:58:45.720 --> 02:58:48.520]  And then they tried to sell them too.
[02:58:48.520 --> 02:58:49.680]  Well, that's a dispensary for you.
[02:58:49.680 --> 02:58:51.120]  Yeah, they had no idea.
[02:58:51.120 --> 02:58:52.520]  And the problem with Femseeds,
[02:58:52.520 --> 02:58:53.800]  me being a Feminize Seed maker,
[02:58:53.800 --> 02:58:54.920]  I know this is the big problem.
[02:58:54.920 --> 02:58:56.760]  You don't know you've got a problem
[02:58:56.760 --> 02:58:58.640]  until like week seven or week eight
[02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:02.400]  when you've already invested a lot of time into that plant.
[02:59:02.400 --> 02:59:04.640]  So if you're running Femseeds, my advice,
[02:59:04.640 --> 02:59:06.440]  and this is what I do, I flower them little.
[02:59:06.440 --> 02:59:07.760]  I run them in a three gallon pot.
[02:59:07.760 --> 02:59:09.200]  I veg them for very minimal time
[02:59:09.200 --> 02:59:11.200]  until I can take three cuts off of them.
[02:59:11.720 --> 02:59:12.720]  And once they're all big enough for three cuts,
[02:59:12.720 --> 02:59:15.400]  I flower them out the first time to find out what I've got.
[02:59:15.400 --> 02:59:17.520]  And then you can find out if you've got trouble
[02:59:17.520 --> 02:59:18.880]  or if you've got gold.
[02:59:18.880 --> 02:59:22.560]  So go early with the Femseeds if you can, just to find out.
[02:59:22.560 --> 02:59:24.080]  I would do that with any plant.
[02:59:25.240 --> 02:59:28.320]  I've had some fire seeds from Fem.
[02:59:28.320 --> 02:59:29.280]  That's an odd noise.
[02:59:29.280 --> 02:59:30.360]  You all hear that?
[02:59:30.360 --> 02:59:31.800]  That could be Spence's phone.
[02:59:31.800 --> 02:59:33.840]  Somebody was growing hops.
[02:59:33.840 --> 02:59:34.840]  That shit was tight.
[02:59:34.840 --> 02:59:35.680]  On your phone?
[02:59:35.680 --> 02:59:36.520]  Yeah.
[02:59:36.520 --> 02:59:37.340]  Growing hops?
[02:59:37.340 --> 02:59:38.180]  Yeah.
[02:59:38.180 --> 02:59:39.000]  It looked like weed?
[02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:39.840]  It's related to weed.
[02:59:39.840 --> 02:59:41.120]  It's like the cousin.
[02:59:42.040 --> 02:59:44.240]  It's kind of like a black cousin.
[02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:45.280]  A viney plant.
[02:59:45.280 --> 02:59:46.520]  That's my nigga hops.
[02:59:48.240 --> 02:59:49.080]  I could say that.
[02:59:49.080 --> 02:59:50.320]  Spence said I could say that.
[02:59:50.320 --> 02:59:51.160]  I could say that.
[02:59:51.160 --> 02:59:52.280]  It's cool.
[02:59:52.280 --> 02:59:54.120]  I can't believe I just said that on the podcast though.
[02:59:54.120 --> 02:59:54.960]  It's all good.
[02:59:54.960 --> 02:59:55.800]  It's cool.
[02:59:55.800 --> 02:59:57.360]  He makes me say shout out to my nigga Spence.
[02:59:57.360 --> 03:00:00.520]  I gave him his pass a year and a half ago.
[03:00:00.520 --> 03:00:01.680]  It's okay.
[03:00:01.680 --> 03:00:03.360]  Yeah, I got my pass y'all.
[03:00:03.360 --> 03:00:05.320]  That's funny you guys brought up beer.
[03:00:05.320 --> 03:00:06.720]  Whoa.
[03:00:07.560 --> 03:00:08.400]  Nice.
[03:00:08.400 --> 03:00:09.220]  You can hear now?
[03:00:09.220 --> 03:00:10.060]  Yeah, it's starting to work in me.
[03:00:10.060 --> 03:00:10.940]  I can kind of hear now.
[03:00:10.940 --> 03:00:12.580]  I can really hear.
[03:00:12.580 --> 03:00:13.940]  I have a beer making friend
[03:00:14.860 --> 03:00:17.020]  and we had a serious conversation last night
[03:00:17.020 --> 03:00:18.600]  about making a marijuana beer.
[03:00:20.060 --> 03:00:22.140]  I don't drink but I would try one of those.
[03:00:22.140 --> 03:00:22.960]  Yeah.
[03:00:22.960 --> 03:00:24.060]  Just to say I drank a marijuana beer.
[03:00:24.060 --> 03:00:24.900]  One?
[03:00:24.900 --> 03:00:25.740]  Uh huh.
[03:00:25.740 --> 03:00:26.940]  Spence and I might split it.
[03:00:26.940 --> 03:00:28.060]  Yeah, for sure.
[03:00:28.060 --> 03:00:30.140]  I get a little turnt off one beer.
[03:00:30.140 --> 03:00:33.240]  We were talking about like a really small recipe so.
[03:00:34.260 --> 03:00:36.460]  And then you could ferment that beer in your grow room
[03:00:36.460 --> 03:00:39.940]  and use your weed beer CO2 to enhance your ganja plants.
[03:00:40.780 --> 03:00:41.900]  Would that be a little sacrilegious?
[03:00:41.900 --> 03:00:43.160]  Cannibalistic almost?
[03:00:45.380 --> 03:00:46.740]  Here's your fermenting brothers.
[03:00:46.740 --> 03:00:47.940]  If you want it to be.
[03:00:47.940 --> 03:00:48.980]  If you want it to be.
[03:00:50.140 --> 03:00:50.980]  All right.
[03:00:52.980 --> 03:00:53.860]  Shout out to beer.
[03:00:53.860 --> 03:00:54.680]  I miss you beer.
[03:00:54.680 --> 03:00:55.900]  I haven't had a beer in a long, long time.
[03:00:55.900 --> 03:00:57.180]  I'm better off without it.
[03:00:57.180 --> 03:00:58.020]  You know, I haven't had a beer
[03:00:58.020 --> 03:01:00.700]  since I got my very first medical marijuana card.
[03:01:00.700 --> 03:01:02.420]  That's when I was like, you know, I don't need to drink.
[03:01:02.420 --> 03:01:03.420]  I got the card.
[03:01:03.420 --> 03:01:04.740]  Smoke all the herb I want.
[03:01:04.740 --> 03:01:05.580]  That's awesome.
[03:01:05.580 --> 03:01:06.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:07.500]  Nice trade off with myself.
[03:01:07.500 --> 03:01:08.740]  My dad kind of sorted it.
[03:01:08.740 --> 03:01:09.980]  It's the same thing.
[03:01:09.980 --> 03:01:11.260]  He still drinks occasionally.
[03:01:11.260 --> 03:01:12.180]  Shout out to Mr. Witt.
[03:01:12.180 --> 03:01:15.100]  If you're listening to the show, man, what's up bro?
[03:01:15.100 --> 03:01:16.020]  It's me.
[03:01:16.020 --> 03:01:17.660]  What's up pops?
[03:01:17.660 --> 03:01:19.460]  He's a cool ass dude.
[03:01:19.460 --> 03:01:20.780]  Cool ass dude.
[03:01:20.780 --> 03:01:24.460]  So we're kind of ran about fem seeds a little bit.
[03:01:24.460 --> 03:01:25.940]  Fem seeds I've noticed, and you might,
[03:01:25.940 --> 03:01:28.300]  you guys, I don't know if you've paid enough attention.
[03:01:28.300 --> 03:01:30.020]  Cause I'm looking more, I'm the breeder.
[03:01:30.020 --> 03:01:32.640]  Fem seeds are always a closer representation
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:34.220]  of the parents I have found.
[03:01:34.220 --> 03:01:35.620]  You don't get as much.
[03:01:35.620 --> 03:01:37.540]  Like when we run gauges F1s.
[03:01:37.540 --> 03:01:40.860]  There's not as much variation as what you're saying.
[03:01:40.860 --> 03:01:41.700]  Right.
[03:01:41.700 --> 03:01:42.900]  Fem seeds are more uniform.
[03:01:42.900 --> 03:01:43.740]  They're closer.
[03:01:43.740 --> 03:01:44.560]  They look a lot alike.
[03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:45.580]  When we run gauges F1s,
[03:01:45.580 --> 03:01:47.160]  we never know what we're going to get.
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:50.420]  A 10 pack varies so much, unless it was aspirar.
[03:01:50.420 --> 03:01:51.460]  Those were awesome.
[03:01:51.460 --> 03:01:53.300]  Do you suppose that's because they are
[03:01:54.420 --> 03:01:56.940]  supposedly missing the male chromosomes?
[03:01:56.940 --> 03:01:59.100]  That, and you're not introducing,
[03:01:59.100 --> 03:02:02.580]  it feels like when you're bringing out the F1s,
[03:02:02.580 --> 03:02:04.780]  I feel like you're getting a lot of recessive traits
[03:02:04.780 --> 03:02:05.860]  and you're just not bringing,
[03:02:05.860 --> 03:02:09.060]  it could be because of the male chromosomes are missing,
[03:02:09.060 --> 03:02:11.100]  but it feels like you're not going back as far
[03:02:11.100 --> 03:02:11.940]  in the lineage.
[03:02:11.940 --> 03:02:13.940]  They forgot who their grandparents were somehow
[03:02:13.940 --> 03:02:14.940]  just by selfing them.
[03:02:14.940 --> 03:02:16.260]  It's what it feels like.
[03:02:16.260 --> 03:02:20.260]  And I'm also doing a lot of selfing of one plant
[03:02:20.260 --> 03:02:22.580]  and using it to pollinate the same strain.
[03:02:22.580 --> 03:02:23.860]  So those are starting to come out.
[03:02:23.860 --> 03:02:24.960]  I've done that.
[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:27.460]  I'm on the, it's inbred,
[03:02:27.460 --> 03:02:29.780]  but it's kind of an F3 is what level I'm at.
[03:02:29.780 --> 03:02:30.620]  And they're-
[03:02:30.620 --> 03:02:31.460]  So S3.
[03:02:31.460 --> 03:02:32.300]  Yeah.
[03:02:32.300 --> 03:02:33.740]  The Grateful Dog S3,
[03:02:33.740 --> 03:02:36.100]  they are almost all looking the same by now.
[03:02:36.100 --> 03:02:36.940]  Oh, nice.
[03:02:36.940 --> 03:02:37.780]  Yeah.
[03:02:37.780 --> 03:02:38.600]  I had no idea.
[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:39.440]  Awesome, props on that.
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:40.280]  Well, thank you.
[03:02:40.280 --> 03:02:41.100]  Thank you.
[03:02:41.100 --> 03:02:41.940]  That's a dank strain, by the way.
[03:02:41.940 --> 03:02:42.780]  Yeah.
[03:02:42.780 --> 03:02:44.100]  That's the one that put me on the map, honestly.
[03:02:44.100 --> 03:02:46.060]  Shout out to the Cali Connection and Swerve
[03:02:46.060 --> 03:02:48.080]  because just shout out to those guys.
[03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:48.920]  They did me a favor.
[03:02:48.920 --> 03:02:49.740]  So shout out.
[03:02:51.100 --> 03:02:53.860]  Yeah, I was going to actually bring up in this conversation
[03:02:53.860 --> 03:02:57.380]  that there's so many S1s and F1s out there.
[03:02:57.380 --> 03:03:02.180]  And, you know, we were talking about protecting the lineage
[03:03:02.180 --> 03:03:03.260]  and everything.
[03:03:03.780 --> 03:03:06.780]  And you can't really do that with F1s, S1s.
[03:03:06.780 --> 03:03:07.620]  So.
[03:03:07.620 --> 03:03:08.440]  Yeah, you got to F3 it.
[03:03:08.440 --> 03:03:09.280]  You got to get to F3.
[03:03:09.280 --> 03:03:10.740]  F3, F4, you know.
[03:03:10.740 --> 03:03:12.660]  DJ Short says F2 is crucial.
[03:03:12.660 --> 03:03:13.500]  Really?
[03:03:13.500 --> 03:03:14.700]  That's where a lot of stuff is really
[03:03:14.700 --> 03:03:15.660]  where you got to pay attention.
[03:03:15.660 --> 03:03:18.300]  Cause I've fucked up the F2s.
[03:03:18.300 --> 03:03:19.940]  I've been like, oh no, I used the wrong,
[03:03:19.940 --> 03:03:24.020]  I chose the wrong F1 to put to that.
[03:03:24.020 --> 03:03:25.580]  And then was like, nope, that's not,
[03:03:25.580 --> 03:03:27.800]  I got to go find a different male out of this mix.
[03:03:27.800 --> 03:03:28.640]  Cause this is not,
[03:03:28.640 --> 03:03:30.540]  or a different female and try this again.
[03:03:30.540 --> 03:03:31.380]  For sure.
[03:03:31.380 --> 03:03:32.900]  You just have to go back.
[03:03:33.540 --> 03:03:34.500]  You have to keep seeds of each one
[03:03:34.500 --> 03:03:36.120]  and label them what they were.
[03:03:36.120 --> 03:03:40.020]  Like this is the, I'll say golden goat times daybreaker.
[03:03:40.020 --> 03:03:42.780]  This is the first run and make sure that those are legit.
[03:03:42.780 --> 03:03:43.620]  And then find a good,
[03:03:43.620 --> 03:03:45.540]  I want to find a golden goat dominant one out of there
[03:03:45.540 --> 03:03:47.700]  and hit it again with the daybreaker male.
[03:03:47.700 --> 03:03:51.780]  And I'm hoping to make it look a lot like daybreaker
[03:03:51.780 --> 03:03:53.100]  and smell like golden goat.
[03:03:53.100 --> 03:03:54.260]  I have the goats.
[03:03:54.260 --> 03:03:55.500]  The goat vigor.
[03:03:55.500 --> 03:03:58.740]  But if it doesn't, I could just have to back up again
[03:03:58.740 --> 03:04:00.820]  and go find another female to use and just keep.
[03:04:00.820 --> 03:04:01.660]  For sure.
[03:04:01.660 --> 03:04:02.900]  Eventually I'll ditch a project
[03:04:02.900 --> 03:04:05.300]  if I have to go back too many times, twice.
[03:04:05.300 --> 03:04:06.860]  If I don't get it the first or second time,
[03:04:06.860 --> 03:04:08.420]  I'm like, yeah, that obviously doesn't want to do
[03:04:08.420 --> 03:04:09.780]  what I want it to do.
[03:04:09.780 --> 03:04:10.600]  Out of so many seeds,
[03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:12.420]  you should get what you want the first or second,
[03:04:12.420 --> 03:04:14.020]  first or second try.
[03:04:14.020 --> 03:04:17.340]  I, the depot dog strain I had or have,
[03:04:18.260 --> 03:04:21.060]  I had to do it three times before I was happy with it
[03:04:21.060 --> 03:04:21.980]  the first time.
[03:04:21.980 --> 03:04:22.800]  There you go.
[03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:23.640]  And then continued from there.
[03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:25.060]  Yeah.
[03:04:25.060 --> 03:04:26.940]  Due to like leaks and stuff like that.
[03:04:26.940 --> 03:04:28.140]  Oh man. Yeah.
[03:04:28.140 --> 03:04:30.540]  And something in me says if it doesn't work the first time
[03:04:30.580 --> 03:04:31.420]  or the second time,
[03:04:31.420 --> 03:04:33.660]  I'm probably not going to get what I want.
[03:04:33.660 --> 03:04:35.220]  I keep cutting that music out a little too much.
[03:04:35.220 --> 03:04:36.740]  Sorry.
[03:04:36.740 --> 03:04:39.300]  Here's a random, this is kind of off topic, but on topic,
[03:04:39.300 --> 03:04:40.140]  how do you guys feel?
[03:04:40.140 --> 03:04:41.980]  Have you seen where Aryan goes to places?
[03:04:41.980 --> 03:04:43.420]  Aryan from greenhouse seeds.
[03:04:43.420 --> 03:04:45.860]  They travel to places and get land race genetics
[03:04:45.860 --> 03:04:47.140]  from I'll say Jamaica.
[03:04:47.140 --> 03:04:48.240]  And they went to like,
[03:04:49.460 --> 03:04:51.180]  they went to somewhere in India, Nepal
[03:04:51.180 --> 03:04:52.020]  or somewhere like that.
[03:04:52.020 --> 03:04:53.140]  I don't pay enough attention.
[03:04:53.140 --> 03:04:55.580]  I just have to watch things quickly while I'm trimming.
[03:04:55.580 --> 03:04:56.700]  So they go to these places
[03:04:56.700 --> 03:04:59.220]  and they get their land race seeds.
[03:04:59.220 --> 03:05:02.940]  And so now Aryan's got all land races from everywhere,
[03:05:03.820 --> 03:05:07.460]  but in exchange, he leaves them a handful of-
[03:05:07.460 --> 03:05:08.300]  Reg seeds.
[03:05:08.300 --> 03:05:09.120]  Fem seeds.
[03:05:09.120 --> 03:05:09.960]  Fem seeds.
[03:05:09.960 --> 03:05:10.780]  Fem seeds and regs.
[03:05:10.780 --> 03:05:11.900]  He'll give them a fems and regs,
[03:05:11.900 --> 03:05:13.660]  but he gives them handfuls of seeds to grow
[03:05:13.660 --> 03:05:15.540]  and he tells them what they are.
[03:05:15.540 --> 03:05:18.060]  But now those land races are gone.
[03:05:18.060 --> 03:05:18.900]  Yeah.
[03:05:18.900 --> 03:05:19.740]  Because they're crossed back over.
[03:05:19.740 --> 03:05:20.560]  Yeah.
[03:05:20.560 --> 03:05:21.740]  It's just open pollination of it.
[03:05:21.740 --> 03:05:22.580]  They don't care.
[03:05:22.580 --> 03:05:24.260]  And he just made off with the last of them.
[03:05:24.260 --> 03:05:26.140]  With the last of the land race seeds.
[03:05:26.140 --> 03:05:30.700]  Introducing hybrids and modern and developed world genetics
[03:05:30.700 --> 03:05:34.420]  into fragile places that have land race genetics like that
[03:05:34.420 --> 03:05:35.260]  is a,
[03:05:37.300 --> 03:05:39.820]  that's kind of a douchebag thing to do.
[03:05:39.820 --> 03:05:41.660]  That's the nicest way I can say it.
[03:05:41.660 --> 03:05:45.820]  It's the same thing as releasing fucking animals
[03:05:45.820 --> 03:05:47.100]  that are not from that area.
[03:05:47.100 --> 03:05:47.940]  Yeah.
[03:05:47.940 --> 03:05:48.780]  For sure.
[03:05:48.780 --> 03:05:49.600]  Or insects that are not from that area.
[03:05:49.600 --> 03:05:50.700]  They're going to wreak havoc on shit
[03:05:50.700 --> 03:05:52.380]  and destroy the ecosystem that's already there
[03:05:52.380 --> 03:05:53.740]  and disrupt the balance.
[03:05:54.100 --> 03:05:56.860]  Or asking all the farmers to grow some GMO corn.
[03:05:56.860 --> 03:05:57.700]  Yeah.
[03:05:57.700 --> 03:05:59.140]  He's kind of doing the same thing to them.
[03:05:59.140 --> 03:05:59.980]  Yeah.
[03:05:59.980 --> 03:06:01.140]  Yeah.
[03:06:01.140 --> 03:06:03.620]  You guys think about that when you're doing what you're doing.
[03:06:03.620 --> 03:06:05.100]  Kind of think about the effects that you're having,
[03:06:05.100 --> 03:06:06.680]  like the ripples that you make in your life.
[03:06:06.680 --> 03:06:09.900]  Because little stuff makes big, big ripples.
[03:06:09.900 --> 03:06:13.020]  What's that saying about a butterfly in the rain forest
[03:06:13.020 --> 03:06:14.980]  and a monsoon somewhere else?
[03:06:14.980 --> 03:06:15.820]  Yeah.
[03:06:15.820 --> 03:06:16.640]  Yeah.
[03:06:16.640 --> 03:06:18.900]  If a hippie scratches his nuts in Pueblo,
[03:06:18.900 --> 03:06:20.460]  there's a tidal wave in China somewhere.
[03:06:20.460 --> 03:06:22.060]  Something like that happens.
[03:06:22.060 --> 03:06:22.900]  Yeah.
[03:06:22.900 --> 03:06:23.740]  Keep that in mind.
[03:06:23.740 --> 03:06:24.580]  Yeah.
[03:06:24.580 --> 03:06:25.740]  So all you hippies scratching your nuts,
[03:06:25.740 --> 03:06:27.660]  be careful, you're causing tidal waves.
[03:06:27.660 --> 03:06:28.500]  All right.
[03:06:28.500 --> 03:06:31.580]  So that was a random rant on the pros and cons of seed.
[03:06:31.580 --> 03:06:35.060]  So I guess it's still, I think they're equal in my opinion.
[03:06:35.060 --> 03:06:36.900]  I think there's benefits of both.
[03:06:36.900 --> 03:06:38.100]  There's a reason to run seeds
[03:06:38.100 --> 03:06:40.060]  and there's a benefit to run clones.
[03:06:40.060 --> 03:06:41.880]  And as a seed breeder,
[03:06:41.880 --> 03:06:44.140]  I should probably big up the seeds a little bit more.
[03:06:44.140 --> 03:06:45.640]  But to tell you the truth,
[03:06:45.640 --> 03:06:47.780]  all those famous cuts that you're getting,
[03:06:47.780 --> 03:06:50.020]  they're a famous cut for a reason.
[03:06:50.020 --> 03:06:52.420]  So we all have, everybody in this room grows the cookies.
[03:06:52.940 --> 03:06:55.700]  Everybody in this room has got a Gorilla Glue for a cut.
[03:06:55.700 --> 03:06:56.540]  So.
[03:06:56.540 --> 03:06:57.380]  No, not yet.
[03:06:57.380 --> 03:06:58.820]  Oh, you will by the end of the day then.
[03:06:58.820 --> 03:06:59.660]  Oh, word.
[03:06:59.660 --> 03:07:02.260]  Yeah, me neither too, man.
[03:07:02.260 --> 03:07:04.320]  Yeah, I could use another cut of that.
[03:07:04.320 --> 03:07:05.500]  Yeah.
[03:07:05.500 --> 03:07:07.500]  I saw your Instagram spins.
[03:07:07.500 --> 03:07:09.340]  Yeah, we all saw that beautiful Gorilla Glue.
[03:07:09.340 --> 03:07:10.180]  Who'd that come from?
[03:07:10.180 --> 03:07:11.500]  Do you want to give someone a shout out?
[03:07:11.500 --> 03:07:14.220]  Shout out to Mariano's Clones.
[03:07:14.220 --> 03:07:15.740]  That's his Instagram.
[03:07:15.740 --> 03:07:17.300]  He's out of Cali, Southern Cali.
[03:07:17.300 --> 03:07:19.140]  Not Southern Cali, like Central Cali.
[03:07:19.140 --> 03:07:20.220]  Central Cali, okay.
[03:07:22.420 --> 03:07:24.820]  Probably some of the best clones I've ever received
[03:07:24.820 --> 03:07:27.900]  as far as a month,
[03:07:27.900 --> 03:07:32.220]  or I got them like a month and four days ago or something.
[03:07:32.220 --> 03:07:34.940]  And they have literally blown the fuck up.
[03:07:34.940 --> 03:07:35.780]  I've seen pictures.
[03:07:35.780 --> 03:07:36.620]  They're healthy, they're happy.
[03:07:36.620 --> 03:07:39.220]  Check out at Garden of Weeden on Instagram.
[03:07:39.220 --> 03:07:41.700]  Garden of Weed, capital N at the end of it.
[03:07:41.700 --> 03:07:45.140]  It's all attached to the Garden of Weeden.
[03:07:45.140 --> 03:07:46.980]  There's websites, Facebook.
[03:07:47.980 --> 03:07:48.900]  Tumblr.
[03:07:50.420 --> 03:07:51.260]  That's it.
[03:07:51.260 --> 03:07:52.220]  Instagram.
[03:07:52.940 --> 03:07:53.780]  Yeah.
[03:07:53.780 --> 03:07:55.540]  We did not talk about auto flower plants.
[03:07:55.540 --> 03:07:57.060]  It's one thing I wanted to mention.
[03:07:57.060 --> 03:07:59.260]  That's okay, let's just get, whatever.
[03:07:59.260 --> 03:08:01.540]  That's kind of how I feel.
[03:08:01.540 --> 03:08:04.180]  Auto flower plants are, that's just, I will never breed.
[03:08:04.180 --> 03:08:06.380]  People always ask me if I will make an auto flower
[03:08:06.380 --> 03:08:07.620]  as a breeder, and I always say no.
[03:08:07.620 --> 03:08:10.820]  That's not for big boys.
[03:08:10.820 --> 03:08:12.300]  And then some people are going to hate me for saying that.
[03:08:12.300 --> 03:08:13.820]  If you need a fast production crop
[03:08:13.820 --> 03:08:16.500]  and you're not familiar with the cannabis plant,
[03:08:16.500 --> 03:08:17.540]  that may work for you,
[03:08:17.540 --> 03:08:20.580]  but it's not connoisseur grade herb in my opinion.
[03:08:20.580 --> 03:08:24.780]  Jesse and I are familiar with one epic freaking use
[03:08:24.780 --> 03:08:27.220]  of auto flower plants to discredit
[03:08:27.220 --> 03:08:28.620]  all the shit I just talked.
[03:08:30.180 --> 03:08:33.220]  We live in a community that is about 40 minutes away
[03:08:33.220 --> 03:08:35.420]  from a national forest, maybe an hour,
[03:08:35.420 --> 03:08:37.860]  depending on which routes you take.
[03:08:37.860 --> 03:08:42.540]  There was a legendary fucking bust of,
[03:08:42.540 --> 03:08:45.740]  there was a Mexican cartel in the national forest
[03:08:45.740 --> 03:08:49.860]  running a giant grow operation all year long
[03:08:50.780 --> 03:08:52.980]  very covertly in like a valley
[03:08:52.980 --> 03:08:55.060]  that they were hiking in and hiking out.
[03:08:55.060 --> 03:08:55.900]  They were camped there.
[03:08:55.900 --> 03:08:57.340]  They found food there and said these guys
[03:08:57.340 --> 03:08:58.740]  had been camped for a month.
[03:08:58.740 --> 03:09:00.340]  Very, very covertly.
[03:09:00.340 --> 03:09:01.220]  Yeah.
[03:09:01.220 --> 03:09:02.620]  The people that own the land around there
[03:09:02.620 --> 03:09:03.940]  were oblivious to it.
[03:09:03.940 --> 03:09:06.300]  And they had irrigation systems set up
[03:09:06.300 --> 03:09:08.060]  coming from the river, running downhill,
[03:09:08.060 --> 03:09:10.220]  watering all the plants.
[03:09:10.220 --> 03:09:11.060]  It was perfect.
[03:09:11.060 --> 03:09:12.340]  It was like a movie set up.
[03:09:13.700 --> 03:09:17.380]  I can, I mean, they had three different places.
[03:09:17.380 --> 03:09:18.300]  Did you go out there?
[03:09:18.300 --> 03:09:19.780]  Yeah, it was, I mean.
[03:09:19.780 --> 03:09:20.620]  It's hikable.
[03:09:20.620 --> 03:09:21.900]  It's area where we can hike to.
[03:09:21.900 --> 03:09:22.780]  Jess went out there and hiked.
[03:09:22.780 --> 03:09:23.780]  So we'll let him tell you about it.
[03:09:23.780 --> 03:09:28.780]  I mean, they clear cut a good seven acres
[03:09:28.940 --> 03:09:32.540]  of just prime national forest.
[03:09:32.540 --> 03:09:37.140]  Trees, full-size trees, just cut them down, clear cut them.
[03:09:37.140 --> 03:09:41.820]  No thought to drainage or no respect
[03:09:41.820 --> 03:09:45.540]  for the environment whatsoever to be the hippie.
[03:09:45.540 --> 03:09:47.580]  Yeah, well, I was told it was a mess out there.
[03:09:47.580 --> 03:09:51.460]  I knew one of the, not to blow too many fucking whistles,
[03:09:51.460 --> 03:09:55.020]  but I know a friend of mine's father is a retired cop
[03:09:55.020 --> 03:09:56.380]  and he's cool as shit.
[03:09:56.380 --> 03:09:59.060]  My buddy's a dab head and dabs sitting on the couch
[03:09:59.060 --> 03:10:01.220]  next to his dad, who was a cop at the time.
[03:10:02.100 --> 03:10:03.820]  He was telling us that there were plants out there
[03:10:03.820 --> 03:10:07.620]  of all stages, eight inches tall, 12 inches tall,
[03:10:07.620 --> 03:10:08.540]  three feet tall.
[03:10:08.540 --> 03:10:10.660]  And he said there were bags of buds
[03:10:10.660 --> 03:10:12.420]  and a manicuring station.
[03:10:12.420 --> 03:10:14.140]  And I was tripping out because when this place
[03:10:14.180 --> 03:10:17.540]  was discovered was not flowering season.
[03:10:17.540 --> 03:10:20.060]  It was like spring or some shit.
[03:10:20.060 --> 03:10:21.860]  And he was saying that they already had plants
[03:10:21.860 --> 03:10:24.300]  six foot tall, three foot tall with big buds on them
[03:10:24.300 --> 03:10:25.340]  in flower.
[03:10:25.340 --> 03:10:26.820]  And there's no way that they could have set up
[03:10:26.820 --> 03:10:29.940]  like a light depth out there on seven acres.
[03:10:29.940 --> 03:10:32.180]  I mean, without being busted.
[03:10:32.180 --> 03:10:34.140]  They were using auto flower plants,
[03:10:34.140 --> 03:10:37.220]  which that's the best use of auto flowers I could ever see.
[03:10:37.220 --> 03:10:39.060]  So if you're trying to do some crazy outdoor
[03:10:39.060 --> 03:10:41.860]  where you've got enough time before the cold,
[03:10:41.860 --> 03:10:43.700]  right after the cold, get those in the ground,
[03:10:44.260 --> 03:10:45.860]  you might be able to pull off an outdoor crop.
[03:10:45.860 --> 03:10:46.700]  Probably so.
[03:10:47.860 --> 03:10:49.580]  I mean, they were living up there.
[03:10:49.580 --> 03:10:53.980]  They had quite a little city and I may or may have found
[03:10:53.980 --> 03:10:57.620]  a plant and may have moved it down just to see
[03:10:57.620 --> 03:10:58.460]  what happened.
[03:10:58.460 --> 03:11:00.780]  And yeah, it was totally an auto flower.
[03:11:00.780 --> 03:11:03.860]  Could there have been any seeds up there by chance?
[03:11:03.860 --> 03:11:05.060]  Probably so.
[03:11:05.060 --> 03:11:08.140]  The plant I found was actually a male auto flowering plant.
[03:11:09.100 --> 03:11:12.340]  Yeah, I killed it, burned it, stomped it into the ground.
[03:11:14.300 --> 03:11:16.060]  Yeah, fuck a male auto flower plant.
[03:11:16.060 --> 03:11:18.340]  Yeah, that's super, super dangerous.
[03:11:19.380 --> 03:11:20.740]  Yeah.
[03:11:20.740 --> 03:11:23.220]  This is just gonna bust in your room one day.
[03:11:23.220 --> 03:11:25.420]  Spencer's eyeballs are about to pop out of his head.
[03:11:25.420 --> 03:11:26.260]  Yeah.
[03:11:26.260 --> 03:11:28.100]  How do you feel when you find a male in the grow room
[03:11:28.100 --> 03:11:29.780]  about three weeks into flower?
[03:11:32.700 --> 03:11:34.100]  It's only happened like once.
[03:11:34.100 --> 03:11:39.060]  And I don't know, it's probably one of the sad,
[03:11:39.060 --> 03:11:40.740]  not saddest days, but.
[03:11:40.740 --> 03:11:43.060]  I can compare it to the feeling of when a condom breaks.
[03:11:43.420 --> 03:11:46.220]  Yeah, it's like you walk in the room and you,
[03:11:46.220 --> 03:11:48.780]  because you can tell once it's like that far in,
[03:11:48.780 --> 03:11:50.940]  if you can't tell something's wrong,
[03:11:52.660 --> 03:11:54.980]  it's just kind of heartbreaking.
[03:11:54.980 --> 03:11:56.580]  Because at that point you don't know,
[03:11:56.580 --> 03:11:58.980]  like you don't know what it hit, if it hit,
[03:11:58.980 --> 03:12:01.220]  if it's dropping pollen, is it not dropping pollen?
[03:12:01.220 --> 03:12:03.780]  There's just too many questions going on.
[03:12:03.780 --> 03:12:06.180]  And then when you find some seeds in your nugs,
[03:12:07.180 --> 03:12:08.780]  a month and a half or three months later,
[03:12:08.780 --> 03:12:11.020]  it's like, well, damn, there it goes.
[03:12:11.020 --> 03:12:11.980]  There's the results.
[03:12:12.580 --> 03:12:13.820]  Saw it go, oops.
[03:12:13.820 --> 03:12:14.980]  So guys pay attention with the males,
[03:12:14.980 --> 03:12:16.660]  that room, that plant in the back.
[03:12:16.660 --> 03:12:19.780]  Yeah, if you see a yellow dust on your leaf,
[03:12:22.020 --> 03:12:24.660]  I discovered a male one time by that.
[03:12:24.660 --> 03:12:25.660]  Oops.
[03:12:25.660 --> 03:12:27.260]  Look at that, what, oh shit.
[03:12:28.620 --> 03:12:30.500]  Those nanners just erupted.
[03:12:30.500 --> 03:12:31.540]  Yeah, be careful.
[03:12:31.540 --> 03:12:32.900]  Keep an eye on your feminize seeds too,
[03:12:32.900 --> 03:12:36.620]  because fem seeds can turn into hermaphrodites or males.
[03:12:37.780 --> 03:12:39.100]  I hope we actually covered something.
[03:12:39.100 --> 03:12:41.700]  We got dabbed as shit on this episode talking about this.
[03:12:42.380 --> 03:12:43.300]  So I hope we made some sort of sense.
[03:12:43.300 --> 03:12:45.140]  I want to stress my point again.
[03:12:45.140 --> 03:12:46.780]  Growing from seeds is awesome.
[03:12:46.780 --> 03:12:47.940]  Everything came from seed.
[03:12:47.940 --> 03:12:52.060]  Yeah, that's, if you grow for the curiosity
[03:12:52.060 --> 03:12:53.460]  and just the love of the plant,
[03:12:53.460 --> 03:12:55.340]  and you've never grown from seed,
[03:12:55.340 --> 03:12:57.900]  well, I question your curiosity then.
[03:12:57.900 --> 03:13:00.300]  Well, if you grow from seed,
[03:13:00.300 --> 03:13:02.780]  I grow from seed because there's a possibility
[03:13:02.780 --> 03:13:04.860]  of finding something that people don't have.
[03:13:04.860 --> 03:13:08.140]  And that's my answer for you right there.
[03:13:08.140 --> 03:13:08.980]  Yeah.
[03:13:08.980 --> 03:13:10.420]  I would literally, I'll grow a pack of seeds
[03:13:10.460 --> 03:13:15.020]  to find a pheno that maybe two people out of,
[03:13:15.020 --> 03:13:17.380]  what, a couple hundred people that have bought in packs
[03:13:17.380 --> 03:13:19.980]  have, who knows, one day that strain
[03:13:19.980 --> 03:13:22.260]  could be everything you want it to.
[03:13:22.260 --> 03:13:24.820]  And I've seen seeds, I forget the term for it,
[03:13:24.820 --> 03:13:27.380]  but I have bred seeds that the outcome
[03:13:27.380 --> 03:13:30.260]  has been better than both parents.
[03:13:30.260 --> 03:13:33.060]  Like it got more vigor and more trichomes
[03:13:33.060 --> 03:13:36.460]  than the two parents I used and I upgraded.
[03:13:36.460 --> 03:13:39.420]  So that's a good way to look at it.
[03:13:39.420 --> 03:13:41.100]  You got something in your brain there.
[03:13:41.100 --> 03:13:42.140]  I know that term.
[03:13:42.140 --> 03:13:42.980]  Yeah.
[03:13:42.980 --> 03:13:43.820]  I can't.
[03:13:43.820 --> 03:13:45.100]  I think DJ Shortmite had recently said it.
[03:13:45.100 --> 03:13:45.940]  Yeah.
[03:13:45.940 --> 03:13:46.780]  Yeah, somebody said it.
[03:13:46.780 --> 03:13:47.620]  Yeah.
[03:13:47.620 --> 03:13:49.540]  I actually looked it up when he said it.
[03:13:49.540 --> 03:13:51.220]  Somebody tweeted to us at agro culture.
[03:13:51.220 --> 03:13:53.460]  I'll send you a two IRI genetic stickers.
[03:13:55.020 --> 03:13:55.860]  I really will.
[03:13:55.860 --> 03:13:57.220]  I really, really will.
[03:13:57.220 --> 03:13:59.420]  Maybe something cooler if I can find something to send you.
[03:13:59.420 --> 03:14:01.380]  It will not be seeds or anything, I promise.
[03:14:01.380 --> 03:14:02.500]  I won't ship seeds.
[03:14:02.500 --> 03:14:03.580]  Don't do that.
[03:14:03.580 --> 03:14:04.900]  Hey guys, stop shipping shit.
[03:14:04.900 --> 03:14:06.900]  A friend of ours got in trouble for shipping shit.
[03:14:06.900 --> 03:14:08.340]  I was calling a friend.
[03:14:08.340 --> 03:14:09.180]  Yeah.
[03:14:09.940 --> 03:14:11.900]  This person in the community
[03:14:11.900 --> 03:14:14.020]  that is not anymore in the community
[03:14:14.020 --> 03:14:15.300]  got fucking busted shipping shit
[03:14:15.300 --> 03:14:16.180]  and it makes us all look bad.
[03:14:16.180 --> 03:14:17.420]  It makes Colorado look stupid.
[03:14:17.420 --> 03:14:18.980]  It makes you look stupid.
[03:14:18.980 --> 03:14:20.060]  Stop shipping shit, please.
[03:14:20.060 --> 03:14:21.900]  If you want some shit, come get it.
[03:14:21.900 --> 03:14:23.620]  It's legal in Colorado for 21.
[03:14:24.500 --> 03:14:25.740]  The dispensary has what you want.
[03:14:25.740 --> 03:14:27.700]  We don't have to mail it to you.
[03:14:27.700 --> 03:14:29.660]  Sorry to bust up anybody's business ring
[03:14:29.660 --> 03:14:30.820]  for making some money shipping shit,
[03:14:30.820 --> 03:14:32.420]  but there are plenty of sick people here.
[03:14:32.420 --> 03:14:33.900]  There are plenty of recreational people here.
[03:14:33.900 --> 03:14:36.620]  We fought to get this shit right here.
[03:14:36.620 --> 03:14:37.460]  It's legit here.
[03:14:37.460 --> 03:14:38.380]  Stop shipping shit.
[03:14:39.700 --> 03:14:40.780]  Everyone's nodding their heads.
[03:14:40.780 --> 03:14:41.900]  Yeah.
[03:14:41.900 --> 03:14:43.620]  Fuck middlemen anyways.
[03:14:43.620 --> 03:14:44.860]  Yeah, grow your own.
[03:14:44.860 --> 03:14:45.940]  Go straight to the grower.
[03:14:45.940 --> 03:14:46.780]  Grow your own.
[03:14:46.780 --> 03:14:47.620]  If you're listening to this podcast,
[03:14:47.620 --> 03:14:48.660]  you're probably not one of the people
[03:14:48.660 --> 03:14:49.540]  that ship and shit anyway,
[03:14:49.540 --> 03:14:50.420]  so I don't even need to bitch at you.
[03:14:50.420 --> 03:14:51.500]  You're growing your own herb.
[03:14:51.500 --> 03:14:52.980]  You got some quality dabs.
[03:14:52.980 --> 03:14:54.380]  You're hanging out with us.
[03:14:55.380 --> 03:14:56.740]  You guys got anything you want to bullshit about?
[03:14:56.740 --> 03:14:57.580]  I like having you on.
[03:14:57.580 --> 03:14:59.540]  We don't need to cut off a conversation here
[03:14:59.540 --> 03:15:00.500]  just because I'm out of material
[03:15:00.500 --> 03:15:01.900]  to talk about on the seed stuff.
[03:15:01.900 --> 03:15:03.740]  You got anything fun to add?
[03:15:03.740 --> 03:15:06.100]  There was a news story in the news.
[03:15:09.700 --> 03:15:10.900]  Shit, I can't remember.
[03:15:12.500 --> 03:15:13.500]  Huh, Jesse's high.
[03:15:13.500 --> 03:15:14.340]  Do you remember where he saw it?
[03:15:14.340 --> 03:15:15.180]  I'll go Google.
[03:15:15.180 --> 03:15:16.060]  I'll hit the cannabis right quick.
[03:15:16.060 --> 03:15:17.980]  All the weed news hits the cannabis.
[03:15:17.980 --> 03:15:18.900]  What was it about?
[03:15:19.820 --> 03:15:20.660]  I can't even remember.
[03:15:20.660 --> 03:15:21.500]  I think it was comical.
[03:15:21.500 --> 03:15:22.340]  That's what I'm trying to remember.
[03:15:22.340 --> 03:15:23.180]  Comical?
[03:15:23.180 --> 03:15:24.260]  Yeah.
[03:15:24.260 --> 03:15:26.060]  I want to say like I may have seen it
[03:15:26.060 --> 03:15:27.540]  in the post or something.
[03:15:27.540 --> 03:15:29.300]  I am not sponsored by the cannabis or anything.
[03:15:29.300 --> 03:15:31.420]  A lot of people disagree with what the cannabis says.
[03:15:31.420 --> 03:15:32.620]  Sometimes they print some articles
[03:15:32.620 --> 03:15:34.380]  that I will agree are fucking wacky.
[03:15:34.380 --> 03:15:35.220]  Yeah.
[03:15:35.220 --> 03:15:36.060]  Right as I opened the cannabis,
[03:15:36.060 --> 03:15:36.900]  there's an article that says,
[03:15:36.900 --> 03:15:39.100]  cannabis Q and A, grow room tour,
[03:15:39.100 --> 03:15:41.180]  and other reader questions.
[03:15:41.180 --> 03:15:42.220]  Check out that grow room tour.
[03:15:42.220 --> 03:15:43.060]  I want to read that.
[03:15:43.060 --> 03:15:43.900]  I haven't read it yet,
[03:15:43.900 --> 03:15:44.740]  but that'll be neat.
[03:15:44.740 --> 03:15:45.900]  Any grow room tour is fun.
[03:15:45.900 --> 03:15:47.420]  You might learn something there.
[03:15:47.420 --> 03:15:48.940]  Ask me if you have questions about that.
[03:15:48.940 --> 03:15:51.000]  The three of us in this room,
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:52.460]  we could design and build you
[03:15:52.460 --> 03:15:53.860]  the most fucking amazing grow room
[03:15:53.860 --> 03:15:55.140]  the three of us got together.
[03:15:55.140 --> 03:15:58.060]  God, somebody let me build one.
[03:15:58.060 --> 03:15:59.780]  Yeah, let the three of us build it.
[03:15:59.780 --> 03:16:01.140]  We'll crush it.
[03:16:01.140 --> 03:16:04.620]  It'll be the Lamborghini of a grow room.
[03:16:04.620 --> 03:16:08.380]  Bro, I don't see much on the cannabis
[03:16:08.380 --> 03:16:10.100]  worth reading on the show.
[03:16:10.100 --> 03:16:11.180]  Yeah.
[03:16:11.180 --> 03:16:12.100]  All right.
[03:16:12.100 --> 03:16:12.940]  Next time.
[03:16:12.940 --> 03:16:14.660]  Next time we'll have some news for you.
[03:16:14.660 --> 03:16:16.140]  I'll find something to read.
[03:16:17.020 --> 03:16:17.940]  You guys got anything cool to add?
[03:16:17.940 --> 03:16:20.460]  Shout out to everybody over at the Garden of Weeden.
[03:16:20.460 --> 03:16:21.420]  While Spence is away,
[03:16:21.420 --> 03:16:22.740]  I hope they're all behaving themselves
[03:16:22.740 --> 03:16:24.260]  and having a good time.
[03:16:24.260 --> 03:16:28.180]  Big Mike, Maddie, Slop, Nani's.
[03:16:28.180 --> 03:16:29.020]  Surrock boy.
[03:16:29.020 --> 03:16:29.860]  Surrock boy.
[03:16:29.860 --> 03:16:30.700]  Surrock boy.
[03:16:30.700 --> 03:16:31.540]  Boy, what's up boy?
[03:16:31.540 --> 03:16:32.380]  Earl.
[03:16:32.380 --> 03:16:33.200]  Earl.
[03:16:33.200 --> 03:16:34.040]  Earl.
[03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:35.240]  Indica.
[03:16:35.240 --> 03:16:36.640]  Damn, I got a house full.
[03:16:36.640 --> 03:16:38.120]  Ping pong, Sloppy.
[03:16:38.120 --> 03:16:39.960]  Yeah, ping pong's not here, but shout out to him.
[03:16:39.960 --> 03:16:41.000]  Big shout out to ping pong.
[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:41.960]  We love you always, bro.
[03:16:41.960 --> 03:16:43.200]  We miss you.
[03:16:43.200 --> 03:16:44.360]  Had to ship out.
[03:16:44.360 --> 03:16:47.120]  Had to ship out so he could shape up.
[03:16:47.120 --> 03:16:48.360]  What are Slop's little pups names?
[03:16:48.360 --> 03:16:49.200]  Those are cute as fuck.
[03:16:49.200 --> 03:16:50.120]  I always forget.
[03:16:50.120 --> 03:16:50.960]  Bane and-
[03:16:50.960 --> 03:16:51.880]  Bane and Harvey.
[03:16:51.880 --> 03:16:53.680]  Harvey's the one I forget his name all the time.
[03:16:53.680 --> 03:16:55.040]  Those dogs are cute as shit.
[03:16:55.040 --> 03:16:55.880]  Yeah.
[03:16:55.880 --> 03:16:57.600]  Good work on those two little pups, bro.
[03:16:57.600 --> 03:16:58.440]  For sure.
[03:16:58.440 --> 03:16:59.280]  All right.
[03:16:59.280 --> 03:17:00.120]  It doesn't sound like we got a lot.
[03:17:00.120 --> 03:17:00.960]  Uh oh.
[03:17:00.960 --> 03:17:01.800]  You got something to say?
[03:17:01.800 --> 03:17:03.800]  Izzy and Pork Chop.
[03:17:04.560 --> 03:17:05.400]  Oh shit, Izzy.
[03:17:05.400 --> 03:17:06.240]  I missed Izzy.
[03:17:06.240 --> 03:17:07.060]  I'm sorry.
[03:17:07.060 --> 03:17:07.900]  I'm not very familiar with that one.
[03:17:07.900 --> 03:17:10.720]  Can we, can you pause recording real quick?
[03:17:10.720 --> 03:17:13.120]  I want to ask Spencer a question.
[03:17:13.120 --> 03:17:13.960]  Yeah.
[03:17:13.960 --> 03:17:15.120]  Possibly have a story to tell.
[03:17:15.120 --> 03:17:15.960]  That's cool.
[03:17:15.960 --> 03:17:17.280]  I'll hit pause right here.
[03:17:17.280 --> 03:17:18.120]  Hold on guys.
[03:17:18.120 --> 03:17:18.940]  We're going to hit pause and make sure
[03:17:18.940 --> 03:17:20.760]  that what we can talk about is talk aboutable on a show.
[03:17:20.760 --> 03:17:21.680]  Hold on.
[03:17:21.680 --> 03:17:23.160]  Actually, I'll just turn the mics down and the music up
[03:17:23.160 --> 03:17:24.920]  and you guys get down for half a second.
[03:17:32.290 --> 03:17:33.410]  All right, we're recording now.
[03:17:33.410 --> 03:17:34.250]  We're coming back.
[03:17:34.250 --> 03:17:35.090]  I am back.
[03:17:35.090 --> 03:17:35.930]  Yeah, we're back.
[03:17:35.930 --> 03:17:36.770]  Yo.
[03:17:37.170 --> 03:17:39.170]  That story was not appropriate for listeners.
[03:17:39.170 --> 03:17:40.570]  No, no.
[03:17:40.570 --> 03:17:42.010]  You missed a fucking hell of a story.
[03:17:42.010 --> 03:17:42.850]  I apologize.
[03:17:42.850 --> 03:17:44.250]  We can't air that.
[03:17:44.250 --> 03:17:45.170]  That's somebody's personal shit.
[03:17:45.170 --> 03:17:47.170]  Are there any events coming up?
[03:17:47.170 --> 03:17:49.410]  I think the Secret Cup's coming up, right?
[03:17:49.410 --> 03:17:50.250]  Yep.
[03:17:50.250 --> 03:17:51.850]  The Secret Cup.
[03:17:51.850 --> 03:17:55.170]  The regional is 30th and 31st
[03:17:55.170 --> 03:17:57.490]  are the open vendor days where you can come
[03:17:57.490 --> 03:18:00.610]  and check it out, I guess.
[03:18:00.610 --> 03:18:03.650]  I think I've got my VIP spot set up.
[03:18:03.650 --> 03:18:04.830]  Yeah, I'll be there.
[03:18:04.990 --> 03:18:07.510]  Um, there'll be a bunch of people.
[03:18:07.510 --> 03:18:08.350]  It'll be fun.
[03:18:08.350 --> 03:18:10.510]  Oh, everybody in the industry that is in Colorado
[03:18:10.510 --> 03:18:11.870]  will show up.
[03:18:11.870 --> 03:18:13.230]  Shout out to Big D for putting that on.
[03:18:13.230 --> 03:18:14.950]  We do a lot of shout outs on this show.
[03:18:14.950 --> 03:18:15.790]  Is this gonna be in-
[03:18:15.790 --> 03:18:16.750]  We give a lot of love.
[03:18:16.750 --> 03:18:18.190]  It's in the mountains, is it not?
[03:18:18.190 --> 03:18:19.190]  It's in Denver now.
[03:18:19.190 --> 03:18:20.030]  Oh, okay.
[03:18:20.030 --> 03:18:22.390]  Or it's in an undisclosed location.
[03:18:22.390 --> 03:18:24.310]  Yeah, necessarily.
[03:18:24.310 --> 03:18:25.870]  Yeah.
[03:18:25.870 --> 03:18:27.950]  A lot of us were too, we're all prima donnas
[03:18:27.950 --> 03:18:30.870]  and didn't wanna go dab in the fucking woods
[03:18:30.870 --> 03:18:33.390]  because it's just hard to plug in your email out there.
[03:18:33.390 --> 03:18:35.390]  I like to take showers.
[03:18:35.390 --> 03:18:38.110]  I'm not trying to like, stank for three days.
[03:18:38.110 --> 03:18:41.190]  We went camping and had an email with us.
[03:18:41.190 --> 03:18:42.950]  I owe a big shout out to Turpex
[03:18:42.950 --> 03:18:45.230]  and Hunt from the Grimy Gatsby.
[03:18:45.230 --> 03:18:47.670]  Turpy Slurpy boys, Turpy Slurpy.
[03:18:47.670 --> 03:18:48.630]  Turpy Slurpy.
[03:18:48.630 --> 03:18:50.150]  Turpy Slurpy, they know what's up, bro.
[03:18:50.150 --> 03:18:51.430]  That's some code word right there.
[03:18:51.430 --> 03:18:53.190]  That's a code word for something.
[03:18:53.190 --> 03:18:54.310]  Turpy Slurpy.
[03:18:55.470 --> 03:18:56.590]  What you know about that shit?
[03:18:56.590 --> 03:18:58.310]  Exactly, see, Turpy Slurpy.
[03:18:58.310 --> 03:19:00.310]  Man, this dome is stuck on this rig like a bitch.
[03:19:00.310 --> 03:19:02.830]  We're gonna have to do a dab on this other rig here.
[03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:04.230]  Hey guys, I appreciate you listening to us
[03:19:04.230 --> 03:19:05.310]  just ramble for a couple of minutes.
[03:19:05.310 --> 03:19:06.470]  It doesn't sound like we got much left
[03:19:06.470 --> 03:19:08.870]  on this little chatty part of the show.
[03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:11.670]  I wanna thank these guys for showing up once again.
[03:19:11.670 --> 03:19:13.190]  People really like having you guys on the show.
[03:19:13.190 --> 03:19:14.790]  I get a lot of listens when you guys show up,
[03:19:14.790 --> 03:19:16.910]  when you shout me out on your social media.
[03:19:16.910 --> 03:19:18.230]  So thanks for doing that.
[03:19:19.350 --> 03:19:20.630]  You guys got anybody you wanna shout out
[03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:22.530]  before we wrap this little section up?
[03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:25.830]  They went silent.
[03:19:25.830 --> 03:19:27.790]  How about to shout out to Hanky B.
[03:19:27.790 --> 03:19:29.030]  Yeah, shout out to Hanky B.
[03:19:29.030 --> 03:19:31.230]  We all owe a shout out to Hanky B, the homie,

[03:19:33.150 --> 03:19:35.710]  OG, but he's young OG.
[03:19:35.710 --> 03:19:36.550]  Young OG.
[03:19:36.550 --> 03:19:38.070]  Yeah, whatever.
[03:19:38.070 --> 03:19:39.990]  Showing that age does not fucking matter.
[03:19:39.990 --> 03:19:40.990]  No.
[03:19:40.990 --> 03:19:41.830]  Yeah.
[03:19:41.830 --> 03:19:42.650]  Hustle harder.
[03:19:42.650 --> 03:19:43.910]  Hustle every day.
[03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:45.150]  All right guys, we're gonna take a couple
[03:19:45.150 --> 03:19:47.510]  of Jerry Garcia sized dabs here.
[03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:48.390]  Thanks for listening to us.
[03:19:48.390 --> 03:19:49.230]  If you have any questions,
[03:19:49.230 --> 03:19:51.430]  because I know we kind of went over that quickly.
[03:19:51.430 --> 03:19:53.390]  We're all dabbed out and we all have ADD here
[03:19:53.390 --> 03:19:55.470]  and we just wanted to hang out with each other a little bit.
[03:19:55.470 --> 03:19:57.270]  So if you have any questions, you know how to do it.
[03:19:57.270 --> 03:19:58.950]  Email me, tweet me, I'll say all that stuff.
[03:19:58.950 --> 03:20:00.270]  I'm gonna be back in just a couple of minutes
[03:20:00.270 --> 03:20:01.110]  to wrap up the show.
[03:20:01.930 --> 03:20:02.770]  Enjoy a little bit of music here
[03:20:02.770 --> 03:20:03.950]  and we're gonna get down.
[03:20:04.870 --> 03:20:07.190]  I'll leave the mics on so you can hear his dab for a minute.
