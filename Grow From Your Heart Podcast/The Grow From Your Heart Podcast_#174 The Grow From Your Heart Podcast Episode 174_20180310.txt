[00:01.150 --> 00:21.840]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community. It's time for episode number 174 of the Grow From
[00:21.840 --> 00:25.960]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:25.960 --> 00:30.000]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.360]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious
[00:34.360 --> 00:39.520]  about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:39.520 --> 00:43.120]  host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As
[00:43.120 --> 00:46.760]  always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.760 --> 00:51.800]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic
[00:51.800 --> 00:59.100]  Roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen, I am coming to you on a frosty, cold Colorado evening.
[00:59.100 --> 01:03.520]  It's about seven degrees outside. There's about a foot of snow out there. It is miserable.
[01:03.520 --> 01:07.220]  I am glad to be in here recording a podcast with you guys, but you know what? I'm nice
[01:07.220 --> 01:11.560]  and warm because I am wearing my official Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodie made by

[02:08.200 --> 02:11.400]  Our friend Bobo Blastrico and Lindsey stopped by this afternoon. They came and had a little
[02:11.400 --> 02:16.520]  mini afternoon sesh with me today. While they were here, Bobo mentioned that he was just
[02:16.520 --> 02:20.840]  wearing that hoodie, and he did not have on a heavy jacket or anything. He said he was
[02:20.840 --> 02:25.560]  nice and warm and cozy. Ladies and gentlemen, it was fucking cold and nasty out there today.
[02:25.560 --> 02:29.360]  Those hoodies are super cozy. These hoodies are nice and warm. I feel all snuggly in it,
[02:29.360 --> 02:33.760]  and it looks great on me. It can look great on you also. Send me an email. That was hard
[02:33.760 --> 02:38.040]  to say. Growfromyourheartathotmail.com. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to
[02:38.040 --> 02:42.160]  get through that ad, and then I'm going to shift directions here. I've got some terrible
[02:42.160 --> 02:46.080]  news. I'm going to turn on the music for this part. I want to have just a very ... It's
[02:46.080 --> 02:49.360]  a podcast, so I can't do too long of a moment of silence, but I'm going to take a very brief
[02:49.360 --> 02:54.440]  moment of silence for a very important member of the cannabis community that we have lost.
[02:54.440 --> 02:59.760]  There is a seed company known as the Greenhouse Seed Company. They were one of the very first
[02:59.760 --> 03:06.640]  and largest seed companies and coffee shops in Amsterdam. Greenhouse Seed Company is founded
[03:06.640 --> 03:12.000]  and mostly led by a man by the name of Arjen Roskam, who was a great man. He's a cannabis
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.800]  breeder. He is a chef. He's a traveler. Arjen's partner in crime, his best friend, his cohort,
[03:18.800 --> 03:25.120]  his cannabis compadre was a young man by the name of Franco. Unfortunately, I hate to report
[03:25.120 --> 03:34.400]  that Franco unfortunately passed away. Franco contracted malaria while in the Congo. Franco
[03:34.400 --> 03:42.320]  was in the Congo, in the jungle of the Congo, trying to do research and get CBD to people
[03:42.320 --> 03:48.480]  who have contracted malaria. He was there trying to get CBD medicine to folks who contracted
[03:48.480 --> 03:54.280]  malaria and he got cerebral malaria himself, and he passed from the malaria. I'm going
[03:54.280 --> 04:02.820]  to take a very brief moment of silence here. This blink of silence is for Franco. All right.
[04:02.820 --> 04:07.220]  Much respect to Franco. Franco was a strain hunter. Franco was a ganja farmer. Franco
[04:07.220 --> 04:14.260]  was a wonderful man. He was a great dude. He had great energy. If you go to, I think
[04:14.260 --> 04:17.900]  it's just Franco Strain Hunter on Instagram. If you look at all of his pictures, he always
[04:17.900 --> 04:23.140]  has a smile. He's always hugging somebody or a cannabis plant in every single one of
[04:23.140 --> 04:27.620]  his pictures. Franco loved strain hunting. Franco loved traveling the world in search
[04:27.620 --> 04:32.820]  of the best cannabis. You can find a lot of video footage of Franco on the Strain Hunter
[04:32.820 --> 04:37.660]  video series from Greenhouse Seeds. When you watch those videos, you will see Franco's
[04:37.660 --> 04:42.960]  passion for cannabis and you will see the friendship between Simon and Franco and Arjan.
[04:42.960 --> 04:47.920]  It's a magical friendship and it is a huge loss to the cannabis community to lose a man
[04:47.920 --> 04:52.180]  like Franco. One thing that I can do to make myself feel better, and maybe this will make
[04:52.220 --> 04:58.100]  you feel better too, is we lost a whole bunch of notable musicians, actors, comedians, and
[04:58.100 --> 05:02.980]  notable folks in the past few years. Now, wherever those people have congregated, wherever
[05:02.980 --> 05:07.900]  you believe people go when they pass, now they've got a quality ganja farmer growing
[05:07.900 --> 05:12.060]  ganja for them. When you and I get to the great gig in the sky, Franco will be there
[05:12.060 --> 05:17.020]  with a fat one rolled waiting for us and a big old hug. He'll be there to greet you.
[05:17.020 --> 05:21.900]  Big shout out to Franco. A big hug and much respect to the entire Greenhouse Seeds family
[05:21.940 --> 05:26.180]  and also big hug to everybody who was touched by Franco and has a tear in their eye because
[05:26.180 --> 05:27.180]  of this news.
[05:27.180 --> 05:32.700]  All right, you guys, I'm going to try to shift gears and we're going to do a product review.
[05:32.700 --> 05:35.980]  I quite often ask if people would like to have a product reviewed. All they need to
[05:35.980 --> 05:40.620]  do is send me an email. It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com and I can teach you how to get your product
[05:40.620 --> 05:45.420]  in my hands and I will review it here on the show for you. My latest product I have got
[05:45.420 --> 05:50.740]  for review today is a grinder. This was sent to me by Chop Shop Grinders. Big shout out
[05:50.740 --> 05:56.940]  to Chop Shop Grinders. This is a nice grinder. It's got a nice black shine to it. It's got
[05:56.940 --> 06:03.100]  the Chop Shop Grinders logo on the top. It is very similar to most grinders. It has got
[06:03.100 --> 06:07.740]  a top piece that you lift open. You put your flour product in here. You put the lid back
[06:07.740 --> 06:11.740]  on. You give it a good spin. Then it's got a part you unscrew. I'm unscrewing it as I
[06:11.740 --> 06:16.580]  do it. There's a nice mesh screen in here. This is where your ground flour ends up. It
[06:16.580 --> 06:22.540]  says to grind it coarse, to leave it one direction, for a fine grind, to flip it upside
[06:22.540 --> 06:28.380]  down and grind it that way for a finer grind. Then of course it's got this little screen
[06:28.380 --> 06:33.340]  here to where on the bottom you can actually catch the keef. If you're a keef catching
[06:33.340 --> 06:37.220]  kind of guy, you can put that in your bowls or you can put that on your joints or you
[06:37.220 --> 06:41.860]  can do whatever you want with your keef. There's a lot of uses for it. That kind of puts me
[06:41.860 --> 06:46.100]  on a side rant, you guys. This is called a pollen catch is what this portion of the grinder
[06:46.100 --> 06:52.380]  is but keef is not pollen. People that call keef pollen, you are wrong. Pollen comes from
[06:52.380 --> 06:59.360]  male plants. There is no pollen in your female plants unless something went horribly wrong.
[06:59.360 --> 07:04.060]  You are not catching pollen that is keef. Those are mainly trichomes that you are gathering
[07:04.060 --> 07:08.100]  in the bottom there. You can gather those up and put them on a bowl or you can put them
[07:08.100 --> 07:12.300]  in a joint or if you're going to wrap a little bit of wax around a joint, you can also put
[07:12.300 --> 07:17.980]  that keef on the outside of the wax. It is very potent. That's basically trichomes that
[07:17.980 --> 07:22.860]  have fallen off of your buds but it is not pollen so please quit calling that pollen.
[07:22.860 --> 07:26.420]  All right, let's get back to this grinder. One thing I do like about this grinder is
[07:26.420 --> 07:30.620]  it is super light. I've got another grinder that I carry in my backpack. It is really
[07:30.620 --> 07:35.980]  heavy. This one has replaced the backpack grinder. It's got these really... One thing
[07:35.980 --> 07:40.340]  I complain about grinders is they get stuck a lot. Once you get some material in there,
[07:40.340 --> 07:45.060]  they start getting a little sticky. They don't want to turn. This one has little...
[07:45.060 --> 07:48.900]  I want to call them just finger indentions. They're just little grippies for your fingers
[07:48.900 --> 07:52.420]  to where it's not going to get stuck. I know that I will always be able to spin this grinder
[07:52.420 --> 07:57.100]  because of the little finger grippies on here. My sharpstone grinder, it got stuck. It's
[07:57.100 --> 08:01.140]  still stuck. Fuck it. I'm never going to get it undone. I'm not going to try. Now I've
[08:01.140 --> 08:07.100]  got a chop shop grinder to use and it will not get stuck. I can rely on this.
[08:07.100 --> 08:11.740]  I'm going to put a couple of flowers in here and we're going to smoke a joint together.
[08:11.740 --> 08:16.940]  Before I do that, I've already got one tiny complaint about this grinder. The only complaint
[08:16.940 --> 08:22.140]  I have is that it's too small. This thing is probably three inches in diameter. I've
[08:22.140 --> 08:25.940]  got two nuggets sitting here that I plan on rolling into one joint. I'm going to have
[08:25.940 --> 08:31.440]  to grind both of my buds separately because they will not fit in this grinder. That may
[08:31.440 --> 08:36.500]  not be everybody's problem. Everybody may not have giant buds or too much weed for their
[08:36.500 --> 08:41.780]  grinder. For a guy like myself, I'm going to have to run this grinder twice just to
[08:41.780 --> 08:45.860]  get these buds ground up. I'm semi-breaking up this first bud. There's a stem in the middle
[08:45.860 --> 08:51.340]  I'm taking out. This grinder, the top portion is pretty full. I'm putting the little lid
[08:51.340 --> 08:57.940]  on. I'm going to give it a grind into the mic so you can hear it. That's all it took.
[08:57.940 --> 09:02.000]  This weed is pretty much ground up, ready to roll into a joint. I'm going to give it
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.880]  a couple more twists. I'm going to take the top off. Now I'm just going to put the other
[09:04.880 --> 09:09.380]  nug in here. I've got to give it a little pre-break. What I'm grinding up is called
[09:09.380 --> 09:14.980]  Burning Spear. This is Girl Scout Cookies. The Forum Cut of Girl Scout Cookies pollinated
[09:14.980 --> 09:21.600]  by a reversed Grateful Dog. It's Forum Cookies to Grateful Dog. This was a Feminize seed
[09:21.600 --> 09:26.760]  that I grew. I did not put these seeds out to the market. I gave a few of them to Spence
[09:26.760 --> 09:31.480]  from the Garden of Weeden for his birthday one year. He's the only one that got seeds.
[09:31.480 --> 09:36.080]  I'm pretty sure he gifted a couple of those to another grower friend because I saw pictures
[09:36.080 --> 09:40.600]  of them. Spence and that one dude are the only people that really got seeds of this.
[09:40.600 --> 09:46.840]  It smells very Girl Scout Cookies-y, but once you start grinding it, it releases a Chem
[09:46.840 --> 09:54.360]  Dog fuel, funk, dirty feet sort of a thing. It's kind of like if you hid your bag of Girl
[09:54.360 --> 10:00.360]  Scout Cookies weed in a dirty sock in a good way. It's so funky. I like it. I've got it
[10:00.360 --> 10:07.280]  nice and ground up here in this chop shop grinder, which I like. The grind, the consistency
[10:07.280 --> 10:12.120]  and texture that it grounded is perfect for a nice joint. It's not too fine. It's not
[10:12.120 --> 10:16.600]  too coarse. I actually did it the normal way. It says for a coarser grind to flip it upside
[10:16.600 --> 10:21.760]  down. I did not do that. So now, let's see. I stuck two papers together because I like
[10:21.760 --> 10:25.000]  to roll fat joints and then I made myself a little tip here. So I'm going to put that
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.960]  in here. I'm going to dump the dope into here and give it a twist and a lick. And then
[10:30.960 --> 10:34.000]  we're going to smoke a joint together while we do a podcast. You guys, I'm going to lick
[10:34.000 --> 10:40.720]  it and twist it. You won't hear me rambling while I lick it. There's a twist. Oh, got
[10:40.720 --> 10:44.040]  to tuck that corner. The key to rolling a good joint is just getting that first corner
[10:44.040 --> 10:53.340]  tuck. There we go. I'm going to give it a lick right now. One thing I do, you guys might
[10:53.340 --> 10:57.540]  think I'm crazy. I lick the outside. I don't lick the gummed part because I feel like you
[10:57.540 --> 11:01.700]  just drag that gummed part around and you waste it. My joints tend to stick a lot better
[11:01.700 --> 11:05.980]  if I lick the outside and moisten that gum and don't lick it off with my tongue. All
[11:05.980 --> 11:10.780]  right, before I light this joint, I should conclude my grinder review. Chop Shop grinder
[11:10.780 --> 11:18.220]  review. It's a little bit small, but the small size is okay because of how light it is. This
[11:18.220 --> 11:23.820]  is a much better backpack grinder. It ground my weed perfectly fine. I like the little
[11:23.820 --> 11:27.780]  pollen catch that is actually a Keef catch on the bottom here. It came with a little
[11:27.780 --> 11:33.060]  scooper so that when I do have a nice collection, I can scoop it up. I'm going to say I approve
[11:33.060 --> 11:38.380]  of this grinder. This is a great grinder. If you're looking for a grinder, this one
[11:38.380 --> 11:42.100]  would make you happy. So shout out to Chop Shop grinders. Make sure you check them out
[11:42.100 --> 11:46.620]  on the interweb. All right, I've got a joint rolled up, so I'm going to light this joint
[11:46.620 --> 11:49.540]  and we're going to smoke a joint together. Hopefully you guys are rolling something.
[11:49.540 --> 11:53.580]  Hopefully you guys twisted up a fat joint. Send me a tweet and let me know what you're
[11:53.580 --> 12:00.220]  smoking with me. Send the tweet to at GFYH podcast. Is that it? Yeah. At GFYH podcast.
[12:00.220 --> 12:04.020]  Damn, my brain went blank. I haven't even lit this joint yet. So send me a tweet there.
[12:04.020 --> 12:06.980]  Let me know what you're smoking on. I would love to hear it because I'm going to light
[12:06.980 --> 12:11.240]  this joint and then we're going to get to the main topic of this podcast. The main topic
[12:11.240 --> 12:16.440]  is going to be, it's kind of a double topic. It's male selection and starting a breeding
[12:16.440 --> 12:20.640]  project. I got multiple emails about male selection and breeding projects. I'm going
[12:20.640 --> 12:25.320]  to choose two of those emails and read them to you. And then we will also talk about pollen
[12:25.320 --> 12:30.000]  storage and we'll talk about another product. So let's light this joint and then we'll read
[12:30.000 --> 12:40.920]  an email. That tastes really good. I don't smoke a whole bunch of flour. So when I do
[12:40.920 --> 12:44.880]  light a big joint of some weed that I grew, it was dried and cured perfectly and trimmed
[12:44.880 --> 12:53.810]  by me. Oh, it's a real treat. Oh, and it burns nicely. I did a good job. You guys,
[12:53.810 --> 13:03.110]  I wish somebody was here to pass this joint to. Okay, we're going to smoke this joint
[13:03.110 --> 13:08.470]  and read an email. The email goes like this. Hi, Ross to Jeff. I discovered your podcast
[13:08.470 --> 13:11.870]  a couple of months ago and I've become an avid fan. You present a perfect balance of
[13:11.870 --> 13:17.230]  friendly personality and real information. Many, in fact, I'd say most cannabis podcasters
[13:17.230 --> 13:22.150]  do too much of one or the other. Like many of your fans. My only problem is wanting more
[13:22.150 --> 13:26.710]  episodes and for them to be longer. I'm working on a longer episode. You guys, I hope you've
[13:26.710 --> 13:30.830]  noticed that the last episode was a lot longer. And when Mike is here at the episodes get
[13:30.830 --> 13:38.940]  really long. So I'm trying to make them a little bit longer for you. This joint is just
[13:38.940 --> 13:42.420]  hitting like a champ. You guys, I'm going to keep puffing on it. This whole area is
[13:42.420 --> 13:47.740]  cloudy already. Anyway, the email goes on to say, I particularly enjoy hearing all about
[13:47.740 --> 13:51.340]  your breeding projects. I was wondering if you might be able to talk on the show about
[13:51.340 --> 13:56.020]  how you would go about starting a small breeding project from the ground up, because it's something
[13:56.020 --> 14:00.660]  I'd really like to explore in the future. I'd like to know about your strategy for choosing
[14:00.660 --> 14:05.020]  strains or for choosing traits and strains you want to cross and how you keep a male
[14:05.020 --> 14:10.220]  you like such as Solomon going for multiple breeds and how long the process from ideal
[14:10.220 --> 14:16.820]  idea to stable seeds takes. Also, I run the mom department at a large dispensary in Denver.
[14:16.820 --> 14:21.020]  And because I have limited space to work with, I have started using bonsai techniques such
[14:21.020 --> 14:25.500]  as root pruning to keep the mom small. With this technique, they live fairly happy in
[14:25.500 --> 14:31.540]  a two gallon pot indefinitely, staying around a foot or two tall. So far, my oldest is about
[14:31.540 --> 14:36.020]  a year old and her clones still root and produce healthy plants. I was wondering if you have
[14:36.020 --> 14:39.820]  any knowledge or experience with this method that you would want to share with someone
[14:39.820 --> 14:44.660]  who is trying it out. Honestly, um, teach me that method, please, because my mother
[14:44.660 --> 14:49.500]  plants grow so quickly that I have to put them into larger pots. And this sounds like
[14:49.500 --> 14:53.380]  something that would benefit me because I try to keep a large amount of mother plants
[14:53.380 --> 14:59.140]  and I don't have a lot of space. So, um, please send me your tech on this, share that with
[14:59.140 --> 15:04.460]  me, and I will talk about it more on the show for other listeners. So the email goes on
[15:04.460 --> 15:08.580]  to say, lastly, I was hoping you could give this dad amateur a few tips on not coughing
[15:08.580 --> 15:14.300]  so hard after dabs. Thanks for all the great podcasts that keep me smiling and learning.
[15:14.300 --> 15:18.740]  Cheers, Jessica. She actually says PS, you can use my first name on the podcast if you
[15:18.740 --> 15:24.420]  want to. She also included her Instagram handle and I am now following you there. Thanks
[15:24.420 --> 15:29.260]  for the email. Let's go over a couple of those things real quick. First off, thanks for the
[15:29.260 --> 15:34.340]  compliment. You started the email by complimenting me. I do appreciate that. I do need to learn
[15:34.340 --> 15:38.300]  more about your mother plant tech, but then you said you were hoping that I could give
[15:38.300 --> 15:43.980]  you a few tips on not coughing so hard after dabs. I am going to reveal some Jedi secrets
[15:43.980 --> 15:49.140]  for you. First off, if you're coughing a lot, your nail may be too hot. Let that nail
[15:49.140 --> 15:54.420]  cool. Go for some low temp dabs. You probably know that already. So I'm going to teach you
[15:54.420 --> 16:00.980]  some Rasta Jeff tricks here. I take gigantic dabs. Um, I know that a lot of my lung health
[16:00.980 --> 16:07.940]  and how large my dabs can be, how able, how my ability to take large dabs directly correlates
[16:07.940 --> 16:12.380]  with my level of hydration. That's what I'm trying to say. If I don't drink enough water
[16:12.380 --> 16:18.300]  and I get dry, my lungs get sore and I cannot take the dabs that I desire to take. It hurts.
[16:18.300 --> 16:23.500]  So I have to stay hydrated. I have to drink plenty of water. The more water I drink, the
[16:23.500 --> 16:28.540]  bigger dabs I can take. That is the truth. Also, I have to exercise my lungs and allow
[16:28.540 --> 16:33.380]  my lungs time to rest. Your lungs are, they need rest. They're like a giant muscle. They
[16:33.380 --> 16:35.980]  expand and contract. I don't know that they're really a muscle, but they work that way. They
[16:35.980 --> 16:38.700]  get bigger, they get smaller, they grow. You breathe in, you breathe out, you're putting
[16:38.700 --> 16:42.380]  a lot of work on them. They need some time to rest. Uh, when I get up, I need to breathe
[16:42.380 --> 16:45.260]  for a little bit before I take some dabs. I have to get the lungs going. I have to get
[16:45.260 --> 16:49.740]  the heart rate moving. I got to get the blood moving. I do some breathing. So then it's
[16:49.740 --> 16:55.260]  time to dab. I do not do like a pre dab breathe exercise. I just breathe. I like to let the
[16:55.260 --> 17:01.380]  lungs wake up, let my body get breathing. Then I'll take my first dab. If my first dad
[17:01.380 --> 17:04.780]  makes me want to choke, I can control my body. I said this to a friend. I've said this to
[17:04.780 --> 17:09.860]  a couple of people. Most of us, if you get like a leg twitch or a leg cramp or a leg
[17:09.860 --> 17:13.620]  itch, or if your foot itches or something, you don't just fall on the ground and start
[17:13.620 --> 17:17.740]  twitching and you don't go out of control and you don't just give up. Like maybe your
[17:17.740 --> 17:21.500]  children do that. I've seen kids do it. It's fucking hilarious, but we don't do that as
[17:21.500 --> 17:26.860]  adults. So why would we let our lungs be out of control? Like you've got control of your,
[17:26.860 --> 17:30.480]  unless you're sick or something. I'm not trying to make fun of anybody, but a normal human
[17:30.480 --> 17:35.640]  being a normal adult person, myself, I would not accept my leg just walking out from underneath
[17:35.640 --> 17:40.440]  me. That's not tolerated. So if my leg starts to get a cramp or something, I use my mind
[17:40.440 --> 17:44.600]  and I control my legs and I say, stand still motherfucker. So I do the same thing with
[17:44.600 --> 17:49.380]  my lungs. You guys, if I'm about to choke, my lungs are mine. I do not have to let my
[17:49.380 --> 17:55.160]  lungs do this rapid expansion and make me choke and turn purple and feel like shit.
[17:55.160 --> 17:59.880]  When I'm about to cough, I breathe in as hard as I can. You feel that tickle. You go, and
[17:59.880 --> 18:04.600]  your body goes, and your chest does this instant move. When I feel that coming, I breathe
[18:04.600 --> 18:09.920]  in as hard as I can. And now I've just changed my lungs mind. It wanted to cough, but it's
[18:09.920 --> 18:13.640]  like, Oh, he's I'm busy. I can't cough because he's got me inhaling. And then as soon as
[18:13.640 --> 18:19.880]  I get that breath as far in me as I can, uh, I push out, I parse my lips and I push my,
[18:19.880 --> 18:25.800]  my smoke goes out at this point. I push out as hard as I can, but through parsed lips,
[18:25.800 --> 18:29.400]  I talked about this in the past episode. I keep my lips kind of together to keep that
[18:29.400 --> 18:34.720]  air coming out slowly. So now there's pressure on my lung, but I'm not blowing out all that
[18:34.720 --> 18:41.200]  smoke at one ridiculous time. And that's keeping my lung busy. And I can't, I'm so busy focusing
[18:41.200 --> 18:46.720]  on that breath that my lungs will not twitch. I am Jedi mind tricking myself. I am yoga
[18:46.720 --> 18:51.480]  breathing. I am Lamaze breathing, and I'm just tricking my body into not being able
[18:51.480 --> 18:56.960]  to cough by keeping it busy. Uh, there's a guy by the name of Wim Hoff who teaches a
[18:56.960 --> 19:01.320]  lot of breathing techniques and a lot of body healing technique just through breathing.
[19:01.320 --> 19:07.400]  A lot of yoga is based on breathing. A lot of meditation is based on breathing. Um, Lamaze
[19:07.400 --> 19:13.960]  is all breathing. I feel like if these things can get you through huge situations in life,
[19:13.960 --> 19:18.160]  women use Lamaze to get through childbirth. I delivered a child. I'm a father. My child
[19:18.160 --> 19:22.480]  was born at home. I delivered that kid. I saw the kind of breathing that mama had to
[19:22.480 --> 19:26.880]  do to not lose her shit. It was the only thing she had. She could scream at me. She could
[19:26.880 --> 19:31.960]  have faith in whatever she has faith in and she could breathe. And breathing is the one
[19:31.960 --> 19:37.800]  thing I could physically see, get her through the pain and the challenge of having a child.
[19:37.800 --> 19:42.040]  So breathing is magical. Control your breath. That's what I'm trying to say. Don't let,
[19:42.040 --> 19:44.880]  you don't let your legs run out from underneath you. You don't let your hand punch you in
[19:44.880 --> 19:49.240]  the face. You don't let your lungs spaz out and cough. Just take a big breath. Sometimes
[19:49.240 --> 19:53.560]  you got to go into your nose. Sometimes you got to go into the mouth. You'll figure it
[19:53.560 --> 19:58.240]  out. It's all about just tricking your lungs. And then once you get that huge, powerful
[19:58.240 --> 20:02.400]  breath going in and out, just repeat that feeling. And it'll only take two or three
[20:02.400 --> 20:06.000]  breaths to get your lungs to not even want to choke anymore. And once you get good at
[20:06.000 --> 20:09.800]  it, you'll be able to control it a lot. I'm not sure if what I'm doing to myself is good
[20:09.800 --> 20:15.040]  for my body, but I'm sure that the violent coughing fits that you get when you take too
[20:15.040 --> 20:21.320]  big of a dab are not good for your body either. So I am probably saving myself some stress.
[20:21.320 --> 20:25.600]  I think that your lungs only get so many expansion and contractions and inhales and
[20:25.600 --> 20:29.440]  exhales and so many coughs before something starts to go wrong. They're like any car part
[20:29.440 --> 20:33.640]  or whatever, they're going to blow out. And so I'm just trying to get as many miles on
[20:33.640 --> 20:38.240]  my lungs as I can without blowing them out. That's what I'm trying to do. I think a lot
[20:38.240 --> 20:43.640]  of what I learned, the breathing technique came from a man by the name of Sergio Herrera.
[20:43.640 --> 20:48.080]  Shout out to Sergio Herrera and Sergio Jr. When I was a youngster, I took a karate class
[20:48.080 --> 20:53.560]  instructed by Master Sergio Herrera, and he taught us a lot about breathing. And now
[20:53.560 --> 20:57.880]  I'm remembering how far back I've been using breathing techniques to calm my body and my
[20:57.880 --> 21:02.800]  mind. When we would run out of breath, he would work us. The karate instructor would
[21:02.800 --> 21:06.680]  work you until you were exhausted, and they would make you control your breath. He would
[21:06.680 --> 21:11.880]  make you breathe in as deeply as you could through your nose. And once you've got your
[21:11.880 --> 21:15.520]  lungs are filled with air, your chest is fully expanded, you feel like you're full, he would
[21:15.520 --> 21:19.160]  tell you breathing a little more, a little more, and you just you just have to like force
[21:19.160 --> 21:23.200]  in a little breath through your nose. And you're just trying to suck in this last bit
[21:23.200 --> 21:26.960]  of air. And then once he thinks you're full, and he's satisfied, he'll tell you now blow
[21:26.960 --> 21:30.160]  all the way out and he would make us blow out and he would say there's more in there
[21:30.160 --> 21:34.360]  blow it out. And he'd be trying to force your like you'd be squeezing weird muscles to force
[21:34.360 --> 21:39.080]  your lungs to push out that last bit of air. And your body would make weird noises because
[21:39.080 --> 21:42.600]  you're trying to push air out that's not there. And then he would immediately make you breathe
[21:42.600 --> 21:47.880]  right in again as hard as you can now go deep. And that was how I would slow my heart
[21:47.880 --> 21:52.960]  rate and my breathing and get control get my composure again when I was in a spar or
[21:52.960 --> 21:56.960]  a karate tournament or a match and my heart rate my mind we're getting away or my breathing
[21:56.960 --> 22:00.920]  was getting away. That was our way to recenter and it works. It only takes two or three of
[22:00.920 --> 22:06.800]  those five of those and you are on top of your game all over again. So the trick to
[22:06.800 --> 22:11.400]  not coughing is control your lungs be a Jedi about it. Keep your lungs busy. Your lungs
[22:11.400 --> 22:15.160]  can't freak out and start coughing if you're controlling them and your mind and your lungs
[22:15.160 --> 22:19.640]  are stuck together. You're just focused on that breathing that in and out. The only things
[22:19.640 --> 22:25.000]  you got to do breathe in breathe out. So I do want to answer more of your breathing question
[22:25.000 --> 22:28.880]  but I've got another email that I want to read and I will answer both of the questions
[22:28.880 --> 22:32.760]  kind of at once. So I'm finding the other email it's here in my phone I promise this
[22:32.760 --> 22:36.680]  email has a lot of stuff going on so it'll take me a second to get through it but it
[22:36.680 --> 22:40.240]  goes like this and by the way just in case you're wondering I'm a little more than halfway
[22:40.440 --> 22:44.320]  through this joint. I've been puffing it when you don't hear me talking and I'm getting
[22:44.320 --> 22:49.920]  well medicated. All right this email goes like this. Hey Ross and Jeff how's it going?
[22:49.920 --> 22:55.080]  I've been listening to your podcast for a while now and I have a few questions on breeding.
[22:55.080 --> 22:59.920]  I'm out here in Colorado just doing it. I have a new tree of life high CBD strain going.
[22:59.920 --> 23:06.840]  I had 100% germination and 50% male to female ratio pretty solid I'd say. I was wondering
[23:06.880 --> 23:12.240]  when selecting a male to use for pollination as the father what do you look for? That is
[23:12.240 --> 23:15.640]  a very good question. I'm going to talk about that in just a second but I want to get through
[23:15.640 --> 23:21.840]  your email. You also say do you do any testing on the leaves to find CBD or THC content?
[23:21.840 --> 23:26.780]  And he also mentions that he's obviously looking for the lowest THC possible as to keep them
[23:26.780 --> 23:33.280]  under the .3% THC. So if you want your plants to qualify as hemp in Colorado they have to
[23:33.280 --> 23:40.280]  test at less than .3% THC or they are considered cannabis and you can't sell them, you can't
[23:41.040 --> 23:46.560]  sell that flower as hemp flower and it has to be grown in a completely different environment
[23:46.560 --> 23:50.620]  with completely different licensing. And if it tests too high, if you grow your hemp at
[23:50.620 --> 23:54.960]  a hemp farm and it tests too high in THC it must be destroyed. So he's trying to breed
[23:54.960 --> 24:01.080]  and he's trying to keep it low THC high CBD. The email goes on to say is there any truth
[24:01.080 --> 24:06.480]  in having males growing next to females could make the females hermy? I heard that recently
[24:06.480 --> 24:10.440]  somewhere. So he's asking if having males grow next to the females will make the females
[24:10.440 --> 24:15.000]  herm. No, that will not make the females herm. If you have males near your female plants
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.480]  I feel like the females know the males are there and they get stickier and the trichomes
[24:19.480 --> 24:26.040]  get a little thicker and it's like I think the female plants can smell the males or they
[24:26.040 --> 24:30.440]  can feel a pheromone or a hormone in the air and they get a little hornier and they show
[24:30.480 --> 24:35.880]  more signs of wanting pollen. So no, having a male plant near your female plants will
[24:35.880 --> 24:42.000]  not make the females herm but what will happen is the males will pollinate the females and
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.800]  it will not take much pollen and it will not take a lot of time. So the females won't herm,
[24:46.800 --> 24:51.200]  they will seed because they were properly pollinated. Now you say when breeding when
[24:51.200 --> 24:55.960]  is the best time to hit the ladies with pollen? I'm going to talk about that here in more
[24:55.960 --> 25:01.800]  of my breeding rant when I combine the two emails with one answer. Oh and I just realized
[25:01.800 --> 25:06.060]  that I skipped right over your part about asking about testing. I do not do any testing
[25:06.060 --> 25:11.400]  on the leaves to find CBD or THC content. However, that is a very useful option that
[25:11.400 --> 25:16.400]  is available from our friends at Steep Hill Labs. So if you want to do that I highly encourage
[25:16.400 --> 25:21.520]  that. That will give you an idea but it will not give you the exact potency but it will
[25:21.520 --> 25:25.880]  give you an idea of what the ratios will be. So you can have the leaves tested. Once again
[25:25.880 --> 25:30.560]  I would recommend Steep Hill Labs for that. They can also do early testing to tell you
[25:30.560 --> 25:36.080]  if your plants from seed are males or females. So I'm going to continue with the email. Where
[25:36.080 --> 25:41.720]  was I? It also says will they need 6-7 weeks to fully mature? I'm going to talk about that
[25:41.720 --> 25:46.200]  in a little more detail in just a couple of minutes. You also go on to say I have a lot
[25:46.200 --> 25:51.740]  of testing to be done on my 10 female phenos, 5 cherry wine F3 and 5 cobblers. Testing to
[25:51.740 --> 25:59.140]  begin at day 43 of flower to day 56 per pheno to find that highest CBD content and lowest
[25:59.140 --> 26:04.420]  THC content. Good luck with your pheno hunting. Pheno hunting is always fun. I love doing
[26:04.420 --> 26:09.260]  a nice pheno hunt. I hope you find the phenotype that you're looking for. I hope you find that
[26:09.260 --> 26:14.180]  perfect CBD for yourself. I hope you're able to make great medicine. I hope this project
[26:14.180 --> 26:17.980]  goes well. You go on to say thank you for your time and keep the podcast going. I only
[26:17.980 --> 26:22.500]  came across yours recently. Been listening to a bunch of your old ones. Is there access
[26:22.500 --> 26:28.740]  to some of your older ones that are not in the feed? I'm not sure how many episodes Stitcher
[26:28.740 --> 26:34.380]  is holding, but iTunes has the most recent 100 episodes. So if you're able to listen
[26:34.380 --> 26:40.860]  via iTunes, you can get 100 episodes. If you're listening through my website, iRegeneticsColorado.com,
[26:40.860 --> 26:45.860]  you can go to the iRegeneticsColorado.com website. There's a Grow From Your Heart podcast
[26:45.860 --> 26:50.500]  tab. Click on that. That will take you to the podcast. To the best of my knowledge,
[26:50.500 --> 26:56.020]  there should be 100 episodes available there, which will get you all the way back to, we're
[26:56.020 --> 27:02.020]  at 174, so you'll get all the way back to about 75, which that's a lot of content. However,
[27:02.020 --> 27:07.540]  if you do want the old stuff, I plan on putting the older episodes back into the feed. Just
[27:07.540 --> 27:12.140]  redropping them is kind of like new episodes. I'll add a new intro. I'll talk to you a minute,
[27:12.140 --> 27:16.500]  let you know it's a repeat, and we'll put the old episodes back. If you're impatient
[27:16.500 --> 27:23.060]  and you don't want to wait for that, send me an email and I will consider sending you
[27:23.060 --> 27:28.780]  the files for older episodes. I don't know how many I can do at a time. If I get several
[27:28.780 --> 27:32.580]  people that want them together, I'll try to send them in chunks. So if there are a few
[27:32.580 --> 27:36.620]  of you that want those old episodes sent in chunks, send me an email and I'll try to get
[27:36.620 --> 27:39.720]  them out to you guys. Maybe this will get something going. But I do intend on putting
[27:39.720 --> 27:44.760]  them back into the feed. So like starting around episode 200 was kind of my idea. We'll
[27:44.760 --> 27:49.720]  get 200 episodes out and then maybe once every two weeks or once a week on a Thursday, we'll
[27:49.720 --> 27:53.320]  just plop in. We'll do episode. I don't think I'm going to start with one because one was
[27:53.320 --> 27:58.360]  terrible, but we'll do like episode old episodes in not perfect order, but we'll do them in
[27:58.360 --> 28:02.840]  chronological order, but we may skip a few. So there will be a way to hear old episodes.
[28:02.840 --> 28:07.120]  And if you're really dying to hear those first few, send me an email. We'll figure it out.
[28:07.120 --> 28:11.040]  He goes on to say, all I do is garden and listen to podcasts. And it was funny to hear
[28:11.040 --> 28:16.080]  the ones you listen to were all the same ones I listened to all the comic podcasts for sure,
[28:16.080 --> 28:20.600]  except Bill Burr is at the top of my list and you had him down at the bottom of yours.
[28:20.600 --> 28:25.140]  Yeah, Bill Burr is a bit much for me. He gets a I know it's funny that I'm sitting here
[28:25.140 --> 28:30.160]  doing a podcast by myself, but to listen to Bill Burr rant by himself on a podcast sometimes
[28:30.160 --> 28:34.240]  isn't my favorite thing. And he talks about shit that I don't I'm not as spoiled. He talks
[28:34.240 --> 28:37.920]  a lot about goddamn sports and I don't care about football at all. So that's why I don't
[28:37.920 --> 28:42.720]  listen to Bill Burr as much as some people. I kind of religiously listen to Rogan, Doug Benson,
[28:42.720 --> 28:48.080]  Joey Coco Diaz. Those are a lot of my favorites. Also, I've been listening to a podcast that I
[28:48.080 --> 28:52.400]  think you guys would enjoy. Let me give a shout out to my friend, Bo Nellis. She's been getting
[28:52.400 --> 28:57.040]  a shout out on the past few podcasts, but she's been reciprocating on her show. She does a great
[28:57.040 --> 29:04.400]  podcast about cannabis. Her show is called the Spliff Podcast. And I know that I say the word
[29:04.400 --> 29:09.920]  spliff poorly because my voice, my mouth, my accent, the word spliff fucking sucks for my
[29:09.920 --> 29:14.320]  mouth. And now I've got cotton mouth from smoking this whole joint. So I'm probably saying it even
[29:14.320 --> 29:22.640]  worse. But the name of her podcast is Spliff, the spliff, S-P-L-I-F-F, the Spliff Podcast.
[29:22.640 --> 29:27.680]  So make sure you check out Bo Nellis at the Spliff Podcast. I think you would appreciate
[29:27.680 --> 29:32.400]  that. So you say, hit me back when you get a minute and then you sign the email with the name
[29:32.400 --> 29:36.720]  Buck. Bro, I hope this worked out as hitting you back. I will send you an email to let you know to
[29:36.720 --> 29:42.800]  listen to this episode, but dude, here's your official hit back. You guys, Jess and Buck,
[29:42.800 --> 29:46.560]  I appreciate both of you for the email. I appreciate both of you being interested in
[29:46.560 --> 29:50.560]  breeding. I need to take a quick drink, so I'm going to press pause and take a drink. And when
[29:50.560 --> 29:56.400]  I get back, I am going to rant a long time about starting a breeding project and selecting a good
[29:56.400 --> 30:26.800]  male. All right, podcast world, I am back. I am nicely hydrated. I am nicely medicated. I know
[30:26.800 --> 30:31.280]  I smoked that whole joint while we were talking, but something made me want to take some dabs while
[30:31.280 --> 30:34.720]  I was taking a break. So I took a couple of dabs and now my head is a little spinny and I feel
[30:34.720 --> 30:40.480]  super good. So let's get back to the podcast. You guys that asked for longer episodes are truly
[30:40.480 --> 30:43.840]  going to get what you've been asking for in this podcast, because I've been going for 30 minutes
[30:43.840 --> 30:49.120]  now and we're just about to get to the main topic. The main topic, of course, is breeding,
[30:49.120 --> 30:53.520]  setting up a breeding area and also selecting your males. And we'll talk a little bit about
[30:53.520 --> 30:59.280]  selecting your females for your breeding project. All right, the first thing I should talk about
[30:59.280 --> 31:03.760]  when you're going to start a breeding project is books. Where do books come into play? Books are
[31:03.760 --> 31:07.760]  the first thing. Before you do anything with cannabis, before you start growing, before you
[31:07.760 --> 31:12.400]  start breeding, before you start doing anything with weed, you should read about it. Read about
[31:12.400 --> 31:16.640]  growing. Be prepared. Know what's coming. I know you listen to a podcast that's all about weed,
[31:16.640 --> 31:21.520]  but I can't tell you everything. If you bought a basic grow book and read it from beginning to end
[31:21.520 --> 31:24.960]  and then started growing weed, you would be prepared for all the shit that's coming and you
[31:24.960 --> 31:30.720]  wouldn't be in scramble mode. So books, get some books. Read about breeding. Just read the basics
[31:30.720 --> 31:35.280]  of breeding. Two books that I could really recommend are the Cannabis Breeders Bible by
[31:35.280 --> 31:42.240]  Greg Green. That is available online in a PDF for free. So you have no excuse. Go online, type in
[31:42.240 --> 31:49.040]  Cannabis Breeders Bible. It'll pop up as a PDF in Google. Go read that. Also, I truly recommend a
[31:49.040 --> 31:53.760]  book that I'm pulling up on my phone here. It is called, it's just simply Marijuana Botany by Robert
[31:53.760 --> 31:59.440]  Connell Clark. I highly recommend both of those books if you're going to do any breeding. If you
[31:59.440 --> 32:05.360]  want to read further about cannabis growing, I also recommend anything from Jorge Cervantes. I also
[32:05.360 --> 32:10.960]  like Let's Grow a Pound. I also like all of the Ed Rosenthal grow books. The Ed Rosenthal
[32:10.960 --> 32:17.600]  Oakster Damn Course Guide is a great grow book in my opinion. But start with the Cannabis Breeders
[32:17.600 --> 32:23.040]  Bible, then move on to Marijuana Botany and you will have a great basic understanding of cannabis.
[32:23.840 --> 32:28.880]  So once you have an understanding of cannabis and a kind of an idea for breeding, you need to build
[32:28.880 --> 32:35.600]  a grow room or use your existing grow room for a breeding area. So a breeding room is just like any
[32:35.600 --> 32:40.400]  other grow room. You need a grow light. You need it sealed up. You need a sealed room so that when
[32:40.400 --> 32:46.320]  it is dark, a light seal is what I mean. When it is dark, you cannot have any light coming into that
[32:46.320 --> 32:52.320]  room. So whenever you choose to have your dark period for 12 hours at a time, there can be no
[32:52.320 --> 32:57.520]  light interruptions, no light leaks. So you need a room with a light on a timer. You need a
[32:57.520 --> 33:02.560]  controllable dark time. You need to be able to get water to that room and you need to be able to get
[33:02.560 --> 33:09.280]  old air out and fresh air into that room. If you already have a grow room, it probably can be used
[33:09.280 --> 33:14.000]  just like it is. The only thing you need to consider is pollen. That room is going to get
[33:14.000 --> 33:20.720]  filled with pollen and wherever you were ducting your exhaust, pollen is going to go out there. So
[33:20.720 --> 33:26.480]  if you have an outdoor garden and you're ducting your grow room outside, you may be blowing pollen
[33:26.480 --> 33:31.520]  right into your outdoor garden. If you have another grow room that's in flower, you need to
[33:31.520 --> 33:37.440]  control where that pollen goes. A good way to keep tabs on pollen is water. Water deactivates pollen.
[33:38.400 --> 33:46.640]  You need to find a way to either spray yourself, your plants, both for pollen control. If you get
[33:46.640 --> 33:50.480]  pollen in one room, you're going to the other flower room. You need to hose yourself down and
[33:50.480 --> 33:54.880]  you need to spray down the female plants that you don't want pollinated and that'll keep the pollen
[33:54.880 --> 34:02.240]  away from them. So basically you need a grow room with at least a 600 watt light or larger. People
[34:03.040 --> 34:09.600]  will say that you can grow with a 400 or a 250 or an LED or a T5, but I think a 600 watt light
[34:09.600 --> 34:13.600]  is the smallest I would use for breeding because I want strong, healthy plants with strong,
[34:13.600 --> 34:19.120]  healthy seeds. If you're looking for an affordable way to set up a breeding area and you don't have
[34:19.120 --> 34:26.240]  a lot of space or a lot of funding, you can use a 5x5 or a 3x3 grow hut. I like to use the 5x5
[34:26.240 --> 34:32.240]  grow hut with a 600 watt or a 1000 watt light. The 600 watt light is plenty of light for a 5x5
[34:32.240 --> 34:36.800]  hut. Trust me. In the summer, I'll put a 600 in there. In the winter, I'll put a 1000 in there
[34:36.800 --> 34:41.360]  because of course you can cool it much more easily in the winter. The rooms are cold anyway because
[34:41.360 --> 34:46.320]  it's freezing outside. So you just use that 1000 watt light to keep everything warm. Take advantage
[34:46.320 --> 34:51.280]  of your surroundings, guys. That's what I think I'm saying. So get a 5x5 hut, put a 600 watt light
[34:51.280 --> 34:58.480]  in there. I like to put a ducted hood in my huts. So I've got a 5x5 hut with a ducted, I think it's
[34:58.480 --> 35:03.040]  like the extra sun six or the daystar six, something like that. Just a basic hood in there.
[35:03.040 --> 35:08.400]  And it's got six inch ducting coming off of both sides. And there is a hole for the ducting on each
[35:08.400 --> 35:14.240]  side of the hut. So that ducting goes out of each side of the hut. And on one end, I've got a blower
[35:14.240 --> 35:18.800]  with a carbon filter. So the air comes through the carbon filter, through the blower, through
[35:18.800 --> 35:24.080]  the ducting, into the hut, over the light, out of the light, out of the hut, and then it just blows
[35:24.080 --> 35:29.440]  that air into the room. Basically blows it into another room for me is where I have it running.
[35:29.440 --> 35:34.720]  But what that does is it keeps the light, the heat from the light never gets to go into my grow hut.
[35:34.720 --> 35:40.240]  So it kind of keeps my hut a little bit cooler. Also, there's a six inch hole on the roof of those
[35:40.240 --> 35:47.760]  grow huts. I get a six inch hydro farm, a blower, and just set it on top of the hut, extracting air
[35:47.760 --> 35:52.240]  so it sucks air out. And when you zip up the hut, it kind of caves in a little bit because of all
[35:52.240 --> 35:57.200]  the pressure. But that's a good thing. Because it's sucking air in through the bottom, it's sucking in
[35:57.200 --> 36:02.080]  fresh air constantly and shooting out hot stale air from the top all the time and heat rises. So
[36:02.080 --> 36:06.480]  I'm pulling in cool air from the bottom of the room that the hut is in. And it's just shooting
[36:06.480 --> 36:10.720]  that air to the top. So I'm always having circulation in there. I've got a light running,
[36:11.280 --> 36:16.160]  the light is being cooled. So you've got two blowers, you got a reflector with a light in it,
[36:16.160 --> 36:20.480]  you've got a little bit of ducting, and a five by five hut. That's basically all you need.
[36:20.480 --> 36:25.680]  And you can set up a breeding room. It would be helpful if you could have a separate space for
[36:25.680 --> 36:30.480]  your male plant to start flowering. And so that you can keep your males and females apart until
[36:30.480 --> 36:35.360]  the ideal time for pollination. But it's not absolutely necessary if you're breeding for
[36:35.360 --> 36:40.480]  personal seed production. If you keep the plants apart for a little longer, you're able to make a
[36:40.480 --> 36:46.000]  lot more seed is mainly the reason for doing that. So something else I want to mention,
[36:46.000 --> 36:52.080]  I talked about pollen control. Pollen control is hugely important for flowering plants,
[36:52.080 --> 36:56.720]  plants that are flowering from about from the time they show the hairs you guys call them,
[36:56.720 --> 37:00.400]  probably those are pistols. Those are calyx pistols from the times those are shown from
[37:00.400 --> 37:06.080]  the time those appear, that plant is able to receive pollen and produce seeds. So if your
[37:06.080 --> 37:12.000]  plants have pistols, you need to keep pollen away from them. Veg plants cannot be pollinated. Do not
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.520]  worry about veg plants. So if you have veg plants, they'll be just fine. Before you put them near
[37:17.520 --> 37:22.560]  flowering plants, rinse them off with water. Any pollen that got on them will be deactivated.
[37:22.560 --> 37:27.680]  You'll be just fine. Also, if you've been in your garden, and your garden has pollen in it,
[37:27.680 --> 37:31.280]  and you've been messing with pollen, or if you've been pollinating your plants, don't go to your
[37:31.280 --> 37:35.360]  friend's house that grow because you don't want to fuck up their garden and see their whole garden.
[37:35.360 --> 37:41.200]  Don't go to the grocery store. Don't go to the dispensary. Change clothes. Take a shower. Be
[37:41.200 --> 37:45.600]  proactive. Don't fuck up someone else's garden with your pollen. And if you do have a male plant
[37:45.600 --> 37:50.480]  outside, pay attention to who else is growing around you. And you may be fucking up someone
[37:50.480 --> 37:55.120]  else's garden. Just be aware. Try to pay attention to what's going on like that. All right, so we
[37:55.120 --> 37:58.720]  talked about getting your room built. We talked about pollen control and how important pollen
[37:58.720 --> 38:03.920]  control is. Let's talk about nutrients. When you are breeding, basic nutrients can be used for your
[38:03.920 --> 38:08.640]  males and females. Just your basic flowering newts. I wouldn't use real heavy bloom boosters
[38:08.640 --> 38:13.600]  or anything like that. It's not really necessary. Keep your nitrogen, your phosphorus, your potassium
[38:13.600 --> 38:18.080]  in there. Keep some carbohydrates coming. Maybe add a little bit of amino acids for healthy seeds.
[38:18.080 --> 38:24.400]  But basically, your basic feed is going to be just fine for your seeded plants. All right,
[38:24.400 --> 38:28.560]  so we've got a little breeding room built, and we know what to feed our plants. Now I feel like it's
[38:28.560 --> 38:33.600]  time to talk about selecting your plants for a breeding project. A big part about breeding is
[38:33.600 --> 38:38.960]  having a goal in mind. You need to have kind of an idea of what you're trying to create with your
[38:38.960 --> 38:43.520]  breeding project. Are you trying to make seeds for yourself so that you can keep growing in the
[38:43.520 --> 38:48.000]  future with fresh seeds? Are you trying to breed new strains? Are you trying to take a strain that
[38:48.000 --> 38:53.840]  is okay and improve it? Are you trying to back cross something? Have a goal in mind. Think about
[38:53.840 --> 38:59.120]  what you're trying to create, what you're trying to improve. As a breeder, it's your job to improve
[38:59.120 --> 39:05.440]  the cannabis plant and not go backwards. If the seeds that come out of your breeding project are
[39:05.440 --> 39:12.000]  not better than the buds that they came from, you can throw the entire project away and start
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.120]  another breeding project. You are trying to make something better. All right, so let's talk a little
[39:17.120 --> 39:21.920]  bit about selecting females. Something you will get from the books that I did not talk about earlier
[39:21.920 --> 39:27.920]  are charts. You may want to learn about aleol charts and mendal charts. There are a lot of
[39:27.920 --> 39:33.200]  different charts to use. They are very helpful. If you're trying to target specific traits,
[39:33.200 --> 39:38.880]  use charts. If you're trying to create new crosses to see what you can do with your favorite strains,
[39:38.880 --> 39:43.680]  go ahead and throw some pollen and see what happens, but make sure you test those seeds
[39:43.680 --> 39:48.240]  very well before you give them out to anybody. All right, something else I want to talk about
[39:48.240 --> 39:52.880]  is using stable females. A lot of people will get a clone and they'll say, hey, I've got this plant,
[39:52.880 --> 39:55.600]  I want to breed to it. They'll get a male and they put some pollen on it.
[39:56.800 --> 40:01.280]  Always grow out a new clone at least two or three times before you breed with it.
[40:01.280 --> 40:06.960]  I like to put my females through a rigorous stress test before I breed with them. I will put my
[40:06.960 --> 40:11.680]  female plants into flower. I'll let them flower for seven to 10 days and then I will completely
[40:11.680 --> 40:17.840]  fuck up the timer in the grow room on purpose. My goal is to try to make these plants hermaphrodite
[40:17.840 --> 40:23.120]  by stressing them with light stress, by disrupting their photo period. I'll turn the light on,
[40:23.120 --> 40:29.360]  I'll go from 12, 12 and then I will turn it off for 24 hours and then I will turn it on for 24
[40:29.360 --> 40:34.320]  hours and then I'll put it back on 12, 12 and I'll pay attention to the plants. Some plants will herm
[40:34.320 --> 40:39.600]  with that much disruption. Some of them take a little more, so I'll fuck with them again. I'll
[40:39.600 --> 40:44.880]  turn the light on for 24 hours again and then turn it off for 12 hours, then turn it on for six or
[40:44.880 --> 40:49.680]  eight hours, then we'll go right back to the normal flowering cycle. I'll do this throughout
[40:49.680 --> 40:55.600]  the bloom phase and by day 35 if something hasn't hermed, I will consider it probably strong enough
[40:55.600 --> 40:59.440]  to go into a breeding project. Of course I'll finish it out, but I want to kind of fuck with
[40:59.440 --> 41:03.280]  these plants and see if they're hermaphrodite or not on me from messing with them and causing them
[41:03.280 --> 41:09.040]  stress. Because the people that buy seeds are going to mess up and I want the progeny that
[41:09.040 --> 41:13.360]  comes from my breeding projects to be a little bit foolproof because I want to give people a head
[41:13.360 --> 41:18.080]  start and not make them struggle from the beginning. Alright, so use females that are tested,
[41:18.080 --> 41:22.720]  that are trusted, that you've grown several times. I like to use females that have desirable traits
[41:22.720 --> 41:27.040]  that I love, that I think I can make a little bit better. Breeding is kind of like chefing.
[41:27.600 --> 41:31.200]  You're about to put ingredients from the male plant with ingredients from the female plant
[41:31.200 --> 41:34.160]  together. You're going to stir them up and then you're going to grow that and you're going to
[41:34.160 --> 41:38.960]  have a cake and that cake is your finished buds. So keep that in mind when you're making a cross.
[41:39.040 --> 41:44.560]  You want a female that's got a good node structure, that the inner node spacing is not too far apart
[41:44.560 --> 41:50.000]  on the main stalk. You want a female that flowers in a good amount of time. I like 70 day plants
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.480]  honestly. A lot of people like plants that are done in 60 days. I feel like a 70 day flowering
[41:54.480 --> 42:00.000]  plant has a lot of time to get the good quality sativa style THC buzz that I like. The indica
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.480]  plants don't give me that head buzz that I like. So a little longer plant, something that smells
[42:04.480 --> 42:10.400]  real good and something that just grows real well and is desirable to smoke, that's a female plant
[42:10.400 --> 42:16.240]  that you want to breed to. Plants with a lot of resin usually produce offspring with a lot of
[42:16.240 --> 42:23.200]  resin. So the more resinous your female plants, the more likely you are to produce resiny offspring.
[42:23.200 --> 42:28.480]  So basically your favorite females are great for breeding. Everybody knows by now what a good female
[42:28.480 --> 42:35.040]  plant looks like. That should be easy to find. So have a goal, find a female plant. You can use more
[42:35.040 --> 42:39.920]  than one female in a breeding project. There's nothing stopping you from putting... I do several
[42:39.920 --> 42:45.760]  females in a room at one time. I grow them kind of big and then I'll put... I do probably six.
[42:45.760 --> 42:52.640]  I like to do six seven gallon pots per thousand watt light and I fudge them up to about just
[42:52.640 --> 42:57.280]  between knee and waist height. I'm six foot five so I'm going to say that's probably about you know
[42:57.280 --> 43:03.360]  24 to 28 inches tall. Fudge them about that tall and then I like to flower them and then when it's
[43:03.360 --> 43:08.240]  time I like to give them pollen and I get plenty of seeds from each plant. Sometimes each of those
[43:08.240 --> 43:13.360]  six plants under one light will be a different strain. If I'm creating something new I will do
[43:13.360 --> 43:20.400]  six different plants in there just to see what I can create and I'll run all of those six new crosses
[43:20.400 --> 43:24.960]  myself to see what I've created and if it's something that I love I will fill a light with
[43:24.960 --> 43:29.920]  just one strain and repeat the process and make a bunch more seeds so that we can put them to the
[43:29.920 --> 43:34.160]  market or we can just do whatever needs to be done with them. So the first time I cross it I just do
[43:34.160 --> 43:40.000]  a whole bunch of plants in there and then I find the best of that new cross, the best cross
[43:40.000 --> 43:45.680]  of that new project and I repeat those. So it's kind of a process of elimination you guys. The
[43:45.680 --> 43:51.920]  things that you see come to market from me is a very small portion of what I create. I honestly
[43:51.920 --> 43:57.680]  don't continue a lot of things. So those six that I put under one light I'll put six different girls
[43:57.680 --> 44:03.520]  under there. I'll use one male and pollinate those. Maybe two or three of those will get repeated and
[44:03.520 --> 44:08.960]  the rest will get abandoned and I won't make more of that cross. So you can put multiple females in
[44:08.960 --> 44:13.360]  the room for breeding and you can make multiple different crosses. If you're making seeds for
[44:13.360 --> 44:17.360]  yourself that's a really fun way to do it. Then you can find a whole bunch of great new things.
[44:18.800 --> 44:24.560]  Now I'm going to do a little bit of talking about male selection. I did an entire podcast about
[44:24.560 --> 44:30.560]  selecting males. Episode number 121 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast is all about male selection.
[44:30.560 --> 44:35.120]  If you want a really in-depth podcast about choosing a male for breeding check out episode
[44:35.120 --> 44:40.480]  number 121. It will give you a lot of information but if you don't want to go back and listen to
[44:40.480 --> 44:46.320]  that one here is the short course for this episode. Choosing a male is very important because
[44:46.320 --> 44:52.560]  I think the male will provide a lot of the aroma, a lot of the structure, and a lot of the general
[44:52.560 --> 44:57.120]  health of the plant. The pest resistance, the mold resistance, a lot of that is going to come from
[44:57.120 --> 45:03.200]  your male. So something I look for in a male plant is structure. The way the plant is shaped is going
[45:03.200 --> 45:08.160]  to predict a lot of what your females or your offspring, I'm sorry your progeny, are going to
[45:08.160 --> 45:13.600]  be shaped like. So if you want a sativa dominant plant that gets kind of tall that grows really
[45:13.600 --> 45:19.440]  tall colas you want a male that gets tall and has really tall colas. If you want a short stout indica
[45:19.440 --> 45:26.480]  dominant plant you want a male that grows short and stout and squat and is shaped the way you want
[45:26.480 --> 45:31.600]  it. So think about what you want out of your breeding. This is where having a goal comes into
[45:31.600 --> 45:37.760]  play. So structure is important to me. I like close close tight node structures. So when that stem
[45:37.760 --> 45:43.280]  starts growing I want a set of branches to come out and then I want about you know an inch and
[45:43.280 --> 45:48.160]  then another set of branches coming out and then like an inch and then more branches. Nice close
[45:48.160 --> 45:52.800]  tight internodal spacing. That's something I really like. Another thing I really pay attention
[45:52.800 --> 45:58.480]  to is the aroma of my male plants. I like to rub the stem with my fingers and then smell my fingers
[45:58.480 --> 46:04.080]  and see what it smells like. A plant that has a fruity smell is going to make fruity progeny.
[46:04.080 --> 46:09.280]  When I am breeding I kind of lean towards the more fuely more funky sort of smelling things.
[46:09.280 --> 46:14.400]  I have a male plant that smells like puke or vomit. That is a great male for breeding. I think
[46:14.400 --> 46:19.840]  it passes on great traits. One thing that I really like to see in a male plant and it's kind of odd
[46:19.840 --> 46:24.880]  it doesn't happen all the time but trichomes. I really love to see trichomes on a male plant.
[46:24.880 --> 46:29.680]  You have to let them flower. They have to get about four or five maybe even six weeks into flower
[46:30.240 --> 46:34.080]  before you'll see the trichomes and start dropping pollen. I would like the third or fourth one.
[46:34.080 --> 46:40.800]  That tells me that it is going to make trichome laden, maybe the fifth one but probably not.
[46:40.800 --> 46:46.640]  I'll explain why. The plants that flower too early and right away are going to be too
[46:46.640 --> 46:52.320]  purple when you get it cold. They're going to pass out way too much of their traits and they're not
[46:52.320 --> 46:58.480]  going to allow enough of the female traits to come across in the offspring. So I eliminate
[46:58.720 --> 47:05.040]  the early flowering males. The males that start dumping pollen the soonest, they usually get cold from the garden.
[47:05.040 --> 47:10.880]  That's a golden goat to daybreaker. It's an F1. I call it a rise. The male that I have chosen
[47:10.880 --> 47:16.400]  from that is known as King Solomon because he is the king. I know what he looks like nine weeks
[47:16.400 --> 47:21.840]  into flower. He keeps dumping pollen nine weeks into flower. That plant could probably go 10 or
[47:21.840 --> 47:26.800]  11 weeks no problem and stay nice and healthy with the way I feed it. It would look wonderful.
[47:27.520 --> 47:33.200]  I know what my plants do so pay attention to the color. That is going to pass on to your
[47:33.200 --> 47:38.960]  progeny. If it turns orange, if it turns purple, if it turns yellow, that is going to happen to the offspring.
[47:40.000 --> 47:46.320]  So also speed of development is something that I pay a lot of attention to. I do not want the male
[47:46.320 --> 47:53.600]  plants that start flowering early. If I get a 10 pack of seeds, hypothetically five of those seeds
[47:53.600 --> 48:00.080]  will be males. I do not want the first two to show me that they are males and start dropping
[48:00.080 --> 48:04.800]  pollen. I would like the third or fourth one is most likely going to be the plant that I choose
[48:04.800 --> 48:11.840]  for breeding. Maybe the fifth one but probably not and I'll explain why. The plants that flower too
[48:11.840 --> 48:17.920]  early and right away are going to be too dominant in the breeding cross. They're going to pass on
[48:17.920 --> 48:22.880]  way too much of their traits and they are not going to allow enough of the female traits to
[48:22.880 --> 48:29.680]  come across in the offspring. So I eliminate the early flowering males. The males that start
[48:29.680 --> 48:36.320]  dumping pollen the soonest, they usually get cold from my garden. So I'm paying attention to how long
[48:36.320 --> 48:41.440]  it takes these plants to show me that they're males, how long it takes for the male pollen sacs
[48:41.440 --> 48:46.960]  to start dropping, and also how long it takes for the pollen sacs to open and start dropping pollen.
[48:46.960 --> 48:51.600]  Those are things I'm really paying attention to. I also like to pay attention to how much pollen
[48:51.600 --> 48:56.960]  comes out and how long my plants will keep dumping pollen. Those are things that really matter to me.
[48:57.920 --> 49:02.160]  I think a lot of pollen is important because I make a lot of seeds. I like a plant that will
[49:02.160 --> 49:05.920]  keep going so that I can keep tapping it every couple of days and get some more pollen out of it
[49:05.920 --> 49:12.240]  if I need to. I like a nice robust male. A lot of times I'll try to find a male that looks very
[49:12.240 --> 49:18.240]  similar to a female that I like. So if I got a 10 pack of seeds and there was a female in there that
[49:18.240 --> 49:23.360]  I really liked, it was the perfect female out of the 10 pack, I hope for a male that has the same
[49:23.360 --> 49:27.760]  shape and the same characteristics as that female because I know that's going to kind of pass on
[49:27.760 --> 49:32.400]  those traits that I'm looking for. So something that I do not like out of a breeding plant is
[49:32.400 --> 49:37.520]  something that gets really tall, something that starts stretching and has a lot of inner node
[49:37.520 --> 49:42.080]  space. It's going to make too much fiber. It's going to be more hemp than cannabis. You're going
[49:42.080 --> 49:46.800]  to get a big stretchy plant. That's something I try to stay away from. If you've got a male that is
[49:46.800 --> 49:50.720]  just shooting above the canopy of all the other plants, just pull that one out because it's going
[49:50.720 --> 49:56.960]  to create problematic progeny. All right, so mainly you want a male with a good structure that smells
[49:56.960 --> 50:02.480]  good, that produces trichomes, that grows the way you want it. Usually if you get a 10 pack and you
[50:02.480 --> 50:06.960]  get five males, you're going to want that third or fourth male is going to be your breeder. That's my
[50:06.960 --> 50:12.240]  intuition. That's usually what I've noticed. So find the traits to that one, kind of notice that.
[50:12.240 --> 50:17.040]  Look for one that looks like a female that you like, and then you should have yourself a nice
[50:17.040 --> 50:22.960]  quality male plant. Make sure that it dumps plenty of pollen. Make sure that it produces nice, big,
[50:22.960 --> 50:28.720]  fat flower clusters. You want big, tight, fat male flowers. You don't want big, fluffy,
[50:28.720 --> 50:35.040]  sparse male flowers. You want it to look like a big cola of male flowers. The more male flowers,
[50:35.040 --> 50:38.240]  the better. That means you're going to pass on that trait and you're going to produce big,
[50:38.240 --> 50:44.800]  fat female buds. So fat male clusters are going to be a super desirable trait. Another thing you
[50:44.800 --> 50:49.920]  should not breed with, you guys, any plant that has ever shown any sign of hermaphrodism,
[50:49.920 --> 50:55.600]  do not breed with any hermaphrodites. If it shows bananas, ever do not breed with it.
[50:56.160 --> 50:59.840]  All right, so now we know how to select females. We know how to select males.
[50:59.840 --> 51:05.600]  Here is something else I want to talk about. If you were breeding to narrow down specific traits,
[51:05.600 --> 51:12.000]  if you want your progeny to look like a certain thing, then it is a good idea to select one male.
[51:12.000 --> 51:16.320]  If you've got a female and you've got a male and you're trying to get this part of this male on
[51:16.320 --> 51:22.000]  this part of this female into your cross, it is wise to use one male plant. However,
[51:22.560 --> 51:29.760]  if you want to open up the breeding and see what you can create, it's always fun to use multiple
[51:29.760 --> 51:36.160]  males of the same cross. So if you have got, let's just say a rise. If you're trying to breed
[51:36.160 --> 51:42.000]  with a rise, if you want to make a rise to... What did I do a rise to? A rise to lemon skunk. I call
[51:42.000 --> 51:49.280]  it a firefly. So you take a rise. I made a rise to lemon skunk. I used one arise male to one lemon
[51:49.280 --> 51:55.120]  skunk female because I knew what I wanted. I wanted to put this robust growth from a rise,
[51:55.120 --> 52:01.120]  this cola size from a rise, and this node structure and this thick branching into this
[52:01.120 --> 52:06.640]  really flavorful yet kind of wispy lemon skunk cross that I have. So that was my goal. So I knew
[52:06.640 --> 52:12.000]  that I wanted King Solomon by himself to pollinate that lemon skunk because my goal was the cross of
[52:12.000 --> 52:19.920]  those two. However, if I wanted to see what I could create without narrowing it down, and since
[52:19.920 --> 52:24.320]  I plan on selling these seeds and putting it to market, I wanted it to be a very close
[52:24.320 --> 52:28.960]  representation. I wanted to be able to predict what I was making is what I'm saying. If I wanted
[52:28.960 --> 52:34.320]  to open up the breeding and kind of create some chaos, I would put multiple arise males in there.
[52:34.320 --> 52:39.600]  I would grow out a bunch of arise seeds and I would find four males. And then I would put those
[52:39.600 --> 52:46.640]  four males in with whatever female plants I chose to. And I would use the pollen from all four of
[52:46.640 --> 52:51.200]  those arise males. And that's called an open pollination. And what that's going to do, it is
[52:51.200 --> 52:57.120]  going to show a lot of different phenotypes because now I've got four different fathers in there. So
[52:57.120 --> 53:02.240]  I'm going to get a lot of recessive traits from that male line that I would not have brought out
[53:02.240 --> 53:07.360]  by using one male. So if you want to narrow down traits, if you're trying to narrow down your
[53:07.360 --> 53:12.240]  breeding and get specific traits out, use one male. If you're trying to open up the breeding
[53:12.240 --> 53:18.880]  and find new cool shit, use multiple males. And that is called open pollination. For the multiple
[53:18.880 --> 53:24.640]  male method or for the single male method, you can use one female or you can use multiple females,
[53:24.640 --> 53:29.680]  however you do it. The thing is, when you do harvest, keep all of those seeds very well labeled
[53:29.680 --> 53:34.400]  and be honest with everybody about the work that you did. People that are growing the seeds that
[53:34.400 --> 53:39.760]  you create deserve to know exactly what they're getting. All right, that's enough talk about
[53:39.760 --> 53:44.720]  selection. I feel like I got you through choosing your males and choosing your females. Now let's
[53:44.720 --> 53:49.440]  talk a little bit about timing your breeding project. Let's talk about the male pollen drop
[53:49.440 --> 53:56.080]  and the female ovulation times. Male plants like to drop their pollen sometime between day 14 and
[53:56.080 --> 54:02.240]  day 21. It could start a little bit earlier. I have never seen it start earlier than day 12 or 13, but
[54:02.240 --> 54:08.080]  around day 12 or 13, usually 14 or 15, those male pollen sacs are going to open up and pollen is
[54:08.080 --> 54:13.520]  going to start coming out of those male plants. I've never seen it start any later than day 21.
[54:13.520 --> 54:21.120]  It rarely takes that long. Female plants are able to receive pollen as soon as they have pistils.
[54:21.120 --> 54:24.640]  As soon as you see those little white hairs sticking up out of your female plants, they are
[54:24.640 --> 54:31.760]  able to receive pollen. However, the ideal time for them to receive pollen is not until around day 25
[54:31.760 --> 54:38.320]  to 32. If they received pollen too early, you're not going to get a lot of seeds. If you pollinate
[54:38.320 --> 54:42.800]  too early, your plants are really little. There's not a lot of space for a seed to develop. There are
[54:42.800 --> 54:48.720]  not a lot of bud sites, so you just don't have as many seeds. If you wait too long, your calyx pistils
[54:48.720 --> 54:54.400]  miss their prime. The plants are no longer ready to breed and you will not make as many seeds as
[54:54.400 --> 55:01.360]  you wish you would have. If you hit the pollen onto the females between days 25 and 32, you will get
[55:01.440 --> 55:09.120]  the most out of your pollination. Okay, now here is a big part of breeding. The timing of breeding is
[55:09.120 --> 55:14.960]  a huge challenge. Your male plants are going to start dropping their pollen around day 15. Your
[55:14.960 --> 55:22.080]  female plants are not ready for pollen until around day 25 to 32. So the trick is you need to keep
[55:22.080 --> 55:29.200]  that male plant away from your female plants for about 10 days. If you start them at the same time,
[55:29.200 --> 55:34.160]  you got to keep them apart for about 10 days or you're not going to get as many seeds as you want.
[55:34.720 --> 55:39.440]  So there are a few ways to do this. You can either keep your male in another area to where the pollen
[55:39.440 --> 55:45.600]  can't get to the females. You can start your females a little bit early. You can start flowering
[55:45.600 --> 55:50.400]  your females 10 days before your males. That way they're 10 days ahead. That way when the male
[55:50.400 --> 55:55.040]  starts dropping pollen, you can just, they'll be timed up. You can get the females 10 days ahead.
[55:55.680 --> 56:02.320]  They'll be 25 days into flower when your male is 15 days into flower. That'll give you a week window
[56:02.320 --> 56:07.600]  to get the pollen onto the plants and hopefully you can time it up perfectly. Hopefully you ran
[56:07.600 --> 56:11.680]  your male plant at least one time before you bred with him and you know how long it's going to take
[56:11.680 --> 56:16.400]  for him to start dropping pollen and it makes this math equation a little bit easier. You need him to
[56:16.400 --> 56:23.280]  be dropping pollen when your plants are 25 to 32 days into flower. Another thing you can do is you
[56:23.280 --> 56:29.120]  can collect the pollen in a jar and you can apply it to the plants at the perfect time. One good
[56:29.120 --> 56:33.200]  thing about having the pollen in a jar is that if you are running a normal crop that you don't want
[56:33.200 --> 56:38.560]  to seed everything, you can pull one plant aside. You can take it to another area and you can just
[56:38.560 --> 56:43.600]  use a q-tip and dip that q-tip into the pollen and you can apply it to a couple of bud sites that you
[56:43.600 --> 56:49.120]  want to pollinate. Mark that branch so that you know it got pollinated. Let it soak. Let the,
[56:49.120 --> 56:53.600]  let that plant sit for a little while. Let that pollen soak in. Let it do what it needs to do.
[56:53.600 --> 56:58.240]  Then get a sprayer and spray that plant off with water and it will deactivate all of the
[56:58.240 --> 57:02.960]  loose pollen. Then go to your grow room and spray, hopefully you cleaned your clothes too,
[57:02.960 --> 57:07.280]  go to your grow room and spray all of those plants with water before you return that plant to the
[57:07.280 --> 57:12.560]  grow room and you should be able to make just a few seeds for yourself if you're very careful.
[57:12.560 --> 57:16.960]  You must be very careful and you'll get better at this as time goes on, but it's an idea. If you've
[57:16.960 --> 57:21.840]  got that jar of pollen sitting there, the options are endless. You can pollinate one plant. You can
[57:21.840 --> 57:28.160]  pollinate the entire crop. I've always got a jar of pollen on hand. So let's talk about pollination
[57:28.160 --> 57:33.120]  you guys. There are a couple of really easy ways to pollinate your plants. You have a male plant
[57:33.120 --> 57:37.520]  that is dropping pollen and you've got female plants that are ready for pollen. You can either
[57:37.520 --> 57:42.880]  take the male plant right into the grow where the females are and give it a nice shake and just
[57:42.880 --> 57:47.600]  watch that cloud of dust come out of it. All of that pollen is now airborne. It's going to land
[57:47.600 --> 57:54.160]  on your females. Every piece of pollen that touches a pistil will now be absorbed. It'll become a seed.
[57:54.160 --> 57:59.840]  You have just pollinated your plants. You can set that male plant in front of a fan and just turn
[57:59.840 --> 58:06.400]  the fan on and watch it blow pollen all over your female plants. You can cut the plant down and carry
[58:06.400 --> 58:12.160]  it into the room and you can actually smack it up against the female plants if you want. I have done
[58:12.240 --> 58:19.280]  and seen this done and it works. Last time I had my male plant way too big. The last time I did a
[58:19.280 --> 58:23.120]  breeding project there was no moving it because if I would have moved it pollen would have gone
[58:23.120 --> 58:28.560]  everywhere. I did not want to waste that much pollen. I had a small area of females. I walked
[58:28.560 --> 58:33.760]  over to the male plant and I cut a branch off of the male plant. When I cut it a little bit of
[58:33.760 --> 58:38.960]  pollen came out because of the scissor click. I held the branch. I gave it a cut and I walked that
[58:38.960 --> 58:44.160]  branch over to the females and I held it just a couple of inches above the female plants and I
[58:44.160 --> 58:48.960]  gave it a nice shake and you could just see the cloud of pollen come out. I gave it another shake
[58:48.960 --> 58:54.720]  and then I flicked it just you know just a flick just like that and tons of pollen came out. It
[58:54.720 --> 59:00.800]  probably took one medium-sized branch to pollinate an entire light worth of plants. Of course I used
[59:00.800 --> 59:05.840]  two or three branches because I wanted to make sure to get enough pollen in there. So you can
[59:05.840 --> 59:11.040]  either move the male plant to the room and leave it alive and give it a shake and let it pollinate
[59:11.040 --> 59:15.520]  naturally. You can put a fan in front of it and blow it around. I've actually seen guys hit the
[59:15.520 --> 59:19.840]  fan with the male plant so that way it hits it it just fucking explodes pollen everywhere.
[59:20.880 --> 59:25.920]  You can cut a branch off and carry the branch to the room. Also another thing that you can do if
[59:25.920 --> 59:29.760]  you've got a jar of stored pollen and I'm going to teach you how to store pollen next. If you've got
[59:29.760 --> 59:36.000]  a jar of stored pollen all you've got to do is take that stored pollen and I just stick my hand
[59:36.000 --> 59:40.640]  my gloved hand into the jar of pollen. I've got a rubber glove on I just put the hand right in there
[59:40.640 --> 59:45.040]  and now my glove has pollen stuck to it and I'll just go and kind of sprinkle above the plants and
[59:45.040 --> 59:50.240]  just touch the plants and they will get pollinated by that. You can put some in your hand and blow it
[59:50.240 --> 59:56.240]  if you want. All you need to do is get that fancy dust that fairy dust that pixie dust all over the
[59:56.240 --> 01:00:01.680]  pistils of your girl plants and they are now pollinated. You know the plants are pollinated
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:07.680]  because when that pollen touches it will take very few minutes but the white hairs that you guys talk
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:13.120]  about the pistils everyone calls them hairs the pistils will start to curl up and turn brown.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:17.680]  That's how you know they've been used. They are now pollinated. They'll start to shrivel up and
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.000]  get weird. Sometimes the leaves will do funky things when the plants get pollinated. It's all
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.440]  plant specific but you'll definitely see the pistils get brown and curved and withered and
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:34.800]  they'll look like they expired. Nothing's wrong that is exactly what you want. So let's see those
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:42.000]  seeds are going to take about 40 to 50 days to get ready from pollination. So if you pollinate on day
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:50.320]  25 around day 65 to 75 your seeds will be ready. Grow it just like normal. Keep feeding it like
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.040]  you normally do. Don't give it as much booster as I talked about that earlier. Still flush because
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.520]  there's going to be material that will be turned into hash. We'll talk about harvesting your seeds.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:05.920]  I should talk about collecting and storing pollen before we get to harvesting your seeds.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:13.840]  Pollen collection is very easy. You've got that male plant it's growing. You can either set a
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:18.720]  plate just a white dinner plate underneath your plant as long as you don't have any fans blowing
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:23.680]  or blowers blowing it around the pollen will fall directly out of the plant. Gravity will take it
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:30.000]  right down and it'll gather on that plate. You can use a mirror. I used an old drum head one time.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.800]  I'm a drummer. I put a 22 inch kick drum head underneath my male plant and all the pollen that
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.600]  fell landed inside the kick drum head. So once you've got all that pollen gathered do not let
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.720]  it get wet. If water touches that pollen it's fucked it's over it's useless. Once the pollen
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:51.760]  falls onto the plate or the drum head or whatever it lands on to I used my ID or a credit card and
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:57.360]  I just scoop it up into a nice little pile and then I let it dry. You need the pollen to get
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.320]  completely dry. If there are little male flowers that fall in there when you're collecting the
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:06.400]  pollen pick those out because they have moisture and they'll fuck up your pollen. They will make
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:12.240]  that pollen inactive. It'll get funky it'll get chunky it won't be any good. So if you're patient
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.800]  and you've got the room and the time just put something underneath your male plant and let it
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.880]  drop pollen and then you can collect it that way naturally. If you don't have the space and you're
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:27.200]  not that patient or maybe you want to get more pollen more quickly an easy thing to do is I like
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:33.520]  to cut the branch off the plant and then I hold it over the plate and I just tap it with my finger
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:39.120]  right directly onto the plate and then you get a lot of pollen just falls. You can use a mirror.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.320]  You can use a Tupperware dish something glass is ideal because this it doesn't stick as well and
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:50.080]  it doesn't get static. So if you've got like a mirror or a big dinner plate or a sushi plate
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:56.880]  is ideal. Cut the branch off hold it over the sushi plate in a room with no wind and away from
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:02.480]  all your female plants just tap. I use tap tech is what I call it just tap that that that pollen
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:07.200]  right out of the branch just tap it right onto the plate right onto the mirror and just let it dry
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:13.520]  and then scoop it up and put it into a glass jar. It is a good idea to put a silicate package in
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:19.920]  there not a bovida pack. You do not want to keep it humid. You want a silicate pack that will dry
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:26.320]  it out. You want it as dry as it can get. Pull all the male flowers out get it in a jar and let it get
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:33.520]  completely dry and then if you want to store that pollen just put it in a cool dry dark place. A lot
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:38.080]  of people like to put it in the refrigerator. I do not do that. I've got a filing cabinet that is
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:43.520]  in a basement. I just put it in there. It stays in the back of the filing cabinet. It's cool it's dry
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:48.880]  and it's dark and that pollen stays good for a long time. I have used that pollen six months after
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:55.040]  I've stored it and it has been completely viable. Another good way to catch pollen is a pollen
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.240]  collection bag. My friends at Hort Solutions on Instagram sent me these bags. I don't know what
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:05.280]  this material is made out of. It's a thick paper. It is almost like a filter. It feels like a filter
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.880]  for maybe a thick coffee filter but they made a bag out of it and it's got a little clear plastic
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:17.920]  window in it so you can see inside. What this bag is for you slide it over. This would probably fit
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.120]  if you grew a small male plant. You could almost fit the entire male plant in there if you trimmed
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.400]  off the lower branches and just use that one main cola. You could fit an entire plant or a large
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:33.360]  branch in there. That would probably be the top cola of one of my plants. It would fit right inside
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:38.560]  there. Then you seal it at the bottom with either some tape or a rubber band. When it starts to
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:43.840]  pollinate, the pollen cannot get out of the bag but the air can flow through the bag so that the
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:49.120]  plants will live. They don't die because they're still getting light and air. When the plant starts
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.280]  to drop its pollen, you can watch the pollen come out and the pollen doesn't go anywhere. It stays
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:58.320]  right inside the bag. Once you feel like you've got enough pollen or that plant has expired and
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:04.080]  it's going to quit making pollen, you can cut the branch and then open the bag up and take the bud
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:08.400]  out or the branch or the plant. Take that out. Give it a good shake before you take it out.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:14.160]  Then all of your pollen will be contained inside that bag. You can pour that into a jar or
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:18.480]  whatever type of container you're going to keep it in. Then pull out the male flowers. Get your
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:24.800]  silicate pack in there. Now you have got pollen that you gathered on your own in a bag. Also,
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:30.880]  this bag works in reverse. If you want to pollinate one branch of a plant, you have that
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:34.720]  jar of pollen. You take your plant like I talked about earlier. Take it to a safe place with no
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:40.560]  wind. Use a Q-tip or a paintbrush. Dip it into your jar of pollen. Paint that onto a bud. Then
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:46.160]  you put this bag over it. Then that will prevent that pollen from getting into the rest of your
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:51.760]  grow room. It works as a catch or as a pollen condom. It's a great device. If you guys are
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:55.760]  interested in one, they do not pay me to say this. I just think it's a great product. I am
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:03.280]  checking to make sure I give you the right web address. It is www.hort-solutions.com. That's
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:08.880]  hort-solutions.com. If you want to follow them on Instagram, it's hort-solutions. It's a great
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.840]  product, great way to catch pollen. All right. That is how you collect your pollen. Storing
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:19.520]  pollen, I told you how to do that. Just keep it in a cool, dry, dark place. Now let's talk about
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:23.680]  harvesting your seeds. You guys, I've been going for an hour and six minutes. Honestly, my voice
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:28.960]  is starting to get tired. I'm going to start going a little more quickly. Harvesting seeds is very
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:35.520]  easy. Just like any other harvest, about 14 days before you begin harvesting, start flushing your
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:41.280]  plants. All you have to do is feed your plants clean pH balanced water for the last 10 to 14
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:46.800]  days of your flowering cycle. Your plants, your buds will taste much better when you smoke it.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:50.720]  Yes, I know we're growing seeds right now, but there is going to be material left over.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:55.040]  You may want to roll a joint. You may want to turn it into extracts. You may want to make edibles out
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:07:00.640]  of it. So please do flush it. Flushing is free. I don't know why people don't flush. It's 14 days
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:05.680]  that you don't have to use nutrients. Water is going into the plants anyway. It's fucking flush.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:10.720]  I don't get why people don't do that. So 14 days before harvest, start flushing. Two or three days
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:15.120]  before you chop down the plants, go in the grow room and pull off all of the large leaves. Any
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:19.120]  big leave with the petiole, any leave that's in the way, go ahead and take it off. The plants are
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:24.800]  going to get harvested. They do not leave. They do not need those leaves. So at harvest time,
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:30.480]  here is how I do it. This is what works for me. I like to chop down the entire plant. I like to hang
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:36.240]  that plant upside down. I put a label on it so I know exactly what plant that is. I'll write the
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:42.800]  date on it so I know what day I chopped it down. I like to let the plants hang upside down until
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:47.440]  they are crispy dry. You guys were pulling seeds out of here. We're not going to dry and cure this
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:53.760]  bud. Let it get crispy dry. Sometimes if you let it get too dry, seeds will start falling out of it.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:58.880]  So what I like to do is put something underneath each plant. I leave them far enough apart to where
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:04.800]  if I've got strain A and strain B and seeds fall out, I know that those seeds are not going to mix.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:11.280]  I'll put a drum head or a box or some sort of catch container underneath the plants to catch any
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.880]  stray seeds that fall out. Sometimes I don't even care about the stray seeds that fall out because
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:19.600]  I have so many that I don't even worry about it. I sweep them up and they go in the trash. Sometimes
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:25.280]  they get given away as mystery seeds to friends. But hang the plants upside down. Let them dry. Let
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:30.400]  them get crispy. Once the plants get nice and dry and crispy, I cut them into sections that are more
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:36.560]  manageable and I put them in a long Tupperware container and I just let them dry even further.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:42.160]  If I've got a whole bunch of strain A, I will put all of strain A into one container if it fits
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:46.960]  and then I put on some rubber gloves and honestly I just start mushing up the buds with my fingers
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.520]  and it just starts crumbling. It just starts falling apart and you can just hear the seeds
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:57.360]  come raining out. The seeds just come falling out of the buds if you did it correctly. So cut down
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:02.400]  the plants. Let them dry until they're crispy. Cut them into manageable sections. Put them in a
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:06.880]  container. Either a pie plate, a Tupperware container, some sort of thing that when the
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.520]  seeds fall out it's not going to roll away. Start crushing it up. Wear some gloves. Crush it up.
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.280]  You're going to hear the seeds come out. Now you're going to have little stems. You're going to have
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:20.480]  dried bud material and you're going to have seeds. You can throw all the stems away. Put all the
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:25.120]  seeds in a jar and then you've got a bunch of bud material that you can either make edibles out of.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:31.440]  You can give it to a friend. You can extract it. You can smoke it. I personally like to make hash
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:36.320]  with my material that comes from my seeded plants because I think something happens to the plant
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.320]  when it gets seeded and the oil that comes from it. I like to make BHO. The hash oil that comes
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:46.560]  from it seems to get me a little bit better of a high, a different high. It feels like it does
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:51.360]  something that normal hash doesn't do when it's made from plants that were not seeded. That's
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.240]  just my opinion. So that's how you harvest your seeds. Basically cut down the plants. Let them dry.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:01.040]  Put it over a container and crumble the seeds out. Hopefully you get a bunch of seeds. Hopefully
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:06.400]  you have big round tiger stripe seeds. Something that I like to do that you may want to do
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.880]  when you think the seeds are getting close to ready, you'll be able to see them in the buds.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:17.120]  There's nothing wrong with going to a lower part of the plant and popping out one seed every now
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.520]  and then and investigating it until you think it's ready. It's better to ruin one or two seeds than
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:27.920]  cut down the whole plant early and ruin everything. So about 30 days after pollination, I'll go in
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:32.560]  and pull out one of the seeds. It's probably going to be white. It's probably going to be small.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:37.680]  It's probably not going to be ready. But now I've got an indicator of where I am. I want to wait
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:42.320]  until the seeds that I pull out are hard. You want to be able to put it on a table. I'm sitting at a
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:47.200]  wooden table. That's a wooden table. I want to set the seed on this table and push with my finger as
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.400]  hard as I can. I don't want that seed to crack. That's how I know they're ready. Don't push as
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.840]  hard as you can. You guys don't hurt yourself. But you want to be able to push nice and hard
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:00.880]  on that seed. You don't want them to crack. If they're white, if they're soft, they're not ready.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:06.000]  You want big, fat, fluffy tiger stripe seeds. Some seeds that I make do not ever get a tiger
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.720]  stripe. They turn this gray color. They are ready. Not all seeds are going to get a tiger stripe.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.640]  What else do I need to talk about, you guys? The people that asked for a long podcast,
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.960]  you're welcome. I'm an hour and 11 minutes in and I have still got a little bit of material.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.080]  I want to thank you guys for listening to this long episode. I know I'm starting to get rambly.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.040]  I'm starting to get tired. My voice is wearing out. I'm going to keep going.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.800]  Storing seeds is very easy. I just keep my seeds in a mason jar. I keep them sealed and I keep them
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:36.560]  in a cool, dry, dark place. They're actually in a very similar place to where I keep my pollen.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.080]  Now you've got a bunch of seeds. The next thing to do is to grow them out. One thing I want to
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:49.600]  mention is please do not sell untested seeds. That's fucked up. Don't do that. If you make
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:54.800]  some seeds, grow them. Germinate them. Write down how many you started. Write down the germination
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:59.680]  rate. If you don't get at least a 70% germination rate, try two or three times. If you don't get
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:04.240]  at least a 70% germination rate, something's wrong with the seeds. They do not need to be sold.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:11.040]  Don't sell untested seeds. Flower them all the way to the end. If they are hermaphrodites,
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:15.760]  don't sell them. If they are not quality seeds that make quality plants, do not sell them.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.400]  If 7 out of 10 of those plants that come out of there are not something you would be proud of
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:25.920]  smoking and be proud of posting a picture of all over Instagram, do not put that seed line out.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:30.880]  There are better seeds out there. You can throw seeds away. It is okay. You can grow them yourself
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.280]  if you want to. That is fine. But please do not put them in the hands of unsuspecting growers.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:41.040]  You can give your seeds away to your friends. If you tell them, hey dude, I haven't tested this.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.360]  Hey dude, I'm not sure what this is going to do. You can give those away, but please do not try to
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.840]  make any money off of untested seeds. Don't mislead people with what you're giving them.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:56.080]  That is wrong. Also, if you, like I said a minute ago, it's okay to toss something.
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:01.920]  If you make a cross, if you take pollen and put it on this plant and you make a bunch of seeds and
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:07.920]  you grow a hundred of those seeds and they are not way improved on what you started with, if the buds
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:11.840]  that come out of that are not better than the buds that came from the original female plant,
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.600]  you did not do any justice to that breeding project. You need to get rid of it.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:23.280]  Don't, don't make seed. Don't keep seeds just out of pride. Don't be prideful. Don't be arrogant.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:27.520]  Get rid of some shit that is not contributing to making cannabis a better plant. That's not
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:33.200]  what we're here for. Don't be afraid to toss bad stuff. If you're wasting time growing shitty seeds,
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:38.240]  you are cock blocking yourself from growing good seeds. You could throw away that bad shit. You
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:42.400]  could plant more. You might find fire. That's something that I really wanted to talk about.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:46.400]  All right. So you've got a bunch of seeds that you made yourself. The next step is to grow them
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.640]  and find out what you made. That's always the funnest part right there. So plant a bunch of
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:55.520]  seeds. See what comes from it. See if you made a whole bunch of freaks. See if you just made the
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:14:00.000]  next chem dog. You never know what you could have made until you grow it. So grow it out.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.360]  See what you've got. If you're just making seeds for yourself, you can stop or you can keep going.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:10.400]  The next step would be to make an F2, which would be to find a male and a female that have the
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:16.160]  perfect traits and breed them together. And then you'll make more seeds. Those seeds are called F2.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:20.160]  You'll find the perfect male and the perfect female out of those. Breed those together again.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:24.480]  Those will be your F3s. The seeds that come out of there will be the F3. The idea then is to keep
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:30.720]  going all the way to F5. And once you get to F5, every seed that you crack will come out looking
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:35.440]  like a clone of the other one. You'll have exactly what you want nailed down. Of course,
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.720]  if you're just making these seeds for your own personal garden, you can stop right here where
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.800]  you are with this original cross and you can have fun growing that. And then you can cross those
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:49.040]  seeds to more and you can cross those to other things. But the options are endless once you get
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:53.280]  this far. All right. I think I've got one more part to talk about. I'm going to press pause and
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.680]  take a dab in a drink. And when I get back, I'm going to talk about keeping male plants. And then
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:04.400]  we're going to wrap up this podcast. Okay. I'm back. Let's do a quick talk about keeping
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:10.160]  male plants around. I keep male plants just like I keep a female mother plant. I like to keep it
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:16.560]  in a semi-large pot, a five gallon or bigger. If you can keep it in an air pot or a root pot,
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:21.360]  that is ideal. The reason for that is to keep the plant from getting root bound. And I feel like the
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.080]  root pots kind of do a little bit of root pruning for me. So the plants won't get root bound because
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:31.040]  when they do get root bound, you'll start seeing stress problems. And some plants like to try to
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:37.600]  auto flower if they do get root bound. So I like a big pot. I like a nicely aerated soil or a
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:43.840]  soilless mix. Maybe mix a little bit of cocoa in there. It's ideal to keep your mother or father
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.280]  plants. This is a father plant is what I would call this. It's ideal to keep your mother and
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:53.680]  father plants under either 18, six or 24 hours of continuous light. One thing that I have shifted to
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:16:01.200]  that I learned from DJ Short, I run a 19-5 cycle for my mother and father plants. I feel like 19
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:07.520]  hours on gives them plenty of time for growth. And the five hours off gives everything time to rest.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:11.760]  I think everybody wants time to sleep. The plants want to sleep and also my equipment needs some
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:18.000]  rest. So I think the five hour break is good for everything. I like the shorter rest period because
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.400]  that way I know that none of my plants are going to decide that they're going to try to flower.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:26.240]  And then I get to keep my mother plants and father plants forever. Because if you do keep a
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:30.640]  plant for a long time, if it's around for a long time, the hormones move around. Sometimes it'll
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.760]  get old and it will try to flower on you if you give it some darkness. Sometimes plants will try
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:41.840]  to auto flower on you if they get root bound. So I try to keep them under the 19 hours on,
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:47.520]  five hours off. You can do 18, six or you can do 24 hours on. All three of these options will work
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:52.560]  just depending on the strain that you've got and what your goal is. So I like to keep it in a large
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:58.800]  pot, good soil, keep it on a vegetative light cycle. And then something that I like to do is I
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.960]  take a lot of clones from it and I like to prune it very often. And I also keep a backup of my male
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:09.360]  plants somewhere else in a totally different location. So that if something does go wrong
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.760]  with King Solomon at the A location, there is a clone of King Solomon at the B location just
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:21.040]  because he's my prize male. So as long as you keep your plant in a large pot with good soil,
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:26.000]  under a vegetative light, it should continue to veg indefinitely. You should be able to take clones
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:32.640]  off it forever. I would feed my mother and father plants just basic vegetative nutrients, give them
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:37.840]  grow A and grow B or whatever grow nutrients you're using, maybe a little cow mag occasionally.
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:44.240]  And I like to feed them kelp products. And before I take clones, between 12 and 24 hours before
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:50.480]  cutting clones, I like to spray my plants with a kelp product, maybe liquid karma or something like
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:56.240]  that. But mix up some liquid karma, adjust the pH and foliar spray your mother or father plants
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:01.200]  before taking clones is some great advice. The email that I read at the start of the show actually
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:06.400]  said that the listener keeps their mother plants in two gallon pots and keeps them about two feet
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:11.360]  tall and does some root pruning. So I'm hoping that we get a reply from them and they are going
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:17.040]  to teach us how to do that. And I will teach you guys how to do that in a future episode.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, my throat and my voice are burnt out. So it is time for me to wrap up the
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:26.720]  show. Before I go, I want to tell you about a service called Patreon. Patreon is a service
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.280]  that will allow my listeners to make a financial contribution to the podcast.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:35.600]  I'm not trying to get rich off this podcast. I'm not asking anybody to pay for the podcast.
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:40.320]  This podcast will always be free because it comes from my heart and I want everybody that listens to
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:46.160]  grow better cannabis. But if you feel like this episode was worth a dollar or two dollars, or
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:49.680]  however much you feel like it was worth, if you would like to make a contribution, all you have
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:55.440]  to do is go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart, make yourself a little Patreon account,
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.280]  type in the dollar amount that you would like to contribute. You can contribute as little as
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:03.440]  one dollar and I honestly don't think there is a limit on how many zeros you type in.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.720]  I would be grateful for a one dollar contribution. What I'm going to do with that dollar,
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:14.320]  I am going to continue to keep my website, iRegeneticsColorado.com alive. That website is
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:21.280]  where I host this podcast. I pay for that website myself out of my pocket every year. It is $315
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:26.480]  annually. I would just like your help to offset the cost of my website to keep this podcast coming
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:32.560]  to you for free. I'll never ask anybody to pay for the show, but if you feel like you can contribute,
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:38.640]  I would appreciate your contribution. Once again, it is patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
