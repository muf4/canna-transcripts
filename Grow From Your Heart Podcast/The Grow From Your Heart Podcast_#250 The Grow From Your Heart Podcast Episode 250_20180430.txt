[00:15.230 --> 00:17.830]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:17.830 --> 00:21.350]  It's time for episode number 250 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.750 --> 00:25.670]  You're a source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:25.670 --> 00:27.590]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.630 --> 00:29.710]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:29.990 --> 00:33.070]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:33.070 --> 00:37.030]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:37.550 --> 00:39.350]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.390 --> 00:41.830]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:41.870 --> 00:44.750]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:44.750 --> 00:48.150]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat,
[00:48.630 --> 00:51.510]  Koot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.390 --> 00:55.910]  Ladies and gentlemen, across the table from me, covered in sweat,
[00:55.910 --> 00:58.830]  bright red eye putting on his headphones and recovering from a giant dab.
[00:58.830 --> 01:03.230]  It's white Mike. Welcome to the show, bro. Hey man. Thanks for joining me.
[01:03.750 --> 01:05.950]  Yeah, man. Yeah. You just spend too long.
[01:05.990 --> 01:10.430]  You just took a choker of a dab over there. I, uh, I I'd be dying right now,
[01:10.430 --> 01:12.190]  but I low tempted a little too far.
[01:12.550 --> 01:14.790]  That's that's perfect. Cause I didn't need you dying through the intro of the
[01:14.790 --> 01:18.190]  show. I'm not used to that double bucket of yours. Oh, the, uh,
[01:18.190 --> 01:20.790]  the thermal banger. Yeah. I'm not used to the thermal banger.
[01:20.790 --> 01:23.550]  Had I cooked my regular banger that long,
[01:23.590 --> 01:26.470]  I would have taken a ridiculously hot dab and I'd be dead. Yes.
[01:26.510 --> 01:27.870]  It does take a little extra heat,
[01:27.870 --> 01:31.150]  but the dab you get off of the thermal banger with, with the bubble cap,
[01:31.150 --> 01:33.190]  without the bubble cap, that thing's useless, right?
[01:33.230 --> 01:37.470]  Thermal banger bubble cap wrecks you. Oh, such a great, great dab.
[01:37.510 --> 01:39.430]  Welcome to the show, brother. Yeah. You took a nice, uh,
[01:39.470 --> 01:40.310]  what are you dabbing over there?
[01:40.510 --> 01:43.750]  That was some massive cherries from, uh, um,
[01:43.750 --> 01:47.190]  our material out at three rivers and, uh, processed by CSC.
[01:47.270 --> 01:52.230]  So it's the critical mass and the, uh, the black cherry ran together.
[01:52.270 --> 01:55.070]  It tastes delicious. Thanks for the dab you gave me. So good. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:55.070 --> 01:59.110]  That's good stuff. Uh, good, good job to our friends over at CSC.
[01:59.110 --> 02:01.670]  I like to start the show you always by letting people know what I'm smoking on.
[02:01.670 --> 02:03.990]  So today we're smoking on the massive cherry. Uh,
[02:03.990 --> 02:08.070]  we're also going to take some dabs of some platinum tangy here in a minute. Uh,
[02:08.070 --> 02:11.390]  we will also smoke some star dog, pHO wax. We've got a whole bunch of good stuff.
[02:13.230 --> 02:16.110]  Yes, we do. It's going to be a fun party for some reason. I'm feeling a little,
[02:16.110 --> 02:18.310]  a, I don't feel a hundred percent super good today.
[02:18.310 --> 02:19.830]  You've got a headache and I've got the sniffles.
[02:19.830 --> 02:22.950]  This is going to be a fun like a weird migraine thing happening.
[02:22.950 --> 02:26.190]  And I tried to try to have some water and some snacks and I shook most of it.
[02:26.270 --> 02:29.470]  The dabs kind of made it go away, but yeah, I haven't felt a hundred percent today,
[02:29.470 --> 02:30.870]  but we're going to do a podcast through it.
[02:30.870 --> 02:34.030]  Buddy dab right through it. As soon as I noticed when, uh,
[02:34.630 --> 02:36.230]  as a musician, I noticed something.
[02:36.510 --> 02:40.590]  You can feel like shit or you can be too intoxicated or you could just be having a
[02:40.590 --> 02:43.430]  problem. But as soon as you get your instrument going and the music starts
[02:43.430 --> 02:45.070]  playing, all that shit disappears.
[02:45.070 --> 02:48.670]  And when I hit play and heard the intro music, I noticed when I went, yeah,
[02:48.670 --> 02:51.910]  I was like, Oh, my headache just kind of faded away for a minute. So yeah,
[02:51.950 --> 02:53.510]  all that good stuff will make it go away.
[02:53.630 --> 02:56.670]  Episode two 50 like this is almost muscle memory.
[02:57.190 --> 03:00.110]  Well, yeah, but at the same time I'm not phoning it in.
[03:00.350 --> 03:02.030]  No, no, no. That's not what I'm getting at.
[03:02.030 --> 03:05.190]  But like it's something that you do mainly out of love. So yes,
[03:05.190 --> 03:09.070]  as soon as you start doing it, your body remembers why, how much you enjoy it.
[03:09.110 --> 03:11.270]  You're at the podcast table. We know how to do this.
[03:11.310 --> 03:14.590]  Throw some dopamine and a little adrenaline at you to get you through. Yes.
[03:14.630 --> 03:17.910]  Yes. Um, so how do we want to start episode two 50? I want to start,
[03:17.910 --> 03:18.750]  I just wrote a note on my hand.
[03:18.750 --> 03:21.110]  I've got a whole list of notes and then I wrote one more note on my hand.
[03:21.390 --> 03:24.030]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is episode number two 50. Welcome to the podcast.
[03:24.030 --> 03:25.750]  If this is your first podcast,
[03:25.750 --> 03:28.430]  if this is your first episode of the grow from your heart podcast you've ever
[03:28.430 --> 03:29.190]  listened to,
[03:29.190 --> 03:32.870]  or if this is the 250th episode of the grow from your heart podcast you've ever
[03:32.870 --> 03:36.350]  listened to, welcome to the show and thank each and every one of you for
[03:36.350 --> 03:39.950]  listening. I am. Thank you so much. I'm stoked to have made it this far.
[03:40.430 --> 03:42.950]  It's huge. Do what you said. It was going to be episode two 50.
[03:42.950 --> 03:45.550]  I was like, I don't care what I have to do. I have to be on that show.
[03:45.630 --> 03:47.270]  I think you were on the first episode, weren't you?
[03:47.750 --> 03:49.190]  Oh no.
[03:49.310 --> 03:50.870]  You were not on number one. It was Kevin.
[03:51.150 --> 03:53.870]  Kevin was on number one. I'm pretty sure I was on number two.
[03:53.870 --> 03:55.710]  Adam wasn't around quite yet.
[03:56.910 --> 03:59.150]  All right. I think Adam came just a little bit later.
[03:59.150 --> 04:02.030]  My timeline's a little fuzzy since the head injury, some stuff.
[04:02.030 --> 04:03.950]  I remember it, but Dan, all the pieces.
[04:03.950 --> 04:07.230]  I've got 50 or so hours of show on top of that in my head,
[04:07.230 --> 04:09.790]  just from going back to listening to old stuff again on Thursdays.
[04:09.830 --> 04:13.710]  How many episodes do you think you've been on? Oh God, a lot. Maybe a lot.
[04:13.750 --> 04:19.030]  Okay. Nice. Nice. Um, let's see. We're recording on 10, seven, 17.
[04:19.070 --> 04:21.430]  I just want to mention that for archive purposes.
[04:21.430 --> 04:23.990]  I don't know why I wrote that down, but I want to, I want to,
[04:24.030 --> 04:26.470]  I want to mention that. What date? 10 said, well, you know what?
[04:26.470 --> 04:29.350]  I wrote that down on 10, seven and it's 10, nine. I think let me pull up.
[04:30.150 --> 04:32.110]  Holy shit. Well, I made these notes a couple of days ago.
[04:32.190 --> 04:35.270]  I wrote a lot of notes today. I wrote the date a lot of times today.
[04:35.270 --> 04:38.150]  It's definitely 10, 10, the look on Mike's face. When I said 10, seven,
[04:38.150 --> 04:41.630]  he's like, Oh fuck, what happened? I heard 10, 17. And I was like, no,
[04:41.630 --> 04:46.030]  it's the fuck not like, don't be taking a whole week away from me.
[04:46.230 --> 04:48.550]  No, we got a harvest too soon. Like, yeah,
[04:48.550 --> 04:50.710]  I can't have three harvests in that room.
[04:50.870 --> 04:55.910]  I hate to start a podcast with sad news, but uh, man, uh, we lost a rough week.
[04:55.950 --> 04:59.470]  We lost one of the greats, uh, Mr. Ralphie may,
[04:59.870 --> 05:02.830]  one of the best comedians on the planet. In my opinion, uh,
[05:02.830 --> 05:06.190]  Ralphie may past of cardiac arrest. Ralphie may had been, uh,
[05:06.230 --> 05:10.390]  struggling with pneumonia. If you know Ralphie may, he was also quite large.
[05:10.710 --> 05:13.990]  He had been cleaning up his act. He was eating better. He was off drugs.
[05:13.990 --> 05:15.150]  All he did was smoke weed.
[05:15.390 --> 05:18.270]  He hung out with Joey Diaz and did comedy shows in Las Vegas.
[05:18.270 --> 05:21.510]  He was a resident comedian in Vegas and they found him dead. Uh,
[05:21.550 --> 05:25.630]  shout out to Ralphie may. I did get to see Ralphie at comedy work South,
[05:25.630 --> 05:27.150]  not the small downtown club.
[05:27.670 --> 05:32.430]  I think my first comedy works experience was either Doug Benson or Ralphie may.
[05:32.470 --> 05:36.710]  I not sure which one happened first, but a Ralphie may was a great show.
[05:36.910 --> 05:41.510]  There was a heckler in that show and I have never seen a comedian fucking
[05:41.510 --> 05:46.270]  destroy a heckler like that. Ralphie may must've planned. He,
[05:46.350 --> 05:47.190]  I was like,
[05:47.910 --> 05:50.630]  when you get to his status, you've got a few in your pocket, right?
[05:51.270 --> 05:56.190]  Anybody who messes with your show, he, he crushed that fucking heckler,
[05:56.230 --> 05:59.030]  rolled them up into a little ball, rolled them down the bowling lane,
[05:59.030 --> 06:02.990]  got a fucking strike and then took a breath and back to my bit now and just
[06:02.990 --> 06:05.590]  fucking crushed his act. Just like he was like he didn't, yeah,
[06:05.590 --> 06:09.110]  he didn't miss a fucking beat. Uh, Ralphie may was known as a part of your Ralphie.
[06:09.110 --> 06:11.430]  May like to eat some mushrooms and smoke a little weed.
[06:11.430 --> 06:15.430]  One of my favorite Joey Coco Diaz stories involves Ralphie may.
[06:16.070 --> 06:19.110]  Uh, I'm just going to summarize here cause it's a great story. Uh,
[06:19.270 --> 06:22.750]  and if you don't listen to anything with Joey Diaz, you should, he's offensive.
[06:22.750 --> 06:25.550]  So be forewarned. I hope you like it as much as I do. Uh,
[06:25.590 --> 06:30.470]  Joey Diaz tells a story about performing in a comedy club and a girl had
[06:30.470 --> 06:32.830]  cocaine. And if you know anything about Joey Diaz and cocaine,
[06:32.990 --> 06:34.870]  I think he was more into the cocaine than the girl.
[06:34.870 --> 06:39.030]  But this girl had some cocaine and he took her into a walk-in freezer in this
[06:39.030 --> 06:42.150]  restaurant. And he says, I was eating a monkey. Uh,
[06:42.150 --> 06:46.030]  he was putting Coke rocks in her vagina and snorting them out and they got caught
[06:46.030 --> 06:50.430]  by the manager. He was smooth enough to stick the bag of Coke. I don't, uh,
[06:50.550 --> 06:53.590]  promote drug use, but this is what Joey does. And he's a fucking adult, man.
[06:53.950 --> 06:57.550]  So Joey steals the cocaine and sticks it in his sock and dips.
[06:58.310 --> 07:00.670]  And he runs upstairs and he tells Joe Rogan, Hey Rogan,
[07:00.670 --> 07:03.310]  I just got myself in trouble. I need to get the fuck out of here.
[07:03.430 --> 07:07.310]  Joe Rogan hands him a hundred dollar bill and tells him good luck, bro. So, uh,
[07:07.310 --> 07:09.670]  Joey Diaz starts walking on the street. Like I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[07:09.670 --> 07:12.710]  I'm not sure what I'm going to do. And Ralphie may drives by or walks by.
[07:12.950 --> 07:15.670]  And he tells him Ralphie, get the car, Jack, get the car. And he's like,
[07:15.670 --> 07:18.310]  Coco, I got shit to do. And he's like, get the fucking car, Jack.
[07:18.590 --> 07:21.750]  And so finally fucking Ralphie gets the car and picks up uncle Joey and they
[07:21.750 --> 07:24.430]  drive off and fucking Ralphie may rescued uncle Joey.
[07:26.390 --> 07:29.070]  That's one of their many stories they've told together on the podcast,
[07:29.070 --> 07:29.910]  but that's a great story.
[07:29.910 --> 07:34.710]  I'm almost glad my life path never took me into their
[07:34.710 --> 07:36.670]  life paths because honestly, like,
[07:36.710 --> 07:41.310]  I think I would throw myself down that path a lot harder than is survivable.
[07:41.750 --> 07:44.590]  I got lucky. I purposefully ducked pretty much everything,
[07:44.590 --> 07:49.430]  but weed in psychedelics until I knew myself well
[07:49.430 --> 07:53.750]  enough to know that anything that picked me up and gave me a bunch more energy
[07:53.750 --> 07:55.470]  was something I needed to stay the fuck away from.
[07:55.510 --> 07:57.670]  Yeah. I don't like those kinds of feelings. Uh,
[07:57.710 --> 08:00.150]  psychedelics were my friend for quite a while. Of course,
[08:00.150 --> 08:03.470]  I went to a bunch of fish shows and I'm a dead head and I'm into that side of
[08:03.470 --> 08:06.910]  life. So I've, I've done my fair share of DMT and more than my,
[08:06.910 --> 08:09.270]  I've done your share of LSD along with mine.
[08:09.790 --> 08:10.910]  You've done everyone's share.
[08:11.510 --> 08:13.030]  Yeah. I've done a lot of people. I've, if you,
[08:13.030 --> 08:16.190]  if you've never done acid and you're not into it, I did yours for you.
[08:16.190 --> 08:19.110]  You'll be just fine. Don't worry. Somebody had that handled. Yeah.
[08:19.110 --> 08:21.630]  But that was, that was like the nineties and early two thousands and shit.
[08:21.630 --> 08:23.110]  So that's, that's way in the past.
[08:23.230 --> 08:26.390]  But I never got into like the cocaine and the other weird drugs like the
[08:26.390 --> 08:28.510]  psychedelics. I like to be fucking woo.
[08:28.830 --> 08:32.510]  And I don't feel like that. I never thought those were as a, I don't know.
[08:32.510 --> 08:35.990]  I never saw people digging through dumpsters to get a hit acid, you know?
[08:36.110 --> 08:38.710]  Right. That's not, you don't get addicted to those kinds of drugs.
[08:38.710 --> 08:41.230]  Like what are you gonna do Friday? I'm gonna eat some acid. We can do Monday.
[08:41.270 --> 08:42.950]  I'm going to be back to a normal person and go to work.
[08:44.030 --> 08:48.510]  I have to keep my job up so that my apartment can still be mine. Yeah. Yeah.
[08:48.630 --> 08:50.910]  But when you're playing in the band and they're paying you an acid,
[08:50.910 --> 08:52.630]  then it gets a little, those lines blur.
[08:53.750 --> 08:58.230]  That's one of the things that like non drug consuming people often don't realize
[08:58.230 --> 09:02.630]  is that like 98% of drug consumers, you would have no idea,
[09:02.630 --> 09:07.630]  consume drugs because they just do it occasionally recreationally.
[09:07.670 --> 09:12.670]  It's not something that drives their existence or that they promote regularly.
[09:13.910 --> 09:16.270]  Everybody's got a job. Everybody's got responsibilities.
[09:16.390 --> 09:21.390]  We've got a friend who has a name that is a name of an inanimate object and his
[09:21.470 --> 09:24.830]  name got brought up today and somebody was actually talking about the inanimate
[09:24.830 --> 09:28.110]  object and somebody was like, do you mean this guy? And I was like, not, no,
[09:28.230 --> 09:30.870]  I meant object, not person. But it's funny that you say that.
[09:30.870 --> 09:32.870]  That guy's fucking cool. And he goes, Oh, you know him?
[09:33.110 --> 09:36.590]  And they started talking about his rampant drug use. And I was like, yeah,
[09:36.590 --> 09:39.870]  that dude does a bunch of fucking drugs. But you'd never know. He goes to work.
[09:39.870 --> 09:41.950]  He's not a piece of shit drug user. Right.
[09:42.070 --> 09:44.470]  And that person had to think about their, what they were saying. Like, Hey,
[09:44.470 --> 09:47.110]  you know what? He does do every drug on the fucking planet,
[09:47.110 --> 09:49.950]  but he doesn't lie, cheat or steal. And he's not like addicted to anything.
[09:49.950 --> 09:53.350]  He just does drugs on Friday. He gets really fucked up every Friday.
[09:54.350 --> 09:56.590]  On throughout the week he maintains a fucking life.
[09:56.630 --> 10:01.630]  But the only one anybody ever discusses or that anybody really sees out in public
[10:01.750 --> 10:02.590]  is booze.
[10:03.070 --> 10:08.070]  Like everyone knows 50 people that drink regularly, fairly heavily,
[10:08.510 --> 10:12.230]  but it doesn't influence or fuck up their life in any dramatic ways.
[10:12.230 --> 10:15.710]  Like sure shit might be a little better if they didn't do that,
[10:15.710 --> 10:18.870]  but they get up every morning and they go to work. They come home,
[10:18.870 --> 10:21.430]  they have dinner on the table for the family. They go to bed,
[10:21.470 --> 10:25.110]  they get up and do it all again. The next day they go fishing on the weekends
[10:25.110 --> 10:28.030]  or to little league or whatever the fuck. And no one,
[10:28.190 --> 10:31.510]  no one has any issue with it because it's not impacting anyone else.
[10:31.630 --> 10:33.950]  Yep. Just in a negative way. They're maintaining.
[10:34.990 --> 10:37.630]  And you see it all the time with regular, like that's why
[10:39.110 --> 10:42.550]  I was watching a bunch of anti-pop videos yesterday, so it's kind of on my mind.
[10:42.550 --> 10:46.710]  But uh, why are you watching anti-pop videos? No, your enemy. Okay.
[10:47.590 --> 10:50.150]  You have to know what they're talking about so you know what's going to pop up
[10:50.150 --> 10:51.710]  on our radar is the shit.
[10:51.710 --> 10:55.070]  The anti-pop people are railing about today is the stuff we're dealing with in
[10:55.070 --> 10:58.150]  regulation 18 months from now. Okay. Um,
[10:59.030 --> 10:59.870]  but uh,
[10:59.870 --> 11:03.830]  they don't understand at all the history here or the,
[11:03.830 --> 11:07.190]  the numbers involved in the number of people involved. Um,
[11:07.230 --> 11:09.990]  when you listen to them rant, as far as you can tell,
[11:10.430 --> 11:14.870]  marijuana is something we invented around 2000, like 99, 2000.
[11:14.870 --> 11:18.790]  It just appeared. We manufactured this high THC cush. Yeah.
[11:19.230 --> 11:23.910]  A bunch of people who wanted to get rich off an addiction for profit industry
[11:23.910 --> 11:27.590]  just in showed up with it and started marketing to children.
[11:28.670 --> 11:31.630]  Um, but the reality is it's always been here through all human history.
[11:31.630 --> 11:34.430]  Cannabis has been around. Countless drugs have been around.
[11:34.950 --> 11:36.030]  And for most of that time,
[11:36.030 --> 11:39.110]  most of the consumers have had other shit they had to take care of all day and
[11:39.110 --> 11:40.870]  just did so occasionally for enjoyment.
[11:42.390 --> 11:45.270]  And we went nuts with it 80 years ago. And here we are today.
[11:45.590 --> 11:48.190]  Because we were afraid of colored people, raping white bitches.
[11:48.430 --> 11:51.630]  That's a big part of it. Mostly it's money, money, money, and votes,
[11:51.670 --> 11:55.790]  money and fear and votes and control. Let us do what we want.
[11:55.790 --> 11:58.510]  We won't hurt ourselves. Well, some of us will, but we'll beat ourselves out.
[11:58.870 --> 12:03.310]  Right. Um, before we get too far, hard left people. Sorry about that.
[12:03.350 --> 12:05.670]  That's all right. I'll bring you right back on course. Before we get too far,
[12:05.670 --> 12:08.630]  this podcast is brought to you by our good friends at the dank team.com.
[12:08.630 --> 12:08.990]  That's right.
[12:08.990 --> 12:11.670]  If you're looking to add some regular or feminized seeds to your garden,
[12:11.950 --> 12:16.350]  the dank team.com is where you can find alpha chronic mile high can't adventure.
[12:16.390 --> 12:20.550]  I read genetics, rare dankness, the Kelly connection. Um,
[12:20.990 --> 12:24.270]  you're showing me something. We just had a lab, the plot of labs in city. Wow.
[12:24.270 --> 12:26.510]  You remember the old ad. This is the old ad.
[12:26.510 --> 12:28.670]  I was trying to repeat the old ad from the early episodes,
[12:28.670 --> 12:30.830]  but I'm not sure who's still on there. Anyway,
[12:30.950 --> 12:35.550]  they've got a whole bunch of a very reputable and trustworthy breeders on
[12:35.550 --> 12:38.110]  there. I would highly recommend to get it highly recommended.
[12:38.110 --> 12:41.470]  The dank team.com do it up, let them know Rasta Jeff sent you,
[12:41.470 --> 12:43.630]  let them know you're listening to the grow from your heart podcast.
[12:44.190 --> 12:46.110]  They've got regular, they've got feminized seeds.
[12:46.310 --> 12:49.310]  I highly suggest some I read genetics or some rare dankness,
[12:49.390 --> 12:51.510]  or maybe even some mile high, or you know,
[12:51.510 --> 12:54.430]  who's also really cool. Got some seeds on there probably by now.
[12:54.430 --> 12:57.430]  Hopefully sour seeds is available on there. Check out sour seeds.
[12:57.830 --> 13:00.230]  Get yourself a pack of sour seeds.
[13:01.030 --> 13:03.830]  Go there and do that. I read genetics. It's not a secret.
[13:04.030 --> 13:06.790]  It's my region. You have, if they have that,
[13:08.510 --> 13:11.630]  if they got that storm shadow from I read genetics, that's a really good cross.
[13:11.630 --> 13:15.790]  That's white widow cross to arise. It makes big, giant, super frosty.
[13:16.830 --> 13:21.190]  Oh yeah. Storm shadow. Just like the old school. All right.
[13:21.190 --> 13:25.190]  So let's see. We recorded, we covered Ralphie may we covered the dank team ad
[13:25.550 --> 13:28.230]  bro. Look how far we have gone. 250 episodes.
[13:28.310 --> 13:31.750]  Did you go to just spend a rough week? Like we lost Tom Petty.
[13:31.750 --> 13:33.830]  We lost Ralphie may. Yes.
[13:35.430 --> 13:37.550]  Tom Petty got a shout out on the last episode.
[13:38.710 --> 13:41.510]  It feels like I'm missing somebody. If I'm missing you, I'm sorry.
[13:41.510 --> 13:45.350]  Don't don't make anybody else die with your Ricky Bobby curses.
[13:45.470 --> 13:48.750]  I don't know. No, I lost one of my dogs this week too.
[13:48.790 --> 13:50.230]  Yeah. I'm sorry about that. Last week.
[13:51.630 --> 13:54.430]  Just just been a crazy heavy loss. Couple of days.
[13:54.870 --> 13:58.150]  You're talking about the past week. I'm talking about the past 250 episodes,
[13:58.150 --> 13:58.310]  bro.
[13:58.310 --> 14:01.830]  Remember when we started this and it sounded like it sounded like this in the
[14:01.830 --> 14:02.670]  background.
[14:03.110 --> 14:06.150]  Won't sound like that. Yeah. Yeah. We didn't have any compression.
[14:06.150 --> 14:07.750]  Everything sounded like shit. And now we got,
[14:07.790 --> 14:10.030]  there was none of these blinking lights to look at.
[14:10.190 --> 14:14.030]  I couldn't watch the green bubbles go up and down with the level of my voice.
[14:14.190 --> 14:16.670]  And now we sound all smooth. Like we are NPR.
[14:16.670 --> 14:18.230]  Dude, it sounds nice and crisp.
[14:19.630 --> 14:22.590]  Even like big name people that do podcasting.
[14:22.590 --> 14:25.630]  Now when I listen to most other shows, like man,
[14:26.110 --> 14:27.590]  they need Jeff doing their sound.
[14:27.790 --> 14:30.390]  Yeah. If your podcast is recorded, like through your phone,
[14:30.390 --> 14:33.070]  or if you've got a call in guest, half the time, I won't listen.
[14:33.270 --> 14:34.910]  Then I just can't deal with it. It's gotta be quality.
[14:34.950 --> 14:37.270]  People want to hear quality. People deserve quality.
[14:37.790 --> 14:40.630]  Like honestly, it, it didn't like,
[14:40.630 --> 14:45.150]  neither of us are engineering experts or fucking electronic equipment experts.
[14:45.150 --> 14:46.750]  Like you, you were in the band,
[14:46.750 --> 14:50.590]  you know a lot more about this than your average Joe, but shit.
[14:50.630 --> 14:53.590]  Google it. Listen to Cliff Ravenscrafters on the fricking minutes.
[14:54.190 --> 14:55.790]  Okay. Well that, that's a good, uh,
[14:56.110 --> 15:00.470]  I was going to talk about how proud and grateful I am to have done 250 episodes.
[15:00.470 --> 15:02.350]  Do we started sounding like shit?
[15:02.910 --> 15:06.190]  I never thought he'd make two 50. I figured you'd do like eight and give it up.
[15:06.230 --> 15:07.990]  We get like 5,000 downloads.
[15:08.150 --> 15:11.750]  Every time I put out a new episode within the first 48 hours of releasing a new
[15:11.750 --> 15:13.910]  episode, I get about 5,000 downloads.
[15:14.710 --> 15:19.710]  I bounced between super proud of that number and super like scared of that
[15:20.750 --> 15:21.830]  number. Don't be scared.
[15:22.310 --> 15:24.230]  Every now and then it'll Donald readers like, dude,
[15:24.270 --> 15:28.070]  you've said some insane shit and like 5,000 people downloaded that show.
[15:28.430 --> 15:30.710]  At least. Yeah. Um,
[15:30.710 --> 15:33.870]  some of the shows that we've done that were super in depth,
[15:33.870 --> 15:35.950]  some of the numbers you've told me, I'm like, Oh Jesus.
[15:35.990 --> 15:40.190]  So you know the Fillmore auditorium in Denver? We filled that twice. Easy. Yeah.
[15:40.230 --> 15:42.790]  That's how many people heard that twice that. Right.
[15:42.790 --> 15:45.390]  Like I never would have said that on stage in a room full of people,
[15:45.390 --> 15:48.950]  but it's just you and me and your little recording space.
[15:48.950 --> 15:50.670]  Like we're so comfortable here at this point.
[15:51.710 --> 15:52.830]  Well, thanks for joining us. You guys,
[15:52.830 --> 15:55.190]  I am grateful and I'm proud to have done 250 episodes.
[15:55.470 --> 15:59.350]  And I'm going to keep, uh, keep bringing you more great content.
[15:59.350 --> 16:01.710]  I feel like I've become a good ambassador for cannabis.
[16:01.910 --> 16:05.150]  I'm trying to be a good representative for this plant and share it with
[16:05.150 --> 16:08.390]  everybody in a good positive way. So thank you guys. I'm proud of myself.
[16:08.390 --> 16:10.590]  I'm proud of all the guests and I'm grateful.
[16:10.950 --> 16:13.950]  And I kind of want to thank all of the guests that have been on here,
[16:13.950 --> 16:17.270]  but I don't want to miss anybody. So I don't want to try to say too many names,
[16:17.270 --> 16:20.590]  but of course, Mike, uh, Rob from sour seeds,
[16:20.790 --> 16:25.270]  everybody back in the day, like Adam and Kevin and Jesse. Um,
[16:25.510 --> 16:27.910]  and Mike mentioned a minute ago, Cliff Ravenscraft.
[16:27.910 --> 16:32.150]  If you guys are into podcasting and you need help getting your podcast going,
[16:32.310 --> 16:36.430]  Cliff Ravenscraft is a guy who calls himself the podcast answer, man. Uh,
[16:36.470 --> 16:38.110]  if you go and check out his website,
[16:38.110 --> 16:42.070]  all of his free stuff will improve your podcast. It's free. Uh,
[16:42.070 --> 16:44.110]  just check out what he does. He's kind of on a new thing.
[16:44.350 --> 16:46.910]  He's gotten bored with helping everybody get a podcast going.
[16:46.910 --> 16:47.870]  He's on a new thing,
[16:47.870 --> 16:51.230]  but his old stuff is still there and it will teach you so much shit.
[16:51.230 --> 16:54.310]  And it's all, there's a lot of free content. He does want you to pay for some.
[16:54.310 --> 16:57.710]  I've never paid for anything and I've learned fucking plenty from that dude.
[16:57.990 --> 17:00.670]  There's a ton of information that honestly,
[17:00.670 --> 17:03.270]  if you're doing a podcast regularly, um,
[17:03.270 --> 17:07.230]  and you haven't started looking for people like him to kind of help improve your
[17:07.230 --> 17:11.670]  show this way or that, and it's not like, Oh, every 30 seconds do something funny.
[17:12.230 --> 17:14.670]  It's not that. Oh no, he's real.
[17:14.950 --> 17:18.830]  No, there's a lot of really good information on bringing together a tighter show,
[17:18.830 --> 17:21.350]  a more informative show, a better produce show.
[17:22.390 --> 17:27.070]  How to get more listeners based on your metadata. Just a lot of tricks.
[17:27.110 --> 17:29.190]  Yeah. He really should be doing.
[17:29.190 --> 17:31.470]  He makes a six figure income off of podcasting.
[17:31.510 --> 17:33.510]  He's recorded more podcasts than anybody else.
[17:33.510 --> 17:36.950]  He was one of the first podcasters to have a real podcast on iTunes. Anyway,
[17:36.950 --> 17:39.590]  that's Cliff Ravenscraft. Check him out. I highly endorse him. Thanks Cliff.
[17:39.630 --> 17:44.030]  You'll never listen to my show probably, but thank you. Um, a big, big support.
[17:44.630 --> 17:46.870]  Uh, and of course, everybody that's been here is where I was.
[17:47.110 --> 17:51.190]  The garden of Weeden crew, all of them, uh, sloppy when sloppy used to come and kick
[17:51.190 --> 17:52.190]  it. Sloppy was on the show,
[17:52.190 --> 17:55.270]  but sloppy spent more time on more episodes over there at the dab table.
[17:55.270 --> 17:59.510]  Just chilling. So sloppy has been on a few times. Uh, Joe has been here a few times.
[18:00.110 --> 18:04.230]  Um, granny, um, so many people have been here.
[18:04.270 --> 18:06.710]  The people that granny brought with her every time, uh,
[18:06.750 --> 18:11.390]  all of the places that have let me do a show in their location. Like, uh,
[18:11.590 --> 18:15.510]  of course the Cana Canyon shout out to our friends at the Cana Canyon because I
[18:15.510 --> 18:17.430]  don't want to miss anybody. Shout out to Addison to Maura.
[18:17.430 --> 18:21.190]  He was on like episode number two or three. I dropped a clip of Addison in a big
[18:21.190 --> 18:23.870]  shout out to Addy. Addy just lost his dad. So big shout out to Addy.
[18:23.870 --> 18:27.590]  We've got to send him some strong support also. And people are falling lately.
[18:27.590 --> 18:30.710]  This is getting weird. It's been a weird couple of months, man,
[18:30.830 --> 18:34.030]  but I owe everybody a big thanks. If you've been on the show, uh,
[18:34.030 --> 18:36.310]  thank you. If you listen to the show, thank you.
[18:36.350 --> 18:40.310]  Also more people I need to give a huge thank you to an episode number two 50,

[18:47.150 --> 18:49.150]  I'm not sure who else that of course the dank team,
[18:49.150 --> 18:51.990]  they still sponsor the podcast. They still help us out. Uh,
[18:51.990 --> 18:54.510]  you can get your ivory genetic seeds at the dank team.com.
[18:54.510 --> 18:56.070]  Make sure you check that out. They've got that.
[18:56.070 --> 18:58.030]  They've probably got the Scarlet begonias,
[18:58.050 --> 19:00.210]  which is the redheaded stranger across to arise.
[19:00.210 --> 19:02.590]  I would look and see if they've got that. And if they don't email me and we'll
[19:02.590 --> 19:06.150]  fix it. Uh, they should have a rise also. Um,
[19:06.870 --> 19:09.950]  all the sponsors who have ever are friends at PL grow systems.
[19:10.230 --> 19:13.310]  Big shout out to PL grow systems. I'm pretty sure that's what they call it.
[19:13.470 --> 19:15.830]  I can see PL grow. There's something over the rest of the box.

[19:17.150 --> 19:20.510]  but shout out to those folks for sponsoring the show and sending us products to

[20:03.230 --> 20:06.590]  I apologize. I just looked down and I'm like, you weren't a hosier right now.
[20:06.590 --> 20:09.030]  I'm wearing one of the hoodies and it's so comfy.
[20:09.070 --> 20:10.150]  I'm going to drop a couple of names.

[20:20.430 --> 20:21.390]  I'm sick as fuck.
[20:21.390 --> 20:24.990]  I need help doing a podcast and Adam and Mike and Kevin all showed up.
[20:24.990 --> 20:28.110]  Maybe Jesse, a whole bunch of people showed up one night and we did a podcast.
[20:28.430 --> 20:31.630]  I basically sat here and looked at everybody and nodded and ran knobs cause I
[20:31.630 --> 20:33.990]  didn't feel good, but you guys put out a podcast for me.
[20:34.270 --> 20:36.350]  So thanks to all my friends that support the podcast.
[20:36.350 --> 20:38.430]  Thanks to all my friends that share the podcast,
[20:38.470 --> 20:41.110]  not just the people that come over to the house and record,
[20:41.110 --> 20:43.070]  not just the people that hang out at the dad table,
[20:43.270 --> 20:46.310]  not just the people that I work with that support me, but my friends out there,
[20:46.430 --> 20:49.070]  all my social media friends, the people that I interact with online,
[20:49.070 --> 20:51.270]  the people that I don't interact with in line online,
[20:51.270 --> 20:53.550]  but I try to because I'm overwhelmed with all that stuff.
[20:54.070 --> 20:57.870]  I've said a couple of names. Uh, I don't know who wants their name set on the show.
[20:57.870 --> 20:59.230]  Do you like your initials or people?
[20:59.230 --> 21:02.710]  But I feel like I don't want to stop and go back to make a list.
[21:02.750 --> 21:04.110]  But like there's a guy who's everybody,
[21:04.110 --> 21:08.150]  his initials are a L and he made some seeds and he shared some seeds with me.
[21:08.150 --> 21:10.230]  I don't know if he wants his name said, but shout out to that guy.
[21:10.230 --> 21:11.670]  He knows who he is. Much respect.
[21:12.310 --> 21:15.910]  Doug Doug. One of my favorite episodes I did was with Doug. Yeah.
[21:15.910 --> 21:18.030]  Old Doug is fucking awesome. Big shout out to Doug. Doug.
[21:18.030 --> 21:20.870]  I don't know if you listen dude, but much, much love and respect. Uh,
[21:20.910 --> 21:22.150]  there are a lot of people that I want to mention,
[21:22.150 --> 21:25.230]  but it's hard to remember everybody's name. All the people that helped me out.
[21:25.230 --> 21:28.910]  Thank you. Thank you so much. You guys, a big shout out to everybody. Uh,
[21:28.910 --> 21:32.910]  of course I owe a huge thank you to the always lovely, always beautiful.
[21:32.910 --> 21:36.870]  Miss Jenny Beth. Uh, she's patient. She lets me get my podcast done. Uh,
[21:37.230 --> 21:37.870]  she needs me.
[21:37.870 --> 21:40.430]  She needs my attention and it takes me a little bit of time to get this done.
[21:40.910 --> 21:45.790]  So shout out. Uh, what else we got? All the listeners that trust me,
[21:46.150 --> 21:47.230]  you guys that, uh,
[21:47.630 --> 21:51.150]  that you send me questions and you count on me to take some balls,
[21:51.150 --> 21:56.150]  to take advice you heard on a podcast and take it into your own garden and try
[21:56.390 --> 22:00.430]  it on your children, your children. Exactly. Go. Exactly. Uh,
[22:00.590 --> 22:05.350]  I feel like part of what made me start this podcast was I was reading a bunch of
[22:05.350 --> 22:08.710]  bullshit on forums. People would say, Oh, you've got this kind of bug.
[22:08.830 --> 22:12.310]  Shake up a Mountain Dew and spray that on your leaves. And they would mean it.
[22:12.390 --> 22:15.230]  And I'd be like, wait, what the fuck are you doing? I would, I,
[22:15.430 --> 22:18.950]  people would tell me like, Oh, just grab this random thing out of your house,
[22:18.950 --> 22:21.630]  grind it up and dump it in the pot. And it's like, what?
[22:22.070 --> 22:25.870]  Or somebody told me half a jar of molasses per gallon.
[22:25.950 --> 22:30.230]  Holy fuck. All you need for food. And it's like, what? Like,
[22:31.270 --> 22:33.750]  what? What's going on in some of your grows? Yeah.
[22:33.750 --> 22:36.870]  Just pour half into one gallon and half into the other and make it hot,
[22:36.870 --> 22:40.230]  hot water and then stir it up and pour it into your plants. Wow.
[22:40.750 --> 22:44.550]  And that was advice I was sincerely given is though that was the trick they were
[22:44.570 --> 22:48.070]  using to make their, yeah. A lot of the things I would see online, I would,
[22:48.230 --> 22:50.590]  I would see that just causing two more problems. Yeah, sure.
[22:50.590 --> 22:51.590]  You just got rid of your bugs.
[22:51.590 --> 22:54.110]  Now you've got sticky ass Mountain Dew on the tops of your leaves.
[22:54.110 --> 22:55.550]  Now you're going to get more bugs stuck to that.
[22:55.550 --> 22:56.710]  And your leaves are going to look like shit.
[22:56.710 --> 22:57.790]  And that's going to cause eight more problems.
[22:57.790 --> 23:00.430]  Don't ever put Mountain Dew on your plants. You guys, it was a terrible joke.
[23:00.750 --> 23:04.670]  Don't do that shit. But that's part of why I wanted to do a podcast. Also,
[23:04.670 --> 23:07.110]  I wanted to write a book. I was like, I'm going to write a weed book.
[23:07.110 --> 23:09.550]  And then I was like, a book changes every week. I can't even do that.
[23:09.550 --> 23:13.230]  Like weed changes, cannabis changes, the industry changes, the rules change.
[23:13.470 --> 23:15.870]  So I couldn't write a book every time I'd write the outline and look up
[23:15.870 --> 23:18.190]  something. Well, that's wrong. Now I've got to update this.
[23:18.190 --> 23:21.910]  A podcast is cool because it evolves every seven or five days in my world.
[23:21.950 --> 23:24.670]  I can update you guys and be like, Hey, remember what I said six months ago?
[23:24.910 --> 23:26.350]  Wrong. New tech do this.
[23:27.110 --> 23:30.750]  So we found a better way or a more efficient way or a cheaper way.
[23:31.030 --> 23:33.870]  Yeah. But thanks to everybody that trusts me, because a lot of people send me,
[23:33.870 --> 23:35.750]  I've got, you can see all these emails right here in this folder.
[23:35.950 --> 23:39.110]  People send me stacks of emails and that means that those folks trust me.
[23:39.110 --> 23:41.550]  They know that the information I give them is going to be well thought out.
[23:41.550 --> 23:44.830]  They know the information I give them will be tried and true. And they know that,
[23:45.110 --> 23:49.190]  uh, I am not selling them a product. Sometimes I will recommend some shit.
[23:49.230 --> 23:51.710]  There's some things that you can buy that will help solve your problems.
[23:51.710 --> 23:53.830]  What you're going to need. It's what, that's the best way to do it.
[23:54.310 --> 23:58.470]  But I am not paid by any nutrient companies.
[23:58.470 --> 24:00.790]  I'm not paid by any pesticide companies.
[24:00.990 --> 24:03.990]  There's no money coming my way from anybody right now, honestly,
[24:04.030 --> 24:04.870]  for this podcast,
[24:04.870 --> 24:07.910]  you guys can hear it in the show. Like if you listen to other shows,
[24:07.910 --> 24:11.190]  you can tell when someone's brought you by cheeseburgers.
[24:11.190 --> 24:13.750]  That's part of what inspired this podcast. Also,
[24:13.750 --> 24:18.150]  there was another weed podcast that the first half of the episode,
[24:18.230 --> 24:21.470]  he would read emails. Well, I've got spider mites. What do I do? And he'd,
[24:21.550 --> 24:22.150]  he'd say, well,
[24:22.150 --> 24:25.270]  I would go to the store and buy product a and then turn off the lights and spray
[24:25.270 --> 24:27.910]  the fuck out of product and your problem will be gone.
[24:28.190 --> 24:30.230]  And then he would go on and act like the show was natural.
[24:30.470 --> 24:32.470]  And then 30 minutes into the show, they'd go, well,
[24:32.470 --> 24:34.310]  now we're going to take a break. And then the ad would come up.
[24:34.470 --> 24:37.430]  This podcast brought you by product a, and you'd be like, Oh,
[24:37.430 --> 24:38.630]  is that why you recommended product?
[24:38.630 --> 24:40.830]  It's the start of the fucking show because they paid you money.
[24:41.270 --> 24:43.310]  It was a fake email. Nobody had that problem.
[24:43.310 --> 24:45.630]  You made that shit up so that you could pitch that product to make some money.
[24:45.630 --> 24:47.150]  I don't do that. You guys, I'm gonna do that.
[24:47.150 --> 24:48.710]  I'm not trying to make some money off of products.
[24:48.710 --> 24:51.270]  I want you to be able to do it for free if it's possible.
[24:51.590 --> 24:55.030]  I'll tell you what I use and you can use that. And it's not,
[24:55.230 --> 25:00.230]  no, here's the tips and tricks that he's using personally and has seen success
[25:00.430 --> 25:05.110]  with. Uh, it's not getting recommended cause there's a percentage on it. Yeah.
[25:05.110 --> 25:06.230]  It's totally what I would use.
[25:06.230 --> 25:10.790]  Like I mentioned like products like grand Devo and evergreen and cease, uh,
[25:10.830 --> 25:13.910]  things like that. We actually use in commercial cultivation facilities.
[25:13.910 --> 25:15.870]  That's what I would recommend all of the time.
[25:16.910 --> 25:20.550]  Today we had a guy ask you, what do you think about ladybugs?
[25:21.990 --> 25:26.950]  You gave verbatim the same answer. I mean, not word for word,
[25:26.950 --> 25:31.230]  but incredibly close that you gave on the podcast three, four months ago. Yeah.
[25:31.870 --> 25:33.750]  Um, here's what we use. Here's where you can get them.
[25:34.150 --> 25:36.510]  Here's why they're superior to ladybugs. Yeah.
[25:36.590 --> 25:38.670]  Because the dude was blown away.
[25:38.670 --> 25:42.270]  His eyes got really big and I could see him like itching to take his phone out
[25:42.270 --> 25:45.830]  and start writing shit town. Yeah. Ladybugs are cute you guys,
[25:45.830 --> 25:49.750]  but most of them end up in your ducting and in your shop vac ladybugs are,
[25:49.950 --> 25:52.950]  they're great for photography, but they, I don't think they're going to do it.
[25:52.990 --> 25:55.550]  Get some Swarovski mites. Those are going to do you much better.
[25:56.070 --> 25:57.430]  Those are going to do a lot better work for you.
[25:57.750 --> 25:59.630]  But thank you guys for trusting me. That means a lot to me.
[25:59.910 --> 26:02.310]  And I know that you trust me because you continue to send me emails.
[26:02.310 --> 26:05.630]  You continue to interact with me. You continue to tweet me. Uh,
[26:05.630 --> 26:09.110]  a lot of you continue to send me messages on the Instagram and you keep
[26:09.110 --> 26:11.950]  listening to the podcast. So that lets me know it's working. Thank you.
[26:11.990 --> 26:14.750]  That means a lot to me. I do put a lot of work into this podcast.
[26:14.750 --> 26:17.590]  It sounds like you just hit record and you talk, but, uh,
[26:17.830 --> 26:20.390]  I've got pages and pages of notes and thousands of dollars in gear.
[26:20.390 --> 26:21.390]  So there's a lot going into it.
[26:21.550 --> 26:24.710]  So it's good to know that it's worth all the effort to you guys.
[26:25.030 --> 26:27.510]  Sometimes we do just get really high and hit record.
[26:27.510 --> 26:31.270]  But the only reason we're able to do that is because two years of homework went
[26:31.270 --> 26:32.270]  into being able to do that.
[26:32.350 --> 26:35.430]  Yeah. This isn't going to be one of those shows where you need to get out your
[26:35.430 --> 26:37.510]  notebook. This is not going to be one.
[26:37.710 --> 26:40.590]  We could turn it into one, but it'd be a real move at this point.
[26:42.030 --> 26:43.910]  Just hide it at the end. Make it like an Easter egg.
[26:44.110 --> 26:48.070]  Last like eight minutes. Super great way. Super tricks. No, no,
[26:48.070 --> 26:50.270]  we're not going to do that to you guys. This is going to be number two 50.
[26:50.270 --> 26:53.430]  I'm going to, I feel much better. You guys, when I started this podcast,
[26:53.430 --> 26:56.350]  I honestly felt like shit. Mike's like, dude, if you want to call it, we can.
[26:56.710 --> 26:59.630]  No, I drink. There's a reason I handed you a hash that tastes like cherry.
[26:59.630 --> 27:04.470]  I drank two bottles of water and the second one has a packet of emergency in it.
[27:04.470 --> 27:05.990]  It's vitamin C and electrolytes.
[27:06.270 --> 27:09.230]  And then I ate a bowl of noodles and a handful of snacks.
[27:09.390 --> 27:11.470]  And that really put me back on my game.
[27:11.470 --> 27:13.990]  And then just getting talking really got me gone. I feel a lot better now.
[27:13.990 --> 27:15.990]  So thanks for bringing me back out of my coma, bro.
[27:16.470 --> 27:18.710]  But what I was going to say was since it's episode two 15,
[27:18.710 --> 27:19.710]  we're just chatting our faces off.
[27:19.710 --> 27:22.230]  We're going to take a couple of fat dads here in a couple of seconds.
[27:22.230 --> 27:23.750]  It's going to take a couple of seconds to get to that.
[27:23.750 --> 27:25.190]  Cause I know that's going to unleash the chat.
[27:25.190 --> 27:26.830]  I can't see your list.
[27:27.430 --> 27:31.270]  And this just occurred to me that I wanted to send a huge shout out to all the
[27:31.270 --> 27:34.710]  people that have emailed the show over the years and all the people who are
[27:34.710 --> 27:39.550]  thinking about emailing the show in the future. Um, the last couple episodes,
[27:40.030 --> 27:43.270]  um, like I haven't been over here on a show and I can't even tell you how long
[27:43.630 --> 27:47.750]  Barry Oka tell us. Um, but I could shout out to Barry.
[27:47.910 --> 27:50.790]  Shout out Barry. You're awesome, man. Um,
[27:51.550 --> 27:54.670]  I was so happy to get that tweet from you. Um,
[27:55.030 --> 27:56.470]  I've been itching to get back over here,
[27:56.470 --> 28:00.550]  but the last couple of shows that were heavy email based were really,
[28:00.550 --> 28:03.070]  really good. I loved the parenting show.
[28:03.430 --> 28:06.510]  And I know that's not a show that Dawn's on you, um,
[28:06.510 --> 28:08.990]  without that prompt from the listener. And it's not,
[28:09.430 --> 28:11.910]  I wouldn't have called you and been like, dude, let's do a parenting show.
[28:11.990 --> 28:15.270]  Right. Even though I'm a new parent, I'm thinking about that shit all the time.
[28:15.270 --> 28:17.990]  I had a couple of friends who are parents. They're like, what the fuck dude,
[28:18.030 --> 28:22.350]  I should have been on that show. Like, and I know, I know, but I know sometimes I
[28:22.350 --> 28:25.510]  can't, I can't get everybody on the podcast all the time. Sometimes, honestly,
[28:25.950 --> 28:29.030]  I want to, I know what day I want to record. My goal is to record on Thursday.
[28:29.030 --> 28:31.670]  I liked it, but sometimes it'll be Tuesday night and I can't sleep.
[28:31.670 --> 28:32.750]  And I'm like, fuck it. Here we go.
[28:32.750 --> 28:35.710]  And I'll just get up and record a show at midnight and I'll just record it just
[28:35.710 --> 28:39.110]  because I'm in the mood. And I feel like podcasting is maybe,
[28:39.150 --> 28:41.990]  maybe not everybody would feel this way. I feel like it's kind of like music.
[28:41.990 --> 28:43.710]  It's kind of like an art. And if I'm in the mood to do it,
[28:43.710 --> 28:46.190]  I should do it because it's going to come out way better than when I'm not in
[28:46.190 --> 28:49.070]  the mood. I'm sure you guys have heard at least one or two episodes.
[28:49.070 --> 28:51.070]  And I'm like, all right, fuckers on this episode,
[28:52.230 --> 28:56.070]  phoning it in. Fuck you. Here's a show. There's been a couple of those.
[28:56.110 --> 28:58.950]  There were a couple of shows where like, we just couldn't trim anymore.
[28:59.590 --> 29:01.510]  Yeah. We needed a long break,
[29:01.510 --> 29:04.310]  like go and grab a bite to eat and come back and get back to work.
[29:04.310 --> 29:06.310]  Wasn't going to cut it. So we did that.
[29:06.310 --> 29:08.870]  And then we did a show and then we chilled for a little bit.
[29:08.870 --> 29:11.790]  And then we got back to work. Let the eyes uncross. Yep.
[29:11.830 --> 29:14.390]  Let the hands on cramp and just sit and chill for a minute.
[29:14.590 --> 29:16.270]  So yeah. Shout out to everybody that emails us.
[29:16.430 --> 29:18.110]  We do appreciate all of the interaction,
[29:18.230 --> 29:21.470]  even though I can't respond to all of you. I apologize, dude. It is,
[29:21.470 --> 29:26.030]  I work a 40 plus hour a week job. Plus I've got my,
[29:26.390 --> 29:30.990]  I am I read genetics. I run that company as well. Plus I've got the podcast.
[29:30.990 --> 29:33.870]  Plus I've got my own personal relationships. Plus I'm a father.
[29:34.670 --> 29:36.510]  That should have been way higher on that fucking list.
[29:36.510 --> 29:38.430]  I apologize for failing at life right there,
[29:41.190 --> 29:44.630]  but I've got a lot going on. Yeah.
[29:45.790 --> 29:46.630]  I just failed at life.
[29:46.630 --> 29:49.750]  No sweet like dude, I'm getting emails from one of the bosses.
[29:49.790 --> 29:51.550]  I'm getting emails from an applicant.
[29:51.630 --> 29:54.390]  Oh yeah. And my emails from the bosses never stop our bosses.
[29:54.670 --> 29:56.910]  It's my kid's bedtime plus 12 minutes.
[29:56.910 --> 29:59.150]  So like I should be doing story time right now.
[29:59.390 --> 30:03.150]  I am the lead cultivator at three rivers and Mike is the metric guy at three
[30:03.150 --> 30:07.670]  rivers. So we stay busy with emails from bosses. Uh, he's the front of the house.
[30:07.670 --> 30:08.470]  I'm the back of the house.
[30:08.470 --> 30:10.750]  We meet in the middle and talk about a lot of stuff all the time.
[30:10.990 --> 30:14.150]  So we do get a lot of emails. We're involved with every decision made.
[30:14.150 --> 30:16.750]  What we try to be involved with every decision made with that business.
[30:17.070 --> 30:20.430]  So we do stay completely busy, but we, well, we do interact.
[30:20.430 --> 30:22.590]  I interact with as many of the emails as I can.
[30:23.270 --> 30:26.590]  A lot of times I just get at you when I'm pooping or falling asleep or whatever.
[30:26.910 --> 30:30.790]  I do what I can. I'm trying, but I appreciate it. I D it doesn't go unnoticed.
[30:30.990 --> 30:32.870]  I print most of the good emails out.
[30:33.630 --> 30:36.510]  When I come over and join those shows, it doesn't help.
[30:36.510 --> 30:38.150]  Cause let's try to do three emails.
[30:38.150 --> 30:40.630]  This show becomes like we got through most of an email.
[30:40.630 --> 30:42.790]  This show, you get a little chatter. You want to get you high,
[30:42.790 --> 30:44.390]  but I'm good with that. Yeah. Hey,
[30:44.390 --> 30:47.110]  it's working because like I'm going to segue into my next bullet point.
[30:47.110 --> 30:50.030]  Nice and smoothly here. Uh, this week on stitcher,
[30:50.270 --> 30:54.430]  we are ranked 595 crushed overall. Yeah.
[30:54.430 --> 30:58.030]  There are a lot of shows on stitcher. I was trying to research how many, uh,
[30:58.030 --> 31:00.990]  in one section I saw 25,000 and another section,
[31:00.990 --> 31:05.870]  they boast 40,000 shows like 40,000 titles of different shows are available on
[31:05.870 --> 31:07.230]  stitcher. I don't know which is true.
[31:07.230 --> 31:10.470]  If somebody wants to do the real research and find out and tweet me, uh,
[31:10.470 --> 31:12.670]  send me a tweet. It's at GFYH podcast. Let me know.
[31:12.670 --> 31:13.950]  Cause that way I don't have to search for it.
[31:13.950 --> 31:15.790]  And I can put that energy into a good show.
[31:15.830 --> 31:18.630]  The part of that question I like is that for your show,
[31:18.630 --> 31:22.590]  it doesn't matter so much if there are 20,000 or 40,000 cause you're better
[31:22.590 --> 31:24.270]  than all, but 540 of them.
[31:26.550 --> 31:30.670]  And also I was hyping myself up. I was like, I want to be on that top 100.
[31:30.670 --> 31:32.550]  But then I thought about it. I was like, we're a cannabis show.
[31:32.870 --> 31:36.390]  Like we're a very niche. I've got a very niche show here.
[31:37.790 --> 31:39.510]  It depends where you look at it.
[31:39.510 --> 31:43.830]  The cannabis consuming population is somewhere between, um,
[31:43.830 --> 31:47.910]  like 10 and 25% of the population is like everybody's good. Yes.
[31:47.910 --> 31:49.670]  My real guess is that, uh,
[31:49.710 --> 31:54.550]  you'll take a couple of hits at a concert or a few times a year is closer to 40%.
[31:54.550 --> 31:57.550]  But I mean, even then that's fucking pushing it.
[31:57.670 --> 32:00.710]  It's not like other shit that where they're pulling 20 million views a week.
[32:00.830 --> 32:01.670]  Right.
[32:01.910 --> 32:05.910]  The amount of people that listen to podcasts and the amount of people that smoke
[32:05.910 --> 32:08.950]  cannabis and the amount of people that actually give a shit enough about
[32:08.950 --> 32:12.630]  cannabis to listen to a podcast, that's kind of a small pocket of people there.
[32:12.830 --> 32:17.470]  But one thing I've noticed my demographic is the exact same on my Instagram feed
[32:17.470 --> 32:18.950]  as it is on my podcast.
[32:19.750 --> 32:24.590]  Most of the people are from Denver to Los Angeles or Portland and 80% of them
[32:24.670 --> 32:28.310]  are men. And most of them are men between like 21 and 35.
[32:28.350 --> 32:32.990]  That's mostly who's listening to my podcast. So what's up guys. Hi ladies.
[32:33.190 --> 32:36.710]  I don't mean to leave you out. I invite your female friends to listen to the show.
[32:36.750 --> 32:40.510]  I get it. I don't draw the ladies. I'm not a lady magnet. That's all right with me.
[32:40.790 --> 32:43.470]  If they could see the Chewbacca costume, I think things will be different.
[32:43.470 --> 32:47.950]  Brr. Anyway, I was ranked, we were ranked, the show was ranked, not me.
[32:47.950 --> 32:52.590]  It's my podcast. It was number 39 and lifestyle and health on stitcher radio.
[32:52.670 --> 32:55.070]  Yeah. Number 39 in the lifestyle and health category.
[32:55.070 --> 32:57.350]  So thank you guys for listening on stitcher. I appreciate it.
[32:57.670 --> 33:00.510]  Also thanks for all the wonderful comments on iTunes.
[33:00.510 --> 33:04.470]  I still have not gotten anything but five star reviews on iTunes. Yes.
[33:04.590 --> 33:08.630]  Episode two 15, nothing but five stars. You know, what's, what's uh,
[33:08.670 --> 33:09.750]  what's awkward about that.
[33:09.750 --> 33:14.430]  They don't list you in a lot of shit until you get a negative review because
[33:14.870 --> 33:16.950]  like who cares about all these positive reviews.
[33:16.950 --> 33:19.910]  You have to get a negative one to fall into their algorithm. Nobody knows.
[33:19.950 --> 33:23.310]  Like, yeah, yeah. Because it's like you're just trolling now. Right now I'm fake.
[33:23.310 --> 33:26.510]  Did you just beg for it? Well maybe I hope not. Please don't do that.
[33:26.510 --> 33:29.590]  You guys do a Barry five stars all around you guys. Come on. We're doing good.
[33:29.910 --> 33:33.870]  Doing a real, I'm doing keep the streak alive. Do we need to edit that out?
[33:34.030 --> 33:38.190]  I'm just kidding. You just taunted all 5,000 listeners a little bit.
[33:38.190 --> 33:42.230]  Please do not do it because come on. I like that five star rating. That's awesome.
[33:42.550 --> 33:45.710]  Um, what else do I want to say? Thursday shows you guys,
[33:45.990 --> 33:49.510]  are you listening to the throwback Thursday episodes that I put out every
[33:49.510 --> 33:52.950]  Thursday? I've been putting out what I call the throwback Thursday episodes.
[33:53.070 --> 33:56.230]  Let me explain how, who, what, when, where, why, and how I'm doing all of that.
[33:56.430 --> 34:00.470]  What happens is iTunes and stitcher hold 100 episodes in the feed.
[34:00.590 --> 34:02.390]  Being that this is episode number 250.
[34:02.390 --> 34:06.110]  That means there's 150 episodes that you don't get to listen to because they're
[34:06.110 --> 34:08.790]  not in the feed. What I'm doing for you because I love you guys.
[34:09.030 --> 34:13.550]  I'm making old episodes into large three or four hour chunks. Say it, Mike,
[34:13.550 --> 34:17.670]  you got some smart ass from his heart guys. Yes. I love you.
[34:17.910 --> 34:20.030]  Anyhow, I'm taking old episodes.
[34:20.030 --> 34:24.310]  Really does give up his computer for like six hours per Thursday show.
[34:24.710 --> 34:28.910]  So he can post that bitch to all the, all the streams. Cause it's three,
[34:28.990 --> 34:31.950]  three hours and change usually like it's a little long show. Yeah.
[34:32.270 --> 34:34.870]  It's usually like three, maybe four, sometimes five episodes.
[34:35.710 --> 34:38.150]  Denver and back. It's perfect. Yeah. Yeah.
[34:38.150 --> 34:40.790]  And people that have long jobs that are at work all day, they love it.
[34:41.150 --> 34:43.630]  But I take old episodes and I put them in chunks. Uh,
[34:43.630 --> 34:46.470]  that way instead of putting one episode in the feed,
[34:46.470 --> 34:48.870]  I can give you like four episodes,
[34:48.870 --> 34:52.310]  put them back into the feed and you can listen to that old shit without knocking
[34:52.310 --> 34:55.550]  out a bunch of new content. You get to go back and listen. Um,
[34:55.750 --> 34:57.630]  so that's what's happening on the Thursday shows.
[34:57.910 --> 35:00.510]  So all the Thursday episodes are old. Uh,
[35:00.510 --> 35:02.870]  there's something else I want to mention in that,
[35:02.870 --> 35:05.710]  but I don't know which order to do this. Also on YouTube,
[35:05.910 --> 35:09.550]  I'm putting up old episodes on YouTube because YouTube doesn't limit how much
[35:09.550 --> 35:13.230]  content I put up. Uh, by the time this comes out, there'll be close to a hundred.
[35:13.230 --> 35:14.550]  I kept saying a hundred episodes,
[35:14.870 --> 35:18.150]  episode 100 is scheduled to release within the next couple of days.
[35:18.150 --> 35:20.710]  It's up there. It's in my YouTube feed, but it has not released it.
[35:20.710 --> 35:23.110]  Like 99 and a hundred need to come out, but they're there.
[35:23.430 --> 35:25.590]  So all I have to do is wait for that scheduled time to come out.
[35:25.630 --> 35:27.950]  I've got them set up on YouTube to do that. Uh,
[35:27.950 --> 35:31.630]  so check out the grow from your heart podcast, YouTube channel.
[35:31.870 --> 35:35.870]  The first 20 shows are on the I grow culture podcast channel.
[35:35.870 --> 35:39.110]  Remember when the show was called I grow culture. So when I first started,
[35:39.110 --> 35:43.350]  you guys, the first, that first 50 episodes, we were called I grow culture. Uh,
[35:43.390 --> 35:45.990]  but there's apparently a,
[35:46.750 --> 35:51.150]  an educational program called I grow culture that teaches college level
[35:51.150 --> 35:52.470]  agriculture courses.
[35:52.750 --> 35:55.710]  And they didn't like my little weed podcast ripping off their name.
[35:56.230 --> 35:59.310]  So we quickly changed that to the grow from your heart podcast. Once we,
[35:59.670 --> 36:01.750]  once they said, Hey, we've already got that. And I was like, oh fuck,
[36:01.750 --> 36:04.470]  I don't want your name. I want my own name. I just didn't,
[36:04.510 --> 36:08.070]  I Googled it and nothing came up. Yeah. There was, there was no, no harshness.
[36:08.110 --> 36:10.470]  They just sent a little thing saying, Hey, by the way,
[36:10.470 --> 36:14.150]  that's already taken. And we immediately started working on a new name. Yeah.
[36:14.190 --> 36:17.710]  And the next I was like on episode 50, we'll drop the new name. And we did that.
[36:17.870 --> 36:21.030]  So the first 20 episodes are on the old, I grow culture feed, uh,
[36:21.070 --> 36:24.470]  21 through whatever, 99 or a hundred. Now, uh,
[36:24.510 --> 36:26.550]  there are like 105 episodes in that feed,
[36:26.710 --> 36:30.150]  but only the first 99 or so are available. Those are on the grow from your heart,
[36:30.510 --> 36:34.230]  a feed on YouTube. So search for that, click subscribe, follow us there.
[36:35.150 --> 36:36.510]  Once I get enough videos caught up,
[36:36.510 --> 36:38.750]  I may put up other random videos like other stuff.
[36:38.750 --> 36:42.150]  That's not actually podcast episodes. I may put that up on that channel.
[36:42.150 --> 36:45.070]  Just pictures of me doing random shit, but I want to get caught up first.
[36:45.350 --> 36:48.190]  That's a little bit ways away. All right.
[36:48.230 --> 36:49.750]  When I was talking about the Thursday shows,
[36:49.770 --> 36:52.870]  I said there was something else I wanted to mention. This is totally random.
[36:53.310 --> 36:55.550]  If, uh, don't cheat. That's all I'm going to say.
[36:56.110 --> 36:59.830]  If you know me and you were here when it happened or anything like that,
[37:00.030 --> 37:03.670]  don't cheat because this is going to be a contest. I've got a prize.
[37:03.710 --> 37:07.910]  11 fuck cat. Mike already won. Contest is over. Sorry.
[37:08.910 --> 37:12.230]  Fuck. Well, here's another contest. I got another idea. Mike, you get a prize.
[37:12.230 --> 37:14.790]  It's a kick in the dick. Oh, here it comes.
[37:15.430 --> 37:18.590]  Yeah. That's the magic of radio. Um, I do have a prize though.
[37:19.070 --> 37:21.390]  And I'm not going to tell you what the prize is because it depends on your
[37:21.430 --> 37:23.710]  location and your age. If you were here in Colorado,
[37:23.790 --> 37:25.910]  it's fucking cooler than it is if you're in fucking Delaware,
[37:26.190 --> 37:30.870]  but they'll look at Mike's face. Yes. I picked Delaware. Sorry, Delaware.
[37:30.870 --> 37:32.550]  You're going to get a t-shirt and some stickers.
[37:34.230 --> 37:37.310]  On the Thursday episodes during the intro music,
[37:37.350 --> 37:41.030]  there are several voices hidden in there. Several voices. Yes.
[37:41.070 --> 37:44.950]  There's a voice backwards. If you can tell me who the backwards voice is,
[37:44.990 --> 37:48.750]  I will give you a prize. Also, there's one that goes, oh shit.
[37:48.750 --> 37:51.910]  Rasta Jeff in the house. If you can tell me who that is,
[37:52.190 --> 37:55.990]  I will give you a prize. Do not fucking cheat. If you were here, or if you know,
[37:56.070 --> 37:58.510]  don't tell anybody that's a dick move. Don't cheat.
[37:58.710 --> 38:02.390]  I want not cheaters to win this prize. I have no idea. Yeah.
[38:02.430 --> 38:04.070]  People are going to listen and then maybe somebody will know.
[38:04.110 --> 38:07.350]  Maybe somebody will figure it out. 11 cat are the answers. People.
[38:07.350 --> 38:09.750]  Those are not the answers. It's people's names.
[38:09.830 --> 38:12.750]  And unless you have a friend named 11 and we do have a friend named cat,
[38:12.750 --> 38:17.710]  but that is not who, uh, we have a friend named 44. Yes we do. Yes we do.
[38:17.710 --> 38:20.110]  So I guess 11 wouldn't be that strange of a name.
[38:20.150 --> 38:24.830]  No 11 would have been better than 44 if you know why he's called 44. Anywho.
[38:25.110 --> 38:28.110]  Uh, but there's a prize and then I'm not promising you what the prize is,
[38:28.110 --> 38:31.630]  but I'll send you something. Uh, if you, if you nail one of those, uh,
[38:31.630 --> 38:35.630]  there's a backwards thing. And if you can nail who the backwards voice is.
[38:36.390 --> 38:38.790]  And then if you could tell me who says, oh shit,
[38:38.830 --> 38:43.030]  Rasta Jeff in the house, two chances to win on the backwards one.
[38:43.750 --> 38:47.310]  If you can tell me what they say frontwards,
[38:48.230 --> 38:50.430]  you get a bonus prize because that's a fucking challenge.
[38:50.430 --> 38:53.230]  There's the backwards voice to identify, identify what they said.
[38:53.230 --> 38:56.750]  And then a totally different voice says, oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house,
[38:57.110 --> 38:59.470]  identify that voice. There's a prize in it for you.
[38:59.910 --> 39:04.550]  And is this mixed into all the intros for the Thursday episodes or just one
[39:04.550 --> 39:08.070]  specific that they got to go find? Um, it's, uh,
[39:08.110 --> 39:11.710]  I think I used the same one on episode two 40. Let me,
[39:11.710 --> 39:12.510]  I'm going to look in my phone.
[39:12.510 --> 39:14.870]  You talk for a second about something and I'm going to go look in the phone here
[39:14.870 --> 39:17.790]  and we'll see which two episodes they're throwback Thursday episodes.
[39:18.230 --> 39:20.830]  It's about a, well, they can't be too far behind.
[39:20.830 --> 39:24.110]  I just don't want to be wrong on the number. I think it's 48 and four to 48 and
[39:24.110 --> 39:27.390]  two 46, but my phone's opening it up right now. I better turn down.
[39:27.470 --> 39:29.350]  I don't want it to go playing through the fucking,
[39:30.830 --> 39:35.270]  if anybody was curious, the sample through, I was listening to the, uh,
[39:35.470 --> 39:37.790]  Joe Rogan podcast with Whitney Cummings on it.
[39:37.790 --> 39:40.670]  Last is what it looks like. I was listening to nice. Uh,
[39:40.670 --> 39:43.350]  throwback Thursday number two 48 is the episode.
[39:44.350 --> 39:46.870]  What if I just play it right now? Don't do it. Don't do it.
[39:46.870 --> 39:50.270]  But then that would give, okay. All right. Then Mike said, don't do it.
[39:50.270 --> 39:54.630]  You guys know you got to, you got to listen to show a little initiative.
[39:54.710 --> 39:59.710]  If you want to win the prize. Oh shit. I'd go listen to that.
[39:59.870 --> 40:03.470]  Yeah. The prize is much cooler. If you're over 21 and you live near me,
[40:03.470 --> 40:06.670]  the prize gets much fucking cooler. Trust me. Yeah.
[40:06.950 --> 40:09.590]  There's some imaginary lines that limit prize capabilities.
[40:09.590 --> 40:13.510]  That's the truth. That is the truth. Um,
[40:13.950 --> 40:18.590]  well bullet point or my next bullet point is shitty.
[40:19.430 --> 40:23.590]  So you take that tiny flow dab on here. You don't want this.
[40:24.190 --> 40:27.590]  Take that dab. And then I will talk about this bad news I've got.
[40:27.950 --> 40:31.310]  And then we, I will take another dab after that. Okay.
[40:31.710 --> 40:35.590]  Here is the rig. Do we want to pause and dab? No, we'll just keep doing this.
[40:35.590 --> 40:38.110]  This is number two 50. We haven't done shit yet.
[40:38.270 --> 40:39.910]  So why are we going to press pause for this?
[40:39.910 --> 40:42.910]  So this, the plane engine sound that you're about to hear, that's the torch.
[40:42.910 --> 40:45.750]  I'll turn down your mic just a little bit so that you don't hear Mike dabbing
[40:45.750 --> 40:49.070]  and coughing too much over there. So, um, I'm gonna,
[40:49.150 --> 40:51.590]  I'm gonna talk for a minute while Mike gets a dad going for himself.
[40:51.990 --> 40:55.710]  There are a couple of people out there that I want to talk about for a second.
[40:55.710 --> 40:59.750]  I want to send some love and some light and some support on some words of
[40:59.750 --> 41:04.070]  encouragement and a thank you and a whole lot of stuff all at once. Um,
[41:04.070 --> 41:07.390]  many years ago I stumbled across a guy known as sub cool.
[41:07.750 --> 41:11.110]  There's a guy out there called sub cool and he runs a company called TGA genetics,
[41:11.550 --> 41:16.430]  uh, the green Avengers, team green Avengers and sub cool. And his wife,
[41:16.430 --> 41:20.070]  I'm not, I'm pretty sure that's his wife known as miss Jill, MZ period. Jill,
[41:20.070 --> 41:24.510]  miss Jill are known for breeding some amazing strains of cannabis.
[41:24.910 --> 41:27.030]  I want to give Jill credit cause we're going to do ladies first.
[41:27.070 --> 41:29.230]  Jill bred a strain called Jilly bean.
[41:29.750 --> 41:32.990]  You've heard me talk about Jilly bean on this show a whole fucking bunch.
[41:32.990 --> 41:36.230]  You haven't heard the name sub cool and miss Jill, but you listened to this show.
[41:36.270 --> 41:39.790]  You've definitely heard about their work and things they've created.
[41:40.270 --> 41:43.430]  So, uh, miss Jill has created the Jilly bean.
[41:43.430 --> 41:45.630]  Miss Jill also created Brian Berry cough.
[41:45.630 --> 41:49.070]  Brian Berry cough was made for Jill's friend Brian who had a, uh,
[41:50.470 --> 41:53.350]  it's not a disease, it's a condition, a disorder called ALS.
[41:53.390 --> 41:56.870]  It's a syndrome is what it is. I try to be correct on those types of things,
[41:57.230 --> 41:59.750]  but he had something called ALS, which is a terrible condition.
[42:00.670 --> 42:02.310]  Eric's disease, correct? Yeah.
[42:02.310 --> 42:05.390]  He was in a wheelchair and he couldn't control his body completely. And yeah,
[42:05.390 --> 42:08.510]  it was, it was sad to watch, but Jill loved him. They were friends from school.
[42:08.550 --> 42:10.670]  So she bred a strawberry cough.
[42:10.710 --> 42:14.670]  She got Kyle Cushman strawberry cough from Kyle and they bred space dude,
[42:14.830 --> 42:19.190]  which is their space queen male, which is the equivalent of my King Solomon arise.
[42:19.950 --> 42:23.430]  It's their version. It's their plant. It's not the same strain or anything.
[42:23.430 --> 42:25.390]  I'm just saying that's like, I've got the arise. They got the space dude.
[42:25.390 --> 42:27.030]  It's their staple. It's their main thing.
[42:27.430 --> 42:31.270]  They bred that and miss Jill bred that and made the Brian Berry cough for her
[42:31.510 --> 42:35.830]  friend. Brian sub cool is famous because of many strains.
[42:36.190 --> 42:40.710]  Um, Apollo 13 space queen vortex, the void.
[42:40.990 --> 42:43.830]  Let me turn that mic down for you. There you go. That sounds way better. Uh,
[42:43.870 --> 42:48.830]  the void. Um, there's so many good strains that came from sub cool team T uh,
[42:49.070 --> 42:53.150]  team green Avengers also does Dr. Who the nine pound hammer.
[42:53.470 --> 42:56.110]  A lot of those things are coming from that camp and that crew.
[42:56.150 --> 42:59.670]  Do you remember how far we used to drive for vortex? Yes. I used to drive.
[42:59.670 --> 43:00.870]  I live in Pueblo, Colorado.
[43:00.870 --> 43:03.150]  There's a dispensary in Colorado Springs called the clinic.
[43:03.430 --> 43:06.110]  It is at exit one Oh two or one Oh four, which one's Colorado.
[43:06.190 --> 43:09.830]  We used to go all the way up to Colorado Boulevard in Mexico and Denver to visit
[43:09.830 --> 43:12.950]  the clinic Denver. Yes. And I would buy all of the vortex hash.
[43:12.950 --> 43:15.630]  They had all that. They would let me buy. I would buy all of it.
[43:15.630 --> 43:18.510]  That vortex hash was fucking amazingly delicious.
[43:18.550 --> 43:21.830]  There was a trip where the van was like half full and we were all buying you
[43:21.830 --> 43:25.430]  vortex. Yes. Just sell me. Just everybody go get the limit of vortex.
[43:25.430 --> 43:28.430]  I'll buy it and then I'll give you guys a bonus for doing this for me.
[43:28.830 --> 43:33.310]  So anyway, if you look at my photography and if you look at sub cools
[43:33.310 --> 43:37.390]  photography, it is very obvious that sub cool inspired my grow style,
[43:37.390 --> 43:40.590]  inspired my photography, inspired a lot of things. I,
[43:40.670 --> 43:44.350]  I pull from a lot of sources sub cool being one of the main influences.
[43:44.350 --> 43:46.750]  When I started growing, he was just very available. He had a,
[43:46.790 --> 43:50.470]  he has a show called the weed nerd where he will teach you a lot. Uh,
[43:50.470 --> 43:52.870]  sub cool is the weed nerd four 20 on Instagram.
[43:52.870 --> 43:56.550]  He's probably live right now. If you want to log on and watch,
[43:56.550 --> 44:01.470]  he's doing something sub cool inspired me a lot. Miss Jill inspired me a lot.
[44:01.990 --> 44:06.470]  Uh, sub cool taught me about breeding sub cool taught me about growing sub cool.
[44:06.630 --> 44:09.830]  The plush Berry that I made black cherry chem with came from sub cool.
[44:10.110 --> 44:14.150]  These, uh, space queen that I made space bitch with came from sub cool.
[44:14.550 --> 44:18.390]  I'm kissing sub cools ass. Cause I love him. He inspired me a lot without sub cool
[44:18.390 --> 44:21.390]  and team green Avengers and miss Jill, there would be no, I read genetics.
[44:21.390 --> 44:24.790]  I would not be who and where I am today without that inspiration and the little
[44:24.830 --> 44:29.670]  bit of guidance. We spent a lot of time watching sub cool shows and just learning,
[44:29.670 --> 44:32.710]  absorbing, learning to think in things in different ways.
[44:32.750 --> 44:35.470]  The first few times he interacted with me on social media,
[44:35.470 --> 44:38.630]  I didn't know what to do with myself. I was like, how do I reply to this?
[44:38.630 --> 44:39.910]  I had to like take a moment. I was like,
[44:40.430 --> 44:44.870]  I don't think he even realizes how much he inspired me and how much he taught me
[44:44.870 --> 44:48.470]  and how much I paid attention. People have called me many sub cool online before.
[44:48.870 --> 44:51.950]  Like it's been a joke for a little while, but we're similar. Uh,
[44:51.950 --> 44:55.550]  and Jenny says I'm quite like sub cool, which I think is funny. Anyhow,
[44:55.590 --> 44:58.270]  what I'm getting to you guys is sub cool.
[44:58.310 --> 45:02.950]  And miss Jill had a very nice home in California and the fires
[45:03.630 --> 45:07.190]  destroyed fucking everything. The wildfire in California,
[45:07.550 --> 45:11.950]  burned down their entire house. Um, so far at this point in time,
[45:12.390 --> 45:16.710]  sub does not know if the safe that they closed just before they left,
[45:16.710 --> 45:21.030]  they contained all of the TGA seeds that that safe could be destroyed.
[45:21.870 --> 45:24.510]  They don't know if that exists or not. They can't get back to their house.
[45:26.070 --> 45:29.310]  So this is ongoing guys. It's not something that happened already.
[45:29.310 --> 45:30.830]  It's something that's happening. Yeah.
[45:31.030 --> 45:33.750]  The house burned down a couple of nights ago. They're staying in a hotel.
[45:33.750 --> 45:37.350]  I don't know how much of it just subs putting it all on Instagram live.
[45:37.350 --> 45:39.190]  So this is all basically public info.
[45:39.390 --> 45:41.430]  And I want to send some love out to them is basically what I'm trying to do.
[45:41.430 --> 45:43.950]  I'm letting you guys know what's going on. If you've ever,
[45:44.390 --> 45:47.550]  so sub can't get to the house to find out if those seeds are even alive.
[45:47.670 --> 45:52.510]  You guys, the mother plants that TGA breeds with burned in the fire,
[45:52.830 --> 45:55.070]  all of their plants, their plants are gone.
[45:55.110 --> 45:59.550]  They cannot make strains like the void vortex. It's all gone. It's gone.
[45:59.670 --> 46:01.790]  The mother plants that did that, the male plant that did that,
[46:01.790 --> 46:03.030]  that shit doesn't exist anymore.
[46:03.030 --> 46:06.910]  So they're going to have to start from scratch unless one of their friends has a
[46:06.910 --> 46:09.670]  clone of the space dude, because that was what did it all.
[46:10.910 --> 46:14.670]  Sub and I were in talks of him sending me a space dude. That was coming.
[46:15.230 --> 46:17.510]  I was kind of, it just hasn't all evolved yet.
[46:17.550 --> 46:19.230]  We're going to do a collaboration together.
[46:19.470 --> 46:21.470]  There's going to be a space dude clone here. I would have it.
[46:21.510 --> 46:23.590]  I would have it to send back to him when he gets on his feet.
[46:23.950 --> 46:26.710]  It didn't happen yet. Fuck. Sometimes timing as a bitch.
[46:26.710 --> 46:30.790]  Sometimes nature is a bitch because if you've ever grown anything from sub cool,
[46:30.950 --> 46:35.910]  miss Jill, team green Avengers, if you've grown Dr. Who nine pound hammer vortex,
[46:35.910 --> 46:38.870]  space, queen, the void plush, Barry, there's so many strains at this.
[46:41.390 --> 46:42.390]  Agent orange.
[46:42.910 --> 46:47.390]  Uh, they're there. He's uh, what's the one I'm thinking of? Time rack blood.
[46:47.670 --> 46:48.710]  Uh, yeah, it's time rack.
[46:48.750 --> 46:52.830]  The list of the list of strains that came out of TGA is just intense.
[46:52.830 --> 46:55.470]  Jack and I've heard for so long. Yeah. Yeah.
[46:55.630 --> 46:57.950]  Sorry. You guys can hear me shaking up my water on the mic. Sorry.
[46:58.030 --> 47:01.110]  It's my emergency drink here. Uh, if you guys have grown any of that stuff,
[47:01.110 --> 47:05.750]  you guys owe a little nod toward TJ. At least if you can do anything,
[47:06.230 --> 47:10.590]  if all you can do is go to Instagram and message miss Jill, it's at.missatmiss.jill
[47:12.550 --> 47:16.310]  if you search for miss Jill with a Z you'll find there's no, I it's MZ.
[47:16.310 --> 47:20.070]  Jill send them words of encouragement. Jill's having a rough time with this. Uh,
[47:20.110 --> 47:22.830]  Jill's taking it worse than sub cool subs, a fucking soldier.
[47:23.190 --> 47:27.030]  Sub will not acknowledge that he's got feelings because he's a big manly man.
[47:27.230 --> 47:30.350]  Honestly, I would probably be playing the same fucking role as sub cool.
[47:30.470 --> 47:33.830]  He's powering forward and trying to work through it and not deal with it.
[47:34.390 --> 47:37.270]  And it's working for him. That's the way men deal with shit. I get that.
[47:37.270 --> 47:40.910]  Jill is not doing well. She's just got to feel her way through it. Yeah.
[47:41.030 --> 47:44.550]  And she's been in a, she's been in a hotel room for several days. Like guys,
[47:44.590 --> 47:47.430]  like I'm a guy I've got dreadlocks and I'm kind of, I'm not pretty.
[47:47.470 --> 47:49.230]  I can put on some shorts and some shoes at a time.
[47:49.230 --> 47:52.270]  I dreadlocks in a fucking giant knot and we can go do whatever needs to be done.
[47:52.510 --> 47:55.430]  Jill's a woman. She needs her woman thing. She needs clean clothes.
[47:55.430 --> 47:57.550]  She needs makeup and shit. She doesn't have any of that.
[47:57.550 --> 48:00.150]  It's not that they're poor, they can't get it. There's a house burned down.
[48:00.270 --> 48:02.070]  They're staying in a fucking hotel scraping by.
[48:02.110 --> 48:04.190]  Literally imagine if you went to dinner tonight,
[48:04.190 --> 48:07.750]  like you and whoever you run a Mickey D's and while you're gone,
[48:07.750 --> 48:10.470]  mother nature takes everything you own that you didn't have with you in the
[48:10.510 --> 48:11.470]  drive through. Yeah.
[48:11.470 --> 48:14.910]  Everything but your dog and the pipe that you took with you. Like, I mean,
[48:14.990 --> 48:17.750]  you know, the nature has just been brutal the last couple of months,
[48:17.750 --> 48:21.190]  but the fires in California are just the most recent. Yeah.
[48:21.230 --> 48:24.830]  So my point is that a fucking sub cool. Ms. Jill, I love you guys.
[48:25.430 --> 48:27.390]  Tok, the dog. Love you, bro.
[48:27.830 --> 48:32.470]  I hope team TGA recovers from this and I want to send huge love to one of my,
[48:32.590 --> 48:34.830]  my teachers. One of the guys that inspired me,
[48:34.830 --> 48:37.550]  one of the groups that taught me how to be the grower that I am.
[48:37.550 --> 48:41.910]  I wouldn't run a giant cultivation facility if I didn't follow the weed nerd so
[48:41.910 --> 48:45.830]  tightly for years. So shout out to those guys. I,
[48:46.150 --> 48:48.750]  I'm down to help however I can to get you guys back on your feet.
[48:48.750 --> 48:52.470]  If you listen to this, I would love to see you go in again. Stay strong, you guys.
[48:52.630 --> 48:55.710]  I don't want to watch you guys get depressed and crumble through this.
[48:56.110 --> 48:59.350]  Stay strong. You're badasses. You got a whole bunch of support behind you.
[48:59.710 --> 49:04.030]  The entire cannabis community, all the weed nerds. If you follow sub cool,
[49:04.030 --> 49:07.110]  you're known as a weed nerd subs, a weed nerd. He's the leader of the weed nerds.
[49:07.390 --> 49:09.110]  So all the nerds, we've got your back.
[49:09.430 --> 49:14.430]  I also shout out to everybody out there that's being fucking displaced and
[49:14.790 --> 49:18.590]  hampered and hindered and made miserable by all these fires.
[49:18.590 --> 49:21.230]  This is a terrible situation in California. It's miserable.
[49:21.230 --> 49:24.750]  Mendo dope is about to get burned down. Also, if you know anything about Mendo,
[49:24.750 --> 49:28.710]  these fires are headed right for the animal triangle right now. So, um,
[49:28.750 --> 49:30.310]  if they haven't already screwed with people,
[49:30.310 --> 49:35.310]  like they've completely just upturned sub goals world and that whole crew,
[49:35.630 --> 49:39.230]  um, they're headed for a lot of others. I mean, it's going to be a really,
[49:39.230 --> 49:42.110]  really, really awkward October, November, December this year.
[49:42.270 --> 49:44.550]  They've been saying there's too much cannabis in California.
[49:44.590 --> 49:45.790]  Do you think this will even it out?
[49:46.430 --> 49:50.630]  Between the mother nature, um, all over the place,
[49:50.670 --> 49:54.790]  the fires in Cali, the humidity and the moisture and the cold snap here.
[49:55.470 --> 49:58.830]  Um, pretty much anywhere you grow cannabis this year,
[49:58.830 --> 50:03.070]  whether fuck with you hard during your last couple of weeks of bloom, um,
[50:03.510 --> 50:07.110]  not going to fuck with the overall outdoor harvest this year, coast to coast.
[50:07.950 --> 50:12.710]  Um, they've also in the last like two weeks,
[50:12.710 --> 50:16.830]  they've busted, uh, three pretty large, um,
[50:16.870 --> 50:18.950]  illegal grows down here in Southern Colorado.
[50:18.950 --> 50:22.510]  They were doing the same thing in California. I saw somewhere in Oregon,
[50:22.510 --> 50:26.070]  they busted like the biggest one they've ever busted. It was thousands of plants.
[50:26.910 --> 50:29.190]  Um, I mean,
[50:29.190 --> 50:31.670]  there's been a lot going after the crop at the end of this year.
[50:32.190 --> 50:33.350]  Who knows what we're looking at?
[50:33.630 --> 50:35.790]  It's been a rough year for cannabis growers too much.
[50:35.790 --> 50:40.230]  There ain't no such thing as too much, never too much cannabis. You know, the,
[50:40.230 --> 50:42.870]  uh, the outdoor grows, they got busted here.
[50:42.870 --> 50:46.030]  We're all ran by cartels is what they're claiming.
[50:46.070 --> 50:50.270]  That's the headline, but they just say that. Okay. Um,
[50:50.590 --> 50:52.870]  if anybody at the gross speaks Spanish,
[50:52.870 --> 50:56.350]  it's a cartel grow until everyone's sentenced. Well, that's fucked up.
[50:56.630 --> 50:58.870]  It really is. Um, the latest one there,
[50:58.910 --> 51:02.150]  they're pimping with ties to Cuba.
[51:02.750 --> 51:07.150]  And I've read 50 different news stories on this Kabuki. Is that your crew?
[51:07.190 --> 51:07.750]  What are you doing?
[51:07.750 --> 51:12.790]  Every single article is just a word for word
[51:12.790 --> 51:17.790]  repeat of public County Sheriff's office, Facebook posts about the bust.
[51:18.350 --> 51:22.510]  They just, every news agency in Colorado, from the Denver post to the cannabis,
[51:22.510 --> 51:24.590]  to KOAA, to KKTV,
[51:25.030 --> 51:29.670]  all of them copy and paste the fucking Facebook post and call that reporting
[51:30.350 --> 51:32.310]  fucking lazy cocksucker journalists.
[51:32.430 --> 51:34.430]  Do you want to, I'm going to take a dab here.
[51:34.430 --> 51:37.750]  Do you want to tell them about the guy that shot the kids in his yard for
[51:37.750 --> 51:38.910]  stealing cannabis last year?
[51:38.990 --> 51:39.670]  Um, yeah,
[51:39.670 --> 51:44.350]  there was a dude in Denver who got his outdoor ripped by two
[51:44.350 --> 51:45.190]  teenagers,
[51:45.670 --> 51:49.310]  open fire while they were running away and he's headed to jail for 80 years,
[51:50.190 --> 51:51.310]  80 years.
[51:51.950 --> 51:53.590]  Did he kill one of them and wounded the other?
[51:53.630 --> 51:54.990]  Yep. Killed one wounded one.
[51:55.150 --> 51:57.790]  80 years for a cannabis plant. You guys don't shoot people.
[51:57.870 --> 51:59.910]  If somebody shoot people for your fucking weed.
[51:59.910 --> 52:02.910]  Yeah. Grow more next year. You guys plant, plant a couple extra.
[52:03.230 --> 52:07.430]  There are a lot of stupid rules in Colorado and Washington and Oregon and shit
[52:07.430 --> 52:09.150]  that you have to follow with legalization.
[52:09.510 --> 52:14.070]  But the one I don't mind so much is keep it the fuck locked up. Um,
[52:14.150 --> 52:15.470]  it's ripper season right now.
[52:15.470 --> 52:18.630]  I know two or three people that got ripped and are all wrecked right now because
[52:18.630 --> 52:22.750]  of they got ripped and they're mad and they're hunting down people and they're on
[52:22.750 --> 52:25.110]  the lookout for a fucking vehicle. And it's like, dude,
[52:25.630 --> 52:27.510]  I fucking told you to put it inside.
[52:27.590 --> 52:29.550]  And that I'm a cannabis grower.
[52:29.550 --> 52:32.230]  I was a cannabis grower before I should admit being a cannabis grower.
[52:32.230 --> 52:36.710]  I love cannabis, but that's the shit that is keeping it illegal in places.
[52:37.070 --> 52:41.550]  The fear of that. Yeah. You grow, you put these, they're valuable plants.
[52:41.550 --> 52:42.390]  You're putting,
[52:42.390 --> 52:46.190]  and you're just setting TVs out in the backyard basically.
[52:46.190 --> 52:48.950]  You know what I mean? Like motorcycles, motorcycles a little heavier.
[52:49.190 --> 52:52.830]  You wouldn't get a can of spray paint and spray paint on the front of your
[52:52.830 --> 52:57.470]  house. I've got 10 grand in cash in the back, poorly defended.
[52:57.550 --> 52:59.790]  Yeah. You're setting bags of money out there essentially.
[52:59.790 --> 53:04.990]  Yeah. I've got, I've got, I've got gold bars on my back patio just so everyone
[53:04.990 --> 53:06.710]  knows like you,
[53:06.710 --> 53:09.870]  you're putting a cannabis plant in your backyard that creates a smell.
[53:10.310 --> 53:15.310]  Every single teenager that walks by your house from early August to late October
[53:16.310 --> 53:20.830]  knows you're growing every Ripper that's driving up and down alleyways and
[53:20.830 --> 53:24.550]  neighborhoods with one dude sitting in the back of the pickup and one dude
[53:24.550 --> 53:27.950]  going up to the doors offering lawn service every now every couple of houses.
[53:27.950 --> 53:30.190]  So they don't look too shady all summer long.
[53:30.550 --> 53:33.390]  They've got a clipboard in the cab where they're marking down addresses with
[53:33.390 --> 53:34.790]  outdoor girls. They can smell.
[53:35.150 --> 53:37.750]  Then they come around in October and they clean your shit out.
[53:38.550 --> 53:40.870]  And it's the most predictable thing in the world.
[53:40.870 --> 53:44.350]  It's one of the main concerns everybody had under prohibition.
[53:44.950 --> 53:49.950]  You were worried about Rippers and cops in that order.
[53:50.790 --> 53:51.630]  Yup.
[53:51.910 --> 53:53.710]  And now it's legal and everybody's like,
[53:53.710 --> 53:55.670]  I don't have to worry about the cops.
[53:56.030 --> 53:59.790]  And they completely forgot that they were a secondary fucking concern 10 years
[53:59.790 --> 54:03.310]  ago. And the Rippers are your real problem.
[54:03.310 --> 54:06.230]  You don't want to bring that criminal element to your world.
[54:06.830 --> 54:08.510]  One dude, um,
[54:08.550 --> 54:10.230]  kind of over by where I used to live,
[54:10.590 --> 54:15.310]  got shot to death in his front yard because the three guys he brought in from
[54:15.310 --> 54:18.190]  Oklahoma to buy his crop that he couldn't move here,
[54:18.630 --> 54:20.950]  decided they'd rather shoot him and then pay for it.
[54:22.110 --> 54:24.630]  Like that's part of the beauty of legalizations.
[54:24.630 --> 54:26.790]  We don't have to mess with any of that shit anymore. People,
[54:26.830 --> 54:28.030]  you want to narrate my dab?
[54:28.910 --> 54:32.990]  Uh, it's a quarter gram or so going into the thermal banger.
[54:33.310 --> 54:37.750]  Um, with the hit man sidecar rig beneath it is a little too hot.
[54:37.750 --> 54:41.270]  Cause Jeff doesn't like cool dabs. Can't waste it.
[54:41.270 --> 54:46.190]  Folks q-tip taps for rich chumps below it or fancy
[54:46.190 --> 54:50.790]  girls. Tangy, platinum, tangy. Yeah. It tastes delicious.
[54:50.790 --> 54:52.390]  If you'd like a dab of that, I will pass this.
[54:54.390 --> 54:58.310]  Guess who grew that? Was that us? That was us over at three rivers.
[54:58.310 --> 55:02.710]  That's our grow extracted by our friends over at the craft. Delicious dab.
[55:02.990 --> 55:07.510]  Um, the high doesn't like destroy me, but it tastes real.
[55:07.510 --> 55:10.190]  It'd be a good breakfast. Dab. Good breakfast.
[55:10.190 --> 55:12.110]  I had the realization that outside of this show,
[55:12.110 --> 55:15.710]  I pretty much just dab at work. That's kind of a funny thing to say.
[55:16.150 --> 55:20.310]  That's kind of a funny thing to say. I just dabbed too high to fucking podcast.
[55:20.310 --> 55:24.030]  Correctly. Do you forget how to do this torch to fucking hit the microphone?
[55:24.030 --> 55:27.630]  I'm an unsafe. Are you sure you're going to be okay? I'm the nail.
[55:28.670 --> 55:30.830]  So how many people to butane,
[55:31.070 --> 55:34.630]  how many times slash people have tried to hit the microphone?
[55:34.630 --> 55:38.910]  Like it was the pipe. Like I'm doing. It was my favorite. Yeah, well, of course,
[55:38.910 --> 55:42.230]  but I've seen it happen a couple of times. The room was full when I did it.
[55:43.670 --> 55:45.630]  I'm coughing from my dad. You guys, I'll recover.
[55:47.710 --> 55:49.790]  Well, Mike, we've been going for nearly an hour here.
[55:49.870 --> 55:51.750]  I know you're heating up a dab and about to take a dab.
[55:51.750 --> 55:53.710]  And I want to ask you a question before you hit it.
[55:54.270 --> 55:57.470]  Since you've got a microphone and 5000 people listening,
[55:57.470 --> 55:58.470]  is there anything you want to say?
[55:58.470 --> 56:01.150]  Well, you got a microphone in your face and we start wrapping up the podcast.
[56:01.190 --> 56:03.310]  Thanks for listening, everybody.
[56:03.350 --> 56:04.830]  Shoot us some love on Twitter.
[56:04.830 --> 56:09.710]  It's at Nemo Punk 15 or at GFYH podcast. Yeah.
[56:10.550 --> 56:12.830]  We'd love to hear from you. Keep sending us emails.
[56:12.830 --> 56:14.910]  Those make by far the best shows at this point.
[56:14.990 --> 56:17.510]  Also support Mike's Facebook page.
[56:17.510 --> 56:19.590]  It's Pueblo for sensible cannabis.
[56:19.590 --> 56:21.910]  I've dude, I've been slacking for so hard on that.
[56:21.910 --> 56:25.230]  I I haven't been inspired, dude.
[56:25.230 --> 56:27.790]  I've been fucking tired since we started this new gig.
[56:28.030 --> 56:29.550]  Go inspire Mike. Between
[56:30.870 --> 56:33.150]  between the new job and the two year old, dude,
[56:33.150 --> 56:36.710]  I am just wrecked my expect you guys send him some encouragement.
[56:36.710 --> 56:38.990]  Not even on the show anymore. Guys, I'm so tired.
[56:39.070 --> 56:41.790]  Send him a power washer to wash the sand out of his vagina.
[56:41.950 --> 56:44.270]  It's it's kicking in.
[56:44.270 --> 56:48.070]  Prohibitionists are excited that Trump and Sessions are talking a lot of shit.
[56:48.990 --> 56:50.750]  And so they're coming out of the woodwork a little bit
[56:50.750 --> 56:53.510]  and saying a little more in public, which they kind of didn't do
[56:53.510 --> 56:55.950]  for the last eight years. They learned it not to.
[56:56.830 --> 56:59.230]  But they're kind of coming back in force
[56:59.230 --> 57:02.150]  and watching them talk at length makes me want to debunk.
[57:02.830 --> 57:04.310]  So it's what we like about you.
[57:04.310 --> 57:05.150]  Show me a little love.
[57:05.150 --> 57:07.510]  And that's all the encouragement I'll need to dive all the way back into it.
[57:07.510 --> 57:09.670]  Folks debunk Mike. Go do it.
[57:09.710 --> 57:12.310]  Go be Mr. Debunker. All right, you guys.
[57:12.550 --> 57:14.630]  I want to thank everybody for listening. Mike, I know you're taking a dab.
[57:14.630 --> 57:16.110]  But, dude, thanks for taking time out of your evening
[57:16.110 --> 57:17.950]  to come hang out and be on episode number 250.
[57:17.950 --> 57:20.190]  Happy to, brother. I'm glad to have you here. It was fun.
[57:20.190 --> 57:21.790]  Thanks for time. Take your time away from the kid.
[57:21.790 --> 57:23.910]  Don't worry. Just throw them throw that carb cap around.
[57:23.950 --> 57:26.270]  It's just glass. We'll get more from elevate.
[57:26.270 --> 57:28.710]  Do that bubble cap rolls. That's a safety feature.
[57:28.710 --> 57:31.590]  It is. It is. It just goes in circles and won't roll all the way off the table,
[57:31.590 --> 57:36.430]  though. You guys, if this is where I where I shamelessly tell you about my
[57:36.430 --> 57:40.670]  Patreon campaign, Patreon, if you feel like the podcast was worth a few bucks
[57:40.990 --> 57:43.710]  and you would like to contribute, all you have to do is go to a website
[57:43.710 --> 57:47.710]  called Patreon, check out Patreon dot com slash grow from your heart.
[57:47.870 --> 57:51.710]  Patreon will allow you as a listener to financially contribute to the podcast.
[57:51.990 --> 57:53.910]  No, I'm not trying to get rich off my podcast.
[57:53.910 --> 57:56.790]  However, I do have a proposition coming up for you in a future episode.
[57:57.710 --> 57:59.950]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[57:59.950 --> 58:02.110]  What patron will allow you to do is throw down a few dollars.
[58:02.270 --> 58:05.270]  It does cost me a few bucks to post to have a website.
[58:05.270 --> 58:09.030]  I host my podcast on a website on the IRIGENETICS Colorado website.
[58:09.030 --> 58:11.830]  Don't go there. It looks like shit and it's embarrassing, but it does exist.
[58:11.830 --> 58:13.350]  It's there. It needs a lot of love.
[58:13.350 --> 58:15.190]  It hasn't been touched up in quite a while.
[58:15.190 --> 58:16.830]  I'm not a web guy.
[58:16.830 --> 58:19.190]  Somebody reached out to me and we may do some work in the future,
[58:19.190 --> 58:21.310]  but that's not what the topic is right now.
[58:22.230 --> 58:24.190]  Anyway, I have to pay for that website to be there.
[58:24.310 --> 58:25.270]  That's how I host the show.
[58:25.270 --> 58:27.070]  That's how I give you the podcast for free.
[58:27.070 --> 58:29.030]  I will happily pay for it out of my pocket.
[58:29.030 --> 58:32.670]  If you think that you'd like to help out, send me a couple of bucks on the Patreon
[58:32.670 --> 58:34.510]  and that's what I will use the money for.
[58:34.510 --> 58:36.670]  Also, these little microphone covers that I'm scraping,
[58:36.670 --> 58:38.390]  it probably sounds like shit in your headphones.
[58:38.390 --> 58:39.190]  I keep freshies there.
[58:39.190 --> 58:42.150]  Mine smells like nothing, which is a real pleasant change sometimes.
[58:42.150 --> 58:43.310]  Yeah, because sometimes it can probably...
[58:43.310 --> 58:45.110]  You remember the orange one that was here for like a year?
[58:45.110 --> 58:48.270]  The one that Wade used to use on the old 719 podcast?
[58:48.270 --> 58:49.630]  That thing was here for like a year.
[58:49.630 --> 58:49.830]  Yeah.
[58:49.830 --> 58:51.270]  It smelled like homies mustache.
[58:51.270 --> 58:52.030]  Yeah, I bet it did.
[58:52.030 --> 58:52.670]  Unpleasant.
[58:52.670 --> 58:53.510]  I bet it did.
[58:53.510 --> 58:55.270]  Yep. So yeah, I replace those
[58:55.270 --> 58:58.070]  and then I throw fresh water bottles on the table and stuff like that.
[58:58.070 --> 58:59.470]  It's not free to do a podcast.
[58:59.470 --> 59:00.550]  I'll do it if I need to, you guys.
[59:00.550 --> 59:03.550]  I'm not begging, but if you want to help out, I'd totally appreciate it.
[59:03.550 --> 59:04.710]  That would help us all out.
[59:04.710 --> 59:07.430]  We're on like the 11th little box.
[59:07.430 --> 59:09.270]  The headphone jacks plug into guys.
[59:09.270 --> 59:10.070]  Yeah, those things break.
[59:10.070 --> 59:13.030]  We burn through gear here and not on purpose.
[59:13.030 --> 59:14.350]  It's not like we're doing anything crazy.
[59:14.350 --> 59:18.390]  The high speed Internet to upload the podcast is a little pricey, but whatever.
[59:18.390 --> 59:19.550]  250 episodes, brother.
[59:19.550 --> 59:20.510]  That's so huge.
[59:20.510 --> 59:21.350]  Thank you, man. Thank you.
[59:21.350 --> 59:23.190]  I'm not begging you guys.
[59:23.190 --> 59:25.670]  I burped as I said that I am not begging you guys,
[59:25.670 --> 59:27.790]  but if you'd like to throw down, I would truly appreciate it.
[59:27.790 --> 59:31.430]  Also, somebody just threw down four dollars and 20 cents on Patreon.
[59:31.510 --> 59:33.590]  You're making a four dollar and 20 cent contribution.
[59:33.750 --> 59:34.590]  That's cool as shit.
[59:34.590 --> 59:35.990]  Thank you. I appreciate that.
[59:35.990 --> 59:38.070]  Big thanks to everybody who has signed up on Patreon.
[59:38.630 --> 59:39.550]  That's a Mountain Dew.
[59:39.550 --> 59:41.790]  If anybody's wondering, Mike is caffeinated beverages.
[59:41.790 --> 59:42.910]  Mike has got an addiction.
[59:42.910 --> 59:43.790]  That is not a beer.
[59:43.790 --> 59:46.310]  It sounded like a beer a lot.
[59:46.310 --> 59:48.150]  Let's see what else.
[59:48.150 --> 59:51.070]  If you've got a product you'd like us to review or if you'd like to sponsor
[59:51.070 --> 59:53.830]  the show or if you've just got something you would like to say,
[59:54.030 --> 59:55.070]  you can reach out to me.
[59:55.070 --> 59:57.910]  It's grow from your heart at Hotmail dot com.

[01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:18.110]  Yeah. OK, I'm sorry.
[01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:19.110]  The number throws me off.
[01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:20.590]  I don't know why it's number 15.
[01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:23.510]  Also, if you want to stop, I was 15 when I came up with that.
[01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:24.510]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:25.790]  That's where that number came from.
[01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:27.590]  Wow. Fucking old.
[01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.710]  Wow. That is antiquity.
[01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:30.470]  I'm on Instagram.
[01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:32.270]  Older than some of our listeners, I bet.
[01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:33.150]  I bet it is.
[01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:35.070]  I wasn't going to go there.
[01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:40.750]  My my Instagram, you guys, I've got about 15000 Instagram followers.
[01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:42.550]  Check me out. I use my company name.
[01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:43.910]  It's IRI Genetics.
[01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:46.350]  I R I E underscore genetics.
[01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:47.670]  G E N E T I C S.
[01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:48.990]  I read genetics on Instagram.
[01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:50.030]  Check it out.
[01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:52.910]  If you're into cannabis photography and you want to see what I'm growing,
[01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:54.910]  what we're doing over at Three Rivers, if you want to see pictures
[01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:56.950]  of my breeding projects, if you just want to see
[01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:59.110]  what I think is high quality cannabis photography,
[01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:01.710]  I think you would appreciate my Instagram.
[01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:04.430]  Like I said earlier, the episodes are going up on YouTube.
[01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:08.470]  It takes me a lot of computer energy to put those up, but they're going up there.
[01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:10.430]  So check out the YouTube channel if you'd like to.
[01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:12.350]  I would appreciate that. Do it.
[01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:14.630]  It definitely don't follow me on Instagram.
[01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:17.870]  I almost never use that platform.
[01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:19.270]  I'm not good with it.
[01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:22.830]  Someone, one of the listeners, I actually I've been feeling a little guilty about this.
[01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:27.190]  So if you're listening now, know that somebody sent me a long message
[01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:30.390]  on Instagram asking about California law.
[01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:33.870]  I saw it while I was on break at work and glanced at it was like, oh,
[01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:38.430]  I need to to to check that out, research for a few minutes and get back to them.
[01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:42.550]  I can't figure out how to bring that bitch back up on Instagram, so
[01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:45.870]  please don't send me stuff through there because I will lose it
[01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:47.910]  and then feel guilty for months on end.
[01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:50.990]  But if that person is listening tonight, know that I've been feeling guilty
[01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:54.590]  slightly for months and send that question to me on another platform.
[01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:58.830]  I lost a folder of emails and there was one in there that I was like, oh, that's good.
[01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:01.510]  I want to do that on the show and I can't find the fucking folder.
[01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:02.550]  I did an update on my phone.
[01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:04.830]  I want to blame it on that, but I don't know where it went.
[01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:07.550]  I thought I screenshot it or something. Maybe.
[01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:10.670]  I don't know. But I told everybody I was like, hey, if you guys, if you sent me
[01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:13.790]  a really cool email and you feel like I haven't read it yet or a message
[01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:16.030]  and I haven't responded, fucking send it again, whatever.
[01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:19.790]  Annoy me. I only work if you keep on me, honestly.
[01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:23.430]  I got so much shit going on that the open mouth gets fed,
[01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:24.990]  I guess, is the way that goes.
[01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:28.230]  Yep. Yeah. So if you're quiet and you don't remind me, I might skip you.
[01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:29.150]  And it's nothing personal.
[01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:32.430]  It's just I'm doing 10,000 things and I might.
[01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:34.350]  I can't think for a thought.
[01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:37.270]  Yeah. Emails don't do much when they don't get answered.
[01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:39.190]  Plants do a lot when they don't get watered.
[01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:42.030]  Snap.
[01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:44.790]  No. Oh, shit. I didn't mean it that way.
[01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:47.830]  That's funny. It's just that's how our lives go, man.
[01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:49.950]  I've been playing that game for three days at work.
[01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:54.630]  Like I have twenty five things I want to do and need to do and would like to do.
[01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:57.870]  But I have to do the eight things that I have to do first.
[01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:02.590]  Yeah. Yeah. And being being the grow manager, it feels like I'll be like,
[01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:03.950]  all right, I got to do this. I got to do this.
[01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:05.190]  I got this guy working on this.
[01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:06.070]  This guy's working on this.
[01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:09.110]  Trim crew is kicking it. I'm going to put on some gloves, throw an earbud in.
[01:03:09.110 --> 01:03:10.390]  Now I'm going to run in here, start doing this.
[01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:11.950]  I'm going to mix up the water so that I can do this.
[01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:15.510]  As soon as I start filling the water container, the doorbell rings and I'm like,
[01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:18.270]  I'm going to ignore it and let somebody up front answer it and they'll handle it.
[01:03:18.350 --> 01:03:20.430]  And no, you motherfuckers always walk somebody right to me.
[01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:21.550]  Hey, Jeff, these guys need you.
[01:03:21.550 --> 01:03:23.990]  And I'm like, fuck, I was going to get work done today.
[01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:27.270]  There was a day that that was happening to me real bad.
[01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:31.230]  And for some reason, everyone that rang the doorbell, it wasn't ring.
[01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:34.550]  They'd get up on it. Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.
[01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:35.270]  Do you remember that day?
[01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:37.670]  Because I was screaming every time the doorbell rang.
[01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:40.870]  Some people, some people have learned that we have a grow and we'd like to play
[01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:42.830]  our music kind of fucking loud.
[01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:45.070]  And so some people, yeah, I know that guy didn't.
[01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:46.630]  But sometimes we've missed people.
[01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:49.190]  We've been in there and they're like, yeah, I sat here and listen to your music
[01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:51.350]  for like 30 minutes and I'm like, fuck, I'm sorry.
[01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:53.870]  Oops. Yeah.
[01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:55.710]  So did you like that reggae playlist?
[01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:56.310]  And that's Morgan.
[01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:00.430]  Do you like those harmonies?
[01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:02.870]  That's a family that's been singing together for 100 years.
[01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:06.270]  Yeah, it's just crazy busy.
[01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:09.990]  So if we've missed you in any way, just send that again.
[01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:13.510]  Holler, especially that person who sent me a message on Instagram.
[01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:15.110]  Like it seemed like a good question.
[01:04:15.110 --> 01:04:17.710]  It seemed like you cared a lot about getting the answer.
[01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:20.310]  I just only got a chance to glance at it.
[01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:22.310]  I only vaguely know what it was about.
[01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:24.550]  And then it disappeared into an app. I don't understand.
[01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:27.950]  I got a similar message from somebody asking me about Texas laws.
[01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:30.270]  And I don't know anything about Texas law.
[01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:32.310]  And I thought I should research that, but I didn't do it.
[01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:33.990]  And now it's lost in my Instagram messages.
[01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:35.390]  Texas law sucks.
[01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:37.910]  Well, unless you live in Austin and then it just sucks.
[01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:40.110]  Kind of. There you go.
[01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:40.510]  There you go.
[01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:42.750]  Listener who asked about Texas is what you get, I guess.
[01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:46.630]  No, Texas is one of the places that cops have been busted
[01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:49.990]  doing body cavity searches on the side of the fucking road
[01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:52.470]  because the cop is pretty sure he smells weed.
[01:04:55.030 --> 01:05:00.030]  They're also the place where if you make edibles with a concentrate,
[01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:03.470]  say, like you put a gram of shatter into a tray of brownies,
[01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:07.350]  they put that whole tray of brownies on the scale, fucking Pyrex dish
[01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:10.590]  included and say, you've got 30 pounds of concentrate,
[01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:13.110]  which they classify along the same lines as heroin.
[01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:16.390]  And so because you made hash brownies with actual hash,
[01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:20.670]  you get rung up like you had six kilos of heroin coming over the border.
[01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:22.390]  Don't mess with Texas.
[01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:25.350]  No, seriously. Texas is not the place to cannabis right now.
[01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:29.550]  Yeah, their laws are pretty brutal.
[01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:34.790]  There are a lot of cannabis refugees from Texas and Colorado.
[01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:36.390]  Yes, there sure are.
[01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:39.590]  Yep. All right, Mike, I'm coughing from a dab,
[01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:42.030]  but I think it's time to wrap up this podcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:45.990]  We we didn't mean to do it, but we say we throw a little informative nugget in.
[01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:48.590]  Right. We did it to him and we ended up doing it.
[01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:51.310]  I fucking ran of Texas. I love how Stoneworks.
[01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:53.510]  Two hundred and fifty episodes, you guys.
[01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:56.430]  When I started the podcast, I was like, thank you, bro. Thank you.
[01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:58.430]  When I started, I was like, maybe I can do 100 shows.
[01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:03.470]  I'd done nearly 100 episodes of another podcast with a friend
[01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:06.070]  and I was like, well, that wasn't that hard, but he did all the talking.
[01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:07.430]  I was the producer and co-host.
[01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:08.670]  I had to chime in.
[01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:12.550]  And honestly, I would sit here and wait for him to say some dumb shit
[01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:15.790]  so that I could just seeing him the best I could was what I did on that podcast.
[01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:18.070]  But I had a lot of practice.
[01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:19.870]  So it's like I can do 100 episodes and I got to 100.
[01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:21.510]  And I was like, that doesn't even feel like I'm started.
[01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:23.790]  It feels like I have a rhythm now.
[01:06:23.790 --> 01:06:27.710]  Honestly, on episode one hundred, I don't remember if it was while we were recording
[01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:32.110]  or right before or after someone was like, I can't believe you did 100.
[01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:34.590]  And you were like, yeah, we will do this again for 200.
[01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:36.390]  And we all kind of looked around the room.
[01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:38.630]  It was like, do you really think you're going to do this a hundred times?
[01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:39.390]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:41.430]  But I knew that there was that kind of look.
[01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:42.950]  And I was like, man, he's really on a roll.
[01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:45.790]  Some of these shows are really good.
[01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:47.350]  Some of them, I get it.
[01:06:47.350 --> 01:06:50.430]  Some of it we're rambling and talking, but man, it's a lot of work
[01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:51.350]  to put out this podcast.
[01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:52.470]  Sometimes we just got to play.
[01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:55.110]  Everybody has those days at work where it's like, I'm going to put my thumb
[01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:57.230]  in my butt and play with my phone all day at work and hide in the corner.
[01:06:57.830 --> 01:06:59.350]  Everybody has those days occasionally.
[01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:00.270]  Hopefully you don't have too many.
[01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:02.270]  But I mean, we did that on this show a few times.
[01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:06.510]  But you want now that I'm at 250, once I got to like 100, I was like, I do 250.
[01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:06.950]  No problem.
[01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:08.150]  I've got that weird OCD.
[01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:09.870]  Now, dude, the goal is 500 episodes.
[01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:12.590]  So, yeah, Rogan did a thousand recently.
[01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:14.030]  Oh, yeah.
[01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.470]  He's like a thousand and twenty or something by now.
[01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:20.310]  But he does three a week and eats fucking
[01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:23.510]  a bunch of alpha brain and drinks coffee, right?
[01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:26.790]  I don't know how that man talks so much.
[01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:28.750]  Got a good body mic to take Bohan with him.
[01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:31.270]  But a thousand episodes.
[01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:33.350]  We'll get to 500 and then we'll work on a thousand.
[01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:33.870]  Let's do it.
[01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:36.470]  You'll be here for it'll be even you're getting gray up there, bro.
[01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:38.150]  You'll be super gray by a thousand.
[01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:39.550]  Right. You notice an accent.
[01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:41.270]  Always have a hat on. Yeah, right now.
[01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:43.190]  Yeah, I've been going gray for a lot of years.
[01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.950]  It's coming in.
[01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:46.550]  There's plenty of salt in my pepper now, folks.
[01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:48.470]  I think we're going to wrap up the podcast with that one.
[01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:50.470]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for listening.
[01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:51.910]  It's been 250 episodes.
[01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:53.350]  I'm super proud. I'm super grateful.
[01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:54.470]  I'll be back.
[01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:57.510]  I'm probably going to put out a Thursday episode as well.
[01:07:58.310 --> 01:07:59.750]  Three episodes this week.
[01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:01.150]  You got to spoil the people.
[01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:02.510]  And got to give them what they want.
[01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:04.070]  Got to. Well, now it sounds like I promised it.
[01:08:04.070 --> 01:08:06.710]  So now we got to finish this.
[01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:08.510]  That's got to happen on that Thursday episode.
[01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:09.950]  Thursday shows are easy to make.
[01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:11.710]  I remember there's a prize
[01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:14.270]  for the person who I can identify who can identify.
[01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:15.030]  Oh, shit.
[01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:16.350]  Rasta Jeff in the house.
[01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:18.590]  And it's not me because I sounded just like that just now.
[01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:19.750]  It sounds just like that guy.
[01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:21.150]  Oh, shit. Rusty.
[01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:22.630]  There you go. It's that person.
[01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:23.750]  Identify that person.
[01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:27.430]  Also, there's a voice when the record spins backwards.
[01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:30.270]  There's a voice in there that goes backwards.
[01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:34.310]  And if you can identify whose voice that is, you get a prize.
[01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:37.790]  If you could tell me what they said, you get an even better prize.
[01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:39.230]  Depending on where you are, who you are.
[01:08:39.230 --> 01:08:40.510]  Tell me, John.
[01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:43.230]  No, man, it's not Chong, man.
[01:08:43.230 --> 01:08:46.470]  I still like a leavening cat.
[01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:48.950]  I'm going to I'm going to submit those answers officially, folks.
[01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:50.990]  They're taking cucumber boat wire.
[01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:54.270]  Anyway, Cumber boat, motherfucking wire.
[01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:58.430]  Yeah. Oh, for life.
[01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:01.990]  If you guys know what the fuck I'm talking about, you're down as fuck.
[01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:02.990]  Oh, all right.
[01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:05.430]  We're going to wrap up this podcast with a big old goofy grin on my face.
[01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:07.710]  I'm nice and stoned. My headache is gone.
[01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.910]  Shout out to the platinum Tangi shot as a mic for hanging out.

[01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:19.630]  is what I had intended.
[01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:22.190]  But it feels like this shout out should really go to some cool.

[01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:45.490]  There's nothing.
[01:10:45.490 --> 01:10:49.490]  Now, no one that could get to me, not even the damn system.
[01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:51.570]  So listen properly right now.
[01:10:51.570 --> 01:10:54.330]  I'm very un-terrained, living happily.

[01:10:57.370 --> 01:11:00.770]  The music I play and smoke my problems away.
[01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:04.810]  Me and a couple of my friends were just chilling on the corner
[01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:08.290]  listening to the music from Jamaica to Bahamas.
[01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:11.490]  Yeah, we decided to go link the farm.
[01:11:11.490 --> 01:11:13.370]  I need something for the brain.
[01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:15.410]  It's the marijuana.
[01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:20.090]  I'll be like when the good vibes start up, when the chanting starts,
[01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:24.490]  you get burned if you corrupt with smoke all day and still we got the herbs.
[01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:27.610]  I rub up, don't say Babylonia.

[01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:34.370]  We keep the meditation, music and more music.
[01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:36.050]  We burn the vagrants.
[01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:38.570]  No, if not, but no argument.
[01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:42.730]  Marijuana is my holy sacrament.
[01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:46.370]  I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:49.010]  Stay above the wicked and fly.

[01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:06.410]  Bless up this solace and we pass it around.
[01:12:06.610 --> 01:12:10.290]  And if I'm a bar myself, I don't smoke it alone.
[01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:12.050]  We got this phone to make it.
[01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:12.730]  Don't get me.
[01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:14.090]  Get back in Mexico.

[01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:35.410]  Sometimes the things I need in life may be difficult.
[01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:36.410]  Not all the time.
[01:12:36.410 --> 01:12:38.050]  It's going to be easy.
[01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:42.170]  So we smoke the marijuana and get high.
[01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:44.890]  Stay above the wicked and fly.
[01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:49.570]  I'm feeling so very good about myself.
[01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:51.210]  Pagans ain't feeling good.
[01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:52.890]  Well, that's the problem.

[01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:20.770]  I'm a big man and I put my problem behind me.
