[00:32.970 --> 00:34.410]  Here we go, podcast world.
[00:34.410 --> 00:35.410]  Welcome back.
[00:35.410 --> 00:36.410]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:36.410 --> 00:40.850]  This of course is episode 801 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:40.850 --> 00:41.850]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:41.850 --> 00:43.810]  I've got a fun episode lined up for us.
[00:43.810 --> 00:47.210]  In this episode, we're going to talk a little bit about whiteflies and we're going to talk
[00:47.210 --> 00:51.790]  a little bit about pollination and we're also going to give away free seeds.
[00:51.790 --> 00:52.790]  That's right.
[00:52.790 --> 00:57.530]  I've teamed up with our friends at seedsherenow.com to give away free iRegenetic seeds.
[00:57.530 --> 00:58.530]  Hang out.
[00:58.530 --> 01:00.890]  We'll talk more about the seed giveaway later in this episode.
[01:00.890 --> 01:04.410]  Before we get too far, I do want to send a big thank you for all of the comments, the
[01:04.410 --> 01:07.130]  love and support on episode 800.
[01:07.130 --> 01:08.130]  Thank you.
[01:08.130 --> 01:09.130]  That was a big milestone for me.
[01:09.130 --> 01:11.050]  I'm super proud to have made it that far.
[01:11.050 --> 01:13.970]  Thank you for all the compliments, the words of encouragement, all of the feedback.
[01:13.970 --> 01:15.210]  I do appreciate that.
[01:15.210 --> 01:16.210]  Cheers, you guys.
[01:16.210 --> 01:18.290]  We'll see you in another 800 episodes.
[01:18.290 --> 01:19.290]  Keep listening.
[01:19.290 --> 01:20.570]  There's no reason for me to stop.
[01:20.570 --> 01:21.970]  Can't stop, won't stop.
[01:21.970 --> 01:23.410]  Thanks again for all of the support.
[01:23.410 --> 01:28.450]  I also want to remind you that Team iRegenetics will be at the Dude Grows Cup, June 3rd in
[01:28.450 --> 01:31.370]  La Porte, Colorado, just outside of Fort Collins.
[01:31.370 --> 01:32.370]  That's right.
[01:32.370 --> 01:34.050]  Team iRegenetics will be at the Dude Grows Cup.
[01:34.050 --> 01:36.210]  Come hang out with us at the Dude Grows Cup.
[01:36.210 --> 01:37.210]  Give me a high five.
[01:37.210 --> 01:38.210]  Give me a fist bump.
[01:38.210 --> 01:39.210]  Take a selfie.
[01:39.210 --> 01:40.450]  Grab some seeds if you need them.
[01:40.450 --> 01:44.610]  I look forward to seeing you at the Dude Grows Cup, June 3rd in La Porte, Colorado.
[01:44.610 --> 01:48.970]  Of course, all the information is at dgccup.com.
[01:48.970 --> 01:53.930]  If you can't make it to the DGC Cup, make sure you check out my website, iRedirect.com.
[01:53.930 --> 01:58.890]  There will be a fresh restock and a new drop on iRedirect.com.

[02:37.170 --> 02:38.970]  slash growfromyourheart.
[02:38.970 --> 02:43.450]  Ladies and gentlemen, go check iRedirect now because a lot of the things will sell out
[02:43.450 --> 02:44.450]  very quickly.
[02:44.450 --> 02:45.450]  All right.
[02:45.450 --> 02:48.290]  I think that is all of the business part we've got here at the start of the show.
[02:48.290 --> 02:52.290]  Let's jump into your favorite part of the podcast, the listener email portion of the
[02:52.290 --> 02:53.290]  show.
[02:53.290 --> 02:55.310]  We've got a bunch of great emails here in front of me.
[02:55.310 --> 02:58.430]  The first question here in front of me came from our friend Shannon.
[02:58.430 --> 03:02.710]  This one did come from the Grow Help tab on the iRegenetics website.
[03:02.710 --> 03:03.710]  That's right.
[03:03.710 --> 03:07.010]  If you go to iRegenetics.com, there are a bunch of tabs at the top.
[03:07.010 --> 03:09.290]  One of them says questions or help.
[03:09.290 --> 03:10.370]  Click on that tab.
[03:10.370 --> 03:12.930]  You'll be able to answer a few preliminary questions.
[03:12.930 --> 03:15.010]  We ask, what kind of question do you have?
[03:15.010 --> 03:16.010]  Where are you growing?
[03:16.010 --> 03:17.010]  What kind of lights?
[03:17.010 --> 03:18.850]  What stage are you in veg or flower?
[03:18.850 --> 03:20.050]  What week are you in?
[03:20.050 --> 03:23.690]  We ask a few questions just to help me answer your question a little bit more clearly.
[03:23.690 --> 03:24.970]  I get some details.
[03:24.970 --> 03:26.770]  This one came from our friend Shannon.
[03:26.770 --> 03:30.210]  We can skip all of the preliminary questions that were answered because these don't really
[03:30.210 --> 03:31.210]  affect my answer.
[03:31.210 --> 03:34.850]  I do understand this question and I do have a good solution.
[03:34.850 --> 03:39.290]  Our friend Shannon says, Rasta Jeff, I think I have a problem with whiteflies and I've
[03:40.290 --> 03:45.090]  such, but I am wondering if there's anything that can be mistaken for whiteflies?
[03:45.090 --> 03:46.530]  That's a really good question.
[03:46.530 --> 03:50.770]  It does go on to say, however, I do know the difference between fungus gnats and whiteflies.
[03:50.770 --> 03:55.170]  It is definitely not fungus gnats because I have done a podcast recently in the past
[03:55.170 --> 03:57.810]  trying to talk about fungus gnats and whiteflies.
[03:57.810 --> 03:58.890]  We're trying to treat for both.
[03:58.890 --> 04:02.270]  I said it's very important to identify the pest which you are attacking.
[04:02.270 --> 04:04.110]  That way we can attack properly.
[04:04.110 --> 04:06.050]  So they do know that it is not fungus gnats.
[04:06.050 --> 04:07.290]  There's a big difference there.
[04:07.290 --> 04:11.570]  It also says, also I've become quite a fan and I appreciate your work and efforts in
[04:11.570 --> 04:12.850]  the pot world.
[04:12.850 --> 04:16.290]  The first episode I ever saw was number 713 about mother plants.
[04:16.290 --> 04:18.010]  Well, I'm glad you discovered the podcast.
[04:18.010 --> 04:19.070]  I'm glad you're watching.
[04:19.070 --> 04:20.070]  Thank you for joining us.
[04:20.070 --> 04:23.050]  Thank you for learning and extra thanks for the great question here because this is a
[04:23.050 --> 04:25.410]  great topic to talk about here on the show.
[04:25.410 --> 04:27.370]  It says, PS, you can use my name too.
[04:27.370 --> 04:29.930]  I'm digging your work from Canada.
[04:29.930 --> 04:32.210]  So big shout out to our friend Shannon from Canada.
[04:32.210 --> 04:33.890]  Thank you for the great question.
[04:33.890 --> 04:37.270]  It sounds like you do know the difference between fungus gnats and whiteflies.
[04:37.270 --> 04:41.550]  There are not a lot of other things that will be confused or look like whiteflies.
[04:41.550 --> 04:45.150]  Sometimes an aphid can look like a whitefly, but here is the main difference.
[04:45.150 --> 04:46.750]  Aphids do not fly.
[04:46.750 --> 04:49.590]  The main difference is that these whiteflies are going to fly.
[04:49.590 --> 04:54.070]  If you take something, your hand, your arm, or maybe a stick and you hit the plants, do
[04:54.070 --> 04:58.070]  little white things come flying up and out of the plant that look like ashes?
[04:58.070 --> 04:59.790]  If so, those are whiteflies.
[04:59.790 --> 05:01.670]  They look like a little piece of rice.
[05:01.670 --> 05:03.990]  They look like an ash and they fly around in the grow.
[05:03.990 --> 05:05.870]  They fly around a lot.
[05:05.870 --> 05:09.390]  Now if we have definitely identified that those are whiteflies, let's talk a little
[05:09.390 --> 05:14.310]  bit about treatment because just identifying them is only the start of the mission.
[05:14.310 --> 05:15.470]  Let me talk about one thing here.
[05:15.470 --> 05:19.870]  A friend of mine was facing whiteflies and he said, I put yellow sticky traps all over
[05:19.870 --> 05:21.950]  the room, but it is not working.
[05:21.950 --> 05:22.950]  Absolutely.
[05:22.950 --> 05:26.210]  Yellow sticky traps are not meant to eradicate a pest.
[05:26.210 --> 05:30.190]  Yellow sticky traps are there to indicate the presence of a pest.
[05:30.190 --> 05:33.630]  Those yellow sticky traps should be yellow and pest free.
[05:33.630 --> 05:35.510]  Maybe one day you'll see a couple of bugs on there.
[05:36.150 --> 05:38.790]  You'll go, Hey, there's something in here I need to pay attention.
[05:38.790 --> 05:39.910]  Mark down how many you saw.
[05:39.910 --> 05:40.910]  Make a mental note.
[05:40.910 --> 05:45.950]  There were about 10 of these specific bugs on this yellow sticky trap yesterday morning.
[05:45.950 --> 05:46.950]  Pay attention.
[05:46.950 --> 05:48.410]  How many there are there in the evening?
[05:48.410 --> 05:49.850]  How many are there tomorrow morning?
[05:49.850 --> 05:51.590]  How many are there the next day?
[05:51.590 --> 05:52.590]  Are a couple landing?
[05:52.590 --> 05:55.670]  You're going to get a couple of bugs stuck to your yellow sticky trap, but if you've
[05:55.670 --> 06:02.150]  got 10 the first day, 50 the next day, 150 the next day, we've got an increasing problem.
[06:02.150 --> 06:03.430]  It is time to do something.
[06:03.430 --> 06:07.190]  Those yellow sticky cards are only indicators of the presence of pests.
[06:07.190 --> 06:11.230]  They're not there to eradicate, eliminate, or minimize a pest infestation.
[06:11.230 --> 06:14.930]  Anyway, that is to let you know, Hey, there's bugs here, bro.
[06:14.930 --> 06:17.790]  That's like having some footsteps in the snow is all that those guys are.
[06:17.790 --> 06:20.510]  So let's start by identifying the white flies.
[06:20.510 --> 06:21.510]  We know they're there.
[06:21.510 --> 06:23.150]  We've seen them on the yellow sticky traps.
[06:23.150 --> 06:25.830]  Now let's talk about ways to eradicate these white flies.
[06:25.830 --> 06:28.650]  The first thing I would do is defoliate.
[06:28.650 --> 06:30.310]  The white flies are on the leaves.
[06:30.310 --> 06:31.310]  Let's take off the leaves.
[06:31.310 --> 06:34.350]  Any big leaf you don't need any leaf with a purple petiole.
[06:34.350 --> 06:35.750]  Let's get that leaf right out of there.
[06:35.750 --> 06:37.470]  Let's strip the plants, clean it up.
[06:37.470 --> 06:41.190]  Let's put all of those leaves into a sealed container and get that as far from the grow
[06:41.190 --> 06:42.190]  as possible.
[06:42.190 --> 06:45.990]  If you could burn that shit, that would be ideal, but I understand that is not possible
[06:45.990 --> 06:47.150]  for everybody.
[06:47.150 --> 06:48.670]  Don't just go throw it in the backyard.
[06:48.670 --> 06:50.430]  Don't throw that bag of leaves in the basement.
[06:50.430 --> 06:52.150]  Don't just abandon that bag.
[06:52.150 --> 06:53.430]  That bag is contaminated.
[06:53.430 --> 06:58.230]  Let's get that shit far, far from our ganja plants, far, far from the grow.
[06:58.230 --> 07:01.130]  Then also once you're done doing that, change clothes, clean up.
[07:01.130 --> 07:04.930]  Let's not take a bunch of white flies right back into the grow after we just did work.
[07:04.930 --> 07:09.610]  Step number one, let's heavily defoliate any plant that is affected by the white flies
[07:09.610 --> 07:14.450]  and also consider defoliating the other plants that may not be as heavily affected.
[07:14.450 --> 07:16.030]  Let's minimize the opportunities.
[07:16.030 --> 07:17.830]  Let's take away their hangout spots.
[07:17.830 --> 07:20.290]  Let's not leave a lot of opportunities for them to go.
[07:20.290 --> 07:23.250]  So the first thing we want to do is do some defoliation.
[07:23.250 --> 07:25.330]  So the next thing I would do is kind of a wild idea.
[07:25.330 --> 07:26.930]  It's super fun to watch somebody do this.
[07:26.930 --> 07:30.290]  If you've got a buddy that can get you on camera, record this, post it, tag me.
[07:30.290 --> 07:31.730]  It will be really funny.
[07:31.730 --> 07:32.970]  This sounds wild, but I do this.
[07:32.970 --> 07:33.970]  I have done this.
[07:33.970 --> 07:35.450]  This is how I get rid of white flies.
[07:35.450 --> 07:37.130]  I haven't had white flies in a long time.
[07:37.130 --> 07:38.130]  I have done this.
[07:38.130 --> 07:40.610]  There's actually video somewhere on Instagram of me doing this.
[07:40.610 --> 07:43.330]  I get a long stick, whatever kind of long stick you've got.
[07:43.330 --> 07:45.890]  A couple of feet long is what I needed for my grow space.
[07:45.890 --> 07:49.490]  I also got a shop vac with a long wand on it.
[07:49.490 --> 07:51.450]  That way I can control where I'm pointing.
[07:51.450 --> 07:53.130]  You guys may be able to see where I'm going with this.
[07:53.130 --> 07:54.410]  I turn on the shop vac.
[07:54.410 --> 07:57.810]  I start smacking the plants with the stick and then I hold the shop vac up toward the
[07:57.810 --> 07:58.810]  light.
[07:58.810 --> 07:59.810]  Guess what?
[08:00.330 --> 08:01.450]  As soon as the plants fly out of the plant, they head up to the light.
[08:01.450 --> 08:03.170]  Then guess what?
[08:03.170 --> 08:05.290]  Right into the shop vac and they're gone.
[08:05.290 --> 08:07.490]  Sometimes I'll kind of wave that shop vac around the canopy.
[08:07.490 --> 08:09.730]  Be careful not to suck up plant matter.
[08:09.730 --> 08:10.850]  Don't get leaves stuck in there.
[08:10.850 --> 08:11.850]  Keep it moving.
[08:11.850 --> 08:12.850]  Be careful about it.
[08:12.850 --> 08:16.330]  Just kind of feather across the top of the plants, brother, and you will suck up a lot
[08:16.330 --> 08:17.330]  of those white flies.
[08:17.330 --> 08:18.330]  Keep tapping.
[08:18.330 --> 08:19.330]  They'll keep flying.
[08:19.330 --> 08:20.330]  Give them a minute to settle.
[08:20.330 --> 08:21.330]  Watch where they land.
[08:21.330 --> 08:25.010]  Get the vacuum kind of near there again and then tap them and they'll go flying right
[08:25.010 --> 08:26.210]  into the vacuum.
[08:26.210 --> 08:27.930]  This is very effective.
[08:27.930 --> 08:30.170]  Make sure that you've got a vacuum with a filter in it.
[08:30.170 --> 08:33.810]  Some of the shop vacs will shoot those white flies right out of the other end of the shop
[08:33.810 --> 08:36.350]  vac and just shoot them into your other grow space.
[08:36.350 --> 08:37.350]  Don't do that.
[08:37.350 --> 08:38.350]  Have a filter on there.
[08:38.350 --> 08:41.930]  Have some sort of way to catch those white flies once they're sucked into your shop vac.
[08:41.930 --> 08:44.850]  If you don't have a shop vac, a normal house vacuum will work.
[08:44.850 --> 08:48.150]  Put that attachment on it to where the one you use to clean the curtains or the corners
[08:48.150 --> 08:49.150]  or whatever.
[08:49.150 --> 08:50.490]  Put that attachment on there.
[08:50.490 --> 08:52.330]  Get in there and suck up those white flies.
[08:52.330 --> 08:53.690]  So now we have defoliated.
[08:53.690 --> 08:55.550]  We've taken away most of their home.
[08:55.590 --> 08:58.390]  Now we have also shop vac'd them, which was kind of an assassination.
[08:58.390 --> 09:00.390]  We went in there and just got rid of most of them.
[09:00.390 --> 09:01.390]  We took out a lot of them.
[09:01.390 --> 09:03.750]  There are still going to be a few stragglers.
[09:03.750 --> 09:05.590]  People are going to hang out.
[09:05.590 --> 09:11.390]  Let's talk about spray applications that I would recommend to help minimize and eradicate
[09:11.390 --> 09:12.990]  this white fly infestation.
[09:12.990 --> 09:16.070]  The first product I'm going to recommend is Evergreen.
[09:16.070 --> 09:17.270]  Evergreen is a great product.
[09:17.270 --> 09:19.230]  It's a pyrethrin based product.
[09:19.230 --> 09:22.510]  The reason Evergreen is going to work very well for the white flies is because they like
[09:22.510 --> 09:24.910]  to congregate on the bottoms of the leaves.
[09:24.950 --> 09:28.430]  If you spray the Evergreen on the underside of the leaves, you'll be sticky.
[09:28.430 --> 09:32.790]  You'll be an undesirable habitat, an undesirable environment for the white flies.
[09:32.790 --> 09:34.550]  They simply won't want to be there.
[09:34.550 --> 09:35.990]  Also it's toxic to them.
[09:35.990 --> 09:37.190]  They're not going to want to hang out.
[09:37.190 --> 09:39.190]  So get the undersides of your leaves.
[09:39.190 --> 09:41.350]  When you apply the pesticide, get it.
[09:41.350 --> 09:47.790]  I'm going to recommend somewhere between 15 and 30 milliliters of Evergreen per gallon
[09:47.790 --> 09:49.550]  of water in a pump sprayer.
[09:49.550 --> 09:52.070]  Shake the shit out of it and apply that to your plants.
[09:52.110 --> 09:56.190]  When you spray it, start at the bottom of the plant and work your way up and make sure
[09:56.190 --> 09:58.510]  to spray the undersides of the leaves.
[09:58.510 --> 10:02.030]  And since we're dealing with white flies, also spray the main stalk and the stalks if
[10:02.030 --> 10:03.250]  you can.
[10:03.250 --> 10:06.850]  What this is going to do, you need to spray the bottom of the leaves because that is where
[10:06.850 --> 10:08.710]  the pests hang out the most.
[10:08.710 --> 10:10.470]  Start at the bottom and work your way up.
[10:10.470 --> 10:12.430]  This way we know that we're coating the entire plant.
[10:12.430 --> 10:14.630]  We're getting everything covered in pesticide.
[10:14.630 --> 10:18.310]  And by starting at the bottom, you spray it, start at the bottom and it doesn't drip from
[10:18.310 --> 10:19.310]  the top to the bottom.
[10:19.310 --> 10:22.630]  You can actually work your way up and you can see where you've applied a pesticide.
[10:22.630 --> 10:26.070]  You can make it more effective that way by starting at the bottom and get the undersides
[10:26.070 --> 10:28.310]  of the leaves is very important.
[10:28.310 --> 10:30.830]  So I would start off with an Evergreen spray.
[10:30.830 --> 10:34.870]  Then if that didn't work or if that is not available to you, the spray product from Mammoth
[10:34.870 --> 10:37.590]  Bio-Control, the Mammoth Pesticide Spray.
[10:37.590 --> 10:38.590]  I cannot think of the name.
[10:38.590 --> 10:39.590]  I think I wrote it down.
[10:39.590 --> 10:40.590]  What's it called?
[10:40.590 --> 10:42.910]  Mammoth Canna Control is a great product.
[10:42.910 --> 10:44.830]  That will work for your white flies.
[10:44.830 --> 10:49.190]  One thing we're going to have to do, we're going to have to spray every third day until
[10:50.070 --> 10:51.070]  these white flies are gone.
[10:51.070 --> 10:52.070]  You have to be persistent.
[10:52.070 --> 10:53.870]  They're not going to go away on the first application.
[10:53.870 --> 10:57.870]  We'll defoliate, we'll shop vac, we'll get rid of a nice percentage.
[10:57.870 --> 11:01.310]  Then our first application of Evergreen should get rid of a lot of them.
[11:01.310 --> 11:02.310]  There should be a few stragglers.
[11:02.310 --> 11:05.390]  There are going to be eggs, there are going to be babies, they're going to reproduce.
[11:05.390 --> 11:06.390]  We got to kill them.
[11:06.390 --> 11:08.750]  It's going to take a couple of sprays.
[11:08.750 --> 11:10.950]  First spray I would go for is Evergreen.
[11:10.950 --> 11:12.750]  Then in three days, I would rotate.
[11:12.750 --> 11:14.550]  I would use the, what is it called?
[11:14.550 --> 11:17.110]  The Mammoth Canna Control if that's available to you.
[11:17.110 --> 11:20.290]  If not, go right back in with that Evergreen and spray that again.
[11:20.290 --> 11:21.290]  That will get rid of them.
[11:21.290 --> 11:26.110]  Also, Botanigard Max is another great product to put into the rotation here.
[11:26.110 --> 11:30.790]  Now let's talk about some more gentle and simpler products that we can use to eradicate
[11:30.790 --> 11:32.270]  the white flies.
[11:32.270 --> 11:37.110]  Something that works very good, very well in my opinion, is a product known as Mosquito
[11:37.110 --> 11:38.110]  Dunks.
[11:38.110 --> 11:42.550]  They are sold at most places that sell anything to do with plants or gardening.
[11:42.550 --> 11:46.810]  All of your big box stores, your Lowe's, your Home Depot, whatever's in your neighborhood,
[11:46.810 --> 11:48.090]  they will have Mosquito Dunks.
[11:48.090 --> 11:50.010]  You can also get them at Target.
[11:50.010 --> 11:54.410]  If you can get them at a mom and pop hardware shop in your area, we always recommend that.
[11:54.410 --> 11:56.390]  Go spend your money in your community.
[11:56.390 --> 11:58.250]  Don't give it to the big corporate box store.
[11:58.250 --> 11:59.610]  But they got all the shit.
[11:59.610 --> 12:00.610]  That's why we go there.
[12:00.610 --> 12:02.650]  So I guarantee that those stores will have it.
[12:02.650 --> 12:04.310]  They're called Mosquito Dunks.
[12:04.310 --> 12:07.170]  They're sold on a red card and they look like little donuts.
[12:07.170 --> 12:09.770]  I think there's about six donuts in the package.
[12:09.770 --> 12:12.210]  There could be three, three to six donuts in the package.
[12:12.210 --> 12:16.570]  They look like a little, like a donut or a hamster lick or a bird feed or something like
[12:16.610 --> 12:17.610]  that.
[12:17.610 --> 12:18.610]  Don't eat it.
[12:18.610 --> 12:19.610]  Don't lick it.
[12:19.610 --> 12:20.610]  Don't feed it to your pets.
[12:20.610 --> 12:21.610]  We're going to use this to kill white flies.
[12:21.610 --> 12:27.130]  What I recommend you do with this, I put it in a baggie, a thick baggie, not like a sandwich
[12:27.130 --> 12:28.290]  baggie, a dope baggie.
[12:28.290 --> 12:29.810]  I use a gallon Ziploc bag.
[12:29.810 --> 12:30.810]  It's kind of thicker.
[12:30.810 --> 12:32.290]  Then I wrap that in newspaper.
[12:32.290 --> 12:34.810]  Then I use a mallet to crush up the Mosquito Dunk.
[12:34.810 --> 12:36.690]  I want it into small bits.
[12:36.690 --> 12:40.010]  Then it will take those small bits and put that directly into water.
[12:40.010 --> 12:41.010]  I'll stir it up.
[12:41.010 --> 12:42.010]  I'll let it sit.
[12:42.010 --> 12:44.170]  I'll let that Mosquito Dunk kind of break up.
[12:44.170 --> 12:46.450]  After a while, it just starts to fall apart like a turd in the water.
[12:47.330 --> 12:48.330]  It'll just come apart.
[12:48.330 --> 12:49.970]  It'll become flaky and disintegrate in there.
[12:49.970 --> 12:51.930]  Then I'll get a stick and I'll stir it up.
[12:51.930 --> 12:53.650]  Then I'll add my other nutrients to the mix.
[12:53.650 --> 12:57.810]  I might just put my nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, molybdenum.
[12:57.810 --> 12:58.850]  I'll throw it all in there.
[12:58.850 --> 13:02.810]  Whatever I'm feeding might just go right into this mix right along with my Mosquito Dunks.
[13:02.810 --> 13:07.410]  Then I will water that into the soil and that will definitely help get rid of all of those
[13:07.410 --> 13:08.410]  white flies.
[13:08.410 --> 13:10.010]  They will not want to go back into the soil.
[13:10.010 --> 13:12.610]  So at this point, we've defoliated, we've shop vac'd.
[13:12.610 --> 13:13.730]  Now we've sprayed the leaves.
[13:13.730 --> 13:16.210]  The leaves are now undesirable for these white flies.
[13:16.210 --> 13:20.290]  We've also drenched our soil with the Mosquito Dunks, which has got a beneficial bacteria
[13:20.290 --> 13:21.290]  in there.
[13:21.290 --> 13:23.770]  That product will work very well to help get rid of the white flies.
[13:23.770 --> 13:25.330]  It's very cost effective.
[13:25.330 --> 13:27.610]  It's very affordable and very effective.
[13:27.610 --> 13:32.650]  Also another product that will work very good for your white flies is Monterey Garden Spray.
[13:32.650 --> 13:36.250]  Monterey Garden Spray contains a bacteria called Spinosad.
[13:36.250 --> 13:41.290]  Spinosad is very effective against most pests that we're going to encounter in our cannabis
[13:41.290 --> 13:42.290]  grows.
[13:42.850 --> 13:46.010]  Let's recap a little bit because I feel like I gave you a lot of information and I also
[13:46.010 --> 13:48.910]  feel like I'm going super duper fast.
[13:48.910 --> 13:52.450]  The first thing I would do, defoliate, get rid of the leaves.
[13:52.450 --> 13:56.270]  If there are no hotel rooms, there's nowhere to stay, the bugs will leave.
[13:56.270 --> 13:57.810]  Then hit them with the shop vac.
[13:57.810 --> 14:01.610]  Tap the plants, shop vac those little fuckers as they come flying out.
[14:01.610 --> 14:03.590]  Then hit them with the pesticide.
[14:03.590 --> 14:06.430]  Then maybe also get in there and hit them with the shop vac again.
[14:06.430 --> 14:08.210]  If you've got time, why not?
[14:08.210 --> 14:09.670]  Shop vac the shit out of them.
[14:09.670 --> 14:12.430]  Then in three days, hit them with the pesticide.
[14:12.430 --> 14:15.910]  Also the first time you hit them with that pesticide, give them a soil drench from those
[14:15.910 --> 14:17.350]  mosquito dunks.
[14:17.350 --> 14:21.230]  Now we've taken away their hotels, we've made it undesirable.
[14:21.230 --> 14:25.070]  We've shop vac the shit out of them to eradicate most of the population.
[14:25.070 --> 14:28.870]  Now we're spraying a pesticide to make the leaves undesirable and we're also drenching
[14:28.870 --> 14:29.870]  the soil.
[14:29.870 --> 14:31.350]  There's nowhere for the white flies to go.
[14:31.350 --> 14:32.750]  They're going to get the fuck out of there.
[14:32.750 --> 14:36.370]  Now our other option, if you are opposed to spraying a pesticide or maybe you're too late
[14:36.370 --> 14:40.930]  in the flower and you don't want to do that, the other option of course is to release predator
[14:40.930 --> 14:41.930]  bugs.
[14:41.930 --> 14:44.690]  The predator bugs will come in and eradicate those white flies.
[14:44.690 --> 14:49.490]  And if you do choose to go the beneficial insect route, I definitely recommend green
[14:49.490 --> 14:52.090]  lace wings to get rid of the white flies.
[14:52.090 --> 14:57.810]  Also there is another predator mite called the swirky, the swirky, I want to say swirky,
[14:57.810 --> 15:01.530]  S-W-I-R-R-K-Y, very close to that.
[15:01.530 --> 15:05.410]  That guy will definitely get in there and eradicate those white flies.
[15:05.450 --> 15:08.130]  The swirky, those guys do thrive in warm environments.
[15:08.130 --> 15:11.990]  So if you've got a hot grow space, which you probably do, which is probably contributing
[15:11.990 --> 15:16.850]  to the white flies, the swirky, A. swirky, those bad motherfuckers will get in there
[15:16.850 --> 15:18.370]  and eat the shit out of your white flies.
[15:18.370 --> 15:22.450]  Of course, my first recommendation is the green lace wings.
[15:22.450 --> 15:26.930]  And if you do release their lace wings, I may go for the live lace wings that are active
[15:26.930 --> 15:29.570]  already because you've got a white fly infestation.
[15:29.570 --> 15:31.250]  Any other time I recommend the cards.
[15:31.250 --> 15:34.970]  I like when they hatch, the eggs come on the cards, they hatch, they turn into these little
[15:34.970 --> 15:39.570]  dinosaur alligators and those things are super hungry and they're interesting to watch.
[15:39.570 --> 15:40.850]  Most of the time, that's what I recommend.
[15:40.850 --> 15:45.110]  I may go for straight for the living lace wings at this point just to eradicate these
[15:45.110 --> 15:46.110]  white flies.
[15:46.110 --> 15:48.170]  That's what I would use to eliminate these white flies.
[15:48.170 --> 15:51.050]  White flies are not a huge problem, but they can become a huge problem.
[15:51.050 --> 15:52.570]  They carry more pests.
[15:52.570 --> 15:56.050]  If you've got a small problem, the white flies will compound every problem.
[15:56.050 --> 15:59.370]  And if you've got a problem with one plant, the white flies will definitely move that
[15:59.370 --> 16:02.330]  problem to all of your plants.
[16:02.370 --> 16:06.490]  Now I do understand a lot of us will be in different phases of the cannabis production.
[16:06.490 --> 16:10.830]  We may be in veg, we may be in early flower, mid flower or late flower.
[16:10.830 --> 16:11.970]  That does make a big difference.
[16:11.970 --> 16:16.110]  Of course, later in flower, that's when I recommend those beneficial insects.
[16:16.110 --> 16:21.570]  In veg, early flower, that's when I will recommend the evergreen or the, what else was the other
[16:21.570 --> 16:27.170]  one that I said, the Botanicard Max or the Botanicard WP, which has also got the Bavaria
[16:27.170 --> 16:30.970]  Bassiana in there, which will be very effective against the white flies.
[16:30.970 --> 16:32.970]  So early in flower, I would go with the evergreen.
[16:32.970 --> 16:36.050]  I would go with the Mammoth Canna Control Spray.
[16:36.050 --> 16:40.650]  Later in flower, I may go with the Botanicard Max products, the Botanicard products, because
[16:40.650 --> 16:41.650]  they don't have oils.
[16:41.650 --> 16:46.290]  They're focusing more on the beneficial bacteria and the fungus, which is in that product.
[16:46.290 --> 16:48.170]  And I would rather smoke that than the oils.
[16:48.170 --> 16:54.050]  Honestly, it's going to have a less detrimental effect on flavor and less detrimental effect
[16:54.050 --> 16:55.530]  on the final product.
[16:55.530 --> 16:57.410]  Those beneficial bacterias will dissipate.
[16:57.410 --> 16:59.210]  They'll get destroyed by the air.
[16:59.210 --> 17:01.170]  They'll get destroyed by the wind and the light.
[17:01.170 --> 17:02.410]  Those oils are going to stay there.
[17:02.410 --> 17:05.090]  They're going to taste terrible in your final product.
[17:05.090 --> 17:07.770]  So I would recommend something like the Botanicard Max.
[17:07.770 --> 17:11.570]  Of course, if you have to go late in flower, I never recommend spraying late in flower,
[17:11.570 --> 17:14.810]  but sometimes you've got to do what you have got to do.
[17:14.810 --> 17:19.570]  If the white flies are not destroying your garden later in flower, maybe ride it out,
[17:19.570 --> 17:21.610]  unless of course you've got a perpetual cycle.
[17:21.610 --> 17:23.010]  That's always something to think about.
[17:23.010 --> 17:26.630]  But earlier in the phase, I would go with evergreen.
[17:26.630 --> 17:30.630]  As it gets a little bit later, I would work my way into the Botanicard and the Bavaria
[17:30.630 --> 17:34.230]  bossiana beneficial bacterias as my defense.
[17:34.230 --> 17:35.230]  All right.
[17:35.230 --> 17:36.230]  I think I've covered this question.
[17:36.230 --> 17:39.070]  The main question was, can I identify that they are white flies?
[17:39.070 --> 17:43.390]  I don't have a picture, but if they fly around like ashes, if they look like little just
[17:43.390 --> 17:46.110]  white bugs flying around, that's a white fly, bro.
[17:46.110 --> 17:47.830]  We've got to treat for the white flies.
[17:47.830 --> 17:50.510]  All right, my friend Shannon, thank you for the great content.
[17:50.510 --> 17:53.510]  I do want to remind you that you win a free pack of seeds.

[18:08.430 --> 18:10.070]  Big shout out to seedsherenow.com.
[18:10.070 --> 18:15.430]  Shannon, please do send me your real name for the shipping box and an address to ship
[18:15.430 --> 18:17.110]  these seeds out to you.
[18:17.110 --> 18:18.430]  I appreciate your support.
[18:18.430 --> 18:19.430]  All right.
[18:19.430 --> 18:21.670]  I've got another great question here in front of me.
[18:21.670 --> 18:25.610]  This one also came from the Grow Help tab on iReed Genetics.
[18:25.610 --> 18:28.950]  This one came from our friend Flacid Jack.
[18:28.950 --> 18:29.950]  That's an interesting name.
[18:29.950 --> 18:30.950]  Let's keep it moving.
[18:30.950 --> 18:35.190]  It says, Rasta Jeff, I just discovered your podcast and I love it.
[18:35.190 --> 18:36.190]  Thank you for listening, bro.
[18:36.190 --> 18:38.150]  There's a lot of episodes to go catch up on.
[18:38.150 --> 18:42.150]  So head back toward the back of the catalog and start listening and listen to all of the
[18:42.150 --> 18:43.150]  episodes.
[18:43.150 --> 18:45.510]  Can't wait to see what you think about some of the older content.
[18:45.510 --> 18:49.290]  It says you've got more actual Grow Talk than most podcasts.
[18:49.290 --> 18:50.290]  Thank you.
[18:50.290 --> 18:51.290]  I know I do get rambly.
[18:51.910 --> 18:54.450]  I cut out the shout outs at the start of the show because I noticed that was throwing people
[18:54.450 --> 18:56.290]  off and people wouldn't listen.
[18:56.290 --> 18:58.730]  But I try to stay focused and talk about cannabis cultivation.
[18:58.730 --> 19:01.730]  I don't try to overload you with commercials and shit to buy.
[19:01.730 --> 19:05.210]  Of course I want you to buy my seeds, but we covered that at the start of the show.
[19:05.210 --> 19:07.170]  There's no reason to keep rambling about that.
[19:07.170 --> 19:11.010]  And I also feel like when you have a problem in a grow, I don't need to sell you a product.
[19:11.010 --> 19:14.410]  I need to give you, of course I just told you things to spray on your shit for the last
[19:14.410 --> 19:16.750]  problem, but I'm not sponsored by those companies.
[19:16.750 --> 19:17.750]  They don't pay me.
[19:17.750 --> 19:19.970]  Nobody gave me any money to recommend those products.
[19:20.050 --> 19:22.850]  I recommend them because they work and that's what matters.
[19:22.850 --> 19:25.810]  I want you to grow the best cannabis you can grow.
[19:25.810 --> 19:29.850]  I've got this gift of I can read something and comprehend it and put it to use.
[19:29.850 --> 19:35.410]  And I feel like I can repeat and regurgitate things that I've read and my experiences in
[19:35.410 --> 19:38.010]  an educational way that everybody can follow along.
[19:38.010 --> 19:41.450]  So thanks for thinking there's more Grow Talk than most other shows.
[19:41.450 --> 19:44.470]  I'm not paid to advertise anything but seeds here now.
[19:44.470 --> 19:48.530]  And of course I try to advertise my own seed line because that's what I'm going to do.
[19:48.530 --> 19:49.590]  But, but you're right.
[19:49.710 --> 19:53.030]  Let's stay focused and get to more actual Grow Talk.
[19:53.030 --> 19:57.190]  It says recently I started some autos which I've saved to make seeds.
[19:57.190 --> 19:58.710]  So you've got some auto flowers going.
[19:58.710 --> 19:59.710]  That is fun.
[19:59.710 --> 20:04.230]  I'm not an auto flower grower or a breeder, but more power to everybody out there working
[20:04.230 --> 20:05.230]  with auto flowers.
[20:05.230 --> 20:09.950]  There's a seed and a plant for everybody and a grower for every seed is how I feel.
[20:09.950 --> 20:11.130]  It does go on.
[20:11.130 --> 20:14.110]  It says I saved one seed from each pack to do this.
[20:14.110 --> 20:17.590]  I'm wondering if you have any experience using colloidal silver.
[20:17.590 --> 20:19.910]  No, I do not use colloidal silver.
[20:19.910 --> 20:24.170]  I strongly, heavily, highly prefer silver thiosulfate.
[20:24.170 --> 20:25.170]  It's much more effective.
[20:25.170 --> 20:26.930]  It works much better on the plants.
[20:26.930 --> 20:31.270]  It doesn't take as many spray applications and I think it's less stressful overall to
[20:31.270 --> 20:32.270]  the plant.
[20:32.270 --> 20:33.670]  So I don't use colloidal silver.
[20:33.670 --> 20:39.150]  I make my own silver thiosulfate, which I've done a full podcast on making STS.
[20:39.150 --> 20:42.290]  It's called My STS Mix or something like that.
[20:42.290 --> 20:43.290]  You can watch that episode.
[20:43.290 --> 20:45.710]  I'll put a link in the video description.
[20:45.710 --> 20:46.710]  Then it goes on.
[20:46.710 --> 20:49.990]  You only want to herm one branch and not the whole plant.
[20:49.990 --> 20:52.230]  Let me drop this paper and talk about this.
[20:52.230 --> 20:56.510]  If that plant is a herm in any way, you do not want to breed with it.
[20:56.510 --> 20:57.510]  Let me explain this.
[20:57.510 --> 21:03.150]  When we're making feminized seeds, there is no hermaphrodite, no intersex.
[21:03.150 --> 21:06.070]  That word does not exist when it comes to making fem seeds.
[21:06.070 --> 21:11.110]  If you are working with a plant that is a herm, a hermaphrodite, an intersex plant,
[21:11.110 --> 21:14.550]  you are going to have a failure of a feminized project.
[21:14.550 --> 21:16.950]  I know I'm being very critical, but I want to make this clear.
[21:16.950 --> 21:22.470]  A lot of people think that fem seeds have some sort of intersex or hermaphrodite trait
[21:22.470 --> 21:24.070]  or gene or magic to them.
[21:24.070 --> 21:25.750]  That is very untrue.
[21:25.750 --> 21:27.270]  Let me explain this.
[21:27.270 --> 21:30.630]  When I make feminized seeds, I make a lot of fem seeds.
[21:30.630 --> 21:32.230]  I sell a lot of fem seeds.
[21:32.230 --> 21:34.150]  You guys grow my fem seeds.
[21:34.150 --> 21:35.930]  You're very satisfied with them.
[21:35.930 --> 21:37.910]  That tells me that I'm doing it right.
[21:37.910 --> 21:39.950]  So here's what I'm doing.
[21:39.950 --> 21:44.990]  Before I use a plant to make fem seeds or any seeds with it, I grow that plant and I
[21:44.990 --> 21:48.270]  purposefully stress the shit out of that plant.
[21:48.270 --> 21:53.310]  I want to cause that plant problems and turmoil because I want to see how it reacts under
[21:53.310 --> 21:54.310]  pressure.
[21:54.310 --> 21:59.230]  If the plants that I'm growing with show me intersex traits, hermaphroditism, what else
[21:59.230 --> 22:00.230]  did you call it?
[22:00.230 --> 22:01.870]  Hermes is the other word I saw today.
[22:01.870 --> 22:06.710]  If the plant is intersex in any way, it does not get used in a breeding project because
[22:06.710 --> 22:11.910]  that intersex trait will carry through into my breeding and you guys do not deserve or
[22:11.910 --> 22:14.150]  want intersex plants in your garden.
[22:14.150 --> 22:15.830]  So I eliminate those.
[22:15.830 --> 22:21.350]  The female plants I'm using in my feminized projects are stress tested to a rigorous level.
[22:21.350 --> 22:23.110]  They are not intersex.
[22:23.110 --> 22:26.930]  What I am doing is spraying the plants with silver thiosulfate.
[22:26.930 --> 22:31.430]  What is happening is the thiosulfate is helping the silver enter the plant and get into the
[22:31.430 --> 22:32.970]  plant system.
[22:32.970 --> 22:36.430]  That silver then disrupts the copper movement in the plant.
[22:36.430 --> 22:41.750]  That plant then has an ethylene reaction which causes it to produce anthers which contain
[22:41.750 --> 22:43.670]  only female pollen.
[22:43.670 --> 22:44.670]  Here's an important part.
[22:44.670 --> 22:49.910]  The pollen is only female pollen because that plant is only a female.
[22:49.910 --> 22:51.110]  It is not intersex.
[22:51.110 --> 22:52.110]  It is not a boy.
[22:52.110 --> 22:55.110]  It is 100% a female.
[22:55.110 --> 22:58.550]  So I'm taking a female plant and I'm doing science to it.
[22:58.550 --> 23:00.270]  Science magic and nature all meet.
[23:00.270 --> 23:02.090]  I treat it with the chemical.
[23:02.090 --> 23:06.650]  That plant then creates pollen sacs which only contain female pollen.
[23:06.650 --> 23:07.770]  There's no male.
[23:07.770 --> 23:08.850]  There's no intersex.
[23:08.850 --> 23:10.370]  There's no hermaphrodite.
[23:10.370 --> 23:13.050]  Those words are not involved at all.
[23:13.050 --> 23:17.650]  Then I use that female pollen from that tried, trued, tested female plant that's been reversed
[23:17.650 --> 23:21.250]  and I put that on another tried, trued, and tested female.
[23:21.250 --> 23:22.610]  Maybe the same female.
[23:22.610 --> 23:26.410]  Maybe a clone of the same female and we make fem seeds.
[23:26.410 --> 23:31.570]  So that is my rant and my disclaimer to get me started here to talk about your fem seed
[23:31.650 --> 23:34.810]  Now let's talk a little bit more about what you actually asked.
[23:34.810 --> 23:39.310]  Now for the sake of this conversation, I am going to replace the word herm with reverse
[23:39.310 --> 23:41.250]  because that is what we are attempting to do.
[23:41.250 --> 23:43.050]  We want to reverse a plant.
[23:43.050 --> 23:47.370]  We want to turn it from a female into a pollen donating female plant.
[23:47.370 --> 23:49.170]  That is what we call reversing it.
[23:49.170 --> 23:50.490]  So let's talk about that.
[23:50.490 --> 23:53.250]  I only want to reverse is what we're going to say.
[23:53.250 --> 23:54.250]  So now it goes on.
[23:54.250 --> 23:59.570]  It says, I only want to reverse one branch of each plant, not the entire plant.
[23:59.570 --> 24:03.130]  I'm not crossing, just pollinating the plants themselves.
[24:03.130 --> 24:04.290]  Any advice would be awesome.
[24:04.290 --> 24:07.650]  If you already have an episode discussing this, I will check it out.
[24:07.650 --> 24:11.250]  I probably have done a full episode talking about this, but we're here.
[24:11.250 --> 24:12.610]  Let's talk about this.
[24:12.610 --> 24:16.130]  The first thing that got my attention is it sounds like you've got multiple plants you
[24:16.130 --> 24:17.490]  want to work with.
[24:17.490 --> 24:24.550]  I highly, very highly recommend you only mess with one reversal at a time.
[24:24.550 --> 24:26.010]  Pollen is microscopic.
[24:26.010 --> 24:27.490]  Pollen can travel.
[24:27.490 --> 24:30.850]  Pollen can get from one reversed plant over to the other reversed plant.
[24:30.850 --> 24:34.010]  And then we've got what I call a Maury Povich situation.
[24:34.010 --> 24:35.170]  Who is the baby daddy?
[24:35.170 --> 24:37.330]  Was it this plant or was it this plant?
[24:37.330 --> 24:38.330]  We're never going to know.
[24:38.330 --> 24:41.890]  So what I recommend is only one reversal at a time.
[24:41.890 --> 24:43.090]  Don't mess this project up.
[24:43.090 --> 24:44.970]  We want to know what you've made.
[24:44.970 --> 24:47.090]  You want to self this plant is what you want to do.
[24:47.090 --> 24:49.610]  You want to take, let me read and make sure.
[24:49.610 --> 24:50.610]  Yes.
[24:50.610 --> 24:53.050]  So you've got, let's just say you've got, this doesn't exist.
[24:53.050 --> 24:54.210]  Don't get excited.
[24:54.210 --> 24:56.690]  Let's say you've got golden goat auto flower plants.
[24:56.690 --> 24:59.290]  You want to make golden goat auto flower plants.
[24:59.290 --> 25:02.410]  What I would do now, I did also just come up with another catch in my mind.
[25:02.410 --> 25:07.330]  I'm not familiar with breeding with auto flowers, so I'm not exactly how this is going to work.
[25:07.330 --> 25:11.410]  But in your scenario, if you want to self this plant, which is what you're doing, you're
[25:11.410 --> 25:15.890]  taking a hypothetically a golden goat auto flower and you want to make more golden goat
[25:15.890 --> 25:17.450]  auto flowers.
[25:17.450 --> 25:21.810]  Since you've only got the one plant, you've got to reverse part of that plant and pollinate
[25:21.810 --> 25:26.290]  the other branch of that plant with the same pollen on the same plant.
[25:26.890 --> 25:31.730]  Otherwise you've got to get more seeds and put pollen from that plant onto another plant.
[25:31.730 --> 25:36.130]  But because you can't cut clones from the auto flowers, I'm a little bit confused when
[25:36.130 --> 25:39.370]  it comes to breeding with autos because I don't ever do this.
[25:39.370 --> 25:44.130]  Normally you would take one auto, reverse it, pollinate autos, other autos, and that
[25:44.130 --> 25:47.050]  way you've got that pollen donor and you can just pollinate all the others.
[25:47.050 --> 25:50.730]  You don't have to worry about cloning anything, but you've only got the one plant.
[25:50.730 --> 25:55.890]  So you're going to have to reverse one branch or half of the plant and then take that pollen
[25:55.930 --> 25:58.850]  and carefully apply it to the rest of the plant.
[25:58.850 --> 26:01.410]  Yes, that should work in theory.
[26:01.410 --> 26:03.170]  Notice I did say should.
[26:03.170 --> 26:05.290]  Let's talk about what happens.
[26:05.290 --> 26:10.090]  Sometimes when you attempt to reverse a plant, you will spray just a couple of branches to
[26:10.090 --> 26:11.090]  do what you're trying to do.
[26:11.090 --> 26:14.270]  Get some pollen from one side to pollinate the rest.
[26:14.270 --> 26:16.290]  Sometimes that works.
[26:16.290 --> 26:17.290]  Sometimes it's perfect.
[26:17.290 --> 26:20.450]  Other times the plant does not want to reverse.
[26:20.450 --> 26:24.450]  The hormones in that plant are so stubborn that when you treat these few branches, the
[26:24.450 --> 26:27.770]  hormones from the other part of the plant go, nah, we're not going to let it reverse.
[26:27.770 --> 26:32.610]  It's just so dominant or so powerful and who that plant is that you're not going to change
[26:32.610 --> 26:33.610]  it.
[26:33.610 --> 26:35.050]  Then other times we get the opposite.
[26:35.050 --> 26:39.970]  You try to reverse this one branch and the plant's just got those hormones and it goes,
[26:39.970 --> 26:42.530]  watch me, and the whole fucking plant reverses.
[26:42.530 --> 26:44.210]  So you've got three options.
[26:44.210 --> 26:45.250]  It may work beautifully.
[26:45.250 --> 26:50.170]  You may spray a couple of branches and isolate those and spray those and those will pollinate
[26:50.170 --> 26:52.730]  and you may be able to pollinate the rest of the plant.
[26:52.730 --> 26:56.650]  Or when you reverse that one side, the entire plant could reverse.
[26:56.650 --> 26:59.450]  Or when you go to reverse that one side, nothing could happen.
[26:59.450 --> 27:02.090]  So you've got three potential outcomes here.
[27:02.090 --> 27:05.610]  Like I said, normally if you're working with the autoflowers, you would reverse one full
[27:05.610 --> 27:09.130]  plant and then use that as your pollen donor for multiple females.
[27:09.130 --> 27:10.630]  So that's going to be the catch here.
[27:10.630 --> 27:14.490]  And like I said, I'm not an autoflower breeder, so this is the closest I can get you with
[27:14.490 --> 27:16.730]  my experience with what I know.
[27:16.730 --> 27:20.370]  What I would recommend, what you're going to have to do probably to reach the goal you
[27:20.370 --> 27:26.410]  want is grow that plant, reverse it, reverse one side and pollinate that other side of
[27:26.410 --> 27:28.490]  that plant with that plant.
[27:28.490 --> 27:29.690]  There's going to be a lot of obstacles.
[27:29.690 --> 27:31.370]  I don't know the timing of that.
[27:31.370 --> 27:34.650]  Most of the time I know I trigger the flowering phase.
[27:34.650 --> 27:39.890]  I spray the plant before flower and then I can spray it at certain times during flower
[27:39.890 --> 27:44.010]  unless you know how long that plant veggies or how tall it gets before it goes into flower.
[27:44.010 --> 27:47.810]  It's going to be hard to anticipate when to start spraying unless you spray immediately
[27:47.970 --> 27:52.130]  when you see pre-flowers or right when it goes into flower, but it's going to be a little
[27:52.130 --> 27:53.130]  bit challenging.
[27:53.130 --> 27:58.370]  Your question and your plan will work, but you're going to have some obstacles.
[27:58.370 --> 28:01.730]  Number one, I recommend doing these two plants separately.
[28:01.730 --> 28:04.370]  The next catch is that you're working with the autoflowers.
[28:04.370 --> 28:07.570]  You get one shot per seed at this because you cannot clone it.
[28:07.570 --> 28:12.690]  So you've got to grow it, reverse half of it and successfully pollinate the other side.
[28:12.690 --> 28:13.690]  You get one shot.
[28:13.690 --> 28:17.170]  You get two shots, but man, I hope this works out for you.
[28:17.210 --> 28:18.690]  Let me make sure I'm answering the question here.
[28:18.690 --> 28:23.210]  I want to reverse only one branch, not the whole plant, not crossing, just pollinating
[28:23.210 --> 28:24.210]  themselves.
[28:24.210 --> 28:25.210]  That should work.
[28:25.210 --> 28:26.530]  That is the way to do that.
[28:26.530 --> 28:27.530]  That should work.
[28:27.530 --> 28:29.930]  But like I said, you got three options for outcomes.
[28:29.930 --> 28:32.010]  Any advice would be awesome if you already have.
[28:32.010 --> 28:34.770]  I've done an episode similar to this, but it is not about autoflowers.
[28:34.770 --> 28:37.730]  So there's a lot of new caveats and obstacles in here.
[28:37.730 --> 28:39.650]  I hope I've answered your question.
[28:39.650 --> 28:40.650]  Let me give the disclaimer.
[28:40.650 --> 28:42.570]  I'm not an autoflower grower or breeder.
[28:42.970 --> 28:47.490]  I'm just talking about the experience I understand from photo period breeding.
[28:47.490 --> 28:51.890]  The hardest part is going to be the timing, in my opinion, knowing when to start spraying.
[28:51.890 --> 28:57.210]  If you use the silver thiosulfate, you've got to spray it one time about a week before
[28:57.210 --> 29:01.570]  flower and then day one of flower, which how do you determine that with an autoflower?
[29:01.570 --> 29:02.570]  Just kind of keep an eye on it.
[29:02.570 --> 29:04.750]  And I guess you get to decide when that happens, right?
[29:04.750 --> 29:11.010]  But you got to spray it the day one, day three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18, and 21.
[29:11.010 --> 29:12.890]  It's going to be challenging to time that.
[29:12.890 --> 29:14.130]  There is another spray out there.
[29:14.130 --> 29:15.290]  I cannot think of the name of it.
[29:15.290 --> 29:20.850]  I have not tried it, but they claim that you can spray a plant one time and it will reverse
[29:20.850 --> 29:21.850]  the plant.
[29:21.850 --> 29:23.710]  So maybe that's something worth looking into.
[29:23.710 --> 29:28.490]  It is quite expensive, but if it does what you need done, I've never thought of an instance
[29:28.490 --> 29:30.730]  where that spray would be worth the money.
[29:30.730 --> 29:33.410]  Suddenly, this may be the appropriate application.
[29:33.410 --> 29:36.410]  All right, MyDudeFlacidJack.
[29:36.410 --> 29:37.410]  That's a great name.
[29:37.410 --> 29:39.250]  I hope you're able to solve the flacid problem.
[29:39.490 --> 29:42.770]  I hope I helped you out making some autoflower seeds.
[29:42.770 --> 29:46.930]  If you've got follow-up questions, dude, please do reach out because like I said, I'm not
[29:46.930 --> 29:48.310]  an autoflower breeder.
[29:48.310 --> 29:50.930]  So there are some things I'm going to miss in this question.
[29:50.930 --> 29:55.050]  If anybody out there has some feedback, any updates, any details, please leave it in the
[29:55.050 --> 30:00.130]  YouTube comments or send me an email at growfromyourheart.com.
[30:00.130 --> 30:03.810]  And FlacidJack, please do send me your address because guess what?
[30:03.810 --> 30:06.410]  I owe you a free pack of iRegenetic seeds.
[30:06.410 --> 30:07.410]  That's right.
[30:07.410 --> 30:08.690]  I read your message here on the show.
[30:08.690 --> 30:13.250]  It's here now and I would be happy to send you a free pack of iRegenetic seeds.
[30:13.250 --> 30:14.250]  Please shoot me your address.
[30:14.250 --> 30:18.130]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you did not win a free pack of seeds on today's episode, don't
[30:18.130 --> 30:19.130]  feel left out.
[30:19.130 --> 30:20.130]  Don't feel discouraged.
[30:20.130 --> 30:23.610]  I've got a lot of emails here in front of me and there are a lot more podcast episodes
[30:23.610 --> 30:24.610]  coming.
[30:24.610 --> 30:26.610]  Simply stay tuned, keep hanging out, keep tuning in.
[30:26.610 --> 30:29.730]  Maybe you'll win free seeds on a future episode.
[30:29.730 --> 30:31.690]  That is all the questions I've got for today's episode.
[30:31.690 --> 30:34.350]  I feel like I rambled on quite a bit on today's show.
[30:34.350 --> 30:35.350]  Thank you for hanging out.
[30:35.350 --> 30:36.370]  Thank you for listening.
[30:36.370 --> 30:39.490]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments or concerns, you know I would love to hear
[30:39.490 --> 30:40.490]  from you.
[30:40.490 --> 30:43.730]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[30:43.730 --> 30:44.730]  Don't be shy.
[30:44.730 --> 30:48.850]  Of course, if you have cultivation or cannabis culture questions, send those to the GrowHelp
[30:48.850 --> 30:49.850]  tab.
[30:49.850 --> 30:52.130]  Go to my website, iRegenetics.com.
[30:52.130 --> 30:53.610]  Click on the GrowHelp tab.
[30:53.610 --> 30:54.610]  Send me your questions.
[30:54.610 --> 30:56.330]  I will read that on the air and guess what?
[30:56.330 --> 30:57.830]  You'll win free seeds.
[30:57.830 --> 31:00.010]  Don't forget about that new drop coming to iRedirect.
[31:00.010 --> 31:02.590]  It should be live by the time this episode comes out.
[31:02.590 --> 31:05.070]  Go scoop some new shit at iRedirect.com.
[31:05.070 --> 31:09.950]  There will be Orangegasm, Lemon Jeffrey, Golden Goat, Bubble Goat, Chemical Cocktail,
[31:09.950 --> 31:11.830]  and a whole bunch of other great shit.
[31:11.830 --> 31:12.830]  What's the other one I forgot about?
[31:12.830 --> 31:14.150]  I can't even remember right now.
[31:14.150 --> 31:15.670]  So many on my mind.
[31:15.670 --> 31:16.670]  It's up there.
[31:16.670 --> 31:17.670]  Go get you some.
[31:17.670 --> 31:19.950]  There might even be some new shit if you're quick enough.
[31:19.950 --> 31:24.870]  Make sure you check out the Patreon campaign at patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[31:24.870 --> 31:25.870]  Support the show.
[31:25.870 --> 31:30.110]  Of course, all the Patreon members do get the first heads up when things drop.
[31:30.110 --> 31:33.830]  Sometimes they even get cool coupon codes and free shipping.
[31:33.830 --> 31:35.590]  Let's wrap this podcast up, everybody.
[31:35.590 --> 31:36.590]  Thanks again for hanging out.
[31:36.590 --> 31:38.390]  I'll be back in a week with fresh new content.
[31:38.390 --> 31:42.430]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy Totally Dave.
[31:42.430 --> 31:45.830]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
