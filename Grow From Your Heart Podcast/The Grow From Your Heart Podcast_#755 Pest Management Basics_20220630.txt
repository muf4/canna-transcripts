[00:07.550 --> 00:09.050]  All right, here we go.
[00:09.050 --> 00:10.830]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:10.830 --> 00:13.210]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:13.210 --> 00:18.210]  This is episode 755 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:18.370 --> 00:19.990]  In this episode, we're going to talk about
[00:19.990 --> 00:21.830]  integrated pest management.
[00:21.830 --> 00:23.570]  Before I get to that part of the show,
[00:23.570 --> 00:26.090]  let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks
[00:26.090 --> 00:29.410]  who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:29.410 --> 00:32.010]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast
[00:32.010 --> 00:34.410]  thank you shout out to my friend Quazi.
[00:34.410 --> 00:35.530]  Let's send a big thank you shout out
[00:35.530 --> 00:37.130]  to Spherical Glassworks.
[00:37.130 --> 00:39.930]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to G7.
[00:39.930 --> 00:41.330]  I want to send a big thank you shout out
[00:41.330 --> 00:44.250]  to one of my favorite testers, my buddy Levity Loveday.
[00:44.250 --> 00:46.530]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Kes Burton.
[00:46.530 --> 00:47.450]  Let's send a thank you shout out
[00:47.450 --> 00:50.610]  to the hardest working man in cannabis, my buddy James Brown.
[00:50.610 --> 00:52.930]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Turt Burglar.
[00:52.930 --> 00:55.090]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Frugal Rock.
[00:55.090 --> 00:57.570]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Indica Chris.
[00:57.570 --> 01:00.170]  Let's send a big fist bump to Brohan78.
[01:00.170 --> 01:01.690]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big
[01:01.690 --> 01:04.250]  Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:04.250 --> 01:05.890]  to Stoner Dave.
[01:05.930 --> 01:08.330]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
[01:08.330 --> 01:11.050]  who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:11.050 --> 01:12.930]  If you are not already supporting the show
[01:12.930 --> 01:14.710]  and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:14.710 --> 01:16.330]  all you have to do is visit
[01:16.330 --> 01:21.090]  www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:21.090 --> 01:22.390]  All of the information you need
[01:22.390 --> 01:23.910]  will be right there on the screen.
[01:23.910 --> 01:26.650]  And you know I do include that link in the show notes
[01:26.650 --> 01:29.530]  and in the video description to make it super easy
[01:29.530 --> 01:33.650]  for all of my friends to support the show on Patreon.
[01:33.650 --> 01:35.930]  Before we get too far let me remind you
[01:35.930 --> 01:38.170]  that we are approaching the 4th of July.
[01:38.170 --> 01:40.130]  Here in my neighborhood we play a game
[01:40.130 --> 01:43.610]  which I like to call gunshots or fireworks.
[01:43.610 --> 01:46.370]  Quite often we hear some bangs, some booms, some pops.
[01:46.370 --> 01:48.130]  And at this time of year you just wonder
[01:48.130 --> 01:49.890]  was that gunshots or fireworks?
[01:49.890 --> 01:51.190]  And you place your bets.
[01:51.190 --> 01:53.710]  Oftentimes you never find out who's the winner or not.
[01:53.710 --> 01:56.330]  My point is if you hear some bangs, some pops, some booms,
[01:56.330 --> 01:58.170]  play along, try to decide with me.
[01:58.170 --> 02:00.050]  Were those gunshots or fireworks?
[02:00.050 --> 02:02.190]  You never know around here.
[02:02.190 --> 02:03.830]  Now is the time when I do want to invite you
[02:03.830 --> 02:06.710]  to the Dude Grows Growers Cup.
[02:06.710 --> 02:09.750]  That's right, the DGC Growers Cup is coming to Fort Collins
[02:09.750 --> 02:12.830]  July 30th from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m.
[02:12.830 --> 02:15.190]  in somewhere right outside of Fort Collins.
[02:15.190 --> 02:17.690]  I do look forward to seeing you, your crew,
[02:17.690 --> 02:20.990]  your smoke buddies at the DGC Growers Cup.

[02:22.490 --> 02:24.310]  join a bunch of other great breeders.
[02:24.310 --> 02:29.190]  Join the Irie Army, the DGC crew at the DGC Growers Cup
[02:29.190 --> 02:31.710]  July 30th just outside of Fort Collins.
[02:32.550 --> 02:34.110]  For all of the info, all of the links, all of the details,
[02:34.110 --> 02:38.390]  all the tickets you may need will be at dudegrows.com.
[02:38.390 --> 02:40.910]  Go check them out, let them know that Rasta Jeff sent you.
[02:40.910 --> 02:42.350]  I do look forward to seeing you
[02:42.350 --> 02:45.770]  at the Dude Grows Growers Cup event.
[02:45.770 --> 02:48.230]  I will be there with a bunch of great beans available.
[02:48.230 --> 02:51.390]  Come say hi, come take a selfie, come give me a fist bump,
[02:51.390 --> 02:52.430]  come chat, come hang out.
[02:52.430 --> 02:53.610]  It will be a long day.
[02:53.610 --> 02:55.930]  I may be busy sometimes, but if there's a break,
[02:55.930 --> 02:57.930]  come shake my hand, come give me a fist bump,
[02:57.930 --> 02:59.550]  come introduce yourself,
[02:59.550 --> 03:01.230]  come share some of your fine flowers.
[03:01.750 --> 03:02.670]  I would love to see what you're doing.
[03:02.670 --> 03:03.630]  All right, let's move on.
[03:03.630 --> 03:06.070]  I do have a lot to talk about in this podcast.
[03:06.070 --> 03:08.270]  I've got an email here in front of me,
[03:08.270 --> 03:09.650]  which I get very often.
[03:09.650 --> 03:11.150]  I don't answer this question enough
[03:11.150 --> 03:13.050]  because this is a big podcast.
[03:13.050 --> 03:15.130]  So I did put this one together for you.
[03:15.130 --> 03:16.530]  The question is very simple.
[03:16.530 --> 03:19.270]  It says, I have a spider mite problem.
[03:19.270 --> 03:20.870]  I could read you a lot more of the email,
[03:20.870 --> 03:22.930]  but I think that gets us right to the point.
[03:22.930 --> 03:25.670]  Let's jump into something that is very important
[03:25.670 --> 03:27.870]  for any cannabis grower of any level.
[03:27.870 --> 03:29.370]  If you're brand new at growing,
[03:29.370 --> 03:30.750]  if you're experienced at growing,
[03:31.230 --> 03:32.550]  if you're somewhere in between there,
[03:32.550 --> 03:34.670]  integrated pest management is something
[03:34.670 --> 03:37.350]  that should be on your radar, on your mind,
[03:37.350 --> 03:39.350]  in your standard operating procedures.
[03:39.350 --> 03:41.150]  That should be part of your method,
[03:41.150 --> 03:43.170]  part of the method to your madness.
[03:43.170 --> 03:45.630]  We are going to get invaded by bugs at some point.
[03:45.630 --> 03:47.830]  You may have not gotten bugs at this point.
[03:47.830 --> 03:49.030]  I'm gonna knock on wood for you
[03:49.030 --> 03:50.350]  and hope that you don't get them,
[03:50.350 --> 03:53.870]  but the chances are someday you're going to get bugs.
[03:53.870 --> 03:55.610]  And I would like you to be prepared,
[03:55.610 --> 03:57.510]  understand how to eradicate them,
[03:57.510 --> 03:59.370]  also understand how to prevent them.
[03:59.370 --> 04:03.670]  So let's get into an integrated pest management podcast.
[04:03.670 --> 04:05.410]  The main question is about spider mites,
[04:05.410 --> 04:09.750]  but with any pest, any bug, almost most problems in life,
[04:09.750 --> 04:12.530]  I like to say, set yourself up for success.
[04:12.530 --> 04:15.470]  When it comes to bugs, spider mites, thrips, fungus gnats,
[04:15.470 --> 04:18.950]  almost any pest we can think of, prevention is key.
[04:18.950 --> 04:20.950]  If we can prevent them from getting in there,
[04:20.950 --> 04:22.810]  have some sort of security system in place,
[04:22.810 --> 04:24.850]  a standard operating procedure,
[04:24.850 --> 04:26.450]  that will make things a lot easier.
[04:26.450 --> 04:27.970]  So if you're not already doing
[04:27.970 --> 04:30.250]  some sort of preventative program
[04:30.250 --> 04:32.010]  to make sure the bugs don't come,
[04:32.010 --> 04:34.690]  now may be a good time to start thinking about it.
[04:34.690 --> 04:37.250]  Think about it this way, when shit goes down,
[04:37.250 --> 04:38.970]  would you rather have security guards there
[04:38.970 --> 04:41.150]  waiting to break up the rumble, the mite battle,
[04:41.150 --> 04:42.890]  the mite orgy, because that's what's gonna happen.
[04:42.890 --> 04:45.730]  It's gonna be a mite picnic and then a mite orgy.
[04:45.730 --> 04:47.530]  Do you want security guards there already?
[04:47.530 --> 04:50.450]  Those security guards could be either a spray application
[04:50.450 --> 04:53.610]  or those security guards could be other beneficial insects,
[04:53.610 --> 04:56.530]  but would you rather have security on standby
[04:56.530 --> 04:58.970]  or would you rather have to call the cops
[04:58.970 --> 05:00.130]  and wait for them to show up,
[05:00.130 --> 05:02.730]  which could be for you to spot the problem
[05:02.730 --> 05:04.250]  and then start applying a pesticide
[05:04.250 --> 05:06.890]  or maybe even to have to order the predator bugs
[05:06.890 --> 05:09.690]  from an insectiary, wait for them to come distribute them,
[05:09.690 --> 05:11.170]  wait for them to develop population
[05:11.170 --> 05:12.850]  and start eradicating your bugs.
[05:12.850 --> 05:15.530]  Prevention is key, I would rather have security on hand.
[05:15.530 --> 05:17.350]  I don't wanna have to wait for those bugs
[05:17.350 --> 05:18.530]  or sprays to arrive.
[05:18.530 --> 05:21.190]  So prevention is key.
[05:21.190 --> 05:22.810]  What are you doing in your room
[05:22.810 --> 05:25.290]  to make sure that no bugs get into your room?
[05:25.290 --> 05:26.450]  There are a lot of things you can do.
[05:26.450 --> 05:28.650]  If you've got cracks in the walls,
[05:28.650 --> 05:30.210]  seal those cracks up with some caulk.
[05:30.210 --> 05:32.790]  If you've got a window or something where things can get in,
[05:32.790 --> 05:35.130]  get some tape over that, get some sort of sealer.
[05:35.130 --> 05:37.290]  Think of all the ins and outs in your grow space
[05:37.290 --> 05:38.890]  and seal all of that stuff up.
[05:38.890 --> 05:41.810]  Keep in mind, it gets cold outside, it gets hot outside.
[05:41.810 --> 05:44.930]  In your grow room, that's the most perfect environment
[05:44.930 --> 05:46.890]  for most of the bugs that we're gonna face.
[05:46.890 --> 05:49.290]  That's why they thrive so well in our grow room.
[05:49.290 --> 05:52.450]  We're providing the perfect temperature, the perfect VPD.
[05:52.450 --> 05:54.890]  We give water at a very specific interval
[05:55.450 --> 05:56.290]  and the bugs love that rhythm.
[05:56.290 --> 05:57.130]  If the plants are happy,
[05:57.130 --> 05:59.210]  the bugs are probably happy as well.
[05:59.210 --> 06:02.290]  So it's outside, the bugs can feel and sense
[06:02.290 --> 06:03.890]  that there's warmth in that other room.
[06:03.890 --> 06:06.030]  They can smell those great turps in that other room
[06:06.030 --> 06:07.890]  and they're like, hey guys, it's cold and shitty.
[06:07.890 --> 06:10.050]  We're out here living in a fucking rosebush.
[06:10.050 --> 06:11.850]  Let's go party in there where the weed plants are
[06:11.850 --> 06:13.770]  and all the spider mites just find one little crack
[06:13.770 --> 06:15.970]  in the wall, one little gap in the window.
[06:15.970 --> 06:17.410]  They congregate into your weed plants
[06:17.410 --> 06:18.330]  where it's fucking beautiful.
[06:18.330 --> 06:20.470]  It's Jamaica and they're all day long.
[06:20.470 --> 06:23.050]  You gotta adjust the right temp, just the right VPD.
[06:23.050 --> 06:25.170]  They go make a little hammock up on one of your plants.
[06:25.170 --> 06:27.410]  They start eating, then they start breeding,
[06:27.410 --> 06:28.390]  then they take over.
[06:28.390 --> 06:29.890]  So they know that it's there.
[06:29.890 --> 06:31.370]  Let's prevent them from coming in.
[06:31.370 --> 06:35.810]  Let's think about ways that these bugs get into our grows.
[06:35.810 --> 06:37.130]  A lot of times, like I just mentioned,
[06:37.130 --> 06:38.970]  they come in through the cracks in the wall.
[06:38.970 --> 06:40.250]  Sometimes they're already there.
[06:40.250 --> 06:41.610]  Many of these bugs are very common.
[06:41.610 --> 06:43.810]  If there are plants around, they're already there.
[06:43.810 --> 06:45.010]  But how do they get into the grow
[06:45.010 --> 06:46.850]  if they're not already in the space?
[06:46.850 --> 06:49.690]  A lot of times they will come in your soil.
[06:49.730 --> 06:54.250]  Many people blame a specific brand of soil or soilless mix
[06:54.250 --> 06:56.810]  for having bugs in it.
[06:56.810 --> 06:58.850]  Every brand can have bugs in it.
[06:58.850 --> 07:00.610]  I don't care if it's Ocean Forest.
[07:00.610 --> 07:01.770]  I don't care if it's Pro-Mix.
[07:01.770 --> 07:03.610]  I don't care if it's Roots Organics.
[07:03.610 --> 07:06.010]  All of those bags of dirt have the potential
[07:06.010 --> 07:07.050]  to have bugs in them.
[07:07.050 --> 07:10.190]  I've gotten bugs in every bag of dirt, every brand.
[07:10.190 --> 07:12.690]  There's been no brand that has been bug-free.
[07:12.690 --> 07:13.650]  Let's talk about this.
[07:13.650 --> 07:16.530]  People claim I bought Ocean Forest and got bugs in it.
[07:16.530 --> 07:18.850]  I bought Roots 707 and got bugs in it.
[07:18.850 --> 07:19.850]  I bought the other brand.
[07:19.850 --> 07:21.490]  Whatever it is, it doesn't matter.
[07:21.490 --> 07:23.050]  Yes, of course, there's bugs in there.
[07:23.050 --> 07:24.010]  It's fucking soil.
[07:24.010 --> 07:24.830]  It's soilless mix.
[07:24.830 --> 07:25.670]  It's dirt.
[07:25.670 --> 07:27.370]  It's very desirable for bugs.
[07:27.370 --> 07:30.710]  Also, it is made, stored, and kept in a place
[07:30.710 --> 07:33.590]  where those bugs are very readily available.
[07:33.590 --> 07:37.490]  You can't blame any specific brand for giving you bugs.
[07:37.490 --> 07:40.330]  All of the bags of soil are kept in a,
[07:40.330 --> 07:42.490]  most of them are made very near each other.
[07:42.490 --> 07:44.310]  Then they're sent to a warehouse.
[07:44.310 --> 07:45.890]  They're all kept in a warehouse together.
[07:45.890 --> 07:47.090]  Do you think the bugs go,
[07:47.170 --> 07:49.610]  hey, let's just go into this one bag.
[07:49.610 --> 07:52.010]  The bugs are not brand loyal is what I'm trying to say.
[07:52.010 --> 07:53.010]  They don't care about,
[07:53.010 --> 07:55.010]  they can't see the cool coloring on the roots
[07:55.010 --> 07:56.530]  or on the Fox Farms bag.
[07:56.530 --> 07:58.590]  They don't know those fish are even printed there.
[07:58.590 --> 08:01.050]  Those bugs go wherever they can go to find a party,
[08:01.050 --> 08:02.850]  to get some warmth, to get some food.
[08:02.850 --> 08:05.290]  They wanna eat and they wanna breed just like you.
[08:05.290 --> 08:07.330]  They're gonna go into every bag that's available.
[08:07.330 --> 08:09.250]  You just bought a bag that had bugs in it
[08:09.250 --> 08:12.410]  and it happened to be whichever brand you chose.
[08:12.410 --> 08:15.050]  If you've gotten a bag of soil that had bugs in it,
[08:15.090 --> 08:17.970]  it wasn't the maker of that soils fault.
[08:17.970 --> 08:19.850]  That soil went to a warehouse.
[08:19.850 --> 08:22.510]  It stayed in a warehouse, possibly outdoors.
[08:22.510 --> 08:24.130]  There's a very popular
[08:24.130 --> 08:26.050]  grow supply center in Colorado Springs.
[08:26.050 --> 08:28.630]  They keep all of their soil outdoors.
[08:28.630 --> 08:32.650]  If there are bugs in one bag, they're going in every bag.
[08:32.650 --> 08:34.490]  They're gonna overload that one bag,
[08:34.490 --> 08:35.970]  all the food, all the hiding places,
[08:35.970 --> 08:37.030]  the hotel will be booked.
[08:37.030 --> 08:38.490]  They're gonna go somewhere else,
[08:38.490 --> 08:39.950]  which is the next bag over.
[08:39.950 --> 08:40.990]  It may be a different brand.
[08:40.990 --> 08:42.410]  It may be the same brand.
[08:42.410 --> 08:44.170]  All the brands are gonna get bugs.
[08:44.170 --> 08:46.930]  They get transferred in the same trucks.
[08:46.930 --> 08:50.570]  The Roots Organics, the Fox Farms, the Tupper,
[08:50.570 --> 08:53.090]  the fucking everything, it came on the same truck.
[08:53.090 --> 08:55.370]  Why wouldn't the bugs travel from bag to bag?
[08:55.370 --> 08:58.370]  So don't blame any specific brand
[08:58.370 --> 09:00.330]  for getting bugs into your grow.
[09:00.330 --> 09:03.130]  That is your responsibility as the farmer,
[09:03.130 --> 09:05.450]  as the lead grower, as the head cultivator,
[09:05.450 --> 09:07.250]  as the head motherfucker in charge.
[09:07.250 --> 09:09.390]  It is your responsibility to make sure
[09:09.390 --> 09:11.590]  that bugs don't make it into your grow.
[09:11.590 --> 09:14.010]  Inspect the soil, treat it with the pesticide,
[09:14.850 --> 09:17.450]  treat it with the predator bug
[09:17.450 --> 09:18.950]  if that's what you've got to do,
[09:18.950 --> 09:20.890]  but be preventative, inspect your soil.
[09:20.890 --> 09:23.490]  It is your job to make sure that doesn't get in there.
[09:23.490 --> 09:25.410]  Treat everything like there is bugs.
[09:25.410 --> 09:27.490]  There are bugs on everything that comes in.
[09:27.490 --> 09:28.970]  There's bugs in the soil.
[09:28.970 --> 09:30.530]  Let's talk about the next way they come in.
[09:30.530 --> 09:31.730]  They come in on plants.
[09:31.730 --> 09:33.410]  Are you bringing in clones?
[09:33.410 --> 09:35.290]  Are you getting cuttings from a friend?
[09:35.290 --> 09:37.870]  That is a great way to bring in bugs.
[09:37.870 --> 09:39.090]  All of your friends are gonna say,
[09:39.090 --> 09:42.250]  dude, my grow is clean, I don't have anything.
[09:42.250 --> 09:44.470]  The person that claims to have the cleanest grow
[09:44.470 --> 09:46.610]  is usually the person with the worst bugs.
[09:46.610 --> 09:48.330]  They just haven't found them yet.
[09:48.330 --> 09:49.870]  So when you get a clone or a plant
[09:49.870 --> 09:52.450]  or a cutting from a friend, make sure it is treated.
[09:52.450 --> 09:54.890]  That's the best way to bring unwanted bugs
[09:54.890 --> 09:56.690]  into your grow room.
[09:56.690 --> 09:57.730]  All right, here's a side note
[09:57.730 --> 10:00.010]  that I'm going to totally derail my train of thought
[10:00.010 --> 10:00.970]  and try to throw this in.
[10:00.970 --> 10:02.730]  It's not on my notes, but I just thought about this.
[10:02.730 --> 10:05.550]  We build very nice grow rooms indoors.
[10:05.550 --> 10:07.090]  We put really good lights in there.
[10:07.090 --> 10:08.850]  We put ducting in there.
[10:08.850 --> 10:09.810]  We clean everything up.
[10:09.810 --> 10:11.490]  Hopefully, hopefully you're cleaning your grow space.
[10:11.490 --> 10:12.730]  Clean that shit up, dude.
[10:12.730 --> 10:14.290]  I'm talking to myself too.
[10:14.290 --> 10:16.730]  We build these really nice controlled environments.
[10:16.730 --> 10:18.410]  I do not find it wise.
[10:18.410 --> 10:21.570]  I would not recommend to move our ganja plants
[10:21.570 --> 10:24.390]  that we have in our indoor area outdoors
[10:24.390 --> 10:27.330]  for sunshine during the day and then back inside.
[10:27.330 --> 10:29.170]  I would not recommend that.
[10:29.170 --> 10:30.610]  If that is something you choose to do,
[10:30.610 --> 10:32.610]  if that's your main strategy, that's cool.
[10:32.610 --> 10:34.770]  But if that is your main grow space
[10:34.770 --> 10:38.050]  where you mainly intend to have the plants indoors,
[10:38.050 --> 10:40.610]  I wouldn't contaminate it with the outdoor plants.
[10:40.610 --> 10:42.770]  The minute you put those plants outdoors,
[10:42.770 --> 10:44.650]  they're going to get trespassers.
[10:44.650 --> 10:46.210]  They're going to get stowaways.
[10:46.210 --> 10:48.170]  You're going to bring them into your grow space.
[10:48.170 --> 10:50.110]  They're going to find places to hide in there.
[10:50.110 --> 10:52.090]  It's Jamaica, like we talked about earlier.
[10:52.090 --> 10:53.930]  It's perfect environment in there.
[10:53.930 --> 10:55.890]  Some of the bugs might hop off that plant
[10:55.890 --> 10:57.330]  and stay in the room the next time
[10:57.330 --> 10:59.070]  you carry that plant outside.
[10:59.070 --> 11:01.290]  So now you've kind of contaminated that indoor grow
[11:01.290 --> 11:02.330]  with outdoor bugs.
[11:02.330 --> 11:03.850]  You just brought the bugs in.
[11:03.850 --> 11:05.490]  The reason we really built that room
[11:05.490 --> 11:08.070]  was to isolate everything and keep that plant safe
[11:08.070 --> 11:09.710]  from all of those outdoor bugs.
[11:09.710 --> 11:11.350]  We've got a perfect room in there.
[11:11.350 --> 11:13.750]  So I don't recommend moving your plants
[11:13.750 --> 11:15.550]  from indoors to outdoors.
[11:15.550 --> 11:16.750]  That is not, and then back in.
[11:16.750 --> 11:18.330]  That's not something I would recommend.
[11:18.330 --> 11:20.590]  Have indoor plants or have outdoor plants.
[11:20.590 --> 11:22.470]  I understand you're going to do light depth
[11:22.470 --> 11:23.870]  and some shit like that is going to happen.
[11:23.870 --> 11:25.950]  But my general recommendation
[11:25.950 --> 11:28.310]  is if you've built a nice indoor grow room,
[11:28.310 --> 11:31.590]  have a nice indoor grow room that you've never contaminated
[11:31.590 --> 11:33.470]  with those outdoor plants.
[11:33.470 --> 11:34.630]  What I was getting to before
[11:34.630 --> 11:36.470]  that I want to get back on track is
[11:36.470 --> 11:39.110]  when you get new plants, new clones from a friend,
[11:39.110 --> 11:40.870]  make sure you isolate those plants.
[11:40.870 --> 11:43.650]  Don't take those right into general population.
[11:43.650 --> 11:45.870]  You can put, if you get a clone, a small plant,
[11:45.870 --> 11:48.350]  you can put it in the windowsill for a couple of days,
[11:48.350 --> 11:49.270]  take it out of the window,
[11:49.270 --> 11:52.110]  treat it with whatever pesticide you choose to use.
[11:52.110 --> 11:54.010]  Something, I use something strong.
[11:54.010 --> 11:56.390]  When shit comes in, if I get a cut from anybody,
[11:56.390 --> 11:58.270]  if it was from one of my best friends,
[11:58.270 --> 11:59.510]  if it was from my mama,
[11:59.510 --> 12:01.850]  if it was from my girlfriend or a complete stranger,
[12:01.850 --> 12:04.230]  I'm going to treat that clone the same.
[12:04.230 --> 12:05.270]  It's contaminated.
[12:05.270 --> 12:07.270]  In my mind, it is contaminated.
[12:07.270 --> 12:11.390]  It's got mites, thrips, fungus gnats, powdery mildew.
[12:11.390 --> 12:12.490]  It's got herpes.
[12:12.490 --> 12:14.350]  It's got all the shit you could imagine.
[12:14.350 --> 12:16.550]  I'm going to treat it and keep it away from my plants
[12:16.550 --> 12:20.290]  for seven to 10 days until I'm sure that that plant is clear
[12:20.290 --> 12:22.150]  then it gets to go into general population.
[12:22.150 --> 12:25.350]  I cannot risk bringing shit in and destroying a grow.
[12:25.350 --> 12:27.950]  I got spider mites from a very reputable grower
[12:27.950 --> 12:30.830]  and they were the most ferocious fucking spider mites
[12:30.830 --> 12:31.670]  I've ever seen.
[12:31.670 --> 12:32.990]  They did some damage, slowed me down.
[12:32.990 --> 12:34.070]  We recovered.
[12:34.070 --> 12:35.730]  However, they did fuck me up.
[12:35.730 --> 12:37.110]  I learned my lesson there.
[12:37.950 --> 12:39.310]  I talk about mistakes I've made,
[12:39.310 --> 12:42.910]  trusting a very reputable, popular grower,
[12:42.910 --> 12:43.750]  fucked me over.
[12:43.750 --> 12:45.750]  I got a clone that was riddled with mites.
[12:45.750 --> 12:47.870]  I brought it right in and before I noticed we were fucked.
[12:47.870 --> 12:49.830]  All right, we're talking about how bugs come in.
[12:49.830 --> 12:52.310]  Bugs come in on the soil.
[12:52.310 --> 12:53.630]  They make it in the soil.
[12:53.630 --> 12:55.510]  Bugs come in in other plants.
[12:55.510 --> 13:00.510]  Bugs also come in on you, your clothing, your shoes,
[13:00.550 --> 13:01.590]  your dreadlocks.
[13:01.590 --> 13:03.110]  Yes, I'm holding up my own dreadlocks.
[13:03.110 --> 13:03.950]  I'm guilty.
[13:03.950 --> 13:04.970]  I'm talking about it myself.
[13:04.970 --> 13:06.850]  My dreads go to my calves, you guys.
[13:07.590 --> 13:08.430]  I don't know if you've seen recent pictures
[13:08.430 --> 13:09.650]  I posted on the gram.
[13:09.650 --> 13:11.650]  My dreadlocks, I'm six foot five.
[13:11.650 --> 13:14.610]  I'm six foot five tall and my dreadlocks touch my calves.
[13:14.610 --> 13:15.890]  I got quite a bit of hair.
[13:15.890 --> 13:17.830]  I do have a dedicated grow area hat.
[13:17.830 --> 13:19.250]  I keep the dreads tied up.
[13:19.250 --> 13:21.910]  I try to keep the, I just try to mitigate problems there.
[13:21.910 --> 13:24.790]  But you do bring, you travel the bugs around
[13:24.790 --> 13:26.970]  through your shoes, your pants, your shirt,
[13:26.970 --> 13:28.990]  your dreadlocks, your long hair,
[13:28.990 --> 13:30.090]  whatever you may be wearing.
[13:30.090 --> 13:32.270]  That's a great way to move bugs around.
[13:32.270 --> 13:34.010]  Also, we've talked about it before,
[13:34.010 --> 13:36.530]  the dog will bring bugs into your grow room.
[13:36.530 --> 13:38.330]  I don't prefer to have the dog in there.
[13:38.330 --> 13:41.650]  That's man's best friend, but be my best friend upstairs.
[13:41.650 --> 13:44.750]  We'll hang out in the backyard, stay out of my grow space.
[13:44.750 --> 13:47.770]  So the bugs make it in in a variety of ways.
[13:47.770 --> 13:51.490]  It is our responsibility to minimize those ways
[13:51.490 --> 13:52.650]  for those bugs to get in.
[13:52.650 --> 13:55.810]  It's your responsibility, like I said, we're farmers.
[13:55.810 --> 13:57.970]  We're growing an agricultural product.
[13:57.970 --> 14:00.570]  We've got to keep a farmer's mindset in mind.
[14:00.570 --> 14:02.510]  And that means we're battling pests and insects
[14:02.510 --> 14:04.370]  at all times.
[14:04.370 --> 14:06.970]  Unfortunately, some of the pests that we are battling
[14:06.970 --> 14:09.730]  are nearly or are actually microscopic.
[14:09.730 --> 14:10.850]  So we can't even see them.
[14:10.850 --> 14:12.970]  So we've got to pay attention to the plants.
[14:12.970 --> 14:14.610]  We've got to keep a good eye on the garden
[14:14.610 --> 14:16.610]  and see what that garden is telling us
[14:16.610 --> 14:19.890]  and be ready to react as soon as we see a problem
[14:19.890 --> 14:20.890]  based on an insect.
[14:20.890 --> 14:23.690]  Now, the reaction part is where people really mess up.
[14:23.690 --> 14:26.870]  They see a small problem and they want to do something
[14:26.870 --> 14:29.130]  freaking crazy to solve that problem.
[14:29.130 --> 14:31.330]  And they overkill the small problem
[14:31.330 --> 14:34.410]  and cause a bigger, bigger problem by panic mode.
[14:34.410 --> 14:36.770]  I talk about panic mode, grower panic mode.
[14:36.770 --> 14:38.590]  You see that little issue and you've got,
[14:38.590 --> 14:40.890]  your plants are at risk and now you just fuck everything up
[14:40.890 --> 14:41.970]  because you went into panic mode
[14:41.970 --> 14:43.750]  and didn't think things through.
[14:43.750 --> 14:46.290]  Think about what you're gonna do when you get those pests.
[14:46.290 --> 14:48.890]  Start thinking now, how nuclear do I wanna go?
[14:48.890 --> 14:50.170]  How gentle do I wanna go?
[14:50.170 --> 14:53.490]  How abrasive or toxic do I wanna be with the pesticides
[14:53.490 --> 14:54.530]  which I choose to use?
[14:54.530 --> 14:55.750]  That is up to you.
[14:55.750 --> 14:57.090]  I will make recommendations.
[14:57.090 --> 14:58.570]  I'll give you product names.
[14:58.570 --> 15:03.570]  But I do not judge you based on the pesticides
[15:04.050 --> 15:05.930]  you choose to use in your garden.
[15:05.930 --> 15:09.410]  I do judge you if you use a product too late
[15:09.410 --> 15:12.570]  in the flowering stage or in flowering stage
[15:12.570 --> 15:15.570]  and there are residual chemicals left behind
[15:15.570 --> 15:17.610]  that can cause harm to a consumer.
[15:17.610 --> 15:19.410]  I will judge you for that.
[15:19.410 --> 15:23.410]  If you use a pesticide correctly and properly
[15:23.410 --> 15:27.610]  at the right interval, duration, dilution, application rate,
[15:27.610 --> 15:28.730]  you're safe about it.
[15:28.730 --> 15:31.490]  I will not judge you for any product you choose to use
[15:31.490 --> 15:33.450]  if you're doing it safely and correctly.
[15:33.450 --> 15:35.290]  That's what the products are for.
[15:35.290 --> 15:36.890]  That's what we're, we've got a goal.
[15:36.890 --> 15:38.650]  We've got a product to protect.
[15:38.650 --> 15:42.570]  I understand, but it is your prerogative,
[15:42.570 --> 15:46.930]  how toxic, how gentle, what products you want to use.
[15:46.930 --> 15:48.770]  Some things are pretty fucking rough.
[15:48.770 --> 15:50.970]  Some things are really fluffy and gentle.
[15:50.970 --> 15:53.130]  People wanna stick to the word organic.
[15:53.130 --> 15:55.410]  I always say, remember that cyanide is organic
[15:55.450 --> 15:57.690]  and just a couple of drops of that will kill you.
[15:57.690 --> 16:00.450]  So don't let the word organic be too much of a buzzword
[16:00.450 --> 16:02.090]  when it comes to pest eradication.
[16:02.090 --> 16:04.770]  Just because a product is organic,
[16:04.770 --> 16:09.330]  doesn't mean that it is safer, less harmful to a human body,
[16:09.330 --> 16:10.770]  less harmful to the environment
[16:10.770 --> 16:13.850]  than a product that doesn't have an organic stamp on it.
[16:13.850 --> 16:16.650]  Also with that same thing being said,
[16:16.650 --> 16:20.070]  an organic product does not have to be considered
[16:20.070 --> 16:22.770]  less effective than a non-organic product.
[16:22.770 --> 16:24.330]  For the right situation,
[16:24.330 --> 16:27.450]  that organic product may wipe out your fucking problem.
[16:27.450 --> 16:29.750]  On the same, in the same battlefield,
[16:29.750 --> 16:31.330]  in a different situation,
[16:31.330 --> 16:34.730]  that non-organic product may be exactly what you need.
[16:34.730 --> 16:35.990]  It's all about situation.
[16:35.990 --> 16:37.170]  It's all about understanding.
[16:37.170 --> 16:39.310]  It's all about the pest you're trying to attack.
[16:39.310 --> 16:41.170]  A lot of it is based on the phase of growth
[16:41.170 --> 16:42.790]  which these plants are in.
[16:42.790 --> 16:44.570]  I wanna get back to where I was.
[16:44.570 --> 16:48.370]  It is up to you to decide the level of abrasiveness,
[16:48.370 --> 16:51.490]  toxicity, how powerful, how potent
[16:51.490 --> 16:53.090]  you wanna go with your pesticides.
[16:53.090 --> 16:54.890]  Do your research on the products
[16:54.890 --> 16:57.070]  you are thinking about using.
[16:57.070 --> 16:59.610]  Read the MSDS sheets, see what's in there.
[16:59.610 --> 17:01.270]  Read the active ingredient.
[17:01.270 --> 17:03.090]  Read, is it toxic?
[17:03.090 --> 17:03.930]  Is it poisonous?
[17:03.930 --> 17:05.550]  What does it do to the environment?
[17:05.550 --> 17:06.650]  Read about that product.
[17:06.650 --> 17:08.430]  Do you wanna spray that on flowers
[17:08.430 --> 17:10.370]  that you're going to consume?
[17:10.370 --> 17:11.930]  If you're the only one consuming it,
[17:11.930 --> 17:14.330]  spray whatever the fuck you feel you're safe with doing.
[17:14.330 --> 17:16.130]  If you're going to give it to other people,
[17:16.130 --> 17:18.450]  keep them in mind, spray something that is safer.
[17:18.450 --> 17:20.650]  Maybe stick with something with a shorter half-life,
[17:20.650 --> 17:22.850]  something, let's talk about half-life.
[17:23.610 --> 17:24.450]  Somebody asked me about this
[17:24.450 --> 17:26.930]  on an Instagram live feed lately, recently.
[17:26.930 --> 17:30.050]  Half-life, when I spray a product over a certain duration,
[17:30.050 --> 17:32.170]  it is going to break down 50%
[17:32.170 --> 17:33.750]  and that product will not be available
[17:33.750 --> 17:35.810]  on the plants anymore.
[17:35.810 --> 17:37.010]  I don't know the exact science.
[17:37.010 --> 17:40.410]  It biodegrades, it breaks down, it disappears.
[17:40.410 --> 17:43.170]  The sun breaks it down, the wind breaks it down,
[17:43.170 --> 17:44.650]  the rain breaks it down.
[17:44.650 --> 17:48.770]  The availability of that product on the plants
[17:48.770 --> 17:50.130]  dilutes, dissipates.
[17:50.130 --> 17:53.050]  Again, I'm not completely qualified to teach this,
[17:53.050 --> 17:54.690]  but I'll teach you the way that I know it.
[17:54.690 --> 17:57.410]  When you spray that product on there, it's 100%.
[17:57.410 --> 18:00.910]  Over a certain amount of time, it breaks down to 50%.
[18:00.910 --> 18:04.450]  Then over at that time again, it breaks down to 25%.
[18:04.450 --> 18:06.850]  Then over time, you get 12.5%.
[18:06.850 --> 18:09.410]  Then over time again, you get 6.25%.
[18:09.410 --> 18:11.810]  Then eventually you're down to 3.12%.
[18:11.810 --> 18:13.450]  Keeps breaking half-life.
[18:13.450 --> 18:16.710]  Understand the half-life of the product you are using.
[18:16.710 --> 18:19.470]  Also, understand the re-entry interval
[18:19.470 --> 18:20.790]  of the product you are using.
[18:20.790 --> 18:23.530]  That is, when you apply a product in a grow space,
[18:23.530 --> 18:24.990]  how long do you have to wait
[18:24.990 --> 18:27.630]  to safely enter that grow space again?
[18:27.630 --> 18:30.030]  Now I wanna group these two things together.
[18:30.030 --> 18:32.910]  Take your half-life and your re-entry interval,
[18:32.910 --> 18:36.050]  and if you're growing indoors, increase those drastically,
[18:36.050 --> 18:39.530]  because in an outdoor environment, we've got the sun.
[18:39.530 --> 18:41.470]  The sun will break down those chemicals,
[18:41.470 --> 18:42.890]  those products, those agents,
[18:42.890 --> 18:45.190]  the ingredients in the pesticide spray,
[18:45.190 --> 18:47.550]  and they won't last as long on the plant.
[18:47.550 --> 18:48.410]  They will disappear.
[18:48.410 --> 18:51.250]  They'll be gone basically in a shorter amount of time,
[18:51.250 --> 18:54.770]  because like I said earlier, the wind, the sun, the rain,
[18:54.770 --> 18:56.430]  those things get rid of those products.
[18:56.430 --> 18:59.030]  Indoors, we've got caustic grow lights
[18:59.030 --> 19:01.230]  that are nowhere near as powerful as the sun.
[19:01.230 --> 19:03.630]  They're not breaking the chemicals down as quickly,
[19:03.630 --> 19:05.350]  so they will be there longer.
[19:05.350 --> 19:07.730]  We don't have the same ventilation indoors.
[19:07.730 --> 19:10.810]  So your half-life and your re-entry interval
[19:10.810 --> 19:13.510]  basically need to be doubled indoors.
[19:13.510 --> 19:14.910]  Some people aren't gonna follow that.
[19:15.630 --> 19:16.910]  Some people think I'm crazy.
[19:16.910 --> 19:18.010]  As somebody who is trained
[19:18.010 --> 19:20.290]  by the Colorado Department of Agriculture,
[19:20.290 --> 19:22.710]  it's my responsibility to make sure I say it.
[19:22.710 --> 19:24.610]  What you do with that info is up to you.
[19:24.610 --> 19:26.110]  You're a grown-ass fucking adult.
[19:26.110 --> 19:27.770]  Have fun, do your thing, pimpin'.
[19:27.770 --> 19:29.030]  All right, the next thing I wanna talk about,
[19:29.030 --> 19:30.470]  I'm going out of order on my notes here,
[19:30.470 --> 19:33.150]  but I feel like this is very important.
[19:33.150 --> 19:36.430]  Protective personal equipment, PPE,
[19:36.430 --> 19:37.710]  personal protective equipment.
[19:37.710 --> 19:39.790]  I don't know what order I said it in the first time,
[19:39.790 --> 19:42.010]  but protect yourself
[19:42.010 --> 19:44.870]  with the proper personal protective equipment.
[19:45.710 --> 19:46.670]  You guys, when you buy a pesticide,
[19:46.670 --> 19:49.050]  there's a little booklet on the side of the bottle.
[19:49.050 --> 19:51.670]  That's not a story about the guy that made the pesticide.
[19:51.670 --> 19:53.110]  That's not a comic book.
[19:53.110 --> 19:55.250]  That is actually the instructions
[19:55.250 --> 19:57.190]  and a bunch of tips about that product.
[19:57.190 --> 19:59.370]  It will tell you if that product is,
[19:59.370 --> 20:01.430]  if you can drink it, it'll tell you if it's dangerous.
[20:01.430 --> 20:02.590]  It'll tell you if it's toxic.
[20:02.590 --> 20:04.430]  It'll tell you if it'll fucking kill you.
[20:04.430 --> 20:07.030]  It will tell you the personal protective equipment
[20:07.030 --> 20:08.790]  that is recommended for that product.
[20:08.790 --> 20:09.910]  Most of the time,
[20:09.910 --> 20:12.550]  they're going to want you to wear six millimeter or thick.
[20:12.550 --> 20:14.210]  Is it millimeter or milliliter?
[20:14.810 --> 20:17.010]  These are solids, milliliters, or liquids.
[20:17.010 --> 20:20.910]  You want six millimeter or thicker nitrile gloves.
[20:20.910 --> 20:23.610]  Most pesticides are going to ask you to wear long sleeves.
[20:23.610 --> 20:26.770]  We don't want you to get any pesticide on your skin.
[20:26.770 --> 20:29.770]  Most of the time, pants, cover your feet with shoes.
[20:29.770 --> 20:31.490]  A lot of the time, they're going to want to mask
[20:31.490 --> 20:33.090]  some sort of a respirator.
[20:33.090 --> 20:36.090]  Every time, we want some sort of eye protection.
[20:36.090 --> 20:39.630]  What you do from there will be probably pesticide specific,
[20:39.630 --> 20:43.130]  but I recommend putting on the personal protective equipment
[20:43.130 --> 20:45.450]  before you get the pesticides.
[20:45.450 --> 20:47.250]  What if, and I don't know where you work,
[20:47.250 --> 20:48.290]  I don't know where you grow,
[20:48.290 --> 20:51.210]  but what if the person that managed that pesticide
[20:51.210 --> 20:53.690]  before you didn't put the lid on it all the way,
[20:53.690 --> 20:56.330]  and you just naturally grab it,
[20:56.330 --> 20:59.270]  the next move to do with the pesticide is to give it a shake,
[20:59.270 --> 21:00.790]  then measure some out.
[21:00.790 --> 21:02.490]  What if you're just moving, doing your thing,
[21:02.490 --> 21:03.930]  you got Joe Rogan in your ear,
[21:03.930 --> 21:06.170]  maybe I'm in your ear jamming the podcast.
[21:06.170 --> 21:08.250]  You grab that bottle, you give it a shake.
[21:08.250 --> 21:10.790]  If you or the person before you didn't put that lid on
[21:10.790 --> 21:14.630]  all the way, pesticide is now flying out of that bottle.
[21:14.630 --> 21:17.750]  If that pesticide gets in your eye, you could be fucked.
[21:17.750 --> 21:19.150]  You could be really fucked.
[21:19.150 --> 21:20.390]  You could have some big problems.
[21:20.390 --> 21:21.630]  It's going to burn, it's going to suck,
[21:21.630 --> 21:23.390]  but you could have long-term damage.
[21:23.390 --> 21:25.510]  Let's have our personal protective equipment on
[21:25.510 --> 21:27.350]  before we even touch the pesticides.
[21:27.350 --> 21:29.910]  It sounds like overkill, which is what I want.
[21:29.910 --> 21:30.750]  I want overkill.
[21:30.750 --> 21:31.790]  I want you to be safe.
[21:31.790 --> 21:32.870]  I don't want you to get sick.
[21:32.870 --> 21:34.490]  I don't need you contaminated.
[21:34.490 --> 21:35.510]  I want you to live through this.
[21:35.510 --> 21:36.550]  We're growing cannabis.
[21:36.550 --> 21:38.830]  Let's not get fucking hurt growing cannabis.
[21:38.830 --> 21:40.350]  You want to smoke some herb and chill out,
[21:40.910 --> 21:41.750]  and not end up in the fucking hospital.
[21:41.750 --> 21:44.990]  So personal protective equipment is very important.
[21:44.990 --> 21:48.230]  Let me get back on track here and keep my notes here.
[21:48.230 --> 21:50.810]  The products you decide are up to you.
[21:50.810 --> 21:53.810]  The applications you decide to use are up to you.
[21:53.810 --> 21:56.910]  Many people will choose to use predator insects.
[21:56.910 --> 21:59.910]  If that's what you choose to do, that is up to you.
[21:59.910 --> 22:01.870]  It's all up to what you want to do in your grow.
[22:01.870 --> 22:03.350]  That's one of the best parts about growing weed.
[22:03.350 --> 22:07.430]  You get to decide what you want to do.
[22:07.430 --> 22:09.870]  One important thing though is monitoring that grow
[22:09.870 --> 22:11.590]  and keeping an eye out for bugs.
[22:11.590 --> 22:14.030]  How are you going to know if bugs there, are there?
[22:14.030 --> 22:15.390]  Are you scouting personally?
[22:15.390 --> 22:16.870]  Do you have a crew scouting?
[22:16.870 --> 22:20.270]  Occasionally, do you walk in and just blindly grab at a leaf?
[22:20.270 --> 22:22.890]  Occasionally, I don't even know what plant I just touched.
[22:22.890 --> 22:25.030]  I know I just go right there and I took a leaf
[22:25.030 --> 22:27.810]  and I'm going to inspect this leaf very carefully.
[22:27.810 --> 22:28.870]  I'm going to look at the top of it.
[22:28.870 --> 22:30.510]  I can tell a lot by the top.
[22:30.510 --> 22:31.470]  No powdery mildew.
[22:31.470 --> 22:34.070]  It doesn't look like any chew marks, no thrip shit.
[22:34.070 --> 22:34.910]  Looks good.
[22:34.910 --> 22:35.730]  Flip it over.
[22:35.730 --> 22:36.570]  Do I see any spider mites?
[22:36.570 --> 22:37.610]  Do I see any fungus gnats?
[22:37.610 --> 22:39.290]  Do I see any white flies?
[22:39.290 --> 22:41.250]  If that leaf is cool, probably pretty good.
[22:41.250 --> 22:42.090]  I won't pull another one.
[22:42.090 --> 22:42.910]  I don't need to.
[22:42.910 --> 22:44.130]  I've seen all the info I need,
[22:44.130 --> 22:46.210]  but I will go in there sometimes twice a day
[22:46.210 --> 22:48.290]  in my personal grow and just give it a good scouting.
[22:48.290 --> 22:49.130]  How does shit look?
[22:49.130 --> 22:50.850]  Are there any bugs?
[22:50.850 --> 22:54.290]  One thing I want to talk about is yellow sticky traps
[22:54.290 --> 22:55.530]  and the blue sticky traps.
[22:55.530 --> 22:56.930]  Those little cards you guys like to use.
[22:56.930 --> 22:57.750]  I love them.
[22:57.750 --> 22:58.590]  I highly recommend them.
[22:58.590 --> 23:00.170]  Those are great products.
[23:00.170 --> 23:05.170]  However, those are not any way to eradicate or remove a bug.
[23:05.290 --> 23:07.450]  What those are there for is to show you
[23:07.450 --> 23:09.730]  that there is a presence of a pest.
[23:09.730 --> 23:11.970]  They do not do anything to get rid of a bug.
[23:11.970 --> 23:14.370]  A bug has to land on that fucking yellow card
[23:14.370 --> 23:15.790]  for it to do anything.
[23:15.790 --> 23:17.010]  How many of the bugs do you think,
[23:17.010 --> 23:18.770]  oh look, a yellow card, let's jump right onto it.
[23:18.770 --> 23:20.390]  Most of them don't do that.
[23:20.390 --> 23:22.610]  Those are there to show you some of the bugs
[23:22.610 --> 23:23.850]  that are in here were stupid enough
[23:23.850 --> 23:25.050]  to fly onto the yellow card.
[23:25.050 --> 23:27.890]  There are probably a lot more and you should think about it.
[23:27.890 --> 23:29.370]  A lot of them come with like a grid.
[23:29.370 --> 23:31.210]  They've got squares printed on there.
[23:31.210 --> 23:32.730]  That's so that during the morning,
[23:32.730 --> 23:35.370]  you can count, basically get a good visual count.
[23:35.370 --> 23:37.050]  How many bugs per square?
[23:37.570 --> 23:38.530]  There are two bugs per square.
[23:38.530 --> 23:40.250]  There are five bugs per square.
[23:40.250 --> 23:41.370]  There are 20 per square.
[23:41.370 --> 23:42.970]  We're really stepping our shit up.
[23:42.970 --> 23:44.050]  Check again at lunch.
[23:44.050 --> 23:45.250]  See how many there are.
[23:45.250 --> 23:47.090]  See over the day how many bugs progress.
[23:47.090 --> 23:48.650]  Do you need to do something about it
[23:48.650 --> 23:50.690]  or is it an acceptable amount of bugs?
[23:50.690 --> 23:51.890]  What's cool with you?
[23:51.890 --> 23:54.610]  A few fungus gnats and a big grow, that's fine.
[23:54.610 --> 23:56.450]  A bunch of fungus gnats and a small grow,
[23:56.450 --> 23:57.690]  fuck that, we gotta do something.
[23:57.690 --> 23:58.690]  It's up to you.
[23:58.690 --> 24:00.030]  But those yellow sticky traps
[24:00.030 --> 24:02.450]  are not any source of eradication.
[24:02.450 --> 24:04.890]  They are alerting, they're notification.
[24:04.890 --> 24:06.890]  It's not doing anything but telling you
[24:07.730 --> 24:08.930]  that there are bugs here.
[24:08.930 --> 24:11.710]  Now let's talk a little bit about things we can do
[24:11.710 --> 24:14.970]  to get rid of and prevent pests in our grow.
[24:14.970 --> 24:17.330]  Of course, some of the first things we can do
[24:17.330 --> 24:19.710]  come with standard operating procedures.
[24:19.710 --> 24:22.090]  I guess the first thing is building a proper room.
[24:22.090 --> 24:23.050]  Seal that room up.
[24:23.050 --> 24:25.110]  Are all the gaps from outside sealed?
[24:25.110 --> 24:27.050]  Are all the gaps from the other room sealed?
[24:27.050 --> 24:28.490]  Are you clean when you're going in?
[24:28.490 --> 24:30.210]  Do you have a standard operating procedure?
[24:30.210 --> 24:31.970]  Do you have grow room clothes?
[24:31.970 --> 24:33.090]  Do you have grow room shoes?
[24:33.090 --> 24:36.370]  Do you have a grow room hat for your dreadlocks?
[24:36.370 --> 24:37.930]  Are you stepping on one of those mats
[24:37.930 --> 24:39.910]  that's got the cleaner in it to clean up your shoes?
[24:39.910 --> 24:41.330]  Do you put on booties?
[24:41.330 --> 24:43.330]  Do you wear a scrub jacket to go in there
[24:43.330 --> 24:46.250]  or a lab coat or scrubs to go in there?
[24:46.250 --> 24:48.330]  What are you doing to prevent the bugs?
[24:48.330 --> 24:49.770]  The next thing we can do is,
[24:49.770 --> 24:52.090]  I think defoliation is a great way
[24:52.090 --> 24:54.890]  to minimize all of the problems in the grow.
[24:54.890 --> 24:58.510]  If we defoliate, I basically describe the leaves
[24:58.510 --> 25:00.770]  as like hotels and hammocks for the plants.
[25:00.770 --> 25:01.730]  It's where the plants are chilling.
[25:01.730 --> 25:03.210]  That's houses and hotels.
[25:03.210 --> 25:04.050]  They're on the leaves.
[25:04.050 --> 25:05.650]  They're not chilling out on the stalks mostly.
[25:05.650 --> 25:08.170]  Maybe if you got a lot, but they're on the leaves.
[25:08.170 --> 25:09.890]  If there aren't too many leaves,
[25:09.890 --> 25:11.810]  there aren't too many places for bugs.
[25:11.810 --> 25:14.530]  Also, that's a less opportunity for powdery mildew.
[25:14.530 --> 25:15.490]  Get that shit out of there.
[25:15.490 --> 25:16.830]  You don't need all those leaves.
[25:16.830 --> 25:18.210]  That's going to lead to problems.
[25:18.210 --> 25:20.530]  People say that the leaves are the source of food
[25:20.530 --> 25:22.210]  and the solar panels for the plants.
[25:22.210 --> 25:23.450]  Dude, there are so many leaves in there.
[25:23.450 --> 25:24.370]  You could take some out.
[25:24.370 --> 25:25.210]  Don't worry.
[25:25.210 --> 25:26.370]  You don't have to worry about the food.
[25:26.370 --> 25:28.210]  We're feeding the fucking plants through the roots.
[25:28.210 --> 25:29.990]  We're giving them very expensive nutrients.
[25:29.990 --> 25:31.810]  They're eating and they're getting the best light
[25:31.810 --> 25:32.690]  that they can.
[25:32.690 --> 25:33.890]  Take off some of those leaves
[25:33.890 --> 25:35.130]  so that the light can get to the buds
[25:35.610 --> 25:36.690]  that you want to get big and fat.
[25:36.690 --> 25:40.090]  Defoliate, that will help you prevent bug problems.
[25:40.090 --> 25:42.290]  Also, turn up the fan.
[25:42.290 --> 25:43.610]  I think if you turn up some fans
[25:43.610 --> 25:45.090]  and have some airflow in there,
[25:45.090 --> 25:46.850]  the bugs don't want to be around as much.
[25:46.850 --> 25:48.770]  Also, one thing I will notice though,
[25:48.770 --> 25:50.330]  if the bugs do, if the spider mites
[25:50.330 --> 25:51.370]  start getting out of control,
[25:51.370 --> 25:54.350]  they use those fans as like,
[25:54.350 --> 25:55.450]  it's kind of like a hang glider.
[25:55.450 --> 25:57.090]  They climb up to the top of the plant
[25:57.090 --> 25:58.490]  and they catch the wind off the fan
[25:58.490 --> 26:01.170]  and they drop a web and they blow from this plant
[26:01.170 --> 26:02.190]  right over to the next one.
[26:02.190 --> 26:04.090]  They use the fan to do it.
[26:04.090 --> 26:06.930]  So, have the fan in there so that they can't colonize.
[26:06.930 --> 26:08.810]  They can't establish a presence.
[26:08.810 --> 26:10.130]  But once they do get present,
[26:10.130 --> 26:11.490]  you might want to slow down that fan
[26:11.490 --> 26:15.730]  to keep them from traveling around so much.
[26:15.730 --> 26:17.570]  Now, another thing we can do to prevent some bugs
[26:17.570 --> 26:20.330]  is to just make an undesirable environment
[26:20.330 --> 26:22.230]  for any bug that may show up,
[26:22.230 --> 26:24.050]  any pest that may come around.
[26:24.050 --> 26:25.290]  Let me give a quick disclaimer.
[26:25.290 --> 26:27.210]  99% of what I'm going to tell you
[26:27.210 --> 26:28.530]  is going to be for an indoor grow.
[26:28.530 --> 26:30.210]  Outdoor growing is a whole new beast.
[26:30.210 --> 26:31.370]  We'll touch on that.
[26:31.370 --> 26:32.650]  Not very much.
[26:32.650 --> 26:36.450]  Now, I said create an undesirable environment for the bugs.
[26:36.450 --> 26:38.350]  I've said before that we're creating Jamaica
[26:38.350 --> 26:39.190]  in our grow space.
[26:39.190 --> 26:40.530]  We've got the perfect VPD.
[26:40.530 --> 26:41.370]  The temp is great.
[26:41.370 --> 26:42.710]  The humidity is great.
[26:42.710 --> 26:44.790]  Just enough wind to make it comfortable.
[26:44.790 --> 26:45.630]  We don't disrupt it.
[26:45.630 --> 26:48.370]  There's no predators in there unless you've introduced some.
[26:48.370 --> 26:50.010]  So, let's make an environment
[26:50.010 --> 26:52.250]  that is undesirable for these bugs.
[26:52.250 --> 26:55.730]  Maybe occasionally, you can just mist the plants with water.
[26:55.730 --> 26:56.590]  They don't like water.
[26:56.590 --> 27:00.050]  A lot of the bugs don't want to hang out if it's too humid.
[27:00.050 --> 27:02.330]  90% of our bugs are going to be
[27:02.330 --> 27:03.770]  on the underside of the leaf.
[27:03.770 --> 27:05.770]  The top of the leaf, you don't have to spray it.
[27:05.770 --> 27:07.010]  They're going to be on the bottom.
[27:07.010 --> 27:08.570]  So, come from the underside of the plant
[27:08.570 --> 27:10.530]  with your little mister, with your spray bottle,
[27:10.530 --> 27:11.530]  and just start at the bottom
[27:11.530 --> 27:13.090]  and work your way up under the plant.
[27:13.090 --> 27:15.310]  Lift up the leaves as you go and spray the underside.
[27:15.310 --> 27:17.010]  Make it undesirable.
[27:17.010 --> 27:18.550]  If you want to add a product,
[27:18.550 --> 27:20.890]  you can put in some sort of insecticidal soap,
[27:20.890 --> 27:22.370]  or you can step up your game
[27:22.370 --> 27:25.850]  and start actually using a pesticide as a preventative.
[27:25.850 --> 27:27.010]  There is no problem,
[27:27.010 --> 27:30.130]  and I highly recommend using a spray application
[27:30.130 --> 27:34.890]  of pesticides on a weekly basis to keep bugs at bay.
[27:34.890 --> 27:37.090]  So, some of the first steps are to prep the room.
[27:37.090 --> 27:39.450]  The next step is to have a standard operating procedure
[27:39.450 --> 27:42.290]  so that you don't bring bugs in through the soil,
[27:42.290 --> 27:43.970]  through your plants, or through your clothes.
[27:43.970 --> 27:47.090]  Then, we start creating an undesirable environment
[27:47.090 --> 27:48.290]  for the bugs.
[27:48.290 --> 27:51.050]  A little bit of defoliation, a little bit of wind,
[27:51.050 --> 27:52.810]  maybe some moisture on the leaves.
[27:52.810 --> 27:55.010]  Maybe, I recommend start applying
[27:55.010 --> 27:57.730]  a foliar-fed pest application,
[27:57.730 --> 28:00.410]  some sort of pesticide targeted for the bugs
[28:00.410 --> 28:03.250]  you know you are going to get in your area.
[28:03.250 --> 28:05.090]  I would recommend doing preventative sprays
[28:05.090 --> 28:06.490]  on a weekly basis.
[28:06.490 --> 28:07.990]  Rotate your products.
[28:07.990 --> 28:10.930]  Then, if you do see a pest problem start to arise,
[28:10.930 --> 28:13.730]  then increase the interval, the amount of sprays.
[28:13.730 --> 28:15.910]  Increase the amount of spray that you put in the mix.
[28:15.910 --> 28:17.950]  Then, maybe start doing rotations
[28:17.950 --> 28:21.250]  of a stronger pesticide more frequently.
[28:21.250 --> 28:23.850]  Now, I do recommend a rotation of pesticides
[28:23.850 --> 28:27.930]  because these bugs will develop a resistance to pesticides.
[28:27.930 --> 28:30.570]  Think about if I walked in your grow space every day
[28:30.570 --> 28:31.890]  and tapped you on the shoulder
[28:31.890 --> 28:34.070]  and threw just a shitty left jab at you.
[28:34.070 --> 28:36.570]  By day three, you're gonna block that left jab.
[28:36.570 --> 28:38.530]  Here comes the jab, tap you on the shoulder,
[28:38.530 --> 28:40.550]  you're gonna turn on, your block will already be up.
[28:40.550 --> 28:43.130]  You'll be ready to block my left jab, no problem.
[28:43.130 --> 28:44.890]  If I came in there on day four,
[28:44.890 --> 28:47.610]  tapped you on the shoulder, threw a vicious right cross,
[28:47.610 --> 28:48.990]  you're not gonna be ready for that shit.
[28:48.990 --> 28:49.850]  It's gonna get you.
[28:49.850 --> 28:52.350]  We've gotta do that to the spider mites also.
[28:52.350 --> 28:54.730]  They do learn, they do start to build up resistance.
[28:54.730 --> 28:56.630]  They are evolutionary creatures.
[28:56.630 --> 28:58.550]  They will say, oh, you sprayed evergreen on me
[28:58.550 --> 28:59.850]  three days in a row.
[28:59.850 --> 29:02.070]  Watch this, day four, the bugs that live
[29:02.070 --> 29:03.830]  from the first three days of evergreen,
[29:03.830 --> 29:05.430]  they're gonna lick their arm and they'll go,
[29:05.430 --> 29:07.810]  ah, evergreen, and they're just gonna look at you
[29:07.810 --> 29:09.190]  like they're fucking crazy.
[29:09.190 --> 29:11.670]  They're gonna eat up the evergreen and get stronger from it.
[29:11.670 --> 29:13.810]  So I recommend a rotation of products.
[29:13.810 --> 29:16.550]  I will go through a list of products that I do recommend.
[29:16.550 --> 29:17.690]  Once again, nobody pays me,
[29:17.690 --> 29:20.110]  they're just shit that I know that works.
[29:20.110 --> 29:22.950]  Let's talk about some of the pests
[29:22.950 --> 29:25.430]  that you will encounter in your indoor grow.
[29:25.430 --> 29:26.910]  Let me do that disclaimer once again.
[29:26.910 --> 29:28.350]  This is gonna be mostly indoors.
[29:28.350 --> 29:29.630]  I'm an indoor grower.
[29:29.630 --> 29:31.910]  I do have a greenhouse, a couple of greenhouses.
[29:31.910 --> 29:32.750]  What, did I say that?
[29:32.750 --> 29:35.990]  Got some greenhouses going, but most of this is indoor stuff.
[29:35.990 --> 29:39.510]  What bugs are we gonna get indoors in our garden?
[29:39.510 --> 29:42.150]  Most commonly, we are going to see spider mites,
[29:42.150 --> 29:43.470]  the dreaded spider mites.
[29:43.470 --> 29:44.550]  Spider mites are scary.
[29:44.550 --> 29:46.850]  A lot of people think they're a huge deal.
[29:46.850 --> 29:48.470]  It's a fucked up situation,
[29:48.470 --> 29:50.870]  depending on the stage of growth which you are in,
[29:50.870 --> 29:53.310]  but spider mites are very easy to get rid of.
[29:53.310 --> 29:55.170]  If you are patient, have a strategy,
[29:55.170 --> 29:56.950]  and understand what you are doing,
[29:56.950 --> 29:58.270]  and you're not lazy about it.
[29:58.270 --> 30:00.070]  You cannot be lazy in the grow.
[30:00.070 --> 30:01.190]  The bugs will take over.
[30:01.190 --> 30:04.410]  If you get lazy, they'll start fucking challenging you.
[30:04.410 --> 30:07.430]  Basically, you're gonna see the two-spotted mite.
[30:07.430 --> 30:09.570]  The real problem is the russet mite.
[30:09.570 --> 30:12.590]  If you've got russet mites, that changes everything.
[30:12.590 --> 30:14.270]  I do consulting.
[30:14.270 --> 30:17.450]  My consultation includes pest eradication in your grow.
[30:17.450 --> 30:20.410]  If you've got russet mites, I do charge you another level
[30:20.410 --> 30:22.010]  to get rid of those in a commercial grow.
[30:22.010 --> 30:22.850]  It's more expensive.
[30:22.850 --> 30:23.770]  It takes a lot more work.
[30:23.770 --> 30:25.290]  It's a lot more strategy,
[30:25.290 --> 30:27.610]  a lot more cooperation from the team.
[30:27.610 --> 30:29.370]  So we've got spider mites.
[30:29.370 --> 30:32.110]  Another thing you may see are thrips.
[30:32.110 --> 30:33.330]  People get scared of thrips.
[30:33.330 --> 30:35.490]  People have a lot, it takes them a long time to identify
[30:35.490 --> 30:37.290]  that it's actually a thrip issue.
[30:37.290 --> 30:38.130]  Thrips are easy.
[30:38.130 --> 30:39.390]  We can definitely get rid of thrips.
[30:39.390 --> 30:41.850]  Aphids, you may see aphids in your grow.
[30:41.850 --> 30:42.970]  Aphids of all colors.
[30:42.970 --> 30:44.490]  Aphids have become like fucking Skittles.
[30:44.490 --> 30:45.530]  They're every color now,
[30:45.530 --> 30:48.290]  through evolution and through regional evolution,
[30:48.290 --> 30:51.170]  I guess it is, there are aphids of every fucking color.
[30:51.170 --> 30:52.010]  You'll see them.
[30:52.010 --> 30:52.830]  They're not a big deal.
[30:52.830 --> 30:54.650]  We can get rid of those as well.
[30:54.650 --> 30:57.210]  Fungus gnats are very common in a grow environment.
[30:57.210 --> 30:59.030]  Those are very, very easy to get rid of.
[30:59.030 --> 31:02.250]  Not very problematic, but they can lead to other problems.
[31:02.250 --> 31:04.930]  They can be, if you've got a small problem,
[31:04.930 --> 31:06.850]  plus fungus gnats, those two together
[31:06.850 --> 31:08.650]  compound a problem very well.
[31:08.650 --> 31:10.290]  Another common issue is whiteflies.
[31:10.290 --> 31:13.690]  A lot of people will get whiteflies indoors and outdoors.
[31:13.690 --> 31:15.690]  Those are very easy to eradicate.
[31:15.690 --> 31:17.670]  Another big issue that's not a bug per se,
[31:17.670 --> 31:20.610]  but does happen quite often is powdery mildew.
[31:20.610 --> 31:22.010]  Especially here in Colorado,
[31:22.010 --> 31:25.550]  we get huge temperature swings, temperature spikes.
[31:25.550 --> 31:26.910]  Last year in the winter,
[31:26.910 --> 31:29.210]  we had negative 17 degree temperatures.
[31:29.210 --> 31:32.170]  Try keeping your grow room warm inside
[31:32.170 --> 31:33.730]  with the wall right here.
[31:33.730 --> 31:34.930]  And then on the other side of that wall,
[31:34.930 --> 31:37.030]  it's fucking negative 17 degrees.
[31:37.030 --> 31:39.050]  There's snow packed up against the walls
[31:39.050 --> 31:41.250]  and you're just trying to balance the shit out in the rooms.
[31:41.250 --> 31:43.330]  There's condensation raining from the fucking ceiling.
[31:43.970 --> 31:44.810]  It's very interesting.
[31:44.810 --> 31:45.630]  At that time of year,
[31:45.630 --> 31:47.090]  we do get powdery mildew from that show.
[31:47.090 --> 31:48.370]  So be prepared.
[31:49.630 --> 31:50.610]  Let's talk about outdoor.
[31:50.610 --> 31:52.690]  Outdoors is totally different, you guys.
[31:52.690 --> 31:54.610]  I am not super experienced with the outdoor,
[31:54.610 --> 31:57.170]  but outdoor, you may experience birds.
[31:57.170 --> 31:58.350]  Birds could be problematic.
[31:58.350 --> 31:59.730]  I've seen birds steal buds,
[31:59.730 --> 32:02.170]  just fly down and pinch little pieces of the weed
[32:02.170 --> 32:05.610]  off the weed plant all season long and just destroy plants.
[32:05.610 --> 32:08.010]  Deer, deer will come and eat your whole fucking plant.
[32:08.010 --> 32:09.170]  I've seen bears come.
[32:09.170 --> 32:10.270]  I haven't seen them personally.
[32:10.270 --> 32:12.410]  I've seen instances where bears have come
[32:12.490 --> 32:14.650]  and stolen plants from the grow.
[32:14.650 --> 32:16.010]  Bunnies are notorious.
[32:16.010 --> 32:17.370]  If you got too many rabbits,
[32:17.370 --> 32:19.210]  they'll eat the shit out of your plants.
[32:19.210 --> 32:21.250]  In Colorado, we get these caterpillars.
[32:21.250 --> 32:23.410]  We get moths that land in the plants.
[32:23.410 --> 32:26.670]  They lay eggs and those turn into these orange caterpillars.
[32:26.670 --> 32:28.010]  Those things have fucking ruined
[32:28.010 --> 32:29.930]  so many crops of people that I know.
[32:29.930 --> 32:32.090]  So you're gonna get a lot of outdoor bugs.
[32:33.010 --> 32:35.890]  Oh, another thing we should think about outdoors is thieves.
[32:35.890 --> 32:38.110]  We get a lot of thieves, especially here in Colorado,
[32:38.110 --> 32:39.210]  especially here in Pueblo.
[32:39.210 --> 32:41.170]  People love to steal your outdoor weeds.
[32:41.170 --> 32:43.050]  So if you're gonna plant outdoor weed,
[32:43.050 --> 32:44.930]  plant one for the crook, one for the bugs,
[32:44.930 --> 32:46.090]  one for the bunnies,
[32:46.090 --> 32:48.810]  and then maybe you'll get one for yourself also.
[32:48.810 --> 32:50.210]  I'm hoping you get the best.
[32:50.210 --> 32:51.850]  I'm being optimistic.
[32:51.850 --> 32:54.330]  I've done a full episode on bud washing.
[32:54.330 --> 32:57.650]  If you do grow outdoors, your outdoor weed may be very dirty.
[32:57.650 --> 32:59.110]  There may be some bugs in there.
[32:59.110 --> 33:00.850]  I've done an episode on bud washing.
[33:00.850 --> 33:03.170]  Maybe check out the bud washing episode.
[33:03.170 --> 33:04.370]  That may be a good episode
[33:04.370 --> 33:05.990]  for rinsing off your outdoor weed.
[33:05.990 --> 33:08.290]  A lot of people are, that's really controversial.
[33:08.290 --> 33:09.250]  I think it's a good show.
[33:09.250 --> 33:10.090]  Check that out.
[33:10.090 --> 33:10.910]  I digress.
[33:11.750 --> 33:13.910]  I'm gonna get more into integrated pest management.
[33:13.910 --> 33:15.910]  We've talked about the bugs that we're going to face.
[33:15.910 --> 33:17.950]  We're gonna face spider mites, thrips, aphids,
[33:17.950 --> 33:21.470]  fungus gnats, white flies, possibly powdery mildew.
[33:21.470 --> 33:23.290]  There are other things that a lot of the grow books
[33:23.290 --> 33:24.550]  talk about that do pop up.
[33:24.550 --> 33:27.330]  Honestly, mealy bugs and scales and shit like that
[33:27.330 --> 33:28.990]  is very, very uncommon.
[33:28.990 --> 33:30.270]  I've been growing for a thousand years.
[33:30.270 --> 33:33.150]  It feels like I've never seen a mealy bug or a scale.
[33:33.150 --> 33:36.030]  So we're not gonna worry too much about that.
[33:36.030 --> 33:38.250]  Let's talk about now about options
[33:38.250 --> 33:40.530]  on how to get rid of these bugs.
[33:41.130 --> 33:42.570]  We've talked about ways to kind of prevent them.
[33:42.570 --> 33:44.930]  Let's talk about ways to get rid of them.
[33:44.930 --> 33:47.270]  I am a commercial ganja grower.
[33:47.270 --> 33:48.970]  I like to grow in large warehouses
[33:48.970 --> 33:51.170]  with large plants with a lot of toys.
[33:51.170 --> 33:54.090]  The way that I prefer in my method
[33:54.090 --> 33:55.650]  to get rid of and prevent bugs
[33:55.650 --> 34:00.250]  is a rotation of pesticide applications and a spray method.
[34:00.250 --> 34:03.210]  Sprayed pesticide applications are my favorite.
[34:03.210 --> 34:05.210]  A lot of people out there don't agree with that.
[34:05.210 --> 34:06.810]  They don't wanna smoke pesticides.
[34:06.810 --> 34:08.450]  They don't wanna smoke chemicals,
[34:08.450 --> 34:11.330]  but everything is chemicals if you understand that.
[34:11.330 --> 34:12.990]  And I understand that you may not wanna consume
[34:12.990 --> 34:16.130]  some pesticides, but we've got to do what we've got to do
[34:16.130 --> 34:18.970]  to keep the bugs away, to protect our investment,
[34:18.970 --> 34:20.930]  to make sure that you are delivered a product.
[34:20.930 --> 34:25.210]  And my job as the lead cultivator, the consultant,
[34:25.210 --> 34:27.130]  also somebody trained by the Colorado
[34:27.130 --> 34:30.370]  Department of Agriculture, it's my job, my responsibility.
[34:30.370 --> 34:34.070]  Also somebody who is highly passionate about cannabis.
[34:34.070 --> 34:36.290]  I'm not just a grower, I'm not just a breeder.
[34:36.290 --> 34:37.230]  I love to smoke.
[34:37.230 --> 34:39.150]  The root of all of this, it all started
[34:39.150 --> 34:40.510]  because I love to smoke ganja.
[34:40.510 --> 34:42.110]  I'm a cannabis consumer.
[34:42.110 --> 34:44.630]  I'm going to smoke everything that we grow
[34:44.630 --> 34:47.670]  at my commercial facility, so I keep that in mind.
[34:47.670 --> 34:50.910]  I'm also very passionate about cannabis consumers
[34:50.910 --> 34:52.050]  and cannabis patients.
[34:52.050 --> 34:54.510]  I come from the medical marijuana side of cannabis
[34:54.510 --> 34:55.950]  is where I got started.
[34:55.950 --> 34:58.450]  I wanna make sure not to get anybody sicker
[34:58.450 --> 34:59.450]  than they already are.
[34:59.450 --> 35:01.390]  I don't wanna make anybody sick at all.
[35:01.390 --> 35:03.510]  The goal for my cannabis that I grow
[35:03.510 --> 35:04.990]  is for people to feel better,
[35:04.990 --> 35:06.710]  to have a better quality of life
[35:07.190 --> 35:09.670]  after they consume the product that I produced.
[35:09.670 --> 35:14.670]  So not only am I professionally and ethically responsible,
[35:15.150 --> 35:17.790]  but I'm also personally and passionately invested
[35:17.790 --> 35:20.430]  in making sure that these products are safe.
[35:20.430 --> 35:22.790]  So one of my big jobs in the facility
[35:22.790 --> 35:25.430]  is to make sure that we are safely, ethically,
[35:25.430 --> 35:28.170]  and effectively using the correct products
[35:28.170 --> 35:30.710]  at the correct time to get rid of bugs,
[35:30.710 --> 35:33.430]  but also not contaminate any of the product
[35:33.430 --> 35:35.350]  to where it could be problematic for anybody
[35:35.350 --> 35:39.110]  who may consume the buds, the edibles, the concentrates,
[35:39.110 --> 35:40.990]  anything that comes out of my grow.
[35:40.990 --> 35:42.190]  I am responsible for that.
[35:42.190 --> 35:43.490]  My name is on that product.
[35:43.490 --> 35:45.710]  If you look at the jar where the herb came from,
[35:45.710 --> 35:48.590]  it will tell you the number where that product was produced
[35:48.590 --> 35:49.670]  here in Colorado.
[35:49.670 --> 35:50.730]  And if you know the numbers
[35:50.730 --> 35:51.870]  and you know the right facilities,
[35:51.870 --> 35:53.110]  you know who grew that shit.
[35:53.110 --> 35:55.790]  You could say this was a Rasta Jeff grow, you can find it.
[35:55.790 --> 35:57.110]  And you can fucking call me out
[35:57.110 --> 35:59.990]  and blame me for whatever you need to blame me for.
[35:59.990 --> 36:02.350]  So I know I do talk a lot about the business side
[36:02.350 --> 36:04.270]  of commercially producing cannabis.
[36:04.270 --> 36:05.270]  It's a big investment.
[36:05.270 --> 36:06.950]  It's a lot of responsibility,
[36:06.950 --> 36:09.110]  but please never feel like I've forgotten
[36:09.110 --> 36:11.710]  about the patients, about the consumers,
[36:11.710 --> 36:13.990]  about the people that sparked this passion
[36:13.990 --> 36:17.550]  for a large-scale cannabis production in me.
[36:17.550 --> 36:19.950]  I grow cannabis to make people feel better.
[36:19.950 --> 36:22.070]  I breed cannabis to make people feel better.
[36:22.070 --> 36:24.230]  That is the overall goal of this here.
[36:24.230 --> 36:25.970]  I have not lost sight of that goal.
[36:25.970 --> 36:27.870]  I am involved in a lot of things.
[36:27.870 --> 36:29.190]  I have gone very far
[36:29.190 --> 36:31.070]  from the original root of this project,
[36:31.070 --> 36:33.750]  but I know that the original,
[36:33.750 --> 36:35.710]  the whole mission, the intent,
[36:35.710 --> 36:37.710]  is to make people feel better.
[36:37.710 --> 36:40.710]  And I know that giving you a pesticide on your product
[36:40.710 --> 36:42.230]  is not going to make you feel better.
[36:42.230 --> 36:45.150]  I want you to live longer, healthier, happier,
[36:45.150 --> 36:46.830]  and I can't do that if I poison you
[36:46.830 --> 36:47.950]  with the fucking pesticide.
[36:47.950 --> 36:50.170]  So one of my big things is to make sure
[36:50.170 --> 36:52.630]  that we are doing this ethically and responsibly.
[36:52.630 --> 36:54.670]  That is something I take good pride in.
[36:54.670 --> 36:56.670]  So I do talk about sprayed applications.
[36:56.670 --> 36:58.690]  A lot of people are not into the sprays.
[36:58.690 --> 36:59.530]  That is cool.
[36:59.530 --> 37:00.450]  Do your thing.
[37:00.450 --> 37:01.970]  How are you keeping the bugs away
[37:01.970 --> 37:04.310]  if you're not using a sprayed application?
[37:04.310 --> 37:07.330]  A lot of people will choose to use predator insects.
[37:07.330 --> 37:09.950]  They get other bugs that do not harm the plants,
[37:09.950 --> 37:13.170]  but they do eat the bugs that are there in the grow.
[37:13.170 --> 37:15.690]  So you can get things like lacewings,
[37:15.690 --> 37:18.930]  swarskies, persimilis, hypoaspis miles,
[37:18.930 --> 37:21.130]  rove beetles, assassin beetles,
[37:21.130 --> 37:23.010]  things like that, and you buy them,
[37:23.010 --> 37:23.850]  and they come in the mail,
[37:23.850 --> 37:25.570]  and you release them in the grow,
[37:25.570 --> 37:27.930]  and those will go and act just like predators.
[37:27.930 --> 37:30.170]  Out in the wild, they'll eat all of your fucking spider mites,
[37:30.890 --> 37:31.730]  all of your fungus gnats.
[37:31.730 --> 37:34.570]  A lot of people do choose to use ladybugs.
[37:34.570 --> 37:36.570]  Let me talk about ladybugs briefly.
[37:36.570 --> 37:37.770]  I think they're lazy.
[37:37.770 --> 37:40.770]  They're cool if there's, like, bugs are right here.
[37:40.770 --> 37:42.330]  A ladybug may go over here and eat it,
[37:42.330 --> 37:44.530]  but if there's a bug over here and a ladybug over here,
[37:44.530 --> 37:46.430]  a ladybug's not going anywhere to fucking eat it,
[37:46.430 --> 37:48.010]  in my experience.
[37:48.010 --> 37:49.610]  You'll spend money on ladybugs.
[37:49.610 --> 37:51.610]  You'll release them into the grow.
[37:51.610 --> 37:52.810]  You'll take a bunch of pictures,
[37:52.810 --> 37:53.630]  because they're gorgeous.
[37:53.630 --> 37:54.930]  You'll find a couple that are humping.
[37:54.930 --> 37:56.870]  There's always ladybugs humping.
[37:56.870 --> 37:58.530]  You'll find them up on the tops of the plants.
[37:58.530 --> 38:00.010]  You'll take a bunch of great photos,
[38:00.850 --> 38:01.690]  and you'll turn off the lights,
[38:01.690 --> 38:02.510]  and you'll go do your business,
[38:02.510 --> 38:03.350]  and you come in the next day,
[38:03.350 --> 38:04.490]  half the ladybugs will be dead.
[38:04.490 --> 38:05.650]  They flew into the fucking light.
[38:05.650 --> 38:06.530]  They flew into the fan.
[38:06.530 --> 38:07.910]  They flew into the blower.
[38:07.910 --> 38:08.810]  Ladybugs are pretty,
[38:08.810 --> 38:10.730]  but they are not the smartest fucking creature
[38:10.730 --> 38:11.570]  on the planet.
[38:11.570 --> 38:12.410]  They're suicidal.
[38:12.410 --> 38:13.730]  They're kamikaze.
[38:13.730 --> 38:14.790]  They don't last very long.
[38:14.790 --> 38:16.170]  They stink.
[38:16.170 --> 38:17.010]  They die.
[38:17.010 --> 38:18.130]  They land on the floor, and they stink.
[38:18.130 --> 38:20.790]  In my opinion, that smell from the dead ladybugs
[38:20.790 --> 38:21.630]  is terrible.
[38:21.630 --> 38:23.010]  Then you gotta sweep them all up,
[38:23.010 --> 38:24.690]  and it's kind of a waste of money.
[38:24.690 --> 38:26.550]  I would recommend a more aggressive,
[38:26.550 --> 38:28.650]  more effective predator.
[38:28.650 --> 38:31.410]  Californicus, swarski, that may be the same thing.
[38:31.410 --> 38:32.690]  They changed the names on these bugs,
[38:32.690 --> 38:35.090]  and I can't keep the Latin names all straight in my mind.
[38:35.090 --> 38:36.130]  I order them honestly,
[38:36.130 --> 38:38.050]  and I can remember the names that I order.
[38:38.050 --> 38:41.210]  The swarskis, the kookamaris, the californicus,
[38:41.210 --> 38:43.770]  the hypoaspis miles, green lacewings,
[38:43.770 --> 38:46.210]  rove beetles, what's the other one that I said?
[38:46.210 --> 38:47.850]  Assassin beetles.
[38:47.850 --> 38:50.810]  Those are all great predator beetles or predator bugs,
[38:50.810 --> 38:53.450]  but just like a pesticide,
[38:53.450 --> 38:56.150]  what I'm about to say applies to predator insects
[38:56.150 --> 38:57.490]  and pesticides.
[38:57.530 --> 39:00.930]  You've got to have the correct eradication device
[39:00.930 --> 39:03.530]  for the correct problem.
[39:03.530 --> 39:06.890]  If you go releasing the wrong bug for the wrong bug,
[39:06.890 --> 39:08.050]  they may never meet up,
[39:08.050 --> 39:10.510]  but if you know what bugs you're facing,
[39:10.510 --> 39:12.370]  and you do the right research,
[39:12.370 --> 39:14.490]  you can find the correct bug to go in there
[39:14.490 --> 39:16.290]  and get that bug right away.
[39:16.290 --> 39:18.970]  The problem is, in my opinion, with the predator bugs
[39:18.970 --> 39:21.470]  is that you've gotta build up populations.
[39:21.470 --> 39:24.530]  On the same hand, it does take time, effort, and energy
[39:24.530 --> 39:26.170]  to spray a pesticide,
[39:26.170 --> 39:28.210]  and it does do some stress to the plants.
[39:28.210 --> 39:29.250]  If you're letting out bugs,
[39:29.250 --> 39:31.390]  the plants barely know that those bugs are there,
[39:31.390 --> 39:33.210]  but it does take a little while for that army
[39:33.210 --> 39:34.530]  to get out there and start doing work.
[39:34.530 --> 39:36.970]  So you've got your toss up there, your 50-50.
[39:36.970 --> 39:40.690]  Let's talk about another way to get rid of bugs in our grow.
[39:40.690 --> 39:43.610]  Many people forget that a lot of the bugs we face
[39:43.610 --> 39:45.630]  are not on the leaves of the plant.
[39:45.630 --> 39:47.770]  They actually live down in the soil,
[39:47.770 --> 39:50.130]  the cocoa, the medium, that's where they go.
[39:50.130 --> 39:51.850]  You may see them pop up occasionally
[39:51.850 --> 39:52.850]  and show you that they're there,
[39:52.850 --> 39:54.770]  but they're living down in the soil.
[39:54.770 --> 39:57.710]  So a soil dredge is another very effective way
[39:57.710 --> 40:00.570]  to get rid of many of the bugs we face.
[40:00.570 --> 40:03.810]  Oftentimes, if we've got a bug, if it's thrips,
[40:03.810 --> 40:06.770]  spider mites, fungus gnats, white flies,
[40:06.770 --> 40:10.170]  a lot of the time, my first reaction is to defoliate.
[40:10.170 --> 40:11.570]  Let's just get rid of some of these leaves,
[40:11.570 --> 40:13.770]  clean up the bottoms, take off a bunch of leaves.
[40:13.770 --> 40:15.950]  That's gonna help us out, that's the first step.
[40:15.950 --> 40:18.350]  Then the next step, let's do a soil dredge
[40:18.350 --> 40:19.770]  of the appropriate product.
[40:19.770 --> 40:22.490]  If I've got, let's just say if I've got fungus gnats,
[40:22.490 --> 40:27.090]  I would use 15 to 30 milliliters of evergreen
[40:27.090 --> 40:29.450]  per gallon of water as a soil dredge.
[40:29.450 --> 40:30.890]  I would run that right through the pot,
[40:30.890 --> 40:33.610]  right through the soil until I get a little bit of runoff.
[40:33.610 --> 40:35.170]  That way I know that all that soil in there
[40:35.170 --> 40:36.510]  has now been poisoned.
[40:36.510 --> 40:38.770]  Any fungus gnats in there are gonna get poisoned,
[40:38.770 --> 40:41.290]  they're gonna die, they're not gonna wanna live in there.
[40:41.290 --> 40:43.890]  Now the next move, I would spray the plants
[40:43.890 --> 40:47.990]  with 15 to 30 milliliters per gallon of evergreen.
[40:47.990 --> 40:50.670]  It's down there in the soil, let's get it up top also.
[40:50.670 --> 40:52.430]  That way we killed everything.
[40:53.270 --> 40:54.110]  If there are bugs on the leaves,
[40:54.110 --> 40:55.830]  they're gonna run to the soil looking for refuge.
[40:55.830 --> 40:57.610]  Guess what, poison down there.
[40:57.610 --> 40:58.990]  If there are bugs in the soil,
[40:58.990 --> 41:00.990]  they're gonna run up to the leaves looking for refuge.
[41:00.990 --> 41:02.850]  Guess what, poison up there.
[41:02.850 --> 41:04.690]  Let's get them, let's get them on all levels.
[41:04.690 --> 41:06.670]  Let's not give them anywhere to hide.
[41:06.670 --> 41:08.650]  And one thing I wanna talk about is fungus gnats,
[41:08.650 --> 41:10.630]  those are there because you're over watering.
[41:10.630 --> 41:12.310]  If you stop over watering,
[41:12.310 --> 41:14.250]  the fungus gnats will stop coming around.
[41:14.250 --> 41:15.850]  So those should be easy to get rid of.
[41:15.850 --> 41:17.990]  Fungus gnats, quickly, how do you get rid of fungus gnats?
[41:17.990 --> 41:21.810]  Defoliate, do a soil dredge of either,
[41:21.850 --> 41:22.850]  I would just say evergreen.
[41:22.850 --> 41:24.210]  Let's just start off right with evergreen.
[41:24.210 --> 41:26.410]  You could use Azitrol, Azimax,
[41:26.410 --> 41:28.490]  but I think evergreen or Pyganic,
[41:28.490 --> 41:29.690]  which is a very similar product,
[41:29.690 --> 41:32.530]  reduce the dosage of the Pyganic though.
[41:32.530 --> 41:36.410]  Give it a soil dredge, defoliate, soil dredge, foliar feed.
[41:36.410 --> 41:39.230]  Repeat in three days, fungus gnats are gone, bro.
[41:39.230 --> 41:41.030]  If you do it right, the fungus gnats will be gone.
[41:41.030 --> 41:42.890]  Maybe repeat a third time.
[41:42.890 --> 41:44.530]  The plants are gonna look a little bit stressed
[41:44.530 --> 41:46.690]  if you hit them with that much oil three times,
[41:46.690 --> 41:50.490]  but your fucking bugs will be gone.
[41:50.530 --> 41:52.050]  All right, where are we?
[41:52.890 --> 41:54.490]  Let's talk about what we can do.
[41:54.490 --> 41:56.490]  Things are really, all right,
[41:56.490 --> 41:57.810]  another thing we need to talk about
[41:57.810 --> 42:01.570]  is what phase of growth are our plants in?
[42:01.570 --> 42:04.810]  If we're in veg, we can do a lot of things to the plants.
[42:04.810 --> 42:06.490]  If you're just starting to flower,
[42:06.490 --> 42:07.810]  your options are slimming out.
[42:07.810 --> 42:10.890]  If you're in flower, your options for spray applications
[42:10.890 --> 42:12.410]  become very thin.
[42:12.410 --> 42:14.530]  Keep in mind that people are going to consume this.
[42:14.530 --> 42:16.370]  We don't wanna put a product on here
[42:16.370 --> 42:19.190]  that is not going to, the half-life is not going to come up
[42:19.190 --> 42:21.430]  by the time we consume this product.
[42:21.430 --> 42:22.470]  So keep that in mind.
[42:22.470 --> 42:24.390]  You don't wanna taste it, you don't wanna smoke it.
[42:24.390 --> 42:27.190]  You definitely don't want it in your concentrates.
[42:27.190 --> 42:29.110]  Imagine if I sprayed something on your buds
[42:29.110 --> 42:30.470]  and you taste it in the buds.
[42:30.470 --> 42:33.350]  Imagine if I put those buds in a extraction device
[42:33.350 --> 42:36.350]  of any kind, we're concentrating the pesticide,
[42:36.350 --> 42:37.550]  that shitty flavor as well.
[42:37.550 --> 42:40.630]  Your dabs are going to taste 20 times worse
[42:40.630 --> 42:41.990]  than the flowers taste.
[42:41.990 --> 42:45.110]  So think about the stage of growth you are in
[42:45.110 --> 42:48.350]  and adjust your pesticide application accordingly.
[42:48.350 --> 42:50.350]  Something I like to do in a commercial grow,
[42:50.350 --> 42:52.550]  I just said we focus on spray applications.
[42:52.550 --> 42:55.350]  Yes, as soon as I see bud set, guess what I do?
[42:55.350 --> 42:57.590]  I release a fuck ton of predator bugs.
[42:57.590 --> 43:00.030]  So I've got sprays all the way up to about day 14,
[43:00.030 --> 43:01.350]  maybe day 20.
[43:01.350 --> 43:03.890]  Then by day 21, I've got an army,
[43:03.890 --> 43:05.710]  a bunch of boxes of predator bugs
[43:05.710 --> 43:07.270]  to release into the entire grow.
[43:07.270 --> 43:10.830]  So I switch it over to predators later in the season.
[43:10.830 --> 43:13.890]  So I start off my grow season with spray applications.
[43:13.890 --> 43:17.750]  Once I get buds, I do switch over to the predator bugs.
[43:17.750 --> 43:20.750]  Then I have an arrangement with the insectary.
[43:20.750 --> 43:22.710]  We basically set up a subscription service
[43:22.710 --> 43:24.710]  to where those bugs come every week,
[43:24.710 --> 43:26.350]  every two weeks as needed,
[43:26.350 --> 43:28.010]  until I tell them that we have harvested,
[43:28.010 --> 43:29.470]  then they stop sending them.
[43:29.470 --> 43:31.830]  They just show up in a box that says live bugs.
[43:31.830 --> 43:33.590]  I just start putting them out as soon as they get there,
[43:33.590 --> 43:38.550]  build that population, keep those problem bugs away.
[43:38.550 --> 43:40.790]  Those predators do need to be planned for.
[43:40.790 --> 43:42.390]  They need to be planned ahead.
[43:42.390 --> 43:43.830]  You do need to get them there.
[43:43.830 --> 43:44.950]  It's gonna take you,
[43:44.950 --> 43:47.030]  if you're new with ordering from the insectary,
[43:47.030 --> 43:49.350]  it may take you two weeks to get your first batch,
[43:49.350 --> 43:51.550]  but after that, you'll be in the rotation.
[43:51.550 --> 43:54.030]  They may have to breed more bugs for you.
[43:54.030 --> 43:56.490]  Sometimes they're making the amount of bugs they sell.
[43:56.490 --> 43:57.830]  These people know what they're gonna sell.
[43:57.830 --> 43:59.130]  They're making that amount.
[43:59.130 --> 44:00.410]  They gotta step up their program
[44:00.410 --> 44:02.390]  to get you your order in two weeks.
[44:02.390 --> 44:03.470]  So be prepared.
[44:03.470 --> 44:05.590]  Also keep in mind delivery time.
[44:05.590 --> 44:06.510]  Also keep in mind,
[44:06.510 --> 44:09.350]  somebody's got to disperse all of these bugs,
[44:09.350 --> 44:11.990]  which is cool because you can just do the whole room
[44:11.990 --> 44:15.430]  or you can really focus on problem hotspots.
[44:15.430 --> 44:18.550]  I've come to a part in my notes where it says PPE.
[44:18.550 --> 44:20.690]  We've already talked about personal protective equipment,
[44:20.690 --> 44:21.530]  but guess what?
[44:21.530 --> 44:23.470]  Once again, be safe in the grow.
[44:23.470 --> 44:25.970]  Protect yourself, personal protective equipment,
[44:25.970 --> 44:28.530]  long sleeves, pants, shoes, goggles,
[44:28.530 --> 44:31.630]  respirator if you need it, gloves for sure.
[44:31.630 --> 44:33.290]  Maybe even a Tyvek suit.
[44:33.290 --> 44:34.790]  Come on, protect yourself.
[44:34.790 --> 44:36.550]  All right, I just wanna make sure that you're safe
[44:36.550 --> 44:38.410]  and that you go home to your kids or your dog
[44:38.410 --> 44:40.230]  or your turtle or all six of your cats
[44:40.230 --> 44:41.470]  or whatever you're doing.
[44:41.470 --> 44:43.030]  Take care of yourself.
[44:43.030 --> 44:45.190]  Now, I did say that I was going to talk a little bit
[44:45.950 --> 44:48.550]  about some of the products that I use and do recommend.
[44:48.550 --> 44:49.870]  I've got a few disclaimers here,
[44:49.870 --> 44:52.030]  a bunch of rambling to do about this.
[44:52.030 --> 44:54.110]  First one, nobody pays me.
[44:54.110 --> 44:57.590]  I'm not paid by any fucking companies for any products.
[44:57.590 --> 45:00.310]  The only sponsors, the only people that are in my pocket,
[45:00.310 --> 45:01.790]  the only people whose pocket I am in,
[45:01.790 --> 45:03.170]  whichever way that goes,
[45:03.170 --> 45:06.790]  I do have an advertising agreement with seedsherenow.com.
[45:06.790 --> 45:08.550]  I'll be transparent with that.
[45:08.550 --> 45:10.670]  If you're watching on YouTube, you don't even get that ad.
[45:10.670 --> 45:12.070]  I can't put that ad on YouTube
[45:12.070 --> 45:13.190]  because YouTube doesn't agree
[45:13.190 --> 45:15.610]  with advertising for seedsherenow.com.
[45:15.610 --> 45:17.070]  If you're listening to the audio,
[45:17.070 --> 45:19.830]  there's a seedsherenow.com commercial at the beginning.
[45:19.830 --> 45:22.310]  That's the only advertising agreement I've got arranged.
[45:22.310 --> 45:24.350]  Nobody pays me, nothing like that.
[45:24.350 --> 45:26.750]  So let's talk about the products that I do recommend.
[45:26.750 --> 45:28.670]  I talk a lot about Evergreen.
[45:28.670 --> 45:30.150]  Evergreen's a good product.
[45:30.150 --> 45:32.030]  It's a pyrethrin-based product.
[45:32.030 --> 45:35.190]  It works on a lot of problems, a lot of pests.
[45:35.190 --> 45:37.190]  It doesn't do a lot of stress to the plants.
[45:37.190 --> 45:38.630]  That's a good product.
[45:38.630 --> 45:41.030]  Another product I recommend is Azimax.
[45:41.030 --> 45:43.870]  Another product I recommend is Azitrawl.
[45:43.870 --> 45:47.270]  Something else I like a lot is Botanigard Max.
[45:47.270 --> 45:49.950]  Another product I'll recommend is Venerate.
[45:49.950 --> 45:52.990]  Something else I really like is Monterey Garden Spray.
[45:52.990 --> 45:55.390]  Monterey Garden Spray has an ingredient in there
[45:55.390 --> 45:58.750]  called spinosad, which is very effective against whiteflies.
[45:58.750 --> 46:00.190]  If you've got whiteflies,
[46:00.190 --> 46:02.510]  hit it with that Monterey Garden Spray.
[46:02.510 --> 46:05.270]  Every three days for like three or four applications,
[46:05.270 --> 46:06.870]  your whiteflies will be gone.
[46:06.870 --> 46:08.590]  You can also do the soil dredge
[46:08.590 --> 46:09.830]  with the Monterey Garden Spray.
[46:09.830 --> 46:13.550]  Get that spinosad in there, your whiteflies will disappear.
[46:13.550 --> 46:18.550]  The spinosad is a fungus, a fungus is a bacteria or fungus.
[46:18.830 --> 46:22.030]  It's a fungus that grows on the bottom of whiskey barrels,
[46:22.030 --> 46:24.270]  and they've found that that kills whiteflies
[46:24.270 --> 46:25.910]  and many other insects.
[46:25.910 --> 46:28.110]  Other products that I really enjoy are Ceese.
[46:28.110 --> 46:30.230]  I use Cease for powdery mildew.
[46:30.230 --> 46:31.990]  I also like Regalia.
[46:31.990 --> 46:33.030]  I like Double Nickel.
[46:33.030 --> 46:35.350]  I like a product called B52.
[46:35.350 --> 46:37.590]  I really like a product called Xerotol.
[46:37.630 --> 46:38.710]  It's good for a lot of things.
[46:38.710 --> 46:39.870]  You can clean with it.
[46:39.870 --> 46:41.750]  It'll help you get rid of powdery mildew.
[46:41.750 --> 46:44.630]  It creates that undesirable environment for your plants,
[46:44.630 --> 46:47.350]  and you can use it really late in the game.
[46:47.350 --> 46:49.190]  I'm not gonna give you any timeframes.
[46:49.190 --> 46:53.350]  Another product I really like is the Mammoth P Pest.
[46:53.350 --> 46:54.350]  What's it called?
[46:54.350 --> 46:57.030]  I know the name of it, my brain won't say it.
[46:57.030 --> 46:59.250]  Anyway, the people that make Mammoth P,
[46:59.250 --> 47:02.350]  Mammoth makes a pest, pesticide application.
[47:02.350 --> 47:04.110]  I know the name of it, my brain will not say it.
[47:04.110 --> 47:05.830]  Guys at Mammoth, I apologize.
[47:05.830 --> 47:07.950]  Your pesticide application is fucking great,
[47:07.950 --> 47:10.030]  and it smells wonderful, which I don't know,
[47:10.030 --> 47:10.870]  is that a good thing?
[47:10.870 --> 47:12.630]  Because I'm in there going, this smells so good,
[47:12.630 --> 47:14.030]  I'm just sucking up the pesticide.
[47:14.030 --> 47:14.870]  That could be dangerous.
[47:14.870 --> 47:18.770]  But there's a Mammoth insect control product.
[47:18.770 --> 47:20.350]  My brain will not, I apologize,
[47:20.350 --> 47:21.670]  because it's a good product, whatever.
[47:21.670 --> 47:22.750]  Whatever the name of that shit is,
[47:22.750 --> 47:25.830]  Google Mammoth pesticide, it'll come up.
[47:27.670 --> 47:29.790]  One thing I want to recommend is do not use,
[47:29.790 --> 47:33.010]  I do not recommend using botanical oils.
[47:34.310 --> 47:35.630]  You see them at all the growth stores,
[47:36.470 --> 47:38.110]  all the hydro stores, they're in pretty colored bottles.
[47:38.110 --> 47:39.430]  There's a purple one, a pink one,
[47:39.430 --> 47:42.150]  one's got lavender, one's got rosemary and shit in it.
[47:42.150 --> 47:44.510]  I do not like those.
[47:44.510 --> 47:46.390]  That flavor ends up in your buds,
[47:46.390 --> 47:47.430]  and it doesn't taste good.
[47:47.430 --> 47:49.430]  Have you ever tasted perfume?
[47:49.430 --> 47:51.910]  Like when somebody sprays perfume or cologne in the room
[47:51.910 --> 47:53.010]  and you can taste it?
[47:53.010 --> 47:54.870]  That's what botanical oils taste like
[47:54.870 --> 47:56.330]  when you smoke the bud.
[47:56.330 --> 47:58.390]  That's what they taste like when you make concentrates.
[47:58.390 --> 48:00.150]  Don't put that shit in there, please.
[48:00.150 --> 48:03.570]  Also, I do not like neem oil at all.
[48:03.570 --> 48:04.890]  Get rid of that shit.
[48:04.890 --> 48:06.370]  Now something I do need to touch on,
[48:06.370 --> 48:08.330]  being that I am certified by
[48:08.330 --> 48:11.250]  the Colorado Department of Agriculture to be,
[48:11.250 --> 48:13.130]  let me explain my credentials here
[48:13.130 --> 48:14.210]  since we're in the middle of a fucking
[48:14.210 --> 48:16.530]  pesticide application podcast.
[48:16.530 --> 48:19.850]  My certification comes from the Colorado State University,
[48:19.850 --> 48:22.410]  also the Colorado Department of Agriculture.
[48:22.410 --> 48:24.170]  I took a class at the university,
[48:24.170 --> 48:25.250]  and I was given the license
[48:25.250 --> 48:27.250]  by the Colorado Department of Agriculture.
[48:27.250 --> 48:29.010]  I've got license number 17.
[48:29.010 --> 48:33.050]  I'm 017 in the Train the Trainer certification program.
[48:33.090 --> 48:35.370]  I was trained by a great person named Thea Walker.
[48:35.370 --> 48:37.450]  She gave a great class, good teacher,
[48:37.450 --> 48:39.250]  very personable person.
[48:39.250 --> 48:40.250]  So I am certified.
[48:40.250 --> 48:41.690]  I am Train the Trainer certified,
[48:41.690 --> 48:43.930]  which means I can go to a commercial grow,
[48:43.930 --> 48:46.210]  whether it's a farm, whether it's a weed grow,
[48:46.210 --> 48:47.890]  if it's tomatoes, if it's soy,
[48:47.890 --> 48:50.970]  and I can train the crew and the lead grower
[48:50.970 --> 48:53.930]  in safe pesticide management,
[48:53.930 --> 48:56.530]  application, handling, and education.
[48:56.530 --> 48:59.190]  I am certified by the university
[48:59.190 --> 49:00.710]  and the Department of Ag to do this.
[49:00.710 --> 49:01.810]  I've got paperwork.
[49:01.810 --> 49:05.050]  So I am qualified to give this pesticide information.
[49:05.050 --> 49:06.610]  Something I wanna touch on right now
[49:06.610 --> 49:08.650]  is all of the products I recommend,
[49:08.650 --> 49:11.210]  all of the methodology I've recommended
[49:11.210 --> 49:14.210]  is legal here in Colorado in a commercial grow.
[49:14.210 --> 49:18.430]  I think actually Azimax may have been banned recently,
[49:18.430 --> 49:20.650]  but most of the products I recommended
[49:20.650 --> 49:23.690]  are legal and safe here in the state of Colorado.
[49:23.690 --> 49:25.130]  I don't know where you are.
[49:25.130 --> 49:26.130]  I don't know the laws.
[49:26.130 --> 49:27.690]  We have to work with the
[49:27.690 --> 49:30.050]  Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division,
[49:30.050 --> 49:32.850]  the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment,
[49:32.850 --> 49:35.250]  the Colorado Department of Agriculture,
[49:35.250 --> 49:38.110]  and probably other entities that I'm not even aware of.
[49:38.110 --> 49:40.090]  They've got to approve every pesticide
[49:40.090 --> 49:41.950]  that we use on our products.
[49:41.950 --> 49:44.530]  So make sure that the products you are using
[49:44.530 --> 49:48.490]  are approved by your state regulators.
[49:48.490 --> 49:50.290]  I don't know what state you're in.
[49:50.290 --> 49:52.250]  I don't know what products you're using.
[49:52.250 --> 49:53.690]  Don't blame it on me.
[49:53.690 --> 49:54.930]  You've got to do that work.
[49:54.930 --> 49:57.370]  I'm telling you what I use, what I recommend.
[49:57.370 --> 49:58.770]  Don't let me ruin your license.
[49:58.770 --> 50:00.730]  Don't let me fuck up your plans.
[50:00.730 --> 50:03.110]  Don't get in trouble because of me.
[50:03.110 --> 50:06.090]  Also, I try in my personal grow
[50:06.090 --> 50:08.290]  to stick to those same standards
[50:08.290 --> 50:10.930]  that are held by the commercial grow.
[50:10.930 --> 50:12.490]  Sometimes I'm a little bit more strict,
[50:12.490 --> 50:15.450]  but also, full disclosure, when I get new clones in,
[50:15.450 --> 50:17.890]  I spray it with shit that I will not even tell you
[50:17.890 --> 50:19.970]  because it's not gonna be consumed.
[50:19.970 --> 50:21.050]  It's gonna become a mother plant.
[50:21.050 --> 50:22.810]  It's gonna get cloned out a bunch of times.
[50:22.810 --> 50:25.130]  And then 90% of what I grow is not consumed.
[50:25.130 --> 50:26.450]  It's turned into seeds,
[50:26.450 --> 50:28.210]  so people aren't smoking most of it.
[50:28.850 --> 50:31.370]  That's a different argument right there.
[50:31.370 --> 50:32.810]  Know those laws and rules.
[50:32.810 --> 50:34.530]  I've got the word quarantine written down
[50:34.530 --> 50:36.090]  because that was something I already touched on,
[50:36.090 --> 50:38.010]  but I wanted to segue into it now.
[50:38.010 --> 50:39.850]  When you do get new clones, new plants,
[50:39.850 --> 50:42.650]  make sure you treat them so that they can be quarantined.
[50:42.650 --> 50:44.290]  Don't put them into general population.
[50:44.290 --> 50:45.450]  Keep them safe.
[50:45.450 --> 50:46.710]  All right, let me review my notes.
[50:46.710 --> 50:48.430]  Make sure we've covered everything.
[50:48.430 --> 50:49.770]  I talked about ways to make sure
[50:49.770 --> 50:51.290]  you don't get bugs into the room.
[50:51.290 --> 50:52.890]  I talked about preventative sprays.
[50:52.890 --> 50:55.410]  I've talked about preventative predatory bugs.
[50:55.410 --> 50:57.530]  I've talked about ways to eradicate those bugs
[50:57.530 --> 50:58.370]  if you do see them.
[50:58.370 --> 51:00.330]  If you do see bugs in your grow,
[51:00.330 --> 51:03.290]  it's time to step up your pest application.
[51:03.290 --> 51:04.810]  Keep in mind rotation,
[51:04.810 --> 51:07.530]  and keep in mind bugs do build resistance.
[51:07.530 --> 51:10.970]  Also, multiple modes of attack.
[51:10.970 --> 51:14.330]  Understand how each pesticide works.
[51:14.330 --> 51:17.170]  Some pesticides make the bugs forget to eat.
[51:17.170 --> 51:18.810]  Some make them forget to breathe.
[51:18.810 --> 51:21.810]  Some pesticides grow a mushroom inside of the bug,
[51:21.810 --> 51:24.490]  and the mushroom takes over the bug and they explode.
[51:24.490 --> 51:26.090]  Understand the method of attack.
[51:26.090 --> 51:29.690]  If you can get two modes of attack in a mixture,
[51:29.690 --> 51:31.970]  there's nothing wrong with spraying two pesticides
[51:31.970 --> 51:34.450]  at the same time on your plants
[51:34.450 --> 51:38.530]  if you understand what's in both of those bottles.
[51:38.530 --> 51:40.010]  Some things you can't spray together.
[51:40.010 --> 51:42.250]  Some things will have negative reactions,
[51:42.250 --> 51:44.410]  but most of the time you can mix one, two,
[51:44.410 --> 51:46.570]  maybe even three pesticides together
[51:46.570 --> 51:48.450]  and blast the shit out of that crop.
[51:48.450 --> 51:50.130]  Maybe do a tester spray.
[51:50.130 --> 51:54.210]  Don't hit the whole crop at first, but you can mix things.
[51:54.210 --> 51:55.490]  All right, I think that does wrap up
[51:55.930 --> 51:57.650]  my integrated pest management episode.
[51:57.650 --> 51:59.810]  You guys have been asking for longer episodes.
[51:59.810 --> 52:00.650]  There you go.
[52:00.650 --> 52:02.730]  I'm actually tired from recording a podcast.
[52:02.730 --> 52:04.370]  I wore myself out doing this.
[52:04.370 --> 52:05.570]  Thank you so much for listening.
[52:05.570 --> 52:06.730]  I hope you learned a lot.
[52:06.730 --> 52:08.290]  If you have any questions, corrections,
[52:08.290 --> 52:09.130]  comments, or concerns,
[52:09.130 --> 52:10.770]  you know that I would love to hear from you.
[52:10.770 --> 52:14.370]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[52:14.370 --> 52:15.250]  Don't be shy.
[52:15.250 --> 52:17.090]  Send me those questions, corrections, comments,
[52:17.090 --> 52:19.890]  concerns, constructive criticism, positive feedback.
[52:19.890 --> 52:20.890]  Let me know what you think of the show.
[52:20.890 --> 52:22.170]  I would love to hear from you.
[52:22.170 --> 52:24.530]  Also, if you feel like the show is educational,
[52:24.570 --> 52:25.970]  informative, or entertaining,
[52:25.970 --> 52:27.250]  maybe you'd just like to throw me a buck
[52:27.250 --> 52:28.250]  for helping you out,
[52:28.250 --> 52:30.770]  all you have to do is visit patreon.com
[52:30.770 --> 52:32.610]  forward slash growfromyourheart.
[52:32.610 --> 52:34.530]  All of the information you need to support the show
[52:34.530 --> 52:36.010]  will be right there on the screen.
[52:36.010 --> 52:38.490]  Once again, big thank you to everybody
[52:38.490 --> 52:39.970]  for supporting the show.
[52:39.970 --> 52:42.530]  Any other info you may need will be on my website
[52:42.530 --> 52:44.530]  at iregenetics.com.
[52:44.530 --> 52:46.410]  Don't forget about IRE Direct.
[52:46.410 --> 52:49.370]  There will be a 4th of July sale on IRE Direct.
[52:49.370 --> 52:52.450]  If you have not found it yet, go to my website,
[52:52.450 --> 52:55.810]  iregenetics.com, there's a tab for IRE Direct.
[52:55.810 --> 52:56.850]  Click on there.
[52:56.850 --> 52:59.010]  Don't be discouraged if stock is low.
[52:59.010 --> 53:00.930]  I randomly update that
[53:00.930 --> 53:03.690]  whenever I've got some seeds available to put on there.
[53:03.690 --> 53:04.810]  It could be three in the morning,
[53:04.810 --> 53:06.490]  it could be two in the afternoon.
[53:06.490 --> 53:09.530]  You never know, seeds may pop up on IRE Direct.
[53:09.530 --> 53:11.530]  Stay tuned, refresh often.
[53:11.530 --> 53:12.370]  Here's a hint.
[53:12.370 --> 53:15.550]  If you are a part of the discord, the IRE Army discord,
[53:15.550 --> 53:18.410]  if you go to any tab on the IRE Army discord,
[53:18.410 --> 53:20.330]  the general chat, any of the chat boxes,
[53:20.330 --> 53:23.210]  and you type in $IRE Direct,
[53:23.210 --> 53:25.370]  it will respond with a real-time update
[53:25.370 --> 53:27.210]  of what is in stock on the website.
[53:27.210 --> 53:28.130]  It will give you a list.
[53:28.130 --> 53:30.570]  It'll say the machine is in stock,
[53:30.570 --> 53:32.430]  Strawberry Starburst in stock,
[53:32.430 --> 53:34.210]  the red pill, the blue pill in stock.
[53:34.210 --> 53:36.710]  It'll tell you what is there in real time.
[53:36.710 --> 53:38.010]  They do sell out quite quickly,
[53:38.010 --> 53:39.370]  so once you've got that notification,
[53:39.370 --> 53:41.010]  you gotta get over there and buy the bad motherfuckers.
[53:41.010 --> 53:44.530]  But that is one way to cheat and get an update on stocks.
[53:44.530 --> 53:45.850]  You don't have to click on every one of them
[53:45.850 --> 53:47.210]  and see if it's sold out or not.
[53:47.210 --> 53:49.530]  I apologize that the website does that.
[53:49.530 --> 53:52.530]  Also, there are a lot of kinks to building a new website.
[53:52.530 --> 53:54.650]  Thank you for being patient with me while we get
[53:54.650 --> 53:56.290]  IRE Direct ironed out.
[53:56.290 --> 53:57.170]  I appreciate it.
[53:57.170 --> 53:59.650]  Also, big up to the web guy.
[53:59.650 --> 54:00.910]  You guys, I'm rambling.
[54:00.910 --> 54:02.610]  Let's get the hell out of here.
[54:02.610 --> 54:04.570]  Website, iregenetics.com.
[54:04.570 --> 54:05.650]  Check out IRE Direct.
[54:05.650 --> 54:07.210]  There's a 4th of July coming.
[54:07.210 --> 54:08.610]  New shit will be on there.
[54:08.610 --> 54:10.290]  More of the older shit will be on there.
[54:10.290 --> 54:13.090]  Most importantly, coupon codes and fat sales.
[54:13.090 --> 54:13.930]  Stay tuned.
[54:13.930 --> 54:16.290]  That shit's coming up real, real quick here.
[54:16.290 --> 54:18.230]  You guys, that is all I've got for this episode.
[54:18.230 --> 54:20.670]  I'm tired, my eyes are heavy, my throat's burning out.
[54:20.670 --> 54:22.410]  Give you a lot of great content.
[54:22.410 --> 54:24.130]  That is all I've got for you for this episode.
[54:24.130 --> 54:25.410]  You know I'll be back in a couple of days
[54:25.410 --> 54:26.830]  with fresh new content.
[54:26.830 --> 54:28.950]  I wanna give a big shout out to my friend Lauren
[54:28.950 --> 54:30.510]  at LBC Company.
[54:30.510 --> 54:32.710]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[54:32.710 --> 54:34.270]  and give your mom a hug for me.
