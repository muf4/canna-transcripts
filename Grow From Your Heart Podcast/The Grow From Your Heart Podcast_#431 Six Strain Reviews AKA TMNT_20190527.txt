[00:00.000 --> 00:05.660]  Hey what's up everybody, it is time for episode 431 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:05.660 --> 00:09.740]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:09.740 --> 00:14.060]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[00:14.060 --> 00:19.700]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:19.700 --> 00:23.740]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[00:23.740 --> 00:28.180]  I think you can still hear my last dab in my voice, it was highly effective and it was
[00:28.180 --> 00:29.180]  delicious.
[00:29.180 --> 00:33.860]  I just took a dab of Miracle Alien Cookies, full spectrum extract from our friends at
[00:33.860 --> 00:36.500]  Green Dot Labs, yes that is the MAC.
[00:36.500 --> 00:40.980]  This concentrate is delicious and it got me high as shit.
[00:40.980 --> 00:45.620]  On the package, it says this is a blend of alien cookies and Colombian starfighter.
[00:45.620 --> 00:48.940]  The flavor is described as jelly biscuits and lavender.
[00:48.940 --> 00:53.920]  I don't know that I tasted jelly biscuits but I absolutely did taste and smell the lavender
[00:53.920 --> 00:55.860]  on the exhale.
[00:55.860 --> 01:01.620]  On the back of the package, it says that this product contains 73.88% THC.
[01:01.620 --> 01:06.940]  I've honestly been smoking another concentrate that says it contains 98% total cannabinoids
[01:06.940 --> 01:12.980]  and this Miracle Alien Cookies full spectrum extract immediately put me in another place.
[01:12.980 --> 01:17.500]  It took me somewhere beyond where that 98% concentrate has been putting me.
[01:17.500 --> 01:21.100]  So don't fall for the hype, don't rely too much on the numbers.
[01:21.100 --> 01:25.040]  Lab testing is great but it should not be the main deciding factor when it comes to
[01:25.220 --> 01:26.460]  choosing your medicine.
[01:26.460 --> 01:31.320]  I've got one concentrate in my hand that says it contains 98% total cannabinoids and then
[01:31.320 --> 01:37.120]  I've also got this Miracle Alien Cookies which says it has 73.8% total cannabinoids.
[01:37.120 --> 01:45.120]  I would rather dab this 73.8% concentrate over this 98% concentrate almost any time.
[01:45.120 --> 01:49.420]  I think it tastes better and I think the buzz is more desirable.
[01:49.420 --> 01:53.720]  So that tells me that it's not all about the THC, that it is a lot to do with the other
[01:53.760 --> 01:58.000]  compounds that are in there, the terpenes, the flavonoids, whatever else is in this product.
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.860]  That other, let's see, we've got 74% approximately.
[02:00.860 --> 02:06.160]  That other 26% of stuff is actually making me enjoy the buzz a little bit better.
[02:06.160 --> 02:11.160]  So big shout out once again to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious and tremendous
[02:11.160 --> 02:14.440]  Miracle Alien Cookies full spectrum extract.
[02:14.440 --> 02:17.480]  This shit has me high as giraffe pussy.
[02:17.480 --> 02:20.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers, in this episode I am going to
[02:20.840 --> 02:23.880]  read a couple of emails from some listeners.
[02:23.880 --> 02:28.540]  Those emails will segue us into doing a couple of strain descriptions.
[02:28.540 --> 02:33.040]  Before we get there, let's do a couple of shout outs to our friends on Patreon.
[02:33.040 --> 02:36.680]  I want to give a giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to my friend Farmer John.
[02:36.680 --> 02:41.000]  How about a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to David OQ.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.480]  I always want to send a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast fist bump to my buddy Aldridge.
[02:45.480 --> 02:50.040]  And last but certainly not least, a big Giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out and
[02:50.040 --> 02:52.720]  a fist bump to my buddy Sam.
[02:52.720 --> 02:57.240]  If you would like to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to patreon.com
[02:57.240 --> 02:59.160]  slash growfromyourheart.
[02:59.160 --> 03:02.520]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[03:02.520 --> 03:05.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the show, I said that I had a couple of
[03:05.160 --> 03:06.160]  emails.
[03:06.160 --> 03:07.760]  Let's not waste any more time.
[03:07.760 --> 03:09.480]  Let's jump right into this first email.
[03:09.480 --> 03:10.720]  Let's see if I can say their name.
[03:10.720 --> 03:14.520]  Right on the message, it says no names on the podcast if you read this.
[03:14.520 --> 03:16.620]  So I know not to say your name.
[03:16.620 --> 03:17.620]  Let's get right into it.
[03:17.620 --> 03:18.760]  It goes a lot like this.
[03:18.760 --> 03:22.760]  Hey Jeff, I've been listening for over a year and I have bought seeds.
[03:22.760 --> 03:24.760]  Hey, thank you for buying seeds.
[03:24.760 --> 03:27.760]  Not only am I a podcaster, I am also a seed breeder.
[03:27.760 --> 03:28.960]  Some people may not know that.
[03:28.960 --> 03:33.560]  I am the only breeder, the only proprietor of Iry Genetics Colorado.
[03:33.560 --> 03:34.560]  That is all me.
[03:34.560 --> 03:36.720]  And this person has bought seeds.
[03:36.720 --> 03:37.720]  Thank you.
[03:37.720 --> 03:38.720]  I appreciate that.
[03:38.720 --> 03:41.320]  Those seeds are available at dankseed.store.
[03:41.320 --> 03:43.160]  That is the hella dank seed company.
[03:43.160 --> 03:46.440]  My seeds are also available at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[03:46.440 --> 03:49.320]  You can also find my seeds at Green Go Beans.
[03:49.320 --> 03:53.800]  In the very near future, I will be announcing another vendor that I am very proud to be
[03:53.800 --> 03:55.160]  involved with.
[03:55.160 --> 03:56.160]  Let's keep moving.
[03:56.160 --> 03:57.160]  This email continues.
[03:57.160 --> 04:01.960]  It says, I think you would sell even more seeds if you made more strain info available.
[04:01.960 --> 04:07.420]  I shop heavily with Duke Diamond, mainly because he has those growing tips on the package.
[04:07.420 --> 04:11.800]  And on Seeds Here Now Listings, he has great descriptions and grow notes and tips.
[04:11.800 --> 04:14.840]  Hey, I love the constructive criticism.
[04:14.840 --> 04:16.960]  I don't have a lot of details on my packaging.
[04:16.960 --> 04:19.000]  My packaging is very minimalistic.
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.280]  I kind of have one generic package, then I put a sticker on it to identify the strains.
[04:23.280 --> 04:26.120]  So my packaging, yes, does not contain a lot of info.
[04:26.120 --> 04:32.480]  However, my website has overly detailed descriptions of every strain that I have available, plus
[04:32.480 --> 04:36.400]  stuff that I released a long time ago and has since been discontinued.
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.520]  So on my website, you should be able to find information on every strain available.
[04:40.520 --> 04:44.080]  And I put a lot of the older strains that are discontinued up there also because they
[04:44.080 --> 04:46.640]  were used as parents in current crosses.
[04:46.640 --> 04:49.600]  So if you see something like, what's one that I did a lot of work on?
[04:49.600 --> 04:53.380]  If you see something like Space Force, you say, well, what the heck is Space Force?
[04:53.380 --> 04:56.040]  Space Force is Space Bitch crossed to Arise.
[04:56.040 --> 04:58.360]  People may not know what Arise or Space Bitch is.
[04:58.360 --> 05:02.640]  So you can click on Space Bitch and you can see that Space Bitch is a space queen from
[05:02.640 --> 05:07.040]  Subcool pollinated by my reversed grateful dog that made Space Bitch.
[05:07.040 --> 05:10.400]  Then you can also see that Arise is Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[05:10.400 --> 05:13.000]  And then you can start breaking down the family tree that way.
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.160]  Because a lot of people who are buying seeds really want to know really detailed lineage
[05:17.160 --> 05:18.240]  of what they're buying.
[05:18.240 --> 05:23.960]  So on my website, I do have overly detailed descriptions, but I do appreciate your recommendation.
[05:23.960 --> 05:28.900]  And in the future, maybe I will be able to add more descriptions to my packaging.
[05:28.900 --> 05:32.660]  The message goes on and it says, I bought your Lemon Jeffrey after listening to that
[05:32.660 --> 05:36.720]  strain review episode because it is cool to hear the breeder give tips and a little of
[05:36.720 --> 05:37.720]  what to expect.
[05:37.720 --> 05:39.040]  Well, that means a lot to me.
[05:39.040 --> 05:42.600]  I'm glad that you appreciated and trusted my review.
[05:42.920 --> 05:46.360]  And I'm glad you got some seeds by being inspired off of that episode.
[05:46.360 --> 05:47.360]  So that helps out.
[05:47.360 --> 05:48.520]  Man, I hope they went crazy.
[05:48.520 --> 05:49.840]  I hope you grew the shit out of those.
[05:49.840 --> 05:51.960]  I hope they made you completely happy.
[05:51.960 --> 05:52.960]  Let's continue with the message.
[05:52.960 --> 05:57.420]  It says, I understand that you don't like to toot your own horn on the show by doing
[05:57.420 --> 05:59.520]  strain reviews for every offering.
[05:59.520 --> 06:02.880]  And who knows, maybe I would get sick of a month of strain reviews.
[06:02.880 --> 06:08.320]  But how about an episode or two where you give a shorter presentation on each strain?
[06:08.320 --> 06:13.080]  Perhaps a quick story, a few phenos to look for, a tip or two, and then take a dab of
[06:13.080 --> 06:14.400]  it and describe it to us.
[06:14.400 --> 06:16.360]  Hey, that is a wonderful idea.
[06:16.360 --> 06:17.360]  And you're right.
[06:17.360 --> 06:20.640]  It does feel a little bit weird sitting here and talking about my favorite strains, the
[06:20.640 --> 06:23.560]  strains that I've created, the strains that I've made available.
[06:23.560 --> 06:25.880]  It feels egotistical and it feels kind of weird doing it.
[06:25.880 --> 06:30.160]  But so many people ask for it that I do feel like it is time to put out a few more strain
[06:30.160 --> 06:31.160]  episodes.
[06:31.160 --> 06:32.160]  So look forward to those.
[06:32.160 --> 06:35.560]  In fact, in this episode, we are going to jump into some strain descriptions pretty
[06:35.560 --> 06:36.680]  soon here.
[06:36.680 --> 06:38.340]  There's more to this email and it goes like this.
[06:38.340 --> 06:42.560]  You hit a bunch of strains, dished out a ton of info on the Dude Grow Show, and that was
[06:42.560 --> 06:44.800]  with Scotty taking up time too.
[06:44.800 --> 06:48.840]  I think a couple of episodes would be enough to really push your seed sales through the
[06:48.840 --> 06:52.840]  roof and help all those customers get what they are really looking for.
[06:52.840 --> 06:53.840]  Hey, thank you, man.
[06:53.840 --> 06:54.840]  I appreciate that.
[06:54.840 --> 06:58.300]  It is great to hear advice and guidance from consumers.
[06:58.300 --> 07:00.080]  I am on this end of the business.
[07:00.080 --> 07:01.080]  You're on that end.
[07:01.080 --> 07:02.180]  I need to know what you're thinking.
[07:02.180 --> 07:04.340]  So I do appreciate this sort of feedback.
[07:04.340 --> 07:05.340]  Thank you.
[07:05.340 --> 07:07.800]  And then he took the email and it says, you are the man.
[07:07.800 --> 07:10.660]  Thanks again for all of the info and the entertainment.
[07:10.660 --> 07:13.260]  And then he ends it by signing his name and he asked me not to say that.
[07:13.260 --> 07:14.660]  So I'm going to keep your name private.
[07:14.660 --> 07:16.160]  Hey, thank you for the great message.
[07:16.160 --> 07:19.860]  Thank you for the encouragement and thank you for the constructive criticism.
[07:19.860 --> 07:21.280]  I do appreciate that.
[07:21.280 --> 07:25.060]  People don't know where they can improve, where they're making mistakes until sometimes
[07:25.060 --> 07:26.660]  somebody points that out to them.
[07:26.660 --> 07:27.660]  So thank you.
[07:27.660 --> 07:31.860]  I know now that by doing a little better strain descriptions on my packaging and having a
[07:31.860 --> 07:35.960]  little bit better of a strain description on the vendor websites that maybe I may sell
[07:35.960 --> 07:40.780]  a few more seed packages, which would always be nice for myself as a seed seller and always
[07:40.780 --> 07:44.340]  nice for the people on the other end who are getting seeds that they need.
[07:44.340 --> 07:45.820]  So thank you for the great advice.
[07:45.820 --> 07:47.180]  I will take that to heart.
[07:47.180 --> 07:51.460]  In fact, we are going to use some of your advice on this episode.
[07:51.460 --> 07:55.380]  Let's get right into the next email because it goes a lot like this.
[07:55.380 --> 07:59.020]  Hey, I'm in prohibition land, so please don't say my name.
[07:59.020 --> 08:03.860]  I just wanted to say that your podcast has helped me immensely in my growing efforts.
[08:03.860 --> 08:09.420]  I work nine hours a day as a janitor, basically sweeping floors and being bored all day, and
[08:09.420 --> 08:12.500]  your podcast helps so much to pass the time.
[08:12.500 --> 08:14.820]  Hey man, I'm glad I'm making your day go by.
[08:14.820 --> 08:17.340]  That has got to get tedious, just sweeping floors.
[08:17.340 --> 08:20.340]  I'm glad I'm there to entertain you at least one or two days a week.
[08:20.340 --> 08:21.340]  Thanks for listening.
[08:21.340 --> 08:23.660]  It feels like we've got a great relationship already.
[08:23.660 --> 08:27.700]  He goes on to say, I love the show lessons or I love the grow lessons, and I also love
[08:27.700 --> 08:29.260]  the episodes with White Mike.
[08:29.260 --> 08:31.060]  Hey White Mike, you got a shout out bro.
[08:31.060 --> 08:33.060]  It's time to come do another episode.
[08:33.060 --> 08:38.060]  He goes on to say, I just finished my first grow and I was honestly feeling a little discouraged
[08:38.060 --> 08:42.740]  and I had thoughts of giving up growing because I did not get the yield I had wanted.
[08:42.740 --> 08:47.340]  But then I heard you talk on one of the grow lessons about how to not be discouraged by
[08:47.340 --> 08:52.400]  your first grow and to instead use it as a learning opportunity, and that advice has
[08:52.400 --> 08:54.140]  stuck with me.
[08:54.140 --> 08:57.660]  Yes, you can't give up on the first try of anything.
[08:57.660 --> 08:59.900]  Remember the first time you played Mario Kart?
[08:59.900 --> 09:00.900]  You sucked.
[09:00.900 --> 09:01.900]  It was embarrassing.
[09:01.900 --> 09:02.900]  It was no fun.
[09:02.900 --> 09:04.700]  You couldn't keep that damn car on the track.
[09:04.700 --> 09:06.060]  You couldn't go around the corners right.
[09:06.060 --> 09:08.300]  Somebody threw a banana at you and you fucking spun out.
[09:08.300 --> 09:09.300]  You were angry.
[09:09.300 --> 09:12.380]  But now, everybody kicks ass at Mario Kart.
[09:12.380 --> 09:15.900]  So you can't expect to be really good at anything the first time you try it.
[09:15.900 --> 09:18.960]  I was a terrible drummer the first time I got sticks.
[09:18.960 --> 09:21.420]  People wanted to beat me to death with my drumsticks.
[09:21.420 --> 09:24.420]  Now I can hold a fat groove all day long.
[09:24.420 --> 09:28.820]  Don't feel discouraged if you are not a pro at something the very first time.
[09:28.820 --> 09:31.980]  Don't expect to be a pro at growing the very first time.
[09:31.980 --> 09:37.140]  If you have a successful crop that you can smoke out of your first grow, that is success.
[09:37.140 --> 09:40.300]  And like this guy says, use it as a learning experience.
[09:40.300 --> 09:42.900]  Now you've got a baseline to start from.
[09:42.900 --> 09:45.780]  If your next grow is worse, you should reconsider shit.
[09:45.780 --> 09:49.040]  If your next grow is better, you are on the path you need to be on.
[09:49.040 --> 09:53.100]  So don't ever get discouraged from anything you fail at the first time.
[09:53.100 --> 09:54.100]  That is a learning lesson.
[09:54.780 --> 09:57.820]  You don't need to fail the first time because if you're successful, if you're hugely successful
[09:57.820 --> 10:02.940]  at anything the first time, it gets to your ego and you start teaching yourself bad habits
[10:02.940 --> 10:04.260]  because you already know everything.
[10:04.260 --> 10:05.700]  So you've got to fuck up.
[10:05.700 --> 10:06.700]  You've got to be humbled.
[10:06.700 --> 10:08.460]  Then you can improve.
[10:08.460 --> 10:10.020]  So let's continue with this email.
[10:10.020 --> 10:15.100]  It says, I am now on my second grow and I'm growing Michelangelo from Iry Genetics in
[10:15.100 --> 10:18.900]  a five-gallon pot with Fox Farms Ocean Forest soil.
[10:18.900 --> 10:25.540]  And I'm using a Horticultural Lighting Group 100 grow light with a two-by-two grow tent.
[10:25.540 --> 10:29.740]  He says, I live in a one-room cabin without much space, but I am feeling more confident
[10:29.740 --> 10:33.580]  about this grow thanks to the help of your podcast.
[10:33.580 --> 10:37.980]  He goes on to say, if you have any tips for that strain, it would be awesome to hear them.
[10:37.980 --> 10:42.000]  I'm sorry for the rambling email, but I wanted to let you know that your show is amazing
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.460]  and tell you to keep up the good work, man.
[10:45.460 --> 10:47.300]  Dude, this is a great email.
[10:47.300 --> 10:48.300]  Thank you.
[10:48.300 --> 10:53.020]  So this guy started off disappointed in his first grow, but listening to the podcast encouraged
[10:53.020 --> 10:54.460]  him to give it a second try.
[10:54.460 --> 10:58.780]  So I'm proud of you for going in for a second try, even though the first time kind of disappointed
[10:58.780 --> 10:59.780]  you.
[10:59.780 --> 11:01.380]  This time he has got a great setup.
[11:01.380 --> 11:03.460]  He's got some Michelangelo seeds.
[11:03.460 --> 11:07.780]  That is a platinum tangy pollinated by a reversed blueberry cookies.
[11:07.780 --> 11:10.420]  So he's got some feminized seeds that are very reliable.
[11:10.420 --> 11:11.800]  I know what they are going to do.
[11:11.800 --> 11:13.980]  These are going to be great in that grow.
[11:13.980 --> 11:18.340]  He's got a five gallon fabric pot with Fox Farms Ocean Forest soil.
[11:18.340 --> 11:20.140]  That is going to be great for this grow.
[11:20.140 --> 11:21.620]  He's using the appropriate light.
[11:21.620 --> 11:24.620]  He's got an HLG 100 and his two by two tent.
[11:24.620 --> 11:25.780]  So that is going to be perfect.
[11:25.780 --> 11:30.200]  He's probably got one five gallon pot under this light in a two by two tent.
[11:30.200 --> 11:33.180]  This should provide perfect medicine for one person.
[11:33.180 --> 11:38.300]  Now he says, if you have any tips for the Michelangelo, it would be awesome to hear
[11:38.300 --> 11:39.300]  them.
[11:39.300 --> 11:43.740]  Now this is the point in the episode where that first email talking about strain descriptions
[11:43.780 --> 11:48.420]  and strain review episodes is going to collide with this email where our new friend is asking
[11:48.420 --> 11:51.820]  for advice and guidance on the strain Michelangelo.
[11:51.820 --> 11:56.260]  Now let's shift podcast gears and do a few strain reviews.
[11:56.260 --> 11:58.340]  I'm not going to start with the Michelangelo.
[11:58.340 --> 12:01.620]  Today I want to start with the strain that I call Leonardo.
[12:01.620 --> 12:04.180]  Leonardo is a very important strain to me.
[12:04.180 --> 12:09.740]  Leonardo was made from a reversed blueberry cookies plant, which is a platinum cookies
[12:09.740 --> 12:11.340]  crossed to the blueberry Tahoe.
[12:11.820 --> 12:14.740]  So you can already imagine the smells and aromas coming from there.
[12:14.740 --> 12:20.260]  I had the blueberry cookies plant and I reversed it, which means I treated it with a solution.
[12:20.260 --> 12:23.980]  That solution made that plant produce pollen sacks.
[12:23.980 --> 12:29.180]  Those pollen sacks produced pollen that only contain female chromosomes.
[12:29.180 --> 12:31.620]  I have done complete episodes on reversing plants.
[12:31.620 --> 12:34.660]  I have done full episodes on selfed and reversed plants.
[12:34.660 --> 12:39.300]  If you want more information on that, check out episode number 331 called selfing and
[12:39.300 --> 12:40.300]  reversals.
[12:40.300 --> 12:41.740]  I go into deep detail there.
[12:41.740 --> 12:45.500]  Today we're going to focus on these few strains because I can tell that this episode is going
[12:45.500 --> 12:47.100]  to get quite long.
[12:47.100 --> 12:49.460]  So I took the blueberry cookies and I selfed it.
[12:49.460 --> 12:52.060]  So that is a blueberry cookies S1.
[12:52.060 --> 12:53.300]  That is the Leonardo.
[12:53.300 --> 12:56.020]  Let's talk briefly about Leonardo.
[12:56.020 --> 12:59.000]  Leonardo is the blueberry cookies S1 being selfed.
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.860]  That means it doesn't have a lot of opportunity for phenotypical variation.
[13:02.860 --> 13:06.100]  You're going to find very common phenotypes in there.
[13:06.100 --> 13:09.260]  Blueberry cookies will grow tall and fast in veg.
[13:09.260 --> 13:13.540]  Coming from the Tahoe OG parents and the Girl Scout cookies parents, she likes to get kind
[13:13.540 --> 13:14.540]  of tall.
[13:14.540 --> 13:16.420]  She will make long branches.
[13:16.420 --> 13:19.420]  She also makes giant colas.
[13:19.420 --> 13:23.300]  Most of the crosses that came from the blueberry cookies really take off in height, but they
[13:23.300 --> 13:26.780]  make up for it because they make gigantic top colas.
[13:26.780 --> 13:30.740]  So be prepared for taller plants, maybe flower just a little bit early.
[13:30.740 --> 13:35.380]  Expect your plants to double in size from the time you flip them to the end of flower.
[13:35.380 --> 13:40.380]  So the blueberry cookies will get tall and it makes tall offspring, but they make gigantic
[13:40.380 --> 13:42.340]  buds so it is worth it.
[13:42.340 --> 13:47.380]  You will get heavy harvests from almost all of the blueberry cookies crosses.
[13:47.380 --> 13:50.660]  Almost every phenotype will give you big fat harvests.
[13:50.660 --> 13:54.300]  So Leonardo is going to get kind of tall and make gigantic buds.
[13:54.300 --> 13:58.600]  I like to give Leo about eight and a half to 10 weeks to finish.
[13:58.600 --> 13:59.940]  It depends on your environment.
[13:59.940 --> 14:00.940]  It depends on your room.
[14:00.940 --> 14:02.460]  It depends on your feeding.
[14:02.580 --> 14:06.260]  Somewhere between eight and a half to 10 weeks will be perfect for this plant.
[14:06.260 --> 14:08.980]  Somewhere between 60 and 70 days.
[14:08.980 --> 14:14.420]  Everything that comes from the Leonardo crosses can be fed very heavily and they also like
[14:14.420 --> 14:15.860]  to drink a lot.
[14:15.860 --> 14:20.120]  I've noticed that most of them love to suck up more water than the average plant.
[14:20.120 --> 14:23.900]  So don't be afraid to feed them heavily and you're going to have to water them frequently.
[14:23.900 --> 14:25.520]  So be on top of that.
[14:25.520 --> 14:29.940]  Now all of the crosses that come from the Leonardo, the reversed blueberry cookies, they
[14:29.940 --> 14:31.600]  are all huge producers.
[14:31.600 --> 14:33.080]  They make gigantic buds.
[14:33.080 --> 14:35.240]  They all make tremendous resin production.
[14:35.240 --> 14:36.680]  They are all super potent.
[14:36.680 --> 14:40.400]  They're all going to take somewhere between eight and a half to 10 weeks to finish.
[14:40.400 --> 14:45.300]  The thing that is really going to make these crosses stand out is all of the unique flavors
[14:45.300 --> 14:46.300]  and aromas.
[14:46.300 --> 14:51.780]  I used very carefully selected females for these crosses and my goal was to make ridiculous
[14:51.780 --> 14:54.680]  candy turps and I feel like I nailed that goal.
[14:54.680 --> 14:58.240]  So let's talk about the flavors and aromas from the blueberry cookies.
[14:58.240 --> 15:02.400]  The dominant smell of course is the blueberry, but it also has a funk to it.
[15:02.400 --> 15:07.560]  It is almost like blue nerds or some sort of blue candy, maybe blue Skittles.
[15:07.560 --> 15:12.040]  It kind of reminds me of when I was younger and I used to buy those blue raspberry lollipops
[15:12.040 --> 15:14.780]  and I would suck on those and it would turn my whole face blue.
[15:14.780 --> 15:18.560]  It kind of reminds me of those kind of suckers with a wang to it.
[15:18.560 --> 15:21.140]  It's got something sharper, something funky to it.
[15:21.140 --> 15:25.100]  It's like blue nerds and Skittles with dirty feet in the bag or something.
[15:25.100 --> 15:29.740]  It is really enjoyable and I really love that funky, everybody that smells it really
[15:29.740 --> 15:30.740]  loves that aroma.
[15:30.740 --> 15:33.100]  That is part of what inspired me to work with this.
[15:33.100 --> 15:38.300]  A very well-known grower and breeder smoked some of the finished product and when he smoked
[15:38.300 --> 15:40.440]  it, he said, man, this is amazing.
[15:40.440 --> 15:42.020]  Are there any seeds available?
[15:42.020 --> 15:44.060]  And I said, there aren't any seeds available.
[15:44.060 --> 15:47.780]  And he said, can somebody reverse this and make some seeds so that I can take this back
[15:47.780 --> 15:49.840]  to where I live and grow it there?
[15:49.840 --> 15:54.260]  And everybody kind of looked at me and it became my job to reverse the blueberry cookies
[15:54.300 --> 15:58.660]  and make seeds of it for this friend of ours who was a highly respected member of the cannabis
[15:58.660 --> 15:59.800]  community.
[15:59.800 --> 16:05.080]  I was honored to accept that job, but when I do something like that, I don't just make
[16:05.080 --> 16:06.080]  one cross.
[16:06.080 --> 16:10.300]  I had to think about it and I chose a few of my favorite females to put in the room
[16:10.300 --> 16:13.560]  along with the blueberry cookies to pollinate them also.
[16:13.560 --> 16:17.500]  And I feel like I made very wise choices on the girls that I selected, but let's keep
[16:17.500 --> 16:19.700]  focusing on the blueberry cookies for a moment.
[16:19.700 --> 16:21.820]  We're still talking about the flavors here.
[16:21.820 --> 16:22.820]  It is unique.
[16:22.820 --> 16:23.820]  It is crazy.
[16:24.380 --> 16:27.700]  It is like blue raspberries and it is like blue Skittles and the flavor just hangs out
[16:27.700 --> 16:28.940]  in your mouth for a long time.
[16:28.940 --> 16:30.180]  You'll have tremendous cotton mouth.
[16:30.180 --> 16:33.420]  You'd be like, I really need a drink, but you won't want to drink anything because that
[16:33.420 --> 16:37.260]  cotton mouth flavor from the blueberry cookies is just so delicious.
[16:37.260 --> 16:42.500]  So a lot of the crosses are going to be dominated by that blueberry cookies, blue raspberry
[16:42.500 --> 16:43.600]  funky terp.
[16:43.600 --> 16:47.460]  So keep that in mind as we talk about all of the next crosses.
[16:47.460 --> 16:50.980]  The next cross I want to talk about that was made from that reversed blueberry cookies
[16:51.100 --> 16:53.780]  is a strain I call Donatello.
[16:53.780 --> 16:58.940]  Donatello was made by the reversed blueberry cookies pollinating my favorite lemon skunk
[16:58.940 --> 16:59.940]  female.
[16:59.940 --> 17:02.100]  I talk about that lemon skunk female a lot.
[17:02.100 --> 17:04.340]  That is the mother of the lemon Jeffrey.
[17:04.340 --> 17:06.460]  She is also the mother of Firefly.
[17:06.460 --> 17:08.980]  That lemon skunk has made a lot of great progeny.
[17:08.980 --> 17:12.300]  I've been working with her for several years because I love that plant.
[17:12.300 --> 17:13.900]  It smells amazing.
[17:13.900 --> 17:14.900]  It is gorgeous.
[17:14.900 --> 17:20.020]  It puts off beautiful colors, beautiful, bright, bright, light green colors with beautiful
[17:20.020 --> 17:21.020]  orange pistols.
[17:21.020 --> 17:22.540]  It is such a gorgeous plant.
[17:22.540 --> 17:26.460]  It smells like lemon candy and sort of a lemon sorbet sort of a thing.
[17:26.460 --> 17:28.400]  I've never smelled anything like it.
[17:28.400 --> 17:32.540]  It came from seed, so I'm the only one that has got that phenotype as far as I've ever
[17:32.540 --> 17:33.540]  seen.
[17:33.540 --> 17:34.540]  I think it's an amazing plant.
[17:34.540 --> 17:36.020]  I love working with that lemon skunk.
[17:36.020 --> 17:40.340]  I love it because of the aromas, the structure, everything about it is beautiful.
[17:40.340 --> 17:45.900]  When I crossed it to the blueberry cookies, it put a lemon lime blueberry sort of a wang
[17:45.900 --> 17:46.900]  to it.
[17:46.900 --> 17:48.040]  It is really amazing.
[17:48.080 --> 17:53.040]  It's sort of like a key lime pie with blueberries in the middle or a blue raspberry key lime
[17:53.040 --> 17:55.040]  kind of a pie sort of a thing going on.
[17:55.040 --> 17:58.320]  I really like the aromas and flavors of that one.
[17:58.320 --> 18:03.560]  Donatello does grow tall because of that lemon skunk, but it's got big, thick, fat branches
[18:03.560 --> 18:05.760]  so it can get tall and it can handle being cracked.
[18:05.760 --> 18:06.760]  It can handle being bent.
[18:06.760 --> 18:08.600]  It can handle being worked into a net.
[18:08.600 --> 18:10.080]  It likes that sort of a stuff.
[18:10.080 --> 18:13.600]  Again, I think it should go about eight to 10 weeks for best results.
[18:13.600 --> 18:17.920]  It is going to vary depending on your environment, based on your humidity, your temperature,
[18:17.920 --> 18:18.920]  your nutrients.
[18:18.920 --> 18:22.520]  A lot of things will determine the factor of how long it takes for these plants to finish
[18:22.520 --> 18:27.440]  in your room, but somewhere between 60 and 70 days should be perfect.
[18:27.440 --> 18:31.040]  One thing I should note about the Donatello, most of these strains I'm talking about get
[18:31.040 --> 18:32.040]  quite tall.
[18:32.040 --> 18:34.360]  Donatello is one of the more branchy strains.
[18:34.360 --> 18:35.360]  It will widen out.
[18:35.360 --> 18:38.680]  It wants a little bit more space than the rest of its sisters in this line.
[18:38.680 --> 18:43.800]  It wants to spread its arms just a little bit more and it does get a little bit branchier.
[18:43.800 --> 18:47.960]  You may need to be prepared with stakes, tomato cages, or some sort of scrog net because
[18:47.960 --> 18:49.760]  she may need some training.
[18:49.760 --> 18:51.320]  She's going to try to widen out on you.
[18:51.320 --> 18:55.000]  Also, she will need some supports later in flower because those long branches will need
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.000]  some support.
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.640]  Again, all of these strains love it when you put them in a scrog.
[18:59.640 --> 19:02.200]  They love it when you crack them, when you super crop them, when you twist them, when
[19:02.200 --> 19:03.200]  you pop them.
[19:03.200 --> 19:04.200]  They like being topped.
[19:04.200 --> 19:08.400]  All of these plants can take pretty good abuse because of the parents I selected.
[19:08.400 --> 19:11.080]  Now let's talk about the strain that inspired this episode.
[19:11.080 --> 19:12.920]  Let's talk about Michelangelo.
[19:13.040 --> 19:17.560]  Michelangelo is made from a platinum tangy female that was of course pollinated by that
[19:17.560 --> 19:19.400]  blueberry cookies male.
[19:19.400 --> 19:22.640]  The platinum tangy has its own crazy unique aromas.
[19:22.640 --> 19:24.740]  It is like dirty, greasy oranges.
[19:24.740 --> 19:28.880]  It's like candied oranges that you got at the motor oil shop or something like that.
[19:28.880 --> 19:30.120]  It is delicious and funky.
[19:30.120 --> 19:34.120]  I tend to like those really fruity flavors with something nasty on top of it.
[19:34.120 --> 19:36.920]  It just seems to be one of my favorite varieties to find.
[19:36.920 --> 19:40.960]  It's something with a real familiar citrusy fruit thing and then just dirty it up with
[19:40.960 --> 19:41.960]  some funk.
[19:42.000 --> 19:43.000]  I really like that.
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.440]  What I've noticed in most of the Michelangelo seeds is that it is dominantly oranges.
[19:47.440 --> 19:53.120]  It comes out as just sweet, gross oranges, almost orange rinds, almost overpowering orange
[19:53.120 --> 19:54.680]  cleaner.
[19:54.680 --> 20:00.120]  Oranges sometimes have an overpowering astringent aroma when you get too close to the rind.
[20:00.120 --> 20:04.200]  I think sometimes the Michelangelo can carry that in some of the phenotypes.
[20:04.200 --> 20:06.920]  It is overpoweringly orange and it is amazing.
[20:06.920 --> 20:11.340]  If you want to make concentrates that taste like straight up tangerines and oranges, Michelangelo
[20:11.720 --> 20:13.140]  is the way to go for you.
[20:13.140 --> 20:19.180]  Our friend Stabby McStabberson grew some Michelangelo that the jar still smells like oranges and
[20:19.180 --> 20:22.500]  tangerines and it's been empty for over a month now.
[20:22.500 --> 20:26.780]  The flavors for Michelangelo is dominantly oranges with a little bit of that skittly
[20:26.780 --> 20:31.340]  funk on top of it, that candy funk sweetness, which I really enjoy.
[20:31.340 --> 20:33.860]  Michelangelo is another one that will branch out a little bit for you.
[20:33.860 --> 20:36.820]  Coming from that platinum tangy, that one doesn't get super tall.
[20:36.820 --> 20:38.660]  It's kind of a short squat plant.
[20:38.660 --> 20:41.540]  That makes the Michelangelo do kind of the same thing.
[20:41.540 --> 20:43.340]  She stays a little shorter than the rest.
[20:43.340 --> 20:44.940]  Don't get me wrong, she will get tall on you.
[20:44.940 --> 20:47.820]  She'll make big plants, but she is a little branchier.
[20:47.820 --> 20:52.020]  She widens out a little bit more, but she makes really thick stalks so she can support
[20:52.020 --> 20:54.460]  herself a little better than the Donatello.
[20:54.460 --> 20:58.860]  Again, like all of these crosses, Michelangelo will love being scrogged.
[20:58.860 --> 21:00.100]  She'll love being trained.
[21:00.100 --> 21:01.300]  She'll love being topped.
[21:01.300 --> 21:04.460]  These plants can all take quite a bit of abuse.
[21:04.460 --> 21:08.780]  Another thing I should note, Michelangelo may be the earliest finisher out of this bunch.
[21:08.780 --> 21:11.820]  I keep saying that some of them should take 60 to 70 days.
[21:11.820 --> 21:16.040]  Mikey may finish as early as 56 or 55 days.
[21:16.040 --> 21:17.040]  Don't be in a rush.
[21:17.040 --> 21:18.040]  Let it finish.
[21:18.040 --> 21:19.040]  If it wants to go longer, let it.
[21:19.040 --> 21:23.460]  But some of the phenotypes coming from that platinum tangy cross do make it finish a little
[21:23.460 --> 21:24.460]  bit earlier.
[21:24.460 --> 21:26.100]  So that is Michelangelo.
[21:26.100 --> 21:27.820]  Let's talk next about Raphael.
[21:27.820 --> 21:32.100]  I'm sure by now you have found the trend and the theme in these strains that I made.
[21:32.100 --> 21:34.260]  You can see where these names came from.
[21:35.060 --> 21:36.060]  Let's talk about Raphael.
[21:36.060 --> 21:40.940]  Raphael is the strawberry fields from Crockett Farms, pollinated by the reversed blueberry
[21:40.940 --> 21:42.060]  cookies.
[21:42.060 --> 21:44.020]  That strawberry fields plant is great to grow.
[21:44.020 --> 21:45.700]  It makes giant colas.
[21:45.700 --> 21:48.620]  That definitely came through in the cross.
[21:48.620 --> 21:53.420]  Raphael likes to make giant, huge top colas that are just coated in trichomes and they
[21:53.420 --> 21:55.360]  smell ridiculous.
[21:55.360 --> 21:59.400]  It is like strawberries and tangerines and there's a little bit of a grapefruit thing
[21:59.400 --> 22:00.620]  going on in there.
[22:00.620 --> 22:03.180]  Then you get that blueberry Skittles that backs it up.
[22:03.180 --> 22:06.660]  It is really hard to describe because it is just so funky.
[22:06.660 --> 22:11.960]  It's tropical, it's strawberries, it's mangoes, it's pineapples, it's bananas.
[22:11.960 --> 22:16.220]  It's got a little bit of all that tropical fruit plus that weird funk that I like.
[22:16.220 --> 22:17.560]  It is really delicious.
[22:17.560 --> 22:21.180]  It almost tastes like, in my opinion, and people think I'm crazy sometimes with my strain
[22:21.180 --> 22:23.640]  descriptions, but a lot of people love it.
[22:23.640 --> 22:27.160]  A lot of times when I smoke a dab, my mouth gets really dry.
[22:27.160 --> 22:30.700]  I feel like when I smoke the Raphael, my mouth gets juicy.
[22:30.720 --> 22:35.220]  It tastes like I just ate juicy candy or juicy fruit and my mouth is actually moist
[22:35.220 --> 22:36.220]  from it.
[22:36.220 --> 22:39.540]  I'm not thirsty when I smoke the Raphael concentrates.
[22:39.540 --> 22:43.820]  One thing I should add to that is Raphael makes great concentrates and it makes a lot
[22:43.820 --> 22:44.820]  of concentrates.
[22:44.820 --> 22:49.300]  Everybody that presses it, that washes it, that extracts it in any way, they always report
[22:49.300 --> 22:51.620]  back that they got impressive returns.
[22:51.620 --> 22:55.740]  Then later on, they always report that it tasted amazing.
[22:55.740 --> 22:57.300]  Raphael is great for concentrates.
[22:57.300 --> 22:59.220]  It is also great for production.
[22:59.220 --> 23:04.100]  If you need something with fat harvest and good bag appeal and unique aromas, Raphael
[23:04.100 --> 23:05.620]  is perfect for you.
[23:05.620 --> 23:09.180]  I've got two more strains I want to talk about here in this strain review episode.
[23:09.180 --> 23:12.180]  The next one I want to talk about is called Bebop.
[23:12.180 --> 23:19.620]  Bebop is my prized Arise number four female pollinated by the reversed blueberry cookies.
[23:19.620 --> 23:25.060]  Those are two of my best tasting, favorite to grow, favorite to smoke, best lab testing,
[23:25.060 --> 23:26.540]  easiest to work with strains.
[23:26.540 --> 23:30.660]  I crossed them and the results were almost exactly what I expected.
[23:30.660 --> 23:34.420]  I turbocharged the good traits from both of those plants.
[23:34.420 --> 23:40.420]  I basically made bigger, badder blueberry cookies with more potency and more trichomes.
[23:40.420 --> 23:42.820]  It seems to grow with more vigor.
[23:42.820 --> 23:44.980]  Bebop does tend to get a little bit tall.
[23:44.980 --> 23:49.120]  That's because it has got the Joseph OG, the Kim D, the Tahoe, and the cookies all in there
[23:49.120 --> 23:51.460]  that is going to result in taller plants.
[23:51.460 --> 23:55.780]  Also, this is one of the longer finishing crosses in this line.
[23:55.780 --> 23:59.420]  I keep saying that most of these plants are going to take about eight to 10 weeks.
[23:59.420 --> 24:04.460]  I really recommend that you let this one go closer to 10 weeks if you've got the opportunity.
[24:04.460 --> 24:08.300]  That last week, it's going to add potency and it is going to give itself just another
[24:08.300 --> 24:09.540]  week to just bulk up.
[24:09.540 --> 24:13.300]  It'll get even bigger and fatter on you and it'll be well worth that extra week if you
[24:13.300 --> 24:15.980]  can let it go that full 70 days.
[24:15.980 --> 24:17.300]  Bebop does get tall.
[24:17.300 --> 24:21.300]  She does take a little bit longer to finish, but she is ridiculously potent.
[24:21.300 --> 24:24.300]  Arise is one of my highest lab testing strains.
[24:24.300 --> 24:27.660]  The blueberry cookies always test really high in the lab when we grow it in a commercial
[24:27.660 --> 24:28.660]  facility.
[24:28.660 --> 24:31.860]  When I crossed those, I knew that the potency would be off the charts.
[24:31.860 --> 24:35.420]  The trichome development on these plants will be ridiculous.
[24:35.420 --> 24:38.220]  The flavors and aromas are crazy.
[24:38.220 --> 24:40.580]  The blueberry cookies really dominates the flavor.
[24:40.580 --> 24:45.260]  You get that blue Skittles, blueberry cookies, blue raspberry sort of a flavor, but then
[24:45.260 --> 24:50.060]  it's got a wonderful, disgusting, skunky, OG Kush thing in the back end of it that
[24:50.060 --> 24:51.720]  you don't notice until you exhale.
[24:51.720 --> 24:55.580]  You inhale and it's straight up candy and deliciousness, and then you blow it out and
[24:55.580 --> 24:57.460]  you're like, oh, that is dank.
[24:57.460 --> 24:59.020]  It's two different flavors in your mouth.
[24:59.020 --> 25:00.020]  It is really amazing.
[25:00.020 --> 25:01.700]  So that is the Bebop.
[25:01.700 --> 25:05.820]  The main thing about her is that she is the longest flowering one out of the line and
[25:05.820 --> 25:11.180]  she's going to get tall, but she makes up for it with amazing potency and tremendous
[25:11.180 --> 25:12.180]  flavor.
[25:12.180 --> 25:14.780]  You've got the space, the height, and the patience.
[25:14.780 --> 25:16.600]  Bebop is a great one for you.
[25:16.600 --> 25:20.460]  The last one in this line that we're going to talk about is what is left, the one called
[25:20.460 --> 25:22.220]  Rocksteady.
[25:22.220 --> 25:27.220]  Rocksteady is a Durban poison female pollinated by the reversed blueberry cookies.
[25:27.220 --> 25:29.020]  This one is one of my favorites.
[25:29.020 --> 25:32.220]  It is also a huge crowd pleaser.
[25:32.220 --> 25:38.020]  Rocksteady grows ridiculously fast and makes ridiculously giant buds.
[25:38.020 --> 25:40.420]  Rocksteady is going to get tall like the rest of these plants.
[25:40.660 --> 25:43.420]  She will finish in that eight to 10 week timeframe.
[25:43.420 --> 25:47.360]  Something to think about with Rocksteady is it does not like as much water as the rest
[25:47.360 --> 25:48.900]  of these crosses.
[25:48.900 --> 25:53.020]  Coming from that Durban poison female, it wants a little bit less water than the rest
[25:53.020 --> 25:54.940]  of the plants, so pay attention.
[25:54.940 --> 25:57.920]  Also, it likes to widen out real far.
[25:57.920 --> 26:01.280]  You will get a real big top cola, but then you'll get some branches that want to kind
[26:01.280 --> 26:03.280]  of stretch out and make some space.
[26:03.280 --> 26:08.100]  She is going to need cages or supports, or she works wonderfully in a screen of green
[26:08.100 --> 26:09.100]  system.
[26:09.100 --> 26:11.380]  She programs herself automatically to reach out.
[26:11.380 --> 26:12.980]  She is beautiful in a screen of green.
[26:12.980 --> 26:15.140]  You can really weave her in there super nicely.
[26:15.140 --> 26:18.840]  Now, the flavors that come off of Rocksteady are hard to describe.
[26:18.840 --> 26:21.100]  Of course, it's got that blueberry cookies flavor.
[26:21.100 --> 26:25.380]  It's got that blue raspberry thing going on to it, but then you put that Durban poison.
[26:25.380 --> 26:29.480]  I think Durban poison has a hint of mint in the background of the aroma, and then everybody
[26:29.480 --> 26:34.000]  describes that other flavor as anise oil, which I'm not sure if I've ever smelled real
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.700]  anise, but it's got that Durban poison, sort of a peppery sort of a thing, sort of a mint
[26:38.700 --> 26:41.700]  thing going on with that blueberry cookies thing.
[26:41.700 --> 26:44.780]  And it also creates sort of a raspberry kind of aroma.
[26:44.780 --> 26:49.580]  I really don't know where the raspberry comes from, but many of the phenotypes have a raspberry
[26:49.580 --> 26:53.280]  aroma and flavor coming off of them, and I really enjoy it.
[26:53.280 --> 26:55.180]  Maybe some of that flavor is blackberries as well.
[26:55.180 --> 26:59.060]  It's got that sort of a tart thing that a fresh berries got, but it also has that fruity
[26:59.060 --> 27:00.060]  thing.
[27:00.060 --> 27:01.060]  So it's really complex.
[27:01.060 --> 27:02.060]  It's really unique.
[27:02.060 --> 27:05.780]  It's kind of hard to describe other than that blue raspberry flavor with that perfect Durban
[27:05.780 --> 27:07.180]  poison combination to it.
[27:07.180 --> 27:11.660]  That is exactly what you thought it would taste like if you cross those two together.
[27:11.660 --> 27:17.220]  So I think that is enough on the breakdown of Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, Raphael,
[27:17.220 --> 27:18.920]  Bebop, and Rocksteady.
[27:18.920 --> 27:22.260]  Just to wrap it up, all of them are going to grow fairly tall.
[27:22.260 --> 27:27.020]  The ones that are going to bush out a little bit more for you are the Michelangelo and
[27:27.020 --> 27:28.140]  the Bebop.
[27:28.140 --> 27:31.200]  The Rocksteady is going to grow a little more sideways.
[27:31.200 --> 27:32.740]  It's not going to exactly bush out.
[27:32.740 --> 27:35.980]  It branches out, and those branches need supports.
[27:35.980 --> 27:40.260]  It kind of looks like most of the Durban poison crosses want to stay lower to the ground and
[27:40.260 --> 27:43.200]  bush out a little bit and then produce one big top.
[27:43.200 --> 27:46.040]  So if we train them, if we give them some supports, they really work well.
[27:46.040 --> 27:48.100]  They lift themselves up and they work beautifully.
[27:48.100 --> 27:51.020]  I love that flavor and aroma and the potency can't be beat.
[27:51.020 --> 27:53.180]  So I'm going to keep working with the Durban poison.
[27:53.180 --> 27:55.060]  That is an excellent strain.
[27:55.060 --> 27:57.980]  Rocksteady may need a little extra attention out of all of those, but if you're running
[27:57.980 --> 28:01.120]  a screen of green, that is the ideal strain for you.
[28:01.240 --> 28:06.640]  All of these strains are going to produce crazy, ridiculous candy, out of control fruity
[28:06.640 --> 28:07.640]  turps.
[28:07.640 --> 28:10.160]  You're going to need some sort of odor control.
[28:10.160 --> 28:15.200]  And to wrap it all up, most of them are going to finish in about 8 to 10 weeks.
[28:15.200 --> 28:17.100]  Of course, that is phenotype dependent.
[28:17.100 --> 28:18.680]  That is environment dependent.
[28:18.680 --> 28:24.240]  That could be nutrient, light, humidity dependent, but most of them will take about 56 to 70
[28:24.240 --> 28:25.240]  days to be finished.
[28:25.240 --> 28:30.480]  Now, I didn't go too deep into specific phenotypes to look for within each strain.
[28:30.840 --> 28:35.200]  Most of the time, honestly, it is going to be about a 50-50 mix of each parent.
[28:35.200 --> 28:38.120]  You're going to find things that look a lot like the blueberry cookies, and then you're
[28:38.120 --> 28:41.560]  going to find things that look a lot like the female I crossed it to, and then you'll
[28:41.560 --> 28:44.880]  find things that kind of dominate or are 50-50 mixes.
[28:44.880 --> 28:50.220]  You're going to find very close representations to both parents and beautiful combinations
[28:50.220 --> 28:51.860]  in every pack.
[28:51.860 --> 28:56.160]  So that is a quick breakdown on six of my favorite feminized lines.
[28:56.160 --> 28:59.780]  I do have more feminized seeds coming out in July.
[28:59.780 --> 29:03.780]  We will talk about one of those strains on the show in the very near future.
[29:03.780 --> 29:07.020]  If you would like more information about any of those strains, or if you'd like to see
[29:07.020 --> 29:10.740]  photos, there are highly detailed descriptions on my website.
[29:10.740 --> 29:14.660]  My website is irygeneticscolorado.com.
[29:14.660 --> 29:16.180]  Click on the genetics tab.
[29:16.180 --> 29:19.420]  All of the information on all of the strains will be available.
[29:19.420 --> 29:23.580]  I do know that the website isn't the most advanced piece of technology on the planet.
[29:23.580 --> 29:27.820]  All of the information you need is currently there, and we are updating the website behind
[29:27.820 --> 29:29.900]  the scenes as we speak.
[29:29.900 --> 29:35.100]  If you are interested in acquiring Irygenetic seeds, you can find them at seedsherenow.com.
[29:35.100 --> 29:38.140]  My seeds are also available at Oregoneliteseeds.com.
[29:38.140 --> 29:43.420]  Also, you can find my stuff at dankseed.store.
[29:43.420 --> 29:46.580]  Every time I release feminized seeds, they sell out very quickly.
[29:46.580 --> 29:50.200]  So if they do not have what you're looking for, have no fear because I will make more
[29:50.200 --> 29:52.740]  of all of these lines in the very near future.
[29:52.740 --> 29:56.540]  All right, podcast world, it is time for me to start wrapping up the show.
