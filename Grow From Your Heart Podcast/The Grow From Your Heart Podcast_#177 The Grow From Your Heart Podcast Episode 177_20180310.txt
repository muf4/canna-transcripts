[00:01.400 --> 00:22.320]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis community. It's time for episode number 177 of the Grow From
[00:22.320 --> 00:26.240]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:26.240 --> 00:29.880]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:29.880 --> 00:33.960]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:33.960 --> 00:39.480]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:39.480 --> 00:43.160]  host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As
[00:43.160 --> 00:46.440]  always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.440 --> 00:50.600]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
[00:50.600 --> 00:58.000]  Mystic Roots crew. Yeah, I want to give a huge shout out to my huge audience. You guys,
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.520]  the podcast was ranked number 963 on Stitcher. Stitcher hosts, I think they brag that they
[01:04.520 --> 01:09.520]  have 50,000 podcasts available on their service. And the Grow From Your Heart podcast was recently
[01:09.520 --> 01:15.880]  ranked number 963 overall. So I want to thank everybody for listening on Stitcher. I want
[01:15.880 --> 01:19.520]  to thank everybody for listening. Also on Stitcher, we were ranked number 80 in the
[01:19.520 --> 01:24.240]  society and culture category. So we were in a top 100 section on Stitcher. It makes me
[01:24.240 --> 01:27.980]  super proud. Thank you guys for listening, for supporting the show. iTunes doesn't show
[01:27.980 --> 01:31.200]  me a lot of stats or anything. iTunes doesn't give a shit. So I don't know where I stand
[01:31.200 --> 01:35.740]  on iTunes, but on Stitcher, we are crushing it. Big thanks to everybody. Also, big thank
[01:35.740 --> 01:40.340]  you to everybody who listened to the episode with Solventless Shannon and Davin Granny.
[01:40.340 --> 01:44.560]  That was a great episode. Also, Lindsey and Chris were here. Yes, they did put some stuff
[01:44.560 --> 01:47.740]  in their butt. I got a couple of messages that said, hey bro, as soon as you guys started
[01:47.740 --> 01:50.940]  talking about putting things in your butt, I checked out. One of my friends said that
[01:50.940 --> 01:54.860]  he was getting some mental images and some visuals, and he did not want to contaminate
[01:54.860 --> 01:58.780]  his brain like that. So he listened to about three minutes of the show and checked out.
[01:58.780 --> 02:02.340]  I apologize if that was too much for you, but thanks for everybody. Thanks to everybody
[02:02.340 --> 02:06.340]  that listened to the podcast. I appreciate it. Also, big thanks to Solventless Shannon
[02:06.340 --> 02:09.820]  and Davin Granny for coming and being on the podcast. I look forward to having both of
[02:09.820 --> 02:13.700]  those lovely ladies on the podcast again, and you know we will get the Traveling Stoner
[02:13.700 --> 02:17.980]  and Bobo Blasterco back on the show real soon. Shout out, kids. I hope you guys are doing
[02:17.980 --> 02:23.500]  well. Let's see. Where else am I? Handmade. Big shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.

[02:49.780 --> 02:52.540]  Let them know you learned about them from the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Tell them
[02:52.540 --> 02:56.820]  Rostage F sent you. They will take great care of you. All right. I am pulling up a message
[02:56.820 --> 03:00.660]  on my phone here, but I've got an iPhone and it's acting funny. You know how that shit
[03:00.660 --> 03:03.580]  goes. It's like you're listening to music. You have to unlock me. You have to do eight
[03:03.580 --> 03:08.180]  other things to get to the message you want. I've got the message. Here we go. I want to
[03:08.180 --> 03:12.300]  give a huge shout out to my friend Mountain Smokes. A few episodes back, I did an episode
[03:12.300 --> 03:16.620]  called Follow Your Nose, and I talked about sour diesel and Hispanic folks. I felt like
[03:16.620 --> 03:22.100]  I may be a bit racist calling out the folks of Latin descent for liking sour diesel, but
[03:22.100 --> 03:26.740]  I felt that was something that I noticed. My friend Mountain Smokes on Snapchat sent
[03:26.740 --> 03:32.020]  me a message. She said, oh my gosh, the sour diesel bit. So true. Being from Gunnison County,
[03:32.020 --> 03:36.500]  another heavily populated area, sour diesel has always been growing in the basements and
[03:36.500 --> 03:41.380]  it was by far the most popular strain I sold there. Spot on. Then she also says, also love
[03:41.380 --> 03:47.100]  the podcast once again, and yes, follow your nose. So very true. Thanks for the message
[03:47.100 --> 03:51.220]  and big shout out to my friend Mountain Smokes on Snapchat. Make sure you follow her on Snapchat.
[03:51.220 --> 03:55.060]  She's a cutie. She smokes cannabis. She's a great cannabis activist and she is learning
[03:55.060 --> 03:59.340]  a whole bunch and becoming very knowledgeable and she likes to share that stuff with her
[03:59.340 --> 04:04.460]  viewers on Snap. So check her out and follow her. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to get
[04:04.460 --> 04:09.320]  right to an email. I've got a long email here about powdery mildew and I feel like I can
[04:09.320 --> 04:14.100]  really give some help. So I'm pulling up the email while I talk. Where is it? Here we go.
[04:14.100 --> 04:20.240]  All right. The email goes like this. Yo, love the podcast. Long time listener. Hashtag love
[04:20.240 --> 04:24.100]  it when you ramble. Shout out to White Mike. White Mike, you got a shout out, bro. Hope
[04:24.100 --> 04:28.340]  you heard that. You guys will get White Mike back on the podcast real soon. He'll be here.
[04:28.340 --> 04:31.620]  He's got a young child. He's got a wife. He's got a life. He can't be on every episode,
[04:31.620 --> 04:34.980]  but we'll get him back pretty soon. Shout out, bro. I hope you're doing well. The message
[04:34.980 --> 04:40.020]  goes on to say, anyways, I will keep this short. I work at a commercial scale cultivation
[04:40.020 --> 04:45.020]  site and we have been fighting powdery mildew for a year now and would love some help. We
[04:45.020 --> 04:51.540]  have sprayed fucking everything and I'm starting to tap out. It's indoor and it's in the desert.
[04:51.540 --> 04:54.940]  Any thoughts? And then he signs it. Thanks. And then his name, I'm not sure if he wants
[04:54.940 --> 04:59.540]  everybody. Oh, he does. He says, PS, you can say my name. We out here. So thanks. Matthias
[04:59.540 --> 05:07.540]  585 on Instagram. It's M A T H I U S 585 on Instagram. Follow him if you want to. All
[05:07.540 --> 05:11.500]  right. Let's talk a little bit about your powdery mildew situation. There are a lot
[05:11.500 --> 05:16.220]  of things we can spray and things we can do to help treat and correct this problem. But
[05:16.220 --> 05:20.180]  what I'm mainly concerned with is why is it there? How did it show up in the first place?
[05:20.180 --> 05:25.340]  And is it going to come back? Um, since you say you've sprayed fucking everything, it
[05:25.340 --> 05:30.220]  makes me think that you have issues with the room. Obviously there is not enough airflow.
[05:30.220 --> 05:34.500]  You're not getting rid of the old air. You're not bringing in enough fresh air. Uh, possibly
[05:34.500 --> 05:38.900]  there are temperature fluctuations. There are a lot of things like that that are going
[05:38.900 --> 05:43.660]  to be causing problems. Are you running a hydro grow or a soil grow? If it's hydro,
[05:43.660 --> 05:47.280]  you've got a lot of water in there. You're going to have to control the temperature.
[05:47.280 --> 05:51.240]  If it's hydro, you may need to get some chillers and cool the water because that'll prevent
[05:51.240 --> 05:56.400]  the water from becoming a vapor, which becomes humidity, which promotes the powdery mildew.
[05:56.400 --> 06:00.280]  Uh, if you're running with rock wool cubes, you may need to let them dry a little more.
[06:00.280 --> 06:04.680]  If you're running soil, you may be getting the soil too wet. How much water is in the
[06:04.680 --> 06:10.240]  grow facility itself? Do you have water available to evaporate to make condensation in there?
[06:10.240 --> 06:14.200]  That's going to help you get powdery mildew, too much moisture, too much water. You said
[06:14.200 --> 06:17.920]  you're in the desert, so too much moisture, too much water. The outside is hot. The inside's
[06:17.920 --> 06:21.960]  real moisture, creating a bubble filled with humidity in there, and that's going to contribute
[06:21.960 --> 06:26.200]  to your powdery mildew. So you need heavy dehumidification in that room. You need to
[06:26.200 --> 06:31.200]  get that old hot stale air out. You need to get some fresh air in. You need some ventilation.
[06:31.200 --> 06:35.080]  Um, hopefully you're treating the air that's coming in. That's something we should talk
[06:35.080 --> 06:39.760]  about. You need to get that old stale air out, stale air out, of course, but there's
[06:39.760 --> 06:45.200]  fresh air coming in. That fresh air coming in does need to be treated. You need a filter,
[06:45.200 --> 06:50.560]  and also they make a UV light that is very good at killing powdery mildew. It will kill
[06:50.560 --> 06:56.420]  any spores that come in. They make a light that goes over your ducting. So the ducting,
[06:56.420 --> 07:00.160]  the intake ducting comes in, and then this light shines through the ducting, and everything
[07:00.160 --> 07:05.080]  that passes through that duct is basically killed. So I would use HEPA filters on all
[07:05.080 --> 07:12.080]  of the intakes, and I would use the UV lighting on all of the venting and ducting if you can.
[07:12.080 --> 07:15.480]  If you can pass all of the air through one thing and run a UV light over it, that would
[07:15.480 --> 07:20.540]  be ideal. They sell things called clean lights. They are UV lights that are designed for gardens.
[07:20.540 --> 07:24.360]  They're mostly used in like the strawberry industry because strawberries get a lot of
[07:24.360 --> 07:28.200]  powdery mildew on them. They sell handheld versions of these lights that you can actually
[07:28.200 --> 07:32.360]  walk around the crop and shine this light over the entire crop, and you just run it
[07:32.360 --> 07:37.600]  over. Just basically you want to illuminate every inch of the canopy for about a half
[07:37.600 --> 07:40.560]  a second to two seconds. So you just wave your hand. I'm waving my hand over it right
[07:40.560 --> 07:43.660]  now like you guys can see what I'm doing, but it's basically the same motion you make
[07:43.660 --> 07:46.440]  when you're watering. You know, you just move your hand around, blah, blah, blah, back and
[07:46.440 --> 07:50.520]  forth like a windshield wiper. You do that with this light, and you walk over the canopy
[07:50.520 --> 07:54.380]  and just make sure that the light shines on every leaf, and that light kills the powdery
[07:54.380 --> 07:58.640]  mildew. It takes several applications of that light to get rid of powdery mildew if you
[07:58.640 --> 08:03.080]  already have it, but if you're persistent with it, that will help. So the room needs
[08:03.080 --> 08:09.040]  to be corrected. There may be some water issues. You may need some equipment, some dehumidification.
[08:09.040 --> 08:13.500]  You need some air exchange. Temperature control is huge. You can't have huge swings. Huge
[08:13.500 --> 08:18.500]  temperature swings in the night and in the day are going to cause powdery mildew issues.
[08:18.500 --> 08:23.440]  So that's what I think about the room. Let's talk about the plants. How far apart are your
[08:23.440 --> 08:28.040]  plants? Are they touching? If the plant leaves are laying on top of each other in that little
[08:28.040 --> 08:33.240]  space, imagine if we're sitting in a room and I just put my hand on, this sounds disgusting
[08:33.240 --> 08:37.960]  to me, but what if I just put my hand on your leg? In my hot hand, I'm 96 degrees or whatever
[08:37.960 --> 08:42.040]  I am, my hand is just sitting on your leg. In about 20 or 30 minutes, there's going to
[08:42.040 --> 08:46.040]  be a hot sweaty spot there. Just from our body parts touching and getting warm, there's
[08:46.040 --> 08:49.960]  going to be a little bit of sweat in there. That sweat that those plants create will cause
[08:49.960 --> 08:53.520]  powdery mildew right there between those two leaves, and it'll start spreading from there
[08:53.520 --> 09:00.360]  rapidly. So something you can really help defoliate heavily. When I'm in a large commercial
[09:00.360 --> 09:06.480]  facility, we spend days just defoliating. Sometimes it'll be defoliation day. You guys
[09:06.480 --> 09:09.660]  get super stoned on your break because when you come back, all you're doing is pulling
[09:09.660 --> 09:14.080]  leaves for the next eight hours. Just pluck every leaf with the petiole out of that room.
[09:14.080 --> 09:17.740]  If you're, I'm not sure if you're the manager, if you're the boss, or if you're the owner,
[09:17.740 --> 09:21.960]  but if you are able to, pull every leaf that you can out of there. Those leaves are where
[09:21.960 --> 09:26.920]  the powdery mildew happens. Get it out of there. So that's what you can do for the plant.
[09:26.920 --> 09:31.800]  Spread them out. Take off all the big leaves. Put some air on them. Fan them around. If
[09:31.800 --> 09:35.600]  the powdery mildew can't develop because it's blown around too much, it can't develop. If
[09:35.600 --> 09:40.720]  the humidity doesn't stay stagnant, the powdery mildew will have a harder time developing.
[09:40.720 --> 09:45.480]  So let's talk about, you said you've sprayed everything. I bet your plants look pissed
[09:45.480 --> 09:48.800]  off. They've got powdery mildew, and you're spraying them with stuff, and they're trying
[09:48.800 --> 09:51.720]  to fight the powdery mildew, and then they're getting shit sprayed on them frequently. I
[09:51.720 --> 09:55.800]  bet they're getting mad. I bet you're getting frustrated as hell. Stay positive, bro. We're
[09:55.800 --> 10:00.780]  going to beat this shit. I'm curious what you've sprayed, because sometimes your sprays
[10:00.780 --> 10:05.340]  are going to add more moisture. It's going to add more humidity. I've sprayed commercial
[10:05.340 --> 10:08.520]  rooms thinking, yay, I just got rid of powdery mildew. And I came back the next day, and
[10:08.520 --> 10:12.360]  the powdery mildew was actually thicker. Drove me fucking nuts. So like I'm saying, you've
[10:12.360 --> 10:16.000]  got to fix the room. You have to spread the plants apart. If you've got a bunch of water
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.040]  on the floor, squeegee and chop back that shit up. Get rid of that extra water. So let's
[10:20.040 --> 10:26.280]  talk about sprays. What have you sprayed? I'm really curious. There is a product called
[10:26.280 --> 10:31.920]  Big Time Exterminator that I have heard works wonders on powdery mildew. It's organic, and
[10:31.920 --> 10:36.320]  it is... Okay, here's something I should mention. In Colorado, we are very limited on products
[10:36.320 --> 10:40.360]  that we can use. A lot of people will say, go get a bottle of Eagle 20 and spray that
[10:40.360 --> 10:45.120]  shit right on your plants. Eagle 20 will get rid of your powdery mildew. It may take one
[10:45.120 --> 10:49.560]  application. It may take two applications, but your powdery mildew will be gone for 30
[10:49.560 --> 10:56.320]  days, maybe 45 to 60 days guaranteed. I personally do not like Eagle 20. There are a lot of deadly,
[10:56.320 --> 11:01.320]  dangerous, shitty chemicals in there that we do not need to spray on our plants that
[11:01.320 --> 11:07.480]  we are going to call medicine to give to sick people. I do not recommend Eagle 20. In Colorado,
[11:07.480 --> 11:11.820]  Eagle 20 is completely banned. We are not allowed to use it in a recreational or a medical
[11:11.820 --> 11:16.800]  facility that is regulated by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division. It is a banned
[11:16.800 --> 11:21.520]  product. I like that some products are banned. It keeps us safe. It keeps our growers safe.
[11:21.520 --> 11:25.760]  It keeps the consumers safe. We haven't done enough research on a lot of these chemicals
[11:25.760 --> 11:30.180]  to know what's going to happen to us if we smoke it. A lot of these things affect your
[11:30.180 --> 11:35.660]  body in a way that... Say I spray my plants with Eagle 20 today, and we let them flower,
[11:35.660 --> 11:40.200]  we harvest them, we cut them down. That's probably 50 to 60 days. You let them dry.
[11:40.200 --> 11:45.120]  You smoke it. There's probably still Eagle 20 on those buds. When I smoke it, I don't
[11:45.120 --> 11:48.120]  think I'm going to notice anything right away. I may get a funky taste. My throat may
[11:48.120 --> 11:52.600]  burn, but that's it. I'm thinking that in 10 years is when I'm going to notice the fuck
[11:52.600 --> 11:56.440]  up from that. I'm going to get a twitch. My left eye is going to pop out. I'm going to
[11:56.440 --> 12:01.400]  talk funny. I might get a limp or even a bigger fear. Maybe it does something to my DNA or
[12:01.400 --> 12:07.120]  my RNA. I don't plan on having any more kids, but maybe you do. Maybe it'll fuck up your
[12:07.120 --> 12:11.760]  RNA and your DNA, and your kids will come out with three arms or three eyes or one foot
[12:11.760 --> 12:17.120]  or 14 toes. We don't know enough about what these... These chemicals kill mildews, and
[12:17.120 --> 12:21.960]  they kill bugs. It's doing something biologically or something. It depends on what kind of chemical
[12:21.960 --> 12:24.760]  you're using, but it's doing something. It could be getting into your body and fucking
[12:24.760 --> 12:27.880]  up your body by smoking it. We need to be really careful.
[12:27.880 --> 12:32.320]  I know I got way off topic, just on a rant there, but if you want to spray Eagle 20,
[12:32.320 --> 12:35.700]  go in there. Hit that shit with Eagle 20. Problem solved. You got a little bit of time
[12:35.700 --> 12:38.960]  to figure out how to fix the rooms, and then hopefully you can fix it again and not ever
[12:38.960 --> 12:44.320]  have to use the Eagle 20 again. I don't recommend that shit, you guys, at all. At all, at all.
[12:44.320 --> 12:48.360]  Things that we are allowed to use in Colorado. A product called Big Time Exterminator. It's
[12:48.360 --> 12:52.800]  mostly citrus oil or citrus... It's citrus something. I think it's citrus oil. Mostly
[12:52.800 --> 12:59.040]  citrus oil extract. It smells like oranges. It's got a nice lemony smell, orangey smell,
[12:59.040 --> 13:05.560]  citrusy smell to it. I mixed that up. I think I put... I did... Whatever the bucket says,
[13:05.560 --> 13:10.040]  there's ingredients on the bucket. Go the heavy route. Mix it up with some water. Spray
[13:10.040 --> 13:15.080]  that right on the plants, and that stuff should calm down the powdery mildew. You may have
[13:15.080 --> 13:19.460]  to go for a few applications of that. That'll take care of your powdery mildew.
[13:19.460 --> 13:26.460]  Another product that I have seen work on powdery mildew is 30% hydrogen peroxide. I saw a guy
[13:27.640 --> 13:34.320]  put 50 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide in a five-gallon bucket and sprayed that directly...
[13:34.320 --> 13:39.920]  He adjusted the pH and then sprayed that directly onto the entire crop. You could see
[13:39.920 --> 13:45.400]  the hydrogen peroxide break down the powdery mildew. He sprayed the entire crop, and then
[13:45.400 --> 13:49.880]  he went ahead and sprayed the entire room. Sprayed everything down. Everything smelled
[13:49.880 --> 13:54.280]  like hydrogen peroxide. It smelled super clean in there. It took several applications. I
[13:54.280 --> 13:58.980]  think he was going at it daily, but by the end of a week, the powdery mildew was gone.
[13:58.980 --> 14:03.680]  You can use PM wash. You can use hydrogen peroxide. You can use... Sorry, I didn't say
[14:03.720 --> 14:07.560]  PM wash. There's a product called PM wash, which I haven't used it, but I've read great
[14:07.560 --> 14:13.600]  things about it. The PM wash should wash the powdery mildew off of your plants.
[14:13.600 --> 14:17.640]  Peroxide, PM wash, and big-time exterminator are three products that you can buy. You can
[14:17.640 --> 14:22.040]  order them over the internet. You could probably buy them at your local growth stores. Those
[14:22.040 --> 14:27.520]  products, I'm told, will get rid of your powdery mildew. I have seen the hydrogen peroxide
[14:27.520 --> 14:31.040]  do it. I've seen the big-time exterminator do it. It'll take multiple applications. You
[14:31.040 --> 14:34.680]  have to be persistent. You have to pay attention to the plants. They're going to need a little
[14:34.680 --> 14:38.600]  bit of love after this. If you're going to spray them for several days with a product
[14:38.600 --> 14:42.960]  like big-time exterminator or hydrogen peroxide, I recommend give them a day of rest and then
[14:42.960 --> 14:48.160]  spray them with Push from our friends at Vegbloom. They do not pay me to talk about their products,
[14:48.160 --> 14:51.920]  but Push is an amazing product. It's a foliar product. It's a little hard to get. It's a
[14:51.920 --> 14:55.920]  little bit expensive, but oh my God, it's worth every penny. If you're going to do this
[14:55.920 --> 15:00.500]  much damage and this much beating up to your plants, I think Push would be really helpful.
[15:00.500 --> 15:05.040]  Another product I can recommend is a product called Stilett Oil. Stilett Oil is not allowed
[15:05.040 --> 15:10.220]  to be used in a recreational or commercial facility in Colorado, but I have used it myself
[15:10.220 --> 15:15.780]  and it did take care of everything. Stilett Oil is an oil that coats your plant and it
[15:15.780 --> 15:20.900]  will not allow the powdery mildew to grow on the plant. It will not allow fungus nets
[15:20.900 --> 15:24.660]  to gather on the plant. It won't let mites get on the bottom side of the plant. Nothing
[15:24.660 --> 15:29.180]  wants anything to do with Stilett Oil. The problem with Stilett Oil is it strips the
[15:29.180 --> 15:32.900]  cuticles off your plant leaves and it leaves them really vulnerable and they look a little
[15:32.900 --> 15:38.060]  leathery. They get kind of sad at you about it. If you're going to use Stilett Oil, I
[15:38.060 --> 15:43.540]  would, if your plants are small enough, I would dunk the plants into a Stilett Oil,
[15:43.540 --> 15:46.820]  dilute it heavily. Don't go straight into the oil. Sorry, let me say that. Mix up some
[15:46.820 --> 15:50.900]  Stilett Oil. I cannot think of the dilution recommendations, but it is on the bottle.
[15:50.900 --> 15:56.180]  Go light. Dunk the plant into the Stilett Oil. Get every leaf in there. Give it a good
[15:56.180 --> 16:01.180]  wiggle. Pull it out. Set it back in the grow area. Turn off the lights. Let it dry. Give
[16:01.180 --> 16:04.380]  it about an hour. Let all of the plants dry after you've dunked everything and then go
[16:04.380 --> 16:09.620]  back with the sprayer and hose off every single plant. The Stilett Oil will dry and coat and
[16:09.620 --> 16:13.560]  then you just want to kind of rinse off the excess and all of your powdery mildew and
[16:13.560 --> 16:19.060]  bugs should be removed within the first application. Stilett Oil will fuck your plants up. If they're
[16:19.060 --> 16:23.420]  not strong, it's going to beat the shit out of them. Maybe test a couple of plants because
[16:23.540 --> 16:27.500]  it does beat your plants up heavily, but it will work.
[16:27.500 --> 16:30.660]  I had almost forgotten about the Stilett Oil. Where are you located, man? I've got a huge
[16:30.660 --> 16:35.820]  bottle of JMS Stilett Oil that I do not think I'm going to use. If you're near me, we can
[16:35.820 --> 16:39.980]  work out a deal. Just fucking, I want to see what happens when you use it. Let's see, where
[16:39.980 --> 16:44.860]  am I now? Another thing that we can talk about, our friend Frosty Organics was on the podcast
[16:44.860 --> 16:50.460]  quite a while back and he talked about lactic acid bacteria spray. Frosty taught us that
[16:50.460 --> 16:54.300]  he can make his own lactic acid bacteria spray and apply it to the plants and he says
[16:54.300 --> 16:59.460]  that one application will remove his powdery mildew issue. I'm not sure how well that works.
[16:59.460 --> 17:04.220]  I have not tried it myself, but I do trust the shit out of Frosty Organics. If you want
[17:04.220 --> 17:08.940]  to learn about lactic acid bacteria and how to treat your cannabis plants with it, you
[17:08.940 --> 17:15.020]  can Google lactic acid bacteria and then powdery mildew and then there will be the word Clackamas
[17:15.020 --> 17:19.820]  in there. Clackamas is a city in Oregon. There's a guy named Clackamas Coot who is from that
[17:19.820 --> 17:24.260]  part of Oregon who wrote an article about making lactic acid bacteria to treat for
[17:24.260 --> 17:28.940]  powdery mildew. If you Google it, it should not be too hard to find.
[17:28.940 --> 17:33.580]  Guys, something else I want to mention, in professional horticultural applications and
[17:33.580 --> 17:38.900]  environments, what is commonly used for powdery mildew is a product called potassium bicarbonate.
[17:38.900 --> 17:42.860]  It's available in several different forms from what I read. They say that it mixes up
[17:42.860 --> 17:46.860]  very much like a baking soda in water and you apply that to your plants as a foliar
[17:46.860 --> 17:51.980]  spray and that disrupts the pH on the surface of the leaf, which will get rid of your powdery
[17:51.980 --> 17:57.140]  mildew. It is a horticultural standard. It's what they use in large greenhouses for large
[17:57.140 --> 18:02.720]  production. Potassium bicarbonate, from what I read, it comes in a very powdery form that's
[18:02.720 --> 18:06.900]  like baking soda. They say it's available in other forms. Check that out. Maybe that's
[18:06.900 --> 18:10.260]  something that will help you out. If you're in a commercial grow, I'm not sure if that
[18:10.260 --> 18:14.300]  will be legal. Make sure you check out all of the laws. I don't know where you are. I
[18:14.540 --> 18:20.460]  don't know the rules. Everything I say needs to be researched before you apply it.
[18:20.460 --> 18:23.780]  Another thing that people are going to recommend for you for your powdery mildew issue, people
[18:23.780 --> 18:28.460]  are going to say to hang a sulfur burner in the grow and run the sulfur burner for an
[18:28.460 --> 18:32.180]  hour or 45 minutes every few hours or something like that. Everyone's going to have their
[18:32.180 --> 18:37.900]  own recipe. I highly advise against this, you guys. I do not like a sulfur burner. There
[18:37.900 --> 18:42.740]  was a dispensary in Colorado. I will not call them out. They were in Denver. They were a
[18:42.740 --> 18:46.620]  very, very well-known dispensary. They had a very well-known breeder working with them
[18:46.620 --> 18:51.780]  who actually left and started his own thing. That facility was having a powdery mildew
[18:51.780 --> 18:58.500]  issue and their solution was to run a sulfur burner. The results were for about six months,
[18:58.500 --> 19:02.220]  every time you would shop at that dispensary, everything would have ... At first, it was
[19:02.220 --> 19:06.660]  a flavor of sulfur. You would smoke it and you'd be like, why does this taste weird?
[19:06.660 --> 19:09.780]  It was sulfur. Once somebody would say, I think there's a sulfur burner, your brain
[19:09.780 --> 19:13.420]  would go, oh yeah, it totally tastes like sulfur. It was really strong at first. Over
[19:13.420 --> 19:16.700]  a few months, it faded out, but you could taste it for a long time. They've gotten rid
[19:16.700 --> 19:20.640]  of the sulfur burner. They've corrected their problem. Now, it doesn't happen, but that's
[19:20.640 --> 19:26.580]  why you don't run a sulfur burner in there. It will make your plants taste like shit.
[19:26.580 --> 19:30.820]  Don't do the sulfur burner. That's not something I would recommend.
[19:30.820 --> 19:35.220]  Something that you can do that may help you. I'm not sure if you're using mother plants
[19:35.220 --> 19:39.020]  or if you're taking plants, taking cuts from your vegging plants or how that works, but
[19:39.140 --> 19:44.860]  when you were taking clones, I recommend dunking them. I cut my clone from the mother plant.
[19:44.860 --> 19:49.940]  I put them in a cup with water and a small bit of nutrients. Then I carry that cup filled
[19:49.940 --> 19:55.420]  with cuttings to another area where they are trimmed up. Then they are dunked into a solution.
[19:55.420 --> 20:00.460]  Then they are dipped and then stuck into either the cloner, if I'm working at one facility,
[20:00.460 --> 20:03.740]  or they're put into plugs if I'm at another facility, or they're put in a rock wool at
[20:03.740 --> 20:06.340]  another facility. It just depends on where I'm working and who I'm working with, what
[20:06.340 --> 20:11.340]  I've got going on. After the cut, I like to dunk the freshly cut clone and trimmed
[20:11.340 --> 20:15.780]  up. You cut off the leaves, you trim off all the extra. Then I dunk that right into something.
[20:15.780 --> 20:22.780]  I will change my product up. Sometimes I use Banish. Sometimes I will use the, what's it
[20:22.780 --> 20:27.140]  called, the big time exterminator. You guys, I wrote down BTE and I can always forget that
[20:27.140 --> 20:31.340]  stands for big time exterminator. Sometimes I'll mix up the hydrogen peroxide. It just
[20:31.340 --> 20:35.980]  depends on what's available and what I'm treating for, what I think I may be at risk for. We
[20:35.980 --> 20:40.300]  know that powdery mildew is the problem here. Mix up a little bit of hydrogen peroxide in
[20:40.300 --> 20:45.220]  your water. I just use a five gallon bucket. Anywhere between 30 and 70 mils of hydrogen
[20:45.220 --> 20:50.340]  peroxide usually seems to work for me. Cut the clone, dunk that right into the five gallon
[20:50.340 --> 20:55.340]  bucket of hydrogen peroxide, give it a nice hefty shake, and then put that into the Dip
[20:55.340 --> 20:59.780]  and Grow or the Clonex or whatever we're using, wherever the hell we are. Then stick that
[20:59.780 --> 21:03.940]  right into the cloner, whatever I'm going into. Then I know that I killed all of the
[21:03.940 --> 21:08.380]  powdery mildew so that I've got a fresh start so that that clone can root and have a healthy
[21:08.380 --> 21:12.140]  start. Then as soon as it roots and it gets put into its first pot, I'll spray it with
[21:12.140 --> 21:17.660]  something. Then every, I'll spray it once a week with something. Then if I see powdery
[21:17.660 --> 21:23.560]  mildew or, here's a hint, a little bit before powdery mildew starts, you will see little
[21:23.560 --> 21:29.060]  tiny bumps pop up. The leaf may start to just get a little bit bumpy. I don't even know
[21:29.060 --> 21:32.500]  how to, it just looks like a little pimple or a wart or something funky coming up on
[21:32.500 --> 21:36.560]  the leaf, but it's real small. If you start seeing that, then it's time to start treating
[21:36.560 --> 21:41.660]  for powdery mildew extra strong. Get out your UV clean light, get out your hydrogen peroxide,
[21:41.660 --> 21:47.060]  get out the PM wash, the big time exterminator, the lactic acid bacteria, the potassium bicarbonate,
[21:47.060 --> 21:50.240]  something like that. Get it out there, start treating those plants because you're going
[21:50.240 --> 21:54.380]  to see the powdery mildew. If I see that, that's when I start stepping up my game, going
[21:54.380 --> 21:58.940]  a little bit harder. One more thing I should mention is the powdery mildew could be on
[21:58.940 --> 22:02.980]  your clothes. You're carrying it around from the flower room to the bedroom to the mother
[22:02.980 --> 22:08.660]  room to the clone room. It's in your air conditioning ducts, it's in your HVAC system, it is everywhere.
[22:08.660 --> 22:13.100]  It needs to be taken care of, it needs to be treated. If you've got those silly ducts
[22:13.100 --> 22:17.260]  that have the insulation inside of them, tear that shit out of there. I know that could
[22:17.260 --> 22:22.140]  be a multi-thousand dollar job for your facility, but all of that insulation inside of there
[22:22.140 --> 22:26.660]  is harboring, harboring, that was a hard word to say, the insulation is harboring powdery
[22:26.660 --> 22:31.980]  mildew and it will eventually be a place for bugs to hide out once one gets in there.
[22:31.980 --> 22:35.900]  Just takes two and those bugs will start a party, it'll be disgusting. You could have
[22:35.900 --> 22:39.300]  the powdery mildew on your clothes. Make sure everybody's changing clothes properly. I bet
[22:39.300 --> 22:44.020]  you've got a grower that has a private grow at home and he's got powdery mildew also.
[22:44.020 --> 22:48.020]  As soon as he starts getting rid of powdery mildew, you get it worse. Then as soon as
[22:48.020 --> 22:51.500]  your facility starts getting it cleaned up, he gets it worse and you guys are just passing
[22:51.500 --> 22:56.780]  that shit back and forth and it's never going to go away. Start changing your clothes, get
[22:56.780 --> 23:01.300]  some dedicated clothes, dedicated shoes, a dedicated hat. If you've got long hair or
[23:01.300 --> 23:05.860]  dreadlocks, get it wrapped up, get it in a hat, get it covered up. I'm always going and
[23:05.860 --> 23:09.780]  re-tucking my dreads because I try to keep everything covered up. I don't want dragging
[23:09.780 --> 23:13.580]  my dreads along around the grow. I think it's gross and I need to be picking up bugs or
[23:13.580 --> 23:17.220]  leaving hair in the flowers. Just keep your dreads and your hair covered up. If you've
[23:17.220 --> 23:21.820]  got a big man, wook beard or if you've got a hipster beard, cover that shit up too. Just
[23:21.820 --> 23:26.420]  try to be clean, you guys. Another thing I really want to recommend, I did work in a
[23:26.420 --> 23:30.500]  facility that was riddled with powdery mildew. I won't call them out on a podcast. Most of
[23:30.500 --> 23:33.900]  my friends and listeners know who the fuck I'm talking about. The place was riddled with
[23:33.900 --> 23:38.260]  powdery mildew. They fired a grower. I took over. I walked in and I said, well, you've
[23:38.260 --> 23:42.060]  got bugs and powdery mildew to start with. They're like, yes, we do. Help us. I tried
[23:42.060 --> 23:46.220]  to get rid of it, you guys, but being MED regulated, I understand the struggle that
[23:46.340 --> 23:51.620]  my listener here has. It was a pain in the ass. Everybody in that grow got sick because
[23:51.620 --> 23:55.140]  of the powdery mildew. The mildew's gone, you guys. It took two or three crops, two
[23:55.140 --> 23:58.780]  or three crop cycles to get rid of it, but the powdery mildew was actually gone. We got
[23:58.780 --> 24:02.660]  rid of it in a 100 light facility. The PM was gone. You could not see it. You could
[24:02.660 --> 24:06.420]  not smell it. You could not taste it. It was cleaned up. They did their job. They got rid
[24:06.420 --> 24:13.100]  of it, but everybody got a sinus sort of thing. Everybody showed different symptoms, but everybody
[24:13.100 --> 24:17.820]  could agree that it was messing up their noses, their throat, and their eye region.
[24:17.820 --> 24:21.600]  Wear a mask. If you've got a ventilator, a respirator, or even one of those just shitty
[24:21.600 --> 24:26.020]  little paper Asian bird flu masks, just wear one of those when you're working with the
[24:26.020 --> 24:30.580]  powdery mildew because you don't want to get sick from it. I tried to deny that I was sick
[24:30.580 --> 24:36.700]  from the powdery mildew, but once it was gone, I felt better and I could tell that my allergy
[24:36.700 --> 24:40.380]  problem and my throat thing was happening because of that powdery mildew. That's what
[24:40.380 --> 24:46.260]  was doing it. So please take care of yourself. If the plants are bad, powdery mildewy, you
[24:46.260 --> 24:52.100]  have to think about if you want to release that product to the public because you don't
[24:52.100 --> 24:57.060]  want to be responsible for making people sick. So that's a moral thing you're going to have
[24:57.060 --> 25:03.100]  to think about yourself. Something that they do allow here in Colorado, they will let you
[25:03.100 --> 25:09.780]  blast the powdery mildew buds. The marijuana enforcement division has decided that it is
[25:09.780 --> 25:15.740]  safe to put powdery mildew buds and trim into a tube and run butane over it and turn
[25:15.740 --> 25:24.540]  it in to a BHO, a hash, dabs, shatter, wax. It turns into distillate eventually. It gets
[25:24.540 --> 25:29.160]  put into edibles eventually. So yeah, they're deeming it safe. So if that's what you want
[25:29.160 --> 25:32.980]  to do with it, do that. That's the best I can recommend with it. But honestly, if it's
[25:32.980 --> 25:37.320]  coated in powdery mildew, think about this. My friend Doug is getting old and Doug's got
[25:37.320 --> 25:42.380]  a lung problem. And when Doug smokes regular cannabis, he coughs. When Doug smokes cannabis
[25:42.380 --> 25:47.500]  that's got something on it, he coughs a lot and gets really sick. Doug is smoking because
[25:47.500 --> 25:52.420]  he's sick and trying to prolong and save his life. We do not want to give Doug powdery
[25:52.420 --> 25:58.420]  mildews and mycotoxins and funky shit for his lungs to kill him more quickly. I love
[25:58.420 --> 26:03.580]  Doug. I fucking want him here. Treat everybody like Doug. Okay? Everybody that's getting
[26:03.580 --> 26:08.180]  cannabis is my friend Doug in my mind. We all have to take care of all of our patients
[26:08.180 --> 26:13.280]  like they are Doug. All right. Doug is a real dude, but I kind of exaggerated his story.
[26:13.280 --> 26:16.400]  Doug's not that sick, you guys. Just wanted to use him as an example because he's a good
[26:16.400 --> 26:20.920]  dude. All right. I hope I've given you some information that kind of teaches you how to
[26:20.920 --> 26:24.800]  at least control and harness and get rid of this powdery mildew. I'm not sure what you
[26:24.800 --> 26:29.000]  can do where you are. So you can spray any of these products that you choose to spray.
[26:29.000 --> 26:34.240]  You can defoliate. Things that I fully recommend you do are get the old air out, the fresh
[26:34.240 --> 26:39.780]  air in, dehumidify, do some filtration. Also space out the plants a little bit. Make sure
[26:39.780 --> 26:44.840]  they aren't touching each other and then control temperature swings. You're in the desert and
[26:44.840 --> 26:48.880]  you're putting a bunch of water inside of a building. You're making a big Tupperware
[26:48.880 --> 26:53.520]  dish and you're making a giant comb dome is what you're doing in there. So you need to
[26:53.520 --> 26:58.640]  evacuate the humidity and get that out of the room. Don't be afraid to throw away some
[26:58.640 --> 27:01.440]  plants if they're starting to get too bad. I know that sounds terrible in a commercial
[27:01.440 --> 27:04.720]  production facility. I've been there before. Trust me, I have dealt with what you're dealing
[27:04.720 --> 27:08.200]  with. Some days it makes you want to punch yourself straight in the face. But I did an
[27:08.200 --> 27:13.920]  episode a few episodes back called stay positive. And if you didn't have powdery mildew, you
[27:13.920 --> 27:17.200]  wouldn't be getting so many hours. Should be too easy. Wouldn't be a challenge. Wouldn't
[27:17.200 --> 27:21.440]  be fun anymore. So you got to go through some struggles. And that way when those issues
[27:21.440 --> 27:25.040]  are gone, it's going to be like you're fucking cruising in the coolest damn facility ever.
[27:25.040 --> 27:27.960]  And you'll appreciate it. That's what I think. Stay positive. Don't put your hair out. Don't
[27:28.040 --> 27:31.360]  put yourself in the face. Keep growing. And dude, if you have any more questions, please
[27:31.360 --> 27:35.880]  send me an email. If anybody out there has any questions about growing cannabis, about
[27:35.880 --> 27:39.960]  smoking cannabis, about anything cannabis related, I would love to hear from you. My
[27:39.960 --> 27:45.300]  email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I'm easy to get a hold of. I'm trying to catch
[27:45.300 --> 27:49.520]  up and answer all of the emails and do episodes about all of them. But I honestly get so many
[27:49.520 --> 27:53.680]  that it's hard to keep up, but I'm getting to your email. A lot of people have asked
[27:53.680 --> 28:00.680]  for episodes about beneficial insects and pest management and identification of problems
[28:00.680 --> 28:04.320]  in the garden. I am working on that. That's going to be a long episode. I may do it in
[28:04.320 --> 28:08.880]  multiple parts. I've got several pages written already. I'm still working on that one. I've
[28:08.880 --> 28:14.240]  got an episode coming up about seasonal effectiveness disorder or seasonal effective disorder. Since
[28:14.240 --> 28:17.920]  it has been winter time here, I want to talk a little bit about that because I've got a
[28:17.920 --> 28:21.780]  bunch of great stuff coming up. A lot of it has been listener inspired material, which
[28:21.780 --> 28:26.340]  I truly enjoy bringing to you. I've been going for 28 minutes. I'm going to wrap up
[28:26.340 --> 28:29.500]  this podcast. I want to thank everybody for listening. Big shout out to my friends at

[28:59.520 --> 29:03.580]  shoot a bunch of them to Instagram about once every two hours or so. Whenever I sit down
[29:03.580 --> 29:07.100]  and take a couple dabs, I try to shoot a new picture up to Instagram. While I edit this

[30:28.620 --> 30:32.540]  I've got for you this week. I was lucky enough to get to see Maddie and Spence for a couple
[30:32.540 --> 30:35.660]  of minutes at the Cannon Canyon the other day. They came to Colorado to visit. They
[30:35.660 --> 30:38.860]  invited me up. I got to hang out and take some dabs and take a picture with Maddie.
[30:39.100 --> 30:42.700]  I sure did miss those guys. So big shout out to Maddie and Spence. And until next time,
[30:42.700 --> 30:45.580]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[32:01.760 --> 32:10.160]  Left my son, I don't know. Don't really care.
[32:13.280 --> 32:19.120]  Let there be songs to fill the air.
[32:19.360 --> 32:38.740]  When still water, when there is no pebble tossed, no wind to blow, reach out your hand.
[32:39.700 --> 32:52.980]  If your cup be empty, if your cup is full, may it be again, let it be known.
[32:54.980 --> 33:05.940]  There is a fountain that was not made by the hands of man.
[33:06.420 --> 33:21.380]  There is a road, no simple highway between the dawn and the dark of night.
[33:21.380 --> 33:36.300]  And if you go, the path is far, your steps alone.
[33:38.540 --> 33:59.580]  When still water, when there is no pebble tossed, no wind to blow, you choose to lead, must follow.
[33:59.740 --> 34:14.540]  But if you fall, you fall alone. If you should stand, then who's to guide you?
[34:17.100 --> 34:22.780]  If I knew the way, I would take you home.
[34:29.580 --> 34:31.580]  If I knew the way, I would take you home.
