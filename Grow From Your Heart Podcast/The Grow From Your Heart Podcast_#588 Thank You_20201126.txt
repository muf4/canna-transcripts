[00:00.440 --> 00:02.960]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.960 --> 00:04.760]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff,
[00:04.760 --> 00:07.120]  and this is episode 588
[00:07.120 --> 00:09.120]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:09.120 --> 00:11.560]  I'm not gonna start this episode with any advertising.
[00:11.560 --> 00:13.320]  We're not gonna talk about what I'm smoking,
[00:13.320 --> 00:16.000]  and there are no Patreon shout-outs to start the show.
[00:16.000 --> 00:20.120]  I wanted to come in and do a quick thank you holiday podcast.
[00:20.120 --> 00:22.320]  That's right, I owe everybody listening to this show
[00:22.320 --> 00:23.960]  a big thank you shout-out.
[00:23.960 --> 00:26.060]  If you've been listening since the very beginning,
[00:26.060 --> 00:27.640]  if you jumped in somewhere in the middle,
[00:27.640 --> 00:30.160]  or even if this is your very first episode,
[00:30.160 --> 00:32.440]  I wanna say thank you for listening to the show
[00:32.440 --> 00:34.080]  and for supporting the show.
[00:34.080 --> 00:36.880]  I also wanna thank everybody who supports iReed Genetics
[00:36.880 --> 00:39.120]  and all things Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.120 --> 00:41.660]  Without your trust and inspiration and support,
[00:41.660 --> 00:43.480]  the podcast and the seed company
[00:43.480 --> 00:45.760]  would not be nearly as successful as they are,
[00:45.760 --> 00:47.920]  so thank you, it does mean a lot to me.
[00:49.100 --> 00:51.860]  Now I also wanna take this opportunity to say thanks
[00:51.860 --> 00:55.280]  for a few things I am thankful for and grateful for.
[00:55.280 --> 00:57.480]  We are obviously living in trying times right now.
[00:57.480 --> 00:59.000]  We are dealing with a pandemic,
[00:59.000 --> 01:01.520]  it has ruined people's health and people's businesses
[01:01.520 --> 01:03.140]  and people's mental wellbeing.
[01:03.140 --> 01:05.480]  So I wanna start by saying that I am very thankful
[01:05.480 --> 01:08.540]  and grateful that this pandemic has not disrupted
[01:08.540 --> 01:10.240]  my business and my health.
[01:10.240 --> 01:13.000]  I am healthy, my company is still thriving,
[01:13.000 --> 01:14.720]  I am very grateful for that.
[01:14.720 --> 01:17.320]  I have watched this pandemic take lives of people,
[01:17.320 --> 01:19.840]  I have watched this pandemic destroy businesses,
[01:19.840 --> 01:23.560]  I've watched this pandemic destroy people financially,
[01:23.560 --> 01:25.320]  physically and emotionally,
[01:25.320 --> 01:27.120]  and I am very thankful and grateful
[01:27.120 --> 01:29.880]  that it hasn't gotten to me this far.
[01:29.880 --> 01:32.160]  I'm a strong person, I've got a lot of support,
[01:32.160 --> 01:33.520]  I've got a good team around me,
[01:33.520 --> 01:34.720]  I think we're gonna make it,
[01:34.720 --> 01:37.160]  but I am very grateful for all of those things
[01:37.160 --> 01:39.760]  and I wanted to express that gratitude.
[01:39.760 --> 01:41.600]  I'm very thankful to be healthy
[01:41.600 --> 01:44.200]  and that my business has survived through this pandemic.
[01:44.200 --> 01:45.800]  So that is a great start.
[01:45.800 --> 01:47.280]  Where else do we go from there?
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.040]  I wanna say that I am very grateful and thankful
[01:50.040 --> 01:52.240]  for what I consider success.
[01:52.240 --> 01:55.080]  At this point in my life, I think I am successful.
[01:55.120 --> 01:58.120]  It has taken me a long time to relax and say,
[01:58.120 --> 01:59.480]  bro, I'm successful.
[01:59.480 --> 02:01.240]  I've done it, I've done something,
[02:01.240 --> 02:03.200]  I can kinda settle down a little bit.
[02:03.200 --> 02:04.760]  I'm not gonna stop, don't get me wrong there,
[02:04.760 --> 02:07.120]  but I feel like I've made a mark in the world
[02:07.120 --> 02:08.120]  and I am successful.
[02:08.120 --> 02:11.360]  I'm proud of who and what I am at this point in life
[02:11.360 --> 02:13.400]  and I watch a lot of people around me
[02:13.400 --> 02:15.680]  and I don't know that everybody can say that.
[02:15.680 --> 02:17.640]  I see people who have reached that point and I say,
[02:17.640 --> 02:19.280]  I always wanted to get to where that guy is
[02:19.280 --> 02:21.720]  or that woman is and I'm fucking there.
[02:21.720 --> 02:23.880]  I'm successful, I'm confident and secure
[02:23.880 --> 02:26.120]  with who and what I am at this point in life
[02:26.120 --> 02:27.600]  and that is an amazing feeling.
[02:27.600 --> 02:30.800]  So I am grateful and thankful for that.
[02:30.800 --> 02:33.600]  Let's talk about a couple other things.
[02:33.600 --> 02:36.400]  I feel like I could pass away today
[02:36.400 --> 02:38.100]  and this company would survive.
[02:38.100 --> 02:39.800]  I could not live tomorrow.
[02:39.800 --> 02:41.880]  I don't wanna think about that, but it's a reality.
[02:41.880 --> 02:42.800]  We all pass away.
[02:42.800 --> 02:45.480]  I could not exist anymore and this company,
[02:45.480 --> 02:47.400]  the seed company and the podcast
[02:47.400 --> 02:49.440]  will thrive for years without me.
[02:49.440 --> 02:51.060]  As long as the internet doesn't go away,
[02:51.060 --> 02:52.960]  as long as YouTube doesn't go away,
[02:52.960 --> 02:55.760]  this podcast will continue to exist.
[02:55.760 --> 02:56.880]  You guys will keep learning.
[02:56.880 --> 02:58.740]  People will be educating themselves
[02:58.740 --> 03:01.060]  through this podcast for years to come.
[03:01.060 --> 03:04.220]  Also, I have put out countless seeds.
[03:04.220 --> 03:06.860]  There are seeds all over the world being grown
[03:06.860 --> 03:09.600]  by people that love, trust and respect my brand.
[03:09.600 --> 03:11.360]  So those seeds will continue to be grown
[03:11.360 --> 03:13.400]  for decades and generations to come.
[03:13.400 --> 03:14.880]  They can make clones from them.
[03:14.880 --> 03:17.440]  Hopefully people breed with them and carry on the name.
[03:17.440 --> 03:20.160]  So I feel, in my opinion, that is success.
[03:20.160 --> 03:22.680]  When my life, my work is going to live on
[03:23.420 --> 03:25.720]  and continue to improve the life of others,
[03:25.720 --> 03:26.920]  I feel like I am successful.
[03:26.920 --> 03:28.680]  I could kinda catch my breath
[03:28.680 --> 03:30.520]  and count my blessings at this time,
[03:30.520 --> 03:32.300]  which is what we are doing here together.
[03:32.300 --> 03:33.520]  Also, I'm not just bragging.
[03:33.520 --> 03:35.240]  It may sound like I'm bragging and coming and saying,
[03:35.240 --> 03:37.440]  hey, I've got a cool podcast, a seed company,
[03:37.440 --> 03:38.320]  I'm killing it.
[03:38.320 --> 03:40.620]  I'm also reminding you to be grateful
[03:40.620 --> 03:42.280]  and thankful for what you have got.
[03:42.280 --> 03:43.400]  We need to share gratitude.
[03:43.400 --> 03:45.040]  We need to express gratitude.
[03:45.040 --> 03:47.900]  Sometimes you need to be reminded of gratitude
[03:47.900 --> 03:49.500]  and the things you're grateful for.
[03:49.500 --> 03:50.580]  You've got your health.
[03:50.580 --> 03:51.760]  You've got your wealth.
[03:51.760 --> 03:52.900]  You may have a little cold.
[03:52.900 --> 03:54.300]  You may have some health problems,
[03:54.300 --> 03:56.220]  but you're fucking living, you're breathing,
[03:56.220 --> 03:57.480]  you got earbuds in your ears
[03:57.480 --> 03:58.920]  and you're listening to this podcast,
[03:58.920 --> 04:01.080]  which means you probably have some sort of a device
[04:01.080 --> 04:02.240]  to watch or listen on,
[04:02.240 --> 04:05.560]  which means your health and your wealth are doing okay.
[04:05.560 --> 04:07.640]  We don't need to be fucking super athletes.
[04:07.640 --> 04:08.840]  We don't need stacks of money.
[04:08.840 --> 04:11.640]  We should be grateful for what we've got and enjoy that.
[04:11.640 --> 04:15.120]  So be grateful and share some gratitude with me.
[04:15.120 --> 04:16.520]  Now, a couple other things I wanna talk about
[04:16.520 --> 04:17.980]  that I'm really grateful for
[04:17.980 --> 04:20.920]  is that my mom and my daughter are safe and healthy.
[04:20.920 --> 04:23.140]  Those are probably two of the most important people
[04:23.140 --> 04:23.980]  in my world.
[04:23.980 --> 04:26.160]  I did lose a couple of very important people to me
[04:26.160 --> 04:27.260]  in the past year.
[04:27.260 --> 04:28.500]  I miss them dearly.
[04:28.500 --> 04:29.340]  Love you guys.
[04:29.340 --> 04:31.240]  Shout out to my uncles who I lost this year,
[04:31.240 --> 04:33.360]  but I'm grateful that my mom and my daughter
[04:33.360 --> 04:34.180]  are still here.
[04:34.180 --> 04:36.120]  Without those two, I'd be a mess.
[04:36.120 --> 04:38.480]  Those are the most important peoples in my world.
[04:38.480 --> 04:40.240]  So shout out to those two.
[04:40.240 --> 04:42.220]  That's a lot of inspiration right there.
[04:42.220 --> 04:43.800]  Now we're gonna kind of segue into things
[04:43.800 --> 04:45.000]  that aren't as heavy.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.800]  I'm fucking grateful and thankful
[04:46.800 --> 04:51.160]  for the fact that we hit 5,000 YouTube subscribers.
[04:51.160 --> 04:52.320]  Thank you guys.
[04:52.320 --> 04:55.240]  5,000, over 5,000 by the time this episode comes out.
[04:55.240 --> 04:57.280]  We're at about 5.1K.
[04:57.280 --> 04:58.880]  It increased rapidly.
[04:58.880 --> 05:00.520]  I am thankful and grateful for that.
[05:00.520 --> 05:01.800]  Another sign of success.
[05:01.800 --> 05:05.080]  Another sign that all of my hard work, my dedication,
[05:05.080 --> 05:07.800]  my commitment are paying off, which shows success,
[05:07.800 --> 05:11.400]  which that success contributes to my health and my wealth.
[05:11.400 --> 05:13.200]  Not just, I say health and wealth.
[05:13.200 --> 05:14.380]  There are a lot of things involving that.
[05:14.380 --> 05:17.540]  My mental health, my physical health, my wellbeing,
[05:17.540 --> 05:19.180]  which means that I'm making an income,
[05:19.180 --> 05:21.220]  which means I can feed myself to eat healthily
[05:21.220 --> 05:22.720]  and feed myself the way I would like to.
[05:22.720 --> 05:24.780]  So all of those tie in together.
[05:24.780 --> 05:27.200]  Thank you for the 5,000 subscribers.
[05:27.200 --> 05:28.040]  That means a lot to me.
[05:28.040 --> 05:31.640]  Also, I wanna say thank you for all of the relationships
[05:31.640 --> 05:34.380]  I have built in the cannabis community.
[05:34.380 --> 05:37.140]  I have made so many friends through Instagram,
[05:37.140 --> 05:39.220]  through Cannabuzz, through Patreon.
[05:39.220 --> 05:40.820]  Extra shout out to the Patreon folks.
[05:40.820 --> 05:42.620]  I made a ton of friends through YouTube.
[05:42.620 --> 05:44.540]  I've made friends on Facebook.
[05:44.540 --> 05:46.460]  I make friends every single day.
[05:46.460 --> 05:48.340]  If it's not online, it's going somewhere.
[05:48.340 --> 05:50.220]  If it's at the growth store, if it's at,
[05:50.220 --> 05:52.260]  sometimes I just meet people at a restaurant randomly.
[05:52.260 --> 05:53.620]  They recognize my voice and they go,
[05:53.620 --> 05:54.860]  hey, you're Rasta Jeff.
[05:54.860 --> 05:57.100]  And I give them an air fist bump from across the room
[05:57.100 --> 05:58.620]  because we're in the pandemic.
[05:58.620 --> 06:01.820]  But I've made many, many great relationships.
[06:01.820 --> 06:03.140]  I've got so many new friends.
[06:03.140 --> 06:04.300]  You guys know who you are.
[06:04.300 --> 06:05.660]  I'm not gonna start giving shout outs
[06:05.660 --> 06:08.140]  because I'll skip somebody and feel like an asshole.
[06:08.140 --> 06:11.180]  But I am so grateful for the team of friends
[06:11.180 --> 06:12.820]  that I have built through this company,
[06:12.820 --> 06:14.300]  through this podcast.
[06:14.300 --> 06:16.980]  Whenever I need technical help, if I need camera help,
[06:16.980 --> 06:18.780]  if I need computer help,
[06:18.780 --> 06:20.580]  I feel like I've got the growth stuff figured out,
[06:20.580 --> 06:23.780]  but I've got friends who are on the level of grow knowledge,
[06:23.780 --> 06:24.620]  which I have.
[06:24.620 --> 06:26.460]  I have friends who have computer knowledge like that.
[06:26.460 --> 06:28.320]  I have friends with camera knowledge like that.
[06:28.320 --> 06:30.300]  I have friends with lighting knowledge like that.
[06:30.300 --> 06:33.220]  So whenever I have questions, I reach out to those folks
[06:33.220 --> 06:35.720]  and they supply me with all of the knowledge that I need.
[06:35.720 --> 06:37.860]  So I'm very grateful to have that team
[06:37.860 --> 06:39.740]  and just the friendship, the camaraderie,
[06:39.740 --> 06:42.300]  the trust, the relationships.
[06:42.300 --> 06:43.540]  There are people from Cannabis
[06:43.540 --> 06:44.940]  that I've never met in person
[06:44.940 --> 06:47.020]  that we have long conversations late at night.
[06:47.020 --> 06:48.140]  I'll be up packaging seeds
[06:48.140 --> 06:49.500]  and I'll just get a little message.
[06:49.500 --> 06:50.580]  It's like, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[06:50.580 --> 06:51.460]  And I'm like, oh, what's up, bro?
[06:51.460 --> 06:53.300]  And we just have funny conversations
[06:53.300 --> 06:54.820]  that best friends who have known each other
[06:54.820 --> 06:56.180]  since high school would have.
[06:56.180 --> 06:57.380]  And we met on Cannabis.
[06:57.380 --> 06:59.780]  And Cannabis has only been an app for like a year.
[06:59.780 --> 07:03.420]  So I'm really grateful for all of these amazing,
[07:03.420 --> 07:06.260]  deep friendships and relationships I have developed
[07:06.260 --> 07:08.140]  through this company, through this podcast,
[07:08.140 --> 07:09.540]  through the cannabis community,
[07:10.340 --> 07:11.180]  through the world.
[07:11.180 --> 07:12.020]  Thank you guys.
[07:12.020 --> 07:13.340]  It means a lot to me.
[07:13.340 --> 07:15.060]  People look up to me.
[07:15.060 --> 07:16.340]  People respect me.
[07:16.340 --> 07:19.460]  I try to stay humble and just be a normal person.
[07:19.460 --> 07:20.940]  I'm just a normal dude.
[07:20.940 --> 07:22.260]  I woke up with eye boogers.
[07:22.260 --> 07:23.860]  I had to pee and I got hungry.
[07:23.860 --> 07:25.540]  My life is just a normal life.
[07:25.540 --> 07:29.900]  And I am very grateful to have such a large friend circle,
[07:29.900 --> 07:33.220]  support team, support group, an audience.
[07:33.220 --> 07:34.480]  I don't like to think of you as my audience.
[07:34.480 --> 07:35.360]  You guys are my friends.
[07:35.360 --> 07:36.580]  You guys are my people.
[07:36.580 --> 07:37.640]  Like I can reach out to you
[07:37.640 --> 07:39.880]  and if I need someone to talk to, you're there.
[07:39.880 --> 07:41.720]  If I need some tech help, you're there.
[07:41.720 --> 07:43.040]  And that shit is priceless.
[07:43.040 --> 07:44.800]  So I don't want to ramble on too long
[07:44.800 --> 07:46.120]  and sound like a, I don't know what it is.
[07:46.120 --> 07:47.000]  I don't want to get all sappy.
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.040]  I promised myself I wasn't going to cry,
[07:49.040 --> 07:50.240]  but I want to thank you guys.
[07:50.240 --> 07:53.640]  Without you, I would just be talking into a camera
[07:53.640 --> 07:55.840]  and this may be a sign of weird mental illness
[07:55.840 --> 07:57.260]  if you guys weren't on the other end of it.
[07:57.260 --> 07:58.600]  So I'm glad you were there.
[07:58.600 --> 08:00.520]  I'd probably be considered a psychopath
[08:00.520 --> 08:02.640]  if I just did this twice a week and nobody listened.
[08:02.640 --> 08:03.480]  So thank you.
[08:03.480 --> 08:04.480]  I appreciate it.
[08:04.480 --> 08:06.040]  I appreciate the support, the trust.
[08:06.040 --> 08:06.940]  I keep saying the same thing,
[08:07.240 --> 08:08.740]  but it does mean a lot to me.
[08:08.740 --> 08:12.580]  I'm also thankful to be here now.
[08:12.580 --> 08:15.300]  I'm very blessed to be this guy
[08:15.300 --> 08:18.120]  in this position in this time.
[08:18.120 --> 08:20.000]  I'm glad to be Rasta Jeff.
[08:20.000 --> 08:20.840]  I'm glad to be Jeff.
[08:20.840 --> 08:22.220]  I'm not Rasta Jeff to everybody.
[08:22.220 --> 08:23.860]  The people around here don't call me Rasta Jeff.
[08:23.860 --> 08:25.000]  They say, hey, you fucker.
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.300]  Or they say dad.
[08:27.300 --> 08:28.460]  And that means a lot to me.
[08:28.460 --> 08:31.260]  I'm fucking grateful to be Rasta Jeff of iRegenetics,
[08:31.260 --> 08:32.240]  but I'm glad to be Jeff.
[08:32.240 --> 08:33.460]  I'm glad to be Maya's dad.
[08:33.460 --> 08:34.700]  I'm glad to be my mom's son.
[08:34.700 --> 08:37.020]  I'm glad to be all of my friend's friends.
[08:37.020 --> 08:39.460]  So the podcast guy, the seed guy,
[08:39.460 --> 08:41.800]  I'm fucking thankful to be that guy.
[08:41.800 --> 08:44.840]  It's taken me several years to be confident
[08:44.840 --> 08:47.540]  and secure and comfortable with exactly who I am.
[08:47.540 --> 08:49.300]  But at this point, this is me
[08:49.300 --> 08:51.600]  and I've never been more comfortable,
[08:51.600 --> 08:53.880]  proud, secure, confident of what I am
[08:53.880 --> 08:55.420]  and what I've got to offer.
[08:55.420 --> 08:57.120]  And a lot of it is because of the feedback
[08:57.120 --> 08:58.200]  that I've gotten from you guys.
[08:58.200 --> 09:01.960]  So from the bottom of my heart, the top of my lungs,
[09:01.960 --> 09:03.220]  fucking thank you guys.
[09:03.220 --> 09:04.320]  I love you.
[09:04.840 --> 09:06.480]  And I'm gonna let you guys get back to your family.
[09:06.480 --> 09:07.840]  Go spread some gratitude.
[09:07.840 --> 09:09.060]  Go tell somebody thank you.
[09:09.060 --> 09:10.160]  Tell somebody you love them.
[09:10.160 --> 09:12.400]  Spread the vibe that I have given you just now.
[09:12.400 --> 09:14.960]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[09:14.960 --> 09:16.520]  and give your mom a hug for me.
