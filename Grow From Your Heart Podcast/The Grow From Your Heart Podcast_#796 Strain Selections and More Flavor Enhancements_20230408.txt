[00:03.070 --> 00:26.890]  Alright, now here we go, welcome to the show podcast world, I'm your host Rasta Jeff, this
[00:26.890 --> 00:32.410]  of course is episode 796 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:32.410 --> 00:35.930]  In this episode I'm going to give away free seeds, that's right I've teamed up with our
[00:35.930 --> 00:41.250]  friends at seedsherenow.com to give away a free pack of iRe genetic seeds, hang out we'll
[00:41.250 --> 00:43.810]  talk more about that later in this episode.
[00:43.810 --> 00:48.530]  Before we get too far I do want to announce that I was on the Dude Grows show recently,
[00:48.530 --> 00:52.550]  by the time this episode comes out that Dude Grows show episode will be out and available

[01:22.490 --> 01:27.130]  to seeing you at the Dude Grows cup, that's right I will be there, team iRe genetics will
[01:27.130 --> 01:31.010]  be there, we'll have a booth, we'll have all kinds of great seeds, we'll have a good time,
[01:31.010 --> 01:35.810]  come say hi, even if you're not shopping for seeds, come by, say hi, give me a fist bump,
[01:36.530 --> 01:40.210]  give me a hug, take a photo with me if that's what you're into, you don't have to buy seeds
[01:40.210 --> 01:44.410]  to come hang out, I invite everybody to come say hi, also if you're looking for seeds,
[01:44.410 --> 01:46.410]  definitely make sure you come by the booth.
[01:46.410 --> 01:49.250]  Alright I think that's all of the business we've got, nope there's one more thing to
[01:49.250 --> 01:54.770]  cover, more business here at the start of the show, there is a sale running on iRedirect.com,

[02:14.410 --> 02:18.530]  those Fem seeds, get your garden started, set yourself up for success.
[02:18.530 --> 02:22.610]  Alright now we are through all of the business part of the podcast, it is time to jump into
[02:22.610 --> 02:27.930]  the email and grow question portion of today's show, the first question comes from the grow
[02:27.930 --> 02:34.070]  help tab on the iRe genetics website, if you go to iRegenetics.com there's a list of tabs
[02:34.070 --> 02:38.470]  at the top, one of them does say questions or grow help, you'll find it, I'm sure you're
[02:38.470 --> 02:42.390]  smart enough, give that a click, it will ask you a few questions, it asks you about your
[02:42.390 --> 02:46.190]  grow space, it's going to ask you if you're growing indoors, outdoors, what strain are
[02:46.190 --> 02:50.630]  you growing, what's the temp, what's the humidity, we ask a few basic questions, we want to know
[02:50.630 --> 02:54.390]  what's going on, that lets me get a heads up on how to help you, the more I know about
[02:54.390 --> 02:58.830]  your grow, the easier it is for me to diagnose, correct and set you up for success and help
[02:58.830 --> 03:02.610]  you with your grow, so we ask some questions, go to the grow help tab, after those general
[03:02.610 --> 03:06.650]  questions we do give you the opportunity to type in your full question, what's going
[03:06.650 --> 03:11.730]  on in the grow, how can we help you, my friend JH has sent me a question on the grow help
[03:11.730 --> 03:18.030]  tab and it goes a little bit like this, hey Ross to Jeff, can you tell me about your easiest
[03:18.030 --> 03:23.330]  to grow strains, something I can really hit out of the park without being an expert, then
[03:23.330 --> 03:27.370]  he goes in parenthesis and says, and don't say all of them, that's really funny because
[03:27.370 --> 03:30.690]  all of my strains are pretty easy to grow and you should be able to bang them all out
[03:30.690 --> 03:35.290]  of the park, but I will give you some specifics and some more details, it says what one of
[03:35.290 --> 03:40.090]  your strains is the healthiest, which strain can't and won't be stopped, which strain is
[03:40.090 --> 03:45.570]  beginner friendly and what strain is resistant to all, then they ask follow up questions,
[03:45.570 --> 03:49.090]  once I determine all the answers for these, they want to know what does it smell like,
[03:49.090 --> 03:53.290]  what is the flowering time and what type of morphology can we expect and then are there
[03:53.290 --> 03:56.930]  more on the list, then he follows up with another great question, let's jump into the
[03:56.930 --> 04:01.330]  first part of this question here from our friend JH in Canada, the main part of the
[04:01.330 --> 04:05.930]  question is which of my strains are easiest to grow and then he said don't say all of
[04:05.930 --> 04:12.530]  them, so that does limit me, I often say that Sunkiss is one of my easiest to grow strains,
[04:12.530 --> 04:16.970]  Sunkiss is super easy, it's very forgiving, if you make a mistake, if you over water,
[04:16.970 --> 04:21.410]  under water, over feed, under feed, the Sunkiss doesn't get too upset about that, it can take
[04:21.410 --> 04:25.530]  some abuse, it can take some grower error and a new grower is going to make some errors
[04:25.530 --> 04:30.330]  and cause some abuse, so Sunkiss is always one of my very first recommendations when
[04:30.330 --> 04:36.570]  it comes to successful plants for a beginner grower, I also recommend the Strawberry Starburst,
[04:36.570 --> 04:40.770]  the only issue with Strawberry Starburst is it may get a little bit tall for a new grower
[04:40.770 --> 04:45.290]  if they are not prepared, the good side to that is it does grow super quickly in veg,
[04:45.290 --> 04:49.290]  it grows with hyper vigor in veg, so it doesn't take nearly as much flowering time to get
[04:49.290 --> 04:53.130]  that plant big enough and ready for flower because it just grows so quickly, so your
[04:53.130 --> 04:57.490]  veg time is shorter which gives you less time for problems, I feel like the quicker
[04:57.490 --> 05:01.690]  in and out we are in that grow in that garden, the less opportunity we have for problems,
[05:01.690 --> 05:05.410]  so a quicker vegging plant will definitely help you out, however those will get quite
[05:05.410 --> 05:09.330]  tall, just flip early, you will be okay, I do have a longer list here of things that
[05:09.330 --> 05:14.730]  I think will grow well in your garden from my lineup, I always recommend Morning Dew,
[05:14.730 --> 05:19.490]  Morning Dew is a great cross, it's very resistant to powdery mildew, very resistant to bud rot,
[05:19.490 --> 05:24.370]  it grows very well, it's got a great structure and it's super stinky and super potent product
[05:24.370 --> 05:29.630]  in the end, so the Sun Kiss, Strawberry Starburst and Morning Dew are three of the classics
[05:29.630 --> 05:32.630]  that I would recommend, those have been in my lineup for quite a while, they have been
[05:32.630 --> 05:37.650]  tried and true, we know they work well in all types of environments, indoors, outdoors,
[05:37.650 --> 05:41.930]  greenhouses, they work well for experienced growers and they definitely work well for
[05:41.930 --> 05:46.450]  the noobs, I have seen new growers push that Strawberry Starburst to beautiful limits,
[05:46.450 --> 05:50.410]  I have seen some gorgeous pictures of Strawberry Starburst, the Morning Dew comes out super
[05:50.410 --> 05:55.890]  frosty, super chunky no matter who grows it and the Sun Kiss is just autopilot weed, if
[05:55.890 --> 05:59.530]  you pour water and nutrients on that and put lights above it, Sun Kiss is going to give
[05:59.530 --> 06:04.170]  you excellent, amazing top shelf buds, so let's keep going because there are more to
[06:04.170 --> 06:08.650]  the list, I want to mention Fist Bump, Fist Bump is one of my newer strains, Fist Bump
[06:08.650 --> 06:14.090]  is super easy to grow, it is a sour diesel to a rise cross, once again the only problem
[06:14.090 --> 06:18.330]  you may run into with Fist Bump is it is going to get fairly tall, fairly quickly and
[06:18.330 --> 06:23.170]  it may need some sort of supports but it is pretty easy to grow in most cases.
[06:23.170 --> 06:27.610]  Now let's make it real easy for people and let's talk about some feminized lines that
[06:27.610 --> 06:32.610]  I do offer that make it very easy for people to grow, one of my favorites that I recommend
[06:32.610 --> 06:36.430]  for new growers that you guys love, that everybody out there is able to grow, able to knock it
[06:36.430 --> 06:41.130]  out of the park is Golden Goat, Golden Goat is really easy to grow, it needs a little
[06:41.130 --> 06:46.730]  extra feeding but most new growers tend to overfeed anyway, so since the Golden Goat
[06:46.730 --> 06:50.650]  needs a little extra nutrients, you guys do it just right, the new growers do that one
[06:50.650 --> 06:52.330]  very well.
[06:52.330 --> 06:56.370]  Golden Goat is a feminized seed, if you get seeds from me, if it says Fem Seeds on it,
[06:56.370 --> 07:00.610]  there is a Golden Goat back cross, those are not Fems, however there are Golden Goat feminized
[07:00.610 --> 07:04.570]  seeds available, you will have all female plants in your lineup, they will grow with
[07:04.570 --> 07:09.010]  great vigor, they will be nice and sturdy, they make beautiful plants with great colors,
[07:09.010 --> 07:13.730]  great aromas, they take about 8.5 to 9.5 weeks to finish depending on the room and
[07:13.730 --> 07:17.650]  the phenotypical expressions you achieve, which plants you get out of the seed pack
[07:17.650 --> 07:22.130]  basically, but it's really easy to grow and the buzz from Golden Goat is amazing, the
[07:22.130 --> 07:26.370]  flavors, aromas and buzz are top shelf, that's why I breed it to everything, you'll notice
[07:26.370 --> 07:29.890]  there's Golden Goat somewhere in a lot of my crosses.
[07:29.890 --> 07:35.570]  Let's keep going, more feminized stuff, the maize and the wombat, maize and wombat are
[07:35.570 --> 07:40.090]  great strains for new growers, they will work very well for you, also Character Zero
[07:40.090 --> 07:44.890]  and Sunday Show will be great strains for new growers, those are all four of those are
[07:44.890 --> 07:50.370]  feminized, there's maize, wombat, Sunday Show and Character Zero, those are all Fems, they
[07:50.370 --> 07:54.570]  will all grow very well for a new grower, they're all very resistant to problems, the
[07:54.570 --> 07:59.450]  mildew, the mold, bugs, all of those will be very resistant, the problem with those
[07:59.450 --> 08:03.610]  last four that I mentioned is they do get a little bit tall, that's the only issue to
[08:03.610 --> 08:08.410]  worry about, the thing to do there, flower early, don't veg them for so long, which most
[08:08.410 --> 08:13.130]  growers are pretty eager to get the crop going, they do want to flower early, so veg them
[08:13.130 --> 08:17.090]  till they're about maybe knee high, then flip them and I think you'll do really well with
[08:17.090 --> 08:22.730]  those plants, so let me review that list, regular seeds, Sun Kiss, Strawberry Starburst,
[08:22.730 --> 08:27.690]  Morning Dew, then we work into Fist Bump, Fist Bump is going to be super stinky, make
[08:27.690 --> 08:32.210]  sure you have carbon filtration in place for the Fist Bump, then feminized, Golden Goat
[08:32.210 --> 08:39.210]  is super easy to grow, maize, wombat, Character Zero and Sunday Show are very easy to grow,
[08:39.210 --> 08:44.170]  another great growing plant is the Lemon Jeffery, however it does get really tall and it's kind
[08:44.170 --> 08:48.690]  of picky on feeding in some phenotypes, so if you want to really push yourself, try the
[08:48.690 --> 08:53.130]  Lemon Jeff, but that's a next step up, that one's not going to be as easy, so those are
[08:53.130 --> 08:58.010]  some of my easiest and healthiest to grow, those can't stop, won't be stopped, they're
[08:58.010 --> 09:02.030]  all beginner friendly and they're all quite resistant to most of the problems you're going
[09:02.030 --> 09:05.910]  to run into as a grower, now let's talk about some of the flavors and aromas of a lot of
[09:05.910 --> 09:11.830]  these plants, Sun Kiss, that is straight up oranges, if you're looking for oranges, orange
[09:11.830 --> 09:18.830]  candy, orange funk, Sun Kiss is the way to go, Morning Dew is straight funky, skunky,
[09:18.830 --> 09:23.710]  earthy, I call it warmer notes, those are more earthy, skunky, gassier, darker sort
[09:23.710 --> 09:29.190]  of tones in my mind, the Strawberry Starburst, that's just straight up strawberry candy,
[09:29.310 --> 09:35.590]  Mist Bump, that's going to be fuely, offensive gas, funky, diesel fuel, gasoline sort of
[09:35.590 --> 09:40.430]  turps, Golden Goat, that one's very unique, the Golden Goat is kind of like a tropical
[09:40.430 --> 09:47.430]  fruit basket and juicy fruit bubble gum, that is my opinion of Golden Goat and I love it,
[09:47.430 --> 09:53.590]  Maize, Maize is blue raspberry truffle to the afterglow, so you get that blue raspberry
[09:53.630 --> 10:00.630]  truffle sort of, it's like a raspberry sort of thing, it's a sour, tangy sort of a thing,
[10:01.150 --> 10:05.150]  but then that mixes in with the sweetness of the afterglow and it makes amazing flavors,
[10:05.150 --> 10:09.750]  Wombat, that's the New York City diesel to afterglow, you get hints of that diesel flavor
[10:09.750 --> 10:13.590]  and a lot of orange diesel-y turps out of that one, Character Zero, that one's going
[10:13.590 --> 10:19.470]  to give you those earthy, turpy, more earthy, turpy sort of stuff and then the Sunday Show,
[10:19.470 --> 10:23.870]  that's also going to give you cushy, orange sort of flavors, so those are the flavors
[10:23.870 --> 10:30.190]  and aromas from those, Flowering Time, Sun Kiss, 8 or 9 weeks, Morning Dew, 8 or 9 weeks,
[10:30.190 --> 10:37.190]  Fist Bump, 9 or 10 weeks, Strawberry Starburst, 9 to 10 weeks on that one, Golden Goat, 9
[10:37.390 --> 10:42.830]  weeks, Maize, Wombat, Character Zero, Sunday Show, those are all going to be 9 to 10 weekers,
[10:42.830 --> 10:46.510]  you will find some early finishers in the Sun Kiss and Morning Dew, some of those will
[10:46.510 --> 10:51.390]  go 8 weeks, 56 days, finish the 8th week, you guys, don't cut it down the middle of
[10:51.390 --> 10:56.030]  week 8, let 56 days happen, I would recommend 60 days but some of those are a little bit
[10:56.030 --> 11:02.270]  earlier, Morphology, so since a lot of these came from the Arise pollen donor, King Solomon,
[11:02.270 --> 11:08.470]  a lot of them have that tall, branchy, take off sort of structure, the one that doesn't
[11:08.470 --> 11:13.910]  do it as much is Sun Kiss, Sun Kiss doesn't take off as hard as the others but most of
[11:13.910 --> 11:20.710]  them will get a tall, skinny sort of a structure, Golden Goat is an S1, that one should say,
[11:20.710 --> 11:24.150]  depending on your light and your environment, sometimes it stays a little bit shorter, sometimes
[11:24.150 --> 11:28.150]  it does a little stretching for people but it's shorter and bushier for the Golden Goat,
[11:28.150 --> 11:32.870]  Maize, Wombat, Character Zero and Sunday Show, those are going to get tall on you, you're
[11:32.870 --> 11:37.030]  going to see tall, stretchy plants with a lot of branches but in Flower, all of that
[11:37.030 --> 11:43.110]  tallness just fills up with meaty, beefy, chunky, trichome covered nuggets. I'm not
[11:43.110 --> 11:46.950]  really going to dig too deep into the specific phenotypes of all of these plants, I gave
[11:46.950 --> 11:52.870]  you the basic what to expect, that's a lot to talk about. Second best, that is the one,
[11:52.870 --> 11:55.990]  two, that's like the top ten in my lineup right there, I couldn't pick just one, that's
[11:55.990 --> 11:59.350]  like trying to pick your favorite pair of sneakers but those are a few that I would
[11:59.350 --> 12:03.270]  recommend for a new beginner, I think you'd really kick some good ass with Morning Dew,
[12:03.270 --> 12:08.310]  Fist Bump, everything on that list is great to grow. Then it said, are all of your strains
[12:08.710 --> 12:12.470]  potent? That is a very good question, is everything that I breed potent?
[12:13.670 --> 12:18.710]  Since I'm using, I do very careful selection for male plants, since I'm using top quality
[12:18.710 --> 12:24.790]  male plants, that leads me to think that most of the progeny should be quite potent, it
[12:24.790 --> 12:30.150]  should contain a lot of THC potential but that's also up to the grower, the environment,
[12:30.710 --> 12:35.030]  which phenotype did you select? There may be other terpenes or cannabinoids dominating
[12:35.030 --> 12:41.270]  that mix to where the THC isn't the most potent, most prevalent compound in that plant
[12:41.270 --> 12:45.030]  but it'll still be a very potent plant, so it depends on what you're looking for, it
[12:45.030 --> 12:49.430]  depends on also how did you grow it, where did you grow it, how long did you grow it,
[12:49.430 --> 12:53.430]  then there are a lot of other things that come into play, was it dried and cured properly,
[12:53.430 --> 12:58.150]  is it the strain for you? But yes, in most cases, the things that I bred, the things
[12:58.150 --> 13:02.310]  that I breed and create should be quite potent because I'm smoking for more of a head buzz,
[13:02.310 --> 13:06.390]  I want to walk into the store and almost have a panic attack and think, oh shit, I'm way too
[13:06.390 --> 13:11.350]  high to be in here shopping and consider leaving, that is the buzz that I am seeking to achieve,
[13:11.350 --> 13:16.150]  so I do breed for that sort of head buzz, sort of panicky sort of stuff, there will be some more
[13:16.150 --> 13:20.870]  uh some more cushy variety stuff coming from me in the future here because I miss those old school
[13:20.870 --> 13:26.470]  cushy skunk flavors but I've already said too much, but yes, everything is quite potent.
[13:26.470 --> 13:31.030]  You wrap the message up with, from your friend JH in Canada, JH my dude, thank you for the
[13:31.030 --> 13:35.350]  great message, of course I do owe you a free pack of seeds, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

[13:55.670 --> 14:00.230]  I do have another message here in front of me, this one is kind of a follow-up, this one is from
[14:00.230 --> 14:05.590]  JH again, I know I'm spoiling JH but these two questions came back to back and this one was super
[14:05.590 --> 14:12.790]  easy to answer, it says, hey Ross to Jeff, JH here again, if I like the flavor of one of your 20% THC
[14:12.790 --> 14:21.590]  crosses more than one of your 30% THC crosses, should I go with the flavor? Yes, we often teach
[14:21.590 --> 14:26.950]  people here in Colorado that the THC number isn't the ultimate deciding factor in how good a product
[14:26.950 --> 14:33.590]  is, THC percentage in a plant is what a lab detected, sometimes you may find that they're,
[14:33.590 --> 14:37.670]  like I said a moment ago, there are better terpenes, maybe there's better esters, paleoids,
[14:37.670 --> 14:41.910]  flavonoids, there's a lot of other things in this plant that affect the way we consume it and the
[14:41.910 --> 14:48.710]  way we enjoy it, if you've got a 30% THC plant with zero terps, I might not enjoy it as much as
[14:48.710 --> 14:54.470]  I would a 20% THC plant with 0.4 terps in there, just that little bit of terps is going to make a
[14:54.470 --> 14:58.630]  big difference and make it taste good, would you rather eat cardboard or would you rather eat
[14:58.630 --> 15:02.550]  cardboard that tastes like strawberries and candy, that's what I'm talking about, do you want some
[15:02.550 --> 15:07.750]  good flavor in the mouth or do you just want blandness, so the nose always knows, follow your
[15:07.750 --> 15:13.110]  nose, I've done a podcast called follow your nose, those terps are super important, so the short
[15:13.110 --> 15:18.870]  answer, if you like one better, smoke the one you like better bro and then I'm going to wrap that
[15:18.870 --> 15:25.830]  up and follow up by saying we are often fooled, bamboozled if you will, by just THC labeling on
[15:25.830 --> 15:31.110]  jars, when you go to the dispensary, when you go to buy seeds, everybody puts a potential THC number
[15:31.110 --> 15:35.910]  or a lab tested THC number on the product, if you look at the dispensary, the jar says whatever
[15:35.910 --> 15:40.710]  banana kush, however much an ounce, however much a gram, whatever, they list the price on the jar a
[15:40.710 --> 15:47.350]  lot of times and then it'll have a big star on it, 27% THC and I watch people scan the shelf and they
[15:47.350 --> 15:52.390]  go, oh a 32, I want that one, I'll take an ounce of that one and sometimes that may not be the best
[15:52.390 --> 15:56.950]  product for you, I give them a smell because I believe that the nose is what matters the most,
[15:56.950 --> 16:02.390]  my nose is going to know if there's something in there that I am lacking or would enjoy, my nose
[16:02.390 --> 16:08.550]  goes, no that's not the one, no, oh that one, when your nose lights up and your eyes go, damn, that's
[16:08.550 --> 16:12.790]  the jar you should buy, that's the weed that you should smoke, the lab test is cool, it gives you
[16:12.790 --> 16:17.350]  kind of a good idea of how potent it could and potentially should be but the other compounds in
[16:17.350 --> 16:22.150]  there are greatly going to affect your buzz, I describe it like this, I haven't said this on
[16:22.150 --> 16:27.670]  the podcast in a long time, we got a lot of new subscribers, let's talk about it this way, I think
[16:27.670 --> 16:33.670]  that THC, let's compare our buzz to a firework, all right, we all love fireworks out there,
[16:33.670 --> 16:36.950]  maybe some of you don't but most of us love fireworks, we all know what they are so this
[16:36.950 --> 16:42.870]  will work, let's just say that the THC is how high up into the air your firework will go, so
[16:42.870 --> 16:46.790]  you're going to smoke THC, your firework is going to shoot up into the air, it's going to go straight
[16:46.790 --> 16:52.870]  up, now my analogy is that the terpenes are the colors of that firework, once that firework gets
[16:52.870 --> 16:57.670]  up into the air, it's going to explode, is it going to put off a purple ring, is it going to put off
[16:57.670 --> 17:02.150]  red, yellow and green sparkles, is it going to be the one that just goes and all the weird shit
[17:02.150 --> 17:07.270]  rains from the sky after it, is it going to be super fucking loud and fly up into the air and go
[17:07.270 --> 17:12.070]  boom and then just put off one big bright white ball of light for a second, is it going to be
[17:12.070 --> 17:16.230]  fucking orange, is it going to be purple, is it going to be green, is it going to be a lot of it,
[17:16.230 --> 17:22.070]  that's what the terpenes decide when we get our buzz, the THC makes us go up, the terpenes decide
[17:22.070 --> 17:26.950]  do we get the munchies, do we get paranoid, do we get the giggles, do you get a little turned on,
[17:26.950 --> 17:31.590]  do you get fucking scared of life, do you get super introspective, do you just get really weird
[17:31.590 --> 17:36.390]  completely weird altogether, that's the terpenes mixing with the other compounds deciding what kind
[17:36.390 --> 17:41.830]  of buzz you get, so I think that shopping just for THC and focusing just on numbers like that
[17:41.830 --> 17:47.510]  can be very misleading and then my wrap-up statement for all this talk about THC percentages
[17:47.510 --> 17:52.870]  and potency is I've had a lot of weed tested in labs and I've had a lot of it come back really
[17:52.870 --> 17:57.590]  high in lab results but you know what I've never had, I've never had a machine come back to buy
[17:57.590 --> 18:02.310]  another bag of weed, so those numbers don't do me any good, those are good numbers for the machine
[18:02.310 --> 18:08.870]  but they're not perfect numbers for humans, humans need other compounds to enjoy our product properly.
[18:08.870 --> 18:12.790]  All right my buddy JH, you only get one free pack of seeds bro but I did double up and read two
[18:12.790 --> 18:18.390]  messages, bro thank you for all the correspondence, the communication, I do like your ideas, I can't
[18:18.390 --> 18:23.750]  respond to every email that you send me bro, there are a lot of them but I do agree with most of what
[18:23.750 --> 18:29.030]  you're saying and I do appreciate your insight and your education, you teach me something
[18:29.030 --> 18:33.110]  sometimes that I'd never thought about, you think in a different way than me, so big up to my buddy
[18:33.110 --> 18:38.230]  JH up there in Canada, send me your address bro, I do owe you a pack of seeds, most of the time you
[18:38.230 --> 18:44.390]  guys I try not to send free seeds to Canada because it does cost me 40 dollars, 40 US dollars in
[18:44.390 --> 18:49.110]  shipping to pack up some seeds and send them to Canada but JH has been around for a long time,
[18:49.110 --> 18:53.670]  he's been participating for a while, we're gonna do that, if you sent me your messages and I have
[18:53.670 --> 18:57.990]  read it and you're in Canada, don't worry I will send you the seeds but I will try to limit the
[18:57.990 --> 19:03.430]  amount of Canadian messages I do read because 40 bucks a pop does add up quite quickly but
[19:03.430 --> 19:09.430]  shout out to our friends at seedsherenow.com for sponsoring a free seed giveaway. All right let's
[19:09.430 --> 19:13.030]  keep moving, I do have another great question here in front of me, once again this did come from the
[19:13.030 --> 19:19.350]  grow help tab on iReed genetics, this one came from our friend who wants to be called striker can
[19:19.350 --> 19:23.110]  and it says what kind of question do you have, there's a problem in the garden, they're growing
[19:23.110 --> 19:27.990]  strawberry starburst, strawberry bubblegum and wedding cake, that's a great lineup, they're
[19:27.990 --> 19:35.270]  indoors under leds, they're in week five of flower, they're growing in cocoa, the ph was 5.5, the ec was
[19:35.270 --> 19:43.110]  300, the daytime temp is 73, nighttime temperature is 65, the humidity is 65, things are looking good,
[19:43.110 --> 19:48.710]  then we get to the question part of this message, it says yo Rasta Jeff I'm wondering what the best
[19:48.710 --> 19:55.990]  thing to add to cocoa for a sweetener taste, taste enhancer, terpene adder could be, I just ordered
[19:55.990 --> 20:00.150]  bud candy from advanced nutrients, that product will work however it is not my favorite,
[20:00.150 --> 20:06.230]  I don't like to bash products on here but honestly here's the truth, when I grew with advanced
[20:06.230 --> 20:11.350]  nutrients products I felt like all of my flowers tasted the same, I could have og cushion one part
[20:11.350 --> 20:15.350]  of the room, strawberry haze in the other, blueberry cookies in the other part of the room,
[20:15.350 --> 20:20.070]  feed them all advanced nutrients, guess what, they all taste like advanced nutrients, it all has that
[20:20.070 --> 20:24.070]  really, once you grow and smoke it a little bit you'll start to recognize the flavor, you'll be in
[20:24.070 --> 20:28.150]  smoke circles, you'll hit a joint, you'll hit a bowl and you'll go ah an advanced nutrients grower,
[20:28.150 --> 20:32.790]  you'll start to taste it, so there's in my opinion it all tastes the same, otherwise there's nothing
[20:32.790 --> 20:37.110]  wrong with that brand, it just doesn't, it all tastes the same and I breed weed to taste really
[20:37.110 --> 20:41.590]  unique and then when it all tastes like the same bud candy to me I don't enjoy that, let's keep
[20:41.590 --> 20:47.990]  moving, it says I do already add tiger bloom booster and ocean marine cuisine, that ocean marine
[20:47.990 --> 20:52.150]  will definitely help you out enhancing the turps and the health of the plants, said I'm drying for
[20:52.150 --> 20:58.070]  about 10 days, the first four days at 50 percent RH, then the rest down to 40, I may stay at the 50
[20:58.070 --> 21:03.030]  for a little longer but that's all right do your thing, says I use a dehumidifier on low with added
[21:03.030 --> 21:07.750]  ventilation in a 5x7 closet, so you're making the best with what you've got, that's great,
[21:08.070 --> 21:12.710]  I just got the lemon Jeffrey as well, so I really want to bring out that sweet citrus smell and
[21:12.710 --> 21:17.750]  flavor, thank you for any advice, rusted Jeff, my dude thank you for the great question, let's jump
[21:17.750 --> 21:22.790]  into this, let's talk about how to enhance flavor a little bit in these sweeter strains, in previous
[21:22.790 --> 21:28.950]  episodes I did talk about adding kelp products to make things taste that up, to enhance that skunky
[21:28.950 --> 21:35.030]  earthy funky cushy aroma and flavor, I think the kelp really brings that out, that will also bring
[21:35.030 --> 21:39.990]  out the aroma and flavors in most of your other strains, it's just not going to be, I feel like it
[21:39.990 --> 21:44.390]  kind of it helps more with the cushy stuff but it will help with your other products, let's talk
[21:44.390 --> 21:49.350]  about more specific products that are available, I don't use a lot of terpene enhancer products,
[21:49.350 --> 21:54.070]  I kind of just try to grow an overall healthy plant with a good balanced diet and a good
[21:54.070 --> 21:58.950]  environment and then dry it and cure it properly and select good genetics but if you want products
[21:58.950 --> 22:03.830]  that you can add, there is a product called terpenator, I have not used terpenator myself
[22:03.830 --> 22:08.950]  but I have heard good reports and good results from the product terpenator and it's expensive
[22:08.950 --> 22:14.790]  so that shit better work, there's also a product called sweet from botanicare, they offer a couple
[22:14.790 --> 22:19.910]  of different flavors, these are exactly what you're asking for, these are sweetener products
[22:19.910 --> 22:24.310]  to add to your nutrient mix and they claim that these products will sweeten up the flavor
[22:24.310 --> 22:29.430]  of your end product, I've never used the sweetener product with the flavor, I've used the
[22:29.430 --> 22:34.230]  sweetener without flavors to work on sugars and carbohydrates in the plants and those plants did
[22:34.230 --> 22:40.150]  come out quite tasty, another product I could recommend is humble honey, humble honey is great
[22:40.150 --> 22:44.950]  shit, I used to use humble honey way back in the day before I made the switch to the new millennium,
[22:44.950 --> 22:49.750]  maybe after thinking about this myself, I might start adding that back into the mix, the humble
[22:49.750 --> 22:54.470]  honey had a lot of different things in there and it definitely made a difference in the flavor
[22:54.470 --> 23:01.510]  and aroma of my product, once again I did mention kelp, now let's talk about just basic things
[23:01.510 --> 23:06.150]  instead of recommending products, once again those companies do not pay me, I'm not advertising, I'm
[23:06.150 --> 23:10.630]  just saying shit that I've used and shit that I've read and seen work, I've not given any money by any
[23:10.630 --> 23:16.950]  of these companies, sugars and carbs are definitely going to help increase the flavor of your cannabis
[23:16.950 --> 23:22.230]  plants, carbonaria is a great product from new millennium that I would definitely recommend
[23:22.230 --> 23:26.710]  adding to your product, don't overfeed the carbonaria, especially if you're in a hydroponic
[23:26.710 --> 23:31.670]  system, that carbonaria will gum up the works, it will suck, if you're using a hydro system I may
[23:31.670 --> 23:36.950]  choose a different product, carbo load from advanced nutrients is actually a pretty decent product,
[23:37.830 --> 23:41.750]  then to all of that stuff if you're using the turpenator, the sweet, the humble honey, don't use
[23:41.750 --> 23:47.430]  all those together, pick one, the carbonaria and the carbo load, also to that I would add bud swell,
[23:47.430 --> 23:51.990]  that is a liquid bat guano product, it'll make your plants go shebang in multiple ways, they'll
[23:51.990 --> 23:56.550]  get beefier and fatter and they will taste and smell good because of that product, I do believe
[23:56.550 --> 24:01.990]  in my opinion, now I'm going to say something that may be controversial because this is not how I
[24:01.990 --> 24:08.390]  grow but sometimes organics will bring out the most amazing flavors in your plants, it's all
[24:08.390 --> 24:13.190]  about the plant and the phenotype, some plants, so let's talk about a couple of things, I've got a
[24:13.190 --> 24:19.590]  sour diesel that grows okay in soilless mix, it does okay, it doesn't have the flavor and aroma
[24:19.590 --> 24:24.150]  that I can achieve when my friend grows it in hydro, I've got a friend that grows the same cut
[24:24.150 --> 24:29.190]  in a hydro bucket and a hydro system and that shit comes out so stinky that it makes my eyes feel
[24:29.190 --> 24:34.390]  weird, I've got to put it in multiple baggies and that's just the difference in how he is growing it,
[24:34.390 --> 24:39.030]  so maybe some phenotypes will make a difference if you grow in hydro soilless mix with bottled
[24:39.030 --> 24:43.990]  nutrients and maybe some plants will benefit from growing it strictly organically, so we got
[24:43.990 --> 24:48.710]  different options, we got to figure out what the plant likes or you've got to find the phenotype
[24:48.710 --> 24:53.270]  that works best with your grow environment, that's why I talk a lot about you selecting the
[24:53.270 --> 24:57.910]  phenotype that works best for you instead of asking me my favorite phenotype, my favorite
[24:57.910 --> 25:03.270]  might not work well in your grow, it probably gets too tall too fast for your grow environment,
[25:03.270 --> 25:07.110]  so growing the right genetics in the right environment with the right system will definitely
[25:07.110 --> 25:12.550]  help you enhance the flavor and aroma, genetics are very important, some plants just don't have
[25:12.550 --> 25:17.110]  a lot of flavor and aroma, maybe some plants have got the wrong flavor and aroma for you,
[25:17.110 --> 25:21.910]  so it's all about finding again the correct genetics for to meet your goals, they meet your
[25:21.910 --> 25:27.750]  needs flavor and aroma wise and also grow well in your system, you've got to find that and then dial
[25:27.750 --> 25:33.110]  that in and perfect that flavor, so also another thing that can definitely affect the flavor and
[25:33.110 --> 25:39.430]  aroma of our plants is the dry and cure process, we can grow these plants perfectly for seven,
[25:39.430 --> 25:44.310]  eight weeks in veg, nine or ten weeks in flour and then once we cut them down we can really
[25:44.310 --> 25:49.350]  destroy these plants, I've seen a lot of people mess up huge beautiful harvests just by not drying
[25:49.350 --> 25:54.070]  and curing them properly, something else I should mention is that there is not really one magic
[25:54.070 --> 25:58.630]  bullet to making our cannabis perfect, we have to get everything right, this is like a giant chess
[25:58.630 --> 26:03.190]  board and everything on the chess board has to be in place if you want to get that checkmate,
[26:03.190 --> 26:09.110]  so don't rely on just one bottle, one product, one trick, one silver bullet to make our product
[26:09.110 --> 26:13.190]  top shelf, everything has to be in line, we need to start with the right light, if you don't have
[26:13.190 --> 26:18.070]  the right light, the right spectrum, the right intensity, the right duration, then nothing will
[26:18.070 --> 26:23.350]  work at all, then we need good air, how is the VPD in the room, is the temperature right, is the
[26:23.350 --> 26:28.230]  humidity right, if it gets too hot in the room, guess what, start volatizing terpenes, if it gets
[26:28.230 --> 26:33.750]  too dry, guess what, terpenes start volatizing, if it gets too wet, terpenes won't produce, so we have
[26:33.750 --> 26:39.190]  to keep everything in line from day one, not just in flour, from the veg phase, we have to get it
[26:39.190 --> 26:44.630]  started in veg and take top shelf care of this plant all the way through whatever you got, like I
[26:44.630 --> 26:49.910]  said, six to eight weeks of veg, nine, ten, maybe eleven weeks of flour, take perfect care of that
[26:49.910 --> 26:55.910]  plant every single day, every day matters, if you've got one day where the VPD got off just a
[26:55.910 --> 27:00.630]  little bit, guess what, that will show in your end result, it could have been one, two, maybe three
[27:00.630 --> 27:07.110]  percent better, not three percent more THC, just overall a three percent better product. All right,
[27:07.110 --> 27:12.230]  another thing to think about is the environment in which you are drying, curing, and storing this
[27:12.230 --> 27:16.790]  product, a lot of people are growing down in a basement, or in a shed, or in a garage, or in a
[27:16.790 --> 27:22.550]  backyard, if that room stinks and smells funky when you hang up your plants, once all the moisture and
[27:22.550 --> 27:27.430]  everything goes away from your plants, it's going to start absorbing that stinky, funky, musty,
[27:27.430 --> 27:32.150]  grandma's basement sort of smell, and that will be stuck in your plants, if you're drying in the tool
[27:32.150 --> 27:36.950]  shed in the garage, and it smells like old lawnmowers, or it smells like old moldy house,
[27:36.950 --> 27:41.830]  that will end up in the flavor of your product, so think about where you're drying and curing it,
[27:41.830 --> 27:47.350]  have, so a week or two weeks before it's even time to harvest, start planning your drying and curing
[27:47.350 --> 27:51.110]  room, have that ready, look how much product you've got, think about how much space you're
[27:51.110 --> 27:55.990]  going to need to cure it, dry it, hang it up, think about how you're going to move the air in that room,
[27:55.990 --> 28:01.030]  keep the humidity and the temperature proper in that room, plan that now, because a lot of people,
[28:01.030 --> 28:05.350]  like I said a moment ago, have destroyed crops after the harvest phase, I've seen commercial
[28:05.350 --> 28:10.230]  grows take down giant harvests and not know what to do with it, and end up throwing half of it away,
[28:10.230 --> 28:14.630]  so half of their work got destroyed after the harvest phase, I'm going to check my notes,
[28:14.630 --> 28:19.750]  make sure I got everything here, yeah, dry it, cure it, store it properly, and again, there's no,
