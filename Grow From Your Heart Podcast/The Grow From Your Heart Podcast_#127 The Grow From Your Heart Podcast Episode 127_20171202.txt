[00:03.260 --> 00:21.830]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for episode number 127 of the Grow From
[00:21.830 --> 00:26.930]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:26.930 --> 00:30.610]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:30.610 --> 00:34.670]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.670 --> 00:39.330]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:39.330 --> 00:43.210]  host, my friends call me Ross DiGiuffo, and I thank you guys again for joining me. As
[00:43.210 --> 00:46.610]  always, I need to give a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.610 --> 00:51.730]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big thanks to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic
[00:51.730 --> 00:56.530]  Roots crew. That music was kind of loud. I apologize for that. I'm getting down over
[00:56.530 --> 01:01.090]  here. Man, I want to thank my guests for joining me. Sitting to my left is my good buddy, White
[01:01.090 --> 01:02.490]  Mike. White Mike, how you doing, buddy?
[01:02.490 --> 01:03.770]  Doing good, man. How are you?
[01:03.770 --> 01:07.650]  I am great. I'm fucked up on kombucha and Dr. Pepper. I'm all fired up and ready to
[01:07.650 --> 01:08.650]  do a good podcast.
[01:08.970 --> 01:10.690]  Yeah, I'm fired up too. This should be a good one.
[01:10.690 --> 01:14.370]  You got a bunch of Dr. Mountain Dew in front of you there. You should be fired up pretty
[01:14.370 --> 01:14.650]  well.
[01:14.650 --> 01:15.770]  Fired up, ready to go.
[01:15.770 --> 01:19.970]  Awesome. Right in front of me is my new, why did I say new? My old buddy, Gary. Thanks
[01:19.970 --> 01:20.650]  for joining me, bro.
[01:20.810 --> 01:21.890]  I am glad to be here.
[01:21.910 --> 01:25.250]  Do you represent any organization or are you just here out of Gary's kindness?
[01:25.290 --> 01:28.490]  Not at all. Just, you know, concerned citizen.
[01:28.490 --> 01:32.530]  Concerned citizen. Well, we're glad to have you. Very glad to have you. Before we get
[01:32.530 --> 01:37.290]  started in the podcast, I do have a few things I want to talk about. Remember when I said
[01:37.290 --> 01:40.650]  bad shit happens in threes, we lost three friends in the month of March.
[01:40.650 --> 01:43.610]  I want to give a huge shout out to my good friend, John Gerlach.
[01:44.130 --> 01:46.130]  John Gerlach was a local Pueblo musician.
[01:46.610 --> 01:48.290]  He played in a band known as Lizard Run.
[01:48.530 --> 01:49.890]  He played in all the open mics.
[01:49.890 --> 01:52.490]  He played with a bunch of the most popular musicians in Colorado.
[01:53.090 --> 01:54.450]  He was a really inspiring drummer.
[01:54.450 --> 01:56.050]  He was a guitar player. He was a vocalist.
[01:56.050 --> 01:58.610]  He was a songwriter. He wrote a couple of my favorite songs.
[01:58.610 --> 02:00.770]  He wrote a song called Fuck Buddy that always makes me giggle.
[02:01.010 --> 02:03.850]  Right. Everybody at the table smiled when they heard who couldn't smile at a song
[02:03.850 --> 02:06.730]  called Fuck Buddy. John was an amazing musician.
[02:07.090 --> 02:08.930]  They called him girly. So a big shout out to girly.
[02:08.970 --> 02:10.610]  Love you. Miss you, bro. Rest in peace.
[02:11.570 --> 02:14.690]  Fuck. Hopefully that's the last rest in peace we have to do on the podcast for quite
[02:14.690 --> 02:17.330]  a while. That was a third one in March.
[02:17.370 --> 02:18.490]  So God damn.
[02:19.330 --> 02:20.530]  Shout out to Gerlach. I love you, bro.
[02:21.690 --> 02:23.770]  Also, I have an email from a friend.
[02:24.490 --> 02:28.770]  I talked about dosage on the podcast of Edibles, and
[02:28.770 --> 02:32.970]  apparently I recommended too much because this guy said that
[02:33.050 --> 02:36.450]  his girlfriend was nearly tripping from the dosage that I recommended.
[02:37.130 --> 02:38.930]  Do you remember what you recommended?
[02:39.010 --> 02:40.650]  Oh, no, no, I don't.
[02:40.690 --> 02:43.850]  But I think we're supposed to recommend five or ten milligrams.
[02:43.890 --> 02:45.170]  I think I said twenty five.
[02:45.250 --> 02:46.330]  I think I said twenty five.
[02:48.010 --> 02:50.090]  Yeah, I hear a lot of people recommends.
[02:50.570 --> 02:54.330]  They tell people, oh, you've been smoking flour for years.
[02:54.730 --> 02:57.970]  You want to start with ten or twenty or thirty or forty.
[02:58.530 --> 02:59.730]  And I say that's nuts.
[03:00.250 --> 03:02.090]  Start with ten. Work your way up slow.
[03:02.650 --> 03:03.930]  It comes in a ten pack.
[03:04.130 --> 03:05.130]  Like, that's why.
[03:05.290 --> 03:07.130]  OK, so I apologize, you guys.
[03:07.890 --> 03:11.250]  If you got all wrecked because you ate too much edibles because of me, I owe you
[03:11.250 --> 03:15.410]  an apology and email me if that happened and I'll let you come
[03:15.410 --> 03:16.690]  punch me in the balls or something.
[03:16.690 --> 03:17.690]  We'll make it up to you.
[03:17.850 --> 03:21.930]  Edibles hit some people where you really want to start slow and
[03:22.250 --> 03:25.370]  keep your dose low for until you step it up.
[03:25.410 --> 03:28.050]  You want to know how hard it's going to hit you, how long it's going to take to
[03:28.050 --> 03:31.610]  hit you, because edibles will wreck you if you're not ready for it.
[03:32.210 --> 03:36.530]  You can come feed me too many edibles if you overdose yourself
[03:36.530 --> 03:37.690]  because of my advice.
[03:37.890 --> 03:39.490]  I'll let you do that. All right.
[03:39.570 --> 03:43.770]  So I apologize if I misguided somebody and made them eat too much THC.
[03:44.210 --> 03:47.530]  The correct dosage, if you're going to consume edibles and it's your first time
[03:47.530 --> 03:51.130]  and you're a noob, you should probably stick with ten milligrams to start.
[03:51.290 --> 03:53.090]  Wait about an hour if you don't feel anything.
[03:53.810 --> 03:55.170]  Wait another hour and eat ten more.
[03:55.170 --> 03:59.130]  Or do you think we should tell them to eat an hour and eat one, eat ten, wait
[03:59.130 --> 04:00.450]  two hours, two hours.
[04:01.090 --> 04:04.290]  All right. After two hours, it will have had time for your stomach to break it
[04:04.290 --> 04:06.610]  down, process it through your liver and get it into your blood.
[04:07.810 --> 04:10.330]  Don't eat more before that first windows up.
[04:10.370 --> 04:14.730]  If that window hits and you never felt anything, go ahead and step your dose up.
[04:15.610 --> 04:18.330]  But something should it kick or it kicked in.
[04:18.610 --> 04:22.530]  You just might not. I was going to say something I want to mention is oftentimes
[04:22.530 --> 04:25.210]  I'll eat some edibles as I'm getting ready to go somewhere and I'll be like,
[04:25.210 --> 04:26.450]  these edibles aren't even working.
[04:26.450 --> 04:27.530]  What the fuck is going on?
[04:27.810 --> 04:31.850]  And then you get wherever you're going and you're like, oh, man, edibles are
[04:31.850 --> 04:35.290]  working. So sometimes you got to get out of the house, you got to go for a walk.
[04:35.450 --> 04:37.330]  You got to just go to the store.
[04:37.810 --> 04:41.570]  But also, I feel like when I'm here, this is my comfort zone right here.
[04:41.570 --> 04:43.650]  I got the computer in front of me, the mixing board to one side.
[04:43.650 --> 04:45.650]  I got the email right here. I got another rig right here.
[04:45.650 --> 04:49.010]  I got my drink. If anything goes too wrong right here, there's a couch right
[04:49.010 --> 04:50.890]  there I can just lay down on, like within 10 feet.
[04:50.890 --> 04:54.490]  I'm cool right here. I don't feel like I get as high here.
[04:54.490 --> 04:56.570]  I could smoke a gram of hash right here and be OK.
[04:56.570 --> 05:00.610]  But if I smoked the same gram at your house, I would be three times as high and
[05:00.610 --> 05:02.330]  a little uncomfortable. Absolutely.
[05:02.330 --> 05:03.930]  It's just something about environment.
[05:03.930 --> 05:08.290]  Absolutely. Like for episode 100, I think I ate 50 milligrams while we were sitting
[05:08.290 --> 05:10.610]  here the other day. 20 just wrecked me.
[05:11.050 --> 05:13.330]  Like I was super high, having a blast.
[05:13.330 --> 05:14.930]  And it took me a minute to realize that.
[05:14.930 --> 05:18.130]  Like, wait a second. Yeah, it was just those two 10 milligram gummies that did
[05:18.130 --> 05:20.810]  this. I have a 100 milligram Markawa.
[05:20.810 --> 05:24.730]  Is that how you say it? They have a little liquid drink that they sell.
[05:24.730 --> 05:28.210]  I have a 100 milligram, one of those in my fridge right now that I'm going to go
[05:28.210 --> 05:29.210]  grab and consume.
[05:30.770 --> 05:32.490]  Not going to do it. All right.
[05:32.930 --> 05:35.570]  So, yeah, stick with the correct dosing, you guys.
[05:35.690 --> 05:36.730]  Don't get too wrecked.
[05:37.530 --> 05:39.370]  Go outside, go for a walk or something.
[05:40.130 --> 05:42.850]  Just take a break from your normal routine and see if it's kicked in yet.
[05:42.850 --> 05:44.970]  And then if it hasn't, then eat a little bit more.
[05:45.330 --> 05:49.410]  Well, just if you find yourself in over your head, just remember that you can't hurt
[05:49.410 --> 05:52.290]  yourself with weed. You can scare yourself real good.
[05:52.290 --> 05:53.410]  You can scare the shit out of you.
[05:53.410 --> 05:56.250]  You're not dying. If you're if you're freaking out, I'm dying.
[05:56.290 --> 05:58.530]  No, you're not. You're just really funny right now.
[05:58.610 --> 06:00.570]  You're just really high. Things seem weird.
[06:00.570 --> 06:02.490]  Give it a little while. You find a sandwich.
[06:02.490 --> 06:03.370]  You're going to be fine. Yeah.
[06:03.370 --> 06:04.610]  Eat something. Lay down.
[06:04.610 --> 06:05.850]  Drink some caffeine if you can.
[06:05.850 --> 06:06.810]  That always helps you come back.
[06:06.810 --> 06:08.610]  Dairy products, dairy products are the best.
[06:08.610 --> 06:09.730]  All right. All right.
[06:09.730 --> 06:13.890]  I don't do a lot of dairy products, but yeah, in cases you might have ice cream.
[06:13.890 --> 06:15.010]  Good. All right.
[06:15.170 --> 06:16.610]  It'll help tone it down a little bit.
[06:16.850 --> 06:18.770]  There you go. You know, get some food in.
[06:19.050 --> 06:24.450]  I had a bad edibles experience about my third edible that I consumed was a Dixie
[06:24.450 --> 06:28.450]  elixirs, 75 milligram soda of the drinks, the drink.
[06:28.450 --> 06:32.410]  And it was come on strong and it was really way too heavy.
[06:32.410 --> 06:34.450]  And I had like about a four hour panic attack.
[06:34.650 --> 06:38.490]  Wow. And now this is, you know, being a daily smoker for over 15 years.
[06:38.530 --> 06:44.130]  Yeah. And at that point I'd been dabbing daily for about three or four months.
[06:44.650 --> 06:46.450]  So I was not a novice in any way.
[06:46.690 --> 06:48.330]  Plenty of THC, plenty of experience.
[06:48.330 --> 06:50.570]  Holy crap. So yeah, edibles are really strange.
[06:50.570 --> 06:55.810]  And like when I first started doing edibles sometimes and those, like say the
[06:55.810 --> 07:00.650]  first five attempts, it would take like six to eight hours to kick in.
[07:00.810 --> 07:02.130]  Oh wow. Yeah.
[07:02.290 --> 07:03.290]  Well, you're a bigger dude.
[07:03.330 --> 07:04.810]  Yeah. Well, slow metabolism.
[07:04.810 --> 07:07.370]  Yeah. So it really varies depending on the person.
[07:07.610 --> 07:08.450]  They hit me.
[07:08.730 --> 07:12.090]  Oh man, I can almost swallow a damn edible and feel it coming on.
[07:12.090 --> 07:13.130]  Now. Oh shit. Here it comes.
[07:13.130 --> 07:16.730]  If it's more than 30 minutes, it's bullshit and I'm taking it back.
[07:17.010 --> 07:21.090]  I'm raising hell at somebody because I mean they come on right away now and I'm
[07:21.090 --> 07:23.770]  about at a hundred milligrams is where I need to be for a dose.
[07:23.850 --> 07:26.490]  Okay. And uh, that's, that's very effective for me.
[07:26.490 --> 07:28.570]  But now I take that to go to bed.
[07:29.130 --> 07:34.090]  That was how I use edibles. I have a, you know, an edible at night to go to bed.
[07:34.090 --> 07:34.890]  It helps with my pain.
[07:34.890 --> 07:37.610]  About how, how long before bedtime do you consume?
[07:37.610 --> 07:38.250]  About an hour.
[07:38.290 --> 07:41.130]  Okay. That's what I would recommend also. All right. We're on the same page here.
[07:41.530 --> 07:45.330]  There's a recent news story up out of Denver that, uh,
[07:45.850 --> 07:50.450]  the people going to the ER for marijuana related reasons are predominantly from
[07:50.450 --> 07:54.410]  out of state. Yeah. And this is why, well, um, they go to the store,
[07:54.410 --> 07:57.890]  they don't listen to the butt tender. They eat the whole incredible bar. Um,
[07:57.970 --> 08:02.650]  and they end up fried and they don't have anybody with them. We go,
[08:02.690 --> 08:06.050]  Oh, calm down, honey. Here, have some Haagen Dazs and a bottle of water.
[08:06.050 --> 08:10.850]  You're going to be just fine. Um, and they ended up in the hospital, um,
[08:10.890 --> 08:12.250]  just go slow. People.
[08:12.570 --> 08:15.250]  Once you're that high, it's hard to convince yourself. You're not that high,
[08:15.530 --> 08:20.130]  right? It's you're, you're on drugs. Like, you know what I mean? Like I'm on drugs,
[08:20.130 --> 08:22.130]  man. I'm freaking out. You just don't know what to do anymore.
[08:22.370 --> 08:26.810]  Also, you know, when I lived in Texas because of price constraints,
[08:26.810 --> 08:31.810]  I was about a gram a day smoker. Right. And flowers are hash flowers.
[08:32.010 --> 08:36.050]  Okay. Only flowers. Okay. And uh, cause that's all you can get. Oh, in Texas.
[08:36.050 --> 08:37.690]  All right. Yeah. You know what I mean? And it was,
[08:37.690 --> 08:41.130]  turn this mic towards you just a little bit. There you go. Is it on? Oh,
[08:41.690 --> 08:43.850]  yeah, it's good. I sounded like it went off when you touched it.
[08:44.010 --> 08:47.330]  That was really odd touching that plug. Yeah. No, anyway. Um,
[08:47.490 --> 08:50.650]  it was just more of a cost thing, you know, cause it's fucking expensive.
[08:50.650 --> 08:53.250]  Oh yeah. And you know what I mean? So you have to, you know,
[08:53.250 --> 08:55.090]  you have to budget. So I was, you know,
[08:55.090 --> 08:59.010]  I'd smoked about a gram of flowers a day and when I could get concentrates,
[08:59.010 --> 09:02.410]  I would get them, but there were few and far between. They were very expensive.
[09:03.170 --> 09:05.050]  I'm just paying like 60 bucks. And I ate. Isn't,
[09:05.090 --> 09:09.490]  isn't it like a gram of concentrate, a felony in Texas? Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
[09:09.650 --> 09:13.450]  So this table right here, we could all go to prison. Oh, we would be, dude,
[09:13.490 --> 09:14.650]  they could just shoot us.
[09:17.410 --> 09:20.810]  They don't play with concentrates. Maybe the mic will look, look at what they had.
[09:20.810 --> 09:24.290]  You got to come on. We were afraid for our lives. Yeah.
[09:24.290 --> 09:28.650]  They're going to turn into weed zombies. God damn it. Yeah. I mean, but you know,
[09:28.730 --> 09:32.810]  yeah. You know, the quality also varied a lot with that weed. Yeah. Cause you,
[09:32.810 --> 09:36.290]  you know, it was the illegal state. So my, you know,
[09:36.290 --> 09:39.330]  the levels of THC I had in my body then were not what they are now.
[09:39.450 --> 09:41.090]  And if you're coming from out of state here,
[09:41.330 --> 09:43.570]  especially from a state where it's still illegal, right.
[09:43.610 --> 09:46.890]  You're not a medical user. Yeah. Edibles are a whole different world.
[09:46.930 --> 09:51.090]  They sell a 350 milligram edible and it's a tiny little thing.
[09:51.090 --> 09:54.130]  And I think that's a little dangerous. I, that could be dangerous for me.
[09:54.250 --> 09:56.850]  I ate that on a podcast and if I didn't have this chair,
[09:57.170 --> 10:00.530]  I might have flown away like this chair and computer and table or all that kept
[10:00.530 --> 10:02.170]  me on this planet. That's hilarious.
[10:02.410 --> 10:07.130]  It's just people got to realize that it's edibles are a different kind of high.
[10:07.130 --> 10:08.610]  It's not like smoking. Like it's,
[10:08.610 --> 10:12.090]  it's real easy to notice you've had enough and stop hitting the joint as it
[10:12.090 --> 10:16.650]  goes around the circle. Uh, you can't uneat drugs. I say that a lot of work.
[10:16.890 --> 10:20.090]  Yeah. Um, once, once you decide that you're going to eat it,
[10:20.090 --> 10:24.170]  you're on that rollercoaster until it comes to a complete stop. Um,
[10:24.210 --> 10:27.170]  there's no eject button in the middle and you just have to ride it out.
[10:27.170 --> 10:29.450]  Like unfortunately you really can't hurt.
[10:29.450 --> 10:33.290]  Like you're going to wake up tomorrow. Yeah. You're going to be fine. Um,
[10:33.330 --> 10:36.290]  as long as you don't, don't call your mom. Yeah.
[10:37.490 --> 10:40.850]  Call your mom. Don't call the cops. Don't, don't call the paramedics.
[10:40.850 --> 10:42.650]  Definitely don't call the cops. Call a friend.
[10:42.970 --> 10:46.370]  Let them know that you ate too many edibles. I got to talk to you. Yeah.
[10:46.410 --> 10:50.770]  Call Domino's get a pizza on family guy. There you go. Get some almond.
[10:50.970 --> 10:54.770]  For Joe Buzzy put on the Simpsons. That one's for Buzzy. The Simpson. Yeah.
[10:54.890 --> 10:57.530]  Buzzy Buzzy is a Simpson. Some almond brothers. All right.
[10:57.530 --> 10:59.970]  So we've corrected that issue. And once again, I apologize.
[10:59.970 --> 11:02.370]  I keep saying that, but I feel bad if somebody did wreck themselves,
[11:02.370 --> 11:05.170]  I'm an asshole. That's not cool to do to people. Tell them to take too much.
[11:05.170 --> 11:09.010]  I do sincerely feel bad if I wrecked somebody's life day, weekend, evening,
[11:09.010 --> 11:09.930]  whatever. I mean,
[11:10.090 --> 11:13.650]  just start real low folks. It's there's nothing wrong with that.
[11:14.450 --> 11:17.250]  Uh, what's the most you've ever eaten? The most edibles milligrams you've ever
[11:17.250 --> 11:21.290]  eaten. Let me back up one question. What's your daily dose of edibles?
[11:21.290 --> 11:25.490]  I know you like to eat the, uh, the little 50 milligram. Uh, was that the,
[11:25.490 --> 11:28.610]  no, they're, they're super soft. They're a, it's a synergy.
[11:28.610 --> 11:33.610]  It's five and five, five milligram THC, five milligram CBD, um,
[11:33.650 --> 11:36.410]  product and morning and night. And then, uh,
[11:37.530 --> 11:41.290]  I augment that with, I've been doing a lot of green Hornets lately from Chiba.
[11:41.650 --> 11:44.890]  Oh, that's a great product. Shout out to Chiba. Choose non-paid advertisement.
[11:45.170 --> 11:49.690]  Yeah. That's sorry. They're just, uh, they're a great advertising.
[11:50.530 --> 11:54.450]  I've been a fan since they weren't just medical. Um, and yeah,
[11:54.450 --> 11:55.410]  I sell them all day now.
[11:55.410 --> 11:58.650]  So I take a bottle home every couple of days just to enjoy randomly.
[11:59.330 --> 12:03.010]  All right. So for a medical dose, how much THC do you like to consume?
[12:03.290 --> 12:05.850]  Um, if it's, if it's just like,
[12:05.850 --> 12:09.170]  I just take it as a preventative against inflammation in my knees and neck right
[12:09.170 --> 12:14.170]  now. So I'm around 10 to 20 milligrams CBD and THC a day.
[12:14.770 --> 12:18.250]  Okay. Um, and then like, if my back's messed up or really hurting,
[12:18.250 --> 12:22.810]  or I'm going crazy and my knees are pissed, I'll up it to 35, 40,
[12:22.810 --> 12:25.930]  50 of each edibles per day.
[12:26.250 --> 12:30.210]  Do you have like a recreational, like if you're going to take a recreational dose,
[12:30.210 --> 12:31.890]  how much do you like to like to take there?
[12:32.450 --> 12:37.450]  Um, anywhere between like 20 and 35 or 40 milligrams of THC.
[12:38.170 --> 12:41.890]  Okay. Um, what's the most you've ever eaten was going to be my big question on
[12:41.890 --> 12:43.530]  250 or 300.
[12:43.850 --> 12:47.450]  And that's just what I know from the rec market.
[12:47.450 --> 12:50.730]  Like God only knows what used to go into these moments.
[12:50.770 --> 12:55.210]  I remember back in the day when Karen or I used to make the banana bread, dude.
[12:55.250 --> 12:58.090]  Oh my God. Yeah. I, uh,
[12:58.570 --> 13:03.570]  so we have a friend who was a grown man who ate one of those and fell down some
[13:03.890 --> 13:06.890]  stairs and knocked me down the bottom portion of those stairs.
[13:06.890 --> 13:08.410]  Cause he was too high to function.
[13:08.410 --> 13:10.530]  And I was too high to save myself once he hit me,
[13:10.530 --> 13:13.290]  he fell down and I took me to like a bowling pin. Yeah.
[13:13.290 --> 13:15.610]  And just went down the style. There's only a couple of stairs. It was fun.
[13:15.970 --> 13:18.370]  But this grown man just poof, poof, poof, poof,
[13:18.650 --> 13:22.050]  and giggled like a child because this banana bread was just killing us.
[13:22.250 --> 13:24.330]  It was wrecking us. Those days were amazing.
[13:24.370 --> 13:27.290]  There aren't edibles like that available in dispensaries. I don't think.
[13:27.490 --> 13:31.250]  God only knows how strong that was because nothing was figured out as well as
[13:31.250 --> 13:32.090]  it is now.
[13:32.250 --> 13:33.250]  I, you know, I do that.
[13:33.250 --> 13:37.730]  I make my own sometimes and I made some butter today actually out of a, well,
[13:37.730 --> 13:40.250]  I made, what I did was I had,
[13:40.410 --> 13:43.530]  I bought ounces of wax about five of them.
[13:44.530 --> 13:45.370]  Okay.
[13:46.210 --> 13:49.410]  Over time. And, um, so I had all these papers,
[13:49.810 --> 13:51.730]  I still had a lot of residual on them. Oh yeah.
[13:51.730 --> 13:54.050]  So I put them in a slow cooker with coconut oil.
[13:54.530 --> 13:57.490]  You just soaked all that off of them. Yeah. And then I put, you know,
[13:57.490 --> 14:01.890]  a big plop of wax in there too and just let it, you know,
[14:02.010 --> 14:05.770]  simmer a while. Now that's in the freezer. And, um, you know,
[14:05.770 --> 14:09.770]  I'll use that for making some edibles. Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, yeah.
[14:09.770 --> 14:11.610]  But there's no way to tell how much is in there.
[14:11.610 --> 14:12.450]  Yeah.
[14:13.370 --> 14:16.410]  He's got to taste it and see what happens. Make them small.
[14:19.570 --> 14:21.170]  All right. So you, you, Gary was saying, uh,
[14:21.170 --> 14:23.930]  you like to take a hundred milligrams about an hour before bedtime to help you
[14:23.930 --> 14:27.370]  sleep. Do you, uh, do, do you increase that if you want to get recreational?
[14:27.410 --> 14:31.490]  Actually I decreased it to get recreation. Okay. So about a 50 milligram dose.
[14:31.530 --> 14:34.090]  Because the hundred makes you sleep. Exactly. You don't want to overdo it.
[14:34.410 --> 14:37.410]  You're going to have to take 200 to sleep every night. Exactly. Well, it's,
[14:37.410 --> 14:40.450]  it's a little too much, you know, right. It's, it puts me out. Yeah.
[14:40.530 --> 14:44.210]  So half of that, about 50, sometimes about a 75 makes you a little,
[14:44.250 --> 14:47.970]  if I get those, uh, peanut butter Buddha bars from, Oh yeah.
[14:48.050 --> 14:50.370]  They've been getting a lot of advertising. Those are so,
[14:50.490 --> 14:52.330]  I like the monkey bar guys. If you're going to ask,
[14:52.370 --> 14:56.410]  and those are a 35 milligram sections. Okay.
[14:56.490 --> 15:00.650]  So two of those is 70. That's a good dose for me. All right. For, you know,
[15:00.650 --> 15:02.610]  to function and have a good time. Okay.
[15:02.810 --> 15:04.810]  I like to eat the whole hundred milligram monkey bar.
[15:05.090 --> 15:10.090]  Those are the 350 milligram, uh, peanut butter bar from, uh,
[15:10.090 --> 15:12.850]  mountain medicine. Yes. I've had a couple of those. Oh man.
[15:12.850 --> 15:13.690]  Those things are good.
[15:13.850 --> 15:17.370]  Like 50 used to be my sweet spot like eight, nine months ago,
[15:17.370 --> 15:21.250]  50 was my sweet spot. Um, but I mean,
[15:21.250 --> 15:25.530]  just recently there was a like 20 milligrams. I had, it was an empty stomach day.
[15:26.170 --> 15:26.450]  Um,
[15:26.450 --> 15:29.090]  I kind of popped them without thinking while I was doing chores around the
[15:29.090 --> 15:32.490]  house and I caught myself doing laundry, like super into folding the towels.
[15:33.050 --> 15:38.050]  I'm from, I want to give a huge shout out to Maddie. Uh, Maddie made pot tarts.
[15:38.370 --> 15:40.970]  Ooh. Uh, she made medicated jelly.
[15:41.250 --> 15:43.410]  The jelly straight up had hash oil in it.
[15:43.730 --> 15:48.010]  And then she made like doughy crust, like pop tart crust. Wow.
[15:48.050 --> 15:50.970]  It was medicated as well. And then she made frosting.
[15:51.010 --> 15:52.570]  That was a medicated as well.
[15:53.090 --> 15:58.090]  And she gave me a good size portion for my birthday and I ate it and I tried to
[15:58.250 --> 16:02.130]  drive to work and it kicked in about three quarters of the way to work.
[16:02.130 --> 16:05.850]  And I was like, what just happened? Like, I was like, something just weird.
[16:06.010 --> 16:09.210]  I was like, did my car just break down? Like, did I just get a flat tire?
[16:09.210 --> 16:11.690]  Did the wind just kick in? Did the earth just die?
[16:11.690 --> 16:15.810]  Cause suddenly everything was just like, that was weird. Uh, Maddie wrecked me.
[16:15.810 --> 16:18.250]  I don't know how many milligrams were in that edible, but shout out to Maddie.
[16:18.250 --> 16:21.370]  That thing was fucking tremendous. Right? Yeah. It was a hard day at work.
[16:21.450 --> 16:22.850]  Everything got done at half speed.
[16:23.690 --> 16:27.290]  This is some of the strongest wax I've ever had. This, uh,
[16:27.410 --> 16:32.410]  the guy who made it had a outdoor grow and he let it cure.
[16:33.010 --> 16:36.770]  It was beautiful. We had this great smell. It's lamb's breath. Okay.
[16:36.970 --> 16:41.970]  And so it's, it was, the trim was all cured when he blew it. Nice.
[16:42.250 --> 16:44.450]  And it tastes good. It smells good.
[16:44.450 --> 16:47.890]  I'm kicking myself for not bringing some for you to try. It's so really good.
[16:47.890 --> 16:52.130]  And that's what I made the coconut oil with. It'll be amazing. Yeah.
[16:52.130 --> 16:54.490]  So it's some of the strongest I've ever had. Nice. I mean,
[16:54.490 --> 16:57.770]  it's not like the best I've ever had, but it's the strongest. What's the, uh,
[16:57.770 --> 17:00.130]  what's the biggest dose of, uh, edibles you've ever taken?
[17:00.450 --> 17:03.650]  I think the three 50 mountain medicine bar. Okay. Yeah. I ate one of the,
[17:03.650 --> 17:07.570]  I think it was episode 36 or it was one of the earlier ones, but yeah,
[17:07.570 --> 17:10.210]  it was a funny show. Shout out to mountain medicine too.
[17:10.210 --> 17:14.890]  They're really cost effective man. They're affordable and affordable and, uh,
[17:14.930 --> 17:19.170]  they, they deliver. I'm going to take a dab. So somebody say something important.
[17:20.370 --> 17:24.570]  Well, the, we actually had a purpose behind this show. We have a topic at hand.
[17:24.570 --> 17:27.330]  It's not just fun ramblings. Yeah. We got a couple of,
[17:27.850 --> 17:30.330]  I got two more things I have to cover and then I'll unleash you guys on that.
[17:30.330 --> 17:34.330]  So let me, uh, since I took that dab, shout out to a higher elevated,
[17:34.610 --> 17:36.770]  let me find, I took a dab. So bear with my brain,
[17:37.010 --> 17:39.330]  higher elevation masterpiece productions.
[17:39.330 --> 17:43.530]  That's the name of the place and also elevate glass gallery in Colorado Springs,
[17:43.970 --> 17:47.730]  a higher elevation masterpiece production can repair your broken rig.
[17:47.890 --> 17:50.170]  They will fix your broken glass. They will hook you up.
[17:50.210 --> 17:54.770]  They're in Colorado Springs, search for them on the internet or call them 7 1 9 6
[17:54.930 --> 17:59.210]  4 6 5 3 5 2. They can fix your broken rig. They're in Colorado Springs.
[17:59.610 --> 18:02.050]  Cool ass people. Great shop. Uh,
[18:02.090 --> 18:05.250]  that is higher elevation masterpiece productions and their sister store.
[18:05.250 --> 18:07.730]  Is that what you call it? I think it's our sister store, their homie store,
[18:07.970 --> 18:11.850]  their partner store. The other store down the way is elevate. Uh,
[18:11.890 --> 18:16.050]  that one is on five 17 South Tahoe. Uh, both are really cool shops.
[18:16.050 --> 18:19.010]  I recommend them. The people are wonderful. The customer service is great.
[18:19.010 --> 18:22.570]  They've got a great selection of affordable rigs. They've got brand name rigs.
[18:22.730 --> 18:25.170]  They've got hit man rigs in there. They've got D nails in there.
[18:25.170 --> 18:28.250]  They've got highly educated titanium products. Dude,
[18:28.250 --> 18:30.690]  they've got a product in there. I can't believe I didn't buy while I was there.
[18:31.250 --> 18:35.090]  Uh, they've got the highly educated nail with the ceramic or not ceramic with the
[18:35.090 --> 18:36.170]  quartz dish on top.
[18:36.490 --> 18:39.050]  So you got the titanium base with the quartz dish on top,
[18:39.450 --> 18:43.090]  pretty much indestructible. If you take care of it, uh, go get that.
[18:43.090 --> 18:46.650]  That's a bad-ass piece. But anyway, shout out to those places. Uh, I support them.
[18:46.650 --> 18:50.650]  I recommend them if you're in Colorado Springs. Also one more big, uh,
[18:50.650 --> 18:54.330]  important message. I've been advertising the secret session on four 20, uh,
[18:54.370 --> 18:55.170]  change of plans.
[18:55.330 --> 18:59.770]  Secret sessions now on four 21 because of some logistics in the city of Denver
[18:59.770 --> 19:03.090]  and things that go on when you're trying to plan a cannabis event and people try
[19:03.090 --> 19:06.650]  to be fucked cards, but secret session on four 21, make sure you support that.
[19:07.010 --> 19:10.170]  Um, email me for more information or follow.
[19:10.170 --> 19:13.530]  I think it's secret sesh Colorado on Instagram. Check that out.
[19:13.770 --> 19:16.810]  I think that's all of the advertising and butt kissing I've got to do for the
[19:16.810 --> 19:17.410]  start of the show.
[19:17.410 --> 19:21.850]  But now we can get into the topics that I've invited these young men here for.
[19:22.570 --> 19:23.970]  Uh, it's like a steel cage match.
[19:23.970 --> 19:26.130]  I just looked at both these guys like I was about to ask him if they're ready to
[19:26.130 --> 19:26.970]  fight.
[19:29.210 --> 19:32.650]  Gary's like, nah, bro. I was in a car wreck a while back. I'm ready to show up.
[19:32.650 --> 19:34.850]  Take dabs. Yeah. Um,
[19:34.890 --> 19:37.690]  so the reason that these guys wanted to get together,
[19:37.690 --> 19:40.730]  they actually both messaged me wanting to do a podcast on this topic.
[19:40.730 --> 19:43.410]  So I love the initiative. Thank you guys. Yeah. Um,
[19:43.690 --> 19:47.090]  our local anti cannabis, um, groups,
[19:47.130 --> 19:49.730]  is it one group or were there multiple groups involved in this bullshit?
[19:50.930 --> 19:53.050]  There might be a second group now.
[19:53.090 --> 19:56.250]  It could just be the first group using a new name. Okay.
[19:56.330 --> 19:59.090]  Well then let's not name either one of them or more.
[19:59.090 --> 20:00.410]  So that way they don't get any more support.
[20:00.410 --> 20:02.290]  Unless most of our people want to go troll them.
[20:02.290 --> 20:04.570]  Do you want to mention them so that maybe perhaps people,
[20:04.570 --> 20:09.330]  and I couldn't ask our listeners to go and troll these people and say crazy
[20:09.330 --> 20:11.890]  shit on their page. But if they did, I couldn't stop them.
[20:12.370 --> 20:13.770]  Um, or better yet,
[20:13.770 --> 20:18.770]  just go correct their nonsense politely and watch them stew and freak out on you
[20:19.490 --> 20:21.090]  cause it makes them look even worse.
[20:21.130 --> 20:23.010]  And they can't figure out what to say. It's really funny.
[20:23.050 --> 20:24.610]  They don't have any research at all,
[20:24.690 --> 20:27.850]  but I think we'll just give them an easy way to find them.
[20:28.410 --> 20:30.490]  Just go to your page. Yeah. Just come to my page.
[20:30.490 --> 20:34.370]  So go check out Mike's Facebook page. It is Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[20:34.410 --> 20:36.170]  I clicked like, I appreciate it.
[20:36.170 --> 20:39.770]  I like to follow the updates of what's going on. Mike is a very, um,
[20:39.890 --> 20:40.490]  I don't know the word,
[20:40.490 --> 20:43.570]  but he knows what the fuck is going on in the cannabis world and our local and
[20:43.570 --> 20:47.370]  our state, uh, nationwide, worldwide. Mike stays up on top of it. Yeah.
[20:47.610 --> 20:50.570]  And so when I need some updates on cannabis, I go to Mike all the time.
[20:50.570 --> 20:52.610]  He's my politics and cannabis update guy.
[20:53.010 --> 20:55.970]  There's a lot going on right now. So I'm insanely busy.
[20:56.130 --> 21:00.410]  It's good for you. Keep that mind busy. All right. So let's talk about, uh,
[21:00.970 --> 21:05.210]  this local group here is trying to close all of the recreational cannabis.
[21:05.250 --> 21:06.970]  Are they doing just record? They want to do medical.
[21:07.050 --> 21:10.810]  Well, they want it all gone. And if you, um,
[21:10.890 --> 21:14.770]  head over to their page at all and look through their post history, um,
[21:15.330 --> 21:20.330]  medical is a sham. It's all a joke and a scam and a con to make money,
[21:21.170 --> 21:25.210]  um, on the backs of our children and they want it all gone.
[21:25.730 --> 21:30.730]  But right now they're just focused on getting rid of the rec industry.
[21:30.930 --> 21:35.170]  So recreational stores, production facilities, manufacturers,
[21:35.570 --> 21:40.330]  grows, testing labs, all of it. They want it gone. Yep. Because,
[21:40.650 --> 21:44.170]  because it's bad. Yeah.
[21:44.330 --> 21:47.770]  I that's the only reason I could find on their Facebook page because drugs are
[21:47.770 --> 21:48.610]  bad. I'm okay.
[21:49.370 --> 21:54.250]  The one article that kind of got into a little bit of their reasons.
[21:54.810 --> 21:56.410]  Um, they don't like that.
[21:56.570 --> 21:59.730]  There are more homeless people in the city than there were before.
[22:00.450 --> 22:04.890]  They seem to think the crime problem in the city is new. Um,
[22:04.890 --> 22:09.530]  and somehow cannabis shops in the County related and, um,
[22:10.650 --> 22:15.650]  they, uh, there's another one, the tax that the tax proceeds that come in are
[22:16.650 --> 22:21.490]  really, really, really well reported. Um, and they,
[22:21.530 --> 22:24.490]  they're pretty sure that if they get rid of the taxes,
[22:24.490 --> 22:28.410]  then no one in government will have a reason to continue to support the
[22:28.410 --> 22:30.810]  marijuana industry and they'll be able to get rid of the rest of it.
[22:31.810 --> 22:32.170]  Yeah.
[22:32.170 --> 22:37.170]  Like it doesn't make a lot of sense and most of their issues are with home
[22:37.370 --> 22:39.450]  grows. Um,
[22:39.530 --> 22:41.850]  and they're not going to get rid of any home grows.
[22:41.850 --> 22:45.930]  If they get rid of the stores, they're going to produce significantly more of
[22:45.930 --> 22:46.290]  them.
[22:46.290 --> 22:50.130]  Yeah, absolutely. And it'll cater to the black market all over again.
[22:50.410 --> 22:51.930]  Right. Go ahead, Gary.
[22:51.970 --> 22:52.170]  Well,
[22:52.170 --> 22:56.690]  we should talk about home grows because there's been a big push on home grows
[22:56.690 --> 23:00.930]  lately, everywhere, multiple raids in Denver, down here,
[23:01.090 --> 23:04.290]  Park County, uh, Montrose, uh,
[23:04.530 --> 23:09.050]  17 raids since March 1st. And I'm aware of there, uh,
[23:09.090 --> 23:12.610]  in the, in the state, um, you know, a major, major growth,
[23:13.210 --> 23:16.850]  the bigger PR if you're trying to do major production out of your house and
[23:16.850 --> 23:21.290]  you're not an incredibly well-known medical patient, um,
[23:21.330 --> 23:26.330]  and caregiver that's registered and active in their local politics and stuff.
[23:26.970 --> 23:29.090]  Um, I'd have your paperwork in order.
[23:29.530 --> 23:31.090]  And have your plant count in order.
[23:31.570 --> 23:35.090]  Check your local and County ordinances because a lot of the cities and counties
[23:35.090 --> 23:38.370]  are passing limiting plan, limiting plant counts while you're asleep.
[23:38.570 --> 23:40.690]  They're doing it in private sessions while you're asleep.
[23:40.690 --> 23:43.610]  You're waking up to a no, a new plant count.
[23:43.610 --> 23:44.810]  And they're just out in your backyard,
[23:44.810 --> 23:47.090]  cutting down your plants because you're out of compliance overnight.
[23:47.370 --> 23:51.450]  Yep. They, uh, most of it around Colorado's complaint driven.
[23:52.050 --> 23:56.330]  Um, there were a couple of well publicized bus down here in Pueblo. Um,
[23:56.330 --> 24:01.250]  one of them was because the neighbor complained about some shit that most
[24:01.250 --> 24:04.610]  neighbors would have complained about. Um, and then the other one,
[24:04.610 --> 24:09.610]  they got busted in Florida with a car full of weed, Texas or Texas or wherever.
[24:09.650 --> 24:14.410]  And they got tracked back here. Um, and, uh, fuckers.
[24:15.450 --> 24:19.090]  But the interesting part about both of those is that it was people from far away
[24:19.090 --> 24:20.970]  trying to grow weed here and take it somewhere else.
[24:20.970 --> 24:24.170]  Well, and also they were like, like the guy, the,
[24:24.250 --> 24:29.250]  the biggest bus was five grow houses in Pueblo West and everybody involved.
[24:30.330 --> 24:33.730]  12 people had all been in Colorado less than 60 days.
[24:34.050 --> 24:37.210]  Right. There are people that they, that's a problem.
[24:37.250 --> 24:41.290]  They don't know any part of the rules and they think they can do whatever they
[24:41.290 --> 24:42.970]  want. They don't even know what to hide.
[24:43.050 --> 24:45.890]  They're not even well informed enough to know to hide. Right. Yeah.
[24:45.890 --> 24:49.730]  It's just not, it's just really sloppy and stupid. Absolutely.
[24:50.250 --> 24:53.610]  But it makes the rest of us look bad. You know, it's my point there.
[24:53.610 --> 24:57.890]  And you know, there's, there is an effort right now, um,
[24:58.210 --> 25:02.170]  from the regulatory bodies. Right. And we're seeing it, you know,
[25:02.490 --> 25:04.170]  like Mike was pointing out earlier,
[25:04.170 --> 25:08.970]  the regulations change abruptly frequently and you know,
[25:08.970 --> 25:12.330]  you have to really stay on top. And, uh, it's,
[25:12.570 --> 25:16.410]  it's almost like they're attempting to trip people,
[25:16.450 --> 25:20.330]  license holders up so that they can find them or pull their license.
[25:20.330 --> 25:23.050]  Now that they have their funds, you know what I mean? Those massive license.
[25:23.050 --> 25:25.450]  Yeah. I don't know. You can't really say that,
[25:25.730 --> 25:30.050]  but a lot of the rules aren't passed with how they'll be implemented in mind.
[25:31.370 --> 25:33.730]  And so when they're writing the law, they pick an hour. Okay.
[25:33.730 --> 25:38.290]  It's going to pass today. Let's give them six months from the today to get it,
[25:38.370 --> 25:39.650]  to get any compliance.
[25:39.650 --> 25:42.490]  And sometimes they're talking about like major construction issues.
[25:42.730 --> 25:46.570]  Are you guys dealing with the new packaging rules at the spot? Yeah,
[25:46.570 --> 25:49.530]  everybody is. That's so stupid, isn't it? So sorry to go.
[25:50.050 --> 25:51.170]  It's just one of those things.
[25:51.930 --> 25:54.010]  That just recently happened in the MED tracking system.
[25:54.010 --> 25:55.650]  Every time you buy loose flour,
[25:55.650 --> 25:58.050]  I've got to give you a small pamphlet full of information.
[25:58.050 --> 25:59.650]  Basically it's so many printed labels.
[26:01.290 --> 26:02.450]  And then the package there,
[26:02.450 --> 26:05.090]  how everything's a separate package and a batch number at the end of the day.
[26:05.130 --> 26:05.970]  Yeah. Nevermind. I'm sorry.
[26:06.130 --> 26:09.170]  It's uh, the tracking is nuts.
[26:09.210 --> 26:12.650]  Like if you think you can move here from far from another state,
[26:13.050 --> 26:16.570]  grow weed here easily and then ship it back. You're fucking nuts.
[26:16.610 --> 26:17.730]  Yeah. They're looking for that.
[26:17.730 --> 26:22.730]  Yes. Dulls. They're looking for that. And B the neighbors are like,
[26:23.170 --> 26:23.890]  we,
[26:23.890 --> 26:28.890]  your local paper hasn't reported on the hundreds of hours in city council
[26:29.770 --> 26:32.650]  meetings that people have spent arguing zoning rules.
[26:33.170 --> 26:37.050]  You haven't seen the hundreds of news articles about them every day in your
[26:37.050 --> 26:41.130]  local paper. Um, you just get the major news bulletins.
[26:41.170 --> 26:45.570]  And so the rest of us know, okay, you can't have 600 plants in your backyard.
[26:46.050 --> 26:48.970]  That guy's probably breaking the law. So he's going to call the cops on him.
[26:50.090 --> 26:51.090]  Um, don't go over there for a while.
[26:51.170 --> 26:51.690]  Well,
[26:51.690 --> 26:56.690]  I understand that this movement to make Pueblo West a city is related somehow to
[26:58.810 --> 27:02.730]  the anti cannabis stuff that if they can get incorporated as a city,
[27:02.730 --> 27:05.770]  they can get rid of it too. They then put you under municipal rule.
[27:05.930 --> 27:07.850]  You're not under the County rule anymore. There's a,
[27:08.130 --> 27:11.170]  I think that's their plan B is what I understand.
[27:11.210 --> 27:13.490]  There's a couple of possible plan B's.
[27:13.850 --> 27:17.090]  How many people, if, if the cannabis business were shut down,
[27:17.090 --> 27:20.090]  if I said right now, no more cannabis business in Pueblo West,
[27:20.090 --> 27:23.610]  no more recreational cannabis, how many jobs would be lost?
[27:24.210 --> 27:28.370]  Um, immediately it would be somewhere between 700 and a thousand people that's
[27:28.370 --> 27:33.010]  badged employees working at stores, grows, production facilities,
[27:33.010 --> 27:33.970]  edible companies.
[27:34.050 --> 27:36.930]  And then there's going to be lawyers accountants.
[27:37.250 --> 27:40.930]  There's everybody else. The accountants, the lawyers, um, consultants,
[27:40.970 --> 27:45.810]  the consultants like Gary over here, the security companies, the contractors,
[27:46.410 --> 27:49.250]  the growth store is going to start losing money for sure. Well,
[27:49.570 --> 27:52.570]  they might do better because of more home grows are going to spring up.
[27:53.170 --> 27:56.010]  I mean, that's obvious. It's going to take a lot of hard.
[27:56.010 --> 27:58.450]  I was going to say, yeah, the volume that those places do.
[27:58.450 --> 27:59.890]  It's going to be, yeah, it's going to be,
[28:01.130 --> 28:02.770]  it's going to throw a lot of stuff in disarray.
[28:02.770 --> 28:04.010]  It's not gonna be good for anybody.
[28:04.930 --> 28:07.730]  It takes more than two vehicles to load up our soil order.
[28:07.730 --> 28:10.130]  When we go buy soil at the shop, I mean,
[28:10.250 --> 28:13.130]  Pueblo can't take a hit like that right now. Um,
[28:13.490 --> 28:17.290]  for a thousand people to be out of work overnight, um,
[28:18.250 --> 28:22.370]  simply can't handle the demographic that is employed in most of these facilities
[28:22.370 --> 28:26.730]  are 25 to 35 to 40 year old folks right now.
[28:26.730 --> 28:29.010]  And there's no job. Yeah. Yeah.
[28:29.210 --> 28:32.370]  Yeah. And they're used to living off those bud tender tips and shit like that.
[28:32.410 --> 28:36.410]  They're not going back to the bank, you know, right. If they lose this job,
[28:36.570 --> 28:38.530]  actually we had somebody trying to do that recently,
[28:38.530 --> 28:42.210]  a friend of ours who lost his job or decided to not be involved in the cannabis
[28:42.210 --> 28:43.730]  industry, tried to go get a job at a bank.
[28:43.730 --> 28:46.330]  And he has to try to figure out how to make that adjustment,
[28:46.770 --> 28:48.450]  make it look good on a resume and such.
[28:49.170 --> 28:52.890]  No, the hit that Pueblo would take just with those jobs is bad.
[28:52.890 --> 28:56.770]  But when you consider that secondary supporting ring, I mean,
[28:56.770 --> 29:01.130]  there's a hundred other industries that you need to run a dispensary.
[29:01.290 --> 29:04.090]  And the tax. Um, I don't have the article on my computer screen,
[29:04.090 --> 29:08.010]  but I should mention the part about the, uh, the scholarships.
[29:08.170 --> 29:12.010]  Well, it's enough money, $5 million out of the County budget next year.
[29:12.010 --> 29:15.850]  If that like, that's what they're projected to make this year. So if, uh,
[29:15.890 --> 29:20.410]  in November elections, if this passes, um,
[29:20.730 --> 29:25.330]  next year we might collect three and a half million, um,
[29:25.370 --> 29:30.050]  before October when this rule would kick in, but then that's it. Um,
[29:30.050 --> 29:33.330]  and so there's $5 million for the stuff in the County budget.
[29:33.330 --> 29:35.010]  We've slated to do with this money,
[29:35.050 --> 29:39.610]  like 1.3 million of it's going to the state fair to fix up, um,
[29:39.650 --> 29:42.010]  the ag building. Um,
[29:42.050 --> 29:47.130]  there's another 700,000 going for college scholarships
[29:47.130 --> 29:50.850]  here in Pueblo. So local high school kids, um,
[29:50.890 --> 29:52.570]  that are getting ready to graduate right now,
[29:52.570 --> 29:55.490]  if they want to go to one of the two colleges down here in Pueblo,
[29:55.890 --> 29:58.810]  they can apply for a marijuana scholarship. Um,
[29:58.850 --> 30:01.250]  and all of that money's coming from marijuana taxes.
[30:01.250 --> 30:03.170]  So we're sending kids to college with this money.
[30:03.210 --> 30:06.530]  Hashtag marijuana scholarship. That's all I've got to say about that.
[30:07.290 --> 30:12.010]  There's some middle school out in Pueblo West where it's just like the
[30:12.010 --> 30:16.850]  road, there's no sidewalk or gutter or anything that the kids walk on from their
[30:16.850 --> 30:20.450]  neighborhood to the school every day. And it's like crazy unsafe. Um,
[30:20.450 --> 30:24.650]  cause the buses that kids from a little further out or riding on or traveling on
[30:24.650 --> 30:27.490]  the street too, they're putting sidewalks in there with this money.
[30:27.490 --> 30:30.770]  Like we're doing shit that should have been done forever ago.
[30:31.130 --> 30:32.930]  That we couldn't afford to do. Um,
[30:32.930 --> 30:37.690]  and we're going to stop $5 million worth of that. Um, just overnight,
[30:38.610 --> 30:42.690]  maybe after this November's election, it's crazy to think about.
[30:43.330 --> 30:46.290]  So there's a lot of people fired up in Pueblo right now over this.
[30:47.290 --> 30:47.650]  That's,
[30:47.650 --> 30:51.450]  it would be ridiculous to put that many tax dollars in the,
[30:52.010 --> 30:55.050]  in the toilet and flush it down and put that many people out of employment.
[30:55.090 --> 30:56.850]  It would be stupid. I think, well,
[30:56.890 --> 30:58.890]  for something that's not causing any problems,
[30:59.010 --> 31:00.850]  particularly when you think about, you know,
[31:00.850 --> 31:04.290]  marijuana was here before it was legal and it's going to be here after it's,
[31:04.330 --> 31:08.170]  you know, even if they pass this, it's not going anywhere. Right.
[31:08.490 --> 31:11.250]  It just, all the benefits are going away. Yeah.
[31:11.370 --> 31:13.090]  And then the problems are going to compound.
[31:13.130 --> 31:16.610]  The growers that lose their jobs at the dispensaries are going to go grow the
[31:16.650 --> 31:19.570]  black market, grow the shit out of it, not pay taxes on it.
[31:19.610 --> 31:21.290]  Have people come in and go into their residence,
[31:21.290 --> 31:22.850]  create more traffic in your residence,
[31:23.090 --> 31:25.410]  have an illegal grow next door to your house,
[31:25.410 --> 31:27.610]  have people come into buy herb next door to your house.
[31:27.730 --> 31:30.650]  Well, that's what caught me. It is really bizarre about this,
[31:31.170 --> 31:35.450]  this effort to shut down the rec industry is that's where the benefits come
[31:35.450 --> 31:40.010]  from. Exactly. They, the, they're almost problem free, uh,
[31:40.050 --> 31:44.450]  in the entire run that Pueblo has done with marijuana shops, period.
[31:45.730 --> 31:49.370]  Um, all one license was rescinded kind of automatically.
[31:49.890 --> 31:54.250]  And then another license was the first dispensary in Colorado
[31:54.290 --> 31:58.250]  period to get shut down for regulatory infractions,
[31:58.250 --> 32:02.850]  not law violations or major rule breaking. They just, the regulations changed.
[32:02.850 --> 32:06.130]  They couldn't meet them fast enough. They got in trouble. Um,
[32:07.050 --> 32:10.170]  but that's been it. Like we don't cause crime.
[32:10.170 --> 32:14.650]  We don't have stuff going out the back door to some other place or state.
[32:15.050 --> 32:16.610]  We don't have teenagers shopping there.
[32:16.610 --> 32:19.770]  Like everybody down here in the legal industry follows the rules because we all
[32:19.770 --> 32:22.010]  want to be open next month. Um,
[32:22.010 --> 32:24.650]  and any small violation of the rules can cost you your license.
[32:24.650 --> 32:25.450]  It's just that simple.
[32:25.450 --> 32:29.810]  That's why you don't see big dispensaries screwing up in any major ways.
[32:30.250 --> 32:33.690]  It's because it's too expensive to risk screwing up. Yeah.
[32:33.770 --> 32:36.930]  And so you end up hiring three or four people to just run around all day and
[32:36.930 --> 32:40.450]  make sure everybody's complying with the rules. Um,
[32:41.730 --> 32:46.330]  the most of the problems these people have with legal marijuana have to do
[32:46.330 --> 32:50.690]  with, um, every other part of marijuana being legal,
[32:50.690 --> 32:55.170]  home grows where people can consume how people can consume,
[32:55.690 --> 32:59.570]  um, the variety of edible products, access to teenagers.
[32:59.570 --> 33:02.970]  Like none of that shit changes. If you get rid of rec, it all gets worse.
[33:03.090 --> 33:04.170]  Every bit of it gets worse.
[33:04.250 --> 33:09.050]  It's the County shops are doing like 1.7 to 2.5 million in sales every year.
[33:09.330 --> 33:10.850]  You figure half that's tourists.
[33:10.850 --> 33:14.290]  So you still got a million and a half going back into the ghetto.
[33:14.930 --> 33:16.810]  Like that's not a good thing.
[33:17.690 --> 33:21.810]  Like you don't want all of that business taking place in the house at the street
[33:21.850 --> 33:24.530]  because those are the ones that, uh,
[33:24.610 --> 33:27.370]  bad people with shotgun show up and try to rob hotels.
[33:27.370 --> 33:29.450]  They're going to lose money. Restaurants are going to lose money.
[33:29.450 --> 33:30.810]  The movie theater will lose money.
[33:30.810 --> 33:31.130]  Well, yeah,
[33:31.130 --> 33:34.410]  that's the other half of that money is all the people coming here for vacation.
[33:34.410 --> 33:37.690]  Now we were a spring break destination. Yeah. No one.
[33:37.690 --> 33:41.730]  I know they grew up here has ever had like a bunch of people in town for spring
[33:41.730 --> 33:46.370]  break. A lot of people came to town for spring break this year. It was weird.
[33:46.370 --> 33:48.570]  Yeah. It was really, um, you know,
[33:48.570 --> 33:53.490]  and then the thing is if they would turn a little different and promote that and
[33:53.490 --> 33:57.130]  cultivate that, then that could be huge next year. You know what I mean?
[33:57.130 --> 34:00.050]  And massive amount of tax dollars, right? Massive amounts.
[34:00.490 --> 34:04.730]  What do they make a year out there in Pueblo West and cannabis taxes? Um, uh,
[34:04.770 --> 34:09.050]  last year it was like 1.7 million. This next year it's going to be five,
[34:09.090 --> 34:13.130]  mainly because there's a new 3.5% tax on the production.
[34:13.130 --> 34:15.770]  So an excise tax, $5 million.
[34:15.810 --> 34:19.050]  Well, and they put in massive growth facilities. Do you know? Yeah.
[34:19.050 --> 34:22.010]  There's a huge expansion. And then, uh, the,
[34:22.130 --> 34:25.170]  we didn't have a special excise tax, just a special sales tax.
[34:25.210 --> 34:30.210]  Do you know by any random chance what Pueblo West's other tax income is like,
[34:30.810 --> 34:34.250]  what do they bring in other than, what's the number?
[34:34.250 --> 34:36.250]  Do you know their number minus cannabis taxes?
[34:36.290 --> 34:41.290]  We'll know the marijuana taxes represent like 2% at most of the County or the
[34:42.010 --> 34:44.490]  state. It doesn't make it sound so appealing.
[34:44.490 --> 34:48.290]  It is significantly more than alcohol though. Okay. Uh, no already.
[34:48.690 --> 34:52.090]  When you put it as a, uh, an overall percentage, it seems small,
[34:52.090 --> 34:55.850]  but when you look at the list of stuff that like we can't pay cops right now,
[34:55.850 --> 34:59.930]  like there isn't an extra 1% right. So when you got 5 million extra,
[34:59.930 --> 35:03.650]  you can maybe, and it's not so much extra at this point because
[35:04.890 --> 35:07.170]  it's the darkest fucking city I've ever driven through.
[35:07.330 --> 35:11.370]  They budgeted for it because it's going to come in this year. Um,
[35:11.410 --> 35:16.410]  and so funding got moved around and when the 5 million for marijuana,
[35:17.370 --> 35:20.490]  like if that doesn't come in because of this vote, um,
[35:20.530 --> 35:24.410]  all kinds of stuff isn't going to happen the year after that because of those
[35:24.410 --> 35:26.810]  cuts, it'll start to look like Detroit in a few years.
[35:27.850 --> 35:31.650]  I like you really can't Pueblo definitely can't afford to lose that kind of
[35:31.670 --> 35:34.690]  jobs. Like you see major articles in the chieftain,
[35:34.690 --> 35:38.490]  when the steel mill is off 200 people temporarily. Um,
[35:38.530 --> 35:41.810]  because the impact that the city feels when that happens is major.
[35:41.810 --> 35:46.530]  That's 200 paychecks. Um, if a thousand people say it's only 700,
[35:46.530 --> 35:49.890]  if 700 people stop bringing home paychecks because of this vote,
[35:50.610 --> 35:54.890]  like that's 700 fewer people that can order dinner, uh,
[35:54.930 --> 35:58.570]  have pizza delivered, go to the movies, go get another pair of sneakers,
[35:58.570 --> 36:01.810]  go get their kids school supplies, like their car, all of that stuff.
[36:01.850 --> 36:05.010]  It's 700 people that are going to be applying for food stamps. Yep.
[36:05.050 --> 36:08.650]  It's 700 people that are going to be going to food, unemployment,
[36:08.650 --> 36:09.570]  food pantries.
[36:09.930 --> 36:14.930]  It's 700 more stresses on an already overtaxed system of support in this
[36:15.650 --> 36:16.330]  community.
[36:16.330 --> 36:17.170]  In a small community.
[36:17.170 --> 36:19.290]  Pointless point. Yeah. It's,
[36:19.330 --> 36:22.530]  it's literally like 1% of the people in Pueblo County.
[36:22.530 --> 36:25.090]  Like there's 130 some thousand people down here.
[36:25.090 --> 36:27.250]  So it's like the worst type of self sabotage.
[36:27.330 --> 36:29.050]  Yeah. We really can't take it right.
[36:29.050 --> 36:33.690]  Like that. It really is. Nope. It's, it's, it's,
[36:34.090 --> 36:36.650]  you know, the reason I wanted to have this podcast,
[36:36.650 --> 36:41.650]  the reason I wanted to talk about this issue is I want everybody who supports
[36:41.810 --> 36:45.850]  cannabis to take it seriously because
[36:47.090 --> 36:50.810]  from my perspective on social media and out in the community,
[36:50.850 --> 36:55.130]  nobody's really taking it seriously. And that's, that frightens me to be honest.
[36:55.690 --> 37:00.050]  I don't think anybody took the idea that they could shut down cannabis in Pueblo
[37:00.050 --> 37:02.850]  West. Seriously. It doesn't seem like something feasible. Like, Oh,
[37:02.850 --> 37:06.570]  they can't do that. We voted, voted it in is what a lot of people say.
[37:06.890 --> 37:10.130]  And they just get it on the ballot. Nobody shows up. They can vote it right.
[37:10.130 --> 37:12.850]  They can vote it right out. Yeah. Just like we voted. Yeah.
[37:13.130 --> 37:16.690]  It's, it's a weird election to run this thing. It's, uh,
[37:16.970 --> 37:20.370]  the anti-pop people tend to be more conservative. Um,
[37:20.370 --> 37:25.090]  we just had a democratic president for eight years. No, uh,
[37:25.330 --> 37:27.490]  no, no stretch in American history.
[37:27.490 --> 37:31.650]  Have we had a two term president from one party or another followed by a
[37:31.650 --> 37:32.890]  president from that same party?
[37:33.490 --> 37:38.490]  So history tells us that more conservatives are going to turn out in this
[37:39.010 --> 37:42.530]  election than liberals to vote for president,
[37:42.890 --> 37:46.130]  which means they're going to be at the polls. Um,
[37:46.330 --> 37:51.090]  which means that if the youth vote and the pro cannabis vote don't come out in
[37:51.090 --> 37:53.810]  force this November, it's done. The legal.
[37:53.930 --> 37:55.570]  Well here locally,
[37:55.570 --> 37:59.970]  we could see the rec industry shut down and a lot of us would be out of work.
[37:59.970 --> 38:03.970]  And that would really suck. But there's four or five States that, um,
[38:04.010 --> 38:07.370]  at least that are legalizing that whole big list. We did. Um,
[38:07.410 --> 38:09.290]  not all of those efforts are going to make the ballot,
[38:09.290 --> 38:11.930]  but five to eight to 10 of them are going to.
[38:12.530 --> 38:15.490]  And if people don't show up and vote in those areas,
[38:15.530 --> 38:17.210]  those efforts are going to lose.
[38:17.690 --> 38:20.010]  And all of the people that say,
[38:20.090 --> 38:23.490]  or have been saying legalization is inevitable, um,
[38:23.530 --> 38:28.130]  are going to watch that tide turn and the pendulum is going to swing back the
[38:28.130 --> 38:30.690]  other way, just like it typically does in politics.
[38:31.210 --> 38:36.010]  And we're going to see States that have liberalized their marijuana lives start
[38:36.010 --> 38:39.330]  to go the other way again. And we don't want to see that.
[38:39.330 --> 38:42.650]  So everybody needs to figure out if you're registered to vote,
[38:43.210 --> 38:45.050]  figure out how to vote in your area,
[38:45.050 --> 38:49.730]  where to vote in your area and get on top of that and stay on top of that all
[38:49.730 --> 38:51.450]  the way through the election in November.
[38:53.050 --> 38:57.210]  Bam. I liked, uh, not just Pueblo West, everywhere, everywhere. It's,
[38:57.610 --> 39:00.770]  it's important to me locally because I could get fired in November and that
[39:00.770 --> 39:01.610]  would really suck.
[39:01.650 --> 39:03.770]  He's got a beautiful little boy that he's got to take care of.
[39:03.770 --> 39:04.690]  So keep Mike employed.
[39:04.690 --> 39:07.370]  I've got a nice little life going right now.
[39:07.370 --> 39:11.530]  And that's thanks in large part to the recreational industry in Pueblo County.
[39:11.770 --> 39:14.410]  Big shout out to the medical industry in Colorado spring.
[39:14.490 --> 39:16.490]  Right. We've all, or yeah,
[39:16.610 --> 39:20.090]  all of us are basically working in legal cannabis in one way or another.
[39:20.090 --> 39:24.970]  And if rec goes this year, I see a lot of the, the medical people like, well,
[39:24.970 --> 39:28.410]  you know, my shop will be doing better if right goes away. Yeah.
[39:28.410 --> 39:31.730]  For two years at most before this is an election again,
[39:31.730 --> 39:36.130]  when even fewer liberals turn out and because they managed to kill rec and
[39:36.130 --> 39:40.490]  Pueblo where it was so big last year, you're just going to be an easier target.
[39:40.930 --> 39:41.770]  Absolutely.
[39:42.570 --> 39:45.890]  And it's, if we can't get unified on this,
[39:45.930 --> 39:50.410]  it could get real ugly come November. And I really like my job people.
[39:51.330 --> 39:54.250]  Well, you know, you should run for some sort of office, bro.
[39:55.490 --> 39:58.890]  Can he be mayor? We don't have a mayor. I know, but I mean, you can be in,
[39:58.890 --> 40:00.090]  and it makes it so much easier.
[40:00.090 --> 40:03.130]  Mayor really has no power though. He needs to run for city council.
[40:03.490 --> 40:04.810]  That's a at large.
[40:04.850 --> 40:09.730]  You guys tweet, tweet Mike and encourage Mike to run for city council in the
[40:09.930 --> 40:10.770]  city of Pueblo.
[40:11.410 --> 40:14.050]  Lemon at large lemon at large. There we go.
[40:14.810 --> 40:19.810]  Lemon at large. You guys tweet him. It's at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter.
[40:20.130 --> 40:21.210]  Yep. That was correct.
[40:21.250 --> 40:25.210]  At Nemo punk 15 on Twitter, tweet him just hashtag lemon at large.
[40:25.290 --> 40:27.370]  I don't know if that's already a hashtag, but, uh,
[40:27.370 --> 40:29.690]  and then let him know that you're following him through the show.
[40:29.690 --> 40:32.730]  Follow my buddy, Mike. He's a great dude. He knows a lot about cannabis. Gary,
[40:32.730 --> 40:34.930]  do you have any social, I'm not wrapping up the show, but since I'm shy now,
[40:34.930 --> 40:37.530]  Mike, I feel like it's completely fair to give you a social media shout out.
[40:38.090 --> 40:40.770]  I know as you know, I've been recovering from a serious accident.
[40:40.850 --> 40:44.210]  Yes. It's good to see you back on your feet. All right. So, you know,
[40:44.210 --> 40:48.090]  this is kind of one of my first forays out. So welcome back to the table.
[40:49.050 --> 40:50.250]  You know, necessary trips.
[40:50.330 --> 40:51.410]  He's got like a, what is that?
[40:51.410 --> 40:55.050]  Like a, what I can see is probably a good four inch gash on your forehead.
[40:55.050 --> 40:57.050]  It goes all the way to the back. Oh my gosh.
[40:57.170 --> 41:01.170]  I had 47 stitches and 39 staples in my head.
[41:02.210 --> 41:07.210]  And I've also got a cracked cervical vertebrae and a torn rotator cuff.
[41:07.570 --> 41:11.050]  I haven't been even been addressed yet. And the accident was in December.
[41:11.530 --> 41:15.650]  So it's been a long recovery. Goddamn. Well, welcome back. Shit.
[41:16.130 --> 41:18.610]  I'm glad to be here. I didn't realize it was that bad through your Facebook.
[41:19.050 --> 41:21.410]  You know, you looked like a soldier on Facebook. I got in a wreck.
[41:21.410 --> 41:24.410]  I got a cool scar. I was like, damn, he got fucked up. Yeah.
[41:24.410 --> 41:26.810]  It's been pretty tough. Oh, glad you're all right, brother.
[41:26.850 --> 41:30.130]  And we're glad you're all right, man. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Shout out to your son.
[41:30.370 --> 41:34.130]  Oh, he's doing awesome. Straight A student. Yeah. Very proud of that.
[41:34.290 --> 41:36.770]  He's a bright kid. I like hanging out with him. Great kid. Yeah.
[41:36.770 --> 41:41.090]  Amazing. Forget that he's a kid sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. Really? Yeah. All right.
[41:41.090 --> 41:43.930]  Let's uh, no, no offense, but people don't want to hear about our kids.
[41:45.090 --> 41:49.690]  We should mention shout out to all the kids. Yeah. I hope they're not listening.
[41:50.090 --> 41:53.130]  Yeah. That's why I was going to reroute this. Yeah.
[41:53.450 --> 41:55.770]  But cause we really should touch on it.
[41:57.050 --> 42:00.490]  I think Mike's gotta go go, uh, cough up a dab. Yeah. Yeah.
[42:00.610 --> 42:03.370]  I was trying to find a classier way to say that, but why don't we break for a
[42:03.370 --> 42:06.210]  second? Okay. We're gonna take a quick break and then, uh, we'll be right back.
[42:06.210 --> 42:10.130]  You guys, I need a dab anyway. So we just got all high, you guys.
[42:10.130 --> 42:15.130]  And Gary decided that somebody needs to create an animated series based on my
[42:16.410 --> 42:20.370]  likeness. And there is a copyright on my likeness. So you guys can't fuck with this.
[42:20.370 --> 42:22.690]  I actually do have a trademark on my likeness.
[42:22.690 --> 42:24.570]  I'm not going to tell you the name of the company and everything,
[42:24.570 --> 42:27.090]  but that is patented. So don't try to fuck with my likeness or my name.
[42:27.410 --> 42:32.090]  But he just told me that I need to have a cartoon of myself and uh,
[42:32.090 --> 42:34.570]  I would have the lion of Judah as my sidekick.
[42:34.770 --> 42:37.170]  So it'd be Rasta Jeff and the lion Judah.
[42:37.170 --> 42:41.770]  And we'd be walking around solving cannabis related mysteries and or crimes.
[42:41.810 --> 42:44.930]  It would be awesome. But it wouldn't be like cannabis crimes. It would be like,
[42:44.930 --> 42:48.450]  you know, crimes against cannabis, I guess. Yeah. People,
[42:48.850 --> 42:53.570]  yo man, I see you spraying that shit on your plants while you're in flower boy.
[42:54.090 --> 42:58.050]  You can't do that to the plants when they're in flower. No,
[42:58.050 --> 43:00.690]  I'm not going to let them do it. If they give me some shitty Jamaican accent,
[43:01.530 --> 43:04.450]  Rasta Jeff. Would you want it to be me doing my own voice?
[43:04.450 --> 43:06.130]  I think so. Or would they hire like a voiceover?
[43:06.130 --> 43:09.330]  Do your own voice. Way more watchable if it's you. Yeah.
[43:10.010 --> 43:12.810]  Just your regular voice. And then, you know, we get a great, you know,
[43:12.850 --> 43:16.730]  sidekick character for the lion. It'd be perfect. Oh man.
[43:16.730 --> 43:20.010]  So if you want to audition to be the lion, send me an email.
[43:20.010 --> 43:21.530]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[43:21.970 --> 43:26.250]  Or if you want to produce a fucking Rasta Jeff themed cartoon, I am down as shit.
[43:26.290 --> 43:28.330]  Let's get it on. I want to see this happen.
[43:28.690 --> 43:31.090]  Shout out to Garrett Waller. You'd be a perfect dude.
[43:31.090 --> 43:33.690]  Oh man, Garrett Waller's funny as shit. He is.
[43:33.690 --> 43:37.770]  You gotta see if we got chemistry. It kind of looks like a lion. Yeah.
[43:37.770 --> 43:41.050]  Yeah. It's just a question of how many dabs. Right. Oh yeah.
[43:41.090 --> 43:43.570]  What's episode number one? What are we doing in episode number one?
[43:43.770 --> 43:45.850]  What's our mystery? If we were kind of, I'm seeing it.
[43:45.850 --> 43:48.850]  I'm envisioning us like as the ganja more and more obviously ganja.
[43:48.850 --> 43:51.970]  Rasta Jeff, some motherfucker sold me some bunk ass weed.
[43:52.090 --> 43:54.370]  I was thinking more like our plants got stolen.
[43:54.370 --> 43:58.010]  Help us find out who took them and then you track it back like up the road or
[43:58.010 --> 44:02.050]  whatever. I mean, you could, you could even go like fully educational and do
[44:02.050 --> 44:06.250]  like each episode is like a grow lesson. It's like, look, you've got,
[44:06.250 --> 44:10.490]  you've got mites. Rasta, Judith, do cloning.
[44:10.490 --> 44:15.490]  Yeah, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude,
[44:15.490 --> 44:19.530]  dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude,
[44:19.690 --> 44:22.690]  dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude,
[44:22.690 --> 44:26.250]  you could do it that way or you do it funny. I like the mystery solving thing,
[44:26.250 --> 44:27.290]  but you could go education.
[44:29.490 --> 44:32.650]  This was much more Scooby doo than it is.
[44:32.770 --> 44:36.610]  Like it's got an educational Rosenthal, but I think it could be both.
[44:36.690 --> 44:39.810]  It could definitely could. You should go watch the Mike Tyson mystery.
[44:39.850 --> 44:44.090]  So have you seen that? Hilarity? You, that's what I'm baking when I see this,
[44:44.290 --> 44:47.770]  okay. It's just replacing you. It's it's great dude. You'll like it.
[44:47.770 --> 44:53.490]  So if anybody wants to kind of replace the Mike Tyson mysteries with me and my lion Judah, I'm game
[44:53.490 --> 44:57.050]  I want to see it happen. I want to say I want to see me and I would like to see it fighting crime
[44:57.050 --> 44:59.490]  Can I be a superhero? Can we give me do I have a superpower?
[45:00.010 --> 45:03.810]  I'm just I think you got powers the plan fixer. I can talk to play
[45:03.810 --> 45:07.570]  That's the thing about cartoons. No plan to whisper as you can have powers, you know
[45:08.250 --> 45:14.130]  Yeah, because they don't have to be Judah can certainly have powers. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I like that version better
[45:14.930 --> 45:20.090]  Where you can be super high and the lion can be a superhero, right? I don't want to be tally
[45:20.090 --> 45:22.690]  I think that the whole thing is it's easy to be tally
[45:22.690 --> 45:25.730]  I think there'd be like a whole question of whether the line is real or not
[45:26.450 --> 45:31.050]  You know what? I mean? So it's kind of Wilfred like now sudden. I was just about to say don't go Wilfred
[45:31.050 --> 45:33.850]  No, no, not that far. But you know, I mean, he's your sidekick
[45:34.490 --> 45:40.010]  But you know suddenly he's only there when I'm blazed. That's we don't ever
[45:40.650 --> 45:47.450]  Show me smoking or talk about me smoking, but only when I'm obviously high Judah shows up Judah. We need your help. Yeah
[45:52.530 --> 45:54.710]  Question that I don't know the answer to him like I don't know
[45:54.710 --> 45:58.770]  Let me go find Judah and then I come back with Judah and I've got the answer but those
[45:59.450 --> 46:06.770]  Elements like the 70 show element the Mike Tyson mysteries element and the Scooby-Doo elements if you could you know work those in
[46:06.810 --> 46:08.810]  We'll make it even funnier
[46:08.810 --> 46:12.610]  These are hashtag they like it when we ramble. Yes. All right, you guys
[46:16.290 --> 46:21.570]  No, I'm not editing that's beautiful this is podcasting at its finest welcome to the table you guys
[46:21.570 --> 46:23.750]  This is what three dudes that have had too many dabs
[46:24.170 --> 46:27.490]  Sit around and talk about too many not just too many
[46:27.490 --> 46:30.890]  I could probably go for one more but I don't want to blow out the throat and try to record but that
[46:32.530 --> 46:34.530]  Once you guys get talking I might take a dab
[46:34.650 --> 46:39.370]  So recently the DEA has announced that they are going to
[46:40.370 --> 46:47.730]  Investigate cannabis a little further and within 90 days. They will release their opinion on it rather they decide to
[46:48.530 --> 46:53.370]  Reschedule cannabis as a schedule. I have an article on the thing here. So I'm no good with the scheduling
[46:53.370 --> 46:56.450]  I get the numbers mixed up. They're going to reschedule cannabis
[46:57.090 --> 47:02.690]  Right now is it is currently listed as a schedule one drug meaning that for the purposes of federal law
[47:02.690 --> 47:09.250]  The drug has no medical value and a high potential for abuse and is one of the most dangerous drugs of all drug schedules with
[47:09.450 --> 47:11.050]  potentially severe
[47:11.050 --> 47:13.050]  psychological or physical
[47:13.090 --> 47:17.810]  Dependence. Okay that right there poses a really big problem for the government
[47:18.250 --> 47:24.650]  Yes, because a different branch of the government owns a patent for medical uses of cannabis
[47:24.970 --> 47:28.570]  So, how can it have no medical uses and you own the patent?
[47:28.570 --> 47:32.650]  They've been comfortable with that bit of hypocrisy for a really long time but
[47:33.250 --> 47:38.010]  There's a case working its way through the courts that is challenging that very issue
[47:38.010 --> 47:42.290]  Yep, that one of them has basically been waiting for a decade to see this
[47:42.690 --> 47:47.570]  Commission so there this move is ahead of it and my initial
[47:48.490 --> 47:50.490]  thought on this move
[47:50.810 --> 47:55.690]  Was this is an establishment Democrat move to take some wind out of Bernie Sanders
[47:56.410 --> 47:59.690]  If if they reschedule before the election
[48:00.930 --> 48:07.290]  That kind of removes a key issue for Sanders the reason we highlighted Sanders on this podcast
[48:08.290 --> 48:10.290]  You see what I mean?
[48:10.330 --> 48:13.050]  As an establishment Democrat move
[48:13.850 --> 48:15.850]  It's kind of brilliant
[48:16.650 --> 48:21.810]  See I was just expecting the DEA to swat this down like they have every time but because they've
[48:22.530 --> 48:24.530]  We've gotten to this point in
[48:25.090 --> 48:27.490]  The DEA trying to reschedule it before
[48:28.050 --> 48:33.250]  True and honestly, I haven't kept up as much as I should have with this current incarnation of it
[48:33.250 --> 48:35.530]  But I would be surprised if that
[48:36.650 --> 48:42.610]  But it could be I don't know. So you think they're giving up the Queen to save the king? Well look
[48:43.850 --> 48:45.690]  Socially the tide has turned
[48:45.690 --> 48:50.330]  Everybody knows that yes, it's just a matter of with the number of states that have legalized
[48:50.850 --> 48:53.290]  All of the things that are changing it is definitely obvious
[48:53.690 --> 48:59.890]  We've seen the DNC the Democratic establishment do all kinds of shit to Sanders
[49:00.330 --> 49:04.970]  You know what? I mean? It kind of fits the profile. I'm not trying to be a conspiracy theorist
[49:04.970 --> 49:08.210]  I just see a massive political value
[49:09.210 --> 49:11.210]  for Hillary Clinton
[49:11.210 --> 49:13.050]  If it happens before the election
[49:13.050 --> 49:18.610]  There's a huge political value for her if it happens before the election and that's undeniable
[49:18.610 --> 49:22.450]  I can see that. All right, so whether it's intentional or unintentional now, I
[49:23.050 --> 49:25.530]  Agree with Mike. I think that in
[49:26.890 --> 49:34.410]  Under normal circumstances, this is just the DA is gonna you know shuffle some papers around and fuck you this bullshit
[49:34.690 --> 49:38.330]  they've literally been taken to federal court and lost and
[49:39.410 --> 49:41.410]  Still not still
[49:41.730 --> 49:47.970]  Right there their own DEA law judge like when they the original federal medical
[49:48.330 --> 49:50.330]  program was created
[49:50.330 --> 49:52.530]  two citizens sued the feds one
[49:53.650 --> 49:56.610]  And then the DEA law judge that overheard the case
[49:56.890 --> 50:02.330]  Recommended that the DEA reschedule marijuana and their response was to basically shame him into retirement
[50:02.610 --> 50:03.130]  well
[50:03.130 --> 50:08.570]  but and what what you have to understand and what we all have to acknowledge here is that
[50:09.090 --> 50:12.010]  They are fully under the control of the executive branch
[50:12.210 --> 50:16.770]  So the president ordered them to do that or they wouldn't have done it period
[50:17.330 --> 50:20.490]  Like if the president ordered them not to do it
[50:20.490 --> 50:26.770]  They wouldn't have done more than likely more than likely and and and you know all probabilities. Okay, so
[50:27.690 --> 50:33.170]  That's the difference right now. So the the implications are really weird, right?
[50:33.490 --> 50:36.890]  so they have several options they could do nothing and and
[50:38.290 --> 50:40.370]  Very possibly they they could do nothing
[50:40.370 --> 50:44.990]  That's basically what I expected to see happen was this to come up again and then to say
[50:45.310 --> 50:51.630]  Yeah, no and that could happen that could be the answer right and that's that tends to be the federal response when it comes to
[50:51.630 --> 50:53.630]  Marijuana is right
[50:53.790 --> 50:58.110]  Shake their head and say no and if things go on the way they have under normal circumstances
[50:58.270 --> 51:03.830]  That's what we would all expect would they have even bothered to announce it if they weren't gonna do something
[51:03.830 --> 51:06.870]  They didn't have to tell us. It's true. That's the thing
[51:06.870 --> 51:13.910]  I mean the pressure though the story that I did glance at I don't think they announced it quite as
[51:13.990 --> 51:20.950]  Intentional like they didn't mean for this to happen. I'm because a number of different news agencies are talking about it. Somebody had like a
[51:22.270 --> 51:24.790]  Forwarded the wrong email to the wrong person
[51:25.750 --> 51:30.590]  And now we're gonna be looking at this between now and what is it August? Yeah
[51:31.990 --> 51:36.470]  Memo was leaked to I want to say it was Matt for near but I'm not positive
[51:38.350 --> 51:40.350]  And so yeah, I'm not sure that this was a
[51:41.110 --> 51:47.150]  Intended to be as public publicized as it has been but who knows they the shit gets leaked on purpose to yes
[51:47.710 --> 51:50.450]  Exactly. Well, thanks to whoever leaked it material
[51:50.910 --> 51:56.590]  They could have leaked it to you know, kind of test public sentiment on it, you know, right how it's gonna fly
[51:56.750 --> 51:59.350]  Yeah, like a comedian tweets a joke. That's what they do
[51:59.350 --> 52:05.550]  You know just tweeted the joke if they do nothing then you know, we're where we are. Nothing changes except
[52:05.990 --> 52:12.630]  That whoever the next president is then has the authority to come and shut all this shit down if they want to
[52:13.510 --> 52:15.510]  under federal law and
[52:16.470 --> 52:21.950]  Don't kid yourself Trump will do that his whole campaign sparks of that man, you know, no, it's
[52:22.750 --> 52:27.430]  Whole campaign is insane. It doesn't surprise me that you're having Trump nightmares
[52:31.350 --> 52:33.350]  All right, so
[52:33.790 --> 52:40.270]  The DEA could possibly come out and say hey this does have medicinal value we could yeah. All right. So yeah
[52:40.750 --> 52:47.030]  So option one do nothing and that's probably what the consensus what everybody expects, right?
[52:47.430 --> 52:49.430]  But option two is they reschedule?
[52:50.150 --> 52:56.750]  Which means it goes somewhere between two and five on the on the schedule right list. Okay, and
[52:58.310 --> 53:01.270]  That puts it under the jurisdiction of the FDA
[53:01.910 --> 53:05.670]  So now if it's scheduled anywhere below one
[53:06.190 --> 53:12.750]  It's under FDA. So what does that mean? Well, even if it drops the two a lot of good things
[53:13.510 --> 53:20.070]  Happen a lot of good things a lot of strange things happen because I mean we've spent an amazingly long time
[53:20.230 --> 53:22.910]  Trying to figure out how to make it too punitive
[53:23.470 --> 53:28.270]  For people to risk smoking or having weed and all of those rules are still in place
[53:28.270 --> 53:31.750]  All of those rules are still in place even in places like Colorado so
[53:32.790 --> 53:37.830]  Rescheduling it anywhere on the schedule still leaves some really interesting questions. It really really does
[53:37.830 --> 53:42.790]  Well, like I said in putting it anywhere on the schedule makes it under the authority of the FDA
[53:42.830 --> 53:47.630]  so that leaves a whole bunch of questions of how and
[53:47.990 --> 53:50.470]  You know, how how would that even begin to work?
[53:50.470 --> 53:56.190]  But it's not a typical pharmaceutical what I predicted me. I don't know if I've said this on an episode before what I predict
[53:56.710 --> 54:01.590]  Unfortunately, maybe if we do go to a national I thought it would be medical first
[54:01.590 --> 54:06.650]  But it looks like we may have a national recreational program. We've already done that they'll find somebody
[54:07.670 --> 54:13.750]  Right. Okay. Holy shit. You're correct. We have they're gonna find somebody to grow it and then it's not gonna be something friendly
[54:13.750 --> 54:18.870]  It's gonna be a mass-produced product that is gonna be and they're gonna wipe out all the small grows like what we've got going now
[54:18.870 --> 54:21.390]  See, it's it's it's just not happening. It's not
[54:22.390 --> 54:26.670]  Happening that way, you know what I mean? That's a top-down kind of
[54:27.430 --> 54:28.990]  affectation a political
[54:28.990 --> 54:34.610]  Change right and it's not having it's happening from the bottom up on the state level a third option
[54:34.610 --> 54:39.550]  They have rather than rescheduling they could delist it. They could deschedule completely and
[54:40.110 --> 54:44.250]  And they could even go so far as to recommend that you know
[54:45.710 --> 54:49.590]  Although it's delisted and not a scheduled drug
[54:50.310 --> 54:57.750]  That it needs special care so the ATF could become the ATFC I mean literally
[54:59.790 --> 55:02.930]  Marijuana instead of cannabis in their acronym. I wish they wouldn't but
[55:03.790 --> 55:07.830]  That's totally on the list of possibilities. Well and and
[55:08.830 --> 55:16.430]  some of the analysis that I read the policy analysis that if you look at you know, kind of the recent history of
[55:17.270 --> 55:22.950]  Structuring government this would probably be the way they would do it because of
[55:23.950 --> 55:25.950]  integration with like
[55:27.070 --> 55:28.710]  Homeland Security
[55:28.710 --> 55:33.670]  ATF has already fully integrated and so in this transition period
[55:34.670 --> 55:36.670]  Where we're going from illegal to legal
[55:37.190 --> 55:43.670]  the ATF would be able to monitor the legal grows and keep out cartels and stuff like that and
[55:44.150 --> 55:49.350]  Then their role would diminish as it has with alcohol, you know, the ATF was heavy in
[55:50.110 --> 55:55.590]  Regulation when alcohol first became legal and then they've you know eased off on alcohol, right?
[55:57.030 --> 55:59.470]  This point it's just regulated like anything else
[55:59.470 --> 56:06.130]  The state regulatory agency has inspectors the inspectors come by and check stuff with something like this
[56:06.130 --> 56:11.190]  It's a retail distributed intoxicant like there'd be the occasional ID sting
[56:11.190 --> 56:16.990]  But it's really not that complicated to turn it into a product just like anything else exactly and and that's what?
[56:17.550 --> 56:23.990]  Descheduling it and putting it under the ATF jurisdiction would do and it would solve the government's problem worry about cartels getting in
[56:23.990 --> 56:27.870]  And stuff like that because then they could go to every state and inspect them
[56:28.430 --> 56:33.070]  Right, I mean, yeah and without even having to put any regulations on it
[56:33.070 --> 56:37.670]  You know, just just looking for money laundering and tax evasion and stuff like that
[56:38.310 --> 56:41.910]  Like they do with the ATF does with alcohol they only do the top-level
[56:43.390 --> 56:49.390]  Do you think anybody else has thought this idea through or do you think this is something you just make this shit up
[56:49.390 --> 56:53.430]  You know, I went out and read smarter people than me and this is what they think
[56:53.430 --> 57:01.450]  I think the odds of them descheduling cannabis in the next couple months is around like one or two or three percent at most
[57:02.830 --> 57:07.430]  If the DEA does anything it will likely be lower the schedule
[57:08.270 --> 57:11.950]  a point or two so down to schedule two or three which I
[57:12.550 --> 57:18.430]  Mean we can debate for a really long time if it belongs on the schedule at all or and if so where?
[57:18.990 --> 57:23.390]  but I really don't think the DEA is gonna do anything because that's
[57:23.870 --> 57:29.710]  Historically what they've always done is just nothing. Well, and the marijuana is too big a piece of the the
[57:30.310 --> 57:32.030]  drug war pie
[57:32.030 --> 57:36.470]  We're 80% of all drug can see all illicit drug consumers only consume cannabis
[57:36.790 --> 57:42.670]  You take cannabis out of that equation and they've got a real hard time justifying a lot of their budgets true
[57:43.230 --> 57:48.750]  And that's why they spend so many times flying around or so much time flying around shopping down cannabis plants in the woods
[57:50.550 --> 57:55.510]  Like it's because they if they don't they don't get paid and like
[57:56.350 --> 58:03.250]  So if they do federally regulate it to another schedule is my gonna have to become a pharmacist basically now to be a bud tender
[58:03.250 --> 58:05.250]  am I gonna have to wear a lab coat and
[58:05.870 --> 58:13.110]  Go a little bit more extreme and get major some sort of pharmaceutical. It wouldn't change state laws accreditation. I think
[58:14.110 --> 58:17.510]  It wouldn't change state laws, but it would give the FDA
[58:18.070 --> 58:20.710]  It opportunity to basically do whatever they want
[58:21.710 --> 58:23.710]  I'm
[58:24.470 --> 58:28.790]  Depending on where it falls on the schedule bud tending would still be a federal offense
[58:31.390 --> 58:33.390]  And
[58:33.630 --> 58:38.870]  But even if it moved to just schedule to the ability for doctors to research it
[58:39.950 --> 58:46.190]  Would increase greatly like one of the main hurdles right now is like if you get your whole study approved
[58:46.550 --> 58:49.590]  There's only one small place where you can get the cannabis from
[58:50.350 --> 58:55.510]  If you watch Sanjay Gupta's marijuana specials, you can check out where that place is and what it's all about
[58:56.430 --> 59:01.870]  But the supply is still drastically limited and with the number of different compounds in the cannabis plant
[59:02.590 --> 59:04.270]  the number of different
[59:04.270 --> 59:11.430]  Medical applications that people in our industry have seen hinted at but would like for the research on all of those studies get a lot
[59:11.430 --> 59:14.530]  Easier to do. Oh, yeah, even if it only moves
[59:15.670 --> 59:18.270]  If it only moves to two it opens up
[59:19.270 --> 59:24.590]  Everything okay. Yeah everything as far as research goes. Yeah, that door really opens
[59:24.590 --> 59:29.830]  Would we be able to study cannabis at the University of Southern Colorado Apollo Colorado State University?
[59:30.750 --> 59:32.630]  Okay. All right
[59:32.630 --> 59:33.790]  Yep
[59:33.790 --> 59:37.550]  And I mean, I really don't think that he is gonna move on this
[59:38.590 --> 59:43.550]  If the federal government moves in my opinion it will because an acting president
[59:44.550 --> 59:50.110]  Rallies Congress just like they do on countless other issues using the bully pulpit
[59:51.150 --> 59:54.670]  and it will be a long drawn-out process is my opinion, but
[59:55.310 --> 59:58.870]  Who knows the DEA could jump for all kinds of reasons? Well
[59:59.870 --> 01:00:04.350]  The analysis that I read and this was policy analysis from Pew
[01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:06.710]  researchers
[01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:09.670]  you know their take on it is
[01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:12.910]  Right now nobody knows what's going on
[01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:15.390]  in this election cycle
[01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:20.830]  That you know, basically everybody's pulling out all the stops and all bets are off, right?
[01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:24.630]  And that you know the benefit here, you know in this in this situation
[01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:30.470]  For Clinton could could be the tipping point could be the thing that does after all these fucking years
[01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:35.830]  You know what? I mean? And and you know sadly he gave about five examples
[01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:38.590]  That's how shit works in this country
[01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:46.830]  You know what I mean, unfortunately, you know, there's there's enough support out there that it could get done without too much turmoil
[01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:54.470]  Now, you know, yeah, it could fly you could do it and we've seen Obama's a lame-duck. He's got nothing to lose
[01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:58.310]  True. He's on his way out. He is doors about to close on his ass
[01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:05.750]  They've never said a nice word about him before. Why did he doesn't give a fuck what the opponents think true? So, you know
[01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.310]  It we were talking about two election
[01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:11.950]  vote
[01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:13.150]  situations where
[01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:14.430]  about a hundred people
[01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:18.670]  voiced their concern on one way and two or three people stood up and voiced their concern on the
[01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:23.630]  Opposition and for some reason the council members went with the lower votes in both cases
[01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:29.750]  Was in Colorado Springs recently on two very different issues very different issues, but it went the same damn way
[01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:36.830]  Well, we're seeing we're seeing here in Southern Colorado. We're seeing the culture war like really starting to bubble up, you know
[01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:38.830]  we're seeing this movement this
[01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:46.270]  Whatever it is movement against marijuana. We're seeing the City Council and Colorado Springs taking all kinds of actions
[01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:53.510]  That are just really opposed to public outcry and like one of those is on marijuana
[01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:58.350]  But there were other issues like completely unrelated to marijuana where the public was, you know
[01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:03.830]  Really vocal on it and they still moved like directly against right away and with the other way and
[01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:07.790]  It's you know, it's
[01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:13.750]  It's getting thick around here man. And and you know, it's kind of getting thick nationally too, right and
[01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:16.870]  You know was I mean
[01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:22.310]  Politics goes in cycles. I mean pull out a history book or just if you're older think back
[01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:27.950]  It goes liberal conservative liberal conservative and it has for the last hundred years
[01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.870]  Well, and we saw Reagan
[01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:36.330]  True but it's getting more and more
[01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:41.750]  Conservative right now because it got more and more liberal for a minute
[01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:45.110]  We made some nice progress on some nice issues
[01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:48.990]  But at the same time the conservative folks the anti pot groups
[01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:53.510]  they've been getting clobbered in election after election and
[01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:58.830]  Council meeting after council meeting and license hearing after license hearing and they're pissed
[01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:06.390]  So down here they're going with the nuclear option and it kind of seems like they are nationally to
[01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:10.390]  given Trump's popularity, yeah, but
[01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:18.950]  If if more people don't get active and I mean that takes paying attention it takes some dedication it takes reading the news
[01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:22.830]  Occasionally it takes staying informed
[01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:26.390]  it's not something that you can just do overnight, but
[01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:29.150]  if more people our age and
[01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:35.230]  More people that aren't into cannabis don't start getting involved like it could get real ugly for the next couple of years
[01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:37.350]  eight years at least
[01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:44.030]  Register and vote register and vote the I was gonna I was gonna say the ball is in your hands, but that just sounds gross
[01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:51.190]  Voter conscience on the presidential candidate, but support the cannabis industry. Yes, please do absolutely
[01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:57.350]  Everyone at this table relies heavily in the cannabis industry the legal cannabis industry. That's something I want to add
[01:03:57.350 --> 01:04:01.790]  I come from the black market. I come from the dark side of this industry
[01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:05.470]  If there weren't a legal cannabis market, you know where I would be
[01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:10.370]  You'd probably still be part of the black one. I'd be crushing the black market just like I used to do
[01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:15.510]  Yeah, yep, and now that I've got a legitimate job. I pay a lot of damn taxes
[01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:19.030]  I have a time clock now. I'm doing everything legit
[01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:23.790]  I've got we got manifests and invoices for every gram of product I produce now
[01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:30.950]  It's I watched it happen. I I spent a lot of time kind of in the gray world working for caregivers and
[01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:33.830]  one by one the
[01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.690]  Dried up because it was too much of a hassle now
[01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:42.350]  There's not enough profit in Colorado because most of that's going to legal market now Mike and I got to watch
[01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.710]  The whole thing shift. Yep
[01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:46.750]  You want
[01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:52.390]  The street to the caregiver model to the kind of a dispensary to the sketchy ass dispensary to the okay
[01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:54.950]  That's a dispensary to holy shit. This is right
[01:04:58.350 --> 01:04:59.830]  Clubs yeah
[01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:04.230]  Yeah, so shout out to all the people and this is mainly all of the mics out there
[01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:06.550]  Mike is part of a team. I'm part of a team
[01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:09.430]  I get all the glory because I've got a show with my face on the fucking label
[01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:13.750]  I've got a seed company that I hype a lot. I've got the Instagram that everybody checks out. I'm the voice
[01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:18.310]  I'm the face, but there are for every one of me. There are three or four people supporting what I do
[01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:20.430]  I know that it's not just me that's able to do it
[01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:22.310]  So I'm gonna give Mike a fist bump because he's the closest one to me
[01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:26.070]  But that fist bump is for all the people that make this shit possible because it's not just a one-man effort
[01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:31.830]  I get all the Facebook and Instagram love but it's all you guys also so no, we're yeah
[01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:36.190]  We're a huge community guys. Don't get it organized Mike's been there since the beginning with me
[01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:40.710]  Fucking Mike help me try to spend a lot of years back in the day
[01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:46.310]  Back in the way day. Do you remember when your girl room was like?
[01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:55.610]  Remember when it was three foot by three foot buddy. Yeah. Uh-huh. I remember when you could bake potatoes on the floor that bitch
[01:05:56.550 --> 01:05:59.910]  We probably tried in the learning days the learning days were fun
[01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:05.190]  Yeah, a lot of a lot of years of experience a lot of battles that were fought
[01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:09.590]  I mean years before the show started going to making it and giving you guys
[01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:13.070]  I mean law decades worth of lessons
[01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:16.910]  If you're still listening like yeah, I had to fail
[01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:19.750]  I had to fail a thousand times to learn the hundred things that I learned
[01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:27.150]  I mean it feels so many times I had to sit through hundreds ounces hours of council meetings hundred ounces hundred hundred ounce council meetings
[01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:29.990]  hundreds of hours
[01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:32.950]  Watching the process happen. Yeah
[01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:37.170]  Watching we went to our friends or I happen. Yep
[01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:43.030]  Conviction on cultivation of a large farm when supported that and learned a lot
[01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:48.210]  Yep, I mean just going through and watching it took up. I mean hundreds of hours
[01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:54.630]  It just so that now that all of this is going down. We can be active in it like it takes work
[01:06:55.230 --> 01:07:01.350]  But come from the dark side you guys come into the the legal regulated market pay some taxes much better, bro
[01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:05.270]  Now I was able to go to a car dealership and they're like so what do you do for work?
[01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:08.390]  I was like I have a pay stub and I work at a legitimate place and they're like
[01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:11.710]  Oh, we'll give you a fat credit instead of like what do you do? I'm gonna pay cash
[01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:13.710]  Can I just buy a car and looking sketchy?
[01:07:13.790 --> 01:07:18.110]  Like it felt way better just walk in there and be like look I have like a real line of work
[01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:23.590]  It felt really nice. So just come from the dark side join the regulated market get legit
[01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:28.870]  Don't hide don't have to look over your shoulder all the time. Don't be a eyesore on the movement. Well, I see people
[01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:36.510]  There'll be a legalization effort running in their area and they'll be fighting it because it's not enough in their eyes
[01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:42.750]  And if you look at Colorado's rules and how it all hashed out like it's not enough in our eyes
[01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:45.390]  We didn't get clubs
[01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:50.470]  Clubs are a big issue, but they're not even close to the only issue. We I mean, it's it's not enough yet
[01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:57.990]  It's just not but the reality of the situation is it's the best scenario anyone's got on the planet by miles
[01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:04.390]  There are a couple of states coming up behind us that might end up in similar positions cannabis wise
[01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:10.990]  But is a consumer is a patient as a member of the community like I can't see it getting
[01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:13.590]  Much better than this right now
[01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:19.070]  Not for us the only thing that can really improve for us is pricing
[01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:24.110]  And that that comes in time. We watch that happen with the medical market. It just takes time
[01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:26.070]  As
[01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:32.950]  More states legalizes the tourism industry dips down a little bit is more shops open as competition gets better
[01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:34.950]  Is talent people become more talented?
[01:08:36.230 --> 01:08:39.750]  There's a lot of brother-in-laws that got hired to grow a lot of warehouse weed
[01:08:40.710 --> 01:08:46.190]  And it didn't come out so hot for some of them. Well, yeah growers still tend to be a problem for dispensers
[01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:49.750]  I want to predict a cannabis shortage this summer
[01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:54.930]  It it's been happening this state estimates were a ton or more under
[01:08:56.150 --> 01:09:01.070]  Consumption for our production right now, so we're not even close to meeting demand. Can I bust out a humble brag?
[01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:08.510]  I run an 80 we have 85. Oh, I heard these no 85 lights in the flowering room and I pulled
[01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:10.910]  200 and I think
[01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:14.590]  217 ish pounds is what I think I remember reading Wow. Yeah
[01:09:15.190 --> 01:09:21.110]  217 and a half pounds or something. I saw your boss similar to that social media. Yeah, I don't remember the exact number because
[01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:28.870]  Yeah, I remember thinking 237 with that might just be a number I made up my head that sounds close so somewhere around there
[01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:29.990]  Yeah
[01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:33.390]  Yeah, I could go look but I'm it's I'm high as shit
[01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:34.470]  So that number has gone in my head
[01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:40.470]  But yeah between 215 and 230 something pounds of usable cannabis underneath 85 lights
[01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:42.830]  We pulled about two point two
[01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:48.990]  Pounds per light is what I think we math that out. Maybe 2.5 or something like that is what I did the math on so
[01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:55.070]  Yeah, I'll do what I can to produce those tonnages of cannabis that we need for the summer you guys
[01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:58.470]  But I can't promise you that it'll all be out there and see everybody got to do their part
[01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:02.690]  Push out to something pounds from 85 lights
[01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:03.950]  That should be inspiring
[01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:09.910]  Like just look at the table for a second and then think back to 10 years ago because that's where they are in, Louisiana
[01:10:10.150 --> 01:10:15.830]  Texas New York. Yeah, I mean countless other states. So they're where we are 10 or 15 years ago
[01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:17.270]  I'm gonna give them five or six years
[01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:22.230]  I don't know about 10 a lot of the dab thing is catching on the internet moves us more quickly and people travel a lot
[01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:26.590]  more and I'm gonna blame a lot of things on the traveling of
[01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:31.950]  Jam bands and the music scene when widespread goes on tour. They're gonna stop
[01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:36.710]  I think they're in Austin this week people that traveled from Colorado to Austin are introduced
[01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:41.590]  I'm sure Austin's already got dads and shit, but they're introducing more people to shatter right now
[01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:48.690]  After the widespread show right now some of that's made it out. But like law wise what happens if you get caught with it?
[01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:54.390]  Like in Ohio or a number of those middle states that nobody thinks about a lot
[01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:57.430]  Sorry, Ohio
[01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:59.550]  but there's there's a lot of states where
[01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:06.430]  Having cannabis is a major offense. It doesn't matter if you're sick. It doesn't matter if you have cancer
[01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:12.750]  It doesn't matter if you've got Crohn's disease, they'll take your kids. They'll take your house. Shout out to my crew from Ohio
[01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:17.830]  Listen, but I got a crew that's not from Ohio that listen. So shout out to all them kids
[01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:22.270]  Magoo, what up brother? Like when I was in Louisiana a year ago
[01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:25.590]  I watched somebody get like grabbed and thrown to the ground for smoking a joint
[01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:29.710]  Yeah handcuffed and thrown the back of a squad car like in Party City
[01:11:30.190 --> 01:11:31.670]  Yeah
[01:11:31.670 --> 01:11:37.670]  It's no joke a lot of places in the laws move slow, Louisiana just changed their laws though, and it's a
[01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:40.630]  Interesting. They seem to be on the road to legalization
[01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:45.590]  very very slowly well, they the current regs are
[01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:53.870]  Up to two and a half pounds is a misdemeanor. Oh your possession and a transfer of up to an ounce to another adult is a misdemeanor
[01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:58.290]  They've got one of the worst three strikes laws in the country though
[01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:02.590]  But you can pretty much walk out of their jail from what I've seen on YouTube
[01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:05.550]  You pretty much just get up and leave if you feel like
[01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:12.910]  Yeah, it's it's not something you want to play with in a lot of places and the laws slow to change
[01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:17.910]  Sorry to cough into the microphone you guys dad's are happening here rigs going back around
[01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:22.030]  Yeah, Mike you got skipped cuz you cough a lot, but I'm gonna give you one as we start wrapping up the show
[01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:24.830]  It'll come back this way. There we go. Don't take it personally
[01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:30.270]  Never do hashtag we like it when they like it when we I forgot it is I like it when you ramble
[01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:40.050]  Kind of a crazy show we've gone some weird places. Yeah, we're almost an hour and we're over an hour and ten minutes in so
[01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:43.710]  Anybody have anything important they want to wrap up a podcast with?
[01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:48.470]  How about everybody make their prediction for the election
[01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:55.390]  Who'll be the nominee for it is too early for that shit with this we're on preseason you can't make me call the Super Bowl
[01:12:56.230 --> 01:12:58.230]  Who do you think will be the nominees?
[01:12:58.950 --> 01:13:04.390]  That that's still too early to call. Yeah, I don't think they're gonna give it to Trump. I really don't I really don't
[01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:12.450]  I'm waiting to see the country flip out when the guy who gets the most votes doesn't get the nomination because
[01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:14.870]  Dude, you can't put the crazy person
[01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:17.270]  in the room with the button
[01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:19.790]  It's
[01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:24.790]  There's no way the RNC lets that happen, but assholes they're fucking
[01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:29.510]  Anti-american in my opinion, but they're not that fucking stupid. No if it
[01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:35.710]  They're not at the same point. They haven't put to put forward a contender Trump a Trump presidency
[01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:42.930]  Creates so much uncertainty our economy. Thank you. This is they've been stepping to step into the right
[01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:48.850]  Big step by big step for the last 20 years and this is what happens when you step off the cliff at the end of
[01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:50.850]  the red side
[01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:57.890]  Yeah, it's a problem yeah, I usually keep my mouth shut politics
[01:13:58.690 --> 01:14:00.690]  but if
[01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:04.770]  If Trump is afraid of Megyn Kelly, how is he gonna fucking deal with Isis?
