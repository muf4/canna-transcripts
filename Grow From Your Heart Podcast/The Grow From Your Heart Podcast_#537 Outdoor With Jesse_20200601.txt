[00:07.600 --> 00:10.560]  Sitting across from me is the legend, Jesse is back.
[00:10.560 --> 00:11.560]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:11.560 --> 00:12.560]  Hey, what's up, everyone?

[00:54.160 --> 00:55.160]  It was perfect.
[00:55.160 --> 00:56.880]  It's all printed in my brain now.
[00:56.880 --> 00:57.880]  One take.

[01:01.000 --> 01:02.640]  I just want to throw that out there.

[01:03.640 --> 01:04.640]  Big shout out to my friend James Bean.
[01:04.640 --> 01:05.800]  Also, big shout out to Rob Beans.
[01:05.800 --> 01:07.880]  Shout out to everybody over at seedsherenow.
[01:07.880 --> 01:09.280]  They take really good care of me.
[01:09.280 --> 01:11.400]  They treat me like a family member.
[01:11.400 --> 01:12.400]  Lots of love for those guys.
[01:12.400 --> 01:13.640]  I'm not just kissing their ass.
[01:13.640 --> 01:15.320]  It's like, we check on each other and shit.
[01:15.320 --> 01:18.340]  During the COVID times, they were messaging me every three or four days.
[01:18.340 --> 01:19.600]  One of them would say, what's up, bro?
[01:19.600 --> 01:20.600]  How you doing?
[01:20.600 --> 01:21.600]  You healthy?
[01:21.600 --> 01:22.600]  You safe?
[01:22.600 --> 01:23.600]  That kind of stuff goes a long way.
[01:23.600 --> 01:24.600]  It means a lot to me.
[01:24.600 --> 01:25.600]  Yeah, it does.
[01:25.600 --> 01:26.600]  This is the part of the show where we talk about what we're smoking.
[01:26.600 --> 01:28.600]  Jesse, I'll let you go first.
[01:29.320 --> 01:30.320]  You rolled up a big fat joint over there.
[01:30.320 --> 01:31.320]  It smelled delicious.
[01:31.320 --> 01:32.320]  What are you puffing on?
[01:32.320 --> 01:35.560]  It is some outdoor from last year that my dad grew.
[01:35.560 --> 01:40.240]  It is Yeti OG times bubble gum.
[01:40.240 --> 01:41.240]  That sounds great.
[01:41.240 --> 01:42.240]  I know both of those strains.
[01:42.240 --> 01:45.240]  I remember the Yeti being gassy, kind of fuely and funky.
[01:45.240 --> 01:49.280]  And bubble gum, of course, has got that sweet bubble gum flavor.
[01:49.280 --> 01:50.840]  Big shout out to old man Jesse.
[01:50.840 --> 01:53.840]  I don't even know if we should say his name on here, but big shout out to that guy.
[01:53.840 --> 01:56.920]  Big shout out to Jay, the old pirate.
[01:56.920 --> 01:57.920]  You guys, you should see this guy.
[01:58.240 --> 02:01.240]  He's been growing longer than you've been alive, and he's still a bad motherfucker.
[02:01.240 --> 02:03.080]  Yeah, he grows pretty decent.
[02:03.080 --> 02:04.760]  I think he does a damn good job.
[02:04.760 --> 02:06.080]  You said that was outdoor, and I was surprised.
[02:06.080 --> 02:07.520]  I was like, oh man, I just said outdoor.
[02:07.520 --> 02:10.320]  It smelled really good.
[02:10.320 --> 02:11.320]  Good job, Jay.
[02:11.320 --> 02:12.320]  Good job, brother.
[02:12.320 --> 02:13.320]  I do approve.
[02:13.320 --> 02:14.880]  This is the point of the show where we do shout outs to our friends.
[02:14.880 --> 02:16.440]  Oh, I didn't tell you what I'm smoking.
[02:16.440 --> 02:18.080]  I wanted to get moving too quickly.
[02:18.080 --> 02:22.440]  I am dabbing Tropicana Cookies Live Batter from Apothecary Farms.
[02:22.440 --> 02:23.880]  Tropicana Cookies.
[02:23.880 --> 02:25.040]  Tropicana and cookies.
[02:25.040 --> 02:26.040]  It's orange.
[02:26.040 --> 02:27.040]  It's delicious.
[02:27.160 --> 02:31.240]  It's citrusy, funky, and then a little bit of spicy from the cookies.
[02:31.240 --> 02:32.720]  I'm going to crack it open.
[02:32.720 --> 02:33.720]  It rips.
[02:33.720 --> 02:34.720]  It rips.
[02:34.720 --> 02:38.080]  It's got a lot of limonene and citrusy turps.
[02:38.080 --> 02:40.560]  I don't know what that citrus turp is called off the top of my head.
[02:40.560 --> 02:43.320]  It's funky and almost gross, and I really enjoy it.
[02:43.320 --> 02:45.320]  I like gross aromas.
[02:45.320 --> 02:46.800]  That's the Tropicana Cookies.
[02:46.800 --> 02:49.840]  That's what's got me out of control and rambly today.
[02:49.840 --> 02:50.920]  Jesse took a smaller dab of that.
[02:50.920 --> 02:52.560]  I took a large dab.
[02:52.560 --> 02:54.960]  Jesse put the joint out after the dab.
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.120]  Tells you how that Tropicana Cookies punched us in the face.
[02:59.120 --> 03:03.000]  Now this is officially the point in the show where we do shout outs to the folks who support
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.480]  us on Patreon.
[03:04.480 --> 03:06.560]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:06.560 --> 03:07.640]  Shout out to Meredith.
[03:07.640 --> 03:09.800]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Rick Roller.
[03:09.800 --> 03:13.320]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to HD Chop.
[03:13.320 --> 03:17.120]  I want to send a giant thank you shout out to my friend Nomi by my guacamole.
[03:17.120 --> 03:19.560]  How about a big shout out to Jose P. I know.
[03:19.560 --> 03:20.560]  That's what he said.
[03:20.560 --> 03:21.560]  No, that's what he said to Colin, bro.
[03:21.560 --> 03:22.560]  Rad name, dude.
[03:22.560 --> 03:23.560]  That is a rad name.
[03:23.560 --> 03:25.000]  That's some really cool names.
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.100]  Since we're on it, how about a shout out to Popper Roni.
[03:27.100 --> 03:28.720]  That's another really cool name.
[03:28.720 --> 03:31.840]  Big shout out to Keith R. A big thank you shout out to Kelly Canopy.
[03:31.840 --> 03:33.680]  A big giant fist bump to Paul.
[03:33.680 --> 03:38.400]  And certainly last but not least, let's give a thank you shout out to our friend Maroni.
[03:38.400 --> 03:41.960]  Big thanks and big shout out to all of the folks who continue to support the show on
[03:41.960 --> 03:42.960]  Patreon.
[03:42.960 --> 03:46.040]  If you're not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[03:46.040 --> 03:47.040]  it is really easy.
[03:47.040 --> 03:53.080]  All you have to do is go to www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:53.080 --> 03:55.680]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[03:55.680 --> 04:00.360]  I did put a link in the show notes and there is a link in the video description on YouTube.
[04:00.360 --> 04:01.360]  So just click on the link.
[04:01.360 --> 04:02.640]  It will take you right there.
[04:02.640 --> 04:06.560]  If you go to Patreon, you cannot search for the grow from your heart podcast.
[04:06.560 --> 04:09.800]  I guess we're shadow banned because we are cannabis adult content.
[04:09.800 --> 04:15.320]  You have to type in the full URL, uh, patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[04:15.320 --> 04:16.400]  Type that one in, in the browser.
[04:16.400 --> 04:17.440]  You'll find it that way.
[04:17.440 --> 04:20.720]  Or like I said before, follow the link in the show notes.
[04:20.720 --> 04:21.720]  All right.
[04:21.720 --> 04:23.280]  I think that is all of the business stuff.
[04:23.280 --> 04:24.560]  Oh, I got to give an update.
[04:24.560 --> 04:26.560]  The led plants look amazing.
[04:26.560 --> 04:28.280]  Jesse saw the plants that are under the LEDs.
[04:28.280 --> 04:29.280]  What do you think, bro?
[04:29.280 --> 04:30.280]  They look great.
[04:30.280 --> 04:31.280]  Yeah.
[04:31.280 --> 04:32.280]  I'm yeah.
[04:32.280 --> 04:33.520]  I'm pretty impressed actually.
[04:33.520 --> 04:34.520]  There we go.
[04:34.520 --> 04:37.400]  You heard it from Jesse and Jesse is hard to impress.
[04:37.400 --> 04:40.840]  Those little lights, uh, rock.
[04:40.840 --> 04:44.400]  That's a new millennium nutrients and Canon, uh, LEDs in there.
[04:44.400 --> 04:45.680]  So that's what's doing that.
[04:45.680 --> 04:46.680]  Yeah.
[04:46.680 --> 04:47.680]  When he saw him, he went, Oh shit.
[04:47.680 --> 04:49.360]  Like he was pretty excited about that.
[04:49.360 --> 04:51.440]  So that is all of the business we're going to cover for today.
[04:51.440 --> 04:52.440]  Uh, Jesse is back.
[04:52.440 --> 04:55.880]  And if you guys listen to this podcast, you know that Jesse is my outdoor guru.
[04:55.880 --> 05:00.080]  When it comes to asking questions, Jesse is the guy I turn to it is outdoor season.
[05:00.080 --> 05:04.240]  By the time this episode comes out, we are a little bit late for outdoor season, but
[05:04.240 --> 05:05.240]  we're busy people.
[05:05.240 --> 05:08.560]  Jesse's been in Mexico and Oklahoma and all over the damn place.
[05:08.560 --> 05:09.560]  Tell them where else you've been.
[05:09.560 --> 05:13.200]  If you want to share any of your adventures, uh, Vegas.
[05:13.200 --> 05:14.200]  I wasn't going to say Vegas.
[05:14.200 --> 05:15.360]  That's the place that I left out.
[05:15.360 --> 05:16.760]  I was like, do I say Vegas?
[05:16.760 --> 05:19.640]  I got to a shout out to Chris Medzen.
[05:19.640 --> 05:21.160]  His, his IgE name.
[05:21.160 --> 05:27.000]  I doubt he's listening, but, um, he, uh, got to show us the grow that is associated to,
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.280]  um, uh, planet 13 dispensary.
[05:29.280 --> 05:30.280]  Oh, cool.
[05:30.280 --> 05:32.040]  Uh, it, it was impressive.
[05:32.040 --> 05:34.120]  It's the biggest dispensary in Vegas, right?
[05:34.120 --> 05:35.360]  I probably do.
[05:35.360 --> 05:36.360]  That place is huge.
[05:36.360 --> 05:37.360]  It's cool.
[05:37.360 --> 05:38.360]  It's got a fucking bar in it.
[05:38.360 --> 05:41.080]  Like a bar where you can get a drink and just chill while you're waiting.
[05:41.080 --> 05:42.080]  Yeah.
[05:42.080 --> 05:43.080]  And a brewery.
[05:43.080 --> 05:44.200]  Like it's insane, dude.
[05:44.200 --> 05:45.560]  That's it's awesome.
[05:45.560 --> 05:46.560]  And it's a bit much.
[05:46.560 --> 05:47.560]  Yeah.
[05:47.560 --> 05:48.560]  It's distracting.
[05:48.560 --> 05:49.560]  It is.
[05:49.560 --> 05:52.480]  You want to buy some weed and have a beer and meet some people and mingle.
[05:52.480 --> 05:53.480]  Yes.
[05:53.480 --> 05:54.480]  That sounds awesome.
[05:54.480 --> 05:55.480]  Yeah.
[05:55.480 --> 05:56.480]  Yeah.
[05:56.480 --> 05:57.480]  Um, so shout out to that guy.
[05:57.480 --> 05:58.480]  Somebody tagged that guy that you just shouted out.
[05:58.480 --> 05:59.480]  Somebody tag him.
[05:59.480 --> 06:01.200]  So he hears this episode and knows he just got a really cool shout out.
[06:01.200 --> 06:02.200]  Nice.
[06:02.200 --> 06:03.200]  Nice.
[06:03.200 --> 06:04.200]  Yeah.
[06:04.200 --> 06:07.800]  It's a, um, uh, considering how much cannabis, you know, they're not the only grow that supplies
[06:07.800 --> 06:11.000]  to planet 13, but they do supply a lot of it.
[06:11.000 --> 06:14.560]  Um, and it's a pretty small group, you know, relatively speaking.
[06:14.560 --> 06:17.120]  So it was impressive to see its efficiency.
[06:17.120 --> 06:18.120]  Cool.
[06:18.120 --> 06:21.800]  So when you got a small place, I have known a lot of small places that I've had to really
[06:21.800 --> 06:23.160]  bang it out and keep it going.
[06:23.160 --> 06:26.120]  And so it's, it's almost harder in a small place because if you miss a couple of days
[06:26.120 --> 06:28.000]  on the rhythm, Oh dude, you're fucked.
[06:28.000 --> 06:29.000]  Oh yeah.
[06:29.000 --> 06:33.280]  If you don't cut clones on this day and pop those this day and then move this room, everything
[06:33.280 --> 06:34.320]  falls out of place.
[06:34.320 --> 06:35.320]  You never get it back.
[06:35.320 --> 06:36.320]  Never, never.
[06:36.320 --> 06:39.800]  And then you're one full week behind and then we expect a, what is it?
[06:39.800 --> 06:41.200]  5.7 crops per year.
[06:41.200 --> 06:44.720]  If you do nine weeks divided or however many 72 weeks, right?
[06:44.720 --> 06:48.960]  52, 52 weeks a year divided by nine, I think you get 5.7 crops or something like that.
[06:48.960 --> 06:49.960]  Yeah.
[06:49.960 --> 06:50.960]  So we expect that many crops.
[06:50.960 --> 06:51.960]  We need them.
[06:51.960 --> 06:56.360]  I've worked at a place that I expected 52 crops and I gave it to them.
[06:56.360 --> 07:00.240]  Some places, uh, some owners you say, uh, they say, Hey, how long does this crop take
[07:00.240 --> 07:01.240]  to finish?
[07:01.240 --> 07:03.480]  And you go nine weeks and they go, we'll be back in eight weeks to collect our money.
[07:03.480 --> 07:04.840]  And you go, wait, wait a minute.
[07:04.840 --> 07:05.840]  How does this?
[07:05.840 --> 07:08.840]  And then every time you see them, like, so seven weeks sounds beautiful, right?
[07:08.840 --> 07:09.840]  How much are you going to pull?
[07:09.840 --> 07:12.320]  And you say maybe a pound of light and they go two pounds of light.
[07:12.320 --> 07:13.320]  That sounds awesome.
[07:13.320 --> 07:14.320]  We'll be back in six weeks.
[07:14.320 --> 07:17.040]  It just gets tighter and tighter every time you go on.
[07:17.040 --> 07:18.040]  That's the wrong way.
[07:18.040 --> 07:19.440]  All right, we should focus down.
[07:19.440 --> 07:21.120]  We're doing a podcast about outdoor growing.
[07:21.120 --> 07:24.360]  Suddenly we're talking about commercial cultivation.
[07:24.360 --> 07:26.760]  Like I said, Jesse is my outdoor cultivation guru.
[07:26.760 --> 07:28.120]  How does that make you feel, bro?
[07:28.120 --> 07:32.160]  You're my guru for outdoor growing, which means now you've become a large audience's
[07:32.160 --> 07:33.160]  outdoor guru.
[07:33.160 --> 07:34.760]  You're the outdoor Yoda today.
[07:34.760 --> 07:37.360]  I'm just a guy that's a fucked up a lot, dude.
[07:37.360 --> 07:38.360]  That's what I say.
[07:38.360 --> 07:39.360]  I'm no expert.
[07:39.880 --> 07:40.880]  I've been there with a whole bunch of experience.
[07:40.880 --> 07:44.280]  Yeah, I've just done it a lot of times.
[07:44.280 --> 07:48.440]  So I think the number one question right now, today we are recording and I know this episode
[07:48.440 --> 07:50.760]  is going to be delayed because we're recording.
[07:50.760 --> 07:52.680]  They're going to be, yeah, I'm ahead of myself.
[07:52.680 --> 07:55.400]  Today is the 16th of May.
[07:55.400 --> 07:57.400]  It's starting to get really nice outside.
[07:57.400 --> 07:59.040]  We've had some consistently warm days.
[07:59.040 --> 08:00.600]  We've also had some hailstorms.
[08:00.600 --> 08:02.200]  That'll be some stuff to address.
[08:02.200 --> 08:06.920]  I think the golden question right now is when do we put in, keep in mind you guys, we're
[08:06.920 --> 08:07.920]  in Colorado.
[08:07.920 --> 08:09.040]  We are on mountain time.
[08:09.720 --> 08:11.280]  We're here in Southern Colorado.
[08:11.280 --> 08:14.720]  Maybe some of Jesse's guidance will also relate to Oklahoma because he works down there quite
[08:14.720 --> 08:15.720]  a bit.
[08:15.720 --> 08:19.600]  But right now, most of what we talk about will probably be based on Colorado and the
[08:19.600 --> 08:22.400]  mountain time zone on the mountain area.
[08:22.400 --> 08:25.160]  So the golden question is when do we put our plants outside, dude?
[08:25.160 --> 08:29.800]  When would be safe to start putting our cannabis plants outside for the season?
[08:29.800 --> 08:36.000]  In most of Colorado and most of the country, you're totally safe to be outdoors right now.
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.360]  Kind of Mother's Day is what you shoot for.
[08:39.360 --> 08:44.200]  In Colorado, it's not unusual to get a cold snap.
[08:44.200 --> 08:45.960]  I think we've passed that part though.
[08:45.960 --> 08:49.360]  I think it's at least here in Southern Colorado.
[08:49.360 --> 08:53.040]  And you say Mother's Day and that's ironic because we got a serious fucking thunderstorm
[08:53.040 --> 08:56.640]  on Mother's Day with some hail and some shit this year on Mother's Day.
[08:56.640 --> 09:01.040]  We had hell over on the east side on Thursday.
[09:01.040 --> 09:02.040]  Yeah.
[09:02.040 --> 09:03.680]  I wanted to pull my car in the garage a couple of nights ago.
[09:03.680 --> 09:04.680]  I got, almost did it.
[09:05.360 --> 09:06.200]  I was like, it's close.
[09:06.200 --> 09:07.200]  It's almost that hard.
[09:07.200 --> 09:08.200]  Yeah.
[09:08.200 --> 09:09.200]  Right.
[09:09.200 --> 09:10.200]  Yeah.
[09:10.200 --> 09:14.160]  You know, that's, if you're brave, you can definitely have your plants out right now.
[09:14.160 --> 09:16.240]  I planted some today.
[09:16.240 --> 09:17.240]  So.
[09:17.240 --> 09:18.240]  All right.
[09:18.240 --> 09:19.240]  So you guys, I apologize.
[09:19.240 --> 09:20.240]  We're behind schedule.
[09:20.240 --> 09:23.920]  Like I said, we're both busy guys, but put them outside, get them outside because we
[09:23.920 --> 09:25.360]  should have had them out there already.
[09:25.360 --> 09:28.840]  It sounds like, you know, I think the next question people are going to ask is when should
[09:28.840 --> 09:31.040]  we expect, and this will be strain dependent.
[09:31.040 --> 09:32.040]  I understand that.
[09:32.040 --> 09:34.240]  When should we expect things to start flowering?
[09:34.800 --> 09:37.680]  Back to the last question real quick.
[09:37.680 --> 09:42.000]  If you don't have your plants out, don't feel that you're late or behind the curve or anything.
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.760]  So you haven't missed anything.
[09:44.760 --> 09:46.920]  You got plenty of time to still get your plants out.
[09:46.920 --> 09:47.920]  Excellent.
[09:47.920 --> 09:48.920]  Yeah.
[09:48.920 --> 09:49.920]  Excellent.
[09:49.920 --> 09:50.920]  Yeah.
[09:50.920 --> 09:51.920]  So when to expect stuff to start flowering.
[09:51.920 --> 09:57.040]  Typically here in Colorado, it's going to be towards the end of July or early August.
[09:57.040 --> 09:59.840]  I'm going to make a note of that because I ask you this question every year, Mother's
[09:59.840 --> 10:01.640]  Day and then end of July.
[10:01.640 --> 10:02.640]  Yeah.
[10:02.640 --> 10:03.640]  Yeah.
[10:04.040 --> 10:09.120]  So I would say the early strains, especially like the ones that are easier to trigger like
[10:09.120 --> 10:10.120]  Indica's kind of.
[10:10.120 --> 10:11.680]  The ones you should have selected.
[10:11.680 --> 10:12.680]  Yeah.
[10:12.680 --> 10:13.680]  Yeah.
[10:13.680 --> 10:14.680]  Yeah.
[10:14.680 --> 10:15.680]  Yeah.
[10:15.680 --> 10:16.680]  Yeah.
[10:16.680 --> 10:22.040]  I've even seen them start packing pistols and making bud growth in late July.
[10:22.040 --> 10:23.040]  So.
[10:23.040 --> 10:24.040]  Okay.
[10:24.040 --> 10:25.400]  So we've still got a good 45 days at this time.
[10:25.400 --> 10:28.360]  By the time this comes out, we'll still have a good month of edge.
[10:28.360 --> 10:31.840]  And if you're growing outdoors in your neighborhood or something, you don't need giant, massive
[10:31.840 --> 10:33.600]  plants and they're going to get big outside.
[10:33.600 --> 10:37.500]  You guys be prepared if you're going indoors and you're used to the way they grow indoors.
[10:37.500 --> 10:41.480]  When you go outdoors, you're going to say, holy shit, every day.
[10:41.480 --> 10:45.440]  And it outdoors, there's kind of, you know, there's a indoors.
[10:45.440 --> 10:51.840]  Everyone looks at it as a badge and a bloom in outdoor growing that transition period
[10:51.840 --> 10:54.540]  kind of counts as a growth phase, in my opinion.
[10:54.540 --> 10:59.040]  So even once they start flowering, they're still going to stretch more than what you
[10:59.040 --> 11:02.200]  would see, you know, even see in an indoor setting.
[11:02.200 --> 11:05.080]  So the sun is amazing.
[11:05.080 --> 11:07.840]  That's like the most powerful light that you could ever imagine.
[11:07.840 --> 11:08.840]  Yeah.
[11:08.840 --> 11:16.720]  If you got good sun consistent and good watering and healthy soil, yeah, it'll be great.
[11:16.720 --> 11:19.740]  Now you've given me a couple of options in which way to segue.
[11:19.740 --> 11:21.840]  You said strain selection a moment ago.
[11:21.840 --> 11:26.580]  What are some things we should think about for selecting strains to put outdoors?
[11:26.580 --> 11:32.900]  In most parts of the country, you can run pretty much anything you want.
[11:32.900 --> 11:40.020]  Just stay away from like hazes, no Wilhawkins, no ties, you know, that stuff's never going
[11:40.020 --> 11:42.140]  to finish up unless you got a greenhouse.
[11:42.140 --> 11:51.780]  But you know, that's, let's say in Oklahoma, they've got a lot of humidity, especially
[11:51.780 --> 11:53.020]  late in the season.
[11:53.020 --> 11:57.940]  So you want to go for a bud that's kind of airy, not super compact.
[11:57.940 --> 12:02.060]  In Colorado, it gets cold here early.
[12:02.060 --> 12:06.340]  So the buds that are really compact and have really dense, or the plants that are really
[12:06.340 --> 12:10.780]  compact and have really dense buds tend to finish earlier.
[12:10.780 --> 12:14.140]  You need to think about like regional differences.
[12:14.140 --> 12:17.020]  What does your region require?
[12:17.020 --> 12:21.060]  Right now, one of the most common questions I get for seed requests are what are things
[12:21.060 --> 12:22.860]  that are really mildew resistant?
[12:23.700 --> 12:25.940]  They want things that are powdery mildew and boitritis resistant.
[12:25.940 --> 12:30.780]  And a lot of these questions are coming from people on Maine or from Maine and on the coast
[12:30.780 --> 12:35.180]  up there in the Northeast because they get a shorter season, it gets colder, it gets
[12:35.180 --> 12:37.900]  mildewy and they need stuff that finishes early.
[12:37.900 --> 12:42.380]  Not to plug my own brand for something that is, from my line, shameless plug, something
[12:42.380 --> 12:47.460]  that is known to be powdery mildew resistant, boitritis resistant, and also the aroma keeps
[12:47.460 --> 12:49.140]  the pests away.
[12:49.140 --> 12:54.220]  Morning dew and prana are great crosses for outdoor all across the country.
[12:54.220 --> 12:56.740]  And sun kiss is also really great.
[12:56.740 --> 12:59.500]  And the orange chasm works great outdoors.
[12:59.500 --> 13:03.900]  But I've noticed that that morning dew, anything that came from the grateful dog has been known
[13:03.900 --> 13:08.980]  to be, yeah, that grateful dog plant, it's powdery mildew resistant, it's boitritis resistant.
[13:08.980 --> 13:13.700]  I've had PM in grow rooms before where every plant except the grateful dog has been hit
[13:13.700 --> 13:14.700]  with PM.
[13:14.700 --> 13:17.500]  So that's one that I can say, put that outdoors.
[13:17.500 --> 13:20.060]  Anything crossed with flow or a grateful dog will do.
[13:20.060 --> 13:21.060]  Yeah.
[13:21.060 --> 13:23.060]  DJ short stuff does really good outdoors.
[13:23.060 --> 13:26.940]  Flow has always been a favorite of mine for outdoor in Colorado.
[13:26.940 --> 13:31.620]  I've grown it at pretty high elevation and I've grown it in the dry hot parts too.
[13:31.620 --> 13:36.900]  So it's the cut that goes around here in Colorado.
[13:36.900 --> 13:42.060]  And the one I believe Jeff worked with is a very resilient plant.
[13:42.060 --> 13:43.060]  That's why I worked with it.
[13:43.060 --> 13:45.260]  And that's why I recommend that one to my beginner growers.
[13:45.260 --> 13:48.540]  When people are brand new, I'm like, get this one because flow gross, you can, you
[13:48.540 --> 13:49.860]  can pee on it and kick it over.
[13:49.860 --> 13:53.260]  And when you go over tomorrow, it will have picked itself up and uprighted the pot and
[13:53.260 --> 13:55.780]  trimmed itself and it'll be ready to go for you again.
[13:55.780 --> 13:58.220]  And it'll make you feel like you're the best grower in the world.
[13:58.220 --> 13:59.220]  It does.
[13:59.220 --> 14:00.220]  I am.
[14:00.220 --> 14:03.860]  When you said it was the cut that I had, part of me felt weird inside because I almost wish
[14:03.860 --> 14:05.540]  I hadn't gotten rid of it.
[14:05.540 --> 14:10.020]  But there was a point in my life where at home I was growing flow at work.
[14:10.020 --> 14:11.380]  I was growing flow.
[14:11.380 --> 14:14.940]  I ran a dispensary where I did the growing before and after work.
[14:14.940 --> 14:18.060]  And then during the day I did the bud tending, I would sell the herb.
[14:18.060 --> 14:23.540]  So my house, my bedroom, my workspace, my hair, my car, my life, my dog, everything
[14:23.540 --> 14:25.060]  smelled like flow.
[14:25.060 --> 14:26.060]  I loved it.
[14:26.060 --> 14:29.300]  But also sometimes I was like, can I smell something different?
[14:29.300 --> 14:31.420]  Like I just want to not smell flow.
[14:31.420 --> 14:33.660]  So I grew tired of it and I let it go.
[14:33.660 --> 14:35.380]  I bred, I made a bunch of crosses to it.
[14:35.380 --> 14:39.000]  I made a bunch of seeds of Prana is the cross that came from there.
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.180]  And then one day I retired her, bro.
[14:41.980 --> 14:42.980]  She got the choppity chop chop.
[14:42.980 --> 14:47.420]  I gave out a bunch of cuts of her first because that's what you do, but she got the chop.
[14:47.420 --> 14:51.820]  I have a strain that is very similar to that story that you work with that I'm not going
[14:51.820 --> 14:54.660]  to name the strain, but I can relate.
[14:54.660 --> 14:58.180]  Oh, I know which one by the look on your face.
[14:58.180 --> 15:01.020]  I could tell that's a, that's a really popular strain.
[15:01.020 --> 15:06.580]  And I think the run of it I've got going now will probably be it's a, it's final destination.
[15:06.580 --> 15:07.580]  I'm tired of that.
[15:07.580 --> 15:11.140]  Yeah, it was, if we're talking about the same one, it's a pain in the ass to grow.
[15:12.100 --> 15:13.700]  And it's not fruitful.
[15:13.700 --> 15:15.620]  I'm a breeder and it doesn't make seeds, bro.
[15:15.620 --> 15:19.700]  You can pollinate that thing at just the right time or just the wrong time or both of them.
[15:19.700 --> 15:23.140]  And the plant next to it will get 300 to 500 seeds.
[15:23.140 --> 15:28.260]  And that one gave me six, not 600, six seeds, dude.
[15:28.260 --> 15:29.380]  And five of them looked good.
[15:29.380 --> 15:30.940]  One of them was kind of iffy.
[15:30.940 --> 15:33.700]  So yeah, you guys, I'm talking about the Mac.
[15:33.700 --> 15:35.220]  I don't know what plant Jesse is talking about.
[15:35.220 --> 15:36.940]  I'm going to divulge secrets here.
[15:36.940 --> 15:38.700]  I don't like to leave my listeners in the dark.
[15:38.700 --> 15:40.420]  They're all going, what fucking strain was that?
[15:40.740 --> 15:41.820]  Yelling into their phones.
[15:41.820 --> 15:44.060]  So strain selection is really important.
[15:44.060 --> 15:45.380]  Like Jesse said, don't pick a haze.
[15:45.380 --> 15:48.380]  You don't want something, unless you've got a greenhouse and you plan on keeping it warm.
[15:48.380 --> 15:49.900]  You want to put a heater out there or something.
[15:49.900 --> 15:55.340]  Something that is going to go 70-ish days is probably the max you want to put outside.
[15:55.340 --> 15:58.700]  In Colorado, the golden goat will finish on time for you out there.
[15:58.700 --> 16:00.740]  I hear people stressing over the golden goat.
[16:00.740 --> 16:01.540]  They're like, it's Halloween.
[16:01.540 --> 16:03.180]  I need to cut down this fucking golden goat.
[16:03.180 --> 16:06.580]  You can make golden goat turn purple outside.
[16:06.580 --> 16:07.420]  Oh yeah, you can.
[16:07.420 --> 16:09.500]  Not the, not the bud so much.
[16:09.540 --> 16:13.740]  Maybe like the outside hair, but the leaves turn like this crazy purple color.
[16:13.740 --> 16:14.300]  It's really cool.
[16:14.300 --> 16:16.780]  They do this weird crinkle sometimes towards the end.
[16:16.780 --> 16:17.540]  So be prepared.
[16:17.540 --> 16:21.300]  Have a plant that can handle mildew, powdery mildew, boetritis.
[16:21.300 --> 16:22.700]  Something that is bug resistant.
[16:22.700 --> 16:26.140]  Something with a good finish time and something that can handle temperature swings.
[16:26.140 --> 16:29.260]  We're going to see a lot of crazy temperature swings all across the country.
[16:29.260 --> 16:30.780]  The planet is all weird.
[16:30.780 --> 16:36.060]  We got a hailstorm and a super hot day and a cold night all within one sandwich time period here.
[16:36.060 --> 16:40.020]  So I wore shorts, long sleeves, a t-shirt and no shoes all on the same day.
[16:40.340 --> 16:41.860]  Let's add in structure too.
[16:41.860 --> 16:42.780]  That's really important.
[16:43.140 --> 16:49.260]  Um, a lot of the really crazy, uh, like Cali poly hybrids that are really popular
[16:49.260 --> 16:50.900]  right now don't have the best structure.
[16:51.380 --> 16:56.500]  Um, and I, I, I've seen plants like that just completely get torn apart
[16:56.500 --> 16:57.780]  outside cause they can't take it.
[16:58.540 --> 16:58.660]  Yeah.
[16:58.660 --> 17:01.860]  Those were bred for, uh, Instagram instead of for growing.
[17:02.060 --> 17:02.420]  Yeah.
[17:02.940 --> 17:05.740]  Um, uh, shit.
[17:05.740 --> 17:06.540]  What was I going to say?
[17:07.020 --> 17:07.420]  Nevermind.
[17:08.220 --> 17:08.900]  It'll come back to you.
[17:08.900 --> 17:09.980]  Just yell it out when it does.
[17:10.580 --> 17:14.140]  So, um, what issues do you think people should be prepared for?
[17:14.140 --> 17:15.340]  I know we're going to get crazy weather.
[17:15.340 --> 17:16.300]  I keep talking about that.
[17:16.300 --> 17:19.300]  What are other things that you think people should be prepared for outside?
[17:19.300 --> 17:20.380]  What do you run into?
[17:21.260 --> 17:26.140]  Um, watering can be an issue, especially if you're growing in pots.
[17:26.220 --> 17:29.580]  If you can grow in the, in the ground, I highly recommend it.
[17:29.580 --> 17:35.980]  Especially if, um, if, if you're newer to this, um, the, the,
[17:36.060 --> 17:38.100]  the earth is really forgiving.
[17:38.220 --> 17:42.500]  So, um, make, make sure you got some nice mulch around the plant.
[17:43.060 --> 17:49.300]  Um, and a steady, consistent watering, you know, you don't have to overwater
[17:49.300 --> 17:53.700]  it, if anything, maybe a little underwater it, um, to help make the
[17:53.740 --> 17:55.420]  plant tougher, uh, and veg.
[17:55.860 --> 18:01.740]  Um, but if you have a good mulched ground, um, that really does you, uh,
[18:01.780 --> 18:05.460]  you're doing yourself a really big favor by doing that and it just
[18:05.460 --> 18:06.660]  makes it so much easier.
[18:06.940 --> 18:07.220]  Cool.
[18:07.260 --> 18:09.020]  So I was going to ask you, pots are in the ground and you
[18:09.020 --> 18:10.060]  say, go right in the ground.
[18:10.300 --> 18:12.140]  I mean, do it however you have to.
[18:12.380 --> 18:15.100]  But, uh, if you can go on the ground, go in the ground.
[18:15.220 --> 18:21.500]  Um, if you have to do pots, uh, I'd recommend like a fabric pot, um, or
[18:21.500 --> 18:28.180]  maybe some of those fabric beds, um, cover it in a, in a white plastic
[18:28.180 --> 18:31.100]  is a trick I've used to keep the pot from heating up so much.
[18:31.500 --> 18:34.180]  So in the middle of the summer, most pots are black.
[18:34.500 --> 18:38.820]  Um, that, that shit gets like scorching hot, like 140 degrees.
[18:38.820 --> 18:45.020]  It just roasts the roots and just sucks the water out of the soil so fast.
[18:45.460 --> 18:49.540]  Um, so some of the tricks I've used is covering it in panda
[18:49.540 --> 18:50.980]  plastic with the white side out.
[18:51.540 --> 18:58.380]  Um, or cover building up a mound of mulch, um, around the pot itself.
[18:58.620 --> 19:00.660]  But you could use straw, you could use.
[19:01.460 --> 19:05.300]  Uh, wood chips, you know, anything you need to get it done.
[19:05.300 --> 19:08.740]  Just something that's organic and it's going to hold some water
[19:08.820 --> 19:11.780]  and has air pockets, a little insulation, sort of perfect.
[19:11.820 --> 19:12.940]  It's kind of like a swamp cooler.
[19:13.180 --> 19:14.460]  So you guys got to think about water.
[19:14.500 --> 19:16.060]  That's something I didn't write down on my notes.
[19:16.060 --> 19:17.060]  We're going to have big plants.
[19:17.300 --> 19:18.580]  Do you have access to water?
[19:18.580 --> 19:21.300]  If you're growing out on the farm somewhere, can you get water there?
[19:21.300 --> 19:21.940]  Do you have a truck?
[19:21.980 --> 19:23.060]  You may need to haul water in.
[19:23.060 --> 19:26.220]  If you don't have a major long hose or some irrigation, some of you
[19:26.220 --> 19:27.420]  may be just growing in the backyard.
[19:27.420 --> 19:29.260]  Some of you may be doing some struggle grow this year.
[19:29.420 --> 19:31.060]  Think about how you're going to get the water out there.
[19:31.220 --> 19:33.460]  Plan ahead, set yourself up for success.
[19:33.940 --> 19:37.420]  Um, I wrote down whether it's going to get hot, it's going to get cold.
[19:37.660 --> 19:39.300]  It's going to rain and it's going to hail.
[19:39.700 --> 19:43.100]  Uh, do you have an affordable idea of how to protect these plants from hail?
[19:43.100 --> 19:45.380]  Or do we just leave them out there and hope for the best?
[19:45.860 --> 19:47.820]  Uh, it kind of depends on the size of the plant.
[19:47.900 --> 19:51.740]  You know, if there, if you know you got a hell storm coming and, and you're, it's
[19:51.740 --> 19:56.100]  kind of early in the season still, um, go, go throw a barrel or a bucket over
[19:56.100 --> 19:57.780]  that, that bitch, even a box.
[19:57.940 --> 20:04.020]  Like, um, last year I had, um, on the day that I'd planted something like a hundred
[20:04.020 --> 20:09.140]  tomatoes, like literally as we'd finished planning the last one, here comes the hell.
[20:10.620 --> 20:12.300]  And so we're running around out there.
[20:12.740 --> 20:18.660]  Um, luckily there was a hundred empty five gallon pots at this farm and, uh, we
[20:18.660 --> 20:22.900]  covered each, every single one of the tomato plants as soon as we got it done.
[20:23.180 --> 20:23.860]  The hell was gone.
[20:23.860 --> 20:24.300]  Of course.
[20:24.340 --> 20:24.580]  Yeah.
[20:25.660 --> 20:26.500]  It's just testing you.
[20:26.700 --> 20:29.020]  You thought you got done early that day and you were going to go smoke.
[20:29.020 --> 20:31.620]  And it was like, no, you did that sound really cool.
[20:31.620 --> 20:33.820]  And all the hail was hitting those five gallon pots on the bottom.
[20:33.820 --> 20:35.620]  It's not like a really bad drum circle.
[20:36.020 --> 20:37.740]  Um, probably at first it did.
[20:37.820 --> 20:40.140]  I, I, that was definitely a panic thing.
[20:40.140 --> 20:41.420]  So, yeah.
[20:41.460 --> 20:41.740]  Right.
[20:42.020 --> 20:45.060]  So if you've got a big trash can or something, anything you can just flip
[20:45.060 --> 20:48.340]  upside down and create a little shelter for these plants, you guys be prepared.
[20:48.740 --> 20:50.860]  Um, what else do you got for us, bro?
[20:50.900 --> 20:54.740]  Um, I mean, I've seen just a single layer of plastic stop some hell.
[20:54.860 --> 21:02.460]  Um, so maybe like a PVC hoop over your plants, um, you know, whatever you got
[21:02.460 --> 21:07.380]  to do to like hanging plastic or tarp over it, um, you know, that, that can
[21:07.380 --> 21:13.140]  totally protect it, uh, even chicken wire, um, to a certain degree can, can,
[21:13.140 --> 21:15.340]  uh, break up hell and protect your plants.
[21:15.380 --> 21:15.660]  Oh yeah.
[21:15.700 --> 21:17.940]  Make it smaller instead of big asteroids coming in.
[21:17.940 --> 21:18.180]  Yeah.
[21:18.180 --> 21:18.420]  Yeah.
[21:18.420 --> 21:18.820]  That's cool.
[21:18.860 --> 21:19.580]  That really helps.
[21:19.980 --> 21:21.740]  So there's some good ideas on how to protect it.
[21:22.220 --> 21:24.900]  Um, what are some of the pests that we're going to be facing?
[21:25.500 --> 21:30.460]  Um, a aphids, uh, uh, probably, uh, the Miller moths.
[21:30.660 --> 21:31.820]  Oh God, I hate those things.
[21:31.860 --> 21:32.620]  Don't talk about them.
[21:32.740 --> 21:32.940]  Yeah.
[21:34.260 --> 21:34.940]  Aphids.
[21:34.980 --> 21:38.620]  Uh, you generally don't see spider mites outside unless
[21:38.660 --> 21:39.940]  your plants already had them.
[21:40.380 --> 21:41.460]  Um, okay.
[21:41.460 --> 21:46.140]  Unless you took them out there and that's, you know, maybe a small infestation here.
[21:46.140 --> 21:51.060]  They're, um, you know, I can walk around in the prairie and find spider mites on,
[21:51.060 --> 21:53.380]  um, um, shit.
[21:53.380 --> 21:55.500]  What's that big old plant that makes the tumbleweeds?
[21:55.860 --> 22:01.260]  Um, I can't remember its actual name, but humble weeds just before their tumble
[22:01.300 --> 22:03.020]  weeds, walk out in the prairie and look at one.
[22:03.020 --> 22:04.860]  You could totally find spider mites on it.
[22:04.980 --> 22:05.420]  No, thanks.
[22:05.420 --> 22:05.700]  Your mind.
[22:05.740 --> 22:05.900]  Yeah.
[22:05.900 --> 22:06.140]  Okay.
[22:06.140 --> 22:07.780]  And then it breaks off and blows and
[22:08.020 --> 22:11.020]  then it just comes all down the street and hits the house and
[22:11.060 --> 22:13.220]  we hate tumbleweeds for a whole nother reason.
[22:13.220 --> 22:13.420]  Huh?
[22:13.540 --> 22:13.740]  Yep.
[22:15.500 --> 22:16.700]  Um, yeah.
[22:16.740 --> 22:17.860]  What about those aphids dude?
[22:17.860 --> 22:18.860]  How do we get rid of aphids?
[22:18.860 --> 22:20.980]  I've seen a lot of people popping up with aphids lately.
[22:20.980 --> 22:22.620]  What's your recommendation for aphids?
[22:22.780 --> 22:26.860]  So there's like some crazy aphids in California that I don't know shit about.
[22:26.940 --> 22:29.420]  Um, there it's like a super aphid.
[22:29.780 --> 22:34.780]  Uh, the aphids that I have dealt with here in Colorado is what I call a tomato aphid.
[22:35.260 --> 22:40.500]  Um, and they're the little green fuckers that you find on the stem above the ground.
[22:40.980 --> 22:45.500]  Um, those have never been a big challenge.
[22:45.540 --> 22:47.500]  Um, just BT, um,
[22:47.700 --> 22:48.020]  okay.
[22:48.140 --> 22:49.420]  Bacillus thuringiensis.
[22:49.460 --> 22:50.060]  Yeah, there you go.
[22:50.060 --> 22:50.420]  I got your back.
[22:50.420 --> 22:53.260]  Or, um, uh, what's in the monos, Monterrey spray?
[22:53.260 --> 22:53.700]  Spinosad?
[22:53.780 --> 22:53.980]  Yeah.
[22:53.980 --> 22:54.540]  Spinosad.
[22:54.580 --> 22:54.900]  Excellent.
[22:54.900 --> 22:55.180]  We do it too.
[22:55.220 --> 22:55.460]  Cool.
[22:55.580 --> 22:56.140]  Um,
[22:56.140 --> 22:58.540]  Spinosad is banned by the MED in Colorado.
[22:58.580 --> 22:59.740]  So don't use that one in Colorado.
[22:59.740 --> 22:59.940]  Yeah.
[22:59.940 --> 23:00.140]  Yeah.
[23:00.140 --> 23:00.700]  Bacillus.
[23:00.900 --> 23:01.060]  Yeah.
[23:01.660 --> 23:03.860]  Uh, always, always check before you spray anything.
[23:03.900 --> 23:04.140]  Yeah.
[23:04.140 --> 23:04.380]  Yeah.
[23:04.420 --> 23:05.340]  Don't take our word for it.
[23:05.380 --> 23:06.300]  And that's your job.
[23:06.420 --> 23:06.780]  Yes.
[23:07.380 --> 23:09.460]  That's why you're the lead grower and the pesticide applicator.
[23:09.500 --> 23:09.860]  Yep.
[23:10.620 --> 23:11.180]  Write it down.
[23:12.420 --> 23:13.100]  Check that shit.
[23:13.140 --> 23:17.980]  You're, you're, you're supposed to check it every time before you apply it is,
[23:18.100 --> 23:20.820]  you know, the ultimate safe.
[23:20.820 --> 23:21.340]  Sorry guys.
[23:21.340 --> 23:23.740]  The commercial grow industry has fucking corrupted us.
[23:24.980 --> 23:25.540]  Uh, good work.
[23:25.540 --> 23:26.260]  Good work.
[23:26.300 --> 23:26.860]  Aphids.
[23:26.860 --> 23:27.220]  Aphids.
[23:27.220 --> 23:27.500]  Yeah.
[23:27.740 --> 23:27.980]  Yeah.
[23:27.980 --> 23:33.140]  Spinosad or bacillus, uh, should typically wipe those out.
[23:33.420 --> 23:37.620]  Um, if you find them, look for the ant pile that is probably pretty close to
[23:37.620 --> 23:41.220]  your plants and those bastards probably had something to do with it.
[23:41.700 --> 23:47.940]  Uh, look up the relationship between ants and, uh, and aphids on YouTube.
[23:47.940 --> 23:49.940]  When you're really high someday, it'll blow your mind.
[23:49.980 --> 23:50.700]  They come together.
[23:52.020 --> 23:56.940]  Um, so do you think, uh, should we be applying any pesticides like spray
[23:56.940 --> 23:59.500]  pesticides, outsiders, that's something you try to avoid?
[24:00.100 --> 24:04.780]  Um, in the past I've done like a aloe vera or in the most recent past.
[24:04.820 --> 24:10.820]  Um, I've done like a aloe vera EM one kind of a mixture once a week.
[24:10.860 --> 24:14.660]  Something very gentle, very non-disruptive non-intrusive to the environment.
[24:14.660 --> 24:14.980]  Yeah.
[24:14.980 --> 24:15.220]  Yeah.
[24:15.260 --> 24:17.540]  And I mix in the OHN with that.
[24:17.540 --> 24:22.100]  I got the, um, I did the cheater way and bought this stuff from Chris Trump.
[24:22.100 --> 24:26.900]  So, um, but I mix in a little of that little, that little, that.
[24:27.460 --> 24:31.340]  Um, other things I've used is the, the SNS 207.
[24:31.460 --> 24:35.460]  Um, totally feel safe telling people they can use that once a week.
[24:35.500 --> 24:35.780]  Yeah.
[24:35.980 --> 24:38.900]  Um, and keep in mind, you guys, when you're spraying, you can spray
[24:38.900 --> 24:40.180]  whatever you want on your plants.
[24:40.180 --> 24:41.380]  Jesse and I can't stop you.
[24:41.380 --> 24:45.100]  We can't tell you what to do, but you're also spraying our land.
[24:45.140 --> 24:47.940]  Like I know that that little patch is yours, but it gets into the water.
[24:48.100 --> 24:48.980]  The wind takes it.
[24:49.100 --> 24:50.420]  It's not just your earth.
[24:50.620 --> 24:51.780]  So just be conscious of that.
[24:51.780 --> 24:54.100]  Don't don't fuck up our earth to kind of be cool.
[24:54.100 --> 24:56.100]  Keep leave some for my kids and your kids and shit.
[24:56.180 --> 24:56.740]  Jesse's kids.
[24:56.740 --> 24:59.660]  If he ever has any, just leave some earth for us.
[24:59.900 --> 25:03.940]  If, if you need to use like some really hardcore chemicals outside, you need to
[25:03.940 --> 25:08.780]  like really evaluate what you're doing with your life, um, cause cause growing
[25:08.980 --> 25:10.420]  cannabis outside, it's pretty easy.
[25:10.980 --> 25:11.100]  Yeah.
[25:11.100 --> 25:13.460]  If you, I think if you have a spider mite, whatever eats a spider
[25:13.460 --> 25:14.460]  mite will come and eat that.
[25:14.460 --> 25:16.380]  And then whatever eats that bug should come eat that.
[25:16.380 --> 25:18.860]  You should just have a small roving population of things
[25:18.860 --> 25:20.100]  that eliminate themselves.
[25:20.260 --> 25:23.140]  That's why the cover crop and the mulch is so important.
[25:23.300 --> 25:29.500]  Um, cover crop and mulch around that will build your, your little insect
[25:29.500 --> 25:34.420]  community and, and there's a hierarchy going on, um, of things that eat other
[25:34.420 --> 25:34.980]  things.
[25:35.100 --> 25:40.540]  And, and as soon as you have that in check, um, your, your pest problems
[25:40.540 --> 25:42.780]  are going to diminish, uh, rapidly.
[25:43.020 --> 25:44.940]  So yeah, nature loves to create balance.
[25:45.100 --> 25:47.580]  It loves to, that's kind of one of its favorite things to do.
[25:48.180 --> 25:50.300]  Um, so the small bugs are obvious.
[25:50.300 --> 25:51.020]  We're going to get pests.
[25:51.060 --> 25:54.500]  We're going to get, uh, in Colorado, we get those little fucking caterpillars,
[25:54.500 --> 25:56.740]  the worms, the orange worms that turn into caterpillars.
[25:57.020 --> 25:58.300]  This is the only place I've ever seen.
[25:58.300 --> 25:59.740]  Those is in Pueblo, Colorado.
[25:59.980 --> 26:01.580]  Oh, I've seen them everywhere.
[26:01.580 --> 26:02.060]  Pretty much.
[26:02.060 --> 26:02.340]  Okay.
[26:02.380 --> 26:05.100]  We get those terrible fucking things, but then there are the other things
[26:05.100 --> 26:07.500]  we got to think about things like, uh, and people are going to think I'm
[26:07.500 --> 26:09.260]  crazy, but where we live, this is an option.
[26:09.260 --> 26:11.420]  You can get deer in your weed garden.
[26:11.780 --> 26:13.060]  You can get cats.
[26:13.180 --> 26:13.940]  Cats are common.
[26:13.980 --> 26:15.100]  Uh, cats.
[26:15.180 --> 26:16.260]  How the look on your face, dude.
[26:17.140 --> 26:19.700]  It looks like a couple of cats have gotten one or three of your plants.
[26:19.700 --> 26:20.940]  Um, yeah, yeah.
[26:20.980 --> 26:21.540]  Oh God.
[26:21.540 --> 26:22.220]  More than three.
[26:22.300 --> 26:24.420]  Uh, cats will eat plants when they're young.
[26:24.660 --> 26:29.620]  Um, and it's really frustrating cause they can, the little fat asses
[26:29.620 --> 26:31.060]  just fucking eat the whole thing.
[26:31.100 --> 26:37.580]  Like, uh, squirrels, gophers, they, they also will use your potting soil as a
[26:37.580 --> 26:40.660]  litter box if you're growing in a container.
[26:40.820 --> 26:42.580]  Um, so be aware of that.
[26:42.660 --> 26:42.860]  Yeah.
[26:42.860 --> 26:46.060]  Come outside to your, your no-till bed and find a big old cat deuce in there.
[26:46.260 --> 26:47.020]  Oh yeah.
[26:47.020 --> 26:50.220]  You know, when you're like laying down a couple of pounds of cover crop and, you
[26:50.220 --> 26:54.780]  know, really digging in there and what the fuck's this, oh, it's just not broken up.
[26:55.140 --> 26:56.460]  Oh man.
[26:57.100 --> 26:58.380]  I wish I wouldn't have broke that up.
[26:58.940 --> 26:59.340]  Damn.
[26:59.420 --> 27:02.020]  So how do we keep those larger critters out of our stuff?
[27:02.500 --> 27:04.660]  Um, chicken wire would work good.
[27:04.740 --> 27:05.020]  Okay.
[27:05.100 --> 27:07.100]  You know, something that doesn't hurt anyone.
[27:07.580 --> 27:10.060]  Fucking chicken wire is great for all kinds of shit.
[27:10.060 --> 27:11.660]  Just build like a barrel around it.
[27:11.900 --> 27:12.140]  Yeah.
[27:13.100 --> 27:18.780]  Like in a hundred gallon pot or, you know, um, or you got your, your plan
[27:18.780 --> 27:22.700]  in the hole in the ground, uh, do, do like a three foot, four foot around it.
[27:23.380 --> 27:31.060]  Um, at a certain point, uh, um, deer don't, you know, deer really only an
[27:31.060 --> 27:34.340]  issue when they're, when you're in bed.
[27:34.580 --> 27:37.620]  Um, they, they go for the nice soft new leaves.
[27:38.260 --> 27:42.500]  Um, and when they're really, really small, in my experience, someone
[27:42.500 --> 27:43.460]  may say something different.
[27:43.540 --> 27:43.780]  Right.
[27:44.460 --> 27:45.620]  It's all about that crazy deer.
[27:45.660 --> 27:46.300]  You never know.
[27:46.340 --> 27:46.660]  Yeah.
[27:46.700 --> 27:49.340]  From what I've seen, once they're in flower, you don't really
[27:49.340 --> 27:50.540]  have to worry about them too much.
[27:50.700 --> 27:50.980]  Okay.
[27:51.020 --> 27:57.900]  Um, bears, um, if you use a lot of, uh, good smelling shit or what a bear thinks
[27:57.900 --> 28:02.700]  is good smelling shit, which is like blood mill, fish mill, um, all that kind
[28:02.700 --> 28:08.020]  of stuff, uh, and you're in an area where there are bears, it is very likely
[28:08.020 --> 28:09.300]  they're going to come dig your hole up.
[28:09.580 --> 28:10.420]  I've seen that happen.
[28:10.540 --> 28:11.900]  People may be saying bears.
[28:11.980 --> 28:14.940]  There are bears 25 miles West of us right now.
[28:14.940 --> 28:15.540]  There are bears.
[28:15.540 --> 28:17.100]  Oh hell not even 25 miles.
[28:17.140 --> 28:17.380]  Yeah.
[28:17.420 --> 28:17.700]  Yeah.
[28:17.700 --> 28:18.020]  Okay.
[28:18.020 --> 28:18.180]  Yeah.
[28:18.780 --> 28:20.620]  I've seen bears just down on the river.
[28:21.020 --> 28:21.220]  Yeah.
[28:21.220 --> 28:21.500]  Okay.
[28:21.500 --> 28:21.740]  Yeah.
[28:21.740 --> 28:23.060]  So that's six miles from here.
[28:23.180 --> 28:23.420]  Yeah.
[28:23.620 --> 28:31.420]  Um, uh, yeah, it's really freaky when the bear takes a nap in the, in the hole and,
[28:31.500 --> 28:34.300]  and one of your guys walks into the patch and sees the bear.
[28:35.980 --> 28:36.380]  Ooh.
[28:36.940 --> 28:37.100]  Yeah.
[28:37.100 --> 28:40.220]  I've had a couple, I'm a Colorado one from California, but I'm a Colorado boy now.
[28:40.220 --> 28:43.580]  And I've done a lot of spent a lot of time in the San Isabel national forest.
[28:43.940 --> 28:47.340]  And yeah, bears are some of the scary bears and big cats are the scariest.
[28:47.340 --> 28:47.740]  Fuck yeah.
[28:47.740 --> 28:49.060]  Cats scare the shit out of me.
[28:49.100 --> 28:54.260]  Bears definitely scare me, but we don't have like the crazy huge, you know, fucking
[28:54.260 --> 28:58.060]  Leonardo DiCaprio fucking bears Colorado.
[28:58.060 --> 29:00.620]  But, um, uh, they're definitely still scary.
[29:00.700 --> 29:04.460]  The scariest part is when you see a cat in the mountains, like a Bobcat and
[29:04.500 --> 29:06.060]  then you don't see it anymore.
[29:06.100 --> 29:06.380]  Yeah.
[29:06.460 --> 29:07.140]  That's the worst.
[29:07.140 --> 29:08.220]  Cause you're like, where the fuck did it go?
[29:08.220 --> 29:08.820]  I'm going to die.
[29:08.820 --> 29:09.380]  Where did it go?
[29:09.380 --> 29:10.020]  I'm going to die.
[29:10.380 --> 29:13.420]  Like all you can do is turn on your camera phone and hope to film your own death.
[29:13.580 --> 29:13.820]  Yes.
[29:13.820 --> 29:16.380]  That's what I did because that's how my mind worked.
[29:16.820 --> 29:21.060]  Um, do you think it is beneficial to release beneficial insects outdoors?
[29:21.060 --> 29:23.420]  Or is that something that you should just let nature handle on its own?
[29:24.780 --> 29:26.620]  Um, that's a good question.
[29:26.900 --> 29:30.100]  Uh, do you have an area that will keep beneficial insects?
[29:30.140 --> 29:33.140]  Uh, it would be a question I would ask myself before I did that.
[29:33.300 --> 29:33.620]  All right.
[29:33.700 --> 29:38.900]  Um, if I'm growing in a dirt lot, um, no, and they're not going to hang out
[29:38.900 --> 29:40.060]  on the plants forever either.
[29:40.060 --> 29:44.580]  So, um, yeah, once there's nothing there for them to eat, they die or
[29:44.580 --> 29:45.700]  take off and go find something.
[29:45.700 --> 29:46.380]  They're just like us.
[29:46.380 --> 29:48.060]  They want to get food and get laid.
[29:48.060 --> 29:49.540]  And when that's not happening, they leave.
[29:49.700 --> 29:50.020]  Yeah.
[29:50.060 --> 29:52.580]  They're not going to spend their entire life on the plant.
[29:52.620 --> 29:54.220]  There has to be something else keeping them there.
[29:54.620 --> 29:59.700]  Um, so in some context, it could be great.
[30:00.100 --> 30:02.860]  Um, you know, yeah, sorry.
[30:02.860 --> 30:03.860]  I can't give you a better answer.
[30:03.860 --> 30:03.940]  Cool.
[30:03.940 --> 30:04.340]  No, dude.
[30:04.340 --> 30:05.380]  That's I love it.
[30:05.380 --> 30:08.260]  When somebody can look me in the face and say, I don't know, because that's,
[30:08.260 --> 30:10.740]  that's more respectful than just making some shit up for everybody.
[30:10.740 --> 30:11.380]  That's listening.
[30:11.580 --> 30:13.420]  It would be something I would consider.
[30:13.580 --> 30:16.580]  So if it's in the budget and if you're in the right environment, and I'm sure
[30:16.580 --> 30:20.180]  you can go to many of the websites that offer beneficial insects, you can kind
[30:20.180 --> 30:23.540]  of, they show you what environment they prefer, like if you've got high humidity,
[30:23.540 --> 30:26.460]  don't buy this, if you got high humidity, do buy this one and they'll
[30:26.460 --> 30:27.380]  give you guidance like that.
[30:27.380 --> 30:28.900]  So maybe, maybe if you find the right one.
[30:29.140 --> 30:31.460]  I just wondered if that was because I don't like spraying outside.
[30:31.500 --> 30:33.020]  I really don't like to put sprays.
[30:33.060 --> 30:34.940]  I'm getting away from sprays indoors.
[30:34.940 --> 30:36.340]  I'm starting to not like it so much.
[30:36.900 --> 30:37.140]  Yeah.
[30:37.140 --> 30:40.220]  The, the, and beneficials are cost-effective once you learn how to do it.
[30:40.580 --> 30:43.020]  Uh, you don't lose people think you're throwing them away when you harvest,
[30:43.020 --> 30:45.820]  but if you colonized and veg, I'm getting carried away, but I think
[30:45.860 --> 30:49.220]  beneficials outdoor, if I did outdoor, I'd probably just flood the veg plants
[30:49.220 --> 30:52.340]  indoors and then put them outside and hope they carry through those beneficials.
[30:52.340 --> 30:53.340]  Go right outside with them.
[30:53.580 --> 30:57.300]  I would say that there's a strong, say you have a good environment.
[30:57.420 --> 31:02.140]  Um, there's a strong chance that those beneficials could reproduce and,
[31:02.140 --> 31:03.580]  and come back even the next year.
[31:03.900 --> 31:04.260]  Oh, cool.
[31:04.260 --> 31:06.340]  Um, you know, considering the context.
[31:06.420 --> 31:06.900]  So, right.
[31:07.140 --> 31:10.700]  They just burrow down and lay a bunch of eggs and the legs eggs over winter.
[31:10.700 --> 31:12.820]  And then yeah, maybe Friday next summer.
[31:12.820 --> 31:15.700]  And we got more predators, more security guards working for us.
[31:15.940 --> 31:20.460]  Um, and so something else on beneficials outdoors, um, I've never liked using
[31:20.460 --> 31:24.980]  like the lace wings and some of the bigger insects, um, in, in inside
[31:25.020 --> 31:28.420]  commercial grows because I found that they'll get stuck in the bud.
[31:28.700 --> 31:28.980]  Yeah.
[31:29.020 --> 31:32.220]  And you know, that that's as bad of a problem as a spider might.
[31:32.620 --> 31:38.460]  Um, but outdoors I would feel that's a lot better, um, uh, setting to
[31:38.460 --> 31:40.540]  use some of those bigger ones.
[31:40.820 --> 31:44.460]  The lace wings that come on the cards that are in the eggs that turn into the
[31:44.460 --> 31:48.100]  larvae that look like a little crocodile or a dinosaur when you put them, those
[31:48.100 --> 31:49.660]  things are fucking ferocious.
[31:49.660 --> 31:52.540]  Dude, they will eat the shit out of everything that crawls by them.
[31:52.540 --> 31:53.780]  I highly recommend those.
[31:53.780 --> 31:56.180]  They're expensive, but they work so good.
[31:56.220 --> 31:56.540]  Yeah.
[31:56.780 --> 32:03.380]  Um, they go after the, um, uh, after the, the bud worms too.
[32:03.660 --> 32:04.140]  Oh, good.
[32:04.180 --> 32:04.420]  Yeah.
[32:04.540 --> 32:04.740]  Cool.
[32:04.740 --> 32:07.940]  So, uh, I've seen those bud worms destroy giant plants.
[32:07.940 --> 32:09.980]  They get in there and burrow all through the buds.
[32:10.300 --> 32:15.740]  Um, so we had mentioned that earlier, uh, uh, spinosad or BT sprayed early.
[32:16.140 --> 32:21.300]  Um, though the eggs get laid in those buds when they're, when the buds are
[32:21.300 --> 32:25.140]  only a couple of weeks into flower and then they don't hatch till the end of
[32:25.140 --> 32:25.540]  flower.
[32:25.700 --> 32:29.860]  So, um, they get put there early and they're not a problem till the end.
[32:30.020 --> 32:32.060]  So I've seen people smoke those worms, dude.
[32:32.100 --> 32:32.740]  Oh yeah, dude.
[32:33.140 --> 32:34.100]  They get lit too.
[32:34.740 --> 32:35.660]  Or at least they said they did.
[32:35.660 --> 32:36.380]  I didn't smoke it.
[32:36.820 --> 32:40.540]  So something I didn't realize for years is that those worms actually can cause,
[32:40.580 --> 32:46.700]  um, uh, not just, uh, the disgusting little spot they leave, but they, they
[32:46.700 --> 32:48.580]  cause some kind of bud mold to happen too.
[32:48.820 --> 32:50.180]  Oh, they start infecting that plant.
[32:50.180 --> 32:50.380]  Yeah.
[32:50.380 --> 32:50.540]  Yeah.
[32:50.540 --> 32:50.780]  Yeah.
[32:50.780 --> 32:51.340]  Spread parent.
[32:51.340 --> 32:53.060]  Oh, they're shitting in there and living in there.
[32:53.100 --> 32:53.260]  Yeah.
[32:53.260 --> 32:55.460]  It's a whole nother, it's a parasite in your, in your buds.
[32:55.460 --> 32:56.580]  I can remember.
[32:56.580 --> 33:00.180]  And I may have even said on one of these old podcasts that, uh, oh yeah, I just
[33:00.180 --> 33:01.020]  cut around that.
[33:01.380 --> 33:04.980]  Um, I, now I probably wouldn't recommend that.
[33:05.420 --> 33:07.940]  Isn't it great how much stuff we've learned and how we could just come out and
[33:07.940 --> 33:11.660]  say, oh, so a couple of years ago, I was a dipshit about this move and we've
[33:11.660 --> 33:12.980]  learned that that's not the way to go.
[33:13.940 --> 33:14.420]  I love it.
[33:14.820 --> 33:19.820]  Um, it's empowering to be able to change your point of view and, and to learn new
[33:19.860 --> 33:20.260]  things.
[33:20.340 --> 33:23.540]  It's like the most serious flex you can do for yourself.
[33:23.700 --> 33:24.700]  That's why I didn't write a book.
[33:24.740 --> 33:28.100]  I feel if I wrote a book by the time the book was at the last page, I'd have to
[33:28.100 --> 33:31.100]  just start back over and go, this is all out of date here.
[33:31.100 --> 33:32.300]  We updated this.
[33:32.580 --> 33:33.100]  Like, yeah.
[33:33.300 --> 33:33.900]  Yeah.
[33:34.340 --> 33:34.620]  Yeah.
[33:34.620 --> 33:37.500]  Very well could be some shit I've said about plants that I've grown.
[33:37.500 --> 33:40.180]  I've got a whole episode coming up about led lighting pretty soon.
[33:40.180 --> 33:41.340]  That is going to blow people's minds.
[33:41.620 --> 33:43.820]  Anyway, we're talking about problems we may face.
[33:44.100 --> 33:46.780]  Uh, there's another big problem we have not addressed yet.
[33:46.820 --> 33:48.340]  Uh, cops and thieves, dude.
[33:48.540 --> 33:53.060]  Do you have any advice to keep cops out of the grow and to keep thieves out of the
[33:53.060 --> 33:53.460]  grow?
[33:53.900 --> 34:01.020]  Uh, keep your plants completely non-visible from the street or where other people are.
[34:01.140 --> 34:03.940]  Uh, hide them in your yard as well as you can.
[34:04.460 --> 34:07.700]  Um, uh, make sure your fences are tall.
[34:07.740 --> 34:11.140]  If there's a crack in your fence, uh, people can see in there.
[34:11.580 --> 34:17.020]  Um, and that's the first best thing you can do against both of those things.
[34:17.500 --> 34:20.820]  Um, against cops, you know, keep your numbers down.
[34:21.620 --> 34:25.740]  Um, you know, it's hard to keep thieves away.
[34:25.820 --> 34:31.300]  I've been ripped off, uh, very seriously a couple of times, um, for, for a whole lot
[34:31.300 --> 34:31.980]  of plants.
[34:32.540 --> 34:33.940]  Um, legal limits.
[34:34.420 --> 34:34.780]  Yeah.
[34:34.860 --> 34:35.580]  At the time.
[34:36.140 --> 34:38.900]  Um, yeah, those were the good old days.
[34:38.900 --> 34:39.700]  The good old days.
[34:39.980 --> 34:48.020]  Um, but, uh, you know, there's, there's, uh, don't get a gun involved is something I
[34:48.020 --> 34:48.780]  always preach.
[34:49.180 --> 34:55.260]  Um, you know, you can make your own decisions, but, uh, please never shoot someone
[34:55.260 --> 34:56.740]  that's just still in your plants.
[34:57.140 --> 34:57.940]  Grow more next year.
[34:58.100 --> 34:59.340]  It's, it's a peaceful plant.
[34:59.340 --> 35:00.660]  Let's not put violence into it.
[35:00.900 --> 35:04.900]  I mean, make your own decisions, but, uh, here is definitely what will happen when you
[35:04.900 --> 35:09.620]  go to court is the judge is going to say that you valued a human life more than, or
[35:09.620 --> 35:11.900]  you valued your plant more than a human life.
[35:12.100 --> 35:12.460]  Guilty.
[35:13.140 --> 35:16.700]  And depending on where you are, that plant may be a drug and now it's a drug crime
[35:16.700 --> 35:17.580]  involving a gun.
[35:17.620 --> 35:18.540]  And that's a big old thing.
[35:18.740 --> 35:19.900]  I don't want to take it down that road.
[35:20.060 --> 35:21.580]  Let's have a good time on this podcast.
[35:21.700 --> 35:22.300]  Cops and thieves.
[35:22.300 --> 35:23.420]  You guys, they're out there.
[35:23.420 --> 35:24.100]  They exist.
[35:24.100 --> 35:25.460]  They're looking for your grow.
[35:25.700 --> 35:26.780]  Cops have helicopters.
[35:26.780 --> 35:27.620]  Cops have dogs.
[35:27.620 --> 35:30.380]  Cops have fucking friends that are fucking snitches.
[35:30.380 --> 35:31.540]  That neighbor you think is cool.
[35:31.940 --> 35:32.860]  Might not be so cool.
[35:32.860 --> 35:35.580]  And once he sees you got a big giant pot plant in the fucking backyard.
[35:35.580 --> 35:37.140]  So be kind of discreet, be careful.
[35:37.340 --> 35:38.900]  Also that neighbor you think is cool.
[35:39.220 --> 35:40.540]  He knows when harvest day is.
[35:41.020 --> 35:41.900]  You're telling him about it.
[35:41.900 --> 35:42.700]  You guys are talking about it.
[35:42.700 --> 35:44.900]  You're sitting on the fucking back patio, drinking a beer, bro.
[35:44.900 --> 35:46.660]  In three days, I'm going to cut that fucker down.
[35:46.980 --> 35:48.460]  Suddenly in two days, it's gone.
[35:48.980 --> 35:49.580]  Weird.
[35:49.620 --> 35:52.660]  He knows you go to the lake every night at five o'clock with your dogs.
[35:52.780 --> 35:53.020]  Yep.
[35:53.140 --> 35:54.380]  That people, yes.
[35:54.380 --> 35:57.140]  He knows you're going on vacation in two weeks, you know?
[35:57.220 --> 35:57.500]  Yeah.
[35:57.540 --> 35:58.660]  He's going to cut that shit down.
[35:58.660 --> 36:01.100]  When you go to the lake, he's going to dry it and cure it while you're gone.
[36:01.100 --> 36:05.780]  And then all winter long, he's going to sell you your pot back at fucking 50 bucks
[36:05.780 --> 36:06.300]  an eighth.
[36:07.580 --> 36:08.980]  If he does your bitch.
[36:11.020 --> 36:11.420]  Sorry.
[36:12.940 --> 36:15.100]  That's how some shit just used to go.
[36:15.500 --> 36:15.980]  No, no.
[36:16.020 --> 36:16.340]  Yeah.
[36:16.420 --> 36:16.700]  Yeah.
[36:16.780 --> 36:17.100]  Yeah.
[36:17.180 --> 36:18.580]  Um, old school rules, man.
[36:18.580 --> 36:20.300]  Loose lips, uh, sink ships.
[36:20.380 --> 36:22.540]  Don't tell no one that don't absolutely need to know.
[36:22.860 --> 36:24.020]  That is absolutely true.
[36:24.020 --> 36:24.940]  Don't show the homies.
[36:25.140 --> 36:27.460]  I mentioned on another episode, you're going to want to post
[36:27.460 --> 36:28.740]  pictures on social media.
[36:29.100 --> 36:32.700]  Maybe wait, just if your friends know where your yard is, if you're, if
[36:32.700 --> 36:34.540]  you, if people know what's up, just wait until it's done.
[36:34.540 --> 36:36.260]  You can take pictures all season.
[36:36.580 --> 36:39.220]  And then you've got, when everybody else has done, you've got pictures to
[36:39.220 --> 36:42.420]  post like all winter long, you make, look what I did, look what I did.
[36:42.460 --> 36:44.940]  Never want to be like, oh, I missed my plants and you're still posting.
[36:44.940 --> 36:48.700]  So save the pictures until harvest time, uh, kind of save the pictures until
[36:48.700 --> 36:53.020]  it's dried and cured and in a package somewhere, or, uh, you got money in
[36:53.020 --> 36:54.380]  your pocket, you know what I'm talking about?
[36:54.540 --> 36:56.300]  Just try to be discreet with the social media.
[36:56.300 --> 36:59.100]  If you're not familiar with the game, if you're old school and know what you're
[36:59.100 --> 37:00.780]  doing, do your fucking thing player.
[37:00.780 --> 37:02.220]  But some people are really new with this.
[37:02.220 --> 37:07.580]  Cannabis became legal in a lot of places and it felt like the people who
[37:07.620 --> 37:09.140]  just jumped in when it got legal.
[37:09.260 --> 37:12.460]  Some of them forgot that this was some gangster shit at one point.
[37:12.460 --> 37:15.460]  And you gotta, sometimes you had to play by different rules and
[37:15.460 --> 37:16.500]  you had to live a different way.
[37:16.500 --> 37:18.620]  And so people aren't completely prepared for that.
[37:18.620 --> 37:21.940]  So, uh, this is a valuable product and there are shady people out there that
[37:21.940 --> 37:24.980]  will come get your valuable product and they can put you in harm's way.
[37:25.340 --> 37:27.580]  So keep that in mind when you're doing this sort of shit, you guys.
[37:28.220 --> 37:30.420]  Um, something I want to say on that, please do.
[37:30.580 --> 37:35.540]  Um, I have always wanted to grow weed on like a third story balcony that no one
[37:35.540 --> 37:38.980]  can get to, and you just like totally get to flaunt it and throw your plant
[37:38.980 --> 37:40.500]  out there for the whole world to do.
[37:40.820 --> 37:44.980]  So if you live in one of those situations, will you please do that and send Jeff a
[37:44.980 --> 37:47.820]  pic so that we can admire your handiwork?
[37:48.140 --> 37:53.700]  Or if you've got a three story building, uh, in Oklahoma, Colorado, or good,
[37:53.700 --> 37:57.700]  fancy parts of Mexico near tacos and a beach, uh, Jesse's very interested
[37:57.700 --> 37:58.700]  in your three story building.
[37:59.140 --> 38:04.100]  Uh, we need cultivation permits and good water and fucking a lot of,
[38:04.100 --> 38:05.260]  oh, we don't even need electricity.
[38:05.260 --> 38:06.060]  We just abandoned that.
[38:06.060 --> 38:06.780]  So just need water.
[38:07.340 --> 38:09.540]  And, uh, then we're going to grow the shit out of this
[38:09.540 --> 38:10.660]  building on the third floor.
[38:11.100 --> 38:13.980]  Uh, since we're going to do it this way, we're also going to build a moat.
[38:14.500 --> 38:17.620]  I just want a moat if we're doing this, I want to add a moat, uh,
[38:17.660 --> 38:19.140]  crocodiles in the moat for sure.
[38:19.660 --> 38:21.220]  Do crocodiles and sharks get along?
[38:21.220 --> 38:22.380]  Cause I want a shark in my moat.
[38:22.860 --> 38:23.940]  Um, I don't know.
[38:24.340 --> 38:26.820]  Uh, but we can find all of this out in Mexico.
[38:27.140 --> 38:29.380]  Oh, in Mexico, we can do this, bro.
[38:29.380 --> 38:32.420]  Imagine if I was the shark King, fuck the tiger King, bro.
[38:32.420 --> 38:33.620]  I'm going to get sharks now.
[38:35.620 --> 38:36.740]  I guarantee that dude.
[38:36.740 --> 38:37.460]  Uh, nevermind.
[38:37.660 --> 38:38.020]  All right.
[38:38.300 --> 38:40.380]  The next episode, I've only got one arm and a shark.
[38:41.420 --> 38:42.580]  It's my new friend, snappy.
[38:43.140 --> 38:44.420]  This show got fucking weird.
[38:44.660 --> 38:46.220]  Uh, Jesse's going to light a joint right.
[38:46.220 --> 38:49.220]  As I'm about to ask him a question, something that you guys may want to be
[38:49.220 --> 38:52.220]  aware of, uh, while you're selecting your growing spot, something you may
[38:52.220 --> 38:55.620]  want to think about is a little problem called light pollution.
[38:55.780 --> 38:57.900]  We're all, some of us are out in the fucking country.
[38:57.900 --> 38:59.460]  Some of us I'm right in the middle of the city.
[38:59.460 --> 39:00.940]  I can hear my neighbors when they fart.
[39:00.940 --> 39:02.780]  I can hear the neighbors on that side when they sneeze.
[39:03.100 --> 39:05.660]  Uh, they could probably hear us recording and talking about them right now.
[39:05.980 --> 39:09.060]  Uh, I've got street lights in the front and in the backyard.
[39:09.220 --> 39:11.900]  If you've got too much light, you may have flowering issues.
[39:11.900 --> 39:13.660]  What can we do about light pollution, bro?
[39:13.940 --> 39:16.180]  Uh, BB gun, just shoot out them streetlights.
[39:16.260 --> 39:18.420]  No, I said that on one episode.
[39:18.420 --> 39:21.140]  And you reminded me that when I shoot out that light, they're going to come
[39:21.140 --> 39:24.220]  replace the bulb and then they're going to see my plants in the backyard.
[39:24.220 --> 39:24.500]  Yep.
[39:24.940 --> 39:29.820]  Um, so I used to think light pollution was a lot worse than it is.
[39:30.180 --> 39:35.780]  Um, although I think your genetics play a strong role in it.
[39:35.980 --> 39:41.820]  Um, I have seen a backyard security light, uh, that was actually an HID.
[39:41.820 --> 39:44.660]  I believe, I think it was like one of those one fifties or something like that.
[39:45.140 --> 39:48.740]  Um, I have seen one of those herms that fuck out of like six plants.
[39:48.820 --> 39:49.340]  Oh man.
[39:49.460 --> 39:54.740]  Um, but, uh, in the last couple of years, I've grown some plants outside that are
[39:54.740 --> 39:57.620]  really close to a back porch light and I haven't had any issues.
[39:57.860 --> 39:58.220]  Okay.
[39:58.820 --> 40:00.460]  Um, so it's going to be up to your genetics.
[40:00.460 --> 40:02.100]  You guys, a street light may do it.
[40:02.140 --> 40:05.180]  An led, uh, some led lights are more likely to do it.
[40:05.180 --> 40:06.860]  It sounds like a little back porch light.
[40:06.860 --> 40:09.140]  I agree with Jesse, the porch lights are not going to do much.
[40:09.300 --> 40:09.460]  Yeah.
[40:09.660 --> 40:12.180]  Uh, the thing, a thing happens when the sun sets, it puts
[40:12.180 --> 40:13.500]  off a certain color spectrum.
[40:13.500 --> 40:14.540]  We're not going to go too far into that.
[40:14.540 --> 40:15.420]  Cause I didn't do research.
[40:15.420 --> 40:17.460]  I'm not prepared for the proper terms today.
[40:17.740 --> 40:22.100]  As the sun sets, it puts off a far red spectrum that triggers
[40:22.180 --> 40:23.740]  phytochrome red in your plants.
[40:23.900 --> 40:26.140]  And that tells the plants it's time to go sleepy time.
[40:26.420 --> 40:30.180]  That's why sometimes the plants will start to flower when it is still
[40:30.340 --> 40:33.140]  appearing that we are getting more than 12 hours of light outside.
[40:33.140 --> 40:37.460]  It is because the red spectrum, uh, has told those plants it is sleepy
[40:37.460 --> 40:38.860]  time and they just go to sleep.
[40:38.860 --> 40:41.740]  And when the sun rises, it actually puts off a blue spectrum
[40:41.740 --> 40:42.980]  that does the exact opposite.
[40:43.180 --> 40:45.020]  It's like a little alarm clock for the plants.
[40:45.180 --> 40:47.020]  They start waking up, they get functional.
[40:47.220 --> 40:51.660]  So, uh, light, when they set, when that phytochrome red triggers, I think that
[40:51.660 --> 40:54.940]  most of your outside lights are going to, uh, they're not even going to matter.
[40:54.940 --> 40:55.780]  They're hypnotized.
[40:55.820 --> 40:57.780]  Those plants are just sleeping so hard through that.
[40:58.540 --> 41:02.500]  But for the most part, like if you have like a floodlight and it's like
[41:02.500 --> 41:05.180]  pointing straight at the light, I'd probably move that.
[41:05.260 --> 41:05.540]  Yeah.
[41:05.580 --> 41:07.500]  Um, it is genetics dependent.
[41:07.580 --> 41:10.220]  If you've got don't plant right under the street light on purpose.
[41:10.420 --> 41:13.460]  If you've got the option, kind of go in the darker area, or you may need to
[41:13.460 --> 41:15.740]  think about, and we're going to talk about hoops here, right at the end of this.
[41:15.740 --> 41:18.700]  I'll save a couple of minutes for hoop houses, although you may need to get a
[41:18.700 --> 41:20.340]  hoop house or some sort of coverage for it.
[41:20.620 --> 41:23.100]  If you don't have a good dark area, if you're out in the country,
[41:23.380 --> 41:25.420]  on the moon and all that shit, don't worry about that.
[41:25.420 --> 41:25.900]  Moonlight.
[41:25.900 --> 41:26.940]  That is good for the plants.
[41:26.940 --> 41:28.060]  The moonlight is really good.
[41:28.060 --> 41:28.860]  Don't worry about that.
[41:29.020 --> 41:29.700]  You're on the country.
[41:29.820 --> 41:30.780]  You don't have any problems.
[41:30.980 --> 41:32.860]  Uh, we're in the city here, so we got a lot of light.
[41:32.900 --> 41:34.300]  That may be something you want to think about.
[41:34.900 --> 41:38.020]  Uh, before we start working on hoop houses and stuff, I have a couple of more things.
[41:38.300 --> 41:44.540]  You guys, if you grow from seed, please make sure you do not let any male
[41:44.660 --> 41:47.340]  plants flower outdoors.
[41:47.340 --> 41:49.540]  That is rude as fuck.
[41:49.820 --> 41:54.740]  That is basically as rude as walking up to Jesse and pissing on his shoes.
[41:54.980 --> 41:56.060]  If you, I'm going to punch you.
[41:56.260 --> 41:56.540]  Yeah.
[41:56.620 --> 42:02.220]  And if we find you with a male flowering and your male pollinates my outdoor crop,
[42:03.300 --> 42:07.380]  it is customary that I go to your crop and cut it down and it is now my
[42:07.380 --> 42:09.020]  crop because you fucked up mine.
[42:09.020 --> 42:09.500]  I'm sorry.
[42:09.500 --> 42:10.860]  That's just how it goes.
[42:10.940 --> 42:14.780]  I totally ran a male too long outdoors last year.
[42:16.060 --> 42:20.860]  I live in a kind of isolated area and I know all my neighbors and I knew for a
[42:20.860 --> 42:21.980]  fact, no one was growing.
[42:21.980 --> 42:24.900]  So yeah, that is safe, but I bet.
[42:25.380 --> 42:27.980]  I'm going to guess that there are at least I'm not growing in my backyard.
[42:27.980 --> 42:28.660]  I don't do outdoor.
[42:28.660 --> 42:29.860]  I'm an indoor soldier.
[42:30.140 --> 42:34.260]  Uh, but if I were growing, I would guess there are at least two other people
[42:34.300 --> 42:36.100]  within a mile radius of me growing.
[42:36.140 --> 42:40.580]  I know somebody else on this street with a much different number.
[42:40.580 --> 42:42.940]  His number is way different, but he's on this exact street.
[42:43.260 --> 42:45.540]  He's growing my genetics in his backyard right now.
[42:45.540 --> 42:48.060]  I gave him some orange gas and seeds just recently.
[42:48.420 --> 42:51.500]  So if I were to let a male go, I would pollinate his shit around here.
[42:51.900 --> 42:55.780]  So, and I would probably pollinate two or three other gardens on accident as well.
[42:55.940 --> 42:57.940]  So you guys please be very careful.
[42:57.940 --> 43:01.020]  Don't be like Jesse, don't fuck up and let those males go outdoors too long.
[43:01.020 --> 43:02.820]  If you're isolated, do your thing.
[43:02.820 --> 43:04.740]  If you're breeding outside, do your thing.
[43:04.740 --> 43:08.380]  But, uh, I don't like outdoor breeding because maybe some other guys outdoor
[43:08.380 --> 43:10.940]  breeding down the block and you don't know what male just threw pollen
[43:10.940 --> 43:12.980]  over both of your plants, but be careful.
[43:12.980 --> 43:14.860]  Don't let the males go too long outside.
[43:15.100 --> 43:19.740]  I highly recommend growing clones outdoors or feminized seeds.
[43:19.860 --> 43:22.180]  If you're going to go from a regular seed, please have a good
[43:22.180 --> 43:24.340]  eye on looking for those males.
[43:24.500 --> 43:25.340]  Here's this too.
[43:25.540 --> 43:27.100]  I've bred outdoors.
[43:27.180 --> 43:30.540]  Um, and if that's your thing, it only takes a couple of weeks.
[43:30.580 --> 43:31.820]  It doesn't even take that long.
[43:32.340 --> 43:36.180]  Um, it, the male releases pollen long before you can see it.
[43:36.620 --> 43:39.380]  Um, outdoors, cause it's got the wind blowing on it.
[43:39.420 --> 43:40.940]  The pollen is super fine.
[43:40.940 --> 43:41.740]  It's very light.
[43:41.820 --> 43:44.820]  It's designed to get caught by the wind and be blown away.
[43:45.220 --> 43:50.020]  Um, it, it really doesn't take very long to make your seeds outdoors.
[43:50.340 --> 43:55.020]  So, um, and if you get skilled with it, you can actually nevermind.
[43:56.380 --> 44:00.900]  Um, another thing on outdoor seeds is, uh, if they're purposefully
[44:00.900 --> 44:03.140]  made and they're fully ripened.
[44:03.660 --> 44:06.980]  Uh, they have insanely thick husks.
[44:07.060 --> 44:07.420]  Oh yeah.
[44:08.180 --> 44:12.660]  Um, and you almost need one of those seed crackers or like the matchbox
[44:12.660 --> 44:14.620]  or something, sandpaper or something.
[44:14.620 --> 44:14.900]  Yeah.
[44:14.940 --> 44:16.700]  Those outdoor seeds do get a little rougher.
[44:16.900 --> 44:18.020]  Uh, you can prevent that.
[44:18.060 --> 44:20.460]  Uh, don't let them go as long and that'll kind of, yeah.
[44:20.460 --> 44:21.460]  Just don't let them go as long.
[44:21.460 --> 44:24.420]  I've, I've noticed if I let seeds go too long indoors, they get too hard
[44:24.460 --> 44:25.580]  and you have worse germ rates.
[44:26.420 --> 44:26.700]  Yeah.
[44:26.700 --> 44:27.980]  Just, they just get too bulky.
[44:28.300 --> 44:31.700]  And if I do the more light, I've got more potential to let that happen.
[44:31.700 --> 44:33.100]  That window is much shorter.
[44:33.660 --> 44:37.260]  I've been doing 18 and six toward the end of flower with my seeded plants.
[44:37.260 --> 44:38.100]  I really enjoy that.
[44:39.380 --> 44:41.020]  Uh, more photons, more seed energy.
[44:41.060 --> 44:42.060]  I don't care what the buds look like.
[44:42.060 --> 44:45.180]  They, they re-veg, they start re-vegging at the top, but I don't care.
[44:45.180 --> 44:47.020]  I grind that shit up and throw it away and pull the seeds out.
[44:47.420 --> 44:47.660]  Yeah.
[44:47.820 --> 44:49.780]  Let you move stuff to a different room too.
[44:50.100 --> 44:50.700]  Absolutely.
[44:50.740 --> 44:51.060]  I can.
[44:51.540 --> 44:53.220]  If you know what that means, you know what that means.
[44:53.580 --> 44:56.740]  I'm vegging and flowering in the same room and they're not auto flowers.
[44:56.740 --> 44:57.460]  So crazy.
[44:57.780 --> 45:01.420]  Um, man, we have gone a long way and I've got two things I want
[45:01.460 --> 45:01.780]  to cover.
[45:01.780 --> 45:03.740]  Let's try to cover these really quickly.
[45:04.100 --> 45:07.460]  Uh, everybody wants to know what they should put in their soil.
[45:07.460 --> 45:09.540]  I'm sure that that a lot of people are going to say, if I'm going to grow in
[45:09.540 --> 45:12.340]  these pots, if I'm going to grow outdoors, what are a few things I should put in my
[45:12.340 --> 45:12.820]  soil?
[45:13.060 --> 45:15.780]  So can you give me just a quick list of a few things that would be a good idea to
[45:15.780 --> 45:17.620]  add to my soil mix outside?
[45:17.940 --> 45:22.900]  Um, uh, down to earth makes a product called, um, bio life.
[45:23.100 --> 45:24.620]  I absolutely love that stuff.
[45:24.620 --> 45:25.940]  I just heard about that on another show.
[45:25.980 --> 45:26.460]  Good shit.
[45:26.580 --> 45:26.900]  Yeah.
[45:26.940 --> 45:28.860]  Um, it works great for outdoors.
[45:28.900 --> 45:36.420]  It works great for, um, any plant outdoors, um, tomatoes, chilies.
[45:36.540 --> 45:39.980]  Uh, if you guys follow my Instagram feed, you you've seen the gardens I've grown
[45:39.980 --> 45:42.100]  the last couple of years, and that's been all bio life.
[45:42.580 --> 45:46.780]  Um, you know, what you need is some nitrogen, uh, early.
[45:47.260 --> 45:53.740]  Um, and then late you need high PK, which normally comes from like a guano or, or
[45:53.740 --> 45:55.340]  maybe a compost or something like that.
[45:55.820 --> 45:58.740]  Um, if you don't have access to bio life.
[45:58.980 --> 46:04.340]  Um, uh, the sub cool, super soil recipe works great outdoors.
[46:04.420 --> 46:06.340]  Uh, the builder soil recipe works great.
[46:06.380 --> 46:07.500]  I'm glad you said build a soil.
[46:07.500 --> 46:10.300]  I was going to say, if you're new at building soils, go to the build a
[46:10.300 --> 46:11.980]  soil website and click around.
[46:12.180 --> 46:15.780]  And before too long, you'll be a soil expert or you'll think you are.
[46:15.780 --> 46:17.700]  You'll have a really good idea of what you want to build.
[46:17.700 --> 46:20.940]  They have really good pre-mix starts, and then they give you really
[46:20.940 --> 46:22.380]  good advice on things to add.
[46:22.700 --> 46:25.580]  Uh, they've got a base and a bunch of charge packs you can add to it.
[46:25.900 --> 46:28.420]  Uh, they're, they're really good and educational resource.
[46:28.940 --> 46:33.700]  So I don't know if they still do, but at one point I purchased a pack from them
[46:33.700 --> 46:37.740]  that was kind of blended for Colorado soils, and I just added it to native
[46:37.740 --> 46:40.420]  soil with some peat moss and it worked amazing.
[46:41.340 --> 46:44.140]  And if they don't have that, they have something like Jeff was talking
[46:44.140 --> 46:45.580]  about that is very similar to that.
[46:45.740 --> 46:48.500]  So build a soil, uh, tell them I sent you, they don't pay me at all,
[46:48.500 --> 46:49.740]  but maybe they will one day.
[46:49.940 --> 46:50.180]  Yeah.
[46:50.300 --> 46:51.580]  Um, shout out to Jeremy.
[46:51.980 --> 46:54.540]  A really good compost goes a long way.
[46:54.740 --> 47:02.220]  Um, uh, weekly teas, um, you know, just do a basic tea, um, molasses, um,
[47:02.620 --> 47:07.780]  worm castings, uh, compost, something like that, water aerate, uh, that, that
[47:07.780 --> 47:09.180]  goes a really, really long way.
[47:09.340 --> 47:09.660]  So.
[47:10.620 --> 47:13.020]  Do you, do we really need foam on our compost tea?
[47:13.060 --> 47:13.460]  No.
[47:13.580 --> 47:13.940]  Okay.
[47:13.980 --> 47:14.420]  Thank you.
[47:14.820 --> 47:16.300]  Uh, more likely.
[47:16.700 --> 47:16.940]  Okay.
[47:17.020 --> 47:17.820]  No, keep going wrong.
[47:17.820 --> 47:19.140]  Just more likely than not.
[47:19.580 --> 47:24.580]  Uh, uh, you have foam, uh, your microbes you're trying to propagate
[47:24.580 --> 47:25.860]  are probably stuck in that foam.
[47:26.020 --> 47:27.260]  So, okay.
[47:27.340 --> 47:29.860]  And you want them in solution because when you water, you're not going
[47:29.860 --> 47:31.460]  to water in the foam so much.
[47:31.500 --> 47:31.820]  Okay.
[47:31.980 --> 47:35.860]  Uh, the, the biofilm that you get in your tea is really bad.
[47:36.140 --> 47:36.460]  So.
[47:36.980 --> 47:37.620]  There you go guys.
[47:37.700 --> 47:40.860]  A lot of people are always looking for that foam and I try to tell them, you
[47:40.860 --> 47:43.380]  know, you're not making beer, we're making compost tea.
[47:43.500 --> 47:47.780]  I spent a few months at, um, of looking at compost teas through a microscope.
[47:47.820 --> 47:48.900]  So I like that.
[47:49.260 --> 47:51.220]  It's guys, we have evolved.
[47:51.420 --> 47:52.100]  You did.
[47:52.100 --> 47:56.420]  We've learned so much to hear you say I used a microscope.
[47:56.780 --> 47:57.420]  Damn dude.
[47:57.420 --> 47:58.620]  I got a really nice one.
[47:58.700 --> 47:59.220]  That's awesome.
[47:59.220 --> 47:59.940]  Big old screen.
[47:59.980 --> 48:00.460]  Hell yeah.
[48:00.460 --> 48:00.620]  Dude.
[48:00.620 --> 48:03.100]  I love hooking my little microscope up to the Mac book and taking
[48:03.100 --> 48:04.500]  video bugs, eating bugs.
[48:04.620 --> 48:05.660]  I'll bring it over sometime.
[48:05.820 --> 48:06.420]  Please do.
[48:06.860 --> 48:08.500]  Um, I just threw myself way off track.
[48:08.500 --> 48:12.260]  Oh, um, I remember you recommending things like blood meal, bone meal, fish
[48:12.260 --> 48:16.220]  meal, um, and there was something else that goes in there, worm castings.
[48:16.820 --> 48:17.740]  Those are all great.
[48:18.020 --> 48:18.900]  Worcester shell.
[48:18.980 --> 48:20.700]  Bio life has most of that stuff.
[48:20.700 --> 48:21.020]  Okay.
[48:21.300 --> 48:21.580]  All right.
[48:21.580 --> 48:26.380]  Uh, blood meal, um, that comes from commercial feed lodge shelf.
[48:26.460 --> 48:28.420]  Um, if you're cool with that, then cool.
[48:28.460 --> 48:29.180]  I'd prefer not.
[48:29.220 --> 48:30.820]  Um, I would prefer not.
[48:30.860 --> 48:35.020]  Uh, I, I don't really like eating the beef from those places, so I don't eat that at
[48:35.020 --> 48:35.300]  all.
[48:35.300 --> 48:35.940]  So, yeah.
[48:36.380 --> 48:40.620]  Um, uh, if you can make your own blood meal, that's fucking awesome.
[48:40.700 --> 48:41.780]  And I'm sure that's great.
[48:42.220 --> 48:47.180]  Um, but that's my, my big thing about blood meal and bone meal is, um,
[48:47.740 --> 48:49.820]  is where they come from nasty by-products.
[48:50.060 --> 48:50.260]  Okay.
[48:50.260 --> 48:52.300]  Uh, they're not the best places.
[48:52.300 --> 48:55.540]  The products themselves are okay, but what's commercially available.
[48:56.140 --> 48:58.340]  You know, that's your decision.
[48:58.460 --> 48:58.540]  Yeah.
[48:58.540 --> 48:59.900]  Those are the things that growers think about.
[48:59.900 --> 49:00.460]  You can use it.
[49:00.460 --> 49:01.060]  They it's there.
[49:01.060 --> 49:04.540]  You can use that, or you can choose to use something that's a little more, uh,
[49:04.980 --> 49:06.540]  I don't know, friendly, I guess is the word.
[49:06.740 --> 49:10.980]  In my opinion, there's things that you can use that are better than blood meal.
[49:11.380 --> 49:13.580]  Um, alfalfa meal, it's cheaper.
[49:13.740 --> 49:15.180]  Uh, it's safer.
[49:15.180 --> 49:17.180]  You don't have to worry about it getting in your lungs.
[49:17.380 --> 49:21.780]  Uh, as much, um, it, and it won't heat up your soil.
[49:21.780 --> 49:25.540]  It won't break down as fast like blood mill does a bone meal.
[49:26.020 --> 49:30.300]  Uh, you, you could really stack on some weight with bone meal late season.
[49:30.460 --> 49:35.420]  Um, and it's probably a better replacement for.
[49:35.660 --> 49:39.580]  Juan knows they get mined out of caves in South American countries and then
[49:39.580 --> 49:41.620]  shipped halfway across the world to us.
[49:41.660 --> 49:44.740]  Um, you know, but that's all how you feel about that.
[49:44.900 --> 49:45.100]  So.
[49:45.820 --> 49:48.820]  You've come a long way and you're thinking you really have back in the day.
[49:48.820 --> 49:51.540]  You told me you use fucking back guano and bone meal like that.
[49:51.660 --> 49:51.860]  Yeah.
[49:51.860 --> 49:53.100]  That's kind of the stuff that you would recommend.
[49:53.100 --> 49:54.540]  So I pre no, I appreciate the growth.
[49:54.580 --> 49:54.900]  Yeah.
[49:54.940 --> 50:00.460]  Uh, but, but back one, those can be okay if they're, um, uh, sustainable.
[50:00.580 --> 50:06.260]  Um, uh, the seabird guanos are really fucked up and they're like fucking up
[50:06.260 --> 50:07.820]  nesting grounds and shit like that.
[50:07.860 --> 50:09.420]  And do you know much about that?
[50:09.420 --> 50:11.060]  Can you tell me how that's how that happens?
[50:11.460 --> 50:15.900]  I mean, so the, it gets harvested off the sea cliffs where seabirds, um,
[50:16.260 --> 50:17.900]  not so much going in fucking up their houses.
[50:17.940 --> 50:18.140]  Yeah.
[50:18.140 --> 50:18.340]  Yeah.
[50:18.940 --> 50:23.140]  And you send like a 12 year old up there with a bucket to, you know, it's a pretty
[50:23.140 --> 50:24.620]  fun, no masks, no shoes.
[50:24.780 --> 50:25.860]  I'm just being hypothetical.
[50:25.860 --> 50:26.780]  It's probably, yeah.
[50:26.940 --> 50:27.140]  Yeah.
[50:27.140 --> 50:27.540]  No, no.
[50:28.100 --> 50:28.980]  They don't care about them.
[50:29.020 --> 50:29.820]  So there's, yeah.
[50:30.060 --> 50:32.900]  And it really sucks because seabird guano makes them very tasty.
[50:32.900 --> 50:33.620]  Yeah, it does.
[50:33.620 --> 50:37.220]  That's why I use a couple of products that I use because it contains seabird guano.
[50:37.500 --> 50:41.260]  I think that kelp and seabird guano make your plants taste and smell super delicious.
[50:41.300 --> 50:41.780]  Oh yeah.
[50:41.780 --> 50:42.980]  Kelp kelp is awesome.
[50:43.260 --> 50:43.540]  Yeah.
[50:44.020 --> 50:48.460]  Uh, it's time to get a little bit more mindful on what we're doing to not only
[50:48.460 --> 50:51.380]  to our plants and to the people consuming the plants, but to the other end of that,
[50:51.380 --> 50:52.940]  what are we doing to the environment?
[50:52.940 --> 50:56.340]  Where are we sourcing our feeds, our nutrients, our minerals, our
[50:56.340 --> 50:58.340]  pesticides, our predator bugs.
[50:58.700 --> 51:02.620]  Uh, those are things that I feel now that I see the evolution in you over the
[51:02.620 --> 51:03.740]  time that we've been hanging out.
[51:04.060 --> 51:06.980]  Uh, now that we're, I hate to say that, like we're established growers.
[51:06.980 --> 51:08.660]  We've got a good fucking, we're black belts, bro.
[51:08.820 --> 51:12.940]  Now it is time to start thinking more ethically and environmentally conscious
[51:12.940 --> 51:15.140]  and thinking about things like that and start teaching how to do that sort of
[51:15.140 --> 51:17.740]  stuff is probably one of our next responsibilities.
[51:18.100 --> 51:18.580]  Definitely.
[51:18.620 --> 51:22.940]  And, uh, you know, that's, we all know what it's like to, another thing just to
[51:22.940 --> 51:28.780]  add on top of all of that, uh, is the labor that the people that are, um, uh,
[51:28.780 --> 51:32.300]  we all know what it's like to be underpaid and underappreciated.
[51:32.380 --> 51:36.300]  Um, and you can just imagine it's even worse for them.
[51:36.380 --> 51:36.660]  So.
[51:36.980 --> 51:38.740]  Yeah, dude, scraping up bat guano.
[51:38.740 --> 51:38.980]  Yeah.
[51:39.220 --> 51:40.300]  That sounds miserable.
[51:40.580 --> 51:40.820]  Yeah.
[51:40.900 --> 51:42.260]  Surely there's something else.
[51:42.300 --> 51:45.700]  Uh, they can just start making cocoa for us.
[51:46.180 --> 51:50.420]  So, but then if we have them stop doing bat guano, do we cut out a job for
[51:50.420 --> 51:54.500]  somebody to say, yeah, that's fucked up situation.
[51:54.500 --> 51:55.620]  They got to shred cocoa now.
[51:55.620 --> 51:59.860]  And then when Americans meddle in a third world politics, yeah.
[52:00.460 --> 52:00.620]  Yeah.
[52:00.620 --> 52:01.620]  Let's stick to what we know.
[52:01.660 --> 52:03.020]  Let's talk about hoop houses.
[52:03.020 --> 52:05.700]  A moment ago, we said we should put some sort of protection out for the
[52:05.700 --> 52:07.180]  plants if we've got the opportunity.
[52:07.540 --> 52:10.820]  Uh, let's try to spend about seriously two to three minutes just talking
[52:10.820 --> 52:14.300]  about building a quick, easy hoop house that would protect our plants.
[52:14.380 --> 52:14.780]  Yeah.
[52:14.860 --> 52:15.540]  Um, okay.
[52:15.540 --> 52:22.020]  So go to a website called Johnny C dot com.
[52:22.420 --> 52:23.540]  Yeah, pretty sure that's it.
[52:23.980 --> 52:27.060]  Um, uh, just type in Johnny seed.
[52:27.100 --> 52:30.820]  They sell like flower seeds and farm tools and all that kind of stuff.
[52:31.420 --> 52:33.060]  And for about four comes up immediately.
[52:33.060 --> 52:34.820]  You'll find it for about 40 bucks.
[52:34.820 --> 52:41.300]  They sell a thing called a hoop vendor and you can take a $4 piece of, um, um,
[52:41.500 --> 52:43.740]  it's a PVC, uh, con metal conduit.
[52:43.820 --> 52:44.340]  Oh, cool.
[52:44.540 --> 52:49.540]  And in about 30 seconds, make yourself a, uh, whatever size hoop you need, um,
[52:49.580 --> 52:52.140]  according to whatever size hoop vendor you bought.
[52:52.620 --> 52:57.900]  Um, and these hoops will last forever cause it's galvanized, uh, metal.
[52:58.340 --> 53:02.140]  Um, unlike the PVC, which typically just last a year or two.
[53:02.580 --> 53:06.100]  Um, so that's, I've recently switched those.
[53:06.220 --> 53:07.260]  Um, I love them.
[53:07.660 --> 53:08.740]  They're stronger.
[53:08.900 --> 53:10.740]  You don't have to drive the stake in the ground.
[53:11.340 --> 53:12.380]  Um, okay.
[53:12.500 --> 53:15.260]  Cause there already been a bunch of people probably feel like I just
[53:15.260 --> 53:16.580]  get passed a whole bunch of stuff.
[53:18.300 --> 53:18.580]  It's all right.
[53:18.580 --> 53:19.180]  We'll back up.
[53:19.340 --> 53:20.620]  So I like, yeah.
[53:20.700 --> 53:23.020]  So we're buying, uh, basically arches.
[53:23.060 --> 53:25.100]  We're buying a machine that'll bend some arches for us.
[53:25.100 --> 53:26.460]  We're going to make some golden arches.
[53:26.580 --> 53:26.740]  Yeah.
[53:26.740 --> 53:30.380]  We've got little, little bends and then align them in a row to where you
[53:30.380 --> 53:31.740]  can basically make a tent, right?
[53:31.900 --> 53:32.180]  Yeah.
[53:32.180 --> 53:38.940]  So say you planted your three cannabis plants in a straight row or, or, uh,
[53:38.980 --> 53:43.740]  say you got six and there are two rows of three, so you'd run a one, two, three,
[53:43.740 --> 53:47.820]  four, uh, four or five of these hoops all the way down one row.
[53:48.300 --> 53:51.020]  And then you can cover it with plastic late in the season.
[53:51.020 --> 53:57.140]  If you get rain or super cold or, um, or even if dust is a, is a problem.
[53:57.300 --> 53:57.460]  No.
[53:57.460 --> 53:57.780]  Yeah.
[53:57.860 --> 53:58.100]  Yeah.
[53:59.100 --> 54:00.420]  Uh, put a tarp over it.
[54:00.420 --> 54:01.620]  If you want to make it dark in there.
[54:01.620 --> 54:02.220]  You can do that.
[54:02.220 --> 54:03.660]  You can speed up your season a little bit.
[54:04.020 --> 54:05.780]  Um, for not a lot of money.
[54:05.900 --> 54:09.940]  What I, what I have been doing the last couple of years is, is I have.
[54:10.620 --> 54:11.260]  Tall hoops.
[54:12.140 --> 54:15.860]  Um, and you guys, Jesse's six foot something and he just reached above his
[54:15.860 --> 54:19.060]  head, so he meant tall, it was like seven feet is where he reached seven and a
[54:19.060 --> 54:20.140]  half feet, something like that.
[54:20.540 --> 54:23.140]  Um, and I run plastic over the top.
[54:23.220 --> 54:24.820]  Uh, I've got what they call wiggle wire.
[54:25.220 --> 54:27.700]  Um, you can buy that at Johnny's too.
[54:28.100 --> 54:31.780]  Um, and it's attached to the, to the hoops.
[54:31.780 --> 54:36.860]  It runs about two thirds of the way down, leaves plenty of airflow down at the
[54:36.860 --> 54:41.540]  bottom, um, keeps the moisture and shit from, you know, getting on the buds.
[54:41.620 --> 54:42.180]  Works great.
[54:42.220 --> 54:43.140]  I leave the ends open.
[54:43.140 --> 54:44.500]  So there's plenty of airflow in there.
[54:45.180 --> 54:47.140]  Um, yeah, that sounds real easy.
[54:47.300 --> 54:50.540]  Uh, you guys, so basically we're just building arches and putting a row of
[54:50.540 --> 54:52.860]  arches and draping some plastic over it.
[54:52.900 --> 54:56.840]  It's where the hail and the rain kind of bounce off of that plastic instead of
[54:56.840 --> 54:58.800]  destroying our precious plants.
[54:59.120 --> 55:01.700]  Uh, I'm sure if you're interested in building a hoop house, it's a really good
[55:01.700 --> 55:04.160]  idea if you're interested in doing that, I'm sure you're going to do more research
[55:04.160 --> 55:05.840]  than just listening to this podcast on that.
[55:06.040 --> 55:09.520]  But you can build you a real nice, uh, late season cover for just a couple
[55:09.520 --> 55:13.280]  hundred dollars, and if you put a little time in it, it'll be like some serious
[55:13.280 --> 55:15.440]  IG flex, so there you go.
[55:15.560 --> 55:16.040]  There you go.
[55:16.080 --> 55:16.800]  It's well worth it.
[55:16.920 --> 55:18.720]  Uh, you'll get some almost free cannabis.
[55:18.720 --> 55:22.000]  It takes a lot of labor and effort, but other than that, it's almost free
[55:22.000 --> 55:25.880]  cannabis and also put some vegetables in there, maybe set up another one and grow
[55:25.920 --> 55:27.720]  some food, don't just grow ganja out there.
[55:27.720 --> 55:28.160]  Definitely.
[55:28.320 --> 55:31.040]  And you know, um, let's go back to the cops.
[55:31.120 --> 55:33.560]  Um, uh, do we have to, yeah.
[55:34.840 --> 55:36.920]  Another thing that helps keep them away.
[55:37.440 --> 55:42.240]  Um, and nosy neighbors away is if you grow a whole bunch of other stuff, um, and you
[55:42.240 --> 55:46.760]  do it out in the open where everyone can see it, it, it works very well.
[55:46.800 --> 55:47.880]  I can promise you.
[55:48.120 --> 55:51.360]  I have a, we call them the old crazy guy, but I have a friend shout
[55:51.360 --> 55:52.360]  out if you're listening, Gary.
[55:52.560 --> 55:56.320]  I have an old friend who had a greenhouse and he would honestly grow
[55:56.320 --> 55:59.840]  nothing but ganja in the greenhouse and the greenhouse that had walls on it.
[55:59.840 --> 56:03.760]  So you couldn't see in, but he would go to the store and buy large amounts of
[56:03.760 --> 56:06.280]  vegetables and just go to the neighbors and be like, here, we grew a bunch of
[56:06.280 --> 56:07.680]  extra zucchini, here you go.
[56:07.960 --> 56:09.320]  So he was doing a double service.
[56:09.320 --> 56:12.280]  He would go to the farmer's market and just buy out all of your zucchinis.
[56:12.280 --> 56:12.880]  You know what I mean?
[56:13.120 --> 56:15.520]  And then go tell somebody else he grew them and just pass them out to the
[56:15.520 --> 56:18.000]  neighbors and now the neighborhood thinks he just grew a bunch of zucchini.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.160]  The farmer sold out and Gary's got cover.
[56:20.400 --> 56:21.400]  It worked beautifully.
[56:21.760 --> 56:23.600]  I ended up with all kinds of vegetables and shit.
[56:23.640 --> 56:24.720]  The neighbors didn't want these.
[56:24.720 --> 56:25.160]  You want them?
[56:25.160 --> 56:25.680]  Yeah, dude.
[56:27.000 --> 56:27.160]  Yeah.
[56:27.160 --> 56:29.680]  Gary was a cool guy and he was growing some good herb in that greenhouse.
[56:29.680 --> 56:32.600]  So beautiful cover, beautiful, beautiful cover plan.
[56:32.840 --> 56:34.920]  That was when people were really, really paranoid.
[56:37.400 --> 56:38.600]  You guys be paranoid.
[56:38.720 --> 56:41.640]  It's we've gotten a little complacent and a little silly here.
[56:41.760 --> 56:45.040]  Uh, I'm not sure where you are, but let's not get too carried away.
[56:45.240 --> 56:45.560]  It is.
[56:45.760 --> 56:47.920]  There are rules to growing outdoors in Colorado.
[56:48.080 --> 56:48.840]  Follow the rules.
[56:48.840 --> 56:49.280]  That's something.
[56:49.280 --> 56:50.280]  And we'll talk about the cops.
[56:50.280 --> 56:50.920]  Follow the rules.
[56:50.920 --> 56:53.120]  You're an adult, do what you want, but if you follow the rules, you
[56:53.120 --> 56:54.240]  shouldn't get yourself in trouble.
[56:54.360 --> 56:57.040]  It's worth your time to know them and know them really well.
[56:57.160 --> 57:00.960]  Um, maybe not so much here in Pueblo, but other parts of the state.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.120]  I'm sure there are still cops that don't know, and that could
[57:04.120 --> 57:05.360]  be a good thing and a bad thing.
[57:05.880 --> 57:10.520]  Um, and if it's turning into a bad thing and you know, they're wrong.
[57:10.920 --> 57:15.480]  It's very good for you to, uh, cause they make split second decisions and
[57:15.480 --> 57:16.760]  they're like, fuck it, we're chopping them.
[57:18.200 --> 57:20.280]  It's not like they come back three days later.
[57:20.800 --> 57:22.040]  And they were totally wrong.
[57:22.480 --> 57:28.680]  And, you know, so if you're within your legal limits, know them and flex them.
[57:29.000 --> 57:29.400]  Yes.
[57:29.680 --> 57:30.080]  Yes.
[57:30.440 --> 57:30.960]  No, you're right.
[57:30.960 --> 57:31.360]  You guys.
[57:31.920 --> 57:35.520]  Um, but I think that is all of the notes I wrote down for outdoor cultivation.
[57:35.520 --> 57:37.840]  You just lit up a joint that smells delicious over there.
[57:38.360 --> 57:41.040]  Uh, do you, do you have anything you would like to add to an outdoor
[57:41.040 --> 57:42.840]  cultivation before we start wrapping up the show?
[57:44.600 --> 57:46.760]  Um, no.
[57:47.480 --> 57:47.920]  All right.
[57:48.040 --> 57:48.320]  Yeah.
[57:48.720 --> 57:54.800]  Uh, grow good genetics, uh, uh, plants from seed just absolutely kill it outdoors.
[57:55.240 --> 57:57.600]  Uh, I think it's, they've got the taproot.
[57:57.920 --> 58:03.760]  I'm not sure if, but for some reason, uh, seeded plants just murder it outdoors.
[58:03.760 --> 58:07.960]  So they just love to go and sunshine is the most amazing thing for anybody in
[58:07.960 --> 58:09.600]  anything, go get some sunshine on your face.
[58:09.600 --> 58:12.640]  You guys get outside after the quarantine, make sure you get all your clones
[58:12.640 --> 58:16.280]  chopped too, um, uh, before the end of July.
[58:16.600 --> 58:19.240]  So yeah, because it will go into flower and you're going to wish you
[58:19.240 --> 58:21.240]  had those amazing genetics again.
[58:22.320 --> 58:24.600]  I have done an episode on revenge just in case.
[58:25.120 --> 58:26.400]  All right, Jesse, thanks for hanging out.
[58:26.400 --> 58:27.240]  Do that smells good.
[58:27.360 --> 58:28.880]  Uh, I'm ready for a dab myself.
[58:29.080 --> 58:30.560]  Uh, we got to get you on the show more often.
[58:30.880 --> 58:31.280]  For sure.
[58:31.280 --> 58:31.680]  For sure.
[58:31.880 --> 58:33.960]  Uh, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes.
[58:34.040 --> 58:36.680]  Oh, before we do this part, bro, how can people find you on social media?
[58:36.960 --> 58:40.560]  Uh, check me out at, uh, uh, Jesse grows on IgG.
[58:41.000 --> 58:42.040]  Jesse grows on IgG.
[58:42.040 --> 58:45.040]  You guys, if you were watching the space force episode, those photos of
[58:45.040 --> 58:48.160]  space force I posted were grown by Jesse.
[58:48.760 --> 58:49.400]  She's a good one.
[58:49.560 --> 58:50.320]  She's a good one.
[58:50.880 --> 58:51.960]  That's all he's going to say about that.
[58:51.960 --> 58:52.520]  And that's all we need.
[58:52.560 --> 58:53.120]  She's a good one.
[58:53.120 --> 58:55.960]  Jesse's a discerning grower and he's got a lot to choose through.
[58:55.960 --> 58:58.480]  So if he says she's a good one, that, that means a lot.
[58:58.800 --> 58:59.080]  Yeah.
[58:59.160 --> 59:02.560]  I mean, not, you know, whatever Jeff's stuff's really good.
[59:02.640 --> 59:04.000]  Like it's not just type.
[59:04.080 --> 59:05.840]  I actually feel like he gets slept on a lot.
[59:06.000 --> 59:09.000]  Um, so, uh, grow, grow that shit out.
[59:09.040 --> 59:09.640]  It's fun to grow.
[59:09.760 --> 59:10.440]  I appreciate that.
[59:10.440 --> 59:10.720]  Thank you.
[59:10.720 --> 59:12.680]  There's my brown nose and my time is coming, bro.
[59:12.800 --> 59:14.320]  Uh, they were sleeping for a while.
[59:14.360 --> 59:18.440]  Uh, that's, uh, I I'm glad that they slept because I had to earn my spot.
[59:18.440 --> 59:22.840]  I feel like anybody one hit wonders come and go and people that take a while to
[59:22.840 --> 59:24.480]  pop up, they stick around for a while.
[59:24.480 --> 59:26.320]  So I'm glad I went slow and steady.
[59:26.360 --> 59:27.160]  That wins the race.
[59:27.200 --> 59:27.640]  That's true.
[59:27.720 --> 59:28.200]  That's true.
[59:28.320 --> 59:33.800]  And, and you're better equipped to handle the production needs and the
[59:33.800 --> 59:35.320]  success at this point in your life too.
[59:35.720 --> 59:36.360]  Exactly.
[59:36.400 --> 59:39.480]  And I had a lot of mentors that showed me what to and what not to do.
[59:39.480 --> 59:40.760]  So I'm glad I took my time.
[59:41.680 --> 59:42.360]  Uh, dude, thank you.
[59:42.400 --> 59:43.200]  Good conversation.
[59:43.400 --> 59:43.680]  Yeah.
[59:43.680 --> 59:44.040]  Awesome.
[59:44.040 --> 59:44.760]  Thanks for having me.
[59:44.840 --> 59:45.400]  For sure, bro.
[59:45.400 --> 59:46.200]  Anywhere else they can find you.
[59:46.200 --> 59:47.400]  I kind of cut you off on your plugs.
[59:47.520 --> 59:48.560]  Uh, Jesse grows.

[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.480]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy lemur priest.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.600]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:29.600]  Sweet.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:30.320]  Oh yeah.

[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.440]  I got a little sip.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.440]  So she gave me lip.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:45.720]  Lip.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.440]  Then we get a stop.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:46.920]  We're in a notch.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.760]  She's on my price.

[01:02:58.490 --> 01:02:59.810]  Goldman slaps it around.
[01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:00.970]  You take a stand and you can do it.
[01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:02.090]  You get right to it.
[01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:02.890]  Case in a place.
[01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:03.970]  Well, we went right through it.
[01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:08.830]  You gotta do it.
[01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:10.150]  Don't get a single girl.
[01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:15.970]  And if you got Bibi, get all y'all.
[01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:16.490]  Chuck it.

[01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:20.770]  I see it.
[01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:21.290]  I'm thinking.
[01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:21.770]  I see it.
[01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:27.500]  Come on, everybody.
