[00:00.000 --> 00:01.360]  Yo, what up podcast world?
[00:01.360 --> 00:05.520]  It's Rasta Jeff and it's Thursday, so that means it's time for another throwback Thursday
[00:05.520 --> 00:08.440]  episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:08.440 --> 00:11.980]  Before I get into the block of old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.

[00:16.520 --> 00:17.520]  all expired.
[00:17.520 --> 00:22.360]  There are currently no contests, no promotions, no advertising, or no giveaways.
[00:22.360 --> 00:24.880]  Also, let me update all of the social media.
[00:24.880 --> 00:29.960]  If you want to find me on Twitter, you can find me at GFYH Podcast on Twitter, on Facebook,
[00:29.960 --> 00:32.240]  simply search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[00:36.760 --> 00:39.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoy these chunks of old episodes.
[00:39.720 --> 00:43.520]  Here we go with a throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:43.520 --> 00:45.880]  Hey everybody, Rasta Jeff here.
[00:45.880 --> 00:49.080]  Before I start the podcast, I want to send love and respect to all of the victims of
[00:49.080 --> 00:50.360]  the Planned Parenthood shooting.
[00:50.360 --> 00:54.120]  I also want to send a huge thank you to all of the law enforcement that helped rescue
[00:54.120 --> 00:55.160]  those people.
[00:55.160 --> 00:56.160]  Thank you.
[00:56.160 --> 01:13.780]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[01:13.780 --> 01:17.860]  It's time for episode number 108 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[01:17.860 --> 01:19.380]  news, education, and conversation.
[01:19.380 --> 01:23.860]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[01:23.860 --> 01:27.580]  or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[01:27.580 --> 01:32.820]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[01:32.820 --> 01:34.380]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:34.380 --> 01:36.020]  I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[01:36.020 --> 01:39.660]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for letting
[01:39.660 --> 01:41.540]  me use their music on my show.
[01:41.540 --> 01:46.100]  Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:46.100 --> 01:50.300]  Also you guys, this podcast is brought to you by our good friends at Hitman Glass.
[01:50.300 --> 01:52.580]  Hitman Glass, made in America by Americans.
[01:52.580 --> 01:56.180]  When I'm shopping for a new rig, I like to know that what I'm paying for is going to
[01:56.180 --> 01:57.740]  give me a nice fat dab.
[01:57.740 --> 01:58.740]  And you know what?
[01:58.740 --> 02:00.780]  I can always rely on Hitman Glass.
[02:00.780 --> 02:04.980]  Don't trust your dab to a rig made in China by a Chinese child without proper eye protection
[02:04.980 --> 02:06.500]  or adequate pay.
[02:06.500 --> 02:10.140]  Buy yourself some glass made in America by folks who dab as hard as you.
[02:10.140 --> 02:12.260]  Hitman Glass is not only a glass company, you guys.
[02:12.260 --> 02:15.420]  Hitman Dougie is a huge part of the cannabis hash movement.
[02:15.420 --> 02:18.820]  Support Hitman Glass and be sure to check out the Chalice Festival in California.
[02:18.820 --> 02:20.700]  Go follow Hitman Glass on Instagram.
[02:20.700 --> 02:22.540]  Search for Hitman Glass Dougie and give them a follow.
[02:22.540 --> 02:26.100]  And be sure to visit hitmanglass.com today.
[02:26.100 --> 02:30.180]  You guys, tonight as we record, I'm hitting my Hitman E-Series sidecar.
[02:30.180 --> 02:34.740]  This is my first Hitman rig and I have been impressed since my first rip out of any Hitman
[02:34.740 --> 02:35.740]  rig.
[02:35.740 --> 02:36.740]  Shout out to Hitman Glass and Dougie.
[02:36.740 --> 02:39.020]  You know, I can remember the first time I hit a Hitman rig.
[02:39.020 --> 02:43.140]  I hit a Hitman sidecar with my homie Hank.
[02:43.140 --> 02:44.460]  We may have been in his car.
[02:44.460 --> 02:46.060]  I don't know nothing about that.
[02:46.060 --> 02:50.020]  But a big shout out to my buddy Hank for introducing me to the world of Hitman Glass.
[02:50.020 --> 02:52.260]  I have not looked back since then.
[02:52.260 --> 02:56.580]  You guys, I know everybody likes a nice custom rig, a nice colorful rig made by some fancy
[02:56.580 --> 02:57.580]  artist.
[02:57.580 --> 03:01.540]  It's always great to have in your collection, but sometimes you pay a bunch of money and
[03:01.540 --> 03:04.980]  you go to hit that rig and when you put water in it, the first time you go to draw through
[03:04.980 --> 03:06.540]  it, you get water in your mouth.
[03:06.540 --> 03:09.300]  Every time you try to take a dab, you get water in your mouth because the water level
[03:09.300 --> 03:13.420]  has to be just at this awkward level to where when you hit it, you get water in your mouth
[03:13.420 --> 03:16.060]  or you can put a little less water and not get any bubbles.
[03:16.060 --> 03:17.620]  That never happens with a Hitman rig.
[03:17.620 --> 03:20.860]  When you buy a Hitman rig, it is always going to hit like a fucking truck.
[03:20.860 --> 03:23.380]  So I recommend Hitman Glass.
[03:23.380 --> 03:25.940]  Let's uh, let's quit rambling about glass and let's take a dab.
[03:25.940 --> 03:28.140]  You guys, today we're going to hit the Hitman E-Series sidecar.
[03:28.140 --> 03:29.900]  I've got a highly educated domeless nail.
[03:29.900 --> 03:31.100]  I'm going to heat this sucker up.
[03:31.100 --> 03:32.380]  We're going to do it old school.
[03:32.380 --> 03:34.780]  I'm going to use a torch and not use the E-Nail today.
[03:35.300 --> 03:38.380]  I'm sitting in a different location, so I don't have the E-Nail right here, but I'm
[03:38.380 --> 03:41.340]  heating this nail up, getting it nice and hot, and we're going to take a dab together
[03:41.340 --> 03:44.260]  and then we're going to get on with this podcast.
[03:44.260 --> 03:46.260]  So you guys, I hope you've got a dab ready.
[03:46.260 --> 03:48.860]  I hope wherever you are, whatever you're doing, you're smoking something tasty.
[03:48.860 --> 03:50.260]  Let's take a dab together.
[03:50.260 --> 03:54.340]  This dab, you guys, goes out to Hitman Glass and the entire Hitman crew.
[03:54.340 --> 03:55.340]  Let's take a dab.
[03:55.340 --> 03:56.340]  Here we go.
[03:56.340 --> 04:03.480]  Yeah.
[04:03.480 --> 04:09.120]  That was my first rig and I love the way it hits.
[04:09.120 --> 04:12.960]  Shout out to the Hitman crew.
[04:12.960 --> 04:14.800]  I'm carb capping and freestyle rapping.
[04:14.800 --> 04:17.760]  You guys, I've got a whole bunch of stuff that I want to talk about in this podcast,
[04:17.760 --> 04:20.160]  so let's get down to business a little bit.
[04:20.160 --> 04:26.600]  I need to mention that my Instagram account, the Iree Genetics Instagram account, was at
[04:26.600 --> 04:30.280]  19,000 followers and Instagram shut that thing down.
[04:30.280 --> 04:32.920]  So big middle finger to Instagram for that.
[04:32.920 --> 04:35.080]  What I would like you to do is follow my new account.
[04:35.080 --> 04:37.400]  It's Iree underscore genetics.
[04:37.400 --> 04:38.880]  So I've got a new account going.
[04:39.640 --> 04:40.640]  I've been posting a few pictures.
[04:40.640 --> 04:43.200]  I've got close to a thousand followers again.
[04:43.200 --> 04:45.000]  Excuse my cough.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.200]  So please go support the new Iree Genetics Instagram page.
[04:48.200 --> 04:51.560]  It looks like they're out to get the entire cannabis community.
[04:51.560 --> 04:56.760]  What I read today was as long as you don't post pictures of yourself using cannabis,
[04:56.760 --> 05:00.560]  you can post pictures of your plants and of your rigs and of your hash and of your buds.
[05:00.560 --> 05:04.800]  You just can't post pictures of yourself smoking is what somebody tried to tell me today.
[05:04.800 --> 05:06.320]  Excuse my coughing.
[05:06.320 --> 05:07.320]  I did just take a fat dab.
[05:07.760 --> 05:08.760]  And you know what?
[05:08.760 --> 05:11.400]  It seems true because the accounts that are getting deleted are people smoking and the
[05:11.400 --> 05:15.200]  accounts that are still there, they don't have images of them smoking.
[05:15.200 --> 05:16.720]  So I'm going to try to stick with that.
[05:16.720 --> 05:21.520]  I'll just be posting pictures of plants, pictures of me at work, pictures of stuff like that,
[05:21.520 --> 05:25.120]  but I won't be posting dab videos and dab pictures to Instagram anymore.
[05:25.120 --> 05:27.240]  I apologize.
[05:27.240 --> 05:31.400]  So yeah, make sure you follow the new Iree Genetics Instagram.
[05:31.400 --> 05:35.040]  Also I want to send a huge shout out to my friend Seb.
[05:35.080 --> 05:38.320]  I'm not sure if you want me to say your whole name on the podcast, but big shout out to
[05:38.320 --> 05:40.120]  my friend Seb from Australia.
[05:40.120 --> 05:43.000]  You guys have been talking about the donation button on the podcast page.
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.760]  If you go to the website, ireegeneticscolorado.com, go to the podcast tab, there is a PayPal button
[05:48.760 --> 05:50.000]  on the top right.
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.640]  That is a donation button and every donation you make goes directly to my PayPal account.
[05:54.640 --> 05:59.760]  You guys, our friend Seb from Australia sent me a nice donation and I really want to give
[05:59.760 --> 06:01.600]  you a huge thank you shout out.
[06:01.600 --> 06:02.760]  Dude, thank you.
[06:02.760 --> 06:03.760]  That was amazing.
[06:03.760 --> 06:04.920]  That's a huge contribution.
[06:04.920 --> 06:06.480]  I absolutely appreciate it.
[06:06.480 --> 06:07.480]  It did not go unnoticed.
[06:07.480 --> 06:08.480]  Thanks a lot.
[06:08.480 --> 06:10.880]  If you guys want to make a contribution, I would definitely appreciate it.
[06:10.880 --> 06:13.080]  I'll give you a big old shout out on the show.
[06:13.080 --> 06:14.760]  I will be your Facebook friend.
[06:14.760 --> 06:15.760]  I would love it.
[06:15.760 --> 06:16.760]  All right.
[06:16.760 --> 06:18.080]  So big shout out to our buddy Seb.
[06:18.080 --> 06:19.480]  That is super awesome of you.
[06:19.480 --> 06:22.080]  I super appreciate the contribution.
[06:22.080 --> 06:24.360]  Let's see, one more thing to mention.
[06:24.360 --> 06:25.640]  Episode number 106, you guys.
[06:25.640 --> 06:30.040]  I put up episode number 106 a couple of weeks ago and Stitcher failed to grab the episode.
[06:30.040 --> 06:33.640]  It would not play on Stitcher, but since then it has been fixed.
[06:33.640 --> 06:37.840]  So if you are a Stitcher listener, you can go back and listen to episode number 106.
[06:37.840 --> 06:39.080]  It's kind of an important episode.
[06:39.080 --> 06:43.140]  If you hang out with me, if you listen to me and you feel like we're buddies since we
[06:43.140 --> 06:46.520]  become podcast friends, episode number 106 is kind of important.
[06:46.520 --> 06:48.640]  It tells you a little bit about what's going on in my world.
[06:48.640 --> 06:51.040]  I think you should listen if you have not.
[06:51.040 --> 06:53.320]  So that is available on Stitcher now.
[06:53.320 --> 06:54.320]  Let's see.
[06:54.320 --> 06:56.920]  There's a whole bunch of stuff I want to cover, you guys.
[06:56.920 --> 06:58.120]  Dude.
[06:58.120 --> 07:00.040]  So everybody knows I quit the spot dispensary.
[07:00.040 --> 07:03.360]  And if you don't, when you listen to episode number 106, you will learn that because that's
[07:03.360 --> 07:05.120]  part of what 106 is about.
[07:05.120 --> 07:07.040]  I no longer work at the spot dispensary.
[07:07.040 --> 07:09.680]  I am now part of the green and healthy wellness team.
[07:09.680 --> 07:14.360]  I am the lead cultivator for the green and healthy wellness gardens in Colorado Springs.
[07:14.360 --> 07:16.160]  Big shout out to my boy Hunt.
[07:16.160 --> 07:20.320]  He's got trust and faith in me and understands that I am able to run this large garden by
[07:20.320 --> 07:24.360]  myself and produce the quality of cannabis that they expect on their shelves.
[07:24.360 --> 07:27.840]  So much respect to the green and healthy team, much respect to Hunt.
[07:27.840 --> 07:29.160]  But let me get back to what I was saying.
[07:29.160 --> 07:30.720]  I quit the spot recently.
[07:30.720 --> 07:32.160]  I just wasn't working for me.
[07:32.160 --> 07:33.160]  It wasn't personal against the spot.
[07:33.160 --> 07:35.560]  It just wasn't, they don't have any plants yet.
[07:35.560 --> 07:36.880]  And I'm a pot grower.
[07:36.880 --> 07:39.340]  So I needed to be growing and that wasn't happening.
[07:39.340 --> 07:40.760]  So I quit.
[07:40.760 --> 07:44.280]  But the spot held a contest or maybe a raffle.
[07:44.280 --> 07:45.480]  It wasn't really a contest.
[07:45.480 --> 07:50.880]  What they did was anybody who spent over $50 in purchases got their name entered into a
[07:50.880 --> 07:55.880]  raffle to win two tickets to the Grateful Dead concert at the first bank center just
[07:55.880 --> 07:57.760]  a couple of nights ago.
[07:57.760 --> 07:58.760]  It wasn't actually the Grateful Dead.
[07:58.760 --> 08:00.440]  They called themselves Dead and Co.
[08:00.440 --> 08:03.600]  It's most of the members of the Grateful Dead, but the bass player and the lead guitar player
[08:03.600 --> 08:09.480]  and the keyboard player are new guys because, well, the guitar player is dead, you guys.
[08:09.480 --> 08:11.720]  Jerry Garcia has been dead for several years.
[08:11.720 --> 08:14.080]  So they had John Mayer, of all people, replace him.
[08:14.080 --> 08:18.000]  They had Oteel Burbridge replace the bass player because Phil Lesh is out with bladder
[08:18.000 --> 08:19.000]  cancer.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.960]  And if you know anything about the Grateful Dead, you know that they just have an issue
[08:21.960 --> 08:22.960]  with keyboard players.
[08:22.960 --> 08:25.600]  Their keyboard players seem to die for some reason.
[08:25.600 --> 08:28.760]  So this time they had Jeff Cimenti on keyboards.
[08:29.400 --> 08:35.240]  So the spot had this raffle to anybody that spent $50 could win these tickets by being
[08:35.240 --> 08:36.800]  entered into a raffle.
[08:36.800 --> 08:40.520]  Our good friend Sloppy, who has been here on the podcast, actually won the Grateful
[08:40.520 --> 08:43.480]  Dead tickets.
[08:43.480 --> 08:44.880]  Sloppy didn't put down his phone number or anything.
[08:44.880 --> 08:47.760]  He simply wrote Sloppy on the raffle ticket.
[08:47.760 --> 08:50.520]  So our good friend Mike is the manager over at the spot dispenser.
[08:50.520 --> 08:53.440]  Mike called me and he said, hey, bro, Sloppy won these Grateful Dead tickets.
[08:53.440 --> 08:54.440]  How do I get ahold of him?
[08:54.440 --> 08:57.680]  And I texted Sloppy and I said, hey, bro, you won these Grateful Dead tickets.
[08:57.680 --> 09:00.960]  And Sloppy said, cool, take those tickets and have fun, bro.
[09:00.960 --> 09:06.000]  So Sloppy, the man, my homie Sloppy, what's up, brother?
[09:06.000 --> 09:07.000]  I love you, bro.
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.060]  Sloppy threw me two free Grateful Dead tickets.
[09:11.060 --> 09:13.560]  So I got to go see the Grateful Dead on what was it?
[09:13.560 --> 09:14.560]  Was it Tuesday?
[09:14.560 --> 09:18.060]  Yeah, I get to go see this version of the Grateful Dead on Tuesday.
[09:18.060 --> 09:22.500]  And I think it's great because I quit the spot a week ago and I'm still getting perks
[09:22.500 --> 09:23.500]  and hookups from the spot.
[09:23.500 --> 09:25.720]  So shout out to the spot for the free Grateful Dead tickets.
[09:25.720 --> 09:28.660]  I had a great time and also a super huge shout out to my boy Sloppy.
[09:28.660 --> 09:30.840]  When I told him I had Grateful Dead tickets, he didn't even hesitate.
[09:30.840 --> 09:32.000]  He was like, those are yours.
[09:32.000 --> 09:33.000]  Go have fun.
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.000]  So big shout out to Sloppy.
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.000]  I love you, bro.
[09:35.000 --> 09:36.000]  Shout out to Dave.
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.580]  It was good bumping into you over at the Grateful Dead show.
[09:39.580 --> 09:42.120]  That was kind of a fun experience and also a big shout out to Rachel.
[09:42.120 --> 09:43.120]  It was good seeing you there.
[09:43.120 --> 09:46.120]  It was fun watching you blow big old vape clouds through the whole show.
[09:46.120 --> 09:48.360]  But yeah, I got to go see the Grateful Dead.
[09:48.360 --> 09:52.240]  And I think it's kind of neat that the job I quit a week ago kind of in a roundabout
[09:52.240 --> 09:54.820]  way gave me free tickets to go see the Grateful Dead.
[09:54.920 --> 09:56.920]  That was ironic in my mind.
[09:56.920 --> 10:01.140]  But the Grateful Dead, holy crap, that was such a good show.
[10:01.140 --> 10:03.340]  They're at a whole new level of playing.
[10:03.340 --> 10:05.100]  The music is refreshed.
[10:05.100 --> 10:08.380]  I said it a minute ago and you guys probably scratched your head and said, what?
[10:08.380 --> 10:10.300]  John Mayer plays for the Grateful Dead now?
[10:10.300 --> 10:12.020]  Yes, that happened.
[10:12.020 --> 10:15.780]  A few years ago, John Mayer did something stupid and I don't pay a lot of attention,
[10:15.780 --> 10:19.100]  but he said something stupid somewhere and it messed up his musical career and people
[10:19.100 --> 10:20.100]  did not like him.
[10:20.100 --> 10:23.740]  So he kind of took a little hiatus and went away for a while.
[10:23.740 --> 10:28.080]  And while he was finding himself, he discovered the Grateful Dead and discovered the Grateful
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.500]  Dead music and the way of the dead and the community and really got into it and somehow
[10:32.500 --> 10:35.540]  ended up playing guitar for the Grateful Dead now.
[10:35.540 --> 10:36.540]  And you know what?
[10:36.540 --> 10:42.460]  At first I was skeptical because John Mayer is not my style of music at all.
[10:42.460 --> 10:43.740]  That's like girl music.
[10:43.740 --> 10:45.340]  It's like teenager music in my mind.
[10:45.340 --> 10:49.540]  And yeah, I know I'm a prick because I'm really judgmental about music.
[10:49.540 --> 10:54.780]  But I got to say, when I saw John Mayer playing with the Grateful Dead, he nails it.
[10:54.780 --> 10:55.780]  He gets it perfect.
[10:55.780 --> 10:58.460]  He does everything exactly the way it should be done.
[10:58.460 --> 10:59.740]  His tone is perfect.
[10:59.740 --> 11:00.900]  He does not overplay.
[11:00.900 --> 11:03.140]  The dude knows how to play a guitar.
[11:03.140 --> 11:04.460]  He can sing you guys.
[11:04.460 --> 11:07.620]  He sang a few tunes and they sounded perfect.
[11:07.620 --> 11:08.620]  I loved it.
[11:08.620 --> 11:09.660]  Great show.
[11:09.660 --> 11:12.180]  So if you guys get a chance to go see any Grateful Dead shows, if you're a Grateful
[11:12.180 --> 11:15.900]  Dead fan, I definitely recommend you go check it out.
[11:15.900 --> 11:16.900]  Get there early.
[11:16.900 --> 11:17.900]  Have a good time.
[11:17.900 --> 11:18.900]  Enjoy the lot scene.
[11:19.460 --> 11:20.460]  My buddy Gibbs.
[11:20.460 --> 11:22.620]  I took Gibbs with me to the Grateful Dead show and we had a great time.
[11:22.620 --> 11:23.980]  Haven't seen Gibbs in quite a while.
[11:23.980 --> 11:27.740]  So it was a wonderful time hanging out with my brother Gibbs at the Grateful Dead show.
[11:27.740 --> 11:29.660]  Shout out to the entire Deadhead family.
[11:29.660 --> 11:31.100]  I'm going to keep moving on with the podcast.
[11:31.100 --> 11:32.900]  I feel like I'm really rambly today.
[11:32.900 --> 11:35.300]  So I hope you guys are into that.
[11:35.300 --> 11:38.060]  I've got an event coming up next weekend.
[11:38.060 --> 11:41.460]  It's the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational.
[11:41.460 --> 11:46.140]  Everybody knows that I bred this strain of weed for the lovely Miss Dude It's Damsel.
[11:46.140 --> 11:48.740]  If you guys aren't following Dude It's Damsel on Instagram, you're missing out.
[11:49.580 --> 11:51.380]  So make sure you go follow my friend Dude It's Damsel.
[11:51.380 --> 11:53.300]  She's the manager at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[11:53.300 --> 11:57.420]  She's an alternative model and her Instagram pictures will put a smile on your face.
[11:57.420 --> 12:02.060]  But I did breed a strain of cannabis for our friend Damsel and we are having an official
[12:02.060 --> 12:07.540]  tasting party at the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational on the 4th and 5th of next month.
[12:07.540 --> 12:13.180]  So I will record, I will do my best to record with Damsel and get a little bit of that onto
[12:13.180 --> 12:14.180]  the show.
[12:14.180 --> 12:18.460]  But what we're going to do is Damsel's bringing a few of her friends from out of town.
[12:19.180 --> 12:21.060]  Myself and a couple other dudes will be at the event.
[12:21.060 --> 12:23.140]  We've rented a house in Manitou Springs.
[12:23.140 --> 12:24.140]  It's a private party.
[12:24.140 --> 12:27.660]  But we've rented a house and we're going to have a tasting party.
[12:27.660 --> 12:29.700]  I have got 10 jars in front of me.
[12:29.700 --> 12:31.580]  I'm going to crack one open right now just for fun.
[12:31.580 --> 12:35.060]  I got 10 jars of herb that I grew for the lovely Damsel.
[12:35.060 --> 12:36.740]  Oh, it smells so good.
[12:36.740 --> 12:40.860]  And we're going to have a little tasting party and Miss Damsel is going to decide which of
[12:40.860 --> 12:46.980]  these phenotypes gets to be the selection that will take the name of Damsel's Dank.
[12:46.980 --> 12:51.940]  And then we will get a clone into the shop and we will start growing Damsel's Dank at
[12:51.940 --> 12:55.100]  Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado Springs.
[12:55.100 --> 12:57.220]  And it will be available on the shelves.
[12:57.220 --> 13:00.980]  It'll be a little while, but we'll get it there and the whole world with a medical card
[13:00.980 --> 13:02.420]  will be able to try it.
[13:02.420 --> 13:06.380]  Hopefully, eventually Colorado Springs will wake up and start allowing recreational cannabis
[13:06.380 --> 13:11.020]  sales and that way we can make Damsel's Dank available to the entire world.
[13:11.020 --> 13:12.020]  That would be awesome.
[13:12.020 --> 13:16.460]  Big shout out to Hunt for putting me in touch with Damsel and also a huge shout out to the
[13:16.460 --> 13:18.180]  lovely dude at Damsel.
[13:18.180 --> 13:23.260]  Hey, Britt, thanks for giving me the honor of being the breeder chosen to create a strain
[13:23.260 --> 13:24.260]  for you.
[13:24.260 --> 13:27.460]  I understand how important this is to you and I'm going to get it right for you.
[13:27.460 --> 13:28.460]  Trust me.
[13:28.460 --> 13:29.460]  All right.
[13:29.460 --> 13:31.820]  So the next thing I want to do is a little grow lesson.
[13:31.820 --> 13:34.020]  This will be a very simple lesson.
[13:34.020 --> 13:38.900]  I was watching a Facebook argument the other day and people were arguing over a plant being
[13:38.900 --> 13:40.860]  male or female.
[13:40.860 --> 13:44.220]  And I thought I'd just come on here and just make it really clear and simple.
[13:44.220 --> 13:47.020]  And we'll talk about what a male and a female plant look like.
[13:47.020 --> 13:51.340]  Okay, when it comes time to determine the sex of your plants, there are a few ways you
[13:51.340 --> 13:53.060]  can go about doing it.
[13:53.060 --> 13:56.300]  The main way that you can do it is to just flower your plant.
[13:56.300 --> 14:01.020]  If you've got a plant and you put it under 1212, which is 12 hours on and 12 hours off
[14:01.020 --> 14:05.980]  of light and you need full darkness in your dark cycle, you guys, you need complete darkness
[14:05.980 --> 14:08.220]  uninterrupted for 12 full hours.
[14:08.220 --> 14:11.380]  If you can see anything in that room in the dark cycle, it is too bright.
[14:11.380 --> 14:13.820]  You need to make it darker.
[14:14.300 --> 14:16.260]  If there's any light, it's not dark enough.
[14:16.260 --> 14:17.480]  That is not considered dark.
[14:17.480 --> 14:21.540]  If you can see your hand in front of your face, it is too light in there.
[14:21.540 --> 14:26.260]  The only lights that you can have in a grow room during the dark cycle are green LED lights
[14:26.260 --> 14:28.860]  or those green coiled fluorescent lights.
[14:28.860 --> 14:29.860]  Those will work for you.
[14:29.860 --> 14:31.940]  You need green light in your dark cycle.
[14:31.940 --> 14:35.780]  Green lighting during the flowering cycle does not interrupt the flowering photo period
[14:35.780 --> 14:39.380]  because the plants are green and they do not absorb green light.
[14:39.420 --> 14:45.380]  By putting any plant into the 1212 period, you will actually induce the flowering stage.
[14:45.380 --> 14:51.580]  In about 10 to 14 days-ish, you'll be able to tell if your plant is male or female by
[14:51.580 --> 14:52.900]  signs that it shows.
[14:52.900 --> 14:55.540]  We'll talk about those here in just a couple of seconds.
[14:55.540 --> 14:57.780]  You can flower a plant at any size.
[14:57.780 --> 14:59.860]  It doesn't matter how big it is.
[14:59.860 --> 15:02.940]  What's going to happen is it's going to flower when you put it into 1212.
[15:02.940 --> 15:04.660]  That's what's going to make it flower.
[15:04.660 --> 15:09.340]  What I always recommend is that you take a clone from every seed that you grow.
[15:09.340 --> 15:12.860]  When you start a plant from seed, please take a clone from it.
[15:12.860 --> 15:13.980]  You never know.
[15:13.980 --> 15:17.500]  You might be growing the most amazing strain anybody has ever smoked.
[15:17.500 --> 15:22.700]  It may be the perfect medicinal strain for everybody on the planet, for the entire population.
[15:22.700 --> 15:23.900]  It could cure every ailment.
[15:23.900 --> 15:25.280]  You never know.
[15:25.280 --> 15:30.060]  If you didn't take a clone, you're going to be so mad at yourself about that.
[15:30.060 --> 15:31.940]  There's one strain that I grew that got away.
[15:31.940 --> 15:33.300]  I could not get it to clone.
[15:33.300 --> 15:35.180]  It was some of the best cannabis I've ever smoked.
[15:35.180 --> 15:38.940]  I'm a little mad at myself that I couldn't get it to clone, but I do have more seeds
[15:38.940 --> 15:39.940]  of it.
[15:39.940 --> 15:43.460]  Hopefully, I can find that phenotype again.
[15:43.460 --> 15:47.100]  Grow a plant from seed, and then put it under 1212, and it will flower.
[15:47.100 --> 15:48.900]  I always recommend taking a clone.
[15:48.900 --> 15:49.900]  Take a clone.
[15:49.900 --> 15:53.560]  Now, you've got a plant that has grown for a little while, and you've got a clone.
[15:53.560 --> 15:57.540]  You can either flower out that original plant that has been growing.
[15:57.540 --> 16:00.860]  That way, you've got a little bit of product to show for yourself, and you've got something
[16:00.860 --> 16:05.940]  to smoke and make it worth your time, or you can flower out that clone.
[16:05.940 --> 16:09.580]  As soon as that clone that you took starts showing roots, you can switch that light to
[16:09.580 --> 16:12.180]  1212, and that clone will flower.
[16:12.180 --> 16:17.860]  In 10 to 14 days, you'll have a little tiny plant with either male or female flowers coming
[16:17.860 --> 16:18.860]  out of it.
[16:18.860 --> 16:20.740]  You'll be able to tell if you've got a boy or a girl.
[16:20.740 --> 16:24.980]  At that point, you can either throw away that male plant that you've got that's in the bigger
[16:24.980 --> 16:30.380]  pot, or you can put that female plant into the flowering room and start making buds out
[16:30.380 --> 16:34.300]  of it, or keep it as a mother plant and keep taking clones off of it and have that strain
[16:34.300 --> 16:36.760]  around forever.
[16:36.760 --> 16:40.900]  Take clones, you guys, and then you can either clone that original clone or flower that original
[16:40.900 --> 16:45.140]  clone as it roots out, and then you can see what you've got, or you can flower that original
[16:45.140 --> 16:46.140]  plant.
[16:46.140 --> 16:49.980]  Either way, it's going to do the same thing, and you will know what you've got.
[16:49.980 --> 16:50.980]  Please take a clone.
[16:50.980 --> 16:52.180]  I can't stress that.
[16:52.180 --> 16:56.920]  Also, you guys, the plants will show sex if you let them pre-flower.
[16:56.920 --> 17:00.100]  If you leave a plant in a pot for long enough to where it feels like it's starting to get
[17:00.100 --> 17:05.420]  root-bound and it's reached its space, its space constraints in that pot, it will actually
[17:05.420 --> 17:06.980]  start to flower on its own.
[17:06.980 --> 17:10.780]  Some genetics will just panic and start to flower on their own that way, and they will
[17:10.780 --> 17:13.280]  show you what is called a pre-flower.
[17:13.280 --> 17:17.060]  That's just the plant showing you that it's reaching maturity, that it is ready to go,
[17:17.060 --> 17:21.180]  that its hormones are built up, that it wants you to switch the flowering cycle.
[17:21.180 --> 17:24.260]  Simply waiting for the plant to pre-flower is a good way to determine if you've got a
[17:24.260 --> 17:28.500]  male or a female, but then you do waste a lot of light and a lot of nutrients and a
[17:28.500 --> 17:29.500]  lot of space.
[17:29.900 --> 17:32.220]  If you're a productive gardener, sometimes you just can't deal with that.
[17:32.220 --> 17:35.580]  That's why I recommend cutting a clone and flowering out that little clone and seeing
[17:35.580 --> 17:36.580]  what you've got.
[17:36.580 --> 17:40.900]  It's a lot easier to waste a little bit of time under a fluorescent light than it is
[17:40.900 --> 17:44.780]  to waste time under that big 1,000-watt high-pressure sodium lamp where you could have been running
[17:44.780 --> 17:46.480]  a useful crop.
[17:46.480 --> 17:49.980]  Take some clones, flower them out, see what you're working with.
[17:49.980 --> 17:54.540]  Now it feels like it's time to talk about what to look for when your plants do start
[17:54.540 --> 17:57.700]  flowering so that you can tell if you've got boys or girls.
[17:57.700 --> 18:02.460]  I'm going to call it an intersection, but at a node where the two nodes separate, you've
[18:02.460 --> 18:05.300]  got your main stock coming up, and then you've got the little intersection where a branch
[18:05.300 --> 18:08.640]  comes off to the left and a branch comes off to the right.
[18:08.640 --> 18:12.740]  Right about there, your plants are either going to grow balls or hairs.
[18:12.740 --> 18:16.940]  I know that sounds really general, but that's the most simple way to describe this.
[18:16.940 --> 18:21.460]  You're either going to get a pair of balls growing out right there at that intersection,
[18:21.460 --> 18:24.260]  or you are going to get little hairs.
[18:24.260 --> 18:28.020]  If you see two little hairs sticking up, those are your female plant parts.
[18:28.020 --> 18:32.220]  Those are actually the parts that if you were to spread pollen in the room, the pollen would
[18:32.220 --> 18:34.180]  land on those little pistils.
[18:34.180 --> 18:35.540]  Those are called pistils.
[18:35.540 --> 18:39.700]  Those pistils would slide the pollen up into the ovule, which would absorb the pollen,
[18:39.700 --> 18:45.500]  which would then pollinate your plant, and then it would produce seeds.
[18:45.500 --> 18:47.800]  If you've got those little hairs, you have got girls.
[18:47.800 --> 18:50.540]  If you've got those balls, you've got male plants.
[18:50.540 --> 18:54.740]  Unless you plan on making some seeds and doing some breeding, it is time to get those
[18:54.740 --> 18:56.420]  boy plants out of the room.
[18:56.420 --> 18:59.580]  Honestly, if you're listening to this lesson and you're learning about how to determine
[18:59.580 --> 19:02.140]  sex, please do not breed cannabis yet.
[19:02.140 --> 19:04.500]  Please learn a lot more about plants before you breed.
[19:04.500 --> 19:05.500]  I'll touch on that in a minute.
[19:05.500 --> 19:08.020]  I'll try to remember to mention why.
[19:08.020 --> 19:10.140]  If you see balls, get those plants out of there.
[19:10.140 --> 19:11.540]  Also, here's a good hint.
[19:11.540 --> 19:13.300]  The male plants ... I'm a breeder.
[19:13.300 --> 19:14.660]  I've been breeding plants for a long time.
[19:14.660 --> 19:17.060]  I've been growing plants for a really long time.
[19:17.060 --> 19:21.580]  One thing I really notice is the male plants grow much, much taller.
[19:21.580 --> 19:25.060]  If you've got a plant that's just taken off, it's just getting really, really tall, it's
[19:25.060 --> 19:28.660]  got a real thick, fibrous stalk, that's probably a boy.
[19:28.660 --> 19:29.940]  I would just count on that.
[19:29.940 --> 19:33.540]  Don't get so excited that you've got this one plant that grows like a son of a bitch.
[19:33.540 --> 19:35.580]  It is probably a son of that bitch.
[19:35.580 --> 19:36.580]  It's probably a boy.
[19:36.580 --> 19:38.100]  You're going to want to get rid of that in the future.
[19:38.100 --> 19:40.180]  As soon as you flower it, you will know.
[19:40.180 --> 19:42.900]  Pull the males as soon as you can, you guys.
[19:42.900 --> 19:49.380]  If you've got male and female plants flowering next to each other, by day 14, that male plant
[19:49.380 --> 19:50.740]  is getting ready to drop pollen.
[19:50.740 --> 19:54.380]  I've seen them drop pollen around two weeks into flower.
[19:54.380 --> 19:58.580]  The second to third week, that male plant is really going to start spitting out his
[19:58.580 --> 19:59.800]  pollen.
[19:59.800 --> 20:03.260]  Your female plants are going to be just ready to take pollen at that time, so you're going
[20:03.260 --> 20:07.160]  to end up with a seeded crop if you don't pay attention and get those boys out of there.
[20:07.160 --> 20:11.380]  If you leave those boys in too long, they'll seed up the entire room very quickly.
[20:11.500 --> 20:16.140]  It just takes one quick little pass of the fan to spread that pollen through the whole
[20:16.140 --> 20:18.500]  room and then you've got a pollinated crop.
[20:18.500 --> 20:20.260]  You've got seeds everywhere.
[20:20.260 --> 20:21.260]  Pay attention.
[20:21.260 --> 20:22.460]  Check every single day.
[20:22.460 --> 20:23.800]  Get the males out of there.
[20:23.800 --> 20:25.340]  Be diligent about it.
[20:25.340 --> 20:26.340]  Don't relax.
[20:26.340 --> 20:28.420]  Stay on top of that shit and get those out of there.
[20:28.420 --> 20:29.420]  All right.
[20:29.420 --> 20:33.020]  It feels like I've talked enough about male plants and how to identify them.
[20:33.020 --> 20:37.800]  Let's talk a little bit about hermaphrodites because hermaphrodites can really confuse
[20:37.800 --> 20:39.460]  a new grower.
[20:39.460 --> 20:41.900]  Hermaphrodites can confuse an experienced grower.
[20:41.900 --> 20:44.500]  A hermaphrodite is, and there are a lot of words for it.
[20:44.500 --> 20:47.220]  You'll hear people call it a hermie or a herm.
[20:47.220 --> 20:48.220]  It's a hermaphrodite, you guys.
[20:48.220 --> 20:54.940]  It is a plant that has both male and female sexes and it will show them hopefully very
[20:54.940 --> 20:55.940]  early in flower.
[20:55.940 --> 21:00.180]  Unfortunately, sometimes you don't see it until like week eight on a nine-week plant
[21:00.180 --> 21:03.060]  and then it starts showing a little pollen sack and then you're like, oh shit, I got
[21:03.060 --> 21:05.180]  to cut this plant or I got to pick this pollen sack out.
[21:05.180 --> 21:07.460]  You start panicking.
[21:07.460 --> 21:08.600]  Let's talk about hermaphrodites.
[21:08.740 --> 21:14.240]  When you see a plant with male and female parts coming out of it during flower, you've
[21:14.240 --> 21:18.200]  probably got yourself a hermaphrodite.
[21:18.200 --> 21:22.860]  Oftentimes this happens in regular breeding and it often happens in feminized seeds.
[21:22.860 --> 21:24.800]  This is something that just happens.
[21:24.800 --> 21:27.560]  I breed regular and feminized seeds.
[21:27.560 --> 21:31.160]  A lot of people try to hate on feminized seeds for hermaphrodism.
[21:31.160 --> 21:34.960]  If feminized seeds are made correctly, they will not be hermaphrodites, you guys.
[21:34.960 --> 21:37.260]  They will be good seeds.
[21:37.260 --> 21:42.940]  I've gotten more hermaphrodites from regular seeds than I have from feminized seeds.
[21:42.940 --> 21:46.620]  I'm a breeder and I run a lot of seeds.
[21:46.620 --> 21:48.900]  I don't blame it on the feminized seeds at all.
[21:48.900 --> 21:51.500]  I think it is just something that happens.
[21:51.500 --> 21:54.980]  You get males, you get females, and you get hermaphrodites.
[21:54.980 --> 21:58.600]  The whole goal of this plant, its whole goal is to reproduce itself.
[21:58.600 --> 22:00.460]  That's what it wants to do.
[22:00.460 --> 22:01.460]  It's a horny plant.
[22:01.460 --> 22:02.460]  It's a horny male.
[22:02.460 --> 22:03.460]  It's a horny girl.
[22:03.460 --> 22:04.620]  They just want to find another plant.
[22:04.620 --> 22:08.300]  They want to make seeds so that the seeds can drop into the ground and those seeds can
[22:08.300 --> 22:09.820]  happen again next year.
[22:09.820 --> 22:12.900]  This whole plant's goal is to just reproduce.
[22:12.900 --> 22:16.060]  Sometimes it will do whatever it's got to reproduce.
[22:16.060 --> 22:20.020]  One of its fail-safe backup plans is to become a hermaphrodite.
[22:20.020 --> 22:21.020]  Sometimes that happens.
[22:21.020 --> 22:23.940]  Now, I've said that that can be a trait that is just in the plant.
[22:23.940 --> 22:27.140]  That can be in the DNA of that plant.
[22:27.140 --> 22:31.140]  That plant can be born as a hermaphrodite.
[22:31.140 --> 22:36.100]  Sometimes hermaphrodites are caused by environment or mistakes.
[22:36.100 --> 22:41.100]  If you interrupt the dark cycle during the flowering period, I talked earlier about how
[22:41.100 --> 22:46.020]  you have to have that complete 12-12 photo period with 12 hours of complete uninterrupted
[22:46.020 --> 22:47.460]  darkness.
[22:47.460 --> 22:52.820]  If you interrupt that, you will cause your plants to hermaphrodite.
[22:52.820 --> 22:58.260]  If you open up that door and left that light on for six hours during one dark cycle, you
[22:58.260 --> 23:01.460]  will start to see male flowers pop up in your female flowers.
[23:01.460 --> 23:05.300]  You'll see it happen and you will have a seeded plant.
[23:05.300 --> 23:06.580]  It happens like that.
[23:06.580 --> 23:09.820]  That is the kind of thing that can cause hermaphrodism.
[23:09.820 --> 23:14.100]  A lot of the chem dog and cush strains, if you push them too hard with nutrients or just
[23:14.100 --> 23:17.980]  give them a little bit of stress somehow, if they get bugs or powdery mildew, they'll
[23:17.980 --> 23:21.100]  hermaphrodite on you just in a survival method.
[23:21.100 --> 23:25.060]  That is something that that plant wants to do just to make sure that it gets to carry
[23:25.060 --> 23:26.140]  on with its race.
[23:26.140 --> 23:29.220]  It just wants to keep going on with its life.
[23:29.220 --> 23:30.940]  Hermaphrodites can be really confusing.
[23:30.940 --> 23:33.060]  Shit does happen like that in the grow room.
[23:33.060 --> 23:38.020]  That's your job as a grower to be aware of it and to learn how to identify it.
[23:38.020 --> 23:43.580]  If you see pollen sacks and pistils on the same plant, you've probably got a hermaphrodite.
[23:43.580 --> 23:44.720]  It is not worth keeping.
[23:44.720 --> 23:46.300]  You need to get rid of that plant.
[23:46.300 --> 23:50.300]  No matter how good it looks, no matter how sweet it smells, that plant needs to go.
[23:50.300 --> 23:54.260]  Now, if your plant is well into the flowering cycle and you've got big old chunky buds and
[23:54.260 --> 23:58.180]  you're starting to see these pollen sacks come up, these little male flowers, they look
[23:58.180 --> 23:59.180]  like little bananas.
[23:59.180 --> 24:03.300]  You guys, it just looks like maybe a piece of rice or just it's a little tiny, tiny micro
[24:03.300 --> 24:05.240]  sized banana popping up out of your plants.
[24:05.240 --> 24:06.420]  That's a little male pollen sack.
[24:06.420 --> 24:09.500]  This little male flower coming out of your female plants.
[24:09.500 --> 24:14.620]  Oftentimes that stuff will happen late in flower somewhere between week seven and nine.
[24:14.620 --> 24:18.820]  If you're past week seven or past, yeah, I'd say past week seven and you see those, you've
[24:18.820 --> 24:20.940]  got a decision to make anytime before week seven.
[24:20.940 --> 24:23.540]  You guys, if I see that shit, that plant is dead.
[24:23.540 --> 24:24.580]  I just murder it.
[24:24.580 --> 24:26.260]  I've got availability to more plants.
[24:26.260 --> 24:28.820]  I've got access to seeds and clones like you wouldn't believe.
[24:28.820 --> 24:30.100]  So I'm a little picky.
[24:30.100 --> 24:32.380]  I'm not afraid to euthanize a plant.
[24:32.380 --> 24:33.380]  Sometimes shit just has to go.
[24:33.380 --> 24:38.420]  If it doesn't work for my grow room, sometimes a certain plant and your environment, that's
[24:38.420 --> 24:40.340]  called a phenotypical expression.
[24:40.340 --> 24:44.020]  The plant will express that it is not happy with your environment and it won't work for
[24:44.020 --> 24:47.280]  you and you just got to get rid of that plant and grow a different plant.
[24:47.280 --> 24:51.500]  But if you start seeing those bananas popping up around week six or seven or eight, you
[24:51.500 --> 24:52.660]  have a decision to make.
[24:52.780 --> 24:55.820]  If they're popping up around week nine, it's not that bad because you've only got a few
[24:55.820 --> 24:56.820]  days left.
[24:56.820 --> 24:58.940]  Most plants are going to go about nine, maybe 10 weeks.
[24:58.940 --> 25:03.140]  If you've got a plant that you're ending up week seven and you start seeing little nanners
[25:03.140 --> 25:06.820]  popping up, you want to figure out if you want to keep that plant going.
[25:06.820 --> 25:10.520]  Is it worth risking the rest of the garden?
[25:10.520 --> 25:13.740]  Sometimes those little bananas are sterile and they don't produce pollen.
[25:13.740 --> 25:18.220]  Sometimes one of those can rupture and it will pollinate the plant that that banana
[25:18.220 --> 25:23.620]  is on and it will pollinate the plants all around that plant as well.
[25:23.620 --> 25:24.780]  Sometimes it can pollinate the whole room.
[25:24.780 --> 25:28.740]  You guys, it doesn't take much pollen to create seeds and so now you'll have seeds in all
[25:28.740 --> 25:29.740]  of your plants.
[25:29.740 --> 25:30.740]  So you've got a decision to make.
[25:30.740 --> 25:34.220]  Do you want to try to eliminate the plant?
[25:34.220 --> 25:38.500]  Do you want to risk it or do you want to try to get rid of those bananas?
[25:38.500 --> 25:44.260]  What you can do to those little male flowers, you can mist them with water because water
[25:44.260 --> 25:45.500]  deactivates pollen.
[25:45.500 --> 25:49.660]  So just mist the plant with water and then get some tweezers and pluck out those little
[25:49.660 --> 25:50.660]  nanners.
[25:50.660 --> 25:54.420]  If you're around week eight, week nine, just pluck those out if you want to.
[25:54.420 --> 25:57.540]  If you're in week nine, just leave it there and don't touch it until you harvest and you
[25:57.540 --> 25:59.500]  should be just fine.
[25:59.500 --> 26:02.340]  If it's popping up at week nine, it's probably sterile.
[26:02.340 --> 26:06.420]  But sometimes it's scary and you don't want to risk it around week seven or week eight.
[26:06.420 --> 26:07.820]  You might want to pluck them out.
[26:07.820 --> 26:08.820]  It's up to you.
[26:08.820 --> 26:09.900]  That's when you have a decision to make.
[26:09.900 --> 26:14.860]  But if you're a breeder, do not ever breed with a plant that'll make a hermaphrodite,
[26:15.300 --> 26:19.140]  a little pop up, a little male plant around week seven, eight or nine.
[26:19.140 --> 26:23.700]  Don't do that because then you're going to breed that hermaphroditic trait into something.
[26:23.700 --> 26:25.860]  So make sure you pull out the hermaphrodites.
[26:25.860 --> 26:27.780]  Keep an eye on that.
[26:27.780 --> 26:29.140]  That's a decision you're going to have to make.
[26:29.140 --> 26:31.540]  That's going to happen at some point in your grow career.
[26:31.540 --> 26:36.020]  You're going to see a female plant popping up a male flower at week eight and you're
[26:36.020 --> 26:37.020]  going to panic.
[26:37.020 --> 26:39.260]  But don't worry, it's not the end of the world.
[26:39.260 --> 26:44.140]  You can either pluck out that male, you can let it grow or you can just destroy the plant.
[26:44.140 --> 26:45.140]  It's up to you.
[26:45.140 --> 26:47.820]  You can always turn those seeded plants into really good hash.
[26:47.820 --> 26:53.700]  I think plants that are allowed to seed make better hash than plants without seeds.
[26:53.700 --> 26:58.460]  You don't get as much hash sometimes, but I think that the high is better once you allow
[26:58.460 --> 26:59.740]  the plants to make seeds.
[26:59.740 --> 27:03.740]  And I only know that because I breed and sometimes when I breed there's material left over.
[27:03.740 --> 27:05.660]  Well, most of the time when I breed there's material left over.
[27:05.660 --> 27:10.420]  You have to separate the seeds from the actual bud and we will run the bud material and turn
[27:10.420 --> 27:12.080]  it into BHO.
[27:12.200 --> 27:14.840]  I like the seeded BHO.
[27:14.840 --> 27:17.920]  There's no seeds in the BHO, but I mean it comes from seeded materials.
[27:17.920 --> 27:20.320]  Seeds are removed, then we run the material.
[27:20.320 --> 27:24.760]  The seeds are packaged and grown and then the material is turned into hash and that
[27:24.760 --> 27:28.600]  hash seems to get me a little bit better of a buzz.
[27:28.600 --> 27:29.600]  That's my opinion.
[27:29.600 --> 27:38.080]  I talked earlier about new growers not breeding and hermaphrodites are a little bit of why.
[27:38.080 --> 27:42.960]  Let me touch on why I said please don't breed if you're a new grower.
[27:42.960 --> 27:45.200]  Breeding takes a very selective eye.
[27:45.200 --> 27:48.040]  You need to understand what plants you're putting together.
[27:48.040 --> 27:52.000]  If you're putting a plant, a plant needs to be properly tested before it's bred.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.800]  I have talked about how I stress test a plant before I'll breed with it.
[27:54.800 --> 27:59.560]  I'll take a girl plant and I will try to piss that plant off the best I can and see what
[27:59.560 --> 28:04.880]  it takes to make that plant hermaphrodite or die or stress or whatever.
[28:04.880 --> 28:09.520]  I make sure it's not going to herm on me and more importantly, I make sure that the
[28:09.520 --> 28:13.720]  progeny, the offspring, the seeds that come from that female plant, I make sure that they're
[28:13.720 --> 28:16.720]  not going to hermaphrodite on you.
[28:16.720 --> 28:21.720]  You have to have a plant, you have to stress the shit out of it, you have to have a properly
[28:21.720 --> 28:23.400]  selected male.
[28:23.400 --> 28:25.680]  The eye for male selection is a skill.
[28:25.680 --> 28:29.560]  I plan to have a conversation with other breeders on this show about male selection, so we'll
[28:29.560 --> 28:32.240]  give you a heads up on that.
[28:32.240 --> 28:34.860]  Selecting a male is definitely a special skill.
[28:34.860 --> 28:38.620]  Selecting plants for breeding is a skill, it's an art.
[28:38.620 --> 28:42.540]  If you're not experienced with the plants you're using, you may breed some bullshit
[28:42.540 --> 28:45.700]  and then you're going to have a bunch of seeds and you're going to give those seeds out and
[28:45.700 --> 28:49.500]  you're going to grow those bullshit seeds.
[28:49.500 --> 28:54.660]  The whole idea of breeding cannabis is to improve the genetics, to improve the race,
[28:54.660 --> 28:56.320]  to make the plant better.
[28:56.320 --> 28:59.460]  If you're breeding bullshit into it, you're just watering it down and you're spreading
[28:59.460 --> 29:04.020]  genetics that are a waste of time, that are a waste of people's garden space when they
[29:04.020 --> 29:08.340]  could have been growing some usable medicine that would have worked for them.
[29:08.340 --> 29:11.860]  I'm not dissing any new growers, I'm just asking you, please don't try to breed until
[29:11.860 --> 29:14.220]  you're a little more familiar with the plant.
[29:14.220 --> 29:18.260]  If you have to listen to a podcast and learn how to sex your plant, then you're not ready
[29:18.260 --> 29:21.380]  to breed and I'm just being honest with you.
[29:21.380 --> 29:24.820]  Learn slowly and then when you're ready to breed, I'll be here to help you out.
[29:24.820 --> 29:27.900]  I'm not trying to get rid of you, I'm just trying to be honest with you.
[29:27.900 --> 29:28.900]  That's the truth.
[29:28.900 --> 29:31.100]  Learn how to grow and then we'll learn how to breed.
[29:31.100 --> 29:33.540]  You got to learn to ride the bike before you can do wheelies, brah.
[29:33.540 --> 29:36.260]  All right, it feels like I've been going on for about 30 minutes.
[29:36.260 --> 29:37.260]  Let's see.
[29:37.260 --> 29:38.260]  Look at that, you guys.
[29:38.260 --> 29:39.740]  I went 29 minutes and I didn't even make any notes.
[29:39.740 --> 29:40.740]  I didn't look at the clock.
[29:40.740 --> 29:41.740]  That was a great episode.
[29:41.740 --> 29:42.980]  I feel like I did a good job.
[29:42.980 --> 29:48.420]  I hope you guys enjoyed listening to that little lesson on how to sex your ganja plants.
[29:48.420 --> 29:50.220]  I want to start wrapping up the show.
[29:50.220 --> 29:54.340]  You guys, make sure that you check out my favorite glass company, Hitman Glass.

[29:55.580 --> 29:56.580]  Go to hitmanglass.com.
[29:56.580 --> 30:00.260]  Make sure you support Hitman Glass Dougie on Instagram.
[30:00.420 --> 30:02.500]  Make sure you support all the HitFam.
[30:02.500 --> 30:05.060]  There are a ton of Hitman Glass makers.
[30:05.060 --> 30:08.260]  You can follow them all on Instagram if you'd like to.
[30:08.260 --> 30:10.540]  Check them out, see what they're doing in the shop.
[30:10.540 --> 30:12.380]  You guys, Hitman's got it going on.
[30:12.380 --> 30:14.340]  They've got Hitman Farms.
[30:14.340 --> 30:18.300]  They're producing their own line of concentrates in California.

[30:20.300 --> 30:22.300]  They've got nails.
[30:22.300 --> 30:27.460]  It sounds like they're now doing sales and distribution of fine smoking accessories.

[31:07.080 --> 31:08.080]  All right.
[31:08.080 --> 31:09.080]  It's time to wrap up the podcast, you guys.
[31:09.080 --> 31:10.760]  I want to thank everybody for listening.

[31:44.920 --> 31:45.920]  We are on Twitter.
[31:45.920 --> 31:48.240]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[31:48.240 --> 31:49.440]  I am back on Instagram.
[31:49.440 --> 31:52.960]  I mentioned earlier that they deleted the iRegenetics account from Instagram.
[31:52.960 --> 31:53.960]  I am back.
[31:53.960 --> 31:55.800]  It's iRee underscore genetics.

[32:06.840 --> 32:12.360]  is always and forever archived on iReegeneticscolorado.com.
[32:12.360 --> 32:16.240]  Since they took down the Instagram, it's got me paranoid that things can disappear from
[32:16.240 --> 32:17.320]  the internet.
[32:17.320 --> 32:22.680]  So if there's ever a time that I'm not on your whatever service you're listening to,
[32:22.680 --> 32:26.400]  if you've got me on Stitcher, if you've got me on iTunes, if I ever disappear from there,

[32:30.560 --> 32:31.560]  That is my website.
[32:31.560 --> 32:32.800]  They cannot take that away from me.
[32:32.800 --> 32:34.860]  Babylon cannot control what I put there.
[32:34.860 --> 32:37.600]  So this show will always be there.

[33:22.640 --> 33:23.640]  mom a hug for me.
[33:23.640 --> 33:24.640]  If you are in these shoes, I bet you do the same just like you do.
[33:24.640 --> 35:35.490]  Plant a nickel, earth just strengthens the food.
[35:35.490 --> 35:36.490]  Nothing wrong with what the farmer do.
[35:36.490 --> 35:37.490]  What would you do if you were in these shoes?
[35:37.490 --> 35:38.490]  Oh yeah.

[35:40.490 --> 35:41.490]  I'm your host, Sean O'Reilly.
[35:41.490 --> 35:42.490]  I'm here with my buddy, Sean.
[35:42.490 --> 35:43.490]  He's a great guy.
[35:43.490 --> 35:44.490]  He's a great guy.

[37:26.820 --> 37:31.420]  It's time for episode number 109 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[37:31.420 --> 37:32.740]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[37:32.740 --> 37:33.740]  That's right.
[37:33.740 --> 37:39.540]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[37:39.540 --> 37:43.620]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[37:43.620 --> 37:47.460]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[37:47.460 --> 37:49.300]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[37:49.300 --> 37:50.600]  I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[37:50.600 --> 37:54.720]  joining me. As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[37:54.720 --> 37:58.720]  Roots band. Thanks for letting me use your music on my show. Big thanks to Kat, Coop,
[37:58.720 --> 38:03.960]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew. I hope everybody's having a great afternoon, morning, evening,
[38:03.960 --> 38:06.720]  whatever it is, wherever you are. Hope you got something rolled up. Hope you got a fat
[38:06.720 --> 38:10.560]  dab. Hope you got a vaporizer. Hope you got an edible in you. Hope you got something good
[38:10.560 --> 38:14.280]  going on. Hope you're getting turped out in some way, shape, or form. Hey guys, this is
[38:14.280 --> 38:18.520]  another episode that comes from the car, but this is a sort of a part two. Recently, I
[38:18.520 --> 38:23.840]  did an episode about ways to improve your garden. Well, this is a part two of that episode.
[38:23.840 --> 38:28.880]  More ways on how to improve your garden. I also include a little rant toward the end.
[38:28.880 --> 38:32.840]  I did have to stop recording halfway through because I arrived at my destination, but I
[38:32.840 --> 38:36.560]  did start recording on the way home. So there's a little cut in the middle, but I hope you
[38:36.560 --> 38:40.600]  enjoy that. Before I go too far, this podcast is brought to you by my good friends at Hitman
[38:40.600 --> 38:45.000]  Glass. Big shout out to the crew at Hitman Glass. Make sure you support Hitman Dougie
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.280]  and the entire Hitman Glass crew. Hitman Glass is made in America by Americans. Today
[38:50.280 --> 38:55.560]  we're hitting the Hitman and Samson collab. This is one of my favorite rigs in my collection.
[38:55.560 --> 39:01.160]  It's got like a, I'd say a six inch tall can with a straight up, I don't know the piece
[39:01.160 --> 39:04.760]  where the ball or the, the nail attaches go straight up. It's got a mouthpiece that comes
[39:04.760 --> 39:09.760]  out of the side. It's got a beautiful green worked base, maybe a turquoise color in there.
[39:09.760 --> 39:15.240]  It's got a green Hitman logo here on the side. It's got a green Hitman flame across
[39:15.240 --> 39:21.120]  the mouthpiece there. I'm going to do myself a fat favor and we're going to take a dab
[39:21.120 --> 39:25.400]  and then we are going to get into the part of the podcast where I am in the car. So I'm
[39:25.400 --> 39:29.360]  gonna start heating up this nail. I'm gonna let the music fade in and then I will be in
[39:29.360 --> 39:32.480]  the car the next time you hear my voice. So I'm gonna take a dab. Big shout out to my
[39:32.480 --> 39:36.240]  friends at Hitman. Make sure you guys follow Hitman Glass. Make sure you check out hitmanglass.com.

[39:58.680 --> 40:02.600]  I'm going to take a dab out of this Hitman Samson collab and I'll be right back with
[40:02.600 --> 40:10.920]  you. Yeah, what's up podcast world? It's your boy Rasta Jeff coming to you with another
[40:10.920 --> 40:15.880]  episode from the car. I'm headed northbound on I-25. I'm currently passing through the
[40:15.880 --> 40:20.600]  lovely town of Fountain, Colorado. I'm on my way to Colorado Springs. I'm headed to
[40:20.600 --> 40:24.760]  the Grow at Green and Healthy Wellness. I've got to go do the evening check. We are now
[40:24.760 --> 40:29.080]  in flower so I need to go check on the plants just before the lights go off. I need to go
[40:29.080 --> 40:33.080]  make sure that the timer shuts off appropriately and make sure that all the heating and cooling
[40:33.080 --> 40:37.920]  works the way it should for the night cycles. Go check on some clones. Anyway, I've been
[40:37.920 --> 40:41.660]  spending a lot of time on the road. I don't have a lot of time at home or studio time
[40:41.660 --> 40:47.720]  the past week. This weekend was the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational so I spent most of the
[40:47.720 --> 40:52.060]  weekend in Colorado Springs with the Grimy Gatsby family. So I spent most of the weekend
[40:52.060 --> 40:55.400]  in Colorado Springs with the Grimy Gatsby family, the Dude It's Damsel crew and the
[40:55.400 --> 41:00.820]  Terpex boys. I recorded two podcasts that need to be edited and put together from the
[41:00.820 --> 41:06.700]  weekend but they will be out pretty soon. That should be episodes 110 and maybe 112.
[41:06.700 --> 41:11.180]  I might put another episode between there. You never know what I'm going to do. But I've
[41:11.180 --> 41:16.160]  got a couple episodes coming to you from the house in Colorado Springs where we hosted
[41:16.160 --> 41:22.680]  the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational. A house full of models and dab kids. It was a pretty
[41:22.680 --> 41:28.260]  good time I would have to say. I would recommend that you guys go to Instagram. If you're on
[41:28.260 --> 41:32.640]  Instagram go to Instagram and search the hashtag Dude It's Gatsby and check out some
[41:32.640 --> 41:38.520]  of the shots we took there. Also check out some of the shots on Dude It's Damsel's Instagram
[41:38.520 --> 41:42.760]  and also on the Grimy Gatsby on Instagram and of course you can check out my new Instagram
[41:42.760 --> 41:49.140]  irie underscore genetics on Instagram is my new page. I did start a new Instagram you
[41:49.140 --> 41:53.600]  guys I don't know if I've mentioned that on the podcast yet but I am back on Instagram.
[41:53.600 --> 41:57.200]  I'm trying to follow all of the rules. I've been told that you can't put photos of yourself
[41:57.220 --> 42:02.740]  consuming cannabis so that means no dab videos no fat joint shots none of that kind of stuff
[42:02.740 --> 42:08.220]  and I was told that you can't have contact information on your Instagram so I'm not going
[42:08.220 --> 42:12.620]  to put any contact information up there just to keep us safe. You guys know how to find
[42:12.620 --> 42:16.980]  me make sure you go follow the new Instagram page. I was at 19,000 followers they took
[42:16.980 --> 42:22.960]  me down. I'm already back up to about 15 or 1600 by the time this airs. Hopefully with
[42:22.960 --> 42:26.580]  all of the shout outs and things from Damsel. Damsel from the weekend I'll be close to the
[42:26.580 --> 42:33.220]  2500 mark. Anyway that's enough rambling about the dude it's Gatsby Invitational. I
[42:33.220 --> 42:38.000]  really encourage you guys to go look at some of the pictures that were taken on Instagram
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.640]  and we will also post a podcast that tells you all about the dude it's Gatsby Invitational
[42:42.640 --> 42:48.160]  what it is who was involved and why it happened. I've got to edit that down. It's a great show.
[42:48.160 --> 42:52.640]  We got stupid high you guys so it'll be a fun show to listen to. Anyways I'm driving
[42:52.640 --> 42:55.920]  on the interstate I'm kind of rambly. Let's talk about something. I've got a couple of
[42:55.920 --> 42:59.480]  notes here they're hard to read because I'm driving but I wrote this down. I've been watching
[42:59.480 --> 43:04.800]  a show on Netflix a show called Narcos. It's a show about Pablo Escobar and his drug empire
[43:04.800 --> 43:09.440]  that he created. I had no idea the dude was so huge. I knew he was huge but I didn't know
[43:09.440 --> 43:14.020]  that this dude was super huge. This guy I've never seen that kind of money. Nobody else
[43:14.020 --> 43:17.920]  has ever seen that kind of money. That dude was building forts out of hundred dollar bills
[43:17.920 --> 43:21.920]  pretty much. That shit is awesome. Anyway something that happens in the show Narcos.
[43:21.920 --> 43:27.040]  Narcos is on Netflix. It's a 10 season or a 10 episode season. I recommend you watch
[43:27.040 --> 43:30.760]  it. Something that happened recently made me chuckle. I wanted to come out on the show
[43:30.760 --> 43:36.720]  and say that shit will not work. So Pablo Escobar is standing on the balcony having
[43:36.720 --> 43:40.240]  a little thought time by himself. He's just thinking and reflecting and staring off into
[43:40.240 --> 43:44.000]  the nowhere and then he turns to the right and there's a ganja plant to the right of
[43:44.000 --> 43:50.760]  him and it looks it's not mature. It's nowhere near done and Pablo just grabs a little bud
[43:50.760 --> 43:57.080]  off the stalk and pinches it off and gives it a good smell and sticks it into his pocket.
[43:57.080 --> 44:01.560]  You guys that may do a little for him but that weed is going to suck. That plant was
[44:01.560 --> 44:06.680]  not finished. You can't just pick buds off of a plant randomly. It's not like an apple
[44:06.680 --> 44:10.360]  tree. You got to harvest it. You got to trim it. You got to dry it. You got to do it properly.
[44:10.360 --> 44:14.360]  So that was a little goofy but everything about the cocaine, about the production, the
[44:14.360 --> 44:17.880]  shipment, everything about cocaine seems to be accurate. They've talked about how they
[44:17.880 --> 44:22.600]  make cocaine, how they process cocaine, how they hide cocaine. All of that has seemed
[44:22.600 --> 44:27.160]  to be fairly accurately done but when it came to growing a little bit of weed they had no
[44:27.160 --> 44:31.400]  idea what they were talking about on that show. Alright you guys, I wanted to mention
[44:31.400 --> 44:34.320]  that. Let's see, I talked about the Dude It's Gatsby invitation. I'm trying to go through
[44:34.320 --> 44:39.440]  my notes here. So this podcast is going to be a follow up to a recent show. Recently
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.360]  I did an episode that was aimed at how to improve your crop. Once I posted that show
[44:44.440 --> 44:48.200]  I realized there were a couple of things that I really skipped, things that I've been thinking
[44:48.200 --> 44:51.560]  about that would definitely help you improve your crop that I should have mentioned in
[44:51.560 --> 44:54.920]  that show. So let me scroll up on my phone here while I'm driving. Sorry guys, you got
[44:54.920 --> 44:58.600]  to be patient with me. I'm trying to do this safely. More ways to improve your crop. We
[44:58.600 --> 45:03.640]  need to talk about the importance of pH. You hear that? Sorry. We need to talk about the
[45:03.640 --> 45:09.400]  importance of pH. pH stands for potential hydrogen. pH is super important for your plants.
[45:09.400 --> 45:12.920]  When you're making a solution, when you're mixing your nutrients in your bucket or in
[45:12.920 --> 45:17.680]  your reservoir, however you're mixing it, you need to adjust the pH before you feed
[45:17.680 --> 45:23.840]  it to your plants. Mix up all of your nutrients, have everything in there, get a pH meter,
[45:23.840 --> 45:29.000]  stick your pH pen, your pH meter in there and see what the pH says. If it's like seven,
[45:29.000 --> 45:32.280]  it needs to come down. You guys, you want your pH for your plants to be somewhere between
[45:32.280 --> 45:37.300]  six and 6.5. I think you'd be much happier. Your plants will look better. They'll take
[45:37.300 --> 45:42.080]  up the nutrients more properly. The plants will grow better. You won't see as many problems.
[45:42.080 --> 45:48.360]  A lot of times a pH problem will mask itself as a deficiency or a nutrient burn. If you
[45:48.360 --> 45:52.360]  just go ahead and fix your pH, you have to fix the pH of the solution you're feeding
[45:52.360 --> 45:56.720]  your plants. If you're feeding it nutrients, if you're feeding it water, adjust the pH.
[45:56.720 --> 46:01.800]  If you guys are feeding it teas, don't mess with the pH of a tea because the tea is organic.
[46:01.800 --> 46:05.480]  Trying to add something to bring down the pH of your tea will probably kill off your
[46:05.480 --> 46:09.440]  microbes and whatever you're trying to build up in the tea. Just let that go. That'll be
[46:09.440 --> 46:15.960]  fine. Don't stress too much on the pH of your soil. If you bought good soil at a growth store,
[46:15.960 --> 46:21.720]  your pH will be just fine as long as you're feeding it properly pH nutrients, a properly pH
[46:21.720 --> 46:26.920]  solution. So once you're done mixing up your nutrients, pH it. Get some pH. Get a pH pen,
[46:26.920 --> 46:31.600]  stick it in there, see what it says. Add very little pH down. If you're using a five-gallon
[46:31.600 --> 46:38.120]  jug, it's not going to take much pH down to get your pH to drop massively. So check your pH. Pay
[46:38.120 --> 46:41.480]  attention to the pH. I see a lot of people skipping that. They think it's not important.
[46:41.480 --> 46:44.520]  They think it's not going to mess with their plants. They think it's just one more thing
[46:44.520 --> 46:50.160]  to worry about, but it's one more thing that can definitely improve the quality of your plants.
[46:50.160 --> 46:55.560]  All right. So adjust the pH. Also, let's talk about the importance of getting the lights close
[46:55.560 --> 47:00.480]  enough. Oh, excuse me. Got to clear the throat there. I see a lot of people with their lights
[47:00.480 --> 47:04.440]  real high in the garden. If you're using Govitas, you do need that three-foot gap,
[47:04.520 --> 47:08.560]  but unless you're using double-ended bulbs, there's no need to have the bulbs way high
[47:08.560 --> 47:15.840]  above the plants. If you've got the type of hoods that are ducted and have glass inside of them,
[47:15.840 --> 47:21.200]  and if you're venting them properly and the room is air conditioned, you can probably get those
[47:22.080 --> 47:25.520]  light reflectors right down on top of the plants really close. You want to get them...
[47:25.520 --> 47:29.320]  There's a section that comes off the bulb that is kind of too bright for the plant,
[47:29.320 --> 47:35.760]  and those lumens, I guess they are, that are coming off the bulb right there, that spectrum
[47:35.760 --> 47:40.660]  is too much for the plant right around the plant, that eight to 10, maybe 12-inch circle around the
[47:40.660 --> 47:45.760]  bulb. But if you get a little further, about 10, 12, maybe 14 inches away from that thousand-watt
[47:45.760 --> 47:49.560]  bulb, you're going to get optimal growth right there. If you can cool it and keep it cooler,
[47:49.560 --> 47:53.360]  you can get closer and pay attention to the plants and see what's happening. But I see a
[47:53.360 --> 47:57.360]  lot of people that have their lights way too far away from the plants. Get your plants closer to
[47:57.360 --> 48:02.840]  your lights. You want to get that light right on there, nice and intense. Light is the most
[48:02.840 --> 48:07.120]  used nutrient that your plants will receive, so make sure you flood them with light. And also,
[48:07.120 --> 48:11.800]  try to give them the appropriate light. If you're in the veg cycle, you want lights that lean more
[48:11.800 --> 48:16.640]  to the blue spectrum. If you're in the flowering cycle, you want lights that lead more to the red
[48:16.640 --> 48:22.080]  spectrum. All right? So make sure you've got enough light. Try to get your plants close to
[48:22.080 --> 48:26.320]  the light and use as much as you can. And guys, you can burn your plants with your light, so pay
[48:26.320 --> 48:31.040]  attention to that, but get them close. It's what you want to do. All right. Let's see. What does
[48:31.040 --> 48:36.520]  my next note say? My next note says, CO2 enrichment. I didn't write a lot of notes about
[48:36.520 --> 48:40.520]  this, but CO2 enrichment. If you want to improve the quality of your crop, if you want to make
[48:40.520 --> 48:45.680]  your plants grow more quickly, more heartily, and if you want bigger, fatter harvests, add a
[48:45.680 --> 48:49.720]  little bit of CO2 enrichment to your grow room. You can go to the grow store and you can get tanks
[48:49.720 --> 48:54.760]  of CO2 and you can get a setup to distribute the CO2 properly through your room. You may have to
[48:55.160 --> 49:00.680]  rethink your ducting and your ventilation situation if you're going to do that, but CO2 will drastically
[49:00.680 --> 49:05.240]  increase the quality of your grow. Maybe not the quality completely, but the harvest weight,
[49:05.240 --> 49:10.920]  you will definitely see a difference. The ambient air outside and in your grow room probably
[49:10.920 --> 49:18.120]  contains about 400 particles per million of CO2. If you get an enrichment system, maybe a CO2
[49:18.120 --> 49:22.600]  burner, maybe some tanks, whatever you decide to do, you're going to have to think about that one
[49:22.600 --> 49:26.920]  and talk to the guys at the hydro shop, maybe do some research on that. If you're going to put CO2
[49:26.920 --> 49:31.560]  in your room, you're going to need to think about how to do it. But my point is, you can get that
[49:31.560 --> 49:37.400]  CO2 up to like 1600 ppm. You can get it four times what it is in the natural environment and your
[49:37.400 --> 49:42.760]  plants will love it. Those plants want to suck up the CO2. So you can add CO2 to your grow and that
[49:42.760 --> 49:48.120]  would greatly increase your harvest weight. So if you're going to add CO2 and you're going to start
[49:48.120 --> 49:52.200]  getting bigger buds, something that really helps with all gardens and something I'm learning now
[49:52.200 --> 49:57.480]  that I'm running this giant commercial garden is trellising. You guys trellising and like a screen
[49:57.480 --> 50:03.880]  of green method, if you can set up a scrog, that is a huge way to improve your crop. You will give
[50:03.880 --> 50:10.680]  yourself more canopy space. More canopy space gives you more room to grow more buds. Everybody
[50:10.680 --> 50:15.320]  wants more buds. Also, you're able to get more airflow to the bottom of the plants, the plants
[50:15.320 --> 50:22.200]  like that. I think that a scrog is the way to go. I'll do a whole episode on how to do a scrog when
[50:22.200 --> 50:26.200]  I'm in the studio and I'm not on the road because I would definitely want to pay a little bit of
[50:26.200 --> 50:31.320]  attention. Spence and I talked about it a while back, but I wasn't sold on the idea and I wasn't
[50:31.320 --> 50:37.000]  exactly sure how to do it. So I didn't do the idea justice, but you guys, we will talk about how to
[50:37.000 --> 50:43.400]  scrog on a future episode. All right. So use some sort of trellising system, a screen of green, a net,
[50:43.400 --> 50:47.320]  get those plants in there and get them supported, get them spread out. That would definitely help
[50:47.320 --> 50:51.800]  with your garden. Something that I see a lot of people neglecting to do that I think would
[50:51.800 --> 50:56.760]  greatly improve the quality of your garden. It'll also save your tremors, a lot of headaches. You
[50:56.760 --> 51:01.880]  guys, I think it would be really useful for you to get in there and lollipop your plants a little
[51:01.880 --> 51:07.880]  bit. So what that means is from the bottom of the plant up, take off all the branches that don't
[51:07.880 --> 51:12.280]  have a useful bud site. There is that don't look like they're going to create a chunky bud.
[51:12.280 --> 51:17.720]  Just cut those off. About 10 days into flower, you'll know where you're going to have buds.
[51:17.720 --> 51:22.840]  If the light is not getting to that area, just pinch that little starter of a bud. Just pinch
[51:22.840 --> 51:28.040]  that right off. All those little tiny sucker stems that are growing off your main stock at the bottom
[51:28.040 --> 51:33.000]  of the plant that are going to make little shitty flowers that nobody wants to trim, cut that shit
[51:33.000 --> 51:38.200]  off of there. And that will allow that plant to use its energy to produce bigger buds up top.
[51:38.200 --> 51:42.840]  You won't have all that crap on the bottom. You'll get better airflow. A lot of people say
[51:42.840 --> 51:46.360]  they want to use those bottom buds for hash. That's cool if you want to do that. If you're
[51:46.360 --> 51:51.880]  trying to grow buds with bag appeal, big fatty, chunky nuggets, cut that stuff off of there and
[51:51.880 --> 51:55.720]  you will have better results. You'll have better airflow. And then you won't have to trim all that
[51:55.720 --> 51:59.160]  little popcorn crap because that's what sucks at the end. All that just gets chopped up and put
[51:59.160 --> 52:04.360]  into the hash pile anyway. So do some lollipopping, get in there and clean all the bottom buds,
[52:05.080 --> 52:09.640]  just the bottom crap off the plant before it even has time to suck up the nutrients and suck up the
[52:09.640 --> 52:13.800]  energy of the plant. Just get that right off of there and allow that energy to go up to the top.
[52:14.520 --> 52:19.560]  All right. So let's see something that people really don't think about that I think could
[52:19.560 --> 52:23.720]  truly benefit the quality of your garden and the health of your plants, the overall health of your
[52:23.720 --> 52:30.520]  plants. It's winter time here in Colorado and the grow room floor is getting cold. My personal
[52:30.520 --> 52:35.240]  grow is in a basement. Something I would recommend to get your pots up off the ground, you guys,
[52:35.240 --> 52:39.480]  get your plants off the ground. A really easy way to do it if you can't build something, if you can't
[52:39.480 --> 52:44.680]  build a table, I would recommend getting like a four by four botanic care tray and just build
[52:44.680 --> 52:48.760]  yourself a little table that'll support the tray and your plants. Just lift it up, whatever's
[52:48.760 --> 52:52.920]  comfortable for you, two to four feet off the ground. Usually about 30 inches is the height
[52:52.920 --> 52:58.840]  people go. 36 inches is kind of high for me. I'm tall. I don't need it that high. So just get your
[52:58.840 --> 53:03.720]  plants up off the ground. The floor is cold. You don't want those cold pots on the cold floor.
[53:03.720 --> 53:07.080]  You're going to water them. The water is going to stay in the pot. You've got water down there in
[53:07.080 --> 53:11.320]  the root ball and that water is going to get cold because the floor is so cold when the lights go
[53:11.320 --> 53:15.320]  off at night. So raise your pots up off the ground. I was going to tell you a cheap and effective way
[53:15.320 --> 53:19.800]  to do that. Buy an extra pot. If you're running a seven gallon pot and you've got your plant in
[53:19.800 --> 53:24.360]  there, get yourself another seven gallon pot and flip it upside down and just set your seven gallon
[53:24.360 --> 53:28.600]  pot right on top of there and you'll be just fine. So that's a cheap effective way to get your
[53:28.600 --> 53:33.480]  plants up off the ground. Your plants are going to, it's going to look like your plants are happier
[53:33.480 --> 53:37.800]  just one night of having them up off the ground. They'll grow more quickly. The buds will develop
[53:37.800 --> 53:42.600]  much larger. It'll taste better. The plants will act happier. And that cold floor will also
[53:42.600 --> 53:47.160]  describe disguise itself as a pH or a nutrient problem. You'll be thinking what's going on with
[53:47.160 --> 53:51.480]  my crop. Your floor is too cold and your plants are pissed off. You don't like to get up in the
[53:51.480 --> 53:56.040]  morning and walk across a cold floor on your bare feet. That sucks. So don't make your plants do it.
[53:56.040 --> 54:00.200]  Get them up off the ground and that may help you get them a little bit closer to the light as well.
[54:00.200 --> 54:03.720]  I may have just put you in danger of getting too close to the light, but that's something that the
[54:03.720 --> 54:08.520]  trellising we're going to talk about in another episode will help you out with. So get your plants
[54:08.520 --> 54:12.280]  up off the ground. You guys, I'm in a traffic area, so I can't really look at my notes right now.
[54:14.120 --> 54:17.160]  So while I'm driving right here, I'm just going to give a huge shout out to Hitman Glass because
[54:17.160 --> 54:21.480]  Hitman Glass sponsors the show. And there's nothing like taking a fat dab out of a Hitman rig.
[54:21.480 --> 54:24.920]  All right, we're getting out of the traffic area. I can look down at the phone once again and see
[54:24.920 --> 54:31.400]  what the next one is. All right, here we go. Check your PPMs of your solution. When you guys are
[54:31.400 --> 54:37.160]  mixing up your nutrients to feed your plants, pay attention to the PPMs. PPM stands for particles
[54:37.160 --> 54:43.320]  per million. That will tell you how much stuff is in the water or the solution that you have created.
[54:43.320 --> 54:48.600]  So if you're using reverse osmosis water, it'll start off at zero PPMs. Most tap water is going
[54:48.600 --> 54:54.440]  to come out fairly low. The tap water where I am at home comes out about 400 PPMs. It changes
[54:54.440 --> 55:00.360]  seasonally. They add stuff to it, but we're usually about the 400 PPM area. You can feed your plants,
[55:01.880 --> 55:05.640]  if you know what you're doing, you can feed them really high. I've gotten into the 2000s.
[55:05.640 --> 55:11.000]  People tell me I'm crazy for feeding my plants 2000 PPMs, but I'm paying very close attention
[55:11.000 --> 55:15.560]  to what I'm giving them. I'm not doubling up on anything. They're getting a broad array of
[55:15.560 --> 55:20.760]  nutrients instead of just getting really heavily blasted with phosphorus. So I would recommend that
[55:20.760 --> 55:26.040]  you don't go much higher than 1200 PPMs when you're mixing up your nutrients. What you can do,
[55:26.680 --> 55:29.960]  if you've got a big reservoir, if you're using... This is going to be a little harder if you're
[55:29.960 --> 55:34.120]  using a five gallon bucket because you don't get as much wiggle room. But if you're using
[55:34.840 --> 55:40.920]  like a 25 gallon res or a 50 gallon res from the hydro shop, fill it up maybe like 40 gallons.
[55:40.920 --> 55:44.120]  If you've got a 50 gallon res, fill it up to about 40 gallons. If you've got a 25,
[55:44.120 --> 55:48.360]  fill it up to about 15 or 20. Then mix your nutrients the way you normally would,
[55:48.360 --> 55:51.480]  put your PPM meter in there. And it's going to show you that it's too high right now,
[55:51.480 --> 55:55.800]  but all you got to do is just run normal water. Or if you've got reverse osmosis water,
[55:55.800 --> 56:03.400]  just add normal clean non-solution mixed water to it until it comes to about 16 or 1800 PPMs and
[56:03.400 --> 56:08.520]  feed that to your plant. You can mix it up and then dilute it until it's at the right dilution
[56:08.520 --> 56:12.280]  and everything will be at the right ratios. You've still mixed the same amount of grow A,
[56:12.280 --> 56:16.680]  the same amount of grow B, the same amount of cow and mag. Everything will be the same. It's just,
[56:16.680 --> 56:20.760]  you've diluted it to a proper solution that your plants are going to love. And then take notes,
[56:20.760 --> 56:25.800]  feed your plants the solution that was at 1600 PPMs and see how they react. If you think you
[56:25.800 --> 56:29.880]  want to mix it a little heavier next time and mix it up to 18, feed it to them and see what they do.
[56:29.880 --> 56:34.680]  Don't go too heavy. Don't go past 18. Pay attention to your PPMs. But I think that is
[56:34.680 --> 56:38.120]  something that will really help you guys out. This guy just passed me on the right going about
[56:38.120 --> 56:41.960]  90 miles an hour playing on his phone. That's crazy shit. I can't talk too much shit. I'm doing
[56:41.960 --> 56:46.120]  a podcast while I drive, but still at least put your phone down if you're going to pass me on the
[56:46.120 --> 56:50.600]  right. All right, you guys, I'm coming up on the Fillmore exit. I'm going to go handle some plants
[56:50.600 --> 56:55.560]  at the Green and Healthy Wellness Garden. I will be back in the car in just a couple of hours and
[56:55.560 --> 57:00.520]  I will do more of this podcast and we will all have a good time. So hang out. I'll be right back.
[57:01.240 --> 57:06.280]  All right, Podcast World, I am back. It's your boy Rasta Jeff. I just got done putting in about
[57:06.280 --> 57:11.640]  two and a half or three hours in the grow. I had to fill up some reservoirs. We've got three
[57:11.640 --> 57:16.840]  gigantic reservoirs. We've got a drip system set up to where every about two and a half hours,
[57:17.560 --> 57:21.720]  the drip system comes on for about a minute and a half and waters the plants. So I just have to
[57:21.720 --> 57:26.280]  make sure that the reservoirs are full, that they're filled and they are mixed with nutrients
[57:26.280 --> 57:31.480]  and properly pH. So I did that. I checked on the clones. The clones look marvelous. I'm not
[57:31.480 --> 57:35.160]  really good at cutting clones in rock wool, but this batch is looking pretty nice for me.
[57:35.960 --> 57:40.200]  I checked on all the plants. The plants look glorious. You guys, today is day two of flower.
[57:41.160 --> 57:44.280]  They're taking off. I can see that they've already started to stretch a little tiny bit
[57:44.280 --> 57:48.600]  since yesterday. I know that sounds ridiculous, but they have definitely done some growth.
[57:49.320 --> 57:53.000]  So I checked the tanks. I checked the clones. I checked on all the plants. The plants look happy.
[57:53.000 --> 57:56.200]  They're starting to flower. They're not showing, but I mean, they're starting the flowering
[57:56.680 --> 58:02.120]  now. And then I had to tinker with the Govita controller. So we got that working all set up.
[58:02.120 --> 58:07.880]  Those plants are going to be super duper happy. Now I'm on the road headed South back to Pueblo
[58:07.880 --> 58:12.760]  from lovely Colorado Springs. It is now dark. The temperature has dropped dramatically.
[58:13.320 --> 58:18.920]  I'm just now headed past the, which exit am I at here? The Fort Carson, the Mesa Ridge Parkway,
[58:18.920 --> 58:23.320]  Fort Carson exit. We're at mile marker 132. None of that is relevant. I'm just talking
[58:23.320 --> 58:27.640]  because it is what's on my mind. Let's get back to where we were, you guys.
[58:28.680 --> 58:34.680]  This episode was about ways, more ways to improve your garden. We talked about CO2 enrichment. We
[58:34.680 --> 58:40.840]  talked a little bit about trellising. I want to talk about trellising for a second. So trellising,
[58:40.840 --> 58:45.240]  we'll go back to that. Trellising is when you take like a net, like a five by five net with about
[58:45.240 --> 58:50.760]  either four inch or six inch squares, spaces between the netting. You got about four inch
[58:50.760 --> 58:55.720]  or six inch holes in there. So I would take the net and just, you got to stretch it tight,
[58:55.720 --> 59:00.600]  but build like a five foot frame or attach it to some poles and just lay that right over the canopy
[59:00.600 --> 59:05.960]  of your plants while you're in veg. Just drop that right over and pull it tight. And then what I do
[59:06.680 --> 59:11.560]  is I grab the branches from the plants and I make sure that one branch is sticking through each
[59:11.560 --> 59:17.080]  square of that trellis. So this will, it'll do a few things. It'll separate the plant. It's where
[59:17.080 --> 59:21.560]  you don't have a bunch of branches all clumped up into one area, which will allow more of the
[59:21.560 --> 59:26.200]  plant to get more light. It will also work as a support for the plant. When the plant starts
[59:26.200 --> 59:30.600]  getting chunky buds and the plant starts getting taller and stretching, it's going to need some
[59:30.600 --> 59:35.880]  support. So every branch will be supported by this trellis. So it'll also spread the plant out.
[59:36.440 --> 59:40.440]  It'll give you a little space and it'll do, it'll create what I call the little grid.
[59:40.440 --> 59:45.000]  You'll be able to grow on the grid. You'll have more bud sites per square foot than most people
[59:45.000 --> 59:48.680]  because you have gone and stretched out your canopy and spread it out in this trellis. So
[59:48.680 --> 59:53.880]  in veg a couple of weeks before flower, drop that trellis on and start making the plants grow into
[59:53.880 --> 59:58.040]  the trellis and get them stretched out the way you want. Then I would recommend flowering. Once
[59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.400]  they're all up through there, you've got a node coming through every part of the trellis. You're
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:05.480]  comfortable with the height of your plants. And you guys, if something's getting too high,
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.240]  all you got to do is grab it and bend it down back under that trellis. And then it'll start
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.880]  growing up again. Cannabis wants to grow up. That's what it'll do. So if you bend a branch down
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:18.600]  and stick it in that trellis, it will grow itself back up. So after a couple of weeks,
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.760]  you put the plants in flower after they've veged into the trellis and grown comfortably,
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.720]  then you put them in flower. And then just a couple of weeks after flower, maybe 10 days
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:31.160]  after flower, I would recommend putting up another trellis, maybe less than 10 days,
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:36.760]  maybe seven days, put up another trellis, just about 18 inches higher than that first one.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:40.120]  Your plants are going to start budding and they're going to grow right into that trellis,
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.280]  maybe 16 inches. If you're at a home grow, we're doing a commercial grow. We're going about 18
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.920]  inches to give them some space, maybe 24, just depends on how fast they grow by then. But you
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.640]  want them to grow up into that trellis to where those top colas have more space to lean. They're
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:58.200]  going to kind of lean on those trellis wires. So make sure you pull the trellis tight when you put
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:03.000]  it up there, get it at the right height to begin with. Pull the branch nodes through that trellis.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Don't be shy. Be careful not to break them, but don't be shy to get in there and just kind of
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.520]  reshape that plant, make it go the direction you want. And then get it growing into that trellis
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.160]  squares and then add the other trellis a little bit into flower and then keep the buds growing
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:22.600]  through that. And you'll be able to create more bud sites, more buds, more harvest weight without
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.760]  adding more light or without using more space in your grow room. And I find that to be a huge
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.400]  improvement. So something else I want to touch on, you guys, this is a major important factor
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:38.200]  that people overlook. They say that cleanliness is next to godliness. So something that would
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.760]  really improve your garden, you guys, just clean up after yourselves. Get in the garden and clean
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:46.680]  up. If it doesn't need to be in there, take it out of there. You don't need to have the broom and
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:51.240]  dustpan in there overnight when you're not using it. If you've got a trash can in your grow room,
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.000]  make sure there's a lid on it. I would recommend taking that trash can out of the grow room at
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.520]  night. Don't have anything in the room that doesn't need to be in there. Clean up all that crap in the
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:04.280]  corner, whatever you've got over there. If it's your nutrients, if it's your notes, if it's your
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.840]  gear, clean that up. Take that out of the grow room. If you've got leaves on the floor, get those
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:13.480]  leaves up off the floor. Now here's something I'm going to kind of contradict myself with, but
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:20.280]  I think it's really important to have a super clean grow room. Cleanliness will keep bugs away.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.680]  Cleanliness just helps you keep everything more organized. It keeps healthier plants.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:29.640]  But here's something that I'm going to add to this. Around week six or seven, your plants are
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.640]  going to start getting really sticky. They're going to start producing resin. The trichomes
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:38.680]  are going to get fat. The plants are going to want to stick to everything. If you're a girl
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.720]  or a dude with long hair, you'll notice that every time you walk past the ganja plants,
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.400]  you leave some hair in them. If you're a pot photographer, you'll notice that every time you
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:50.760]  try to take a picture, that one killer bud has got a dog hair or a people hair or a kitty hair
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:57.400]  or some kind of hair in it. What I'm getting at you guys is these sticky plants love to collect
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:03.240]  everything. You're going to give them about 21 to 25 days of straight sticky collection time.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.800]  They're going to be sticky for three weeks. In that whole time, they're acting like fly paper
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:14.040]  and just collecting everything that's in that room. My advice to you guys is try to control
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:19.080]  the dust that's in the air in your grow room. Try to control the particulates and hair that
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.840]  that are flying around in your grow room. Try to minimize all of that stuff because it's going to
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:30.680]  stick to your buds and end up in your buds. These days, most of the people in Colorado and
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:36.600]  California in a legal state that are producing a grow, at least half of the grows are being turned
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:41.480]  into extracts, which means they're being blasted with butane. They're being turned into water hash.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:46.040]  They're being turned into some sort of concentrate. What's going to happen is you're going
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.840]  in your grow room and you're not cleaning up after yourself and you're mixing soil for your
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.720]  next batch or whatever you do in there and you get dust all in the air, you get soil all in the air.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:00.520]  All of that shit is going to stick to your trichomes, all of it. Then you're going to
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:04.200]  smoke those plants and they're going to taste like dusty dirt. Then you're going to extract it
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:10.200]  and make hash out of it. All that dust and dirt and shit and dog hair is going to be in your
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:16.200]  concentrates. I really recommend you keep the grow room clean. Try to minimize dust and hair
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.800]  in the air. You can get a carbon scrubber. Just throw a tall carbon filter on the floor,
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:26.280]  point it straight up, put a blower on top of it and just put that sucker by your door,
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:32.760]  kind of near the door. That way, any air that is drawn in, any particles will get sucked up by your
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:38.200]  carbon filter, hopefully. Also, on any intakes going into the room, I would recommend putting
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:43.640]  a HEPA filter over all of the holes or all of the ducting into the room so you're not bringing in
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:49.880]  crap from outside. I definitely don't recommend bringing in air from the outside that has not
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:55.080]  been filtered and treated for temperature. Right now, it's the winter. If you were to bring in,
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:58.760]  it's going to be probably 20 something degrees tonight, I'm guessing.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:03.640]  If you're running your lights at night and you bring in that 20 degree air over your plants,
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:07.160]  you're going to cause powdery mildew issue. You're bringing in frosty cold air,
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.440]  you're introducing it into a warm grow room environment. That is a great way
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:16.600]  to create powdery mildew situations. Pay attention to what you're bringing in the room.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:21.400]  Be clean. That's my point, you guys. Every leaf on the floor is a spot for a bug to hide.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:25.800]  Every piece of crap that you've got in there is another place for a bug to hide. It's a place for
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:31.320]  a mold spore to start growing. Just be clean. Cleanliness is very important in the grow room.
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:36.680]  All right, you guys, I think that's what I've got for you for ways to improve your garden for now.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:41.320]  All right, guys, I want to thank you for listening to another episode. I don't think that the car
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:46.360]  episodes are up to my quality standards. The sound quality and the amount of attention I am allowed
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:51.160]  to give a show doesn't seem like it's fair to the listener. I am going to probably stop doing the car
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:56.440]  episodes. If I do a car episode, it'll just be something ranty. It won't be something educational
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:01.320]  or detailed. I appreciate it. If you made it through this episode, I truly do appreciate it.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:05.960]  Thanks for listening. I'll be back next week with the Dude It's Gatsby
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:11.160]  invitational recap that features the lovely Dude It's Damsel. We've got Hunt on the mic for a
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:16.120]  little bit of that show and four other lovely ladies. Our friend Chris from The Clitter jumps
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:20.440]  in for a little bit. It's a great podcast. I'll have that edited and cleaned up and ready for you
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:25.240]  guys by next Monday. So I got seven days to get that out for you. No worries at all. You guys,
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:29.560]  make sure you check out our sponsors. Don't forget about Hitman Glass. This podcast is brought to you
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:35.000]  by our good friends at Hitman Glass. Hitman Glass, glass made in America by Americans. You guys,
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.680]  I've said it before when I'm shopping for a rig, I like to know that what I'm paying for is going
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:42.440]  to give me a big fat dab. I don't want to get water splashed in my face. I don't want to get a
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:47.000]  dry dab because there's not enough water in there. You guys don't trust a rig that was made in China
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.720]  by a Chinese kid with no eye protection. Probably wasn't wearing shoes. He didn't get paid enough.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:56.200]  Don't buy some glass made in China. You guys buy American glass made by an American. It'll make you
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:01.160]  feel better. Hitman's not only a glass company, you guys. Hitman Dougie is a huge part of the

[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:35.000]  Irie is a Jamaican word. It means to feel as blessed as you can feel. It means to just be
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.240]  as powerful as powerful could be. When you're sitting there with your best friend or your
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.600]  lady friend or whoever, it could be your dog or by yourself, but when you're sitting there and
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:46.680]  you just feel good and the wind is blowing through your hair, you don't got a problem
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.280]  in the world right now. Everything just feels good. You're like, yeah, that feeling that comes
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:55.960]  over you, you're feeling Irie. That is Irie right there. We got the Irie genetics. Anyway, go to

[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.520]  There's no prescription for me
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:18.360]  She's the one, the only remedy
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.360]  Only you alone can quench this
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.360]  Pain is getting worse

[01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:18.070]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:20.070]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:22.070]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:24.070]  for letting me use their music on my show.
[01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:28.070]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:29.070]  What's up, everybody?
[01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:30.070]  I hope you guys are having a great evening,
[01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:32.070]  afternoon, morning, whatever time it is, wherever you are.
[01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:35.070]  Hope you're hanging out, getting some turps in your head.
[01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:36.070]  Hope you're smoking a fat joint.
[01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:38.070]  Hope you got a vaporizer packed up.
[01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:39.070]  Hope you got a dab ready.
[01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:40.070]  Hope you got the e-mail turned on.
[01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:42.070]  Maybe you're eating some edibles.
[01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:43.070]  You might be smoking a blunt.
[01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:44.070]  That's like not my favorite.
[01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:46.070]  But if you're smoking a blunt, more power to you.
[01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:47.070]  Do what you gotta do.
[01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:48.070]  Get it in your head.
[01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:49.070]  Get them turps in your mind.
[01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:50.070]  Set yourself free.
[01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:52.070]  You guys, this is gonna be a great episode.
[01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:55.070]  This is the episode that I recorded in Colorado Springs
[01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:57.070]  from the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational.
[01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:59.070]  There are a lot of great folks in this episode.
[01:15:59.070 --> 01:16:02.070]  This episode features the Grimy Gatsby.
[01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:04.070]  This episode features Chris from the Clear Concentrates.
[01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:08.070]  And it definitely features a whole bunch of lovely ladies.
[01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:11.070]  Before we get to that, this podcast is brought to you
[01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:13.070]  by our great friends at Hitman Glass.
[01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:14.070]  That's right, Hitman Glass.
[01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:17.070]  You guys, today I'm sitting over here hitting the Hitman
[01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:19.070]  mini sidecar with the Hammerhead.
[01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:22.070]  I grabbed this one because it's got a yellow label on it.
[01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:24.070]  And I haven't seen a lot of Hitman with a yellow label.
[01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:25.070]  I really liked it.
[01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:26.070]  Thought it looked fresh.
[01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:28.070]  The Hammerhead perk in this thing, you guys.
[01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:29.070]  Oh, my God.
[01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:30.070]  This thing hits like a fucking boss.
[01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:31.070]  You know what I'm talking about.
[01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:33.070]  I'm gonna heat this up for a second here while I'm rambling
[01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:35.070]  about Hitman Glass.
[01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:36.070]  Let's see.
[01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:37.070]  What else do I have to say?
[01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:38.070]  But I'm gonna heat this up.
[01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:39.070]  We're gonna take a fat dab of some Gorilla...
[01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:40.070]  What is it?
[01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:41.070]  What do we got?
[01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:43.070]  Some Gorilla glue, live resin from the Garden of Whedon.
[01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:44.070]  So let's take a dab here.
[01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:46.070]  But this podcast is brought to you by our good friends
[01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:48.070]  at Hitman Glass.
[01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.070]  When I'm shopping for a rig, you guys, I want a rig that I know
[01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:51.070]  is gonna hit like a truck.
[01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:53.070]  It's not gonna splash water in my mouth.
[01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:56.070]  And I also want a rig made by an American in America and not
[01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:59.070]  made by some Chinese kid without protective eyewear,
[01:16:59.070 --> 01:17:01.070]  with no shoes, and not getting paid.
[01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:03.070]  So, you guys, I represent Hitman Glass.
[01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:05.070]  Buy glass made in America.
[01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:08.070]  Hitman Glass is a huge part of the cannabis and hash movement.

[01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:32.680]  Let's do this.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.680]  All right, you guys, I'm nice and turped out.

[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:43.680]  Let's get into the episode.
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:46.680]  Let's time travel back a few days to Colorado Springs.
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:48.680]  You guys, it was a lovely snowy afternoon.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.680]  There were a bunch of lovely ladies in the house.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.680]  There were a bunch of turpy dudes in the house.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:57.680]  There was a table covered in great food and good hash and good weed.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:58.680]  So, it was a party.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:01.680]  Let's let the music take us right into that part of the episode,
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:06.680]  and then I'll be back to wrap up the show after that.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.680]  All right, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:08.680]  It's your boy, Rasta Jeff.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:12.680]  I am here in beautiful Colorado Springs looking out a giant window,
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:13.680]  looking at a lovely day.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:15.680]  It's snowing like a son of a bitch.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.680]  It's gorgeous out there.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.680]  Sitting across from me, you guys, I am here at the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational,
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.680]  and sitting across from me is the lovely Dude It's Damsel.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:26.680]  How are you doing today?
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:30.680]  I'm really good and really high.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.680]  It sounds and looks like the weed that I grew is working for the whole house.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:35.680]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:37.680]  There is no doubt about that.
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:41.680]  We've all been stone silly for four days now.
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:42.680]  Nice.
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.680]  I like that.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.680]  I like that.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:45.680]  Well, our friend Brittany is joining us.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:46.680]  She's known as Dude It's Damsel.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:47.680]  Her real name is Brittany.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:48.680]  Hey, thanks for being on the show.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:49.680]  I appreciate that.
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.680]  Yeah, of course, man, anytime.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.680]  She brought four or five.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.680]  I can't even count how many lovely ladies there are.
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.680]  She brought four beautiful model friends with her.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:59.680]  I'm just going to go from the left and introduce all the ladies.
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.680]  Sitting to my left is Miss Amanda.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:02.680]  What do they call you on Instagram?
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:06.680]  Ackley Rocks, R-A-W-K-S.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:07.680]  There you go, guys.

[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.680]  Pass the mic for me.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:13.680]  Oh, you've got a mic.
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:14.680]  Never mind.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:15.680]  I'll give you a mic.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.680]  Sitting right in front of me.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:17.680]  Sorry, guys.
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:18.680]  I'm really high, too.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.680]  I just hide it better.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:20.680]  Sitting in front of me is my new friend, Shana.
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:21.680]  Hey, I'm just Shana.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.680]  Just Shana?
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:23.680]  Yep.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:24.680]  Do you have an Instagram you want to shout out?
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:25.680]  No.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:26.680]  Okay.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:27.680]  I'm super good.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.680]  Awesome.
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:29.680]  She's a great photographer, you guys.
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:30.680]  She was taking some great pictures this weekend.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:31.680]  Hopefully, we'll talk more about that.
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:32.680]  I'm going to give everybody a heads up.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:36.680]  Make sure you check out Instagram, hashtag DudeItsGatsby,
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.680]  and look at some of the pictures that are posted there.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.680]  I've got a ton of those.
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:44.680]  Sitting at my noon position here is Tristan.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.680]  How you doing?
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.680]  What's up?
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.680]  I'm doing good.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.680]  Good.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.680]  What's your Instagram handle so people can stalk you while they're listening?
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.680]  Oh, man.
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:51.680]  Tristan Renee is my Instagram.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:52.680]  All right.
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:53.680]  How do you spell Renee at the end there?
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.680]  I know it's different.
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:55.680]  R-E-N-A.
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.680]  I'm a little special.

[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:03.680]  Do we call you Jackie?
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.680]  Jacqueline, please.
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:05.680]  Jacqueline, please.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:06.680]  All right.

[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:11.680]  Make sure you follow her, guys.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:12.680]  She's taking some great pictures this weekend.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:13.680]  Thanks for joining me, ladies.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.680]  I really appreciate it.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:15.680]  Yeah, we're super stoked.
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:19.680]  Over here, he's got to grab his mic, blow out his dab, get his shit together.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:20.680]  Cough a little bit.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:21.680]  This is my buddy, Jon Hunt.
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:22.680]  How you doing, brother?
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:23.680]  What's going down?
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:24.680]  Hanging out, man.
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.680]  This is my buddy, the Grimy Gatsby.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.680]  This is the man, the myth, the terp gatherer, the legend.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.680]  Thanks for joining me, man.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:28.680]  Hi.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.680]  Hi.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.680]  I'm faded, bro.
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:31.680]  I just took the biggest dab.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:35.680]  I'm all stupid, blown out right now, and I'm trying to talk without coughing.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:36.680]  You can cough on this show.
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:37.680]  This show will be filled with coughs.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:38.680]  That's no problem.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:39.680]  Thanks for coming out, bro.
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:40.680]  Dude, thanks for having me.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:43.680]  This is a gorgeous house, a gorgeous location, some gorgeous friends and family.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.680]  Thank you.
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:47.680]  Also in the room, you guys, we're going to do another podcast after this, and we'll feature
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.680]  these guys, but also in the room, we got Jordan from TerpX.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:54.680]  We got our buddy, Dan, from CCC420, and to my left, my new friend, Chris, from The Clear,
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:55.680]  The Clear Scientist.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:56.680]  Dude, thanks for jumping in.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:59.680]  Yeah, we're going to do a show with all these guys here in just a minute.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:03.680]  We may get the guitar out again, if you guys remember what happened on that episode.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:05.680]  It got a little Terp sloppy.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.680]  Yeah, we might do that.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:08.680]  So I've got a bunch of notes here on the phone.
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.680]  I should probably open that stuff up and start getting on it.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:16.680]  First, before we get too far, I need to learn a little bit about the Dude, It's Gatsby Invitational.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.680]  Do you guys want to tell me all about that?
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.680]  Sure.
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:27.680]  So I've kind of been organizing these shoot fests for a few years.
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:32.680]  I used to do it for a different company where I would bring a bunch of girls and photographers
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:37.680]  to different locations, and we would make a whole bunch of art and have a really good time.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:43.680]  It was kind of an excuse for all of us to get together, even though we are spread across the country.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:50.680]  I thought, why not do that for cannabis products and for businesses?
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:59.680]  So I kind of ran the idea past Hunt, and he was like, that could actually happen.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.680]  It was kind of just an idea.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:02.680]  I thought, wouldn't it be cool?
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:06.680]  I really just wanted an excuse to bring my friends somewhere and watch them run around naked.
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:08.680]  We appreciate that.
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:20.680]  Yeah, he said that we could make it a real thing, and lots of hard work and planning and some sweet sponsors later.
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:25.680]  And a lot of these guys here teaching me how to be a boss.
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.680]  You already knew how to be a boss before I met you.
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.680]  Well, maybe.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:36.680]  I think lifestyle marketing and content creation in general is something that numerous businesses,
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.680]  whether big or small, are utilizing in different aspects.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:49.680]  With the GG Fam and different kind of aspects, and I actually met Damsel at one of those shoots before,
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:55.680]  giving a cannabis class to the photo shoot and doing some cannabis consulting.
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:02.680]  With the people that are in the room now, there's a massive imprint and footprint, so to speak,
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:08.680]  on how social media and social engineering and lifestyle marketing comes to be very effective.
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:14.680]  It was kind of a double-edged sword with bringing the right people together,
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:20.680]  but also getting the right brands together to be able to represent what Damsel does really well and what we can put together.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.680]  And what brands were part of the event this time?
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.680]  Is this the first event you guys have done like this?
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:27.680]  This is the first one. The first ever.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.680]  The first of its kind.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.680]  So who joined on for this one?
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.680]  I can rattle them off pretty fast.
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.680]  Let's hear it, bro. They all deserve a shout out.
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:38.680]  We have all kinds of different companies came to be.
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:42.680]  Obviously, iReGenetics had a nice part with some of the stuff we've been putting in the air for the week.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:49.680]  Apothecanna came through with a bunch of great holistic topicals that we've been using and also having some great shoots.
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:56.680]  Turpex is an unbelievable sponsor that not only has done all this stuff from sponsoring the vehicles to other aspects,
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:00.680]  the Clear Concentrate as well as their whole subsidiary of brands.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:01.680]  How about that popcorn?
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.680]  Was that popcorn from the Clear?
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.680]  Yeah, I went like a thousand milligrams deep yesterday.
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:08.680]  That popcorn, oh man, I slept like an infant.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.680]  I was like, I think something's moving.
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:13.680]  I looked and I was like, my hand's on the wall. How's something moving?
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.680]  I looked down and I was like, wait, that's me just trembling right now.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:16.680]  Just trembling.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.680]  Trying to get it together as I'm rolling.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.680]  Yeah, so the Clear came through huge.
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:24.680]  Chris coming out in person is a blessing in general, just having out the scientists.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.680]  The mats.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.680]  Mood mats.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.680]  Yeah, mood mats came through.
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:33.680]  They sent out a box of rubber that you could literally wear as a jacket and stay warm for the whole winter.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:38.680]  It was mats that can cover that coffee table right there that we're staring at and all kinds of nice shit.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.680]  Quick at your mom's table all sticky.
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:41.680]  Yeah.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:44.680]  Green and Healthy Wellness.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:48.680]  We had some places there that we shot at and saw what was going down with that.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:51.680]  There are, what other ones?
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:54.680]  That, yeah, that's it.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:58.680]  All of the people that are here, obviously, all the ladies and their brands.
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:00.680]  Shout out to all the ladies that are traveling.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.680]  This was a huge success.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:10.680]  We brought out a bunch of veteran models and a veteran photographer and girls that are really used to pitching in and doing their share of the work and helping out.
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:14.680]  We all get along really well, but we know how to work really hard to get the job done.
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:16.680]  It was a lot of work and a lot of play.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:22.680]  We just had a really great group of girls that are really good friends spread across the country.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:24.680]  When we get together, it's like nothing changed.
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:25.680]  It's been awesome.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.680]  We keep talking about friends from across the country.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:29.680]  Where is everybody in the room from?
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:30.680]  I'm from LA.
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:31.680]  Okay.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:32.680]  Miss Shana?
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:34.680]  I'm from Boston.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.680]  Opposite ends of the country.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.680]  Nice.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:37.680]  Meeting in Colorado.
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:38.680]  Tristan?
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.680]  I'm from Long Beach.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:40.680]  Nice.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:41.680]  That's kind of my neighborhood.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:42.680]  I'm from Bellflower.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:45.680]  I'm from Chicago, but just moved to Phoenix three months ago.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:46.680]  Oh, wow.
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:47.680]  How's that for a change?
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:48.680]  I love it.
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:49.680]  Nice.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:50.680]  You get to ride your bike more?
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:51.680]  Yes.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.680]  Nice.
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.680]  This young lady rides a Harley, and she looks awesome doing it.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:54.680]  Shout out to you and your bike.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:55.680]  Thank you.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:56.680]  All right.
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:58.680]  One of the things that we really ... Big shout out to the dude.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:59.680]  That's hard for me to remember.
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:01.680]  The dude, it's Gatsby Invitational.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:03.680]  That's a lot of words for my stone nest to remember.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:05.680]  Shout out for letting me be a part of that.
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:06.680]  Look, the snow is coming down again.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:07.680]  This is such a great view.
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.680]  Shout out to the people that let us use this house.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.680]  Yeah.
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:11.680]  Yeah, this is a dope house.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:15.680]  One of the things that really made this weekend special, Miss Damsel ... Actually, we're going
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:16.680]  to blame this mostly on Hunt.
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:22.680]  A few months ago, Hunt put me in touch with Miss Damsel, and she asked me if I would breed
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.680]  a strain for her.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:28.680]  A lot of what's been going on this weekend is we have all been smoking what will become
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:32.680]  or possibly not become from what the talk has been, some things that may become Damsel's
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:33.680]  dink.
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.680]  You've got a little notebook in front of you.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:39.680]  Have you guys decided which is your favorite and least favorites in such?
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.680]  I mean, I think the overwhelming favorite is what, ladies?
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.680]  The B4.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:45.680]  B4, okay.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:46.680]  All right, can you describe ...
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:47.680]  It's like an echo in the room.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:48.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:49.680]  All right, so B4 is the winner.
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:53.680]  I've always had ... Judging competitions and being a part of a lot of different stuff,
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:57.680]  I mean, obviously putting you all together is great stuff for us to all flavor.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.680]  I have a veteran rule in doing this, but the one that's gone first is always the winner.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:03.680]  True.
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:04.680]  The one that everybody smoked up.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:05.680]  B4 was gone first.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:07.680]  B4 was gone first this time at the house.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:08.680]  Nice.
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:09.680]  I've got some more B4 in the car.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:11.680]  I'll have to throw some on the counter before I leave.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.680]  Yes, please.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:16.680]  All right, so for the people that didn't get a chance to smoke it, can you describe what
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:19.680]  you thought of B4 since you've got your notes right in front of you?
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:25.680]  Yeah, so I thought it smelled a little bit like pineapple with a hint of citrus, but
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:30.680]  the taste was a little bit more ... I was so high when I did this.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:32.680]  I drew a campfire.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.680]  There's a campfire.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:34.680]  I can see it on our page, guys.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:38.680]  I said it was a little bit floral with a hint of birch and that it was nature-y.
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:41.680]  I said it kind of tasted like camping.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:42.680]  Okay.
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:47.680]  It had some nice orange hairs.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.680]  It was frosty.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:53.680]  Yeah, we have been really enjoying it.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:56.680]  There's been lots of giggles, lots of good times.
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:58.680]  The bitches love B4.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:27:59.680]  The bitches.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.680]  I'm going to call you guys the bitches for the length of the show and I'll stop right
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:03.680]  after.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:04.680]  Oh, I got to look.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:05.680]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.680]  I think you have to have tits to use that word.
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:10.680]  I asked and I got totally denied.
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.680]  I have found my boundary.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.680]  You need to smoke more B4.
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.680]  You got to smoke more B4.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.680]  Yeah.
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.680]  All right, so did anybody else in the room get a campfire or it tastes like camping aroma?
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:21.680]  I'm just curious about that.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:22.680]  Totally.
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:23.680]  Totally.
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:24.680]  All right.
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:25.680]  I mentioned it.
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:26.680]  She's kind of a chef.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.680]  For sure.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.680]  Aren't you a chef?
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:29.680]  This is the first time you haven't been cooking.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:31.680]  Yeah, I'm taking a break.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:32.680]  You're taking a break.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:33.680]  Well, thank you.
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:34.680]  I appreciate it.
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:35.680]  And you say it does kind of taste like campfire.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:36.680]  It does.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:37.680]  In a good way?
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:38.680]  Yes.
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.680]  Okay.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:40.680]  All right.
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:41.680]  Because when I think of campfire, I think like when you go camping and your hair smells
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:42.680]  like campfire.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.680]  Not like that.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.680]  It's just because everything stays in your hair.
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:46.680]  Yeah.
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:47.680]  Hey, what kind of dreadlock joke is that, mama?
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:49.680]  Grab a mic if you're going to talk.
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:50.680]  I'm so sorry.
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:51.680]  We heard you.
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.680]  They're loud enough to where they kind of got you, but it hurt you.
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:55.680]  All right, so B4.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:56.680]  Was there a runner up?
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:00.680]  Yeah, I also really enjoyed the A3.
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:01.680]  A3, all right.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:10.680]  Which I thought it smelled like fruity pebbles, a little bit like black cherry, but it tasted
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.680]  a little more diesel-y.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.680]  But that one had super sparkly derps on it.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:23.680]  And I described the overall high as sway feels, you know, when you like get super high and
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:26.680]  you just like start swaying in the kitchen.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.680]  Nice.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:28.680]  Just kind of leaning?
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:29.680]  Yeah, just kind of leaning to the music.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:30.680]  Can't pick which way your feet want to go?
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:31.680]  All right.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:32.680]  This sways.
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.680]  All right.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:34.680]  So does anybody want to know what was in these crosses?
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:35.680]  I know all the boys in the room are staring at me.
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:36.680]  They're going to tell me what's in there.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:37.680]  We have been waiting.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:38.680]  Yeah, this was fun to mess with everybody.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:39.680]  Did anybody try any of the number, the letter C?
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:40.680]  Did any of that get tasted?
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:41.680]  Was that dookie?
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:42.680]  Can we all agree that was just dookie and I shouldn't grow that anymore?
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.680]  Okay.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.680]  But we just didn't even write anything down for it.
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.680]  Yeah, it was no good.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.680]  Yeah, that's why.
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.680]  There were three letters.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.800]  that were from that selection and I didn't bring them.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.800]  So the way I did this, I ran, I think I started with 20 seeds of three different strains and
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:50.800]  I narrowed it down through the veg phase and through flour.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:51.800]  I ended up with three of letter A.
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:52.800]  And I just labeled the seeds so that nobody knew what they were.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:53.800]  I was just, this is brand A, this is brand B, this is brand C.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:54.800]  I had three of letter A, four of B and three of C.
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:55.800]  C's are dookie.
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:56.800]  I just got rid of them.
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:57.800]  Which are what?
[01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:58.800]  C's are dookie, C's are dookie.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:29:59.800]  I just got rid of them.
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:00.800]  Which are what?
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:01.800]  C's are dookie, C's are dookie.
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:02.800]  I'm just getting rid of the C's.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:03.800]  Which are what?
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:08.880]  down through the veg phase and through flour, I ended up with three of letter A, and I just
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:11.760]  labeled the seeds so that nobody knew what they were. I was just, this is brand A, this
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:16.720]  is brand B, this is brand C. I had three of letter A, four of B, and three of C. C's are
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:19.640]  dookie. Just got rid of them. We don't need that. It's crap. I'm not even going to grow
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:27.200]  any more of those seeds. Throw it all away. C was Transformer to Daybreaker from Gay Green
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:36.040]  Genetics. Transformer is Inferno Haze and Chem D. What's the other one I said it is?
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:40.640]  Sorry, I'm lost now. Chem D, it's Inferno Haze and Daybreaker. Daybreaker is Chem D
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:46.400]  and Joseph OG. All right. Yeah. So many genetics in my head that I get confused, but the winners
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.400]  are-
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.400]  Terp nerd.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:52.560]  I am kind of a terp nerd. I'll take that. A is Space Queen crossed a Grateful Dog. I
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:57.000]  used a female Space Queen and a male, a reversed male Grateful Dog. So it's a feminized seed,
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:58.800]  but A3?
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:02.280]  Yeah. Space Queen to Grateful Dog is what that is. So it's my Grateful Dog that I made
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:06.880]  to sub cool Space Queen. A real tall, stretchy phenotype of the Space Queen. That's where
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:10.840]  that fruity, funky, moldy smell comes from is the Space Queen. And it's the Romulan that
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:17.000]  makes it grow those real orange pistils, the real fingery calyxes. That's from Romulan.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.960]  So B, the one that everybody loves, everybody's guessed it so many times accurately. It's
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:26.120]  Lemon Skunk from Arian. It's Greenhouse Seeds, Lemon Skunk. It's Arians from Lemon Man. And
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:31.560]  then it's crossed to the Daybreaker from Gage Green Genetics with the Joseph OG and the
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:36.880]  Kim D in there. So that's what that one is. Lemon Skunk and Daybreaker. It needs a good
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:43.240]  name if it's... So what I've heard, you might not decide that this is going to be the keeper.
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:50.080]  They were all super, super good, but I feel like there's just another strain that I compare
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:52.640]  all of my highs to and-
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.640]  Don't say the name of it because we're going to keep that secret and do this all over again.
[01:31:55.880 --> 01:32:00.560]  So I think we should try to put that in the mix and maybe do the process over. But I mean,
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:05.200]  there were so many good... What was the B1? That was another really, really good one.
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:09.080]  That's the Lemon Skunk Daybreaker cross. So all of the Bs will be Lemon Skunk to Daybreaker
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:14.040]  and all of the As are Grateful Dog and Space Queen. And all the Cs were trash. So the ones
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:17.120]  that you guys really liked, we're going to work on getting those on the shelf at Green
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.000]  and Healthy Wellness. It'll take a while.
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:22.440]  Yeah, that's the A3.
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.840]  A3, we'll get that there.
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:24.840]  And the B4, I believe.
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:25.840]  And B4, maybe even B1.
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.840]  B1 was super good.
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:27.840]  I really liked B1.
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:28.840]  Yeah.
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.840]  Yeah. I mean, the Phenos all came out fantastic.
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:34.520]  The Terpy Boys are across the room. And when I said B1, I got two thumbs ups on the B1.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.600]  So there'll be some new stuff showing up at Green and Healthy Wellness, you guys. That'll
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.080]  be a little bit, be a couple of harvests, but we'll make it happen.
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:43.880]  I mean, it all got smoked, so I think it's fine.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:44.880]  It's back week.
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:45.880]  It's all great.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:46.880]  It's great, yeah.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:47.880]  And kudos to you, brother. Thank you.
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:48.880]  Well, thanks. Thank you for some nice-
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:49.880]  I'm so happy.
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:50.880]  I'm so happy.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:51.880]  I'm so happy.
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:52.880]  I aspire to smoke for the event.
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:53.880]  We appreciate it.
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:54.880]  We appreciate all that.
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:55.960]  I've watched all these ladies be really high, but when they don't smoke like the Colorado
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:33:00.120]  folk do, they come and get wrecked, and it's pretty entertaining. I'm making fun of you.
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.120]  I love it.
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.120]  I love it.
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:06.440]  And then the Terpy Boys have just been smoking all the B1 and B4 like champions. What'd you
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:07.440]  write? What are your notes?
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:10.920]  Okay, so Jacqueline over here, she did her own-
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:15.960]  Don't they call you dimples? Or is it damples?
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:16.960]  She's getting so shy. It's hilarious.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:20.040]  Jacqueline did her own notes for the B4.
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:21.040]  That was when we smoked at-
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:28.040]  Yeah, she was already really high, and I was like, write down how you feel. And just for
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:35.040]  appearance, she wrote green. Potency, she wrote good. Taste, she wrote tasty.
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:36.040]  Creative.
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:42.720]  We were just giggling at her notes.
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:46.160]  She's all blushing. That's cute. I like it. I have more notes that we could go over, unless
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.280]  anybody has more stuff to say about this weed.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:56.680]  So talk to us about what's up with that pheno. How long is B4? How high does it get? What
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:57.680]  does it yield?
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:02.240]  So B1 and B, all of the Bs were very, very similar in growth. You could barely see a
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:05.400]  difference in them. They kind of stretch. The lemon skunk makes them stretch pretty
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:10.720]  well. They grow real dense. They grow real chunky. They could take 70 days. These went
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:13.840]  63. I think it could have gone another week, but I was pressed for time.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.840]  What about the A?
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:20.120]  The A was done at eight weeks. Finished at eight weeks. One of them started to herm.
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.040]  You could probably see it if you guys are experienced weed growers. And if you got one
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.040]  of the top buds, you could see herm flowers in there. It was just starting.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:27.040]  The banana bud, man.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:31.200]  Yeah, man. So I can't work. I don't remember which one it is. I took pictures and marked
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:34.720]  it down in the photos and stuff, but I don't remember off the top of my head. But I marked
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:36.840]  down which one was a herm. That'll have to go.
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.780]  Which one brought in the most?
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:39.780]  The most flower? B1.
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:40.780]  Well played.
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:44.980]  B1 brought in just, yeah, there was most of them. They're little plants. They harvested
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:47.460]  about an ounce and a half. B1 was about two and a half ounces.
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:48.460]  Bless.
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:49.460]  Yeah. Yeah. So B1's a keeper.
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:50.460]  C9.
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:55.340]  Yes, I. We got another Rasta on the microphone. That's always nice. Yeah. So you know what
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:59.340]  your favorite strain is basically, Damsel. You figured that out. We're going to cross
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:04.020]  something of mine to that strain. Some of our friends in the room actually have a clone
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:08.380]  of your favorite strain. They've given me blessings to work with that. So I'm going
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:11.580]  to play with it and we're going to make you a new strain and we'll do this all over again.
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:12.580]  When are you ladies coming back?
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:13.580]  Soon, I hope.
[01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:14.580]  All right.
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:15.580]  Yeah, everybody's.
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:19.580]  You got to give me. This is going to take me, let's see, 120. Give me about a year.
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:22.940]  Honest. I'm not even shitting. Like, because I know what I want to do. I need to get the
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:26.980]  clone that you want me to work with and then I'm going to reverse it. I'm going to make
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:30.420]  it a boy. It's a girl. I'm going to turn it into a boy. I'm going to collect pollen from
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:34.180]  it and I'm going to put pollen on another clone of the same plant. And then I'm also
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:37.700]  put pollen on like nine other bitches in the room. And then we're going to smoke all. We're
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:41.900]  going to grow those out and we'll smoke a bunch of those. We'll do this all over again.
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:46.780]  That sounds like three harvests pretty much. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Four. What the fuck? It's
[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:50.580]  going to be a minute. Plus I'm curing. Yeah. And we're going to have a whole bunch of stuff
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:54.780]  growing. You can't rush perfection. That is the truth. And we want to find your strangest
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:55.780]  for you.
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:56.780]  I appreciate that, man.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:59.780]  What are we smoking right now? Which one is this microphone?
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:00.780]  B9.
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:04.780]  B9. Okay. It's got a cotton candy.
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:05.860]  It's got a cotton candy.
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:07.860]  It's like musky. It's very sweet.
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:12.660]  That's the Daybreaker that gives it the musky. Daybreaker's got some real OG Kush influence
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:17.060]  to it. Shout out to Gage Green Genetics. I feel it's real important to give a shout outs
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:21.460]  to the people that let me breed with their strains. Gage completely encourages me to
[01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:24.980]  work with his stuff. So thanks dude. The whole Gage Green Genetics crew. It's not just one
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:28.140]  person. It's a group of people. So have you guys ever done a tasting party or anything
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:29.140]  like this before?
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:30.140]  No.
[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:33.620]  All the girls said no. All the ladies said no. How about you guys over there? Tasting
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:35.060]  party. You ever done something like this?
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:36.060]  Yeah.
[01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:39.180]  Nice. Well, thanks for being involved with it. Hunt, fist bump for putting me in this
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:40.180]  position. That is awesome.
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:41.180]  What's up?
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:44.900]  All right. So we've revealed the winner. I told you what everything is. We're going to
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:51.260]  do it again. Yeah. All right. So I wrote this down. Hey, Miss Amanda, I see you got your
[01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:57.260]  phone over there. You've got a book coming out. A cookbook. You talked about it. You
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:37:02.060]  want me to just cut that part out? I was going to give you a chance to shout out your cookbook.
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:07.620]  I am finishing a cookbook that I've been inspired by this trip to quickly finish by
[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:11.900]  the first of January. So stay tuned.
[01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:12.900]  What's your cookbook called?
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:14.620]  It's going to be called Eat Yourself Thin.
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:16.380]  And you said it's mostly for women?
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:25.420]  It's going to be for everybody. I think that everyone should know how to cook clean and
[01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:31.340]  simple and on a budget. So that's how it's going to be. So whether you cook for your
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:37.260]  boyfriend or girlfriend or significant other, husband, wife, it's for those people.
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:42.100]  Awesome. So you'll have it finished by the end of the year. And then how long to get
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:43.100]  it out?
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:44.100]  Oh.
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:48.220]  We'll do a Skype interview when it comes out because you've cooked for the house and I
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:49.220]  ate some of the leftovers last night.
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:50.220]  Yeah, it's been amazing.
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:54.220]  And I drove home like a satisfied man. I was like, that was some good food. So thank you.
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:55.220]  Well, thank you.
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:56.860]  That was awesome. I had to make sure to shout out your book.
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:57.860]  Thank you.
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:06.380]  So catered to like vegetarians, soy allergies, dairy allergies, gluten allergies. I mean,
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:12.660]  we have about five different food allergies in this house and she's managed to cater to
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:13.900]  every single one of them.
[01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:17.620]  Normally, I won't eat at somebody else's house. But when she was talking to Hunt about his
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:21.380]  gluten allergy and she said, there's no egg in this and this, I was like, this lady knows
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:23.820]  what's up. So I totally trusted eating her food.
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:24.820]  It's been amazing.
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:26.300]  Yeah. Good job. Thanks for feeding everybody.
[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:27.820]  Thank you. It was super fun.
[01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:31.220]  Nice. I can tell you just live in the kitchen. You're just comfortable in there.
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:32.220]  Pretty much.
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:35.940]  Yeah. It's awesome. I love it. So Brent, what do you do when you're not being a supermodel?
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:39.500]  Not a supermodel. I meant a super model. But you know what I mean.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:48.900]  Thank you. I am the general manager for Green and Healthy Wellness. So I, you know, keep
[01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:49.900]  a...
[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:50.900]  You manage?
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:51.900]  Yeah, I manage. I...
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:52.900]  And you help in the garden.
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:56.780]  I take care of the day to day. I recently started helping out in the garden. I have
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:39:01.980]  a new appreciation for the plant that I've been smoking for the past 10 years because
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:04.020]  it is a lot of work to make.
[01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:05.020]  You get a little sweaty in there?
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:09.380]  A little bit of sweaty. Got my hair caught in...
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:10.740]  Oh, that's the worst. Yeah.
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:17.580]  Some sticky fly traps and, you know, sore back and sliced fingers.
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:20.580]  All the dudes with shaved heads are laughing at you.
[01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:25.700]  It wasn't battle wounds. It was like straight up like there's something about Mary's status,
[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:26.700]  like my bangs just like up in the front.
[01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:27.700]  She had some goo in there. It's pretty gross.
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:34.300]  It was gross. But so yeah, it was a really humbling experience and a really good experience.
[01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:41.260]  I've enjoyed it. But I really enjoy interacting with the patients most and, you know, getting
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:46.820]  to develop relationships with them and building that trust. So that's definitely where I think...
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:53.580]  Oh, God. How long have I been in customer service now? How old am I? 13 years of customer
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:40:00.020]  service experience probably serves me well in the front of the house. But so I do that
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:08.020]  and I'm married and I have a dog and we like to stay home and smoke weed and...
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:09.020]  Shout out to Puggle.
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:11.020]  Watch Netflix. Yeah. Shout out to Penelope and Puggle.
[01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:15.300]  Make sure you follow her on Instagram, the sweetest dog on IG.
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:27.300]  She's such a diva. So yeah, it's been, you know, I just I live the weed and Colorado lifestyle and I've been here since April.
[01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:32.300]  So I'm just enjoying the altitude and the mountains and...
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:33.300]  Welcome home.
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:34.300]  Thank you.
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:39.300]  This view here is awesome. It's snowing so perfectly. I like it. You guys found the greatest spot.
[01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:44.300]  I'm glad we did a podcast right here. All right. Miss Shana, can I ask you what you do in your normal everyday life
[01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:46.300]  when you're not being a model?
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.300]  Photographer.
[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:49.300]  Yeah, I'm a photographer.
[01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:51.300]  I mean, she's babely enough to be a model for sure.
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:54.300]  Why aren't you a model, bro? Let's hear why you aren't the model. I want to know.
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:55.300]  I think it's silly.
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:56.300]  She retired.
[01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:58.300]  Yeah, you retired? You were a model?
[01:40:58.300 --> 01:40:59.300]  Yeah, she retired.
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:00.300]  But not anymore?
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:01.300]  Yeah, she's the artiste.
[01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:02.300]  All right.
[01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:03.300]  Yeah.
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:08.300]  Okay. So I bet it's much easier for you ladies to pose and feel comfortable in front of a lady photographer instead of some creepy dude.
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:09.300]  It's so much easier.
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:10.300]  Absolutely.
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:11.300]  Yeah.
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:12.300]  We love shooting with Shana.
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:13.300]  I can tell.
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:24.300]  With her past experience, she really, you know, shoots each photo to the model's body and she's really good at directing and, yeah, we love working with her.
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:31.300]  We were – I'm so stoked about all of the shots that we got from this weekend and we're real stoked to put out the look book because Shana killed it.
[01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:35.300]  I saw the unedited shots and the lighting is great. You made these ladies look great. Good job.
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:39.300]  Thanks, guys, for providing me with the stuff I needed.
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:41.300]  Yeah, girl.
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:43.300]  They make it look so easy.
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:44.300]  Miss Tristan.
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:45.300]  Hello.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:47.300]  Wow. Hi there.
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:51.300]  It sounds like we're going to do some weird phone shoots.
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:52.300]  I'm game.
[01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:54.300]  What do you normally do in your normal life?
[01:41:54.300 --> 01:42:01.300]  Normal life? I'm a bartender at night and during the day I hang out with my dog a lot, smoke a bunch of weed, watch some Netflix and chill.
[01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:02.300]  Perfect.
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:03.300]  Yes.
[01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:05.300]  All right, Miss Shy Girl, I'm going to ask you next.
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:07.300]  What do you do in your normal day-to-day life?
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:10.300]  I'm a battle service girl on the weekends.
[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:11.300]  Where do you do that?
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:14.300]  This bar called Barsmith and Monarch Theater.
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:16.300]  Oh, no. People are going to stalk you. I might cut that out.
[01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:19.300]  No, I post on Instagram. I have to post about it, too.
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:20.300]  Okay. Cool.
[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:24.300]  So that's about it. And then I ride my bike and I hike.
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:26.300]  Your motorcycle? Your Harley?
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:27.300]  Yes.
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.300]  Tell us a little bit about the Harley. I'm curious.
[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:36.300]  It's a 2010 1200 Nightster. It's my first bike and I've had it for just about a month now.
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:37.300]  Nice. It looks good on you.
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:38.300]  Thanks.
[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:39.300]  It looks great on you.
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:41.300]  Thanks for not being shy for a minute.
[01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:43.300]  Oh, she passed the mic so quickly.
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:46.300]  You pulled it off. You nailed it, though. You nailed it. That was perfect.
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:49.300]  Hey, Hunt. What do you do in your normal life, brother?
[01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:52.300]  What doesn't he do?
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:55.300]  Besides getting his car stolen?
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:57.300]  Yeah, I don't really have a normal life.
[01:42:57.300 --> 01:42:59.300]  Shout out to the people that stole your car.
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:02.300]  Yeah, my car got stolen yesterday morning.
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:04.300]  Can we talk about the irony of this?
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:05.300]  Yeah.
[01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:06.300]  Can we just mention this irony?
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:17.300]  You are more than welcome to bring up the fact that I got paid to be a car thief model for the Department of Police and DMV about identity theft and getting your car stolen.
[01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:24.300]  And that was on every Red Rock ticket and every DMV department banner for like a year or so.
[01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:29.300]  So how many Facebook and Instagram and text messages did you get when your car got stolen?
[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:40.300]  Yeah, so like 5 o'clock in the morning I started my car or whatever and these guys got it while I was coming out the front door and I chased them and all this other shit that occurred.
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:44.300]  And then three or four hours later we got our car back.
[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:47.300]  So that was a...
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:48.300]  Double mic in him.
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:50.300]  Oh, I'm switching mics on the phone.
[01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:51.300]  We've got a mic.
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:52.300]  So sorry.
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:53.300]  No, you're good.
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.300]  So got the car back and all this stuff.
[01:43:55.300 --> 01:44:10.300]  I think the day yesterday, yeah, no two days ago, whenever it happened on Thursday, I think I got about 15 to 20 text messages of some sort of image of myself as a car thief saying that your car was easy to steal and taking your identity was even easier.
[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:18.300]  And there's one that's like a really big close up with me and it just says like, you know, something about me taking your ID or some shit.
[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:22.300]  I'm mad at myself for not making the first meme of that situation.
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:26.300]  Oh, that's all credit to dad back there.
[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:28.300]  Yeah, that was the Terpy Boys coming through.
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:30.300]  The Terpy Boys pointing over here to Amanda.
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:31.300]  So that's a 50.
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:32.300]  I heard you guys complimenting each other yesterday.
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:33.300]  It's a 50-50.
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:34.300]  Came in with the assist.
[01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:35.300]  Yeah, it was a team effort.
[01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:37.300]  Yeah, that all happened yesterday.
[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:39.300]  I don't really have much of a regular life, I don't think.
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:48.300]  I mean, I have like, my real life is like, you know, Grimey Gatsby in four pieces and green, healthy wellness and the growth that, you know, you and I work at and...
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:49.300]  Dude, you crush it in there.
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:50.300]  You know what you're doing.
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:51.300]  When you hired me, you're like, I don't know how to grow weed.
[01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:52.300]  I need you.
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:53.300]  Bro, you got it under control.
[01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:56.300]  I shouldn't tell you that too much because I mean, I'd be out of a job, but you got it under control, bro.
[01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:57.300]  You know what you're doing.
[01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:58.300]  We do an alright job over there.
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:00.300]  We try to keep the Terps coming.
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:01.300]  You look like you know how to grow weed.
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:02.300]  Yeah, I don't know about a real life yet.
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:09.300]  I think I get, I sleep from like 11 or 12 until like five in the morning and the rest of the time, as you all know, my phone's on and we're going.
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:12.300]  You guys, there's a bed at the shop, if that tells you anything about life.
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:14.300]  There's a bed at our shop where we grow.
[01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:15.300]  Yeah, I've slept in it already.
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:18.300]  I've only worked there for less than a month and I've crashed out in that bed.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:19.300]  Yeah, I can't, I can't.
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:21.300]  Yeah, you got to, you got to grind as hard as you can.
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:23.300]  You got to do what you got to do to win it.
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:26.300]  Yeah, we have a, we have a mattress that I grow in case that's necessary.
[01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:27.300]  Nice.
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:28.300]  All right.
[01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:29.300]  So I feel like we've gone about 30 minutes.
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:32.300]  Most people listen for about 35 minutes before they get burned out.
[01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:35.300]  I'll put a little intro and an ending at the end of this show at the start and end.
[01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:39.300]  Do you ladies have anything you want to say since you got a microphone in your hand and a chance to say something to the world?
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:40.300]  Do it.
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:41.300]  Give it in her mouth right there.
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:42.300]  Free the nipple.
[01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:43.300]  Free the nipple.
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:44.300]  All right.
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:45.300]  All right.
[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:46.300]  Right.
[01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:47.300]  Can we talk about your little crew?
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:48.300]  We all agree.
[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:51.300]  Can we talk about your crew, like your gang, the WPC?
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:52.300]  Did we mention that?
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:55.300]  I got a bunch of yaas.
[01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:56.300]  All right.
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:46:01.300]  That's kind of a secret, but use your own imagination for what you think WPC could stand for.
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:03.300]  Yep, that's all we get out of them, guys.
[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:05.300]  Well, ladies, thanks for letting me invade your privacy for a few minutes.
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:07.300]  I really appreciate you being on the show.
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:11.300]  Britt, thanks for giving me the honor of being the dude selected to create a stream for you.
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:12.300]  Yes, thank you for all your hard work.
[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:13.300]  Oh, I appreciate that.
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:15.300]  Can't wait for us to find the winner.
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:16.300]  Yeah, we're close, you guys.
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:19.300]  And Team Green and Healthy, thanks for letting me be a part of that, you guys.
[01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:20.300]  That's awesome.
[01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:21.300]  I'm honored.
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:22.300]  Definitely, yeah.
[01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:26.300]  Come down to West 430 Colorado Avenue and buy a bunch of turps and hang out and kick it
[01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:27.300]  and see the new shop.
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:33.300]  And soon, in like February or something, I think we'll have Weed by Jeff on the shelf, too.
[01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:36.300]  Yeah, about February, March-ish, there'll be ganja grown by Ross and Jeff.
[01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:38.300]  You guys can always come meet Miss Damsel.
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:39.300]  She's there a lot.
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:40.300]  Come meet Damsel.
[01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:41.300]  It's 430 West Colorado.
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:42.300]  We'd love to see you.
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:44.300]  Yeah.
[01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:45.300]  Go say hi to Haley, also.
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:47.300]  Oh, it's medical only.
[01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.300]  I'm so sorry.
[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:51.300]  All of you people that are not patients.
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:55.300]  But, you know, we'll expand soon and we'll see you there.
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:57.300]  It's coming, you guys.
[01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:00.300]  Colorado Springs has to wake up and let us do recreational cannabis.
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:01.300]  This is not cool.
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:02.300]  Smoke turps.
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:03.300]  Smoke turps.
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:04.300]  Turps up, piggies out.
[01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:05.300]  Uh-oh, that's starting.
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:06.300]  Keep it true.
[01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:08.300]  All right, well, since that's starting, we're going to wrap up this one and we're going
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:11.300]  to start a show with the Turpy Boys over there because Hunt's throwing the vibe now.

[01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:28.390]  That's right.
[01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:32.390]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:36.390]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:39.390]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.

[01:57:49.390 --> 01:57:53.390]  Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:55.390]  I'm going to turn down that music a little bit.
[01:57:55.390 --> 01:57:58.390]  Make sure you guys support my friends in the Mystic Roots band, you guys.
[01:57:58.390 --> 01:58:01.390]  I hope everybody's having a great holiday season.
[01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:02.390]  This will be the Christmas episode.
[01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:04.390]  I hope you've got all your Christmas shopping done.
[01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:08.390]  Maybe you're listening to this while you're driving to the mall to grab that last-minute gift or whatever you got to do.
[01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:12.390]  Anyway, no matter what holiday you're celebrating this season, I hope you have a great holiday.
[01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:15.390]  I hope you're surrounded by friends and family and some good food.
[01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:18.390]  Most importantly, I hope you're surrounded by some good Terp.
[01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:21.390]  So if you've got a fat joint, I hope you've got a good dad, maybe some edibles.
[01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:23.390]  You know how we do it here at the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:27.390]  I hope you are getting baked out of your mind this holiday season.
[01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:31.390]  You guys, this episode is part two of the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational.

[01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:57.390]  When I'm shopping for a rig, I like to know that what I'm paying for is going to give me a nice fat dab.
[01:58:57.390 --> 01:58:59.390]  And I know that I can rely on Hitman Glass.
[01:58:59.390 --> 01:59:04.390]  Don't trust your dab to a rig made in China by a Chinese child without proper eye protection or adequate pay, you guys.
[01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:08.390]  Buy Glass, made in America, by folks who dab just as hard as you and I.

[01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:33.390]  It's one of my favorite rigs.
[01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:34.390]  It's got a nice tall can.
[01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:36.390]  It's got a nice wide mouthpiece on it.
[01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:38.390]  It gives me big fat rips.
[01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:39.390]  I've got it hooked up to the e-nail.
[01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:44.390]  So I'm going to let the music play for a couple of seconds and I'm going to take a couple of fat dabs.
[01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:53.390]  And when I come back, I will be joined on the microphone by the Terpex crew and the Clear Concentrate crew from the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational.
[01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:55.390]  So let's take a dab and I will be right back.
[01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:02.860]  All right, guys. I actually hit record, so behave yourselves for just a couple of seconds.
[02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:03.860]  All right, guys, we're back.
[02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:06.860]  We're here at the house at the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational.
[02:00:06.860 --> 02:00:08.860]  This will be round two.
[02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:10.860]  This time it's more of the bros.
[02:00:10.860 --> 02:00:15.860]  The ladies have gone downstairs to quote unquote take shots, bitches, is what I think I heard was going to happen down there.
[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:17.860]  So I hope they're taking a shot.
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:20.860]  They're going to take like two shots between the five of them.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:24.860]  Between the five of them, there's like probably 300 pounds of people down there.
[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:25.860]  Yeah.
[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:26.860]  All right.
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:30.860]  So sitting to the left, Mr. Cocker Daniel on Instagram.
[02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:33.860]  If you want to stalk him, it's Cocker underscore Daniel.
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:37.860]  I'd known you first from CCC420 is where I think I first discovered you.
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:38.860]  Yes.
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:39.860]  Yes.
[02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:41.860]  I hear you're coming back on the CCC420, the triple C420.
[02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:44.860]  I hear you're coming back, making a remergence.
[02:00:44.860 --> 02:00:45.860]  We actually are.
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:46.860]  Yeah, we're shooting for January.
[02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:48.860]  I actually forgot about that.
[02:00:48.860 --> 02:00:49.860]  You forgot about it?
[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:51.860]  I didn't forget about it, but it's.
[02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:53.860]  He was a little bit distracted the last few days.
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:54.860]  Let's just put it that way.
[02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:55.860]  Yeah, I forgot it was something we could bring up.
[02:00:55.860 --> 02:00:56.860]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:00:56.860 --> 02:00:57.860]  There's been some distractions.
[02:00:57.860 --> 02:00:58.860]  Coming back in January.
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:02.860]  Hopefully that'll be another success like the first go around.
[02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:03.860]  Nice.
[02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:04.860]  Well, congrats on coming back.
[02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:06.860]  I hope to see you back on YouTube.
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:07.860]  The YouTube misses you.
[02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:09.860]  All the weed reviews, all the dab reviews.
[02:01:09.860 --> 02:01:10.860]  Yeah.
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:12.860]  You guys getting just too stoned sitting there.
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:15.860]  And since he's over here talking to my right, it's my buddy Jordan.
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:16.860]  How you doing, brother?
[02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:17.860]  I'm doing excellent.
[02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:18.860]  How are you doing, Jeff?
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:19.860]  Dude, I'm dabbed out.
[02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:21.860]  We're hanging out here at this beautiful house in Springs on the top of a mountain.
[02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:24.860]  I can see all of Colorado Springs through the fog.
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:25.860]  It's gorgeous.
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:26.860]  Lovely Colorado Springs.
[02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:27.860]  719.
[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:29.860]  The pearl of Colorado and the Midwest.
[02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:30.860]  It's going to get redonk, you guys.
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:32.860]  So I hope you're prepared for this.
[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:33.860]  It's going to be a very interesting episode.
[02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:35.860]  If you guys want to follow my buddy Jordan,
[02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:40.860]  he is, I remember it, it's GDP Inc. on Instagram.
[02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:41.860]  Granddaddy Purple Incorporated.
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:42.860]  Granddaddy Purple Incorporated.
[02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:44.860]  I don't know why you'd rep that strain.
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:46.860]  That is one of my least favorite strains ever, bro.
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:47.860]  Well, it shows what you know.
[02:01:47.860 --> 02:01:49.860]  These guys asked me for a cut of it today.
[02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:50.860]  That's our favorite.
[02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:52.860]  I love you guys still.
[02:01:52.860 --> 02:01:53.860]  All right.
[02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:54.860]  And over here speaking on the phone, who was on the phone?
[02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:55.860]  Why did I say phone?
[02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:56.860]  That's how high I am.
[02:01:56.860 --> 02:01:59.860]  Over there on the microphone, the guy that I just met last night, he's cool as shit.
[02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:01.860]  This is the guy we call the clear scientist.
[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:02.860]  My buddy Chris.
[02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:03.860]  How you doing, brother?
[02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:04.860]  I'm doing excellent.
[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:05.860]  I am high as shit, dude.
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:06.860]  We're all high.
[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:07.860]  We're all altitude high.
[02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:08.860]  We're medicating high.
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:09.860]  719.
[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:10.860]  It's very excellent.
[02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:11.860]  Well, thanks for joining me on the show.
[02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:14.860]  Here comes a beautiful Ms. Damsel sneaking through.
[02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:15.860]  Nice, nice.
[02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:16.860]  And here's a guy I just met today.
[02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:17.860]  This guy's name's Brian.
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:19.860]  He's got a really fantabulous long name.
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:20.860]  What do they call you, my friend?
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:21.860]  The Mad Alchemist.
[02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:22.860]  The Mad Alchemist.
[02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:26.860]  Do you have an Instagram that you'd like people to stalk you on while they're listening to the show?
[02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:27.860]  No.
[02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:28.860]  No, you're low key.
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:29.860]  All right.
[02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:30.860]  Kind of like a low key kind of dude.
[02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:33.860]  I hear you're into some cool shit, so we may open the doors to talk about some of that.
[02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:35.860]  I do like cool shit.
[02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:36.860]  Nice, nice.
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:42.860]  I hear that you two, Chris and Brian, are like the hash mad scientists.
[02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:44.860]  People say that.
[02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:47.860]  It's kind of just the goods.
[02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:48.860]  I'll go ahead and say that.
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:49.860]  They are, yes.
[02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:54.860]  Can I ask about the product that I heard about a minute ago, the Mother's Milk?
[02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:55.860]  Can I ask you guys about that?
[02:02:55.860 --> 02:02:59.860]  Are you ready to talk about that on a podcast, or is that something we have to keep on the down low?
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:01.860]  We can talk about it.
[02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:04.860]  I'd like to hear about that a little bit.
[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:06.860]  They'll reveal what they can.
[02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:07.860]  Okay.
[02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:08.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:08.860 --> 02:03:10.860]  If I ask too many questions, just tell me I'm out of line.
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:12.860]  It's really mostly this guy.
[02:03:12.860 --> 02:03:13.860]  It's just Brian.
[02:03:13.860 --> 02:03:16.860]  It's a water-soluble hash oil solution.
[02:03:16.860 --> 02:03:26.860]  You make the solution, so you say, oh, this has got five or ten milligrams per milliliter of solution.
[02:03:26.860 --> 02:03:34.860]  You're going to have a little test tube or some volumetric flask or something and measure out exactly how many milligrams you're going to want to get.
[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:36.860]  It's potent, and it works.
[02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:38.860]  It lasts.
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:39.860]  I want to try it.
[02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:41.860]  Yes, we all want to try some of that.
[02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:45.860]  Hunt likes the Dr. Pepper mix.
[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:48.860]  I was just going to say I would like to drop some in my Dr. Pepper.
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:50.860]  I hear it hits you within like 15 minutes.
[02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:51.860]  It does, or sooner.
[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:53.860]  Yeah, it's definitely the 24th flavor in there for sure.
[02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:55.860]  The 24th flavor in my Dr. Pepper.
[02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:57.860]  How long does it last like a normal edible?
[02:03:57.860 --> 02:03:59.860]  Consensus.
[02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:01.860]  If you can stay awake long enough.
[02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:02.860]  If you can stay awake.
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:03.860]  Compare the two.
[02:04:03.860 --> 02:04:04.860]  All right.
[02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:06.860]  If you take enough, it lasts a really long time.
[02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:08.860]  Hunt, would you like to testify on this matter?
[02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:09.860]  Mother's milk?
[02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:11.860]  We're going to bring to the mic our buddy Hunt the Grimy Gatsby.
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:12.860]  He's hanging out in the room.
[02:04:12.860 --> 02:04:14.860]  Tell us a little bit about what happens when you have consumed the mother's milk.
[02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:16.860]  How do you like this stuff?
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:18.860]  It is a—
[02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:20.860]  Straight from the teat.
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:29.860]  It is a smokeless, immediate type of effect where literally after three or four sips or a couple straws worth,
[02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:31.860]  you can feel it.
[02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:38.860]  If the drink is potent enough, within five to 10 minutes, you're at pretty much euphoria.
[02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:46.860]  It also compounds itself or some sort of multiplier where it's like if there's 60 milligrams in the cup,
[02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:51.860]  it literally feels like 200 milligrams when you drink it.
[02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:56.860]  And some batches in the R&D phase were extremely terpy and unpleasant,
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:00.860]  and other batches have been refined into perfection.
[02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:02.860]  Very nice.
[02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:03.860]  Very nice.
[02:05:03.860 --> 02:05:04.860]  Well, thanks for your testimony, kind sir.
[02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:06.860]  If you ever want to grab a mic, just jump in, dude.
[02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:07.860]  I know you're hanging out over there.
[02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:08.860]  Enjoy yourself.
[02:05:08.860 --> 02:05:09.860]  Squad up.
[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:10.860]  Nice.
[02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:13.860]  So I guess the golden question is do you bring any of this shit, bro?
[02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:15.860]  No, I failed on that front, man.
[02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:16.860]  I'm sorry.
[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:17.860]  I'm sorry.
[02:05:17.860 --> 02:05:22.860]  I've got over an hour drive home, and it's snowing, and it's going to be a bobsled ride getting down this mountain where we are.
[02:05:22.860 --> 02:05:25.860]  This place is beautiful, but getting down tonight in the dark.
[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:26.860]  Dude, how about the deer?
[02:05:26.860 --> 02:05:28.860]  Anybody else experience the deer?
[02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:30.860]  Yes, we did experience the deer.
[02:05:30.860 --> 02:05:32.860]  That was some crazy shit.
[02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:39.860]  I grew up in Ohio, lived in Colorado here for a couple years, and when we lived down here in Colorado Springs,
[02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:43.860]  I mean I always knew the deers to be pretty damn friendly and fearless,
[02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:51.860]  but this motherfucker was trying to get in on the cypher or some shit because he backed down like eight of us.
[02:05:51.860 --> 02:05:53.860]  We're sitting around smoking in a circle.
[02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:57.860]  This fool came over, startled us, and slowly walked back to the house.
[02:05:57.860 --> 02:05:59.860]  He just like literally backed us into a corner.
[02:05:59.860 --> 02:06:00.860]  Into the door.
[02:06:00.860 --> 02:06:01.860]  We pulled up into the driveway.
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:05.860]  He stopped in front of the cars and looked at us like, you got the pass or what?
[02:06:05.860 --> 02:06:07.860]  And then he came up to my window like 10 bucks.
[02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:08.860]  He'd look at me in the eye.
[02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:09.860]  He'd look at my joint.
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:10.860]  Yeah, yeah, that dude was serious.
[02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:11.860]  He looked at me in the eye again.
[02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:12.860]  I dropped the joint.
[02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:18.860]  At one point I bent down to put the blunt out.
[02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:20.860]  Yeah, that's what you bent over for, right?
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:21.860]  He got in charge.
[02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:24.860]  He got ready to charge though.
[02:06:24.860 --> 02:06:25.860]  He was ready.
[02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:27.860]  He was like a four-point, nice four-point, right?
[02:06:27.860 --> 02:06:29.860]  I think he was like an eight-point, man.
[02:06:29.860 --> 02:06:30.860]  He was big.
[02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:31.860]  He was a big boy.
[02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:32.860]  Chris, what was he?
[02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:33.860]  He was an eight-pointer.
[02:06:33.860 --> 02:06:35.860]  He was an eight-point buck, man.
[02:06:35.860 --> 02:06:36.860]  I'll tell you what.
[02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:38.860]  I thought about wrangling him myself.
[02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:42.860]  I said Chris was going to give him a grapple, but who said that?
[02:06:42.860 --> 02:06:44.860]  I was like, Chris, tornado him.
[02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:46.860]  I need my camo on.
[02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:47.860]  He said he wanted to grab by the horns.
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:48.860]  One of you guys was serious about it.
[02:06:48.860 --> 02:06:49.860]  I'm going to get him by the horns.
[02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:50.860]  I'm going to wrassle him.
[02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:51.860]  Yeah.
[02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:52.860]  Wrastle him.
[02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:53.860]  I'd have loved to have seen that.
[02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:54.860]  If he comes back tonight, I'll do it.
[02:06:54.860 --> 02:06:55.860]  I know jujitsu, man.
[02:06:55.860 --> 02:06:56.860]  I'm going to get him.
[02:06:56.860 --> 02:06:58.860]  I can play the spoons and the washboard too.
[02:06:58.860 --> 02:07:00.860]  Jujitsu don't work on deer, bro.
[02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:02.860]  Yeah, that's what she said.
[02:07:02.860 --> 02:07:03.860]  All right.
[02:07:03.860 --> 02:07:04.860]  Can I even ask you about the clear?
[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:05.860]  Am I allowed to ask?
[02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:06.860]  What do you want to know?
[02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:07.860]  What can you tell me about the clear?
[02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:12.860]  A lot of my listeners, this is listened to by people from all over the world,
[02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:14.860]  not just people in Colorado or Cali that know what's up.
[02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:17.860]  A lot of the people listening have a hard time finding pot.
[02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:21.860]  So the clear, if you just want to tell them kind of basically,
[02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:24.860]  they probably know about shatter and basic hashes from listening,
[02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:27.860]  but if you want to give them an update on what the clear actually is,
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:28.860]  that'd be awesome.
[02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:35.860]  So clear is a brand of product that we started a couple years ago in California,
[02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:39.860]  and it was sort of the first, I guess,
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:46.860]  popularized purified cannabis oil that we coined the name clear
[02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:51.860]  because it was always a nice high clarity and low color.
[02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:58.860]  And kind of we're one of the first quote solvent-free companies that existed.
[02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:04.860]  And so people have their own ways of making these activated cannabinoids,
[02:08:04.860 --> 02:08:05.860]  and they're obviously colorized and stuff.
[02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:07.860]  And so we don't really speak to how we do it.
[02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:08.860]  We'd like to just keep it always a secret.
[02:08:08.860 --> 02:08:09.860]  Much respect.
[02:08:09.860 --> 02:08:11.860]  So other people do it and tell you how they do it.
[02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:15.860]  But as far as us, we kind of stick to just a purification method.
[02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:19.860]  And we have our own particulars as to what machines we use.
[02:08:19.860 --> 02:08:22.860]  We build a lot of our own machines and have our own processes and things like that.
[02:08:22.860 --> 02:08:25.860]  So kind of just particulars.
[02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:29.860]  And we have our own like unique flavors that we then blend back in,
[02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:33.860]  and we have our own natural flavors that can range from cannabis-type flavors
[02:08:33.860 --> 02:08:37.860]  that have high terpene content to like your standard strawberry or grape.
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:42.860]  And we have sort of a flavor department that we pump out different flavors
[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:43.860]  and try to keep the flavors.
[02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:46.860]  Are those flavors derived from cannabis or other products?
[02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:48.860]  So they're all derived from other products.
[02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:51.860]  Everything's natural, and none of them are like, for instance,
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:53.860]  the terpenes that we use are steam distilled,
[02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:55.860]  and all the flavors we use are high grade
[02:08:56.860 --> 02:09:01.860]  and are all based off of like a lot of essential oils and things like that.
[02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:03.860]  So we have lime oils and oranges.
[02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:04.860]  You're not getting Chinese things?
[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:05.860]  No, no.
[02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:07.860]  And we try to make sure that these are like the highest grade stuff,
[02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:08.860]  nothing Chinese sourced.
[02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:11.860]  I've talked to you for a couple of nights, and I trust you.
[02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:13.860]  I trust your judgment on that kind of product so far.
[02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:14.860]  Yeah.
[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:18.860]  And so there's a lot of great uses for products like this.
[02:09:18.860 --> 02:09:22.860]  We can use them for topicals and edibles and vapor cartridges and anything
[02:09:22.860 --> 02:09:24.860]  you can really want to formulate.
[02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:25.860]  So it's kind of cool.
[02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:26.860]  Right.
[02:09:26.860 --> 02:09:27.860]  I hear a lot of good things about the clear.
[02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:28.860]  We'll have to get our hands on some.
[02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:30.860]  Hunt, Hunt, I think that's your department.
[02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:34.860]  Yeah, it's out there.
[02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:35.860]  A few people that have it.
[02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:37.860]  It's just in Denver, not in the Springs yet.
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:38.860]  So I got to drive to Denver to get it.
[02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:42.860]  We are slowly making our distribution through Colorado.
[02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:43.860]  There you go.
[02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:44.860]  Bigger and wider.
[02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:46.860]  Green and healthy wellness is interested, I think.
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:47.860]  Wow.
[02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:49.860]  Let's put that together.
[02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:50.860]  The boss is behind me laughing.
[02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:52.860]  He's like, hey, wait, how can you say that?
[02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:53.860]  You do the grow.
[02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:54.860]  I do the managing.
[02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:55.860]  You shut your face.
[02:09:55.860 --> 02:09:58.860]  All right.
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:00.860]  Jordan, what's up with Turpex, bro?
[02:10:00.860 --> 02:10:02.860]  Hey, dude, thanks for the update on the clear.
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:03.860]  I appreciate that.
[02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:04.860]  You got it.
[02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:05.860]  I appreciate it.
[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:07.860]  What's up with the Turpex, brother?
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:12.860]  We are, you know, we're doing recreational processing up in Denver right now.
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:15.860]  We're still doing medical processing down here in Colorado Springs.
[02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:19.860]  Going to have a pretty large grow that is about to be up and running for our
[02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:22.860]  medical wholesale.
[02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:25.860]  Going to have a lot of really awesome flavors that we're going to be making
[02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:26.860]  out of there.
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:29.860]  Everything that gets grown in that facility has to be extracted.
[02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:34.860]  So, you know, we'll have a lot of really, really awesome turps on the market.
[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:36.860]  It has to be extracted.
[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:37.860]  Has to be extracted.
[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:38.860]  A lot of early run earls, bro.
[02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:39.860]  Nice.
[02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:40.860]  Nothing wrong with turps.
[02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:41.860]  Full plant run.
[02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:42.860]  Turps, yep.
[02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:45.860]  Then also, you know, it's going to be a pretty exciting month.
[02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:51.860]  We are going out to Illinois in the middle of this month, and we are doing
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:56.860]  some consulting out there with one of the first operators to get up and running
[02:10:56.860 --> 02:10:58.860]  for medical cannabis in Illinois.
[02:10:58.860 --> 02:11:03.860]  We're going to be going out there to extract their crop and, you know, help get
[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:08.860]  their processing operation going, help them with some of the, you know,
[02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:11.860]  processing preparation, you know, trimming and all that kind of stuff.
[02:11:11.860 --> 02:11:12.860]  Expand the brand.
[02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:13.860]  That's awesome.
[02:11:13.860 --> 02:11:15.860]  We're not, that's not really a brand situation.
[02:11:15.860 --> 02:11:19.860]  You know, the market in Illinois is very small.
[02:11:19.860 --> 02:11:23.860]  So, it's more of like a consultation help, you know, kind of do like a co-brand
[02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:27.860]  private label type situation where we go out there and help create their brand,
[02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:32.860]  which is, you know, one of the first, you know, they'll have some of the first
[02:11:32.860 --> 02:11:37.860]  infused products available in the Illinois medical cannabis market and probably,
[02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:41.860]  you know, be some of the first legal butane extractions to be done in that state,
[02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:43.860]  if not the first.
[02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:48.860]  We're also going to be getting up and running in Las Vegas within the next month,
[02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:50.860]  which should also be very exciting.
[02:11:50.860 --> 02:11:52.860]  So, that'll be right about when this comes out.
[02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:54.860]  This will probably come out in about two or three weeks.
[02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:55.860]  So, right when this drops.
[02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:58.860]  Well, yeah, hopefully that will be right around the time, around the first of the
[02:11:58.860 --> 02:12:00.860]  year where we're getting up and running in Las Vegas.
[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:04.860]  That will be, you know, Turpex branded products that we're going to be, you know,
[02:12:04.860 --> 02:12:09.860]  selling Wax Shatter, Vape Pens, things like that throughout the Las Vegas market.
[02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:14.860]  Our, you know, we originally came out here from California and it'll be pretty
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:18.860]  awesome because now California patients will have access to the products that we
[02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:22.860]  make again because Nevada has reciprocal medical marijuana laws.
[02:12:22.860 --> 02:12:25.860]  So, anybody, yeah, reciprocity.
[02:12:25.860 --> 02:12:26.860]  Reciprocity.
[02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:28.860]  Shout out to Dan for going to English class.
[02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:31.860]  That's a grammar lesson that we'll get into later.
[02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:34.860]  So, if you're in Vegas and you have a California medical marijuana card,
[02:12:34.860 --> 02:12:36.860]  you can shop at a Vegas dispensary.
[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:40.860]  You can shop at a Vegas dispensary, Reno, any Nevada medical marijuana dispensary.
[02:12:40.860 --> 02:12:41.860]  Can you take your Colorado card there as well?
[02:12:41.860 --> 02:12:42.860]  Yep.
[02:12:42.860 --> 02:12:43.860]  Sweet.
[02:12:43.860 --> 02:12:44.860]  I heard that.
[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:46.860]  Go to Vegas and take your medical marijuana card and go shopping, get some herb.
[02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:47.860]  Yep.
[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:48.860]  They are up and running out there.
[02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:49.860]  So, you know.
[02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:50.860]  Go get some Turpex at the first of the year.
[02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:51.860]  Dab it out.
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:52.860]  Dab it out.
[02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:53.860]  Definitely, yeah.
[02:12:53.860 --> 02:12:54.860]  Let you guys know where the drops are happening.
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:57.860]  How much of the, so you guys were talking about nug runs.
[02:12:57.860 --> 02:13:00.860]  All of the room you're growing has to be made into Earl.
[02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:03.860]  What percentage of that, and if I'm out of line, just let me know and I won't ask
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:07.860]  the question, how much of that product will actually be sold as smokable Earl and how
[02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:11.860]  much of it will be sold to a vendor and turned into something like a topical or an
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:12.860]  edible or something?
[02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:16.860]  I would say a hundred percent of that will be sold as smokable oil.
[02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:17.860]  Okay.
[02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:23.860]  You know, it's, we, you know, we, we take pretty, we take pretty good steps in the grow
[02:13:23.860 --> 02:13:26.860]  to make sure that, you know, we have the really high quality.
[02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:31.860]  We wish we were able to let people, you know, experience the flowers, but the fact that
[02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:36.860]  we can take all that high quality flower product and turn it into extracts, you know, we want
[02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:42.860]  to get as much of that branded Turpex awesome nug run flavor on the market as possible.
[02:13:42.860 --> 02:13:45.860]  So I would say most of that product will be sold as smokable oil.
[02:13:45.860 --> 02:13:49.860]  If we start delving into other products and find that, you know, it's more beneficial
[02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:52.860]  to do things that way.
[02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:56.860]  You know, maybe we're working to that now, but right now the plan is to just make
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:14:00.860]  grab it out or wax, live resin, maybe some bubble hash, live resin.
[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:02.860]  You want to talk about live resin for a minute?
[02:14:02.860 --> 02:14:04.860]  I heard you say something to a client earlier.
[02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:07.860]  The bottom line, bro, what makes it live resin and what doesn't?
[02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:09.860]  Just so it's, I've said this on the show and people call me a hater.
[02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:11.860]  What makes it live resin?
[02:14:11.860 --> 02:14:17.860]  The fact that it's a live plant that's cut down and then frozen before it is dried.
[02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:19.860]  And what machine do you run it through?
[02:14:19.860 --> 02:14:26.860]  We use an Emotech at our Colorado operations, as well as the ones that we'll use in Nevada
[02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:28.860]  and Illinois.
[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:29.860]  See guys, I didn't even say it.
[02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:30.860]  I didn't bait him.
[02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:33.860]  We just let him say his thing and he backed up everything I have said.
[02:14:33.860 --> 02:14:34.860]  Nice.
[02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:35.860]  Thank you, bro.
[02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:39.860]  So what the question really comes down to, there are some like little small distinctions
[02:14:39.860 --> 02:14:40.860]  in like live resin.
[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:44.860]  Some people will dry like a slight bit and then freeze versus like a full dry.
[02:14:44.860 --> 02:14:45.860]  How do you feel?
[02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:47.860]  Do you consider that any drying?
[02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:49.860]  You think it's the immediate cut and freeze?
[02:14:49.860 --> 02:14:53.860]  Because some people complain about like tubes clogging up with water and doing, you know,
[02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:54.860]  fucked up shit.
[02:14:54.860 --> 02:14:57.860]  I mean, I would say live resin is really not meant for a tube.
[02:14:58.860 --> 02:15:03.860]  The live resin process, I would just, you know, because of the way everything gets clogged
[02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:06.860]  and everything like that, I just would never recommend doing it in a tube versus a system.
[02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:09.860]  You take the same steps as like fresh frozen ice water.
[02:15:09.860 --> 02:15:12.860]  Instead though, you just blast it, you know?
[02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:13.860]  Yeah.
[02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:14.860]  All right.
[02:15:14.860 --> 02:15:16.860]  So if I do it through like a sweet leaf, am I still making live resin?
[02:15:16.860 --> 02:15:18.860]  Is it going to come out the same?
[02:15:18.860 --> 02:15:19.860]  Yeah.
[02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:20.860]  I don't know.
[02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:21.860]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:15:21.860 --> 02:15:22.860]  I've never used it.
[02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:23.860]  I've never used it.
[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:26.860]  Yeah, see, I think theoretically it wouldn't matter like, you know, what machine you use.
[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:27.860]  It's kind of like a style, right?
[02:15:27.860 --> 02:15:28.860]  Yeah.
[02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:31.860]  It's kind of like the fact that the plant has not had a chance to dry at all or through it.
[02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:35.860]  I mean, the machine is just another variable that you just got to compensate for to try
[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:38.860]  to get the end product that you're looking for, you know?
[02:15:38.860 --> 02:15:43.860]  If the machine operates a little bit differently, you just, if you have the experience, you
[02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:47.860]  figure it out, adjust it, try to compensate and make, you know?
[02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:49.860]  It's a process, you know?
[02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:51.860]  I don't really think, you know, live resin is...
[02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:58.860]  What do you guys prefer as far as like type of now grown, cured, long-cured, fresh-dried?
[02:15:58.860 --> 02:15:59.860]  Fresh-dried.
[02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:00.860]  Yeah.
[02:16:00.860 --> 02:16:05.860]  There's certain strains that come out amazing as live resin that, you know, really tastes
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:07.860]  awesome, but I think those are...
[02:16:07.860 --> 02:16:09.860]  What's like the tangy tangies?
[02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:15.860]  Yeah, like tangy lemon and like all those ones taste amazing as live resin, but all
[02:16:15.860 --> 02:16:17.860]  of those taste amazing dry cured too.
[02:16:17.860 --> 02:16:18.860]  Fresh-dried too.
[02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:23.860]  I think the main reason why people like live resin so much is because the color.
[02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:24.860]  Yeah, totally.
[02:16:24.860 --> 02:16:25.860]  Color.
[02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:26.860]  And it brings out a lot of flavor.
[02:16:26.860 --> 02:16:27.860]  But certain types of flavors...
[02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:28.860]  It does, but I feel like strains...
[02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:33.860]  Certain flavors get muted down by like this kind of watery thing.
[02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:35.860]  Yeah, it's planty, it's vegetative.
[02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:41.860]  Yeah, but certain strains in live resin, the turps are amplified and other strains I feel
[02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:42.860]  like it takes...
[02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:43.860]  Like OG.
[02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:46.860]  Yeah, other strains I feel like it takes like a nice like dry and cure to really bring out
[02:16:46.860 --> 02:16:48.860]  the turps to their like maximum potential.
[02:16:48.860 --> 02:16:49.860]  I'll agree with that, yeah.
[02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:50.860]  But when that happens...
[02:16:50.860 --> 02:16:52.860]  I've never tasted a good OG live resin.
[02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:53.860]  True.
[02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:57.860]  But when that happens, the oil's not going to be as aesthetically pleasing as if it's
[02:16:57.860 --> 02:17:00.860]  cut down early, frozen, and extracted.
[02:17:00.860 --> 02:17:01.860]  True.
[02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:03.860]  In that form, you know, it's going to look piss yellow.
[02:17:03.860 --> 02:17:04.860]  Yeah.
[02:17:04.860 --> 02:17:05.860]  So...
[02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:08.860]  Yeah, I've learned to take the plants a little bit early if I know they're going to be oil.
[02:17:08.860 --> 02:17:10.860]  It makes it look so much better.
[02:17:10.860 --> 02:17:15.860]  It's definitely a tactic that a lot of growers use.
[02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:16.860]  All right.
[02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:17.860]  These days.
[02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:18.860]  I just want to go around the room.
[02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:21.860]  What's your favorite strain to smoke as a flower and favorite to dab?
[02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:22.860]  That's funny.
[02:17:22.860 --> 02:17:24.860]  I was just talking to Chris about this.
[02:17:24.860 --> 02:17:30.860]  My favorite was always the SFVOG and I haven't had it in quite some time, but that's the
[02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:33.860]  ultimate in flower and dab form.
[02:17:33.860 --> 02:17:35.860]  The San Fernando Valley OG Kush.
[02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:36.860]  Yeah.
[02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:37.860]  It's going to...
[02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:38.860]  I'm going to...
[02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:40.860]  If I ask a lot of people, if I asked 100 people, I bet 50 of them would say the SFVOG.
[02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:41.860]  It's awesome.
[02:17:41.860 --> 02:17:42.860]  And probably 40 of them didn't smoke the real one.
[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:43.860]  Yeah, oh, I have.
[02:17:43.860 --> 02:17:44.860]  I'm sure you have.
[02:17:44.860 --> 02:17:45.860]  I know who you are, bro.
[02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:46.860]  I know who you are, brother.
[02:17:46.860 --> 02:17:47.860]  Oh, Chris is thinking about it already.
[02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:48.860]  You want us to skip you for a second?
[02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:49.860]  Yeah, I'm going to pass for a second.
[02:17:49.860 --> 02:17:50.860]  All right.
[02:17:50.860 --> 02:17:51.860]  Brian, favorite strains?
[02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:52.860]  I really like smoking Jack Rare flower and really any African sativa.
[02:17:52.860 --> 02:17:53.860]  I just love the German poison, the snow cap.
[02:17:53.860 --> 02:17:54.860]  He likes to get shit done.
[02:17:54.860 --> 02:17:55.860]  Nigerian nightmare type of stuff.
[02:17:55.860 --> 02:17:56.860]  All those guys.
[02:17:56.860 --> 02:17:57.860]  They just have that.
[02:17:57.860 --> 02:17:58.860]  I think it's terpenoline is a common term.
[02:17:58.860 --> 02:17:59.860]  I don't know.
[02:17:59.860 --> 02:18:00.860]  I don't know.
[02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:01.860]  I don't know.
[02:18:01.860 --> 02:18:02.860]  I don't know.
[02:18:02.860 --> 02:18:03.860]  I don't know.
[02:18:03.860 --> 02:18:04.860]  I don't know.
[02:18:04.860 --> 02:18:05.860]  I don't know.
[02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:06.860]  I don't know.
[02:18:06.860 --> 02:18:07.860]  I don't know.
[02:18:07.860 --> 02:18:08.860]  I don't know.
[02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:09.860]  I don't know.
[02:18:39.860 --> 02:18:59.260]  I just, I love to dab that and I love to smoke that on flour.
[02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:01.700]  It just, when it's done right, it's done.
[02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:02.840]  It can be done so well.
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:04.140]  I want to assume that terpenoline is a terpenoid.
[02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:05.140]  It is.
[02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:06.140]  Yeah.
[02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:07.140]  Correct.
[02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:08.140]  Chris wants to talk.
[02:19:08.140 --> 02:19:09.140]  Yeah, let's hear it.
[02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:13.700]  Well, you can really that's I think like if you're gonna get into turp turpines
[02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:16.300]  That's when you're gonna be able to pick up more than more than most
[02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:20.920]  That's like most people are gonna identify that because it stands a little different than most the turpines
[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:23.220]  Let's spice a little bit more sweet. Okay
[02:19:25.100 --> 02:19:27.100]  What's your favorite stream
[02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:37.780]  Like that old old school blueberry just that we're talking about that last night. Yeah that DJ short blueberry short style
[02:19:37.780 --> 02:19:39.780]  Is that flour?
[02:19:42.700 --> 02:19:49.180]  We got that we call lemon grab and we got apparently, you know just passed down through a number of people through
[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:55.820]  The homey out at Orm Farms up in Seattle and it was apparently some 20 year old lemon from Soma
[02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:58.960]  It is just a killer strain. It's just makes this like just
[02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:05.820]  Intense lemon and has none of the turpine lean taste and it's a lot different than you know, the common lemons
[02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:10.520]  I think we talked about yesterday much different than yeah, no tangy notes. No
[02:20:11.540 --> 02:20:13.060]  No
[02:20:13.060 --> 02:20:15.060]  What was that lemon we were talking about?
[02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:25.940]  Lemon lemon G. This was really cool to have this sort of like unique lemon strain
[02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:29.900]  We had a nice harvest that we grew in house and made some amazing oil. So
[02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:32.540]  Those are my favorite strains nice
[02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:35.260]  It's all you my friend
[02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:37.820]  breather
[02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:48.660]  Yeah, I mean a good perp, you know granddaddy perp for yeah, granddaddy flour and dabbers
[02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:54.500]  That's a flower, you know, just blunt swisher sweets at granddaddy perp and call it a day
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:21:03.080]  But you know granddaddy perps probably a favorite but you know mainly more, you know, I really love OG
[02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:06.520]  Good OG G cut OG is my particular
[02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:17.560]  Most of the room went for the OGs. Yeah, I would say the OGs and
[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:22.640]  Yeah, and definitely cam I've been going really heavy on like some chem DS and
[02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:28.680]  91s lately like those a lot as well. But yeah, mainly, you know G cut OG flower
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:34.680]  Dad I'll cook it up from that from time to time. It's a unique thing. Yeah
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:51.760]  Break it up and you get a little something different, you know
[02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:54.840]  Have you guys
[02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:58.480]  Compared the the gorilla glue number fours with the s1s
[02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:02.680]  We have a couple packs of the s1s that we got from
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:10.160]  The homie ain't a nonprofit out in California. We have not popped those just yet now that we've got this new warehouse firing off
[02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:13.920]  I think we're gonna check them out and we have the cut of the GG for
[02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:20.520]  So, you know, it'll be it'll be we'll be able to do a pretty nice little side-by-side we go listen
[02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:23.960]  Yeah, I've grown a ton of GG for so I'll be able to recognize it a little bit
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:27.020]  So we're talking about the granddaddy purple and I said it's not my favorite
[02:22:27.020 --> 02:22:28.800]  I'm gonna kind of dis your strain here
[02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:32.680]  But then I've got the two guys in the room that are gonna be able to explain to me why I don't like it
[02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:38.760]  When I smoke granddaddy perps no matter and it's a lot of purple buds do this to me when they're dried and cured
[02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:44.320]  They taste like they are still wet. Is that have you experienced that or does that make sense to you that it's tastes like
[02:22:44.320 --> 02:22:47.720]  There's moisture in the bud or I don't like the flavor of granddaddy perps
[02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:52.460]  The moisture content shouldn't be affected
[02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:58.960]  Directly I don't think it's actually moisture. It just tastes like wetness or
[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:10.360]  Different sort of like floral top notes terpenoids things that are like a little bit less like elucidated
[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:13.960]  I would think you like to cannabis like sort of spectrum relative to like the simple terpene
[02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:19.760]  so you've got like a situation where like how they age and how they oxidize is
[02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:25.400]  Kind of dependent so you may get that effect some people might identify that physical
[02:23:26.040 --> 02:23:31.200]  Freshest fuck smelling. Yeah, and that's almost what it tastes like every time even when it's right and cured properly
[02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:35.240]  You know granddaddy perps a fickle a fickle lady, you know what? I mean?
[02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:47.640]  There's different phenos and cuts and whatnot, I feel like there's definitely one that's like a little bit heavier on like the cardboard
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:53.440]  Which may be kind of what you're talking about a little bit it kind of sweat, you know
[02:23:53.520 --> 02:23:56.000]  It's there kind of smells like maybe it was cured in a wet
[02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:05.160]  That being said though, I don't know where you're getting a lot of your GDP from but
[02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:09.960]  What I said true that but yeah, it's all purple buds in my opinion
[02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:12.560]  It's what was this GDP you were growing or was this GDP?
[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:15.160]  You know, I've never grown it because I'm not if I've never been a fan
[02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:23.120]  GDP was a hugely mass-produced strain out of California for quite some period of time and was one of the you know
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:26.240]  You know was one of the earlier ones
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:33.680]  Massive yeah massive commercial style grow warehouses where they're sending it across the country
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:41.160]  Wasn't really part of the equation
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:48.440]  Of the granddaddy perps I'll grow the shit out of it I'll trim it myself
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:58.680]  Purple leaves not purple trichomes if I'm not mistaken
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:08.600]  Different color bubble coming out and I'm pretty sure I'm mistaken those make busted purple leaves
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:10.600]  Right
[02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:17.040]  Yeah, I mean depending on how it's done you can have green grapes, you know, yeah nice
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:22.440]  I'll go for it bro. I talk a lot of green grapes are my favorite
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:30.500]  All right, the black cherry Kim is well known for its purple but one of those green phenotypes is amazing
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:32.560]  It's one of the keepers. Yeah, that's my only
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:36.160]  And it's way out of the purple range. Is that black cherry Kim?
[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:38.480]  But it doesn't taste like anything else purple
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:46.760]  All right. I wanted to ask what happened to why did the original turpex Instagram get the kibosh what happened there?
[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:54.080]  The suits came in and said it's time to clean it up
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:08.640]  Yeah, they should be down
[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:11.360]  People people don't even like really sell DNA
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:14.960]  we even got so got so far as to get a hold of somebody over there and they
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:18.160]  You know told us can have
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:21.200]  Certain information on there that we had on
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:28.040]  Oh really any sort of pricing information
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:36.560]  No contact I'm opening my Instagram right now to see if I've got contact info on there because they shut me down at 50
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:38.560]  I was at 19 K
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:44.680]  And I'm at like 1500 and I feel dumb. Well, yeah, so let's make a song about that. Yeah, let's
[02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:12.100]  Oh
[02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:42.860]  I
[02:28:10.100 --> 02:28:17.780]  I've got crack DM me for info. I've got crack DM me for info
[02:28:18.020 --> 02:28:20.020]  I've got lean
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:22.300]  DM me for info
[02:28:22.820 --> 02:28:25.900]  I'll get you whatever you need
[02:28:29.340 --> 02:28:31.340]  Yeah
[02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:37.420]  Instagram we're coming for you and we're not taking no for an answer
[02:28:37.780 --> 02:28:45.020]  We will post pictures of our slabs and our glass and our weed fuck you indeed
[02:28:49.180 --> 02:28:51.340]  I just wanna post
[02:28:53.860 --> 02:28:55.860]  Freely
[02:28:56.740 --> 02:29:01.140]  That was the Instagram song ladies and gentlemen, do you guys have a band name or are you just the turpy?
[02:29:01.140 --> 02:29:03.660]  We are doc butthole in the brown eyes doc butthole
[02:29:04.540 --> 02:29:07.540]  That's a great segue now, I think what has been demanded
[02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:12.500]  Miss damsel just walked by and wanted to hear the butthole song
[02:29:13.420 --> 02:29:16.740]  Is there such a thing as the butthole song that happens between you two?
[02:29:26.060 --> 02:29:27.740]  What would it take
[02:29:27.740 --> 02:29:31.840]  To get you boys to riff a little bit of the butthole riff here on the show for me
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:33.840]  You would probably take those five buttholes
[02:29:40.600 --> 02:29:44.880]  We might have to pause real quick and come back once we get the whole crew that's not gonna happen
[02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:53.300]  We'll see if we can tempt this young man to sing some butthole jams for us here we go
[02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:55.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, butthole jam volume one
[02:29:56.280 --> 02:30:00.480]  Live on the girl from your heart podcast brought to you by Danny growing from our hearts right now
[02:30:01.840 --> 02:30:03.840]  This is what you guys tuned in for
[02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:07.240]  Your life is less important
[02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:10.920]  Have you ever
[02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:15.240]  Seen a cute little butthole
[02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:18.360]  highly inappropriate that you
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:21.200]  Just wanted
[02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:26.160]  To maybe paint a picture of it
[02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:33.440]  And maybe do some other things as well
[02:30:38.030 --> 02:30:40.030]  Like
[02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:42.790]  Your tongue in the
[02:30:46.110 --> 02:30:51.070]  Yeah, you know that we like to lick lots of butthole
[02:30:51.070 --> 02:30:53.070]  I
[02:30:54.670 --> 02:31:02.230]  Taste so good. It tastes so sweet tastes kind of like a coconut meat
[02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:17.110]  Hey Jeff when was the last time you ate but
[02:31:18.510 --> 02:31:20.510]  More recently than I care to admit
[02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:24.630]  It's what a lucky guy
[02:31:26.830 --> 02:31:32.270]  To have those butthole turps for dinner, but every night
[02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:37.670]  I'm sure she will fight
[02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:41.950]  It shines like a diamond when you're done cuz it's so damn clean
[02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:49.630]  Licking but is serene
[02:31:56.070 --> 02:31:59.070]  If I don't lick it for a while I get mean
[02:31:59.070 --> 02:32:07.510]  If I don't lick it for a while I get mean
[02:32:13.340 --> 02:32:15.340]  Gotta blow off some steam
[02:32:18.700 --> 02:32:25.780]  Keep it clean, you know, my favorite strain is blue tree
[02:32:31.180 --> 02:32:36.780]  Blue dream kinda tastes like a strippers ass crack I am piney
[02:32:42.280 --> 02:32:44.400]  Strippers love dream
[02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:53.960]  Strippers love blue dream if there's one thing I know in my years in this game
[02:32:55.840 --> 02:32:59.200]  Dream makes strippers go insane
[02:33:03.320 --> 02:33:07.960]  Blue dream and some glitter on your butthole
[02:33:09.760 --> 02:33:11.760]  That's how you know
[02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:15.740]  You are smoking that strippers delight
[02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:19.040]  blue dream
[02:33:33.950 --> 02:33:35.950]  Dream
[02:33:37.430 --> 02:33:39.430]  All right
[02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:06.030]  We've got we've gone a long time and I want to reward my listeners everyone that's made it through the butthole song
[02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:11.350]  That's made it all the shenanigans through the shenanigans. Let's talk about hash. We've got some amazing hash artists here in the in the room
[02:34:11.590 --> 02:34:14.390]  Everyone's nice. You're relaxed. We're all comfortable. We're all friends now
[02:34:15.110 --> 02:34:20.390]  What's coming up with hash? What's gonna be next? We've got clear hash. We've got dissolvable
[02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:27.470]  Dr. Pepper turps, that's the truth. Everyone's talking turps. Everyone talks turps. They don't really even know what turps mean
[02:34:27.470 --> 02:34:30.750]  Yeah, most people don't know what a flavor we're gonna call it flavor components
[02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:32.870]  Flavors
[02:34:35.670 --> 02:34:41.470]  Turps and I think you know got some people out there doing some little turpine isolates and stuff like that
[02:34:41.470 --> 02:34:43.470]  but I think the game is gonna be
[02:34:43.550 --> 02:34:49.110]  You know sort of just keeping the essence of cannabis so that everyone can experience it and all the different formulations
[02:34:49.110 --> 02:34:53.070]  You know, it's like a kind of more of an art and cannabinoids. They're a little bit more stable
[02:34:53.670 --> 02:34:58.590]  And flavors are kind of like a are you know perfumers and people who do that sort of extraction?
[02:34:58.590 --> 02:35:04.750]  You know doing it for a long time and have a lot of their own methods and I think cannabis hasn't quite
[02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:08.270]  Matured to that level of science and it's kind of getting there
[02:35:09.150 --> 02:35:14.550]  Just now been given the freedom. We were a little uh, we were prohibited from doing that experimentation
[02:35:14.630 --> 02:35:17.830]  All right. So you feel like turps are next you look like you got something important to say
[02:35:17.830 --> 02:35:19.830]  I was gonna say
[02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:21.830]  We definitely have not been
[02:35:21.830 --> 02:35:24.450]  Inhibited on doing that because those are all those are all legal
[02:35:24.510 --> 02:35:25.010]  Okay
[02:35:25.010 --> 02:35:30.430]  And so some people have been doing some research on on terpenes for a while as in with regard to I mean
[02:35:31.270 --> 02:35:33.270]  aromatherapy, that's a
[02:35:33.310 --> 02:35:35.310]  lot of people poopoo on that but it's
[02:35:35.870 --> 02:35:38.410]  It's definitely real and we in the cannabis game
[02:35:38.410 --> 02:35:42.110]  We see that that's real because it's one of the things that gets us either way that we want to
[02:35:42.750 --> 02:35:44.750]  so
[02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:48.430]  Use it for people using lavender oil and stuff like that just
[02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:53.230]  Bedside steamers and stuff like that or whatever the
[02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:55.990]  essential essence
[02:35:55.990 --> 02:36:00.270]  So if I mean, it's definitely real and so incorporating that in the cannabis is pretty cool
[02:36:00.910 --> 02:36:07.550]  Keeping even that original essence and so coming up with the different extractions and trying to get just the terpenes and then
[02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:12.750]  Get plants that produce a lot of terpenes and there's there's pretty neat
[02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:18.070]  Information out there and theories on how you can influence the terpene levels by
[02:36:18.430 --> 02:36:22.190]  Soil management and like environmental controls and stuff like that. Okay
[02:36:22.190 --> 02:36:28.190]  And it's you know, this isn't the only industry where terpenes are prevalent or where people want the terpenes from what we're growing
[02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:31.710]  So there's a lot of a lot of literature around there about
[02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:34.270]  different
[02:36:34.270 --> 02:36:40.070]  Lavender oil like I said is a big one like rosehip oil or just all sorts of things and they want to be able to
[02:36:40.270 --> 02:36:46.030]  Extract those super efficiently and so you can look at some of those these other industries and follow their lead on how to
[02:36:46.710 --> 02:36:48.230]  better extract
[02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:51.870]  the stuff that you want and like an environmentally friendly and
[02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:54.110]  easy way
[02:36:54.110 --> 02:36:58.630]  So that's that's definitely big and that's gonna be just a big part of the future probably
[02:36:59.350 --> 02:37:03.670]  You said that environmental factors play a lot into my terpenoids and my soil
[02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:08.590]  I know you're not you're more on the hash side than you are the grow game from what I understand about you
[02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:15.270]  Could you give myself and my listeners one hint on how we could improve our turps in our garden one thing that we could just
[02:37:15.270 --> 02:37:18.150]  Stop doing or start doing it would correct our turps
[02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:28.550]  Sounds good to me you guys you heard it here. He's gonna read that and find
[02:37:29.590 --> 02:37:32.670]  You look like you got something to say Jordan. So the Rosenbrook
[02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:36.630]  So the Rosenbrook triple threat a lot of my friends listen to this podcast
[02:37:37.270 --> 02:37:42.230]  I've tasted one person's rosin that I liked everything else tastes like burnt popcorn
[02:37:44.230 --> 02:37:48.750]  Yeah, I had one guy my buddy Tim came through and he had some properly made Ross and I think he made it himself
[02:37:48.750 --> 02:37:52.130]  He was the only one who had rosin that I liked. It's all about that low temp
[02:37:55.830 --> 02:37:57.830]  Rosin from
[02:37:57.830 --> 02:38:00.750]  Get ready to get away from the plant manner, you know want that shit
[02:38:00.750 --> 02:38:02.990]  You don't want the cuticle waxes you want what's in the heads?
[02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:07.190]  anyway, why pressing it through all the all the all the stuff even if you did like a
[02:38:07.950 --> 02:38:15.630]  Half-efficient dry sift or any kind of other stuff gets you away from that bulk of the plant material and that's gonna increase your resin
[02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:18.550]  quality you're gonna get a lot less of the
[02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:23.510]  Resin stuck in the plant material and overall just gonna be more of a pleasant experience
[02:38:23.630 --> 02:38:25.630]  Just kind of come up with a reasonable sift
[02:38:26.030 --> 02:38:32.150]  Dry ice sift or you know, if you can keep the moisture away, you know, people are building out cold rooms
[02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:38.010]  Do and do go in the full the full length and so you can break that material down get away from all that leaf
[02:38:38.470 --> 02:38:43.330]  There it is. Okay. So oh man, that's a lot of work for a homegrower sometimes
[02:38:43.330 --> 02:38:47.910]  What's your what's the most recommended way of getting some dry sift out of that to work it into rosin? I
[02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:51.270]  Mean, I think you can just kind of promptly break down
[02:38:52.270 --> 02:38:59.030]  You know, they got rotate machines, okay, they've got ways of sifting material that can that are pretty efficient if you just
[02:39:00.430 --> 02:39:04.310]  Can I rosen my keef? Oh, yeah. I see a bunch of head nods
[02:39:05.390 --> 02:39:09.830]  Done that how'd that come out? It tastes like burnt popcorn or since we didn't use plant matter. Did it taste right?
[02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:15.030]  Ah, it tasted alright. Okay. I mean it definitely tastes better than what comes out of the flower
[02:39:15.630 --> 02:39:21.070]  You know shit in shit out as a classic and always the truth when it comes to any process true
[02:39:21.070 --> 02:39:27.070]  Very true. That's the truth. I consider that if it's keef and not like bubble or you know, you know, it's gonna keep
[02:39:35.070 --> 02:39:40.270]  Should I be doing with my reclaim I've got a drop-down that's probably got thrown it away just throw it away
[02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:44.390]  I'll process that for you for six to twelve dollars a gram
[02:39:44.390 --> 02:39:46.390]  I
[02:39:46.390 --> 02:39:50.470]  Keep it don't throw anything out, you know, yeah, you're rubbing put it in your oven heat the shit out of it
[02:39:50.470 --> 02:39:51.990]  Make it into CBN
[02:39:51.990 --> 02:39:57.470]  Okay, make sleepy time sleepy time CBN heat it up make it in and then just dab it again or make edibles with it
[02:39:58.790 --> 02:40:00.790]  All right
[02:40:02.670 --> 02:40:05.810]  But you'll probably find a calming sleepy time effect from it
[02:40:05.810 --> 02:40:09.430]  We've got a where I've got a video going and they said can we season our nails with reclaim?
[02:40:10.430 --> 02:40:13.290]  Yeah, yeah, why couldn't you bro? Yeah, you totally could
[02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:17.150]  If you're kind of like upset with your buddy, you know
[02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:21.470]  Take some of his like oil and just kind of use it like cleaning and you know, makes they can you know
[02:40:21.710 --> 02:40:23.710]  He brings the flame
[02:40:27.630 --> 02:40:33.190]  Boom one thing one thing I've seen recently regarding to the Ross and thing just jump back to that
[02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:37.630]  I saw a picture on the internet the other day of someone who had smashed their fingers
[02:40:38.430 --> 02:40:40.430]  It was a girl because there's girl fingernails
[02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:50.990]  Super look, you know low temp high pressure situations and didn't get their fingers out of the way and it was
[02:40:52.150 --> 02:40:57.590]  Not a pretty sight. It looked like you ran over a banana. Yeah. Yeah, it was is terrible
[02:40:57.590 --> 02:41:01.670]  I look like you microwave the hot dog. It was just yeah, that was a mess. Be careful Ross
[02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:05.590]  And I don't know about their kids. Yeah, most of you guys are using you stole your girlfriend's hair straightener
[02:41:05.590 --> 02:41:11.970]  They're not using a hydraulic press or anything fair that as goofy and stupid as it works is pretty damn good
[02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:14.230]  Yeah
[02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:22.710]  Actually flower and a hair straightener is the first time we tried it. What was that from the Gorilla Glue?
[02:41:26.390 --> 02:41:30.510]  I don't remember your Ross and virginity. Unfortunately, I think the thing we're gonna run into too
[02:41:30.510 --> 02:41:36.190]  Just like any of these other extracts is that with some plants will be better suited for terpene extraction
[02:41:36.190 --> 02:41:42.190]  Some plants will be better for like BHO. So absolutely for Ross and you get to certain heats and tension with certain terpenes
[02:41:42.190 --> 02:41:46.550]  No bueno, and certain ones are fine. So I think it's a matter of like where do these?
[02:41:47.310 --> 02:41:51.930]  If it's all going towards oil then there's five or six ways to make oil and that's gonna leave
[02:41:52.110 --> 02:41:55.990]  Different spectrums of which plants get turned in the GDP
[02:41:55.990 --> 02:42:02.310]  Maybe it gets pressed and doesn't taste like so right. So whatever or maybe it's like you really taste better when you get it first
[02:42:04.310 --> 02:42:06.310]  I like the way you think my friend
[02:42:06.310 --> 02:42:06.830]  Yeah

[02:58:59.240 --> 02:59:02.240]  So I won't back down
[02:59:02.240 --> 02:59:05.240]  I know that you know my intentions
[02:59:05.240 --> 02:59:08.240]  From the table I lay down my cards
[02:59:08.240 --> 02:59:10.240]  I'm making all the preparations
[02:59:10.240 --> 02:59:14.240]  To send my arrow to your heart
[02:59:14.240 --> 02:59:17.240]  I'll find the right words to say
[02:59:17.240 --> 02:59:20.240]  To get you into my world
[02:59:20.240 --> 02:59:26.240]  God knows I'm serious I'm not joking
[02:59:26.240 --> 02:59:29.240]  I invited her out to the movie
[02:59:29.240 --> 02:59:32.240]  Thought it was a flex she would like
[02:59:32.240 --> 02:59:34.240]  But she said let's find a disco
[02:59:34.240 --> 02:59:38.240]  Where we can jam all night
[02:59:38.240 --> 02:59:41.240]  We found a place so nice and cozy
[02:59:41.240 --> 02:59:44.240]  A few miles on the outskirts of town
[02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:48.240]  We got so close together I know
[02:59:48.240 --> 02:59:51.240]  She'll stick around
