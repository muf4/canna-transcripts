[00:00.000 --> 00:04.420]  What's up ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, smokers and growers.
[00:04.420 --> 00:08.900]  It is time for episode 462 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:08.900 --> 00:12.640]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:12.640 --> 00:17.180]  If you need new regular, feminized or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:17.180 --> 00:24.920]  Seeds Here Now and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:24.920 --> 00:28.520]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:28.520 --> 00:33.200]  Today I've been taking dabs of Head Trip full spectrum extract from our friends at Green
[00:33.200 --> 00:34.360]  Dot Labs.
[00:34.360 --> 00:37.700]  This is a blend of indigo diamond and chocolate tie.
[00:37.700 --> 00:43.200]  On the package, the flavor is described as lemon meringue, aftershave and mojito.
[00:43.200 --> 00:49.200]  The potency label says that this product contains 71.35% THC.
[00:49.200 --> 00:51.320]  Let's talk a little bit about the Head Trip.
[00:51.320 --> 00:54.320]  This stuff tastes interesting.
[00:54.320 --> 00:56.360]  It has got a really unique flavor.
[00:56.360 --> 00:59.520]  When you hit it, there is a lemon candy flavor that happens.
[00:59.520 --> 01:08.520]  Then on the exhale, there is a weird yet desirable, funky, delicious aftershave, tangy, mojito,
[01:08.520 --> 01:14.040]  lemon, minty sort of a thing that sticks into your mouth that I have never experienced before.
[01:14.040 --> 01:19.500]  I've never seen a concentrate described as aftershave in the flavor, but this one tastes
[01:19.500 --> 01:22.460]  like you are smoking a dab next to your old man.
[01:22.460 --> 01:27.140]  This smells like grandpa was splashing on some old man aftershave while you were taking
[01:27.140 --> 01:29.220]  a dab and you caught a whiff of it.
[01:29.220 --> 01:32.340]  That is really what this concentrate tastes like.
[01:32.340 --> 01:34.140]  I've had a lot of perfumey concentrates.
[01:34.140 --> 01:38.540]  I've had a lot of floral concentrates, but I've never had anything with the aftershave
[01:38.540 --> 01:39.540]  terp profile.
[01:39.540 --> 01:45.020]  So, big shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious and unique terps.
[01:45.020 --> 01:46.180]  Now let's talk about the buzz.
[01:46.180 --> 01:50.140]  I am obviously rambly, but I can't pay attention to what I'm saying.
[01:50.140 --> 01:53.420]  It's got me going a million miles an hour, but I don't know what is happening.
[01:53.420 --> 01:56.660]  So this is a really great concentrate for a podcast.
[01:56.660 --> 01:59.180]  I hope this show comes out well.
[01:59.180 --> 02:00.800]  All right, podcast world.
[02:00.800 --> 02:04.020]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of listener emails.
[02:04.020 --> 02:07.540]  Before we get there, I would like to do a shout out to a couple of our friends from
[02:07.540 --> 02:09.280]  Patreon.
[02:09.280 --> 02:11.820]  Let's start off with a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:11.820 --> 02:14.060]  Thank you and a fist bump to our friend Baked.
[02:14.060 --> 02:17.460]  How about a big thank you shout out to our friend Matthew KW.
[02:17.460 --> 02:20.620]  I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to my buddy
[02:20.620 --> 02:21.620]  Dick Goals.
[02:21.620 --> 02:26.140]  And last, but certainly not least, I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast
[02:26.140 --> 02:29.580]  thank you, shout out and a fist bump to our friend Brian B.
[02:29.580 --> 02:33.820]  I want to thank each and every one of you for the continued Patreon support.

[02:47.260 --> 02:48.780]  All right, podcast world.
[02:48.780 --> 02:51.420]  I did say that I have a couple of emails to read.
[02:51.420 --> 02:55.540]  Before we get there, let's hang out for a minute and talk about what is happening in
[02:55.540 --> 02:57.380]  my breeding room.
[02:57.380 --> 03:00.780]  It has been a little while since I have shared what is going on in my breeding room, so let's
[03:00.780 --> 03:04.260]  talk about my most current breeding project.
[03:04.260 --> 03:07.060]  I have recently pollinated the Mac.
[03:07.060 --> 03:08.060]  That's right.
[03:08.060 --> 03:09.060]  I've got a Mac cut.
[03:09.060 --> 03:10.060]  It was given to me by a great friend.
[03:10.060 --> 03:11.100]  It is the Mac 1.
[03:11.100 --> 03:12.420]  It is caps cut.
[03:12.420 --> 03:16.980]  If you're not familiar with the Mac, it is time to do some research on the Mac.
[03:16.980 --> 03:20.420]  The Miracle Alien Cookies is one of the new hype strains.
[03:20.420 --> 03:22.580]  It has been super popular for quite a while.
[03:22.580 --> 03:24.060]  The seeds always sell.
[03:24.060 --> 03:26.180]  Capulator sells a ton of seeds.
[03:26.180 --> 03:28.620]  The Mac has developed quite a reputation.
[03:28.620 --> 03:32.300]  The Mac has been spread around the country to a lot of respected growers, and I ended
[03:32.300 --> 03:33.380]  up with the cut.
[03:33.380 --> 03:34.380]  I took a clone.
[03:34.380 --> 03:35.520]  I got it well-rooted.
[03:35.520 --> 03:40.900]  I put it in the breeding room, and it has been pollinated by my stud, a rise male known
[03:40.900 --> 03:42.940]  as King Solomon.
[03:42.940 --> 03:49.220]  Now the Mac does have a reputation for not taking pollen very well, for not being a good
[03:49.220 --> 03:50.520]  breeder.
[03:50.520 --> 03:56.980]  It looks at this time like my Mac, female, has received plenty of pollen, and it is making
[03:56.980 --> 04:01.900]  quite a few nice, chunky, fat seeds that I can see.
[04:01.900 --> 04:06.180]  And usually, you can see the outer layer of seeds, and there is another complete layer
[04:06.180 --> 04:08.940]  of seeds inside the buds that aren't visible.
[04:08.940 --> 04:13.060]  So I feel like I probably have plenty of seeds for me to play with.
[04:13.060 --> 04:17.540]  This cross was not done with intentions for commercial release.
[04:17.540 --> 04:20.460]  I did this as a project for myself to play with.
[04:20.460 --> 04:23.700]  I want to see what the Arise and the Mac do together.
[04:23.700 --> 04:25.260]  The Arise is my stud.
[04:25.260 --> 04:27.020]  Arise has done very well for me.
[04:27.020 --> 04:29.580]  It has made a bunch of great progeny.
[04:29.580 --> 04:33.340]  So I wanted to see what happened when I put it to the Mac.
[04:33.340 --> 04:36.020]  Now let's talk about the Mac for a little bit.
[04:36.060 --> 04:38.020]  Why do I want to breed to the Mac?
[04:38.020 --> 04:39.620]  The Mac is a tremendous plant.
[04:39.620 --> 04:43.140]  It tastes very good when you dry and cure and smoke the buds.
[04:43.140 --> 04:45.940]  It gets you a special kind of stoned buzz.
[04:45.940 --> 04:47.460]  I really enjoy it.
[04:47.460 --> 04:49.860]  But there is a downside to the Mac.
[04:49.860 --> 04:55.000]  Unfortunately, the Mac grows very, very slowly.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.660]  It is the slowest growing plant I have ever worked with.
[04:58.660 --> 05:01.180]  It grows very slow in veg.
[05:01.180 --> 05:05.560]  And then when you put it in flour, when you think it's going to do that 21-day stretch,
[05:05.600 --> 05:07.000]  it doesn't give a shit.
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.040]  It does not stretch at all.
[05:09.040 --> 05:12.120]  It just slowly transitions to flour.
[05:12.120 --> 05:14.920]  Now once it's in flour, it acts just like any other plant.
[05:14.920 --> 05:19.800]  It doesn't take off with robust, crazy growth, but it does start stacking on the buds properly.
[05:19.800 --> 05:23.320]  It looks perfect once you get a couple of weeks into flour.
[05:23.320 --> 05:27.760]  But the Mac is a very slow growing plant.
[05:27.760 --> 05:31.080]  The leaves have really odd, mutated shapes.
[05:31.080 --> 05:32.080]  You'll see weird shit.
[05:32.080 --> 05:36.660]  If you feed the Mac wrong one time, it will be pissed off for a week.
[05:36.660 --> 05:39.320]  You have to get the Mac dialed in and figured out.
[05:39.320 --> 05:42.640]  The Mac is a very advanced grower's plant.
[05:42.640 --> 05:44.360]  That thing is not for a beginner grower.
[05:44.360 --> 05:48.160]  If you're a new grower and you've got the Mac, I wish you the best of luck.
[05:48.160 --> 05:51.240]  It is going to piss you off for a couple of runs.
[05:51.240 --> 05:58.120]  So my intention was to pollinate the Mac with my prized Arise Male to kind of increase the
[05:58.120 --> 05:59.600]  vigor of the Mac.
[05:59.600 --> 06:02.280]  I want to keep that Mac flavor.
[06:02.280 --> 06:09.260]  The Mac has got that gassy, sort of a, it's also got a fresh tennis ball, a fresh rubber
[06:09.260 --> 06:10.880]  sort of a smell to it.
[06:10.880 --> 06:12.320]  It's got an earthy smell to it.
[06:12.320 --> 06:19.080]  It's got a lot of really savory, gassy, earthy, lower note sort of smells to it.
[06:19.080 --> 06:24.120]  The Arise also has parents which carry those traits.
[06:24.120 --> 06:31.200]  So I'm hoping to find a phenotype which will closely represent the Mac flavor and aroma
[06:31.200 --> 06:34.640]  and also carry the Arise potency and vigor.
[06:34.640 --> 06:39.200]  So those are the traits I'm trying to find in the perfect, perfect phenotype that comes
[06:39.200 --> 06:40.200]  from this cross.
[06:40.200 --> 06:41.680]  That's the one I hope for.
[06:41.680 --> 06:43.320]  So that is my goal.
[06:43.320 --> 06:44.320]  That is my intention.
[06:44.320 --> 06:45.320]  I'd like to find a male.
[06:45.320 --> 06:50.260]  I'd like to find a couple of females and then I will begin other projects with that Mac
[06:50.260 --> 06:51.260]  to Arise cross.
[06:51.420 --> 06:54.740]  Maybe I'll find a male out of there that is very Mac dominant.
[06:54.740 --> 06:56.640]  Maybe I can do some pollinating with that.
[06:56.640 --> 07:00.980]  It is all about what these seeds from this first pollination do.
[07:00.980 --> 07:02.340]  I have to find out what happens.
[07:02.340 --> 07:03.940]  I don't know what I've created.
[07:03.940 --> 07:05.660]  I may have just made gold.
[07:05.660 --> 07:09.460]  I may have just made a bunch of shitty, useless mutant seeds.
[07:09.460 --> 07:11.620]  You never know until you grow them out.
[07:11.620 --> 07:13.620]  I've got to finish these seeds.
[07:13.620 --> 07:16.220]  They're still quite a ways away from being done.
[07:16.220 --> 07:17.540]  I've got to harvest the plants.
[07:17.540 --> 07:19.860]  I've got to get the seeds out of the plants.
[07:19.860 --> 07:21.220]  Then I've got to plant seeds.
[07:21.220 --> 07:26.060]  I've got to let those seeds veg, then flower, then they need to be harvested, then dried
[07:26.060 --> 07:27.060]  and cured.
[07:27.060 --> 07:31.960]  And then we need to smoke them and find out if what we have bred is worth a shit at all.
[07:31.960 --> 07:38.020]  So it is quite a ways away before I've got any input, any results on this project.
[07:38.020 --> 07:42.400]  At the time of recording, I'm about 30 days since pollination.
[07:42.400 --> 07:47.820]  So I've probably got 20 to 30 more days before I can even harvest the seeds, then give it
[07:47.820 --> 07:49.500]  a few days to dry.
[07:49.500 --> 07:51.900]  And I always need a little while to get the seeds out.
[07:51.900 --> 07:55.860]  And then I need to time these seeds into my rotation so that I can grow them.
[07:55.860 --> 08:00.140]  So it will be quite a while before we see what these seeds have even done.
[08:00.140 --> 08:03.380]  But I wanted to share with you that I have pollinated the Mac.
[08:03.380 --> 08:08.580]  It does appear that the Mac successfully took plenty of pollen, and I will have plenty of
[08:08.580 --> 08:11.980]  seeds for myself to play with and start some new projects.
[08:11.980 --> 08:14.860]  Now, there are a couple of things I've noticed about the Mac.
[08:14.860 --> 08:17.820]  People are frustrated when growing the Mac.
[08:17.820 --> 08:19.480]  Jaren grows the Mac like a champ.
[08:19.480 --> 08:22.000]  There are a couple of other people that have the Mac dialed in.
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.440]  Most of the time, I see people having frustration with the Mac.
[08:27.440 --> 08:32.280]  One thing I have learned quite quickly is that the Mac does prefer a lower pH.
[08:32.280 --> 08:37.520]  If you were used to keeping your garden around 6.4, 6.5 in that area, you may want to drop
[08:37.520 --> 08:43.440]  it down to 6.2 or 6.3, and the Mac will be a little bit happier in that condition.
[08:43.440 --> 08:47.740]  I have also found that the Mac responds very well to CalMag.
[08:47.740 --> 08:51.340]  It likes a little bit more CalMag than most of the other plants.
[08:51.340 --> 08:55.460]  Now, here is something that I have found very interesting with the Mac.
[08:55.460 --> 09:01.020]  The roots of the Mac do not seem to go as deep as my other plants.
[09:01.020 --> 09:04.100]  The Mac is in the same size pot as all of my other plants.
[09:04.100 --> 09:07.740]  All the plants in this room are in a seven-gallon pot.
[09:07.740 --> 09:11.460]  All of those plants are filling the pot with roots.
[09:11.460 --> 09:17.900]  The Mac has got a really thick layer of roots, very shallow in the top of the pot.
[09:17.900 --> 09:22.360]  The roots do not appear to be going down and around like most plants.
[09:22.360 --> 09:27.420]  It looks more like they have made a rug or a welcome mat in the first few inches of that
[09:27.420 --> 09:28.420]  pot.
[09:28.420 --> 09:32.420]  They have gone really wide all the way to the edges of the pot, and then they work themselves
[09:32.420 --> 09:33.980]  back and they have woven.
[09:33.980 --> 09:37.500]  The best way I can describe it is like a little welcome mat that you'd put right in front
[09:37.500 --> 09:39.500]  of the door that you rub your feet on.
[09:39.540 --> 09:42.020]  It looks just like that in this pot.
[09:42.020 --> 09:46.580]  Most of the time, we get roots that go down and then they wrap around the outside of the
[09:46.580 --> 09:47.700]  pot.
[09:47.700 --> 09:52.500]  This top of this pot is completely filled with roots, and most of the bottom still has
[09:52.500 --> 09:54.580]  plenty of root space.
[09:54.580 --> 10:01.540]  It looks to me, from my experience, that the Mac has a preference of wider root space instead
[10:01.540 --> 10:03.340]  of a deeper root space.
[10:03.340 --> 10:07.900]  If you're working with the Mac, that may be something that may help your grow.
[10:07.900 --> 10:10.620]  Maybe put it in a bed instead of a deep pot.
[10:10.620 --> 10:12.420]  That could improve your outcome.
[10:12.420 --> 10:16.900]  Now, keep in mind, I do not have a lot of experience with the Mac.
[10:16.900 --> 10:21.180]  We have not developed a very solid relationship yet, but I do have her in flower.
[10:21.180 --> 10:22.780]  I've got one in another area.
[10:22.780 --> 10:23.860]  I've cut clones.
[10:23.860 --> 10:25.640]  I figured out how to get the clones rooted.
[10:25.640 --> 10:28.620]  I've got some very happy-looking veg plants.
[10:28.620 --> 10:33.100]  I've also got a couple of pretty pissed-off-looking veg plants because I am feeding them different
[10:33.100 --> 10:37.980]  things and trying to figure out how they respond to different feeds and just different
[10:37.980 --> 10:38.980]  treatment.
[10:38.980 --> 10:45.260]  Again, the most noticeable thing I see in the Mac is it seems to prefer a wider root
[10:45.260 --> 10:47.940]  space instead of a deeper root space.
[10:47.940 --> 10:52.380]  So, if you've got a wider pot as opposed to a deeper pot, that would be the way to go
[10:52.380 --> 10:54.100]  with the Mac.
[10:54.100 --> 11:00.140]  Over time, I have also learned to give the Mac longer wet and dry cycles.
[11:00.140 --> 11:03.180]  Let me try to explain that a little bit better.
[11:03.180 --> 11:06.260]  Most of my veg plants are in a 3-gallon pot.
[11:06.260 --> 11:11.820]  If I water all of them with approximately 3 quarters of a gallon of water on Monday,
[11:11.820 --> 11:16.340]  those plants will need the same amount of water again on Wednesday, and everything will
[11:16.340 --> 11:17.340]  be happy.
[11:17.340 --> 11:22.260]  Now, if you've listened to my 1-5 Water Tech podcast, this description will make better
[11:22.260 --> 11:23.340]  sense.
[11:23.340 --> 11:27.500]  When I water most of my plants, I will get them to a 4.
[11:27.500 --> 11:32.060]  Monday morning, I will water them until they are saturated to what I consider to be level
[11:32.060 --> 11:33.060]  4.
[11:33.060 --> 11:35.820]  So, they will last all of Monday around that level 4.
[11:35.820 --> 11:37.020]  They'll start drying out.
[11:37.020 --> 11:38.540]  Tuesday, we'll get to level 3.
[11:38.540 --> 11:42.940]  By the time I get to the plants Wednesday morning, they're just getting to level 2,
[11:42.940 --> 11:44.100]  and it's time to water them.
[11:44.100 --> 11:48.300]  So, I give them some water, and they're good Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
[11:48.300 --> 11:50.300]  Then we repeat the process.
[11:50.300 --> 11:56.220]  In most cases, I will water my plants to a 4 and let them cycle until they get to a 2,
[11:56.220 --> 11:58.740]  and they will show me that that is what they want.
[11:58.740 --> 12:00.180]  The plants will grow with vigor.
[12:00.180 --> 12:01.980]  They'll eat the nutrients I provide them.
[12:01.980 --> 12:03.540]  I won't see stagnant growth.
[12:03.540 --> 12:04.900]  I won't see green leaves.
[12:04.900 --> 12:07.140]  I won't see nutrient deficiencies.
[12:07.140 --> 12:08.780]  I won't see any problems.
[12:08.780 --> 12:11.580]  Now, let's talk about the Mac.
[12:11.580 --> 12:17.580]  I have learned that if I water the Mac at a level 5 and just soak the shit out of it
[12:17.580 --> 12:19.780]  to where you would be worried about most plants, you'd say,
[12:19.780 --> 12:20.980]  Bro, that's too much water.
[12:20.980 --> 12:22.300]  She's going to die.
[12:22.300 --> 12:26.060]  I just water the shit out of it, and that plant really seems to love it.
[12:26.060 --> 12:31.340]  Then I don't give that plant water again until it's about a 1.5, and it is just starting
[12:31.340 --> 12:32.340]  to get droopy.
[12:32.340 --> 12:36.700]  It says, Hey, bro, if you don't water me pretty soon, I'm going to look like shit.
[12:36.700 --> 12:41.660]  Then I water that plant full on to level 5 until I'm getting a bunch of runoff, until
[12:41.660 --> 12:44.540]  my pot is soaked and heavy and saturated.
[12:44.540 --> 12:49.140]  I don't have to water that plant for probably 5 or 6 more days in that 3-gallon pot, and
[12:49.140 --> 12:51.620]  it is completely happy.
[12:51.620 --> 12:53.380]  The Mac is a very unique plant.
[12:53.380 --> 12:58.180]  It took me a couple of weeks and a few plants to figure out how to get her happy.
[12:58.180 --> 13:04.820]  What I have discovered is a lower pH, a little bit extra cow mag, and a wider pot as opposed
[13:04.820 --> 13:10.780]  to a tall pot really seem to make the Mac plants happier than any other things I have
[13:10.780 --> 13:11.780]  tried.
[13:11.780 --> 13:16.900]  Now, one of the things that inspired me to really soak the plant was the fact that Jaren
[13:16.900 --> 13:20.940]  grows the Mac in hydro, and it is phenomenal.
[13:20.940 --> 13:23.180]  So I thought, it likes a lot of water.
[13:23.180 --> 13:25.660]  Let's see what happens when I overwater this bitch.
[13:25.660 --> 13:26.660]  And guess what?
[13:26.660 --> 13:32.020]  She went nuts, which is really weird because most of the time, a plant with OG Kush type
[13:32.020 --> 13:35.780]  of genetics in it, they really do not like an overwatering.
[13:35.780 --> 13:41.380]  So any other OG Kush type of plant, be very careful with overwatering that fucker because
[13:41.380 --> 13:42.620]  you may drown it.
[13:42.620 --> 13:47.540]  I've seen more people kill a Kush plant by overwatering than underwatering.
[13:47.540 --> 13:49.500]  So that is something you're going to have to learn.
[13:49.500 --> 13:50.780]  You'll have to dial it in.
[13:50.900 --> 13:56.420]  This is very plant specific, and the Mac is a very good example of a plant we need to
[13:56.420 --> 14:02.500]  dial in and establish a relationship with if we want her to reach her full potential.
[14:02.500 --> 14:05.980]  Many people are going to grow the Mac and they're going to give up.
[14:05.980 --> 14:08.340]  They're going to say, it didn't give me enough flower.
[14:08.340 --> 14:09.980]  It didn't give me good enough flower.
[14:09.980 --> 14:12.020]  It didn't do what I expected.
[14:12.020 --> 14:13.100]  That's just fine.
[14:13.100 --> 14:14.880]  You guys go ahead and tap out.
[14:14.880 --> 14:20.260]  It's going to take a few dedicated, passionate growers to spend a couple of grows with her
[14:20.260 --> 14:23.140]  and learn exactly what she needs.
[14:23.140 --> 14:27.480]  And she will fucking shine for the growers who spend some time doing that.
[14:27.480 --> 14:30.740]  So if you're looking for something that's real easy, that's just going to put out weight
[14:30.740 --> 14:34.900]  and trichomes and grow amazingly for you, the Mac is not the one.
[14:34.900 --> 14:39.380]  But if you've got some time to dedicate and pay attention and commit to a plant and really
[14:39.380 --> 14:45.980]  dial something in and grow high quality connoisseur grade cannabis, the Mac would be a fun cut
[14:45.980 --> 14:46.980]  for you to work with.
[14:46.980 --> 14:47.980]  All right.
[14:47.980 --> 14:48.980]  Holy shit.
[14:48.980 --> 14:49.980]  That was a long rant about the Mac.
[14:50.700 --> 14:51.700]  I can't even breed that one.
[14:51.700 --> 14:53.900]  I'm over here hyping up somebody else's strain, but I've been growing it for a minute.
[14:53.900 --> 14:55.580]  I've noticed a lot of people are growing it.
[14:55.580 --> 14:57.660]  A lot of people are frustrated.
[14:57.660 --> 15:03.020]  I wouldn't be doing the cannabis world a service if I did not help you grow the Mac to its
[15:03.020 --> 15:04.020]  full potential.
[15:04.020 --> 15:09.020]  So big shout out to, first of all, big shout out to Capulator for breeding the Mac.
[15:09.020 --> 15:14.100]  Big shout out to my buddy, Jaren, for sharing his grow style and some accidentally sharing
[15:14.100 --> 15:15.940]  some tips on growing the Mac.
[15:15.940 --> 15:20.780]  And I also owe a shout out to the people who have made sure I had the Mac in my garden.
[15:20.780 --> 15:25.180]  Two of my very good friends reached out to me and gave me clones of the Mac.
[15:25.180 --> 15:28.660]  I don't want to say their names on the show because I know if I do, everybody is going
[15:28.660 --> 15:32.500]  to go and ask them for a clone, but they know who they are.
[15:32.500 --> 15:34.940]  They know that I've got nothing but love and respect for them.
[15:34.940 --> 15:37.100]  So big fist bump, big thank you.
[15:37.100 --> 15:41.340]  And when the seeds are ready, they definitely get a couple of those seeds.
[15:41.340 --> 15:42.340]  That's how it works.
[15:42.340 --> 15:46.180]  If you give me a clone and I pollinate it and I breed to it, you get some of the seeds
[15:46.180 --> 15:47.300]  that come out of it.
[15:47.300 --> 15:48.460]  That is called karma.
[15:48.460 --> 15:50.380]  That's called looking out for one another.
[15:50.380 --> 15:52.300]  That's just called being a good fucking person.
[15:52.300 --> 15:53.300]  All right.
[15:53.300 --> 15:54.940]  Let's talk about what else is in that room.
[15:54.940 --> 15:58.540]  I obviously pollinated the Mac and I'm super excited about that.
[15:58.540 --> 16:04.020]  I also put the GMO in the room to be pollinated by the Mac.
[16:04.020 --> 16:05.740]  A lot of people love the GMO.
[16:05.740 --> 16:08.180]  A lot of people say the GMO is just hype.
[16:08.180 --> 16:15.300]  Lately, I've been loving that savory garlic mashed potato terp that the GMO puts out.
[16:15.300 --> 16:21.140]  So if I can grow something that smells like garlic and mashed potatoes and deliciousness,
[16:21.140 --> 16:23.940]  trust me, I'm going to grow it and I'm going to breed with it.
[16:23.940 --> 16:28.140]  So I've recently pollinated the GMO with a rise pollen.
[16:28.140 --> 16:30.220]  That'll be a great cross in my opinion.
[16:30.220 --> 16:32.660]  And I have also pollinated the do-si-do.
[16:32.660 --> 16:38.540]  So we've got the Mac, we've got GMO, and we've got do-si-do, all pollinated, all filled
[16:38.540 --> 16:39.540]  with seeds.
[16:39.540 --> 16:41.500]  The Mac, I do not plan to release.
[16:41.500 --> 16:45.580]  The do-si-do may be released depending on how the testing goes.
[16:45.580 --> 16:49.460]  The GMO may be released depending on how that testing goes.
[16:49.460 --> 16:50.620]  Keep your eyes open.
[16:50.620 --> 16:51.620]  Keep your ears open.
[16:51.620 --> 16:53.020]  I will keep you updated.
[16:53.020 --> 16:58.500]  Again, those have at least 20 to 30 days to finish flowering before I can even harvest
[16:58.500 --> 16:59.820]  the seeds.
[16:59.820 --> 17:02.020]  But that's what's going on in my breeding room.
[17:02.020 --> 17:03.020]  Just thought I would share.
[17:03.020 --> 17:08.620]  I know a lot of people enjoy the updates and the insight into my grow space.
[17:08.620 --> 17:12.460]  Now I've got one more quick note to get to before I jump into the email portion of the
[17:12.460 --> 17:13.460]  show.
[17:13.460 --> 17:15.020]  This one says lots of emails.
[17:15.020 --> 17:18.920]  I got an email recently from somebody who says, hey, Rasta Jeff, you keep asking for
[17:18.920 --> 17:20.260]  emails on the show.
[17:20.260 --> 17:25.260]  I've emailed you two or three times and you have not read my message on the show.
[17:25.260 --> 17:27.580]  Basically saying, what the fuck is up with that?
[17:27.580 --> 17:28.660]  I apologize.
[17:28.700 --> 17:32.140]  I have got a large stack of emails.
[17:32.140 --> 17:35.300]  I have probably got 25 printed emails here in front of me.
[17:35.300 --> 17:37.980]  I'm only going to read two or three of them on the show.
[17:37.980 --> 17:42.500]  It is nothing against you personally if I do not read your email on the show.
[17:42.500 --> 17:43.500]  There's only so much time.
[17:43.500 --> 17:45.420]  I only have so much voice.
[17:45.420 --> 17:47.260]  I only put out so many episodes.
[17:47.260 --> 17:49.020]  I will get to your email.
[17:49.020 --> 17:51.180]  Don't feel discouraged.
[17:51.180 --> 17:56.220]  Sometimes I am working your email and another person's email into the same show.
[17:56.220 --> 17:58.500]  Sometimes it's on the schedule and it's coming up.
[17:59.340 --> 18:00.340]  You just got to be patient.
[18:00.340 --> 18:04.860]  Please do not take it personally if I do not read your email on the show.
[18:04.860 --> 18:11.220]  However, if you have contributed to Patreon, part of my promise to my Patreon contributors
[18:11.220 --> 18:15.580]  is that I will read your email on the show on the next episode.
[18:15.580 --> 18:20.740]  If you are a Patreon contributor and I have not read your email, please email me back
[18:20.740 --> 18:25.940]  with the word Patreon in the subject line and I will make sure to get your emails at
[18:25.940 --> 18:27.300]  the top of the pile.
[18:27.300 --> 18:29.940]  I do like to fulfill and complete my promises.
[18:29.940 --> 18:35.100]  So if I owe you something, please remind me and I will make sure to get that to you as
[18:35.100 --> 18:36.540]  soon as possible.
[18:36.540 --> 18:39.340]  But please, everybody else, do not feel discouraged.
[18:39.340 --> 18:40.660]  I will get to your email.
[18:40.660 --> 18:43.060]  I have got a lot of them to answer.
[18:43.060 --> 18:46.420]  I'm not skipping your email because of anything personal.
[18:46.420 --> 18:47.660]  It is just timing.
[18:47.660 --> 18:49.500]  It is subjective.
[18:49.500 --> 18:53.220]  Maybe today I want to talk about terps and your email is about microbes.
[18:53.220 --> 18:56.140]  Maybe I want to talk about microbes and your email is about terps.
[18:56.140 --> 18:59.700]  It all just has to do with what I want to talk about today, what other people are talking
[18:59.700 --> 19:01.820]  about, what else is going on in my life or the world.
[19:01.820 --> 19:03.220]  It's nothing personal.
[19:03.220 --> 19:04.780]  It's just the luck of the draw.
[19:04.780 --> 19:08.060]  It's just how the emails are stacked up in my pile.
[19:08.060 --> 19:11.620]  And with that being said, please do not stop sending the emails.
[19:11.620 --> 19:15.700]  If I get a great email question and I really like it and it stands out, it may just go
[19:15.700 --> 19:16.820]  first.
[19:16.820 --> 19:18.820]  That's the beauty of having my own podcast.
[19:18.820 --> 19:21.300]  I get to pick and choose which email goes first.
[19:21.300 --> 19:23.220]  All right, that's enough of that.
[19:23.300 --> 19:27.380]  Speaking of all these emails, let's get right to these two emails that are here on top of
[19:27.380 --> 19:28.380]  my pile.
[19:28.380 --> 19:34.220]  A couple of weeks ago, I talked about a piece of equipment called the PL Grow Minder Unit.
[19:34.220 --> 19:38.780]  The PL Grow Minder Unit is a device that hangs in your grow room and it pays attention to
[19:38.780 --> 19:43.180]  the temperature and the humidity and several other parameters in your grow room.
[19:43.180 --> 19:49.460]  It links up to your smartphone or other wireless device and you are able to log in and view
[19:49.500 --> 19:54.740]  the conditions of your grow room from anywhere on the planet as long as you have got internet
[19:54.740 --> 19:56.260]  access.
[19:56.260 --> 20:01.740]  I really like the peace of mind of having a grow room monitor in my grow room.
[20:01.740 --> 20:06.580]  I can open up my phone, I can log into a website and I can see the temperature, I can see the
[20:06.580 --> 20:12.180]  humidity, I can see the VPD and I can also see the temperature of my reservoir on one
[20:12.180 --> 20:15.340]  screen just by logging in to a quick website.
[20:15.340 --> 20:18.460]  I can find that information from anywhere.
[20:18.460 --> 20:22.240]  So if I know that, hey, it's been hot today, I wonder if that air conditioner cycled on
[20:22.240 --> 20:23.860]  at noon like it's supposed to.
[20:23.860 --> 20:28.060]  I can open up my phone and go bleep and it'll show me, yeah, it's 74 degrees in the grow
[20:28.060 --> 20:29.060]  room.
[20:29.060 --> 20:30.340]  That air conditioner did cycle on.
[20:30.340 --> 20:31.660]  I don't have to worry about anything.
[20:31.660 --> 20:33.200]  I can enjoy my day.
[20:33.200 --> 20:38.020]  So I really enjoy having a grow room monitor just for peace of mind.
[20:38.020 --> 20:40.060]  It also does logging.
[20:40.060 --> 20:46.100]  It will keep days and weeks and months worth of data backed up so you can look at a chart
[20:46.180 --> 20:52.620]  and see how is my humidity, how is my temperature for several days and it really helps you to
[20:52.620 --> 20:55.380]  identify and solve problems.
[20:55.380 --> 20:58.300]  If something goes wrong, you can say that happened about two weeks ago.
[20:58.300 --> 21:00.500]  Hopefully you were taking notes on what you fed.
[21:00.500 --> 21:01.780]  You can look at your feed chart.
[21:01.780 --> 21:03.540]  What did I feed two weeks ago?
[21:03.540 --> 21:07.380]  Then you can go back and you can look at your VPD chart two weeks ago and you can say, ah
[21:07.380 --> 21:08.620]  shit, look right here.
[21:08.620 --> 21:13.380]  We started getting weird spikes and you can see right here, we started getting weird dips
[21:13.540 --> 21:16.980]  and those may have something to do with the problems in your grow.
[21:16.980 --> 21:22.500]  So I really find it beneficial to have a quality grow room monitor.
[21:22.500 --> 21:27.700]  Now with all of the technology involved, of course, somebody out there had to be paranoid
[21:27.700 --> 21:31.420]  about the technology involved in the PL unit.
[21:31.420 --> 21:32.920]  I understand.
[21:32.920 --> 21:37.820]  Every group of friends has that one guy who is a paranoid conspiracy theorist and he's
[21:37.820 --> 21:39.640]  always welcome in my group.
[21:39.640 --> 21:43.920]  So we got an email from that member of the group and it goes a lot like this.
[21:43.920 --> 21:45.480]  It says, good morning Rasta Jeff.
[21:45.480 --> 21:51.100]  I just listened to your grow from your heart podcast, which discussed the PNL grow system
[21:51.100 --> 21:53.120]  monitoring device.
[21:53.120 --> 21:57.900]  What about your listeners who don't live in such cannabis friendly communities as yours?
[21:57.900 --> 22:00.340]  Is the monitoring device safe?
[22:00.340 --> 22:03.040]  Will it record your location?
[22:03.040 --> 22:06.880]  I could just be old and paranoid, but it scares the hell out of me.
[22:06.880 --> 22:10.640]  I checked out the website and the unit looks fantastic.
[22:10.640 --> 22:15.380]  They say they're safe and they don't record any info, but what about third party listening
[22:15.380 --> 22:16.380]  in?
[22:16.380 --> 22:22.480]  The digital footprint is scary and I am scared, but thanks for all you do, signed, Willie's
[22:22.480 --> 22:23.480]  armpit.
[22:23.480 --> 22:26.120]  And then he did follow that up with a second email.
[22:26.120 --> 22:27.120]  Let's just get right to it.
[22:27.120 --> 22:28.600]  It says, good afternoon Rasta Jeff.
[22:28.600 --> 22:34.040]  I emailed you this morning about using the PNL monitoring system and my paranoia.
[22:34.040 --> 22:39.000]  I forgot to mention I'm also even too paranoid to sign up for cannabis.
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.880]  If you guys have been listening to the show, you know that cannabis is a cannabis friendly
[22:42.880 --> 22:44.680]  social media application.
[22:44.680 --> 22:48.200]  Make sure you check out cannabis on your Android or Apple device.
[22:48.200 --> 22:49.200]  Give me a follow.
[22:49.200 --> 22:51.340]  I'm Irie underscore genetics on cannabis.
[22:51.340 --> 22:53.040]  I look forward to seeing you there.
[22:53.040 --> 22:57.320]  The email goes on to say, will you please tell me if I should get with the times, drop
[22:57.320 --> 23:01.400]  the paranoia and join the party, or should I be afraid?
[23:01.400 --> 23:06.520]  Sending these emails even freaks me out, but I trust your opinion and truthfulness.
[23:06.520 --> 23:08.960]  Thanks again from Willie's armpit.
[23:08.960 --> 23:11.760]  All right, there's a lot to unwrap there.
[23:11.760 --> 23:13.840]  Willie's armpit is paranoid.
[23:13.840 --> 23:17.800]  He's afraid to get in trouble by using the PL grow monitor unit.
[23:17.800 --> 23:23.720]  He's also afraid to get himself in trouble by using the cannabis social media application.
[23:23.720 --> 23:29.800]  I do understand being paranoid or apprehensive to show off your grow on the internet.
[23:29.800 --> 23:33.200]  Let's talk about the cannabis question first.
[23:33.200 --> 23:37.040]  Cannabis does not sell or trade or give away any of your information.
[23:37.040 --> 23:38.960]  They do not save any of your information.
[23:38.960 --> 23:41.240]  I've spoken with Q about this a couple of times.
[23:41.240 --> 23:44.240]  He's also been interviewed on a couple of other shows.
[23:44.240 --> 23:46.120]  They do not want your information.
[23:46.120 --> 23:49.240]  They simply want you to be a part of the community.
[23:49.240 --> 23:55.080]  Now if you are worried about posting your cannabis material, your cannabis photos, there
[23:55.080 --> 23:58.520]  are ways to disguise your IP address.
[23:58.520 --> 24:01.120]  There are applications you can download for your phone.
[24:01.120 --> 24:05.520]  You download the application, you open that application first, then you do all of your
[24:05.520 --> 24:10.680]  normal posting and browsing, and it makes it look like your phone is in another location.
[24:10.680 --> 24:15.640]  If you are interested in posting to cannabis and you are still too paranoid, that is one
[24:15.640 --> 24:16.840]  suggestion.
[24:16.840 --> 24:18.920]  Use a fake VPN.
[24:18.920 --> 24:22.920]  It is very affordable, it is very easy, and it is very safe and effective.
[24:22.920 --> 24:27.240]  So if you're in a prohibition state and you'd like to participate in some social media and
[24:27.240 --> 24:29.840]  post your cannabis photos, that is the way to do it.
[24:29.840 --> 24:33.480]  You get an application, you can do the same thing on your computer, you can do the same
[24:33.480 --> 24:35.360]  thing on your Android or iPhone.
[24:35.360 --> 24:38.640]  You get an application, you download that, you go through that one first.
[24:38.640 --> 24:41.440]  It makes all the other applications think you're in Russia.
[24:41.440 --> 24:44.520]  So that way, if they say, well, where is this guy posting these weed pics?
[24:44.520 --> 24:46.280]  It says you're in fucking Russia.
[24:46.280 --> 24:47.280]  Nobody cares.
[24:47.280 --> 24:48.280]  They're not going to go there.
[24:48.280 --> 24:53.320]  Now my second thought around the cannabis paranoia is that unless you make a mistake,
[24:53.320 --> 24:58.960]  unless you do something stupid, I don't think that they are looking to cause trouble and
[24:58.960 --> 25:01.100]  arrest people through cannabis.
[25:01.100 --> 25:05.460]  There are many other avenues to find criminals.
[25:05.460 --> 25:09.600]  Unless you're doing some illegal transactions or some kind of bullshit on cannabis, you
[25:09.600 --> 25:11.080]  should be safe.
[25:11.080 --> 25:12.600]  Notice I said should.
[25:12.600 --> 25:18.120]  I am not a computer crimes or an internet technologies expert in any way.
[25:18.120 --> 25:20.920]  I type with two fingers going peck, peck, peck.
[25:20.920 --> 25:26.280]  So I am not the guy to get computer advice from, but I don't think they're worried about
[25:26.280 --> 25:30.080]  small time growers posting a couple of plants on cannabis.
[25:30.080 --> 25:31.400]  I don't know where you are.
[25:31.400 --> 25:32.800]  I don't know your location.
[25:32.800 --> 25:34.080]  I don't know your demographic.
[25:34.080 --> 25:35.280]  I don't know the rules.
[25:35.280 --> 25:39.280]  I don't know how big of a deal it is where you are, but I don't think cannabis will be
[25:39.280 --> 25:40.280]  your downfall.
[25:40.280 --> 25:43.120]  Again, if you're super paranoid, just don't do it.
[25:43.120 --> 25:47.960]  If you really want to do it, get away to mask your IP, then join us there.
[25:47.960 --> 25:53.880]  Don't put anything that would identify your location or who you are in any of your photos.
[25:53.880 --> 25:56.920]  If you're going to put plants in the photos, put plants in the photos.
[25:56.920 --> 26:01.640]  Make sure that none of your identifying personal documents or belongings or buildings or anything
[26:01.640 --> 26:03.560]  like that are behind you.
[26:03.560 --> 26:05.800]  Pay attention to what is in the background of your photos.
[26:05.800 --> 26:10.720]  If you post a picture and it's got a building in the background and it says whatever Denver
[26:10.720 --> 26:15.740]  City Library, then we all know that you live right by the Denver City Library.
[26:15.740 --> 26:16.800]  Don't do shit like that.
[26:16.800 --> 26:17.800]  Keep yourself safe.
[26:17.840 --> 26:20.080]  Be extra careful with your posts.
[26:20.080 --> 26:25.240]  Now let's move forward and talk about the PL Grow Minder Paranoia.
[26:25.240 --> 26:27.800]  I did reach out to my friends at PL Grow.
[26:27.800 --> 26:31.800]  I said, hey, I've got a friend who has some questions, who has some concerns, and they
[26:31.800 --> 26:33.760]  sent me a statement.
[26:33.760 --> 26:41.040]  It says, we at PL Grow Systems take privacy seriously and we respect the privacy of our
[26:41.040 --> 26:42.280]  customers.
[26:42.280 --> 26:48.040]  We do not request or store any personal identifiable information.
[26:48.040 --> 26:54.400]  All we do require is an email address and a username so users can log in and receive
[26:54.400 --> 26:56.040]  alerts.
[26:56.040 --> 27:00.520]  Information is stored, encrypted, and all data that is transmitted to and stored in
[27:00.520 --> 27:03.760]  our secure cloud platform is anonymized.
[27:03.760 --> 27:09.400]  Clients, sensor, and journal data is not sold to third parties.
[27:09.400 --> 27:16.000]  We use the data internally in our own analytics to provide our clients with a high value service.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.320]  And then they actually give me an email address.
[27:18.320 --> 27:27.120]  Please direct any questions you have on this or related matters to info at PLGrow.systems.
[27:27.120 --> 27:29.620]  And then they signed it from Pete.
[27:29.620 --> 27:32.080]  And that is the P from PNL Grow Systems.
[27:32.080 --> 27:38.000]  So when you reach out to PNL, you will probably get P or L responding to your email.
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.400]  So let's touch on what they said here.
[27:40.400 --> 27:42.080]  Just cover it real quickly.
[27:42.080 --> 27:46.360]  They take privacy seriously and they respect our privacy.
[27:46.360 --> 27:51.000]  All that they request is a username and an email address.
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.760]  Nobody says you have to use your real name for that username.
[27:54.760 --> 27:56.480]  You can just make up a name.
[27:56.480 --> 27:59.960]  Bottle of Frosty Cold Dr. Pepper could be your username.
[27:59.960 --> 28:02.640]  Dr. Pepper could be your login info.
[28:02.640 --> 28:03.880]  It could be that easy.
[28:03.880 --> 28:05.860]  You can stay anonymous that way.
[28:05.860 --> 28:10.180]  Then they also assure us that none of the information is sold and that all of the information
[28:10.180 --> 28:15.300]  is only used to help improve the PLGrow system.
[28:15.300 --> 28:17.580]  So it sounds like they have thought about this.
[28:17.580 --> 28:22.180]  They are not interested in your information, nor are they interested in gathering your
[28:22.180 --> 28:25.040]  information to sell it to a third party.
[28:25.040 --> 28:28.540]  And also PLGrow Systems is in another country.
[28:28.540 --> 28:31.420]  So that puts another layer of legal protection.
[28:31.420 --> 28:36.860]  If some government official did want that information, they would have to get that information
[28:36.860 --> 28:39.260]  from our friends in another country.
[28:39.260 --> 28:42.980]  So that actually provides another layer of security there.
[28:42.980 --> 28:50.300]  So I assure you that our friends at PLGrow do not want to steal or pirate your information.
[28:50.300 --> 28:52.460]  It will not be sold to anybody.
[28:52.460 --> 28:56.840]  And also P&L Grow Systems does not keep your location information for any reason.
[28:56.840 --> 28:58.180]  They don't know where you are.
[28:58.180 --> 29:03.180]  The only information that PLGrow Systems has is your email address so they can send you
[29:03.180 --> 29:05.180]  notifications from your device.
[29:05.180 --> 29:08.900]  They've got your login information, once again, so you can log in and they can send you the
[29:08.900 --> 29:09.900]  information.
[29:09.900 --> 29:14.740]  Then the only other details they know are the temperature, the VPD, the humidity of
[29:14.740 --> 29:19.300]  your grow room, and potentially the temperature of the water in your reservoir if you were
[29:19.300 --> 29:21.820]  using the water temperature sensor.
[29:21.820 --> 29:23.960]  Those are the only things they will know about you.
[29:23.960 --> 29:26.100]  Those are the only things that they are concerned with.
[29:26.100 --> 29:31.860]  Again, any information that they do receive from your unit will only be used to improve
[29:31.860 --> 29:35.380]  the quality of the PLGrow monitoring system.
[29:35.380 --> 29:38.340]  So rest assured, you guys, they don't want to steal your info.
[29:38.340 --> 29:40.340]  They have no use for your info.
[29:40.340 --> 29:42.340]  They're not going to pass it on to a third party.
[29:42.340 --> 29:44.140]  You can use the equipment in confidence.
[29:44.140 --> 29:46.740]  I use it in multiple environments.
[29:46.740 --> 29:48.340]  I use it in my personal grow.
[29:48.340 --> 29:50.540]  I use it in caregiver grows.
[29:50.540 --> 29:52.640]  I use it in commercial facilities.
[29:52.640 --> 29:54.900]  I've recommended it to several friends.
[29:54.900 --> 29:56.220]  I have no fear.
[29:56.220 --> 29:59.040]  And if I'm using it, you should use it with no fear.
[29:59.040 --> 30:03.420]  This was not supposed to be a Mac commercial, nor was this supposed to be a PLGrowMinder
[30:03.420 --> 30:04.420]  unit commercial.
[30:04.420 --> 30:05.820]  It kind of turned into both of those.
[30:05.820 --> 30:07.780]  I hope you guys enjoyed the podcast.
[30:07.780 --> 30:09.380]  This was a great Thursday episode.
[30:09.380 --> 30:12.340]  I'm going to wrap it up right here because my throat is starting to burn out.
[30:12.340 --> 30:14.340]  I want to thank everybody for listening to the podcast.
[30:14.340 --> 30:16.920]  I want to thank my friends at PLGrowSystems.
[30:16.920 --> 30:19.940]  Make sure you check them out at PLGrow.Systems.
[30:19.940 --> 30:28.140]  Also make sure you use coupon code GFYH25, and that will get you 25% off your PLGrowMinder
[30:28.140 --> 30:29.140]  unit.
[30:29.140 --> 30:32.380]  That also lets them know that you learned about them through the Grow From Your Heart
[30:32.380 --> 30:34.820]  podcast, so help everybody out.
[30:34.820 --> 30:38.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you feel like this podcast was educational, informative, and

[31:29.660 --> 31:31.700]  nonsense, you can send me an email.

[31:37.420 --> 31:39.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is all I've got for you for this episode.
[31:39.620 --> 31:43.820]  I want to give a huge shout out to my buddy, Shore Bud, and until next time, take a fat
[31:43.820 --> 31:45.740]  dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[31:46.700 --> 31:50.140]  I started this song without any words
[31:50.140 --> 31:53.820]  I got so high, I scratched till I bled
[31:53.820 --> 31:57.500]  Love myself better than you
[31:57.500 --> 32:01.020]  Know it's wrong, so what should I do?
[32:01.020 --> 32:04.620]  The finest day that I've ever had
[32:04.620 --> 32:17.490]  You know it's wrong, so what should I do?
[32:17.490 --> 32:19.490]  I'm on a plane
[32:20.290 --> 32:22.290]  I can't complain
[32:24.290 --> 32:26.290]  I'm on a plane
[32:32.960 --> 32:34.960]  For a night, it's safe to say
[32:34.960 --> 32:36.960]  I'm a crony on my
[32:36.960 --> 32:40.960]  Love myself better than you
[32:40.960 --> 32:44.960]  Know it's wrong, so what should I do?
[32:44.960 --> 32:46.960]  Black she had got, blackmailed again
[32:46.960 --> 32:50.960]  Forgot to put the opposite cone
[32:50.960 --> 32:54.230]  Love my better than you
[32:55.030 --> 32:59.030]  Know it's wrong, so what should I do?
[33:05.000 --> 33:07.000]  I can't complain
[33:07.000 --> 33:10.470]  I'm on a plane
[33:14.000 --> 33:18.000]  Somewhere I have heard this before
[33:18.000 --> 33:40.170]  It felt so new to me
[33:40.970 --> 33:44.970]  It is not time to make it unclear
[33:44.970 --> 33:48.970]  To write off lies that don't make sense
[33:48.970 --> 33:55.400]  Love you, know it's wrong, so what should I do?
[33:55.400 --> 34:02.010]  One more special message, and I can go home
[34:02.010 --> 34:04.010]  Love better than you
[34:04.010 --> 34:09.540]  Know it's wrong, so what should I do?
[34:11.540 --> 34:13.540]  I'm on a plane
[34:13.540 --> 34:16.880]  Can't complain
[34:17.680 --> 34:19.680]  I'm on a plane
[34:21.680 --> 34:23.680]  I can't complain
