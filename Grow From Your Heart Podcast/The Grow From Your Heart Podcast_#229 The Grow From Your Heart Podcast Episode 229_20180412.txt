[00:15.230 --> 00:17.950]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:17.950 --> 00:20.030]  It's time for episode number 229
[00:20.030 --> 00:21.850]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:21.850 --> 00:25.390]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.390 --> 00:26.530]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:26.530 --> 00:27.830]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.830 --> 00:30.190]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:30.190 --> 00:31.510]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:31.510 --> 00:33.030]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:33.030 --> 00:34.870]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.870 --> 00:37.910]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.910 --> 00:39.870]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.870 --> 00:41.790]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:41.790 --> 00:44.110]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:44.110 --> 00:45.710]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:45.710 --> 00:48.030]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.030 --> 00:52.090]  Big shout out to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.630 --> 00:55.870]  I hope everybody's having a great evening.
[00:55.870 --> 00:59.110]  I hope you are as dabbed out as I am right now.
[00:59.110 --> 01:00.990]  I am smoking on some, what am I smoking?
[01:00.990 --> 01:02.590]  Let me grab the label, because I keep messing this up.
[01:02.590 --> 01:05.990]  This is called Screamin' Tangerines, and it is delicious.
[01:05.990 --> 01:07.370]  I've been smoking the Screamin' Tangerines
[01:07.370 --> 01:08.950]  for the past couple of days.
[01:08.950 --> 01:12.070]  It's got a really nice orange candy sort of a flavor
[01:12.070 --> 01:14.510]  and a really nice sativa head buzz.
[01:14.510 --> 01:16.990]  Every time I open a container, it just smells like
[01:16.990 --> 01:18.950]  an orange candy or an orange creamsicle
[01:18.950 --> 01:20.030]  or something like that.
[01:20.030 --> 01:23.070]  Really digging the flavor of the Screamin' Tangerines.
[01:23.070 --> 01:27.590]  Also, I usually prefer candy flavored dabs
[01:27.590 --> 01:31.030]  like Tangy or Tangerines, or of course the Lemon Jeffrey,
[01:31.030 --> 01:33.830]  or maybe the Strawberry Icy I had a couple of weeks ago.
[01:33.830 --> 01:35.790]  The Clementine is always delicious.
[01:35.790 --> 01:38.310]  I prefer that candy flavored sort of dab thing,
[01:38.310 --> 01:40.310]  and I've also noticed that the candy flavors
[01:40.310 --> 01:43.270]  are quite often the sativas that give me that nice head buzz
[01:43.270 --> 01:44.110]  that I'm looking for.
[01:44.110 --> 01:47.470]  So when I go for a dab, I usually prefer the Tangy,
[01:47.470 --> 01:50.150]  the Screamin' Tangerine, Lemon Jeffrey,
[01:50.150 --> 01:51.870]  anything with that candy sort of flavor.
[01:51.870 --> 01:54.230]  That's usually my favorite sort of dabs to go for.
[01:54.230 --> 01:57.510]  But I was at the dispensary a few days ago,
[01:57.510 --> 02:00.630]  and they had some Gorilla Glue Live Batter,
[02:00.630 --> 02:02.390]  and something about the smell of it,
[02:02.390 --> 02:05.270]  I'm smelling it right now, just really drew me in.
[02:05.270 --> 02:09.870]  I prefer my flowers to be the cushy, diesel-y kind of smell,
[02:09.870 --> 02:11.750]  and my dabs, of course, to be the candy.
[02:11.750 --> 02:12.990]  But when I smelled this Gorilla Glue,
[02:12.990 --> 02:15.670]  something in my nose was like, dude, buy a gram of that.
[02:15.670 --> 02:18.070]  And so I got a gram of it, and I had been dabbing on it,
[02:18.070 --> 02:20.790]  and when I smoke this, I get so high.
[02:20.790 --> 02:22.230]  Like, it just does something to me.
[02:22.230 --> 02:23.830]  It makes me like have to sit down for a minute.
[02:23.830 --> 02:24.750]  I forget what I'm doing.
[02:24.750 --> 02:26.310]  I forget what I was trying to do.
[02:26.310 --> 02:28.110]  This Gorilla Glue has been fucking me up.
[02:28.110 --> 02:30.710]  So this nice change has been a great treat.
[02:30.710 --> 02:32.710]  So I'm glad I smelled that.
[02:32.710 --> 02:35.350]  I did that episode a few weeks ago called Follow Your Nose,
[02:35.350 --> 02:39.270]  and I'm glad I took my own advice and followed my nose.
[02:39.310 --> 02:40.910]  All right, before I get too far and too rambly,
[02:40.910 --> 02:43.670]  let me make one apology.
[02:43.670 --> 02:46.070]  Last week, my episode did not load to Stitcher.
[02:46.070 --> 02:49.190]  If you listen to the podcast on Stitcher, I apologize.
[02:49.190 --> 02:50.190]  I posted the episode.
[02:50.190 --> 02:51.790]  It was there Monday morning on iTunes.
[02:51.790 --> 02:53.030]  Everybody listened on iTunes.
[02:53.030 --> 02:54.590]  They all saw it on my website.
[02:54.590 --> 02:57.750]  But for some reason, Stitcher failed to grab the episode.
[02:57.750 --> 03:00.310]  I contacted Stitcher several times.
[03:00.310 --> 03:02.310]  They basically ignored my emails.
[03:02.310 --> 03:03.790]  Usually, they're able to get my show up
[03:03.790 --> 03:05.750]  within 24 hours if there's an issue.
[03:05.750 --> 03:07.710]  This time, they just basically ignored me.
[03:07.710 --> 03:11.030]  So on Friday, I relaunched the episode.
[03:11.030 --> 03:12.230]  I was able to make it go.
[03:12.230 --> 03:14.470]  I blocked it from iTunes so it's not repeated in iTunes.
[03:14.470 --> 03:17.230]  But if you're listening on like PodBay or Podcaster
[03:17.230 --> 03:18.430]  or something like that,
[03:18.430 --> 03:20.310]  that episode will be in the feed twice.
[03:20.310 --> 03:23.070]  If you're on Stitcher, I encourage you and invite you
[03:23.070 --> 03:25.830]  to go back and listen to episode number 227.
[03:25.830 --> 03:26.870]  It should've came out Monday.
[03:26.870 --> 03:27.870]  It did not make it out.
[03:27.870 --> 03:28.990]  It came out Friday.
[03:28.990 --> 03:29.910]  It's available now.
[03:29.910 --> 03:31.950]  The episode features Mike and myself,
[03:31.950 --> 03:34.230]  and I'm sure you would like to hear what you missed.
[03:34.230 --> 03:35.190]  So the episode is up.
[03:35.190 --> 03:36.190]  I apologize.
[03:36.190 --> 03:38.870]  I also apologize for it taking me until Friday
[03:38.870 --> 03:40.470]  to correct a Monday episode.
[03:40.470 --> 03:42.430]  I kept thinking maybe Stitcher would email me
[03:42.430 --> 03:43.830]  and reply and fix it,
[03:43.830 --> 03:46.430]  and I didn't wanna repost it and then have them fix it
[03:46.430 --> 03:47.550]  and the episode be there twice
[03:47.550 --> 03:49.230]  and it just be a clusterfuck.
[03:49.230 --> 03:50.430]  But instead, I just did it.
[03:50.430 --> 03:51.270]  It's done.
[03:51.270 --> 03:52.110]  It's up there.
[03:52.110 --> 03:53.670]  Thanks for being patient with me.
[03:53.670 --> 03:56.790]  Also, huge thank you to everybody who sent me a tweet,
[03:56.790 --> 03:58.070]  an email, a Facebook message,
[03:58.070 --> 03:59.030]  everyone who reached out and said,
[03:59.030 --> 04:00.870]  hey dude, where's my Monday episode?
[04:00.870 --> 04:02.710]  It lets me know that you guys are actually paying attention
[04:02.710 --> 04:03.950]  and that you miss me when I'm not there.
[04:03.950 --> 04:04.950]  So thank you.
[04:04.950 --> 04:06.030]  Thanks for keeping an eye on the show.
[04:06.870 --> 04:07.710]  I appreciate it.
[04:07.710 --> 04:08.550]  If it ever happens again,
[04:08.550 --> 04:09.910]  please do email me right away
[04:09.910 --> 04:11.470]  because I don't listen to the show on Stitcher.
[04:11.470 --> 04:12.430]  I don't listen on iTunes.
[04:12.430 --> 04:14.110]  I don't listen to my own podcast.
[04:14.110 --> 04:14.950]  I record it.
[04:14.950 --> 04:15.790]  I listen back and edit it,
[04:15.790 --> 04:16.910]  and then I put it out.
[04:16.910 --> 04:19.230]  It would be really weird of me to listen again.
[04:19.230 --> 04:20.830]  So let me know if it fails, you guys.
[04:20.830 --> 04:22.110]  I need your help.
[04:23.550 --> 04:24.390]  All right.
[04:24.390 --> 04:25.750]  You could tell that those tangerine dabs
[04:25.750 --> 04:27.110]  are making my brain spin, can't you?
[04:27.110 --> 04:28.630]  I'm going super fast today.
[04:28.630 --> 04:30.270]  Let's take a quick second, center the self,
[04:30.270 --> 04:31.950]  and then I would like to read an article
[04:31.990 --> 04:36.670]  from the Westward that talks about cannabis recalls.
[04:38.390 --> 04:39.230]  All right.
[04:39.230 --> 04:40.270]  This article is from the Westward.
[04:40.270 --> 04:42.350]  It was written Friday, July 28th.
[04:42.350 --> 04:44.350]  It was actually published Friday, July 28th.
[04:44.350 --> 04:46.830]  The article is by Thomas Mitchell.
[04:46.830 --> 04:49.310]  And the start of the article, there's just a picture.
[04:49.310 --> 04:51.270]  The headline is Denver issues first recall
[04:51.270 --> 04:53.710]  for mite-infested moldy marijuana.
[04:53.710 --> 04:55.070]  Now let's get to this picture.
[04:55.070 --> 04:57.590]  There's a picture of a plant, a cannabis plant,
[04:57.590 --> 04:58.590]  that is in full bloom.
[04:58.590 --> 05:00.470]  I would guess this is seven or eight weeks into flower.
[05:00.510 --> 05:02.510]  This plant is close to being harvested.
[05:02.510 --> 05:07.230]  And this plant is fucking covered in disgusting spider mites,
[05:07.230 --> 05:09.590]  just riddled with mites.
[05:09.590 --> 05:13.350]  The spider mites have built a teepee on top of this bud.
[05:13.350 --> 05:16.110]  There is a web that goes from the top cola of this bud
[05:16.110 --> 05:19.590]  out to every single leaf, and it forms like a circus tent.
[05:19.590 --> 05:21.390]  It looks like a circus tent of spider mites,
[05:21.390 --> 05:22.910]  but it's all just a big web.
[05:22.910 --> 05:25.390]  And inside that web, I can see hundreds,
[05:25.390 --> 05:27.070]  if not thousands of little spider mites.
[05:27.070 --> 05:28.850]  They're crawling all over the plant.
[05:28.850 --> 05:30.490]  Every leaf, every section of this plant
[05:30.490 --> 05:32.010]  is crispy and crunchy.
[05:32.010 --> 05:34.130]  Every plant behind it looks like shit.
[05:34.130 --> 05:35.970]  This is the worst case of spider mites
[05:35.970 --> 05:38.010]  I have ever seen a photo of.
[05:38.010 --> 05:40.010]  And it was in a grow in Denver,
[05:40.010 --> 05:41.610]  where we are allowed to grow legally,
[05:41.610 --> 05:43.530]  where we are given guidelines on pesticides
[05:43.530 --> 05:44.510]  we can and cannot use.
[05:44.510 --> 05:46.970]  And somehow, this shit still happened.
[05:46.970 --> 05:48.570]  So let's read the article.
[05:48.570 --> 05:49.930]  It goes like this.
[05:49.930 --> 05:52.170]  Buddy's Wellness LLC is having a tough week.
[05:52.170 --> 05:53.570]  The medical marijuana cultivator,
[05:53.570 --> 05:56.450]  which sells its products through the La Bodega dispensary,
[05:57.330 --> 06:00.810]  voluntarily recalled its concentrates on July 25th
[06:00.810 --> 06:03.610]  because of a possible pesticide contamination.
[06:03.610 --> 06:05.210]  But the problem didn't end there.
[06:05.210 --> 06:07.310]  Two days later, the city of Denver announced
[06:07.310 --> 06:09.890]  that Buddy's Wellness was the first Denver marijuana grower
[06:09.890 --> 06:13.370]  recalling marijuana for mold and mites.
[06:13.370 --> 06:14.370]  That's right, you guys.
[06:14.370 --> 06:17.290]  They do test our cannabis for pesticides.
[06:17.290 --> 06:20.210]  We are not allowed to use a lot of pesticides.
[06:20.210 --> 06:21.210]  They are banned.
[06:21.210 --> 06:23.730]  When you grow in a commercial grow,
[06:23.730 --> 06:24.950]  before you can sell anything,
[06:24.950 --> 06:27.670]  you have to take a sample bud from that grow
[06:27.670 --> 06:28.710]  and send it to a lab.
[06:28.710 --> 06:31.870]  It is then tested for mold, it's tested for yeast,
[06:31.870 --> 06:33.470]  it's tested for pesticides.
[06:33.470 --> 06:34.590]  The results are sent back.
[06:34.590 --> 06:35.870]  And then once they are sent back,
[06:35.870 --> 06:37.470]  the product is what's called released,
[06:37.470 --> 06:40.370]  and we are allowed to move it from the grow location
[06:40.370 --> 06:41.890]  to retail locations.
[06:41.890 --> 06:43.710]  Until then, it sits in a safe room
[06:43.710 --> 06:46.110]  and it cannot be touched by anybody.
[06:46.110 --> 06:48.830]  There have been several cases of crops being destroyed
[06:48.830 --> 06:51.990]  because of pesticides being found in the product.
[06:51.990 --> 06:54.470]  This is the first case of them destroying
[06:54.990 --> 06:57.030]  and recalling products for spider mites.
[06:57.030 --> 06:59.670]  I think it's ridiculous that they had spider mites that bad.
[06:59.670 --> 07:00.950]  So I wanna continue with the article
[07:00.950 --> 07:03.090]  before my iPad reloads the page again and throws me off.
[07:03.090 --> 07:04.110]  It goes like this.
[07:04.110 --> 07:06.910]  In the second recall notice issued Thursday, July 27th
[07:06.910 --> 07:09.050]  by the Denver Department of Environmental Health,
[07:09.050 --> 07:11.110]  any medical marijuana consumers who purchased
[07:11.110 --> 07:13.150]  medical marijuana bearing the optional
[07:13.150 --> 07:16.030]  premise cultivation code, so let me explain that.
[07:16.030 --> 07:17.790]  On every cannabis product you buy,
[07:17.790 --> 07:19.310]  I'm just gonna pick up something here,
[07:19.310 --> 07:20.630]  this one, this jar right here.
[07:20.630 --> 07:22.770]  I've got a jar from a dispensary in Colorado Springs.
[07:22.770 --> 07:23.870]  It's got their label on it.
[07:24.230 --> 07:25.870]  I can find their OPC number.
[07:25.870 --> 07:29.550]  This is, okay, this came from MMC number,
[07:29.550 --> 07:32.790]  Medical Marijuana Cultivation Center, number 402-
[07:32.790 --> 07:34.350]  and I'm not gonna read you the numbers for my product
[07:34.350 --> 07:35.190]  because that's not important.
[07:35.190 --> 07:37.190]  I don't wanna implement their numbers in this article.
[07:37.190 --> 07:38.430]  But I can tell where this came from.
[07:38.430 --> 07:40.310]  I can tell where this was grown.
[07:40.310 --> 07:43.030]  This was grown in MMC number 402-
[07:43.030 --> 07:45.950]  and it was extracted by another one
[07:45.950 --> 07:47.070]  that I can't find the number on here,
[07:47.070 --> 07:48.710]  but oh, it's all the same center.
[07:48.710 --> 07:50.990]  This was grown and extracted by the same people.
[07:50.990 --> 07:53.070]  So I know where that came from.
[07:53.070 --> 07:54.470]  If that product was tainted,
[07:54.470 --> 07:56.350]  they would issue a recall with the number on it,
[07:56.350 --> 07:57.470]  then I would take it back
[07:57.470 --> 07:58.670]  and they would give me a full refund.
[07:58.670 --> 08:00.470]  They'd probably exchange out for a different product
[08:00.470 --> 08:02.630]  that wasn't contaminated, to tell you the truth.
[08:02.630 --> 08:04.890]  But, so everything does have
[08:04.890 --> 08:06.790]  an optional premise cultivation code
[08:06.790 --> 08:08.350]  on every container that you buy.
[08:08.350 --> 08:10.230]  So they know where that came from.
[08:11.590 --> 08:14.110]  Let's see, anything with the optional,
[08:14.110 --> 08:16.130]  I don't know, read out the number for you guys right here.
[08:16.130 --> 08:21.130]  Anything with the OPC code of 403-00364
[08:21.290 --> 08:24.350]  from La Bodega prior to July 27th,
[08:24.350 --> 08:27.510]  you are urged to return or destroy your product.
[08:27.510 --> 08:28.410]  You guys, if it's already,
[08:28.410 --> 08:30.250]  if you bought a gram and it's already half a gram,
[08:30.250 --> 08:31.090]  take it back, fuck it,
[08:31.090 --> 08:31.910]  see if they'll give you another one,
[08:31.910 --> 08:33.570]  see if they'll return it just because of this recall.
[08:33.570 --> 08:34.810]  Take this article with you and be like,
[08:34.810 --> 08:37.490]  no, they said to bring it back, I want my money back.
[08:37.490 --> 08:39.610]  If you've already smoked it, don't worry, you'll be okay.
[08:39.610 --> 08:40.710]  Hopefully you're not gonna get sick
[08:40.710 --> 08:43.090]  from smoking a little bit of powdery mildew and spider mites.
[08:43.090 --> 08:45.210]  Chances are you've smoked a shit ton before
[08:45.210 --> 08:46.250]  and just didn't know it.
[08:46.250 --> 08:48.650]  So just act like you didn't know this time also,
[08:48.650 --> 08:49.750]  you'll be okay.
[08:49.750 --> 08:50.850]  If you do feel sick from it,
[08:51.570 --> 08:52.530]  if you think you've got some problems from it,
[08:52.530 --> 08:55.250]  go to the doctor and get yourself checked out.
[08:55.250 --> 08:57.970]  Powdery mildew, it can make you sick on its own,
[08:57.970 --> 08:59.990]  but what it will do is if you've already got
[08:59.990 --> 09:01.490]  a compromised immune system,
[09:01.490 --> 09:03.450]  powdery mildew can definitely exacerbate
[09:03.450 --> 09:05.070]  whatever problems you've already got,
[09:05.070 --> 09:06.610]  especially if they're sinus related,
[09:06.610 --> 09:09.770]  respiratory related, immune related,
[09:09.770 --> 09:11.230]  any kind of mildew added to that
[09:11.230 --> 09:14.050]  will definitely fuck you up a little extra.
[09:14.050 --> 09:16.290]  So if you've got product from there, return it
[09:16.290 --> 09:18.370]  or just throw it away, your choice.
[09:18.370 --> 09:19.930]  So I'm gonna continue with the article it goes,
[09:19.930 --> 09:21.770]  the DEH recall notice said there have been
[09:21.770 --> 09:23.570]  no reports of illness from Buddy's products,
[09:23.570 --> 09:25.630]  but noted that samples of dried marijuana
[09:25.630 --> 09:29.150]  contained potentially unsafe levels of yeast and mold,
[09:29.150 --> 09:30.970]  while live plants were found contaminated
[09:30.970 --> 09:32.730]  with mildew and mites.
[09:32.730 --> 09:34.570]  Let me talk about the yeast and mold.
[09:35.970 --> 09:38.930]  It is very easy to fail a yeast test
[09:38.930 --> 09:40.170]  for cannabis in Colorado.
[09:40.170 --> 09:42.130]  Just a little bit too much moisture
[09:42.130 --> 09:45.650]  for a little bit too long and yeast develops on everything.
[09:45.650 --> 09:49.530]  So you can lose entire crops to just a little bit of yeast
[09:49.530 --> 09:51.530]  in your post harvested product.
[09:51.530 --> 09:53.930]  A lot of times it happens after the plants are cut down,
[09:53.930 --> 09:55.810]  they're cut down, they hang dry, they're harvested,
[09:55.810 --> 09:58.590]  they're trimmed, they're put in a container
[09:58.590 --> 10:00.850]  and then somebody closes that container for too long.
[10:00.850 --> 10:03.370]  There's moisture in there, it locks up the moisture,
[10:03.370 --> 10:05.050]  the air, they put it in the dark,
[10:05.050 --> 10:06.850]  it starts making a little bit of yeast
[10:06.850 --> 10:09.530]  and then they test it and the growers think
[10:09.530 --> 10:10.930]  they're curing the product perfectly,
[10:10.930 --> 10:13.170]  but that little bit of excess moisture creates yeast
[10:13.170 --> 10:15.210]  and then they fail a microbial test.
[10:15.210 --> 10:18.450]  So that's not a hard test to fail, that one is really easy.
[10:18.450 --> 10:19.570]  Though with all the other shit going on,
[10:19.570 --> 10:20.730]  I'm just gonna assume that these guys
[10:20.730 --> 10:21.930]  are fucking that up too.
[10:23.010 --> 10:25.250]  Unsafe levels of yeast and mold.
[10:25.250 --> 10:28.130]  So mold is powdery mildew, mold could be bud rot,
[10:28.130 --> 10:29.930]  mold could be a lot of different things.
[10:29.930 --> 10:32.290]  We're gonna assume it was a powdery mildew.
[10:32.290 --> 10:35.050]  While live plants, oh no it says they differentiate
[10:35.050 --> 10:36.170]  between powdery mildew and mites,
[10:36.170 --> 10:37.450]  so they had straight bud mold,
[10:37.450 --> 10:39.770]  they had moldy bud in their products.
[10:39.770 --> 10:41.570]  While live plants were found contaminated
[10:41.570 --> 10:44.010]  with mildew and spider mites.
[10:44.010 --> 10:46.450]  They show a picture at the bottom of the page here.
[10:46.450 --> 10:48.650]  This plant has got enough powdery mildew on it
[10:48.650 --> 10:50.250]  to where it just looks like a powdered donut.
[10:50.250 --> 10:52.610]  It looks like you just threw powdered donut sugar
[10:52.610 --> 10:55.270]  all over these plants, it is disgusting.
[10:55.270 --> 10:57.350]  I don't know how somebody worked in there
[10:57.350 --> 10:59.330]  and didn't get sick.
[10:59.330 --> 11:00.770]  They had to have been wearing a respirator
[11:00.770 --> 11:01.890]  just to walk in there.
[11:01.890 --> 11:03.850]  How do they know not to do something about that?
[11:03.850 --> 11:05.150]  That is so crazy.
[11:05.150 --> 11:06.450]  All right, I'm gonna continue with the article here.
[11:06.450 --> 11:09.690]  It says, the mold recall stems from a DEH investigation
[11:09.690 --> 11:11.770]  to residual levels of mites.
[11:11.770 --> 11:13.150]  Let me try to say this right.
[11:13.150 --> 11:14.530]  I've always read this word
[11:14.530 --> 11:16.130]  and I've never tried to say it out loud, I don't think,
[11:16.810 --> 11:17.650]  unless it was on the podcast.
[11:17.650 --> 11:20.130]  Myclobutanol, that was easier than it looked.
[11:20.130 --> 11:22.570]  Investigation into residual levels of myclobutanol
[11:22.570 --> 11:24.650]  found in Buddy's Trim and concentrates
[11:24.650 --> 11:26.430]  by state approved cannabis testing labs.
[11:26.430 --> 11:29.010]  According to Department of Health investigation reports
[11:29.010 --> 11:31.130]  received through a Colorado Open Records Act
[11:31.130 --> 11:32.490]  requested from Westward.
[11:32.490 --> 11:34.370]  That's a really long sentence.
[11:34.370 --> 11:37.410]  Myclobutanol is used to fight powdery mildew and marijuana
[11:37.410 --> 11:40.330]  and is commonly found in Eagle 20, a fungicide
[11:40.330 --> 11:42.890]  applied to grapes and other agricultural products.
[11:42.890 --> 11:45.910]  It is banned as a marijuana pesticide
[11:46.690 --> 11:47.950]  by the Colorado Department of Agriculture.
[11:47.950 --> 11:50.230]  That's right, you guys, we cannot use Eagle 20
[11:50.230 --> 11:51.150]  in a commercial grow.
[11:51.150 --> 11:53.870]  You should not be using Eagle 20 in your private grow.
[11:53.870 --> 11:56.790]  I try to follow the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division
[11:56.790 --> 11:58.490]  guidelines on any grow that I am in.
[11:58.490 --> 12:00.510]  If it is a marijuana enforcement division
[12:00.510 --> 12:02.470]  regulated grow or not.
[12:02.470 --> 12:04.350]  If it's a private grow, if it's a commercial grow,
[12:04.350 --> 12:06.350]  if it's a caregiver grow, whatever it is,
[12:06.350 --> 12:07.550]  I try to follow those guidelines
[12:07.550 --> 12:09.630]  because I feel like they have done their research
[12:09.630 --> 12:11.950]  and they know what we should and should not be using.
[12:11.950 --> 12:13.870]  And why not just learn how to do everything
[12:13.870 --> 12:14.810]  based on their rules,
[12:14.810 --> 12:17.810]  because that's the way everything is heading anyway.
[12:17.810 --> 12:18.930]  If you just learn to play by the rules,
[12:18.930 --> 12:20.730]  you don't have to adjust so strongly
[12:20.730 --> 12:22.250]  when they start enforcing the rules on you.
[12:22.250 --> 12:24.010]  Just follow the rules from the beginning.
[12:24.010 --> 12:26.050]  All right, so let's keep moving in the article.
[12:26.050 --> 12:28.090]  It goes like this, Buddy's owner and operator,
[12:28.090 --> 12:30.510]  Gabriel Sandoval says that myclobutanol levels
[12:30.510 --> 12:33.250]  on his trim and concentrates resulted from a residue
[12:33.250 --> 12:36.090]  left in his pesticide applicators years ago.
[12:36.090 --> 12:38.810]  The moldy and mite infested plants cited by the DEH
[12:38.810 --> 12:40.930]  were plants put on hold for pesticide testing
[12:40.930 --> 12:43.010]  that he'd been waiting to destroy.
[12:43.010 --> 12:47.130]  So he's saying that the pesticide was a residual
[12:47.130 --> 12:48.530]  that was left in the paint sprayer
[12:48.530 --> 12:50.370]  because a lot of these guys use a paint sprayer
[12:50.370 --> 12:51.570]  as an applicator.
[12:51.570 --> 12:54.570]  I was left in the pesticide applicators years ago.
[12:54.570 --> 12:57.170]  So he didn't clean out his paint sprayer for years?
[12:57.170 --> 12:58.010]  Is that what he's trying to say?
[12:58.010 --> 12:59.450]  That it's just been in there for years
[12:59.450 --> 13:01.050]  because you're supposed to clean those out
[13:01.050 --> 13:01.890]  when you get done using them.
[13:01.890 --> 13:03.410]  No matter what kind of sprayer you're using,
[13:03.410 --> 13:05.250]  you're supposed to triple rinse that bitch
[13:05.250 --> 13:07.090]  before you put anything else in it.
[13:07.090 --> 13:08.730]  So that sounds fishy.
[13:08.730 --> 13:10.330]  Did he just let it sit for a couple of years?
[13:10.330 --> 13:11.170]  Did he not clean it?
[13:11.210 --> 13:13.130]  Does he not spray anything else through it?
[13:13.130 --> 13:14.970]  That doesn't sound right to me.
[13:14.970 --> 13:17.690]  But he also says that the plants that were moldy
[13:17.690 --> 13:19.970]  were plants that were put on hold for pesticide testing
[13:19.970 --> 13:21.090]  that he'd been waiting to destroy.
[13:21.090 --> 13:23.450]  So he wasn't even taking care of the plants
[13:23.450 --> 13:25.010]  that were going to be tested
[13:25.010 --> 13:26.890]  to see if they were contaminated with pesticides
[13:26.890 --> 13:28.530]  because he knew he had to destroy them.
[13:28.530 --> 13:29.450]  He goes on to say,
[13:29.450 --> 13:30.930]  they told us not to spray anything
[13:30.930 --> 13:32.890]  before we took the initial test.
[13:32.890 --> 13:34.050]  So we left it alone.
[13:34.050 --> 13:36.530]  They said this stuff was going to get destroyed, he says.
[13:36.530 --> 13:38.410]  I didn't want to waste money on lights and water
[13:38.410 --> 13:39.850]  to maintain them because I knew
[13:39.890 --> 13:42.010]  that they weren't going to make it.
[13:42.010 --> 13:45.890]  So he's telling him that he was told not to spray anything,
[13:45.890 --> 13:48.230]  which doesn't make sense because you're allowed to spray.
[13:48.230 --> 13:49.070]  Even if they're coming,
[13:49.070 --> 13:50.290]  they want to know what you're spraying.
[13:50.290 --> 13:51.210]  That's why you're spraying.
[13:51.210 --> 13:52.530]  That's why they're coming to check.
[13:52.530 --> 13:54.850]  They're making sure you're doing shit right.
[13:54.850 --> 13:56.290]  And he didn't want to keep feeding the plants
[13:56.290 --> 13:57.130]  and take care of the plants
[13:57.130 --> 13:59.110]  because he knew they were going to get destroyed.
[13:59.110 --> 14:00.550]  How did he know they were going to get destroyed?
[14:00.550 --> 14:02.610]  Did he know they were not going to pass tests?
[14:02.610 --> 14:03.890]  Because if they would have passed tests,
[14:03.890 --> 14:04.970]  they would not have,
[14:04.970 --> 14:06.550]  there would have been no need to destroy them.
[14:06.550 --> 14:09.390]  They were only going to be destroyed if they failed the test.
[14:09.910 --> 14:11.870]  So he knew they were not going to pass these tests.
[14:11.870 --> 14:13.030]  He quit feeding them.
[14:13.030 --> 14:14.350]  He just quit taking care of them.
[14:14.350 --> 14:16.350]  So let's continue with the article.
[14:16.350 --> 14:18.790]  Sandoval should have maintained the plants well enough
[14:18.790 --> 14:20.250]  to keep fungus and pests at bay,
[14:20.250 --> 14:23.110]  according to a DEH investigation report filed
[14:23.110 --> 14:26.330]  right before the July 27th recall was ordered.
[14:26.330 --> 14:29.510]  Based upon visual evidence of insects and mold
[14:29.510 --> 14:31.470]  on live flowering plants in the facility,
[14:31.470 --> 14:34.010]  statements from staff regarding pervasiveness of insects
[14:34.010 --> 14:36.550]  and mold within the facility and laboratory reports
[14:36.550 --> 14:38.410]  listing high levels of yeast and mold
[14:38.410 --> 14:39.730]  in dried plant material,
[14:39.730 --> 14:41.610]  the Denver Department of Environmental Health
[14:41.610 --> 14:43.570]  finds sufficient evidence that plant material
[14:43.570 --> 14:46.290]  is potentially unsafe for human consumption.
[14:46.290 --> 14:47.810]  The report reads,
[14:47.810 --> 14:50.450]  God, I'm glad I've never had cannabis with that label on it.
[14:50.450 --> 14:52.130]  Unsafe for human consumption.
[14:52.130 --> 14:54.290]  That's a fucked up stamp to put on your product.
[14:54.290 --> 14:55.130]  It keeps going.
[14:55.130 --> 14:56.330]  It says, despite Sandoval's claims
[14:56.330 --> 14:57.730]  that he was ordered to not spray
[14:57.730 --> 14:59.850]  or clean the plants for 72 hours,
[14:59.850 --> 15:04.290]  DEH food, DEH food safety and marijuana program supervisor,
[15:04.290 --> 15:07.090]  Carolyn Laveau says that any marijuana plant put on hold
[15:07.090 --> 15:09.530]  by the DEH can be fully maintained,
[15:09.530 --> 15:11.330]  and that includes allowing the application
[15:11.330 --> 15:13.650]  of Colorado Department of Agriculture approved
[15:13.650 --> 15:15.750]  fungicide and pesticides.
[15:15.750 --> 15:18.610]  Yes, that is, I'm pretty sure that that's a clear thing.
[15:18.610 --> 15:21.510]  Anybody that works in an MED regulated facility
[15:21.510 --> 15:22.350]  should know that.
[15:22.350 --> 15:24.130]  Anybody with any worker protection safety training
[15:24.130 --> 15:24.970]  should know that.
[15:24.970 --> 15:27.890]  Anybody with any Department of Ag training should know that.
[15:27.890 --> 15:30.830]  And if you work in these facilities as a master grower,
[15:30.830 --> 15:33.090]  that is your responsibility to know that shit.
[15:33.090 --> 15:33.930]  And if you don't know that shit,
[15:33.930 --> 15:35.490]  you gotta call the lawyer, you gotta call the owner,
[15:35.490 --> 15:36.810]  you gotta call the compliance officer,
[15:37.530 --> 15:38.450]  you gotta call somebody and figure it out.
[15:38.450 --> 15:39.350]  Quit fucking it up.
[15:39.350 --> 15:40.810]  So if you're in charge of a grow,
[15:40.810 --> 15:42.870]  find out what you are and are not allowed to do,
[15:42.870 --> 15:45.130]  because this is serious right now, you guys.
[15:45.130 --> 15:46.690]  I'm gonna continue with the article,
[15:46.690 --> 15:48.650]  but first let's talk about this picture.
[15:48.650 --> 15:50.650]  Buddy's Wellness destroyed every plant
[15:50.650 --> 15:53.930]  in its Cedar Avenue grow on July 27th.
[15:53.930 --> 15:55.870]  There's a picture of a warehouse
[15:55.870 --> 15:57.250]  with some five gallon buckets
[15:57.250 --> 15:59.690]  with some shitty looking dirt in there.
[15:59.690 --> 16:02.050]  It looks like cocoa with not enough perlite,
[16:02.050 --> 16:03.330]  and they've got tomato cages on it,
[16:03.330 --> 16:06.490]  but all the plants are just chopped down on the floor.
[16:07.170 --> 16:09.810]  They have got five gallon buckets of cocoa
[16:09.810 --> 16:11.130]  on a concrete floor.
[16:12.370 --> 16:13.650]  That's not a professional setup.
[16:13.650 --> 16:15.210]  Get the plants up off the fucking floor, you guys.
[16:15.210 --> 16:16.050]  Come on.
[16:16.050 --> 16:18.290]  So anyway, it says the July 27th recall
[16:18.290 --> 16:20.630]  came on the same day that Buddy's
[16:20.630 --> 16:23.010]  voluntarily destroyed every plant in its grow,
[16:23.010 --> 16:27.750]  throwing away 72 flowering plants, 119 vegging plants,
[16:27.750 --> 16:29.970]  and nearly 20 pounds of dried flour,
[16:29.970 --> 16:33.130]  according to a Department of Health Investigation report.
[16:33.130 --> 16:34.570]  I feel like they're trying to shut us down,
[16:34.570 --> 16:37.010]  Sandville says, we're a small family run business,
[16:37.010 --> 16:38.810]  so this is a nightmare.
[16:38.810 --> 16:41.330]  You guys, this may sound like some bullshit to you,
[16:41.330 --> 16:44.030]  but as a small family run business,
[16:44.030 --> 16:44.970]  this should never happen.
[16:44.970 --> 16:47.170]  If it's a small family run business,
[16:47.170 --> 16:48.570]  that was very few plants.
[16:48.570 --> 16:50.490]  I've got more plants than that in one room
[16:50.490 --> 16:51.970]  at the grow I run at Three Rivers.
[16:51.970 --> 16:55.290]  I've got more plants than that in one small space.
[16:55.290 --> 16:56.330]  I can take care of that.
[16:56.330 --> 16:58.890]  I could have taken care of this grow by myself
[16:58.890 --> 17:00.730]  and not have gotten this many problems.
[17:00.730 --> 17:03.390]  With two pesticide applications per week,
[17:03.390 --> 17:05.290]  and then a release of predator mites
[17:05.290 --> 17:07.070]  just a couple of weeks into flower,
[17:07.070 --> 17:08.350]  they never would have had this problem,
[17:08.350 --> 17:09.550]  but they were not paying attention,
[17:09.550 --> 17:10.470]  they were trying to be cheap,
[17:10.470 --> 17:12.090]  they were trying to cut corners.
[17:12.090 --> 17:14.150]  I can assume, I don't know what happened,
[17:14.150 --> 17:15.230]  but they were failing.
[17:15.230 --> 17:16.950]  This is a very small grow.
[17:16.950 --> 17:19.150]  This guy's trying to say we're a small mom and pop business.
[17:19.150 --> 17:21.750]  If you're that small, this should not have been a problem.
[17:21.750 --> 17:22.710]  You should have been able to get in there
[17:22.710 --> 17:25.350]  and fucking take care of these pests by yourself.
[17:25.350 --> 17:27.490]  I can tell that these plants are not defoliated.
[17:27.490 --> 17:29.150]  There are mites all over every leaf.
[17:29.150 --> 17:30.310]  If you would have pulled off some of the leaves,
[17:30.310 --> 17:32.110]  you would have taken off a lot of the opportunity
[17:32.110 --> 17:33.190]  for powdery mildew to grow.
[17:34.030 --> 17:34.870]  If you would have taken off a lot of opportunity
[17:34.870 --> 17:36.630]  for spider mites to hang out.
[17:36.630 --> 17:39.350]  These guys don't seem to have done anything
[17:39.350 --> 17:40.870]  to prevent bugs or powdery mildew.
[17:40.870 --> 17:42.470]  They don't seem to know what they needed to do
[17:42.470 --> 17:43.790]  by the looks of the pictures.
[17:43.790 --> 17:44.870]  I'm gonna continue with the article.
[17:44.870 --> 17:47.390]  The DEH pictures below show a cultivation riddled
[17:47.390 --> 17:49.510]  with powdery mildew and spider mites.
[17:49.510 --> 17:52.590]  Sandoval says he's decided to destroy those plants
[17:52.590 --> 17:54.370]  weeks before the photos were taken,
[17:54.370 --> 17:57.030]  but wasn't allowed to do so until Department of Health
[17:57.030 --> 17:59.590]  and Marijuana Enforcement Division agents were present
[17:59.590 --> 18:01.310]  per state regulations.
[18:01.310 --> 18:02.670]  He says the plants pictured below
[18:03.190 --> 18:05.030]  were destroyed the same days the photos were taken
[18:05.030 --> 18:07.110]  on July 5th and July 21st,
[18:07.110 --> 18:09.970]  and DEH investigator Richard Pruckler confirms
[18:09.970 --> 18:11.390]  that Sandoval destroyed the plants
[18:11.390 --> 18:13.590]  after the pictures were snapped.
[18:13.590 --> 18:15.230]  So in a case like this, you guys,
[18:15.230 --> 18:18.030]  normally on a normal day, if I've got a plant in the grow
[18:18.030 --> 18:20.070]  and I decide, hey, I don't need this plant,
[18:20.070 --> 18:21.130]  I can destroy it.
[18:21.130 --> 18:22.470]  I cut it down.
[18:22.470 --> 18:23.710]  It goes through a wood chipper.
[18:23.710 --> 18:25.270]  It's considered green waste.
[18:25.270 --> 18:27.670]  It has to be destroyed to where it's unrecognizable.
[18:27.670 --> 18:28.630]  It goes through a wood chipper.
[18:28.630 --> 18:30.510]  It gets mixed into a bag with kitty litter
[18:30.510 --> 18:31.790]  and leftover soil.
[18:31.790 --> 18:32.910]  So now it is mulch.
[18:32.910 --> 18:33.730]  You can't get to it.
[18:33.730 --> 18:35.450]  Then it is put into a trash can that is locked
[18:35.450 --> 18:37.670]  and it's removed by a trash service.
[18:37.670 --> 18:40.590]  The only thing I have to do is go to my computer
[18:40.590 --> 18:42.990]  and mark that plant number that it's killed
[18:42.990 --> 18:44.350]  and that plant no longer exists.
[18:44.350 --> 18:46.510]  I have to cut the plant tag in half and throw that away.
[18:46.510 --> 18:47.350]  Now that plant is dead.
[18:47.350 --> 18:49.310]  It does not exist in my system.
[18:49.310 --> 18:50.670]  And in a case like this,
[18:50.670 --> 18:52.150]  when they've got contaminated plants,
[18:52.150 --> 18:54.790]  they have to be destroyed under supervision.
[18:54.790 --> 18:57.110]  People from the MED and the Department of Ag
[18:57.110 --> 18:58.230]  and the Department of Health come
[18:58.230 --> 18:59.790]  and watch you destroy these plants
[18:59.790 --> 19:02.190]  to make sure they are not snuck out the back door,
[19:02.190 --> 19:04.030]  to make sure that you don't do anything fishy with them.
[19:04.030 --> 19:06.790]  I hope they watch them destroy the 20 pounds of herb
[19:06.790 --> 19:08.590]  that they said they had to get rid of also,
[19:08.590 --> 19:09.830]  because I don't want that shit
[19:09.830 --> 19:11.350]  to make it to the black market.
[19:11.350 --> 19:14.010]  You guys, that's why black market cannabis is dangerous,
[19:14.010 --> 19:15.650]  because there's all kinds of shit sprayed in it.
[19:15.650 --> 19:16.870]  There's no regulation.
[19:16.870 --> 19:17.890]  There are no rules.
[19:17.890 --> 19:18.730]  There could be yeast.
[19:18.730 --> 19:19.550]  There could be mold.
[19:19.550 --> 19:20.390]  There could be mites.
[19:20.390 --> 19:22.110]  They could be having fungus in there.
[19:22.110 --> 19:22.950]  And they don't give a shit
[19:22.950 --> 19:24.430]  because they need to make their money
[19:24.430 --> 19:25.670]  and nobody's ever gonna come look.
[19:25.670 --> 19:28.990]  So I would recommend that you go through a dispensary
[19:28.990 --> 19:29.990]  if you were in Colorado
[19:29.990 --> 19:32.150]  and get your cannabis through a dispensary.
[19:32.150 --> 19:33.110]  It's been tested.
[19:33.110 --> 19:33.950]  It is safe.
[19:33.950 --> 19:36.150]  If it's not tested, it gets destroyed.
[19:36.150 --> 19:37.630]  So I'm gonna keep going.
[19:37.630 --> 19:40.030]  "'We don't enjoy doing this,' DEH investigator
[19:40.030 --> 19:42.150]  Kelsey Hanley says, commenting on the city
[19:42.150 --> 19:44.230]  destroying plants and issuing recalls.
[19:44.230 --> 19:46.750]  We try our best to work with them, but mistakes happen.
[19:46.750 --> 19:49.070]  Gabriel's doing his best to correct them.
[19:49.070 --> 19:51.590]  The DEH has issued nearly a hundred public recalls
[19:51.590 --> 19:52.570]  for marijuana products,
[19:52.570 --> 19:54.110]  but virtually all of them were recalled
[19:54.110 --> 19:55.590]  because of pesticides.
[19:55.590 --> 19:56.570]  Laveau says,
[19:56.650 --> 20:00.050]  Buddy's Recall is the first ever issued for mold or mites.
[20:00.050 --> 20:02.250]  Buddy's now has until Sunday, July 31st
[20:02.250 --> 20:04.450]  to contact business and medical patients
[20:04.450 --> 20:06.010]  with available contact information
[20:06.010 --> 20:08.650]  who purchased La Bodega products in the last three months
[20:08.650 --> 20:11.090]  to advise them of the recall."
[20:11.090 --> 20:12.450]  And then there are some photos and it says,
[20:12.450 --> 20:13.810]  "'Here are the pictures.
[20:13.810 --> 20:17.570]  Here are DEH photos of the now destroyed plants.
[20:17.570 --> 20:21.010]  This plant, I cannot see through the webbing
[20:21.010 --> 20:22.970]  to find where the plant is.
[20:22.970 --> 20:25.050]  This one just looks like they put a plastic bag
[20:25.050 --> 20:26.170]  right over the plant
[20:26.170 --> 20:28.810]  and then just filled the plastic bag with spider mites.
[20:28.810 --> 20:33.250]  This next picture is got so much spider mite webbing on it,
[20:33.250 --> 20:34.930]  it looks like cotton.
[20:34.930 --> 20:37.530]  This one shows, that was a nice plant
[20:37.530 --> 20:39.190]  until it got fucking riddled with mites.
[20:39.190 --> 20:41.930]  These guys know how to grow decently.
[20:41.930 --> 20:43.650]  They just don't know how to take care of pests.
[20:43.650 --> 20:45.870]  Oh, look at this powdery mildew, you guys.
[20:45.870 --> 20:48.010]  This plant is very sparse.
[20:48.010 --> 20:50.130]  It's not very, very branchy.
[20:50.130 --> 20:51.470]  It's not very beefy,
[20:51.470 --> 20:54.930]  but the powdery mildew looks just like a powdered donut.
[20:55.770 --> 20:56.770]  It just looks like you dunked this fucker in sugar.
[20:56.770 --> 20:58.410]  It is so gross.
[20:58.410 --> 21:00.250]  All right, that's all the pictures in this article.
[21:00.250 --> 21:01.970]  You guys, if you bought anything at Buddy's,
[21:01.970 --> 21:05.010]  I highly recommend that you go back and exchange that
[21:05.010 --> 21:06.850]  or just return it, get your money back.
[21:06.850 --> 21:08.730]  Or if you just bought one gram and it's far away,
[21:08.730 --> 21:09.970]  just fucking throw it away.
[21:09.970 --> 21:11.870]  Don't smoke it, don't make yourself sick.
[21:11.870 --> 21:13.050]  It'll probably gross yourself out
[21:13.050 --> 21:15.330]  when you hear those spider mite eggs popping in there anyway.
[21:15.330 --> 21:16.530]  You won't want to dab it.
[21:17.450 --> 21:19.130]  Hopefully, we don't see a lot more
[21:19.130 --> 21:20.550]  of this crap in our industry.
[21:20.550 --> 21:22.850]  You guys, if anybody out there runs a commercial grow,
[21:22.850 --> 21:25.170]  a marijuana enforcement division regulated grow,
[21:25.170 --> 21:27.050]  and you're having problems with powdery mildew,
[21:27.050 --> 21:31.250]  spider mites, fungus gnats, almost anything,
[21:31.250 --> 21:32.570]  myself and a couple of friends,
[21:32.570 --> 21:34.070]  we know how to get rid of the shit.
[21:34.070 --> 21:36.010]  Contact me, we will help you.
[21:36.010 --> 21:37.730]  I can give you a little bit of advice.
[21:37.730 --> 21:39.050]  I won't charge anything.
[21:39.050 --> 21:41.010]  If we need to do a full-on consultation,
[21:41.010 --> 21:42.290]  we'll set up an appointment.
[21:42.290 --> 21:43.450]  Somebody will come to your grow.
[21:43.450 --> 21:44.970]  We'll tell you what needs to be done.
[21:44.970 --> 21:46.890]  It may take a little bit to schedule somebody,
[21:46.890 --> 21:48.250]  but we're here to help.
[21:48.250 --> 21:49.350]  Let me know.
[21:49.350 --> 21:51.090]  Most of this can be handled through some emails.
[21:51.090 --> 21:52.090]  I know what to do.
[21:52.130 --> 21:53.170]  We know what to do.
[21:53.170 --> 21:54.850]  We've been doing this.
[21:54.850 --> 21:56.370]  If you need help, see, I'd rather just help you
[21:56.370 --> 21:57.930]  get rid of this shit so we can quit
[21:57.930 --> 21:59.810]  destroying and recalling cannabis.
[21:59.810 --> 22:01.530]  So if you need help with it, let me know.
[22:01.530 --> 22:03.810]  Also, if you're in a home grow, whatever,
[22:03.810 --> 22:05.930]  you got problems, let me know, we can help you out.
[22:05.930 --> 22:07.810]  I've done a lot of episodes on pest prevention
[22:07.810 --> 22:09.970]  and pest management and powdery mildew management,
[22:09.970 --> 22:11.710]  but it gets different when you're on a large scale.
[22:11.710 --> 22:14.330]  So if you've got a giant grow and you're getting problems,
[22:14.330 --> 22:16.650]  let me know, we will talk about it.
[22:16.650 --> 22:17.490]  Now, you know what?
[22:17.490 --> 22:18.770]  Let's not even waste time.
[22:18.770 --> 22:20.690]  Things that are approved by the Colorado Marijuana
[22:20.690 --> 22:22.570]  Enforcement Division and the Colorado Department
[22:22.570 --> 22:24.490]  of Agriculture that you can apply to your plants
[22:24.490 --> 22:26.050]  to keep away powdery mildew.
[22:27.050 --> 22:30.810]  Early in the phase, or early in veg, or before flower,
[22:30.810 --> 22:33.090]  you can use a product called,
[22:33.090 --> 22:34.570]  trying to remember the name, Banish.
[22:34.570 --> 22:36.290]  Banish is oils.
[22:36.290 --> 22:39.690]  Banish also has a buddy product called Smite.
[22:39.690 --> 22:42.650]  Smite's for spider mites, Banish is for mildew.
[22:42.650 --> 22:43.690]  They both work.
[22:43.690 --> 22:45.170]  They are both oils.
[22:45.170 --> 22:46.970]  Do not apply them with the lights on.
[22:46.970 --> 22:48.410]  They will burn the fuck out of your plants
[22:48.410 --> 22:49.810]  if you spray them and have lights on.
[22:49.810 --> 22:50.930]  Make sure you turn the lights off
[22:50.930 --> 22:52.430]  if you use Smite or Banish.
[22:53.410 --> 22:58.090]  In flower, for powdery mildew, I recommend Xerotal.
[22:58.090 --> 22:59.970]  Xerotal smells like hell.
[22:59.970 --> 23:01.170]  It's mostly peroxide.
[23:01.170 --> 23:02.730]  It doesn't leave a smell on your plants.
[23:02.730 --> 23:04.910]  It doesn't leave any residue on the plants,
[23:04.910 --> 23:08.050]  but it does destroy powdery mildew on contact.
[23:08.050 --> 23:09.490]  It will dissolve the powdery mildew.
[23:09.490 --> 23:10.870]  It will stop the growth.
[23:10.870 --> 23:12.650]  With a couple applications, you will destroy it
[23:12.650 --> 23:14.150]  and then you'll rinse it right off.
[23:14.150 --> 23:15.250]  It will be gone.
[23:15.250 --> 23:19.330]  You can mix Xerotal with a product called, Cease.
[23:19.850 --> 23:22.330]  Cease is a beneficial bacteria and a carrier agent
[23:22.330 --> 23:24.530]  and it smells like shit.
[23:24.530 --> 23:28.090]  But when you mix the Xerotal and you mix the Cease together,
[23:28.090 --> 23:30.530]  the Cease is one of the only bacterias
[23:30.530 --> 23:32.090]  that the Xerotal will not kill.
[23:32.090 --> 23:33.890]  So they will not destroy the other product.
[23:33.890 --> 23:35.290]  You can mix the Xerotal.
[23:35.290 --> 23:38.010]  I would do Xerotal, how much Xerotal do you wanna use?
[23:38.010 --> 23:41.770]  I would say 35 milliliters of Xerotal per gallon of water.
[23:41.770 --> 23:45.650]  So get your gallon of water, add 35 mils of Xerotal.
[23:45.650 --> 23:48.750]  Then add 45 milliliters of Cease.
[23:49.190 --> 23:50.350]  Stir the shit out of it.
[23:50.350 --> 23:52.430]  Put in a nice squirt of like Cocoa Wet
[23:52.430 --> 23:54.070]  or some sort of wetting agent.
[23:54.070 --> 23:56.190]  Then just douse the plants with that.
[23:56.190 --> 23:57.810]  Leave the lights off while you douse it.
[23:57.810 --> 23:58.750]  Let the plants dry.
[23:58.750 --> 23:59.830]  Turn the lights back on.
[23:59.830 --> 24:02.390]  After one or two applications, three days apart,
[24:02.390 --> 24:04.990]  you should at least knock down the powdery mildew.
[24:04.990 --> 24:07.430]  One more application about three or four days later,
[24:07.430 --> 24:09.630]  you won't have powdery mildew anymore, you guys.
[24:09.630 --> 24:11.910]  Xerotal and Cease, okay?
[24:11.910 --> 24:13.090]  Don't tell anybody I said that
[24:13.090 --> 24:15.390]  because those are trade secrets in the industry.
[24:15.390 --> 24:17.390]  I just don't want you guys having powdery mildew.
[24:17.390 --> 24:19.790]  That's how important it is to me, all right?
[24:19.790 --> 24:22.070]  Also try to figure out why you're getting powdery mildew.
[24:22.070 --> 24:24.030]  Is there too much moisture in the room?
[24:24.030 --> 24:25.250]  Is there not enough airflow?
[24:25.250 --> 24:27.310]  Do you have too many plants crammed together?
[24:27.310 --> 24:29.030]  Maybe you need to do more defoliation.
[24:29.030 --> 24:30.790]  I defoliate heavily.
[24:30.790 --> 24:32.190]  When it comes time to harvest,
[24:32.190 --> 24:33.750]  you don't have to take off any fan leaves
[24:33.750 --> 24:35.350]  because I've already defoliated them
[24:35.350 --> 24:36.950]  throughout the flowering cycle.
[24:36.950 --> 24:38.430]  About a week before harvest,
[24:38.430 --> 24:40.130]  I'll go through and pull off every other leaf
[24:40.130 --> 24:41.110]  that's been left.
[24:41.110 --> 24:42.870]  And then by harvest time, they're naked.
[24:42.870 --> 24:44.430]  So just don't be afraid to defoliate.
[24:44.430 --> 24:46.950]  Don't be afraid to apply the proper fungicides
[24:47.470 --> 24:48.310]  at the right time.
[24:48.310 --> 24:50.190]  You should be able to get rid of your powdery mildew.
[24:50.190 --> 24:52.590]  You guys, you can apply the Xerotal and the Cease Mix
[24:52.590 --> 24:56.670]  very late in flower up to like the last week of bloom.
[24:56.670 --> 24:59.990]  You should be just fine because the Xerotal evaporates.
[24:59.990 --> 25:01.150]  It kills what it needs to kill
[25:01.150 --> 25:03.470]  and then it evaporates or dissipates.
[25:03.470 --> 25:05.270]  The Cease, I would cut that out
[25:05.270 --> 25:07.070]  maybe one or two weeks before flower,
[25:07.070 --> 25:08.430]  but it will not leave a flavor.
[25:08.430 --> 25:09.910]  It won't leave any problems.
[25:09.910 --> 25:11.470]  Just apply it carefully.
[25:11.470 --> 25:13.350]  Give it time to dry before you turn on the lights
[25:13.350 --> 25:16.770]  and have plenty of airflow in the room until harvest time.
[25:17.670 --> 25:19.830]  That was a whole lot of talk from one article.
[25:19.830 --> 25:21.630]  I do have more stuff planned for the podcast.
[25:21.630 --> 25:24.110]  I did not wanna just do the whole episode on this article.
[25:24.110 --> 25:25.650]  So let me press pause for a second.
[25:25.650 --> 25:28.510]  I'm gonna take a dab of this Screamin' Tangerine.
[25:28.510 --> 25:29.670]  I'm gonna drink a little bit of water
[25:29.670 --> 25:30.950]  and get my voice corrected.
[25:30.950 --> 25:33.430]  And then I'll be right back with more podcasting.
[25:42.880 --> 25:44.560]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[25:44.560 --> 25:46.280]  I fulfilled all of my promises.
[25:46.280 --> 25:48.120]  I drank water, I took dabs,
[25:48.120 --> 25:49.880]  and I am back for more podcasting.
[25:49.880 --> 25:51.400]  I wanna give a shout out to some friends.
[25:51.400 --> 25:52.860]  I'm not sure how much I should say,
[25:52.860 --> 25:54.980]  but a friend of mine was here a little bit ago
[25:54.980 --> 25:56.380]  and they visited and they left me
[25:56.380 --> 25:59.420]  some strain-specific CBD Terp sugar.
[25:59.420 --> 26:03.380]  I've got some Granddaddy Perp CBD Terp sugar.
[26:03.380 --> 26:05.140]  I'm not a huge fan of the CBD.
[26:05.140 --> 26:07.020]  CBD does not do a lot for me.
[26:07.020 --> 26:08.820]  I think that there are patients out there
[26:08.820 --> 26:10.220]  that should be smoking the CBD,
[26:10.220 --> 26:12.820]  so I give it to them and I do not waste it.
[26:12.820 --> 26:15.900]  But this stuff tastes fucking amazing.
[26:15.900 --> 26:20.540]  This Granddaddy Perp CBD Terp sugar, I recommend that.
[26:20.540 --> 26:22.620]  If you're looking for something with delicious flavor
[26:23.380 --> 26:25.660]  and a nice, mellow, calming high, this shit is amazing.
[26:25.660 --> 26:27.140]  Shout out to my friend that gave this to me.
[26:27.140 --> 26:29.220]  I'm not sure if I should say your name
[26:29.220 --> 26:31.580]  or where it came from and you understand why.
[26:31.580 --> 26:34.300]  But huge thanks, I'm fucking loving it.
[26:34.300 --> 26:35.860]  All right, I promised more podcasting,
[26:35.860 --> 26:37.940]  so let's get to some emails.
[26:37.940 --> 26:40.500]  I love answering emails from listeners.
[26:40.500 --> 26:42.820]  So if you've got a question that you would like me to answer,
[26:42.820 --> 26:43.660]  send me an email.
[26:43.660 --> 26:45.900]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com,
[26:45.900 --> 26:49.600]  and maybe I will read your email on a future episode.
[26:49.600 --> 26:51.600]  I keep saying I've got a stack of emails to get through.
[26:51.600 --> 26:53.280]  I really do, I've been printing them out
[26:53.280 --> 26:54.160]  and I'm trying to get through them.
[26:54.160 --> 26:57.840]  So let's cut the chit chat and get right to an email.
[26:57.840 --> 27:00.600]  This one is from a person who doesn't say
[27:00.600 --> 27:01.800]  if I should use their name or not.
[27:01.800 --> 27:03.840]  I don't know if I want to get them in trouble.
[27:03.840 --> 27:05.800]  So we're just gonna call you AL.
[27:05.800 --> 27:06.960]  The message goes like this.
[27:06.960 --> 27:09.120]  I've started using VegBloom, Shine, Push,
[27:09.120 --> 27:11.400]  and Plus Life on your recommendation.
[27:11.400 --> 27:13.380]  I'm still using Mills as my base.
[27:13.380 --> 27:14.600]  I'm a little nervous to switch
[27:14.600 --> 27:16.800]  because I get pretty decent numbers.
[27:16.800 --> 27:19.800]  VegBloom would be about $500 cheaper a cycle
[27:19.800 --> 27:21.140]  if I made the switch.
[27:21.580 --> 27:23.060]  Do you follow the recommendation
[27:23.060 --> 27:25.620]  to just use Shine at one gram a gallon
[27:25.620 --> 27:27.380]  from week seven until flush?
[27:27.380 --> 27:30.100]  I'm trying to wrap my head around using only Shine.
[27:30.100 --> 27:33.980]  My water is RO, so my plants will only be getting 200 ppm
[27:33.980 --> 27:37.020]  after I add the Shine.
[27:37.020 --> 27:39.780]  There are a lot of things in here I want to address.
[27:39.780 --> 27:44.140]  I do recommend VegBloom with the Shine, Push, and Plus Life.
[27:44.140 --> 27:45.980]  It is a very simple program,
[27:45.980 --> 27:49.180]  although I would definitely recommend adding things to it.
[27:49.180 --> 27:50.360]  If you're an experienced grower
[27:50.400 --> 27:51.760]  and you want to push your garden,
[27:51.760 --> 27:53.880]  there are things you can add to it
[27:53.880 --> 27:55.660]  and it will not mess you up.
[27:55.660 --> 27:57.080]  I like to add carbohydrates.
[27:57.080 --> 27:59.520]  Sometimes I find that I need a little bit of cow mag,
[27:59.520 --> 28:02.480]  but if you're using Mills as your base,
[28:02.480 --> 28:04.380]  I think your plants are going to be really happy
[28:04.380 --> 28:07.560]  with additions of Shine, Push, and Plus Life.
[28:07.560 --> 28:09.200]  I wouldn't switch, honestly.
[28:09.200 --> 28:10.900]  If you're happy with what you're getting,
[28:10.900 --> 28:13.640]  if you're getting pretty decent numbers, stay there,
[28:13.640 --> 28:15.080]  even if it is a little bit cheaper.
[28:15.080 --> 28:17.480]  $500 right now, that's not a lot of money
[28:17.480 --> 28:18.540]  if you're running a big crop,
[28:18.540 --> 28:20.500]  especially if you're spending $500 on nutrients,
[28:20.500 --> 28:22.900]  I'd imagine you're pulling a pretty nice harvest.
[28:22.900 --> 28:24.720]  I would stick with the Mills.
[28:24.720 --> 28:26.500]  I would basically just like you did,
[28:26.500 --> 28:30.200]  add the Shine, the Push, and the Plus Life
[28:30.200 --> 28:32.580]  to the Mills recipe just like it is.
[28:32.580 --> 28:36.680]  Don't use the VegBloom base, just use the additives.
[28:36.680 --> 28:39.700]  Don't use RO, don't use Dirty, don't use HD,
[28:39.700 --> 28:40.820]  don't use any of the base.
[28:40.820 --> 28:41.780]  Use your Mills base.
[28:41.780 --> 28:44.740]  That is going to work beautifully, in my opinion.
[28:44.740 --> 28:48.300]  I think the Shine will increase your resin production.
[28:49.060 --> 28:50.220]  It might add a little bit more weight to it.
[28:50.220 --> 28:52.980]  The Push is definitely going to add vigor to your plants.
[28:52.980 --> 28:56.140]  The Push makes the plants go much faster.
[28:56.140 --> 28:58.640]  And Plus Life is going to, you're just gonna see
[28:58.640 --> 29:00.900]  more vigor, happier plants with the Plus Life.
[29:00.900 --> 29:02.260]  So keep using that stuff.
[29:02.260 --> 29:03.540]  Use the Mills.
[29:03.540 --> 29:04.360]  That's what I would do.
[29:04.360 --> 29:05.900]  Then you go on to say, anyway,
[29:05.900 --> 29:08.340]  do you follow the recommendation to use just Shine
[29:08.340 --> 29:11.660]  at one gram a gallon from week seven until flush?
[29:11.660 --> 29:12.880]  I do not do that.
[29:12.880 --> 29:15.380]  I always add stuff when I'm using VegBloom.
[29:15.380 --> 29:17.820]  And honestly, when I'm switching to the flush phase
[29:17.820 --> 29:21.980]  that late, I increase my Shine to two grams per gallon
[29:21.980 --> 29:24.460]  and start reducing my base nutrients.
[29:24.460 --> 29:26.280]  So reduce everything a little bit
[29:26.280 --> 29:27.980]  and then use two grams of Shine.
[29:27.980 --> 29:29.500]  And then when it comes time to flush,
[29:29.500 --> 29:32.020]  I'm in cocoa in my commercial grow.
[29:32.020 --> 29:33.680]  So it's really easy to flush things out.
[29:33.680 --> 29:35.700]  And I don't feel like Shine builds up a lot.
[29:35.700 --> 29:38.460]  So I'll use two grams of Shine plus a few other things
[29:38.460 --> 29:40.420]  until about the last 10 days.
[29:40.420 --> 29:41.920]  I'll use Shine for the last feed.
[29:41.920 --> 29:44.740]  And then it gets just a week of just straight water,
[29:44.740 --> 29:47.260]  pH, and then it gets flushed out real heavily.
[29:47.260 --> 29:49.860]  I make sure there's plenty of runoff on the cocoa.
[29:49.860 --> 29:54.060]  We try to get like 20, maybe 25% runoff during flush time
[29:54.060 --> 29:56.660]  to make sure that that cocoa is really cleaning itself out.
[29:56.660 --> 29:58.980]  And if you look at my photos on Instagram,
[29:58.980 --> 30:03.260]  I'm irie underscore genetics, I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[30:03.260 --> 30:05.200]  You can see when the plants start showing me
[30:05.200 --> 30:06.420]  that they've been properly flushed.
[30:06.420 --> 30:08.340]  That's how I know my flush is on point.
[30:08.340 --> 30:12.480]  We're also measuring the TDS, the EC, and the PPMs
[30:12.480 --> 30:15.060]  and the pH that come out of the bottom of the water.
[30:15.060 --> 30:16.160]  So we know what we're getting.
[30:16.160 --> 30:18.200]  We know what we put in, we know what came out.
[30:18.200 --> 30:21.840]  So I think the two grams of Shine at the end,
[30:21.840 --> 30:24.700]  right until flush time, I go, I don't do it through flush.
[30:24.700 --> 30:26.640]  I give myself a flush.
[30:26.640 --> 30:28.280]  But I think the Shine at two grams
[30:28.280 --> 30:29.640]  really does something to the plants.
[30:29.640 --> 30:31.720]  It makes them sparkly, it makes them beefy.
[30:31.720 --> 30:36.300]  I would continue to add a base nutrient up until flush time.
[30:36.300 --> 30:37.780]  Like of course, get your flush time.
[30:37.780 --> 30:40.360]  Get that seven to 14 day flush time.
[30:40.360 --> 30:42.280]  If you're in a hydro base, if you're in cocoa,
[30:43.040 --> 30:43.880]  seven to 10 days is cool.
[30:43.880 --> 30:45.920]  If you're in a soilless mix, 14 days.
[30:45.920 --> 30:47.920]  You can even go 21 days if you'd like to.
[30:47.920 --> 30:50.880]  But you're missing opportunities in my opinion.
[30:50.880 --> 30:54.000]  That one extra week of feeding is a missed opportunity
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.520]  if you don't give it nutrients.
[30:56.440 --> 30:59.080]  I would not go with just Shine to the end.
[30:59.080 --> 31:00.480]  I would add some base nutrients,
[31:00.480 --> 31:01.780]  whatever else you think you need.
[31:01.780 --> 31:04.000]  Maybe a light bloom booster with the Shine
[31:04.000 --> 31:04.880]  will really chunk it up.
[31:04.880 --> 31:06.820]  As long as you do give it the flush period
[31:06.820 --> 31:08.480]  of just water at the end.
[31:08.480 --> 31:10.240]  So I guess if you've got a nine week plant
[31:10.240 --> 31:13.160]  and you're running hydro or cocoa,
[31:13.160 --> 31:16.280]  add the two grams of Shine up to week eight
[31:16.280 --> 31:18.800]  along with your base newt, along with the bloom booster.
[31:18.800 --> 31:21.640]  Maybe you might need cow mag at that point, I don't know.
[31:21.640 --> 31:23.400]  I've noticed if you use too much cow mag,
[31:23.400 --> 31:25.980]  too late in flower, you can fucking definitely taste it.
[31:25.980 --> 31:27.440]  So be careful on that.
[31:27.440 --> 31:30.040]  But use that stuff up to week seven or eight.
[31:30.040 --> 31:33.080]  And then week nine should just be clean water all flush.
[31:33.080 --> 31:34.400]  That's how I would do it.
[31:34.400 --> 31:37.040]  I wouldn't wanna put the Shine in there for the last week.
[31:37.040 --> 31:38.940]  I just don't find it necessary.
[31:38.940 --> 31:40.260]  And I don't wanna taste it.
[31:40.260 --> 31:42.140]  And I don't want my buds to burn weird.
[31:42.140 --> 31:44.620]  So if you've got nine weeks, feed it for seven,
[31:44.620 --> 31:47.420]  maybe give it Shine for week eight, then flush.
[31:47.420 --> 31:49.940]  But that does greatly depend on your medium, you guys.
[31:49.940 --> 31:52.640]  Like I said, any type of like a hydro stuff,
[31:52.640 --> 31:55.100]  you can feed it up to that week before flush.
[31:55.100 --> 31:57.580]  If you're in soilless mix, give yourself two weeks.
[31:57.580 --> 32:00.540]  You don't wanna taste cow mag, you don't wanna taste Shine.
[32:00.540 --> 32:02.420]  You don't wanna taste any of these funky things.
[32:02.420 --> 32:03.440]  I'm not sure what's in Shine.
[32:03.440 --> 32:05.020]  I don't know how long it'll stick around,
[32:05.020 --> 32:08.060]  how heavy it is, how hard it is to flush out.
[32:08.060 --> 32:09.380]  I don't want it to make your buds burn.
[32:09.380 --> 32:10.840]  I wouldn't risk it.
[32:10.840 --> 32:12.820]  All right, I hope I answered your question clearly.
[32:12.820 --> 32:14.020]  There's a lot of information there.
[32:14.020 --> 32:15.240]  I had a lot to say.
[32:15.240 --> 32:18.140]  If I just sparked more questions, feel free to email me.
