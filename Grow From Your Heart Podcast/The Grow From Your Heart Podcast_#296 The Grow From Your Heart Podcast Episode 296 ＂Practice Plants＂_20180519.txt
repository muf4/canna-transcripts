[00:02.490 --> 00:05.450]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:05.450 --> 00:08.330]  It's time for a Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:08.330 --> 00:12.530]  I like to call these Thursday episodes the Thursday Quickie.
[00:12.530 --> 00:15.730]  These quickies are brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[00:15.730 --> 00:17.930]  Make sure you check them out at dankseed.store.
[00:17.930 --> 00:22.610]  Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a quickie unless we get started right away, so let's
[00:22.610 --> 00:24.450]  get on with the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:24.450 --> 00:29.050]  Welcome to the show, and thanks again for joining me, Podcast World.
[00:29.050 --> 00:30.610]  This is going to be a quick one.
[00:30.610 --> 00:32.970]  I like to let you guys know what I'm smoking on to start the show.
[00:32.970 --> 00:38.130]  Today, I am smoking on some cantaloupe haze batter from our friends at the Garden of Wheaton.
[00:38.130 --> 00:42.730]  It's got a super sweet cantaloupe smell, a really nice cantaloupe flavor, and the look
[00:42.730 --> 00:44.250]  and texture of this are just amazing.
[00:44.250 --> 00:49.510]  It's like ... I keep saying cheesecake, but it's like cheesecake or cream cheese with
[00:49.510 --> 00:53.730]  a golden yellow color, and then the edges of it have just a little bit of turps seeping
[00:53.730 --> 00:54.730]  out.
[00:54.730 --> 00:55.730]  It is gorgeous.
[00:55.730 --> 00:59.410]  Shout out to my friends at the Garden of Wheaton for the great cantaloupe extracts.
[01:00.410 --> 01:01.410]  It's been making my day.
[01:01.410 --> 01:02.610]  All right, that's what I'm smoking on.
[01:02.610 --> 01:05.770]  Let's move forward and get into some iTunes comments.
[01:05.770 --> 01:08.090]  I love ratings and reviews on iTunes.
[01:08.090 --> 01:09.570]  I have got ... Let's scroll up and see.
[01:09.570 --> 01:10.570]  There are a lot of them here.
[01:10.570 --> 01:12.890]  I'm using the iPad, so it's not as easy as it should be.
[01:12.890 --> 01:14.850]  There are 97 ratings and reviews.
[01:14.850 --> 01:18.250]  So far, everybody has given me a five-star review.
[01:18.250 --> 01:20.730]  So if you'd like to give me a review, they've made it real easy.
[01:20.730 --> 01:24.650]  Now, while you're listening to the podcast, if you're on iTunes, scroll down to the available
[01:24.650 --> 01:25.650]  episodes.
[01:25.650 --> 01:29.310]  Eventually, it'll show you the ratings and reviews right there in the podcast app right
[01:30.210 --> 01:31.750]  where you're looking at my show right at my home screen.
[01:31.750 --> 01:32.750]  Just scroll down.
[01:32.750 --> 01:33.750]  You'll find it.
[01:33.750 --> 01:35.790]  Just go there, and you can write a rating and a review.
[01:35.790 --> 01:40.030]  So far, like I said, everybody is giving me a five-star rating.
[01:40.030 --> 01:43.430]  So far, everybody has written quite a positive review.
[01:43.430 --> 01:49.010]  I'm not sure if I read this last one here on the show or not, so we're going to do it
[01:49.010 --> 01:50.010]  right now.
[01:50.010 --> 01:51.010]  It goes like this.
[01:51.010 --> 01:52.010]  Love the show.
[01:52.010 --> 01:53.010]  They gave me five stars, of course.
[01:53.010 --> 01:58.530]  It's from a person that calls themselves Rogers1023, and he says, or they say, just like all the
[01:58.530 --> 02:02.770]  good books out there, including all the Jeff Lohenfels teaming books, your stories and
[02:02.770 --> 02:06.130]  insight help in so many ways for first-time growers.
[02:06.130 --> 02:10.010]  Thumbs up to your guests also for all the insight, for all the info they share.
[02:10.010 --> 02:13.090]  Thumbs up to Jesse too for all of the info he shares.
[02:13.090 --> 02:15.330]  It feels like I might have read that, but I'm not sure.
[02:15.330 --> 02:20.210]  So big shout out to our friend Rogers1023 for the great customer review and, of course,
[02:20.210 --> 02:21.210]  the five-star rating.
[02:21.210 --> 02:23.810]  I'm going to move right into the next customer review.
[02:23.810 --> 02:27.050]  This one is left by a person that calls themselves Grogang420.
[02:27.050 --> 02:28.050]  Shout out to Grogang420.
[02:28.570 --> 02:29.570]  They follow me on Instagram also.
[02:29.570 --> 02:31.410]  Thanks for all the support.
[02:31.410 --> 02:33.530]  They said, best cannabis information out there.
[02:33.530 --> 02:38.250]  They gave me a five-star review or a five-star rating, and the review goes like this.
[02:38.250 --> 02:42.650]  Ross DeJeff hosts one of the coolest, most down-to-earth podcasts around.
[02:42.650 --> 02:47.410]  He has no problem answering questions or giving out his methods, tips, and tricks.
[02:47.410 --> 02:52.750]  Easily in my top five podcasts I listen to, from guiding beginners on grow tips to helping
[02:52.750 --> 02:56.790]  advanced growers reach that next level and informing all in prohibition land what's going
[02:56.790 --> 02:59.310]  on with the legalization of cannabis.
[02:59.310 --> 03:03.030]  Very informative, and he makes sure to do his homework and not give out any false information.
[03:03.030 --> 03:04.510]  Dude, I'm glad you noticed that part.
[03:04.510 --> 03:05.510]  Thank you.
[03:05.510 --> 03:08.230]  I try to be really careful to not steer you guys in the wrong direction because that would
[03:08.230 --> 03:09.990]  make me feel like shit.
[03:09.990 --> 03:10.990]  Where else was I?
[03:10.990 --> 03:13.950]  Perfect balance of grow talk, news, and information.
[03:13.950 --> 03:15.270]  Just caught up on the old episodes.
[03:15.270 --> 03:19.150]  Honestly, feel like with each episode I'm a better grower and a better human being.
[03:19.150 --> 03:21.190]  Holy shit, that's a huge compliment, dude.
[03:21.190 --> 03:22.830]  Every episode makes you a better grower.
[03:22.830 --> 03:23.830]  Thank you.
[03:23.830 --> 03:24.830]  That means a lot to me.
[03:24.830 --> 03:26.270]  The review keeps going.
[03:26.270 --> 03:29.950]  It says, keep up the good vibes, Jeff, and don't forget we like it when you ramble.
[03:29.950 --> 03:33.270]  I'll be sure to take a fat dab and give my mom a hug.
[03:33.270 --> 03:34.870]  Hey, Grow Gang, thank you for the dope review.
[03:34.870 --> 03:36.630]  I appreciate that.
[03:36.630 --> 03:39.550]  I'll try to do more rambling for you, but I try to keep the shows tight.
[03:39.550 --> 03:41.350]  I catch myself on too many rants.
[03:41.350 --> 03:45.310]  If you really want to catch me ranting, I think Instagram Live is the place for that.
[03:45.310 --> 03:46.310]  That's right.
[03:46.310 --> 03:47.310]  You can find me on Instagram Live.
[03:47.310 --> 03:53.910]  I'm Irie underscore genetics, I-R-I-E underscore G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S on Instagram, Irie underscore
[03:53.910 --> 03:54.910]  genetics.
[03:54.910 --> 03:55.910]  Catch my live feeds.
[03:55.910 --> 03:56.910]  I'm ranting there.
[03:56.910 --> 03:59.990]  Of course, Grow Gang already follows me there, so thanks for that.
[03:59.990 --> 04:03.510]  Also thanks for the great review and the great five-star rating.
[04:03.510 --> 04:06.190]  I've got one more rating and review that I'd like to read.
[04:06.190 --> 04:10.630]  This one came from a person that called themselves Lone Starred, and they gave me five stars,
[04:10.630 --> 04:14.550]  of course, and the headline says, nothing better, and the review goes like this.
[04:14.550 --> 04:17.990]  It says, thanks for all of your insight into the culture, the cultivation, and everything
[04:17.990 --> 04:19.030]  A to Z.
[04:19.030 --> 04:23.430]  I've listened to several different podcasts on the subject, and yours is hands down absolutely
[04:23.430 --> 04:25.210]  the cream of the crop.
[04:25.210 --> 04:26.970]  Thanks for keeping Mondays constant.
[04:26.970 --> 04:30.890]  Being from a misinformed state, it makes it a bit more difficult to learn hands on.
[04:30.890 --> 04:34.090]  With that being said, I live vicariously through your podcasts.
[04:34.090 --> 04:36.130]  I truly appreciate what you do.
[04:36.130 --> 04:38.010]  Thanks from the Lone Star State.
[04:38.010 --> 04:41.890]  Hey, Lone Starred, I think I actually read your email on another episode also, because
[04:41.890 --> 04:43.290]  I remember saying your name.
[04:43.290 --> 04:46.970]  Dude, thanks for the great review, and thanks for all the interaction.
[04:46.970 --> 04:48.530]  I appreciate all the support, you guys.
[04:48.530 --> 04:49.610]  Thanks a lot.
[04:49.610 --> 04:52.010]  Let's keep the show moving so we can keep it quick.
[04:52.010 --> 04:55.610]  I have got an email that I would like to read and share with you guys.
[04:55.610 --> 04:57.850]  This one comes from our friend, Saint Skinny.
[04:57.850 --> 05:01.490]  Saint Skinny and I try to interact a lot on social media and through email.
[05:01.490 --> 05:03.370]  He's been listening to the show for a long time.
[05:03.370 --> 05:05.410]  Shout out to Saint Skinny and also to Mama Skinny.
[05:05.410 --> 05:07.090]  I hope you guys are doing well.
[05:07.090 --> 05:09.250]  The email goes a lot like this.
[05:09.250 --> 05:11.650]  Hey, Broski, just wanted to pop in real quick.
[05:11.650 --> 05:12.650]  That's perfect.
[05:12.650 --> 05:13.650]  It's a quick episode.
[05:13.650 --> 05:16.890]  Wanted to pop in real quick to give a little piece of advice for new growers that I wish
[05:16.890 --> 05:18.810]  I would have gotten when I started.
[05:18.810 --> 05:20.810]  That is to grow other kinds of plants.
[05:20.850 --> 05:21.850]  All right.
[05:21.850 --> 05:25.170]  Saint Skinny says to grow other kinds of plants, and he wishes that someone would have taught
[05:25.170 --> 05:27.450]  him this early on in his grow career.
[05:27.450 --> 05:31.450]  He says, even just growing some small peppers or herbs in containers on your porch can give
[05:31.450 --> 05:35.490]  you an opportunity to try some things you may not be willing to try on a plant you're
[05:35.490 --> 05:38.090]  counting on to produce your medicine.
[05:38.090 --> 05:41.770]  An example, maybe you've been wanting to try manifold training or mainlining or some other
[05:41.770 --> 05:44.850]  training technique, but you're afraid to break or kill your plant.
[05:44.850 --> 05:46.250]  You can try it with another plant.
[05:46.250 --> 05:49.090]  Just remember that not every plant grows the same way.
[05:49.090 --> 05:53.210]  In most cases, you want to stick with something that grows similarly to cannabis.
[05:53.210 --> 05:58.090]  An example, Echinacea grows nothing like cannabis, but rosemary, lemon balm, and many other plants
[05:58.090 --> 06:01.250]  have a similar structure and a similar response to topping.
[06:01.250 --> 06:07.090]  Not to mention, these two particular plants are also said to have pest repellent properties.
[06:07.090 --> 06:10.650]  They may not grow or respond exactly like cannabis would, but it's a great place to
[06:10.650 --> 06:14.770]  start and may end up rewarding your efforts in the long run.
[06:14.770 --> 06:16.550]  So that's a great idea, you guys.
[06:16.550 --> 06:18.890]  You don't have to stick to growing only cannabis.
[06:18.890 --> 06:22.490]  A lot of you are already growing other stuff outdoors in your outdoor garden, but why not
[06:22.490 --> 06:25.530]  just set up a small container garden on your porch?
[06:25.530 --> 06:29.170]  Maybe use a small bit of space in the backyard, or you can just do containers wherever.
[06:29.170 --> 06:33.250]  You can set them up wherever you can fit a few containers that animals like dogs and
[06:33.250 --> 06:36.050]  cats aren't going to get to and try to eat your small plants.
[06:36.050 --> 06:41.690]  But some tomatoes, it looks like he said some rosemary, some lemon balm, things like that.
[06:41.690 --> 06:45.970]  Any types of herbs or small plants would be fun to grow, and you can experiment with them.
[06:45.970 --> 06:49.490]  If you kill a tomato plant, it's not going to be as detrimental as if you kill your indoor
[06:49.490 --> 06:50.490]  ganja plant.
[06:50.490 --> 06:51.810]  It's not going to break your heart as much.
[06:51.810 --> 06:52.810]  Maybe it will.
[06:52.810 --> 06:56.890]  Maybe you're that type of person, but it's not going to risk your cannabis garden, and
[06:56.890 --> 07:01.150]  you're going to be able to take more risks because you're not putting so much electricity
[07:01.150 --> 07:05.370]  and space and energy and effort into these outdoor tester plants as you are that indoor
[07:05.370 --> 07:09.290]  cannabis garden where you're feeding it the expensive nutrients and running the expensive
[07:09.290 --> 07:10.290]  lights.
[07:10.290 --> 07:14.010]  So don't be afraid to experiment with some small outdoor plants that are not cannabis.
[07:14.010 --> 07:15.850]  And it will also teach you about growing.
[07:15.850 --> 07:18.530]  You'll just get a better appreciation for growing in general.
[07:18.530 --> 07:23.650]  You'll appreciate the art of growing, the nature of growing, the process, the cycle.
[07:23.650 --> 07:27.690]  You will develop a better relationship with nature, the plants, yourself, your cannabis
[07:27.690 --> 07:29.050]  plants, the bugs.
[07:29.050 --> 07:30.370]  It'll all just feel better.
[07:30.370 --> 07:32.430]  It'll just be more growing and growing feels good.
[07:32.430 --> 07:35.930]  It's connecting to the earth, to the nature, to what we should be doing as humans.
[07:35.930 --> 07:38.130]  It gets you away from the computer for a little bit.
[07:38.130 --> 07:40.370]  It gets you away from your social media.
[07:40.370 --> 07:42.050]  It gets you out of the car.
[07:42.050 --> 07:44.210]  It's just a place to be zen, and it's good for you.
[07:44.210 --> 07:46.130]  It's good for the environment and you're learning something.
[07:46.130 --> 07:47.610]  So great idea, dude.
[07:47.610 --> 07:48.810]  The email also has more.
[07:48.810 --> 07:54.970]  He says on another yet related note, since the episode about synthetics versus organics
[07:54.970 --> 07:58.530]  wasn't too long ago, which at this point it was kind of a while ago, I apologize.
[07:58.530 --> 08:00.370]  I get a lot of emails.
[08:00.370 --> 08:04.750]  He says, I thought I'd mentioned a few products that may make trying organics easier for some
[08:04.750 --> 08:06.890]  of the people wanting to give it a shot.
[08:06.890 --> 08:11.370]  The one I have experience with is a three part pre-mixed organic dry nutrient from roots
[08:11.370 --> 08:16.770]  organics called the uprising line, which consists of uprising grow, uprising foundation,
[08:16.770 --> 08:18.410]  and uprising bloom.
[08:18.410 --> 08:24.370]  They're each different blends of kelp and other meals, green sand, rock dust, guanos,
[08:24.370 --> 08:27.170]  and all other sorts of funky goodness.
[08:27.170 --> 08:30.610]  Down to earth also makes mixes that are similar and cheaper, but I haven't tried any of these
[08:30.610 --> 08:35.770]  myself just because when I was buying amendments, the place I was shopping did not carry them.
[08:35.770 --> 08:39.870]  As far as the uprising, this spring I planted a variety of veggies and herbs with the uprising
[08:39.870 --> 08:42.310]  line, some castings and pro mix.
[08:42.310 --> 08:46.830]  This was my organics test to see if I would try this mix with my MJ plants.
[08:46.830 --> 08:50.030]  I couldn't believe how fast those darn things grew.
[08:50.030 --> 08:53.630]  After a couple months, I felt comfortable trying it out with one of my MJ plants and
[08:53.630 --> 08:55.550]  I was impressed with the results.
[08:55.550 --> 09:00.310]  So it sounds like he just gave us some advice on some products we can buy to grow organically
[09:00.310 --> 09:04.030]  for the folks that want to go organic because we did an organic episode.
[09:04.030 --> 09:07.650]  We talked about how it could be messy and it could be more work, but it looks like this
[09:07.650 --> 09:13.170]  guy's found a three part solution that will make organic growing very easy.
[09:13.170 --> 09:16.930]  He said he mixed it with, what did he mix it with?
[09:16.930 --> 09:19.970]  Some pro mix and some worm castings using the uprising line.
[09:19.970 --> 09:21.970]  So I'm not paid to endorse the uprising line.
[09:21.970 --> 09:24.810]  I don't think St. Skinny is paid to endorse anything either.
[09:24.810 --> 09:27.230]  He's simply sharing an experience with us.
[09:27.230 --> 09:30.090]  It's probably an easy line to get ahold of also.
[09:30.090 --> 09:34.190]  Roots Organics is a fairly popular brand and I'm sure that most of your growth stores are
[09:34.190 --> 09:39.270]  going to have the uprising products and if not, I'm sure they're very easy to get.
[09:39.270 --> 09:40.390]  So there's more to the email.
[09:40.390 --> 09:42.750]  He says, sorry for making it such a long email.
[09:42.750 --> 09:47.230]  I took a double dab of some bomb ass critical cush BHO that's got me all sorts of goofy
[09:47.230 --> 09:49.990]  in the best possible way.
[09:49.990 --> 09:51.070]  Keep doing what you do my friend.
[09:51.070 --> 09:54.310]  You really make a positive impact on a lot of people.
[09:54.310 --> 09:56.510]  I hope all is well with you and yours.
[09:56.510 --> 09:58.110]  Growers love St. Skinny.
[09:58.110 --> 10:01.150]  Hey Skinny, no need to apologize for such a good email.
[10:01.150 --> 10:02.310]  It was a lot of good advice.
[10:02.310 --> 10:06.310]  You gave us recommendation on organic nutrients that we can use that are probably available
[10:06.310 --> 10:10.470]  and affordable to most growers and you also gave us a way that we could practice growing
[10:10.470 --> 10:13.350]  without ruining our precious cannabis plant.
[10:13.350 --> 10:14.550]  So I appreciate you for that.
[10:14.550 --> 10:20.670]  Hey dude, take another double dab for me and then be sure to give Mama St. a big fat hug
[10:20.670 --> 10:21.670]  for me.
[10:21.670 --> 10:22.670]  Growers love brother.
[10:22.670 --> 10:23.670]  Thanks for the email.
[10:23.670 --> 10:25.510]  You guys, if you want to send me an email, I would appreciate it.
[10:25.510 --> 10:30.470]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[10:30.470 --> 10:31.470]  You can send me an email.
[10:31.630 --> 10:35.030]  Maybe I will read your email on a future episode.
[10:35.030 --> 10:37.110]  Now's a good time to remind you guys about Patreon.

[10:45.110 --> 10:46.550]  out my Patreon campaign.

[10:55.610 --> 10:57.210]  where the funding is going.
[10:57.210 --> 10:59.950]  So if you're interested in helping out, I would appreciate the help.
[10:59.950 --> 11:04.350]  The MacBook is starting to take a poop on me, so it's almost time to replace that.
[11:04.350 --> 11:08.590]  Patreon.com slash growfromyourheart and I would appreciate the support.
[11:08.590 --> 11:09.590]  All right.
[11:09.590 --> 11:14.110]  I've got one more thing I want to talk about before I start wrapping up this podcast.
[11:14.110 --> 11:16.670]  Somebody asked me a question a few days ago and I'm not going to get into the question,
[11:16.670 --> 11:18.030]  but I asked them, why?
[11:18.030 --> 11:19.990]  Why do you want to do that to your plants?
[11:19.990 --> 11:23.630]  And they kind of gave me a short explanation of why they thought they might want to do
[11:23.630 --> 11:24.630]  it.
[11:24.630 --> 11:27.230]  And then I had to explain to them why what they were doing wasn't a good idea, which
[11:27.230 --> 11:29.470]  is that's a perfectly normal situation.
[11:29.470 --> 11:31.350]  You should say, Hey, I'm thinking about doing something.
[11:31.350 --> 11:34.630]  Ask somebody with more experience, get some advice, see what's going on.
[11:34.630 --> 11:39.310]  Now, my advice, every time you're thinking about doing something to your cannabis plants,
[11:39.310 --> 11:41.550]  think to yourself, why am I doing this?
[11:41.550 --> 11:43.310]  What is my intention?
[11:43.310 --> 11:46.950]  I want to walk in there and do this weird thing to my plant that I saw on the internet.
[11:46.950 --> 11:47.950]  Why?
[11:47.950 --> 11:48.950]  What's your goal?
[11:48.950 --> 11:49.950]  What are you going to do?
[11:49.950 --> 11:51.830]  What are you trying to learn?
[11:51.830 --> 11:55.110]  Whatever you're going to do to that plant today, you're not going to see unless you
[11:55.110 --> 11:57.150]  take scissors to it and cut a piece off.
[11:57.150 --> 11:59.750]  You're going to see that immediately and that's irreversible.
[11:59.750 --> 12:01.710]  If you fucked up doing that, you're fucked.
[12:01.710 --> 12:04.750]  You got to watch it fix itself and grow up from there.
[12:04.750 --> 12:08.090]  Most other things, feeding sprays, they're going to take a little bit of time to show
[12:08.090 --> 12:09.350]  you the results.
[12:09.350 --> 12:12.910]  So if you feed it something weird today, you're not going to see that for maybe two, three,
[12:12.910 --> 12:14.610]  maybe five or seven days.
[12:14.610 --> 12:16.950]  If you spray something, you might see it immediately.
[12:16.950 --> 12:19.470]  You might not see it for two, three, five, seven days.
[12:19.470 --> 12:20.830]  You're going to have to pay attention.
[12:20.830 --> 12:24.890]  So think about why am I doing what I'm going to do to my plants?
[12:24.890 --> 12:28.070]  If you read something on the internet and it sounds like a good idea, or if some dude
[12:28.070 --> 12:32.250]  at the grow store told you some shit and it sounds like a good idea, go think long and
[12:32.250 --> 12:33.830]  hard about why.
[12:33.830 --> 12:38.490]  Go sit in your grow room silently by yourself and stare at the plants and think, why would
[12:38.490 --> 12:39.730]  I want to do this to my plants?
[12:39.730 --> 12:41.050]  Now, don't be afraid.
[12:41.050 --> 12:46.890]  If it makes sense, if it's logical, if it's got a future, try it out.
[12:46.890 --> 12:48.010]  That's how I became a good grower.
[12:48.010 --> 12:49.850]  I took some risks.
[12:49.850 --> 12:53.910]  I read, but I also did my own research and thought long and hard before I did something
[12:53.930 --> 12:55.870]  to my precious crop.
[12:55.870 --> 12:59.870]  So what St. Skinny told us earlier, to try some stuff on some other plants, that kind
[12:59.870 --> 13:01.230]  of ties in with what I'm saying.
[13:01.230 --> 13:05.990]  Practice on other plants if you've got the opportunity, but still think about it.
[13:05.990 --> 13:08.930]  Think about it before you do anything because a lot of things you're going to do to your
[13:08.930 --> 13:13.350]  plants are irreversible and you put a lot of time, a lot of love, a lot of energy, and
[13:13.350 --> 13:17.070]  a lot of money into these plants and a lot of you are doing it illegally, so you're risking
[13:17.070 --> 13:18.390]  your fucking life for it.
[13:18.390 --> 13:20.750]  So think about it before you ruin stuff.
[13:20.750 --> 13:25.750]  But again, don't be afraid to get in there and try something new.
[13:25.750 --> 13:29.870]  So if you're going to do something weird, if you get this weird idea, if you and your
[13:29.870 --> 13:32.790]  buddy are like, bro, what if we do this?
[13:32.790 --> 13:33.790]  Slow down.
[13:33.790 --> 13:38.350]  If you're already smoking a joint, go eat a couple of burritos, chill out for a minute,
[13:38.350 --> 13:39.390]  think the idea through again.
[13:39.390 --> 13:42.610]  If you haven't smoked a joint yet, go for a walk and smoke a joint.
[13:42.610 --> 13:44.590]  Then go sit down and think the idea through again.
[13:44.590 --> 13:45.630]  Just think about what you're doing.
[13:45.630 --> 13:47.470]  Have a reason for it.
[13:47.470 --> 13:49.430]  Have a reason why you're going to do that today.
[13:49.430 --> 13:51.630]  What's going to happen in three days from what you did?
[13:51.630 --> 13:52.990]  What's going to happen in five days?
[13:52.990 --> 13:54.750]  What's going to happen in two weeks?
[13:54.750 --> 13:57.430]  How is this going to affect your grow in a month?
[13:57.430 --> 13:58.910]  Is this going to affect your harvest?
[13:58.910 --> 14:00.670]  Is it going to affect your yield?
[14:00.670 --> 14:03.070]  Is it going to affect potency, quality?
[14:03.070 --> 14:05.310]  Are you trying to do something stupid or are you trying to do something that's going to
[14:05.310 --> 14:06.430]  improve the crop?
[14:06.430 --> 14:07.710]  Think about it from your heart.
[14:07.710 --> 14:09.510]  Don't think about it from your wallet.
[14:09.510 --> 14:10.510]  Think about it logically.
[14:10.510 --> 14:12.790]  All right, you guys, that's my rant for the end of this podcast.
[14:12.790 --> 14:14.910]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[14:14.910 --> 14:16.030]  Thanks for all the support.
[14:16.030 --> 14:17.030]  Thanks for all of the interaction.
[14:17.030 --> 14:18.590]  My social media has been going crazy.
[14:18.590 --> 14:20.350]  My email has been exploding.
[14:20.350 --> 14:22.470]  I've been getting more listens and more listens.
[14:22.470 --> 14:24.270]  The Patreon has been blowing up.
[14:24.270 --> 14:25.270]  Thank you.

[14:26.270 --> 14:28.190]  I put a lot of work into this podcast.
[14:28.190 --> 14:32.350]  All of the interaction and all of the support makes it worth my time and energy.
[14:32.350 --> 14:34.470]  All right, I'm going to wrap it up.
[14:34.470 --> 14:37.830]  Don't forget that the Helladank Seed Bank is having a huge 420 sale.
[14:37.830 --> 14:38.830]  That's right.

[14:44.030 --> 14:46.790]  The five pack will be something I selected from the vault.
[14:46.790 --> 14:50.270]  It'll be some IRIE Genetics secret stash that's never been released.
[14:50.270 --> 14:51.310]  It'll be a limited release.
[14:51.310 --> 14:52.590]  There won't be a lot of it.
[14:52.590 --> 14:58.550]  So make sure you get your hands on that one at the Helladank Seed Company at dankseed.store.
