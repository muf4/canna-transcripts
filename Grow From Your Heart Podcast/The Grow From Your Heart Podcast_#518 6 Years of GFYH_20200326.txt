[00:00.000 --> 00:02.200]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[00:02.200 --> 00:06.600]  It is time for episode 518 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.600 --> 00:08.720]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:08.720 --> 00:10.180]  Thank you for joining me.

[00:47.440 --> 00:50.880]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:50.880 --> 00:56.240]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Orange Skittles Live Batter from Apothecary Farms.
[00:56.240 --> 01:01.560]  On the package, it says the product contains 77.2% total cannabinoids.
[01:01.560 --> 01:07.000]  The best way I can describe this product is when I open the jar, it smells like a bag
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.360]  of sour Skittles sitting next to some funky, greasy oranges.
[01:11.360 --> 01:18.200]  I love this delicious, sour, orangey smell, and I absolutely love the buzz I get from
[01:18.200 --> 01:19.200]  the orange Skittles.
[01:19.200 --> 01:21.040]  It makes me nice and talkative.
[01:21.040 --> 01:22.920]  It puts me in a good, friendly mood.
[01:22.920 --> 01:26.200]  It is going to be perfect podcast concentrate.
[01:26.200 --> 01:32.600]  So big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the Orange Skittles Live Batter.
[01:32.600 --> 01:35.840]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I do have a great show lined up for
[01:35.840 --> 01:36.840]  you.
[01:36.840 --> 01:40.960]  Before we get to the main topic of the show, let's do some shout outs to a few of the folks
[01:40.960 --> 01:43.520]  who support us on Patreon.
[01:43.520 --> 01:47.240]  Let's start off by rolling up a big fat joint for our buddy, Ned Denver.
[01:47.240 --> 01:51.720]  Let's send a big shout out to Zoso J. I always want to send a big high five and a fist bump
[01:51.720 --> 01:53.600]  to my buddy, Glenn Gironi.
[01:53.600 --> 01:56.160]  Let's roll up a big fat joint for Dick Goals.
[01:56.160 --> 01:59.720]  I always want to send a fresh bong rip over to my buddy, Gramps Memel.
[01:59.720 --> 02:02.640]  We've always got a fat dab for my buddy, Fat Rabbit.
[02:02.640 --> 02:06.160]  I always want to send a big thank you shout out and a fist bump and a handshake to Todd
[02:06.160 --> 02:10.560]  K. Let's send a big hug and roll up a fat joint to Growing Granny.
[02:10.560 --> 02:15.480]  I always want to send a big thank you shout out and a fat dab to Michael W. And last,
[02:15.480 --> 02:20.160]  but certainly not least, let's bake a fresh batch of edibles and send a big thank you
[02:20.160 --> 02:24.040]  shout out to my big buddy, Stabby McStabberson.
[02:24.040 --> 02:29.040]  Big thanks, big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[02:49.520 --> 02:50.520]  All right.
[02:50.520 --> 02:53.240]  I feel like I've got all of the business handled.
[02:53.440 --> 02:56.600]  I like to handle the business right at the top of the show so that we can sit back and
[02:56.600 --> 02:58.640]  relax and have fun on the show.
[02:58.640 --> 03:04.080]  And this episode is going to be extra fun because it is our birthday episode.
[03:04.080 --> 03:10.120]  This episode will come out on March 26th and on March 28th, it will be the podcast's sixth
[03:10.120 --> 03:11.120]  birthday.
[03:11.120 --> 03:12.200]  That's right.
[03:12.200 --> 03:17.960]  The first episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast came out on March 28th, 2014.
[03:17.960 --> 03:22.640]  So we have been doing this for six years, ladies and gentlemen, six years.
[03:22.640 --> 03:24.280]  I have not missed a Monday.
[03:24.280 --> 03:26.840]  I've been fairly consistent with the Thursdays.
[03:26.840 --> 03:29.880]  I have been having a great time and I could not have done it.
[03:29.880 --> 03:33.760]  I would not have done it without you and all of the support.
[03:33.760 --> 03:35.120]  So thank you.
[03:35.120 --> 03:36.720]  Thanks for all of the emails.
[03:36.720 --> 03:38.280]  Thanks for all of the messages.
[03:38.280 --> 03:39.920]  Thanks for all of the YouTube comments.
[03:39.920 --> 03:44.880]  Thanks for all the iTunes comments and extra big thanks for all of the support on Patreon.
[03:44.880 --> 03:48.840]  And of course, all of the support with my other endeavors, whatever that is, if it's
[03:48.840 --> 03:53.920]  I read genetics, if it's podcasting, if it's the Instagram live stuff, thank you guys for
[03:53.920 --> 03:55.160]  all of the support.
[03:55.160 --> 03:57.680]  You guys really make my life wonderful.
[03:57.680 --> 04:00.320]  Without you guys, my life would not be what it is.
[04:00.320 --> 04:03.280]  And I see it, I appreciate it, and I respect it.
[04:03.280 --> 04:07.400]  So big thank you to everybody for the continued support.
[04:07.400 --> 04:11.340]  We recently hit episode 500, which felt like a huge milestone.
[04:11.340 --> 04:15.680]  And now we are at six years of podcasting, which feels like another huge milestone.
[04:15.680 --> 04:18.080]  I really see no end in sight, you guys.
[04:18.120 --> 04:22.600]  I am going to keep podcasting as long as I've got a voice, a microphone, and a couple of
[04:22.600 --> 04:27.120]  good toys to play with, and we've got the internet, I will keep putting out quality
[04:27.120 --> 04:28.120]  podcasts.
[04:28.120 --> 04:34.440]  So thank you for the support and look forward to many more years of continued quality podcasting.
[04:34.440 --> 04:39.200]  I feel like at this point in time, at this state of affairs, in this weird situation
[04:39.200 --> 04:44.600]  in the world, I feel like content providers and content creators will be a big part of
[04:44.600 --> 04:47.040]  what get us through these strange times.
[04:47.080 --> 04:50.200]  A lot of our entertainment avenues have been shut down.
[04:50.200 --> 04:54.640]  We can't go to comedy clubs, we can't go see live music, the bars have been closed, the
[04:54.640 --> 04:56.360]  restaurants have been closed.
[04:56.360 --> 04:59.980]  We're all facing weird times because of this coronavirus.
[04:59.980 --> 05:05.680]  So I think that people are going to turn to podcasts and YouTube and other forms of entertainment
[05:05.680 --> 05:07.120]  to keep them sane.
[05:07.120 --> 05:12.680]  So I am going to do my best to keep quality podcasting coming until there is a major reason
[05:12.680 --> 05:13.740]  for me to stop.
[05:13.740 --> 05:14.920]  They're going to have to stop me.
[05:14.920 --> 05:16.880]  They're going to have to take this microphone away.
[05:16.920 --> 05:18.400]  They're going to have to take my toys away.
[05:18.400 --> 05:22.080]  I'm going to do it till the end because I know that people are relying on me, not just
[05:22.080 --> 05:23.960]  to keep their gardens up to speed.
[05:23.960 --> 05:27.580]  At this point in time, we're relying on each other just for sanity.
[05:27.580 --> 05:30.240]  I'm doing podcasts to fill the time.
[05:30.240 --> 05:34.280]  We're doing a little self-quarantine, a little social distancing.
[05:34.280 --> 05:36.280]  During that time, I won't see a lot of my friends.
[05:36.280 --> 05:38.800]  I won't be going out and about like I normally do.
[05:38.800 --> 05:42.400]  So I will have more opportunity to sit here and focus on better podcasting.
[05:42.400 --> 05:46.760]  And I'm going to make an effort to do that because I know you need that at this time.
[05:46.760 --> 05:49.920]  I'm getting a lot of my social interaction through social media.
[05:49.920 --> 05:51.880]  I do Instagram live videos.
[05:51.880 --> 05:53.600]  I go watch my friends' videos.
[05:53.600 --> 05:55.200]  I've been FaceTiming more.
[05:55.200 --> 05:59.640]  We're going to have to find better ways, safer ways, different ways, alternative ways to
[05:59.640 --> 06:03.120]  communicate, to socialize, and get our entertainment.
[06:03.120 --> 06:08.200]  And I really feel like it is time for podcasters and content providers to step up and fill
[06:08.200 --> 06:08.760]  that gap.
[06:08.760 --> 06:09.840]  We're stuck at home.
[06:09.840 --> 06:12.840]  We might as well produce better content for you.
[06:12.840 --> 06:13.800]  So here we are.
[06:13.800 --> 06:14.440]  Thank you.
[06:14.440 --> 06:15.680]  I'm going to keep it going.
[06:15.680 --> 06:19.600]  I feel like I've been really ranty on a couple of episodes lately, but we've been faced with
[06:19.600 --> 06:22.760]  a lot of weird things and I've got a lot of weird shit on my mind.
[06:22.760 --> 06:26.320]  And maybe since I'm not getting out and seeing my friends and my friends aren't coming here,
[06:26.320 --> 06:28.920]  maybe I'm just extra talkative when I turn on the mic.
[06:28.920 --> 06:31.400]  Just got a lot of shit to say, it feels like.
[06:31.400 --> 06:33.560]  These are crazy times, you guys.
[06:33.560 --> 06:37.440]  And if you think about it, we are a big part of history.
[06:37.440 --> 06:42.160]  If you are here listening to this podcast, you have gotten to see a lot of monumental
[06:42.160 --> 06:46.600]  moments in history, world history, American history.
[06:46.600 --> 06:50.600]  If you're here listening, you are seeing the legalization of cannabis.
[06:50.600 --> 06:54.600]  Right now, that is way on the back burner of everybody's mind for the next couple of
[06:54.600 --> 06:59.440]  weeks, but we are in the midst of nationwide cannabis legalization.
[06:59.440 --> 07:04.520]  It started several years ago in California, then it slowly crept through other states.
[07:04.520 --> 07:10.200]  Then once California, Colorado, and Washington all had major cannabis laws in place and it
[07:10.240 --> 07:12.640]  was working, that's when shit started flowing.
[07:12.640 --> 07:19.400]  And now I think we have got more states with positive cannabis laws than we do states with
[07:19.400 --> 07:20.960]  complete prohibition.
[07:20.960 --> 07:28.440]  So you are witnessing the sweep, the shift, the transition of cannabis legalization nationwide
[07:28.440 --> 07:29.440]  in America.
[07:29.440 --> 07:31.040]  You are getting to see that.
[07:31.040 --> 07:36.600]  Also, if you are witnessing and you are part of this coronavirus, you are seeing something
[07:36.600 --> 07:38.420]  that we have never seen before.
[07:38.420 --> 07:43.740]  We have seen many weird tragedies and weird things and events unfold in the states and
[07:43.740 --> 07:47.380]  in the world, but we've never seen anything like this.
[07:47.380 --> 07:48.500]  So it may seem weird.
[07:48.500 --> 07:49.500]  It may seem uncomfortable.
[07:49.500 --> 07:51.260]  It may seem scary.
[07:51.260 --> 07:53.340]  It may just seem like a big joke to you.
[07:53.340 --> 07:59.260]  Whatever it seems like, pay some attention because this is a major historical monumental
[07:59.260 --> 08:00.260]  time.
[08:00.260 --> 08:02.980]  We are going to be talking about this for a hundred years.
[08:02.980 --> 08:06.820]  We're going to be talking about this to our grandchildren and their children.
[08:06.820 --> 08:08.020]  So pay attention.
[08:08.020 --> 08:09.020]  Take some notes.
[08:09.020 --> 08:13.180]  Just be aware of what's going on around you because this is a crazy time.
[08:13.180 --> 08:18.140]  Now I know I keep saying this, but in these crazy times, the most important thing to do
[08:18.140 --> 08:21.220]  is to be good to one another and look after each other.
[08:21.220 --> 08:24.340]  We can't get through these crazy times on our own.
[08:24.340 --> 08:29.500]  Some crazy fucking people will get through on their own, but most of us need each other.
[08:29.500 --> 08:31.780]  Most of us don't want to get by on our own.
[08:31.780 --> 08:35.580]  Most of us would rather put a hand out and help somebody and have somebody stick their
[08:35.580 --> 08:37.780]  hand out and help us in return.
[08:37.820 --> 08:39.220]  That's the way it should work.
[08:39.220 --> 08:41.840]  So be kind to everybody right now.
[08:41.840 --> 08:46.460]  Have a little bit of extra patience with everybody around you and remember that everybody is
[08:46.460 --> 08:51.500]  dealing with this weird situation and we are all going to deal with it in our own weird
[08:51.500 --> 08:52.500]  way.
[08:52.500 --> 08:54.700]  We don't all respond to situations similarly.
[08:54.700 --> 08:56.940]  That should be obvious by social media.
[08:56.940 --> 08:58.900]  Some people are completely freaking out.
[08:58.900 --> 09:02.020]  Some people don't give a shit and some people are right there in the middle.
[09:02.020 --> 09:06.660]  However you are choosing to deal with these weird times, with this weird situation, keep
[09:06.660 --> 09:09.300]  in mind that we are all dealing with weird shit as well.
[09:09.300 --> 09:10.940]  We are all uncomfortable.
[09:10.940 --> 09:13.220]  We are all adjusting our lives and schedules.
[09:13.220 --> 09:14.540]  We've all been cooped up.
[09:14.540 --> 09:15.960]  We all want to make sure we eat.
[09:15.960 --> 09:17.900]  We all want to make sure that our families survive.
[09:17.900 --> 09:19.460]  We all want to stay healthy.
[09:19.460 --> 09:21.060]  You're not the only one.
[09:21.060 --> 09:25.540]  Let's do our part together to keep an eye on each other and keep each other safe and
[09:25.540 --> 09:30.940]  happy and healthy and let's just be kind to one another in any and every way that we can,
[09:30.940 --> 09:31.940]  you guys.
[09:31.940 --> 09:35.300]  I'm sure that most of my audience, most of my friends, most of the Iry Army and the Grow
[09:35.460 --> 09:39.580]  Your Heart crew doesn't need to hear that, but it's just a simple reminder.
[09:39.580 --> 09:42.280]  Sometimes in weird times, we forget the basic shit.
[09:42.280 --> 09:47.940]  The most important basic shit is to love one another and be kind to each other and we will
[09:47.940 --> 09:48.940]  get through this.
[09:48.940 --> 09:49.940]  All right, you guys.
[09:49.940 --> 09:55.420]  I feel like I'm fucking super ranty and super preachy, but I also feel like if it's my responsibility
[09:55.420 --> 10:00.820]  to provide content and keep people entertained, I've also got to speak the positive message.
[10:00.820 --> 10:01.820]  So there you go.
[10:01.820 --> 10:02.820]  That's the message.
[10:02.820 --> 10:03.980]  We can fucking do this.
[10:03.980 --> 10:05.180]  We're going to be just fine.
[10:05.260 --> 10:06.260]  Take care of everybody.
[10:06.260 --> 10:10.180]  Now, let's focus on a cannabis-based podcast.
[10:10.180 --> 10:15.580]  This is the part of the show where I start reading emails sent in from our listeners.
[10:15.580 --> 10:19.580]  If you've got a cannabis culture or a cannabis cultivation question, I would love to hear
[10:19.580 --> 10:20.580]  from you.
[10:20.580 --> 10:24.140]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[10:24.140 --> 10:29.460]  The first email for today's episode goes just like this.
[10:29.460 --> 10:30.460]  What up, Rasta Jeff?
[10:30.460 --> 10:33.660]  If this makes it to your show, feel free to throw my name out there.
[10:33.660 --> 10:34.940]  Hey, I recognize your name.
[10:34.980 --> 10:36.740]  I think I've said your name on the show.
[10:36.740 --> 10:38.540]  Big shout out to our friend Thor.
[10:38.540 --> 10:40.340]  He is back with another question.
[10:40.340 --> 10:42.420]  It says, I got a few head scratchers.
[10:42.420 --> 10:45.420]  I want to run by you and see what you think.
[10:45.420 --> 10:50.860]  It starts off with, my little brother has ADHD really badly, which he takes Adderall
[10:50.860 --> 10:51.860]  for.
[10:51.860 --> 10:53.840]  He's been on Adderall pretty much his whole life.
[10:53.840 --> 10:56.420]  It makes him very irritable and a zombie.
[10:56.420 --> 11:00.920]  So I'm in the works of trying to get my mom to try him on CBD.
[11:00.920 --> 11:06.640]  My question for you is, if I was to run a CBD plant in the same tent with my other babies,
[11:06.640 --> 11:08.280]  would it hurt anything?
[11:08.280 --> 11:12.680]  I've been holding onto these CBD seeds for a while now because I'm scared the CBD will
[11:12.680 --> 11:16.800]  affect my THC content on my other plants.
[11:16.800 --> 11:18.040]  That's a very good question.
[11:18.040 --> 11:22.320]  And you were honestly not the first person to ask that question.
[11:22.320 --> 11:25.000]  I'm going to kind of clear up the question for other listeners.
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.640]  Our friend Thor here has a garden with normal cannabis plants where he is growing to achieve
[11:30.720 --> 11:32.720]  high THC potency.
[11:32.720 --> 11:35.840]  He wants that THC buzz in most of his garden.
[11:35.840 --> 11:40.720]  Unfortunately, he's got a family member who is on medication that makes them a zombie
[11:40.720 --> 11:44.040]  and he's trying to offer CBD as an alternative.
[11:44.040 --> 11:50.800]  He wants to take it upon himself to grow that CBD in his grow tent with his THC rich plants.
[11:50.800 --> 11:58.000]  He is concerned that that CBD plant may somehow disrupt or contaminate his THC garden.
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.500]  Have no fear, my friend, because nothing bad will happen to your THC crop.
[12:03.500 --> 12:08.640]  You will be able to grow your THC plants right alongside your CBD plants and everything will
[12:08.640 --> 12:10.420]  be perfectly happy.
[12:10.420 --> 12:11.800]  Nothing will go wrong.
[12:11.800 --> 12:18.480]  You are basically growing a different phenotype of the same type of plant next to other plants.
[12:18.480 --> 12:22.520]  So if you've got, I'm just going to make up strains, if you've got Arise and you've got
[12:22.520 --> 12:27.580]  Golden Goat and you've got OG Kush in one room, when you add whichever CBD varietal
[12:27.660 --> 12:31.700]  you're going to put in there, it's going to think you just put in another OG Kush or another
[12:31.700 --> 12:34.080]  Golden Goat or another Arise.
[12:34.080 --> 12:36.960]  It's basically just like putting another cannabis plant in there.
[12:36.960 --> 12:41.960]  The main difference is that that plant has bred to express different cannabinoids.
[12:41.960 --> 12:45.900]  The plants you were familiar with growing, if I bred them, if other breeders bred them,
[12:45.900 --> 12:49.580]  we probably bred them to be rich in THC.
[12:49.580 --> 12:54.820]  Those plants that are rich in CBD are the same plants, just bred for a different goal.
[12:54.820 --> 12:59.520]  They bred, they found plants with CBD in there, then they isolated those and bred to those
[12:59.520 --> 13:04.620]  again and repeated the process until they stabilized that CBD dominant trait.
[13:04.620 --> 13:06.500]  So it is the same type of a plant.
[13:06.500 --> 13:08.000]  It will grow similarly.
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.660]  It may have different characteristics.
[13:09.660 --> 13:14.160]  It may want slightly different things because it is phenotypically different, but it will
[13:14.160 --> 13:19.140]  not have any adverse effects to your THC plants.
[13:19.140 --> 13:22.700]  A really simple way to think about this is if you've got a farm full of chickens and
[13:22.700 --> 13:26.540]  you put a turkey on the farm, do your chickens turn into turkeys?
[13:26.540 --> 13:28.680]  Everybody just stays exactly what they are.
[13:28.680 --> 13:32.700]  Your cannabis plants are going to continue to produce that THC rich bud.
[13:32.700 --> 13:36.820]  Your CBD plants will begin to produce that CBD rich bud.
[13:36.820 --> 13:40.580]  Everything will go just as nature intended and I think you'll be a happy camper.
[13:40.580 --> 13:45.940]  And I really hope that the CBD medicine works well for your brother so we can help out with
[13:45.940 --> 13:50.140]  that ADHD and maybe kind of, we can't take away the Adderall right away.
[13:50.140 --> 13:54.780]  I'm not a doctor, but maybe we can minimize that, get a little personality back into them,
[13:54.780 --> 13:56.620]  make them a fun little brother again.
[13:56.620 --> 13:57.620]  Hopefully that works for you.
[13:57.620 --> 13:58.620]  All right.
[13:58.620 --> 14:00.020]  So that is the first half of the question.
[14:00.020 --> 14:04.500]  You can totally put your CBD rich plants in with your THC plants.
[14:04.500 --> 14:05.660]  Nothing will happen.
[14:05.660 --> 14:06.860]  Nothing bad will happen.
[14:06.860 --> 14:11.420]  If you grow properly, you will have two marvelous types of medicine that work for your brother
[14:11.420 --> 14:12.680]  and yourself.
[14:12.680 --> 14:16.260]  Like I said before, if you put a goose in the chicken pen or if you put a turkey in
[14:16.260 --> 14:19.580]  the cow pen, we don't get different types of animals.
[14:20.020 --> 14:21.020]  It basically stays the same.
[14:21.020 --> 14:24.220]  To the best of my knowledge, plants will work just the same.
[14:24.220 --> 14:29.020]  You're definitely not going to disrupt the THC production or the CBD production.
[14:29.020 --> 14:30.980]  There is another half to this question.
[14:30.980 --> 14:33.380]  I'm super rambly because of that dab.
[14:33.380 --> 14:34.380]  Let's keep going.
[14:34.380 --> 14:37.100]  It says, my other question is about nutrients.
[14:37.100 --> 14:42.600]  I'm currently trying the advanced nutrients three part grow micro and bloom on the label.
[14:42.600 --> 14:45.880]  They advertise that their product is pH perfect.
[14:45.880 --> 14:50.000]  I still check my pH when I water because I'm not sure if it is safe to trust.
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.160]  Do you have any experience with advanced nutrients and pH perfect products?
[14:55.160 --> 14:59.600]  Yes, I do have some experience and some input and some feedback.
[14:59.600 --> 15:04.760]  When I first started taking growing seriously and was really trying to up my production,
[15:04.760 --> 15:10.120]  I was sold by the advanced nutrients pitch of you will get 30% more product just by using
[15:10.120 --> 15:11.520]  all of our bottles.
[15:11.520 --> 15:13.920]  I really thought that that would work well for me.
[15:13.960 --> 15:17.240]  I did achieve that 30% that they talk about.
[15:17.240 --> 15:20.120]  I noticed that my yields and my harvest were bigger.
[15:20.120 --> 15:24.920]  The thing I did not like about advanced nutrients, and this is just my opinion, I have no hatred
[15:24.920 --> 15:25.920]  for anybody.
[15:25.920 --> 15:27.360]  This was just my experience.
[15:27.360 --> 15:31.040]  I ran multiple different strains in the same room.
[15:31.040 --> 15:32.440]  I had cherry widow in there.
[15:32.440 --> 15:33.960]  I had blueberry in there.
[15:33.960 --> 15:35.560]  I had white rhino in that room.
[15:35.560 --> 15:38.920]  I had several different varietals in that room.
[15:38.920 --> 15:45.280]  When I grew them using advanced nutrients, bottled nutrients, most of my flowers looked
[15:45.280 --> 15:47.800]  and smelled the same once they were harvested.
[15:47.800 --> 15:51.000]  There was not a big variation in my products.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  I carefully selected my strains.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.200]  I had that cherry widow because it's cherry.
[15:55.200 --> 15:57.960]  It's got that really funky cherry flavor.
[15:57.960 --> 16:01.680]  I had blueberry because it's got a very distinct blueberry flavor.
[16:01.680 --> 16:05.840]  I had white rhino because it would make giant buds that were covered in resin and had this
[16:05.840 --> 16:08.160]  really sweet flavor to it.
[16:08.160 --> 16:11.160]  In the end of the grow, it all looked like white rhino.
[16:11.160 --> 16:12.520]  It all looked like cherry widow.
[16:12.520 --> 16:15.400]  You couldn't tell the buds apart if you put them in a bag.
[16:15.400 --> 16:16.560]  I really blame that.
[16:16.560 --> 16:20.680]  I really attribute that to the advanced nutrients product line.
[16:20.680 --> 16:22.320]  I don't know exactly what does it.
[16:22.320 --> 16:24.360]  I have my assumptions and my theories.
[16:24.360 --> 16:25.400]  I cannot prove that.
[16:25.400 --> 16:29.280]  I'm not going to say it because I have no science to back it up, but I really think
[16:29.280 --> 16:35.640]  those nutrients made all of my flowers, all of my buds look, smell, and taste exactly
[16:35.640 --> 16:36.640]  the same.
[16:36.840 --> 16:39.320]  Now let's talk about the pH perfect part.
[16:39.320 --> 16:44.240]  I don't know the science behind it, but if you mix their nutrients in the proper ratios,
[16:44.240 --> 16:48.240]  they will come out pH perfect at 6.5.
[16:48.240 --> 16:52.720]  If 6.5 is your goal, that is a beautiful process that does save you a step.
[16:52.720 --> 16:57.220]  I would, however, check every time I mix my nutrients.
[16:57.220 --> 17:02.440]  If it is off, that may indicate that you skipped a bottle or perhaps doubled up on a bottle.
[17:02.440 --> 17:09.880]  But in my experience, those solutions did mix up to pH perfect at 6.5 if I used the
[17:09.880 --> 17:14.920]  appropriate amounts of each product and if I mixed it appropriately.
[17:14.920 --> 17:19.200]  So the claim of pH perfect does hold up in my experience.
[17:19.200 --> 17:23.640]  The claim of 30% more product does hold up in my experience.
[17:23.640 --> 17:29.160]  The only downside I noticed from using that line of products was that most of my flowers
[17:29.160 --> 17:32.760]  looked, smelled, and tasted exactly the same.
[17:32.760 --> 17:36.640]  So instead of growing multiple strains, I should have just ran a whole bunch of one
[17:36.640 --> 17:39.320]  strain to make the entire room uniform.
[17:39.320 --> 17:41.720]  But nobody wants a whole bunch of one product.
[17:41.720 --> 17:46.880]  You would like variety, at least in my circle, in my area, people demand variety.
[17:46.880 --> 17:48.800]  So that's the way I had to do it.
[17:48.800 --> 17:54.360]  So the pH did work for me, but again, I recommend that you do check your pH every time you mix
[17:54.360 --> 17:55.720]  just to be safe.
[17:55.720 --> 17:57.440]  I can tell you if you messed up in your mix.
[17:57.440 --> 18:01.080]  I can tell you if you overfed something, if you underfed something.
[18:01.080 --> 18:04.380]  Also it's a good way to make sure that that pH pin is working.
[18:04.380 --> 18:07.840]  If something is off, calibrate the pin, then check the solution again.
[18:07.840 --> 18:10.800]  Then you know if your pin or your solution is off.
[18:10.800 --> 18:12.720]  You guys make sure you calibrate your equipment.
[18:12.720 --> 18:14.840]  I know I just went on a way side road.
[18:14.840 --> 18:16.920]  We're going to get lost on this side street for a minute.
[18:16.920 --> 18:17.960]  Come have fun with me.
[18:17.960 --> 18:19.920]  It's always fun on the side roads.
[18:19.920 --> 18:24.840]  Make it a habit to routinely calibrate your pH meters.
[18:24.840 --> 18:28.400]  Make it a habit to routinely clean your pH meter.
[18:28.400 --> 18:32.120]  Make it a habit to routinely clean your EC meters.
[18:32.120 --> 18:35.360]  Clean and calibrate all of your tools and equipment.
[18:35.360 --> 18:38.880]  Also if you've got anything with a filter in it, if you've got an air conditioner with
[18:38.880 --> 18:42.860]  a filter, clean that filter on a regular basis.
[18:42.860 --> 18:47.440]  Every month or every two weeks should be your standard cleaning schedule.
[18:47.440 --> 18:51.400]  Get in there at least once a month and clean the shit out of everything that needs to be
[18:51.400 --> 18:52.760]  cleaned.
[18:52.920 --> 18:59.400]  Also, every harvest, do a thorough deep cleaning before you refill the room with plants.
[18:59.400 --> 19:03.880]  If you're running a perpetual grow, there is one area of that grow that is a fucking
[19:03.880 --> 19:04.880]  mess.
[19:04.880 --> 19:08.600]  Take a minute to clean it up before you put the next batch of plants in there.
[19:08.600 --> 19:12.480]  When it comes to gardening, cleanliness is next to godliness.
[19:12.480 --> 19:13.480]  Clean that shit up.
[19:13.480 --> 19:15.000]  You're playing God in there.
[19:15.000 --> 19:16.000]  Keep it clean.
[19:16.000 --> 19:17.760]  So that's my side rent, you guys.
[19:17.760 --> 19:18.960]  Calibrate your equipment.
[19:18.960 --> 19:20.200]  Clean all your equipment.
[19:20.200 --> 19:22.880]  Keep everything nice and tidy and nice and organized.
[19:22.880 --> 19:27.000]  A nice clean workspace makes everything flow so much more smoothly.
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.280]  It helps you keep your tools, your equipment, and your thoughts and your plans and your
[19:31.280 --> 19:33.120]  goals more organized.
[19:33.120 --> 19:37.600]  So calibrate your shit, clean your filters, and just clean up and organize your grow space.
[19:37.600 --> 19:39.320]  It only takes a few minutes.
[19:39.320 --> 19:42.320]  And if you really clean up, it'll save you time in the future.
[19:42.320 --> 19:44.280]  You won't wonder where your scissors are.
[19:44.280 --> 19:45.280]  They're right there.
[19:45.280 --> 19:47.300]  You won't wonder where your pH pen is.
[19:47.300 --> 19:48.300]  It's right there.
[19:48.300 --> 19:49.480]  Right where it should be.
[19:49.480 --> 19:50.480]  Clean up after yourself.
[19:50.480 --> 19:52.760]  It will save you so much time in the future.
[19:52.760 --> 19:57.560]  And that scrambly feeling in your brain will minimize and you can focus more on the task
[19:57.560 --> 19:58.560]  at hand.
[19:58.560 --> 20:00.280]  I need to get myself back on track.
[20:00.280 --> 20:03.200]  Speaking of task at hand, there is more to this email.
[20:03.200 --> 20:06.520]  It says, where can I find some Lemon Jeffrey genetics?
[20:06.520 --> 20:11.760]  And of course, the answer to that is seedsherenow.com.
[20:11.760 --> 20:16.480]  Make sure you use coupon code GFYH10 at checkout and you will save 10%.
[20:17.480 --> 20:21.680]  All righty, wraps up the message with, your podcast has easily become my favorite podcast,
[20:21.680 --> 20:23.920]  which I listen to every day.
[20:23.920 --> 20:27.560]  Also not to mention it has educated me so much as a grower.
[20:27.560 --> 20:31.160]  So thank you for all of your information and hard work.
[20:31.160 --> 20:33.600]  Man, that's a great way to wrap up an email.
[20:33.600 --> 20:35.680]  I'm glad that I'm your favorite podcast.
[20:35.680 --> 20:37.640]  I'm glad you're listening every day.
[20:37.640 --> 20:39.040]  I'm glad you're getting educated.
[20:39.040 --> 20:44.000]  Man, I'm glad you're becoming a better grower because of the time I spend talking into a
[20:44.000 --> 20:45.000]  microphone.
[20:45.000 --> 20:46.080]  That means a lot to me.
[20:46.200 --> 20:48.200]  People are getting better at their craft.
[20:48.200 --> 20:49.880]  They're getting better at their passion.
[20:49.880 --> 20:51.760]  They're getting more passionate about it.
[20:51.760 --> 20:55.000]  And also they're making a better product with that passion.
[20:55.000 --> 20:56.440]  So that means a lot to me.
[20:56.440 --> 20:57.440]  Thank you.
[20:57.440 --> 20:58.440]  That is a huge compliment.
[20:58.440 --> 21:00.280]  You're welcome for all of the information.
[21:00.280 --> 21:02.800]  I feel like I've been given a serious gift.
[21:02.800 --> 21:04.320]  I've got a lot of gifts.
[21:04.320 --> 21:10.000]  The gift to absorb information and learn so quickly, and then also to have been in the
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.760]  place where cannabis was legalized, where I had all these opportunities.
[21:14.800 --> 21:18.200]  I know that those two things were major gifts that lined up.
[21:18.200 --> 21:24.400]  Then also to have this personality, this gift of gab, this inability to shut the fuck up,
[21:24.400 --> 21:27.960]  this constant need to be talking and teaching and sharing ideas.
[21:27.960 --> 21:29.480]  I think that that is a gift.
[21:29.480 --> 21:31.280]  Sometimes it's a curse, don't get me wrong.
[21:31.280 --> 21:34.320]  But I think I have harnessed it and turned it into a gift.
[21:34.320 --> 21:39.360]  The gift of being able to learn something, and then also the gift of being here in Colorado
[21:39.360 --> 21:41.040]  where cannabis was legalized.
[21:41.040 --> 21:44.520]  And then this other gift of being able to share my ideas articulately.
[21:45.280 --> 21:49.960]  I think that that was something that was given to me that I am supposed to use in this exact
[21:49.960 --> 21:50.960]  manner.
[21:50.960 --> 21:53.320]  If I didn't do this, I think something would go wrong.
[21:53.320 --> 21:54.320]  I would just explode.
[21:54.320 --> 21:56.560]  I may spontaneously combust.
[21:56.560 --> 22:01.120]  Nothing in my world would be right if I didn't share this information and this knowledge.
[22:01.120 --> 22:05.560]  I feel like whatever you believe in, if it's God, if it's Jesus, if it's the sun, if you
[22:05.560 --> 22:09.320]  believe in bacon, whatever you believe in, I'm going to go with yours because it's much
[22:09.320 --> 22:10.320]  easier.
[22:10.320 --> 22:14.120]  Whatever you believe in, that deity, that creation gave me this gift.
[22:14.120 --> 22:19.200]  If I didn't use it, it would almost be disrespectful to bacon or the sun or whoever you believe
[22:19.200 --> 22:20.200]  in.
[22:20.200 --> 22:21.200]  I'm cool with whatever you believe in.
[22:21.200 --> 22:22.200]  I'm pretty open-minded.
[22:22.200 --> 22:24.960]  You know what I'm down with, but it's much more friendly if I just let you have yours
[22:24.960 --> 22:25.960]  for a moment.
[22:25.960 --> 22:30.840]  So whatever you believe in gave me this ability, and it would be disrespectful and selfish
[22:30.840 --> 22:32.760]  to bottle it up and not put that out.
[22:32.760 --> 22:36.080]  So thank you for noticing, and thank you for listening.
[22:36.080 --> 22:37.320]  Thank you for the great email.
[22:37.320 --> 22:41.920]  He wraps up the message with, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me, bruh, from
[22:41.920 --> 22:42.920]  Thor.
[22:43.160 --> 22:48.120]  Hey Thor, I am going to take a gigantic dab as soon as I wrap up this podcast, and I promise
[22:48.120 --> 22:52.040]  you that the next time I see my mama, I will give her a big old hug, and then I'm going
[22:52.040 --> 22:55.880]  to tell her, that was from my buddy Thor, and she's going to be really confused, but
[22:55.880 --> 22:57.280]  that's okay.
[22:57.280 --> 22:59.000]  Thank you for the great message, bro.
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.600]  If anybody else out there has a cannabis cultivation or a cannabis culture question, you can send

[23:14.840 --> 23:18.560]  and growers, all you bad motherfuckers out there, I want to thank you again for listening

[24:17.400 --> 24:23.250]  I'm the man from the mountain.
[24:23.250 --> 24:26.250]  Won't you come on up?
[24:32.050 --> 24:37.050]  I'm a man in the valley with a face full of mud.
[24:37.890 --> 24:45.290]  Yes, I am stumbling and I know my car won't start.
[24:45.290 --> 24:51.290]  Yes, I am fumbling and I know I play a bad guitar.
[24:52.290 --> 24:57.290]  Give me a little drink from your loving cup.
[24:58.290 --> 25:08.540]  Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk.
[25:09.380 --> 25:14.380]  I'm the man who walks the hillside in the sweet summer sun.
[25:19.770 --> 25:25.770]  I'm the man who brings you roses when you ain't got none.
[25:27.770 --> 25:32.770]  Yes, I can run and jump and fish, but I won't fight.
[25:33.770 --> 25:38.770]  Do if you want to push and pull with me all night.
[25:39.610 --> 25:44.610]  Give me a little drink from your loving cup.
[25:45.610 --> 25:52.610]  Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk.
[25:55.610 --> 25:59.610]  I feel so humble with you tonight.
[25:59.610 --> 26:04.610]  Just sitting in front of the fire.
[26:05.450 --> 26:08.450]  I see your face dancing in the flame.
[26:08.450 --> 26:11.450]  I feel your mouth kissing me again.
[26:11.450 --> 26:13.450]  What a beautiful buzz.
[26:13.450 --> 26:15.450]  What a beautiful buzz.
[26:15.450 --> 26:17.450]  What a beautiful buzz.
[26:17.450 --> 26:19.450]  What a beautiful buzz.
[26:19.450 --> 26:28.100]  What a beautiful buzz.
[26:28.100 --> 26:30.100]  What a beautiful buzz.
[26:31.100 --> 26:38.900]  I am gritty and my shirts are torn.
[26:39.740 --> 26:44.740]  All I want is love to fill the beans with you till dawn.
[26:45.740 --> 26:50.740]  Give me a little drink from your loving cup.
[26:51.740 --> 27:00.080]  Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk.
[28:18.820 --> 28:23.660]  I feel so humble with you tonight.
