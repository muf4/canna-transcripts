[00:17.850 --> 00:20.250]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:20.250 --> 00:22.090]  It's time for episode number 161
[00:22.090 --> 00:23.850]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.850 --> 00:27.450]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.450 --> 00:28.530]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.530 --> 00:29.730]  if you're a barefoot grower,
[00:29.730 --> 00:32.050]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:32.050 --> 00:33.730]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:33.730 --> 00:36.130]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.130 --> 00:38.450]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.610 --> 00:41.250]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.250 --> 00:43.050]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.050 --> 00:44.850]  As always, I'm gonna send a huge thank you shout out
[00:44.850 --> 00:46.410]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band
[00:46.410 --> 00:48.690]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.690 --> 00:50.250]  Big shout out to Kat, Kud,
[00:50.250 --> 00:52.970]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:52.970 --> 00:55.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday evening
[00:55.090 --> 00:58.250]  in Pueblo, Colorado, and it is hot as shit for some reason.
[00:58.250 --> 00:59.970]  Why is it so warm, dude?
[00:59.970 --> 01:01.050]  Global warming.
[01:01.050 --> 01:02.850]  Global warming, you blame that's perfect.
[01:02.850 --> 01:03.970]  I agree with you.
[01:03.970 --> 01:05.170]  It's almost 710.
[01:05.170 --> 01:06.610]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast.
[01:06.610 --> 01:08.650]  Across the table from me is a repeat offender.
[01:08.650 --> 01:09.970]  I don't know if you caught that in the intro.
[01:09.970 --> 01:11.210]  I did say barefoot grower.
[01:11.210 --> 01:14.210]  My buddy, Will, the barefoot grower is back on the podcast.
[01:14.210 --> 01:15.090]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[01:15.090 --> 01:16.010]  Hey, thanks for having me, man.
[01:16.770 --> 01:17.610]  Good to be back.
[01:17.610 --> 01:18.450]  Dude, thanks for coming.
[01:18.450 --> 01:19.290]  My lips are all sticky
[01:19.290 --> 01:20.210]  because we just took some super delicious dabs
[01:20.210 --> 01:22.290]  and the dab rig that I've got from Elevate
[01:22.290 --> 01:23.970]  has that mouthpiece that makes your mouth
[01:23.970 --> 01:25.330]  kind of do the kissy face,
[01:25.330 --> 01:28.450]  and it made my lips all sticky, so my words are going.
[01:28.450 --> 01:29.330]  It's pretty funny over here
[01:29.330 --> 01:30.850]  if you're seeing me trying to struggle and talk.
[01:30.850 --> 01:35.210]  I got the sticky dab wax in my mustache, dab residue.
[01:35.210 --> 01:36.450]  Back in the day, I'm ranting now,
[01:36.450 --> 01:39.450]  but back in the day, I used to go to the clinic in Denver
[01:39.450 --> 01:42.210]  and they sold this Durban Poison wax
[01:42.210 --> 01:43.410]  and it had the best high.
[01:43.410 --> 01:44.250]  I loved it.
[01:44.290 --> 01:46.450]  I knew you would smoke it if you put your teeth together,
[01:46.450 --> 01:48.690]  they would stick together a little bit.
[01:48.690 --> 01:49.890]  For some reason, I loved it.
[01:49.890 --> 01:51.690]  I would just sit there and just stick my teeth together
[01:51.690 --> 01:53.730]  and pull them apart, tink, tink, tink, tink,
[01:53.730 --> 01:54.570]  and just do it over and over and over.
[01:54.570 --> 01:55.690]  I kind of know what you're talking about.
[01:55.690 --> 01:56.530]  I know what that feeling is.
[01:56.530 --> 01:59.050]  Yeah, it was almost like you took a bite of a crayon,
[01:59.050 --> 02:02.210]  kind of, but for some reason, I loved the texture.
[02:02.210 --> 02:04.010]  The way I, I'm weird, sorry.
[02:04.010 --> 02:04.850]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[02:04.850 --> 02:06.570]  I will quit ranting.
[02:06.570 --> 02:08.610]  Let's see, do I gotta give anybody a shout out?
[02:08.610 --> 02:10.490]  Let's see, shout out to our friends at Elevate Glass
[02:10.490 --> 02:13.650]  because I've been hitting this orange pumpkin rig
[02:14.010 --> 02:14.850]  like a boss.
[02:14.850 --> 02:15.810]  That banger is filthy.
[02:15.810 --> 02:17.130]  The rig needs a bath.
[02:17.130 --> 02:20.330]  Thanks again, you guys, for the dope rig.
[02:20.330 --> 02:22.290]  So, well, welcome to the show.
[02:22.290 --> 02:23.450]  We've got a bunch of notes.
[02:23.450 --> 02:24.690]  Are you still blowing glass, dude,
[02:24.690 --> 02:25.530]  or has that kind of been?
[02:25.530 --> 02:28.210]  No, that's just kind of put on.
[02:28.210 --> 02:30.610]  I'm hoping to maybe one day get back into it.
[02:30.610 --> 02:31.450]  Do you miss it?
[02:31.450 --> 02:32.290]  I do miss it every now and then, especially.
[02:32.290 --> 02:33.610]  I can see that you got a huge smile
[02:33.610 --> 02:34.810]  when we started talking about it.
[02:34.810 --> 02:35.650]  Yeah, whenever I go,
[02:35.650 --> 02:36.890]  because I have some friends that still do it,
[02:36.890 --> 02:38.730]  and if I go to their house or whatever
[02:38.730 --> 02:40.370]  and I get into the studio,
[02:40.370 --> 02:42.330]  it kind of like, I don't know, I miss it for sure.
[02:42.370 --> 02:44.010]  Yeah, you don't start, your fingers start spinning?
[02:44.010 --> 02:44.970]  Yeah, I'm always just like, man,
[02:44.970 --> 02:46.730]  I want to kind of ask them if I can hop behind a torch,
[02:46.730 --> 02:47.730]  but they're not blowing glass,
[02:47.730 --> 02:49.610]  so I don't want to intrude.
[02:49.610 --> 02:50.890]  That gas is so expensive.
[02:50.890 --> 02:52.730]  Exactly, and I know that too.
[02:52.730 --> 02:53.570]  And glass is expensive too.
[02:53.570 --> 02:56.170]  Do you think you still got the spin technique mastered?
[02:56.170 --> 02:58.930]  I like to think I do, but I don't know
[02:58.930 --> 03:00.170]  if it's like riding a bike or not.
[03:00.170 --> 03:01.290]  I'd have to kind of figure it out,
[03:01.290 --> 03:02.850]  because I mean, I would take a couple days off
[03:02.850 --> 03:05.610]  and I'd notice a difference back in the day.
[03:05.610 --> 03:08.330]  I've got these big, fumbly, wookie hands.
[03:08.330 --> 03:09.170]  I can't.
[03:09.170 --> 03:10.370]  So when you're blowing glass, you guys,
[03:10.490 --> 03:14.650]  I do not, I know very, very little about making glass,
[03:14.650 --> 03:16.610]  but when you're blowing glass, you got to turn it.
[03:16.610 --> 03:18.210]  You have to turn your right hand and your left hand
[03:18.210 --> 03:19.650]  at the same time, and you got to have the torch
[03:19.650 --> 03:21.730]  in the middle-ish or whatever section you're heating.
[03:21.730 --> 03:23.330]  And if one hand spins faster than the other,
[03:23.330 --> 03:24.850]  your shit starts twisting.
[03:24.850 --> 03:27.250]  And if one hand goes higher than the other,
[03:27.250 --> 03:28.650]  your piece starts bending,
[03:28.650 --> 03:32.410]  and there's a flame in front of you, and it's hot,
[03:32.410 --> 03:33.970]  and your muscles start twitching
[03:33.970 --> 03:35.170]  because you're doing the same thing.
[03:35.170 --> 03:36.290]  So it's kind of a pain in the ass.
[03:36.290 --> 03:39.970]  But so shout out to the people who do the twist.
[03:40.570 --> 03:42.770]  So man, your work was great.
[03:42.770 --> 03:43.930]  So I hope you get back into it.
[03:43.930 --> 03:44.770]  I appreciate you, man.
[03:44.770 --> 03:46.730]  Hopefully I'll be able to do it one day.
[03:46.730 --> 03:47.570]  I'm sure you will.
[03:47.570 --> 03:49.890]  Let's talk about your new venture now.
[03:49.890 --> 03:51.370]  One of the things that I wrote down
[03:51.370 --> 03:52.570]  that I wanted to make sure we cover
[03:52.570 --> 03:54.850]  is that you went from a basement grow
[03:54.850 --> 03:57.330]  to a large facility in a very short time.
[03:57.330 --> 03:59.690]  So how long, you're from North Carolina, right?
[03:59.690 --> 04:00.530]  Yes.
[04:00.530 --> 04:02.370]  Did you grow ganja in North Carolina?
[04:02.370 --> 04:03.810]  I did.
[04:03.810 --> 04:06.490]  I kind of like had did it for a few years there.
[04:06.490 --> 04:08.450]  Not successfully for the first year.
[04:08.450 --> 04:10.650]  Tried in Asheville and just failed miserably.
[04:10.650 --> 04:14.410]  It got into flower and then sprayed cow mag
[04:14.410 --> 04:16.090]  on the plants as a foliar one day.
[04:16.090 --> 04:18.610]  And totally just, I really don't know what I was thinking.
[04:18.610 --> 04:21.170]  It was one of those just had nobody to ask,
[04:21.170 --> 04:25.090]  no nothing to do, and thought that was how, I don't know.
[04:25.090 --> 04:26.090]  So killed those plants.
[04:26.090 --> 04:27.090]  You learned.
[04:27.090 --> 04:28.210]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:28.210 --> 04:30.370]  And then when I lived in Charlotte,
[04:30.370 --> 04:33.010]  I had an apartment and I got a tent
[04:33.010 --> 04:33.970]  and started growing in my closet.
[04:33.970 --> 04:35.930]  I actually got some genetics.
[04:35.930 --> 04:38.410]  So it was some Irie genetics.
[04:39.250 --> 04:40.090]  Back in the day.
[04:40.090 --> 04:41.210]  So this couldn't have been too long ago.
[04:41.210 --> 04:44.570]  No, it was about, let's see,
[04:44.570 --> 04:45.410]  I've been here for about a year and a half.
[04:45.410 --> 04:47.250]  So it would have been about two and a half years ago.
[04:47.250 --> 04:48.090]  Okay.
[04:48.090 --> 04:48.930]  Yeah.
[04:48.930 --> 04:49.770]  All right.
[04:49.770 --> 04:50.610]  That was going to be one of my next questions
[04:50.610 --> 04:51.450]  is how long you've been here.
[04:51.450 --> 04:52.850]  So you grew in Charlotte then?
[04:52.850 --> 04:53.690]  Yes.
[04:53.690 --> 04:54.530]  Successfully.
[04:54.530 --> 04:56.090]  Yes, I had a couple of harvests there in my closet.
[04:56.090 --> 04:57.210]  Which strain did you pull off?
[04:57.210 --> 04:58.050]  A heart of gold.
[04:58.050 --> 04:58.890]  Awesome.
[04:58.890 --> 04:59.730]  That's an easy one to grow too.
[04:59.730 --> 05:01.090]  I love that one.
[05:01.090 --> 05:01.930]  Nice.
[05:01.930 --> 05:02.770]  Yeah, that's a good one.
[05:02.770 --> 05:03.610]  It's a golden goat and grateful dog.
[05:03.610 --> 05:04.490]  It's a super good cross.
[05:04.490 --> 05:05.810]  So I have a place in my heart for golden goat
[05:05.850 --> 05:07.170]  because of that strain specifically.
[05:07.170 --> 05:08.010]  Nice.
[05:08.010 --> 05:08.850]  Yeah.
[05:08.850 --> 05:10.530]  I may have a golden goat clone in the future for you
[05:10.530 --> 05:11.370]  if you remind me.
[05:11.370 --> 05:12.410]  Yeah, I'm going to take clones of her
[05:12.410 --> 05:13.290]  in just a few nights here.
[05:13.290 --> 05:14.850]  So yeah, remind me of that.
[05:14.850 --> 05:17.250]  So you pulled off a couple of harvests there.
[05:17.250 --> 05:21.090]  Man, how sketchy is that growing in North Carolina?
[05:21.090 --> 05:22.610]  It's pretty sketchy.
[05:22.610 --> 05:24.130]  The way I was doing it, I mean, I didn't,
[05:24.130 --> 05:26.490]  I had a little CFL hood thing.
[05:26.490 --> 05:28.570]  It was like a really low key.
[05:28.570 --> 05:29.570]  Didn't put off a lot of heat.
[05:29.570 --> 05:31.810]  I had four little plants in my, in a little tent.
[05:31.810 --> 05:33.890]  It was like a two by four tent, I think.
[05:33.890 --> 05:34.890]  It was pretty small.
[05:35.850 --> 05:38.530]  But if I was doing like a basement grow or something,
[05:38.530 --> 05:39.650]  yeah, that'd be real sketchy.
[05:39.650 --> 05:40.490]  Okay.
[05:40.490 --> 05:41.970]  It's, I don't know.
[05:41.970 --> 05:43.370]  Yeah, people talk there too.
[05:43.370 --> 05:44.210]  Yeah.
[05:44.210 --> 05:45.050]  Yeah.
[05:45.050 --> 05:46.290]  I've met so many, everybody that I've met
[05:46.290 --> 05:49.170]  from North Carolina, like Spence, Maddie,
[05:49.170 --> 05:51.690]  Slop is kind of from North Carolina, Fong,
[05:51.690 --> 05:52.650]  all you folks.
[05:53.610 --> 05:55.770]  Was Tater from North Carolina?
[05:55.770 --> 05:56.610]  Is Tater?
[05:56.610 --> 05:57.450]  Yeah, I think so, yeah.
[05:57.450 --> 05:58.770]  Yeah, see all you folks that I met from North Carolina,
[05:58.770 --> 05:59.890]  I'm sure I missed a few people, guys.
[05:59.890 --> 06:00.730]  I'm sorry.
[06:00.730 --> 06:01.570]  There's so many of you.
[06:01.570 --> 06:02.410]  You guys are all awesome.
[06:02.410 --> 06:03.250]  Got Tans and Slater out here now.
[06:03.250 --> 06:04.090]  Danny.
[06:04.090 --> 06:04.930]  Yeah.
[06:05.170 --> 06:06.090]  Super great dudes.
[06:06.090 --> 06:07.010]  Like every one of you guys.
[06:07.010 --> 06:07.850]  Yeah.
[06:07.850 --> 06:09.610]  So yeah, super rad people from North Carolina.
[06:09.610 --> 06:11.530]  And I knew of other people from other outside of your crew
[06:11.530 --> 06:12.370]  that are just super awesome.
[06:12.370 --> 06:13.610]  But like your guys' whole town moved here.
[06:13.610 --> 06:14.450]  That was fun.
[06:14.450 --> 06:15.290]  Yeah, a lot of people moved here.
[06:15.290 --> 06:17.930]  There's a ghost town now with no cool people there.
[06:17.930 --> 06:19.170]  All the shitty people just stayed.
[06:19.170 --> 06:20.770]  All the cool people came right over here.
[06:20.770 --> 06:21.610]  Exactly.
[06:21.610 --> 06:23.330]  All right, so you've been here for about a year and a half.
[06:23.330 --> 06:28.290]  Yeah, since May of 2015, I guess.
[06:28.290 --> 06:29.130]  Yeah, 2015.
[06:29.130 --> 06:30.610]  How long did it take you to get a gross set up
[06:30.610 --> 06:31.450]  when you got here?
[06:31.450 --> 06:32.650]  It was like the first thing I did.
[06:32.650 --> 06:34.570]  I like, not even kidding, I got here
[06:35.210 --> 06:37.130]  and like day one, went out into the shed in the backyard,
[06:37.130 --> 06:38.970]  started gutting it out, took down all the shells,
[06:38.970 --> 06:40.090]  put up mylar.
[06:40.090 --> 06:41.570]  All the shit still in the U-Haul truck?
[06:41.570 --> 06:42.410]  You're like, we'll unload that in later.
[06:42.410 --> 06:43.850]  Exactly, I didn't even bring a U-Haul,
[06:43.850 --> 06:44.970]  I just packed my car up and drove out here.
[06:44.970 --> 06:46.410]  Nice, I love people that do that.
[06:46.410 --> 06:47.490]  Nice, I'm glad it worked out for you.
[06:47.490 --> 06:49.410]  A lot of people came out and weren't able to put it together
[06:49.410 --> 06:51.010]  so I'm glad you're motivated.
[06:51.010 --> 06:52.130]  Motivated potheads.
[06:52.130 --> 06:52.970]  Yes.
[06:52.970 --> 06:55.530]  All right, so how long did it take?
[06:55.530 --> 06:57.810]  So you blew glass for like about six or eight months,
[06:57.810 --> 06:58.650]  it seemed like.
[06:58.650 --> 06:59.490]  Yeah, about six, seven months.
[06:59.490 --> 07:00.570]  Okay, I was paying attention.
[07:00.570 --> 07:02.570]  And then you got into, how did,
[07:02.610 --> 07:04.570]  tell us where you're working now with the large facility.
[07:04.570 --> 07:06.570]  I am now at Ascend Cannabis Company.
[07:07.930 --> 07:09.770]  That's a cool name, I was gonna use that for a strain name
[07:09.770 --> 07:10.610]  when it became Arise.
[07:10.610 --> 07:12.250]  I remember that too when we were talking about that.
[07:12.250 --> 07:14.410]  But yeah, it's Ascend Cannabis Company,
[07:14.410 --> 07:16.570]  we have our dispensary up in Lakewood.
[07:17.490 --> 07:22.490]  Our grow greenhouse is here in Pueblo, it's really big.
[07:22.490 --> 07:23.890]  Huge facility, it's pretty sweet.
[07:23.890 --> 07:26.290]  Definitely a big step up from the basement.
[07:26.290 --> 07:27.490]  How many plants are you in charge of?
[07:27.490 --> 07:30.290]  I have 320 plants and flower at all times
[07:30.290 --> 07:31.130]  that I'm in charge of.
[07:31.450 --> 07:32.610]  What size pots?
[07:32.610 --> 07:33.450]  20 gallons.
[07:33.450 --> 07:34.890]  20 gallons, so those are huge plants,
[07:34.890 --> 07:36.130]  those aren't just little baby plants.
[07:36.130 --> 07:37.650]  They're pretty big plants.
[07:37.650 --> 07:40.570]  In the summer, it's not uncommon to see
[07:40.570 --> 07:42.010]  every plant hit a half pound.
[07:42.010 --> 07:43.130]  Wow.
[07:43.130 --> 07:45.810]  How often in the summer at peak harvest
[07:45.810 --> 07:47.170]  or at peak flowering,
[07:47.170 --> 07:49.290]  how often do those plants need to be watered?
[07:49.290 --> 07:50.890]  We water every other day.
[07:50.890 --> 07:53.090]  Sometimes the plants in the center of the greenhouse
[07:53.090 --> 07:55.530]  where they get more sun and more light every single day.
[07:55.530 --> 07:56.370]  Wow.
[07:56.370 --> 07:57.210]  In the middle of the summer, yeah,
[07:57.210 --> 07:58.030]  we had a couple of beds
[07:58.030 --> 07:58.870]  that we were hitting every single day this summer.
[07:58.870 --> 08:00.210]  Do you know how many gallons of water
[08:00.250 --> 08:02.250]  you're throwing in a 20 gallon pot?
[08:02.250 --> 08:04.490]  It's around two and a half gallons per, I believe.
[08:04.490 --> 08:05.330]  Oh, okay.
[08:05.330 --> 08:06.170]  I honestly expected more.
[08:06.170 --> 08:07.730]  Maybe I'm doing my math wrong,
[08:07.730 --> 08:12.730]  but we have 300 gallons for 120 plants every other day
[08:13.090 --> 08:15.730]  because our bed has 160 plants in it.
[08:15.730 --> 08:16.650]  It's two in a fraction.
[08:16.650 --> 08:17.490]  I'm not going to try to do math while I'm talking.
[08:17.490 --> 08:18.330]  Yeah, something like that, yeah, two and a half each.
[08:18.330 --> 08:20.570]  I'm reading notes and trying to look at you.
[08:20.570 --> 08:21.650]  I'm not going to do that much math.
[08:21.650 --> 08:25.770]  All right, so is that a good solid eight to 10 hours of work?
[08:25.770 --> 08:26.610]  Like every day?
[08:26.610 --> 08:27.430]  Yeah.
[08:27.430 --> 08:28.270]  Yeah, basically.
[08:28.270 --> 08:30.790]  We're there every single day from seven o'clock
[08:30.790 --> 08:33.710]  until on a good day, we got it four, 4.30.
[08:33.710 --> 08:34.550]  Nice.
[08:34.550 --> 08:35.370]  And that's every single day.
[08:35.370 --> 08:36.710]  Plus like a little bit of a drive
[08:36.710 --> 08:37.710]  because it's not right in town.
[08:37.710 --> 08:38.550]  Yeah, no, it's out in the county a little bit.
[08:38.550 --> 08:40.070]  Yeah, they put everything out in the,
[08:40.070 --> 08:41.390]  yeah, it's beautiful spots out there.
[08:41.390 --> 08:42.230]  Oh, I love it out there.
[08:42.230 --> 08:43.050]  I went for a drive.
[08:43.050 --> 08:44.750]  I took a friend of mine to go see the leaves change.
[08:44.750 --> 08:45.950]  Shout out to JB.
[08:45.950 --> 08:48.150]  I took her to go see the leaves change colors
[08:48.150 --> 08:50.310]  out by toward the castle and we went to the castle.
[08:50.310 --> 08:51.950]  Luckily we went before the fires.
[08:51.950 --> 08:52.790]  Oh my God.
[08:52.790 --> 08:53.610]  It's still raging.
[08:53.610 --> 08:54.450]  I can see it at work.
[08:54.450 --> 08:55.830]  Yeah, big, big shout out to all the people
[08:55.830 --> 08:56.950]  that have to deal with those fires.
[08:56.950 --> 08:57.790]  I feel so bad for you.
[08:57.790 --> 08:59.510]  My whole vibe just changed when I thought about it.
[08:59.510 --> 09:01.630]  But we went out there and there are,
[09:01.630 --> 09:02.670]  if you're paying attention,
[09:02.670 --> 09:04.750]  there are so many grows out there.
[09:04.750 --> 09:06.910]  There's a grow every five miles off to the left
[09:06.910 --> 09:08.430]  or the right side of the interstate.
[09:08.430 --> 09:10.310]  Some of them are super high tech and fancy.
[09:10.310 --> 09:11.990]  Some of them are a little jank,
[09:11.990 --> 09:13.870]  but there are so many grows out there
[09:13.870 --> 09:18.750]  from Pueblo to all the way into almost to the castle.
[09:18.750 --> 09:21.190]  There's a grow on highway 96 to the left
[09:21.190 --> 09:22.030]  or the right all the time.
[09:22.030 --> 09:23.750]  So you guys, if you've got to take your girlfriends
[09:23.750 --> 09:25.390]  out there or your significant other
[09:25.390 --> 09:26.950]  or your side chick or your boo,
[09:26.950 --> 09:28.310]  you got to take them out on a road trip
[09:28.310 --> 09:29.910]  to go look at the leaves in Colorado.
[09:29.910 --> 09:33.890]  Go drive up highway 96 between Pueblo and like Wetmore
[09:33.890 --> 09:36.350]  and then keep going even further up into Westcliff
[09:36.350 --> 09:38.990]  and look at all of the grows on the left
[09:38.990 --> 09:40.590]  and right side of the inter, on the highway
[09:40.590 --> 09:42.390]  while your girl's looking at all the leaves.
[09:42.390 --> 09:43.230]  It's amazing.
[09:43.230 --> 09:44.070]  You'll enjoy it.
[09:44.070 --> 09:45.310]  Definitely.
[09:45.310 --> 09:46.150]  All right.
[09:46.150 --> 09:47.150]  So one thing I wanted to talk about,
[09:47.150 --> 09:49.670]  you started off in a basement grow like most growers do.
[09:49.670 --> 09:51.790]  You start off in a tent like a lot of growers do.
[09:51.790 --> 09:53.270]  Graduated to a basement.
[09:53.270 --> 09:54.110]  I've seen your pictures.
[09:54.110 --> 09:54.930]  You crush it.
[09:55.470 --> 09:56.970]  You have a Kalanchee Kush that was gorgeous.
[09:56.970 --> 09:57.810]  I'm proud of that one.
[09:57.810 --> 09:59.210]  It's one of my favorites too.
[09:59.210 --> 10:00.050]  I love that.
[10:00.050 --> 10:01.450]  It's two of my favorite strains put together.
[10:01.450 --> 10:02.930]  It's Tahoe, G and Grateful Dogs.
[10:02.930 --> 10:04.570]  So you can't really go wrong right there.
[10:04.570 --> 10:05.410]  Shout out to Swerve.
[10:05.410 --> 10:06.690]  I got both those from Swerve.
[10:06.690 --> 10:08.970]  Where the hell was I going with this?
[10:08.970 --> 10:11.850]  Let's talk about some of the stuff that you learned
[10:11.850 --> 10:13.970]  that is different, that you had to adjust.
[10:13.970 --> 10:15.730]  Major differences you've noticed and learned
[10:15.730 --> 10:18.650]  going from like a small grow in your basement
[10:18.650 --> 10:20.250]  to this big gigantic facility.
[10:20.250 --> 10:21.130]  You said you had a greenhouse.
[10:21.130 --> 10:23.570]  Do you know how many square feet that greenhouse is?
[10:23.970 --> 10:24.810]  I've asked a couple people.
[10:24.810 --> 10:26.530]  No one seems to know for sure what it is.
[10:26.530 --> 10:29.930]  But we have two flower rooms.
[10:29.930 --> 10:32.990]  And in each flower room there is 640 plants
[10:32.990 --> 10:35.370]  and 20 gallons into our raised bed.
[10:35.370 --> 10:37.370]  We've got raised beds and a couple raised beds.
[10:37.370 --> 10:39.130]  Do you prefer the raised beds or the?
[10:39.130 --> 10:39.970]  Raised bed all day.
[10:39.970 --> 10:41.570]  Okay, Spencer seems to be loving those too.
[10:41.570 --> 10:44.090]  Shout out to the Garden of Weed Mountain in Washington.
[10:44.090 --> 10:46.330]  Okay, what's better about them?
[10:46.330 --> 10:49.010]  It's just with the way we do them,
[10:49.010 --> 10:51.490]  our raised beds are fed differently than we do our 20s.
[10:52.450 --> 10:55.130]  We actually get the Imbessa compost teas.
[10:55.130 --> 10:55.970]  Oh, cool.
[10:55.970 --> 10:57.370]  And we use those and we brew those.
[10:57.370 --> 10:58.930]  But for the raised bed it's been no-till
[10:58.930 --> 10:59.850]  and it's been going no-till.
[10:59.850 --> 11:01.130]  We haven't added any soil to it
[11:01.130 --> 11:03.570]  other than what goes in with the transplants.
[11:03.570 --> 11:05.610]  It's been like that since the opening of the greenhouse
[11:05.610 --> 11:06.570]  I think two years ago.
[11:06.570 --> 11:07.730]  Wow.
[11:07.730 --> 11:10.170]  And it's full of life, because we're all organic.
[11:10.170 --> 11:11.530]  It's full of life, full of microbes.
[11:11.530 --> 11:13.290]  And it's just really cool.
[11:13.290 --> 11:15.570]  The plants seem, they get a little bit bigger
[11:15.570 --> 11:16.410]  in the raised bed too.
[11:16.410 --> 11:18.890]  They've got more space for the roots to get out.
[11:18.890 --> 11:20.370]  And the flowers just always seem to be
[11:20.370 --> 11:22.130]  a little bit better out of the raised bed.
[11:22.130 --> 11:22.970]  Wow, that's really neat.
[11:22.970 --> 11:25.290]  We're trying to transition into complete all raised beds.
[11:25.290 --> 11:27.250]  Okay, keeping that life going in there.
[11:27.250 --> 11:28.090]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[11:28.090 --> 11:28.930]  All right, we'll talk more about that
[11:28.930 --> 11:30.610]  when we get to the next part here.
[11:30.610 --> 11:32.050]  So let's talk more about some of the stuff
[11:32.050 --> 11:33.010]  that you had to change
[11:33.010 --> 11:34.770]  and that you've noticed going to the big grow.
[11:34.770 --> 11:36.170]  Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
[11:36.170 --> 11:38.210]  Like, you know, the biggest I've ever had in my house
[11:38.210 --> 11:39.530]  is a 4K in a basement.
[11:39.530 --> 11:42.650]  And now we've got, what is it?
[11:42.650 --> 11:43.490]  I gotta run down here.
[11:43.490 --> 11:46.410]  We have 112 Govitas in each room.
[11:46.410 --> 11:47.730]  So we've got 224 lights.
[11:47.730 --> 11:50.130]  So I'm going from four lights to 224 now.
[11:50.850 --> 11:52.650]  Just getting used to the size of the plants
[11:52.650 --> 11:53.930]  and how often I gotta water them
[11:53.930 --> 11:56.290]  and how much I gotta water them really changed.
[11:57.530 --> 11:59.210]  It was just basically,
[11:59.210 --> 12:01.290]  it put into perspective how little
[12:01.290 --> 12:03.210]  I actually was doing at my house.
[12:03.210 --> 12:05.170]  It made my growing at home a lot easier, to be honest.
[12:05.170 --> 12:06.410]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[12:06.410 --> 12:07.250]  I feel the same.
[12:07.250 --> 12:08.530]  I've got a hobby grow now.
[12:08.530 --> 12:09.530]  Exactly, it's like, wow,
[12:09.530 --> 12:12.090]  I used to think that watering these 20 plants was hard.
[12:12.090 --> 12:14.330]  I was like, oh, I gotta water my 20 plants now.
[12:14.330 --> 12:17.490]  But now I'm watering 320 every day.
[12:17.490 --> 12:18.450]  320 every day.
[12:18.490 --> 12:20.410]  Doing maintenance on them, defoliating,
[12:20.410 --> 12:23.490]  checking for bugs, making sure there's no problems,
[12:23.490 --> 12:25.930]  putting supporting sticks everywhere you need to.
[12:25.930 --> 12:27.010]  Oh, stake city.
[12:27.010 --> 12:28.010]  It's an MED grow,
[12:28.010 --> 12:30.450]  so you gotta make sure that everything is tagged properly.
[12:30.450 --> 12:32.170]  Yeah, that was one thing that was really crazy.
[12:32.170 --> 12:34.290]  It was going and getting,
[12:34.290 --> 12:35.610]  because I had never done anything
[12:35.610 --> 12:37.810]  other than a basement grow until I got here.
[12:37.810 --> 12:40.530]  I never worked in any dispensary.
[12:40.530 --> 12:41.570]  I've never been in the industry ever.
[12:41.570 --> 12:43.930]  I got my badge and started working there.
[12:43.930 --> 12:45.570]  And so that was one thing that was crazy
[12:45.610 --> 12:50.610]  was seeing how heavily everything has to be tagged, tracked.
[12:50.970 --> 12:51.810]  If you get rid of it,
[12:51.810 --> 12:54.690]  you have to make sure that you get rid of it in the computer
[12:54.690 --> 12:55.930]  and throw it in the right basket
[12:55.930 --> 12:57.930]  and incinerate the basket.
[13:00.410 --> 13:01.530]  That was crazy to me.
[13:01.530 --> 13:02.690]  Yeah, it's still crazy to me.
[13:02.690 --> 13:05.570]  It's overkill, but I like the overkill, kind of.
[13:05.570 --> 13:07.090]  Me too, me too.
[13:07.090 --> 13:09.050]  I feel like it keeps everybody in check
[13:09.050 --> 13:12.290]  and it keeps the people that shouldn't be doing it,
[13:12.290 --> 13:13.690]  it keeps them kind of at bay.
[13:13.690 --> 13:14.770]  It creates a standard.
[13:15.410 --> 13:16.850]  And if you can't live up to that standard,
[13:16.850 --> 13:18.770]  then you shouldn't be growing this product.
[13:18.770 --> 13:20.050]  This is a medical product.
[13:20.050 --> 13:22.570]  It's also a recreational product for a lot of people,
[13:22.570 --> 13:25.130]  but I think that recreational use is also medical,
[13:25.130 --> 13:26.770]  if that makes sense.
[13:26.770 --> 13:27.610]  Definitely.
[13:27.610 --> 13:30.970]  Yeah, it's my recreational, yeah.
[13:30.970 --> 13:32.610]  It's my freedom, it's my fun.
[13:32.610 --> 13:34.130]  Yeah, it's my vice, it's my fun.
[13:34.130 --> 13:36.930]  I don't, I'm getting too old to go to too many concerts
[13:36.930 --> 13:38.210]  and go do ridiculous shit.
[13:38.210 --> 13:40.890]  I'm just gonna take some dabs and play on my phone.
[13:40.890 --> 13:42.450]  I'm cool with that for a minute sometimes now.
[13:42.450 --> 13:44.450]  Yeah, it's my recreational outlet.
[13:45.370 --> 13:48.130]  So man, 320 giant plants.
[13:48.130 --> 13:49.770]  You defoliate that all yourself,
[13:49.770 --> 13:51.490]  pest management all yourself?
[13:51.490 --> 13:53.450]  We kind of all, there's six of us that work there,
[13:53.450 --> 13:57.210]  six growers for, we have 1,280 plants and flower
[13:57.210 --> 14:00.770]  and about 700 in veg, 400 in the T5s
[14:00.770 --> 14:02.170]  and another 600 clones.
[14:02.170 --> 14:03.010]  Wow.
[14:03.010 --> 14:04.090]  And six of us manage that.
[14:05.490 --> 14:08.890]  And so, we have our spray days on Wednesday and Saturday
[14:08.890 --> 14:11.530]  and we've got, I think I sent you that sprayer we had
[14:11.530 --> 14:12.490]  that one time you saw that.
[14:12.490 --> 14:13.330]  Yeah.
[14:13.370 --> 14:14.210]  The crazy one.
[14:14.210 --> 14:15.050]  Thing's huge.
[14:15.050 --> 14:16.970]  And so we just have, everybody kind of rotates
[14:16.970 --> 14:20.770]  how we spray, but we spray two days a week
[14:20.770 --> 14:23.410]  all the way through up until like the last week.
[14:23.410 --> 14:25.290]  But we are, like I said, all organic.
[14:25.290 --> 14:27.250]  We're spraying 100% organic neem oil
[14:27.250 --> 14:29.130]  and 100% organic essentials.
[14:29.130 --> 14:30.570]  No chemicals or nothing on there.
[14:30.570 --> 14:31.410]  Awesome.
[14:31.410 --> 14:32.250]  So it's all food.
[14:32.250 --> 14:33.890]  All right, let's kind of transition to that part
[14:33.890 --> 14:36.730]  because that's something that I've definitely noticed
[14:36.730 --> 14:38.650]  since you started working at this place.
[14:38.650 --> 14:40.890]  Your home grow has completely switched
[14:40.890 --> 14:42.090]  to fully organic now, right?
[14:42.090 --> 14:43.010]  Yes, 100%.
[14:43.690 --> 14:44.530]  Was that inspired by this place?
[14:44.530 --> 14:46.650]  It was inspired by a few different things, to be honest.
[14:46.650 --> 14:48.490]  I started working there and when I got in the grow,
[14:48.490 --> 14:50.170]  I was watering my plants and so I needed something
[14:50.170 --> 14:53.050]  to listen to and I started listening to old podcast episodes
[14:53.050 --> 14:54.490]  of yours that I hadn't listened to since I lived
[14:54.490 --> 14:55.570]  in North Carolina.
[14:55.570 --> 14:57.010]  So I figured, I've learned a couple of new things.
[14:57.010 --> 14:59.170]  Let me see if I can take anything new from these.
[14:59.170 --> 15:02.130]  And I was listening to the episodes of when Sean came on.
[15:02.130 --> 15:03.370]  Sean, shout out to King Cola.
[15:03.370 --> 15:05.890]  And yeah, he really, he was so passionate about it.
[15:05.890 --> 15:07.050]  And that was kind of cool to me.
[15:07.050 --> 15:08.450]  And I was like, oh, these things are pretty cool.
[15:08.450 --> 15:09.530]  I'm learning about what I'm doing here.
[15:09.530 --> 15:10.570]  I'm doing the work.
[15:10.570 --> 15:12.410]  And then I also started hanging out Frosty.
[15:12.810 --> 15:14.650]  Frosty Organics on Instagram.
[15:14.650 --> 15:15.490]  Shout out to Frosty, yeah.
[15:15.490 --> 15:16.410]  And he's the same way.
[15:16.410 --> 15:17.810]  He's super passionate about it.
[15:17.810 --> 15:19.530]  And he was all like, he was throwing,
[15:19.530 --> 15:20.930]  dropping knowledge on me every day.
[15:20.930 --> 15:23.610]  And one day I just was like, you know what?
[15:23.610 --> 15:25.250]  I was gonna do, I had my outdoor going.
[15:25.250 --> 15:27.370]  And I was like, I'm gonna do a raised bed, no-till,
[15:27.370 --> 15:29.250]  organic outdoor for the summer and see how much
[15:29.250 --> 15:31.330]  I like organic and I might switch to it.
[15:31.330 --> 15:32.250]  Then I was like, you know what?
[15:32.250 --> 15:33.810]  Why don't I just completely go organic?
[15:33.810 --> 15:36.530]  It's so much, I feel like it's so much, I know it's better.
[15:36.530 --> 15:39.370]  Like I just, I know it's just, I don't know.
[15:39.370 --> 15:41.850]  So I made the switch completely and now that I've been
[15:42.290 --> 15:45.130]  doing it, I've had one full complete, like from,
[15:45.130 --> 15:47.130]  because I switched kind of halfway through a cycle.
[15:47.130 --> 15:47.970]  I was like, you know what?
[15:47.970 --> 15:48.970]  I'm not gonna use these bottles anymore.
[15:48.970 --> 15:49.890]  I'm organic now.
[15:49.890 --> 15:50.730]  Nice.
[15:50.730 --> 15:53.450]  And so I had plants and veg and then plants halfway
[15:53.450 --> 15:55.450]  through flower, went through that cycle.
[15:55.450 --> 15:56.890]  The plants and veg came through and I went through it.
[15:56.890 --> 15:58.490]  But I just now, just like last week,
[15:58.490 --> 16:01.690]  took it down my first from seed to harvest,
[16:01.690 --> 16:03.610]  like 100% fully organic.
[16:03.610 --> 16:04.450]  Sweet.
[16:04.450 --> 16:06.010]  And it's by far the best, best grow I've ever had.
[16:06.010 --> 16:07.490]  Best personal grow I've ever had.
[16:07.490 --> 16:08.370]  That's great to hear.
[16:08.370 --> 16:09.210]  Nice, congrats.
[16:09.210 --> 16:10.050]  Thank you.
[16:10.050 --> 16:10.890]  So you're gonna continue that path for sure.
[16:11.130 --> 16:11.970]  Yeah, 100%.
[16:11.970 --> 16:14.250]  Are you going to eventually turn your home grow
[16:14.250 --> 16:15.330]  into no-till?
[16:15.330 --> 16:16.170]  Yeah, that's what I wanna do.
[16:16.170 --> 16:18.370]  I mean, I'm doing no-till soil right now.
[16:18.370 --> 16:20.370]  Like I'm reusing the soil that I have in the pots.
[16:20.370 --> 16:22.290]  I'm using seven gallon pots and just taking the root ball
[16:22.290 --> 16:23.570]  out and putting the two gals in.
[16:23.570 --> 16:26.850]  Do you wanna teach my listeners just briefly a quick lesson
[16:26.850 --> 16:27.690]  on no-till?
[16:27.690 --> 16:29.090]  Because I don't think we've covered too much no-till
[16:29.090 --> 16:29.930]  on the podcast.
[16:29.930 --> 16:31.170]  Sure, I'll say as much as I know,
[16:31.170 --> 16:32.530]  I'm by no means an expert on it.
[16:32.530 --> 16:33.850]  I'm new to this thing as well.
[16:33.850 --> 16:37.650]  But it's basically no-till soil is when you have a soil
[16:37.650 --> 16:39.690]  that you've amended yourself and you've planted the plant
[16:39.970 --> 16:44.890]  and you just feed it top dressings and whatever teas
[16:44.890 --> 16:45.970]  you wanna do, whatever you gotta do.
[16:45.970 --> 16:46.890]  You've got worms in there.
[16:46.890 --> 16:48.970]  You've got a lot of microbe life going in there.
[16:48.970 --> 16:51.210]  And it's after three years, I believe,
[16:51.210 --> 16:52.130]  that you've been running the soil.
[16:52.130 --> 16:55.890]  You never actually like take the soil up or put new soil.
[16:55.890 --> 16:58.770]  You reuse the soil every time, just taking the root ball out
[16:58.770 --> 17:01.210]  and putting a new plant in, reusing the old dirt,
[17:01.210 --> 17:03.450]  trying to just no-till.
[17:03.450 --> 17:06.970]  You wanna irritate the land as little as possible.
[17:06.970 --> 17:09.450]  And after three years, it's basically self-sustaining.
[17:10.210 --> 17:11.450]  All you need to do is add water.
[17:11.450 --> 17:12.290]  Wow.
[17:12.290 --> 17:13.330]  Yeah, but with the no-till,
[17:13.330 --> 17:15.170]  it's just you've got a lot of microbe life living in there.
[17:15.170 --> 17:17.770]  You've got a lot of microorganisms breaking everything down.
[17:17.770 --> 17:20.050]  Your plants are really, really, really gonna thrive
[17:20.050 --> 17:23.370]  in a well-maintained no-till environment
[17:23.370 --> 17:26.330]  because you're not really feeding your plants at that point.
[17:26.330 --> 17:29.410]  You're feeding these microorganisms that live in your soil
[17:29.410 --> 17:31.490]  and then they're gonna absorb all these things
[17:31.490 --> 17:33.970]  that you're feeding them, release them back into the soil.
[17:33.970 --> 17:35.970]  And that's what your plants are gonna uptake.
[17:35.970 --> 17:38.010]  And it's a cycle of life.
[17:38.010 --> 17:39.010]  It's how things are meant to be
[17:39.010 --> 17:41.770]  and you're just carefully maintaining it there.
[17:41.770 --> 17:43.490]  It allows the plant to eat what it wants
[17:43.490 --> 17:45.170]  at exactly the ratios it wants.
[17:45.170 --> 17:46.730]  You're not force feeding it some bottle.
[17:46.730 --> 17:48.690]  You're not holding it down, putting a nipple on a bottle,
[17:48.690 --> 17:50.450]  trying to shove some formula in its mouth.
[17:50.450 --> 17:51.650]  Yeah, they love it. It's beautiful.
[17:51.650 --> 17:54.810]  Okay, and so how long does it take to,
[17:54.810 --> 17:58.090]  can I almost take, if I grow a crop now that's not no-till,
[17:58.090 --> 17:59.770]  oh, because it's not amended, so I can't do it.
[17:59.770 --> 18:01.130]  Nevermind, I think I know the answer.
[18:01.130 --> 18:02.810]  I was gonna ask if I could take a plant
[18:02.810 --> 18:04.450]  that I'm gonna harvest tomorrow,
[18:04.450 --> 18:06.450]  chop the plant, pull the root ball out.
[18:06.450 --> 18:09.370]  Can I now start my no-till process with that soil
[18:09.370 --> 18:12.170]  or do I need to pre-prep my pot at the beginning?
[18:12.170 --> 18:13.690]  You probably could, you know what I'm saying?
[18:13.690 --> 18:16.090]  But it would probably be best to start it
[18:16.090 --> 18:17.250]  in an amended soil.
[18:17.250 --> 18:18.090]  Okay.
[18:18.090 --> 18:19.410]  So that way, you've already got,
[18:19.410 --> 18:21.210]  your soil is already inoculated.
[18:21.210 --> 18:23.610]  You've got life all the way from the top to the bottom.
[18:23.610 --> 18:24.970]  Because if you're just throwing a new plant in there
[18:24.970 --> 18:26.970]  at that point, you're kind of just,
[18:26.970 --> 18:29.530]  it's gonna take a couple of weeks for it to take off really
[18:29.530 --> 18:32.090]  because it's not gonna have any of the,
[18:32.090 --> 18:34.410]  there's no life in there to give it food.
[18:34.410 --> 18:35.250]  It's gotta fire up. Exactly.
[18:35.250 --> 18:36.090]  It's gotta get going.
[18:36.730 --> 18:37.570]  It's gonna be searching for food
[18:37.570 --> 18:39.250]  and it's not gonna take off for, yeah,
[18:39.250 --> 18:40.090]  probably a week or two.
[18:40.090 --> 18:40.930]  Okay.
[18:40.930 --> 18:41.770]  But yeah.
[18:41.770 --> 18:42.610]  It sounds like a great method.
[18:42.610 --> 18:43.930]  It could do it, that's for sure.
[18:43.930 --> 18:45.570]  Sounds like a great method.
[18:45.570 --> 18:47.090]  Shout out to Lindsay, the traveling stoner.
[18:47.090 --> 18:48.730]  She just called while we're trying to do a podcast.
[18:48.730 --> 18:49.810]  Lindsay, I hope you're listening.
[18:49.810 --> 18:52.810]  I'll call you back after we get done recording.
[18:52.810 --> 18:55.490]  She's not live, but she definitely listens to every episode.
[18:55.490 --> 18:56.770]  She'll hear this part.
[18:56.770 --> 18:57.610]  I know what she wants.
[18:57.610 --> 18:58.850]  I know what she wants to talk about.
[18:58.850 --> 19:00.970]  She got a new carb cap in that I'm excited about.
[19:00.970 --> 19:02.930]  It's, I think it's called a clit cap.
[19:02.930 --> 19:04.490]  It's in the shape of a vagina.
[19:04.490 --> 19:05.330]  There you go.
[19:05.370 --> 19:07.770]  Carb cap and it looks like a vagina on the rig.
[19:07.770 --> 19:09.610]  She wants to take dabs and use that.
[19:09.610 --> 19:10.450]  All right.
[19:10.450 --> 19:11.610]  So where are we on my notes?
[19:11.610 --> 19:13.050]  We got distracted here.
[19:13.050 --> 19:14.250]  The no-till, that sounds great.
[19:14.250 --> 19:15.330]  I kind of want to get into that.
[19:15.330 --> 19:16.890]  It sounds like something that's sustainable.
[19:16.890 --> 19:17.770]  Yeah, it's fun.
[19:17.770 --> 19:18.610]  It's cool.
[19:18.610 --> 19:19.970]  You learn a lot.
[19:19.970 --> 19:20.810]  It's fun.
[19:20.810 --> 19:21.650]  I don't know.
[19:21.650 --> 19:22.490]  It's really hard to explain.
[19:22.490 --> 19:23.690]  You just get a better, you feel more like,
[19:23.690 --> 19:25.290]  it sounds cheesy, but you feel more in sync
[19:25.290 --> 19:27.050]  with your plants when you're like,
[19:27.050 --> 19:28.530]  when you're controlling their environment.
[19:28.530 --> 19:30.250]  Well, I did sort of a,
[19:30.250 --> 19:32.250]  when Sean was here often and we all got it,
[19:32.250 --> 19:34.610]  when I was being sponsored by the Rocky Mountain Worm Company,
[19:34.610 --> 19:37.050]  big shout out to Jay from the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[19:37.050 --> 19:39.170]  They were sponsoring me and they were actually giving me
[19:39.170 --> 19:40.610]  all of the amendments that I needed
[19:40.610 --> 19:42.690]  to do everything organically.
[19:42.690 --> 19:45.130]  I really loved my product and I loved,
[19:45.130 --> 19:46.610]  I felt like a farmer, you know what I mean?
[19:46.610 --> 19:47.450]  Yeah, exactly.
[19:47.450 --> 19:49.010]  I had worm shit underneath my fingernails
[19:49.010 --> 19:52.130]  and I smelled like fish emulsion
[19:52.130 --> 19:53.730]  and I was just funky, you know what I mean?
[19:53.730 --> 19:55.570]  I've got a Neiman Kelp Tea brewing at my house right now.
[19:55.570 --> 19:58.530]  I'm going to walk in the door and it's going to just smell.
[19:58.530 --> 20:00.770]  I'm going to smell that Kelp meal as soon as I walk in.
[20:00.770 --> 20:03.010]  I love walking in and you've got the five gallon bucket
[20:03.050 --> 20:05.050]  of tea brewing and there's foam three feet high off of it.
[20:05.050 --> 20:06.490]  Yeah, it's like coming off the edge a little bit.
[20:06.490 --> 20:07.330]  Yeah, I love that.
[20:07.330 --> 20:08.170]  I love it.
[20:08.170 --> 20:10.050]  But I also, I ran at Green and Healthy,
[20:10.050 --> 20:14.370]  we did nutrients that came out of big five gallon jugs into,
[20:14.370 --> 20:15.930]  I put them into basically a beaker
[20:15.930 --> 20:17.570]  and then put those into a reservoir
[20:17.570 --> 20:19.490]  and mixed it and adjusted the pH.
[20:19.490 --> 20:22.210]  And I did it with like goggles on and gloves
[20:22.210 --> 20:23.610]  and it felt very scientific.
[20:23.610 --> 20:25.930]  And I liked that as well for some fun reason,
[20:25.930 --> 20:26.810]  you know what I mean?
[20:26.810 --> 20:28.210]  And now at home I'm running,
[20:29.330 --> 20:31.010]  I like botanic hair bottles.
[20:31.010 --> 20:32.090]  It's simple for what I do.
[20:32.090 --> 20:35.290]  I breed and so I don't need to do a lot of crazy shit
[20:35.290 --> 20:36.130]  for what I'm breeding with.
[20:36.130 --> 20:37.890]  And the botanic hair is perfect.
[20:38.850 --> 20:40.730]  I like mixing the bottles a little bit.
[20:40.730 --> 20:42.130]  I put some worm castings in there.
[20:42.130 --> 20:43.890]  There's organic amendments in the soil,
[20:43.890 --> 20:45.570]  but when it comes time to feed a little bit,
[20:45.570 --> 20:47.210]  I grab the bottles of botanic hair.
[20:47.210 --> 20:48.890]  It seems to be the easiest way for me.
[20:48.890 --> 20:50.250]  But I shifted so much.
[20:50.250 --> 20:51.730]  I did a bunch of veg bloom.
[20:51.730 --> 20:55.170]  I've got veg bloom that'll probably go in the next cycle.
[20:55.170 --> 20:56.010]  I've actually noticed,
[20:56.010 --> 20:57.410]  I wanted to save this for a whole episode.
[20:57.410 --> 21:00.330]  I've noticed that, we'll do an episode about this.
[21:00.330 --> 21:03.250]  Certain strains actually prefer certain nutrients.
[21:03.250 --> 21:04.810]  I've noticed that if I,
[21:04.810 --> 21:07.170]  because I've ran, I've been doing this for a long time.
[21:07.170 --> 21:08.970]  I've ran so many nutrient lines
[21:08.970 --> 21:10.810]  and I've had flow for 10 years.
[21:10.810 --> 21:12.890]  And I've noticed that if I run flow with this brand,
[21:12.890 --> 21:13.730]  it acts this way.
[21:13.730 --> 21:16.050]  If I run flow with this brand, it acts this way.
[21:16.050 --> 21:16.890]  Different brands,
[21:16.890 --> 21:19.410]  because I've had the same grow room set up for so long.
[21:19.410 --> 21:21.970]  And yeah, the blood change from different nutrients.
[21:21.970 --> 21:24.010]  Psycho made everything real colorful and fluffy,
[21:24.010 --> 21:25.490]  but I hated the flavor.
[21:25.490 --> 21:27.570]  So, and Advanced Nutrients made everything taste
[21:27.570 --> 21:29.850]  exactly the same, but I got huge buds,
[21:30.370 --> 21:31.810]  but everything tasted exactly the same.
[21:31.810 --> 21:33.970]  That was, I think Advanced might've been
[21:33.970 --> 21:35.610]  one of the first brands I tried to use.
[21:35.610 --> 21:36.570]  Nice. Yeah.
[21:36.570 --> 21:37.970]  I started with Mills.
[21:37.970 --> 21:38.930]  Oh, Mills pays the bills.
[21:38.930 --> 21:39.770]  Mills pays the bills.
[21:39.770 --> 21:40.610]  I've seen good work with Mills.
[21:40.610 --> 21:41.450]  Yeah, it was tight.
[21:41.450 --> 21:43.130]  I liked, I mean, when I was,
[21:43.130 --> 21:43.970]  it was cool.
[21:43.970 --> 21:45.130]  I liked the results that I was getting,
[21:45.130 --> 21:47.290]  but I don't know.
[21:47.290 --> 21:49.290]  The organic is just, it's, I don't know.
[21:49.290 --> 21:50.570]  Like I said, it's more fun to me.
[21:50.570 --> 21:51.410]  Yeah, yeah.
[21:51.410 --> 21:55.290]  Like I just, I feel like I'm doing more.
[21:55.290 --> 21:56.330]  I don't know, it's hard to explain.
[21:56.330 --> 21:57.170]  Like it's more-
[21:57.170 --> 21:58.010]  I'm gonna write no till.
[21:58.010 --> 22:01.250]  Look, I've grabbed this, I've got a pencil dabber.
[22:01.250 --> 22:04.650]  This is actually, it looks like a green colored pencil,
[22:04.650 --> 22:06.010]  and it's actually a glass dabber.
[22:06.010 --> 22:07.890]  I just grabbed this to try to make a note.
[22:07.890 --> 22:10.130]  So I'm gonna reach this way and not look like a dumbass
[22:10.130 --> 22:10.970]  and grab a pen.
[22:12.570 --> 22:13.490]  There we go, and I'll make a note.
[22:13.490 --> 22:15.330]  We're gonna do a no till episode in the future.
[22:15.330 --> 22:16.730]  You get Frosty on here for that one.
[22:16.730 --> 22:17.930]  Yeah, ooh, okay.
[22:17.930 --> 22:20.050]  Does Frosty live in Pueblo or Springs?
[22:20.050 --> 22:20.890]  He lives in Pueblo.
[22:20.890 --> 22:21.970]  I thought he was a Springs kid.
[22:21.970 --> 22:23.810]  Frosty, why haven't you been on the podcast, bro?
[22:23.810 --> 22:24.650]  You need to get him out of here.
[22:24.650 --> 22:25.770]  Dude, Frosty, if you listen to this,
[22:25.770 --> 22:28.370]  just text me or message me on Instagram or Facebook
[22:28.370 --> 22:30.370]  right now and be like, how do I get on your podcast?
[22:30.370 --> 22:32.370]  And if not, I'll get Will to put me in touch with you
[22:32.370 --> 22:33.610]  or I'll hit you up on Instagram
[22:33.610 --> 22:34.690]  and we'll get you on the podcast.
[22:34.690 --> 22:35.930]  We'll talk about no till,
[22:35.930 --> 22:37.730]  because I'm sure a lot of our listeners are like,
[22:37.730 --> 22:39.650]  I wanna know the recipe for the soil,
[22:39.650 --> 22:41.210]  but we're gonna tease them and we're gonna make them listen
[22:41.210 --> 22:42.530]  to the no till episode for that.
[22:42.530 --> 22:43.530]  That's gonna be rad.
[22:43.530 --> 22:44.370]  Nice.
[22:44.370 --> 22:46.130]  Yeah, so you guys just got teased on two cool episodes
[22:46.130 --> 22:47.850]  that are gonna be coming up.
[22:47.850 --> 22:49.330]  So there are worms in there.
[22:49.330 --> 22:51.730]  Yes, lots of worms, lots and lots and lots of worms.
[22:51.730 --> 22:52.930]  How large is your raised bed?
[22:52.930 --> 22:55.750]  I'm guessing three by three or four by four?
[22:56.590 --> 22:57.430]  Yeah.
[22:57.430 --> 23:01.150]  It is about three feet tall, but then it goes like-
[23:01.150 --> 23:01.990]  Oh, it's long.
[23:01.990 --> 23:03.430]  All the way down.
[23:03.430 --> 23:04.830]  We have 40 plants in it.
[23:04.830 --> 23:05.670]  Okay.
[23:05.670 --> 23:07.110]  So it goes, there's a really, really, really, really long.
[23:07.110 --> 23:08.870]  I was just gonna ask how many worms are in there.
[23:08.870 --> 23:10.390]  Like how many did you put in there?
[23:10.390 --> 23:11.390]  Oh, they've been in there for,
[23:11.390 --> 23:12.950]  we haven't had any new worms in forever.
[23:12.950 --> 23:13.790]  They've just been in there.
[23:13.790 --> 23:14.750]  Oh, that's awesome.
[23:14.750 --> 23:15.910]  Worms multiply pretty quickly.
[23:15.910 --> 23:16.750]  Yeah.
[23:16.750 --> 23:18.510]  Yeah, and there's so many in there.
[23:18.510 --> 23:19.350]  That's so awesome.
[23:19.350 --> 23:20.190]  Yeah, it's tight.
[23:20.190 --> 23:21.430]  Oh man, I wanna go see that.
[23:21.430 --> 23:23.150]  Yeah, you can come down and check it out if you want to.
[23:23.150 --> 23:23.990]  Okay.
[23:23.990 --> 23:24.830]  Yeah, I'm in.
[23:24.830 --> 23:25.670]  Yeah, sounds great to me.
[23:26.470 --> 23:27.310]  I'd love to come check it out.
[23:27.310 --> 23:29.070]  I haven't gone to enough big outdoor grows this year
[23:29.070 --> 23:29.910]  for some reason.
[23:29.910 --> 23:31.550]  I'm gonna bring you guys some genetics or,
[23:31.550 --> 23:32.750]  oh, we can't do that anymore.
[23:32.750 --> 23:34.990]  It's not the, yeah, more of that.
[23:34.990 --> 23:36.190]  So we were gonna say earlier
[23:36.190 --> 23:37.710]  that you gotta label everything.
[23:37.710 --> 23:39.990]  Everything's gotta be tagged by the MED.
[23:39.990 --> 23:41.910]  So I can't just grab a clone and drive over there
[23:41.910 --> 23:43.030]  and be like, here's a clone, you guys.
[23:43.030 --> 23:44.110]  Now you have Capleton.
[23:44.110 --> 23:44.950]  Good luck.
[23:44.950 --> 23:45.790]  That'd be tight.
[23:45.790 --> 23:47.990]  Yeah, I'd bring you some 31% tested genetics.
[23:47.990 --> 23:48.830]  Oh yeah.
[23:48.830 --> 23:49.790]  Yeah, it'd be fun over there.
[23:49.790 --> 23:50.630]  Oh yeah.
[23:50.630 --> 23:51.470]  All right.
[23:51.470 --> 23:53.310]  So what's next?
[23:53.310 --> 23:54.350]  What's the next evolution?
[23:54.350 --> 23:56.630]  If you go all full no-till,
[23:56.630 --> 24:00.670]  then what's the next way to improve your garden after that?
[24:00.670 --> 24:02.590]  I mean, once you're at no-till, you do your thing.
[24:02.590 --> 24:04.910]  You figure out some good top dress recipes, really.
[24:04.910 --> 24:06.950]  Because by that point, if you've got a full on no-till,
[24:06.950 --> 24:08.310]  like Mountain Organics,
[24:08.310 --> 24:11.430]  everybody on Instagram really wants to see some really,
[24:11.430 --> 24:13.230]  I mean, this guy is where I discovered no-till
[24:13.230 --> 24:14.110]  from a couple years back
[24:14.110 --> 24:15.550]  before I even knew what no-till was.
[24:15.550 --> 24:17.390]  I was following this guy, Mountain Organics.
[24:17.390 --> 24:20.670]  He's got the tech down with the no-till.
[24:20.670 --> 24:22.510]  But yeah, once you've got it going
[24:22.510 --> 24:23.670]  for that many cycles,
[24:23.870 --> 24:25.630]  you know what you need.
[24:25.630 --> 24:28.510]  And I really don't think there's much more you can do
[24:28.510 --> 24:29.830]  other than just kind of like seeing
[24:29.830 --> 24:30.910]  if anything new comes out,
[24:30.910 --> 24:33.390]  you know, if a new style or something comes out.
[24:33.390 --> 24:35.230]  Just taking care of the plants.
[24:35.230 --> 24:36.070]  Yeah, exactly.
[24:36.070 --> 24:36.910]  New genetics.
[24:36.910 --> 24:37.750]  Yep, exactly.
[24:37.750 --> 24:38.590]  Or phenohunting.
[24:38.590 --> 24:39.990]  You said that you use Easy Cloners at the Big Grow
[24:39.990 --> 24:42.590]  when we were talking before the show.
[24:42.590 --> 24:44.030]  How do you do those organically?
[24:44.030 --> 24:45.270]  Just curious.
[24:45.270 --> 24:48.590]  It's OMRIs, what is it?
[24:48.590 --> 24:49.710]  It's the Hormex.
[24:49.710 --> 24:50.550]  Okay.
[24:50.550 --> 24:51.390]  Yeah, Hormex and some RO.
[24:51.390 --> 24:52.390]  Okay.
[24:52.390 --> 24:53.230]  Yeah.
[24:53.750 --> 24:54.950]  For the Easy Cloner.
[24:54.950 --> 24:55.790]  We do some of them.
[24:55.790 --> 24:58.670]  We just started using this inoculant
[24:58.670 --> 25:01.750]  from Mountain Organics, actually.
[25:01.750 --> 25:04.230]  That is supposed to be the truth.
[25:04.230 --> 25:05.070]  So we'll see.
[25:05.070 --> 25:06.150]  We actually just started using that last week.
[25:06.150 --> 25:06.990]  Nice.
[25:06.990 --> 25:08.310]  And so, yeah.
[25:08.310 --> 25:12.030]  I was told that inside of the Clonex dipping gel
[25:12.030 --> 25:13.230]  that I use for my cloner,
[25:13.230 --> 25:14.790]  that there is a,
[25:14.790 --> 25:16.070]  excuse me for the throat clearing,
[25:16.070 --> 25:20.510]  that there is a chemical called purple lavender dye,
[25:20.510 --> 25:21.430]  I think is what it is.
[25:22.110 --> 25:24.270]  I think it's purple lavender dye.
[25:24.270 --> 25:25.110]  And a friend of mine was like,
[25:25.110 --> 25:26.310]  oh dude, don't use that shit
[25:26.310 --> 25:27.230]  because he saw it on my shelf.
[25:27.230 --> 25:28.190]  And he's actually,
[25:29.430 --> 25:30.310]  I don't know his degree,
[25:30.310 --> 25:31.390]  but he's got college degrees.
[25:31.390 --> 25:32.230]  And when he saw it, he's like,
[25:32.230 --> 25:34.270]  no, he kind of freaked out on me.
[25:34.270 --> 25:35.510]  Yeah, apparently Clonex is a no-go.
[25:35.510 --> 25:36.510]  I used to use that too.
[25:36.510 --> 25:38.110]  Yeah, he told me to get rid of that shit.
[25:38.110 --> 25:40.230]  So you guys do some research.
[25:40.230 --> 25:41.510]  That purple velvet dye
[25:41.510 --> 25:44.070]  or purple crystalline velvet dye or something like that.
[25:44.070 --> 25:45.310]  I don't recall exactly.
[25:45.310 --> 25:47.590]  But if you Google Clonex, find the ingredients,
[25:47.590 --> 25:48.430]  that purple dye in there
[25:48.430 --> 25:49.670]  is supposed to be really bad for you.
[25:49.670 --> 25:51.790]  Also, there's something in there
[25:51.790 --> 25:54.190]  that it's really not good for you.
[25:54.190 --> 25:55.550]  If you get it on your hands and stuff,
[25:55.550 --> 25:57.270]  it could definitely cause you some problems.
[25:57.270 --> 25:59.110]  So go do some research on Clonex.
[25:59.110 --> 26:01.390]  That's why I was asking Will how they do it organically.
[26:01.390 --> 26:02.230]  Yeah, we do most of our,
[26:02.230 --> 26:03.550]  we only use the clone boxes.
[26:03.550 --> 26:04.910]  Those are like, we're trying to phase out of those.
[26:04.910 --> 26:06.430]  So we just have two of those right now.
[26:06.430 --> 26:10.230]  Most of our clones go into little root rights
[26:10.230 --> 26:13.230]  that we have packed into little one by one cubes
[26:13.230 --> 26:14.790]  with some Pro-Mix.
[26:14.790 --> 26:17.270]  And then just a little solution of RO, Aloe,
[26:17.270 --> 26:19.630]  and then some humic acids.
[26:20.190 --> 26:21.430]  From BioAg.
[26:21.430 --> 26:24.430]  And then we dip those in the aloe
[26:24.430 --> 26:26.470]  and just let those sit in the domes for two weeks
[26:26.470 --> 26:27.310]  and we're good to go.
[26:27.310 --> 26:28.150]  They seem to love aloe.
[26:28.150 --> 26:29.550]  Everybody's on the aloe kick now.
[26:29.550 --> 26:31.630]  Nice, you just using like liquid aloe or powder?
[26:31.630 --> 26:34.190]  No, we get just straight raw, cold pressed aloe.
[26:34.190 --> 26:35.550]  Just dip the cutting in that,
[26:35.550 --> 26:37.230]  put it right into the root riot.
[26:37.230 --> 26:39.470]  And with the, if you're putting it in your water,
[26:39.470 --> 26:42.510]  I mean, you need just a small, finite amount of aloe.
[26:42.510 --> 26:43.710]  There's a long, long way.
[26:43.710 --> 26:45.030]  Like for a whole 300 gallons,
[26:45.030 --> 26:47.130]  when we're watering our plants, we use one ounce.
[26:47.130 --> 26:47.970]  Oh shit, okay.
[26:47.970 --> 26:50.090]  So just one ounce, that's like a coffee cup, basically.
[26:50.090 --> 26:50.930]  That's a shot glass.
[26:50.930 --> 26:52.730]  A shot, oh yeah, a shot glass, 30 milliliters.
[26:52.730 --> 26:53.570]  30 something milliliters.
[26:53.570 --> 26:54.390]  Sorry, did I say 30 ounces?
[26:54.390 --> 26:55.230]  Or wait, did I say one ounce or 30 ounces?
[26:55.230 --> 26:56.130]  No, you said one ounce.
[26:56.130 --> 26:57.250]  I just overjudged it.
[26:57.250 --> 26:58.810]  I was thinking, yeah, I went way bigger.
[26:58.810 --> 27:00.330]  Yeah, okay, wow, nice.
[27:00.330 --> 27:01.490]  A lot of people are gonna be thinking,
[27:01.490 --> 27:03.050]  where can I get some powdered aloe?
[27:03.050 --> 27:04.890]  That's not something,
[27:04.890 --> 27:06.210]  if you've got a recommendation, go for it.
[27:06.210 --> 27:07.050]  Build a soil.
[27:07.050 --> 27:07.890]  That's what I was gonna say.
[27:07.890 --> 27:09.370]  They do not, I'm glad you said it before I did.
[27:09.370 --> 27:10.530]  They do not pay the podcast.
[27:10.530 --> 27:11.510]  They're not a sponsor.
[27:11.510 --> 27:13.210]  That's the place to go for that type of shit.
[27:13.210 --> 27:17.170]  You can get powdered coconut water, powdered aloe.
[27:17.170 --> 27:18.690]  Just go check out buildasoil.com.
[27:18.690 --> 27:19.530]  I recommend that.
[27:19.530 --> 27:22.250]  Everything, if you don't know anything about organics
[27:22.250 --> 27:24.850]  and don't know where to go and need,
[27:24.850 --> 27:26.130]  he's got everything you need on there
[27:26.130 --> 27:28.650]  to start doing organically from buying the supplies.
[27:28.650 --> 27:32.890]  And then he also has directions on how to clone,
[27:32.890 --> 27:35.370]  veg, flour, different top dress regimens.
[27:35.370 --> 27:36.630]  He's got everything you need to know on there.
[27:36.630 --> 27:38.010]  He's a real, real, real cool guy.
[27:38.010 --> 27:38.850]  Those guys are great.
[27:38.850 --> 27:40.850]  I haven't checked out their website in a little while,
[27:40.850 --> 27:42.250]  but yeah, I need to go check that out.
[27:42.250 --> 27:43.770]  It sounds like they've updated a whole bunch
[27:43.770 --> 27:44.910]  since I've done business with them.
[27:44.910 --> 27:46.150]  But yeah, they've got all your powdered,
[27:46.150 --> 27:47.170]  dry organic amendments,
[27:47.170 --> 27:48.490]  and they'll ship them to you everywhere.
[27:48.490 --> 27:50.250]  Yeah, they're here in Colorado, Fort Collins, I believe.
[27:50.250 --> 27:51.890]  Yeah, yeah, the great prices.
[27:51.890 --> 27:53.230]  Very affordable, they're reasonable.
[27:53.230 --> 27:54.490]  The more you buy, the cheaper it gets
[27:54.490 --> 27:56.270]  because they're powdered in their bulk.
[27:56.270 --> 27:58.350]  They don't waste a lot of money on a lot of packaging.
[27:58.350 --> 28:00.610]  So they're actually gonna make a little package up for you.
[28:00.610 --> 28:02.170]  They're gonna weigh it there in their warehouse.
[28:02.170 --> 28:03.950]  They're gonna ship out exactly what you order.
[28:03.950 --> 28:06.450]  Yeah, they've got great customer service.
[28:06.450 --> 28:08.610]  One time there was a weird, something weird with my order.
[28:08.610 --> 28:10.530]  I ordered like two things on the same day
[28:10.530 --> 28:11.650]  and wanted it to be in the same order,
[28:12.010 --> 28:14.050]  and I emailed him and he personally called me
[28:14.050 --> 28:15.990]  from his cell phone and got it worked out with me
[28:15.990 --> 28:18.570]  and got it all shipped out, no extra charge, nothing.
[28:18.570 --> 28:19.410]  That's really cool.
[28:19.410 --> 28:21.450]  Yeah, I love companies that do that kind of stuff.
[28:21.450 --> 28:22.290]  That was awesome.
[28:22.290 --> 28:24.130]  In the grow industry, there are a lot of companies
[28:24.130 --> 28:25.690]  that if they make a mistake, they go,
[28:25.690 --> 28:27.690]  oh, we've got your money, have a nice day.
[28:27.690 --> 28:29.450]  We'll either see you again or we won't
[28:29.450 --> 28:30.550]  because we get plenty of business
[28:30.550 --> 28:31.890]  from plenty of other people.
[28:31.890 --> 28:32.730]  Exactly.
[28:32.730 --> 28:33.550]  Yeah.
[28:33.550 --> 28:34.910]  I wrote down a whole bunch of notes,
[28:34.910 --> 28:36.090]  but you wrote down a bunch of notes too.
[28:36.090 --> 28:37.730]  I wanna make sure that we cover anything
[28:37.730 --> 28:39.330]  that you wanted to talk about.
[28:40.130 --> 28:41.450]  Oh, let's see here.
[28:45.010 --> 28:46.050]  Frosty.
[28:46.050 --> 28:46.930]  Shouted out Frosty.
[28:46.930 --> 28:47.890]  Yeah, Frosty's a good dude.
[28:47.890 --> 28:49.010]  I don't see that dude often enough.
[28:49.010 --> 28:50.610]  We have to make sure to give that dude a huge shout out.
[28:50.610 --> 28:52.650]  We're gonna get him on the show for no till.
[28:52.650 --> 28:53.530]  Frosty, don't be nervous.
[28:53.530 --> 28:54.890]  Just come on the show, bro.
[28:54.890 --> 28:55.710]  Come on the show.
[28:55.710 --> 28:57.410]  I guess the one thing I missed here
[28:58.530 --> 29:00.570]  is the Vortex brewers and irrigation systems
[29:00.570 --> 29:02.130]  that I learned at work.
[29:02.130 --> 29:02.970]  That stuff's pretty cool.
[29:02.970 --> 29:06.130]  If you're into brewing teas, combo season, everything,
[29:06.970 --> 29:09.010]  you know, the more agitation they get,
[29:09.010 --> 29:09.850]  the better.
[29:09.850 --> 29:12.250]  It's how they brew faster and it's gonna be a little stronger.
[29:12.250 --> 29:13.690]  The microbes are gonna be a little more active
[29:13.690 --> 29:16.690]  and if they brew more irrigated.
[29:16.690 --> 29:17.530]  Okay.
[29:17.530 --> 29:18.730]  So just using Airstones works,
[29:18.730 --> 29:21.810]  but the Vortex brewer, it's kind of self-explanatory.
[29:21.810 --> 29:24.030]  There's like, you know, it's a Vortex that spins inside.
[29:24.030 --> 29:26.370]  There's three tubes and it spins the water
[29:26.370 --> 29:27.610]  at a really fast, like a Vortex.
[29:27.610 --> 29:28.450]  Super fast.
[29:28.450 --> 29:29.270]  Yeah, super fast.
[29:29.270 --> 29:31.170]  Yeah, and it'll get, I mean, you'll get a tea brewing
[29:31.170 --> 29:33.410]  where you'll have bubbles popping up within minutes
[29:33.410 --> 29:35.410]  and it's not like there's no extra yucca in there
[29:35.410 --> 29:36.250]  or anything like that.
[29:36.250 --> 29:39.410]  It's just, it's just, it gets activated so quickly.
[29:39.410 --> 29:42.290]  I've actually seen guys clean out their Vortex brewer
[29:42.290 --> 29:44.450]  and put bubble bags in there and make hash in it.
[29:44.450 --> 29:45.290]  Oh, that's fun.
[29:45.290 --> 29:46.490]  Yeah, because it spins so rapidly.
[29:46.490 --> 29:47.330]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[29:47.330 --> 29:49.210]  Yeah, they totally make hash with it in the off season.
[29:49.210 --> 29:50.050]  That's funny.
[29:50.050 --> 29:51.570]  Yeah, so you harvest and clean it out,
[29:51.570 --> 29:53.330]  make some hash, then clean it out again
[29:53.330 --> 29:54.610]  and then put tea in it.
[29:54.610 --> 29:55.450]  That's awesome.
[29:55.450 --> 29:56.270]  And the irrigation system.
[29:56.270 --> 29:57.110]  What else were you gonna talk about the irrigation system?
[29:57.110 --> 29:58.970]  Yeah, the irrigation systems are cool.
[30:00.170 --> 30:01.610]  I could never be able to run one at my house
[30:01.610 --> 30:03.250]  because I mean, like I said, I run a 4K.
[30:03.250 --> 30:05.690]  I have like at most 40 plants inside,
[30:05.690 --> 30:08.530]  but it's really cool.
[30:08.530 --> 30:10.730]  It's, you know, I'm sure most people know about it
[30:10.730 --> 30:12.250]  with their growers, but for those of you that don't,
[30:12.250 --> 30:15.650]  it's a irrigation system is basically a self-watering system
[30:15.650 --> 30:18.090]  that you put a little emitter in each pot
[30:18.090 --> 30:21.530]  or down the line of the raised bed and you turn on a motor
[30:21.530 --> 30:24.050]  and it just sucks all the water out of the tank
[30:24.050 --> 30:26.570]  and gives each plant the exact same amount of water.
[30:26.570 --> 30:28.830]  It cuts the watering time from like an hour and a half
[30:28.830 --> 30:29.970]  to about 20 minutes.
[30:29.970 --> 30:31.130]  Right.
[30:31.130 --> 30:32.970]  The time it takes you to build that system
[30:33.650 --> 30:34.490]  saves you so much time.
[30:34.490 --> 30:35.330]  Oh my gosh, yeah.
[30:35.330 --> 30:36.250]  I've been telling all of the listeners
[30:36.250 --> 30:38.650]  that we're gonna talk about building a watering system.
[30:38.650 --> 30:40.490]  So you just teased it again.
[30:40.490 --> 30:42.050]  I've got it halfway written.
[30:42.050 --> 30:43.730]  Like I've got about halfway written.
[30:43.730 --> 30:45.090]  It's kind of very specific.
[30:45.090 --> 30:46.530]  It's for your needs.
[30:46.530 --> 30:47.550]  I've got a guideline written.
[30:47.550 --> 30:49.210]  So we'll put that out pretty soon here.
[30:49.210 --> 30:50.530]  I can record that one and like,
[30:50.530 --> 30:51.690]  it'll take me less than an hour.
[30:51.690 --> 30:53.410]  So I had to sit down and do that one night.
[30:53.410 --> 30:54.250]  So guys, that one's coming.
[30:54.250 --> 30:56.010]  How to build your own irrigation system.
[30:56.010 --> 30:56.850]  They're sweet.
[30:56.850 --> 30:59.530]  I think that if you've got eight plants
[30:59.530 --> 31:01.890]  or 108 plants or 800 plants,
[31:01.890 --> 31:05.570]  I think an irrigation system could be very useful for you.
[31:05.570 --> 31:07.490]  Sometimes when I'm away, I'm like,
[31:07.490 --> 31:09.370]  oh God, I wanna just go home and check on the plants
[31:09.370 --> 31:10.210]  and see if they're dry.
[31:10.210 --> 31:11.210]  I just wanna go home and check on the plants
[31:11.210 --> 31:12.050]  and see if they're dry.
[31:12.050 --> 31:13.890]  Or when I had the larger grow,
[31:13.890 --> 31:16.730]  I just wanna, I would go to Denver for shows
[31:16.730 --> 31:18.690]  and on the way back, I would stop at the grow
[31:18.690 --> 31:19.530]  and check on the plants.
[31:19.530 --> 31:20.350]  Just to make sure.
[31:20.350 --> 31:21.190]  That's how CDI was.
[31:21.190 --> 31:23.090]  Yeah, cause some shit can go wrong sometimes.
[31:23.090 --> 31:23.910]  It will clog.
[31:23.910 --> 31:26.490]  Eventually your watering system is going to clog up.
[31:26.490 --> 31:27.430]  You're gonna have to mess with it.
[31:27.430 --> 31:29.050]  But we'll talk about building one of those.
[31:29.050 --> 31:29.890]  It's very useful.
[31:29.890 --> 31:31.290]  No matter how many plants you're running.
[31:31.610 --> 31:33.090]  It can definitely save you a bunch of time.
[31:33.090 --> 31:33.930]  Yeah, that's for sure.
[31:33.930 --> 31:36.090]  Especially if you don't have a lot of room to walk in.
[31:36.090 --> 31:37.450]  If you wanna blow out a room.
[31:37.450 --> 31:39.170]  Dude, I'm six foot five.
[31:39.170 --> 31:41.810]  And in a residential grow, lights hang at about,
[31:41.810 --> 31:44.410]  I don't know, probably they're about six foot down.
[31:44.410 --> 31:46.770]  So I'm walking through stuff sometimes.
[31:46.770 --> 31:48.650]  I'd leave people like, what's with the walkway?
[31:48.650 --> 31:49.610]  You're not growing cement.
[31:49.610 --> 31:51.570]  And I'm like, bro, look, be as big as me.
[31:51.570 --> 31:52.410]  Like, come on.
[31:52.410 --> 31:54.450]  And then I put my dreads in a giant bun
[31:54.450 --> 31:57.210]  and now I'm like seven feet tall at that point.
[31:57.210 --> 31:59.770]  Yeah, I'm fun in a grow room.
[31:59.770 --> 32:00.610]  That's awesome.
[32:00.930 --> 32:01.890]  I'm not too baggy of clothes
[32:01.890 --> 32:03.970]  because I get hung up on everything.
[32:03.970 --> 32:04.810]  Yeah.
[32:04.810 --> 32:05.650]  Fun stuff.
[32:05.650 --> 32:07.570]  I wish I could shrink up a little bit sometimes.
[32:07.570 --> 32:11.250]  No, I'm glad to be this gigantic Wook-like.
[32:11.250 --> 32:12.210]  Yeah.
[32:12.210 --> 32:14.290]  All right, you shouted out Frosty.
[32:14.290 --> 32:15.730]  Frosty, we wanna get you on the show, dude.
[32:15.730 --> 32:17.630]  Let's do some no-till stuff.
[32:17.630 --> 32:19.090]  Let's do some no-till stuff.
[32:19.090 --> 32:19.930]  Yeah.
[32:19.930 --> 32:20.750]  All right, so we've talked about your work.
[32:20.750 --> 32:21.590]  We talked about you moving.
[32:21.590 --> 32:22.410]  Dude, I'm glad you came out here
[32:22.410 --> 32:23.250]  because we made good friends.
[32:23.250 --> 32:24.650]  Yeah, I'm glad I came out here too.
[32:24.650 --> 32:26.970]  We both got kind of blondish,
[32:26.970 --> 32:28.850]  almost slightly gingery reddish hair.
[32:28.890 --> 32:30.610]  Big freaking Viking beers.
[32:30.610 --> 32:31.970]  We both showed up barefoot.
[32:31.970 --> 32:32.810]  Yep.
[32:32.810 --> 32:33.650]  It was fucking awesome.
[32:33.650 --> 32:34.470]  It's how you do it.
[32:34.470 --> 32:35.410]  We made good friends, made great friends.
[32:35.410 --> 32:36.770]  Since you're on a microphone, dude,
[32:36.770 --> 32:37.850]  and you got free reign of the world,
[32:37.850 --> 32:39.490]  let's talk about what you're gonna do next, bro.
[32:39.490 --> 32:41.570]  You got any huge plans for the world?
[32:41.570 --> 32:43.050]  I did.
[32:43.050 --> 32:45.970]  Me and a buddy of mine just bought some property
[32:45.970 --> 32:50.970]  down south, about five acres of land in Costilla County.
[32:52.490 --> 32:53.690]  Filling out some permits and stuff right now.
[32:53.690 --> 32:54.970]  We'll see where it takes us.
[32:54.970 --> 32:56.490]  We're just getting some stuff done out there.
[32:56.490 --> 32:57.650]  Little barefoot farms?
[32:57.650 --> 32:59.770]  Yeah, we're hoping to get a little barefoot ranch,
[32:59.770 --> 33:01.250]  barefoot farms, get a couple hoop houses.
[33:01.250 --> 33:02.650]  There's something going on out there.
[33:02.650 --> 33:03.490]  It'd be pretty awesome.
[33:03.490 --> 33:07.490]  Yeah, yeah, it's a pretty prime little plot of land
[33:07.490 --> 33:08.330]  to do it on.
[33:08.330 --> 33:10.770]  Pretty soon you'll be opening up some coffee shops.
[33:10.770 --> 33:11.610]  Yeah.
[33:11.610 --> 33:13.450]  Or a bowling alley.
[33:13.450 --> 33:14.290]  Or a bowling alley.
[33:14.290 --> 33:16.730]  This is kind of some inside jokes between us.
[33:16.730 --> 33:17.570]  Some funny shit.
[33:17.570 --> 33:19.290]  Yeah, you guys, get some coffee shops, bro.
[33:19.290 --> 33:20.330]  It's always a good investment.
[33:20.330 --> 33:21.150]  That's my advice.
[33:21.150 --> 33:22.690]  Invest in coffee shops.
[33:22.690 --> 33:23.690]  That's just random stuff.
[33:23.690 --> 33:24.970]  No, don't invest in coffee shops
[33:24.970 --> 33:26.690]  and then be mad when you don't make the money
[33:26.690 --> 33:28.090]  that you thought you were gonna make.
[33:28.090 --> 33:31.070]  Just kind of being facetious, I think, is the word.
[33:31.070 --> 33:32.490]  All right, bro, we've been going for like 30 minutes.
[33:32.490 --> 33:35.250]  Most of my listeners kind of dip out around 36 minutes.
[33:35.250 --> 33:37.730]  So, man, thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[33:37.730 --> 33:38.570]  Yeah, no problem, man.
[33:38.570 --> 33:39.390]  I'm glad you had me.
[33:39.390 --> 33:40.230]  Man, it was a good time.
[33:40.230 --> 33:41.070]  We're gonna take some dabs here.
[33:41.070 --> 33:43.490]  I've got some, you guys are gonna laugh at me.
[33:43.490 --> 33:47.130]  I've got some Blue Dream Shatter that is pretty damn good.
[33:47.130 --> 33:49.810]  I think we just dabbed the last of the Blue Dream Shatter.
[33:49.810 --> 33:51.050]  Yeah, we just took the last couple dabs
[33:51.050 --> 33:52.730]  of Blue Dream Shatter and it made us chatty.
[33:52.730 --> 33:53.570]  It did.
[33:53.570 --> 33:54.410]  And it made us have a great podcast.
[33:54.410 --> 33:56.530]  So shout out to the Blue Dream Shatter.
[33:57.370 --> 33:58.210]  That's really funny, because if you know me,

[34:00.890 --> 34:01.730]  Fuck Blue Dream.
[34:01.730 --> 34:02.730]  I don't wanna grow Blue Dream.
[34:02.730 --> 34:04.250]  I don't wanna smoke Blue Dream flowers.
[34:04.250 --> 34:05.950]  I don't wanna see Blue Dream at the dispensary.
[34:05.950 --> 34:07.290]  But that somebody was like,
