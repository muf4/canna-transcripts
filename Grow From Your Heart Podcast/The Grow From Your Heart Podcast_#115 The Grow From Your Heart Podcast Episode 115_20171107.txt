[00:17.920 --> 00:20.260]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[00:20.260 --> 00:22.000]  It's time for episode number 115
[00:22.000 --> 00:23.860]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.860 --> 00:27.060]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:28.060 --> 00:29.100]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:29.100 --> 00:30.300]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.300 --> 00:32.300]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:32.300 --> 00:33.540]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:33.540 --> 00:34.780]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.780 --> 00:36.500]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.500 --> 00:38.800]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:40.700 --> 00:42.220]  I'm your host, my friends, call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:42.220 --> 00:44.320]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:44.320 --> 00:46.180]  Starting the show off, trying not to cough already.
[00:46.180 --> 00:47.340]  Big shout out to Hitman Glass
[00:47.340 --> 00:49.480]  for helping us with the coughs over here.
[00:49.480 --> 00:51.440]  As always, guys, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:51.440 --> 00:53.340]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:53.340 --> 00:54.780]  for letting me use their music on my show.
[00:54.780 --> 00:58.580]  Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:58.580 --> 00:59.620]  Hope you guys are all having a great day.
[00:59.620 --> 01:00.860]  Hope you got a fat joint rolled up.
[01:00.860 --> 01:01.900]  I hope you got the e-mail on.
[01:01.900 --> 01:03.220]  I hope you got a dab out.
[01:03.220 --> 01:05.360]  Maybe you got the vaporizer going.
[01:05.360 --> 01:06.200]  What else?
[01:06.200 --> 01:07.020]  Maybe you got some edibles.
[01:07.020 --> 01:07.860]  Maybe you're smoking a blunt.
[01:07.860 --> 01:09.580]  Maybe you're in the hood getting down on a blunt.
[01:09.580 --> 01:11.000]  Across from me is my good friend Carlos.
[01:11.000 --> 01:11.840]  Thanks for joining me, Carlos.
[01:11.840 --> 01:12.660]  How you doing, man?
[01:12.660 --> 01:13.500]  Pretty good, you?
[01:13.500 --> 01:14.540]  I'm doing great, bro.
[01:14.540 --> 01:16.260]  To my left over here is my buddy, Alan.
[01:16.260 --> 01:17.100]  How are you, man?
[01:17.100 --> 01:18.220]  Great, great to be here.
[01:18.220 --> 01:19.660]  I'm gonna start the show off with a question.
[01:19.660 --> 01:22.060]  What is your favorite way to consume cannabis, Alan?
[01:22.060 --> 01:23.180]  I still like an old joint.
[01:23.180 --> 01:24.020]  Like an old joint?
[01:24.020 --> 01:25.100]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:25.100 --> 01:26.220]  All right, good and simple.
[01:26.220 --> 01:27.260]  How about you, Carlos?
[01:27.260 --> 01:31.340]  I like to dab an old joint.
[01:31.340 --> 01:32.420]  An old joint, but you like to dab.
[01:32.420 --> 01:33.260]  I'm torn, I'm torn.
[01:33.260 --> 01:34.820]  Okay, no, that's fair, that's fair.
[01:34.820 --> 01:37.020]  I started off loving an old school bong hit.
[01:37.020 --> 01:37.860]  Remember back in the day?
[01:37.860 --> 01:38.700]  I do remember that.
[01:38.700 --> 01:40.740]  I do, the most gigantic bong hits.
[01:40.740 --> 01:41.560]  Yeah.
[01:41.560 --> 01:42.400]  I remember, in fact.
[01:42.400 --> 01:43.240]  Yeah, I had the bong in the car.
[01:43.240 --> 01:44.660]  Like, yeah, I used to be the bong guy.
[01:44.660 --> 01:45.500]  And now everybody knows me.
[01:45.940 --> 01:48.860]  I remember back when you were doing the bong
[01:48.860 --> 01:51.860]  with the hot plate and the dabs onto the bong, dude.
[01:51.860 --> 01:52.700]  Oh, the skillet.
[01:52.700 --> 01:54.300]  Way back in the day.
[01:54.300 --> 01:56.740]  Shout out to Big D from Broadway Wellness
[01:56.740 --> 01:59.980]  who sold me my very first real dab rig.
[01:59.980 --> 02:01.780]  It was the first cannabis cup
[02:01.780 --> 02:04.460]  when I first got that old, the dub tube
[02:04.460 --> 02:05.900]  with the little swing arm skillet on it.
[02:05.900 --> 02:06.740]  Oh, shit, yeah.
[02:06.740 --> 02:09.620]  So yeah, I evolved quickly from bongs right into the hash.
[02:09.620 --> 02:11.100]  And I like to take like half gram dabs
[02:11.100 --> 02:12.660]  out of a nice Hitman rig,
[02:12.660 --> 02:15.060]  which that's a good way to work into this advertising here.
[02:15.100 --> 02:16.300]  Shout out to my friends at Hitman Glass.
[02:16.300 --> 02:17.140]  When I like to buy a new rig,
[02:17.140 --> 02:19.220]  I like to shop in an American store
[02:19.220 --> 02:20.260]  and buy an American product.
[02:20.260 --> 02:22.280]  I like to buy a rig made by an American person,
[02:22.280 --> 02:24.420]  not a Chinese kid with no protective eyewear.
[02:24.420 --> 02:26.140]  Chinese kid not getting paid a real wage.
[02:26.140 --> 02:28.740]  I want something made in America by an American.
[02:28.740 --> 02:30.140]  Hitman rigs are made by dabbers.
[02:30.140 --> 02:31.420]  These guys dab as hard as you do.
[02:31.420 --> 02:33.540]  Big shout out to my buddy, Dougie at Hitman Glass.
[02:33.540 --> 02:35.700]  Make sure you follow at Hitman Glass Dougie on Instagram
[02:35.700 --> 02:40.460]  and also visit www.hitmanglass.com.
[02:40.460 --> 02:41.300]  Check it out, you guys.
[02:41.300 --> 02:42.120]  Hitman is a great company.
[02:42.120 --> 02:42.960]  I support them.
[02:42.960 --> 02:44.620]  Also, you should check out the Chalice Festival
[02:45.180 --> 02:46.020]  if you're gonna be in California this summer,
[02:46.020 --> 02:47.220]  the Chalice Festival.
[02:47.220 --> 02:48.140]  What is the slogan there?
[02:48.140 --> 02:49.820]  Hash, music, and art.
[02:49.820 --> 02:50.740]  What could be better?
[02:50.740 --> 02:51.860]  Hash, music, and art, right?
[02:51.860 --> 02:53.040]  You guys wanna go to the Chalice Festival
[02:53.040 --> 02:53.880]  with me in California?
[02:53.880 --> 02:55.980]  It's over the 7-10 weekend.
[02:55.980 --> 02:58.140]  So let's go out to California and get down at Chalice.
[02:58.140 --> 02:59.160]  I'm trying to get out there this year.
[02:59.160 --> 03:02.660]  You never know what could happen in Rastajef's world.
[03:02.660 --> 03:04.740]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my friend, Rob,
[03:04.740 --> 03:05.880]  from the Sour Seed Company.
[03:05.880 --> 03:07.620]  Rob, I hope you're doing better, bro.
[03:07.620 --> 03:08.740]  Rob had a health scare.
[03:08.740 --> 03:10.820]  He was supposed to be on the show tonight.
[03:10.820 --> 03:12.640]  We will get him back in the very near future.
[03:12.640 --> 03:13.980]  Rob, take good care of yourself, brother.
[03:14.340 --> 03:15.420]  Much love from everybody at the table.
[03:15.420 --> 03:16.940]  Much love from the whole iRee Genetics
[03:16.940 --> 03:18.300]  and Grow From Your Heart.
[03:18.300 --> 03:19.780]  The whole team, the whole crew.
[03:19.780 --> 03:20.600]  Dude, get better, man.
[03:20.600 --> 03:21.440]  That's scary.
[03:21.440 --> 03:22.260]  You told me that shit.
[03:22.260 --> 03:23.420]  I'm sincerely worried.
[03:23.420 --> 03:24.540]  Take care of yourself.
[03:24.540 --> 03:26.300]  Yeah, man, we second that.
[03:26.300 --> 03:27.860]  Yeah, everybody here has got this somber look
[03:27.860 --> 03:28.700]  on their face now.
[03:28.700 --> 03:29.900]  We went from having fun and taking dabs
[03:29.900 --> 03:31.300]  to, oh, shit, what's wrong with Rob?
[03:31.300 --> 03:33.540]  Yeah, it's all your fault, Rob.
[03:33.540 --> 03:34.380]  We love you, Rob.
[03:34.380 --> 03:35.340]  Get well.
[03:35.340 --> 03:36.980]  So we kind of put together an impromptu show.
[03:36.980 --> 03:37.820]  I called my friends over.
[03:37.820 --> 03:38.780]  I was like, dude, my guest bailed.
[03:38.780 --> 03:40.020]  Come on, help me out with the podcast.
[03:40.020 --> 03:41.580]  So we got Carlos, we got Alan here.
[03:41.580 --> 03:43.180]  We're gonna talk about a few random things.
[03:43.180 --> 03:44.380]  Before I get there, I have to let you guys know
[03:44.380 --> 03:46.140]  the stickers from the hashtag,
[03:46.140 --> 03:48.820]  I like it when you ramble Twitter campaign,
[03:48.820 --> 03:49.660]  whatever that was called.
[03:49.660 --> 03:51.380]  Those stickers should have landed at your door.
[03:51.380 --> 03:53.580]  If you participated in that, check your mail.
[03:53.580 --> 03:54.940]  You should have some stickers.
[03:54.940 --> 03:57.180]  I've got an email I wanna read.
[03:57.180 --> 03:59.020]  It's right here.
[03:59.020 --> 04:00.460]  I'm prepared, you guys, I promise.
[04:00.460 --> 04:01.300]  Somebody sent me an email.
[04:01.300 --> 04:03.380]  It says, hey now, just wanted to drop a note
[04:03.380 --> 04:05.700]  and say how much I loved episode 112
[04:05.700 --> 04:07.260]  or how I got into the business.
[04:07.260 --> 04:08.520]  Awesome, great story.
[04:08.560 --> 04:12.000]  Looking forward to the Grow Focused shows.
[04:12.000 --> 04:13.360]  This guy also says he's waiting to hear
[04:13.360 --> 04:15.240]  if he gets hired for a job in Illinois.
[04:15.240 --> 04:18.720]  So dude, I really wish you good luck on the job in Illinois.
[04:18.720 --> 04:19.800]  And man, thanks for listening
[04:19.800 --> 04:22.440]  and thanks for the kind words about episode 112.
[04:22.440 --> 04:24.320]  I really like hearing from the listeners.
[04:24.320 --> 04:26.760]  It makes all the effort I put into this show super worth it.
[04:26.760 --> 04:28.440]  All you guys gotta do is say thank you.
[04:28.440 --> 04:29.520]  I really appreciate it.
[04:29.520 --> 04:31.080]  If you've got an email you'd like to send to me,
[04:31.080 --> 04:33.120]  it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[04:33.120 --> 04:33.960]  I'd love to hear from you.
[04:33.960 --> 04:37.360]  You can also find me on Twitter, it's at GFYHpodcast.
[04:37.400 --> 04:39.000]  Since I'm telling you about the email,
[04:39.000 --> 04:40.800]  the last episode was all about CBD.
[04:40.800 --> 04:42.720]  We had our friend Fox from Foxtracks come on
[04:42.720 --> 04:43.680]  to talk about CBD.
[04:43.680 --> 04:46.720]  A friend of mine told me that that episode made her cry.
[04:46.720 --> 04:48.840]  I'm sorry and you're welcome.
[04:48.840 --> 04:51.440]  If it's making you cry, we're doing something right, right?
[04:51.440 --> 04:54.600]  Yeah, so if you've got questions from the CBD episode,
[04:54.600 --> 04:57.000]  I encourage you to email me those questions
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.960]  and I will get Fox back on the show
[04:58.960 --> 05:02.160]  and we will do round two of CBD.
[05:02.160 --> 05:05.360]  All right, so our first topic that I wanted to bring up
[05:05.360 --> 05:07.040]  on social media lately,
[05:07.720 --> 05:08.640]  there have been a lot of crazy pictures.
[05:08.640 --> 05:11.880]  Have you guys seen the picture of the super clear shatter
[05:11.880 --> 05:12.720]  that that guy posted?
[05:12.720 --> 05:13.540]  I have, man.
[05:13.540 --> 05:15.880]  I seen that picture of a super clear shatter.
[05:15.880 --> 05:17.480]  Turn your face toward the mic a little more, please.
[05:17.480 --> 05:18.320]  Or, yeah, there you go.
[05:18.320 --> 05:19.140]  Sorry about that.
[05:19.140 --> 05:19.980]  I just wanna get you in there.
[05:19.980 --> 05:20.800]  Yeah, you see how good you sound?
[05:20.800 --> 05:21.640]  Yeah, much better now.
[05:21.640 --> 05:22.480]  You got that awesome voice.
[05:22.480 --> 05:23.300]  Much better.
[05:23.300 --> 05:24.140]  Yeah.
[05:24.140 --> 05:26.160]  Yeah, I saw that picture that was going around
[05:26.160 --> 05:29.480]  on Facebook of the super clear shatter.
[05:29.480 --> 05:31.280]  That was just, I couldn't even believe that
[05:31.280 --> 05:32.120]  right off the bat.
[05:32.120 --> 05:33.520]  So I know exactly how they did it.
[05:33.520 --> 05:34.720]  Do you want me to tell you how they did it?
[05:34.720 --> 05:35.800]  Let's hear it.
[05:35.800 --> 05:40.440]  So they put, so actually nature put a puddle of water
[05:40.440 --> 05:41.840]  on the hood of somebody's car,
[05:41.840 --> 05:43.140]  and then it got really cold outside,
[05:43.140 --> 05:44.600]  and they picked it up and they carried it inside
[05:44.600 --> 05:47.120]  and held it in front of a vac oven with gloves on.
[05:47.120 --> 05:50.020]  It took a picture of it and posted it to the social media.
[05:50.020 --> 05:52.060]  And that's just a piece of ice.
[05:52.060 --> 05:55.100]  Everybody, when they saw the vac oven and the rubber gloves,
[05:55.100 --> 05:56.440]  everybody on social media just went,
[05:56.440 --> 05:58.160]  oh shit, look at this hash.
[05:58.160 --> 05:59.320]  That's fucking ice.
[05:59.320 --> 06:00.920]  It's ice hash is all that is.
[06:00.920 --> 06:03.320]  I saw that right off the bat too.
[06:03.320 --> 06:05.120]  I thought there's no way that's possible.
[06:05.160 --> 06:06.560]  They let that ride for a few days,
[06:06.560 --> 06:07.640]  but then they went and they're like,
[06:07.640 --> 06:09.640]  hey everybody, it's just ice.
[06:09.640 --> 06:11.340]  So shout out for fooling everybody.
[06:11.340 --> 06:12.600]  I should have pulled up the Twitter account,
[06:12.600 --> 06:13.640]  the Instagram account.
[06:13.640 --> 06:14.680]  Yeah, hashtag hoax.
[06:14.680 --> 06:16.840]  So if you guys were blown away by that super clear hash
[06:16.840 --> 06:18.880]  that was held up a few days ago on Instagram,
[06:18.880 --> 06:20.560]  a lot of people were reposting it.
[06:20.560 --> 06:21.400]  It was all over Facebook.
[06:21.400 --> 06:22.880]  It was all over the social media.
[06:22.880 --> 06:24.200]  That was frozen water.
[06:24.200 --> 06:25.520]  You can make hash that clear.
[06:25.520 --> 06:26.360]  It's easy.
[06:26.360 --> 06:28.080]  You're doing it in the freezer right now probably.
[06:28.080 --> 06:29.320]  If you live in the right part of the country,
[06:29.320 --> 06:31.120]  it's happening in your backyard right now somewhere.
[06:31.120 --> 06:32.440]  You could do it in Pueblo tonight.
[06:32.440 --> 06:34.200]  Yeah, it's going on right here in our neighborhood.
[06:34.200 --> 06:35.760]  So sorry to burst everybody's bubble.
[06:35.760 --> 06:38.180]  That was just a piece of ice.
[06:38.180 --> 06:39.480]  So another social media thing
[06:39.480 --> 06:43.080]  that has been really catching a lot of attention lately,
[06:43.080 --> 06:46.400]  there was a glass convention in Las Vegas just recently.
[06:46.400 --> 06:47.220]  Was it in Vegas?
[06:47.220 --> 06:48.060]  I'm pretty sure that was Vegas.
[06:48.060 --> 06:50.080]  Anyway, there's a glass convention,
[06:50.080 --> 06:53.680]  an industry convention where a mothership rig,
[06:53.680 --> 06:57.420]  a Sagan and Scott Deppie collab sold.
[06:57.420 --> 06:58.560]  You guys, I want you to sit down
[06:58.560 --> 07:00.900]  before I tell you how much this rig sold for.
[07:00.900 --> 07:02.560]  If you're driving, you might want to pull over.
[07:02.560 --> 07:04.840]  If you're at work, put down your knife.
[07:04.840 --> 07:09.840]  Somebody bought a hash rig for $101,000, you guys.
[07:11.200 --> 07:12.520]  I can't even believe that.
[07:12.520 --> 07:14.320]  It's certainly overpaid by a grand.
[07:14.320 --> 07:15.160]  That is.
[07:17.160 --> 07:18.240]  That was an auction style.
[07:18.240 --> 07:20.280]  So the other guy was like 100 Gs
[07:20.280 --> 07:22.960]  and this guy's like 101 and they gave it to him for that.
[07:22.960 --> 07:24.080]  Yeah, it's insane.
[07:24.080 --> 07:26.320]  That's a lot of money for a hash rig.
[07:26.320 --> 07:27.920]  How much hash do you have if you're gonna,
[07:27.920 --> 07:30.600]  you better be smoking the best hash ever.
[07:30.600 --> 07:31.480]  And a lot of it.
[07:31.480 --> 07:32.320]  A lot of it, all day long.
[07:33.080 --> 07:34.280]  Actually, if I remember correctly,
[07:34.280 --> 07:35.120]  when I was looking at it,
[07:35.120 --> 07:39.560]  did it have a flower bowl set up right up on it right away?
[07:39.560 --> 07:42.040]  That was actually a mothership honey bucket.
[07:42.040 --> 07:43.320]  That's why it looks like a big bowl,
[07:43.320 --> 07:45.960]  but the skillet swings in and out of there.
[07:45.960 --> 07:48.800]  So it does look like a big fat bowl.
[07:48.800 --> 07:50.040]  Oh, I like that you said that.
[07:50.040 --> 07:51.520]  Okay, let's open up that floodgate.
[07:51.520 --> 07:53.160]  I'm gonna say this on my podcast.
[07:53.160 --> 07:54.720]  About 5,000 people are gonna listen to this
[07:54.720 --> 07:56.040]  and I'm sure at least 100 of them
[07:56.040 --> 07:57.080]  are gonna send me dirty emails.
[07:57.080 --> 07:59.080]  That rig is fucking ugly.
[08:00.040 --> 08:02.320]  $101,000 for a really ugly rig.
[08:02.320 --> 08:05.680]  I'm no, you know, I'm a connoisseur of many other things
[08:05.680 --> 08:07.760]  as it comes to weed and flowers,
[08:07.760 --> 08:08.920]  connoisseur of oil and all that,
[08:08.920 --> 08:13.920]  but that rig was, man, it was all over the place.
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.800]  It looked like, so it's got a gaudy ass base.
[08:17.800 --> 08:20.240]  The base is this, so one thing I should mention,
[08:20.240 --> 08:21.720]  this rig is covered in moons
[08:21.720 --> 08:23.560]  and if you turn the rig around slowly,
[08:23.560 --> 08:25.440]  it goes through the phases of the moon
[08:25.440 --> 08:26.840]  is something that Deppie pointed out.
[08:26.840 --> 08:28.560]  Scott Deppie, shout out to Scott Deppie
[08:29.080 --> 08:30.000]  and to Sagan Glass.
[08:30.000 --> 08:30.840]  It's great work, you guys.
[08:30.840 --> 08:31.660]  I just think it's ugly.
[08:31.660 --> 08:32.600]  It's my personal preference.
[08:32.600 --> 08:33.860]  Obviously enough people love it,
[08:33.860 --> 08:35.480]  so don't be mad at me for thinking it's ugly.
[08:35.480 --> 08:37.640]  A lot of people, somebody paid $101,000,
[08:37.640 --> 08:38.720]  so it's obviously not ugly.
[08:38.720 --> 08:40.040]  One person loved a lot.
[08:40.040 --> 08:43.400]  Loved the shit out of it, way more than I hated it.
[08:43.400 --> 08:45.960]  He loves it 101,000 times more than I dislike it.
[08:45.960 --> 08:48.260]  I just think it's ugly, but it's poorly planned.
[08:48.260 --> 08:50.280]  The base is god awful ugly.
[08:50.280 --> 08:52.560]  It's got moons glued to it on the base.
[08:52.560 --> 08:53.760]  It's in this odd shape.
[08:53.760 --> 08:55.840]  It looks like the base was just,
[08:55.840 --> 08:57.080]  they made the top and they're like,
[08:57.120 --> 08:58.880]  well, we need something big enough to hold this up now.
[08:58.880 --> 09:02.320]  So they made that gaudy base and then they put a,
[09:02.320 --> 09:04.100]  I think the color would be called Stardust,
[09:04.100 --> 09:06.240]  black Stardust Faberge egg.
[09:06.240 --> 09:07.600]  And if you guys know anything about glass,
[09:07.600 --> 09:09.120]  the Fab egg is the artwork.
[09:09.120 --> 09:10.340]  It's the way to go,
[09:10.340 --> 09:11.720]  but they made it out of a color of glass
[09:11.720 --> 09:12.560]  you can't see through,
[09:12.560 --> 09:14.080]  so you could barely tell that it's a Fab egg.
[09:14.080 --> 09:15.560]  It looks like a grenade.
[09:15.560 --> 09:17.080]  That's exactly what it looks like actually.
[09:17.080 --> 09:18.000]  Okay.
[09:18.000 --> 09:18.960]  Is there any way you can pull up a picture?
[09:18.960 --> 09:19.800]  Yeah, I've got a picture.
[09:19.800 --> 09:20.640]  I didn't see it.
[09:20.640 --> 09:22.480]  I've got a picture here on my phone somewhere.
[09:22.480 --> 09:23.840]  I posted it up to social media,
[09:23.840 --> 09:25.400]  so it shouldn't be too hard to find,
[09:25.400 --> 09:27.680]  but we will pull this up for you to take a look at,
[09:27.680 --> 09:29.240]  but it looks like poorly planned.
[09:29.240 --> 09:31.720]  And then it looks like they just glued moons around it
[09:31.720 --> 09:34.160]  to give it the moon vibe that they were looking for.
[09:34.160 --> 09:35.640]  And I said that I wanted to buy it
[09:35.640 --> 09:37.360]  and just glue a rocket to it
[09:37.360 --> 09:39.920]  just to complete the whole space theme.
[09:39.920 --> 09:40.760]  All right, I found the,
[09:40.760 --> 09:42.760]  oh, look, there was the image right away.
[09:42.760 --> 09:44.040]  It's taking me a minute to find the image
[09:44.040 --> 09:45.720]  because Facebook likes to do that thing
[09:45.720 --> 09:46.820]  where it jumps around.
[09:47.760 --> 09:48.720]  I'm pulling it up, I promise.
[09:48.720 --> 09:49.600]  Here we go.
[09:49.600 --> 09:52.600]  This is a rig that somebody paid $101,000 for.
[09:52.600 --> 09:53.440]  That's insane.
[09:53.440 --> 09:54.280]  Yeah, it's beautiful.
[09:54.280 --> 09:55.400]  It's got some great colors to it,
[09:55.400 --> 09:57.360]  but it looks like something that Les Claypool
[09:57.360 --> 09:59.920]  or Tim Burton would have put together, in my opinion.
[09:59.920 --> 10:00.760]  That's a very good, I like that.
[10:00.760 --> 10:03.560]  And Mothership is known for a really clean,
[10:03.560 --> 10:06.520]  sleek, smooth, tight baller status.
[10:06.520 --> 10:08.440]  Look, their rigs are gorgeous and clean
[10:08.440 --> 10:09.720]  and perfect and flawless.
[10:09.720 --> 10:10.560]  And this thing looks-
[10:10.560 --> 10:11.600]  This doesn't come close.
[10:11.600 --> 10:14.120]  Yeah, and you're seeing, I like that.
[10:14.120 --> 10:16.040]  Alan's not really into the glass scene.
[10:16.040 --> 10:18.080]  He doesn't, he hasn't mentioned anything about glass
[10:18.080 --> 10:19.040]  in the time that I've known him.
[10:19.040 --> 10:19.880]  He's out of the loop there.
[10:19.880 --> 10:21.080]  I mean, it looks cool, but-
[10:21.080 --> 10:22.320]  And he just doesn't, he already knows
[10:22.360 --> 10:25.240]  that that doesn't fit the Mothership motto.
[10:25.240 --> 10:26.600]  Mothership, I'll give you guys a shout out though.
[10:26.600 --> 10:30.720]  Those new race car themed rigs are the bee's knees, bro.
[10:30.720 --> 10:33.280]  There are a couple of those that I really, really love.
[10:33.280 --> 10:35.200]  I feel like I'm doing too much pulling up stuff
[10:35.200 --> 10:36.520]  on the phone here, but I'll show you guys
[10:36.520 --> 10:38.600]  these race car rigs because they are beautiful.
[10:38.600 --> 10:41.300]  And I can do editing if any of this gets carried away.
[10:42.280 --> 10:44.280]  Hit man, or Mothership.
[10:46.600 --> 10:48.360]  These rigs, I'm gonna try to describe it now
[10:48.360 --> 10:49.880]  since I'm pulling it up.
[10:49.880 --> 10:54.400]  So they took a normal Taurus rig, which would be clear.
[10:54.400 --> 10:58.120]  And they have used yellow glass on one portion
[10:58.120 --> 10:59.480]  and blue glass on another.
[10:59.480 --> 11:01.720]  And it looks really sleek and it's super smooth.
[11:01.720 --> 11:03.480]  And they call it the race car series.
[11:03.480 --> 11:06.180]  This is a Klein and where the Klein function happens,
[11:06.180 --> 11:08.040]  they used clear glass to make a window
[11:08.040 --> 11:09.840]  so that you can see the water bubble in there.
[11:09.840 --> 11:11.280]  That is actually pretty cool.
[11:11.280 --> 11:13.220]  Yeah, I really love the race car series.
[11:13.220 --> 11:14.060]  Check that one out.
[11:14.060 --> 11:14.880]  That is very cool.
[11:14.880 --> 11:15.760]  Yeah, so shout out to Mothership glass.
[11:15.760 --> 11:17.460]  I do not like that expensive piece,
[11:17.460 --> 11:19.600]  but I really love the race car series.
[11:20.320 --> 11:22.320]  So I apologize for bashing with the clear window.
[11:22.320 --> 11:23.160]  It looks good, doesn't it?
[11:23.160 --> 11:23.980]  It's dope.
[11:23.980 --> 11:24.820]  That is very good.
[11:24.820 --> 11:25.840]  It's just a tight look.
[11:25.840 --> 11:29.000]  Is that rig levitating in that picture?
[11:29.000 --> 11:29.840]  It seems.
[11:29.840 --> 11:30.680]  Rig is levitating, right?
[11:30.680 --> 11:31.500]  It seems that way.
[11:31.500 --> 11:32.920]  I wondered if I was the only one that noticed that.
[11:32.920 --> 11:34.040]  Shout out to Mothership.
[11:34.040 --> 11:35.680]  I don't know how you made that happen.
[11:35.680 --> 11:37.480]  I should probably stop talking about Mothership
[11:37.480 --> 11:39.720]  since I'm sponsored by Hitman Glass.
[11:39.720 --> 11:41.040]  Buy yourself a Hitman rig.
[11:42.200 --> 11:43.560]  All right, so we all agree
[11:43.560 --> 11:46.120]  that that rig was way overpriced, right?
[11:46.120 --> 11:46.960]  Yeah, I agree.
[11:46.960 --> 11:48.560]  For me, it definitely was.
[11:48.560 --> 11:50.560]  I think everybody at this table does financially well.
[11:50.560 --> 11:53.280]  We're all kind of in the legal cannabis industry.
[11:53.280 --> 11:57.400]  What's the most money that you would find acceptable
[11:57.400 --> 12:00.520]  to pay cash for a rig at this point in your life?
[12:00.520 --> 12:02.480]  I'd pay a good 150 bucks for a good-
[12:02.480 --> 12:03.600]  Good 150?
[12:03.600 --> 12:04.440]  Okay.
[12:04.440 --> 12:05.260]  150 bucks.
[12:05.260 --> 12:06.100]  All right.
[12:06.100 --> 12:07.760]  You're gonna have to go to a trade show
[12:07.760 --> 12:08.640]  and pick up a Hitman
[12:08.640 --> 12:09.960]  because that's the only way you're gonna find one
[12:09.960 --> 12:10.800]  for that price.
[12:10.800 --> 12:11.920]  Oh, I know, I know.
[12:11.920 --> 12:13.320]  Everyone gives me shit all the time.
[12:13.320 --> 12:14.160]  That's all right.
[12:14.160 --> 12:15.480]  They're glass, they break.
[12:15.480 --> 12:16.360]  You smoke cash out of it.
[12:16.360 --> 12:17.200]  I understand.
[12:17.800 --> 12:18.840]  At 250, I think.
[12:18.840 --> 12:19.680]  You're gonna go 250?
[12:19.680 --> 12:20.560]  And you're not a dabber,
[12:20.560 --> 12:22.040]  so I'm guessing you're gonna buy a nice bong
[12:22.040 --> 12:23.960]  or a good pipe at that point.
[12:23.960 --> 12:25.720]  All right, then that's reasonable.
[12:25.720 --> 12:27.680]  Hey guys, I want you to send me a tweet
[12:27.680 --> 12:31.480]  to at GFYH podcast and tell me right now,
[12:31.480 --> 12:32.480]  if you're gonna buy a rig,
[12:32.480 --> 12:34.680]  what you would find to be a reasonable budget.
[12:34.680 --> 12:36.840]  Are you in the $101,000 range
[12:36.840 --> 12:39.640]  or are you over here like Carlos with the $150 rig?
[12:40.840 --> 12:43.560]  I'm using a Hitman E-Series sidecar in front of me.
[12:43.560 --> 12:47.000]  This one, so I bought this at Illusions Glass in Denver
[12:47.760 --> 12:50.000]  and this was a $550 rig at that point in time.
[12:51.680 --> 12:53.000]  I don't think it's worth that at this point,
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.640]  but it was at that time.
[12:54.640 --> 12:55.960]  In front of me here is the,
[12:55.960 --> 12:57.720]  shout out to Hitman Glass once again.
[12:57.720 --> 12:59.440]  I would put down 250 for that.
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.440]  This one on their website is 800 for the short stack.
[13:05.440 --> 13:07.280]  Yeah, guys, Hitman sent this to me.
[13:07.280 --> 13:08.320]  If I had the money, I would.
[13:08.320 --> 13:09.840]  Well, yeah, if you won that lottery.
[13:09.840 --> 13:11.400]  If you won the lottery, you'd buy two of those, right?
[13:11.400 --> 13:12.240]  I still have that ticket.
[13:12.240 --> 13:13.080]  And the Powerball.
[13:13.080 --> 13:15.600]  And I have to check out those numbers.
[13:16.440 --> 13:18.040]  I'm glad you came here and recorded a podcast
[13:18.040 --> 13:19.520]  before you checked out your Powerball numbers
[13:19.520 --> 13:22.160]  because if you won that, I would not have seen you tonight.
[13:22.160 --> 13:23.720]  You would be calling me from Costa Rica like,
[13:23.720 --> 13:26.600]  hey bro, can we reschedule that?
[13:26.600 --> 13:28.120]  Yeah, all right.
[13:28.120 --> 13:30.680]  So something that I wanted to talk about
[13:30.680 --> 13:32.160]  since everybody at the table
[13:32.160 --> 13:34.160]  is into the legal cannabis industry.
[13:35.360 --> 13:37.080]  You were kind of making,
[13:37.080 --> 13:38.000]  we should back up and talk about
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.600]  kind of how we ran into each other.
[13:39.600 --> 13:42.760]  I have known you since I was the bud tender at Metamar.
[13:42.760 --> 13:45.320]  It has been such a long time, but what were you?
[13:46.040 --> 13:47.520]  That was 2008 when we got closed.
[13:47.520 --> 13:49.680]  Yeah, you were one of our first patients
[13:49.680 --> 13:52.600]  that would come in and buy medicine from us.
[13:52.600 --> 13:54.000]  Yeah, when you came,
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.960]  did you come in when it was in the apartment upstairs?
[13:56.960 --> 13:57.800]  I did.
[13:57.800 --> 14:00.400]  Okay, so you got to see it evolve from that guy's couch.
[14:00.400 --> 14:02.120]  We don't talk about that guy's name on the show.
[14:02.120 --> 14:04.240]  We leave names out to protect the innocent.
[14:04.240 --> 14:06.120]  But we went from that guy's couch
[14:06.120 --> 14:07.280]  and then it went to the middle floor
[14:07.280 --> 14:09.600]  and then we moved it down to the main floor
[14:09.600 --> 14:13.160]  and then we busted it out and went hardcore for a while.
[14:13.160 --> 14:14.880]  Right, it has been such a long time.
[14:15.640 --> 14:18.880]  2008 is when that shop was really booming.
[14:18.880 --> 14:20.440]  2007, 2008.
[14:20.440 --> 14:22.720]  So yeah, 2008 is how long I've known this guy.
[14:22.720 --> 14:25.000]  So he used to shop at the dispensary
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.680]  that which Tom Sexton pretty much handed the keys to me
[14:27.680 --> 14:29.740]  and was like, here you go, run the shop.
[14:29.740 --> 14:32.840]  So since then we've both gotten into,
[14:32.840 --> 14:35.200]  that shop was legal, quasi legal.
[14:35.200 --> 14:36.040]  I don't know how legal that shop was.
[14:36.040 --> 14:37.400]  I don't know what you would call that.
[14:37.400 --> 14:38.800]  Yeah, it was such a gray area.
[14:38.800 --> 14:40.200]  We called it the wild, wild west.
[14:40.200 --> 14:42.120]  I was growing herb at the house
[14:42.120 --> 14:43.640]  and Tom was growing herb at the house
[14:43.640 --> 14:45.560]  and we would take it and put it on the shelves
[14:45.560 --> 14:48.800]  and then customers would show up with a backpack
[14:48.800 --> 14:49.800]  and you'd know.
[14:49.800 --> 14:51.420]  They'd be like, I just need to talk to Jeff
[14:51.420 --> 14:53.400]  and they'd send him back and they'd come talk to me
[14:53.400 --> 14:54.960]  and they'd be like, look at all this weed I grew.
[14:54.960 --> 14:55.880]  Do you guys wanna buy it?
[14:55.880 --> 14:57.220]  And so we'd just buy it if it was good enough
[14:57.220 --> 14:58.400]  and they wanted a reasonable price.
[14:58.400 --> 14:59.800]  We could buy the weed from them
[14:59.800 --> 15:01.200]  and put it on the shelves at that point.
[15:01.200 --> 15:02.160]  It's all. Good old days.
[15:02.160 --> 15:03.440]  The good old days, yeah.
[15:03.440 --> 15:04.520]  As you'd call them.
[15:04.520 --> 15:06.560]  I think the herb was a little bit better back then.
[15:06.560 --> 15:07.880]  Oh, I agree, most definitely.
[15:07.880 --> 15:09.560]  Yeah, boutique batches are much better
[15:09.560 --> 15:10.640]  than these large scale.
[15:10.640 --> 15:11.480]  At least, definitely.
[15:11.480 --> 15:12.680]  Yeah, and I work in a large scale, girl.
[15:12.840 --> 15:14.240]  It's a different type of thing.
[15:14.240 --> 15:15.800]  It's a totally different monster.
[15:15.800 --> 15:17.880]  The air flow is different, the temperature control is different.
[15:17.880 --> 15:19.480]  That's one of the things I've noticed about everything
[15:19.480 --> 15:21.760]  is the commercial grows are just, oh my God,
[15:21.760 --> 15:24.040]  they're just, it seems like I can't believe
[15:24.040 --> 15:27.080]  how weed back in the day was so much better
[15:27.080 --> 15:30.900]  and it was just people working with almost no budget
[15:30.900 --> 15:33.720]  compared to people who have millions, you know?
[15:33.720 --> 15:36.800]  I think, and a lot of that is because the passion,
[15:36.800 --> 15:38.940]  the industry evolved, the rules evolved
[15:38.940 --> 15:41.360]  to where only people with a million dollars
[15:41.400 --> 15:42.900]  can play in the cannabis game right now.
[15:42.900 --> 15:44.800]  You have to have a million dollars to get involved
[15:44.800 --> 15:47.540]  in the cannabis game, to have a legal shop and a grow,
[15:47.540 --> 15:50.040]  a grow that supports that shop to be able to open
[15:50.040 --> 15:53.120]  and have a clean environment to build your grow
[15:53.120 --> 15:55.600]  and a retail environment and to hire a staff
[15:55.600 --> 15:57.680]  and to get product and to get insurance
[15:57.680 --> 15:58.520]  and to get security.
[15:58.520 --> 16:00.320]  Security is so expensive to open.
[16:00.320 --> 16:02.280]  Any type of, anything,
[16:02.280 --> 16:04.500]  marijuana enforcement division regulated,
[16:04.500 --> 16:07.400]  every square foot where people can go
[16:07.400 --> 16:09.320]  needs to be covered by a camera.
[16:09.320 --> 16:11.040]  If there's a doorway, they want a camera
[16:11.720 --> 16:13.040]  on both sides of the door so that if they look
[16:13.040 --> 16:14.480]  at two camera views on the monitor,
[16:14.480 --> 16:15.680]  they can see you leave one room
[16:15.680 --> 16:17.680]  and enter the other room flawlessly.
[16:17.680 --> 16:20.440]  There can be no gaps in your travel on the cameras.
[16:20.440 --> 16:21.640]  So it costs you a million bucks
[16:21.640 --> 16:23.280]  to get into the industry nowadays.
[16:23.280 --> 16:26.440]  And what sucks about that is people like you and I,
[16:26.440 --> 16:28.400]  we have heart, we got mad heart, you know what I mean?
[16:28.400 --> 16:30.960]  We've been doing this since before we should even admit
[16:30.960 --> 16:32.120]  we were growing in our basements.
[16:32.120 --> 16:33.440]  We were getting it on.
[16:33.440 --> 16:35.700]  And so we've got heart.
[16:35.700 --> 16:37.440]  We don't have a million dollars because we had to hide.
[16:37.440 --> 16:38.640]  We had to, we were growing weed.
[16:38.640 --> 16:39.600]  We weren't going to college.
[16:39.600 --> 16:40.840]  We weren't running a car dealership.
[16:41.640 --> 16:42.740]  We weren't doing whatever these other guys are doing.
[16:42.740 --> 16:44.160]  So we had to make our own money.
[16:44.160 --> 16:47.840]  And now that we've got it, your headphones all right?
[16:47.840 --> 16:48.680]  Nope, I'll tap them.
[16:48.680 --> 16:49.680]  Not doing so good.
[16:49.680 --> 16:51.680]  All right, I'll tap them and they'll start working.
[16:51.680 --> 16:52.920]  No, maybe.
[16:52.920 --> 16:53.760]  I'll wiggle the cable.
[16:53.760 --> 16:54.600]  That's okay.
[16:54.600 --> 16:55.420]  You got a great voice, man.
[16:55.420 --> 16:56.260]  I can hear you over the headphones.
[16:56.260 --> 16:58.040]  All right, as long as you're comfortable.
[16:58.040 --> 16:58.880]  All right, we'll edit that part out.
[16:58.880 --> 16:59.720]  Not a problem.
[16:59.720 --> 17:00.540]  I'm good too.
[17:00.540 --> 17:01.380]  17 minutes in.
[17:01.380 --> 17:02.220]  You good?
[17:02.220 --> 17:03.040]  I'm good.
[17:03.040 --> 17:03.880]  You guys can hear me?
[17:03.880 --> 17:04.720]  Oh yeah, we can hear you.
[17:04.720 --> 17:05.540]  I think it's his headphones.
[17:05.540 --> 17:06.380]  Mine just went on.
[17:06.380 --> 17:07.220]  All right, guys.
[17:07.220 --> 17:10.320]  Don't ever buy the HA04 headphone amplifier
[17:10.720 --> 17:11.680]  from Livewire if you're at Guitar Center
[17:11.680 --> 17:12.760]  and they offer you that.
[17:12.760 --> 17:14.040]  Give them a dirty look and buy the one
[17:14.040 --> 17:15.400]  that's $20 more expensive.
[17:15.400 --> 17:16.900]  It'll be well worth your time, guys.
[17:16.900 --> 17:18.000]  That's my recommendation.
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.360]  All right, so we're talking about this industry.
[17:19.360 --> 17:20.440]  If you don't have a million dollars,
[17:20.440 --> 17:21.720]  you can't get into the cannabis industry.
[17:21.720 --> 17:24.240]  But Lowe's and I, Carlos and I have mad passion.
[17:24.240 --> 17:25.800]  We wouldn't be able to buy a shop right now
[17:25.800 --> 17:27.920]  and set that up because we've been growing weed
[17:27.920 --> 17:28.760]  and living like that.
[17:28.760 --> 17:30.360]  You gotta kind of hide when you're a cannabis grower
[17:30.360 --> 17:31.200]  back in the day.
[17:31.200 --> 17:32.480]  We couldn't have all the money that we had.
[17:32.480 --> 17:33.320]  So we had to hide that.
[17:33.320 --> 17:34.140]  We couldn't go open a store
[17:34.140 --> 17:34.980]  because we couldn't talk about,
[17:34.980 --> 17:35.820]  how'd you make this money?
[17:35.820 --> 17:36.640]  I grew weed.
[17:36.960 --> 17:38.920]  You had to kind of be on the down low.
[17:38.920 --> 17:40.880]  So the people that are able to open shops now
[17:40.880 --> 17:43.120]  are guys that have had other businesses
[17:43.120 --> 17:44.040]  that were doing other things.
[17:44.040 --> 17:45.240]  And no offense to those guys,
[17:45.240 --> 17:46.280]  but they don't have the heart
[17:46.280 --> 17:48.440]  that somebody like you and I have about the industry.
[17:48.440 --> 17:49.600]  We've been working.
[17:49.600 --> 17:50.440]  It's a business to them.
[17:50.440 --> 17:51.960]  If they have an accountant and a lawyer
[17:51.960 --> 17:53.560]  and then the master growers are the guys
[17:53.560 --> 17:54.720]  that are just supposed to go grow,
[17:54.720 --> 17:57.560]  they're employees, go grow that weed.
[17:57.560 --> 17:58.840]  I'm gonna point this at your face.
[17:58.840 --> 17:59.760]  There you go.
[17:59.760 --> 18:01.600]  You sound better when he's talking to you.
[18:01.600 --> 18:03.040]  That's my job, keep you on it.
[18:03.040 --> 18:05.600]  So what I was kind of getting at a little bit
[18:05.640 --> 18:09.480]  is right now, master growers and head growers,
[18:09.480 --> 18:11.300]  I'm called a lead cultivator is my official title.
[18:11.300 --> 18:12.280]  I hated the word master grower.
[18:12.280 --> 18:13.120]  So we changed it.
[18:13.120 --> 18:13.940]  I'm a lead cultivator.
[18:13.940 --> 18:15.840]  I lead the cultivation team.
[18:15.840 --> 18:17.960]  We're making hella good money.
[18:17.960 --> 18:20.400]  Like we're being paid fat, chunky salaries
[18:20.400 --> 18:22.760]  as lead cultivators in this industry right now.
[18:22.760 --> 18:24.120]  People that have been at it for,
[18:24.120 --> 18:25.880]  I've been growing cannabis for over 20 years.
[18:25.880 --> 18:27.420]  I've been involved in the cannabis industry
[18:27.420 --> 18:32.420]  or the cannabis scene for, wow, 25 years.
[18:32.420 --> 18:33.360]  Well, I had to think about that.
[18:33.360 --> 18:35.840]  I've been messing with weed for 25 years.
[18:35.840 --> 18:37.040]  And you guys, there's a big difference
[18:37.040 --> 18:39.160]  between being like a weed grower
[18:39.160 --> 18:41.840]  and a cannabis caregiver and being in the industry.
[18:41.840 --> 18:42.960]  If you're not paying taxes on it
[18:42.960 --> 18:44.080]  and you don't have some kind of cannabis
[18:44.080 --> 18:45.800]  MED regulated license,
[18:45.800 --> 18:47.880]  you can't say you're in the industry in Colorado.
[18:47.880 --> 18:49.160]  You're just growing weed now.
[18:49.160 --> 18:51.480]  It's kind of the new standard we're gonna make here.
[18:51.480 --> 18:53.320]  You can't say I do this in the industry.
[18:53.320 --> 18:55.160]  You're a grower, you're underground.
[18:55.160 --> 18:56.500]  Get on paper, come join us.
[18:56.500 --> 18:57.340]  It's fun.
[18:57.340 --> 18:58.720]  Pay taxes, do it correctly.
[18:58.720 --> 19:01.740]  But so what I'm saying is the people that own the industry,
[19:01.740 --> 19:02.880]  they have all kinds of money now.
[19:03.400 --> 19:04.500]  So I think the people like myself
[19:04.500 --> 19:06.780]  that are making good money, we better stick to it.
[19:06.780 --> 19:08.120]  We better make a fat resume.
[19:08.120 --> 19:09.640]  You guys that are trimming, making,
[19:09.640 --> 19:10.720]  I know trimmers that make anywhere
[19:10.720 --> 19:12.540]  between 10 and 20 bucks an hour.
[19:12.540 --> 19:14.320]  If you're making good money trimming,
[19:14.320 --> 19:16.520]  start documenting how many hours you've been trimming.
[19:16.520 --> 19:17.820]  If you're using a trim machine,
[19:17.820 --> 19:18.960]  if you're using the satellite,
[19:18.960 --> 19:20.620]  if you're using the ripper,
[19:20.620 --> 19:22.360]  document how many hours you use on that.
[19:22.360 --> 19:23.680]  Put that as part of your resume.
[19:23.680 --> 19:26.440]  If you know how, if you're applicator certified,
[19:26.440 --> 19:27.500]  that goes on your resume.
[19:27.500 --> 19:28.840]  Because in the future,
[19:28.840 --> 19:32.320]  this is gonna turn into just a basic job, unfortunately.
[19:32.760 --> 19:34.280]  Like Alan said over here, it's a business.
[19:34.280 --> 19:35.480]  Yeah, it's headed that way.
[19:35.480 --> 19:37.440]  Owners aren't gonna wanna pay
[19:37.440 --> 19:39.860]  the next set of growers my salary.
[19:39.860 --> 19:42.880]  The people that come after me are not gonna get paid
[19:42.880 --> 19:45.120]  what this group of growers are getting paid.
[19:45.120 --> 19:46.240]  It's gonna start tapering off
[19:46.240 --> 19:49.240]  because what I think creates a high dollar product
[19:49.240 --> 19:51.320]  is an illegal product.
[19:51.320 --> 19:53.640]  Since it was illegal, it was highly in demand,
[19:53.640 --> 19:55.160]  but there wasn't any supply.
[19:55.160 --> 19:56.000]  Now it's legal.
[19:56.000 --> 19:57.040]  We could grow the shit out of it.
[19:57.040 --> 19:57.880]  We don't have to hide.
[19:57.880 --> 19:59.600]  Why are we charging so much for it?
[19:59.600 --> 20:00.720]  It's only for production.
[20:00.720 --> 20:02.520]  Once we catch up with production,
[20:02.520 --> 20:03.560]  which won't take too long,
[20:03.560 --> 20:05.320]  we're building, their greenhouse is going up
[20:05.320 --> 20:06.600]  every single day.
[20:06.600 --> 20:07.840]  So once we catch up with the production,
[20:07.840 --> 20:09.240]  I see prices going down,
[20:09.240 --> 20:12.040]  and then the producers are going to start being paid less
[20:12.040 --> 20:12.880]  and less.
[20:12.880 --> 20:15.800]  Trimmers aren't gonna get hired on for 15 an hour anymore.
[20:15.800 --> 20:16.920]  The industry is gonna taper off.
[20:16.920 --> 20:19.120]  It'll be any other agricultural industry.
[20:19.120 --> 20:23.720]  You'll find more temporary staffing going on it, probably.
[20:23.720 --> 20:25.840]  But getting back to the leaf cultivator,
[20:25.840 --> 20:30.480]  like any industry, I do believe that if you can show
[20:31.240 --> 20:32.080]  someone that you are worth your money,
[20:32.080 --> 20:34.320]  you can get a higher wage for it.
[20:34.320 --> 20:37.360]  If you can go in there and you can increase production
[20:37.360 --> 20:38.520]  and show them that you can do it,
[20:38.520 --> 20:41.160]  you can bring it up 10, 15, 20%,
[20:41.160 --> 20:43.800]  you'll still have a competitive edge over someone else.
[20:43.800 --> 20:44.640]  Absolutely.
[20:44.640 --> 20:45.480]  To be able to present that.
[20:45.480 --> 20:46.300]  Absolutely.
[20:46.300 --> 20:49.400]  You make good recommendations of absolutely documenting
[20:49.400 --> 20:51.440]  your history and what you've been able to accomplish,
[20:51.440 --> 20:52.840]  and it's gonna make a lot of difference
[20:52.840 --> 20:55.200]  as this industry does change.
[20:55.200 --> 20:56.600]  And that works in any industry.
[20:56.600 --> 20:58.680]  Document what you're doing, have proof.
[20:58.680 --> 21:00.080]  It's just harder in the cannabis industry,
[21:00.720 --> 21:02.760]  but as we're evolving, a lot of guys like us,
[21:02.760 --> 21:04.880]  we're ahead of the game, so stay ahead of the game
[21:04.880 --> 21:05.960]  and document that stuff.
[21:05.960 --> 21:07.960]  Don't get stuck in your bubble and write down
[21:07.960 --> 21:09.160]  everything that you're learning,
[21:09.160 --> 21:10.480]  and that goes on a resume.
[21:10.480 --> 21:12.380]  If you can, like I said, if you can use the satellite,
[21:12.380 --> 21:13.240]  that goes on your resume.
[21:13.240 --> 21:15.680]  If you can use the OB dose, that goes on your resume.
[21:15.680 --> 21:17.240]  If you can run a sweet leaf extractor,
[21:17.240 --> 21:18.880]  that goes on your resume.
[21:18.880 --> 21:21.440]  Because eventually, you guys, you're not gonna...
[21:21.440 --> 21:23.520]  So, Alan brought up a good point.
[21:23.520 --> 21:25.800]  You can impress them and you can jump in
[21:25.800 --> 21:29.020]  and make a few more dollars on your salary,
[21:29.020 --> 21:31.020]  but a lot of those guys, a lot of those jobs
[21:31.020 --> 21:33.300]  are taken by guys like us that gotta jump on it.
[21:33.300 --> 21:34.700]  So, it's the next wave of people.
[21:34.700 --> 21:36.740]  All the rock stars are kinda doing that now.
[21:36.740 --> 21:39.420]  You're gonna have to be a badass to get that kind of a salary
[21:39.420 --> 21:40.380]  in the future, I think.
[21:40.380 --> 21:41.220]  That's my opinion.
[21:41.220 --> 21:43.740]  Yeah, I agree with you on that a lot.
[21:43.740 --> 21:45.580]  It's still gonna come down to networking, too.
[21:45.580 --> 21:47.560]  I've worked in other industries.
[21:47.560 --> 21:49.840]  Networking was important.
[21:49.840 --> 21:53.860]  You have to have those crossover relationships.
[21:53.860 --> 21:55.460]  But nothing like this industry,
[21:55.460 --> 21:57.880]  have I ever experienced where it's so,
[21:57.880 --> 21:59.320]  I use the word incestuous.
[21:59.320 --> 22:02.320]  It really is, you have to know someone
[22:02.320 --> 22:06.320]  in a lot of instances to get in the door.
[22:06.320 --> 22:07.920]  Now, I was pretty fortunate.
[22:07.920 --> 22:10.640]  I got hired on, I've only been in the industry
[22:10.640 --> 22:12.840]  about eight months now.
[22:12.840 --> 22:14.620]  I think I've been badged.
[22:14.620 --> 22:17.500]  And I've worked at a couple other facilities,
[22:17.500 --> 22:19.840]  starting at the ground level, literally.
[22:19.840 --> 22:24.840]  And I did walk into one place and with my crossover skills
[22:25.840 --> 22:28.840]  and my resume, I was able to get in there.
[22:28.840 --> 22:31.360]  But I've had to work and hustle to learn this industry.
[22:31.360 --> 22:32.200]  Oh yeah.
[22:32.200 --> 22:33.520]  But it does matter a lot on,
[22:33.520 --> 22:35.200]  if you can name drop a little bit,
[22:35.200 --> 22:37.240]  I think it helps a tremendous amount,
[22:37.240 --> 22:38.600]  more so in this industry.
[22:38.600 --> 22:41.840]  I can completely testify to your statement.
[22:41.840 --> 22:44.760]  I would not be in the position I'm in if I weren't,
[22:44.760 --> 22:46.040]  I earned it, honestly.
[22:46.040 --> 22:47.400]  I earned the spot.
[22:47.400 --> 22:49.080]  But if I did not know Grimey Gatsby,
[22:49.080 --> 22:51.680]  if I wasn't tight with Hunt like I was,
[22:51.680 --> 22:53.880]  I would not have found my spot where I am.
[22:53.880 --> 22:55.840]  He was my homie from before he had a spot.
[22:55.840 --> 22:57.760]  And when things went wrong, he called me right away.
[22:57.760 --> 22:58.980]  Like you can grow.
[22:58.980 --> 23:00.680]  Yeah, so get out and join the industry.
[23:00.680 --> 23:02.920]  I mean, that's kind of what that you were bringing up.
[23:02.920 --> 23:04.960]  You know, if you can join some other clubs
[23:04.960 --> 23:08.640]  or anything like that, some social groups that are.
[23:08.640 --> 23:11.080]  I think just getting out and getting your badge versus.
[23:11.080 --> 23:11.920]  Well, versus.
[23:11.920 --> 23:12.760]  Go get your badge.
[23:12.760 --> 23:14.280]  Get your badge, that's the very first thing.
[23:14.280 --> 23:16.520]  We did a brief episode on how to get your badge.
[23:16.520 --> 23:18.580]  I should do a complete in-depth episode
[23:18.580 --> 23:19.460]  on how to get your badge.
[23:19.460 --> 23:20.720]  I'm gonna make a note of that here.
[23:20.720 --> 23:21.980]  We're gonna do this in the phone here,
[23:21.980 --> 23:23.520]  since it's right here.
[23:24.160 --> 23:26.280]  Episode about badge.
[23:26.280 --> 23:27.680]  All right, guys, I'll do a full episode
[23:27.680 --> 23:28.780]  on how to get your badge.
[23:28.780 --> 23:30.840]  I'll do a little update thing for you.
[23:30.840 --> 23:32.520]  So you guys are new, kind of fairly new
[23:32.520 --> 23:33.640]  to the legal cannabis industry.
[23:33.640 --> 23:35.240]  Can we talk about what you guys are doing?
[23:35.240 --> 23:36.280]  Or is that, would you like to keep
[23:36.280 --> 23:38.280]  some of that quiet for now?
[23:38.280 --> 23:39.640]  Well, I won't mention who I'm with,
[23:39.640 --> 23:42.280]  because you know, I don't think it's the thing.
[23:42.280 --> 23:45.100]  But yeah, I'm just in quality control,
[23:46.120 --> 23:47.360]  trimming, if you will.
[23:47.360 --> 23:48.200]  Okay.
[23:48.200 --> 23:50.360]  But you know, really those,
[23:50.360 --> 23:54.080]  you'd mentioned dropping the master grower
[23:54.080 --> 23:55.680]  and lead cultivator.
[23:56.760 --> 23:59.720]  The trimmer is the last, well, not the last person,
[23:59.720 --> 24:02.160]  but one of the last people to see
[24:02.160 --> 24:04.600]  what that product's gonna be like when it gets out there.
[24:04.600 --> 24:05.440]  Yeah, you get your hands in it.
[24:05.440 --> 24:07.800]  So it is turning into more of a quality control
[24:10.440 --> 24:12.600]  issue in the industry, I think, too.
[24:12.600 --> 24:14.380]  Do you hear that forward thinking, you guys?
[24:14.380 --> 24:16.360]  That's something we need in the cannabis industry.
[24:16.360 --> 24:18.500]  You're not just a trimmer, you are quality control.
[24:18.500 --> 24:21.580]  You're inspecting my buds that I handed to you to trim.
[24:21.580 --> 24:23.420]  You're the last eyes that are gonna look at them
[24:23.420 --> 24:26.060]  before we put them in a jar and customers touch them.
[24:26.060 --> 24:26.980]  So you have to be-
[24:26.980 --> 24:28.220]  What did I call that the other day on?
[24:28.220 --> 24:30.220]  I forget what I, what would I call that?
[24:32.860 --> 24:33.780]  Flaw inspector.
[24:33.780 --> 24:34.620]  That's a good one.
[24:34.620 --> 24:36.140]  Flaw inspector, yeah.
[24:36.140 --> 24:38.100]  Look for seeds, look for mildew.
[24:38.100 --> 24:38.940]  Flaw inspector.
[24:38.940 --> 24:40.580]  Look for anything that we may have overlooked.
[24:40.580 --> 24:41.420]  Yeah, find it for us.
[24:41.420 --> 24:43.620]  It's the last eyes before it hits the shelves.
[24:43.620 --> 24:44.460]  Yeah, that's right.
[24:44.460 --> 24:45.660]  Quality control, I like it.
[24:45.660 --> 24:46.940]  Yeah, so be a forward thinker.
[24:46.940 --> 24:48.420]  If you're gonna come join the cannabis industry,
[24:48.820 --> 24:50.900]  just like he's saying, you're not just trimming it.
[24:50.900 --> 24:52.420]  You're not staring into the buds all day.
[24:52.420 --> 24:54.260]  You are making sure they are beautiful
[24:54.260 --> 24:55.300]  so that when I put them in the jar
[24:55.300 --> 24:56.580]  and the patients come in, they go,
[24:56.580 --> 24:58.460]  oh, who trimmed that black cherry, Kim?
[24:58.460 --> 24:59.660]  I wanna smoke it all.
[24:59.660 --> 25:01.140]  Yeah, especially on the hand trimming.
[25:01.140 --> 25:04.960]  You know, it really is a, it's a fun skill to learn.
[25:04.960 --> 25:09.380]  I mean, it takes a lot of technique and it can be boring,
[25:09.380 --> 25:12.060]  but I mean, you have some great conversations over the table.
[25:12.060 --> 25:15.000]  You meet such a wide variety of personalities
[25:15.000 --> 25:15.840]  in the industry.
[25:15.840 --> 25:17.300]  Oh yeah, so many different people.
[25:17.300 --> 25:18.420]  Many that have been, yeah,
[25:18.420 --> 25:20.540]  I've been out doing other industries,
[25:20.540 --> 25:22.580]  real estate for 20 years.
[25:22.580 --> 25:25.100]  I actually find that I'm always the minority at the table
[25:25.100 --> 25:26.100]  and I'm the native.
[25:27.020 --> 25:27.860]  I always find that.
[25:27.860 --> 25:30.020]  I always find that out to be.
[25:30.020 --> 25:31.900]  Everyone else is from out of state.
[25:31.900 --> 25:33.780]  Yeah, oh, everybody's moving to Colorado.
[25:33.780 --> 25:35.060]  Everybody's moving here.
[25:35.060 --> 25:35.980]  It's getting a little crowded.
[25:35.980 --> 25:37.740]  It's starting to get the rents going up.
[25:37.740 --> 25:39.060]  It's getting a little bit full.
[25:39.060 --> 25:41.260]  They have an abundance of labor for the market,
[25:41.260 --> 25:42.620]  so it is competitive.
[25:43.660 --> 25:45.740]  You know, so work on your skills
[25:45.740 --> 25:49.380]  and work on getting to know people in the industry
[25:49.380 --> 25:51.100]  where someone will give you a chance.
[25:51.100 --> 25:53.920]  Then like every other thing, show up and do your stuff.
[25:53.920 --> 25:55.540]  You know, it's not a place where you just sit around
[25:55.540 --> 25:57.620]  and party or I think there's a lot of people
[25:57.620 --> 25:58.820]  that wanna get into the industry
[25:58.820 --> 26:00.900]  because they think it was like high school
[26:00.900 --> 26:02.020]  where everybody just sits around
[26:02.020 --> 26:03.500]  and tokes around the table or something.
[26:03.500 --> 26:05.540]  It sounds like that, but I'm the lead cultivator.
[26:05.540 --> 26:06.380]  It's a serious business.
[26:06.380 --> 26:07.800]  And I will send you the fuck home
[26:07.800 --> 26:08.820]  if you're playing with your phone.
[26:08.820 --> 26:09.660]  There you go.
[26:09.660 --> 26:10.740]  If you're standing over there in the corner.
[26:10.740 --> 26:11.580]  Like, it's cool.
[26:11.580 --> 26:12.400]  Take a couple of pictures.
[26:12.400 --> 26:13.240]  It's a huge garden.
[26:13.240 --> 26:14.060]  It looks great.
[26:14.060 --> 26:14.900]  Take a couple of pictures.
[26:15.620 --> 26:18.020]  But take your pictures right before, right after your shift.
[26:18.020 --> 26:20.260]  When you can do it, walk in, take them or finish up,
[26:20.260 --> 26:22.540]  take them, but don't pull out your phone every 20 minutes
[26:22.540 --> 26:23.380]  to take a picture.
[26:23.380 --> 26:24.900]  Don't text your girlfriend all the time.
[26:24.900 --> 26:26.820]  Just do some shit while you're in there.
[26:26.820 --> 26:28.460]  Don't just be walking around smelling plants
[26:28.460 --> 26:29.700]  and sniffing your fingers.
[26:29.700 --> 26:30.820]  Yeah, there's work to be done.
[26:30.820 --> 26:33.560]  There's 300 plants and 85 lights in one room.
[26:33.560 --> 26:35.820]  And I called you over for a few hours of work.
[26:35.820 --> 26:37.540]  I need you to work, not play with your phone.
[26:37.540 --> 26:40.460]  So if you're in the industry, appreciate your position.
[26:40.460 --> 26:42.340]  Start taking notes of everything you do.
[26:42.340 --> 26:44.200]  Document all that stuff.
[26:44.240 --> 26:46.880]  Make sure you're getting paid a fair wage.
[26:46.880 --> 26:49.000]  Kind of pay attention to the way that the market
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.080]  in this industry is going.
[26:50.080 --> 26:52.520]  And make sure that you are getting a competitive wage
[26:52.520 --> 26:54.160]  and bring it to your employer's attention
[26:54.160 --> 26:55.680]  that you can now run an OB dose.
[26:55.680 --> 26:56.880]  You can now run a satellite.
[26:56.880 --> 26:58.380]  Make sure that all that shit is noticed.
[26:58.380 --> 27:00.360]  Make sure you're getting paid for what you're doing.
[27:00.360 --> 27:02.800]  If you're coming to join the industry,
[27:02.800 --> 27:04.320]  I would say get a key badge.
[27:04.320 --> 27:05.880]  Don't even waste time with a support badge.
[27:05.880 --> 27:07.520]  You're worth more money with the key badge.
[27:07.520 --> 27:08.880]  Go get that.
[27:08.880 --> 27:09.720]  Yeah.
[27:09.720 --> 27:10.540]  I agree.
[27:10.540 --> 27:11.380]  I'll testify to that for sure.
[27:11.380 --> 27:12.220]  Yeah.
[27:12.220 --> 27:13.040]  All right.
[27:13.040 --> 27:14.000]  So we've been going about a half hour.
[27:14.760 --> 27:15.600]  You guys want to take some dabs?
[27:15.600 --> 27:16.720]  Oh, most definitely.
[27:16.720 --> 27:18.040]  Alan's never taken a dab.
[27:18.040 --> 27:20.480]  Are you interested in taking a first dab on a podcast?
[27:20.480 --> 27:21.320]  I'm still going to be an observer tonight.
[27:21.320 --> 27:22.160]  I still like my hair.
[27:22.160 --> 27:22.980]  No peer pressure.
[27:22.980 --> 27:25.260]  There was one offer I'm not going to twist his arm, you guys.
[27:25.260 --> 27:27.880]  We're going to smoke some of this Lemon G.
[27:27.880 --> 27:29.600]  I should ask a question to get you guys going,
[27:29.600 --> 27:31.280]  but I didn't think of a good question yet.
[27:31.280 --> 27:32.440]  We already talked about.
[27:32.440 --> 27:34.880]  So what do you think of this whole concentrate scene?
[27:34.880 --> 27:35.720]  Where did you come from?
[27:35.720 --> 27:36.680]  You're new here to Colorado.
[27:36.680 --> 27:37.520]  Arizona.
[27:37.520 --> 27:40.680]  I've been up here a year in December.
[27:40.680 --> 27:42.080]  Oh, well, wow.
[27:42.080 --> 27:43.760]  So you've come a long way in just a year.
[27:44.520 --> 27:45.360]  See, this guy's a go-getter.
[27:45.360 --> 27:46.280]  He didn't sit on the couch and fuck around
[27:46.280 --> 27:47.120]  when he got here.
[27:47.120 --> 27:47.960]  He got here.
[27:47.960 --> 27:49.800]  That's one of the reasons why I like it.
[27:49.800 --> 27:52.400]  That's what I would encourage everyone else out there
[27:52.400 --> 27:54.160]  that's going to do this.
[27:54.160 --> 27:56.440]  Treat it like it's a job.
[27:57.560 --> 27:59.080]  Yeah, it's certainly using a product
[27:59.080 --> 28:01.920]  that's always been associated with good times.
[28:01.920 --> 28:05.620]  And we want everybody to get the medicinal help out of it
[28:05.620 --> 28:06.720]  that they need.
[28:06.720 --> 28:08.520]  And with the wreck,
[28:09.400 --> 28:13.600]  people that just want to use it for enjoyment
[28:14.440 --> 28:17.400]  and to get the benefits that it brings us.
[28:17.400 --> 28:20.400]  But when you're on the job, it's a job.
[28:20.400 --> 28:23.120]  You have to make sure that all of those other
[28:23.120 --> 28:26.080]  components work or it'll be a short-lived industry.
[28:26.080 --> 28:27.280]  The cash register has to come out
[28:27.280 --> 28:28.120]  right at the end of the night.
[28:28.120 --> 28:28.960]  There you go.
[28:28.960 --> 28:30.600]  Yeah, you can't do that if you're too high.
[28:30.600 --> 28:32.080]  So what do you think of this whole hash scene
[28:32.080 --> 28:34.280]  and the way that we all just smoke a shit ton of hash here?
[28:34.280 --> 28:35.560]  Was it like that at all in Arizona?
[28:35.560 --> 28:37.600]  Or is that just kind of a Colorado thing?
[28:38.520 --> 28:39.360]  Well, you know what?
[28:39.360 --> 28:41.240]  I wasn't in the industry down there.
[28:41.240 --> 28:43.560]  I don't know if people were, what they were doing.
[28:43.560 --> 28:45.040]  You guys enjoy it up here.
[28:45.040 --> 28:47.520]  I think if I was gonna get Alan to smoke some hash right now
[28:47.520 --> 28:50.520]  it'd probably have to be some bubble hash
[28:50.520 --> 28:53.080]  or some ice hash or something like that.
[28:53.080 --> 28:56.200]  Well, I've got dry sift, I've got bubble, I've got crumble.
[28:56.200 --> 28:59.120]  I've got 9,000 different kinds of hash here.
[28:59.120 --> 28:59.960]  Come on, Alan.
[28:59.960 --> 29:00.800]  I'm not gonna push you.
[29:00.800 --> 29:02.760]  You know like the old school stuff, you know like how-
[29:02.760 --> 29:04.040]  Don't peer pressure the guy.
[29:04.040 --> 29:05.000]  Oh wait, I need the rig.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.120]  You need the dabber with a dab on it.
[29:07.120 --> 29:08.560]  No, no peer pressure.
[29:08.560 --> 29:10.120]  I'm kind of a quiet guy anyway.
[29:10.400 --> 29:11.240]  I'm gonna start.
[29:12.480 --> 29:14.200]  Him and our buddy Ernie is-
[29:14.200 --> 29:15.960]  He's come across as very well-spoken
[29:15.960 --> 29:17.280]  and very intelligent so far.
[29:17.280 --> 29:20.320]  Let's let him continue that reputation on the show.
[29:20.320 --> 29:24.600]  And we won't turn him into a bubble or a puddle.
[29:24.600 --> 29:26.240]  We won't do that to him on this podcast.
[29:26.240 --> 29:28.360]  I'm not gonna twist his arm here.
[29:28.360 --> 29:30.440]  I'm heating up the highly educated.
[29:30.440 --> 29:32.200]  This one's the duality nail.
[29:32.200 --> 29:34.760]  You know, I do have to say, I used to,
[29:34.760 --> 29:37.320]  when I participated when it wasn't legal
[29:38.320 --> 29:42.960]  as a younger man, I had one of the old hobbit bongs
[29:42.960 --> 29:45.320]  that I used to smoke my stuff through.
[29:45.320 --> 29:48.960]  I had a wonderful ex-wife.
[29:48.960 --> 29:51.520]  Now she's wonderful because she's an ex.
[29:51.520 --> 29:52.360]  So this is the lemon juice.
[29:52.360 --> 29:53.200]  Is that what this is?
[29:53.200 --> 29:54.040]  Yes.
[29:54.040 --> 29:55.080]  Awesome.
[29:55.080 --> 29:57.160]  But I love you the glassware that you have here.
[29:57.160 --> 30:00.720]  I mean, to sit here, you don't have to really smoke
[30:00.720 --> 30:03.200]  to appreciate the art or the craftsmanship in it.
[30:03.200 --> 30:04.200]  You don't have to do that.
[30:04.200 --> 30:07.280]  It is really, pardon me.
[30:08.120 --> 30:10.840]  You can see why someone who has the budget
[30:10.840 --> 30:14.000]  may spend the money on one.
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.320]  You know, art is subjective
[30:17.880 --> 30:21.240]  and it's not jumping back to what we were talking
[30:21.240 --> 30:22.320]  about earlier.
[30:22.320 --> 30:24.160]  And when I'm sitting here looking at what you have
[30:24.160 --> 30:27.800]  on the table, I mean, there's three beautiful pieces.
[30:27.800 --> 30:28.840]  Well, thank you.
[30:28.840 --> 30:31.240]  Two hitmans and then a piece from Elevate.
[30:31.240 --> 30:33.640]  I think it's so trippy how glass has changed.
[30:33.640 --> 30:34.480]  Microphone.
[30:34.480 --> 30:36.240]  I think it's so trippy how glass has changed.
[30:36.240 --> 30:40.400]  Like what in maybe the last 10 years.
[30:40.400 --> 30:43.320]  I remember just going into the glass shop.
[30:43.320 --> 30:45.880]  It was kind of like so, so, you know.
[30:45.880 --> 30:47.760]  And then now this just seems like the glass shops
[30:47.760 --> 30:50.520]  have just exploded with all the dab, the dab.
[30:50.520 --> 30:51.360]  The dab thing.
[30:51.360 --> 30:53.040]  All the dab scene and all that.
[30:53.040 --> 30:53.880]  All the rigs.
[30:53.880 --> 30:55.680]  There's something about being a grower.
[30:55.680 --> 30:58.000]  I caught myself falling into it.
[30:58.000 --> 31:00.320]  When you harvest, you have too much money for a minute.
[31:00.320 --> 31:03.120]  And like any young guy that has too much money
[31:03.120 --> 31:04.880]  and a big ego and shit going on,
[31:04.880 --> 31:06.560]  you gotta go buy something.
[31:06.560 --> 31:07.940]  And I don't do the gold chains.
[31:07.940 --> 31:09.680]  I don't do rims on my car.
[31:09.680 --> 31:11.880]  And the thing I like to do is smoke hash
[31:11.880 --> 31:12.780]  and listen to good music.
[31:12.780 --> 31:14.880]  So I've got a slamming stereo system.
[31:14.880 --> 31:16.580]  I got really good headphones on.
[31:16.580 --> 31:18.680]  And I've got really nice hash toys.
[31:18.680 --> 31:21.320]  So that's every harvest I would go buy something ridiculous.
[31:21.320 --> 31:23.840]  Like this was one of my first good harvest hitmen
[31:23.840 --> 31:24.680]  we were talking about.
[31:24.680 --> 31:26.320]  That was like a harvest that I grew.
[31:26.320 --> 31:27.280]  This one here.
[31:27.280 --> 31:28.560]  I just drew some extra herb.
[31:28.560 --> 31:29.840]  I was like, I'm gonna set up this room.
[31:29.840 --> 31:32.000]  And that extra room bought me that rig
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.760]  was pretty much what I pulled out of their extra, you know.
[31:35.600 --> 31:36.440]  So stuff like that.
[31:36.440 --> 31:38.000]  I'm just gonna go buy a rig instead of buying rims
[31:38.000 --> 31:39.960]  and gold chains and jerseys.
[31:39.960 --> 31:40.800]  This is much better.
[31:40.800 --> 31:42.360]  I agree, much better.
[31:42.360 --> 31:43.320]  Oh yeah.
[31:43.320 --> 31:45.280]  And if gold chains and Air Jordans are your thing,
[31:45.280 --> 31:46.120]  fucking rock them.
[31:46.120 --> 31:47.440]  I'd rather have a hitman rig.
[31:47.440 --> 31:49.080]  You can come hit my rig.
[31:49.080 --> 31:50.120]  You'll look stylish doing it.
[31:50.120 --> 31:51.720]  I'm not worried about looking that styly.
[31:51.720 --> 31:53.400]  I like skate shoes and Dickies.
[31:53.400 --> 31:55.200]  Nice and easy for me.
[31:55.200 --> 31:57.080]  What's the new one that you got there?
[31:57.080 --> 31:59.200]  This is called the Hitman Short Stack.
[31:59.200 --> 32:00.480]  And it's the one we were hitting a little earlier.
[32:00.480 --> 32:01.880]  So shout out again to Hitman Dougie.
[32:01.880 --> 32:03.320]  Shout out to Ryan at Hitman Glass.
[32:03.320 --> 32:04.800]  Hey Ryan, I got the rig.
[32:04.800 --> 32:05.960]  I was supposed to tell you when I got this.
[32:05.960 --> 32:06.800]  It's here, dude.
[32:06.800 --> 32:07.620]  I've got it.
[32:07.620 --> 32:09.760]  I forgot to send you that email, but thank you.
[32:09.760 --> 32:10.600]  It's kind of clogged up.
[32:10.600 --> 32:12.080]  We should clean it.
[32:12.080 --> 32:13.680]  That's something I could talk about.
[32:13.680 --> 32:15.480]  How to clean your rig.
[32:15.480 --> 32:17.560]  That is a good chunk in there.
[32:17.560 --> 32:20.480]  That's probably a half gram of just stuck in there.
[32:20.480 --> 32:21.400]  Yeah, and that's just,
[32:21.400 --> 32:23.440]  that's a very intricate piece to be trying to.
[32:23.440 --> 32:24.840]  I'm gonna have to dissolve it really well
[32:24.840 --> 32:25.720]  with rubbing alcohol.
[32:25.720 --> 32:29.600]  So get you some 91% isopropyl alcohol.
[32:29.600 --> 32:32.000]  Just fill the rig up as high as you can with alcohol.
[32:32.000 --> 32:33.600]  Let it sit for a few.
[32:33.600 --> 32:36.040]  And then pour a little bit of kosher salt in there.
[32:36.040 --> 32:37.880]  The kosher salt's real rough.
[32:37.880 --> 32:39.120]  And then shake the shit out of the rig.
[32:39.120 --> 32:41.000]  Cover the holes with your thumbs.
[32:41.000 --> 32:42.120]  And shake the shit out of it.
[32:42.120 --> 32:42.960]  Don't drop it.
[32:42.960 --> 32:43.880]  Do it over the carpet.
[32:43.880 --> 32:45.640]  Do it over the couch if you feel like you're clumsy.
[32:45.640 --> 32:47.360]  And just shake the fucking shit out of it.
[32:47.360 --> 32:48.360]  And it'll scrub it up real good.
[32:48.360 --> 32:50.300]  And then rinse it with hot water a few times.
[32:50.300 --> 32:51.200]  Let it cool off.
[32:51.200 --> 32:53.200]  And then you're ready to dab again if you do it right.
[32:53.200 --> 32:54.760]  You know, actually one of the things I noticed
[32:54.760 --> 32:57.040]  is if you give it a decent,
[32:57.040 --> 32:57.880]  well I don't know about that.
[32:57.880 --> 32:59.160]  That piece is pretty intricate.
[32:59.160 --> 33:01.400]  But I noticed that when you're done,
[33:01.400 --> 33:03.640]  if you want to leave it nice and streak free,
[33:03.640 --> 33:05.880]  you give it another rinse with the alcohol
[33:05.880 --> 33:08.720]  and let it air dry real good.
[33:08.720 --> 33:09.560]  Let the alcohol dry on there?
[33:09.560 --> 33:10.400]  Okay.
[33:10.400 --> 33:11.220]  Exactly.
[33:11.220 --> 33:12.060]  And it'll get a nice.
[33:12.060 --> 33:12.900]  Polish it up a little bit.
[33:12.900 --> 33:13.720]  Almost like the day you got it.
[33:13.720 --> 33:14.600]  That was a super good tip right there
[33:14.600 --> 33:16.800]  for all you glass nerds when you're done cleaning your rig.
[33:16.800 --> 33:18.720]  Well Carlos got a lot of good tips for people.
[33:18.720 --> 33:19.560]  He's a sharp guy.
[33:19.560 --> 33:20.400]  Yeah he does.
[33:20.400 --> 33:21.640]  Well now that you're comfortable with the headphones
[33:21.640 --> 33:23.540]  and the mic, we'll have you back on for another show.
[33:23.540 --> 33:25.240]  And I'll have like stuff written down for you.
[33:25.240 --> 33:26.720]  Because we'll talk about how you grow and stuff.
[33:26.720 --> 33:27.560]  I know how you grow,
[33:27.560 --> 33:29.240]  but we'll let you teach the listeners.
[33:29.240 --> 33:31.240]  You guys, we've been going for like 33 minutes.
[33:32.080 --> 33:33.280]  If you got anything else that you want to say to,
[33:33.280 --> 33:34.400]  I'm going to let you guys know now
[33:34.400 --> 33:36.020]  that the show is toward the end.
[33:36.020 --> 33:36.860]  When this comes out,
[33:36.860 --> 33:39.440]  within 48 hours of this episode being posted,
[33:39.440 --> 33:42.040]  5,000 people will download and listen to this episode.
[33:42.040 --> 33:43.240]  It'll come out on a Monday.
[33:43.240 --> 33:45.720]  By Tuesday at midnight, 5,000 downloads.
[33:45.720 --> 33:46.960]  So a lot of people are going to hear
[33:46.960 --> 33:48.520]  all the stuff you had to say today.
[33:48.520 --> 33:49.360]  Awesome.
[33:49.360 --> 33:50.200]  Cool.
[33:50.200 --> 33:51.020]  I wait until the end of the show to tell people
[33:51.020 --> 33:51.860]  how many people are going to hear it.
[33:51.860 --> 33:53.720]  So if you got anything you want to say to that many people,
[33:53.720 --> 33:54.560]  now's your chance.
[33:54.560 --> 33:56.000]  Microphone is on.
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.120]  I don't do shout outs or anything like that.
[33:58.120 --> 33:58.960]  All right.
[33:58.960 --> 34:00.280]  All right.
[34:00.280 --> 34:02.480]  No, I don't have anybody to represent.
[34:02.480 --> 34:05.160]  Always encourage people to be responsible.
[34:05.160 --> 34:07.520]  Make sure you get out there and support the people
[34:07.520 --> 34:09.680]  that are supporting this industry.
[34:09.680 --> 34:13.080]  You know, whatever it is, if it's a politician,
[34:13.080 --> 34:15.560]  make sure that they have your interest at heart
[34:15.560 --> 34:20.360]  and get out there and support those guys doing that.
[34:20.360 --> 34:21.200]  There you go.
[34:21.200 --> 34:22.040]  That's very wise words.
[34:22.040 --> 34:22.860]  I want to thank both of you guys for coming.
[34:22.860 --> 34:23.920]  This is a great show, you guys.
[34:23.920 --> 34:24.760]  Great to be here.
[34:24.760 --> 34:25.580]  Good conversational show.
[34:25.580 --> 34:26.880]  Hey, Rob, get well soon, man,
[34:26.880 --> 34:27.960]  because I need you on the show.
[34:27.960 --> 34:29.680]  I'm going to have Rob from Sour Seed on
[34:30.040 --> 34:31.600]  a very soon episode.
[34:31.600 --> 34:34.540]  We're going to talk about selecting males for breeding.
[34:34.540 --> 34:37.240]  That should be a very fun episode to good breeders.
[34:37.240 --> 34:38.840]  We may get Rusty from Canaventure.
[34:38.840 --> 34:41.020]  If he's available, he has to travel an hour to get here.
[34:41.020 --> 34:42.960]  But if he can come, if we can all match up,
[34:42.960 --> 34:46.360]  we have three well-known seed breeders here.
[34:46.360 --> 34:47.760]  We'll answer some questions.
[34:47.760 --> 34:49.480]  If you guys have questions about selecting a male,
[34:49.480 --> 34:51.240]  email it to me, growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[34:51.240 --> 34:52.340]  We'll talk about that.
[34:53.440 --> 34:55.240]  I think that's all I've got for you.
[34:55.240 --> 34:56.760]  Let's start wrapping up the show.
[34:56.760 --> 34:59.000]  I'm digging for that paper that I read at the end.
[34:59.840 --> 35:00.880]  I don't know where it is.
[35:00.880 --> 35:01.720]  So we're just going to go like this.
[35:01.720 --> 35:03.600]  I don't know, remind me to ask him.
[35:03.600 --> 35:04.440]  I got, uh-oh.
[35:04.440 --> 35:06.920]  We have to select a male for some seed.
[35:06.920 --> 35:08.200]  You guys are selecting a male?
[35:08.200 --> 35:09.960]  I have to, well, I mean, not now,
[35:09.960 --> 35:13.000]  but I have to get into that.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.400]  Get the wheel rolling in that direction.
[35:15.400 --> 35:17.840]  All right, well, maybe you guys can come hang out
[35:17.840 --> 35:18.680]  when Rob's here.
[35:18.680 --> 35:20.160]  Yeah, that would be cool.
[35:20.160 --> 35:21.120]  Cool, all right.
[35:21.120 --> 35:22.180]  So guys, I want to thank you for listening.
[35:22.180 --> 35:23.160]  I'll be back in another week.
[35:23.160 --> 35:25.240]  Hopefully Rob will be better by then.
[35:25.240 --> 35:26.360]  If not, he'll be here in two weeks.
[35:26.360 --> 35:27.200]  No pressure, Rob.
[35:27.200 --> 35:28.040]  I love you, bro.
[35:28.040 --> 35:28.860]  Get well soon.
[35:29.720 --> 35:30.740]  Everybody send a good vibration to Rob.
[35:30.740 --> 35:31.980]  He needs some love right now.
[35:31.980 --> 35:33.500]  I don't forget to, yeah.
[35:33.500 --> 35:35.540]  Don't forget to check out the sponsors, Hitman Glass.
[35:35.540 --> 35:37.060]  Big shout out to Hitman Dougie.
[35:37.060 --> 35:37.980]  Now that the show's over, you guys,
[35:37.980 --> 35:39.820]  please go to the iTunes store.
[35:39.820 --> 35:41.140]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[35:41.140 --> 35:43.300]  Give me a five-star rating and type in a little comment.
[35:43.300 --> 35:44.700]  Let me know what you think of the show,
[35:44.700 --> 35:47.320]  and I will read your comments on a future episode.

[35:51.620 --> 35:52.740]  I'll get us caught up.
[35:53.700 --> 35:54.900]  I've been talking about the email address
[35:54.900 --> 35:56.180]  and the Twitter account the whole episode.
[35:56.180 --> 35:57.500]  GrowFromYourHeart.hotmail.com,
[35:57.500 --> 35:59.860]  and on Twitter, it's at GFYHpodcast.
[35:59.860 --> 36:02.620]  Don't forget the show is available on iTunes and Stitcher,
[36:02.620 --> 36:04.460]  and almost every episode is available
[36:04.460 --> 36:06.900]  on iReadGeneticsColorado.com.
[36:06.900 --> 36:08.100]  Something went weird on the website.
[36:08.100 --> 36:09.340]  A few of the episodes are gone,
[36:09.340 --> 36:11.540]  like episodes one through 27 or something.
[36:11.540 --> 36:12.940]  They kinda disappeared.
[36:12.940 --> 36:14.420]  Don't worry, I'll get them back up there.
[36:14.420 --> 36:16.300]  I will fix that.
[36:16.300 --> 36:17.820]  Don't forget that there's a donation button
[36:17.820 --> 36:19.540]  on the podcast page.

[36:51.420 --> 36:52.980]  I'm at almost to 30,000 again.
[36:52.980 --> 36:54.380]  Shout-out to my ninja spence.
[36:54.380 --> 36:55.220]  Thanks again for listening.
[36:55.220 --> 36:56.820]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[36:56.820 --> 36:58.500]  and give your mom a hug for me.
