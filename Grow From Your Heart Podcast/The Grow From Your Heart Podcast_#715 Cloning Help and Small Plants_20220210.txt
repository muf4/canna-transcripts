[00:00.000 --> 00:49.090]  Alright, here we go.
[00:49.090 --> 00:50.530]  Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[00:50.530 --> 00:51.530]  I'm your host.
[00:51.530 --> 00:52.930]  Please call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:52.930 --> 00:58.470]  This is episode 715 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:58.470 --> 01:01.310]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a few grow questions.
[01:01.310 --> 01:04.890]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[01:04.890 --> 01:09.690]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[01:09.690 --> 01:12.170]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[01:32.150 --> 01:34.470]  Let's send a big fist bump to Dank Grose.
[01:34.470 --> 01:38.310]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:38.310 --> 01:40.550]  to my friend Jesse Grose.
[01:40.550 --> 01:45.550]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[02:04.070 --> 02:05.990]  of my friends.
[02:05.990 --> 02:09.790]  I do apologize if you hear my voice getting raspy there already at the start of the show.
[02:09.790 --> 02:13.750]  I did take a few fat dabs today and they are working.
[02:13.750 --> 02:15.110]  I'm going through one of those phases.
[02:15.110 --> 02:17.030]  I talk about this occasionally on the show.
[02:17.030 --> 02:19.110]  I'm curious how your life is, how you stand.
[02:19.110 --> 02:20.310]  I talk a lot.
[02:20.310 --> 02:21.310]  Let's communicate a little bit.
[02:21.310 --> 02:23.870]  Tell me on Twitter at GFYH podcast.
[02:23.870 --> 02:24.950]  Send me an email.
[02:24.950 --> 02:29.350]  Do you go through phases where you can smoke a lot and you don't get blazed or some days
[02:29.350 --> 02:32.710]  you can smoke very little and you get blazed all the way?
[02:32.710 --> 02:35.590]  The past two days I could just smoke.
[02:35.590 --> 02:37.750]  I was like a fog machine.
[02:37.750 --> 02:42.590]  My job and my duty was to see how many grams of concentrates I could put through my rig
[02:42.590 --> 02:45.190]  and through my lungs and I wasn't getting blazed.
[02:45.190 --> 02:46.190]  I don't know why.
[02:46.190 --> 02:48.670]  I was just getting work done and I couldn't fucking stop.
[02:48.670 --> 02:50.230]  I was just smoking and smoking.
[02:50.230 --> 02:51.590]  My brain was like, no, do more work.
[02:51.590 --> 02:52.590]  Keep going.
[02:52.590 --> 02:53.590]  You're not high yet.
[02:53.590 --> 02:56.190]  So I just take more dabs and do more work and I just didn't feel like I got blazed for
[02:56.190 --> 02:57.310]  like two straight days.
[02:57.310 --> 03:02.030]  But today I've been smoking the same concentrates that I smoked for the past two days and today
[03:02.030 --> 03:05.470]  that first dab of today, that shit wrecked me.
[03:05.470 --> 03:08.830]  That kicked my ass and every dab after that has been beautiful as well.
[03:08.830 --> 03:11.590]  So do you go through phases?
[03:11.590 --> 03:15.230]  Like I said, sometimes I can smoke all the dabs and I don't get high, but then there's
[03:15.230 --> 03:19.430]  some days when I can open the jar and look at the dabs and I'm like, I'm so high, I need
[03:19.430 --> 03:20.430]  munchies.
[03:20.430 --> 03:21.430]  Do you do that?
[03:21.430 --> 03:22.430]  Does your body do that?
[03:22.430 --> 03:25.430]  I think mine is attributed to a lot of his hydration.
[03:25.430 --> 03:29.830]  I think if I'm dehydrated, I'll get super blazed super quickly and I cough more.
[03:29.830 --> 03:30.950]  My lungs burn.
[03:30.950 --> 03:31.950]  A lot of it is diet.
[03:31.950 --> 03:32.950]  Have I eaten enough?
[03:32.950 --> 03:37.130]  If I've had too much sugar, too much junk, then maybe I don't get as blazed.
[03:37.130 --> 03:38.990]  Also sometimes I'm just in the fucking zone.
[03:38.990 --> 03:42.350]  My brain is like, dude, you're going to do work today and nothing is going to stop you.
[03:42.350 --> 03:46.310]  And I just, I ended up transplanting everything, cleaning everything.
[03:46.310 --> 03:50.350]  My brain was on fire that day, but today anyway, I am going to be high and rambly because the
[03:50.350 --> 03:51.750]  dabs are working today.
[03:51.750 --> 03:54.270]  They're back in full effect.
[03:54.270 --> 03:58.190]  Let's try to keep my high ass in focus on track on some sort of path here.
[03:58.190 --> 03:59.550]  I do have a few notes.
[03:59.550 --> 04:06.870]  The next note on my list is that I have added the Iry Genetics merchandise store to my Instagram
[04:06.870 --> 04:07.870]  page.
[04:07.990 --> 04:11.030]  I figured out how to use Instagram as a store.
[04:11.030 --> 04:16.750]  If you go to the Iry underscore genetics Instagram page, Iry underscore genetics on Instagram,
[04:16.750 --> 04:19.750]  on the top there, there is a shop now or visit the store button.
[04:19.750 --> 04:23.790]  I'm not sure what it will say for your button, but you can click on the visit the shop is
[04:23.790 --> 04:24.790]  what I think it should say.
[04:24.790 --> 04:29.970]  Since I edited it, you can click on visit the shop and you'll be able to buy a hats
[04:29.970 --> 04:31.830]  and t-shirts and other things like that.
[04:31.830 --> 04:34.950]  Then it will take you to the web store where you can find all of the other merchandise
[04:35.030 --> 04:38.750]  like stickers, trays, grinders, a lot of stuff is there.
[04:38.750 --> 04:41.970]  Just one more avenue for you to be able to find the store.
[04:41.970 --> 04:44.350]  If you're not already following the Instagram, you're messing up.
[04:44.350 --> 04:49.310]  My Instagram is Iry underscore genetics, I-R-I-E really quickly here.
[04:49.310 --> 04:51.830]  Iry, a lot of people call me Iry genetics.
[04:51.830 --> 04:52.830]  That's cool.
[04:52.830 --> 04:53.830]  Call me what you like, but the word is Iry.
[04:53.830 --> 04:55.550]  Iry is a Jamaican word.
[04:55.550 --> 04:59.670]  It means to feel as blessed as you could feel is basically what that means.
[04:59.670 --> 05:02.150]  If you're at a reggae show and you hear them go, how you feeling?
[05:02.150 --> 05:03.150]  The crowd goes, Iry.
[05:03.150 --> 05:04.150]  It's because you're feeling Iry, bro.
[05:04.350 --> 05:05.350]  You just feel good.
[05:05.350 --> 05:10.790]  I describe it as for me, Iry is like sitting on the top of a grassy hill.
[05:10.790 --> 05:14.430]  I like that cold feeling of when the sun is shining and the grass is cool.
[05:14.430 --> 05:16.350]  I'm sitting in the grass.
[05:16.350 --> 05:21.870]  Maybe you got a lady next to me, maybe a dog on the other side of me, maybe multiple dogs.
[05:21.870 --> 05:23.110]  The sun is just setting.
[05:23.110 --> 05:24.230]  The breeze is just right.
[05:24.230 --> 05:25.230]  The vibe is good.
[05:25.230 --> 05:27.190]  I got a fat spliff burning.
[05:27.190 --> 05:28.490]  Nothing could go wrong.
[05:28.490 --> 05:30.430]  No worries in my mind at all.
[05:30.430 --> 05:31.990]  The weather is good.
[05:31.990 --> 05:36.030]  That little breeze, the grass, your partner, whoever is with you, whatever you're into.
[05:36.030 --> 05:38.350]  If you're into fucking snakes and parrots, have some of them with you.
[05:38.350 --> 05:41.470]  If you want to be surrounded by trolls and monkeys, you can have those too.
[05:41.470 --> 05:44.870]  But in my mind, I got a pretty lady with me, got a couple of dogs hanging out.
[05:44.870 --> 05:46.670]  There's a breeze, but that is Iry.
[05:46.670 --> 05:48.710]  That's just feeling as good as you could feel, man.
[05:48.710 --> 05:49.910]  Everything feels nice.
[05:49.910 --> 05:50.910]  That is Iry.
[05:50.910 --> 05:53.750]  So Iry Genetics, that's the name of my seed company.
[05:53.750 --> 05:57.790]  That is my Instagram, Iry, because that's what's better than just feeling Iry.
[05:57.790 --> 05:58.790]  It feels good.
[05:58.790 --> 05:59.790]  It feels great.
[05:59.790 --> 06:00.790]  It's a good feeling.
[06:00.790 --> 06:02.270]  You have to feel blessed and powerful and pleasing.
[06:02.270 --> 06:04.310]  It's just that feeling of feeling good.
[06:04.310 --> 06:06.190]  Just the best that you could feel.
[06:06.190 --> 06:07.190]  Nothing's wrong.
[06:07.190 --> 06:08.190]  Nothing's bugging you.
[06:08.190 --> 06:09.190]  Everything is right.
[06:09.190 --> 06:10.190]  So Iry.
[06:10.190 --> 06:13.230]  So make sure you're checking out the Instagram is where I'm headed with all of this.
[06:13.230 --> 06:16.430]  We have added the Instagram store to Instagram.
[06:16.430 --> 06:18.510]  You can get an Iry Army t-shirt.
[06:18.510 --> 06:20.630]  You can get your Grow From Your Heart podcast hats there.
[06:20.630 --> 06:22.110]  It makes it super easy.
[06:22.110 --> 06:28.830]  Also every Monday, I do an Instagram live there on that exact Iry Genetics Instagram
[06:28.870 --> 06:29.870]  live feed.
[06:29.870 --> 06:33.710]  Monday at 710-ish PM Mountain Time.
[06:33.710 --> 06:34.710]  I'm in Colorado.
[06:34.710 --> 06:35.710]  I go on Mountain Time.
[06:35.710 --> 06:36.710]  I don't know where you are.
[06:36.710 --> 06:37.710]  You've got to adjust.
[06:37.710 --> 06:39.830]  But 7 PM Mountain Time.
[06:39.830 --> 06:42.030]  It's about 710, 715.
[06:42.030 --> 06:46.950]  I try to get going about 710, but sometimes the internet is kind of not cool and sometimes
[06:46.950 --> 06:47.950]  Instagram fights me.
[06:47.950 --> 06:48.950]  It takes a couple tries.
[06:48.950 --> 06:49.950]  We'll get it going.
[06:49.950 --> 06:50.950]  We'll be there every Monday.
[06:50.950 --> 06:53.710]  I haven't missed a Monday in a really long time, years probably.
[06:53.710 --> 06:56.190]  So every Monday around 710, we go live on Instagram.
[06:56.190 --> 06:57.190]  I hang out.
[06:57.190 --> 06:58.190]  I take dabs.
[06:58.550 --> 07:02.310]  I listen to music and I basically answer the questions that are on the screen.
[07:02.310 --> 07:07.390]  People type in comments and I will answer politely, do my best to respond and answer
[07:07.390 --> 07:08.390]  all those questions.
[07:08.390 --> 07:11.390]  So join me on the Instagram for the Instagram live.
[07:11.390 --> 07:12.870]  Check out the Instagram store.
[07:12.870 --> 07:17.750]  I also want to send a big thank you to the people who helped me, encouraged me to get
[07:17.750 --> 07:19.190]  the store up on Instagram.
[07:19.190 --> 07:20.190]  You know who you are.
[07:20.190 --> 07:21.190]  Thank you for the nudge.
[07:21.190 --> 07:22.750]  Thank you for the encouragement, the help.
[07:22.750 --> 07:27.230]  Also a lot of people were telling me that I could get badges on Instagram live, which
[07:27.270 --> 07:31.390]  would allow me to monetize the Instagram live, which would be cool because I've been doing
[07:31.390 --> 07:32.390]  it for years.
[07:32.390 --> 07:35.630]  We get a lot of people in there and I do freely answer grow questions.
[07:35.630 --> 07:37.870]  If you ask a question, I do my best to answer it.
[07:37.870 --> 07:41.550]  Sometimes I give golden nuggets that are worth a million dollars and someone told me we could
[07:41.550 --> 07:46.710]  monetize it to where you could give me a dollar or $5 just by pushing a little button.
[07:46.710 --> 07:53.030]  Unfortunately, Instagram denied and rejected my application for those badges.
[07:53.030 --> 07:55.030]  They were like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[07:55.030 --> 07:56.450]  We don't want to let you do that.
[07:56.450 --> 07:57.450]  So I don't get none of that.
[07:57.450 --> 07:58.450]  They don't give me no bonuses.
[07:58.450 --> 07:59.810]  I don't get none of that stuff.
[07:59.810 --> 08:00.810]  But guess what?
[08:00.810 --> 08:02.770]  I'm still going to do the Instagram live, you guys.
[08:02.770 --> 08:04.290]  It's not going to change anything.
[08:04.290 --> 08:08.210]  Still free information, free knowledge, free hangouts, free vibes, free love, just because
[08:08.210 --> 08:10.570]  I do it for the love of the plants.
[08:10.570 --> 08:11.570]  Where are we?
[08:11.570 --> 08:12.570]  I do have notes.
[08:12.570 --> 08:13.570]  You guys, I told you I took dabs.
[08:13.570 --> 08:14.570]  I got blazed.
[08:14.570 --> 08:15.570]  Added the store.
[08:15.570 --> 08:16.570]  Thanks to the people that helped.
[08:16.570 --> 08:17.650]  Denied badges.
[08:17.650 --> 08:18.810]  Watch the Instagram live.
[08:18.810 --> 08:19.890]  Also follow the Instagram.
[08:19.890 --> 08:22.810]  There's an Instagram, irie underscore genetics is the seed company.
[08:22.810 --> 08:25.570]  I post a bunch of flower pictures.
[08:25.690 --> 08:28.370]  You'll see that I use creative hashtags to confuse Instagram so they don't know what
[08:28.370 --> 08:29.970]  I'm posting all the time.
[08:29.970 --> 08:34.050]  Also there is a grow from your heart podcast Instagram page.
[08:34.050 --> 08:35.050]  Check that one out.
[08:35.050 --> 08:39.730]  I do use hashtag GFYH podcast that will come into play in the future when we do other things.
[08:39.730 --> 08:42.450]  If you're using hashtag GFYH podcast, it may help you out.
[08:42.450 --> 08:45.410]  If you post anything podcast related, please do use that.
[08:45.410 --> 08:46.930]  That is probably on the screen.
[08:46.930 --> 08:47.930]  Which side is that going to be on?
[08:47.930 --> 08:49.890]  It's going to be turned around.
[08:49.890 --> 08:51.650]  It's going to be here or here, right?
[08:51.650 --> 08:52.650]  Booyah.
[08:52.650 --> 08:53.650]  Hashtag GFYH podcast.
[08:53.730 --> 08:56.010]  If I do both sides, I can't be wrong.
[08:56.010 --> 08:57.530]  All right, we're going to move forward.
[08:57.530 --> 08:59.530]  I do have a lot of questions here.
[08:59.530 --> 09:01.970]  Let's try to get to the good part of this podcast.
[09:01.970 --> 09:04.490]  Somebody's going to say the good part actually starts around nine minutes in.
[09:04.490 --> 09:06.690]  Oh, I love you guys.
[09:06.690 --> 09:08.530]  The podcast is free.
[09:08.530 --> 09:09.530]  Enjoy the free show.
[09:09.530 --> 09:14.810]  All right, this one came from the grow help tab on the iriegenetics.com website.
[09:14.810 --> 09:15.810]  That's right.
[09:15.810 --> 09:17.650]  iriegenetics.com has a website.
[09:17.650 --> 09:19.810]  Once you go there, you will find a grow help tab.
[09:19.810 --> 09:21.050]  It says grow help.
[09:21.050 --> 09:26.330]  When you click on that, we do ask you one, two, it's about 10 or 12 looking like questions.
[09:26.330 --> 09:29.210]  We ask you your strain, where you're growing, what kind of lights.
[09:29.210 --> 09:32.490]  I need some information so that I can help diagnose the problems in your growth.
[09:32.490 --> 09:36.570]  Then at the bottom of this questionnaire, we do give you an opportunity to explain the
[09:36.570 --> 09:39.530]  problem or ask the question which is happening.
[09:39.530 --> 09:42.810]  This question came from the grow help tab, came from our friend Adam.
[09:42.810 --> 09:45.010]  Adam wants us to call him Adam on the podcast.
[09:45.010 --> 09:48.330]  He's growing several strains indoors under LED lighting.
[09:48.330 --> 09:50.170]  He's in veg, he's growing in soil.
[09:50.290 --> 09:51.290]  A lot of details here.
[09:51.290 --> 09:52.290]  We don't need some of these.
[09:52.290 --> 09:59.610]  Let's talk about, we do need to know pH of the last feeding, 6-4, daytime temp 78, nighttime
[09:59.610 --> 10:01.370]  temp 73.
[10:01.370 --> 10:03.690]  He does not give me the humidity in these questions.
[10:03.690 --> 10:05.290]  I'm going to set that page aside.
[10:05.290 --> 10:06.570]  There's a note on there I need for later.
[10:06.570 --> 10:10.650]  We're going to move forward to page two, the grow help question, the problem.
[10:10.650 --> 10:12.290]  That's what it says here.
[10:12.290 --> 10:13.290]  Cloning problems.
[10:13.290 --> 10:15.210]  I take my clones from healthy mothers.
[10:15.210 --> 10:16.210]  That's always a good start.
[10:16.330 --> 10:20.770]  I always water the day before cutting clones and I'm always sterile.
[10:20.770 --> 10:21.810]  Sounds like you're off to a good start.
[10:21.810 --> 10:25.170]  You guys clean up your cloning area when you're taking clones.
[10:25.170 --> 10:30.290]  Think of it as like if you got your finger cut off, you could bring your finger to me
[10:30.290 --> 10:33.130]  and your hand and you could throw them down on this table and you could say, bro, can
[10:33.130 --> 10:34.130]  you stitch my finger up?
[10:34.130 --> 10:37.450]  I could, but I've been taking dabs at this table.
[10:37.450 --> 10:39.570]  I may have eaten Thai food at this table recently.
[10:39.570 --> 10:43.370]  This table may not be the cleanest place for me to reattach your finger.
[10:43.370 --> 10:47.850]  You may want a more clean, sterile, sanitary type environment.
[10:47.850 --> 10:48.850]  Think about that when you're cutting clones.
[10:48.850 --> 10:51.970]  You're cutting their arms off, you're cutting their legs off and you're trying to make them
[10:51.970 --> 10:53.530]  grow into fresh, healthy parts.
[10:53.530 --> 10:54.610]  Let's be clean.
[10:54.610 --> 10:58.090]  So our friend says, I always try to be sterile.
[10:58.090 --> 10:59.330]  That is a very good way to start.
[10:59.330 --> 11:01.250]  That is a good practice to teach.
[11:01.250 --> 11:04.930]  So always cut clones in that clean, sterile environment if and when possible, as clean
[11:04.930 --> 11:05.930]  as possible.
[11:05.930 --> 11:08.770]  And you'll also use clean, sterile equipment.
[11:08.770 --> 11:11.150]  Everybody's getting a hop latent viroid.
[11:11.150 --> 11:15.390]  They're passing around this virus and it can move from plant to plant via your scissors.
[11:15.390 --> 11:19.350]  So clean your scissors all the time right now is something we should talk about.
[11:19.350 --> 11:21.630]  That's like fucking plant COVID, plant AIDS.
[11:21.630 --> 11:25.350]  I'll get somebody who's more qualified to talk about hop latent viroid.
[11:25.350 --> 11:27.270]  I'm honestly not qualified to talk about that.
[11:27.270 --> 11:28.270]  That's a virus.
[11:28.270 --> 11:31.030]  I need a more qualified school educated person for that.
[11:31.030 --> 11:34.670]  If you're smart enough, not smart enough, educated enough to come talk about that, let
[11:34.670 --> 11:35.670]  me know.
[11:35.670 --> 11:36.670]  We'll get you on the show somehow.
[11:36.670 --> 11:38.070]  I do got another microphone.
[11:38.070 --> 11:39.430]  We're going to talk about that in the future.
[11:39.430 --> 11:40.750]  Shout out to our buddy, White Mike.
[11:41.350 --> 11:42.590]  I'm going to get back on track.
[11:42.590 --> 11:46.510]  It says I have an at least 95% success rate.
[11:46.510 --> 11:50.430]  The problem is once my clone or my clones always look like shit and most of the time
[11:50.430 --> 11:53.310]  they go into flower and re-veg.
[11:53.310 --> 11:54.910]  That right there is a main key.
[11:54.910 --> 11:58.870]  That's a main hint that tells me that they're not getting enough light.
[11:58.870 --> 12:01.510]  Your light cycle is not on long enough.
[12:01.510 --> 12:03.390]  Are they under 24 hours of light?
[12:03.390 --> 12:05.710]  Put your light on 24 hours.
[12:05.710 --> 12:06.750]  Maybe get it closer.
[12:06.750 --> 12:09.110]  Maybe get more light, but they're not getting enough light.
[12:09.110 --> 12:11.990]  They want 24 hours of light to get these clones going.
[12:11.990 --> 12:13.550]  That would help you out.
[12:13.550 --> 12:14.950]  I don't know your light schedule.
[12:14.950 --> 12:19.310]  We did not include that in the question, so I don't have any data to work with there,
[12:19.310 --> 12:21.670]  but my first guess is more light, dude.
[12:21.670 --> 12:22.670]  Longer light cycle.
[12:22.670 --> 12:26.910]  We will do a podcast on DLI here coming up.
[12:26.910 --> 12:27.910]  Where are we?
[12:27.910 --> 12:29.750]  They go into flower and re-veg.
[12:29.750 --> 12:31.310]  Most of the time they go into flower and re-veg.
[12:31.310 --> 12:34.310]  Yeah, if you give them more light, they won't go into flower.
[12:34.310 --> 12:35.310]  That should work.
[12:35.310 --> 12:37.750]  All of my leaves turn yellow and get crispy.
[12:37.750 --> 12:43.750]  That is either overfeed, underfeed, or improper humidity.
[12:43.750 --> 12:45.190]  I don't have a reading on your humidity.
[12:45.190 --> 12:46.590]  I'm looking at this paper again.
[12:46.590 --> 12:50.910]  It says, I always get nice and healthy roots, but it takes forever to get them to snap back
[12:50.910 --> 12:52.470]  and turn healthy again.
[12:52.470 --> 12:56.750]  This is the same for mothers that I cut from clone or from seed.
[12:56.750 --> 13:04.830]  I use an OxyCloner with Hormax or Clonex pH to 5.8-ish.
[13:04.830 --> 13:05.830]  I've said this before.
[13:05.830 --> 13:06.830]  I'll say it again.
[13:06.910 --> 13:09.190]  Your meter doesn't have an ish on it.
[13:09.190 --> 13:10.550]  Your meter puts out numbers.
[13:10.550 --> 13:14.230]  Your number on the meter isn't 5.8-ish.
[13:14.230 --> 13:15.830]  What's the number on the meter, buddy?
[13:15.830 --> 13:18.550]  That's what you should have typed right there.
[13:18.550 --> 13:19.550]  That's going to tell me a lot.
[13:19.550 --> 13:23.270]  It says, I use a humidifier to keep the humidity up in the 70% range.
[13:23.270 --> 13:26.150]  Any pointers would be very appreciated.
[13:26.150 --> 13:29.770]  It sounds like you might ... What is the ... I want to know.
[13:29.770 --> 13:32.290]  You can message me back because there are things I want to know in here.
[13:32.290 --> 13:38.570]  What is the PPMs or the EC of the solution in the OxyCloner?
[13:38.570 --> 13:39.570]  What else did you put in there?
[13:39.570 --> 13:43.730]  You got Hormax or Clonex pH to 5.8.
[13:43.730 --> 13:44.730]  What's your EC?
[13:44.730 --> 13:45.730]  What's your PPMs?
[13:45.730 --> 13:50.050]  How much of that Hormax or Clonex are you putting in there?
[13:50.050 --> 13:51.730]  Then how hot is that water?
[13:51.730 --> 13:55.650]  That water could be getting too hot or that water could be getting too cold, which doesn't
[13:55.650 --> 13:58.090]  sound likely because you're getting the roots.
[13:58.090 --> 14:01.450]  I really think you need more light.
[14:01.450 --> 14:04.370]  I want to know how much of your solution you're using.
[14:04.370 --> 14:07.370]  Honestly, I think the first thing I'm going to say, you said they're vegging.
[14:07.370 --> 14:09.770]  They're going into flower and reveg, which is a light issue.
[14:09.770 --> 14:11.410]  That's what does that.
[14:11.410 --> 14:13.130]  Feed them properly and get them light.
[14:13.130 --> 14:15.890]  Make sure that the water in that cloner is nice and cool.
[14:15.890 --> 14:17.890]  That'll help you out a lot.
[14:17.890 --> 14:19.650]  70% humidity range.
[14:19.650 --> 14:23.890]  That's going to help you, but in my experience, when I'm using the cloners like that, humidity
[14:23.890 --> 14:27.170]  isn't super critical to be real high.
[14:27.250 --> 14:31.490]  It's more important to keep that water pH and properly nutrient.
[14:31.490 --> 14:36.090]  Keep in mind now, you're using an aero cloner that's bubbling constantly or if it's getting
[14:36.090 --> 14:37.610]  too hot, here's something you can do.
[14:37.610 --> 14:39.410]  We got two things of thought to think about.
[14:39.410 --> 14:41.850]  Now, if it's getting too hot, give it downtime.
[14:41.850 --> 14:42.850]  Let it turn off.
[14:42.850 --> 14:48.970]  Let it bubble for 15 or for 50 minutes, maybe 45, then give it 15 to 10 minutes off to cool
[14:48.970 --> 14:49.970]  down.
[14:49.970 --> 14:53.650]  The other thing I was going to say, it's constantly bubbling or almost constantly bubbling.
[14:53.650 --> 14:54.650]  You're making bubbles.
[14:54.650 --> 14:57.130]  You're putting water through movement.
[14:57.130 --> 15:01.210]  You're putting air into the water, which is going to create a lot of evaporation.
[15:01.210 --> 15:05.610]  When the water evaporates, the nutrients that are salts do not evaporate.
[15:05.610 --> 15:08.930]  Those salts are staying there in your reservoir, in the base.
[15:08.930 --> 15:10.930]  The water is evaporating.
[15:10.930 --> 15:14.810]  Now your PPMs, your EC and your pH are all going to fluctuate.
[15:14.810 --> 15:19.450]  You're going to have to check that on a daily basis, sometimes on a twice daily basis, depending
[15:19.450 --> 15:24.690]  on the size of the machine, your temperature, how much your plants are eating, how much
[15:24.690 --> 15:28.050]  water is being eaten, how much is evaporating.
[15:28.050 --> 15:29.050]  Check that.
[15:29.050 --> 15:32.770]  Check the pH, the EC, the TDS of that water frequently.
[15:32.770 --> 15:35.370]  You're setting it up and you're saying it's at five, eight right now.
[15:35.370 --> 15:37.170]  That's legit on day one.
[15:37.170 --> 15:41.450]  By day two, day three, it's gone up or it's gone down some direction.
[15:41.450 --> 15:43.890]  Check the temperature also.
[15:43.890 --> 15:45.450]  Those are things that I really think will help you out.
[15:45.450 --> 15:50.290]  I don't have a definitive answer because I don't have enough definitive data.
[15:50.290 --> 15:55.050]  Feel free, please do send me more data and I will again respond and try to get you more
[15:55.050 --> 15:56.050]  feedback.
[15:56.050 --> 15:57.050]  All right.
[15:57.050 --> 15:59.570]  Big thanks to our friend Adam for the great clone question.
[15:59.570 --> 16:01.010]  I do appreciate it.
[16:01.010 --> 16:04.630]  Let's keep moving because I do have another great question here in front of me.
[16:04.630 --> 16:08.610]  This one came from my email at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[16:08.610 --> 16:10.530]  Please do send me your questions.
[16:10.530 --> 16:12.450]  It says, hi Rasta Jeff.
[16:12.450 --> 16:13.450]  What's up bro?
[16:13.450 --> 16:14.450]  Good to meet you.
[16:14.450 --> 16:15.810]  This is from our friend Canadian Mike.
[16:15.810 --> 16:19.210]  Big up to our friend Canadian Mike up there north of the border.
[16:19.210 --> 16:24.290]  It says, big respect for all of your hard work, your seeds, your breeding and your podcast,
[16:24.290 --> 16:25.290]  bro.
[16:25.290 --> 16:29.530]  Then it also says, hopefully one day soon a drum solo.
[16:29.530 --> 16:31.050]  Many of you do know that I'm a podcaster.
[16:31.050 --> 16:34.010]  A lot of you may know by now that I'm a breeder and I do make seeds.
[16:34.010 --> 16:35.330]  I'm iRee Genetics, of course.
[16:35.330 --> 16:37.410]  We talked about that.
[16:37.410 --> 16:38.850]  But you might not know that I'm a drummer.
[16:38.850 --> 16:41.250]  I've played drums since I was 15.
[16:41.250 --> 16:43.170]  I'm approaching 43 at this point.
[16:43.170 --> 16:46.130]  I don't say that very often on the show, but I've been playing the drums for a minute.
[16:46.130 --> 16:47.810]  I can read and write music.
[16:47.810 --> 16:48.810]  Understand that.
[16:49.410 --> 16:50.690]  I'm not going to whip out a drum solo.
[16:50.690 --> 16:54.930]  There are videos from 2008 on YouTube if you search hard enough.
[16:54.930 --> 16:56.930]  All right, but bro, you're very welcome.
[16:56.930 --> 16:57.930]  Thank you for the love.
[16:57.930 --> 17:01.170]  Thank you for the respect and appreciation and the compliments.
[17:01.170 --> 17:02.770]  There is a lot to this one.
[17:02.770 --> 17:04.450]  It says, first, here's my setup.
[17:04.450 --> 17:06.850]  I only grow regular or feminized.
[17:06.850 --> 17:08.130]  I've never tried autos.
[17:08.130 --> 17:09.130]  I'm an old hippie.
[17:09.130 --> 17:10.130]  That's cool.
[17:10.130 --> 17:11.810]  I don't really mess with the auto flowers either.
[17:11.810 --> 17:14.890]  There's a couple of reasons why I like the regulars.
[17:14.890 --> 17:17.890]  That's regs, fems, or that's photos is what we're trying to say here.
[17:17.970 --> 17:20.170]  There's a reason why I like the photo periods.
[17:20.170 --> 17:21.170]  Regs or fems don't matter to me.
[17:21.170 --> 17:23.010]  I can work with both.
[17:23.010 --> 17:28.210]  It says, I've got quite a few four by eight flower, veg, mother, clone, seedling, mother,
[17:28.210 --> 17:29.210]  and dry tents.
[17:29.210 --> 17:32.890]  I do a lot of pheno hunting in very small plants.
[17:32.890 --> 17:36.810]  I'm using 750 liter nursery bags.
[17:36.810 --> 17:39.090]  Those nursery bags are about the size of a solo cup.
[17:39.090 --> 17:43.490]  That's what I imagine when you said 750, 0.750 liters.
[17:43.490 --> 17:44.810]  I did read that wrong.
[17:44.810 --> 17:46.890]  I read it right, said it wrong.
[17:46.890 --> 17:51.930]  Then it says, I use the paper towel method for 24 to 48 hours until roots show.
[17:51.930 --> 17:57.410]  Then in Jiffy Pucks with 24 to zero hours of light, 24 on, zero off.
[17:57.410 --> 18:03.810]  After seven days, 12-12 in the nursery bags filled with cocoa only at 400 PPFD.
[18:03.810 --> 18:06.370]  That's photosynthetic photon flux density.
[18:06.370 --> 18:08.810]  Up to 900 PPFD near the end of flower.
[18:08.810 --> 18:10.810]  No CO2, RIMO nutrients.
[18:10.810 --> 18:14.090]  I grow 16 or 25 plants per four by four square.
[18:14.090 --> 18:15.090]  That is a great setup.
[18:15.090 --> 18:16.850]  I miss those days, dude.
[18:16.850 --> 18:19.770]  You guys, I did go really fast over a lot of those.
[18:19.770 --> 18:23.250]  It's not going to be important for some of the questions coming up, but some of you will
[18:23.250 --> 18:25.330]  understand and appreciate those details.
[18:25.330 --> 18:26.330]  I get it.
[18:26.330 --> 18:31.330]  Growing 16 to 25 plants per four by four, depending on the strain, the width, lanky
[18:31.330 --> 18:32.330]  branches.
[18:32.330 --> 18:34.490]  I cut most of the sides off to get only a few most of the time.
[18:34.490 --> 18:36.050]  I love this style.
[18:36.050 --> 18:40.210]  If we weren't limited by numbers here, I would grow this style in my personal home
[18:40.210 --> 18:41.210]  grow.
[18:41.210 --> 18:46.290]  Back in the day, allegedly, before I was known, before people knew who I was and what I was
[18:46.730 --> 18:51.250]  doing, we may have done stuff similar to this in home grows and we may have crushed it.
[18:51.250 --> 18:52.890]  It may have been a cool idea.
[18:52.890 --> 18:55.970]  Also a great way to breed because you can fit a lot of phenotypes in there and you can
[18:55.970 --> 18:59.330]  see a lot of things and you can breed a lot of things and it really speeds you up.
[18:59.330 --> 19:00.330]  All right.
[19:00.330 --> 19:01.810]  It says, where am I?
[19:01.810 --> 19:05.850]  So I'm doing it so I can maximize real estate and have a full canopy like Scroggers, but
[19:05.850 --> 19:06.850]  without a net.
[19:06.850 --> 19:07.850]  Yes, I totally understand.
[19:07.850 --> 19:10.330]  It's a sea of green instead of a screen of green.
[19:10.330 --> 19:13.170]  He did throw out the letters, a SOG, so he understands.
[19:13.170 --> 19:17.090]  Now it does say my question and I've been rambling for a long time, so I'm glad we got
[19:17.090 --> 19:18.090]  to this part.
[19:18.090 --> 19:22.290]  It says, my question, since these are small pots, they're 12 to 20 inches, do I get our
[19:22.290 --> 19:24.930]  plants that are 12 to 20 inches?
[19:24.930 --> 19:29.730]  Do I get the full expression of the plant regarding effects, aroma and taste?
[19:29.730 --> 19:32.490]  Just like a normal veg and fully grown plant.
[19:32.490 --> 19:34.050]  I only grow for the effect.
[19:34.050 --> 19:35.730]  The rest are just bonuses.
[19:35.730 --> 19:38.890]  Big cheers from Canadian Mike.
[19:38.890 --> 19:40.490]  Canadian Mike, this is a great question.
[19:40.490 --> 19:42.090]  Big cheers back at you, brother.
[19:42.090 --> 19:47.290]  I like this because this is how I like the testers that I give out to be ran.
[19:47.290 --> 19:50.050]  I give a lot of test seeds out to people.
[19:50.050 --> 19:52.610]  A lot of people have been asking about being testers also, by the way.
[19:52.610 --> 19:57.010]  If you want to be a tester, there is an episode of this podcast, the Grow From Your Heart
[19:57.010 --> 19:59.650]  podcast, it is titled Testers.
[19:59.650 --> 20:00.650]  Listen to that.
[20:00.650 --> 20:03.610]  Once you've listened to that, then follow the appropriate steps after that.
[20:03.610 --> 20:05.110]  You'll have to send me an email.
[20:05.110 --> 20:09.610]  You will also be required and requested to join my Discord server and join the tester
[20:09.610 --> 20:10.610]  tab.
[20:10.610 --> 20:14.810]  If you're already testing for me and you're not posting pictures in the Discord tester
[20:14.810 --> 20:16.250]  tab, please do that.
[20:16.250 --> 20:17.250]  I would appreciate it.
[20:17.250 --> 20:19.850]  That's how you get more test seeds in the future.
[20:19.850 --> 20:23.170]  That's where all of the testing will be kept and done and journaled and documented and
[20:23.170 --> 20:25.610]  highlighted.
[20:25.610 --> 20:26.810]  That is how I like to do the testers.
[20:26.810 --> 20:30.770]  I like small plants because why are we going to run gigantic plants if we don't know if
[20:30.770 --> 20:32.490]  they're any good?
[20:32.490 --> 20:35.850]  Like you're saying, I don't think we need big ass plants.
[20:35.850 --> 20:37.570]  You're asking if we're going to see the full expression.
[20:37.570 --> 20:39.730]  I think so, yes, in my opinion.
[20:39.890 --> 20:43.810]  I've grown a lot of plants in cups.
[20:43.810 --> 20:44.810]  I do that.
[20:44.810 --> 20:45.930]  That's how I test brand new shit.
[20:45.930 --> 20:48.770]  Like I said, let's say I just made a brand new batch of seeds.
[20:48.770 --> 20:52.250]  I don't want to grow it in a 10 gallon pot and get it fucking 10 feet tall and spend
[20:52.250 --> 20:57.530]  six months on it to find out that it's a male or it's intersex or it's trash.
[20:57.530 --> 21:02.090]  I want to grow a bunch of plants in small pots in a small space just like this guy and
[21:02.090 --> 21:03.810]  see what I've created.
[21:03.810 --> 21:08.130]  So I would do, I had a tray that would hold 24 cups beautifully.
[21:08.530 --> 21:09.970]  24, 28, it doesn't matter.
[21:09.970 --> 21:11.570]  It holds them perfectly.
[21:11.570 --> 21:13.530]  Once I got the tray out and set it up, I would remember quickly.
[21:13.530 --> 21:14.530]  I think it's 24.
[21:14.530 --> 21:16.130]  I could fit 24 cups in this tray.
[21:16.130 --> 21:18.330]  I could fit two of those under a light beautifully.
[21:18.330 --> 21:19.890]  That's 48 seedlings.
[21:19.890 --> 21:23.650]  I would veg them tiny, flower them out, see what they do.
[21:23.650 --> 21:25.370]  Then I would keep the best out of those.
[21:25.370 --> 21:30.170]  I would reveg those and grow them again or I just let them go and redo more seeds.
[21:30.170 --> 21:33.690]  But what I have done is I've grown the same thing in little cups and in big pots and I've
[21:33.690 --> 21:36.050]  seen the similar results.
[21:36.050 --> 21:40.090]  They show you the same thing and honestly, in my experience, what I've noticed and what
[21:40.090 --> 21:45.810]  other growers will probably agree with, those big giant plants become more problematic,
[21:45.810 --> 21:51.810]  more prone to problems, more prone to pests, pathogens, diseases, issues.
[21:51.810 --> 21:52.810]  You got to prop them up.
[21:52.810 --> 21:54.810]  They start falling over.
[21:54.810 --> 21:55.970]  They get more problematic.
[21:55.970 --> 21:57.010]  That's the bottom line right there.
[21:57.010 --> 22:00.770]  The smaller, younger plants, you don't get as much time to fuck up.
[22:00.770 --> 22:03.210]  The less time you're on the road, the longer you have to crash.
[22:03.210 --> 22:05.810]  So go faster, get to the finish line.
[22:06.570 --> 22:08.730]  So let me get back on my notes because I do have notes written here.
[22:08.730 --> 22:12.870]  In my experience, in my opinion, you will see that full expression.
[22:12.870 --> 22:14.130]  Those hormones are going to develop.
[22:14.130 --> 22:16.890]  The things are going to happen just like they need to.
[22:16.890 --> 22:17.890]  You'll see those plants.
[22:17.890 --> 22:23.330]  In my experience, the small plants, if I were going to enter a competition for buds to see
[22:23.330 --> 22:28.970]  who grows the best buds photogenic wise, flavor, aroma, potency, overall cannabis cup winning
[22:28.970 --> 22:31.090]  weed, I would not grow giant plants.
[22:31.090 --> 22:35.090]  I would grow small to medium sized plants and I'd grow several of them is the way I
[22:35.090 --> 22:37.770]  would prefer to do that.
[22:37.770 --> 22:43.210]  I feel like they spend less energy on growing, less energy on supporting themselves, on beefing
[22:43.210 --> 22:44.210]  up.
[22:44.210 --> 22:46.890]  They've got so much energy already in that small seedling.
[22:46.890 --> 22:47.890]  They're ready to go.
[22:47.890 --> 22:49.170]  We do provide light and all that shit.
[22:49.170 --> 22:51.890]  But I mean, I just think they have more energy.
[22:51.890 --> 22:52.890]  They get better.
[22:52.890 --> 22:57.570]  They focus more on bud development, potency, flavor, the things that we want when we're
[22:57.570 --> 23:01.850]  not trying to make them gigantic and make them support themselves and be branches.
[23:01.850 --> 23:03.890]  I just think they're better smaller, honestly.
[23:03.890 --> 23:08.770]  So in my honest opinion, my experience, I would prefer smaller plants.
[23:08.770 --> 23:11.810]  I don't know that I would always go with the tiny nursery pots.
[23:11.810 --> 23:15.290]  I may go just the one step above that, like a one gallon.
[23:15.290 --> 23:18.890]  But if your plants are making you happy, it sounds like you're doing a great job.
[23:18.890 --> 23:20.250]  It sounds like you're a great person.
[23:20.250 --> 23:21.250]  You can make decisions.
[23:21.250 --> 23:22.530]  I think you've got the right idea.
[23:22.530 --> 23:26.650]  And the bottom line, I do think if you're growing them properly, giving them their love
[23:26.650 --> 23:29.570]  and care, you're mentioning how much PPFD you're giving them.
[23:29.570 --> 23:30.770]  You talked about nutrients.
[23:30.770 --> 23:35.530]  I would assume with that many details in this note that your plants are getting very close
[23:35.530 --> 23:37.650]  to their maximum potential.
[23:37.650 --> 23:41.710]  And you'll learn more very quickly because I can tell that you're a very curious and
[23:41.710 --> 23:43.050]  intelligent person.
[23:43.050 --> 23:44.690]  Big cheers, my friend Canadian Mike.
[23:44.690 --> 23:45.890]  It's an honor and a pleasure to meet you.
[23:45.890 --> 23:49.810]  I do look forward to future correspondence with you, my friend, because that was a great
[23:49.810 --> 23:50.810]  question.
