[00:17.020 --> 00:19.580]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:19.580 --> 00:21.520]  It's time for episode number 207
[00:21.520 --> 00:23.220]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.220 --> 00:27.000]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.000 --> 00:28.140]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.140 --> 00:29.260]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.260 --> 00:31.640]  if you're a news smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.640 --> 00:32.940]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:32.940 --> 00:34.380]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.380 --> 00:36.260]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.260 --> 00:39.460]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.460 --> 00:41.300]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.300 --> 00:43.180]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.180 --> 00:45.300]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.300 --> 00:47.060]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.060 --> 00:49.420]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.420 --> 00:51.220]  Big shout out to Kat, Coop,
[00:51.220 --> 00:53.540]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.660 --> 00:58.340]  Yeah, I hope everyone is feeling as good as I am.
[00:58.340 --> 00:59.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am smoking
[00:59.740 --> 01:01.900]  some Lemon Jeffrey Ambrosia
[01:01.900 --> 01:04.560]  from my friends at Apothecary Extracts.
[01:04.560 --> 01:06.940]  This is some amazing concentrate.
[01:06.940 --> 01:09.060]  The Ambrosia is their live resin line.
[01:09.060 --> 01:11.660]  They call it Ambrosia to differentiate themselves,
[01:11.660 --> 01:13.820]  to separate themselves from the market.
[01:13.820 --> 01:15.660]  Their Ambrosia line is always delicious.
[01:15.660 --> 01:20.260]  It's kind of a sappy, real terpy, live resin product.
[01:20.260 --> 01:21.980]  It is delicious, it's fairly priced,
[01:21.980 --> 01:23.060]  it gets me well medicated.
[01:23.060 --> 01:25.300]  This Lemon Jeffrey tastes so good, you guys.
[01:25.300 --> 01:28.220]  It almost smells like a scented candle in the room.
[01:28.220 --> 01:29.700]  Sorry for the abrupt drop in music there.
[01:29.700 --> 01:31.420]  I'll explain that here in just a second.
[01:31.420 --> 01:33.940]  It kind of smells like a lemon candle in the room
[01:33.940 --> 01:35.860]  or like some lemon heads in a package.
[01:35.860 --> 01:37.740]  The aroma is so overwhelming.
[01:37.740 --> 01:40.620]  And then when you take a dab, it just coats your mouth.
[01:40.620 --> 01:42.820]  That lemon candy flavor just coats your mouth.
[01:42.820 --> 01:44.660]  And then you get this amazing,
[01:44.660 --> 01:48.060]  like a freaking just a head high that you could not believe.
[01:48.060 --> 01:50.020]  It makes it hard to think, it makes it hard to focus,
[01:50.020 --> 01:51.380]  it makes everything cloudy.
[01:51.380 --> 01:53.340]  I freaking love it.
[01:53.340 --> 01:55.860]  Big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Extracts.
[01:55.860 --> 01:57.500]  Great work on this Lemon Jeffrey.
[01:57.500 --> 01:59.380]  I picked this up at Elevation,
[01:59.380 --> 02:01.780]  or maybe it's called Elevations in Colorado Springs.
[02:01.780 --> 02:04.000]  It is a medical only dispensary.
[02:04.000 --> 02:05.800]  They are on Razorback Road.
[02:05.800 --> 02:08.740]  Check them out, let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[02:08.740 --> 02:09.740]  Call before you drive
[02:09.740 --> 02:12.460]  because they don't always have Lemon Jeffrey.
[02:13.100 --> 02:15.260]  I buy a lot of it as soon as it goes on sale
[02:15.260 --> 02:17.320]  and people buy it up because I talk about it a lot.
[02:17.320 --> 02:18.860]  So make sure you call
[02:18.860 --> 02:21.500]  before you go to Elevation in Colorado Springs.
[02:21.500 --> 02:23.100]  Also, you can check out the Apothecary store
[02:23.100 --> 02:24.820]  in Colorado Springs while you're there.
[02:24.820 --> 02:26.860]  They're not too far apart.
[02:26.860 --> 02:28.800]  All right, so I turned down the music really quickly.
[02:28.800 --> 02:30.920]  Let me explain something about that.
[02:30.920 --> 02:32.900]  Holy shit, I came home from work
[02:32.900 --> 02:35.740]  and my little recording area,
[02:35.740 --> 02:39.060]  my recording table had a nice puddle of water all over it.
[02:39.060 --> 02:42.340]  Luckily, this oil slick pad has saved so much bullshit.
[02:43.180 --> 02:44.020]  One time the email came on
[02:44.020 --> 02:45.500]  while the coil was sitting on the table
[02:45.500 --> 02:46.700]  and it heated up the oil slick pad,
[02:46.700 --> 02:48.380]  it did not burn the table.
[02:48.380 --> 02:51.240]  This time I had a roof leak.
[02:51.240 --> 02:54.540]  So there's a chandelier just above my table where I record.
[02:54.540 --> 02:58.900]  And there have been fucking thunderstorms, you guys.
[02:58.900 --> 03:01.620]  Rainstorms, hailstorms, thunderstorms for the past month.
[03:01.620 --> 03:03.420]  I'm sure you've heard me talk about it on the podcast.
[03:03.420 --> 03:06.020]  We've had random power outages.
[03:06.020 --> 03:08.780]  The wifi and cable have been out a lot lately.
[03:08.780 --> 03:10.260]  It's been kind of sketchy
[03:10.260 --> 03:12.500]  trying to rely on electricity and wifi,
[03:12.500 --> 03:13.820]  but the rain has been here
[03:13.820 --> 03:15.260]  and it knocked some shit off my roof.
[03:15.260 --> 03:16.540]  It fucked up my roof a little bit.
[03:16.540 --> 03:19.380]  And I had a little bit of water getting in my house.
[03:19.380 --> 03:20.980]  So I planned on recording yesterday.
[03:20.980 --> 03:23.080]  I could not do it because my table,
[03:23.080 --> 03:25.420]  my recording area was all wet.
[03:25.420 --> 03:27.540]  Dude, I am a completely lucky man.
[03:27.540 --> 03:28.820]  Thank Jah.
[03:28.820 --> 03:29.980]  I am blessed.
[03:29.980 --> 03:32.260]  Usually this computer that I'm recording with right now
[03:32.260 --> 03:33.700]  is sitting directly in front of me,
[03:33.700 --> 03:35.980]  which is directly under the chandelier.
[03:35.980 --> 03:38.700]  I leave it here sometimes if I'm doing something.
[03:38.700 --> 03:40.700]  For some reason, I took it in the grow room
[03:40.700 --> 03:43.300]  because I was looking up some, a grow chart from something.
[03:43.300 --> 03:45.900]  I wanted to see some stuff and I had it in the grow room
[03:45.900 --> 03:47.800]  and I left it on the shelf in the grow
[03:48.820 --> 03:51.580]  and it did not get wet, you guys.
[03:51.580 --> 03:53.780]  I got so fucking lucky.
[03:53.780 --> 03:55.180]  My computer did not get wet.
[03:55.180 --> 03:57.500]  There was a puddle of water about,
[03:57.500 --> 03:58.920]  I don't know, I can reach,
[03:58.920 --> 04:00.620]  I can put one hand where the water was
[04:00.620 --> 04:02.380]  and I can completely reach my mixing board.
[04:02.380 --> 04:06.580]  I've got a 14 channel Mackie 1402 VLC3 mixer here.
[04:06.580 --> 04:08.580]  This is an expensive fucking piece of equipment.
[04:09.420 --> 04:11.420]  Right underneath that is a Livewire Power Furman.
[04:11.420 --> 04:12.940]  It's a power conditioner.
[04:12.940 --> 04:14.100]  It keeps all my power smooth
[04:14.100 --> 04:16.100]  so that I don't get power fluctuations in my equipment
[04:16.100 --> 04:17.700]  because that will burn out my recording gear.
[04:17.700 --> 04:20.260]  Underneath that is a DBX compressor.
[04:20.260 --> 04:21.660]  It's a kind of expensive piece of gear.
[04:21.660 --> 04:23.420]  That's what keeps all the background noise out of the show.
[04:23.420 --> 04:25.580]  It's what makes me sound crispy and clean.
[04:25.580 --> 04:26.940]  It's what limits me so that if I yell
[04:26.940 --> 04:29.500]  into the microphone real bad, it doesn't blow up your ears.
[04:29.500 --> 04:31.340]  It did get louder, but it didn't blow out
[04:31.340 --> 04:32.740]  because I was actually really much louder
[04:32.740 --> 04:33.720]  than what you heard.
[04:33.720 --> 04:35.560]  Also, I'm snapping my fingers
[04:35.560 --> 04:36.780]  to the right and left of the microphone.
[04:36.780 --> 04:39.180]  You don't hear that shit because of the compressor.
[04:39.180 --> 04:43.380]  Then underneath that is a Tascam US 1200, which is a USB.
[04:43.380 --> 04:46.020]  It makes all of my audio signal become a digital signal
[04:46.020 --> 04:47.580]  which runs into my MacBook.
[04:47.580 --> 04:49.980]  None of that shit got wet, you guys.
[04:49.980 --> 04:52.580]  Oh my God, I'm so lucky.
[04:52.580 --> 04:53.420]  I'm blessed.
[04:53.420 --> 04:56.380]  Thank Jah, whatever you believe in, thank that for me
[04:56.380 --> 04:57.660]  because all my shit could have been destroyed.
[04:57.660 --> 04:59.100]  That's thousands of dollars worth of equipment
[04:59.100 --> 05:00.420]  that could have been fucking ruined.
[05:00.420 --> 05:03.180]  Also, I had a bunch of hash on the table.
[05:03.180 --> 05:04.740]  You heard me talk about going to Apothecary
[05:04.740 --> 05:06.780]  and buying a bunch of concentrates.
[05:06.780 --> 05:09.840]  For some reason, all of the water went the other way.
[05:09.840 --> 05:12.700]  My e-mail and a Hitman rig and a bunch of concentrates
[05:12.700 --> 05:15.560]  were sitting on the table and the water went to the left
[05:15.560 --> 05:17.340]  and my shit was to the right.
[05:17.340 --> 05:18.640]  Something was looking out for me.
[05:18.640 --> 05:20.620]  It's fucked up I got water in my house,
[05:20.620 --> 05:23.340]  but something was fucking looking out for me.
[05:23.340 --> 05:27.440]  So with all of that talk about the water in the house,
[05:27.440 --> 05:29.320]  in my recording area, this means that I'm going
[05:29.320 --> 05:30.380]  to have contractors here.
[05:30.380 --> 05:31.380]  I'm gonna have roofers here.
[05:31.380 --> 05:32.540]  There were roofers here today.
[05:32.540 --> 05:33.880]  There were people in the crawl space.
[05:33.920 --> 05:35.040]  There were people in the attic.
[05:35.040 --> 05:36.100]  Shit was going on.
[05:37.620 --> 05:39.240]  I have been doing two episodes a week.
[05:39.240 --> 05:41.280]  I've been doing the Thursday episodes that are long
[05:41.280 --> 05:43.840]  and these Monday episodes that are regular length
[05:43.840 --> 05:47.040]  until I get my roof fixed and my recording area
[05:47.040 --> 05:48.040]  cleaned up and figured out.
[05:48.040 --> 05:50.160]  I cannot promise you two episodes a week.
[05:50.160 --> 05:53.760]  I will do my absolute best to give you one episode a week.
[05:53.760 --> 05:56.200]  I will still bring you my Monday episodes,
[05:56.200 --> 05:58.000]  but the Thursday episodes may disappear
[05:58.000 --> 06:01.120]  just until I get this recording area fixed.
[06:01.120 --> 06:03.320]  It's stressful trying to get this all set up
[06:04.200 --> 06:05.480]  I don't know that it's gonna rain again.
[06:05.480 --> 06:07.100]  If it rains again, the water's gonna come pouring
[06:07.100 --> 06:08.980]  through there because the roof is not fixed.
[06:08.980 --> 06:10.540]  So when I get done recording,
[06:10.540 --> 06:12.440]  I move all of my shit off this area
[06:12.440 --> 06:14.040]  and I cover up what I can't carry
[06:14.040 --> 06:16.320]  because some of the stuff's heavy and some of it's bulky.
[06:16.320 --> 06:17.940]  So I cover it with trash bags
[06:17.940 --> 06:20.180]  and I'm dealing with a fucking roof leak.
[06:20.180 --> 06:23.880]  So I apologize for maybe not putting out Thursday episodes.
[06:23.880 --> 06:24.720]  I may do it.
[06:24.720 --> 06:25.820]  It just depends on how shit goes.
[06:25.820 --> 06:27.720]  I may have contractors here.
[06:27.720 --> 06:29.280]  My house may be a fucking mess.
[06:29.280 --> 06:31.260]  I may be going somewhere else to record.
[06:31.260 --> 06:32.680]  I don't want to promise anything.
[06:33.040 --> 06:34.040]  I cannot deliver.
[06:34.040 --> 06:36.140]  So I apologize in advance.
[06:36.140 --> 06:38.260]  If I skip a Thursday episode or two,
[06:38.260 --> 06:40.060]  I will put out a Monday episode.
[06:40.060 --> 06:41.160]  Even if it's just me saying,
[06:41.160 --> 06:43.060]  hey, what's up fuckers, I apologize.
[06:43.060 --> 06:44.620]  I will come and do that for you.
[06:44.620 --> 06:46.620]  So that's my disclaimer on Thursday.
[06:46.620 --> 06:47.780]  That's what's going on in my world.
[06:47.780 --> 06:48.860]  There was a fucking roof leak.
[06:48.860 --> 06:49.680]  It'll get handled.
[06:49.680 --> 06:50.540]  It's not a big deal.
[06:50.540 --> 06:51.980]  It's just gonna disrupt some shit
[06:51.980 --> 06:54.820]  for an undetermined amount of time.
[06:54.820 --> 06:57.380]  It's nothing out of my pocket, nothing like that.
[06:57.380 --> 06:59.700]  It's all insurance and homeowner crap.
[06:59.700 --> 07:01.860]  It's just bullshit to deal with.
[07:02.040 --> 07:04.000]  I'm actually really lucky because nothing got destroyed.
[07:04.000 --> 07:05.800]  I got water in the kitchen.
[07:05.800 --> 07:07.640]  It was on the dining room table and on the kitchen floor.
[07:07.640 --> 07:08.560]  I got tile in here.
[07:08.560 --> 07:09.800]  I got a good table.
[07:09.800 --> 07:11.040]  It could have been much fucking worse.
[07:11.040 --> 07:11.880]  It was stressful.
[07:11.880 --> 07:14.480]  It was scary, but it's not that bad.
[07:14.480 --> 07:15.400]  All right, I'm gonna move on from that.
[07:15.400 --> 07:16.240]  I feel like I've been talking about that
[07:16.240 --> 07:17.240]  for a long fucking time.
[07:17.240 --> 07:18.060]  I'm sorry.
[07:18.060 --> 07:18.900]  It's been on my mind.
[07:18.900 --> 07:20.920]  Thank you for letting me rant about it and release it.
[07:20.920 --> 07:21.740]  I feel better.
[07:21.740 --> 07:22.580]  I really do.
[07:22.580 --> 07:23.420]  It was stressing me the fuck out.
[07:23.420 --> 07:25.220]  You guys, a roof leak in your home.
[07:25.220 --> 07:26.360]  You think that your house is where
[07:26.360 --> 07:27.400]  you can put all your shit.
[07:27.400 --> 07:28.280]  You work hard for things.
[07:28.280 --> 07:29.120]  I work hard for things.
[07:29.120 --> 07:30.440]  I imagine everybody out there,
[07:30.440 --> 07:31.940]  there are a few thieves and fucking scumbags,
[07:31.940 --> 07:33.940]  fuck a thief, but there are people out there
[07:33.940 --> 07:35.580]  that work hard for their shit.
[07:35.580 --> 07:37.620]  And then you get a nice home to put your shit in
[07:37.620 --> 07:39.300]  and you feel like your home is a secure place
[07:39.300 --> 07:41.060]  for your belongings and to come home
[07:41.060 --> 07:42.540]  and find your shit wet.
[07:42.540 --> 07:44.740]  Oh, that's a heartbreaking feeling.
[07:44.740 --> 07:45.580]  It made my chest sink.
[07:45.580 --> 07:47.440]  I walked in the house and I could hear water.
[07:47.440 --> 07:48.940]  And I was like, there's not water
[07:48.940 --> 07:50.220]  that should be running in that
[07:50.220 --> 07:51.860]  where that sound is coming from.
[07:51.860 --> 07:53.340]  It kind of fucked with me.
[07:53.340 --> 07:55.580]  All right, you guys, thanks for being my therapist.
[07:55.580 --> 07:57.260]  Thanks for letting me get that off my shoulders.
[07:57.260 --> 07:58.140]  I feel a lot better.
[07:58.140 --> 08:00.640]  This is not just going to be a therapeutic podcast.
[08:00.640 --> 08:03.100]  I do have some emails and stuff I would like to read.
[08:03.100 --> 08:06.120]  But before I get there, let me do a couple of quick things.
[08:06.120 --> 08:08.000]  I would like to tell you guys about Patreon
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.240]  or I guess I'd like to remind you about Patreon
[08:10.240 --> 08:12.480]  because I talk about it all the time.
[08:12.480 --> 08:13.760]  For those of you who haven't heard,
[08:13.760 --> 08:15.360]  and if you're not already tired of hearing about it,
[08:15.360 --> 08:18.040]  Patreon is a service that would allow you as a listener
[08:18.040 --> 08:20.420]  to financially contribute to the podcast.
[08:20.420 --> 08:21.840]  That's right, if you feel like this podcast
[08:21.840 --> 08:23.600]  was worth a dollar or two of your time,
[08:23.600 --> 08:27.080]  you can go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[08:27.080 --> 08:29.100]  All of the info that you need will be right there.
[08:29.100 --> 08:31.560]  You can sign up, you can contribute to the podcast,
[08:31.560 --> 08:33.620]  you can sign up for a one-time contribution,
[08:33.620 --> 08:36.340]  you can sign up for a monthly contribution, it is up to you.
[08:36.340 --> 08:38.420]  You can contribute as little as $1.
[08:38.420 --> 08:40.800]  And I honestly don't think there's a minimum or a maximum
[08:40.800 --> 08:43.060]  on how many nines or zeros you can put in there.
[08:43.060 --> 08:45.500]  So test it out, put in a whole bunch of nines,
[08:45.500 --> 08:46.820]  see what goes on.
[08:46.820 --> 08:48.660]  And I'm not trying to get rich on podcasting, you guys.
[08:48.660 --> 08:49.580]  Don't think I'm trying to become
[08:49.580 --> 08:51.300]  a millionaire off of podcasting.
[08:51.300 --> 08:54.340]  What I'm trying to do is offset the cost of my web hosting.
[08:54.340 --> 08:55.700]  It costs me a little bit of money
[08:55.700 --> 08:58.200]  to have a website where I host the podcast,
[08:58.200 --> 08:59.920]  and I pay for that out of my pocket.
[08:59.920 --> 09:00.880]  I'm not trying to get rich,
[09:00.880 --> 09:02.680]  I just want help covering that cost.
[09:02.680 --> 09:03.720]  If you guys don't wanna cover it,
[09:03.720 --> 09:07.160]  and if you can't help me, I don't mind covering it myself.
[09:07.160 --> 09:08.880]  But I'd rather not.
[09:08.880 --> 09:10.720]  I put in a little bit of work, I put in some time.
[09:10.720 --> 09:11.960]  If you guys wanna throw down a buck or two
[09:11.960 --> 09:13.620]  to help me pay for that, I would appreciate it.
[09:13.620 --> 09:14.760]  I'm gonna quit begging,
[09:14.760 --> 09:16.000]  but I want you to know that it is there.
[09:16.000 --> 09:16.840]  Several people were like,
[09:16.840 --> 09:18.560]  hey man, I'd love to send you a buck or two.
[09:18.560 --> 09:20.540]  PayPal will not accept donations
[09:20.540 --> 09:23.440]  because I have the word cannabis in my podcast.
[09:24.440 --> 09:26.660]  I say the word cannabis all the time.
[09:26.660 --> 09:27.980]  We talk about ganja.
[09:27.980 --> 09:30.660]  My website has the word cannabis in it.
[09:30.660 --> 09:32.980]  So they do not want anything to do with me.
[09:32.980 --> 09:34.100]  So I had to find another service.
[09:34.100 --> 09:36.140]  Patreon is the best way to do it.
[09:36.140 --> 09:38.300]  Patreon, you contribute to Patreon.
[09:38.300 --> 09:40.060]  Patreon sends the money to my PayPal.
[09:40.060 --> 09:42.300]  It's just a little buffer zone, helps me out.
[09:43.260 --> 09:44.300]  And I wanna send a huge thank you
[09:44.300 --> 09:46.180]  to everybody who has contributed to Patreon.
[09:46.180 --> 09:49.100]  If you've sent me $1, or if you've sent me a lot of dollars,
[09:49.100 --> 09:51.700]  every dollar matters, and I completely appreciate it.
[09:51.760 --> 09:54.200]  And also, if you cannot contribute to Patreon
[09:54.200 --> 09:56.720]  and you're listening to the podcast, don't feel bad.
[09:56.720 --> 09:58.680]  This podcast is free for everybody.
[09:58.680 --> 10:01.300]  There are a few people out there that can contribute.
[10:01.300 --> 10:02.140]  They will cover you.
[10:02.140 --> 10:03.720]  Don't worry, this podcast is free.
[10:03.720 --> 10:04.560]  I get it.
[10:04.560 --> 10:06.240]  Not everybody can throw down money for a podcast.
[10:06.240 --> 10:07.360]  That's why I'm doing it for free.
[10:07.360 --> 10:10.040]  I want you to spend the money on your garden.
[10:10.040 --> 10:11.880]  Don't stress, just keep listening.
[10:11.880 --> 10:13.880]  And I still love everybody equally.
[10:13.880 --> 10:14.760]  All right, I'm gonna move on
[10:14.760 --> 10:16.400]  because I feel like I'm ranting about Patreon
[10:16.400 --> 10:17.500]  for way too long.
[10:17.500 --> 10:19.720]  Let me remind you about my social media.
[10:19.720 --> 10:22.620]  On Twitter, you can find me under at GFYH podcast.
[10:22.620 --> 10:24.420]  I would love the interaction there.
[10:24.420 --> 10:26.740]  On Facebook, it's the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[10:26.740 --> 10:28.020]  Just give that a search.
[10:28.020 --> 10:29.540]  Also, I've got an Instagram.
[10:29.540 --> 10:31.580]  I would love it if you followed me on Instagram.
[10:31.580 --> 10:34.380]  Search for Irie underscore genetics.
[10:34.380 --> 10:37.960]  Irie, I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[10:37.960 --> 10:39.020]  That's my seed company.
[10:39.020 --> 10:39.860]  I'm a seed breeder.
[10:39.860 --> 10:42.460]  I make regular and feminized cannabis seeds.
[10:42.460 --> 10:44.980]  They're available at thedankteam.com.
[10:44.980 --> 10:46.680]  I cannot ship you anything personally.
[10:46.680 --> 10:48.420]  I do not send seeds to anybody.
[10:48.440 --> 10:50.360]  If you're here in Colorado, hit me up.
[10:50.360 --> 10:53.100]  I may have some gifts or trades available for you.
[10:53.100 --> 10:54.480]  All right, where was I?
[10:54.480 --> 10:56.480]  I feel like I am rambling on Instagram.
[10:56.480 --> 10:58.480]  That's right, Irie underscore genetics.
[10:58.480 --> 11:00.380]  A lot of people ask me what Irie means.
[11:00.380 --> 11:02.080]  Irie is just the best you could feel.
[11:02.080 --> 11:03.660]  You know that feeling when you're sitting under a tree
[11:03.660 --> 11:06.040]  on a sunny day and it's just the right temperature,
[11:06.040 --> 11:07.720]  the wind's kind of blowing, it feels real good,
[11:07.720 --> 11:10.600]  your hair's blowing back, not hitting you in the eyes.
[11:10.600 --> 11:12.240]  Maybe you got your best friend next to you.
[11:12.240 --> 11:13.520]  Maybe your dog's with you.
[11:13.520 --> 11:15.520]  The grass is that nice, cool feeling.
[11:15.520 --> 11:17.040]  You know when the grass feels good to sit in,
[11:17.040 --> 11:18.120]  it's nice and cold.
[11:18.820 --> 11:19.660]  Maybe you don't have no shoes on.
[11:19.660 --> 11:21.220]  Maybe you're smoking a little joint
[11:21.220 --> 11:22.880]  and that feeling when you're just like, damn,
[11:22.880 --> 11:24.340]  I wouldn't rather be anywhere else.
[11:24.340 --> 11:25.660]  Everything is cool.
[11:25.660 --> 11:26.740]  That is Irie.
[11:26.740 --> 11:28.320]  That is just feeling Irie.
[11:28.320 --> 11:29.620]  There are a lot of versions of Irie,
[11:29.620 --> 11:31.140]  but right now that's the one we're gonna go with,
[11:31.140 --> 11:33.120]  just feeling Irie, feeling good.
[11:34.740 --> 11:36.060]  All right, let's get me back on track.
[11:36.060 --> 11:37.660]  I am super blazed from this lemon, Jeffrey.
[11:37.660 --> 11:39.380]  I am rambling my face off.
[11:39.380 --> 11:41.700]  Also, if you are not into the social media
[11:41.700 --> 11:43.260]  and you would like to contact me,
[11:43.260 --> 11:44.860]  I would love to hear from you through email.
[11:44.860 --> 11:47.940]  You can email me at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[11:48.760 --> 11:51.440]  That goes directly to my phone, to my iPad, to my computer.
[11:51.440 --> 11:52.600]  I won't miss it.
[11:52.600 --> 11:54.320]  I'll get your email that way.
[11:54.320 --> 11:56.080]  Also, I would love iTunes comments.
[11:56.080 --> 11:58.080]  You guys, if you listen to the podcast on iTunes,
[11:58.080 --> 12:00.240]  I would love it if you go to the iTunes store,
[12:00.240 --> 12:02.400]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[12:02.400 --> 12:04.280]  It's kind of toward the bottom.
[12:04.280 --> 12:06.440]  Click on the little icon with my face on it.
[12:06.440 --> 12:07.600]  Then in the middle of the screen,
[12:07.600 --> 12:09.680]  there's a section that says ratings and reviews.
[12:09.680 --> 12:12.000]  Click on that and then go leave me a rating and a review.
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.240]  So far, everybody has left a five-star rating.
[12:14.240 --> 12:16.080]  Leave me as many stars as you feel I deserve.
[12:16.080 --> 12:17.220]  I would appreciate it.
[12:17.240 --> 12:18.280]  But if you type in a comment,
[12:18.280 --> 12:19.680]  let me know what you think of the show.
[12:19.680 --> 12:22.560]  I will read your comments on a future episode.
[12:22.560 --> 12:24.080]  It's almost time to do that again.
[12:24.080 --> 12:25.320]  I haven't done that in a few episodes,
[12:25.320 --> 12:26.440]  so that's coming up soon.
[12:26.440 --> 12:29.160]  So go sneak a comment in there before I get to it.
[12:29.160 --> 12:31.280]  All right, I do have several emails
[12:31.280 --> 12:32.640]  that I wanna read here on this episode,
[12:32.640 --> 12:34.160]  but I'm sure you can hear this thing in my throat.
[12:34.160 --> 12:35.920]  I'm not gonna try to clear my throat one last time.
[12:35.920 --> 12:37.000]  I'm just gonna press pause.
[12:37.000 --> 12:38.040]  I'm gonna take a drink.
[12:38.040 --> 12:39.280]  I'm going to take a dab.
[12:39.280 --> 12:42.080]  And then I will be back with an email about auto flowers.
[12:42.080 --> 12:44.240]  I've got an email with a nutrient question,
[12:44.240 --> 12:46.720]  and then we'll see how much time we've got left after that.
[12:47.220 --> 12:48.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, take a dab while I do,
[12:48.660 --> 12:49.860]  and I'll be right back.
[13:29.560 --> 13:31.720]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[13:31.720 --> 13:35.440]  I just took a gigantic dab of some strawberry, banana,
[13:35.440 --> 13:37.840]  high cannabinoid, full spectrum extract
[13:37.840 --> 13:39.980]  from Apothecary Extracts.
[13:39.980 --> 13:42.860]  And I am lit.
[13:42.860 --> 13:44.540]  I was a little bit cold a few minutes ago.
[13:44.540 --> 13:48.200]  It's a cold, rainy night, and I am currently sweating,
[13:48.200 --> 13:49.500]  and I wanna open the window.
[13:49.500 --> 13:50.840]  That was a great dab.
[13:50.860 --> 13:52.540]  So if it sounds like I'm lost
[13:52.540 --> 13:54.660]  for the next couple of seconds, it's because I am.
[13:54.660 --> 13:56.540]  I'm like a small child wandering around the mall,
[13:56.540 --> 13:58.540]  wondering where my fucking mom went right now.
[13:58.540 --> 13:59.440]  Holy shit.
[14:00.380 --> 14:02.180]  All right, before I took a break
[14:02.180 --> 14:04.720]  and took a dab that nearly erased my memory,
[14:04.720 --> 14:06.900]  I kinda remember I was teasing about an email
[14:06.900 --> 14:08.580]  I wanted to read, and I think it's the email
[14:08.580 --> 14:10.140]  that is here on my iPad screen.
[14:10.140 --> 14:12.140]  So I'm gonna read this email.
[14:12.140 --> 14:14.520]  I'm not sure if this person wants me to say their name.
[14:14.520 --> 14:16.460]  Shout out to the person that sent this to me.
[14:16.460 --> 14:17.900]  I appreciate the email.
[14:17.900 --> 14:18.740]  It goes like this.
[14:18.740 --> 14:19.860]  What's happening, Rasta Jeff?
[14:19.880 --> 14:23.360]  I'm about to drop an auto flower, Northern Lights Outdoors.
[14:23.360 --> 14:25.640]  We will be at 19 to 22 hours of sun
[14:25.640 --> 14:27.180]  for the next several months.
[14:27.180 --> 14:29.800]  I just listened to your outdoor growing podcast.
[14:29.800 --> 14:31.640]  Should I expect the same size plant
[14:31.640 --> 14:34.420]  in an auto versus a fem?
[14:34.420 --> 14:35.260]  Thank you.
[14:35.260 --> 14:36.080]  And then they signed their name,
[14:36.080 --> 14:38.280]  but I'm not gonna say it because I respect your privacy.
[14:38.280 --> 14:42.140]  So let's talk about your auto flower, Northern Lights.
[14:43.040 --> 14:44.240]  Unfortunately, no.
[14:44.240 --> 14:48.120]  Your outdoor auto flower plant is not going to do as well
[14:48.140 --> 14:51.300]  as your outdoor regular photo period plant.
[14:51.300 --> 14:53.020]  And that's what it's called is a photo period plant
[14:53.020 --> 14:55.980]  is what I would call it, a regular or a photo period.
[14:55.980 --> 14:58.020]  There are several reasons for that.
[14:58.020 --> 15:00.100]  Kind of mainly the reason,
[15:00.100 --> 15:03.060]  the way that the auto flower plant was bred and designed,
[15:03.060 --> 15:05.060]  it's not meant to get large.
[15:05.060 --> 15:07.900]  It's meant to grow to a certain size and then flower.
[15:07.900 --> 15:11.540]  Most of them, and let me give a quick disclaimer.
[15:11.540 --> 15:13.460]  I don't grow auto flower plants.
[15:13.460 --> 15:14.620]  That's not my thing.
[15:14.620 --> 15:17.200]  I really like regular plants.
[15:17.380 --> 15:18.940]  I've gotten away from feminized seeds.
[15:18.940 --> 15:21.900]  I just like regular old school, regular seeds,
[15:21.900 --> 15:24.580]  male, female, pollen, make seeds, grow that.
[15:24.580 --> 15:25.460]  That's what I like to do.
[15:25.460 --> 15:28.740]  But so the little that I do know about auto flowers,
[15:28.740 --> 15:30.660]  they're bred to grow to a certain height.
[15:30.660 --> 15:32.740]  Usually they get about three feet, two to three feet,
[15:32.740 --> 15:34.500]  depending on what strain you're fucking with.
[15:34.500 --> 15:35.820]  And I could be completely wrong,
[15:35.820 --> 15:38.520]  but from what I have seen and tried and done,
[15:38.520 --> 15:39.620]  the little experience I've got,
[15:39.620 --> 15:40.940]  the plant got to about three feet
[15:40.940 --> 15:42.740]  and then it started flowering.
[15:42.740 --> 15:45.900]  It took it about eight weeks to get to that height.
[15:45.900 --> 15:47.760]  And then it just started flowering all by itself.
[15:47.760 --> 15:48.760]  I didn't change the lights.
[15:48.760 --> 15:49.780]  I didn't change the nutrients.
[15:49.780 --> 15:50.880]  I didn't do anything.
[15:50.880 --> 15:53.360]  And then it took it about 55 days to finish flowering
[15:53.360 --> 15:54.200]  and it was done.
[15:54.200 --> 15:55.800]  And I wasn't satisfied with it.
[15:55.800 --> 15:57.840]  And I'll never fuck with an auto flower again.
[15:57.840 --> 15:59.380]  But the way that they're bred,
[15:59.380 --> 16:01.840]  there's something in it that triggers it to flower
[16:01.840 --> 16:04.680]  either based on its age or its height
[16:04.680 --> 16:06.200]  or whatever it decides.
[16:06.200 --> 16:08.200]  It will start flowering by itself.
[16:08.200 --> 16:11.680]  They are not meant to stay alive for a long time.
[16:11.680 --> 16:15.240]  A regular plant, a photo period plant,
[16:15.260 --> 16:16.980]  you can grow it as long as you want.
[16:16.980 --> 16:19.320]  The reason a lot of these plants get real big outdoors
[16:19.320 --> 16:21.220]  is because we start vegging them indoors.
[16:21.220 --> 16:23.060]  I'm sure you heard Jesse and I talk about
[16:23.060 --> 16:24.940]  setting up lights in January
[16:24.940 --> 16:26.580]  and starting your clones in January
[16:26.580 --> 16:28.740]  and getting them big so that when May comes,
[16:28.740 --> 16:30.860]  you've got a big four foot tall plant
[16:30.860 --> 16:32.980]  that's been topped a couple of times already.
[16:32.980 --> 16:34.000]  So that when you put it outside,
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.340]  it's already four feet tall.
[16:35.340 --> 16:37.020]  That's bigger than your auto flower plant
[16:37.020 --> 16:38.820]  is even going to get.
[16:38.820 --> 16:41.340]  So the quick straight answer is no.
[16:41.340 --> 16:43.400]  Your auto flower plant is not going to get
[16:43.400 --> 16:47.120]  anywhere near the size of a regular outdoor plant.
[16:47.120 --> 16:48.860]  If that's what you've got, that's what you've got.
[16:48.860 --> 16:51.500]  But next year, I would recommend working with regular plants.
[16:51.500 --> 16:53.900]  If you can get some seeds, grow them indoors,
[16:53.900 --> 16:55.720]  take some clones off of it, find the keeper,
[16:55.720 --> 16:57.700]  and then put that keeper outdoors next year
[16:57.700 --> 16:59.780]  is really what you should do.
[16:59.780 --> 17:00.780]  And I kind of got sidetracked,
[17:00.780 --> 17:03.340]  but the reason that the non auto flower,
[17:03.340 --> 17:05.500]  the regular flowering photo period plant
[17:05.500 --> 17:06.420]  is able to get bigger
[17:06.420 --> 17:08.580]  is because you control when it flowers.
[17:08.580 --> 17:11.340]  You can veg that thing until it's 22 feet tall
[17:11.340 --> 17:12.260]  if you really wanted to
[17:12.260 --> 17:14.280]  and you had the light and the space to do it.
[17:14.280 --> 17:16.240]  Those auto flower plants, if you're going to run those,
[17:16.240 --> 17:18.560]  I recommend planting a whole bunch of those
[17:18.560 --> 17:20.680]  because they're going to grow really quickly.
[17:20.680 --> 17:22.240]  They aren't going to have time to get real big
[17:22.240 --> 17:23.480]  and take up a lot of space.
[17:23.480 --> 17:24.860]  But if you plant a whole bunch of them
[17:24.860 --> 17:26.320]  and fill up your square footage,
[17:26.320 --> 17:29.400]  you'll still produce the amount of cannabis you could produce
[17:29.400 --> 17:31.760]  from a small personal outdoor grow.
[17:31.760 --> 17:33.360]  I'm not talking like a commercial grow
[17:33.360 --> 17:35.560]  or a big Humboldt County outdoor,
[17:35.560 --> 17:37.840]  but if you've got a small personal outdoor
[17:37.840 --> 17:40.120]  and you just pack in that space with auto flowers,
[17:40.120 --> 17:41.360]  you could produce as much
[17:41.380 --> 17:43.460]  as you could produce with one or two big plants.
[17:43.460 --> 17:46.780]  However, I have never been impressed or satisfied
[17:46.780 --> 17:49.740]  with the quality of an auto flower plant.
[17:49.740 --> 17:52.180]  I'm going to assume that your location there in Alaska,
[17:52.180 --> 17:54.320]  you're not going to get enough dark time
[17:54.320 --> 17:55.780]  to get a photo period plant.
[17:55.780 --> 17:57.780]  So the auto flowers are what you've got to do.
[17:57.780 --> 17:59.180]  So man, good luck.
[17:59.180 --> 18:01.260]  I hope it comes out well for you.
[18:01.260 --> 18:02.480]  I would love an email update,
[18:02.480 --> 18:04.500]  maybe some pictures on the progress
[18:04.500 --> 18:05.540]  so that I can see how it goes.
[18:05.540 --> 18:07.180]  And we'll talk more about it on the show.
[18:07.180 --> 18:08.560]  Hey, I appreciate the email.
[18:08.560 --> 18:09.400]  Thanks a lot.
[18:09.400 --> 18:11.900]  I hope to hear from you again in the future.
[18:11.900 --> 18:13.920]  Good luck with your auto flower out there.
[18:13.920 --> 18:16.160]  I hope that goes well.
[18:16.160 --> 18:17.660]  All right, I've got another email from a listener
[18:17.660 --> 18:19.000]  and it goes like this.
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.060]  Hey Jeff, I just picked up some of your firefly
[18:21.060 --> 18:24.860]  from the Dank team, super pumped on getting a few freebies.
[18:24.860 --> 18:27.520]  And then he goes on to list the names of those freebies
[18:27.520 --> 18:28.760]  that he got from the Dank team.
[18:28.760 --> 18:30.380]  And the best part is I did not name those.
[18:30.380 --> 18:32.820]  That those names are not anything I ever made up.
[18:32.820 --> 18:34.980]  I did not send that to the Dank team
[18:36.020 --> 18:37.460]  that they created those names.
[18:37.460 --> 18:39.520]  I would not have named them what you said.
[18:39.520 --> 18:40.720]  I'm pretty sure what you've got
[18:40.720 --> 18:43.360]  is a Lemon Jeffery cross to Arise.
[18:43.360 --> 18:45.760]  And the other seed pack that you've probably got
[18:45.760 --> 18:48.840]  is a Cookies and Cream cross to Arise.
[18:48.840 --> 18:49.880]  Those were some of the freebies
[18:49.880 --> 18:52.720]  that I sent to the Dank team for their orders.
[18:52.720 --> 18:54.460]  I'm pretty sure that's what you've got.
[18:54.460 --> 18:56.560]  If you'd like to know the names that I decided on
[18:56.560 --> 18:58.360]  or do decide on, send me an email.
[18:58.360 --> 19:00.560]  I'll let you know what those strains are really called
[19:00.560 --> 19:02.080]  if that's what you've got.
[19:02.080 --> 19:03.520]  I will also contact the Dank team
[19:03.520 --> 19:05.040]  and let them know to quit naming my shit
[19:05.040 --> 19:06.760]  because that is not cool.
[19:06.780 --> 19:09.340]  That is not Rasta Jeff approved.
[19:09.340 --> 19:10.540]  Yankee, don't do that shit bro.
[19:10.540 --> 19:12.140]  Message me, I'll tell you what to name them.
[19:12.140 --> 19:13.340]  You don't get to make up names.
[19:13.340 --> 19:14.580]  I do, I bred that shit.
[19:14.580 --> 19:15.420]  It's my product.
[19:15.420 --> 19:16.700]  All right, enough ranting about that.
[19:16.700 --> 19:17.700]  The email goes on like this.
[19:17.700 --> 19:19.500]  It says, here's a question that you may have covered
[19:19.500 --> 19:22.060]  in a previous podcast, but I'm a fairly new listener
[19:22.060 --> 19:24.640]  working my way back through old episodes.
[19:24.640 --> 19:25.940]  Dude, you're gonna love it
[19:25.940 --> 19:28.060]  because I've been putting out old episodes.
[19:28.060 --> 19:29.780]  iTunes and Stitcher only hold
[19:29.780 --> 19:31.140]  about a hundred episodes in the feed.
[19:31.140 --> 19:33.980]  So I've been putting up the old episodes in chunks.
[19:33.980 --> 19:36.920]  Most Thursdays I release long episodes.
[19:36.920 --> 19:38.480]  They're like three or four hours long
[19:38.480 --> 19:40.320]  and they're usually three or four episodes
[19:40.320 --> 19:42.880]  from the history, the archives.
[19:42.880 --> 19:44.300]  I'm putting them out in order.
[19:44.300 --> 19:45.680]  So hopefully you get to hear a bunch of those.
[19:45.680 --> 19:47.640]  I hope they help you out.
[19:47.640 --> 19:49.040]  Other listeners, let me know what you think
[19:49.040 --> 19:50.120]  of those long podcasts.
[19:50.120 --> 19:51.160]  Is that a waste of my time?
[19:51.160 --> 19:52.680]  Is it good for you?
[19:52.680 --> 19:53.800]  Is it doing anything?
[19:53.800 --> 19:54.640]  Can I quit doing that?
[19:54.640 --> 19:55.800]  Should I keep doing that?
[19:55.800 --> 19:56.640]  What do you think?
[19:56.640 --> 19:57.460]  How do you feel?
[19:57.460 --> 19:58.300]  Let me know.
[19:58.300 --> 20:00.520]  Also, I'm putting all the episodes up on YouTube.
[20:00.520 --> 20:02.760]  So there will be an archive on YouTube before too long.
[20:02.780 --> 20:04.980]  I've got about 42 of them made.
[20:04.980 --> 20:07.380]  I will not release them until I've got 50 up there
[20:07.380 --> 20:09.360]  and then you guys will be able to check them out.
[20:09.360 --> 20:11.500]  Anyway, I'm gonna keep going with this email.
[20:11.500 --> 20:13.660]  It says, I'm a fairly new listener working my way back
[20:13.660 --> 20:14.500]  through old episodes.
[20:14.500 --> 20:16.260]  How often do you water with nutrients?
[20:16.260 --> 20:18.860]  Every time, every other time.
[20:18.860 --> 20:19.680]  And then he goes on to say,
[20:19.680 --> 20:21.740]  the guys that taught me have me water in nutrients
[20:21.740 --> 20:23.140]  every time I water.
[20:23.140 --> 20:24.900]  I'll flush one day every other week
[20:24.900 --> 20:26.540]  and flush at the very end.
[20:26.540 --> 20:28.220]  And then he explains his setup.
[20:28.220 --> 20:31.360]  So let me talk a little bit about how much nutrients
[20:31.360 --> 20:33.700]  and how often to use nutrients.
[20:34.660 --> 20:36.780]  Most of this is gonna be based on your medium.
[20:36.780 --> 20:38.660]  This guy here who sent me the email,
[20:38.660 --> 20:41.660]  he says he's using Botanicare Moisture Cocoa.
[20:41.660 --> 20:45.520]  I would put some, a little bit of perlite or persolite
[20:45.520 --> 20:47.320]  in that cocoa to give it a little bit of air.
[20:47.320 --> 20:49.100]  It's a little bit of aeration would be nice.
[20:49.100 --> 20:51.300]  There may be some in the Botanicare Moisture Cocoa,
[20:51.300 --> 20:52.180]  I'm not sure,
[20:52.180 --> 20:55.100]  but I always like to add a little bit of perlite to my cocoa.
[20:55.100 --> 20:56.520]  I think it makes it fluffier.
[20:56.520 --> 20:57.860]  It makes it drain a little better.
[20:57.860 --> 20:58.980]  The plants like oxygen.
[20:58.980 --> 21:00.840]  It's always helpful.
[21:00.840 --> 21:04.260]  If you're using cocoa, it is okay to,
[21:04.260 --> 21:07.580]  it is recommended to water with nutrients every time.
[21:07.580 --> 21:10.260]  The nutrients do not hang out in the cocoa.
[21:10.260 --> 21:13.000]  They basically fall right out of the bottom of the pot
[21:13.000 --> 21:13.840]  with the water.
[21:13.840 --> 21:14.780]  They don't catch anything.
[21:14.780 --> 21:15.700]  They don't bind.
[21:16.620 --> 21:18.000]  There's nothing to stop it.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.020]  So you need to add nutrients every time
[21:20.020 --> 21:22.020]  when you're watering with cocoa.
[21:22.020 --> 21:24.020]  You're saying you said use the Mills line
[21:24.020 --> 21:26.740]  with reverse osmosis water, your hand watering,
[21:26.740 --> 21:28.940]  and you've got 12 two gallon plastic pots
[21:28.940 --> 21:30.200]  per four by four tray.
[21:30.540 --> 21:31.900]  Sounds like you're off to a good start.
[21:31.900 --> 21:35.220]  You got adjust a wing double enders and CO2 enrichment.
[21:35.220 --> 21:37.140]  You're pulling one and a half to two pounds of light,
[21:37.140 --> 21:39.640]  depending on the strain, which is good.
[21:39.640 --> 21:41.900]  You say they look a little fried toward the end.
[21:41.900 --> 21:43.580]  You might be pushing a little too much nutrient
[21:43.580 --> 21:45.060]  if they look a little fried toward the end,
[21:45.060 --> 21:47.860]  or you are probably, since you're using cocoa,
[21:47.860 --> 21:50.140]  you're probably flushing a little extra long
[21:50.140 --> 21:51.700]  is gonna be my assumption.
[21:51.700 --> 21:54.380]  So let me go back on a couple of things you said here
[21:54.380 --> 21:55.500]  in the email.
[21:55.500 --> 21:57.100]  How often should I be using nutrients?
[21:57.100 --> 21:59.780]  Every other, every time, every other time.
[22:00.280 --> 22:02.640]  If you're using cocoa, I recommend using nutrients
[22:02.640 --> 22:04.740]  every single time.
[22:04.740 --> 22:06.840]  Like I said before, the nutrients don't hang out
[22:06.840 --> 22:08.740]  in the cocoa, so you're gonna need to replenish
[22:08.740 --> 22:09.920]  that every time.
[22:09.920 --> 22:13.280]  If you're growing in soil or a soilless mix,
[22:13.280 --> 22:15.560]  maybe like a peat based mix or something,
[22:15.560 --> 22:19.560]  I would only, I would reduce the frequency of feedings
[22:19.560 --> 22:22.680]  and water with just water maybe every other time.
[22:22.680 --> 22:25.000]  But that's for guys that are using soilless mix
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.200]  or soil or living soil.
[22:27.200 --> 22:28.480]  If you're using living soil,
[22:28.480 --> 22:29.400]  you've already got your shit in there.
[22:30.020 --> 22:31.140]  You don't need to add nutrients.
[22:31.140 --> 22:33.100]  If you're using bottled nutrients,
[22:33.100 --> 22:35.860]  I would say I feed Botanicare bottled nutrients.
[22:35.860 --> 22:37.820]  When I feed, if I'm using Botanicare,
[22:37.820 --> 22:39.700]  I feed once a week with the Botanicare.
[22:39.700 --> 22:42.220]  I mix the full lineup, whatever I'm using.
[22:42.220 --> 22:44.900]  It'll probably be base nutrients, cow mag,
[22:44.900 --> 22:45.900]  what else is in there?
[22:45.900 --> 22:48.900]  Liquid karma, the hydroplex.
[22:48.900 --> 22:51.060]  Then I add a little bit of mammoth pea to that.
[22:51.060 --> 22:52.700]  Maybe a little Osa-28.
[22:52.700 --> 22:54.340]  But I will feed them all of that shit,
[22:54.340 --> 22:56.860]  whatever they're getting for the week, cow mag,
[22:56.860 --> 22:58.060]  whatever they're getting,
[22:58.080 --> 23:00.320]  whatever root supplement they're getting.
[23:00.320 --> 23:02.720]  They'll get all of that probably Monday.
[23:02.720 --> 23:04.120]  Then the next time they get fed,
[23:04.120 --> 23:06.040]  they're just gonna get plain water.
[23:06.040 --> 23:07.920]  And then if they need water again that week,
[23:07.920 --> 23:11.040]  I may give them a tea if it's the middle of flower.
[23:11.040 --> 23:12.440]  But if they get thirsty again,
[23:12.440 --> 23:13.800]  they'll probably just get water
[23:13.800 --> 23:14.960]  to hold them over until Monday.
[23:14.960 --> 23:17.400]  Usually my plants get watered twice a week.
[23:17.400 --> 23:19.560]  They're in seven gallon pots most of the time.
[23:19.560 --> 23:20.920]  They only need water twice.
[23:22.240 --> 23:23.920]  Also in your email, you said,
[23:23.920 --> 23:25.640]  oh, let me light up the iPad screen here again.
[23:25.640 --> 23:26.640]  It just blacked out on me
[23:26.640 --> 23:28.340]  because I haven't touched it in a minute.
[23:28.340 --> 23:30.580]  You said something about flushing that I wanna touch on.
[23:30.580 --> 23:32.300]  You said the guys that taught you
[23:32.300 --> 23:35.460]  have you water nutrients every time you water.
[23:35.460 --> 23:36.300]  That is correct.
[23:36.300 --> 23:37.460]  Do that since you're in cocoa.
[23:37.460 --> 23:40.360]  Then you say you flush one day every other week
[23:40.360 --> 23:42.200]  and flush at the end.
[23:42.200 --> 23:45.340]  I would skip the flushing one day every other week.
[23:45.340 --> 23:46.700]  That's not necessary.
[23:47.740 --> 23:48.820]  They are not getting to eat.
[23:48.820 --> 23:50.500]  You're cleaning out the soil.
[23:50.500 --> 23:52.660]  And until you feed with nutrients again,
[23:52.660 --> 23:53.740]  they are not eating.
[23:53.740 --> 23:55.620]  You could probably increase your weight
[23:55.620 --> 23:56.960]  if you did not do that.
[23:56.960 --> 23:57.800]  That's my opinion.
[23:57.800 --> 23:59.880]  Because that's one more chance they'll get to eat.
[23:59.880 --> 24:03.080]  Then you say you flush at the end.
[24:03.080 --> 24:04.440]  How long do you flush at the end?
[24:04.440 --> 24:06.840]  With cocoa, you can get away with 10 days.
[24:06.840 --> 24:08.420]  I would recommend 12 to 14.
[24:08.420 --> 24:11.000]  But with cocoa, you can totally get away with 10 days,
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.240]  especially if you're watering lightly.
[24:13.240 --> 24:16.400]  So for your situation, I would stop that flush
[24:16.400 --> 24:19.680]  and I would just feed nutrients every time you water.
[24:19.680 --> 24:22.040]  Now here are a couple of things to think about.
[24:22.940 --> 24:25.400]  You can water with nutrients every time.
[24:26.140 --> 24:28.220]  I would do a base nutrient every time.
[24:28.220 --> 24:31.000]  Then your additives, here's something to consider.
[24:32.340 --> 24:35.820]  I, until recently, I would add all of my additives
[24:35.820 --> 24:37.580]  like I talked about on Monday
[24:37.580 --> 24:40.860]  and just pummel the plant with everything on Monday.
[24:40.860 --> 24:44.900]  Somebody has encouraged me to do different nutrient,
[24:44.900 --> 24:45.860]  we call it boosts.
[24:45.860 --> 24:49.100]  So I'll add my base nutrients every time I water the cocoa.
[24:49.100 --> 24:51.260]  But on Monday, I'll do my CalMag.
[24:51.260 --> 24:53.500]  On Tuesday, I'll do Epsom salts.
[24:53.520 --> 24:55.840]  On Wednesday, I'll do Plus Life.
[24:55.840 --> 24:57.960]  On Thursday, I'll add Push.
[24:57.960 --> 25:00.040]  On Friday, I add something,
[25:00.040 --> 25:01.440]  I'm not gonna tell you everything I add in there,
[25:01.440 --> 25:06.440]  but on Friday, I actually add the Apetite from New Millennium
[25:07.760 --> 25:09.440]  is what's been going in there lately.
[25:09.440 --> 25:12.160]  So I just add something different every day of the week
[25:12.160 --> 25:14.800]  so that that way I feel like I'm not overloading the plants.
[25:14.800 --> 25:16.160]  And that's something that's been taught to me
[25:16.160 --> 25:18.440]  by somebody else and I'm just trying it to see how it works
[25:18.440 --> 25:20.000]  because I'm open to new stuff.
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.240]  And honestly, I see great results with it.
[25:22.240 --> 25:25.540]  We do mix several things into the nutrient mix.
[25:25.540 --> 25:28.940]  We'll do Veg Bloom base, we'll do Plus Life in there,
[25:28.940 --> 25:30.500]  and then we'll put some fulvic acid
[25:30.500 --> 25:32.660]  and we'll put some, just a couple other things in there.
[25:32.660 --> 25:34.100]  But if we're gonna boost it up,
[25:34.100 --> 25:35.820]  like the CalMag and the Epsom salts,
[25:35.820 --> 25:37.740]  that stuff only happens once a week
[25:37.740 --> 25:38.780]  and not all in the same day.
[25:38.780 --> 25:40.700]  So you can think about that kind of stuff.
[25:40.700 --> 25:42.740]  But if you're using cocoa,
[25:42.740 --> 25:44.820]  I would certainly at least add a base nutrient
[25:44.820 --> 25:46.380]  every single time.
[25:46.380 --> 25:48.820]  You're gonna get a CalMag deficiency with cocoa.
[25:48.820 --> 25:50.620]  Then also in your message, you said at the end,
[25:50.620 --> 25:52.800]  they look a little bit fried.
[25:52.800 --> 25:54.240]  You might be flushing too long.
[25:54.240 --> 25:56.040]  If they're starting to yellow up,
[25:56.040 --> 25:58.180]  let's just say you're growing on a nine week cycle.
[25:58.180 --> 26:00.040]  You didn't tell me about your cycle.
[26:00.040 --> 26:03.040]  Let's just say you got a nine week flowering cycle.
[26:03.040 --> 26:05.600]  You're probably flushing at the end of week seven,
[26:05.600 --> 26:08.580]  the start of week eight to give yourself 14 days.
[26:08.580 --> 26:11.480]  I'm assuming around five to six days,
[26:11.480 --> 26:12.940]  maybe seven to eight days into that,
[26:12.940 --> 26:14.440]  they really start getting yellow.
[26:14.440 --> 26:16.520]  They start to turn kind of a goldish color,
[26:16.520 --> 26:18.040]  maybe a little bit of red in there.
[26:18.040 --> 26:19.640]  And the leaves get a little gray on the tips
[26:19.640 --> 26:21.340]  and they start crinkling up.
[26:21.340 --> 26:23.100]  You have just cleaned out all the nutrients.
[26:23.100 --> 26:25.520]  That cocoa doesn't hold anything.
[26:25.520 --> 26:28.480]  Nothing sticks to the cocoa like it does in a soilless mix.
[26:28.480 --> 26:29.900]  It just falls right out.
[26:29.900 --> 26:30.900]  So that's what's going on.
[26:30.900 --> 26:33.560]  You've probably just flushed and they're ready.
[26:33.560 --> 26:35.940]  What you could do is give a little more nutrients
[26:35.940 --> 26:36.980]  for a little bit longer
[26:36.980 --> 26:39.280]  and that way they won't burn out so quickly.
[26:39.280 --> 26:41.520]  And also you may get a little more weight,
[26:41.520 --> 26:43.460]  but there's nothing wrong with too long of a flush.
[26:43.460 --> 26:46.220]  That's gonna make them taste really good.
[26:46.220 --> 26:49.400]  All right, so I think I covered your question.
[26:50.480 --> 26:51.640]  If you're using cocoa,
[26:51.640 --> 26:53.700]  you should use nutrients every time you water.
[26:53.700 --> 26:55.920]  If you're using soil or a soilless mix,
[26:55.920 --> 26:58.820]  I would recommend nutrients and then water
[26:58.820 --> 27:01.200]  and then maybe a tea occasionally
[27:01.200 --> 27:03.460]  just because that will build up.
[27:03.460 --> 27:05.760]  And if you're using bottled nutrients in a soilless mix,
[27:05.760 --> 27:07.780]  the salts will build up quickly
[27:07.780 --> 27:10.480]  and then that'll start causing lockouts and problems
[27:10.480 --> 27:11.800]  and everything will go to shit.
[27:11.800 --> 27:13.860]  So, all right, I hope I answered your question.
[27:13.880 --> 27:16.960]  He ends the email by saying Killer Podcast
[27:16.960 --> 27:19.080]  and then they sign their name.
[27:19.080 --> 27:21.160]  I'm not sure if you want your name set on the podcast.
[27:21.160 --> 27:22.220]  No, actually I talked to you about it.
[27:22.220 --> 27:24.600]  You do not want your real name on the podcast.
[27:24.600 --> 27:27.280]  You said Cash McCoy is the business name.
[27:27.280 --> 27:29.440]  So big shout out to Cash McCoy.
