[00:00.000 --> 00:05.960]  Welcome back everybody. It's time for episode 384 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. This
[00:05.960 --> 00:10.040]  episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company. If you need new seeds for your
[00:10.040 --> 00:19.200]  garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:19.200 --> 00:22.520]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking. Today I've been
[00:22.520 --> 00:28.460]  taking dabs of Wi-Fi Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms. I picked this up at the Pueblo location.
[00:28.460 --> 00:36.780]  The label says it is 82.5% THC with a total of 95.7% total cannabinoids. I really enjoy
[00:36.780 --> 00:41.620]  this concentrate. I generally like to buy a concentrate that lifts me up and makes my
[00:41.620 --> 00:46.420]  head kind of spin and makes me super high. This Wi-Fi is the exact opposite. This was
[00:46.420 --> 00:50.300]  like a punch in the face. It made me sit back in the chair, made my eyes super heavy. It
[00:50.300 --> 00:54.740]  made my body nice and heavy. This is some chilling out medicine. This is some nighttime
[00:54.740 --> 00:58.340]  medicine. This is probably, if you've got some super heavy pain, this would probably
[00:58.340 --> 01:02.580]  knock your pain out. If you're just trying to get nice and stoned and nice and mellow,
[01:02.580 --> 01:07.140]  this would be a perfect get stoned and sink into the couch kind of concentrate. So big
[01:07.140 --> 01:12.860]  up to the Wi-Fi Ambrosia and a big shout out to our friends at Apothecary Farms in Pueblo.
[01:12.860 --> 01:17.560]  All right, podcast world. Last Thursday I had Mike on the show and we talked about the
[01:17.560 --> 01:23.060]  farm bill. Mike was super fired up and wanted to talk all night, so I left the microphones
[01:23.060 --> 01:27.860]  on. We kept talking for a really long time. I only posted the first 36 minutes of the
[01:27.860 --> 01:32.180]  conversation that Mike and I had last week, so this episode will be the remainder of that
[01:32.180 --> 01:35.940]  conversation. Before we get into the rest of the podcast, make sure you follow Mike
[01:35.940 --> 01:41.060]  on Twitter. It's at NemoPunk15. Also, make sure you support Mike on Facebook. Find his
[01:41.060 --> 01:46.660]  Facebook page. It is Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
[01:46.660 --> 01:50.380]  smokers and growers, let's welcome White Mike back to the show.
[01:50.380 --> 01:54.340]  We've got a very good friend who checks out my Instagram live feeds. He sends me some
[01:54.340 --> 01:57.380]  emails. He's a really good supporter of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. He's on the
[01:57.380 --> 02:04.600]  Irie Army. He asked us, what is a good way that he can support cannabis legalization
[02:04.600 --> 02:10.660]  in his area? He's kind of a businessy person. He needs to maintain anonymity. Say that word
[02:10.660 --> 02:15.820]  for me. Anonymity. Anonymity. Thank you. I've never tried to say that out loud.
[02:15.820 --> 02:20.260]  I didn't snap a picture of the comment because it was an Instagram live, but it was something
[02:21.140 --> 02:25.900]  to the effect of, how do I keep the corporate suit and tie job in a prohibition state and
[02:25.900 --> 02:29.820]  still fight to legalize cannabis? Yes.
[02:29.820 --> 02:44.180]  The answer is very carefully. I've been where you are now. I remember being in... It started,
[02:44.180 --> 02:50.300]  oddly enough, I pulled the fucking topic out of the hat in seventh grade debate. We
[02:50.300 --> 02:55.180]  did the class project where you write down a topic and throw it in the hat. Then you
[02:55.180 --> 03:00.460]  pull out the topic and you have to fucking debate whatever side of the argument you pull.
[03:00.460 --> 03:03.500]  Hold on, I'm dabbing. He's going to take a dab. I was just about
[03:03.500 --> 03:08.840]  to ask. You had a debate class in school. Was cannabis, you nod. Cannabis was the subject
[03:08.840 --> 03:10.620]  that you had to debate. Worse.
[03:10.700 --> 03:11.700]  Okay. Worse.
[03:11.700 --> 03:17.980]  I had to be the pro use marijuana while you're pregnant. That was my argument that I had
[03:17.980 --> 03:18.980]  to make.
[03:18.980 --> 03:21.500]  That's a whole nother podcast. I tried to get some ladies to come on the show and talk
[03:21.500 --> 03:24.500]  about that and nobody wanted to come on the show. Hey ladies, if you're out there and
[03:24.500 --> 03:27.420]  you'd like to be on a podcast, talk about using cannabis during pregnancy. Pros and
[03:27.420 --> 03:30.540]  cons. I'd like to find one lady who was pro and one lady who was con, and then maybe it
[03:30.540 --> 03:36.100]  was some medical profession that could come on and talk about that. Maybe, is that OBGYN?
[03:36.100 --> 03:38.820]  Is that who I need to talk about that? The pregnancy doctor? You want one of them to
[03:38.820 --> 03:43.420]  come on? Tell me what you think. They're going to say no, but still want their presence
[03:43.420 --> 03:46.900]  just for their voice. We'll CNN them. Every time they get gone, I'll just turn down their
[03:46.900 --> 03:50.700]  fucking mic like I do when Mike's coughing. Just like that. Just shut off his mic. There
[03:50.700 --> 03:54.420]  we go. Mike, I'm trying to ramble on because you're purple and you're sweaty and you're
[03:54.420 --> 03:57.820]  coughing, but eventually the listeners are going to catch on that. I'm just fucking talking
[03:57.820 --> 04:04.820]  out of my ass so that you can cough. Can you hear the words? Hard to talk.
[04:04.820 --> 04:09.020]  Oh, I don't have any clue what we were talking about just a couple of seconds ago. Oh, how
[04:09.020 --> 04:12.020]  to for our friend, how to, how to keep his job.
[04:12.020 --> 04:18.940]  I brought this story up is because I've been forced to debate this topic since long before
[04:18.940 --> 04:28.620]  I was comfortable with it. So take your time, bro. Take your time. I'm just trolling you.
[04:28.620 --> 04:31.300]  Like it wasn't a totally high story. The dab came at a bad time.
[04:31.300 --> 04:35.540]  He's really purple. He's really is purple. And that was a little dad too. I'm sorry.
[04:35.540 --> 04:40.100]  It was, I was worried about it being too cold because I've kind of gunked up the nail the
[04:40.100 --> 04:50.540]  night doing too cold. Went a little hot. But, uh, that first experience with debating cannabis
[04:50.540 --> 04:57.460]  taught me a couple of really useful things. One, the real trick to debating any topic
[04:57.460 --> 05:04.380]  is doing your research to, if you take a controversial topic and decide to stand up
[05:04.380 --> 05:10.220]  and talk about it, be prepared to get a lot of people laughing at you.
[05:10.220 --> 05:14.580]  And that's just something that you have to take from the first, um, like there's a famous
[05:14.580 --> 05:18.780]  quote. I don't, I think it's Gandhi or something. That's like, first they laugh at you or like
[05:18.780 --> 05:23.060]  first they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they fight you. Then you win. Um,
[05:23.060 --> 05:31.340]  but like the laughing's a long time usually. And if you go back to like, and there will
[05:31.340 --> 05:40.780]  always be laughers. Oh, for sure. But if you go back to like 96, um, 98, 2000 and look
[05:40.780 --> 05:48.300]  at how cannabis advocates, um, even advocates from like the national organization for the
[05:48.300 --> 05:54.940]  reform of marijuana laws, normal, when they're heavy hitting lawyers would go give press
[05:54.940 --> 05:59.620]  releases or put out statements or talk to the press, the anchor would be laughing in
[05:59.620 --> 06:05.220]  their face. And it's like, this is a lawyer. They have a degree from a good university.
[06:05.220 --> 06:10.660]  They have 20 years experience in their field. This is an educated, informed opinion. You're
[06:10.660 --> 06:17.420]  just laughing at them. But we've passed that point in history now. So even if like, as
[06:17.460 --> 06:22.060]  long as you're in the U S this is true. Um, depending on which country you're listening
[06:22.060 --> 06:26.660]  from, this might not be very true for you. Hopefully it's truer than it was 10 years
[06:26.660 --> 06:34.740]  ago. Um, but as far as the U S goes, if you start talking about pro legalization topics
[06:34.740 --> 06:42.100]  in an informed manner, you're not going to get met with laughter anymore. Um, you'll
[06:42.100 --> 06:49.140]  still get ignored and people will fight you, but the laughter is pretty much gone. And
[06:49.140 --> 06:56.540]  that's because a lot of what's not funny has been made abundantly clear over time, the
[06:56.540 --> 07:02.540]  disparities and arrest rates, um, what the black market is capable of doing with 30 or
[07:02.540 --> 07:11.820]  40 billion a year. Um, uh, it's an amount of money. That's almost inconceivable. Uh,
[07:11.820 --> 07:15.980]  there's a good, uh, meme going around. That's like the difference between a million seconds
[07:15.980 --> 07:21.460]  and a billion seconds. Like one's like 11 hours and the other one's like 30 days. Like
[07:21.460 --> 07:27.180]  I got all of those numbers wrong, but if you look it up, the disparity is huge and it's,
[07:27.180 --> 07:34.260]  it's so big that most people don't understand how big it is. And that amount of money in
[07:34.260 --> 07:42.180]  the black market, like the cosmetics industry, all makeup is only 35 billion. Um, it's huge.
[07:42.180 --> 07:47.620]  And all of that's underground. And the amount of people that employs, um, the amount of
[07:47.620 --> 07:53.660]  disputes that creates the amount of taxes that could get paid on all that. Like all
[07:53.660 --> 07:58.540]  of those are things that people kind of understand at least a little bit now. And when I started
[07:58.540 --> 08:03.660]  doing this, none of that shit existed. We didn't have the seed to sale model. We didn't have any
[08:03.660 --> 08:09.180]  of that stuff. We didn't have examples. Um, when we were talking about legalizing marijuana,
[08:09.180 --> 08:13.020]  five, six years ago here in Colorado, people were like, what does that look like?
[08:14.540 --> 08:17.500]  Blank stares were all anyone had. I mean, anyone in the room,
[08:18.380 --> 08:23.340]  the closest model we had was the, uh, medical marijuana dispensary models that were starting
[08:23.340 --> 08:29.580]  here and in California. Well, one of the biggest problems Callie's had this year is they ignored
[08:29.580 --> 08:39.740]  their medical market from 96 to like 2015. And in all that time, the market didn't ignore itself.
[08:40.460 --> 08:46.060]  It grew, evolved, changed, fell apart, got raided, rebuilt itself countless times.
[08:46.940 --> 08:52.300]  And now that they finally tried to settle down and regulate and license this whole
[08:52.300 --> 08:58.300]  kind of giant monster that they've ignored for 20 years, it's nearly impossible. Um,
[08:58.300 --> 09:02.540]  with all the grandfathering in and you know, how can this place not meet the new rules?
[09:02.540 --> 09:06.940]  They've been open for 20 years. The mayor was at their ribbon cutting. We love these people.
[09:06.940 --> 09:11.100]  How can they be illegal now? Right. There's a lot of that right now. And it all has to do with
[09:11.100 --> 09:18.300]  just ignoring it. And so the upside for people still living in prohibition land is by now,
[09:19.260 --> 09:26.060]  even in places like Arkansas, Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, there are already legislature,
[09:26.860 --> 09:33.260]  members of the legislature, the state Senate governors, um, city council people actively
[09:33.260 --> 09:39.660]  talking about marijuana legalization. Um, even the ones that are against it are currently thinking
[09:39.660 --> 09:47.660]  about if it happens anyway, how do we mitigate shit like DUIs and teen access? Um,
[09:48.300 --> 09:52.860]  advertising and stuff like that. And so they're already willing to have a conversation that they
[09:52.860 --> 09:57.980]  weren't willing to even think about five, seven years ago. Well, they know it's coming. It was,
[09:57.980 --> 10:00.780]  it's going to happen around them one day if they're ready for it or not.
[10:00.780 --> 10:07.660]  Yep. The other big upside to this is you're no longer the squeaky wheel. Like all of the
[10:07.660 --> 10:16.780]  wheels are squeaking 60 to 70% statistically. So, um, for someone who has a job that they want
[10:16.780 --> 10:24.060]  to protect or a life they want to protect, um, to send an email to an elected representative to say,
[10:24.060 --> 10:29.260]  hi, I'm a voter and I would like you to support the legalization of cannabis in one way or another,
[10:29.820 --> 10:37.420]  um, medical access, whatever the topic is in your area to send that email is not opening yourself up
[10:37.420 --> 10:45.260]  to any sort of blowback. Um, these people receive a million emails a month. Like the,
[10:45.260 --> 10:49.500]  the amount of correspondence they get from constituents and people around the country is
[10:49.500 --> 10:54.300]  just bananas. Make up another email address. If you don't want to use it's a hundred percent
[10:54.300 --> 11:00.620]  simple enough to create your own. Yep. And it's real easy to make it look like a legitimate human
[11:00.620 --> 11:07.580]  being when you're not, because there's not an investigative portion to sending your governor
[11:07.580 --> 11:12.140]  an email that says vote for legal cannabis. Now, if you send an email, that's like, I'm going to
[11:12.140 --> 11:16.860]  eat you and you know, tomorrow, or I'm going to have to set your house on fire or, Oh, you better
[11:16.860 --> 11:21.260]  look out different fucking story. Yeah. Don't do there's a bunch of investigative people that will
[11:21.260 --> 11:27.580]  look into your shit. But if you send an email that says, um, my state's not currently looking
[11:27.580 --> 11:33.260]  at legalization anyway. Um, I would love for you to be the elected representative in our area to
[11:33.260 --> 11:39.660]  lead on this issue. Um, or I'd like you to vote for something that somebody else is proposing.
[11:40.300 --> 11:46.460]  You can do all of that without any sort of fear of reprisal at this point. Um, and people from
[11:46.460 --> 11:50.300]  all over the country do it. Like I email people that aren't my elected representative at least
[11:50.300 --> 11:57.100]  twice a month. Um, 2019 is going to be huge for cannabis, uh, all sorts of States that don't have
[11:57.100 --> 12:02.620]  any sort of good cannabis laws right now. They're talking about doing it by, uh, by legislature
[12:02.620 --> 12:06.940]  because they're scared the public's going to do it without them. And they want to get ahead
[12:06.940 --> 12:11.020]  and get out in front of it. So there's like already a hundred or 200 cannabis bills
[12:11.660 --> 12:17.500]  up for debate in the coming year that we know about already. Nice. Um, so odds are that the
[12:17.500 --> 12:23.900]  person that asked this question and thousands like him are in a place where cannabis is already being
[12:23.900 --> 12:29.500]  debated. Um, and so joining that conversation through email or a phone call to your elected
[12:29.500 --> 12:34.780]  rep is very simple and you don't have to worry about blowback. Um, if you want to increase the
[12:34.780 --> 12:41.340]  risk a little bit, you can go to city council and stuff like that. Odds are very good that unless
[12:41.900 --> 12:48.380]  your company has business before the city council or your County commission or whatever governs the
[12:48.380 --> 12:56.060]  area you live in, um, that they don't follow that news. So unless you go and make a bunch of noise,
[12:56.620 --> 13:01.100]  the odds that anyone outside of that room, here's your message is pretty slim.
[13:01.660 --> 13:06.940]  Those are televised. Those are on public TV. I wouldn't do that. I had a couple of fun instances
[13:06.940 --> 13:15.820]  where old family friends of my dad's that live in the next city up the highway would watch our city
[13:15.820 --> 13:21.340]  council meetings for some reason and saw me and called him and we're like, your kids on TV.
[13:22.060 --> 13:27.740]  And some old people don't have anything to do. Yeah. And it's cable access. So it is one of the
[13:27.820 --> 13:34.940]  free channels, but, uh, the, the odds that your boss is watching that and that that's going to
[13:34.940 --> 13:41.580]  blow back on you are, are slimmer. Um, the other option there is there's even if you go talk
[13:41.580 --> 13:48.540]  publicly, there isn't in my experience, anyone confirming that you're really Jeff. And so you
[13:48.540 --> 13:53.580]  can go sign up as Jeff. You can go sign up as Paul, as long as you're not like Elvis Presley,
[13:54.220 --> 13:58.060]  like they're not going to check it. They're not even going to care. Um,
[13:58.060 --> 14:03.100]  the guy that had to type in the names that would pop up on the TV screen while you spoke,
[14:03.100 --> 14:08.380]  always used to give me shit because just out of nervousness, I would give another version of my
[14:08.380 --> 14:14.380]  name every time I went up. And so he never knew if I was going to say my first and my last,
[14:14.380 --> 14:18.860]  my first, my middle, my last, my middle, my last, if I was going to add the junior,
[14:18.860 --> 14:21.820]  I was going to, that's why people are like, how many fucking names does Mike have? It's
[14:21.820 --> 14:26.140]  because he's a junior. So, so sometimes I throw out the first name and the last, sometimes he
[14:26.140 --> 14:30.300]  skips it and goes with the middle and the last, I've heard him say both. It confused me the first
[14:30.300 --> 14:34.380]  time you said the first, the real name. I was like, wait, you're a who? It made me laugh because
[14:34.380 --> 14:40.060]  a couple of the people that were trying to fight, um, our local cannabis regs really thought I was
[14:40.060 --> 14:46.700]  three people. Like they thought there was, yeah, all of my different names that I'd happened to
[14:46.700 --> 14:50.060]  use on camera were different people. And they were like, they're brothers. They all look very
[14:50.060 --> 14:54.140]  similar. Like I think only one of them's got earrings and a different one wears glasses.
[14:55.260 --> 14:59.420]  All you bitches are just bad at. Dude. I only know two of the names, so I'm fucking lost on
[14:59.420 --> 15:05.500]  the third one. And it's fucking awesome. Yeah. It was like Mike, Michael. Oh, okay. There's a
[15:05.500 --> 15:09.020]  lot of variations. The guy who had to type in the names would always kind of give me a look like,
[15:09.580 --> 15:15.900]  like I had it when you walked up, I typed it in the one you use and now it's different. And I had
[15:16.380 --> 15:22.060]  on the fly. I'm just going to start calling you Mr. Pink. Yeah. But yeah, you don't have to,
[15:22.060 --> 15:26.700]  to even really give your legal name there. Um, another option that I've actually had people
[15:26.700 --> 15:34.860]  doing different campaigns is the official campaign will write a number of op-eds or
[15:34.860 --> 15:40.780]  letters to the editor. So like Charlotte's going to vote on marijuana and we think you should,
[15:40.780 --> 15:45.180]  for these reasons, I'm proud of myself. I wrote letters to the editor instead of releasing that
[15:45.180 --> 15:51.340]  letter to the editor is like from the weed corporation. They have it go out as like from
[15:51.340 --> 15:58.140]  some random person. Yeah. And it appears in the papers like from Bob Huxtable and that's just how
[15:58.140 --> 16:03.180]  it prints up in the paper. Uh, I see this all the time on all sorts of different topics. Like I'll,
[16:03.180 --> 16:11.820]  I'll know the person that submitted it or, um, no of them in the language in the article is
[16:11.820 --> 16:16.380]  something that they're not capable of. And so clearly you're submitting this on behalf of
[16:16.380 --> 16:22.060]  someone else. Yeah. But, uh, that's another thing to feel free to write a letter to the editor and
[16:22.060 --> 16:28.140]  you can submit it under whatever name you want. Um, make sure you're whatever submitting it on
[16:28.140 --> 16:32.220]  doesn't include your tagline at the bottom on all your emails. Cause that would be awkward.
[16:32.220 --> 16:41.100]  Sent from Ross to Jeff's iPhone. Right. Um, but I mean, there's a bunch of different ways you can
[16:41.180 --> 16:47.420]  stay anonymous. You can contribute financially to different campaigns. Dude, are you reading
[16:47.420 --> 16:52.220]  my fucking notes? Nope. This is just good ways to steal my thunder, bro. Good ways to help the
[16:52.220 --> 17:00.220]  cause anonymously. Um, you can have one-to-one conversations are huge. Um, like people would
[17:00.220 --> 17:06.700]  get really offended a couple of years back when the comparison between the, the cannabis legalization
[17:06.700 --> 17:12.140]  movement and the gay rights movements were being made. But the part of that argument that I always,
[17:12.140 --> 17:18.140]  that always really rang true to me was it's the one-to-one conversations with people that really
[17:18.140 --> 17:25.580]  end a lot of the nonsense stigma that society's thrown at the topic. And I know personally that
[17:25.580 --> 17:30.780]  sitting down with my anti-cannabis family members and being like, Hey, why do you care?
[17:31.580 --> 17:36.860]  Do you see me? Right. You heard like, it clearly hasn't ruined my brain. It hasn't fucked up my
[17:36.860 --> 17:42.380]  future. Um, it hasn't made me antisocial. None of the shit they taught you in school was true. It
[17:42.380 --> 17:49.820]  was all a lie. You can see the lie in motion right now. It just, the, the stigma just melts away.
[17:50.700 --> 17:54.460]  And so family members that were staunchly anti-cannabis now, now call me and they're
[17:54.460 --> 18:00.700]  like, Oh my God, it's coming up in my area. I'm excited. Um, it's, and that's for me.
[18:00.780 --> 18:05.340]  From those one-to-one conversations. If you're not really up for those,
[18:05.340 --> 18:11.020]  you can always just submit letters to the editor in their favorite newspaper and newspapers are
[18:11.020 --> 18:17.740]  dying for content and they hate having to pay people for it. And so when you send them letters
[18:17.740 --> 18:23.660]  for free that take up ad space, as long as you follow whatever one or two rules they have
[18:23.660 --> 18:28.300]  and your letters not insane, they'll print it. So if you're talking about, I think we should
[18:28.300 --> 18:32.220]  legalize weed a hundred percent, that letter is going to get printed. As long as you don't use
[18:32.220 --> 18:36.060]  curse words and you stick to their word limit. That's all you got to do. There you go. Maybe
[18:36.060 --> 18:39.420]  even ask them if they have a word limit, go read some of the articles that do get printed.
[18:39.420 --> 18:45.180]  It's super easy. Use that as a template. Okay. So go to any, um, go to any newspaper
[18:45.820 --> 18:52.140]  on their website, click on the opinion section. There'll be a letters to the editor tab,
[18:52.140 --> 18:56.700]  and there will be an easy tab that tells you, would you like to submit a letter to the editor?
[18:56.700 --> 18:59.660]  And if you click on it, it tells you everything you need to know. Some of them even bring up a
[18:59.660 --> 19:03.340]  little pop-up box for you to write it and pass into there. Oh, and then it'll show you the
[19:03.340 --> 19:08.780]  characters remaining. Yep. Or they'll give you an email, um, email address that you can submit it
[19:08.780 --> 19:14.300]  to. If you do that little box where it lets you submit it, copy it and paste it to a note file
[19:14.300 --> 19:20.700]  and save it. And if they don't publish it, send it back in a week. Stay on shit. I always recommend
[19:21.660 --> 19:27.180]  writing those in a different, um, different program. Oh yeah. Word or Google docs,
[19:27.180 --> 19:32.060]  whatever you're using. Cause they'd so that you can spell check and grammar check and all that
[19:32.060 --> 19:36.780]  thing disappears. Occasionally your web browser will refresh and your damn writing is gone.
[19:36.780 --> 19:40.620]  Yep. But almost all of them have an email address where you can email their opinion,
[19:40.620 --> 19:45.980]  letter editor, and they just, yep. This, this guy didn't say any bad words. He's not advocating
[19:45.980 --> 19:52.060]  genocide. He's under 250 words goes in the print file print, print, print every week. They go,
[19:52.060 --> 19:56.620]  how much Phil do we need? All right. That's one, two, three, four, five, six letters to
[19:56.620 --> 20:02.060]  the editor this week. You go show them the top six off the stack and print them. Um,
[20:02.060 --> 20:06.780]  it might take a couple of weeks, but they print a lot of those. I've had 20 letters to the editor
[20:06.780 --> 20:11.100]  printed over my life. Yeah. And I know when they're you, I know when I see them, it, uh,
[20:11.980 --> 20:19.020]  and now almost all of those were printed under my name, but, uh, it's, it's really not as difficult
[20:19.020 --> 20:23.980]  or scary as, as you think it is. And there's a lot of options. I see the one you've underlined
[20:23.980 --> 20:28.700]  repeatedly. Do you want to go ahead and do that one? Uh, well vote, vote. That's the most obvious
[20:28.700 --> 20:33.820]  way you can do your part to help legalize cannabis in your area and vote. Yeah. Vote. That's, uh,
[20:33.820 --> 20:39.180]  I've learned over the past few years, I think you and our other friend Wade encouraged me very
[20:39.180 --> 20:43.100]  strongly to become a voter and it feels good to fuck. You know, they made it super easy. Now,
[20:43.100 --> 20:46.780]  a little piece of paper comes to your house. You unfold it. You call your friend that knows a lot
[20:46.780 --> 20:49.820]  and you ask him to help you. And then he explains shit and you go Google it to make sure your
[20:49.820 --> 20:52.620]  friend's not full of shit. And you realize that Mike pretty much knows what he's talking about.
[20:52.620 --> 20:57.820]  You can just believe in him. I like it when people chat fact check me. Oh yeah. Well, I mean,
[20:57.820 --> 21:02.380]  cause some of the wording I'm like, wait, wait, wait. Well, it's designed like that. A lot of
[21:02.380 --> 21:06.140]  times it's designed to be tricky. Yeah. So I call you, I'm like, Hey, explain these three words in
[21:06.140 --> 21:10.620]  a row. Does that mean that I am or am I am not too? I don't know if I like this or hate it,
[21:10.620 --> 21:16.940]  but dude, voting's huge. And I've said it before and I've said it again. If even half of the people
[21:16.940 --> 21:23.580]  that consume cannabis every year took a minute to come out publicly and say, we're pro cannabis and
[21:23.580 --> 21:30.780]  we vote, we would be the most powerful voting block in the United States. We outnumber everybody,
[21:31.740 --> 21:35.900]  everybody. But people like our friend who sent us the message, they, maybe they can't,
[21:35.900 --> 21:41.020]  it's a huge, a huge majority of us all have something to risk. And voting booth is private.
[21:41.020 --> 21:45.020]  And that little ballot that comes in the mail is private. I dropped mine off in a little box and
[21:45.020 --> 21:49.020]  there were like 10 cars in front of me and 10 cars behind me, bro. They have no idea which one was
[21:49.020 --> 21:52.940]  mine unless they could tell that I was the heavy handed motherfucker scribbling in that. But there's
[21:53.260 --> 22:00.860]  they don't know who sent that in. I used to have a weird, like my life has always been kind of
[22:00.860 --> 22:07.340]  segmented in like weird chunks. And for a while, one of those chunks involved fancy dinners with
[22:07.340 --> 22:13.740]  governors, Supreme court justices in Colorado, Senate members, house representative members,
[22:13.740 --> 22:18.540]  the fucking governor. And I would be at a table with like the district attorney and our two state
[22:18.540 --> 22:22.460]  senators from our, from Pueblo. And there'd be eight of us at the table and we'd all be chit
[22:22.460 --> 22:29.260]  chatting. And these were great opportunities for me to just randomly mentioned pro cannabis things.
[22:29.820 --> 22:36.780]  And I was always delighted because especially with our two senators, they always had cannabis
[22:36.780 --> 22:41.420]  questions for me. They were, they knew I would be there. They knew I was going to be at their table
[22:41.420 --> 22:45.260]  and they had two that they wanted answers to. And they knew I was the person to come to. And that
[22:45.260 --> 22:54.060]  was after several of these dinners, but you might not have that kind of peace in your life, but you,
[22:54.060 --> 23:00.220]  everyone has a piece in their life where you can take good informed, supported cannabis knowledge
[23:00.860 --> 23:07.740]  and disseminated to people that need it, find those opportunities and take advantage of them.
[23:08.460 --> 23:15.740]  I know people in the medical field that have transformed how the department they work with
[23:15.740 --> 23:21.260]  or the doctor's office they work in views, cannabis views, cannabis consumers views,
[23:21.260 --> 23:28.940]  medical marijuana, all because they had a very uncomfortable conversation with their boss at one
[23:28.940 --> 23:37.660]  point and slowly started bringing in information and watch their workplace convert from anti-cannabis
[23:37.660 --> 23:41.500]  to pro cannabis. And this certainly is impossible for everybody. And then honestly,
[23:41.500 --> 23:46.620]  if you're making real money, I wouldn't fuck with my paycheck just to be pro weed,
[23:47.820 --> 23:50.620]  use a piece of that paycheck to fight for the cost for you.
[23:51.500 --> 23:55.580]  That leads to another thing. I don't know if you can see the little sloppily written dollar sign
[23:55.580 --> 24:00.220]  that I've got written down here, my methods of helping be an activist behind the scenes,
[24:00.220 --> 24:07.020]  but contribute financially to activism. If it is not, this person actually contributes to the
[24:07.020 --> 24:11.980]  podcast through Patreon. So do things like that. Also contribute to your local cannabis
[24:11.980 --> 24:16.940]  legalization efforts or also the national legalization. If it's local, if it's statewide,
[24:16.940 --> 24:20.300]  if it's national. I guarantee you've got a normal chapter in your state.
[24:20.300 --> 24:23.820]  I was going to say any, but he was specific, but go with normal. They're always reliable.
[24:23.820 --> 24:27.500]  Do the biggest, the best, the first, the original. Yep. Yep. Since the early seventies,
[24:27.500 --> 24:30.860]  you see Tommy Chong and Cheech wearing normal shirts in their movies back in the day.
[24:30.860 --> 24:34.380]  There's a reason. Yeah. So contribute some money to some activism,
[24:34.700 --> 24:38.540]  uh, vote with your dollars is what our friend Scotty real taught us. So get in there and send
[24:38.540 --> 24:42.300]  some money where, where you can. Uh, and this person does, they contribute to this podcast.
[24:42.300 --> 24:45.500]  I would assume they contribute to the dude grows. I bet you they contribute to several others
[24:45.500 --> 24:49.420]  because they're a great person, but, uh, that is always a great way to contribute. Send money to
[24:49.420 --> 24:57.420]  normal, send money to your local activism group. Um, so the next thing that that leads me to is
[24:57.420 --> 25:01.100]  if you're going to send money to somebody and it's your local group, why not get involved with
[25:01.100 --> 25:05.100]  your local group? Even if you can't attend the meetings and show your face, it's the digital
[25:05.100 --> 25:09.580]  era. You can get a digital newsletter to that fake email address you made so that you can send those
[25:09.580 --> 25:15.740]  emails to your local reps and to the newspaper. So get some newsletters, your local newsletters
[25:15.740 --> 25:19.100]  sent to you and provide feedback, provide information. If you're getting knowledge
[25:19.100 --> 25:23.740]  from Mike and myself or other sources, include that in your feedback to that newsletter or
[25:24.460 --> 25:29.100]  create the newsletter. Now that may be your role. And you can do that anonymously. You can do that
[25:29.180 --> 25:33.580]  from your computer and your underwear while you're listening to the show. You can jot down ideas,
[25:33.580 --> 25:37.260]  you can get it going, and that can be your service to the community behind the scenes with nobody
[25:37.260 --> 25:42.460]  ever seeing your face. Well, honestly, Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws exists for two reasons.
[25:43.100 --> 25:49.260]  One, we had an idiot pot group down here. They sort of still exist. Um, that was putting out a
[25:49.260 --> 25:54.860]  lot of bad information and that information needed to be countered. And the other part of that,
[25:54.860 --> 26:00.940]  and this is like 75% of it is one of my nieces was like, was ragging on my Facebook page.
[26:01.740 --> 26:07.820]  Um, because it's, everything was cannabis related at least. It wasn't explicitly pro-cannabis. It
[26:07.820 --> 26:13.580]  was a cannabis related news story or something. And she just like, it was just one dinner where
[26:13.580 --> 26:20.300]  she had like three good burns, um, that were all focused on my, my personal Facebook page being
[26:20.300 --> 26:26.620]  overly cannabis related. Uh, so I wanted another outlet for that. And there's literally nothing
[26:26.620 --> 26:33.180]  stopping you from starting a Facebook group in your area or a Facebook page or a Twitter page
[26:33.180 --> 26:39.420]  under a separate account. That's not overtly related to you where you can do all sorts of
[26:39.420 --> 26:46.140]  digital activism. Um, that's not overtly under your name or is going to come up in a simple
[26:46.140 --> 26:53.180]  background search. Can always start a podcast. You can, you most certainly can. I encourage it
[26:53.900 --> 26:58.940]  to be honest. I, you get used to the microphone and you, you admit things that you might not want
[26:58.940 --> 27:04.380]  to admit to the world sometimes. And so having someone like you, that's really good with garage
[27:04.380 --> 27:10.940]  band, they can take out some of the insanity is kind of necessary there. Um, if you're looking
[27:11.020 --> 27:17.180]  to get involved, I'm thinking you're not currently involved. And so honestly, like research and
[27:17.180 --> 27:22.940]  emailing and letter writing, I think is a great place to start. And honestly, campaign donations
[27:22.940 --> 27:28.540]  and voting, they're super easy. They're not time consuming and they're incredibly effective.
[27:28.540 --> 27:33.100]  Well, I'm proud of myself for writing down campaign donations and voting. I'm pretty confident now.
[27:34.540 --> 27:39.740]  I loved the donate $4 and 20 cents to two different candidates campaign that was run
[27:40.300 --> 27:47.500]  during the last election cycle. Because one thing that all politicians see is their donations
[27:48.620 --> 27:53.420]  and they might not see every donation explicitly and like who it's from,
[27:53.420 --> 27:57.660]  but they're going to thumb through the pages and see how they did that week at some point.
[27:57.660 --> 28:02.700]  And if they're flipping through the binder, just standing through the pages and they've received
[28:02.700 --> 28:07.900]  a hundred donations or 30 donations or whatever it is for the same amount, it's going to stand out.
[28:07.900 --> 28:13.820]  Yeah. I say, why am I getting four 20? The number explicitly tells you why you got that donation.
[28:13.820 --> 28:21.580]  Yep. It's super simple. It was an incredibly effective messaging. And I got to watch in real
[28:21.580 --> 28:29.980]  time politicians change their tone on the topic as these, this donation platform rolled out,
[28:29.980 --> 28:37.020]  people went from, um, not discussing it to having a campaign challenger or a primary challenger,
[28:37.020 --> 28:42.780]  bring it up once or twice to having it be centerpiece of their campaign to they've already
[28:42.780 --> 28:47.020]  pledged to get it done within the first year or whatever their time in office.
[28:47.020 --> 28:49.340]  Cause they see all those four 20 donations coming in.
[28:49.340 --> 28:54.620]  They saw the support and they saw how far the tides turned on this issue from just a few years
[28:54.620 --> 28:59.660]  ago. Yeah. It's come quickly. Yeah. It can happen to really quickly. Um, there were a lot of
[28:59.660 --> 29:04.380]  unanswered questions five years ago. I mean, we didn't know if like the UN was going to lose their
[29:04.380 --> 29:09.420]  shit because we've signed international treaties that say we won't legalize this. Um, there's more
[29:09.420 --> 29:17.740]  than one, there's all sorts of state and federal rules. I mean, there's nothing stopping the DEA
[29:17.740 --> 29:22.060]  from showing up and trying to shut us down. Right. There's, there's absolutely nothing
[29:22.060 --> 29:25.820]  stopping them. Nothing at all. Every grow, every dispensary.
[29:26.380 --> 29:29.980]  What's stopping them is logistics in the reality of it in public opinion.
[29:30.620 --> 29:35.900]  And if public opinion were really against us, they'd be trying to knock us down three a day.
[29:36.620 --> 29:42.300]  Um, and they'd be trying real hard and it'd be all over the news. And they know that if they
[29:42.300 --> 29:47.500]  hit three on Monday, on Tuesday, they're going to have 200, 300 people outside of everyone.
[29:47.500 --> 29:52.780]  They try to hit on Tuesday and by Wednesday, we're going to be stopping highways and shit.
[29:52.780 --> 29:56.300]  Where you just gave me like, I was, as you were building up to that, I was building the most
[29:56.300 --> 29:59.900]  insane visual in my head of like, well, fuck, they took down three dispensaries yesterday.
[29:59.900 --> 30:04.220]  There were this many cops. Let's all go surround our favorite dispensaries and fight back. And it
[30:04.220 --> 30:08.860]  became this battle in my head. That's fucking so funny in my mind. History loves to repeat itself.
[30:08.860 --> 30:13.020]  And we did this in California already a couple of times. I mean, there's great footage in a couple
[30:13.020 --> 30:18.620]  of the good cannabis documentaries. Um, like waiting to inhale and stuff where the feds show
[30:18.620 --> 30:25.180]  up to raid a very popular farm with a huge number of patients that was growing in the best way they
[30:25.180 --> 30:31.580]  could and giving away as much as they could. And the feds are rating these people and the feds have
[30:31.580 --> 30:37.660]  to do negotiations that involve letting the people they arrested that morning, call the crowd that
[30:37.660 --> 30:44.300]  is formed while they were cutting all the plants down to beg the crowd to disperse, um, to please
[30:44.300 --> 30:50.140]  not do anything, to please let these officers pass peaceably. And they roll up their windows,
[30:50.140 --> 30:55.900]  they tucked down, they fucking ran and they did not come back. Yeah. Um, what would happen if we
[30:55.900 --> 30:59.500]  threatened, oh, we're just going to burn down all the bars and breweries, no more alcohol for
[30:59.500 --> 31:05.500]  everybody. We wouldn't even have to do, we wouldn't even have to damage stuff. The there's this, one
[31:05.500 --> 31:12.140]  of the things that nobody understands about politics and numbers is once you reach a certain
[31:12.140 --> 31:17.820]  size of the crowd, you can achieve anything. And if you look at history, wonderful things have
[31:17.820 --> 31:22.540]  been achieved, horrible atrocities, atrocities have been achieved and they've both been achieved
[31:22.540 --> 31:27.820]  the same way. You get a whole crowd hyped up about one thing or the other, he's wrong with it. And
[31:28.780 --> 31:34.860]  I honestly think that if the DEA showed up and just for an example, they started one end of the
[31:34.860 --> 31:39.820]  state, they try to work their way to the other. They can only bust. There's only so many DEA
[31:39.820 --> 31:45.100]  agents, even if they had every DEA agent on the planet show up in Southern Colorado, they couldn't
[31:45.100 --> 31:53.340]  do credit at a day. Um, and so literally by the end of day one, there's enough news footage.
[31:53.340 --> 31:59.100]  There's enough press footage of this happening. And this being the plan to disseminate across the
[31:59.100 --> 32:05.660]  globe news goes out instantly now. And there's enough of us just in Colorado that if we all hop
[32:05.660 --> 32:09.820]  in our cars and took the three hour drive, we could end it all in a minute just by showing up
[32:09.820 --> 32:14.700]  and being like, Hey, now go away. We don't want you here. That's all we'd have to do. We wouldn't
[32:14.700 --> 32:19.020]  have to shout. We wouldn't have to yell. We just have to show up at once and say it in unison.
[32:19.900 --> 32:28.300]  And we used to do it once a year on 420 down at civic center before medical, before legalization
[32:28.300 --> 32:37.180]  in 98, 2004, a hundred thousand people would just walk into civic center park. And the cops,
[32:37.180 --> 32:43.340]  if this was any other day would ruin a month or more of your life. If you lit up cannabis
[32:44.300 --> 32:49.260]  and a hundred thousand of us just did it together. And there was not a thing they could do about it
[32:49.820 --> 32:53.340]  because they knew that if they started grabbing one of us, they'd have to deal with a hundred
[32:53.340 --> 32:57.820]  thousand of us. And we weren't hurting nobody. We weren't arguing with nobody,
[32:58.540 --> 33:05.660]  nothing. We just peacefully came together, had a good laugh, peacefully left. And there was nothing
[33:05.660 --> 33:12.380]  they could do about it. And just that happening so many years in a row, push the conversation in
[33:12.380 --> 33:17.900]  Colorado so much faster. And we saw the same thing. Seattle had a big smoke out. California
[33:17.900 --> 33:24.060]  had a number of big smoke outs. There's something that, I mean, the five or the six years down the
[33:24.060 --> 33:29.100]  road after the first smoke out when the news anchor is still making the same jokes, but you're
[33:29.100 --> 33:35.900]  like, wait a second on St. Patty's day, St. Patty's was Monday by Wednesday, the DUI reports are out
[33:36.860 --> 33:42.940]  fucking four 20 was months ago. I never read a report saying a bunch of traffic accidents. It's
[33:42.940 --> 33:52.140]  not a thing. That stuff starts to sink in little side effects of just the visual start to sink in.
[33:52.140 --> 33:56.940]  There was one year where the worst thing that could have happened, happened, happened in Denver
[33:56.940 --> 34:02.780]  and somebody brought a gun and fired off three rounds, minor injuries. I think,
[34:03.500 --> 34:09.820]  I don't think anybody was severely injured. A couple of people got hurt when people were
[34:09.820 --> 34:18.220]  running away. But I remember the next day when everyone was like, wait, a hundred thousand
[34:18.220 --> 34:24.220]  people got really high and then ran away really fast, got in their cars and sped out of here
[34:25.180 --> 34:32.140]  in no fender benders, no flipped over cars, no run over pedestrians, nothing.
[34:32.940 --> 34:39.020]  It's just a hundred thousand people just evacuated the area immediately without any sort of major
[34:39.020 --> 34:45.980]  traffic issue. And watching the news media try to wrestle with that blatantly obvious fact that
[34:45.980 --> 34:51.020]  they were trying not to specifically address was funny. I mean, it was a tragic incident and I
[34:51.100 --> 34:57.100]  hated to see it happen, but at the same time, it was one of those real world tests that teaches us
[34:57.100 --> 35:02.540]  a lot of stuff we didn't know we needed to learn. I mean, in Colorado, we learned a lot of those
[35:02.540 --> 35:06.700]  lessons over the last five years and the rest of the world stood up and took notice. When these
[35:06.700 --> 35:11.900]  conversations go down this year in Virginia and New Jersey, the debate about whether the UN's
[35:11.900 --> 35:17.020]  going to send peacekeepers to shut down the weed store. I had to have that fucking debate more than
[35:17.020 --> 35:25.260]  once. And convincing people that the UN wasn't going to impose major sanctions against Colorado.
[35:25.980 --> 35:33.820]  It was nuts. All those conversations are gone. You can look at year after year after year of teen
[35:33.820 --> 35:39.340]  use data now. It's all online. You just need to know how to ask Google. You just ask NICE and
[35:39.340 --> 35:45.340]  it'll tell you teen use has not gone up. The one thing that has changed in a big way is the
[35:45.340 --> 35:51.740]  perception of harm. And it's all of the bullshit we were spoon feeding them in the 90s is no longer
[35:51.740 --> 35:57.420]  being spoon fed. Actual information is being spoon fed. Their opinions on cannabis are more
[35:57.420 --> 36:03.660]  in line with reality. And that's statistically visual or seeable in the graphs. You can see that
[36:04.220 --> 36:09.340]  their attitudes towards how dangerous it is has drastically changed over the last five or 10 years,
[36:09.340 --> 36:14.860]  but their use rates haven't. And people are starting to see videos like the Brave
[36:14.860 --> 36:18.620]  Michaela videos and the video of the, I don't know the person's name and I would rather know
[36:18.620 --> 36:22.620]  his name because I feel disrespectful, but there's a man on Facebook. I see the video all the time in
[36:22.620 --> 36:26.540]  marijuana groups, cannabis groups, excuse me. They'll start having a seizure and they scored
[36:26.540 --> 36:30.220]  a little CBD oil on his mouth. And within seconds, the dude stops having a major seizure.
[36:30.860 --> 36:34.940]  People are seeing videos like that. I think that's making, if you show videos like that to my mom,
[36:34.940 --> 36:38.620]  she cries. Back in the day, she didn't believe it when I called cannabis medicine. She's like,
[36:38.620 --> 36:42.140]  you guys are just using that as an excuse to smoke weed. And now when she sees things like
[36:42.140 --> 36:45.100]  that, she gets a little tear in her eye and she's like, oh, you guys are right.
[36:45.100 --> 36:48.620]  Ben Dominos, Joe Fieta, Jr.: I remember saying one night, it wasn't Thanksgiving dinner,
[36:48.620 --> 36:52.060]  but it was a similar family event with like 15 or 20 people there.
[36:52.060 --> 36:57.020]  Most of whom were older adults that I respected in my life. And I remember telling one of them
[36:57.740 --> 37:03.660]  that cannabis was the most beneficial plant known to man. And this was a statement largely based on
[37:03.660 --> 37:08.140]  the different products we can make with hemp and a couple of the minor medical uses we've
[37:08.140 --> 37:13.420]  known about for a long time with THC, like lowering inner eye pressure, helping with nausea,
[37:13.420 --> 37:19.020]  especially for chemotherapy patients and the like, who really have trouble swallowing other
[37:19.020 --> 37:25.020]  medications, that kind of thing. And we've known that hard science since the late seventies.
[37:26.060 --> 37:28.860]  And I remember most of the people at the table laughing at me.
[37:29.580 --> 37:33.420]  Now, when you say things like that, it's just part of the press about the farm bill.
[37:33.980 --> 37:35.740]  People start telling you about their CBD company.
[37:35.740 --> 37:38.860]  Ben Dominos, Joe Fieta, Jr.: Yeah, their CBD. But if you really think about it,
[37:39.820 --> 37:48.060]  I mean, cotton, oil, and trees. Think about all the stuff and all of the damage we're doing to
[37:48.060 --> 37:54.460]  the environment, the planet, ourselves, each other over some of these things. And imagine if we could
[37:55.180 --> 37:59.420]  change all of that with fields that are currently growing nothing.
[37:59.420 --> 38:05.020]  Yeah. Fill them up with hemp. Yeah. I mean, we can stop clear cutting forests.
[38:05.020 --> 38:08.380]  Oh, Mike, we got to start wrapping up this podcast. I apologize. Yeah, we went, it's almost
[38:08.380 --> 38:09.820]  two o'clock, so we got to start wrapping this up.
[38:09.820 --> 38:11.340]  It's negative snap, but it's super late.
[38:11.340 --> 38:13.340]  That won't be a problem. I'll just edit that part out.
[38:13.340 --> 38:17.500]  But yeah, just imagine what we're going to see over the next five or six years when this really
[38:17.500 --> 38:19.500]  happens. We're going to see this market take off for sure.
[38:19.500 --> 38:23.900]  Absolutely. I want to recap on what this person asked. They asked for, what got us into this is
[38:23.900 --> 38:28.220]  they asked for ways that they could help the farmers. And I think that's a really good question.
[38:28.220 --> 38:32.140]  This is they asked for ways that they can be active without exposing themselves. We got way
[38:32.140 --> 38:37.500]  off the track. I got to start wrapping up this show. So send emails, create an anonymous email
[38:37.500 --> 38:43.180]  account, send emails. Doesn't even need to be anonymous if you don't want it to. If you want
[38:43.180 --> 38:47.740]  your statement to have impact, at least attach a fake name. Right. Yeah. Yeah. A fake name,
[38:47.740 --> 38:52.620]  a suit, a pen name. That's what I'm looking for. So put a pen name on there, write some emails,
[38:52.620 --> 38:59.660]  send those to your local, the politicians, the what's the guy, the mayor who makes, who helps us
[38:59.660 --> 39:04.220]  make those rules. So it depends on who you want to reach. If you're looking local level, it's
[39:04.220 --> 39:11.980]  probably a mayor or a president of city council or the current president of your county commission.
[39:12.940 --> 39:17.260]  This is all stuff you'll be able to find. Just Google the name of the place you're talking about
[39:17.260 --> 39:21.100]  and then add the word government to the end of it. And it will bring up the cast of characters.
[39:21.900 --> 39:27.580]  Um, if it's the state, you're looking at the governor, um, nation, president, senator.
[39:27.580 --> 39:31.340]  Email all of them and do it like once a week and tell them that you support the legalization of
[39:31.340 --> 39:35.820]  cannabis. Most of them make them crazy easy. The bigger the politician, the easier they make it.
[39:35.820 --> 39:42.300]  If you want to email Trump, Google the words, email and Trump together. And it will basically
[39:42.300 --> 39:46.540]  bring you up a link where you can email a dummy box that some intern at the president's office
[39:46.540 --> 39:50.700]  answers. You may have more luck if you just hit them up on Twitter. Yeah. You may reply.
[39:51.340 --> 39:57.580]  But senators like your state senator, it's just as easy. Google email, Elizabeth Warren, email,
[39:57.580 --> 40:04.700]  email the rigor, see a email, Bob Bennett. Um, and boom, it brings up their direct email address
[40:04.700 --> 40:10.140]  that goes to a staffer in their office usually. Um, and then they're assigned to send you the
[40:10.140 --> 40:14.780]  blanket reply for that topic. Thank you for your interest in this topic. We will be back with a
[40:14.780 --> 40:20.620]  reply. But one of the important things that those people do is they rank them. And so at a certain
[40:20.620 --> 40:26.540]  point, this politician gets a little report that says, Hey, you had 47 people this week reach out
[40:26.540 --> 40:35.020]  about gun control, healthcare, cannabis. Um, 10 were pro 40 were against, and they get those
[40:35.020 --> 40:39.020]  numbers and they get a gauge of what their constituents are willing to reach out about
[40:39.020 --> 40:45.900]  them about. Um, if you live in the area that votes for this person mentioned that explicitly,
[40:45.900 --> 40:51.260]  you don't have to be like, I live at one, two, three, four, but Hey, I live in your district
[40:51.980 --> 40:57.980]  and I vote. Here's my issue that I care about. That's a more effective message than just, Hey,
[40:57.980 --> 41:02.140]  vote for this. Cause I send those to people who I don't vote for all the time. And a lot of other
[41:02.140 --> 41:08.780]  people do too. Um, the anti-cannabis groups are getting better at the emailing thing. Um, I watch
[41:08.780 --> 41:13.900]  them try to teach people how to do this and it's funny, but, uh, our community is much better with
[41:13.900 --> 41:17.020]  technology. I don't think we're going to have those issues, but this super easy to do to reach
[41:17.020 --> 41:21.420]  out to your representatives. All right. Then once you've reached out to all of them, use that same
[41:21.420 --> 41:26.780]  email address to send some letters to the editor of your local newspapers, not just the local,
[41:26.780 --> 41:32.780]  go to the other cities surrounding you. Also, before you submit, read it aloud. Yeah. Make
[41:32.780 --> 41:39.100]  sure it makes sense. Make sure you, yeah. Um, please, please, please, please edit. Also you
[41:39.100 --> 41:44.300]  can create a Facebook group or you can go join other forums, or you can create a podcast. If
[41:44.300 --> 41:48.620]  you're that kind of person that people may learn your voice, eventually you may need to be low-key
[41:48.620 --> 41:53.740]  about that. You can also contribute financially to activism causes. You can send $4 and 20 cents.
[41:53.740 --> 41:57.900]  You can send $7 and 10 cents to your favorite podcast on Patreon every month. I'm not saying
[41:57.900 --> 42:02.380]  just me, I'm saying myself, the dude grows, uh, good podcast, shango Lowe's out there. It could
[42:02.380 --> 42:06.860]  use some support. Uh, who else do we support? Tad Hussie at kiss organics. You can help out so many
[42:06.860 --> 42:11.580]  people financially. Uh, there's also normal, you've got local cannabis or local cannabis
[42:11.580 --> 42:16.220]  activism that you can support financially. Um, there's a lot of other national groups than
[42:16.220 --> 42:21.020]  normal. Like I don't want to stress one above the other, but like there's students for a sensible
[42:21.020 --> 42:25.900]  drug policy. There's the national, um, there's normal, there's the marijuana policy project.
[42:26.620 --> 42:31.180]  Um, I mean, those are just the ones that I'm randomly thinking of at the end. There's a
[42:31.180 --> 42:35.340]  bunch and there's going to be state specific groups, no matter what state you live in.
[42:36.060 --> 42:41.500]  Guaranteed. So join those, maybe create a newsletter or just be a part of the newsletter
[42:41.500 --> 42:46.140]  and add, contribute to it. Reply, say, Hey, I think this gets some conversations going with
[42:46.140 --> 42:49.340]  people, open their minds, share the truth. If you're listening, you're learning a lot of good
[42:49.340 --> 42:53.580]  stuff that you can share. So go share a lot of that stuff. And the final one that I've got on
[42:53.580 --> 42:57.020]  the list of Mike, the most obvious that Mike likes to talk about that I'm proud of myself for having
[42:57.020 --> 43:02.700]  written down without some sort of guidance is vote, vote. When it comes time to vote on cannabis,
[43:02.700 --> 43:05.980]  just show up and vote. Like I said earlier, they send the little paper to your house.
[43:05.980 --> 43:09.740]  It's really hard to miss it. They make it a lot harder in other places. It's a really,
[43:09.740 --> 43:13.260]  no, do they? Cause here it's like a different color than all the other mail. And it's got the
[43:13.260 --> 43:19.180]  big flag on it. And it says ballot. Yeah. They've made it remarkably easy in Colorado, but there are
[43:19.180 --> 43:23.660]  still many places around the country that make it pretty hard. Like you, some places you have to go
[43:23.660 --> 43:28.460]  to a fiscal location, other places you have to register months in advance. Um, so it can be a
[43:28.460 --> 43:32.140]  little tricky, but once you do it once, you know how it goes and it's super easy to do again.
[43:32.780 --> 43:37.260]  It's also insanely important. Here's a trick. This is kind of a magic trick.
[43:37.820 --> 43:42.060]  If you were a cannabis consumer and you are listening, you're going to vote,
[43:42.060 --> 43:46.940]  encourage your pothead friends to vote also. And then you're tricking. You're not realistically
[43:46.940 --> 43:50.620]  going and advocating cannabis, but you're actually getting a vote for our side. And you're just
[43:50.620 --> 43:56.540]  telling your pothead friends to vote. A piece for the people to still listen. Cause obviously you
[43:56.540 --> 44:01.500]  care about this topic. You were to turn this off by now. Those personal conversations I was talking
[44:01.500 --> 44:09.340]  about aren't just with anti-cannabis people, also pro cannabis people. Um, there's a lot of
[44:09.340 --> 44:16.460]  misinformation and bad information in the cannabis world. And when we disseminate that publicly,
[44:16.460 --> 44:22.860]  it hurts our cause. And so having the courage to sit down with your pro cannabis friends and be
[44:22.860 --> 44:27.580]  like, bro, when you're out there talking about pro cannabis stuff, could you pretty please not
[44:27.660 --> 44:34.060]  talk about chemtrail stuff too? That kind of stuff. Could you maybe not open your speech
[44:34.620 --> 44:40.540]  with your beliefs about its cancer curative properties and maybe talk about some of the
[44:40.540 --> 44:46.700]  other benefits of legalization that you also believe in that we can support with hard data?
[44:48.380 --> 44:53.340]  Because it's making those arguments in a way that can be quickly fact-checked. That's the most
[44:53.340 --> 44:59.420]  effective and reducing our bad information that our community is putting out is just as helpful
[45:00.060 --> 45:06.060]  is converting other people to our cause. Don't bro science people. I think that's what Mike is
[45:06.060 --> 45:08.860]  saying. All right, Mike, we've been going for a long time. This is one of the longest podcasts
[45:08.860 --> 45:13.340]  we've done in a while. There will be a very little touch of editing in this. Um, thank you,
[45:13.340 --> 45:16.780]  hash dude. You've got a lot of stuff to say today. I wish I could just let you keep recording
[45:16.780 --> 45:21.100]  cause you're fired up. I keep going to, but we need to stop. It's really late folks. Yeah,
[45:21.100 --> 45:23.820]  it's late. So we're going to wrap up this podcast. I want to thank you guys for listening. Hey,
[45:23.820 --> 45:25.900]  Mike, thanks for coming and hanging out. Spend a lot of time with me.
[45:25.900 --> 45:28.780]  Thanks so much for having me, man. If this ends up being two shows, I'm okay with it.
[45:28.780 --> 45:31.820]  I was kind of thinking that. So it may be two shows. You never know. We're going to have to
[45:31.820 --> 45:36.220]  edit some of this stuff out, but it should be out right now. So who knows? All right, podcast world,
[45:36.220 --> 45:39.260]  we're going to wrap up this podcast. I want to thank Mikey once again for hanging out. I want
[45:39.260 --> 45:43.660]  to thank you guys for listening to this episode of the grow from your heart podcast. Make sure
[45:43.660 --> 45:49.340]  you follow Mikey's Nemo punk 15 on the Twitter. Um, you can find Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws
[45:49.340 --> 45:53.420]  on the Facebook. If you give it a quick search, uh, Mike says they are harder to find the cannabis
[45:53.420 --> 45:57.340]  pages that maybe that's why I read genetics. Isn't getting any new follows on the, on the Facebook.
[45:57.980 --> 46:01.820]  Uh, Mike, thanks for coming, bro. Thanks for having me, man. Uh, you guys, if you feel like
