[00:16.380 --> 00:20.940]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 268 of the
[00:20.940 --> 00:24.940]  Grow From Your Heart podcast. Your source for cannabis news, education, and
[00:24.940 --> 00:28.260]  conversation. That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional
[00:28.260 --> 00:31.700]  grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:31.700 --> 00:34.620]  activist or even someone who is just curious about the current state of
[00:34.620 --> 00:39.700]  cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends, call me
[00:39.700 --> 00:43.420]  Ross DeJeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As always, I need to
[00:43.420 --> 00:46.420]  send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roof Band for
[00:46.420 --> 00:50.980]  letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
[00:50.980 --> 00:57.380]  Mystic Roof crew. Once again, welcome to the show, everybody. I am dabbing on some
[00:57.380 --> 01:02.340]  Tahoe OG batter from Apothecary and it made me totally numb for a couple of
[01:02.340 --> 01:05.540]  seconds. That's something I haven't experienced in quite a while. Took a big
[01:05.540 --> 01:08.660]  old fat dab and my whole body went numb. I felt like that dude in that movie, I can't
[01:08.660 --> 01:12.420]  feel my legs. And then I was like, wait, I can't feel my legs. It's kind of a cool
[01:12.420 --> 01:16.340]  thing. I was like, I'm fucking numb. Feel all rubbery and Gumby-like. That was kind
[01:16.340 --> 01:19.220]  of nice. Shout out to our friends at Apothecary for great work with the, uh,
[01:19.220 --> 01:24.260]  the Tahoe batter. I don't know who grew the material, but, uh, the hash did a hell
[01:24.260 --> 01:28.460]  of a great job. All right, I'm gonna get my Gumby ass together here and we're
[01:28.460 --> 01:32.500]  gonna talk about some podcast stuff. You guys, I had a great week. I hate to come
[01:32.500 --> 01:36.900]  on the podcast and brag, but holy crap. A big shout out to White Mike and also to
[01:36.900 --> 01:43.020]  White Mike's wife. Uh, White Mike invited me to go see Kevin Smith, uh, and Jason
[01:43.020 --> 01:46.540]  Muse, Jay and Silent Bob get old of recording of a live podcast here in
[01:46.540 --> 01:50.260]  Pueblo. That's right. Kevin Smith and Jason Muse came to Pueblo, Colorado. They
[01:50.260 --> 01:53.900]  did a live recording of their podcast at a place called Memorial Hall, which is
[01:53.900 --> 01:57.620]  right downtown in Pueblo. Uh, first of all, I'm fucking surprised that I've never
[01:57.620 --> 02:02.140]  been to a show at Memorial Hall because of the places. Super cool. It's real tiny.
[02:02.460 --> 02:06.660]  It's, uh, we were right up front, so it seemed real tiny to me. It's kind of a,
[02:06.860 --> 02:11.020]  it's a smaller sized venue. One thing I did notice that tickets for every show
[02:11.020 --> 02:14.660]  were quite overpriced. You can see the same show for cheaper somewhere else, but
[02:14.660 --> 02:17.540]  it's a really tiny place. It's kind of a cool place. I'm amazed I've never been
[02:17.540 --> 02:21.340]  there for a show, but Kevin Smith and Jason Muse, of course, Jane Silent Bob
[02:21.340 --> 02:25.260]  from all the Jane Silent Bob movies. Kevin Smith is director of quite a few
[02:25.260 --> 02:30.620]  movies. He directed Mallrats, Clerks, Chasing Amy. What's the other one? Tusk.
[02:30.620 --> 02:34.420]  They make fun of him a lot for Tusk. Jane Silent Bob strike back. But anyway,
[02:35.100 --> 02:38.700]  we got to go check that out. Mike got front row tickets for that. Mike went,
[02:38.700 --> 02:43.460]  his wife joined and our buddy Brian from work tagged along with the, uh, the other
[02:43.460 --> 02:46.540]  ticket that we had. So that was a good time. Uh, Hey Mike, thanks for taking me,
[02:46.540 --> 02:50.220]  bro. I laughed my ass off. I ate a lot of edibles before I went and I took a
[02:50.220 --> 02:53.580]  gigantic dab right before the show. So everyone's like a couple of my friends
[02:53.580 --> 02:56.620]  like you. Okay, bro. I was like, I'm just high as fuck. I don't have anything to
[02:56.620 --> 02:59.740]  fucking say. And people were trying to talk to me and I just couldn't think of
[02:59.820 --> 03:04.220]  any, there was no words. There were not words for my head at the time. It just
[03:04.220 --> 03:08.300]  wasn't shit for me to say. So I just stayed silent most of the time. So that was my
[03:08.300 --> 03:11.260]  Friday night, uh, Friday night. I zipped home from work, kind of cleaned up a
[03:11.260 --> 03:15.100]  little bit and then went and saw Kevin Smith. And then Saturday, what did I do?
[03:15.100 --> 03:19.340]  Saturday hung out a little bit. Uh, I did some gardening, did some stuff like that.
[03:19.340 --> 03:23.900]  And then, uh, went up to Colorado Springs and saw Harry Mo and the Colorado
[03:23.900 --> 03:27.820]  reggae unit featuring miss Jenny Beth on vocals and, uh, quite a few other
[03:27.820 --> 03:31.580]  amazing reggae artists. I watched them play one set danced around. There weren't
[03:31.580 --> 03:35.660]  many people dancing. And so I thought, watch this. I let my dreadlocks down and
[03:35.660 --> 03:37.980]  I went stand in the middle of the dance floor, went and stood in the middle. What
[03:37.980 --> 03:41.740]  did I just say? Went and stood. I think I said I went and standed. God damn. I'm
[03:41.740 --> 03:44.300]  high. I went and stood in the middle of the dance floor. I don't know how to
[03:44.300 --> 03:48.940]  dance. You guys, I'm six foot five and I'm lanky and I'm goofy, but I just let
[03:48.940 --> 03:52.460]  my dreadlocks down and just wiggle around like a fucking white hippie and just
[03:52.460 --> 03:56.140]  shake my dreadlocks around to the reggae music. And the reggae band was smiling at
[03:56.140 --> 03:58.940]  me like, I know what you're doing. And then suddenly all the people were dancing.
[03:58.940 --> 04:01.740]  It was a good ass time. You just got to break the ice. You just got to dance.
[04:01.740 --> 04:05.740]  But then, uh, for the second set, um, we ate some food during the set break.
[04:05.740 --> 04:08.380]  There's a little break there for the musicians to take a rest, played for about
[04:08.380 --> 04:11.980]  an hour. And then they took a break and then I was eating some food, finishing up
[04:11.980 --> 04:15.900]  some of JV's free meal. She gets for being in the band and, uh, they yelled
[04:15.900 --> 04:18.780]  Rasta Jeff. We need you to come up here and play Jembe. So they invited me up on
[04:18.780 --> 04:22.620]  stage again to go play Jembe with them. It's always fun to join the reggae band,
[04:22.700 --> 04:26.540]  bunch of really good reggae musicians. Uh, they're all, I think all of them are
[04:26.540 --> 04:30.140]  probably older than myself. And I really like playing with older musicians. There's
[04:30.140 --> 04:34.860]  less ego. There's a better tempo. It's more musical, uh, nothing against young
[04:34.860 --> 04:37.820]  musicians, but the older cats have something, especially in reggae music.
[04:37.820 --> 04:40.940]  You just need a rhythm section that just lays back and plays rhythm. You don't
[04:40.940 --> 04:44.780]  need a whole bunch of fancy shit. And these guys are older cats and they nail it. So
[04:44.780 --> 04:49.740]  shout out to Jenny, Beth, Harry Mo and the entire Colorado reggae unit.
[04:50.620 --> 04:54.940]  All right, let's turn down this music. You guys, I am still dad the fuck out from, I
[04:54.940 --> 04:58.300]  took two dads of that Tahoe. The first one I was like, that wasn't enough. So I went
[04:58.300 --> 05:02.060]  in a little harder on the second one and my whole body went numb. I got goosebumps
[05:02.060 --> 05:05.580]  and my arm hair moved around. It was fucking awesome. I could feel my eyes all
[05:05.580 --> 05:10.220]  droopy. I hope I'm not doing a terrible podcast. All right, guys, let's talk about
[05:10.220 --> 05:14.460]  my most, uh, my newest breeding project, my newest and most recent breeding
[05:14.460 --> 05:17.580]  project. I'm always talking about breeding stuff, right? So my current
[05:17.580 --> 05:21.100]  breeding project, I have got, of course, it's a King Solomon male. King Solomon is
[05:21.100 --> 05:25.340]  golden goat cross to the daybreaker. Uh, I'm using King Solomon. I found an amazing
[05:25.340 --> 05:29.180]  male. I've talked about it a lot. I probably went through somewhere between 250
[05:29.180 --> 05:34.140]  and 500 seeds of the arise cross to find the male that I wanted. I've got the stud
[05:34.140 --> 05:38.540]  that I want. I named him King Solomon. He's in a room right now. Uh, he is getting
[05:38.540 --> 05:43.900]  ready to pollinate, uh, amongst many other, uh, several other sexy ladies. He is going
[05:43.900 --> 05:48.460]  to pollinate for the first time cactus cooler for the first time he will pollinate
[05:48.460 --> 05:53.500]  Durban poison, and he will also pollinate a star dog female. So there will be
[05:53.500 --> 05:59.020]  cactus cooler Durban poison and star dog all across to the arise in the near future.
[05:59.020 --> 06:03.340]  That's something I am really excited about. I'm super excited about the star dog
[06:03.340 --> 06:07.900]  because, uh, starting to arise, that's gonna start. Dog's already a great producer.
[06:07.900 --> 06:11.740]  It's already resonance. I think it's going to put more of a funk to the flavor, and it
[06:11.740 --> 06:16.380]  should increase trichomes, and it should increase production. Uh, the Durban poison
[06:16.380 --> 06:22.140]  cross. I'm hoping that that brings out some of that anise and licorice and that funky
[06:22.140 --> 06:26.940]  flavor from the Durban poison into the sweetness and the funkiness of the arise. I think that'll
[06:26.940 --> 06:31.020]  be a very great cross. Now that I'm thinking about it, it's going to be, I have an idea
[06:31.020 --> 06:33.580]  of what it's going to be similar to. I don't know if I want to say it out loud. I want
[06:33.580 --> 06:37.580]  to let other people smoke it and see if they see it also when it's done. Uh, cactus cooler
[06:37.580 --> 06:42.460]  to arise cactus cooler tastes like pineapples and oranges and sweetness, and I'm hoping
[06:42.460 --> 06:47.260]  to bring that out in the arise cactus cooler is already a huge growing plant, so this should
[06:47.260 --> 06:50.700]  be a very interesting cross. This might be something that may be a hit for the outdoor
[06:50.700 --> 06:55.740]  grow season. I'm sure that I'll get several phenotypes that at least have that orangey
[06:55.740 --> 06:59.420]  citrusy pineappley kind of taste to it, and that's what I'm looking for. I want to breed
[06:59.420 --> 07:03.100]  with that a little bit, so those are some of the things that are coming up in my newest
[07:03.100 --> 07:06.620]  breeding project. I like to keep you guys updated. There are, of course, some of the
[07:06.620 --> 07:09.980]  classics. The classic females are in there. The grateful dog is in there to make morning
[07:09.980 --> 07:14.060]  do white widow is in there to make storm shadow cookies and cream is in there to make the
[07:14.060 --> 07:17.820]  cream. There are a couple others in there also, so we're going to restock some of the
[07:17.820 --> 07:21.100]  old stuff and create some new stuff at the same time. Of course, there's a couple of
[07:21.100 --> 07:25.900]  arises in there so we can make some more arise, but everything in that room there's a purpose
[07:25.900 --> 07:30.220]  for that's kind of what I was getting at by talking about my breeding project. Everything
[07:30.220 --> 07:36.220]  in there. I've got a goal and a reason why I'm making it, and I'm also going to start
[07:36.220 --> 07:40.380]  using a new male in the future, so I'm crossing a bunch of the older stuff to have a nice
[07:40.380 --> 07:44.620]  stockpile of some of that and making some new stuff at the same time. Some of the stuff
[07:44.620 --> 07:49.020]  will be made into F2s. The arise that are being made in this room right now will be
[07:49.020 --> 07:54.780]  F2s. There's some new ideas in there. Also, when January comes, they're changing the limits
[07:54.780 --> 07:58.780]  in Colorado, so my rules will be different, so the amounts of plants that I can have will
[07:58.780 --> 08:04.220]  be different, so my idea for breeding, instead of having a large amount of females and one
[08:04.220 --> 08:09.660]  male, I will be using probably two males and a smaller amount of females. That way,
[08:09.660 --> 08:14.220]  I can keep my plant counts legal and be safe and keep myself protected under all the Colorado
[08:14.220 --> 08:16.700]  laws because that's what I need to do. That's one of the most important things that I have
[08:16.700 --> 08:20.940]  to do is make sure I'm legal and protected and safe. Now that they're tightening all
[08:20.940 --> 08:24.460]  the numbers here in Colorado, my breeding will become much more focused. I'll have to
[08:24.460 --> 08:29.420]  think it through a little bit more. I have to use less space, less plants, but it challenges
[08:29.420 --> 08:34.460]  me a little more. You know what? We used to grow when it was completely illegal, so
[08:34.460 --> 08:38.940]  giving me rules and making me work with rules and dance around those rules, I will follow
[08:38.940 --> 08:43.980]  them. I'll stay completely legal, and I'll still do well because I love a good challenge.
[08:43.980 --> 08:48.780]  It's kind of cheating now because you could buy all the gear. You could do it legally.
[08:48.780 --> 08:51.740]  Back in the day, you couldn't even have the gear. You'd get in trouble for having a grow
[08:51.740 --> 08:54.860]  light. Now, you can have the shit and grow as long as you're not growing too much. As
[08:54.860 --> 08:58.220]  long as they're going to let me grow a certain amount, I'll do it. I like the challenge.
[08:58.780 --> 09:02.300]  They're making me think a little more. It sounds fun. I'm ready. Let's do it.
[09:02.300 --> 09:05.180]  But anyway, my breeding projects are going to tighten up a little bit. You're going to
[09:05.180 --> 09:08.060]  see a little bit of different stuff coming from me pretty soon. You're going to see a
[09:08.060 --> 09:12.460]  different male enter the scene pretty soon. There's actually a feminized project coming
[09:12.460 --> 09:15.740]  up. I haven't done much feminized stuff. No, it will not be the Grateful Dog. It will be
[09:15.740 --> 09:21.100]  something brand new, but we'll talk about that when that time comes. Anyway, I feel
[09:21.100 --> 09:24.860]  like the main topic of this show may take a little bit of time, so we should work our
[09:24.860 --> 09:28.460]  way into it. Did I cover all the opening stuff? I think we did. If not, we'll talk
[09:28.460 --> 09:33.180]  about it next time. Let's talk about the main topic of the show. I was on Instagram Live.
[09:33.180 --> 09:37.500]  If you don't follow me on Instagram, you should follow me on Instagram. It's Irie Genetics,
[09:37.500 --> 09:44.460]  Irie underscore genetics, I R I E underscore G E N E T I C S. Follow me on Instagram. You
[09:44.460 --> 09:50.060]  can check out my Instagram Live videos. In my Instagram Live videos, I let people ask
[09:50.060 --> 09:53.900]  random questions, and then I try to answer them to the best of my ability with no preparation,
[09:53.900 --> 09:58.700]  with no notes, just off the top of my head. I try to give them the best advice and guidance
[09:58.700 --> 10:03.660]  I can. We have a lot of fun times talking. Sometimes we take a bunch of dabs, or I take
[10:03.660 --> 10:06.940]  a bunch of dabs. I don't know what everybody else does, but I take dabs. I eat edibles
[10:06.940 --> 10:12.300]  and hang out. Somebody on one of my Instagram Live videos asked me to talk about what F1
[10:12.300 --> 10:17.260]  means and what IBL means and all that type of stuff. I did give a brief explanation there
[10:17.260 --> 10:22.540]  on Instagram Live, but I feel like it would be a great podcast episode. I took a few notes.
[10:22.540 --> 10:25.980]  I did write some of this stuff down so that I actually sound like I know what I'm talking about.
[10:25.980 --> 10:29.660]  They told me that I got it all right on the Instagram Live video. I just pulled it out of
[10:29.660 --> 10:32.860]  my ass and shot it out off the top of my head, and I hope I got it right. They all said I did.
[10:33.980 --> 10:38.380]  I was proud of myself there. I made notes this time so that we can talk about what LAN races are,
[10:38.380 --> 10:43.660]  what an IBL, what an F1 through F5 and so forth. Then we'll talk about a few other things.
[10:44.860 --> 10:48.380]  If you don't know what I'm talking about, here's where I'm headed with this. If you go to shop for
[10:48.380 --> 10:52.620]  seeds, if you're looking to buy a new package of seeds and you want to grow something new,
[10:52.620 --> 10:56.540]  there's a whole bunch of letters and numbers on the package that may not make sense.
[10:56.540 --> 11:01.260]  You'll see... Let me just pick across that. I want to go random, but I'm going to pick something of
[11:01.260 --> 11:09.100]  mine, of course. Let's say Storm Shadow. Storm Shadow is White Widow cross to the Arise. That's
[11:09.100 --> 11:15.100]  kind of an F1. It's also kind of a polyhybrid. I would just write Storm Shadow X Arise. That would
[11:15.180 --> 11:20.700]  show you Storm Shadow to Arise. It should always be listed with Ladies First. Whichever female
[11:20.700 --> 11:24.860]  plant was used, since the Storm Shadow was the girl plant, Ladies First. Storm Shadow... Or,
[11:24.860 --> 11:30.460]  White Widow. I'm sorry. The White Widow was the female plant. White Widow X Arise. Now, it's a
[11:30.460 --> 11:33.820]  White Widow girl. That's obvious because the girls... Ladies First is how it goes when you're
[11:33.820 --> 11:41.020]  listing genetics. White Widow X Arise. Now, a lot of breeders will put either an F1 or an F2 after
[11:41.020 --> 11:46.220]  that. Now, if you're going to put an F1 or an F2, you have to put the White Widow to Arise,
[11:46.220 --> 11:51.820]  White Widow X Arise in parentheses, and then put F1 or F2 next to that. Because that will indicate
[11:51.820 --> 11:56.620]  that that whole cross, it's the F2 of that cross. Now, let me talk about what... I know that may
[11:56.620 --> 12:01.980]  sound confusing, but it'll make more sense when I start talking about what an F1 is. What an F1?
[12:01.980 --> 12:08.540]  F1... F stands for filial. The filial generation number one. If I take... You create an F1 by
[12:08.540 --> 12:13.020]  crossing two different parents, and when you indicate parents when you're listing genetics,
[12:13.020 --> 12:18.060]  it is a P. The letter P represents parent. Excuse the throat clearing, you guys. That
[12:18.060 --> 12:23.020]  big dab is still getting me. So, crossing two different parents will result in an F1,
[12:23.580 --> 12:29.020]  and those parents should be either inbred lines or land races, and those will make F1s. A lot of
[12:29.020 --> 12:32.620]  what you're buying now are polyhybrids, and we're going to talk about that a little bit later in
[12:32.620 --> 12:40.060]  the episode. But two F... Crossing two different strains that are either stabilized IBLs or
[12:40.060 --> 12:45.500]  stabilized land races will make your F1. F1s, the first cross. If you take two different things,
[12:45.500 --> 12:50.460]  a boy and a girl, and cross them, filial generation one. Brand new shit. That new new is F1.
[12:50.460 --> 12:56.460]  All right? So, F1s are cool because they have hybrid vigor, which means it's two new things
[12:56.460 --> 12:59.900]  that have finally hit, and there's so much new energy in there. Those plants are going to grow
[12:59.900 --> 13:05.740]  huge. They're going to grow better than your parents. So, hybrid vigor is going to come out
[13:05.740 --> 13:11.020]  of there. F1 is semi-stable in phenotypes. You're going to see phenotypes that look like mommy.
[13:11.020 --> 13:14.540]  You're going to see phenotypes that look like daddy. You're going to see some that mix,
[13:14.540 --> 13:18.860]  and then you're going to see some that are widely different, like way off there. But you're going
[13:18.860 --> 13:24.380]  to get pretty close to mommy and daddy, and then the crosses. You'll probably... 25% mommy, 25%
[13:24.380 --> 13:30.060]  daddy, 25% a perfect cross, and then 25% of them are just going to be fucking whatever.
[13:30.780 --> 13:35.420]  Whatever genetics are in there, you'll see crosses of all kinds of weird shit in 25% of them,
[13:35.420 --> 13:40.140]  and that's a guess, you guys. I can only estimate on genetics on what you're going to see,
[13:40.860 --> 13:44.780]  but on average, that's kind of what you can expect. So, F1s are cool because they've got
[13:44.780 --> 13:49.020]  that hybrid vigor. You're going to see a lot of cool phenotypes from an F1 hybrid,
[13:49.020 --> 13:53.900]  and now you've got some brand new shit. That's why F1s are cool. So, now, if you grow,
[13:53.900 --> 13:59.420]  if you take a male and a female of two different strains, and you pollinate the female, and seeds
[13:59.420 --> 14:05.020]  come out, you have now made F1. You take those seeds and you grow them, and you can either just
[14:05.020 --> 14:08.700]  leave them open, and you can have all the males and all the girls together, or you can take a
[14:08.700 --> 14:13.740]  select male and a select girl, or you can take a select male and several select girls, and you can
[14:13.740 --> 14:20.300]  pollinate that way. So, it's either open pollination of a whole bunch of F1s, or selective breeding of
[14:20.300 --> 14:26.060]  F1s. If you pollinate that together, the seeds that come out of the F1s, if you take a seed from
[14:26.060 --> 14:29.580]  F1 and a seed from F1, and one's a boy, one's a girl, or there's a cluster of boys and girls,
[14:29.580 --> 14:36.380]  the seeds that come from that are F2, filial generation F2. Now, those you're going to have
[14:36.940 --> 14:41.500]  a little more stabilization than the F1s. They're going to get a little bit closer,
[14:41.500 --> 14:46.460]  but you're going to see some random shit in there. You're going to have 50% mom, 50% dad,
[14:46.460 --> 14:53.180]  and then some variation in there. F2s are always... It depends on how the selective breeding process
[14:53.180 --> 14:56.860]  went. If you do an open pollination, you're going to get a whole bunch of different phenotypes.
[14:56.860 --> 15:01.500]  Some people like that. If you did a selective breeding, you're going to see less different
[15:01.500 --> 15:07.420]  variation in the phenotypes. So, now if I take my favorite male and my favorite female from that F2,
[15:07.420 --> 15:13.100]  and I breed them, now I've just made an F3. And you continue doing that. You can continue doing
[15:13.100 --> 15:18.140]  that until you reach whatever number you'd like. But by the time you get to the F4, the F5
[15:18.140 --> 15:23.740]  generation, if you've done your breeding correctly, things will start coming out like clones. If you
[15:23.740 --> 15:30.620]  plant 50 seeds and 25 are male, because these are regular, these are non-feminized. If you plant 50,
[15:30.620 --> 15:36.380]  25 of them, about 25, you're going to get 50%. 25 will be males, and then 25 of them are going to
[15:36.380 --> 15:40.620]  look almost like clones. They're going to be very identical if you've done your breeding properly.
[15:41.180 --> 15:45.740]  Now, if you keep breeding, you work on what is known as an inbred line, because you are just
[15:45.740 --> 15:49.580]  inbreeding, which means you are actually eliminating traits because you are breeding for
[15:49.580 --> 15:54.140]  selective traits, and you're narrowing it down to where you're just inbreeding and inbreeding to get
[15:54.140 --> 15:59.580]  the perfect plant. Now, that's when you've created an inbred line. An inbred line, also known as an
[15:59.580 --> 16:05.180]  IBL, you guys, an inbred line are hybrids or crosses that have been stabilized to show very
[16:05.180 --> 16:09.180]  little variation. Like I was talking about, they almost look like you're making clones.
[16:10.140 --> 16:16.060]  You inbreed by just selecting the plant that looks just like you want, and then breed that one,
[16:16.060 --> 16:19.900]  and then pull the seeds out, and then grow one, and find one that looks just like what you want,
[16:19.900 --> 16:24.620]  and then make F4 of that, and then find ones that look just like what you want,
[16:24.620 --> 16:28.540]  make the F5 of that. By the time you get to F5, they're all going to start looking like
[16:28.540 --> 16:32.540]  how you want them to. You're inbreeding it to get exactly where you want it. You may need to
[16:32.540 --> 16:37.820]  go further. You may need to go F6. You may need to go F7. I personally have never seen anybody go
[16:37.820 --> 16:42.940]  past an F5 that I know of, but it would be interesting to see what happens. F5 seems to
[16:42.940 --> 16:47.100]  be far enough to get these seeds completely stabilized to make them how we want them.
[16:47.100 --> 16:51.580]  DJ Short said if he goes past F5, when he sells them, it doesn't leave any work for the public
[16:51.580 --> 16:56.060]  to breed with them. There's nothing left. They all come out looking just like what he did if he goes
[16:56.060 --> 17:02.700]  to the F6. I guess DJ Short has gone F6, and he just goes back to the F5 and releases those. He's
[17:02.700 --> 17:06.780]  probably ... He's been breeding for longer than I've been alive, I think, so he's probably got
[17:06.780 --> 17:11.260]  some F7s, F9s, or some shit in his arsenal. He just doesn't release them or talk about them too
[17:11.260 --> 17:16.060]  much. Anyway, that's when you get yourself to an IBL, an inbred line, is when you've inbred it so
[17:16.060 --> 17:20.780]  much that it's super stabilized to where almost every seed you plant comes out looking like a
[17:20.780 --> 17:26.220]  clone of the last seed you planted or the next seed you're going to plant from that same filial
[17:26.220 --> 17:33.420]  generation. A very common way to find an inbred plant or an IBL line, an inbred line, is a land
[17:33.500 --> 17:41.100]  race. Land races are purebred lines from specific areas. A lot of people know about Durban poison.
[17:41.100 --> 17:47.420]  The legendary Durban poison is a land race from the Durban area of Africa. It's very stabilized.
[17:48.140 --> 17:53.900]  It probably came ... I don't know how accurate this is, you guys. This is what my ... If I had
[17:53.900 --> 17:58.940]  to make up a story of a land race plant, this is what it would be. Somewhere, somebody traveled to
[17:58.940 --> 18:04.300]  a place and they gave somebody some weed. That person smoked that weed. They're like, holy shit.
[18:04.300 --> 18:07.980]  This is thousands of years ago in my mind. I don't know how long. Honestly, I don't know. I'm making
[18:07.980 --> 18:13.100]  up this vision in my head right now. Two people that spoke different languages from different
[18:13.100 --> 18:19.180]  villages were traveling somewhere. One guy brought a bunch of weed. Not even a bunch, just some.
[18:19.180 --> 18:24.140]  He shared some weed with this guy in this other village. He got five seeds out of it. That guy
[18:24.140 --> 18:27.660]  smoked that weed. He's like, holy shit, that shit was good. I have to grow those fucking seeds.
[18:27.660 --> 18:31.980]  He grew the seeds. He didn't know anything about pulling males because this was way back in the day.
[18:31.980 --> 18:36.860]  They didn't worry about that. They didn't know they wanted sensimilia buds. He grew all five
[18:36.860 --> 18:41.260]  seeds and they got crossed. The males and the females all bred with each other. The seeds fell
[18:41.260 --> 18:47.260]  into the ground just like it's supposed to. Now he had like a thousand seeds just sprout up next year.
[18:47.900 --> 18:52.780]  He's like, oh shit, that's a lot. He cut down some. The males and females that survived,
[18:52.780 --> 18:59.260]  they bred again. It happened year after year after year. This guy only had one strain of
[18:59.260 --> 19:05.500]  herb on his property for however many years he grew weed. Then his son took over and his son
[19:05.500 --> 19:09.980]  grew that same strain on that property. Maybe nature did it. Maybe the people that grew it
[19:09.980 --> 19:15.420]  a hundred thousand years ago died and nature took over. It's been nature F27 to this fucking plant
[19:15.420 --> 19:18.940]  out there without anybody intervening because that's what cannabis would do if nobody got in
[19:18.940 --> 19:23.180]  the way. It would just keep going year after year after year. Maybe this plant's on like F200.
[19:24.540 --> 19:28.940]  That's a land race. That's an inbred land race. It's inbred itself so far.
[19:31.180 --> 19:35.020]  Every seed that you plant is going to look and smell just like that. That's what I think a land
[19:35.020 --> 19:41.980]  race is. I think an inbred line and a land race are very similar. I think inbreds are done human
[19:41.980 --> 19:48.860]  and a land race was done by nature over a course of time before humans intervened. Imagine traveling
[19:49.580 --> 19:53.340]  way back in the day. Whatever you believe the earth was like, it's round. Whatever the fuck
[19:53.340 --> 19:57.340]  you believe right now, it was still round then. It's still round now. People are traveling around
[19:57.340 --> 20:01.820]  it then. It could be one piece of continent. It could be a broken up bunch of continents. It could
[20:01.820 --> 20:04.860]  be whatever you believe that way as long as you agree that it's fucking round. Come on.
[20:05.820 --> 20:09.980]  Somebody got some herbs somewhere and they traveled around. Obviously, they dropped some
[20:09.980 --> 20:13.740]  off in Thailand because there's Thailand races. They dropped some off in Brazil because there's
[20:13.740 --> 20:20.060]  Brazilian land races. They just dropped off a few seeds and it F37 itself. I'm just being
[20:20.060 --> 20:24.140]  hypothetical with the F37s and whatever, but that's what happened. Somebody traveled around
[20:24.140 --> 20:28.860]  with a little bit of weed and it got dropped off in all these places. Vietnam because there's
[20:28.860 --> 20:33.180]  Vietnamese land races. Of course, there's Afghan land races. There are land races everywhere.
[20:33.180 --> 20:37.500]  There are Mexican land races. Mexican sativa land races are fucking amazing. It's funny because
[20:37.500 --> 20:41.740]  people are afraid of Mexican land races because they think it's going to be swagweed just because
[20:41.740 --> 20:45.740]  most of the weed they bought from Mexico was compressed. That doesn't make any fucking sense.
[20:45.740 --> 20:51.340]  I just think it's hilarious. That's my take on a land race. Seeds got traveled around way back
[20:51.340 --> 20:56.540]  before it was common for people to get around a whole bunch. They were unadulterated and they just
[20:56.540 --> 21:02.220]  bred themselves either with the help of a local farmer or by nature, but there were no more seeds
[21:02.220 --> 21:07.820]  introduced. There were no more variations or no more varietals introduced to that to breed,
[21:08.380 --> 21:13.260]  to outbreed that, to outcross it. That's a land race. It just stayed the same and kept
[21:13.260 --> 21:18.380]  stabilizing itself and getting better and better over time. That's what it is. Those genetics are
[21:18.380 --> 21:24.460]  those genetics. They never got adulterated. That's land races in bread lines and filial
[21:24.460 --> 21:31.180]  generations one through five. Now, let's talk about something else you might see on a seed pack
[21:31.260 --> 21:40.940]  is BX. BX stands for bat crossing. Now, bat crossing would be if I took an F1. If I cross
[21:40.940 --> 21:46.140]  some stuff, let's say we'll just go with the golden goat to the daybreaker, cross those,
[21:46.140 --> 21:55.660]  you make an Arise F1. Now, if I took an Arise F1 seed and pollinated it with the original daybreaker
[21:55.660 --> 21:59.660]  male, that would be a bat cross. That was really confusing for me to do because I was trying to
[21:59.660 --> 22:04.220]  make all the different names of the strains as I did it. I'm going to say it again just to make
[22:04.220 --> 22:07.100]  sure I get it right. I'm going to read my notes without using strain names. Bat crossing is
[22:07.100 --> 22:12.540]  crossing an F1 back to an original parent, you guys. You make an F1 with a boy and a girl,
[22:12.540 --> 22:17.500]  the baby comes out, and then you either can cross it back to the boy or back to the dad or back to
[22:17.500 --> 22:22.940]  the mom. That's a bat cross. Now, people might say, why would you want to do that? I've got a
[22:22.940 --> 22:26.860]  good explanation of why. This will lead me into BX2, which is a bat cross number two.
[22:26.940 --> 22:31.580]  Let's say you want to make seeds that are not feminized because if you want them to be
[22:31.580 --> 22:36.780]  feminized, it's a different process. If you want regular seeds of a strain that is clone only and
[22:36.780 --> 22:42.380]  you have a female of it but you don't have a male of it, what you can do is create a bat cross.
[22:43.260 --> 22:49.260]  Perhaps I want to make Grateful Dog. There is not a male of Grateful Dog. I've only got a female of
[22:49.260 --> 22:54.700]  Grateful Dog. Maybe I want to make Grateful Dog seeds that are not feminized because I made
[22:54.940 --> 22:59.980]  feminized seeds. That's the only way it's available is feminized Grateful Dog. Let's say I want to
[22:59.980 --> 23:05.340]  make my favorite Grateful Dog female that I've got. I want to make it available in regular seeds.
[23:05.340 --> 23:10.620]  I would find something that is similar to it, kind of similar to it, or maybe I'd find,
[23:10.620 --> 23:14.380]  I don't know. There's two different routes to go there. I would cross it with a male. I would find
[23:14.380 --> 23:19.420]  a male. If you cross it with a male that's very similar to it, it's going to be harder to find
[23:19.420 --> 23:24.220]  the male that looks like the Grateful Dog to reuse for the BX. If you cross it to a male that's very
[23:24.220 --> 23:27.820]  different, the one that's closer to the Grateful Dog will stand out and it will be easier to
[23:27.820 --> 23:34.940]  determine which one to bat cross with. That's a whole lot of different talking. For this example,
[23:34.940 --> 23:39.340]  we're going to take the Grateful Dog female. Since I've got the Arise male on my mind,
[23:39.340 --> 23:44.300]  we're going to use the Arise male. We're going to pollinate that Grateful Dog with the Arise.
[23:44.300 --> 23:50.700]  Now we have just made, that's actually Morning Dew. Now let's take Morning Dew and find a Morning
[23:50.700 --> 23:56.540]  Dew male. I want to find a male out of this Morning Dew that looks just like the Grateful
[23:56.540 --> 24:02.460]  Dog. Now I've got a male Grateful Dog kind of looking plant and I want to pollinate that female
[24:02.460 --> 24:09.580]  Grateful Dog. Now I have just made a BX. I've made a bat cross. Now there's another way you could do
[24:09.580 --> 24:14.700]  that. I could take one of those Morning Dew seeds and I could find a female that looks just like the
[24:14.700 --> 24:20.540]  Grateful Dog. Then I can take that original Arise pollen and throw that on there again. Then that's
[24:20.540 --> 24:24.860]  going to make more seeds that would actually be a bat cross again, but it's not the way I was trying
[24:24.860 --> 24:29.260]  to go. I was trying to make the Grateful Dog. I think by finding the male that looks like the
[24:29.260 --> 24:33.900]  Grateful Dog and putting it back on the Grateful Dog female, I'm going to be putting so many
[24:33.900 --> 24:39.820]  Grateful Dog dominant genetics into there. I think it's going to be very Grateful Dog dominant. Then
[24:39.820 --> 24:45.980]  I will take seeds that come from that. Now I have taken the Morning Dew male that looks like
[24:45.980 --> 24:52.700]  Grateful Dog and I put it back onto the Grateful Dog female. Now I have made Grateful Dog BX1
[24:52.700 --> 24:58.540]  because I have gone backwards and used the Grateful Dog female that was in there. I'm bat crossing.
[24:58.540 --> 25:02.460]  You can do it with the male. You can do it with the female. Either way it works, but my goal right
[25:02.460 --> 25:08.300]  now is to try to make that Grateful Dog in regular seed. Now I have made the Morning Dew to the
[25:08.300 --> 25:14.060]  Grateful Dog bat cross. Now I would take seeds that come from that. I would grow those BX1s
[25:14.060 --> 25:20.620]  and find one that looks just like a Grateful Dog. Once again, I would bat cross. I'm going to find
[25:20.620 --> 25:24.700]  a male and I'm going to take that male that looks like the Grateful Dog and I'm going to put that
[25:24.700 --> 25:32.940]  pollen on my female Grateful Dog. Now I have made Grateful Dog BX2 regular seed. That's what that
[25:32.940 --> 25:37.420]  would be. You guys, I'm going to press pause. I'm going to take a drink and a dab. I'm actually
[25:37.420 --> 25:41.900]  going to listen back to this and make sure I feel like I got this right. If you've got any comments
[25:41.900 --> 25:47.260]  or concerns on what I've just said, I would love all of your input. You can send me an email. It's
[25:47.260 --> 25:53.500]  growfromyourheart at hotmail.com or of course you can send me a tweet at GFYH podcast on Twitter
[25:53.500 --> 25:57.820]  or you can find me on Facebook. Look for the Grow From Your Heart podcast on Facebook. I love the
[25:57.820 --> 26:01.900]  interaction because I'm going to press pause. I'm going to take a drink. I'm going to dab some of
[26:01.900 --> 26:13.000]  this Tahoe batter and then I'll be right back. All right, podcast world, I am back. I listened
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.920]  back to everything I said and I feel like I was accurate in what I spoke. I'm going to continue.
[26:18.920 --> 26:25.720]  Another thing we need to talk about are feminized seeds. Now, feminized seeds are labeled differently
[26:25.720 --> 26:30.520]  or at least they should be. They aren't oftentimes labeled correctly is what I've noticed, but that's
[26:30.520 --> 26:36.680]  up to individual breeders. I feel like they should be labeled as feminized at least. Then
[26:36.680 --> 26:41.640]  the correct, if you're labeling them genetics wise to list what they are, like on a website,
[26:41.640 --> 26:49.000]  if you're going to say, hey, this crosses this to this, it would be an S1 if you took a, and we're
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.760]  just going to pick a random strain that we keep playing with, the grateful dog. If I took the
[26:52.760 --> 26:59.080]  grateful dog and I reversed it, which would mean I treated it with silver thiosulfate or gibberellic
[26:59.080 --> 27:04.840]  acid or maybe the other type of silver, colloidal silver, which I don't feel works well enough. I
[27:04.840 --> 27:10.360]  did the silver thiosulfate myself, but if you treated the grateful dog plant and pollinated
[27:10.360 --> 27:14.840]  another clone of the grateful dog, the same plant, it's got to be the same cultivar. You have to
[27:14.840 --> 27:21.080]  reverse one and pollinate one that is the same cultivar that is reversing the same cut and
[27:21.080 --> 27:27.400]  pollinating the same cut. You are now making S1s. That is a self seed that is an S1 is what that is.
[27:28.200 --> 27:35.160]  If you reverse a strain and make seeds of itself, you are making S1s. Now, if I were to reverse that
[27:35.160 --> 27:41.880]  grateful dog and take that grateful dog pollen that is now feminized pollen and I put that pollen
[27:41.880 --> 27:48.120]  on any plant other than the grateful dog, I am making what is known as an R1, a reversal one.
[27:48.120 --> 27:54.680]  I'm using feminized pollen on a different cut to create new feminized polyhybrids is basically what
[27:54.680 --> 28:01.880]  I'm doing. Those are two that you need to know about, S1 and R1. Now, earlier I said something
[28:01.880 --> 28:08.040]  about breeding with land races and breeding with inbred lines. A lot of what you see available in
[28:08.040 --> 28:12.760]  the seed catalogs and I read genetics included, I'm not calling anybody out. I am part of this
[28:12.760 --> 28:18.680]  group. A lot of what we are breeding is actually polyhybrids. We're taking F1s and F2s, possibly
[28:18.680 --> 28:25.880]  F3s and breeding them to other F1s or F2s. They are not completely stabilized plants that are
[28:25.880 --> 28:31.160]  being used for breeding. Although, through experimentation and testing, those plants have
[28:31.160 --> 28:35.640]  been tested well enough for my approval to be used in breeding. I know they're not going to
[28:35.640 --> 28:42.120]  hermaphrodite on me. I know that the progeny they create is not problematic. So, yes, they are
[28:42.120 --> 28:48.840]  polyhybrids, but they are stable enough. Most of us breeders are aware enough and educated enough
[28:48.840 --> 28:54.440]  and experienced enough to know if that strain is worth crossing or not. It would be a good idea for
[28:54.440 --> 29:00.200]  us to breed something to the F5 before we crossed it to something else. That would make a true F1.
[29:00.200 --> 29:04.280]  But the polyhybrids is kind of where the market has gone to now. It's kind of where
[29:04.280 --> 29:09.160]  cannabis breeding has gone to now. It's got its pros and its cons.
[29:10.200 --> 29:15.720]  So now that you know all of the glossary words, we've got a land race, we've got an IBL, which
[29:15.720 --> 29:21.240]  means an inbred line. We've got F1s, F2s, all the way up to F5s when you start becoming an IBL,
[29:21.240 --> 29:27.560]  basically. You can go F6 or 7. I talked about nature probably doing F50. You never know,
[29:27.560 --> 29:31.720]  honestly. I really don't know. There's probably somewhere in some jungle or on some island that
[29:31.720 --> 29:35.880]  those plants have just been making their finial generations without interruption that we don't
[29:35.880 --> 29:41.240]  even know about yet. So you've got the F generations. Then we've got back crosses,
[29:41.240 --> 29:46.520]  which is when you take an F1 back to the parent. And then you've got a back cross 2 is when you
[29:46.520 --> 29:51.880]  take a BX1 back to the parent. Then we have got the self, which is when we start playing with
[29:51.880 --> 29:56.920]  feminized seeds. Then you've got the R1. Then we've got polyhybrids, which is mostly what we're
[29:56.920 --> 30:00.840]  seeing on the market. Now that we've got all these glossary terms, let's talk a little bit about the
[30:00.840 --> 30:07.560]  labeling on seed packages. A lot of the companies do it differently. I myself will list Golden Goat
[30:08.360 --> 30:14.040]  X Daybreaker. And then it will say Arise, because that's Golden Goat crossed the Daybreaker. That
[30:14.040 --> 30:19.080]  makes Arise. That's what you're going to get. There are other breeders who will list, that would
[30:19.080 --> 30:24.520]  list the genetics of the Golden Goat in a parentheses, which would be in one bracket,
[30:24.520 --> 30:28.920]  you'd have a parentheses. And then it would say Island Sweet Skunk X Romulan, then another
[30:28.920 --> 30:34.920]  parentheses. Then it would say Hawaiian Sativa, then another parentheses closing that. So that
[30:34.920 --> 30:41.400]  shows you that it's an Island Sweet Skunk to Romulan female crossed to a Hawaiian Sativa male
[30:41.400 --> 30:46.200]  in one set of parentheses, like a math problem. So you've got parentheses starting it, and then
[30:46.200 --> 30:49.800]  another one closing it, and then another one even closing it. I don't know what direction you call
[30:49.800 --> 30:54.600]  those parentheses. But one part's in a parentheses, and then there's another one on the end of that to
[30:54.600 --> 31:01.240]  make that all one equation. X, the Daybreaker, which is Joseph OG X Chem D, those two would be
[31:01.240 --> 31:06.280]  in parentheses together. So it would show the male, the breakdown of the male, all in parentheses,
[31:06.280 --> 31:12.280]  X, the breakdown of the, or the female, X, the male, all broken down into genetics. That's how
[31:12.280 --> 31:16.440]  some folks do it. Now, sometimes you might see, and I'm going to get hypothetical right now,
[31:16.440 --> 31:25.000]  you may see just a pack labeled Arise BX2. Now, that means the Arise was back-crossed,
[31:25.000 --> 31:31.160]  but that does not indicate what male was used or what female was used in the back-cross. That may
[31:31.160 --> 31:36.440]  be listed in the parentheses underneath. It just depends on how they do it. Now, that means that
[31:36.440 --> 31:44.280]  that is the progeny of the back-cross. It doesn't say, now, they may say Arise BX2 in parentheses,
[31:44.280 --> 31:51.800]  or Arise BX2 X Daybreaker in parentheses, and that means that the Arise BX2 was used. So where
[31:51.800 --> 31:57.000]  those parentheses fall kind of indicate which group the plants were in. So everything in the
[31:57.000 --> 32:01.720]  brackets is that plant, and then if it stays inside of another set of brackets, it's still
[32:01.720 --> 32:07.800]  that plant, but it's the male or the female. So I think what I said makes sense, because if you're
[32:07.800 --> 32:12.920]  listing the grandparents, if you're going that far to list your stuff, it's going to be female,
[32:12.920 --> 32:19.000]  X, male, in parentheses, X, female, X, male, in parentheses, and the first set of parentheses will
[32:19.000 --> 32:24.280]  be the female. The second set will be the male. Now, sometimes you're going to see maybe a breeder
[32:24.280 --> 32:29.160]  used something that's got three things in it, because maybe he took a boy and a girl and crossed
[32:29.160 --> 32:34.120]  those, and then crossed those to another boy, and used the offspring of that as a female in the
[32:34.120 --> 32:42.920]  project. So that would have female, X, male, in parentheses, X, male, and then you just put another
[32:42.920 --> 32:47.080]  parentheses to close that, and that would show you that that's your female, and then X, and then
[32:47.080 --> 32:52.200]  whatever your male is on there. I hope I'm explaining that properly. Without writing it down on a dry
[32:52.200 --> 32:56.120]  erase board and showing you what I'm doing, I feel like I might just be confusing you, but keep this
[32:56.120 --> 33:02.360]  in mind. Ladies first, and if it gets too confusing when you're trying to write something down, just
[33:02.360 --> 33:08.280]  make it simpler. Instead of writing all this, Exodus, Exodus, parentheses, just write Golden Goat
[33:08.280 --> 33:13.000]  times Daybreaker, Arise. You'll get right to the point, and it's easier, but I want you to be able
[33:13.000 --> 33:16.360]  to understand it if you do see all these weird labels, because some people try to just make it
[33:16.360 --> 33:20.840]  look fancy. Some folks out there, I'll give a lot of respect and a lot of acknowledgement to Colin
[33:20.840 --> 33:26.440]  Gordon and the Ethos Collective. Those guys labeled their shit correctly. It's a little confusing,
[33:26.440 --> 33:30.040]  but if you're an experienced grower and you know what you're looking at, it makes a lot of sense,
[33:30.040 --> 33:34.760]  and it is very helpful, because they offer different versions of the same line, which can
[33:34.760 --> 33:38.520]  be confusing if you don't know what you're looking at. So I hope you guys learned a whole bunch. I
[33:38.520 --> 33:42.600]  may have just confused you guys a whole bunch more talking to you about how to label things and how
[33:42.600 --> 33:47.560]  to read a seed package. I would honestly love your feedback about this episode. Send me an email.

[34:02.280 --> 34:06.920]  I've talked about land races and inbred lines and all this breeding stuff, I want to talk about
[34:07.560 --> 34:11.400]  something that I've seen in a couple of videos. Now, there's a breeder, a group of breeders that
[34:11.400 --> 34:15.640]  travel around the world, and they like to go to places, and I'm not hating on them. I'm just
[34:15.640 --> 34:20.760]  bringing this up to spark conversation. I actually respect these folks. They do great work.
[34:20.760 --> 34:24.360]  They've done a lot of work for the cannabis community and the industry. Let me say that
[34:24.360 --> 34:27.240]  before I kind of say what I'm going to say, and then we'll talk about it. I want to make a
[34:27.240 --> 34:33.480]  conversation out of this. So these breeders, they travel around the world, and they go to places
[34:34.040 --> 34:38.680]  like Africa, like Jamaica. They've gone all over the fucking world, to tell you the truth. They go
[34:38.680 --> 34:42.520]  everywhere. They've got a lot of money, and they've got private jets, and they know a lot of people.
[34:42.520 --> 34:48.040]  They get all over the fucking world. So these guys get access to go visit very large outdoor
[34:48.040 --> 34:54.600]  ganja farms all over the planet. Now, a lot of these outdoor ganja farms are older than me. They
[34:54.600 --> 34:59.880]  are older than these guys that are going to visit. These are the places where the land race strains
[34:59.880 --> 35:04.760]  are being grown just organically. These guys didn't have access to any other seeds. Nobody
[35:04.760 --> 35:09.400]  goes there. Nobody that goes there is bringing cannabis seeds. It wasn't like, hey, I should go
[35:09.400 --> 35:14.200]  to Jamaica and take cannabis seeds. Nobody ever said that. Everybody thinks I should go to Jamaica
[35:14.200 --> 35:20.840]  and get cannabis seeds. Nobody takes sand to the beach. So the land race strains, I'm just going to
[35:20.840 --> 35:24.760]  guess Jamaica now because I've said that. That's going to be what we stick with. The land race
[35:24.760 --> 35:28.680]  that is growing in Jamaica that these folks went down there and found, they went through it, and
[35:28.680 --> 35:32.440]  they were like, this one. This one's fucking awesome. And they broke open a couple of buds,
[35:32.440 --> 35:35.480]  and they told the guy that owned the farm, they're like, can I take these seeds? And the guy was
[35:35.560 --> 35:41.080]  like, oh yeah, you could take plenty of seeds. So now this breeder brought home a big old jar
[35:41.080 --> 35:45.960]  of Jamaican land race seeds. Fucking awesome. Cool. Now he's got them. They're preserved. He's
[35:45.960 --> 35:51.160]  going to breed with them. He bred them to the next filial generation. He actually sold them
[35:51.160 --> 35:55.080]  through his website and through his breeding company, through his seed company and in his
[35:55.080 --> 36:00.760]  coffee shops in Amsterdam. Now, here's what he did in return. He reached into his pocket,
[36:00.760 --> 36:06.360]  and he offered this farmer handfuls of his own seed that he has bred. Now this company
[36:06.360 --> 36:11.960]  color coats all of their seeds. They've got a product that, so they make a product strain called,
[36:11.960 --> 36:14.040]  and you're going to figure out who I'm talking about. If you know what I'm talking about,
[36:14.040 --> 36:17.800]  but I'm just not going to say their name. They make super lemon Hays. They coat all of their
[36:17.800 --> 36:22.520]  super lemon Hay seeds in a yellow coating so that you can just put them in a baggie and carry them,
[36:22.520 --> 36:26.520]  and they don't have to be labeled. And you know, those yellow seeds are super lemon Hays.
[36:26.520 --> 36:30.200]  And then they coat all of the, each strain's got its own color. And I don't know what the colors
[36:30.200 --> 36:33.720]  for all of them are. It's just obvious that super lemon Hays was the yellow one. That's what I
[36:33.720 --> 36:39.320]  remember. So he reaches into his pocket and pulls out what looks like a bag of M&Ms and it's just
[36:39.320 --> 36:44.360]  colored, feminized and regular seeds. And he puts them in the farmer's hand and says, thank you for
[36:44.360 --> 36:51.720]  the trade. Grow these next year. Now, great trade, right? Really cool. Our friend with the seed
[36:51.720 --> 36:56.760]  company has now got some great new Jamaican land race genetics. The Jamaican guy has now got some
[36:56.760 --> 37:01.560]  new shit to grow. The problem is, and I don't know if it's a problem. I'm just curious about
[37:01.560 --> 37:07.480]  this. And I want to know how you guys feel. That land race in Jamaica that's been growing there
[37:07.480 --> 37:15.400]  forever on that Island without human adulteration has been inbreeding itself and making itself
[37:15.400 --> 37:19.960]  perfect for that climate. And it produces the product that they're familiar with every year.
[37:19.960 --> 37:26.040]  And it drops seeds and it grows and it does it again. Now has this breeding company, has this
[37:26.040 --> 37:32.440]  seed sharer adulterated that land race by dropping off these other seeds on this Island? Because the
[37:32.440 --> 37:36.600]  pollen is going to travel. Is everything going to get pollinated by these other seeds that he left?
[37:36.600 --> 37:40.040]  Because there were feminized and non-feminized. There were regular seeds in there. So there will
[37:40.040 --> 37:45.720]  be males to pull. And these guys do not pull males. They throw out so many seeds and they
[37:45.720 --> 37:51.560]  just let it grow naturally. They don't call any seeds because they want the seeds for next year.
[37:51.560 --> 37:54.680]  They want them to fall and then they want the seeds that they can grow dope next year because
[37:54.680 --> 37:58.680]  they don't go get seeds from anybody. That's not what they do. They've just been using this inbred
[37:58.680 --> 38:02.840]  land race. So I kind of want your interaction on this. How do you guys feel about this? Are they
[38:02.840 --> 38:07.240]  traveling around the world, adulterating land races while at the same time collecting land
[38:07.240 --> 38:12.600]  race seeds so that they can breed them for their own use? Are they kind of, does that seem like
[38:12.600 --> 38:17.320]  sort of a ploy? Maybe eventually there won't be any land races and until you have to go shop
[38:17.320 --> 38:21.800]  with them to get them because they've traveled all over the world and picked up some of the
[38:21.800 --> 38:26.280]  land race from everywhere and labeled it very well. They've got land races from different regions
[38:26.280 --> 38:30.200]  of different countries. They've got Northern Jamaica, Southern Jamaica land races, and they've
[38:30.200 --> 38:34.600]  got them labeled and they know exactly what they are, but they also dropped off their own seeds
[38:34.600 --> 38:38.280]  there. And I'm sure that those farmers planted it because those farmers probably weren't thinking
[38:38.280 --> 38:42.200]  the way that I think they weren't like, he came to disrupt my land race and he's going to do
[38:42.200 --> 38:46.040]  something to the future of cannabis. I don't know. Is it disrupting their crop? Is it improving their
[38:46.040 --> 38:49.800]  crop? Do you think it's detrimental to their crop? I kind of want your opinion because it just sparked
[38:49.800 --> 38:53.320]  a lot of thoughts in my mind. So I want to know what you think. Interact with me. Let's have a
[38:53.320 --> 38:59.480]  conversation about it. You guys email me, tweet me, social media with me about it and go watch the
[38:59.480 --> 39:02.680]  videos. If you know what I'm talking about, go watch the videos again and see what you think.
[39:02.680 --> 39:08.520]  I'm just curious on your opinion. There's one thing I should say to that. Uh, and I was only
[39:08.520 --> 39:13.880]  just using Jamaica as an example. There are great growers in Jamaica, especially now, but there've
[39:13.880 --> 39:18.040]  always been great growers in Jamaica. Some folks were calling the males. Uh, they were able to get
[39:18.040 --> 39:22.760]  other good seeds in Jamaica, but just a lot of the places that I'm talking about are like
[39:22.760 --> 39:26.600]  mountainside rural places. And if you've seen the videos, these guys have gone to
[39:27.240 --> 39:32.760]  dozens of different countries and gathered cannabis seeds. So also, uh, what can we do about
[39:32.760 --> 39:35.960]  it? I guess if I'm going to start a conversation and bring up a problem, I should have a solution,
[39:35.960 --> 39:41.640]  right? I guess if you are a seed collector, if you are a conservationist or a preserver of cannabis
[39:41.640 --> 39:47.960]  seeds, maybe you should find a good vendor that's got reliable, uh, land race seeds and get your
[39:47.960 --> 39:53.400]  hands on all the land races that you think you may be interested in before they get all adulterated
[39:53.400 --> 39:58.280]  and messed up with the new cannabis revolution because money is getting involved. So everything
[39:58.280 --> 40:04.440]  worldwide is going to change with cannabis. All right, podcast world. That was a fun episode.
[40:04.440 --> 40:07.880]  Thanks for joining me for that. I really did have a good time. I feel like I got to teach you guys a
[40:07.880 --> 40:12.920]  whole bunch. I feel like I got to learn a bunch myself, just doing some research. I feel like also
[40:12.920 --> 40:17.320]  I got to go on the rant about that seed company that I've always wanted to say publicly. I want
[40:17.320 --> 40:22.120]  your opinions. I want your input on that. Uh, let's see. What else do I have? You know what
[40:22.120 --> 40:27.240]  I've got for you? Uh, Patreon. I would appreciate it. Appreciate it. Fuck. I was so smooth until
[40:27.240 --> 40:32.360]  then. I would appreciate it. If you guys went to patreon.com slash grow from your heart and check
[40:32.360 --> 40:36.120]  it out. If you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks a year time, I'm not begging for
[40:36.120 --> 40:39.080]  money. There are a few people out there that have said, Hey, I would love to contribute to the
[40:39.080 --> 40:46.920]  podcast. How can I do so? Patreon is the way you can do it. Go to patreon, P A T R E O N.com slash
[40:46.920 --> 40:50.920]  grow from your heart. All the information you need is right there. You can sign up. You can
[40:50.920 --> 40:55.480]  contribute to the podcast. You can help me cover the cost of hosting the show. The podcast is free.
[40:55.480 --> 40:59.480]  It will always be free for everybody, but some folks would like to help out with the cost of
[40:59.480 --> 41:03.160]  the website. Some people would like to buy me the little fuzzy covers for the microphone. So I don't
[41:03.160 --> 41:07.560]  have to keep spitting into the same one. I can always use a little help with the new equipment
[41:07.560 --> 41:11.640]  and things like that, that I have to upgrade. I buy bottled water for everybody that comes on the
[41:11.640 --> 41:17.320]  show. Stuff like that always helps out. So I would appreciate your help at patreon.com slash grow
[41:17.320 --> 41:21.880]  from your heart. If you can't contribute to Patreon, that's okay. I still love you. I still
[41:21.880 --> 41:26.520]  want you to listen to the show. Keep hanging out, keep learning how to grow cannabis, do your best
[41:26.520 --> 41:30.520]  to improve your garden with the lessons I give you. That's all I really ask for. That's all I
[41:30.520 --> 41:34.760]  want back is that you love cannabis, that you respect cannabis, that you treat cannabis in a
[41:34.760 --> 41:39.560]  good way, and that you only share positive stuff with cannabis to the public. Don't make cannabis
[41:39.560 --> 41:44.200]  look bad ever. Don't be too high and do some dumb shit. Don't ever do some dumb shit and blame it
[41:44.200 --> 41:49.320]  on being high. Just always support cannabis in a positive light. That's all I ask for in return for
[41:49.320 --> 41:54.440]  this podcast. There are a few people that can help out with Patreon. Thank you. I appreciate it. If
[41:54.440 --> 41:59.880]  you can't, keep listening, dude. Join me. It's free. It's a party. Everybody's invited. Also, what you
[41:59.880 --> 42:03.400]  can do for free is you can find me on Facebook, search for the Grow From Your Heart Podcast. You
[42:03.400 --> 42:08.120]  can find me on Twitter at GFYH Podcast. Of course, follow me on Instagram so you can be a part of
[42:08.120 --> 42:13.720]  those Instagram live videos. It's Irie underscore genetics. Don't forget about YouTube. There is a
[42:13.720 --> 42:19.000]  YouTube channel, the Grow From Your Heart Podcast YouTube channel. There are approximately 130-ish
[42:19.000 --> 42:25.000]  videos up right now. I'm making more. It takes a long time to get them up there. All right. I want
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.320]  to thank everybody once again for listening to a long, rambly podcast. I will be back Thursday with
[42:29.320 --> 42:33.640]  a throwback Thursday episode. Thanks again for listening to those long episodes. Let me know what
[42:33.640 --> 42:39.240]  you think about those also, please. Then, of course, I will be back Monday with a brand new episode.
[42:39.800 --> 42:43.960]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Jay Dennis. Until next time, take a fat dab
[42:43.960 --> 42:47.640]  and give your mom a hug for me.
