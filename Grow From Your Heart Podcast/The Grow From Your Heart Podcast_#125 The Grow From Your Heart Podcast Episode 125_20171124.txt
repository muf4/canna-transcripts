[00:16.960 --> 00:19.520]  Yeah. Welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.520 --> 00:23.080]  It is time for episode number 125 of the grow from your heart podcast,
[00:23.260 --> 00:27.400]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:27.400 --> 00:29.400]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.560 --> 00:31.680]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.920 --> 00:34.960]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:34.960 --> 00:38.560]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.720 --> 00:41.360]  I'm your host. My friends call me Ross DeJeff.
[00:41.360 --> 00:43.800]  I want to thank you once again for joining me as always.
[00:43.840 --> 00:46.900]  I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band
[00:46.900 --> 00:50.660]  for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat,
[00:51.340 --> 00:53.580]  Koot and the entire mystic roots crew. You guys,
[00:53.580 --> 00:57.180]  mystic roots is going on tour this summer. Please support that tour. Uh,
[00:57.220 --> 00:59.300]  check out mysticroots.com. Follow them on Facebook.
[00:59.540 --> 01:02.140]  I will definitely be advertising the Colorado dates.
[01:02.300 --> 01:05.540]  I will be at the Colorado spring show at the black sheep. Looking forward to it.
[01:05.560 --> 01:10.180]  Cannot wait to get down. I hope to see your smiling face there. All right.
[01:10.180 --> 01:12.940]  I hate to start off a podcast like this, but it has happened again. You guys,
[01:13.260 --> 01:15.540]  we have lost a dear friend, my good friend, Mr. Jeff.
[01:16.100 --> 01:18.300]  I don't know if I should say his full name on the show. Jeff, you are gone.
[01:18.300 --> 01:22.220]  I miss you. Um, I can't believe you're gone. It's been a over a week now,
[01:22.220 --> 01:25.900]  and I'm still flabbergasted. I haven't adjusted to you not being around. Uh,
[01:25.940 --> 01:29.180]  so, uh, this episode is dedicated to my good friend, Jeff. I miss you.
[01:29.220 --> 01:33.100]  I'll always love you, bro. Uh, friends, please quit dying. It sucks.
[01:33.100 --> 01:36.020]  It's hard to deal with, but anyway, shout out to Jeff. Much love.
[01:36.020 --> 01:38.100]  I'm going to miss you. Let's move on with the show. You guys,
[01:38.100 --> 01:39.900]  I want to send a huge thank you to our friend,
[01:39.900 --> 01:43.060]  Lindsay who kind of co-hosted the last episode. Uh, Lindsay,
[01:43.060 --> 01:44.420]  I didn't tell you thank you before you left.
[01:44.420 --> 01:47.660]  I did not tell you thank you on the show. Uh, thanks for doing a kick-ass job.
[01:48.260 --> 01:50.980]  Uh, you said that you sounded like a total dork in a comment on Facebook.
[01:50.980 --> 01:53.660]  You did not sound like a total dork. You sounded like a total bad-ass.
[01:53.940 --> 01:57.100]  You are welcome back on the show. Anytime you would like. Um,
[01:57.100 --> 01:59.380]  I sent you a message. You didn't reply. So, uh,
[01:59.380 --> 02:02.180]  we'll see what's up with that after I record. Anyway, come back on the show.
[02:02.180 --> 02:04.100]  Lindsay, also a big shout out to Mike. Uh,
[02:04.140 --> 02:06.180]  thanks for helping me put together a great episode.
[02:06.180 --> 02:09.780]  I could not have done that show without both of your help. So shout out,
[02:09.820 --> 02:14.180]  much respect and big thanks. So I want to start off this episode. Uh,
[02:14.180 --> 02:15.940]  we will do a couple of grow questions,
[02:15.940 --> 02:19.340]  but I want to start off by reading some of the comments that I have got here on
[02:19.340 --> 02:22.260]  iTunes. I'm actually pulling up those comments right now.
[02:22.260 --> 02:24.300]  It's going to take a second. All right.
[02:24.300 --> 02:25.540]  I'm pulling up the comments I'm getting there.
[02:25.780 --> 02:27.380]  If you want to leave a comment on the podcast,
[02:27.380 --> 02:31.340]  all you got to do is go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store, type in,
[02:31.380 --> 02:33.980]  grow from your heart. It'll bring up the grow from your heart podcast.
[02:34.020 --> 02:35.980]  Go down to the bottom, click on podcast,
[02:35.980 --> 02:38.180]  click on the icon that shows my face and the title.
[02:38.500 --> 02:40.980]  And then there will be an area where it says details, ratings,
[02:40.980 --> 02:42.420]  and reviews and related.
[02:43.180 --> 02:45.100]  All you got to do is click on ratings and reviews.
[02:45.500 --> 02:48.060]  That's where I just clicked and I can see all of your reviews.
[02:48.300 --> 02:51.500]  So let's go ahead and read. We've got three new comments. Let's go read three,
[02:51.500 --> 02:53.820]  all three of these new reviews. I'm going to kick down this music.
[02:53.980 --> 02:58.180]  And the first comment says, Oh, I didn't scroll down far enough.
[02:58.180 --> 03:01.020]  That's why that seemed weird. All right. The first comment says it's from our
[03:01.020 --> 03:06.020]  friend J just like a J just like Veda. I know I said that wrong,
[03:06.180 --> 03:09.700]  but I really tried to say it right. Anyway, the comment goes like this.
[03:09.820 --> 03:11.980]  Oh, and we've got a five star rating. Also the comment goes like this.
[03:11.980 --> 03:15.180]  Thanks man for great teaching and your great attitude.
[03:15.180 --> 03:17.900]  I've learned a ton and I hope you continue your great work.
[03:17.980 --> 03:20.180]  Episode one 13 is amazing by the way,
[03:20.180 --> 03:23.140]  and I'm sure it will help me more than I can now foresee.
[03:23.140 --> 03:27.860]  Once I have those checklists set up for use, peace out old man, John.
[03:28.940 --> 03:30.860]  Hey John, I'm glad episode one 13 helped you out.
[03:30.860 --> 03:33.900]  I'm glad that grow room checklist is going to come in handy for you.
[03:34.340 --> 03:37.540]  I've done episodes about planning your grow room and I've done episodes about
[03:37.580 --> 03:41.660]  building your grow room and I've done an episode about planning a perpetual grow
[03:41.820 --> 03:43.140]  or a perpetual harvest.
[03:43.460 --> 03:45.660]  So I think if you go back and listen to those episodes,
[03:45.660 --> 03:49.860]  they were really compound with episode one 13 and you will have a great start to
[03:49.860 --> 03:51.860]  growing your own cannabis when the time comes.
[03:52.220 --> 03:57.220]  So big shout out to J just like Veda or old man John as he signed the email or
[03:57.220 --> 03:58.540]  the message. A shout out.
[03:58.540 --> 04:01.420]  Thanks for the five star review and thanks for the review.
[04:01.780 --> 04:05.340]  So the next one comes from my buddy Rasta Ralph seven one nine.
[04:05.340 --> 04:06.460]  What's up dreadlock brother.
[04:06.580 --> 04:08.260]  Thanks for leaving a comment on iTunes.
[04:08.260 --> 04:10.780]  He gives me a five star rating and he says mad props.
[04:11.020 --> 04:14.020]  The comment says, thanks for all you do brother. Hey Ralph,
[04:14.020 --> 04:17.020]  thanks for growing out my seeds. Thanks for being a bad ass dude.
[04:17.140 --> 04:20.540]  Thanks for being a Rasta and most of all, thanks for the support on the podcast.
[04:20.540 --> 04:22.700]  I truly appreciate it. Thanks for the five star comment.
[04:23.500 --> 04:26.500]  Oh, we've got one more comment and it says top shelf homie.
[04:26.500 --> 04:29.020]  And this person gave us another five star review. Actually this,
[04:29.180 --> 04:32.900]  the review came today. Uh, the comment goes like this. I'm going to be honest.
[04:32.900 --> 04:35.900]  This is the first podcast I've ever listened to and I'm hooked.
[04:35.900 --> 04:38.780]  I've listened to 21 episodes in two days. Holy shit.
[04:39.100 --> 04:41.220]  That's like you never turned off the show. That's pretty rad.
[04:41.460 --> 04:43.940]  I bet my voice is embedded in your head by now. Uh,
[04:43.940 --> 04:47.260]  21 episodes in two days stoked on all the new info I've learned.
[04:47.260 --> 04:51.260]  All great info and good vibes. The homie Spencer turned me onto your podcast.
[04:51.260 --> 04:55.340]  He always gives me good info and glad to have found another source of great info.
[04:55.340 --> 04:58.460]  Love learning new things about this incredible plant slash medicine.
[04:58.700 --> 04:59.740]  Keep up the great work.
[04:59.740 --> 05:03.100]  Look forward to listening to all of them and all the new stuff you put up.
[05:03.100 --> 05:06.340]  One love homie. Well, big shout out to weed.
[05:06.340 --> 05:10.420]  Be buzzed. We'd be buds. We'd be buds. Yeah, that's how you said it.
[05:10.420 --> 05:13.180]  We'd be buds. A big, huge shout out for the comment.
[05:13.180 --> 05:16.420]  Big huge shout out for the five star rating. Thank you for listening. Also,
[05:16.420 --> 05:20.500]  huge shout out to Spencer for introducing people to the podcast. Thank you, bro.
[05:20.540 --> 05:24.380]  I appreciate it. A big shout out to my ninja Spence. All right, you guys,
[05:24.380 --> 05:27.140]  that is all of the new iTunes comments.
[05:27.140 --> 05:28.980]  I'd like to thank everybody that left a comment,
[05:28.980 --> 05:31.660]  the old comments and the new comments. I definitely appreciate it.
[05:31.660 --> 05:35.220]  We've got quite a few comments up here. We've got 31 five star reviews.
[05:35.460 --> 05:38.780]  We do not have any reviews that did not get five stars.
[05:38.940 --> 05:42.300]  So it'd be cool if you go to iTunes, throw up a five star rating,
[05:42.460 --> 05:43.180]  give me a little comment.
[05:43.180 --> 05:45.980]  Let me know what you think about the show and I will read your comment on a
[05:45.980 --> 05:46.780]  future episode.
[05:46.780 --> 05:50.300]  And what that will do is help me move up in the iTunes ranking and more people
[05:50.300 --> 05:54.100]  will see the show or people will start listening to the show or people will grow
[05:54.100 --> 05:57.380]  better cannabis. More people will support the legalization movement.
[05:57.660 --> 06:00.660]  It will just help out cannabis altogether. So please do that.
[06:00.700 --> 06:04.660]  I would appreciate it. Thanks again, everybody that sent a comment. All right.
[06:05.220 --> 06:08.460]  I've got a bunch of emails now that I would like to quickly read so that we can
[06:08.460 --> 06:10.460]  move on into some grow lessons.
[06:11.340 --> 06:14.620]  Let me get these comments up on there. These emails up on the screen.
[06:15.660 --> 06:19.580]  Sometimes I'm not sure if you guys want me to say your actual names or email
[06:19.580 --> 06:22.820]  addresses or whatever. So I'm going to try to remember to not do that.
[06:22.820 --> 06:25.500]  Sometimes I take too many dads and I blurt out people's names and shit,
[06:25.500 --> 06:27.940]  but we're going to do our best to not do that.
[06:28.940 --> 06:31.980]  This first email was sent to me with the subject, love the podcast.
[06:31.980 --> 06:33.100]  And it goes like this.
[06:33.420 --> 06:37.820]  I was looking for a cool podcast that nerds out on growing and the GWYH podcast.
[06:37.820 --> 06:41.660]  That's the G F Y H. You're close. Grow with your heart is what I think you meant.
[06:42.100 --> 06:46.460]  GFYH podcast is perfect. I listened to a bunch of podcasts and yours is the best.
[06:46.700 --> 06:48.820]  I've been an underground grower for the last decade,
[06:49.020 --> 06:52.740]  but just got my med license up here in the Northwest about two years ago.
[06:53.140 --> 06:55.540]  And this whole legal cannabis world blows my mind.
[06:55.820 --> 06:57.220]  I've gone to some growers conferences,
[06:57.220 --> 06:59.420]  but I don't know if I'll ever be able to adapt to it.
[06:59.660 --> 07:02.460]  I really appreciate the 411 from Jeff. It's amazing.
[07:02.700 --> 07:06.180]  I'm completely self-taught hydro grower who learned from trial and error,
[07:06.340 --> 07:09.660]  but the masterclass and the way Jeff lays out info is magnificent.
[07:10.060 --> 07:13.020]  I've learned so much just from the few episodes I've had time to catch.
[07:13.220 --> 07:16.980]  I really hope you guys keep it up as it's a tremendous service to the other
[07:16.980 --> 07:18.660]  growers out there.
[07:19.660 --> 07:23.740]  That kind of email is what makes all of my effort to do this show worth my time
[07:23.740 --> 07:24.580]  and energy. You guys,
[07:25.420 --> 07:28.340]  it feels good to hear people say that I'm laying out the information in a way
[07:28.340 --> 07:30.460]  that you can understand it because that was my mission.
[07:30.780 --> 07:35.060]  A lot of what prompted me to do this podcast was reading things on the internet
[07:35.060 --> 07:37.980]  and forums where people were trusting grow advice and people were giving
[07:38.180 --> 07:40.860]  terrible, shitty, false advice.
[07:41.300 --> 07:44.500]  They were going to cause more problems or they were giving advice that were
[07:44.500 --> 07:48.100]  simply based on product use like, Oh, you've got spider mines,
[07:48.100 --> 07:49.140]  buy this product.
[07:49.460 --> 07:51.780]  But then all you're going to be doing is buying that product for the rest of
[07:51.780 --> 07:53.940]  your grow career. You're never going to eliminate the mites.
[07:53.940 --> 07:55.940]  You're just going to be chasing them down with the product.
[07:56.500 --> 07:59.380]  I thought it'd be wiser to come on here and teach you how to get rid of those
[07:59.380 --> 08:02.820]  damn mites, how to fix your room, understand where the mites are coming from.
[08:03.020 --> 08:07.180]  So I do appreciate that you understand and appreciate the way I'm laying things
[08:07.180 --> 08:11.380]  out. One thing you said was that my podcast is the best. Um,
[08:11.420 --> 08:13.940]  I appreciate that, but I, I'm not in competition with anybody.
[08:13.940 --> 08:15.100]  I know the other shows out there.
[08:15.540 --> 08:18.300]  Sometimes I listen to some of them because I like to hear what's going on and I
[08:18.300 --> 08:19.260]  like to gain the other info,
[08:19.260 --> 08:21.380]  but I'm really not in any competition with anybody else.
[08:21.380 --> 08:23.980]  But I do appreciate hearing that you think I'm the best.
[08:23.980 --> 08:26.980]  If there were a podcast award or something and you chose to give it to me,
[08:27.300 --> 08:29.100]  I definitely would not decline that shit.
[08:29.100 --> 08:33.260]  So thanks for that huge compliment and thank you for the email. All right,
[08:33.260 --> 08:36.740]  I'm going to pull up another email. This one says, good morning, Ross to Jeff.
[08:36.980 --> 08:39.860]  I just sent a big thanks your way on Twitter. Thank you for the podcast.
[08:39.860 --> 08:42.420]  I'm taking notes to set up my first professional room.
[08:42.460 --> 08:45.780]  You talked to me into organics. I have a specific question for you.
[08:46.180 --> 08:51.180]  And an 11 by 11 room, how much area should I have for bedroom and a flower room?
[08:51.340 --> 08:55.380]  I was thinking six by 11 flower and a four by five bedroom.
[08:55.380 --> 08:58.620]  And then he shows a little picture here, how he divided the room. Um,
[08:58.700 --> 09:01.740]  I like what you've done. He's got an 11 by 11 flower.
[09:01.740 --> 09:05.660]  He's got himself a four by five veg and a seven by five work area.
[09:06.100 --> 09:08.060]  The only thing I don't really, uh,
[09:08.100 --> 09:10.980]  I'm not super stoked about is that seven by five work area.
[09:11.020 --> 09:13.100]  I know that's not a lot of space to do work,
[09:13.380 --> 09:17.100]  but what actually are you going to be doing in there that you need to take room
[09:17.100 --> 09:21.340]  from your gross space to dedicate to the work? Uh, I would almost,
[09:21.860 --> 09:24.580]  I would add another foot onto that veg area.
[09:24.580 --> 09:28.900]  I do a five by five veg area and keep that six by 11 flower just like it is.
[09:29.460 --> 09:31.260]  Uh, the six by 11 flower is nice and tight.
[09:31.260 --> 09:32.500]  You're not going to lose too much light.
[09:32.540 --> 09:37.060]  I would recommend hanging to 1000 watt lights in your six by 11 and maybe 1000
[09:37.060 --> 09:40.500]  watt in your, uh, five by five veg is what I would recommend.
[09:40.980 --> 09:42.580]  I'm not sure that that's what you're going to do,
[09:42.820 --> 09:45.780]  but if you listen to my perpetual grow episode, uh,
[09:45.820 --> 09:50.260]  the one five by five and the two lights in the six by 11 will really crush it.
[09:50.300 --> 09:53.780]  You'll be able to do huge shit in there. I think it'd work out for you. Um,
[09:54.540 --> 09:56.980]  I'm not sure why you want a seven by five work area.
[09:56.980 --> 09:58.500]  You're not going to use that much space.
[09:58.780 --> 10:02.220]  Mostly what you're going to be doing is mixing nutrients. Uh, you may have,
[10:02.260 --> 10:04.140]  I don't know if you plan on working in the plants in there,
[10:04.140 --> 10:05.980]  but you can work on the plants in the flower room.
[10:05.980 --> 10:07.740]  If you need to top them, lollipop them,
[10:08.140 --> 10:11.420]  maybe you'll be transplanting or something in there, but I really wouldn't, uh,
[10:12.060 --> 10:13.100]  I don't want to call it a waste,
[10:13.100 --> 10:16.020]  but it is almost a waste of space to use it as a work area.
[10:16.020 --> 10:20.620]  As opposed to part of the gross space, you can work in gross space. If that,
[10:20.660 --> 10:24.140]  if it comes down to that, um, if you really want it to,
[10:24.140 --> 10:28.020]  you could eliminate that workspace and almost add a whole nother light with that
[10:28.020 --> 10:31.820]  space. We could totally do that. All right. That's my opinion. Uh,
[10:32.460 --> 10:36.460]  if I just read your email and I answered that and confused you more or helped you
[10:36.460 --> 10:39.340]  out, send me more details and we will narrow this down and get this room right
[10:39.340 --> 10:42.100]  for you. We'll get it perfect. It'll be sexy. Uh, anyway,
[10:42.100 --> 10:45.180]  good job planning a room. Not a lot of people actually go and write that shit
[10:45.180 --> 10:48.740]  down. So, uh, props for that. And also thanks for sending me an email.
[10:48.740 --> 10:52.740]  I look forward to your reply. Let's see, let's get into our next email.
[10:53.020 --> 10:57.540]  This one was headlined tinctures and it says, Jeff, Hey man, Floridian here.
[10:57.820 --> 11:00.380]  I've been listening to your show. His name's not Floridian by the way.
[11:00.380 --> 11:03.420]  He's from Florida is what I think that meant. Uh, he says,
[11:03.420 --> 11:05.980]  I've been listening to your show just so I can keep tabs on the industry and
[11:05.980 --> 11:08.940]  culture in Colorado. It is interesting. I'm not a smoker,
[11:08.940 --> 11:12.700]  but I respect and support the rights of those who are respect. Uh,
[11:12.740 --> 11:14.500]  there's more to this email, but I want to jump in and say,
[11:14.820 --> 11:16.500]  that's rad because at the start of the show,
[11:16.700 --> 11:19.140]  I say if you're just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[11:19.540 --> 11:21.060]  this is the show for you. Well,
[11:21.100 --> 11:24.220]  this guy right here is the guy who's only curious about the current state of
[11:24.220 --> 11:27.180]  cannabis. So we're aiming the show right at him and it hit him and he's
[11:27.180 --> 11:30.300]  listening. That's awesome. Perfect bond right there. I appreciate that.
[11:30.820 --> 11:31.980]  Uh, he goes on to say, anyway,
[11:32.180 --> 11:35.620]  I know someone who is having trouble sleeping and I heard THC tinctures work
[11:35.620 --> 11:37.420]  well for that and fast.
[11:37.420 --> 11:40.140]  Can you direct me to some information about tincture varieties,
[11:40.380 --> 11:42.380]  dosage and potency? Also,
[11:42.380 --> 11:45.060]  do you know roughly how much an average bottle costs in the Colorado
[11:45.060 --> 11:47.940]  marketplace? If you had a show that covers the topic,
[11:47.940 --> 11:48.980]  I'd love to know which one,
[11:48.980 --> 11:51.940]  or perhaps you can talk a little about this in a future episode,
[11:52.220 --> 11:56.860]  take care of yourself. And then he says word and signed his not real name.
[11:57.180 --> 11:59.620]  I think we could say your name since you called yourself J dog, right?
[12:00.420 --> 12:03.020]  So shout out the J dog for sending me an email. Um,
[12:03.060 --> 12:06.580]  I want to get my friend Fox to come on the show and talk a little bit about
[12:06.580 --> 12:11.100]  tinctures. Uh, Fox, you were invited on the podcast. Fox just moved near me.
[12:11.140 --> 12:12.540]  So you got to come be on the show, dude.
[12:12.620 --> 12:15.460]  Let's talk about tinctures and help this guy and his friends out. Uh,
[12:15.460 --> 12:18.300]  what I can tell you about tincture, you asked a couple of things here. Uh,
[12:18.340 --> 12:22.460]  can I direct you to some info such as dosage and potency? Uh,
[12:22.500 --> 12:25.300]  dosage is based on potency. And when you come to Colorado,
[12:25.300 --> 12:28.860]  you can buy a bottle of tincture that will have the exact, uh,
[12:28.860 --> 12:32.500]  potency per dose printed on the bottle. It will say, if you take a,
[12:32.500 --> 12:34.860]  it'll probably be like an ounce or a two ounce bottle.
[12:35.140 --> 12:36.780]  It'll say if you drink this whole ounce,
[12:36.780 --> 12:41.780]  you'll probably consume 250 milligrams of THC. If you are a new consumer,
[12:42.340 --> 12:46.180]  I think we recommend 25 milligrams as the starting dose. Uh,
[12:46.220 --> 12:50.340]  you want 25 milligrams of cannabinoids of THC in your body, uh,
[12:50.380 --> 12:54.500]  to start with eat that way to, if it's tincture, you just basically drink it, uh,
[12:54.540 --> 12:57.340]  put it in a medicine dropper, put it into some coffee, put it into some juice.
[12:57.340 --> 13:00.420]  I just pour it right down the throat. I just drink it. It tastes pretty good.
[13:00.420 --> 13:05.380]  It's got like a warm honey kind of flavor. Uh, take 25 milligrams, uh,
[13:05.500 --> 13:09.340]  take enough tincture that will contain 25 milligrams and wait about 45 minutes.
[13:09.380 --> 13:13.500]  See if you see any effect. If you don't take another 25 milligram dose,
[13:13.980 --> 13:15.580]  you can always take more tincture,
[13:15.620 --> 13:18.060]  but you can't undo how much tincture you've taken.
[13:18.060 --> 13:22.620]  And a tincture high comes on quickly. And when it is appropriately dosed,
[13:22.660 --> 13:25.180]  it can be strong. It will hit you and you will feel it.
[13:25.620 --> 13:31.060]  So dosage is based on potency. Uh, I would say take 25 milligrams at a time
[13:31.380 --> 13:34.100]  and work your way up. Um, it's going to be,
[13:34.100 --> 13:35.940]  unless you come to Colorado or a medical state,
[13:35.940 --> 13:40.380]  it'll be hard to judge the potency of your tincture, honestly. So, um,
[13:40.460 --> 13:43.780]  that's dosage. We were talking, you asked about sativas and indicas.
[13:43.820 --> 13:46.900]  Indicas would definitely be better for the sleep. In my opinion,
[13:46.900 --> 13:49.740]  if you're trying to put your body to relax mode, you want some indica,
[13:49.740 --> 13:53.980]  you may want some CBD in there. CBD may help your body relax. Uh,
[13:54.020 --> 13:56.460]  it'll just make you chill out a little bit. That may help you sleep.
[13:56.940 --> 14:00.660]  So I would recommend a heavy indica or something with some CBD in it. Uh,
[14:00.700 --> 14:03.220]  that'll definitely help with the sleep. And then you say, also,
[14:03.420 --> 14:06.620]  do you know roughly how much an average bottle costs in Colorado?
[14:07.180 --> 14:09.220]  The price is going to vary from shop to shop,
[14:09.220 --> 14:12.820]  and it will certainly vary between medical and recreational facilities.
[14:13.100 --> 14:17.060]  In a medical facility. Uh, I think the average price of an edible,
[14:17.100 --> 14:21.780]  which includes tinctures is going to be around 10 to $15 per hundred
[14:21.820 --> 14:25.780]  milligrams of cannabinoids. So if there's a hundred milligrams of THC in there,
[14:25.780 --> 14:29.140]  it's probably going to cost you 10 to $15. If there's 200,
[14:29.140 --> 14:33.900]  expect to spend 20 to 25, maybe 30. If you're getting up in the 300 milligrams,
[14:34.100 --> 14:36.060]  look to spend 30 to 45 bucks.
[14:36.380 --> 14:38.500]  That's kind of the scale that I've seen it working on.
[14:38.500 --> 14:42.500]  That is not hard and fast at all. Trust me, that is not solid anywhere,
[14:42.500 --> 14:45.780]  but that's what I've seen. It's about 10 bucks for a hundred milligrams. Uh,
[14:45.820 --> 14:47.860]  if you go to a recreational marketplace,
[14:47.900 --> 14:51.060]  it'll probably be one and a half times that much.
[14:51.260 --> 14:54.740]  So you're looking at 15 to 20 bucks for your a hundred milligrams. Uh,
[14:54.740 --> 14:58.900]  you're looking at like somewhere between 30 to 50 bucks for a 200 milligram
[14:58.900 --> 15:00.900]  edible and some of the recreational facilities,
[15:01.100 --> 15:04.380]  but they do have a huge markup because they know people are coming from all over
[15:04.380 --> 15:05.740]  the country, all over the world,
[15:05.740 --> 15:09.100]  and they will pay the price just to have the experience and have the access.
[15:09.420 --> 15:11.900]  So that's how much you should expect to pay. Um,
[15:11.900 --> 15:14.620]  I will get our friend Kabuki J Fox on here. What up Kabuki?
[15:14.620 --> 15:15.500]  I need you on the show, bro.
[15:15.500 --> 15:18.540]  Let's do an episode a little bit more about tinctures.
[15:18.820 --> 15:20.420]  I think the tinctures will hit you quickly.
[15:20.620 --> 15:23.460]  I think that will work to help your friend get some sleep. Um,
[15:23.500 --> 15:24.900]  you got to come to Colorado and get it.
[15:25.140 --> 15:30.180]  One thing I can recommend is a full CBD. CBD is legal nationwide.
[15:30.180 --> 15:34.940]  If you can find CBD that was derived from cannabis or hemp and is all
[15:34.940 --> 15:38.700]  organic, natural CBD, you can consume, possess,
[15:39.020 --> 15:42.180]  you can have CBD products. If as long as they don't have THC in them,
[15:42.180 --> 15:43.940]  you can have CBD products in Florida.
[15:44.260 --> 15:48.820]  There are companies that will send a CBD to you in Florida. Uh, try that.
[15:48.820 --> 15:51.980]  Be careful. Don't get anything from China. Make sure it's made in America.
[15:51.980 --> 15:56.380]  Try to find a reputable source. Uh, try that out. Maybe that will work for you.
[15:56.420 --> 15:58.860]  That's my advice. I want to say thanks for that email.
[15:58.940 --> 16:01.860]  Thanks for supporting the show. J dog. I hope I gave you some good info.
[16:02.020 --> 16:05.300]  If you have more questions, please feel free to email them to me.
[16:05.700 --> 16:08.380]  I would love to help your friend get some good rest.
[16:08.500 --> 16:10.500]  And also thanks for trying to get some info for your friend.
[16:10.500 --> 16:13.420]  That's a good friend. Big shout out fist bump, much respect. All right.
[16:13.740 --> 16:15.500]  Our next email comes from, oh, that's right.
[16:15.500 --> 16:19.260]  I'm not going to say this guy's name. Our next email is a headlined or subject.
[16:19.260 --> 16:21.860]  Did a aquaponic grower. And he says, hi there.
[16:21.860 --> 16:25.100]  I recently found your podcast after someone recommended it to me and I really
[16:25.100 --> 16:25.940]  enjoy the show.
[16:26.140 --> 16:29.500]  I've been working on perfecting cannabis growing and aquaponics for the past few
[16:29.520 --> 16:33.140]  years and was curious if you've ever had anyone on the show to talk about the
[16:33.140 --> 16:34.220]  aquaponic growing.
[16:34.620 --> 16:38.020]  If you are ever looking for someone to talk about the differences about growing
[16:38.020 --> 16:39.500]  and aquaponics, I would love to,
[16:39.740 --> 16:43.180]  thanks for taking the time to read my email and I look forward to hearing back
[16:43.180 --> 16:46.540]  from you. All right, well, let me get right to it. I, uh,
[16:46.620 --> 16:49.020]  am not very experienced in aquaponic growing,
[16:49.060 --> 16:52.260]  but I would love to hear what you've got to say. Uh,
[16:52.260 --> 16:55.540]  if you want to be on the show, we can set up maybe a FaceTime interview.
[16:55.700 --> 16:57.460]  Maybe we could do it through Skype or something.
[16:57.460 --> 16:58.820]  FaceTime would be the easiest for me.
[16:59.060 --> 17:02.500]  So if you're listening to this episode and you sent me the email about aquaponics
[17:02.500 --> 17:04.980]  growing, please contact me, send me another email.
[17:04.980 --> 17:06.980]  We will set up a way to get you on this podcast.
[17:06.980 --> 17:09.540]  If you've got an iPhone or a Mac book, we're golden.
[17:09.580 --> 17:12.260]  All we've got to do is make a quick phone call. We can record.
[17:12.660 --> 17:13.900]  I'd love to get you on the show.
[17:14.140 --> 17:16.860]  I'm sure a lot of people would love to know about aquaponics growing.
[17:17.140 --> 17:19.140]  I'm sorry I don't have any more information for you on it,
[17:19.820 --> 17:22.060]  but by the looks of it, uh, you've got it all figured out.
[17:22.060 --> 17:23.260]  So I'd love to get you on the show.
[17:23.580 --> 17:27.020]  One thing I want to mention is this guy's email said that, uh,
[17:27.020 --> 17:30.260]  he learned about the show after someone recommended it to him. You guys,
[17:30.540 --> 17:34.500]  what I would like for you to do is recommend my podcast to three of your
[17:34.520 --> 17:35.340]  friends. That's right.
[17:35.340 --> 17:37.660]  Three of them because only one of them is going to actually end up becoming a
[17:37.680 --> 17:40.980]  subscriber and a long time listener, but tell three people, uh,
[17:41.340 --> 17:43.660]  maybe you'll tell somebody that smokes cannabis every day.
[17:43.680 --> 17:45.780]  Maybe you'll tell somebody that grows cannabis every day,
[17:46.060 --> 17:48.900]  or maybe you'll tell people that are afraid of cannabis and need to learn the
[17:48.900 --> 17:52.300]  truth about cannabis and realize that there's a guy out here that smokes more
[17:52.300 --> 17:55.140]  hash than most people could even imagine every single day.
[17:55.340 --> 17:58.380]  And I'm able to put together a podcast. I've got a solid career.
[17:58.500 --> 18:01.940]  I own multiple companies. I've got my shit together. Maybe this, uh,
[18:01.960 --> 18:03.380]  podcast can, uh,
[18:03.400 --> 18:07.460]  free up some myths and get people out of the dark ages when it comes to cannabis
[18:07.480 --> 18:10.380]  mindset. All right. So introduce three people to my show.
[18:10.380 --> 18:11.260]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[18:11.460 --> 18:15.060]  And I want to thank my friend with his aquaponic email. That's a great email.
[18:15.080 --> 18:18.700]  I hope we can get you on the show. All right. I've got another email.
[18:18.720 --> 18:21.020]  This one is kind of long, but it goes like this.
[18:21.040 --> 18:24.100]  Thank you very much for taking the time out once again and answering my emails.
[18:24.140 --> 18:27.220]  Oh, this is from a guy that I replied to before and his name.
[18:27.340 --> 18:30.020]  We've said his name on the show before. This is from the tri County bandit.
[18:30.340 --> 18:31.820]  He says, thank you for, uh,
[18:31.820 --> 18:34.780]  very much for taking time out once again and answering my emails. Real talk.
[18:34.780 --> 18:36.900]  You're a real person, dude. And I appreciate you.
[18:37.140 --> 18:39.420]  Thank you for taking up most of the show for me. Well,
[18:39.420 --> 18:41.780]  I guess it's partly my fault for the long winded email.
[18:41.900 --> 18:45.060]  Let me try and be brief as you were explaining to me on the podcast about
[18:45.060 --> 18:47.940]  phenotypical expressions and my environment. It dawned on me.
[18:48.180 --> 18:51.420]  I've been growing out different strains now and they all seem to be very hairy.
[18:51.820 --> 18:55.220]  I've been wondering what the fuck has been going on. I know pistols are good,
[18:55.240 --> 18:58.900]  but it seems like it a whole lot. I'd like to see my trikes, which are there,
[18:58.900 --> 19:02.220]  but seems like I have to trim the hairs back to see the actual bud mass.
[19:02.500 --> 19:06.420]  Could this be a sign of bad environment or lacking something there in shits
[19:06.420 --> 19:07.820]  dank though, Jeff. So I ain't mad,
[19:07.820 --> 19:09.980]  but the bottom of my jars are just loaded with hairs.
[19:10.460 --> 19:13.380]  Can my trimming be really shitty? Do you get this problem?
[19:13.400 --> 19:15.060]  Or have you ever known anyone who has?
[19:15.060 --> 19:19.340]  And I think maybe it has to deal with the humidity maybe as Florida gets 95%
[19:19.660 --> 19:21.740]  most of the year, but I could be wrong.
[19:22.140 --> 19:25.300]  I'd love to hear that future podcast on selecting a male for breeding.
[19:25.320 --> 19:27.540]  We just did that one bro. It's out. So I hope you heard that. Uh,
[19:27.540 --> 19:31.260]  I start my garden from regular seeds. So naturally some of my,
[19:31.280 --> 19:33.580]  some males sprout and would love to try to,
[19:33.620 --> 19:36.900]  I would love to recreate more seeds for myself. Also,
[19:36.900 --> 19:39.940]  thanks again for giving a shit, man. I appreciate your input on my eating.
[19:40.180 --> 19:42.700]  I'm not vegan or shit, man, but I'm not even a vegetarian,
[19:42.720 --> 19:44.260]  but I've trying to change my habits.
[19:44.260 --> 19:47.260]  And I've noticed that on the weeks where I have salads and water,
[19:47.280 --> 19:51.260]  I feel the best would love to hear about some good recipes. If you got some bro.
[19:51.280 --> 19:53.980]  And Hey, I hear it. If you're not the Susie homemaker types,
[19:53.980 --> 19:55.460]  you're not trying to give me recipes,
[19:55.460 --> 19:57.940]  but let me know what's on Ross and Jeff's weekly menu.
[19:58.340 --> 20:02.060]  Never really met any vegans. I only heard about them on the radio and TV.
[20:02.620 --> 20:06.300]  I can't imagine what you would do without meat or eggs.
[20:06.340 --> 20:07.660]  You don't eat eggs either. Right? Damn.
[20:07.660 --> 20:11.020]  My bad Jeff got really baked and listened to the show like twice stoned again.
[20:11.020 --> 20:14.260]  And wrote this email. Sorry for the ramble so much for keeping it brief.
[20:14.260 --> 20:17.140]  This does not have to be on the show. It can be if you'd like much love,
[20:17.140 --> 20:21.060]  try County bandit. Guess what, bro? Your whole damn email made it to the show.
[20:21.580 --> 20:26.340]  Let me back up and I will answer some of your questions. Um,
[20:26.620 --> 20:29.600]  yes, your buds are airy because it's too hot. Probably.
[20:29.600 --> 20:32.380]  I think your buds are getting airy and fluffy because it's too hot and too
[20:32.380 --> 20:35.860]  humid in your grow space. Uh, you need to give it some more cool air.
[20:36.460 --> 20:40.420]  Possibly back the lights up from the plants a little bit and, uh,
[20:40.620 --> 20:43.140]  lower the humidity. I'm not sure if you're growing indoors or outdoors,
[20:43.420 --> 20:47.740]  but you need lower humidity and probably some more fans. Cool those plants off.
[20:48.180 --> 20:51.900]  So, uh, think about in the summer when it gets real hot, uh,
[20:51.900 --> 20:54.740]  your plants are puffing out because they're trying to get off of each other so
[20:54.760 --> 20:56.580]  that they aren't like, you don't, all right,
[20:56.580 --> 20:57.980]  this is the only way I can describe it, dude.
[20:58.140 --> 21:00.300]  In the summertime your balls hang real low cause it's hot.
[21:00.340 --> 21:03.140]  Your balls don't want to be up by your body cause it's all hot and sweaty
[21:03.140 --> 21:05.260]  there. So they try to creep away from your body a little bit.
[21:05.580 --> 21:06.820]  Your plants are doing the same thing.
[21:06.820 --> 21:09.180]  The calyxes are trying to get away from each other cause it's too hot.
[21:09.180 --> 21:12.460]  They're getting sweaty on each other. So give them some cool space,
[21:12.660 --> 21:15.700]  cool it down and then they'll get nice and tight. They'll get a little smaller.
[21:15.780 --> 21:17.580]  You notice what happens to your nut sack when it's all cold.
[21:17.580 --> 21:19.260]  It just goes boom and you get a little coin purse.
[21:19.500 --> 21:20.940]  Same things happen into your plants, bro.
[21:21.020 --> 21:22.780]  I cannot believe I just said that on the podcast,
[21:22.780 --> 21:26.220]  but it's the only way I've got to describe this. All right. So the next part,
[21:26.220 --> 21:30.500]  you talk about, um, eating naturally. I'm not a vegan. Let me clear that one up.
[21:30.780 --> 21:34.620]  I am not vegan one day per week. I do eat a vegan diet.
[21:34.660 --> 21:35.540]  One day per week.
[21:35.540 --> 21:38.740]  I do not include any animals in my eating one day out of the week.
[21:39.060 --> 21:42.060]  That day out of the week could be any random day. I don't do it every Thursday.
[21:42.060 --> 21:45.580]  I don't do it every Tuesday. I just make a concert conscious effort to one day,
[21:45.580 --> 21:49.820]  weekly, not eat any animal products. Um, I am always a vegetarian.
[21:50.060 --> 21:52.900]  I do not consume any flesh of any animal. I don't eat fish.
[21:52.900 --> 21:56.140]  I don't eat chicken. I don't eat meat of any kind at all. Uh,
[21:56.140 --> 21:56.900]  I don't eat bacon.
[21:56.900 --> 22:00.060]  I won't eat your pizza if it had a pepperoni on it and you peeled the pepperoni
[22:00.060 --> 22:03.220]  off. I still don't want that shit. That's how I roll. Not a vegan,
[22:03.220 --> 22:05.380]  just a strict vegetarian. Um,
[22:05.420 --> 22:09.340]  so you asked about some recipes and stuff. Honestly, bro,
[22:09.340 --> 22:11.740]  I am a terrible vegetarian. I eat a shit ton of pizza.
[22:11.780 --> 22:16.500]  I ate a bunch of pasta and I eat a bunch of salads. Um, I'm a bachelor.
[22:16.540 --> 22:21.460]  I eat on the go most of the time. So a lot of my diet consists of Thai food.
[22:21.900 --> 22:25.580]  Uh, I love a lot of pad Thai. Uh, I love a lot of rice meals.
[22:25.860 --> 22:28.940]  I ate a lot of eggplant. I ate a lot of bananas. Uh,
[22:29.060 --> 22:32.860]  almost every meal I eat has an avocado involved in some way, shape or form.
[22:33.100 --> 22:35.820]  Uh, I drink a lot of kombucha teas. I like probiotics.
[22:35.820 --> 22:37.980]  I drink a lot of coconut water. Uh,
[22:37.980 --> 22:41.700]  that's the kind of stuff that I eat. Lots of fruits and vegetables. Um,
[22:41.740 --> 22:43.620]  I've been trying to replace all of my snacks.
[22:43.620 --> 22:46.340]  If I want a sugary snack or a granola bar or some shit like that,
[22:46.660 --> 22:50.420]  I try to replace it with maybe a small handful of peanuts and some fruit
[22:50.460 --> 22:53.540]  because sometimes I want some crunch and I used to just reach for a candy bar or
[22:53.540 --> 22:55.060]  a bag of chips or some, some crap.
[22:55.060 --> 22:58.900]  But now I just eat like some pistachios or some almonds and then some fruit to
[22:58.900 --> 23:02.740]  go with that to give it some sweetness and some flavor and get that crunch. Uh,
[23:02.740 --> 23:05.820]  that's the kind of stuff that I like to snack on. A lot of pasta,
[23:05.900 --> 23:10.020]  lots of fruits and vegetables, lots of salads, lots of stuff like that. Um, yeah,
[23:10.020 --> 23:13.220]  definitely not the Susie homemaker type, dude. I am not the, uh,
[23:13.260 --> 23:17.020]  the super chef vegetarian guy. Uh, you said something about eggs.
[23:17.340 --> 23:20.340]  I won't fry up eggs and eat them. I won't have an omelet,
[23:20.380 --> 23:22.940]  but I will eat something that's got eggs in it,
[23:22.940 --> 23:26.220]  like a cake or something like that. If I do eat, you know what I mean?
[23:26.260 --> 23:29.540]  Like I would eat something like that, but I'm not just going to go fry up some
[23:29.540 --> 23:34.220]  eggs. So I replied to your rambly ass message with a bunch of rambles myself.
[23:34.940 --> 23:38.260]  I hope I made some sense for you. I do appreciate you sending me messages and,
[23:38.260 --> 23:42.100]  uh, please send me some more messages. I would appreciate it. All right.
[23:42.100 --> 23:43.940]  I want to thank everybody for the emails that they sent.
[23:44.140 --> 23:47.940]  I really appreciate the interaction from all of my friends and listeners. Uh,
[23:47.940 --> 23:51.380]  if you want to send me an email, it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[23:51.580 --> 23:53.020]  I would love to hear what you have to say.

[24:06.640 --> 24:09.740]  I use my seed company name, Irie genetics on Instagram. Check us out.
[24:09.980 --> 24:13.860]  I post a bunch of great cannabis photography. All right, you guys,
[24:13.860 --> 24:16.220]  that's all the emails and comments I've got for you for tonight.
[24:16.420 --> 24:18.740]  I need to take a quick dab. I need to take a drink.
[24:18.780 --> 24:22.180]  And then we're going to come back with a couple of really simple grow tips that
[24:22.180 --> 24:24.340]  will really help out your garden. Hang on for just one second.
[24:24.380 --> 24:25.340]  And I will be right back.
[24:26.860 --> 24:31.300]  Yeah. All right. I am back and I'm officially dabbed the fuck out. Once again,
[24:31.380 --> 24:33.780]  big shout out to my friends at Terpex. All right.
[24:33.780 --> 24:37.620]  So I said I was going to come back and give you guys some grow tips. Uh,
[24:37.620 --> 24:40.740]  the other day I was talking to a friend and he was telling me about his garden
[24:40.740 --> 24:44.740]  and he said he was running three or four different strains and he was running his
[24:44.740 --> 24:48.220]  lights 24 hours a day. So the plants are in a vegetative stage.
[24:48.580 --> 24:52.940]  And he said that one strain in the room is trying to start flowering while they
[24:53.060 --> 24:54.380]  are in veg. And he said,
[24:54.380 --> 24:57.380]  he's ran this cut a couple of times and it's done it both times.
[24:57.900 --> 24:59.380]  So he was freaking out,
[24:59.380 --> 25:02.700]  very curious why his plants are auto flowering when they're not auto flower
[25:02.700 --> 25:06.980]  plants. Um, there are a couple of things that can make this happen. In my opinion,
[25:06.980 --> 25:10.260]  from what this guy says, I feel like his plants are root bound.
[25:10.660 --> 25:11.860]  When your plants get root bound,
[25:11.860 --> 25:14.420]  that means that the roots have filled up the entire soil area.
[25:14.440 --> 25:16.900]  There's no more space in the container for roots to grow.
[25:17.260 --> 25:20.500]  Now the plant is growing. The roots are pressing up against themselves.
[25:20.780 --> 25:23.140]  And that plant knows my container is full.
[25:23.160 --> 25:26.460]  There's nowhere for me to stretch out my legs. I've got to do something.
[25:27.100 --> 25:30.580]  The only real thing that a cannabis plant can do at that point is flower.
[25:30.860 --> 25:35.300]  It wants to create buds. It wants to make calyxes or pistils or pollen so that it
[25:35.300 --> 25:37.660]  can breed and continue on the species.
[25:37.980 --> 25:40.780]  So that plant goes into flower mode to protect itself.
[25:40.800 --> 25:44.340]  That's basically the plant's job. It says, Oh shit, I could die.
[25:44.380 --> 25:47.660]  I better start flowering. So that's what I think is happening.
[25:47.660 --> 25:49.380]  I think his plants are getting root bound.
[25:49.740 --> 25:53.460]  Root bound plants will show signs of auto flower.
[25:53.460 --> 25:56.180]  And if you don't up pot them or fix the problem,
[25:56.220 --> 26:00.900]  they will go into full flower on you and you won't be able to stop it. All right.
[26:01.220 --> 26:04.900]  Another thing that I think may be causing these plants to go root bound or
[26:04.920 --> 26:07.820]  plants could go root bound from this is a lack of light.
[26:08.380 --> 26:11.780]  A lot of times I noticed that if a plant is not getting enough light at the very
[26:11.780 --> 26:14.820]  bottom area, that's where it will start to auto flower.
[26:14.820 --> 26:19.220]  Your very bottom branches will start showing calyx pistils popping up early or
[26:19.540 --> 26:22.140]  it's too early. They're popping up early. They shouldn't be there yet.
[26:22.620 --> 26:26.340]  As probably because the lower part of that plant is not getting enough light.
[26:26.660 --> 26:30.980]  All of the leaves up top or the plants next door are blocking out the light and
[26:30.980 --> 26:34.540]  that plant is going to auto flower because it's not getting light and it's
[26:34.540 --> 26:36.220]  trying to protect itself. Once again,
[26:36.780 --> 26:40.460]  this type of thing is way more common if you're using like T5s or T8s or
[26:40.460 --> 26:43.580]  fluorescents or maybe LEDs. If you're using Govitas,
[26:43.620 --> 26:47.820]  you won't see as much auto flower from lack of light as you do with the smaller
[26:48.340 --> 26:50.260]  compact fluorescents and stuff like that.
[26:50.460 --> 26:55.460]  So a lot of the problem could be lack of light or another thing that is very
[26:55.500 --> 27:00.260]  possible is not a proper light cycle. Plants flower based on photo period.
[27:00.260 --> 27:03.300]  Every plant has got what it's called a critical photo period.
[27:04.020 --> 27:07.580]  Some plants will actually begin to flower under 14 hours of daylight.
[27:07.580 --> 27:09.060]  You don't have to reduce it to 12.
[27:09.260 --> 27:12.620]  That's why outdoors you see some plants starting to flower before our natural
[27:12.620 --> 27:13.940]  cycle gets to 12, 12.
[27:14.260 --> 27:18.700]  So there is a critical period on your plants and some plants will flower early.
[27:18.940 --> 27:20.340]  Also, if you stress plants,
[27:20.500 --> 27:23.380]  they will start to flower on you because they know that they're going to die.
[27:23.620 --> 27:26.980]  So the main three causes of an auto flowering plant that is not meant to auto
[27:26.980 --> 27:28.420]  flower are root bound,
[27:28.700 --> 27:33.100]  not enough light and maybe not a correct photo period for that particular
[27:33.100 --> 27:33.940]  cultivar.
[27:34.100 --> 27:36.900]  So the first thing I would always check is to make sure your plant's not root
[27:36.900 --> 27:39.700]  bound. If it is, all you've got to do is put it into a bigger pot.
[27:39.860 --> 27:41.220]  It's really not that much of a challenge.
[27:41.460 --> 27:42.700]  If you're starting to flower,
[27:42.860 --> 27:46.300]  I usually try not to transplant plants during the flowering phase because that
[27:46.300 --> 27:49.700]  can really shock them. But if you're severely root bound, go for it.
[27:49.700 --> 27:51.500]  Just do it because your plant will appreciate it.
[27:51.500 --> 27:53.460]  It's going to spend some energy stretching out its roots,
[27:53.660 --> 27:55.540]  but it'll be worth it. You'll get a bigger plant.
[27:55.540 --> 27:57.580]  You'll get a better quality product. If you do it correctly,
[27:57.940 --> 28:00.140]  just be extra careful not to stress out your plant,
[28:00.140 --> 28:03.340]  disrupt those exposed roots too much when you're doing the up pot. All right.
[28:03.340 --> 28:05.140]  So that's enough for that question.
[28:05.460 --> 28:08.980]  The other question that a friend brought to me was why are these plants not
[28:08.980 --> 28:11.900]  finishing? He's like, these plants have been in this garden for 14 weeks.
[28:11.900 --> 28:14.940]  They're still airy. They're still fluffy. The calyxes are not done.
[28:15.060 --> 28:19.220]  The trichomes are not amber. Uh, the pistils have not gotten orange yet.
[28:19.260 --> 28:21.980]  Everything is still going. I've got more time to go. What is happening?
[28:22.500 --> 28:25.460]  So this kind of goes back to earlier when I was talking about the critical
[28:25.460 --> 28:26.260]  period.
[28:26.260 --> 28:29.740]  Plants that flower for a long time are usually from a more tropical climate,
[28:29.740 --> 28:32.380]  somewhere near the equator. So they get longer days.
[28:32.660 --> 28:37.100]  So these plants are expecting the season to only change by about an hour or two.
[28:37.540 --> 28:41.660]  So what I would recommend to make these plants speed up their flowering process
[28:41.860 --> 28:46.540]  is around week nine or 10, start reducing the timer on your daylight cycle.
[28:46.780 --> 28:48.140]  So instead of going 12, 12,
[28:48.340 --> 28:52.060]  maybe start going to like 11 hours and 30 minutes and then, you know,
[28:52.060 --> 28:54.660]  just start working it down until finally you're down at like eight hours.
[28:54.940 --> 28:57.020]  And then those plants will really start to speed up.
[28:57.020 --> 29:00.380]  It'll make the plants get more dense. It'll make the trichome start to,
[29:00.460 --> 29:03.660]  start to turn amber. The plants will know that winter is coming.
[29:03.660 --> 29:07.140]  You just got to tell them, uh, if nothing changes in that room,
[29:07.340 --> 29:09.740]  those plants will not change because they're just used to being out by the
[29:09.740 --> 29:12.940]  equator. They're used to being in the jungle somewhere where it's sunshiny.
[29:12.940 --> 29:16.540]  They're getting all kinds of sun and they're just not ready for the time to end.
[29:16.940 --> 29:20.980]  All right, you guys, that is all of the episode I've got for you this week.
[29:20.980 --> 29:23.020]  I feel like I've been going on for a long time by myself.
[29:23.020 --> 29:25.780]  It's a 30 minute episode already. So I'm gonna start wrapping up the show.
[29:25.900 --> 29:28.940]  I hope you learned a whole bunch. I want to thank everybody for listening. Uh,

[29:41.820 --> 29:44.700]  I am going to record another episode with our good buddy, white Mike pretty soon.
[29:44.700 --> 29:48.100]  So we'll get that out to you in a few days. Uh, if you've got a product,
[29:48.180 --> 29:50.180]  you'd like me to review, or if you'd like to sponsor the show,

[29:52.580 --> 29:54.100]  I'll get you all the information that you need.
[29:54.380 --> 29:55.540]  You guys have been going on for a long time.
[29:55.540 --> 29:58.980]  I'm about to start coughing and my throat is super dry. So I'm going to wrap it up.
[29:58.980 --> 30:02.900]  Until next time, take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me.
[30:56.610 --> 30:58.610]  Oh, just being without a care.
[30:58.610 --> 31:00.610]  Oh, children from my brood, they come and bring me food.
[31:00.610 --> 31:02.610]  Maybe open up a window for air.
[31:02.610 --> 31:04.610]  Oh, just now, I smell a cornbread bake.
[31:04.610 --> 31:06.610]  Oh, now I feel a medicine take.
[31:06.610 --> 31:08.610]  Just like home.
[31:08.610 --> 31:10.610]  Oh, just like home.
[31:10.610 --> 31:12.610]  Oh, just like home.
[31:12.610 --> 31:14.610]  Oh, just like home.
[31:14.610 --> 31:16.610]  Oh, just like home.
[31:16.610 --> 31:20.260]  Oh, just like home.
[31:20.260 --> 31:22.260]  Oh, just like home.
[31:22.260 --> 31:24.260]  Oh, just like home.
[31:24.260 --> 31:32.270]  Oh, just like home.
[31:32.270 --> 31:34.270]  Oh, just like home.
[31:40.680 --> 31:42.680]  Stray dogs go
[31:42.680 --> 31:52.540]  to it all
[31:52.540 --> 31:54.540]  just here.
[31:54.540 --> 32:38.710]  Brave little friend.
[32:38.710 --> 32:40.710]  Many spirits strong
[32:40.710 --> 32:42.710]  and no preacher
[32:42.710 --> 32:44.710]  just happy to meet you.
[32:44.710 --> 32:46.710]  Clap a bow underneath the bed.
[32:46.710 --> 32:48.710]  Keep our spirits fed.
[32:48.710 --> 32:50.710]  My hat's off to you.

[32:52.710 --> 32:54.710]  and all the brave friends
[32:54.710 --> 32:58.710]  It's soccer student broom in a broom in a radio
[32:58.710 --> 33:00.710]  They're twisting out a dozy dough
[33:00.710 --> 33:02.710]  A brand new day
[33:02.710 --> 33:08.980]  Whole world's all around us going so
[33:08.980 --> 33:11.980]  Just now

[33:13.980 --> 33:16.980]  Won't hesitate
[33:16.980 --> 33:19.980]  All it takes
[33:19.980 --> 33:24.980]  Is a moment to break
[33:24.980 --> 33:27.980]  Sweet, sweet
[33:27.980 --> 33:36.620]  Your honeycomb
[33:36.620 --> 33:40.620]  Just like home
[33:40.620 --> 33:47.430]  Just like
[33:47.430 --> 34:03.610]  Just like home
[34:03.610 --> 34:11.850]  Oh, that's my home
[34:11.850 --> 34:18.500]  Rest gives stone to it all
[34:18.500 --> 34:22.500]  Still just here
[34:22.500 --> 34:26.900]  Still right here
[34:26.900 --> 34:28.900]  Still just here
