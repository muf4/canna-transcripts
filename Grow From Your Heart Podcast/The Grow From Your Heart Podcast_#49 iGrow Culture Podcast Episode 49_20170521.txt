[00:16.700 --> 00:23.700]  Yeah, what's up cannabis community? It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Welcome to episode number 49.
[00:23.700 --> 00:31.700]  Oh, I apologize in advance. I can already tell that my voice sounds all terrible because I've got a cold, but as a professional podcaster, this show must go on.
[00:31.700 --> 00:35.700]  So I'm going to skip that long intro that I do and we're just going to introduce everybody that's here.
[00:35.700 --> 00:37.700]  To my left, we got Adam. What's up, brother?
[00:37.700 --> 00:38.700]  Yo, what's up, man?
[00:38.700 --> 00:39.700]  To the left of him is White Mike.
[00:39.700 --> 00:40.700]  How you guys doing?
[00:40.700 --> 00:43.700]  And over here is everybody's favorite. It's Jesse. How you doing, bro?
[00:43.700 --> 00:44.700]  Pretty good. How's it going?
[00:44.700 --> 00:45.700]  I'm good, man. Thanks for coming, you guys.
[00:45.700 --> 00:47.700]  Yeah. Thanks for having us back.
[00:47.700 --> 00:49.700]  Oh, for sure, man. Thanks.
[00:49.700 --> 00:53.700]  These guys actually messaged me today and they were like, podcast around 730.
[00:53.700 --> 00:55.700]  It's been a long Christmas season.
[00:55.700 --> 00:57.700]  About 830-ish, they all showed up.
[00:57.700 --> 01:00.700]  And now we're here to do a podcast.
[01:00.700 --> 01:06.700]  So, man, yeah, I want to apologize. I could tell that I'm going to sound stuffy. There may be a pause or two in this episode for me to take care of this.
[01:06.700 --> 01:12.700]  I got a broken pipe in my brain somewhere and my nose faucet is just dripping, dude. Oh my God. I don't know what I did.
[01:13.700 --> 01:16.700]  It's not real professional sounding. I apologize in advance.
[01:16.700 --> 01:18.700]  Need some plumbers crack?
[01:18.700 --> 01:21.700]  Yeah. No, wait. No plumbers crack in my face.
[01:21.700 --> 01:25.700]  Some plumbers putty or tape or some shit, but no plumbers crack in my face.
[01:25.700 --> 01:28.700]  Yeah, that's what I meant. How about plumbers on crack?
[01:28.700 --> 01:32.700]  Okay. As long as I can get here on time and get my nose fixed, I'm cool with it.
[01:32.700 --> 01:37.700]  I think enough. I've been drinking lots of good hydrating liquids and shit. I should be cool.
[01:37.700 --> 01:39.700]  Shout out to Coconut Water. That's been helping me out.
[01:39.700 --> 01:45.700]  I do owe a big shout out to Kooten Cat from the Mystic Roots Band for letting me play their music on the show. That's awesome. Thanks, guys.
[01:45.700 --> 01:49.700]  So, can we talk about the project you boys have been working on? Are we allowed to talk about that?
[01:49.700 --> 01:50.700]  Yeah, fuck yeah.
[01:50.700 --> 01:56.700]  These guys showed up here. They look beat, dude. All of them look like they have just been through the freaking ringer.
[01:56.700 --> 02:02.700]  Yeah, I run them pretty hard. It's been a long couple of weeks, but a good couple of weeks.
[02:02.700 --> 02:04.700]  Yeah, so Jesse is apparently the boss.
[02:04.700 --> 02:05.700]  Yeah.
[02:05.700 --> 02:07.700]  That's scary.
[02:08.700 --> 02:17.700]  Yeah, it's a long story. I'm a full-blown consultant. Let me tell you what. I'll do anything you need to get your place going.
[02:17.700 --> 02:22.700]  Including accidentally start a construction company.
[02:22.700 --> 02:30.700]  Yeah, he'll build your grow out, and then he'll supply it with grow supplies, and then him and I will teach you how to grow, and then we've got a grow team on hand if you need employees.
[02:30.700 --> 02:36.700]  We'll sell you genetics. We can hook you up with oil producers.
[02:37.700 --> 02:42.700]  Yeah, we do have quite a team here. So, you guys have been saying that Adam has fucking found his niche.
[02:42.700 --> 02:43.700]  We all thought.
[02:43.700 --> 02:48.700]  We found his wheelhouse, finally. We've been hunting for a while now, and we for sure found it.
[02:48.700 --> 02:49.700]  How long have you been here now, bro?
[02:49.700 --> 02:51.700]  It'll be a year in February.
[02:51.700 --> 02:53.700]  It'll be a year in February. Dude, you fill in pretty quickly.
[02:53.700 --> 02:57.700]  Yeah, I'm happy here, man. I was thinking about that today.
[02:58.700 --> 03:03.700]  Colorado's changed me for the better. I used to be a hermit and stuff like that.
[03:03.700 --> 03:06.700]  Just getting out. We all felt it today.
[03:06.700 --> 03:11.700]  When he asked me, let's go, and I'm like, yeah, I'm in.
[03:11.700 --> 03:18.700]  The other podcasts were great, but you felt it in you. You were like, I miss my friends.
[03:18.700 --> 03:20.700]  Yeah, dude. Sorry.
[03:20.700 --> 03:24.700]  No, it was fun doing those holiday shows without you guys. It was cool. I got to ramble.
[03:24.700 --> 03:33.700]  I felt an evolution in myself. If my voice changed, I honestly just stuck a wad of toilet paper in my nose to keep my nose from freaking running because it's dripping and it's disgusting.
[03:33.700 --> 03:34.700]  If I sound weird, that's why.
[03:34.700 --> 03:36.700]  It's not puberty issues.
[03:36.700 --> 03:38.700]  It's not me cracking.
[03:38.700 --> 03:48.700]  It was fun. I felt the evolution. Those earlier shows, when it was me on the mic by myself, it felt like I was reading this podcast is brought to you by nature's green remedies.com is what it felt like.
[03:48.700 --> 03:50.700]  They did get a little stuff there.
[03:50.700 --> 03:56.700]  I flipped the papers over that I had on the desk and just started talking. I was like, fuck all the notes. This is what I want to say.
[03:56.700 --> 03:59.700]  And it's fun. It's fun to kind of put it was way more comfortable.
[03:59.700 --> 04:05.700]  Yeah, it was. It was good. I didn't too much at the beginning. Know how to put nobody cared about me.
[04:05.700 --> 04:08.700]  Like, I didn't want to come out and be like, this is me and my podcast.
[04:08.700 --> 04:12.700]  I feel like I made friends with all my listeners. Yeah, they do. Sure. Kind of care.
[04:12.700 --> 04:18.700]  Interacting. So, yeah. So we're saying that Adams found his wheelhouse. This kid's a framer. He swings a hammer and frames like a champ.
[04:18.700 --> 04:24.700]  Kind of. Who would have known? Yeah, I've done it for a while, man. I mean, it's just it. I've had opportunities offered to me.
[04:24.700 --> 04:32.700]  Like, let's go start a business. And it's like, dude, you don't I have problems, you know, and at this table, a lot of these people kind of understand those problems.
[04:32.700 --> 04:38.700]  So, you know, it's it's that stoner kind of mentality where, you know, do not play well with others on some.
[04:38.700 --> 04:44.700]  I may not. But who doesn't? It's a job site. It's not fucking. It's not an office.
[04:44.700 --> 04:49.700]  You know, like you go off and cool off for 20. There's always one back. One guy at work every day.
[04:49.700 --> 04:54.700]  That one person has a problem and that one guy's got to stick up his ass and it seems to rotate.
[04:54.700 --> 05:01.700]  That's just how job sites are. We're doing construction and unheated, sometimes poorly or unlit warehouses.
[05:01.700 --> 05:05.700]  So, I mean, tempers can flare quickly, but we're Florida.
[05:05.700 --> 05:09.700]  We've got the team pretty chilled out and like, OK, go take a 20.
[05:09.700 --> 05:15.700]  Show yourself outbreak is standard. Nice. We've learned to swing it correctly.
[05:15.700 --> 05:19.700]  No tools go flying at each other. We have fun regularly anymore.
[05:19.700 --> 05:23.700]  Yeah. So there's a reason that's part of the reason why I don't do construction.
[05:23.700 --> 05:28.700]  I'd rather just be a lone wolf growing. So I kind of sometimes I'm like, man, these guys are having fun all day.
[05:28.700 --> 05:33.700]  I want to go to work somewhere with them. And then I'm like, or I could just maybe maybe one day.
[05:34.700 --> 05:39.700]  But as you know, as for me, I got to get I got to get some money set up before I can hit it.
[05:39.700 --> 05:44.700]  It's Tuesday night as we record. I actually have another meeting tomorrow in the morning at the spot.
[05:44.700 --> 05:50.700]  So things are starting to definitely come together. I was in there checking out the grow a few days ago.
[05:50.700 --> 05:52.700]  It's kind of a mess. They're getting a lot of shit done.
[05:52.700 --> 05:58.700]  The floors, the walls and the ceiling are all the same material and it looks like one sheet of everything.
[05:58.700 --> 06:03.700]  I can't find the seams and this material and these rooms are bigger than my house.
[06:03.700 --> 06:06.700]  I'm like, how the fuck did they do this? Dude, it's amazing.
[06:06.700 --> 06:09.700]  So when they get those finished, I'll be growing in there, but I'm going tomorrow.
[06:09.700 --> 06:13.700]  They're actually talking about sending me to there's a company that built our grow.
[06:13.700 --> 06:19.700]  They're talking about sending me to their flagship grow so that I can go check it out and see what happens and learn from their grow a little bit.
[06:19.700 --> 06:23.700]  That'll be neat. Nice. Is that a cannabis girl? It's a yeah, it's a cannabis girl.
[06:23.700 --> 06:26.700]  I think it's by I don't want to say the wrong name. I'm pretty sure.
[06:26.700 --> 06:29.700]  No, I was told that I was wrong about who made that there.
[06:29.700 --> 06:33.700]  There was a company that made it and then another guy kind of he was part of that company.
[06:33.700 --> 06:36.700]  He separated from them and improved on it and sold them the improved ideas.
[06:36.700 --> 06:40.700]  Yeah, yeah. Really? Go ahead. You see it? No.
[06:40.700 --> 06:44.700]  Seeing it get built is also a different perspective.
[06:44.700 --> 06:49.700]  Like, you know, we're not lights or anything like that, but just, you know, preparation for that.
[06:49.700 --> 06:54.700]  Yeah, yeah. Are they going to hire like a grow specific company to come in there and do that?
[06:54.700 --> 07:04.700]  Are you guys doing it all the way to the end? We're going to do it. Nice with the advice from, you know, I have reps phone numbers in my, you know, there you go.
[07:04.700 --> 07:14.700]  HVAC guys. Yeah. Well, we're having an HVAC company come in and put in specific units and guys, if you're building a specifically set up.
[07:14.700 --> 07:18.700]  So if you're building a personal grow, get a real electrician, just have them inspect everything.
[07:18.700 --> 07:24.700]  There's so many electricians on Craigslist and shit that are there legit. They're not going to snitch on you for growing herb.
[07:24.700 --> 07:30.700]  If you're in Colorado, get an electrician. Don't be that asshole that burned down your house by trying to grow too many lights in one room.
[07:30.700 --> 07:35.700]  There was a story in the paper today. Some idiot brewing hooch blew his house up.
[07:35.700 --> 07:43.700]  And I saw the photo and explosion in Pueblo County. I went, oh, shit, please. Fuck. No, fuck. No, fuck. No.
[07:43.700 --> 07:51.700]  I got down to alcohol. Yes. I don't want to give them the idea, but I strongly suspect they were making BHO in there.
[07:51.700 --> 07:56.700]  I don't, I don't see how alcohol would have. I mean, I don't know. No, that was a big thing during prohibition.
[07:56.700 --> 08:04.700]  This is why you can't make hard alcohol. Do people still do that? I don't know about here. I know a couple of guys from where I'm from.
[08:04.700 --> 08:09.700]  Absolutely. They do it up in the woods. Like, yeah, that's what I mean. They're not doing it in an apartment. Yeah.
[08:09.700 --> 08:15.700]  All right. So don't, don't be that asshole to blow some shit up guys. If you're making, I've got a news article that we're actually going to read a little later about making BHO.

[09:27.700 --> 09:35.700]  That's cool. Yes, it does. We've been having even more people hit us up on that. That's awesome. That's great. It's good to hear. People are local. People are listening to the show.
[09:36.700 --> 09:50.700]  People from other states are calling the store in place and orders to that's pretty sweet. We got a girl Kashi in two days ago. Grow Kashi. I've seen more girl Kashi in the past few days and I've I've heard it on the show. I still didn't know what it was.
[09:50.700 --> 09:57.700]  And yeah, maybe I'll go pick up a bag. I need to go to hygro for a couple of things in the near future. Maybe I'll pick up a bag. We'll talk about it on the show a little bit.
[09:57.700 --> 10:12.700]  Speaking of grow Kashi, I'm going to kind of branch off here. I saw a box of prizes being donated to the show from hygro Pueblo. There might be some grow Kashi. There might be some OGT. No, OGT is not going to be. I'm going to jack that out of there.
[10:12.700 --> 10:36.700]  There's a there's actually a bag of grow Kashi. There's some OGT and there are some other nutrients in there. There's some really cool things in there. Some grab bag or swag bags. Yeah. Our good friend task rocks sent us a highly educated t-shirt in size large. There are a couple few IRI genetics t-shirts. There are a couple of hat pins in there. There's an IRI sticker pack. Nice. Yeah.
[10:36.700 --> 11:04.700]  Spence from the Garden of Weeden may possibly have some prizes for us. I know there's a couple of Garden of Weeden stickers because I've got those. I'm hoping to get a shirt from him, but the man is busy. Yeah. So guys, check out episode 50. I'm hoping to have all three of these guys back plus Maddie and Spence, which means it's going to be crowded as I'm looking at the table. It's a busy time. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out a little bit more. Yeah, we've got more chairs over there. We'll figure it out. Yeah, I'll stand up the whole time and act like a game show host or something. Here we go.
[11:06.700 --> 11:24.700]  Yeah, there's not a whole lot to talk about in this episode, guys. I felt like crap today. I didn't prepare and I just wanted to have these guys over. We're going to kind of bullshit and read a news article. Before I do that, I got to say shout out to Tree Thugger dot com. This episode is brought to you in part by Tree Thugger dot com. Live music lifestyle magazine. Check out Tree Thugger dot com for concert and festival news and reviews.
[11:24.700 --> 11:50.700]  Www dot Tree Thugger dot com. I'm also supposed to say that if you're interested in sponsoring the show, send me an email at Grow From Your Heart at Hotmail dot com and I'll get you all the info that you need about that. I think that's all the show opening important part. I'm supposed to make sure I cover. All right. All right. You guys want to read a weird news article? Absolutely. There's four men sitting at this table and I'm about to say the word vagina a whole bunch of times.
[11:50.700 --> 12:19.700]  This article is from the cannabis. You know, it's cool about the cannabis. When I open up the cannabis website right on the top, there is an an advertisement for the spot. Southern Colorado's largest dispensary. No long waits, friendly bud tenders and new strains weekly. Visit us today at the spot. The spot did not pay for that ad, but I endorse the spot. There's a cute little bud tender with dreadlocks over there. Go visit her. Say what's up. She'll sell you some dank herbs. Yeah, go visit the spot. So the cannabis. This article is by Ricardo Baca.
[12:20.700 --> 12:34.700]  The headline is that we'd infuse sex lube for ladies. It'll be on Colorado shelves this month. That's what I said. Everybody in the room just looked at me like, what the fuck, dude? I've heard about this. I saw that this morning. I thought that was just some satire.
[12:34.700 --> 13:01.700]  I remember it says apply four to eight sprays directly onto the clitoris, inner and outer labia and inside the vagina.
[13:02.700 --> 13:08.700]  I always like counting the number of sprays in the middle of sex. Didn't they used to do the same thing with Lysol?
[13:08.700 --> 13:24.700]  Well, they actually said quite singular user instructions. So it's not during sex. This is by yourself. This chick sitting on the couch or somewhere. You do four and wait and see if you feel anything and then do three or four more later.
[13:25.700 --> 13:28.700]  What if it hits you like a truck?
[13:28.700 --> 13:33.700]  There's a mucous membrane. That's all a mucous membrane. It's going to happen quickly. That's going to be in a minute.
[13:33.700 --> 13:35.700]  That sounds horrible.
[13:35.700 --> 13:40.700]  I'm all for the product. I just, the number of pumps then comes a little off the top.
[13:40.700 --> 13:43.700]  That's what I want to know. Why is it always like I get it.
[13:44.700 --> 13:47.700]  So I'm going to continue with the article before it goes on a porn rant.
[13:47.700 --> 13:53.700]  That interview with Los Angeles based Floria founder Matthew Gerson helps introduce the unique product to the masses.
[13:53.700 --> 13:59.700]  And now Gerson, who originally hails from Boulder, is debuting his special non-psychoactive lube outside of California for the very first time.
[13:59.700 --> 14:07.700]  Floria will make its Colorado debut at the native roots location in Aspen during the Winter X Games on January 21st through 25th.
[14:07.700 --> 14:11.700]  That's confusing. What are they targeting?
[14:11.700 --> 14:16.700]  You're debuting your THC infused sex lube at the X Games.
[14:16.700 --> 14:20.700]  I know I'm high, but I totally just heard all those words in the correct order.
[14:20.700 --> 14:24.700]  I don't know if I want to cross the line of words I want to say on this show right now.
[14:24.700 --> 14:29.700]  Your pussy got all beat up at the X Games. Here's some lube to make it freaking feel a little better.
[14:31.700 --> 14:37.700]  Okay, so the article says, I came out to LA from Colorado and I've been trying to get back ever since.
[14:37.700 --> 14:43.700]  Gerson told the Cannabis I'm super excited to be bringing it to Colorado and native roots is a good alignment for us.
[14:43.700 --> 14:45.700]  So it'll be available at native roots.
[14:45.700 --> 14:49.700]  Need a reminder on what Floria is per Gerson from my June interview with him.
[14:49.700 --> 14:52.700]  It's a sensual enhancement oil designed for female pleasure.
[14:52.700 --> 14:54.700]  A therapeutic aphrodisiac.
[14:54.700 --> 14:58.700]  Women have described it as relaxing and they've said it's heightened their sensations.
[14:58.700 --> 15:03.700]  They've associated it with warming and tingling localized in the sexual region.
[15:03.700 --> 15:04.700]  Well, that's where you're spraying it.
[15:04.700 --> 15:06.700]  You're going to feel it on your arm.
[15:06.700 --> 15:08.700]  Florida will be on sale at native roots.
[15:08.700 --> 15:16.700]  Native roots is new Aspen location at 308 South Hunter Street throughout the X Games and all other native roots locations after the big event.
[15:16.700 --> 15:18.700]  Native roots is Floria's partner in Colorado.
[15:18.700 --> 15:22.700]  And how have the last six months been for Floria in California?
[15:22.700 --> 15:35.700]  He says we never could have imagined the impact it's having on the patient community in California and how it's been to the spectrum of users from younger women who are looking to deepen looking to deepen the level of intimacy of their own bodies to older women who are experiencing.
[15:36.700 --> 15:38.700]  A reawakening of their own sexuality.
[15:38.700 --> 15:45.700]  Gerson said there are a large number of women who could benefit from cannabis, but who aren't interested in the psychoactive component.
[15:45.700 --> 15:48.700]  The products expansion into Colorado is only the beginning.
[15:48.700 --> 15:49.700]  Gerson estimates.
[15:49.700 --> 15:54.700]  Floria will be available in Washington State pot stores in the next few months.
[15:54.700 --> 15:56.700]  Does anybody else want to get this for a chick?
[15:56.700 --> 15:59.700]  They hate and be like, I got this great perfume.
[15:59.700 --> 16:01.700]  Just like you.
[16:02.700 --> 16:06.700]  To get you a bottle and when you take a big dad and start crying, I can do that to spray.
[16:06.700 --> 16:07.700]  Absolutely.
[16:07.700 --> 16:10.700]  I would spray the roast beef sandwich down.
[16:10.700 --> 16:12.700]  Did non psychoactive non psychoactive.
[16:12.700 --> 16:13.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[16:13.700 --> 16:14.700]  Yeah.
[16:14.700 --> 16:15.700]  OK, it's not.
[16:17.700 --> 16:18.700]  I don't know.
[16:18.700 --> 16:28.700]  I know a guy that claims he made a lube using coconut oil and cannabis, and he says when he uses it on chicks that they definitely enjoy it a lot more than when he doesn't use it.
[16:29.700 --> 16:32.700]  I just wanted I thought it'd be fun to read this with four dudes at the table.
[16:32.700 --> 16:37.700]  So I cannabis a lot more when I use it prior than when I don't use it.
[16:37.700 --> 16:38.700]  The article was awesome.
[16:38.700 --> 16:40.700]  It's just fucking.
[16:40.700 --> 16:42.700]  I've heard of puns and shit.
[16:42.700 --> 16:43.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[16:43.700 --> 16:51.700]  I've heard a lot of placebo warnings about this, you know, whereas in it, I paid $80 for it.
[16:51.700 --> 16:52.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:52.700 --> 16:53.700]  Better tingle.
[16:53.700 --> 16:57.700]  If she's going to if she's sprayed it on her clit and inner and outer labia, it's working.
[16:57.700 --> 17:00.700]  It's already moistened and shit up and that's waking it up a little.
[17:00.700 --> 17:02.700]  So even if it doesn't work.
[17:02.700 --> 17:10.700]  But have you ever eaten like tincture or I guess it just tincture that doesn't you get warm inside like you feel warm and fuzzy.
[17:10.700 --> 17:14.700]  I can just imagine spending some tincture on my junk, though, letting it get all sticky and gross.
[17:14.700 --> 17:18.700]  That's what I felt that night from that mountain bar.
[17:18.700 --> 17:21.700]  You know, that's that's the whole feeling that I really got.
[17:21.700 --> 17:23.700]  Did you did you get a mountain bar on your junk?
[17:23.700 --> 17:24.700]  No, no, no.
[17:24.700 --> 17:26.700]  Try that next time.
[17:26.700 --> 17:27.700]  That'll be $12.
[17:27.700 --> 17:28.700]  Well spent.
[17:28.700 --> 17:29.700]  I'll tell you how much right now.
[17:29.700 --> 17:33.700]  I think three hundred and fifty milligrams back to T.H.C. right to my tank.
[17:33.700 --> 17:35.700]  Yeah, I'm done.
[17:35.700 --> 17:39.700]  I refrain myself from using taint early.
[17:39.700 --> 17:42.700]  Show just got really, really weird.
[17:42.700 --> 17:43.700]  Don't worry.
[17:43.700 --> 17:44.700]  I've done ruin that for you.
[17:44.700 --> 17:48.700]  So I know a product that definitely does work that apothecary pain relief.
[17:48.700 --> 17:51.700]  Yeah, with the juniper arnica cannabis stuff.
[17:51.700 --> 17:53.700]  Dude, I didn't believe in it.
[17:53.700 --> 17:54.700]  It's a topical.
[17:54.700 --> 17:58.700]  It's definitely I was skeptical about it because I'm a pothead.
[17:58.700 --> 18:01.700]  I think you got to smoke weed or consume cannabis somehow to get high.
[18:01.700 --> 18:06.700]  Right. But my girlfriend actually, the Grammy Gatsby gave me a bottle of that apothecary.
[18:06.700 --> 18:09.700]  And I rub my girlfriend down with it for like an hour and a half one night.
[18:09.700 --> 18:14.700]  And my to quote Pink Floyd, my hands felt just like two balloons.
[18:14.700 --> 18:17.700]  They felt I felt like I had Mickey Mouse gloves on.
[18:17.700 --> 18:19.700]  I was like, oh, my hands are big.
[18:19.700 --> 18:23.700]  I felt all like fluffy and bigger than they were a dream or something.
[18:23.700 --> 18:24.700]  Yeah, kind of. Yeah.
[18:24.700 --> 18:29.700]  Like I'd go to like scratch my face and punch myself in the head a little bit because my fingers were there already.
[18:29.700 --> 18:32.700]  It was like, what is this? We it's like I had boxing gloves on.
[18:32.700 --> 18:36.700]  My mom used that and she said she got high shit from it.
[18:36.700 --> 18:42.700]  I don't know about getting high shit from it, but I definitely felt my mom's a very small smoker, though.
[18:42.700 --> 18:43.700]  OK, maybe she did.
[18:43.700 --> 18:49.700]  It definitely helps. I start off the massage with just coconut oil to kind of start a massage.
[18:49.700 --> 18:53.700]  You get her loosened up and get her lubed. I didn't try to avoid the word lube.
[18:53.700 --> 18:57.700]  And if I use that apothecary right away, it absorbs in too quickly and I don't think it spreads enough.
[18:57.700 --> 19:00.700]  So I get her coconut oiled and then I put the apothecary in there.
[19:00.700 --> 19:05.700]  Definitely. I can tell that she can I can see that she loosens up as soon as that apothecary starts getting in there.
[19:05.700 --> 19:09.700]  It's why I had to use that word. There was nothing else to describe it.
[19:09.700 --> 19:14.700]  He knew. He gets it. He didn't want to use lube, but I didn't want to use the word lube.
[19:14.700 --> 19:17.700]  But sometimes you got to take that job and say words that you're trying to avoid.
[19:17.700 --> 19:21.700]  A lot of people don't like the word moist. I've noticed moist like really.
[19:21.700 --> 19:29.700]  It's the way some people say it. Moist, moist, moist, like a properly like you've been using that spray.
[19:29.700 --> 19:32.700]  Like you've been using that cannabis spray, maybe. All right.
[19:32.700 --> 19:36.700]  We're going to try to put this show back on track. Here's another article from the cannabis.
[19:36.700 --> 19:43.700]  This car can see I'm so fucking lost. I can't even talk. I still got this Kleenex in my nose to face stamp on.
[19:43.700 --> 19:48.700]  This article is written by John Engle and Jordan Steffen from the Denver Post.
[19:48.700 --> 19:52.700]  The headline is hash oil legality now questioned for Colorado courts.
[19:52.700 --> 19:57.700]  And then the sub headline is by the end of Wednesday hearing, Denver District Court Judge A.
[19:57.700 --> 20:02.700]  Bruce Jones had concluded both sides were wrong, though it was still unclear how he would ultimately rule.
[20:03.700 --> 20:07.700]  Side note, students name is a Bruce Jones. Are you a bad motherfucker?
[20:07.700 --> 20:12.700]  If your first name is just an initial, it's actually a typographical error.
[20:12.700 --> 20:21.700]  Let led me be called or led me being called D for like two and a half years during public school.
[20:21.700 --> 20:26.700]  That's frustrating. Yeah. This dude chose to do it. He's a Bruce Jones.
[20:26.700 --> 20:31.700]  He chose to do it or his parents just tagged. So I guess if I wanted to be a poet or something, my middle name is Scott.
[20:31.700 --> 20:35.700]  So I'd be J. Scott. And then my last name, I almost said it in the show, but I'm going to do that.
[20:35.700 --> 20:41.700]  But I'm J. J. Scott Rasta. Like you want to go that way? You don't have to change your name.
[20:41.700 --> 20:45.700]  That sounds what's the just be that really sophisticated. Is that what he's trying to do?
[20:45.700 --> 20:50.700]  There is or is his first name just like. 17 letters and starts with a.
[20:50.700 --> 20:59.700]  It's so funny. Their little nickname for me at work and shit is what I used to get teased as as like five.
[20:59.700 --> 21:06.700]  And I mean, that's what used to hurt, you know, like when you're a kid and the kids find that one thing, you know, like, you know, just go at it forever.
[21:06.700 --> 21:10.700]  Dude, I mean, I'm I'm an adult now, so it's fine.
[21:10.700 --> 21:13.700]  But, you know, there's those times where it's both of them sitting in the corner.
[21:13.700 --> 21:17.700]  Let's say I'm sitting here trying to remember what year the Joe Dirt was released.
[21:17.700 --> 21:22.700]  I don't know. It was when you were five. That was actually that was shot from afar.
[21:22.700 --> 21:27.700]  They just followed me around. So if Joe Dirt and if you I don't know if you guys watch King of the Hill,
[21:27.700 --> 21:32.700]  but if Lucky from King of the Hill and Joe Dirt had a kid, it would be Adam.
[21:32.700 --> 21:36.700]  Yeah. And his name would be 44. Yeah, you do it.
[21:36.700 --> 21:43.700]  Yeah. Forty four. Dear D. I've been calling him Joe Dirt lately for a whole nother reason.
[21:43.700 --> 21:46.700]  So dang, it's a handy little mother. Do you want to.
[21:46.700 --> 21:49.700]  I kind of want to know you want to do.
[21:49.700 --> 21:52.700]  You want to tell the story about what you did with your shatter the other day. Oh, yeah.
[21:52.700 --> 21:55.700]  All right. So let me anybody out there that's a little inexperienced.
[21:55.700 --> 21:57.700]  I'm from the South. I've not been dabbing that long.
[21:57.700 --> 22:01.700]  But so I took shatter to work and I was like, oh, it's all cold.
[22:01.700 --> 22:06.700]  And we we got in the car and I'm sitting there and I'm like, let's let's do a dab.
[22:06.700 --> 22:09.700]  Let's see. You know. Yeah, that doesn't work.
[22:09.700 --> 22:13.700]  So I try and it's shattering everywhere and I'm spilling it.
[22:13.700 --> 22:16.700]  I probably lost half a gram that way. And I was like, you know what I'll do?
[22:16.700 --> 22:19.700]  I'll pick it up. I'll hold the torch and I'll just, you know,
[22:19.700 --> 22:23.700]  waft it and I'll use my thumb is like a guard to protect the heat.
[22:23.700 --> 22:24.700]  And that worked fine. That was great.
[22:24.700 --> 22:32.700]  You were attempting to blow torch the hash lightly to kind of melt it a little bit to make it more correctly in between two pieces of parchment paper.
[22:32.700 --> 22:36.700]  All right. This is some high quality concentrates. He's talking. Yeah.
[22:36.700 --> 22:40.700]  And this is Colorado and it's been the best.
[22:40.700 --> 22:45.700]  So it's definitely some of the best hash around, you know, town and stuff.
[22:45.700 --> 22:48.700]  So I fucked it up. I was like, this is working.
[22:48.700 --> 22:51.700]  I'll just set it down and do the same thing. Listen to me, people.
[22:51.700 --> 22:59.700]  Don't do that. Hold it in your hands or. Yeah, I burned a bunch of money that day for nothing.
[22:59.700 --> 23:02.700]  It just went up and it was way too late by that part.
[23:02.700 --> 23:07.700]  You know, like, yeah, it's like a match book. I felt bad for you.
[23:07.700 --> 23:10.700]  No, nobody else did. They all laughed. I learned something.
[23:10.700 --> 23:13.700]  So I learned. Yeah, no, it was totally. I laughed later.
[23:13.700 --> 23:15.700]  Which is not that funny. Yeah.
[23:16.700 --> 23:21.700]  It wasn't funny to him in the moment, but it was great and will continue to be great.
[23:21.700 --> 23:25.700]  Funny to everybody else. Break time really sucked at that point in time.
[23:25.700 --> 23:27.700]  And I break. Yeah, I was like I was done with the day.
[23:27.700 --> 23:32.700]  Anybody bring any shatter? No, because I'm out because I'm broke because you burned it all.
[23:32.700 --> 23:37.700]  Yeah, I got a little over here. That was that was an expensive fucking day.
[23:37.700 --> 23:40.700]  I've got some unicorn hash. I'm sorry.
[23:41.700 --> 23:44.700]  I actually dabbed up all my unicorn hash last night.
[23:44.700 --> 23:48.700]  I got a little half a container for Friday.
[23:48.700 --> 23:51.700]  I forget what we saw today, but we saw a unicorn.
[23:51.700 --> 23:55.700]  It was it was just rarity. It was on the way to work.
[23:55.700 --> 23:59.700]  I can't I don't remember what it was. Now I'll ask in the morning what we saw.
[23:59.700 --> 24:02.700]  But you saw it was definitely unicorn status.
[24:02.700 --> 24:05.700]  You saw something that was so cool. You don't even know what the fuck it was.
[24:05.700 --> 24:08.700]  No, it's just rare. You know, that's that's weird.
[24:08.700 --> 24:12.700]  Yeah, I said I was going to read a news article. I'm going to take a dab and then try that.
[24:12.700 --> 24:17.700]  This is going to be like my third dab of the day when it's 915.
[24:17.700 --> 24:21.700]  Usually I start off the day with a couple of fat dads.
[24:21.700 --> 24:25.700]  If I tell you anything about how I felt today, I've been trying to get hydrated, dude.
[24:25.700 --> 24:27.700]  It's so hard to get hydrated once you're dehydrated and being sick.
[24:27.700 --> 24:30.700]  Don't drink that then. Don't drink this. Yeah.
[24:30.700 --> 24:33.700]  The bong water is water. You're just like, I got to get hydrated.
[24:33.700 --> 24:36.700]  Yeah, we're talking about being hydrated and pick up the rig.
[24:36.700 --> 24:39.700]  That'd be great. Thanks for being a friend. That would have been miserable.
[24:39.700 --> 24:43.700]  There's probably like a good gram of reclaim just floating on top of that shit.
[24:43.700 --> 24:45.700]  That would have been the worst drink ever.
[24:45.700 --> 24:52.700]  Anybody out there would definitely pay money to just like scrape your your pipes, you know, and your reclaim.
[24:52.700 --> 24:56.700]  There's I was on tiny chat last night and I showed somebody my hash.
[24:56.700 --> 25:00.700]  Oh, no. And he's like, is that your dad? And I was like, no.
[25:00.700 --> 25:03.700]  And he goes, just dab it. And so I weighed it and it was point five.
[25:03.700 --> 25:08.700]  And I was like, well, OK. And so I typed it's point five and he just nodded like, uh-huh.
[25:08.700 --> 25:10.700]  Then I was like, God damn it. This guy knows me.
[25:10.700 --> 25:14.700]  And so I did a half gram dab last night on tiny chat and it was fun.
[25:14.700 --> 25:18.700]  And then I went to bed. Yeah. Sometimes I am on TV live, guys.
[25:18.700 --> 25:23.700]  That is me. If you wondered if you're ever cruising through TV live and you see that white guy with the dreadlocks and an Irish shirt.
[25:23.700 --> 25:27.700]  I've always got my sunglasses and a hat on taking dabs. That's me, bro.
[25:27.700 --> 25:30.700]  That is me. I'm Rasta Jeff on there. Say what's up if you want to.
[25:31.700 --> 25:41.700]  Somebody talk while I take a dab. We were talking earlier today that 50 is going to be jam packed full of chaos and that's going to be great.
[25:41.700 --> 25:45.700]  I'm so pumped for 50, like the giveaway and all that stuff.
[25:45.700 --> 25:49.700]  I'm sure everybody's pumped for, but I'm just pumped to get everybody.
[25:49.700 --> 25:54.700]  It's already been 50 episodes, man. Like I was just talking about that with him today.
[25:55.700 --> 26:01.700]  When you really keep track of them and put a number to them, it hurts. You realize how far it goes.
[26:01.700 --> 26:09.700]  It goes so quickly. Every week I do an episode. I've done a couple of episodes, weeks where I've done multiple episodes, too.
[26:09.700 --> 26:13.700]  I'd like to be able to do that, but I feel like I bore the people. I don't have enough content.
[26:13.700 --> 26:17.700]  It's just me rambling when I do two episodes. It's kind of a big dab for you, bro.
[26:17.700 --> 26:20.700]  We might need to get you some of that flurry after this.
[26:21.700 --> 26:28.700]  I'm pumped for the crowd. I like all these people. Gatherings, it's usually two people you enjoy and 13 people that you tolerate.
[26:28.700 --> 26:33.700]  If the guest list for 50 shows up and everyone's here, it's going to be sick.
[26:34.700 --> 26:40.700]  Well, they set the date. So, hopefully, yeah. Spence and Maddy were the ones that said when we're doing this.
[26:40.700 --> 26:46.700]  What the hell was that? Okay. I saw Adam hitting the rig and I heard that noise. I was like, what the fuck just happened?
[26:46.700 --> 26:50.700]  Well, you got some claim on you, bro. Is that burn? Not after a long day of work.
[26:50.700 --> 26:54.700]  There's a light coating of hot metal shavings over most of his hands.
[26:54.700 --> 26:57.700]  Yeah, you probably picked them right here in front of my hair.
[26:57.700 --> 26:58.700]  Rig, bro?
[27:00.700 --> 27:07.700]  Yeah, it's on, Mike. As long as it doesn't involve anything with me putting my hands over my head, it can burn, whatever.
[27:07.700 --> 27:13.700]  That's the worst part of your guys' job, from what I've heard, is hanging drywall and metal beams above your head all day.
[27:14.700 --> 27:15.700]  Doing anything above your head.
[27:15.700 --> 27:17.700]  Everyone just went silent after that.
[27:17.700 --> 27:24.700]  I'm totally down to carry soil or water or whatever because it's below my waist. No more ceiling.
[27:24.700 --> 27:30.700]  Dude, at the new grow at the spot, there's no carrying. There are carts, like the janitor cart.
[27:30.700 --> 27:33.700]  I got one of those for all my shit. Just push it around.
[27:33.700 --> 27:36.700]  I'm sure they'll be there eventually.
[27:36.700 --> 27:41.700]  Yeah. I'm so excited to have upgraded from my smaller facilities.
[27:41.700 --> 27:49.700]  One of my first grows was in my mom's basement in the closet in a grow hut.
[27:49.700 --> 27:51.700]  In a little tiny, tiny...
[27:51.700 --> 27:55.700]  And now I've got a five-gallon bucket of water.
[27:55.700 --> 27:57.700]  Yeah, that's all it took.
[27:57.700 --> 27:58.700]  Yeah, exactly.
[27:58.700 --> 28:02.700]  Flush the plants by carrying them to the bathtub and just rinse them out a little bit.
[28:02.700 --> 28:05.700]  Where are you guys getting that oil on you from? Where's it coming from on there?
[28:05.700 --> 28:07.700]  I'll clean it up if you can identify the leak.
[28:07.700 --> 28:11.700]  I think it's just coming out of the carb cap, honestly.
[28:11.700 --> 28:15.700]  Probably is the carb cap now that you say that. Everything over here is just dirty.
[28:15.700 --> 28:16.700]  I had to...
[28:16.700 --> 28:18.700]  You think you...
[28:18.700 --> 28:21.700]  Dirty. Yeah. No, I cleaned yours the other day.
[28:21.700 --> 28:26.700]  I need a cleaner monkey that just walks around behind me and cleans up after me all day.
[28:26.700 --> 28:29.700]  Let me tell you, people, if you think you smoke a lot of dabs, like...
[28:30.700 --> 28:36.700]  There are resin... I mean, there's fucking reclaim coming off the end of the torch here.
[28:38.700 --> 28:40.700]  Yeah, that's true.
[28:40.700 --> 28:44.700]  I've got five oil slick pads on the table.
[28:44.700 --> 28:46.700]  They're all just stained to shit.
[28:46.700 --> 28:48.700]  They're all stuck together.
[28:48.700 --> 28:50.700]  The carb cap's sitting right in the middle of the table, just sitting there.
[28:50.700 --> 28:55.700]  A non-picky person could get dabbed the fuck out off the claim stuck to my oil slick pads.
[28:55.700 --> 28:59.700]  I had someone ask me for the reclaim in my work rig the other day.
[28:59.700 --> 29:01.700]  It's pretty substantial.
[29:01.700 --> 29:03.700]  It's just a cheap little rig.
[29:03.700 --> 29:06.700]  As long as I can suck through it, it's cool.
[29:06.700 --> 29:08.700]  But, yeah, I'd never even consider...
[29:08.700 --> 29:14.700]  I was like, I'll just mix that shit with fucking Formula 420 or whatever.
[29:14.700 --> 29:15.700]  Just get it right out of there.
[29:15.700 --> 29:16.700]  Be gone.
[29:16.700 --> 29:19.700]  I've seen a lot of people make edibles out of the reclaim.
[29:19.700 --> 29:20.700]  That's gross.
[29:20.700 --> 29:21.700]  Yeah.
[29:21.700 --> 29:22.700]  That doesn't sound...
[29:22.700 --> 29:23.700]  Nasty.
[29:23.700 --> 29:26.700]  All this BHO talk leads me right into this news article that I was attempting to read.
[29:26.700 --> 29:28.700]  So that's perfect.
[29:28.700 --> 29:30.700]  Yeah, you're going to hear a couple of weird breaths from me.
[29:30.700 --> 29:32.700]  I can feel my nose trying to run.
[29:32.700 --> 29:33.700]  All right.
[29:33.700 --> 29:39.700]  It says, a court hearing Wednesday to determine the legal status of marijuana hash oil in post-legislation Colorado
[29:39.700 --> 29:43.700]  resulted in the judge turning up his hands and shrugging his shoulders in exasperation.
[29:43.700 --> 29:45.700]  Mike's pulling out his phone to take a picture of me
[29:45.700 --> 29:49.700]  because I got this big wad of toilet paper stuffed in my nose while I'm doing a podcast.
[29:49.700 --> 29:51.700]  I wasn't, but now I'm going to.
[29:52.700 --> 29:54.700]  The nasal tampon.
[29:54.700 --> 29:59.700]  The hearing in Denver District Court was to decide whether a man named Paul Manione,
[29:59.700 --> 30:00.700]  Manione?
[30:00.700 --> 30:02.700]  Mani- Man-ay-one.
[30:02.700 --> 30:07.700]  This guy, Paul, who was one of the three people charged after an explosion at a Southwest Denver warehouse
[30:07.700 --> 30:11.700]  can be prosecuted for the crime of manufacturing marijuana concentrate.
[30:11.700 --> 30:15.700]  The man's attorney, Rob Corey, who helped write Colorado's marijuana legalization law,
[30:16.700 --> 30:22.700]  said, Manione can't be charged because of Colorado's constitution now protects the personal possession of marijuana
[30:22.700 --> 30:24.700]  and the processing of marijuana plants.
[30:24.700 --> 30:29.700]  The court system is not to be used for marijuana regulation anymore, Corey said.
[30:29.700 --> 30:31.700]  I wish he would have said cannabis. It would have made it a lot better.
[30:31.700 --> 30:35.700]  The Colorado attorney general argues, Manione can be charged because,
[30:35.700 --> 30:39.700]  by virtue of a curiously placed comma in Amendment 64,
[30:39.700 --> 30:45.700]  the legalization measure, the protection for marijuana, does not cover cannabis oil like hash oil.
[30:45.700 --> 30:50.700]  The measure says its definition for marijuana does not include industrial hemp,
[30:50.700 --> 30:56.700]  nor does it include fiber produced from the stocks, oil, or cake made from the seeds of the plant.
[30:56.700 --> 30:59.700]  The attorney general's office, which weighed in on Manione's case,
[30:59.700 --> 31:05.700]  even though it is not prosecuting the case, has made a similar argument in a case in Mesa County.
[31:05.700 --> 31:11.700]  By the end of Wednesday's hearing, Denver District Judge A. Bruce Jones had concluded both sides were wrong,
[31:11.700 --> 31:14.700]  though it was still unclear how he would ultimately rule.
[31:14.700 --> 31:20.700]  Jones said he plans to deny Corey's motion to drop the charge, meaning the case against Manione can proceed.
[31:20.700 --> 31:24.700]  And here's kind of, we're getting into the part where it's all technical.
[31:24.700 --> 31:31.700]  Hash oil is the potent goop left over after marijuana's active chemicals are dissolved from the underlying plant material.
[31:31.700 --> 31:34.700]  That guy tried real hard. He tried hard.
[31:35.700 --> 31:37.700]  It's the nasty stuff.
[31:37.700 --> 31:40.700]  Hash oil is the hash that we want.
[31:40.700 --> 31:48.700]  Everyone involved in this story and this article is at best trying hard. Nobody succeeded.
[31:48.700 --> 31:53.700]  The cannabis often tries really hard, but they need somebody, they need a guy like you, Mike.
[31:53.700 --> 31:58.700]  You should contact the cannabis and be like, hey, you guys say a lot of dumb shit.
[31:59.700 --> 32:07.700]  They tell their stories right. Nothing is inaccurate here except the wording, hash oil is the potent goop left over after marijuana's active chemicals are dissolved.
[32:07.700 --> 32:08.700]  It's not oil.
[32:08.700 --> 32:09.700]  I mean...
[32:09.700 --> 32:15.700]  Well, the oil that, the oil, the sentence in question in the bill is about hemp seed oil.
[32:15.700 --> 32:22.700]  If you take hemp seed and you gather it up and you press it sort of like you do grapes to make wine, you get an oil that you can make.
[32:22.700 --> 32:27.700]  Everything you can make with oil, oil, like Texans haul out of the ground oil.
[32:27.700 --> 32:30.700]  And that's what they're referencing in that part of the bill.
[32:30.700 --> 32:34.700]  Hash oil isn't oil oil or cannabis oil.
[32:34.700 --> 32:38.700]  We just call it oil because it kind of looks like...
[32:38.700 --> 32:40.700]  Yeah, it's honey oil when it comes out.
[32:40.700 --> 32:41.700]  Yeah, but like...
[32:41.700 --> 32:44.700]  So they're being sticklers about a technicality.
[32:44.700 --> 32:46.700]  I love watching it drip out of the end of the tube.
[32:46.700 --> 32:48.700]  Over a descriptive slang term.
[32:48.700 --> 32:50.700]  Yeah, that's what I keep thinking.
[32:50.700 --> 32:51.700]  Because that's what I keep thinking.
[32:51.700 --> 32:53.700]  I'm like, it's not really an oil.
[32:53.700 --> 32:58.700]  Well, and the judge isn't going to drop the case because I'm pretty sure this fuck nut blew up his house.
[32:58.700 --> 32:59.700]  Yeah, there's more to the story.
[32:59.700 --> 33:01.700]  Let me read part of that in a little bit.
[33:01.700 --> 33:06.700]  Blowing up your house has long been a crime in Colorado that was not legalized at any time recently.
[33:06.700 --> 33:10.700]  And that's something that Rob Corey mentions, and I'm going to have an argument later on in the story.
[33:10.700 --> 33:12.700]  I think you agree with me now.
[33:12.700 --> 33:13.700]  No, I like it.
[33:13.700 --> 33:14.700]  I like forward thinking people.
[33:14.700 --> 33:15.700]  That's awesome.
[33:15.700 --> 33:18.700]  We don't have to sit in the backseat of our minds and fucking let everybody else drive us.
[33:18.700 --> 33:19.700]  Think forward.
[33:19.700 --> 33:21.700]  So hash oil, they describe it wrong.
[33:21.700 --> 33:31.700]  And then it says a popular amateur production method uses compressed butane gas, which can lead to dangerous explosions like the one that rocked the 1200 block of South Lippin Street last April.
[33:31.700 --> 33:35.700]  Man, Ione is also charged with arson in connection with that blast.
[33:35.700 --> 33:42.700]  During Wednesday's hearing, Corey argued that home hash oil explosions are mistakes, but not illegal.
[33:42.700 --> 33:45.700]  I compare it to frying a turkey, Corey said.
[33:45.700 --> 33:48.700]  Accidents don't mean a crime has occurred.
[33:48.700 --> 33:51.700]  Jones didn't seem impressed, calling some of Corey's arguments circular.
[33:51.700 --> 33:55.700]  But Jones also criticized an attorney general's position.
[33:55.700 --> 33:57.700]  I'm going to tell him he's wrong.
[33:57.700 --> 33:59.700]  I'm going to tell him he's way wrong, Jones said.
[33:59.700 --> 34:08.700]  So he compared it to if I'm cooking a chicken and I burn the apartment building down or a turkey, then I made a mistake.
[34:08.700 --> 34:16.700]  But I think I'm still recklessly endangering people, and I think charges are going to be pressed on me even if I do burn down my apartment building, right?
[34:16.700 --> 34:25.700]  If you're frying a turkey in the living room of your apartment, you're A, an idiot, B, violating the fire code.
[34:25.700 --> 34:26.700]  What if I'm doing it in the kitchen?
[34:26.700 --> 34:27.700]  Well, no, in the kitchen too.
[34:27.700 --> 34:29.700]  If you're going to fry a turkey, you've got to take that shit outside.
[34:29.700 --> 34:30.700]  What if I'm just cooking dinner?
[34:30.700 --> 34:41.700]  If I'm cooking dinner in the kitchen and I'm just cooking normal food, I got veggie burgers and some fucking vegetables and some rice and some macaroni or whatever, and I fucking, I take a dab and I come back and the kitchen's on fire.
[34:41.700 --> 34:42.700]  Boosh.
[34:42.700 --> 34:43.700]  Right.
[34:43.700 --> 34:45.700]  Am I going to face charges for something now?
[34:45.700 --> 34:49.700]  No, as long as you were just, it was innocent.
[34:49.700 --> 34:53.700]  You might be legally liable for damages or something.
[34:53.700 --> 34:54.700]  I don't know.
[34:54.700 --> 34:56.700]  A lot of that depends on where you are at the time.
[34:56.700 --> 34:58.700]  And Mike's not a lawyer.
[34:58.700 --> 35:00.700]  He just stayed at a Holiday Inn Express last night.
[35:00.700 --> 35:07.700]  That part of Corey's argument here is correct, but that doesn't apply to butane hash oil.
[35:07.700 --> 35:11.700]  You're venting cans of flammable gas into an enclosed space.
[35:11.700 --> 35:14.700]  Which is actually an OSHA crime, I think, or some sort of environmental-
[35:14.700 --> 35:18.700]  That's a special thing in the fire code for sure.
[35:18.700 --> 35:31.700]  When I asked the fire chief down here, because Pueblo outlawed making a BHO a while ago, and when the vote passed, right after it passed, I stood up and walked back to the fire chief and jokingly asked,
[35:32.700 --> 35:36.700]  venting cans of butane into your living room and lighting a match has been illegal for how long?
[35:36.700 --> 35:39.700]  And he chuckled and went, longer than I've been on the job.
[35:39.700 --> 35:45.700]  Because that's the thing, you can't dump gasoline around your apartment and light a match.
[35:45.700 --> 35:50.700]  And if you're venting cans of butane inside, you're venting cans of flammable gas into an enclosed space.
[35:50.700 --> 35:53.700]  If your pilot light kicks on, your eyebrows are kicking off.
[35:53.700 --> 35:57.700]  All your windows are kicking out and you're going to the burn unit.
[35:57.700 --> 36:00.700]  Yeah, the burn, and not the good burn unit.
[36:00.700 --> 36:02.700]  But there's not a special charge for-
[36:02.700 --> 36:06.700]  Well, yeah, there used to be a place we called the burn unit, where we used to go burn.
[36:06.700 --> 36:07.700]  Some kind of endangerment.
[36:07.700 --> 36:08.700]  Reckless endangerment.
[36:08.700 --> 36:13.700]  I heard a dub band once called burn unit.
[36:13.700 --> 36:14.700]  Yeah, I think so.
[36:14.700 --> 36:15.700]  Alright, so-
[36:15.700 --> 36:16.700]  I'm sheltered.
[36:16.700 --> 36:17.700]  I'm going to finish the article.
[36:17.700 --> 36:21.700]  Caught almost on the sidelines was the Denver District Attorney's Office, which is actually prosecuting the case.
[36:22.700 --> 36:25.700]  A deputy district attorney said the hash oil qualifies as pot.
[36:25.700 --> 36:33.700]  But he said there's a difference between Amendment 64's protection for processing marijuana and the state laws for criminalizing of manufacturing concentrated marijuana.
[36:33.700 --> 36:36.700]  Jones is expected to issue his ruling in the coming weeks.
[36:36.700 --> 36:47.700]  So they're saying that there's a major difference between processing, which is properly doing that shit in a facility, in a tested, authorized, MED approved lab.
[36:47.700 --> 36:51.700]  That's also been state regulated by the health department.
[36:51.700 --> 36:57.700]  And there's like seven different agencies that want to come in and inspect your shit if you're growing and making concentrates.
[36:57.700 --> 37:00.700]  And then manufacturing concentrated marijuana.
[37:00.700 --> 37:02.700]  He was doing that at his house, open blasting.
[37:02.700 --> 37:05.700]  So I think that's where the change happens.
[37:05.700 --> 37:06.700]  Right?
[37:06.700 --> 37:07.700]  Yeah.
[37:07.700 --> 37:11.700]  So I guess the point is don't fucking blast indoors.
[37:11.700 --> 37:12.700]  Don't open blast.
[37:12.700 --> 37:14.700]  If you're going to blast, get a closed loop and you can still fuck up.
[37:14.700 --> 37:15.700]  Do that safely.
[37:15.700 --> 37:21.700]  There's yet to be a news story about someone hurting themselves making BHO outside.
[37:21.700 --> 37:25.700]  Those news stories don't happen because people don't get hurt that way.
[37:25.700 --> 37:26.700]  That's kind of a good point.
[37:26.700 --> 37:28.700]  Just take it to your backyard, numb nuts.
[37:28.700 --> 37:32.700]  Everyone I know that's never blown themselves up does it that way.
[37:32.700 --> 37:34.700]  Yeah.
[37:34.700 --> 37:38.700]  It's one of those things where it's not complicated.
[37:38.700 --> 37:41.700]  I was taught how to make my extracts outdoors.
[37:41.700 --> 37:46.700]  It's pretty much, I knew that already, but they're like, you always do this outside was the first thing they said.
[37:46.700 --> 37:48.700]  Step one, check the weather.
[37:48.700 --> 37:52.700]  I don't think there's any other news that we should talk about.
[37:52.700 --> 37:53.700]  Something's weird with this.
[37:53.700 --> 37:57.700]  Someone blew up a house with alcohol here in Pueblo the other day.
[37:57.700 --> 37:58.700]  Yeah.
[37:58.700 --> 38:01.700]  That's hilarious in a certain way.
[38:01.700 --> 38:02.700]  Yeah.
[38:02.700 --> 38:03.700]  In Pueblo.
[38:03.700 --> 38:07.700]  This is one of the largest alcohol.
[38:07.700 --> 38:09.700]  We were on one of the routes for the prohibition.
[38:09.700 --> 38:11.700]  This was a huge prohibition town.
[38:11.700 --> 38:17.700]  We have tunnels under this town where people used to move alcohol from private houses where it was made to clubs, downtown.
[38:17.700 --> 38:19.700]  It scares me to death.
[38:19.700 --> 38:20.700]  Why does it scare you, bro?
[38:20.700 --> 38:22.700]  My kids are going to grow up here.
[38:22.700 --> 38:23.700]  My kids are wild.
[38:23.700 --> 38:24.700]  They're going to find that shit.
[38:24.700 --> 38:25.700]  I would have found that shit.
[38:25.700 --> 38:26.700]  Oh, no.
[38:26.700 --> 38:29.700]  I would have found that shit real quick.
[38:29.700 --> 38:30.700]  They're not hidden, dude.
[38:30.700 --> 38:31.700]  I know they're not hidden.
[38:31.700 --> 38:32.700]  They're closed up now.
[38:32.700 --> 38:33.700]  Most of them are closed up.
[38:33.700 --> 38:34.700]  I lived in a house.
[38:34.700 --> 38:36.700]  Those are different tunnels.
[38:36.700 --> 38:38.700]  I lived in a house in an area.
[38:38.700 --> 38:40.700]  I don't even know if I should talk about this.
[38:40.700 --> 38:42.700]  There's a part of town called Goat Hill.
[38:42.700 --> 38:44.700]  Many years ago.
[38:44.700 --> 38:48.700]  I don't remember the exact year, so I don't want to be wrong and try to say I have an idea in my head.
[38:48.700 --> 38:52.700]  Many years ago, this town flooded up to the third story window of a lot of buildings downtown.
[38:52.700 --> 38:54.700]  1916, I think.
[38:54.700 --> 38:55.700]  It could have been.
[38:55.700 --> 38:56.700]  I'll agree with you.
[38:56.700 --> 38:57.700]  That way Jesse can be wrong and I won't.
[38:57.700 --> 38:59.700]  I was going to say 1929, but I really have no idea.
[38:59.700 --> 39:00.700]  A long time ago.
[39:01.700 --> 39:02.700]  When the pictures were yellow.
[39:02.700 --> 39:04.700]  When they took pictures, everything was yellow.
[39:04.700 --> 39:05.700]  1944.
[39:05.700 --> 39:06.700]  That's about it.
[39:06.700 --> 39:07.700]  It could have been.
[39:07.700 --> 39:08.700]  But this town flooded.
[39:08.700 --> 39:11.700]  There's a hill near, it used to be First Street.
[39:11.700 --> 39:14.700]  Now it's fucking Center City Drive or some dumb shit.
[39:14.700 --> 39:15.700]  City Center Drive.
[39:15.700 --> 39:16.700]  That's so dumb.
[39:16.700 --> 39:17.700]  It's First Street, bitches.
[39:17.700 --> 39:18.700]  Why'd you change that?
[39:18.700 --> 39:21.700]  So right up there, there was a hill, and it was called Goat Hill.
[39:21.700 --> 39:29.700]  And that's where allegedly all of the Italians that lived here went and moved to that top of the hill and took all their livestock there.
[39:29.700 --> 39:30.700]  And they had goats up there.
[39:30.700 --> 39:32.700]  And that part of town became known as Goat Hill.
[39:32.700 --> 39:37.700]  In my house, I had a hatch that lifted up in my bedroom.
[39:37.700 --> 39:41.700]  And you could lift up that and you'd end up in a hidden basement part.
[39:41.700 --> 39:44.700]  And then there was definitely a hole that had been bricked over.
[39:44.700 --> 39:48.700]  And I'm pretty sure that that hole was part of those tunnels.
[39:48.700 --> 39:55.700]  And then I was in a band that did a show at the Damon Runyon Theater downtown, which used to be the Chief.
[39:55.700 --> 39:59.700]  And if you go to one of the little back areas by the kitchen, there's a tunnel that's blocked off.
[39:59.700 --> 40:03.700]  And the security guard wouldn't let me go past that area because I was just in the opening band.
[40:03.700 --> 40:05.700]  And he's like, you can't go back here.
[40:05.700 --> 40:06.700]  I was like, I'm in the band.
[40:06.700 --> 40:07.700]  He's like, you can't go back here.
[40:07.700 --> 40:08.700]  Like, all right.
[40:08.700 --> 40:09.700]  I tried.
[40:09.700 --> 40:11.700]  So those tunnels used to be used.
[40:11.700 --> 40:14.700]  I bet that tunnel and the tunnel I found connect somewhere, somehow.
[40:14.700 --> 40:16.700]  Like probably this.
[40:16.700 --> 40:19.700]  And the hooch was made at the top of the hill up on Goat Hill.
[40:19.700 --> 40:22.700]  And then it was ran and money probably.
[40:22.700 --> 40:29.700]  If you want to know why Pueblo has people in it, you can watch two documentaries on Netflix.
[40:29.700 --> 40:32.700]  One of them is Prohibition and the other one is The Great Dust Bowl.
[40:32.700 --> 40:33.700]  Ken Burns is amazing.
[40:33.700 --> 40:35.700]  Ken Burns is the shit.
[40:35.700 --> 40:37.700]  I'm writing those down to watch them again.
[40:37.700 --> 40:40.700]  If you watch both of those, Pueblo makes perfect sense.
[40:40.700 --> 40:44.700]  There's a lot of stuff here where people that move here are like, what's with that?
[40:44.700 --> 40:47.700]  It's a question they ask a bunch their first year.
[40:47.700 --> 40:49.700]  And the answer is either Prohibition or The Dust Bowl.
[40:49.700 --> 40:51.700]  Yeah, this town is old school.
[40:51.700 --> 40:54.700]  This was a stop on the Santa Fe Trail.
[40:54.700 --> 40:56.700]  This used to be called Little Chicago.
[40:56.700 --> 41:02.700]  Three or four rivers meet here going all different directions between here and the county.
[41:02.700 --> 41:04.700]  Two major highways meet here now.
[41:04.700 --> 41:06.700]  So now we get a lot of weird shit here.
[41:06.700 --> 41:09.700]  We got Highway 50 going east and west all the way across the country.
[41:09.700 --> 41:14.700]  And I-25 goes north and south almost all the way up through Canada, I think.
[41:14.700 --> 41:15.700]  So, I don't know.
[41:15.700 --> 41:17.700]  It might stop somewhere.
[41:17.700 --> 41:18.700]  That's a lot of weird rambles.
[41:18.700 --> 41:20.700]  Take that shit to El Paso, Texas.
[41:20.700 --> 41:22.700]  What even got us on that weird rant?
[41:23.700 --> 41:24.700]  That's all right.
[41:24.700 --> 41:25.700]  Who knows?
[41:25.700 --> 41:26.700]  Dabs.
[41:26.700 --> 41:29.700]  This weird rant was brought to you by Dabs.
[41:29.700 --> 41:31.700]  Dabs, shout out to the Garden of Weeden.
[41:33.700 --> 41:35.700]  I love it when I see those little envelopes.
[41:35.700 --> 41:38.700]  My smile goes from big to just ridiculous.
[41:38.700 --> 41:40.700]  Oh, yeah, their new packaging is definitely stylish.
[41:40.700 --> 41:41.700]  I like it.
[41:41.700 --> 41:42.700]  I like it.
[41:42.700 --> 41:43.700]  You guys made me feel a lot better.
[41:43.700 --> 41:45.700]  Thanks for coming over and making me snap out of my funk.
[41:45.700 --> 41:46.700]  I've been moping around all day.
[41:46.700 --> 41:48.700]  I did get a little bit of work done.
[41:48.700 --> 41:51.700]  I've been talking about the black cherry chempheno hunt that I'm doing.
[41:51.700 --> 41:53.700]  I don't know how much I talk about it on the show.
[41:53.700 --> 42:00.700]  I sprouted 40 seeds and 35 of them made it to the flower room, which is actually pretty impressive.
[42:00.700 --> 42:06.700]  When that many of them make it all the way to flower, that means that there were five, like, maybe.
[42:06.700 --> 42:08.700]  I don't remember exactly, but some didn't germinate.
[42:08.700 --> 42:12.700]  Some were runts, and then some I just didn't feel like they were worth the space.
[42:12.700 --> 42:14.700]  So, 35 of them made it to flower.
[42:14.700 --> 42:19.700]  Today I moved 11 of them into another room because they are males.
[42:19.700 --> 42:23.700]  My goal is to find a purple male and a green male.
[42:23.700 --> 42:24.700]  Hopefully the light went off.
[42:24.700 --> 42:25.700]  I've got to go check that.
[42:25.700 --> 42:26.700]  It was supposed to go off at 9.
[42:26.700 --> 42:27.700]  They're in a new room that got started tonight.
[42:27.700 --> 42:28.700]  We'll see how that worked.
[42:28.700 --> 42:29.700]  Yeah.
[42:29.700 --> 42:34.700]  Hopefully I find a purple male and a green male, and hopefully I find a purple female and a green female.
[42:35.700 --> 42:44.700]  I'm going to collect pollen and cube things and see if I can't make F2s that come out consistently purple.
[42:44.700 --> 42:46.700]  I want to work them to F5, honestly.
[42:46.700 --> 42:51.700]  That sounds ridiculous, but I want to work them to F5 to where they're purple clones of each other when they come out.
[42:51.700 --> 42:53.700]  You know that problem we're having with that one?
[42:53.700 --> 42:55.700]  I want the same thing.
[42:55.700 --> 42:59.700]  So, if something ever happens, I can't get it back.
[42:59.700 --> 43:00.700]  That's what I want.
[43:00.700 --> 43:01.700]  I feel you, dude.
[43:01.700 --> 43:03.700]  Strong shit.
[43:03.700 --> 43:06.700]  I'm not sure what any of that meant, but that's why we bring out that shit.
[43:06.700 --> 43:07.700]  I know.
[43:07.700 --> 43:08.700]  That's why I just rant and raved.
[43:08.700 --> 43:09.700]  Nobody else did either.
[43:09.700 --> 43:10.700]  They're all like, what the hell did that mean?
[43:10.700 --> 43:12.700]  This rant has been brought to you by forced labor.
[43:12.700 --> 43:13.700]  I'm so used to it.
[43:13.700 --> 43:15.700]  I didn't know anything was strange for about 30 seconds.
[43:15.700 --> 43:17.700]  Mike's been immune to it now.
[43:17.700 --> 43:20.700]  We're working together, and he turns around and glares at me.
[43:20.700 --> 43:23.700]  30 seconds later, he turns around and glares again.
[43:23.700 --> 43:25.700]  You're like a black Larry Bird.
[43:25.700 --> 43:26.700]  Like a minute ago.
[43:26.700 --> 43:29.700]  I just kidded my basketball.
[43:29.700 --> 43:31.700]  I've got to be awesomely out of place.
[43:31.700 --> 43:32.700]  Sorry, Mike.
[43:32.700 --> 43:37.700]  I just threw my coconut water way across the room, perfectly into the trash can.
[43:37.700 --> 43:38.700]  Yeah.
[43:38.700 --> 43:39.700]  I don't resemble.
[43:39.700 --> 43:41.700]  Practice, practice.
[43:41.700 --> 43:42.700]  That was a three-pointer for sure.
[43:42.700 --> 43:43.700]  But Adam's an asshole.
[43:43.700 --> 43:45.700]  That's basically what that was coming from.
[43:45.700 --> 43:46.700]  I don't think you're an asshole.
[43:46.700 --> 43:52.700]  I love how spontaneous and untamed you are.
[43:52.700 --> 43:53.700]  Yeah.
[43:53.700 --> 43:54.700]  There's no filter.
[43:54.700 --> 43:55.700]  No, it's fun.
[43:55.700 --> 43:56.700]  There's no filter.
[43:56.700 --> 43:57.700]  It's fun.
[43:57.700 --> 44:01.700]  Give him a tape measure and a stack of aluminum framing studs and just let him go to work.
[44:01.700 --> 44:06.700]  I like taking him to a restaurant where there's more than five ingredients on something.
[44:06.700 --> 44:08.700]  So my hand doesn't work right anymore.
[44:08.700 --> 44:12.700]  Dude, they take me to fucking like Hotel de Jota, Mexico.
[44:12.700 --> 44:14.700]  And they take me in there like, what do you want?
[44:14.700 --> 44:15.700]  Everything's in Spanish.
[44:15.700 --> 44:16.700]  What the fuck?
[44:16.700 --> 44:17.700]  Tacos, I guess?
[44:17.700 --> 44:18.700]  Fucking dig it.
[44:18.700 --> 44:19.700]  Does that say hamburger?
[44:19.700 --> 44:20.700]  I'll take you, dude.
[44:20.700 --> 44:22.700]  You're not getting a hamburger here, man.
[44:22.700 --> 44:23.700]  Like, why not?
[44:23.700 --> 44:24.700]  Hey.
[44:24.700 --> 44:26.700]  We forget he's not from Pueblo.
[44:26.700 --> 44:28.700]  That's how quickly he's gotten into the group.
[44:28.700 --> 44:29.700]  Taco Bell is far.
[44:30.700 --> 44:31.700]  Can I get two?
[44:31.700 --> 44:33.700]  I told him all the other day.
[44:33.700 --> 44:37.700]  I told him all the other day, like, I'm screw McDonald's and all that.
[44:37.700 --> 44:39.700]  Like, we haven't ate it.
[44:39.700 --> 44:42.700]  You know, we get Subway every now and then, but just because it's right there.
[44:42.700 --> 44:45.700]  But, you know, you gotta have a little GMO in your life or else.
[44:45.700 --> 44:47.700]  A little bit of yoga mat bread.
[44:47.700 --> 44:52.700]  Oh, I guarantee you the food at the Mexican place is chock full of Cheetos, too.
[44:52.700 --> 44:54.700]  Yeah, but it's just a different kind.
[44:54.700 --> 44:57.700]  You don't get 80 cent tacos for...
[44:57.700 --> 44:58.700]  They weren't 80 cents.
[44:58.700 --> 44:59.700]  I'm going to tell you how much right now.
[44:59.700 --> 45:00.700]  They were.
[45:00.700 --> 45:01.700]  Where'd you take him?
[45:01.700 --> 45:02.700]  I know.
[45:02.700 --> 45:03.700]  They didn't speak English.
[45:03.700 --> 45:04.700]  Except the...
[45:04.700 --> 45:07.700]  The first time we ate fish went in there, dude.
[45:07.700 --> 45:09.700]  I'm not even the first one to go.
[45:09.700 --> 45:12.700]  I got three chicken tacos for three bucks.
[45:12.700 --> 45:13.700]  That was sick.
[45:13.700 --> 45:16.700]  Well, see, there's different kinds of Mexican food places in Pueblo.
[45:16.700 --> 45:17.700]  There's three taco stops on that street.
[45:17.700 --> 45:18.700]  No, I'm joking.
[45:18.700 --> 45:19.700]  I want good tacos.
[45:19.700 --> 45:26.700]  You've got, like, Pueblo style Mexican, which is like taco casa and taco stop and burritos,
[45:26.700 --> 45:29.700]  and that's where you get green chili and stuff like that.
[45:29.700 --> 45:32.700]  And then you've got, like, the actual Mexicano Mexican stuff.
[45:32.700 --> 45:33.700]  Street tacos.
[45:33.700 --> 45:34.700]  Street tacos.
[45:34.700 --> 45:35.700]  Yeah.
[45:35.700 --> 45:38.700]  And if you tell them you want green chili, you get green chilis diced.
[45:38.700 --> 45:41.700]  What about the guy that carries around the cooler and he goes, burritos?
[45:41.700 --> 45:43.700]  Some of those dudes are fucking awesome, too.
[45:43.700 --> 45:44.700]  Yeah.
[45:44.700 --> 45:47.700]  When I worked at Guitar Center, there was a little lady that used to come in all the time with the burritos.
[45:47.700 --> 45:48.700]  Everybody would buy those.
[45:48.700 --> 45:49.700]  I didn't buy them.
[45:49.700 --> 45:50.700]  I'm a vegetarian.
[45:50.700 --> 45:51.700]  I'm pretty strict about what I'll eat.
[45:51.700 --> 45:55.700]  But those guys would buy the burritos, and about 30 minutes later, they'd all have to go take a fat dump.
[45:55.700 --> 45:57.700]  You couldn't find any of them all the time.
[45:57.700 --> 45:58.700]  But they're like, they're so good.
[45:58.700 --> 46:00.700]  Yeah, but you're dying in there, fucker.
[46:00.700 --> 46:01.700]  I can tell.
[46:01.700 --> 46:02.700]  There's one chick and her son.
[46:02.700 --> 46:08.700]  Every time I see her, I'm like, I've been buying them since I worked construction 12 years ago.
[46:08.700 --> 46:10.700]  I'm like, yeah, what do you got?
[46:10.700 --> 46:13.700]  They always have a little fried stuffed sopa piece.
[46:13.700 --> 46:14.700]  Yeah.
[46:14.700 --> 46:15.700]  Awesome, dude.
[46:15.700 --> 46:16.700]  I think I know who you're talking about.
[46:16.700 --> 46:17.700]  They used to go to the Pixie.
[46:17.700 --> 46:19.700]  I used to be in the house band at the Pixie, and they'd show up.
[46:19.700 --> 46:20.700]  Her son always goes to the bar.
[46:20.700 --> 46:21.700]  Yeah, got the cooler.
[46:21.700 --> 46:23.700]  Still got this Kleenex in my nose, and it feels so weird.
[46:23.700 --> 46:24.700]  It's all soggy.
[46:24.700 --> 46:25.700]  I would have impressed it's still there.
[46:25.700 --> 46:27.700]  But it's so soggy, it's not going anywhere.
[46:27.700 --> 46:29.700]  Did it swell up?
[46:29.700 --> 46:30.700]  I think it did.
[46:30.700 --> 46:31.700]  It puffed up.
[46:31.700 --> 46:32.700]  Is it for a light day or a heavy day?
[46:32.700 --> 46:34.700]  It's for a medium flow.
[46:34.700 --> 46:37.700]  All right, so I'm doing that Black Cherry Phenol hunt.
[46:37.700 --> 46:40.700]  I've got five Black Cherries right now, too.
[46:40.700 --> 46:41.700]  Do you?
[46:41.700 --> 46:42.700]  Yeah.
[46:42.700 --> 46:44.700]  I'll tell you later.
[46:44.700 --> 46:47.700]  They're actually kind of old, especially for their size.
[46:47.700 --> 46:48.700]  Better get used to the Black Cherry shit.
[46:48.700 --> 46:49.700]  Yeah.
[46:49.700 --> 46:52.700]  The Nano Lux love is they're taking the fuck off.
[46:52.700 --> 46:53.700]  Oh, man.
[46:54.700 --> 46:57.700]  Guys, we're going to have a lot of cool prizes on episode 50.
[46:57.700 --> 46:58.700]  I'm excited about that.
[46:58.700 --> 47:02.700]  I was just listening to the banter that was happening on the show with four of us,
[47:02.700 --> 47:05.700]  and with six people happening, it's going to be a mess.
[47:05.700 --> 47:09.700]  We've got to come up with some contest if you guys have any ideas.
[47:09.700 --> 47:11.700]  Some contest?
[47:11.700 --> 47:14.700]  Yeah, a way to give away all the cool prizes that we've got.
[47:14.700 --> 47:15.700]  I think we've got a couple of cool ideas.
[47:15.700 --> 47:20.700]  We're going to number the prize packs so that this is like the biggest one will be number one,
[47:20.700 --> 47:22.700]  and we'll work our way down to the smaller prizes.
[47:22.700 --> 47:28.700]  We'll do some sort of contest, and whoever does better at the contest will win a place in the prizing.
[47:28.700 --> 47:32.700]  Maybe we'll let you ask for which prize you want so that you don't want a T-shirt,
[47:32.700 --> 47:35.700]  or you want a T-shirt and you win a fucking ballast.
[47:35.700 --> 47:39.700]  If you live in Florida and can't grow and all you wanted was an Irish shirt,
[47:39.700 --> 47:41.700]  and we send you something cool.
[47:41.700 --> 47:43.700]  Now you've got a $300 bulb.
[47:43.700 --> 47:45.700]  Yeah.
[47:45.700 --> 47:48.700]  We're going to try not to do that.
[47:49.700 --> 47:54.700]  Feed nutrients to the ornamental plants in the apartment complex.
[47:54.700 --> 47:58.700]  Boy, my azaleas really took off.
[47:58.700 --> 48:01.700]  Yeah, fed all that botanic care and grocashi to that stuff.
[48:01.700 --> 48:05.700]  So, yeah, we're definitely going to have to get together right before the show a little bit
[48:05.700 --> 48:07.700]  and talk about what we're giving away.
[48:07.700 --> 48:10.700]  I'd never win it, but if I wasn't one of the dudes at the table.
[48:10.700 --> 48:11.700]  You're not eligible.
[48:11.700 --> 48:17.700]  Yeah, I know, but I'm just saying, like, I'd never win it, but I'm telling you now, if I was, I'd try.
[48:17.700 --> 48:18.700]  That's good stuff.
[48:18.700 --> 48:20.700]  There's going to have to be some rules, huh?
[48:20.700 --> 48:22.700]  If you win on the show, then I guess you can't win.
[48:22.700 --> 48:24.700]  No, no, everybody should know that.
[48:24.700 --> 48:27.700]  I'm just sitting here thinking, there's some stuff in that box that I would fully be like, I'm sick.
[48:27.700 --> 48:31.700]  And I'd go home and play, like, create new username.
[48:31.700 --> 48:33.700]  I don't want to hear that, but.
[48:33.700 --> 48:36.700]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[48:36.700 --> 48:38.700]  That's awesome.
[48:38.700 --> 48:42.700]  I'm also doing a Lemon Jeffery cross to the Grateful Dog pheno hunt.
[48:42.700 --> 48:44.700]  Dude, those look amazing.
[48:44.700 --> 48:46.700]  Five of them in there, and they look fierce.
[48:46.700 --> 48:49.700]  There was two of us in the room that just went, oh.
[48:49.700 --> 48:51.700]  Yeah, yeah, that's a great plan.
[48:51.700 --> 48:54.700]  I've seen, I got somebody else growing it, and they're like, no, they're not growing that one.
[48:54.700 --> 48:55.700]  Yeah, they are.
[48:55.700 --> 48:57.700]  They're growing that one, and it looks amazing.
[48:57.700 --> 48:59.700]  So many projects, so few babies.
[48:59.700 --> 49:02.700]  I've sent so many seeds to so many people.
[49:02.700 --> 49:06.700]  Yeah, guys, I was promising more seeds to Nature's Green Remedies.
[49:06.700 --> 49:08.700]  I might have fucked up.
[49:08.700 --> 49:10.700]  I didn't make enough seeds.
[49:10.700 --> 49:11.700]  I seriously didn't make enough seeds.
[49:11.700 --> 49:20.700]  All my friends, all my locals are sucking up all the seeds that I made, and honestly, I'm going to get my crew around here seeds before I mail a lot of shit out to a distributor.
[49:20.700 --> 49:24.700]  It just seems, like, Grow From the Heart is my name of my show.
[49:24.700 --> 49:30.700]  It's been my motto for years, and I feel like my community is right here, and I don't need to go sending stuff out to somewhere else.
[49:30.700 --> 49:32.700]  It helps you produce a better product, too.
[49:32.700 --> 49:34.700]  It does, because I get to see clones.
[49:34.700 --> 49:35.700]  I get to go to these people's gardens.
[49:35.700 --> 49:37.700]  I get to see what's happening.
[49:37.700 --> 49:38.700]  Guys, you'll get seeds from me.
[49:38.700 --> 49:39.700]  I promise.
[49:39.700 --> 49:40.700]  I'm always making more.
[49:40.700 --> 49:41.700]  We're working on it.
[49:41.700 --> 49:42.700]  Yeah, Jesse's on the team now.
[49:42.700 --> 49:43.700]  He's making more.
[49:43.700 --> 49:46.700]  I've got breeding space somewhere else now.
[49:46.700 --> 49:48.700]  I promise I'm always making more.
[49:48.700 --> 49:49.700]  It's just hard to keep up, dude.
[49:49.700 --> 49:50.700]  You guys are hungry for the seeds.
[49:50.700 --> 49:52.700]  Thank you, and I apologize.
[49:52.700 --> 49:54.700]  It's a process.
[49:54.700 --> 49:55.700]  I'm doing what I can.
[49:55.700 --> 49:56.700]  Yeah.
[49:56.700 --> 49:57.700]  Yeah, it's hard to.
[49:57.700 --> 50:00.700]  I've been wanting seeds since I've been here, and I've just never had money at the time.
[50:00.700 --> 50:01.700]  He's like, look at all these seeds.
[50:01.700 --> 50:03.700]  Get a whole table full of seeds.
[50:03.700 --> 50:04.700]  He's like, so which ones do you want?
[50:04.700 --> 50:08.700]  I'm like, the ones that you're throwing away over there would be cool.
[50:09.700 --> 50:10.700]  The pale ones?
[50:10.700 --> 50:11.700]  The ruts, yeah.
[50:11.700 --> 50:12.700]  Maybe I'll get one of those to sprout.
[50:12.700 --> 50:15.700]  Timing everything is kind of a pain in the ass.
[50:15.700 --> 50:16.700]  We know how to do it.
[50:16.700 --> 50:20.700]  We've done it enough, but getting your males started, and then if I put three or four or
[50:20.700 --> 50:24.700]  four or five females in the room with that male, sometimes they have to go into flower
[50:24.700 --> 50:28.700]  four or five, six or seven, eight or ten days apart from each other to time up when the
[50:28.700 --> 50:31.700]  females are ovulating to take that pollen.
[50:31.700 --> 50:34.700]  For sure, and different males dump at different times.
[50:34.700 --> 50:37.700]  Honestly, what I did, I'll admit this.
[50:37.700 --> 50:42.700]  I make my own silver thiosulfate, and I tried a new method, and I over applied, and my male
[50:42.700 --> 50:47.700]  plants turned male super quick, quicker than I've ever seen, but at the same time, they
[50:47.700 --> 50:48.700]  didn't make any pollen.
[50:48.700 --> 50:53.700]  They made some, but not nearly as much as I had anticipated, not what I'm used to.
[50:53.700 --> 50:56.700]  I got about a quarter amount of the seeds I expected, to tell you the truth.
[50:56.700 --> 50:58.700]  I'm a man enough to say that on the show.
[50:58.700 --> 51:02.700]  I done fucked up, y'all, but I learned from it, and I know not to do that again.
[51:02.700 --> 51:06.700]  Real life mistakes, and that's a high level mistake too.
[51:06.700 --> 51:09.700]  If you're making that, don't.
[51:09.700 --> 51:12.700]  I don't think you're beating yourself up.
[51:12.700 --> 51:13.700]  No, I know not to do that.
[51:13.700 --> 51:14.700]  I over applied.
[51:14.700 --> 51:18.700]  I sprayed too many times, and I made it too strong and sprayed too many times.
[51:18.700 --> 51:20.700]  We're back to the number of sprays.
[51:20.700 --> 51:24.700]  I remember the issue you were going through and everything at the time.
[51:24.700 --> 51:28.700]  I solved that issue, and created a whole new mess of problems for myself doing it.
[51:28.700 --> 51:30.700]  Don't spray your hash with a torch.
[51:30.700 --> 51:32.700]  See, we're all learning shit.
[51:33.700 --> 51:36.700]  If you don't fuck up, you don't learn.
[51:36.700 --> 51:38.700]  I think I taught you that.
[51:38.700 --> 51:39.700]  I think I've said that.
[51:39.700 --> 51:40.700]  I don't know if I taught you that.
[51:40.700 --> 51:41.700]  Everybody's taught me that.
[51:41.700 --> 51:43.700]  Life has taught me that, trust me.
[51:43.700 --> 51:45.700]  I fucked up on a big scale.
[51:45.700 --> 51:47.700]  I was going big, and I ruined some shit by doing it.
[51:47.700 --> 51:48.700]  We all do.
[51:48.700 --> 51:49.700]  It made a lot of good hash.
[51:49.700 --> 51:50.700]  We learn.
[51:50.700 --> 51:54.700]  Those plants that did not get seeded made a hell of a lot of good hash, so that works.
[51:54.700 --> 51:56.700]  Oh, man.
[51:56.700 --> 51:57.700]  Hooray.
[51:57.700 --> 51:58.700]  Everybody, get your Cannabis Cup tickets.
[51:58.700 --> 52:00.700]  The Denver Cannabis Cup is coming.
[52:00.700 --> 52:01.700]  I am not endorsed by High Times.
[52:01.700 --> 52:02.700]  I'm not paid to say this.
[52:02.700 --> 52:04.700]  I just want to see you guys there.
[52:04.700 --> 52:08.700]  I will not have a booth, but I will be cruising around having fun, saying what's up to people.
[52:08.700 --> 52:10.700]  I plan on being there all three days, most likely.
[52:10.700 --> 52:13.700]  Should we all just rent a van and a house?
[52:13.700 --> 52:17.700]  A house would be cool, but no.
[52:17.700 --> 52:18.700]  I'm getting the—
[52:18.700 --> 52:19.700]  We're all meat eaters.
[52:19.700 --> 52:21.700]  He'll be like, you guys stink.
[52:21.700 --> 52:23.700]  I know a whole bunch of us that want to go.
[52:23.700 --> 52:25.700]  Yeah, well, I've got my tickets.
[52:25.700 --> 52:27.700]  I may be into that option.
[52:27.700 --> 52:28.700]  Cheap people for life.
[52:28.700 --> 52:30.700]  I think I want to go to a motel with my wife.
[52:30.700 --> 52:31.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[52:31.700 --> 52:32.700]  I got family over there.
[52:32.700 --> 52:33.700]  You fucking stone fellas.
[52:33.700 --> 52:34.700]  Right, yeah.
[52:34.700 --> 52:35.700]  I'll hump on the couch.
[52:35.700 --> 52:36.700]  I don't care.
[52:36.700 --> 52:37.700]  I usually do a pretty good hotel for those kind of events.
[52:37.700 --> 52:40.700]  If I'm there for three days, I want some luxury.
[52:40.700 --> 52:41.700]  You know how we do it.
[52:41.700 --> 52:42.700]  I know.
[52:42.700 --> 52:46.700]  Somewhere with a balcony, so we can open that balcony door there, the sliding glass door,
[52:46.700 --> 52:47.700]  and chill out.
[52:47.700 --> 52:48.700]  Sucks.
[52:48.700 --> 52:51.700]  This sounds like I'm going to be working a booth for someone, so.
[52:51.700 --> 52:52.700]  Yeah?
[52:52.700 --> 52:53.700]  Yeah.
[52:53.700 --> 52:54.700]  Oh, I think I know who you're working with.
[52:54.700 --> 52:55.700]  Yeah.
[52:55.700 --> 52:56.700]  Yeah, let me know about that.
[52:56.700 --> 52:59.700]  I could use some wristbands.
[53:00.700 --> 53:02.700]  I heard something about that.
[53:02.700 --> 53:04.700]  I was just thinking the same thing, boss.
[53:04.700 --> 53:06.700]  Do what I can.
[53:06.700 --> 53:12.700]  I do have wristbands that we'll be able to trade out for another event, so.
[53:12.700 --> 53:16.700]  And I think you'll be very interested in it.
[53:16.700 --> 53:19.700]  It's before the Cannabis Cup.
[53:19.700 --> 53:21.700]  Before the Cannabis Cup.
[53:21.700 --> 53:22.700]  There's something coming up.
[53:22.700 --> 53:23.700]  Do I need to grow a fat crop for something?
[53:23.700 --> 53:24.700]  No, no, no.
[53:24.700 --> 53:25.700]  Okay.
[53:25.700 --> 53:26.700]  Before April?
[53:26.700 --> 53:28.700]  It's an accessories event, so.
[53:28.700 --> 53:29.700]  Oh, cool.
[53:29.700 --> 53:30.700]  Yeah.
[53:30.700 --> 53:31.700]  Oh, yeah.
[53:31.700 --> 53:33.700]  Everyone's going, huh, over here.
[53:33.700 --> 53:34.700]  All right.
[53:34.700 --> 53:36.700]  So, you know, hire employees only.
[53:36.700 --> 53:39.700]  Get your Cannabis Cup ticket so that we can all hang out and have fun there.
[53:39.700 --> 53:41.700]  Don't be a mooch like I'm really at this table.
[53:41.700 --> 53:43.700]  Don't try to suck up wristbands from the vendors.
[53:43.700 --> 53:45.700]  Go to MedCannCup.com.
[53:45.700 --> 53:51.700]  The tickets right now, what I bought was a three-day early bird special for like 85 bucks
[53:51.700 --> 53:57.700]  plus a $5.50 service fucking stick-it-in-your-butt fee.
[53:57.700 --> 54:01.700]  It does not include any concert tickets because I actually plan on seeing Doug Benson.
[54:01.700 --> 54:07.700]  I've got a ticket to see Doug Benson on 420 at Comedy Works at 9 o'clock.
[54:07.700 --> 54:10.700]  So, I'm not going to the Snoop Dogg concert and stuff.
[54:10.700 --> 54:14.700]  I know that sounds weak, but Doug Benson is actually a friend of mine, and it's a comedy taping.
[54:14.700 --> 54:20.700]  One of my favorite comedians taping their new comedy special at my favorite comedy club in the country.
[54:20.700 --> 54:21.700]  On our holiday.
[54:21.700 --> 54:23.700]  On 420 with Doug Benson.
[54:23.700 --> 54:28.700]  I would say that, I'm sorry, the High Times concerts aren't that cool.
[54:28.700 --> 54:30.700]  They're just not.
[54:30.700 --> 54:34.700]  You kind of reach an age where a concert is just like, it's great.
[54:34.700 --> 54:35.700]  You love to see dance.
[54:35.700 --> 54:39.700]  They're outdoors in April in Colorado, and you don't know what you're getting into.
[54:39.700 --> 54:41.700]  I take shorts and a parka.
[54:41.700 --> 54:42.700]  Yeah, exactly.
[54:42.700 --> 54:43.700]  We saw slightly.
[54:43.700 --> 54:45.700]  You wear shorts all day because at the cup it's nice.
[54:45.700 --> 54:46.700]  You know what I mean?
[54:46.700 --> 54:49.700]  You're rocking shorts and a t-shirt, and then you get in the car and you go eat dinner,
[54:49.700 --> 54:53.700]  and you go to the hotel and you got to change into pants and long sleeves and a hoodie,
[54:53.700 --> 54:57.700]  and put some Chapstick on your lips, because we went out to Red Rocks for Slightly Stupid.
[54:57.700 --> 54:58.700]  I'm not dissing the shows, guys.
[54:58.700 --> 55:00.700]  We went out to Red Rocks, and it was so windy.
[55:00.700 --> 55:04.700]  Go see Slightly Stupid at Red Rocks, just not on 420.
[55:04.700 --> 55:05.700]  Yeah.
[55:05.700 --> 55:06.700]  That's for sure.
[55:06.700 --> 55:08.700]  I've never heard anyone say, don't.
[55:08.700 --> 55:10.700]  Yeah, I wouldn't go see them at Red Rocks.
[55:10.700 --> 55:13.700]  Anytime anybody's seen anybody at Red Rocks.
[55:13.700 --> 55:14.700]  Oh, yeah.
[55:14.700 --> 55:18.700]  January 30th at Red Rocks is Damian Marley and a couple of other bands.
[55:18.700 --> 55:19.700]  Yeah.
[55:19.700 --> 55:20.700]  Man.
[55:20.700 --> 55:21.700]  People are going to freeze their dicks off out there.
[55:21.700 --> 55:22.700]  Seriously?
[55:22.700 --> 55:24.700]  Damn, I thought they shut that bitch down.
[55:24.700 --> 55:25.700]  No, they're just doing shows out there.
[55:25.700 --> 55:27.700]  January 30th at Red Rocks.
[55:27.700 --> 55:28.700]  Right.
[55:28.700 --> 55:29.700]  Damian and someone else.
[55:29.700 --> 55:30.700]  Yeah.
[55:30.700 --> 55:31.700]  And Damian's from Jamaica.
[55:31.700 --> 55:32.700]  He's going to freeze.
[55:32.700 --> 55:34.700]  Maybe out there in a parka and shit.
[55:34.700 --> 55:35.700]  Some sort of evil joke.
[55:35.700 --> 55:39.700]  I just had a whole bunch of cool running moments flash through my head.
[55:39.700 --> 55:43.700]  That's probably coinciding with that X Games shit or something else going on.
[55:43.700 --> 55:44.700]  You know what I mean?
[55:44.700 --> 55:47.700]  I don't know for sure, but I would just assume, since that's the way events like to do it.
[55:47.700 --> 55:49.700]  They piggyback on each other just to make money.
[55:49.700 --> 55:51.700]  And they make it seem like it's just a nice casual trip.
[55:51.700 --> 55:53.700]  Probably get a heated stage by now.
[55:53.700 --> 55:55.700]  A heated stage.
[55:55.700 --> 55:57.700]  Dude, Red Rocks is treacherous.
[55:57.700 --> 55:58.700]  Yeah.
[55:58.700 --> 56:04.700]  Could you imagine all the fucking ice demelting shit they're going to have to spray all over that parka?
[56:04.700 --> 56:06.700]  The entire concrete surface?
[56:06.700 --> 56:07.700]  And the muddy parking lot?
[56:07.700 --> 56:10.700]  One slip at the top and it all the way up the fucking bottom.
[56:10.700 --> 56:11.700]  Dominoes.
[56:11.700 --> 56:16.700]  I think I'm going to see Ari Shaffir at Comedy Works on that day, on the 30th.
[56:16.700 --> 56:17.700]  January 30th, I think.
[56:17.700 --> 56:19.700]  I haven't talked to my buddy about that.
[56:19.700 --> 56:23.700]  He's working nights now, and I'm on this weird random podcast life schedule.
[56:23.700 --> 56:25.700]  So I might be going to that.
[56:25.700 --> 56:26.700]  What's up, bro?
[56:26.700 --> 56:27.700]  If you're listening to this, message me.
[56:27.700 --> 56:29.700]  We'll see if we're doing that.
[56:29.700 --> 56:31.700]  We'll see if there's room for one more in the car or whatever.
[56:31.700 --> 56:33.700]  Yeah.
[56:33.700 --> 56:35.700]  If not, that's cool.
[56:35.700 --> 56:37.700]  I didn't have anything going on at the time.
[56:37.700 --> 56:38.700]  But yeah, for sure.
[56:39.700 --> 56:42.700]  I just told him the other day that he should come with us to Doug Benson.
[56:42.700 --> 56:45.700]  But he's like, I don't know.
[56:45.700 --> 56:46.700]  It's cool.
[56:46.700 --> 56:50.700]  He's got his wife there, spending the weekend and shit.
[56:50.700 --> 56:51.700]  That would be cool.
[56:51.700 --> 56:55.700]  But no, she can stay at home with the kids.
[56:55.700 --> 56:57.700]  I'm talking about my wife, not yours.
[56:57.700 --> 56:58.700]  My wife.
[56:58.700 --> 56:59.700]  My wife.
[56:59.700 --> 57:01.700]  Totally lost my train of thought with that earlier.
[57:01.700 --> 57:06.700]  I was trying to talk to somebody about something, and I was like, as soon as I said it, it stopped.
[57:07.700 --> 57:08.700]  I'm sorry.
[57:08.700 --> 57:09.700]  I had to say it before.
[57:09.700 --> 57:11.700]  I was like, all right, now where was I?
[57:11.700 --> 57:12.700]  It was good.
[57:12.700 --> 57:13.700]  Yeah.
[57:13.700 --> 57:14.700]  People with ADD.
[57:14.700 --> 57:15.700]  Anybody got any plugs to do?
[57:15.700 --> 57:16.700]  Any shout-outs or anything?
[57:16.700 --> 57:17.700]  Dude.
[57:17.700 --> 57:18.700]  Shout-out to nap time.
[57:18.700 --> 57:19.700]  Shout-out to nap time.
[57:19.700 --> 57:20.700]  That's funny.
[57:20.700 --> 57:22.700]  Shout-out to my whole crew.
[57:22.700 --> 57:23.700]  You guys have been killing it.
[57:23.700 --> 57:24.700]  Nice.
[57:24.700 --> 57:28.700]  I haven't been present on the job site for a few days for some family reasons.
[57:28.700 --> 57:29.700]  Yeah.
[57:29.700 --> 57:33.700]  They've just been slaying it for me and taking care of business.
[57:33.700 --> 57:34.700]  Nice.
[57:34.700 --> 57:36.700]  We wish you the best on the family things.
[57:36.700 --> 57:37.700]  For sure.
[57:37.700 --> 57:38.700]  Yeah.
[57:38.700 --> 57:39.700]  All those fucks there.
[57:39.700 --> 57:40.700]  For sure.
[57:40.700 --> 57:41.700]  And Maddie's.
[57:41.700 --> 57:44.700]  Maddie's been killing it at the store for us, filling in there too.
[57:44.700 --> 57:45.700]  It's good to hear.
[57:45.700 --> 57:47.700]  Thank you very much, Maddie.
[57:47.700 --> 57:50.700]  Also killing it, slaying it.
[57:50.700 --> 57:51.700]  Slaying it.
[57:51.700 --> 57:52.700]  Slaying it.
[57:52.700 --> 57:53.700]  That girl can grow some weed, bro.
[57:53.700 --> 57:54.700]  Yeah.
[57:54.700 --> 57:55.700]  Hustling, hustling.
[57:55.700 --> 57:57.700]  I'm trying not to sneeze right at the show closing.
[57:57.700 --> 58:01.700]  I made it almost all the way through the show, and I'm getting that watery eye thing like I'm about to sneeze.
[58:02.700 --> 58:03.700]  Oh, man.
[58:03.700 --> 58:06.700]  Yeah, I'm totally going to sneeze, but I want to give a shout out to my girl, Angela.
[58:06.700 --> 58:07.700]  What's up, babe?
[58:07.700 --> 58:14.700]  I want to give a shout out to the Spot Dispensary, all the sponsors that have sponsored the show, and Task, and the Mystic Roots,
[58:14.700 --> 58:16.700]  Task Rock, and the Mystic Roots Band separately.
[58:16.700 --> 58:19.700]  That's not Task and the Mystic Roots Band, which would be fucking cool.
[58:19.700 --> 58:21.700]  That would be funny.
[58:21.700 --> 58:23.700]  But yeah, I'm going to read this.
[58:23.700 --> 58:24.700]  Try not to sneeze.
[58:24.700 --> 58:26.700]  Now that the show's over, please go to iTunes or Stitcher.
[58:26.700 --> 58:31.700]  Go to the iTunes store or the Stitcher main page and search for iGrowCulture slash Grow From Your Heart.
[58:31.700 --> 58:32.700]  Find the review section.
[58:32.700 --> 58:33.700]  Give us a five-star rating.
[58:33.700 --> 58:38.700]  After that, type in a comment and let me know what you think of the show, and I will read your comments on an upcoming show.
[58:38.700 --> 58:40.700]  Maybe I'll even read your comment on episode number 50.
[58:40.700 --> 58:41.700]  You never know.
[58:41.700 --> 58:47.700]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher, and every episode is archived on iReadGeneticsColorado.com.

[58:51.700 --> 58:53.700]  Please follow iReadGenetics on Instagram.
[58:53.700 --> 58:57.700]  I post so many sweet, sweet cannabis pictures on there.
[58:57.700 --> 58:58.700]  You've got to check that out.
[58:58.700 --> 58:59.700]  Fuck yeah.
[58:59.700 --> 59:01.700]  Don't forget we're in the process of changing the name.
[59:01.700 --> 59:02.700]  It was iGrowCulture.
[59:02.700 --> 59:05.700]  I'm trying to work on making it Grow From Your Heart.
[59:05.700 --> 59:07.700]  I need the logo fixed.
[59:07.700 --> 59:10.700]  Somebody sent me a logo, but it needed some corrections, and I haven't heard from them.
[59:10.700 --> 59:11.700]  Where are you, my Aussie friend?
[59:11.700 --> 59:13.700]  I hope you're listening down under.
[59:13.700 --> 59:14.700]  He's so busy right now.
[59:14.700 --> 59:15.700]  Okay, that's cool.
[59:15.700 --> 59:16.700]  Just like us.
[59:16.700 --> 59:17.700]  It's understandable.
[59:17.700 --> 59:20.700]  He just got some free time, and he said –
[59:21.700 --> 59:24.700]  I literally just hopped on the other night and was like,
[59:24.700 --> 59:27.700]  Hey, man, I haven't talked to you about this, but what about that logo?
[59:27.700 --> 59:29.700]  He's like, Trust me.
[59:29.700 --> 59:30.700]  I know.
[59:30.700 --> 59:31.700]  I'm like, All right.
[59:31.700 --> 59:32.700]  Okay.
[59:32.700 --> 59:37.700]  Dude, he's got to fight off crocodiles and kangaroos on a daily basis.
[59:37.700 --> 59:38.700]  I swear to God.
[59:38.700 --> 59:41.700]  He's like, Do you hear those fucking kookaburras?
[59:41.700 --> 59:42.700]  I'm like, Where are they?
[59:42.700 --> 59:44.700]  He's like, They're fucking everywhere.
[59:44.700 --> 59:45.700]  I was like, Get out of the garage.
[59:45.700 --> 59:46.700]  Go in the house.
[59:46.700 --> 59:47.700]  He's like, No.
[59:47.700 --> 59:48.700]  Oh, he's one of those guys.
[59:48.700 --> 59:51.700]  He was in the garage kind of guy, computer guy in the garage.
[59:51.700 --> 59:53.700]  He just built a picture in my head.
[59:53.700 --> 59:54.700]  You got to make do, man.
[59:54.700 --> 59:55.700]  You got to make do.
[59:55.700 --> 59:56.700]  You got to make do.
[59:56.700 --> 59:57.700]  All right.
[59:57.700 --> 59:59.700]  Don't forget we're changing the name, Don't Lose Us.
[59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.700]  It's a transition that will happen slowly.
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:02.700]  I'm struggling with it.
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.700]  You're struggling?
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.700]  Each time you've said it today, I'm like, Oh, yeah?
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.700]  Yeah, that's a new name of the show.
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.700]  You got to get new stickers.
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.700]  You got to get new everything.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.700]  Do everything.
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.700]  If you guys are interested in sponsoring the podcast
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.700]  or if you have a product you'd like me to review,
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:18.700]  send me an email at growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:20.700]  and I will get you all the info you need.
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.700]  I want to give a huge shout out to these boys for showing up today
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:23.700]  and making a great podcast.
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.700]  We didn't do any preparations and we slayed this show, bro.
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:27.700]  Slayed it.
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:28.700]  Awesome.
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.700]  Rawr.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:30.700]  We crushed it.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:31.700]  We totally like narded up and shit.
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:32.700]  It happened.
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:35.700]  There's some snowboarder talk a little bit.
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.700]  I guess so.
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.700]  Wicked gnarly, bro.
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:39.700]  Hitting some pow pow.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.700]  We're just going to end this before this gets out of control.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.700]  I want to give a big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:45.700]  Thanks again for listening.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:49.700]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.700]  We'll be right back.
