[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  Here we go.
[00:01.000 --> 00:02.680]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[00:02.680 --> 00:07.100]  It is time for episode 482 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.100 --> 00:11.100]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Hear Now.
[00:11.100 --> 00:16.040]  If you need new regular, feminized, or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds
[00:16.040 --> 00:24.160]  Hear Now, and you can find them at www.seedshearnow.com.
[00:24.160 --> 00:27.640]  I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:27.640 --> 00:32.780]  Today I've been taking dabs of Curacao Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[00:32.780 --> 00:35.800]  This is a blend of coin style and dehesion punch.
[00:35.800 --> 00:40.100]  On the package, the flavor is described as vanilla fruit chew.
[00:40.100 --> 00:44.120]  I may have talked about this concentrate on the podcast before, but I really like dabbing
[00:44.120 --> 00:46.040]  the Curacao Live Batter.
[00:46.040 --> 00:48.440]  It does say that it tastes like a vanilla fruit chew.
[00:48.440 --> 00:50.920]  I don't remember the description I gave last time.
[00:50.920 --> 00:55.760]  I do know that I just took a nice low temp dab out of a freshly cleaned rig with a fresh
[00:55.880 --> 01:00.120]  brand new nail, and it tastes a little bit like a candy corn.
[01:00.120 --> 01:03.440]  People are going to say that's gross because I don't like candy corns, but imagine if you
[01:03.440 --> 01:08.040]  could eat a candy corn and not have to taste that waxy bullshit that comes with it.
[01:08.040 --> 01:11.520]  Without that waxy shit, I think a candy corn would taste really delicious.
[01:11.520 --> 01:13.340]  It's got that vanilla candy flavor.
[01:13.340 --> 01:15.480]  It's got a hint of a fruity flavor at the end.
[01:15.480 --> 01:21.040]  This Curacao Live Batter left a really nice, sweet vanilla flavor on my tongue, and I am
[01:21.040 --> 01:23.280]  absolutely enjoying it.
[01:23.280 --> 01:28.800]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the perfect Curacao Live Batter.
[01:28.800 --> 01:33.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, in this episode,
[01:33.040 --> 01:35.960]  I am going to do a little talk about defoliation.
[01:35.960 --> 01:37.880]  We will talk about why I do it.
[01:37.880 --> 01:41.360]  We will talk about when to do it, and we will talk a little bit about how to do it.
[01:41.360 --> 01:46.360]  But before we get there, let's do some shout outs to our friends who support the show on

[02:42.200 --> 02:45.920]  Now let's jump right into talking about defoliation.
[02:45.920 --> 02:53.120]  I get a lot of questions asking about how and why and when to defoliate our ganja plants.
[02:53.120 --> 02:58.440]  A lot of growers have a lot of opinions on defoliating cannabis plants.
[02:58.440 --> 03:04.680]  In this episode, I will tell you when and how to properly defoliate your cannabis plants.
[03:04.680 --> 03:11.400]  Before I do that part, let me explain to you why I feel like defoliation is a good idea.
[03:11.400 --> 03:15.600]  Maybe I should start by basically explaining what do I mean by defoliating.
[03:15.600 --> 03:19.600]  I mean taking off excessive leaves in your grow room.
[03:19.600 --> 03:24.200]  Any leaves that are too large, that are blocking light, that may become a problem in the future,
[03:24.200 --> 03:29.560]  I take those leaves off early in flower, if not late into the vegetative cycle.
[03:29.560 --> 03:31.480]  And I do this for several reasons.
[03:31.480 --> 03:37.880]  My first reason is to allow light to penetrate my canopy and get to potential bud sites and
[03:37.880 --> 03:41.120]  bud sites for better growth and bud development.
[03:41.120 --> 03:45.300]  Our main goal is to grow big, potent, quality buds.
[03:45.300 --> 03:49.220]  If we can remove some leaf and put some of the light on more of the buds, spend more
[03:49.220 --> 03:53.540]  of the energy on growing buds and less energy on growing leaf, we have the potential to
[03:53.540 --> 03:58.460]  increase the overall harvest weight and the overall quality of our product.
[03:58.460 --> 04:03.820]  So I like to take off excess leaf to get more light into the canopy, more light to the buds
[04:03.820 --> 04:06.180]  and potential bud sites.
[04:06.180 --> 04:11.180]  I also like to remove excess leaf to allow more airflow.
[04:11.180 --> 04:14.620]  I work in large scale commercial environments.
[04:14.620 --> 04:19.620]  Airflow is important on any size of scale you are growing, but it gets much more critical
[04:19.620 --> 04:24.300]  as we get into larger environments and larger rooms and larger buildings.
[04:24.300 --> 04:28.700]  By removing excessive foliage, we can create better airflow throughout the entire grow
[04:28.700 --> 04:29.980]  room.
[04:29.980 --> 04:33.860]  Creating better airflow through the environment will have several advantages.
[04:33.860 --> 04:37.420]  This will help us regulate humidity in the grow room.
[04:37.420 --> 04:41.700]  Being able to regulate humidity in the grow room will help us prevent issues like bud
[04:41.700 --> 04:42.700]  rot.
[04:42.700 --> 04:46.100]  It will also help us prevent issues like powdery mildew.
[04:46.100 --> 04:49.500]  So by removing excess leaf, we help to reduce humidity.
[04:49.500 --> 04:53.860]  We also have less opportunity for things like powdery mildew.
[04:53.860 --> 04:57.340]  We also give ourselves less opportunity for bud rot.
[04:57.340 --> 05:03.060]  Now when we remove all those excess leaves, we also give ourselves less opportunity for
[05:03.060 --> 05:04.060]  pests.
[05:04.060 --> 05:08.020]  If you don't have a bunch of leaves, if you don't have a bunch of excessive foliage, there
[05:08.020 --> 05:11.220]  are less places for bugs to hide.
[05:11.220 --> 05:15.060]  It makes it much easier to treat for pests if you do have a problem.
[05:15.060 --> 05:19.780]  It makes it much easier to spray preventative sprays to make sure you don't get a problem.
[05:19.780 --> 05:24.380]  And when you're defoliating, if you do have a problem, you will absolutely notice a pest
[05:24.380 --> 05:28.300]  infestation while you're doing the defoliation work.
[05:28.300 --> 05:34.300]  Now those are three basic obvious advantages of defoliating our cannabis plants.
[05:34.300 --> 05:38.540]  And like I've said before, this becomes more necessary as we increase the size of our grow
[05:38.540 --> 05:41.060]  spaces and the number of plants.
[05:41.060 --> 05:47.580]  I also think that strategic defoliation will heavily increase the productivity of the plants
[05:47.580 --> 05:52.700]  and will also increase the overall product harvest weight and potency.
[05:52.700 --> 05:54.820]  So there will be several advantages here.
[05:54.820 --> 05:58.180]  It will also make trimming much easier.
[05:58.180 --> 05:59.460]  This will speed up the trim crew.
[05:59.460 --> 06:03.660]  Yes, we did spend a few days in the grow peeling off leaves before the trim crew ever got to
[06:03.660 --> 06:05.300]  it, but this will speed them up.
[06:05.300 --> 06:10.180]  That is that many less leaves that make it to the harvest phase.
[06:10.300 --> 06:11.940]  So that is why I defoliate.
[06:11.940 --> 06:17.180]  Now a lot of people have this mentality that the leaves are what hold the nutrients.
[06:17.180 --> 06:19.820]  Bro, we feed the shit out of these plants.
[06:19.820 --> 06:22.020]  We are spending a lot of money on nutrients.
[06:22.020 --> 06:24.020]  We are feeding high quality nutrients.
[06:24.020 --> 06:28.780]  We're mixing up high quality soils and soilless mixes, and we're feeding that to our plants.
[06:28.780 --> 06:30.100]  They're getting fed plenty.
[06:30.100 --> 06:32.020]  They're not out in the wilderness trying to survive.
[06:32.020 --> 06:33.020]  They're not homeless.
[06:33.020 --> 06:34.020]  They're getting taken care of.
[06:34.020 --> 06:36.260]  They don't need those excessive leaves.
[06:36.260 --> 06:38.180]  You know what is going to eat from those leaves?
[06:38.180 --> 06:39.180]  Spider mites.
[06:39.180 --> 06:40.180]  That's who's going to live there.
[06:40.180 --> 06:41.900]  That's who's going to feed off of that shit.
[06:41.900 --> 06:42.900]  So let's get rid of that.
[06:42.900 --> 06:44.060]  Let's help ourselves out.
[06:44.060 --> 06:45.420]  I've said it in a previous episode.
[06:45.420 --> 06:46.820]  I'm going to keep saying it.
[06:46.820 --> 06:49.900]  Let's set ourselves up for success.
[06:49.900 --> 06:56.380]  So again, in my opinion, proper strategic defoliation can have many great benefits.
[06:56.380 --> 07:00.940]  Now let's move toward talking about how I do my defoliation.
[07:00.940 --> 07:07.980]  There are a couple of very important steps to preparing for a proper defoliation session.
[07:07.980 --> 07:11.300]  One requirement is good music.
[07:11.300 --> 07:14.860]  You need proper music for a proper defoliation session.
[07:14.860 --> 07:17.660]  In a commercial environment, you can get tunnel vision.
[07:17.660 --> 07:22.980]  You've got a large room and very long rows that I tell four or five guys, hey, your whole
[07:22.980 --> 07:25.900]  goal for today is to defoliate this room.
[07:25.900 --> 07:27.940]  Give it like a level three defoliation.
[07:27.940 --> 07:28.940]  Don't strip it.
[07:28.940 --> 07:31.380]  Don't be a pussy, but get in there and pull off a bunch of leaves.
[07:31.380 --> 07:34.460]  I want a bunch of five gallon buckets worth of leaves coming out of here.
[07:34.460 --> 07:36.060]  Get in there and defoliate.
[07:36.060 --> 07:38.660]  What will happen is the guys will take a little break.
[07:38.660 --> 07:40.060]  That's another one of the requirements.
[07:40.060 --> 07:46.340]  If it is acceptable for you to medicate, you've got to get baked before you defoliate.
[07:46.340 --> 07:50.060]  So if that's your thing, get plenty baked, then put on good music.
[07:50.060 --> 07:52.780]  Then the next thing that I'm going to say you need is gloves.
[07:52.780 --> 07:55.440]  If you're defoliating, take me seriously on this one.
[07:55.440 --> 07:58.940]  You always need gloves when you are defoliating plants.
[07:58.940 --> 08:00.340]  But let's get back to this music part.
[08:00.340 --> 08:02.300]  Why do I want people to have good music on?
[08:02.620 --> 08:06.900]  The guys in the big grow tend to get a little bit of tunnel vision, and they will work on
[08:06.900 --> 08:11.820]  one area of the grow room really heavily, and they will forget to move to the next table.
[08:11.820 --> 08:13.660]  So you'll have 20 tables in the room.
[08:13.660 --> 08:17.340]  Two of them will be very well defoliated.
[08:17.340 --> 08:19.020]  The other 18 need a lot of work.
[08:19.020 --> 08:20.020]  They got ignored.
[08:20.020 --> 08:21.020]  They forgot they were there.
[08:21.020 --> 08:22.660]  So I tell the guys, put on a song.
[08:22.660 --> 08:24.260]  If you're going to put in earbuds, do that.
[08:24.260 --> 08:28.180]  If you're going to put on the big Bluetooth speaker that everybody can hear, do that.
[08:28.180 --> 08:29.500]  But put on some music.
[08:29.500 --> 08:30.500]  Put on some regular music.
[08:30.500 --> 08:33.380]  Don't listen to Fish or the Grateful Dead because this technique won't work with Fish
[08:33.380 --> 08:34.380]  or the Grateful Dead.
[08:34.380 --> 08:36.060]  Their songs are way too long.
[08:36.060 --> 08:39.780]  Put on your Pandora or whatever you're playing today, and just let it play.
[08:39.780 --> 08:43.860]  And at the end of each song, move down a few feet or move down to the next table.
[08:43.860 --> 08:47.320]  Just know that by the end of the day, you've got to get this whole room done, and don't
[08:47.320 --> 08:48.960]  get too stuck on one table.
[08:48.960 --> 08:52.360]  That's why I tell the guys, put on music and then move after each song.
[08:52.360 --> 08:56.420]  Just go to another section, move down, move six feet, move to another table.
[08:56.420 --> 08:58.500]  Just make progress every song.
[08:58.500 --> 09:03.580]  Now the reason I tell them to do that is because I don't want them to strip one section
[09:03.580 --> 09:08.100]  really heavily, and then we have to come back tomorrow and strip a couple more sections
[09:08.100 --> 09:09.140]  really heavily.
[09:09.140 --> 09:13.900]  I would rather them strip the entire room really lightly, and then we'll come back in
[09:13.900 --> 09:17.660]  a few days and we'll do the entire room really lightly.
[09:17.660 --> 09:21.560]  That way I don't have, like I keep saying, section one, tables one, two, and three are
[09:21.560 --> 09:22.560]  butt naked.
[09:22.560 --> 09:27.340]  There's no leaves over here, but tables four through 20 are coated in leaves still, and
[09:27.340 --> 09:28.340]  it's all furry.
[09:28.340 --> 09:29.340]  We're going to have different humidity.
[09:29.340 --> 09:30.940]  We're going to have problems in the room.
[09:30.940 --> 09:31.940]  Things are not consistent.
[09:31.940 --> 09:33.220]  I like consistency.
[09:33.220 --> 09:34.980]  I like uniformity in the grow.
[09:34.980 --> 09:35.980]  It makes things easy.
[09:35.980 --> 09:39.780]  So I tell the guys, go through and give it all a level one strip.
[09:39.780 --> 09:42.900]  Most of the time, the guys nail it because they know what I expect from them by now.
[09:42.900 --> 09:46.120]  They've been trained pretty well, but they usually go through and they give it a nice
[09:46.120 --> 09:47.120]  little strip.
[09:47.120 --> 09:48.740]  They don't strip them to where they're naked.
[09:48.740 --> 09:52.120]  They aren't too pussy about it and leave too many leaves and leave it real furry.
[09:52.120 --> 09:55.180]  They know right where to go take off those leaves.
[09:55.180 --> 09:58.380]  But if I do want it a little bit more, I just tell them, go back through and just do
[09:58.380 --> 09:59.740]  another quick strip.
[09:59.740 --> 10:01.820]  And they can just go through and do another quick strip.
[10:01.820 --> 10:03.440]  That way they don't go too hard.
[10:03.440 --> 10:05.560]  That way they don't take too many leaves off.
[10:05.560 --> 10:10.340]  You can always take more leaves off, but you can never put more leaves back on.
[10:10.340 --> 10:12.200]  So that's another great segue.
[10:12.200 --> 10:18.140]  You will be amazed at how quickly these leaves grow back and replace themselves.
[10:18.140 --> 10:22.320]  Depending on your grow environment, depending on your genetics, and depending on your nutrients,
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.620]  you may cut off these leaves and in four or five days, the plant will be twice as leafy
[10:27.620 --> 10:29.200]  as it was before.
[10:29.200 --> 10:30.400]  And that's a good sign.
[10:30.400 --> 10:34.320]  That is showing that that plant is productive and that it is growing.
[10:34.320 --> 10:38.040]  That also means that in four or five, maybe six or seven days, we have to get back in
[10:38.040 --> 10:40.720]  there and pull those leaves off again.
[10:40.720 --> 10:41.720]  But we're not there yet.
[10:41.720 --> 10:45.360]  We are still on the first layer of defoliation.
[10:45.360 --> 10:49.360]  In most cases, I would recommend no matter what size your grow environment is, if you're
[10:49.360 --> 10:54.360]  working in a 4x4 tent or if you're in a 100 light room, I would recommend starting with
[10:54.360 --> 10:57.280]  a light, nice, even defoliation.
[10:57.280 --> 11:01.840]  Then I would go back and defoliate every few days in light phases.
[11:01.840 --> 11:05.620]  Now if you're new and you're just learning how to do this, you may want to pick one plant
[11:05.620 --> 11:07.920]  and defoliate the living shit out of it.
[11:07.920 --> 11:12.120]  You might want to pick another plant and go kind of hard, then pick another one and go
[11:12.120 --> 11:16.160]  medium, then pick another one and go real light, and then pick another one and don't
[11:16.160 --> 11:17.340]  defoliate.
[11:17.340 --> 11:22.060]  Then treat those plants exactly the same otherwise and see how you like the results.
[11:22.060 --> 11:26.180]  Does the plant that you defoliated all the way, does that one grow better than the one
[11:26.180 --> 11:27.680]  that you didn't defoliate?
[11:27.680 --> 11:30.420]  You will notice differences if you do tests like that.
[11:30.420 --> 11:35.820]  I am skipping ahead on my notes a little bit here, but defoliation will be very strain
[11:35.820 --> 11:36.820]  specific.
[11:36.820 --> 11:42.240]  It will also depend on your lighting, your nutrients, and your overall grow environment.
[11:42.240 --> 11:45.960]  If your plants are getting a lot of light and a lot of quality nutrients, you're going
[11:45.960 --> 11:48.100]  to see a lot of production.
[11:48.100 --> 11:51.840]  If you're under smaller lights or your plants are lacking in nutrition, you may not see
[11:51.840 --> 11:55.040]  as rapid leaf development.
[11:55.040 --> 11:58.160]  Defoliation will depend heavily on your environment.
[11:58.160 --> 12:00.760]  I'm skipping ahead, so let me keep myself on track here.
[12:00.760 --> 12:03.760]  Let's talk about defoliating your grow environment.
[12:03.760 --> 12:07.160]  Let's just say maybe you've got a five by five, you've got one light in there, the plants
[12:07.160 --> 12:08.160]  are looking great.
[12:08.160 --> 12:12.700]  They may be in a trellis, they may have sticks holding them up, they may not have any supports.
[12:12.700 --> 12:15.840]  This will work for just about any type of situation.
[12:15.840 --> 12:20.280]  This is my strategy for defoliation.
[12:20.280 --> 12:24.800]  Late in the veg cycle, I like to pull all the crap off the bottom of the plants.
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.320]  Any little sucker branches, any little leaves that look like shit, I really clean the plants
[12:29.320 --> 12:32.600]  up about two weeks before they go into flower.
[12:32.600 --> 12:36.520]  I don't necessarily bottom and lollipop the plants in veg.
[12:36.520 --> 12:38.680]  I will leave most of the branches on.
[12:38.680 --> 12:43.720]  I mainly do just a defoliation and kind of those little sucker branches that are only
[12:43.720 --> 12:46.440]  a quarter of an inch long and they're just kind of starting to develop.
[12:46.440 --> 12:48.820]  I pull all that crap off the bottom.
[12:48.820 --> 12:52.920]  Anything that the light isn't going to reach, I will take all that crap off the bottom.
[12:52.920 --> 12:54.000]  We don't need that.
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.920]  That is going to help the energy move to the top of the plants and those tops can grow
[12:57.920 --> 12:59.760]  and get bigger and beefier.
[12:59.760 --> 13:02.080]  That's where we're going to get our big fat buds.
[13:02.080 --> 13:07.220]  So my defoliation will start late in veg, about two weeks, maybe a week before we go
[13:07.220 --> 13:08.220]  into flower.
[13:08.220 --> 13:11.440]  Again, depending on the strain and the environment.
[13:11.480 --> 13:15.360]  So my plant may be 12 inches tall coming out of the pot.
[13:15.360 --> 13:18.640]  Everything on the bottom, three or four inches of that plant are going to get cleaned up
[13:18.640 --> 13:19.920]  pretty well.
[13:19.920 --> 13:23.640]  All of the little starts and sucker shoots that are sticking out off those branches,
[13:23.640 --> 13:24.840]  I'm just going to clean those off.
[13:24.840 --> 13:28.040]  I'll leave the ends of the branches there and leave all the foliage up the ends of the
[13:28.040 --> 13:31.620]  branches, but I'm just going to clean off the bottoms so that the bottoms of the plants
[13:31.620 --> 13:32.620]  are nice and clean.
[13:32.620 --> 13:34.220]  We don't have a lot of leaf area down there.
[13:34.220 --> 13:38.120]  We don't have a lot of sucker branches down there, wasting nutrients, wasting energy,
[13:38.120 --> 13:39.600]  and not getting any light.
[13:39.600 --> 13:41.280]  That part's not going to grow for you.
[13:41.280 --> 13:42.920]  Let's just clean it right off of there.
[13:42.920 --> 13:45.720]  Now this will start sending energy up to the tops of the plants.
[13:45.720 --> 13:47.960]  The plants are going to start growing a little more quickly.
[13:47.960 --> 13:49.920]  They're getting ready to go into flower.
[13:49.920 --> 13:56.240]  So the first day I put them into flower is when my defoliation really starts to begin.
[13:56.240 --> 14:01.000]  On day one of flower, I like to begin a very strategic defoliation.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.840]  Now what do I mean by strategic?
[14:02.840 --> 14:06.320]  I want to remove the biggest leaves in the room.
[14:06.320 --> 14:08.800]  Those are probably my first targets.
[14:08.800 --> 14:14.840]  I generally remove any leaves that are blocking light from getting to a bud site.
[14:14.840 --> 14:20.280]  If you've got a branch that will develop buds on it, and that branch is being blocked by
[14:20.280 --> 14:25.320]  a leaf and not being allowed to get sufficient light, you can pull that leaf off and let
[14:25.320 --> 14:27.480]  the light get to the bud site.
[14:27.480 --> 14:30.760]  We want to grow more buds, not more leaves.
[14:30.760 --> 14:36.160]  So any leaves that are acting like an umbrella, that are shadowing buds or bud sites below
[14:36.160 --> 14:39.280]  them, I will remove those big leaves.
[14:39.280 --> 14:44.800]  One thing I tell the guys in the commercial facilities is take off any leaf with a purple
[14:44.800 --> 14:46.000]  stem.
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.720]  If you've got a big leaf about the size of your hand and it's got a little purple stem
[14:49.720 --> 14:51.800]  on it, that leaf can go.
[14:51.800 --> 14:54.120]  We don't need that leaf on the plant.
[14:54.120 --> 14:56.480]  But I do make a couple of exceptions.
[14:56.480 --> 14:59.720]  I like to leave the leaves at the very tops of the plants.
[14:59.720 --> 15:03.880]  If you've got a couple of colas that are sticking up at the top, you will always see me leave
[15:03.960 --> 15:06.800]  the leaves at the very tops of those buds on there.
[15:06.800 --> 15:10.120]  I don't know if that is a visual thing for me.
[15:10.120 --> 15:12.520]  I don't know if that's an OCD thing.
[15:12.520 --> 15:17.240]  Something in me makes me think that the plants want those first few leaves at the top.
[15:17.240 --> 15:21.240]  If they are not blocking a lot of light from getting to the lower parts of the canopy,
[15:21.240 --> 15:22.560]  I will leave those.
[15:22.560 --> 15:24.120]  I think they look really good.
[15:24.120 --> 15:29.720]  And something in me feels weird when I remove just those top two or four big leaves from
[15:29.720 --> 15:31.640]  the top main buds.
[15:31.640 --> 15:34.160]  And again, that is just something inside of me.
[15:34.160 --> 15:35.920]  That is something that the plant says to me.
[15:35.920 --> 15:37.600]  I have no science behind that.
[15:37.600 --> 15:39.440]  That is a personal thing that I have noticed.
[15:39.440 --> 15:42.040]  It feels weird to me to take off those top leaves.
[15:42.040 --> 15:45.000]  I will leave those on until just before harvest.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.320]  It will take those leaves off at the very end.
[15:47.320 --> 15:51.080]  But that is my one weird exception when it comes to defoliating.
[15:51.080 --> 15:53.720]  I like to take off most of those giant leaves.
[15:53.720 --> 15:57.560]  I will start by removing every leaf with a purple petiole.
[15:57.560 --> 16:02.600]  Even if you want to dial in your defoliation for optimal light penetration, here is a very
[16:02.600 --> 16:03.880]  good technique.
[16:03.880 --> 16:08.400]  This depends on the quality and power of the light which you are using.
[16:08.400 --> 16:12.400]  If you are using 1000 watt lights, your lights are going to penetrate the canopy much more
[16:12.400 --> 16:15.600]  deeply than if you are using a 400 watt light.
[16:15.600 --> 16:20.040]  So your defoliation will depend again on your lighting and your environment.
[16:20.040 --> 16:23.600]  So what you can do, I like to put my hand in the canopy.
[16:23.600 --> 16:28.320]  Just reach right into the middle of the canopy and see, is the light hitting my hand?
[16:28.320 --> 16:32.880]  And if the light isn't getting to my hand, what leaves above my hand are blocking it?
[16:32.880 --> 16:37.200]  Then, if I feel like the light should be getting that far into the canopy, I will remove the
[16:37.200 --> 16:42.280]  leaves that are in the way that are not allowing that light to get down to those bud sites
[16:42.280 --> 16:44.280]  that I want to get nice and fat.
[16:44.280 --> 16:48.280]  So if you've got any leaves acting like an umbrella that are covering up a bud site,
[16:48.280 --> 16:50.320]  just feel free to pull them off.
[16:50.320 --> 16:53.680]  That will be very beneficial to that bud site below.
[16:53.680 --> 16:57.280]  Now you do have to consider the power of that light.
[16:57.280 --> 17:01.040]  What type of penetration do you realistically expect from that light?
[17:01.040 --> 17:04.580]  We can only defoliate so heavily to allow more penetration.
[17:04.580 --> 17:09.000]  We may need to remove stuff from the bottom because it is not going to get light no matter
[17:09.000 --> 17:10.560]  how many leaves we remove.
[17:10.560 --> 17:15.260]  But we're going to talk about that in a future episode when we talk about bottoming and lollipopping
[17:15.260 --> 17:17.280]  and popping and twisting the plants.
[17:17.280 --> 17:19.960]  Let's stay focused here on defoliation.
[17:19.960 --> 17:23.720]  If you've got a 1000 watt light and it's a few inches above the plants and you feel
[17:23.720 --> 17:28.120]  like that light should probably penetrate 18 to 24 inches into the canopy, put your
[17:28.120 --> 17:30.760]  arm in there about 18 inches in.
[17:30.760 --> 17:35.120]  So you've got your 6 to 12 inches from the light as the top of your canopy and then go
[17:35.120 --> 17:39.400]  down another 18 inches and that's where we're hoping to get light penetration.
[17:39.400 --> 17:40.820]  Is the light touching your hand?
[17:40.820 --> 17:42.960]  Are there a bunch of shadows over your hand?
[17:42.960 --> 17:43.960]  Move your hand.
[17:43.960 --> 17:46.200]  You're going to have to move around branches and you're going to have to do some adjusting,
[17:46.200 --> 17:47.260]  but move around.
[17:47.260 --> 17:48.900]  Are you getting light on your hand?
[17:48.900 --> 17:51.940]  If not, you can probably defoliate a little bit.
[17:51.940 --> 17:56.580]  Now I've said this at the start of the episode, don't go in there and crazily defoliate.
[17:56.580 --> 17:58.700]  I don't know how leafy your plants are.
[17:58.700 --> 18:00.460]  I don't know what genetics you're growing.
[18:00.460 --> 18:02.260]  I don't know what type of nutrients you're using.
[18:02.260 --> 18:03.580]  I don't know what kind of light you've got.
[18:03.580 --> 18:05.820]  I don't know what kind of VPD you're working with.
[18:05.820 --> 18:09.100]  I don't know how leafy you're starting with and I don't know how the plants are going
[18:09.100 --> 18:10.100]  to react.
[18:10.100 --> 18:11.780]  So go light.
[18:11.780 --> 18:14.620]  Go in there and just do a level one defoliation.
[18:14.620 --> 18:17.760]  I don't know how big your room is, so I don't even know how many leaves you should expect
[18:17.760 --> 18:18.860]  to pull out of there.
[18:18.860 --> 18:21.940]  Just go pull a bunch of leaves and just look in there and say, does it look like I've done
[18:21.940 --> 18:22.940]  anything?
[18:22.940 --> 18:24.140]  And it probably won't.
[18:24.140 --> 18:25.300]  Just leave it right there.
[18:25.300 --> 18:26.500]  You'll be okay.
[18:26.500 --> 18:27.500]  See how the plants react.
[18:27.500 --> 18:32.060]  Then in two or three days, do it again and just keep doing it until you think, huh, those
[18:32.060 --> 18:33.700]  look a little bit bare.
[18:33.700 --> 18:37.340]  Once you start thinking, they kind of almost look like I took too much off.
[18:37.340 --> 18:39.780]  That's probably right where you want to be.
[18:39.780 --> 18:42.660]  But again, you can always take off more leaf.
[18:42.660 --> 18:45.620]  We cannot glue the leaves back onto the plants.
[18:45.620 --> 18:48.840]  So let's take off a few leaves here on day one.
[18:48.840 --> 18:54.080]  If you are new, wait a few days, maybe three, maybe five days and do a visual inspection.
[18:54.080 --> 18:58.620]  If you're comfortable with taking off more leaves, do that and repeat that process until
[18:58.620 --> 19:02.040]  you are comfortable with the art of defoliating.
[19:02.040 --> 19:08.200]  Now once you are comfortable with it, I recommend a defoliation at the start of week one.
[19:08.200 --> 19:10.900]  We'll go semi-hard at week one because we want to clean up.
[19:10.900 --> 19:12.200]  We haven't taken any leaves off.
[19:12.200 --> 19:13.880]  It's a big, thick, jungly mess.
[19:13.880 --> 19:17.360]  We got to get in there and shave her up for the very first time and make her look good.
[19:17.360 --> 19:19.560]  Week one, we're going to go semi-hard.
[19:19.560 --> 19:23.320]  Week three, we're just going to go back and kind of clean up what is regrown.
[19:23.320 --> 19:25.720]  Then again at week five, we're starting to get bud sites.
[19:25.720 --> 19:27.680]  We can see where all the buds are going to be.
[19:27.680 --> 19:31.740]  This is when I will clean off any of the small sucker branches that I'm sure are not going
[19:31.740 --> 19:33.820]  to make it into anything.
[19:33.820 --> 19:37.160]  Anything that got left behind on previous cleanings and bottomings, that's all going
[19:37.160 --> 19:38.980]  to get removed at this point.
[19:38.980 --> 19:44.400]  And again, I will do a medium heavy defoliation around week five.
[19:44.400 --> 19:50.520]  Week one, I'm going to go back around week seven and I'm going to do the final defoliation.
[19:50.520 --> 19:54.360]  Now this one is fun because we are getting big, sticky buds at this time.
[19:54.360 --> 19:56.040]  Your arms are going to get sticky.
[19:56.040 --> 19:57.720]  Your shirt's going to get sticky.
[19:57.720 --> 20:00.480]  Wear proper gloves and clothing.
[20:00.480 --> 20:04.680]  I really recommend long sleeve shirts when you're in there defoliating because when that
[20:04.680 --> 20:08.760]  resin starts sticking to your arm hair, it really becomes uncomfortable and it is really
[20:08.760 --> 20:12.180]  a bitch to get off if you don't know grower tricks.
[20:12.180 --> 20:15.940]  So on week one, we're going to get in there and we're going to remove everything with
[20:15.940 --> 20:16.980]  a purple petiole.
[20:16.980 --> 20:21.460]  We're going to use our hand to reach into the canopy and see if the light is reaching
[20:21.460 --> 20:22.860]  our hand or our arm.
[20:22.860 --> 20:26.980]  If it's not, we'll remove a few more leaves to try to make that light get to those lower
[20:26.980 --> 20:28.500]  bud sites.
[20:28.500 --> 20:33.360]  If you're a new grower and you're not comfortable with a strong defoliation, do a light defoliation
[20:33.360 --> 20:37.580]  and pay attention to the plants and then keep pulling leaves as you feel comfortable and
[20:37.580 --> 20:39.940]  you will gain confidence as you go.
[20:39.940 --> 20:44.380]  When that plant doesn't die and you see it increase productivity because of your pulling
[20:44.380 --> 20:48.900]  of leaves, you will gain confidence and you will want to go in there and remove more leaves
[20:48.900 --> 20:50.420]  and then you will find that balance.
[20:50.420 --> 20:53.000]  One day you'll pull too many and you'll go, oh, I pissed it off.
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.140]  So get in there and experiment and learn the balance.
[20:56.140 --> 20:59.540]  Once you get comfortable, we'll do a hard strip on week one.
[20:59.540 --> 21:03.380]  Then on week three, we go back and we clean up the stuff that has started to grow back.
[21:03.380 --> 21:06.100]  We are starting to see where the bud sites are popping up.
[21:06.260 --> 21:09.900]  At this point, we have probably bottomed and lollipop the plants.
[21:09.900 --> 21:13.260]  So you know how far your bud sites are going to be up on the plant.
[21:13.260 --> 21:16.820]  You know how far you expect the penetration from the light to get into the canopy.
[21:16.820 --> 21:20.440]  So now we've got a really good idea of what needs to be defoliated.
[21:20.440 --> 21:25.300]  So week three, you will have a lot of confidence and a lot of tips from the environment and
[21:25.300 --> 21:28.460]  the plants themselves on what to defoliate.
[21:28.460 --> 21:30.800]  Then on week five, that is a fun one.
[21:30.800 --> 21:34.900]  We get to go in there and we see all the buds getting chunky and now we can see the leaves
[21:34.900 --> 21:36.840]  that are obvious over the bud sites.
[21:36.840 --> 21:38.540]  A lot more leaves have grown back.
[21:38.540 --> 21:40.620]  Some of the older leaves have gotten bigger.
[21:40.620 --> 21:43.700]  Let's take off all the crap that is blocking the light.
[21:43.700 --> 21:49.020]  While you're doing every defoliation, carefully look for bugs.
[21:49.020 --> 21:50.460]  Carefully look for issues.
[21:50.460 --> 21:51.620]  That is part of the job.
[21:51.620 --> 21:55.400]  When you're defoliating, when you're doing anything with the plants, the secondary task
[21:55.400 --> 21:58.160]  on your mind is looking for issues.
[21:58.160 --> 22:01.580]  So on week five, we go in there and we pull out all the big leaves that are covering up
[22:01.580 --> 22:02.580]  bud sites.
[22:02.900 --> 22:05.900]  Then on week seven, we are getting ready for harvest.
[22:05.900 --> 22:10.060]  We've only got maybe one, maybe three more weeks at the most until we're going to harvest
[22:10.060 --> 22:11.300]  these plants.
[22:11.300 --> 22:14.540]  You may be beginning to see yellow leaves.
[22:14.540 --> 22:18.180]  Absolutely remove those as soon as possible.
[22:18.180 --> 22:22.020]  At week seven, I like to take off the majority of the big leaves.
[22:22.020 --> 22:23.600]  I keep saying go slowly.
[22:23.600 --> 22:27.940]  By this point, we're going to go in there and pull off most of the leaves.
[22:27.940 --> 22:33.220]  Then a day or two before harvest, I send the trim crew in and they do a pre-harvest
[22:33.220 --> 22:34.220]  strip.
[22:34.220 --> 22:38.620]  They take off all of the giant leaves and they will also take off a lot of the sugar
[22:38.620 --> 22:39.620]  leaves.
[22:39.620 --> 22:45.100]  I didn't mention this before, 99% of this defoliation is done by hand.
[22:45.100 --> 22:46.960]  We are not using scissors.
[22:46.960 --> 22:48.840]  Just grab the leaf and just pop it right off.
[22:48.840 --> 22:50.020]  It will come off.
[22:50.020 --> 22:52.640]  Some of the guys are so quick that it is scary.
[22:52.640 --> 22:55.580]  I'm going to hit the microphone and the speed that these guys pull leaves.
[22:55.580 --> 22:58.540]  It sounds like this.
[22:58.540 --> 22:59.540]  They just go.
[22:59.540 --> 23:00.940]  You tell them, one, two, three, go.
[23:00.940 --> 23:03.220]  They've got good music on and they're nice and motivated.
[23:03.220 --> 23:05.420]  They know the job and they know how long it takes.
[23:05.420 --> 23:06.980]  They just get in there and go.
[23:06.980 --> 23:10.880]  Once you get good at it, you will be a defoliation monster.
[23:10.880 --> 23:14.540]  You just use your thumb to grab that leaf and just pop it right off of there.
[23:14.540 --> 23:18.980]  Over time, once you get comfortable and develop experience, you will also develop a lot of
[23:18.980 --> 23:19.980]  confidence.
[23:19.980 --> 23:23.700]  You will start to see the results of your defoliation and you will start to learn how
[23:23.700 --> 23:26.900]  to dial it in for each strain.
[23:26.900 --> 23:30.620]  Some strains may not react super well to defoliation.
[23:30.620 --> 23:36.380]  The strains that don't have a lot of leaves may not respond well to a heavy defoliation.
[23:36.380 --> 23:41.540]  You're going to have to learn to be plant specific when it comes to tricks like this.
[23:41.540 --> 23:46.140]  As long as you understand the main goal and you don't go too hard, you will become very
[23:46.140 --> 23:50.140]  good at defoliating your cannabis garden in no time.
[23:50.140 --> 23:54.440]  The main idea here is just take off all the extra leaves and you will start to identify
[23:54.440 --> 23:55.700]  what those extra leaves are.
[23:55.700 --> 23:59.660]  It is very easy to identify anything with a long purple petiole.
[23:59.660 --> 24:00.700]  Just take that right out of there.
[24:00.700 --> 24:01.700]  We don't need it.
[24:01.700 --> 24:04.100]  Now, we've got a bunch of leaves at the end.
[24:04.100 --> 24:06.000]  What are we going to do with all of these leaves?
[24:06.000 --> 24:07.540]  That is a great question.
[24:07.540 --> 24:10.420]  Some people choose to juice their leaves.
[24:10.420 --> 24:14.740]  Now, if you are spraying any type of pesticide, please do not juice your leaves.
[24:14.740 --> 24:17.020]  Please do not give them to anybody to be juiced.
[24:17.020 --> 24:20.540]  If you've sprayed pesticides or essential oils, do not do that.
[24:20.540 --> 24:22.300]  We don't want to juice that shit.
[24:22.300 --> 24:25.620]  A lot of people use their leaves in compost.
[24:25.620 --> 24:28.540]  If you've got a way to compost your leaves, that is a great way to get rid of them.
[24:28.540 --> 24:32.680]  If you're running a no-till garden, if you're doing recycled beds, just throw those leaves
[24:32.680 --> 24:37.180]  right into the compost, right into the recycled soil beds, or you can just drop them right
[24:37.180 --> 24:41.620]  into the no-till garden and then they will decompose and they will become energy and
[24:41.620 --> 24:43.700]  food for your plants and for your worms.
[24:44.020 --> 24:48.700]  Now, if you were going to throw away these leaves, be very careful.
[24:48.700 --> 24:54.260]  It looks extremely suspicious to see a trash bag with pot leaves in it sitting out by the
[24:54.260 --> 24:57.420]  curb when you're waiting for the trash man to pick it up.
[24:57.420 --> 25:00.820]  Just imagine you take that bag of trash out there and it's super fine, but then some punk-ass
[25:00.820 --> 25:05.060]  kid comes by and he's on his bike and he hits the trash bag with his bike and the pegs go
[25:05.060 --> 25:08.100]  right through the bag and now your trash bag's open and now right in front of your house
[25:08.100 --> 25:09.900]  is a bunch of weed leaves.
[25:09.900 --> 25:15.700]  Depending on where you are, it only takes one leaf to cause giant problems for yourself
[25:15.700 --> 25:16.780]  and your future.
[25:16.780 --> 25:21.340]  So be very careful with what you do with these leaves once they're defoliated.
[25:21.340 --> 25:23.580]  Think about that overall when you're growing.
[25:23.580 --> 25:25.540]  What are you going to do with all of the trash?
[25:25.540 --> 25:27.100]  Are you going to compost it?
[25:27.100 --> 25:28.500]  Do you have a wood chipper?
[25:28.500 --> 25:30.580]  What is going to happen to all that stuff?
[25:30.580 --> 25:34.460]  How are you going to get rid of it safely and not get yourself into any trouble?
[25:34.460 --> 25:37.580]  Now, I feel like I've covered the basics of defoliation.
[25:37.580 --> 25:39.780]  Basically, you take the leaves off.
[25:39.780 --> 25:44.940]  Strategically, I like to do it at the start of week one of flower, the start of week three,
[25:44.940 --> 25:51.300]  the start of week five, the start of week seven, and then I even do a pre-harvest defoliation.
[25:51.300 --> 25:57.040]  You'll have to learn your plant specifics on how hard to defoliate these plants.
[25:57.040 --> 26:02.380]  The main goal is to remove excess leaves to make more room for light to penetrate the
[26:02.380 --> 26:03.380]  canopy.
[26:03.380 --> 26:05.540]  It's also that will help control your humidity.
[26:05.540 --> 26:09.980]  That is also going to help prevent things like powdery mildew and bud rot.
[26:09.980 --> 26:15.620]  And we are also going to make less hangout spaces, less party zones for pests like spider
[26:15.620 --> 26:17.260]  mites and thrips.
[26:17.260 --> 26:19.820]  So I hope that explains defoliation.
[26:19.820 --> 26:24.100]  When I work in a commercial environment, the day after I defoliate, I generally do some
[26:24.100 --> 26:25.700]  popping and twisting.
[26:25.700 --> 26:29.220]  So in a future episode, we're going to have to talk about popping and twisting, and we
[26:29.220 --> 26:35.340]  will also talk about bottoming and lollipopping our ganja plants for increased production.
[26:35.340 --> 26:36.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, this was a fun episode.
[26:36.940 --> 26:38.740]  I hope you had as much fun as I did.
