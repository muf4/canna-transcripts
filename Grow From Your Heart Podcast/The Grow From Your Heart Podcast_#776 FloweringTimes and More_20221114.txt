[00:00.000 --> 00:04.320]  If you have ever gone to the store for one item, you spent a bunch of money, then got
[00:04.320 --> 00:08.680]  home and realized you forgot to get the one item you went for, now's a good time to click
[00:08.680 --> 00:27.930]  subscribe.
[00:27.930 --> 00:29.490]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:29.490 --> 00:32.150]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:32.150 --> 00:36.410]  This is episode 776 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:36.410 --> 00:38.970]  I've got a fun show lined up for us.
[00:38.970 --> 00:42.890]  Before we jump in, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who continue
[00:42.890 --> 00:45.770]  to support the show on Patreon.
[00:45.770 --> 00:49.530]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to a long
[00:49.530 --> 00:52.490]  time supporter, our friend Nomi by my guacamole.
[00:52.490 --> 00:54.770]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Danger Cat.
[00:54.770 --> 00:58.210]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to OG Roach and the Devil's Weed.
[00:58.210 --> 01:01.010]  I want to send a big fist bump to Grow Man Stan.
[01:01.010 --> 01:03.610]  Let's send a special thank you shout out to Crafted Flower.
[01:03.610 --> 01:06.390]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to my buddy Kojax.
[01:06.390 --> 01:09.390]  Let's send a special thank you shout out to one of my favorite photographers, our friend
[01:09.390 --> 01:10.830]  Levity Love Day.
[01:10.830 --> 01:13.870]  Let's send a big thank you to another long time supporter, Quazi.
[01:13.870 --> 01:16.430]  Let's send a high five and a fist bump to G7.
[01:16.430 --> 01:20.430]  Then let's send a big old Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to my friend Danny
[01:20.430 --> 01:21.630]  Potts.
[01:21.630 --> 01:26.570]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:26.570 --> 01:30.150]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:30.150 --> 01:36.630]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:36.630 --> 01:40.030]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen and you know I do include
[01:40.030 --> 01:44.510]  a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all
[01:44.510 --> 01:47.910]  of my friends to support the podcast.
[01:47.910 --> 01:52.070]  Speaking of support, let's send a big shout out to everybody in Colorado who voted to
[01:52.070 --> 01:55.150]  support the legalization of medical mushrooms.
[01:55.150 --> 01:56.150]  That's right.
[01:56.150 --> 02:01.030]  In the state of Colorado, we recently had an election and we did pass the legalization
[02:01.030 --> 02:02.670]  of medical mushrooms.
[02:02.670 --> 02:04.950]  In my opinion, that is a huge step forward.
[02:04.950 --> 02:08.750]  I believe that if a medicine works for you, you should be able to take it.
[02:08.750 --> 02:13.330]  I was a big proponent, obviously a big supporter of medical cannabis and I am also a big supporter
[02:13.330 --> 02:15.270]  of the medical mushroom movement.
[02:15.270 --> 02:18.950]  I believe like I said, if something helps you improve the quality of your life, if your
[02:18.950 --> 02:23.030]  mental state is improved, if your physical state is improved, we should be able to consume
[02:23.030 --> 02:24.110]  what we like.
[02:24.110 --> 02:27.830]  Even if it doesn't improve our state, we should be able to do what we like to do with
[02:27.830 --> 02:28.950]  and to our bodies.
[02:28.950 --> 02:30.950]  That's the freedom that I feel we should be given.
[02:30.950 --> 02:34.470]  So I do support this legalization of medical mushrooms.
[02:34.470 --> 02:36.950]  Big up to the entire state of Colorado.
[02:36.950 --> 02:38.310]  Thank you to everybody who voted for that.
[02:38.310 --> 02:39.630]  I definitely voted for that.
[02:39.630 --> 02:42.430]  I know several people who were on team mushrooms.
[02:42.430 --> 02:44.770]  So big up, proud of you Colorado.
[02:44.770 --> 02:48.710]  You guys, this can be taken as a very serious change in time.
[02:48.710 --> 02:51.150]  This is how the medical marijuana movement started.
[02:51.150 --> 02:53.170]  This is how dispensaries popped up.
[02:53.230 --> 02:56.370]  This is how we started the cannabis movement in Colorado.
[02:56.370 --> 02:58.290]  It started with the medical cannabis.
[02:58.290 --> 03:02.810]  We had a couple of dispensaries, then we had a lot of dispensaries, then they were everywhere.
[03:02.810 --> 03:06.290]  That led to people that didn't have medical marijuana seeing dispensaries and saying,
[03:06.290 --> 03:07.330]  why can't I shop there?
[03:07.330 --> 03:09.450]  Then we passed recreational cannabis.
[03:09.450 --> 03:14.250]  Now we've got legal adult use cannabis where everybody 21 and over can walk into a dispensary.
[03:14.250 --> 03:17.590]  If they've got the proper ID, they can buy legal cannabis.
[03:17.590 --> 03:20.890]  This is the same thing that is happening with medical mushrooms.
[03:20.890 --> 03:24.850]  Pretty soon, if we shape the laws correctly, there will be stores where you can go and
[03:24.850 --> 03:28.890]  you can buy your legal medical mushrooms.
[03:28.890 --> 03:33.790]  If you have been growing, cultivating, spreading mushroom magic since before legalization,
[03:33.790 --> 03:38.130]  this could be the time for you to take control of a brand new business opportunity.
[03:38.130 --> 03:41.150]  You could possibly open a mushroom dispensary.
[03:41.150 --> 03:43.730]  This is how the medical marijuana movement happened.
[03:43.730 --> 03:47.170]  This will be no different with medical mushrooms, in my opinion.
[03:47.170 --> 03:50.530]  A lot of people look up to those few people who started the medical cannabis movement
[03:50.530 --> 03:55.650]  here who are well known for growing, making concentrates, just being involved in the movement.
[03:55.650 --> 03:59.410]  You look at those people like pioneers, you can be that in the mushroom movement if you
[03:59.410 --> 04:02.010]  take the initiative to do that now.
[04:02.010 --> 04:05.530]  If you are a business minded person, if you are a mushroom cultivator, if you've been
[04:05.530 --> 04:10.850]  a mushroom magician, if you've been a mushroom shaman for several years, there are a few
[04:10.850 --> 04:13.850]  of my friends that your faces are popping into my mind right now.
[04:13.850 --> 04:15.870]  You know who I'm talking to, bro.
[04:15.870 --> 04:17.210]  You're here in Colorado.
[04:17.210 --> 04:18.770]  You're already cultivating mushrooms.
[04:18.770 --> 04:20.090]  You know how to do it.
[04:20.090 --> 04:21.090]  Let's get you a building.
[04:21.090 --> 04:23.650]  Let's set you up a fully legal mushroom dispensary.
[04:23.650 --> 04:28.010]  Now is the time you guys, let's figure out how legal that is, how you can do it.
[04:28.010 --> 04:32.490]  Get ahead of the game and let's get that going because if you don't get it going, eventually
[04:32.490 --> 04:37.450]  some corporation or some big time company will come in and they will take over your
[04:37.450 --> 04:38.450]  spot.
[04:38.450 --> 04:41.110]  You've got passion, you've got commitment, you've got the magic.
[04:41.110 --> 04:43.690]  You don't want some company coming in that doesn't have that.
[04:43.690 --> 04:47.050]  They've got money and they've got the ability to buy a building and produce mushrooms and
[04:47.050 --> 04:48.050]  sell them.
[04:48.050 --> 04:51.730]  I prefer somebody with some experience and some passion in it, just like we preferred
[04:51.730 --> 04:52.730]  in cannabis.
[04:52.730 --> 04:54.570]  All right, so now's the opportunity, you guys.
[04:54.570 --> 04:55.970]  That was the bottom line there.
[04:55.970 --> 05:00.370]  Big up to Colorado for passing the medical mushroom initiative there.
[05:00.370 --> 05:05.390]  And also you guys, if this is your spot in the world, this may be your time to shine.
[05:05.390 --> 05:08.050]  Let's get that medical mushroom dispensary going.
[05:08.050 --> 05:10.290]  And hey, once you get it going, reach out.
[05:10.290 --> 05:16.450]  I would love to trade some advertising for some store credit if you know what I'm saying.
[05:16.450 --> 05:17.450]  All right.
[05:17.450 --> 05:18.650]  Big up to the mushroom gang.
[05:18.650 --> 05:19.770]  Big up to everybody who voted.
[05:19.770 --> 05:21.850]  I know I try not to get too political on this show.
[05:21.850 --> 05:22.850]  Mike's not here today.
[05:22.850 --> 05:26.170]  We don't need to talk about politics, but big up to everybody who voted.
[05:26.170 --> 05:30.550]  We are obviously making change because we did legalize mushrooms.
[05:30.550 --> 05:31.970]  That's pretty amazing to me.
[05:31.970 --> 05:33.210]  All right, let's move forward.
[05:33.210 --> 05:34.770]  I do have something else I want to talk about.
[05:34.770 --> 05:40.930]  There is one person who watches and listens to this podcast who sends me plenty of emails
[05:40.930 --> 05:44.890]  and they question every single thing that I say.
[05:44.890 --> 05:46.410]  They doubt all of my techniques.
[05:46.410 --> 05:51.530]  They doubt all of my methods, but then they grow using a lot of my techniques and methods.
[05:51.530 --> 05:55.370]  But every podcast I put out, I get feedback about how one thing I said could have been
[05:55.370 --> 05:58.050]  wrong, how it would have been better if I did this.
[05:58.050 --> 05:59.890]  I want to say that is good.
[05:59.890 --> 06:01.570]  You guys question everything.
[06:01.570 --> 06:04.850]  I am not the only cannabis grower on the planet.
[06:04.850 --> 06:06.410]  I'm not the only breeder on the planet.
[06:06.410 --> 06:08.170]  I'm not the only podcaster on the planet.
[06:08.170 --> 06:13.450]  I'm not the only one with ideas and standard operating procedures of how this plant could
[06:13.450 --> 06:15.170]  and can be grown.
[06:15.170 --> 06:16.250]  I don't know your room.
[06:16.290 --> 06:17.290]  I don't know your environment.
[06:17.290 --> 06:18.290]  I don't know your needs.
[06:18.290 --> 06:23.330]  Maybe I'm completely wrong with what you need from a cannabis plant or your cultivation.
[06:23.330 --> 06:27.450]  When I say something, I'm speaking what works for me and what has been proven to work in
[06:27.450 --> 06:33.130]  a commercial environment and several other private and personal cultivation areas.
[06:33.130 --> 06:34.850]  It might not work for you.
[06:34.850 --> 06:37.610]  So take everything I say as suggestion.
[06:37.610 --> 06:38.610]  Do your own research.
[06:38.610 --> 06:40.730]  And if you question things that I say, that is good.
[06:40.730 --> 06:42.110]  You should question everything.
[06:42.110 --> 06:43.990]  You should never trust anybody.
[06:43.990 --> 06:48.010]  You should always double check me, reference me, cross check me, make sure that what I'm
[06:48.010 --> 06:50.910]  saying applies to the project you were working on.
[06:50.910 --> 06:54.150]  I enjoy that there's somebody out there who's questioning everything that I say.
[06:54.150 --> 06:58.850]  It keeps me on my toes and it reminds me that the things I'm teaching, maybe I say, do this
[06:58.850 --> 07:02.630]  to your plant on one episode, then I'll read a totally different message and I'll say,
[07:02.630 --> 07:04.390]  do not do this to your plant.
[07:04.390 --> 07:08.050]  And it'll just be situational, but maybe in a different situation, it would be totally
[07:08.050 --> 07:09.310]  different advice.
[07:09.310 --> 07:13.590]  So take everything I say situationally and take it all as a suggestion.
[07:13.590 --> 07:15.350]  And remember, I am not the wizard of Oz.
[07:15.350 --> 07:16.870]  I'm not the grow guru.
[07:16.870 --> 07:19.510]  I've got a lot of experience in different types of environments.
[07:19.510 --> 07:24.310]  I've grown in homes, I've grown in warehouses, I've grown in garages, I've grown in shacks,
[07:24.310 --> 07:28.310]  I've grown in any type of environment you can imagine, a beautiful warehouse, a filthy
[07:28.310 --> 07:29.310]  warehouse.
[07:29.310 --> 07:32.250]  I've done grows indoors and outdoors in greenhouses.
[07:32.250 --> 07:35.310]  So that makes me think that I know how to do a lot of things, but I may not know how
[07:35.310 --> 07:37.710]  to do exactly what you need done.
[07:37.710 --> 07:42.070]  So get some ideas, do some research and definitely cross reference and double check because I'm
[07:42.070 --> 07:43.870]  not the only one out here teaching.
[07:43.870 --> 07:45.970]  There are other ideas and ways to do it.
[07:45.970 --> 07:47.830]  The way that I do it is the way that I do it.
[07:47.830 --> 07:50.270]  The way you do it may be totally different and guess what?
[07:50.270 --> 07:51.270]  It's not wrong.
[07:51.270 --> 07:53.190]  The way another guy does it could be totally different.
[07:53.190 --> 07:54.190]  Guess what?
[07:54.190 --> 07:55.190]  Still not wrong.
[07:55.190 --> 08:00.950]  As long as we are all having a safe, effective, satisfying harvest, nobody's doing it wrong.
[08:00.950 --> 08:05.970]  When you do it wrong is when you are contaminating product, poisoning patients or killing plants.
[08:05.970 --> 08:07.590]  That's when you're doing it wrong.
[08:07.590 --> 08:10.670]  So if you're questioning what I'm teaching you, that is good.
[08:10.670 --> 08:11.990]  Question everything.
[08:11.990 --> 08:13.550]  Don't believe anything anybody says.
[08:13.550 --> 08:17.350]  Like I said, double check me, cross check me, check some references, listen to other
[08:17.350 --> 08:19.070]  podcasts, read some other books.
[08:19.070 --> 08:23.550]  Honestly, before you even listen to my podcast, I would highly recommend that you read a few
[08:23.550 --> 08:25.430]  basic grow books.
[08:25.430 --> 08:26.910]  A lot of people send me questions.
[08:26.910 --> 08:31.710]  I see crazy questions on social media and I honestly think that many of those questions
[08:31.710 --> 08:35.150]  could have been answered if somebody just bought a basic grow book from your favorite
[08:35.150 --> 08:36.150]  grow author.
[08:36.150 --> 08:40.390]  It could be Ed Rosenthal, Jorge Cervantes, Greg Green, Mel Frank.
[08:40.390 --> 08:43.550]  There are a bunch of people out there that write great cannabis books.
[08:43.550 --> 08:44.550]  Read one of them.
[08:44.550 --> 08:48.830]  Learn the basics or go to a website that teaches you the basics so that you understand the
[08:48.830 --> 08:50.070]  basics.
[08:50.070 --> 08:55.230]  Learn the basics, then listen to these podcasts, then read more books, listen to more podcasts,
[08:55.230 --> 08:59.070]  expand your knowledge, double check everything, cross reference it.
[08:59.070 --> 09:03.530]  But I am not offended that you question everything that I say, that you doubt some of my advice.
[09:03.530 --> 09:04.750]  That is a great thing.
[09:04.750 --> 09:05.750]  Challenge me.
[09:05.750 --> 09:06.750]  Challenge yourself.
[09:06.750 --> 09:12.230]  Another one thing that people challenge me on is the 18-6 increasing bud density and
[09:12.230 --> 09:14.430]  speeding up flowering time at the end of flower.
[09:14.430 --> 09:16.070]  Let me talk about that really quickly.
[09:16.070 --> 09:20.830]  I believe that at the end of flower for the past, for the last 10 to 14 days of flower,
[09:20.830 --> 09:26.230]  I turn my lights back to 18 on and 6 hours off because I believe it makes my plants finish
[09:26.230 --> 09:28.990]  a little more quickly and they get a little more dense.
[09:28.990 --> 09:33.390]  I just feel like they get chunkier and fatter and there's more weight and more density.
[09:33.390 --> 09:34.990]  So that's something that I do.
[09:34.990 --> 09:37.750]  A lot of people think that that is completely crazy.
[09:37.750 --> 09:39.630]  You know who really doesn't think it's crazy?
[09:39.630 --> 09:40.750]  The people who have tried it.
[09:40.750 --> 09:43.190]  They all report back with great results.
[09:43.190 --> 09:47.070]  The only people who have negative feedback and negative ideas are the people who have
[09:47.070 --> 09:48.390]  not tried that.
[09:48.390 --> 09:52.590]  So question me, doubt me, but then go try the shit that I recommend and see if it works
[09:52.590 --> 09:53.590]  for you.
[09:53.590 --> 09:54.750]  Don't be afraid to experiment.
[09:54.750 --> 09:55.990]  You may kill a couple of plants.
[09:55.990 --> 09:59.950]  You may also realize that you just learned a super amazing technique that will improve
[09:59.950 --> 10:04.510]  your grow and increase the amount of harvest you're going to get this time and every harvest
[10:04.510 --> 10:06.270]  from here on out.
[10:06.270 --> 10:07.470]  But please do question me.
[10:07.470 --> 10:09.390]  I am not some grow guru.
[10:09.390 --> 10:12.270]  I've got a lot of experience and I've got insomnia.
[10:12.270 --> 10:16.710]  I don't sleep very well and instead of just playing video games or doing something weird,
[10:16.710 --> 10:17.750]  I read the internet.
[10:17.750 --> 10:18.830]  I read books.
[10:18.830 --> 10:21.270]  I scroll around and figure out how to grow weed better.
[10:21.270 --> 10:25.350]  That's how I got really good at producing cannabis is I just have insomnia.
[10:25.350 --> 10:29.670]  Instead of wasting that time, I do a lot of reading and then after I read, I apply what
[10:29.670 --> 10:30.670]  I read.
[10:30.670 --> 10:32.210]  You can read a lot of books.
[10:32.210 --> 10:36.370]  You can read how to do a lot of things, but until you put your hands in the dirt, get
[10:36.370 --> 10:40.890]  some scissors in your hand, pull on some leaves, smell those plants, you're not going to get
[10:40.890 --> 10:42.130]  the experience from the book.
[10:42.130 --> 10:46.810]  You got to get in there, but read those books, then get in there and grow that weed.
[10:46.810 --> 10:51.010]  That's why I know a lot of stuff because I've read the books and then I just went and did
[10:51.010 --> 10:52.010]  it.
[10:52.010 --> 10:56.770]  I got lucky enough to build my own personal grow way early on in the legalization movement,
[10:56.770 --> 11:00.090]  possibly before that, but we won't talk too much about that.
[11:00.090 --> 11:03.970]  Then I got lucky enough to be involved in several commercial facilities and I learned
[11:03.970 --> 11:05.930]  a lot in every one of those facilities.
[11:05.930 --> 11:09.650]  Also, I'm friends with a lot of great growers and breeders, so that helps out.
[11:09.650 --> 11:11.370]  That gives me a lot of input.
[11:11.370 --> 11:12.810]  I'm passionately curious.
[11:12.810 --> 11:14.490]  I love learning.
[11:14.490 --> 11:19.490]  If I care about a subject, I will absorb all of the info that I can as quickly as possible.
[11:19.490 --> 11:20.970]  That's what I've done with cannabis.
[11:20.970 --> 11:25.970]  I feel like it's my job to feed that information to you guys in an understandable way.
[11:25.970 --> 11:29.650]  I take in a lot of things and then I try to filter it and put it back out there in a way
[11:30.210 --> 11:32.610]  that all of you listening learn in a different way.
[11:32.610 --> 11:37.450]  I try to teach each and every one of you in a way that you can be entertained and learn
[11:37.450 --> 11:40.090]  the thing I'm trying to teach without getting bored.
[11:40.090 --> 11:41.730]  I did not like listening in school.
[11:41.730 --> 11:42.930]  You can tell by my rambles here.
[11:42.930 --> 11:47.770]  I've got ADD and I don't like to stay on one subject for very long unless I'm super interested.
[11:47.770 --> 11:51.730]  Obviously, cannabis keeps me interested.
[11:51.730 --> 11:54.530]  Just because I teach one way doesn't mean that's the only way to do things.
[11:54.530 --> 11:55.530]  Double check me.
[11:55.530 --> 11:58.970]  Cross-reference me and be flexible, you guys.
[11:59.010 --> 12:01.170]  Like I said a minute ago, there's no wrong way to do it.
[12:01.170 --> 12:04.690]  The only wrong way to do it is, like I said, if you're poisoning somebody, if you burn
[12:04.690 --> 12:09.130]  down the grow, if you kill all the plants, shit like that is when you fail.
[12:09.130 --> 12:10.290]  You know when you do that.
[12:10.290 --> 12:13.770]  If you're happy with your harvest, you can do everything completely differently than
[12:13.770 --> 12:14.770]  me.
[12:14.770 --> 12:16.010]  I grow in soilless mix and cocoa.
[12:16.010 --> 12:17.090]  You may do it in hydro.
[12:17.090 --> 12:18.690]  We're already going way different.
[12:18.690 --> 12:20.770]  We're both going to have successful outcomes.
[12:20.770 --> 12:24.010]  We're both on the same team and that is what counts.
[12:24.010 --> 12:26.010]  I rambled for way too long on that.
[12:26.010 --> 12:28.450]  Let's move forward into the next topic here.
[12:28.930 --> 12:32.410]  I recently popped into a chat room and they were having a heated debate.
[12:32.410 --> 12:37.370]  The topic of that debate was, when is day one of flower?
[12:37.370 --> 12:41.330]  We like to keep track of how long our plants have been in the flowering phase.
[12:41.330 --> 12:43.410]  It's good to have a mark of when day one is.
[12:43.410 --> 12:47.570]  That way you know how long you've been going, how long to anticipate before harvest.
[12:47.570 --> 12:51.650]  So a lot of people are arguing when is day one.
[12:51.650 --> 12:59.330]  Day one is the day that you turn your timer from 18, six or 24 or whatever it's on to
[12:59.330 --> 13:00.570]  1212.
[13:00.570 --> 13:04.330]  Day one is the day you change that timer to a shorter day.
[13:04.330 --> 13:07.350]  That first short day is day one.
[13:07.350 --> 13:08.750]  That is day one.
[13:08.750 --> 13:10.570]  I wouldn't wait until you see pistols.
[13:10.570 --> 13:13.110]  I wouldn't wait until something else happens.
[13:13.110 --> 13:15.310]  Why make it an algebra problem?
[13:15.310 --> 13:16.410]  We've already got the answer.
[13:16.410 --> 13:17.490]  It was today.
[13:17.490 --> 13:22.810]  I changed the light from 18, six to 1212 on Thursday, November 10th.
[13:22.810 --> 13:23.810]  That is day one.
[13:23.810 --> 13:24.810]  We're going to write that down.
[13:24.810 --> 13:27.130]  That will forever be day one that can't change.
[13:27.130 --> 13:28.930]  That won't be adjusted.
[13:28.930 --> 13:31.650]  That is the solid day one.
[13:31.650 --> 13:36.250]  The breeders write on the seed pack how long we think those seeds should probably take.
[13:36.250 --> 13:37.850]  And I am putting those numbers on the pack.
[13:37.850 --> 13:39.290]  I'm making the seeds.
[13:39.290 --> 13:40.930]  I'm the one making the packages.
[13:40.930 --> 13:42.290]  I'm making the labels.
[13:42.290 --> 13:47.210]  I know that those seeds are going to take approximately 70 days from the day that you
[13:47.210 --> 13:48.450]  change the light cycle.
[13:48.450 --> 13:52.890]  I didn't change the light cycle, wait to see something happen, then start counting.
[13:52.890 --> 13:54.290]  That is that's silly.
[13:54.290 --> 13:56.290]  That is what I'm calling that an algebra problem.
[13:56.290 --> 14:01.570]  It's not flower time plus two minus two weeks minus five days plus the amount of light hours.
[14:01.570 --> 14:06.370]  No, it's from fucking like I said, November 10th is day one because that's when we changed
[14:06.370 --> 14:07.370]  the timer.
[14:07.370 --> 14:09.970]  That is the day on my seed packages.
[14:09.970 --> 14:14.930]  You will see stuff like nine to 10 weeks flowering time, 10 to 12 weeks flowering time.
[14:14.930 --> 14:19.530]  I put that stuff on there because I have determined that that is how long those seeds take in
[14:19.530 --> 14:21.570]  the average grow environment.
[14:21.570 --> 14:25.490]  I have grown those seeds myself, grown them plenty of times to see how long they take
[14:25.490 --> 14:27.170]  in my grow space.
[14:27.170 --> 14:30.610]  Then I sent those seeds out to friends, to testers, and they grow them.
[14:30.610 --> 14:31.850]  They send me test results.
[14:31.850 --> 14:33.530]  They send me test reports.
[14:33.530 --> 14:36.130]  They tell me how long it took those plants to flower.
[14:36.130 --> 14:39.410]  I compile all of that data and I do an average basically.
[14:39.410 --> 14:42.650]  Most of the time it's about 70 days for the stuff that I breed.
[14:42.650 --> 14:44.370]  I see some stuff come a little bit early.
[14:44.370 --> 14:48.090]  I see some stuff a little bit longer, but I do include that on the package.
[14:48.090 --> 14:52.810]  If I say these plants finish in nine to 10 weeks, that means out of the hundred tester
[14:52.810 --> 14:59.530]  packs I sent, probably 70 to 80% of them finished in the timeframe I printed on that package.
[14:59.530 --> 15:00.890]  There will be outliers.
[15:00.890 --> 15:03.190]  There will always be outliers.
[15:03.190 --> 15:06.130]  Those outliers may finish earlier than the time I recommended.
[15:06.130 --> 15:10.930]  Those outliers also could take longer than the time I recommended on the package, but
[15:10.930 --> 15:15.690]  that number I put on the package is ideally the amount of time it should take for those
[15:15.690 --> 15:18.210]  plants to finish in most conditions.
[15:18.210 --> 15:19.890]  You may have extreme heat.
[15:19.890 --> 15:20.890]  You may have extreme cold.
[15:20.890 --> 15:22.990]  You may have extreme dry or humid.
[15:22.990 --> 15:24.450]  You may over or underwater.
[15:24.450 --> 15:25.970]  You may over or under feed.
[15:25.970 --> 15:30.210]  I don't know what could go on in your room, but in most cases, the time I put on the back
[15:30.210 --> 15:33.530]  of that package is fairly accurate.
[15:33.530 --> 15:37.890]  When I say those seeds are going to take approximately nine to 10 weeks, that means that when I grew
[15:37.890 --> 15:41.250]  them, most of my phenotypes took nine to 10 weeks.
[15:41.250 --> 15:44.370]  When my testers grew them, most of them took nine to 10 weeks.
[15:44.370 --> 15:45.370]  I get a lot of pictures.
[15:45.370 --> 15:47.050]  I get a lot of reports.
[15:47.050 --> 15:51.010]  I just compile that data together and I really pay attention to what people tell me.
[15:51.010 --> 15:55.130]  Then I make all of the descriptions and reports based on what I saw and based on what all
[15:55.130 --> 15:57.290]  of the test growers saw.
[15:57.290 --> 16:01.690]  Then I try to compile and convey that information to you in a useful way.
[16:01.730 --> 16:03.850]  I try to put that data on the package.
[16:03.850 --> 16:05.730]  I try to make sure it's on the website.
[16:05.730 --> 16:10.490]  I really do try my best to get all of that accurate data to you because I know how critical
[16:10.490 --> 16:12.130]  and crucial that is in a grow.
[16:12.130 --> 16:17.250]  It does really help to have a good idea of how long it is going to take for these seeds
[16:17.250 --> 16:19.850]  or plants to finish in your grow.
[16:19.850 --> 16:21.170]  Now let me add on to this.
[16:21.170 --> 16:25.690]  I keep saying the plants may take nine to 10 weeks or eight to nine weeks to finish.
[16:25.690 --> 16:27.990]  Let's talk about something very important here.
[16:27.990 --> 16:33.350]  When I'm saying nine weeks, I mean they will take nine full weeks to finish, not let eight
[16:33.350 --> 16:36.230]  weeks happen and then cut it down at the start of week nine.
[16:36.230 --> 16:38.390]  I mean let nine weeks finish.
[16:38.390 --> 16:41.710]  If I said nine weeks, that is 63 full days.
[16:41.710 --> 16:43.830]  I want that ninth week to finish.
[16:43.830 --> 16:45.530]  You've got to put in that last week.
[16:45.530 --> 16:48.590]  Don't cut it down a full week early.
[16:48.590 --> 16:49.590]  Let it go long enough.
[16:49.590 --> 16:53.470]  Most of what I'm going to breed and sell to you is going to take about 70 days, so make
[16:53.470 --> 16:58.950]  sure you're letting it go at least nine, maybe even 10, maybe 11 weeks.
[16:58.950 --> 17:02.950]  The only real way to tell when that plant is done is to have a scope, maybe a magnifying
[17:02.950 --> 17:06.310]  glass that hooks up to your computer, some way to look at the trichomes.
[17:06.310 --> 17:09.590]  You need at least a 60, maybe a 100x scope.
[17:09.590 --> 17:11.030]  Get in there and look at those trichomes.
[17:11.030 --> 17:15.990]  When they are starting to get amber in color is when it is time to harvest your plants.
[17:15.990 --> 17:17.990]  Look at a couple of different spots at the plant.
[17:17.990 --> 17:18.990]  Look at the top.
[17:18.990 --> 17:19.990]  Look at the middle.
[17:19.990 --> 17:20.990]  Look kind of lower.
[17:20.990 --> 17:22.550]  The tops are going to be more done.
[17:22.630 --> 17:26.190]  The middles won't be done as much and the bottoms are not nearly as finished on some
[17:26.190 --> 17:27.190]  plants, depending on the size.
[17:27.190 --> 17:30.470]  But if you've got large plants, they'll finish at different rates.
[17:30.470 --> 17:31.470]  Look up here.
[17:31.470 --> 17:32.470]  See how much?
[17:32.470 --> 17:33.470]  Look at the trichomes.
[17:33.470 --> 17:37.150]  They're going to go from clear to like a silvery blue to milky.
[17:37.150 --> 17:38.990]  Then they'll start turning amber.
[17:38.990 --> 17:43.870]  When 20 to 30% of those trichomes look like you dipped them in Dr. Pepper, that is when
[17:43.870 --> 17:45.630]  it is time to cut down that plant.
[17:45.630 --> 17:48.670]  But I would look on several different locations of the plant.
[17:48.670 --> 17:49.670]  Look kind of high.
[17:49.670 --> 17:50.670]  Look around the main top.
[17:50.670 --> 17:51.670]  Look around the secondaries.
[17:51.790 --> 17:52.830]  Look at the lowers.
[17:52.830 --> 17:55.410]  See what color the trichomes are.
[17:55.410 --> 17:58.350]  Also don't stress too much on the exact day when you harvest.
[17:58.350 --> 17:59.990]  There is a harvest window.
[17:59.990 --> 18:02.810]  We like to say it's a harvest window of peak ripeness.
[18:02.810 --> 18:05.230]  It's not going to be right at one day, one hour.
[18:05.230 --> 18:07.230]  You've got a couple of days of a window.
[18:07.230 --> 18:11.750]  Some people really overthink and they stress way too hard on when to harvest their plants.
[18:11.750 --> 18:16.550]  As long as you've got 20 to 30% of that amber trichomes going on on your buds, you will
[18:16.550 --> 18:18.310]  have a quality harvest.
[18:18.310 --> 18:22.310]  I recommend letting that first batch go probably 10, maybe 11 weeks.
[18:22.310 --> 18:24.430]  Pay really close attention to the trichomes.
[18:24.430 --> 18:27.190]  Pay really close attention to the health of the plant.
[18:27.190 --> 18:30.350]  Then I don't recommend doing the 18-6 on the first run.
[18:30.350 --> 18:33.230]  I recommend that on runs after you've learned the plant.
[18:33.230 --> 18:35.010]  We need to see how long it takes.
[18:35.010 --> 18:36.570]  We need to learn when to start flushing.
[18:36.570 --> 18:38.690]  We need to learn when to flip the light again.
[18:38.690 --> 18:42.650]  We need to learn the details of this plant before we start doing too many tricks to it.
[18:42.650 --> 18:45.950]  So this first run, let it go 70 days.
[18:45.950 --> 18:46.950]  Pay attention to it.
[18:47.110 --> 18:49.550]  Then maybe next time, let it go 77.
[18:49.550 --> 18:51.630]  Let it go too long the first time maybe.
[18:51.630 --> 18:53.070]  This is just the first date.
[18:53.070 --> 18:55.390]  Make a good first date so you can learn something.
[18:55.390 --> 18:59.110]  The second, the third, the fourth date, that's when things will really start getting hot.
[18:59.110 --> 19:00.770]  Build a relationship with your plants, you guys.
[19:00.770 --> 19:04.430]  Too many people want to grow new shit every time.
[19:04.430 --> 19:06.290]  And I feel like that's fun.
[19:06.290 --> 19:07.290]  That's really cool.
[19:07.290 --> 19:09.630]  You get new flavors, new aromas, a new buzz every time.
[19:09.630 --> 19:13.670]  But if you pick one or two plants and you grow the shit out of them for four or five
[19:13.670 --> 19:17.870]  cycles, you'll learn that like around week three, if I defoliate this one, it really
[19:17.870 --> 19:19.430]  starts chunking up.
[19:19.430 --> 19:23.350]  Around week six, if I give this one a whole bunch of bud swell, it really takes off.
[19:23.350 --> 19:27.110]  If I let this one go 11 weeks, it really finishes super fat.
[19:27.110 --> 19:28.470]  You'll start learning things like that.
[19:28.470 --> 19:32.070]  You'll learn if I give it a little more cow mag or if I cut out the cow mag or give it
[19:32.070 --> 19:35.630]  a little bit of this or that at a certain time, it really goes shebang.
[19:35.630 --> 19:40.210]  Start paying attention to the plants, dial them in, get each cultivar perfected before
[19:40.210 --> 19:43.030]  you add too many more to the mix.
[19:43.390 --> 19:47.430]  All right, so that is my rant on day one is day one.
[19:47.430 --> 19:49.510]  Don't let anybody else tell you otherwise.
[19:49.510 --> 19:51.990]  I am the one who puts the numbers on the package.
[19:51.990 --> 19:52.990]  I made the seeds.
[19:52.990 --> 19:53.990]  I made the package.
[19:53.990 --> 19:54.990]  I made the label.
[19:54.990 --> 19:55.990]  I did the testing.
[19:55.990 --> 19:58.110]  I know how long they should take.
[19:58.110 --> 19:59.750]  So take my advice.
[19:59.750 --> 20:03.350]  Follow that number that I put on my package of my seeds that you bought from me because
[20:03.350 --> 20:04.350]  you trust me.
[20:04.350 --> 20:09.270]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[20:09.270 --> 20:12.630]  growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers, skeptics and believers.
[20:13.230 --> 20:16.110]  I do want to thank each and every one of you for listening to another episode of the Grow
[20:16.110 --> 20:17.750]  From Your Heart podcast.
