[01:09.720 --> 01:14.680]  iry with us on this 710 holiday. You guys know I like to start the podcast off by letting
[01:14.680 --> 01:21.520]  you know what I'm smoking. I just took a gigantic dab of some contraband extracts. Durban Kush
[01:21.520 --> 01:25.660]  sauce. I had one giant crystal left over. I was saving it just for this occasion. It's
[01:25.660 --> 01:30.100]  got me super high. I'm a little bit shaky. I'm completely sweaty. My eyes are jumping
[01:30.100 --> 01:35.100]  around. This is going to be a great podcast. I will do my best not to cough, but this is
[01:35.100 --> 01:40.740]  the 710 episode, so I make no promises. Ladies and gentlemen, this podcast is brought to
[01:40.740 --> 01:44.620]  you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company. If you need new regular or feminize seeds,
[01:44.620 --> 01:49.460]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:50.460 --> 01:55.860]  Alright, you guys, this is the 710 episode. We all know 710 is all about dabbing, but
[01:55.860 --> 02:02.580]  why is 710 all about dabbing? Let's get right into this episode and talk about 710. Why
[02:02.580 --> 02:09.580]  does 710 represent dabbing? Well, if you turn the number 710 upside down, it says oil. And
[02:10.340 --> 02:15.900]  what better time to smoke some oil than 710? Now you might say, who came up with that?
[02:15.900 --> 02:19.700]  I know who came up with that. It was our friend TaskRock from Highly Educated. Big
[02:19.700 --> 02:23.340]  shout out to Task for being a part of the oil movement since the beginning. Task and
[02:23.340 --> 02:27.020]  a few other folks were on a conference call, and they were talking about the new movement,
[02:27.020 --> 02:33.180]  what the future was. And Task coined the phrase 710 on that call. So big shout out to Task
[02:33.180 --> 02:38.900]  and his crew for coining the phrase 710 and starting this oil movement. Alright, so now
[02:38.900 --> 02:44.980]  we know where 710 came from and what 710 means. Let's talk a little bit about dabs and dabbing
[02:45.020 --> 02:50.660]  and actually participating in some 710 activities. Now I didn't write this part down because
[02:50.660 --> 02:54.620]  I didn't think about it, but it just dawned on me. Some people may not be real familiar
[02:54.620 --> 02:59.340]  with dabbing. Some people may be like, what's he talking about, dabs and dabbing? So let's
[02:59.340 --> 03:05.620]  start from the very beginning. A dab is when you take a small portion of a cannabis concentrate,
[03:05.620 --> 03:10.260]  usually some oil or some shatter, or we've moved on to different types of concentrates.
[03:10.260 --> 03:14.300]  We're going to talk about those later in the episode. But you take a small, very small
[03:14.300 --> 03:18.900]  portion of a concentrate, just a dab, just a little tiny piece, like a crumb, like a
[03:18.900 --> 03:24.420]  big piece of kosher salt, like a small seed, just a tiny piece, just a dab. And you put
[03:24.420 --> 03:29.100]  that little dab on a dabber. And then you heat another piece, either a banger or a nail
[03:29.100 --> 03:33.540]  or a bucket. We'll talk about that in the future. Also, you heat up your piece, then
[03:33.540 --> 03:38.940]  you push that dab onto the hot piece, which is attached to your rig. And then you smoke
[03:38.940 --> 03:43.880]  through the rig and you inhale that cannabis concentrate. You just need a little tiny bit.
[03:43.880 --> 03:47.920]  So that's what a dab is. You smoke it just like you would smoke anything else, except
[03:47.920 --> 03:52.120]  you heat the piece and then push the concentrate into it. Instead of putting the concentrate
[03:52.120 --> 03:55.680]  into it and then applying the heat, you just do it backwards. So when I'm talking about
[03:55.680 --> 03:59.520]  dabbing or taking a dab, that's all I'm talking about. Just getting a small piece of cannabis
[03:59.520 --> 04:04.840]  concentrate and putting it into a nail and smoking it through a rig. Inhale, exhale,
[04:04.840 --> 04:09.000]  that's dabbing. It's nothing crazy. You're not doing anything fancy. You're just smoking.
[04:09.200 --> 04:14.200]  Inhale, exhale. That's all it is. So that's taking a dab. Now, the next obvious question
[04:14.200 --> 04:18.640]  is what happens to me when I take that dab? Taking a dab, depending on the size of the
[04:18.640 --> 04:22.160]  dab and the heat of the nail, sometimes the nail's too hot and you cough a little bit
[04:22.160 --> 04:26.360]  from that. Sometimes it'll cause you to cough. Sometimes people just cough from smoking a
[04:26.360 --> 04:30.840]  dab. Expect to cough on your first dab. Don't be afraid to cough. You're going to turn red.
[04:30.840 --> 04:34.320]  You may make a little snot. You're just going to cough harder than you've ever coughed before.
[04:34.320 --> 04:37.720]  That's okay. We're going to laugh at you the first time we've all done it. Any experienced
[04:37.720 --> 04:41.440]  dabber knows that you're going to cough. That's going to be okay. Expect that on your
[04:41.440 --> 04:45.960]  first dab. Now here's the part that you got to be prepared for. Depending on your tolerance,
[04:45.960 --> 04:50.480]  how often you smoke, how familiar you are with being high, how much you've eaten today,
[04:50.480 --> 04:55.240]  your blood sugar, your surroundings, how big your dab is, how long you hold it, how hard
[04:55.240 --> 05:01.400]  you hit it, you may get pretty high off of a dab. If you take a medium-sized dab for
[05:01.400 --> 05:07.280]  your first dab, you're going to go skyrocketing high. These concentrates are in the low 70s
[05:07.280 --> 05:11.160]  to high 80s percent. I've seen them. Some of the concentrates I buy are in the high
[05:11.160 --> 05:17.520]  90s of THCA concentrations. When you're smoking flowers, those are in the high 20s. These
[05:17.520 --> 05:22.040]  are four and five times stronger. That one hit that you take off of a joint that doesn't
[05:22.040 --> 05:26.920]  get you high, this is like taking five hits off of a joint at one time. It's almost kind
[05:26.920 --> 05:32.800]  of like smoking a whole joint at one time is what it feels like sometimes.
[05:32.800 --> 05:37.320]  Now you might say, cool, I want to smoke a whole joint in one hit. You might, but it's
[05:37.320 --> 05:42.920]  going to come on so quickly that you get so high so fast that sometimes it's uncomfortable.
[05:42.920 --> 05:46.480]  Sometimes it makes people paranoid. Sometimes people freak out a little bit. You haven't
[05:46.480 --> 05:51.840]  been this high that quickly until you smoked a dab. It takes a lot to get you there. A
[05:51.840 --> 05:56.680]  big fat bong hit won't do it. A little medium dab, it'll put you in a new place. So the
[05:56.680 --> 06:03.080]  first time you take a dab, be prepared to get super high. Now the benefit to dabbing
[06:03.080 --> 06:08.000]  is if you're smoking for medicinal purposes, it affects you immediately. By the time you're
[06:08.000 --> 06:12.620]  blowing that dab out, some of your medical ailments will be eased. You won't feel them.
[06:12.620 --> 06:17.520]  Your pain will be gone. Your suffering will be limited. You will feel better almost immediately.
[06:17.520 --> 06:21.880]  That's why concentrates are important. That's why it's so popular. So the first time you
[06:21.880 --> 06:26.320]  take a dab, be prepared. Be sitting down. Be with friends. And if you've never smoked
[06:26.320 --> 06:30.400]  flour, if you've never smoked cannabis or marijuana, whatever you want to call it, I
[06:30.400 --> 06:35.240]  highly recommend starting off by smoking some weed. Start off like most of us did. It's
[06:35.240 --> 06:39.060]  kind of intense just to go straight to dabbing, I would assume. I smoked weed for a long time
[06:39.060 --> 06:45.320]  before I smoked a dab. So that is a good segue. Let's talk about the first time I smoked dabs.
[06:45.320 --> 06:51.640]  I smoked plenty of crappy melt hash and weird hash and all kinds of bullshit hash up until
[06:51.680 --> 06:56.520]  this point. And then one day, a friend of mine, we did a little, I got some flowers
[06:56.520 --> 06:59.720]  from him and he gave me this little parchment paper folded in half. And he goes, hey bro,
[06:59.720 --> 07:03.240]  when you get home, put that on top of a bowl and just give that a little hit. And I was
[07:03.240 --> 07:07.000]  like, oh man, I've heard of this. This is that BHO butter stuff people were talking
[07:07.000 --> 07:12.280]  about. So I get home and I take a shower and I get ready to go out for the night. And I'm
[07:12.280 --> 07:14.720]  like, I'm going to go out. It's the weekend. I'm going to go do some shit. And I've got
[07:14.720 --> 07:17.840]  plans with some friends. And I'm like, ooh, I want to get stoned before I go out for the
[07:17.840 --> 07:21.440]  night. And I remember he gave me that little parchment with that stuff in it. And I've
[07:21.440 --> 07:25.360]  got a brand new pipe over there on the drawer. So I get, get that pipe out of the drawer
[07:25.360 --> 07:28.000]  and I put a little bit of bud in there just enough to make sure that shit doesn't fall
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.480]  through the hole. And I put that little bit of wax in there. It was just a, it was more
[07:30.480 --> 07:34.400]  like shatter, but it was kind of, it was like melted shatter since I'd had it for so long.
[07:34.400 --> 07:38.800]  It kind of got funky. So I just put that, it was shatter. I put it on top of the bowl
[07:38.800 --> 07:43.400]  and then I just melted it in with my lighter and I took one fat hit of it and I blew it
[07:43.400 --> 07:49.440]  out. And by the time I was done blowing that smoke out, I was wandering to the bed with
[07:49.440 --> 07:54.840]  my eyes crossed and half closed. And I just laid face down in the bed. I wasn't like in
[07:54.840 --> 08:00.240]  a comfortable position. I just got to where I was in the bed, face down. And I closed
[08:00.240 --> 08:04.480]  my eyes and I went to sleep for about an hour and 20 minutes. And I woke up and I was like,
[08:04.480 --> 08:09.520]  Oh my God, I was still high. I had to get my shit together and then go out. And when
[08:09.520 --> 08:12.520]  I went places, people were like, dude, how high are you? And I was like, bro, I smoked
[08:12.520 --> 08:16.960]  this shit. It fucked me up. So that wasn't even a dab. That was just smoking a little
[08:16.960 --> 08:24.840]  bit of concentrate off of a bowl. My first real dab was from a guy known as Big D, Mr.
[08:24.840 --> 08:31.960]  Daniel Desai from Top Shelf Extracts. He had a booth at the first Cannabis Cup in Denver.
[08:31.960 --> 08:38.040]  Before it was recreational, we had a medical Cannabis Cup at the Xdo Event Center. And
[08:38.040 --> 08:44.280]  Big D had a booth with Broadway Wellness and he had a decent line and he was offering dabs.
[08:44.280 --> 08:48.160]  And I got in line and my date got in line in front of me. I let her take a dab. And
[08:48.160 --> 08:52.600]  when she took her first dab, I had to catch her. She almost fell over. She got wobbly
[08:52.600 --> 08:55.400]  and shaky. I had to put my arms around her and hold her up. I was like, yeah, right.
[08:55.400 --> 09:00.560]  She goes, that shit hits hard. And I was like, I can't fucking wait. And I get up next in
[09:00.560 --> 09:04.120]  line and this big dude with a shaved head, he goes, are you a heavy smoker or are you
[09:04.120 --> 09:08.520]  new? And I go, bro, I smoke. And he goes, okay. And he gave me a decent sized dab off
[09:08.520 --> 09:14.720]  of a swing arm skillet on a dub tube. We'll talk more about that in the future. That dab
[09:14.720 --> 09:19.840]  fucked me up so bad. I don't think I smoked for the rest of the day. I was so high and
[09:19.840 --> 09:25.000]  I coughed for 10 minutes, but it was a great thing. I went back later that day and bought
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.840]  that dub tube and one of those skillets so that I could smoke those dabs all the time
[09:30.840 --> 09:36.160]  after that. So then I came home from that Cannabis Cup and I called up all the friends
[09:36.160 --> 09:41.200]  the next day. I had Kevin over, I had Pops over. Pops, I miss you, brother. Pops passed
[09:41.200 --> 09:45.000]  a few months ago and I miss you, Pops. But I had Kevin over, I had Pops over, Mike was
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.040]  over, pretty sure Tony was over. And I don't remember who else was there. But we all gathered
[09:50.040 --> 09:53.800]  at my house and I showed everybody this new device, this new apparatus. And like, that's
[09:53.800 --> 09:58.600]  fucking crazy. And it was a swing arm skillet. So it looked like you took a bowl that went
[09:58.600 --> 10:04.400]  on your bong, like just a bowl that would fit into the bong. But then you took a longer
[10:04.400 --> 10:08.000]  stem and bent it so that it was upside down so that it looked like you'd pack an upside
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.800]  down bowl is what it looked like. But then they affixed a piece of aluminum wire around
[10:14.800 --> 10:20.120]  it that had a titanium disc at the end of it, like a coin, a coin of titanium. And it
[10:20.120 --> 10:25.240]  would swing to where that titanium coin would line up underneath the bottom of that, the
[10:25.240 --> 10:32.120]  bell of the bowl. Basically, you would heat up that titanium pad, that coin, swing it
[10:32.120 --> 10:38.240]  underneath there, then drop your dab on that titanium pad. And that that nail that skillet
[10:38.240 --> 10:42.760]  would actually fit onto your bong or your rig with a joint like your normal bong bowl
[10:42.760 --> 10:46.400]  would. So then that would be attached to your pipe or your bong or your bubble or whatever.
[10:46.400 --> 10:49.800]  So then you'd put the dab on, you'd heat up the titanium, swing the piece under, then
[10:49.800 --> 10:53.440]  it would be underneath the wide mouth of that bowl. Then you would put the dab on there
[10:53.440 --> 10:56.660]  and you'd smoke and since it was like that bell shape, it would suck the dab smoke right
[10:56.660 --> 11:01.640]  up into there through your pipe and then into your lungs. So I called the crew over, we
[11:01.640 --> 11:05.080]  all gathered in the basement. We all sat around and we all looked at it. We're like,
[11:05.080 --> 11:08.040]  wow, that's crazy. And I heated it up. And back then you guys, we were heating the shit
[11:08.040 --> 11:11.480]  out of it. We thought we had to heat these things so they were fucking glowing. That's
[11:11.480 --> 11:15.160]  not necessary. We're going to talk about dab heat in a minute. Also, I would heat it up
[11:15.160 --> 11:19.680]  and then we all took one or two dabs. We all coughed for like five or 10 minutes. I think
[11:19.680 --> 11:23.680]  we hung out for like 30 minutes total after that. And then we all said our goodbyes. Everybody's
[11:23.680 --> 11:26.880]  like, well, bro, I'm going to go home. I got to go do the rest of my day. I didn't hear
[11:26.880 --> 11:31.360]  shit from anybody in that group until about six hours later. We all started texting each
[11:31.360 --> 11:35.000]  other like, Hey bro, I just woke up from a killer nap. What the fuck are you doing?
[11:35.000 --> 11:39.520]  Like, I just woke up. That shit was amazing. I just woke up starving to death, man. I thought
[11:39.520 --> 11:42.600]  it was hilarious. Everybody that was here had to go home and take a little nap. I didn't
[11:42.600 --> 11:48.480]  hear from him for at least four to six hours each person. So that was our first dab experience.
[11:48.480 --> 11:53.240]  That was how I acquired my first dabs. How I took my first dab. Dabs were available in
[11:53.240 --> 11:57.200]  the dispensaries by this point, I was able to get them from my friend who had introduced
[11:57.200 --> 12:02.480]  it to me. Also, I worked in a local dispensary. So people were coming in and offering us product
[12:02.480 --> 12:06.600]  all the time. I was picking up concentrates from them. Plus I was driving to Denver and
[12:06.600 --> 12:11.240]  finding concentrates all over the place at dispensaries. Plus everybody around here was
[12:11.240 --> 12:16.320]  learning how to make their own concentrates. So that's a good way to segue into the evolution
[12:16.320 --> 12:24.600]  of the actual dabs. Today, I would be embarrassed to show you the dabs that we thought were
[12:24.600 --> 12:31.560]  the best hottest fire shit four or five years ago. Then I guess the word would be mortified.
[12:31.560 --> 12:36.480]  I would be mortified to share with you dabs that we thought were good dabs six or seven
[12:36.480 --> 12:43.160]  years ago. Concentrates have come a long way. Of course, there was always decent like water
[12:43.160 --> 12:48.600]  hash and bubble hash, but I'm talking about BHO, waxes, shatters, things like that. So
[12:48.600 --> 12:55.320]  when it first started, people were making crap. We called it poop soup. It was black.
[12:55.320 --> 13:01.000]  It smelled like hell. It wasn't properly purged. You could tell it still had residual butane
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.920]  in it. You could tell something was wrong. So when you're making BHO, you should use,
[13:06.920 --> 13:11.960]  I prefer a glass tube. Some people will use stainless steel. I've seen people use aircraft
[13:11.960 --> 13:19.200]  aluminum tubes, but you need metal or glass. I've seen people use PVC tubes. Now you're
[13:19.200 --> 13:24.560]  running a solvent through this tube. I would imagine something from the PVC will end up
[13:24.560 --> 13:30.720]  in your concentrate. I've seen people use the shittiest weed. I can only imagine what
[13:30.720 --> 13:34.280]  some of these people were spraying on their weed before they were turning it into BHO.
[13:34.280 --> 13:38.280]  What I'm saying is back in the day, you guys, the stuff that we used to get was black and
[13:38.280 --> 13:44.120]  terrible and funky. And over time, it got a little more clear and a little more clear.
[13:44.120 --> 13:49.560]  People were learning how to make clear, clear shatter. Shatter that was, so let me explain
[13:49.560 --> 13:53.960]  shatter because this was kind of how it first started with shatter and wax and butter. So
[13:53.960 --> 13:59.480]  first it was, first it was this black solid, not solid, but like black layer of stuff that
[13:59.480 --> 14:04.040]  it looks like kind of like, like black Jolly Ranchers. Like if you had a dark Jolly Rancher,
[14:04.040 --> 14:07.880]  a really dark purple Jolly Rancher on some parchment paper, that's what it looked like.
[14:08.040 --> 14:12.760]  It started getting more transparent and turning into an amber honey color. It looks like you had
[14:12.760 --> 14:17.400]  hardened honey or yellow Jolly Ranchers on the parchment paper. That's kind of what shatter
[14:17.400 --> 14:22.520]  looked like. It would be thin sheets and it would be like amber colored glass. And that would start,
[14:22.520 --> 14:27.080]  that started getting better. That tasted better. It had a better high to it. It didn't make your
[14:27.080 --> 14:31.080]  lungs hurt so bad. And then we started learning to smoke it at a little cooler temp. And we're
[14:31.080 --> 14:35.560]  going to talk about that in a minute too. That also affected the, the, the lung burn, the chest
[14:35.560 --> 14:41.560]  burn. And I apologize for clearing the throat a lot. I've been taking a lot of dabs. But it got
[14:41.560 --> 14:48.200]  more clear and it got more shattery. Then we started learning how to make waxes and batters
[14:48.200 --> 14:52.760]  out of that. So wax was, you would take a shatter that was almost done and then you would just whip
[14:52.760 --> 14:57.720]  it. You'd put a Dremel tool to it or just whip it with the whisk real hard and put air in it and it
[14:57.720 --> 15:02.520]  would fluff it up and make it into wax. We learned how to purge things. We learned that running the
[15:02.520 --> 15:07.080]  butane through it, put butane in it. You had to get all of that butane out. We started putting
[15:07.080 --> 15:12.360]  our product into vacuum ovens to get that butane out. We learned a lot of things. So it went from
[15:12.360 --> 15:19.320]  black goop to shatter, which was basically amber colored glass or Jolly Ranchers. And then we
[15:19.320 --> 15:24.280]  learned how to make waxes out of that. Then we had butters or batters, which were kind of waxes
[15:24.280 --> 15:29.160]  that wouldn't solidify. Certain strains have certain turps in it and certain things that just,
[15:29.160 --> 15:34.440]  they all react differently. So sometimes you'll try to make a shatter and you'll end up with
[15:34.440 --> 15:39.160]  what's called snap and peel, which is kind of more like a Laffy Taffy consistency, which is acceptable.
[15:39.160 --> 15:43.640]  It's just what that strain is going to do. So we learned how to purge it. We learned how to get all
[15:43.640 --> 15:47.720]  of the butane out because there were times when you would throw a dab on a hot nail and it would
[15:47.720 --> 15:51.640]  sizzle up at you. We would assume that that was leftover solvents. I have no evidence of that,
[15:51.640 --> 15:56.360]  but that's what we thought was happening. Then we started purging with a vacuum oven and things got
[15:56.360 --> 16:01.480]  a lot better. And a second ago I said Laffy Taffy, but I totally meant a fruit roll-up. So excuse me
[16:01.480 --> 16:04.440]  for that. It would snap like a fruit roll-up. You know, a fruit roll-up, you could just peel off a
[16:04.440 --> 16:08.360]  little piece, it would snap and have that text, that texture. It was more like a fruit roll-up.
[16:08.360 --> 16:13.800]  So forget I said Laffy Taffy, that just dawned on my head. So let me explain waxes a little bit.
[16:13.800 --> 16:19.720]  Waxes were kind of basically like smoking. It was like wax. You could handle it a little better.
[16:19.720 --> 16:24.440]  You could pick it up. It wasn't shattery. So shatter would snap. Sometimes you tried to get
[16:24.440 --> 16:28.200]  some on the dabber and it would snap and it would break and go flying across the room if you put too
[16:28.200 --> 16:32.760]  much pressure on it. Wax was kind of easier to handle because you could pick it up and you could
[16:32.760 --> 16:38.120]  drop it right into the nail. So that was a difference. And a lot of people used to say that
[16:38.120 --> 16:43.960]  wax wasn't purged. And I'm not sure why people would say that because the wax was just as purged,
[16:43.960 --> 16:50.280]  if not more purged, because it's been through the same process as the shatter. Then it was whipped
[16:50.280 --> 16:54.920]  to make it into the wax consistency. And when it was whipped, it released even more
[16:54.920 --> 16:59.240]  residual hydrocarbon. So the waxes are purged. I'm not sure why people always said that.
[16:59.960 --> 17:05.800]  That's what a wax is. It kind of looks like a small piece of a fluffy crayon. Maybe not as
[17:05.800 --> 17:11.080]  dense of a wax as a crayon, but similar. It's just little pieces of broken crayon maybe.
[17:11.080 --> 17:14.440]  And you just need a little bit of that stuff. That would get you super high back in the day.
[17:14.440 --> 17:19.160]  I like taking big old chunks and pressing a giant chunk of wax onto the nail and try to smoke as
[17:19.160 --> 17:23.640]  hard as I can and see when I had to stop. That was always fun. So we started with that black goo.
[17:23.640 --> 17:27.400]  We got that nice and clear. We learned how to get all the residual solvents out of it.
[17:27.400 --> 17:31.240]  We started learning how to preserve turps. We started learning how to make nice and clear,
[17:31.240 --> 17:37.080]  high quality shatter. Shatter was the thing for a long time. Shatter and wax and sometimes butter.
[17:37.080 --> 17:40.120]  If you could find some good butter, that'd be all right. A lot of people were opposed to it.
[17:40.120 --> 17:44.440]  They didn't like the consistency. So shatter and waxes were the hot thing for a long time.
[17:45.240 --> 17:49.320]  Then some of our friends here in Colorado got the bright idea to cut down some plants
[17:49.880 --> 17:56.280]  and freeze them and run them fresh frozen through an OB-DOS machine, which is a closed
[17:56.280 --> 18:01.800]  loop system concentrate making machine. If you're interested in a high quality closed loop machine,
[18:01.800 --> 18:06.440]  look for an OB-DOS from Emotech. Shout out to my friends at Emotech. Hit up Giddy up. He'll
[18:06.440 --> 18:11.720]  take good care of you. But Kind Bill and a few other folks, Kind Bill and Giddy, decided to put
[18:12.680 --> 18:19.960]  fresh frozen plants through an OB-DOS machine. So when you're making ice wax or water hash,
[18:19.960 --> 18:24.920]  it's a good idea to freeze the buds. The frozen buds work better when you're making water hash.
[18:24.920 --> 18:29.480]  They thought instead of drying the plants, let's cut them down and freeze them and put them through
[18:29.480 --> 18:35.000]  the BHO machine, the OB-DOS, the butane extraction device. So they went that method.
[18:35.000 --> 18:41.000]  And what came out, they named it live resin because that fresh freezing process,
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.760]  they cut down the plants, took off the large leaves and then froze them, then ran them through
[18:44.760 --> 18:50.280]  the machine. That fresh freezing process preserved all of the fresh plant terpenes,
[18:50.280 --> 18:55.480]  that essence of the freshly harvested plant. It brought that out in the concentrate and it made
[18:55.480 --> 19:05.160]  this bright gold, mushy, fluffy, textury, delicious. I don't know. It was for a long time.
[19:05.160 --> 19:10.120]  Everybody was crazy about live resin. It was all people would talk about for the longest time. So
[19:10.120 --> 19:17.560]  live resin was made from fresh frozen plants through an OB-DOS machine. Giddy Up and Kind Bill
[19:17.560 --> 19:21.080]  were some of the first folks making live resin because it was done in Giddy's machine.
[19:22.360 --> 19:27.000]  Then our friends at the Garden of Weden, of course, ran a bunch of live resin and won some cannabis
[19:27.000 --> 19:32.760]  cups with that. So the live resin became the thing. Everybody wanted that live resin. Live resin was
[19:32.760 --> 19:39.240]  the way to go. That really revolutionized the machines. It revolutionized extracting and it
[19:39.240 --> 19:45.000]  put some science into it. I think that inspired people because out of the live resin, people
[19:45.000 --> 19:50.520]  learned how to separate the terpenes and the cannabinoids. For a little while now, we've been
[19:50.520 --> 19:57.800]  able to buy jars of strain-specific terpenoids, terpenes. So I've got a little vial in my hand.
[19:57.800 --> 20:04.040]  This is a one dram vial. It contained one gram. Excuse me for clearing the throat again. I
[20:04.040 --> 20:08.280]  apologize. I usually edit those out, but we're going to keep going. It contained one gram of
[20:08.280 --> 20:14.840]  Lemon Jeffrey high terpene full spectrum extract. It was about 99% terpenes and less than 1%
[20:15.480 --> 20:21.720]  cannabinoids in this little jar. A long time ago when we were making shatter and live resin, I
[20:21.720 --> 20:27.080]  would see these little shimmery pockets. You'd have a sheet. So if you ran a quarter pound of
[20:27.080 --> 20:31.400]  flowers, you would end up with about an ounce of concentrates. That's a parchment paper about the
[20:31.400 --> 20:36.360]  size of a notebook piece of paper with a puddle right in the middle of it. That would be your
[20:36.360 --> 20:43.320]  ounce of concentrate. Somewhere in that puddle, I would see a little extra shimmery spot that
[20:43.320 --> 20:48.600]  looked like you just dropped just a little bit of water in there. I would pay attention. I would dab
[20:48.600 --> 20:53.800]  off the edge of the concentrate, this edge over here of the whole slab. We call those a big slab,
[20:53.800 --> 20:57.000]  but if you've got an ounce, that's a slab. I guess an ounce or more would work as a slab,
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.760]  maybe seven grams or more. That's a slab of concentrates. If you saw it on the parchment
[21:00.760 --> 21:05.960]  paper, saw it laying out, you'd say, oh, that's a slab. So I would go from this edge of the slab,
[21:06.120 --> 21:10.120]  this edge of the slab, and I would compare the flavors based on the texture. Some would be,
[21:10.120 --> 21:15.320]  one edge of the slab may be harder than the other, because you've got this big 28 gram piece
[21:15.320 --> 21:21.080]  of concentrate that was made. It was liquid and it solidified again. So now it's non-homogeneous.
[21:21.080 --> 21:25.480]  I feel that some parts of that are going to contain different things. I think those little
[21:25.480 --> 21:29.960]  wetter puddles in the middle that I was spotting were the terps. We were already kind of separating
[21:29.960 --> 21:33.960]  the terpenes from the cannabinoids because I would reach into the middle where those little
[21:33.960 --> 21:38.200]  water pockets were and dab that and it would taste so good. I'm sure that's where the terp
[21:38.200 --> 21:45.080]  pockets were hidden. So now we went from the goop to the waxes and shatters to live resin.
[21:45.080 --> 21:50.600]  Now we learned how to pull out terpenes. I was buying terps and taking chunks of live resin
[21:50.600 --> 21:54.920]  and chunks of shatter and dumping, dunking it right into the terpenes and then taking a fat
[21:54.920 --> 22:00.200]  dab of that. That would be tremendous. That used to make, I feel like the terpenes would
[22:00.200 --> 22:05.240]  enhance the high by a good percentage. The terpenes are not cheap when you're buying
[22:05.240 --> 22:10.440]  cannabis derived terpenes. So it definitely was an experience at that time. They were way more
[22:10.440 --> 22:14.360]  expensive then than they are now. They're about a third of the price now from when they first came
[22:14.360 --> 22:18.120]  out. But that's because a lot more people have learned the tech and they're more available.
[22:18.120 --> 22:25.880]  And that's what happens with legalization. So along with the terps came the high cannabinoid
[22:25.880 --> 22:32.520]  full spectrum extract. If you listen to the podcast often, you've heard us have a few
[22:32.520 --> 22:36.040]  vague conversations about making full spectrum extracts.
[22:38.040 --> 22:43.160]  It happens when there is a solution under pressure. There is butane. Let's just kind of
[22:43.160 --> 22:48.120]  skip the process. But anyway, there's a jar and the part that floats to the top is mainly the
[22:48.120 --> 22:52.840]  terps. The crystals that form in the bottom are the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[22:52.840 --> 22:58.040]  If you leave those crystals in the bottom for a long time, undisturbed with no vibration,
[22:58.040 --> 23:02.760]  you don't open it up, you don't cause it any drama, it's going to form a large diamond if
[23:02.760 --> 23:09.800]  you're doing it correctly. So now we're getting small chunks that we call HCFSE, also known as
[23:09.800 --> 23:15.000]  little crystals, and we're getting HTFSE. So you can get the high terpene full spectrum extract,
[23:15.000 --> 23:21.080]  the top liquid part that's all terps. So you can buy one strand of HCFSE crystals,
[23:21.080 --> 23:25.640]  and then you can buy a couple of different varieties of HTFSE, and you can pour up and
[23:25.640 --> 23:30.440]  make different varieties and different flavors, just like when you used to mix the jelly bellies
[23:30.440 --> 23:34.680]  back in the day. So you can buy one gram of one, two grams of the other and you can have
[23:34.680 --> 23:38.440]  different flavors you can mix and match you can pour them together, or you can just smoke the
[23:38.440 --> 23:43.000]  crystals by themselves. It's always fun. I like to take the crystals and mix them in with some
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.160]  batter and some terps. That's always a good high the batter gives you a good long punch.
[23:47.160 --> 23:52.200]  The terps give it a good flavor and a good head rush. And then that HCFSE crystal makes you go
[23:52.200 --> 23:58.760]  super high. So so you've got your HCFSE small crystals, then you've got your HTFSE, which is
[23:58.760 --> 24:03.960]  the liquids of the high terpene full spectrum extract, you buy a jar of like a gram of we'll
[24:03.960 --> 24:08.360]  say just a gram of Gorilla Glue, high cannabinoid full spectrum extract crystals, and you get
[24:08.360 --> 24:12.600]  another gram of Jack Flash high cannabinoid full spectrum extract crystals, then you go get
[24:12.600 --> 24:17.080]  yourself a couple of jars of terps, maybe some Lemon Jeffrey, and then a cheese. And then you
[24:17.080 --> 24:22.040]  can pour a few drops of this one over here. And then you can take a dab of the Gorilla Glue high
[24:22.040 --> 24:27.080]  cannabinoid full spectrum extract crystals with some Lemon Jeffrey terps on top of it, you can
[24:27.080 --> 24:31.640]  experience that high, then you can get your cheese. I don't even remember the strains I said
[24:31.640 --> 24:34.920]  you guys but you can mix and match that way you've got a little mix and match and it's really fun.
[24:35.560 --> 24:41.160]  And then you definitely do notice different highs from different combinations. So we got to making
[24:41.160 --> 24:48.200]  our own full spectrum extracts. Then came the diamonds, we learned that if you leave those
[24:48.200 --> 24:54.200]  crystals under pressure in solution long enough, they create gigantic diamonds and a lot of people
[24:54.200 --> 25:01.400]  like dabbing just big old diamonds. I think the diamonds get me ridiculously high. I think the
[25:01.400 --> 25:06.040]  diamonds need a little bit of terps added to them, you got to add a couple of drops of terps to the
[25:06.040 --> 25:11.400]  diamonds, or it's a little too intense. I think that the THC crystals, the diamonds make you go
[25:11.400 --> 25:16.840]  super duper high, you skyrocket high like a firework. I think the terpenes that you add to
[25:16.840 --> 25:22.360]  that are the color your firework makes. That may be a weird way to describe it. But the terps are
[25:22.360 --> 25:25.320]  what decide if you're going to get paranoid if you're going to get the munchies if you're going
[25:25.320 --> 25:30.200]  to get laid back if you're going to get talkative, the terps decide what's going to happen. And the
[25:30.200 --> 25:35.240]  THC decides how high you're going to go with that is what I feel. And when there's no terps to it,
[25:35.240 --> 25:38.840]  you just go real high and you kind of get a headache and then you sober up real quickly is
[25:38.840 --> 25:44.280]  what I feel like so it needs some terps to control the drive or the rocket just goes flying off the
[25:44.280 --> 25:49.480]  rails and then it crashes and it's done. So that's the crystals the diamonds by themselves. When you
[25:49.480 --> 25:55.640]  take the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract diamonds that are kind of chunky, and you pour
[25:55.640 --> 26:00.040]  the terps over them and you see those diamonds floating in the liquid terps. I'm sure if you
[26:00.040 --> 26:04.840]  guys pay attention to social media, you see people with little jars, and they've got this
[26:04.840 --> 26:09.000]  golden liquid stuff in there. And they've got these little chunks just floating around and
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.280]  they're these little crystals. That is what's being called sauce. Those are diamonds. Those
[26:14.280 --> 26:20.200]  are HTFSE crystals floating around in terp sauce you guys it's cannabinoids and terp sauce just all
[26:20.200 --> 26:25.400]  floating around. To me that's kind of the most desirable way to smoke right now I like a pretty
[26:25.400 --> 26:30.440]  good size crystal with just a little bit of the terp sauce on it. I like the high from the crystal
[26:30.440 --> 26:33.960]  like I was saying earlier and then I like the terp sauce just to guide that high give it a
[26:33.960 --> 26:40.520]  direction and also add some turbo flavor to it. So that seems to be the trend right now is the sauce,
[26:40.520 --> 26:46.440]  the crystals, the terps and the diamonds seems to be the way to go. Also, we've got to talk about
[26:46.440 --> 26:51.560]  our solventless friends I am not much on the solventless smoke. If you pass me a solventless
[26:51.560 --> 26:57.160]  dab, hell yes I will take it. Do I buy solventless concentrates? Very very rarely. It's got to be
[26:57.160 --> 27:01.880]  very impressive to get me to buy a solventless concentrate. I would rather buy some sauce
[27:01.880 --> 27:06.440]  because they're about the same price. Sometimes the solventless, excuse me with the throat once
[27:06.440 --> 27:11.000]  again, it's 710. Not going to edit it. Keep going. Take a dab with me every time. Every time I clear
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.320]  my throat in this episode you take a dab. That'll be fun. Here we go. But solventless is sometimes
[27:15.320 --> 27:20.280]  more expensive than sauce is what I think I was saying. Let's talk more about solventless.
[27:20.280 --> 27:25.160]  Solventless includes stuff like ice wax. If you see the kids that show up to the dispensary with
[27:25.160 --> 27:28.840]  a cooler and they leave with a little cooler they're probably buying ice wax. They keep it
[27:28.840 --> 27:33.800]  cool until the moment they dab it. Those plants are harvested in a cool environment. They're stored
[27:33.800 --> 27:39.240]  in a cool environment, possibly frozen. I'm not sure. They are processed in a cold environment.
[27:39.240 --> 27:45.080]  They are made with ice water. Then they're grated up in a cold environment. The entire process they
[27:45.080 --> 27:49.640]  are kept in a very cool environment until the minute they are dabbed. A lot of people are
[27:49.640 --> 27:54.840]  opposed to smoking solvents. Our friend Jinkxproof won't smoke butane hash or solvent made hash
[27:54.840 --> 27:59.640]  because he's epileptic and he's afraid to smoke something made with butane which is respectable.
[27:59.640 --> 28:05.640]  So a lot of people go for the solventless. They like the ice wax or the water hash. Also there is
[28:05.640 --> 28:11.000]  rosin. Rosin is made a couple of different ways. Rosin can be made and I'm just going to give you
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.720]  the... I don't make rosin and if you listen to me a lot you know I don't enjoy smoking rosin
[28:15.720 --> 28:20.600]  but I'm not biased. I'm going to try to give you guys a fair rapport on rosin. You make rosin
[28:20.600 --> 28:26.840]  basically by putting a nugget into a little mesh pouch. A very specific micron mesh pouch. I'm not
[28:27.400 --> 28:31.720]  sure of the specific micron because like I said this is not my wheelhouse but this is my
[28:31.720 --> 28:38.600]  understanding. You put a nugget or some nuggets in a mesh pouch. A very specific micron mesh pouch.
[28:38.600 --> 28:44.680]  You then I think wrap that. You fold that into parchment paper. Then you squish the shit out of
[28:44.680 --> 28:49.160]  that with the press. I've also seen people use a hair straightener to do it. They use a hot hair
[28:49.160 --> 28:54.760]  straightener and a clamp to tighten it down real tight. You want heat and pressure. So then you're
[28:54.760 --> 28:59.160]  going to squish that bud with heat and pressure and where that parchment paper where it's folded
[28:59.160 --> 29:03.960]  in half where it's not folded the other side the open side you're going to get some juice dripping
[29:03.960 --> 29:09.160]  out of there. That is your rosin. That golden resin juice that comes out of there. That's rosin.
[29:09.160 --> 29:14.040]  When you unfold that parchment paper you're going to have right around your little square of
[29:15.640 --> 29:20.440]  micron mesh bag you're going to have all this goo that came out. Scrape that up. That is your rosin
[29:20.440 --> 29:25.720]  that you want to dab. That is solventless and you can smoke that immediately and it's kind of safe
[29:25.720 --> 29:29.880]  to make. If you can enjoy the flavor and you can get it the way you want it the temperature the
[29:29.880 --> 29:36.040]  pressure just with a few simple tools you can make dabble rosin at home from flowers. Now what a lot
[29:36.040 --> 29:41.560]  of people do they will take some hash some water hash some bubble hash maybe it was some ice wax at
[29:41.560 --> 29:47.640]  one point and they will press that into rosin and that makes really good rosin. The rosin that comes
[29:47.640 --> 29:51.240]  out of that once it's already been cleaned and you're not pressing all that plant matter and
[29:51.240 --> 29:56.840]  you're pressing water hash into rosin that makes delicious rosin. That's the best rosin I think you
[29:56.840 --> 30:02.680]  can make when you press hash into rosin. So shout out to our solventless friends. I hope I did you
[30:02.680 --> 30:07.080]  guys justice. Honestly I don't smoke a lot of solventless. If you want to come on the show and
[30:07.080 --> 30:10.680]  talk about solventless and teach us about it you are more than welcome. Send me an email it's
[30:10.680 --> 30:16.200]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com or if you're one of my friends text me or hit me up on the instagram
[30:16.200 --> 30:20.680]  and we can talk about that. Another type of concentrate I should mention but I am honestly
[30:20.680 --> 30:25.960]  not a big fan of is propane honey oil. Most of the concentrates I talked about before were made
[30:25.960 --> 30:30.600]  with butane and other techniques. There is you'll see pho on the shelves when you shop at the
[30:30.600 --> 30:36.360]  dispensary that is propane honey oil. Yes we are making concentrates with different gases. Different
[30:36.360 --> 30:40.680]  gases or different temperatures they will bring out different cannabinoids. I've noticed that the
[30:40.680 --> 30:46.920]  pho really brings out good flavors but it makes my lungs feel really heavy when I smoke it. It makes
[30:46.920 --> 30:52.920]  everything come out kind of waxy. It's kind of got that uh cheesecake batter sort of a texture to it
[30:52.920 --> 30:57.400]  and it doesn't taste too bad but it really makes my lungs heavy and it doesn't have the proper high.
[30:57.400 --> 31:01.160]  I don't enjoy the high to pho so that's another thing that I should mention is available.
[31:01.800 --> 31:07.560]  So you guys we went from smoking doo-doo just seven or eight years ago. We were smoking crap.
[31:08.200 --> 31:12.360]  Just just the muckiest crappiest stuff. It would be different colors. It'd be brown. It would be
[31:12.360 --> 31:16.920]  black. It would sizzle on the nail. It would give you a headache sometimes. It would make your throat
[31:16.920 --> 31:24.280]  burn and now the concentrate that I've got in my hand is super super clear. I can see my finger
[31:24.280 --> 31:28.760]  through the bottom of the jar and there are just little little diamonds sitting in here. It's not
[31:28.760 --> 31:33.640]  the same color but I want to compare this to the beauty of a little hot cocoa with little marshmallows
[31:33.640 --> 31:37.160]  on the top. You know those little little tiny marshmallows? That's what these little diamonds
[31:37.160 --> 31:41.960]  look like in here and they're just cascaded throughout this little little terp sauce and it
[31:41.960 --> 31:49.320]  smells wonderful. It smells like orange candies and jet fuel. It's so delicious. This is the Reba
[31:49.400 --> 31:55.320]  Jam from Green Dot Labs. So guys we went from smoking crap to smoking the best stuff on the
[31:55.320 --> 32:01.080]  planet in just a few years and that's because of legalization. So that is the evolution of the dabs.
[32:01.080 --> 32:06.600]  Now let's talk about some of the dab equipment. Let's talk about nails. At first I talked about
[32:06.600 --> 32:11.240]  the skillet. That's that upside down bong bowl with the piece that swings underneath it and then
[32:11.240 --> 32:14.360]  you heat that piece you swing it under there and you set your dab on there and hope it doesn't run
[32:14.360 --> 32:18.360]  off of there onto your leg while it's still hot because that's happened and it's fucking hot and
[32:18.360 --> 32:26.680]  it sucks. So we started off with the skillet then we learned to use a nail. Now a nail you had to
[32:26.680 --> 32:33.400]  have a male rig. Most so if you've got a bong it's probably a female. Your bong bowl fits into the
[32:33.400 --> 32:38.600]  stem right? Now imagine if that stem were the male part and the bowl fit on the outside that would be
[32:38.600 --> 32:44.120]  called a direct inject bowl is what that is. If you had a direct inject bowl that's a male you
[32:44.120 --> 32:51.000]  just set the dab nail right in there. They made a dab nail. It kind of looks like a big nail. It
[32:51.000 --> 32:55.640]  would be excuse me it's a titanium hopefully titanium you want a quality titanium nail you
[32:55.640 --> 32:58.600]  don't want to smoke some Chinese stuff because you're going to heat it up it's going to off gas
[32:58.600 --> 33:02.840]  I'm not going to rant about that but a titanium nail I recommend highly educated titanium. So you
[33:02.840 --> 33:08.600]  get a titanium nail it is kind of a it looks like a nail it's got a head on it and then it's got a
[33:08.600 --> 33:11.960]  long body right but it would have another piece on it that would screw up and down and make it
[33:11.960 --> 33:16.200]  adjustable so you could adjust the height that piece would sit and so you drop it right into the
[33:16.200 --> 33:21.400]  male part of the rig and you'd adjust that nail to where it would fit into the rig and stick out
[33:21.400 --> 33:26.360]  enough to where then you would slide a dome over it so you would heat the nail then you would slide
[33:26.360 --> 33:31.960]  a dome just like you would put your bowl onto the bong you would slide a dome over that nail and it
[33:31.960 --> 33:36.440]  would fit over there and the purpose of that is then you would take your dab and touch that hot
[33:36.440 --> 33:40.840]  nail with it and the smoke would kind of stay it would be trapped in that dome and then you would
[33:40.840 --> 33:45.080]  smoke through the bong or the bubble or whatever you're using and you would hit it that way so we
[33:45.080 --> 33:51.720]  went from the skillet to the nail and dome method. The nail was a little archaic but it worked very
[33:51.720 --> 33:55.720]  well I would see a lot of people try to carve the nail and burn the shit out of themselves.
[33:56.360 --> 34:00.520]  It took a little while for people to catch on to the nail tech it took a long time to teach people
[34:00.520 --> 34:04.840]  not to heat the fuck out of their nail I still take a pretty hot dab back in the day everybody
[34:04.840 --> 34:09.240]  was going even hotter than me we had to teach people to mellow down on that some people still
[34:09.240 --> 34:13.320]  don't want to hear it including myself I guess so you had the nail with the dome on it you're
[34:13.320 --> 34:19.160]  probably familiar with that then TaskRock started making different types of nails and he made
[34:19.160 --> 34:25.000]  the flux nail the flux was my favorite check out the flux nail by highly educated when I used a
[34:25.000 --> 34:32.360]  domed nail the flux was my go-to but then TASK came out with the domeless nail so the domeless nail
[34:33.480 --> 34:38.600]  kind of looked like a rook from a chess set you guys it looked like the rook on a chess set and I
[34:38.600 --> 34:43.560]  got to write something down here because I didn't write down carb cap the carb cap changed a lot of
[34:43.560 --> 34:49.800]  stuff when it came to dabbing I didn't write that down so the domeless nail kind of looked like you
[34:49.800 --> 34:56.440]  took a rook and set it right on your pipe right on your rig it was shaped like it tapered it was
[34:56.440 --> 35:01.880]  wider at the bottom and it tapered up and then it had this wide head on it with like a dish with a
[35:01.880 --> 35:07.000]  piece up at the in the center of the dish it looked like it kind of had an axle that was hollow so it
[35:07.000 --> 35:13.960]  had a dish you could drop your dab in but the center had a a wall around it so that your dab
[35:13.960 --> 35:17.560]  wouldn't fall right down the hole but you could smoke and the smoke would go up and then down
[35:17.560 --> 35:21.080]  that hole through the rig and you could hit it I think I described that accurately imagine you took
[35:21.080 --> 35:24.840]  a rook from a chess set drill the hole right through the top of it and set that motherfucker
[35:24.840 --> 35:28.120]  right on top of your nail that's kind of what it looked like but if you dropped your nail right on
[35:28.120 --> 35:30.920]  there it would fall through the hole in the middle right so they just put a little ring around that
[35:30.920 --> 35:36.280]  so it didn't fall through now you got yourself a dish with a hole you'd smoke on there now that
[35:36.280 --> 35:40.440]  was cool but you had to heat that thing real hot to hit it and you would put your dab on there and
[35:40.440 --> 35:44.680]  part of the smoke would get away and then you'd choke a lot because it was so hot so TASC invented
[35:44.680 --> 35:50.920]  a thing called a carb cap a carb cap was another piece of titanium that fit perfectly on top of
[35:50.920 --> 35:58.040]  your domeless nail now that carb cap would trap the heat inside of your nail and it would minimize
[35:58.040 --> 36:04.520]  the amount of outside air that was allowed to pass the surface of that nail which would stoke the
[36:04.520 --> 36:09.560]  heat of the nail and make your dab burn better at a lower temperature so now you were getting a
[36:09.560 --> 36:14.520]  better flavored dab because you weren't burning off the turps it wasn't burning your lungs it
[36:14.520 --> 36:18.840]  wasn't burning your throat and you didn't have to use so much heat to get all of your smoke you
[36:18.840 --> 36:22.840]  would drop a big old dab on there and you'd cap it and that heat would remain inside the nail because
[36:22.840 --> 36:26.120]  it was covered and then you could just keep pulling on it until you get all of it otherwise
[36:26.120 --> 36:30.440]  you had to heat it real hot and just try to get as much smoke as you could to try to take a big dab
[36:30.520 --> 36:36.760]  and part of the carb cap evolved from people were taking a domeless nail and placing their thumb or
[36:36.760 --> 36:41.640]  two fingers over the whole of the dome to kind of minimize and restrict the amount of airflow to get
[36:41.640 --> 36:46.680]  a lower temperature dab is kind of what inspired the carb cap so we went from the domed nail to
[36:46.680 --> 36:53.480]  the domeless nail to the dome domeless nail with a carb cap then somewhere along that point
[36:54.200 --> 37:00.840]  task rock invented the e-nail the e-nail was a domeless nail with a coil coming off of it that
[37:00.840 --> 37:07.640]  had a wire that went to a box that would regulate the temperature of that coil that would heat that
[37:07.640 --> 37:12.600]  nail so you didn't have to use a torch to heat your dab nail anymore it was electric and it was
[37:12.600 --> 37:16.360]  always running you'd plug that son of a bitch in you'd dial it to a temperature you'd wait a couple
[37:16.360 --> 37:20.440]  of minutes for it to heat up once it's hot it's going to be hot until you turn it off so you could
[37:20.440 --> 37:24.440]  take a dab i could pass it to kevin kevin would take a dab we'd pass it over to dd would take a
[37:24.440 --> 37:28.840]  dab and pass it back to me and i'd take another dab and he'd realize oh my goodness this thing is
[37:28.840 --> 37:34.360]  going to be a problem and everybody got so stoned when the email started first coming around so
[37:34.360 --> 37:39.000]  shout out to our friend task rock for making the first email he gets credit for that you guys he
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.320]  gets the first email there have been a lot of companies that have made a lot of emails after
[37:43.320 --> 37:49.320]  that but task did it first so shout out to task rock and the email um somewhere along the line so
[37:49.320 --> 37:56.600]  the email got popular then we started seeing things called the banger and the club banger the
[37:56.600 --> 38:01.320]  quav banger quave banger you can say quaver quave i'm not sure how you say it i've been corrected
[38:01.320 --> 38:05.560]  both ways so go with whichever one you're comfortable with but this dude quave made a
[38:05.560 --> 38:13.320]  thing called a banger it was probably the most commonly seen dabbing nail after the original
[38:13.320 --> 38:18.920]  titanium nail it's the one you see the most the one most copied the most knocked off it fits on
[38:18.920 --> 38:24.600]  your rig and it comes up and then it has an angle to where it gets horizontal it's either got a 45
[38:24.600 --> 38:31.080]  or a 90 degree angle probably on it to where that the dish part sits horizontally then it's just
[38:31.080 --> 38:36.760]  basically got a glass thimble on it and you heat it and you drop your dab in there and then you
[38:36.760 --> 38:41.000]  smoke it and you put a carb cap over it and then let me write down bubble caps too because we
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.440]  didn't talk about bubble caps because when we get to these other things we're going to need a bubble
[38:44.440 --> 38:52.280]  cap so basically the banger looks like a piece of glass at an angle that attaches to your rig or
[38:52.280 --> 38:56.440]  your pipe with a thimble on it and then you would heat that and when it got to the right temperature
[38:56.440 --> 39:01.240]  you drop your dab inside of there put a carb cap on it and at this point in time a carb cap was
[39:01.240 --> 39:05.400]  just a flat piece with a hole in it so that you could restrict the air then we started getting
[39:05.400 --> 39:08.760]  directional carb caps it would have a little piece of glass that would just point the air in a certain
[39:08.760 --> 39:12.520]  direction and you would turn it to move the oil around in your nail a little better because people
[39:12.520 --> 39:18.600]  were taking big dabs so that was the kind of the start of the club banger is what they called it
[39:18.600 --> 39:25.160]  the glass version of a nail from the banger we started seeing variations of that we saw the
[39:25.160 --> 39:31.480]  gavel from uh highly educated we saw the trough from who made the trough um i can't think of who
[39:31.480 --> 39:36.120]  made the trough right now joe peters then we saw the joel halen honey hole which was very similar
[39:36.120 --> 39:42.280]  to the trough uh we saw the grail from toro then we saw the core reactor which was kind of these
[39:42.280 --> 39:48.760]  are all just variations on the uh on the original banger and they're just slightly different but the
[39:48.760 --> 39:54.360]  core reactor was bigger and it had a piece like a hump of glass in the middle of it that would hold
[39:54.360 --> 39:59.240]  a little bit of heat longer so you could take larger dabs at lower temperatures it was just
[39:59.240 --> 40:04.200]  like a banger just like the coif banger but it had a larger chunk of glass in the very middle of it
[40:04.200 --> 40:10.600]  that would hold the heat so that was the core reactor then we started seeing the thermal banger
[40:10.600 --> 40:14.280]  which i'm going to try to describe to you now i've got one in front of me it's what i've been hitting
[40:14.280 --> 40:19.240]  it is just like the normal banger so you've got the joint that fits onto my rig it just sets right
[40:19.240 --> 40:24.840]  on the rig like a bong bowl would then it's got a 90 degree angle then it's got it looks like a glass
[40:24.840 --> 40:29.640]  thimble honestly just a piece of just a glass looks like a little glass jar or a glass thimble
[40:29.640 --> 40:36.360]  or a glass pepsi lid from a pepsi bottle it's about that size and it is attached to this glass
[40:37.080 --> 40:44.680]  90 degree angle then inside of that is another glass dish that looks like a smaller thimble so
[40:44.680 --> 40:50.120]  it's like a thimble inside of a thimble and the idea is that you heat the outer thimble and the
[40:50.120 --> 40:54.680]  heat never touches that inside thimble so it doesn't get dirty and funky and you don't burn your
[40:54.680 --> 41:00.120]  dab as bad so you heat the outside part you drop your dab in there then you put a bubble cap over
[41:00.120 --> 41:06.440]  it a bubble cap is shaped it's a bubble with a piece of tubing so imagine you took a straw and
[41:06.440 --> 41:09.960]  heated it and you blew on it and it expanded in the middle and you put a bubble in it that's what
[41:09.960 --> 41:14.840]  a bubble cap would look like then you cut it off short on both ends so part of that the bubble
[41:14.840 --> 41:19.160]  seals the cat the banger so now it's sealed off you drop the bubble cap on there it's sealed
[41:19.160 --> 41:24.280]  one end of it points down inside of the banger and one end of it points up and you turn it and
[41:24.280 --> 41:28.120]  when you turn it that moves your oil around inside there and it gets nice and deep inside of the
[41:28.120 --> 41:32.520]  banger so it moves that oil around inside the bottom of the banger so your oil moves and doesn't
[41:32.520 --> 41:37.960]  stay in one place and it burns the whole dab and you get a nice low temp dab that tastes really
[41:37.960 --> 41:45.480]  nice so that is and you also use that carb cap on the the core reactor banger so that is kind of the
[41:45.480 --> 41:50.600]  evolution of we went from the titanium the skillet to the nail to the flux to the domeless to the
[41:50.600 --> 41:57.640]  enail then we started using bangers and yes they do make so bangers are glass or quartz if you're
[41:57.640 --> 42:04.360]  paying like 20 or 30 bucks they're glass if you're paying 180 150 they're probably quartz i hope you
[42:04.360 --> 42:09.720]  can get a quartz enail you can get a banger with an enail attachment yes that is a thing
[42:09.720 --> 42:14.040]  i really appreciate that i enjoy the way that works the way that tastes and the way that dabs
[42:15.240 --> 42:19.240]  so we've talked about the core reactor we talked about the thermal banger we talked about the
[42:19.240 --> 42:23.800]  gavel the trough the grail those are just different versions you guys from different makers
[42:24.040 --> 42:30.440]  let's talk about the bucket the bucket is what mothership uses the bucket fits it looks like a
[42:30.440 --> 42:34.600]  bong bowl it looks just like you're gonna pack a bong bowl but it's got this little hinge on it
[42:34.600 --> 42:39.080]  and that hinge has a piece that swings out and it's got a little titanium dish on there
[42:39.080 --> 42:44.120]  you swing it out you heat that titanium dish you swing it back in and when it cools to the proper
[42:44.120 --> 42:49.640]  temp then you drop your dab on there and then you use what's called the ofz is what the carb cap is
[42:49.640 --> 42:56.600]  that fits on the mothership bucket there's also this new thing called the knot i'm not sure what
[42:56.600 --> 43:01.720]  it's actually called it looks like a pretzel knot it is ridiculous it looks like the hat you draw
[43:01.720 --> 43:05.560]  you heat it then you drop in this other thing and then you put your dab and you heat another thing
[43:05.560 --> 43:09.960]  and drop that inside of it and it looks like the hash falls to the bottom and keeps recycling up
[43:09.960 --> 43:15.880]  to the top i am not familiar with it granny does not like it there's another thing from toro that
[43:15.880 --> 43:20.520]  kind of looks like a bird feeder i'm pretty sure that's from toro i've never tried that it doesn't
[43:20.520 --> 43:27.320]  look uh it just doesn't look like it makes sense to me it looks like i would rather dab off of a
[43:27.320 --> 43:31.880]  banger uh you guys will see that one online the one you drop the dab in the top and then it falls
[43:31.880 --> 43:36.040]  to the bottom somehow and it looks it's shaped like a fucking coal what coleman lantern it looks
[43:36.040 --> 43:40.600]  like a bird feeder or something i'm not a fan of that thing i haven't used it but still it just
[43:40.600 --> 43:44.680]  looks like it's more cumbersome than it's worth it looks like a pain in the ass and it doesn't
[43:44.680 --> 43:52.120]  make sense to me uh also there are insert dabs insert dabs kind of you have a a bigger banger
[43:52.920 --> 43:58.760]  and then you heat the bigger banger and then you put your dab inside of a smaller like a just a
[43:58.760 --> 44:04.360]  glass dish and you actually set that inside of the banger and then you put a carb cap on there
[44:04.360 --> 44:10.280]  and then you give it a second for the heat to work its way to your dab and then you toke on it and
[44:10.280 --> 44:14.360]  that way you can just pull out that little dish when you're done the insert and you can clean that
[44:14.360 --> 44:19.400]  dish off and you have a clean nice turpy dab every time it always tastes delicious and it
[44:19.400 --> 44:24.200]  always tastes fresh because a lot of people don't want to smoke off of a burnt out chased banger if
[44:24.200 --> 44:28.520]  your banger is all black and funky looking and needs some attention that's called it's chased
[44:28.520 --> 44:32.520]  and you kind of fucked it up and a lot of hash snubs are not going to want to smoke off of that
[44:32.520 --> 44:37.720]  with you so that's most of the bangers and nail styles that i can think of right now i'm sure i
[44:37.720 --> 44:41.720]  missed a couple i'm sure something has come out since i've made this episode i'm sure i'm not on
[44:41.720 --> 44:46.520]  top of everything but that's a lot of what you're going to see also we've got nectar collectors
[44:46.520 --> 44:51.560]  nectar collectors are kind of like a rig but instead of dropping the dab into the nail you
[44:51.560 --> 44:56.760]  heat up the tip of the nectar collector and you put your concentrate into a dish and the nectar
[44:56.760 --> 45:02.600]  collector is made to be held vertically so it's up and down and you hold the dish in your hand
[45:02.600 --> 45:05.640]  and then you kind of smoke it like an anteater you look like an anteater it's like you're using
[45:05.640 --> 45:10.440]  a giant straw just to suck up a dab you heat up the tip of it and you press that hot tip up against
[45:10.440 --> 45:15.160]  the dab and you get a huge dab out of that a lot of people love a nectar collector it's like
[45:15.160 --> 45:21.000]  basically a dab straw that runs through water a dab straw is just a piece of glass that's tapered at
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.920]  one end you heat up that one end real hot you press that up against your dabs and you suck
[45:24.920 --> 45:29.240]  through the other end it's a way to take a dab but it's really hot and it's really uncomfortable
[45:29.240 --> 45:35.000]  for me a nectar collector is a very upgraded way to do that because it filters your dab through
[45:35.000 --> 45:39.640]  water i always prefer my dab to go through water to cool it down a little bit for me
[45:40.440 --> 45:46.040]  i guess that's a good way to segue into rig selection i prefer a small rig there's no reason
[45:46.040 --> 45:50.920]  to smoke your dabs out of a big ass bong you're not so let's think about the reason you're smoking
[45:50.920 --> 45:57.160]  through a bong you pack a bowl you light that bowl you've got a big 12 18 two foot bong right
[45:57.160 --> 46:02.040]  your 24 inch bong you're smoking you fill that big ass chamber with all that thick smoke you can see
[46:02.040 --> 46:06.200]  that cloud coming out it's coming up at you you're looking at it through the tube like all that smoke
[46:06.200 --> 46:10.200]  is about to go into my head and then once you get it all filled up with as much as you think you can
[46:10.200 --> 46:14.520]  handle you pull that carb and you suck all that smoke in and you get that loud water noise
[46:15.960 --> 46:19.240]  and you try not to splash it up on your face and you get a big old bong hit you cough
[46:20.200 --> 46:23.320]  and then you put the bowl back in there and you pass it to your friend you're like i'm fucking
[46:23.320 --> 46:28.760]  stoned bong hits feel great that's a great thing i love a giant bong hit but i don't want to take a
[46:28.760 --> 46:34.360]  dab out of a big old bong hit because as soon if i heat the nail as soon as that dab touches the
[46:34.360 --> 46:39.880]  nail i carb cap it and i'm starting to get smoke already the smoke is coming there's no need to
[46:39.880 --> 46:47.400]  start filling a chamber i don't want to suck 12 inches 18 or 24 inches of glass of air of oxygen
[46:47.400 --> 46:51.640]  to my lungs before i even get my dab i'm not trying to smoke a gallon of air i'm trying to
[46:51.640 --> 46:57.160]  smoke a gram of concentrates so i don't need a big bong i want a little tiny piece i like what
[46:57.160 --> 47:02.600]  they call a sidecar the rig i'm hitting right now is made by hitman hitman doesn't sponsor the show
[47:02.600 --> 47:07.480]  a lot of people hate on hitman i like the way this rig functions i could it doesn't matter to me who
[47:07.480 --> 47:15.400]  made this i like the way this rig hits this rig is probably five inches tall it's about the size
[47:15.400 --> 47:20.600]  around it's the size around of my torch it's almost the same diameter of my torch it's like
[47:20.600 --> 47:25.000]  perfectly the size it fits right in a cup holder you guys the base of this fits right in a cup
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.000]  holder i didn't say that but it fits right in a cup holder okay it's a little smaller than the
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.320]  diameter of a pepsi can it's a little thicker around than my torch it fits really nice in a
[47:33.320 --> 47:37.800]  cup holder it's about four inches tall then it's got a little mouthpiece coming off it's just a can
[47:37.800 --> 47:41.960]  shape they call that a can and it's got a mouthpiece coming off of it that's another four
[47:41.960 --> 47:47.000]  or five inches long and that mouthpiece i like a nice flared out mouthpiece so that my lips fit
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.120]  into it and i don't have to make that that blowjob mouth to try to take a dab also i don't like a
[47:52.120 --> 47:55.880]  skinny mouthpiece because i take big dabs and i feel like when you take a big dab with a skinny
[47:55.880 --> 48:00.360]  mouthpiece and you got a mustache like i do a lot of concentrate just gathers right there in your
[48:00.360 --> 48:04.280]  mustache and it's kind of funky to have sticky lips you guys have heard me do podcasts with
[48:04.280 --> 48:09.640]  sticky lips from small mouthpiece rigs so then it's got a male joint sticking straight up off
[48:09.640 --> 48:16.200]  the top the very center the main portion of this rig is just shaped like a circle or a can it's
[48:16.200 --> 48:20.280]  just a can it's a small can so then i described the mouthpiece now right on the top and the dead
[48:20.280 --> 48:26.840]  center of that can is where the male joint sticks up and on that joint i have got a it's a 14 inch
[48:26.840 --> 48:32.040]  joint and i've got a 14 inch uh thermal banger on there and i'm using a bubble cap tonight so
[48:32.040 --> 48:35.720]  that's basically my dab setup and i'm using a little just a glass pencil as a dabber from
[48:35.720 --> 48:40.760]  tater glass shout out to tater i prefer a small rig you guys nothing too big something that's
[48:40.760 --> 48:45.240]  kind of like hand size you don't want anything much bigger than that there's no need to smoke
[48:45.240 --> 48:50.600]  a gallon of oxygen before your dab gets to you so a little rig is best in my opinion a little side
[48:50.600 --> 48:54.680]  car is best uh let's see what else do i want to mention we're getting close to an hour and i've
[48:54.680 --> 48:59.640]  still got a few notes that i want to make sure let's talk about the evolution of rigs when rigs
[48:59.640 --> 49:04.920]  first came out most of them had what was known as an 18 millimeter joint that joint was 18
[49:04.920 --> 49:09.000]  millimeters around it's kind of a big joint the way that i used to remember the size of that one
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.680]  if i went to the store to go shopping and they didn't know the difference in the 14 or the 18
[49:12.680 --> 49:17.080]  that was the one that kind of fits right over the tip of my pinky finger that's the 18 millimeter
[49:17.080 --> 49:23.320]  joint then we went a little smaller we went to 14 millimeter joints 14 millimeter is about the size
[49:23.320 --> 49:28.760]  around of a big pen without the cap so if you can just fit your big pen in there that's probably a
[49:28.760 --> 49:35.240]  14 millimeter joint there you got a 14 millimeter male or female joint then everybody wanted to go
[49:35.240 --> 49:40.280]  smaller everybody thought that a little tiny teeny tiny rig was best so people started going with 10
[49:40.280 --> 49:45.960]  millimeter those are really tiny a pin won't fit in there you got to clean that down stem out with
[49:45.960 --> 49:51.880]  a q-tip if you want to clean it so we evolved from 18 to 14 to 10 and then i think most of the people
[49:51.880 --> 49:57.160]  went back to a 10 or to a 14 is about where we stayed the 10 got clogged up and you can't take a
[49:57.160 --> 50:02.520]  giant dab off a 10 mil rig in my opinion someone's gonna argue with me but i don't like doing it i'd
[50:02.520 --> 50:08.840]  rather have a 14 that's my preferred size 18 that's not bad you just get a lot of airflow a little
[50:08.840 --> 50:15.160]  restriction on the airflow is not bad but i don't want that 10 mil so we went from 18 to 14 to 10
[50:15.160 --> 50:20.920]  i think that kind of covers a lot of the evolution of rigs you guys rigs can be anywhere from 30
[50:21.560 --> 50:27.400]  to 30 000 i've seen a hundred and one thousand dollar rig before so get what suits you don't
[50:27.400 --> 50:31.480]  be out there trying to impress people with your rig get what works this rig i'm hitting out of
[50:31.480 --> 50:37.080]  right now was 150 to a lot of people you're gonna say holy shit that's expensive a lot of people out
[50:37.080 --> 50:40.040]  there are gonna go really bro that's all you're smoking out of your roster jeff you're hitting
[50:40.040 --> 50:46.440]  150 hit man yeah it works perfectly this rig has a perfect perk inside of it i like the way it
[50:46.440 --> 50:50.520]  percolates i like the way it fits on my face it's comfortable i like holding it i like the way it
[50:50.520 --> 50:54.360]  goes in my hand the way it fits to my hand to my face when i'm dabbing i don't have to reach
[50:54.360 --> 50:59.320]  awkwardly i like this rig it doesn't splash in my mouth get a rig that's comfortable for you
[50:59.320 --> 51:03.240]  don't buy something to impress your friends uh don't get something that splashes water up in
[51:03.240 --> 51:06.600]  your mouth don't get something that you got to get all cross-eyed trying to take a hit out of get a
[51:06.600 --> 51:11.800]  rig that's comfortable for you one more thing i want to rant on and then we are going to wrap up
[51:11.800 --> 51:17.400]  this hour-long 710 episode of this podcast you guys a lot of people ask me what temp do you set
[51:17.400 --> 51:23.960]  your email at i like to set my temp on my email at what works for me i can't make a recommendation
[51:23.960 --> 51:29.800]  for you because you've got a different unit than me you've got a different box that box is sending
[51:29.800 --> 51:35.880]  a frequency up that cable to that coil to the top of your nail there's no way that that box knows
[51:35.880 --> 51:41.000]  what the temperature is on the top of your nail so setting that number on your box is just like
[51:41.000 --> 51:45.480]  setting the number of volume on your car stereo you find where it sounds really good i know that
[51:45.480 --> 51:51.240]  in my car stereo about 24 25 sounds pretty nice when i start hitting 26 it gets kind of crackly
[51:51.240 --> 51:57.000]  27 28 sounds like shit it's not even worth going there so i rock about 23 24 all the time find
[51:57.000 --> 52:02.520]  where your dab temperature is comfortable with your dab nail maybe you got to go to 500 maybe
[52:02.520 --> 52:07.560]  at 500 the dab's not melting properly maybe you got to go to 600 maybe at 6 it's still not going
[52:07.560 --> 52:13.000]  maybe you got to go to 700 maybe around 7 or 800 it starts to burn right where you want it dial it
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.320]  in it may take you a few dabs it may cost you a couple of grams to get that email dialed in
[52:17.320 --> 52:21.800]  but i can't recommend a number for you i could say start at a certain number and then dial up
[52:21.800 --> 52:27.160]  or down from there but you kind of have to dial it in to the way that you like it so that's my rant
[52:27.160 --> 52:31.800]  on dialing in your email temperature we don't all have the same unit we don't all have the same box
[52:31.800 --> 52:36.600]  we don't all have the same nail and we're not all dabbing the same stuff so dial it into the way
[52:36.600 --> 52:41.240]  that you like it maybe you want that dab and use a carb cap always use a carb cap it's going to help
[52:41.240 --> 52:45.560]  you out dial it into her when you drop that dab on there it starts to melt a little bit and put
[52:45.560 --> 52:50.120]  the carb cap on there and give a good draw through it if you're not getting any smoke turn it up a
[52:50.120 --> 52:55.080]  little bit if you're getting way too hot way too thick too fast turn it down you'll figure it out
[52:55.080 --> 52:59.800]  it'll only take a few dabs to get yourself in the right ballpark and then you can dial it in and get
[52:59.800 --> 53:04.200]  it perfect from there and then just remember the number here's here's a quick idea that i just
[53:04.200 --> 53:08.360]  thought of maybe if you're dabbing and you've got an email you've probably been dabbing off a normal
[53:08.360 --> 53:13.400]  nail before heat that nail up heat it up and then feel it with your hand and when you go that's where
[53:13.400 --> 53:18.680]  i want to be that's where i would normally dab get your email and plug it in and heat that fucker up
[53:18.680 --> 53:22.760]  and play with it put your hand up to it and when they feel about the same you're kind of close in
[53:22.760 --> 53:26.440]  the right ballpark right so get it to the same temperature that you would heat it with your torch
[53:26.440 --> 53:29.960]  and it's a different nail keep in mind it's a different nail it's a different nail surface it
[53:29.960 --> 53:34.360]  could be a different kind of metal it could be one could be a banger one could be quartz one
[53:34.360 --> 53:38.520]  could be glass and now you could be messing with the titanium email keep in mind that you're going
[53:38.520 --> 53:42.520]  to have different surfaces to work with but heat one up with the torch and then plug in that email
[53:42.520 --> 53:46.680]  and dial it in and see if you can get them close if you can get that email to the familiar feeling
[53:46.680 --> 53:50.280]  of how you would do it with the torch that's where you want it drop a dab on there hit it
[53:50.840 --> 53:54.600]  see if it works for you you can always turn it up or down that's not going to be your last dab
[53:54.600 --> 53:58.840]  hopefully hopefully you got plenty more dabs coming your way you got plenty of time to dial it in
[53:58.840 --> 54:03.960]  so that's my rant on email temperature you guys a lot of people ask me what temp to set the email at
[54:04.120 --> 54:09.560]  I really don't know to tell you because I don't have your email and now that's a perfect segue
[54:09.560 --> 54:15.560]  into the next and final part of this podcast hot dabs versus low temp dabs a lot of people
[54:15.560 --> 54:19.720]  talk a lot of shit to me because I like to take really really hot dabs that's just my thing
[54:19.720 --> 54:24.600]  I take bigger dabs in the average person also I feel like to take the big dab that I need I need a
[54:24.600 --> 54:29.160]  little extra heat when I put that oil onto the nail it immediately starts cooling the nail I'm
[54:29.160 --> 54:33.880]  not using an email I like to use a quartz banger heat it with a torch so as soon as something
[54:33.880 --> 54:39.080]  hits it before something hits it when I quit applying heat it starts cooling I let it get
[54:39.640 --> 54:43.960]  kind of cooler it's still pretty hot then I put my dab on there that rapidly starts cooling it
[54:43.960 --> 54:48.360]  I've got to get my carb cap on there and start swirling it around a lot of times the nail cools
[54:48.360 --> 54:53.240]  before I get to consume all of the dab so I've got to go a little bit hotter that's just the way I
[54:53.240 --> 54:57.560]  like it when you go a little hotter you also get this little punch in the chest from it it's just
[54:57.560 --> 55:03.080]  a little extra a lot of kids like to go a little low temp they don't mind wasting a little bit they
[55:03.080 --> 55:07.880]  get a q-tip and they clean out the banger when they're done that's not my style so if you like
[55:07.880 --> 55:13.000]  low temp dabs they say you get more flavor out of it I may agree with that if that's your thing
[55:13.000 --> 55:17.560]  go for it if you're all about the hot dabs if that's your thing go for it just don't go so hot
[55:17.560 --> 55:22.120]  that you cause yourself health problems you guys be careful I know I joke around we talk about
[55:22.120 --> 55:27.240]  glowies and glow squad and we say red means go that's kind of an exaggeration don't fuck your
[55:27.240 --> 55:31.720]  health up because of a hot dab be careful you'll notice one day you'll take too hot of a dab you'll
[55:32.120 --> 55:35.800]  you'll get in a hurry you'll get impatient you'll heat it up you'll have your dab ready you'll be
[55:35.800 --> 55:40.280]  talking and you'll go in and you'll go oh fuck I didn't wait it'll be so hot just learn to time
[55:40.280 --> 55:44.440]  your dabs heat it up let it cool till it's not scorching hot then hit your dab when it's
[55:44.440 --> 55:49.480]  comfortable for you how you like it don't worry about what anybody else thinks dab it your temperature
[55:50.120 --> 55:53.640]  all right you guys that's all I've got for this 710 episode thank you for hanging out with me
