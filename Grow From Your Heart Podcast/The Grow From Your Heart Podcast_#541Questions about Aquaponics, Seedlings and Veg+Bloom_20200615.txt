[00:52.440 --> 01:00.720]  I've got a little assortment of apothecary stuff, but what I've been hitting most is the Malibu Malibu pure kush.
[01:00.760 --> 01:02.960]  Talking is harder than it should be today.
[01:03.160 --> 01:04.000]  It is.
[01:04.480 --> 01:05.600]  We're going to get it figured out.
[01:05.600 --> 01:06.200]  It's the hash.
[01:06.440 --> 01:08.360]  Is that Malibu pure kush from apothecary?
[01:08.640 --> 01:09.240]  It is.
[01:09.280 --> 01:11.760]  I love that Malibu pure kush. That shit tastes so good.
[01:12.000 --> 01:13.160]  It's pretty tasty batter.
[01:13.840 --> 01:15.120]  You're all slow and mellow.
[01:16.120 --> 01:21.000]  I am over here dabbing the guava papaya live batter from green dot labs.
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.480]  It's a blend of chem four and papaya.
[01:23.840 --> 01:27.720]  The package says sour fuel and soft fruits.
[01:27.920 --> 01:28.680]  Uh, okay.
[01:29.640 --> 01:30.360]  I'll agree with that.
[01:30.440 --> 01:32.640]  It's a, it's like a sour fruity candy.
[01:32.640 --> 01:33.960]  I don't know about the fuel in there.
[01:33.960 --> 01:35.360]  I don't really get the fuel.
[01:35.360 --> 01:35.920]  Most of the time.
[01:35.920 --> 01:36.400]  I agree.
[01:36.600 --> 01:43.480]  But a sour fruity candies, almost like a, a sour patch with the, the powdery sugar on the outside where it's real crispy.
[01:43.480 --> 01:44.480]  You get the crumbly sugar.
[01:44.680 --> 01:49.120]  It's kind of got that kind of a flavor in my opinion, guava, papaya, live batter.
[01:49.360 --> 01:49.880]  Loving it.
[01:50.360 --> 01:52.000]  Uh, Mike is showing his package.
[01:52.240 --> 01:53.520]  Uh, that's not what I meant to say.
[01:53.520 --> 01:54.760]  The package of his concentrate.
[01:56.520 --> 01:57.400]  There's his concentrate.
[01:57.440 --> 01:58.440]  There's my concentrate.
[01:58.720 --> 02:00.040]  You guys take a dab with us.
[02:00.240 --> 02:01.360]  Don't get too excited.
[02:01.440 --> 02:02.320]  It's that's all right.
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.600]  Um, so audio listeners, that's a good segue.
[02:05.600 --> 02:10.320]  Mike, if you were listening to the show on audio, uh, I invite you to come join us on YouTube.
[02:10.320 --> 02:13.320]  I've been putting all of the shows up in a video format on YouTube.
[02:13.320 --> 02:14.640]  You can see my smile and face.
[02:14.640 --> 02:17.560]  You can see, uh, Mike's pasty, semi smile and face.
[02:17.560 --> 02:19.120]  You can see the concentrates we just showed.
[02:19.360 --> 02:20.320]  Join us on YouTube.
[02:20.520 --> 02:21.720]  Uh, search for grow from your heart.
[02:21.720 --> 02:22.440]  Click subscribe.
[02:22.680 --> 02:24.080]  Uh, click that notification bell.
[02:24.360 --> 02:28.160]  That way you can get a notification every time a new episode comes out, check us out on YouTube.
[02:28.320 --> 02:29.560]  Also, we have upgraded.
[02:29.560 --> 02:31.320]  We are on Spotify.
[02:31.640 --> 02:33.600]  Um, we have moved to the show to not move.
[02:33.600 --> 02:34.680]  We have added to Spotify.
[02:34.680 --> 02:39.400]  I had a couple of people ask if I'm going to Joe Rogan them and if I'm going to disappear on other platforms.
[02:39.400 --> 02:40.640]  No, we're going to Spotify.
[02:41.080 --> 02:43.880]  Also, because a lot of people only listen on Spotify.
[02:44.200 --> 02:46.160]  I'd like to expand the podcast, get it out there.
[02:46.160 --> 02:47.720]  I want everybody to be able to listen.
[02:48.000 --> 02:49.840]  It was silly to not have it on Spotify.
[02:49.880 --> 02:54.800]  There was a technical glitch that was not allowing my service to work with Spotify.
[02:54.800 --> 02:56.000]  And mine comes from my website.
[02:56.240 --> 02:57.440]  I had to make a correction.
[02:57.720 --> 02:59.840]  Uh, I thought of a very easy solution.
[02:59.840 --> 03:01.720]  It took me a night of brainstorming.
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.520]  It actually took about six dabs.
[03:03.720 --> 03:05.600]  And then I went, Oh, that's the fucking solution.
[03:05.600 --> 03:07.560]  And I did it and everything seems to be working.
[03:07.560 --> 03:11.520]  So we are on Spotify from 500 on up is on Spotify.
[03:11.520 --> 03:13.680]  Some of the episodes won't load into Spotify.
[03:13.680 --> 03:15.720]  I do not know why they have rejected them.
[03:16.120 --> 03:17.680]  The files are the correct files.
[03:17.960 --> 03:19.040]  The shows are good shows.
[03:19.440 --> 03:23.000]  Uh, I don't know if it's a copyright and music that I have selected.
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.880]  I don't know why, but a few of them got rejected.
[03:25.160 --> 03:27.120]  Uh, Spotify simply won't accept them to the feed.
[03:27.120 --> 03:27.680]  They won't play.
[03:27.680 --> 03:29.960]  So I apologize if you're missing a few on Spotify.
[03:30.240 --> 03:34.200]  The solution is to come over to YouTube and check us out on the YouTube channel.
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.440]  Um, yeah, that way you get to see Mike's smile and face.
[03:37.440 --> 03:40.160]  He's looking at me like Mike or Jeff's just rambling right now.
[03:40.160 --> 03:41.600]  I've got to wait for that part to be done.
[03:41.720 --> 03:43.200]  If you're not checking it out, no need to.
[03:43.880 --> 03:44.080]  Yeah.
[03:44.080 --> 03:45.160]  Come hang out with us on YouTube.
[03:45.160 --> 03:47.560]  It's, it's a, it's a more interactive experience.
[03:48.040 --> 03:50.920]  Um, so we are not going to leave any platforms, you guys, just
[03:50.920 --> 03:53.000]  cause we're on Spotify doesn't mean we're going away.
[03:53.040 --> 03:53.920]  I want you to join us.
[03:53.920 --> 03:56.800]  Unless they offer us like a lot of money.
[03:57.320 --> 04:00.400]  They don't care about our little weed show, bro.
[04:00.440 --> 04:02.160]  If they want to make me rich, I'll help you.
[04:02.280 --> 04:03.360]  I'll talk you into selling out.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.320]  Um, we're going to get to getting rich in just a minute.
[04:06.400 --> 04:07.360]  What else was I going to say?
[04:07.400 --> 04:13.160]  Oh, speaking of Spotify, Spotify may be rejecting some of my episodes because
[04:13.160 --> 04:16.400]  of copywritten music and the start and end of certain shows.
[04:16.760 --> 04:20.960]  So once again, I will politely, calmly, and very cordially request that if any
[04:20.960 --> 04:23.960]  of my friends out there make music, if you were a producer, if you're a recorder,
[04:23.960 --> 04:27.480]  if you're an artist, if you're into making beats, bro, I need a good opening
[04:27.480 --> 04:29.400]  track, maybe a closing track for the show.
[04:29.720 --> 04:31.080]  Uh, you guys know, I like reggae.
[04:31.080 --> 04:31.960]  I'm a reggae fan.
[04:31.960 --> 04:33.680]  I used to play a song called the doggy dub.
[04:33.680 --> 04:35.040]  It comes in with a big fat beat.
[04:35.080 --> 04:37.280]  Just, it starts.
[04:37.280 --> 04:38.240]  It doesn't fuck around.
[04:38.640 --> 04:41.400]  Uh, something about 30 seconds, 45 seconds.
[04:42.000 --> 04:42.320]  Yeah.
[04:42.320 --> 04:45.000]  The good old days, maybe a minute and a half long, just some music.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  So I could say, what's up guys.
[04:46.000 --> 04:47.320]  It's this episode of the show.
[04:47.480 --> 04:48.120]  Welcome back.
[04:48.120 --> 04:49.200]  All that good, fancy shit.
[04:49.200 --> 04:50.400]  Seeds here now.com.
[04:50.600 --> 04:51.400]  Get all that in there.
[04:51.720 --> 04:55.240]  Uh, if you want to make me some music, if you are a professional and you require
[04:55.240 --> 04:57.040]  payment, send me a sample.
[04:57.080 --> 05:00.120]  And if I like your sample, I will pay you for the full track.
[05:00.120 --> 05:03.080]  If you were, uh, if you're just trying to do something for out of the kindness of
[05:03.080 --> 05:04.600]  your heart, that's kind of what I'm looking for.
[05:04.600 --> 05:05.520]  I would appreciate that.
[05:05.640 --> 05:06.560]  You still may get paid.
[05:06.560 --> 05:09.520]  You will definitely get a gift of some sort in return.
[05:09.840 --> 05:12.080]  I got to figure out where you are and what you want.
[05:12.320 --> 05:13.240]  I will take good care of you.
[05:13.920 --> 05:15.920]  Um, Mike said, getting rich.

[06:52.360 --> 06:52.560]  Yeah.
[06:52.640 --> 06:56.000]  Uh, it makes it, uh, it's kind of fun when you do a podcast that you enjoy doing
[06:56.200 --> 06:58.240]  and then people send you contributions for it.
[06:58.240 --> 06:59.200]  You're like, well, that's kind of cool.
[06:59.200 --> 07:00.200]  Like I did something I love.

[07:03.520 --> 07:03.960]  Right.
[07:04.320 --> 07:05.560]  That's definitely very cool.
[07:05.560 --> 07:06.280]  Thank you so much.
[07:06.600 --> 07:08.800]  Uh, they help keep all the equipment running smoothly.
[07:08.880 --> 07:10.760]  I've talked about all the gear that I've got going on.
[07:10.760 --> 07:14.080]  We've bought, I replaced the Mac book with Patriot on contributions.
[07:14.080 --> 07:17.160]  What time the Mac book started sparking and making fucking smoke.
[07:17.280 --> 07:19.760]  So I replaced it with Patriot on contributions.
[07:19.760 --> 07:21.320]  So that's what the Patriot on money does.
[07:21.600 --> 07:22.960]  Uh, it pays for the web connection.
[07:22.960 --> 07:23.960]  It pays for the website.
[07:24.200 --> 07:25.280]  I covers quite a few things.
[07:25.280 --> 07:28.240]  There's, we've got a backup fund in case anything goes wrong or
[07:28.280 --> 07:29.480]  if we try to do some upgrades.
[07:29.560 --> 07:30.240]  So thank you guys.
[07:30.240 --> 07:31.320]  You really are helping out.
[07:33.080 --> 07:33.240]  Yeah.
[07:33.240 --> 07:35.240]  Next purchase here is going to get me out of the void.
[07:35.320 --> 07:39.920]  So if you don't like the black void behind me, chip in, if you do comment,
[07:40.360 --> 07:40.960]  that's pretty good.
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.160]  They won't know what you mean until a couple episodes away, but
[07:43.440 --> 07:44.960]  get Mike out of the void.
[07:45.320 --> 07:45.720]  Yep.
[07:46.760 --> 07:48.040]  Uh, we covered all this stuff.
[07:48.040 --> 07:49.960]  I think all the important business stuff.
[07:50.520 --> 07:51.840]  Uh, Patriot killed it.
[07:52.120 --> 07:57.520]  I think it is time to work into the, uh, the, the, uh, the email
[07:57.520 --> 07:59.200]  portion of the show going to be about buddy.
[07:59.240 --> 07:59.480]  Yeah.
[07:59.480 --> 07:59.720]  Yeah.
[07:59.840 --> 08:01.640]  I was going to say, uh, they did very well.
[08:01.640 --> 08:04.160]  The folks did very well on my Patriot on this month.
[08:04.160 --> 08:05.800]  We're almost to another level.
[08:06.040 --> 08:09.040]  Uh, my number of things, my brain thinks in number of levels and increments.
[08:09.480 --> 08:15.360]  Uh, you guys, if we get to the next level, I would consider another podcast episode.
[08:16.320 --> 08:20.600]  Uh, maybe at least one more every other week, but if we could get it to the level,
[08:20.600 --> 08:24.840]  I'm thinking more content, more content, I would add another episode.
[08:24.840 --> 08:26.960]  I think, uh, give me faster.
[08:27.160 --> 08:30.920]  Yeah, I would, I would have to focus less on other things and I would just be able
[08:30.920 --> 08:33.800]  to, I would free up some more time for more podcast content.
[08:33.800 --> 08:36.360]  So if we get up to that next level, I may do another episode.
[08:36.360 --> 08:38.920]  And Mike was like, bro, what are you going to do for another episode every week?
[08:38.920 --> 08:40.080]  Where are you going to come up with content?
[08:40.080 --> 08:42.200]  And I said, have you seen the stack of emails, Mike?
[08:42.520 --> 08:45.160]  We have got emails that people are waiting.
[08:45.200 --> 08:47.040]  So, um, I'm rambling today.
[08:47.040 --> 08:48.640]  I took that dab of that guava papaya.
[08:48.640 --> 08:50.000]  It's been a long fucking day.
[08:50.240 --> 08:52.760]  Uh, truth be told, it is one in the morning, bro.
[08:53.440 --> 08:53.680]  Yeah.
[08:53.680 --> 08:54.480]  Your dad crushed you.
[08:54.480 --> 08:54.920]  I saw it.
[08:55.080 --> 08:55.480]  That's good.
[08:55.520 --> 08:55.800]  Yeah.
[08:56.640 --> 09:00.040]  Uh, it's one in the morning and we're here recording, uh, but we're going to kill it.
[09:00.280 --> 09:02.320]  Uh, let's get to the email portion of the podcast, Mike.
[09:02.320 --> 09:03.800]  Let's uh, let's help some people out.
[09:04.040 --> 09:06.040]  I've got a stack of emails here in front of me.
[09:06.640 --> 09:10.240]  The first email on today's episode goes to just like this.
[09:10.240 --> 09:14.160]  It is from somebody who called themselves I revives and it says hail up Rasta Jeff.
[09:14.160 --> 09:16.480]  I want to thank you for the great information I received
[09:16.480 --> 09:18.320]  from listening to your podcast.
[09:18.640 --> 09:22.560]  I've been growing everything from the late seventies in my homeland in Jamaica.
[09:22.800 --> 09:25.320]  Not just the Holy herb, but the food that I eat.
[09:25.640 --> 09:26.320]  That's awesome.
[09:26.320 --> 09:27.120]  Big respect for that.
[09:27.120 --> 09:29.120]  Big shout out to my friends on the Island of Jamaica.
[09:29.600 --> 09:34.640]  Uh, it says, uh, the only difference is I grow natural and no salts, but now
[09:34.640 --> 09:38.280]  that I have moved to the USA, I find it hard to do the same because
[09:38.280 --> 09:40.160]  the soil is not the same here.
[09:40.160 --> 09:40.320]  Yeah.
[09:40.320 --> 09:42.440]  We've, uh, we've kind of destroyed the soil.
[09:42.440 --> 09:45.920]  We don't have any, an agricultural mindset like in Jamaica and Jamaica.
[09:45.920 --> 09:47.520]  They're thinking about the future all the time.
[09:47.520 --> 09:50.560]  We're thinking about right now and maybe tomorrow.
[09:50.680 --> 09:53.320]  So the soil has been kind of tore up here a little bit.
[09:53.640 --> 09:54.520]  Uh, it's all urban.
[09:54.960 --> 09:56.520]  Uh, so notice the soil is different.
[09:56.520 --> 09:57.240]  Can't grow the same.
[09:57.240 --> 10:00.920]  So they decided to grow outdoor and use cocoa and Canada nudes, but was not
[10:00.920 --> 10:05.320]  getting what I know the plant could produce while I was growing in Jamaica.
[10:05.680 --> 10:09.880]  Now I was on a mission to get information from the top breeders and growers to
[10:09.880 --> 10:14.360]  see what they were using until I stumbled across the DGC, there we go.
[10:14.360 --> 10:17.320]  So they found me on the dude grows show.
[10:17.720 --> 10:20.480]  Uh, that's where they mentioned Rasta Jeff.
[10:20.480 --> 10:24.080]  So naturally, uh, because I'm a fan of the Island of Jamaica, I had to browse
[10:24.120 --> 10:26.320]  your podcast and thank jaw for the blessing.
[10:26.320 --> 10:26.600]  Yes.
[10:26.840 --> 10:27.280]  Give thanks.
[10:27.280 --> 10:28.160]  I'm glad you found me.
[10:28.400 --> 10:30.480]  Uh, I'm glad you are learning from the show.
[10:30.480 --> 10:31.200]  Big respect.
[10:31.480 --> 10:33.600]  But here's the part that we've got to cover.
[10:33.600 --> 10:38.720]  It says, uh, I have switched my nutrients from what I was using.
[10:38.800 --> 10:41.560]  I said, Canada, a minute ago, I wasn't going to say that, but I did say the
[10:41.560 --> 10:46.160]  reason can I switch from Canada and I'm using veg bloom and my herb is on fire.
[10:46.320 --> 10:48.720]  I'm sorry for the long words, but job bless.
[10:49.080 --> 10:53.640]  Uh, so we did the episode on my nutrient mix episode four Oh five.
[10:53.920 --> 10:57.400]  Our listen for listener friend here, switch their nutrients up to the veg bloom.
[10:57.400 --> 11:00.360]  They did the mix that I said, and now their herbs are on fire.
[11:00.360 --> 11:01.800]  They wanted to send some thanks for that.
[11:02.000 --> 11:02.920]  So I appreciate that.
[11:02.920 --> 11:03.280]  Thank you.
[11:03.280 --> 11:03.920]  Big respect.
[11:04.280 --> 11:07.920]  I don't know where you are now, but I do hope to get to sample
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.400]  some of that fire Rasta herb.
[11:10.600 --> 11:11.080]  Big thanks.
[11:11.080 --> 11:13.520]  I always love getting compliments and getting feedback from the listeners,
[11:13.920 --> 11:16.600]  especially people who, uh, we improve their garden.
[11:16.640 --> 11:17.400]  That's good to know.
[11:18.000 --> 11:18.920]  My favorite part of the show.
[11:19.160 --> 11:19.400]  Yeah.
[11:19.440 --> 11:19.600]  Yeah.
[11:19.600 --> 11:20.360]  We're helping people.
[11:20.640 --> 11:21.560]  I just wanted to share that.
[11:21.920 --> 11:23.360]  A big shout out to our Rasta friend.
[11:23.360 --> 11:24.920]  This one comes from Patreon.
[11:24.920 --> 11:26.240]  I found this one on Patreon.
[11:26.600 --> 11:28.960]  Uh, if you are a Patreon supporter and you've got a question, go ahead
[11:28.960 --> 11:30.360]  and send those to me via Patreon.
[11:30.360 --> 11:33.680]  So I know you are a Patreon contributor and I'll try my best to get to
[11:33.680 --> 11:35.520]  those messages as soon as possible.
[11:35.960 --> 11:38.240]  Don't forget that right now we are recorded ahead.
[11:38.280 --> 11:40.120]  I'm a few episodes ahead of myself.
[11:40.120 --> 11:43.040]  So if you feel like you sent me an email today and I said, I was
[11:43.040 --> 11:44.320]  going to read it on the show.
[11:44.600 --> 11:45.760]  Uh, we're ahead of ourselves.
[11:45.840 --> 11:46.920]  It's probably coming up.
[11:46.920 --> 11:47.800]  I wasn't lying.
[11:48.120 --> 11:50.560]  Uh, but yeah, where we.
[11:50.880 --> 11:53.800]  I knew that things were going weird in the world and I was learning video
[11:53.800 --> 11:55.320]  recording, so we recorded ahead.
[11:55.320 --> 11:58.960]  I've got them in the bank, in the vault is what we call it here in podcasting.
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  So, uh, I'm ahead of myself in case I do get sick.
[12:02.320 --> 12:04.960]  Uh, in case something goes wrong, I need a week off to recover.
[12:05.080 --> 12:05.840]  I've got shows.
[12:05.840 --> 12:07.000]  You guys won't miss content.
[12:07.320 --> 12:09.440]  Uh, planning ahead, trying to be smart for you guys.
[12:09.760 --> 12:11.160]  This one comes from Patreon.
[12:11.320 --> 12:13.120]  Mike, I'm fucking stoned and rambly today.
[12:13.120 --> 12:15.280]  This could be like a seven hour podcast tonight.
[12:16.440 --> 12:16.800]  All right.
[12:16.800 --> 12:18.880]  So, uh, this one comes from Patreon.
[12:18.880 --> 12:20.400]  It comes from our friend Xavier.
[12:20.720 --> 12:22.440]  Uh, it says, Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[12:22.480 --> 12:25.560]  Thanks for being an extremely positive force during these times.
[12:25.560 --> 12:27.680]  We all face much appreciated.
[12:27.680 --> 12:29.760]  Hey, thank you for noticing that I try to stay upbeat.
[12:30.080 --> 12:31.320]  Um, man, thank you.
[12:31.640 --> 12:33.680]  It goes on to say, I have a few questions for you.
[12:33.680 --> 12:37.520]  I recently listened to episode 404 grow lesson part four.
[12:37.760 --> 12:39.880]  I heard you talk about shine a few times.
[12:40.280 --> 12:42.360]  Uh, and I have questions about the shine.
[12:42.360 --> 12:46.080]  I'm wondering what weeks of bloom you recommend using shine.
[12:46.120 --> 12:48.480]  That is a really good question.
[12:48.840 --> 12:50.960]  Shine is a product from a veg bloom.
[12:50.960 --> 12:53.720]  It's a product from they're called hydroponic research is the name of the
[12:53.720 --> 12:54.200]  company.
[12:54.520 --> 12:55.920]  I like the product shine.
[12:55.920 --> 13:00.400]  If you're growing in hydroponics, if you're growing in a cocoa, soilless mix,
[13:00.600 --> 13:05.040]  I think shine is a great product for adding a bulk flavor density.
[13:05.280 --> 13:06.400]  Uh, trichomes.
[13:06.600 --> 13:08.400]  It is a really good bloom booster.
[13:09.200 --> 13:12.880]  Um, it is kind of based on your plants and your budget and the
[13:12.880 --> 13:14.440]  availability of the product.
[13:14.440 --> 13:17.120]  Some people have a harder time getting it based on their location.
[13:17.880 --> 13:20.560]  If it is in the budget, start it early.
[13:20.760 --> 13:23.440]  If it is not in the budget started a little bit later.
[13:23.680 --> 13:27.280]  So if you can afford to use it a week, one or week to a flower, do it.
[13:27.720 --> 13:31.640]  If it is more cost effective for you to wait two weeks, started at week three,
[13:31.640 --> 13:34.960]  but I'm sure you want it in there by week three, by day one of week three,
[13:34.960 --> 13:36.200]  you want to start putting it in there.
[13:36.520 --> 13:38.880]  If not, you definitely need it by week four.
[13:39.240 --> 13:42.200]  And I would use it all the way through the bloom phase, especially the
[13:42.200 --> 13:44.560]  bulking weeks, like five, six, seven, eight.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.240]  Then I stopped using it around flush.
[13:47.680 --> 13:52.440]  Um, in most cases, sometimes I'll use it for, if I'm flushing for 14 days, I'll
[13:52.440 --> 13:57.720]  use the plus the shine for about a week of that, because it's not going to build
[13:57.720 --> 14:00.760]  up in the plant, it's going to, it's going to, you're not going to taste it.
[14:00.760 --> 14:01.840]  It's not going to get stuck in there.
[14:01.840 --> 14:03.360]  We're flushing out most of the other things.
[14:03.360 --> 14:05.120]  We still got seven days to flush that out.
[14:05.520 --> 14:06.680]  I think it'll really bulk up.
[14:07.200 --> 14:10.360]  So, uh, I use it early, uh, week two.
[14:10.640 --> 14:13.200]  If you can, if you can use it a week, one, use it a week, one.
[14:13.200 --> 14:16.120]  If you can't, I'm not saying you can't afford it, but it's an expensive product.
[14:16.120 --> 14:17.320]  You've already bought a lot of things.
[14:17.320 --> 14:18.240]  Maybe you don't have it.
[14:18.520 --> 14:19.480]  Week one's a good idea.
[14:19.480 --> 14:20.280]  Week two is great.
[14:20.280 --> 14:23.120]  Week three, really get it in there by week three, week four.
[14:23.160 --> 14:24.280]  You better have it by now.
[14:24.760 --> 14:28.280]  Uh, if you haven't gotten it by week four, you can still add it at five and six, but
[14:28.280 --> 14:30.200]  it would have been much better if you did it earlier.
[14:30.880 --> 14:32.280]  So that's when I would start adding it.
[14:32.640 --> 14:34.880]  Uh, this person says, uh, you can use it.
[14:34.880 --> 14:36.840]  Can you use it to help stop the initial stretch?
[14:36.840 --> 14:37.120]  Yes.
[14:37.120 --> 14:39.840]  If you do use it early, use it before flower.
[14:39.840 --> 14:42.440]  If you use it a few days before you go into flower, it will
[14:42.440 --> 14:43.520]  help slow down the stretch.
[14:43.520 --> 14:47.000]  That in a combination with popping and twisting the branches that will
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.920]  definitely help slow down the stretch and give you big, fatter plants.
[14:50.520 --> 14:54.040]  Um, it says, I also heard you mentioned some kind of enzyme.
[14:54.320 --> 14:57.520]  Uh, what kind of enzyme would be good to add at the end with my shine?
[14:58.040 --> 14:59.800]  And then it says I'm using advanced nutrients.
[14:59.800 --> 15:02.120]  So what I need to use Synthezyme as my enzyme.
[15:02.120 --> 15:03.360]  That is a really good question.
[15:05.120 --> 15:09.080]  Um, just because you were using the advanced nutrients product line does not
[15:09.080 --> 15:11.120]  mean you need to stick with their enzymes.
[15:11.120 --> 15:15.320]  You can use whatever enzyme product is going to work with your nutrient
[15:15.320 --> 15:20.040]  regimen, anything, uh, Synthezyme, SLF 100, Hygrazine, uh, any of that
[15:20.040 --> 15:21.360]  stuff is going to work for you.
[15:21.840 --> 15:24.640]  The thing you have to pay attention to mostly when you're mixing nutrient
[15:24.640 --> 15:28.840]  companies is if you're using something like a base or a cow mag or something
[15:28.840 --> 15:31.840]  like that, you don't want to use a base nutrient that's got a bunch of nitrogen,
[15:32.040 --> 15:34.520]  but they also put some phosphorus and potassium in there.
[15:34.800 --> 15:37.000]  And then you use a bloom booster from another company.
[15:37.280 --> 15:40.680]  It's got the potassium and phosphorus, but they also put nitrogen in there
[15:40.680 --> 15:42.720]  just because in their recipe, it would have worked.
[15:42.960 --> 15:45.320]  But now you've got two different companies with two different recipes.
[15:45.320 --> 15:46.720]  They had two different game plans.
[15:47.160 --> 15:48.440]  The quarterback threw the ball.
[15:48.720 --> 15:51.800]  They thought that in their game plan that the fucking runner who's the, who
[15:51.800 --> 15:53.440]  catches it, the fucking catcher, what's his name?
[15:53.440 --> 15:54.040]  The wide receiver.
[15:54.240 --> 15:57.600]  They thought that dude was going to go out and left, but he's using a different
[15:57.600 --> 15:58.000]  company.
[15:58.080 --> 15:59.040]  He went out and right.
[15:59.080 --> 16:00.000]  So nobody caught the ball.
[16:00.200 --> 16:02.680]  So now you got fucking a dropped ball and you don't want to drop balls when
[16:02.680 --> 16:03.040]  we're growing.
[16:03.040 --> 16:06.080]  So, uh, just think about if you're using two different companies, that's when you
[16:06.080 --> 16:08.920]  have to pay attention to blending products and product lines.
[16:09.600 --> 16:12.880]  But if you're just, excuse the throat, you guys, I'm talking about those dabs
[16:12.880 --> 16:13.160]  earlier.
[16:13.160 --> 16:13.760]  That's what did it.
[16:14.240 --> 16:17.480]  Uh, if you're using just enzymes, I think any enzyme will work.
[16:17.760 --> 16:19.560]  I really like SLF 100.
[16:19.560 --> 16:20.440]  It's a great product.
[16:20.440 --> 16:21.760]  Hygrozyme is a great product.
[16:22.000 --> 16:23.560]  Synthezyme is an okay product.
[16:23.560 --> 16:26.720]  If you're using the advanced and you want to stick with a brand specific line, go
[16:26.720 --> 16:28.440]  for it, but it is not necessary.
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.200]  Uh, they said what enzyme would be good to add any of those would work for you.
[16:33.200 --> 16:35.280]  It's a very good idea to add those enzymes at the end.
[16:35.280 --> 16:36.280]  It helps clean stuff up.
[16:36.280 --> 16:38.360]  It helps break down anything that may be left in there.
[16:38.840 --> 16:41.840]  Uh, I'll repeat the three again, SLF 100.
[16:42.040 --> 16:43.600]  It's pricey, but it's a good product.
[16:43.880 --> 16:47.160]  Hygrozyme it's pricey, but it's a good product, but you're using advanced
[16:47.160 --> 16:51.480]  nutrients that synthezyme is probably the most expensive enzyme out there.
[16:51.480 --> 16:54.000]  So, uh, those are three that are readily available.
[16:54.160 --> 16:55.400]  Cannazyme is available.
[16:55.440 --> 16:58.000]  There are a lot of great enzymatic products out there.
[16:58.320 --> 16:59.720]  Uh, find the one that fits your budget.
[16:59.960 --> 17:01.000]  Something to think about.
[17:01.360 --> 17:04.440]  Uh, they may look really expensive when you go to buy the bottle, but it may say
[17:04.440 --> 17:06.520]  use one milliliter per gallon.
[17:06.760 --> 17:09.880]  So if you're using one mil per gallon, as opposed to something that takes 10
[17:09.880 --> 17:13.920]  mils per gallon, you have to do the cost effectiveness of the milliliter cost per
[17:13.920 --> 17:15.680]  mil in that container at that time.
[17:15.920 --> 17:18.400]  Don't get sticker shock because one is super expensive.
[17:18.680 --> 17:22.720]  If you only use one mil, that half of whatever it's going to last you a long,
[17:22.720 --> 17:25.840]  long time, if you have to use 10 mils of it, it's going to go much more quickly.
[17:26.080 --> 17:29.400]  So you may be paying more right up front, but it's going to last you a lot longer.
[17:30.800 --> 17:31.400]  All right, Xavier.
[17:31.400 --> 17:32.840]  I think I helped you out with that one.
[17:32.840 --> 17:34.000]  I hope I gave you a good answer.
[17:34.400 --> 17:37.840]  Um, well, let's talk about how much shine to use.
[17:38.160 --> 17:40.040]  Uh, that's probably a good thing to recommend.
[17:40.200 --> 17:41.120]  I start off lightly.
[17:41.120 --> 17:44.440]  If you're going to go, if you're going to go early, just do one gram.
[17:44.440 --> 17:47.480]  If you're going to go before flower or week one or two, a flower
[17:47.480 --> 17:50.520]  start off with one gram per gallon.
[17:51.680 --> 17:52.240]  Thank you, Mike.
[17:52.360 --> 17:53.440]  One gram per gallon.
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.960]  And then yeah, per, uh, per whatever per can of Mountain Dew.
[17:57.440 --> 17:59.480]  Uh, one gram, a gallon per nostril.
[17:59.720 --> 18:00.000]  Yeah.
[18:00.000 --> 18:01.360]  Oh no, don't, don't say that.
[18:01.680 --> 18:02.200]  Okay.
[18:02.520 --> 18:03.960]  People are wondering what kind of show we've got.
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.720]  Don't snort the shine.
[18:05.960 --> 18:06.440]  Who knows?
[18:06.440 --> 18:10.600]  You may get all kinds of trichomes, uh, but one gram of shine per gallon, then
[18:10.600 --> 18:14.800]  at week two, increase it to two and stick with that until week four, then
[18:14.840 --> 18:16.880]  slowly increase it as needed.
[18:16.960 --> 18:19.480]  If you want to, you can stick with two grams.
[18:19.600 --> 18:22.360]  You can get all the way up to more than two.
[18:22.360 --> 18:23.280]  I've done a lot.
[18:23.600 --> 18:25.800]  I don't want to give you numbers because you guys are going to fuck your plants up.
[18:26.120 --> 18:27.560]  Pay attention to the tips of the leaves.
[18:27.560 --> 18:30.720]  When the tips of the leaves get a little, little Brown, a little bit yellow.
[18:30.920 --> 18:32.160]  That's as much as they need.
[18:32.160 --> 18:33.360]  Don't go any more than that.
[18:33.360 --> 18:34.920]  You're pushing them as hard as they need to go.
[18:34.920 --> 18:36.160]  They're starting to get their nails done.
[18:36.160 --> 18:37.080]  They're about to burn.
[18:37.480 --> 18:41.480]  So start off with one, slowly work your way up to two, maybe work your way up to
[18:41.480 --> 18:43.160]  three, pay attention to what the plants do.
[18:43.520 --> 18:46.800]  If you're really happy with what they're doing, maybe try a little bit more.
[18:46.800 --> 18:48.360]  Don't go much past three and a half.
[18:48.360 --> 18:49.400]  You guys don't do that.
[18:49.400 --> 18:50.520]  They'll get fucking sad.
[18:50.520 --> 18:51.120]  They'll get mad.
[18:51.120 --> 18:51.920]  They'll get angry.
[18:52.280 --> 18:55.560]  They'll cook up on you, but increase it slowly and pay attention to what they do.
[18:55.720 --> 18:59.160]  If you're in cocoa, you've really got a lot of opportunity to increase slowly.
[18:59.360 --> 19:00.360]  You're in soilless mix.
[19:00.520 --> 19:02.560]  You got to just water as you can, but pay attention.
[19:02.800 --> 19:05.440]  So start off with one gram, work your way up.
[19:05.800 --> 19:07.240]  Don't go more than three and a half.
[19:07.400 --> 19:10.080]  The guys at veg bloom are going to email me and say three and a half fucking
[19:10.080 --> 19:11.720]  grams, dude, I'm like, yeah, it was fire.
[19:11.800 --> 19:15.680]  We was so good, but everything else has to be in line.
[19:15.680 --> 19:19.200]  Also, you can't be overloading anything else or under loading.
[19:19.200 --> 19:20.480]  Everything else has to be in line.
[19:20.480 --> 19:22.920]  You can't just think I'm going to throw three and a half grams of shine in here.
[19:22.920 --> 19:24.080]  And it's going to be the magic bullet.
[19:24.200 --> 19:26.520]  It's everything else has to be in line for that shine to work.
[19:27.040 --> 19:28.280]  It's like building a body builder.
[19:28.680 --> 19:32.800]  If, uh, if my I've got chicken legs, bro, I'm six foot five.
[19:32.800 --> 19:34.200]  I weigh like 190 pounds.
[19:34.200 --> 19:35.200]  I got fucking chicken legs.
[19:35.200 --> 19:36.440]  I'm not, I'm not ashamed of that.
[19:36.440 --> 19:39.520]  If they don't grow, I could do, I could go do leg day every day, bro.
[19:39.520 --> 19:41.280]  And I'm just going to get more chicken legs.
[19:41.800 --> 19:45.200]  And it'd be like, if you took my chicken legs and put Brock Lesnar's shoulders on
[19:45.200 --> 19:48.120]  there and he told him, go ahead and bend and go ahead and fucking lift all that
[19:48.120 --> 19:49.000]  weight, not a bench press.
[19:49.000 --> 19:49.800]  I know I need my legs.
[19:49.800 --> 19:51.920]  So some kind of standing lift, lift all that weight.
[19:51.920 --> 19:53.000]  My legs are going to crumble.
[19:53.280 --> 19:56.240]  So if you just have a shitty plant and you think you're just going to go feeding
[19:56.360 --> 19:58.360]  a bunch of shine, it's not prepared for that.
[19:58.360 --> 19:59.320]  It's not going to be able to take it.
[19:59.320 --> 20:00.320]  It's got chicken legs, bro.
[20:00.480 --> 20:01.480]  You got to work the whole plant.
[20:01.520 --> 20:05.360]  Everything has to be, uh, in harmony for it all to work beautifully like that.
[20:07.080 --> 20:08.360]  You look like you had something to say, Mike.
[20:09.360 --> 20:09.720]  Nope.
[20:09.840 --> 20:16.040]  Just, uh, try to plan your new feeds out from the start so that you're not
[20:16.640 --> 20:18.360]  rushing to add shit in the middle.
[20:19.040 --> 20:20.640]  Um, that's where people get into trouble.
[20:22.120 --> 20:22.440]  Yeah.
[20:23.200 --> 20:26.280]  I forget that people don't plan ahead very well.
[20:26.680 --> 20:31.480]  If you were on week six, you should know what you're feeding all the way up to
[20:31.480 --> 20:34.640]  the day you flush and you should know the day you flush when I put a crop into
[20:34.640 --> 20:39.920]  flower, I've got a general idea of what day it's coming down, like it may be my
[20:39.920 --> 20:43.200]  first run with the plant, but I know it's either going to take nine or 10 weeks.
[20:43.400 --> 20:44.320]  I've chosen that.
[20:44.320 --> 20:46.880]  I'm going to give it nine or 10 weeks and then I'm going to pay attention
[20:46.880 --> 20:47.880]  to it and I'm going to cut it down.
[20:48.600 --> 20:50.840]  So I know that the week eight, I need to flush.
[20:52.440 --> 20:53.440]  I already know what I'm going to feed it.
[20:53.440 --> 20:54.520]  We want two, three.
[20:54.520 --> 20:56.280]  I already know I've got the recipe figured out.
[20:57.400 --> 21:02.680]  The biggest thing with really good cannabis is, is a plan and sticking to a
[21:02.680 --> 21:03.120]  plan.
[21:04.000 --> 21:07.760]  Um, when people start changing shit in the middle or try a new shit in the
[21:07.760 --> 21:13.600]  middle, or, uh, I w I wanted to start that nutrient this week, but I didn't have it.
[21:13.600 --> 21:18.600]  So I'm gonna start it next week and next week becomes two weeks down the line.
[21:18.600 --> 21:20.560]  And then you're telling people I wanted to start to shine.
[21:20.560 --> 21:22.360]  I would start the shine on week two.
[21:22.960 --> 21:27.040]  I meant to get it out by week two, but I missed week two and then week
[21:27.040 --> 21:28.200]  three kind of got away from me.
[21:28.200 --> 21:30.320]  So I started it kind of end of week four.
[21:30.960 --> 21:31.240]  Yeah.
[21:31.640 --> 21:34.400]  And then you say that shine wasn't the product you expected because
[21:34.400 --> 21:35.440]  you didn't get it in there.
[21:35.480 --> 21:37.960]  You missed two and a half weeks worth of shine opportunity.
[21:38.240 --> 21:40.040]  And it's not just newts either.
[21:40.040 --> 21:45.640]  Like I've talked to people that are, they got to their harvest moment and they
[21:45.640 --> 21:49.600]  went to grab the plant cutters, bolt cutters to chop their plant down and
[21:49.640 --> 21:50.960]  thought, where am I going to hang this girl?
[21:51.240 --> 21:51.560]  Yeah.
[21:52.080 --> 21:52.440]  What?
[21:52.480 --> 21:58.480]  Oh, and now they're scrambling and hanging clothesline and it gets weird
[21:58.480 --> 21:59.560]  just because they didn't plan.
[21:59.760 --> 22:04.560]  And all of a sudden they're, they're a quality cannabis is a C minus because
[22:05.000 --> 22:06.400]  they didn't plan out one step.
[22:06.880 --> 22:10.120]  Because Amazon took an extra week because they didn't deliver something that they
[22:10.120 --> 22:11.760]  should have ordered during week two.
[22:12.000 --> 22:13.600]  Like you guys know you're growing cannabis.
[22:13.600 --> 22:15.520]  You know, you're going to have a harvest in a few weeks.
[22:15.640 --> 22:16.480]  Start thinking ahead.
[22:16.480 --> 22:16.680]  Yeah.
[22:16.880 --> 22:17.560]  Good idea, Mike.
[22:17.560 --> 22:17.800]  So.
[22:18.160 --> 22:19.480]  Uh, have all of your nutrients.
[22:19.480 --> 22:22.880]  If you're in veg and you're going to flower next week, order your flowering
[22:22.880 --> 22:24.840]  nutrients, get them here, go to the store and buy them.
[22:24.840 --> 22:27.400]  If you're waiting on Amazon, if you're waiting on something, go get them.
[22:27.880 --> 22:30.240]  Uh, things are super weird in the world right now.
[22:30.480 --> 22:30.680]  Yep.
[22:30.720 --> 22:32.440]  It's getting a lot harder to do that right now.
[22:32.440 --> 22:35.200]  So the planning becomes even more and more vital.
[22:36.480 --> 22:36.800]  Yeah.
[22:36.800 --> 22:38.560]  And things are going to start running out, you guys.
[22:38.560 --> 22:41.040]  So I've done an episode before on being prepared.
[22:41.160 --> 22:41.960]  So be prepared.
[22:42.280 --> 22:42.480]  Yep.
[22:43.640 --> 22:44.800]  Leave the growth stores alone.
[22:44.960 --> 22:48.000]  I'm trying to avoid all the pandemic and COVID and weird talk, but
[22:48.000 --> 22:49.160]  leave the growth stores alone.
[22:49.960 --> 22:50.200]  All right.
[22:50.480 --> 22:51.560]  Uh, Mike, let's move forward.
[22:51.560 --> 22:52.320]  I'm high and rambly.
[22:52.320 --> 22:54.920]  And so were you, so we could really get far off the rails tonight.
[22:55.440 --> 22:58.880]  Uh, we've got another, yeah, those are our friends.
[22:58.880 --> 23:01.440]  You guys, uh, this, uh, what is it called?
[23:01.440 --> 23:02.400]  This is an email, right?
[23:02.400 --> 23:02.560]  Yeah.
[23:02.560 --> 23:06.520]  This email comes from somebody who calls themselves Edward and it goes, Hey,
[23:06.520 --> 23:08.160]  Rasta, Jeff, what's up, Edward.
[23:08.160 --> 23:08.920]  Thank you for the support.
[23:09.160 --> 23:12.920]  It goes, I just heard episode five 35 and I cannot wait anymore.
[23:13.160 --> 23:15.840]  You have to be one of the best shows in podcast land.
[23:15.880 --> 23:16.320]  Thank you.
[23:16.680 --> 23:19.840]  I just noticed that every email I read starts off with the people
[23:20.040 --> 23:21.400]  thanking me and saying I'm the best.
[23:21.440 --> 23:25.960]  I don't pick the emails that say that they all say that it's not a selection thing.
[23:25.960 --> 23:26.920]  That's just how they start.
[23:26.960 --> 23:27.520]  Thank you guys.
[23:27.520 --> 23:30.000]  I love that, but it looks like I'm picking them based on that.
[23:30.240 --> 23:32.560]  I'm not trust me or please trust me.
[23:32.880 --> 23:36.360]  It goes on to say, if anything, I can't talk, can't stop talking
[23:36.360 --> 23:37.720]  about your current flower.
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.320]  Uh, you were making the listeners in prohibition land sad.
[23:41.320 --> 23:42.840]  Oh, they said, don't stop talking.
[23:43.320 --> 23:44.960]  No, they said, do stop talking about it.
[23:44.960 --> 23:47.240]  If anything, stop talking about your current flower.
[23:47.560 --> 23:50.000]  Uh, they're upset and sad that we're over here smoking the guava
[23:50.000 --> 23:51.680]  papayas and telling them about it.
[23:53.160 --> 23:56.480]  I like to check in on places like Reddit and check out what people
[23:56.480 --> 23:57.960]  are smoking around the country.
[23:57.960 --> 24:00.640]  And every now and then I see something that's just like, Oh my God.
[24:00.640 --> 24:02.280]  I haven't seen that since high school.
[24:02.960 --> 24:03.320]  Yeah.
[24:03.640 --> 24:07.920]  Uh, Scotty real has a little bit of brick weed on his shelf behind him in the show.
[24:08.240 --> 24:11.360]  And it's funny just to see the brick weed sometimes like, Hey bro, I want to smoke a
[24:11.360 --> 24:12.520]  joint and he's playing with it.
[24:12.520 --> 24:14.160]  And you're like, Oh no, dude.
[24:14.360 --> 24:14.920]  No.
[24:15.360 --> 24:18.960]  Uh, but our friend Edward says, seriously, I love the show and I did my best
[24:18.960 --> 24:20.720]  with my monthly contributions.
[24:20.720 --> 24:21.240]  Hey, thank you.
[24:21.240 --> 24:22.080]  I appreciate that.
[24:22.360 --> 24:26.000]  Uh, I will have to associate the name and the email with the Patreon so I can see
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.880]  what you're contributing and send you a special thank you.
[24:28.320 --> 24:29.920]  It goes on to say my questions.
[24:30.200 --> 24:31.320]  I have some new seedlings.
[24:31.360 --> 24:33.160]  They have reached about five inches.
[24:33.560 --> 24:36.960]  Only the top four leaves have appeared and they are falling over.
[24:37.320 --> 24:39.320]  Uh, so we've got, that's about four inches.
[24:39.320 --> 24:40.400]  I'm picturing GI Joe.
[24:40.400 --> 24:42.480]  GI Joe is like three and a half, three and three quarters.
[24:42.880 --> 24:46.840]  So they're about five inches and only the top four leaves have
[24:46.840 --> 24:48.920]  appeared and then they fall over.
[24:49.120 --> 24:52.440]  And then it says, why I put some toothpicks next to them, but they are not
[24:52.440 --> 24:53.840]  strong enough to support the weight.
[24:54.240 --> 24:56.000]  What should I do?
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.480]  So this is what we call getting leggy.
[24:59.480 --> 24:59.720]  Yeah.
[24:59.720 --> 25:00.920]  They're stretchy and leggy.
[25:01.040 --> 25:02.920]  Uh, you, you don't want to put some popsicle sticks.
[25:02.920 --> 25:04.520]  You don't want to put pens in there to keep them up.
[25:04.920 --> 25:07.400]  Um, or you can, that may be what you have to do at this point,
[25:07.400 --> 25:08.600]  but that's not the idea.
[25:09.280 --> 25:10.440]  Um, what should I do?
[25:10.800 --> 25:13.240]  Those plants want a little bit light.
[25:13.280 --> 25:14.960]  They want a little, I was going to say one, a little bit more
[25:14.960 --> 25:16.360]  of everything except water.
[25:16.400 --> 25:17.440]  They want more light.
[25:17.480 --> 25:18.640]  They want more air.
[25:18.960 --> 25:21.960]  Uh, yeah, they need a little bit of wind on them, but I think
[25:21.960 --> 25:23.040]  they're reaching for the light.
[25:23.280 --> 25:26.760]  You've probably got them under a low quality light, a low power light.
[25:27.040 --> 25:29.000]  Certainly not the correct spectrum light.
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.520]  So they're going, Hey, the main thing I want out of life right now is light.
[25:32.560 --> 25:33.360]  I'm looking for it.
[25:33.400 --> 25:34.520]  I think it might be up there.
[25:34.520 --> 25:36.360]  I'm going to try to keep growing until I get to it.
[25:36.680 --> 25:39.400]  And it's not going to get to it because the light is not the right light.
[25:39.400 --> 25:40.400]  So you need more light.
[25:40.800 --> 25:44.000]  Then you need a little bit of wind, a little bit of wind will prevent
[25:44.000 --> 25:45.360]  them from getting so stretchy.
[25:45.640 --> 25:45.840]  Yeah.
[25:45.840 --> 25:46.360]  Just a time.
[25:46.360 --> 25:48.640]  Don't go fucking breaking them and destroying them, but a little
[25:48.640 --> 25:50.000]  wind makes them kind of struggle.
[25:50.320 --> 25:53.240]  And they, they kind of think about Mike, what's the first thing you do?
[25:53.240 --> 25:55.720]  If I were just to shove you punch me back, right?
[25:57.160 --> 25:58.000]  Back a little bit.
[25:58.000 --> 25:59.880]  Just you spread your feet to get your balance.
[26:00.040 --> 26:01.520]  When you get pushed, you spread your feet.
[26:01.560 --> 26:04.840]  So if I, when you blow in the plant, it's going to get rattled, it's
[26:04.840 --> 26:07.360]  going to spread its roots to try to hold itself up and get stronger.
[26:07.680 --> 26:10.520]  So then it might punch you back the stock a little bit.
[26:10.880 --> 26:11.120]  Yeah.
[26:11.200 --> 26:14.680]  Strengthen up that so that it can hold the setup a little harder and reach for
[26:14.680 --> 26:16.160]  the stars where it wants to be with.
[26:16.520 --> 26:18.560]  Then I'm going to assume it's been overwatered.
[26:19.320 --> 26:20.960]  Also, you're probably overwatering.
[26:20.960 --> 26:22.840]  If it's not getting enough light, it's not growing.
[26:22.840 --> 26:23.800]  It's not doing anything.
[26:23.800 --> 26:27.520]  It's not, it's probably a little bit overwatered and that is probably because
[26:27.520 --> 26:29.200]  it is not in the appropriate soil.
[26:29.200 --> 26:31.160]  You need some aerated soil for a ceiling.
[26:31.400 --> 26:33.880]  So think about lights, air, water, and soil, and make sure
[26:33.880 --> 26:35.320]  that all of those are correct.
[26:35.800 --> 26:38.440]  But it sounds like light is probably the main culprit here.
[26:38.440 --> 26:39.480]  Put some more light on it.
[26:40.120 --> 26:41.560]  That should keep it a little bit tighter.
[26:41.840 --> 26:44.600]  I've noticed if you listen to the previous episode, when I switched to the
[26:44.600 --> 26:46.800]  LEDs, my growth went crazy.
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.800]  So that is a huge testament to different light.
[26:48.800 --> 26:52.640]  I went from T5s to LEDs and saw double the growth really quickly.
[26:52.640 --> 26:54.600]  So the light is probably the culprit.
[26:55.040 --> 26:59.000]  Then it goes on to say, have you helped anyone with an aquaponic system?
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.560]  There are many YouTube videos and write-ups out there, but no
[27:01.560 --> 27:03.280]  one gives a real concise answer.
[27:03.560 --> 27:04.600]  Let me know your thoughts.
[27:04.680 --> 27:08.800]  I have built one with love and I would love to share my progress with you.
[27:09.560 --> 27:15.360]  So yeah, I do not grow aquaponically, but I do know the guy named Aquaponic Steve,
[27:15.360 --> 27:18.840]  and he's got a podcast called Growing With Fishes and they specialize
[27:18.840 --> 27:21.200]  in growing with fishes.
[27:21.400 --> 27:26.920]  So I think Potent Ponics may be, I think Potent Ponics Steve is the way to find
[27:26.920 --> 27:31.480]  him on social media and the podcast is called Growing With Fishes.
[27:31.840 --> 27:33.480]  So that's what you should look for.
[27:33.800 --> 27:36.240]  Also check out the Dude Grows show.
[27:36.440 --> 27:40.240]  It may not be about aquaponics, but if you like my show and you're growing
[27:40.240 --> 27:45.200]  aquaponics, Steve Dredd from the Growing With Fishes show is also a good friend
[27:45.200 --> 27:47.960]  with the Embracing Organics crew and the Dude Grows crew.
[27:48.160 --> 27:49.880]  So make sure you check out the Dude Grows crew.
[27:49.880 --> 27:52.160]  I think you'll enjoy that show or the Dude Grows show.
[27:52.520 --> 27:53.240]  It's on YouTube.
[27:53.240 --> 27:54.800]  It's on wherever you're listening to podcasts.
[27:54.800 --> 27:56.080]  The Dude Grows show is on there.
[27:56.080 --> 27:58.400]  If you're hearing my show, you can find that show there.
[27:58.880 --> 28:01.320]  And Embracing Organics also, that is on YouTube.
[28:01.320 --> 28:02.840]  They talk about organically growing.
[28:02.840 --> 28:05.520]  We talk about cultivation and all kinds of aspects.
[28:05.720 --> 28:09.160]  So if you want to learn more about growing, growing with fishes, it may be
[28:09.160 --> 28:12.640]  called Potent Ponics, growing with fishes will get you to the show.
[28:13.120 --> 28:17.400]  The Dude Grows show and Embracing Organics are both great avenues to expand
[28:17.440 --> 28:22.520]  your aquaponic and cultivation, organic cultivation knowledge.
[28:23.120 --> 28:25.360]  Boy, Mike, we should dab something different on the next episode.
[28:25.360 --> 28:29.160]  Cause that fucking papaya guava shit got me stuttery and weird today.
[28:29.720 --> 28:30.600]  Exactly.
[28:31.120 --> 28:31.640]  Yeah.
[28:32.560 --> 28:34.240]  Going with the last email.
[28:34.960 --> 28:38.960]  A lot of people when they're first starting to get into growing, they, they
[28:38.960 --> 28:44.360]  say, I want to start growing herb and I want to grow, and then there's a very
[28:44.360 --> 28:51.680]  difficult way to grow that comes after that, either with fish or in a column or
[28:51.680 --> 28:54.960]  with, I'm going to steal a train car and bury it eight feet underground.
[28:54.960 --> 28:55.800]  Water sprayers.
[28:56.400 --> 28:57.320]  Oh, aeroponically?
[28:57.360 --> 28:58.280]  Aeroponically.
[28:58.280 --> 28:58.600]  Yeah.
[28:59.320 --> 29:01.160]  Grow underground in train cars.
[29:01.160 --> 29:04.680]  And I mean, honestly, if it's your first couple of grows, just focus on
[29:04.680 --> 29:07.280]  getting good growing in your space.
[29:07.600 --> 29:07.840]  Yeah.
[29:07.920 --> 29:12.360]  Understand managing the environmental controls of your space because that's
[29:12.360 --> 29:18.160]  like half the battle, like not to steal from the Joes or anything, but it really
[29:18.160 --> 29:21.640]  is half the battle, getting your space dialed in and learning how to, to
[29:21.640 --> 29:24.360]  manipulate it successfully for what you're trying to do.
[29:24.640 --> 29:24.960]  Yeah.
[29:25.240 --> 29:29.560]  Learn the gear and learn basically the plants, learn the, what light cycles do.
[29:29.600 --> 29:33.280]  Like what happens when I trim a plant here, learn the basics of plant growth,
[29:33.400 --> 29:37.240]  the cycles, the nutritive cycles, and then learn how to make all that happen with
[29:37.240 --> 29:37.640]  fish.
[29:38.000 --> 29:41.360]  But if that's really the way you want to jump in, I'm no one to, uh, to sway you
[29:41.360 --> 29:45.200]  from living the fucking dream, but it is really a challenging way to jump in.
[29:45.720 --> 29:51.880]  I've seen some really beautiful in theory setups that they use fish, but they all
[29:51.920 --> 29:56.320]  scared the shit out of me because fish plus an environment that's good for fish
[29:56.800 --> 30:00.440]  plus water pumps and hoses in my brain equals a nightmare.
[30:01.400 --> 30:03.200]  Um, lots of clogged hoses.
[30:03.200 --> 30:06.960]  I just keep picturing Brian cleaning out the little sprayer nozzles.
[30:07.280 --> 30:07.720]  Oh yeah.
[30:08.560 --> 30:12.840]  The facility, you know, I'm talking about and just mag, instead of that stuff, it's
[30:12.840 --> 30:13.360]  fish shit.
[30:14.080 --> 30:15.320]  That's just what I picture.
[30:15.640 --> 30:15.920]  Yeah.
[30:16.560 --> 30:16.720]  Yeah.
[30:16.720 --> 30:17.600]  It's a clogged sprayer.
[30:17.600 --> 30:20.720]  We went from being cultivators to working at fucking SeaWorld.
[30:21.200 --> 30:21.440]  Nope.
[30:21.720 --> 30:22.000]  Yeah.
[30:22.720 --> 30:23.160]  I'm sorry.
[30:23.200 --> 30:24.080]  No fuck SeaWorld.
[30:24.120 --> 30:29.000]  But anyway, the more that it's, um, God, I'm so fucking high.
[30:29.000 --> 30:30.080]  What am I trying to say right now?
[30:30.640 --> 30:35.520]  You tell me, dude, I, um, environmentally sustainable growing is killer.
[30:35.560 --> 30:39.600]  And so if you can keep a thriving, grow going based on a fish pond, like by all
[30:39.600 --> 30:40.320]  means, do it.
[30:40.800 --> 30:41.560]  It's gotta be fun.
[30:41.600 --> 30:41.800]  Yeah.
[30:41.800 --> 30:44.600]  Cause you get to take care of fishies and you probably get to name the tilapia that
[30:44.600 --> 30:46.920]  are swimming around or whatever, but that's, I don't know.
[30:46.920 --> 30:48.080]  That's a whole new ball game.
[30:48.120 --> 30:50.920]  Fish food is way fucking cheaper than bottled nudes.
[30:50.960 --> 30:52.160]  I know that for a fact.
[30:52.600 --> 30:53.760]  Well, maybe what do you feel?
[30:53.800 --> 30:55.320]  Because you got to think about that.
[30:55.320 --> 30:57.200]  Fish food is going to turn into fish poop.
[30:58.160 --> 31:00.320]  Is going to turn into the nutrients for my plants.
[31:00.320 --> 31:02.920]  So I may totally change up my fish food diet at that point.
[31:02.920 --> 31:06.640]  They may get caviar and steaks and whatever they want at that point.
[31:07.200 --> 31:08.400]  I highly doubt it.
[31:09.160 --> 31:12.240]  Uh, this episode or this fuck, I keep calling this email an episode.
[31:12.240 --> 31:12.520]  Jeez.
[31:12.520 --> 31:13.920]  How high are we going to get today?
[31:13.920 --> 31:16.040]  So it was brought to you by too much hash.
[31:16.080 --> 31:16.440]  Yes.
[31:16.480 --> 31:19.560]  Uh, this episode of two guys coughing is brought to you by a, yeah.
[31:19.600 --> 31:20.480]  Seeds here now.com.
[31:20.800 --> 31:22.880]  Uh, this up, the email says to try to do it again.
[31:23.040 --> 31:26.160]  Again, I'm a new grower and I want to use aquaponics to support my grow.
[31:26.520 --> 31:28.160]  Be good to talk soon.
[31:28.280 --> 31:30.800]  Uh, from your friend, Edward, a shout out to Edward.
[31:31.040 --> 31:33.920]  I hope we did not discourage you from aquaponic growing.
[31:34.160 --> 31:36.880]  It's going to be a lot of extra work, but if that's your passion,
[31:37.080 --> 31:38.320]  follow your dream, dude, do that.
[31:39.360 --> 31:42.160]  Just an extra learning step, man, by all means, dive in.
[31:42.320 --> 31:43.640]  I said, just get the book first.
[31:44.000 --> 31:44.240]  Yeah.
[31:44.320 --> 31:48.240]  And definitely, uh, talk to aquaponic, Steve, Steve Rassner, Steve dread.
[31:48.240 --> 31:49.160]  He's got a lot of names.
[31:49.440 --> 31:50.440]  Uh, he's awesome.
[31:50.440 --> 31:50.640]  Dude.
[31:50.640 --> 31:53.240]  He's got dreadlocks down to his ass, a big old fuzzy beard.
[31:53.480 --> 31:54.880]  Uh, he's been on the dude grow show.
[31:54.880 --> 31:56.480]  He hangs out at all the dude grows parties.
[31:56.640 --> 31:57.480]  He's a friend of mine.
[31:57.680 --> 31:58.640]  Trust him, respect him.
[31:58.640 --> 32:00.600]  I think he will steer you in the right direction.
[32:00.640 --> 32:02.600]  And I think you'd enjoy his podcast also.
[32:02.880 --> 32:03.440]  Shout out, Steve.
[32:03.440 --> 32:04.280]  I hope you're listening, brother.
[32:04.640 --> 32:05.400]  Hope you're well also.
[32:06.040 --> 32:09.080]  Um, if anybody else out there has a question, we'd love to hear from you.
[32:09.080 --> 32:11.920]  The email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[32:11.920 --> 32:12.520]  Don't be shy.
[32:12.760 --> 32:14.120]  Send me an email, Mike.
[32:14.120 --> 32:16.000]  I've got one more email here in front of me.
[32:16.080 --> 32:19.000]  We're going to do four in this episode, just because one was super
[32:19.240 --> 32:19.640]  quick.
[32:20.160 --> 32:21.920]  Uh, this one says, Hey Ross to Jeff.
[32:21.920 --> 32:23.240]  I hope things are going well for you.
[32:23.240 --> 32:26.640]  My name is, I don't know if they want their name set in there, dude.
[32:26.720 --> 32:27.400]  So we're going to skip it.
[32:27.640 --> 32:30.920]  And we met briefly at the endo expo this year and I grabbed some
[32:30.920 --> 32:33.080]  double dragon seeds from you.
[32:33.320 --> 32:34.520]  Uh, thank you for the support.
[32:34.800 --> 32:38.200]  I think I remember meeting you and I'm glad that you got some double dragon seeds.
[32:38.200 --> 32:43.080]  I look forward to seeing you at the next endo expo, whenever that may be in these
[32:43.080 --> 32:44.680]  weird times in which we live now.
[32:45.440 --> 32:47.800]  Uh, I need a weedy zoom expo.
[32:48.240 --> 32:49.440]  The zoom expo.
[32:49.920 --> 32:50.760]  Stop it, Mike.
[32:52.000 --> 32:55.360]  It goes on to say, I recently saw an Instagram post of yours, uh, where
[32:55.360 --> 32:57.440]  you posted your reverse spray.
[32:57.440 --> 32:57.720]  Yes.
[32:57.720 --> 33:02.080]  I posted a big, a liter of silver thiosulfate that I had freshly mixed up.
[33:02.480 --> 33:05.960]  It says I've been working with SDS spray for some months now, and I've always
[33:05.960 --> 33:09.440]  been under the impression that it should come out clear after it is mixed.
[33:09.440 --> 33:12.520]  And your Instagram post, it appears slightly colored.
[33:12.560 --> 33:14.720]  Do you use, or do you use a surfactant?
[33:15.280 --> 33:19.000]  Um, or do you think this is what happens when we use expired product?
[33:19.000 --> 33:21.920]  Because that has happened to me before, or is the color of your
[33:21.920 --> 33:23.560]  spray normal as it comes out?
[33:23.560 --> 33:27.560]  Thanks for taking your time to read this and smoke a fat dab for me, dude.
[33:27.560 --> 33:30.280]  I've got a fat dab on the dabber so that as soon as this show ends,
[33:30.280 --> 33:31.280]  I'll hit this dab for you.
[33:31.280 --> 33:32.840]  This one is going to be dedicated to you.
[33:33.320 --> 33:35.120]  I do know the picture for you.
[33:35.280 --> 33:35.640]  Yeah.
[33:35.640 --> 33:35.800]  Yeah.
[33:35.800 --> 33:36.760]  We're going to do it properly.
[33:37.040 --> 33:39.720]  I do know the Instagram post you're speaking of.
[33:39.920 --> 33:42.160]  I made that jar of silver thiosulfate.
[33:42.160 --> 33:42.760]  I shook it up.
[33:42.760 --> 33:43.480]  I diluted it.
[33:43.480 --> 33:44.640]  I applied it to some plants.
[33:44.640 --> 33:45.480]  I remember that day.
[33:45.480 --> 33:46.440]  I remember that batch.
[33:46.440 --> 33:47.520]  I remember that photo.
[33:48.040 --> 33:53.160]  Uh, the silo silver thiosulfate solution in that jar is quite clear.
[33:53.400 --> 33:55.440]  What's not clear is the wall behind me.
[33:55.760 --> 33:57.600]  I took that photo in front of this wall right here.
[33:57.600 --> 34:00.560]  It is sort of an off white color that came through in the photo.
[34:00.560 --> 34:05.240]  So it looks like the photo, the solution of dabbed out eggshell paint behind it.
[34:05.440 --> 34:05.680]  Yeah.
[34:05.680 --> 34:06.000]  Yeah.
[34:06.040 --> 34:06.320]  Yeah.
[34:06.480 --> 34:07.240]  It's off white, bro.
[34:07.240 --> 34:07.920]  It's from Supreme.
[34:07.960 --> 34:08.560]  It's off white.
[34:08.760 --> 34:09.360]  No, I'm just fucking on.
[34:09.640 --> 34:12.440]  Uh, but it's not pure white.
[34:12.440 --> 34:13.560]  It's kind of, yeah, it is eggshell.
[34:13.720 --> 34:14.360]  It's probably back there.
[34:14.360 --> 34:15.760]  It's been too much dab smoke.
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.520]  So it made the solution, look like it did have some color to it, but no, it is
[34:19.520 --> 34:22.080]  completely clear, uh, it should be clear.
[34:22.240 --> 34:24.120]  Sometimes you may see little flakes in it.
[34:24.120 --> 34:25.640]  That means that your stuff didn't dissolve.
[34:25.640 --> 34:27.040]  You should have dissolved it, shook it up more.
[34:27.040 --> 34:27.960]  You can probably shake it more.
[34:27.960 --> 34:28.840]  It'll break up in there.
[34:29.440 --> 34:33.000]  Uh, but it should be clear if it turns dark colors when you're mixing it.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.360]  That means that your solution has probably been exposed to too much light or that
[34:36.360 --> 34:40.360]  there's moisture or something went wrong in either the silver or the sodium
[34:40.360 --> 34:42.320]  powders is what that probably means.
[34:42.320 --> 34:46.640]  One of the companies has stopped sending me fine, fine powder and they sent me bigger chunks.
[34:46.640 --> 34:52.720]  Those chunks don't dissolve very well and sometimes I do see colored particles floating around.
[34:52.720 --> 34:57.760]  So what I've begun to do is I put those chunks in a baggie and I wrap that baggie in newspaper
[34:57.760 --> 35:02.160]  and I crush it with a hammer to make those chunks smaller and I don't get that problem anymore.
[35:02.160 --> 35:03.840]  The solution works better.
[35:03.840 --> 35:07.120]  So that's a little tip for you if you're buying from the same company as myself
[35:07.120 --> 35:10.320]  and they've started sending you the pellets instead of the powder, crush the pellets.
[35:10.320 --> 35:11.200]  It's the same shit.
[35:11.760 --> 35:13.680]  You just have to crush down their big crystals.
[35:14.480 --> 35:19.280]  They think they're doing you favors by sending you the big buds and we just want the shake.
[35:19.280 --> 35:21.040]  So no, I do not use a surfactant.
[35:21.040 --> 35:23.920]  I soak the shit out of the plant to the point of runoff.
[35:23.920 --> 35:25.440]  I don't only spray the leaves.
[35:25.440 --> 35:28.320]  I make it a point to spray the branch of the plant.
[35:28.320 --> 35:32.240]  The main meristem, the main branch of the plant also gets sprayed with silver.
[35:33.920 --> 35:36.880]  I think that is everything that we need to cover on that one.
[35:37.680 --> 35:38.720]  The spray was clear.
[35:38.720 --> 35:40.400]  I don't use a surfactant.
[35:40.640 --> 35:43.280]  If you've got colors, probably contaminants.
[35:44.720 --> 35:45.840]  Say that again, Mike.
[35:45.840 --> 35:46.960]  Nice, easy question.
[35:46.960 --> 35:47.920]  Nice, easy question.
[35:47.920 --> 35:48.480]  Yeah.
[35:48.480 --> 35:50.640]  And I'm glad you asked because that means you're paying attention.
[35:51.200 --> 35:52.400]  This stuff was clear, bro.
[35:52.400 --> 35:55.280]  It was just the wall behind me.
[35:55.280 --> 35:59.200]  When you read the question, I smiled because I was hoping personally that it was like an
[35:59.200 --> 36:02.560]  Instagram filter and you're like, no, that's just opaque, bro.
[36:02.560 --> 36:05.760]  Now just the wall behind me needs a little bit of repaint.
[36:05.760 --> 36:07.120]  Even better answer.
[36:07.120 --> 36:08.560]  Yeah, it was either the lighting or the wall.
[36:08.560 --> 36:10.480]  Something gave it some color, but it is clear.
[36:10.480 --> 36:11.520]  It is completely clear.
[36:12.160 --> 36:16.400]  You'll be happy to know that all of that thiosulfate has been applied to a plant.
[36:16.400 --> 36:21.920]  And now that female looks totally like a male and it is about to produce pollen here in
[36:21.920 --> 36:23.440]  the next five to seven days.
[36:23.440 --> 36:26.960]  It should have a nice big tray of pollen to play with.
[36:26.960 --> 36:27.920]  That'll be a good time.
[36:29.680 --> 36:34.400]  All right, Mike, I think we've been going for a little over 30 minutes, maybe unless
[36:34.400 --> 36:35.600]  we make an edit or two here.
[36:35.600 --> 36:38.400]  So I think we've got enough content to call it a quality podcast.
[36:38.960 --> 36:40.560]  Happy podcast, everybody.
[36:40.560 --> 36:42.800]  It's kind of weird now that I'm not fucking baked out of my brain.
[36:42.800 --> 36:45.360]  The show is over and I feel like I could do a podcast now.
[36:45.360 --> 36:47.120]  Just downshift into reality.
[36:47.920 --> 36:50.320]  I think I landed in the middle of that show somewhere.
[36:50.320 --> 36:51.120]  Let's fix that.
[36:51.840 --> 36:53.520]  Yeah, we're definitely going to fix that.
[36:53.520 --> 36:56.640]  As soon as I do the catchphrase, we will take some dabs together.
[36:56.640 --> 36:57.680]  One little binger.
[36:57.680 --> 36:59.200]  It'll brighten up your day.
[36:59.200 --> 37:00.000]  Just one, man.
[37:00.000 --> 37:00.880]  Then I got to go.
[37:01.840 --> 37:04.400]  If you know a movie that's from, high five and fucking shout out.
[37:04.400 --> 37:05.280]  You're cooler than shit.
[37:06.480 --> 37:07.520]  That weasel stole the bee.
[37:09.440 --> 37:12.160]  Um, I fucking know Tom.
[37:13.200 --> 37:16.640]  Mike, do you have anything to add at the end of this show before we start doing all the
[37:16.640 --> 37:17.840]  business parts again?
[37:17.840 --> 37:20.800]  I just want to say that Jeff knows how to carve and everything.
[37:20.800 --> 37:21.760]  Everything, man.
[37:21.760 --> 37:22.720]  I did not exhale.
[37:23.840 --> 37:27.040]  If you feel like this episode is educational, informative, and or entertaining, and you'd

[38:33.040 --> 38:33.760]  Oh yeah, man.
[38:33.760 --> 38:34.560]  Thanks for having me.
[38:35.200 --> 38:36.960]  I think the audience loves having you here.
[38:36.960 --> 38:40.320]  I get a lot of great messages, a lot of good feedback when you're on the show.
[38:40.320 --> 38:42.560]  Looks like Mike is going to dab some jam band.
[38:42.560 --> 38:44.960]  I'm going to hit more of this guava papaya.
[38:44.960 --> 38:48.560]  It's obviously doing something to my brain, so why not just keep this weirdness fucking
[38:48.560 --> 38:49.360]  going?
[38:49.360 --> 38:53.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers and growers,
[38:53.680 --> 38:55.920]  dad, kids and flower children.
[38:55.920 --> 38:57.920]  I want to thank everybody for listening to the show.
[38:57.920 --> 39:00.880]  Thanks for tolerating my fucking rambles in this episode.
[39:00.880 --> 39:02.240]  I know I was a mess.
[39:02.240 --> 39:03.360]  Mike knows I was a mess.
[39:03.360 --> 39:03.920]  We had fun.
[39:03.920 --> 39:04.640]  That's what matters.
[39:04.640 --> 39:06.960]  I hope I helped you out in some sort of a way.
[39:06.960 --> 39:07.760]  Mike tapped his head.
[39:07.760 --> 39:09.360]  I don't know what that even means.
[39:09.360 --> 39:10.800]  I know you were a mess, bro.
[39:10.800 --> 39:12.320]  We were a mess together.
[39:12.320 --> 39:13.280]  We were a fun mess.
[39:13.280 --> 39:14.800]  We were a hot mess.
[39:14.800 --> 39:16.400]  Some episodes are going to be that way.
[39:16.400 --> 39:18.240]  Some of them are going to be fucking gems.
[39:18.240 --> 39:20.080]  This means we are going to be a gem.
[39:20.080 --> 39:21.440]  They like it when we ramble.
[39:21.440 --> 39:22.560]  They do like it when we ramble.
[39:22.560 --> 39:25.120]  The best part about podcasting is nobody got hurt.
[39:25.120 --> 39:26.000]  Nothing bad happened.
[39:26.480 --> 39:29.120]  As many times as I fell in my face, I got back up and kept running.
[39:30.400 --> 39:31.600]  Damn, Skippy, bro.
[39:31.600 --> 39:32.480]  Damn, no skipping.
[39:32.480 --> 39:33.840]  I may fall down if I skip, dude.
[39:33.840 --> 39:34.320]  I'm so high.
[39:34.320 --> 39:35.440]  I don't know about that.
[39:35.440 --> 39:37.360]  All right, you guys, we're going to end the rambles here.
[39:37.360 --> 39:38.400]  We're going to take some dabs.
[39:39.200 --> 39:41.520]  I want to give a giant shout out to my friend, Michael Harper.
[39:41.520 --> 39:45.120]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
