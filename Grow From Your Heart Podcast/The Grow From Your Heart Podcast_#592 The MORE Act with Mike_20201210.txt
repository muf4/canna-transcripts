[00:00.000 --> 00:14.320]  Welcome back podcast world. I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff, and it is time
[00:14.320 --> 00:19.800]  for episode 592 of the grow from your heart podcast. If you're watching on YouTube, I'm
[00:19.800 --> 00:24.160]  sure you can see by now that white Mike is joining me. Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:24.160 --> 00:26.600]  What's up, man? What's up, everybody?
[00:26.600 --> 00:30.280]  Mike is going to do a little bit of a, uh, there's a recent political thing that everybody's
[00:30.280 --> 00:33.840]  talking about. Mike is going to clear up some myths and misconceptions and kind of tell
[00:33.840 --> 00:37.720]  us what is going on with this cannabis news bill that is happening that everyone's talking
[00:37.720 --> 00:41.520]  about. Uh, but you know, we do like to start this show by talking about what we're smoking.
[00:41.520 --> 00:45.840]  So I'm going to be a polite host and ask Mike, what are you smoking on tonight, brother?
[00:45.840 --> 00:50.800]  Um, bunch of local flower, man. I've been hitting different shops lately. And, uh, I
[00:50.800 --> 00:54.240]  think a lot of people heard me bitching about people not triven because things have been
[00:54.240 --> 00:58.240]  looking a lot better than they were a few months ago. I bought some dispensary herb
[00:58.240 --> 01:02.880]  and it is completely super trimmed. I haven't seen herb trim like this in a long time. It
[01:02.880 --> 01:06.800]  is very well trimmed. So they may have been listening to you. Yeah. The last couple of
[01:06.800 --> 01:11.840]  runs I've made, everything looked a lot better. So good. Check out your local shops, pick
[01:11.840 --> 01:16.600]  up some flower. There you go. Uh, have you noticed that shops, uh, their menus are changing
[01:16.600 --> 01:20.920]  rapidly? I feel like there's a lot more cannabis consumption every day. Yeah. People are buying
[01:20.920 --> 01:24.080]  the shops out. They're cleaning it out really quickly. They're having to restock really
[01:24.080 --> 01:28.880]  quickly. I haven't seen traffic at the dispensaries like this in a long time. So this is pretty
[01:28.880 --> 01:33.200]  interesting. It's like four 20 every day at the dispensary. Now the sales reports reflect
[01:33.200 --> 01:38.040]  that too, that they get reported in the press. Yeah. It's been ridiculous for cannabis. Uh,
[01:38.040 --> 01:41.120]  we kind of predicted that at the start of the, uh, the whole thing here. I said, this
[01:41.120 --> 01:44.440]  cannabis is going to go crazy. Even when they were doing curbside service, they were still
[01:44.440 --> 01:50.600]  crushing it. Yeah. I, uh, I went to the shop today and drove right past because their parking
[01:51.280 --> 01:56.920]  lot was absolutely full and they had a line out the door, 15 deep out the door. So I didn't
[01:56.920 --> 02:01.160]  feel like waiting that I kept driving. Yeah. They must be having a sale or something in
[02:01.160 --> 02:06.960]  there. Wow. Just a Saturday, bro. Oh yeah. It's weird when one shop right down the street
[02:06.960 --> 02:10.960]  has all the people and there are two or three shops on the way with no people. You're like,
[02:10.960 --> 02:14.840]  well, that's the shop that works. They should probably just kind of consolidate all those
[02:14.840 --> 02:20.080]  other shops or something. It's the market will get there eventually. It does that. Yes,
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.480]  it does. We saw, we watched that happen in Denver when the, uh, Broadster dam, the Broadway
[02:24.480 --> 02:28.920]  Avenue boom happened, there was a dispensary every block. It was dispensary and a Starbucks
[02:28.920 --> 02:33.280]  every block. And then all the Starbucks survived, but half of those dispensaries disappeared
[02:33.280 --> 02:39.520]  quite quickly. Yep. Or they all became a different Shane dispensary. Yes. Yes. They were all
[02:39.520 --> 02:43.960]  eaten up. All right. We're going to get ourselves back on track. Uh, since you were polite enough
[02:43.960 --> 02:48.720]  to ask, I am smoking garlic banger live batter tonight. I love those garlicky turps. It's
[02:48.720 --> 02:52.600]  got a nice mellow buzz. That's why maybe I'm a little bit slower than usual. I know
[02:52.600 --> 02:56.960]  I'm kind of slow all the time, dude. It is so good. It settles me down. It's like nice
[02:56.960 --> 03:01.160]  winter concentrates. It's like a, a savory Thanksgiving meal. So it's perfect for this
[03:01.160 --> 03:04.760]  time of year. It's been gone for a long time. I haven't been able to find it or get it.
[03:04.760 --> 03:09.480]  So I am really excited that the garlic banger is back. I just checked my stash. I'm out.
[03:09.480 --> 03:13.680]  Oh, I've got plenty. So come take a dab. Uh, we'll socially distance. I'll pass you the
[03:13.680 --> 03:18.880]  dab or I'll throw it at you. Uh, we'll do dabs like that. I also may smoke some flour
[03:18.880 --> 03:23.120]  here on the show. I've got some double dose flour that I picked up at a dispensary. I'm
[03:23.120 --> 03:28.500]  going to show it to the camera here. Yeah. It's not often that I see things that I bred
[03:28.500 --> 03:31.880]  on the menu at a dispensary. Somebody said, Hey, did you see the shop has your stuff?
[03:31.880 --> 03:35.200]  And I went, Oh man. And I looked it up and I was like, they really do. I found out who
[03:35.200 --> 03:39.920]  grew it. I approve of that grow. That cultivation facility does a good job. Uh, I went and checked
[03:39.920 --> 03:43.800]  out the flour. It looks really good. I'm showing it to the camera. Now, uh, this nugget
[03:43.800 --> 03:48.400]  is really dense. You can't see the density, but it's also really dry. It's got that Colorado
[03:48.400 --> 03:49.400]  crunch to it.
[03:49.400 --> 03:52.400]  Tap it on the microphone. Um, that'll do it.
[03:52.400 --> 03:56.360]  I don't know that. Yeah, this mic is not, it's not that kind of, maybe you can hear
[03:56.360 --> 04:01.800]  drop on the table. You can hear it hit the table. I heard that. Yeah. So it's really
[04:01.800 --> 04:08.520]  dense but a double dose. So I was there buying that and the, the lovely young bud tender
[04:08.520 --> 04:11.240]  lady, I walked in right away and she's like, do you know what you're looking for? And I
[04:11.240 --> 04:13.360]  was like, yeah, I want a quarter, a double dose. And she goes, Oh, you knew what you
[04:13.360 --> 04:17.520]  wanted right away. Do you know about the double dose? And I go, I know about the double dose.
[04:17.520 --> 04:20.560]  And she said, have you tried it? And I go, not yet. I'm excited to see what you guys
[04:20.560 --> 04:24.120]  did with it. And she goes, do you know anything about it? And I go, I know everything about
[04:24.120 --> 04:27.160]  it. I invented that strain. And she kind of looked at me and the other bud tender looked
[04:27.160 --> 04:28.160]  at me and I go, I'm a breeder.
[04:28.160 --> 04:31.680]  I make strains and you've got the double dose that I made. And you've got two others on
[04:31.680 --> 04:34.800]  your shelf here that I made. And they didn't know what to think about it. They didn't seem
[04:34.800 --> 04:38.720]  to care like just young bud tender girls, but they were kind of confused. They sold
[04:38.720 --> 04:42.440]  me my quarter and I was happy with it. I've been puffing on it occasionally. I don't smoke
[04:42.440 --> 04:47.480]  a lot of flowers. I'm kind of a dab snob, but having these bowls around when you're
[04:47.480 --> 04:51.000]  talking, when I get you going, I love to have something with my hands and smoking. This
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.400]  bowl is definitely going to help with my attention span. It will give me more time to let you
[04:55.400 --> 04:59.120]  talk and not feel like I got to jump in there so much.
[04:59.120 --> 05:02.240]  Those are great, but they take a minute.
[05:02.240 --> 05:07.000]  And it's also, it takes a minute to recover. So like I'm on a podcast and I do a big ripper
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.800]  of a dab and the next two minutes is just life going in my head and you're talking and
[05:11.800 --> 05:16.080]  I've got an audience and a camera and these lights, bro, they make dabs four times more
[05:16.080 --> 05:20.360]  intense. I'm serious that these lights just, you're just like, Oh, it's okay guys. I'm
[05:20.360 --> 05:24.800]  just really high. Take out these lights off me. But once you get used to it, it's cool.
[05:24.800 --> 05:26.880]  But man, that's a lot of light for a dab.
[05:27.360 --> 05:31.720]  Yeah. I've spent some time in front of these lights trying to get used to them. When I
[05:31.720 --> 05:36.560]  first turned them on, I was like, I bought the wrong too powerful light rig. Nope. Yeah.
[05:36.560 --> 05:40.720]  I'm more comfortable than I was when they showed up a few days ago.
[05:40.720 --> 05:43.820]  Takes a minute to adjust. I'm kind of comfortable on these lights. Now I love changing the color
[05:43.820 --> 05:46.600]  behind me and playing with these lights. I'm getting the temperature of the light color
[05:46.600 --> 05:48.920]  dialed in. I'm using the MacBook today.
[05:48.920 --> 05:50.480]  It was just audio. That's for sure.
[05:50.480 --> 05:54.760]  Oh, wasn't it? I'm not using the 4k camera today. So I'm just on the MacBook since we're
[05:54.760 --> 05:59.240]  zooming. So I do apologize. I'm not in the lovely 4k. I did notice that I recorded a
[05:59.240 --> 06:03.680]  really nice 4k video. I posted it up to YouTube and then YouTube took it and squished it down
[06:03.680 --> 06:05.760]  and made it a shitty compression file.
[06:05.760 --> 06:11.040]  Ah, man, it was frustrating. I don't know what I clicked. I don't know what I did wrong.
[06:11.040 --> 06:16.120]  I loaded it up as 4k. I was pretty sure, but we did not get 4k out of that bad bitch, but
[06:16.120 --> 06:20.080]  that's how it went. Oh, well, shout out to YouTube. I'm just happy that we're there.
[06:20.080 --> 06:22.760]  That's all.
[06:22.760 --> 06:26.680]  I'm reaching for some notes because I'm trying to do Patreon. I've got the notes on my phone.
[06:26.680 --> 06:30.960]  There we go. Mike, you want to segue into doing Patreon shout outs?
[06:30.960 --> 06:34.680]  We most certainly can. Would you like to do the honors, my man?
[06:34.680 --> 06:37.840]  Let's do this. This is the portion of the show where we give shout outs and say thanks
[06:37.840 --> 06:42.900]  to a few kind folks who support the show on Patreon. I call my crew the Ivory Army. Let's

[06:55.800 --> 06:58.920]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to Mobius Grows. What's up, bro? I hope you're
[06:58.920 --> 07:03.320]  doing well. Let's send a thank you shout out to Uncle GG. Let's send a shout out to Dominic
[07:03.320 --> 07:06.800]  C. I want to send a special thank you shout out to Kes Burton. What's up, bro? I know
[07:06.800 --> 07:10.240]  what you're doing. Thank you for all your work with the vets. I do respect that. Let's

[07:13.920 --> 07:18.260]  a thank you shout out to Kurt Z. And last, but certainly not motherfucking least, I want
[07:18.260 --> 07:23.680]  to send a thank you shout out to my fellow Cannabuzz buddy, Zoso J. Big thanks and big
[07:23.680 --> 07:27.300]  shout out to all of those folks for supporting the show on Patreon. If you'd like to support
[07:27.300 --> 07:32.620]  the show on Patreon, all you have to do is visit patreon.com forward slash grow from
[07:32.620 --> 07:36.680]  your heart. All of the information will be right there on the screen, in the video description,
[07:36.680 --> 07:41.560]  in the show notes. And I will also include Mike's Patreon link there so you can support
[07:41.560 --> 07:45.380]  White Mike on the show. And this is the part of the show where I am polite enough to pass
[07:45.440 --> 07:49.520]  it over to Mike and let him do his Patreon shout outs. Take it away, buddy.
[07:49.520 --> 07:52.700]  Thanks man. I just wanted to give a shout out to a couple of people supporting me on
[07:52.700 --> 07:58.040]  Patreon this month. A big shout out to Chris Sterling. Shout out to the Grow From Your
[07:58.040 --> 08:04.380]  Heart podcast. I really appreciate their support. Papa Z, thank you very much. OG Purple Thumb,
[08:04.380 --> 08:09.460]  Farmer Z, Mobius Grows. These lights wouldn't be here without y'all. I really appreciate
[08:09.460 --> 08:12.340]  the support. Thank you very much.
[08:12.340 --> 08:13.340]  All of Mike here.
[08:13.340 --> 08:20.160]  All of our Patreon supporters. That really, really, really hits nice this time of year.
[08:20.160 --> 08:23.140]  We appreciate you guys' support. Thank you so much.
[08:23.140 --> 08:27.540]  Yeah, we should give them an extra shout out because a lot of people, they're in weird
[08:27.540 --> 08:31.700]  situations in these times. And instead of buying a gift or a bag of herb or a bag of
[08:31.700 --> 08:38.320]  seeds or whatever, a bag of fucking noodles, they decided to send some funds your way and
[08:38.320 --> 08:43.300]  my way. So that is noticed and it is appreciated. Thank you guys. I do appreciate it. I do
[08:44.260 --> 08:48.380]  notice all of that. Mike notices it, especially during the holidays. It does help out. And
[08:48.380 --> 08:51.780]  Mike, you said a name that I don't know that I recognize. You might be getting a supporter
[08:51.780 --> 08:54.620]  that doesn't contribute to me. So that's fucking cool, man.
[08:54.620 --> 08:55.620]  Nice.
[08:55.620 --> 08:58.380]  Yeah. Their name may pop up, but I haven't seen one of those names yet. So that is pretty
[08:58.380 --> 09:06.140]  cool. I appreciate that. All right. You're going to be okay over there, buddy?
[09:06.140 --> 09:09.660]  It's that vape pen, man. It gets me right in the throat. It might have been a couple
[09:09.660 --> 09:10.660]  of big dabs.
[09:10.660 --> 09:16.260]  I was going to say, you took a dab before the show that you coughed. I thought it was
[09:16.260 --> 09:20.660]  rude so I didn't record it because I thought I may have to call your wife and be like,
[09:20.660 --> 09:25.460]  hey, Mike's passed out downstairs. You got to go check on him. And then you looked at
[09:25.460 --> 09:29.900]  the camera, you kind of looked at where the camera might be and you're like, that took
[09:29.900 --> 09:33.900]  me places. I was like, dude, you're not even fucking in there right now. It was kind of
[09:33.900 --> 09:37.660]  nice to see. I was a little bit jealous. So yeah, that's why you're coughing. Don't blame
[09:37.660 --> 09:40.340]  that damn dab pen.
[09:41.020 --> 09:45.700]  It's been a long day. And those two dabs I took when we fired up the zoom with the first
[09:45.700 --> 09:50.420]  two dabs of the day. So they did take me places.
[09:50.420 --> 09:55.780]  You said earlier, it's a Saturday. So it didn't take long for me to be firing up the dab nail
[09:55.780 --> 10:00.620]  today. It was definitely a well-deserved weekend to kind of take some dabs. And I still got
[10:00.620 --> 10:03.300]  plenty of shit done, but boy, I was ripped doing it.
[10:03.300 --> 10:06.900]  I did two kids on COVID. There's no weekends no more. There's no nothing.
[10:07.220 --> 10:11.740]  I'm going to clear up. You said two kids on COVID, not with. I know that the internet
[10:11.740 --> 10:16.100]  is a bitch. So we're just going to know he didn't say with, he said on during he's got
[10:16.100 --> 10:19.540]  two kids during times.
[10:19.540 --> 10:23.980]  There's only two time periods in my life. Now there's one that's awake and when they're
[10:23.980 --> 10:29.460]  asleep, that's it. There's not night, there's not day. There's not week. There's no weekend.
[10:29.460 --> 10:33.780]  I thought you were going to say before COVID and during COVID, but I was like, what about
[10:33.780 --> 10:36.540]  before kids and after kids? Aren't those time periods?
[10:36.540 --> 10:40.820]  When they're awake and when they're asleep, bro, that's it. It's really all there is.
[10:40.820 --> 10:44.940]  Some of the text messages you send me, I laugh inside a little bit and I'm like that poor
[10:44.940 --> 10:47.740]  guy.
[10:47.740 --> 10:50.740]  If you don't have kids, it can't be explained.
[10:50.740 --> 10:54.900]  I've got one. I've got a 17 year old daughter. Our adventures are way different. You've got
[10:54.900 --> 11:00.580]  two young little boys. I've got a big girl, different adventures, but yes, you just spend
[11:00.580 --> 11:06.020]  a lot of time staring at a wall going, what do I do or say about this one?
[11:06.020 --> 11:10.020]  Yep. Today, one of them grabs a handful of Mac and cheese and just pelted his brother
[11:10.020 --> 11:11.020]  with it.
[11:11.020 --> 11:15.820]  Well, I bet that about 40 years ago.
[11:15.820 --> 11:21.860]  Oh no, I'm sure I pulled something similar with my brother, but just watching it happens.
[11:21.860 --> 11:28.220]  I come around the corner and I see him wind up and pitch. I didn't see the lead up to
[11:28.620 --> 11:34.100]  the other brother was pretty calm when he got hit in the side of the face with Mac and
[11:34.100 --> 11:35.100]  cheese.
[11:35.100 --> 11:38.100]  Merry Christmas, your Mac and cheese.
[11:38.100 --> 11:41.220]  Shake your head and get the wipes out and start getting the cheese out of the carpet.
[11:41.220 --> 11:45.100]  Oh man. So do you clean up the kid or the carpet first? Which one goes first? The kid
[11:45.100 --> 11:49.180]  or the carpet? Yeah, right. Because the kid's just going to continue to get fucking dirtier.
[11:49.180 --> 11:53.620]  I wash the kid in the tub for free. I wash the carpets, like 300 bucks to rent the thing
[11:53.620 --> 11:58.420]  and the soap and the day and the moving the furniture. Fuck all that. Kid can wait.
[11:58.420 --> 12:03.980]  I've got a visual in my head of you holding each kid up and the wife out there with just
[12:03.980 --> 12:08.460]  the sprayer just hosing on the fuck down.
[12:08.460 --> 12:11.340]  The dad lawn sprayer gun. I just see you.
[12:11.340 --> 12:12.340]  Yep.
[12:12.340 --> 12:13.340]  Yep.
[12:13.340 --> 12:14.340]  Yep.
[12:14.340 --> 12:17.340]  Joint hanging out of your mouth. Mike doesn't smoke around the kids, but in my visual, that's
[12:17.340 --> 12:21.580]  how it's fucking going. It's my visual. I get to do whatever I want in my visuals.
[12:21.580 --> 12:27.540]  That's a good thing. They like it when we ramble. This show is far ready. We've needed
[12:27.540 --> 12:31.860]  this. I've done a couple of pretty intense shows. I did a tester episode telling everybody
[12:31.860 --> 12:35.660]  what I expect about testers. Then another episode talking about lights. It's time to
[12:35.660 --> 12:37.740]  cut loose and have Mike on for a moment.
[12:37.740 --> 12:38.740]  Exactly.
[12:38.740 --> 12:42.100]  The background is purple. What are we going to do? We're going to get all intense with
[12:42.100 --> 12:46.020]  a purple background. You got to enjoy the purple vibes, dude.
[12:46.020 --> 12:49.820]  Loving the purple vibes. The blue the other night looked crispy as fuck too.
[12:49.820 --> 12:53.940]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that. A shout out to the Patreon folks. I
[12:53.940 --> 12:58.020]  got sidetracked when I was saying without all the Patreon folks, we wouldn't look this
[12:58.020 --> 13:01.820]  good. My setup wouldn't look near this good. I wouldn't have the Joe Rogan mic. I wouldn't
[13:01.820 --> 13:05.780]  have these damn lights. I got a love hate relationship with these lights right here
[13:05.780 --> 13:10.380]  and the wall definitely wouldn't change colors. Thank you guys. We do appreciate that.
[13:10.380 --> 13:14.060]  No, the wall does change colors. You guys keep watching. I got more stuff up my sleeve
[13:14.060 --> 13:18.500]  too. It's just not time to reveal it yet. I'm learning all these toys.
[13:18.500 --> 13:23.060]  I've seen it. It's coming together really beautifully. Folks, just stay tuned. You're
[13:23.060 --> 13:26.380]  going to love some of the new developments.
[13:26.380 --> 13:31.660]  I did buy, what is slowing me down a little bit? Yeah, well I did buy another computer
[13:31.660 --> 13:38.260]  and Apple is taking four to six weeks to build that computer for me, but once it's here,
[13:38.260 --> 13:41.420]  the show, you'll see more improvement. There'll be more options for more things. I just can't
[13:41.420 --> 13:46.340]  do, this computer can only handle so much. So right now I'm limited a little bit. I bought
[13:46.340 --> 13:49.420]  new cameras and things and new recording equipment and the computer was like, well,
[13:49.420 --> 13:53.300]  that's cute. I was like, oh yeah, I got to upgrade to you too. Sorry. So there is a new
[13:53.300 --> 13:58.820]  computer coming, but Apple is, that's Apple. They're building it. I ordered, I clicked
[13:58.820 --> 14:02.500]  exactly what I wanted in this machine. So it's coming for me. It's just, they're going
[14:02.500 --> 14:06.660]  to, yeah, they got to put in the pieces. They got to screw in all the parts. So yeah. Shout
[14:06.660 --> 14:12.660]  out to Reefer Madness for the help. Also gave me some tech advice buying that. Nice. Yeah.
[14:12.660 --> 14:17.820]  I got the perfect machine. I feel like. Talk about it when it gets here. I'm excited, but
[14:17.820 --> 14:20.820]  Patreon helped for that a lot, heavily. I wouldn't have, definitely.
[14:20.820 --> 14:22.740]  Mike Lugino That's fine. That's how I feel about the lights.
[14:22.740 --> 14:26.420]  As soon as I got them set up, I knew I had exactly the right thing I wanted.
[14:26.420 --> 14:28.620]  Jared Ranere It's so awesome. And you know, yeah, I watched
[14:28.620 --> 14:33.180]  so many YouTube videos and when I typed in, is this the machine I want for this? And it
[14:33.180 --> 14:36.980]  was like, this is the number one rated machine that blew video editing out of the way or
[14:36.980 --> 14:41.940]  out of the water. And I was like, that's, we're buying this. Here we go. Yeah. All right,
[14:41.940 --> 14:42.940]  Mike.
[14:42.940 --> 14:43.940]  Mike Lugino Next piece of my world is going to be a new
[14:43.940 --> 14:50.220]  mic. This thing's tiny. Maybe a new mic stand first, then a new mic. We'll see.
[14:50.220 --> 14:51.860]  Jared Ranere You can have the one that's on the table
[14:51.860 --> 14:54.060]  over there. Just come pick it up. It'll get the mic closer to your face.
[14:54.060 --> 14:55.060]  Mike Lugino I got microphone envy, buddy.
[14:55.060 --> 14:56.060]  Jared Ranere Yeah.
[14:56.060 --> 14:57.700]  Mike Lugino That Joe Rogan mic is pimp.
[14:57.700 --> 15:00.220]  Jared Ranere Yeah. I'm on here twice a week. You're on
[15:00.220 --> 15:02.460]  like once a month. So, you know, it adds up.
[15:02.460 --> 15:04.940]  Mike Lugino I'd like to be on here twice a week, but
[15:04.940 --> 15:06.980]  Jared Ranere I'm not holding it against you. We just talked
[15:06.980 --> 15:08.660]  about the savages that you deal with.
[15:08.660 --> 15:11.140]  Mike Lugino I wants to be, but peeps, I really, really
[15:11.140 --> 15:12.140]  do.
[15:12.140 --> 15:13.140]  Jared Ranere They want you.
[15:13.140 --> 15:14.700]  Mike Lugino Which brings us full circle back to Patreon.
[15:14.700 --> 15:19.580]  It's way easier to find time to record when you're like, man, I'm getting paid to do this
[15:19.580 --> 15:20.580]  now.
[15:20.580 --> 15:21.580]  Jared Ranere Yes.
[15:21.580 --> 15:22.580]  Mike Lugino Stop fucking off.
[15:22.580 --> 15:23.580]  Jared Ranere Yep. It definitely, you make tighter notes.
[15:23.580 --> 15:27.060]  You'd make a tighter schedule and you're like, oh, Patreon is how much this month? I am definitely
[15:27.060 --> 15:28.700]  going to deliver. Like, yeah.
[15:28.700 --> 15:29.700]  Mike Lugino Yep.
[15:29.700 --> 15:30.700]  Jared Ranere Yeah. Thank you guys.
[15:30.700 --> 15:32.500]  Mike Lugino I think you're going on five years. You've
[15:32.500 --> 15:33.500]  never missed a show.
[15:33.500 --> 15:35.580]  Jared Ranere I think it's closer to six or seven to tell
[15:35.580 --> 15:39.180]  you the truth. I could look in the phone. I've got the exact date in the phone somewhere,
[15:39.180 --> 15:41.860]  but I don't want to scroll through while we're on here. And I've got the show notes
[15:41.860 --> 15:47.540]  on the phone. So we do have a purpose. There is a method to the madness we have gathered
[15:47.540 --> 15:52.380]  here today for a real reason. No, it's not a wedding. It is not a funeral. There has
[15:52.380 --> 15:58.700]  been some news that I don't completely understand. And social media definitely doesn't completely
[15:58.700 --> 16:01.980]  understand. And I thought that if I don't understand it and social media doesn't understand
[16:01.980 --> 16:06.660]  it, there's a large portion of my audience that doesn't understand. I hate to admit that
[16:06.660 --> 16:13.300]  I am politically ignorant. I didn't get into politics. I didn't care about politics until
[16:13.300 --> 16:18.420]  fucking obviously right cannabis legalization. Luckily, I met Mike and I got involved in
[16:18.420 --> 16:24.340]  a dispensary that had political issues. The owner of that dispensary had legal and political
[16:24.340 --> 16:30.960]  issues. I met Mike. Mike kind of showed me how to handle political issues and develop
[16:30.960 --> 16:34.180]  my own opinions and thoughts around these political things with the little information
[16:34.180 --> 16:40.020]  that I've got. So I didn't care about politics and like legalization of anything. I didn't
[16:40.020 --> 16:44.220]  think it mattered. But now that I'm involved in the cannabis industry, now that I'm a I'm
[16:44.220 --> 16:48.980]  kind of got a business, I've got multiple companies. I'm a taxpayer. Yeah, it took me.
[16:48.980 --> 16:53.300]  Now I understand why people care so much. The decisions that those people make heavily
[16:53.300 --> 16:59.260]  affect my today, my tomorrow. And more importantly, probably the decisions made today by our leaders
[16:59.420 --> 17:04.460]  are going to affect me mostly in five to 1015 years is what I'm starting to learn. And that's
[17:04.460 --> 17:08.540]  when I'm not going to be old enough to fucking bounce back and recover and just say, sorry,
[17:08.540 --> 17:11.660]  I'll just work harder and make more money next month. I'll be like, I'm fucking old.
[17:11.660 --> 17:14.940]  I'm retired. And now I'm fucked. That's how it's going to be if I don't stay on top of
[17:14.940 --> 17:19.340]  it. So I started paying more attention. But I don't understand completely what is going
[17:19.340 --> 17:24.140]  on with this bill. I don't understand how it all works. I don't that Mike does. I know
[17:24.140 --> 17:27.420]  there's a lot of my people out there listening that are already saying I don't even need
[17:27.420 --> 17:30.540]  to listen. I understand this better than Mike, but still hang out with us, you guys,
[17:30.540 --> 17:33.660]  because you may learn something. We want your feedback. Let me know how we did on this. But
[17:33.660 --> 17:39.980]  Mike, I'm going to quit rambling. And let's talk about the thing called the more act. It is a house
[17:39.980 --> 17:46.140]  bill. It just recently was voted on. So I guess my first question is, what happened?
[17:47.500 --> 17:54.220]  Okay, so the House of Representatives is one half of Congress. There's the house and the Senate.
[17:55.020 --> 18:01.020]  And the House of Representatives has a whole truckload of people in it. The Senate,
[18:01.020 --> 18:05.980]  only two senators per state. So there's total of 100 senators. There's way more people in the House
[18:05.980 --> 18:11.420]  of Representatives. The House of Representatives just voted on what they're calling the more act.
[18:11.420 --> 18:17.820]  It's an acronym for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2019.
[18:18.700 --> 18:29.580]  Or the short, the more act of 2019. It removes or if it's passed into law, eventually it would
[18:29.580 --> 18:37.500]  remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act, completely deschedule cannabis federally,
[18:38.140 --> 18:47.100]  leaving what to do about cannabis legality strictly up to the states. Sort of how alcohol is now.
[18:48.140 --> 18:55.820]  Where you talk and say, we want state licensed stores only in three, two beer in places like
[18:55.820 --> 19:01.020]  California, you can get vodka at seven 11. Like it just totally leaves it up to the states.
[19:02.300 --> 19:10.220]  The more act also does a couple other things. It would set a 5% federal tax on cannabis.
[19:11.100 --> 19:16.940]  Some of that money would go into a trust fund for various areas that were harmed by the war
[19:16.940 --> 19:22.060]  on drugs. Other portions of that money would go to the Small Business Administration,
[19:22.780 --> 19:29.980]  which would have loans and services available for startup cannabis businesses, just like they do for
[19:29.980 --> 19:38.220]  all other businesses. It would prohibit the denial of federal public benefits to a person on the
[19:38.220 --> 19:44.700]  basis of certain cannabis related conduct or convictions and prohibit the denial of benefits
[19:44.700 --> 19:49.260]  and protections under immigration laws. Like right now, if you're Canadian and you've been
[19:49.260 --> 19:54.300]  arrested for having pot and gotten a ticket for it back before it was legal in Canada,
[19:54.300 --> 19:58.540]  and you try to come to the US and they say, have you ever been charged with a cannabis crime? And
[19:58.540 --> 20:06.700]  you say, yes, you don't get to come to the US. It's a super obnoxious rule. If the Moore Act
[20:06.700 --> 20:11.820]  gets passed into law, that's history too. So there's a lot of good stuff here. There's some
[20:11.820 --> 20:17.660]  less good stuff. Like anything Congress does, they got to fuck it up a little bit.
[20:18.700 --> 20:23.260]  But for the most part, this is a pretty good bill. It's a huge step in the right direction.
[20:24.220 --> 20:28.380]  Neither part of Congress, the House or the Senate has ever voted on something
[20:28.940 --> 20:37.020]  this sweeping as far as cannabis goes. So it is quite historic, even if it doesn't go anywhere,
[20:37.020 --> 20:43.340]  which is very likely. That's the negative side of this story. So the positive side is it's a
[20:43.340 --> 20:51.100]  pretty good bill. It's historic in what it does and how far it goes, but government.
[20:52.860 --> 20:58.300]  So the House of Representatives has voted and passed it. Now the Senate has to.
[20:59.500 --> 21:03.020]  The Senate is currently controlled by Mitch McConnell. Fuck you, Kentucky.
[21:03.980 --> 21:10.780]  And yeah, I meant that. I'm not going to edit it out. You're going to get hate mail.
[21:11.580 --> 21:23.980]  That's fine. Send hate mail to at Nemo Punk 15. Twitter. So here's where we stand now with the
[21:23.980 --> 21:30.140]  Moore Act and federal descheduling of cannabis. The House has passed it. Right now the Senate
[21:30.220 --> 21:35.660]  can choose to take it up or not for the bill to move forward at all. The Senate would have to
[21:35.660 --> 21:43.100]  choose to vote on it and pass it right now. Like I mentioned earlier, there's 100 senators total.
[21:43.820 --> 21:51.260]  Right now they're divided along a 52 to 48 split. There's 52 Republicans, 48 Democrats,
[21:51.820 --> 21:59.020]  which brings us to Georgia. The Georgia Senate race is currently in a runoff election.
[21:59.820 --> 22:03.340]  It looks like it's going to be the most expensive Senate race in history.
[22:05.180 --> 22:09.980]  Both sides are pouring money into Georgia right now, attempting to lock down those two Senate
[22:09.980 --> 22:16.700]  seats because those Senate seats will either lead to a continuation of the 52-48 split
[22:17.420 --> 22:23.420]  in favor of the Republicans or lead to an even 50-50 split Republican and Democrat.
[22:24.380 --> 22:28.220]  If both of the Georgia Senate seats go to Democrats,
[22:29.260 --> 22:35.500]  is the only way the Moore Act goes through the Senate is the conventional wisdom right now.
[22:37.660 --> 22:42.620]  I'm not positive what the two Republicans running for those seats have said about cannabis, but
[22:43.180 --> 22:46.780]  in general, the Republican Party has not at all been supportive here.
[22:47.580 --> 22:54.540]  When the Moore Act passed in the House, I think only five or 10 Republicans voted for it.
[22:58.460 --> 23:03.820]  It's not popular among Republican elected representatives. That's just how it is in
[23:03.820 --> 23:13.660]  the U.S. right now. If this goes forward, we need the two Georgia seats in Senate to both go Democrat
[23:14.460 --> 23:22.940]  and then the Senate to choose to read the Moore Act and vote on it. If it passes in the Senate,
[23:22.940 --> 23:29.820]  it's likely to be a 50-50 tie, which would mean the vice president settles the tiebreaker.
[23:32.140 --> 23:36.700]  The way everything looks to be playing out right now, that would be the sponsor of this act,
[23:37.420 --> 23:43.660]  Vice President-elect Harris. It's a really, really long shot that this bill goes anywhere.
[23:45.500 --> 23:51.100]  It's only likely path to getting signed by the president is if Georgia goes to blue Senate
[23:51.100 --> 23:58.860]  seats, which is super unlikely. Then we happen to get a 50-50 tie, and then the vice president-elect
[23:58.860 --> 24:07.660]  chooses to vote with the Democrats. It's a long, long road. Where we are right now is still
[24:07.660 --> 24:12.300]  definitely worth celebrating because it's never happened before. A lot of people never thought
[24:12.300 --> 24:18.060]  it would happen, period. Did all that make sense? That all mostly made sense to me.
[24:21.340 --> 24:24.300]  I had three questions. What the hell happened? What's going to happen next?
[24:25.100 --> 24:30.380]  Then I think you worked close to my third question is, what happens if this works? Do we want this?
[24:30.380 --> 24:35.820]  I know we do want federal legalization, but what if this does go through, Mike? How do things
[24:35.820 --> 24:39.340]  change for us? How do things change for our dispensary worker friends?
[24:41.100 --> 24:49.260]  The change will be slow. Right now, Colorado already has a ton of rules in place for our
[24:49.980 --> 24:57.820]  cannabis industry, and none of them would change. Right now, I guess the anti-pop
[24:58.540 --> 25:04.780]  movement's best hope is that the federal government will remember that cannabis is
[25:04.780 --> 25:11.180]  illegal federally, and technically every marijuana business in the country is violating federal law.
[25:11.980 --> 25:18.140]  At any point, the Department of Justice or the DEA or any of those bureaucratic agencies could
[25:18.140 --> 25:25.420]  decide to just decimate our industry. If the Moore Act passes, that threat goes away.
[25:28.140 --> 25:36.380]  All of a sudden, 280E, the really horrible tax bill that says because cannabis is a schedule
[25:36.380 --> 25:44.540]  one narcotic, we can't deduct payroll, normal business expenses from federal taxes, that goes
[25:44.540 --> 25:52.140]  away. Cannabis gets descheduled. It's no longer a schedule one narcotic. 280E doesn't apply anymore.
[25:53.580 --> 26:00.140]  This bill has the potential to have major implications across the cannabis industry.
[26:01.100 --> 26:07.100]  If we can make those deductions, that's where the health insurance money goes. That's where
[26:07.100 --> 26:12.460]  the payroll money goes. It's all going to federal taxes. If that's not true anymore,
[26:12.780 --> 26:21.740]  yep, banking gets better. Business loans, just like normal. You recently ran into a thing
[26:22.300 --> 26:27.580]  where you had trouble with banking stuff. All those headaches go away for people.
[26:27.580 --> 26:32.460]  Yeah, all they have to do is type in. They can go to the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division
[26:32.460 --> 26:36.620]  website and type in your name, and it will tell you if you have a marijuana enforcement division
[26:36.620 --> 26:40.860]  badge. If you're going to the bank to apply for a loan or for a bank account, you have to give them
[26:40.860 --> 26:45.260]  your social security number. They can type that in, and that will pop up right on the MED website,
[26:45.260 --> 26:49.740]  and it tells you right away. That person is, and mine says, right there, it was clear on the screen,
[26:49.740 --> 26:54.220]  she showed it to me. You have this badge. I was like, oh yeah. That messed with my banking.
[26:54.220 --> 27:05.100]  Had to do some hoops. Yep. Our cannabis laws in this country have sort of infected everything.
[27:05.260 --> 27:12.780]  Prohibition was such a bad concept, and the people in power so desperately wanted it to work that
[27:12.780 --> 27:19.980]  they kept trying and kept trying and kept trying. It's literally affected everything. It's affected
[27:19.980 --> 27:25.820]  public assistance. It's affected housing. It's affected scholarships. It's affected education.
[27:25.820 --> 27:33.900]  It's affected policing. It's affected retirement programs and how police operate.
[27:35.580 --> 27:43.980]  The public's relationship with the police. This bill is a major, major step towards undoing a lot
[27:43.980 --> 27:53.260]  of that. Nice. If this bill gets passed, it's not like all that's over tomorrow or the day after it's
[27:53.260 --> 28:01.660]  passed. It's just a good next step. Not a good first step, a good next step. We still got a long
[28:01.660 --> 28:08.940]  way to go. For the MORE Act to get through the Senate, basically everybody that hears this needs
[28:08.940 --> 28:14.380]  to call their elected representative. Hop on Google. Hop on your phone real quick. Type in,
[28:14.940 --> 28:20.540]  who's my senator? It'll give you a name and contact info. Contact them however you're
[28:20.540 --> 28:30.060]  comfortable. Email, phone, fax, TikTok, whatever you want. Send them a tweet. Just, hey, I care
[28:30.060 --> 28:36.940]  about the MORE Act and I vote. Please vote to pass the MORE Act. Please vote yes on holding
[28:36.940 --> 28:43.020]  hearings on the MORE Act. Yes, I support this. The more your elected representatives hear that,
[28:43.020 --> 28:48.460]  the more likely they are to vote for it. I guarantee you the other side is making those calls.
[28:49.260 --> 28:55.340]  I've already seen quite a few social media posts trying to get votes on the MORE Act stopped.
[28:55.980 --> 29:03.740]  Project Sam, the nation's big anti-cannabis group, is claiming victory for getting the vote
[29:03.740 --> 29:08.620]  delayed till now. They were going to vote on it before the November elections and it got
[29:08.620 --> 29:16.060]  delayed till after, purposefully. That's not a victory. That's a delay. Yeah, this is the only
[29:16.060 --> 29:23.420]  victories they get. They lost pretty big on election night. Five more states joined us legal.
[29:24.300 --> 29:28.620]  They're prolonging their defeat. That's all you're doing. We're going to win. You're prolonging your
[29:28.620 --> 29:34.780]  defeat. Give it up. Generation Dreadlocks has taken over, dude. They drive me nuts because
[29:35.900 --> 29:39.500]  I mean, we really have moved past, are we going to legalize it? Are we not?
[29:40.300 --> 29:46.060]  That cat's out the bag. It ain't going back in. I don't want a lot of things, but if you tell me I
[29:46.060 --> 29:50.060]  can't have them, fuck you. No, I want them. That's just how life works. I feel like that's what
[29:50.060 --> 29:53.740]  prohibition does to things. If you put a red button right there, I don't care about the red
[29:53.740 --> 29:58.620]  button. If you put, do not press this red button on the button, when you walk away, I'm going to
[29:58.620 --> 30:02.620]  press it just to see what happens. Now it's a struggle every day. Yeah. Prohibition works the
[30:02.620 --> 30:07.180]  same way, dude. If it wasn't prohibited and treated like something we can't have, it wouldn't be such
[30:07.180 --> 30:12.700]  a big deal. Yeah. Just legalize it federally everywhere. Let us do what we want. We're adults.
[30:12.780 --> 30:20.860]  We can do our thing. It's time. It's really, really time. I don't think there's any set of
[30:20.860 --> 30:29.820]  circumstances that lead to a major reversal nationally on cannabis policy. It's too
[30:29.820 --> 30:34.700]  widespread. It's too common. It's too popular. It's too embraced and it's too ingrained now,
[30:35.420 --> 30:41.340]  but the anti-group still hasn't figured this out. Instead of joining the conversation and
[30:41.340 --> 30:47.820]  helping us make smart workable regulations, they're still being obstinate and fighting
[30:47.820 --> 30:53.660]  tooth and nail every step of progress. It is what it is. They're definitely making those calls. They
[30:53.660 --> 30:59.820]  care a lot. They make 15, 20 calls a day. They send out a shit ton of emails, but I say it all
[30:59.820 --> 31:06.220]  the time. The cannabis community is the largest voting block in the US. If we would all just focus
[31:06.220 --> 31:12.620]  for a minute and unify in any way, we could dominate politics for the next 30 years.
[31:13.500 --> 31:19.340]  Right now is a really easy opportunity to shoot an email at your Senator and flood those inboxes
[31:19.340 --> 31:25.180]  and phone banks with, hey, I support the MORE Act. You should too. I vote. I'm going to remember how
[31:25.180 --> 31:29.900]  you voted on this the next time you're up for re-election. There you go. Yep. Let them know.
[31:29.900 --> 31:35.580]  I may not like you if you don't do this right. Yep. Yeah. We employ them. We vote for them.
[31:37.180 --> 31:43.580]  I'm already writing an email to Hickenlooper. He's got some famous not great cannabis quotes,
[31:43.580 --> 31:49.420]  and now he's our elected Senator in Colorado. He better be interested in voting us on the
[31:49.420 --> 31:52.940]  MORE Act or he's going to eat my shit every day until he's at office.
[31:54.220 --> 31:58.940]  Yeah. If you're Colorado, you got to be on Team Green. We're the pioneers here.
[31:59.580 --> 32:03.980]  We are the pioneers. All right, guys. You know what to do. You've got to send your emails to
[32:03.980 --> 32:09.020]  your elected officials and let them know, vote yes on the MORE Act. Do encourage the vote on the
[32:09.020 --> 32:14.780]  MORE Act. We do want this. Tell your people to vote on that. Tell all your friends to message
[32:14.780 --> 32:19.900]  their Senators and their Congress folk as well. We need all the people, all the support we can get.
[32:20.460 --> 32:23.580]  Mike, I don't have any more notes. Do you have any more stuff that we need to cover on this,
[32:23.580 --> 32:29.340]  or is it time to ramble for a minute? Just one last plea. If you happen to be in Georgia,
[32:30.060 --> 32:35.100]  make sure you vote in these runoffs. Please make sure you vote. Make sure your friends vote. Make
[32:35.100 --> 32:42.300]  sure your anti-votes. Please, please, please, please. Cletus, I'm looking at you. Please,
[32:42.300 --> 32:48.140]  please, please. Go vote, Cletus. Get everybody in the truck and go vote, Cletus. Get them all
[32:48.140 --> 32:54.540]  in the truck. Go vote. Do it. Go vote. All right, Mike, I feel like that was a really good podcast.
[32:54.540 --> 32:58.860]  We gave them a lot of good rambles. We gave them some good political talk. You only said one thing.
[32:59.420 --> 33:02.540]  You only said one thing that's going to piss a few people off, and I think that's going to go over
[33:02.540 --> 33:10.620]  well. I really understand when people ask and say, this is a cannabis show. I'd like to keep
[33:10.620 --> 33:17.340]  the politics out of cannabis, but it's cannabis news, education, and conversation. We exist in
[33:17.340 --> 33:23.500]  the world. Politics is part of the world. That is it. People are in jail for consuming cannabis,
[33:23.500 --> 33:28.380]  and we can help that not be a thing. I don't think anybody should ever go to jail for consuming a
[33:28.380 --> 33:31.740]  plant that grew out of the ground. I think you should be able, I'm not going to go too far,
[33:31.740 --> 33:36.140]  you should be able to do what you want. As long as what you're doing doesn't hurt me or the earth
[33:36.140 --> 33:42.620]  or cause any crazy ripples, do your thing. If you want to smoke battery acid and fucking bleach,
[33:43.180 --> 33:46.780]  have a good time, buddy. Just don't do it in my backyard where I got to deal with you,
[33:46.780 --> 33:52.380]  and we're cool. I think we should all be able to do what we want. That's part of, if they make
[33:52.380 --> 33:56.060]  rules that let us not able to do that, we've got to speak up. That's part of, I've got a platform.
[33:56.060 --> 33:59.900]  I've got a microphone. I've got a smart friend. I would be doing a disservice if I didn't come
[33:59.900 --> 34:03.740]  on here and say, we've got a job to do. That's part of my job, not just to teach you how to grow,
[34:03.740 --> 34:08.940]  but then more people can grow. There'll be more cannabis around, more legal cannabis,
[34:08.940 --> 34:13.020]  better cannabis. That's part of my goal, is to get better cannabis out there for everybody.
[34:13.020 --> 34:17.180]  Yeah, if it's legal, you don't have to fucking drive from your house to your buddy's house to
[34:17.180 --> 34:20.940]  get in their car, and then drive to the grocery store in their car, and then go drive around the
[34:20.940 --> 34:24.940]  block a few times and drive the long way home so no one's following you. Drive that car into
[34:24.940 --> 34:29.420]  the garage, unload all this shit into your car in the garage, then drive your car home and take
[34:29.420 --> 34:33.500]  the long way home so you don't have to play all those dumb games anymore. You go to the grocery
[34:33.500 --> 34:37.100]  store, you buy what you need, you can go home and set up your tent and you grow like a pro.
[34:37.100 --> 34:41.660]  That's what we're trying to do. All right. Everything's better when it's legal, y'all.
[34:41.660 --> 34:48.780]  Everything's better, except the taxes. Okay, the taxes, but that's expected. Is there a downside
[34:48.780 --> 34:52.700]  if this does pass? I've got my own suspicions and fears that I don't want to open up those
[34:52.700 --> 34:59.660]  cans of worms on this episode, but is there a possible downside? I need to read which amendments
[34:59.660 --> 35:08.860]  were passed with it. Right now, worrying about a downside is silly because the downside to how the
[35:08.860 --> 35:15.900]  law exists currently is far greater than the downside that would exist if the law changed.
[35:16.780 --> 35:23.100]  But there was an amendment offered to it. I don't remember if it passed or not. I think it did, but
[35:23.660 --> 35:31.100]  not 100%. That is sort of like Colorado's barring people that have been convicted of
[35:31.100 --> 35:40.860]  drug and cannabis crimes. That's really fucked up. Yeah. That puts out some of the best talent
[35:40.940 --> 35:48.140]  right away. It was part of the conversation when Colorado and Washington first went legal.
[35:48.780 --> 35:55.660]  We specifically banned anyone that had gotten in trouble before because we were selling
[35:56.300 --> 36:03.020]  an idea that scared the shit out of white America. They're a lot less scared now in a lot
[36:03.020 --> 36:08.380]  of states. The conversations evolved drastically in the states that have legalized since Colorado
[36:08.380 --> 36:15.020]  and Washington to where the legal industries should be inclusive of everybody that was
[36:15.900 --> 36:22.380]  involved in the industry before it was legal. But in Colorado, still the five and 10 year ban exists.
[36:25.660 --> 36:31.100]  There was an amendment offered to the Moore Act that continued that federally. I don't remember
[36:31.100 --> 36:36.780]  what the specifics of it though were. I'd have to triple check. There's likely to be some not great
[36:37.740 --> 36:41.500]  undercurrents to this if it goes all the way through to passage.
[36:42.220 --> 36:48.300]  But that's a really long journey and there's plenty of time between now and then for edits.
[36:50.860 --> 36:54.060]  If there's a piece of it that you really hate or you can't live with,
[36:54.620 --> 36:59.420]  include that in your letter to your Senator. Hey, I really like this, but get rid of paragraph two.
[36:59.980 --> 37:04.300]  It's all I got to do. Real, real easy. It's editable still at this point.
[37:04.780 --> 37:08.220]  Yep. Excellent. All right. I've got a lot of learning to do still, Mike. I'm glad you're
[37:08.220 --> 37:11.900]  around to teach me about politics and the processes. When I was in school-
[37:11.900 --> 37:13.340]  I'll be pros in everything, bro.
[37:13.340 --> 37:15.740]  Did they did not teach me any of this stuff in school?
[37:18.220 --> 37:23.500]  Yeah. Some schools try, some schools don't. And I don't know which school you went to.
[37:24.380 --> 37:28.300]  I don't want to just... Pueblo's too small for us to shit on one of those schools.
[37:28.300 --> 37:29.340]  We'll hear about it every time we get sandwiched.
[37:29.340 --> 37:32.940]  Southern California schooling is when I should have learned about this. In school in those
[37:32.940 --> 37:35.980]  grades is when I should have learned this part. And I didn't get... Yeah.
[37:35.980 --> 37:40.300]  I think seventh and eighth are usually when people learned civics.
[37:41.340 --> 37:47.020]  But I mean, there's a huge... When you look at who votes and the vote totals,
[37:47.820 --> 37:55.020]  even in this last election where turnout was as high as it's ever been, if you add up Trump's score
[37:55.020 --> 38:00.540]  and Biden's score and all of the other people that ran for president's score, and then you compare
[38:00.540 --> 38:05.180]  that to the total number of Americans, the total number of voters is way fucking smaller.
[38:05.740 --> 38:12.060]  And it's complicated. It's hard to follow. It's annoying. It's super frustrating. The
[38:12.060 --> 38:18.860]  idea of compromise fucks with a lot of people's cognitive dissonance. And yeah, it's understandable.
[38:18.860 --> 38:21.500]  A lot of people don't follow this. A lot of people don't want to follow it.
[38:22.140 --> 38:23.500]  And that's what I'm here for.
[38:24.140 --> 38:27.900]  Eventually it just gives me like a... It's not a headache, but it's just like,
[38:27.980 --> 38:34.060]  a... I'm done hearing about it and it doesn't make sense. And that guy's an asshole. That guy's
[38:34.060 --> 38:39.740]  lying. That guy's cool, but nobody likes him. I don't know. It's like a fucking giant soap opera
[38:39.740 --> 38:44.380]  now. It used to be... It felt more political. Now it feels kind of soap opera-y. It's like WWF or
[38:44.380 --> 38:51.420]  WWE or whatever they call it now. I wasn't joking a couple episodes ago when I said my superpower is
[38:51.420 --> 38:54.460]  sort of being able to sit through these meetings and not lose my mind.
[38:56.460 --> 39:00.380]  I remember sitting at city council and I was looking at stuff in front of me.
[39:01.180 --> 39:06.700]  And it said very clearly on line one that we were going to have zero marijuana businesses.
[39:07.500 --> 39:12.140]  And then down on line 20, it said we could expect half a million dollars from our marijuana
[39:12.140 --> 39:18.620]  businesses. And no one else in the hearing, no one else in the room, there's like 50 adults,
[39:19.580 --> 39:23.260]  no one else picks up on this. And then they asked for public comment. And I was like,
[39:24.540 --> 39:28.140]  I got some comments. I was like, am I the only one in the room that's
[39:28.860 --> 39:36.220]  high enough to do math still? Like what the fuck is happening? And yeah, two nights later is when
[39:36.220 --> 39:40.620]  one of the city and city council people told me, hey, I'm going to step down next week.
[39:40.620 --> 39:46.220]  You should try to take my seat. If you're able to sit through this and follow the thread,
[39:46.380 --> 39:50.380]  like you can conquer the world. Basically. It's creepy.
[39:50.380 --> 39:55.020]  Yeah, that's not, I'm glad you're there for that. Mike, I was at a meeting a couple of days ago
[39:55.020 --> 40:00.300]  and my brain hit that point. I was like, is this done yet? Cause I am like, just, you know, it's
[40:00.300 --> 40:04.060]  probably as a former cigarette smoker, there's probably about that 40 minute mark. I can see
[40:04.060 --> 40:07.900]  it happen to you. I need a cigarette. My brain went, yeah, you've been here long enough. This
[40:07.900 --> 40:10.780]  is boring. Let's go do something different. And I think my-
[40:10.780 --> 40:15.100]  Every 55 minutes is how I built that nicotine program in my brain.
[40:15.100 --> 40:18.860]  Yeah. The, uh, the person on the other side of the table, I think they caught on cause they go,
[40:18.860 --> 40:22.140]  well, so you've been here for long enough. We'll go ahead and wrap up and get you out of here.
[40:22.140 --> 40:27.100]  And I was like, oh, did you just notice that my ADD just went, I'm done. Like, yeah. And city
[40:27.100 --> 40:31.740]  council meetings, dude. By the time I walk in, I'm like, this building's intimidating. I don't
[40:31.740 --> 40:38.220]  care about anybody here. Let's go. Like I'm done. One of the things that always made me laugh is at
[40:38.220 --> 40:44.540]  the start of the meeting, the room is packed, standing room only there's 18, 20 people standing
[40:44.540 --> 40:51.500]  up. Sometimes there's six or 10 people in the hallway. And usually 20 minutes into the meeting,
[40:52.140 --> 40:57.100]  the only people left in the room are required by law to be there being paid to be there.
[40:57.740 --> 41:04.780]  Or for one reason or another have some issue later in the meeting that they're desperate to talk
[41:04.780 --> 41:11.420]  about. But there's not 15 people left in the room. I mean, it's not standing room only anymore. It's,
[41:11.500 --> 41:15.580]  I mean, you can like lay down and, you know, kickbox and shit in the aisles.
[41:17.340 --> 41:20.940]  That echo happens in there. Everybody's just there for the first 15 minutes.
[41:21.500 --> 41:25.580]  They'll wait for the invocation. And then the, they're there to see the two people get their
[41:25.580 --> 41:31.500]  award for the week or whatever it is. And then everybody bails. Then you're left there alone
[41:31.500 --> 41:38.060]  with city government to say, or do whatever you want. It became natural to you. I watched you do
[41:38.060 --> 41:42.620]  it. It was pretty cool. It was pretty cool. And thank you. All right, Mike, we've been going for,
[41:42.620 --> 41:46.220]  Oh, go ahead, dude. I'll let you wrap that up. And then I was going to say, I encourage people
[41:46.220 --> 41:52.940]  seriously start right now. All of this stuff is happening online. And it looks like things are
[41:52.940 --> 41:56.860]  going to get a little more restrictive right now as we go into the deeper, deeper parts of winter.
[41:57.420 --> 42:01.900]  So all of these things are happening online. Even if you're part of the world, they were
[42:01.900 --> 42:07.260]  resistant to that for a minute. So take the time to figure out when your city, your town, or
[42:07.260 --> 42:13.180]  whatever meets on zoom and check those meetings out, figure out where you can add your two cents.
[42:13.740 --> 42:18.620]  Maybe it's an email. Maybe it's an issue that you care about. Maybe it's not even cannabis related,
[42:18.620 --> 42:24.300]  but if more people were involved, shit would be better. Oh yeah. Yep. Yeah. Cause they don't all
[42:24.300 --> 42:28.380]  have the same idea as us. They're living a different lifestyle than us. And yeah, they
[42:28.380 --> 42:31.580]  don't think about us when they make their decisions. A lot of them, I can't generalize like
[42:31.580 --> 42:38.860]  that. That's a, what is it? Councilman-ism. It can't be council person-ist. It, uh, one of the
[42:38.860 --> 42:44.540]  things that I like to try to remind myself is everybody on the planet has just as rich and
[42:44.540 --> 42:50.940]  interesting life as me. Like, I just don't know about it yet, but everybody's got their own shit
[42:50.940 --> 42:57.420]  going on and use that to your advantage, man. Relate to people. They relate to you too. Even
[42:57.420 --> 43:01.500]  if you don't think you do, like when you went to city council, you made an impression, even though
[43:01.500 --> 43:06.140]  you didn't feel like you belong there, feel comfortable there. When I had 10 or 15 people
[43:06.140 --> 43:12.060]  behind me, I had those city council people shitting bricks. They do not want somebody
[43:12.060 --> 43:17.500]  with the ability to bring friends to the meeting. That scares the hell out of elected officials.
[43:17.500 --> 43:21.020]  They definitely knew that our little cheering section there was there to support medical
[43:21.020 --> 43:26.220]  cannabis. They definitely understood that. Yep. And I was completely, I was professional and
[43:26.220 --> 43:31.820]  respectful and all I had to do was show up and smile. And we did make a presence. So that does work.
[43:32.700 --> 43:38.860]  Dude, when this started, I never thought we'd be here. And it looks like we might seriously see
[43:38.860 --> 43:46.140]  federal legalization in our lifetime. Yep. Where you and me can grow some herb and put it in a box
[43:46.140 --> 43:52.380]  and legally send it to a store shelf in New York or California or Oregon or France.
[43:53.340 --> 43:58.380]  Like we're headed there, man. We're really, really headed there. That's awesome. Yeah. So my friends
[43:58.380 --> 44:02.140]  in California that grow and my friends in New York that grow, we can all just trade products,
[44:02.140 --> 44:06.700]  just send a couple ounces around. That would be sweet. That would be cool. It'll be like
[44:06.700 --> 44:11.340]  everything else. There'll be a couple of spots around the country that are known for cannabis
[44:11.340 --> 44:15.900]  production, just like there are for wine production or fashion industry or whatever else.
[44:16.780 --> 44:21.500]  And we won't have people growing in their basement everywhere unless they want to.
[44:21.500 --> 44:27.420]  Yeah. No, life is so much better. I hope some people still want to. I hope they still want to.
[44:27.420 --> 44:31.980]  Never stop you basement bandits. Keep fucking doing your thing. Keep doing it. Every town
[44:31.980 --> 44:35.660]  has got to be. The best herb I've ever had came out of the basement. Yeah. Those basement buccaneers
[44:35.660 --> 44:41.020]  are the ones doing it. Keep going, you guys. We've got 16 plants. Each one of those gets special love.
[44:41.020 --> 44:48.220]  Yeah. You got 1600 plants. They all get noticed sometimes. Hopefully. Hopefully the emitter works
[44:48.220 --> 44:52.540]  in every plant. All right, Mike, I'm going to cut you off now because we're working our way past the
[44:52.540 --> 44:56.780]  45 minute mark. I don't want to make this too long. People's ADD will kick in. They do like it when we
[44:56.780 --> 45:01.660]  ramble. I think they got enough of that. Thank you so much for listening, everybody. I hope you
[45:01.660 --> 45:07.420]  enjoyed this update. If you did or if you didn't, reach out on social media. Yes. If you did like
[45:07.420 --> 45:11.980]  the video, click the thumbs up. If you did not like that video, click the thumbs down two times.
[45:11.980 --> 45:16.380]  That's how YouTube works. If you feel like this episode was educational, informative, or entertaining
[45:16.380 --> 45:19.580]  and you'd like to make a financial contribution to the show, all you have to do is visit
[45:19.580 --> 45:25.740]  www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. All of the information you need to support the show
[45:25.740 --> 45:29.980]  will be right there on the screen. I do encourage you also to support White Mike on Patreon.
[45:29.980 --> 45:36.060]  His is real easy to find. It's patreon.com forward slash white Mike. He did make a few updates to his
[45:36.060 --> 45:40.060]  Patreon, so I encourage you to check that out. Speaking of updates, I did some updates to the
[45:40.060 --> 45:43.900]  website. I'm opening up my phone to make sure I cover all of the notes. Yes, I did update the
[45:43.900 --> 45:48.540]  website. I've talked about the grow help tab. If you need some grow help, if you've got some grow
[45:48.540 --> 45:53.020]  questions, there's a tab that says grow help. Click on there. There are a few brief questions.
[45:53.020 --> 45:57.180]  I need that information before I even try to help you with your grow because I want to know the
[45:57.180 --> 46:00.860]  temperature, the humidity, what did you feed? All of that is going to make a big difference in my
[46:00.860 --> 46:05.180]  answers. Instead of you sending me one email and saying I've got a problem and then me asking you
[46:05.180 --> 46:09.980]  those questions, you've got to ask them before you can even get to the email. That helps me out a lot.
[46:09.980 --> 46:14.460]  Check out the website. There is also a spot where you can sign up for the newsletter. I mentioned
[46:14.460 --> 46:19.900]  this in the last episode about halfway down on the page. There's a spot where it says, what's on my
[46:19.900 --> 46:23.500]  hand? Oh, it's ashes from that bull. That freaked me out. I saw that on the cameras. Why is my hand
[46:23.500 --> 46:30.460]  all black? That was weird, dude. There's a spot. This woman was brought to you by cannabis. 420,
[46:30.460 --> 46:35.420]  420. Yeah, there's a spot on the website where you can sign up for the newsletter. If you sign up for
[46:35.420 --> 46:40.220]  that newsletter, it will work. A while back, I did ask for people to sign up for a mailing list
[46:40.220 --> 46:44.540]  and I failed at that. I couldn't make it work. This one works. It's been tested. It's official.
[46:44.540 --> 46:49.020]  Sign up for the newsletter. I'll keep you updated with all of the iRegenetics info you need, all the
[46:49.020 --> 46:54.620]  grow from your heart info. Everything Rasta Jeff is right there at iRegenetics.com. That was a lot
[46:54.620 --> 46:58.700]  of talking for that little bit of stuff. If you've got any questions, corrections, comments, or
[46:58.700 --> 47:04.380]  concerns, I encourage you to send me an email. My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[47:04.380 --> 47:10.300]  If you want to message Mike, you can find him on Twitter at atnemopunk15 or find him on Facebook
[47:10.300 --> 47:14.380]  at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws. Mike just took a rip off of a pipe that made him cough.
[47:14.380 --> 47:19.740]  I just got fried. I tried to cover for you there. You back on earth yet, bro? You doing all right?
[47:20.780 --> 47:26.540]  I have landed. That's a few places. I saw it. I watched it. I watched you fucking time travel,
[47:26.540 --> 47:32.460]  space travel. You changed colors. All right. Mike, do you got any wise words of wisdom as
[47:32.460 --> 47:36.860]  we wrap up this show or should I just say goodbye? Oh, do what I just did. That was amazing.
[47:36.860 --> 47:40.060]  All right, you guys take too big of a hit. Maybe don't do it on a podcast like I just did.
[47:40.060 --> 47:43.660]  Or do. It looked great. I might leave that right in the video. I might not even cut your half of
[47:43.660 --> 47:49.020]  the screen out for that. They make it to see that whole event there. That was fun. Yes. All right,
[47:49.020 --> 47:52.940]  dude. Thank you for hanging out. I want to thank the audience for hanging out. I'll be back in just
[47:52.940 --> 47:58.220]  a couple of days with fresh new content. I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy EZ057.
[47:58.220 --> 48:02.540]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
