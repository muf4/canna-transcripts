[00:01.150 --> 00:22.440]  All right, here we go.
[00:22.440 --> 00:24.080]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:24.080 --> 00:25.800]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:25.800 --> 00:30.160]  This is episode 790 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:30.160 --> 00:32.600]  In this episode, I'm going to give away a free pack of seeds.
[00:32.600 --> 00:33.600]  That's right.
[00:33.600 --> 00:38.040]  I've teamed up with our friends at seedsherenow.com to give away a free pack of Irie Genetics
[00:38.040 --> 00:39.040]  seeds.
[00:39.040 --> 00:41.360]  We'll talk more about that later in this episode.
[00:41.360 --> 00:45.880]  Before we go too far, I do want to announce that Irie Genetics will be at the Dude Grows
[00:45.880 --> 00:46.880]  Cup.
[00:46.880 --> 00:51.040]  That means that the Dude Grows Cup is happening again this year, June 3rd in Fort Collins,
[00:51.040 --> 00:52.040]  Colorado.
[00:52.040 --> 00:55.880]  Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all the information.
[00:55.880 --> 00:58.720]  I want to send another big shout out to our friends at Comedy Works.
[00:58.720 --> 00:59.720]  That's right.
[00:59.720 --> 01:01.440]  I was back at Comedy Works over the weekend.
[01:01.440 --> 01:03.160]  I got to see Ari Shafir.
[01:03.160 --> 01:04.160]  We saw Brian Simpson.
[01:04.160 --> 01:09.360]  Of course, the show was hosted and emceed and opened by none other than Sam Talent.
[01:09.360 --> 01:11.400]  All three of the performers were amazing.
[01:11.400 --> 01:15.200]  Everybody at Comedy Works treats Ms. Dreadvibes and myself like royalty.
[01:15.200 --> 01:16.760]  Big shout out to all of the comedians.
[01:16.840 --> 01:19.360]  Big shout out to all of the staff at Comedy Works.
[01:19.360 --> 01:22.520]  Of course, a big shout out to Ms. Dreadvibes.
[01:22.520 --> 01:23.640]  Comedy Works doesn't pay me to say that.
[01:23.640 --> 01:27.000]  I just have so much fun going there that I do need to give them a shout out.
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.000]  I know that some of the crew listens to the podcast.
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.080]  Big fist bump, big love to the whole crew at Comedy Works.
[01:33.080 --> 01:34.080]  All right.
[01:34.080 --> 01:38.120]  Now, let's segue into the email and grow question portion of this episode.
[01:38.120 --> 01:42.920]  In the last episode, I said that if you sent me a grow question on the grow help tab on
[01:42.920 --> 01:47.400]  my website, I said if I read that question here on the podcast, you would win a free
[01:47.400 --> 01:48.400]  pack of seeds.
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.040]  I want to give a big shout out to my new friend, Stuart, for sending me a great grow question.
[01:53.040 --> 01:54.960]  Also, congratulations, Stuart.
[01:54.960 --> 01:59.280]  I would like to send you a free pack of seeds because I'm going to read your question here
[01:59.280 --> 02:00.840]  on the podcast.
[02:00.840 --> 02:01.840]  Big shout out to Stuart.
[02:01.840 --> 02:06.360]  Also, big shout out to seedsherenow.com for sponsoring the seed giveaway.
[02:06.360 --> 02:10.680]  Stuart has won a free pack of iRegenetics beans to go along with his already packed
[02:10.680 --> 02:12.520]  garden of iRegenetics seeds.
[02:13.120 --> 02:14.120]  All right.
[02:14.120 --> 02:15.120]  Let's jump into the grow question.
[02:15.120 --> 02:18.280]  This one came from the grow help tab on the iRegenetics.com website.
[02:18.280 --> 02:20.000]  You go to iRegenetics.com.
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.440]  On the top right, there's a part that says questions.
[02:22.440 --> 02:23.680]  Click right on that tab.
[02:23.680 --> 02:26.080]  It will bring down a list of questions that I want to ask.
[02:26.080 --> 02:28.700]  It basically says, what kind of question do you have?
[02:28.700 --> 02:30.120]  What strain are you growing?
[02:30.120 --> 02:31.120]  Where are you growing it?
[02:31.120 --> 02:32.120]  What type of lighting?
[02:32.120 --> 02:33.680]  I ask a few basic questions.
[02:33.680 --> 02:36.600]  That way, I can answer your question with more detail.
[02:36.600 --> 02:38.480]  So go to iRegenetics.com.
[02:38.480 --> 02:40.000]  There's a bunch of tabs on the top.
[02:40.000 --> 02:41.220]  There's one that says questions.
[02:41.220 --> 02:42.220]  Click right over there.
[02:42.220 --> 02:43.380]  It will bring up this form.
[02:43.380 --> 02:44.380]  Fill this out.
[02:44.380 --> 02:48.460]  If I read that question on the podcast, you will also win a free pack of seeds.
[02:48.460 --> 02:51.460]  Of course, this giveaway does expire at some time.
[02:51.460 --> 02:53.020]  Whenever I decide, I haven't determined that.
[02:53.020 --> 02:55.420]  Whenever the sponsorship and the deal ends, it ends.
[02:55.420 --> 02:57.180]  But for now, send me your grow questions.
[02:57.180 --> 02:58.580]  You may win some free seeds.
[02:58.580 --> 03:00.380]  Congrats to our friend, Stuart.
[03:00.380 --> 03:01.380]  Stuart's question.
[03:01.380 --> 03:02.380]  Let's get to it finally.
[03:02.380 --> 03:03.420]  It goes a little bit like this.
[03:03.420 --> 03:05.720]  It says, what strains are you growing?
[03:05.720 --> 03:07.380]  Stuart is growing a nice buffet of strains.
[03:07.380 --> 03:12.660]  It looks like we've got Cherry Garcia, Early Berry, Grandpa's Cookies, Spice and Strawberry
[03:12.660 --> 03:15.140]  Banana, More That He Can't Remember.
[03:15.140 --> 03:16.500]  He's got some Nuketown in there.
[03:16.500 --> 03:22.260]  Heavy Duty Fruity to Afterglow Testers, The Prize, Scarlet Begonias, Lady Marmalade, and
[03:22.260 --> 03:24.660]  he said, All By The Man, The Myth, The Legend, Rasta Jeff.
[03:24.660 --> 03:25.660]  Well, thank you, brother.
[03:25.660 --> 03:26.660]  I appreciate that.
[03:26.660 --> 03:28.900]  You're growing a nice buffet of great genetics in there.
[03:28.900 --> 03:30.460]  It says, where are you growing these?
[03:30.460 --> 03:34.420]  These are being grown indoors under LED lighting.
[03:34.420 --> 03:36.500]  There's a lot of questions here that don't really pertain.
[03:36.620 --> 03:37.620]  I've already read the question.
[03:37.620 --> 03:38.980]  A lot of these details don't pertain.
[03:38.980 --> 03:40.460]  So I'm going to skip some of this.
[03:40.460 --> 03:43.860]  We're going to get right to the technical part of this question.
[03:43.860 --> 03:47.780]  It says, Rasta Jeff, let me start out by saying I'm a big fan of the show.
[03:47.780 --> 03:49.700]  I've been listening since right before the vid.
[03:49.700 --> 03:50.700]  Bro, thank you for jumping on.
[03:50.700 --> 03:54.180]  I got a lot of new listeners and subscribers right around the vid time.
[03:54.180 --> 03:57.620]  By the way, if you haven't already subscribed, do hit that subscribe button, everybody out
[03:57.620 --> 03:58.620]  there.
[03:58.620 --> 03:59.780]  There's a lot more to this, but then it goes on.
[03:59.780 --> 04:01.860]  It says, I'm a big fan of your gear.
[04:01.860 --> 04:05.020]  Ran a few strains and already I have more in the dirt.
[04:05.020 --> 04:10.740]  It says, my problem is that my overall dried and trimmed weight is not to my satisfaction.
[04:10.740 --> 04:15.180]  So he's grown a bunch of great genetics, but the overall finished product doesn't weigh
[04:15.180 --> 04:16.180]  enough.
[04:16.180 --> 04:18.540]  We're not getting enough finished product here at the end.
[04:18.540 --> 04:19.780]  We do have more details here.
[04:19.780 --> 04:20.780]  The message goes on.
[04:20.780 --> 04:27.740]  It says, in veg, I have a 600 B-spec and a 150 R-spec covering about 40 seedlings and
[04:27.740 --> 04:30.180]  30 veg in three gallon homes.
[04:30.180 --> 04:37.220]  In one of the flower rooms, I have 48 three gallon plants under two 600 R-specs and one
[04:37.220 --> 04:40.300]  350 R-spec Diablo, which are all HLG.
[04:40.300 --> 04:42.900]  Those are good lights, but that's a lot of plants, bro.
[04:42.900 --> 04:45.600]  And the other flower room, okay, then he describes the other room.
[04:45.600 --> 04:48.980]  He says, I'm using new millennium nutrients that should work well for you at the recommended
[04:48.980 --> 04:54.540]  dosage along with HNG root accelerator and Epsom salt at a low dosage.
[04:54.540 --> 04:56.860]  He goes on and says, I don't test my PPM.
[04:56.860 --> 05:01.660]  I also just put four weeks, but I have everything from seedlings to plants to week nine of flower
[05:01.660 --> 05:02.660]  and everything between.
[05:02.660 --> 05:05.060]  He says, I am supplementing CO2.
[05:05.060 --> 05:10.100]  And he says, anyway, I never did a true pheno hunt and my plants dried in trim weight goes
[05:10.100 --> 05:12.820]  from 16 grams of plant to 38 grams of plant.
[05:12.820 --> 05:14.300]  I've seen, there are a lot of plants in this room.
[05:14.300 --> 05:15.300]  I've seen pictures.
[05:15.300 --> 05:16.300]  There are a lot in there.
[05:16.300 --> 05:20.020]  He says, my overall yield is less than a pound and a half.
[05:20.020 --> 05:22.220]  I have lost track with the plants.
[05:22.220 --> 05:25.700]  So he says, I've lost track with the plants that are in veg.
[05:25.700 --> 05:27.020]  And they flower, I can tell.
[05:27.020 --> 05:31.220]  Anyway, should I start tracking in veg when I clone and the next harvest?
[05:31.220 --> 05:33.660]  This is kind of worded a little bit oddly and I'm reading it very quickly.
[05:33.660 --> 05:36.220]  He says, I need weight to cover the cost and so forth.
[05:36.220 --> 05:40.340]  Or is there something I'm missing or messing up or any other suggestions?
[05:40.340 --> 05:42.340]  Please feel free to read this for a show.
[05:42.340 --> 05:43.340]  I also worked.
[05:43.340 --> 05:46.540]  OK, so there's a lot of details that I'm going to skip in here in this question.
[05:46.540 --> 05:51.300]  But there's also a lot of stuff that I can explain very quickly just from the little
[05:51.300 --> 05:52.480]  bit that I read.
[05:52.480 --> 05:55.000]  My friend sent a lot of pictures here of this grow.
[05:55.000 --> 05:59.240]  The first thing that I noticed is that there are, in my opinion, I'm not sure if you're
[05:59.240 --> 06:04.760]  going to disagree, but in my opinion, there are just too many damn plants in this room.
[06:04.760 --> 06:08.040]  You're trying, you're kind of with all due respect, and I understand this because I'm
[06:08.040 --> 06:09.080]  guilty as well.
[06:09.080 --> 06:10.800]  You're being a plant hoarder.
[06:10.800 --> 06:13.400]  You've got too many different strains in there, in my opinion.
[06:13.400 --> 06:14.680]  You got too many different plants.
[06:14.680 --> 06:18.720]  And really, from reading what you're telling me in this one paragraph, you don't have a
[06:18.720 --> 06:19.720]  strategy.
[06:19.720 --> 06:23.840]  So if you don't have a strategy, if you don't have a roadmap, it's hard to get to the destination.
[06:23.840 --> 06:25.360]  It's hard to get to the goal.
[06:25.360 --> 06:29.800]  So the first thing I would do, I would minimize some of those plants in every room.
[06:29.800 --> 06:31.160]  There are too many plants in every room.
[06:31.160 --> 06:32.840]  I got a lot of photos.
[06:32.840 --> 06:35.480]  Every room, the plants are way too close together.
[06:35.480 --> 06:39.200]  That's why they look so tall and stretchy, and they're kind of, there's not a lot of
[06:39.200 --> 06:41.440]  growth at the bottom part, and they've really stretched out.
[06:41.440 --> 06:44.600]  And I know that you've cleaned up the bottoms in a lot of those photos, but they wouldn't
[06:44.600 --> 06:47.040]  be so tall and stretchy if you spread them out a little bit.
[06:47.040 --> 06:48.540]  They're too close together.
[06:48.540 --> 06:52.840]  And instead of getting tight nodes and developing the way they should, they're stretching to
[06:52.840 --> 06:56.040]  get up to the light, because there's just so many of them crowded together.
[06:56.040 --> 06:58.560]  Instead of being able to reach out and go, oh yeah, I'm living the dream.
[06:58.560 --> 07:00.640]  They're going, hey, is there some fucking light up there?
[07:00.640 --> 07:03.360]  And they're just trying to reach up as hard as they can, because they're frustrated with
[07:03.360 --> 07:04.360]  life.
[07:04.360 --> 07:05.720]  That's what it looks like to me from the photos.
[07:05.720 --> 07:08.360]  And that's simply because you're just packing too many in there.
[07:08.360 --> 07:10.520]  And I know it sounds like a numbers game.
[07:10.520 --> 07:13.460]  You would think the more plants in there, the more product I'm going to produce.
[07:13.460 --> 07:16.880]  But there is a point of diminishing returns, and you've hit that point, my friend.
[07:16.880 --> 07:21.000]  I would remove at least one row along the outside, one row along the outside, and the
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.240]  whole square you've got, and just use all that space to spread them out that much more.
[07:25.240 --> 07:27.880]  I would minimize a lot of plants in that room, to be honest with you.
[07:27.880 --> 07:31.760]  So there are too many plants that are stretching, and they're competing for space, because the
[07:31.760 --> 07:33.600]  lower leaves are not getting any light.
[07:33.600 --> 07:35.640]  That's why you've had to clean up all the bottoms.
[07:35.640 --> 07:36.640]  And that's going to keep happening.
[07:36.640 --> 07:41.040]  As tall as they get, the more tall, the taller they grow, they're just going to keep shading
[07:41.040 --> 07:42.040]  each other out.
[07:42.040 --> 07:44.380]  And they're just going to keep stretching more to get taller and taller.
[07:44.380 --> 07:47.600]  And tall plants are great, but you want plants that fill in and produce a lot.
[07:47.600 --> 07:49.280]  And they don't have that option.
[07:49.280 --> 07:51.800]  So you're not setting yourself up for success from the beginning.
[07:51.800 --> 07:54.280]  At the veg stage, you're already getting behind.
[07:54.280 --> 07:55.760]  The plants are already getting stretchy.
[07:55.760 --> 07:59.640]  You need a good foundation, a good structure to have a good weight-producing plant.
[07:59.640 --> 08:03.960]  So first thing I would do, I keep saying this, too many damn plants in all of those rooms, bro.
[08:03.960 --> 08:05.920]  I know you've got a lot of plants in there.
[08:05.920 --> 08:06.920]  You're just like me.
[08:06.920 --> 08:07.920]  I'm a seed hoarder.
[08:07.920 --> 08:08.920]  I'm a plant hoarder.
[08:08.920 --> 08:12.040]  I try to grow as many as will fit in the damn room that I am legally allowed, but I stuff
[08:12.040 --> 08:14.400]  the room, dude.
[08:14.400 --> 08:16.960]  So I get it, but you've got to get rid of some of those plants.
[08:16.960 --> 08:18.380]  Also they're too close together.
[08:18.500 --> 08:19.500]  You've got to spread them out.
[08:19.500 --> 08:22.300]  Also, one thing I noticed in your pictures, there are no fans.
[08:22.300 --> 08:26.540]  There's no air movement in any of those rooms, which is also why the plants are getting tall
[08:26.540 --> 08:27.740]  and stretchy and spindly.
[08:27.740 --> 08:31.740]  If you put some air in there, some air movement, blow the plants around, they'll get a little
[08:31.740 --> 08:32.740]  stronger.
[08:32.740 --> 08:33.740]  They won't be so thin and wispy.
[08:33.740 --> 08:35.300]  They'll get a little bit thicker.
[08:35.300 --> 08:39.900]  That will produce bigger, fatter buds, a better harvest, a better yield in the long run.
[08:39.900 --> 08:42.860]  Also, they're not popped and twisted.
[08:42.860 --> 08:43.860]  Nothing's really done to them.
[08:43.860 --> 08:47.260]  They're topped one time, it looks like they spread out, and then you defoliate and clean
[08:47.260 --> 08:50.940]  up the bottom, shave the legs a little bit, but there's no popping and twisting done.
[08:50.940 --> 08:55.540]  If you spread them out a little bit, top them, pop them and twist them, and put some fans
[08:55.540 --> 08:59.580]  on them, that's going to give you bigger, beefier, stockier, more robust plants.
[08:59.580 --> 09:01.800]  You'll be able to veg for a little bit less time.
[09:01.800 --> 09:04.980]  You'll still get big fat plants, and you won't need as many in the room.
[09:04.980 --> 09:09.260]  So work a little bit on the popping and twisting.
[09:09.260 --> 09:12.740]  I saw that the one room in veg was heavily defoliated.
[09:12.740 --> 09:15.920]  I probably wouldn't defoliate that much in veg.
[09:15.920 --> 09:16.920]  That is where you're getting the energy.
[09:16.920 --> 09:22.360]  I would wait a little bit more until the flowering phase, early flower, mid flower, to do that
[09:22.360 --> 09:23.800]  heavy defoliation that you're doing.
[09:23.800 --> 09:28.040]  You can still pull leaves, but you're going kind of hard in the beginning, in my opinion,
[09:28.040 --> 09:29.040]  based on the photos.
[09:29.040 --> 09:30.640]  So you've got too many plants in there.
[09:30.640 --> 09:31.640]  They're too close together.
[09:31.640 --> 09:32.640]  There are no fans.
[09:32.640 --> 09:36.440]  I'd spread those bitches apart, get some wind on them, pop them and twist them.
[09:36.440 --> 09:40.320]  I'm sure you've heard the episode about popping and twisting where you just ... I'll show
[09:40.320 --> 09:42.400]  you kind of with this microphone a little bit.
[09:42.400 --> 09:45.080]  If this were the main stock of the plant, I would start at the bottom, right where it
[09:45.240 --> 09:46.240]  comes out of the dirt.
[09:46.240 --> 09:47.240]  I would grab it.
[09:47.240 --> 09:51.720]  Remember in school when we tried to pick who goes first at baseball, who bats first?
[09:51.720 --> 09:54.040]  You grab it down here and then you put the other hand up here and the other guy goes
[09:54.040 --> 09:55.560]  like this and like this.
[09:55.560 --> 09:59.280]  Every time you do that, just twist opposite directions and pop the cellulose structure
[09:59.280 --> 10:00.280]  of that plant.
[10:00.280 --> 10:01.280]  It'll sound like this.
[10:01.280 --> 10:03.160]  I don't know if that worked.
[10:03.160 --> 10:04.160]  It'll sound like that.
[10:04.160 --> 10:05.700]  It'll sound just like I'm popping a knuckle.
[10:05.700 --> 10:08.140]  That's what we call it on the plants, pop the knuckles.
[10:08.140 --> 10:10.760]  What happens is that will slow down that vertical growth.
[10:10.760 --> 10:11.760]  Vertical, right?
[10:11.760 --> 10:13.120]  Yeah, slow down the vertical growth of the plant.
[10:13.160 --> 10:17.000]  It'll also make the branch get a little bit more robust and a little bit sturdier.
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.680]  That more robust, sturdier, thicker plant is going to produce bigger, fatter, juicier
[10:20.680 --> 10:23.840]  buds so it's going to make your stocks a little stronger.
[10:23.840 --> 10:26.280]  That's one thing that I would definitely recommend.
[10:26.280 --> 10:29.800]  Less defoliation and more fans is how I would start.
[10:29.800 --> 10:33.960]  Then something I want to talk about is you said that you're using the New Millennium
[10:33.960 --> 10:35.800]  nutrients with a couple of additives.
[10:35.800 --> 10:37.600]  Are you using any bloom boosters?
[10:37.600 --> 10:42.440]  In my opinion, the New Millennium is great but I like to add something for a bloom booster.
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.360]  If you want to use something that is very affordable and very effective, in my opinion,
[10:46.360 --> 10:50.360]  I think that Budswell works very well with the New Millennium mix.
[10:50.360 --> 10:52.160]  Add some Budswell in there.
[10:52.160 --> 10:53.920]  Add that around week five, week six.
[10:53.920 --> 10:56.480]  Also, I really like a product called Shine.
[10:56.480 --> 10:58.280]  I talk a lot about Shine.
[10:58.280 --> 11:01.360]  If I'm growing smokeable flower, a lot of what I grow is for seed.
[11:01.360 --> 11:04.600]  If I'm growing smokeable flower, I put a lot of Shine in the mix.
[11:04.600 --> 11:06.240]  I really think that puts bulk in there.
[11:06.240 --> 11:10.760]  It puts weight to the product and it puts a lot of trichomes and a lot of funk to your
[11:10.760 --> 11:11.760]  product.
[11:11.760 --> 11:15.760]  So, I think Budswell and some Shine and then a kelp product with that.
[11:15.760 --> 11:18.120]  Then also, don't forget about the Ruby.
[11:18.120 --> 11:21.920]  New Millennium doesn't sponsor me or pay me but I think Ruby is a great product.
[11:21.920 --> 11:23.120]  It's fulvic acid.
[11:23.120 --> 11:25.840]  Use that five milliliters per gallon with every feed.
[11:25.840 --> 11:27.400]  I think that will make your feed more effective.
[11:27.400 --> 11:28.800]  So, a bloom booster.
[11:28.800 --> 11:31.060]  Do you have some sort of a bloom booster in there?
[11:31.060 --> 11:33.720]  Something to push it, something to make it go shebang.
[11:33.720 --> 11:35.440]  You've got all the gas in there.
[11:35.440 --> 11:37.320]  Do you have anything to make it turbo charge?
[11:37.320 --> 11:38.520]  We got to turbo charge this shit.
[11:38.520 --> 11:41.520]  If you're not getting enough, we got to turbo charge it.
[11:41.560 --> 11:43.920]  The flower that you posted a picture of looks good.
[11:43.920 --> 11:48.320]  You posted some very beautiful, very colorful flower that looks really good.
[11:48.320 --> 11:49.320]  It looked healthy.
[11:49.320 --> 11:50.320]  It looked happy.
[11:50.320 --> 11:52.680]  So, I'm thinking we may need just to boost these up a little bit.
[11:52.680 --> 11:54.120]  The topping looks good.
[11:54.120 --> 11:58.680]  I would work on some sort of scrogging or some sort of trellis system or maybe some
[11:58.680 --> 11:59.680]  sort of supports.
[11:59.680 --> 12:02.080]  I would have less plants in there and I would spread them out.
[12:02.080 --> 12:04.040]  That would make the plants get bigger.
[12:04.040 --> 12:07.120]  They would get beefy fat buds which are going to need supports.
[12:07.520 --> 12:11.840]  So, I would work on some sort of a scrog net or some sort of trellis or maybe tomato cages
[12:11.840 --> 12:13.400]  or maybe just a bunch of sticks in there.
[12:13.400 --> 12:15.200]  If you do that, be very careful.
[12:15.200 --> 12:17.000]  But I would recommend something to support them.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.560]  That way they don't have to spend all of their energy holding themselves up and they can
[12:20.560 --> 12:23.400]  use more energy producing flowers.
[12:23.400 --> 12:25.800]  Also, strain selection.
[12:25.800 --> 12:27.800]  You said that you haven't done any pheno hunts.
[12:27.800 --> 12:32.120]  I think strain selection is going to be a big deal for you.
[12:32.120 --> 12:33.200]  It's going to make a big difference.
[12:33.200 --> 12:36.920]  If you've got plants in there that are not putting the weight you need, definitely remove
[12:36.920 --> 12:37.920]  those plants.
[12:37.920 --> 12:41.520]  If you've got plants in there that bang out the weight you need, put more of those plants
[12:41.520 --> 12:42.520]  in the room.
[12:42.520 --> 12:43.560]  That's kind of a no-brainer there.
[12:43.560 --> 12:45.080]  But that comes from a good pheno hunt.
[12:45.080 --> 12:46.160]  That comes from running shit.
[12:46.160 --> 12:50.960]  That also comes from not getting too attached to those plants that are not performing well.
[12:50.960 --> 12:51.960]  They may be your friends.
[12:51.960 --> 12:52.960]  They may be green.
[12:52.960 --> 12:53.960]  They may be beautiful.
[12:53.960 --> 12:56.040]  But sometimes we've got to cull those plants.
[12:56.040 --> 12:57.040]  Don't be afraid.
[12:57.040 --> 12:59.960]  If you're trying to hit numbers and pay the bills, you can't get too attached to things.
[12:59.960 --> 13:02.320]  You've got to remember that you've got to pay the bills.
[13:02.320 --> 13:06.200]  Get rid of those low yielding, low quality plants that do not produce, that don't reach
[13:06.200 --> 13:07.200]  your goal.
[13:07.200 --> 13:08.760]  Set yourself up for success, bro.
[13:08.760 --> 13:10.520]  So strain selection.
[13:10.520 --> 13:11.840]  Less strains in there also.
[13:11.840 --> 13:13.320]  Less strains overall.
[13:13.320 --> 13:18.600]  And then I would dial it down to like maybe two, maybe three strains per flower room.
[13:18.600 --> 13:20.320]  That way you can learn the strains.
[13:20.320 --> 13:23.560]  If you've got too many plants in that room, how are you going to know that this plant
[13:23.560 --> 13:27.600]  likes a little bit more nitrogen and this plant doesn't like so much cow mag and this
[13:27.600 --> 13:29.520]  plant would like it a little bit cooler?
[13:29.520 --> 13:32.620]  You'll never find that out because you've got to run that baseline room all the time
[13:32.620 --> 13:34.680]  with no adjustments, no changes.
[13:34.680 --> 13:38.600]  So I would eliminate it to your few favorite plants and then really build a relationship
[13:38.600 --> 13:42.880]  and dial it in with a few cultivars in that room that can definitely max out and reach
[13:42.880 --> 13:45.160]  the potential and reach the goals which you need to reach.
[13:45.160 --> 13:47.760]  You've got too many, you're dating too many ladies in there.
[13:47.760 --> 13:50.920]  You're never going to learn one of them to make one of them fully satisfied.
[13:50.920 --> 13:53.440]  You're going to be juggling to keep all those ladies happy.
[13:53.440 --> 13:57.560]  You just got to focus on one and make that one lady super happy and you will both win
[13:57.560 --> 13:58.560]  together.
[13:58.560 --> 14:03.360]  So one of my pieces of advice is to just minimize the amount of plants and the variety in there
[14:03.360 --> 14:04.360]  and dial it in.
[14:05.040 --> 14:09.640]  Build a relationship with a cut, learn that cut and maximize the shit out of that.
[14:09.640 --> 14:10.640]  CO2 may help.
[14:10.640 --> 14:11.720]  You said you have CO2 in the room.
[14:11.720 --> 14:14.960]  I don't know how much CO2 you're using but bang that shit out bro.
[14:14.960 --> 14:17.400]  Turn it up, get more of that.
[14:17.400 --> 14:20.600]  Then here's something that I really think will help you a lot.
[14:20.600 --> 14:25.000]  I think that a little bit of a strategy, a little bit of a plan, a little bit of a schedule,
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.800]  a little bit of a goal, a little bit of a standard operating procedure would really
[14:28.800 --> 14:29.800]  help you out.
[14:29.800 --> 14:33.120]  It kind of sounds like you're growing, you're making flowers, you're making product but
[14:33.120 --> 14:34.840]  you're doing it kind of willy nilly.
[14:34.840 --> 14:39.800]  I would write down when I pick these clones, I'm going to veg them.
[14:39.800 --> 14:41.560]  They're going to be in the clone stage for two weeks.
[14:41.560 --> 14:46.120]  I'll put them into small pots for three weeks, into bigger pots, let them veg for four weeks
[14:46.120 --> 14:47.120]  after that.
[14:47.120 --> 14:48.720]  Then we flower them for nine weeks.
[14:48.720 --> 14:52.720]  Set a timeline, decide how tall into veg you're going to let those plants get.
[14:52.720 --> 14:54.280]  Start setting some goals.
[14:54.280 --> 14:59.120]  Then definitely start writing down when you cut the clone, when you put it into veg, when
[14:59.120 --> 15:01.160]  you put it into flower.
[15:01.160 --> 15:04.760]  Start writing down what you feed, how often you feed it.
[15:04.760 --> 15:09.360]  Create repeatable results by creating a standard operating procedure and by keeping notes.
[15:09.360 --> 15:11.840]  Then keep the notes of what you did.
[15:11.840 --> 15:15.800]  See what came out good, see what came out bad and then repeat what was good.
[15:15.800 --> 15:17.320]  Don't do what was bad.
[15:17.320 --> 15:19.640]  It looks like you've got the right idea as a grower.
[15:19.640 --> 15:23.360]  It definitely looks like you know how to take care of plants, how to transplant things,
[15:23.360 --> 15:24.360]  how to build a room.
[15:24.360 --> 15:28.880]  It looks like you have a good understanding but I think you need just a little bit of
[15:28.880 --> 15:32.560]  like a drill sergeant in there just saying, what did you do in here soldier?
[15:32.560 --> 15:33.840]  Write this shit down soldier.
[15:33.840 --> 15:35.360]  Get on a schedule soldier.
[15:35.360 --> 15:36.360]  Clean this shit up.
[15:36.360 --> 15:37.360]  Get rid of these plants.
[15:37.360 --> 15:38.560]  You just need that person over your shoulder.
[15:38.560 --> 15:39.560]  Make that person you.
[15:39.560 --> 15:43.560]  You're the only one in there so you've got to be accountable for that sort of stuff.
[15:43.560 --> 15:44.560]  Get on a schedule.
[15:44.560 --> 15:47.080]  I keep saying this but I'm really OCD about it.
[15:47.080 --> 15:49.360]  I know I've got clones in a cloner right now.
[15:49.360 --> 15:50.880]  I've got small pots somewhere right now.
[15:50.880 --> 15:52.720]  I've got bigger pots somewhere right now.
[15:52.720 --> 15:54.600]  I've got a pollinated room right now.
[15:54.600 --> 15:58.800]  If I open up my notebook in those rooms, I know when each thing happened in that room.
[15:58.840 --> 16:01.160]  I know what the last feed was in each of those rooms.
[16:01.160 --> 16:02.400]  I know what's going on.
[16:02.400 --> 16:04.960]  I know when the harvests are going to happen.
[16:04.960 --> 16:09.680]  Knowing when the next harvest is going to happen allows me to know when to cut clones
[16:09.680 --> 16:14.360]  for the harvest two cuts behind that because I've got the harvest coming.
[16:14.360 --> 16:18.520]  I've got veg plants going and as soon as the harvest comes down, the veg plants go into
[16:18.520 --> 16:19.520]  flower.
[16:19.520 --> 16:24.000]  I've got to get cuts so that I've got those veg plants ready to go once again.
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.080]  So I've got a good tight schedule written down.
[16:26.080 --> 16:28.040]  I know exactly when that shit needs to happen.
[16:28.040 --> 16:32.760]  It's basically when these clones go into these pots, these cups go into these pots
[16:32.760 --> 16:35.960]  and they're going to veg but then the first, the old pots that were in there go in because
[16:35.960 --> 16:37.600]  I do it in two stages.
[16:37.600 --> 16:38.600]  You'll learn your rhythm.
[16:38.600 --> 16:41.520]  So eventually you'll be able to create a perpetual cycle.
[16:41.520 --> 16:42.880]  You've got two rooms.
[16:42.880 --> 16:46.960]  You should have mother plants, clones, small veg and then you should have veg lined up
[16:46.960 --> 16:51.160]  to go into each flower room or at least veg in that room for a couple of weeks.
[16:51.160 --> 16:54.700]  You'll be able to create a great rhythm if you just plan a strategy and know these plants
[16:54.700 --> 16:56.060]  flower for nine weeks.
[16:56.060 --> 17:00.700]  That means that every nine weeks I need to have more plants ready to go into this room,
[17:00.700 --> 17:03.660]  figure out how long to veg, when to cut the plants.
[17:03.660 --> 17:05.280]  That's a two week clone cycle.
[17:05.280 --> 17:06.900]  You got seven more weeks to go.
[17:06.900 --> 17:09.460]  You got three weeks in a small pot, four weeks in a big pot.
[17:09.460 --> 17:13.900]  Then you go into flower, repeat that process, dial it in, learn the plants, learn the process,
[17:13.900 --> 17:14.900]  learn the rhythm.
[17:14.900 --> 17:17.180]  You will start banging out the weight that you need.
[17:17.180 --> 17:22.940]  So my friend, the overall diagnosis, the prognosis, my assumption in there is I think you're just
[17:22.940 --> 17:25.100]  packing way too many plants in that room.
[17:25.140 --> 17:30.020]  Like I said, it sounds like more plants equals more weight, but it doesn't always equal more
[17:30.020 --> 17:31.020]  weight.
[17:31.020 --> 17:33.660]  It equals more fluffy bud because all of the plants are competing for that light that's
[17:33.660 --> 17:34.660]  in the room.
[17:34.660 --> 17:36.420]  It's like trying to feed a bunch of people.
[17:36.420 --> 17:39.780]  You could feed a hundred people the same amount of food every day and you're going to have
[17:39.780 --> 17:41.380]  a bunch of skinny people walking around.
[17:41.380 --> 17:44.700]  If you cut it down to 70 people, those people get that much more food.
[17:44.700 --> 17:45.940]  They're going to get a little bit thicker.
[17:45.940 --> 17:49.060]  Unfortunately, we can't just go cut out people, but just see what I'm saying.
[17:49.060 --> 17:52.380]  If you cut it down to 50% of the people, they get fed twice as much.
[17:52.380 --> 17:55.820]  They'll be able to thrive, get bigger, build some muscle, kick some ass.
[17:55.820 --> 17:58.540]  That's kind of what I'm recommending happens in this grow.
[17:58.540 --> 18:00.680]  Also take those fucking notes.
[18:00.680 --> 18:04.380]  Definitely get a schedule, take some notes and get some strategy going, bro.
[18:04.380 --> 18:05.980]  Get a notebook, get a calendar.
[18:05.980 --> 18:07.580]  We've all got Google devices.
[18:07.580 --> 18:09.220]  There are apps that'll take notes for you.
[18:09.220 --> 18:11.780]  If you need some help and want some guidance on that, please do reach out.
[18:11.780 --> 18:12.780]  I'd be more than happy.
[18:12.780 --> 18:16.780]  Maybe I could do a full episode on how to set up some schedules and take some notes
[18:16.780 --> 18:22.540]  and then also add those bloom boosters, that bud swell, the shine, some kelp products,
[18:22.540 --> 18:25.260]  and definitely use that fulvic acid if you are not.
[18:25.260 --> 18:27.460]  All right, my dude, I rambled on quite a while.
[18:27.460 --> 18:28.460]  How long have we been going?
[18:28.460 --> 18:30.420]  I think I rambled on long enough about that one.
[18:30.420 --> 18:31.900]  Stewart, thank you for the great question.
[18:31.900 --> 18:34.500]  I do look forward to sending you a free pack of seeds.
[18:34.500 --> 18:37.740]  Make sure the next email you send me has got your address.
[18:37.740 --> 18:40.820]  If you've got any requests for seeds, please do make your request.
[18:40.820 --> 18:43.340]  If I've got what you request, I will kindly send it.
[18:43.340 --> 18:45.620]  If I don't have it, you're going to get some surprises.
[18:45.620 --> 18:46.620]  Don't be disappointed.
[18:46.660 --> 18:51.300]  And just to burst your bubble right now, there are no orange chasm seeds available for these
[18:51.300 --> 18:52.300]  freebies.
[18:52.300 --> 18:53.300]  Those are gone.
[18:53.300 --> 18:56.220]  All right, podcast world, that is enough podcasting for me today.
[18:56.220 --> 18:59.940]  If you did not win the free seeds on today's episode, have no fear because there will be
[18:59.940 --> 19:03.020]  plenty more opportunities to win free seeds.
[19:03.020 --> 19:04.580]  It is very easy to win free seeds.
[19:04.580 --> 19:08.540]  All you have to do is go to my website, iRegenetics.com.
[19:08.540 --> 19:10.220]  On the top, there's a bunch of tabs.
[19:10.220 --> 19:11.980]  There's one that says questions.
[19:11.980 --> 19:13.220]  Click on that tab.
[19:13.220 --> 19:15.100]  Send me a good grow question.
[19:15.100 --> 19:20.620]  If I read your grow question here on the podcast, I will send you a free pack of iRegenetics
[19:20.620 --> 19:21.620]  seeds.
[19:21.620 --> 19:25.500]  Of course, that giveaway is sponsored by our friends at seedsherenow.com.
[19:25.500 --> 19:30.460]  Big shout out to seedsherenow.com for sponsoring a free seed giveaway.
[19:30.460 --> 19:33.740]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, you know I'd love to hear from
[19:33.740 --> 19:34.740]  you.
[19:34.740 --> 19:37.100]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[19:37.100 --> 19:38.100]  Don't be shy.
[19:38.100 --> 19:39.100]  Send me those questions.
[19:39.100 --> 19:42.060]  Send me that constructive criticism, that positive feedback.
[19:42.060 --> 19:43.860]  Even if you've got hate mail, don't be shy.
[19:43.860 --> 19:44.980]  I'll still read it.
[19:45.020 --> 19:46.980]  Let me know what you think of the podcast.
[19:46.980 --> 19:52.240]  Make sure you support the show on Patreon at patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[19:52.240 --> 19:56.140]  Anything else you might need is on my website, of course, iRegenetics.com.
[19:56.140 --> 19:57.540]  There's that grow help tab.
[19:57.540 --> 19:59.040]  There's a link to the Discord.
[19:59.040 --> 20:00.800]  There's a link to iRedirect.
[20:00.800 --> 20:04.580]  Anything you could imagine is on iRegenetics.com.
[20:04.580 --> 20:07.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's all I've got for you for this episode.
[20:07.080 --> 20:09.060]  You know I'll be back in another week with fresh new content.
[20:09.060 --> 20:13.020]  I want to give a big shout out to our friend, Lawrence Eugene Dunn.
[20:13.020 --> 20:16.260]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
