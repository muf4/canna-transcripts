[00:03.840 --> 00:34.330]  Welcome to the show podcast world, it's time for episode 404 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:34.330 --> 00:35.670]  podcast.
[00:35.670 --> 00:39.830]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:39.830 --> 00:44.270]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[00:44.270 --> 00:50.270]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:50.270 --> 00:54.110]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[00:54.110 --> 00:58.510]  I am still dabbing this pineapple Fanta live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[00:58.510 --> 01:03.350]  Once again, the label says it is a combination of golden pineapple and jet fuel gelato.
[01:03.350 --> 01:07.750]  The flavor on the label is described as citrus cleaner, haze and fruit chews.
[01:07.750 --> 01:10.310]  I think it tastes just like a pineapple Fanta.
[01:10.310 --> 01:14.630]  I think the flavor and aroma even include the fizzy part of the Fanta drink.
[01:14.630 --> 01:16.790]  I think it's delicious and amazing.
[01:16.790 --> 01:22.310]  On the back of the product container, it says it contains 59.81% THC.
[01:22.310 --> 01:28.710]  I really enjoy the pineapple Fanta live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[01:28.710 --> 01:32.910]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode is going to be another compilation of reposted grow
[01:32.910 --> 01:33.910]  lessons.
[01:33.910 --> 01:43.990]  In this episode, we are going to revisit episodes 378, 380, 383, 385, 387 and 388.
[01:43.990 --> 01:47.830]  So ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, let's travel back in time and revisit these
[01:47.830 --> 01:48.830]  grow lessons.
[01:48.830 --> 01:55.020]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[01:55.020 --> 01:58.780]  It's time for episode 378 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:58.780 --> 02:01.500]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:01.500 --> 02:05.660]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[02:05.660 --> 02:11.740]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[02:11.740 --> 02:15.500]  It's usually a tradition that I start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[02:15.500 --> 02:18.740]  Honestly, today I feel like total shit and I haven't been dabbing.
[02:18.740 --> 02:20.300]  I'm giving my body a little bit of a rest.
[02:20.300 --> 02:21.300]  I've got a head cold.
[02:21.300 --> 02:22.300]  I've got a chest cold.
[02:22.300 --> 02:25.820]  I've got this sinus thing going on that is driving me completely crazy.
[02:25.820 --> 02:27.660]  So I'm not going to take any dabs before the show.
[02:27.820 --> 02:32.140]  I'm going to try to keep my shit together and deliver you guys a decent podcast.
[02:32.140 --> 02:34.620]  In the last episode, I promised another grow lesson.
[02:34.620 --> 02:38.620]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[02:38.620 --> 02:41.140]  The grow series started at episode 351.
[02:41.140 --> 02:44.780]  If you haven't caught up, I suggest you head back to episode 351.
[02:44.780 --> 02:49.480]  In episode 351, we set a goal for our garden and then we move on to selecting a space for
[02:49.480 --> 02:50.480]  our garden.
[02:50.480 --> 02:52.060]  We also select the proper equipment.
[02:52.060 --> 02:53.460]  Then we build the grow room.
[02:53.460 --> 02:55.300]  Then we talk about seeds and clones.
[02:55.300 --> 02:56.580]  Then we veg our plants.
[02:56.580 --> 03:00.020]  Then we talk about a few tricks and tips to get our plants up to speed for quality
[03:00.020 --> 03:01.020]  production.
[03:01.020 --> 03:04.660]  At this point in my grow lessons, it is day one of flower.
[03:04.660 --> 03:11.100]  It is time to flip our crop from the vegetative phase into the flowering phase of our grow.
[03:11.100 --> 03:12.420]  So I'm going to press pause for a moment.
[03:12.420 --> 03:15.420]  I'm going to listen back to this intro and see how I sound.
[03:15.420 --> 03:19.940]  When I come back, we are going to talk about flowering our new cannabis garden.
[03:19.940 --> 03:21.420]  All right, podcast world.
[03:21.420 --> 03:24.540]  I apologize that I do sound kind of crappy, but the show must go on.
[03:24.540 --> 03:26.140]  I've been promising this episode.
[03:26.700 --> 03:29.740]  I may make this one kind of quick and then recap next week and move forward.
[03:29.740 --> 03:34.500]  My original idea was to do a three-week chunk of flowering episodes.
[03:34.500 --> 03:38.660]  We would do week one through three and then four through six and seven through nine, but
[03:38.660 --> 03:42.700]  we are going to focus on day one of week one today and then we will adjust from there in
[03:42.700 --> 03:44.580]  the following episodes.
[03:44.580 --> 03:47.940]  So let's get started on flowering our cannabis garden.
[03:47.940 --> 03:49.320]  What do I mean by flowering?
[03:49.320 --> 03:52.060]  We want to initiate the budding phase.
[03:52.060 --> 03:57.260]  The flowering phase for regular cannabis plants is triggered by reducing the light cycle.
[03:57.260 --> 04:01.500]  If you were working with auto flower plants, you were in a total different ballgame.
[04:01.500 --> 04:04.020]  Those plants will flower when they are ready.
[04:04.020 --> 04:08.380]  For this discussion, we're going to focus on regular photo period plants and photo period
[04:08.380 --> 04:09.380]  seeds.
[04:09.380 --> 04:12.740]  So let's talk about flowering our photo period garden.
[04:12.740 --> 04:14.140]  Initiating flower is very easy.
[04:14.140 --> 04:18.700]  All we do is reduce the timer to 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
[04:18.700 --> 04:24.820]  We need 12 hours of uninterrupted darkness every day to trigger these plants to flower.
[04:24.820 --> 04:27.820]  I've said it several times, but I'm going to repeat myself.
[04:27.820 --> 04:33.460]  We need total uninterrupted darkness during the night phase for our flowering plants.
[04:33.460 --> 04:35.620]  A little bit of light is too much.
[04:35.620 --> 04:40.300]  If you can see a pinprick of light coming in that room, it is too much light.
[04:40.300 --> 04:44.140]  If you can see your hand in front of your face during the dark phase in that room, it
[04:44.140 --> 04:45.380]  is too much light.
[04:45.380 --> 04:47.220]  Those plants know that that light is there.
[04:47.220 --> 04:49.000]  They will not go to sleep properly.
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.700]  They will not flower properly.
[04:50.700 --> 04:54.820]  If they do try to flower properly, you give them the chance of hermaphroditing on you
[04:54.820 --> 04:59.340]  in mid flower, which will produce seeds in your garden, which will ruin your whole goal.
[04:59.340 --> 05:04.660]  So we need 100% total darkness in our flowering room during the night phase.
[05:04.660 --> 05:06.580]  So switch the timer to 1212.
[05:06.580 --> 05:09.660]  Be sure that you have got total dark in that dark phase.
[05:09.660 --> 05:11.020]  You need to go in there and look.
[05:11.020 --> 05:15.300]  You probably need to hang out in the grow room for about 15 to 20 minutes for your eyes
[05:15.300 --> 05:20.740]  to adjust properly to identify the most minimal light leaks you could possibly have.
[05:20.740 --> 05:24.060]  So go in there and check for light leaks on day one of flower.
[05:24.060 --> 05:26.940]  If you have any light coming in, you need to correct that.
[05:26.940 --> 05:29.100]  That will ruin your garden.
[05:29.100 --> 05:30.900]  So we've set the timer to 1212.
[05:30.900 --> 05:35.020]  Now it is on for 12 hours a day and it is off for 12 hours a day.
[05:35.020 --> 05:38.420]  Put a lot of thought into the hours which your lights run.
[05:38.420 --> 05:41.340]  Do you want those lights to come on in the morning when you wake up so you can water
[05:41.340 --> 05:44.740]  the plants before you go to work and then the plants are on all day while you're gone
[05:44.740 --> 05:45.740]  at work?
[05:45.740 --> 05:48.500]  Hopefully you get to come home and check them out before the lights turn off.
[05:48.500 --> 05:52.140]  Or do you want those lights to come on in the evening right when you get home from work
[05:52.140 --> 05:55.540]  and the lights can run all night while you're home and you can check on everything?
[05:55.540 --> 05:57.340]  Maybe you can get up before work and they're still on.
[05:57.340 --> 06:00.220]  You can check on them again before you go to work and make sure everything's cool.
[06:00.220 --> 06:03.900]  I would put a lot of thought into scheduling my flowering cycle.
[06:03.900 --> 06:08.260]  Another thing to consider while you're planning your schedule is electricity is cheaper during
[06:08.260 --> 06:09.980]  off peak hours.
[06:09.980 --> 06:13.820]  That means that during the evenings when everybody goes home and they're chilling, electricity
[06:13.900 --> 06:15.060]  gets cheaper.
[06:15.060 --> 06:19.060]  During the daytime business hours when everybody's using all of the electricity, the electric
[06:19.060 --> 06:22.300]  company does charge you more for those peak hours.
[06:22.300 --> 06:26.780]  What many folks will choose to do is run those lights during off peak hours and save money
[06:26.780 --> 06:28.100]  on electricity.
[06:28.100 --> 06:31.700]  This is also advantageous because it is cooler during the evenings.
[06:31.700 --> 06:34.460]  You don't have the sun up keeping your grow room extra hot.
[06:34.460 --> 06:37.720]  You're not heating the outside with the sun and the inside with the grow lights.
[06:37.720 --> 06:39.820]  The sun goes down and gets a little cooler outside.
[06:39.820 --> 06:44.500]  You can use that cool outside air to your advantage and keep the grow room cool.
[06:44.500 --> 06:45.900]  Think about your scheduling.
[06:45.900 --> 06:48.760]  When do you want that 12-12 on cycle to be?
[06:48.760 --> 06:51.780]  When do you want that 12-12 off cycle to be?
[06:51.780 --> 06:56.820]  If you do decide to run your lights at night and have your dark cycle during the natural
[06:56.820 --> 07:03.140]  light cycle, be sure that no sunshine is creeping into your grow room during that night cycle.
[07:03.140 --> 07:04.900]  Again, we need total darkness.
[07:04.900 --> 07:08.660]  A very common mistake is that people flower their plants at night, which means they're
[07:08.660 --> 07:12.940]  in the sleep cycle during the day, which means there's the opportunity for the sunshine
[07:12.940 --> 07:14.380]  to sneak into your grow room.
[07:14.380 --> 07:18.680]  If you've got a window, if you've got a doorway, if you've got some kind of insecure structure,
[07:18.680 --> 07:22.380]  you can get light in there very easily and it will destroy your crop.
[07:22.380 --> 07:25.520]  You've thought about scheduling and you know how it's going to work around your work schedule.
[07:25.520 --> 07:28.060]  You know how it's going to work around your life and you know when you're going to flower
[07:28.060 --> 07:29.060]  these plants.
[07:29.060 --> 07:32.580]  You know when you'll have time to give them maintenance and work on them and water them.
[07:32.580 --> 07:34.260]  Plan your scheduling around that.
[07:34.260 --> 07:36.380]  We have set the timer to 12-12.
[07:36.380 --> 07:38.440]  That is day one of flower.
[07:38.440 --> 07:41.520]  That first short day is day one.
[07:41.520 --> 07:42.880]  Write that day down.
[07:42.880 --> 07:46.240]  Too many people forget to write that down and they don't know how long their plants
[07:46.240 --> 07:47.760]  have been in flower.
[07:47.760 --> 07:51.360]  Write down your flowering start date.
[07:51.360 --> 07:54.920]  Another thing I want to make clear is this is day one of flower.
[07:54.920 --> 07:59.920]  If you've got a package of seeds and it says takes 70 to 80 days to flower, this is the
[07:59.920 --> 08:04.000]  first day of that 70 to 80 days of that finishing time.
[08:04.000 --> 08:08.840]  A lot of folks like to start the flowering phase when they see bud set starting, when
[08:08.840 --> 08:10.240]  they see pre-flowers.
[08:10.240 --> 08:14.280]  You were 12 days into flower by then and you were ripping yourself off.
[08:14.280 --> 08:18.120]  Flowering starts the day we change the timer to 12-12.
[08:18.120 --> 08:19.360]  That is day one of flower.
[08:19.360 --> 08:21.700]  We've now switched the timer to 12-12.
[08:21.700 --> 08:25.180]  The plants will be on for 12 hours a day and off for 12 hours.
[08:25.180 --> 08:26.600]  They're going to start flowering.
[08:26.600 --> 08:31.180]  Let's talk about the environmental conditions we need to provide for our flowering plants
[08:31.180 --> 08:33.280]  here at the beginning of flower.
[08:33.280 --> 08:35.520]  This will change as the plants progress.
[08:35.520 --> 08:37.560]  Right now we don't have any buds to worry about.
[08:37.560 --> 08:41.600]  There are much less opportunities for mildew and molds to take hold because when you get
[08:41.600 --> 08:45.560]  those chunky buds, the mildew likes to start in the middle of those buds.
[08:45.560 --> 08:47.120]  That's not really a worry right now.
[08:47.120 --> 08:49.120]  We can have the humidity a little higher at this point.
[08:49.120 --> 08:51.280]  We can have the temps a little higher at this point.
[08:51.280 --> 08:54.980]  As we progress, we are going to lower the humidity and the temperature in our flowering
[08:54.980 --> 08:59.560]  room to accommodate those big chunky buds and to prevent problems.
[08:59.560 --> 09:05.400]  At this phase of the game, it would be ideal to have your grow room between 70 and 80 degrees
[09:05.400 --> 09:06.400]  Fahrenheit.
[09:06.400 --> 09:08.000]  I do not recommend higher than 80.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.240]  I do not recommend lower than 70.
[09:10.240 --> 09:12.960]  I understand that you're struggling to keep your room cool.
[09:12.960 --> 09:16.200]  A lot of new growers have issues keeping the grow room cool.
[09:16.200 --> 09:19.280]  84 is the max you ever want to hit.
[09:19.280 --> 09:23.120]  When you hit 85 degrees and higher, your plants will stop producing.
[09:23.120 --> 09:27.120]  They will just go into a stagnant, dead, slowed down mode.
[09:27.120 --> 09:30.440]  How productive do you want to be when it's 110 degrees outside?
[09:30.440 --> 09:31.440]  You just feel like shit.
[09:31.440 --> 09:32.440]  You don't want to do anything.
[09:32.440 --> 09:33.440]  You don't want to move.
[09:33.440 --> 09:34.880]  The plants feel the same way.
[09:34.880 --> 09:36.940]  The plants can't move themselves to some shade.
[09:36.940 --> 09:39.000]  The plants can't grab some water and take a drink.
[09:39.000 --> 09:40.800]  Those plants are stuck there.
[09:40.800 --> 09:42.420]  Give them the proper environment.
[09:42.420 --> 09:43.480]  Don't go too hot.
[09:43.480 --> 09:44.880]  Don't go too cold.
[09:44.880 --> 09:50.320]  At this phase of the flowering cycle, I would recommend 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit during
[09:50.320 --> 09:52.660]  your lights on cycle.
[09:52.660 --> 09:56.080]  Now let's talk a little bit about the humidity of this grow room.
[09:56.080 --> 10:01.080]  During the start of the flowering phase, I like to have about 40 to 50% humidity.
[10:01.080 --> 10:04.160]  Earlier I said we don't have those big buds to worry about, so we've just got a bunch
[10:04.160 --> 10:05.360]  of lush, happy plants.
[10:05.360 --> 10:08.840]  They're just in there sucking up all that humidity and growing like crazy.
[10:08.840 --> 10:15.560]  So 40 to 50% relative humidity and 70 to 80 degrees during your daytime cycle.
[10:15.560 --> 10:19.760]  If you really want to dial that in, I recommend you check out my episode about vapor pressure
[10:19.760 --> 10:20.880]  deficit.
[10:20.880 --> 10:24.560]  And that was episode number 314 if you're interested in learning more about the vapor
[10:24.560 --> 10:28.700]  pressure deficit, which I find to be very important when it comes to dialing in the
[10:28.700 --> 10:29.960]  grow room perfectly.
[10:29.960 --> 10:34.680]  VPD will really improve the productivity of your plants if you understand it and dial
[10:34.680 --> 10:36.260]  it in correctly.
[10:36.260 --> 10:37.680]  So that is the daytime condition.
[10:37.680 --> 10:42.200]  We want 70 to 80 degrees during the day, 40 to 50% relative humidity.
[10:42.200 --> 10:44.260]  Let's talk about the nighttime temperatures.
[10:44.260 --> 10:47.440]  When we turn off the light, things are going to change in that grow room.
[10:47.440 --> 10:50.800]  I try to keep the humidity right around the same levels at nighttime at this stage of
[10:50.800 --> 10:51.800]  flowering.
[10:51.800 --> 10:55.240]  So I'm going to leave it at 40 to 50% humidity during the night cycle.
[10:55.240 --> 10:58.360]  Now during the night cycle, I like it to get a little bit cooler.
[10:58.360 --> 11:00.080]  It naturally cools off at night.
[11:00.080 --> 11:04.120]  So I feel like the plants probably enjoy a little bit cooler of a temperature at night.
[11:04.120 --> 11:10.120]  I try not to go any more than 10 degrees difference on a day and night temperature.
[11:10.120 --> 11:12.520]  That is called your diurnal temperature variation.
[11:12.520 --> 11:15.540]  And you don't want that to sway more than 10 degrees.
[11:15.540 --> 11:20.080]  So if during your day cycle, you're at 75, you do not want your night cycle to get any
[11:20.080 --> 11:23.120]  lower than 65 degrees.
[11:23.120 --> 11:27.420]  I would generally try to keep it about five degrees difference, but I understand we're
[11:27.420 --> 11:28.720]  building new grow rooms.
[11:28.720 --> 11:29.920]  We are learning our setups.
[11:29.920 --> 11:31.920]  We are learning to dial these rooms in.
[11:31.920 --> 11:36.500]  Five to 10 degrees is acceptable for a diurnal temperature variation.
[11:36.500 --> 11:40.860]  But if you go any more than five to 10 degrees differential in your day and night temperature,
[11:40.860 --> 11:43.060]  you will cause problems within the plant.
[11:43.060 --> 11:44.440]  The plants will be confused.
[11:44.440 --> 11:45.980]  The plants will begin to grow slowly.
[11:45.980 --> 11:49.200]  And this is also a great way to invite powdery mildew.
[11:49.320 --> 11:54.040]  So try to keep your temperature swings within 10 degrees from your day and nighttime temperature.
[11:54.040 --> 11:57.800]  Now when you're walking through the grow, sometimes just reach out and grab a plant
[11:57.800 --> 11:59.880]  and feel the temperature of the plant.
[11:59.880 --> 12:01.040]  Is the plant warm?
[12:01.040 --> 12:02.040]  Is the plant cold?
[12:02.040 --> 12:04.100]  How does the plant feel to your hands?
[12:04.100 --> 12:07.900]  If the plants feel really, really cold, they're probably really cold and you could probably
[12:07.900 --> 12:09.940]  increase the temperature of your room.
[12:09.940 --> 12:12.580]  If the plants feel like they're warm, they're probably warm.
[12:12.580 --> 12:15.840]  You can probably lower the temperature of your room.
[12:15.840 --> 12:19.820]  In the future, I do plan to do a discussion on leaf surface temperature versus ambient
[12:19.820 --> 12:22.000]  room temperature, but we are not there yet.
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.680]  So let's stay focused here.
[12:23.680 --> 12:27.540]  Now one thing I may have overlooked when I talked about equipment is a hygrometer and
[12:27.540 --> 12:32.760]  a thermometer or some sort of a monitoring device to know what is happening in our grow
[12:32.760 --> 12:34.980]  room at all times.
[12:34.980 --> 12:39.300]  Most of us growers can probably afford the hygrometer thermometer combo that sits in
[12:39.300 --> 12:43.540]  the grow room and it marks the humidity and temperature of the room, but it will also
[12:43.540 --> 12:46.760]  mark the highest and lowest points of your humidity and temperature.
[12:46.760 --> 12:50.840]  So you can find your peaks and your valleys and identify the temperature and humidity
[12:50.840 --> 12:52.840]  fluctuations in your room.
[12:52.840 --> 12:56.400]  It's always nice to know where the peaks and valleys are, but I like to have more data.
[12:56.400 --> 13:00.200]  I like to have something in the room that can tell me what's going on at all times.
[13:00.200 --> 13:03.780]  For a reliable monitor that can keep you up to date on what's happening in your grow room
[13:03.780 --> 13:08.640]  at all times, I would suggest something like a PO Grow Systems Minder Unit or perhaps a
[13:08.640 --> 13:10.320]  Smart Bee Unit.
[13:10.320 --> 13:13.700]  You can use both of those units to monitor your grow room at all times.
[13:13.700 --> 13:15.500]  You can pull up the data on your phone.
[13:15.500 --> 13:18.300]  You can see what's happening in the room in real time.
[13:18.300 --> 13:21.820]  Some of these types of units allow you to actually plug in other devices and trigger
[13:21.820 --> 13:23.280]  them from your smartphone.
[13:23.280 --> 13:27.380]  So if you were away, you open up your application, you see that it's too warm in that room, you
[13:27.380 --> 13:29.580]  can say, hey, let's just easily turn on the air conditioner.
[13:29.580 --> 13:33.020]  You can click a button on a tab on your phone and it will fire up the air conditioner in
[13:33.020 --> 13:37.080]  your grow room and you can rescue your garden while you're at lunch, hanging out with your
[13:37.080 --> 13:39.600]  friends and you don't even have to leave the table.
[13:39.600 --> 13:43.900]  So my point is, have some way to monitor the temperature and humidity in your grow
[13:43.900 --> 13:45.060]  room at all times.
[13:45.060 --> 13:48.260]  I like to have a report of what happens when those lights go off.
[13:48.260 --> 13:51.020]  You have been running that grow light for 12 hours in that room.
[13:51.020 --> 13:52.220]  You have created a lot of heat.
[13:52.220 --> 13:53.900]  You have created a lot of energy.
[13:53.900 --> 13:56.860]  All of that heat, all of that light energy has created humidity.
[13:56.860 --> 13:58.700]  There's water rising up in the air.
[13:58.700 --> 14:01.020]  Now when we kill that light, everything changes.
[14:01.020 --> 14:03.700]  All of that humidity in the air is no longer being heated.
[14:03.700 --> 14:05.420]  It's got the opportunity to start falling.
[14:05.420 --> 14:07.480]  It becomes kind of thick in the grow room.
[14:07.480 --> 14:12.580]  That short time period while the room stabilizes itself out from that change is quite often
[14:12.580 --> 14:17.340]  the cause of many of our powdery mildew and boitritis issues.
[14:17.340 --> 14:20.940]  And many growers don't even know that that is happening in the room at that time.
[14:20.940 --> 14:24.740]  They look at their hygrometer, they look at their thermometer, they say, oh, it was 72
[14:24.740 --> 14:25.740]  degrees in here.
[14:25.740 --> 14:26.740]  That's acceptable.
[14:26.740 --> 14:28.580]  Oh, it was 45% humidity in here.
[14:28.580 --> 14:29.580]  That's acceptable.
[14:29.580 --> 14:35.060]  You don't realize that there was a point where it was 78 degrees and about 82% humidity in
[14:35.060 --> 14:36.060]  the room.
[14:36.060 --> 14:37.640]  And that's because we turned off that light.
[14:37.640 --> 14:39.920]  All that moisture that was in the air is now falling.
[14:39.920 --> 14:43.440]  Now the plants don't have light anymore, so they are starting to respirate a little bit.
[14:43.440 --> 14:45.360]  They're letting out a little more moisture.
[14:45.360 --> 14:49.840]  And all of that chaos can really cause problems for our plants in that type of environment.
[14:49.840 --> 14:54.640]  So my point is, try to know what's happening environmentally in your rooms at all times.
[14:54.640 --> 14:58.200]  All right, it feels like we know what our environment should be like.
[14:58.200 --> 15:02.640]  Let's talk a little bit about feeding our transitioning cannabis plants.
[15:02.640 --> 15:06.380]  If you are working in a no-till bed or you're working with super soil, there's no need to
[15:06.380 --> 15:08.220]  adjust anything at this time.
[15:08.220 --> 15:09.380]  Just keep doing what you're doing.
[15:09.380 --> 15:13.260]  You basically need to water the plants throughout the flowering cycle.
[15:13.260 --> 15:17.380]  If you plan on adding a cover crop or a top dress or maybe feeding some teas, you will
[15:17.380 --> 15:19.820]  need to adjust your teas at this time.
[15:19.820 --> 15:24.300]  I would take the nitrogen products out and focus more on the phosphorus and potassium
[15:24.300 --> 15:28.380]  at this time if you're running teas or top dress or a cover crop.
[15:28.380 --> 15:32.620]  Now if you are working with bottled nutrients, you can probably just swap out that veg bottle
[15:32.620 --> 15:35.700]  and replace it with the flowering nutrients.
[15:35.700 --> 15:40.260]  Most of the bottled nutrient companies make it very easy to follow their nutrient schedule.
[15:40.260 --> 15:43.960]  So simply swap out that veg bottle, put in the bloom bottle, and everything should be
[15:43.960 --> 15:45.400]  good to go.
[15:45.400 --> 15:48.920]  The main difference in our feeding schedule at this time is that we are going to reduce
[15:48.920 --> 15:53.440]  the amount of nitrogen and we are going to slowly start increasing the amount of phosphorus
[15:53.440 --> 15:55.060]  and potassium.
[15:55.060 --> 16:00.320]  Our plants take up approximately 80 to 90% of their nitrogen during the veg phase.
[16:00.320 --> 16:04.100]  Once we switch them into flower, they are done sucking up nitrogen and they want more
[16:04.100 --> 16:09.200]  phosphorus and potassium so they can build robust branches and big fat buds.
[16:09.200 --> 16:13.800]  So let's reduce the nitrogen and start increasing the phosphorus and potassium.
[16:13.800 --> 16:17.500]  That part should mostly be covered by your base nutrients.
[16:17.500 --> 16:21.320]  If you're running a one-bottled base nutrient, a two-part or a three-part, you should be
[16:21.320 --> 16:26.680]  getting the proper nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium from your base nutrients.
[16:26.680 --> 16:29.840]  Now there are a few more things that these plants can use at this phase.
[16:29.860 --> 16:31.440]  I like to add silica.
[16:31.440 --> 16:35.460]  When I am mixing up my nutrient solution, I always put potassium silicates in the water
[16:35.460 --> 16:36.460]  first.
[16:36.460 --> 16:38.640]  The potassium silicates go first.
[16:38.640 --> 16:40.860]  Then I mix in my base nutrients.
[16:40.860 --> 16:43.880]  These plants can probably use cow mag at this point in time.
[16:43.880 --> 16:48.080]  I also like to give the plants some sort of a root inoculant early in flower.
[16:48.080 --> 16:49.540]  Don't cut back the microbes.
[16:49.540 --> 16:50.540]  Keep them going.
[16:50.540 --> 16:51.960]  Keep those roots growing strong.
[16:51.960 --> 16:52.960]  Keep them healthy.
[16:52.960 --> 16:55.360]  The plants will continue to flourish in flower.
[16:55.360 --> 16:57.020]  I also like some enzymes.
[16:57.020 --> 16:59.840]  Those enzymes serve several purposes.
[16:59.840 --> 17:03.460]  The enzymes will basically help to keep the root zone clean, and they will also break
[17:03.460 --> 17:08.380]  down any decaying root matter and turn that into usable energy for my plants.
[17:08.380 --> 17:10.380]  I also like to add some carbohydrates.
[17:10.380 --> 17:12.980]  The carbohydrates serve a couple of purposes.
[17:12.980 --> 17:15.260]  Those carbs will feed my microbes.
[17:15.260 --> 17:17.940]  Those carbs will also give my plants energy.
[17:17.940 --> 17:22.460]  Between the carbs, the enzymes, and the mycos, my root zone is really healthy and really
[17:22.460 --> 17:26.420]  active, which will show up top at the top of our plants.
[17:26.500 --> 17:30.260]  We are focusing on nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium at this stage.
[17:30.260 --> 17:33.900]  We are shifting away from the nitrogen more toward the phosphorus and potassium.
[17:33.900 --> 17:37.060]  It's always good to add cow mag, a little bit of a root inoculant.
[17:37.060 --> 17:40.060]  I like some enzymes, always some carbs.
[17:40.060 --> 17:43.900]  To make everything pop, I would add a little bit of fulvic acid.
[17:43.900 --> 17:48.020]  If you've chosen to work with a specific bottled nutrient company, most of those companies
[17:48.020 --> 17:50.740]  have a nutrient calculator on their website.
[17:50.740 --> 17:53.380]  You can go to whatevernutrientcompany.com.
[17:53.380 --> 17:55.300]  You can find their nutrient calculator.
[17:55.300 --> 17:57.660]  You can type in how many weeks you're going to flower.
[17:57.660 --> 18:01.280]  You can click on which products of theirs you have purchased, and it will tell you week
[18:01.280 --> 18:05.060]  by week how much of each product to use.
[18:05.060 --> 18:08.980]  Most of those charts are reliable, but keep in mind, they want you to continue buying
[18:08.980 --> 18:13.980]  products, so they may recommend you use a little more than necessary for an ideal crop
[18:13.980 --> 18:14.980]  situation.
[18:14.980 --> 18:20.860]  I generally reduce the recommended dosage by about 25%.
[18:20.860 --> 18:25.960]  If it says to feed 100 milliliters of your base product, I would start off with 75 milliliters
[18:25.960 --> 18:27.820]  and see what happens.
[18:27.820 --> 18:31.560]  We can always feed the plants a little more later, but we can never take out the feeding
[18:31.560 --> 18:32.780]  once we've put it in.
[18:32.780 --> 18:34.380]  So don't burn the plants.
[18:34.380 --> 18:38.800]  Wait for them to show you that they are happy or that they are angry and adjust from there.
[18:38.800 --> 18:43.180]  Most of these nutrient companies offer a fairly balanced diet within their own product line.
[18:43.180 --> 18:46.740]  You shouldn't have to reach out to another brand or another company and fill in anything
[18:46.740 --> 18:48.260]  that they are missing.
[18:48.260 --> 18:54.680]  If you do choose to mix nutrient lines, be very careful that you don't double up on anything.
[18:54.680 --> 18:58.560]  When Nutrient Company A made their product lines, they made five bottles and they put
[18:58.560 --> 19:02.660]  the base newts in one, they put the cow mag in the other, they put the humic acid in another
[19:02.660 --> 19:04.300]  and a bloom booster in another.
[19:04.300 --> 19:07.660]  They know what is in each bottle and they can recommend your feeding because they know
[19:07.660 --> 19:11.660]  they're not going to overdose anything with their design.
[19:11.660 --> 19:16.280]  When you introduce a product from another company, you run the risk of doubling up on
[19:16.280 --> 19:18.400]  specific nutrients.
[19:18.400 --> 19:23.040]  Nutrient Company A and Nutrient Company B did not talk to each other about their designs.
[19:23.040 --> 19:27.160]  So you may be running a base product from Nutrient Company A, then you may have a bloom
[19:27.160 --> 19:31.020]  booster from Nutrient Company B. Those companies didn't talk.
[19:31.020 --> 19:34.840]  Company A was putting cow mag inside their base nutrient to help you out and save you
[19:34.840 --> 19:36.200]  with the bottle.
[19:36.200 --> 19:39.920]  Company B was putting the cow mag inside the bloom booster to help you out and save a bottle
[19:39.920 --> 19:40.920]  and you didn't know that.
[19:40.920 --> 19:45.420]  So now you just fed two doses of cow mag because you combined nutrient companies and didn't
[19:45.420 --> 19:46.420]  read the bottles.
[19:46.420 --> 19:50.340]  So if you choose to use products from two different companies, be sure not to overlap
[19:50.340 --> 19:52.060]  with any nutrients.
[19:52.060 --> 19:55.620]  If you know what's in each product and you understand how the plants use each of those
[19:55.620 --> 19:59.460]  products and you're not going to cause any problems, there is nothing wrong with combining
[19:59.460 --> 20:01.260]  nutrient companies.
[20:01.260 --> 20:04.780]  If you feel like the brand you were using is lacking something, feel free to purchase
[20:04.780 --> 20:09.620]  another product from another company and add that into your mix as long as you don't double
[20:09.620 --> 20:11.740]  up any specific elements.
[20:11.740 --> 20:15.180]  A good example of what I'm talking about is in a commercial environment, I like to run
[20:15.180 --> 20:17.580]  VegBloom powder nutrients.
[20:17.580 --> 20:22.140]  In my opinion, VegBloom could use a little bit of fulvic acid added to the mix.
[20:22.140 --> 20:26.620]  In my opinion, VegBloom can use a little bit of carbohydrates added to the mix later in
[20:26.620 --> 20:27.620]  flour.
[20:27.620 --> 20:30.580]  So I am comfortable adding those products and I've done my research.
[20:30.580 --> 20:35.300]  I know how much carbs, I know how much fulvic acid is in my starting product, so I know
[20:35.300 --> 20:37.300]  that I'm not going to overdose my plants.
[20:37.300 --> 20:40.020]  All right, I'm confident that we understand the environment.
[20:40.020 --> 20:42.780]  I'm confident that we understand what to feed the plants.
[20:42.780 --> 20:46.820]  Let's talk about some more techniques to do at the very start of flour.
[20:46.820 --> 20:53.280]  If you are using sprayed pesticide applications, now is a great time to apply a pesticide application.
[20:53.280 --> 20:55.500]  We are running out of time for sprays.
[20:55.500 --> 20:59.500]  We are going to start developing bud sites very soon, so we need to treat these plants
[20:59.500 --> 21:00.860]  today.
[21:00.860 --> 21:05.260]  Let's apply a preventative product to our plants to ensure we do not get any pests in
[21:05.260 --> 21:06.820]  our veg cycle.
[21:06.820 --> 21:10.740]  If you are not going to use spray pesticide applications, now is a good time to release
[21:10.740 --> 21:12.140]  your beneficial insects.
[21:12.140 --> 21:17.460]  We want to get them colonized and built up in the grow before other insects have an opportunity
[21:17.460 --> 21:19.740]  to take hold in our flowering garden.
[21:19.740 --> 21:23.940]  Once the plants are flowering, we don't have a lot of options for pest control, so let's
[21:23.940 --> 21:30.180]  do everything we can now to prevent a pest infestation while we have big chunky buds.
[21:30.180 --> 21:32.820]  So I would treat for pests at this time.
[21:32.820 --> 21:35.700]  Spray pesticides if that is your approach.
[21:35.700 --> 21:39.180]  Another thing I like to do on day one of flower is trellis my plants.
[21:39.180 --> 21:43.980]  In a commercial environment, I am not able to move my veg plants into a room and trellis
[21:43.980 --> 21:44.980]  them.
[21:44.980 --> 21:46.840]  I have a veg room and I have flowering rooms.
[21:46.840 --> 21:51.140]  The flowering rooms are constantly flowering, so I can't veg in that room.
[21:51.140 --> 21:55.740]  So I move the plants into the flowering area and I put the trellis up on day one, and I
[21:55.740 --> 22:00.020]  bend and pop and work those plants into the net on day one.
[22:00.020 --> 22:04.780]  This gives them plenty of time to recover from the stress of getting beat up while they
[22:04.860 --> 22:06.980]  transition to the flowering phase.
[22:06.980 --> 22:09.700]  We've got about seven to 10 days where they're just transitioning.
[22:09.700 --> 22:10.820]  There won't be any bud growth.
[22:10.820 --> 22:12.380]  There won't be any major activity.
[22:12.380 --> 22:15.900]  So if we beat them up on day one, we've got plenty of time to recover.
[22:15.900 --> 22:18.340]  So I like to get in there and get them under the trellis.
[22:18.340 --> 22:23.020]  I also do popping and twisting, which is also known as super cropping.
[22:23.020 --> 22:26.860]  I've talked about this in depth in other episodes, but I'll give you a quick rundown.
[22:26.860 --> 22:31.060]  I start at the very bottom stalk of the plant where it comes out of the dirt.
[22:31.060 --> 22:33.500]  I grab the base of the stalk with my left hand.
[22:33.500 --> 22:39.420]  I put my right hand above that and I grab the stalk and I twist my right hand counterclockwise.
[22:39.420 --> 22:41.260]  You'll hear a pop.
[22:41.260 --> 22:42.340]  Sounds kind of like a knuckle popping.
[22:42.340 --> 22:43.580]  I pop my knuckle into the microphone.
[22:43.580 --> 22:44.980]  I don't know if it picked up.
[22:44.980 --> 22:46.440]  You'll hear a little pop sound.
[22:46.440 --> 22:48.080]  That is the sound you're looking for.
[22:48.080 --> 22:52.260]  You just want to break the cellulose structure of that plant.
[22:52.260 --> 22:53.600]  So I'll break it once.
[22:53.600 --> 22:56.940]  Then I'll move my left hand from the bottom right up above my right hand and I'll give
[22:56.940 --> 22:57.940]  it another break.
[22:57.940 --> 22:59.980]  Then I'll move up and give it another break.
[22:59.980 --> 23:04.140]  I work my way up the main stem all the way until it gets real thin and I feel like I
[23:04.140 --> 23:07.300]  could cause problems by snapping it up there.
[23:07.300 --> 23:10.700]  Once I've done the main stalk, I go back down to the bottom of the plant and I find the
[23:10.700 --> 23:13.860]  lowest branch and I work that branch all the way up.
[23:13.860 --> 23:16.940]  Then I work every single branch on every single plant.
[23:16.940 --> 23:19.140]  This takes hours in a commercial environment.
[23:19.140 --> 23:23.300]  Your hands will be sore, but the plants will thank you for it in the future.
[23:23.300 --> 23:24.740]  Right now they look like they got twisted.
[23:24.740 --> 23:28.340]  They got a little bit beat up, but in a few days all of those twists will create what
[23:28.340 --> 23:29.340]  looks like a knuckle.
[23:29.460 --> 23:31.500]  It will make the plant more robust.
[23:31.500 --> 23:32.500]  It will make it stronger.
[23:32.500 --> 23:34.140]  It will give it more strength.
[23:34.140 --> 23:37.700]  I feel like those thicker stalks can move more nutrients, which makes a more productive
[23:37.700 --> 23:38.700]  plant.
[23:38.700 --> 23:40.860]  I feel like a bigger stalk can hold up a bigger bud.
[23:40.860 --> 23:44.980]  So we are working those plants to be more robust by cracking them.
[23:44.980 --> 23:47.180]  They heal themselves and they become stronger.
[23:47.180 --> 23:49.500]  So I like to do popping and twisting at this time.
[23:49.500 --> 23:54.100]  I also like to do a nice defoliation on day one of flower.
[23:54.100 --> 23:55.600]  Take out all that excess leaf.
[23:55.600 --> 23:56.820]  We don't need it.
[23:56.820 --> 23:59.900]  While I'm there, I like to clean up the bottoms quite a bit.
[23:59.900 --> 24:02.020]  Take off some of the crappy bottom branches.
[24:02.020 --> 24:03.900]  Take off some of those sucker branches.
[24:03.900 --> 24:05.340]  Take off all the bottom leaves.
[24:05.340 --> 24:08.620]  We don't need a lot of that crap on the bottom of our plants.
[24:08.620 --> 24:12.340]  Some people like to wait a little bit later, closer to week two, to do the bottoming and
[24:12.340 --> 24:13.340]  the lollipopping.
[24:13.340 --> 24:14.540]  I like to do it early.
[24:14.540 --> 24:16.960]  In a commercial environment, things will get ahead of you.
[24:16.960 --> 24:21.500]  So if you don't start it right away, it gets really easy to fall behind very quickly.
[24:21.500 --> 24:24.220]  And in a commercial environment, that only compounds.
[24:24.220 --> 24:27.060]  So on day one, I move the plants into the flower room.
[24:27.060 --> 24:28.260]  I set up the trellis.
[24:28.260 --> 24:31.380]  I give the plants a nice pop and twist and work them into the trellis.
[24:31.380 --> 24:32.620]  I'll do some defoliating.
[24:32.620 --> 24:35.180]  I like to do a bunch of bottoming and lollipopping.
[24:35.180 --> 24:40.580]  And then right before we leave for the night, we give the plants a nice pesticide spray.
[24:40.580 --> 24:45.180]  Another important thing to think about at this transitional time is bulbs.
[24:45.180 --> 24:48.340]  What kind of bulbs are you going to use for flowering?
[24:48.340 --> 24:53.260]  I usually recommend a metal halide for vegging and a high pressure sodium for flowering.
[24:53.300 --> 24:58.140]  Flowering technology has advanced so far in recent years that you may be using LEDs.
[24:58.140 --> 25:00.220]  You may be using ceramic metal halides.
[25:00.220 --> 25:05.900]  There are tons of options, but consider changing your spectrum early in the flowering phase.
[25:05.900 --> 25:10.500]  One useful trick I have learned to help reduce the early flower stretch is to leave the metal
[25:10.500 --> 25:14.120]  halide bulbs in for the first two weeks of flowering.
[25:14.120 --> 25:17.900]  A lot of people will swap out the metal halides for the high pressure sodiums on day one of
[25:17.900 --> 25:18.900]  flowering.
[25:18.900 --> 25:22.980]  I have learned that if you leave those halides in there for two weeks, your plants will not
[25:22.980 --> 25:26.060]  stretch as ridiculously when you initiate flower.
[25:26.060 --> 25:27.580]  That is natural for plants to stretch.
[25:27.580 --> 25:29.100]  They just want to take off.
[25:29.100 --> 25:33.900]  But cracking them, popping them, twisting them, and keeping in that metal halide will
[25:33.900 --> 25:36.220]  drastically slow down that stretch.
[25:36.220 --> 25:40.660]  All right, podcast world, I feel like we have a good solid foundation on transitioning our
[25:40.660 --> 25:43.020]  plants from veg to flower.
[25:43.020 --> 25:47.500]  At this point, if you are growing from seeds, you will need to keep a close eye on the plants
[25:47.500 --> 25:49.020]  and look out for males.
[25:49.020 --> 25:53.260]  You will need to look out for hermaphrodites, and you will need to pay attention for mutants.
[25:53.260 --> 25:56.260]  If you've got a plant in there doing some weird shit, you need to decide if you want
[25:56.260 --> 25:58.500]  to keep it or let it finish.
[25:58.500 --> 26:01.540]  Sometimes those mutant plants put off amazing products.
[26:01.540 --> 26:04.860]  They are also a pain in the ass to grow, and they are problematic, so sometimes it's not
[26:04.860 --> 26:05.860]  even worth it.
[26:05.860 --> 26:09.540]  So if you've got a mutant, it is up to you to decide what to do.
[26:09.540 --> 26:12.300]  Another thing we need to stay on top of is scouting for insects.
[26:12.300 --> 26:14.380]  Yes, we did just apply some pesticides.
[26:14.380 --> 26:18.980]  We may have released some predator bugs, but that does not mean that we are bulletproof.
[26:18.980 --> 26:22.340]  Always be scouting for pests every day.
[26:22.340 --> 26:25.900]  As you walk through the grow, just to go from one end to the other, to go get the scissors
[26:25.900 --> 26:30.720]  you forgot down there, or to go find the broom, just glance at the plants as you walk by.
[26:30.720 --> 26:33.460]  That is when I make the most random discoveries.
[26:33.460 --> 26:34.940]  I'm not even looking for something.
[26:34.940 --> 26:38.220]  I was just walking by, and I said, what the hell is that out of the corner of my eye?
[26:38.220 --> 26:39.460]  Now I know there's a problem.
[26:39.460 --> 26:40.540]  Now we can solve it.
[26:40.540 --> 26:41.700]  Always be paying attention.
[26:41.700 --> 26:44.280]  Always be scouting for bugs and problems in the grow.
[26:44.280 --> 26:45.580]  Keep your eyes open.
[26:45.580 --> 26:46.960]  We need to look for hermaphrodites.
[26:46.960 --> 26:48.280]  We need to look for males.
[26:48.280 --> 26:52.200]  We need to look for mutants, and we need to pay close attention for signs of pests.
[26:52.200 --> 26:55.920]  All right, podcast world, I can feel the cold medicine that I took starting to kick in.
[26:55.920 --> 26:57.040]  My face is going numb.
[26:57.040 --> 26:58.720]  My nose is starting to run kind of weird.
[26:58.720 --> 27:02.560]  I need to wrap up this podcast before I get too lit to be on a microphone.
[27:02.560 --> 27:05.000]  I want to thank everybody for listening to The Grow Lessons.

[28:02.700 --> 28:04.520]  I'll be back Thursday with a fresh new episode.
[28:04.520 --> 28:08.840]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Hashmasta, and until next time, take a fat
[28:08.840 --> 28:12.560]  dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[28:12.560 --> 28:13.680]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[28:13.760 --> 28:17.040]  It's time for episode 380 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[28:17.040 --> 28:19.980]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[28:19.980 --> 28:24.200]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[28:24.200 --> 28:29.800]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[28:29.800 --> 28:33.440]  You know I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[28:33.440 --> 28:37.880]  Today I've been taking dabs of Stardog Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary.
[28:38.880 --> 28:45.200]  The label says 64.7% THC and a total of 76.4 total cannabinoids.
[28:45.200 --> 28:46.600]  I always love Stardog.
[28:46.600 --> 28:48.640]  It is one of my favorite strains to grow.
[28:48.640 --> 28:51.000]  It's one of my favorite strains to take photos of.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.240]  It is always one of my favorite strains to smoke.
[28:53.240 --> 28:54.320]  I love the aroma.
[28:54.320 --> 28:58.120]  I love the flavor, and I always love that nice head buzz from the Stardog.
[28:58.120 --> 29:00.040]  So today I'm taking dabs of Stardog.
[29:00.040 --> 29:03.760]  I feel like that will make for a great podcast.
[29:03.760 --> 29:06.140]  This episode is going to be another grow lesson.
[29:06.140 --> 29:10.200]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[29:10.200 --> 29:12.500]  We started by setting a goal for our garden.
[29:12.500 --> 29:14.140]  We found a right place for our garden.
[29:14.140 --> 29:16.620]  We selected and purchased the appropriate equipment.
[29:16.620 --> 29:21.500]  At this point in the grow, we are past week one of flower, and we are entering week two
[29:21.500 --> 29:23.380]  of the flowering phase.
[29:23.380 --> 29:27.940]  This episode will highlight weeks two and three, or days eight through 21 of the flowering
[29:27.940 --> 29:28.940]  phase.
[29:28.940 --> 29:32.220]  If you feel like you need a better foundation and you haven't been listening to the show,
[29:32.220 --> 29:38.140]  I recommend you head back to episode 351 and start on the grow lessons in episode 351.
[29:38.140 --> 29:41.620]  If you've been following along and you feel like you're up to speed, let's jump right
[29:41.620 --> 29:43.420]  into a grow lesson.
[29:43.420 --> 29:47.540]  In this episode, we're going to focus on weeks two and three of the flowering phase, also
[29:47.540 --> 29:49.840]  known as days eight through 21.
[29:49.840 --> 29:53.820]  Before we get there, let's recap a little bit of the previous episode.
[29:53.820 --> 29:59.180]  In the last episode, we changed our timer to 12 hours on and 12 hours off to initiate
[29:59.180 --> 30:00.180]  flower.
[30:00.180 --> 30:03.300]  We are now seven days into the flowering phase.
[30:03.300 --> 30:07.100]  Hopefully at this point, you have not over fertilized or ran into any pH issues with
[30:07.100 --> 30:08.460]  your garden.
[30:08.460 --> 30:12.180]  Hopefully at this point, you have not interrupted the dark cycle at all.
[30:12.180 --> 30:15.780]  Interrupting that dark cycle will disrupt the flowering phase and throw your plants
[30:15.780 --> 30:19.780]  into shock and possibly cause hermaphrodites.
[30:19.780 --> 30:23.120]  Hopefully the garden has remained pest and pathogen free.
[30:23.120 --> 30:28.740]  So if everything is on the right track, let's move in to week two or day eight of the flowering
[30:28.740 --> 30:30.200]  phase.
[30:30.200 --> 30:34.620]  At this stage of the flowering process, we're not going to notice much change from the vegetative
[30:34.620 --> 30:35.620]  cycle.
[30:35.620 --> 30:36.860]  You may notice a little bit of stretch.
[30:36.860 --> 30:40.420]  The plants may have taken off and they're starting to get a little bit taller on you.
[30:40.420 --> 30:43.020]  Some of your plants may be showing pre-flower.
[30:43.020 --> 30:46.660]  Some of your plants may start indicating sex around this time.
[30:46.660 --> 30:48.700]  Don't stress if they are not showing you sex yet.
[30:48.700 --> 30:50.820]  We still have plenty of time.
[30:50.820 --> 30:53.560]  But the main thing you're going to see at this point is stretch.
[30:53.560 --> 30:55.900]  Those plants are starting to grow taller.
[30:55.900 --> 30:56.900]  That is okay.
[30:57.060 --> 30:58.060]  That is exactly what we're expecting.
[30:58.060 --> 31:02.420]  For the first three weeks, we're going to see a lot of stretching happening to these
[31:02.420 --> 31:03.420]  plants.
[31:03.420 --> 31:07.620]  Now we will probably start seeing pre-flower and bud sets starting to develop around day
[31:07.620 --> 31:08.940]  10 or 12.
[31:08.940 --> 31:13.980]  We will definitely have little dandelion looking bud sets popping up around day 14.
[31:13.980 --> 31:17.700]  So things are about to start getting very exciting in our garden.
[31:17.700 --> 31:22.220]  Now let's talk about the environment and conditions in our grow room during weeks two and three
[31:22.220 --> 31:24.440]  of the flowering phase.
[31:24.440 --> 31:30.000]  At this stage of flowering, during the day, I try to aim between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit
[31:30.000 --> 31:31.760]  for my daytime temperature.
[31:31.760 --> 31:37.320]  I also aim for 40 to 50% relative humidity for my daytime temperature.
[31:37.320 --> 31:39.880]  Now let's talk about nighttime temperatures.
[31:39.880 --> 31:44.440]  In the nighttime, I like to have my temperature between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
[31:44.440 --> 31:51.160]  I also aim for 40 to 50% humidity during my nighttime cycle at this stage of flowering.
[31:51.160 --> 31:56.080]  Now I want to remind you, try not to have more than a 10 degree temperature difference
[31:56.080 --> 31:58.180]  in your day and nighttime cycle.
[31:58.180 --> 32:01.160]  That is called your diurnal temperature variation.
[32:01.160 --> 32:04.060]  Try to keep that less than 10 degrees.
[32:04.060 --> 32:08.000]  Too much of a drastic swing from day to night temperature will start causing your plants
[32:08.000 --> 32:09.000]  to grow slowly.
[32:09.000 --> 32:10.000]  They will get stagnant.
[32:10.000 --> 32:11.000]  They will slow down.
[32:11.000 --> 32:12.240]  They will not be happy.
[32:12.240 --> 32:15.320]  Also, this will encourage powdery mildew.
[32:15.320 --> 32:20.600]  So let's aim to keep that temperature within 10 degrees from the day and night cycles.
[32:21.040 --> 32:24.080]  Something we should add into our flower room that I've been overlooking on previous episodes
[32:24.080 --> 32:25.760]  is more fans.
[32:25.760 --> 32:26.960]  We need more airflow.
[32:26.960 --> 32:31.680]  As we are entering the flowering stage, we are going to develop big, fat, chunky buds.
[32:31.680 --> 32:35.520]  We need more airflow once we have those buds in the room.
[32:35.520 --> 32:36.920]  We're going to have a lot of moisture.
[32:36.920 --> 32:39.040]  We're going to have big, fat, chunky buds.
[32:39.040 --> 32:42.080]  Those buds will act like a sponge if there is too much moisture.
[32:42.080 --> 32:45.720]  So we need to blow some air around the room and keep that moisture moving.
[32:45.720 --> 32:48.800]  I feel like a little bit of wind and airflow is really good for the plants.
[32:48.800 --> 32:49.800]  It makes them active.
[32:49.800 --> 32:53.320]  It makes them feel like some wind and a little bit of pressure makes the stalks more robust.
[32:53.320 --> 32:56.400]  It makes them want to stand up on their own a little better.
[32:56.400 --> 32:59.920]  Imagine if I shoved you a little bit, you would spread your feet for a little more balance.
[32:59.920 --> 33:03.080]  I think a little bit of wind makes the plants want to spread their feet for a little bit
[33:03.080 --> 33:04.480]  more balance.
[33:04.480 --> 33:07.160]  So add a little bit of wind and airflow to the garden.
[33:07.160 --> 33:08.160]  Don't go crazy.
[33:08.160 --> 33:09.360]  We don't need a wind tunnel in there.
[33:09.360 --> 33:11.080]  We're not trying to dry out the plants.
[33:11.080 --> 33:13.240]  We just want the air moving.
[33:13.240 --> 33:17.240]  If some of your leaves start looking dry and leathery and kind of potato chip-like, they're
[33:17.240 --> 33:19.800]  probably getting beat up by that fan too much.
[33:19.800 --> 33:22.720]  You were ruining the VPD around those leaves.
[33:22.720 --> 33:25.560]  In that condition, just reduce the wind just a little bit.
[33:25.560 --> 33:29.200]  But it's never a bad idea to have some airflow in your grow.
[33:29.200 --> 33:34.000]  If you notice your grow room is consistently too humid, it may be time to invest in a dehumidifier
[33:34.000 --> 33:39.840]  or maybe a larger dehumidifier or possibly add some sort of extraction fan to remove
[33:39.840 --> 33:42.960]  that humid air from the room and replace it with fresh air.
[33:42.960 --> 33:47.160]  If you do add an extraction fan, keep in mind that as the air gets sucked out of the room
[33:47.160 --> 33:51.480]  it is also going to try to draw air into the room through every open opportunity.
[33:51.480 --> 33:54.600]  Most of the time you're going to get air pulled into the room underneath the door.
[33:54.600 --> 33:57.560]  Most of us don't seal the bottom of the door well enough.
[33:57.560 --> 34:01.800]  I feel like that is a great place for fresh air to come in as long as the air coming in
[34:01.800 --> 34:02.980]  is clean.
[34:02.980 --> 34:06.500]  If that air is coming from within your house, it is probably safe.
[34:06.500 --> 34:11.280]  If that crack leads to outside, I would cover that up and find a safer source for the air.
[34:11.280 --> 34:12.960]  That's just going to bring in bugs.
[34:12.960 --> 34:15.140]  It's going to bring in whatever is by that door.
[34:15.140 --> 34:19.380]  If it's powdery mildew, if it's just dirt and dust, it's going to suck all of that right
[34:19.380 --> 34:21.680]  under the door into your grow room.
[34:21.680 --> 34:25.460]  So as soon as you cut a hole for an extraction fan, start thinking about where the air is
[34:25.460 --> 34:28.720]  going to come in when you start blowing that air out.
[34:28.720 --> 34:33.700]  If you cut a hole in a wall and add an extraction fan and blow that air out of the room, it
[34:33.700 --> 34:39.980]  may create a whistling noise underneath the door from all the air flowing underneath that door.
[34:39.980 --> 34:44.760]  If it creates a big whistling noise, you may need to add a passive hole for air to
[34:44.760 --> 34:46.440]  go into the room.
[34:46.440 --> 34:49.600]  This just depends on the size of the extraction fan that you set up.
[34:49.600 --> 34:53.600]  If you put a little four-inch extraction fan, you'll definitely pull enough air under the
[34:53.600 --> 34:54.600]  door.
[34:54.600 --> 34:55.900]  You don't need to make any passive holes.
[34:55.900 --> 34:59.500]  If you go setting up an eight-inch Vortex fan in there and you're just blowing air out
[34:59.500 --> 35:03.500]  of that room, first of all, I recommend a carbon filter on that extraction fan that's
[35:03.500 --> 35:04.500]  going out.
[35:04.500 --> 35:05.500]  You need to filter that air.
[35:05.500 --> 35:10.980]  But also, you may need to make about a four-inch hole to allow air to get into that room somehow.
[35:10.980 --> 35:12.880]  You are sucking all of the air out.
[35:12.880 --> 35:15.240]  You need to allow fresh air in.
[35:15.240 --> 35:19.480]  Cutting holes in walls and adding extraction fans can lead to a lot of problems.
[35:19.480 --> 35:22.680]  Think about this very carefully before you go this route.
[35:22.680 --> 35:26.600]  Also, if you're using CO2, you may want to think about this option because then you're
[35:26.600 --> 35:30.120]  going to fill the room with CO2 and then you're just going to use that exhaust fan to suck
[35:30.120 --> 35:31.720]  the CO2 right out of the room.
[35:31.720 --> 35:35.700]  You're blowing your expensive gas right out the window, literally.
[35:35.700 --> 35:40.480]  I've opened up the conversation for negative pressure versus positive pressure in a grow
[35:40.480 --> 35:44.200]  room environment, but I feel like that is a lesson for the future.
[35:44.200 --> 35:47.840]  I will write a note and we will talk about that in a future episode.
[35:47.840 --> 35:51.280]  Let's get a little bit more on track with this grow lesson and focus.
[35:51.280 --> 35:55.480]  Let's talk a little bit about the nutrients we may need at this phase of the flowering
[35:55.480 --> 35:57.000]  cycle.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.520]  During this part of flowering, we are mainly focusing on a smooth transition from the vegetative
[36:01.520 --> 36:03.860]  stage to the flowering phase.
[36:03.860 --> 36:08.240]  At this point in flowering, we are mainly focusing on a smooth transition from the veg
[36:08.240 --> 36:12.140]  stage to the flowering stage of our plant cycle.
[36:12.140 --> 36:14.920]  Week two is very similar to week one.
[36:14.920 --> 36:17.640]  We will mainly focus on our NPK.
[36:17.640 --> 36:22.680]  We need a low nitrogen, high phosphorus, high potassium diet at this stage.
[36:22.680 --> 36:27.400]  I said earlier, abandon the veg bottle and start using the bloom bottle.
[36:27.400 --> 36:30.060]  Also, we need cow mag at this stage.
[36:30.060 --> 36:33.220]  We also need potassium silicates in my opinion.
[36:33.220 --> 36:35.560]  I also like to add a mycoproduct.
[36:35.560 --> 36:39.060]  Some sort of root product is always good at this stage.
[36:39.060 --> 36:43.460]  Also, enzymes and carbs are great for week two.
[36:43.460 --> 36:47.980]  As we work toward week three, I like to increase my carbohydrates.
[36:47.980 --> 36:50.220]  The plants are getting bud set at this point.
[36:50.220 --> 36:51.900]  They're going to start taking off.
[36:51.900 --> 36:56.100]  I like having some sugars in there to feed the microbes, and then I like having the carbs
[36:56.100 --> 37:01.100]  and the sugars in there to give the plants energy that will encourage rapid growth.
[37:01.100 --> 37:05.420]  At the beginning of week three, I will start increasing my carbohydrate feeding just a
[37:05.420 --> 37:10.220]  little bit, and I will slowly increase that through the flowering phase.
[37:10.220 --> 37:12.100]  We don't need to add a bloom booster yet.
[37:12.100 --> 37:13.840]  We are not quite there yet.
[37:13.840 --> 37:18.860]  Let's just focus on getting these plants through the stretch phase and get the bud sites developed.
[37:18.860 --> 37:24.020]  Then, when we work on the next lesson, we will start adding bloom boosters.
[37:24.020 --> 37:27.820]  Now we are rapidly running out of time for pesticide applications.
[37:27.820 --> 37:33.060]  We need to do a very thorough pest scouting and see what we've got in the grow.
[37:33.060 --> 37:34.060]  We may have thrips.
[37:34.060 --> 37:35.140]  We may have spider mites.
[37:35.140 --> 37:36.300]  We could have fungus gnats.
[37:36.300 --> 37:37.820]  We could have white flies.
[37:37.820 --> 37:41.700]  There could be a myriad of problems popping up at this point in the grow.
[37:41.700 --> 37:45.020]  Let's do an inspection and find out what we're dealing with.
[37:45.020 --> 37:51.020]  If you find any pests, now is one of your last times to apply a sprayed pesticide.
[37:51.020 --> 37:54.500]  I don't like to spray anything after day 14.
[37:54.500 --> 37:59.660]  If you've got an obvious problem, we may extend that just a few days with very specific products,
[37:59.660 --> 38:04.260]  but I really don't like to spray anything past day 14.
[38:04.260 --> 38:05.660]  Let's do a quick scouting.
[38:05.660 --> 38:10.860]  Let's identify any problems we may have, and let's spray before day 14 approaches.
[38:10.860 --> 38:16.700]  At this point, we're at day eight, so we can get two or three solid pesticide spray applications
[38:16.700 --> 38:18.900]  in if they are required.
[38:18.900 --> 38:24.900]  If you don't identify any pests, I may still suggest a preventative spray around day 14
[38:24.900 --> 38:27.500]  just to make sure nothing pops up.
[38:27.500 --> 38:32.420]  Now is the time to get in there and identify pests and work really hard at getting rid
[38:32.420 --> 38:38.420]  of them before we move deeper into the flowering phase and we really limit ourselves on pesticide
[38:38.420 --> 38:40.040]  applications.
[38:40.040 --> 38:43.980]  This is also a good time to start ordering your predator bugs if you're going to use
[38:43.980 --> 38:47.160]  biologicals as your pesticide treatment.
[38:47.160 --> 38:52.480]  If you plan on using biologicals, think about your spray applications and use a strategy
[38:52.480 --> 38:56.560]  that will not cause harm to your beneficials when they do arrive.
[38:56.560 --> 39:01.800]  There are pesticides that you can apply to your plants today and you can release beneficial
[39:01.800 --> 39:04.600]  insects tomorrow and they will work together.
[39:04.600 --> 39:08.240]  If you apply the proper pesticide, you will not kill your beneficials.
[39:08.240 --> 39:13.480]  You will have to do some research on the pesticide and the beneficials and see if they get along.
[39:13.480 --> 39:15.900]  Some of the pesticides are based on pyrethrum.
[39:15.900 --> 39:18.080]  Some of them are based on neem.
[39:18.080 --> 39:21.000]  Some of them are beneficial fungus and bacteria.
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.080]  Those beneficial fungus and bacteria may not kill or disrupt your predator bugs, but it
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.600]  will make the environment uncomfortable for the spider mites because they intend to eat
[39:30.600 --> 39:31.680]  those leaves.
[39:31.680 --> 39:35.900]  The predators are going to eat the spider mites, not the leaves, so they may be able
[39:35.900 --> 39:38.560]  to survive with certain pesticides.
[39:38.560 --> 39:42.600]  It's your responsibility as the grower to do the research on the pesticide you're going
[39:42.600 --> 39:48.120]  to apply and also do research on the predator bugs, which you plan to use in your integrated
[39:48.120 --> 39:53.080]  pest management strategy and find out if they can work together.
[39:53.080 --> 39:58.720]  Some of the newer pesticide and fungicide products actually advertise safe for beneficials
[39:58.720 --> 40:01.160]  or will not harm beneficials.
[40:01.160 --> 40:05.720]  That is saying that they recommend that product in a garden that is also using beneficial
[40:05.720 --> 40:08.520]  insects as a form of pest management.
[40:08.520 --> 40:10.240]  So let's get on top of pest management.
[40:10.240 --> 40:11.240]  Let's do some scouting.
[40:11.240 --> 40:15.120]  If you see anything, now is the time to work on getting rid of that before we get deeper
[40:15.120 --> 40:16.120]  into flower.
[40:16.120 --> 40:19.920]  Now, while you're scouting for pests, that is a great time to keep an eye out for male
[40:19.920 --> 40:21.000]  plants.
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.300]  If you're growing from seed, you've got the opportunity to find males in your garden.
[40:25.300 --> 40:29.040]  You have also got the opportunity to find hermaphrodites in the garden, and you may
[40:29.040 --> 40:32.900]  also find some mutants in your flowering room.
[40:32.900 --> 40:36.200]  The male plants are going to start popping up around day 10.
[40:36.200 --> 40:40.360]  They usually open up and start dropping pollen right around day 14.
[40:40.480 --> 40:44.280]  So we've got a very small window of time to discover these males and get them out of the
[40:44.280 --> 40:47.320]  room before they cause problems.
[40:47.320 --> 40:50.240]  Don't be lazy when it comes to pulling males out of your garden.
[40:50.240 --> 40:53.800]  If you've got a small garden, if you've got a large garden, you need to look at every
[40:53.800 --> 40:57.840]  single plant and pull every single male out of that grow.
[40:57.840 --> 41:01.560]  You also need to pay very close attention for hermaphrodites.
[41:01.560 --> 41:07.000]  When you're checking for males and hermaphrodites on new plants, check in several spots on each
[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  plant.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.200]  Those spots may not reveal hermaphrodite traits.
[41:10.200 --> 41:14.840]  Down lower where you're not getting a lot of light penetration, those plants may show
[41:14.840 --> 41:16.000]  intersex traits.
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.400]  You may get male flowers popping up in your female buds lower on the plant.
[41:20.400 --> 41:23.020]  Pay close attention to the entire plant.
[41:23.020 --> 41:26.840]  I feel like I gave a pretty good description of what a male plant looks like and what a
[41:26.840 --> 41:32.480]  female plant looks like on a previous podcast, but I do encourage you to Google male and
[41:32.480 --> 41:37.320]  female cannabis plants and see what they look like before the time comes.
[41:37.320 --> 41:41.240]  That way, when you've got a boy in the garden, you are sure and you've got confidence and
[41:41.240 --> 41:45.800]  you can remove that male plant from your garden confidently and know you are not going to
[41:45.800 --> 41:47.480]  cause any problems.
[41:47.480 --> 41:51.280]  You want to find the boys before the pollen sacks start opening.
[41:51.280 --> 41:54.680]  Let's talk about what happens if you find a boy and one of those sacks is starting to
[41:54.680 --> 41:55.680]  open.
[41:55.680 --> 41:58.460]  The first thing I would do is spray it with water.
[41:58.460 --> 42:00.240]  Water deactivates pollen.
[42:00.240 --> 42:01.680]  Spray that pollen with water.
[42:01.680 --> 42:03.040]  You'll shut it down.
[42:03.040 --> 42:05.060]  Also spray the girls with water.
[42:05.060 --> 42:08.500]  If you've got clean water around, just spray some water on the plants.
[42:08.500 --> 42:11.020]  Yes, I said we don't want to spray plants that are in flower.
[42:11.020 --> 42:15.060]  I'd rather get them a little bit wet at this point than I would rather get pollen on them.
[42:15.060 --> 42:16.300]  Also, this is just water.
[42:16.300 --> 42:17.660]  There's no pesticide in here.
[42:17.660 --> 42:18.820]  The plants would get hit with rain.
[42:18.820 --> 42:20.380]  They would get hit with dew.
[42:20.380 --> 42:22.180]  This is going to be just fine.
[42:22.180 --> 42:23.180]  Spray them with some water.
[42:23.180 --> 42:24.300]  That will deactivate the pollen.
[42:24.300 --> 42:27.700]  It will also make the plants unable to receive the pollen.
[42:27.700 --> 42:32.380]  At that point, you can either cut down that male plant or you can slide a trash bag right
[42:32.380 --> 42:36.140]  over it like a condom, then cut it, then get it out of the room.
[42:36.140 --> 42:38.140]  Just try not to spread that pollen.
[42:38.140 --> 42:41.540]  I know we've sprayed it with water, but as you bump it around, it's going to open up.
[42:41.540 --> 42:42.860]  More pollen's going to come out.
[42:42.860 --> 42:44.820]  Do your best not to spread that stuff.
[42:44.820 --> 42:46.020]  Hit it with water.
[42:46.020 --> 42:47.420]  Put the trash bag over it.
[42:47.420 --> 42:51.860]  Either take the whole plant, including the dirt, out of the grow or cut it at the base
[42:51.860 --> 42:55.900]  and just get that plant out of there as soon as possible.
[42:55.900 --> 43:00.540]  Leaving a male plant in the grow room for too long will result in a seeded crop.
[43:00.700 --> 43:02.860]  Most of us are aiming for a seedless crop.
[43:02.860 --> 43:05.980]  If you are growing a crop for a commercial reason and you're trying to put it out on
[43:05.980 --> 43:11.660]  the black market, a couple of seeds will ruin the value of your entire crop.
[43:11.660 --> 43:12.660]  Don't be lazy.
[43:12.660 --> 43:13.780]  Keep your eye out for males.
[43:13.780 --> 43:16.300]  Know what males look like and get them out of the garden.
[43:16.300 --> 43:20.460]  Also, keep an eye out for hermaphrodites and get them out of the garden.
[43:20.460 --> 43:25.020]  Once we are past weeks two and three, you cannot get lazy if you're growing from seed.
[43:25.020 --> 43:28.980]  Just because they look like females, you've still got the opportunity for a hermaphrodite
[43:28.980 --> 43:32.280]  to pop up all the way through the flowering cycle.
[43:32.280 --> 43:34.740]  It may not show itself until week nine.
[43:34.740 --> 43:39.620]  It may not show itself until week 10, but you need to see it if it does happen.
[43:39.620 --> 43:43.420]  I've said earlier, if it pops up late in flower, it may not be a big deal.
[43:43.420 --> 43:45.620]  It is too late for the plants to receive pollen.
[43:45.620 --> 43:48.100]  It won't make any seeds that late into flower.
[43:48.100 --> 43:53.020]  Most of the time, if they throw a male flower past week seven or eight, they're usually
[43:53.020 --> 43:58.100]  sterile male flowers that will not contain any pollen, so there's not much to worry about.
[43:58.220 --> 44:03.420]  If you're getting hermaphrodites early in flower, they must be removed from the garden.
[44:03.420 --> 44:05.780]  All right, we've got our environment dialed in.
[44:05.780 --> 44:07.420]  We know what to feed our plants.
[44:07.420 --> 44:08.700]  We are scouting for pests.
[44:08.700 --> 44:11.580]  We have applied our final pesticide application.
[44:11.580 --> 44:13.880]  We have considered releasing predator mites.
[44:13.880 --> 44:16.340]  We know how to look for males and hermaphrodites.
[44:16.340 --> 44:18.060]  We are on the look for trouble.
[44:18.060 --> 44:19.060]  We're looking for bugs.
[44:19.060 --> 44:20.060]  We're looking for males.
[44:20.060 --> 44:21.420]  We're looking for herms.
[44:21.420 --> 44:26.560]  Now, let's talk about a few things we can do to improve the quality of our garden this
[44:26.560 --> 44:28.880]  early in the flowering phase.
[44:28.880 --> 44:33.520]  If you're running a trellis or a scrognet, now is a good time to continue working those
[44:33.520 --> 44:34.820]  buds into the net.
[44:34.820 --> 44:37.200]  You can still work those branches into the net.
[44:37.200 --> 44:41.700]  I would stop doing it probably toward the end of week three, but you've still got time.
[44:41.700 --> 44:45.480]  If you've got a branch that's popping up too high, feel free to give it a little crack,
[44:45.480 --> 44:48.160]  bend it down under the net, and work it into the canopy.
[44:48.160 --> 44:52.240]  We can keep working on a nice, even canopy all the way through the end of week three,
[44:52.240 --> 44:53.760]  so let's keep popping them.
[44:53.760 --> 44:56.120]  Let's keep twisting them and working them into the canopy.
[44:56.680 --> 44:59.240]  Let's talk a little bit about popping and twisting.
[44:59.240 --> 45:02.120]  I've talked a lot about popping and twisting in the beginning of flower.
[45:02.120 --> 45:06.320]  I continue to do this all the way through weeks four and five.
[45:06.320 --> 45:10.320]  I will pop every stem right at the beginning of flower, give it about two weeks to heal
[45:10.320 --> 45:12.440]  up and go back and do it again.
[45:12.440 --> 45:16.400]  Give it about two weeks to heal up and go back and do it again.
[45:16.400 --> 45:20.840]  Grab the base of the stalk, grab it with your other hand, and twist your top hand.
[45:20.840 --> 45:22.800]  As you twist, you'll hear a little pop.
[45:22.800 --> 45:24.720]  That's exactly what you're looking for.
[45:24.720 --> 45:27.040]  As that heals, it will create a knuckle.
[45:27.040 --> 45:29.520]  That knuckle will make a strong spot in the plant.
[45:29.520 --> 45:32.820]  I like to do that to where the entire plant is covered in knuckles.
[45:32.820 --> 45:36.600]  It looks really knurled, and I feel like that that plant is very productive.
[45:36.600 --> 45:39.400]  It's got a nice, thick stalk that can hold a lot of weight.
[45:39.400 --> 45:40.900]  It can hold fat buds.
[45:40.900 --> 45:44.680]  It's also got nice, thick stalks that can move a lot of water, which can carry a lot
[45:44.680 --> 45:45.880]  of nutrients.
[45:45.880 --> 45:51.240]  I feel like it is a very beneficial thing to crack all of the stems.
[45:51.240 --> 45:54.600]  Continue working your plants into the trellis if you're using a trellis.
[45:54.680 --> 45:58.000]  Continue cracking and popping the sticks to make robust plants.
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.600]  I also like to do a bit of lollipopping.
[46:00.600 --> 46:04.960]  If you've got some crappy branches on the bottom of the plant, feel free to remove them.
[46:04.960 --> 46:08.640]  If you've got branches that come off the very bottom of the plant and reach up toward the
[46:08.640 --> 46:14.240]  top, and those top branches, the tops have potential to create good, usable buds, you
[46:14.240 --> 46:19.200]  can clean up the bottom suckers off of that long branch and keep that arm and grow a bud
[46:19.200 --> 46:22.920]  at the end of the arm and take off all that little crap at the bottom of it that you don't
[46:22.920 --> 46:23.920]  need.
[46:24.240 --> 46:29.120]  It's very common to see plants that are three and four feet tall that are completely naked
[46:29.120 --> 46:31.400]  for the first 18 inches of the very bottom.
[46:31.400 --> 46:33.600]  It's just a bunch of sticks coming out of the pot.
[46:33.600 --> 46:34.800]  You don't have any foliage.
[46:34.800 --> 46:36.000]  You don't have any little branches.
[46:36.000 --> 46:41.280]  You don't have any tiny bud sites for 18 inches to maybe even two feet off the ground, depending
[46:41.280 --> 46:46.160]  on the grower's environment and the grower's style and what type of lights they are using.
[46:46.160 --> 46:50.160]  Feel free to get in there and cut out any shitty branches that aren't going to be productive,
[46:50.160 --> 46:53.880]  and feel free to clean up all that stuff real down low on the plant that's not going
[46:53.880 --> 46:55.800]  to get any light.
[46:55.800 --> 46:59.840]  When harvest time comes, we're going to have to trim everything we cut down.
[46:59.840 --> 47:03.680]  If you cut all that little fluffy crap off the plant, you don't have to trim it.
[47:03.680 --> 47:06.640]  Now you're saying, yeah, I could have used that for concentrates or something.
[47:06.640 --> 47:07.640]  Right.
[47:07.640 --> 47:11.200]  If you cut it all off the bottom, we can move that energy right up to the top of the plant.
[47:11.200 --> 47:15.980]  Instead of growing that crappy little fluff at the bottom, we just basically move that
[47:15.980 --> 47:21.380]  up to that top cola to make all those top buds just that much heavier, that much fatter,
[47:21.380 --> 47:23.040]  that much more density.
[47:23.040 --> 47:26.780]  So clean up any crap on the bottom that may be slowing your plants down and move that
[47:26.780 --> 47:28.820]  energy right up to the top.
[47:28.820 --> 47:33.220]  Now another thing I find advantageous is defoliation.
[47:33.220 --> 47:38.480]  There's a lot of debate in the cannabis industry about how to defoliate, what level to defoliate,
[47:38.480 --> 47:40.100]  and when to defoliate.
[47:40.100 --> 47:44.060]  I like to do kind of a hard defoliation right at the start of flower.
[47:44.140 --> 47:48.940]  If there is a large leaf shadowing another branch or shadowing another bud site, I will
[47:48.940 --> 47:51.220]  remove that leaf without question.
[47:51.220 --> 47:55.940]  Then I'll go through the grow and anything with a purple petiole gets removed at the
[47:55.940 --> 47:57.740]  very start of flower.
[47:57.740 --> 48:01.740]  I do this in a commercial environment for several reasons.
[48:01.740 --> 48:05.020]  Removing all of those extra leaves removes opportunity.
[48:05.020 --> 48:09.340]  There are less places for pests to hide and there are less places for pathogens to hang
[48:09.340 --> 48:10.340]  out.
[48:10.340 --> 48:12.100]  So remove the opportunities.
[48:12.140 --> 48:15.260]  Also, it reduces humidity in the room.
[48:15.260 --> 48:19.980]  Without as many leaves doing as much transpiration and respiration, there's a little bit less
[48:19.980 --> 48:24.620]  moisture in the room, so it makes it easier to balance the humidity in the room.
[48:24.620 --> 48:31.540]  I also think a well-timed, well-executed defoliation will increase the vigor of our plants.
[48:31.540 --> 48:34.660]  Now a lot of people will say you don't want to pull off the leaves because that's where
[48:34.660 --> 48:39.180]  the sugars are stored and they're going to use that for nutrients and energy, but we
[48:39.180 --> 48:41.300]  are feeding the shit out of these plants.
[48:41.300 --> 48:43.300]  They don't need to use anything that is stored.
[48:43.300 --> 48:47.500]  We are pouring expensive nutrients into these plants on a daily basis.
[48:47.500 --> 48:50.580]  Don't worry about the stuff stored in those leaves.
[48:50.580 --> 48:53.300]  We're going to replace that right away.
[48:53.300 --> 48:57.380]  Another argument to the defoliation is that those leaves are used as solar panels and
[48:57.380 --> 48:58.620]  they need to be there.
[48:58.620 --> 49:03.380]  Yes, they do, but there is a point where sometimes a leaf is blocking a bud site where if you
[49:03.380 --> 49:08.180]  remove that leaf, it would be more beneficial to put the light closer to the bud than on
[49:08.180 --> 49:09.780]  that big old solar leaf.
[49:09.780 --> 49:12.220]  So selectively remove your leaves.
[49:12.220 --> 49:16.780]  If you're new at defoliating, go in and just tear off a few leaves and see how the plants
[49:16.780 --> 49:17.780]  react.
[49:17.780 --> 49:21.640]  Then the next time, take off a few more and see how the plants react.
[49:21.640 --> 49:24.460]  This will be very strain dependent.
[49:24.460 --> 49:30.180]  Sativa-leaning strains won't react as well as indica-leaning strains will react to heavy
[49:30.180 --> 49:32.260]  defoliation.
[49:32.260 --> 49:36.580]  Another thing I'll recommend is leave those two leaves at the top of the bud.
[49:36.580 --> 49:39.380]  You'll have one bud, your main top sticking up.
[49:39.380 --> 49:42.220]  Then at the top of that, there are two leaves sticking out.
[49:42.220 --> 49:45.340]  When you look in the grow room, you'll see the two leaves I'm talking about.
[49:45.340 --> 49:48.100]  I like to leave those on every plant.
[49:48.100 --> 49:51.780]  Those two mains that are sticking out of the top of the main bud, I like to leave those
[49:51.780 --> 49:53.620]  until late in flower.
[49:53.620 --> 49:59.080]  But quite often, those will be the only large leaves I leave on every plant.
[49:59.080 --> 50:03.260]  So I recommend a semi-heavy defoliation here at the beginning of flower.
[50:03.260 --> 50:08.820]  Then we'll do it again around week four and we'll do it again around week six.
[50:08.820 --> 50:14.000]  Defoliating and cracking and twisting and working into trellis work is kind of an art.
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.540]  You will have to get good at this over time, which will require confidence.
[50:18.540 --> 50:20.280]  So don't be scared.
[50:20.280 --> 50:22.340]  Just get in there and learn how to do it.
[50:22.340 --> 50:24.220]  You are going to make mistakes.
[50:24.220 --> 50:27.860]  I have made countless mistakes in my own grow.
[50:27.860 --> 50:30.020]  I've made mistakes in commercial grows.
[50:30.020 --> 50:32.740]  I have made tiny mistakes and I have made huge mistakes.
[50:32.740 --> 50:33.860]  But you know what?
[50:33.860 --> 50:37.020]  That's how I became a good grower.
[50:37.020 --> 50:38.940]  Experience includes mistakes.
[50:38.940 --> 50:41.440]  Don't be afraid to make mistakes.
[50:41.440 --> 50:44.480]  This is not the last crop you are going to grow.
[50:44.480 --> 50:45.940]  This is a practice crop.
[50:45.940 --> 50:48.460]  The next one will be your pro crop.
[50:48.460 --> 50:52.260]  Don't act like these plants are the last plants you're ever going to get to touch.
[50:52.260 --> 50:53.680]  This is your first time.
[50:53.680 --> 50:55.300]  This is your second time.
[50:55.300 --> 50:56.600]  Have some confidence.
[50:56.600 --> 50:57.780]  Build some confidence.
[50:57.780 --> 51:01.140]  Let's just get in there and break some shit and ruin some shit so that you can see what
[51:01.140 --> 51:02.140]  can go wrong.
[51:02.300 --> 51:04.500]  Then the next grow will be really easy.
[51:04.500 --> 51:06.560]  So don't be afraid to wreck some shit.
[51:06.560 --> 51:08.500]  Don't be afraid to cause some problems.
[51:08.500 --> 51:10.500]  That's how you learn things.
[51:10.500 --> 51:14.700]  If every grow goes smoothly for you, you're going to think growing is easy and you're
[51:14.700 --> 51:16.780]  not going to learn anything.
[51:16.780 --> 51:19.860]  Then your ego is going to get in the way and that's when you're really going to run into
[51:19.860 --> 51:23.340]  problems and then you will have no idea how to solve them.
[51:23.340 --> 51:25.340]  So my point is, don't be scared.
[51:25.340 --> 51:26.860]  Just get in there and play with the plants.
[51:26.860 --> 51:27.860]  You may kill one.
[51:27.860 --> 51:28.900]  You may kill two.
[51:28.900 --> 51:30.980]  But you will learn what they can take.
[51:30.980 --> 51:34.300]  These plants are way more resilient than you would imagine.
[51:34.300 --> 51:38.020]  If this is your first grow, if this is your second grow, you're probably touching those
[51:38.020 --> 51:40.900]  plants like they're delicate little babies.
[51:40.900 --> 51:45.300]  When you see me in a commercial environment, you're going to think I am an abusive ogre
[51:45.300 --> 51:46.620]  to these plants.
[51:46.620 --> 51:50.820]  But then at the end, you will see the highest quality, most beautiful buds come out of these
[51:50.820 --> 51:53.820]  plants that I kind of beat up through their whole life.
[51:53.820 --> 51:55.380]  I really care for the plants.
[51:55.380 --> 51:57.980]  I really have a passion for the garden.
[51:57.980 --> 52:01.460]  Sometimes I'm going really fast and I don't have time for bullshit and I need to get a
[52:01.460 --> 52:04.300]  lot of stuff done in a small amount of time.
[52:04.300 --> 52:08.980]  And sometimes I get a little rough and sometimes it looks like I'm being aggressive and I am.
[52:08.980 --> 52:13.660]  But at the end of the day, the plants show me that they were satisfied with what I did.
[52:13.660 --> 52:16.340]  These plants are used to being outside growing on a hill.
[52:16.340 --> 52:20.500]  These plants are used to being stuck in one place and can't walk away when shit gets weird.
[52:20.500 --> 52:21.540]  They've been in the wind.
[52:21.540 --> 52:22.540]  They've been in the rain.
[52:22.540 --> 52:24.140]  They've been beat up by nature.
[52:24.140 --> 52:26.460]  Some of them probably got peed on by a goat.
[52:26.460 --> 52:31.060]  These plants are amazingly resilient plants and they can take some abuse.
[52:31.060 --> 52:32.220]  So let's abuse them.
[52:32.220 --> 52:34.980]  Let's beat them up a little bit and see what they can take because I think when we push
[52:34.980 --> 52:37.900]  them to their limits, that's when we see their full potential.
[52:37.900 --> 52:40.620]  So don't be afraid to get in there and break some shit, you guys.
[52:40.620 --> 52:43.020]  This is not going to be your last crop.
[52:43.020 --> 52:47.540]  I understand that seeds and clones are very expensive and that this crop means a lot to
[52:47.540 --> 52:48.540]  you.
[52:48.540 --> 52:53.300]  But if you can take one plant and dedicate it to experiments, you can learn a whole lot
[52:53.300 --> 52:57.380]  from that one plant and still produce a very viable crop.
[52:57.380 --> 53:00.740]  So if you're new at defoliating, if you're new at popping and twisting, if you're new
[53:00.740 --> 53:05.660]  at cracking the stems, maybe just pick one plant, defoliate the crap out of one plant
[53:05.660 --> 53:09.260]  and then don't do the others and pay attention to what happens.
[53:09.260 --> 53:13.640]  Something very important to note here, take a lot of notes when you're doing experiments
[53:13.640 --> 53:15.060]  like this.
[53:15.060 --> 53:19.060]  Write down what you did to plant A, write down what you did to plant B, and then take
[53:19.060 --> 53:21.260]  great notes of the outcome.
[53:21.260 --> 53:25.720]  That is a great way to have documentation to find out if the techniques and methods
[53:25.720 --> 53:30.720]  you are using work for your garden and work for you and work for the specific strain which
[53:30.720 --> 53:31.720]  you are growing.
[53:31.720 --> 53:37.380]  I've said it before, but most of us growers are also consumers, which means sometimes
[53:37.380 --> 53:40.040]  we may forget some details.
[53:40.040 --> 53:42.700]  Write some shit down and you will not forget.
[53:42.700 --> 53:47.360]  That way, when the end comes and plant B is way better than plant A, you know exactly
[53:47.360 --> 53:51.600]  what you did to make plant B stand out from the crowd.
[53:51.600 --> 53:56.840]  Then we can repeat that, then we can improve upon that and have a better garden each and
[53:56.840 --> 53:58.520]  every time.
[53:58.520 --> 54:02.880]  Feel free to experiment with one or two plants in the garden until you develop confidence.
[54:02.880 --> 54:06.260]  While you're experimenting, make sure to take notes.
[54:06.260 --> 54:09.880]  The next thing I want to talk about before we start wrapping up the show is bulbs and
[54:09.880 --> 54:11.160]  lighting.
[54:11.160 --> 54:16.160]  As we approach the third week of flower, it is time to remove our metal halide bulb and
[54:16.160 --> 54:19.100]  start using the high-pressure sodium bulb.
[54:19.100 --> 54:24.100]  If you're using an LED, it's time to switch from the blue to the more red spectrum if
[54:24.100 --> 54:25.720]  that is an option.
[54:25.720 --> 54:30.960]  I like to leave my veg bulbs in for the first couple of weeks of flower because I find it
[54:30.960 --> 54:33.360]  helps reduce the stretch.
[54:33.360 --> 54:38.040]  For the first 21 days of flower, our plants are going to take off and stretch extremely
[54:38.040 --> 54:39.040]  fast.
[54:39.040 --> 54:40.480]  They're going to get really tall.
[54:40.480 --> 54:43.040]  Proper nutrients will help reduce the stretch.
[54:43.040 --> 54:46.560]  The right amount of phosphorus and potassium will reduce the stretch.
[54:46.560 --> 54:51.760]  Also, I feel like keeping in the blue light, the metal halide light for the first two weeks
[54:51.760 --> 54:56.840]  of flower will really help keep the plants short and squat and bushy.
[54:56.840 --> 54:59.620]  Now we are approaching the end of the stretch phase.
[54:59.620 --> 55:04.680]  It is time to swap out that blue bulb for the yellow-orange-reddish bulb, which would
[55:04.680 --> 55:06.920]  be the high-pressure sodium.
[55:06.920 --> 55:11.160]  If you have not already changed out your bulb or hit the switch on your LED to change into
[55:11.240 --> 55:16.320]  the flowering mode, now is the time to swap out those bulbs or hit that switch.
[55:16.320 --> 55:22.040]  I wouldn't wait any later than day 21 to change my flowering spectrum.
[55:22.040 --> 55:25.240]  Any later than that, we start hitting a point of diminishing returns.
[55:25.240 --> 55:29.720]  We do reduce the stretch, but we also reduce the bulking when it comes time to develop
[55:29.720 --> 55:30.720]  buds.
[55:30.720 --> 55:31.800]  All right, podcast world.
[55:31.800 --> 55:34.800]  I feel like we are caught up on weeks two and three.
[55:34.800 --> 55:36.160]  We've got our nutrients covered.
[55:36.160 --> 55:37.760]  We've got our environment dialed in.
[55:37.760 --> 55:39.180]  We've added a fan.
[55:39.180 --> 55:41.980]  We've applied our final pesticide applications.
[55:41.980 --> 55:44.660]  We've released our predators if we're going to do so.
[55:44.660 --> 55:46.960]  We're going to continue popping the stems.
[55:46.960 --> 55:50.060]  We're going to continue working the tall plants into the trellis.
[55:50.060 --> 55:52.980]  We're going to keep defoliating as needed.
[55:52.980 --> 55:56.460]  Hopefully you have selected a plant to do some experiments on and you are taking good
[55:56.460 --> 55:57.460]  notes.
[55:57.460 --> 55:59.580]  We are well into the flowering cycle.
[55:59.580 --> 56:05.780]  We do need to continue keeping our eyes open for males and hermaphrodites and mutants,
[56:05.780 --> 56:08.460]  as well as pests and pathogens.
[56:08.460 --> 56:10.500]  Hopefully we haven't made any nutrient mistakes.
[56:10.500 --> 56:12.500]  Hopefully we haven't had any pH issues.
[56:12.500 --> 56:15.100]  If we haven't had any light leaks, we're developing bud set.
[56:15.100 --> 56:18.880]  It looks like dandelions forming on the tips of all of our plants.
[56:18.880 --> 56:20.940]  Hopefully we have removed all of the males from the room.
[56:20.940 --> 56:24.900]  We're still keeping an eye out for males and hermaphrodites and mutants.
[56:24.900 --> 56:29.460]  Now as long as we don't run into any equipment failures or human errors, we are well on our
[56:29.460 --> 56:31.460]  way to a great harvest.
[56:31.460 --> 56:33.140]  All right, podcast world.
[56:33.140 --> 56:38.140]  I feel like that is a great spot to wrap up this lesson on weeks two and three, or days
[56:38.140 --> 56:41.220]  eight through 21 of the flowering phase.
[56:41.220 --> 56:43.620]  I want to thank you for listening to this grow lesson.

[57:37.380 --> 57:39.880]  Podcast world, I am not going to put out an episode on Thursday.
[57:39.880 --> 57:41.180]  It is the holiday season.
[57:41.180 --> 57:43.780]  I plan to spend some time with some friends and some family.
[57:43.780 --> 57:45.140]  I hope you do the same.
[57:45.140 --> 57:47.780]  I'll be back Monday with a fresh new episode.
[57:47.780 --> 57:49.540]  I look forward to joining you then.
[57:49.540 --> 57:52.620]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Mangled Remains.
[57:52.620 --> 57:57.180]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[57:57.180 --> 57:58.340]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[57:58.500 --> 58:01.980]  It's time for episode 383 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[58:01.980 --> 58:05.340]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[58:05.340 --> 58:09.380]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[58:09.380 --> 58:15.060]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[58:15.060 --> 58:18.100]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[58:18.100 --> 58:21.380]  Today I've been taking dabs of Goat Power from Apothecary Farms.
[58:21.380 --> 58:24.420]  I picked this up at their Pueblo medical location.
[58:24.420 --> 58:26.480]  Big shout out to our friends at Apothecary.
[58:26.480 --> 58:35.040]  The potency label on this concentrate says it is 74.8% THC and 86.4% total cannabinoids.
[58:35.040 --> 58:36.200]  This stuff smells delicious.
[58:36.200 --> 58:40.420]  If you have ever smelled or smoked a golden goat, this is exactly what golden goat smells
[58:40.420 --> 58:41.420]  like to me.
[58:41.420 --> 58:45.200]  I'm giving it a fresh smell so I can give you a fair description.
[58:45.200 --> 58:49.680]  It's got a hint of citrus, not overpowering citrus, but it does have a citrus base to
[58:49.680 --> 58:55.600]  it with a tropical pineapple and a juicy fruit gum sort of aroma on top of it.
[58:55.600 --> 58:59.400]  Minus that stickiness that a juicy fruit piece of gum would have.
[58:59.400 --> 59:01.320]  I know it's weird to say something smells sticky.
[59:01.320 --> 59:04.640]  I think that stickiness is part of the flavor and aroma of the gum.
[59:04.640 --> 59:05.640]  It doesn't have that.
[59:05.640 --> 59:07.480]  It's got that tropical sweetness.
[59:07.480 --> 59:08.800]  It's got some citrus.
[59:08.800 --> 59:10.800]  It's got a hint of pineapple.
[59:10.800 --> 59:13.920]  Mostly a citrus and tropical fruit sort of a thing going on.
[59:13.920 --> 59:19.960]  I would really describe it as a orange pineapple tropical fruit Jolly Rancher would probably
[59:19.960 --> 59:23.560]  be the most accurate description that I could nail it down to.
[59:23.560 --> 59:25.280]  So that's the aroma and flavor.
[59:25.960 --> 59:27.680]  It has got a beautiful golden color to it.
[59:27.680 --> 59:31.400]  It's got just the right amount of diamonds, just the right amount of sauce in there.
[59:31.400 --> 59:35.160]  Beautiful, beautiful goat power from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[59:35.160 --> 59:39.020]  And obviously it has got me amped up and ready to talk my face off.
[59:39.020 --> 59:41.520]  So this should be a great podcast.
[59:41.520 --> 59:45.320]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of in-depth grow
[59:45.320 --> 59:46.320]  lessons.
[59:46.320 --> 59:49.920]  In episode 351, we talk about setting a goal for the garden.
[59:49.920 --> 59:52.460]  Then we talk about picking a space for the garden.
[59:52.460 --> 59:56.940]  Then we talk about the appropriate equipment and setting up the grow safely and effectively.
[59:56.940 --> 01:00:00.060]  Then we work our way through getting clones and starting a grow.
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:03.500]  At this point, we're all the way to week four of the grow.
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.500]  In this episode, we're going to talk about weeks four, five, and six.
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:11.900]  If you're a new grower or if you're new to the podcast, I suggest you head back to episode
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.920]  351 and start with the grow lessons there.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.540]  If you are an experienced grower or if you feel like you were up to speed or if you've
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:22.580]  been following along, let's jump right into a grow lesson.
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:28.420]  In this lesson, we are going to focus on episodes four, five, and six of the flowering phase.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:32.060]  At this point of flowering, it should be obvious where the bud sites are going to be.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:33.820]  You should have little buds popping up.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:35.340]  They should look like little dandelions.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.620]  They're starting to actually form into buds by now.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:40.260]  It should be clearly obvious where the buds are.
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:44.220]  It should also be more than obvious which plants are males and females.
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:48.580]  All of the males better be gone by now or you have pollinated everything and you're
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.940]  going to have a seeded crop.
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:53.740]  All of the males are gone at this point.
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:55.980]  At this point, your buds are starting to form.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.880]  You're seeing little pistil, hairy covered buds.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.180]  You're starting to get minimal bud mass at this point.
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:04.940]  We are also coming out of that rapid stretch phase.
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:09.260]  For the first three weeks of flowering, our plants really like to stretch and take off.
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:10.840]  That is pretty much over.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.420]  Our plants are still going to get taller.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:15.060]  Hopefully that top bud grows gigantic.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.000]  That rapid stretch phase is over.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.580]  We don't have to worry so much about the plants just taking off on us anymore.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.020]  They're going to stop stretching and they're going to start focusing their energy more
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:27.100]  on developing the fat, chunky buds we want.
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.460]  At this point, if you don't have a carbon filter, it is really time to get a carbon
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.340]  filter in your grow room.
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:37.820]  If you've got any air exiting the grow, going outside that the neighbors may smell, you
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.980]  need a carbon filter by now.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.620]  Things are going to start getting really aromatic from here on out.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.620]  It is only going to get worse.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.420]  Keep your odor under control.
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:48.420]  I've said it before.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:53.860]  A very common way for your garden to be discovered is for the aroma to be noticed by a neighbor.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:55.260]  The neighbors call the police.
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.540]  The police drive around the block.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.540]  They narrow it down.
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:58.540]  They knock on your door.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.700]  By the time they hit the front porch, they can smell it.
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:01.700]  They know it's you.
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:02.700]  They come knock on the door.
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.740]  If you are in a legal state, they want to count your plants.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:06.740]  It's still a pain in the ass.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.260]  You've got law enforcement in the house, in the grow.
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.260]  It's stressful.
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:14.300]  If you are in a non-legal area, if whoever shows up at your front door feels that they
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.460]  have got probable cause to come into your house, they can come.
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.100]  They can discover your grow.
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.420]  You may be handy with the laws.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:21.460]  You may speak well.
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.980]  You may know how to keep them out of the house for now.
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:27.620]  But if the aroma was strong enough, if their suspicion was strong enough, they're going
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:28.900]  to contact the judge.
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:29.900]  They will have a warrant.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.660]  In several days, they will be back.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.100]  They'll pull off the front door.
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.460]  They will come in armed.
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.820]  It will be scary as shit.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:38.860]  It will destroy your entire garden and ask questions later.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.460]  Now is the time to have a carbon filter.
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:46.620]  Always be thinking about safety and security if you are growing in a legal or non-legal
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:47.780]  state.
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:51.340]  You probably don't even notice how pungent your garden is because you're there every
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:52.340]  day.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:56.300]  But the first time the mailman walks in front of the house and catches a little whiff, he's
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.860]  going to know exactly what that is.
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:03.180]  The first time a little bit of aroma wafts out of your grow and hits your neighbor right
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:08.660]  in her nose, she's going to know exactly what that aroma is immediately.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:13.740]  In this scenario, we are only 4 weeks into flower and our plants are beginning to stink.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.740]  It is only going to get worse.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:19.420]  By week 7, 8, and 9, it is going to be pungent.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:24.100]  As soon as we start harvesting these plants and trimming the plants, that aroma is going
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.540]  to increase exponentially.
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:30.820]  Don't add that extra stress to yourself by stinking up the entire neighborhood with your
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:31.820]  grow.
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:35.540]  I understand that buying a carbon filter and an extraction fan sound like just another
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:39.900]  expense to a new grower, but I would much rather invest that money in a filter and a
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.300]  blower than my lawyer and bail.
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.300]  Alright, I feel like I've made my point.
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.980]  It is time for a carbon filter.
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:50.260]  If you don't have one now, it is time to start taking the steps to get a carbon filter in
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.260]  your garden.
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:55.380]  Alright, I feel like that's a good overview of what's going on in the garden.
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:59.380]  Buds are showing, the stretch phase is over, and it is starting to stink.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:05.360]  Now let's talk about the environment in our grow for weeks 4, 5, and 6.
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.180]  Let's start with temperature.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:12.640]  For a daytime temperature for weeks 4, 5, and 6, I would suggest a range of 70 to 80
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.640]  degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:19.880]  Now if you can dial it in a little tighter, I would like to be between 74 and 77 degrees.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:25.200]  Now during the night, I would suggest a temperature in the range of 60 to 70 degrees.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:30.280]  If you can dial it in nice and tight, I would recommend 65 to 68 degrees.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:35.440]  Again, I'm going to suggest no more than a 10 degree difference in your day and night
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.600]  temperature.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:41.520]  What that means is, if your day temperature is 77 degrees, you don't want your night temperature
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.240]  any lower than 67 degrees.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.660]  We don't want to see any more than a 10 degree diurnal temperature variation.
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:54.220]  If we allow drastic temperature drops in the night cycle, we will slow down the plant growth
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:57.940]  and we will also encourage powdery mildew development.
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.780]  So again, during the day we want to be between 70 and 80 degrees.
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:05.580]  At night, we want to be between 60 and 70 degrees.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:10.860]  Now as time goes on, we are going to want to reduce the temperature of the grow room.
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:14.100]  Later in flower, we want to make the room a little bit cooler.
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:18.260]  So if you are struggling to get the room to 74 at this point, maybe just keep it up there
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:23.620]  at 78, 79 degrees so that when weeks 8 and 9 come around, we can reduce that temperature
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.380]  down to as low as you can get it.
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:30.260]  If the lowest you can get it is 74, let's wait until weeks 8 and 9 to get it there and
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.660]  leave it around 77 now.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.900]  Now I know a lot of people are going to say, why do we want to make it cooler?
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:37.340]  There are several reasons.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:38.940]  Think about a plant outside.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:41.180]  As the seasons change, it gets colder.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.580]  It knows, oh shit, the end of the season is coming.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:44.700]  I need to ripen up.
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.900]  I need to finish.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.860]  So that will encourage the plant to finish.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.100]  It will also encourage beautiful colors.
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:53.700]  It will also encourage more terpene production.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:56.740]  Late in flower, we want to make sure that the temperature of the room is low and light
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:57.740]  breakdown terpenes.
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:01.740]  So why not make it a little bit cooler where we can preserve a little bit more terps.
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:06.540]  I also feel that that little bit of cold toward the end will increase in density.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:09.340]  You will get tighter, more dense buds.
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.740]  It also will help reduce humidity.
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:15.820]  And late in flower, we need a little bit less humidity because we've got those big chunky
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:19.740]  buds and we don't want to develop bud rot in the middle of our flowers.
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.220]  So reducing the temperature in flower has many advantages.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:25.980]  I understand that not all rooms are set up to be able to reduce the temperature late
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:26.980]  in flower.
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.780]  You may be running a perpetual cycle.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:32.220]  You just simply may not have the equipment to get it that cool in flower.
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:33.220]  It is not a requirement.
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.060]  It is just a little bonus.
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:41.100]  It's a little tip and trick that may help increase aroma and color and density and also
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:46.220]  help you avoid powdery mildew and boitritis toward the end of your flowering phase.
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:50.140]  So that is why I suggest reducing the temperature late in flower.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:54.220]  We will talk more about that as we move through these grow lessons.
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:55.940]  Now let's talk about humidity.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:07:01.580]  For weeks four, five, and six, I suggest 40% relative humidity.
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:04.580]  We've reduced the humidity by 10% from last week.
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.560]  We don't need as much moisture in the air.
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.260]  We're starting to develop buds.
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.860]  Those buds act like sponges.
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:14.020]  They will gather all of that moisture in the air, which will lead to boitritis, which is
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:17.780]  our worst nightmare when we get giant buds in a commercial facility.
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:19.620]  So let's reduce the humidity.
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:21.980]  Let's get it down to about 40%.
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:26.940]  Now let's talk a little bit about nutrients for weeks four, five, and six.
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:32.340]  I know I don't give detailed information when I talk about nutrients in these grow lessons.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.460]  That's because I don't know what brand of nutrients you are using.
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:36.980]  I don't know if you're using bottles.
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.960]  I don't know if you're using powder nutrients.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.700]  I don't know if you're running organics.
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:42.860]  I have no idea what you have chosen to do.
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:46.180]  I can't be too specific with the nutrient suggestions.
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:51.340]  What I can do is make sure we cover the bases and I give you a solid foundation.
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:56.580]  So here are the things I would make sure to have in my nutrient mix for weeks four, five,
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:57.820]  and six.
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:01.740]  If you are running bottles, you need a basic bloom nutrient.
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:03.900]  You may have a bottle that says bloom.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:08.280]  You may have a bottle that says bloom A and a bottle that says bloom B. Those bottles
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.860]  are what we need for this stage of flowering.
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:13.820]  You'll notice that those bottles have three numbers printed on them.
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.860]  That is an NPK value.
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:19.020]  At this stage of flowering, we do not need a lot of nitrogen.
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:22.640]  We just need a lot of nitrogen to provide energy to the plants.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.300]  At this stage of flowering, we need more phosphorus and potassium than we have previously needed
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:28.300]  in the grow.
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:33.860]  So you will see a low N number and higher P and K value numbers on your bloom nutrient
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:35.040]  bottles.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.500]  So if you're growing with bottles, hopefully your bloom base has covered your nitrogen,
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.500]  phosphorus, and potassium.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:44.340]  You will also need CalMag at this phase of the game.
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:47.500]  I also recommend enzymes and microbes.
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:51.400]  I would also introduce a kelp product to my feeding regimen.
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:56.240]  I think kelp has a lot of great benefits that we will talk about in a future episode.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.940]  This is also a great time to start introducing a bloom booster.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:02.340]  Again, I don't know what products you're using.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.420]  I don't know what brand you have chosen.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:08.220]  Most bottle nutrients offer a very obvious bloom booster.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:12.260]  Now is the time to start implementing that into your feeding schedule.
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:16.060]  If you really want to provide energy to your plants, you can feed them a carbohydrate product
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:17.560]  at this stage of flowering.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:21.380]  The carbohydrates will give the plants energy and the carbohydrates will also feed your
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.860]  microbes.
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:27.060]  If you are growing with veg bloom powdered nutrients, I would have added Shine by now.
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:30.040]  I definitely would put Shine in there by week three.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:34.380]  Now is basically the time I start tapering off the microbe products and start adding
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:36.460]  in the bloom booster products.
[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:38.900]  The roots should be big and fat and healthy.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:42.500]  By the time the plant is done, I want that plant to be nearly root bound.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.620]  So we are well on our way to filling that pot with roots.
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:50.140]  Now I want to start focusing on moving that energy up top and making big giant buds.
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:54.860]  So through weeks four, five, and six, I start tapering off the microbes and I start increasing
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.220]  the bloom booster product.
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.060]  Now be careful with your bloom boosters.
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:02.900]  A lot of people want to overfeed the bloom booster.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:08.940]  Most bottle nutrient companies have a very clear suggested dose printed on the bottle.
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.960]  Most of the time, that is too much.
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:15.420]  They want you to feed your plants too much so that you have to buy more of their product
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.820]  more frequently.
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:21.740]  I would suggest that a new grower starts off with 50% of the recommended bloom booster
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.200]  dosage.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.040]  The first time you add that bloom booster to your plant feed, only put 50% of the recommended
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.940]  dosage and see how the plants respond.
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:35.520]  If the plants don't show any sign of burn or stunted growth, maybe increase the feeding
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:40.900]  just a little bit next time and increase it until you see the leaf tips just barely burn.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.660]  I like to call it getting their nails done because it starts to look like the end of
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:46.100]  the fingers are just getting their fingernails on there.
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:49.140]  When you see them starting to get their nails done, that's when you know you're pushing
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:51.540]  them to their limit and they're just starting to get burned.
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:55.220]  You can either give them that much again and just keep burning them just a little bit,
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:59.980]  or you can reduce it a little bit, but do not go any harder with the bloom booster once
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:02.740]  you see the fingernails start happening.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:06.460]  Now it sounds natural and feels natural to want to add more bloom booster.
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:08.820]  That's going to give you bigger, fatter buds.
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:12.720]  That's what everybody wants, but there is a point of diminishing returns.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.180]  If you add too much, it will burn the plants.
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:18.260]  Once the plants begin to burn, it will start to lock out nutrients.
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:21.900]  Once they lock out nutrients, it will not take any of your bloom booster, then it all
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:24.940]  becomes a waste of money and you have a shitty harvest.
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:26.340]  So don't be that guy.
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.420]  Don't over bloom boost your plants five or six weeks into flower and completely burn
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:34.380]  them and make them look like shit and ruin your crop when you've only got three weeks
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.380]  to go.
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:40.620]  Now, those are just the basic nutrients I would recommend if you are growing from bottled
[01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:41.620]  nutrients.
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:44.500]  Every company is going to have other products to offer.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.820]  Some companies may offer a silicate product.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:49.360]  Some companies may offer a terpene enhancer.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.420]  Some companies may recommend a bud hardener.
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:55.400]  I'm not sure what company you have chosen, but be careful when adding your additives
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.360]  and just pay attention when mixing.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:03.640]  Make sure that your pH is correct and try to make note of your EC or your PPMs if possible.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.360]  Now if you're growing with organics, if you're growing with super soil, you have probably
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.400]  mixed up your soil at the beginning and there's not a lot you can do to it at this point other
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:16.240]  than adding teas or maybe adding a cover crop or possibly a top dress.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:19.660]  To be quite honest with you, that is not my area of expertise.
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:23.400]  If you're growing organically and you want to boost up your plants a little bit, I would
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.500]  probably suggest a compost tea that included worm castings and it would probably include
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.200]  some sort of guano.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.620]  But again, I am not the organic expert.
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:34.120]  I am not the no till guy.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.680]  I am not a super soil guy.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.880]  I honestly grow in a commercial environment and I grow from bottled and powdered nutrients.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.960]  Most of the advice and guidance that I give you on this show will be based on bottled
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.220]  or powdered nutrients.
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:52.360]  So I feel like that covers the basics of nutrients for weeks four, five, and six.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:57.080]  Basically we want to give them a solid NPK, a little bit of CalMag, some enzymes, some
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.640]  microbes, some carbs.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.920]  I would introduce kelp.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.940]  I would introduce a bloom booster.
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:05.840]  And basically at this point I would start reducing the microbe products and I would
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:10.480]  start replacing the microbes with a bloom booster product over the next couple of weeks.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.480]  All right.
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.000]  Now I feel like we know what type of environment to keep these plants in.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.720]  I feel like we know how to feed them.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.320]  We know what's going on in the grow.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.920]  Now what can we do to these plants to increase production?
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.920]  What can we do to make sure they stay healthy and pest free all the way up to the end of
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.720]  the flowering cycle?
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:33.000]  One thing we need to keep in mind is that we need to be very selective on sprays this
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.440]  late in flower.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:39.800]  I would prefer not to spray anything at all on these plants, but if we do run into issues,
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:45.480]  there are very limited options of products we can use to spray on these plants.
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.680]  So let's do our best at this point to keep bugs out of the grow room.
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:54.680]  We should already be implementing an integrated pest management system, which includes a spray
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:58.400]  rotation and possible release of predator bugs.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.000]  I would also avoid going to other gardens.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.240]  If you have friends that grow, I would stay away from their grow.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.840]  I would also never take anybody else into my grow, especially other friends that grow.
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:13.380]  You are inviting their spider mites right into your garden.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:16.180]  Also change clothes if you go to another grow.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:19.940]  If you work in a commercial grow and have a private grow at home, change clothes between
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:21.020]  those grows.
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:25.660]  I would also recommend changing clothes between stops at the grow store and going to your
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:26.660]  garden.
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:29.260]  Don't go straight from the hydro shop to your garden.
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:32.020]  You're picking shit up at the grow store all day long.
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:34.020]  All of the dirty growers are going there.
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.900]  All of the soil is being shipped there.
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:38.580]  That is a hotbed for pests.
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:41.780]  Don't take your pests from the grow store right to your garden.
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:46.980]  I would also recommend a dedicated pair of shoes for the garden or for the grow room.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:51.660]  If you work in multiple facilities, I would have a pair of shoes for the grow at work.
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:53.860]  I would have a pair of shoes that I wore after work.
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:58.220]  Then I would have a different pair of shoes that I put on to go in my personal garden.
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:04.020]  Also, if you have an outdoor grow and an indoor grow, change clothes and shoes between those
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:05.460]  gardens.
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:10.260]  It sounds really tedious and it sounds like overkill, but we do not want to spread spider
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.700]  mites from one garden to another.
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:18.020]  The most obvious and easy way for mites to spread is for them to travel on a grower.
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:22.900]  So let's do our best as responsible growers, as responsible farmers to not spread spider
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:26.540]  mites to our other grows and to our friends grows.
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:30.900]  It's pretty easy to get rid of spider mites early in flower and veg, but it is a pain
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.660]  in the ass to get rid of spider mites late in bloom.
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:36.180]  So let's not drag them into the bloom room.
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:40.460]  If you do have multiple rooms or multiple facilities and you do find a pest issue in
[01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:45.100]  one area, treat that area as a contaminated space.
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:48.780]  Notify everybody that works there, hey, there are spider mites in here.
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:51.420]  Don't go in here unless it is required.
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:55.880]  Then if you do have to go in that area, make sure you change clothes before entering another
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:00.140]  grow area and carrying those spider mites throughout the facility with you.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:04.300]  If you have one room that is not infested with mites and you have another room that
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:09.100]  is infested with mites, work on the clean room first when you get to work, do all the
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:12.420]  work that needs to be done in there, close that room up and be done.
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:15.340]  Then go to that spider mite room, do your work in there.
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:19.700]  And then when you're done, leave the grow facility, remove your clothes, clean them,
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:24.660]  put them in the laundry and don't take those dirty clothes back into that clean room.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:28.860]  Work on the clean room first, then work on the dirty rooms last so that we don't drag
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:32.060]  those spider mites into the room that is clean.
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:36.580]  And if you know that one room is contaminated and you have to go in there, I would almost
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:41.260]  suggest a lab coat or a Tyvek suit that you can swap between rooms.
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:45.460]  If you've got to go into the mited room, throw on the lab coat, throw on the Tyvek suit,
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:49.420]  go into the spider mited room, do what you need to do, come out of that room, remove
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:54.560]  the lab coat or Tyvek suit, replace it with a fresh lab coat or Tyvek suit, and then go
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:57.020]  into the room that you need to work in next.
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:58.820]  Again, I know this sounds tedious.
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:03.900]  I know this sounds like overkill, but imagine if you've got 500 plants in one room and you're
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:08.220]  expecting to harvest over a hundred pounds and we just dragged spider mites into there
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:09.420]  from the other room.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:12.820]  Now we've got one room that is almost ready to harvest and we've been fighting spider
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:14.300]  mites, it's almost gone.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.580]  We're almost through that battle.
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:16.580]  But guess what?
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:20.240]  You just walked into the other room and we're five weeks into flower and you just dropped
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:23.940]  a spider mite bomb in there because you were lazy and didn't bother to change your lab
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:25.140]  coat.
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:28.320]  Small problems are small problems when they are small problems.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:33.580]  But when we go to a large scale cultivation facility, a very small problem will multiply
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:34.780]  overnight.
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:38.760]  Those spider mites are going to have a party when we turn off the lights and everybody
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:39.760]  goes home.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:43.420]  You will come in the next morning and now it is spider mite world.
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:47.900]  So let's do our best to not introduce spider mites to the grow because we are very limited
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:51.340]  on plans of attack to get rid of those mites in this point of the game.
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:54.060]  There are very limited sprays we can apply.
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:58.020]  One thing we can do, we can release predator bugs.
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:02.660]  Now if you were planning ahead, part of your integrated pest management system did include
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:06.900]  ordering predator bugs to be released early in flower.
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:10.760]  Hopefully around week three, you released an army of predator bugs.
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:15.180]  So now if any spider mites do show up, those predators are already colonized.
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:19.540]  They're already there claiming their turf and no spider mites will start infesting your
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:20.540]  grow.
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:24.540]  Now if you didn't get those predator bugs in there early, it is not too late to order
[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:29.260]  predators to come attack your spider mite infestation, but you need to act quickly.
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:31.100]  Don't say I'll order them Monday.
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:35.860]  When you see spider mites in the grow, order those predator mites today.
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:39.760]  When that box of predator mites comes, you need to stop what you were doing and release
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:42.580]  those bugs into the garden immediately.
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.140]  We need to win the war.
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:48.420]  We need to release our troops to get in there and destroy those spider mites that are sucking
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:50.020]  the juices out of our plants.
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:53.540]  They are destroying our potency and they are diminishing our yields.
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:56.060]  We need to get rid of them immediately.
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:00.420]  So if it's too late to spray, I highly suggest you order predator bugs.
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:02.440]  Order more than you think you need.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:08.140]  We want a large army to get in there and wipe out the infestation as quickly as possible.
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:12.260]  Now earlier I did say we are very limited on the products we can spray to our plants
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:13.260]  this late in flower.
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:18.360]  There are a few beneficial fungus based products that can be applied to the plants this late
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:21.120]  in flower that will not affect the taste.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:26.840]  If you understand the products you are using, you can apply a sprayed pesticide and you
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:29.720]  can release predators and they will work together.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:35.320]  The proper pesticide at this stage of the game will not harm your flowers and it will
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.920]  not kill your predators.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:41.440]  Again, I do not suggest spraying plants with bulky flowers.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.980]  But sometimes something has to be done.
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:47.520]  We do have a few spray application options.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.760]  Do not spray anything oil based this late in flower.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:56.000]  It will ruin the flavor and aroma of your plants.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  The only things I would recommend to spray this late in flower would be beneficial fungus
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000]  type products.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.280]  I would never apply an oil this late in flower and I don't even want to spray them unless
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.680]  it is absolutely necessary.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.980]  I would rather release the predators and let them do their thing.
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:17.800]  But I understand sometimes you are going to go into panic mode.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:20.480]  Sometimes it is more than what the predators can handle.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:23.920]  Sometimes you may have already purchased a pesticide and you don't have funding to order
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:24.920]  insects.
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:29.840]  I do understand that things come up in a garden and life does happen and we can't always control
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:30.880]  things.
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:34.240]  One thing we can do from this situation is take note.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:39.140]  We can try to understand how did we get spider mites and how can we prevent this from happening
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:40.400]  next time.
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.700]  So it is time to stop spraying the plants.
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:46.820]  It is also time to stop running the sulfur burner.
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:49.900]  If you've got a sulfur burner in your grow, turn that shit off.
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.540]  It is making your plants taste terrible.
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:55.020]  It is making your concentrates taste terrible.
[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:59.700]  Let's stop using sulfur burners in the grow and let's start correcting the true issue.
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:01.420]  What is causing the powdery mildew?
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:04.580]  People use sulfur to prevent and cure powdery mildew.
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:06.580]  How about we find the cause?
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:10.620]  Instead of burning sulfur in the room and making the room smell like shit, making your
[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:14.820]  buds smell like shit, making your concentrates smell like shit, making the final product
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:16.700]  completely taste like shit.
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:20.900]  Let's find out what's causing that powdery mildew and cure that instead of just burning
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:22.580]  sulfur in the room.
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:26.260]  Now I know a lot of people have a sulfur burner and that is their method.
[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:27.260]  That's how they learn.
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.620]  That's what they're going to do.
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:31.240]  They're not going to stop doing it because I said so.
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:32.340]  Let's compromise.
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:36.980]  If you insist on using a sulfur burner in your garden, perhaps you can stop using it
[01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:41.340]  around week three or around week four when those buds start popping up.
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:44.800]  Earlier in the episode, I suggested reducing humidity.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:48.900]  Perhaps reducing that humidity a little bit will help prevent that powdery mildew.
[01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:52.320]  Since we're getting the fat buds, we need to reduce humidity anyway.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:57.100]  Let's get it a little cooler, reduce humidity and stop burning that sulfur and I'm sure
[01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:58.800]  the product will taste better.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:03.660]  If you've ever smoked a concentrate that tasted like fish or fish oil, a lot of the times
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:08.300]  that is because there was a sulfur burner being used in the room during the flowering
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:09.620]  phase.
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:14.420]  No more sprays and no more sulfur burners after week three, please.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:18.900]  So now that we are approaching week four, it is time to reduce some of the physical
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:21.500]  stress we have been performing to the plants.
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:26.260]  I still want to do some popping and twisting and I still want to work them into the net,
[01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:30.060]  but I don't want to go as hard and as extreme as I was before.
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:34.380]  I want to allow these plants to use their energy on producing buds now and not recovering
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:37.220]  from all the popping and breaking and not being stressed out.
[01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:41.380]  I want them to just focus on making fat, chunky buds and sweet trichomes for me.
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:44.020]  So I'm going to reduce the stress a little bit.
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:47.620]  That doesn't mean I'm going to stop beating them up, but I am going to mellow out just
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:49.380]  a little bit on these girls.
[01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:50.940]  So we're going to reduce the stress.
[01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:54.660]  We're going to do a little less popping and twisting, but we are still going to pop and
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:56.120]  twist the stems.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.140]  We're also going to continue working these plants into the trellis.
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:02.220]  So if you've got a trellis net and you've got a plant that's taken off, getting too
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:06.500]  tall, don't be afraid to grab that one, crack the stem and work it right back under the
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:07.500]  net.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:11.860]  The start of week four is also a good time to do our final bottoming.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:15.080]  We've got those little bud sets showing, we know where the buds are going to be.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:18.820]  If you've got a stick with a bunch of little tiny shitty buds on it, just clean those little
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:22.620]  popcorn balls right on off and leave that stuff at the end of the branch to develop
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:24.740]  into a nice chunky bud.
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:28.940]  In a previous episode, I talked about taking off all those little tiny sucker buds.
[01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:32.620]  You can leave the thick branches, but those little buds that grow off the base of that
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:35.380]  branch toward the bottom, those can get cut off.
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:38.920]  If they're just a waste of space and energy and they're not going to produce anything
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:42.820]  except a pain in the ass, you can cut those right off of the plant.
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.980]  Some growers like to say, that's what I was going to make concentrate out of.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:48.120]  That's what I was going to make my edibles out of.
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.780]  That's fine if you want to leave that there.
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:53.700]  I feel like if you cut that stuff off that doesn't get a lot of light, you take that
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:56.660]  energy and you move it right up to the top of the plant.
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:24:00.300]  Instead of the plant feeding those 12 little tiny shit buds at the bottom, it can just
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:03.020]  put that energy right up at the top where it's getting light.
[01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:07.380]  It can use that energy to make that top cola that much beefier, that much fatter.
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:09.300]  It also sucks to trim that bottom stuff.
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:11.460]  Nobody wants to trim those little popcorn buds.
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:13.660]  Nobody wants to waste time cutting that off.
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:17.180]  If you can cut something off to make something better, why wouldn't you do it?
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:19.960]  Now is a good time to go do a final bottoming.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:25.180]  Just clean up that messy crap on the bottom that's not going to turn into any usable bud.
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:29.220]  I also like to do a light defoliation at this point.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:34.260]  Any leaf with a purple petiole will get taken off at this point in time.
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:38.180]  If you've got a big leaf, it's got a purple stem, you can see that long purple stem, just
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:39.300]  go ahead and break that off.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:43.100]  Break that stem off as close to the branch, as close to the bud as you can so you don't
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.180]  leave that little stem there with moisture hanging out.
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:46.980]  Just break that stem right off.
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:48.500]  Get those leaves out of the room.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.260]  We don't need all the excessive leaves.
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:53.740]  Anything with the purple stem, I'll go kind of light.
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:54.740]  I'll do one layer.
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:55.740]  I'll look at the room.
[01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:56.740]  I'll say, yeah, I could do more.
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:58.620]  Then I'll go back and take off more leaves.
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:00.660]  Then I'll stand back and look into the room.
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:04.340]  I just try to make sure that I've gotten all the giant leaves that are blocking the light
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:06.340]  from hitting the buds.
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:10.340]  If I can see light coming down and it's hitting a leaf, and I can clearly see that that leaf
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:15.420]  is hanging over a bud site, I will remove that leaf so that bud site can get the light.
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:18.980]  Now a lot of old school growers are going to tell you don't remove the leaves because
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:21.580]  that's where the nutrients and sugars are stored.
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:25.540]  I'm pretty sure earlier in this episode, we talked about feeding these plants a whole
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:27.220]  bunch of nutrients.
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:29.980]  There's not really a reason for these plants to store nutrients.
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:31.460]  We are feeding the shit out of them.
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.900]  These are high performance plants that are going to get a high performance meal every
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:35.900]  day.
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:37.220]  They don't need that stored stuff.
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:39.060]  We can pull those leaves off.
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:42.540]  Those leaves will give us opportunity for powdery mildew.
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:45.420]  Those leaves are places for pests to hide.
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:48.040]  Those leaves have to come off when we trim anyway.
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:51.460]  Why not take those leaves off now and save us the trouble?
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:54.100]  Don't go extreme and make the plants naked.
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:58.020]  Take off the leaves with the giant petioles and the leaves that are in the way.
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:00.100]  This is kind of intimidating for new growers.
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:04.300]  And honestly, this is an art and a skill that you will have to develop over time.
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:08.740]  A good way to practice defoliating and seeing what happens to the plants is to get four
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.020]  plants of the same thing.
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.500]  So you've got four clones of, let's say, golden go.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.220]  You got four golden go plants.
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:15.300]  They're all in the same room.
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:16.940]  They're all in the same environment.
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:20.180]  Why not defoliate one really hard?
[01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:22.180]  Defoliate one kind of hard.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:25.860]  Defoliate one a little bit and then don't defoliate the other one at all.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.500]  Then take pictures if you can.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:29.460]  Then take as many notes as you can.
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:34.100]  And then keep an eye on those notes and pictures and see which plant came out the best.
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:36.460]  Did the plant that you left alone come out the best?
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:39.900]  Did the plant that we beat to shit and almost made it naked come out the best?
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:41.900]  Or was it the one that's right in the middle?
[01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:47.000]  It's going to be strain specific on how hard you want to go with defoliation.
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:53.560]  Most strains will benefit from a medium defoliation and they will definitely benefit from removing
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:57.520]  all those super large leaves that are blocking your bud sites.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:01.800]  Now if you go too hard, your plants will look naked and the growth will stop.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.280]  You'll just slow them down.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:07.360]  So don't go extremely hard on your first defoliation.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.360]  Kind of practice.
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.360]  Go in there and pull off some leaves.
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.940]  I like to say this in the podcast all the time.
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:15.720]  You can take more off, but you can never glue those leaves back on.
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.720]  So pull a few off, take a step back, look at it, see what you think.
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:22.440]  If you want to take off more, get in there and take them off.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.720]  If you're intimidated by it, leave the leaves there.
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:30.200]  One thing I will suggest is that if a leaf is yellow or funky, you remove it.
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.600]  Don't hesitate and don't be shy to take down the ugly leaves.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:34.920]  Those need to go.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:38.240]  Those yellow leaves are invitations for pests.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:43.080]  A spider mite will see a yellow leaf and they will head right to that leaf because it is weak.
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:47.080]  The outer layer isn't as thick and crunchy, so that spider mite can get its shitty little
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:51.240]  fangs right through that skin and it can get right in there and start sucking the juice.
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:54.240]  It doesn't have to deal with that thick, healthy plant flesh.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:00.040]  So get rid of those yellow leaves and remove them from the garden as soon as possible.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:04.000]  Something else I would suggest at this point in flowering is to increase airflow.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.360]  It may be a good time to add some fans to the room.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:09.640]  If you don't have an oscillating fan in the room, now is the time.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:11.760]  We want those leaves rustling.
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:17.400]  We don't want those buds sitting still and letting stagnant air build up in those buds.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:21.240]  We don't want the plants being bent over and getting shit whipped by the fan all day.
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:24.040]  We just want every leaf to rustle occasionally.
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:27.760]  You just want that fan to pass by and just give those leaves just a little rustle.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.160]  Just move the air around.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:32.120]  Just stir the air so that nothing can get still.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.120]  Just move that air.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:38.080]  I just keep doing this motion with my hand like you guys can see me just moving that air.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:41.000]  But like I said earlier, our buds are going to start developing.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.280]  They're going to start getting fat and chunky.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.800]  Those buds work like sponges.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:48.880]  If there's too much moisture in the air, that moisture will get trapped inside those buds.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.480]  Then we'll start getting bud mold inside the bud.
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:56.400]  If you've got a fan, moving that air and moisture around, that will reduce the opportunities
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.000]  for bud mold.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.680]  Now that you're adding fans, you may need to add some sticks or some sort of cages for
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:03.680]  supports.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.880]  If you're not using a trellis net, your buds are going to start toppling over.
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:12.040]  Let's not wait until weeks five and six when those buds are big and chunky and sticky and
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.520]  they're falling over trying to break the sticks.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:15.680]  Let's get some stakes.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.280]  Let's get some tomato cages.
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:19.560]  Let's start supporting these plants early.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:23.080]  If you've got a big long branch and you can tell that it's going to turn into a giant
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:26.020]  bud, go ahead and stick a long stake into the pot.
[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:27.020]  Stick it into the soil.
[01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:29.000]  Try not to cut up too many of the roots.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.880]  It's going to happen, I understand.
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.080]  But shove that stake straight into the soil.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.440]  Get that stick straight up sticking where you need it.
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:41.600]  Then use a twisty tie or a zip tie or something gentle to just gently attach that topply stick
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:42.600]  to that branch.
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.280]  You don't want to squeeze that branch at all.
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.300]  It needs to be loose so that you don't pinch that branch.
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:51.000]  You want some freedom in there, but you don't want it flopping around too much.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.040]  Don't pinch or crush or squeeze the branch at all.
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.440]  Be very gentle.
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:58.800]  So use a few stakes and stick them in the dirt and have them sticking straight up and
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:02.280]  attach those floppy branches to those stakes as needed.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.280]  Don't be shy.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:06.500]  I've seen people use a shit ton of stakes in each pot.
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:11.100]  If that's what you've got to do, that's what you've got to do to keep that plant upright.
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:16.140]  So get some sticks or get some tomato cages and be prepared to start supporting your plants.
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:20.300]  I hope your buds get so chunky that those plants just want to fall right over.
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:21.600]  That's what I hope for you.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:25.820]  But I also hope you've got some sticks or a tomato cage on hand so that those plants
[01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:28.620]  don't die when that shit starts happening.
[01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:29.740]  So we've got some airflow.
[01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:31.620]  We've got some sticks in our plants.
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:36.800]  Another thing we need to focus on is to continue scouting for pests and PM.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:41.120]  Just because we're this late in flower doesn't mean that problems can't arise.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:45.360]  Keep your eyes open for pests and powdery mildew and boetritis.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:50.480]  Now while we're scouting for pests and boetritis, we also need to pay attention to plant problems.
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:51.840]  Do you see any nutrient burn?
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.720]  Do you see any pH issues?
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.400]  Pay attention to the leaves.
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.160]  A few crunchy leaves here and there, that's acceptable.
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:00.960]  A few shitty leaves low in the canopy, that's acceptable.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:05.460]  If you start getting large clusters of shitty looking leaves, you've got a problem that
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.320]  needs to be addressed.
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:10.260]  Hopefully you are taking notes of what you've been feeding the plants.
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:13.900]  Hopefully you've got some kind of record of what the pH was that was going into the plants.
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:17.620]  And maybe you've even been taking notes of what is coming out of the plant.
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:20.820]  Have you been measuring the EC and pH of your runoff?
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:26.080]  If so, that will help you diagnose problems if a problem should arise.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:30.180]  Now while you're scouting for pests and while you're looking for nutrient issues, also don't
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:32.960]  forget about all of the equipment in the grow room.
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:36.080]  Just do some visual inspections while you're walking through the room.
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:39.220]  Listen, look, you may notice things.
[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:44.000]  Always be paying attention to the plants and the equipment while you're in the grow.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.080]  Now while you're looking around for equipment problems, you're looking around for pests,
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:53.960]  and we're also looking around for yellow leaves, we still need to keep our eyes out for hermaphrodites.
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:58.980]  If you are growing from seed, it is still an opportunity to reveal hermaphroditic traits
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:00.400]  this far into flower.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.400]  So keep your eyes out for hermflowers.
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:06.900]  And I think we've talked a little bit in a previous episode about what to do if you do
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:10.360]  discover a hermaphroditic plant this late into flower.
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:11.840]  You've got several options.
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:15.740]  You can pull out the flowers, you can cut off the main bud that's got the male flowers
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:20.600]  on it, you can cut down the whole plant, or you can choose to ignore the immediate threat
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:24.840]  and you can keep an eye on that male flower and see if it opens and drops pollen.
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:29.240]  Just keep in mind that if you do see male flowers, you do run the risk of having pollen
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:30.760]  in that grow room.
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:35.800]  And at this point of flowering, those female plants are really eager to receive that pollen
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.400]  and create seeds.
[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:41.460]  So keep your eye open because it is not too late to find hermaphrodites.
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:43.000]  In fact, that is always the case.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.820]  Keep your eyes open through the entire grow on your first or second run with the new cultivar
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:49.480]  or if you're growing from seed.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:53.260]  All right, podcast world, this episode is starting to get long, so let's start recapping
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:55.580]  and start wrapping up the episode.
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:56.700]  Let's recap week four.
[01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:00.040]  In week four, we are going to continue working the plants into the nets.
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:02.500]  We're going to continue popping and twisting.
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.500]  We're going to bottom the plants a little more.
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:07.800]  And now is the time to put on sticks or tomato cages.
[01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:12.080]  We need to reduce the stress of the plants and start letting the buds develop, but we
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:16.940]  still need to work the plants and pop the stems and defoliate a little bit.
[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:18.760]  Then we'll work into week five.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.020]  That is when we're going to do our final bottoming.
[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:23.980]  We need to finish bottoming the plants by the end of week five.
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:26.060]  We will do our final popping and twisting.
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:29.720]  Then we're going to let the plants just settle in and develop buds.
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:32.160]  We will do our final major defoliation.
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:36.420]  We will continue to lightly defoliate through harvest, but this is the last big defoliation
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:37.420]  we will do.
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:40.100]  We will also pull all of the shitty leaves.
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:42.100]  We'll take off all the small popcorn buds.
[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:45.940]  Any branches that don't look like they're worth a shit will get taken out at this time.
[01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:48.600]  Now is the last chance to get supports on these buds.
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:52.720]  If you don't have some sticks or some tomato cages in there now, by week five, you are
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:53.780]  going to see problems.
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:56.560]  In week six, your plants are going to start toppling over.
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:59.640]  Now is the time to get in there and make sure you've got sticks and some sort of twisty
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:02.800]  tie or something like that holding your buds up.
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.400]  It is also time to increase airflow.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:07.360]  We are going to start getting chunky buds.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.840]  If you don't have the airflow moving, now is the time to do it.
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:13.120]  We also need a carbon filter in week four.
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.620]  I forgot to recap that.
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:15.760]  We need that carbon filter.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.320]  I feel like I covered that very well.
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:21.180]  In week six, we are going to need that airflow.
[01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:23.480]  You better have those sticks and supports done.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:24.680]  We are done bottoming.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:26.000]  We are done working.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  We are done cracking, popping, and twisting these plants.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.760]  It is time to let them grow and let the buds get fat.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.860]  Stay on top of scouting for problems.
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:36.040]  We need to look for bugs.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.880]  We need to look for powdery mildew.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:40.140]  We need to look for hermaphrodites.
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:45.080]  We also need to pay attention to environmental, nutrient, or pH stresses.
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:49.400]  If we see anything caused by those things, we need to adjust accordingly.
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:53.800]  My favorite part about weeks five and six, this is when the good photos happen.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.240]  Those buds are starting to get chunky.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.080]  The buds are nice and fluffy.
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:59.360]  All of the pistils are still nice and white.
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.600]  All of the leaves are still lush and green.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.640]  Now is a great time to start taking photos.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:07.160]  That is my favorite part of week six.
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.680]  In week four, you got little nugs.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:11.000]  You got those little popcorn balls developing.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.220]  Then in week five, you're starting to get actual buds.
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:14.880]  You can see the buds growing up the stick.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:16.320]  They're starting to get chunky.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:20.840]  Then in week six, you actually start developing photogenic colas.
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.440]  It's time to get in there and start taking pictures.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.640]  You're seeing some beef.
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:24.920]  You're starting to get some good colors.
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.440]  The trichomes are coming in.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:30.280]  Week six is when it really starts getting exciting.
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:35.400]  Now the thing to think about is keeping these plants healthy, pest-free, problem-free, all
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:36.800]  the way until the end.
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.440]  Keep yourself out of trouble.
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:39.440]  Don't brag.
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.960]  Don't start posting photos just yet.
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:45.960]  If you do take a sweet-ass photo in week six, I suggest you save it until harvest.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:48.480]  Then start flooding the pictures out after harvest.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:51.360]  That way, nobody knows when you're cutting down your crop.
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:54.480]  That's just kind of a weed grower trick from back in the day.
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:58.080]  Another thing to start thinking about is, is the next run ready?
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:02.440]  We're going to harvest these plants in two to four weeks, depending on your strain.
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.900]  Do you have plants lined up for the next run?
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:07.300]  Do you have clones that are getting rooted?
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:08.580]  Have you ordered seeds?
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:10.520]  Are you prepared for the next run?
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:14.480]  We don't want to miss any time, so let's get on top of the next run.
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:16.860]  That feels like a great opportunity to pitch my seed vendor.
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:20.760]  If you need some seeds, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and you can find
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:25.200]  them at www.dankseed.store.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:29.780]  All right, podcast world, I feel like that is a great place to wrap up this episode.

[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:38.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is all I've got for you this week.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:41.020]  I'll be back Thursday with another Mike episode.
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:43.700]  Then I'll be back Monday with another grow lesson.
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:47.460]  We will focus on week seven through nine of flowering our plants.
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:49.260]  I want to thank you guys again for listening to the podcast.
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:52.660]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend James Butterson.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:56.260]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:58.220]  Hey, what's up everybody?
[01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:01.700]  It's time for episode 385 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:04.540]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:08.620]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:14.460]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:17.700]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:23.420]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Goat Power Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:25.280]  This smells just like golden goat.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:30.200]  It tastes just like golden goat and it has got that sativa punch that golden goat brings.
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.200]  I love it.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:34.360]  I've always been a big fan of golden goat, so this is a delicious concentrate.
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:41.280]  The label says it is 74.8% THC with a total of 86.4% total cannabinoids.
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:42.800]  I really like smoking the goat power.
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:45.840]  It gets my brain fired up and it tastes amazing.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.880]  That is a quality concentrate.
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:50.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be another grow lesson.
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:54.400]  If you've been following along, you know I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:57.560]  In this lesson, we are going to do week seven through nine.
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.000]  We are wrapping up the grow.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.400]  It's almost time to harvest, so we're going to talk about the final weeks of flowering.
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.560]  We'll work our way into flushing and a little bit of defoliation.
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:10.120]  If you haven't been following along, I recommend you go back to episode 351 and start listening
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:11.320]  to the grow lessons.
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:15.000]  If you are an experienced grower or if you've been following along or if you feel like you
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.460]  were up to speed, let's jump right into this grow lesson.
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:24.320]  At this stage of the flowering cycle, we are entering what I call the third trimester.
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:27.880]  Most of our plants are going to take between eight and 10 weeks to flower.
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:31.720]  I think nine weeks is a good template to set up these grow lessons.
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:37.000]  If your plants are going to take more than nine weeks, I suggest you extend my advice
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.460]  for week seven one more week.
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:43.480]  Just repeat the week seven feeding, the temperature, the humidity.
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:47.920]  Just repeat week seven one more time if you've got a longer flowering cultivar.
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.240]  Now I understand if you're growing from seed, you may not know how long your plants are
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:52.720]  going to take to flower.
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:55.000]  You're going to have to pay attention to the trichomes.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.440]  You're going to have to be prepared to flush about 10 or 14 days before harvest.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:01.320]  This is going to take a close eye.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:04.160]  You need to pay attention to your trichomes.
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:08.120]  Oftentimes when I'm running seeds that are brand new and I don't know what to expect,
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:10.920]  I already decided they're going 70 days.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:14.760]  I want to let them flower 70 days and see what they give me.
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:19.400]  If I decide 70 days was too long, I can run them less time next time, but I like to give
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:24.160]  them the opportunity to show me what could happen if I go a little bit too long.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.880]  Some plants really like to bulk up that last week.
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:30.220]  Some plants really put on some extra trichomes that final week.
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:33.660]  Some plants really don't do shit for that last week except over ripen.
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:36.780]  You're going to have to learn your specific cultivar.
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:41.820]  In most cases, you will discover that nine weeks is just about right for most plants.
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:44.580]  Some will take 10 weeks if you want to get them perfect.
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:49.020]  Some are ready in eight weeks, which is really advantageous because that puts us a week ahead.
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:53.280]  We can produce another crop in a commercial environment that really helps out.
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:57.840]  For these lessons, we're going to focus on a nine week cultivar.
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:01.080]  We are now at the start of week seven in our flowering phase.
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:03.840]  At this point, the buds are starting to get really fat.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.260]  They should be getting really sticky.
[01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:08.320]  They should be putting off some very nice aromas by now.
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.520]  They may be starting to make some very nice colors.
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:16.240]  If you are growing from seed, different phenotypes will start becoming very obvious at this point
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:17.960]  in the flowering stage.
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:20.260]  You may have one phenotype that has gotten way taller.
[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:22.460]  You may have a phenotype that has stayed shorter.
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:24.560]  You may have one that is way branchier.
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:29.100]  You will really start seeing the different traits now that we are later in flower.
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:31.020]  Week seven is what I call the fill week.
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:32.620]  The buds will really start filling in.
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.780]  The trichomes will really start getting dense.
[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:37.420]  This is when the photos really start getting hot.
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:40.660]  I think weeks six through nine are great for photos.
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:44.060]  It only gets better as we go on until it is time for harvest.
[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:46.020]  Get out your camera and take some great photos.
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:48.040]  You're going to get good beefy buds.
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:49.800]  You're going to get good trichome development.
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:53.760]  And soon, you're going to start getting those sweet fall colors.
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:59.760]  Now let's focus in on the environmental conditions for our grow room in week seven of flower.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:03.360]  Our buds are getting big and beefy, so we need to reduce the humidity.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:06.680]  If we have too much humidity in the room, we do run the risk of bud rot.
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:08.480]  We run the risk of powdery mildew.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:10.200]  So let's reduce the humidity.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:14.720]  Let's bring it down to around 30 or 40% relative humidity in the room.
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:17.900]  This will help us reduce the risk of bud rot.
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:23.300]  So the first change is that we should reduce the humidity by 5 to 10% if possible.
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:29.220]  The next thing I would recommend is to reduce the temperature by just a few degrees if possible.
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:33.580]  We have been running our flowering room somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees during the day.
[01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:37.780]  I would like to knock that down just three to five degrees if possible.
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:41.340]  Let's try to get it 77 to 75 degrees in there.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:45.680]  And as the weeks go on, I would like to reduce it about three to five degrees every week
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:47.040]  until harvest.
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.760]  So this week, let's drop it down by three degrees.
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:53.120]  If you're already at 80 degrees, let's get it down to 77.
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:56.920]  If you're down at 77, let's crank it down about 75.
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:59.440]  Let's make these plants think that winter is coming.
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:02.000]  That colder environment will bring out more colors.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.480]  That colder environment will bring out more terpenes.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:07.000]  That colder environment will make your buds more dense.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.680]  And I feel like it also speeds up the finishing time of our plants.
[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:14.180]  So let's make it just a little bit colder during week seven.
[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:16.900]  Now let's talk about our nutrients for week seven.
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:21.060]  This is going to be our last opportunity for feeding our plants.
[01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:23.220]  We can start reducing our base nutrients.
[01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:27.500]  We don't need as much nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium as we have in the past.
[01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:31.300]  You can almost eliminate the nitrogen at this phase of flowering.
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:34.900]  We don't want to overfeed them, but we do want to make sure that they get a nice boost
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:36.380]  for their last feeding.
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:40.220]  So make sure you include some phosphorus and potassium to make those buds swell.
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.200]  I would also include some CalMag.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:45.480]  Don't go too hard on the CalMag at this point because it is really hard to flush it out
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:49.600]  and you may taste it if you go too hard with CalMag at this point.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:53.680]  I would always encourage a kelp product this late in flower that will add to your flavors
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:54.920]  and aromas.
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:59.640]  I do like an enzymatic product this late in flower because it keeps my root zone healthy.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:03.000]  I also use a microbe product this late in flower.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.920]  I have mentioned that we should taper off the microbes and start increasing the bloom
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:08.080]  boosters.
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:13.140]  But if your budget will allow, I would include microbe products this late in flower.
[01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:17.820]  Now the thing to focus on on this feeding is one final bloom booster feeding.
[01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:21.420]  I don't know what product you're using as a bloom booster, but this is probably your
[01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:25.560]  last opportunity to add that bloom booster to your nutrient regimen.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.760]  So make sure you get that in there at this feeding time.
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:31.260]  This is the last week to fertilize our plants.
[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:33.940]  Next week we are going to begin the flushing phase.
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:37.560]  So if you want to boost those plants up one last time, if you've been saving one bottle
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:42.040]  of something or one little scoop of something, this is the last time to fertilize those plants
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:47.340]  because at the start of week eight, we are going to begin the flush phase.
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:50.280]  Now at this point in the game, we've got big fat chunky buds.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:54.520]  I shouldn't have to say this, but I want to remind everybody, it is too late to spray
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:57.120]  any pesticides on these plants.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:59.120]  They're coming down in 21 days.
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.680]  We don't want the plants to taste like anything we applied as a pesticide.
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:05.320]  So please do not spray your plants.
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:07.880]  Also do not use a sulfur burner.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:10.080]  I've mentioned that in previous episodes.
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:14.600]  Using a sulfur burner at this point in flower will make your plants taste like total shit.
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:20.240]  It will taste like smoking a pack of matches or it will taste like smoking a can of fish.
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:22.440]  So please turn off the sulfur burner in flower.
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:25.900]  I wish everybody would just get rid of the sulfur burner and find out what is actually
[01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:29.120]  causing the problem and cure the problem.
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:32.520]  So no pesticides, no sulfur burners this late in flower.
[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:34.720]  What is acceptable is predator bugs.
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:39.100]  If you have got a pest issue, release an excessive amount of predator bugs.
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:40.400]  Hopefully you've been on top of that.
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:44.680]  Hopefully you don't have a problem, but I understand shit happens in cultivation.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:48.840]  So predator bugs are the way to go at this stage of the game.
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:52.880]  The little satchels that you hang, the little teabag looking things, it's too late for those.
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:56.500]  You need the live predators that are ready to release, that are hungry, that are ready
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:47:00.640]  to get in there and destroy your spider mites or whatever pest you may have acquired.
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:02.280]  You need the live active bugs.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:05.960]  They're a little more expensive, but they're the only thing that are effective at this
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:07.520]  stage of flower.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.080]  So again, do not spray anything.
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:10.440]  Do not use a sulfur burner.
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:15.640]  And if you do see any insects, any pests, get in there with some predator bugs and hopefully
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:18.720]  those predators will eradicate your infestation.
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:20.960]  Another thing you can do is defoliate.
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:25.760]  If you do see any signs of pests, remove any infested leaves, mark the plant so that you
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:28.820]  know where that infestation was and come check frequently.
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:32.580]  Do what you can to minimize the problem in that area.
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:37.780]  At this point in the game, I also suggest you defoliate any yellow or funky leaves.
[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:40.740]  Any leaves that look unhealthy are pest attractants.
[01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:43.980]  So get those dead funky leaves out of the grow.
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:46.660]  Defoliate anything that is obvious that needs to come off.
[01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:49.660]  If you've got some nice fall looking colors and you want to leave those pretty leaves
[01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:51.520]  on there for photos, you can do that.
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:55.680]  But the minute it starts getting crunchy and it is dead, decaying matter, it needs to come
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:56.680]  off of the plant.
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:59.880]  It is okay to have a few dead leaves at this point in the game.
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:03.300]  We've got a full grow, we've got a full canopy, we've got a lot of space.
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:06.120]  There will be some dead funky leaves in the garden.
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:08.180]  Sometimes a leaf just doesn't get enough light.
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:09.520]  Sometimes a branch gets bumped.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:10.520]  Things will happen.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.840]  You will have some funky leaves.
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:12.840]  Don't freak out.
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:16.080]  If it is excessive, you may have a problem that needs to be diagnosed.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:19.840]  But a few funky leaves at this stage are not a problem.
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:23.600]  Now another thing we should keep our eyes open for at this stage of the game are late
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:25.960]  flower hermaphrodites.
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:28.080]  You should be scouting daily for pests.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:31.560]  You should be scouting daily for powdery mildew and boitritis.
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:35.920]  During that visual inspection, you should also be looking for hermaphrodites.
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.680]  Look at the top buds of the plants.
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:41.160]  Look at the middle buds of the plants and definitely look at the lower part of the plant
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:43.440]  where you were not getting a lot of light.
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:46.100]  Do you see any male flowers?
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:48.520]  Do you know what a male flower looks like?
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:53.560]  Could you identify a hermaphrodite flower if it walked up and bit you on the nose?
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:57.680]  If not, I recommend you do a little bit of Google research and know what a hermaphrodite
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:02.160]  flower looks like so you do not allow them to happen in your garden.
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.440]  So at this point of the game, we still need to keep our eyes open for pests and mold problems
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:10.200]  and we also need to keep an eye out for hermaphrodites.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:14.560]  Now I've spoken in a previous episode about how to handle the herms if you should get
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:15.560]  one.
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:16.560]  Don't freak out.
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:17.560]  Don't go crazy.
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.280]  Spray it with some water and think of your options.
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:21.500]  Do you want to remove the male flower?
[01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:22.640]  Do you want to remove the bud?
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:24.080]  Do you want to remove the branch?
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.920]  Or do you want to get rid of that whole plant?
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.000]  It is up to you.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.040]  It is your garden.
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:30.360]  You're going to have to make decisions like that.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:33.920]  If there is just one little hermaphrodite flower, I would spray it with water, pick
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:35.160]  it out with tweezers.
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:39.340]  If you've got two or three that are on one bud, maybe cut that bud or that branch off.
[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:43.280]  If you've got several hermaphrodite flowers popping up in different spots on a plant,
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:45.400]  it may be time to get rid of that plant.
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:49.840]  You have a lot of things to think about because this late in flower, will those male flowers
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:51.800]  do anything to the rest of your crop?
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:56.280]  If you're just running one flowering cycle, you're probably too late into the grow to
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:57.400]  seed anything.
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:01.520]  If you've got a perpetual cycle going on, those plants that are earlier in flower may
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:05.280]  be ready to receive that pollen should that hermaphrodite release pollen.
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:07.400]  So you've got things to think about.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:11.320]  Now if you do have a hermaphroditic plant in your grow room, don't give clones of that
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:12.640]  to anybody.
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:15.480]  Please don't pass out hermaphrodite clones to your friends.
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:19.560]  If you want to continue to grow it, that is fine, but don't give a herm out to anybody.
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:21.240]  You're setting them up for failure.
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:24.160]  We don't want to do that to our friends and fellow growers.
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:28.080]  Now the last things I have written down for week seven is plenty of airflow.
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:32.020]  We need a lot of airflow in the grow room as these buds start getting chunkier.
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:33.640]  We may need more fans.
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.360]  I want to see every leaf move.
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:39.640]  I don't need every plant and every leaf getting beat down by the wind, but I want every leaf
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.040]  just to get a little rustle occasionally.
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:46.000]  As the fans oscillate, I want every fan to just feel that fresh air.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.760]  Just change that air around my leaves.
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:49.880]  That way I know the environment is getting shuffled.
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:51.720]  We don't have a bunch of CO2 in one area.
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:53.960]  We don't have a bunch of humidity packed up over here.
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:57.960]  I want to mix that air all day long and keep that air fresh for my plants.
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:02.560]  So have plenty of airflow in your grow as we get late into flower.
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:06.720]  Now the next thing I want to talk about is kind of preparing us for the future.
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:10.640]  We plan to cut this crop down in approximately 21 days.
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:14.680]  Do you have seeds or clones prepared for your next run?
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:19.480]  If you have another grow space, now is the time to get your seeds or clones prepared
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:20.920]  for your next run.
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:23.040]  That way we don't have a bunch of downtime.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:26.680]  That way as soon as these plants are harvested, you can move fresh plants right into that
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:29.080]  grow room and never miss a day.
[01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:32.400]  In the future, I do plan on updating my perpetual grow lesson.
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:35.720]  I did write a very long perpetual grow podcast.
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:37.960]  I think it is episode 73.
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:41.940]  So if you're interested in scheduling a perpetual grow, go check out episode 73.
[01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:46.480]  But I will update that because in Colorado we have made quite a few changes to our laws.
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:51.600]  I want to write a perpetual grow episode based around our Colorado plant count limits.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:53.320]  So that is coming in the future.
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:55.180]  But let's focus on today.
[01:51:55.180 --> 01:52:01.200]  You need to get plants prepared for your next run if you have got an available veg space.
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:05.680]  So now's the time to buy clones or acquire clones from either your fellow growers or
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:07.600]  a dispensary or however you get them.
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:11.760]  Or now is the time to start germinating seeds and getting them started so that when that
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:15.880]  grow room is empty, we can clean it up and we can refill it and you never miss a day
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:16.880]  in there.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:19.800]  So that is the basics of week seven of the flowering cycle.
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:21.760]  Let's move right into week eight.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:26.200]  In week eight, we want to continue to reduce the temperature and humidity.
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:30.300]  Let's get that humidity down between 25 and 35% relative humidity.
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:33.760]  This will make it a little bit dry in the room for the last two weeks, but it will also
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:36.600]  help us prevent powdery mildew and boetritis.
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:40.600]  We don't want to get mold right up the center of our big giant buds.
[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:42.420]  So let's start by reducing the humidity.
[01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:47.480]  The next thing we can do is we can reduce the temperature by three to five degrees.
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:52.580]  At this point of the phase, I would like to be somewhere between 70 and 74 degrees Fahrenheit
[01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:54.740]  during the lights on cycle.
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:57.980]  Now week eight is what I call the final swell week.
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:52:59.700]  You will see your buds take off.
[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:00.700]  They will get huge.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:01.700]  They will get chunky.
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.320]  They will start becoming covered in trichomes.
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:10.340]  It is time to really start paying attention to your trichomes with a 60 or 100X powered
[01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:11.340]  microscope.
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:15.060]  You need to get in there and look at those trichome heads, see what color they are.
[01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:16.060]  Are they clear?
[01:53:16.060 --> 01:53:18.220]  Are they getting that milky whitish blue color?
[01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:20.380]  Have they started becoming amber?
[01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:23.600]  That is how you determine the ripeness of your cannabis plants.
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:28.220]  So it's time to get in there and start paying close attention to the trichomes on our cannabis
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:29.220]  plants.
[01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:33.580]  Now these plants are also going to be super sticky and super stinky, but they should also
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:35.980]  be putting off some amazing colors.
[01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:40.440]  So now is another great opportunity to take more photography.
[01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:44.320]  As we enter the flush phase, we will start seeing more colors come from the plants.
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:46.720]  We're going to start removing nutrients from the plants.
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:48.360]  We're going to push some of the color out.
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:52.080]  Some of the green is going to disappear, which will allow room for reds and golds and a lot
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:55.280]  of great colors that you didn't know were coming from these plants.
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:58.000]  This is going to be an exciting two weeks.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.320]  So we've reduced the humidity.
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:00.840]  We have reduced the temperature.
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:03.440]  Now let's start flushing our plants.
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:05.040]  Flushing is free.
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:08.040]  I have done an entire episode on flushing our cannabis plants.
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:09.480]  It is episode 320.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:11.680]  I go into great detail.
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:14.840]  Quickly here, I will explain how and why we flush.
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:18.440]  For the past at least nine weeks, we have been shoving nutrients into these plants.
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:20.560]  They are filled with a lot of nutrients.
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:22.880]  We do not want to smoke all of those nutrients.
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:24.160]  They are stored in the buds.
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:25.920]  They're stored within that plant.
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:28.480]  By flushing the plant, we're starving it of nutrients.
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:32.880]  We will make that plant use up all of the nutrients stored within its systems.
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:36.040]  We will also remove all of the nutrients from the soil.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:40.840]  So we basically want to wash out the medium to make no nutrients available to allow that
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:44.960]  plant to starve itself so that it will use up all of the nutrients that is stored over
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:46.720]  its flowering cycle.
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:51.400]  By removing the nutrients from all of the buds, it will make the buds burn and smoke
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:55.300]  and taste much better if they are properly dried and cured.
[01:54:55.300 --> 01:54:58.720]  We still need to get all the way through a harvest and dry and cure phase.
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:03.480]  But at this point, flushing is the first step to getting a tasty final product.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.040]  So let's start flushing.
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:06.120]  Flushing is very easy.
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:08.800]  When you water the plants, don't add any nutrients.
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:13.680]  You can adjust the pH somewhere between 6.2 and 6.5 and just water the plants until you
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:15.680]  get 20% runoff.
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:20.600]  If you pour in a gallon of water in a pot, you want 20% of that gallon to run right out
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:22.160]  of the bottom of that pot.
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:26.520]  So give them a few heavy waterings and you will wash out all of those nutrients.
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:29.400]  Then just continue to water until harvest time.
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.400]  That is flushing.
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:35.040]  Flushing is simple and it is free and it will make your plants taste so much better
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:36.960]  if you do it correctly.
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:41.040]  Have you ever smoked flowers that taste like you just stuck your tongue in a light socket?
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:44.240]  Chances are those buds were not flushed properly.
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:49.640]  That person did not allow a 10 to 14 day flush phase before he harvested his plants and now
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:51.760]  they taste like complete shit.
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:52.760]  Flush your plants.
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:53.760]  I've said it a couple times already.
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:54.760]  It is free.
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:56.920]  Why don't you want to do free shit to your plants?
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:59.780]  You don't have to use nutrients and it saves time.
[01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:03.420]  All you got to do is fill the container with water, adjust the pH, pour it on the damn
[01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:04.420]  plants.
[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:05.420]  Let's flush the plants.
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:09.980]  That is what we're going to focus on in weeks eight through nine is flushing the plants
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:13.980]  for harvest so that they taste good once we dry and cure them.
[01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:18.100]  Now before I harvest, I like to do a pre-harvest defoliation.
[01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:22.220]  I generally like to do this seven to 10 days before harvest.
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:26.460]  So that may happen in the middle of week eight or at the beginning of week nine.
[01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:30.220]  Any leaf that has a petiole that I can grab, I just go in there and peel it right off.
[01:56:30.220 --> 01:56:33.220]  I don't need a bunch of leaves at this point of the flowering phase.
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:34.620]  Those leaves have done their job.
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:36.300]  It is almost time to cut down these plants.
[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:39.180]  I want to make the harvest cruise job just a little bit easier.
[01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:44.900]  So I like to go through and pull off all of the big leaves seven to 10 days before harvest.
[01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:49.180]  Now that is a good way to segue us right into week number nine.
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:52.900]  At the beginning of week nine, if you haven't done it already, feel free to go in there
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:55.420]  and pull off all of the big leaves.
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:56.900]  Those leaves have done their jobs.
[01:56:56.900 --> 01:56:58.220]  We don't need them anymore.
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:01.060]  Let's take them off of there and get them out of the room.
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:05.700]  Now let's talk about the environmental conditions in our grow room for week nine.
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:09.420]  This is the final week of our flowering phase.
[01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:15.380]  I like to reduce the humidity to approximately 25 to 30% humidity at the end of the flowering
[01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:16.380]  phase.
[01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:17.380]  My buds are huge.
[01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:18.380]  My buds are chunky.
[01:57:18.380 --> 01:57:22.180]  I do not want to risk bud rot in the middle of those buds.
[01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:27.860]  So I reduce that humidity down to about 25% relative humidity in my flowering room.
[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:30.220]  I also like to get it nice and cool.
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:35.460]  If I can get it about 70 to 74 degrees for the last week of flower, that really will
[01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:37.700]  make the colors pop out of the plants.
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:40.660]  It will make them more dense and it will give you more trichomes.
[01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:44.580]  And I really think the plants pack on a little beef once it gets colder and it will also
[01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:45.900]  speed them up.
[01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:49.780]  I feel like making it nice and cold at the end of the season tricks our plants into believing
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:51.020]  it is fall.
[01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:52.020]  Winter is coming.
[01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:53.860]  They say, oh, I do not have a lot of time left to live.
[01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:57.820]  So they really start doing everything they can do to ripen up and reach the end of their
[01:57:57.820 --> 01:57:58.860]  life cycle.
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:02.460]  So that is why I try to make it a little colder in the grow room at the end of the growth
[01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:03.940]  cycle.
[01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:08.280]  Another thing that a lot of growers like to do at the end of a flowering cycle is reduce
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:09.280]  the lights.
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:12.780]  Currently, you are probably running 12 on and 12 off.
[01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:18.660]  Toward the end of the flowering cycle, you can always reduce it to 10 on and 14 off.
[01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:22.300]  Reducing your light cycle will also make the plants think that the end is near.
[01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:25.380]  They will speed up a little bit and they will finish more quickly.
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:29.100]  I think that having it a little bit cooler and having a little less light in the room
[01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:31.080]  makes the plants finish a little sooner.
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:33.660]  It also makes them pack on a little more trichomes.
[01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:35.460]  It makes the buds a little more dense.
[01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:39.660]  And also, I think it gives us a little more terpene presence.
[01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:41.340]  Terpenes are destroyed by light.
[01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:42.940]  Terpenes are destroyed by warmth.
[01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:47.500]  Why not give them a little cool and a little dark and we can have a little more terps?
[01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:49.180]  And we're also saving a little bit of money.
[01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:51.540]  We're not using nutrients because we're flushing.
[01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:53.900]  And now we're running the lights for two hours less per day.
[01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:55.540]  So we're saving electricity.
[01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:57.620]  We're saving the electricity on running the bulbs.
[01:58:57.620 --> 01:59:00.940]  Plus, we're probably saving a little bit of electricity on cooling since we don't have
[01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:02.660]  to cool to fight those lights.
[01:59:02.660 --> 01:59:06.380]  So we're saving electricity and we're also saving time on our gear.
[01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:10.820]  So why not reduce the lights just a couple of hours at the last week of flower?
[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:13.380]  Now here's a little secret that I haven't shared with a lot of people.
[01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:17.520]  If you've got a plant that takes way too long to flower and you need to speed it up
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:22.260]  just a little bit, you can reduce those lights by four hours at the end of flowering and
[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:25.940]  those plants will finish approximately a week earlier.
[01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:30.380]  If you've got a 10 week strain or an 11 week strain and at the end of week nine, you crank
[01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:36.100]  those lights down to eight hours on and 16 hours off, that plant will finish one solid
[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:37.100]  week early.
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:40.820]  Now you may not get the harvest weight you would get if you let it go for that full 11
[01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:44.740]  or 12 week period, but sometimes we just need the plants to be done.
[01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:45.820]  We need that space.
[01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:46.820]  We need that room.
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:50.420]  So that is always a trick you can use to speed up some plants.
[01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:51.700]  So we have reduced humidity.
[01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:53.060]  We have reduced our temperatures.
[01:59:53.060 --> 01:59:54.940]  Now we have reduced our light cycle.
[01:59:54.940 --> 01:59:57.980]  We are on the final home stretch here in week nine.
[01:59:57.980 --> 01:59:58.980]  Keep flushing.
[01:59:58.980 --> 01:59:59.980]  Don't add any nutrients.
[01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:05.080]  Obviously, please do not apply any pesticides or any foliar feeds to your plants this late
[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:06.080]  in flower.
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:07.080]  You will taste it.
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:08.080]  You will notice it.
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:09.380]  It will ruin the entire crop.
[02:00:09.380 --> 02:00:12.240]  This week is our final bulking and ripening week.
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:14.220]  You will see that final bulk come on.
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:15.860]  They'll start getting fat and chunky.
[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:18.620]  All of your leaves are going to start getting yellow and starting to droop down and get
[02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:20.980]  a little crinkly because we've been flushing.
[02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:24.980]  And hopefully you're paying attention to those trichomes because this is when the trichomes
[02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:28.700]  are really going to start turning amber and showing their progress.
[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:31.080]  So week nine is the bulk and ripen week.
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:33.980]  It is almost time to chop down the plants.
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:35.780]  So keep a close eye on the trichomes.
[02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:36.940]  We've been flushing.
[02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:40.960]  If you decide the plants are not done and you want to let them go a little bit longer,
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:46.220]  you can let them flower for an extra week and you don't have to give them any more nutrients.
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:49.980]  Don't mess your whole cycle up by adding nutrients in and then trying to cut it down seven days
[02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:50.980]  later.
[02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:51.980]  You've already been flushing.
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:53.620]  You're already doing it perfectly.
[02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:54.780]  Don't mess it up now.
[02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:57.780]  If it needs to go longer, let it go longer.
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:02.940]  If you are early in flower and you anticipate you may need an extra week or two, again,
[02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:05.420]  repeat my advice from week seven.
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:10.220]  Week seven is where you extend your schedule if you're going to go longer than three weeks.
[02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:12.020]  So let's act like we are right on schedule.
[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:13.540]  We're ending up week nine.
[02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:14.920]  We have defoliated the plants.
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:16.700]  We haven't ran into any problems.
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:22.780]  The next thing to think about is do you have your harvest and drying and curing area prepared?
[02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:28.100]  Are you ready for a sticky, stinky, time-consuming and space-consuming harvest?
[02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:31.420]  When you cut down the plants, where are you going to hang them?
[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:35.800]  They're going to be there for at least a week, maybe seven to 14 days, depending on
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:36.940]  your environment.
[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:38.340]  Do you have space for that?
[02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:39.340]  Is it secure?
[02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:40.340]  Is it safe?
[02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:41.740]  Will people be showing up?
[02:01:41.740 --> 02:01:45.640]  When people show up, are they going to smell your hanging plants?
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:49.260]  Do you need to plan ahead to keep that aroma away from visitors?
[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:53.820]  Do you need to do something to keep intruders and thieves away from that harvested product?
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:56.140]  Now is the time to start thinking about that.
[02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:59.140]  You don't want to say, hey, it's the time to cut down these plants and walk in there
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:01.640]  with scissors and cut them down, and then you're stuck.
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:02.840]  You don't know what to do.
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:05.420]  Start thinking about that now.
[02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:09.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, the next step in my grow lessons is harvest.
[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:11.400]  Our next step is to harvest these plants.
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:13.540]  That is only followed by drying and curing.
[02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:17.200]  And the next step after that is to clean and reset our grow rooms.
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:22.020]  So if you've made it this far, you are one episode from cutting down your plants.
[02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:24.760]  Then after that, all we've got to do is dry it and cure it.
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:29.840]  And the step after that is finally sampling our finished product.
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud of you.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.840]  I hope you've made it all the way through nine weeks of flowering without any issues.
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:38.500]  If you did run into issues, I hope you were able to solve those problems without messing
[02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:39.560]  up your crop.
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:44.540]  If you've got any questions about anything I have said in this nine week flowering episode

[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:30.080]  I want to give a huge shout out to my buddy Juanzilla.
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:35.280]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:36.420]  Welcome back, everybody.
[02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:40.320]  It's time for episode 387 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:43.680]  This episode of the show is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:48.480]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:54.320]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:58.400]  It's become a tradition that I start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm dabbing.
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:03.760]  I just took a ridiculous dab of Stardog Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:05.200]  Everybody knows I love the Stardog.
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:06.960]  It is one of my favorite strains.
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:09.960]  This is going to be a great podcast intro.
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:13.520]  If you've been following along with the podcast, you know that I've been doing a long series
[02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:15.040]  of grow lessons.
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:19.960]  This episode is going to be a repost of an episode about determining ripeness.
[02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:23.360]  This was originally posted as episode number 319.
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:25.640]  This episode does feature White Mike.
[02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:30.280]  The original episode was about 45 minutes long, but I cut out the part about determining
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:33.480]  ripeness, and that was approximately 20 minutes.
[02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:37.320]  I plan to be out of town for a couple of days this week, so I won't be able to put together
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:39.240]  a quality podcast.
[02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:43.500]  I've got this episode about determining ripeness, and I feel like it falls perfectly in line
[02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:45.980]  with the grow series that we have been doing.
[02:05:45.980 --> 02:05:49.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, let's jump right into this old school episode
[02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:52.300]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast featuring White Mike.
[02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:57.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is episode 319, determining ripeness, reposted as episode
[02:05:57.540 --> 02:05:58.540]  387.
[02:05:58.540 --> 02:05:59.860]  I do hope you enjoy it.
[02:05:59.860 --> 02:06:00.860]  Yeah.
[02:06:00.860 --> 02:06:02.580]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:06.580]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[02:06:06.580 --> 02:06:07.580]  news, education, and conversation.
[02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:08.580]  That's right.
[02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:13.420]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[02:06:13.420 --> 02:06:17.140]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the
[02:06:17.140 --> 02:06:21.020]  current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:22.020]  I'm your host.
[02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:23.220]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:26.420]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:30.380]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:34.780]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.

[02:06:38.260 --> 02:06:42.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint, pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:52.140]  dab rig because it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:06:52.140 --> 02:06:53.140]  What's up, podcast world?
[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:56.220]  It's time for episode 319 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:06:56.220 --> 02:06:57.460]  Thanks again for joining me.
[02:06:57.460 --> 02:06:59.300]  Sitting across the table is White Mike.
[02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:00.300]  Welcome back to the show, bro.
[02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:01.300]  Thanks, man.
[02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:02.300]  Thanks for having me.
[02:07:02.300 --> 02:07:04.900]  Oh man, thanks for taking time out of the busy schedule of two kids.
[02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:05.900]  Congratulations.
[02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:06.900]  Dos ninos.
[02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:07.900]  It's a lot.
[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:08.900]  Dos ninos.
[02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:09.900]  Yeah, you can tell where we're from.
[02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:10.900]  Welcome.
[02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:14.740]  We're doing a show from Pueblo, Colorado, where the white guys speak real good Spanish.
[02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:18.180]  I was just in an Instagram live feed and somebody tried to throw out some German and
[02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:21.660]  I responded in German and the whole room just went silent.
[02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:22.660]  The entire chat stopped.
[02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:25.620]  I was like, well, I apologize for that.
[02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:26.620]  I thought that was funny.
[02:07:26.620 --> 02:07:28.460]  Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:28.460 --> 02:07:29.460]  Welcome Mike's on the show.
[02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:32.620]  We're going to do a show about, what are we going to talk about?
[02:07:32.620 --> 02:07:35.460]  Determining ripeness and when to harvest your cannabis plants.
[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:41.900]  Before we get there, you know I like to start the episodes by stalking about, yeah, let's
[02:07:41.900 --> 02:07:43.540]  talk about what I've been dabbing.
[02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:45.460]  That was hard to say.
[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:51.100]  I've been taking dabs of some Viola Labs Clementine Cookies Live Resin.
[02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:53.660]  I'm opening it up to smell it right now.
[02:07:53.660 --> 02:07:59.580]  It is like spicy orange candy and I really love the smell and flavor of this.
[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:01.820]  I picked up three grams today when I went.
[02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:03.660]  I usually just get one gram of each flavor.
[02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:05.340]  I was like, do they have more of that?
[02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:06.340]  They do.
[02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:08.100]  I'll just take three and I will be on my way.
[02:08:08.100 --> 02:08:10.620]  Mike, is it time to change that microphone cover?
[02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:12.540]  Is that what you're subliminally telling me right now?
[02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:17.660]  It's got a furry spot, but I've got Malamute, so I'm used to furry spots.
[02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:20.100]  We're going to blame that on your Malamutes.
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:23.300]  It's not Malamute hair, but it's not hippie hair either.
[02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:25.380]  So I'm cool just pulling it off and rolling with it.
[02:08:25.380 --> 02:08:27.900]  But yeah, we might want to look for a new cover after this show.
[02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:29.420]  Welcome to the furry spot podcast.
[02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:31.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's going to be that kind of show.
[02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:33.500]  We're going to put this show back on track.
[02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:35.340]  We've got a couple of sponsors we should shout out.
[02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:37.740]  Shout out to my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:38.740]  Shout out to water.
[02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:39.740]  Shout out to water.
[02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:40.740]  You're drinking water now.
[02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:41.740]  You guys, Mike is drinking water.
[02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:42.940]  This is like a rare occasion.
[02:08:42.940 --> 02:08:45.860]  I didn't pack properly for this mission.
[02:08:45.860 --> 02:08:47.060]  Then some water's happening.
[02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:48.340]  You need some water anyway, Brian.
[02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:49.540]  I don't feel bad for you.
[02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:52.060]  And then he went and spilled half of it right down your face.
[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:53.060]  Mike's drinking water, you guys.
[02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:54.060]  That's a rare occasion.
[02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:55.060]  Ah, the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:08:55.060 --> 02:09:00.700]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company at dankseed.store.

[02:09:06.260 --> 02:09:10.260]  Guys, I know you want to know what's going on in your grow room at all times.
[02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:12.900]  You're like, I wonder if that air conditioner clicked on.
[02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:13.900]  It's pretty hot outside.
[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:16.140]  I wonder if that air conditioner is working.
[02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:17.140]  I wonder.
[02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:18.140]  You can't even focus.
[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:19.140]  You can't even think about what you're doing.
[02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:20.500]  You're like, ah, is that air conditioner working?
[02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:22.740]  You want to drive home and look, but you can't drive home.
[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:23.740]  You're just freaking out.
[02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:24.740]  You know what?
[02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:25.740]  Bust out your phone.
[02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:27.100]  Check out your PL Minder unit.
[02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:29.060]  You can see what's going on in your grow room at all times.
[02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:30.700]  How do you get a PL Grow?
[02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:32.220]  How do you get a PL Minder unit?
[02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:33.580]  You go to PL Grow dot systems.
[02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:34.580]  That's how.
[02:09:34.580 --> 02:09:35.900]  Check them out at PL Grow dot systems.
[02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:38.740]  You guys, PL Grow Systems Minder unit.
[02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:41.380]  We'll let you know what's going on in your grow room at all times.
[02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:42.380]  You can relax.
[02:09:42.380 --> 02:09:43.380]  You can enjoy what you're doing.
[02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:44.380]  It's awesome.
[02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:45.380]  All right, let's move forward.
[02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:49.420]  Uh, YouTube, you guys, all of the YouTube videos are caught up.
[02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:50.420]  I did it.
[02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:54.540]  It took a long time, but they are finally there.
[02:09:54.540 --> 02:09:56.580]  That was a multi-year project.
[02:09:56.580 --> 02:10:00.500]  I, YouTube got evil right before.
[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:01.620]  Right at the scariest time.
[02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:05.540]  Yeah, it was just about caught up and then all of the YouTube channels started disappearing.
[02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:09.100]  I don't put videos of myself consuming on this channel.
[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:10.660]  That might be your saving grace.
[02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:13.100]  So yeah, I talk heavily about it, but they don't see it.
[02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:16.380]  So unless they're looking for it and someone reports it, we should be okay.
[02:10:16.380 --> 02:10:18.340]  Uh, we'll see how long it lasts.
[02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:21.300]  Either way, if it does disappear, I'll find a new place to put it.
[02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:22.300]  Don't worry.
[02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:25.700]  Um, YouTube is, uh, that's just another place for more people to listen to the show.
[02:10:25.700 --> 02:10:29.220]  I think we'll probably get more, more listens, more views, more interactions.
[02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:35.500]  All right, Mike, you got anything to say before we start talking about, um, determining right
[02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:36.860]  likeness on cannabis plants?
[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:40.340]  You got any topics you want to bring before we get on a ramble here?
[02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:41.340]  Not yet.
[02:10:41.340 --> 02:10:42.340]  We'll just see where it takes us.
[02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:44.540]  Mike says, we'll see where this takes us.
[02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:45.540]  All right.
[02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:49.260]  So a lot of people were talking on Instagram live and on chat rooms right now about how
[02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:51.820]  to decide when to harvest their cannabis.
[02:10:51.820 --> 02:10:54.420]  When is my cannabis right?
[02:10:54.420 --> 02:10:58.180]  Um, the seed packs are going to tell you a certain timeframe.
[02:10:58.180 --> 02:11:00.180]  They're going to say 56 to 63 days.
[02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:01.940]  They're going to say 63 to 70 days.
[02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:04.980]  They're going to say nine to 10 weeks.
[02:11:04.980 --> 02:11:10.540]  The first time you run that pack of seeds, I would say go the longest timeframe that
[02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:11.940]  they give you as an option.
[02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:13.540]  At least plan for it for sure.
[02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:14.540]  Yes.
[02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:15.540]  Yeah.
[02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:19.820]  If it says 10 week, nine to 10 weeks, go the 10 weeks because maybe in that last week,
[02:11:19.820 --> 02:11:22.620]  that's when you're going to see extra trichomes pack on.
[02:11:22.620 --> 02:11:24.500]  You're going to see the extra weight come on.
[02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:26.700]  You're going to see maybe some cool colors.
[02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:31.180]  You might, you may, you may see some shit you don't see if you cut it down at week nine.
[02:11:31.180 --> 02:11:32.220]  So let it go 10 weeks.
[02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:38.060]  If it says 10 weeks, if it says 56 to 63 days, let it go 63, let it go 65 if it looks
[02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:40.820]  okay and see what happens.
[02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:48.660]  So that being said, the way to determine ripeness of your cannabis plants is not by looking
[02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:50.720]  at the hairs.
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:54.640]  It is not by looking at the shape of the buds.
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:59.740]  It's not by looking at, I did air quotes when I said, I'm just, I'm hearing different people
[02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:04.340]  throughout my cannabis career.
[02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:10.700]  Like speaking at length about how all of those are telltale signs of, of like either perfect
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:16.100]  or good or, or, or completed or not ready to harvest or it's all nonsense.
[02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:17.100]  Yeah.
[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:21.980]  Uh, what we are growing cannabis for the viable part that we want are the trichomes.
[02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:24.700]  Why would we look at anything but the trichomes?
[02:12:24.700 --> 02:12:27.940]  We want to harvest those when they're at their ripest point.
[02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:30.820]  So we should be paying attention to the trichomes.
[02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:34.780]  The only way you can do that, you can, if somebody tells you they can see the trichomes
[02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:39.900]  with their naked eye, uh, either steal their eyes or kick them in the dick because they're
[02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:40.900]  a liar.
[02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:44.540]  You cannot see amber trichomes without some sort of magnification.
[02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:50.460]  You need at least 60 X, maybe a hundred X magnification to see if a trichome is clear,
[02:12:50.460 --> 02:12:54.100]  cloudy, silver, milky, amber, busted, ruptured.
[02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:57.620]  Uh, if the head's broken off of it, you need magnification.
[02:12:58.300 --> 02:12:59.300]  You cannot see that with the naked eye.
[02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:00.860]  And if you can, you're fucking awesome.
[02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:02.140]  Uh, send me a message.
[02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:03.140]  I want to hear about it.
[02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:04.140]  Yep.
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:05.140]  Good.
[02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:07.740]  Uh, get on Amazon, start looking at scopes folks.
[02:13:07.740 --> 02:13:08.740]  Yeah.
[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:09.740]  Get yourself a, like a jeweler's loop.
[02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:13.180]  I have a scope from dino light that hooks up to my computer.
[02:13:13.180 --> 02:13:15.380]  I plug it right into the USB slot.
[02:13:15.380 --> 02:13:20.780]  It took me just a few minutes to mess with the drivers to make it a link up to my computer.
[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:22.660]  Once it linked up, it was no problem ever.
[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:24.540]  I opened up the application.
[02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:28.900]  I'm able to run the scope over the plants and I can focus it in and I can see those
[02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:34.740]  trichomes very large on my computer screen and it makes it very, and I can take pictures.
[02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:37.860]  So if I can't tell exactly what I'm looking at, I can reach over and I think I press F
[02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:40.100]  11 and I take a photo right there.
[02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:41.100]  Boom.
[02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:43.940]  Then I can go look later and I can see if that plant's ripe or not.
[02:13:43.940 --> 02:13:48.260]  The computerized scope makes life a lot easier, but you can pick out something kind of like
[02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:49.540]  a jeweler's loop.
[02:13:49.540 --> 02:13:52.420]  That's a lot less expensive and just as functional.
[02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:54.300]  The 420 scope will work for you.
[02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:56.860]  Just a basic jeweler's loop will work for you.
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:58.340]  There's one that hydro farm sells.
[02:13:58.340 --> 02:14:00.020]  It spreads in half.
[02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:03.220]  It's got batteries in it and then it splits in half and the batteries are in one side
[02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:05.660]  and the optics are actually on the other side.
[02:14:05.660 --> 02:14:07.300]  They make a 60 and a 100 X.
[02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:10.360]  I would recommend the 100 X if you go for that.
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:12.340]  That's probably the best one on the market.
[02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:15.420]  If you're going to get something like that, that I'm aware of, there's probably something
[02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:19.360]  better by now, but get some magnification.
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:21.500]  Magnification will help you out in so many ways.
[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:25.140]  You'll be able to tell if your trichomes are clear, if they're silver, if they're cloudy,
[02:14:25.140 --> 02:14:27.820]  if they're milky, if they're amber, if they're ruptured.
[02:14:27.820 --> 02:14:32.180]  Also you'll be able to identify the pests and the funguses and the problems on the undersides
[02:14:32.180 --> 02:14:35.860]  of your leaves more accurately if you've got a scope to look at those things.
[02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:39.540]  It's a really useful tool throughout the growth cycle for sure.
[02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:40.540]  Yeah.
[02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:43.940]  Once you've got all of your tools dialed in and you've got some money to spend on a couple
[02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:46.780]  of extra toys for the grow room, get yourself a scope.
[02:14:46.780 --> 02:14:47.780]  It will really help.
[02:14:47.780 --> 02:14:50.180]  A scope or a loop or something that hooks up to your computer.
[02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:52.180]  All right.
[02:14:52.180 --> 02:14:55.580]  So the hairs are not going to tell you how ready your plant is.
[02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:56.580]  Mike just tapped his headphones.
[02:14:56.580 --> 02:14:57.580]  Are you too hot there?
[02:14:57.580 --> 02:14:58.580]  No, I just got an itch.
[02:14:58.580 --> 02:14:59.580]  All right.
[02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:00.580]  Scratch it up, buddy.
[02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:01.580]  Good boy.
[02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:02.580]  Good boy.
[02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:03.580]  His leg's starting to go because he's scratching behind his ear, you guys.
[02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:04.580]  A little twitching.
[02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:05.580]  All right.
[02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:11.180]  The only thing that's going to tell you if your cannabis plants are ripe are the trichomes.
[02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:12.420]  We're growing for trichomes.
[02:15:12.420 --> 02:15:13.420]  That's what we want.
[02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:15.940]  If you're growing to make quality flowers, if you're going to make edibles, if you're
[02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:19.220]  going to make extracts, if you're going to make anything, the trichomes are what matter.
[02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:21.060]  So pay attention to that.
[02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:22.060]  Nothing else.
[02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:26.740]  Now, the way that you could tell the trichomes, you're going to see the trichomes develop
[02:15:26.740 --> 02:15:27.740]  on your plant.
[02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:31.460]  If you have a scope and you can pay attention through the entire process, do that.
[02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:34.220]  Watch those trichomes go from a little bitty stalk.
[02:15:34.220 --> 02:15:35.820]  Watch them develop ahead.
[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:38.540]  Watch the head of that trichome fill up.
[02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:39.540]  You'll watch it fill up.
[02:15:39.540 --> 02:15:42.900]  It'll get juicy and then it'll start to change colors.
[02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:43.900]  It'll go from clear.
[02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:48.100]  Then it'll slowly turn to like a silverish color.
[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:50.260]  Then it'll get cloudy.
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:51.760]  Once you see it, you'll know.
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:54.980]  Right now you're going, what does he mean by cloudy?
[02:15:54.980 --> 02:15:58.780]  Imagine if you got a fishbowl and then you put some dish soap in there and stirred it
[02:15:58.780 --> 02:15:59.780]  up.
[02:15:59.780 --> 02:16:00.780]  It's cloudy.
[02:16:00.780 --> 02:16:02.740]  That's what your cloudy trichomes are going to look like.
[02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:03.740]  That's cloudy.
[02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:07.460]  Now, your next step after cloudy is milky.
[02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:09.700]  Sometimes they turn kind of bluish in my opinion.
[02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:11.060]  They have a hint of blue.
[02:16:11.060 --> 02:16:12.700]  They have that.
[02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:16.740]  If you stare at like certain white paints and whatnot, you'll start to see a blue kind
[02:16:16.740 --> 02:16:17.940]  of undertone a little bit.
[02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:19.780]  Yeah.
[02:16:19.780 --> 02:16:22.060]  A nice patch of milky trichomes.
[02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:25.180]  I always see just a little hint of light blue in there.
[02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:29.260]  The fishbowl I talked about a minute ago, imagine if I took your fishbowl that had ... We
[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:32.380]  dumped out the dish soap because this is just going to get gross if we keep adding stuff.
[02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:33.380]  I'm gross.
[02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:34.660]  Let's do this differently.
[02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:38.500]  Imagine if you took a fishbowl that's got water in it and you poured just enough milk
[02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:42.020]  in there to make it turn light white.
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:43.020]  Light white.
[02:16:43.020 --> 02:16:46.660]  It's not going to be fucking boom like ice cream, but it's going to be light white.
[02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:49.180]  If you poured some creamer in your coffee, you just lighten it up.
[02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:50.340]  You can see it now.
[02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:52.500]  Now that trichome is what I would call milky.
[02:16:52.500 --> 02:16:54.700]  That is a milky trichome.
[02:16:54.700 --> 02:16:57.100]  You're almost ready for harvest.
[02:16:57.100 --> 02:17:01.660]  The next step that's going to happen is going to look like you had a spray bottle.
[02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:04.780]  Imagine if I took like the little spray bottle that you're spraying your plants with or whatever
[02:17:04.780 --> 02:17:07.100]  that little mister bottle.
[02:17:07.100 --> 02:17:11.420]  What if I poured some Dr. Pepper in there and I walked right up to your trichomes and
[02:17:11.420 --> 02:17:16.220]  just give it a little spritz of Dr. Pepper?
[02:17:16.780 --> 02:17:20.180]  Your trichomes are going to have a little amber spritz on them now.
[02:17:20.180 --> 02:17:22.380]  That's exactly what I think it looks like.
[02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:26.140]  You sprayed some soda right onto your trichomes.
[02:17:26.140 --> 02:17:30.220]  They're going to go from milky and then you're going to see just a couple of them get this
[02:17:30.220 --> 02:17:34.140]  amber color, this Dr. Pepper color right across them.
[02:17:34.140 --> 02:17:38.420]  You're going to see it happen toward the top and right in the middle.
[02:17:38.420 --> 02:17:41.020]  Pay attention to the whole plant because it's going to move around.
[02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:45.060]  When you see that first bit of amber, really start paying attention because you've got
[02:17:45.060 --> 02:17:46.780]  a very short time now.
[02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:50.260]  They're going to start, that amber is going to start progressing throughout the plant
[02:17:50.260 --> 02:17:52.100]  really quickly.
[02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:57.020]  When you look at the scope and you can see, you're going to have to look around the plant.
[02:17:57.020 --> 02:18:04.980]  When 30% of those trichomes start becoming amber, that's when you want to cut down, 30%.
[02:18:04.980 --> 02:18:06.820]  I say look in several places.
[02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:10.660]  You're going to be like, 30%, how do I know when I can see a hundred trichomes in there?
[02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:13.420]  Just look around and use your best judgment, you guys.
[02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:17.860]  25 to 35% is where you want to aim for.
[02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:21.980]  You're not going to notice a difference if you're a few days off on your harvest, honestly.
[02:18:21.980 --> 02:18:23.940]  You are not going to notice a huge difference.
[02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:26.140]  You've got a dry and cure period.
[02:18:26.140 --> 02:18:30.680]  Once you cut down these plants, those trichomes are going to continue to change all the way
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:33.020]  until the moment you combust them.
[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:34.060]  You're going to cut them down.
[02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:35.780]  You've got this dry period.
[02:18:35.780 --> 02:18:37.560]  They're going to get beat up in harvest.
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:38.900]  They're going to get cured.
[02:18:38.900 --> 02:18:40.060]  They're going to change.
[02:18:40.060 --> 02:18:43.100]  There's going to be so many different changes in those trichomes.
[02:18:43.780 --> 02:18:46.780]  Just a couple of days in your harvest window will not make a huge difference.
[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:47.980]  You're not going to notice it.
[02:18:47.980 --> 02:18:51.060]  It's not going to hurt your feelings.
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:52.340]  Pay attention to those trichomes.
[02:18:52.340 --> 02:18:53.880]  Get yourself a scope.
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:54.880]  They're going to go clear.
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:57.180]  Then they're going to turn silver.
[02:18:57.180 --> 02:18:58.420]  Then they're going to get cloudy.
[02:18:58.420 --> 02:19:01.340]  That's when it starts getting exciting.
[02:19:01.340 --> 02:19:04.500]  They're filling up with trichomes or with cannabinoids now.
[02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:07.740]  They've got different things in there, different psychoactive ingredients inside of there that
[02:19:07.740 --> 02:19:10.060]  are changing every day.
[02:19:10.060 --> 02:19:11.140]  Then they're going to get milky.
[02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:13.080]  They're going to turn a little bit blue.
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:15.720]  Then they're going to look like I sprayed them with Dr. Pepper.
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:20.760]  When three out of 10, when 30% of them have that Dr. Pepper stain on them, that's when
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:24.320]  it's time to cut.
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:28.480]  You're going to say, but it's my first grow with this plant.
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:29.480]  How do I plan that?
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:34.360]  How do I properly be able to flush and look out for trichomes to be amber?
[02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:37.680]  I thought of a great way that we can all be safe.
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:42.360]  Keep in mind, this isn't going to be the last time you're growing this strain, hopefully.
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:43.600]  This is the first time you grew it.
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:45.920]  That's why you don't know when the trichomes are going to change colors.
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:47.360]  That's why you don't know how long it's going to take.
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:48.360]  It's the first time.
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:50.560]  You're developing a relationship with this plant.
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:51.920]  The first time you got to learn it.
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:53.600]  The second, third time, you dial it in.
[02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:57.000]  The fourth and fifth time, you fucking perfect this grow.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.080]  You're just learning this one.
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:00.520]  Think about it this way.
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:07.240]  If you're growing a 60-day plant, if the package says grow it for 55 to 60 days, go that 60
[02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:08.240]  days.
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:11.920]  If you're going to go for 60 days, flush it day 50 and really start paying attention to
[02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:13.480]  those trichomes.
[02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:18.120]  If you want to cut it down at a specific day, just make sure you flushed 7 to 10 days pretty
[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:19.120]  heavily.
[02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:23.000]  I'd like to go 14, but 7 to 10 days should be plenty.
[02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:27.560]  If you want to let your plant go 70 days, if you've got something I bred, you probably
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:28.960]  want to let it go 70 days.
[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:31.680]  If I bred it 70 days, no problem.
[02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:34.980]  Start flushing at day 60 and pay attention to your trichomes.
[02:20:34.980 --> 02:20:36.460]  You can cut down at day 70.
[02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:38.900]  If you don't feel like it's ready, let it go a little bit longer.
[02:20:38.900 --> 02:20:40.880]  It doesn't need nutrients to keep going.
[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:45.600]  It's just going to start getting tired, but then you can give it time to ripen up.
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:52.520]  I think the way to judge when to harvest your cannabis is by paying attention to the trichomes.
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:56.640]  If you don't have a way to look at the trichomes, you don't have a way to accurately judge the
[02:20:56.640 --> 02:20:58.720]  ripeness of your cannabis plants.
[02:20:58.720 --> 02:21:02.240]  You run the risk of cutting them way too early, is what most people do.
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:05.420]  If you feel like they're done, wait 3 to 5 more days.
[02:21:05.420 --> 02:21:09.800]  If you can wait 7 more days, wait, because they're only going to get better.
[02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:12.680]  Don't cut too early because you're anxious and eager.
[02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:13.680]  Patience.
[02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:14.680]  Patience.
[02:21:14.680 --> 02:21:17.720]  You cut clones or you grew from seeds and those took time.
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:20.400]  Then you veged it out and you spent a lot of money on nutrients.
[02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:24.720]  You've already spent, you're probably going to put 115 days into it.
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:26.400]  Why not put 122?
[02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:27.400]  What's another week?
[02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:28.400]  Right.
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:29.400]  I know you start getting itchy.
[02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:32.000]  You start getting that crackhead lips and you start scratching your neck.
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:33.400]  You're like, yeah, I want to cut it down.
[02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:37.120]  I'm thinking of a friend of mine who was always in there clipping lower nut.
[02:21:37.120 --> 02:21:41.360]  He'd start at the bottom of the plant and start taking nugs and drying them out as fast
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:44.240]  as he could to keep himself covered.
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:48.480]  By the time he got the harvest, it was just like the top coal is left on the plant.
[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:49.480]  Yeah.
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:52.720]  Then there's nothing to enjoy because you fast dried everything.
[02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:56.800]  You could have just had one huge harvest and actually saw a harvest.
[02:21:56.800 --> 02:22:00.280]  You could see what it looks like, what your work actually did instead of just destroying
[02:22:00.280 --> 02:22:03.040]  your work slowly and not getting any reward.
[02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:04.640]  Be patient, you guys.
[02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:08.400]  That's one of the main things that it's hard to learn when you're growing cannabis.
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:10.560]  Sometimes you just need to hide your scissors.
[02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:11.560]  Send Mike home with the scissors.
[02:22:11.560 --> 02:22:14.080]  Be like, bro, take these so that I can't cut my plants up.
[02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:16.320]  You're like, you're on suicide watch or something.
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:20.440]  Just take these, bro, so I can't fuck up.
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:23.480]  I guess that was a pretty quick way to do it, but I mean, that's right to the point.
[02:22:23.480 --> 02:22:25.680]  There's no other way to explain that.
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:29.520]  Get a jeweler's loop, get some sort of magnification and look at your trichomes.
[02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:32.040]  I know I keep saying it, we're growing for trichomes.
[02:22:32.040 --> 02:22:34.520]  We don't care about all that leafy green shit.
[02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:39.000]  You just got to get in there with some magnification and spend some time reading the plant.
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.480]  Yeah, we're not worried about all the green leafy part.
[02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:42.880]  I mean, that part tastes good.
[02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:43.880]  That's fun to smoke.
[02:22:43.880 --> 02:22:45.880]  That's a cool carrier, but the trichomes are the goal.
[02:22:45.880 --> 02:22:47.840]  So make sure they're ripe.
[02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:54.880]  Something that I should add, if you are growing for concentrates, maybe cut a little bit early.
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:59.640]  Start flushing early and harvest a little bit early because if you want nice and clear
[02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:03.240]  concentrates, maybe this is some industry secrets I shouldn't be sharing with the general
[02:23:03.240 --> 02:23:04.680]  public, but here you go, guys.
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:06.320]  I love you and this is free.
[02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:10.640]  If you want nice and clear concentrates, cut your plants down before the trichomes start
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:11.840]  getting dark.
[02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:15.760]  If they start getting dark, what you're extracting is trichomes.
[02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:18.800]  Your concentrates will come out a little bit darker.
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:20.960]  Cut them down when they're nice and clear and guess what?
[02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:22.200]  Nice and clear concentrates.
[02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:23.200]  It's easier.
[02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:26.800]  A lot of concentrate makers can make super clear concentrates out of everything now,
[02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:27.880]  but it's easier.
[02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:28.880]  It's less to clean up.
[02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:32.920]  It's less work if you're pulling it down when you have got nice and clear trichomes.
[02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:34.280]  Start early and process quickly.
[02:23:34.280 --> 02:23:35.280]  Yep.
[02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:36.280]  They cut them down.
[02:23:36.280 --> 02:23:37.280]  I don't even want to tell you what week.
[02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:40.480]  Sometimes like week seven-ish I've seen it go for concentrates.
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:44.600]  Yeah, a little bit ridiculous, but then you can pull a whole one more harvest a year.
[02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:47.820]  If you cut everything down at the end of week six, then you could fit one more harvest a
[02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:50.840]  year in your schedule.
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:51.920]  That's business, unfortunately.
[02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:52.920]  You guys do not do that.
[02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:53.920]  Be patient.
[02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:54.920]  Let it go long enough.
[02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:56.240]  Let it be done.
[02:23:56.240 --> 02:24:00.560]  Like Axel Rose said, all we need is just a little patience.
[02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:02.040]  All right, podcast world.
[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:05.760]  I want to thank you once again for listening to this episode about determining ripeness
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:07.040]  of your cannabis plants.
[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:09.640]  I'll be back in just a few days with another episode.

[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:34.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's all I've got for you for this episode.
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:36.480]  I look forward to seeing you in just a few days.
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:39.200]  I want to give a huge shout out to James Butterson.
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:43.360]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:44.520]  Welcome back, weed world.
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:48.240]  It's time for episode 388 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:51.080]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:55.640]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:25:01.520]  You can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:05.280]  It has become a tradition that I start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.320]  Today, I'm taking dabs of Fatso OG from Green Dot Labs.
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:11.900]  This is the Fatso OG full spectrum extract.
[02:25:11.900 --> 02:25:13.200]  It's nice and chunky.
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:16.920]  It's got just the right amount of chunky crystals and just the right amount of terp sauce in
[02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:17.920]  there.
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:19.340]  I really do approve of that ratio.
[02:25:19.340 --> 02:25:23.520]  The cross on this or the blend actually is GMO and Legend OG.
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:27.760]  The flavor is described as dark roast coffee, garlic, and fuel.
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:29.960]  I feel like that is absolutely accurate.
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:31.840]  It has given me some ridiculous cotton mouth.
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:34.600]  I feel like you can almost hear it on the microphone.
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:37.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have been having a really busy couple of weeks.
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:38.480]  I've been out of town twice.
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:40.640]  I'm going back out of town Thursday.
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:42.280]  I have a comedy show in Denver.
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:47.600]  Then I will be attending the Indo Expo in Denver on Saturday and Sunday.
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:50.640]  I am doing another repost for this episode.
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:53.040]  The last episode was determining ripeness.
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:57.600]  Now that we know when the plants are ripe, it is time to begin flushing our plants.
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:02.240]  I feel that many new growers and many experienced growers overlook the importance of flushing
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:05.200]  our plants and it is not happening properly.
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:08.840]  I'm going to say this in the episode over and over again, but flushing is free and it
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:12.320]  can improve the overall quality of your finished product.
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:16.520]  Why wouldn't we focus heavily on flushing at the end of the growth cycle?
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:19.560]  I'm sure I'm going to say that plenty of times through this episode.
[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:23.920]  With no further ado, let's jump right into an episode about flushing our ripe cannabis
[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:25.680]  plants before harvest.
[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:27.040]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:30.040]  It's time for episode 320 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:33.360]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:37.240]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:40.120]  you can find them at dankseed.store.
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:43.040]  Also make sure you check out our friends at PL Grow Systems.
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:46.440]  You can find them at PLGrow.systems.
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:51.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, first off, let me apologize for my terrible sounding voice.
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:56.160]  Our friend Brett, also known as Mary's Motivation, had a going away party and I went to that
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:01.960]  going away party and I smoked way too much flour and way too much concentrate and my
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:02.960]  voice sounds like crap.
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:04.600]  I got a little bit of a chest cold.
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:05.800]  I got a throat thing going on.
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:07.280]  I got a sinus thing happening.
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:11.120]  Before we get too far, I just want to apologize and I want to thank you for listening to this
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:13.480]  episode while I sound like poop.
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:14.520]  All right.
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:17.600]  I'd like to start the episode off by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:22.560]  Today, I'm taking little baby dabs of Gorilla Glue 4 Ambrosia and also I've got some of
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:26.880]  the New York City Diesel Ambrosia Batter, both from Apothecary.
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:27.880]  It's been a nice mix.
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:31.640]  I'm just going light today, just trying to stay lightly medicated and not mess up my
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:33.120]  lungs and throat again.
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:37.080]  I'm on the path to recovery and I want to keep moving forward.
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:41.400]  So a minute ago, I mentioned that I went to my friend Brett, also known as Mary's Motivation.
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:43.600]  I went to Brett's going away party.
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:45.800]  Brett is leaving the country.
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:49.240]  Brett's a little scared and nervous about his trip, but honestly, I don't think anybody
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:50.960]  deserves this more.
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:52.920]  Brett needs to make this adventure happen.
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:55.240]  I think it's going to be a great experience for him.
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:58.620]  So I'm super proud and super excited for him.
[02:27:58.620 --> 02:28:00.520]  His party was awesome.
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:05.000]  At the party, we were joined by, of course, the always awesome Brett was there, Dabbing
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.560]  Granny and Kevin showed up.
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:10.340]  Also Lucy, Mama Bear Dabs was there.
[02:28:10.340 --> 02:28:11.340]  Always good to see Lucy.
[02:28:11.340 --> 02:28:14.900]  I got to bump into my friend Twisty Seeds, who I don't see very often.
[02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:18.260]  I got to have a conversation, a long conversation with Chandler Dabbing.
[02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:19.260]  That was pretty cool.
[02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:21.180]  Earl Tycoon was there.
[02:28:21.180 --> 02:28:22.940]  The dude from Hits on Hand was there.
[02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:27.460]  LJ Fresh was there and several other new and old friends were there hanging out.
[02:28:27.460 --> 02:28:29.100]  It was a great party.
[02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:33.620]  There were a couple of folks there who brought canna gars, which are basically blunts rolled
[02:28:33.620 --> 02:28:36.580]  with cannabis leaves as the wrapper.
[02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:38.220]  That really fucked up my lungs, you guys.
[02:28:38.220 --> 02:28:40.740]  My lungs did not like that at all.
[02:28:40.740 --> 02:28:45.300]  They were delicious to smoke and we got really lit, but that is why I think I sound like
[02:28:45.300 --> 02:28:46.300]  crap today.
[02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:48.680]  So shout out to Brett for the great party.
[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:51.860]  The party was a private party, so not a lot of people were invited.
[02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:53.900]  The event was at Cultivated Synergy.
[02:28:53.900 --> 02:28:56.700]  I owe a huge shout out to everybody at Cultivated Synergy.
[02:28:56.700 --> 02:29:00.560]  Every time we do an event there, every time we do a large or a small party there, it goes
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:01.820]  very well.
[02:29:01.820 --> 02:29:03.220]  The place is very inviting.
[02:29:03.220 --> 02:29:06.380]  The staff is very accommodating and I always have a great time.
[02:29:06.380 --> 02:29:09.540]  So there's big shout out to everybody who came to the party.
[02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:13.420]  Extra huge shout out to Brett for inviting me, who was only able to invite 30 people.
[02:29:13.420 --> 02:29:16.180]  I was honored to be amongst those 30.
[02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:17.880]  It was a great party, you guys.
[02:29:17.880 --> 02:29:20.540]  We smoked that place out for how few people there were in there.
[02:29:20.540 --> 02:29:24.200]  It was a pretty big building and we smoked that bitch out pretty good.
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:25.420]  You can hear it in my voice still.
[02:29:25.420 --> 02:29:30.060]  All right, while I've still got some good voice left, let's do a quick podcast about
[02:29:30.060 --> 02:29:33.420]  flushing your plants before harvest.
[02:29:33.460 --> 02:29:36.060]  Before we talk about flushing, I should do a quick recap.
[02:29:36.060 --> 02:29:40.420]  In the last episode, I talked about determining ripeness.
[02:29:40.420 --> 02:29:43.140]  Mike and I went fairly fast and we got kind of rambly.
[02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:47.680]  So I hope I made it clear that determining ripeness is usually done by using some sort
[02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:50.580]  of a loop so that you can see the trichomes.
[02:29:50.580 --> 02:29:54.300]  I mentioned using a 60 or 100X loop.
[02:29:54.300 --> 02:29:59.340]  One of our friends from Instagram, what's up, Dank Sinatra, our friend Dank Sinatra,
[02:29:59.340 --> 02:30:04.500]  sheer photo and seeds, sent me a message and he says, now I can't see trichomes with
[02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:09.780]  my naked eye, but I can tell ripeness of a trichome with a 16X jeweler's loop.
[02:30:09.780 --> 02:30:15.580]  He said, of course, in my mind, I'm in my mid-20s, so my eyes may work a little better.
[02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:17.700]  Yes, dude, you are a little bit younger than me.
[02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:20.340]  You got those fresh new eyes.
[02:30:20.340 --> 02:30:21.900]  But he corrected me.
[02:30:21.900 --> 02:30:25.180]  He says he can see the trichomes with the 16X jeweler's loop.
[02:30:25.180 --> 02:30:28.780]  So you may not need that bigger loop, that 60, that 100.
[02:30:28.780 --> 02:30:32.820]  He says the 60 is working or the 16 is working for him.
[02:30:32.820 --> 02:30:34.140]  So I stand corrected.
[02:30:34.140 --> 02:30:35.900]  You may not need that big loop.
[02:30:35.900 --> 02:30:38.060]  16 may get you through.
[02:30:38.060 --> 02:30:42.100]  Also, let's recap a little bit about what I said about harvest times.
[02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:46.580]  I said that if you have a plant that is said to go 60 days, let it go the full 60 days
[02:30:46.580 --> 02:30:48.620]  and start flushing at day 50.
[02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:53.380]  If you've got a plant that's supposed to go 70 days, let it go the full 70 days and start
[02:30:53.380 --> 02:30:55.580]  flushing around day 60.
[02:30:55.580 --> 02:31:00.540]  Now, you may say, Rasta Jeff, I want to dial it in and cut these plants down at the perfect
[02:31:00.540 --> 02:31:01.540]  ripeness.
[02:31:01.540 --> 02:31:03.140]  Yes, you're going to have to dial that in.
[02:31:03.140 --> 02:31:07.500]  Something I wanted to stress is this is not your last grow with this strain.
[02:31:07.500 --> 02:31:11.220]  Hopefully this is your first run with this cultivar, with this cut.
[02:31:11.220 --> 02:31:14.780]  So now you've got a new girlfriend that you've got to learn a little bit.
[02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:16.740]  You've got to take her out a couple of times.
[02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:23.860]  You got to see if she wants to come down at day 60, day 63, maybe day 67, maybe day 72.
[02:31:23.860 --> 02:31:26.500]  You've got to dial it in exactly to the right date.
[02:31:26.500 --> 02:31:28.060]  Now, you're going to see differences.
[02:31:28.060 --> 02:31:31.540]  If you use different nutrients, you may get different ripening days.
[02:31:31.540 --> 02:31:35.380]  If you have a little bit of temperature difference, you may get a different ripening day.
[02:31:35.380 --> 02:31:38.420]  So you're going to have to find the window and dial that in.
[02:31:38.420 --> 02:31:40.900]  Hopefully this is not your last grow with this cut.
[02:31:40.900 --> 02:31:44.580]  Hopefully this is the first of many grows with a good cut.
[02:31:44.580 --> 02:31:49.460]  So if it's your first run with the 60 day cut, start flushing around day 50.
[02:31:49.460 --> 02:31:53.680]  If this is your first time with a cut that you think may go 70 days, start flushing it
[02:31:53.680 --> 02:31:55.180]  around day 60.
[02:31:55.180 --> 02:31:59.660]  Now when you get to day 60 or day 70 on whichever plant you're running, you don't have to cut
[02:31:59.660 --> 02:32:02.380]  it down just because you've been flushing for 10 days.
[02:32:02.380 --> 02:32:04.420]  Start paying more attention to the trichomes.
[02:32:04.420 --> 02:32:07.360]  If they are not amber, don't cut it down.
[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:08.700]  Keep flushing for a few more days.
[02:32:08.700 --> 02:32:11.300]  It's better to over flush than under flush.
[02:32:11.300 --> 02:32:13.220]  The only thing you're doing is not giving it nutrients.
[02:32:13.220 --> 02:32:14.220]  It may have gotten a little bigger.
[02:32:14.220 --> 02:32:18.540]  It may have gotten a little beefier, but we're just trying to figure out the plant for the
[02:32:18.620 --> 02:32:19.780]  first time.
[02:32:19.780 --> 02:32:24.700]  So that is how to determine when to begin flush.
[02:32:24.700 --> 02:32:28.100]  If you don't know the cultivar that you're using, maybe it's a brand new seed, maybe
[02:32:28.100 --> 02:32:32.380]  it's a new clone, maybe you're just new at growing and you don't know when to cut it.
[02:32:32.380 --> 02:32:36.460]  Allowing the plant 60 to 70 days to grow and then giving yourself extra time at the end
[02:32:36.460 --> 02:32:38.820]  is always your best bet with a new cut.
[02:32:38.820 --> 02:32:43.660]  All right, so I feel like I have established how to tell if the plant is ripe and ready
[02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:44.660]  to cut down.
[02:32:44.660 --> 02:32:48.300]  And I feel like we have a good idea of when to start flushing.
[02:32:49.060 --> 02:32:51.980]  Let's actually talk about flushing our cannabis plants.
[02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:56.140]  I think flushing is super simple and it's something people could easily improve.
[02:32:56.140 --> 02:32:58.140]  And they're really skipping that step.
[02:32:58.140 --> 02:33:00.580]  And I'm not sure why, because it's free.
[02:33:00.580 --> 02:33:05.360]  It's a really easy step to improve your cannabis and it is free.
[02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:10.100]  Maybe people simply don't understand the importance of flushing and why it's important.
[02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:13.260]  So let me tell you quickly why flushing matters.
[02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:19.960]  Just imagine you've been pouring salty nutrients into this plant for nine weeks of flower plus
[02:33:19.960 --> 02:33:22.260]  another three or four weeks of veg.
[02:33:22.260 --> 02:33:24.460]  You've just been filling it up with nutrients.
[02:33:24.460 --> 02:33:26.740]  You've been pouring whatever nutrient brand you're using.
[02:33:26.740 --> 02:33:28.100]  You've been pouring nitrogen.
[02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:29.220]  You've been pouring phosphorus.
[02:33:29.220 --> 02:33:30.220]  You've been pouring potassium.
[02:33:30.220 --> 02:33:34.860]  And you've been pouring carbohydrates into these plants for the past 12 weeks.
[02:33:34.860 --> 02:33:38.060]  Now, all of that stuff is built up inside of that plant.
[02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:39.660]  The plant is not using all of it.
[02:33:39.660 --> 02:33:40.660]  It's letting some of it go.
[02:33:40.660 --> 02:33:44.860]  It's turning some of it into a gas and transpiring some of it out, but some of it is still in
[02:33:44.860 --> 02:33:46.100]  the plant.
[02:33:46.100 --> 02:33:51.340]  If those nutrients are left in the plant when we harvest, dry, and cure that plant, we're
[02:33:51.340 --> 02:33:52.380]  going to taste it.
[02:33:52.380 --> 02:33:55.620]  The plants are going to taste like crap.
[02:33:55.620 --> 02:33:59.700]  If you feed too much cow mag, too late in flower, you're going to taste it.
[02:33:59.700 --> 02:34:03.660]  If you feed your plants too much potassium silicate late in flower, you're going to taste
[02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:04.660]  it.
[02:34:04.660 --> 02:34:06.440]  Also, the plants are not going to burn properly.
[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:09.240]  When you dry and cure these buds, they're not going to smoke.
[02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:10.720]  You're going to grind it up in a grinder.
[02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:14.160]  You're going to roll a joint, and it's just going to burn black and make a funky, weird
[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:15.160]  charcoal.
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:18.720]  That's because there are leftover nutrients that you did not flush out.
[02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:22.840]  We can get that stuff out of there by properly flushing the plants.
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:25.480]  You are mostly flushing the soil.
[02:34:25.480 --> 02:34:29.040]  You want to clean out the soil so there's nothing left in your medium, whether it's
[02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:34.760]  soil, soilless mix, if you got peat, whatever you're working in, you're going to want to
[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:35.760]  flush that.
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:39.240]  If it's rock wool, if it's cocoa, you need to clean it out.
[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:43.040]  Each thing is going to take a different amount of time to clean out, but you want to clean
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:46.040]  that out so the roots don't have anything to eat.
[02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:49.600]  Then the plant will start starving itself, and it will start showing its harvest fall
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:55.280]  colors, and it will taste proper when you dry it, cure it, and smoke it.
[02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:56.360]  That's why flushing is important.
[02:34:56.360 --> 02:35:00.420]  You want to get all those excess nutrients out of there, all those excess salts.
[02:35:00.420 --> 02:35:04.660]  When you roll a joint and smoke it, you don't want it to turn into a little briquette.
[02:35:04.660 --> 02:35:10.000]  You want it to turn into a nice, white, fluffy ash and just flake away.
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:13.460]  That comes from a properly flushed plant.
[02:35:13.460 --> 02:35:17.380]  Then that also comes from a properly dried, cured, and trimmed plant, but that comes in
[02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:18.380]  the future.
[02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:20.580]  Today we're focusing on flushing.
[02:35:20.580 --> 02:35:22.020]  That's why flushing is important.
[02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:23.340]  You want your herb to taste good.
[02:35:23.340 --> 02:35:28.440]  You want it to burn well, and you want it to leave a nice, white, clean, soft ash with
[02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:31.020]  no weird chunks.
[02:35:31.020 --> 02:35:34.120]  Let's actually talk about flushing the plants.
[02:35:34.580 --> 02:35:36.280]  Harvesting the plants is really easy.
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:41.040]  About 10 to 14 days before you plan on harvesting the plants, prepare the amount of water that
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:43.080]  you would normally water the garden with.
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:47.040]  If you've got 1000 watt light, maybe you've got a five gallon bucket full of water, right?
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:49.120]  So get that amount of water ready.
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:52.720]  When you would normally put nutrients into the water, don't do that.
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:54.800]  Just don't put nutrients in there.
[02:35:54.800 --> 02:35:58.040]  Maybe if you're going to add anything, put some enzymes in there.
[02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:02.600]  If you're using an enzyme, that will help break down all the decaying roots and all
[02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:06.480]  the matter inside of the root zone, and it will speed up the process of the flush.
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:08.480]  It will help speed everything up.
[02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:13.120]  But enzymes are pretty much the only thing I would put in there other than maybe a little
[02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:14.600]  bit of shine.
[02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:18.800]  Maybe one to two grams of shine from veg bloom, but you really don't need it.
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:21.960]  Mostly all you would need is some enzymes for the last couple of days.
[02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:27.160]  If you're going to flush for 14 days, maybe go for like four to seven days, add two grams
[02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:31.480]  of shine and add some enzymes, but then cut out the shine and just keep the enzymes going
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:33.080]  until the end of the process.
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:37.520]  So the only thing you would put in there are enzymes and possibly some shine, but you would
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:40.360]  be probably just fine with nothing at all.
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:44.640]  So clean water, add the enzymes if you're going to do so.
[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:47.400]  For four to seven days, add the shine if you'd like to do so.
[02:36:47.400 --> 02:36:51.840]  Then adjust the pH to somewhere between 6.3 and 6.5.
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:53.800]  You'll be just fine, 6.3 and 6.5.
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:56.080]  That's a good window to adjust it to.
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:59.760]  Then simply water the plant with that minimal solution.
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:03.520]  All you've got to do is pour that right into the plants, just like you normally do when
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:04.520]  you water.
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:06.640]  Soak the plants and let it run through.
[02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:11.800]  Now what you're doing, pouring the enzymes in there is going to help the natural decaying
[02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:14.080]  process happen inside that root zone.
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:15.080]  There's dead things in there.
[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:17.080]  The roots that are dying are dying in there.
[02:37:17.080 --> 02:37:20.680]  The enzymes are going to eat that and they're going to speed up that process.
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:25.440]  Also that shine is going to keep adding density and trichomes and essential oils to your plants
[02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:27.120]  if you choose to add the shine.
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:30.240]  You still need to flush for the last week without the shine, you guys, so make sure
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:31.240]  you cut that out.
[02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:34.640]  You can leave the enzymes in there if you'd like to at the end, but cut out that shine
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:35.640]  for the last week.
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:38.000]  Now you're probably at day 50, right?
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.520]  If we're going to cut down at day 60, we're at day 50.
[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:43.760]  We just mixed up a bunch of water and we just soaked that root zone.
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:49.320]  So now you've got a pH water with enzymes and possibly some shine running through there.
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:52.800]  Those plants are going to start looking for phosphorus and potassium and molybdenum and
[02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:53.920]  all the other things that they want.
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:56.360]  There's 16 minerals that the plants really want.
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:37:59.720]  Start thinking about that and learn all 16 of them that will really help you think about
[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:01.400]  what you're feeding your plant.
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:04.200]  Maybe we'll talk about that in the future, but the plant's going to start looking for
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:07.320]  that stuff and all it's going to find are enzymes and shine.
[02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:09.440]  It's going to be like, well, I've got essential oils.
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:13.120]  I'm going to go beef up my trichomes and it's got stuff to build trichomes, but it doesn't
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:15.720]  have the building blocks to grow more plant material.
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:20.200]  It doesn't have all the nutrition that it needs to keep building bigger buds and fatter
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:21.480]  stems and going.
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:23.820]  So it's going to start showing you its fall colors.
[02:38:23.820 --> 02:38:26.820]  It's going to start turning into these yellow golden colors.
[02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:30.380]  You may get some reds, you may get some purples, you'll get some unique oranges.
[02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:34.180]  I really like taking pictures of my plants right at the flush phase because they really
[02:38:34.180 --> 02:38:35.540]  start showing great colors.
[02:38:35.540 --> 02:38:36.700]  The buds are nice and fat.
[02:38:36.700 --> 02:38:41.180]  The trichomes are all greasy and shiny and then the leaves start getting these cool golden
[02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:42.580]  tones to them.
[02:38:42.580 --> 02:38:45.020]  But that's when you know that the flush is working.
[02:38:45.020 --> 02:38:49.380]  There are no nutrients left in that soil for the plant to eat and it is getting hungry,
[02:38:49.380 --> 02:38:53.100]  which is a good thing because now you know that bud is going to burn smoothly.
[02:38:53.380 --> 02:38:59.260]  It's not going to have nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, molybdenum, iron, calcium, magnesium.
[02:38:59.260 --> 02:39:02.220]  It's not going to have all this other funky shit in it that we don't want to smoke.
[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:04.060]  It's just going to be nice and clean.
[02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:07.700]  It'll burn nice and smoothly and it will taste really good.
[02:39:07.700 --> 02:39:11.260]  So you're going to start seeing these fall colors come on.
[02:39:11.260 --> 02:39:17.500]  That timing is going to depend on your medium, how much nutrients you have been putting into
[02:39:17.500 --> 02:39:18.500]  the plant.
[02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:23.100]  The pH is going to be very strain specific and also temperatures are going to have a
[02:39:23.100 --> 02:39:24.340]  huge effect on this.
[02:39:24.340 --> 02:39:28.580]  If it's a little cooler in the room, your plants are going to turn a little more fall
[02:39:28.580 --> 02:39:29.580]  colors.
[02:39:29.580 --> 02:39:32.900]  If you have a lower nighttime temperature, you'll see a little more purple from the buds.
[02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:38.620]  You'll get a little more fall activity from the plants like what happened in nature.
[02:39:38.620 --> 02:39:40.180]  So you're going to mix up the solution.
[02:39:40.180 --> 02:39:41.180]  You're going to pH it.
[02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:42.740]  You're going to water in the plants.
[02:39:42.740 --> 02:39:44.500]  It's going to run out of the bottom.
[02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:50.140]  Then depending on your container size and the vapor pressure deficit in the room, you
[02:39:50.140 --> 02:39:52.920]  are going to have to water again.
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:54.580]  Repeat the process, you guys.
[02:39:54.580 --> 02:39:55.580]  Mix up your container.
[02:39:55.580 --> 02:39:57.060]  Put the enzymes in there.
[02:39:57.060 --> 02:39:58.620]  Put the shine in there.
[02:39:58.620 --> 02:40:03.620]  pH adjusted to 6.3 to 6.5 and water it right through the plants.
[02:40:03.620 --> 02:40:08.780]  Repeat this process right up to a week before harvest and then do the same thing, but simply
[02:40:08.780 --> 02:40:10.540]  take out the shine.
[02:40:10.540 --> 02:40:15.860]  Add the enzymes, adjust the pH, and then feed it right through the plants.
[02:40:15.860 --> 02:40:18.940]  Now the enzymes are totally not necessary.
[02:40:18.940 --> 02:40:20.620]  The shine is totally not necessary.
[02:40:20.620 --> 02:40:22.900]  You can do all of this with plain water.
[02:40:22.900 --> 02:40:27.940]  If you're adding the enzymes and shine, you are going to have connoisseur quality cannabis.
[02:40:27.940 --> 02:40:29.300]  That's what I would do.
[02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:31.700]  I would do the shine up to the last week.
[02:40:31.700 --> 02:40:33.100]  Then after that, I would just do the enzymes.
[02:40:33.100 --> 02:40:37.220]  Then I'd probably do just two or three days of plain water just to give them time to finish
[02:40:37.220 --> 02:40:38.220]  up there.
[02:40:38.220 --> 02:40:42.220]  If I was going that 60 days, I would end up going 63 and that last three days would
[02:40:42.220 --> 02:40:46.620]  just be plain water and micro is what would happen there.
[02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:47.980]  Just keep repeating the process.
[02:40:47.980 --> 02:40:50.140]  You want to rinse these plants out.
[02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:54.620]  You want to rinse the soil out as many times as you can between the start of flush and
[02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:55.620]  harvest.
[02:40:55.620 --> 02:41:00.000]  If you can get it to dry up and rewater it every other day, that's great.
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.180]  If it takes three or four days, that's fine.
[02:41:02.180 --> 02:41:06.260]  You're still going to get, if you do it 12 days, you'll get three waterings in there
[02:41:06.260 --> 02:41:07.940]  if you go every four days.
[02:41:08.660 --> 02:41:11.700]  If you're taking that much time to water, that means you've got a large container or
[02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:15.100]  that much time between waterings means you've got a large container, which means you're
[02:41:15.100 --> 02:41:19.500]  using quite a bit of water to flush that out, which means you need to make sure to get at
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:22.260]  least 10 to 30% runoff water.
[02:41:22.260 --> 02:41:26.260]  If you've got a 10 gallon pot, you're going to want to get at least one to two gallons
[02:41:26.260 --> 02:41:27.740]  of runoff coming out of that.
[02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:29.660]  That's how you know you're flushing well.
[02:41:29.660 --> 02:41:33.420]  Get plenty of water coming out and then flush the shit out of those plants.
[02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:37.420]  Do it as many times as you can, but be careful not to drown the plant.
[02:41:37.420 --> 02:41:41.220]  Don't try to sneak in another flush time just to get more water in there because that
[02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:43.340]  may do more harm than good.
[02:41:43.340 --> 02:41:44.820]  You may kill the fucking plant right there.
[02:41:44.820 --> 02:41:45.820]  You may just drown it.
[02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:46.820]  You may suffocate it.
[02:41:46.820 --> 02:41:47.820]  That may be the end.
[02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:49.660]  You may be cut down early.
[02:41:49.660 --> 02:41:50.660]  Don't ruin it right at the end.
[02:41:50.660 --> 02:41:51.660]  Be careful.
[02:41:51.660 --> 02:41:53.460]  Just stay on your normal watering schedule.
[02:41:53.460 --> 02:41:55.300]  Just make sure you soak the shit out of it.
[02:41:55.300 --> 02:41:56.300]  Let it dry out.
[02:41:56.300 --> 02:41:57.300]  Water it again.
[02:41:57.300 --> 02:42:00.780]  Do that as many times as you can in the last 10 to 14 days.
[02:42:00.780 --> 02:42:02.380]  If you want to add the enzymes, do that.
[02:42:02.380 --> 02:42:04.420]  If you want to use Shine, do that.
[02:42:04.420 --> 02:42:07.260]  Those are the only things I would really add at the end.
[02:42:08.100 --> 02:42:11.660]  We have determined how to tell if the plants are ripe.
[02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:14.620]  We have determined a good time to start flushing.
[02:42:14.620 --> 02:42:17.140]  We know what to put in the water to flush the plants.
[02:42:17.140 --> 02:42:18.840]  We know why we're flushing.
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:20.620]  We know how to flush.
[02:42:20.620 --> 02:42:24.540]  You basically don't mix anything up and you run that through the plants.
[02:42:24.540 --> 02:42:26.340]  This will clean out the soil.
[02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:27.640]  That is our main goal.
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:29.980]  As that's happening, we're going to see colors changing.
[02:42:29.980 --> 02:42:31.900]  We're going to see trichomes ripening.
[02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:33.820]  We're going to see plants finishing up.
[02:42:33.820 --> 02:42:35.800]  Now you're going to get a bunch of funky.
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:36.800]  You may.
[02:42:37.340 --> 02:42:39.080]  It depends on your genetics, your environment.
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:40.680]  It depends on a lot of things.
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:42.960]  You're going to get funky yellow leaves.
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:45.560]  You're going to get dead foliage.
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:47.120]  Pull that stuff off.
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:49.480]  There's no problem with just yanking that dead stuff off.
[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:50.480]  Make sure you throw it away.
[02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:54.800]  Get it out of the grow room, but just pull all that dead stuff off and throw it away.
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:42:59.600]  Now about a week, maybe five or three days before you harvest, go in the grow room and
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:01.920]  just start stripping off all the big leaves.
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:06.160]  This is going to save you a lot of time when it does come time to harvest.
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:08.560]  There won't be all these big giant leaves in your way.
[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:11.720]  Just cut them off while the plant is standing up, while they're still stiff, while they're
[02:43:11.720 --> 02:43:12.720]  still alive.
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:13.720]  You can just snap them right off.
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:14.720]  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[02:43:14.720 --> 02:43:15.720]  You can go really fast.
[02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:16.720]  You don't even need scissors for it.
[02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:20.720]  Once you get the thumb technique of just popping a leaf off, you can just go in there and defoliate
[02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:23.120]  a whole section really quickly.
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:27.240]  A few days before harvest, go in there and pull off all those big leaves.
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:32.040]  That will save you a big headache and a bunch of time when it comes time to harvest the
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:33.040]  plants.
[02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:34.040]  You hang them upside down, dry them, and cure them.
[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:36.520]  When it comes time to trim, half the leaves are already gone.
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:39.880]  It will save you a lot of bullshit and a lot of trouble.
[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:43.440]  When you see them starting to get funky, take off the dead ones.
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:48.520]  Then, just a few days before harvest, probably when you cut out the shine maybe, then go
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:50.480]  in there and start pulling off the leaves.
[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:54.440]  Now, another thing you might want to do is you might want to reduce the temperature just
[02:43:54.440 --> 02:43:56.440]  a few degrees.
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:01.960]  Do not create a large swing in temps between your day and night.
[02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:04.200]  Do not go too cold at night.
[02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:06.520]  Do not try to create something drastic.
[02:44:06.520 --> 02:44:10.560]  If you can bring it down two or three degrees during the day and two or three degrees during
[02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:12.560]  the night, do that.
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:13.900]  Don't go crazy, you guys.
[02:44:13.900 --> 02:44:15.560]  Don't shock the plants right at the end.
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:18.020]  Don't give yourself powdery mildew right at the end.
[02:44:18.020 --> 02:44:21.280]  Just try to mimic nature and get a little bit colder right at the end.
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:23.200]  What happens right at the end of the season?
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:24.200]  It gets cold.
[02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:27.920]  That's how things know, oh shit, it's wintertime, and those plants will hurry up and finish.
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:28.920]  You'll see more color.
[02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:33.920]  You get a little more density and cool temps are good for terpenes.
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:36.920]  Lower the temperatures a little bit right at the end.
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:41.240]  One thing I'm sure people are going to send me messages about and ask is, do I use any
[02:44:41.240 --> 02:44:42.440]  flushing agents?
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:44.760]  No, I do not use a flushing agent.
[02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:49.080]  I think all of the flushing agents are a sales tactic.
[02:44:49.080 --> 02:44:54.680]  They are not necessary, and I think they make your herb taste like whatever they taste like.
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:55.720]  It's the very end.
[02:44:55.720 --> 02:44:57.600]  Why would I want to put in a new ingredient?
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:01.440]  I want to get everything out, so I do not use a flushing agent.
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:06.520]  If I were to use anything, I would just use the solution I told you, the enzymes and the
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:09.040]  shine, and then I would add powdered coconut water.
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:12.280]  It would be the only flushing solution that I would use.
[02:45:12.280 --> 02:45:13.600]  A lot of people are saying, what?
[02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:17.560]  Yeah, coconut water would be ideal, but that would get very expensive to buy it and have
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:18.560]  that much coconut water.
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:23.380]  Imagine trying to get a five-gallon bucket of coconut water shipped to your house every
[02:45:23.380 --> 02:45:25.800]  three days for 14 days.
[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:26.800]  That's going to add up.
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:31.000]  It's going to get real expensive, but you can buy powdered coconut water.
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:34.080]  It is readily available from a lot of growth stores.
[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:35.640]  Build-A-Soil can take good care of you.
[02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:38.960]  They do not sponsor the show or anything, but I know that that's a reliable source for
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:41.440]  powdered coconut water.
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:44.960]  Also something I should mention, a lot of people are growing no-till.
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:51.600]  A lot of people are growing in living soil or super soil or some sort of live soil.
[02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:56.520]  You guys, if that is what you're working with, you probably do not need to flush because
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:01.240]  you have created the perfect environment inside your plant's rhizosphere to where it's taking
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:02.420]  up what it needs.
[02:46:02.420 --> 02:46:03.920]  You're not feeding it bottled nutrients.
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:07.480]  It's not being force-fed shit, so it doesn't need to be flushed anything.
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:11.360]  Our buddy Subcool, when he would mix up a batch of super soil and put a plant in there,
[02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:14.880]  he would just feed it water for the whole flowering phase, and he would say, I've been
[02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:17.720]  flushing the entire time.
[02:46:17.720 --> 02:46:21.840]  Before people start sending me emails, yes, there are some situations where you may not
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:22.840]  need to flush.
[02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:27.080]  If you're going no-till, if you're going all organic, flushing is not a thing.
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:30.880]  Now if you're running that, you're already up to speed and you know that.
[02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:32.620]  We don't need to teach you about flushing.
[02:46:32.620 --> 02:46:35.280]  You were in the advanced black belt class already.
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:39.360]  Now I've got one more thing I should mention before I wrap up this so-called quickie episode
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:40.360]  that's gone on for 20 minutes.
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:41.360]  You guys are very welcome.
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:42.360]  Thank you for listening.
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:50.080]  A good thing to do is to measure the EC or the PPMs of your runoff water.
[02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:52.800]  You were pouring a bunch of water into your plants, right?
[02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:53.800]  Collect it.
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:56.920]  Collect the water that comes out of the bottom of your plant into some sort of a vessel.
[02:46:56.920 --> 02:46:58.440]  Put your pH pen in there.
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:02.600]  Put your EC or PPM pen in there and see what the EC is.
[02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:06.320]  Now if you're in a soil or a soilless mix, you're only going to get down so low.
[02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:10.560]  If you're in cocoa, you can get those PPMs down really, really low.
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:12.080]  See how low you can get it.
[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:18.120]  Maybe before you start flushing, the first day you flush, measure what comes out.
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:20.520]  Then measure each time and see how low you can get it.
[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:21.720]  Then just keep experimenting.
[02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:25.640]  See how low it goes every day and see how low you can get the PPMs.
[02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:28.880]  I don't want to give any recommendations on how low to try and get it because it's going
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:32.520]  to vary based on your medium and I don't want to fuck up your grow.
[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:34.520]  You're going to have to learn this based on your grow.
[02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:37.560]  Cocoa, you'll get it really low because cocoa is inert.
[02:47:37.560 --> 02:47:39.240]  Cocoa is not going to hold shit.
[02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:40.240]  Same thing with rockwool.
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:44.720]  You'll be able to get the PPMs of your rockwool and your cocoa down to amazingly low levels.
[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:49.280]  Soil, soilless mixes, those are still going to have some high PPMs because they are soil
[02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:50.600]  and soilless mixes.
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:52.520]  There's just a lot of shit in there.
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:53.880]  But play with your runoff.
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:54.940]  Pay attention to that.
[02:47:54.940 --> 02:47:57.240]  See how low you can get it and it'll be a lot of fun.
[02:47:57.240 --> 02:48:01.040]  It'll be a fun experiment and then you'll actually see what's going in and what's coming
[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:02.280]  out of your plants.
[02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:05.840]  Maybe we should just talk about measuring runoff anyway in a full episode.
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:10.000]  We'll talk about checking the EC or the PPMs of a solution before you pour it into your
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:14.280]  plants and then we'll remeasure that same solution, the EC or the PPMs.
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:18.440]  When it comes out of the bottom of your plants and we'll compare that to the pH going in
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:21.880]  and the pH coming out and we'll see what's happening in your rhizosphere.
[02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:23.840]  Anyway, that's a future episode.
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:25.160]  I'm just getting excited.
[02:48:25.160 --> 02:48:29.720]  You guys, measure the electrical conductivity or the particles per million of what's coming
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:33.560]  out of your plant and you will know if you need to flush more or not.
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:36.800]  And then when you cut it down, write down the PPMs and then pay attention.
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:39.440]  And then if you are satisfied, hit that number next time.
[02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:43.220]  And if you're not satisfied, maybe flush a little longer and try to go lower.
[02:48:43.220 --> 02:48:46.060]  But don't be discouraged because it's not all about the flush.
[02:48:46.060 --> 02:48:47.980]  You still have dry and cure to fuck this up.
[02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:50.780]  You could ruin your whole crop after you cut it down.
[02:48:50.780 --> 02:48:55.140]  So ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for listening to my flushing episode.
[02:48:55.140 --> 02:48:59.300]  So far we have done determining ripeness, determining when to flush.
[02:48:59.300 --> 02:49:00.620]  We've talked about flushing.
[02:49:00.620 --> 02:49:04.140]  I think the next episode in line is harvesting.
[02:49:04.140 --> 02:49:07.380]  And then after that, we're going to do the dry and cure episode.
[02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:10.700]  There will be some interruptions to that schedule because I've got an episode scheduled with
[02:49:10.700 --> 02:49:12.780]  some friends and things always pop up.
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:16.460]  But those are on the chart to come up in order.
[02:49:16.460 --> 02:49:18.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate you for listening to my podcast.
[02:49:18.820 --> 02:49:21.180]  Thanks for letting me ramble for so long.
[02:49:21.180 --> 02:49:24.820]  If you felt like this podcast was educational and you learned something and you would like
[02:49:24.820 --> 02:49:28.980]  to contribute to the podcast financially, I would truly appreciate the support.
[02:49:28.980 --> 02:49:34.220]  And you can do so by going to patreon.com slash grow from your heart and all of the
[02:49:34.220 --> 02:49:37.140]  information that you need to sign up will be right there.
[02:49:37.140 --> 02:49:39.640]  It is really simple and I would appreciate the support.
[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:42.140]  I'm not begging for payments or contributions or anything.
[02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:45.380]  I will do this podcast forever for free.
[02:49:45.380 --> 02:49:49.100]  I'm really not trying to get rich off of podcasting, but there are a few people who said they would
[02:49:49.100 --> 02:49:50.980]  like to contribute to the podcast.
[02:49:50.980 --> 02:49:54.260]  I like to make sure there is an opportunity for that.
[02:49:54.260 --> 02:49:57.340]  It is patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[02:49:57.340 --> 02:49:59.820]  What I will do with those funds is I will pay for my website.
[02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:02.900]  You guys, I host this podcast on my website.
[02:50:02.900 --> 02:50:05.460]  It costs a little bit of money to do that every year.
[02:50:05.460 --> 02:50:09.780]  Also, I purchased a better Mac book so that I could record more efficiently.
[02:50:09.780 --> 02:50:13.900]  My old computer was not efficient is the polite way to say it, but the contributions
[02:50:13.900 --> 02:50:17.980]  will help to go pay for the Mac book that I bought and also cover the cost of the website.
[02:50:17.980 --> 02:50:21.740]  Also you may have heard Mike mention that the little microphone cover needed replacement.
[02:50:21.740 --> 02:50:24.500]  I use the funding for things like that.
[02:50:24.500 --> 02:50:26.460]  So if you'd like to contribute, I would appreciate it.
[02:50:26.460 --> 02:50:30.020]  I will quit begging because that got uncomfortable quite quickly.
[02:50:30.020 --> 02:50:33.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, I would love it if you would stalk me on all of the social media.
[02:50:33.460 --> 02:50:34.460]  That is free.
[02:50:34.460 --> 02:50:35.460]  All you got to do is click around.
[02:50:35.460 --> 02:50:36.460]  Find me on Facebook.
[02:50:36.460 --> 02:50:38.660]  Simply search for the grow from your heart podcast.
[02:50:38.660 --> 02:50:39.660]  You can find me on Twitter.
[02:50:39.660 --> 02:50:40.660]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[02:50:40.660 --> 02:50:44.340]  You can find my personal account if you're interested in trolling me.
[02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:46.900]  I'm rostageff420 on Twitter.
[02:50:46.900 --> 02:50:49.420]  Also, you should check me out on Instagram.
[02:50:49.420 --> 02:50:52.060]  I'm irie underscore genetics on Instagram.
[02:50:52.060 --> 02:50:56.700]  I like to do live feeds where I go on Instagram live and I hang out and take a couple of dabs
[02:50:56.700 --> 02:51:01.260]  and then I take questions from the Instagram live feed and I will rant about your question
[02:51:01.260 --> 02:51:04.020]  and teach you how to grow cannabis right there on the spot.
[02:51:04.020 --> 02:51:05.900]  I think it's fun because there's no notes.
[02:51:05.900 --> 02:51:06.900]  There's no preparation.
[02:51:07.140 --> 02:51:10.780]  Today, somebody asked me a fairly in-depth question and I had to stare into the sky and
[02:51:10.780 --> 02:51:14.900]  roll my eyes for about two minutes and try to word out the reply I was trying to give
[02:51:14.900 --> 02:51:16.860]  them because I wasn't prepared.
[02:51:16.860 --> 02:51:18.260]  It's really a lot of fun for me.
[02:51:18.260 --> 02:51:22.980]  It's kind of like a game of stump the grower or stump the breeder or something like that.
[02:51:22.980 --> 02:51:24.780]  I really find it's good for my brain.
[02:51:24.780 --> 02:51:25.780]  It keeps my brain going.
[02:51:25.780 --> 02:51:30.300]  It keeps my growth knowledge on the tip of my tongue and it keeps my brain active.
[02:51:30.300 --> 02:51:33.700]  You guys know that I had a brain injury a few years ago, so I like to do things to keep
[02:51:33.700 --> 02:51:35.540]  my brain going the right direction.
[02:51:36.540 --> 02:51:38.940]  But anyway, I'm fucking ranting today, you guys.
[02:51:38.940 --> 02:51:40.700]  Who needs a quick episode, right?
[02:51:40.700 --> 02:51:41.700]  Find me on Instagram.
[02:51:41.700 --> 02:51:44.300]  I think you would enjoy my Instagram live videos.
[02:51:44.300 --> 02:51:48.060]  Also, why wouldn't you want to check out some dope ass cannabis photography?
[02:51:48.060 --> 02:51:49.060]  Go check it out.
[02:51:49.060 --> 02:51:50.940]  Also, you guys, one more thing.
[02:51:50.940 --> 02:51:51.940]  YouTube.
[02:51:51.940 --> 02:51:54.220]  I have got all of the videos up on YouTube.
[02:51:54.220 --> 02:51:57.980]  You can find every episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast on YouTube now.
[02:51:57.980 --> 02:52:00.260]  Hopefully, we're able to get a larger audience.
[02:52:00.260 --> 02:52:01.260]  We can reach more people.
[02:52:01.260 --> 02:52:03.740]  We can teach more people how to grow better cannabis.
[02:52:03.740 --> 02:52:04.940]  We can dispel more myths.
[02:52:04.940 --> 02:52:07.580]  We can educate more people by having another platform.
[02:52:07.580 --> 02:52:09.380]  So make sure you support the YouTube channel.
[02:52:09.380 --> 02:52:10.380]  Go click subscribe.
[02:52:10.380 --> 02:52:11.380]  Go like some videos.
[02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:13.340]  Go leave some silly comments.
[02:52:13.340 --> 02:52:14.740]  I would appreciate the support.
[02:52:14.740 --> 02:52:16.780]  You guys, I think that's all I've got for you today.
[02:52:16.780 --> 02:52:18.260]  This was a super rambly episode.
[02:52:18.260 --> 02:52:20.180]  I want to thank you guys for hanging out with me.
[02:52:20.180 --> 02:52:23.180]  I want to thank you again for tolerating my raspy, crappy voice.
[02:52:23.180 --> 02:52:24.580]  I feel like I talked it right out.
[02:52:24.580 --> 02:52:28.140]  By the end of the episode, I finally sound pretty decent now that the show is over.
[02:52:28.140 --> 02:52:30.100]  So thanks for tolerating that at the start of the show.
[02:52:30.100 --> 02:52:32.780]  You guys, I'll be back Monday with a fresh new episode.
[02:52:32.820 --> 02:52:35.580]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Texan Toker.
[02:52:35.580 --> 02:52:38.900]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:52:38.900 --> 02:52:39.900]  Tranquility Base here.
[02:52:39.900 --> 02:52:41.580]  The eagle has landed.
