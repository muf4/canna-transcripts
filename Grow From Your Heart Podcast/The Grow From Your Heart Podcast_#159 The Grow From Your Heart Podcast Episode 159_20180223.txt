[00:01.210 --> 00:18.080]  It's time for episode number 159 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:18.080 --> 00:21.080]  You're a source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:21.080 --> 00:22.080]  That's right.
[00:22.080 --> 00:26.080]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[00:26.080 --> 00:30.080]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:30.080 --> 00:34.080]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:34.080 --> 00:35.080]  I'm your host.
[00:35.080 --> 00:36.080]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:36.080 --> 00:37.080]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:37.080 --> 00:38.080]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you to my friends at the Rasta Jeff podcast.
[00:38.080 --> 00:39.080]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.080 --> 00:40.080]  I'll see you next time.
[00:40.080 --> 00:41.080]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.080 --> 00:42.760]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.760 --> 00:46.000]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.880]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.880 --> 00:54.000]  Big shout to Kat, Kud, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is part two of the last episode.
[00:56.440 --> 00:59.840]  I almost said last week's episode, but it'll still be this week because I'm going to put
[00:59.840 --> 01:00.840]  these out back to back.
[01:00.840 --> 01:02.500]  I won't make you wait too long.
[01:02.500 --> 01:03.500]  Just a couple, maybe three days.
[01:03.500 --> 01:04.500]  A little wait.
[01:04.500 --> 01:05.500]  Yeah.
[01:05.500 --> 01:06.680]  Mike is back sitting across the table from me.
[01:06.680 --> 01:08.360]  We just stepped outside for a minute.
[01:08.360 --> 01:09.360]  Mike had a couple of cigarettes.
[01:09.640 --> 01:10.640]  I had one.
[01:10.640 --> 01:11.640]  A cigarette.
[01:11.640 --> 01:12.640]  That was pretty quick.
[01:12.640 --> 01:13.640]  Keeping it quick.
[01:13.640 --> 01:14.640]  Pretty quick.
[01:14.640 --> 01:15.640]  Welcome back.
[01:15.640 --> 01:19.840]  This is actually 158.5, but we're going to call it 159 to keep the feed going.
[01:19.840 --> 01:22.280]  158.5 part two.
[01:22.280 --> 01:23.280]  Some shit like that.
[01:23.280 --> 01:24.280]  Part deer.
[01:24.280 --> 01:25.280]  Yeah.
[01:25.280 --> 01:26.280]  Dude, welcome back.
[01:26.280 --> 01:27.960]  Man, it's getting a little bit chilly out there.
[01:27.960 --> 01:29.960]  Mike and I just hung outside while Mike had a cigarette.
[01:29.960 --> 01:31.360]  It's getting a little bit crispy.
[01:31.360 --> 01:33.960]  I wish I had a hoodie while I was out there.
[01:33.960 --> 01:36.160]  All you outdoor growers, your shit's going to get purple.
[01:36.480 --> 01:37.480]  It's that time of year.
[01:37.480 --> 01:40.480]  Everybody's going to be carrying a jacket around.
[01:40.480 --> 01:43.200]  All my friends that are sleeping outside, they're outdoor grow, I feel for you right
[01:43.200 --> 01:44.200]  now.
[01:44.200 --> 01:45.200]  Yeah.
[01:45.200 --> 01:46.200]  It's not as comfortable as it was last week.
[01:46.200 --> 01:47.200]  Get the heavy bag out.
[01:47.200 --> 01:48.200]  Yeah.
[01:48.200 --> 01:49.200]  You're going to have to start a campfire or some shit.
[01:49.200 --> 01:50.800]  I hope you got your dog out there keeping you warm.
[01:50.800 --> 01:51.800]  No campfire.
[01:51.800 --> 01:52.800]  No campfire?
[01:52.800 --> 01:53.800]  Light.
[01:53.800 --> 01:54.800]  Light.
[01:54.800 --> 01:55.800]  Plants.
[01:55.800 --> 01:56.800]  I don't know.
[01:56.800 --> 01:57.800]  I don't know.
[01:57.800 --> 01:58.800]  I don't know.
[01:58.800 --> 01:59.800]  Is that light?
[01:59.800 --> 02:00.800]  It's light.
[02:00.800 --> 02:01.800]  Is that the right kind of light?
[02:01.800 --> 02:02.800]  It's the right kind of light.
[02:02.800 --> 02:03.800]  I really don't know.
[02:03.800 --> 02:04.800]  All right.
[02:04.800 --> 02:05.800]  Hopefully you're warm outside.
[02:06.440 --> 02:09.440]  Hopefully you're listening to this while you're trimming down your outdoor crops.
[02:09.440 --> 02:10.440]  It's just about croptober.
[02:10.440 --> 02:11.440]  It's outdoor season.
[02:11.440 --> 02:12.440]  It's time to harvest.
[02:12.440 --> 02:13.440]  It's dependent on where you're living.
[02:13.440 --> 02:14.440]  They're coming down now.
[02:14.440 --> 02:15.440]  And what strain you're growing.
[02:15.440 --> 02:16.440]  If you got some flow or some blueberry, it might be a time.
[02:16.440 --> 02:20.120]  If they're not coming down while you're listening to this, you better be flushing.
[02:20.120 --> 02:21.120]  Or watching.
[02:21.120 --> 02:22.120]  Yeah, flushing for sure.
[02:22.120 --> 02:23.120]  All right.
[02:23.120 --> 02:24.760]  Let's put this train wreck of a podcast back on some rails.
[02:24.760 --> 02:27.040]  We're only two minutes and 30 seconds in and we're already rambling.
[02:27.040 --> 02:30.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is part two of an episode that we did a few, actually we
[02:30.320 --> 02:31.440]  recorded it like an hour ago.
[02:31.440 --> 02:34.040]  You heard it a few days ago.
[02:34.040 --> 02:37.320]  There was an email and it started off with questions for Mike and then there was a part
[02:37.320 --> 02:42.080]  two that had questions about going from a basement grow into a large facility.
[02:42.080 --> 02:43.480]  So let me catch you up on the email.
[02:43.480 --> 02:45.080]  I'll read it all the way from the beginning.
[02:45.080 --> 02:47.400]  It says, hey, what's up, Rasta Jeff, huge fan of the podcast.
[02:47.400 --> 02:51.240]  As I've said before, I had a few questions I thought could be a podcast.
[02:51.240 --> 02:55.120]  I'm in Michigan and we just passed three bills pushing us into a seed to sale system based
[02:55.120 --> 02:56.600]  on Colorado system.
[02:56.600 --> 03:00.200]  I was wondering if you and white Mike could touch on the subject.
[03:00.200 --> 03:04.920]  Like how do I go about finding out information from the city about how many licensed facilities
[03:04.920 --> 03:06.640]  they will allow?
[03:06.640 --> 03:08.600]  That part we handled on the last episode.
[03:08.600 --> 03:09.840]  I hope you listen to it.
[03:09.840 --> 03:13.960]  If not, press pause, go back, listen to number one 58 and check it out.
[03:13.960 --> 03:15.720]  Then come back and see us.
[03:15.720 --> 03:20.120]  So the second part of the question, what we're going to address today, he says, what is the
[03:20.120 --> 03:23.360]  biggest hurdle going from a basement grow to a warehouse?
[03:23.360 --> 03:26.240]  I know you've recently made the switch from soil to cocoa.
[03:26.240 --> 03:27.560]  Any advice on that transition?
[03:27.920 --> 03:30.840]  Then he also says, I'm planning on using veg bloom.
[03:30.840 --> 03:35.320]  I'm already in the basement, but do you add anything else to their line as well?
[03:35.320 --> 03:39.400]  What are some things you didn't expect going to a large scale and any other advice you
[03:39.400 --> 03:43.040]  think one would need to know about taking the leap into the big leagues?
[03:43.040 --> 03:45.480]  And he says, thanks for such a great podcast.
[03:45.480 --> 03:47.640]  I hope you can answer some questions for me.
[03:47.640 --> 03:49.080]  We already answered half of it.
[03:49.080 --> 03:50.560]  Let's get into the second half of it.
[03:50.560 --> 03:51.760]  The part where I need to jump in.
[03:51.760 --> 03:54.880]  Hey, Mike, thanks for doing such a great job with the first half of this dude's question.
[03:54.880 --> 03:56.440]  You really fucking nailed it for him.
[03:56.440 --> 03:57.440]  Thanks, man.
[03:57.440 --> 03:59.600]  I hope I, I hope I answered your question.
[03:59.600 --> 04:04.400]  If you need a further elaboration on any point, hit me up on social media.
[04:04.400 --> 04:05.400]  Please do.
[04:05.400 --> 04:06.560]  We love hearing from all of you, from everybody.
[04:06.560 --> 04:08.360]  I love listener generated content.
[04:08.360 --> 04:09.840]  This is an amazing question.
[04:09.840 --> 04:13.000]  So when we had to do a two-parter episode to answer it, you can send me your emails.
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.560]  You guys, it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[04:14.560 --> 04:16.040]  I'm going to get into the question.
[04:16.040 --> 04:19.960]  It goes, if I didn't say like last episode, thanks again for the killer question.
[04:19.960 --> 04:20.960]  Yes.
[04:20.960 --> 04:21.960]  Thank you.
[04:21.960 --> 04:22.960]  Thanks.
[04:22.960 --> 04:23.960]  Yeah, this is a great question.
[04:23.960 --> 04:24.960]  Uh, we've, we've gotten normal.
[04:24.960 --> 04:26.040]  We're going to get two hours worth of content out of this question.
[04:26.040 --> 04:28.440]  He says, um, where is it?
[04:28.440 --> 04:32.440]  What is the biggest hurdle going from a basement grow to a warehouse?
[04:32.440 --> 04:34.440]  There are a lot of things to think about there.
[04:34.440 --> 04:38.840]  One of the biggest things that I noticed was different was the airflow.
[04:38.840 --> 04:43.520]  Um, a large building, the air doesn't flow like it does in a small room.
[04:43.520 --> 04:47.440]  You can change the air out in a small bedroom in a matter of minutes with a small blower,
[04:47.440 --> 04:49.680]  a large room, you're going to have hotspots.
[04:49.680 --> 04:50.760]  You're going to have cool spots.
[04:50.760 --> 04:51.960]  You're going to find humid spots.
[04:51.960 --> 04:56.520]  You're going to need to learn how to control that temperature and that humidity all throughout
[04:56.520 --> 04:57.640]  a large room.
[04:57.640 --> 05:04.000]  It's the scale of the increases where every, I mean, many legal retailers and production
[05:04.000 --> 05:10.160]  facilities are still problem shooting their, their multimillion dollar grows because the
[05:10.160 --> 05:15.640]  difference in scope from a basement grow or a smaller grow to a huge warehouse is, is
[05:15.640 --> 05:16.640]  monumental.
[05:16.640 --> 05:20.760]  A good, reliable HVAC company in Colorado that will come work on a grow and knows what
[05:20.760 --> 05:24.800]  they're doing, uh, will make you wait three months just to come give you an estimate because
[05:24.800 --> 05:27.400]  they are so backed up with cannabis grows right now.
[05:27.400 --> 05:33.680]  Um, if, if I had enough money to do anything I wanted cannabis business wise, I would build
[05:33.680 --> 05:35.000]  from the ground up.
[05:35.000 --> 05:41.440]  Um, because I've seen what so many companies have had to go through attempting to improve
[05:41.440 --> 05:46.200]  an existing structure, um, to, to where it's not giving them problems.
[05:46.200 --> 05:51.080]  I know so many people that, I mean, they thought they had everything under control
[05:51.080 --> 05:56.240]  and then as the season started to change, one whole wall was, uh, the temperature change
[05:56.240 --> 06:00.320]  in that wall was causing major problems in a grow.
[06:00.320 --> 06:04.200]  Um, I mean, and that's not a unique problem that happened to a lot of people.
[06:04.200 --> 06:09.520]  If you're one wall, you're whichever, whichever side gets the most sun or the least sun, it
[06:09.520 --> 06:13.040]  just kind of depends on your environment when the seasons change in Colorado.
[06:13.040 --> 06:16.240]  But you'll usually see in a grow that you've never been in before.
[06:16.240 --> 06:20.120]  You have to find out where the powdery mildew is going to happen when the first winter comes.
[06:20.120 --> 06:23.120]  You just got to find out where it's going to happen because it probably will.
[06:23.120 --> 06:27.360]  If you, if you haven't designed your room flawlessly, you're on one wall, you're probably
[06:27.360 --> 06:30.680]  going to get, if you've got an exterior wall, you're going to get powdery mildew there when
[06:30.680 --> 06:31.680]  the season changes.
[06:31.680 --> 06:38.400]  You and I can problem shoot a basement grow or a bedroom grow in like 20 minutes, an hour
[06:38.400 --> 06:39.400]  or two.
[06:39.400 --> 06:44.080]  Uh, I mean, and by troubleshoot, I mean like find the problems and suggest easy ways to
[06:44.080 --> 06:45.080]  fix them.
[06:45.080 --> 06:48.640]  Well, I can walk into like a basement grow and point out 10 things in 10 seconds that
[06:48.640 --> 06:50.800]  we can improve your grow and make it more efficient.
[06:50.800 --> 06:54.840]  In a warehouse grow, part of it's just putting in the time, right.
[06:54.840 --> 07:00.200]  Um, to get through the cycle, where your huge heating and cooling, a lot of people don't
[07:00.200 --> 07:02.440]  aim for enough cooling.
[07:02.440 --> 07:05.200]  They don't think they're going to need enough cooling and then they put plenty of cooling
[07:05.200 --> 07:07.080]  or they don't think about enough air flow.
[07:07.080 --> 07:09.160]  You have to evacuate humidity out of there.
[07:09.920 --> 07:13.040]  I know outfits that spent more on AC units than they did on building.
[07:13.040 --> 07:14.040]  I know that place.
[07:14.040 --> 07:15.040]  Like on the building.
[07:15.040 --> 07:16.040]  No, I know that place.
[07:16.040 --> 07:17.040]  Yeah.
[07:17.040 --> 07:18.040]  I know, I know where you're at.
[07:18.040 --> 07:19.040]  Yeah.
[07:19.040 --> 07:20.040]  I know that place.
[07:20.040 --> 07:21.040]  It's not one outfit in Colorado.
[07:21.040 --> 07:22.040]  I'm sure that's true for a half dozen or more.
[07:22.040 --> 07:23.680]  I just happen to know the one.
[07:23.680 --> 07:26.040]  So the airflow is going to be a huge thing.
[07:26.040 --> 07:28.240]  Also, you're going to be feeding on a much larger scale.
[07:28.240 --> 07:29.680]  Are you going to build a drip system?
[07:29.680 --> 07:31.600]  Are you going to be watering by hand?
[07:31.600 --> 07:34.640]  Every time you run that drip system, you're creating more humidity in the room that you're
[07:34.640 --> 07:35.720]  going to have to deal with.
[07:35.720 --> 07:38.200]  Every time you water by hand, there's going to be more humidity.
[07:38.240 --> 07:39.240]  Do you have a drain?
[07:39.240 --> 07:40.240]  Do you have a floor drain?
[07:40.240 --> 07:43.240]  That's something I would definitely look for if you're moving into a new building.
[07:43.240 --> 07:44.560]  A floor drain.
[07:44.560 --> 07:47.640]  Treating water is a huge deal.
[07:47.640 --> 07:48.640]  Treating water.
[07:48.640 --> 07:52.560]  You're going to have, if you're moving into a warehouse, at the Green and Healthy Warehouse,
[07:52.560 --> 07:56.000]  we used about a thousand gallons of water every other day-ish.
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.400]  You're going to need to treat that somehow.
[07:57.400 --> 08:02.080]  I would recommend a really nice reverse osmosis machine because something I noticed was we
[08:02.080 --> 08:04.120]  were using the water that came from the municipality.
[08:04.120 --> 08:06.040]  No more buckets and bubblers?
[08:06.040 --> 08:07.040]  Oh my gosh.
[08:08.040 --> 08:12.280]  The scale is what we're getting at here, guys.
[08:12.280 --> 08:18.760]  When you're talking about a basement grow, you're talking about one employee, you're
[08:18.760 --> 08:21.200]  talking about a thousand dollars worth of equipment.
[08:21.200 --> 08:24.840]  A little warehouse, you multiply those numbers by a hundred.
[08:24.840 --> 08:25.840]  Right.
[08:25.840 --> 08:27.560]  Well, we were using, let me get back into this part.
[08:27.560 --> 08:30.960]  We were using the municipal water from Colorado Springs.
[08:30.960 --> 08:34.920]  As the temperature would change, the smell of the water would change.
[08:34.920 --> 08:36.920]  I could smell chlorine in it on some days.
[08:37.000 --> 08:38.960]  I could smell other things on some days.
[08:38.960 --> 08:41.200]  I would do a simple pH test.
[08:41.200 --> 08:43.080]  On some days, the pH would be seven.
[08:43.080 --> 08:44.080]  Some days it would be nine.
[08:44.080 --> 08:46.880]  It would just be days apart from that.
[08:46.880 --> 08:49.000]  Then I would do PPM tests.
[08:49.000 --> 08:50.480]  Sometimes it'd be really high.
[08:50.480 --> 08:52.280]  Sometimes it would be really, really low.
[08:52.280 --> 08:54.120]  We're feeding cocoa.
[08:54.120 --> 08:55.120]  Our plants are in cocoa.
[08:55.120 --> 09:00.360]  It was really hard to predict what water you're going to get tomorrow or the next day or the
[09:00.360 --> 09:01.360]  next day.
[09:01.360 --> 09:04.200]  An RO machine would really be really helpful in a large grow.
[09:04.200 --> 09:06.960]  That's something I would highly recommend because you're going to need clean water.
[09:06.960 --> 09:08.720]  You're going to need a lot of it.
[09:08.720 --> 09:13.480]  Have more RO water than you think you're going to need available because if you get too much
[09:13.480 --> 09:14.480]  heat, something goes on, you're going to need extra water.
[09:14.480 --> 09:16.320]  That's anywhere in the country.
[09:16.320 --> 09:19.640]  Guaranteed there's stuff in your municipal water that you do not want to feed to your
[09:19.640 --> 09:22.400]  plants or through your watering system.
[09:22.400 --> 09:23.400]  Bugs.
[09:23.400 --> 09:28.120]  If you get a problem like bugs or powdery mildew, you're going to have a larger problem
[09:28.120 --> 09:31.880]  than you have ever thought of having because hopefully you're running a perpetual grow
[09:31.880 --> 09:35.560]  if you've got a large system and you're going to have plants that are in full flower at
[09:35.560 --> 09:37.800]  the end of flower and you can't treat those for bugs.
[09:37.800 --> 09:42.520]  So be highly prepared for pests and pathogens and powdery mildew.
[09:42.520 --> 09:43.520]  Be on the lookout.
[09:43.520 --> 09:45.160]  Be ahead of that.
[09:45.160 --> 09:50.040]  Don't bring anybody into that grow unless it is absolutely necessary.
[09:50.040 --> 09:53.600]  You have to get clones from somewhere, but when clones come in, quarantine them, treat
[09:53.600 --> 09:55.440]  the shit out of them, almost kill them.
[09:55.440 --> 09:58.520]  You're treating them so hard for pests and mold because you don't want to bring any of
[09:58.520 --> 09:59.520]  that stuff in.
[09:59.760 --> 10:05.320]  I know a lot of facilities that have just, they've given up trying to treat clones and
[10:05.320 --> 10:07.600]  they're seed only now.
[10:07.600 --> 10:10.280]  I know a few outfits that have just given up entirely.
[10:10.280 --> 10:14.480]  And I know a lot of home growers that are, that that's been their policy since the last
[10:14.480 --> 10:17.680]  time they got a gift clone.
[10:17.680 --> 10:23.480]  Scheduling and getting everything on track in a big grow is a challenge in the beginning
[10:23.480 --> 10:26.480]  unless you're a guy like myself that is kind of OCD.
[10:26.480 --> 10:29.320]  So you're going to need to get a good schedule happening.
[10:30.120 --> 10:32.120]  You're going to need to get veg plants.
[10:32.120 --> 10:33.760]  Then you're going to need flowering plants.
[10:33.760 --> 10:36.800]  Then you're going to need clones and you're going to need to keep in mind that these flowering
[10:36.800 --> 10:40.920]  plants are going to be done in this amount of time and I need this many veg plants to
[10:40.920 --> 10:44.040]  replace them immediately because you do not want downtime.
[10:44.040 --> 10:49.720]  And that's going to kind of segue me into something that I can really rant about personally.
[10:49.720 --> 10:55.400]  The hugest caveat of going from the basement to a warehouse grow is often the relationship
[10:55.400 --> 10:58.520]  between the money person and the actual grower.
[10:58.720 --> 11:01.200]  Oftentimes there's a middleman.
[11:01.200 --> 11:03.840]  You're going to have an investor, you're going to have an owner, and you're going to have
[11:03.840 --> 11:04.840]  a grower.
[11:04.840 --> 11:07.840]  I'm not sure which position you're planning on taking.
[11:07.840 --> 11:12.320]  Please get all of those people on the same page because I see a lot of grows fail because
[11:12.320 --> 11:19.080]  an investor throws down money and he wants money back in fucking 60 days because you're
[11:19.080 --> 11:20.980]  growing weed, where's my money?
[11:20.980 --> 11:25.440]  And then you've got an owner that's rubbing his balls to keep him off you for a little
[11:25.440 --> 11:27.680]  while and he's like, give me 120 days.
[11:27.840 --> 11:31.120]  And so now the owner will say, how long do you need to grow this crop?
[11:31.120 --> 11:36.040]  And I know that the crops that I'm trying to grow take me, I'm going to say 150 days.
[11:36.040 --> 11:37.040]  This is hypothetical.
[11:37.040 --> 11:39.360]  I need 150 days to make this crop happen.
[11:39.360 --> 11:42.600]  The owner of that facility is going to look you dead in the face and go, cool, I'll see
[11:42.600 --> 11:45.000]  you in 120 days and it should be done.
[11:45.000 --> 11:46.760]  And now you're saying to yourself, these are fucking plants.
[11:46.760 --> 11:49.380]  I can't cut 30 days off of this cycle.
[11:49.380 --> 11:50.380]  There's no way it's going to happen.
[11:50.380 --> 11:54.520]  So you've got an owner bitching or a investor bitching at an owner, an owner yelling at
[11:54.520 --> 11:58.600]  a grower, a grower that wants to do the absolute best he can for these plants because that's
[11:58.600 --> 11:59.880]  where the passion is.
[11:59.880 --> 12:01.480]  But the owner has got to make money.
[12:01.480 --> 12:02.480]  He's got to return the investment.
[12:02.480 --> 12:05.420]  And then you've got an investor that only cares about the money.
[12:05.420 --> 12:11.160]  So the hardest part of a commercial grow is getting all of your people on the same page.
[12:11.160 --> 12:14.360]  You need your owner, your investor, your master grower.
[12:14.360 --> 12:16.080]  Then you need whoever else you've got in there.
[12:16.080 --> 12:20.360]  If you've got somebody working the bedroom and the flower room, those two people need
[12:20.360 --> 12:22.580]  to have a meeting every couple of days.
[12:22.640 --> 12:27.740]  If you've got a trim crew, your master grower and your assistant grower and your trim crew
[12:27.740 --> 12:29.660]  leader all need to communicate.
[12:29.660 --> 12:31.460]  You need to know what plants are coming down.
[12:31.460 --> 12:35.100]  You need to know how long you have to trim this until there's more plants so that you
[12:35.100 --> 12:37.780]  can schedule for the trimmers to be there.
[12:37.780 --> 12:39.500]  Those are some of the things that you may overlook.
[12:39.500 --> 12:45.420]  It's just so the scale and the scope are so much more complicated than a basement grow.
[12:45.420 --> 12:48.980]  I mean, with a basement grow, you're getting ready to harvest.
[12:48.980 --> 12:53.500]  You check out your plants every couple of days for a week.
[12:53.500 --> 12:56.500]  When they get to where you want them, you just start harvesting.
[12:56.500 --> 12:58.480]  Maybe you call a buddy.
[12:58.480 --> 13:01.600]  Maybe you make a little plan and have two friends coming over.
[13:01.600 --> 13:05.580]  When you're talking about an industrial scale, you're talking about 15 or 20 people that
[13:05.580 --> 13:10.420]  need to be scheduled, paid, W2ed, trained.
[13:10.420 --> 13:14.180]  I believe two or three people could run...
[13:14.180 --> 13:17.860]  One or two people can run 100 light grow sufficiently.
[13:17.860 --> 13:18.860]  Two or three people...
[13:18.860 --> 13:19.860]  ... until harvest.
[13:19.860 --> 13:22.060]  Right, but when it comes time to trim, then you need a small trim crew.
[13:22.060 --> 13:23.260]  You need five or six people.
[13:23.260 --> 13:25.460]  That's when you need that trim crew manager.
[13:25.460 --> 13:29.300]  Maybe that assistant grower now becomes also the trim crew manager, but you're going to
[13:29.300 --> 13:32.360]  need somebody that can delegate, somebody that can...
[13:32.360 --> 13:35.860]  You need a director that can direct the facility, that can direct the employees, that knows
[13:35.860 --> 13:37.980]  about the plants, that knows about people.
[13:37.980 --> 13:42.140]  And then you need, like I said in the last episode, a lawyer and an accountant.
[13:42.140 --> 13:45.180]  Those are some things that you're definitely going to need in a larger grow that you didn't
[13:45.180 --> 13:48.380]  think as much about in the other grow.
[13:48.380 --> 13:53.340]  Also, shit goes wrong every day in a large scale grow.
[13:53.340 --> 13:59.780]  Well, and a lot of times investors don't necessarily know any of that, which is where a lot of
[13:59.780 --> 14:04.460]  headaches and a lot of partnerships break up is the money man doesn't know anything
[14:04.460 --> 14:05.740]  about marijuana.
[14:05.740 --> 14:09.060]  And so he doesn't realize that something so simple is...
[14:09.060 --> 14:13.540]  When we were doing trimmer interviews, we walked like a dude through the grow and we
[14:13.540 --> 14:17.300]  think he gave us thrips.
[14:17.300 --> 14:23.500]  And that's why this crop is a third smaller than it should be.
[14:23.500 --> 14:28.320]  Like there's stuff that comes up because you're dealing with plant growth and you're dealing
[14:28.320 --> 14:38.620]  with a live plant in a medium where mistakes can mean millions in lost revenue or delays.
[14:38.620 --> 14:40.060]  We really can't get it out enough.
[14:40.060 --> 14:42.980]  The scope is so much different.
[14:42.980 --> 14:46.260]  The attitude and the skill sets are different.
[14:46.260 --> 14:51.420]  One of the biggest traits for a basement grower is secrecy.
[14:51.420 --> 14:54.620]  The ability to hide and stay hidden.
[14:54.620 --> 14:59.700]  That keeps people with shotguns away from your door, whether they be law enforcement
[14:59.700 --> 15:01.660]  or rippers.
[15:01.660 --> 15:04.880]  That's one of the biggest skill sets you can have as a basement grower.
[15:04.880 --> 15:10.220]  As a legal marijuana business owner, you need to be very out front, loud and proud about
[15:10.380 --> 15:15.140]  what you do, how you do it, and the fact that you love to follow the rules.
[15:15.140 --> 15:19.260]  I love to follow the rules and I make sure all of my employees love to follow the rules.
[15:19.260 --> 15:20.580]  It needs to become your mantra.
[15:20.580 --> 15:24.580]  And you need to get used to saying it in front of TV cameras, especially if you want to be
[15:24.580 --> 15:28.220]  one of the first marijuana business owners in your area.
[15:28.220 --> 15:32.620]  In Colorado, we have somebody that's known as a compliance officer and his only job is
[15:32.620 --> 15:34.820]  to make sure that you're following all of the rules.
[15:34.820 --> 15:36.420]  He gets emails from...
[15:36.420 --> 15:38.780]  Here we have the MED, the Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[15:38.780 --> 15:42.380]  He gets emails from them every day saying, did you know that this is a new rule?
[15:42.380 --> 15:43.380]  This is a new rule.
[15:43.380 --> 15:48.540]  And it's his job to go, whether it's the retail or the grow or the extraction facility, it's
[15:48.540 --> 15:51.340]  his job to get the employees together and say, this is the rule.
[15:51.340 --> 15:53.660]  And he has to oversee that that happens.
[15:53.660 --> 15:57.380]  The rule changes like that are frequent here in Colorado.
[15:57.380 --> 16:03.780]  And until nationwide, we really get legalization handed out or hammered out.
[16:03.780 --> 16:06.380]  They'll be common in your area too.
[16:06.380 --> 16:08.460]  So yeah, be ready.
[16:09.380 --> 16:14.060]  In the past, I'm sure that we did an entire episode on going from a basement grow to a
[16:14.060 --> 16:15.060]  large scale grow.
[16:15.060 --> 16:17.220]  I'm pretty sure that we did an entire episode on that.
[16:17.220 --> 16:19.340]  I will leave that in the show notes.
[16:19.340 --> 16:20.660]  There'll be a link to that in the show notes.
[16:20.660 --> 16:25.540]  Or if you go to the website, IREADGENETICSCOLORADO.COM and scroll through the shows, I'm sure you'll
[16:25.540 --> 16:27.020]  be able to find it on there.
[16:27.020 --> 16:30.820]  I cannot recall the episode number right now and I do not want to scroll through old episodes
[16:30.820 --> 16:32.240]  while we're recording.
[16:32.240 --> 16:33.460]  So look for that.
[16:33.460 --> 16:37.100]  It's a whole episode about moving from a basement grow to a large scale grow.
[16:37.100 --> 16:41.660]  One of the things that we haven't really hit that you have available now that wasn't
[16:41.660 --> 16:49.180]  available to us when we started this is you can come to Colorado now and hire a consultant
[16:49.180 --> 16:56.860]  or go visit a couple of legal businesses and see how they do it and get an idea of what's
[16:56.860 --> 17:00.700]  going to be required of you and where you want to go.
[17:00.700 --> 17:06.220]  And I know a number of people out here in Colorado have been hired to travel out to
[17:06.340 --> 17:10.020]  other states and help people navigate some of the things like planning out warehouse
[17:10.020 --> 17:11.020]  grows.
[17:11.020 --> 17:14.860]  I mean, just the logistics that go into these things will blow your mind.
[17:14.860 --> 17:20.940]  The amount of cooling that's required for a one-story warehouse grow is typically greater
[17:20.940 --> 17:23.380]  than like a 30-story office building.
[17:23.380 --> 17:27.300]  I mean, the amount of equipment that's necessary is just insane.
[17:27.300 --> 17:30.940]  Learning how to maintain all of that equipment.
[17:30.940 --> 17:31.940]  We're talking about pot growers.
[17:31.940 --> 17:33.860]  They know how to grow pot.
[17:33.860 --> 17:38.220]  The amount of information that needs to be learned and adapted to is monumental.
[17:38.220 --> 17:42.300]  That's something that I quickly learned is I'm not just a pot grower anymore.
[17:42.300 --> 17:44.900]  I learned how to build drip systems with PVC.
[17:44.900 --> 17:46.140]  I learned how to work on pumps.
[17:46.140 --> 17:47.620]  I learned how to work on air conditioning.
[17:47.620 --> 17:49.740]  I learned how to work on dehumidifiers.
[17:49.740 --> 17:51.740]  Now I know how to work on the security camera system.
[17:51.740 --> 17:54.180]  Now I know how to build shit that I never thought I would.
[17:54.180 --> 17:57.780]  And it's just all because I went and helped with a giant commercial facility and I learned
[17:57.780 --> 18:00.620]  a ton of things.
[18:00.620 --> 18:04.060]  You need such a varied skillset because little things that don't have anything to do with
[18:04.060 --> 18:08.460]  growing marijuana can affect your legal ability to do so.
[18:08.460 --> 18:14.980]  If you see a camera down in the grow and you ignore it, you might get hit with a compliance
[18:14.980 --> 18:22.740]  violation because that camera was down for an extra half day and have your business shut
[18:22.740 --> 18:23.740]  down.
[18:23.740 --> 18:24.740]  I mean, it's just as simple as that.
[18:24.740 --> 18:25.740]  Quickly.
[18:25.740 --> 18:26.740]  Quickly.
[18:26.740 --> 18:27.740]  All right.
[18:27.740 --> 18:28.740]  So he's got more parts to this question.
[18:28.860 --> 18:30.660]  I'm going to read it because the last episode got long that way.
[18:30.660 --> 18:32.500]  Did I just say harp on it?
[18:32.500 --> 18:34.140]  Jeez, how old am I getting?
[18:34.140 --> 18:38.100]  So he also said, I know you've recently made the switch from soil to cocoa.
[18:38.100 --> 18:41.020]  Any advice on that transition?
[18:41.020 --> 18:44.260]  He also says, I'm planning on running veg bloom and I'm already in a basement, but do
[18:44.260 --> 18:49.020]  you add anything else to the veg bloom line as well?
[18:49.020 --> 18:51.580]  So that's kind of a multi-part question there.
[18:51.580 --> 18:53.300]  I've made the switch from soil to cocoa.
[18:53.300 --> 18:54.820]  Any advice on that transition?
[18:54.820 --> 18:55.820]  Yes.
[18:55.820 --> 18:59.820]  So I use an easy cloner and I take my clones from the easy cloner and I put them into solo
[18:59.820 --> 19:00.820]  cups.
[19:00.820 --> 19:04.180]  The solo cups have got holes in the bottom of them so that they can drain plenty of water
[19:04.180 --> 19:05.740]  and the water doesn't get stuck in there.
[19:05.740 --> 19:11.780]  I usually fill the cups with an aerated soil, something like Fox farms, either ocean forest
[19:11.780 --> 19:12.980]  or the happy frog.
[19:12.980 --> 19:17.700]  And then I put the clones into there and then I water them with my desired nutrient solution.
[19:17.700 --> 19:23.420]  I did so this time, but I used cocoa instead of the aerated soil and 50% of my clones died.
[19:23.420 --> 19:25.300]  They fucking hated going into cocoa.
[19:25.300 --> 19:27.180]  They were not happy about that.
[19:27.180 --> 19:29.840]  The cocoa seems to have compressed and smothered them.
[19:29.840 --> 19:33.740]  They did not get a chance to get their legs and they got crushed and killed.
[19:33.740 --> 19:37.700]  So my thought on that is put your clones into soil if that's what you're doing because they
[19:37.700 --> 19:39.140]  did not like the cocoa.
[19:39.140 --> 19:42.420]  Go into cups of dirt, put those cups of dirt into the cocoa in the future.
[19:42.420 --> 19:44.980]  That's what I've learned because my plants were really, really pissed off.
[19:44.980 --> 19:49.260]  And you can go dirt clones to cocoa plants easy enough, huh?
[19:49.260 --> 19:50.260]  Oh yeah.
[19:50.260 --> 19:51.260]  They just drop them right in there.
[19:51.260 --> 19:52.260]  They love it.
[19:52.260 --> 19:53.260]  You just got to give it time to...
[19:53.260 --> 19:54.820]  But they don't mind that transition once those roots strengthen up a bit, huh?
[19:55.340 --> 19:56.340]  Yeah.
[19:56.340 --> 19:57.340]  Couldn't even know.
[19:57.340 --> 20:00.940]  All the weight of the water in that cocoa compressed the cocoa real tight on those new
[20:00.940 --> 20:03.180]  roots and they just got crushed in there.
[20:03.180 --> 20:04.820]  So that's one thing that I learned.
[20:04.820 --> 20:09.320]  Also, you can water a whole heck of a lot more.
[20:09.320 --> 20:11.300]  You can feed more frequently is what I think I'm trying to say.
[20:11.300 --> 20:12.300]  I'm sorry.
[20:12.300 --> 20:13.300]  You can't water a lot more.
[20:13.300 --> 20:14.300]  You can feed a heck of a lot more.
[20:14.300 --> 20:18.740]  When I was running soil, I would feed maybe twice a week.
[20:18.740 --> 20:22.900]  Now every time I am watering the plants, they are getting nutrients.
[20:22.980 --> 20:27.020]  So three, maybe four times a week, these plants are getting nutrients and they don't show
[20:27.020 --> 20:29.060]  any signs of burn and they are growing vigorously.
[20:29.060 --> 20:31.780]  Is that the cocoa not holding your nudes as well?
[20:31.780 --> 20:32.780]  Right.
[20:32.780 --> 20:33.900]  The cocoa, it doesn't hold on at all.
[20:33.900 --> 20:35.980]  The nutrients just slide right out of there.
[20:35.980 --> 20:39.020]  So then you don't get as much burn and you can feed more frequently.
[20:39.020 --> 20:40.020]  It'll eat what it wants.
[20:40.020 --> 20:42.820]  Better for your plants, but not your wallet.
[20:42.820 --> 20:45.220]  Well, maybe in the end it'll pay for it.
[20:45.220 --> 20:47.660]  I'm thinking if it's going to eat that much, there's going to be that much more weight
[20:47.660 --> 20:50.100]  that'll make up for it, which isn't a bad thing.
[20:50.100 --> 20:51.320]  Time to do some math.
[20:51.320 --> 20:55.200]  I'm thinking, I don't know if I'm convinced on a hundred percent cocoa.
[20:55.200 --> 21:03.040]  I may start doing a 50% soilless mix, like a honestly not an expensive soil, something
[21:03.040 --> 21:06.960]  like Roots Organic or maybe even Tupper or the Fox Farm Ocean Forest wouldn't hurt my
[21:06.960 --> 21:07.960]  feelings.
[21:07.960 --> 21:11.360]  A 50% mix with the soilless mix and cocoa.
[21:11.360 --> 21:12.360]  Put the cocoa in there.
[21:12.360 --> 21:16.600]  I know a couple of people that started doing that a while ago and they all seem to rave
[21:16.600 --> 21:17.600]  about it.
[21:17.600 --> 21:18.600]  Yeah.
[21:18.600 --> 21:19.600]  I think that I'm going to try that next.
[21:20.320 --> 21:24.960]  I'll run one light with the cocoa, one light with the soil, and then one light with the
[21:24.960 --> 21:28.240]  cocoa soil mix and we'll see what happens.
[21:28.240 --> 21:31.800]  That's something I feel about the soil to cocoa switch.
[21:31.800 --> 21:36.560]  Also, I've noticed if I overwater, they take really long to dry out and the plants will
[21:36.560 --> 21:37.960]  kind of slow down.
[21:37.960 --> 21:41.800]  I thought that I could water the shit out of them with the cocoa, but I've noticed that
[21:41.800 --> 21:43.000]  I want some aeration in there.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.160]  If I overwater them, they really start to get stacked in.
[21:45.160 --> 21:46.880]  The plants really like that aeration.
[21:46.880 --> 21:47.880]  They do.
[21:47.880 --> 21:48.880]  They like air.
[21:49.360 --> 21:52.040]  I think that right when they start to dry out is when they really take off with the
[21:52.040 --> 21:53.160]  most explosive growth.
[21:53.160 --> 21:54.440]  They're getting kind of dry.
[21:54.440 --> 22:01.600]  I've only ever seen one good aeroponic system in motion and I was blown away with this dude's
[22:01.600 --> 22:03.160]  timelines.
[22:03.160 --> 22:07.480]  The next part of his question, he said, I'm planning on running Veg Bloom.
[22:07.480 --> 22:11.160]  And then he said, do you add anything else to their line as well?
[22:11.160 --> 22:12.160]  Yes.
[22:12.160 --> 22:16.800]  Actually, I've got a screenshot here of a conversation I had with a rep from Veg Bloom
[22:16.800 --> 22:20.040]  and he says, this is what we are recommended to use.
[22:20.040 --> 22:28.040]  He said four to five grams of base nutrient per gallon in veg, five grams per gallon in
[22:28.040 --> 22:29.040]  flour.
[22:29.040 --> 22:30.040]  So you've got your base nutrient.
[22:30.040 --> 22:34.560]  It's probably the HD or the RO or the dirty, whichever one they selected for you.
[22:34.560 --> 22:37.440]  Hopefully you had a consultation with them and had your water checked out because if
[22:37.440 --> 22:41.480]  you get your water tested, send them water test results, they will recommend a base nutrient
[22:41.480 --> 22:42.480]  for you.
[22:42.480 --> 22:47.120]  So four to five grams of base per veg or per gallon in veg, five grams per gallon in your
[22:47.120 --> 22:48.120]  flowering stage.
[22:48.120 --> 22:53.120]  Then he says a half of gram per gallon of plus life once a week.
[22:53.120 --> 22:55.000]  And that's their rooting inoculate, the plus life.
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.440]  I really like that stuff.
[22:57.440 --> 23:02.620]  Half a gram per gallon of plus life once a week through veg and flour, and then taper
[23:02.620 --> 23:05.080]  that off in late flower.
[23:05.080 --> 23:08.920]  So like around week four or five, you can start pulling that back.
[23:08.920 --> 23:12.000]  And then he says shine starting in week three.
[23:12.520 --> 23:17.800]  So at the beginning of week three, add shine, put one gram, one to two grams per gallon
[23:17.800 --> 23:19.200]  of water is what he says.
[23:19.200 --> 23:24.480]  The shine starting in week three, one gram to two grams per gallon of water.
[23:24.480 --> 23:28.120]  And then you can kind of increase that a little bit as time goes on from what I've seen.
[23:28.120 --> 23:30.280]  So week three, do a gram to two.
[23:30.280 --> 23:31.680]  Week four, increase it a little bit.
[23:31.680 --> 23:33.340]  Week five, increase it a little bit.
[23:33.340 --> 23:36.640]  Six and seven, increase it a little bit and then start flushing from there.
[23:36.640 --> 23:40.240]  And then he says push foliar feed every five to six days.
[23:40.480 --> 23:45.520]  Honestly, I would cut out the push foliar feed, maybe spray it one time at the beginning
[23:45.520 --> 23:47.600]  of week five and then pull off of that.
[23:47.600 --> 23:53.360]  And he says to push foliar to spray 50 milliliters per gallon of water.
[23:53.360 --> 23:58.080]  So maybe if you've got a small crop, just mix up a half gallon and put 25 mils in there.
[23:58.080 --> 24:02.100]  I also think that pH-ing that water before you spray it may help you, but be careful
[24:02.100 --> 24:07.480]  what you use to pH because you don't want to go killing off the live.
[24:07.480 --> 24:10.920]  So there's silic acid, there's calcium and there's sea kelp in there.
[24:10.920 --> 24:13.880]  So be careful what you're using to adjust the pH.
[24:13.880 --> 24:17.520]  Also you asked if I add anything to that mix.
[24:17.520 --> 24:19.640]  Yes, I put a little bit of Osa-28 in there.
[24:19.640 --> 24:21.600]  I like to add some potassium silicates to the mix.
[24:21.600 --> 24:23.960]  I think that gives the plants more vigor.
[24:23.960 --> 24:26.360]  It makes them a little bit more robust.
[24:26.360 --> 24:32.000]  And then once about every once a week, once every 10 days-ish, I'll hit them with either
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.120]  hybrids or carbo load just to speed up some carbohydrates in there.
[24:36.120 --> 24:38.040]  Put a little bit of a boost in there.
[24:38.040 --> 24:40.560]  So that's what I add to the Veg Bloom mix.
[24:40.560 --> 24:44.120]  It's not too expensive that way and it is highly efficient.
[24:44.120 --> 24:45.520]  It'll put some shine on your plants.
[24:45.520 --> 24:46.520]  It'll make them beefy.
[24:46.520 --> 24:47.520]  They'll taste good.
[24:47.520 --> 24:48.520]  They'll be high in THC.
[24:48.520 --> 24:50.280]  You will have quality flowers.
[24:50.280 --> 24:52.120]  So that's what I add to the Veg Bloom.
[24:52.120 --> 24:55.480]  You also said you're already there in a basement.
[24:55.480 --> 24:56.480]  What else?
[24:56.480 --> 25:00.320]  What are some things you didn't expect going into such a large scale?
[25:00.320 --> 25:03.920]  the demand.
[25:03.920 --> 25:09.240]  I was expected to put out a specific amount of cannabis in a specific amount of time and
[25:09.240 --> 25:10.840]  I didn't know that there would be obstacles.
[25:10.840 --> 25:13.240]  I didn't expect that there would be a problem every day.
[25:13.240 --> 25:16.800]  When you walk into a large commercial grow, when I would train new people, we trained
[25:16.800 --> 25:20.720]  a few new guys and they said, so what's the first thing we do when we get in here?
[25:20.720 --> 25:21.720]  Everyone's excited.
[25:21.720 --> 25:24.320]  The first thing we got to do is find what fucked up last night.
[25:24.320 --> 25:25.320]  And they're always like, what?
[25:25.320 --> 25:28.560]  And I was like, there's so many moving parts.
[25:28.560 --> 25:30.440]  It's something in here just broke.
[25:30.440 --> 25:31.440]  And it's funny how-
[25:31.440 --> 25:36.480]  And that's the size and scope thing I was hitting at earlier.
[25:36.480 --> 25:41.320]  In any grow, you need to keep an eye on the moving parts, your timers, your plugs, your
[25:41.320 --> 25:44.360]  pumps, your hoses, connections, all of it.
[25:44.360 --> 25:49.000]  The bigger you grow, the more those equipment checks eat up into your time.
[25:49.000 --> 25:55.440]  When you're talking about a hundred light or a 500 light massive warehouse, checking
[25:55.440 --> 25:59.680]  to make sure none of your drip system plugs have come loose and are spraying water towards
[25:59.680 --> 26:01.040]  your ballast wall.
[26:01.040 --> 26:03.600]  That takes half the day sometimes.
[26:03.600 --> 26:07.960]  I spent honestly the first half of my shift when I would walk into the grow, the first
[26:07.960 --> 26:12.880]  hour would just be making sure that none of the cloners are clogged, none of the sprinkler
[26:12.880 --> 26:16.600]  system is clogged, none of the pumps are clogged, none of the breakers have flipped, all of
[26:16.600 --> 26:21.360]  the fans are on, all of the dehumidifiers are running and none of the filters were clogged
[26:21.360 --> 26:22.360]  up.
[26:22.360 --> 26:25.920]  You could seriously spend an hour checking all of that equipment just like that.
[26:25.920 --> 26:30.800]  I got a text message back from a buddy of mine maybe a month ago that read, can't talk,
[26:30.800 --> 26:32.320]  half the lights didn't come on this morning.
[26:32.320 --> 26:33.320]  Ouch.
[26:33.320 --> 26:37.320]  And it was just that two sentence way to let me know he can't talk right now and he's going
[26:37.320 --> 26:38.520]  to be busy all goddamn day.
[26:38.520 --> 26:40.240]  Until he figures this shit out.
[26:40.240 --> 26:43.680]  Yeah, I mean, that's a game changer.
[26:43.680 --> 26:46.300]  You've got a half million dollars and the fire's getting closer.
[26:46.300 --> 26:48.360]  It's really neat in our industry.
[26:48.360 --> 26:53.960]  We run multimillion dollar grow facilities that are responsible for, I'm not bragging,
[26:53.960 --> 26:57.920]  on Facebook, the owner of the facility I was growing for posted one time that I pulled
[26:57.920 --> 27:05.480]  320 something and a fraction pounds of cannabis from 85 lights, which is 3.
[27:05.480 --> 27:06.480]  Something pounds per light.
[27:06.480 --> 27:09.480]  I don't even remember where the hell I was headed with.
[27:09.480 --> 27:10.480]  What was I saying?
[27:10.480 --> 27:12.360]  Well, just the time and the scope.
[27:12.360 --> 27:16.560]  So there's that much product being grown, 300 and something pounds at somewhere between
[27:16.560 --> 27:20.120]  18 and $2,200 a pound, approximately $2,000 a pound.
[27:20.120 --> 27:23.000]  I had 300 of them times $2,000.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.920]  I produced that.
[27:24.920 --> 27:29.200]  And we rely on like 10 and $12 timers that could fuck everything.
[27:29.200 --> 27:33.160]  I find it really funny that we've got like this $8 timer from Lowe's that makes all of
[27:33.160 --> 27:34.160]  this get fed.
[27:34.160 --> 27:38.800]  If that one timer fucks up, the whole facility does not get water for a day.
[27:38.800 --> 27:41.560]  In a basement, your timer screws up.
[27:41.560 --> 27:45.360]  You don't notice it for three days.
[27:45.360 --> 27:52.640]  One growers out, you know, 6,000, 8,000, depending on how bad the problem got before
[27:52.640 --> 27:54.320]  it got found.
[27:54.320 --> 27:57.840]  Same thing happens in an industrial grow.
[27:57.840 --> 28:01.240]  Someone's out several million and everybody getting fired.
[28:01.240 --> 28:02.240]  Yeah.
[28:02.240 --> 28:04.480]  There's a whole dispensary that now has to go buy retail weed.
[28:04.480 --> 28:07.200]  Well no, and take this a step further.
[28:07.200 --> 28:10.600]  There's 365 days in a year and a shitload of them are fucking holidays.
[28:10.600 --> 28:13.720]  You want to be with your home, with your family.
[28:13.720 --> 28:19.880]  Everybody's got to be at the grow every day to make sure all your lights went off.
[28:19.880 --> 28:21.520]  When I started at Green and Healthy Wellness-
[28:21.520 --> 28:23.080]  Pumps are spraying everywhere.
[28:23.080 --> 28:24.080]  And I'm no longer there.
[28:24.080 --> 28:26.640]  I don't know if everybody listens to every episode, but I no longer work at Green and
[28:26.640 --> 28:27.640]  Healthy Wellness.
[28:27.640 --> 28:29.920]  I'm not involved in a large scale production facility at this time.
[28:29.920 --> 28:31.720]  I'm pursuing my own endeavors right now.
[28:31.720 --> 28:37.840]  But when I was at Green and Healthy Wellness for the first crop, I did not take a day off
[28:37.840 --> 28:42.480]  for the first harvest was we were in flower for nine or 10 weeks.
[28:42.480 --> 28:46.520]  There were some strains, the lemon G went for 11 weeks and then there was a little bit
[28:46.520 --> 28:48.120]  of veg time before that.
[28:48.120 --> 28:56.840]  I did not take a day off for 79 or 84-ish days because somebody had to be there.
[28:56.840 --> 29:00.320]  So that's something that I did not expect, but I was willing to do.
[29:00.320 --> 29:06.560]  You can't be even tangentially involved with the legal industry before the lazy stoner
[29:06.560 --> 29:07.560]  stereotype evaporates.
[29:08.560 --> 29:14.240]  I mean, the amount of work put in, the industrial grows, like the legal industry in Colorado,
[29:14.240 --> 29:16.120]  we did a billion in sales last year.
[29:16.120 --> 29:20.000]  We're going to do like 1.2 this year, maybe more.
[29:20.000 --> 29:27.640]  The amount of days, like 12, 15 hour days that people around the state put in to make
[29:27.640 --> 29:29.440]  that true is just astronomical.
[29:29.440 --> 29:32.560]  Can I spend a billion dollars in my lifetime?
[29:32.560 --> 29:34.640]  You think I buy a country and people are running.
[29:34.640 --> 29:37.040]  I could do it in like six hours on hash.
[29:38.040 --> 29:40.040]  You could do it in four minutes on drum gear.
[29:40.040 --> 29:41.040]  Can I come to that party?
[29:41.040 --> 29:42.040]  Yeah.
[29:42.040 --> 29:43.040]  Imagine the drum kit I'd build.
[29:43.040 --> 29:44.040]  Oh man, I can't decide which color.
[29:44.040 --> 29:45.040]  We'll just buy them all.
[29:45.040 --> 29:46.040]  Get one of every color.
[29:46.040 --> 29:47.040]  Okay.
[29:47.040 --> 29:48.040]  All right.
[29:48.040 --> 29:49.040]  We're all good.
[29:49.040 --> 29:57.240]  But just when you make that step from gray market or the basement up into the legal industry,
[29:57.240 --> 30:02.120]  everything changes in ways that you can't predict or imagine.
[30:02.120 --> 30:05.240]  I mean, you guys that are listening to this are lucky.
[30:05.240 --> 30:06.400]  You know this going in.
[30:06.560 --> 30:08.080]  We learned this shit the hard way.
[30:08.080 --> 30:10.520]  Something I got to jump in and talk about an ad.
[30:10.520 --> 30:13.640]  Something I did not expect that was overwhelming.
[30:13.640 --> 30:15.000]  Harvesting, drying and curing.
[30:15.000 --> 30:16.720]  I was not fucking prepared for that.
[30:16.720 --> 30:20.520]  You need space for however much bud you've got growing.
[30:20.520 --> 30:23.800]  You need that much room for hanging buds basically.
[30:23.800 --> 30:26.400]  Because you can't just crush it all together because it's going to get funky.
[30:26.400 --> 30:30.480]  You need a climate controlled room for drying and curing that much.
[30:30.480 --> 30:34.240]  That is something I totally did not plan properly for when I was at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[30:34.240 --> 30:41.320]  I've seen people try to put a football field size grow room into a bathroom size drying
[30:41.320 --> 30:43.400]  area and it's like, you're not going to do it.
[30:43.400 --> 30:44.400]  There's no way.
[30:44.400 --> 30:45.400]  Right.
[30:45.400 --> 30:46.400]  That air is going to get stuck in there.
[30:46.400 --> 30:47.400]  All the humidity is stuck in there.
[30:47.400 --> 30:48.400]  It's not going to go anywhere.
[30:48.400 --> 30:51.280]  You need somewhere for the freshly cut buds to be, for the older buds to be.
[30:51.280 --> 30:56.600]  You need a drying and curing, hanging, trimming system that is sufficient for your space.
[30:56.600 --> 30:58.160]  So make sure you work on that.
[30:58.160 --> 31:04.800]  The amount of, when you're doing any size grow, the best thing you can do to ensure
[31:04.800 --> 31:08.920]  success is to plan up front.
[31:08.920 --> 31:14.240]  When you're talking about the size and scope in the legal industry, that's astronomically
[31:14.240 --> 31:16.360]  important.
[31:16.360 --> 31:24.920]  I've seen little oversights lead to multimillion dollar fuck ups and businesses collapsing.
[31:24.920 --> 31:31.160]  I mean, just silly, stupid decisions or little things that people overlook.
[31:31.160 --> 31:32.160]  The cooling thing.
[31:32.160 --> 31:38.400]  I've seen multimillion dollar grows sit idle half the year because there isn't physically
[31:38.400 --> 31:43.920]  enough cooling on site to run during the hottest months of the year.
[31:43.920 --> 31:48.480]  And the business just needs to make another 300 grand before they can buy an air conditioner
[31:48.480 --> 31:50.360]  big enough to cool their whole space.
[31:50.360 --> 31:54.520]  Oh man, that's like having a dope, like a Ferrari or a rocket or a Tesla, but missing
[31:54.520 --> 31:55.520]  parts.
[31:55.520 --> 31:56.520]  You just got to keep working.
[31:56.520 --> 32:01.120]  I've seen other grows just say, fuck it and grow when it's way too hot and put out a super
[32:01.120 --> 32:02.120]  airy product.
[32:02.120 --> 32:03.760]  And then they just have it all blasted into hash.
[32:03.760 --> 32:05.480]  I'm so excited that the winter is coming.
[32:05.480 --> 32:06.920]  We get free air cooling.
[32:06.920 --> 32:08.840]  Just filter that air that comes in, you guys.
[32:08.840 --> 32:14.160]  You don't want to bring in ice crystals and fungus from outside, but filter that air.
[32:14.160 --> 32:18.760]  The temperature swing and the giant concrete wall that you didn't think about once while
[32:18.760 --> 32:24.080]  you were planning, causing massive powdery mildew and mold growth because of the temperature
[32:24.640 --> 32:25.640]  swing.
[32:25.640 --> 32:28.400]  I mean, how many people didn't see that coming in their original plans?
[32:28.400 --> 32:32.120]  And how do you heat a foot and a half thick concrete wall?
[32:32.120 --> 32:35.520]  I moved into one house that had a basement with one concrete exterior wall.
[32:35.520 --> 32:38.920]  And the first time that I grew in that basement in the winter, guess what?
[32:38.920 --> 32:41.040]  White rhino plant, like a five ounce plant.
[32:41.040 --> 32:42.640]  It looks like a frosted Christmas tree.
[32:42.640 --> 32:44.440]  It got all funked up with powdery mildew.
[32:44.440 --> 32:45.440]  It went buh-bye.
[32:45.440 --> 32:50.640]  I watched another guy, what he thought were the best plants in the harvest.
[32:50.800 --> 32:56.280]  When we finally got back to them, the section of wall that they were up against was ice
[32:56.280 --> 32:57.280]  cold.
[32:57.280 --> 32:58.280]  Oh yeah.
[32:58.280 --> 33:02.680]  And they were, I mean, it was the craziest looking pink mold I've ever seen.
[33:02.680 --> 33:03.920]  But I mean, just foulness.
[33:03.920 --> 33:05.800]  And it was because of the temperature swing.
[33:05.800 --> 33:11.360]  When you multiply that, I mean, that was like maybe a $400 loss to that grower.
[33:11.360 --> 33:13.680]  But if that was in an industrial setting, it'd be 400,000.
[33:13.680 --> 33:15.920]  Yeah, it would have just kept going right down that row.
[33:15.920 --> 33:16.920]  All right.
[33:16.920 --> 33:19.640]  So those are a lot of things that you can look out for and you can expect.
[33:19.640 --> 33:25.760]  He also said, any other advice you may think one would need knowing about taking a leap
[33:25.760 --> 33:27.800]  into the big leagues?
[33:27.800 --> 33:29.240]  Keep a positive attitude.
[33:29.240 --> 33:30.240]  Shit's going to happen.
[33:30.240 --> 33:32.560]  Like I said, every day you're going to walk into that grow and you're going to find some
[33:32.560 --> 33:35.680]  bullshit and you can either freak out, you can throw your arms up in the air and you
[33:35.680 --> 33:37.480]  can be like, ah, what the fuck happened in here?
[33:37.480 --> 33:39.920]  And you can kick some buckets and you can throw some shit around and make more of a
[33:39.920 --> 33:42.000]  mess or you can go get the fucking mop.
[33:42.000 --> 33:47.640]  You can mop it up, figure out where that pump broke, go get some PVC pipe and a saw and fix
[33:47.640 --> 33:50.680]  all that shit that you got to fix and just put some glue on it and hope it doesn't break
[33:50.680 --> 33:53.480]  again because you still got work to do.
[33:53.480 --> 33:54.720]  Plants need to be grown.
[33:54.720 --> 33:55.760]  Shit's going to keep going.
[33:55.760 --> 33:56.760]  So that's what I can say.
[33:56.760 --> 33:57.760]  Keep a positive attitude.
[33:57.760 --> 33:58.760]  Keep your head up.
[33:58.760 --> 33:59.760]  Also, uh, pay attention.
[33:59.760 --> 34:03.600]  Um, make sure you're getting paid what you deserve to be paid.
[34:03.600 --> 34:07.760]  And if there's some shit in the grow that can be done today, do it.
[34:07.760 --> 34:08.940]  Don't wait until tomorrow.
[34:08.940 --> 34:10.160]  Just fucking do it.
[34:10.160 --> 34:11.160]  Never in the grow.
[34:11.160 --> 34:14.520]  I mean, little things that you can get away with at home.
[34:14.520 --> 34:18.080]  I mean, sometimes for weeks at a time, you can get away with at home.
[34:18.080 --> 34:20.480]  Do not fly in an industrial setting.
[34:20.480 --> 34:25.520]  There's just so much less room for error and things are going to stack up.
[34:25.520 --> 34:28.240]  You're going to think I've got eight hours worth of work to do today.
[34:28.240 --> 34:29.240]  I'll knock that out.
[34:29.240 --> 34:30.560]  I'll do eight hours worth of work tomorrow.
[34:30.560 --> 34:34.280]  While you're doing eight hours worth of work today, something's going to fuck up.
[34:34.280 --> 34:36.760]  No one's prepared for the level of work at harvest.
[34:36.760 --> 34:38.960]  You're going to have to, you're going to have to go and clean up something.
[34:38.960 --> 34:40.960]  And now you've got nine hours worth of work to do today.
[34:40.960 --> 34:43.000]  So you're going to say, I'm not going to get this last part done.
[34:43.000 --> 34:44.000]  I'll do it tomorrow.
[34:44.480 --> 34:46.360]  You've got nine hours worth of work to do.
[34:46.360 --> 34:47.960]  Something else is going to go wrong.
[34:47.960 --> 34:49.000]  Somebody's going to interrupt you.
[34:49.000 --> 34:50.760]  Somebody's going to call a piece of equipment's going to break.
[34:50.760 --> 34:52.600]  You're going to have to take a poop.
[34:52.600 --> 34:53.600]  Someone's going to take a little extra time.
[34:53.600 --> 34:55.560]  You're going to have to go to the store and pick up a part.
[34:55.560 --> 34:59.340]  Now your nine hour day just turned into a 10 hour day and you don't even get a lunch
[34:59.340 --> 35:01.160]  break and now you're hungry and grouchy.
[35:01.160 --> 35:03.320]  And so when you go home and try to take care of your plants, they're going to look like
[35:03.320 --> 35:04.960]  shit and it's just going to keep catching up with you.
[35:04.960 --> 35:07.880]  So if there's some shit you can do today, do it today.
[35:07.880 --> 35:12.040]  Sweep that shit up, spray whatever you got to spray, clean up that dirt, be looking out
[35:12.080 --> 35:15.280]  for pests, look out for mildew every day and just be prepared.
[35:15.560 --> 35:17.440]  Get you some method seven so you don't go blind.
[35:17.560 --> 35:19.240]  That's probably one of the best things I could say.
[35:19.800 --> 35:21.120]  Good sunglasses and sleep.
[35:21.400 --> 35:22.760]  Yeah. Some some method sevens.
[35:22.760 --> 35:25.960]  Keep your skin covered. I think that covers a whole bunch, man.
[35:26.000 --> 35:27.520]  This guy asked a whole bunch of great stuff.
[35:27.520 --> 35:32.280]  He basically gave you like the five thousand dollar consult fee in an episode and a
[35:32.280 --> 35:33.280]  half. There you go.
[35:33.560 --> 35:35.280]  You can send donations to my email.
[35:35.280 --> 35:36.880]  No, I'm just kidding, man.
[35:36.880 --> 35:38.840]  I think that's all that we've got for you said.
[35:38.840 --> 35:40.240]  I hope you can answer some questions.
[35:40.240 --> 35:42.120]  Well, I think we handled that for you.
[35:42.280 --> 35:45.640]  Yeah. If if you want more information on any part of that, there was a lot of
[35:45.640 --> 35:48.640]  information and I know this applies to a lot more than just the guy asking the
[35:48.640 --> 35:53.080]  question. So feel free to shoot us for the questions that the email Jeff keeps
[35:53.080 --> 35:54.200]  giving you. Yeah, everybody.
[35:54.200 --> 35:55.680]  I want to hear. I love generating.
[35:55.840 --> 35:58.040]  I love creating listener generated content.
[35:58.040 --> 35:59.480]  That's how I know I'm giving you what you want.
[35:59.480 --> 36:02.000]  It's like you went to the restaurant and you ordered exactly what you wanted and I
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.720]  was able to whip that up like the chef and bring it out to you and serve it hot.
[36:05.040 --> 36:06.080]  It's super fresh for you.
[36:06.080 --> 36:07.280]  So send me email.
[36:07.320 --> 36:08.920]  Grow from your heart at Hotmail dot com.
[36:08.920 --> 36:10.200]  It's really easy to get in touch with me.
[36:10.280 --> 36:11.800]  I check that email very frequently.
[36:11.800 --> 36:14.400]  It goes to my phone. It jingles in my pocket when you send me an email.
[36:14.400 --> 36:16.560]  I like it. So send me a message.
[36:16.640 --> 36:17.880]  I would love to hear from you there.
[36:18.200 --> 36:21.480]  Mike, tell everyone how they can find you on social media so that they can go
[36:21.480 --> 36:26.600]  stalk you. You can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws or on
[36:26.600 --> 36:28.680]  Twitter at at Nimo Punk 15.
[36:28.760 --> 36:29.920]  Nimo Punk 15.
[36:29.920 --> 36:30.880]  How'd you come up with that, bro?
[36:30.880 --> 36:33.240]  I've always been no one.
[36:33.800 --> 36:35.120]  I've literally had it since 15.
[36:35.120 --> 36:36.760]  That's the 15. Since I was 15.
[36:36.760 --> 36:37.880]  That's what 15 come from.
[36:37.880 --> 36:40.640]  Comes from Nimo is just no one.
[36:40.760 --> 36:44.880]  And I like that when I was 15 and then punk because I was 15 and I thought it was
[36:44.880 --> 36:46.680]  cute because you were a little punk.
[36:46.680 --> 36:50.920]  Like you're 15. Six years later, finding Nimo comes out and I was like, man, I
[36:50.920 --> 36:52.080]  just never got around to changing it.
[36:52.080 --> 36:55.520]  That I when I went to create a Twitter handle, it was like, do you want to use the
[36:55.520 --> 36:57.280]  Hotmail account? You've had since you were 15.
[36:57.640 --> 36:58.520]  I clicked. Sure.
[36:58.760 --> 37:04.560]  Why not? And now we're at one hundred and fifty nine episodes in and I'm stuck
[37:04.560 --> 37:05.840]  with it. It works.
[37:06.000 --> 37:06.920]  Nimo Punk 15.
[37:06.920 --> 37:10.400]  Follow me, guys. I am at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[37:10.400 --> 37:12.520]  You can also find me at Rasta Jeff for 20.
[37:12.760 --> 37:16.120]  You guys, I just hit eight thousand followers on Instagram.
[37:16.120 --> 37:18.000]  It'd be really cool if you follow me on Instagram.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.720]  I'm Iree underscore genetics 20 before.
[37:20.800 --> 37:21.680]  Right. Right.
[37:22.120 --> 37:24.520]  I had an account. I was about twenty thousand and they deleted me.
[37:24.520 --> 37:27.280]  They took me down. But you know what? I like it because now none of my not I can't
[37:27.280 --> 37:30.760]  say none, but my followers are not bots and I'm not following a bunch of bullshit
[37:30.760 --> 37:32.720]  accounts. I kind of got a refresh or restart.
[37:32.720 --> 37:34.080]  It's cleaner. I get more.
[37:34.240 --> 37:36.120]  I get more likes now than I did before.
[37:36.120 --> 37:38.720]  Found a silver lining to that nasty little cloud.
[37:38.720 --> 37:40.080]  Yeah. So follow me on Instagram.
[37:40.080 --> 37:41.800]  You guys, Iree underscore genetics.
[37:41.800 --> 37:44.000]  I are I underscore genetics.

[38:03.760 --> 38:05.600]  the show. You guys, I'd love it if you send me emails.
