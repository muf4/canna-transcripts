[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  My favorite part of the night right now is that you're dancing to music that is not playing.
[00:05.000 --> 00:06.500]  Dude, I'm always doing that.
[00:06.500 --> 00:08.000]  What song are you dancing to, bro?
[00:08.000 --> 00:11.000]  I honestly, I just got to beat my heart, brother.
[00:11.000 --> 00:12.500]  You're just moving over there, buddy.
[00:12.500 --> 00:16.500]  You know, you just try to be excited for the things you like doing, man.
[00:16.500 --> 00:18.500]  Here we are. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:18.500 --> 00:22.500]  It is time for episode 492 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:22.500 --> 00:25.500]  Sitting across the table from me once again is Tall Clint.
[00:25.500 --> 00:26.500]  Welcome to the show, buddy.
[00:26.500 --> 00:28.000]  Hey, friends. How are you guys doing?
[00:28.000 --> 00:29.500]  Hope everybody's having a great day.
[00:29.500 --> 00:32.500]  Big old cough right into the microphone there.
[00:32.500 --> 00:33.500]  Professional way to start a show.
[00:33.500 --> 00:34.500]  Good morning.
[00:34.500 --> 00:36.500]  If you guys cannot tell, we are smoking.
[00:36.500 --> 00:37.500]  I am taking some dabs.
[00:37.500 --> 00:39.500]  Clint still hasn't dabbed.
[00:39.500 --> 00:41.500]  Yeah, dude. I'm pretty cool.
[00:41.500 --> 00:42.500]  I'm pretty cool.
[00:42.500 --> 00:44.500]  You get stoned off the flowers you do smoke, so that's cool.
[00:44.500 --> 00:45.500]  I'm kind of jealous.
[00:45.500 --> 00:47.500]  Yeah, I don't.
[00:47.500 --> 00:51.500]  I like, I'm jealous of you getting to like taste everything.
[00:51.500 --> 00:54.000]  That seems like a fun like connoisseur thing to do.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  Like because I don't drink, I don't have like that micro brew.
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  Oh, let's introduce the show.
[00:59.000 --> 01:00.000]  No, we can talk.
[01:00.000 --> 01:01.500]  They know what they're listening to.
[01:01.500 --> 01:02.500]  It's the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:02.500 --> 01:03.500]  Episode 492.
[01:03.500 --> 01:04.500]  Clint's here.
[01:04.500 --> 01:05.500]  We're getting stoned, obviously.
[01:05.500 --> 01:06.500]  I'm dabbing.
[01:06.500 --> 01:07.500]  Clint's smoking flower.
[01:07.500 --> 01:08.500]  Clint is smoking.
[01:08.500 --> 01:10.000]  Did you say that's AK-47?
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  That's correct.
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.000]  That smells wonderful.
[01:12.000 --> 01:13.500]  I actually smoked some of that flower.
[01:13.500 --> 01:14.500]  It tastes delicious.
[01:14.500 --> 01:16.000]  It was well grown.
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.000]  It was well cured.
[01:17.000 --> 01:18.500]  Could have been trimmed a little tiny bit better.
[01:18.500 --> 01:19.500]  That's on me.
[01:19.500 --> 01:20.500]  Dude, while I'm thinking about it,
[01:20.500 --> 01:23.500]  shout out to Dirtman Dan for the incredible gift.
[01:23.500 --> 01:26.500]  He gave me these little, I don't know what they're called,
[01:26.500 --> 01:28.000]  but they're basically little thumb scissors.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.500]  It's just a little condom that goes on your thumb,
[01:30.500 --> 01:32.500]  and it's got a little like a thumbnail,
[01:32.500 --> 01:34.000]  like a metal thumbnail on it.
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.000]  And it's for trimming weed.
[01:35.000 --> 01:36.500]  Or you could probably trim a lot of other things,
[01:36.500 --> 01:38.500]  but it makes, if you're a hand trimmer,
[01:38.500 --> 01:40.500]  and you just trim, if you dry trim weed
[01:40.500 --> 01:41.500]  that's already kind of dry,
[01:41.500 --> 01:43.000]  I've got a beautiful method for using these things.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.500]  I know exactly how I'll use them.
[01:44.500 --> 01:45.500]  Thank you, Dan.
[01:45.500 --> 01:47.000]  It's going to be, it's a great product.
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.500]  I don't know the company that makes them or anything.
[01:48.500 --> 01:49.500]  They're over there in a package.
[01:49.500 --> 01:51.500]  He sent them to me as a Christmas present.
[01:51.500 --> 01:52.500]  Oh, that's so nice.
[01:52.500 --> 01:53.500]  Yeah, that was really cool of you.
[01:53.500 --> 01:54.500]  I know exactly what they are.
[01:54.500 --> 01:55.500]  I know exactly how they'll be used.
[01:55.500 --> 01:56.500]  Fucking cool.
[01:56.500 --> 01:57.000]  Thank you, Dan.
[01:57.000 --> 01:58.000]  I appreciate that.
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  The ADD is kicking in.
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.500]  Clint is good and stoned.
[02:01.500 --> 02:03.000]  That weed could have been trimmed a little bit better.
[02:03.000 --> 02:04.000]  That's on me.
[02:04.000 --> 02:05.000]  I'm well-baked.
[02:05.000 --> 02:06.000]  I smoked some of that weed.
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.000]  I took some dabs.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.500]  Do you want to describe the flavors and aromas of your flower,
[02:10.500 --> 02:11.500]  or are you even into that?
[02:11.500 --> 02:13.500]  I have such a hard time.
[02:13.500 --> 02:14.500]  I know.
[02:14.500 --> 02:15.500]  As soon as I started asking,
[02:15.500 --> 02:18.000]  I was like, Clint's not really a descriptive kind of guy like that.
[02:18.000 --> 02:19.000]  No, I don't.
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  It tastes like an overall taste.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.500]  Would you say bubble gummy and slightly fruity?
[02:23.500 --> 02:24.500]  No, I would.
[02:24.500 --> 02:28.500]  I need to try it again real quick, and I'll let you know.
[02:28.500 --> 02:29.500]  Give me one moment, Jeff.
[02:29.500 --> 02:32.500]  As soon as you opened the jar of it when you got here,
[02:32.500 --> 02:34.500]  it smelled bubble gummy and kind of fruity,
[02:34.500 --> 02:36.500]  and I was like, that smells pretty damn good.
[02:36.500 --> 02:39.500]  Then when I hit it, that bubble gum and fruit flavor came through.
[02:39.500 --> 02:41.500]  That means it was dried and cured properly.
[02:41.500 --> 02:42.500]  I like it, bro.
[02:42.500 --> 02:43.500]  So good flower.
[02:43.500 --> 02:45.500]  Whoever grew that, big shout out to the chef.
[02:45.500 --> 02:49.500]  Yeah, I did the drying and curing on that one.
[02:49.500 --> 02:51.500]  It was a broken branch off of a friend's plant.
[02:51.500 --> 02:52.500]  Cool.
[02:52.500 --> 02:54.500]  Well, that friend, until they broke the branch,
[02:54.500 --> 02:55.500]  they did a pretty good job.
[02:55.500 --> 02:56.500]  Well, you know,
[02:56.500 --> 02:59.500]  it happens when you get some heavy buds going up there
[02:59.500 --> 03:01.500]  and you don't have the trellising set up well.
[03:01.500 --> 03:02.500]  There you go.
[03:02.500 --> 03:04.500]  Sometimes branches break, you guys.
[03:04.500 --> 03:05.500]  I'm just talking shit.
[03:05.500 --> 03:06.500]  Just picking up.
[03:06.500 --> 03:07.500]  Good weed.
[03:07.500 --> 03:08.500]  Good job, dude.
[03:08.500 --> 03:12.500]  I'm smoking on the Sour Best Lemons full spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs.
[03:12.500 --> 03:16.500]  This is a blend of S-B-S-E.
[03:16.500 --> 03:18.500]  I don't know what S-B-S-E stands for.
[03:18.500 --> 03:20.500]  I should have done some research there.
[03:20.500 --> 03:23.500]  It's S-B-S-E and Lemon Tree Northern Lights.
[03:23.500 --> 03:29.500]  On the package, the flavor is described as lemons, lemons, and more lemons,
[03:29.500 --> 03:30.500]  is what the package says.
[03:30.500 --> 03:32.500]  That's what it's been described as.
[03:32.500 --> 03:33.500]  It should be lemony.
[03:33.500 --> 03:37.500]  It is absolutely fucking lemony, dude.
[03:37.500 --> 03:38.500]  Yeah?
[03:38.500 --> 03:39.500]  I was tipping the package over.
[03:39.500 --> 03:41.500]  I like to take photos of my concentrates,
[03:41.500 --> 03:43.500]  and then I share them to my social media feed.
[03:43.500 --> 03:45.500]  I only put them on my story.
[03:45.500 --> 03:47.500]  I don't put them in my Instagram post
[03:47.500 --> 03:50.500]  because Instagram can be haters when I post photos of concentrates,
[03:50.500 --> 03:51.500]  and they'll take the picture down.
[03:51.500 --> 03:52.500]  Really?
[03:52.500 --> 03:55.500]  I put it up in the story, and it stays for 24 hours, and it disappears.
[03:55.500 --> 03:58.500]  Then my good friends at Green Dot Labs, they repost it,
[03:58.500 --> 04:00.500]  so it gets to be seen by a few more folks.
[04:00.500 --> 04:01.500]  I do post the photos.
[04:01.500 --> 04:05.500]  As I was taking a photo of this, I noticed there are so many turps in this jar.
[04:05.500 --> 04:07.500]  This is a four-gram jar.
[04:07.500 --> 04:09.500]  I think it's two and a half grams of turps,
[04:09.500 --> 04:13.500]  minus the quarter gram of turps that poured out onto my finger.
[04:13.500 --> 04:15.500]  I didn't realize it was coming out.
[04:15.500 --> 04:17.500]  Just a little bit of turp sauce on my finger.
[04:17.500 --> 04:20.500]  It looked like a little maple syrup, a little pancake syrup.
[04:20.500 --> 04:23.500]  Not the color, but the consistency of maybe some honey or some maple syrup on my finger.
[04:23.500 --> 04:24.500]  Pretty thick.
[04:24.500 --> 04:25.500]  I didn't know what to do with it.
[04:25.500 --> 04:26.500]  I think I panicked.
[04:26.500 --> 04:28.500]  I was going to take a picture of it because it was really pretty.
[04:28.500 --> 04:31.500]  I was like, oh, that's really pretty, just turp dripping off my finger.
[04:31.500 --> 04:35.500]  It was going to drip onto the table and or the floor, and I didn't want that to happen,
[04:35.500 --> 04:37.500]  so I licked it off my finger.
[04:37.500 --> 04:41.500]  I'm not sure if that was a good or a bad idea.
[04:41.500 --> 04:44.500]  You did say that was the first time you've ever done that.
[04:44.500 --> 04:47.500]  I think that's, to the best of my memory, that's the first time.
[04:47.500 --> 04:51.500]  I may have had some Lemon Jeffrey turps in a smaller dose in that manner,
[04:51.500 --> 04:57.500]  but that was a nice little blah, blah, blah, and my tongue had a weird sensation for a few minutes.
[04:57.500 --> 05:00.500]  It felt like my tongue was kind of tingly and kind of vibratey.
[05:00.500 --> 05:05.500]  Then it tasted like lemons and lemons and more lemons.
[05:05.500 --> 05:08.500]  Also tasted like the forest.
[05:08.500 --> 05:10.500]  It was very pine tree in my mouth.
[05:11.500 --> 05:14.500]  It was like if you took me to the National Forest 40 minutes south of here.
[05:14.500 --> 05:18.500]  If you took me there and you're like, breathe in, that's what my mouth tasted like, just foresty.
[05:18.500 --> 05:21.500]  It was delicious, but that was a very unique thing.
[05:21.500 --> 05:27.500]  I'm not sure because I did take two fat dabs of the Sour Best lemons and a couple of puffs off that bowl.
[05:27.500 --> 05:31.500]  I'm high, and I don't know if I got extra high from the part that I put on my tongue or not,
[05:31.500 --> 05:34.500]  but I am certainly high as shit right now.
[05:34.500 --> 05:37.500]  I wonder if you're ingesting it in a different way too.
[05:37.500 --> 05:39.500]  Yeah, we're just getting it sublingually maybe.
[05:39.500 --> 05:42.500]  When it goes straight into your tongue like that, it was mostly turps.
[05:42.500 --> 05:44.500]  It was turpid delicate on my face.
[05:44.500 --> 05:45.500]  It lasted for a long time.
[05:45.500 --> 05:46.500]  It was almost spicy.
[05:46.500 --> 05:51.500]  It was so turpy that it was like spicy lemons, and I don't know if that makes any sense.
[05:51.500 --> 05:55.500]  The Sour Best lemons full spectrum extract has me rambling like a fucking fool so far.
[05:55.500 --> 05:57.500]  Delicious concentrate.
[05:57.500 --> 06:03.500]  On the back, it says 71.93% THC and non-detectable CBD.
[06:03.500 --> 06:04.500]  I really approve.
[06:04.500 --> 06:07.500]  Good job to our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[06:08.500 --> 06:09.500]  What do we do next?
[06:09.500 --> 06:10.500]  We never did the Seeds Here Now ad.
[06:10.500 --> 06:12.500]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[06:12.500 --> 06:13.500]  That's what I usually do.
[06:13.500 --> 06:16.500]  I like to send people to Seeds Here Now to go get their seeds.
[06:16.500 --> 06:20.500]  You need new seeds in your garden, regular feminized auto flowers, all of the above.
[06:20.500 --> 06:22.500]  You can get them at Seeds Here Now.
[06:22.500 --> 06:23.500]  How do you find them, Clint?
[06:23.500 --> 06:27.500]  SeedsHereNow.com.
[06:27.500 --> 06:28.500]  There you go.
[06:28.500 --> 06:29.500]  You look lost in stone.
[06:29.500 --> 06:30.500]  I like it.
[06:30.500 --> 06:31.500]  Yeah, it's working.
[06:31.500 --> 06:32.500]  You're here.
[06:32.500 --> 06:33.500]  All right.
[06:33.500 --> 06:35.500]  We're going to talk about some fun shit on the show.
[06:35.500 --> 06:37.500]  Do we do this part or do we do this part?
[06:37.500 --> 06:38.500]  Let's just do the Patreon part next.
[06:38.500 --> 06:40.500]  We'll keep going down how we normally do it.
[06:40.500 --> 06:42.500]  Let's give some shout outs to our friends on Patreon.
[06:42.500 --> 06:45.500]  We have a lot of kind folks who support the show through Patreon.
[06:45.500 --> 06:49.500]  Let's start off with a shout out to, how about a shout out to Karen Crawford?
[06:49.500 --> 06:51.500]  How about a big Grow From Your Heart podcast?
[06:51.500 --> 06:52.500]  Shout out to Ryan S.
[06:52.500 --> 06:54.500]  I want to send a big thank you to Tanner M.
[06:54.500 --> 06:56.500]  We got to give a big thank you to Sour D.
[06:56.500 --> 06:59.500]  Of course, a shout out to our friend Eric R.
[06:59.500 --> 07:01.500]  We got to give a giant shout out to our buddy Reefer Matness.
[07:01.500 --> 07:03.500]  A shout out to Greg S.
[07:03.500 --> 07:05.500]  I want to send a shout out to Sam.
[07:05.500 --> 07:06.500]  How about a big Grow From Your Heart podcast?
[07:06.500 --> 07:08.500]  High five to my buddy Aldridge.
[07:08.500 --> 07:13.500]  And last but not least, I want to send a shout out to Big Toe Grows.
[07:13.500 --> 07:16.500]  Big thanks to all those folks because they support the show on Patreon.
[07:16.500 --> 07:17.500]  That really helps us out.
[07:17.500 --> 07:20.500]  If anybody else out there would like to learn how to support the show on Patreon,
[07:20.500 --> 07:27.500]  you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[07:27.500 --> 07:31.500]  All of the information you need is right biggity there on the
[07:31.500 --> 07:33.500]  scriddly, scrizzly screen.
[07:33.500 --> 07:34.500]  Thank you, patrons.
[07:34.500 --> 07:36.500]  Yes, thank you guys for helping us out.
[07:36.500 --> 07:39.500]  Dude, I'm pretty sure I got lit off of the concentrate that I ate.
[07:39.500 --> 07:42.500]  Things are just going more slowly and slowly as time goes on.
[07:42.500 --> 07:43.500]  This is fun, man.
[07:43.500 --> 07:44.500]  I don't mind.
[07:44.500 --> 07:45.500]  It's a good feeling.
[07:45.500 --> 07:50.500]  Seeing you in a different mode is, or maybe not mode.
[07:50.500 --> 07:52.500]  I'm usually not this stoned, that is for sure.
[07:52.500 --> 07:53.500]  That's right.
[07:53.500 --> 07:54.500]  And I may have needed it.
[07:54.500 --> 07:55.500]  That's a good segue.
[07:55.500 --> 07:56.500]  That's a good segue.
[07:56.500 --> 07:57.500]  I said I may have needed it.
[07:57.500 --> 08:01.500]  You guys, I want to send a thank you to everybody who has sent me some love and
[08:01.500 --> 08:03.500]  some support and some words of encouragement.
[08:03.500 --> 08:06.500]  On the last episode, I did have to break bad news.
[08:06.500 --> 08:09.500]  I had a very close family member pass away on Christmas Eve.
[08:09.500 --> 08:11.500]  That was surprising.
[08:11.500 --> 08:12.500]  It was sudden.
[08:12.500 --> 08:14.500]  He wasn't very sick for very long.
[08:14.500 --> 08:18.500]  He got sick like fucking Wednesday and died like fucking Thursday or something.
[08:18.500 --> 08:19.500]  Damn.
[08:19.500 --> 08:20.500]  Yeah, it was quick.
[08:20.500 --> 08:24.500]  With the support of my friends like Clint and the rest of my good family and Mike,
[08:25.500 --> 08:28.500]  I can't list everybody because I'll forget somebody, but you guys know who you are.
[08:28.500 --> 08:31.500]  Everybody who reached out to me and sent me some love, thank you.
[08:31.500 --> 08:36.500]  That sort of stuff, that means a lot to somebody who puts their, my whole life is out on the
[08:36.500 --> 08:37.500]  internet.
[08:37.500 --> 08:39.500]  So when people return all that love, that means a lot to me.
[08:39.500 --> 08:40.500]  Thank you guys for getting me through that.
[08:40.500 --> 08:42.500]  It was my uncle Eric who passed away.
[08:42.500 --> 08:44.500]  He was a bad motherfucker.
[08:44.500 --> 08:45.500]  He was a cool dude.
[08:45.500 --> 08:46.500]  That's rad.
[08:46.500 --> 08:47.500]  He was a cool guy.
[08:47.500 --> 08:48.500]  Yeah.
[08:48.500 --> 08:50.500]  I get a lot of my smart ass personality from him.
[08:50.500 --> 08:55.500]  My, uh, my business savvy, my comedic sense of timing kind of came from him.
[08:55.500 --> 08:59.500]  Uh, so I'm going to miss him a lot, but I'm doing a lot better since I got all these friends
[08:59.500 --> 09:00.500]  around, all the support.
[09:00.500 --> 09:04.500]  And since I just ate a fucking big mouthful of fucking concentrates, I'm in a much better
[09:04.500 --> 09:05.500]  mood.
[09:05.500 --> 09:06.500]  So thank you guys.
[09:06.500 --> 09:07.500]  I want to say thanks to everybody.
[09:07.500 --> 09:11.500]  I got a lot of emails, a lot of, a lot of YouTube comments, many, many YouTube.
[09:11.500 --> 09:12.500]  Hey, thanks you too.
[09:12.500 --> 09:13.500]  Yeah.
[09:13.500 --> 09:17.500]  A lot of Instagram messages, a lot of Facebook support, a lot of text messages, a lot of
[09:17.500 --> 09:18.500]  phone calls.
[09:18.500 --> 09:19.500]  So thank you guys.
[09:19.500 --> 09:20.500]  Uh, the family is going to be okay.
[09:20.500 --> 09:21.500]  I think we'll all be all right.
[09:21.500 --> 09:22.500]  Uh, just man, take a minute to hug the people that you love.
[09:22.500 --> 09:23.500]  I know I said that on the last episode, but this dude got sick.
[09:23.500 --> 09:24.500]  Like, like I said, it took just a couple of days.
[09:24.500 --> 09:25.500]  It was like, I don't feel good.
[09:25.500 --> 09:26.500]  I'm dead.
[09:26.500 --> 09:27.500]  It was just fucking quick.
[09:27.500 --> 09:28.500]  Yeah.
[09:28.500 --> 09:29.500]  So maybe that's better for him.
[09:29.500 --> 09:30.500]  You know, I guess I don't want to get sick and suffer.
[09:30.500 --> 09:31.500]  I want to go fuck.
[09:31.500 --> 09:32.500]  I've got what?
[09:32.500 --> 09:33.500]  Oh, I'm dead.
[09:33.500 --> 09:34.500]  That's a tile.
[09:34.500 --> 09:35.500]  What?
[09:35.500 --> 09:36.500]  A nuclear bomb.
[09:36.500 --> 09:37.500]  And then it's over.
[09:37.500 --> 09:38.500]  Yeah.
[09:38.500 --> 09:39.500]  I've always said I wanted my last words to be.
[09:39.500 --> 09:40.500]  We that's it.
[09:41.500 --> 09:42.500]  I'm going to something fun.
[09:42.500 --> 09:43.500]  I don't know.
[09:43.500 --> 09:44.500]  It sounds, it sounds exciting when you do it like that.
[09:44.500 --> 09:45.500]  Yeah.
[09:45.500 --> 09:46.500]  I have a fun death.
[09:46.500 --> 09:47.500]  Yeah.
[09:47.500 --> 09:48.500]  Instead of just dragging it out and fucking waiting for the day.
[09:48.500 --> 09:49.500]  Yeah.
[09:49.500 --> 09:50.500]  Anyway, what's getting weird and morbid now, but a big shout out to my uncle Eric.
[09:50.500 --> 09:51.500]  Great fucking dude.
[09:51.500 --> 09:52.500]  Big shout out to the rest of my family.
[09:52.500 --> 09:53.500]  Big thanks.
[09:53.500 --> 09:54.500]  Uncle Eric.
[09:54.500 --> 09:55.500]  Yeah, dude.
[09:55.500 --> 09:56.500]  Uh, I'll see you there one day, bro.
[09:56.500 --> 09:57.500]  Save me some room.
[09:57.500 --> 09:58.500]  Uh, but I'm going to go.
[09:58.500 --> 09:59.500]  I'm going to go.
[09:59.500 --> 10:00.500]  I'm going to go.
[10:00.500 --> 10:01.500]  I'm going to go.
[10:01.500 --> 10:02.500]  I'm going to go.
[10:02.500 --> 10:03.500]  I'm going to go.
[10:03.500 --> 10:04.500]  I'm going to go.
[10:04.500 --> 10:05.500]  I'm going to go.
[10:05.500 --> 10:06.500]  I'm going to go.
[10:07.500 --> 10:08.500]  I'll see you there one day, bro.
[10:08.500 --> 10:09.500]  Save me some room.
[10:09.500 --> 10:11.500]  Uh, but thanks to everybody who sent me some support.
[10:11.500 --> 10:13.500]  Uh, that means a lot to me.
[10:13.500 --> 10:14.500]  We're here doing a Monday show.
[10:14.500 --> 10:16.500]  You guys got me in the good spirits and got me ready.
[10:16.500 --> 10:18.500]  I couldn't be down for too long.
[10:18.500 --> 10:22.500]  I could, I could sit there and fucking cry and be depressed and hate life for all this,
[10:22.500 --> 10:23.500]  but nah, what's that going to do?
[10:23.500 --> 10:24.500]  We got to fucking smile.
[10:24.500 --> 10:27.500]  And my uncle Eric would say, bro, do your show pussy.
[10:27.500 --> 10:29.500]  Like tell me to do.
[10:29.500 --> 10:30.500]  Yeah.
[10:30.500 --> 10:31.500]  My uncle Eric was pretty cool.
[10:31.500 --> 10:32.500]  He'd be like, I'm dead.
[10:32.500 --> 10:33.500]  What are you going to do?
[10:33.500 --> 10:34.500]  Yeah.
[10:34.500 --> 10:35.500]  I miss him.
[10:35.500 --> 10:36.500]  Dude, I cried plenty.
[10:36.500 --> 10:37.500]  I feel you on that.
[10:37.500 --> 10:38.500]  Yeah.
[10:38.500 --> 10:39.500]  I cried plenty.
[10:39.500 --> 10:41.500]  And, but now that's, it's time to do a podcast now.
[10:41.500 --> 10:43.500]  Not that I still don't miss the dude, but what are we going to do, man?
[10:43.500 --> 10:45.500]  We're going to, you would have told me go smoke a joint, get over it, bro.
[10:45.500 --> 10:46.500]  That's what he would have said.
[10:46.500 --> 10:47.500]  That's probably the right.
[10:47.500 --> 10:48.500]  That's what he would have said.
[10:48.500 --> 10:52.500]  He's one of the, uh, so I wasn't going to talk about my uncle for too long, but this
[10:52.500 --> 10:53.500]  is where this goes.
[10:53.500 --> 10:56.500]  Uh, when I was younger, my uncles had a lot to do with my life.
[10:56.500 --> 10:57.500]  They were rowdy bunch.
[10:57.500 --> 10:58.500]  They were like me now.
[10:58.500 --> 10:59.500]  You know what I mean?
[10:59.500 --> 11:00.500]  There that's, this is what I learned.
[11:00.500 --> 11:01.500]  It is from them.
[11:02.500 --> 11:05.500]  Uh, they were always the stoners in the back room smoking a joint.
[11:05.500 --> 11:07.500]  So one day we're driving to a concert.
[11:07.500 --> 11:08.500]  They took me to my first real concert.
[11:08.500 --> 11:11.500]  They're playing Metallica in the fucking car and they don't realize that I've been around
[11:11.500 --> 11:15.500]  some stoners already, but they're smoking a joint up front and they don't realize how
[11:15.500 --> 11:17.500]  stoned I got in the back of that fucking car.
[11:17.500 --> 11:18.500]  Yeah.
[11:18.500 --> 11:21.500]  It was baked and we went to a concert, had the best time.
[11:21.500 --> 11:24.500]  And I think they might've realized I was stoned.
[11:24.500 --> 11:29.500]  And because after that they started offering to smoke with me and, and they played, uh,
[11:29.500 --> 11:31.500]  Metallica, the black album on that ride.
[11:31.500 --> 11:33.500]  And that's part of why I became a drummer.
[11:33.500 --> 11:35.500]  So that dude had a lot to do with my life.
[11:35.500 --> 11:36.500]  We'll move forward.
[11:36.500 --> 11:38.500]  Talk from talking about my uncle, but big shout out.
[11:38.500 --> 11:39.500]  Uh, thanks for all the love you guys.
[11:39.500 --> 11:43.500]  Um, the next note says Clint is here, but you guys know that Clint's here by now.
[11:43.500 --> 11:44.500]  Hi guys.
[11:44.500 --> 11:45.500]  How you doing, bro?
[11:45.500 --> 11:46.500]  I'm doing pretty good, man.
[11:46.500 --> 11:47.500]  Good, man.
[11:47.500 --> 11:48.500]  Thanks for coming over.
[11:48.500 --> 11:49.500]  A short, short notice.
[11:49.500 --> 11:50.500]  I was like, you want to have it me?
[11:50.500 --> 11:51.500]  Oh dude.
[11:51.500 --> 11:52.500]  Yeah.
[11:52.500 --> 11:53.500]  Thanks for driving.
[11:53.500 --> 11:54.500]  You live like 30 minutes away, bro.
[11:54.500 --> 11:56.500]  Well, you know, you're going to make time for the things that are important for you.
[11:56.500 --> 11:57.500]  I appreciate that.
[11:57.500 --> 11:58.500]  Thank you.
[11:58.500 --> 11:59.500]  Same city, 30 minutes away.
[11:59.500 --> 12:02.500]  That's like, no, you just say, fuck you on the show.
[12:02.500 --> 12:03.500]  Fuck you.
[12:03.500 --> 12:04.500]  I don't censor yourself for me.
[12:04.500 --> 12:05.500]  Be yourself, dude.
[12:05.500 --> 12:06.500]  Do it for these guys.
[12:06.500 --> 12:07.500]  Be yourself.
[12:07.500 --> 12:09.500]  I'm going to keep a family friendly watch.
[12:09.500 --> 12:11.500]  No, this is not a family friendly show.
[12:11.500 --> 12:12.500]  We do not claim to be family.
[12:12.500 --> 12:13.500]  No, don't worry about that.
[12:13.500 --> 12:14.500]  Man.
[12:14.500 --> 12:15.500]  Thanks for coming.
[12:15.500 --> 12:16.500]  The beard is gnarly, bro.
[12:16.500 --> 12:17.500]  Thank you, sir.
[12:17.500 --> 12:18.500]  Who trimmed that for you?
[12:18.500 --> 12:19.500]  Did you do that?
[12:19.500 --> 12:20.500]  Oh, I had a lady do it.
[12:20.500 --> 12:21.500]  Nice.
[12:21.500 --> 12:22.500]  That helps.
[12:22.500 --> 12:25.500]  I was going to ask if you paid that lady, but someone will edit this conversation to
[12:25.500 --> 12:27.500]  make it a two bears one cave conversation.
[12:27.500 --> 12:28.500]  We don't need none of that.
[12:28.500 --> 12:32.500]  Yeah, I don't need to be saying bad things about the nice lady that trimmed my beard.
[12:32.500 --> 12:34.500]  Going to get me threed.
[12:34.500 --> 12:37.500]  Yeah, I don't need that, but that show is funny.
[12:37.500 --> 12:39.500]  Yeah, two bears, one cave.
[12:39.500 --> 12:40.500]  You guys check that shit out.
[12:40.500 --> 12:42.500]  Bert and Tom, Tom and Bert.
[12:42.500 --> 12:44.500]  One goes topless, the other wears a shirt.
[12:44.500 --> 12:50.500]  This is the last Grow From Your Heart podcast episode of this year.
[12:50.500 --> 12:52.500]  It's not the final episode.
[12:52.500 --> 12:55.500]  It is the last episode of 2020.
[12:55.500 --> 12:56.500]  No, 2019.
[12:56.500 --> 12:57.500]  I wrote 2020 on the paper.
[12:57.500 --> 12:58.500]  Uh-oh.
[12:58.500 --> 12:59.500]  We time traveled.
[12:59.500 --> 13:00.500]  Sorry, I'm sorry.
[13:00.500 --> 13:03.500]  Dude, it's the last episode of 2019.
[13:03.500 --> 13:06.500]  Yeah, the last episode of 2019.
[13:06.500 --> 13:08.500]  Episode 500 is coming up.
[13:08.500 --> 13:09.500]  That's fun.
[13:09.500 --> 13:10.500]  Yeah.
[13:10.500 --> 13:12.500]  I've got two things to branch off of that.
[13:12.500 --> 13:17.500]  Since this is the last episode of the year and we've got 2020 coming up.
[13:17.500 --> 13:18.500]  Sorry, I said the wrong year.
[13:18.500 --> 13:19.500]  I might have thought.
[13:19.500 --> 13:22.500]  Some people are looking at their calendars and freaking the fuck out right now.
[13:22.500 --> 13:25.500]  Well, they should because we just all time traveled.
[13:25.500 --> 13:26.500]  We're back.
[13:26.500 --> 13:27.500]  Back to the future.
[13:27.500 --> 13:29.500]  Set some goals.
[13:29.500 --> 13:30.500]  That's what I think you should do.
[13:30.500 --> 13:32.500]  Set some goals for 2020.
[13:32.500 --> 13:34.500]  If it's, I mean, this is a Grow Show.
[13:34.500 --> 13:37.500]  I encourage you to do something better in your garden.
[13:37.500 --> 13:38.500]  What do you suck at?
[13:38.500 --> 13:39.500]  Are you not good at cloning?
[13:39.500 --> 13:40.500]  Are you not good at trimming?
[13:40.500 --> 13:42.500]  Do you not know how to tell when to harvest?
[13:42.500 --> 13:44.500]  Are you really bad at telling when you've got bugs?
[13:44.500 --> 13:45.500]  Get better at that.
[13:45.500 --> 13:49.500]  Find something, find your weakness, find your weak link and improve upon that.
[13:49.500 --> 13:52.500]  Find your skill which you lack in in the garden and brush up on it.
[13:52.500 --> 13:53.500]  You can get good at it.
[13:53.500 --> 13:56.500]  There are books, there are websites, there are podcast episodes,
[13:56.500 --> 14:01.500]  there are standard operating procedures written on just about every step of the grow.
[14:01.500 --> 14:07.500]  You can improve and make your weak link your strongest link and improve your entire growth.
[14:07.500 --> 14:08.500]  So set some goals.
[14:08.500 --> 14:10.500]  That would be my recommendation for the garden.
[14:10.500 --> 14:13.500]  Find what you're sucking at and do better at it.
[14:13.500 --> 14:14.500]  Get out of your comfort zone.
[14:14.500 --> 14:18.500]  Like if you're really good at throwing sidekicks but you're no good at sweeps,
[14:18.500 --> 14:20.500]  just work on sweeps until you're good at it.
[14:20.500 --> 14:23.500]  You get better at everything in life by working at something you suck at.
[14:23.500 --> 14:27.500]  If you go play the video game that you're really good at and play the level you're really good at
[14:27.500 --> 14:30.500]  and smoke everybody all day, you're just feeding your fucking ego.
[14:30.500 --> 14:33.500]  If you go play the level that's hard and you play against harder people,
[14:33.500 --> 14:34.500]  you're feeding your soul.
[14:34.500 --> 14:36.500]  So go feed your soul a little bit.
[14:36.500 --> 14:37.500]  Defeating your ego is tough.
[14:37.500 --> 14:38.500]  It's so hard, dude.
[14:38.500 --> 14:40.500]  Clint and I have been having some conversations,
[14:40.500 --> 14:43.500]  some existential conversations about life here.
[14:43.500 --> 14:44.500]  We're pretty good friends.
[14:44.500 --> 14:48.500]  Yeah, we're good friends and we're both approaching a different age of life.
[14:48.500 --> 14:49.500]  You know what I mean?
[14:49.500 --> 14:51.500]  We're both, I'm fucking 40, bro.
[14:51.500 --> 14:53.500]  People probably don't know that when they see me and listen to the show.
[14:53.500 --> 14:54.500]  A lot of people think I'm younger.
[14:54.500 --> 14:55.500]  I'm right behind you.
[14:55.500 --> 14:58.500]  Yeah, I'm a 40-year-old man, so I've got a lot of different insight lately.
[14:58.500 --> 15:00.500]  People have passed away in my life and things have changed.
[15:00.500 --> 15:03.500]  So definitely one of those introspective type of months.
[15:03.500 --> 15:05.500]  Clint and I have had some great conversations.
[15:05.500 --> 15:07.500]  I'm going to get myself back on track here.
[15:07.500 --> 15:08.500]  We're going to get fucking stoned and rambly.
[15:08.500 --> 15:09.500]  Set some goals, you guys.
[15:09.500 --> 15:10.500]  Set some goals in the garden.
[15:10.500 --> 15:14.500]  You're only as good as your weakest part, so get good at everything.
[15:14.500 --> 15:15.500]  Get good at that shit.
[15:15.500 --> 15:17.500]  Work on some soul-building skills.
[15:17.500 --> 15:19.500]  Then also, where do you suck at in life?
[15:19.500 --> 15:20.500]  What are you fucking up?
[15:20.500 --> 15:21.500]  Do that better next year.
[15:21.500 --> 15:23.500]  Just be honest with yourself first.
[15:23.500 --> 15:25.500]  That may be the first step.
[15:25.500 --> 15:28.500]  Maybe that's what you suck at, is being honest with yourself.
[15:28.500 --> 15:30.500]  Dude, I think that's ego, man.
[15:30.500 --> 15:31.500]  Yep.
[15:31.500 --> 15:35.500]  Okay, so I guess my answer is work on ego.
[15:35.500 --> 15:36.500]  There we go.
[15:36.500 --> 15:37.500]  We know what Clint needs to work on.
[15:37.500 --> 15:39.500]  I just always have.
[15:39.500 --> 15:41.500]  I think I take on too many things.
[15:41.500 --> 15:46.500]  I try to satisfy the demands of too many different sources.
[15:47.500 --> 15:51.500]  I don't mind trying to do it, but sometimes I dig myself a hole because I make too many
[15:51.500 --> 15:56.500]  commitments that I mean well trying to do so many things, but I can only do so many.
[15:56.500 --> 16:01.500]  I end up doing 10 things 90% as well as I could have if I would have only chosen to
[16:01.500 --> 16:02.500]  do eight things 100%.
[16:02.500 --> 16:04.500]  That's one of my downfalls.
[16:04.500 --> 16:05.500]  It's something I should work on.
[16:05.500 --> 16:07.500]  Set some goals, you guys.
[16:07.500 --> 16:08.500]  We've got some goals we can work on.
[16:08.500 --> 16:12.500]  It doesn't have to be like, I want to make $1,000 doing this, or I want to buy a new
[16:12.500 --> 16:13.500]  car.
[16:13.500 --> 16:14.500]  If that's what you want, that could be your goal.
[16:14.500 --> 16:15.500]  It could be something really little.
[16:15.500 --> 16:17.500]  It can be something really large.
[16:17.500 --> 16:22.500]  If you struggle just sticking to a commitment, maybe that's your new New Year's goal.
[16:22.500 --> 16:24.500]  You don't have to set a goal on the New Year.
[16:24.500 --> 16:27.500]  You can start today, start right now, but set some goals for your life.
[16:27.500 --> 16:32.500]  Set some goals for yourself and then write them down because if you don't write it down,
[16:32.500 --> 16:33.500]  it's just an imagination.
[16:33.500 --> 16:34.500]  It's just a thought.
[16:34.500 --> 16:38.500]  You got to put it on some paper and then put that paper where you're going to look at it.
[16:38.500 --> 16:39.500]  Put it next to your money.
[16:39.500 --> 16:40.500]  Put it on the fridge.
[16:40.500 --> 16:41.500]  Put it next to your weed.
[16:41.500 --> 16:43.500]  Just write just a couple of words.
[16:43.500 --> 16:46.500]  If you're one of those, if you want to go real far and be one of those vision board
[16:46.500 --> 16:48.500]  people, do that.
[16:48.500 --> 16:49.500]  I just write words.
[16:49.500 --> 16:53.500]  I just got a couple of words and those words remind me every day of, oh yeah, like do these
[16:53.500 --> 16:54.500]  things.
[16:54.500 --> 16:55.500]  Got to keep the hustle on.
[16:55.500 --> 16:56.500]  Keep moving.
[16:56.500 --> 16:57.500]  Stay strong.
[16:57.500 --> 16:59.500]  Keep your mind strong and keep your mental health strong.
[16:59.500 --> 17:03.500]  Keep your body strong and reach your goals, but keep something around to inspire you and
[17:03.500 --> 17:04.500]  remind you of all of those things.
[17:04.500 --> 17:05.500]  Yeah.
[17:05.500 --> 17:06.500]  Be humble.
[17:06.500 --> 17:08.500]  It's easy to forget.
[17:08.500 --> 17:12.500]  People, a lot of people like to wear the, there are different pieces of religious jewelry
[17:12.500 --> 17:13.500]  that people wear.
[17:13.500 --> 17:16.500]  I'm not going to mention, I don't want to leave anybody out or include anybody, but
[17:16.500 --> 17:19.500]  people have religious things that hang on their body or adorn themselves with it.
[17:19.500 --> 17:20.500]  Remind them of that.
[17:20.500 --> 17:22.500]  People have those, what would Jesus do bracelets?
[17:22.500 --> 17:26.500]  Something, just something like that, that you see on an occasion.
[17:26.500 --> 17:28.500]  So you just go, oh yeah, I've got this here.
[17:28.500 --> 17:31.500]  A lot of people wear a necklace with a certain shape on it.
[17:31.500 --> 17:35.500]  I don't care what you choose to wear, but there are certain shapes of people that represent
[17:35.500 --> 17:36.500]  certain things to them.
[17:36.500 --> 17:37.500]  Put one of those on you.
[17:37.500 --> 17:38.500]  Just remind me, I got to be good.
[17:38.500 --> 17:39.500]  I got to do my stuff.
[17:39.500 --> 17:42.500]  I got to do my, my mental chores, my physical chores and get to my goals.
[17:42.500 --> 17:44.500]  Try to get to some goals this year.
[17:44.500 --> 17:46.500]  Be nice to yourself too.
[17:46.500 --> 17:47.500]  Yeah.
[17:47.500 --> 17:49.500]  Don't, if you're not going to reach your goals, don't beat yourself up.
[17:49.500 --> 17:50.500]  You try it.
[17:50.500 --> 17:51.500]  Just do your best.
[17:51.500 --> 17:52.500]  Hey, just take a step towards it.
[17:52.500 --> 17:53.500]  Yeah.
[17:53.500 --> 17:54.500]  That's, that's all.
[17:54.500 --> 17:55.500]  Okay.
[17:55.500 --> 17:56.500]  I'm not your dad.
[17:56.500 --> 17:57.500]  Have fun.
[17:57.500 --> 17:58.500]  Live your life.
[17:58.500 --> 17:59.500]  But these are good aspirations.
[17:59.500 --> 18:00.500]  Yeah.
[18:00.500 --> 18:01.500]  Yeah.
[18:01.500 --> 18:06.500]  This turned into a different kind of podcast than usual, but sets of goals, write them
[18:06.500 --> 18:07.500]  down.
[18:07.500 --> 18:08.500]  Impress yourself.
[18:08.500 --> 18:09.500]  Go try and impress everybody else.
[18:09.500 --> 18:10.500]  Go try and impress everybody else.
[18:10.500 --> 18:11.500]  Uh, the internet doesn't care.
[18:11.500 --> 18:15.500]  Uh, we're just doing shit for likes and clicks and what does it get you to get you likes
[18:15.500 --> 18:17.500]  and clicks and that's all you got.
[18:17.500 --> 18:18.500]  Once you log out, you ain't got shit left.
[18:18.500 --> 18:21.500]  So how many likes did you get on that post two months ago?
[18:21.500 --> 18:22.500]  I don't even remember.
[18:22.500 --> 18:23.500]  Exactly.
[18:23.500 --> 18:26.500]  I think it may be better that Instagram has taken off the amount of likes.
[18:26.500 --> 18:29.500]  It doesn't show you how many likes you get on your posts and I think it may be healthier
[18:29.500 --> 18:30.500]  for people.
[18:30.500 --> 18:31.500]  I hope so.
[18:31.500 --> 18:37.500]  There's a disease going through just, uh, humans right now with the way we're using
[18:38.500 --> 18:39.500]  phones.
[18:39.500 --> 18:40.500]  I'm sorry.
[18:40.500 --> 18:42.500]  I derail in this damn screens, bro.
[18:42.500 --> 18:43.500]  No screens.
[18:43.500 --> 18:47.500]  We went to a comedy show and we went to a comedy show at a very large, uh, the Denver
[18:47.500 --> 18:49.500]  convention centers, however that place is.
[18:49.500 --> 18:50.500]  Yeah, that's right.
[18:50.500 --> 18:55.500]  So the Belco theater is hidden inside the Denver convention center inside the Denver
[18:55.500 --> 19:01.500]  convention center is basically a six foot by nine foot iPad and it's interactive.
[19:01.500 --> 19:02.500]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[19:02.500 --> 19:07.500]  And Clint and I were hanging out and I found us both mesmerized by this big screen.
[19:07.500 --> 19:11.500]  They didn't do anything really except you could press here and tell it where you want
[19:11.500 --> 19:14.500]  to go and it would draw you a map from here to here.
[19:14.500 --> 19:16.500]  We knew how to get there.
[19:16.500 --> 19:18.500]  We're, we're fucking smart people.
[19:18.500 --> 19:21.500]  We can fucking walk from point A to point B pretty well.
[19:21.500 --> 19:23.500]  It's pretty neat seeing the future stuff though.
[19:23.500 --> 19:25.500]  We were just mesmerized by that thing.
[19:25.500 --> 19:28.500]  There was a list of things you cannot take into the comedy show.
[19:29.500 --> 19:32.500]  We read the whole list just because it was on some interactive screen.
[19:32.500 --> 19:33.500]  We didn't care.
[19:33.500 --> 19:34.500]  We didn't give a shit.
[19:34.500 --> 19:36.500]  We couldn't, we didn't have any of those things.
[19:36.500 --> 19:37.500]  We didn't care.
[19:37.500 --> 19:38.500]  There was no chance we had any of that.
[19:38.500 --> 19:40.500]  It was still pretty neat.
[19:40.500 --> 19:42.500]  Yeah, we just still just screens.
[19:42.500 --> 19:43.500]  I was probably pretty stoned too.
[19:43.500 --> 19:46.500]  So, oh yeah, we were going to see Tommy Buns or Joe Rogan.
[19:46.500 --> 19:48.500]  So we were definitely heavily medicated.
[19:48.500 --> 19:50.500]  I think that was Joe Rogan that time.
[19:50.500 --> 19:51.500]  Yeah.
[19:51.500 --> 19:55.500]  Because we were pretty wiped out when we were going to see Tommy Buns.
[19:55.500 --> 19:56.500]  Yeah.
[19:56.500 --> 20:00.500]  Have you seen the guy with pothead tattooed across his forehead?
[20:00.500 --> 20:03.500]  I think that guy looks a lot like Jeff Tate.
[20:03.500 --> 20:05.500]  There's a guy you'll see him on social media.
[20:05.500 --> 20:08.500]  He's got the word pothead and he's got joints for eyebrows.
[20:08.500 --> 20:10.500]  Oh, yeah.
[20:10.500 --> 20:12.500]  What else was I going to say?
[20:12.500 --> 20:13.500]  Right. Set some goals, you guys.
[20:13.500 --> 20:14.500]  It doesn't have to be in the grow.
[20:14.500 --> 20:17.500]  Just set some goals and you don't have to beat yourself up over it.
[20:17.500 --> 20:19.500]  It doesn't have to be anything amazing.
[20:19.500 --> 20:23.500]  Do one thing, do something one last time, do something one more time.
[20:23.500 --> 20:24.500]  Whatever.
[20:24.500 --> 20:27.500]  Just improve in some way, shape or form and be honest with yourself about it.
[20:27.500 --> 20:31.500]  And then also remember that social media is just a game and you don't have to win.
[20:31.500 --> 20:32.500]  Nobody wins.
[20:32.500 --> 20:34.500]  Quit trying to impress everybody on social media.
[20:34.500 --> 20:36.500]  You'll be much happier.
[20:36.500 --> 20:39.500]  Then episode 500 is coming.
[20:39.500 --> 20:43.500]  It'll be toward the end of January if my scheduling is appropriate.
[20:43.500 --> 20:44.500]  Oh, my goodness.
[20:44.500 --> 20:45.500]  What else is at the end of January?
[20:45.500 --> 20:46.500]  Oh, goodness.
[20:46.500 --> 20:47.500]  It's crazy that you asked.
[20:47.500 --> 20:48.500]  I just dropped my pen.
[20:48.500 --> 20:49.500]  I was trying to do the David Letterman trick.
[20:49.500 --> 20:55.500]  The other thing is the Endo Expo, January 25th and 26th at the Denver Mart, Denver, Colorado.
[20:55.500 --> 20:56.500]  I'm at booth.
[20:56.500 --> 20:57.500]  I'm in a booth.
[20:57.500 --> 20:58.500]  Come say hi.
[20:58.500 --> 20:59.500]  I forgot my booth number.
[20:59.500 --> 21:00.500]  I've got it written down somewhere.
[21:00.500 --> 21:04.500]  I will be posting that to the social media so that everybody can find that stuff.
[21:04.500 --> 21:06.500]  But the Endo Expo, yeah, come check us out.
[21:06.500 --> 21:07.500]  That should be a really good time.
[21:07.500 --> 21:10.500]  I've been packing up things for days.
[21:10.500 --> 21:13.500]  Dude, there's a, there's a.
[21:13.500 --> 21:14.500]  So rumor has it.
[21:14.500 --> 21:16.500]  You've got quite the selection.
[21:16.500 --> 21:17.500]  Thank you.
[21:17.500 --> 21:18.500]  I appreciate that.
[21:18.500 --> 21:21.500]  Yes, I think there are 20 items on the menu.
[21:21.500 --> 21:22.500]  Whoa.
[21:22.500 --> 21:28.500]  There's a rumor that this guy Clint may show up at the Endo Expo and could be at my booth
[21:28.500 --> 21:30.500]  for some time at some point.
[21:30.500 --> 21:32.500]  I mean, I heard that same rumor.
[21:32.500 --> 21:33.500]  I hear that.
[21:33.500 --> 21:40.500]  And also, I don't want to confirm anything, but I also hear that white Mike may be at
[21:40.500 --> 21:41.500]  the booth.
[21:41.500 --> 21:44.500]  So people should come by and say, what's up to Clint?
[21:44.500 --> 21:47.500]  Clint's the tall guy missing a tooth and white, white, white Mike.
[21:47.500 --> 21:48.500]  That was harder to say than it was supposed to be.
[21:48.500 --> 21:53.500]  I'm not even going to edit that white Mike is the tall guy with the glasses on the earrings.
[21:53.500 --> 21:54.500]  Come say hi.
[21:54.500 --> 21:55.500]  Yeah.
[21:55.500 --> 21:56.500]  Keep calling him Clint.
[21:56.500 --> 21:57.500]  It'll be fun.
[21:57.500 --> 21:58.500]  I'm the, I'm the tall white guy with dreadlocks.
[21:58.500 --> 21:59.500]  I'm easy to spot.
[21:59.500 --> 22:01.500]  Come say what's up the Endo Expo.
[22:01.500 --> 22:04.500]  Um, but yeah, I was, I was more focused on that.
[22:04.500 --> 22:05.500]  That's going to be a fun time.
[22:05.500 --> 22:07.500]  That's going to be chaotic and fun.
[22:07.500 --> 22:10.500]  Get your tickets early, make your travel plans, book your hotels, all that good stuff.
[22:10.500 --> 22:11.500]  Yeah.
[22:11.500 --> 22:12.500]  I'm excited.
[22:12.500 --> 22:13.500]  That's going to be fun, man.
[22:13.500 --> 22:14.500]  Yeah.
[22:14.500 --> 22:15.500]  I cannot wait.
[22:15.500 --> 22:19.780]  I mean, before we get there, I've got to record episode 500 before I can even leave for the
[22:19.780 --> 22:20.780]  Endo Expo.
[22:20.780 --> 22:22.500]  It's got to be recorded before I get in the car for that.
[22:22.500 --> 22:25.500]  I think it comes out the Monday after the Endo Expo.
[22:25.500 --> 22:26.500]  Yeah.
[22:26.500 --> 22:28.500]  So we've got to have it pre pre-recorded, ready to rock.
[22:28.500 --> 22:30.000]  That's not hard to do.
[22:30.000 --> 22:31.260]  No, I could do that.
[22:31.260 --> 22:36.740]  But what I'm reaching out for is I would like my listeners, my friends, my audience, you,
[22:36.740 --> 22:40.420]  you who are listening, I would like you to give me your ideas.
[22:40.420 --> 22:42.100]  What we going to do for 500.
[22:42.100 --> 22:43.580]  I don't know what to do for episode 500.
[22:43.660 --> 22:45.900]  Do we just do a normal episode?
[22:45.900 --> 22:48.380]  Do I invite Clint and Mike and possibly Kevin over?
[22:48.380 --> 22:49.380]  Do we just record?
[22:49.380 --> 22:51.740]  Do we just do a normal grow episode?
[22:51.740 --> 22:54.180]  What would you like on episode 500?
[22:54.180 --> 22:57.140]  And I know I've been promising that mix episode.
[22:57.140 --> 22:58.980]  I'll turn to the pages right now so that Clint can see.
[22:58.980 --> 22:59.980]  Look at all that.
[22:59.980 --> 23:00.980]  Look at all those notes.
[23:00.980 --> 23:01.980]  That should exist, right?
[23:01.980 --> 23:02.980]  Yeah.
[23:02.980 --> 23:03.980]  Yeah.
[23:03.980 --> 23:04.980]  It's like five pages there.
[23:04.980 --> 23:05.980]  That's a real, that's the mix episode.
[23:05.980 --> 23:06.980]  It's written.
[23:06.980 --> 23:09.460]  I will record that.
[23:09.460 --> 23:12.740]  I've got my head back on my shoulders most of the way there will be a service and a funeral
[23:12.900 --> 23:16.100]  here, but right after that, I'll be able to start working on more episodes back to back.
[23:16.100 --> 23:17.580]  I'll get that mix episode out.
[23:17.580 --> 23:18.580]  But what do we do for 500?
[23:18.580 --> 23:20.540]  You guys, what are we going to do?
[23:20.540 --> 23:24.340]  This is like four 93, uh, just a couple of weeks to put it together.
[23:24.340 --> 23:25.340]  Yeah.
[23:25.340 --> 23:26.340]  A couple of weeks.
[23:26.340 --> 23:27.340]  I can throw a show together quickly.
[23:27.340 --> 23:29.300]  I just need some ideas, some inputs and feedback.
[23:29.300 --> 23:30.300]  What would you guys like?
[23:30.300 --> 23:31.300]  Help me out.
[23:31.300 --> 23:32.460]  I'll make it happen for you.
[23:32.460 --> 23:38.440]  I mean, just even an idea that you have seen somebody else do.
[23:38.440 --> 23:39.440]  Maybe it's a good idea.
[23:39.440 --> 23:40.440]  Yeah.
[23:40.440 --> 23:41.440]  Give us a shout out.
[23:41.440 --> 23:42.440]  Yeah.
[23:43.140 --> 23:47.480]  Send me your feedback at grow from your heart at hotmail.com is probably the best way to
[23:47.480 --> 23:48.480]  get in touch with me.
[23:48.480 --> 23:49.480]  Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[23:49.480 --> 23:54.400]  I like that look on your face Clint.
[23:54.400 --> 23:55.400]  Very professional look.
[23:55.400 --> 23:56.400]  Oh great.
[23:56.400 --> 24:01.760]  Uh, bro, we've been going for like a good 25 minutes now.
[24:01.760 --> 24:05.640]  Um, I don't think we should open any more Pandora's boxes and get rambling and start
[24:05.640 --> 24:07.080]  talking about too much stuff here.
[24:07.080 --> 24:08.240]  I don't have any more notes.
[24:08.240 --> 24:09.920]  Do you have anything you would like to say?
[24:09.920 --> 24:14.160]  Well, you've got a microphone and a small audience, a small audience.
[24:14.160 --> 24:15.700]  It's growing, man.
[24:15.700 --> 24:21.520]  It's so nice to have like been a part of something that's growing like this, you know, cause
[24:21.520 --> 24:24.040]  I'm just supporting on the sidelines for the most part.
[24:24.040 --> 24:25.040]  Yeah.
[24:25.040 --> 24:26.040]  Well, you're a great supporter.
[24:26.040 --> 24:27.600]  Uh, you're not a cannabis grower.
[24:27.600 --> 24:31.760]  Uh, you are part of the cannabis community because you do consume and it's been fun watching
[24:31.760 --> 24:37.400]  you go from, I don't smoke to, I kind of smoke to, I smoke pretty decently now.
[24:37.400 --> 24:38.400]  Yeah.
[24:38.400 --> 24:39.400]  Like you can keep up.
[24:39.880 --> 24:40.880]  That's okay.
[24:40.880 --> 24:43.000]  We're not going to twist your arm, but I appreciate the support, man.
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.760]  I need all kinds of members on my team, cheerleaders and fucking quarterbacks.
[24:46.760 --> 24:47.760]  I need them all.
[24:47.760 --> 24:48.760]  So I appreciate it.
[24:48.760 --> 24:49.760]  Thanks for being a good cheerleader.
[24:49.760 --> 24:51.920]  Fucking, you know, you're going to do what you're going to do, man.
[24:51.920 --> 24:52.920]  And you're here, man.
[24:52.920 --> 24:53.920]  You're here.
[24:53.920 --> 24:54.920]  So that's, what's important.
[24:54.920 --> 24:55.920]  That's what friends are for.
[24:55.920 --> 24:56.920]  Yeah.
[24:56.920 --> 24:57.920]  Uh, what else are you going to say, bro?
[24:57.920 --> 25:00.240]  Uh, you know, give your mom a hug for me.
[25:00.240 --> 25:01.240]  I like it.
[25:01.240 --> 25:02.240]  That's what friends are for.
[25:02.240 --> 25:03.240]  It should have been where I left you.
[25:03.240 --> 25:05.160]  You were fucking doing just fine right there.
[25:05.160 --> 25:06.680]  You guys, this was a fun episode.
[25:06.680 --> 25:10.320]  I just wanted to come and have Clint on the show and just kind of hang out and record
[25:10.320 --> 25:11.320]  a little bit.
[25:11.320 --> 25:13.560]  Tell everybody, thank you for all the love and support you've been giving me while I'm
[25:13.560 --> 25:16.280]  going through some weird shit with my uncle passing away.
[25:16.280 --> 25:17.920]  I'm okay because I'm going to be all right.
[25:17.920 --> 25:20.600]  I've got no other choice than to be all right, but I'm all right.
[25:20.600 --> 25:21.600]  Clint's here.
[25:21.600 --> 25:22.920]  I kind of had a lot of good friends pass through and say hi.
[25:22.920 --> 25:25.880]  The holidays were, uh, being with my family made the holidays a lot better.
[25:25.880 --> 25:26.880]  It kind of brought us together.
[25:26.880 --> 25:27.880]  That was kind of cool.
[25:27.880 --> 25:31.480]  Had Christmas dinner and by the end of Christmas dinner, I think we all felt a little bit of
[25:31.480 --> 25:36.000]  relief like just being together and telling some stories and laughing and talking shit.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.120]  That's what my uncle would have wanted us to get together.
[25:40.120 --> 25:42.200]  His two sisters and his brothers were there.
[25:42.200 --> 25:45.320]  So we're just talking shit about him and each other just like it should have been.
[25:45.320 --> 25:46.320]  You know what I mean?
[25:46.320 --> 25:47.320]  Just like it should have been.
[25:47.320 --> 25:48.600]  It took a minute to get there, but once we got there, it was great.
[25:48.600 --> 25:49.600]  It was what we needed.
[25:49.600 --> 25:50.600]  So we're going to be all right, you guys.
[25:50.600 --> 25:51.600]  I appreciate it.
[25:51.600 --> 25:53.520]  I send all of the love back to you.
[25:53.520 --> 25:54.520]  Thank you.
[25:54.520 --> 25:56.720]  Um, you know, let's do this part of the show.
[25:56.720 --> 25:58.120]  Uh, Clint, thanks for hanging out, dude.

[25:59.120 --> 26:00.120]  You're welcome, brother.
[26:00.120 --> 26:01.560]  Clint and I are going to hang out for a few minutes after the show.
