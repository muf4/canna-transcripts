[00:17.400 --> 00:21.920]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community. It's time for episode number 104 of the Grow From
[00:21.920 --> 00:26.480]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:26.480 --> 00:31.000]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:31.000 --> 00:35.080]  or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:35.080 --> 00:40.080]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friend, is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:40.080 --> 00:44.000]  host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.800]  always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots band for letting me
[00:47.800 --> 00:53.440]  use their music on my show. Big thanks to Cap, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.440 --> 00:57.640]  I'm back in the studio, you guys, and I'm putting this episode out as a regular Monday
[00:57.640 --> 01:02.000]  episode. So good morning. I hope you're having a great Monday. Sometimes Mondays can be a
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.480]  real bitch, so I hope I make it a little bit better with the fresh episode of the Grow
[01:05.480 --> 01:09.720]  From Your Heart podcast. If it's not Monday for you, whenever you're listening to this,
[01:09.720 --> 01:13.720]  I hope you're having a great day. I hope you've got a fat joint rolled. I hope you got a blunt
[01:13.720 --> 01:17.000]  rolled. I hope you got a dab ready. I hope you got a bowl packed. I hope you got the
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.600]  vaporizer filled up. I hope you got something going on. Maybe you're eating some edibles.
[01:21.600 --> 01:25.600]  Maybe you're using some cannabis lubrication or possibly a cannabis suppository. Whatever
[01:25.600 --> 01:28.760]  it is, I hope it's working great for you. I hope you're working in the garden. I hope
[01:28.760 --> 01:31.900]  you're driving in the car. Whatever you're doing, I'm hoping that I'm making your day
[01:31.900 --> 01:36.840]  a little bit better. Thanks for joining me, you guys. I'm back in the studio. Last time
[01:36.840 --> 01:42.560]  I was on, I did an episode from the car, and I did a review on the G-Pen Slim Disposable
[01:42.640 --> 01:48.360]  Vaporizer. I used the concentrate version. When I was in the car, I gave this thing a
[01:48.360 --> 01:52.680]  shitty review, but let me tell you, that was a preemptive strike. I got home, and I looked
[01:52.680 --> 01:57.400]  at it a little bit. All I had to do was pack the hash in a little bit harder, press it
[01:57.400 --> 02:03.720]  down and heat it up a little bit, and it actually gave me quite a few fat rips. I'm going to,
[02:03.720 --> 02:08.800]  what is it called, withdraw my shitty review of this product, and I'm going to update it,
[02:08.800 --> 02:13.640]  and I'm going to give it four out of five stars. For a vape pen that's disposable, this
[02:13.640 --> 02:18.760]  is probably the best quality we're going to find, so four out of five stars. For a dab
[02:18.760 --> 02:24.000]  or a wax hit or a concentrate hit, I prefer a rig. You need a rig for five stars, but
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  it's a good product. If you're in Colorado, and you're picking up some concentrates, and
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.480]  you need something to smoke it through, these little yellow vape pens that you're going
[02:31.480 --> 02:36.720]  to throw away when you're done, I think these are an affordable and economical deal. I apologize
[02:36.720 --> 02:42.040]  for the shitty review. My updated review says it's a quality product. All right. I
[02:42.040 --> 02:45.800]  want to give the whole nation a shout out. Everybody in America, this is for you, you
[02:45.800 --> 02:50.720]  guys. Halloween just passed, and guess how many people reported finding cannabis-laced
[02:50.720 --> 02:56.140]  candy in their children's Halloween basket? Nobody. That's right. There were zero reports
[02:56.140 --> 03:00.200]  of cannabis-laced candy given out for Halloween this year, so a big shout out. We did the
[03:00.200 --> 03:03.960]  same shout out last year, but I wanted to do it again, because you're doing a good job.
[03:03.960 --> 03:09.200]  You guys, please don't ever give children, animals, anybody cannabis-infused candy without
[03:09.200 --> 03:13.600]  their knowledge. If your pet's using it for medicine, do that with discretion. I can't
[03:13.600 --> 03:17.280]  judge you there. They do make medicine for your dog now. It's infused with cannabis,
[03:17.280 --> 03:20.840]  but don't do it just to get your dog fucked up. That's rude. You guys, keep us on a good
[03:20.840 --> 03:25.000]  streak. Keep the recreational cannabis going well for us. All right. So, shout out.
[03:26.640 --> 03:30.120]  So, you guys, I was at the Champs Trade Show. If you listened to the other episode, I'm
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.000]  sure you heard about that, but I was at the Champs Trade Show over the weekend, or it
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.160]  was actually during the week, and I noticed something. There is a really tight-knit, really
[03:40.160 --> 03:44.960]  close little community that travels around to all of the cannabis shows, and they set
[03:44.960 --> 03:49.480]  up their booths, and they take great care of the customers and the community, and they
[03:49.480 --> 03:54.920]  really represent the cannabis movement, the cannabis product movement, the cannabis industry
[03:54.920 --> 03:59.360]  in a positive light. And I just want to give a big shout out to all those people. They
[03:59.360 --> 04:02.920]  know who they are. I don't need to point them out specifically. If you were part of
[04:02.920 --> 04:07.800]  that cannabis movement that comes to the events, that goes to the events, that is part of the
[04:07.800 --> 04:12.680]  product development, the advancement of the products, if you're there showing your face,
[04:12.680 --> 04:15.920]  if we see each other and high-five each other and don't even have to talk, you're part of
[04:15.920 --> 04:19.520]  the crew that I'm talking about. If we see each other and just nod at each other, because
[04:19.520 --> 04:24.480]  we've seen each other so many times, you're part of the crew I'm talking about. You guys
[04:24.480 --> 04:29.340]  make these events happen, and we kind of rely on you. I've noticed that I find myself hovering
[04:29.340 --> 04:33.420]  and lingering at those booths that you're there all the time, because we've become comfortable,
[04:33.420 --> 04:37.340]  we've become friends, and you guys are also leaders, and you're teaching the other booths
[04:37.340 --> 04:41.940]  and the other vendors how to do it. So big shout out, much respect to the family that
[04:41.940 --> 04:46.940]  travels around and does all of the events and supports each other, supports the movement.
[04:46.940 --> 04:50.380]  It's really great to see you guys every time you show up. You're welcome in Colorado all
[04:50.380 --> 04:53.980]  the time. If you ever need anything when you're in Colorado, let me know, and I will do my
[04:53.980 --> 04:58.380]  best to accommodate you fully. Much love and respect to the whole cannabis community and
[04:58.460 --> 05:02.780]  industry. And also big shout out to all the people that come and learn and meet me and
[05:02.780 --> 05:07.340]  greet me and shake my hand and high five me and ask me questions and thank me for my breeding.
[05:08.060 --> 05:11.740]  Big shout out to all those people. I really enjoy going to those events. It's really a
[05:11.740 --> 05:16.700]  refreshing time. All right, so you guys, let's get down to business. Here is the topic for
[05:16.700 --> 05:21.980]  the show today. I've been bumping into people and they've been talking about why some people
[05:21.980 --> 05:26.620]  are able to take their cannabis to the next level, and some people are stuck growing.
[05:26.860 --> 05:32.220]  Um, it's not mid-grade, but it's still not stellar cannabis. So I thought that I would
[05:32.220 --> 05:37.340]  write down some of the reasons why your herb, not yours, but some herb is not what we would
[05:37.340 --> 05:41.980]  consider top shelf product. And then we could talk about a few ways on how to improve that
[05:41.980 --> 05:47.580]  and get your herb up to the top shelf. So let me work on my list here. I got a couple of things
[05:47.580 --> 05:52.140]  written down. All right, you guys, the main reason I find that cannabis is not able to be
[05:52.140 --> 05:57.260]  considered top shelf product is because it has been over fertilized. A lot of people are thinking
[05:57.260 --> 06:01.500]  that they can add more fertilizer and feed it more, and you're going to get better product.
[06:01.500 --> 06:06.460]  But actually what you're doing is you are pumping it full of nutrients that are going to affect the
[06:06.460 --> 06:10.220]  flavor. It's going to be harder to flush that stuff out in the end. Everything that you put
[06:10.220 --> 06:16.060]  into your plants will affect the flavor. Another big reason that I find a lot of cannabis is not
[06:16.060 --> 06:21.660]  able to be considered top shelf product is that it was not properly flushed. You guys, your cannabis
[06:21.660 --> 06:28.140]  plants need to be flushed for a minimum of 10 days, preferably two full weeks before harvest.
[06:28.140 --> 06:33.260]  So 10 to 14 days before you plan on cutting down your plants, you need to start watering it
[06:33.260 --> 06:39.980]  with just clean water, pH at about 6.5. Get in there and just fill every pot, fill the whole
[06:39.980 --> 06:44.700]  pot with water so that it's dripping out of the drain holes a little bit. Do that 14 days before
[06:44.700 --> 06:48.460]  harvest and then let it dry up just like it normally would. And when you're going to water
[06:48.460 --> 06:52.380]  again, make sure you water it until it drips out of the pot a little bit. And you don't want to
[06:52.380 --> 06:57.420]  give it any nutrients for the last 14 days. If you're an experienced grower, there are a few
[06:57.420 --> 07:01.820]  things you can add at the end there, but I wouldn't recommend too many things unless you really know
[07:01.820 --> 07:06.700]  what you're doing. This is where you're really going to start affecting your flavor. So be
[07:06.700 --> 07:12.780]  careful at the end, make sure you flush for at least 14 days. You can go longer. I don't think
[07:12.780 --> 07:16.940]  you can over flush. If you feel like you start flushing about 14 days before you think you're
[07:16.940 --> 07:21.020]  going to harvest and you feel like those plants can go a few more days, don't worry. Let them go
[07:21.020 --> 07:25.100]  a few more days. They'll be just fine and they will taste even better. Let them finish up, let
[07:25.100 --> 07:29.420]  them ripen up, let them flush out, let all the nutrients come out and you'll be okay. Now you
[07:29.420 --> 07:34.060]  guys, you may see some yellowing. Hope for some yellowing. That means you're flushing it properly.
[07:34.060 --> 07:38.700]  That means that you're getting all the excess nutrients out of the leaves that are stored in
[07:38.700 --> 07:42.780]  the plants and you're going to flush that right on out. That means that there aren't extra nutrients
[07:42.780 --> 07:46.780]  left in the soil that the plant's eating. It means it's eaten all of its food and it's getting
[07:46.780 --> 07:53.100]  cleaned up and it's almost time for harvest. Now I want to take a step back and say over fertilization
[07:53.100 --> 07:59.420]  and not flushing are both possible. Even when you are using organics, you guys, organic nutrients
[07:59.420 --> 08:05.260]  can still burn your plants. Organic nutrients can over fertilize your plants. Be careful when using
[08:05.260 --> 08:09.820]  organics. You can add the wrong, I mean think about the way that stuff smells. When you're working
[08:09.820 --> 08:15.020]  with some organics, it literally smells like a pile of shit. If you over fertilize it, they can
[08:15.020 --> 08:21.340]  make your buds taste like a pile of shit. It is very possible. Also not flushing. I hear a lot of
[08:21.340 --> 08:26.540]  people say they don't have to flush because they used organic nutrients. You need to flush.
[08:26.540 --> 08:31.180]  If you're using your own like super soil and you know that you don't need to flush
[08:31.180 --> 08:34.460]  because you've been flushing the whole time, you're an experienced grower and you understand that,
[08:34.460 --> 08:40.060]  but if you're using a bottled nutrient or some sort of organics or most amended soils, you're
[08:40.060 --> 08:44.140]  going to need to flush you guys. So make sure you flush even with organics. Make sure you don't
[08:44.140 --> 08:49.980]  over fertilize even with organics and this can make your cannabis better. If you're using a
[08:49.980 --> 08:55.100]  bottled nutrient, start with about half of what they recommend on the bottle, about half of the
[08:55.100 --> 09:00.380]  dosage rate. And then if you see that you have a deficiency, move up. You can correct, you can
[09:00.380 --> 09:05.580]  always add, but you can never subtract from what you fed your plants. All right, so don't over
[09:05.580 --> 09:12.620]  fertilize and do flush. The next thing that I see that makes cannabis not able to be top shelf
[09:13.340 --> 09:20.380]  is a really poor trim job. You would not believe how much very well grown cannabis I've seen
[09:20.380 --> 09:25.420]  that would have been top shelf if the grower would have taken just a little bit more time to make
[09:25.420 --> 09:29.500]  sure to take all those little tiny leaves off because we don't want to see any leaves when
[09:29.500 --> 09:35.100]  we're looking at the buds. We want to see trichomes, we want to see resin, we want to see just buds. We
[09:35.100 --> 09:38.860]  don't even want to see any stick at all. Just the little tiny stick that sticks out of the bottom of
[09:38.860 --> 09:44.140]  the bud, that's all that we need. So when you're trimming, make sure you take off all those little
[09:44.140 --> 09:48.620]  tiny pointy leaves, get in there and clean that shit up. Cut all the little sticks out, cut your
[09:48.620 --> 09:54.620]  sticks off of the big gigantic buds and trim your weed to look like just buds. Look at a magazine,
[09:54.620 --> 09:59.260]  look online, look what good quality bud looks like and trim it up like that. If you can see an
[09:59.260 --> 10:02.860]  obvious leaf on there, get in there with your scissors and clip it off. Get in there with your
[10:02.860 --> 10:08.540]  thumbnail and knock that off. Trim your weed like connoisseur grade weed and it will be top shelf.
[10:09.100 --> 10:13.260]  All right, and also wear rubber gloves you guys. When you're trimming your cannabis, make sure that
[10:13.260 --> 10:18.700]  you wear rubber gloves and in my opinion, top shelf herb is hand trimmed and not machine trimmed. If
[10:18.700 --> 10:24.060]  you've got machine trimmed bud that won a cannabis cup, I'm impressed. Let's see, wear rubber gloves
[10:24.060 --> 10:27.020]  you guys. Whenever you're touching these buds, whenever you're touching a product that somebody's
[10:27.020 --> 10:31.580]  going to smoke, make sure you wear rubber gloves. We do not want to smoke your skin oils. I don't
[10:31.580 --> 10:37.180]  want to hear your skin oil or your skin moisture sizzle in my dab. That's just so gross. So trim
[10:37.180 --> 10:42.540]  your weed, wear gloves and use scissors, not a trim machine is something I want to stress.
[10:43.260 --> 10:51.500]  All right, so another thing that quite often deters people's cannabis from being top shelf product
[10:51.500 --> 10:58.460]  is a very poor cure. A lot of people are trying to speed dry their cannabis. You guys, the slower
[10:58.460 --> 11:04.060]  your buds dry, the better they are going to taste, the better they are going to smoke.
[11:04.060 --> 11:11.180]  Think about your goal. Your goal is to eventually grind up this bud and either roll a joint out of
[11:11.180 --> 11:17.340]  it or pack a bowl or stuff it in your vaporizer. Or most of us nowadays are going to stuff it into
[11:17.340 --> 11:22.540]  a tube and turn it into BHO or a lot of you are going to freeze it and turn it into ice wax or
[11:22.540 --> 11:27.020]  something. But anyway, let's think about what we're trying to do. Eventually, most of us are
[11:27.020 --> 11:31.980]  going to grind up this herb and roll a fat joint out of it. Now when you smoke your joint, you want
[11:31.980 --> 11:37.820]  it to smell good, you want it to taste good, you want it to get you nice and stoned. But something
[11:37.820 --> 11:42.620]  that you really want it to do that you don't think about is that you want it to burn nice and smoothly.
[11:42.620 --> 11:48.140]  You want it to burn evenly. You want it to burn and make a nice white ash. You don't want it to burn
[11:48.140 --> 11:53.260]  into this hard black charcoal looking thing. That hard black charcoal that's in the bottom of your
[11:53.260 --> 11:57.420]  bowl when you're done or that your joint turns into, that's nutrients that weren't flushed out
[11:57.420 --> 12:04.860]  of the plant. Anyway, I'm backing up a little bit. But a lot of times a bad cure will make your buds
[12:04.860 --> 12:11.500]  not burn properly. When you're curing your buds, you are removing excess chlorophyll from the plants.
[12:11.500 --> 12:17.980]  You are removing a water molecule from the THC which makes the THC more psychoactive. You are
[12:17.980 --> 12:24.300]  also pulling chlorophyll which is making the plants taste better, making your buds taste better. So a
[12:24.300 --> 12:31.500]  proper cure and not a speed dry is very important. A proper cure will definitely affect the way that
[12:31.500 --> 12:38.140]  your buds burn. Slowly drying your buds will suck out all of that chlorophyll and it will suck the
[12:38.140 --> 12:45.100]  moisture out slowly and your buds will burn very nice and smoothly. They'll be nice and sticky and
[12:45.100 --> 12:51.100]  they will burn very, very well. I've got an episode all about drying and curing. I'm going to pause
[12:51.100 --> 12:55.820]  right now and go see exactly which number it is. It's either 35 or 36. Let me pause for one second
[12:55.820 --> 12:59.660]  and go see what it is so that I can tell you to listen. Here we go. Okay, you guys, it's episode
[12:59.660 --> 13:04.860]  number 35. Go listen to episode number 35 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast and learn all about
[13:04.860 --> 13:12.300]  properly drying and curing your cannabis. Actually, when it was episode 35, it was called I Grow Culture,
[13:12.300 --> 13:16.540]  but it's still on the same feed, you guys. It's episode number 35 and it's titled number 35,
[13:16.540 --> 13:21.500]  Drying and Curing. Go check it out. It's the formerly known as I Grow Culture podcast,
[13:21.500 --> 13:25.900]  the now known as the Grow From Your Heart podcast. It's in the same feed. Go check it out. I feel
[13:25.900 --> 13:32.540]  like I'm way off topic. Let's get back in the game here. We are talking about a poor cure is what
[13:32.540 --> 13:38.860]  makes your buds not top shelf because they don't taste good and they do not burn properly. You guys,
[13:38.860 --> 13:44.460]  it is very possible to have nice sticky buds that are properly dried and cured that will burn like
[13:44.460 --> 13:49.180]  a champ, stink up the whole fucking neighborhood and get you high as shit. That's your goal.
[13:49.180 --> 13:54.220]  So listen to the episode, learn how to properly dry and cure the buds. Another thing, don't try
[13:54.220 --> 13:58.940]  to speed dry your weed, you guys. Do not speed dry it. Cut it down, hang it upside down and let it
[13:58.940 --> 14:05.580]  dry properly. That's what that's going to give you a huge advantage. Also, here is a major
[14:05.580 --> 14:12.140]  contributing factor to why I feel like a lot of people's buds are not top shelf. You guys, people
[14:12.140 --> 14:20.060]  really love to cut their buds way too early. Let that shit grow. Let it finish. Just because the
[14:20.060 --> 14:25.740]  packaging on your seed package says that those seeds will be done in 60 days does not mean that
[14:25.740 --> 14:31.500]  you have to cut them down in 60 days. Get yourself a nice scope. Get some sort of a scope where you
[14:31.500 --> 14:36.860]  can magnify the size of your trichomes to where you can see how many of them have turned opaque,
[14:36.860 --> 14:41.500]  how many of them have gone cloudy, and how many of them are amber. When you start seeing about
[14:41.500 --> 14:47.580]  30% amber trichomes is when it's time to harvest, you guys. A lot of people are just cutting weed
[14:47.580 --> 14:53.420]  down way too early. They're trimming it like shit. They're speed drying it. And then they're trying to
[14:53.420 --> 14:58.300]  get top shelf prices for it. And they feel bad and they feel let down when they're not able to sell
[14:58.300 --> 15:04.220]  their product for a top shelf price. You've got to let it finish. You've really got to let it finish.
[15:04.220 --> 15:07.980]  It doesn't even taste right. It doesn't get you high enough. And you're not even getting the right
[15:07.980 --> 15:12.140]  weight if you don't let it finish. That last week or two is really where it starts packing on weight
[15:12.140 --> 15:18.220]  on a lot of strains. So let the weed grow longer. Quit cutting it too early and it will really
[15:18.220 --> 15:24.140]  improve the quality of your buds. Like I said, get a scope. Start watching the trichomes. Quit paying
[15:24.140 --> 15:28.620]  so much attention to your calendar and pay a little bit more attention to the plants. I understand
[15:28.620 --> 15:34.940]  you're on a schedule, but the plants are the boss here. And if you want A plus top shelf buds, this
[15:34.940 --> 15:40.780]  is what you're going to have to do. All right, so don't cut too early. Now also, you're going to have
[15:40.780 --> 15:45.900]  to pay a lot more attention to the room. We can tell, I can tell by looking at the finished product
[15:45.900 --> 15:51.660]  if the room got too hot or if the room got too humid or if you had some sort of bug infestation
[15:51.660 --> 15:55.900]  or if there was some sort of struggle. A professional grower can tell by looking at your
[15:55.900 --> 16:02.060]  finished buds what the problem was. If your buds are airy and fluffy, you probably got too hot in
[16:02.060 --> 16:07.420]  there. If the buds have this weird texture to them, it probably got too humid in there. I can spot
[16:07.420 --> 16:12.220]  bug damage on those leaves that you're not cutting off. I can see the spider mite marks on those
[16:12.220 --> 16:18.060]  leaves, you guys. So pay a lot of attention to the room. Get good control of your rooms. It's all about
[16:18.060 --> 16:23.740]  the environment. You have to set up that room to have proper airflow. You need air exchange. You
[16:23.740 --> 16:28.700]  need to get the old stale air out of there and you need to get fresh air in so that that plant can
[16:28.700 --> 16:33.500]  breathe. You don't want to be trapped in a stale, humid-ass closet all day. Neither do your plants.
[16:34.620 --> 16:39.980]  So, and they also don't want to be too hot. If you get the plants too hot, they start foxtailing, the
[16:39.980 --> 16:45.500]  buds start getting wispy. It's just like in the summertime, you guys. You guys, you know what I'm
[16:45.500 --> 16:49.660]  talking about. When it gets all hot, your junk starts swinging down all low. It's just trying to cool
[16:49.660 --> 16:54.300]  itself down. The plants will do the same thing. It starts spreading its legs all far so that it can
[16:54.300 --> 16:59.660]  get some air and it starts foxtailing. That's from too much heat, you guys. So if you get your
[16:59.660 --> 17:04.860]  grow room under control, you will be able to produce better cannabis. Get the bugs under
[17:04.860 --> 17:08.460]  control, you guys. If you don't have bugs on your plants, your plants don't have to spend all of
[17:08.460 --> 17:12.940]  their energy fighting off these predators and they're able to use all of their energy into
[17:12.940 --> 17:20.620]  producing delicious, tasty trichomes and resin and terpenes. Let the plants focus on what they're
[17:20.620 --> 17:28.460]  supposed to do. All right. So pay attention to the room. Get the room under control is the point
[17:28.460 --> 17:34.700]  of that part right there. So another reason why a lot of cannabis that I see cannot be considered
[17:34.700 --> 17:43.420]  top shelf cannabis is because the grower basically forgot the general rules of growing. He forgot to
[17:43.420 --> 17:48.780]  think about his lights, his air, his water, or his soil. He just kind of got off. Sometimes as
[17:48.780 --> 17:54.060]  growers, we get complacent. We get cocky. We get egotistical. We get overconfident. We get ahead
[17:54.060 --> 17:59.980]  of ourselves. That shit happens. And sometimes that's when you start worrying about something
[18:00.700 --> 18:05.340]  that is really obscure and then you forget about something that was really basic. You're trying
[18:05.340 --> 18:08.780]  some new trick that's really going to improve the crop, right? This new trick is going to make
[18:08.780 --> 18:14.460]  everything fucking magical. It's going to be amazing. But as I did that, I forgot to pH the
[18:14.460 --> 18:18.940]  nutrient solution before I watered it. Something stupid like that, you guys. Just pay attention to
[18:18.940 --> 18:24.140]  the basics. Pay attention to your lights. Pay attention to the air. Pay attention to your water
[18:24.140 --> 18:27.900]  and pay attention to your soil and everything should be cool. Of course, pay attention to the
[18:27.900 --> 18:33.500]  plants. Look at the leaves every day for bugs. Do all that stuff. But remember the basics. You need
[18:33.500 --> 18:39.500]  good lighting. If you don't have good lighting, you can't grow quality buds. You can grow quality
[18:39.500 --> 18:44.220]  bud under a small lamp. I wouldn't go, you know, you can use a 250. You're not going to grow
[18:44.220 --> 18:49.900]  cannabis cup winning buds underneath a 250 watt light. You may do okay under a four. You've got
[18:49.900 --> 18:55.100]  potential under a six. But I really think if you're going to grow cannabis cup winning top shelf A
[18:55.100 --> 19:00.300]  grade buds, you need at least a thousand watt light. At least 1000 watt light. And you don't
[19:00.300 --> 19:06.060]  want to try to put more than about a four by four or a five by five floor pattern worth of plants
[19:06.060 --> 19:10.460]  underneath there. You want your canopy to be nice and tight under that thousand watt light.
[19:10.460 --> 19:15.580]  The light is the main nutrient for your plants. That's what the plants want more than anything.
[19:15.580 --> 19:20.860]  So have enough lighting and also make sure you have the right spectrum. That's super important.
[19:20.860 --> 19:27.020]  Don't forget about that air. We sort of discussed air before. Don't have too much humidity. Don't
[19:27.020 --> 19:32.700]  have too much heat. Try to find a way to replenish the CO2 by replacing the air in the room very
[19:32.780 --> 19:38.780]  often. Your water. I've mentioned this. Make sure you're pH and your nutrient solution before you're
[19:38.780 --> 19:43.900]  feeding it to your plants. Make sure you're checking your PPMs. Make sure you're using good
[19:43.900 --> 19:49.020]  quality water. If you can start with reverse osmosis water, that would be ideal. Make sure
[19:49.020 --> 19:54.780]  you remember to check the pH you guys. A lot of people simply have overlooked pH balancing their
[19:54.780 --> 19:59.420]  water before they add it to the salute to the plants. You want that about six five ish depending
[19:59.420 --> 20:04.140]  on what strains you're running. Depends on how far into flower you are. But make sure you've got
[20:04.140 --> 20:07.980]  your nutrients measured properly. You're not overfeeding the plants and you've got them pH
[20:07.980 --> 20:13.260]  adjusted. Your soil you guys. You got to use a good quality soil. You can't be packing your dirt too
[20:13.260 --> 20:18.940]  tight. You need some aeration. You need some air in there. You need some drainage in there. Use good
[20:18.940 --> 20:23.980]  soil. Don't overlook that type of stuff. Those are the basics that you guys need to pay attention to
[20:23.980 --> 20:29.420]  that you may have forgotten. That sometimes I forget. I'm guilty of this as well. This is all
[20:29.420 --> 20:34.700]  small things that I'm trying to remind you about. So don't forget the basics of growing. And we can
[20:34.700 --> 20:40.940]  always refer to the old rule called laws. Lights, air, water, and soil. Never forget those. And then
[20:40.940 --> 20:44.460]  of course you got to add love in there. Because I think plants grow with a lot of love. You gotta
[20:44.460 --> 20:49.980]  love the plants. So another way to improve your cannabis. And this is going to sound like I'm just
[20:49.980 --> 20:56.060]  trying to make a sales pitch here. But you need good quality genetics you guys. Unless you've got
[20:56.060 --> 21:02.220]  a top shelf cultivar. And I'm gonna I'm gonna branch here. You guys quit saying strands. It's
[21:02.220 --> 21:06.780]  not a strand. We don't smoke different strands. We don't grow different strands. We grow different
[21:06.780 --> 21:12.380]  strains. And if you really want to be difficult and technical they're known as varietals. And then
[21:12.380 --> 21:19.180]  if you really want to be an asshole you would call it a cultivar. So a specific phenotype of a specific
[21:19.180 --> 21:25.340]  strain would be a cultivar. But I digress. Use good genetics you guys. Grow a good strain. If
[21:25.340 --> 21:30.140]  you're stuck on growing that strain and you can't get it to be what you want it to be. Maybe it's
[21:30.140 --> 21:35.740]  time to buy a pack of seeds and run those seeds and find the one in there that does what you need.
[21:35.740 --> 21:40.780]  Maybe you're simply held back by the quality of the clones you've got. That could be your issue. So
[21:40.780 --> 21:46.540]  use good genetics. Do some research. Get some seeds from a reputable breeder. I am not sponsored by
[21:46.540 --> 21:51.980]  thedankteam.com currently. They do not pay for any ads. But I can fully recommend my friends at
[21:51.980 --> 21:58.300]  thedankteam.com. They have reliable seeds. I used to say it all the time. You can get rare dankness,
[21:58.300 --> 22:04.780]  mile high, canaventure, sin city, sour seeds. Those are just a few of the people that I would recommend.
[22:04.780 --> 22:09.420]  Of course I read genetics if you can get your hands on it. Get yourself some good quality seeds
[22:09.420 --> 22:16.540]  from a reputable breeder. Do a pheno hunt. Find the best one out of there for you and maybe that
[22:16.540 --> 22:21.180]  will help you improve the quality of your cannabis. Maybe it's just that clone that you're growing
[22:21.180 --> 22:26.780]  isn't going to get any better. Maybe it's got, maybe its potential is only 17% THC no matter
[22:26.780 --> 22:31.660]  what you do to it. It's just a genetic thing. My genetics say that I'm not going to be able to jump
[22:31.660 --> 22:36.860]  six feet high no matter what I do. I can't jump high. I'm a white man that can't jump. It's just
[22:36.860 --> 22:42.540]  my genetics. Sometimes these plants aren't going to go much further than their potential. So get
[22:42.540 --> 22:48.140]  good genetics. Hey guys, we talked about lights air water and soil but what we got to think about
[22:48.140 --> 22:54.860]  is do not overlook the vegetative stage of growth. From day one when you get those clones, when you
[22:54.860 --> 23:01.740]  crack those seeds, from the very beginning of the grow you are working on the quality of that
[23:01.740 --> 23:06.620]  cannabis. You may just say, hey it's veg. I can just put it under these weak lights. I don't need
[23:06.620 --> 23:14.140]  a lot of good air. I don't need to feed it good nutrients. But really good teenagers and good kids
[23:14.140 --> 23:18.860]  make good adults. So why doesn't the same shit work with plants? I think you need to take really
[23:18.860 --> 23:23.740]  good care of those baby plants because that is the beginning of everything. You need to create a nice
[23:23.740 --> 23:29.340]  root zone. You need to create a nice thick stalk. You need a nice node structure. You need nice
[23:29.420 --> 23:37.820]  strong supported branches. You need nice topping. You need a nice canopy. You need nice pruning.
[23:37.820 --> 23:43.020]  Just take very good care of the plants in the veg phase and you will be very prepared for happy
[23:43.020 --> 23:47.660]  healthy plants when you go into the flowering stage. So pay more attention to the veg phase.
[23:47.660 --> 23:52.860]  I think a lot of people overlook the vegetative stage of cannabis growing. So that's a way that
[23:52.860 --> 23:59.500]  you could definitely improve the quality of your cannabis. Alright guys, I've got one more thing
[23:59.500 --> 24:03.900]  that I really think would help improve the quality of your finished product. And it will also help
[24:03.900 --> 24:09.580]  improve the quality of your concentrates if you're a hash maker. Something you really need to do
[24:09.580 --> 24:15.820]  is clean your grow room. Make sure that the floor is clean. Make sure that the tops of your light
[24:15.820 --> 24:19.900]  reflectors are dusted off. Make sure that the air conditioner gets cleaned. Make sure that all the
[24:19.900 --> 24:25.020]  blowers and the carbon filters, the tops of them sometimes, they collect a little dust. Clean those.
[24:25.020 --> 24:29.580]  Make sure that your carbon filter covers get cleaned occasionally. Hey guys, you got to go in
[24:29.580 --> 24:35.660]  there and clean up. If you've got a shop vac with a good filter on it, get in there and shop vac the
[24:35.660 --> 24:40.620]  corners. Clean the fuck out of that grow room because every piece of dust and particulate that
[24:40.620 --> 24:46.140]  is in the air will end up sticking to your plants. If you've ever taken a picture of a cannabis plant
[24:46.140 --> 24:51.580]  and there's a little hair in there, you understand exactly how bad anything and everything will stick
[24:51.580 --> 24:55.180]  to your cannabis plants while they're growing. You'll never be able to get the hair out of it.
[24:55.180 --> 25:00.700]  You'll never be able to get the dust out. So clean up the grow room. If you've got long hair, if you've
[25:00.700 --> 25:05.340]  got a beard, think about keeping that shit out of the plants too. Do what you can. I can't talk too
[25:05.340 --> 25:10.060]  much shit. I've got dreadlocks that go almost to my knees. I've got to wear a big ass hat just to go
[25:10.060 --> 25:16.700]  in the grow room. So try to be sanitary, try to be clean, try to be dust free, try to clean up all
[25:16.700 --> 25:21.340]  that shit. All of that stuff is going to stick to your buds. All that stuff is going to end up in
[25:21.340 --> 25:25.500]  your finished product. All that stuff is going to end up in your concentrate. So just think about
[25:25.500 --> 25:29.900]  all the dust and whatever that is, it's soil and whatever else you're dragging around in the grow
[25:29.900 --> 25:35.980]  room. That's all going to end up in your finished product. All right, you guys. So I'm going to do a
[25:35.980 --> 25:40.940]  quick recap. I've gone through my list. Let's go real quickly. If you want your buds to be a little
[25:40.940 --> 25:47.180]  bit better than they are, maybe you could pay more attention to your feeding. Maybe you could flush a
[25:47.180 --> 25:52.060]  little bit better. You could possibly trim up your buds a little bit better. You could probably
[25:52.060 --> 25:56.060]  improve the quality of your drying and curing method, which all you'd have to do is listen to
[25:56.060 --> 26:01.180]  episode number 35. And that'll give you huge steps on how to do that. You could probably let your
[26:01.180 --> 26:04.940]  plants grow a little bit longer. Pay attention to the harvest date. That would help you out.
[26:05.500 --> 26:10.140]  You could probably pay more attention to the room and dial the room in a little bit better. You could
[26:10.140 --> 26:15.260]  probably work on not having bugs. Another good way to improve the quality of your cannabis is to
[26:15.260 --> 26:21.020]  remember the basics. Remember the fundamentals of growing. Another huge way to improve the quality
[26:21.020 --> 26:28.220]  of your grow is to use quality genetics from a reputable breeder. Another good way is to not
[26:28.220 --> 26:34.220]  overlook your veg phase. And of course, clean up the grow room. And then of course, we've got a
[26:34.220 --> 26:39.100]  little side note here that says good lighting. So make sure you're using proper lighting. And also
[26:39.100 --> 26:42.940]  you guys, good nutrients, good quality nutrients will get you a long way. Make sure your plants
[26:42.940 --> 26:49.020]  are properly fed. There are a few things that I think would work with every feed regimen. If you
[26:49.020 --> 26:55.740]  wanted to add dehydrated coconut water and also yucca extract, those things will definitely improve
[26:55.740 --> 27:00.540]  your cannabis with almost any feed regimen. If you're going hydro, you're going to have to figure
[27:00.540 --> 27:04.540]  out how to add those to your hydro regimen. It's a little bit different. But if you got a soil mix
[27:04.540 --> 27:08.860]  going on, those things will definitely make your plants taste better. If your plants are burning
[27:08.860 --> 27:13.420]  and making black ashes, you're probably over-nutrienting, over-nutrienting, over-feeding,
[27:13.420 --> 27:17.900]  over-fertilizing is what I think I'm trying to say. And you're not flushing properly. So work on
[27:17.900 --> 27:22.620]  those things. You guys, that's all I've got for this episode. I'm going to start wrapping up the
[27:22.620 --> 27:27.740]  show. I will be back in about, I'm not going to do a midweek episode. So I will be back Monday for
[27:27.820 --> 27:31.900]  you. I've got a couple of few things planned. I'm trying to link up with our friend Fox. He's in
[27:31.900 --> 27:36.860]  Colorado right now. He is a busy man. He is elusive. I've chased him down for a day and it was hard to
[27:36.860 --> 27:43.340]  find him. So I did not record with him yet, but we will in the future if everything goes my way.
[27:44.140 --> 27:47.900]  Uh, you guys, I'd love it if you found me on the social media. I am on Twitter. It's
[27:47.900 --> 27:54.060]  at GFYH podcast. We are on Facebook. It's grow from your heart. On Instagram, I use the I read
[27:54.060 --> 27:59.260]  genetics Instagram page. We're almost at 19,000 followers. It'd be really cool if you clicked on
[27:59.260 --> 28:04.620]  that and put me up there at 19,000 followers. That'd be really cool. So follow I read genetics
[28:04.620 --> 28:09.500]  on Instagram. You guys, I think that's all I've got for you this week. I want to thank everybody
[28:09.500 --> 28:15.420]  for listening. I want to give a big shout out to my ninja Spence until next time you guys take a
[28:15.420 --> 28:18.060]  fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[28:53.920 --> 28:58.160]  I blame I say, bring the right straight to my brain.
[29:11.920 --> 29:13.360]  Start up. No reprise.
[29:23.360 --> 29:24.160]  No.
[29:40.560 --> 29:42.160]  Just so let it be.
[29:45.040 --> 29:47.200]  This is not marijuana music.
[29:47.920 --> 29:50.000]  Some message from the ones that use it.
[29:51.440 --> 29:55.040]  As a mind that fertile bring forth something that worthwhile.
[30:03.680 --> 30:04.240]  Thoughts of
[30:17.920 --> 30:19.440]  don't want you to know.
[30:25.200 --> 30:26.800]  Just so let it be.
[30:33.520 --> 30:37.920]  I so can be free. Just so let it be.
[30:41.760 --> 30:43.120]  The truth is to be told.
[30:43.680 --> 30:44.480]  Open your eyes.
[30:51.920 --> 30:52.800]  What is the flow?
[30:54.720 --> 30:55.600]  Who is the king?
[30:57.520 --> 30:58.320]  You know, it's him.
[31:00.160 --> 31:01.200]  Is it freestyle?
[31:01.200 --> 31:04.160]  If I can see that the line, then configure the timing.
[31:04.160 --> 31:05.680]  I just to pick the right scheme.
[31:07.440 --> 31:07.920]  Really?
[31:13.680 --> 31:15.360]  Don't want you to know.
[31:21.040 --> 31:22.640]  Just so let it be.
[31:32.160 --> 31:33.760]  Just so let it be.
[31:35.520 --> 31:36.320]  Is there no?
[31:40.560 --> 31:41.200]  I so.
[31:43.440 --> 31:44.960]  Just so let it be.
[31:46.880 --> 31:48.800]  They don't want you to know.
[31:51.760 --> 31:53.600]  I so can be free.
[31:54.560 --> 31:56.160]  Just so let it be.
[32:00.160 --> 32:01.040]  And I let them know.
[32:02.240 --> 32:03.680]  That the herb is a lifeline.
[32:04.480 --> 32:06.320]  Now, they would never want you to know.
[32:07.440 --> 32:09.040]  They would never want you to know.
[32:10.000 --> 32:10.800]  So be free.
[32:13.360 --> 32:14.800]  Never wanted to know.
[32:14.800 --> 32:16.160]  I'm crazy.
[32:16.160 --> 32:17.760]  Never wanted to know.
[32:17.760 --> 32:18.960]  No, no, no, no, no.
[32:18.960 --> 32:20.560]  Never wanted to know.
