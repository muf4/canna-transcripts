[00:00.510 --> 00:25.720]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:25.720 --> 00:32.520]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 694 of the Grow From Your
[00:32.520 --> 00:34.160]  Heart Podcast.
[00:34.160 --> 00:38.220]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about breeding with feminized seeds.
[00:38.220 --> 00:41.840]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:41.840 --> 00:45.940]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.

[01:11.820 --> 01:14.660]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to my buddy Graybeard.
[01:14.700 --> 01:18.780]  Let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to
[01:18.780 --> 01:21.100]  a friend with weed.
[01:21.100 --> 01:26.260]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:26.260 --> 01:29.980]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:29.980 --> 01:36.580]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:36.580 --> 01:40.100]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen and you know I do include
[01:40.100 --> 01:45.140]  a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all
[01:45.140 --> 01:46.700]  of my friends.
[01:46.700 --> 01:51.020]  This episode will come out right after Thanksgiving, Indigenous Peoples Day, Black Friday.
[01:51.020 --> 01:53.220]  It will actually come out on Cyber Monday.
[01:53.220 --> 01:54.820]  I hope everybody had a great holiday.
[01:54.820 --> 01:55.820]  I hope you had a good feast.
[01:55.820 --> 01:58.260]  I hope you had a good walk with your cousin.
[01:58.260 --> 02:02.980]  I also want to tell everybody big thanks for all of the support on the Black Friday sales.
[02:02.980 --> 02:03.980]  That's right.
[02:03.980 --> 02:07.060]  We put out a couple of new strains and if you were looking for those new strains on
[02:07.060 --> 02:11.420]  Black Friday and you had a problem finding them, that is because they sold out almost
[02:11.420 --> 02:12.420]  instantly.
[02:12.420 --> 02:13.420]  That's right.
[02:13.420 --> 02:15.140]  They dropped at 420 on most of the vendors.
[02:15.140 --> 02:18.180]  By 430, most of them were sold out.
[02:18.180 --> 02:22.340]  A lot of people were sending me messages asking where and how to get those new drops.
[02:22.340 --> 02:23.340]  I do apologize.
[02:23.340 --> 02:24.680]  They went quite quickly.
[02:24.680 --> 02:28.180]  They are being restocked by the time this episode comes out.
[02:28.180 --> 02:32.100]  Most of the vendors should be replenished with the new drops of Saka Souffle and The
[02:32.100 --> 02:33.100]  Machine.
[02:33.100 --> 02:34.100]  Check the website.
[02:34.100 --> 02:35.140]  Check the vendor links.
[02:35.140 --> 02:38.460]  You should be able to find those new packs in stock somewhere.
[02:38.460 --> 02:42.540]  If you were looking for The Machine and Saka Souffle on Black Friday and you were unable
[02:42.540 --> 02:44.220]  to get those, I do apologize.
[02:44.220 --> 02:46.820]  However, they should be back in stock now.
[02:46.820 --> 02:48.580]  Once again, check that vendor list.
[02:48.580 --> 02:49.580]  Check the websites.
[02:49.580 --> 02:52.860]  You should be able to find Saka Souffle and The Machine.
[02:52.860 --> 02:53.860]  All right.
[02:53.860 --> 02:57.780]  I do have one more thing to cover before we get to the main topic of this podcast.
[02:57.780 --> 03:01.860]  The show is approaching 10,000 YouTube subscribers.
[03:01.860 --> 03:07.700]  My goal for this podcast for the end of the year is to reach 10,000 YouTube subscribers.
[03:07.700 --> 03:12.980]  Also, all I want for Christmas is 10,000 YouTube subscribers.
[03:12.980 --> 03:18.060]  If you are listening on an audio platform, I do invite you to come subscribe to the YouTube
[03:18.060 --> 03:19.060]  channel.
[03:19.060 --> 03:21.020]  Come check out the cool 4K video editing I'm doing.
[03:21.020 --> 03:22.460]  I've got two cameras going.
[03:22.460 --> 03:23.460]  They're both 4K.
[03:23.460 --> 03:24.780]  I think it looks pretty good.
[03:24.780 --> 03:26.300]  See my cool background, my lighting.
[03:26.300 --> 03:28.140]  Check out my fancy table set up here.
[03:28.140 --> 03:31.820]  Anyway, I do invite you to come subscribe to the YouTube channel.
[03:32.780 --> 03:34.980]  If you're watching and you haven't subscribed already, now is the time.
[03:34.980 --> 03:37.380]  Please click that little red subscribe button.
[03:37.380 --> 03:38.940]  Click on the notification bell.
[03:38.940 --> 03:42.500]  That way, every time I put out a new episode, you'll get a notification and you'll never
[03:42.500 --> 03:45.740]  miss an episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:45.740 --> 03:46.740]  All right.
[03:46.740 --> 03:49.820]  Let's jump into the main topic of this episode.
[03:49.820 --> 03:52.760]  This question came from the iRegenetics website.
[03:52.760 --> 03:55.900]  If you've got a grow question, you can visit the iRegenetics website.
[03:55.900 --> 03:57.800]  There is a grow help tab.
[03:57.800 --> 03:58.800]  Simply click on that tab.
[03:58.800 --> 04:01.580]  It will ask you a few preliminary questions.
[04:02.340 --> 04:07.500]  If you're asking a plant-specific question or a problem-specific question, those preliminary
[04:07.500 --> 04:10.620]  questions will help me kind of diagnose your problem.
[04:10.620 --> 04:11.620]  Give me some details.
[04:11.620 --> 04:13.260]  Let me know what's going on in the grow.
[04:13.260 --> 04:16.980]  Then at the bottom, it does give you the opportunity to type out in detail what's going on and
[04:16.980 --> 04:18.380]  ask your question.
[04:18.380 --> 04:20.780]  This was not a plant-specific question.
[04:20.780 --> 04:24.220]  This is a breeding question that came from our friend, Laser King.
[04:24.220 --> 04:25.900]  It goes a lot like this.
[04:25.900 --> 04:32.180]  It says, Rasta Jeff, when you have feminized seeds and you make feminized F2, will you
[04:32.180 --> 04:36.620]  have the same genetic diversity as in regular F2 seeds?
[04:36.620 --> 04:38.140]  That is a very good question.
[04:38.140 --> 04:42.700]  There are a couple of things to unpack to get to the answer to that one.
[04:42.700 --> 04:45.440]  Our friend is asking about feminized seeds.
[04:45.440 --> 04:50.180]  If you don't understand fem seeds, I've done several episodes on feminized seeds.
[04:50.180 --> 04:51.500]  There's a full podcast about it.
[04:51.500 --> 04:56.700]  If you type in Grow From Your Heart Podcast, feminized seeds, it will come up.
[04:56.700 --> 05:01.380]  That is a good basis for feminized seeds, a good base education.
[05:01.380 --> 05:07.940]  Our friend apparently has feminized seeds or is thinking about breeding with fem seeds.
[05:07.940 --> 05:12.860]  When you make a batch of seeds, that first batch, we're going to call it, for the sake
[05:12.860 --> 05:15.680]  of this question here, we're going to call it an F1.
[05:15.680 --> 05:20.540]  When you take two strains that are non-similar parents and you cross them, you have now made
[05:20.580 --> 05:22.060]  an F1.
[05:22.060 --> 05:26.460]  You probably made a polyhybrid, but that's just details to talk about in the future.
[05:26.460 --> 05:29.340]  We're going to say for this question, you've made an F1.
[05:29.340 --> 05:35.140]  You've taken a plant and reversed it and used that pollen to put onto a different plant.
[05:35.140 --> 05:39.100]  Now we have made an F1 that is feminized.
[05:39.100 --> 05:41.380]  That may also be called an S1.
[05:41.380 --> 05:43.900]  It could also be called an R1.
[05:43.900 --> 05:46.020]  We're going to talk about that.
[05:46.220 --> 05:50.580]  Those labels, and people are going to, those are kind of made up labels by the cannabis
[05:50.580 --> 05:51.580]  industry.
[05:51.580 --> 05:54.820]  We are kind of bastardizing all of these labels for the cannabis industry.
[05:54.820 --> 05:59.220]  I think S and R were kind of made up by the industry to indicate.
[05:59.220 --> 06:03.100]  Let's talk about what an S and an R are because that will help us out.
[06:03.100 --> 06:08.340]  When we are reversing plants, when I'm making feminized seeds, we are reversing a plant.
[06:08.340 --> 06:13.300]  I'm taking a female plant and treating it with a solution to cause that plant to create
[06:13.300 --> 06:15.380]  pollen, which will all be female pollen.
[06:15.380 --> 06:19.900]  Then we put that pollen on another female plant.
[06:19.900 --> 06:25.260]  Now if I take, let's just say golden goat, golden goat is a really good place to start.
[06:25.260 --> 06:30.660]  If I take a golden goat female plant and reverse it and make pollen out of that golden goat,
[06:30.660 --> 06:36.060]  I can either put that pollen on another golden goat female, or I can put that pollen on any
[06:36.060 --> 06:38.660]  other female in my grow.
[06:38.660 --> 06:44.340]  If I put that feminized pollen from golden goat onto golden goat, I have done what is
[06:44.340 --> 06:45.900]  called selfing.
[06:45.900 --> 06:48.340]  That plant has selfed itself.
[06:48.340 --> 06:50.740]  This may be crass, but you will never forget it.
[06:50.740 --> 06:53.860]  That plant just fucked itself and made babies.
[06:53.860 --> 06:55.420]  You're never going to forget that.
[06:55.420 --> 06:57.940]  It is a little crass, but it is in your brain forever.
[06:57.940 --> 07:00.740]  It is S, self, selfed itself.
[07:00.740 --> 07:05.740]  That is golden goat to golden goat, nothing but golden goat, S1 in that genetics.
[07:05.740 --> 07:08.080]  You're not going to find anything but golden goat.
[07:08.080 --> 07:12.520]  You may find some recessive traits from the golden goat parents and grandparents, but
[07:12.520 --> 07:13.720]  there's no adulteration.
[07:13.720 --> 07:16.500]  It's just golden goat genetics in that line.
[07:16.500 --> 07:21.840]  If I were to take that golden goat pollen and put it on any other plant, that is going
[07:21.840 --> 07:26.680]  to be labeled an R plant, a R. R is for reversal.
[07:26.680 --> 07:29.240]  The number that follows that will be your generation.
[07:29.240 --> 07:33.600]  It can be an R1, an R2, but in this case, we're just going to say R1.
[07:33.600 --> 07:37.980]  The first time I make that pollen and put it on a different plant, the seeds that come
[07:37.980 --> 07:40.720]  out of that are now labeled an R1.
[07:40.720 --> 07:42.360]  It's a reversal one.
[07:42.360 --> 07:49.740]  It is an F1, but to be friendly and to give more information, a breeder would be polite
[07:49.740 --> 07:55.700]  if they label that as an S1 or an R1, which would indicate that it is feminized and it
[07:55.700 --> 07:59.120]  would let you know a little bit of how it has been created and worked.
[07:59.120 --> 08:04.340]  That is why we use more specific labels other than F1, S1, R1.
[08:04.340 --> 08:06.380]  I think I've talked about the difference.
[08:06.380 --> 08:08.460]  If it were a regular seed, it would be an F1.
[08:08.460 --> 08:10.820]  If it was not feminized, it'd be an F1.
[08:10.820 --> 08:15.220]  Since we're working with fems, we get S1s and R1s.
[08:15.220 --> 08:17.800]  Let me catch myself back up on my notes.
[08:17.800 --> 08:22.940]  The original question is, are we going to have the same genetic diversity as in regular
[08:22.940 --> 08:24.540]  F2 seeds?
[08:24.540 --> 08:28.420]  That genetic diversity will be dictated by a couple of things.
[08:28.420 --> 08:33.300]  First of all, was the original plant a selfed plant or a reversed plant?
[08:33.740 --> 08:39.500]  The second question is, are you putting that pollen on the same plant or a different plant?
[08:39.500 --> 08:44.380]  The reason I'm asking that is because that is going to unlock different potential.
[08:44.380 --> 08:47.100]  There are more ingredients going into the pie.
[08:47.100 --> 08:48.200]  Think about it this way.
[08:48.200 --> 08:53.580]  If I've got golden goat and I'm only putting golden goat to golden goat, 100% golden goat,
[08:53.580 --> 09:00.700]  I'm going to get probably 75% to 80% of my phenotypes are going to be very golden goat.
[09:00.700 --> 09:04.860]  Some of those other phenotypes, the other 25, 20-ish percent are going to look like
[09:04.860 --> 09:10.620]  the parents that created golden goat and possibly the grandparents that created those plants.
[09:10.620 --> 09:14.380]  That's a little bit unlikely, but it is possible when you're working with genetics.
[09:14.380 --> 09:17.500]  You do see the history when you're making things.
[09:17.500 --> 09:21.220]  We're not going to see any other genetics other than the ingredients that were in that
[09:21.220 --> 09:25.300]  pie that made golden goat, but it's going to be very golden goat dominant.
[09:25.300 --> 09:30.280]  Let's talk about if I took a golden goat and pollinated, let's just say, lemon skunk and
[09:30.280 --> 09:31.920]  made lemon Jeffrey.
[09:31.920 --> 09:37.200]  Now you've got the opportunity to see the parents of the golden goat and also the parents
[09:37.200 --> 09:39.600]  of the lemon Jeffrey in that cross.
[09:39.600 --> 09:44.400]  We've got two different ingredients, so we've got more options for more flavors.
[09:44.400 --> 09:50.880]  Most of the time we're going to see a beautiful 50-50 mix of golden goat and lemon skunk,
[09:50.880 --> 09:55.840]  which is a beautiful phenotype of the lemon Jeffrey, but you're going to see leaners toward
[09:55.840 --> 09:59.700]  the golden goat and you're going to see leaners toward the lemon Jeffrey.
[09:59.700 --> 10:05.540]  Now this is going to depend on which plant is more dominant in the genetics, which traits
[10:05.540 --> 10:06.540]  take over.
[10:06.540 --> 10:10.500]  There'll be recessive traits, there'll be dominant traits, there'll be co-dominant traits,
[10:10.500 --> 10:13.860]  which traits in your plants win in that mix.
[10:13.860 --> 10:17.040]  It's like you just put all these ingredients in a bowl and you shook them up.
[10:17.040 --> 10:18.340]  Which one's got more flavor?
[10:18.340 --> 10:20.020]  Which one's going to win in that mix?
[10:20.020 --> 10:21.020]  Which flavor?
[10:21.020 --> 10:23.460]  And there are so many other things to think about when it comes to breeding.
[10:23.460 --> 10:24.780]  It's not just flavor.
[10:24.780 --> 10:29.500]  The flavor, the aromas, the buzz, and the appearance are all things we can quickly identify, but
[10:29.500 --> 10:31.580]  we've also got to think about how does it grow?
[10:31.580 --> 10:32.700]  Is it resistant?
[10:32.700 --> 10:36.980]  Is there a resistance to pests and pathogens and problems and stress?
[10:36.980 --> 10:40.900]  Those are very important things to think about, but I'm kind of getting off topic here.
[10:40.900 --> 10:43.900]  The main thing we're going to see is the parents.
[10:43.900 --> 10:48.020]  You're going to see the golden goat and the lemon skunk, and then you may see a little
[10:48.020 --> 10:49.700]  bit of the golden goat parents.
[10:49.700 --> 10:52.780]  There's Romulan, Island Sweet Skunk, Hawaiian Sativa in there.
[10:52.780 --> 10:55.300]  You may see some of those traits pop up.
[10:55.300 --> 10:59.380]  In the lemon skunk, there's some sort of skunk and some sort of lemon.
[11:00.260 --> 11:04.260]  I don't even know exactly what made the lemon skunk, but you're going to see traits of those
[11:04.260 --> 11:05.260]  parents.
[11:05.260 --> 11:09.700]  Honestly, a lot of the things, if I reverse golden goat, I see I can identify the golden
[11:09.700 --> 11:13.420]  goat traits in it, and then I can identify the traits that come from the other plants
[11:13.420 --> 11:14.420]  very well.
[11:14.420 --> 11:19.580]  The lemon jeffery, that spacious between the nodes, that spacious growth between the nodes,
[11:19.580 --> 11:21.620]  that directly comes from the lemon skunk.
[11:21.620 --> 11:26.020]  That crazy wicked potency, that comes directly from the golden goat.
[11:26.060 --> 11:30.820]  It depends on the dominance of the traits in which plant you're going to use.
[11:30.820 --> 11:34.820]  Now, let me get myself back on track and focus a little bit, because the question is specifically
[11:34.820 --> 11:42.500]  about S2 or F2 with feminized seeds, and will we see the same genetic diversity as within
[11:42.500 --> 11:43.740]  an F2?
[11:43.740 --> 11:46.100]  In my experience, no.
[11:46.100 --> 11:52.540]  When you make F2s of regular seeds, the F2 is when you find the wild diversity, the wild
[11:52.540 --> 11:53.940]  variation.
[11:53.940 --> 11:58.220]  I think it is called transgressive segregation or recessive segregation.
[11:58.220 --> 11:59.980]  One of those words is accurate.
[11:59.980 --> 12:03.140]  Somebody tell me, because I just pulled that out of the sky randomly, and there are a lot
[12:03.140 --> 12:04.300]  of words in my brain.
[12:04.300 --> 12:07.660]  One of those is accurate, but it's the segregation word.
[12:07.660 --> 12:12.220]  When we find offspring that outperform the original parents, that's when you see stuff
[12:12.220 --> 12:14.020]  like that.
[12:14.020 --> 12:17.700]  The F2s will show wild variation.
[12:17.700 --> 12:20.660]  You see a lot of things that look like the mom, a lot of things that look like the dad,
[12:20.660 --> 12:22.540]  a lot of things that are 50-50.
[12:22.580 --> 12:25.620]  We see a lot of crazy grandparent traits get brought out.
[12:25.620 --> 12:29.660]  If you're looking to find some of the older stuff in the line, you can find that in the
[12:29.660 --> 12:30.660]  F2s.
[12:30.660 --> 12:34.100]  That's where it will represent itself or present itself.
[12:34.100 --> 12:37.460]  Then you find the F3 and breed those together and wash all that old stuff out and start
[12:37.460 --> 12:38.780]  narrowing it down.
[12:38.780 --> 12:40.540]  That's the process for there.
[12:40.540 --> 12:44.000]  With the feminized seed, you don't really bring out all that old stuff.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.800]  You are locking it in even tighter.
[12:46.960 --> 12:52.600]  Something I have noticed when you do make the feminized S2s, sometimes you can make
[12:52.600 --> 12:56.640]  kind of weaker spindly plants that don't perform as well.
[12:56.640 --> 13:00.880]  Sometimes you really lock in super traits that have very uniform plants.
[13:00.880 --> 13:07.200]  That S2 will come out almost like an F4 and F5 with the uniformity if you've done proper
[13:07.200 --> 13:08.200]  selection.
[13:08.200 --> 13:13.080]  Again, a lot of this will be based very much on the plants which you select, the dominance
[13:13.080 --> 13:14.920]  of the genes which you're using.
[13:15.040 --> 13:21.240]  Since you're using feminized seeds and doing that, the S1s and only and not doing R's,
[13:21.240 --> 13:24.280]  you've got the good opportunity of locking in the traits that you really want.
[13:24.280 --> 13:26.640]  It's all about phenotypical selection.
[13:26.640 --> 13:31.320]  Something I have noticed is that different phenotypes of the same strain will react differently
[13:31.320 --> 13:32.920]  when they are feminized.
[13:32.920 --> 13:37.920]  I had a plant, and we'll just say number nine and number four were both reversed and self
[13:37.920 --> 13:39.300]  to each other.
[13:39.300 --> 13:40.640]  Number nine was awesome.
[13:40.640 --> 13:41.760]  Number four was trash.
[13:41.760 --> 13:44.120]  All the seeds that came out of there showed me garbage.
[13:44.320 --> 13:46.320]  I did not like what they represented.
[13:46.320 --> 13:49.000]  Number nine was awesome.
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.400]  My favorite plant that came out of the S1s of number nine, I made S2s of those and that
[13:55.400 --> 13:59.320]  got labeled, if I start talking numbers, I'll reveal what it is because it's known as number
[13:59.320 --> 14:01.000]  77.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.800]  Number 77 had problems being reversed.
[14:03.800 --> 14:07.440]  It was so dominant and so female that I could not reverse it.
[14:07.440 --> 14:12.520]  I had to really spray the shit out of it, start spraying it early to get it to reverse.
[14:12.520 --> 14:17.120]  The original question is, will I see the same genetic diversity in the F2s?
[14:17.120 --> 14:20.800]  No, they're going to be, in my opinion, they'll be much more locked down.
[14:20.800 --> 14:25.840]  You're not going to get ... I was rambling about how the F2s in regular seeds bring up
[14:25.840 --> 14:27.840]  that wild genetic diversity.
[14:27.840 --> 14:31.120]  The feminized F2s kind of lock it in really tight.
[14:31.120 --> 14:33.380]  You're not going to see much diversity at all.
[14:33.380 --> 14:38.960]  It's going to be more like an F3 or an F4 of regular seeds, and it's going to be very,
[14:38.960 --> 14:42.560]  very uniform if you have selected the correct phenotype.
[14:42.560 --> 14:44.800]  Like I said, number nine was amazing.
[14:44.800 --> 14:49.000]  Number four did not want to be F2ed in any way.
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.160]  Now I kind of hinted at this a moment ago, but think of breeding a little bit as chefing.
[14:54.160 --> 14:57.280]  Every ingredient you put in is going to add to the mix.
[14:57.280 --> 14:59.960]  Now think about portions of those ingredients.
[14:59.960 --> 15:05.300]  If I add one portion of one thing, my meal tastes, or my mix, my final product tastes
[15:05.300 --> 15:06.800]  like that one thing.
[15:06.800 --> 15:09.480]  If I put in golden goat, it tastes like golden goat.
[15:09.480 --> 15:11.000]  It is only golden goat.
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.480]  If I put in some lemon skunk, now probably I'm going to get 50% lemon skunk, 50% golden
[15:17.480 --> 15:18.940]  goat when we shake it up.
[15:18.940 --> 15:22.600]  You got to think about there's going to be the edges of the pan or the edges of the cookie
[15:22.600 --> 15:23.920]  sheet or however.
[15:23.920 --> 15:25.720]  That's where your outliers are going to be.
[15:25.720 --> 15:27.920]  Right in the middle is going to be your regular shit.
[15:27.920 --> 15:29.240]  Then outliers are going to be out there.
[15:29.240 --> 15:33.440]  You're going to find some weirdos out there, but most of your flavors are going to be 50-50.
[15:34.240 --> 15:39.120]  Let's think about if we're breeding feminized plants to itself again, you just added more
[15:39.120 --> 15:40.800]  golden goat to the mix.
[15:40.800 --> 15:44.800]  You're just doubling up on the golden goat flavor, making it super golden goat.
[15:44.800 --> 15:49.320]  Now that one is going to have that one batch of pie or that one cake is double golden goat.
[15:49.320 --> 15:53.440]  Now whatever you breed to that, it's going to be two golden goats to whatever you breed
[15:53.440 --> 15:56.040]  it to technically just because of the breeding that you've done.
[15:56.040 --> 15:58.400]  You've locked in that golden goat trait so hard.
[15:58.400 --> 16:01.720]  Kind of think about it as if we filled the pan with golden goat.
[16:01.720 --> 16:06.200]  We're only going to take golden goat, but if we filled a pan with 50% golden goat and
[16:06.200 --> 16:10.200]  50% lemon skunk and blend it together, now right in the middle there is going to be a
[16:10.200 --> 16:15.420]  beautiful blend of 50% lemon skunk, 50-50 lemon skunk and golden goat.
[16:15.420 --> 16:17.960]  Maybe on the outer edges, maybe we didn't blend it too well.
[16:17.960 --> 16:21.040]  You're going to get some that's a little more golden goat, some that's a little more lemon
[16:21.040 --> 16:23.720]  skunk and the opposite on other parts.
[16:23.720 --> 16:27.720]  That's kind of how breeding works if you want to be real basic about it and compare it to
[16:27.720 --> 16:28.720]  chefing.
[16:28.840 --> 16:32.960]  I know I took off on a good ramble on that one, but the short answer is you will not
[16:32.960 --> 16:38.320]  see as much diversity in the feminized F2 as you would in the regular F2 because you're
[16:38.320 --> 16:41.200]  not unlocking that Pandora's box.
[16:41.200 --> 16:47.600]  In my experience and in my opinion, the phenotypes do come out much more uniform, much more regular
[16:47.600 --> 16:52.400]  and quite a bit like that original plant that you started with.
[16:52.400 --> 16:58.080]  Sometimes though you can create weak and spindly offspring in the feminized F2, but a lot of
[16:58.080 --> 17:05.840]  the times you do make very stable, uniform, viable crosses when doing the feminized F2.
[17:05.840 --> 17:10.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers,
[17:10.240 --> 17:14.480]  growers, clone cutters and pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
[17:14.480 --> 17:17.960]  out there, I want to thank you once again for listening to another episode of the Grow
[17:17.960 --> 17:19.640]  From Your Heart podcast.
[17:19.640 --> 17:21.920]  This may be a quick episode after some editing.
[17:21.920 --> 17:24.280]  I do want to make sure to get this episode completed.
[17:24.280 --> 17:27.480]  I've been experiencing some camera technical difficulties.
[17:27.480 --> 17:31.240]  I want to get this episode done, get these cameras checked out, see what's going on.
[17:31.240 --> 17:34.120]  I do promise longer, better episodes in the future.
[17:34.120 --> 17:36.560]  I do have two more breeding questions here lined up.
[17:36.560 --> 17:39.080]  We will get to those in the next episode.
[17:39.080 --> 17:42.040]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments or concerns, you know that I would love to
