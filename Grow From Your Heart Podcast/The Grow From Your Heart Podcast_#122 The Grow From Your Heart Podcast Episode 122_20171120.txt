[01:06.600 --> 01:09.880]  I heard the kid ate potatoes today. He did first potatoes.

[01:13.560 --> 01:16.640]  Big shout out to the wife for taking some time and letting you come hang out.
[01:17.080 --> 01:19.800]  Yup. That's much appreciated. Thanks for taking a little man, baby.

[01:22.480 --> 01:24.320]  but thanks to Mike's wife for letting Mike come play.
[01:24.320 --> 01:26.360]  I appreciate you letting me borrow your husband for a little while.
[01:26.400 --> 01:29.040]  It's really cool. I appreciate it. All right, well,
[01:29.160 --> 01:31.160]  we'll quit talking about babies and we'll get on with the podcast.
[01:31.160 --> 01:34.480]  You guys, thanks for jumping in. Thanks for joining the podcast. Uh,
[01:34.520 --> 01:35.880]  let's see where we want to start.
[01:35.880 --> 01:39.200]  I want to give a big shout out to my friend, John Anthony Moses.
[01:39.440 --> 01:42.560]  I know you're hanging out, listening to the podcast. Thanks for listening,
[01:42.560 --> 01:44.080]  Brian. I appreciate it. Uh,
[01:44.720 --> 01:48.200]  also let's get into the big topic that's been going on here in Pueblo,
[01:48.200 --> 01:53.120]  Colorado. Uh, the cannabis cup was supposed to be in Denver on four 20.
[01:53.280 --> 01:54.880]  Supposed to supposed to,
[01:54.920 --> 01:57.880]  but unfortunately the city of Denver declined all of the permits.
[01:57.880 --> 02:00.880]  I'm not sure exactly. Uh, Denver officials declined all the permits.
[02:00.880 --> 02:02.400]  They were not allowed to host the event there.
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.320]  I believe. Well, either way they said, Nope, not going to do it. Nope.
[02:07.360 --> 02:11.200]  They had some issues, namely out of state dispensaries,
[02:11.200 --> 02:16.200]  handing out samples and what was supposed to be 14,000 people a day,
[02:16.240 --> 02:20.120]  actually being 35,000 people a day. All right. Well, anyway, they said, No,
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.680]  not going to happen. I've been following this one close.
[02:23.720 --> 02:26.600]  High times came down to Pueblo, Colorado where Mike and I reside.
[02:27.640 --> 02:32.560]  They claimed they were going to do the festival on the 18th, 19th, uh, 20th,
[02:32.600 --> 02:36.480]  21st, within that range. That was the original goal. They put up a flyers.
[02:36.480 --> 02:38.160]  They put out some announcements on their website.
[02:38.160 --> 02:40.800]  They put out some stuff on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
[02:41.240 --> 02:44.880]  And then suddenly they retracted all of their statements and said, Oh shit,
[02:44.880 --> 02:49.360]  the next weekend. Uh, so the permits have been entered. Uh,
[02:49.400 --> 02:51.880]  they've been submitted. They're being reviewed so far.
[02:51.880 --> 02:55.960]  The city of Pueblo has not said if they are going to allow or decline the
[02:55.960 --> 02:58.160]  cannabis cup to happen in Pueblo, Colorado,
[02:58.320 --> 03:00.360]  this episode will come out in two or three days.
[03:00.600 --> 03:03.560]  And I'm pretty sure the decision will not be made at that time. So right now,
[03:04.240 --> 03:08.200]  uh, there is no definite location for the high times cannabis cup in Colorado.
[03:08.200 --> 03:09.680]  And it, uh, if it does happen,
[03:09.680 --> 03:13.080]  it will be moved to the weekend of the 22nd and the 23rd.
[03:13.960 --> 03:16.600]  If it does happen in Pueblo, Colorado at all.
[03:17.240 --> 03:21.360]  Yeah. I read something today claiming that this move was,
[03:21.400 --> 03:25.000]  it was sort of an option B if, um,
[03:25.040 --> 03:29.360]  Adams County didn't go through and they'd been looking for bigger locations than
[03:29.360 --> 03:31.640]  the Denver Mart and, uh, the,
[03:31.640 --> 03:36.080]  the location down here in Pueblo claims to be able to handle the 25 or 30,000
[03:36.080 --> 03:37.600]  people a day. No problem. So
[03:37.880 --> 03:40.640]  I'm not too familiar with the location. I thought Denver Mart was great.
[03:40.680 --> 03:42.760]  But of course, when I heard that it was going to be in Pueblo,
[03:43.040 --> 03:43.960]  I was excited.
[03:43.960 --> 03:46.360]  That's so awesome. That shaves a lot, a,
[03:46.400 --> 03:50.640]  a huge chunk of money out of going to the cup for people that just want to go to
[03:50.640 --> 03:53.520]  the cup. Yeah. You got to go up, you got to get a hotel room.
[03:53.520 --> 03:55.880]  You don't want to be driving back home to Pueblo after the cup.
[03:56.720 --> 04:00.600]  Um, and it's a multiple day event and I have to go to every day just because
[04:00.600 --> 04:03.840]  that's how I, if you're trying to go to all three days or have to go to all
[04:03.840 --> 04:06.520]  three days, you gotta be up there for, you know,
[04:06.520 --> 04:09.480]  paying top dollar for hotel rooms right now in Denver sucks.
[04:09.680 --> 04:12.120]  And every, all of the shitty hotels go expensive.
[04:12.120 --> 04:14.280]  If you think you're going to pay 70 or 80 for a hotel,
[04:14.560 --> 04:18.720]  those 70 and $80 hotels are now 130 on cannabis cup weekend. Yep.
[04:19.360 --> 04:23.120]  Every hotel in Denver knows that four 20 is a big weekend in Denver and they
[04:23.120 --> 04:25.400]  cash the fuck in. Unfortunately,
[04:25.400 --> 04:28.400]  a bunch of people have already booked plane tickets. They've booked rooms.
[04:29.400 --> 04:33.280]  The big complaint about the cup in Denver was always that the planning was sort
[04:33.280 --> 04:38.160]  of like a D minus, like the roof didn't fall in. Like nobody got squash.
[04:38.200 --> 04:40.360]  But other than that, it was kind of a clusterfuck.
[04:40.560 --> 04:40.720]  Well,
[04:40.720 --> 04:43.400]  when they changed their mind that they weren't going to do it in Denver and they
[04:43.400 --> 04:46.600]  decided to move it to Pueblo, a lot of people were like, yeah, fuck Pueblo.
[04:46.880 --> 04:50.160]  Yeah. Pueblo has got an interesting reputation out there. Yeah, we sure do.
[04:50.200 --> 04:53.840]  We sure do. But then when they pushed the date to a completely different weekend,
[04:54.120 --> 04:57.160]  I'm sure that a large portion of the people that were going to attend just
[04:57.160 --> 04:58.920]  decided, fuck it. They weren't even going to try.
[04:59.560 --> 05:03.280]  If the cup goes off in Pueblo, because it's not at all a sure thing at this
[05:03.280 --> 05:04.440]  point, folks, it's,
[05:04.800 --> 05:08.160]  the decision comes down to the County planning department.
[05:08.880 --> 05:13.040]  And then if they decide, yes, it can be appealed, um,
[05:13.040 --> 05:17.800]  by any number of people in our local sheriff has told the press that if it's
[05:17.800 --> 05:21.440]  approved, he's going to appeal, um, because he doesn't,
[05:21.840 --> 05:26.320]  he doesn't have any idea how he's going to handle 35,000 cannabis cup attendees,
[05:26.880 --> 05:28.520]  not because of the number of attendees,
[05:28.520 --> 05:30.240]  but because they're attending the cannabis cup.
[05:30.280 --> 05:31.920]  Something about the event makes it special.
[05:32.040 --> 05:33.720]  We're going to be too high to drive.
[05:33.800 --> 05:36.400]  We're going to be too high to drive is what I saw in a statement.
[05:36.920 --> 05:38.920]  They're really scared of dabs.
[05:40.040 --> 05:42.200]  I mean, yeah, to, to the average,
[05:42.200 --> 05:45.600]  to a normal person who's never seen cannabis and sees me pull out a torch and
[05:45.600 --> 05:49.200]  heat up a nail and do this crack like looking drug. I can understand the fear,
[05:49.200 --> 05:50.920]  but he's a police officer. He's a sheriff.
[05:51.200 --> 05:54.320]  He needs to figure out what's going on with the medical marijuana community and
[05:54.360 --> 05:57.680]  be in touch with us and come join us instead of be afraid of us and try to
[05:57.680 --> 05:59.160]  persecute us and prosecute us.
[05:59.160 --> 05:59.480]  Right.
[05:59.480 --> 06:03.600]  Spend 10 minutes talking to any member of the community and we will cease to be
[06:03.600 --> 06:04.440]  scary.
[06:04.600 --> 06:06.760]  Truth. I'm a peaceful dude. I may look intimidating.
[06:06.760 --> 06:09.760]  I may say a lot of big, crazy, weird words, but when it comes down to it,
[06:09.760 --> 06:10.880]  I'm a peaceful chilled out dude.
[06:10.880 --> 06:13.880]  And I'd love to sit down and have a conversation with anybody who needs to be
[06:13.880 --> 06:16.360]  educated properly about cannabis. That's what the show's all about.
[06:16.480 --> 06:18.560]  Cannabis edumacation. That's what today is.
[06:18.640 --> 06:22.320]  There was, there was a lot of hilarity, I think in this story. Um,
[06:22.320 --> 06:26.280]  if you look at some of the reasons stated and quoted that, uh,
[06:26.280 --> 06:28.480]  the permits went up in Denver were denied.
[06:29.000 --> 06:33.160]  The two big reasons that are cited over and over and over again in the press are
[06:33.760 --> 06:35.440]  a woman jumped out of her car,
[06:37.040 --> 06:40.720]  like somewhere in and around the cannabis cop or she had just attended or was on
[06:40.720 --> 06:42.160]  her way. It doesn't really specify,
[06:42.680 --> 06:46.080]  but like clearly marijuana use doesn't cause jumping out of cars.
[06:46.080 --> 06:49.520]  No, I've smoked. People. If you know me,
[06:49.600 --> 06:52.000]  like Colorado sold almost a billion dollars with a weed last year.
[06:52.520 --> 06:55.720]  Cause to jumping out of cars. We would know.
[06:56.120 --> 06:57.960]  How many people have the medical marijuana car?
[06:58.320 --> 07:01.360]  There'd be that many people jumping out of cars. I smoke. I would,
[07:01.400 --> 07:06.400]  I would have a good bet and saying I smoke more cannabis than 90% of the people
[07:06.640 --> 07:07.080]  on the planet.
[07:07.080 --> 07:11.120]  Right? Like that's not an effect we wouldn't see for years down the road.
[07:12.160 --> 07:13.680]  If cannabis made you jump out of cars,
[07:13.680 --> 07:15.600]  I would have done backflips out of buses by now.
[07:15.720 --> 07:18.200]  Right. And there were 35,000 people a day at the cup.
[07:18.240 --> 07:19.760]  And one woman jumped out of a car.
[07:20.120 --> 07:22.160]  That's not exactly like event related.
[07:22.240 --> 07:26.200]  They forgot to mention in the article that she took a dab and then she went and
[07:26.200 --> 07:29.280]  did a whole bunch of Molly and that she drank whiskey. And then
[07:29.480 --> 07:33.160]  I've only ever heard of a chick jumping out of a car one of the time and she was
[07:33.160 --> 07:35.880]  stone sober and fighting with her boyfriend. So like,
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.360]  there's a lot of not, not, were you the boyfriend? Nope. I was not,
[07:41.360 --> 07:44.320]  I was friends with the boyfriend and they showed up. It's a long story.
[07:44.320 --> 07:47.200]  I'm not fucking telling it now. Let's not go there. But uh, yeah,
[07:47.200 --> 07:49.800]  like that wasn't drug or alcohol related. That was,
[07:49.800 --> 07:52.760]  I can't be in this car another minute fucking craziness longer.
[07:52.960 --> 07:55.800]  So if you do come to Colorado and you come to Pueblo,
[07:55.840 --> 07:58.600]  if we do have the cannabis cup here, please behave yourself,
[07:58.600 --> 08:02.280]  represent yourself as a positive cannabis user and a responsible cannabis user.
[08:02.960 --> 08:05.760]  Uh, be careful. They're going to be looking for people driving too high.
[08:06.080 --> 08:07.480]  Check it out. Let's talk about this a little bit.
[08:07.480 --> 08:10.800]  I don't know the exact rule here, but they treat cannabis like alcohol.
[08:10.800 --> 08:12.560]  If you're going to be leaving the cannabis cup,
[08:12.800 --> 08:14.920]  have your cannabis in a sealed container.
[08:14.920 --> 08:18.760]  If you can put it in the trunk of your car, put your rig, your dabber,
[08:18.960 --> 08:22.160]  your carb cap, your torch, and especially your product,
[08:22.200 --> 08:25.840]  any product you've got that's smokeable, edible, drinkable. Uh,
[08:25.840 --> 08:29.040]  if it's cannabis infused related, if you can rub it on your balls,
[08:29.360 --> 08:31.320]  put it in the trunk of the car. If you don't have a trunk,
[08:31.320 --> 08:34.480]  if you've got an SUV, put it in the backpack, zip the backpack up,
[08:34.480 --> 08:38.560]  put it way in the back of the vehicle, have it out of reach of the driver. Uh,
[08:38.600 --> 08:43.000]  don't get yourself a DUI or an illegal possession of cannabis ticket because
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.800]  that is still a possible thing here in Colorado.
[08:48.360 --> 08:49.400]  This cannabis cup,
[08:49.400 --> 08:53.880]  if it goes off in Pueblo is going to be under a lot of scrutiny and
[08:53.880 --> 08:54.400]  honestly,
[08:54.400 --> 08:58.080]  Pueblo could use a cup down here and I'd really like to see the event do well.
[08:58.080 --> 09:00.320]  If it gets approved at all, I would love to see it.
[09:01.240 --> 09:04.840]  One of the big complaints in Adams County was out of state dispensaries coming
[09:04.840 --> 09:08.320]  here and selling weed and dabs at their booths. Um,
[09:08.360 --> 09:12.280]  some of them were doing donation, um,
[09:12.680 --> 09:15.640]  legal mumble jumbo. Other people were straight doing sales.
[09:17.280 --> 09:21.000]  At least according to recent reports. And yeah, that's a big no, no here,
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.240]  which is why none of our local dispensaries were even handing out product at
[09:24.240 --> 09:25.600]  the cup. Um,
[09:25.640 --> 09:29.480]  I get that the cup is supposed to be the community gathering and celebrating and
[09:29.480 --> 09:30.800]  having a huge smoke out,
[09:31.320 --> 09:35.560]  but how you hand out samples or what people bring to smoke.
[09:35.560 --> 09:37.080]  Like there's a lot of rules around that.
[09:37.080 --> 09:40.880]  You need to know the law and please try to comply with it.
[09:40.880 --> 09:42.400]  Like as much as practicable.
[09:42.560 --> 09:44.600]  Be careful, please, please don't fuck it up for us.
[09:44.600 --> 09:47.520]  We've worked really hard here to do this. We've got a good thing going. Uh,
[09:47.520 --> 09:49.280]  come have a good time. I'm not trying to be a dick about it.
[09:49.280 --> 09:52.520]  Come when you're at the event, take dabs, share your dabs with your friends.
[09:52.520 --> 09:56.040]  Give me a fat dad. Take a fat dad with me. High five me. Let's take some selfies.
[09:56.040 --> 09:58.480]  Let's get on Instagram together. Let's Snapchat at the fuck up,
[09:58.720 --> 10:01.640]  but be careful when you're driving away from there and keep your cannabis safe.
[10:01.640 --> 10:04.600]  Keep your eyes not red. Uh, be able to walk the line,
[10:04.840 --> 10:06.000]  be able to pass the tests.
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.040]  Remember we did the episode a little while back about interacting with law
[10:09.080 --> 10:12.320]  enforcement. Be prepared for that shit. If you're a nervous person,
[10:12.880 --> 10:15.640]  don't be extra high and nervous when you're leaving the cup,
[10:16.120 --> 10:17.880]  hang out for an extra hour. You know what I'm saying?
[10:17.880 --> 10:19.520]  If you take a couple of dabs, hang out for an hour.
[10:19.800 --> 10:21.880]  When I went back and listened to that episode,
[10:21.880 --> 10:26.640]  the one thing I realized I meant to emphasize and didn't was the easiest way to
[10:26.640 --> 10:29.680]  not get in trouble with law enforcement and to be calm and cool during those
[10:29.680 --> 10:32.680]  interactions is to not be breaking the law.
[10:33.120 --> 10:35.840]  You know, that's something my buddy Lewis shout out Magoo. He goes,
[10:35.840 --> 10:38.800]  you know what you forgot to fucking mention was don't have fucking expired
[10:38.800 --> 10:41.880]  plates. Don't have your tags expired. Don't have a broken headlight.
[10:41.920 --> 10:43.600]  Don't have a broken taillight. Don't be an asshole.
[10:43.600 --> 10:46.800]  Don't have a cracked windshield. He said, break one rule at a time.
[10:47.080 --> 10:49.160]  It was his advice. Shout out to Magoo for
[10:49.160 --> 10:51.960]  I grew up in a lawyer family. Like if you haven't figured out that,
[10:52.200 --> 10:54.240]  figured that out yet by now, I don't know if you've been listening,
[10:54.800 --> 10:58.600]  but uh, that's an old lawyer joke is like, if you've got to break the law,
[10:58.600 --> 11:01.400]  break one law at a time. And it's fucking true.
[11:01.720 --> 11:04.080]  Like if you've got weed in the car and you ain't allowed to have weed,
[11:04.080 --> 11:07.280]  make sure that that's the only rule you're breaking. If you're speeding,
[11:07.720 --> 11:10.840]  you're asking to get caught. If you're, you've got a fucked up car,
[11:10.840 --> 11:14.400]  you're asking to get caught. In a lot of States, if you look like Jeff,
[11:14.400 --> 11:16.760]  you're asking, Hey, Hey. And by what?
[11:16.960 --> 11:19.280]  So some of the listeners don't know some of the listeners,
[11:19.480 --> 11:21.040]  this gets pointed out to me occasionally.
[11:21.040 --> 11:24.560]  Some listeners don't know this when people meet me or they hear my voice
[11:24.560 --> 11:25.560]  somewhere and they turn around and like,
[11:25.600 --> 11:28.280]  is that you cause I go to the grocery store sometimes and people like, dude,
[11:28.280 --> 11:32.240]  that's fucking you. Uh, you guys, I am six foot five. Uh,
[11:32.240 --> 11:36.560]  and I've got dreadlocks almost to my knees. I am not even joking.
[11:36.560 --> 11:40.480]  My dreadlocks go damn near to my knees. Now I can close them in the car door.
[11:40.920 --> 11:42.400]  I used to roll them up in the car window,
[11:42.400 --> 11:46.440]  but now they're so long that that shit isn't even thought about. Uh, yeah,
[11:46.440 --> 11:49.480]  they're long to testify for me, Mike, these fucking things.
[11:49.480 --> 11:50.320]  They're ridiculous.
[11:51.400 --> 11:54.840]  With a gentle weave that could be like a legit hammock or blanket.
[11:54.960 --> 11:57.720]  This one here is bigger around than my torch.
[11:58.120 --> 12:01.680]  I've watched them steal things from other people's hands without Jeff's
[12:02.400 --> 12:04.560]  consent. Oh, my dreads will clean off a table.
[12:04.600 --> 12:06.920]  They work like a bullet from time to time. It's hilarious.
[12:07.560 --> 12:10.560]  If I need space at a concert, I just shake the dreadlocks around a little bit.
[12:10.560 --> 12:13.160]  And then no one wants my dreadlocks in their face and or their beer.
[12:13.160 --> 12:15.160]  So they just back the fuck up and give me some dancing room.
[12:15.560 --> 12:19.040]  In Colorado. It's not that unusual to see some dreadlocks.
[12:19.040 --> 12:23.800]  It's really unusual to see locks this long. Um, but uh, yeah,
[12:23.800 --> 12:27.000]  in other States you're a walking advertisement for a dude that's high. Yeah.
[12:27.040 --> 12:29.760]  Oh, you should see me try to go through the, uh, the TSA going through the
[12:29.760 --> 12:31.760]  airport. Right. They inspect my dreadlocks.
[12:31.760 --> 12:35.480]  They fucking want to squeeze them and see what's in there, honey. Yeah. So, uh,
[12:35.840 --> 12:38.240]  you guys, if you're coming to the cannabis cup, be careful. Uh,
[12:38.280 --> 12:41.160]  look out at the cup, have a good time. I will be there. Look for me.
[12:41.520 --> 12:44.600]  I'm going to do a shameless shout out here since the cannabis cup in Denver will
[12:44.600 --> 12:47.920]  not be on the week of, on the day of four 20, uh,
[12:47.920 --> 12:50.240]  everyone's looking for something to do on four 20 in Denver.
[12:50.240 --> 12:53.080]  I want to give a huge shout out to an event called the secret sesh.
[12:53.320 --> 12:55.840]  The secret sesh will be happening at the Gatsby gardens in Denver,
[12:55.840 --> 12:59.960]  Colorado on four 20. And I do invite you to join us for more information.
[12:59.960 --> 13:03.160]  You're going to have to follow the secret sesh Colorado on Instagram,
[13:03.160 --> 13:06.760]  search them out. Uh, we will get a website going. There's more happening.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.640]  Our homie Adam L will be coming out to DJ or not to DJ to host the show.
[13:10.640 --> 13:13.400]  I apologize. I'm not sure if I can announce who the DJ will be. I'm excited.
[13:13.400 --> 13:16.800]  I know who the DJ is. I think, I think we've got him lined up,
[13:16.800 --> 13:19.400]  but I don't want to say the name of the DJ on the show here and get everybody
[13:19.400 --> 13:22.160]  pumped up because it's a good DJ. You guys will recognize his name.
[13:22.160 --> 13:23.960]  When I say it, if you're a fan of the podcast,
[13:23.960 --> 13:26.800]  you might know who I'm talking about. Uh, and it is not nicotine.
[13:26.920 --> 13:28.840]  So I'm just going to cross that one off.
[13:28.840 --> 13:31.160]  A lot of people might think I have nicotine coming to DJ an event,
[13:31.400 --> 13:34.720]  but we do not. So big shout out to the Grammy Gatsby, a big shout out to,
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.480]  the secret sesh. We want to get the secret sesh packed up.
[13:37.480 --> 13:41.080]  We want you there to come check it out. All right. So, um,
[13:41.280 --> 13:42.800]  we do have a topic for this episode.
[13:42.800 --> 13:46.200]  It's not just going to be two high guys taking dabs and rambling. Um,
[13:46.240 --> 13:48.720]  we got the topic. Uh, our friend, uh,
[13:48.720 --> 13:52.360]  she calls herself that one mountain girl sent me a message on Instagram and she
[13:52.400 --> 13:52.720]  said, Hey,
[13:52.720 --> 13:56.400]  you guys should do a message about how to get your badge in Colorado.
[13:56.400 --> 13:59.600]  So big shout out to that one mountain girl for listening to the podcast.
[13:59.600 --> 14:02.720]  Also a big shout out for following me on IgE. Uh, man,
[14:02.720 --> 14:05.600]  today and today it happened to a lot of people,
[14:05.620 --> 14:09.480]  but I noticed several Instagram accounts got wiped the fuck out the green and
[14:09.480 --> 14:12.640]  healthy wellness Instagram account for the shop. Bye-bye.
[14:12.680 --> 14:15.720]  The Terpex account for their hash. Bye-bye.
[14:15.880 --> 14:18.560]  I'm afraid to open mine right now and look if it's even there, because I mean,
[14:18.560 --> 14:19.800]  that's my crew. You know what I mean?
[14:20.040 --> 14:20.600]  Right.
[14:20.600 --> 14:23.640]  Grow the herb for green and healthy and then it's blasted by Terpex and we're
[14:23.640 --> 14:28.280]  all tagged in the same posts. So I feel like my time's coming on Instagram.
[14:28.280 --> 14:31.200]  You guys, if it disappears, I'll just create a Rasta Jeff Instagram.
[14:31.200 --> 14:34.000]  It won't even be I read genetics anymore. It'll be Rasta Jeff this time.
[14:34.000 --> 14:35.800]  It'll be the second incident that is second.
[14:35.880 --> 14:38.080]  I read genetics Instagram to get blasted down.
[14:38.360 --> 14:40.960]  So I'll just make a Rasta Jeff if it disappears. I'll let you know.
[14:41.960 --> 14:45.040]  Instagram is good on you. Yeah. Yeah. I love Instagram. It's fun.
[14:45.040 --> 14:47.520]  I like to post pictures of what's going on and interact with my friends and my
[14:47.520 --> 14:51.240]  family out there. So big shout out to that one mountain girl. Also, uh,
[14:51.240 --> 14:52.880]  also shout out to my friend Jessica.
[14:52.880 --> 14:55.200]  She kind of encouraged me to write this episode.
[14:55.200 --> 14:59.520]  She is a manager at a very prominent dispensary in the Colorado Springs area.
[14:59.800 --> 15:02.240]  Big shout out to her and her staff and her dispensary.
[15:02.440 --> 15:04.200]  I'm not going to say the name of the dispensary. I'm sorry.
[15:04.520 --> 15:07.880]  I should've got a mini shout out. He got a shout out. Jess, big love, big hugs.
[15:08.240 --> 15:11.200]  Um, but, uh, Jess was like, you should do an episode.
[15:12.320 --> 15:15.160]  We had a friend doing this, going through the same thing. And I was,
[15:15.200 --> 15:17.320]  I thought about we should do a show for that. Right? Yeah.
[15:17.320 --> 15:19.800]  Well, Jessica deals with people at the dispensary every day.
[15:19.800 --> 15:23.440]  And one person today asks how do, yeah. And Mike works at a dispensary too.
[15:23.440 --> 15:26.920]  And Mike and Jess both have one person a day say, how do I get a badge?
[15:26.920 --> 15:28.720]  How do I get a badge? How do I get a badge?
[15:29.040 --> 15:32.360]  So now all they have to do is refer that person to this episode.
[15:32.360 --> 15:35.840]  Welcome new listener. If you learned about the podcast by somebody saying, Hey,
[15:35.840 --> 15:37.920]  listen to that, you'll learn how to get your badge. Welcome.
[15:37.920 --> 15:40.960]  Thanks for joining us. I'm Ross the Jeff across the table is my buddy, white Mike.
[15:41.560 --> 15:45.600]  We're going to teach you how to get your badge. I took a bunch of notes. Um,
[15:45.640 --> 15:48.000]  so I'm going to open the notes. I'm gonna find them. Here we go. Uh,
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.600]  it says how to get your badge in Colorado.
[15:49.600 --> 15:54.040]  And this is how to get a Colorado marijuana enforcement division badge so that
[15:54.040 --> 15:58.760]  you're able to work in a legal recreational and or medical marijuana facility.
[15:58.760 --> 16:02.640]  This could be a dispensary where you're either rolling joints all day where
[16:02.660 --> 16:04.920]  you're a bud tender. Uh, if you're going to be,
[16:04.960 --> 16:07.720]  there's a million different types of jobs, dispensaries,
[16:07.720 --> 16:11.880]  but be prepared to start at the bottom of the ladder. Kind of regardless. Yeah.
[16:11.880 --> 16:14.040]  Yeah. Like unless you're coming with 2 million bucks,
[16:14.040 --> 16:15.400]  but anything you're going to do in there,
[16:15.400 --> 16:19.640]  you need a badge from the owner to the bud tender to the joint roller to the
[16:19.640 --> 16:24.640]  dude who paints the walls to the, Oh, the lawyer needs a badge.
[16:24.680 --> 16:28.120]  The guys that come in and build the place have to get either real badges or
[16:28.120 --> 16:32.680]  visitor badges. So all the people that work for the dispensary,
[16:32.800 --> 16:36.720]  the grows, the processing facilities where extracts are made,
[16:36.740 --> 16:39.000]  the facilities where edibles and drinkables are made,
[16:39.000 --> 16:40.620]  the places where topicals are made,
[16:40.900 --> 16:44.380]  even the testing facilities where the cannabis is tested for cannabinoids.
[16:44.700 --> 16:48.580]  They all are required to have a Colorado marijuana enforcement division badge,
[16:48.600 --> 16:53.600]  which requires a thorough FBI background check fingerprints and an intensive,
[16:53.940 --> 16:55.740]  intensive application process.
[16:55.740 --> 16:59.700]  So if you don't meet the requirements, you're not going to get a badge.
[16:59.780 --> 17:01.220]  We'll get to that. We'll get to that.
[17:01.460 --> 17:04.180]  So let's talk about the steps on how to get this badge.
[17:04.300 --> 17:05.580]  Cause if you want to work at a dispensary,
[17:05.580 --> 17:07.620]  this is the first thing that you need to do.
[17:07.700 --> 17:09.020]  And this is really,
[17:09.020 --> 17:11.780]  really important if you're thinking about moving here to work in legal weed,
[17:12.180 --> 17:13.980]  know this before you move.
[17:14.020 --> 17:14.420]  Yes.
[17:14.420 --> 17:17.300]  There's one step in here that you'll need to know and we'll get to it.
[17:17.320 --> 17:18.620]  I'm excited to get to it cause it's one of the,
[17:18.620 --> 17:21.660]  I did a lot of a lot of research and it was one of my favorite parts to get to.
[17:21.660 --> 17:24.600]  Cause there's a buttload of people who moved here that didn't know how to do
[17:24.600 --> 17:28.420]  none of this and don't meet the requirements. And so they're fucked. Yeah.
[17:29.420 --> 17:32.980]  Or they're stuck trying to get a job doing whatever it was they were doing that
[17:32.980 --> 17:36.180]  they hated so much. They moved across the country to work in legal weed.
[17:36.180 --> 17:38.860]  Or they're trying to set up a black market grow to survive. Right.
[17:38.860 --> 17:40.020]  And they're struggling. All right.
[17:40.020 --> 17:40.900]  So the first thing you got to do,
[17:40.900 --> 17:42.820]  if you want to get a badge here in the state of Colorado,
[17:43.620 --> 17:48.020]  you have got to find the application online and they will put the application in
[17:48.020 --> 17:49.900]  the show notes. I'll put a link to the application.
[17:50.660 --> 17:52.740]  Let me read you the website address.
[17:52.780 --> 17:55.500]  If you've got a pen and paper or if you want to type this into your web browser
[17:55.500 --> 17:59.660]  quickly, it is colorado.gov slash Pacific.
[17:59.900 --> 18:01.020]  The word Pacific. Yes.
[18:01.020 --> 18:05.820]  Colorado.gov slash Pacific slash enforcement slash medical
[18:06.780 --> 18:11.420]  dash marijuana dash occupational dash licensing.
[18:11.500 --> 18:16.100]  So it's colorado.gov slash Pacific slash enforcement slash medical
[18:16.100 --> 18:18.700]  dash marijuana dash occupational licensing.
[18:19.100 --> 18:21.300]  So long as URL. Yeah. Yeah.
[18:21.300 --> 18:23.620]  Well hopefully somebody typed that into their web browser.
[18:23.820 --> 18:26.260]  Hopefully somebody got that, wrote it down. I'll put it in the show notes,
[18:26.540 --> 18:29.380]  but that's where you need to go to get the application. That's where you start.
[18:29.580 --> 18:32.500]  It's not super hard to find if you just Google it by name.
[18:32.780 --> 18:35.020]  Right. There are a lot of things to filter through though.
[18:35.020 --> 18:37.020]  It's confusing on what you're looking for. Yeah.
[18:37.020 --> 18:41.060]  It does take a minute of reading and kind of clicking around to find the actual
[18:41.060 --> 18:43.860]  application that you need because they've got like four of them post. Right.
[18:43.860 --> 18:46.900]  And you're looking for either a key badge or a support badge.
[18:46.900 --> 18:48.660]  And we'll talk about that in just a couple of seconds.
[18:48.660 --> 18:53.020]  I think I made a note to talk about that. So, um, find the application,
[18:53.500 --> 18:54.940]  read and review the application.
[18:54.980 --> 18:59.060]  You'll get to a part that says this marijuana occupational employee application
[18:59.060 --> 19:00.500]  form is an official document.
[19:00.500 --> 19:04.180]  If you provide false information on your marijuana license application and or do
[19:04.220 --> 19:06.820]  not disclose all information, the application asks,
[19:07.140 --> 19:09.980]  your license is subject to denial or revocation,
[19:09.980 --> 19:12.820]  and you may be subject to criminal prosecution.
[19:13.100 --> 19:15.820]  The marijuana enforcement division will conduct a complete background
[19:15.820 --> 19:18.460]  investigation and we'll check all sources of information.
[19:18.460 --> 19:23.380]  You are advised that it is better to disclose all information than face denial,
[19:23.460 --> 19:26.540]  revocation, or criminal prosecution. So guys,
[19:26.540 --> 19:28.580]  they're not bullshitting when they say that. Uh,
[19:28.580 --> 19:32.140]  I know a guy named Tim who has been waiting months and months for his badge
[19:32.140 --> 19:34.260]  because they are doing a thorough investigation.
[19:34.260 --> 19:36.140]  They found some stuff on his record. Uh,
[19:36.140 --> 19:38.020]  they're contacting the state where that happened.
[19:38.020 --> 19:42.220]  They're talking to the actual judge that resided over my friend's case to find
[19:42.220 --> 19:45.180]  out if he can get his badge or not. And it's been a long time.
[19:45.180 --> 19:47.140]  He writes them letters all the time and they reply with,
[19:47.140 --> 19:50.500]  we're still investigating, sir. We'll get back to you. So they're not bullshitting.
[19:50.500 --> 19:54.460]  They're going to go through this. They're not kidding. Disclose your shit.
[19:54.700 --> 19:58.780]  So, uh, it says, if you need clarification of any of the following questions,
[19:58.780 --> 20:01.660]  please contact any marijuana enforcement division office.
[20:01.900 --> 20:03.740]  So that means if it's not clear to you,
[20:03.820 --> 20:07.500]  call them because they do not tell you exactly what's up.
[20:07.660 --> 20:12.380]  And when we get into the requirements in a minute, like we'll get more specific,
[20:12.380 --> 20:15.220]  but like really just tell the truth. There's no fudge in this. Yep.
[20:15.260 --> 20:17.820]  No, the requirements, if you don't meet them straight up,
[20:17.820 --> 20:20.260]  don't try cause you ain't going to get passed. And if you do,
[20:20.260 --> 20:23.940]  it's a special crime. This is the age of the internet. If you did some shit,
[20:24.660 --> 20:26.740]  it's on paper. Just write it down. They don't,
[20:26.780 --> 20:30.380]  they really don't care as long as it violates the couple of requirements and
[20:30.380 --> 20:32.540]  they play those straight up and down for the most part.
[20:32.540 --> 20:36.660]  I've only heard one person who didn't get their badge and they tried to make it
[20:36.660 --> 20:38.900]  sound like a big conspiracy. And it was like, nah, dude,
[20:38.900 --> 20:41.460]  it was that felony three years ago. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[20:42.060 --> 20:45.540]  Well let's read the, uh, the disqualifying conditions. It says, uh,
[20:45.580 --> 20:46.860]  these questions go like this.
[20:46.880 --> 20:51.820]  Have you ever discharged a sentence for a conviction of a felony pursuant to any
[20:51.820 --> 20:55.620]  state or federal law regarding the possession, distribution, manufacturing,
[20:55.620 --> 20:57.820]  cultivation, or use of a controlled substance,
[20:58.220 --> 21:00.940]  including probation or parole within the last 10 years,
[21:00.980 --> 21:03.540]  even if the conviction occurred more than 10 years ago.
[21:04.220 --> 21:06.220]  So that means if you've been in jail for any felon,
[21:06.340 --> 21:08.140]  does that what that means? Discharge the sentence.
[21:08.140 --> 21:12.060]  That's no drug felonies in 10 years is what that question's asking about.
[21:12.060 --> 21:16.980]  Like you have to have completed the jail sentence and any probation or
[21:17.000 --> 21:21.100]  parole at least 10 years before you apply for your Med badge.
[21:21.900 --> 21:25.540]  So 10 years ago, you guys, if you had a drug felony, 10 years,
[21:25.540 --> 21:28.660]  let's be specific. It says drug felony.
[21:28.900 --> 21:33.100]  So you had to have drugs involved in your felony and it has to be more than 10
[21:33.120 --> 21:37.420]  years ago. If that happened, if it was nine years and 365 days,
[21:37.420 --> 21:39.180]  cause it's fucking leap year, uh,
[21:40.420 --> 21:42.140]  then you're still not able to qualify.
[21:42.140 --> 21:46.580]  You got to wait another day and then apply. Yep. So, uh, condition number two,
[21:46.580 --> 21:49.700]  have you served a sentence including probation parole, uh,
[21:49.720 --> 21:52.700]  within the last five years upon conviction for any felony,
[21:52.700 --> 21:56.460]  even if the conviction occurred more than five years ago. So once again,
[21:56.460 --> 22:00.460]  if you're on probation or parole five years ago or within the last five years,
[22:00.860 --> 22:02.540]  you are not allowed to work in the industry.
[22:02.540 --> 22:06.780]  So no drug felonies in 10 no felonies period and five, uh,
[22:06.800 --> 22:08.340]  or probation or parole. Yep.
[22:08.340 --> 22:12.220]  And the probation and parole for many of those felonies has to be done at least
[22:12.220 --> 22:14.100]  that many years ago. And then this one is neat.
[22:14.140 --> 22:17.900]  Are you a licensed physician making patient recommendations? Yep.
[22:17.940 --> 22:20.700]  If you're a doctor in the industry, you can't be affiliated,
[22:20.700 --> 22:23.500]  affiliated with a dispensary or involved with that part of it.
[22:23.500 --> 22:26.780]  So you don't need a badge. That makes good sense. I understand.
[22:27.300 --> 22:28.740]  That rule kind of makes sense.
[22:28.740 --> 22:30.820]  And I really get where they're going with the felony rule.
[22:30.860 --> 22:35.700]  They're really trying to play it so that the state can say with all
[22:35.740 --> 22:40.620]  reassurance that people who were dealing drugs in the past aren't
[22:40.640 --> 22:41.780]  owning dispensaries.
[22:42.420 --> 22:46.100]  And an easy way to do that is to make sure that anyone convicted of selling
[22:46.120 --> 22:49.900]  drugs doesn't get to be a dispensary owner for at least the first decade.
[22:50.620 --> 22:52.060]  Um, and yeah,
[22:52.060 --> 22:55.020]  that kind of sucks for people who got busted back in the day and they're not
[22:55.040 --> 22:59.700]  trying to be totally straight up legal, but that's how Colorado wants to play.
[22:59.700 --> 23:00.660]  And this physician part,
[23:00.660 --> 23:03.820]  they just don't want you to be a doctor hanging out in a dispensary.
[23:05.660 --> 23:07.380]  Yeah. Yeah. All right. Number four says,
[23:07.400 --> 23:10.820]  have you had your authority to act as primary care caregiver revoked by the
[23:10.820 --> 23:13.260]  state health agency? So if you're,
[23:13.420 --> 23:17.060]  you were somebody who's primary caregiver as not under the medical marijuana type
[23:17.060 --> 23:20.380]  of caregiver, but as our caregiver for somebody who is elderly or disabled,
[23:20.380 --> 23:23.460]  if that's been revoked, you are not allowed to work in the cannabis industry.
[23:23.900 --> 23:26.660]  The next question is, are you under 21 years of age?
[23:26.660 --> 23:30.620]  You have to be 21 years old when you apply. Yep. Got to be 21.
[23:30.780 --> 23:34.500]  That's not too hard to figure out. 21. The next question says, are,
[23:34.580 --> 23:37.420]  are not question, but, uh, let me take a sip here. Hold on. Talk, Mike.
[23:38.940 --> 23:42.660]  I don't know what the next question is, but I can guess a student loans and child
[23:42.680 --> 23:46.500]  support. Not yet. Nope. Those are further down the list.
[23:46.500 --> 23:49.060]  Sorry for the teaser. Uh, no, that'll come up in a little bit though.
[23:49.060 --> 23:52.100]  That's not on this list. Uh, thanks for the time to take a drink. Excuse me.
[23:52.500 --> 23:56.740]  It says, are you the shitty Phil? You were under pressure, bro. That's cool.
[23:56.940 --> 24:00.340]  Are you the spouse or child living in the household of any person employed by the
[24:00.340 --> 24:03.900]  Colorado marijuana enforcement division? So if you're,
[24:03.900 --> 24:06.700]  I'm not working for both sides. Yeah. Yeah. If your mom,
[24:06.980 --> 24:09.300]  you can't be a regulator and a profiteer.
[24:09.900 --> 24:12.460]  Your mom works at the MED. You can't have a badge. Sorry.
[24:13.060 --> 24:16.740]  Tell mom that, uh, she's got to like disown you or something.
[24:17.380 --> 24:20.460]  So you can get your badge. Yeah. Probably don't do that.
[24:20.500 --> 24:22.420]  Tell her to switch sides, tell her to get on the right team.
[24:22.500 --> 24:23.420]  Tell her to join the force.
[24:23.460 --> 24:27.220]  There's special rules to prevent that from happening for a chunk of years.
[24:27.220 --> 24:28.500]  When you join the MED now,
[24:28.520 --> 24:33.380]  because a bunch of people were going to work for the MED going through training,
[24:33.380 --> 24:36.580]  doing a bunch of MED inspections for like three or four months,
[24:36.620 --> 24:40.340]  and then getting a job at a dispensary for like 10 times the pay, um,
[24:40.340 --> 24:43.180]  they need to be a compliance officer because they could put on their resume,
[24:43.180 --> 24:45.660]  MED officer. Oh, wow. That's a good idea.
[24:45.860 --> 24:48.180]  And so it was happening so much.
[24:48.180 --> 24:52.900]  The MED had to pass special like non-compete clause rules that they have to
[24:52.900 --> 24:56.220]  sign contracts when they get their job at the MED now. That's pretty good.
[24:56.240 --> 25:00.420]  I like it. I like it. Uh, and then the next one, uh, and the last one,
[25:00.820 --> 25:03.220]  are you a sheriff, deputy sheriff, police officer,
[25:03.220 --> 25:06.980]  or prosecuting officer or any officer or employee of the marijuana state
[25:06.980 --> 25:10.220]  licensing authority or a local licensing authority?
[25:10.780 --> 25:14.460]  Yup. And then the next, the next little, uh, cops don't get no badges.
[25:14.500 --> 25:18.620]  The next little note here says, stop. If you answered yes to any of the,
[25:18.660 --> 25:20.620]  of the above questions by Colorado law,
[25:20.620 --> 25:25.300]  you cannot obtain or hold a Colorado marijuana occupational employee license.
[25:25.780 --> 25:29.620]  Yup. Those are just straight up. You can't get a license period. Don't try.
[25:29.620 --> 25:32.420]  We'll find it with the FBI background check. Yup. So if you heard,
[25:32.420 --> 25:35.020]  if you qualify under any of that shit that we just read,
[25:35.420 --> 25:38.860]  you cannot work in Colorado in the legal marijuana industry.
[25:39.100 --> 25:42.860]  You're going to have to go to California or Washington or Oregon or maybe
[25:42.860 --> 25:45.500]  Michigan or who else is legal now, Mike, where can people go?
[25:45.660 --> 25:50.020]  Um, other legal States, Alaska, Washington, Oregon,
[25:50.100 --> 25:52.900]  DC sorta go up there with Charlotte, Alaska.
[25:53.020 --> 25:57.420]  There's 23 medical marijuana States. Get online, look at the laws in each one,
[25:57.420 --> 25:59.180]  see which ones you can still work for.
[25:59.380 --> 26:03.300]  Or, or, or what you should really do wherever you are.
[26:04.420 --> 26:07.740]  Make the laws better, make it legalized cannabis where you are.
[26:08.060 --> 26:10.340]  If you can't work in the legal industry,
[26:10.340 --> 26:12.620]  that doesn't mean you can't lobby on its behalf.
[26:12.660 --> 26:15.180]  That's the truth. Shout out to Darrell. If you listen to the podcast,
[26:15.180 --> 26:17.780]  I'm just going to throw that out there. Uh, yeah, you can,
[26:17.940 --> 26:20.820]  you can do what you can do for your area. Maybe you can't be a grower.
[26:20.820 --> 26:23.980]  Maybe you can't be a manager. Maybe you can't be an owner,
[26:23.980 --> 26:26.700]  but you can always be a lobbyist. You can be an activist.
[26:26.700 --> 26:29.580]  You can do your part in some way, shape or form. That is for sure.
[26:29.820 --> 26:33.580]  So after it asks, asks you all these questions and when you check no to them or
[26:33.580 --> 26:34.420]  yes to them,
[26:34.460 --> 26:36.980]  it makes you sign and it says I have thoroughly read and understand the
[26:36.980 --> 26:40.380]  questions above and understand that I cannot hold a Colorado marijuana license.
[26:40.620 --> 26:43.740]  If at any time in the future I can ever answer yes,
[26:44.900 --> 26:48.900]  answer if at any time in the future I can ever answer yes to any of the
[26:48.900 --> 26:50.740]  questions above. That's weirdly worded.
[26:51.980 --> 26:56.340]  But it's, it's crazy legal talk for if the answer to this changes,
[26:56.340 --> 26:59.740]  like if you committed a felony nine years ago and two years past,
[26:59.780 --> 27:04.780]  oh God, that felony conviction and all your shit with it was over 10 years ago.
[27:04.820 --> 27:09.100]  Like you're good to go now. All right. You can reapply or apply period.
[27:09.780 --> 27:14.500]  So then there's also an arrest disclosure forum form. Uh,
[27:14.540 --> 27:17.740]  if it says if since turning age 18 have you ever been arrested,
[27:17.740 --> 27:18.860]  served criminal summons,
[27:18.860 --> 27:22.340]  charged with or convicted of any crime regarding the possession distribution or
[27:22.340 --> 27:23.620]  use of a controlled substance,
[27:23.620 --> 27:27.060]  you must disclose this information to the marijuana enforcement division.
[27:27.380 --> 27:31.100]  Make sure you get them all on there too. Cause oops, I forgot that one.
[27:31.340 --> 27:32.660]  Looks really fucking bad.
[27:33.460 --> 27:37.460]  They give you plenty of space to list. Yep. Holy crap. Uh,
[27:37.500 --> 27:40.340]  check any of the following or professional licenses you have held.
[27:40.340 --> 27:42.380]  So it asks which licenses you've had.
[27:42.380 --> 27:45.780]  It asks if you've had a liquor license or a lawyer license or a racing license,
[27:45.780 --> 27:48.500]  a lottery license. So it's going to ask you a lot of crazy questions.
[27:48.620 --> 27:51.940]  Fill all of this out truthfully. Okay. So, uh,
[27:51.940 --> 27:55.140]  read the disqualifying conditions. If you qualify,
[27:55.220 --> 27:57.540]  then print out the application. Don't fucking print it.
[27:57.540 --> 28:00.580]  It's like 10 pages of paper. Let's see. There's several pages here.
[28:00.700 --> 28:02.180]  Yeah. Read through it.
[28:02.700 --> 28:04.780]  Yeah. Make sure you meet the qualifications.
[28:04.980 --> 28:09.660]  The ones we read you verbatim are the, the automatic disqualification ones.
[28:10.340 --> 28:13.500]  If you start checking yes to some of the ones we're talking about now,
[28:13.980 --> 28:17.540]  that doesn't automatically mean a no. It means you got some explaining to do.
[28:17.940 --> 28:20.500]  No, those, those, okay. Yeah. The first ones were nos.
[28:20.620 --> 28:24.900]  Yeah. The first ones are automatic. No's. It's, it's a felony in 10 years, uh,
[28:24.980 --> 28:29.140]  or a felony in five years, a drug related felony in 10. Um,
[28:30.060 --> 28:34.340]  if you're a cop or I don't remember what the last one was, um, copper doctor,
[28:34.460 --> 28:37.300]  those all disqualify you. Those all DQ you automatically,
[28:37.300 --> 28:40.020]  but the only two of those that apply to most of the people listening to the show
[28:40.020 --> 28:42.620]  are the first two. All right. All right.
[28:42.940 --> 28:46.340]  You don't think any cops listened to the show? Well, maybe, maybe.
[28:46.660 --> 28:48.580]  I hope there are cops out there to listen.
[28:48.580 --> 28:51.180]  I really hope there are law enforcement officers listening to the show and
[28:51.180 --> 28:52.020]  becoming educated.
[28:52.740 --> 28:55.580]  There's probably a couple, you know, I have a number of listeners.
[28:55.620 --> 28:58.540]  There was an event that we did for the show. We did a live show somewhere,
[28:58.860 --> 29:00.060]  place doesn't exist anymore,
[29:00.060 --> 29:03.300]  but we did a live show somewhere and we invited people to come and I made flyers
[29:03.300 --> 29:07.900]  for the show. Right. And I put out flyers for the podcast to come to while people,
[29:07.900 --> 29:09.380]  it was a smoking place.
[29:09.460 --> 29:13.140]  I remember because I used to sit in a room with a number of members of law
[29:13.140 --> 29:15.500]  enforcement every Monday night. Okay. Okay.
[29:15.500 --> 29:19.740]  So like when this happened that I was keenly aware of how many officers were in
[29:19.740 --> 29:21.140]  that room every Monday night.
[29:21.900 --> 29:25.740]  I put out flyers to listen to the podcast at a smoking event and somehow law
[29:25.820 --> 29:29.140]  enforcement found the flyers and thought that they were like some sort of tickets
[29:29.140 --> 29:32.780]  to get free weed at the event or something. And so in the next episode,
[29:32.780 --> 29:33.860]  I gave a shout out to the cops,
[29:33.860 --> 29:36.260]  hoping that they were listening because they had the flyers and it said how to
[29:36.260 --> 29:38.100]  listen. I had a little QR code. If you scanned it,
[29:38.100 --> 29:39.900]  it would take you to iTunes and you could hear the show.
[29:40.260 --> 29:42.500]  So if you're in law enforcement, I appreciate you for listening.
[29:42.500 --> 29:44.460]  I hope you're learning the truth about cannabis. It's not evil.
[29:44.460 --> 29:47.220]  It's not terrible. It doesn't ruin anybody. We're not that scary.
[29:47.260 --> 29:49.300]  We do understand that there are laws that you have to enforce,
[29:49.300 --> 29:51.740]  but we wish that you would do what you can to change the laws.
[29:51.740 --> 29:54.140]  Cause I'm sure you see that it's not a problem where you are officer.
[29:54.140 --> 29:56.220]  Much respect for you. Thanks for doing what you do. All right.
[29:56.220 --> 29:58.380]  So print the application. That's the next step here.
[29:58.380 --> 30:01.220]  We're going to keep this show on track. Mike's got ADD today. Uh,
[30:01.260 --> 30:04.020]  print the application, complete the application. That shouldn't be too hard.
[30:04.460 --> 30:08.900]  So at that point, obtain any court papers that you need, any, uh,
[30:08.940 --> 30:11.020]  arrest disclosure forms, anything like that.
[30:11.020 --> 30:12.900]  If you've got tax paper forms that you need,
[30:12.900 --> 30:16.580]  if you have child support paper forms that you need, uh, print all that,
[30:16.580 --> 30:18.740]  find those papers. Um,
[30:18.820 --> 30:23.220]  then you need to make an appointment. The Denver office, uh,
[30:23.260 --> 30:25.820]  in Longmont accepts walk-ins in grand junction.
[30:25.820 --> 30:29.140]  You need to make an appointment in Springs. You need to make an appointment. Uh,
[30:29.140 --> 30:31.580]  the phone number is on the website. I guess I could have had that for you.
[30:31.580 --> 30:33.620]  I do not. I apologize. I failed you there.
[30:33.620 --> 30:36.140]  You're going to have to do a little bit of this on your own. Uh,
[30:36.140 --> 30:38.300]  so call and make an appointment. Uh,
[30:38.340 --> 30:42.540]  it's way easier to call and make an appointment in Springs than it is to sit
[30:42.540 --> 30:44.700]  there and wait for like three hours in Denver. Yep.
[30:44.740 --> 30:48.420]  That's what I did. And it kind of sucked. You waited all day in Denver. Yep. Uh,
[30:48.420 --> 30:50.100]  I made my appointment for Colorado Springs.
[30:50.100 --> 30:53.460]  I showed up about 15 minutes early because I thought it would take much longer
[30:53.460 --> 30:55.060]  to get there. It's hard to judge. I 25,
[30:55.060 --> 30:57.340]  it could take you an hour or an hour and a half to get from here to there.
[30:57.700 --> 31:00.380]  So I got there about 15 minutes early and the lady was like, Hey,
[31:00.380 --> 31:04.420]  the guy that was scheduled before you didn't show up. Uh, are you ready?
[31:04.460 --> 31:07.940]  And I was like, well, fuck yeah, I'm ready. And it took her, uh, I don't know,
[31:07.940 --> 31:11.340]  maybe an hour to do the entire process. She fingerprinted me, interviewed me.
[31:11.620 --> 31:14.180]  Uh, that's why you're waiting all day in Denver is cause that's how long it
[31:14.180 --> 31:17.860]  takes. Right. And there's a lot of other people just showed up every day.
[31:18.700 --> 31:21.380]  And just relax on their fingerprinting you. It's easy. And you know what?
[31:21.380 --> 31:22.860]  If you've got warrants or something,
[31:22.900 --> 31:26.420]  if you're wanted in the state of Colorado and you're in the MED office getting
[31:26.420 --> 31:29.660]  your shit done, they run your ID. And if you're wanted,
[31:29.700 --> 31:31.140]  they come and fucking arrest you.
[31:31.260 --> 31:34.180]  Yeah. We really can't emphasize like read the questions.
[31:34.220 --> 31:38.860]  And if the answer is yes to the first four or you've got like active warrants out
[31:38.860 --> 31:40.460]  now, don't apply.
[31:40.500 --> 31:43.300]  Don't apply because I'm not even kidding. They will come arrest.
[31:43.340 --> 31:45.780]  If you're getting fingerprinted and they run your shit and you're wanted by the
[31:45.780 --> 31:49.820]  FBI, there's a sign on the door that says unmarked or plain clothes,
[31:49.820 --> 31:53.660]  security officer on premises at all times. He will come and arrest you.
[31:54.020 --> 31:56.300]  I spent three and a half hours trying to find the dude.
[31:56.300 --> 32:01.140]  And I think I found both of them. Um, like they're not playing around.
[32:01.860 --> 32:06.260]  Uh, read the questions, answer them honestly for the, the secondary questions,
[32:07.420 --> 32:12.300]  um, like child support and student loans. If you've got any of those, you know,
[32:12.300 --> 32:13.620]  any of those questions apply to you,
[32:13.620 --> 32:15.940]  you're going to need to contact that institution.
[32:16.460 --> 32:21.300]  Like I had to contact everybody I've got student loans with and get a paper that
[32:21.300 --> 32:23.140]  says my student loans are in good standing,
[32:23.140 --> 32:25.260]  which means if you've been ducking that shit for a decade,
[32:25.260 --> 32:28.660]  you need to stand up, take the punch, set up a payment plan,
[32:28.660 --> 32:31.060]  start making payments. You only need to make one payment.
[32:31.060 --> 32:34.340]  Same thing with child support, right? If your child support is fucked up.
[32:34.660 --> 32:37.020]  I was cool. Cause mine's legit. But if your child support is fucked up,
[32:37.020 --> 32:40.060]  they will make you get a paper from your caseworker that says that you're paying
[32:40.100 --> 32:41.180]  them, that you're doing what you can.
[32:41.380 --> 32:46.380]  If you had felonies 17 years ago or over the deadline and you're good to go,
[32:48.140 --> 32:52.660]  you need paperwork from the court that adjudicated your felony in the original
[32:52.660 --> 32:53.340]  jurisdiction.
[32:53.340 --> 32:56.900]  You got to fucking contact the court that tried and sends to you and get the
[32:56.900 --> 32:59.780]  paperwork from them that says you completed successfully.
[32:59.780 --> 33:03.140]  And on what date you completed for every fucking felony.
[33:03.580 --> 33:05.580]  And it can be a real pain. You've got, I mean,
[33:05.620 --> 33:09.900]  I've talked to people in Denver while I was waiting that had to go to like seven
[33:09.940 --> 33:14.500]  different courthouses to pick up stuff that they got between 20 or like 18 and
[33:14.500 --> 33:17.740]  20. And then they've been perfect for a decade,
[33:17.740 --> 33:21.300]  but they had still had to spend four days driving between courthouses,
[33:21.300 --> 33:25.260]  getting paperwork so that they could then apply to work in the legal marijuana
[33:25.260 --> 33:29.420]  industry. Like have your shit together. And some, for some of you,
[33:29.420 --> 33:31.420]  that's going to be a lot of paperwork gathering.
[33:31.580 --> 33:34.660]  If you don't have it together, the lady at the MED office or the man,
[33:34.660 --> 33:36.620]  the person that helped me was a lady. So I always think it's a lady,
[33:36.620 --> 33:38.660]  but the person that helps you at the MED office,
[33:39.060 --> 33:42.900]  they will give you a list of everything that you need after you fail the first
[33:42.900 --> 33:43.140]  time.
[33:43.140 --> 33:46.500]  Yep. That's the first step of the process when you get there and it's your turn
[33:46.500 --> 33:51.300]  as they go through your shit piece by piece and make sure you have everything.
[33:52.420 --> 33:56.300]  Um, and when I got done, it was very clearly like, you have everything.
[33:56.500 --> 33:58.420]  It's your first try. Wow. High five.
[33:58.460 --> 34:00.260]  That's kind of, yeah, yeah. Well, I was well prepared.
[34:00.260 --> 34:01.820]  I knew plenty of people that have badges.
[34:01.820 --> 34:06.260]  So I was the same way. Yeah. So we, neither of us had an issue,
[34:06.260 --> 34:09.580]  but we've all talked to countless people that have no idea what this process
[34:09.580 --> 34:13.940]  looks like. They even moved to Colorado, moved across the country unprepared.
[34:14.500 --> 34:17.740]  And so knowing this and doing it right is sort of essential folks.
[34:17.780 --> 34:20.300]  If you've got 44 felonies, you're probably not going to get it.
[34:20.340 --> 34:23.300]  I've been thinking about him this whole show. Shout out to our buddy 44.
[34:23.340 --> 34:24.180]  Shout out, buddy.
[34:24.180 --> 34:26.980]  Nobody's ever known why we call him 44 and that's the only hint we're going to
[34:26.980 --> 34:30.540]  give you. So, um, we're going to keep moving when you show up. Okay.
[34:30.540 --> 34:33.340]  The next step is show up and complete the damn interview. Uh,
[34:33.540 --> 34:37.180]  it's an MEP interview. It doesn't matter what you want. Comb your hair.
[34:37.300 --> 34:40.180]  If you do that, uh, if you got dreadlocks, flatten them down,
[34:40.180 --> 34:41.340]  cause they're going to make you take off your hat.
[34:41.340 --> 34:43.020]  They're going to make you take a picture hat off.
[34:43.020 --> 34:45.660]  And then you're going to wear the picture they take around your neck for the
[34:45.660 --> 34:49.780]  next two years. Uh, bro, I'm six, five. And that picture place,
[34:49.780 --> 34:51.460]  they have like a little, like a,
[34:51.580 --> 34:54.820]  a swatch on the floor of or on the wall of material where you're supposed to
[34:54.820 --> 34:58.220]  stand in front of that. Shit's like five, 10, like where most people are.
[34:58.220 --> 35:01.060]  So I got to do a squat. So I'm trying to smile as I'm doing,
[35:01.900 --> 35:04.220]  but not real far. Yeah, it was pretty funny. All right.
[35:04.220 --> 35:07.460]  So when you show up for the place, when you show up for the interview, uh,
[35:07.460 --> 35:10.460]  bring the completed application, have that shit filled out before you get there,
[35:10.740 --> 35:13.780]  bring your ID, bring your court papers and disclosure forms.
[35:13.780 --> 35:17.740]  If you've got any of those to bring with you, uh, bring proof of residency.
[35:17.740 --> 35:20.940]  If you don't have a, if you're new to Colorado and your ID,
[35:20.980 --> 35:23.380]  if you do have an out of state ID, that's what the fuck I'm trying to say.
[35:23.380 --> 35:24.700]  If your ID is from out of state,
[35:24.980 --> 35:27.780]  bring proof of residency that you do live in the state of Colorado,
[35:27.780 --> 35:31.500]  bring a phone bill, bring a fucking cable bill, bring the light bill,
[35:31.500 --> 35:32.340]  bring whatever you got.
[35:32.500 --> 35:35.940]  This goes back to column and they'll tell you exactly what you need.
[35:35.940 --> 35:41.020]  And this is the time to bring up my ID says I'm from Texas or Tennessee or
[35:41.020 --> 35:43.260]  wherever the fuck, like bring it out.
[35:43.620 --> 35:47.180]  And they'll tell you exactly what you need supporting paperwork wise.
[35:47.180 --> 35:51.540]  If you've got felonies, they'll tell you what to, what to ask the courts for. Um,
[35:51.540 --> 35:55.060]  same thing with your child support stuff. They told me exactly what to say.
[35:55.140 --> 35:56.900]  It's all on the application when you look at it.
[35:57.060 --> 35:58.980]  And they're happy to answer these questions.
[35:58.980 --> 36:03.700]  Super important. They do not take cash, bring a money order or bring a check.
[36:03.780 --> 36:05.900]  If you're going to get your key badge,
[36:05.900 --> 36:07.340]  and this is where we'll talk about this part.
[36:07.340 --> 36:10.900]  If you're going to get your key badge, it's going to cost you $300.
[36:11.220 --> 36:14.940]  If you want your support badge, it is $150. Mike looked at me, is that wrong,
[36:14.940 --> 36:16.060]  dude? Cause I just looked at the website.
[36:16.060 --> 36:19.860]  The prices were right, but I think Denver takes cash. I'm like 85%.
[36:20.100 --> 36:23.220]  I said that to somebody else that was helping me with this episode.
[36:23.220 --> 36:24.060]  Shout out to Jessica.
[36:24.060 --> 36:24.900]  She's like,
[36:25.500 --> 36:28.980]  will not accept cash. And the website says bring check or money order.
[36:28.980 --> 36:30.780]  So I'm pretty sure they quit accepting cash.
[36:31.060 --> 36:34.540]  Just that would surprise me. I knew that only one office did,
[36:34.540 --> 36:36.860]  and I could have sworn it was Denver, but I might've taken a check.
[36:36.900 --> 36:39.940]  I worked at a place that had a lot of cash flow.
[36:39.940 --> 36:42.700]  Like we had a lot of cash in the end of the register at the end of the day.
[36:42.700 --> 36:47.180]  I've worked at several places and just imagine how many applications they handle
[36:47.180 --> 36:47.500]  a day.
[36:47.500 --> 36:52.500]  $150 a badge minimum times 16,000 employees.
[36:53.260 --> 36:56.060]  Imagine divided by 365 days. People, you can do the math.
[36:56.620 --> 37:00.460]  You just don't want that much money in a box in the office anywhere.
[37:00.540 --> 37:03.780]  Like over a couple of days, that box is going to be full of cash.
[37:03.780 --> 37:06.060]  So I understand they probably, they just be prepared.
[37:06.060 --> 37:08.100]  You guys take a check or take a money order.
[37:08.260 --> 37:11.500]  Just stop it somewhere that sells a money order. Freaking Walmart sucks.
[37:11.500 --> 37:14.260]  They have money orders. I think most Walgreens will sell you a money order.
[37:14.340 --> 37:17.620]  Several seven 11s will seven 11. We'll do it. You can go to the post office,
[37:17.940 --> 37:20.820]  get yourself a money order, go to the MED place.
[37:20.820 --> 37:24.020]  Now let's talk about the difference between a key badge and a support badge.
[37:24.420 --> 37:27.060]  There always has to be a support badge on premises.
[37:27.260 --> 37:30.220]  Nobody can be in my grow without a support badge.
[37:30.220 --> 37:32.260]  There either has to be a red badge, which is the owner badge.
[37:32.260 --> 37:34.700]  You have to own the place to get that one or a key badge.
[37:34.700 --> 37:38.100]  If you don't have a key badge, if there's not a key badge on premises,
[37:38.140 --> 37:41.220]  nobody else can be in there. None of the support badges can be in the room.
[37:41.620 --> 37:46.620]  So I find it advantageous to go ahead and get that key badge because then you're
[37:46.980 --> 37:48.660]  kind of more qualified to do more shit.
[37:48.700 --> 37:52.100]  You've already got more ability to take on more responsibility.
[37:52.740 --> 37:55.580]  I made sure to get the key. Yeah. And did it help you?
[37:55.580 --> 37:59.940]  Do you feel like getting your key badge helped you advance in your position at
[37:59.940 --> 38:03.620]  the spot? I think those rules are more heavily enforced on the medical side.
[38:04.420 --> 38:08.260]  Um, okay. Or maybe I'm just, no,
[38:08.340 --> 38:11.420]  I've got to be the odd, the only support badge several nights a week at work.
[38:11.740 --> 38:14.780]  That might be why, or my only key badge. That might be why I got promoted.
[38:14.900 --> 38:16.980]  Yeah. Yes. One, one of my promotions.
[38:16.980 --> 38:20.500]  It just makes you more promotable. So a support badge,
[38:20.540 --> 38:23.980]  you can be like a bud tender. You can be a trimmer. You can be a joint roller.
[38:24.500 --> 38:27.820]  You can in the gardens, you can support badges, the starter badge.
[38:27.820 --> 38:30.580]  Like if you've only got one 50 to spend on a badge and you know,
[38:30.580 --> 38:34.260]  you're going to be a trimmer for the first year, like a bud tender or a bud tender,
[38:34.260 --> 38:36.740]  you can go ahead and get the support. Like we're not saying don't,
[38:36.740 --> 38:40.700]  but the key badge definitely gives you more opportunities in the industry.
[38:40.700 --> 38:44.940]  And if you're one of those people that's moving to Colorado with a degree in
[38:44.940 --> 38:47.340]  biochemistry, um,
[38:47.580 --> 38:51.500]  like you might want to go ahead and get the support badge or the key badge.
[38:51.500 --> 38:53.100]  I'm sorry. I'm mixing those two.
[38:53.540 --> 38:56.660]  I was trying to figure you confused me. So that's all right.
[38:56.820 --> 38:58.700]  Yeah. The key badge is the more important one.
[38:58.780 --> 39:00.220]  I was looking for the distinguishing.
[39:00.380 --> 39:01.860]  It says something about on the application.
[39:01.860 --> 39:05.540]  If you're going to have keys and be in charge of employees and have access to
[39:05.540 --> 39:08.660]  limited access areas, you should go ahead and get a key badge.
[39:08.660 --> 39:11.260]  So I recommend of course get the key badge. If you don't have the money for it,
[39:11.260 --> 39:13.540]  get yourself a support badge. If you're an ambitious,
[39:13.700 --> 39:15.860]  ambitious person and you feel like you want to move up,
[39:15.860 --> 39:17.900]  if you're going to manage that, bitch, get the key,
[39:18.060 --> 39:20.380]  go ahead and get a key badge. If you want to work with the grow team,
[39:20.380 --> 39:22.660]  if you're real enthusiastic and you can show that you can do it,
[39:22.660 --> 39:23.740]  get yourself a key badge.
[39:24.060 --> 39:26.420]  We'd love to see you move up in the industry super quickly.
[39:26.460 --> 39:29.100]  I knew I wasn't going to be on the bottom rung for long.
[39:29.100 --> 39:30.820]  So I fully got that one on purpose.
[39:30.820 --> 39:33.260]  Like I know a lot of other people that did that too.
[39:33.660 --> 39:37.420]  And I know a couple of people who got the support and have been kind of passed
[39:37.420 --> 39:40.940]  over several times because they can't meet some of those requirements that you
[39:40.940 --> 39:41.860]  have to have the key for.
[39:41.860 --> 39:43.980]  Got to have a key badge on premises at all times.
[39:44.820 --> 39:48.260]  I got to be pretty much in the same room with the support badges.
[39:48.580 --> 39:51.340]  You can't even leave them in another room. So, all right.
[39:51.580 --> 39:54.780]  So if you want to be like the cultivation manager, get a key badge.
[39:54.780 --> 39:56.780]  If you want to be a trim team leader, get a key badge.
[39:56.940 --> 39:59.020]  Maybe even if you want to be lead bud tender,
[39:59.020 --> 40:02.140]  you might need a key badge because you'll be carrying product back to the
[40:02.140 --> 40:06.100]  storage room, which requires a key badge to get into, or at least it should.
[40:06.860 --> 40:10.140]  So get your badge. It's going to cost money. Decide which badge you want.
[40:10.140 --> 40:12.740]  The next step here, you guys, once you've got your badge, wait for it.
[40:12.780 --> 40:16.020]  Take a picture. Fucking smile for your picture. Look good in the picture, bro.
[40:16.020 --> 40:16.860]  That's the next step.
[40:17.140 --> 40:19.980]  You don't want to look like a dumb ass and then hang that picture around your
[40:19.980 --> 40:21.060]  neck for the next two years.
[40:21.260 --> 40:24.620]  Where that bright green Colorado medical marijuana enforcement division
[40:24.620 --> 40:29.140]  lanyard cheesy as picture on it. Oh, it's so funny. Walking into places.
[40:29.140 --> 40:32.380]  You still have your original lane. I got the original green one, bro. Yeah.
[40:32.460 --> 40:36.380]  Yeah. Way to be OG buddy. I'm OG. All right. So once you've got that, uh,
[40:36.380 --> 40:39.180]  that picture with your cheesy ass grin on it and you got a badge,
[40:40.140 --> 40:42.860]  the next step is to get a job. Uh,
[40:43.180 --> 40:46.900]  it's once you get the badge now you can apply in the industry. Yeah. Yeah.
[40:46.900 --> 40:49.940]  So think about what you're good at. Are you good at bud tending?
[40:49.940 --> 40:52.500]  Are you good at trimming? Honestly, we keep saying bud tending and trimming.
[40:52.500 --> 40:56.180]  Those are the ways into this industry. Uh, if you want to be a master grower,
[40:56.180 --> 40:58.860]  most places have a master grower. You're going to have to start trimming.
[40:58.860 --> 41:00.660]  You're going to have to show them that you know about plants.
[41:00.660 --> 41:02.700]  One day the master grower is going to go, fuck,
[41:02.700 --> 41:05.620]  I need help transplanting plants. And you're going to go, I'm good at that.
[41:05.620 --> 41:07.220]  And he's going to go, well, come show me what you got.
[41:07.580 --> 41:10.860]  And if you can follow directions and do it the way that he wants it done and
[41:10.860 --> 41:13.820]  also contribute skill, knowledge, and care to the job,
[41:13.980 --> 41:16.060]  you may end up being assistant grower. One day,
[41:16.260 --> 41:18.740]  I may let you come help me pull leaves in the garden. One day,
[41:18.740 --> 41:22.140]  you'll work your way up. And one day when I'm, or not, not me,
[41:22.140 --> 41:23.780]  I don't want to say about the, when the master grower,
[41:23.780 --> 41:26.140]  whatever facility you work at one day when he's sick or whatever,
[41:26.140 --> 41:27.540]  he's got the shits and can't come in.
[41:27.740 --> 41:29.580]  Maybe you get to water the plants or whatever,
[41:29.580 --> 41:31.180]  and you get to learn how to become a master.
[41:31.180 --> 41:34.220]  You're going to work your way up one way or another. Um,
[41:34.340 --> 41:38.700]  Jeff and I were both bud tenders. Like that's where you start.
[41:39.860 --> 41:42.420]  Um, a lot of people start off as trimmers. That's where you start.
[41:42.420 --> 41:45.060]  Like you can be almost anything in the marijuana industry.
[41:45.060 --> 41:47.060]  Like we literally need every profession.
[41:47.180 --> 41:50.620]  I have played bud tender, uh, manager,
[41:51.180 --> 41:55.060]  and by hire and fire were, I did the hiring and firing. Uh,
[41:55.060 --> 42:00.140]  I grew the weed, uh, I'm still doing the growing. I do the,
[42:00.140 --> 42:04.180]  uh, I do some transportation, do a bunch of do all of the, yeah.
[42:04.220 --> 42:06.740]  I used to help with design at different points.
[42:06.740 --> 42:10.380]  I designed a couple of facilities. I designed rooms. Yeah. Yeah.
[42:10.380 --> 42:12.060]  I've done a whole bunch of stuff. So there are a lot of,
[42:12.060 --> 42:14.220]  but it starts off at the bottom. Like people in the,
[42:14.220 --> 42:17.900]  I talk to people every day that aren't prepared for that idea. They're like,
[42:17.900 --> 42:20.940]  well, I've been in marketing for like 10 years and it's like, cool.
[42:21.420 --> 42:24.340]  Are you ready to trim some weed? Like,
[42:24.940 --> 42:27.820]  do you think you could learn everything in this room and what their different
[42:27.820 --> 42:30.020]  applications are for different patients and,
[42:30.660 --> 42:33.700]  and sell it accurately and informed, well-informed, like,
[42:33.700 --> 42:34.660]  can you pull that off?
[42:34.700 --> 42:37.380]  Because if you can't do that or be cool with trimming a little weed,
[42:38.060 --> 42:42.260]  like you're going to have a really hard time looking for dispensary that's
[42:42.300 --> 42:45.860]  actively looking for a marketing dude. Who's never worked in legal weed before.
[42:46.460 --> 42:50.140]  Um, and doesn't necessarily know the community, the culture, the product,
[42:50.940 --> 42:53.340]  the clients, like there's a lot you need to know.
[42:53.340 --> 42:56.260]  And you learn that when you start as a blood tender or a trimmer,
[42:56.300 --> 42:59.180]  it's a whole etiquette. It's a whole world to be involved in.
[42:59.340 --> 43:03.460]  A buddy of mine started as a trimmer and like six weeks later he was running a
[43:03.460 --> 43:06.860]  trim crew for like seven different dispensaries and they just cycled between
[43:06.860 --> 43:08.500]  them as they harvested.
[43:08.620 --> 43:09.620]  Shout out to Linus.
[43:09.660 --> 43:13.820]  Yup. Shout out Linus. Like he had, he struggled for a while,
[43:13.820 --> 43:17.780]  find a dispensary that would even take him on as a trimmer. Um,
[43:17.780 --> 43:21.380]  and when he finally found one, he made sure to put it in his all.
[43:21.420 --> 43:25.180]  And now he's running a big ass crew and a big crew.
[43:25.180 --> 43:28.100]  I see what he's doing on Facebook and he's killing it. His crew is killing it.
[43:28.140 --> 43:30.460]  They're killing it right now. They're doing a great job. Um,
[43:30.500 --> 43:33.140]  I'm the same way you're the same way. Like we moved up quick.
[43:33.380 --> 43:35.180]  Be motivated. If you want to come here and work,
[43:35.540 --> 43:37.860]  this industry is growing so rapidly.
[43:38.260 --> 43:41.300]  We're growing so rapidly and there are so many people coming from around the
[43:41.300 --> 43:46.300]  world to be in this industry that there are 50 people trying to take your job in
[43:46.540 --> 43:48.940]  this industry every fucking day. Uh,
[43:49.100 --> 43:53.060]  green and healthy wellness is a small shop with a small, no, a small location.
[43:53.260 --> 43:55.100]  We aren't very well known yet. We're kind of new.
[43:55.100 --> 43:56.100]  We don't have a large following.
[43:56.100 --> 43:58.420]  I think that's what I'm trying to say with a whole bunch of words.
[43:58.420 --> 43:59.540]  We don't have a huge following,
[43:59.940 --> 44:04.780]  but we get probably five to 10 applications every single day of people that want
[44:04.780 --> 44:08.220]  to be growers, trimmers, bud tenders, whatever they can do.
[44:08.220 --> 44:11.060]  They're like, I will clean the toilets as long as you give me a job in there.
[44:11.540 --> 44:13.060]  Yeah. I see some crazy.
[44:13.060 --> 44:15.980]  I see a lot of people coming in that are doing it right.
[44:15.980 --> 44:20.980]  That are ready to work that know the industry and know how to sell their place
[44:21.340 --> 44:23.020]  in it. Um,
[44:23.220 --> 44:26.140]  and a lot of it comes down to like knowing how to pitch your previous work
[44:26.140 --> 44:30.500]  experience because I sold weed from my living room for the last 10 years.
[44:30.940 --> 44:34.740]  Looks like shit on a resume. Yeah, it does. Um, well, speaking of that,
[44:34.900 --> 44:38.900]  you did a, an episode before that covered like some of the res, uh,
[44:38.940 --> 44:42.660]  resumes you got in the grow and how ridiculous some of them could get put
[44:42.660 --> 44:46.860]  together a real resume. Like if you don't know what that is, Google it. Yeah.
[44:46.980 --> 44:47.820]  Um,
[44:48.220 --> 44:51.460]  be prepared cause there's a lot of people gunning for the jobs that are
[44:51.460 --> 44:55.020]  available. Um, even with this, how fast we're expanding.
[44:55.020 --> 44:57.500]  So if you want to stand out at all, you got to do it right.
[44:58.060 --> 44:58.300]  No,
[44:58.300 --> 45:03.100]  let's talk about some of the problems that come with getting a job working in
[45:03.100 --> 45:07.900]  the cannabis industry. The number one most obvious problem to me is banking.
[45:08.580 --> 45:10.620]  Yep. That's an issue. Um,
[45:10.660 --> 45:15.660]  when you work at a dispensary or as a grower and I can't speak for every shop or
[45:15.860 --> 45:18.900]  every grow, and this is something that I probably shouldn't say too much about,
[45:18.940 --> 45:21.980]  but this is the damn truth. Uh, when payday comes,
[45:22.260 --> 45:25.700]  you get an envelope stuffed with cash.
[45:26.060 --> 45:28.300]  Everything's done in cash. It sucks.
[45:28.500 --> 45:31.980]  Yeah. You get a pay stub and taxes are taken out and that you get a pay stub.
[45:31.980 --> 45:33.060]  Everything else is the same,
[45:33.060 --> 45:38.060]  but instead of a check at the bottom or better yet avoided check that tells you
[45:38.260 --> 45:40.060]  about the direct deposit you just got,
[45:40.700 --> 45:45.020]  you get a check stub folded up with a bunch of twenties in the middle.
[45:45.060 --> 45:46.860]  A bunch of fuck. Yeah.
[45:46.860 --> 45:50.300]  You got to carry all these damn twenties in your backpack or somehow to the car
[45:50.300 --> 45:50.900]  and then home.
[45:50.900 --> 45:54.940]  But it's not just payroll, it's everything like state taxes,
[45:54.940 --> 45:59.340]  federal taxes, electric bills, rent. Like it's, it's, yeah.
[45:59.340 --> 46:00.180]  So when you get home,
[46:00.180 --> 46:03.660]  you got to figure out a way to convert all that cash into some way to pay your
[46:03.660 --> 46:05.420]  rent. So that is the obvious problem.
[46:05.940 --> 46:10.580]  Luckily employees can usually get back accounts. It's smaller banks.
[46:10.580 --> 46:13.700]  No problem. It's the businesses that really can't get accounts,
[46:13.700 --> 46:15.860]  but you've still got to transfer cash to bank.
[46:15.980 --> 46:19.020]  Right, right. You got to end that cash came from a dispensary.
[46:19.500 --> 46:21.180]  So sometimes it stinks like weed,
[46:21.180 --> 46:24.700]  which can trigger your account to get closed if your weed stank too much.
[46:24.820 --> 46:26.100]  If your money stinks too much,
[46:26.140 --> 46:30.180]  we have a mutual friend whose account was just closed because their cash deposit
[46:30.180 --> 46:33.220]  smelled way too much like cannabis. Shout out to that person.
[46:33.220 --> 46:36.860]  Get a second safe y'all. Yeah. Also, one of the problems,
[46:36.860 --> 46:38.780]  we've talked about this a little bit on the podcast.
[46:38.780 --> 46:41.860]  Another problem that can happen if you work in the cannabis industry is you're
[46:41.860 --> 46:44.460]  going to get pulled over and you're going to smell like a pound of fucking weed
[46:44.660 --> 46:47.740]  and the cops are going to harass you. Uh, if you've got a badge,
[46:47.780 --> 46:50.740]  a lot of times they expect you to be a model citizen because you've got the
[46:50.740 --> 46:53.540]  badge and you know the rules. You've got to be a little more careful.
[46:53.540 --> 46:55.460]  We're back to putting your best foot forward.
[46:55.460 --> 46:59.220]  Like don't stink like weed with your badge.
[47:00.220 --> 47:01.820]  And also cause they're good.
[47:01.860 --> 47:05.100]  They're going to as soon as they see that fucker or even the green lanyard that
[47:05.100 --> 47:08.220]  goes with it, they're automatically going to be thinking,
[47:08.220 --> 47:12.260]  is this person high right now behind the wheel? Do I have a DUI arrest?
[47:12.260 --> 47:16.180]  So don't be that person. True. Also renting is hard.
[47:17.220 --> 47:17.860]  Yeah.
[47:17.860 --> 47:20.900]  Getting a house is hard when your place of employment is green and healthy
[47:20.900 --> 47:21.660]  wellness.
[47:21.660 --> 47:25.020]  There's a stigma involved that a lot of people don't realize.
[47:25.020 --> 47:28.500]  I've got a friend leaving the industry right now. Um,
[47:29.780 --> 47:30.620]  and uh,
[47:30.820 --> 47:35.540]  they were talking to me just this afternoon that they're applying for jobs that
[47:35.540 --> 47:37.100]  aren't in the cannabis industry.
[47:37.700 --> 47:42.700]  And he's real hesitant because he hasn't faced a company that drug tests in a
[47:42.940 --> 47:43.780]  decade.
[47:44.900 --> 47:49.900]  He's a bud tender and a cannabis consumer and I'm passionate about cannabis
[47:50.740 --> 47:52.740]  really enjoys that aspect of his life.
[47:53.420 --> 47:57.140]  And at minimum he's going to have to give it up until he can pee clean.
[47:57.860 --> 48:01.620]  And he wasn't necessarily expecting to leave the industry this abruptly.
[48:01.620 --> 48:05.060]  So he's not prepared for that. Um,
[48:05.180 --> 48:09.020]  and so at best his ass is going to be out of work for a while while he looks for
[48:09.020 --> 48:13.180]  your either jobs that don't test, um, or whatnot.
[48:13.180 --> 48:16.260]  But he's extra hesitant because as soon as they're like, well,
[48:16.260 --> 48:18.820]  what'd you just get stopped doing? And he's like, well,
[48:18.820 --> 48:22.500]  I've worked in the marijuana industry for three years and now I'm trying to get
[48:22.500 --> 48:26.740]  a job at a bank or, um, you know, wherever the hell else, the mall.
[48:26.780 --> 48:29.500]  Yeah. Yeah. They're going to, they're going to be judgmental for sure. Right.
[48:29.500 --> 48:33.220]  So like even if they don't typically drug test or there's a lot of companies,
[48:33.260 --> 48:35.980]  I've worked for a bunch of them back in the day that just threatened to drug
[48:35.980 --> 48:37.220]  test. And the, the,
[48:37.220 --> 48:41.740]  the only drug test they do is whether or not you show up to get your cup. Um,
[48:41.780 --> 48:45.380]  they can't actually afford to pay like the 75 bucks or whatever to test you.
[48:45.580 --> 48:46.740]  Yeah. Um,
[48:47.060 --> 48:50.740]  even those companies are more apt to test somebody who's coming out of the legal
[48:50.740 --> 48:54.660]  weed industry. Um, it's just got that stigma to it.
[48:54.660 --> 48:57.540]  So renting, banking, renting cars,
[48:58.700 --> 49:01.420]  renting a car is kind of a bitch. Uh, I was turned down.
[49:01.420 --> 49:04.340]  I just bought a new car. You guys, woo, shout out to my new car.
[49:04.660 --> 49:07.420]  But also shout out to Mario Orch, a letter for the sweet hookup on the new car.
[49:07.740 --> 49:08.540]  But I got a new car.
[49:08.540 --> 49:09.780]  Not having to fix your old car.
[49:09.820 --> 49:11.860]  Yeah, I did that also. And I got two cars,
[49:13.460 --> 49:17.540]  got a winter car and a summer car now. Nice. But, uh, I was declined.
[49:17.540 --> 49:21.260]  I've been getting stacks of envelopes in the mail from credit companies that
[49:21.260 --> 49:25.420]  declined my credit. And when you look at why it says, uh, insufficient employment,
[49:25.660 --> 49:27.980]  and I make a shit ton of money not to brag about my money,
[49:27.980 --> 49:31.020]  but I make plenty of fucking money for the car that I bought. Uh,
[49:31.060 --> 49:33.180]  and they just didn't like it that I worked at a dispensary.
[49:33.180 --> 49:37.060]  They would call me while I was waiting in the Ford dealership to buy my car.
[49:37.060 --> 49:38.460]  They would call and they'd be like, Hey,
[49:38.460 --> 49:40.060]  we've just got one question about your employment.
[49:40.100 --> 49:43.740]  What is this G H W you work at? Cause I just write down GHW,
[49:43.740 --> 49:45.420]  trying to avoid questions. It was like,
[49:45.420 --> 49:47.780]  oh it stands for green and healthy wellness. They're like, Oh,
[49:47.780 --> 49:51.620]  are you a weed grower? And I'd be like, well, yeah, bitch. Why? Oh, we can't,
[49:51.620 --> 49:54.100]  we sorry. We can't, we can't give you credit today. And they just hang up.
[49:55.820 --> 49:59.100]  It's not all companies, but it's several. Yeah. Um,
[49:59.340 --> 50:01.980]  shout out to the companies that don't apply to this,
[50:01.980 --> 50:05.300]  but like there's a stigma that you're going to take on and you kind of have to
[50:05.300 --> 50:08.860]  be ready to bear that cross. And it's not just out in the world.
[50:08.860 --> 50:11.380]  Like plenty of you got family that's like, Oh,
[50:11.380 --> 50:13.700]  fucking cousin Ricky working at the weed store.
[50:14.180 --> 50:18.380]  We should mention all the drug testing talk. The dispensary won't drug test you.
[50:18.740 --> 50:21.060]  Nope. Don't worry. But don't show up high either. Don't be an asshole.
[50:21.780 --> 50:25.340]  If there's too many fucking rules to come toasted, if we can't tell your high,
[50:25.340 --> 50:27.900]  it's okay. If we could tell your high, you're in trouble. Don't be that high.
[50:27.940 --> 50:29.740]  Asshole. Chill out. You're going to get us all in trouble.
[50:30.820 --> 50:32.900]  So the obvious problems,
[50:33.020 --> 50:37.020]  the obvious problems with working in the industry are banking credit, uh,
[50:37.100 --> 50:40.700]  getting a car, getting a loan. That kind of shit is hard. Um,
[50:40.900 --> 50:41.980]  shout out to my friend Jessica.
[50:41.980 --> 50:44.860]  I asked her for guidance on this because she is a manager at a dispensary.
[50:45.100 --> 50:49.940]  She said the first thing she spouted off with the passion was fucking sexism in
[50:49.940 --> 50:51.900]  the cannabis industry. This is,
[50:51.940 --> 50:55.580]  she called it a boys club and said that this is ran by guys and she's a woman.
[50:55.580 --> 50:58.580]  And it's hard to be taken fucking seriously by all the men in this industry.
[50:58.900 --> 51:02.020]  So ladies, uh, when you come to Colorado,
[51:02.300 --> 51:06.500]  your chances of getting a job are nearly tripled of what a guy with the same
[51:06.500 --> 51:10.620]  qualifications are going to have the chances of that same dude are going to have
[51:10.620 --> 51:12.860]  of getting employment. I know that sounds rude to say.
[51:12.900 --> 51:16.420]  They don't care what you'd look like if you're a trimmer for the most part.
[51:16.460 --> 51:18.020]  But if you're a bud tender,
[51:18.140 --> 51:21.940]  automatically hot females go to the top of the stack and that's kind of true in
[51:21.940 --> 51:23.500]  any industry, but it's really true.
[51:23.500 --> 51:26.060]  It's super true in the cannabis industry, unfortunately.
[51:26.060 --> 51:28.860]  So you're going to get hired first at the same time.
[51:29.380 --> 51:33.020]  Everybody's going to look at your titties all fucking day long in the cannabis
[51:33.020 --> 51:35.700]  industry. We are used to growing weed in our basement.
[51:35.740 --> 51:39.100]  We're used to being a bunch of bros. It's kind of a boys club. Uh,
[51:40.140 --> 51:42.820]  we should know this by now, but the grow environment,
[51:42.820 --> 51:44.300]  the weed business environment,
[51:44.300 --> 51:48.620]  sometimes people forget and it gets a little bit a sexist a little bit. So,
[51:48.660 --> 51:53.020]  yeah, the rules that Ness, like kind of apply to every other industry,
[51:53.020 --> 51:57.580]  like we're under so many weed specific rules that in a lot of ways the ball
[51:57.580 --> 51:59.100]  gets dropped with some of the others.
[51:59.500 --> 52:03.100]  So slap us, remind us, be like boys or women in the room,
[52:03.140 --> 52:04.340]  behavior fucking selves.
[52:04.740 --> 52:07.500]  And a guy like myself will check myself after one or two of those.
[52:07.900 --> 52:10.620]  Like me, I don't say some shit when damsels around, shout out damsel.
[52:10.620 --> 52:12.740]  I've learned to respect the ladies a little bit better because I've been
[52:12.740 --> 52:15.260]  reminded. So shout out to the ladies that have taught us that.
[52:15.540 --> 52:17.420]  Uh, there is some sexism in the cannabis industry.
[52:17.740 --> 52:21.420]  Be prepared for that a little bit. Um, another huge problem.
[52:21.420 --> 52:23.780]  You cannot consume on site.
[52:24.180 --> 52:27.220]  If you want to consume cannabis while you're working at a medical marijuana or
[52:27.220 --> 52:31.380]  a recreational marijuana grow facility, processing facility, anything like that,
[52:31.700 --> 52:35.820]  you cannot do it anywhere near the building. You got to go somewhere else.
[52:35.820 --> 52:36.660]  I don't care where you go.
[52:37.820 --> 52:42.140]  The cameras cannot see you. People that are leaving the dispensary should not
[52:43.780 --> 52:47.140]  go far away. Consume your medicine somewhere far away.
[52:47.340 --> 52:50.340]  Safely. That goes for customers too.
[52:50.340 --> 52:52.620]  Like if you're shopping in the legal weed industry,
[52:52.620 --> 52:56.060]  don't try to fucking roll a joint in the parking lot. Yeah. Yeah. Well, okay.
[52:56.260 --> 52:58.220]  Yeah. Don't do that. Get out of there. Uh,
[52:58.220 --> 53:02.300]  also something that I would mention is a pain in the ass in the cannabis
[53:02.300 --> 53:04.860]  industry. And you may think I'm crazy. Some people are going to be like, wham,
[53:04.900 --> 53:09.900]  but there is so much tedious regulation and so much
[53:09.900 --> 53:10.740]  pressure.
[53:11.220 --> 53:15.060]  They were way overboard with the regulation and like, it just,
[53:15.980 --> 53:19.740]  I watch people every day grind up scraps of marijuana,
[53:19.780 --> 53:24.780]  like stems like shit that you wouldn't even consider feeling bad about if you
[53:25.020 --> 53:26.620]  threw away, like it's just trash.
[53:27.220 --> 53:30.740]  They have to grind it with coffee and shredded paper to make it indistinguishable
[53:30.740 --> 53:35.620]  and unusable. Like, and when that you translate that to a major grow,
[53:36.220 --> 53:37.780]  the amount of like,
[53:38.260 --> 53:42.060]  just how you throw out the trash becomes a majorly complicated process.
[53:42.060 --> 53:45.540]  So what we're forced to do, it's ridiculous. I run the, the big grow.
[53:45.540 --> 53:49.940]  We are harvesting 85 lights worth of plants. You make trash lasagna, right?
[53:49.980 --> 53:51.500]  So what we do, uh,
[53:51.500 --> 53:55.100]  I will start a trash can where the tremors are and I'll put,
[53:55.300 --> 53:59.100]  I'll harvest a plant and I will put that pot of dirt in the bottom of the can.
[53:59.140 --> 54:02.020]  Now there's like a little bit of dirt in the bottom. And then as we trim,
[54:02.020 --> 54:04.580]  the leaves and a little bit of sticks will go in and then I'll go harvest
[54:04.580 --> 54:08.540]  another plant or maybe we've got old pots stacked up and I'll pour some of that
[54:09.460 --> 54:12.500]  and it goes dirt, uh, leaves, dirt leaves.
[54:12.500 --> 54:16.380]  And then like I'll sweep up the floor and shit and put the sweepings in there.
[54:16.500 --> 54:20.340]  But you got to mix up that weed. The weed shouldn't be recognizable. Right.
[54:20.380 --> 54:23.460]  And then it has to go into a locked trash can,
[54:23.660 --> 54:26.540]  which is also behind a gate. Yep.
[54:26.660 --> 54:30.820]  They and we still have had our fucking trash broken into torn out of the
[54:30.820 --> 54:31.260]  dumpster.
[54:31.260 --> 54:35.260]  They tear the bags open and they destroy all that and I got to go fucking sweep
[54:35.260 --> 54:38.060]  it up and put the trash back in the goddamn trash can in the morning when I get
[54:38.060 --> 54:42.460]  there. So there are a lot of regulations. The regulations are ridiculous.
[54:42.500 --> 54:46.860]  I have to, uh, everything's gotta be weighed a million times. Everything.
[54:47.020 --> 54:48.980]  And there are checks on things also.
[54:49.260 --> 54:52.940]  So it's a little bit stressful on all the regulation. All the pressure is crazy.
[54:53.420 --> 54:57.580]  Uh, things have to happen at a certain time. Things have to be done quickly.
[54:57.580 --> 55:00.380]  You can't wait for some shit in a big grow. Uh,
[55:00.460 --> 55:02.900]  and you're on camera from 9,000 different angles.
[55:02.900 --> 55:05.420]  So don't ever think you're going to get away with anything.
[55:05.460 --> 55:09.340]  The being on camera on every square inch takes some adjusting.
[55:09.340 --> 55:11.980]  Like I watch it all day at work. People forget they're on camera.
[55:12.660 --> 55:14.980]  Or I pointed out to customers, like we're on camera.
[55:15.140 --> 55:18.700]  Like we can see and hear everything. Stop it. Hear everything.
[55:18.700 --> 55:20.620]  Like you're trying to get us in trouble. Like why?
[55:20.660 --> 55:24.380]  Stop fucking asking how to take weed to Texas. Like we can't answer you. Right?
[55:24.420 --> 55:27.540]  Yeah. Stop asking how many pieces of edibles you should eat.
[55:27.580 --> 55:30.300]  It's fucking one and wait two hours, bitch. I told you twice.
[55:30.340 --> 55:34.340]  It gets stressful. And also the rules always fucking change.
[55:34.340 --> 55:36.900]  I get emails once a week with new rules.
[55:37.260 --> 55:37.860]  New rules.
[55:37.860 --> 55:41.580]  There's a special company that makes law books and they're on their like third
[55:41.580 --> 55:43.580]  marijuana book now. Wow.
[55:43.620 --> 55:46.780]  Like you have to buy the original book and then the two addendum books.
[55:47.060 --> 55:49.620]  So that's a, that's most of what I've got. That's stressful.
[55:49.620 --> 55:53.740]  But one thing that might can testify to cause he's a bud tender mostly.
[55:54.140 --> 55:54.420]  Uh,
[55:54.420 --> 55:58.620]  now the consumer is so educated that they expect a bud and,
[55:58.820 --> 56:00.580]  and fo educated.
[56:00.580 --> 56:03.020]  They think they know what the fuck they're talking about that they expect to.
[56:03.220 --> 56:07.900]  I hear the phrase sad of a lot and I hear Indigo even more. Oh wow.
[56:07.940 --> 56:10.660]  Um, it's, it's a good and a bad thing.
[56:10.700 --> 56:14.740]  I guess I'm blessed to be in the, uh, the medical side of things now.
[56:14.940 --> 56:18.820]  I get a lot of that too, but honestly, um, I, I see kind of a tourist,
[56:18.860 --> 56:20.940]  a more touristy side of it. And honestly,
[56:20.940 --> 56:24.980]  they just haven't had the culture and the community out loud and proud.
[56:24.980 --> 56:29.460]  Like we have here in Colorado, like down in Texas and in Arkansas for this long.
[56:29.500 --> 56:33.660]  But like, um, you can really tell who,
[56:34.060 --> 56:36.900]  who's been in the community actively and who hasn't,
[56:37.380 --> 56:40.540]  who's been like a marijuana consumer in the total shadows.
[56:40.540 --> 56:42.300]  Like most of their friends don't know.
[56:42.820 --> 56:46.180]  They definitely wouldn't talk about it in public or on the news or on the radio.
[56:46.780 --> 56:50.260]  Um, so they've never heard anyone say sativa before or Indica.
[56:50.700 --> 56:52.820]  It's just never happened. They've only ever read it.
[56:53.460 --> 56:56.180]  And just thinking about that kind of boggles my mind a little bit.
[56:56.180 --> 56:58.260]  So I try to pity them a little bit, but it fucking,
[56:58.260 --> 57:00.340]  when I hear it for like the 14th time on a Saturday,
[57:00.340 --> 57:03.380]  it makes me want to fucking cock punch somebody. Um,
[57:04.860 --> 57:08.580]  but, uh, I saw the same thing in the wine world. Like,
[57:08.580 --> 57:10.020]  so it exists other places.
[57:10.020 --> 57:13.460]  People think they know a lot and they act snotty and it's funny.
[57:14.300 --> 57:17.540]  I love the dispensary where the butt tender knows fucking everything.
[57:17.540 --> 57:19.940]  It makes you feel stupid and doesn't realize that I'm a breeder.
[57:20.500 --> 57:23.180]  Right? Like I love it when they're wrong.
[57:23.220 --> 57:27.140]  I was in a shop the other day in Denver and I heard wrong information.
[57:27.140 --> 57:28.540]  There was a strain labeled wrong.
[57:28.540 --> 57:31.740]  And I listened to the bud tender go on for like four minutes about how it was an
[57:31.740 --> 57:34.180]  Indica when it's a really popular sativa.
[57:34.180 --> 57:37.060]  And I'm just sitting there shaking my head as the customer gobbles it up.
[57:37.820 --> 57:40.860]  And I'm like, dude, look at the buds. Like I can tell that's a fucking city.
[57:41.500 --> 57:46.100]  The buds are growing. Damn it. Stupid professional weed smokers. All right,
[57:46.340 --> 57:47.700]  Mike, thanks for coming to the show, bro.
[57:48.140 --> 57:49.980]  Happy to man. Um, you guys,
[57:49.980 --> 57:53.260]  that's all we've got for how to get your badge here in the state of Colorado.
[57:53.260 --> 57:56.700]  How to get your badge and some of the things that come along with that
[57:56.700 --> 57:59.060]  particular key to awesomeness.
[57:59.100 --> 58:02.660]  Yeah. Shout out once again to that one mountain girl and also a huge shout out
[58:02.660 --> 58:07.300]  to Jessica. Both were a huge contributors to the show. Also shout out to the,
[58:07.300 --> 58:08.580]  uh, CD,
[58:08.580 --> 58:11.340]  the Colorado department of public health and environment website for all the
[58:11.340 --> 58:13.380]  information they gave me. Uh,
[58:13.660 --> 58:16.340]  I want to give a huge shout out to, um,
[58:16.500 --> 58:19.220]  everybody who wished me a happy birthday. If it was on Facebook,
[58:19.220 --> 58:22.580]  if it was on Instagram, if it was on Twitter, if it was here face to face,
[58:22.580 --> 58:26.620]  if it was a through text message, however it was, thanks. I had a great birthday.
[58:26.860 --> 58:29.820]  The whole week has been amazing. We're still raging. Uh,
[58:29.900 --> 58:32.380]  it is been several days since my birthday.
[58:32.380 --> 58:36.780]  It's actually the fourth now and my birthday was on the first and I have finally
[58:36.780 --> 58:40.100]  eaten all of the food and snacks that I was given on my birthday.
[58:40.380 --> 58:44.500]  I however have not consumed all of the Chipotle gift cards that I was given.
[58:45.020 --> 58:48.020]  Yeah. Somebody gave me a Chipotle gift card. So I got that on deck.
[58:48.020 --> 58:50.900]  Maybe that'll be my, uh, my after work treat tomorrow.
[58:51.660 --> 58:55.100]  I just went to check my phone to see if Chipotle was still possible. Oh,
[58:55.620 --> 58:59.820]  not at all, bro. It's kind of late for Chipotle. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,
[58:59.820 --> 59:02.660]  so big thanks to everybody that hooked me up for my birthday. If you fed me,
[59:02.660 --> 59:04.940]  if you took me out, if you dad me out, uh,
[59:04.940 --> 59:08.900]  if you gave me some solvent less hash that I pressed into one giant fucking dad,
[59:08.900 --> 59:12.060]  big shout out. If you dab me out with sphere X, big shout out.
[59:12.340 --> 59:14.420]  Also big shout out to my friends at the Cana Canyon.
[59:14.740 --> 59:17.780]  I dropped into the Cana Canyon yesterday and hung out. Uh,
[59:18.020 --> 59:21.020]  everybody in there, dad, me out. Everybody in there was happy to see me.
[59:21.020 --> 59:22.420]  Big shout out to the Cana Canyon.
[59:22.420 --> 59:25.340]  If you're ever in Colorado Springs and you need a place to stop and kill a few
[59:25.340 --> 59:28.780]  minutes, you want to smoke down. I always recommend the Cana Canyon.
[59:29.020 --> 59:33.820]  It's on Colorado Boulevard, Colorado Avenue. It's on Colorado.
[59:34.260 --> 59:37.340]  It's not hard to find. If you Google the Cana Canyon in Colorado Springs,
[59:37.340 --> 59:39.820]  you will get there. Tell Camille that Rasta Jeff sent you,
[59:40.060 --> 59:41.820]  that you listened to the grow from the heart podcast.
[59:41.860 --> 59:44.860]  She will treat you like royalty. Uh,
[59:44.860 --> 59:46.660]  that's what I think I've got for you this week. You guys,
[59:46.780 --> 59:48.140]  I do have more episodes planned.
[59:48.140 --> 59:50.940]  I'm going to do an episode with a bunch of lovely ladies and we'll talk about
[59:50.940 --> 59:55.180]  women and cannabis. Um, what else do we have? Anyway,
[59:55.220 --> 59:56.340]  it'll be in the future. Anyway,
[59:56.340 --> 59:57.740]  we don't have to talk too much about what's coming up.
[59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.060]  My little notebook is over there. I'm not going to reach for it. Mike,
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.140]  I want to thank you for hanging out, dude.
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.700]  You had to leave the little guy at home.
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.500]  I hope you didn't miss him too much while you're here.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.900]  I'll let you get back to him real soon.
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.460]  Yeah, it was about that time, but it's good to be here, man.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.660]  I heard an episode a little while back.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:14.460]  Someone mentioned missing me on the shows. Dude, I'm trying to be here, man.
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:18.300]  It's a life got crazy, but this is still a important to me.
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:20.340]  And I want to be here as often as I can,
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.420]  but that's not as often as I would like right now.
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:26.500]  So I apologize for my absence and I hope you like me on the show lately.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.660]  That was our buddy. Mike O was his name.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.820]  Yep. I thought it was Mike O. He sent a couple of emails, which I like,
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.620]  I like repeated updates.
[01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:36.100]  Yeah. Well he was a little pissed off that you hadn't been here for a little
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.540]  while. He was kind of upset with the show.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:42.500]  Life exploded and the show had to take a back burner for a while for a,
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.980]  for a minute there. It was a,
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:47.780]  it was a big part of my extracurricular activities and I just sort of that time
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.900]  got filled big time.
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.500]  Yeah, man. I don't blame you at all.
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:53.100]  That kid is the most important thing in your world as it should be.
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.980]  Nope. But yeah, the show is still a priority. So, uh,
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.500]  we're recording real late at night. Like we said, Chipotle be fucking close.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:03.860]  That sucks. Um, so yeah, we're, we're scratching it out, but, uh,
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.380]  I wanted to be part of the show. Getting a badge is like,
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:10.140]  I've seen so many people fucked because they didn't know this information before
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:13.820]  they made a big leap. Um, and uh,
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:16.540]  I want to really want her to be a part of this show. So yeah,
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.180]  sorry for the ramblings. Hope you got the information you need.
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.820]  Because knowing is half the battle.
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.500]  Knowing is fucking half the battle people.
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.980]  All right, you guys, I want to thank everybody for listening.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.180]  Thanks again to Mike for coming.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:27.580]  I will be back in seven days with another episode.
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.660]  I'm not sure what I'm going to put out for you in seven days.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:33.220]  I've got a lot of stuff written down. Uh, it'll be great. I promise you that.
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:34.380]  Make sure you tune in.
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:37.700]  Make sure you check out the show on iTunes, Stitcher or iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:41.820]  We do not have any sponsors on this episode.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.940]  If you want to sponsor the podcast or if you've got a product you'd like me to
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.700]  review, send me an email. It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:50.380]  I want to give a big shout out to a product called Spherix.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:54.820]  I was able to dab this new Earl called Spherix last night at the Canyon Canyon.
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.180]  I only took one dab of it so far. It's got my fucking attention.
