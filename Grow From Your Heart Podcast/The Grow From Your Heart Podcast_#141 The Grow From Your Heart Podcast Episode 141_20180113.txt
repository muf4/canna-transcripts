[01:43.310 --> 01:45.950]  almost revealed the location. I probably shouldn't do that. We were at a secret
[01:45.950 --> 01:49.670]  location in a lovely basement smoking out. We got the windows open and a lovely
[01:49.910 --> 01:54.870]  Colorado summer evening. Joining me is my new friend, Quinton. Dude, thanks a lot
[01:54.870 --> 01:58.390]  for fixing my SD card so that we can record a podcast tonight. Yeah, no problem.

[02:30.550 --> 02:37.310]  Basement? It's the hangout. It's like the dry and cure spot. For right now. We got the bugs drying over there. They smell delicious. As soon as I
[02:37.310 --> 02:40.790]  walked down here, I was like, ooh, fresh flowers. Good job on whoever did that.
[02:40.790 --> 02:44.550]  That was John. John, welcome to the show, bro. Hey, how's it going? Hey, guys, follow Steve

[03:05.590 --> 03:09.910]  pictures and some other info on there. He tries to be modest. I just have some
[03:09.910 --> 03:14.310]  bud pictures on there. Truly living or true living organic. Truly living. Truly

[03:17.350 --> 03:22.230]  Follow all my all my friends here. So, uh, Steve actually invited me here to do
[03:22.230 --> 03:26.230]  this podcast. Steve, you guys probably remember if you listen to the show, he is
[03:26.230 --> 03:31.670]  the founder, president, chair dude, main veteran of the Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[03:32.390 --> 03:35.830]  For my listeners that haven't been following, uh, will you give us a little
[03:35.830 --> 03:39.830]  description of what the VFA does? Yeah, basically, I hold events for vets,
[03:39.830 --> 03:46.070]  bring them out of isolation. We give them $100 in cash and prizes. We feed
[03:46.070 --> 03:51.910]  them. We give them medicated cookies, medicated barbecue ribs, chicken. Uh,
[03:51.910 --> 03:56.950]  we're eventually going to move to live music, but we give away genetics, soil,
[03:56.950 --> 04:01.670]  nutrients, just grow gear, everything. So you basically hold big parties at
[04:01.670 --> 04:05.670]  cannabis friendly venues and invite veterans that are in need, get them out
[04:05.670 --> 04:09.030]  of their house and put a smile on their face. Absolutely. Instead of ignoring
[04:09.030 --> 04:12.870]  them, like a lot of society has chosen to do. Right. And, and the way it works
[04:12.870 --> 04:19.430]  is I get companies and other organizations involved and they make a donation to
[04:19.430 --> 04:26.390]  where it's, it's what they provide as, as, um, a product to the industry. Right.
[04:26.390 --> 04:29.990]  And so they give it away and basically, you know, we're going to probably have
[04:29.990 --> 04:35.350]  around $40,000 in genetics to give away. I mean, it's, it's serious. That's
[04:35.350 --> 04:38.550]  amazing. Uh, do you want to list off some of the people that are helping out with
[04:38.550 --> 04:42.390]  that event? Yes. Let me pull it up real quick. We'll take your time. And dude,
[04:42.390 --> 04:45.910]  thank you for doing what you do for the veterans. And also for being a veteran,
[04:45.910 --> 04:50.710]  Steve is a veteran, which is what inspired him to be so proactive for his fellows.
[04:50.710 --> 04:54.230]  I'm sure we've talked about it on the show, but, uh, Steve's got a hole in his
[04:54.230 --> 04:59.990]  back from taking, uh, an IED, right? EFP. EFP. Right. I'll learn all these terms.
[04:59.990 --> 05:05.030]  There's so many, uh, military. Yeah. Technically he got blowed the fuck up.
[05:05.030 --> 05:09.430]  He's got a hole in his back about kidney height. That is seriously. I could, you
[05:09.430 --> 05:13.510]  could hide a baseball in there. You could smuggle a baseball in that hole. Put Wilson in there.
[05:14.950 --> 05:19.670]  Always have a friend, bro. I love that. You've got a good positive attitude about it now.
[05:19.670 --> 05:23.430]  Right. I'm pretty sure that took him. It took about seven and a half years to,
[05:23.430 --> 05:29.190]  to really pull out of it. Lots of therapy. Um, and then, uh, you know, just lots of good cannabis
[05:29.190 --> 05:34.230]  helps as well. Lots of good friends. Absolutely. Lots of good, just a good support system is what
[05:34.230 --> 05:39.910]  was really important for my recovery. I'm a proud of you, bro. Not to sound like a cheesy bro,
[05:39.910 --> 05:43.990]  but it's fucking awesome. A lot of people get blowed the fuck up and go the opposite way. And
[05:43.990 --> 05:47.990]  that's who you're trying to help. So yeah, man, everybody, let's, let's get to the sponsors.
[05:47.990 --> 05:51.190]  Yeah, definitely. So, so yeah, let's see here. First off,

[07:13.430 --> 07:17.430]  So you're the dab lounge, which is holding the venue. Shout out to the dab. Yeah. Dan's a good
[07:17.430 --> 07:22.790]  guy. Let's see here. We got dry stiff, Colorado Glenn. He's going to be doing like a dry sift,
[07:22.790 --> 07:28.790]  a presentation. And he'll probably give one or two kits away as well. We got tiger stripe seed
[07:28.790 --> 07:33.910]  company. New guys are new to me. Sorry. I don't know how new they are new to me. And then we got,
[07:33.910 --> 07:37.590]  you know, our company, which is Colorado veterans collective. That's something we're going to talk
[07:37.590 --> 07:43.190]  a whole bunch about here pretty soon. And then we got Danny gangster seeds. And then we got Jim
[07:43.270 --> 07:47.990]  blue. She from blues brothers, blues brothers. What's up, Jim. Then we got nectar for the guides,
[07:47.990 --> 07:52.470]  which is sponsoring all the soil and nutrients. Uh, you shared some cannabis that you grew with
[07:52.470 --> 07:58.150]  nectar of the gods. And, uh, I'll agree that was Godlike. It's pretty good. And it was that sunset
[07:58.150 --> 08:02.630]  sherbet you gave me. Yep. Sunset sherbet. And then we smoked heart of gold and then something
[08:02.630 --> 08:06.470]  else. Of course. Good job on the heart of gold, even growing the shit out of that one for a
[08:06.470 --> 08:09.670]  minute. And of course that's my genetics. So I always love tasting it and seeing what happens
[08:09.670 --> 08:13.990]  with that. But that sunset, uh, I, I enjoyed that more than the heart of gold to tell you the truth.
[08:13.990 --> 08:19.830]  The flavor on that was so bold. Thanks, man. I was, I described it in my head as, uh, if you take
[08:19.830 --> 08:24.550]  a purple, laugh and hold it in your mouth for a couple of minutes and let it start to melt. That's,
[08:24.550 --> 08:28.390]  I think that's kind of what that would taste like. So good work on that, bro. I really appreciate it.
[08:28.390 --> 08:33.670]  I just love to grow cannabis. It's just my favorite thing in the world. I wish you could
[08:33.670 --> 08:37.750]  see Steve's face right now. Cause he just lit up like a little kid. It's like someone just showed
[08:37.830 --> 08:45.910]  him boobs. He's got a huge smile. You're in my face all day. I'm happy about it.
[08:47.030 --> 08:50.630]  When is this a veteran farmers Alliance event happening? It's going to be Friday,
[08:50.630 --> 08:54.710]  November 11th on veterans day. Perfect. He couldn't do any better than that. Friday,
[08:54.710 --> 08:58.550]  November 11th veterans day at the dab lounge, right? That's correct. In Colorado Springs.
[08:58.550 --> 09:03.270]  What's the address there? Do you remember? It's 1532 North circle. I believe. Good job. That
[09:03.270 --> 09:09.350]  sounds accurate to me. I would say that's right. Are non veterans invited as well as veterans?
[09:09.350 --> 09:15.830]  Yes, but it is $50 to get in. And what that does is that goes to the donation for my five Oh one
[09:16.710 --> 09:22.070]  to basically get the application, get the bylaws written, get it rolling and going. And then,
[09:22.630 --> 09:28.310]  and then, yeah, then I can actually do a whole lot more, which is going to be the next three to five
[09:28.310 --> 09:31.590]  years is going to be something really crazy. We've got a plan. We're going to talk about that in a
[09:31.590 --> 09:35.270]  minute, I think. Absolutely. So the veteran farmers Alliance event at the dab lounge, make
[09:35.270 --> 09:39.590]  sure you guys come. He said it's $50. Don't be scared. You heard of all of those companies that
[09:39.590 --> 09:45.110]  donated products are the non veterans that show up and pay the $50 entry fee eligible for those
[09:45.110 --> 09:51.670]  raffles. Yes. Yes. You guys, I won two prizes last time. I won a jar of weed. And then my second
[09:51.670 --> 09:56.230]  prize was a grinder. So you can't go any better than that. Right? Yeah. You walk in and win
[09:56.230 --> 10:00.310]  something. You're happy. I got blazed out of my mind. I had a hood. I got a hoodie from our friend
[10:00.390 --> 10:06.710]  Fox. Yeah. Okay. I got a whole bunch of great things. Uh, it was a good time. All right. So
[10:06.710 --> 10:11.030]  you mentioned trying to raise money. The contributions will go to raise money for
[10:11.030 --> 10:18.390]  your new five Oh one K C uh, three C five. Okay. Five C three or three C. I forget how it goes.
[10:18.390 --> 10:23.670]  I don't, it's just, it's been crazy. I got so much going on. It's like, now I got to get this.
[10:23.670 --> 10:29.430]  And I'm like, it's a what, what the internet will help you out. Oh yeah. There's gotta be,
[10:29.750 --> 10:33.990]  what's that? What's that? Legal zoom. Go to legal zoom. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was looking at.
[10:33.990 --> 10:38.230]  It's probably going to be about, I think anywhere from a thousand to 1100. And then I got to
[10:38.230 --> 10:43.750]  go to score and then they'll do all the, help me with the bylaws. And once that's going, then I
[10:43.750 --> 10:47.270]  just want it to all be legit for everybody. There's a cap. Nobody will make hundreds of
[10:47.270 --> 10:52.790]  thousands of dollars. It'll be like 22 grand top everybody. Like that's all the rest of the
[10:52.790 --> 10:59.430]  donations. I mean, that's once we're having, we have to establish people to hire on to travel
[10:59.430 --> 11:04.310]  around and, and help put these events on. Cause we want to, instead of doing two a year, we want
[11:04.310 --> 11:08.950]  to do one every month. So, Oh wow. And different locations to get more veterans and more cities,
[11:08.950 --> 11:13.990]  more supplies to grow their own cannabis. So eventually we're going to, if we take in,
[11:13.990 --> 11:19.270]  once we start taking in a large amount and it's like, well, I need to start hiring people to
[11:19.270 --> 11:25.510]  start expanding, then their cap is 22 grand, not 800 grand. Okay. Keep it modest for people.
[11:25.510 --> 11:29.670]  I like, yeah. It's like, if you're here to do it for the veteran farmers Alliance or for the other
[11:29.670 --> 11:34.390]  organization, just for veteran farmers Alliance. Okay. And, and the whole point is if you're
[11:34.390 --> 11:39.270]  coming to work, like even me, if I, if I don't even know if I'm going to even take the money,
[11:39.270 --> 11:46.870]  but the whole point is it's, it's guys that need something to do. It's we take them out.
[11:46.870 --> 11:51.670]  We take that donation instead of putting in our pocket, right? The whole nonprofit,
[11:53.110 --> 11:56.390]  what we do is we'll take that. We'll take him out on like fishing trips, hunting trips.
[11:57.350 --> 12:01.190]  We'll take him out on backpacking tricks trips. We'll take them down to Peru.
[12:01.190 --> 12:05.190]  And that's more therapeutic than any kind of hospital visit or psychology,
[12:05.190 --> 12:08.230]  or having a friend to go hang out and smoke some herbs. And I mean,
[12:08.230 --> 12:10.230]  on a camping trip, eventually you'll have your camp too.
[12:10.230 --> 12:13.830]  Healing. Right. And eventually we're going to get acreage where we can just do this.
[12:13.830 --> 12:19.910]  Guys can come out for a week and just reset hunt, fish camp, veteran farmers Alliance camping trip.
[12:19.910 --> 12:24.150]  That sounds great, but it's on our own land. So it'll be private land. You can come out and just
[12:24.150 --> 12:29.110]  relax, just decompress. Some guys need that. They just need a reset, you know, a little quiet space
[12:29.110 --> 12:32.550]  away from the fireworks. Absolutely. This episode will come out right before the 4th of July. You
[12:32.550 --> 12:36.310]  guys respect the veterans on the 4th of July. If you know that somebody that lives next door
[12:36.310 --> 12:41.910]  or on your block is a combat veteran, go ask them if they're cool with fireworks. And if they're not,
[12:41.910 --> 12:45.750]  don't light them, go somewhere else and watch the show. Like don't, don't freak people out. I've
[12:45.750 --> 12:50.710]  seen, I see a lot of stuff on Facebook about it. Please respect the veterans. I do not agree with
[12:50.710 --> 12:55.430]  war, but these are humans. Uh, you got to respect them either way. And believe it or not, that
[12:55.430 --> 12:59.990]  shit sounds exactly like it from a distance. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Definitely. I mean, even up close,
[12:59.990 --> 13:03.990]  I mean, it's just, there was last year was the first year I ever went to the 4th of July in eight
[13:03.990 --> 13:10.790]  years. And it was, yeah, it was like, I was like, man, okay, I can do this. And that just reminded
[13:10.790 --> 13:14.550]  me a lot. I was like, all right, yeah, that sounds like it, but I know it's not real. Right.
[13:14.550 --> 13:18.550]  And I'm just, my wife's asking me every time and see, okay, you okay? I'm like, yeah, I'm good.
[13:19.110 --> 13:23.990]  I'm like, I think I'll be all right. And that was kind of the last year about this time is when I
[13:23.990 --> 13:28.950]  first started taking the steps to recovering and uh, yeah, it's been a quick process ever since
[13:28.950 --> 13:33.750]  then too. So I've known you basically through the whole come through process. Right. Wow. I didn't
[13:33.750 --> 13:40.950]  realize you were that new or new freshly out of your, uh, your, I don't know, your trauma,
[13:40.950 --> 13:44.710]  right? I don't know the word for it, but you know what? I just got tired of it. I got tired of being
[13:44.710 --> 13:48.630]  in my head all the time. I got tired of isolating. I got tired of being this fucking asshole all the
[13:48.630 --> 13:54.070]  time. And it just got to the point where it was like, fuck, I gotta just do something about this.
[13:54.630 --> 13:58.310]  And my wife was going to leave me. I was going to lose my house. I was like, I can't do this.
[13:58.950 --> 14:04.390]  So I just said, fuck it. I'm not going to be trapped in my head anymore. And we found a good
[14:04.390 --> 14:10.470]  therapist, started doing EMDR and I started using cannabis with, I don't know what it's called.
[14:11.350 --> 14:16.310]  We had to look it up the other day on Tok radio too. I bet Jay knows we should message Jay.
[14:16.310 --> 14:21.190]  That's our friend Jay Daly at a Tok radio.com. You guys, you can hear this podcast every Wednesday
[14:21.190 --> 14:27.270]  at 1 PM on Tok radio. Yeah. Those are some cool guys up there. Yeah. I guess a great guy on his
[14:27.270 --> 14:31.590]  show in his studio yet, but he runs my show on his network. So that is super friendly. I need to
[14:31.590 --> 14:34.790]  go hang out with Jay. Jay, if you're listening, invite me up. I'd love to be on your show.
[14:34.790 --> 14:39.030]  I'd like to come and do your show and Lucy's show on the same day in one trip to Denver.
[14:39.030 --> 14:43.910]  That'd be awesome. Yeah. Jay's a good guy. Really cool guy. I liked hanging out with him at events,
[14:43.910 --> 14:51.190]  giving him dabs. Man, he said, dude, this hash on the table, that hash over there, Jay said that
[14:51.190 --> 14:56.550]  this was the best hash he's ever dabbed. Ever. Who grew the product? That was me. You grew it.
[14:56.550 --> 15:00.390]  Who ran the extraction? If you don't do the extraction, good work, man. I took a dab of it.
[15:01.590 --> 15:06.310]  Do you wax? No grin. It's beautiful. I, I, unfortunately I can't give you best I've ever
[15:06.310 --> 15:13.990]  smoked. I can remember one of my favorites. The very first secret cup in Denver, entry number 23,
[15:13.990 --> 15:23.030]  Kyle, Kyle Cushman's veganic strawberry cough. Best dabs I've ever, ever, but shout out for
[15:23.030 --> 15:29.350]  Jay saying that this was the best. I still had that strain. Yeah. Everybody wants that old Kyle
[15:29.350 --> 15:35.190]  Cushman cut. Yeah. He's, he's very, very talented. I, I hope one day I can be at that level. Kyle.
[15:35.190 --> 15:38.790]  Yeah. You're you're there, bro. Am I? You're on your way. If you're not there, you're on your way.
[15:38.790 --> 15:42.310]  Oh, you know, I still, I think I've got a few more years under my belt. He presents it differently,
[15:42.310 --> 15:46.390]  but I'm sure you've got all that in your head. I just, well, you know, combining our knowledge,
[15:46.390 --> 15:49.910]  John's knowledge with mine, I think we're going to do some pretty cool stuff. Oh yeah. Yeah. I've
[15:49.910 --> 15:53.990]  smoked a bunch of hash that this guy's that John has made and it is always quality. Thank you. I
[15:53.990 --> 15:59.030]  always like somebody who enjoys my products. I smoke a lot of hash. I've seen some boo-boo
[16:01.030 --> 16:06.310]  yeah. I've noticed I like to take like half gram, gram dabs or so I try not to do it too much when
[16:06.310 --> 16:11.430]  I'm at people's houses and in public, I just try to behave myself. Yeah. That definitely alters
[16:11.430 --> 16:16.470]  person's mind a little bit. Half gram. I really like to go to the candy Canyon or somewhere where
[16:16.470 --> 16:20.950]  there's a bunch of people and just walk in after work and just drop a half gram dab on the email
[16:20.950 --> 16:26.390]  and people look at you like, but are you okay? I just got off work. What's wrong? Like you didn't
[16:26.390 --> 16:32.710]  even cough. And I'm like, why would I cough? I just took a dab. I do this all day. Come on guys.
[16:32.710 --> 16:37.590]  Just got off work. Don't you take a fat dab after work? I smoke a big fat joint. Well, I don't work,
[16:37.590 --> 16:43.670]  but you work all day and you take care of veterans and some maybe keeping your own head straight.
[16:43.670 --> 16:47.030]  Sometimes there's plenty of work for you. Sometimes it's video games too, though.
[16:48.070 --> 16:52.790]  As a combat veteran with PTSD, can you play combat style? Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[16:54.310 --> 17:00.070]  Now, like my wife or kid came, I'm like, go away. And they're kind of like, dude, don't be a dick.
[17:00.070 --> 17:03.670]  And I'm kind of like, yeah, you're right. And I get off and I'm just like, that's the only,
[17:03.670 --> 17:07.830]  that's the only thing it does to me, but warrior mode, right. You know, it kind of like puts you
[17:07.830 --> 17:11.030]  back into the mindset. It's like, are you getting this? And you're like, kill a motherfucker.
[17:11.990 --> 17:16.710]  And it's just, uh, it's a lot of fun. Are you really good? I'm okay. I'm okay. Uh,
[17:17.510 --> 17:23.830]  I play BF three on my PC. So it's not bad. I'm not much of a gamer. I had an issue with video
[17:23.830 --> 17:29.030]  games. I had to give them up completely. Yeah. Uh, well when Sims was popular, I would show up
[17:29.030 --> 17:32.390]  at work and my friends would be like, did you stay up all night playing the Sims? And I'd be like,
[17:32.390 --> 17:37.430]  yes, you care more about your Sims than you do you. And that's when I was like,
[17:38.390 --> 17:42.790]  you're right. You're completely right right now. And I have to check this problem. So,
[17:42.790 --> 17:47.670]  uh, the next time I moved, I got rid of all my gaming consoles and I try really hard not to put
[17:47.670 --> 17:52.790]  games in my new computer. It gets addicting. I just replaced it with Instagram, Facebook,
[17:52.790 --> 18:03.030]  Tinder, uh, Twitter, uh, mass roots, uh, tumbler flicker. Yeah. I don't need to became a little
[18:03.030 --> 18:08.870]  more proactive. Yeah. Just switch out all of these, get you somewhere. Kinda. Yeah. Is that
[18:08.870 --> 18:14.310]  real? Like, sure. I have a bunch of likes, I guess I can't hold them or do anything with them. And I
[18:14.310 --> 18:18.150]  doubt like out of the, however many thousand people that follow me, I like six of them would
[18:18.150 --> 18:23.750]  come to my funeral. Right. I guess that's a good point. Huh? Well, social media, man, it's a weird
[18:23.750 --> 18:29.110]  thing. Well, it's like, I used to take all my time and dedicate an Instagram and it was just, it's,
[18:29.110 --> 18:33.270]  it's like a one way it felt like for me. Right. It's like you post and you didn't really get a
[18:33.270 --> 18:37.590]  whole lot of feedback. Like you could ask a question and get a whole lot back. So I moved
[18:37.590 --> 18:42.470]  over to Facebook and social media was very awesome. Uh, and very accepting over there.
[18:42.470 --> 18:48.070]  And it has been a blast meeting and just getting to know a lot of just really interesting. That's
[18:48.070 --> 18:53.510]  how we became friends. Yeah. I mean you, uh, I've been able to talk to him and there's too many
[18:53.590 --> 18:57.030]  people to name off. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.
[18:57.030 --> 19:01.990]  It can be on the podcast. You guys might hear, you might hear some dogs in the background guys.
[19:02.710 --> 19:06.230]  They're very friendly. I met them at the door. I mean, I talked to him a lot on,
[19:06.230 --> 19:10.950]  on social media, Scott Ostrander that owns nectar for the gods. Okay. He's just, he's
[19:10.950 --> 19:15.110]  awesome to talk to. There's just so many good people and on Facebook and yeah, there's a lot
[19:15.110 --> 19:19.270]  of drama too, but you can see that's what the follow buttons for, right. Or the block button
[19:19.270 --> 19:23.030]  or the block button. Yeah. I'm strong with the floor. Good to meet you.
[19:23.510 --> 19:30.150]  Hi doggy with the red, golden green collar. Say hello. Dog is shy. Dog's name is Ziggy.
[19:30.950 --> 19:31.750]  People with beards.
[19:34.550 --> 19:37.830]  So we were kind of in the middle of talking about the VFA and the upcoming event, helping
[19:37.830 --> 19:41.430]  veterans. I'm not exactly sure where we jumped off the deep end on this one, but we got on a
[19:41.430 --> 19:45.750]  pothead rant. Oh yeah. That's all good. We use a hashtag on the podcast. That's hashtag. They
[19:45.750 --> 19:50.070]  like it when we ramble. So they know what to expect when they listen to this show.
[19:50.710 --> 19:56.390]  Well, I'm pretty sure we, we basically wrapped up the VFA. All right. So now we're going to have
[19:56.390 --> 20:00.710]  a camp for these veterans to go hang out and Medicaid and get away. We jumped off on fireworks
[20:00.710 --> 20:05.110]  is how I got on. So you've got a place for the veterans to go get away and be away from everything
[20:05.110 --> 20:09.430]  and Medicaid properly and hang out with other veterans and vent and be cool. And the cannabis
[20:09.430 --> 20:14.950]  is free. Everything's free. Very cool. Everything, everything, everything. Is there a limited number
[20:14.950 --> 20:18.710]  of seats or how are you going to keep that? I don't know yet. We smell, we got to get there
[20:18.710 --> 20:24.230]  first logistics. Yeah. Long-term plan. I think once we get two years in what we're doing now,
[20:24.230 --> 20:28.390]  when we have the funds to really start looking, I think that's when we'll start sitting down and
[20:28.390 --> 20:32.870]  really put shit on paper. Yeah. Okay. That makes good sense. I admire what you're trying to do.
[20:32.870 --> 20:39.990]  That's awesome. All right. So what was the CEC, right? CBC, Colorado veterans collective. So
[20:41.910 --> 20:48.390]  basically city council limits Colorado Springs now and L all of El Paso County on a 12 plan
[20:48.630 --> 20:52.710]  limit, no matter what. So even if you have a medical marijuana card from a doctor,
[20:55.030 --> 21:00.950]  is that upholdable in court? Oh, it will. If you go to, if you go up to like Denver court cats too.
[21:01.990 --> 21:06.950]  Yeah. What's up kitty on the show. That's the first cat. That's my rag doll. She's really nice,
[21:06.950 --> 21:10.150]  but she's loud as well. Oh, you guys will hear a cat and dogs on this show.
[21:10.870 --> 21:14.870]  You'll lose an El Paso County. You'll lose and you'll lose in the Colorado Springs. If you get
[21:14.870 --> 21:19.270]  busted in Colorado Springs, you lose in Colorado Springs, you lose in El Paso County until you got
[21:19.270 --> 21:23.190]  to go up to Denver. That's a lot. When you go to Denver, you win, right? Then you've already spent
[21:23.190 --> 21:26.630]  your life savings. Right. And they've already taken everything away from you. Okay. Do they
[21:26.630 --> 21:31.430]  take it down when they bust you now? I don't know. Or do they let you go through court before? I mean,
[21:31.430 --> 21:37.270]  I have no idea. I don't want to get there when they, when I heard them really, when I heard
[21:37.270 --> 21:41.350]  them start doing raids, I just pretty much cut everything down. I'm like, okay, room's done.
[21:42.310 --> 21:47.190]  Right. Well, yeah. And, um, you know, I've had to cut down to like an eighth. I used to smoke.
[21:47.190 --> 21:51.270]  I mean, what you saw me smoke tonight. I'll smoke, you know, eight grams, right. And that's,
[21:51.270 --> 21:55.830]  that used to be normal, right? Oh yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Oh my goodness. That distinction
[21:57.670 --> 22:02.390]  on this podcast, it wouldn't be a surprise to smoke eight grams in an episode or when one day
[22:02.390 --> 22:07.430]  at all. Right. We're way behind, but now I've had to cut it down to like an eighth, maybe, maybe,
[22:07.510 --> 22:13.670]  maybe two and a half grams a day just to not run out. So we started this. So my buddy called me
[22:13.670 --> 22:17.750]  cause he knew I was frustrated. And he's like, man, you got to call this other guy. And he's
[22:17.750 --> 22:23.430]  like, he will tell you how to do it and get into the industry where you can be legit a hundred
[22:23.430 --> 22:29.590]  percent. And you can operate to where you can still help veterans. You can help them in a way
[22:29.590 --> 22:34.950]  where you couldn't do it before, which was, I can recuperate the costs through my labor. Right.
[22:35.590 --> 22:44.150]  So I can do that. And then also now I can re what's what, what's the word I would say?
[22:45.510 --> 22:54.150]  I can feel like, um, now, so basically I can resupply the VFA with free cannabis.
[22:54.150 --> 22:59.510]  Oh, okay. So donations from the CVC. Right. So now we're all in house. See where this is going.
[22:59.510 --> 23:04.310]  Okay. So now we're keeping everything in house. It's all quality controlled. We know exactly who
[23:04.630 --> 23:10.550]  where it's coming from. Is the, the CVC going to be regulated by the Colorado MED?
[23:10.550 --> 23:15.990]  No. Okay. No, it's good. It's yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. So what we're looking for is basically,
[23:16.950 --> 23:24.070]  it's a place where we basically have a warehouse for your six plants because a lot of people,
[23:24.070 --> 23:29.590]  you know, cannot grow their plants, whether they can and just can't in their living space,
[23:29.590 --> 23:36.070]  or they don't have the green thumb to do so, or so, or the time, um, we are going to provide a
[23:36.070 --> 23:42.630]  place for their six plants and we'll take care of it for them. And it's just like babysitting them
[23:42.630 --> 23:49.910]  and have it giving them a place to grow. And then we will return their product to them. And all they
[23:49.910 --> 23:56.550]  have to do is reimburse us for, you know, our time and our costs. And through that, we'll be able to
[23:56.550 --> 24:01.510]  help a lot of people that would normally have to go to another recreational dispensary or to get a
[24:01.510 --> 24:06.470]  MED license or to get a red card. We don't have to do that. We operate according to amendment 64.
[24:06.470 --> 24:11.830]  Okay. There's, we're not operating in any gray or worse. What amendment 64 says is what we are doing.
[24:12.390 --> 24:18.470]  And for that, we're, we're not sketchy at all. And in amendment 64, what it says specifically
[24:18.470 --> 24:24.470]  is it lists out, you know, personal uses of marijuana. You can grow, you can store,
[24:24.470 --> 24:32.150]  you can consume all of these things. And in the last section in that part of the amendment,
[24:32.150 --> 24:39.190]  it says that anyone in a Colorado can assist you with any of the things in this personal usage
[24:39.190 --> 24:43.750]  category. So therefore you can have somebody babysitting your plants for you because they
[24:43.750 --> 24:49.430]  are allowed to assist you in growing. Right. Okay. And we love, and we love what we do. So
[24:49.510 --> 24:55.830]  Steve put his mic down for a minute. Yeah. And we love what we do. So why not do this? And this is
[24:55.830 --> 24:59.990]  a way for us to be able to provide a service that normally wouldn't be able to be provided. Right.
[24:59.990 --> 25:05.350]  And now, you know, with this service being the way it's going to be set up is now we can take
[25:05.350 --> 25:08.950]  in people, like we're going to take in five interns starting at the beginning of the year
[25:08.950 --> 25:13.030]  for an entire year. We're going to train five veterans up to get into the industry,
[25:13.030 --> 25:18.070]  to learn how the process works through the MED, buy their licenses, to get into the MED,
[25:18.070 --> 25:23.110]  get all that paperwork done. So when they're done after that year, we bring in master growers,
[25:23.110 --> 25:28.710]  like you or your boss or other bosses from different dispensaries. And they get to see
[25:28.710 --> 25:33.830]  stats and paperwork on these guys, how consistent they were, what they're testing, what the tests
[25:33.830 --> 25:39.350]  were on their, on their cannabis was. And, and basically you get to cherry pick and you get to
[25:39.350 --> 25:45.350]  figure out who's going to be your new grower and you get to hire them on the spot. So you're making
[25:45.350 --> 25:51.430]  kind of a master grower farm league. Right. That's awesome. I like it. We want to train these guys.
[25:52.790 --> 25:57.910]  I mean, a lot of these guys need a job or something to do, and we can train them as best we can and
[25:57.910 --> 26:04.630]  get them into these positions to keep them busy. And in that way, we're helping the community even
[26:04.630 --> 26:09.590]  more. And they'll get to grow the plots for the veterans that are giving you their plant counts,
[26:09.590 --> 26:13.430]  right? Exactly. And then you guys are going to train them. Right. They're going to be,
[26:13.430 --> 26:17.350]  I trust your guys' grow skills. Well, thank you. I mean, we're literally going to just tether them
[26:17.350 --> 26:20.950]  to us. We're going to just take them down the line. This is what we do. This is how we do it.
[26:20.950 --> 26:26.710]  This is why we do it. And, and, and it's not, Oh, this is just, it's in the book. And this is why,
[26:27.270 --> 26:31.190]  no, this is why we do it from personal experience. Here's the book for reference,
[26:31.190 --> 26:35.110]  you know, like teaming with microbes, teaming with nutrients. Those are good books for these
[26:35.110 --> 26:41.510]  guys to read. Not the, the grow Bible. When you got one that has like 600 pages. I mean,
[26:41.510 --> 26:45.990]  if you're going to do it like that, I mean, that's great, but I'd rather read something
[26:45.990 --> 26:51.110]  that's 200 pages and where you got to look up shit. And it's like, Oh wow. That's really amazing.
[26:51.110 --> 26:55.670]  Like you're actually learning and it's proactive instead of comprehensive instead of an encyclopedia.
[26:55.670 --> 27:03.110]  This is why it's green. Hey, because it works B because you didn't feed it. I mean, it's like,
[27:03.110 --> 27:07.430]  come on. I mean, a lot of growing knowledge is just through experience. So we're giving these guys
[27:07.430 --> 27:14.070]  experience and knowledge for free and eventually a job, hopefully out of it. That's pretty rad.
[27:14.070 --> 27:18.470]  Right. So maybe one day across Colorado, there'll be veterans running these grows
[27:18.470 --> 27:24.150]  or across the nation. That's the whole point. Once we go federal, we're really waiting for it.
[27:24.150 --> 27:29.110]  We're really just going to blow up with it because now we're going to be the only training facility
[27:29.110 --> 27:33.990]  in the United States that can train people and then send them out anywhere in the United States.
[27:34.950 --> 27:38.390]  The dogs think the buds smell great. They just got the seal of approval.
[27:40.230 --> 27:43.670]  Ziggy stole a bunch of sunset Sherbert off my tray the other day.
[27:43.670 --> 27:50.630]  Good dog. I mean, bad dogs don't do that. And veterans, they can just take control of the
[27:50.630 --> 27:55.190]  industry because they're some of the most disciplined, hardworking people you'll ever meet.
[27:55.190 --> 27:59.110]  I've been through three people in the grow facility so far that have not made the cut.
[27:59.110 --> 28:01.670]  I think some veterans might be the next on the shopping list.
[28:02.390 --> 28:05.910]  They're dedicated. They just want to work. They need a purpose. You give a veteran a purpose,
[28:05.910 --> 28:12.390]  he'll go a long way with you. He's loyal. He wants to be a part of something.
[28:12.390 --> 28:13.110]  Right. Loyal and disciplined.
[28:13.110 --> 28:15.110]  If it's great, then he's all about it.
[28:15.110 --> 28:20.470]  I like it. Is there somebody on your guys' team that knows how to build a good commercial-sized
[28:20.470 --> 28:22.710]  grow to keep everything that you're trying to do sustainable?
[28:23.910 --> 28:25.990]  I would say between John and I, we have it covered.
[28:25.990 --> 28:29.110]  Damn, I was just auditioning. I was just looking for...
[28:29.110 --> 28:30.710]  He's trying to get some consult gigs.
[28:32.470 --> 28:35.430]  Steve knows how to level what's ever already on the land that you buy.
[28:35.430 --> 28:42.310]  That's right. I can make holes. The land's pretty much ready to go. He's waiting on a house mover.
[28:42.310 --> 28:43.350]  His wife got cancer.
[28:43.350 --> 28:49.430]  We have the land. We need a building for this collective. That's going up here pretty soon,
[28:49.430 --> 28:49.670]  though.
[28:51.030 --> 28:54.230]  And the engineers can already come out, survey the land, and we're already ready to go.
[28:54.870 --> 29:00.550]  They can literally dump the concrete tomorrow. We can have the facility up within...
[29:01.270 --> 29:02.710]  What? Six weeks after that, you think?
[29:02.710 --> 29:06.790]  Yeah. And I've been working with Govetus for a while. And this whole last year,
[29:06.790 --> 29:12.150]  I've been focusing on grow room design and maximizing yields through that.
[29:12.150 --> 29:20.710]  So I think that after a year of focusing on that, we can create the grow that we need to be able to
[29:20.710 --> 29:24.230]  provide medicine for these guys at the cheapest cost possible.
[29:24.790 --> 29:30.150]  It's good to see the owners and founders and CEOs of a grow be the people that are going to be in
[29:30.310 --> 29:35.750]  getting their hands dirty because too often in the regulated industry, there are guys that own
[29:36.310 --> 29:39.910]  big businesses that just want to make more money and they buy into the cannabis industry.
[29:39.910 --> 29:46.950]  And then the growers are forced to just... They have to face conditions and do things.
[29:46.950 --> 29:52.550]  They have to compromise their integrity in a grow often because the owner doesn't want to spend the
[29:52.550 --> 29:56.310]  extra money to do it the way it should be. So it's good to see... And I'm not calling anybody
[29:56.710 --> 30:00.870]  my facility. I write a shopping list and it shows up. Shout out to my boss.
[30:00.870 --> 30:02.070]  That's pretty awesome.
[30:02.070 --> 30:06.310]  The owner of my facility, I write down a shopping list and take a picture of it and send it to him.
[30:06.310 --> 30:09.830]  And then the next day when he comes in, all that shit shows up. He's like,
[30:09.830 --> 30:13.110]  you don't need to be shopping and doing shit like that. You need to be growing cannabis.
[30:13.110 --> 30:14.070]  John Hunt's on the ball.
[30:14.070 --> 30:17.270]  Yeah. Shout out to John Hunt for all that. I love that you go to the store for me, bro. That helps
[30:17.270 --> 30:20.870]  me out. Get those CO2 tanks filled. They're sitting in the room waiting for you. But too
[30:20.870 --> 30:25.590]  many facilities have a lead guy that is just throwing dollars at somebody that doesn't care.
[30:25.670 --> 30:26.790]  They don't even smoke.
[30:26.790 --> 30:29.510]  That's what I was going to say. I've been to plenty. I worked at a facility. Oh no,
[30:29.510 --> 30:34.950]  I love that we agreed. I was employed by one facility where all of the upper management
[30:34.950 --> 30:39.910]  were snobs about hating potheads. They made fun of me because I was high all the time.
[30:40.470 --> 30:41.030]  I don't get it.
[30:41.030 --> 30:42.630]  That's a weird environment to work in.
[30:42.630 --> 30:44.790]  Your pockets are getting lined because of people that use this product.
[30:44.790 --> 30:48.390]  Because on my lunch break, I go in and spend half my paycheck and then I go home and enjoy
[30:48.390 --> 30:52.630]  it and come back. And yeah, you shouldn't be mad at us potheads. We're making a rich, bro.
[30:52.630 --> 30:53.750]  We bought that new Hummer.
[30:54.310 --> 31:00.230]  And the other part about this is none of this is about making money. We all will have our
[31:01.190 --> 31:04.710]  necessities taken care of and stuff, but nobody's going to get rich out of this.
[31:06.870 --> 31:09.910]  The only way this room looks like they really want to be blingy rich.
[31:09.910 --> 31:11.750]  Well, like a bunch of humble dudes.
[31:11.750 --> 31:14.870]  We just want to grow really good cannabis and help people out.
[31:14.870 --> 31:16.790]  Go from A to B and be comfortable.
[31:16.790 --> 31:19.510]  In almost any conditions. Colorado vehicle.
[31:20.470 --> 31:24.390]  That's it. It's going to be at least a 45 minute drive from me,
[31:24.390 --> 31:27.990]  from my house to the facility. I just need something that's reliable.
[31:27.990 --> 31:28.790]  Talk into your mic, bro. Sorry.
[31:28.790 --> 31:29.270]  Oh, sorry.
[31:29.270 --> 31:30.390]  Yeah, you're good. I got most of that.
[31:30.390 --> 31:33.430]  Okay. I just need something that's reliable and that's really it.
[31:34.710 --> 31:35.270]  I like it.
[31:35.270 --> 31:37.830]  A bunch of humble folks trying to grow cannabis for veterans.
[31:38.470 --> 31:42.550]  All right. So how long until this will realistically be going, the collective?
[31:43.430 --> 31:44.390]  We're thinking that...
[31:44.390 --> 31:46.550]  If we can get the guy to move the damn building.
[31:46.550 --> 31:51.350]  Right. And if that happens, we're thinking we'll have our facility built in...
[31:53.190 --> 31:53.750]  September.
[31:53.750 --> 31:55.350]  Early, mid-September.
[31:55.350 --> 31:56.390]  Mid, late September.
[31:56.390 --> 31:57.910]  Mid, late September, whatever.
[31:57.910 --> 31:59.590]  We got plans for October in there.
[32:00.870 --> 32:03.350]  October is absolutely drop dead.
[32:04.070 --> 32:08.950]  Right now we're waiting on a lawyer visit and buying our business license for
[32:09.830 --> 32:15.990]  our warehouse facility that we're creating. And after that, we wait, what was it?
[32:15.990 --> 32:19.190]  Six to eight weeks for that license. And then we can start signing people up.
[32:19.190 --> 32:22.710]  Yeah. Once we have the tax license and all that, we're ready to rock and roll.
[32:22.710 --> 32:27.270]  We do already have a website up at coloradoveteranscollective.com.
[32:27.270 --> 32:30.390]  coloradoveteranscollective.com. Check them out, you guys. Support that.
[32:30.390 --> 32:32.150]  Put a bunch of clicks on their website, share it.
[32:32.710 --> 32:35.350]  If you have a veteran friend, family member, if you're a veteran,
[32:35.910 --> 32:37.670]  share that with other veterans, go check it out.
[32:38.390 --> 32:41.510]  If you're a veteran, you should be friends with Steve DeFino on Facebook.
[32:42.310 --> 32:44.150]  He likes veterans of all shapes and ages.
[32:44.390 --> 32:45.430]  That sounds weird.
[32:45.430 --> 32:47.430]  That's all right. I didn't mean it like that.
[32:47.430 --> 32:51.190]  Well, actually I have a, my like page is a veteran farmers alliance.
[32:51.190 --> 32:54.150]  Oh, okay. Check that one out. You guys don't stalk his personal Facebook.
[32:54.150 --> 32:55.910]  Go to the veteran farmers alliance on Facebook.
[32:56.950 --> 32:59.510]  If I don't really know you, I don't usually add you.
[32:59.510 --> 33:01.190]  I get a lot of weird requests lately.
[33:01.190 --> 33:03.750]  Yeah, I've been getting a lot of weird stuff too lately.
[33:03.750 --> 33:05.750]  So I've just been a little more locked out.
[33:05.750 --> 33:07.190]  That's how it's gotta be.
[33:07.190 --> 33:10.710]  Yeah. But if you go on Facebook, veteran farmers alliance on Facebook.
[33:11.670 --> 33:17.190]  And you can go to contact us on our website at the CVC's website,
[33:17.190 --> 33:21.830]  and it will email one of us and we can get back to you as quick as we can.
[33:22.630 --> 33:25.270]  And when you do contact them, let them know that you heard about them
[33:25.270 --> 33:26.470]  through the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[33:26.470 --> 33:29.830]  Cause we would all like to know, we like to know where the resources came from
[33:29.830 --> 33:31.190]  and where things went and who heard what,
[33:31.190 --> 33:32.710]  and that's a good way to trace things back.
[33:32.710 --> 33:34.470]  And then they'll know where the relationship developed
[33:35.030 --> 33:36.550]  and then they'll treat you like a VIP.
[33:36.550 --> 33:38.310]  Cause we'll take good care of you.
[33:38.310 --> 33:39.590]  They'll take good care of you no matter what.
[33:40.070 --> 33:41.270]  Steve's always super kind.
[33:42.150 --> 33:43.030]  You ought to know about bro.
[33:43.030 --> 33:43.590]  No, I'm just kidding.
[33:43.590 --> 33:46.790]  We love to give away cannabis, you know.
[33:47.350 --> 33:48.310]  I'm the dark one here.
[33:49.590 --> 33:51.910]  I could kind of read that, but you saved the day by fixing the SD card.
[33:51.910 --> 33:53.430]  So we're going to give you a lot of today.
[33:53.430 --> 33:55.110]  I've got good core in me.
[33:57.350 --> 33:58.150]  Is it an Intel?
[34:00.310 --> 34:02.150]  So computer joke, computer joke.
[34:02.150 --> 34:02.950]  He's a computer guy.
[34:05.510 --> 34:08.630]  He told me he'll rip your computer apart and put it back together in 30 seconds.
[34:08.710 --> 34:09.430]  Uh, 30 minutes.
[34:09.430 --> 34:10.070]  30 minutes.
[34:10.070 --> 34:10.630]  Okay.
[34:10.630 --> 34:11.030]  All right.
[34:11.030 --> 34:12.630]  Do you get a free pizza if it's not ready?
[34:13.350 --> 34:13.510]  No.
[34:16.870 --> 34:17.750]  There are problems.
[34:18.630 --> 34:23.750]  So, so basically to, to keep our costs low for the CVC, I saw that.
[34:24.310 --> 34:25.590]  To keep our costs low.
[34:25.590 --> 34:29.030]  I'm going to pass this over to John because he's going to read off some of the main sponsors
[34:29.030 --> 34:30.950]  that are, have helped us for the CVC.
[34:31.990 --> 34:36.390]  And these are for the CVC to get you guys started with your facility and the building and the land.
[34:36.390 --> 34:36.710]  Okay.
[34:36.710 --> 34:37.990]  So let's hear it from these guys.
[34:37.990 --> 34:44.150]  Our first sponsor and the one that makes this incredibly possible for us to do and
[34:44.150 --> 34:47.350]  cheap for the veterans, uh, is Nectar for the Gods.
[34:47.830 --> 34:50.950]  Uh, Steve has been growing with Nectar for the Gods for.
[34:51.590 --> 34:52.230]  Few years.
[34:52.230 --> 34:52.630]  Yeah.
[34:52.630 --> 34:53.990]  Like two years now.
[34:53.990 --> 34:58.550]  And, um, he's gotten to know, uh, the owner really well.
[34:58.550 --> 35:00.070]  Scott Astro.
[35:00.070 --> 35:00.390]  Yes.
[35:00.390 --> 35:03.270]  And he's been, um, sponsored for a while by them.
[35:03.270 --> 35:08.630]  So we went to him with this idea that we had and, uh, Steve emailed him or Facebooked
[35:08.630 --> 35:13.430]  him and asked if he would continue the sponsorship and he agreed with it.
[35:13.430 --> 35:18.790]  And so we are getting our nutrients and soil for free, which helps us keep the cost down
[35:18.790 --> 35:19.670]  for the veterans.
[35:19.670 --> 35:20.230]  Yeah.
[35:20.230 --> 35:24.230]  Um, the reimbursement fee is, uh, planned to be at a hundred dollars at first.
[35:24.230 --> 35:29.590]  And remember this is recreational at a hundred dollars first and every sponsorship we get,
[35:29.590 --> 35:31.030]  we can take that chunk out.
[35:31.030 --> 35:37.030]  Our goal is $50 reimbursement because as our costs drop, so do the prices.
[35:37.030 --> 35:38.150]  Cause that's what we're doing.
[35:39.030 --> 35:39.270]  Yeah.
[35:39.270 --> 35:41.270]  I know we're not in a ghetto, but I do hear fireworks.
[35:41.270 --> 35:42.150]  Those are fireworks.
[35:42.150 --> 35:42.870]  They're not gunshots.
[35:43.670 --> 35:45.510]  If we were at my house, it would be questionable.
[35:47.350 --> 35:47.670]  Yeah.
[35:47.670 --> 35:48.710]  Our old house as well.
[35:50.710 --> 35:52.230]  I thought Pueblo was bad.
[35:52.230 --> 35:53.750]  Colorado Springs is getting there.
[35:53.750 --> 35:56.070]  Oh, I've had some interesting neighbors.
[35:57.030 --> 35:57.350]  All right.
[35:57.350 --> 35:58.550]  And let's see what else we got.
[35:58.550 --> 35:59.590]  Some seed sponsors.
[35:59.590 --> 36:04.230]  We got Gonzo seeds, uh, given us the genetics we need.
[36:04.230 --> 36:07.350]  Uh, obviously we've been on Tok radio on Monday.
[36:07.350 --> 36:11.830]  Uh, they enjoyed our time up there and we will probably be going back.
[36:11.830 --> 36:13.430]  Those guys are really awesome.
[36:13.430 --> 36:17.830]  Uh, they're going to have our, uh, commercials run on their radio show.
[36:17.830 --> 36:18.470]  Cool.
[36:18.470 --> 36:19.830]  Uh, we got pollination.
[36:20.390 --> 36:24.950]  Um, Steve knows Ryan really well and they're, they have some killer strains.
[36:24.950 --> 36:28.150]  And so they're going to be sending us some of their genetics to work with.
[36:28.630 --> 36:30.630]  Uh, CB one analytics.
[36:30.630 --> 36:36.150]  Uh, Steve got in contact with those guys and Tuesday and they're going to be running all
[36:36.150 --> 36:39.590]  of our, uh, all of our testing for us for free as well.
[36:39.590 --> 36:41.750]  So we can know exactly what we're giving these guys.
[36:41.750 --> 36:42.710]  Very cool.
[36:42.710 --> 36:44.870]  You guys will have some Irish genetics in that garden also.
[36:44.870 --> 36:45.830]  Of course we will.
[36:45.830 --> 36:46.390]  Guaranteed.
[36:46.950 --> 36:47.990]  Sounds good to me.
[36:47.990 --> 36:48.870]  I'm excited for that.
[36:50.390 --> 36:52.790]  I've got some high yielding stuff that you guys will appreciate.
[36:52.790 --> 36:53.110]  Oh yeah.
[36:53.110 --> 36:54.070]  We love that stuff.
[36:54.070 --> 36:54.310]  Yep.
[36:56.150 --> 36:56.630]  Keep going, man.
[36:56.630 --> 36:57.510]  Sorry to mean to cut you off.
[36:58.470 --> 37:03.190]  That's the list we have so far, but even with just those, we're able to keep the cost down
[37:03.190 --> 37:04.310]  as best we can.
[37:04.310 --> 37:09.590]  Uh, everything else that we can add on there, we'll just be cutting off and making it cheaper
[37:09.590 --> 37:10.230]  for these guys.
[37:11.110 --> 37:11.350]  Yep.
[37:11.350 --> 37:14.710]  Every time we can chop at that price to bring it down, it's just a better advantage for
[37:14.710 --> 37:15.350]  these guys.
[37:15.350 --> 37:19.190]  So if I were a veteran and I signed my plants over to you and then I wait probably 60 or
[37:19.190 --> 37:23.590]  90 days so that you could pull my plants down and get a harvest out of them, uh, for a hundred
[37:23.590 --> 37:28.150]  dollars to start, what realistically, what amount of medicine can I expect from you?
[37:29.590 --> 37:33.750]  Well, I guess it depends on the size of the plants we grow, but I mean,
[37:33.750 --> 37:34.390]  What were you thinking?
[37:34.390 --> 37:35.110]  Three gallons?
[37:35.670 --> 37:36.950]  Three to five gallon plants.
[37:37.750 --> 37:38.390]  Okay.
[37:38.390 --> 37:40.230]  And six of them because that's your legal.
[37:40.230 --> 37:43.030]  Well, three, three in flower, three in veg.
[37:43.030 --> 37:43.590]  Three plants.
[37:43.590 --> 37:44.150]  Okay.
[37:44.150 --> 37:45.030]  That makes more sense.
[37:45.030 --> 37:45.750]  Three and three.
[37:45.750 --> 37:46.230]  Okay.
[37:46.230 --> 37:50.150]  And, uh, and we'll keep it on a pretty nice rotation for everyone.
[37:50.150 --> 37:54.070]  Everything will be numbered by patient and everything like that.
[37:54.070 --> 37:55.990]  So we'll be able to keep it constant.
[37:55.990 --> 38:01.590]  And, uh, of course, you know, the better we grow, the more will come out of each plant.
[38:01.590 --> 38:08.230]  And so eventually they'll be getting potentially more than they can actually consume.
[38:08.230 --> 38:13.990]  And at that point there, they can waive their cost and give their product back to us.
[38:13.990 --> 38:18.550]  And that's where we're going to be able to start giving away free product through back
[38:18.550 --> 38:19.430]  to the VFA.
[38:19.590 --> 38:21.030]  Yeah, exactly.
[38:21.030 --> 38:22.070]  I like that chain of command.
[38:22.070 --> 38:23.430]  That's working really well for you.
[38:23.430 --> 38:23.670]  Yeah.
[38:23.670 --> 38:28.150]  There's no loose ends where money or anything just sits around.
[38:28.150 --> 38:32.070]  We're always just trying to give back as good as fast as we can.
[38:32.070 --> 38:32.710]  That's awesome.
[38:32.710 --> 38:36.150]  Well, it's like, you know, city council, when they did the whole 12 plant count, it really
[38:36.150 --> 38:36.790]  just broke me.
[38:37.430 --> 38:41.110]  And I was just, I was really upset and I was like, man, there's gotta be a way around this.
[38:41.110 --> 38:44.550]  And that was such a ridiculous way to do it because nobody at that meeting, oh, we've
[38:44.550 --> 38:45.030]  been over this.
[38:45.030 --> 38:47.430]  Nobody at that meeting wanted that to go through.
[38:47.430 --> 38:49.830]  No, no one, not, not one person.
[38:49.830 --> 38:55.350]  There was four people that wanted it to go through plus the, the, the city council members.
[38:55.350 --> 38:59.430]  And that was about 150 to 200 that were opposed to that measure passing.
[38:59.430 --> 39:00.630]  There's so many.
[39:00.630 --> 39:01.750]  There's so many people there.
[39:01.750 --> 39:07.270]  I watched that on the internet and you could even feel the vibe of the room coming from
[39:07.270 --> 39:09.510]  the computer screen saying, no, no, no.
[39:09.510 --> 39:13.110]  I live in another city and I was still paying attention because you guys had me rallied.
[39:13.110 --> 39:15.030]  It was four hours of testimony.
[39:15.830 --> 39:17.350]  It was 13 minutes.
[39:17.350 --> 39:18.870]  I saw Andrew's part.
[39:18.870 --> 39:19.110]  Yeah.
[39:19.110 --> 39:21.430]  Oh, that was intense.
[39:21.430 --> 39:21.990]  That was great.
[39:22.950 --> 39:23.590]  They didn't like it.
[39:23.590 --> 39:27.510]  So you said that there was another bill coming up that you wanted to talk about?
[39:27.510 --> 39:27.910]  Right?
[39:27.910 --> 39:34.310]  So apparently, uh, somebody has gathered enough signatures to possibly add this to the ballot
[39:34.310 --> 39:35.030]  for this year.
[39:35.030 --> 39:40.710]  And it's to limit the percentage of THC in every single product, whether it's medical
[39:40.710 --> 39:42.470]  or recreational at 16%.
[39:42.950 --> 39:47.270]  16% THC in anything, everything.
[39:47.270 --> 39:55.830]  So the flower, I'm flabbergasted how I would have to get rid of every flower in my garden
[39:55.830 --> 39:57.350]  or cut it down at week five.
[39:57.350 --> 39:57.910]  Right.
[39:57.910 --> 40:04.870]  And who the hell wants to smoke week five way that doesn't even smoke 16% does that
[40:04.870 --> 40:10.790]  mean that this slab of shatter could only test at 16% THC.
[40:10.790 --> 40:11.190]  Right.
[40:11.190 --> 40:12.070]  That's pointless.
[40:12.950 --> 40:13.350]  Yeah.
[40:13.350 --> 40:17.670]  I don't, we'd have to put, I could be, I could be a little off, but okay.
[40:17.670 --> 40:19.430]  Well, I'm pretty sure you're correct with the flower.
[40:19.430 --> 40:20.470]  Cause I read this somewhere else.
[40:20.470 --> 40:20.550]  Yeah.
[40:20.550 --> 40:24.870]  But that's, I mean, if it's, if, from what I heard last night, it was everything.
[40:24.870 --> 40:28.630]  And if that's the point, whether it's recreational or medical, well, who the hell is that going
[40:28.630 --> 40:29.030]  to benefit?
[40:29.030 --> 40:30.550]  It's no longer medical, right?
[40:30.550 --> 40:32.710]  It's going to destroy dispensaries.
[40:32.710 --> 40:33.830]  It's going to destroy everyone.
[40:34.470 --> 40:37.750]  I mean, what happens if you test over, do you have to just throw it away?
[40:37.750 --> 40:38.710]  Probably destroy it.
[40:38.710 --> 40:39.030]  Right.
[40:39.030 --> 40:40.310]  You have to just destroy it.
[40:40.310 --> 40:40.790]  Yep.
[40:40.790 --> 40:44.310]  And for that to happen, I mean, that's just, man, that's just wrong.
[40:44.310 --> 40:45.270]  Such a waste.
[40:45.270 --> 40:51.270]  I, I, I'm not a quitter, but if you told me that I couldn't grow cannabis over 16% THC
[40:51.270 --> 40:52.230]  anymore, I might quit.
[40:52.230 --> 40:52.870]  Well, I'd move.
[40:53.430 --> 40:54.070]  Yeah.
[40:54.070 --> 40:56.070]  I just have to move the operation somewhere else.
[40:56.070 --> 41:00.150]  There's no way to really, I mean, terpenes are great, but they only take, I mean, and
[41:00.150 --> 41:06.950]  in, in THC is great, but there's the combination of both in, in high forms that are just truly
[41:06.950 --> 41:07.510]  beneficial.
[41:07.510 --> 41:09.270]  The perfect medicine right there.
[41:09.270 --> 41:10.230]  Missing either one.
[41:10.230 --> 41:14.950]  And it's just going to be, you know, synthesized THC or it's going to be, it's going to be
[41:14.950 --> 41:17.830]  blah, blah, you know, essential oil, terpenes.
[41:17.830 --> 41:19.350]  Do you know the reasoning behind this idea?
[41:20.150 --> 41:20.710]  Ignorance.
[41:20.710 --> 41:22.150]  Ignorance is the answer.
[41:22.150 --> 41:22.950]  Yeah.
[41:22.950 --> 41:23.270]  Wow.
[41:23.910 --> 41:26.790]  Somebody trying to control the industry that can't go.
[41:26.790 --> 41:27.830]  That's, that would ruin everything.
[41:27.830 --> 41:28.790]  You know what I think it is?
[41:28.790 --> 41:33.510]  I think, I think they make so much money in the black market, like busting people in the
[41:33.510 --> 41:38.310]  black market that they're trying to revert it back a little bit so they can just keep
[41:38.310 --> 41:42.870]  going after it and just keep nailing that each nail into the coffin just to make it
[41:42.870 --> 41:44.470]  worse to make us criminals again.
[41:44.470 --> 41:46.310]  I'm kind of like, I'm flabbergasted.
[41:46.310 --> 41:49.510]  I'm like, you gave us this and now you want to take it away.
[41:49.510 --> 41:51.430]  And they like, wow, thank you government.
[41:51.430 --> 41:54.390]  You're definitely the piece by piece.
[41:54.390 --> 41:54.630]  Right.
[41:54.630 --> 41:57.750]  I mean, that's kind of what the government's been lately.
[41:57.750 --> 41:58.710]  It's like, here, take this.
[41:58.710 --> 41:59.670]  And they're like, oh, just kidding.
[42:00.550 --> 42:01.350]  It's like, come on.
[42:01.350 --> 42:04.310]  You just made it illegal in a different twist with the law.
[42:04.390 --> 42:09.190]  You can't grow at home because you are just going to cause problems.
[42:09.190 --> 42:11.110]  And now you can't buy good weed at dispensary.
[42:11.110 --> 42:12.390]  So go home and grow your good weed.
[42:12.390 --> 42:13.510]  Oh, you can't do that anymore.
[42:13.510 --> 42:13.830]  Yeah.
[42:13.830 --> 42:14.790]  No, no, no, no, no.
[42:14.790 --> 42:15.030]  Yeah.
[42:15.590 --> 42:20.790]  But you can drink and pop all your pills and I just hate to go back to all that, but it's like,
[42:21.350 --> 42:22.470]  come on, man.
[42:22.470 --> 42:22.950]  Right.
[42:22.950 --> 42:26.870]  How many people do you see when you're out in Colorado Springs?
[42:26.870 --> 42:30.230]  How many people do you see that are just too high for their own good on cannabis that are
[42:30.230 --> 42:30.950]  causing a problem?
[42:31.910 --> 42:32.390]  None.
[42:32.390 --> 42:32.710]  None.
[42:32.710 --> 42:34.070]  I see a lot of meth heads.
[42:34.470 --> 42:39.110]  I wasn't trying to go there, but how many people do you see on a bicycle as soon as the sun goes
[42:39.110 --> 42:43.030]  down with a fucking headlamp on their forehead, picking at a sword, driving around, peeking at
[42:43.030 --> 42:43.910]  every trash can?
[42:43.910 --> 42:44.710]  Oh, yeah.
[42:44.710 --> 42:45.190]  Everywhere.
[42:45.190 --> 42:46.950]  You got to dodge them on your car right now.
[42:46.950 --> 42:47.990]  You got to throw something away.
[42:47.990 --> 42:48.790]  They're like, hey.
[42:48.790 --> 42:49.030]  Yeah.
[42:49.030 --> 42:50.150]  They're like, oh, shit.
[42:50.150 --> 42:50.550]  Sorry.
[42:50.550 --> 42:51.270]  What do you got there?
[42:51.990 --> 42:52.630]  I'll sell this.
[42:53.270 --> 42:54.550]  Seriously, they're everywhere.
[42:54.550 --> 42:54.710]  Yeah.
[42:54.710 --> 42:56.070]  You don't want that illegal.
[42:56.070 --> 42:57.270]  Stoners aren't the problem.
[42:57.270 --> 42:58.070]  That's for sure.
[42:58.070 --> 42:58.310]  Yeah.
[42:58.310 --> 42:58.710]  We're not.
[42:59.270 --> 43:01.270]  And the ones that are the problem are less than 1%.
[43:02.230 --> 43:05.430]  But they're going after them and then punishing the rest of us.
[43:05.430 --> 43:05.830]  Right.
[43:05.830 --> 43:09.830]  Making an example out of that one asshole that wasn't even part of the crew that we would have
[43:09.830 --> 43:12.630]  shunned him and punished him anyway if we saw his action.
[43:12.630 --> 43:13.110]  Absolutely.
[43:13.110 --> 43:14.550]  We don't want that in our community.
[43:14.550 --> 43:15.750]  We don't want that in our community.
[43:15.750 --> 43:20.230]  We want to be able to support our community and be able to show people that we're in this for the
[43:20.230 --> 43:20.790]  good reasons.
[43:20.790 --> 43:22.150]  This isn't the black market.
[43:22.150 --> 43:29.110]  This is, we just need to get rid of all these regulations just trying to tie us down.
[43:29.670 --> 43:33.430]  I mean, yeah, there's, there is too many plants in a house.
[43:33.430 --> 43:36.390]  I mean, if it's too powerful for the grid, it'll burn the grid up.
[43:36.390 --> 43:36.950]  I get that.
[43:36.950 --> 43:38.470]  You'll get a house fire.
[43:38.470 --> 43:44.230]  So whatever on that, but there's people that need 40, 50, 60 plants and that's perfectly
[43:44.230 --> 43:45.190]  acceptable in a home.
[43:45.830 --> 43:46.150]  Yeah.
[43:46.150 --> 43:49.110]  And, and you can do that safely and there's no reason you can't.
[43:49.110 --> 43:53.350]  I mean, especially with kids that like parents that there's one lady that has 19 different
[43:53.350 --> 43:58.870]  strains for her child and it works and she can't, she loses those strains.
[43:58.950 --> 43:59.990]  It's like, she's screwed.
[44:00.870 --> 44:03.510]  And that's the kid, you know, that kid needs that.
[44:03.510 --> 44:08.310]  And I mean, it's, it's pretty powerful to be able to provide something like that for a child
[44:08.310 --> 44:09.190]  in your own home.
[44:09.190 --> 44:13.030]  And then somebody tries to say, no, it's like, fuck you.
[44:13.030 --> 44:13.910]  You can't do that.
[44:13.910 --> 44:15.110]  Go to the store.
[44:15.110 --> 44:15.430]  Right.
[44:15.430 --> 44:15.590]  Yeah.
[44:17.030 --> 44:17.190]  Yeah.
[44:17.190 --> 44:18.150]  It doesn't work the same.
[44:18.150 --> 44:19.030]  It's missing shit.
[44:19.030 --> 44:20.230]  That's mass produced.
[44:20.230 --> 44:21.830]  It's like your own house.
[44:21.830 --> 44:28.150]  It's expensive for the price of, I don't exactly know what a gram cost to produce at home.
[44:28.230 --> 44:32.310]  I've done math and it's come out somewhere between 50 cents and two bucks a gram, I think
[44:32.310 --> 44:35.750]  to produce cannabis at home, just depending on what kind of nutrients and what your electrical
[44:35.750 --> 44:36.950]  happens to be where you are.
[44:36.950 --> 44:37.430]  Yeah.
[44:37.430 --> 44:39.510]  I've heard as low as 30 cents a gram.
[44:39.510 --> 44:40.310]  What dispensary?
[44:40.310 --> 44:42.310]  Can you find anything for 30 cents?
[44:42.310 --> 44:42.870]  Right.
[44:42.870 --> 44:43.430]  Right.
[44:43.430 --> 44:45.030]  I'm probably cheaper than that at my house.
[44:45.030 --> 44:50.390]  10 or $12 a gram at a dispensary minimum plus taxes plus getting there.
[44:50.390 --> 44:50.790]  Right.
[44:50.790 --> 44:51.350]  Plus.
[44:51.350 --> 44:53.030]  We'll look at recreational tax too.
[44:53.030 --> 44:54.630]  And who knows what was sprayed on it?
[44:54.630 --> 44:57.030]  Who knows what kind of nutrients it was grown with?
[44:57.030 --> 45:00.070]  I mean, does everything get tested for, for, was it pyrethrium?
[45:00.070 --> 45:00.390]  I believe.
[45:01.910 --> 45:05.430]  So all of the recreational products are currently tested.
[45:05.430 --> 45:07.510]  July 1st was supposed to be the date.
[45:07.510 --> 45:09.670]  I was going to do another show about this, but we'll just talk about it now.
[45:09.670 --> 45:13.190]  July 1st was supposed to be the date when all of the medical products were tested, but
[45:13.190 --> 45:15.030]  they've pushed it back to later in the year.
[45:15.030 --> 45:18.310]  It's going to be closer to September or October before they're able to test everything.
[45:18.310 --> 45:20.310]  Somebody's got to get all their sprayed weed through first.
[45:21.190 --> 45:22.790]  We don't have enough facilities.
[45:22.790 --> 45:25.830]  They haven't regulated enough testing facilities to do all of that.
[45:25.830 --> 45:29.030]  So if they implement that, there's just going to be pounds sitting there and all the shelves
[45:29.030 --> 45:31.350]  are going to go bare because nobody can test the products.
[45:31.350 --> 45:33.670]  See, it's like, why aren't we focusing on that?
[45:33.670 --> 45:37.910]  Why are we going after less than 1% and punishing everybody else?
[45:37.910 --> 45:41.990]  And we'll keep you going about the regulation and just setting the standard and making a
[45:41.990 --> 45:44.870]  good presentation for the rest of the, you know, nations.
[45:44.870 --> 45:51.430]  If we had eight or 12 good, solid standardized testing facilities that were bringing in an
[45:51.430 --> 45:54.230]  excise tax every time that product got tested.
[45:54.230 --> 45:58.390]  Do you think they would replace the revenues that they're making off of busting petty weed
[45:58.390 --> 45:58.790]  crimes?
[46:00.310 --> 46:01.110]  Probably not.
[46:01.110 --> 46:01.910]  No, probably not.
[46:01.910 --> 46:03.510]  It would definitely look better.
[46:04.390 --> 46:06.630]  I mean, we just need some sort of operation.
[46:06.630 --> 46:07.430]  People will see it.
[46:07.430 --> 46:08.950]  They will start to accept it.
[46:08.950 --> 46:10.390]  It just takes time.
[46:10.390 --> 46:14.870]  You know, there's like my wife, three and a half, four years ago, she was like, no, no
[46:14.870 --> 46:15.590]  weed in my house.
[46:16.310 --> 46:17.830]  I think I'm like, wow.
[46:17.830 --> 46:18.230]  Yeah.
[46:18.230 --> 46:20.950]  And now she's like, well, this, you know, it works.
[46:20.950 --> 46:22.150]  She believes in it.
[46:22.150 --> 46:23.350]  She hates the smell.
[46:24.310 --> 46:25.190]  She doesn't smell.
[46:25.750 --> 46:26.630]  And I respect that.
[46:26.630 --> 46:29.350]  She's, you know, she, she's actually allergic to it.
[46:29.350 --> 46:32.230]  She tries really hard to like it and she does a good job.
[46:32.230 --> 46:32.630]  She does.
[46:32.630 --> 46:33.830]  She's a good supporter of it.
[46:33.830 --> 46:34.390]  She's awesome.
[46:35.750 --> 46:37.190]  Well, it's just saved me.
[46:37.190 --> 46:37.510]  Yeah.
[46:37.510 --> 46:37.910]  Definitely.
[46:37.910 --> 46:41.590]  I mean, you probably should probably have taken off if you were just going to keep being
[46:41.590 --> 46:42.230]  an asshole.
[46:42.230 --> 46:43.030]  Yeah, right.
[46:43.030 --> 46:45.030]  I mean, it saved our money.
[46:45.590 --> 46:51.350]  I mean, I've been able to go shopping again and, and get food on the table again.
[46:51.350 --> 46:57.030]  Once I started growing for myself, it was like, wow, I wasn't spending 2,700 to $3,000
[46:57.030 --> 46:58.230]  a month dispensary.
[46:59.110 --> 46:59.350]  Right.
[46:59.350 --> 47:00.070]  It was bad.
[47:00.070 --> 47:03.590]  How many prescriptions were you able to eliminate using cannabis?
[47:04.870 --> 47:06.230]  Like 24.
[47:08.150 --> 47:09.110]  It's bigger than you thought.
[47:09.750 --> 47:13.670]  Man, I don't mean to laugh at that, but 24 different prescriptions.
[47:13.670 --> 47:15.430]  You've been through like all of them.
[47:15.430 --> 47:16.230]  With cannabis.
[47:16.230 --> 47:16.790]  Right.
[47:16.790 --> 47:21.190]  And if you were going to, if you're having a shitty week and you're not feeling your
[47:21.190 --> 47:23.750]  best and need extra medicine, how much are you going to smoke in a whole week?
[47:25.590 --> 47:25.910]  Now?
[47:26.790 --> 47:27.190]  Yeah.
[47:27.190 --> 47:28.470]  This, this week.
[47:28.470 --> 47:29.190]  Maybe an ounce.
[47:29.830 --> 47:30.150]  Okay.
[47:30.150 --> 47:33.430]  So somewhere between 150 and 200 bucks worth of quality cannabis.
[47:33.430 --> 47:37.990]  But if you grew it yourself, we're looking at 28 grams, maybe 28 bucks worth of.
[47:38.550 --> 47:39.590]  Maybe $10.
[47:39.590 --> 47:40.470]  $10 worth of.
[47:41.030 --> 47:41.510]  Okay.
[47:41.510 --> 47:43.270]  Everything's pretty much sponsored for me.
[47:43.270 --> 47:46.230]  So the nutrients are paid for and you get the seeds.
[47:46.230 --> 47:47.670]  I pay water and lights.
[47:47.670 --> 47:48.070]  Okay.
[47:48.070 --> 47:50.070]  And your energy, your, I mean, your effort.
[47:50.070 --> 47:50.470]  Yeah.
[47:50.470 --> 47:53.350]  Well, yeah, but I don't really, that's not what I include.
[47:53.350 --> 47:53.990]  Okay.
[47:53.990 --> 47:54.710]  But that's it.
[47:54.710 --> 47:57.110]  So, I mean, it's, it's to me, it's like nothing.
[47:57.110 --> 47:58.390]  I just, I do it for the joy.
[47:58.390 --> 47:59.670]  For pennies on the dollar.
[47:59.670 --> 48:03.190]  I think that the, uh, the growing of it is therapeutic for you also.
[48:03.190 --> 48:04.470]  Cause I see you light up.
[48:04.470 --> 48:06.790]  Like when we talk about pot, you smile more than anything.
[48:06.790 --> 48:07.590]  Yeah, I do.
[48:07.590 --> 48:07.750]  Yeah.
[48:07.750 --> 48:08.230]  That's right.
[48:08.230 --> 48:11.990]  I go into his room with him and it's just details here and there.
[48:11.990 --> 48:13.590]  It shows you every single plant.
[48:13.590 --> 48:16.070]  It's definitely part of the healing process.
[48:16.070 --> 48:18.470]  And that's another reason why we want to bring these guys in.
[48:18.470 --> 48:19.910]  Cause it will work for other people.
[48:19.910 --> 48:21.750]  I know I feel calm in my garden.
[48:21.750 --> 48:22.150]  Me too.
[48:22.150 --> 48:26.950]  I could be, I have to drive 55 miles from my house to the office every day.
[48:26.950 --> 48:30.710]  And the last 10 miles of that drive is like bumper to bumper madness.
[48:31.830 --> 48:35.110]  I could probably park my car, run up to the guy in front of me and punch him in the face
[48:35.110 --> 48:37.670]  six times and get back in my car before traffic even moved.
[48:37.670 --> 48:42.870]  And by the time I get in the grow, it's just like, ah, yeah, it's nice.
[48:42.870 --> 48:48.790]  And green, beautiful oxygen, a bunch of fans and it's 74 degrees and I'm happy.
[48:48.790 --> 48:50.150]  I like that temperature.
[48:50.150 --> 48:51.430]  Yeah, definitely.
[48:51.430 --> 48:53.190]  74, 77 ish.
[48:53.190 --> 48:53.510]  Yeah.
[48:53.510 --> 48:54.150]  Glorious.
[48:54.150 --> 48:54.710]  Yes, it is.
[48:55.670 --> 48:59.110]  I love to get it down to like 72 in the last two and a half weeks.
[48:59.110 --> 48:59.830]  Okay.
[48:59.830 --> 49:03.110]  If I wasn't running a big perpetual, I would do things a little bit differently.
[49:03.110 --> 49:06.470]  But with the perpetual, you have to keep it ideal across the board.
[49:06.470 --> 49:10.390]  Cause I've got, uh, there are plants three, every three weeks there are new plants going
[49:10.390 --> 49:10.470]  in.
[49:10.470 --> 49:15.110]  So I've got stuff at week one, week three and week six or week nine, six and three.
[49:15.110 --> 49:18.310]  So I have to have 12, 12 and 74 degrees.
[49:18.310 --> 49:19.270]  12, 12.
[49:19.270 --> 49:19.590]  Yeah.
[49:19.590 --> 49:19.750]  Yeah.
[49:19.750 --> 49:25.030]  We've, well, I've, I've been playing with, with light manipulation lately and we'll,
[49:25.030 --> 49:27.110]  I like, uh, I did it 35 days.
[49:27.110 --> 49:28.710]  I flipped into 11, 13.
[49:28.710 --> 49:33.510]  I did the last one at 15 days and then I did one at just straight 11, 13.
[49:33.510 --> 49:39.670]  And I'm going to see how, if anything, any flavor changes or anything's enhanced or if
[49:39.670 --> 49:39.990]  anything,
[49:39.990 --> 49:45.830]  What I noticed from the 11, 13 was when I was doing Fino hunts, I would see much more
[49:45.910 --> 49:48.630]  phenotypical expression with the extended dark period.
[49:48.630 --> 49:51.750]  I would see much more variation from different phenotypes.
[49:51.750 --> 49:53.510]  So for a breeder, that was really handy.
[49:53.510 --> 49:56.630]  What I did notice was it kind of diminished on my harvest weight.
[49:56.630 --> 49:56.790]  Yeah.
[49:56.790 --> 49:58.230]  My unit wasn't where it should be.
[49:58.230 --> 49:58.790]  Yeah.
[49:58.790 --> 50:00.550]  Seemed to finish a little quicker too.
[50:00.550 --> 50:01.430]  They finished quicker.
[50:01.430 --> 50:02.070]  Absolutely.
[50:02.070 --> 50:02.550]  Yeah.
[50:02.550 --> 50:03.030]  Yeah.
[50:03.030 --> 50:06.710]  And I've actually gotten a bump in weight from switching over to 11, 13.
[50:06.710 --> 50:08.950]  It might've been that mammoth microbes.
[50:08.950 --> 50:09.990]  Well, it's been both.
[50:09.990 --> 50:10.310]  Yeah.
[50:10.310 --> 50:12.070]  You said you wanted to give a shout out to mammoth.
[50:12.070 --> 50:12.630]  So that's a beautiful time to do it.
[50:12.630 --> 50:14.550]  Mammoth microbes has been huge for me.
[50:14.550 --> 50:15.110]  I love that.
[50:15.110 --> 50:19.750]  That product, it has made some of the densest, stickiest nugs I've ever had.
[50:20.550 --> 50:22.070]  Is it MED approved?
[50:22.070 --> 50:23.910]  Can we use it in the MED grows?
[50:23.910 --> 50:25.030]  I don't see why you couldn't.
[50:25.030 --> 50:25.270]  Okay.
[50:25.270 --> 50:26.470]  Well, a lot of products are banned.
[50:26.470 --> 50:27.750]  A lot of shit is banned.
[50:27.750 --> 50:28.150]  Right.
[50:28.150 --> 50:29.910]  It's a microbial inoculant.
[50:29.910 --> 50:30.790]  I'm not quite sure.
[50:30.790 --> 50:31.750]  It should be legit then.
[50:31.750 --> 50:32.710]  I'll check it out.
[50:32.710 --> 50:34.790]  I'll compare it to the other things that I use.
[50:35.430 --> 50:37.430]  I can't talk about one of the products that I use.
[50:38.150 --> 50:39.270]  They're secrets.
[50:39.270 --> 50:39.590]  Yeah.
[50:39.590 --> 50:43.910]  That's just a proprietary thing, but we also use the Veg Bloom Plus Life.
[50:43.910 --> 50:46.550]  And so I'll compare it to that and see if it's got the same stuff in there.
[50:46.550 --> 50:48.150]  You don't pee on your plants, do you?
[50:48.150 --> 50:48.310]  No.
[50:48.310 --> 50:49.510]  What did you hear me say that?
[50:49.510 --> 50:49.670]  No.
[50:50.630 --> 50:51.590]  That's the secret, right?
[50:51.590 --> 50:53.590]  I've actually told people to pee in their plants.
[50:53.590 --> 50:54.550]  How do you make your plants like that?
[50:54.550 --> 50:56.070]  Just pee in them every morning?
[50:56.070 --> 50:58.230]  Drink six Guinnesses, go to bed, wake up.
[50:58.870 --> 51:00.630]  First piece makes it expand.
[51:01.190 --> 51:02.470]  The microbes travel through.
[51:02.470 --> 51:05.430]  It's so disgusting with that dark, thick, frothy piss right in your plants.
[51:05.430 --> 51:05.750]  Yeah.
[51:05.750 --> 51:07.030]  Don't be doing that.
[51:07.030 --> 51:08.470]  Dad, don't do that, please.
[51:09.030 --> 51:10.470]  Do not piss on your plants.
[51:11.190 --> 51:15.350]  It might work at first, but maybe for a short while.
[51:15.350 --> 51:16.390]  I don't want to smoke it.
[51:16.390 --> 51:18.070]  I haven't had a Guinness in like eight years.
[51:18.070 --> 51:20.550]  Gosh, I don't even want to think about that.
[51:20.550 --> 51:20.790]  Nope.
[51:22.070 --> 51:22.390]  All right.
[51:22.390 --> 51:23.990]  Mammoth Microbes, big shout out to him.
[51:23.990 --> 51:25.350]  Steve's got to go refill his water.
[51:25.990 --> 51:27.590]  Man, we've been going for almost an hour.
[51:27.590 --> 51:28.870]  You guys, you're talkative folks.
[51:28.870 --> 51:29.110]  I like that.
[51:29.110 --> 51:32.630]  We were already going for a while before too, just talking here without...
[51:32.630 --> 51:36.390]  We had to spend 30 minutes getting my SD card fixed because for some reason it didn't want
[51:36.390 --> 51:39.750]  to work when I showed up to record, which was almost embarrassing, but we pulled it off.
[51:39.830 --> 51:40.790]  It's electronics, man.
[51:40.790 --> 51:41.510]  That just happens.
[51:42.790 --> 51:45.670]  I just put it in the case and carried it, and for some reason it didn't work.
[51:45.670 --> 51:46.070]  All right.
[51:46.790 --> 51:50.230]  I feel like since Steve left, we're all stuck at a low because he's got a notebook over there
[51:50.230 --> 51:51.990]  and he was kind of running the show.
[51:51.990 --> 51:53.590]  Steve's definitely the talker.
[51:53.590 --> 51:55.350]  Yeah, he's a people person.
[51:55.350 --> 51:56.470]  We're just...
[51:56.470 --> 51:57.510]  We're the growers.
[51:57.510 --> 52:01.350]  We're good at growing, I guess, but I'm here.
[52:01.350 --> 52:04.150]  He's going to grow soil, hydro, cocoa.
[52:04.150 --> 52:05.190]  How are you going to do that?
[52:05.190 --> 52:07.830]  The Nectar No. 8 Soil is the one we like.
[52:07.830 --> 52:11.030]  We add a little extra perlite and it's cocoa based.
[52:13.030 --> 52:20.710]  Their whole line is just all the organic things I would use in my soil, but in bottles and pH low
[52:20.710 --> 52:22.870]  so that it doesn't go bad and stuff.
[52:24.150 --> 52:25.350]  That stuff works great.
[52:25.350 --> 52:28.550]  Half the time, me and Steve can't even tell the difference between our weeds.
[52:28.550 --> 52:29.110]  Sweet.
[52:29.110 --> 52:34.470]  They have different overtones and stuff, but I'm very impressed with the Nectar for the
[52:34.470 --> 52:35.110]  God's Line.
[52:35.670 --> 52:36.550]  I'm an organics guy.
[52:36.550 --> 52:37.910]  I don't like any lines, really.
[52:39.030 --> 52:39.750]  I understand that.
[52:39.750 --> 52:43.990]  I have a friend named Sean who's been on the podcast a lot of times who doesn't use any
[52:43.990 --> 52:44.470]  bottles.
[52:44.470 --> 52:46.070]  Nothing he's using comes from a bottle.
[52:46.070 --> 52:47.190]  That's where I am.
[52:47.190 --> 52:48.630]  His product is definitely...
[52:48.630 --> 52:50.230]  You can tell that it's a different product.
[52:50.230 --> 52:50.790]  It's cleaner.
[52:50.790 --> 52:51.430]  It burns better.
[52:51.430 --> 52:53.270]  The ashes are as white as his parchment paper.
[52:53.270 --> 52:54.710]  I love the fishbone meal.
[52:54.710 --> 52:54.950]  Yeah.
[52:54.950 --> 52:55.590]  Fishbone meal is great.
[52:55.590 --> 52:56.710]  He's all about fish.
[52:56.710 --> 53:01.750]  He's got the fishbone meal bottle and it's just fishbone meal diluted into water and I
[53:01.750 --> 53:02.630]  fucking love it.
[53:02.630 --> 53:03.750]  Yeah, that stuff's awesome.
[53:03.750 --> 53:03.990]  Yeah.
[53:04.630 --> 53:05.590]  Steve got me inspired.
[53:05.670 --> 53:06.310]  He went and got a beverage.
[53:06.310 --> 53:07.910]  I'm reaching for one out of the backpack here.
[53:07.910 --> 53:08.630]  I know it's in here.
[53:09.350 --> 53:10.150]  What are you looking for?
[53:10.710 --> 53:12.070]  Oh, this Dr. Pepper that's in here.
[53:12.070 --> 53:12.550]  Oh, nice.
[53:12.550 --> 53:13.910]  I've got a frosty cold Dr. Pepper.
[53:13.910 --> 53:14.550]  Oh, look at you.
[53:14.550 --> 53:15.350]  You came prepared.
[53:15.350 --> 53:18.550]  Oh, you got to come prepared to the podcast when you have no idea where you're going.
[53:22.150 --> 53:23.910]  It's like you're a little interested in what we're doing.
[53:24.470 --> 53:25.990]  The dog on the podcast.
[53:25.990 --> 53:26.230]  Right.
[53:27.270 --> 53:28.710]  You got anything to say, dog?
[53:28.710 --> 53:29.750]  What kind of food are you eating lately, bro?
[53:29.750 --> 53:30.950]  Hey, Ziggy, speak.
[53:33.030 --> 53:33.110]  No.
[53:33.110 --> 53:33.910]  He's like, no, I'm good.
[53:33.910 --> 53:35.190]  Does the dog like cannabis?
[53:35.190 --> 53:35.590]  Oh, yeah.
[53:35.590 --> 53:39.590]  It's been trim cycle and we just give the dogs the leaves, the family.
[53:39.590 --> 53:43.350]  So, you know, they're not getting high off of it or anything, but those vitamins and
[53:43.350 --> 53:44.550]  stuff, they know it's good.
[53:44.550 --> 53:45.590]  Phytonutrients.
[53:45.590 --> 53:46.550]  And it's so funny.
[53:46.550 --> 53:51.430]  They eat the leaves off and leave the stem and they'll nibble around the stem and they're
[53:51.430 --> 53:53.350]  just like, oh, we don't want that.
[53:53.350 --> 53:55.830]  But yeah, they'll clean our floors afterwards.
[53:55.830 --> 53:56.550]  They're hilarious.
[53:56.550 --> 53:57.350]  Pretty cool dogs.
[53:57.350 --> 53:58.950]  I got the brother of this dog too.
[53:58.950 --> 53:59.510]  Oh, neat.
[53:59.510 --> 53:59.750]  Yeah.
[53:59.750 --> 54:06.390]  So the black one is the mom and then this gold one over here came out of her and Steve
[54:06.390 --> 54:12.150]  got one of the all black ones and breeding dogs was an experience.
[54:12.150 --> 54:14.390]  I like breeding plants way more.
[54:14.390 --> 54:14.790]  Really?
[54:14.790 --> 54:15.110]  Okay.
[54:15.110 --> 54:18.790]  Well, my mind went somewhere really weird with that because it's much easier to get
[54:18.790 --> 54:19.830]  rid of ugly plants.
[54:21.830 --> 54:23.350]  This puppy is non-desirable.
[54:23.350 --> 54:26.230]  You can't really do what you do with a plant.
[54:26.230 --> 54:26.870]  Right.
[54:26.870 --> 54:27.670]  Yeah, you can't do that.
[54:27.670 --> 54:29.750]  At least it's frowned upon a lot.
[54:29.750 --> 54:30.550]  Yeah, right.
[54:30.550 --> 54:31.110]  Totally.
[54:31.110 --> 54:34.630]  We don't want that to happen.
[54:34.630 --> 54:36.390]  He's got the biggest smell he's had the whole podcast.
[54:39.430 --> 54:40.710]  He's like nothing.
[54:40.710 --> 54:42.870]  I don't know anything about dogs that went missing.
[54:44.390 --> 54:45.510]  One bag full of puppies.
[54:46.070 --> 54:46.630]  Oh no.
[54:46.630 --> 54:47.510]  Oh man.
[54:48.630 --> 54:50.070]  This show just got really weird.
[54:50.070 --> 54:53.830]  Let's talk about veterans and farming cannabis some more because this podcast, I was looking
[54:53.830 --> 54:54.710]  at the dates.
[54:54.710 --> 54:57.030]  This podcast, ironically, I did not plan this.
[54:57.750 --> 54:59.510]  This is going to come out on the 4th of July.
[54:59.510 --> 55:00.230]  Oh, nice.
[55:00.230 --> 55:01.030]  Perfectly timed.
[55:01.030 --> 55:01.830]  Good job.
[55:01.830 --> 55:02.230]  Awesome.
[55:02.230 --> 55:02.790]  That's great.
[55:02.790 --> 55:03.910]  Holiday podcast.
[55:03.910 --> 55:04.230]  Yeah.
[55:04.230 --> 55:07.430]  If you guys are listening, I hope you're, don't drive drunk.
[55:07.430 --> 55:07.750]  Yeah.
[55:07.750 --> 55:08.550]  That's my advice.
[55:08.550 --> 55:10.630]  If you're out there on the boat, don't boat drunk.
[55:10.630 --> 55:11.750]  Yeah, don't do that.
[55:11.750 --> 55:12.230]  Be careful.
[55:12.230 --> 55:15.670]  If you're at a state park celebrating today, be careful with your cannabis.
[55:15.670 --> 55:18.470]  And if you're listening after the 4th of July, because most people are going to wait until
[55:18.470 --> 55:20.310]  Tuesday to listen to this since Monday's a holiday.
[55:20.870 --> 55:21.590]  I hope you made it.
[55:22.790 --> 55:23.030]  Right.
[55:23.430 --> 55:25.350]  I hope everything went your way.
[55:25.350 --> 55:26.390]  Hope you're safe.
[55:26.390 --> 55:27.830]  And if things didn't, I'm fucking sorry.
[55:27.830 --> 55:28.550]  It's terrible.
[55:28.550 --> 55:31.430]  Do not light any mortar shells off your chest or head.
[55:31.430 --> 55:31.750]  Whoa.
[55:32.710 --> 55:32.870]  Yeah.
[55:32.870 --> 55:34.470]  You're talking like you've done this before.
[55:34.470 --> 55:36.230]  No, that was in the news last year.
[55:36.230 --> 55:37.830]  There was two deaths we had.
[55:37.830 --> 55:39.350]  People died from fireworks.
[55:39.350 --> 55:43.910]  One decided to light off one of those big mortars right off his chest.
[55:43.910 --> 55:48.070]  And I guess, and it just went right through his chest and out his back.
[55:48.070 --> 55:50.550]  And then one dude tried to hold his head, blew his head apart.
[55:50.550 --> 55:51.110]  Oh man.
[55:51.110 --> 55:53.990]  Chasing those likes on YouTube or views on YouTube.
[55:53.990 --> 55:54.150]  Yeah.
[55:54.150 --> 55:55.350]  And kill yourself for a few likes.
[55:55.910 --> 55:57.030]  I hope that worked.
[55:57.030 --> 55:57.750]  Man.
[55:57.750 --> 56:01.430]  And don't burn down any state parks or any of our beautiful forest fires.
[56:01.430 --> 56:01.590]  Yeah.
[56:01.590 --> 56:02.790]  Please don't do that stupidity.
[56:02.790 --> 56:04.390]  Just burn some joints down.
[56:04.390 --> 56:05.590]  Burn a lot of joints.
[56:05.590 --> 56:05.830]  Yes.
[56:05.830 --> 56:07.670]  But be careful wherever you are, wherever you're doing it.
[56:07.670 --> 56:08.390]  Burn some joints.
[56:09.110 --> 56:13.990]  Cannabis may be legal in Colorado, but there's no legal place to consume it other than your house.
[56:13.990 --> 56:14.790]  That's correct.
[56:15.830 --> 56:16.950]  What is that all about?
[56:16.950 --> 56:17.430]  Yeah.
[56:17.430 --> 56:19.590]  It's kind of, it's stupid, isn't it?
[56:19.590 --> 56:20.390]  Like there you go.
[56:20.390 --> 56:21.590]  You can smoke it somewhere.
[56:21.590 --> 56:26.230]  Here in the Springs, we have great open parks where people love to go and smoke down.
[56:26.230 --> 56:29.750]  But you know, if there's, for some reason, there's a cop up there, they'll get in trouble.
[56:29.750 --> 56:32.070]  And I don't understand that they're not bothering anyone.
[56:32.870 --> 56:33.510]  You have a plan.
[56:33.510 --> 56:34.070]  Go to jail.
[56:36.070 --> 56:41.670]  I'm a father and I don't want to be walking through the park with my daughter, enjoying
[56:41.670 --> 56:46.630]  ice cream and have to explain to her what you guys are doing when you're out there taking dabs.
[56:47.590 --> 56:51.590]  That's not your guys's conversation to introduce to my daughter's life.
[56:51.590 --> 56:54.070]  That's mine to bring up when the time is right.
[56:54.070 --> 56:55.430]  Kind of, thanks for being there.
[56:55.430 --> 56:57.670]  So now we can have that talk is my opinion.
[56:57.670 --> 56:59.110]  But not everyone's opinion.
[56:59.110 --> 56:59.430]  Yeah.
[56:59.430 --> 57:01.750]  Not everyone wants their three year old.
[57:01.750 --> 57:05.030]  I've got a 13 year old, so it's plenty time past time to have a weed talk.
[57:05.030 --> 57:06.310]  We've talked about weed a lot of times.
[57:06.310 --> 57:07.030]  She doesn't care.
[57:07.030 --> 57:09.670]  She's, oh my God, dad, that weed stinks so bad.
[57:09.670 --> 57:11.830]  I've talked about it with my seven year old.
[57:12.470 --> 57:18.070]  I mean, once she was about four, it was like, okay, look, I want to educate you on this.
[57:18.070 --> 57:21.030]  She knows not to touch it, not to get close to it.
[57:21.030 --> 57:22.790]  She stays completely away from it.
[57:23.430 --> 57:25.670]  You know, she just knows she's been educated.
[57:25.670 --> 57:26.870]  She has no desire for it.
[57:26.870 --> 57:27.910]  She knows it's medicine.
[57:27.910 --> 57:29.750]  It's not, whoa, it's fun.
[57:29.750 --> 57:30.470]  It's not like that.
[57:30.470 --> 57:31.910]  And it's like, it's medicine.
[57:31.910 --> 57:36.950]  But I don't, I just, I just don't want anybody to have to have the talk because of me.
[57:36.950 --> 57:37.670]  What's that smell?
[57:37.670 --> 57:37.910]  Yeah.
[57:37.910 --> 57:39.670]  What's that hippie guy doing over there, dad?
[57:39.670 --> 57:40.870]  He's doing drugs.
[57:41.430 --> 57:42.710]  Like, it's just going to go down.
[57:42.710 --> 57:44.470]  I just don't want to do that to our scene.
[57:44.470 --> 57:46.710]  We should respect those parks a little better.
[57:46.710 --> 57:47.110]  Right.
[57:47.110 --> 57:49.350]  And I'm a hypocrite because I took a dab at the park the other day.
[57:50.470 --> 57:51.510]  I've smoked joint in a park.
[57:51.510 --> 57:52.550]  There's nowhere to dab.
[57:52.550 --> 57:56.310]  And I live an hour away from here and my friend was nice enough to bring me lunch.
[57:56.310 --> 57:58.710]  And I thought she deserves some dabs for bringing me lunch.
[57:58.710 --> 58:01.190]  So I was like, well, let's go to that park right there.
[58:01.190 --> 58:01.350]  Yes.
[58:01.350 --> 58:03.350]  That's why we need our dab lounges around.
[58:03.350 --> 58:05.270]  And the Springs said no to those too.
[58:05.270 --> 58:06.790]  So I don't know what they're trying to do.
[58:06.790 --> 58:06.950]  Yeah.
[58:06.950 --> 58:08.390]  I miss being able to go to one.
[58:08.390 --> 58:12.150]  One of my favorite places to ever go in Springs was to go hang out at the Canyon.
[58:12.150 --> 58:13.510]  That's the first time Steve and I met.
[58:13.510 --> 58:17.270]  I was recording a podcast at the Canyon and posted that I was there and he showed up and
[58:17.270 --> 58:18.710]  brought weed for me to try.
[58:18.710 --> 58:22.710]  Arguably, if it's truly regulated like alcohol, you should be able to consume
[58:23.350 --> 58:24.950]  in a public place like a bar.
[58:24.950 --> 58:27.270]  That's the most valid argument out of all of it.
[58:27.270 --> 58:29.750]  You try to eat the officials.
[58:29.750 --> 58:31.830]  The legislation is the one that made it regulated.
[58:31.830 --> 58:32.470]  That was their idea.
[58:32.470 --> 58:33.910]  Regulate it like alcohol.
[58:33.910 --> 58:37.270]  There's an alcohol drinking establishment on every two blocks.
[58:37.270 --> 58:39.110]  If you're in Pueblo, there's one every 30 feet.
[58:40.550 --> 58:41.670]  It's terrible in Pueblo.
[58:41.670 --> 58:45.190]  So many drinking places and nowhere legal to consume cannabis.
[58:45.190 --> 58:46.070]  Except for in your house.
[58:46.070 --> 58:46.710]  In your house.
[58:46.710 --> 58:49.270]  And that's if you have permission from your landlord, if you rent.
[58:49.270 --> 58:54.470]  And how am I supposed to medicate safely on a lunch break if I don't live here?
[58:54.470 --> 58:54.870]  Right.
[58:54.870 --> 58:56.550]  Oh, well, you shouldn't be medicating anyways.
[58:56.550 --> 58:58.630]  I can't rely on showing up at your house every day.
[58:58.630 --> 58:58.950]  Can I?
[58:58.950 --> 59:02.150]  Hey, Steve, can I sit on your couch for 20 minutes, take four dabs and get out of here?
[59:02.150 --> 59:03.990]  Well, it depends on how good of friends we are.
[59:04.630 --> 59:06.070]  Yeah, I'm sure you might be able to do that.
[59:06.070 --> 59:08.790]  There's a couple guys if they need, they come through into the springs.
[59:08.790 --> 59:09.910]  It's like, yeah, come on through.
[59:09.910 --> 59:12.390]  But are they going to battle?
[59:12.390 --> 59:15.110]  No, the cattle once fell off the box.
[59:15.110 --> 59:15.990]  I saw some commotion.
[59:15.990 --> 59:17.270]  I thought they were going to battle.
[59:17.270 --> 59:19.350]  Yeah, that cat is awkward.
[59:19.350 --> 59:20.870]  All right, you guys, we've been going for about an hour.
[59:21.830 --> 59:23.750]  Most of my listeners check out about an hour.
[59:23.750 --> 59:25.750]  I really appreciate all three of you being on the show.
[59:25.750 --> 59:29.270]  Do you have anything that you want to include in the show before we start wrapping up?
[59:30.550 --> 59:32.790]  Just nothing, really.
[59:32.870 --> 59:33.990]  I think we talked about everything.
[59:33.990 --> 59:35.270]  I think we covered a lot of stuff.
[59:35.270 --> 59:39.350]  Just keep your eyes and ears open for the Colorado Veterans Collective.
[59:39.350 --> 59:44.150]  We'll be starting in about two, three months and follow us.
[59:44.950 --> 59:48.390]  Go visit our website, send us an email.
[59:48.390 --> 59:52.950]  And once that's started, there will be great things in the work.
[59:52.950 --> 59:53.590]  Yep.
[59:53.590 --> 59:57.510]  And you guys, you don't have to wait until all of their new stuff happens.
[59:57.510 --> 01:00:01.670]  If you're a veteran, you need support, you need help in any way cannabis related or not,
[01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:03.190]  reach out to Steve DeFino.
[01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:05.990]  Reach out to the Veteran Farmers Alliance on Facebook.
[01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:09.190]  You can email me, growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:10.870]  I will put you in touch with Steve.
[01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:14.070]  If you need something and you're a veteran, we will help you out.
[01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:16.710]  If you need something and you're not a veteran, we will help you out.
[01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:17.750]  We're compassionate folks.
[01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:18.230]  That's what it's all about.
[01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:21.510]  We want to put smiles on people's faces, keep everybody in a good mood.
[01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:24.470]  If you need some immediate help, if you need someone to talk to,
[01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:26.150]  whatever, you're a veteran, reach out to us.
[01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:27.030]  We'll take care of you.
[01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.590]  Absolutely.
[01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:28.630]  We're friends.
[01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:30.550]  If you're listening to this, we're your friend already.
[01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:31.430]  So reach out.
[01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:35.510]  And those listening, happy 4th of July from Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:36.230]  There you go.
[01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:37.830]  I think that's a great way to wrap this up.
[01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:38.710]  Quinton, thanks for joining me.
[01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:39.830]  Was this your first podcast?
[01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:40.550]  It was indeed.
[01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:41.190]  Thanks for joining me.
[01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.830]  You did great.
[01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:42.230]  Thank you.
[01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.950]  Wonderfully.
[01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:44.230]  You saved the fucking show.
[01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:46.550]  Steve, we're going to have you back lots of times, bro.
[01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:47.750]  Anytime you've got something.
[01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:49.190]  Oh, let's pitch the event one more time.
[01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:50.550]  Remind the people when and where.
[01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:57.990]  Oh, it's November 11th at the Dab Lounge at 1532 North Circle in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:59.270]  That's a long ways away, you guys.
[01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:02.470]  I will have Steve remind us a couple of times before that comes up.
[01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:05.910]  That's like five months away and we all consume a lot of cannabis.
[01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:06.390]  Absolutely.
[01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:10.230]  Well, we're gathering a lot of donations.
[01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:14.310]  Even John here is going to be donating a half pound of his own personal.
[01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:15.510]  Out of my medical, girl.
[01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:19.590]  Going to bring a half pound, roll some joints for these guys, give it away.
[01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:21.430]  I'm not going to take any back at the end.
[01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:23.110]  So I like that.
[01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:24.550]  Yeah, we come home with nothing.
[01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:26.070]  We give it all away.
[01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:29.190]  When Hylie Genetics has new seeds, you guys will include those.
[01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.710]  We would love to have you.
[01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:32.230]  I haven't put any seeds out for a little while.
[01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:34.230]  I'm working on it, you guys.
[01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:36.310]  I'm not the rushed breeder.
[01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:38.710]  I'm not going to hurry up and push it out just because it's in demand.
[01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:40.390]  I'm going to breed the way I do it.
[01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:42.710]  And then when they're ready, you guys will get them.
[01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.990]  Well, thank you.
[01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:45.750]  We would love to carry your product.
[01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:46.790]  And we'll get them out there.
[01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:47.750]  Absolutely.
[01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:48.710]  Your girls will have them.
[01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:51.030]  You guys will have exclusive shit that no one else has.
[01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:54.150]  We'll make something for you that's named after something you need or something.
[01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.790]  That'd be awesome.
[01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:57.350]  John, was this your first podcast, bro?
[01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:59.110]  No, I was on Tech Radio.
[01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:03.590]  The other day, awesome time and had a great time this time, too.
[01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:05.510]  You're a great podcaster.
[01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:08.310]  No, you do well.
[01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:09.030]  Okay, good.
[01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:09.670]  That's good to hear.
[01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:13.590]  I'm not a public speaker, so I guess this is going to work.
[01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:15.030]  This is just some friends talking.
[01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:18.150]  So now, I guess, is a good time to tell you that this podcast,
[01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:23.190]  within 48 hours of being published, 5,000 people will have downloaded and listened to this podcast.
[01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:24.150]  Yeah, I'm glad I didn't tell you that before.
[01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:27.270]  I'm glad they listened to us babble on.
[01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:28.390]  Oh, there's a lot of stuff.
[01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:29.190]  They love to hear us.
[01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:32.310]  They like it when we ramble, is a hashtag that's been created for the show.
[01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:35.510]  We smoked a lot of bulls before this, so a lot of dabbing happened.
[01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:36.630]  Yeah, when I show up, there's dabbing.
[01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:37.830]  Bro, thank you for being on the podcast.
[01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:38.390]  Of course, any time, Jeff.
[01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:39.110]  Appreciate it.
[01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:40.710]  All right, guys, I think we're going to wrap up the show.
[01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:43.350]  I will be back in just a couple of seconds and put a tail on this thing.
[01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:44.470]  Guys, thanks again for joining me.
[01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.870]  Thank you.
