[00:01.530 --> 00:24.400]  It's time for episode number 160 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:24.400 --> 00:25.400]  news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.400 --> 00:26.400]  That's right.
[00:26.400 --> 00:30.920]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[00:30.920 --> 00:34.920]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:34.920 --> 00:38.720]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:38.720 --> 00:39.720]  I'm your host.
[00:39.720 --> 00:40.720]  My friends call me Ross DeGiaffone.
[00:40.720 --> 00:43.120]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.120 --> 00:46.800]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:46.800 --> 00:49.560]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.560 --> 00:53.040]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.040 --> 00:55.800]  I hope everybody's having a great week.
[00:55.800 --> 00:57.800]  I've had a fairly uneventful week.
[00:57.800 --> 01:00.200]  Let's talk about one thing that happened.
[01:00.200 --> 01:01.200]  I had to go to the hospital.
[01:01.200 --> 01:03.640]  You guys had to have a little tiny, don't even worry, it's not that big a deal.
[01:03.640 --> 01:06.480]  I had a little tiny poke on my finger.
[01:06.800 --> 01:10.760]  I had a little boo-boo by my fingernail, right on my fingernail bed.
[01:10.760 --> 01:12.720]  I worked in the garden.
[01:12.720 --> 01:16.200]  I think from working in the garden, you guys, I got an infection in my fingernail bed because
[01:16.200 --> 01:20.560]  I woke up one morning and my finger was a little bit swollen, had a little kind of a
[01:20.560 --> 01:22.320]  dot, purple mark right there by my fingernail.
[01:22.320 --> 01:23.800]  I was like, oh, that might be getting infected.
[01:23.800 --> 01:24.800]  I'm going to have to keep an eye on that.
[01:24.800 --> 01:25.800]  It was a little bit swollen.
[01:25.800 --> 01:27.160]  I went throughout the day.
[01:27.160 --> 01:29.160]  By the end of the day, it was fucking swollen.
[01:29.160 --> 01:31.240]  I woke up the next day and it was puffy.
[01:31.240 --> 01:33.440]  It was huge, you guys, and it hurt like a son of a bitch.
[01:33.440 --> 01:34.440]  I had something I had to do.
[01:34.960 --> 01:36.160]  I went and did what I was doing that day.
[01:36.160 --> 01:39.600]  While I was doing it, I bumped my finger on a guardrail.
[01:39.600 --> 01:44.680]  When I hit it on the guardrail, I let out a few really prime words.
[01:44.680 --> 01:49.200]  There were children around that should have not heard what I said, but I was prompted
[01:49.200 --> 01:52.000]  to go to the hospital when I released those words.
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.280]  I went to the hospital later that evening.
[01:54.280 --> 01:58.720]  It took them about less than an hour to deal with my situation, but I was in the hospital.
[01:58.720 --> 02:01.120]  I was at the hospital for probably three hours.
[02:01.120 --> 02:02.120]  Let me talk about what happened.
[02:02.240 --> 02:08.840]  I had a little tiny infection on my ring finger on my right hand on the right side of that
[02:08.840 --> 02:10.240]  finger on the fingernail bed.
[02:10.240 --> 02:11.240]  There was a little dot of something.
[02:11.240 --> 02:12.920]  I was like, that looks funky.
[02:12.920 --> 02:15.160]  It swelled up, it swelled up, it swelled up, and it turned purple.
[02:15.160 --> 02:17.920]  It turned red and purple and it hurt like motherfucker.
[02:17.920 --> 02:19.440]  You could barely touch it without me screaming.
[02:19.440 --> 02:20.920]  I went to the emergency room.
[02:20.920 --> 02:23.040]  They're like, oh yeah, you got a little booboo, a little infection.
[02:23.040 --> 02:24.840]  We can fix this.
[02:24.840 --> 02:30.240]  What they did, they gave me a shot on the right side and the left side of my finger
[02:30.600 --> 02:33.360]  right between the first knuckle and my hand.
[02:33.360 --> 02:36.120]  You got your first knuckle where your hand bends and then your knuckle where your finger
[02:36.120 --> 02:37.120]  bends.
[02:37.120 --> 02:40.280]  They gave me a shot between those two on either side and then that numbed up the whole finger.
[02:40.280 --> 02:41.600]  It numbed up my finger.
[02:41.600 --> 02:44.960]  It numbed up most of my hand.
[02:44.960 --> 02:47.560]  All the pain was pretty much gone at that point because it didn't hurt like a son of
[02:47.560 --> 02:50.640]  a bitch until then.
[02:50.640 --> 02:54.000]  Once the numbing kicked in pretty good, the doctor came back in and he took a scalpel
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.320]  and just cut a little tiny ... He made a plus sign, just a little plus sign so that it would
[02:58.320 --> 02:59.320]  open up.
[02:59.320 --> 03:03.720]  Then when he opened it, you guys, it was just like ... I made a little pop noise.
[03:03.720 --> 03:06.960]  I don't know if the mic picked it up, but it was a ... You could hear it and you could
[03:06.960 --> 03:09.040]  feel it and all kinds of shit came out of it.
[03:09.040 --> 03:10.760]  He squeezed a bunch of stuff out of it.
[03:10.760 --> 03:13.720]  Oh, he got so much stuff out of there.
[03:13.720 --> 03:17.240]  I could feel almost as soon as he cut it open, I could feel relief.
[03:17.240 --> 03:20.160]  I could just feel the pressure just come off of my skin and off my finger.
[03:20.160 --> 03:23.260]  I was like, oh, it felt so much better.
[03:23.260 --> 03:27.360]  He stuck a bunch of gauze inside of there, a bunch of wadding to suck up all the pus
[03:27.400 --> 03:29.760]  and goo that would be coming out of my finger.
[03:29.760 --> 03:32.560]  Then he wrapped it up for a little bit, or put some medicine on there and wrapped it
[03:32.560 --> 03:33.560]  up a little bit.
[03:33.560 --> 03:35.560]  He told me to change that in 24 hours.
[03:35.560 --> 03:41.160]  24 hours later, I had to take off the wrapping that he put on it and I had to pull that gauze-y
[03:41.160 --> 03:43.280]  stuff out of my finger, you guys.
[03:43.280 --> 03:45.080]  That was one of the funkiest experiences ever.
[03:45.080 --> 03:47.120]  There was a lot of shit tucked into my finger.
[03:47.120 --> 03:48.120]  Holy crap.
[03:48.120 --> 03:49.960]  Then I put more medicine on there.
[03:49.960 --> 03:50.960]  Actually JB helped me.
[03:50.960 --> 03:52.100]  Shout out to JB for helping me do that.
[03:52.100 --> 03:55.240]  She put some medicine on my finger.
[03:56.080 --> 03:59.440]  We wrapped it up again and been going about my business.
[03:59.440 --> 04:03.560]  I've been rewrapping it and putting medicine on it about every 24 hours.
[04:03.560 --> 04:05.320]  It's looking really good now.
[04:05.320 --> 04:08.220]  Today it's been, let's see, I'm going to count days.
[04:08.220 --> 04:12.240]  It's been four or five days and it's basically fine by now.
[04:12.240 --> 04:14.000]  There's still a little bit of scabbing on there.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.200]  It doesn't bleed anymore, but they put me on these antibiotics, you guys.
[04:17.200 --> 04:19.360]  These antibiotics make me feel so terrible.
[04:19.360 --> 04:20.640]  They make me nauseous as shit.
[04:20.640 --> 04:22.280]  They give me some stomach problems.
[04:22.280 --> 04:24.160]  I don't want to be around when I take these things.
[04:24.160 --> 04:28.640]  For like two hours after I take them, I'm just miserable, but I feel much better.
[04:28.640 --> 04:29.640]  My finger doesn't hurt anymore.
[04:29.640 --> 04:32.080]  I've only got a few more of the antibiotics to take.
[04:32.080 --> 04:35.080]  This whole fucking situation will be over pretty soon.
[04:35.080 --> 04:38.140]  My guidance to you guys, wear some rubber gloves when you're working in the garden or
[04:38.140 --> 04:42.120]  be sure to wash your hands really, really well with some antibacterial soap because
[04:42.120 --> 04:43.520]  I didn't do either one of those.
[04:43.520 --> 04:46.640]  Apparently, I don't wear gloves unless I'm getting into some shit that I know is going
[04:46.640 --> 04:48.120]  to be funky.
[04:48.120 --> 04:51.640]  I'm pretty sure that working in the gardens did not help with this infection.
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  I can't blame it on gardening, but I'm like 95% sure that this funky shit under my fingernail
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.520]  came from working in the garden.
[04:59.520 --> 05:03.600]  Wear some gloves, cut your fingernails, take care of your hands.
[05:03.600 --> 05:07.320]  If you know me, I do have dreadlocks and I grow weed, but I am kind of OCD.
[05:07.320 --> 05:08.440]  I am kind of a clean dude.
[05:08.440 --> 05:10.680]  I wash my hands constantly.
[05:10.680 --> 05:12.920]  It's amazing that I'm the dude that got a fingernail infection.
[05:12.920 --> 05:15.160]  If it can happen to me, it can happen to anybody.
[05:15.160 --> 05:16.800]  You guys wash your hands, wear some gloves.
[05:16.800 --> 05:17.800]  That's my point.
[05:17.800 --> 05:18.800]  Sorry about rambling.
[05:18.800 --> 05:19.800]  The finger's fine.
[05:19.800 --> 05:20.800]  It's going to be cool.
[05:20.960 --> 05:21.960]  I was like, I'm going to cut it off because it hurts so bad.
[05:21.960 --> 05:23.320]  I was like, just cut it at the fucking knuckle, man.
[05:23.320 --> 05:24.320]  It hurts.
[05:24.320 --> 05:25.320]  They laughed at me.
[05:25.320 --> 05:26.320]  They gave me a couple shots.
[05:26.320 --> 05:27.840]  They made it sound like these shots.
[05:27.840 --> 05:29.880]  You guys, they're like, these shots really hurt.
[05:29.880 --> 05:32.760]  So please keep your hand very still.
[05:32.760 --> 05:34.960]  And the guy was like holding, the doctor was holding my hand in place.
[05:34.960 --> 05:38.080]  Like, please don't wiggle because I don't want to hurt you with this needle.
[05:38.080 --> 05:39.080]  Please stay still.
[05:39.080 --> 05:40.080]  It's going to hurt a lot.
[05:40.080 --> 05:43.080]  When he stuck that needle in me, I was like, oh dude, what, why did you hype me up on how
[05:43.080 --> 05:44.080]  bad that was going to hurt?
[05:44.080 --> 05:45.840]  Cause that didn't fucking hurt.
[05:45.840 --> 05:48.240]  Like he had, everybody had me more scared than anything.
[05:48.240 --> 05:49.240]  It was kind of weird.
[05:49.240 --> 05:50.760]  And I was like, why'd you do that to me?
[05:50.760 --> 05:53.360]  You just barely poked and kind of burns.
[05:53.360 --> 05:55.840]  It itched like I wanted to reach over and scratch it.
[05:55.840 --> 05:56.840]  Like I'm scratching my hand right now.
[05:56.840 --> 05:57.840]  Just thinking about the feeling.
[05:57.840 --> 06:00.520]  All right, you guys, I'm going to get to the point of this podcast.
[06:00.520 --> 06:03.800]  There is a point I do have a purpose today.
[06:03.800 --> 06:08.180]  It is the season you guys, it is harvest time in Colorado.
[06:08.180 --> 06:13.240]  Most of California is probably working through their harvest, but I got an email from a listener
[06:13.240 --> 06:16.080]  and he asked us, oh, this phone is trying to make me update right now.
[06:16.080 --> 06:17.080]  And I don't want to update.
[06:17.080 --> 06:18.080]  This is the worst timing ever.
[06:18.080 --> 06:19.080]  Here we go.
[06:19.120 --> 06:20.600]  This is the email that wants me to update to the new operating system.
[06:20.600 --> 06:22.480]  I'm not ready to do it.
[06:22.480 --> 06:23.480]  So here we go.
[06:23.480 --> 06:24.480]  Let me find this email.
[06:24.480 --> 06:26.880]  It says happy cropped over.
[06:26.880 --> 06:28.880]  And he says, happy cropped over Jeff.
[06:28.880 --> 06:30.440]  And then I'm going to skip his name.
[06:30.440 --> 06:31.440]  He says, my name is blank.
[06:31.440 --> 06:33.080]  And he says, I'm a long time listener.
[06:33.080 --> 06:37.640]  And if you so much of your information here legally in Michigan, could you repost your
[06:37.640 --> 06:39.000]  curing episode?
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.160]  I figured tis the season and I'm sure people could use a curing refresher.
[06:44.160 --> 06:46.840]  I'm absolutely going to give you a curing refresher.
[06:46.840 --> 06:48.320]  I'm not going to repost the old episode.
[06:48.560 --> 06:49.560]  I feel like that'd be cheap.
[06:49.560 --> 06:54.200]  I'm just going to go ahead and redo a fresh episode on how to cure your freshly harvested
[06:54.200 --> 06:58.400]  buds before I get to that, though, there is a second half to this email that was kind
[06:58.400 --> 07:01.320]  of just written to me that I don't think needs to be read on the air.
[07:01.320 --> 07:04.840]  I'll respond to the email personally, but on the air, let me say that I'm glad that
[07:04.840 --> 07:06.920]  I could be there to help you when things are rough.
[07:06.920 --> 07:08.920]  And I truly appreciate the email like this.
[07:08.920 --> 07:12.640]  And I'm sorry for your your troubles, but I'm glad that I could be there to help you
[07:12.640 --> 07:14.080]  out the little bit that I could.
[07:14.080 --> 07:15.080]  I appreciate that.
[07:15.080 --> 07:16.080]  I love the email.
[07:16.080 --> 07:17.080]  Thank you.
[07:17.080 --> 07:18.080]  So let's get to the point.
[07:18.840 --> 07:20.440]  You guys are going to tell us to do a drying and curing episode.
[07:20.440 --> 07:21.600]  You guys, my throat's already clogged up.
[07:21.600 --> 07:22.600]  I feel like I could use a dab.
[07:22.600 --> 07:23.940]  So I'm going to press pause for one second.
[07:23.940 --> 07:27.280]  I'm going to sip on some frosty cold Dr. Pepper and I'm going to take a fat dab.
[07:27.280 --> 07:31.800]  And when I get back, we're going to do a quick lesson on drying and curing your freshly harvested
[07:31.800 --> 07:32.800]  cannabis.
[07:32.800 --> 07:50.680]  All right, you guys, I am freshly medicated.
[07:50.680 --> 07:52.520]  I am freshly hydrated.
[07:52.520 --> 07:56.960]  Let's talk about drying and curing your freshly harvested cannabis.
[07:56.960 --> 07:58.000]  I'm going to back up a little bit.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  I'm going to go to something that is super important that I know I talk about a lot,
[08:01.400 --> 08:03.280]  but I find it to be really important.
[08:03.280 --> 08:08.880]  About 14, 10 to 14 days before you plan on harvesting your plants, flush your plants.
[08:08.880 --> 08:09.880]  It's free.
[08:09.880 --> 08:11.000]  All you need is clean water.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.660]  You're watering your plants anyway, or they're going to die.
[08:13.660 --> 08:15.800]  So about two weeks before harvest time.
[08:15.800 --> 08:20.120]  And if you can't predict it that well, 10 days is cool, but try to go 10 full days at
[08:20.120 --> 08:21.120]  minimum.
[08:21.120 --> 08:24.040]  I'd rather go 10 to 14, 14 is what I prefer.
[08:24.040 --> 08:25.920]  But if you're in cocoa, 10 days is plenty.
[08:25.920 --> 08:30.000]  If you're in some soil, soilless mix, you're going to want to go 14 days.
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.360]  So what you got to do the first day that you decide to flush, just fill that pot with,
[08:35.360 --> 08:38.840]  get some, if you really want to pH the water, you can, if you've got a small crop pH it,
[08:38.840 --> 08:42.440]  but if you're using a large crop, like I run seven gallon pots, so it takes a lot of water
[08:42.440 --> 08:43.440]  to flush my plants.
[08:43.440 --> 08:47.800]  I don't pH all of that water to be honest with you, to tell you the honest truth.
[08:47.800 --> 08:52.320]  So what I do, just fill up your reservoir and water your plant heavily a little more
[08:52.320 --> 08:53.320]  than usual.
[08:53.320 --> 08:55.080]  It's where you're getting a little extra runoff.
[08:55.080 --> 08:58.520]  Like if you've got saucers underneath your plants, water it until there's runoff in those
[08:58.520 --> 08:59.960]  saucers for sure.
[08:59.960 --> 09:04.160]  Like some extra more than usual, because you're trying to wash that dirt out a little bit.
[09:04.160 --> 09:09.400]  So for the next 10 to 14 days, don't feed it anything but clean water, just water.
[09:09.400 --> 09:13.200]  If you want to pH it, go ahead, but just give it water.
[09:13.200 --> 09:14.280]  Clean those plants out.
[09:14.280 --> 09:16.800]  That's going to make your plants burn better.
[09:16.800 --> 09:18.120]  They're going to smoke better.
[09:18.120 --> 09:19.120]  They'll taste better.
[09:19.120 --> 09:21.040]  Your ashes will be nice and white.
[09:21.040 --> 09:22.760]  Your joints will burn more smoothly.
[09:22.760 --> 09:27.240]  Have you ever gone to the dispensary and bought weed and he grinded up in the grinder and
[09:27.240 --> 09:30.640]  you start smoking it and your ashes burn and they're kind of black and the joint doesn't
[09:30.640 --> 09:32.880]  burn right and it tastes a little funky?
[09:32.880 --> 09:37.560]  That's because that cannabis was probably not flushed properly and it's still got funky
[09:37.560 --> 09:39.440]  shit in it that you don't really want to smoke.
[09:39.440 --> 09:42.600]  And it could have been a lot better had it been flushed.
[09:42.600 --> 09:48.040]  It also probably could have been better had it been trimmed and cured, dried and cured
[09:48.040 --> 09:49.040]  properly.
[09:49.040 --> 09:50.540]  So we're going to get to that point.
[09:50.540 --> 09:51.540]  So flush your plants.
[09:51.540 --> 09:52.540]  It's free.
[09:52.540 --> 09:56.760]  And it's so frustrating that people will spend so long on plants and then they don't flush
[09:57.280 --> 09:58.280]  properly.
[09:58.280 --> 10:02.320]  You get 14 days of not having to spend money on nutrients and it's just water.
[10:02.320 --> 10:03.700]  You're going to water anyway.
[10:03.700 --> 10:04.960]  So water heavily.
[10:04.960 --> 10:07.160]  Let them dry out when they get a little bit dry.
[10:07.160 --> 10:10.880]  You'll see them when the leaves start going warm and you can see them do it all over again.
[10:10.880 --> 10:14.080]  Water the shit out of them and do that for the next 14 days.
[10:14.080 --> 10:16.720]  Let them water them, dry them, water them, dry them.
[10:16.720 --> 10:22.320]  You should be able to get at least four good flush cycles in there like the first day,
[10:22.320 --> 10:26.960]  the big heavy one on the first day of the two week cycle, but maybe Monday, Thursday,
[10:26.960 --> 10:28.000]  Monday and Thursday.
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.120]  That's four good waters that you can get in there.
[10:30.120 --> 10:34.020]  And then I like to actually let the plants dry out a little bit before I harvest them.
[10:34.020 --> 10:37.120]  So right before you harvest, just kind of just let them chill out, let them dry a little
[10:37.120 --> 10:38.120]  bit.
[10:38.120 --> 10:39.120]  So flush your plants.
[10:39.120 --> 10:40.120]  That's super important.
[10:40.120 --> 10:44.760]  Then a few days before harvest, maybe two or three days before harvest, I like to go
[10:44.760 --> 10:49.400]  in there and take off all of the large leaves, the leaves that are just going to end up being
[10:49.400 --> 10:51.840]  thrown away or that are in the way.
[10:51.860 --> 10:55.160]  If they've got a large petiole and I can get to them and they don't have resin on them,
[10:55.160 --> 10:58.480]  I will cut those leaves off now while the plants are standing and they're healthy and
[10:58.480 --> 10:59.800]  those leaves are sticking out.
[10:59.800 --> 11:02.880]  I cut all those leaves off.
[11:02.880 --> 11:08.200]  This makes harvesting so much easier when it comes down to cutting down the entire plant.
[11:08.200 --> 11:10.960]  Then you don't have all those leaves hanging in the way.
[11:10.960 --> 11:14.000]  You've already gotten rid of them and you're a step ahead of yourself because harvest can
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.740]  get overwhelming.
[11:15.740 --> 11:20.280]  If you've got one light, if you've got four lights, if you've got 10 lights, it will get
[11:20.280 --> 11:21.280]  overwhelming.
[11:21.280 --> 11:23.720]  If you've got that one light, that one pound of weed is going to take you, if it's your
[11:23.720 --> 11:27.320]  first harvest, you're going to be sticky.
[11:27.320 --> 11:28.400]  It's going to be overwhelming.
[11:28.400 --> 11:29.720]  So cut off those extra leaves.
[11:29.720 --> 11:30.720]  They're just going to be in the way.
[11:30.720 --> 11:32.360]  They're going to end up on the floor.
[11:32.360 --> 11:36.240]  The plants are going to be just fine without those leaves for a couple of days.
[11:36.240 --> 11:40.340]  If you're one of the growers that does the extended dark period, like 24 or 48 hours
[11:40.340 --> 11:44.920]  of darkness before harvest, chop all these extra leaves off right before you do the dark
[11:44.920 --> 11:48.160]  phase and it will really increase what you're doing.
[11:48.160 --> 11:51.880]  If you don't know what I'm talking about, you guys, a lot of people, a lot of growers,
[11:51.880 --> 11:53.720]  and this is up to you and it's up to your strain.
[11:53.720 --> 11:55.560]  It's more up to the plants you're growing.
[11:55.560 --> 11:56.560]  Certain strains love it.
[11:56.560 --> 11:58.160]  Some strains fucking hate it.
[11:58.160 --> 12:01.640]  So like blueberry and flow really love it.
[12:01.640 --> 12:03.920]  Some silver haze varietal I tried it with, hated it.
[12:03.920 --> 12:05.360]  Lemon Jeffrey doesn't seem to approve it.
[12:05.360 --> 12:11.120]  So what a lot of people do, they will take a plant and 24 to 48 hours before harvest,
[12:11.120 --> 12:14.680]  they will put it in total darkness and let it sit in the darkness.
[12:15.520 --> 12:19.680]  This puts the plant on panic mode and it basically makes it finish more quickly.
[12:19.680 --> 12:20.960]  It'll kind of bulk up a little bit.
[12:20.960 --> 12:23.720]  It'll start using the last of its energy.
[12:23.720 --> 12:25.760]  What would you do if the sun didn't come up?
[12:25.760 --> 12:27.880]  You would kind of freak out.
[12:27.880 --> 12:30.420]  That plant's whole purpose in life is to reproduce.
[12:30.420 --> 12:35.280]  That plant's goal is to get pollinated, make seeds, and die so that those seeds fall on
[12:35.280 --> 12:36.480]  the ground and grow again.
[12:36.480 --> 12:38.280]  It just wants to reproduce.
[12:38.280 --> 12:42.360]  What its job is to do that is to swell up, to get bigger so that it can receive more
[12:42.360 --> 12:43.360]  pollen.
[12:43.360 --> 12:44.360]  It's freaking out.
[12:45.040 --> 12:46.040]  It's like, I'm going to die soon because I'm going to die.
[12:46.040 --> 12:48.920]  So it starts swelling up and it starts getting bigger.
[12:48.920 --> 12:52.200]  You'll get a little more density and a little more resin production.
[12:52.200 --> 12:56.080]  I'm not certain how true the resin production is, but I've seen more density.
[12:56.080 --> 12:57.280]  I've seen it happen.
[12:57.280 --> 13:01.280]  If you put it in there for like 36, 48 hours, you'll get a little production, but it's strain
[13:01.280 --> 13:02.480]  dependent.
[13:02.480 --> 13:05.640]  The more indica dominant strains will like this better.
[13:05.640 --> 13:07.300]  So take off the big leaves.
[13:07.300 --> 13:08.840]  You can throw in the dark if you want to.
[13:08.840 --> 13:09.840]  That's up to you.
[13:09.840 --> 13:10.840]  That's up to your plants.
[13:10.840 --> 13:11.840]  It's up to your situation.
[13:11.840 --> 13:14.440]  We're running that in a large cultivation facility because we're running a perpetual
[13:14.440 --> 13:15.440]  grow.
[13:15.440 --> 13:18.960]  And so we've just always got the 12-12 happening because it's easier that way.
[13:18.960 --> 13:23.020]  And I prefer the 12-12 over the 11-13 that we've talked about on the show.
[13:23.020 --> 13:28.440]  We've talked about running your lights on 11 on and 13 off because it does show a little
[13:28.440 --> 13:31.240]  better phenotypical expression in a pheno hunt.
[13:31.240 --> 13:38.120]  And it will also save you, I guess if you're running for 63 days, a nine week flower cycle,
[13:38.120 --> 13:42.640]  that's 63 hours of lights that you're going to save that you don't have to pay for electricity,
[13:42.640 --> 13:48.160]  cooling, and also your gear doesn't get used that extra time.
[13:48.160 --> 13:50.160]  So you're going to save that much mileage.
[13:50.160 --> 13:51.940]  So if you want to do that, that works too.
[13:51.940 --> 13:54.420]  So let me get back to where we are.
[13:54.420 --> 13:55.420]  Take off the big leaves.
[13:55.420 --> 13:57.500]  You don't want those in the way.
[13:57.500 --> 14:00.160]  Let the plant stay in the dark if you want to.
[14:00.160 --> 14:02.100]  Now it's time to harvest.
[14:02.100 --> 14:04.460]  So if you have little plants, you can chop down the whole thing.
[14:04.460 --> 14:08.420]  If you have larger plants, it's probably easier to cut it down in sections.
[14:08.420 --> 14:14.020]  So what I do, I honestly use a coat hanger and I will take a large plant and I will go
[14:14.020 --> 14:15.100]  from the top cola.
[14:15.100 --> 14:16.820]  I will start from the top and work my way down.
[14:16.820 --> 14:22.060]  And what I do, I go from the top and I usually try to cut off about maybe somewhere between
[14:22.060 --> 14:24.820]  eight and 12 inch long sections.
[14:24.820 --> 14:29.380]  So I'll take the top cola and I'll go down to where I can find the first little branch
[14:29.380 --> 14:31.220]  of nodes that I think will support that.
[14:31.220 --> 14:36.500]  And I cut below that to where I can use that branching as its own hanger.
[14:36.500 --> 14:40.180]  I will cut the bud and then it will hang it upside down on the coat hanger that I plan
[14:40.180 --> 14:41.180]  to use.
[14:41.180 --> 14:42.260]  And I hang that coat hanger somewhere else.
[14:42.260 --> 14:45.420]  I've got a drying area that's got little racks for a coat hanger.
[14:45.420 --> 14:47.020]  You can hang it wherever works best for you.
[14:47.020 --> 14:50.500]  We'll talk about the temperature and the humidity here in just a few minutes.
[14:50.500 --> 14:52.920]  So you cut your buds, you hang them on a coat hanger.
[14:52.920 --> 14:55.300]  You continue to work your way down the plant.
[14:55.300 --> 14:59.180]  Now you've got a couple of V's sticking off and you'll start seeing these little V's intersections.
[14:59.180 --> 15:00.180]  They'll just come naturally.
[15:00.500 --> 15:02.460]  Go down the plant, cut a couple of those.
[15:02.460 --> 15:05.300]  So you chop one, hang it up, chop another one, hang it up until you've got your hanger
[15:05.300 --> 15:06.300]  full.
[15:06.300 --> 15:08.740]  Leave plenty of space on these hangers.
[15:08.740 --> 15:13.660]  Only put, let's see, one, two, three, four, maybe put like seven or eight, maybe not a
[15:13.660 --> 15:15.900]  whole lot of stuff stuffed together on these hangers.
[15:15.900 --> 15:17.180]  You want some air flow.
[15:17.180 --> 15:19.100]  You want air to be able to get between your buds.
[15:19.100 --> 15:20.940]  That's how they're going to dry properly.
[15:20.940 --> 15:23.020]  So put them on those hangers and hang them somewhere.
[15:23.020 --> 15:26.520]  Now let's talk about where to hang the plants and then we're going to talk about wet trimming
[15:26.520 --> 15:28.860]  and dry trimming because that's what's next.
[15:28.860 --> 15:35.540]  You want to ideally hang these plants in a room that is approximately 65 to 75 degrees.
[15:35.540 --> 15:41.060]  You also want to have approximately 45 to 55% humidity in that room.
[15:41.060 --> 15:42.360]  You may need an air conditioner.
[15:42.360 --> 15:43.700]  You may need a heater.
[15:43.700 --> 15:47.620]  You may need a dehumidifier or you may need a humidifier in there.
[15:47.620 --> 15:52.420]  Those are things that you may need to properly dry and cure this product to be top shelf,
[15:52.420 --> 15:55.940]  100% grade A dried and cured cannabis.
[15:55.940 --> 15:57.900]  So you may need a dehumidifier.
[15:57.940 --> 16:00.420]  If you're in Colorado, you need a humidifier.
[16:00.420 --> 16:04.380]  It gets so dry here so quickly that our buds dry in like four days.
[16:04.380 --> 16:05.380]  People make fun of us.
[16:05.380 --> 16:08.740]  They call our dispensary weed the Colorado crunch because it is crunchy by the time it
[16:08.740 --> 16:10.300]  gets to you.
[16:10.300 --> 16:11.300]  It gets grown.
[16:11.300 --> 16:12.700]  It gets trimmed up by a trim crew.
[16:12.700 --> 16:13.700]  It gets dried and cured.
[16:13.700 --> 16:14.780]  It gets put in a bag.
[16:14.780 --> 16:15.780]  It gets sent to a dispensary.
[16:15.780 --> 16:17.620]  It gets put in a jar.
[16:17.620 --> 16:19.860]  The jar gets open and closed all day, every day.
[16:19.860 --> 16:23.220]  And by the time it gets to you guys, it is just super crunchy.
[16:23.220 --> 16:26.200]  The way to prevent that is to dry it nice and slowly.
[16:26.200 --> 16:28.080]  It will retain some of that moisture.
[16:28.080 --> 16:31.800]  It'll retain some of that stickiness and it'll still be dense and flavorful and it'll still
[16:31.800 --> 16:32.800]  burn properly.
[16:32.800 --> 16:39.160]  So you want your drying area to be 65 to 75 degrees, 45 to 55% humidity.
[16:39.160 --> 16:41.740]  We also need it dark in there.
[16:41.740 --> 16:44.000]  You want it to be dark.
[16:44.000 --> 16:45.840]  Light degrades trichomes.
[16:45.840 --> 16:47.320]  Light breaks down THC.
[16:47.320 --> 16:48.320]  Light is not what you want.
[16:48.320 --> 16:50.000]  You want it dark in there.
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.520]  Also you would like to have a fan in there, have some air circulation.
[16:53.520 --> 16:56.360]  You don't want to leave that old air sitting on the buds.
[16:56.360 --> 16:57.800]  You want to at least move the air around.
[16:57.800 --> 17:02.700]  If you can have a blower blowing air out of the room and exchanging the air, having fresh
[17:02.700 --> 17:06.040]  air coming in and old air going out, that would be ideal.
[17:06.040 --> 17:08.200]  I understand we don't all have that type of stuff.
[17:08.200 --> 17:12.360]  So if you're using a closet or whatever, make sure you open it.
[17:12.360 --> 17:17.360]  The water that comes out of your buds is water that needs to go into, that will go into the
[17:17.360 --> 17:18.360]  air.
[17:18.360 --> 17:19.360]  And that's just going to be trapped in the closet.
[17:19.360 --> 17:21.440]  You're just going to raise the humidity in your closet.
[17:21.440 --> 17:22.440]  It's got to come out of there.
[17:22.440 --> 17:24.320]  So open that door occasionally.
[17:24.320 --> 17:27.440]  The more buds you have tucked in the space, the more moisture there will be.
[17:27.440 --> 17:31.200]  The more water you fed the plants right before harvest time, the more moisture there will
[17:31.200 --> 17:32.200]  be.
[17:32.200 --> 17:34.240]  So make sure you're getting rid of the moisture in that room.
[17:34.240 --> 17:37.160]  Also a good idea, you guys, would be a carbon filter.
[17:37.160 --> 17:41.240]  If you can put a carbon filter and a blower in your drying area, it would really help
[17:41.240 --> 17:42.240]  you out.
[17:42.240 --> 17:43.760]  It would minimize the smell.
[17:43.760 --> 17:45.500]  It would help keep you discreet.
[17:45.500 --> 17:48.760]  A lot of people are going to make concentrates out of their buds.
[17:48.760 --> 17:52.480]  So a carbon filter would also help you keep dust and contaminants out of the room.
[17:52.480 --> 17:55.660]  One thing that I see a lot of people do, they actually use the hut.
[17:55.660 --> 17:59.360]  If you're growing in a hydro hut or a small room, you can use that room as your drying
[17:59.360 --> 18:00.360]  and carrying space.
[18:00.360 --> 18:01.680]  You should already have a blower in there.
[18:01.680 --> 18:04.400]  You should already have climate controls in there.
[18:04.400 --> 18:09.360]  I know people that have actually purchased specific three by three or five by five grow
[18:09.360 --> 18:13.300]  tents and they don't put a light in it, but they do put the blower up top and they put
[18:13.300 --> 18:16.920]  a little fan in there and then they just hang the plants upside down in there.
[18:17.080 --> 18:19.960]  They've got one hut that's being harvested all the time.
[18:19.960 --> 18:20.960]  They've got a perpetual grow.
[18:20.960 --> 18:25.040]  It's where like every two or four weeks, one of their huts comes down and then it goes
[18:25.040 --> 18:27.520]  into that hut, which is actually part of their flow.
[18:27.520 --> 18:30.180]  It goes into this other hut, which is their drying hut.
[18:30.180 --> 18:32.840]  So those grow huts are good for that.
[18:32.840 --> 18:35.560]  So you want a room that's very well controlled if you can.
[18:35.560 --> 18:38.400]  I understand that's not always possible for everybody.
[18:38.400 --> 18:41.460]  I said we would talk about wet trimming and dry trimming.
[18:41.460 --> 18:42.460]  You've chopped on your plant.
[18:42.460 --> 18:44.240]  You've got it on these coat hangers.
[18:44.240 --> 18:45.440]  You've got it hanging up in a place.
[18:45.440 --> 18:49.160]  Now you can decide, do I want to wet trim this stuff or do I want to dry trim it?
[18:49.160 --> 18:51.160]  There are benefits to both.
[18:51.160 --> 18:52.160]  You get super sticky.
[18:52.160 --> 18:54.880]  It makes a hell of a mess and it takes a long time to wet trim.
[18:54.880 --> 18:56.860]  I think wet trimming takes longer.
[18:56.860 --> 19:01.620]  You may be able to do a little bit neater of a trim, but in my opinion, I am better
[19:01.620 --> 19:06.080]  at a dry trim and I think it's more time efficient.
[19:06.080 --> 19:11.360]  So wet trim, take those buds that are hanging on the hanger, take them off the hanger, trim
[19:11.360 --> 19:14.440]  them up, leave them on the hanger or leave them on the stick.
[19:14.440 --> 19:15.560]  Don't cut the buds off the stick.
[19:15.560 --> 19:18.320]  Just trim up all those leaves, all those funky leaves that are sticking off.
[19:18.320 --> 19:19.480]  Trim them real close to the buds.
[19:19.480 --> 19:21.840]  When they dry, it's going to look even tighter.
[19:21.840 --> 19:25.080]  Those little tiny pieces you can't get to, those will sink into the bud.
[19:25.080 --> 19:26.080]  Those will disappear.
[19:26.080 --> 19:28.080]  When it dries up, you won't be able to tell they're there.
[19:28.080 --> 19:33.700]  Put them back on the hanger, hang them up in your dry area and leave them there until
[19:33.700 --> 19:35.240]  the sticks snap.
[19:35.240 --> 19:39.760]  Now if you want to do a dry trim, those plants that you've cut down and you've got them on
[19:39.760 --> 19:43.600]  the hanger, just leave them in your drying area until the sticks snap.
[19:43.760 --> 19:48.240]  Once the sticks snap, that's when we catch up with your wet trim and dry trim.
[19:48.240 --> 19:51.480]  So I keep saying when the sticks snap and I'm sure some people are saying what does
[19:51.480 --> 19:52.560]  that mean?
[19:52.560 --> 19:56.360]  You've got your plants, they've been cut down, they're hanging upside down, they've either
[19:56.360 --> 20:00.680]  been wet trimmed to where now you've just got beautiful branches with beautiful buds
[20:00.680 --> 20:05.720]  hanging off of them, hanging on a hanger in your climate controlled area or you've got
[20:05.720 --> 20:09.800]  these furry looking plants with just the little leaves left on them because earlier at pre-harvest
[20:09.800 --> 20:11.480]  we cut off all the big leaves.
[20:11.480 --> 20:14.960]  So you've got these plants and they've just got little fuzzy leaves, they need a haircut
[20:14.960 --> 20:16.340]  hanging off of those.
[20:16.340 --> 20:18.240]  Those are hanging up in your dry area.
[20:18.240 --> 20:22.960]  Now every about 12 hours I would recommend go to those plants and pick a branch and just
[20:22.960 --> 20:23.960]  give it a bend.
[20:23.960 --> 20:26.440]  Now at first you're going to feel those plants just bend.
[20:26.440 --> 20:28.080]  They're real flexible.
[20:28.080 --> 20:30.360]  They're not going to pop, they're not going to break, they're just going to bend and it's
[20:30.360 --> 20:31.760]  going to be real flexy.
[20:31.760 --> 20:33.640]  It's not going to cause any problems.
[20:33.640 --> 20:37.520]  Over time you'll notice that those branches become a little more brittle and a little
[20:37.520 --> 20:38.520]  harder.
[20:38.520 --> 20:42.840]  Eventually those branches are going to snap when you bend them.
[20:42.840 --> 20:45.800]  The thicker ones are going to take a little longer, the thinner ones are going to go a
[20:45.800 --> 20:46.800]  little sooner.
[20:46.800 --> 20:52.120]  So pay attention, maybe check two or three buds every time you check when it gets close.
[20:52.120 --> 20:56.200]  Don't worry too much at the beginning but once you get closer start paying more attention
[20:56.200 --> 20:58.480]  to the different sized buds.
[20:58.480 --> 21:03.600]  And then once you feel those stems pop, once you bend it and it goes click or pop or crunch,
[21:03.600 --> 21:05.600]  you will know it when you feel it the first time.
[21:05.600 --> 21:07.680]  You'll go, that's what he meant.
[21:07.680 --> 21:12.000]  That's when it is time, if you've got trimmed buds that are already trimmed, that's when
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.840]  it's time to pop those buds off of the sticks and we'll start the curing process there.
[21:16.840 --> 21:21.480]  If you have got buds that were going to be dry trimmed, now is the time to dry trim those
[21:21.480 --> 21:24.200]  and we'll talk about that a little bit.
[21:24.200 --> 21:25.320]  Dry trimming.
[21:25.320 --> 21:28.360]  You've got your buds, they're hanging on the hanger and they're a little bit furry so you
[21:28.360 --> 21:34.920]  just take a branch off the hanger and you can cut these buds off of the sticks because
[21:34.920 --> 21:38.520]  they are about to go into the curing bin so you don't have to worry about hanging
[21:38.520 --> 21:40.440]  them up anymore.
[21:40.440 --> 21:43.200]  If the buds pop, it is fine to take them off the stick.
[21:43.200 --> 21:44.200]  Yes.
[21:44.200 --> 21:46.160]  So, you've got your buds, the stems pop.
[21:46.160 --> 21:49.700]  You can take those down and if it's easier for you to trim it while it's on the stick,
[21:49.700 --> 21:50.700]  go for it.
[21:50.700 --> 21:55.080]  If it's easier for you to trim it after you cut it off the stick, go for it in my opinion.
[21:55.080 --> 21:56.640]  Although I am not your trim boss.
[21:56.640 --> 21:57.680]  This is for your garden.
[21:57.680 --> 22:00.400]  If you're working for someone else, you got to do it how they tell you.
[22:00.400 --> 22:03.360]  Follow their rules, especially if they're paying you, especially if they're getting
[22:03.360 --> 22:04.400]  you high.
[22:04.400 --> 22:05.400]  Follow their rules.
[22:05.400 --> 22:06.400]  They're the leader of that grow.
[22:06.400 --> 22:08.200]  You got to adjust to their shit.
[22:08.200 --> 22:09.200]  But check it out.
[22:09.200 --> 22:11.640]  When they come to your house to help you grow, you get to make the rules also.
[22:11.640 --> 22:12.640]  So that's how it goes.
[22:12.640 --> 22:14.080]  The leader of the grow gets to make the trim rules.
[22:14.080 --> 22:15.080]  It's their product.
[22:15.080 --> 22:16.080]  They get to make the rules.
[22:16.080 --> 22:20.280]  One thing I have not mentioned, almost this entire process, wear rubber gloves.
[22:20.280 --> 22:22.640]  I talked about that at the beginning of the show.
[22:22.640 --> 22:23.680]  Just wear rubber gloves.
[22:23.680 --> 22:25.520]  All the time when you're in the garden, put on rubber gloves.
[22:25.520 --> 22:29.320]  You don't want that shit in your hands and the plants don't want your hands on them.
[22:29.320 --> 22:30.680]  So just wear gloves.
[22:30.680 --> 22:33.320]  So now you're wearing gloves and you've got your buds and they're cut off the sticks or
[22:33.320 --> 22:36.040]  they're on the sticks and they're fairly dry.
[22:36.040 --> 22:38.440]  You can either use scissors or I use my thumbs.
[22:38.440 --> 22:43.440]  You guys, I will take basically a stick with buds on it and I will just take my thumb and
[22:43.440 --> 22:45.960]  kind of just twiddle my thumb around these buds.
[22:45.960 --> 22:49.680]  I just make a little up and down motion and I knock the leaves right off the bud without
[22:49.680 --> 22:51.600]  disturbing the bud too much.
[22:51.600 --> 22:53.760]  You'll catch on to what I mean once you do it a couple of times.
[22:53.760 --> 22:56.240]  Just hold the bud almost like a video game controller.
[22:56.240 --> 23:00.120]  Now that I'm looking at my hands and use your thumbs just to knock off the leaves, you'll
[23:00.120 --> 23:03.080]  find where the perfect angle to use your thumb.
[23:03.840 --> 23:05.760]  I have a little thumbnail in my right hand that I use so beautifully.
[23:05.760 --> 23:07.200]  I can use it even through a glove.
[23:07.200 --> 23:08.840]  Just chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.
[23:08.840 --> 23:11.840]  And the plants are fairly dry at this point and the leaves are already crispy because
[23:11.840 --> 23:16.760]  they've been hanging up for so long that you're just going ahead and knocking off those crispy
[23:16.760 --> 23:17.760]  leaves.
[23:17.760 --> 23:18.760]  It'll be really easy.
[23:18.760 --> 23:22.000]  If you need scissors, get scissors and get in there and cut off all those funky leaves.
[23:22.000 --> 23:23.400]  You'll be able to tell what needs to come off.
[23:23.400 --> 23:26.700]  You guys, you just want clean looking buds that aren't leafy.
[23:26.700 --> 23:27.960]  Please trim your buds, you guys.
[23:27.960 --> 23:31.400]  And you can save all, if you're wet trimming or dry trimming, you can save all of your
[23:31.400 --> 23:33.840]  material and you can make concentrates out of it.
[23:33.840 --> 23:38.400]  If you, I cannot recommend anybody to make their own BHO if they're not experienced,
[23:38.400 --> 23:42.840]  but if you know somebody that is a qualified expert at making butane honey oil, you can
[23:42.840 --> 23:44.260]  make some BHO.
[23:44.260 --> 23:46.160]  If you want to make bubble hash out of it, you can.
[23:46.160 --> 23:47.880]  If you want to make edibles, that's available.
[23:47.880 --> 23:50.960]  If you want to make some topicals, if you want to put it in coconut oil, you can do
[23:50.960 --> 23:52.680]  all of that with your trim.
[23:52.680 --> 23:53.680]  That is a possibility.
[23:53.680 --> 23:56.520]  So you got your dry buds, your dry trimming them with your thumb.
[23:56.520 --> 24:02.800]  Once those are dry, once those are all trimmed, I feel like the buds that we wet trimmed
[24:02.800 --> 24:08.480]  earlier that we just cut off the sticks in the last part I talked about, and these dry
[24:08.480 --> 24:11.960]  trimmed buds that we just trimmed with our thumbs, I think we're at the same point with
[24:11.960 --> 24:13.160]  those in the same story.
[24:13.160 --> 24:14.960]  So our two characters have caught up.
[24:14.960 --> 24:19.640]  Now you've got, either way, you've got a pile of beautifully trimmed, and maybe you need
[24:19.640 --> 24:24.400]  to go back and hand trim those other buds that you did before also a little bit.
[24:24.400 --> 24:26.440]  Now that they've dried, you may notice some stuff you missed.
[24:26.480 --> 24:29.920]  You may need to go back and kind of clip them up a little bit, get in there with some scissors.
[24:29.920 --> 24:35.000]  Either way, you got a pile of beautifully trimmed, perfectly grown buds right there
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.480]  just where the sticks snap.
[24:36.480 --> 24:37.480]  It's perfect.
[24:37.480 --> 24:39.680]  Now this is where the curing process actually begins.
[24:39.680 --> 24:43.440]  And I know we're 25 minutes into the episode, but I wanted to get you here properly because
[24:43.440 --> 24:47.240]  you can't get your black belt until you got all the belts in front of it.
[24:47.240 --> 24:51.360]  So now we're going to talk about curing this perfectly dried and trimmed cannabis.
[24:51.360 --> 24:53.880]  All right, you guys, I am not a scientist.
[24:53.880 --> 24:55.120]  I hope that's obvious.
[24:55.160 --> 24:58.320]  I have not referred to any notes in this whole episode, and I'm not going to pull up any
[24:58.320 --> 25:03.760]  notes to actually tell you this part about why we want to cure our cannabis.
[25:03.760 --> 25:08.680]  Here's basically my understanding of why curing slowly is important.
[25:08.680 --> 25:09.760]  Chlorophyll tastes like shit.
[25:09.760 --> 25:11.440]  That's basically the main part.
[25:11.440 --> 25:15.040]  There's another reason to it also, but mainly chlorophyll tastes like crap.
[25:15.040 --> 25:17.480]  Chlorophyll is a part of your plants that makes them green.
[25:17.480 --> 25:20.840]  We want to get rid of as much chlorophyll as we can from the buds.
[25:20.840 --> 25:22.360]  We don't want to smoke that.
[25:22.360 --> 25:27.400]  So the only way that you can get rid of chlorophyll, the only way it can evaporate is by evaporating
[25:27.400 --> 25:28.400]  with moisture.
[25:28.400 --> 25:32.680]  Moisture is the only way it can go away, but it's got to break down before it can evaporate
[25:32.680 --> 25:33.880]  with moisture.
[25:33.880 --> 25:37.920]  So it's got to happen slowly, and that's why we try to cure slowly.
[25:37.920 --> 25:44.960]  Also another thing that happens is the THC transfers from, or it changes, it transforms
[25:44.960 --> 25:48.640]  from THC to THCA is my understanding.
[25:48.960 --> 25:53.600]  By dropping a water molecule, which is what happens when the water slowly evaporates,
[25:53.600 --> 25:58.000]  it becomes much more psychoactive and much more available to us when we smoke it.
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.240]  Now, if I said that wrong, I would love to hear your correction because that is just
[26:02.240 --> 26:09.000]  off the top of my head and that is my little mental library of science of why we cure cannabis.
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.920]  Mainly, the reason I cure cannabis is because it makes it taste better, it makes it burn
[26:12.920 --> 26:17.320]  better, and it gets me higher, and it just makes it better overall.
[26:17.760 --> 26:22.240]  If you want a basic reason or a science reason, that is why we want to cure our cannabis properly
[26:22.240 --> 26:23.880]  and slowly.
[26:23.880 --> 26:27.460]  So you've got your flush phase done, you've got your pre-harvest done where you chopped
[26:27.460 --> 26:30.160]  off all those extra leaves, then we cut down the plants.
[26:30.160 --> 26:33.640]  Then we either wet trimmed them or we cut off all the leaves and now they're hanging
[26:33.640 --> 26:37.740]  up and they're pretty, or we dry trimmed them, which we let them hang for a while and they
[26:37.740 --> 26:38.800]  looked ugly as shit.
[26:38.800 --> 26:42.720]  And then when the stems cracked, but the buds were not brittle, you still want those buds
[26:42.720 --> 26:44.600]  nice and moist so they're fluffy and sticky.
[26:45.040 --> 26:47.880]  That's what we're aiming for, fluffy and sticky buds.
[26:47.880 --> 26:49.040]  That's right what we're aiming for.
[26:49.040 --> 26:53.880]  So you got those cleaned up and now we've got this pile of beautiful, whatever you grew,
[26:53.880 --> 26:56.920]  you got this beautiful pile of Lemon Jeffrey.
[26:56.920 --> 27:03.000]  It's perfectly trimmed, it's sticky, it's fluffy, the stems were popping beautifully.
[27:03.000 --> 27:04.280]  Now here's what we're going to do.
[27:04.280 --> 27:06.200]  We're going to get some glass jars.
[27:06.200 --> 27:09.520]  You want either Kerr or Ball glass jars.
[27:09.520 --> 27:11.480]  I like the larger ones with the wide mouth.
[27:11.480 --> 27:13.060]  I like those a lot.
[27:13.060 --> 27:16.700]  I like to put, just gently drop the buds into the jar.
[27:16.700 --> 27:17.700]  Don't pack them in there.
[27:17.700 --> 27:20.980]  Just drop buds into the jar, let them sit on their own.
[27:20.980 --> 27:23.400]  Fill it up about 75 to 90% of the way.
[27:23.400 --> 27:24.620]  You don't want to stuff them in there.
[27:24.620 --> 27:26.500]  You don't want it only halfway full.
[27:26.500 --> 27:29.980]  You want it like 75 to 90% of the way full.
[27:29.980 --> 27:32.920]  Then you want to put the lid on that jar and repeat.
[27:32.920 --> 27:34.160]  Put all your buds in jars.
[27:34.160 --> 27:35.520]  Just keep going until you're out.
[27:35.520 --> 27:37.220]  Hopefully you have a lot of jars.
[27:37.220 --> 27:39.460]  Hopefully you get tired of filling jars with weed.
[27:39.460 --> 27:40.700]  That's my goal for you.
[27:40.700 --> 27:42.860]  So fill all your jars with buds.
[27:43.660 --> 27:46.420]  Put those jars in a cool, dry, dark place.
[27:46.420 --> 27:49.100]  Hopefully the same environment, similar to the environment
[27:49.100 --> 27:51.300]  that we had the buds in while they were drying.
[27:51.300 --> 27:53.540]  I know they're in a jar, but we still want to keep them
[27:53.540 --> 27:55.300]  cool and dry and we want to keep them dark.
[27:55.300 --> 27:56.660]  They're still doing their thing.
[27:56.660 --> 27:58.240]  There's still science happening in there,
[27:58.240 --> 27:59.740]  so we want to keep them dark.
[27:59.740 --> 28:02.540]  Now, I'm kind of weird and I have a lot of time
[28:02.540 --> 28:04.380]  to dedicate to my buds and my projects.
[28:04.380 --> 28:05.980]  You may not be able to do this.
[28:05.980 --> 28:08.260]  This is adjustable, okay?
[28:08.260 --> 28:10.860]  I like to go back about two hours later
[28:10.860 --> 28:13.740]  and open that jar for just a couple of minutes,
[28:13.740 --> 28:15.020]  you know, like maybe five minutes.
[28:15.020 --> 28:17.520]  I want the air to move around in that jar.
[28:17.520 --> 28:20.140]  Just let it fluff around and then I close it up
[28:20.140 --> 28:22.120]  and then I'll come back about four hours later
[28:22.120 --> 28:24.540]  and do it again and then before I go to bed,
[28:24.540 --> 28:27.660]  I will actually dump out all of the buds out of the jar
[28:27.660 --> 28:30.460]  and I will rearrange them and I'll put them back in the jar
[28:30.460 --> 28:32.100]  and I'll leave the jar open for like a good,
[28:32.100 --> 28:33.820]  I don't know, three or four or four or five minutes
[28:33.820 --> 28:36.260]  because I want fresh air around that.
[28:36.260 --> 28:38.700]  I want anything that, like any stagnant spot
[28:38.700 --> 28:39.860]  where they've been pressed together,
[28:39.860 --> 28:41.260]  where they've been sweating on each other,
[28:41.260 --> 28:42.560]  I wanna give them some breathing room.
[28:42.560 --> 28:45.020]  I don't want any mold to happen inside that jar
[28:45.020 --> 28:46.360]  is what I'm getting at.
[28:46.360 --> 28:48.520]  So I'll crack it open at like two hours
[28:48.520 --> 28:50.580]  and then four hours and then six hours
[28:50.580 --> 28:52.620]  and then maybe eight hours and then I'll try to go to bed
[28:52.620 --> 28:53.780]  for a few hours and ignore it,
[28:53.780 --> 28:55.700]  but the first thing you know I'm gonna do when I wake up
[28:55.700 --> 28:58.200]  is go crack open those jars and smell them.
[28:58.200 --> 28:59.620]  And at first, they're gonna smell wet.
[28:59.620 --> 29:01.340]  They're gonna smell like damp weed.
[29:01.340 --> 29:03.840]  If you're getting like a hay smell or an ammonia smell,
[29:03.840 --> 29:05.980]  you done fucked up, it's gonna be hard to fix that.
[29:05.980 --> 29:07.220]  You left it closed for too long
[29:07.220 --> 29:08.980]  or you put it in there too early.
[29:09.020 --> 29:10.080]  So pay attention.
[29:11.060 --> 29:12.260]  You don't want it super wet.
[29:12.260 --> 29:14.460]  If it's super wet, leave it open a little longer.
[29:14.460 --> 29:17.380]  Let some of that water come out or open it more frequently.
[29:17.380 --> 29:19.860]  You do not want mold starting in there.
[29:19.860 --> 29:22.900]  So open up the jar, like I'm weird,
[29:22.900 --> 29:26.220]  so four hours, six hours, eight hours, 12 hours,
[29:26.220 --> 29:29.180]  and then start, the more it dries, the more slowly,
[29:29.180 --> 29:31.340]  the more less frequently you can open it.
[29:31.340 --> 29:33.780]  But you wanna be opening that jar once or twice a day.
[29:33.780 --> 29:35.060]  We call it burping the jar.
[29:35.060 --> 29:38.260]  So you wanna burp that jar once or twice every day.
[29:38.300 --> 29:40.860]  And then after about five to seven days,
[29:40.860 --> 29:43.260]  you're gonna notice the buds are dry,
[29:43.260 --> 29:44.480]  but they're still spongy.
[29:44.480 --> 29:46.820]  You'll squeeze them and they'll kind of compress
[29:46.820 --> 29:48.460]  and then they'll fluff back up.
[29:48.460 --> 29:49.900]  And then you'll break them open in the middle.
[29:49.900 --> 29:52.100]  There'll be a little bit of moisture still,
[29:52.100 --> 29:53.620]  but they'll smell real dank.
[29:53.620 --> 29:55.100]  They'll have a really good smell.
[29:55.100 --> 29:57.420]  And when you smoke it, it's gonna burn beautifully.
[29:57.420 --> 29:58.720]  And then keep doing that.
[29:58.720 --> 30:00.500]  Just lock them into that jar and leave it in there
[30:00.500 --> 30:02.780]  and only open it once a day after the first week.
[30:02.780 --> 30:03.620]  You know what I mean?
[30:03.620 --> 30:04.900]  Once they're getting where they're smokeable,
[30:04.900 --> 30:07.540]  just leave them in there and only open that jar once a day.
[30:07.540 --> 30:09.420]  I recommend that you take out,
[30:09.420 --> 30:11.940]  if you think you're gonna smoke, I'd be ridiculous.
[30:11.940 --> 30:13.540]  Maybe you're gonna smoke seven grams of weed a day.
[30:13.540 --> 30:15.080]  Pull out seven grams for yourself,
[30:15.080 --> 30:16.460]  put that in your head stash jar
[30:16.460 --> 30:17.880]  and leave the rest in the cure jar
[30:17.880 --> 30:19.780]  so that you can just leave it sealed up.
[30:19.780 --> 30:21.580]  And then every day or other day,
[30:21.580 --> 30:22.900]  go pull out how much you're gonna smoke
[30:22.900 --> 30:23.780]  for the next couple of days
[30:23.780 --> 30:25.540]  and leave the rest of that stuff in there to cure.
[30:25.540 --> 30:27.040]  And it's gonna be a lot better.
[30:27.040 --> 30:28.820]  So you got your buds.
[30:28.820 --> 30:32.220]  They're still damp, but they're dry-ing.
[30:32.220 --> 30:33.060]  You know what I mean?
[30:33.060 --> 30:33.880]  You want plenty of moisture in there,
[30:33.880 --> 30:36.500]  but you don't want them too moist.
[30:36.500 --> 30:38.660]  If they're juicy, you don't wanna put them in there.
[30:38.660 --> 30:40.780]  So when they're kind of, as soon as those stems pop,
[30:40.780 --> 30:41.940]  you should be cool.
[30:41.940 --> 30:44.100]  Put them in the jar, seal that jar up,
[30:44.100 --> 30:45.060]  put it in a dark place.
[30:45.060 --> 30:47.380]  And then every, just increase your timeframe
[30:47.380 --> 30:48.920]  and pay attention to those.
[30:48.920 --> 30:51.020]  If you've got multiple jars, experiment.
[30:51.020 --> 30:53.460]  Open one up every four hours and see what it's like
[30:53.460 --> 30:55.380]  and then leave a couple of them closed.
[30:55.380 --> 30:57.020]  And then, but don't go too long with it.
[30:57.020 --> 30:58.880]  You don't ever wanna go, like right away,
[30:58.880 --> 31:00.900]  I would say check them every four to six hours
[31:00.900 --> 31:02.700]  in the beginning and then increase that time
[31:02.700 --> 31:04.300]  until you can go every 12.
[31:04.300 --> 31:07.220]  It's gonna be up to you to judge how often
[31:07.220 --> 31:08.300]  your jars need to be open.
[31:08.300 --> 31:09.620]  And I'm trying to give you timeframes,
[31:09.620 --> 31:12.180]  but I don't want you to mess up your buds
[31:12.180 --> 31:13.740]  because if you have different temperatures,
[31:13.740 --> 31:16.020]  if you have different humidity problems,
[31:16.020 --> 31:19.180]  if you leave it closed too long,
[31:19.180 --> 31:21.260]  you may cause a mildew issue.
[31:21.260 --> 31:22.420]  So it's an art.
[31:22.420 --> 31:24.720]  Every art, there's some trial and error.
[31:24.720 --> 31:27.640]  Try not to fuck up and try not to make errors.
[31:27.640 --> 31:29.160]  That's my best advice to you.
[31:29.160 --> 31:30.140]  Pay attention.
[31:30.140 --> 31:31.720]  Don't be afraid to mess up a little bit,
[31:31.720 --> 31:32.860]  but don't mess up a whole bunch.
[31:32.860 --> 31:34.420]  You gotta mess up once or twice.
[31:34.420 --> 31:36.080]  You didn't learn how to ride that bike really cool
[31:36.080 --> 31:37.340]  until you crashed a couple times
[31:37.340 --> 31:38.820]  and then you learned what you could do.
[31:38.820 --> 31:42.420]  So that's my quick crash course
[31:42.420 --> 31:45.200]  on how to dry and cure your cannabis.
[31:45.200 --> 31:47.400]  I feel like once your cannabis is properly dried and cured,
[31:47.400 --> 31:49.620]  it can be stored for, I don't know,
[31:49.620 --> 31:51.900]  I've had some weed for three to six months before.
[31:51.900 --> 31:53.580]  I've stored weed for a year before.
[31:53.580 --> 31:55.080]  If you keep it in the proper conditions
[31:55.080 --> 31:56.060]  and the proper environment,
[31:56.060 --> 31:59.380]  different strains will keep for different amount of times.
[31:59.380 --> 32:01.620]  I've had some stuff that I kept in a refrigerator
[32:01.620 --> 32:03.100]  in the back for a very long time.
[32:03.100 --> 32:04.140]  It was okay.
[32:04.140 --> 32:05.560]  I remember a long time ago,
[32:05.560 --> 32:07.540]  I hid some weed for myself in a freezer
[32:07.540 --> 32:08.380]  and I forgot about it
[32:08.380 --> 32:10.820]  and I found it when I moved out of that house.
[32:10.820 --> 32:12.500]  That weed tasted really terrible.
[32:12.500 --> 32:14.340]  Putting it in the freezer did something weird to it.
[32:14.340 --> 32:15.620]  I don't know what went wrong.
[32:15.620 --> 32:17.660]  Like I said, a little bit ago, I gave a disclaimer.
[32:17.660 --> 32:18.500]  I'm not a scientist.
[32:18.500 --> 32:20.820]  I'm just a man with a whole bunch of passion for cannabis.
[32:20.820 --> 32:22.660]  That's why the show is called Grow From Your Heart.
[32:22.660 --> 32:24.580]  All right, you guys, I definitely need a dab.
[32:24.580 --> 32:26.540]  So it's time to start wrapping up the show.
[32:26.540 --> 32:29.380]  I hope you enjoyed my lesson on how to cure cannabis.
[32:29.380 --> 32:30.440]  Before I wrap up the show,
[32:30.440 --> 32:31.800]  I wanna send my love to all of the people
[32:31.800 --> 32:33.560]  affected by the Colorado wildfires
[32:33.560 --> 32:35.480]  and I also wanna send a huge thank you
[32:35.480 --> 32:38.240]  to all of the people who helped put out those fires
[32:38.240 --> 32:40.800]  and also all of the support involved in that.
[32:40.800 --> 32:42.600]  Law enforcement, people that volunteered
[32:42.600 --> 32:45.080]  bringing the firefighters water and food,
[32:45.080 --> 32:47.080]  everybody that participated in that.
[32:47.080 --> 32:48.320]  My heart goes out to all of you.
[32:48.320 --> 32:49.360]  Thank you for that.
[32:49.360 --> 32:50.840]  Also, my heart goes out to all of the people
[32:50.840 --> 32:52.320]  that lost their homes and their property
[32:52.320 --> 32:54.480]  and were affected by that.
[32:54.480 --> 32:55.680]  All right, you guys, now that the show's over,
[32:55.680 --> 32:56.520]  please go to iTunes.
[32:56.520 --> 32:57.400]  Go to the iTunes store.

[33:04.520 --> 33:06.040]  and give me what you feel I deserve.
[33:06.040 --> 33:07.520]  Five stars would be ideal, but you know what?
[33:07.520 --> 33:08.360]  I'm not gonna pander.
[33:08.360 --> 33:09.180]  I'm not gonna beg for it.

[33:39.680 --> 33:41.180]  and give your mom a hug for me.
