[00:00.000 --> 00:04.720]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community. It's time for episode 365 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:04.720 --> 00:09.440]  podcast. This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company. If you need new seeds
[00:09.440 --> 00:14.000]  for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and you can find them at
[00:14.000 --> 00:21.680]  www.dankseed.store. I like to start the episodes off by letting you know what I'm smoking. Today,
[00:21.680 --> 00:27.280]  I've been taking dabs of this Bubble Jack Full Spectrum Extract, and I love the flavor and aroma
[00:27.360 --> 00:31.680]  of this stuff. It smells like bubble gum and cotton candy. When I dab it, it goes straight
[00:31.680 --> 00:36.080]  to my head. It makes my brain go super fast. It makes my mouth go super fast. So I think this
[00:36.080 --> 00:41.360]  will be a great concentrate for smoking before a podcast. All right, before we get too deep into
[00:41.360 --> 00:46.160]  this episode, I want to give a few people a shout out. I owe a big shout out to my friend, Jake
[00:46.160 --> 00:52.000]  Jordan. I owe a shout out to Jade, and also a big shout out to Grimbold the Druid, and also a
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.960]  shout out to Tanner Martyniuk. Thanks for supporting the podcast. I really do appreciate
[00:56.960 --> 01:00.800]  all of the support. Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be another grow lesson. I have been
[01:00.800 --> 01:05.600]  doing a long series of grow lessons. I hope you have been following along. If you are interested,
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.800]  I recommend you go back to episode 351. That's where I start this long series of grow lessons.
[01:10.800 --> 01:15.040]  Start there and get caught up. If you feel like you're up to speed, welcome to the grow lessons.
[01:15.040 --> 01:19.520]  In the last two episodes, we talked about sprouting seeds. We also talked about cutting
[01:19.520 --> 01:25.120]  clones. In this episode, we're going to talk about putting those seeds and those clones into
[01:25.120 --> 01:30.880]  containers of soil or soilless mix. So let's start with the seeds. We talked about germinating in
[01:30.880 --> 01:34.880]  paper towels. I may have covered this briefly in the previous episode, but we're going to talk
[01:34.880 --> 01:39.280]  about it a little bit of a recap right here just to make sure everybody is up to speed.
[01:39.280 --> 01:44.080]  So we started a few seeds. We folded a paper towel. We soaked it. We put seeds on the paper
[01:44.080 --> 01:48.640]  towel. We folded it again to secure the seeds inside. Maybe we put that in a baggie. Maybe we
[01:48.640 --> 01:53.200]  put that in a warm place. The seeds have now sprouted. Hopefully, they've got little tiny
[01:53.200 --> 01:57.520]  tails, maybe a quarter of an inch, maybe a half inch. Hopefully, you didn't go any more than one
[01:57.520 --> 02:03.760]  inch long. Here is how I recommend planting those seedlings. I generally try to stay away from
[02:03.760 --> 02:07.600]  recommending products. Every time I recommend a product, I get emails from people saying I did
[02:07.600 --> 02:13.600]  something wrong, but I want to make this easy for everybody. So I recommend Light Warrior Soil from
[02:13.600 --> 02:19.120]  Fox Farms for your new seedlings. It is readily available. It is affordable, and it works very
[02:19.120 --> 02:24.080]  well. I'm sure other people will have other ideas and other suggestions. I am okay with that. Do
[02:24.080 --> 02:28.640]  what you're comfortable with. I recommend this product because like I said, it's available,
[02:28.640 --> 02:32.480]  it's affordable, and I know that it works. I'm not going to send people on some crazy mission
[02:32.480 --> 02:36.800]  looking for a product that's hard to find or overpriced. So we've got our medium. You can
[02:36.800 --> 02:41.760]  probably get away with one bag of Light Warrior Soil. Now we need containers to put this soil in
[02:41.760 --> 02:47.840]  to put our seedlings in. I recommend small pots for small plants. There's no reason to fill up a
[02:47.840 --> 02:52.640]  big three gallon pot and then plant a little tiny seedling in there, and then you have to water that
[02:52.640 --> 02:58.240]  entire space of soil. You have to put water and nutrients in all of that space just to water that
[02:58.240 --> 03:03.280]  plant properly. If you've got your seedling inside of a little tiny cup, you only have to water that
[03:03.280 --> 03:06.640]  much space. You don't have to waste water, you don't have to waste nutrients, and you don't have
[03:06.640 --> 03:12.640]  to waste space. A lot of new growers really like to drown seedlings in larger pots. If they put a
[03:12.640 --> 03:16.880]  seedling in a larger pot, they've got to water all of that soil. So they go and they pour an entire
[03:16.880 --> 03:21.200]  pitcher of water right on top of that three gallon pot, then that seedling gets washed away in all
[03:21.200 --> 03:25.600]  that water. Who knows where it goes sometimes. When people apply water, they do it heavily.
[03:25.600 --> 03:29.440]  The seed gets washed away, it gets lost in there. They kill the seeds, they drown,
[03:29.440 --> 03:34.080]  they fail with the seeds, they get discouraged. So I highly recommend starting with a smaller pot,
[03:34.160 --> 03:39.200]  maybe a four inch net pot, maybe a six inch net pot, maybe a four inch square pot, maybe a six
[03:39.200 --> 03:45.200]  inch circular pot, something that size. I honestly start my seedlings in a beer cup. I take a few
[03:45.200 --> 03:49.680]  beer cups, I stack them up on top of each other, then I put a drill through the bottom of them.
[03:49.680 --> 03:54.000]  I can go through about eight cups at a time, I poke one big hole through the bottom, then I'll
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.400]  do a few smaller holes on the side just to give some proper drainage. I feel like beer cups are
[03:58.400 --> 04:03.120]  the perfect size for new baby seedlings. The seedlings can sprout in there, they can get a
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.280]  good start, they can develop a good root system. And by the time they get big enough, you can just
[04:07.280 --> 04:12.320]  pot them into their three or five gallon pot and it works really well. So let's talk about actually
[04:12.320 --> 04:17.040]  putting these seedlings into, I'm going to go with the beer cup for this method. I've got my beer cup,
[04:17.040 --> 04:22.480]  I've got my light warrior soil mix. I'm going to fill my beer cup most of the way up with soil.
[04:22.480 --> 04:26.400]  I want to pack it down fairly tight. Then I'm going to fill it up with soil and leave myself
[04:26.400 --> 04:30.240]  about a quarter of an inch so that when I water, I've got plenty of room for water and it doesn't
[04:30.240 --> 04:35.280]  just run off the top of the cup. So I fill it up, I've got about a quarter inch of space left on the
[04:35.280 --> 04:42.080]  top. Then I water that soil before I even put my clone or my seedling into it. In this case, we're
[04:42.080 --> 04:46.240]  going to put a seedling in there, so I would water it. Since I'm going with the seedling, I do not use
[04:46.240 --> 04:52.240]  any nutrients at this time. I'll water it, I'll let all that water soak through the bottom. Then I take
[04:52.240 --> 04:56.880]  my pointer finger and I dig a little hole just right to the first knuckle of my finger. Then I
[04:56.880 --> 05:01.760]  put that little freshly sprouted seedling right inside that hole. If the seedling has developed a
[05:01.760 --> 05:06.880]  long tail, that taproot, if that taproot has gotten long, you need to make that be facing down and the
[05:06.880 --> 05:12.400]  seed facing up. You want the seed coming up and the taproot going down. So gently place that seed
[05:12.400 --> 05:16.960]  facing down or the taproot facing down, the seed pointing up, place that right in the dirt. Dig the
[05:16.960 --> 05:21.280]  hole as deep as you need to dig it if you've got a longer taproot. Just push your finger in there
[05:21.280 --> 05:25.840]  as long as you need to go and gently set that taproot down in there. Then you just want to put
[05:25.840 --> 05:29.520]  the dirt right over it real gently. You don't need to pack it down, just make sure that it's covered
[05:29.520 --> 05:32.960]  up to where the light's not getting to it and it is packed in there tight enough. When you water it
[05:32.960 --> 05:36.960]  the next time, that water will probably pack it just tight enough for you. You don't need to press
[05:36.960 --> 05:41.200]  it down too much at this point. You don't want to risk crushing that seedling. So if you've got a
[05:41.200 --> 05:45.200]  real short tail, just go knuckle deep, drop that little seedling right in there and bury it. If
[05:45.200 --> 05:49.600]  you've got kind of a long tail, you've got to dig a little deeper of a hole, set that tail down in
[05:49.600 --> 05:55.360]  there, and then just carefully bury that. Be really careful not to disturb that white taproot. That is
[05:55.360 --> 06:00.640]  really delicate and it's important that it is not disrupted. Now your new seedlings are basically
[06:00.640 --> 06:06.240]  potted in their cups of dirt. I would place them under a T5 light with the T5 light about 8 to 12
[06:06.240 --> 06:11.600]  inches away. I would try to keep them around 75 to 85 degrees and I would try to keep it quite humid
[06:11.600 --> 06:15.920]  around these little tiny baby plants. Now when it comes time to water these new seedlings, we have
[06:15.920 --> 06:22.320]  to be very careful for the first few days. I recommend using a sprayer to water new seedlings.
[06:22.320 --> 06:27.280]  I got a tiny one gallon pump sprayer from the local hardware store. I mix it with my whatever
[06:27.280 --> 06:32.240]  nutrient solution I'm going to use or just plain water that's been pH balanced correctly. Then I
[06:32.240 --> 06:37.440]  pump it real hard and I just spray the top soil with that water instead of pouring a heavy dose
[06:37.440 --> 06:42.400]  of water in and risking drowning those seeds or disrupting those seeds. I just spray it from the
[06:42.400 --> 06:46.880]  top. I kind of spray it at a few angles that way I get all the soil saturated and it works just like
[06:46.880 --> 06:51.280]  the morning dew would. So I feel like spraying them is really gentle and it works really well
[06:51.280 --> 06:55.920]  for new growers to not drown these plants and not flood the soil when they're starting baby
[06:55.920 --> 07:01.440]  seedlings. Now let's briefly talk about when to start feeding our seedlings. I like to start
[07:01.440 --> 07:07.280]  feeding when I see the first set of truly developed leaves. When you see the first set of five or seven
[07:07.280 --> 07:11.440]  or nine depending on what variety you're growing. When you see the first set of full leaves,
[07:11.440 --> 07:15.840]  that's when I like to start adding nutrients. Depending on your brand and your product,
[07:15.840 --> 07:20.080]  I usually recommend you start with about a quarter strength. If the bottle says to use
[07:20.080 --> 07:24.320]  40 milliliters of a certain product, I would recommend you start with 10 milliliters of that
[07:24.320 --> 07:29.280]  product. And then as that plant gets bigger and stronger and more developed, then you can increase
[07:29.280 --> 07:33.600]  your nutrient feedings to those plants. But while they're small, let's feed them lightly so we don't
[07:33.600 --> 07:38.160]  roast them. Now let's talk briefly about what to feed them. These plants need a little bit of
[07:38.160 --> 07:43.360]  nitrogen. They need a very small amount of phosphorus and a very small amount of potassium.
[07:43.360 --> 07:49.360]  Most of your basic grow nutrients will be just fine for small seedlings. I would recommend adding
[07:49.360 --> 07:54.800]  a root inoculant product, something like Mammoth Peas, something like Great White,
[07:54.800 --> 07:59.840]  something like Recharge, something like Plus Life. Any of those products will work for you.
[07:59.840 --> 08:04.240]  Do a little bit of research, find what's available in your area, find what fits your price range,
[08:04.240 --> 08:09.200]  and get the product that will work best for you. Something is better than nothing when it comes to
[08:09.200 --> 08:14.160]  root inoculants and microbes and beneficial fungus and bacteria. I highly recommend it for small
[08:14.160 --> 08:19.280]  plants and I highly recommend it throughout the entire growing process. So when your plants are
[08:19.280 --> 08:23.200]  little, they're not going to need a whole lot of nutrients, just a base nutrient. And I highly
[08:23.200 --> 08:28.400]  recommend some sort of root inoculant. They won't need CalMag probably until we transplant them into
[08:28.400 --> 08:32.880]  the next pot. If you want to add a fulvic or a humic acid, that's always good for the plants at
[08:32.880 --> 08:38.000]  all stages. But at this point, I mainly like to focus on healthy plants with strong roots. So I
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.040]  really focus on root development at this stage of the game. I'll add microbes and beneficial fungus,
[08:43.040 --> 08:47.440]  and then I'll also add carbohydrates. But at this point, like I said, I am mainly focusing
[08:47.440 --> 08:52.320]  on root development until I transplant those plants into their next pots. So we talked a
[08:52.320 --> 08:57.440]  little bit about what to feed these little babies. Let's talk about pH. For small seedlings, I like to
[08:57.440 --> 09:04.400]  keep my pH around 5.8 to 6.2. Once they get a little bit larger, I will increase the pH slowly
[09:04.400 --> 09:11.840]  and I'll move up towards 6.3 or 6.4. But for these small babies, let's stay closer to 5.8 or 6.2.
[09:12.480 --> 09:16.560]  Now really take your time increasing the amount of nutrients you give these plants,
[09:16.560 --> 09:21.360]  and also take your time increasing the pH of these plants. They need to grow. They need to
[09:21.360 --> 09:26.000]  get a root system to be able to process all of the stuff you're giving them. These little tiny
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.200]  plants don't want a lot, and you do run the risk of burning them if you overfeed them. So pay
[09:31.200 --> 09:36.800]  attention and go slow. Now after several days, these seedlings will start taking off. They'll
[09:36.800 --> 09:41.680]  start getting full-size leaves, and they will start catching up to the same size as the clones we cut.
[09:42.240 --> 09:48.160]  Once they reach that size, I consider them to be small veg plants, and I treat them just like I do
[09:48.160 --> 09:54.000]  my small veg plants. And we will talk about caring for and feeding small veg plants here in the near
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.920]  future. Next, let's talk about planting our rapid rooters. Maybe we planted some seedlings in rapid
[09:59.920 --> 10:04.320]  rooters. Maybe we cut some clones into rapid rooters and put them in a dome, and now they are
[10:04.320 --> 10:10.080]  sprouting roots, and it is time to plant them. How do we know when it is time to plant our rapid
[10:10.080 --> 10:15.200]  rooter seedlings or clones? I like to plant seedlings as soon as I see that first taproot
[10:15.200 --> 10:19.840]  coming out of the rapid rooter. I don't want to let that taproot get too long, too leggy, and too
[10:19.840 --> 10:25.360]  stretchy, so I do my best to get those into soil right away. When I cut clones in rapid rooters,
[10:25.360 --> 10:30.800]  I like to make sure they are sufficiently rooted before I try to put them into soil. Make sure your
[10:30.800 --> 10:35.520]  clones are properly hardened off. We talked about this in a previous episode. We have to expose our
[10:35.520 --> 10:41.120]  domed clones to fresh air for durations of time and extend that duration over a period of time to
[10:41.120 --> 10:45.440]  make sure the clones are ready to not be in a humidity-controlled environment. We need to get
[10:45.440 --> 10:50.240]  them used to being in our regular veg environment. So we've been hardening off our clones, and they
[10:50.240 --> 10:56.640]  show sufficient roots. What do I mean by sufficient roots? I want at least five, maybe 10 or 12 white,
[10:56.640 --> 11:00.560]  thick roots popping out of that rapid rooter. I want them to be just busting out of there and
[11:00.560 --> 11:04.400]  kind of thick. I want them to look like they're just little worms coming out looking for some
[11:04.400 --> 11:09.440]  more to go. If you've got more than five, maybe more than 12, and they start building up in there,
[11:09.440 --> 11:14.800]  you are really doing well. We want to develop a nice root system before we pot it, but there is a
[11:14.800 --> 11:20.080]  fine line between just enough and too much. If you lift that little clone up out of that tray,
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.640]  and the roots have begun wrapping around the rooter, you've gone too far. If those roots are
[11:24.640 --> 11:29.360]  hanging down inside the rooter tray and hanging into the water, we have gone too far. We want to
[11:29.360 --> 11:34.160]  get those into our soilless mix as soon as possible. I want just a little bit of dreadlocks
[11:34.160 --> 11:38.960]  just hanging out of there. Not a lot, just maybe a little tiny mop, just a little fuzzball, maybe 10
[11:38.960 --> 11:44.160]  or 20 of them just hanging out. That is prime time to pot those. I want them about a half inch to an
[11:44.160 --> 11:49.600]  inch and a half long is perfect. Now let's put these rapid rooters into our beer cup full of
[11:49.600 --> 11:54.240]  light warrior soil or whatever size pot and whatever soil mix you choose to use. Just make
[11:54.240 --> 11:58.640]  sure it's a quality soil mix with plenty of aeration, and make sure whatever size or whatever
[11:58.640 --> 12:03.040]  container you use has plenty of drainage. We don't want our plants to get muddy at the bottom,
[12:03.040 --> 12:07.360]  get stagnant water that will totally drown and destroy our roots. We'll get root rot. It will
[12:07.360 --> 12:13.360]  be a mess. It will be disgusting. So quality soil pots with good drainage, that is a requirement.
[12:13.360 --> 12:18.560]  Now, just like we did the beer cups for our small seedlings, let's fill them up with soil and leave
[12:18.560 --> 12:23.680]  ourselves about a quarter of an inch of space for water. Now, if I'm putting the seedlings in the
[12:23.680 --> 12:29.120]  rapid rooters into this soil, I most likely will not give them nutrients at this time. When I put
[12:29.120 --> 12:36.400]  the clones into the soil at this time, I do like to give them a small nutrient feeding. I use a light
[12:36.400 --> 12:40.640]  vegetative mix, about a quarter strength of whatever brand you're using. Use about a quarter
[12:40.640 --> 12:45.760]  strength of whatever they recommend. I also like to use a microbe product. Again, something like
[12:45.760 --> 12:50.640]  mammoth pea, something like great white shark, something like recharge, something like plus life
[12:50.640 --> 12:55.520]  from veg bloom, anything with beneficial fungus and bacteria that will encourage root growth will
[12:55.520 --> 13:00.960]  be great for your small plants. So we've got our light base nutrients. We've got our root inoculant.
[13:00.960 --> 13:08.240]  Let's talk about pH. I like to keep the pH for these small clones somewhere between 5.8 and 6.2.
[13:08.240 --> 13:13.360]  So we've got our base nutrients. We've got our root inoculant. We've got our solution pH. Now,
[13:13.360 --> 13:18.080]  I water that solution through my cups of soil. Just pour it right on through until it drains
[13:18.080 --> 13:22.800]  out a little bit. You want to fully saturate that new soil. Now, once it's done dripping and that
[13:22.800 --> 13:28.000]  soil is fully saturated, I will take two fingers and just gently make a little hole right in the
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.360]  center of that soil. And I go just a little bit deeper than the height of that rapid rooter. So
[13:33.360 --> 13:38.160]  if the rapid rooter is an inch tall, I go maybe an inch and one eighth or maybe an inch and a
[13:38.160 --> 13:44.720]  quarter deep. Then I get the rapid rooter out of the little tray and I set it gently inside of that
[13:44.720 --> 13:50.960]  hole. And I do my best to not disrupt any of those roots. If it's a seedling, you've probably
[13:50.960 --> 13:55.680]  only got one or two roots sticking out of that rapid rooter. You need to be very careful. Gently
[13:55.680 --> 14:01.600]  set that in the soil. Set it right inside there. Then backfill that hole really carefully over that
[14:01.600 --> 14:06.000]  rapid rooter. I like to go right over the top of it so you can never tell the rapid rooter was there
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.720]  and just a little plant is sticking up out of the soil. Be really careful if you're working with the
[14:10.720 --> 14:15.360]  seedling. That one taproot is all it's got to survive through at this point. If you're working
[14:15.360 --> 14:20.320]  with a clone, we still need to be very careful with these roots. By the way, wear rubber gloves
[14:20.320 --> 14:23.760]  when you're doing all this. I highly recommend rubber gloves whenever you're coming in contact,
[14:23.760 --> 14:26.800]  when you're putting your hands or your skin in contact with the dirt, with the roots, with the
[14:26.800 --> 14:33.040]  plants. Just try to wear rubber gloves if you can or latex gloves. Try to glove up whenever possible.
[14:33.040 --> 14:37.840]  I would still suggest watering that rapid rooter seedling with the spray bottle just like I
[14:37.840 --> 14:42.320]  recommended before until it gets nice and large, until you're confident that you're not going to
[14:42.320 --> 14:47.040]  drown it. Just water it with that spray bottle. Make sure you fully saturate the soil, but it's
[14:47.040 --> 14:51.840]  easier to not go overboard when you're spraying with a spray bottle because you can only spray
[14:51.840 --> 14:56.160]  so much at a time. If you're a new grower and you don't have a lot of experience watering plants
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.240]  and you're new at watering the clones, don't be afraid to water them with the spray bottle also.
[15:00.240 --> 15:04.720]  Just get in there and saturate that soil. Keep spraying until you feel like it's saturated,
[15:04.720 --> 15:08.720]  and then wait until it's fairly dry to water it again. You'll know when it feels real light when
[15:08.720 --> 15:12.960]  you pick it up. You'll say, oh, that needs water. Then just soak it until it's mostly saturated
[15:12.960 --> 15:17.120]  again. Eventually, you'll realize that you're spending too much time using that spray bottle
[15:17.120 --> 15:21.600]  to water the clones and you'll start using a more efficient method, but it's a great way
[15:21.600 --> 15:28.240]  to learn how to not overwater. I basically fill my cup with soil. I moisten the soil.
[15:28.240 --> 15:32.960]  I make a little hole with my fingers and I set that rapid rooter right inside of that hole really
[15:32.960 --> 15:38.720]  gently, really careful not to damage any of those new roots. Then I carefully bury that rapid rooter
[15:38.720 --> 15:44.960]  with the moist soil. Then I put that cup underneath a T5 light. Again, I like to keep that light 8 to
[15:44.960 --> 15:48.160]  12 inches above it when they're brand new like this. I don't want to scorch them. I don't want
[15:48.160 --> 15:54.160]  to burn them. Then I like to keep the temperature somewhere between 75 and 85 degrees, and I try to
[15:54.160 --> 15:59.360]  keep the room fairly humid when I have new seedlings or young plants in the room. So that is
[15:59.360 --> 16:05.760]  really quickly how I put my rapid rooter seedlings and clones into cups of soil. Let's talk next
[16:05.760 --> 16:13.120]  about putting our clones from an EZ-Cloner machine or a Botanicare Turbo Cloner into cups of soil.
[16:13.120 --> 16:18.240]  My method for potting these clones into soil starts the same as potting our seeds or potting
[16:18.240 --> 16:24.240]  our rapid rooters. I start by filling my cup or my desired container with Light Warrior or my desired
[16:24.240 --> 16:30.800]  soilless mix about a quarter inch away from the top. I then saturate that soil the same as I did
[16:30.800 --> 16:36.480]  with my other cloning method. I use about a quarter strength of my Vegetative Newt, and I like to use
[16:36.480 --> 16:44.160]  plenty of microbes. Then I adjust the pH between 5.8 and 6.2. Now when we cut these clones, I said
[16:44.160 --> 16:49.840]  to leave about an inch underneath the neoprene collar into the water getting hit by that sprayer.
[16:49.840 --> 16:54.960]  That entire inch should have roots popping out of it. We should have a nice little mop of roots
[16:54.960 --> 17:00.480]  before we try to pot these. So I've got my cup of moistened soil. I've got a well-rooted clone.
[17:00.480 --> 17:05.120]  Now I usually grab the cup with my right hand. I use the pointer finger on my left hand, and I just
[17:05.120 --> 17:10.080]  poke a hole about an inch and a half deep right into that soil. Now I may widen that hole up a
[17:10.080 --> 17:14.960]  little bit depending on the root mass coming off of that clone. If there are a lot of roots, I need
[17:14.960 --> 17:21.600]  more room. I don't want to crowd or crush the roots into that soil. I like to lower the clone down
[17:21.600 --> 17:26.320]  into the soil and let those roots spread as far as they can get. So if you've got something hanging
[17:26.320 --> 17:31.440]  off, try not to squish them. Try not to coil them. We want to encourage those roots to spread out as
[17:31.440 --> 17:37.120]  far as they can go. If you've got a lot of roots, maybe make a small cone of soil in the bottom of
[17:37.120 --> 17:41.840]  the cup, a little triangle, so that the roots can hit that triangle and spread out around that
[17:41.840 --> 17:46.160]  instead of getting into a ball. We want the roots spread out. That is really important. If we tangle
[17:46.160 --> 17:50.000]  them up, if we twist them, they'll just suffocate themselves and they will kill the plant and the
[17:50.000 --> 17:55.200]  clone will not survive at all. Now if your roots have gotten excessively long, I recommend you trim
[17:55.200 --> 18:00.240]  some off. If they're more than six or seven inches long, just go ahead and trim the bottoms of those
[18:00.240 --> 18:05.040]  roots off. Your plants will thank you for it. They won't have so much root mass twisted up in the
[18:05.040 --> 18:10.320]  bottom of that cup trying to figure out what to do. They'll just have a nice thick root mass started,
[18:10.320 --> 18:13.840]  and it works a little bit like topping your plants. You've just created more sections for
[18:13.840 --> 18:18.960]  that root zone to branch out from, so your plants will appreciate it. So you pop that clone up out
[18:18.960 --> 18:22.960]  of the Easy Cloner. You've got the neoprene disc. You take the neoprene disc off. You put that back
[18:22.960 --> 18:26.800]  in the hole so the water doesn't go spraying anywhere. You've probably got the cloner turned
[18:26.800 --> 18:31.760]  on while you're potting the clones. Then you take that clone and you just set it right inside that
[18:31.760 --> 18:36.000]  hole that you've created in the soil, but as you lower it down into there, try to spread the roots
[18:36.000 --> 18:39.200]  out. If they're just short and stubby, they're going to go the direction they want to go. If
[18:39.200 --> 18:42.880]  they're getting long enough to where you can stretch them or move them and encourage them
[18:42.880 --> 18:47.680]  which direction to go, try to make them spread out like an umbrella. We want to get them nice and far.
[18:48.320 --> 18:54.240]  If they're really long, you can put soil in the cup, lower some of the roots down into the cup,
[18:54.240 --> 18:58.560]  then sprinkle more soil on top of that, then lower more roots down into the cup,
[18:58.560 --> 19:02.960]  and then sprinkle more soil on top of that. Then, no matter how much soil you use,
[19:02.960 --> 19:08.080]  no matter how long the roots are, we need to bury that clone deep enough into this cup to give it
[19:08.080 --> 19:12.320]  some support to stand straight up. We need to get the soil tight enough around it and get it deep
[19:12.320 --> 19:17.120]  enough in there to get the clone to support itself and stand straight up, but at the same time,
[19:17.120 --> 19:22.320]  we need to not bury it so deep that we cause root rot on that short stem that is there.
[19:22.320 --> 19:27.600]  So we put one inch of it underneath the neoprene disc getting sprayed by the water. So we've got
[19:27.600 --> 19:32.560]  roots about one inch, then that neoprene disc is about a quarter of an inch deep. So I would say,
[19:32.560 --> 19:37.120]  probably plant it somewhere between one and a quarter and one and a half inches deep
[19:37.120 --> 19:41.200]  into your medium. Now we've already moistened the soil so the nutrients are in there.
[19:41.200 --> 19:46.400]  The next thing to do is to move our potted clones underneath a T5 light. Again,
[19:46.400 --> 19:52.160]  for freshly potted plants, I like to keep that T5 about eight to 12 inches away. I will lower that
[19:52.160 --> 19:56.160]  light as the plants get stronger. I just don't want to move them right under there right away
[19:56.160 --> 20:00.800]  and scorch them and burn them and give them the opportunity to stress out. For these new baby
[20:00.800 --> 20:06.800]  clones, I like to keep the temperature between 75 and 85 degrees. And I do like high humidity.
[20:06.800 --> 20:10.480]  It depends on how much airflow I've got in the room. It depends on my environment. It depends
[20:10.480 --> 20:15.120]  on the situation. If I've got plenty of airflow, if I can have air exchange, I will put higher
[20:15.120 --> 20:19.040]  humidity in the room. If I feel like there's not a lot of airflow and it will create problems,
[20:19.040 --> 20:24.560]  I will reduce the humidity accordingly. I know I keep stressing it, but the most important thing
[20:24.560 --> 20:29.200]  to think about when you are potting these clones from the Easy Cloner, from the Turbo Cloner,
[20:29.200 --> 20:34.000]  is to not let those dangly roots wrap up on themselves. Don't let them bind. Don't let them
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.640]  smother themselves. Don't let them suffocate themselves. These cloning machines can make
[20:38.640 --> 20:42.400]  roots explode. You'll look in there on day five and you won't have any roots. You'll look in there
[20:42.400 --> 20:46.240]  on day six, you'll be getting roots. You'll go away for the weekend. You'll come back over the
[20:46.240 --> 20:51.520]  weekend. On Monday, the roots are hanging down into the water. They go crazy very quickly. You
[20:51.520 --> 20:56.000]  will see what I'm talking about when you get it dialed in. Don't take those fat clones with big,
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.880]  crazy roots and kill them by suffocating them, by coiling them up in your soil.
[21:00.880 --> 21:05.200]  All right. So at this point, we have got a bunch of seedlings or a bunch of clones
[21:05.200 --> 21:10.320]  in small pots or cups. We've got them underneath T5 lights or whatever light you've got available.
[21:10.320 --> 21:15.840]  Maybe you've got an LED. Maybe you've got a small HPS, maybe a 250 or a 400. If you're using
[21:15.840 --> 21:19.840]  something larger that works, just keep it further away. Just raise it up real high.
[21:19.840 --> 21:25.360]  So we've got it under an acceptable light. We've got it in a desirable climate, which is around 75
[21:25.360 --> 21:30.160]  to 85 degrees with the appropriate humidity. Hopefully you've got somewhere between 50 and
[21:30.160 --> 21:37.040]  75% humidity for your small plants. I would suggest either 24 hours on or possibly 20 on and
[21:37.040 --> 21:43.840]  four off, or a lot of people like to do 18 hours on and six hours off for our new small plants.
[21:43.840 --> 21:48.960]  Also, I would recommend a light fan on these plants. Just a fan to keep the air moving around
[21:48.960 --> 21:54.000]  them will prevent the plants from getting leggy and stretchy. And I think it just makes tougher,
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.200]  more robust plants when you put a little breeze on them.
[21:57.200 --> 22:02.400]  So at this point, the clones are now in our small veg phase. In a very short time,
[22:02.400 --> 22:07.120]  those seedlings will catch up to what I consider the small veg phase, which is when
[22:07.120 --> 22:11.600]  they're about six inches tall and they've got a couple of nice sets of leaves and they can start
[22:11.600 --> 22:19.040]  taking small veg nutrients. I plan on doing a complete episode on small veg here in the very
[22:19.120 --> 22:24.640]  near future. That episode will include recommended light cycles for your veg plant. That episode will
[22:24.640 --> 22:29.920]  include recommended nutrient schedules for your veg plant. I'll also talk about optimal environmental
[22:29.920 --> 22:34.400]  conditions for your small veg plants. Then we'll talk about transplanting our plants into their
[22:34.400 --> 22:39.280]  finishing pots and we will consider that large veg. And then we will begin to talk about our
[22:39.280 --> 22:44.800]  large veg phase. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you are having as much fun with these grow lessons as

[23:23.760 --> 23:27.760]  how to transplant your new babies. I feel like there was not a lot of fluff or a lot of BS to
[23:27.760 --> 23:32.160]  filter through. I feel like a lot of people can learn from this one and that is the point. So
[23:32.160 --> 23:36.400]  short and sweet, right to the point. We served our purpose. I think Mike is on his way over.
[23:36.400 --> 23:41.120]  So we will record a long and rambly episode that will make up for the short episode I did today.
