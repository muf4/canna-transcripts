[00:00.000 --> 00:05.280]  Hey, what's up everybody? It's Rasta Jeff here coming to you on a snowy cold evening in Colorado. Welcome to episode
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  484 of the grow from your heart podcast
[00:08.360 --> 00:12.280]  This episode of the show is brought to you by seeds here now if you need new regular
[00:12.480 --> 00:17.880]  Feminized or auto flower seeds in your garden. I highly recommend seeds here now
[00:17.880 --> 00:19.880]  And of course you can find them at
[00:20.600 --> 00:22.600]  www.seedsherenow.com
[00:24.760 --> 00:28.840]  You know, we like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking today
[00:28.840 --> 00:34.320]  I've been taking dabs of chrome bread live batter from our friends at green dot lab
[00:34.520 --> 00:38.340]  This is a blend of triangle cush and the white on the package
[00:38.340 --> 00:43.800]  The flavor is described as petrol fresh coffee and pine that is absolutely accurate
[00:44.080 --> 00:49.280]  They could have just labeled this as fucking dank. This is delicious. This is high quality
[00:49.280 --> 00:54.200]  This is potent concentrate if you can't tell by my voice if you can't tell by my slow delivery
[00:54.200 --> 01:00.320]  I am freaking stoned as shit from this concentrate on the back of the package. It says that this product contains
[01:00.840 --> 01:06.040]  64 point three three percent THC and non detectable amounts of CBD
[01:06.040 --> 01:12.240]  I really really enjoy the stoned buzz I got from the chrome bread live batter
[01:12.240 --> 01:17.080]  So big shout out to my friends at green dot labs in this episode
[01:17.080 --> 01:21.600]  I'm going to read an email from a friend that talks about grow room safety
[01:21.600 --> 01:25.160]  But before we get there, let's do some shout outs to our friends on
[01:25.800 --> 01:31.160]  Patreon let's start off with the big grow from your heart podcast. Thank you and a shout out to our friend David

[02:23.960 --> 02:31.160]  Forward slash grow from your heart all of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen
[02:31.520 --> 02:36.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I did say that I got an email asking about grow room safety
[02:36.160 --> 02:40.640]  So let's jump right into that the email goes a lot like this
[02:40.640 --> 02:46.200]  It says yo Rasta Jeff. My name is Travis and you can feel free to use my name. Hey, thank you
[02:46.200 --> 02:49.000]  That makes that really easy. Thank you for the great email Travis
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.320]  It says I'm here in Prohibition land after being in Colorado for 13 years
[02:53.320 --> 03:00.000]  I'm not growing here again until I see a change in these knuckleheads minds about the devil's lettuce
[03:00.160 --> 03:04.600]  so we've got a friend named Travis who was in Colorado and he has moved down to
[03:05.120 --> 03:10.400]  Somewhere in Prohibition land and he doesn't want to grow and tell those knuckleheads in Prohibition land
[03:10.520 --> 03:12.920]  Change their mind about the devil's lettuce
[03:12.960 --> 03:16.840]  So he goes on to say I would like you to talk about safety in small grows
[03:17.200 --> 03:20.480]  Closets and tents in the same house in which you live
[03:21.080 --> 03:28.460]  Can you talk about electricity and fire safety and etc? Can you tell me if those automatic fire extinguishers work?
[03:28.840 --> 03:33.540]  Thank you for keeping me motivated to fight the fight then they throw up three
[03:33.800 --> 03:39.480]  Hang loose emojis and three big tree emojis. It's a big shout out to our friend Travis for the great email
[03:39.560 --> 03:41.080]  That is a great topic
[03:41.080 --> 03:44.360]  Let's talk a little bit about safety in a grow room
[03:44.680 --> 03:49.240]  One of my biggest fears when people are setting up a grow room is fire safety
[03:49.360 --> 03:55.360]  Please do not be that person on the block that burns down your house because of your grow room
[03:55.360 --> 04:01.160]  So that is a great place to start this person actually asked about electricity and fire safety
[04:01.160 --> 04:06.100]  Let's start with electrical do not attempt to overload your
[04:06.540 --> 04:12.940]  Electrical outlets in your home to make a grow space those plugins that plug into your wall
[04:12.940 --> 04:14.940]  I'm looking at one right now across from my dining area
[04:14.940 --> 04:15.980]  There's just a plug-in
[04:15.980 --> 04:20.660]  Receptacle where you'd plug in a lamp or the TV or the microwave or whatever you want to plug in right there
[04:20.660 --> 04:24.700]  You can plug some shit in you can very easily plug in a grow light right there
[04:25.180 --> 04:32.060]  To grow lights right there will flip that breaker immediately one grow light right there may work on that breaker
[04:32.060 --> 04:34.980]  I don't know. I haven't tested the breaker. I don't know the amperage
[04:34.980 --> 04:40.020]  I don't know how big of a light I'm going to plug in that creates for a possibly dangerous situation
[04:40.020 --> 04:47.360]  I should investigate how many amps are on that plug. I should investigate how old that wiring is
[04:47.360 --> 04:51.140]  I should do some investigation before I go plugging a high-voltage
[04:51.660 --> 04:57.820]  High-wattage device into that outlet and risking an electrical fire in my home. I don't care if it's a rental home
[04:57.820 --> 05:00.700]  I don't care if it's a trap house. I don't care if it's a home you're buying
[05:00.900 --> 05:05.820]  We need to respect the home because we also need to respect the neighbors and again
[05:05.820 --> 05:09.700]  Don't be that asshole burning down the house because you were trying to grow cannabis
[05:09.700 --> 05:12.760]  That does not look good for the cannabis movement in any way
[05:12.860 --> 05:15.620]  So before you try to plug in a grow light
[05:15.980 --> 05:20.540]  Simply go find the breaker box where the breakers are that control the power in your house
[05:20.540 --> 05:25.580]  Is that breaker box capable of handling the amount of power you want to run from it?
[05:25.620 --> 05:32.980]  Then are the individual breakers you plan to use capable of giving you the amount of power you want to pull is the wiring
[05:33.400 --> 05:36.940]  Capable of handling the load you want to pass through those wires
[05:37.140 --> 05:41.620]  These lights are going to be on for some people run them for 24 hours a day
[05:41.620 --> 05:44.140]  Some lighting some will run them for 20 hours a day
[05:44.140 --> 05:48.220]  Many people are going to run their lights on for 18 hours a day at minimum
[05:48.220 --> 05:52.180]  We are going to be running high-powered lighting for 12 hours a day
[05:52.180 --> 05:58.900]  That gives us a lot of opportunity to heat up those wires the receptacles the plugins every bit of it is going to get hot
[05:59.140 --> 06:01.140]  Do not start a fire
[06:01.380 --> 06:06.220]  So the first thing we need to think about is electrical capabilities. Can we handle the load?
[06:06.220 --> 06:09.780]  We are trying to pull you can probably pull one light per breaker
[06:09.940 --> 06:11.500]  Then you can add a fan to it
[06:11.500 --> 06:13.900]  Maybe a couple of blowers once you add more than that
[06:13.900 --> 06:18.980]  You may risk flipping the breakers if the breaker flips more than once or twice that is a sign
[06:18.980 --> 06:25.060]  Don't be the guy that just keeps flipping the breaker off and on you were overheating that breaker the wiring the breaker
[06:25.180 --> 06:30.620]  Everything is getting weaker as you do that. You are risking a fire every time you reset that breaker
[06:30.780 --> 06:35.860]  So if you do realize you need electrical upgrades, it is time to call a professional
[06:36.540 --> 06:43.660]  Do not please do not attempt to add electrical upgrades to your house unless you are a qualified
[06:44.100 --> 06:51.820]  Professional electrician you can cause a lot more problems than you can do good by messing with this much electricity and you can
[06:51.820 --> 06:56.540]  Kill yourself, so please be very careful playing with electricity
[06:56.860 --> 07:00.820]  Even when you do have an electrical professional add upgrades to your grow
[07:00.820 --> 07:04.000]  You still cannot overload your outlets
[07:04.100 --> 07:09.300]  Don't try to plug more shit in then it can handle know how many amps each
[07:09.500 --> 07:14.460]  Receptacle can handle know how many amps you are pulling from each device and plan accordingly
[07:14.460 --> 07:16.060]  Don't overload your shit
[07:16.060 --> 07:22.380]  If you're not able to run your grow smoothly without the TV going off in one room or when you turn on the toaster you
[07:22.380 --> 07:27.660]  Turn off a piece of equipment. You have got problems. That is too much pool. You need to make adjustments
[07:27.660 --> 07:31.100]  I also do not like extension cords in the grow
[07:31.100 --> 07:36.020]  I feel like extension cords are weak do not plug a light into an extension cord
[07:36.020 --> 07:38.540]  Do not plug an air conditioner into an extension cord
[07:38.540 --> 07:41.380]  That is your weak link in your chain of electricity
[07:41.380 --> 07:45.280]  And that is the part that is going to melt first and is going to become a fire hazard
[07:45.280 --> 07:51.620]  I do not like extension cords if you insist on using an extension cord get an extension cord that is
[07:52.340 --> 07:57.700]  Overrated for the job. I would rather have too heavy of a cord than too light of a cord
[07:57.860 --> 08:03.500]  Pick up one of those extension cords one day those orange cords if you're running a thousand watt light through it pick that bitch up
[08:03.500 --> 08:08.060]  And feel how warm it is how long do you think that's gonna last before something catches on fire?
[08:08.180 --> 08:13.260]  So I feel like I've stressed that enough do not overload your electrical outlets
[08:13.260 --> 08:18.940]  Do not overload your breaker box do not overload your wiring do not try to pull too many amps through your house
[08:18.940 --> 08:24.500]  You will risk starting a fire if you insist on having upgrades have it done by a professional
[08:24.500 --> 08:32.060]  You still cannot overload those breakers. I try to avoid extension cords when you are doing wiring think of this
[08:32.660 --> 08:35.100]  Electrical goes high water goes low
[08:35.100 --> 08:42.280]  I always try to have any sort of electrical receptacles three feet or higher off the ground if you are adding after
[08:42.500 --> 08:46.680]  Market receptacles to any sort of area why not put them up higher most of your fans
[08:46.780 --> 08:51.860]  Most of your lights all of your shit goes up high water is down low electrical up high
[08:52.100 --> 08:56.780]  This way when you spill some shit because you will spill some shit the water goes down there
[08:56.780 --> 09:01.380]  You don't get it on the electrical sockets. You've got three feet if you've got three feet of water in your room
[09:01.380 --> 09:08.300]  You've got bigger fucking problems than electricity to worry about at this point so water down low electricity up high
[09:08.300 --> 09:13.500]  Let's talk about fire. I really like to have a smoke alarm in my grow
[09:13.980 --> 09:19.940]  But I live in a legal grow state I can have plants here if I do have a fire
[09:19.940 --> 09:22.740]  I hope to get as early of a warning as possible
[09:22.740 --> 09:28.940]  I do have a fire extinguisher on the outside of my grow it is on the outside of the grow room door
[09:28.940 --> 09:32.900]  Don't put it in there because if you have a fire in there you got to go get the fire extinguisher
[09:32.900 --> 09:38.300]  And then you're already in the fire. I would rather kick open the door and start spraying that bad motherfucker
[09:38.300 --> 09:43.580]  So I've got some I'm just gonna go spraying and praying like I'm the fucking FBI and the DEA coming in so I'd rather
[09:43.580 --> 09:45.980]  Have that fire extinguisher on the outside of the room
[09:45.980 --> 09:52.020]  I like the fire alarm in my situation because I am in a legal environment again if I've got a fire
[09:52.020 --> 09:53.100]  I would like to put it out
[09:53.100 --> 09:58.100]  And I would also like to call for backup to come help me get that out to save the house if you were in any
[09:58.100 --> 10:04.020]  Illegal state you may need to rethink the idea of an alarm you may be snitching on yourself
[10:04.020 --> 10:05.540]  But that's where you've got a gamble
[10:05.540 --> 10:09.420]  Do you want to risk a fire to where you've got to call the police and rescue the house?
[10:09.420 --> 10:12.340]  Or do you just want to let that shit burn and stay out of trouble?
[10:12.340 --> 10:16.420]  You've got some thinking to do in that situation in a legal environment
[10:16.420 --> 10:21.180]  I highly recommend some sort of fire alarm smoke detectors
[10:21.180 --> 10:27.340]  And I absolutely recommend a fire extinguisher outside of the grow get a bigger fire extinguisher
[10:27.380 --> 10:33.940]  Than you suspect you will use and there's nothing wrong with learning how to use it before you have a fire go out in the backyard
[10:33.980 --> 10:39.860]  Go somewhere safe pull the pin on that thing set up a target and spray the fire extinguisher at something
[10:39.860 --> 10:42.740]  Just to feel what it's gonna feel like it's gonna have a little kick to it
[10:42.740 --> 10:46.260]  It's gonna be heavy also when the time comes if there is a fire
[10:46.260 --> 10:49.980]  and I don't want this to happen to anybody, but I would rather you be prepared and
[10:50.580 --> 10:54.820]  Have the shit you need instead of just watch a fire and sit there and shit your pants so
[10:55.380 --> 11:02.260]  When the fire does happen you're gonna be scared you're gonna be shaky you're gonna go into autopilot all this adrenaline is gonna kick in
[11:02.260 --> 11:03.460]  It's gonna be fight-or-flight
[11:03.460 --> 11:09.580]  You may need to go into autopilot and remember how to work that fire extinguisher just on fucking pure memory
[11:09.580 --> 11:13.820]  So learn how to use it now so that when the time comes you are a professional
[11:13.900 --> 11:18.300]  Now another thing this listener asked about was the auto fire extinguishers
[11:18.300 --> 11:21.620]  They sell devices for grow rooms that hang above the lights
[11:21.620 --> 11:28.300]  And if it reaches a heat point in that room this thing explodes and releases a dusty powder that is non-toxic
[11:28.540 --> 11:33.460]  And it releases that all over the grow room and that essentially suffocates the fire
[11:33.780 --> 11:35.620]  I've never seen them in action
[11:35.620 --> 11:38.340]  But I have heard stories that those things absolutely work
[11:38.340 --> 11:44.100]  And if you're not there, and you're not able to get to that fire immediately that thing will react for you
[11:44.860 --> 11:49.100]  Unfortunately the stuff inside of that fire extinguisher will basically ruin your crop
[11:49.100 --> 11:51.620]  So you've got to clean up the entire grow room and start fresh
[11:51.820 --> 11:56.460]  But you probably would have had worse results if that fire wasn't put out so early
[11:56.460 --> 11:58.580]  So those things that hang above the grow room
[11:58.580 --> 12:03.280]  It looks like just a big red school bell is kind of what it looks like and it's got a heat sensor on it
[12:03.280 --> 12:07.980]  And if it gets to a certain temperature it basically explodes and releases a dust and that dust
[12:08.340 --> 12:10.980]  Smothers the fire and you don't have a fire in the room anymore
[12:11.180 --> 12:16.020]  So from what I've seen what I have read those products do work, and they are worth the money
[12:16.220 --> 12:18.820]  So the next note that I have got is the word heat
[12:19.260 --> 12:24.860]  The equipment we are running in our grows has the potential to create a lot of heat
[12:24.860 --> 12:29.420]  The grow lights will get very hot if you are running some sort of hydro equipment
[12:29.420 --> 12:33.300]  Your pumps can get very hot a lot of air pumps can get very hot
[12:33.420 --> 12:39.140]  The air conditioner puts out a lot of warm exhaust heat if you've got one of those air conditioners
[12:39.140 --> 12:42.660]  That's on wheels with the ducting those ducts can get very hot
[12:42.660 --> 12:45.180]  I recommend you wrap those ducts in some sort of heater
[12:45.420 --> 12:50.340]  Insulation to keep that heat from getting back into the room and it keeps it right into that tube all the way out of the
[12:50.460 --> 12:56.820]  Wherever you're growing, but we are creating a lot of heat when you are building your space when you are placing your equipment
[12:56.820 --> 13:02.940]  It is very important that you are very mindful of all of the heat. Let's not melt anything
[13:03.140 --> 13:08.300]  Let's not burn anything. Let's not cause any permanent damage to whatever structure
[13:08.300 --> 13:11.700]  We decided to grow in you probably have to move out of here
[13:11.700 --> 13:15.020]  Let's do the best we can to get our security deposit back
[13:15.060 --> 13:19.620]  So, please be very mindful of the heat you are creating
[13:19.900 --> 13:27.340]  Also be very mindful of the humidity and moisture and damage with the water you are doing to your grow area
[13:27.460 --> 13:31.220]  You may not think that a little bit of water causes a big problem to a home
[13:31.340 --> 13:37.020]  But if you get a little water in some of the structural parts of the home, you can cause catastrophic damage
[13:37.020 --> 13:41.580]  So be mindful of your heat and be mindful of your water and moisture damage
[13:41.580 --> 13:42.900]  Which you are doing to the home
[13:42.900 --> 13:46.500]  If you've got too much humidity in the same room, you can start creating mold
[13:46.500 --> 13:50.500]  If you've got too much water on the floor, you can start getting water underneath the walls
[13:50.500 --> 13:52.620]  You can get water in the framework of the house
[13:52.620 --> 13:59.460]  It can get disastrous quite quickly houses have to be condemned and rebuilt because of grows that have destroyed the homes
[13:59.460 --> 14:01.980]  So, please be very careful with that sort of stuff
[14:01.980 --> 14:08.140]  Be respectful if you are renting a home if you own the home be extra respectful because that's your shit you're paying for it
[14:08.140 --> 14:14.740]  You work super hard take care of things. So be mindful of heat be mindful of water be mindful of drainage
[14:14.940 --> 14:22.220]  Let's not start a fire and let's not flood anything now. I'm gonna start working my way into basically personal safety things
[14:22.580 --> 14:26.500]  what is something that drives me crazy that I see in a grow quite often is I
[14:27.220 --> 14:32.060]  Safety people don't wear protective eyewear in a grow room that is filled with
[14:32.460 --> 14:37.020]  Stakes if you're using bamboo sticks or those green sticks to support your plants in a grow room
[14:37.020 --> 14:40.300]  I strongly recommend you get some eye protection
[14:40.300 --> 14:42.300]  I really don't recommend
[14:42.620 --> 14:48.460]  Stakes in a grow room unless that's your only option if you're running two or three plants and you only need a few sticks
[14:48.460 --> 14:49.500]  That's okay
[14:49.500 --> 14:52.620]  But they are very dangerous for eye pokes
[14:52.620 --> 14:57.580]  Imagine you've got a stick poking up out of the plant. You want to reach into that plant do a little defoliation
[14:57.580 --> 15:02.380]  You don't even see that stick if you're looking straight at it because it's so thin you just lean right into it and it
[15:02.380 --> 15:05.180]  Goes right into your eyeball and what else do you get in your eyeball?
[15:05.260 --> 15:12.380]  Probably some trichomes, but also you get anything that has been spray applied to those plants directly into your eyeball
[15:12.380 --> 15:16.660]  So not only do you got a little poke you also got some whatever some evergreen pesticides
[15:16.660 --> 15:20.000]  Maybe you sprayed some push on there. So you got a bunch of funk in your eyeball
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.560]  It's gonna burn you're risking an infection. You're risking permanent damage
[15:23.560 --> 15:29.960]  So let's be more safe and more careful and more mindful of eye protection in the grow environment
[15:29.960 --> 15:35.260]  There are stakes in there. There are sprays that are happening in there. We can definitely damage our eyes
[15:35.260 --> 15:42.680]  I highly recommend some sort of method 7 or similar protective eyewear if you were around high-intensity
[15:43.320 --> 15:46.320]  Discharge lighting for a continued period of time
[15:46.320 --> 15:54.320]  We need some sort of glasses that will protect our eyes from that high-intensity lighting and that ridiculous spectrum something like method 7s or something
[15:54.320 --> 15:58.300]  Similar will work for you. I've had a couple of pair of method 7s that I really enjoyed
[15:58.300 --> 16:03.840]  They make them in cool styles and shapes. It'll fit your face better. Now. I definitely recommend protecting your eyes
[16:03.840 --> 16:06.240]  I have been in the grow industry for quite a while
[16:06.240 --> 16:11.200]  I've noticed now that when I walk out of a large facility if I'm in a hundred light facility for an eight-hour day
[16:11.200 --> 16:14.160]  And it's dark like right now. We're in the winter
[16:14.160 --> 16:18.120]  So when I walk out of a growth, it's five o'clock. It's dark. I've been in the grow all day
[16:18.120 --> 16:19.560]  I walk outside. It's dark
[16:19.560 --> 16:24.160]  I have to stand there for a couple of minutes and let my eyes adjust before I can even get to the car
[16:24.400 --> 16:28.680]  Because I don't want to drive with that weird eye fucked up spectrum
[16:28.680 --> 16:32.140]  I feel like my eyes are literally sunburned from being in there all day
[16:32.140 --> 16:36.940]  So make sure you wear good glasses when you're in the grow as I'm getting older
[16:36.940 --> 16:39.440]  I am noticing more of the damage that the grow lights have done
[16:39.440 --> 16:44.200]  I'm starting to notice that my night driving is affected by the damage from the grow light
[16:44.200 --> 16:48.880]  So, please take care of your eyes. I have a good friend named Jamie who taught me years ago
[16:48.880 --> 16:52.440]  He said your eyes are the most vulnerable parts of your body
[16:52.440 --> 16:57.100]  Which are exposed to the elements and they're also one of the things you use the most
[16:57.100 --> 16:59.800]  So he taught me to take good care of my eyes
[16:59.800 --> 17:02.000]  I wish I would have listened to better when I was a kid
[17:02.080 --> 17:06.720]  But again, I was a kid so take care of your eyes in the grow room
[17:06.720 --> 17:10.160]  Please take care of your eyes around the stakes. Those stakes are dangerous
[17:10.440 --> 17:17.640]  Absolutely wear protective eyewear when you were applying pesticides and also I recommend some sort of eyewear for
[17:17.680 --> 17:23.620]  The light spectrum which you were exposing yourself to for hours on end every single day
[17:23.640 --> 17:30.740]  It may sound crazy, but I also recommend that you wear protective eyewear when you were mixing nutrients or pesticides
[17:30.800 --> 17:36.400]  Not only when you spray but when you are mixing I recommend you put on gloves and protective eyewear
[17:36.800 --> 17:43.640]  Before you reach into the nutrient cupboard to pull nutrients out before you reach into the cabinet to get a pesticide put on your gloves
[17:43.640 --> 17:45.440]  and protective eyewear
[17:45.440 --> 17:50.880]  Quite often we work with other people or sometimes we are stoned and lazy and forgetful ourselves
[17:50.880 --> 17:54.360]  And maybe we don't screw the lid on a bottle completely
[17:54.720 --> 17:59.640]  Sometimes you'll pick up a bottle and that lids not all the way on and maybe you'll give it a shake and now you've got
[17:59.800 --> 18:03.840]  Pesticide all over you maybe now you've got a nutrient all over you
[18:03.840 --> 18:07.120]  But luckily you were wearing gloves and you were wearing eyewear
[18:07.120 --> 18:09.560]  So now you're not blind and you're gonna live through it
[18:09.560 --> 18:12.120]  all you got to do is take a shower and change clothes or
[18:12.560 --> 18:16.280]  sometimes maybe you've got a five gallon bucket of water mixed up and you pour your
[18:16.600 --> 18:20.800]  container with nutrients into your little measuring device and then you go to pour your
[18:21.120 --> 18:27.080]  40 mils of liquid karma into your five gallon bucket and as it hits the water it splashes and you're watching it go into there
[18:27.080 --> 18:33.360]  So it splashes directly into your eye. Now. You've got nutrient mix nutrient solution in your eyeball
[18:33.360 --> 18:37.920]  You got recharge you got liquid karma in there. You got some base news. You got cow mag in your eyeball
[18:38.360 --> 18:41.720]  That can't be good for you. No matter how much of it you got in there
[18:41.720 --> 18:46.960]  It's not supposed to be there if you were wearing some protective eyewear. Guess what? That shit would not have happened
[18:46.960 --> 18:53.640]  So I recommend protective eyewear during the mixing and anytime you're grabbing a bottle you should have some eyewear
[18:53.640 --> 18:55.640]  You should have some gloves. I know that sounds excessive
[18:55.920 --> 19:01.040]  But once you get some shit in your eye, you'll go. Oh, I could have prevented this and that's absolutely correct
[19:01.040 --> 19:06.840]  So I wear eye protection gloves personal protective equipment at all times
[19:06.840 --> 19:14.060]  I highly recommend eyewear gloves and proper shoes. I know I'm a big old hippie, too
[19:14.060 --> 19:15.440]  I love to run around barefoot
[19:15.440 --> 19:19.800]  But please wear shoes in your grow environment for the first reason is
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.480]  Because I just don't want you to fuck up your fancy little toes
[19:22.480 --> 19:26.080]  You don't want to break your toes while you're working. You want the grow room to be enjoyable
[19:26.080 --> 19:30.400]  Don't bust a toe on something the second reason what if you drop some scissors on there?
[19:30.400 --> 19:33.480]  But if you drop something sharp on your little toes ease that's not gonna be fun
[19:33.520 --> 19:40.360]  My next reason is we apply pesticides in our grow rooms those pesticides land on the floor. You can't stop it
[19:40.360 --> 19:43.580]  They're going to get on the floor. That's the bottom. That's where it's gonna go eventually
[19:43.960 --> 19:48.280]  Then you're gonna walk around barefoot the bottoms of your feet are one of the most
[19:48.680 --> 19:52.840]  Sensitive and most vulnerable spots for pesticide absorption
[19:52.840 --> 19:58.800]  So if you want to spray a pesticide into someone's body their feet their armpits and their genitals are the most easily
[19:59.120 --> 20:01.640]  Absorbable spots for something to get into your body
[20:01.640 --> 20:08.080]  So don't walk around in the grow room barefoot because you're basically working like a mop you're walking around there picking up any spilled
[20:08.240 --> 20:12.500]  Nutrients and any dropped pesticides with your feet and absorbing it into your body
[20:12.500 --> 20:18.960]  So please wear proper footwear in the grow room wear something that will cover your toes and keep you protected
[20:18.960 --> 20:22.920]  Now I shouldn't have to say this but you stoners need to be careful with scissors
[20:22.920 --> 20:25.480]  I see so many trimmers cut themselves
[20:25.480 --> 20:32.080]  I see so many experienced professional growers going way too fast and cutting themselves by doing stupid shit
[20:32.080 --> 20:36.000]  I know we are in a hurry. We've got a lot of work to do but slow down
[20:36.680 --> 20:38.520]  Safety first if you cut yourself
[20:38.520 --> 20:43.560]  You're gonna be even slower for the rest of the day and I've got to take you to the hospital to get stitches and I've
[20:43.560 --> 20:49.200]  Got to fill out a goddamn incident report. So please be more careful with your knives and your scissors
[20:49.200 --> 20:51.040]  I understand we're in a hurry
[20:51.040 --> 20:57.040]  Don't get cut dude and that goes for any tool we are using in the grow room and any equipment we are using in the
[20:57.040 --> 20:59.680]  Grow room understand and respect what you're using
[20:59.680 --> 21:03.880]  I see some people say I know how to do that and they pick up a piece of gear and I go, bro
[21:04.240 --> 21:08.440]  You obviously don't know how to do that. Quit trying to be Superman
[21:08.440 --> 21:12.840]  Let's take a minute and properly train you before you hurt yourself and the other people in this grow
[21:12.920 --> 21:17.160]  So understand and respect any tools and equipment that you were using
[21:17.680 --> 21:22.760]  Keep in mind that in a grow room. There are a lot of moving parts. We've got blowers
[21:22.760 --> 21:27.880]  We've got fans and we've got air conditioners. We've got a lot of operating parts
[21:27.880 --> 21:32.280]  I don't know what kind of grill you were operating. I don't know where you are. I know there are moving parts in many grows
[21:33.200 --> 21:37.120]  Keep your fingers and your hands out of any dangerous spaces
[21:37.480 --> 21:40.920]  That should be obvious but a lot of people seem to forget about that shit
[21:40.920 --> 21:42.800]  We get stoned before we go to work
[21:42.800 --> 21:44.920]  We like to smoke down before we go in the grow room
[21:44.920 --> 21:48.200]  Then we put on good music and we're working with good friends or we're by ourselves
[21:48.600 --> 21:50.840]  Maybe you got Joe Rogan talking to you in your ear
[21:50.840 --> 21:54.240]  Maybe I'm yapping in your ear right now, and you're not paying a hundred percent attention
[21:55.120 --> 22:02.040]  Don't forget that there are a lot of moving parts and there's a lot of sharp and dangerous shit happening in the grow environment
[22:02.040 --> 22:06.240]  If you have got long hair or dreadlocks or something like that
[22:06.600 --> 22:11.360]  Keep that shit tucked away from the fans. Keep that shit tucked away from the blowers
[22:11.760 --> 22:15.600]  Also if you're working with any sort of trim machines or auto trimmers
[22:15.720 --> 22:20.200]  Tuck your hair and your dreadlocks up and also keep your fingers safe
[22:20.200 --> 22:23.520]  Maybe don't smoke that extra joint on your lunch break
[22:23.520 --> 22:27.700]  If you're gonna be the one running the trim machine take care of yourself and be careful
[22:28.040 --> 22:32.640]  Something I see cause a lot of problems in grow rooms is lanyards
[22:32.640 --> 22:37.120]  Those lanyards that are hanging out of our pockets with our keys on them. They get hung up on
[22:37.600 --> 22:41.760]  Everything if it's not a plant, it's a grow table. It's a hydro table
[22:41.760 --> 22:44.300]  It's a stake you get caught up on a valve switch
[22:44.300 --> 22:48.680]  You get caught up on a shelf put those lanyards in your pocket or in your locker
[22:48.680 --> 22:54.600]  Don't have that shit dangling out in the grow room. They are only problems. That's just like having another dreadlock hanging out
[22:54.760 --> 22:57.320]  Here's another random piece of grow room safety
[22:57.320 --> 23:03.960]  And this is actually a rule from the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division that I agree with we think a lot of rules are stupid
[23:03.960 --> 23:05.400]  This one makes a lot of sense
[23:05.400 --> 23:10.520]  If you're going to wear a lanyard around your neck in a grow environment a lot of growers right now
[23:10.520 --> 23:14.420]  They work in Colorado have a lanyard around their neck with their badge on it
[23:14.420 --> 23:16.220]  You've got to wear the badge to be in the building
[23:16.220 --> 23:20.120]  There are only a few ways to affix that to your body that is acceptable by the MED
[23:20.160 --> 23:23.340]  So it's got to be above the waist. Why not put it on a lanyard?
[23:23.340 --> 23:24.120]  That is a great spot
[23:24.120 --> 23:26.280]  If you're wearing a lanyard around your neck
[23:26.280 --> 23:30.800]  It must be what is known as a breakaway lanyard if I put enough pressure on that
[23:30.800 --> 23:35.520]  It should come undone and pop off your body so that it doesn't twist up around your neck and choke you
[23:35.520 --> 23:41.200]  The reason for that is there are fans in the grow room. Imagine if your lanyard got cut up in a fan
[23:41.200 --> 23:44.520]  You're the only one there the fan spins the lanyard twists
[23:44.520 --> 23:48.820]  It chokes the fuck out of you and you just got killed by a fucking fan in a grow room
[23:48.840 --> 23:54.640]  How stupid do you look right now? Don't be that guy. Don't be that girl. Don't be that person
[23:54.880 --> 23:59.740]  Also, if you're using a piece of trim equipment like the trim Reaper or a hurricane or something
[23:59.940 --> 24:06.480]  Imagine if your lanyard gets stuck in there and it's not breakaway. It's fucking sucking you in it's gonna put your face into that trimmer
[24:06.900 --> 24:10.760]  No good. We're going to the hospital incident report and you don't have a nose
[24:10.760 --> 24:18.020]  So please wear a breakaway lanyard and be careful be mindful and pay attention to what you were doing in the grow when you're turning around
[24:18.540 --> 24:23.300]  Where's your elbow going as you spin around think about when you squat down? Where does your ass go?
[24:23.300 --> 24:26.140]  Think about when you lean forward. What am I gonna put my eye into?
[24:26.740 --> 24:31.260]  Pay attention. I know it's a good time to be in the grow room. I know it's really relaxing
[24:31.260 --> 24:35.420]  I know we like to get blazed and put on good music. You probably have me or the dude grows in your ear
[24:35.420 --> 24:37.420]  You probably got Joe Rogan or somebody like that
[24:37.460 --> 24:41.980]  But let's have a little bit of grow room focus just to prevent and avoid injuries
[24:42.340 --> 24:46.360]  Another thing I've got written down is the word finger and foot smashes
[24:46.360 --> 24:50.020]  I like to work in a commercial environment with multiple people
[24:50.020 --> 24:55.100]  I've usually got four or five dudes working in multiple rooms and we all need to communicate in
[24:55.380 --> 25:02.860]  Many of the commercial facilities which I operate we've got tables that slide back and forth about 18 inches and that way we can push
[25:02.860 --> 25:03.820]  the tables together
[25:03.820 --> 25:07.980]  to one side of the room at the end of the day and then if we need to work on them we can spread them
[25:07.980 --> 25:11.820]  Apart and we can make rows and we can walk between them in most of these rooms
[25:11.820 --> 25:14.700]  I can only make one or two rows. So I'll be like hey, bro
[25:14.700 --> 25:17.500]  I'm gonna push these tables and we have to hear okay
[25:17.500 --> 25:21.100]  Okay from everybody else in the room before you move it because I don't need a guy
[25:21.220 --> 25:24.140]  Between two tables at the other end of the room getting squished
[25:24.140 --> 25:29.140]  I don't need a guy getting his fingers smashed stuff like that is very dangerous in a large-scale
[25:29.580 --> 25:37.020]  cultivation facility with multiple people you have to communicate if you're moving something heavy if you're carrying something heavy ask for help
[25:37.260 --> 25:39.780]  Clear a path that is my next note
[25:39.780 --> 25:41.780]  Here is clean things up
[25:41.940 --> 25:43.860]  If you've got a clean grow environment
[25:43.860 --> 25:50.580]  You've got less shit to stumble and trip and fall over and it's also just good practices to have a clean tidy
[25:50.700 --> 25:52.900]  Grow room then in that grow room
[25:52.900 --> 25:54.900]  I think you should also have a standard
[25:54.980 --> 26:00.140]  First aid kit and some sort of cleanup stuff if you spill something. Do you have some paper towels?
[26:00.140 --> 26:04.780]  Do you have a towel? Do you have basic first aid shit around? Can you clean out a boo-boo?
[26:04.780 --> 26:07.420]  Can you wrap a band-aid up on it? You have some gauze and tape
[26:07.420 --> 26:11.840]  Do you have all that basic shit available somewhere in your home somewhere near your grow space?
[26:12.180 --> 26:17.460]  The next thing I think about is if you do get hurt, who are you going to call? I'm in Colorado
[26:17.460 --> 26:20.360]  I'm gonna call 911 if I need it because it's legal here
[26:20.360 --> 26:25.460]  If you're not in Colorado, if you're in an illegal state, you may need to have a friend on speed dial
[26:25.620 --> 26:29.900]  It's always better to be able to call a friend instead of calling an ambulance or calling law enforcement
[26:30.060 --> 26:34.220]  If you've got some sort of minor injury that one of your friends can help you with
[26:34.220 --> 26:38.540]  Of course, if you've got something serious, you're gonna have to make the decision. You may have to call for help
[26:38.540 --> 26:41.300]  I hope it never comes to that. Hopefully you've got a friend
[26:41.380 --> 26:44.860]  Maybe you got a girlfriend or a wife or maybe your mama lives by you or something like that
[26:44.860 --> 26:49.500]  But hopefully you don't ever have to call for help. That's just a worst-case scenario
[26:50.180 --> 26:55.160]  I've only got a couple of more bullet points to cover the next two things that I've got written down are the words
[26:55.420 --> 26:57.360]  PL or other monitors
[26:57.360 --> 27:04.060]  I would recommend you have something like a PL minder unit or another sort of a monitoring device in your grow that will let you
[27:04.060 --> 27:07.340]  Know if temperatures get too high if humidity gets too high
[27:07.620 --> 27:12.700]  Something in the grow that will indicate you via an email via text message and give you a live
[27:13.140 --> 27:17.900]  Real-time update of what is happening in that grow if my grow room gets too hot right now
[27:17.900 --> 27:22.640]  My PL grow minder unit will send an email to my phone. My phone will alert me
[27:22.640 --> 27:27.260]  I'll open up that email and it will say hey right now your grow room is way too hot and I'll be able to go
[27:27.260 --> 27:30.740]  To the grow room and I'll say oh it's too hot because of this and I can make corrections
[27:31.260 --> 27:36.220]  Another thing I really find helpful to keep my grow safe is a camera system
[27:36.220 --> 27:38.580]  I like to have a security system on the house
[27:38.660 --> 27:44.740]  Anyway, that just seems to be standard in this day and age, but also why not put a camera in your grow?
[27:45.300 --> 27:48.060]  That camera won't be able to see heat or humidity
[27:48.060 --> 27:53.980]  But you've got a PL minder unit telling you that stuff the camera will let you visually see if those plants are too dry
[27:53.980 --> 28:00.220]  The camera will let you see if something is tipped over the camera will really help you out in more ways than you can even
[28:00.220 --> 28:03.680]  Think of until the time comes you'll go. Oh, I'm so glad that camera was there
[28:03.800 --> 28:09.080]  So I really like having some sort of a real-time monitoring device that I can access remotely
[28:09.080 --> 28:14.160]  I also enjoy having a camera which again I can access remotely and see a real-time video
[28:14.640 --> 28:19.600]  then the next things to think about when it comes to safety are cops and
[28:20.240 --> 28:23.640]  Robbers if you live in a legal state, you don't have to worry too much about cops
[28:23.840 --> 28:25.840]  But if you live in an illegal state
[28:25.920 --> 28:32.200]  You need to be prepared on how you are going to act and how you are going to respond if they do show up at
[28:32.200 --> 28:34.800]  Your front door knock knock knock who is it?
[28:34.800 --> 28:40.040]  It's the police your heart drops you shit your pants a little bit you pee a couple of drops you take that big swallow
[28:40.040 --> 28:41.600]  you go and
[28:41.600 --> 28:44.540]  Then you go you open the door and you go can I help you and they go?
[28:44.540 --> 28:47.420]  Yeah, we're either here because like something down the street happened
[28:47.420 --> 28:51.700]  We want to ask you questions the answer that is I ain't seen shit and you close the door or they're gonna go
[28:51.700 --> 28:53.200]  Hey, we heard you have a grow here
[28:53.200 --> 28:57.760]  You're gonna have to figure out what you're gonna say think about that now you need to have an answer
[28:58.320 --> 29:03.180]  Again when the time comes you're gonna shit your pants a couple of drops of pee are gonna come out your palms are gonna get
[29:03.180 --> 29:06.060]  Sweaty the cops are at your front door. It's time to go
[29:06.120 --> 29:11.240]  It's always better to have a prepared answer than try to think of shit right then so know what you're going to say
[29:11.560 --> 29:17.060]  Most of that conversation should end with come back when you've got a warrant, but I don't know the particular situation
[29:17.060 --> 29:22.920]  But you should be prepared. The next thing to think about is robbers. Hopefully you've got those cameras out front
[29:22.920 --> 29:25.260]  They see those cameras. They don't want to fuck with you
[29:25.260 --> 29:32.740]  Some people have bigger plans and they don't care about your cameras and they are going to come get your cannabis crop and possibly whatever
[29:32.740 --> 29:38.380]  Else you have got in that house. Are you prepared for that? How are you going to respond or react to that?
[29:38.420 --> 29:42.020]  That is up to you. I'm not going to give you ideas on what to do now
[29:42.020 --> 29:47.300]  But you should think about that in your situation. I don't know where you live. I don't know your environment
[29:47.300 --> 29:51.300]  I don't know the kind of people around you and I don't know the kind of risks that you are running
[29:51.300 --> 29:53.300]  But these are things that you need to think about
[29:53.300 --> 30:00.740]  Cops and robbers are always a thing when it comes to cannabis production whether it is a legal or illegal environment
[30:00.740 --> 30:05.540]  I think the most important thing to think about when it comes to safety in a grow room whether it be a
[30:05.900 --> 30:11.520]  Personal production area or a large-scale commercial cultivation environment is pay attention
[30:11.520 --> 30:16.100]  I keep saying that I know we like to smoke when we grow but be aware
[30:16.220 --> 30:21.260]  Maybe don't smoke that third dab before you go to work. Maybe don't smoke that fifth joint
[30:21.260 --> 30:24.380]  Maybe put that blunt out three quarters of the way before you get to work
[30:24.380 --> 30:26.500]  So you don't cut yourself so you don't cause a problem
[30:26.860 --> 30:33.340]  Also, so you don't mix up those nutrients wrong if you can handle your smoke you do your thing if you can't you dial it
[30:33.340 --> 30:38.940]  Back, but the main thing is that we be mindful and we pay very close attention to what we are doing in our grows
[30:38.940 --> 30:45.940]  So that we don't hurt ourselves or others and so that we don't cause problems to the grow by making stupid mistakes
[30:46.420 --> 30:52.500]  Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls pimps and hoes smokers and growers. I really had a lot of fun recording this episode
