[00:17.280 --> 00:19.680]  Yeah. Welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.680 --> 00:23.280]  It's time for episode number one 53 of the grow from your heart podcast,
[00:23.600 --> 00:27.360]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:27.360 --> 00:29.240]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.240 --> 00:31.160]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.520 --> 00:34.440]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:34.440 --> 00:38.440]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.040 --> 00:40.800]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.800 --> 00:43.280]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:43.320 --> 00:46.200]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the mystic roots
[00:46.240 --> 00:49.720]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big thanks to Kat,
[00:50.280 --> 00:54.600]  the entire mystic roots crew, ladies and gentlemen, this episode,
[00:54.600 --> 00:58.080]  I'm joined by white Mike. And we talk a lot about CBD.
[00:58.800 --> 01:01.160]  The episode was kind of long, so I'm not going to waste a lot of time.
[01:01.160 --> 01:03.640]  I'm going to let the music play. And when we get back,
[01:03.880 --> 01:06.480]  Mike and I will be at the dab table. Hang out with us.
[01:09.520 --> 01:12.800]  I just now did. So you seriously are going to cough. That was all I got from you.
[01:12.840 --> 01:13.880]  Oh, there it is. All right.
[01:13.880 --> 01:17.200]  There's always a little, I knew you were going to cough a little bit for me.
[01:17.880 --> 01:19.040]  We'll just get some things set up here.
[01:19.040 --> 01:21.520]  You get the settings all accurate so that sounds real good.
[01:21.840 --> 01:23.560]  I might've been good at you not mentioned something.
[01:24.560 --> 01:27.320]  I'm coughing too. Don't worry. The we're good. The,
[01:28.080 --> 01:30.400]  I just got a pretty funny text message. Uh, now they,
[01:30.480 --> 01:33.080]  they may hear the air conditioner in the back just because of what I got set up.
[01:33.160 --> 01:34.560]  That's all right. Oh, there's some headphones.
[01:36.080 --> 01:39.240]  Yeah. Go ahead. Everybody. How you doing Mike? I'm doing good.
[01:40.640 --> 01:42.720]  Can you bring the headphones down just a touch, man?
[01:44.240 --> 01:48.120]  Hmm. There we go. Bam. No, that's a little low. There you go.
[01:49.360 --> 01:52.160]  That thing is touching. Oh, doing good, man.
[01:53.400 --> 01:55.360]  Good. Good. Needed a couple of days.
[01:57.320 --> 01:58.840]  And I think we got there.
[01:59.640 --> 02:01.120]  Me too. I'm trying not to cough in the microphone,
[02:01.160 --> 02:02.000]  getting everything set up here.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  I think we're ready to do a podcast ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04.000 --> 02:04.840]  We're just going to go from here.
[02:05.320 --> 02:08.160]  Seat backs and tray table slopes in the upright position.
[02:08.160 --> 02:10.720]  Nobody's in any upright position here. No, no, no.
[02:10.720 --> 02:14.280]  Kick it back and drop that tray. It's time for a podcast. Get comfy.
[02:14.280 --> 02:18.240]  That's funny shit. Get your work tools out. If you're listening, working,
[02:18.360 --> 02:19.240]  did you groove on?
[02:19.960 --> 02:23.200]  What I wanted to talk about first is everyone's talking about this honey bee,
[02:23.600 --> 02:26.400]  uh, thing on Facebook. I've seen that a couple of spots.
[02:26.440 --> 02:29.160]  People are claiming that this dude in France is,
[02:29.320 --> 02:34.320]  has trained his honey bees to make THC laden honey by collecting THC from
[02:37.040 --> 02:40.120]  cannabis plants. Now I'm not a bee expert,
[02:41.040 --> 02:42.800]  but I don't think that's how this works.
[02:43.720 --> 02:47.640]  Uh, I I'm here to say that I don't think that this is real.
[02:47.680 --> 02:49.120]  I think it's bullshit to tell you the truth.
[02:49.680 --> 02:52.920]  I, uh, when I first saw it online, I was like, no, that's really cool.
[02:52.920 --> 02:56.360]  I want to get weight. Bees collect pollen. Yes.
[02:56.680 --> 03:01.240]  Tricombs collect pollen. Yeah. They are not themselves.
[03:02.360 --> 03:05.480]  The pistols collect the pollen to be more to be more accurate,
[03:05.500 --> 03:09.960]  but the pollen is actually used as a defense against insects. Uh,
[03:10.080 --> 03:13.400]  and they do show pictures of bees on the cannabis,
[03:13.400 --> 03:17.360]  on the female cannabis plants and what, uh,
[03:17.400 --> 03:20.280]  somebody says in one of these debunking websites,
[03:20.400 --> 03:21.920]  cause I did do research before I came on,
[03:22.800 --> 03:24.360]  on a podcast and said that it was bullshit.
[03:24.360 --> 03:26.320]  I did do some research to back myself up.
[03:26.320 --> 03:30.200]  They claimed that they just simply sprayed sugar water on the budding female
[03:30.220 --> 03:33.520]  plants to encourage those bees to land there. Now, yes,
[03:33.800 --> 03:37.480]  maybe a little bit of THC will stick to those marketing ploy for homies, honey.
[03:37.840 --> 03:41.880]  I think so. Yeah. So in his video, they do show male plants. Yeah.
[03:42.040 --> 03:45.520]  So what I think may be happening, and I'm going to back up a little bit.
[03:45.520 --> 03:49.840]  This guy says he's getting THC honey from cannabis plants.
[03:50.080 --> 03:52.760]  He can be doing that. He may be, that's totally a thing.
[03:52.760 --> 03:54.920]  It's just not going to be psychoactive, right?
[03:54.920 --> 03:57.520]  He may be getting pollen from male cannabis plants.
[03:57.560 --> 04:01.000]  Those bees are gathering that pollen. They're flying back to their hive.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.520]  They're putting that pollen in the little thing that they put it in that little
[04:03.520 --> 04:05.640]  honeycomb. And then they, uh, they actually,
[04:06.040 --> 04:10.120]  bees actually chew up the pollen in their mouths and they regurgitate it.
[04:10.440 --> 04:14.960]  And something in their regurgitation creates the nectar to turn into
[04:14.960 --> 04:18.160]  honey. So this is why I don't like knowing how everything's made. Yes.
[04:18.480 --> 04:20.360]  Nature is fucking gross. I really liked honey.
[04:20.360 --> 04:23.480]  Now I'm going to have to try to not think about the fact that it's bee vomit.
[04:23.520 --> 04:27.320]  Yeah. It's straight up bee puke. So bees, your pukes pretty tasty. Yeah.
[04:28.080 --> 04:31.160]  And it's got some really cool medicinal effects. Way better than mine, bro.
[04:31.360 --> 04:35.200]  So there so gross. Uh, side note, side note,
[04:35.200 --> 04:38.320]  totally random side note. Jelly belly has created some new flavors.
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.360]  And one of their new flavors is vomit. Oh, yeah. Right.
[04:42.360 --> 04:46.160]  Who wants it? Vomit flavored jelly belly. That's not funny. So these,
[04:46.400 --> 04:49.560]  these flies, these bees are going and they're collecting,
[04:49.560 --> 04:52.600]  they could be collecting the male pollen from these male plants and flying back
[04:52.600 --> 04:57.440]  and creating honey out of that. That is very feasible. I do not see how, uh,
[04:57.460 --> 05:00.760]  they could land on a female cannabis plant with trichomes on it and gather
[05:00.760 --> 05:04.960]  trichomes and fly enough trichomes back to the hive to make cannabis honey.
[05:04.960 --> 05:07.120]  That doesn't seem feasible to me. Uh,
[05:07.160 --> 05:10.160]  well I don't see them purposefully gathering the trichomes either.
[05:10.160 --> 05:13.600]  So any sort of trichome gathering is going to be incidental or accidental.
[05:13.640 --> 05:16.120]  Yeah, completely. And I think that it's probably,
[05:16.120 --> 05:20.160]  have you ever been trimming and rub your eye? Super? Yeah. Don't do that.
[05:20.200 --> 05:23.680]  It burns. We've spent like the first half hour at any new trim gig warning the
[05:23.680 --> 05:26.360]  dude, the new people not to do that. Right. And somebody will do it.
[05:26.520 --> 05:29.120]  Somebody will just rub their eye. Every time it happens. It's a,
[05:29.440 --> 05:31.640]  the plant gives off pheromones.
[05:31.640 --> 05:35.160]  Sometimes people have allergy style reactions to it.
[05:35.160 --> 05:38.240]  And sometimes your face gets itchy when you're trimming. That's just the thing.
[05:38.280 --> 05:41.640]  And so you rub your eye and it burns. Yeah. You only make that mistake once.
[05:41.640 --> 05:43.560]  It's like getting maced and it sucks.
[05:43.560 --> 05:46.200]  You can't make it quit because your fingers are sticky because you're trimming.
[05:46.280 --> 05:47.520]  So you got to deal with it.
[05:47.760 --> 05:52.720]  I think that the pH was far too hot for these bees to be able to handle it.
[05:52.720 --> 05:55.560]  I think it would burn the bees. I think they would just be like, nah, fuck this.
[05:55.560 --> 05:56.760]  I don't want anything to do with it.
[05:56.960 --> 06:00.200]  See, I don't know if it would be too acidic or to like burn them.
[06:00.200 --> 06:03.360]  But I think that the stickiness of the tackiness would annoy the shit.
[06:03.360 --> 06:06.560]  I don't know. That's definitely part of what the trichome is designed to do.
[06:06.560 --> 06:09.640]  It's to partially to keep those bugs away from there. So,
[06:09.960 --> 06:11.880]  so I could see this totally be like,
[06:12.160 --> 06:17.160]  there may be serious benefits to bees collecting male cannabis pollen and
[06:17.680 --> 06:20.640]  turning that into honey, but it's definitely not like weed.
[06:20.640 --> 06:25.000]  Honey is as advertised, right? It's a very cool marketing ploy.
[06:25.000 --> 06:28.480]  It is a very cool video, but I think it is inaccurate.
[06:28.480 --> 06:31.920]  I think it's misleading and I don't think you're getting THC honey. I,
[06:32.200 --> 06:35.480]  I want to see this happen. You know what I mean? I want it to be, uh,
[06:35.520 --> 06:37.720]  somebody said earlier, they ain't going to do it on the honor system.
[06:37.760 --> 06:40.800]  I want to watch them, uh, make this honey.
[06:40.840 --> 06:42.840]  And then I want to watch the bees do their thing.
[06:44.360 --> 06:47.840]  And then I want to take that honey to a lab and let steep hill test that honey
[06:47.840 --> 06:49.840]  for me and see what type of cannabinoids are in there.
[06:49.880 --> 06:50.000]  Well,
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.600]  that's what I was thinking when we were kind of talking about this before the
[06:52.600 --> 06:54.520]  show is for that to happen,
[06:54.520 --> 06:58.760]  we would have to bring this little homie to Colorado with his bees and his
[06:58.760 --> 06:59.640]  cannabis plants,
[07:00.800 --> 07:03.800]  because that's the only place on the planet where we could really collect and
[07:03.800 --> 07:07.200]  lab test that in a controlled way without him going to jail immediately after.
[07:07.480 --> 07:08.680]  I think he can do it in Spain.
[07:09.480 --> 07:12.960]  May and he's in France. So he's just a border jump boy. I think.
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.520]  Spain's grow home grow. I haven't looked at him for a minute.
[07:16.520 --> 07:19.800]  I don't think they have Spanabus and there's a hillside in Spain.
[07:19.800 --> 07:20.800]  I forget the name of the place.
[07:21.040 --> 07:23.120]  I feel bad that I can't remember the name of the region,
[07:23.120 --> 07:25.880]  but there's a small region in Spain where they do not care about cannabis
[07:25.880 --> 07:27.360]  growing. A lot of people go there.
[07:27.520 --> 07:29.920]  They, uh, they might have the ability to grow,
[07:29.920 --> 07:33.720]  but do they have the access to the same testing kind of labs that we do?
[07:33.760 --> 07:34.920]  That's a very good question.
[07:35.120 --> 07:38.560]  Because both in the same area are one of the things that make Colorado's
[07:38.560 --> 07:40.040]  cannabis market. So awesome.
[07:40.200 --> 07:43.880]  Dude come to Colorado, bring your bees, bring your, bring your gear.
[07:44.400 --> 07:47.320]  We'll do what we gotta do. We want to see this happen. We want to test your bees.
[07:47.320 --> 07:50.360]  You've heard about a dude in a, on a mildly related note,
[07:50.360 --> 07:52.200]  the dude in Oregon that's doing the hogs.
[07:52.480 --> 07:57.480]  No, he, uh, um, you know how here the waste from the cannabis grow,
[07:57.480 --> 08:00.520]  you have to do specific stuff with it. So it doesn't end up right.
[08:00.880 --> 08:04.000]  Teenagers hands or whatever out of your dumpster ground up into little tiny
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.960]  pieces, run through a wood chipper and then mixed with other product, right?
[08:07.960 --> 08:11.240]  A shop up in Oregon, um, hog,
[08:11.280 --> 08:14.680]  found a hog farmer to take care of a farm. Perfect. Um,
[08:14.680 --> 08:17.480]  and so they take all that plant material and, uh, I,
[08:17.560 --> 08:18.800]  I'm not exactly sure what he,
[08:18.880 --> 08:22.080]  what the farmer does to it between picking it up from the shop and dropping it
[08:22.120 --> 08:25.360]  off with the pigs, but I'm assuming it's not much. Um,
[08:25.440 --> 08:28.840]  and they chow down on that as a primary food source for most of their life.
[08:28.920 --> 08:29.400]  That's a,
[08:29.400 --> 08:32.920]  the Rocky mountain worm company in Colorado Springs has a deal worked out with
[08:32.920 --> 08:36.120]  the very well-known vape pen company, uh, open.
[08:36.440 --> 08:38.200]  They grow their products in their warehouse.
[08:38.320 --> 08:41.920]  They chopped down their plants and the waste from their plants is then, uh,
[08:41.960 --> 08:46.160]  it's mixed properly so that it's a MED compliant and the MED has approved this
[08:46.160 --> 08:46.840]  transaction.
[08:46.840 --> 08:50.480]  They send all of the waste to the Rocky mountain worm company and the Rocky
[08:50.840 --> 08:55.160]  mountain worm company feeds that back to their worms and the worms compost that.
[08:55.440 --> 08:59.480]  And then the Rocky mountain worm company in turn sells their worm castings at a
[08:59.480 --> 09:03.960]  discount back to open vapes grow. It's brilliant. It goes full circle. Yeah.
[09:03.960 --> 09:06.640]  So it's getting reused and refed back to the worms.
[09:06.640 --> 09:09.040]  It's kind of keeping it a little more eco-friendly.
[09:09.040 --> 09:12.200]  We need to learn as growers as professional responsible growers.
[09:12.200 --> 09:15.080]  It is time to figure out how to reduce our carbon footprint.
[09:15.080 --> 09:16.680]  I don't know how to do that very well.
[09:16.800 --> 09:18.400]  Well, a lot of the places, the,
[09:18.400 --> 09:22.760]  the laws around cannabis make that specific topic incredibly brutal.
[09:23.000 --> 09:23.760]  Right. And Boulder,
[09:23.760 --> 09:27.320]  I think they have to run solar to offset all of their electricity or something
[09:27.320 --> 09:27.680]  similar.
[09:27.680 --> 09:32.640]  Past a law in Boulder saying a hundred per year marijuana businesses had to be
[09:32.640 --> 09:34.280]  a hundred percent energy neutral,
[09:34.680 --> 09:38.000]  which means they can't consume any power they don't generate. Um,
[09:38.040 --> 09:40.600]  and immediately after passing that law,
[09:40.600 --> 09:43.880]  they realized how unenforceable or not unenforceable,
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.080]  but unfeasible it was to require that immediately. Um,
[09:47.080 --> 09:51.920]  and so they've been given some time to, to upgrade, but, uh, um,
[09:52.560 --> 09:56.400]  it's one of the things that made Pueblo so popular is that we allow greenhouse.
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  Um, Denver is not a greenhouse. Boulder does not allow greenhouse.
[10:00.040 --> 10:03.560]  And we have the prime greenhouse area here. It's perfect. Greenhouse country.
[10:04.120 --> 10:06.120]  It's beautiful country here to grow cannabis or hemp.
[10:06.280 --> 10:09.320]  Yep. We designated, um, a whole bunch of water,
[10:09.360 --> 10:11.680]  just kind of set it aside for, you know,
[10:11.720 --> 10:14.640]  that's all will least to marijuana grows at the beginning of this.
[10:14.640 --> 10:17.200]  We've barely touched that number. Cool. Um,
[10:17.200 --> 10:19.480]  so there's a ton of that still kind of in reserve,
[10:19.480 --> 10:21.480]  even with the industry as big as it is down here.
[10:21.520 --> 10:24.040]  That's one of the hardest things to do is to get the water rights.
[10:24.040 --> 10:26.680]  Once you get something set up, you have to get a water lawyer.
[10:26.720 --> 10:30.040]  It was something nobody thought of until about a year and a half,
[10:30.040 --> 10:34.560]  two years ago when we finally finished the rules and regs process.
[10:35.080 --> 10:39.640]  Um, you can't just hammer out a well and go to town down here in Southern
[10:39.640 --> 10:42.680]  Colorado. We've got a lot of rules when it comes to water here. Yeah.
[10:42.680 --> 10:43.280]  Well they know,
[10:43.280 --> 10:46.640]  they know that big commercial grows are coming and trying to use up the water
[10:46.640 --> 10:49.680]  and they want to keep it for you and I to drink, which is cool. You know,
[10:49.680 --> 10:52.640]  they've got a good water plan down here. So all that's taken care of the,
[10:52.680 --> 10:57.680]  it's one of the more recent anti pot talking points is how much water the plant
[10:57.680 --> 11:02.000]  drinks or how much energy growing an indoor costs. It's like, well, you know,
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.560]  if you didn't prohibit it in 46 of the 50 States,
[11:06.040 --> 11:08.680]  more of it would be grown under the sun. Um,
[11:08.680 --> 11:12.280]  we'd be using significantly less power to produce all this if we could just
[11:12.280 --> 11:14.960]  grow it outdoors like a normal crop. But Oh no.
[11:15.080 --> 11:19.600]  When do we vote on the city elections for 200 and 300? Uh, in the presidential.
[11:19.840 --> 11:23.480]  Okay. Uh, November, November, November 8th we will put out a podcast.
[11:23.480 --> 11:27.320]  I'm making a note. Yeah, we'll do an election podcast at some point. People,
[11:27.360 --> 11:28.800]  this is not that episode,
[11:29.200 --> 11:33.320]  but we need to guide people on what to vote on locally, but very specifically,
[11:33.520 --> 11:36.080]  we'll do that in a whole nother show. We'll do a little segment on it just for
[11:36.360 --> 11:40.280]  them. What's the date today is today the ninth today, maybe the ninth. Okay.
[11:40.280 --> 11:44.440]  So yesterday was the last day for people to submit ballot issue paperwork.
[11:44.440 --> 11:48.760]  So the final election ballots, they're all hammering out that paperwork now.
[11:48.760 --> 11:52.080]  So we'll have all the final information for November here in a week or two.
[11:52.440 --> 11:53.640]  So that's perfect. Perfect.
[11:53.680 --> 11:57.680]  We'll do an episode to teach you guys locally what to vote for because the
[11:57.680 --> 11:59.920]  wording is confusing. I do agree with that.
[11:59.960 --> 12:02.320]  There's going to be, it's more way more than one question.
[12:02.320 --> 12:05.840]  It's not just going to be a yes or no vote. Yes for weed vote. No against weed.
[12:05.840 --> 12:10.000]  It's going to be much more complicated than that. Yeah. All right. So, uh,
[12:10.040 --> 12:13.360]  this episode, I want to put this back on a, some, some educational topics.
[12:14.320 --> 12:15.560]  Yes. Back on some rails.
[12:15.840 --> 12:20.200]  Mike's had a headache and he took a couple of dabs of CBD when I got here and
[12:20.400 --> 12:23.120]  he's a really, his color came back. He's more relaxed.
[12:23.120 --> 12:25.040]  I can see that the headache has kind of gone away a little bit.
[12:25.040 --> 12:27.240]  You feeling better, bro? I'm feeling a lot better.
[12:27.280 --> 12:30.240]  Where's the proper container? Cause I got three of them that look alike.
[12:30.600 --> 12:35.520]  The product I'm consuming right now is 3% THC.
[12:36.000 --> 12:37.840]  1.3% CBD,
[12:38.280 --> 12:43.080]  38.99% CBD a and six or
[12:43.080 --> 12:48.240]  36.32% THC a and an additional 6%
[12:48.240 --> 12:50.040]  CBG. Um,
[12:50.080 --> 12:54.960]  so this has got a bizarrely wide range of cannabinoids in it and
[12:54.960 --> 12:59.520]  a really good on headaches and some other things, pain and inflammation as well.
[12:59.560 --> 13:01.880]  What kind of hash would you call that? What kind of, um,
[13:01.920 --> 13:03.600]  it depends what temperature it is.
[13:04.480 --> 13:09.240]  It's, it's intended as a shatter, um, at about 65 degrees.
[13:09.600 --> 13:13.240]  It's a pretty nice shatter. It shatters real nice. It's 70.
[13:13.640 --> 13:16.320]  It's a really sticky taffy.
[13:16.320 --> 13:19.760]  So you take two pieces and you pull it apart to just kind of stretches into it.
[13:19.760 --> 13:21.440]  I watched you try to get a dab out of there.
[13:21.480 --> 13:25.720]  It can be a little tricky to get a dab out of there. It, uh, it above like 65.
[13:25.720 --> 13:29.360]  So what he's talking about is a smokeable concentrate. It's some hash,
[13:29.400 --> 13:33.320]  some shatter, uh, with a pretty good CBD to THC ratio.
[13:33.440 --> 13:34.960]  Yeah, it's about 50, 50.
[13:35.160 --> 13:37.360]  You could tell Mike was hurting about 20 minutes ago.
[13:37.360 --> 13:40.560]  He had a pretty good headache and he took two dabs of that and put on his
[13:40.560 --> 13:42.600]  headphones like, all right, dude, let's record a podcast.
[13:42.600 --> 13:46.440]  So the CBD definitely reduced the pain in your headache and it improved your
[13:46.440 --> 13:47.480]  attitude because of that.
[13:47.560 --> 13:50.280]  Oh yeah. I feel a hundred percent better. Um,
[13:50.320 --> 13:54.760]  now that I've put something that's half and half THC CBD into my system for the
[13:54.760 --> 13:59.640]  day, um, my knees feel better. My neck, the tension in my neck feels better. Um,
[13:59.640 --> 14:02.800]  I had a wicked headache when I got here, folks. I was, uh, uh,
[14:02.800 --> 14:05.640]  we're sitting at the table kind of catching up and dabbing and I'm basically
[14:05.640 --> 14:09.240]  just staring at the table, rubbing my eyes and my temples cause it hurts so bad.
[14:09.720 --> 14:11.760]  I'm thinking I might not podcast tonight.
[14:11.760 --> 14:14.720]  I might just have to bail after a dab or two and go home cause I'm hurting.
[14:15.360 --> 14:19.800]  And the addition of some CBD into my world has reset that completely.
[14:20.480 --> 14:25.480]  Um, I've been a big fan of CBD for a long time. Um,
[14:25.560 --> 14:27.760]  it's good for what else? Yeah, I'll put it that way.
[14:27.800 --> 14:31.600]  That's the truth. Uh, one thing that I, and I, I've said it on the show,
[14:31.600 --> 14:35.960]  I'm not a huge smoker of CBD. I don't use a lot of CBD products when I smoke.
[14:35.960 --> 14:40.760]  I prefer a nice THC head buzz. I want to get high. I want to make my head spin.
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.640]  I want to get confused. I want to get goofy. I want to get talkative.
[14:43.840 --> 14:46.520]  That's what a good sativa does to me. When I smoke too much CBD,
[14:46.880 --> 14:50.840]  I honestly just get lazy and it kind of ruins my high. Uh,
[14:50.880 --> 14:53.320]  yeah, I'm not stoned right now. And that's,
[14:53.480 --> 14:57.680]  I took four knobs all THC dabs here a minute ago. Um,
[14:57.680 --> 15:00.160]  and I had a nice little buzz going on, but right before the show,
[15:00.160 --> 15:03.280]  I didn't want my headache to come back. So I took two more, um,
[15:03.280 --> 15:07.960]  half and half THC CBD dabs and it, uh, it brought me my high back down to like,
[15:07.960 --> 15:09.080]  a two nice.
[15:09.240 --> 15:11.800]  I'm sitting thinking about some Clementine here.
[15:11.920 --> 15:15.400]  If you have got some pineapple Jack, I've got some pineapple Jack.
[15:15.400 --> 15:16.880]  If you want to dab at that, feel free to reach in.
[15:16.880 --> 15:18.440]  I'm going to pull this piece off right here for myself,
[15:18.440 --> 15:22.840]  but here's some shatter piece. That's like six of my dabs. It looks like a flag.
[15:23.800 --> 15:25.880]  It does look like kind of like a flag is a card cap.
[15:25.880 --> 15:29.920]  If you had a model train that dad would be American flag size.
[15:29.920 --> 15:34.240]  There you go. Perfect. Yes, it would. It's probably about 0.3 ish. I don't know.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.800]  Uh, so I, I don't use a lot of CBD products, but one time, uh,
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.600]  listeners of this podcast will know, uh,
[15:42.920 --> 15:45.440]  over a year ago in April of 2015,
[15:46.520 --> 15:50.400]  but no, when I hit my head, I had injury. I hit my head in April.
[15:50.840 --> 15:53.600]  And I was having issues. Uh,
[15:53.640 --> 15:58.600]  my head hurt for three weeks. Like honestly, my head was throbbing.
[15:58.600 --> 16:01.720]  I w I was fucked up. I had a traumatic, I have a traumatic brain injury.
[16:01.720 --> 16:04.480]  I still have post-concussion syndrome. I have a lot of,
[16:04.800 --> 16:08.920]  it's been over 18 months and I still have effects from that concussion.
[16:08.920 --> 16:10.440]  I knocked myself clean the fuck out.
[16:10.440 --> 16:14.040]  I was out for a good 30 to 45 seconds, like unconscious on the ground.
[16:14.400 --> 16:18.400]  People had to pick me up, get me going again. Uh, it fucked me up.
[16:19.040 --> 16:23.560]  My head hurt for several days. I could not get right. When I took a dab of,
[16:23.680 --> 16:27.120]  you weren't yourself for six weeks after. Yeah, no,
[16:27.120 --> 16:32.080]  I was myself for six months after it felt like there was a substantial
[16:32.640 --> 16:36.280]  improvement after about six weeks. But I mean,
[16:36.280 --> 16:40.400]  it took half a year before you were feeling like yourself all the way. Yeah.
[16:41.160 --> 16:45.760]  Yeah. But so Spencer would invite me over just to check on me. He'd be like, bro,
[16:45.760 --> 16:47.280]  come hang out, come kick it. You've been like,
[16:47.280 --> 16:48.440]  he could tell I was getting depressed.
[16:48.440 --> 16:50.120]  Cause when you hit your head and have a traumatic brain injury,
[16:50.120 --> 16:52.600]  you get depressed and shit. Cause you're not the same that you used to be.
[16:52.600 --> 16:55.320]  My skills weren't where they were. And I was bummed out.
[16:55.840 --> 16:57.720]  So my friends were really hanging out and trying to help me out.
[16:57.720 --> 16:59.480]  Shout out to all my friends that helped me through that head injury.
[16:59.840 --> 17:02.560]  But Spence would invite me over. And one night he's like, bro,
[17:02.560 --> 17:05.520]  I made some CBD hash oil for the cannabis cup.
[17:05.520 --> 17:08.960]  And this shit actually won the best CBD concentrate at the high times.
[17:08.960 --> 17:13.080]  Cannabis got wonderful. But he gave me a big fat dab of it. He goes, dog,
[17:13.080 --> 17:16.840]  hit this. Cause when I would smoke normal shatter, like THC or sativas,
[17:17.040 --> 17:19.080]  my head would throb even more. It would just feel like,
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.240]  and I could feel it. And it felt like I had,
[17:23.280 --> 17:26.760]  it felt like I had a belt around my head or like my hat was way too tight is
[17:26.760 --> 17:30.120]  what it felt like all day, every day for a couple, for like weeks.
[17:30.520 --> 17:34.880]  And Spence gives me these CBD dabs and I breathed in with the dab and I blew out
[17:34.880 --> 17:38.240]  that dab. And it felt like you just undid that belt about one notch.
[17:38.440 --> 17:41.440]  It didn't like fix it, but it totally undid that belt a notch.
[17:41.960 --> 17:44.520]  And Maddie and Spence looked at me and they go, wow, did that help?
[17:44.600 --> 17:47.160]  And I was like, yeah, how could you tell? And like, you sat up,
[17:47.200 --> 17:49.680]  your neck went straight again. And I was like, what do you mean?
[17:49.680 --> 17:52.120]  I'm like, you've been like slouching weird. And you've been like crooked.
[17:52.560 --> 17:54.360]  And I was like, well, let me get another dad like that.
[17:54.400 --> 17:57.560]  And after like three or four of those CBD dabs, I was like,
[17:57.560 --> 18:00.320]  I haven't felt this good since before I hit my head.
[18:00.340 --> 18:02.680]  Like it really did something to me. It fixed.
[18:02.960 --> 18:05.280]  And so they gave me some of that stuff and they're like, dad,
[18:05.280 --> 18:09.920]  this like dab it every day. And it's got me. It really did help.
[18:10.120 --> 18:14.480]  I found a good half THC, half CBD mix about,
[18:15.400 --> 18:19.880]  Oh, maybe two years ago. Um, and it was really hard to come by back then.
[18:20.720 --> 18:25.320]  Um, but I've got a lot of inflammation in like my knees and my neck, um,
[18:25.360 --> 18:29.920]  where it's just for one stupid medical reason or another,
[18:29.920 --> 18:33.360]  the bones grind on each other and the tissue gets swollen.
[18:33.400 --> 18:37.200]  We're both over. You're like six, four, right? Yep. I'm six, five. Yep.
[18:37.200 --> 18:40.080]  You probably weigh a good two 30. I'm guessing I'm not good at that.
[18:40.760 --> 18:44.200]  Okay. All right. I'm not good at that. So Mike,
[18:44.880 --> 18:48.360]  probably two 50 ish over there. I'm guessing by that reaction, uh,
[18:48.440 --> 18:52.840]  I'm right about 200 pounds. Most of the time, these knees, bro, God,
[18:52.840 --> 18:57.040]  our knees get, there's so much leverage going on in the guys, our sizes, legs.
[18:57.040 --> 19:00.560]  How many times have you stood up into like a heating duct? Oh yeah.
[19:00.600 --> 19:02.720]  And just cramped your neck.
[19:02.760 --> 19:06.520]  But when I busted my head, I really jerked my neck back like completely.
[19:06.520 --> 19:10.000]  So that still, and I've been in car accidents. I grew up in Colorado.
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.360]  There's a lot of fun stuff here that you can tumble down.
[19:13.040 --> 19:15.360]  Um, cartwheels with skis,
[19:15.480 --> 19:19.920]  unreleasing on my feet was one of the really fun ones that led to no cartilage
[19:19.920 --> 19:21.760]  in either knee. Um,
[19:21.880 --> 19:25.360]  I rode bicycles as a kid in California, but, uh, the,
[19:25.640 --> 19:26.640]  the end results,
[19:26.640 --> 19:30.320]  all this trauma over the years of having fun in Colorado is that, uh,
[19:30.640 --> 19:34.040]  there's a lot of inflammation and a lot of swelling in a places that press on
[19:34.040 --> 19:35.480]  nerves. Um,
[19:35.480 --> 19:40.280]  and then that causes phantom nerve pain or basically the same stuff amputees get
[19:40.280 --> 19:44.760]  when like they lose a finger and then the finger tingles or hurts. Um,
[19:44.800 --> 19:49.800]  those nerves create or, or makeup or feel that they're getting signals.
[19:50.800 --> 19:51.720]  They're not really getting,
[19:52.120 --> 19:54.760]  and it can feel like it's tingling or tickling,
[19:54.760 --> 19:59.760]  or it can feel like it's on fire or stuck in a car door or it'll go numb.
[20:00.520 --> 20:04.360]  Um, and when I first stumbled on, uh, medical marijuana,
[20:04.360 --> 20:07.960]  that was one of the things I liked is it would help me ignore that sensation.
[20:08.560 --> 20:08.880]  Um,
[20:08.880 --> 20:13.880]  but it wasn't until I found something that was a good ratio with THC CBD that,
[20:14.120 --> 20:14.560]  uh,
[20:14.560 --> 20:19.240]  I really started to attack that inflammation and bring it down to a point where
[20:19.240 --> 20:21.120]  it doesn't hurt anymore. Um,
[20:21.160 --> 20:23.600]  like it's hard to explain to somebody when you're at work and they're like,
[20:23.600 --> 20:25.880]  why are you rubbing your hand? And it's like, well,
[20:25.880 --> 20:30.440]  because the three small fingers are numb and the,
[20:30.480 --> 20:33.360]  my thumb and my index finger feel like they're stuck in a car door.
[20:33.800 --> 20:37.080]  And it was like that when I woke up and I can't make it go away. But like,
[20:37.080 --> 20:38.680]  which jacket did you want to try on?
[20:40.160 --> 20:43.000]  It's just one of those things that sucks that you just have to deal with.
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.880]  And until I found something with that really helped that inflammation, um,
[20:46.880 --> 20:49.720]  I was just taking random pills that the doctor gave me and going to the
[20:49.740 --> 20:53.240]  chiropractor and the pills didn't do a fucking thing other than mess with my
[20:53.240 --> 20:58.000]  stomach and my liver. But the chiropractor was helping some. Um,
[20:58.120 --> 21:00.960]  but when I found something that's half THC, half CBD,
[21:00.960 --> 21:03.040]  that inflammation really started to come down.
[21:03.040 --> 21:06.960]  And I started having lower pain days, um,
[21:07.000 --> 21:10.600]  lower crazy sensation days. And then slowly,
[21:10.600 --> 21:15.600]  but surely I started getting pain free days and do those first couple pain free
[21:15.680 --> 21:19.680]  days were the dude, I was like, it was a teenager. Yeah. Like,
[21:19.760 --> 21:21.080]  I never happened.
[21:21.080 --> 21:23.160]  You got your endocannabinoid system back in line.
[21:23.920 --> 21:28.040]  And now that the rec industry has progressed to where it is. Um,
[21:28.080 --> 21:31.720]  there are several places in town where I can go in and pick up half THC,
[21:31.720 --> 21:34.320]  half CBD concentrates. And like,
[21:34.320 --> 21:37.400]  when I get home from the end of a long day and my knees are swollen a little
[21:37.400 --> 21:39.400]  bit and my feet hurt and my back hurts,
[21:40.120 --> 21:43.080]  I've eaten enough bowls of shit for the day. And I'm in kind of a foul mood,
[21:43.480 --> 21:46.000]  two or three dabs of that, um,
[21:46.020 --> 21:49.240]  will have me feeling like none of that happened physically. And, uh,
[21:49.260 --> 21:51.160]  it's just a wonder again for the day now.
[21:52.480 --> 21:56.440]  CBD for the win. Yeah. CBD Ramble. No, I love it. That's, that's,
[21:56.440 --> 21:58.240]  I that's why I brought you on for this episode.
[21:58.920 --> 22:03.120]  I go through a lot of this. Um, Doug, who's been on the episode before too.
[22:03.400 --> 22:05.760]  I saw Doug today. Shout out to Doug. Doug, you looked great today.
[22:05.760 --> 22:06.800]  It's good to see you doing well.
[22:07.760 --> 22:11.200]  Um, CBD has changed his life a hundred percent, right? Yes.
[22:11.280 --> 22:15.160]  Medical marijuana has saved Doug's life for sure. I don't know if I honestly,
[22:15.240 --> 22:18.280]  I, and it's, it's hard to think of stuff like this right now,
[22:18.280 --> 22:19.800]  cause we've lost a lot of people this year,
[22:19.800 --> 22:23.040]  but I don't know if Doug could still be here without medical marijuana.
[22:23.360 --> 22:26.600]  You know, mentally, spiritually, and physically,
[22:26.680 --> 22:31.120]  Doug would not be the same person without medical marijuana. I mean, I, I,
[22:31.120 --> 22:35.240]  I saw some of the same stuff I was going through in his world. Like, I mean,
[22:35.240 --> 22:37.800]  listeners, if you don't have a lot of pet,
[22:37.800 --> 22:39.760]  like physical pain in your life,
[22:39.760 --> 22:42.640]  or if you've never really been injured for a while, um,
[22:42.680 --> 22:47.680]  it's kind of hard to understand what people who do have nerve damage and pain
[22:47.760 --> 22:51.240]  like that go through. And it's the best way I can describe it. It's,
[22:51.240 --> 22:55.840]  it's like a, a sound and it gets louder and louder and louder.
[22:55.840 --> 22:59.200]  And as it gets louder, the world around you gets smaller.
[22:59.240 --> 23:01.320]  And that sound presses in on the world.
[23:01.320 --> 23:04.680]  And there are some days where there's nothing but that sound,
[23:05.280 --> 23:09.520]  like it's just pain. It doesn't matter that if you don't pick up the phone,
[23:09.520 --> 23:11.080]  you're not going to have a job later.
[23:11.480 --> 23:14.400]  It doesn't matter that you've got to go to the bathroom.
[23:14.440 --> 23:18.720]  It doesn't matter that you had something really important to do that day that you
[23:18.720 --> 23:22.000]  have to get up and go do now for, uh, or it's, you know,
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.880]  you're going to lose it forever. It doesn't matter. All there is, is the pain.
[23:25.480 --> 23:29.520]  Um, and you'll do anything to get away from it or make it stop for awhile.
[23:29.520 --> 23:33.000]  You'll give people a ridiculous sums of money because they claim to have a
[23:33.000 --> 23:38.160]  treatment that works. Um, and for the most part, nothing helps. Um,
[23:38.200 --> 23:41.720]  like I was wearing a thing that electrocuted me slowly, like a tens unit.
[23:42.240 --> 23:45.640]  And it works okay for some issues, but for mine,
[23:45.640 --> 23:49.960]  it was literally just the electrical shock that scrambled the pain impulse on
[23:49.960 --> 23:50.800]  the way to my brain.
[23:51.240 --> 23:55.840]  Like that was the best that Western science had for me. Um,
[23:55.880 --> 23:59.560]  and then one day I hit some, uh, high CBD, um,
[23:59.600 --> 24:04.160]  hash and about half an hour later I was like, wait a second,
[24:04.160 --> 24:08.120]  nothing hurts. Um, and I'd kind of drum my, both my hands on the table.
[24:08.120 --> 24:10.600]  And I was like, and I could feel on my fingers and none of them hurt.
[24:11.280 --> 24:13.320]  Like, what is that? Where did that come from?
[24:13.320 --> 24:17.960]  Where'd that guy with that vial of sticky shit go? Um, but yeah,
[24:17.960 --> 24:21.920]  it's a CBD is absolutely wonderful. Um,
[24:21.960 --> 24:25.120]  and a lot of people are starting to figure it out so much so that there's a lot
[24:25.120 --> 24:26.520]  of scam and fake shit around.
[24:26.640 --> 24:31.040]  Yeah. Unfortunately that Chinese imported CBD shit. That's not real.
[24:31.040 --> 24:35.480]  You're not buying stuff with a lab test on it from, uh,
[24:35.520 --> 24:38.880]  a very accredited retailer. You don't know what you're getting. Um,
[24:39.040 --> 24:44.120]  I'm sorry to inform you. Yeah. Unfortunately. Um, it's, uh,
[24:44.880 --> 24:48.680]  there's a lot of research going on into CBD right now. Um,
[24:49.320 --> 24:50.720]  hopefully in the next 10 years,
[24:50.720 --> 24:53.640]  we know a lot more about its medical applications, but, uh,
[24:54.040 --> 24:59.040]  I can vouch for its ability to calm a headache and a lower inflammation
[24:59.320 --> 25:03.560]  and swelling in your nerves or around your nerves and your joints so that, uh,
[25:03.600 --> 25:06.000]  those pain signals aren't just debilitating.
[25:06.080 --> 25:10.080]  I reduces vomiting and nausea. I feel like you're going to smoke some CBD.
[25:10.080 --> 25:12.480]  It'll take that away. It suppresses seizures.
[25:12.480 --> 25:15.360]  That's something we've talked about on the podcast before. Uh,
[25:15.520 --> 25:18.720]  it'll make you not have convulsions and seizures. Hopefully. Uh,
[25:18.720 --> 25:20.280]  that's like the most popular reason.
[25:20.280 --> 25:24.920]  Everyone, but it's, there's a several different forms of epilepsy, right? Um,
[25:24.960 --> 25:29.520]  that THC work on and that CBD work on. And then that the two together work on.
[25:29.880 --> 25:34.360]  That's a good, all that psychotic. Oh yeah. Uh, it'll, uh,
[25:34.400 --> 25:35.840]  stop here. It's, it doesn't stop.
[25:35.840 --> 25:40.200]  It will slow down your PTSD and your nightmares and your thoughts. Uh,
[25:40.200 --> 25:41.280]  if you have PTSD,
[25:41.640 --> 25:45.800]  I always sleep amazingly well when I've been consumed. Yes. CBD.
[25:45.960 --> 25:49.520]  I'd help with anxiety. It's an anti-inflammatory. We talked about that.
[25:49.520 --> 25:53.440]  It's an anti, uh, an antioxidant. It helps with degenerative disorders,
[25:53.460 --> 25:56.760]  which is pretty cool. It's acted as a protective, uh, an anti-tumor. It'll,
[25:56.840 --> 25:59.000]  it'll, it will not destroy your tumors.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.480]  I think you need THC to destroy a tumor slow, a tumor for sure. Um,
[26:03.520 --> 26:07.760]  there's a lot of very, very, very recent, um,
[26:07.760 --> 26:12.680]  cancer research on THC and CBD and CBD slows
[26:12.680 --> 26:17.640]  tumor growth majorly is what they're seeing in mice trials, um, which is huge.
[26:17.640 --> 26:21.840]  If, if, uh, if we can slow tumor growth, that gives us a better chance to fight.
[26:21.880 --> 26:26.400]  Yes. Yes. Um, the good news to that coin or that equation is that THC has been
[26:26.400 --> 26:30.800]  shown to kill it. Um, uh, which is kind of where the, you know,
[26:30.800 --> 26:35.360]  the, the first real medical research into Rick Simpson oil style products,
[26:36.160 --> 26:39.800]  um, that would be concentrates of both. Um,
[26:39.840 --> 26:43.000]  that's why those are so effective in the, um,
[26:44.360 --> 26:47.560]  a little bit big from that last tiny dab. I'm going to take a dab while you ramble.
[26:47.680 --> 26:51.080]  But as the, the medical research that we're starting to get, I mean,
[26:51.080 --> 26:53.800]  and it really is in its infancy folks.
[26:53.820 --> 26:57.520]  I'm not saying that if you have cancer and you find some of this,
[26:57.520 --> 27:01.920]  you can cure yourself real easy. That's not what I'm saying here. But, uh, um,
[27:01.920 --> 27:04.920]  the research is promising and honestly, in our lifetimes,
[27:04.920 --> 27:09.920]  we might see legitimate, um, package perfectly dosed.
[27:10.760 --> 27:14.000]  You've got this kind of cancer. We're going to start you on this much THC,
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.440]  this much CBD style.
[27:16.280 --> 27:21.200]  Exactly. Um, in our lifetime, which would be, Oh, that would make me so happy.
[27:21.240 --> 27:24.360]  Did you smell that dad that I just took a little bit? Oh, that smells,
[27:24.360 --> 27:28.320]  it tastes so good. I tasted a minute ago. That's the Turpex pineapple Jack.
[27:28.320 --> 27:31.880]  And then yeah, the nug run shatter. That was delicious. Yeah, man.
[27:32.360 --> 27:36.280]  Another thing I wanted to mention that CBD does, it's an antidepressant,
[27:36.320 --> 27:39.960]  which, you know, I think it it's got its own antidepressant properties,
[27:39.960 --> 27:42.080]  but also if a dude's not hurting every day,
[27:42.480 --> 27:44.040]  that's going to work as an antidepressant.
[27:44.040 --> 27:46.760]  If you're not having PTSD symptoms and panic attacks,
[27:46.800 --> 27:48.200]  you're going to be less depressed.
[27:48.520 --> 27:52.040]  I mean, honestly, most days when I wake up and I'm not hurting,
[27:52.080 --> 27:56.200]  it feels like my birthday still. Cause they're pretty rare. Um,
[27:56.220 --> 27:59.040]  most days I wake up at least a little stiff, a little sore,
[27:59.040 --> 28:03.440]  something somewhere screaming. You're only getting older. I know. Right. Well,
[28:03.440 --> 28:05.640]  when I was a teenager, I had more than one doctor go,
[28:05.640 --> 28:08.160]  if you don't knock this shit off, it's going to hurt when you're 30. Yeah.
[28:08.440 --> 28:11.200]  And I was like, shut up, put a cast on it. Yeah. Put a cast on it.
[28:11.200 --> 28:14.040]  I got shit to do. You gotta go. Um, where'd my rollerblades go?
[28:14.920 --> 28:16.280]  Early. Cause I got other shit to do.
[28:16.640 --> 28:19.200]  Like I was a teenager in Colorado in the nineties.
[28:19.200 --> 28:22.360]  We were still free to like ride our bikes off roofs and stuff.
[28:22.400 --> 28:24.480]  Remember like before everything was nerfed. Yeah.
[28:24.520 --> 28:26.920]  Before we were looking at fucking padded, bro. What the hell?
[28:27.080 --> 28:29.080]  Um, we didn't get trophies when our team didn't win.
[28:29.080 --> 28:31.000]  Like kids are going to be a bunch of pussies in the future.
[28:31.120 --> 28:34.480]  It was the last generation that really got that. Yeah.
[28:34.560 --> 28:37.000]  We're the same age. We took full advantage here. We're the same age.
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.480]  I was right there with you.
[28:39.440 --> 28:41.680]  But, uh, I remember more than one doctor going,
[28:41.680 --> 28:46.160]  it's going to hurt when you're 30 and they were all right. It does. Um,
[28:46.200 --> 28:51.280]  but the days that are pain free, most of those I can credit to last night I was,
[28:51.320 --> 28:53.080]  I was hurting a little, I knew I was hurting.
[28:53.080 --> 28:58.000]  So I consumed a whole lot of THC CBD concentrate instead of my normal mix of
[28:58.440 --> 29:02.080]  predominantly THC, flour and shatter. And, uh,
[29:02.520 --> 29:06.600]  I wake up feeling a lot better, um, really restful sleep.
[29:07.360 --> 29:10.120]  Um, and, uh, really,
[29:10.120 --> 29:13.240]  really nice work on the inflammation while I sleep.
[29:14.040 --> 29:18.720]  One thing we should totally mention is CBD buyers by itself will not get you
[29:18.720 --> 29:22.360]  high. No, you can consume a lot of CBD and you may get a little grin,
[29:22.480 --> 29:25.640]  but I don't think you're going to get like any psychedelic psychoactive effect.
[29:25.680 --> 29:30.400]  It's not a high. The, the mood improvement is like you were saying,
[29:30.400 --> 29:35.200]  when the pain goes away, your mood goes up a thousand times. Like it, I mean,
[29:35.200 --> 29:36.840]  if you don't know what I'm talking about,
[29:37.280 --> 29:40.520]  think about getting a bee sting when you get that stinger pulled out or a
[29:40.520 --> 29:41.520]  splinter pulled out,
[29:41.920 --> 29:45.400]  or you've got a big painful zit that finally pops like in that relief of
[29:45.400 --> 29:50.320]  pressure. Um, imagine that like through your whole arm,
[29:50.360 --> 29:54.480]  like if your whole arm felt like it was on fire and then one moment it stopped
[29:54.560 --> 29:58.000]  feeling like that and just felt like your arm again. Um,
[29:58.240 --> 30:00.920]  the sensation's incredible. When we finally get there,
[30:00.960 --> 30:02.720]  you know how well it's working.
[30:04.320 --> 30:09.400]  Uh, another thing, uh, that we can talk about is CBD will reduce
[30:09.440 --> 30:12.320]  the effects of THC. So if you're a little too high,
[30:12.560 --> 30:13.920]  if you've had too many dabs,
[30:13.920 --> 30:17.280]  if you're new and you take a big giant dab of THC and you're just spinning,
[30:17.280 --> 30:18.120]  you're fucked up.
[30:18.600 --> 30:21.280]  You take a little dab of CBD and it will calm you down a little bit.
[30:21.280 --> 30:22.320]  It'll balance out your high.
[30:22.360 --> 30:26.000]  There's a, some company that made a product, they were calling it rescue pills.
[30:26.520 --> 30:31.120]  And it was just a CBD caps CBD filled gel cap. That's pretty cool. Um,
[30:31.160 --> 30:32.080]  to yeah. If your,
[30:32.120 --> 30:34.600]  your buddy took too many dabs and they're freaking out a little bit,
[30:34.600 --> 30:38.240]  just hand them this and you know, give him a hug for half an hour.
[30:39.040 --> 30:42.560]  Wait for this to kick in a little bit. Some Doritos and he'd be just fine. Um,
[30:42.840 --> 30:47.320]  a friend of mine makes a, for a relative of his that he's a caregiver for,
[30:47.320 --> 30:50.080]  he makes CBD capsules. Um,
[30:50.120 --> 30:53.520]  and he does something to the oil to make it a little more bioavailable.
[30:53.960 --> 30:57.720]  And I was taking those at night for a while. I had a few and Oh good Lord,
[30:57.720 --> 31:00.400]  did I feel wonderful next day? Um,
[31:00.440 --> 31:05.040]  just pain free and, and just in a really, really nice mood.
[31:05.040 --> 31:06.040]  It was really nice.
[31:06.320 --> 31:09.720]  There are a couple of companies that are making CBD dog treats,
[31:09.760 --> 31:12.800]  which I think is really cool because a lot of the shepherd breeds are known for
[31:12.800 --> 31:15.080]  their dysplasia and hip problems. Uh,
[31:15.120 --> 31:18.320]  there's a shepherd dog that stayed at my house for a little while now and he gets
[31:18.320 --> 31:21.640]  some CBD treats occasionally and he seems to be a happy little dog.
[31:21.800 --> 31:24.280]  It doesn't seem to cause him any problems and it's going to keep him pain free.
[31:24.280 --> 31:25.360]  Keep his little hips happy.
[31:25.800 --> 31:30.800]  I've got a, um, a Malamute that's a push in four or 13 and a half.
[31:31.440 --> 31:36.320]  Now she's almost 14. Um, breed expect life expectancy is eight. Um,
[31:36.320 --> 31:41.320]  and so her knees, her, her ankles, uh, print basically every joint is shot.
[31:41.840 --> 31:45.040]  And you can see it when she doesn't want to go up and down the stairs.
[31:45.040 --> 31:49.200]  I've been adding a little THC CBD tincture to her food. Um,
[31:49.200 --> 31:52.840]  and the days that I added, she's five years younger. Nice. Um,
[31:52.840 --> 31:57.080]  you can see it helping with the pain and the inflammation. Um, uh,
[31:57.120 --> 31:59.440]  it takes about 20 minutes, half an hour to kick in for her.
[32:00.120 --> 32:01.680]  And you can see the change overnight.
[32:02.480 --> 32:06.080]  I had five or six customers come in looking for something for their dogs before
[32:06.080 --> 32:08.120]  I thought to try it. And yeah, I'm glad I did.
[32:08.600 --> 32:12.360]  Yeah. There are companies that are making specific edibles for dogs. Now, uh,
[32:12.360 --> 32:15.640]  there are things available at hemp stores that have CBD for your dog that are
[32:15.640 --> 32:18.840]  made in America with actual hemp products. Um, there,
[32:19.120 --> 32:22.000]  I can't say there's anything wrong with that as long as it's made with real,
[32:22.080 --> 32:23.840]  real hemp or real cannabis.
[32:23.920 --> 32:28.360]  Yeah. Basically if it's sold in a brick and mortar retailer in the United States,
[32:28.360 --> 32:33.360]  it has to at least, uh, contain what the label says. Um,
[32:33.520 --> 32:38.480]  recently the, the DEA just sent out a thing to a bunch of CBD only companies.
[32:39.120 --> 32:41.680]  Um, and the internet kind of freaked out and was like, Oh,
[32:41.680 --> 32:44.720]  they're just attacking weed. Like they always do. And it was,
[32:44.720 --> 32:48.320]  they were targeting the people that are selling like codfish oil and calling it
[32:48.320 --> 32:50.360]  CBD oil because people don't know any better.
[32:50.560 --> 32:54.360]  And you can't take this stuff to a lab and get it tested as a civilian. Yeah.
[32:54.880 --> 32:57.200]  You're just getting scammed out of money on the internet.
[32:57.200 --> 33:00.960]  So be careful if you're ordering online folks, but this, uh, the,
[33:01.360 --> 33:04.360]  if you've got a number of different ailments, um,
[33:04.400 --> 33:07.960]  you should get online and check out and see if there's any research on what THC
[33:07.960 --> 33:10.800]  and CBD can do for those for your specific ailment. Yeah.
[33:10.880 --> 33:12.960]  And then check out the laws in your state and see if,
[33:13.120 --> 33:14.640]  if and where you can get this stuff.
[33:15.000 --> 33:17.240]  And if you have to come take a vacation in Colorado,
[33:17.640 --> 33:20.800]  I see a lot of the people doing exactly that. They come,
[33:20.840 --> 33:25.840]  they visit at one of our rec stores and a good rec store will have a decent
[33:26.320 --> 33:29.520]  selection of CBD products at this point. Um,
[33:29.560 --> 33:32.960]  they might not have a huge selection or a wide selection,
[33:32.960 --> 33:34.040]  but they should have some.
[33:34.160 --> 33:36.320]  And you can go to more than one store while you're here.
[33:36.320 --> 33:39.080]  So you'll find what you need several to check out weed maps.
[33:39.080 --> 33:42.120]  You can check out leafly. There are menus available to see what you want.
[33:42.120 --> 33:44.880]  Unfortunately on the mobile apps, they cannot show you pricing anymore.
[33:45.480 --> 33:46.840]  Did they take that off the mobile? Yeah.
[33:46.840 --> 33:48.720]  All the pricing has gone on all the mobile apps,
[33:48.720 --> 33:50.800]  but you can still find them on the web. If you use your computer,
[33:51.520 --> 33:56.200]  it's a weed maps.com and leafly L E A F L Y.
[33:56.480 --> 33:57.600]  If you're coming to Colorado,
[33:57.760 --> 34:00.440]  I think those are effective in all the marijuana States. Yeah.
[34:00.680 --> 34:02.000]  Pretty much nationwide now. Yeah.
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.400]  So if you want to search for locations of your favorite,
[34:04.480 --> 34:07.320]  favorite strains or products or topicals or whatever you're looking for,
[34:07.360 --> 34:09.920]  go to those websites and you can find information on the products you're
[34:09.920 --> 34:13.480]  looking for and you can find specific locations that have them. Uh,
[34:13.640 --> 34:17.040]  don't get mad at me if a dispensary does not update their weed maps menu.
[34:17.040 --> 34:18.280]  Sometimes they forget.
[34:18.320 --> 34:22.280]  What I was about to say is like the weed maps and leafly are great places to
[34:22.280 --> 34:27.160]  start your search. But if you're looking for a very specific product, um,
[34:27.240 --> 34:28.800]  or even kind of a general product,
[34:28.800 --> 34:32.640]  you're looking for something with a certain ratio of cannabinoids, some THC,
[34:32.640 --> 34:36.640]  some CBD, something like that. Um, check out weed maps, relief,
[34:36.640 --> 34:40.720]  we make a list of possible shops and then go ahead and give them a call and just
[34:40.960 --> 34:45.200]  real quick ask them, Hey, what's your, your selection of blah. Yeah. What do you,
[34:45.200 --> 34:49.480]  what do you have in for CBD options right now? Yeah. Black pick pens. Yeah.
[34:49.480 --> 34:54.600]  But like be specific in what you're looking for as much as you can. Um,
[34:54.680 --> 34:58.200]  and then, uh, narrow your list that way because I mean,
[34:58.200 --> 35:00.240]  the industry is weird right now and uh,
[35:00.640 --> 35:03.720]  you never know when somebody is going to walk in and say, give me all of that.
[35:04.240 --> 35:04.800]  So, uh,
[35:04.800 --> 35:07.760]  what's on their menu might not have anything to do with what's on their store
[35:07.760 --> 35:09.040]  shelf at this moment.
[35:09.560 --> 35:12.440]  It might just be stuff that's been on the store shelf in the last 30 days.
[35:12.520 --> 35:15.880]  I was shopping at green and healthy the other day and I was frustrated because I
[35:15.880 --> 35:17.040]  wanted to, uh,
[35:17.120 --> 35:20.880]  I bought something and the guy behind me was frustrated because I'd purchased
[35:20.920 --> 35:25.440]  all of it and he said, I want that. And she had to say, it's gone.
[35:25.440 --> 35:28.560]  And he said, why is it on the list? And she's like, he just bought all of it.
[35:28.600 --> 35:30.520]  Sorry. So that's how quickly she can sell out.
[35:30.520 --> 35:32.560]  I bought an ounce and I cleaned them out. I took the bottom of that.
[35:32.680 --> 35:37.560]  I watched a dude buy 160 things, a hard candies one time. Um,
[35:37.960 --> 35:39.240]  and it was just like, okay,
[35:39.260 --> 35:44.000]  let me get you a box and sweep all of these into the box.
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.000]  And like for the rest of the week we had to tell people, sorry,
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.960]  we're out of that particular product line. And they were like,
[35:49.960 --> 35:52.520]  is there something wrong with it? And it's like, no,
[35:53.520 --> 35:56.280]  it was something amazing with it. Apparently, honestly, every,
[35:56.320 --> 35:59.240]  every month I've worked in a dispensary that's happened with at least one
[35:59.240 --> 36:00.840]  product line once. I mean,
[36:00.840 --> 36:03.680]  sometimes it's only the last eight or 10 or 20 units or whatever,
[36:03.680 --> 36:06.840]  but it happens. I used to go to, you went with me,
[36:06.880 --> 36:11.080]  we went to the clinic in Denver and they had Durban poison wax. Yep. Uh,
[36:11.120 --> 36:15.800]  and they had vortex wax. I loved from the clinic, uh, on Mexico in Denver,
[36:15.800 --> 36:17.600]  it's still open. They don't have these products anymore.
[36:17.600 --> 36:19.200]  They've changed their game, but they used to have,
[36:19.200 --> 36:23.000]  this was like three and a half years ago. Oh man. It was amazing. Uh,
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.520]  the vortex tasted like cranberries and dirty feet and rotten fruit.
[36:27.720 --> 36:31.040]  I don't know why you like that feet smell. Oh man. I just love that in my weed,
[36:31.040 --> 36:34.120]  but the high that he gave me, I couldn't focus on anything.
[36:34.120 --> 36:36.920]  It made my eyes jump around. Like I was on a bumpy road.
[36:37.200 --> 36:40.360]  Like it was really crazy. And that Durban poison, just,
[36:40.440 --> 36:42.320]  I love the flavor of good Durban poison wax.
[36:42.320 --> 36:44.720]  And that head high is just so amazing. So back in the day,
[36:44.720 --> 36:48.160]  we'd go to the clinic and I would save up as much money as I could afford to
[36:48.160 --> 36:49.440]  save up. And I'd walk in there and I'd say,
[36:49.440 --> 36:50.960]  how much of that Durban poison do you have?
[36:50.960 --> 36:53.600]  And they'd say there's about 14 grams and I'd say, I'll take it.
[36:54.040 --> 36:56.040]  And then I'd say, how much of that vortex do you have?
[36:56.040 --> 36:59.280]  And they'd usually have somewhere between 14 and 28 grams. I would buy it.
[36:59.680 --> 37:01.960]  Like I would clean it out. And the guy behind me would be like, Oh yeah,
[37:01.960 --> 37:04.000]  he bought a lot of that. I want some. And they'd be like, sorry,
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.360]  he bought all of it.
[37:05.920 --> 37:09.120]  No, I did it the other day with those delicious truffles. I, uh,
[37:09.200 --> 37:11.240]  they cut me off eventually. They thought I was flipping it,
[37:11.240 --> 37:13.160]  but I was really, I was smoking that shit. I love it.
[37:13.840 --> 37:16.600]  Two and a half hours away from my house at the time I had to go stock up.
[37:17.200 --> 37:17.320]  Yeah.
[37:17.320 --> 37:21.160]  I got the last four boxes of Coda and I watched the lady behind me come in and
[37:21.160 --> 37:25.800]  go, Hey, do you guys sell this? Whoops. Whoopsie. Um, but yeah,
[37:25.800 --> 37:29.920]  so forgive a shop if they don't have something that they did have advertised on
[37:29.920 --> 37:33.320]  their weed maps menu, but yeah, a good shop's going to keep that mostly updated,
[37:33.320 --> 37:37.200]  but you're going to want to call and double check. Yeah. Uh, something pro tip.
[37:37.440 --> 37:39.520]  I don't say pro tip ever, but if you want to sound like,
[37:39.520 --> 37:44.480]  you know what you're talking about? Don't say CBDs say CBD.
[37:44.640 --> 37:49.160]  Yeah. It's cat, boy, dog, or the initials. There's not an apostrophe S.
[37:50.200 --> 37:54.280]  The way I look at it, you don't say THCs. This strain has a lot of THCs in it.
[37:54.280 --> 37:56.080]  You say this strain has a lot of THC.
[37:56.080 --> 37:58.200]  Why would you say this strain has a lot of CBDs?
[37:58.200 --> 38:02.360]  To the American public like Sanjay Gupta fucked that up on his weed special.
[38:02.440 --> 38:05.680]  Oh, I didn't catch that. I didn't realize it was Sanjay that did that to us.
[38:05.720 --> 38:07.600]  No, it wasn't him that started it,
[38:07.600 --> 38:11.560]  but like it's a common mispronunciation or, or yeah,
[38:11.600 --> 38:14.360]  mispronunciation would be correct. Just CBD. You guys there,
[38:14.520 --> 38:16.360]  you wouldn't say I want a glass of waters.
[38:16.400 --> 38:20.200]  You just say I want a glass of water and you know that there's a lot of water in
[38:20.200 --> 38:20.420]  there.
[38:20.420 --> 38:23.960]  There's a measurement with that contains a specific amount of water and you're
[38:23.960 --> 38:25.080]  looking for CBD,
[38:25.080 --> 38:29.080]  not CBDs because it's not a group of things. It is.
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.760]  It's just one thing. It's CBD. Um, and you don't, you don't say CHCs.
[38:34.120 --> 38:37.320]  Nope. You don't say corns. I want some corns. You say, I want some corn.
[38:37.640 --> 38:39.240]  They don't eat cereals. You eat cereal.
[38:40.360 --> 38:44.160]  No, it's one of those things we did here that like Sadova and Indigo that when
[38:44.160 --> 38:45.840]  you're here, just cringe.
[38:45.840 --> 38:48.480]  We're going to do an episode in the future about Sativa and Indica and the
[38:48.480 --> 38:52.200]  differences and the benefits and balances and the growing styles and everything
[38:52.200 --> 38:54.640]  of each. So we'll talk about Sadova, Sadova and Indigo's
[38:57.600 --> 39:02.600]  Sativa and Indica you guys and, and Eno type P H E N O T Y P E
[39:03.480 --> 39:04.600]  Fino type.
[39:04.600 --> 39:06.040]  While we're on it, strain.
[39:06.240 --> 39:07.800]  So yo my gosh, you want to do that?
[39:07.800 --> 39:10.680]  I saw a hilarious post the other day on social media that was like,
[39:10.680 --> 39:15.680]  I love all those 90% THC strands out there. Oh man. I just about died.
[39:15.920 --> 39:16.320]  Laughing.
[39:16.320 --> 39:17.640]  Shout out to my boy Cooper Watts.
[39:17.640 --> 39:22.320]  He made a short educational video on the difference between strain and strand.
[39:22.600 --> 39:25.440]  Uh, strands are ropes or fibers. Uh,
[39:25.520 --> 39:29.280]  strains are different varieties of cannabis. If you want to be technical,
[39:29.280 --> 39:32.800]  you can call it a varietal or a cultivar, but let's,
[39:32.800 --> 39:36.080]  let's go with strain instead of strand as a start you guys.
[39:36.600 --> 39:38.960]  And it's a trichome and not try Chrome.
[39:40.760 --> 39:43.880]  I get that one a lot. I think we've gone on long enough. So one thing,
[39:45.960 --> 39:49.520]  the more you know, bump bump bump, because knowing is half the battle.
[39:49.680 --> 39:52.560]  Yes, it is. Battle. That was a good segue. Speaking of battle. Uh,
[39:52.560 --> 39:57.400]  I wanted to talk about Nate Diaz from the UFC and UFC 202.
[39:57.400 --> 40:00.720]  Wait, GI Joe reference, right? Tonight. There you go, bro. There you go.
[40:00.720 --> 40:04.720]  Real American hero. Yeah. Uh, I'm not going to talk about my opinion of the fight.
[40:04.720 --> 40:06.680]  That doesn't matter. But those dudes threw the fuck down.
[40:07.760 --> 40:11.600]  They went, they went to the end. It was a, it was a, it was a decision.
[40:11.600 --> 40:13.080]  It ended with them both standing.
[40:13.080 --> 40:15.560]  So they beat the shit out of each other for 25 minutes.
[40:15.600 --> 40:19.280]  Fuck out of each other from the, the, I didn't see the fight,
[40:19.280 --> 40:22.400]  but I did see the press conference we're about to talk about and Holy shit.
[40:22.400 --> 40:24.680]  He looked like a side of beef getting ready to hit the, yeah. Yeah.
[40:24.680 --> 40:28.240]  He got punched in the face a lot of times. Connor McGregor has got some punches.
[40:28.680 --> 40:32.680]  Um, so one thing I want to talk about when they're interviewing him,
[40:32.840 --> 40:37.720]  dude, just straight pulls out a vape pen and starts taking vape pen rips.
[40:38.040 --> 40:40.480]  And one of the repo, I've got the video here. Let's just play this video.
[40:40.480 --> 40:41.760]  It's only a couple of seconds longer.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.880]  I'm just gonna play this video and then we'll talk for a couple of seconds and
[40:44.880 --> 40:46.200]  we'll wrap up this podcast. But
[40:47.240 --> 40:50.600]  as a pen, he pulls out just so you guys know, if you haven't seen the video,
[40:50.600 --> 40:55.160]  it's a, your standard, um, concentrate vape pad. Um,
[40:55.200 --> 40:58.160]  I've got a million different versions of this on a, on the store shelf.
[40:58.200 --> 41:01.760]  I work at, I'm going to bring the volume up slowly. So I'm going to start back
[41:01.760 --> 41:05.320]  here. He hired all top 10 people to come in.
[41:05.760 --> 41:07.200]  Here it comes. Here comes the part we want to hear.
[41:09.720 --> 41:12.040]  What exactly are you just for the record smoking?
[41:14.360 --> 41:19.000]  This is true. It's true. The true company. It's a,
[41:19.800 --> 41:24.080]  CBD. It helps with a healing process and, uh,
[41:24.120 --> 41:25.680]  inflammation and stuff like that.
[41:25.680 --> 41:30.320]  So you want to get these for before after the fire training and make your life a
[41:30.320 --> 41:35.240]  better place. And then one last one, um, CBD, CBD oil.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.040]  If you don't know what that is, a big part of this story.
[41:39.320 --> 41:42.280]  Do you hear that? The key right there, make your life a better place.
[41:42.480 --> 41:43.320]  That's what he said.
[41:46.120 --> 41:49.080]  That's beautiful. I couldn't have said it better, man. I didn't realize it.
[41:49.080 --> 41:51.640]  I've watched this video several times. He fucked up where he said, uh,
[41:51.680 --> 41:53.480]  it's good to use before and after the fight.
[41:53.480 --> 41:56.320]  He shouldn't have said before the fight fucked up right there, buddy. But still,
[41:56.560 --> 42:00.400]  well, there there's, he might be in a ton of trouble for doing that. Yeah.
[42:00.440 --> 42:02.880]  That's what, that's what I wanted to talk about. I'm glad you said that.
[42:03.200 --> 42:06.560]  It's a, the specific rules, uh,
[42:06.600 --> 42:10.600]  bar cannabis consumption period. Um,
[42:10.720 --> 42:14.440]  until six hours after the fight, um,
[42:14.480 --> 42:17.960]  is what I was reading in random press coverage of this. I like,
[42:17.960 --> 42:19.040]  I don't follow the sports.
[42:19.040 --> 42:20.400]  That makes sense in all of their rules.
[42:20.720 --> 42:22.680]  Catch that from my intro to this story.
[42:22.720 --> 42:27.440]  Is that you saw to rules or is that rules from the local governing
[42:27.480 --> 42:31.240]  sporting agency? It was rules with an S in the news article. I read it all.
[42:31.240 --> 42:34.480]  I know. I'm sorry. I'm just, I almost said rules with a Z,
[42:34.480 --> 42:38.400]  but I honestly don't know whose rules they are,
[42:38.400 --> 42:41.880]  but MMA fighters can't use any sort of cannabis product until,
[42:41.920 --> 42:43.920]  or any sort of banned substance,
[42:43.920 --> 42:47.600]  which marijuana or cannabis products would be on the list until six hours after
[42:47.600 --> 42:49.840]  the fight. I'm pretty sure I already know your answer here,
[42:49.840 --> 42:54.000]  but do you think a dude that just spent 25 minutes of his night getting kicked
[42:54.080 --> 42:57.840]  in the dick and punched in the face should be allowed to take a couple of rips
[42:57.840 --> 42:59.680]  off a CBD vape pen at the end of the night?
[42:59.720 --> 43:03.880]  Almost most assuredly. Um, I'd offer him a dad's dad,
[43:03.880 --> 43:04.920]  but this wonderful half and half.
[43:05.560 --> 43:08.080]  He could dab all of this gram that's left over if he wanted my
[43:08.880 --> 43:09.360]  beating like that.
[43:09.360 --> 43:12.800]  Anything that's going to help you recover faster and deal with that level of
[43:12.800 --> 43:15.360]  trauma is encouraged by me.
[43:15.440 --> 43:18.760]  He says it reduces inflammation and swelling. And that dude,
[43:18.880 --> 43:21.000]  his face looked like a jack-o'-lantern.
[43:21.400 --> 43:23.240]  It did. And honestly, I, uh, I, uh,
[43:23.840 --> 43:28.440]  I incur or applaud his use of anything other than a heavy narcotics is what these
[43:28.440 --> 43:31.760]  guys are. Usually isn't that what they usually throw at them? You know, I don't,
[43:31.760 --> 43:35.560]  I don't know what they do to deal with the pain at the end of that. But, uh,
[43:35.600 --> 43:36.800]  Nate Diaz did make a joke.
[43:36.800 --> 43:40.440]  He said I'm going to a party and Conor McGregor is going to the hospital.
[43:40.480 --> 43:44.040]  I don't know how accurate that was because Nate Diaz looked like he had his face
[43:44.040 --> 43:47.840]  punched in. Uh, I'm, I can't even talk about who I feel like won that fight.
[43:47.840 --> 43:50.760]  That doesn't matter at all on this podcast. Uh, that's not what we're here for.
[43:50.920 --> 43:52.000]  All I didn't see it.
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.760]  All I know is that Nate Diaz took a hell of a beating and that during the press
[43:56.760 --> 43:59.960]  conference, he was ripping a CBD, blatantly ripping it too.
[43:59.960 --> 44:03.400]  He looked to like two or three big fat rips off of it. Uh,
[44:03.440 --> 44:07.360]  so he didn't cough like I do. Yeah. Right. No, he took it like a champ.
[44:07.960 --> 44:09.520]  He doesn't smoke cigarettes all day, bro.
[44:10.440 --> 44:13.800]  Not, I thought that was the key to his success was tobacco.
[44:14.160 --> 44:16.440]  So I think, yeah, that's what makes him the MMA fight.
[44:16.440 --> 44:17.600]  It makes him tough as nails.
[44:17.640 --> 44:19.960]  That's where the nickname Weezy comes from, right? Yeah.
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.160]  They call him young Weezy. So I feel like this dude should, I think,
[44:24.160 --> 44:26.280]  I feel like every athlete,
[44:26.280 --> 44:29.440]  I feel like almost everybody should be allowed to consume. See everybody.
[44:29.480 --> 44:32.240]  Why not? Let's look at CBD.
[44:32.240 --> 44:36.880]  Weedekit was about last night. The, the new episode that aired was, uh, um,
[44:36.960 --> 44:41.320]  medical marijuana use in the NFL to deal with, um,
[44:41.800 --> 44:44.080]  the chronic concussion syndrome or whatever it's called.
[44:44.080 --> 44:48.040]  I know it helps. I'm, I'm a victim of a head injury. And I know that that,
[44:48.040 --> 44:51.240]  see, we talked about that 42 minutes ago. Yep. That,
[44:51.240 --> 44:55.240]  that definitely that CBD changed my life and it helped me get out of my funk
[44:55.240 --> 44:58.080]  that I had. I mean, the episode wasn't focused on CBD,
[44:58.080 --> 45:01.240]  but that's sort of what they were inching at is part of the story that we're
[45:01.240 --> 45:04.640]  telling was THC and CBD are both neuroprotectants.
[45:04.680 --> 45:06.080]  My next question was going to be,
[45:06.080 --> 45:10.680]  do you think that cannabis use is a performance enhancing
[45:10.680 --> 45:11.520]  drug?
[45:12.520 --> 45:13.840]  What's this performance?
[45:15.280 --> 45:18.960]  I'm fighting, kicking people, fighting UFC, fighting. How about football?
[45:19.480 --> 45:23.960]  No, not, not performance enhancing at all. How about injury recovery enhancing?
[45:24.080 --> 45:28.480]  How about basketball? No, no. I'm trying to play devil's advocate here.
[45:28.520 --> 45:33.040]  How about video games? Yeah. Yeah. I feel like when I smoke, uh, if I,
[45:33.200 --> 45:35.280]  I haven't played video games in a long time, um,
[45:35.320 --> 45:37.640]  there's a lot of things where I would put it on the yes list.
[45:37.680 --> 45:42.000]  But see then in my mind, since I am so comfortable, I've got ADD,
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.080]  my mind wanders. You can tell by listening to the podcast,
[45:44.080 --> 45:46.320]  my mind just fucking darts around all over the damn place.
[45:47.720 --> 45:50.280]  When I smoke some hash, it does help me focus a little bit.
[45:50.400 --> 45:53.080]  There's a moment there for the first fucking 10 minutes where my brain just
[45:53.080 --> 45:57.400]  spins. But once it lands back in its place, uh, I'm pretty well focused.
[45:57.480 --> 45:58.320]  And so,
[45:58.320 --> 46:01.600]  I mean I've got mild ADD as well and that's one of the things I've always
[46:01.600 --> 46:04.720]  enjoyed about cannabis is it helps, um,
[46:05.040 --> 46:07.160]  slow down the, the sporadic.
[46:07.160 --> 46:10.920]  I can shoot pool better. I could shoot basketball better. I could probably,
[46:10.920 --> 46:11.800]  I don't play football.
[46:11.800 --> 46:16.480]  I could probably throw my football with more accuracy after I took a couple of
[46:16.480 --> 46:21.160]  dabs. Uh, I'm a musician. I've played drums for 20 years.
[46:21.160 --> 46:24.240]  I've had drum lessons. I've been on tour. I've played in big bands.
[46:24.240 --> 46:28.440]  I played in small bands. Sometimes smoking a little weed makes me play a little
[46:28.440 --> 46:31.400]  better. Sometimes smoking a little weed fucks me up to tell you the truth.
[46:31.400 --> 46:32.240]  So I don't know.
[46:33.960 --> 46:37.760]  Unless you're talking about like just helping the,
[46:37.760 --> 46:42.760]  the athlete or the performer tune out other distractions and focus on the
[46:42.760 --> 46:46.560]  competition in the moment. Um, I don't see it, you know,
[46:46.560 --> 46:48.840]  making you run faster and jump higher.
[46:48.840 --> 46:51.080]  And that's what I think of when I think of performance enhancer.
[46:51.400 --> 46:52.220]  In the UFC,
[46:52.220 --> 46:53.840]  you're packing yourself full of blood so that your,
[46:53.840 --> 46:55.760]  your heart can move more oxygen.
[46:55.760 --> 46:59.040]  Like taking more testosterone. So I'm faster, meaner, leaner, quicker.
[46:59.040 --> 47:02.560]  Right. A steroid so that you have more physical muscle mass,
[47:02.600 --> 47:04.680]  but like THC doesn't do any of that.
[47:04.680 --> 47:08.160]  It doesn't make me able to kick you in the face any harder.
[47:08.160 --> 47:09.880]  It doesn't make me give you more damage.
[47:09.880 --> 47:13.000]  It helps me recover from that face kick faster,
[47:13.480 --> 47:17.320]  but like that's not a performance enhancer. That's a recovery enhancer.
[47:18.080 --> 47:19.760]  Like that's very different.
[47:20.080 --> 47:22.280]  Dude, if I was UFC fighter and like,
[47:22.280 --> 47:25.040]  we're gearing up for the fight and the music's going and Rogan's all out there.
[47:25.160 --> 47:27.760]  Oh my God, this is the fight of the fucking night.
[47:27.760 --> 47:31.600]  Everybody in Rogan's just going nuts with his bald head and his fucking too much
[47:31.600 --> 47:34.160]  alpha brain. Does your mouth have a little dab?
[47:35.720 --> 47:38.520]  Mouthpiece attachment. I'm a fighter, right? I'm a UFC fighter. I'm getting,
[47:38.560 --> 47:41.720]  I got my fucking hand wraps on. I got my gloves. I got my tape coming on.
[47:41.720 --> 47:43.320]  I got my gloves on. I got my ankle wraps on.
[47:43.320 --> 47:45.560]  Cause I got these long chicken legs and they come out and they're like,
[47:45.560 --> 47:47.280]  Ross and Jeff, you got to fight in 30 seconds.
[47:47.280 --> 47:49.960]  You ready for your pre-show dab? And I'm like, let's get it.
[47:49.960 --> 47:53.400]  And they dropped me like a half a gram of some pineapple Jack nug run shatter on
[47:53.400 --> 47:57.040]  there. And I blow it out. You know what I want to do after that? Not fight.
[47:57.480 --> 48:00.360]  I don't know how these, right? How do you smoke?
[48:00.680 --> 48:02.760]  How do you medicate and want to fight at all?
[48:02.760 --> 48:06.920]  Well, no, I'm just, see, this is how little MMA I watch.
[48:07.160 --> 48:10.360]  Can you couldn't manipulate? No, you can manipulate the rig. Huh?
[48:10.400 --> 48:12.680]  Cause the, they need their fingers to grapple.
[48:13.840 --> 48:16.360]  I was thinking boxing style where you can't hold the rig.
[48:16.360 --> 48:19.680]  So you've got one manager holding up the smoke, buddy.
[48:19.680 --> 48:22.760]  One manager holding up the rig and other manager working the nail and the carb
[48:22.760 --> 48:26.120]  cap. Yeah. Um, that seems complicated for a pre-fight dab.
[48:26.120 --> 48:29.200]  I would use one of those, uh, the hit man, hinge nails with
[48:31.440 --> 48:33.160]  so you can do it with one hand. I can do it with my glove on.
[48:33.160 --> 48:34.000]  I've figured this out.
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.160]  Do the announcer's microphone comes down Jeff's rig comes down.
[48:37.240 --> 48:39.800]  I am one of those guys that if there's a dab to be taken,
[48:39.800 --> 48:44.520]  I will make sure it happens. I'm the dab diver. That's awesome.
[48:44.560 --> 48:47.920]  I'm glad we got to work the Nate Diaz clip into this episode. That was great.
[48:48.080 --> 48:50.200]  I saw that and I was so blown away. I was like,
[48:50.200 --> 48:51.760]  that's gotta be Photoshopped.
[48:51.760 --> 48:55.680]  And I clicked the volume on it and they start talking about it and I was blown
[48:55.720 --> 48:59.000]  away. Yeah. He was super ballsy. Um,
[48:59.040 --> 49:01.680]  shout out to Nate Diaz for representing cannabis and right now,
[49:01.920 --> 49:03.120]  kind of a pretty cool way.
[49:03.120 --> 49:07.520]  A tough decision loss to he goes up all chest out proud to lead the way about
[49:07.600 --> 49:12.520]  medical cannabis and how beneficial he's in no way like politically correct or
[49:12.520 --> 49:14.760]  gentle. No, he's just balls to the wall.
[49:15.560 --> 49:18.920]  I just got kicked in the fucking head. I'm going to smoke some CBD to help it out.
[49:18.920 --> 49:21.760]  It's going to help. Don't be mad at me. That's cool. I like that.
[49:21.760 --> 49:25.120]  But both of those brothers are going to end up banned from the UFC and banned
[49:25.120 --> 49:27.240]  from fighting for life if they keep playing the way that they do.
[49:27.240 --> 49:29.640]  And that's going to be terrible because I like to see their performances.
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.880]  Yes, you guys, it is random. I'm a dreadlocked, hippie, rust, a farian dude,
[49:33.880 --> 49:36.560]  but I love to watch some UFC. I think about it this way.
[49:36.800 --> 49:38.920]  Those dudes weigh 200 pounds and they're fucking jacked.
[49:38.920 --> 49:42.200]  They've got more testosterone and then their body than most people should have.
[49:42.200 --> 49:43.200]  And they want to break shit.
[49:43.240 --> 49:45.120]  I'm glad that they're in that cage breaking each other.
[49:45.160 --> 49:49.000]  Then out at the bar or at the dab lounge trying to break me. Yep. Uh,
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.320]  I condone that go to battle in that cage. Let's see it. That's cool.
[49:52.360 --> 49:53.600]  That's skill. Jiu Jitsu.
[49:53.760 --> 49:57.920]  We've both known people who were just built to brawl. Yeah.
[49:58.320 --> 50:00.560]  That's just, yeah. Some people are here to drum.
[50:00.560 --> 50:02.880]  Some people are here to high five. Some people are here to brawl.
[50:02.920 --> 50:07.480]  We've all got our skill. Um, and it's good that they have an outlet.
[50:07.480 --> 50:10.800]  And I'm a fan of MMA. I just don't care enough to pay attention.
[50:11.120 --> 50:15.960]  I think I am accidentally an MMA fan because of Joe Rogan and because of
[50:15.960 --> 50:19.440]  Joey Diaz and it all rubbed off. Yeah. It just rubs off.
[50:19.440 --> 50:22.240]  Eddie Bravo, too many Joe Rogan experience.
[50:22.240 --> 50:26.000]  And puts out the fight companion tour him and a bunch of his friends.
[50:26.120 --> 50:27.600]  And I also listened to fighter in the kid.
[50:27.600 --> 50:29.800]  So that's more MMA that gets pumped into my head.
[50:29.800 --> 50:32.880]  But they put out a fight companion where two guys from fighter and the kid and
[50:32.880 --> 50:36.600]  Eddie Bravo and Joe Rogan sit around and they watch the UFC and they talk about
[50:36.600 --> 50:39.200]  what's going on and they drink beer and smoke weed and get fucked up and talk
[50:39.200 --> 50:40.040]  shit to each other.
[50:40.040 --> 50:43.760]  But they're watching the UFC and they tell you like in the match, they're like,
[50:43.760 --> 50:48.240]  all right, round three of this match, we were at 29, 28, 27 seconds.
[50:48.240 --> 50:51.040]  And you can sync up your computer and watch that video.
[50:51.280 --> 50:54.400]  And so it's almost weirdly like you're hanging out with Rogan and the crew
[50:54.400 --> 50:55.240]  watching the fight.
[50:55.640 --> 50:57.800]  I'll see. I'll watch it if it's on somewhere I'm at,
[50:57.840 --> 51:01.520]  but I don't like actively pay attention. Yeah. Um, I pay more,
[51:01.560 --> 51:03.600]  like if I'm over at your house and it's on the,
[51:03.600 --> 51:06.480]  it'll get more attention out of me than like football or basketball would.
[51:07.600 --> 51:10.520]  I, uh, I, I took a little karate when I was a youngster.
[51:10.520 --> 51:14.160]  So I've always been fascinated with that type of skills to Kung Fu San Su for
[51:14.160 --> 51:17.000]  several years. And then Kong Su Do karate for even longer.
[51:17.240 --> 51:20.960]  I was just impressed that he was repping CBD. Um,
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.560]  and I liked that he had a little CBD vape pen that was set up like an open or
[51:24.760 --> 51:29.440]  any of the other major vape companies. Um, just rip it on some CBD oil.
[51:29.720 --> 51:32.840]  It took like two or three good, maybe three or four good rips. All right, Mike,
[51:32.840 --> 51:35.440]  we've been rambling for almost an hour. I think it's time to wrap up this show.
[51:35.440 --> 51:36.280]  What do you think?
[51:36.280 --> 51:40.680]  Miss any other points on CBD? We covered as basic medical applications. Um,
[51:40.720 --> 51:42.440]  I crossed out all the stuff on my list,
[51:42.440 --> 51:47.440]  except popular CBD strains so that if people wanted to grow cannabis that was
[51:47.560 --> 51:52.480]  high in CBD, um, just a few strains I would recommend anything, uh,
[51:52.560 --> 51:56.960]  Harlequin, Canna, tonic, Harla, Sue, Tora, Sue,
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.080]  Tora Bora, AC DC.
[51:59.160 --> 52:02.800]  The tour board is really wonderful folks that I've had a lot of personally.
[52:02.880 --> 52:04.480]  And I know I went over that list really quickly.
[52:04.480 --> 52:05.680]  Those were just off the top of my head.
[52:06.080 --> 52:09.960]  The other thing I'd like to touch on, I think before we wrap this one up is, uh,
[52:10.600 --> 52:14.800]  um, for at least for the pain and inflammation that I'm dealing with,
[52:15.440 --> 52:20.440]  THC and CBD together in roughly 50 50 mix work two or 300 times better than CBD
[52:24.800 --> 52:28.120]  alone or THC alone. Um,
[52:28.160 --> 52:32.760]  the two of them together works. It's not one plus one equals two. Um,
[52:32.760 --> 52:36.040]  it's one plus one equals seven. And as far as I'm concerned, um,
[52:36.040 --> 52:39.640]  the effect is amplified greatly. Cool. Last man. Um, no,
[52:39.640 --> 52:42.200]  it's wonderful when you, when you mix THC and CBD,
[52:42.440 --> 52:45.240]  the medical applications are wonderful. Um,
[52:45.280 --> 52:48.200]  sorry if I sound a little stoned and I am pretty tired, but, uh,
[52:48.720 --> 52:52.320]  I feel clear headed. I feel, um, like alert and present.
[52:52.800 --> 52:56.040]  We're going to fix that. True. When I got here, I was hurting so bad. I, uh,
[52:56.200 --> 52:58.760]  I seriously almost didn't come folks and I really like it. And I didn't,
[52:58.760 --> 53:00.400]  almost didn't come cause my head was pounding.
[53:00.520 --> 53:02.160]  I'm glad you made it bro. I'm glad you pulled through.
[53:02.160 --> 53:04.000]  I'm glad those CBD dabs fixed you up. Yeah.
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  I should have just started dabbing CBD earlier in the day. I just, uh,
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.400]  I was out and about and didn't get a chance all day.
[53:09.480 --> 53:12.760]  That's how life goes. Sometimes you got to get home and get the dab rig going,
[53:13.000 --> 53:13.200]  bro.
[53:13.200 --> 53:16.640]  Remind everybody how they can follow you on social media and absolutely remind
[53:16.640 --> 53:18.000]  us about your Facebook page.
[53:18.120 --> 53:22.040]  You can catch me on Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[53:22.040 --> 53:26.080]  Give us a like comment, share. Um, we really appreciate that.
[53:26.080 --> 53:30.840]  We're a reaching more and more people every week on that. It's a, I mean, the,
[53:31.040 --> 53:36.040]  the viewers that I get per week spike and change topic to topic,
[53:36.200 --> 53:38.840]  but, uh, as we've been getting close to the election,
[53:38.840 --> 53:41.320]  the view counts been going up steady and it's been nice.
[53:41.720 --> 53:44.560]  And I like to think this show has something to do with it. Um,
[53:44.560 --> 53:46.120]  so if you're checking us out from the show,
[53:46.120 --> 53:48.840]  go ahead and send me a message to say hi. Um,

[54:01.600 --> 54:04.360]  and a shout out to Barry. Oh, I'm glad you liked the last episode.
[54:04.440 --> 54:06.440]  Fast Barry. What's up, buddy? Thanks for listening, bro.
[54:06.440 --> 54:09.240]  You've been listening to the podcast since the beginning. I appreciate that.
[54:09.280 --> 54:11.600]  And we see those messages, man. We appreciate it. Yes, we do.
[54:11.600 --> 54:13.480]  We see all of those messages. You guys,
[54:13.480 --> 54:15.960]  if you send me a message and I have not responded to your message yet,
[54:16.000 --> 54:20.400]  I'm getting to it. Trust me. We do one episode a week. I get 20 messages a week.
[54:20.400 --> 54:23.400]  I have tried to filter out my favorite or the most relevant for what's going on
[54:23.400 --> 54:25.920]  in our lives right now. That's how I handle the emails.
[54:26.160 --> 54:28.400]  So I'll be back with more episodes, with more email content.
[54:28.400 --> 54:30.440]  I love the listener generated content.
[54:30.440 --> 54:33.320]  That lets me know that I'm getting the information to the people that need the
[54:33.320 --> 54:36.480]  information. I'm giving them exactly what they want. Makes me feel great.
[54:36.760 --> 54:39.400]  We, uh, we know way too much about cannabis folks.
[54:39.400 --> 54:44.400]  And we spend hours debating which little nugget of our,
[54:44.600 --> 54:48.560]  our vast cannabis intellect to share with the listeners this night. And it's,
[54:48.560 --> 54:53.000]  uh, when we have an email that's like, Hey, I was wondering how to blah it,
[54:53.040 --> 54:57.960]  uh, it sparks some awesome conversations. Some of my favorite episodes, man,
[54:57.960 --> 55:01.600]  our, uh, listeners with specific growth questions. Absolutely.
[55:01.840 --> 55:03.760]  Um, we're able to dig in.
[55:03.800 --> 55:06.560]  I'll be going through the phone and I'll get an email and it'll say a show
[55:06.560 --> 55:09.880]  question and I'll read it. And you can see me light up like, Oh yeah.
[55:09.920 --> 55:13.120]  Cause now I get to ramble for 45 minutes about one of my favorite things and I
[55:13.120 --> 55:15.840]  know a whole bunch about, so it always makes me good to get those messages.
[55:15.920 --> 55:19.960]  And honestly, from where we are in Colorado, especially here in Pueblo,
[55:19.960 --> 55:24.960]  it's hard to understand what you need to know now in Florida or Georgia or
[55:27.240 --> 55:31.320]  wherever you have in Australia, we have listeners all over the place. Um,
[55:31.360 --> 55:35.960]  and so you send it in a question that lets us know where you're at and how we
[55:35.960 --> 55:39.160]  can help you helps us clue in on the information to give you.
[55:39.160 --> 55:42.000]  And I absolutely love those episodes. There's so much fun to do.
[55:42.120 --> 55:46.400]  The last two email episodes were fantastic. I've got plenty more coming guys.
[55:46.400 --> 55:47.760]  Don't be afraid to send me some emails.
[55:47.760 --> 55:49.640]  Don't be discouraged if I haven't replied to you.
[55:49.920 --> 55:52.680]  I get so many messages that it's honestly overwhelming.
[55:52.680 --> 55:54.040]  Somebody told me to hire an intern.
[55:54.320 --> 55:56.920]  I said that that would be bullshit because it's all about talking to me.
[55:56.920 --> 55:59.400]  They don't want to talk to my intern. They don't want a pre-typed answer.
[55:59.400 --> 56:02.280]  They want to actually communicate with me. I do my best to do that.
[56:02.280 --> 56:05.200]  I try to keep up with it because if you don't know how to get in touch with me,
[56:05.520 --> 56:07.880]  this is how you do it. If you have a question for the podcast,

[57:01.480 --> 57:03.240]  flowers and pollen on top of it.
[57:03.240 --> 57:05.920]  It dropped little flowers and the pollen dumped on there and it's already
[57:05.920 --> 57:09.800]  showing seeds. Uh, that picture got, uh, 400 and something,
[57:09.800 --> 57:11.600]  50 something likes at the last time I looked,
[57:11.600 --> 57:13.480]  it's probably close to five or 600 by now.

[57:19.720 --> 57:20.680]  thank you for coming dude.
[57:20.720 --> 57:25.200]  Yeah, man. Uh, I had to, for the CBD episode, that's honestly what, uh,
[57:25.240 --> 57:27.920]  what the final decision maker for leaving the house and coming over and doing
[57:27.920 --> 57:32.560]  the show was, was, um, I wanted to do another good episode about CBD. The, you,
[57:32.920 --> 57:36.920]  uh, uh, myself and Doug did one a while back. Yes.
[57:36.920 --> 57:40.520]  And I've had Fox on a couple of times. Yeah. You've done two with Fox,
[57:40.880 --> 57:44.560]  which were really good. Bookie J Fox run CBD crew. Um, yeah,
[57:44.560 --> 57:47.680]  that was my, who I was hinting at when you said, let's do a CBD episode.
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.200]  We want a third and you were like, no, let's just do a, you and me showed her.
[57:51.480 --> 57:55.760]  He lives in Denver now, so it's harder to get with him. Yeah. Um, but, uh,
[57:56.520 --> 58:01.320]  he's sort of the CBD, um, go to that. I know of down here when I have a CBD
[58:01.320 --> 58:05.520]  question, that's who I send a message to. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right, you guys.
[58:05.600 --> 58:08.680]  Yeah. If you guys have CBD questions or any other questions, please hit us up.
[58:09.000 --> 58:10.720]  Any questions at all. You guys, we're going to get out of here.
[58:10.720 --> 58:13.760]  It's time for us to take some fat dads. Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[58:13.880 --> 58:17.360]  And until next time, take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me.
[58:18.680 --> 58:23.080]  We used to aim for the sky. Now we hired a Mars on the rise till we shine like
[58:23.080 --> 58:33.640]  the fire of stars. I create you admire it. Slamming beats makes the whole house
[58:33.640 --> 58:38.200]  want to bounce like static sheets. We did track elite world star athletes and
[58:38.200 --> 58:41.800]  you can't compete because your rap is weak. Have a seat. My numbers game is
[58:41.800 --> 58:46.120]  uncontained by a data sheet. I run the game while you drag your feet. I'm
[58:46.400 --> 58:50.120]  unashamed with my love for fame because my life was mundane. Now it's feeling
[58:50.120 --> 58:53.680]  magnafic. First place and we move in the book.
[58:54.880 --> 59:00.200]  Under the influence of drugs, you speak. We could ruin your mom. Oh, you the boss.
[59:00.240 --> 59:04.480]  I could squash you like a ball. Do it again. Do it. Then do it again.
[59:04.640 --> 59:08.200]  Because the moment that you stop is when the movement will end. So do it again.
[59:08.360 --> 59:12.800]  Do it. Then do it again. I give a fuck who the truth will offend. Go do it.
[59:13.360 --> 59:18.080]  Go do it. Then do it again. Loyal to music. No wonder why I'm losing my friends.
[59:18.640 --> 59:23.400]  You don't do it. You move with the trend. Pretend you do it while I do it again.
[59:24.040 --> 59:28.280]  You can't stop what I do with the pen. Make the impossible probable and do it
[59:28.280 --> 59:33.640]  again. I'm the beginning. True to the end. Constantly winning. All you do is
[59:33.640 --> 59:38.680]  defend. In the lab, writing theories of rhyme. Clearly defined. Dedicating
[59:38.680 --> 59:43.960]  serious time. You can't seek what you're weary to find. You can't copy what
[59:43.960 --> 59:48.440]  you hear me to sign. My whole life's a rhyme on the page. I'm kind of enraged
[59:48.520 --> 59:52.520]  that I've spent minimal time on the stage. But I don't want to play myself
[59:52.520 --> 59:56.080]  like some five minute craze. If I was a phase, I'd probably put a nine to my
[59:56.080 --> 01:00:00.280]  face and go, wow, blow out my whole brain like Cobain. The moment that he
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:04.240]  realized he sold out. But fuck depression. I ain't fixing to fall. I'm
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:08.760]  a come with progression and I'll give it my all. Do it again. Do it. Then do it
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.320]  again. Because the moment that you stop is when the movement will end. So do
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:16.560]  it again. Do it. Then do it again. I give a fuck who the truth will defend.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:22.160]  Go do it. Go do it. Then do it again. Loyal to music. No wonder why I'm losing
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.760]  my friends. You don't do it. You move with the train. You can pretend you do
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.160]  it while I do it again.
