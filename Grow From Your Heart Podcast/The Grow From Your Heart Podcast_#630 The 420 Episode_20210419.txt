[00:00.000 --> 00:06.280]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[00:06.280 --> 00:07.280]  I'm your host.
[00:07.280 --> 00:12.120]  My friends call me Ross DeGeoff, and this is episode 630 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:12.120 --> 00:13.320]  podcast.
[00:13.320 --> 00:16.240]  This is the special 420 celebration episode.
[00:16.240 --> 00:17.440]  Happy 420.
[00:17.440 --> 00:19.240]  This episode comes out on April 19th.
[00:19.240 --> 00:22.640]  I hope you are ready to celebrate on 420 with us.
[00:22.640 --> 00:28.040]  For my 420 celebration this year, I invited a bunch of friends to join me on a Zoom meeting.
[00:28.040 --> 00:30.080]  I had about 25 friends show up.
[00:30.080 --> 00:32.160]  Big shout out to everybody that joined us.
[00:32.160 --> 00:33.200]  We talked about cannabis.
[00:33.200 --> 00:34.960]  We talked about the cannabis industry.
[00:34.960 --> 00:36.080]  We talked a little shit.
[00:36.080 --> 00:37.360]  I edited some of it out.
[00:37.360 --> 00:38.800]  I left a little bit of it in.
[00:38.800 --> 00:40.000]  I hope you guys enjoy it.
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.760]  I don't want to make a really long intro because the show is really, really long.
[00:43.760 --> 00:58.310]  So with no further ado, here is the 420 celebration episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:58.310 --> 01:00.030]  Really quickly, welcome to the 420 show.
[01:00.030 --> 01:01.030]  Thanks to everybody that showed up.
[01:01.030 --> 01:03.110]  Some will come, some will go, more will show up.
[01:03.110 --> 01:05.150]  I'm going to quickly try to do intros.
[01:05.150 --> 01:06.950]  Now I feel Dirtman Dan's pain.
[01:06.950 --> 01:09.830]  Getting through intros on like 12 screens is going to be a fun adventure here.
[01:09.830 --> 01:11.950]  But I see Dirtman Dan looking at me.
[01:11.950 --> 01:17.550]  Dirtman Dan, really quickly, can you tell us where you're located and how we can stalk you on social media?
[01:17.550 --> 01:18.030]  All right.
[01:18.030 --> 01:19.310]  So I'm Dirtman Dan.
[01:19.310 --> 01:21.750]  I'm over here on the East Coast.
[01:21.750 --> 01:27.830]  You can find me on social media at DirtmanDanOrEmbracingOrganics.
[01:27.830 --> 01:30.310]  On Instagram, right?
[01:30.310 --> 01:30.630]  All right.
[01:30.630 --> 01:31.070]  All right.
[01:31.070 --> 01:31.270]  Yeah.
[01:31.270 --> 01:31.950]  Thank you for joining me, bro.
[01:31.950 --> 01:33.510]  It's fun being on Embracing Organics.
[01:33.510 --> 01:35.150]  You inspired this madness here.
[01:35.150 --> 01:37.430]  So this is all your fault.
[01:37.430 --> 01:41.430]  Let's follow that up by introducing the first dreadlock that showed up to the party.
[01:41.430 --> 01:44.110]  Let's welcome my buddy Steve, also known as PotentPonics.
[01:44.110 --> 01:45.230]  Where are you joining us from, Steve?
[01:45.230 --> 01:47.790]  And how can people stalk you on social media?
[01:47.790 --> 01:48.030]  Sure.
[01:48.030 --> 01:49.910]  I'm joining you guys from Oklahoma this week.
[01:49.910 --> 01:51.630]  I travel around quite a bit.
[01:51.630 --> 01:56.750]  And you can find me at either 8pmjclass.com or GrowingWithFishesPodcast.
[01:56.750 --> 02:00.550]  On your favorite podcast app, we have all the different,
[02:00.590 --> 02:03.830]  separate platforms that are out there.
[02:03.830 --> 02:06.630]  You know, so whatever you use, check it out.
[02:06.630 --> 02:06.990]  Check them out.
[02:06.990 --> 02:08.710]  I highly endorse the PotentPonics podcast.
[02:08.710 --> 02:11.470]  Also fully endorse that Embracing Organics podcast.
[02:11.470 --> 02:14.470]  Another fellow podcaster on the panel who's lighting up a fatty over there,
[02:14.470 --> 02:18.950]  a new friend of mine known as Sequence from the Michigan Bros Grow show.
[02:18.950 --> 02:19.670]  That's a mouthful.
[02:19.670 --> 02:20.430]  Welcome to the show, brother.
[02:20.430 --> 02:23.750]  You want to tell everybody where you're joining us from and how they can stalk you tonight?
[02:23.750 --> 02:24.950]  Yeah, I'm joining from Michigan.
[02:24.950 --> 02:29.070]  And yeah, we didn't intend the podcast getting big enough that people would have to say the name.
[02:29.070 --> 02:30.350]  Major oversight on our part.
[02:30.350 --> 02:33.470]  But yeah, you can find us at Michigan Bros Grow Show on YouTube.
[02:33.470 --> 02:36.270]  And my own Instagram doesn't really matter that much.
[02:36.270 --> 02:37.070]  Thank you for having me, Jeff.
[02:37.070 --> 02:37.990]  Appreciate it very much.
[02:37.990 --> 02:38.790]  Thanks for joining us, bro.
[02:38.790 --> 02:40.470]  Thank you for being here for the 420 show.
[02:40.470 --> 02:42.910]  I'm going to keep moving down the line in the direction I've got it.
[02:42.910 --> 02:45.630]  I want to welcome my buddy, Genetic Memory Farms.
[02:45.630 --> 02:48.590]  You might be quiet, but welcome to the show, bro.
[02:48.590 --> 02:49.270]  Thanks, Jeff.
[02:49.270 --> 02:49.470]  Thanks.
[02:49.470 --> 02:50.550]  I appreciate you having us.
[02:50.550 --> 02:52.150]  All of us here from the neighborhood just stopping in.
[02:52.150 --> 02:55.470]  So yeah, I really appreciate you making a platform for the community, man.
[02:55.470 --> 02:58.150]  Thank you very, very much and appreciate you having us.
[02:58.150 --> 02:58.550]  Thank you, bro.
[02:58.950 --> 03:00.950]  Where are you coming in from tonight?
[03:00.950 --> 03:03.350]  Oh, I'm locking down the Midwest.
[03:03.350 --> 03:04.070]  I'm from Illinois.
[03:04.070 --> 03:06.670]  So I'm one of the weirdos here in the Midwest, kind of the third coast.
[03:06.670 --> 03:12.110]  So if I can be helpful to anybody with food, I'm in the food industry by trade.
[03:12.110 --> 03:13.630]  So my kind of thing is food science.
[03:13.630 --> 03:17.230]  If anybody's got any questions, hit me up on IG, Genetic Memory Farms.
[03:17.230 --> 03:17.750]  There we go.
[03:17.750 --> 03:18.910]  Thanks for joining us, brother.
[03:18.910 --> 03:21.270]  I'm going to keep moving to my right.
[03:21.270 --> 03:23.790]  A fellow podcaster who I see on everybody's show.
[03:23.790 --> 03:26.070]  I want to welcome my buddy Raptor to the show.
[03:26.070 --> 03:27.110]  Raptor, where are you joining us from?
[03:27.110 --> 03:28.110]  How do we stalk you, bro?
[03:28.110 --> 03:29.830]  Hey, how's it going, everyone?
[03:29.830 --> 03:32.070]  Thank you so much for inviting me, Jeff.
[03:32.070 --> 03:34.550]  I am from Southern California.
[03:34.550 --> 03:38.230]  I've been growing for almost four years just about now.
[03:38.230 --> 03:40.630]  And yeah, I just kind of delved into it.
[03:40.630 --> 03:46.430]  And once I started learning, got into more, I wanted to major in it.
[03:46.430 --> 03:52.350]  So that's where I am now, getting all into that right in the middle of all my schooling too.
[03:52.390 --> 03:57.230]  Just like Jeff mentioned, I'm on a, you can see me here and there on a couple of podcasts,
[03:57.230 --> 04:04.430]  but yeah, mainly I'm helping out P Operation Grow along with Schwoop and having a good time.
[04:04.430 --> 04:07.670]  Saturdays, 1pm Pacific Standard Time.
[04:07.670 --> 04:09.950]  Yeah, you could also find them on YouTube, Operation Grow.
[04:09.950 --> 04:15.470]  We go live there and we'll actually be doing a collaborative effort with the neighborhood.
[04:15.470 --> 04:17.630]  I'm really excited for that.
[04:17.630 --> 04:19.510]  We're going to have a 420 special.
[04:19.510 --> 04:25.230]  Probably you're all going to be seeing that hopefully when this recording is available.
[04:25.230 --> 04:31.350]  So yeah, you could find us at The Neighborhood Grows at Instagram and at YouTube.
[04:31.350 --> 04:33.030]  Awesome, bro. Thank you for joining us.
[04:33.030 --> 04:37.630]  Oh, and you can find me specifically, Raptor Grow, all one word, Instagram.
[04:37.630 --> 04:39.630]  Perfect. He's got the little Raptor as a logo.
[04:39.630 --> 04:41.910]  I want to ask about that, but there's too many people to talk to right now.
[04:41.910 --> 04:42.670]  We'll move on.
[04:42.670 --> 04:45.430]  I think who I have next, I got Cuz up next on the list.
[04:45.430 --> 04:46.830]  Cuz, thank you for joining me, bro.
[04:46.830 --> 04:50.190]  Where are you coming from and how can we stalk you on the social media?
[04:50.190 --> 04:51.710]  Cheers. Thanks for having me.
[04:51.710 --> 04:53.510]  Coming in from the West Coast of Canada.
[04:53.510 --> 04:56.630]  Might be one of the... Oh, no, we got a couple of Canadians on here today.
[04:56.630 --> 04:58.070]  Yeah, we do.
[04:58.070 --> 04:59.190]  My name's Cuz I Love It.
[04:59.190 --> 05:01.870]  Yeah, you can find me on YouTube and Instagram.
[05:01.870 --> 05:04.390]  I'm also involved in The Neighborhood Grows.
[05:04.390 --> 05:06.710]  You'll find me there also with YouTube and Instagram.
[05:06.710 --> 05:09.630]  And The Grow 4 Show, which is a Canadian-based,
[05:09.630 --> 05:13.790]  trying to help small Canadian legal growers with their four plants.
[05:13.790 --> 05:15.710]  You'll find me there as well.
[05:15.710 --> 05:17.110]  Thanks for teaching people, bro. Thank you.
[05:17.110 --> 05:17.430]  For sure.
[05:17.430 --> 05:20.430]  I got to keep these intros going because more people are popping in as I do intros.
[05:20.430 --> 05:22.350]  We're never going to get through these.
[05:22.350 --> 05:23.950]  So I'm going to move right over to my buddy, Duckweed.
[05:23.950 --> 05:28.070]  Duck, where are you coming in from, bro, and how can we stalk you on social media?
[05:28.070 --> 05:29.110]  Oh, cheers, everyone.
[05:29.110 --> 05:30.950]  I am Duckweed.
[05:30.950 --> 05:34.430]  I'm coming all the way from fucking Caribbean,
[05:34.430 --> 05:37.190]  a little island called Trinidad and Tobago.
[05:37.190 --> 05:41.430]  We just kind of decriminalized and in the whole process of doing shit,
[05:41.430 --> 05:44.950]  just about a little over a year now.
[05:44.950 --> 05:50.590]  So yeah, looking forward to this cool hangout with all you crazy stoners.
[05:50.590 --> 05:53.630]  Again, thanks, Jeff, for putting this together and inviting us all.
[05:53.630 --> 05:57.630]  You can find me at nutsandguts868 on Instagram.
[05:57.630 --> 06:00.950]  And other than that, same like Raptor mentioned,
[06:00.950 --> 06:04.550]  and a couple of other guys would mention The Neighborhood Grows Show,
[06:04.550 --> 06:06.190]  also The Operation Grows Show.
[06:06.190 --> 06:08.710]  So yeah, peace, love, and respect.
[06:08.710 --> 06:10.510]  Thank you, bro. Thanks for joining us all the way from over there,
[06:10.510 --> 06:11.870]  staying up late to hang out.
[06:11.870 --> 06:13.910]  Yeah, so good.
[06:13.910 --> 06:16.230]  Let's move on to one of my favorite partners in crime,
[06:16.230 --> 06:17.990]  a guy that's been on my podcast quite a few times,
[06:17.990 --> 06:19.790]  a familiar face to everybody.
[06:19.790 --> 06:20.830]  Mike, thanks for joining us, bro.
[06:20.830 --> 06:22.590]  You want to tell everybody where you're joining from?
[06:22.590 --> 06:26.230]  And maybe you might want to let them know how to stalk you on the social media.
[06:26.230 --> 06:30.590]  Joined it from big bad Pueblo, Colorado, just like always.
[06:30.590 --> 06:33.870]  And if you want to stalk me on social media, check me out at Twitter.
[06:33.870 --> 06:40.710]  You can find me at NemoPunk15 or on Facebook at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[06:40.710 --> 06:42.750]  Excellent. Thanks for being quick, bro.
[06:42.750 --> 06:46.870]  Now let's move over to somebody who I've been doing a lot of fun stuff with,
[06:46.870 --> 06:48.190]  the guy that runs Cannabuzz,
[06:48.190 --> 06:50.870]  the guy responsible for a big part of the cannabis community.
[06:50.870 --> 06:51.870]  I think we all know where to find him,
[06:51.870 --> 06:53.350]  but we'll give him a chance to introduce himself.
[06:53.350 --> 06:55.230]  Q, you want to tell us where you're coming in from
[06:55.230 --> 06:58.350]  and give us a little bit of info about Cannabuzz?
[06:58.350 --> 07:01.510]  Hey, everyone. Thanks so much, Jeff, for inviting me.
[07:01.510 --> 07:05.070]  I really appreciate it. And shout out to White Mike as a listener of the show.
[07:05.070 --> 07:11.910]  It's cool to be on the same Zoom as this, the Wonder Twins or whatever you want to call them.
[07:12.510 --> 07:14.750]  Yeah. Anyways, I'm Q Groves.
[07:14.750 --> 07:17.670]  You can find me on Instagram as well as Cannabuzz.
[07:17.670 --> 07:20.790]  I co-founded Cannabuzz with JR Token,
[07:20.790 --> 07:26.270]  who you may know from the Dude Groves crew and many other things.
[07:26.270 --> 07:32.670]  And yeah, Cannabuzz is a cannabis social network and cannabis community of over 115,000 people.
[07:32.670 --> 07:35.430]  Many of them are on this Zoom and elsewhere.
[07:35.430 --> 07:40.590]  So I just want to shout out to you all and appreciate you all and hope you all have a great 420.
[07:40.590 --> 07:41.590]  Thank you, bro. Thank you.
[07:41.590 --> 07:43.990]  I got to keep going on these intros because I'm never going to get caught up.
[07:43.990 --> 07:47.110]  There are 20 people in here now. I think I'm a quarter of the way through here.
[07:47.110 --> 07:49.070]  So thanks for joining me, Q. Sorry to be so quick.
[07:49.070 --> 07:50.910]  Stabby, now is your time to shine, brother.
[07:50.910 --> 07:55.950]  Would you like to tell people where you're coming in from and how you can be stocked on the social media?
[07:55.950 --> 08:05.030]  Usually I try not to be found, but if you do want to hear me rant and rave about like red worms or just organic growing in general,
[08:05.030 --> 08:08.630]  there's a couple of years worth of that on the Embracing Organics channel.
[08:08.670 --> 08:10.270]  And recently I've been...
[08:12.510 --> 08:15.390]  You muted yourself. I didn't do it.
[08:15.390 --> 08:17.230]  That was me, fat finger. Sorry about that.
[08:17.230 --> 08:22.430]  But recently I've been honored to be a guest on the Michigan Grows Bro Show.
[08:22.430 --> 08:24.390]  Just works out a little bit better for my schedule.
[08:24.390 --> 08:27.550]  You know, I got a family life, got a full time job and all that.
[08:27.550 --> 08:30.830]  And sometimes I'll pop up on Cannabuzz with updates.
[08:30.830 --> 08:33.350]  Usually I keep it pretty low key, though.
[08:33.350 --> 08:34.430]  It's good to hear from you.
[08:34.430 --> 08:38.390]  It's good to know that you're over there on the Michigan Bros Grow Show.
[08:38.390 --> 08:40.030]  Plenty of podcasting for everybody.
[08:40.030 --> 08:41.470]  I'll have to go check it out more often.
[08:41.470 --> 08:42.830]  It is. Well, everything you're involved in.
[08:42.830 --> 08:48.670]  If you're looking for me, if you're trying to find me, I'm on the Ivory Army Discord.
[08:48.670 --> 08:51.190]  Oh yeah. Shout out to everybody in the Discord.
[08:51.190 --> 08:52.870]  Half the people here, I think, are on that Discord.
[08:52.870 --> 08:53.910]  So thank you for mentioning that.
[08:53.910 --> 08:57.950]  We've built a great community over there and huge shout out to Greybeard.
[08:57.950 --> 08:59.510]  He deserves all the credit in the world.
[08:59.510 --> 09:01.390]  He puts in so much work over there.
[09:01.390 --> 09:02.750]  He's such a good dude.
[09:02.750 --> 09:03.790]  Super chill.
[09:03.830 --> 09:09.870]  And daily, there are just people in there, hanging, chilling, talking, grow, talking.
[09:09.870 --> 09:11.430]  I mean, we get crazy in there sometimes.
[09:11.430 --> 09:12.710]  It's pretty cool.
[09:12.710 --> 09:16.390]  Just out there conversations, man, with like-minded individuals.
[09:16.390 --> 09:18.670]  It's really good. It's a good community.
[09:18.670 --> 09:21.870]  Yeah, I have to close the app at night because I just hear you go bleep, bleep, bleep,
[09:21.870 --> 09:23.030]  because you guys are just always chatting.
[09:23.030 --> 09:25.030]  You got to modify your notifications.
[09:25.030 --> 09:26.470]  Just modify your notifications.
[09:26.470 --> 09:27.630]  I like it.
[09:27.630 --> 09:28.630]  All right, Savvy. Thank you, bro.
[09:28.630 --> 09:30.590]  We're going to move on and we'll talk more about Discord in a minute.
[09:30.590 --> 09:32.230]  But I got about 10 more people to get through
[09:32.230 --> 09:34.550]  and then we're going to turn this party into a smoke sesh.
[09:34.550 --> 09:39.590]  Let's move up more toward Canada and introduce my buddy, a fellow grower, Mr. Shwooby Dooby Doo.

[10:07.670 --> 10:09.470]  a big contributor to the Canada Buzz.

[10:40.310 --> 10:43.830]  another huge contributing factor of the Ivory Army, a guy that I call The Ridge.
[10:43.830 --> 10:46.150]  If you join us on YouTube and you see somebody moderating people,
[10:46.150 --> 10:49.390]  if you got kicked out of the YouTube chat, it was this guy that did it.
[10:49.390 --> 10:51.110]  Let's welcome my buddy, Perp, to the show.

[11:25.710 --> 11:29.590]  So let's move it right on through and go to more of my Canadian friends.
[11:29.590 --> 11:31.750]  Let's pick up my buddy, Shipwreck, for a minute.

[13:29.230 --> 13:31.190]  We're making some segues, some headway here.
[13:31.190 --> 13:34.710]  I got a new friend here on the screen, somebody I've never met face to face, but a long-time
[13:34.710 --> 13:35.930]  supporter of the Ivory Army.
[13:35.930 --> 13:38.630]  Rocking the Ivory gear, putting a smile on my face.
[13:38.630 --> 13:40.590]  Looks like somebody that honestly would have just been in my crew.
[13:40.590 --> 13:41.910]  I'm not one to judge a book by its cover
[13:41.910 --> 13:45.350]  But me and this guy definitely would have rode around at the band together got some fucking trouble
[13:45.350 --> 13:48.770]  I want to welcome my buddy red-eyed Jedi grows to the show brother
[13:48.770 --> 13:52.270]  You want to let us know where you're coming in from and tell us how we can stalk you on that social media
[13:53.830 --> 13:55.830]  Great to be here happy 420
[13:56.310 --> 14:02.750]  You can find me on Instagram at red-eyed Jedi girls. I pop into the neighborhood every once in a while just hang out with everybody

[14:22.930 --> 14:29.250]  I wanted my band to be called red-eyed Jedi. That was really a dream of mine. Nobody else agreed. I should have done it
[14:29.250 --> 14:34.050]  Anyway, let's keep it moving. I've got a good friend here that I've met in the neighborhood. It's been a longtime supporter

[17:39.450 --> 17:43.530]  Foreigner and I'm a seed nerd. I'm a seed nerd. I'm a seed nerd. I'm a seed nerd
[17:44.370 --> 17:46.370]  You are but I'm also a
[17:46.730 --> 17:52.690]  Cannabis connoisseur, obviously. Yes. Yes. So they're packing up seeds when the same time as me just trying to
[17:54.570 --> 17:56.570]  So
[17:57.250 --> 17:58.650]  I
[17:58.650 --> 18:01.490]  Need vegetable seeds. I'm gonna hit you up. Yeah, you should
[18:02.370 --> 18:05.410]  Go. All right business has happened and I like it

[18:09.210 --> 18:13.010]  I'm still in probation land. All right, the Midwest is a criminalized land
[18:13.930 --> 18:15.930]  Whatever
[18:16.130 --> 18:18.130]  Yeah, film the police that's right
[18:19.250 --> 18:21.250]  Where we got no vegetable seeds, though
[18:22.090 --> 18:29.570]  What's that? Yeah, we got no vegetable seeds. Oh Bella seeds calm. Oh fuck. Yeah. There you go. Good move. Good move duck
[18:29.570 --> 18:31.570]  Thank all right
[18:32.330 --> 18:38.890]  Everybody thank you for being patient with getting through 20 intros. That's amazingly impressive. Nobody talked over anybody. We all got through that
[18:39.410 --> 18:42.850]  Happy 420 welcome to the show. I don't even know where to begin
[18:43.370 --> 18:49.170]  I guess we can do this and we'll start the conversation here. Does anybody know what 420 actually came from?
[18:49.170 --> 18:54.690]  Does everybody in this room have any idea why we celebrate 420 what this is all about or we just smoking because we're smoking
[18:55.650 --> 19:01.330]  In the story students thing. Yeah, okay. All right. I think I know a little bit about it
[19:01.330 --> 19:03.330]  It was some college students in California that we're
[19:04.050 --> 19:05.610]  smoke I
[19:05.610 --> 19:09.930]  Believe it was at 420 after a certain class, right? I could be I think they're getting out of school
[19:09.930 --> 19:13.450]  I got out of school about four and they'd all meet it at a place at a certain statue
[19:13.450 --> 19:15.450]  I believe it was at 420. I
[19:16.450 --> 19:21.010]  Heard it was like some college kids in NorCal fucking like grateful dead kids
[19:21.730 --> 19:25.410]  But pretty sure some of them were dead heads. Yeah, I'm pretty sure a couple of them were dead heads
[19:25.410 --> 19:28.930]  I was a group they called themselves. The Waldo's is actually what the group was called
[19:28.930 --> 19:30.850]  And so most of the story is basically yeah
[19:30.850 --> 19:35.090]  They would just meet every day at this one spot and smoke at 420 and that's where 420 came from
[19:35.090 --> 19:41.530]  So we owe this holiday this meeting this podcast is all because of a bunch of dorks that wanted to gather after school and smoke
[19:41.530 --> 19:44.610]  Some weed together and they made a time for 20 and it stuck
[19:45.130 --> 19:51.450]  Imagine starting a legend that big or like a piece of folklore, you know, that's a crazy thing. That's like inventing the world
[19:53.450 --> 19:55.450]  To every stoner
[19:55.490 --> 20:01.510]  Imagine the first time they heard that from someone else like oh, hey man, like 420, you know, and then like dude
[20:01.510 --> 20:03.510]  I swear I made that up. Yeah
[20:05.610 --> 20:07.890]  They saying our thing bro, are they doing our thing?
[20:07.890 --> 20:08.210]  Yeah
[20:08.210 --> 20:11.330]  and then they saw stickers of it and shirts and now there's
[20:11.570 --> 20:16.750]  420 pipe cleaner and 420 stores and the mile marker 420 sign gets stolen everywhere
[20:16.750 --> 20:23.010]  We don't have a mile marker 420 in Colorado. We have four nineteen point nine nine because they'll steal the 420 every time
[20:25.290 --> 20:29.370]  Unfortunately, we don't have that among them so we don't even get the
[20:35.090 --> 20:37.090]  I
[20:38.610 --> 20:42.770]  Allegedly I would trade you something for it Mike you tried to say something in your mind. I did not sound loud enough, buddy
[20:53.810 --> 20:57.310]  Red I thank you for joining us for the brief moment. It was great to meet you on camera. Good to see you
[20:57.310 --> 20:59.310]  I look forward to hanging out in the future brother
[21:00.030 --> 21:05.630]  A bunch of stuff I gotta handle so happy for 20 over life bro. Happy for 20 minutes. See you next time
[21:07.270 --> 21:09.270]  Brother
[21:12.470 --> 21:14.990]  Yeah, the Waldo's were high school kids
[21:16.350 --> 21:20.590]  Yeah, San Rafael High School, I believe was the rumored location. I
[21:21.710 --> 21:25.950]  Knew San Rafael was the the place but I didn't know if it was a college or high school Raptor
[21:25.950 --> 21:27.950]  Go ahead. I totally interrupted you. Oh
[21:27.950 --> 21:32.910]  No worries. I actually wanted to hear that too. But yeah, I got some strawberry Starburst
[21:33.790 --> 21:36.290]  Grew, let's see. When was this Harvard?
[21:37.750 --> 21:41.470]  January 21st 2020. So what a way to bring in that year and
[21:42.310 --> 21:43.710]  actually
[21:43.710 --> 21:48.910]  Super delicious. I love it. Just the like a strawberry candy like it's so well
[21:48.910 --> 21:53.830]  I I really enjoy it and I actually um, I don't personally
[21:54.630 --> 21:58.310]  Combust I use a vaporizer happen use a underdog vapes
[21:58.990 --> 22:06.270]  This just lines up with this and my bomb. So yeah, I'm able to enjoy all the flavor like all the flavor
[22:06.270 --> 22:08.270]  It's delicious. I
[22:08.350 --> 22:15.210]  Have been really been enjoying it through the whole year and I've just had like a nice little stash like right there
[22:16.110 --> 22:19.990]  That's the way to do it. Are you self-sufficient? Can you keep yourself supplied? Oh
[22:20.670 --> 22:25.910]  Yeah, like I just said that was from January of last year, yeah, that's pretty impressive
[22:25.910 --> 22:29.190]  I'm doing really not I do not have product from January
[22:29.950 --> 22:31.950]  product from January of this year
[22:38.110 --> 22:39.590]  We got only really
[22:39.590 --> 22:43.470]  Product from January's because I made a point to save it that long-term
[22:43.750 --> 22:48.790]  It's better after a really long cure and storage like that. No, I just didn't want to smoke at all
[22:49.310 --> 22:51.310]  Okay
[22:51.390 --> 22:58.470]  Gotta be conservative. He doesn't have a very large grow. That's true. That's true. That little cubicle doesn't put out sequence too many pounds
[22:58.990 --> 23:03.110]  Have you got a report that it's San Rafael High School in Marin County?
[23:03.110 --> 23:06.310]  Which is north of San Francisco on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge
[23:06.310 --> 23:09.550]  That's a lot of details, but that's where 420 came from
[23:12.230 --> 23:14.230]  Because they met by the wall, yeah
[23:14.270 --> 23:19.070]  I read the way high times. Well, no, I remember high times doing a whole story about it
[23:23.430 --> 23:28.070]  You remember where you first heard about 420 or was it in high times or was it somebody in school?
[23:29.790 --> 23:31.790]  High school no doubt
[23:36.430 --> 23:40.830]  The actual the guy that introduced the actual number 420 to me has actually passed away now
[23:40.830 --> 23:43.910]  So shout out to my buddy James Ritchie. He's no longer with us. He was an amazing artist
[23:44.390 --> 23:47.550]  Really obnoxious outspoken dude an amazing bass player
[23:47.550 --> 23:52.550]  But he was the first one that I ever heard say 420 and I was like what the fuck 420 and in the context
[23:52.550 --> 23:55.690]  It was said I knew what it meant, but I didn't know I didn't know 420 yet
[24:07.190 --> 24:13.450]  That's really cool cultural crosses borders I love it yeah 20 worldwide I'm gonna puff to that one
[24:14.230 --> 24:16.230]  Oh
[24:19.070 --> 24:23.610]  Nobody even noticed a shot at one friend Stoney scholar Stoney gave me this pipe
[24:26.030 --> 24:28.030]  Damn I gotta bust that my pipe
[24:34.150 --> 24:37.350]  Because I have a bowl that matches that and I broke it
[24:38.430 --> 24:42.510]  shortly before he passed away I was gonna get in contact with him because
[24:43.270 --> 24:48.430]  He had the guy make a matching set and I was gonna have it repaired and I don't even know how to contact that dude
[24:48.430 --> 24:54.390]  Oh, man, well that person's watching contact myself or stabby so we could get that pipe repaired because they could be watching you never know
[25:00.230 --> 25:02.030]  Yeah, somebody else can fix it
[25:02.030 --> 25:04.310]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna throw it away ever
[25:04.310 --> 25:08.510]  I'll find someone eventually but I was just hoping to have the original artist do it
[25:08.870 --> 25:13.670]  We're gonna have to get sequence some new lungs over there for 420, but my whole body is sweating
[25:16.190 --> 25:18.310]  This is the second time I've done that but
[25:20.110 --> 25:22.990]  That was a that was watching that that was huge
[25:24.990 --> 25:29.890]  Degrees because I figured it was really big it cool it off did not work. No
[25:32.510 --> 25:36.830]  We're awesome impressive rip bro next time I'll try to put you up on the big screen if I remember before I see it coming
[25:37.790 --> 25:43.870]  But yeah speaking of dad presses I recently got a low temp setup and man how I love it I'm in love I
[25:44.950 --> 25:48.710]  May have to try some more rossin because all my friends are making Ross it's question all day
[25:48.710 --> 25:51.070]  And I'm just not a fan of most of what I smoke when it comes to rossin
[25:51.070 --> 25:55.030]  But just have to figure figure out how to do that correctly. That looks good
[25:56.670 --> 26:00.630]  You know, I have it is sequence I have not as soon as Dan tells us over what he's smoking
[26:00.630 --> 26:06.150]  We're gonna talk about that because that thing's interesting pink lemonade and roja from apothecary farms. I recognize those ladies
[26:06.830 --> 26:08.670]  Yes, sir
[26:08.670 --> 26:14.030]  I'm not even gonna ask how why when and where cuz I know where you are my friend. That's magical and proud of you
[26:14.030 --> 26:16.390]  All right, let's focus. Oh look cuz that's some crack over there
[26:17.510 --> 26:23.470]  It's a good clear looking concentrates, bro. Thank you. This is a some Durban poison live resin. Nice very
[26:23.990 --> 26:25.750]  It's delicious
[26:25.750 --> 26:30.790]  Still magically delicious. All right sequence. Let's talk about that little uh little thermometer thing. You've got over there
[26:30.790 --> 26:35.070]  I've seen a lot of people with that. I'm gonna put you up here on the main screen. What happened? Oh, we got cuz up
[26:35.590 --> 26:37.910]  There we go the turpometer we go
[26:38.590 --> 26:41.630]  They're like a hundred bucks and it tells the temperature
[26:42.350 --> 26:44.350]  using a thermocoupler
[26:44.350 --> 26:48.430]  And mold it for the camera and it's really really probably the best way
[26:49.110 --> 26:54.550]  to tell the temperature for a banger you can't use it for like a slurper, but
[26:55.470 --> 26:56.790]  phenomenal, right
[26:56.790 --> 27:01.490]  So basically heat up your banger stick it right on in there and wait till he gets the temperature that you're comfortable with and then
[27:01.970 --> 27:08.290]  Yeah, it'll rise I'll sell it like settles and then once it starts dropping in temp, you know, yeah, yeah, that's cool
[27:08.290 --> 27:12.310]  I had a steady temp. So I try to dab anywhere between four and five hundred usually
[27:12.890 --> 27:14.090]  All right
[27:14.090 --> 27:16.090]  This thing may dreams to read
[27:16.890 --> 27:20.970]  Degrees off of an IR thermometer and it's the same temperature the whole dab
[27:21.370 --> 27:25.410]  Yeah, an email is really nice and you can use this to calibrate your email as well
[27:25.410 --> 27:27.850]  Oh, that's pretty sweet at that at my buddy's house
[27:27.850 --> 27:33.090]  So we could put it on the email and adjusted the email according to the great idea. Yeah, that's awesome
[27:33.330 --> 27:36.530]  They're like an email but for some reason I it just doesn't
[27:37.090 --> 27:40.810]  It's not hot enough to I've got a heat up my banger any way to clean it or something
[27:40.810 --> 27:43.330]  It just doesn't it's not a fish. I love having it around. It'd be good right now
[27:43.730 --> 27:46.410]  The fact it's sitting around to hit the email so I didn't have to have the torch going
[27:46.570 --> 27:49.810]  But for the most part I prefer just torching it up and doing it that way
[27:49.810 --> 27:52.630]  But that's a beautiful set up. You got cuz the mothership
[27:53.630 --> 27:58.230]  Yeah, it's another court on the table for a podcaster that's a whole nother thing that's true I
[27:58.830 --> 28:04.590]  See are you many a rig? I've owned an email as well. Many are rigs perish to the the old email cord
[28:04.710 --> 28:08.510]  I've seen a bullet joint right off before. Yeah, I've seen glass. Oh, that's for sure
[28:09.390 --> 28:13.510]  But teach their own that's why they make a lot of different toys and that's my pot heads by him because we love toys and
[28:13.510 --> 28:15.310]  It's a lot of good clean fun
[28:15.310 --> 28:17.430]  Since nobody asked I'm dabbing on Picasso
[28:18.150 --> 28:22.470]  Live batter from Green Dot. It's got me talking to it. It's got me a little heavy-eyed and droopy-eyed
[28:23.070 --> 28:28.070]  Digging this you touch took one fat dab out of this container. It's working pretty good for me working pretty good
[28:28.710 --> 28:33.770]  So this is the 420 episode. We've been talking about what you guys are smoking on. This is the pre 420 episode
[28:33.830 --> 28:38.130]  We're in a weird. I don't even want to say the word a weird pandemic situation still
[28:38.130 --> 28:40.130]  It's kind of ending people are getting medicines and shit
[28:40.190 --> 28:45.570]  But what are we doing for 420s anybody got any fun plans or anything? We going out we'd stand in having a party
[28:46.570 --> 28:48.570]  Lockdown
[28:49.770 --> 28:57.090]  I thought I would have gone to the beach, but like we just got 17 new cases yesterday and then 85 today
[28:57.370 --> 29:00.570]  So we're back into like that kind of semi lockdown
[29:01.130 --> 29:07.890]  No beaches. No, nothing. No gathering more than five that kind of bullshit. So fuck I guess
[29:08.770 --> 29:11.650]  Be around and be online somewhere. Yeah
[29:12.650 --> 29:18.410]  That seems to be the way the future the neighborhood yeah, there's a there's a public neighborhood hangout on discord
[29:18.410 --> 29:23.050]  So you guys if you're asking about the neighborhood ask anybody here in one of these chats through a message and we'll tell you how to
[29:23.050 --> 29:25.050]  Get there. Don't worry
[29:25.330 --> 29:27.330]  So there's some stuff going on here
[29:28.450 --> 29:30.090]  420
[29:30.090 --> 29:31.610]  there's like a
[29:31.610 --> 29:33.810]  Like the Jack Eric up or something like that
[29:35.210 --> 29:39.290]  And there's like some local events like like us personally
[29:39.410 --> 29:40.850]  We have
[29:40.850 --> 29:47.090]  Kind of family barbecue plan that to grow with all the employees and like there are significant others
[29:47.290 --> 29:51.210]  So that's what we'll be doing on the actual 420. So
[29:52.730 --> 29:55.530]  If anybody else is in Oklahoma and Southern, Oklahoma
[29:55.530 --> 30:01.730]  I'll be on Sunday with Afro man and I forget what the other guy is playing with kid Lenin
[30:01.730 --> 30:03.290]  I think it's the other guy
[30:03.290 --> 30:07.130]  And we've got a big cannabis fest going on on Sunday down in Durant at Bubba's
[30:07.410 --> 30:10.330]  Brewhouse and we'll be there with the whole bunch of stuff. Hit me up. Oh
[30:10.850 --> 30:17.010]  Hey, hey Steve. I think I have tickets to the oh, no, I think it's like 421. It's a
[30:17.890 --> 30:25.290]  Rome and WB from the dirty heads it down there at the Bubba's brew house in direct. Yeah, I'll see you there then
[30:25.930 --> 30:31.810]  To go to Durant soon. I think I'll meet up in Durant one time exactly go there soon. I got a thing going on there
[30:34.170 --> 30:36.170]  For that show
[30:38.930 --> 30:41.530]  For everyone that doesn't know bubble book Durant, Oklahoma
[30:41.530 --> 30:46.210]  Which is the middle of nowhere actually kind of the Texas Oklahoma border has the largest
[30:46.330 --> 30:50.330]  Currently the largest cannabis friendly venue and all of the United States as far as I'm aware
[30:50.330 --> 30:52.330]  They can have over 2,000 people in that venue
[30:53.010 --> 30:56.890]  Read in the entire place and we're going to the owner. So it's a
[30:57.450 --> 31:02.730]  Venue and if you're looking nice place to host the cannabis event, it's a the largest place
[31:02.730 --> 31:06.930]  You can legally do that type of event. Yeah, I guess I know where we're building the commune
[31:15.050 --> 31:17.050]  An airport
[31:20.770 --> 31:25.890]  Like Oklahoma City, I think it's two hours north and I think Dallas is like an hour south
[31:25.930 --> 31:33.290]  So like pick your airport. I would suggest Dallas personally. You gotta fly somewhere and get a rental car, but it's cheaper. Yeah
[31:38.970 --> 31:40.890]  Guys I hate to interrupt the show
[31:40.890 --> 31:43.190]  But we got another member joining us
[31:43.370 --> 31:47.690]  Jumping in from I'll let him tell us where he's coming in from a good friend Bob on the job has jumped in
[31:47.690 --> 31:49.190]  It looks like his internet's a little bit choppy
[31:49.190 --> 31:53.450]  So if he cuts out I do apologize he's coming from an island but Rasta Bob welcome to the show
[31:53.850 --> 31:57.030]  We have been asking people to tell us where they're coming in from and their
[31:57.090 --> 31:59.170]  Social media handle if you want to share that with us
[31:59.170 --> 32:01.770]  So the mic is all yours if you want to talk for a moment Bob
[32:02.690 --> 32:06.090]  He's hitting a chalice and he's muted. Oh, yeah, Bob. What's up, dude?
[32:07.370 --> 32:12.850]  We'll give him a minute. You gotta get that minute. Yeah Jamaican moment. Yeah
[32:15.010 --> 32:17.010]  We'll let him talk whenever he pops in I
[32:17.970 --> 32:23.590]  Wouldn't that's a little unstable sometimes I think yeah, he's here. We know he's here. He'll give us a Rasta salute greetings
[32:23.810 --> 32:25.810]  Need some starlink down there
[32:27.810 --> 32:29.810]  Yeah
[32:30.810 --> 32:32.810]  Big respect
[32:34.090 --> 32:36.090]  There he is Rasta far I
[32:40.160 --> 32:45.160]  Looks like somebody's telling Tyler's will be goodbye. I might have to get out of here. You got here brother. Yeah, I got water
[32:45.680 --> 32:47.680]  Go get water
[32:47.680 --> 32:49.680]  Shout out to all the Canadian
[32:54.000 --> 32:58.560]  All right, I'm gonna take a dab I'm gonna heat up this dab now my torch is overwhelming through these earbuds
[32:58.560 --> 33:01.600]  So I'm gonna have to start some kind of conversation so you guys could talk while I smoke
[33:01.600 --> 33:06.680]  Yeah, because I got an idea that I had actually just like yesterday. It's all yours, buddy. I'm muting my mic
[33:06.680 --> 33:11.700]  Let's hear it. So I was thinking about starting a little you know, I'm everyone's doing podcast, right?
[33:11.700 --> 33:16.400]  but I thought what if we use the discord for a source for content and
[33:16.920 --> 33:23.080]  We've got a channel on there already called the hotbox we could just do like the hotbox live and it would just be a
[33:23.360 --> 33:27.360]  Disc, you know, it's a I think it's a limit of four people in that chat room
[33:27.400 --> 33:33.200]  So you just do like a powwow chat go live and just broadcast it to the Internet. I
[33:34.600 --> 33:40.000]  Mean we talked about all sorts of stuff on the discord from I was ranting out and raving about
[33:41.960 --> 33:44.840]  Molten salt thorium reactors the other day
[33:45.520 --> 33:51.720]  But we talked about growing and we help people identify past problems and all sorts of cool stuff on there
[33:51.720 --> 33:53.720]  It's a real cool community
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.500]  Sounds fun. If I'm gonna do more live stuff
[33:56.500 --> 34:02.920]  I'm gonna do something that goes up on YouTube and patreon is my next idea because I owe my patrons something and I can't figure
[34:02.920 --> 34:04.920]  Out what to give them. I don't want to give them merch
[34:06.240 --> 34:10.400]  Or two locals at all. No, it sounds like a dating app or something. I know it does it
[34:10.400 --> 34:13.040]  I I don't like the name of it, but it's like a new
[34:13.560 --> 34:16.040]  Type of patreon and there's a lot of
[34:16.720 --> 34:21.360]  Dancing it like just a new new type of platform like that. Yes, we can
[34:27.320 --> 34:34.160]  There's a lot of new stuff coming up like that with like the brave browser and earning crypto from like people just viewing your
[34:34.280 --> 34:36.640]  Your post and stuff like that
[34:37.640 --> 34:38.200]  I
[34:38.200 --> 34:40.440]  Need to clone myself if I want to do that
[34:41.080 --> 34:46.640]  That's why I feel like I need to do something just for patreon because the patreon's contribute and they don't really get anything extra
[34:46.640 --> 34:49.140]  They get a shout out. They get a high-five. I don't want to be
[34:49.720 --> 34:52.200]  Committed to giving them merchandise every month because that's more merch
[34:52.200 --> 34:54.200]  I have to come up with and print ship and deliver
[34:54.360 --> 34:57.760]  So I feel like if I just did like a live show or something for the patrons, that'd be really cool
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.800]  Yeah, it's usually the yeah the way to go with that kind of stuff
[35:02.560 --> 35:04.560]  From that dad to or was it just me?
[35:04.880 --> 35:06.880]  Oh god
[35:06.880 --> 35:10.520]  800 dab sweats. Yes, I'm they recovered for mine. Oh
[35:11.720 --> 35:13.880]  I'm glad you guys are here to carry the show for a moment
[35:14.880 --> 35:16.880]  That's what engage
[35:16.920 --> 35:18.920]  It's way easier with 20 people
[35:19.080 --> 35:22.280]  Isn't it so much fun like usually it's you and I trying to figure out how to fill 30 minutes
[35:22.520 --> 35:26.200]  Yeah, when you're like, I'm gonna hit this fill every time my brain goes blank
[35:27.360 --> 35:30.500]  You can count on stabby to talk who knows what he's gonna say, but you can always count on him
[35:30.580 --> 35:34.660]  Yeah, you never know what's exactly I'm a gorilla full of snakes
[35:36.620 --> 35:39.260]  All right, I'm gonna try to find an image of that to put on the screen
[35:42.180 --> 35:48.100]  With snake looking at bongs of some Leonardo actually by all himself
[35:48.660 --> 35:51.020]  It's delicious blueberries
[35:52.460 --> 35:54.460]  blueberry
[35:54.500 --> 36:00.260]  Some funky notes in there so good. So good. Those are all the right words. What's the plant behind you in your picture, bro?
[36:01.100 --> 36:03.100]  that is
[36:04.420 --> 36:10.020]  Think that's a plant called rascals cool. It's like a
[36:13.060 --> 36:18.940]  Some sort of Macross. All right, but pretty plant. It's a pretty color pretty nice actually. Yeah
[36:19.620 --> 36:21.620]  Got that perpetrator
[36:21.620 --> 36:22.620]  Yeah
[36:22.620 --> 36:27.140]  Grains, I pulled out some of the I said I was keeping some of mine around from January
[36:27.140 --> 36:29.340]  I pulled out some of the Raphael that I grew
[36:30.100 --> 36:36.060]  Back over the winter and this will pull some out of the jar. Absolutely. I might have it focus a lot
[36:36.980 --> 36:38.700]  but yeah, so I
[36:38.700 --> 36:44.220]  Kept a small jar of this around cuz like I love the flavor so much and you know, like stabby said earlier
[36:44.220 --> 36:45.380]  I don't have a huge grow
[36:45.380 --> 36:49.540]  So like when I pull something down I like to try and keep at least one small jar of it
[36:49.540 --> 36:54.740]  Just kind of stashed away for like special occasions and today I feel like you know, it's a pretty special occasion
[36:56.060 --> 36:58.060]  but the raffle
[36:59.860 --> 37:01.340]  Oh
[37:01.340 --> 37:03.100]  Dan yeah
[37:03.100 --> 37:06.580]  I've gotten so many compliments off of people that have smoked it
[37:06.580 --> 37:12.500]  they said, you know, it's everything from like strawberry candy to like blueberry shisha and
[37:13.100 --> 37:16.460]  You know just the the flavor profile on it. It's very complex
[37:17.300 --> 37:25.820]  Nobody can really a hundred percent nail down what it is. Yeah, she's she's absolutely frosty and it's I've had her
[37:26.300 --> 37:29.100]  Probably for like close to three years now that I've kept her around
[37:30.340 --> 37:35.500]  It was not even gonna lie. It was like a one-pop wonder like I still have
[37:35.900 --> 37:42.420]  Most of the seeds left from the the femme pack that I bought, you know, it was just a one seed wonder
[37:42.420 --> 37:47.220]  So there could be something even better in there that I don't even know about yet
[37:47.700 --> 37:48.980]  You've already got a champion
[37:48.980 --> 37:53.460]  I love that you say there's a flavor a thing in there that you can't describe because I always say it's got something like a
[37:53.500 --> 37:55.500]  Funk or a wang or just a
[37:57.180 --> 38:03.500]  Nose curling goodness. There is this something that everybody just they just can't nail it down what it is
[38:03.500 --> 38:09.100]  But it they're like one person says it's grape one person says it's cough syrup
[38:09.100 --> 38:16.620]  One person says it's strawberry candy. One person says it's blueberry like it it changes flavor profiles as different people
[38:17.180 --> 38:20.460]  Like get to yeah. Yeah, I was at a sneaker shop group
[38:21.460 --> 38:22.260]  I
[38:22.260 --> 38:27.300]  Know right. I was at a sneaker shop and somebody opened a Red Bull and I thought oh, that's the blueberry cookies
[38:27.300 --> 38:29.860]  I've never smelled anything that had that same
[38:30.180 --> 38:34.880]  That made me that familiar when it's got a little bit of a Red Bull sort of all the blueberry cookies crosses
[38:34.940 --> 38:37.780]  Have that like how Red Bull is almost gross from far away
[38:37.780 --> 38:39.740]  But as you get closer, it turns into berries
[38:39.740 --> 38:44.020]  It had like an energy drink to it and it definitely made me think about blueberry cookies
[38:44.020 --> 38:46.020]  It was just a media similar to that
[38:50.460 --> 38:54.180]  Podcasting you use that term weighing yeah
[39:00.540 --> 39:02.540]  But
[39:02.740 --> 39:09.020]  He asked me what what is weighing mean like what is weighing taste like and I wanted to avoid like
[39:10.940 --> 39:12.940]  Yeah
[39:21.460 --> 39:25.100]  All of the websites because it can't say weighing now no no
[39:26.340 --> 39:28.340]  like some kind of way
[39:29.340 --> 39:31.340]  Maybe Tang is the word
[39:33.900 --> 39:36.780]  Like a weird tanginess, yeah
[39:41.460 --> 39:43.460]  The old
[39:45.340 --> 39:48.360]  Is that burn that was burn shout out the burn I hope she can hear this
[39:48.360 --> 39:50.000]  I was a you know
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.920]  I got to test the the blueberry butcher and I was trying to like
[39:55.120 --> 40:01.580]  Pinpoint the berry smells that I was getting off of it and it kept changing throughout the grow right like early on
[40:01.580 --> 40:06.840]  I swear I was getting like some some like sour cherry smells or something like that, but I think
[40:08.240 --> 40:14.540]  It was like an elderberry or something and that's not a note that I'm really terribly familiar with you know what I mean?
[40:15.040 --> 40:17.040]  But there's definitely something
[40:18.040 --> 40:20.040]  Different
[40:20.560 --> 40:27.040]  About it not like a fermented because I've had plants before they had like that fermented berries or almost like a wine
[40:28.160 --> 40:30.440]  Terpene to it when when it was finished curing
[40:31.320 --> 40:34.840]  But this was like a like a fresh berry smell to it
[40:34.840 --> 40:40.520]  And then I had a recent on a recent show I said elderberries to oh nice a squatty Fino, huh?
[40:40.520 --> 40:43.260]  yeah, the squatty was a like a
[40:44.260 --> 40:49.100]  Lemon lime citrus soda did have a hint of urinal cakes
[40:51.380 --> 40:57.060]  I'd have to check it to see how I mean, it's it's all dry now. I don't know your no cakes taste like
[40:59.060 --> 41:01.060]  Years I'd claim a piss or a lot so
[41:01.540 --> 41:07.580]  The different colors different are they the same most of them smell like like spearmint bubble with spearmint gum or something, you know
[41:07.580 --> 41:10.060]  I'm like gummy stuff. It's a metal lemon smell
[41:10.540 --> 41:14.820]  Yeah, I had a lot of berry Fino's in the ones that I had but I also had a lot of those
[41:15.860 --> 41:17.060]  world
[41:17.060 --> 41:22.380]  Filotaxi or whatever whatever it's called the the triple nodes or the triple. Yeah each nodes
[41:22.380 --> 41:25.980]  Ah, which number was that two or four that does that one of those does that more than the other?
[41:25.980 --> 41:28.340]  I think it's number two that does that more than the other I?
[41:28.980 --> 41:33.060]  Don't know why I kept a mail of it and you uh you donated to my breeding project. So
[41:35.100 --> 41:37.500]  Already breeding with my unreleased gear I love it
[41:37.780 --> 41:40.220]  Already breeding with my unreleased gear. I love it
[41:41.420 --> 41:43.420]  Hey, hey, I messaged you
[41:46.140 --> 41:50.220]  You might be too high to remember but I got your blessing ahead of time Dave just held up some nuggets
[41:50.220 --> 41:54.420]  What are you showing off there Dave? This is that blueberry butcher you're talking about. Yeah
[41:55.140 --> 41:57.140]  There we go
[41:57.980 --> 42:02.820]  I'll take a quarter. You really killed that girl Dave. Yeah, let me put you up on that
[42:02.820 --> 42:06.580]  Thank you, or however, I do it. Let me pin you here and see if I can make it happen. There we go
[42:07.900 --> 42:10.180]  I hope he came up on your guys's screen. He came up on mine
[42:11.900 --> 42:16.300]  Kind of phallic like bro, how come everything you're involved in is a little dick like
[42:19.860 --> 42:24.060]  What do you want me to tell you man he really puts his passion into it
[42:25.340 --> 42:28.540]  It shows you really definitely put your heart into it
[42:29.780 --> 42:31.780]  speaking of
[42:32.780 --> 42:38.700]  Anybody else got any herbs to show off I've got some uh a little bit of it's dry and crunchy now
[42:38.700 --> 42:42.420]  I've had it for a minute, but I keep going back for this because they're killing it. This is double dose
[42:42.420 --> 42:48.260]  I bred this and it was grown by oh man. I know the grower. It's a commercial grow
[42:48.260 --> 42:52.580]  Mike knows the name of them too. They're the one the grow that has the DJ and their grow all the time
[42:53.980 --> 42:57.740]  Indico Indico, Colorado in the grass double dose and
[42:58.260 --> 43:00.900]  They sell it at a dispensary near me for a reasonable price
[43:01.020 --> 43:03.260]  But they don't let you buy more than a quarter at a time
[43:03.260 --> 43:05.860]  So I got to go in there a couple times a week and get a quarter
[43:05.860 --> 43:10.420]  But that's the double dose dried flower. I'm digging it's pretty good. It's got a nice flavor to it
[43:10.420 --> 43:13.060]  It's a little too dry by now. I think they've had the same batch for a while
[43:13.780 --> 43:15.780]  But it's good herb. I like it
[43:17.980 --> 43:19.980]  Nice
[43:21.460 --> 43:25.980]  Pop up some orange got too much shit in the garden right now
[43:26.420 --> 43:34.140]  I've got I got the blueberry butcher clones and I've got blue raspberry truffle. I got a bunch of I read genetics shit in there
[43:34.660 --> 43:36.660]  Perks got some nice looking herb
[43:36.860 --> 43:40.860]  Speaking of clones. I was actually just gifted an irie genetics clone
[43:41.500 --> 43:44.580]  One of my local buddies just gifted me a morning dew clone
[43:45.500 --> 43:47.500]  my bad score
[43:47.980 --> 43:51.380]  Me here. You go. That's a good gift. Well, so that's a good
[43:52.140 --> 43:59.220]  Yeah, yeah really like dude look at this thing like how can you complain when something like that shows up? Oh who's a happy girl
[44:01.620 --> 44:08.700]  That's a happy little girl dude, yeah, and that's a good type I recognize that I can recognize that leaf structure there are
[44:09.300 --> 44:15.820]  It's a three leaves per node if that if that helps any all right, that's uh, that looks really good a trim, too
[44:16.260 --> 44:18.260]  Yeah
[44:18.340 --> 44:20.780]  Yeah, that's the can I D1 leaf
[44:21.700 --> 44:24.420]  Yeah, so I'm excited to play with this one
[44:24.980 --> 44:30.780]  She's gonna be fun and it's nice to look because it's already been hunted out like he grew a couple of them
[44:30.780 --> 44:32.980]  I know it's a girl. I know it's gonna be pretty decent
[44:33.340 --> 44:36.220]  So now I just get to stick it in my soil and see how it does
[44:36.540 --> 44:40.820]  There you go. Learn that girl see how much nitrogen phosphorus potassium LED light
[44:40.820 --> 44:44.060]  She likes and growing out under the LEDs is a whole new curve for me
[44:44.060 --> 44:49.300]  I'm a very experienced grower and I have put some plants through the damn ringer learning these LEDs
[44:49.380 --> 44:51.380]  Looks like Raptor and cuz got some weed to show
[44:54.460 --> 44:56.940]  Nuggets I was just showing a strawberry
[45:02.020 --> 45:04.200]  Quarantine Bob something remix
[45:08.060 --> 45:12.260]  Bob we love you. Can't hear you brethren. John brought up a really good point
[45:13.380 --> 45:17.540]  What do you say? He was saying I think quarantine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[45:19.460 --> 45:22.020]  Didn't even hear you guys say it again the plane in quarantine
[45:23.980 --> 45:25.980]  Yeah
[45:27.180 --> 45:28.620]  Yes
[45:28.620 --> 45:30.620]  Too weak question
[45:30.620 --> 45:35.100]  So we're going into the outdoor season here soon. So
[45:36.060 --> 45:37.660]  What do you think?
[45:37.660 --> 45:43.060]  Jeff and everyone else. What are the best strains from my region edX to grow outdoor?
[45:43.060 --> 45:47.660]  Do you want to grow some and especially question Q strains that would be you know?
[45:48.540 --> 45:55.540]  Really resistant to bud mold or bud rot maybe somehow don't attract moths cuz moths
[45:58.620 --> 46:03.540]  That's just gave me a really so the strain of is gonna say to answer your question before I do it
[46:03.540 --> 46:06.940]  I want to welcome our friend double door dank to the room double door dank just popped in
[46:06.940 --> 46:10.620]  It looks like he's frozen for the time being but he's here. So I want to acknowledge him and show some love
[46:11.220 --> 46:16.060]  Ross to Bob we know you're here, but your mind keeps coming out too. So love much love enough respect
[46:16.100 --> 46:19.420]  You guys chime in whenever you can but for outdoor for I read genetics
[46:19.420 --> 46:22.460]  I would definitely recommend the morning dew in almost all locations
[46:22.780 --> 46:27.960]  The morning dew I say it's funny because it smells like mothballs and you just said what's gonna get the moths away
[46:28.220 --> 46:31.260]  Maybe that's got something to do with why the bugs don't get to it, but it doesn't get mold
[46:31.260 --> 46:36.220]  It doesn't get mildew. It grows really well outdoor. So that morning dew is killer for the outdoor environment
[46:36.220 --> 46:39.980]  If you've got a longer flowering season, the Sun kiss will do really well for you
[46:39.980 --> 46:43.020]  Our buddy double door has got a sunkissed phenotype in California
[46:43.020 --> 46:47.340]  It finishes in like 55 60 days that just crushes it fills up the greenhouse
[46:47.620 --> 46:50.780]  They're paying the fucking bills off that sunkissed. He threw up a thumbs up in the chat
[46:50.780 --> 46:53.660]  I don't know if you guys can see that but he put up a thumbs up in response to that
[46:53.900 --> 46:57.700]  That sunkissed is killing it out there in California. I get pictures and reports of people from that
[46:57.700 --> 47:03.980]  So the morning do the Sun kiss and then probably the orange gasm if you have a longer longer flowering season
[47:04.220 --> 47:06.220]  like alternate Caribbean like
[47:07.260 --> 47:10.340]  Yeah, you guys would kill with the orange gasm that would kill it out there
[47:10.340 --> 47:16.260]  That was about that. Yeah, it was about that. But if you if you ran any of your stuff out here, I like what?
[47:21.100 --> 47:24.780]  Yeah, what's up Jeff what's up, what's up man? It's good to see you bro
[47:26.820 --> 47:28.420]  Fucking hell man
[47:28.420 --> 47:34.660]  My time is yeah, I haven't seen Steve since fucking a little expo or the dab concentrate event where he was that
[47:35.020 --> 47:38.260]  We're all getting fucking, you know dab down. I was a fun time
[47:38.820 --> 47:40.260]  Probably the
[47:40.260 --> 47:43.180]  Was the last time we all got to hang out together, man. Yeah
[47:48.700 --> 47:53.940]  Podcast I've been listening quite a bit to that. I gotta say man. I'm really impressed with all that
[47:54.460 --> 47:58.220]  Information, you know, I passed that on to many people
[47:59.380 --> 48:04.720]  I'm pretty pretty excited man. I've been promoting you got your podcast like a motherfucker, dude
[48:04.980 --> 48:06.980]  There's a lot of people who wanna
[48:07.940 --> 48:12.260]  Use natural, you know fish microbials to
[48:13.060 --> 48:15.780]  Power the farm, so I'm pretty excited man
[48:16.500 --> 48:17.380]  That's awesome
[48:17.380 --> 48:21.500]  I'm gonna turn off your camera because it was I turned off your camera cuz your Wi-Fi was killing you but you sound much better
[48:21.500 --> 48:24.420]  Now that I see you you've got a face for radio anyway, brother. I
[48:25.820 --> 48:27.820]  Want a double down?
[48:28.220 --> 48:34.860]  Hopefully Steven you guys hear me right now. Yeah, we can I want to double down on what he said about watching Steve's content
[48:34.860 --> 48:40.140]  Because even if you're not gonna grow fishes, you'll definitely learn something watching Steve's content
[48:40.140 --> 48:46.980]  I mean, I've I've even adopted the whole dual root zone thing now, like I've got my pots and trays full of hydroton
[48:49.060 --> 48:53.240]  The dude knows a lot he's very well educated never never misjudge a dread
[48:53.240 --> 48:57.320]  I love it when I walk in with the dreads and people think I'm not gonna know shit and then I reschool them on their
[48:57.320 --> 49:01.540]  Entire fucking grow. It's the funnest thing to do so you can learn a lot from my brother Steve
[49:01.540 --> 49:03.300]  I
[49:03.300 --> 49:08.220]  Appreciate it guys. Sorry about the dog there for a second, but yeah, I appreciate that's family to brother dog is family
[49:08.220 --> 49:10.220]  Dogs on the show now the dogs famous
[49:10.620 --> 49:16.500]  But Steve's probably gotten Steve's probably got some of the highest level of you know, I'm in this role the humidity
[49:17.260 --> 49:21.460]  you know, how do you deal with the moisture the amount of fucking moisture that you deal with the
[49:22.180 --> 49:27.300]  Humidities that keep that going that you know, you're constantly running fluid through, you know
[49:27.300 --> 49:30.300]  How do you guys deal with that, you know on an aquaponics level?
[49:31.540 --> 49:34.380]  Yeah, I've moved it on the house with just a fish tank. So that's a pretty good question
[49:35.340 --> 49:40.000]  Ross to Bob said anything to the platinum tangy the orange gasm or sun kiss is great outdoors
[49:40.620 --> 49:45.300]  Ross to Bob also made a good point. He said Prada is another one that could take it great outdoors
[49:45.620 --> 49:52.380]  That's absolutely absolutely true. Prada finishes early. It's got blueberry and flow and a rise in it. So it's potent. It's vigorous
[49:52.900 --> 49:56.580]  But it's very limited in quantity on seeds. I'm not sure where you'll be able to find it
[49:56.580 --> 50:01.320]  I've got a couple of packs left. So good luck finding the Prada, but that one kills it outdoors definitely crushes
[50:02.380 --> 50:04.660]  Yeah, so with the with the humidity
[50:04.660 --> 50:08.540]  It generally makes it pretty easy to maintain BPD in a place like Colorado where it's so dry
[50:08.820 --> 50:10.820]  But definitely can be an issue
[50:11.340 --> 50:16.860]  At nighttime mainly so we do you know definitely have to make sure we have dehumidifiers or a good airflow at nighttime
[50:16.860 --> 50:21.960]  But that's facing plus is proper pruning and making sure you have you know cultivars that are adapted to it and finally so phenos
[50:22.420 --> 50:26.280]  In your cultivars that you're looking for that are a little bit, you know more more humid tolerant
[50:26.420 --> 50:31.140]  You know trying to stick to more equatorial strain similarly growing and even in Oklahoma is similar to right?
[50:31.140 --> 50:34.500]  You have higher humidity or Texas or anywhere on the Gulf Coast?
[50:34.500 --> 50:39.540]  You're gonna have higher humidity and you know, or Jamaica you guys are done in Jamaica and Trinity
[50:40.020 --> 50:43.420]  You guys are very similar growth lines in terms of humidity. It was me. So
[50:44.180 --> 50:46.860]  We'll see like I'm in Santa Cruz man. I'm right on the coast
[50:46.860 --> 50:49.260]  literally we get a lot of ocean winds and a lot of
[50:49.620 --> 50:53.220]  You know a lot of that fog coming off the ocean at nights and stuff
[50:53.220 --> 50:56.180]  We get you know tremendous amounts of humidity spice at night
[50:56.180 --> 50:59.700]  And so there's a lot of people here trying to do the aquaponics thing at the same time
[51:00.300 --> 51:05.420]  You know any advice for people, you know growing greenhouse that are trying to do this, you know
[51:05.420 --> 51:09.540]  You know symbiotic in a kind of higher humidity environment other than you know
[51:09.540 --> 51:14.300]  I I know dehumidification is probably key to everything but you know, you know
[51:14.540 --> 51:18.820]  Just some simple advice to some of the people in the higher humidity environments
[51:19.380 --> 51:25.580]  The other big thing I would say is going to be ultra critical and high humidity environments is relying heavily on geothermal
[51:25.780 --> 51:29.980]  Over wet walls because geothermal will operate just fine in high humidity environments
[51:30.020 --> 51:33.540]  Whereas wet walls are horribly inefficient and in humidity humid environment
[51:33.540 --> 51:39.780]  So, you know if you have cooler ground or even even better if you have a cool aquifer and you can pull like in Jamaica
[51:39.780 --> 51:42.980]  For example underground it's still 70 72 degrees, right?
[51:42.980 --> 51:45.260]  It's not that much cooler because it's the tropics
[51:45.260 --> 51:47.940]  But if you find an aquifer that aquifer is much cooler
[51:48.020 --> 51:53.700]  so if you can pull water up from underground and circulate that through either a heat exchanger attached to a wet wall to
[51:53.780 --> 51:59.580]  Basically chill that wet wall or to have it attached directly to the slab or through a heat exchanger in your drill beds
[52:00.500 --> 52:02.140]  For yourself, you can actually you know
[52:02.140 --> 52:07.300]  Do it that way to cool everything down and be very efficient even in a very humid place like the Caribbean
[52:07.740 --> 52:10.940]  Hell, yeah, dude. Well, one of the things that I ran into majorly
[52:11.820 --> 52:15.900]  Aw shit my bad. I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to over talk to you. Yeah, but you're good, bro
[52:15.900 --> 52:20.380]  I'm gonna interrupt both you guys though. I'm gonna interrupt everybody so we can welcome. Mr. Bag seed to the show
[52:20.380 --> 52:22.380]  What I'm mr. Bag see a mr. Bag seed
[52:22.380 --> 52:24.380]  Cheers
[52:29.620 --> 52:31.620]  What's up everybody
[52:34.140 --> 52:36.140]  Yeah, it turns you off what chops up your
[52:37.020 --> 52:42.020]  Video again. I got a good Wi-Fi now. There you go. I should be ready to go. Yeah, there we go
[52:42.020 --> 52:45.460]  There we go. Oh, there he is. There's that sexy face coming from Cali, bro
[52:47.460 --> 52:49.460]  We're in the dojo right now
[52:50.460 --> 52:54.620]  So you're coming in from Santa Cruz, how can we follow you on social media Matt just get people your social media real quick
[52:54.620 --> 52:56.620]  I've been letting people plug their social media when they come in
[52:56.900 --> 53:01.780]  Yeah, friendly fire farms friendly fire farms is what I've got going on right now
[53:01.780 --> 53:09.260]  I've got outdoor greenhouse and indoor running right now. I've got three different sections. We're running each pretty successfully
[53:09.860 --> 53:12.140]  Out here as well as I've got people in North
[53:12.820 --> 53:15.180]  California I want to say Colorado so funny
[53:15.180 --> 53:17.300]  I live in Colorado for so long can't stop saying it
[53:17.300 --> 53:21.060]  But uh, I got people up in North California above Sacramento
[53:21.060 --> 53:26.220]  I'll surroundings a lot of Jeff's stuff and as well as a lot of some of my stuff, so I'm pretty proud right now
[53:26.700 --> 53:33.340]  One of the biggest things Steve man. I'll tell you what there's been more questions about aquaponics down here than you can imagine
[53:33.860 --> 53:37.620]  And I've had to answer so much shit and I just keep saying grow with fishes
[53:37.660 --> 53:42.100]  You need to check out the podcast because like if you really want to know how to do this
[53:42.100 --> 53:46.540]  This is how you're gonna do it because symbiotic aquaponics is not something you just walk into it
[53:46.860 --> 53:50.820]  It's definitely a process that I think people need to understand the amount of bacteria
[53:50.820 --> 53:54.540]  You need to build up the amount of you know, like to properly
[53:56.060 --> 53:59.460]  And that's kind of grown for like 12 years 20 years 40 years
[53:59.460 --> 54:02.980]  I don't even know and aquaponics is like a completely different thing to me
[54:02.980 --> 54:07.900]  I don't know the first step about aquaponics like I would be if you're like setting up an aquaponics girl
[54:07.900 --> 54:10.660]  I go. Well, here's Steve's card. That's how I would set up
[54:11.260 --> 54:13.260]  You
[54:13.580 --> 54:15.580]  Can talk to mr. Bagsy real quick
[54:15.780 --> 54:20.660]  We're gonna talk to back see what's up, mr. Bagsy look sexy as fuck. He's got a fresh haircut. He's back from Colorado
[54:20.660 --> 54:24.780]  He's got that giant bong in his lap. He's also muted so we can't hear a damn. Yeah, I'm saying
[54:28.900 --> 54:31.780]  Make noise it's a podcast bro when people have been coming in
[54:31.780 --> 54:36.980]  I've been been being polite letting us letting them tell us where they're coming from and how we can find them on social media
[54:36.980 --> 54:40.020]  So we get you some social media followers. Yeah, man. I'm from Missouri
[54:40.020 --> 54:43.220]  I live in Missouri right now. I'm a more enthusiastic about
[54:44.220 --> 54:46.700]  Dude, I kind of had something to drink. Yeah, I'm probably a little slow
[54:51.780 --> 54:57.360]  Yeah, I'm in Missouri, yeah hanging out we hang out in the neighborhood all the time I know you come through we have the new
[54:57.740 --> 55:01.060]  YouTube channel the neighborhood grows that we're starting. Yeah
[55:03.420 --> 55:07.100]  Everybody's been mentioning it I guess now is a good time since we got I in my opinion
[55:07.100 --> 55:10.660]  You're the fucking like the leader of the hood. You're the mr. Rogers, but we gotta get you a silly sweater
[55:16.380 --> 55:19.940]  Yeah, I mean everyone everyone who comes through yeah, that's the part of the neighborhood
[55:19.940 --> 55:23.380]  We all just kind of hang out and talk and help each other. That's you know, it's really
[55:24.660 --> 55:26.660]  It became I mean, you know
[55:28.620 --> 55:32.180]  But like I basically got all that from you Jeff
[55:32.180 --> 55:35.920]  I mean your whole growing mentality and everything is easy for me to catch on to
[55:36.360 --> 55:41.360]  You know, I watch the Michigan bros and everybody it's really how I found all you guys and it's really you know
[55:41.360 --> 55:43.600]  How everyone comes together? It's really cool
[55:44.200 --> 55:48.120]  Everyone who comes through the hood, you know, I fucking love everybody and everyone I watch
[55:48.120 --> 55:50.120]  I love you guys, too, even though I don't know you but
[55:50.640 --> 55:52.440]  Yeah, I mean that's kind of what we're about
[55:52.440 --> 55:57.440]  We just kind of hang around and talk about everything and then we have good topics to talk about so we want to you know
[55:57.440 --> 56:00.120]  Go live so that's kind of what I can't wait for you
[56:00.120 --> 56:03.600]  So tell us about the going live part. Tell us about this live 420 show that the hoods do
[56:04.560 --> 56:09.960]  We're just yeah, we're all just gonna hang out on the 420 show, but we're gonna start out as a show
[56:09.960 --> 56:11.880]  We're gonna do like beginner grows
[56:11.880 --> 56:17.040]  Helping people, you know at starting out beginner grows and whatnot and then go from there, you know up to what Raptor knows
[56:17.040 --> 56:22.720]  I mean Raptor knows a ton of knowledge GMF everybody that comes into the hood has so much good knowledge
[56:22.720 --> 56:27.360]  So if we can just keep all that going that's kind of what what we're trying to do, you know, go
[56:27.360 --> 56:33.320]  Yeah, I learned a lot for shows have having more shows and more people feed off of ideas is what all this is about
[56:33.600 --> 56:38.640]  So, um, that's that's that's what I'm you know, I don't know everything. I'm a newer grower. I'm a salt grower
[56:38.640 --> 56:44.040]  Um, you know, I I do I love growing I want to learn more and it's cool being around all you guys
[56:44.040 --> 56:46.040]  So that's that's really yeah
[56:46.240 --> 56:50.040]  You learn quickly learn very quickly and your video skills are rad like you're
[56:51.680 --> 56:54.200]  This production is off the chain. Thank you. Yeah
[56:55.120 --> 57:00.560]  I'm pretty excited. Have a great show. Oh somebody dipped out. I'm pretty apologize. We lost somebody I'll smoke to
[57:01.200 --> 57:06.240]  You're not even ready for what's about to happen now you guys I just allowed somebody into this chat and it's gonna break the whole
[57:06.240 --> 57:08.240]  chat
[57:08.240 --> 57:10.240]  I
[57:38.240 --> 57:40.240]  Miss Pearl
[57:53.040 --> 57:55.040]  I've told everybody
[57:56.560 --> 57:59.760]  Where are you coming in from tonight and how do we find you on social media miss painted lady?
[57:59.760 --> 58:03.760]  I am coming in from actually a meeting. I just got out of a meeting and
[58:04.400 --> 58:11.320]  Everybody can find me on instagram at painting lady gardens and cannabis at painted lady 13. I believe I'm over there
[58:14.640 --> 58:19.160]  Michigan bros Gros show Sunday and Monday nights. I knew there were 12 other painted ladies
[58:20.160 --> 58:25.280]  No, 13 is just my number. So I like it. I like 13 pearls in that necklace
[58:25.840 --> 58:28.420]  Well, yeah, don't make me a ho
[58:34.480 --> 58:35.520]  I
[58:35.520 --> 58:42.080]  Had a question for Steve actually I've seen the large-scale aquaponics setups that he's done firsthand
[58:42.320 --> 58:47.480]  What's the smallest you could possibly do? Could you do like a goldfish tank for Dan's setup?
[58:47.880 --> 58:53.200]  Like so we've the smallest I've actually grown anything on aquaponics about two and a half gallon tank
[58:53.200 --> 58:59.000]  I grew forehead the lettuce but as far as cannabis the smallest we were able to get a cannabis plant to grow with
[59:00.000 --> 59:06.120]  I what would normally be considered an appropriate amount of fish and often an aquarium was about 40 gallons
[59:06.680 --> 59:12.960]  Just in terms of it takes so much biomass of fish to create enough biomass of fish manure
[59:16.360 --> 59:19.800]  10 gallon or 20 gallon guppy tank that was just packed to the brim
[59:19.800 --> 59:21.800]  You know
[59:23.720 --> 59:25.720]  Yeah, that'd be kind of unethical
[59:26.080 --> 59:28.240]  Treatment and the guppies even though they are guppies
[59:28.240 --> 59:35.160]  But like I was just curious because like how could your average home grower or hobbyist grower adopt an aquaponic system?
[59:36.440 --> 59:38.440]  Fill in their garage full of fish
[59:43.560 --> 59:47.160]  You get for a saltwater aquarium or drill your tank really into glass
[59:47.600 --> 59:53.080]  But most people just buy an overflow tank run that down to your sub tank and then run a return pump to either
[59:53.600 --> 59:59.240]  Up to your fish tank and then you either run a second pump to your flood and drain table or run that on a bell
[59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.760]  So if your loop siphons, you know, you know everything can run continuing but yeah, it's super simple
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.520]  You know, I mean, it's not a lot of work
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.320]  You've already have a grow tank a grow tray and a sub tank
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:11.200]  It's literally like a trip to the saltwater fish store and you can have that up and running at about half an hour
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.320]  nice
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.320]  So we thought it was way more than that. Oh
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.960]  Yeah
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.280]  That's awesome, man
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:18.800]  Yeah
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:24.440]  I didn't know if you had to develop like quite a bit of culture before they started actually being efficient and you know
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:28.880]  How much you know bacteria you have to develop before that starts becoming, you know, irrelevant
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.480]  Feeding, you know, right?
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.480]  You know this is a fish burger
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.080]  The same way that you would cycle or mature a good living soil bed
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:41.040]  It's the same thing you do with the aquarium or an aquaponics and you just stop populating those microbes
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.680]  Same way we would when we inoculate our gardens in the springtime in our soil bed very similar
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.880]  Okay. Oh, yeah, that's awesome, man. It's good to know
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.640]  Good questions. I like Donja Grover's comments in the chat. All right guys
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.720]  I think we got interrupted when we were talking about what everybody's gonna do for 420
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.280]  We know that Doug's on lockdown after that
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.600]  I think we totally got off the rails and fucking abandoned that whole topic and started talking about aquaponics and
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.400]  Fucking who knows what else I don't remember because I've been smoking as much as you guys
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.800]  That's why I invited you. I knew I would need content
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.840]  I didn't know I would need all the content off the rails
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:15.680]  Oh look who's joining us. Let me allow somebody into the room here before we ask this one
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:21.360]  But everybody think about what you're gonna do for 420 because after I do this intro here, we're gonna talk about that
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:27.080]  He's connecting. He is here. He's live in the chat. He's wearing some death metal shirt today, which you got going
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.920]  Let's welcome to the room
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.440]  Look at this fucking crowd
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.100]  Happy for the barrel of monkeys. I'm so glad everyone made it fashion
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.240]  here black sale
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.480]  Rasta fog smoking down
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.720]  How can people find you on social media Keith
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:57.960]  Black sale market on cannabis, which is a fucking phenomenal app. Every grower should be on their
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:05.520]  Black sale market on Instagram Keith at black sale market calm or just black sale market calm hit me up with your LED questions
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.600]  We're gonna do a full episode with Keith pretty soon this a zoo meeting here
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.280]  It's kind of a practice run to get good at doing zoo meetings with other people
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.400]  So I think I got the hang of it. I was able to manage 22 people
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:19.640]  I think I can do a one-on-one show now with Keith. We'll get a lot of you guys on shows one-on-one now
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.280]  Hey, thank you for joining us, bro. Don't let anybody pick on you for being late
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.320]  I said come one come all come whenever you can so I'm glad people made it
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.720]  Now I'm gonna ask the question that's been pending
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:35.080]  The only person I know what they're doing for 420 is duck because he said fucking lock down because the beaches are closed
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.880]  I hope you get duck. I hope you get somebody on that couch, by the way, just just drop that in there
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.440]  We have some book spaces tomorrow
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.440]  Beautiful
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:53.480]  Keep just popped in do you have any plans for 420 or you stuck in the house because of the the pandy?
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:00.900]  You know, I'll probably end up going over to Nasi's and getting stoned it's pretty much what I do for fun, you know
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.840]  So you're gonna take a dab and then take a nap on the dog bed
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.300]  Yeah, man, pretty much a party. It's a great time for you
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.880]  That was it. How many dads will you take throughout the day like three maybe four?
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:19.840]  Yeah, I take a lot of dabs throughout the day, but I take like tiny little baby dabs, dude
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:27.000]  Like one Pedro dab is like a fucking week's worth all at once and so I get very pale and then I pass out
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.240]  Take do you tell them said you take half of a half dab?
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.960]  It's a micro dab
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.680]  Micro dabbing I hear half-quarter dabs are all the rage in Canada
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.840]  Quarters all around. Oh, you're crazy. Hey
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:52.680]  All right, miss painted lady. I know you're out there on that the other coast. Do you have any plans for the 420?
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.680]  Are you trapped indoors because of the panty?
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:04.720]  When I said, where are you earlier you said you came from I thought you were just dodging your location and leaving that a secret
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.720]  So I was gonna go with
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.880]  The Michigan Bros Gros show so no, I'm in Michigan. I was where in Michigan I am. Okay, you know, but
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:22.140]  Yeah, hey kid rock came from Michigan, that's all I know. Oh man, he picked the worst one
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.360]  One more time and I'm gonna meet your Mike
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.040]  Like don't remind me
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.440]  Yeah, no, we're gonna hang out with the Michigan Bros
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:39.480]  Hell, yeah, we just had an event at sequences housewarming not too long ago. So when was that sequence couple weeks ago, I guess
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.720]  Yeah
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.360]  Because basically our
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:50.160]  Pandemic bubble has been our group. We've done a bunch of events with just our group of people and we smoke and stuff and
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.280]  It's went well
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:57.200]  So we'll probably do something for 420. We haven't played anything yet though. That's normal. We don't ever yeah
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.040]  So it's only five days why start planning now
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:07.920]  We do have a what is that loser an event Bigfoot Lodge where we're gonna do
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.160]  What is it?
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.560]  We're gonna be vending and stuff at an event in
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.720]  Northern Michigan and then camping overnight
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.320]  You've been like different days in July
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.840]  very fun
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:26.720]  Events are happen are gonna come back soon sometime. I'm so excited for events
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:32.240]  I miss events and concerts and just going up to Denver to dab on tenacity's couch would be a good time right now. I
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:37.560]  Will say they had a comedy event at the dispo the other day, which was pretty cool
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:43.240]  They had like five comics they called it from other states and it was just nice to see like live events again
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.640]  Like, you know, I mean it was outdoor
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:50.760]  But it was still nice to see like dispo putting on like barbecues and you know having these fucking fun events again
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:55.600]  You know kind of reminded me of before the whole Kovac thing. It was really nice like people were in truck beds
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.080]  Just watching this it was great. It was a lot of fun. I'm hoping ready
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.600]  I'm so ready for events. I don't know how long it'll be before I go to big big events
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:08.680]  But like small medium events, I'm ready to do it, but it's gonna take a while for people to remember how to act
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.840]  So I'm not ready to go to big big stuff yet, but medium stuff
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:16.840]  I'm in there may be a medium-sized event coming up in May that I'll start advertising here really soon
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.080]  I just got to just send that final agreement
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.080]  I gotta write the check and then I'll start advertising
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:24.040]  There's a thing in Denver though. You guys coming up in may be prepared
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:30.400]  Mike said I was gonna say I think the last time we all hung out together was actually at
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.880]  Frosty McNuggets house not not to Nazis
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.280]  I'm just saying it would be nice just to go sit on tenacity scouts with the dogs and tenacity and Keith would be a fucking
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:46.720]  Party at this point in time the most company I've had in the past few months has been Mike like no offense to Mike
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:50.960]  But we've seen each other dude. I'd like like a couple other people would be cool like, you know
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:56.560]  Oh, yeah, I definitely remember that everybody got got the coveated Frosty McNuggets this house. I do remember we all shared it that night
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.400]  Everybody's not there had like yeah, we all went home and got sick. Oh
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:07.160]  Guys got sick. I think it's a dick donut though. Do you guys remember the dick donut was legendary?
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.440]  That was amazing
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.320]  Anybody that wasn't there is lost now
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.720]  Hey cascadian grow just went live on Instagram if anybody wants to tell them that the parties over here
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.240]  That event you guys described sounds like one of the ones that we would have done here
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.000]  So it's nice to know that those sorts of community communities still exist all over the place
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.040]  So I think we try to foster a lot over here in Michigan
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:36.360]  Now you can't stop the cannabis community. There definitely are a lot of restrictions and loopholes right now, but you can't stop us
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:41.680]  We're a bunch of underground. We like the growers and breeders have always been a bunch of underground rebels. Now. It's just something legal
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.280]  We're still we've still got a rebel mindset. We got a rule breaker mindset
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.760]  We were always that kid in school that fucking was late and stoned and didn't give a shit
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.840]  I don't feel tardy like that was always us
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.960]  Double doors showing off his swords

[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.680]  if you've never seen guys fight with fucking full-on staffs and

[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:35.880]  It's nuts man. If you've never watched guys fucking do weapons training for kung fu. It's fucking awesome

[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.640]  I think Matt eat mushrooms and got creative and told us a story but then you just panned through a really great commercial
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.280]  Bro, if shit goes down, can I come there?
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.880]  Yeah

[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.080]  So
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.480]  When you see these behind
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:42.720]  Yeah, it's like all the weapons from that Chateau fight scene in the Matrix
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.920]  The wristbands
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.560]  Fucking

[01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:03.580]  Horti that is the horticulture company that I started I separated that out from the rest of everything else I got going on
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.900]  So yeah, we can talk about it man. It's that's pretty cool. I'm really excited about it

[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:30.020]  It's been a good time. It's been a learning experience
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:34.660]  I've had to make a prototype or two and alter the designs a little bit. I'm happy with where it is now
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:39.460]  I just have to put the final design together and I'll have prototype videos up and running
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:46.860]  The model itself is very well proven. It's actually open source. So the only thing I'm really selling is not the model
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:53.820]  It's not a secret. It's just my labor and parts. That's that's the only reason for a market is my labor and parts. So
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:58.860]  It's very time-tested design. It's really it's really cool. They use it a lot in
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:03.700]  Bird breeding because they can't yeah, they can't waste the food
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:08.220]  So they have to recover their costs from the seed from the seed from the seed from the seed
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:13.620]  Costs from the seed that the birds eat they have to clean that out of the seed that they just spill
[01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:19.460]  So it's made for all size seeds because they they don't use one in particular seed
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:24.180]  It's always a mix. So it works for all kinds of seeds and should be pretty cool
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.180]  I just got to dial it in a little bit
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:29.780]  It's a good product. I've seen it. I know where the idea came from. I know the idea is solid
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:34.220]  So I hope you have great success with that, but when they're ready, I'm definitely gonna be looking at one
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:35.180]  I've got a seed cleaner now
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:37.880]  But you know, I always put them side by side and clean twice as many seeds
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:41.580]  Appreciate it man. Thanks for letting me have a moment to talk about it. Oh, yeah, man
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:46.060]  I'm gonna support the community here got to support the community you guys if you're up if you're just a regular grower
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.180]  Not just a regular girl. I'm not trying to downplay a grower
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:52.020]  If you're a grower that's got a trim your version of trimming what you guys call trim jail
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:56.460]  Which I find disrespectful to anybody that's been in real jail where you're listening to sublime and eating Cheetos quit saying trim jail
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:02.860]  But you guys that are in trim jail the breeders version is cleaning seeds and packing seeds. That is our version
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:08.340]  32 hours of Netflix and just be prepared and have 12 bottles of water and just go to clean it and packing seeds
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:10.340]  That's our version. So that machine he's making is
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:15.580]  Definitely useful helpful for somebody in our position. So yeah, good work, bro. I need one
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:19.260]  Anybody else here do any breeding or is it just me? I'm looking around to see who we're playing with
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:22.940]  Yeah, I'm looking for some ladies any single ladies. Yeah, you're always
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:26.540]  Today I've been called a breeder before but it was in a different context
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:34.060]  Because your pull-out game is weak I heard perp say that he's doing some pollen dusting what are you doing over there perp?
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:40.380]  Yeah, I just a little pollen on a pretty much everything in my flower right now
[01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:42.580]  today
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:44.580]  I'm just it's um
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:49.460]  Wow, I'm not I'm not a pollinator. I'm not a pollinator. I'm not a pollinator
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:51.620]  That's it's um
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:57.240]  Wow, I'm not gonna spill the beans right now, but I put it on to a bunch of a I re stuff
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:59.240]  So and I'm collecting some
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.620]  What is it
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:04.940]  Blue raspberry truffle pollen as well
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:11.580]  Beautiful. We're gonna was the baby daddy and this breeding run. I read genetics or another breeder. I
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.780]  Was another breeder. Okay, you're cool
[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:19.260]  You're gonna like that's cool because all my shits like if you keep breeding with mine you bottleneck yourself. So that's really great
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:21.260]  Yeah, yeah
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:27.940]  Reaching far out far out. So I like that the further out the better like it. I promise you I will I trust your selections
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:30.660]  I've seen what you do anybody else out there breeding or just just our man perp
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.940]  Wow
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.780]  Go ahead either one of you guys go ahead
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:41.860]  I was just saying I wanted to breed later like I have
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:49.060]  Sts and I have pollen that I've collected and I made one cross that I'm testing now, but I'm no breeder or anything like that
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:55.900]  Yeah, you're doing your breeding. You're making bets breeding. You're gonna tell you otherwise, you know, yeah, you're learning it. I
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:01.100]  Got I'm doing some open pollination right now. I have some really awesome seeds
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:03.100]  I got in Zimbabwe up in the hills
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:08.300]  Some really cool sativas doing some open pollination without to try and batch them out so we can give a bunch of them out
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:10.580]  There's very cool
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:14.040]  You said cool sativas. How long are those flowering?
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:22.240]  That's the million-dollar question. All right. I'm really curious about some Zimbabwe sativa. I'm a guest 12 weeks dog 12 weeks
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.680]  I'm gonna say 16. I'm gonna get some 16. Yeah
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.560]  Yeah, ambitious guys I picked these
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:37.280]  Earlier, I guess they'd be late in the summer early in the fall. There are times who would they actually would be
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.840]  Equivalent to us would kind of be like early September finishers
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.280]  But we'll see I also have no idea what they were planted
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.920]  They I just happen to be in the right place at the right time and and get a you know
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:52.080]  A nice tour of a farm where I was going through and they were mature seeds
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:57.480]  So obviously, you know paper planes found a way to follow. Yeah, I love it
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.240]  I love it big respect for all the work you do moving genetics around
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:03.640]  That's the only way that I need to say that but big respect for it. I appreciate that
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:09.800]  As a seed breeder and somebody trying to move seeds around I know your struggle brother. Definitely. All right, Cass
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:11.920]  I saw you raise your hand and say that you're breeding some seeds
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:15.520]  So cascading I'll give you a chance to talk about your breeding project if you want to go for it now
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:22.280]  Oh, dude, I got a whole ball of wax. I'm just getting ready to crack into I'm going back. I'm going back in time
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.720]  Not really
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:29.500]  I'm going to land race heirloom genetics and getting out of what I call the box, which is
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.440]  camps diesels ogs all that's
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.500]  Yeah, I'm going back to to
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.200]  some land races and mixing
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:43.960]  Particular land races with my environment in mind, so I'm really focused on
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.480]  the
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.480]  Pakistani and
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:52.480]  Afghanis Hindu Kush and mixing that with Himalayan
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.800]  Genetics Nepalese
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:02.960]  Manipuri Burma the really wet stuff so that I can get the yield and the hash from the Hindus
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:08.760]  But the mold resistance and the structure from the Himalayas and really nice and those for my area so
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.680]  many people
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:14.080]  So many people overlook the resistance part. They just want Instagram ability
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:19.600]  So I'm glad you're talking about resistance early on in your breeding instead of I'm gonna find a phenotype that sells weed on Instagram
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.160]  That's what it's all about now
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:21.960]  No, man
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:28.360]  I want to breed for the future for the day with it that the plant is set free and you can put it outside
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.240]  And we need to develop regional cultivars and and regional like
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:39.680]  Genetic families. It doesn't just need to be a single cultivar. It needs to be interrelated families that are regional
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:43.760]  like Appalachian style where they thrive in that environment and
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:49.420]  they might thrive in other environments, but they're cultivated for that environment so that the day that the cuffs come off we
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:55.840]  We can just take our seeds and go outside and just throw them and they go we don't have got mountain Kush
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:01.240]  You've got your Cascadian Kush black sails got his Denver Kush ducks got his Caribbean Kush
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:06.160]  We all just throw our acclimated perfect seeds out there. Yeah, I can't wait for that. That's what I'm breeding
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:09.160]  I'm breeding for that world. I'm always looking 10 steps ahead
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.880]  So I'm breeding for that world not the world we live in right now
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:16.480]  Cuz this is a show to go back to the future. You need that the DeLorean it's where we're headed you truly
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:21.880]  Now we just made all our subsequent crosses. Yeah, we got the 88 miles per hour. We got the dog
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:25.260]  We got the Marty McFly your seed line just named itself, bro. Good job, Dave
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:30.540]  It's straight names are not only are you a motherboard from his lineup?
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:37.640]  Looks like Rasta Bob is showing us some plants and I'm not even paying attention cuz I'm over here trying to pay attention all this
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.640]  other stuff oh
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.580]  And then he cut out the job at the job book
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:50.040]  Where are you man looking pretty sativa there I was gonna say man
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:57.360]  Some skinny skinny leaves, yeah, yeah, that's gonna be a long flower long finisher there, but I bet the buzz is incredible
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.420]  I like that stuff that gives me like the shakes and the sweats and a panic attack
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:05.380]  It looks like GMF has got to go Jim. F. Thank you for hanging out brother. I will see you in the hood next time
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.240]  Anytime brother, I hope you baked up something good
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:18.920]  420 I'll be making some infused kombucha and some infused low to no alcohol beer. So what y'all know how those turn out
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.040]  I'm interested
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:25.120]  Thanks again Jeff anytime brother Jello
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:32.200]  Yeah, it looks like ship is right Bob wrote in the chat here that that's a land race running
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.280]  Chamba, he's gonna cross it with
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:39.200]  some Jamaican Jamaican ladders you say in boats
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.040]  And he actually wrote not the bold Dave
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.080]  That's why I invited this
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.640]  Awesome, that was rad
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.880]  Can't believe nobody else has any 420 plans
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:08.400]  I'm trying to weasel 420 plans out of you guys so I can find something to do it. Nobody's got any plan
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.680]  420 neighborhood
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:18.800]  Sesh going on 4 p.m. Pacific Standard Time 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:23.960]  So yeah that way we could make the West Coast 420 and East Coast 7, it's awesome
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:27.480]  Pandemic
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:34.740]  So yeah on YouTube it's at the neighborhood grows Instagram and that neighborhood grows YouTube same thing
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:36.740]  we were able to snack both of those and
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:43.120]  Yeah, it's gonna be fun. We're just gonna be hanging out introducing ourselves talking about what we're gonna be
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:49.880]  Covering over the next foreseeable future. Yeah, it'll be a lot of fun. We'll also be discussing
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.280]  Recently a lot of states came online for cannabis
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:58.080]  So we'll also be getting into that a little more
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.880]  Hopefully we'll be we'll be able to talk to people who are actually living in those areas. So
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:10.960]  Yeah, it'll definitely be an interesting conversation. So hope to have have anyone here is welcome to join us as well
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:16.960]  It's just gonna be us hanging out again. And then we will be doing it on Mondays 4 p.m. Pacific Standard Time and 7 p.m.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:22.920]  Learning from you man, you definitely have a lot of stuff to teach. So I'll definitely support your show anytime
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:29.320]  Oh, yeah, you taught me a lot about fungus and agar and tissue culture and all kinds of great things
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:34.200]  So just a little bit of time. I've been asking you questions. You feel you overflow my head or I'm like, okay stop Raptor
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.320]  That's enough. My brains gonna dump out. Yeah any of this shit
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:43.640]  It's a it's a lot of fun for me, that's why I've actually always been interested in horticulture like unknowingly
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:50.440]  I was brought up with in my grandma's garden and she's man an insane grower. She
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:56.040]  The the fruit that I would pick off those trees. It's just always so awesome. So it's delicious
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:02.120]  It's just like oh the leave it alone method, you know, but I'm gonna go left. Those are real growers for all the old-school people
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:06.520]  Learned a lot from her and learned a lot from just going to school and
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:11.080]  Basically focusing on those things that I was interested in this work at him
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:17.480]  Yeah, and I actually got a great start from cannabis or again. I was looking more into
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:20.120]  biochemistry when I actually
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:24.200]  Started growing. So when I started growing I did get
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:27.400]  Introduced to cannabis or again. I was looking more into
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:35.400]  So when I started growing I did get introduced to cannabis or again through embracing organics and just started following him
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:42.360]  Cannabis organic at YouTube great source of knowledge. I really hope to see him come back online someday
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.520]  But with all the amount I learned so much from you. Oh, yeah
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.240]  disappear voluntarily
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:54.400]  Voluntarily, okay. Yeah. Yeah always a bunch of knowledge coming out of there
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:01.280]  I wish him much love just like savvy was saying there's so much knowledge. You can learn from him
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.280]  He's the one that actually got me
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:10.240]  Into my ecology so I got to I got to hang out with him. He took me on my first foray mushroom foray
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:14.800]  That's just mushroom hunting, you know fancy word for mushroom hunting. It was awesome
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:22.080]  I got into that whole world and into horticulture and so much so that I actually switched majors into horticulture
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.880]  So, yeah, it's he was such a big inspiration
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:28.400]  man
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:33.040]  I'm definitely gonna hit him up have his number. He was really he's always been really busy
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:38.040]  you know and you just hit up friends and it's it's in the middle of like some a
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:41.440]  Lot of stuff that they're going through. So yeah, it's about time
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:47.120]  I hit him up again and at very least like once everything calms down. I am going up to the PNW
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:52.840]  Actually plan to go up there at very least twice twice a year to collect much
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:59.920]  Shroom tissue samples and spores to add to my own collection and just for my own little
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.540]  side projects I've been looking into like
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:05.600]  DNA
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.600]  marking for local
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.400]  a
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.760]  Lot of species in my area but specifically mushrooms
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:20.400]  So yeah gonna be starting up that working with operation grow on some other stuff that will be connected to those stuff
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:27.000]  Yeah, I gave him an invite but it's a little late for him. It's right in the middle of his nap time
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:28.920]  Yeah
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:34.960]  But he's a he's a great source of knowledge. I'm happy to be connected to his group as well. They
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.480]  We do a lot
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:43.280]  Got to interview binocular University and he talked a little bit about yeah and
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:51.160]  He got to tell us about polyamorous chain reaction testing. So that's just PCR testing and that's the whole
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:55.040]  How we're able to get met no male and female
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.840]  Before even flower happens
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:00.680]  important also that goes into
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:04.180]  Getting DNA markers. So that's what I'm gonna be looking into
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:08.340]  We'll be we'll be working on stuff like that in the very near future
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:14.820]  It's just a matter of a saving up and doing a little bit of organization who's doing what?
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:21.100]  How are we gonna accomplish this? What sources are we gonna use? So yeah, it's it's gonna be a lot of fun and
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:26.380]  Hopefully we can also share all the knowledge on the neighborhood grows. We actually
[01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:33.780]  Just like mr. Bagsy was saying gonna be starting off with introductory grows and just starting off from
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:38.700]  Step one, you know, where where are you in your bro?
[01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:45.460]  Yeah, yeah, just like you guys are starting with the goal if you don't start with that goal and a plan it all turns to
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:46.940]  Shit, so you're absolutely doing it, right?
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:51.260]  And you guys in the future you younger guys you guys make me feel like I missed a bunch of stuff
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:55.940]  I know I know how my parents feel when I talk about the internet like you guys talk about some growing stuff
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:30:00.620]  And I'm like, where was I when that happened? You guys are younger than me going to school doing all this new technology stuff
[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:05.620]  I love what you guys are bringing to cannabis. That is so impressive to me. I love staying to the roots
[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:09.140]  I keep it simple stupid. I got an air conditioner a light and a dehumidifier
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:09.380]  You know
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:11.380]  I try not to put too many moving parts in there because
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:15.780]  That's when it gets complicated and shit goes wrong. But you guys that have all this science you guys blow my mind. I love it
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:17.780]  It's so amazing to see
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:23.940]  You see Davis right now is actually offering grants to local growers right here to do electoral
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:30.940]  Electronical stimulus to plants basically electrical stimulus to plants to see how they affect the growth and
[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:36.580]  There's really grants for right now and the different electrical stimulus of plants and how it affects in
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:39.060]  stimulates
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.860]  Different functions. Yeah, it's really cool, man
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:45.740]  They're doing a lot of stuff and you can get funded for it and they'll literally pay for everything. It's pretty fucking cool
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:50.140]  Are you in some sort of mythical apothecary room now, or is that just a basic ass kitchen?
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:56.580]  That's a that's just basically out of a college I've worked with a lot of growers in the area and right now
[01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:58.580]  I'm trying to tell you
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:06.020]  Is that a real normal kitchen you're in or is that some mystical apothecary behind you? Oh, no, this is a Japanese kitchen
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:16.300]  Like my whole place is literally the pot I have you said against right now is all just Asian themed
[01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:19.540]  kitchen and living
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:26.940]  Everything I do here. It's like Asian themed. It's pretty cool. We have a giant koi garden fucking is Peace Garden
[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:31.940]  We have Giants sand fucking lot that you can do the rake stuff for Peace Garden
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:42.020]  Right now like we're really in a Japanese kitchen if you have
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.060]  Yeah, it's nicer little katanas
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:48.180]  Yeah, no, and you know
[01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:52.220]  it's it's kind of funny because we really have a watchuma garden a lot of
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:59.100]  Cactuses different versions of different breeds of cactuses going on right now. We even have some traditional stuff
[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:02.940]  You know some maybe some mescal and based stuff
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:06.420]  Allegedly, but um, we have a lot of different
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:12.020]  Kind of little gardens going on right now along the property and they're they're a lot of fun
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:13.500]  We take care of them. We have a greenhouse
[01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:17.900]  Section and then we have also, you know a few private gardens along the property as well
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:21.260]  So, you know, we do all of those Japanese themed as well
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:28.780]  There are there's a koi garden. There's a full fucking pond. There's the full Japanese themed center courtyard
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:33.380]  My question the most important part you have to take your shoes off to go in there
[01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:35.220]  Fuck no, man
[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:41.060]  I mean I should but like I don't know because like, you know, I'm an American so I feel like it doesn't apply to me
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:45.500]  I
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:52.260]  Worry about forest fires with those paper walls
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:55.780]  You know, I mean
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:58.500]  Honestly, we have we've got several fire roads
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:01.460]  We got about 40 acres up here and we got about six fire roads cut out
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:04.820]  all the brush has been cleared around our property as well as we put in a
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.180]  large
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:12.420]  Water reservoirs that the fire department can directly tap into so our house is kind of on the move it's a for zone
[01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:18.460]  Is there like a conch shell or maybe like a ram horn that you blow that summons all of the ninjas?
[01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:20.880]  Or do they just show up at a certain time for class every day?
[01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:23.380]  Well, they show up they show up every two days
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:27.900]  They show up every fucking two days and they do classes and it's fucking awesome and we do weapons training
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:30.060]  It's fucking amazing like you can come down here at any time
[01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:32.260]  If you guys ever want to do a live when they're doing weapons training
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:37.100]  I'll definitely give you guys a stoner's view of some people just to get it back on track of cannabis
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:39.140]  I want to know what did it just do for 420?
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:42.300]  They kick all kick starters asses when they come
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:46.900]  Stone to shit off our edibles. That's what they do
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:52.720]  They we bring them edibles and they come down here and they fight for four hours straight after we give them cookies
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:55.100]  They just stars of death
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:34:01.740]  Yeah, it's all wax off. No, it's a lot of fun. Most of the people on the property here or you know
[01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:06.860]  They're medicated. So a lot of it happens, you know under medication
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:10.740]  So on a scale of one to need a nap how medicated are you right now?
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:19.700]  I'm not as medicated as Jeff because Jeffy smoking like a goddamn freight train and I've seen your fucking half-gram dabs
[01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:27.740]  You take so, you know, my my my smoking a bowl or two here and there is like very small to you and your your dad
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:29.740]  fucking
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:31.740]  The davage man
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:36.820]  All right. Now, what are you doing for 420 brother? Just curious since we've got you highlighted here. What are you doing for 420?
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:41.260]  Actually got I've got actually a bunch of buddies coming up. We're having a big harvest
[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:44.780]  Actually, I planned everything to be dried right at the time of 420
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:49.620]  Really a few days before my entire room is gonna be dried and ready to cured ready to fucking smoke
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:55.780]  So I invite a bunch of friends up. We got a little plot on this property. That's right up along the beach coast and really
[01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:56.540]  It's this flat spot
[01:34:56.540 --> 01:35:01.860]  You can see all the way to Monterey to Santa Cruz Beach line and we're all camping out and we're all doing a big fucking
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:05.620]  Might be allegedly doing mushrooms and a bunch of other shit
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:11.100]  But my whole harvest is coming down and we're gonna have fish blasting in honor of my buddy Jeff here
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.940]  And so we're gonna you know, it's gonna be a good time
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:16.940]  So 420 up it, you know Santa Cruz if you're in the area
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:20.540]  Let me know if I can put you up on the camping list and we'll get you guys all up on there
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:26.460]  I thought you'd shrink them all trim. I was gonna say to those ninjas trim weed real quickly
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:28.780]  They bust out their ninja swords and just get the weed trimmed up
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:33.660]  And they've all got a mask on already so everybody's safe, oh, yeah, dude
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:42.740]  One of them chops it everyone flips it over and then they just do this a few times and it's trimmed. Yes
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:50.060]  Matt I'm glad you made it bro. It's been a long time since we've got to hang out
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:52.060]  So this was fucking fun to get you in here from SoCal
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:58.140]  Midcow not even so Cal mid-cow. Yeah right on the coast man, right between Monterey and San Jose
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:00.860]  Santa Cruz man right in the middle right near the beach
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:10.940]  Ocean grown, you know, I mean, no, I don't know what that means
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:17.500]  Goddamn humidity. That's what it means. So don't feel bad
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:23.780]  That's what it means. Oh, she grow means you get too much goddamn fucking fog off the bay. I was gifted
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:27.860]  I'm not gonna go too deep into this but I was gifted some, California spider mites
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:30.740]  Bro, those Mendo mites are the most voracious
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:34.660]  Fucking mites that I have ever dealt with
[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:41.060]  Shout out to the Mendo mites. It didn't come from behind from your neck of the woods, but no, I know exactly who gave me
[01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:50.860]  Yeah
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:56.020]  Those Cali mites were the worst never had mites like that. They're probably you know, I killed him
[01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:58.140]  Got rid of them Colorado cold
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:02.060]  That's what did it like just get it super cold from the Colorado cold and they were like
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:06.580]  I don't know what to do with this and like they stopped like yeah, I ruined that fuck fest for sure
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:10.460]  That's why that's why it's so important you hit him during veg
[01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:12.140]  That's why I tell everybody's you know
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:18.180]  If you get cuts from people you don't know or you don't fucking have if you aren't sure about their shit fucking quarantine them shits off
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:21.620]  I did all of the protocol but those those mites were
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:23.100]  They were just like, yeah
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:26.260]  Gone and they just all ran out at one time and they'll gave me the finger
[01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:32.020]  I'm flipping you off so hard right now. They just ran away and I tried to hit him with pesticides
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:34.220]  They just laughed at me dude, they were
[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:40.940]  Did you dip the clones in softboil X? It seems to be about the only thing that works for getting ready for me
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:44.340]  don't think I don't have that because that just feels like it's more uh,
[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:47.260]  more harsh than I'm ready for but
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:51.860]  I'll try it. It's probably like a canola some sort of a white oil with a wetting agent or something in there
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:54.580]  But a dip is a good idea
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:59.740]  Yeah, I dip all my clones if it's coming in from off property it gets dipped
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:03.740]  I don't care if I have to take a rooted clone and reroute it
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:07.700]  It's not worth the biosecurity of me, you know risking the facility
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:10.140]  Yeah, it did slow me down quite a bit to be honest with you
[01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:16.220]  It definitely uh that and another thing that I adjusted another learning curve got me. It's really cramping your style. I'm sure
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:20.300]  Yeah, just be sure to tell people that didn't come from my goddamn garden
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:22.300]  You know
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:26.260]  They're ninja mites bro, it's already obvious where they came from their ninja might
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:40.620]  Yeah, the one that feels in feels the insecurity about it
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:45.180]  Mike's comment earlier
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:53.300]  I
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:57.940]  Used to
[01:38:57.940 --> 01:39:00.580]  That I'll never use again. Trust me. I didn't know what I was doing
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:03.180]  Remember when we were new and you'd go to the growth store and you'd be like I have mice
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:05.300]  They'd go here go spray this all over your crop
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:09.940]  And then you get like a wig blister on your arm and you like I wonder what that's from
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:13.900]  Okay, it could have been the pesticides but I hit these plants with this product one time
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:16.700]  We're not gonna talk about what it was cuz fuck me for doing it. I know better now
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:18.860]  I shame on me for ever using that I didn't know better
[01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:20.700]  Fuck the guy at the growth store is what we got to do
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:25.180]  But I use this product and I came in the next day and the spider mites were dead
[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:29.020]  But there were repelling from the plants. It looks like they were like, what do we do?
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:32.200]  I'm out of here and they just threw a fucking web and repelled from the leaves like cliffhanger
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:36.500]  They just died swinging there just a bunch of mites swinging in the fucking fan dead as shit
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:40.340]  That was it was a neat thing to see but oh my god, I'll never use that product again
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:43.820]  I should not have done that. I didn't know any better. I apologize, but I'm honest
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:47.420]  But watching those bugs they're just swinging
[01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:51.140]  What was that organic certified there was an organic certified?
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:57.300]  Might spray that everyone was using in Colorado for a while there and it like everyone had a trash the grows it. What was that?
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:04.860]  Guys lied and said that their product was organic
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:09.540]  But there was other stuff hidden in the product that they weren't claiming so people were failing pesticide tests
[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:13.600]  I went on a podcast episode and I talked about it and then I said hey
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:14.900]  If this is your company
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:19.140]  You've got an open invite to be on my show whenever you'd like so you can come explain this and they never did
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:24.700]  Like I'm sure they heard it because somebody had a country remember that's funny. No, I don't remember
[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:30.580]  I just say I'm so busy doing a podcast. I don't worry about fucking gossipy stuff. I don't have time, bro
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:37.100]  I know half of Colorado dunks in the Eagle 21. So that's why I mentioned that one. That was the number one
[01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:42.340]  Yeah, you know 20s bend in every commercial fucking facility now that shit's gone
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:45.420]  Yeah, it burns off into cyanide gas or something
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:51.100]  So yeah, you can't have that around and if you need that you went too hard on something anyway by a dehumidifier
[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:57.780]  Yeah, no, I'm with you man. I just watch facilities do man. It's not I can know I don't condone it at all
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:40:59.780]  It's just one of those things where it's like
[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:02.020]  Now they've got technology
[01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:07.700]  They come in and they swab the walls and they can tell you what pesticides have been used for like the past two or three
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:12.580]  Years and if they detect an illegal pesticide in there from years ago years ago
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:17.780]  If anybody gets that one, that's funny. I'll wait years ago. They get your pesticides from years ago
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:22.100]  They'll shut you down and kill the crop that you've got and it's all lost. You got to kill everything and start fresh
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:23.180]  So yeah
[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:24.820]  You gotta be careful with what they sprayed in there
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:29.620]  the previous owners could have sprayed something and I bought that facility and now they come in and they test it and they're like
[01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:31.780]  No, we found a middle corporate in the wall and you're like, oh fuck
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:36.580]  Like document when you found that so that we can kill everything before that start fresh
[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:45.820]  I found some super differences being in Colorado and California as far as like the dispensary goes experienced
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:50.020]  Here they don't give you three stickers. They don't check your ID three times
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:53.500]  It almost feels illegal the way they do it here. You fucking walk into a dispensary
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:58.780]  They just take your fucking money and hand you weed. They don't give a shit. They don't give you just like you want a receipt
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:03.820]  You're like nah, I don't give a shit. It's not like Colorado. They don't sticker that shit. There's not three fucking
[01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:08.780]  No plastic shit, they just hand you a fucking bag of weed and they're just like here you go man 40 bucks
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:10.940]  You're like wow, this is great
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:14.940]  It's weird though because coming from Colorado Lily
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:20.460]  They'll check your ID three fucking times literally, you know at each fucking stop of it and make sure you're the same person
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:27.260]  You were ten seconds ago and like stick your shit and I almost respect that more because it is so thorough in Colorado
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:32.980]  Like it was so thorough there and then I got here and it was just like basically was like how much bag you want?
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:39.540]  And I'm just like fucking hell. I guess that one fucking day. Just do you want a receipt? No, I'm good straight
[01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:42.180]  I'm going now. I'm like, what the fuck?
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:48.700]  They shut up and take my money kind of thing
[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:53.700]  You just fucking hand us money. We'll hand you weed you you just get the fuck out of here now
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:56.780]  and it's weird because coming from Colorado where they try to like
[01:42:56.980 --> 01:43:00.660]  They're gonna give you four stickers to tell you that this will cause cancer if you're pregnant
[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:03.100]  Please do not smoke this or if you're you know
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:08.340]  This can may cause all this shit and they'll sticker it three or four times before you can leave the place and then they'll staple
[01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:10.580]  your bag with a receipt on the outside and
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:15.460]  They'll hand it to you and you walk out the door after you've been ID three times here
[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:21.340]  You you hand him ID at the door and they're just like oh you're 21 cool. We go in how much you want
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:25.940]  The first situation the first situation to describe is when it becomes drugs
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:31.460]  They really felt way more black market than I've ever felt my life Lou I walked in I felt like I was talking to stray
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:34.100]  Stoner sitting on his couch fucking smoking weed with me, dude
[01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:39.300]  He was just like here you go fucking 40 bucks dog. I was like straight up sweet. I'm gonna go home now
[01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:42.020]  Beat me a tree fighter. I'll give you a half a gram extra
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:48.820]  Hell yeah, if I can beat you a fucking Mario Kart how much I get off 10% what's up, dude?
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:55.060]  Let's do this the part I don't miss it about buying weed sitting on some dudes fucking couch watching him fucking smoke weed
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:44:00.060]  Watching him fucking finish around a fucking Final Fantasy 7 before I can get an 8 from him like bro
[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:02.660]  Just press pause and give me a bag of weed. I'll do well
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:05.220]  We play Madden for the bag
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:11.700]  I'll bet you the bag. I'll bet you the bag. I'll be champ Madden if I lose I'll pay you double
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:18.660]  Oh shit, do you remember blitz? I had blitz with my shit. Does anybody play blitz back in the day?
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:21.980]  Yeah
[01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:24.060]  No football
[01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:28.900]  That was the football game of choice right there because you got superpowers you could like fucking blow through people and shit
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:30.980]  That's it. Yeah, that's for people who couldn't play Madden
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:38.180]  That was Cal P and Counter-Strike and used to work at a cyber cafe I played real pro games, sorry
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:42.780]  Bad sweats
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:45.900]  Whoo
[01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:52.020]  I don't know what anybody said you all sounded like Charlie Brown's teacher all at once. Go ahead. Don't you?
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:57.980]  I was just saying something stupid. I want to just sound like that. Anyway, I score on Gallagher
[01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:00.740]  You just told everybody how old you are, too
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:04.820]  I said just flip the only way out. Have a good one, bro
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:11.220]  Don't feel bad
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:13.700]  Thanks for being here for New York
[01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:16.700]  Thank you, happy 420 everyone
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:21.780]  Parties of workers I know
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:25.300]  The mighty wrench
[01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:29.300]  Earlier you were asking about what people do for 420 420 is kind of
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:36.620]  Six months roughly away from Thanksgiving. Does anybody else get together with their friends and kind of have like a thanks stone or Thanksgiving?
[01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:41.300]  It's something that I kind of started after we used to do a 420 party back in Philadelphia
[01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:44.580]  We were always super hungry afterwards so one year I just got the idea
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:49.540]  Hey, I'm gonna cook a turkey and we kind of turned into this huge potluck that we had each year
[01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:52.420]  Does anybody else kind of do a friends gathering kind of thing like that?
[01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:58.860]  No, but now that I'm doing this camp I may start doing that fucking hell that sounds
[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:04.620]  Gotta get stoned or need a bunch of fucking rice. It's gonna be miserable. I kind of went the other way I kind of
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:08.220]  That's why I didn't share. I usually reserve that day for myself
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.220]  It's one of
[01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:18.260]  Two or maybe three days out of the year that I take and I just it's mine. I'm pretty greedy with it. That's
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:21.420]  So I kind of went the other way. I
[01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:26.020]  Take my flowers and I do what I want to do. It's usually me and my dog and
[01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:30.140]  We go getting lost in the woods or we go find a lake or we go
[01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:35.420]  It's just usually for me because the rest of my life is so everybody everybody everybody
[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:39.260]  Everybody that's I take that day for me. So I kind of went the other way
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:44.380]  I can totally see why you would go do friends living friends giving and stuff. That's beautiful, but I
[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:46.740]  Went the other way personally
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:51.780]  No, that's that's really great. That's beautiful. Cascadia. It's so beautiful
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:59.940]  I'm hoping that I'm the next day or two in the forest. Yeah, I'm 420
[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:01.940]  With a dog just like
[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:08.820]  Bag of mushrooms in his hand pupils. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna big ol smile on his face. That's the way to do it, man
[01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:15.060]  I had a lot of fun in the woods on my trip. So you enjoy you deserve it you work hard alone
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:17.060]  Time is always good for you
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:19.860]  I'm trying to get Ross to Bob on the show when his connections a little better
[01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:24.340]  It'll just be Bob and I and we're gonna talk a little bit more about another 420 aspect a lot of us aren't even
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:28.900]  Probably aware of only a couple of people in this room probably even understand what I'm hinting at
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:32.820]  So I'll be a cool lesson for a lot of people and we can get Bob on with that
[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:37.220]  High-grade Jamaican internet connection. It'll be just him and I so we can edit stuff out a little easier
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:42.620]  But we'll get you going Bob big respect. Thank you for being able to be available and able to do that for me
[01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:44.620]  Whenever you're ready Ross whenever you're ready
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:53.460]  That's how good the ganja is over there. The smoke, you know really interferes with all that connection. It's yeah that chalice
[01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:01.900]  I saw something online that made me feel weird inside when I read it
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:07.740]  Somebody had a plant outside and it was gonna go into flower and they said how do I stop this from going into flower?
[01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:13.300]  We recommended put a little LED light over it right that way it doesn't go into flower. They asked
[01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:17.060]  They seriously asked will the wind outside
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:20.060]  Blow the light away from the flower
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:23.060]  Keith is cracking up. You've seen this too as a light guy
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:26.780]  The guy drew a fucking picture with
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:42.420]  If you want better efficiency in your growth for your lights put a fan up top it just blow the light around
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:45.020]  I
[01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:54.860]  Always wondered I was wondering that's the whole time don't you guys understand that that light it's photons. I mean, come on
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:04.700]  Why that why the guys would have the fans blowing on their plants like that because you always see the plants like shaking in
[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:05.740]  the wind I'm like
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:07.740]  That's not healthy, right? But
[01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:14.460]  The light onto the plant then that man just mind-blowing dude, I can't believe it I just
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:23.380]  When you are talking I assumed they meant like blowing the light
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:27.260]  itself away like the unit not the
[01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:33.740]  Guess if it's a lightweight the wind could if it's hanging
[01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:36.260]  And
[01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:37.780]  It's like no
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:39.620]  Is that what?
[01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:40.580]  for the sake of
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:46.620]  I wish that's what they were asking but this person truly thought that the lumens or the whatever's the jewels
[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:51.300]  Photons we're gonna get blown away
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:56.180]  Hey, I'm not going which part of
[01:49:56.420 --> 01:50:02.300]  Wherever I'm not even gonna say a place. But yeah, we need to protect this person. They they're a jewel to society
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:04.300]  We very rarely come
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:12.020]  Back to yourself. We got a hit you twice now search was exhaustive
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:20.460]  So you guys when you put your lights outside put up a windscreen to prevent the fucking lumens from being stolen by by the wind
[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:26.880]  So, you know that whole like single photon slit experiment where you get like different scatter patterns
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:32.480]  I always wondered if you took like a grid pattern that was like really microscopic and put it as like a
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:39.480]  Filter on your light if you could get a bigger scatter pattern with the photons. Anyways, just on like a total nerd
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:45.440]  Thing I wish I understood right enough that to understand any of that the double slit experiment
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.360]  Yeah, like a micro light diffuser. That's the that's the concept of a light diffuser
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.920]  in a
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:55.760]  Like a commercial setting they have the lights warehouse. Oh
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:01.040]  Yeah, I'm just talking about between the light and the actual thing anyways, it's totally just like stupid
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:06.240]  Like a magnifying glass will burn it'll help make the light more intense to burn my leaves
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:09.640]  Why can't we put a special shape of lens on there to give us I see where you're going, bro
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:14.160]  Something the same idea just a bunch of little magnifying glasses that are just enough to make it better
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:19.480]  But not enough to burn any lens that you put on top of the LED actually is a decrease in efficiency
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:26.080]  Whether you use a 90-degree lens or any other sort of lenses that you see that the aftermarket a lot of companies use
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.320]  but they all
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:34.120]  They equal inefficiency in the transmission of PPFD to the canopy. So yeah
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:36.760]  The best way is to have nothing between
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:39.440]  LED and your plants
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:48.640]  Turn down the damn LEDs because my plants didn't like a hundred percent. I was amazed they wanted like
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:53.480]  Closer to 50% to introduce them. They had to adjust for a while. My plants were kind of mad at me
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:55.960]  I
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.680]  Got a phantom LED right now
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:59.680]  I had to run it at 60% because
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:03.980]  anything over that started yellow leaves and started getting the curler tips up and I was like
[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:09.840]  Ah you fucking bitches and even if you pulled them off what you thought with an HBS would work at about 60%
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:17.080]  It would work very well, but any more than 60% it was just fucking curling up leaves and make him not happy. I
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:23.240]  Don't know on me they were it was just like hey, that's too much light. I'm gonna go yellow fast
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:29.800]  But I've learned and that's and I'm fucking excited about learning I was like, oh they're going yellow
[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:30.440]  What do I do?
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:33.320]  like I always know what to do in the grow and I walked in there was like, oh
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:36.680]  This is kind of exciting it to see if I could fix them and bring them out of this crap
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:37.640]  But yeah
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:40.200]  I haven't had to do that in a while since I worked at this one commercial girl where
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:44.140]  Felt like a couple of guys were just purposely trying to throw wrenches in the works every day
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:46.320]  To walk in and find out what they did
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:54.280]  Yeah, I kind of wonder like what you guys do with HIV lights that you can't just like raisin dim because
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:53:03.040]  Like if you are giving a plant, you know 18 hours of light in veg and then you cut it down
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:05.600]  You know 33 percent to 12 hours for flower
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:08.320]  You know
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:11.200]  That's 33 percent less light every day
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:17.720]  So like to give them the same intensity and badge and flower like is definitely not optimal
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:23.240]  Well, generally you'd run a much lower wattage or you wouldn't run H IDs in veg
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:28.200]  Anyway, you would probably switch to H IDs once you hit flower for the most part, you know
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:29.560]  315's
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:36.440]  CMA sure kind of the popular veggies like right now but running H IDs in general like you would not want to just run like
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:40.760]  Straight up H IDs and then try to go into flower from there, but the 1212 photo period
[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:44.320]  That's how plants work and they're naturally gonna want to work on that photo period of 1212
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:47.640]  So when you reduce that light, it's just changing how they hermit
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:54.400]  The hormones that are in the plant to switch into flower. It's not a matter of reducing how much light is getting in
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:58.200]  Photosynthesis it needs that to switch into that photo period
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:01.760]  But I would I would say when you veg with HIV
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:07.040]  It's really easy to use the lux meter and use numbers and yeah in bed
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:14.120]  Lauren but it is getting less light but in for you. It's it's a lot higher of a
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:18.120]  light intensity than it is in veg, so
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:27.560]  I have burning curve where it was like clearly getting too much light, but you know, it's like I was pretty high up
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:33.800]  Okay, I have I had them on full blast cuz it's just kind of what we do. Yeah
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.400]  Put it on a letter man. So
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:39.520]  Yeah, so it's just like okay
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:42.760]  No, I had the same learning curve and
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:46.040]  It's getting less late
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:48.960]  time it's getting
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:54.920]  More than dolly I'm gonna kill your camera brother cuz you're kind of cutting out but we'll keep your audio going
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:56.920]  We're gonna stop your video for you. I
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:59.600]  Got you. Yeah
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:02.680]  They sell much better now. Yeah much better
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:05.920]  You're saying sweet
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:10.480]  But so it gets less light in
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:14.720]  Flower a the the
[01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:23.640]  It also gets about double a little more than double the intensity. I would go from about 20 Lux to
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:27.520]  60
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:30.080]  Depending on the cultivar
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:36.240]  So it is getting more light energy in flower
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:40.040]  Even the reduce I
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:45.080]  He's cutting out a lot I'm gonna interrupt him a lot
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:49.000]  I've noticed that I can definitely reduce the amount of hours
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.840]  I run my lights with the LEDs compared to when I was running the HPS is I used to run 20 on and 5 off
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:58.600]  Because I keep mother plants for breeding and I like to keep them growing but definitely not going into flower
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:00.640]  And I want to producing a lot of clones for me
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:06.000]  I was able to put the bedroom down to 18 6 and I don't see any plants trying to flower early
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:11.480]  And I noticed they start drooping later in the day, which tells me they've gotten enough light. They're tired. They're sleepy
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:12.880]  They're ready to take a nap
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:17.240]  So yeah, I'm definitely running less light hours and I've got the LEDs
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:20.880]  I thought that they went that that knob went a hundred percent to zero percent, but it's like
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:24.360]  It's different. So I even turned it down further than I thought I had them
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:27.680]  I've got them less than 50% right now and I've done maybe too close together
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:32.400]  But my plants are loving it now that I kind of figured it out. I get the less hours less intensity
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:35.980]  It feels like if you're giving them the right light, they don't need nearly as much of it
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:42.600]  They're just they're beasting out and I think environment plays a lot in that light, you know, there's guys who run 1113
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:44.600]  I think even Dirtman Dan before didn't
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:51.360]  Epstein embracing or gas where they were talking about doing 1113 is versus the 1212 just to reduce, you know
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:56.320]  The overall monthly light bill, but you can still achieve some of the same goals maybe with a higher TDC
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:02.120]  Ratio giving them more dark to light but just also reduce the you know, one hour a day
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:09.160]  In light cycle, so there's definitely room to play with these photo period plants and I think if you know
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:12.560]  I don't know if you're if you're worried about like some of the
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:20.000]  Differences between the switching in transition, you know, that's part of why like there is that transition period where they say, you know, like
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:24.000]  You know going from flower to you know going from veg to flower
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:29.040]  You probably got a you know a couple days before they start to really take that photo period, you know
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:31.160]  Before they start to show that they're starting those signs
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:35.400]  You'll even notice that they they have that veg cycle down even if you're running in 18-6
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:37.520]  They'll still assume that for the first three or five days
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:42.200]  even in your flower cycle when you first switch and it's just how photo period work and
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:46.640]  Reducing them to that isn't gonna affect them so much if you're still
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:52.820]  Maintaining the same kind of intensity or if you're running to HID from t5s. That's just how we've always ran
[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:59.820]  One thing I've noticed for sure is that the batch of seeds I made under LED lights have the best germination rate of any seeds
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:00.820]  I've ever made
[01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:06.820]  That's that's something I can for sure say these seeds are like all these packs are sealed or I've dumped up dump them out
[01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:09.820]  Show you a look at vacuum seal these packs so can't show you sorry
[01:58:09.820 --> 01:58:12.820]  And if you get them and you're mad that they're sealed don't complain they're sealed, you know, they're tamper-free
[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:16.820]  I've had a couple people be like bro. I tried for an hour to get that open. It's not my fault
[01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:19.820]  You need a helmet and velcro shoes. It's just a fucking heat seal. You can get it open
[01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:26.220]  I'd love to hear Steve's view on you know light cycles and stuff because you know
[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:32.220]  He bases a lot of his stuff especially greenhouse work and stuff like that based on the season cycles of light cycles of the region
[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:34.220]  So I'd definitely like to hear you know
[01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:40.220]  Maybe how he bases a lot more when he starts seasons and you know based on his area of you know
[01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:46.220]  Where he thinks you know different parts of the year better for certain areas. I would love to hear kind of your thoughts on that
[01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:53.220]  Generally they won't help too much within about an hour hour and a half difference when you get past that they really start pouting and you
[01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:58.220]  Might have a bit of a slowdown period where it kind of was curious if it wants to go to flower and it'll go back
[01:58:58.220 --> 01:59:00.220]  to bed most of the time
[01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:02.220]  Or you know just hang a couple of
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:06.220]  of new ones in there and you know, maybe you can get a few more of those
[01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:10.220]  So I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:12.220]  I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea
[01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:14.220]  Or you know just hang a couple of
[01:59:14.220 --> 01:59:21.220]  obnoxious of you know, you go to the Walmart or Lowe's or any of these other box stores after Christmas
[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:26.220]  They always have those like regular LEDs and then the obnoxiously bright white one, right?
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:30.220]  Those obnoxiously bright white ones are great for just thrown over your plants for two hours
[01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:33.220]  Just to give them that extra day, you know on your outdoor
[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:39.220]  There's I mean they're still useful for something and you can get them on clearance, you know after Christmas and oftentimes this time of year
[01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:42.220]  they're discounted because they're not they're not moving
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:45.220]  So that's definitely something else that you know, I like to do now
[01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:51.220]  I will say too on the other direction that I've seen quite a bit of different cultivars particularly in the CBD cultivars
[01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:56.220]  throw male flowers if they're kept under 24 hours of daylight
[01:59:56.220 --> 02:00:00.220]  Even in veg, well, they'd be beautiful, beautiful looking female flowers
[02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:06.220]  But in each node, there's one to four little tiny flowers that are, you know, occasionally throwing pollen
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:12.220]  Now if I drop those same exact plants down to 18-6, they stop doing that
[02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:17.220]  Now the only difference that I've changed on those and that particular grow was the lights
[02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:20.220]  Nothing else changed, no nutrients, no temperature, no
[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:24.220]  That was the only thing and it was the Jamaican Lion Lines and the ACDC lines
[02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:27.220]  were the two that were showing that particular expression
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:33.220]  and I just attributed it to being something to do with CBD because CBD in particular is fairly pigeonhole genetically
[02:00:34.220 --> 02:00:39.220]  Well, pretty much too, there's only a few places in the world where there's 24-hour light
[02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:42.220]  You have the Ruta Wallace in Russia and you have Alaska
[02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:45.220]  There are places where it does the 24-hour situation
[02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:50.220]  I imagine a lot of the photoperiod plants are not prepared honestly for that kind of lighting anyway
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:53.220]  So it makes sense that that would be the case
[02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:57.220]  I think plants are just like humans, keep us awake for 24 hours for a long period of time
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:00:59.220]  We go crazy, plants do that too
[02:00:59.220 --> 02:01:02.220]  They have hormones that have to be produced at nighttime
[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:07.220]  and if they don't have a sleep cycle, it chemically has a hard time producing certain compounds
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:10.220]  and I'm sure it would negatively impact the system of the plant as well
[02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:13.220]  I mean that would probably be the first thing to suffer
[02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:19.220]  When you're thinking about putting them outside and trying to match the daylight hours of outside
[02:01:19.220 --> 02:01:21.220]  Sorry, my brain couldn't think of the word daylight hours
[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:26.220]  When you're trying to match those daylight hours, are you thinking about the far red light that the sun's putting off as it goes down?
[02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:28.220]  Are you compensating for any of that?
[02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:30.220]  I've never worried about that
[02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:34.220]  The only time I've ever tried to worry about that is if I was trying to make them go to sleep faster
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:39.220]  The phytochrome, you know, with the far red triggers that phytochrome in the leaves
[02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:42.220]  and it helps put the plant to sleep and I've seen quite a bit of data that shows that
[02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:44.220]  it does make a pretty significant difference
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:47.220]  You can even eek out an extra half hour or an hour with your lights on
[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:51.220]  if you're really trying to push numbers and still have that same sleep period
[02:01:51.220 --> 02:01:56.220]  as far as that hormone buildup to actually make the plants have that full sleep cycle
[02:01:57.220 --> 02:02:00.220]  Definitely something that you can play with a little bit
[02:02:00.220 --> 02:02:02.220]  I haven't done anything on the outdoor
[02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:05.220]  I'll be honest with you, on all the bigger stuff that I've done the last three years
[02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:09.220]  including Africa, we had a greenhouse facility that was basically the nursery
[02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:12.220]  that cranked out all the production plants
[02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:14.220]  and we did a couple of testers in there and stuff like that
[02:02:14.220 --> 02:02:16.220]  maybe had two or three flowering rooms
[02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:19.220]  and then everything else was just mass produced for the fields
[02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:22.220]  So once we figured out which cultivars were going to give us really good production
[02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:24.220]  we were cloning that out
[02:02:24.220 --> 02:02:27.220]  The consistency of production that you get from clones
[02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:29.220]  still beats the living daylights out of seed
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:32.220]  You need to have that if you're really going to have it
[02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:36.220]  Now, I do think that in another few years they'll get the genetics stabilized
[02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:38.220]  but certainly not with autos
[02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:41.220]  but definitely less so with photos
[02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:45.220]  They're just not stable enough to have mass seed batches that are that
[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:49.220]  over 10,000 or 50 or 100,000 seeds
[02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:53.220]  that are that predictable of a chemo-virus stability
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:56.220]  that doesn't exist and who knows if we'll ever be able to achieve that
[02:02:56.220 --> 02:02:59.220]  Just look at apple trees, they've never achieved that genetically, ever
[02:02:59.220 --> 02:03:05.220]  If you take an apple tree, every single seed off that apple tree is a different pheno
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:10.220]  That's why Johnny Appleseed was able to have so many different strains named after him
[02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:13.220]  and attributed to him, because he planted more phenos than anyone else did
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:14.220]  That's awesome
[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:16.220]  How much knowledge do you bring, brother?
[02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:19.220]  We have a better chance of doing it with cannabis than we do with apple seed
[02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:22.220]  Oh yeah, way better chance, for sure
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:26.220]  I don't mean to say we can't, I'm just saying that we're quite a few years off
[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:29.220]  I hate to interrupt you gentlemen, but we had another lady join the group
[02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:31.220]  We've got to take a moment to welcome the lady
[02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:34.220]  Cass popped in, I'm going to give her a minute to tell us where she's from
[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:35.220]  because that has been the custom
[02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:37.220]  Cass, where are you joining us from tonight?
[02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:39.220]  Cheers from Texas!
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:42.220]  I kind of felt that coming
[02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:44.220]  I kind of felt that coming
[02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:46.220]  I'm not sure if you want people stalking you on social media
[02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:50.220]  but I usually give people a chance to tell us their social media
[02:03:50.220 --> 02:03:53.220]  Tell them how they can find you or your business online if you want to
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:55.220]  or you can tell them to not do that if you want
[02:03:55.220 --> 02:04:00.220]  I will say, Steve, one thing that I heard from a botanist is kind of scary
[02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:01.220]  She got interrupted and went silent
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:04.220]  Sorry Cass, they talked right over your intro
[02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:07.220]  Follow Cass, you guys, if you know how to follow Cass, follow her
[02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:09.220]  Go ahead, bro, what were you saying?
[02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:14.220]  I will say one thing that I've heard from a botanist is that
[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:19.220]  they would like to crop cannabis in the same way that they have done tomatoes
[02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:23.220]  and potatoes in our grocery stores
[02:04:23.220 --> 02:04:28.220]  to where it's very much the same crop that they produce massively on tissue culture levels
[02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:31.220]  to where it's one specific thing
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:36.220]  and I've heard botanists talk about trying to stabilize out cannabis into the way
[02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:37.220]  to where they can do that as well
[02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:41.220]  which I don't think they'll be able to do because cannabis lovers also love variety
[02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:45.220]  but it is one of the things that if they were to go to Federal that they've talked about
[02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:50.220]  a lot of botanists are very big on the unit cropping idea of monetizing
[02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:53.220]  and just trying to make one crop that you can reproduce nonstop
[02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:57.220]  that's just commercially viable and it's going to be a heavy load
[02:04:57.220 --> 02:04:59.220]  No way, bro, we'll get tired of that so quickly
[02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:01.220]  I go to the dispensary and I never buy the same thing two times in a row
[02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:03.220]  unless it's something I bred and they got it
[02:05:03.220 --> 02:05:05.220]  but every time I go I get different concentrates
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:08.220]  Yeah, but how many times do you ask for a different tomato at the grocery store, dog?
[02:05:08.220 --> 02:05:10.220]  How many times do you ask for different tomatoes?
[02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:12.220]  That's a different ballgame
[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:15.220]  I got romas, I got cherries, I got those purple hearts
[02:05:15.220 --> 02:05:17.220]  but yeah, I think there's always and if that does happen
[02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:20.220]  you're always going to be growing fucking something you bred
[02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:22.220]  and I'm going to be growing something I bred
[02:05:22.220 --> 02:05:24.220]  and hopefully Steve's growing something he bred
[02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:26.220]  and hopefully Painted Lady's growing something I bred
[02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:32.220]  Yeah, I've heard rumors from several botanists and several people on the multi-million dollar
[02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:35.220]  kind of commercial facilities who are trying to sell hardcore monocrops
[02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:39.220]  so they can just get these consistent shit that's just all the same
[02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:44.220]  and it's just kind of horrifying to think because we all love so much variety as cannabis consumers
[02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:49.220]  Don't forget that the gentleman that brought you quote unquote outrageous new strains
[02:05:49.220 --> 02:05:51.220]  was summarily fired two weeks ago
[02:05:51.220 --> 02:05:56.220]  To their credit, just because they want to monocrop something doesn't mean it's going to suck
[02:05:56.220 --> 02:06:01.220]  and it doesn't mean they won't monocrop enough varieties to fill a Walmart
[02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:09.220]  I'm not for that game, I'm just playing devil's advocate
[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:18.220]  If they've got the resources to line breed one into homogeny
[02:06:18.220 --> 02:06:20.220]  they can do that again
[02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:23.220]  So if they can offer you one that they can grow by the acre
[02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:26.220]  watch out because in five years they'll offer you ten
[02:06:26.220 --> 02:06:29.220]  Well, that's what they do right now in Idaho with the potato crops
[02:06:29.220 --> 02:06:31.220]  Literally my family has several potato farms up there
[02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:36.220]  and right now Lay's and fucking Pringles have their own potato that they tissue culture
[02:06:36.220 --> 02:06:38.220]  and every time they produce the same potato
[02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:42.220]  They only have the same potato that they monocrop for those companies
[02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:46.220]  because they're specifically bred to be what that company wants
[02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:48.220]  It's the certain shape that works well on their machines
[02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:50.220]  It's the certain shape that cuts to the right point
[02:06:50.220 --> 02:06:55.220]  Certain ones want elongated potatoes, certain ones want rounded potatoes
[02:06:56.220 --> 02:07:00.220]  Depending on the company, they'll monocrop it out and tissue culture it to the end of existence
[02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:02.220]  We've got to cut up potatoes
[02:07:02.220 --> 02:07:04.220]  I said tomatoes, what's wrong with my brain injury?
[02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:06.220]  I did that the other day talking about potatoes
[02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:08.220]  On the potato podcast
[02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:13.220]  Bobby, you look like you were lining up to say something just now
[02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:18.220]  There's no rapper talking about fucking Idaho's and Russets
[02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:19.220]  Nobody's got no rappers
[02:07:19.220 --> 02:07:22.220]  So as soon as a rapper starts rapping about potatoes, then it'll change
[02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:23.220]  Everybody wants different weed
[02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:25.220]  Everybody's going to always want different weed
[02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:29.220]  I'm a breeder and I know that the monocrop idea will work a little bit in a big old commercial
[02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:32.220]  Those guys in this facility monocrop it the shit out
[02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:35.220]  Nobody buys one pack of seeds from me
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:39.220]  They always get two packs and they always get multiple different kinds
[02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:43.220]  I don't see too many of the home growers in the basement bucking ears doing that
[02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:49.220]  No, not the home growers
[02:07:49.220 --> 02:07:51.220]  When you've got somebody that wants to launch
[02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:55.220]  Now, you've got to open your mind a little bit, look into the future a little bit
[02:07:55.220 --> 02:07:58.220]  But when you've got somebody that wants to launch an international product
[02:07:58.220 --> 02:08:01.220]  And they need reproducible cannabinoids
[02:08:01.220 --> 02:08:05.220]  They need a stabilized line that can grow the same year to year to year
[02:08:05.220 --> 02:08:12.220]  To keep their product as consistent as you expect your cognac to be
[02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:14.220]  It's a different ballgame
[02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:18.220]  You'll always have the people that are making the
[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:20.220]  You'll always have the exotic mics of the world
[02:08:20.220 --> 02:08:22.220]  But you're going to have
[02:08:22.220 --> 02:08:25.220]  Yeah man, some of us have to grow mids, okay?
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:27.220]  Some of us have to grow mids
[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:33.220]  And if we grow mids, we're going to grow a lot of it
[02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:35.220]  Alright? A whole lot
[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:38.220]  We used to treat tobacco as Indians walking the day
[02:08:38.220 --> 02:08:40.220]  Personal tobacco
[02:08:40.220 --> 02:08:42.220]  Right now, people only know two
[02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:45.220]  Red cigarette or green cigarette
[02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:48.220]  It's only two types they have, menthol or some red type
[02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:52.220]  So once you have it a lot in the morning, it will be offered in the future
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:54.220]  The greatest thing about the ganja pie
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:57.220]  It will always get bigger and bigger and bigger
[02:08:57.220 --> 02:08:59.220]  So the craft market will grow
[02:08:59.220 --> 02:09:03.220]  And our little mid market will get there eventually
[02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:06.220]  So everybody will have a nice piece of the pie to eat
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:08.220]  Do you guys get strain lock?
[02:09:08.220 --> 02:09:10.220]  Do you guys get tired of smoking the same thing?
[02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:11.220]  Like if I gave you
[02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:13.220]  If I was like, you could have 100 pounds of herb
[02:09:13.220 --> 02:09:15.220]  Would you want like 100 pounds of
[02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:16.220]  Mike's favorite strain is the Grateful Dog
[02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:18.220]  Are you still taking 100 pounds of Grateful Dog?
[02:09:18.220 --> 02:09:19.220]  Or are you going to switch up and want some
[02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:20.220]  Strawberry or Muted, bro?
[02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:22.220]  Do you want some strawberry cough?
[02:09:22.220 --> 02:09:24.220]  10, 10, 10, 10
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:28.220]  Yeah, you got to split that up in fives or tens or something
[02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:31.220]  And thank God we got
[02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:34.220]  We got like Rasta Bob out there keeping stuff, you know
[02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:37.220]  Keeping things natural, you know
[02:09:37.220 --> 02:09:40.220]  We got a lot of interbred stuff here in the States
[02:09:40.220 --> 02:09:42.220]  I'm really proud of Rasta Bob keeping everything kind of
[02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:45.220]  Irish and fucking traditional, you know
[02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:47.220]  That's on grown herb
[02:09:47.220 --> 02:09:49.220]  You just call me an inbreeder?
[02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:51.220]  You just call me an inbreeder?
[02:09:51.220 --> 02:09:54.220]  I mean, no, I'm sure you keep it traditional too
[02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:56.220]  You know, I mean, you supply some stuff, you know
[02:09:56.220 --> 02:09:58.220]  For some incredible people too, my guy
[02:09:58.220 --> 02:10:01.220]  But, you know, I am proud of Rasta Bob for staying with tradition
[02:10:01.220 --> 02:10:02.220]  I got to troll you, man
[02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:03.220]  You came in hot tonight
[02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:04.220]  I got to troll you back
[02:10:04.220 --> 02:10:06.220]  You came in hot, you're going to get trolled
[02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:07.220]  Don't make me rush you, Jeff
[02:10:07.220 --> 02:10:09.220]  Don't make me rush you right now
[02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:10.220]  Come dab at the new table, bro
[02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:11.220]  You haven't been to the new table
[02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:12.220]  We got to get you sober, man
[02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:14.220]  I'm worried about your safety
[02:10:14.220 --> 02:10:18.220]  Oh man, yeah, I had a bad medical visit today
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:21.220]  So I'm trying not to stress too hard on that right now
[02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:22.220]  Yeah, I wasn't going to go there
[02:10:22.220 --> 02:10:23.220]  But if you need anything, bro
[02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:25.220]  Everybody in this chat's got your back
[02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:26.220]  So I like trolling on you
[02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:28.220]  But definitely nothing but love for you
[02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:30.220]  Come sit at the table and take some dabs, for sure
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:32.220]  You know, I love you guys
[02:10:32.220 --> 02:10:33.220]  I love a lot of you
[02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:36.220]  I don't want a hundred pounds of the same weed
[02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:38.220]  I want a lot of different weed
[02:10:38.220 --> 02:10:39.220]  Because I feel like I get
[02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:40.220]  I don't know
[02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:42.220]  I feel like after a certain amount of time
[02:10:42.220 --> 02:10:44.220]  It just doesn't do it for me anymore
[02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:46.220]  And then I have switched up and then go back to it
[02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:48.220]  And we have to be grateful
[02:10:48.220 --> 02:10:50.220]  We have to be grateful that we are at this point
[02:10:50.220 --> 02:10:51.220]  We can be picky
[02:10:51.220 --> 02:10:53.220]  Usually it was high grade
[02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:54.220]  Or no grass
[02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:56.220]  So you can be picky now
[02:10:56.220 --> 02:10:59.220]  Would you have no herb or some herb?
[02:10:59.220 --> 02:11:01.220]  I'm a conro, you are
[02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:02.220]  You got to have some herb
[02:11:02.220 --> 02:11:04.220]  At least if I can get a country and quality
[02:11:04.220 --> 02:11:06.220]  Within that some herb
[02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:08.220]  You can get a red stripe or a green stripe
[02:11:08.220 --> 02:11:10.220]  Or a gold stripe one
[02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:11.220]  You at least know what you're getting
[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:13.220]  When you run out in between, alright?
[02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:14.220]  Respect
[02:11:14.220 --> 02:11:17.220]  There's a couple things
[02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:20.220]  There's a couple things I've had in my lifetime
[02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:21.220]  Just a couple
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:23.220]  Where I could smoke a hundred pounds of that
[02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:25.220]  And not complain
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:27.220]  And not ask for anything different
[02:11:27.220 --> 02:11:29.220]  Maybe two or three, but that's it
[02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:30.220]  You're going to have to tell me a lead
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:32.220]  Yeah, we only know one of them at least
[02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:34.220]  You got to think of us like that
[02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:36.220]  There's nothing
[02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:38.220]  Nothing did me like the 98 Bubba
[02:11:38.220 --> 02:11:39.220]  What did you say again?
[02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:40.220]  That shit you all
[02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:41.220]  What was it?
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:44.220]  The pre-98 Bubba set me back, man
[02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:46.220]  That was a life-changing experience
[02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:51.220]  And if you ever get a real sour
[02:11:51.220 --> 02:11:52.220]  A real sour
[02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:54.220]  Not some shit that somebody called sour
[02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:56.220]  But a real sour
[02:11:56.220 --> 02:11:58.220]  That shit will blow you right off your feet
[02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:00.220]  We'll leave shipwreck
[02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:02.220]  White Mike
[02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:07.220]  Alright, let me help the panel a little bit
[02:12:07.220 --> 02:12:08.220]  Let me help the panel a little bit
[02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:09.220]  Connection fluid
[02:12:09.220 --> 02:12:12.220]  What about that strain that we always go through?
[02:12:12.220 --> 02:12:14.220]  We might not want to admit it
[02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:18.220]  But we find ourselves just going back to it every now and then
[02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:19.220]  We just want to grow it again
[02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:21.220]  If we get a cut, we're going to run it again
[02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:24.220]  We just always have to have it
[02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:26.220]  So it kind of grows on you
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:28.220]  Some of them grows on you
[02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:31.220]  Brew, Raspberry, Buffalo, Truffle, wink wink
[02:12:32.220 --> 02:12:34.220]  That's your job
[02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:36.220]  I love doing poison
[02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:38.220]  I can't get rid of the lemon G
[02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:40.220]  I mean the turps are just too good
[02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:42.220]  That makes me smile
[02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:44.220]  I'm with Cascadian with that Bubba, man
[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:46.220]  I just can't get away from it
[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:47.220]  It's so good
[02:12:47.220 --> 02:12:50.220]  The pre-98 Bubba and the Hollywood Pure Code
[02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:51.220]  Those two
[02:12:51.220 --> 02:12:52.220]  Oh yeah
[02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:54.220]  Dude, we have a similar flavor palette
[02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:56.220]  The sweetness, the funkiness
[02:12:56.220 --> 02:12:58.220]  Let me get one out of the jar real quick
[02:12:59.220 --> 02:13:01.220]  I think mine would have to be
[02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:03.220]  I got some really amazing seeds from Dragonfly Earth Medicine
[02:13:03.220 --> 02:13:05.220]  A G13 hash plant
[02:13:05.220 --> 02:13:08.220]  I could smoke that every day, the whole day, all day
[02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:10.220]  And it just puts me in a really good headspace
[02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:12.220]  Where I can get a ton of stuff done
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:13.220]  And focus really well
[02:13:13.220 --> 02:13:15.220]  And it just makes me happy
[02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:16.220]  Nice
[02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:17.220]  How about you, Sequence? You've been quiet
[02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:19.220]  What do you like to smoke?
[02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:21.220]  I got this Crescendo behind my head
[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:22.220]  I can smoke a lot of that
[02:13:22.220 --> 02:13:24.220]  But Mac, GMO
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:26.220]  Probably some stuff like that
[02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:29.220]  Mike's got some Crescendo concentrates
[02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:31.220]  That company makes a great Crescendo banner
[02:13:31.220 --> 02:13:32.220]  Really nice
[02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:33.220]  GMO is a really potent strain
[02:13:33.220 --> 02:13:36.220]  So it's one, like, if you were going to put a lot of it in front of yourself
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:37.220]  That's one that you would pick
[02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:39.220]  Because it almost always tests at like 30 plus percent
[02:13:39.220 --> 02:13:41.220]  And, you know
[02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:43.220]  If you're going to have a shitload of a strain
[02:13:43.220 --> 02:13:44.220]  And you're going to get a tolerance to it
[02:13:44.220 --> 02:13:46.220]  You might as well get one that will get you there
[02:13:46.220 --> 02:13:47.220]  Yeah
[02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:51.220]  If you guys ever come across the Stardog Cory cut
[02:13:52.220 --> 02:13:53.220]  Thank me later
[02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:55.220]  You won't be disappointed
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:59.220]  Is that the one that smells kind of like strawberries and watermelons
[02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:01.220]  And kind of real good for a commercial, bro?
[02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:04.220]  I don't... I didn't get that from you
[02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:05.220]  Okay
[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:08.220]  I think that's allegedly the cut that I made Starstruck with
[02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:09.220]  Allegedly
[02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:10.220]  But I have no proof of that
[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:12.220]  I haven't heard that before
[02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:14.220]  What Island Fire have there, Bob?
[02:14:15.220 --> 02:14:17.220]  I think that's the Bubba
[02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:19.220]  Oh, shit
[02:14:19.220 --> 02:14:21.220]  Yeah
[02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:24.220]  Oh, what is that Bubba?
[02:14:24.220 --> 02:14:26.220]  Look at his face
[02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:27.220]  Three, it's three
[02:14:27.220 --> 02:14:29.220]  This one is fresh
[02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:32.220]  I mean, the cut is about maybe a year and a half
[02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:35.220]  But this is maybe up to like three months
[02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:37.220]  Right in my perfect smoking zone
[02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:38.220]  Right, yeah
[02:14:38.220 --> 02:14:40.220]  And I hate to admit it
[02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:41.220]  But I will admit it
[02:14:41.220 --> 02:14:43.220]  I just keep getting it
[02:14:43.220 --> 02:14:46.220]  You know, I always have a zip or a quarter or a handful
[02:14:46.220 --> 02:14:47.220]  Yeah, right now
[02:14:47.220 --> 02:14:48.220]  Or a half quarter
[02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:50.220]  What's it smell like to Bob?
[02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:52.220]  What does Bubba smell like to Bob?
[02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:55.220]  Alright, this one is sweet
[02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:57.220]  But it's not that artificial sweet
[02:14:57.220 --> 02:15:02.220]  It's like sugary but very mild sugar
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:05.220]  Not like, how would I say?
[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:07.220]  Like maple-y but not super sweet
[02:15:07.220 --> 02:15:10.220]  If you understand, it's not the sweet part of maple
[02:15:10.220 --> 02:15:11.220]  It's more like that honeysuckle
[02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:13.220]  I don't know, it's kind of...
[02:15:13.220 --> 02:15:14.220]  The earthy type
[02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:16.220]  Earthy and, you know, earthy and sweet
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:18.220]  You know, it's sweet earthy
[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:21.220]  But it's not like super sugary, loud candy
[02:15:21.220 --> 02:15:24.220]  You understand, it's kind of mellow
[02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:25.220]  Earthy, mellow sweet
[02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:26.220]  Yeah, like a subtle...
[02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:28.220]  It's the same vibration it gives
[02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:30.220]  The same vibration it gives
[02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:32.220]  You know, you smoke it, it's kind of very smooth
[02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:34.220]  The first one, you say, oh, it's very nice
[02:15:34.220 --> 02:15:36.220]  And by the second or third pull
[02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:38.220]  Bubba will hug you up
[02:15:38.220 --> 02:15:40.220]  Give you one of them big bugger hugs, you know
[02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:42.220]  Hug you up like Bubba
[02:15:42.220 --> 02:15:43.220]  But it's nice
[02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:45.220]  It's a very pleasurable, you know
[02:15:45.220 --> 02:15:46.220]  And you can go to it consistently
[02:15:46.220 --> 02:15:48.220]  I really have to say
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:51.680]  Anybody else got to go to?
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:53.680]  Oh, Mr. Bagsy made it back, hey!
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:54.680]  Anybody else got to go to straight
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:56.680]  That you can just smoke 50 pounds of
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:15:57.680]  And never get tired of it?
[02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:00.680]  We beat that question
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:01.680]  Anything really
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:02.680]  Smoke anything, I don't know, yeah
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:04.680]  There we go, someone who's grateful
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:05.680]  Someone who's grateful
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:07.680]  Cass, you've been super quiet
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:09.680]  Is there anything you could smoke 100 pounds of
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:10.680]  And not get burned out?
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:13.680]  I don't think so
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:16.680]  You're a diamond dabber, aren't you?
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:17.680]  More into diamonds and shit
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:18.680]  Which part?
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:19.680]  The not get burned out part
[02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:21.680]  The 100 pounds, like
[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:23.680]  You can't just smoke any amount of anything
[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:25.680]  Or varieties, the spice of it
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:26.680]  Oh, Lord
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:29.680]  Sauces and spices
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:36.680]  I'm sure of it
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:38.680]  Me and Keith kinda hang in the dab
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:40.680]  That same dab, what do you call it?
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:41.680]  You know, the box
[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:42.680]  Micro dabs
[02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:43.680]  Micro dabs
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:45.680]  The kindergarten dab room
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:46.680]  Yeah, yeah
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:47.680]  I can relate
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:51.680]  Yeah, half a quarter dabs
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:53.680]  Really set you right
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:55.680]  Half quarters all day
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:57.680]  Shout out to the half quarter gang
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:16:59.680]  You might be able to smoke me under the table
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:00.680]  With concentrates
[02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:02.680]  But I can make a fucking magic trick
[02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:03.680]  Out of your weed
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:05.680]  Wow
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:06.680]  I can smoke your weed out
[02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:09.680]  Your flowers, but I can't hang on the concentrates
[02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:11.680]  We've all got our thing
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:13.680]  Edibles make me goofy if I eat too many, so
[02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:15.680]  I don't like smoking
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:16.680]  I heard somebody mention garlic earlier
[02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:18.680]  And I can tell you, the garlic we have really did good
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:19.680]  We tried it out here
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:21.680]  And I can tell you, the crosses and the blends
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:24.680]  So, this is one of our garlic productions
[02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:25.680]  I can tell you
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:27.680]  I don't know if you remember that drink
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:28.680]  Horlicks
[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:31.680]  Like, Ovaltine
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:33.680]  Or, we have one they call Horlicks
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:34.680]  So, they call it garlic
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:35.680]  You know, kinda garlic
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:36.680]  But a little bit sweeter
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:39.680]  But still has that garlic smell, you know
[02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:40.680]  And it's strong
[02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:41.680]  The effect, I don't know
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:43.680]  GMO, I'm not familiar with the names
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:44.680]  But that garlic
[02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:46.680]  The garlic therps or whatever
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:47.680]  Really, really is doing
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:51.680]  It and the peanut butter made a nice influence on the market
[02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:52.680]  Oh yeah
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:54.680]  It was all candy and dessert
[02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:56.680]  And wedding cake
[02:17:56.680 --> 02:17:57.680]  And this kind of sugary
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:17:59.680]  This and donuts and ice cream
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:01.680]  And the garlic and the peanut butter
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:04.680]  Just kind of, you know, really diversified
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:05.680]  The portfolio
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:07.680]  Sounds pretty good
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:08.680]  When you come back to Michigan, Bob
[02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:10.680]  We'll get you real acquainted with that GMO
[02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:11.680]  Don't worry
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:12.680]  Yeah
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:13.680]  GMO's impressive
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:14.680]  I'm doing some long push-ups
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:15.680]  Don't worry
[02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:16.680]  Every day I'm doing my long push-ups
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:17.680]  Exercise of lungs
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:18.680]  I saw
[02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:19.680]  GMO's like
[02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:20.680]  It's like narcotic
[02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:21.680]  It's got
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:22.680]  It feels like other drugs
[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:23.680]  It goes through your body in a different way
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:24.680]  It feels so nice
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:25.680]  It's like a hug
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:26.680]  It's like a big garlic hug
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:29.680]  But I'm gonna
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:31.680]  Push up somebody real quick
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:34.680]  Just make sure you plant better than Painted Lady
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:36.680]  It's nothing
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:38.680]  Hey, I'm gonna head out of here
[02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:40.680]  Before I turn into a pumpkin, guys
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:42.680]  You make a great pumpkin, brother
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:43.680]  Cheers
[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:44.680]  Appreciate it
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:45.680]  We'll see you next time
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:46.680]  Thanks for being here
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:49.680]  Anytime you want to chill and do a podcast or whatever
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:50.680]  Just hit me up
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:51.680]  I like that
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:52.680]  I definitely do
[02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:54.680]  I'll text you later today to say thanks for this
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:55.680]  Awesome
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:56.680]  Congrats on the new baby, by the way
[02:18:56.680 --> 02:18:57.680]  Yeah, yeah
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:18:59.680]  I'm sure you can hear him in the background
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:00.680]  I'll enjoy it
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:01.680]  Breeding projects running
[02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:02.680]  Later, Steve
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:04.680]  Breeding project, man
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:05.680]  You forgot to pull out
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:06.680]  You didn't
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:08.680]  All right, guys
[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:09.680]  We've been going for a long time
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:11.680]  We've been going for like two hours and 40 minutes
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:13.680]  This is gonna be a long ass YouTube video
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:14.680]  I might edit some of this
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:15.680]  I might not
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:17.680]  I haven't made any of those decisions yet
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:19.680]  I'm gonna start right now and say
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:20.680]  Thank you, guys
[02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:21.680]  This was a good time
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:23.680]  Thanks for giving me two and a half hours of everybody's evening
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:24.680]  That was awesome
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:27.680]  Does anybody have any fun shit they'd like to say that they got skipped on left out of
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:30.680]  Before we start wrapping up this two hour and 45 minute show?
[02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:32.680]  I just
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:33.680]  Appreciate you
[02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:36.680]  I'm gonna say if you're out there and you don't have a community
[02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:37.680]  Kind of like we have here on this
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:38.680]  Go create one
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:39.680]  Start a local grow club
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:41.680]  We didn't have one down here in Southern Oklahoma
[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:45.680]  We just got together with a local hookah lounge and we're like, hey, can we host the thing there?
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:48.680]  And they're like, yeah, we can't have anybody here right now because of COVID
[02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:49.680]  So sure
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:52.680]  So now they let us every every second Tuesday of every month
[02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:55.680]  We can kind of take over the hookah lounge and we bring traffic to there
[02:19:55.680 --> 02:19:57.680]  And and it's kind of on a neutral territory
[02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:00.680]  So dispensaries can all come there and no one's feeling weird about it
[02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:02.680]  And share knowledge, share your grow knowledge
[02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:05.680]  You know, if you're the person who knows the most in your area
[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:06.680]  Teach the other people around you
[02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:08.680]  You know, go be the person out there that it's about 420 people
[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:10.680]  It's not there that it's what 420 is all about
[02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:15.680]  It's sharing with the knowledge and seeds and everything else that we have and the fruits of our labor
[02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:17.680]  So go out there and create communities wherever you are
[02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:21.680]  And you'd be surprised how quickly, you know, all kinds of cool things happen
[02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:22.680]  I love that, Steve
[02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:24.680]  There's a there's a Steve in every state, every community
[02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:26.680]  You guys, somebody just has to step up and be that guy
[02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:28.680]  White Mike is not in the chat right now
[02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:31.680]  I don't see him, but White Mike would say do your political part
[02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:34.680]  If you're the guy that does the lobbying, the politics part, do that part
[02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:35.680]  Fill that role
[02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:37.680]  Everybody in here does a role in the cannabis community
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:39.680]  I make the seeds, Keith makes the lights
[02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:40.680]  Everybody does a part in here
[02:20:40.680 --> 02:20:43.680]  So find your role, find your niche in that community and step up
[02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:44.680]  You're absolutely right, Steve
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:45.680]  Thank you, I appreciate you for saying that
[02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:46.680]  That's awesome, dude
[02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:47.680]  Build the community
[02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:48.680]  Join ours also
[02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:49.680]  You could be a part of ours
[02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:51.680]  There's, I do my own show, my own style
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:53.680]  Steve's show is his show, a different style
[02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:55.680]  But both shows are fucking awesome in their own right
[02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:57.680]  Embracing Organics is a great show
[02:20:57.680 --> 02:20:58.680]  All the shows out there, watch them all
[02:20:58.680 --> 02:20:59.680]  Find the one that works for you
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:01.680]  I mean, you may hate my show and love Steve's
[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:03.680]  Or you may love mine and Steve's and hate the other ones out there
[02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:05.680]  Find the ones that are the best for you
[02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:07.680]  We aren't mad at you if you don't watch our show
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:08.680]  We don't even know, honestly
[02:21:08.680 --> 02:21:11.680]  So, yeah, join our community, create your own, spread the vibe
[02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:13.680]  Team Cannabis, that's what it's all about
[02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:15.680]  We want to make all this legal for everybody, everywhere
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:17.680]  So nobody has to go to jail for cannabis
[02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:19.680]  Nobody has to fucking worry about getting medicine
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:20.680]  Nobody has to worry about recreating
[02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:24.680]  And us grow enthusiasts can just grow our fucking asses off to keep all those people happy
[02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:25.680]  So, great message, Steve
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:26.680]  Anybody else got anything else out there?
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:27.680]  Because I talk a lot
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:31.680]  I just wanted to quick thank everybody that's in here, man
[02:21:31.680 --> 02:21:33.680]  Steve, it has been a pleasure to fucking talk to you again
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:35.680]  Fucking since the Indo Expo
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:37.680]  Hey, ladies, always great to hear from you
[02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:39.680]  Everybody in here, thank you guys for being in here, man
[02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:41.680]  It's always a pleasure to talk to all you guys
[02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:43.680]  And, you know, Jeff especially, man
[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:45.680]  You're an old friend of mine and I can't wait
[02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:46.680]  Thanks for hanging out, man
[02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:49.680]  Fucking, this has been an awesome experience
[02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:50.680]  It's been fun, bro
[02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:51.680]  Thank you for joining us
[02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:52.680]  We'll have to see you soon, man
[02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:53.680]  Mike and I look forward to seeing you
[02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:56.680]  You're gonna come out here or we're gonna go out there and harass the shit out of you sometime soon
[02:21:56.680 --> 02:21:57.680]  Can't wait
[02:21:57.680 --> 02:21:59.680]  Santa Cruz, bro, in the summertime
[02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:01.680]  Gotta take somebody out there and go visit
[02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:03.680]  Anybody else got any final words?
[02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:04.680]  Jerry's moments?
[02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:06.680]  What do they call it at the end when Jerry did that shit?
[02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:07.680]  Jerry's moments, Jerry's thoughts
[02:22:07.680 --> 02:22:08.680]  Jerry's final thoughts
[02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:09.680]  Who's got that for us today?
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:14.680]  Just thank you so much for having all the cross-platform love
[02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:19.680]  I was trying to count all the shows that were being repped because of you
[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:24.680]  Like here, yours, Potentronics, The Neighborhood
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:27.680]  Shout out to Operation Bro
[02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:32.680]  We had N, Cousin, Truby Show, Seth Greed
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:35.680]  What was it? Remind me again, what's the show?
[02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:38.680]  Grow 4 Show
[02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:40.680]  Grow 4 Show, please check them out
[02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:42.680]  Check us out, Neighborhood
[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:45.680]  And gosh, that's awesome
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:46.680]  Michigan Bros Grow Show
[02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:48.680]  Michigan Bros Grow Show, exactly
[02:22:48.680 --> 02:22:50.680]  Yeah, everything organics is repped on here
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:52.680]  We've got a lot of people covered
[02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:53.680]  Awesome, thank you for having us
[02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:55.680]  It's nice to get a list like that, you're in for it
[02:22:56.680 --> 02:22:58.680]  Yeah, that's why I try to avoid it
[02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:00.680]  Yeah, that's why I'm listing everything off
[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:03.680]  You go to edit and you're like, oh shit, I forgot someone real important
[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:04.680]  They're going to hate me
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:05.680]  Shout out to all the shows
[02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:06.680]  Much love to all
[02:23:06.680 --> 02:23:09.680]  Exactly, and exactly, cannabis community
[02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:12.680]  Really appreciate all the cross-platform love
[02:23:12.680 --> 02:23:13.680]  That's what it should be about
[02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:15.680]  We're all just trying to learn
[02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:17.680]  We're all just trying to do better for ourselves
[02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:20.680]  And the people that we care about in our community
[02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:22.680]  Just like Potentronics was saying
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:24.680]  Do what you can locally
[02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:26.680]  Do what you can through the internet
[02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:29.680]  Even with whatever position you are in your job
[02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:31.680]  You can make a difference
[02:23:32.680 --> 02:23:34.680]  Absolutely, that's a great way to wrap it up
[02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:37.680]  Yes, don't be a dick and show love
[02:23:37.680 --> 02:23:38.680]  That's probably the best way to wrap it up
[02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:39.680]  Good note there, Dave
[02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:42.680]  Good reminder, it's amazing that that came from you
[02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:44.680]  Anyway, thank you guys
[02:23:44.680 --> 02:23:45.680]  Thanks everybody for joining me
[02:23:45.680 --> 02:23:48.680]  This was awesome to have such a loyal group of friends
[02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:49.680]  I honestly didn't know how many people would show up
[02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:50.680]  So this was amazing
[02:23:50.680 --> 02:23:52.680]  Big shout out to everybody on every screen I'm looking at
[02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:54.680]  Big love, much respect for all of you guys
[02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:56.680]  I look forward to getting all of you on a show individually
[02:23:56.680 --> 02:23:59.680]  Talking a little bit more about your specified topic
[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:00.680]  I know everybody here has a special niche
[02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:02.680]  Big shout out to everybody watching
[02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:03.680]  I'm going to sign off with my friends here
[02:24:03.680 --> 02:24:06.680]  Say goodbye, and then I'll be back to do an official wrap up for the podcast
[02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:08.680]  Alright, alright, alright
[02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:10.680]  I think that was a glorious train wreck
[02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:11.680]  I'm not sure what I expected
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:14.680]  When I invited 100 people to join me on a Zoom meeting
[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:17.680]  I'm not sure that if I expected 25 of them to show up
[02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:18.680]  But I am grateful that they did
[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:19.680]  I think I had a good time
[02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:20.680]  I think I handled it well
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:22.680]  That was the first time I've ever hosted a Zoom meeting
[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:24.680]  With approximately 25 people
[02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:25.680]  So I had a good time
[02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:26.680]  I learned a lot
[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:28.680]  I will be doing things kind of like that in the future
[02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:29.680]  Maybe not with that many
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:31.680]  That is kind of a circus with that many people
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:34.680]  But I will be doing more things with more Zoom guests
[02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:36.680]  Now that I've had some practice and gotten better at it
[02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:39.680]  I want to send a big thank you to each and every person
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:41.680]  Who stopped into that Zoom meeting
[02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:44.680]  If you were there for 30 seconds or 2 1⁄2 or 4 hours
[02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:45.680]  Thank you
[02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:48.680]  I do appreciate all of the love, the support, the participation
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:51.680]  Without each and every member of the IRE Army
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:52.680]  It would not be what it is
[02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:55.680]  You all fill your own role, your own position, your own spot
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:56.680]  I need every one of you
[02:24:56.680 --> 02:24:57.680]  We all appreciate you
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:24:58.680]  Thank you
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:00.680]  Big salute to everybody who popped in
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:03.680]  Also, thanks to everybody who has watched this far
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:05.680]  This has been an extremely long podcast
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:07.680]  With very little grow knowledge
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:09.680]  And a lot of just rambles and hanging out
