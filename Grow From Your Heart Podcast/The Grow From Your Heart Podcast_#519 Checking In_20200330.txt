[00:42.520 --> 00:45.880]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what we're smoking.
[00:45.880 --> 00:51.400]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Malibu Pure Kush Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[00:51.400 --> 00:59.840]  On the package, it says this product contains 72.9% THC and 87.4% total cannabinoids.
[00:59.840 --> 01:04.640]  When I crack open the jar, it smells just like a really good kush.
[01:04.640 --> 01:07.240]  If you're familiar with kush, that is what this smells like.
[01:07.240 --> 01:09.500]  It's kush with a little bit of sweetness.
[01:09.500 --> 01:13.080]  If you're not familiar with the kush aroma, it is a hint of gas.
[01:13.080 --> 01:14.680]  There's some skunkiness to it.
[01:14.680 --> 01:18.980]  There's a little bit of feet in there, and there's an overall funky aroma, and I completely
[01:18.980 --> 01:19.980]  enjoy it.
[01:19.980 --> 01:27.060]  Big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious Malibu Pure Kush Ambrosia.
[01:27.060 --> 01:30.320]  This is the point of the show where I generally do shout outs to the friends who support the
[01:30.320 --> 01:35.040]  show on Patreon, but before I do that, I feel like I've got one more thing to talk about.
[01:35.040 --> 01:38.280]  I may sound like I'm a little bit not enthusiastic today.
[01:38.280 --> 01:39.560]  I sound a little bummed out.
[01:39.560 --> 01:41.240]  I am a little bit bummed out.
[01:41.240 --> 01:43.120]  I've got bad news.
[01:43.120 --> 01:45.800]  Another one of my uncles passed away today.
[01:45.800 --> 01:47.040]  It's heartbreaking.
[01:47.860 --> 01:49.980]  I wasn't raised with a dad around.
[01:49.980 --> 01:53.780]  My uncles filled that role, so I've got a lot of love and respect for my uncles and
[01:53.780 --> 01:54.780]  of course my grandpa.
[01:54.780 --> 01:58.020]  My grandfather filled in a big part of that father role.
[01:58.020 --> 02:01.580]  I had three uncles that all teamed up and filled that father role for me.
[02:01.580 --> 02:04.700]  Two of them have passed away in the past three months.
[02:04.700 --> 02:10.620]  It's been a hard day, but I can't sit here and cry about another uncle being passed.
[02:10.620 --> 02:11.940]  He would want me to do my job.
[02:11.940 --> 02:15.460]  He'd want me to get on the microphone and put out some love to you guys.
[02:15.460 --> 02:16.460]  That's what I'm going to do.
[02:16.960 --> 02:20.840]  If I sound a little shaky or if I take a couple of breaks, I apologize.
[02:20.840 --> 02:23.080]  Fucking missing my uncles, dude.
[02:23.080 --> 02:27.200]  If you guys listened to the other episode I did right around Christmas time, I talk
[02:27.200 --> 02:29.720]  about my other uncle who passed away.
[02:29.720 --> 02:34.760]  In that episode, I tell a story of two of my uncles being in a Chevy El Camino, driving
[02:34.760 --> 02:35.760]  me to a concert.
[02:35.760 --> 02:37.660]  I was in the back of the El Camino.
[02:37.660 --> 02:39.080]  It had a camper shell.
[02:39.080 --> 02:40.600]  They smoked the joint up front.
[02:40.600 --> 02:44.160]  All the smoke from their joint ended up in the back of that El Camino with me in the
[02:44.160 --> 02:45.200]  camper shell.
[02:45.220 --> 02:49.380]  I was stoned as fuck, and they took me to my first concert.
[02:49.380 --> 02:51.260]  It was an amazing experience.
[02:51.260 --> 02:55.340]  They played Metallica's The Black Album on that trip.
[02:55.340 --> 02:57.300]  That is why I am a drummer.
[02:57.300 --> 03:01.340]  Those two guys are a lot of why I am who I am and what I am.
[03:01.340 --> 03:05.580]  I got a lot of my sense of humor and my smart-ass personality from my uncles.
[03:05.580 --> 03:08.100]  I got a lot of my playfulness from my uncles.
[03:08.100 --> 03:09.620]  That came from those guys.
[03:09.620 --> 03:11.300]  Also that came from my gramps.
[03:11.300 --> 03:16.520]  A lot of my rebellious personality and my rebellious attitude came from my uncles.
[03:16.520 --> 03:22.240]  The uncle that passed away today was the other dude that was in that El Camino with my uncle
[03:22.240 --> 03:24.800]  Eric on the way to that concert.
[03:24.800 --> 03:25.800]  Those two dudes were around.
[03:25.800 --> 03:27.960]  They were really influential in my life.
[03:27.960 --> 03:29.160]  Today is going to be a little bit weird.
[03:29.160 --> 03:31.120]  The next couple of days will be weird.
[03:31.120 --> 03:33.280]  I assure you that I will be okay.
[03:33.280 --> 03:37.720]  Thank you for all of the messages, all the emails, all the Instagram messages, all the
[03:37.720 --> 03:39.320]  text messages that will come from this.
[03:39.320 --> 03:40.920]  I appreciate you guys.
[03:40.940 --> 03:42.180]  Thank you for all the support.
[03:42.180 --> 03:43.180]  I love you back.
[03:43.180 --> 03:48.100]  Now, I know my uncles would not want me to sit around and cry and have a sad day over
[03:48.100 --> 03:49.100]  them.
[03:49.100 --> 03:51.780]  They would say, go smoke a joint and do what you got to do, bro.
[03:51.780 --> 03:52.780]  That's what we're going to do.
[03:52.780 --> 03:53.780]  I took a couple of dabs.
[03:53.780 --> 03:56.260]  I sat around for a minute and thought about life.
[03:56.260 --> 04:00.780]  Now it is time to get my shit together and do a podcast for all of my friends.
[04:00.780 --> 04:02.500]  It is quarantine time.
[04:02.500 --> 04:03.500]  Everybody's locked down.
[04:03.500 --> 04:06.300]  You guys are relying on me for quality content.
[04:06.300 --> 04:09.260]  Let's get the show on the road.
[04:09.280 --> 04:13.280]  This is the part of the show where I give shout outs to a few of the folks who support
[04:13.280 --> 04:16.360]  the podcast via Patreon.
[04:16.360 --> 04:18.600]  Let's start off by rolling a big fat joint.
[04:18.600 --> 04:22.400]  Let's light that fucker up and pass that over to my buddy Rue Lighting Tim.
[04:22.400 --> 04:26.480]  Then let's roll up another fat joint, light that bitch up and pass it over to my buddy
[04:26.480 --> 04:27.480]  Keith K.
[04:27.480 --> 04:31.660]  I want to pack a big fat dab for my buddy Nick dude.
[04:31.660 --> 04:36.000]  Let's load up the bong with some sticky green herb from my buddy Learnin' and Burnin'.
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.240]  Let's send a big fat fresh bowl over to my buddy Blackbird76.
[04:40.240 --> 04:45.060]  Let's roll up a big fat blunt and fill it up with some rosin from my buddy Big Toe Grows.
[04:45.060 --> 04:48.780]  Let's roll up a big fat joint and wrap a snake of shatter around that one.
[04:48.780 --> 04:51.680]  Let's just put some shatter right around the outside of a joint.
[04:51.680 --> 04:54.680]  Let's pass that fucker over to my buddy Zoso J.
[04:54.680 --> 04:58.280]  Then I want to pack a fresh bong load and put some keef on top of it.
[04:58.280 --> 05:00.800]  We'll light that one up for my buddy Kes Burton.
[05:00.800 --> 05:05.840]  Let's roll a big ridiculous joint and dip it in keef for my buddy Victor.
[05:05.840 --> 05:09.920]  Then let's get crazy and bake a big batch of super potent edibles and pass those over
[05:09.920 --> 05:11.440]  to my buddy Steve F.
[05:11.440 --> 05:16.520]  Then last but certainly not least, I want to roll up a big Cheech and Chong sized joint.
[05:16.520 --> 05:18.960]  I want to put a bunch of shatter down the middle of it.
[05:18.960 --> 05:22.920]  We're going to light that bitch up and we're going to pass it over to my buddy Grim Bull
[05:22.920 --> 05:24.080]  the Druid.
[05:24.080 --> 05:29.840]  Big thanks, big shout out, big fat dab to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.

[05:38.600 --> 05:41.920]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[05:41.920 --> 05:47.000]  I did include a link in the show notes to make it easy for all of my stoned friends.
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.520]  All right, you guys, I feel like I've got my head back in the game.
[05:50.520 --> 05:53.200]  Let's deliver a quality podcast.
[05:53.200 --> 05:58.360]  Let's start off by saying thank you to all of the people who sent me a response to episode
[05:58.360 --> 05:59.360]  518.
[05:59.360 --> 06:04.280]  518 was six years of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[06:04.280 --> 06:06.040]  I got a lot of wonderful emails.
[06:06.040 --> 06:12.000]  I got a lot of Instagram messages and YouTube got so many wonderful comments.
[06:12.000 --> 06:13.000]  Thank you guys.
[06:13.000 --> 06:14.040]  Thank you for all of the support.
[06:14.040 --> 06:15.160]  Thank you for all of the love.
[06:15.160 --> 06:16.960]  Thank you for all of the interaction.
[06:16.960 --> 06:21.840]  Not only does that stuff help me stay energized for the podcast, but in times like these,
[06:21.840 --> 06:26.000]  when I've got family emergencies and family tragedies, that stuff really helps me keep
[06:26.000 --> 06:27.000]  my head up.
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.040]  I've got so many friends out there.
[06:29.040 --> 06:33.240]  I've got countless friends and internet homies and grow buddies.
[06:33.240 --> 06:34.240]  It is amazing.
[06:34.240 --> 06:35.240]  Thank you.
[06:35.240 --> 06:36.240]  I love you guys.
[06:36.240 --> 06:37.720]  Thank you for all the support on the podcast.
[06:37.720 --> 06:42.600]  All right, the next note I have written down says stay at home orders.
[06:42.600 --> 06:45.460]  Just a couple of nights ago, I got a text message on my phone.
[06:45.460 --> 06:49.520]  It was more like an Amber Alert type of a service, an emergency service alert.
[06:49.520 --> 06:53.840]  It said that Colorado has been issued a stay at home order.
[06:53.840 --> 06:57.440]  Basically, the entire state is grounded.
[06:57.440 --> 07:02.400]  Unless you are doing essential activities or your job is considered an essential job,
[07:02.400 --> 07:05.520]  you are ordered to stay at home.
[07:05.520 --> 07:10.880]  Unless you are going to work or grocery shopping or going to the dispensary or the liquor store,
[07:10.880 --> 07:13.080]  you have been asked to stay at home.
[07:13.080 --> 07:17.840]  The times that we are allowed to travel to the stores and the liquor stores and dispensaries
[07:17.840 --> 07:22.000]  have been limited basically to normal business hours.
[07:22.160 --> 07:25.800]  If you are out after those hours, there is a good chance you will be pulled over and
[07:25.800 --> 07:30.200]  you were supposed to present a letter from your employer or some type of document that
[07:30.200 --> 07:34.320]  shows you can be out because you are traveling to and from work.
[07:34.320 --> 07:36.760]  It is a really strange time we're living in.
[07:36.760 --> 07:41.840]  I have very mixed emotions about this restriction, about travel restrictions.
[07:41.840 --> 07:46.680]  The rebellious Rastafarian in me, the rebellious teenager in me, the rebellious human in me
[07:46.680 --> 07:49.240]  says, they say I can't go outside.
[07:49.240 --> 07:50.240]  Fuck them.
[07:50.240 --> 07:51.400]  I really want to go outside and do things.
[07:51.400 --> 07:52.400]  I really do want to go outside.
[07:52.400 --> 07:54.600]  You guys, I've been stuck inside for a few days.
[07:54.600 --> 07:58.160]  I'd love to just go somewhere where there are more people and just high five a few of
[07:58.160 --> 08:00.440]  my friends and say, what's up, bro, and just do that thing.
[08:00.440 --> 08:01.440]  But I know better.
[08:01.440 --> 08:03.420]  That's why I've got mixed emotions about this.
[08:03.420 --> 08:08.080]  If we go outside, we're going to keep passing this virus around like a volleyball.
[08:08.080 --> 08:11.080]  If we go inside, there's nobody to volley the ball around.
[08:11.080 --> 08:12.120]  I've got mixed emotions.
[08:12.120 --> 08:16.520]  I don't like being told, stay the fuck inside, but I also don't like getting sick and I don't
[08:16.520 --> 08:19.280]  like watching people around me get sick.
[08:19.280 --> 08:23.400]  We're on these stay at home orders and it is very strange.
[08:23.400 --> 08:24.400]  It is very quiet.
[08:24.400 --> 08:28.120]  It is so quiet at night that I have a hard time sleeping.
[08:28.120 --> 08:32.800]  I have to turn on movies or a TV in another room and have some sort of chaos going just
[08:32.800 --> 08:33.880]  so I can sleep.
[08:33.880 --> 08:38.120]  Maybe that's some sort of sign about who I am, but when it's too peaceful, my brain and
[08:38.120 --> 08:39.200]  body will not sleep.
[08:39.200 --> 08:42.880]  I grew up in a very loud neighborhood, a very loud area.
[08:42.880 --> 08:44.640]  My area now is kind of loud.
[08:44.640 --> 08:48.260]  It's not super bad, but I'm one or three blocks away from the main street.
[08:48.260 --> 08:52.060]  So there's noise lately, no noise, and it is fucking creepy.
[08:52.060 --> 08:55.700]  It's like a scary movie that has been creepy.
[08:55.700 --> 08:56.700]  Let's see.
[08:56.700 --> 09:00.620]  I mentioned essential businesses and I said, unless you are going to the grocery store
[09:00.620 --> 09:05.780]  to get groceries or you're going to the liquor store or the dispensary, you've been requested
[09:05.780 --> 09:06.780]  to stay home.
[09:06.780 --> 09:08.220]  There are a few other cases you can travel to.
[09:08.220 --> 09:11.860]  You can go to the hospital or the doctor, or if you need prescriptions, you can do that
[09:11.860 --> 09:14.860]  stuff, but it's very limited travel right now.
[09:14.860 --> 09:21.100]  The amazing and interesting part is the state of Colorado has deemed medical and recreational
[09:21.100 --> 09:24.340]  cannabis as essential business.
[09:24.340 --> 09:30.180]  So until further notice, we are still able to purchase medical and recreational cannabis
[09:30.180 --> 09:35.540]  concentrates, edibles, topicals, all of the other things that were available at the dispensary
[09:35.540 --> 09:38.460]  are still available at this time.
[09:38.460 --> 09:41.380]  There are a few different protocols in place.
[09:41.380 --> 09:46.820]  If you are shopping at a medical marijuana dispensary in the state of Colorado during
[09:46.820 --> 09:52.500]  this weird COVID-19 quarantine lockdown period at a medical dispensary, you are still allowed
[09:52.500 --> 09:54.460]  to go into the store.
[09:54.460 --> 09:58.780]  You are allowed to walk in the store, but you are kept about seven or eight feet away
[09:58.780 --> 10:00.980]  from any people that work in the store.
[10:00.980 --> 10:02.780]  You're not allowed to touch anything.
[10:02.780 --> 10:06.540]  You're not allowed to really put too much of a visual look on the product.
[10:06.540 --> 10:10.940]  They ask you to set your money on the counter and then they push it into the cash register
[10:11.020 --> 10:12.020]  with their gloved hands.
[10:12.020 --> 10:13.460]  They don't even really touch it.
[10:13.460 --> 10:14.820]  They don't want any interaction.
[10:14.820 --> 10:18.380]  They put your product at the very end of the counter in a bag and they basically ask you
[10:18.380 --> 10:21.140]  to get the fuck out in a real polite way.
[10:21.140 --> 10:22.140]  It is effective.
[10:22.140 --> 10:23.200]  It's efficient shopping.
[10:23.200 --> 10:24.500]  It's uncomfortable.
[10:24.500 --> 10:29.460]  Everybody in there is decked out in like Tyvek suits and scrubs and face masks and goggles
[10:29.460 --> 10:31.020]  and gloves and shit.
[10:31.020 --> 10:34.060]  It looks like you're buying drugs from aliens or something like that.
[10:34.060 --> 10:39.180]  It's a little bit weird, but the medicine is still available and I find that to be a
[10:39.180 --> 10:40.180]  blessing.
[10:40.180 --> 10:42.100]  I find that to be very progressive.
[10:42.100 --> 10:46.520]  I think that is amazing that people can still get their medical cannabis during this sort
[10:46.520 --> 10:47.520]  of a time.
[10:47.520 --> 10:53.140]  Also, the recreational dispensaries are still open, but they are now offering curb side
[10:53.140 --> 10:54.140]  service.
[10:54.140 --> 10:55.600]  That is a very new thing.
[10:55.600 --> 11:00.300]  That is something Colorado did not want in the beginning of the cannabis revolution,
[11:00.300 --> 11:04.940]  but in these times we have adjusted to the curb side service.
[11:04.940 --> 11:09.020]  So what you need to do in most places is contact the dispensary where you're shopping.
[11:09.020 --> 11:13.820]  If it's via the phone, via an online ordering service, you give them a heads up, you drive
[11:13.820 --> 11:17.860]  through the parking lot 15 to 30 minutes later, you've already identified your vehicle and
[11:17.860 --> 11:19.260]  your license plate number.
[11:19.260 --> 11:23.500]  They come out, they make sure that you're 21 and if you're 21, they take your money,
[11:23.500 --> 11:26.600]  they give you your order, they run back into the store, they make change out of the money
[11:26.600 --> 11:30.240]  you gave them, they came back and give you your change and you're all set to go with
[11:30.240 --> 11:32.460]  your recreational cannabis.
[11:32.460 --> 11:33.900]  Some people were confused.
[11:33.900 --> 11:38.940]  There was a question if you could sell recreational cannabis to a 21 year old adult.
[11:38.980 --> 11:44.060]  If they had people under 21 in the car and it was deemed sell the cannabis, as long as
[11:44.060 --> 11:47.220]  there is somebody 21 in there, that is the pass.
[11:47.220 --> 11:50.260]  That's the ticket that says, yes, you can do this, fucking do it.
[11:50.260 --> 11:52.340]  Give them the herb, let them have their day.
[11:52.340 --> 11:53.340]  Don't make it difficult.
[11:53.340 --> 11:56.180]  We've got to make things easy for people in this time.
[11:56.180 --> 12:01.740]  I really find it to be a blessing that the state of Colorado has deemed cannabis as an
[12:01.740 --> 12:03.600]  essential service.
[12:03.600 --> 12:04.860]  That is amazing to me.
[12:04.860 --> 12:10.260]  I also appreciate it because many of my friends work in the cannabis industry and without
[12:10.260 --> 12:14.300]  that being open, more of my friends would be without jobs.
[12:14.300 --> 12:19.340]  So I'm excited that at least a few of my friends have gotten to remain employed.
[12:19.340 --> 12:22.660]  Now I also mentioned that the liquor stores are open.
[12:22.660 --> 12:24.920]  Many people may say, why is the liquor store open?
[12:24.920 --> 12:26.260]  That is not a medicinal need.
[12:26.260 --> 12:32.220]  Well, I agree that there are several reasons why we should keep liquor stores open.
[12:32.220 --> 12:35.160]  The first reason I agree is I like to smoke cannabis.
[12:35.160 --> 12:36.860]  That is my choice.
[12:36.860 --> 12:38.220]  I'm going to say drug of choice.
[12:38.220 --> 12:39.500]  It's my thing of choice.
[12:39.500 --> 12:40.980]  I used to drink alcohol.
[12:40.980 --> 12:43.300]  It made me act like a complete asshole.
[12:43.300 --> 12:46.300]  I know plenty of people that can drink and behave themselves.
[12:46.300 --> 12:50.140]  I know plenty of people that smoke cannabis and turn into fucking dipshits.
[12:50.140 --> 12:51.720]  So we do what we enjoy.
[12:51.720 --> 12:53.700]  If you like cookies, you like cookies.
[12:53.700 --> 12:55.340]  If you like cannabis, you like cannabis.
[12:55.340 --> 12:58.220]  If you like alcohol, you like alcohol.
[12:58.220 --> 13:01.460]  Everybody turns to something in this type of a situation.
[13:01.460 --> 13:02.820]  It might be the TV.
[13:02.820 --> 13:04.180]  It could be video games.
[13:04.180 --> 13:05.380]  It could be books.
[13:05.380 --> 13:06.960]  We all choose something.
[13:06.960 --> 13:08.340]  We can't be judgmental.
[13:08.340 --> 13:10.260]  I choose a lot of cannabis.
[13:10.260 --> 13:11.900]  I dab a lot.
[13:11.900 --> 13:13.580]  Some people choose alcohol.
[13:13.580 --> 13:18.700]  I am glad that there is something like that open for some sort of a, we were calling it
[13:18.700 --> 13:20.500]  a pressure release valve.
[13:20.500 --> 13:21.860]  We're stuck at home.
[13:21.860 --> 13:25.960]  Many of us may be stuck with people we don't really want to be stuck with.
[13:25.960 --> 13:29.860]  Many of us, maybe you want to be stuck with them for two or three days, but we're going
[13:29.860 --> 13:33.220]  on over a week now where we've been stuck in a home with these people.
[13:33.220 --> 13:35.620]  And you may just want to choke a motherfucker out.
[13:35.620 --> 13:38.720]  If you've got a little pressure release valve, you may feel better.
[13:38.720 --> 13:41.220]  Maybe you guys can drink a couple of drinks and laugh it off.
[13:41.220 --> 13:43.620]  Maybe you can put on some Netflix and giggle it out.
[13:43.620 --> 13:46.560]  Maybe you could take a few dabs and laugh it off.
[13:46.560 --> 13:49.940]  Maybe other people eat a bunch of fucking cookies and just chow down.
[13:49.940 --> 13:51.420]  And that's how people deal with things.
[13:51.420 --> 13:52.740]  We've all got our own approach.
[13:52.740 --> 13:57.220]  So I think it's wonderful that they have kept the dispensaries open and the liquor stores.
[13:57.220 --> 13:59.860]  Many people argued liquor stores were not essential.
[13:59.860 --> 14:03.340]  In times like these, any sort of an escape is essential.
[14:03.340 --> 14:08.820]  And also, if you take an alcoholic and you make him dry out involuntarily, it is going
[14:08.820 --> 14:10.340]  to cause emotional problems.
[14:10.340 --> 14:12.100]  It could cause physical problems.
[14:12.100 --> 14:14.140]  It could cause medical problems.
[14:14.140 --> 14:19.380]  Those people will have more problems trying to sober up in this fucking stressful environment
[14:19.380 --> 14:20.760]  if you force it on them.
[14:20.760 --> 14:23.020]  So let's just let them have their drinks.
[14:23.020 --> 14:26.460]  And I'm sure that there are some people out there that if we cut off their alcohol right
[14:26.500 --> 14:29.420]  now, cold turkey, they'll go into withdrawals.
[14:29.420 --> 14:30.420]  They'll have seizures.
[14:30.420 --> 14:31.420]  They'll have problems.
[14:31.420 --> 14:32.780]  We don't want to do that to people.
[14:32.780 --> 14:35.260]  So we need to keep essential services open.
[14:35.260 --> 14:40.980]  And I am proud and excited that we are progressive enough here in my state to have recreational
[14:40.980 --> 14:44.460]  and medical dispensaries as well as liquor stores open.
[14:44.460 --> 14:45.540]  And I'm not a drinker.
[14:45.540 --> 14:50.020]  So I'm being really open-minded and accepting that the liquor stores are open.
[14:50.020 --> 14:51.740]  Everybody else has their own shit.
[14:51.740 --> 14:54.580]  All of the video game players, they're at home just killing it.
[14:54.700 --> 14:57.020]  They're like, oh, you mean I can't go to work for two weeks?
[14:57.020 --> 14:59.860]  Watch me level up on every fucking game I've ever bought.
[14:59.860 --> 15:01.300]  So they're having a good old time.
[15:01.300 --> 15:04.780]  All the musicians, they're like, oh, now's the time to go learn that rush tune I couldn't
[15:04.780 --> 15:05.780]  figure out.
[15:05.780 --> 15:07.020]  Everybody's doing their own thing.
[15:07.020 --> 15:10.740]  We've all got our own, if you want to call it an addiction or an outlet, we're all doing
[15:10.740 --> 15:11.740]  that.
[15:11.740 --> 15:15.300]  So I think it's great that they've kept some of our outlets open for us.
[15:15.300 --> 15:20.900]  Now with that being said, I am still trying to ration my concentrates to an acceptable
[15:20.900 --> 15:21.900]  level.
[15:21.900 --> 15:26.140]  I'm trying not to panic shop and panic buy concentrates when I go to the store, but my
[15:26.140 --> 15:28.180]  shopping routine has been disrupted.
[15:28.180 --> 15:29.180]  It's not normal.
[15:29.180 --> 15:30.180]  It's not regular.
[15:30.180 --> 15:31.420]  There are extra steps.
[15:31.420 --> 15:34.540]  I feel like everybody out there is carrying the plague now.
[15:34.540 --> 15:35.540]  Nothing personal.
[15:35.540 --> 15:38.300]  I just feel like if I'm near you, you're going to get me sick.
[15:38.300 --> 15:41.940]  So I'm trying not to go to the dispensary any more than necessary.
[15:41.940 --> 15:45.580]  I've gone a couple of times and stocked up a little bit, trying not to clean them out
[15:45.580 --> 15:49.860]  of anything, but I got enough to last me what I think will get me through a week or two,
[15:49.860 --> 15:53.900]  but I'm still trying to ration it because I don't want to go too crazy and smoke all
[15:53.900 --> 15:58.140]  of my concentrates and have to go out there and face the dispensary line.
[15:58.140 --> 15:59.620]  I think I've got enough groceries.
[15:59.620 --> 16:01.460]  I think I've got enough concentrates.
[16:01.460 --> 16:02.580]  I've got butane.
[16:02.580 --> 16:04.660]  I've actually got the e-nails sitting on the table.
[16:04.660 --> 16:06.420]  I don't use the e-nail very often.
[16:06.420 --> 16:11.100]  Big shout out to my friends at B Nails for the B nail, the rig and the ceramic nail.
[16:11.100 --> 16:12.620]  This is a great setup.
[16:12.620 --> 16:14.720]  Big shout out to Ali over at B Nails.
[16:14.720 --> 16:16.820]  Thank you for all of the support, dude.
[16:16.820 --> 16:18.940]  Great people over there at B Nails support them.
[16:18.940 --> 16:22.620]  I am trying to be prepared for whatever comes ahead.
[16:22.620 --> 16:26.180]  They may decide that we've got to stay on lockdown even longer.
[16:26.180 --> 16:30.540]  So I'm trying to be prepared, trying to think forward, trying to make the best of it.
[16:30.540 --> 16:35.020]  Also I have gotten so much shit cleaned up while we're on this little quarantine, while
[16:35.020 --> 16:37.620]  we're on strike or while we're on restriction.
[16:37.620 --> 16:42.420]  I've been cleaning up all the random shit in my house or in my grows or in my spaces.
[16:42.420 --> 16:45.420]  I'm like, Oh, there's that little mess that I've been looking at going one day, I'm going
[16:45.420 --> 16:46.420]  to do that.
[16:46.420 --> 16:49.020]  It has been one day for the past couple of days here.
[16:49.020 --> 16:50.660]  I've been getting a lot of shit done.
[16:50.660 --> 16:52.140]  That feels kind of nice.
[16:52.140 --> 16:53.340]  What are you guys catching up on?
[16:53.340 --> 16:56.900]  Are you doing anything with this time or are you one of those guys that's just beating
[16:56.900 --> 16:58.960]  every video game on the planet right now?
[16:58.960 --> 17:00.260]  Are you scrolling on Facebook?
[17:00.260 --> 17:02.160]  Are you shit posting on Instagram?
[17:02.160 --> 17:04.620]  How are you taking advantage of this time off?
[17:04.620 --> 17:06.460]  We've all got to be stuck at home.
[17:06.460 --> 17:10.140]  Maybe you're lucky enough to still be employed and get to go to work.
[17:10.140 --> 17:11.140]  Don't complain right now.
[17:11.140 --> 17:14.900]  If you are required to go to work, be excited because in a couple of months, you'll be one
[17:14.900 --> 17:17.020]  of the only people getting paychecks.
[17:17.020 --> 17:19.120]  There are a lot of people out there going to be fucked.
[17:19.120 --> 17:21.060]  So try to be grateful for that part.
[17:21.060 --> 17:22.980]  But what are you doing with this time?
[17:22.980 --> 17:24.580]  You've got a lot of time to spend.
[17:24.580 --> 17:26.180]  Are you hanging out with your family?
[17:26.180 --> 17:27.360]  Don't go other places.
[17:27.360 --> 17:29.860]  I'm going to take a moment and be that guy.
[17:29.860 --> 17:32.100]  Let's take these stay at home orders seriously.
[17:32.100 --> 17:34.100]  Quit going and infecting other people.
[17:34.100 --> 17:35.220]  Stay at home.
[17:35.220 --> 17:37.800]  If you live with other people, that is your crew now.
[17:37.800 --> 17:38.800]  That's your gang.
[17:38.800 --> 17:40.080]  Lock in, live with them.
[17:40.080 --> 17:41.460]  No more people in and out.
[17:41.460 --> 17:43.100]  You're not going anywhere.
[17:43.100 --> 17:44.100]  Stop it.
[17:44.300 --> 17:45.940]  I said it a minute ago.
[17:45.940 --> 17:48.060]  This virus is like a volleyball.
[17:48.060 --> 17:51.800]  And right now, whoever is out there, they're batting the volleyball around.
[17:51.800 --> 17:52.980]  They're a bunch of volleyballs.
[17:52.980 --> 17:54.980]  They're all fucking flying all over the place.
[17:54.980 --> 17:57.040]  There's a couple of people just keeping them in the air.
[17:57.040 --> 17:59.900]  All the people that went inside were not playing volleyball.
[17:59.900 --> 18:00.900]  We've given up.
[18:00.900 --> 18:03.100]  So all those balls were not smacking back in the air.
[18:03.100 --> 18:04.780]  They're landing and they're dying.
[18:04.780 --> 18:07.900]  All the people out there smacking them around, they're keeping the volleyballs going.
[18:07.900 --> 18:08.900]  That's the virus.
[18:08.900 --> 18:09.900]  They're just passing it around.
[18:09.900 --> 18:13.220]  If they would go the fuck inside, the volleyballs would quit getting volleyed.
[18:13.340 --> 18:15.000]  The virus would quit spreading around.
[18:15.000 --> 18:16.000]  Over time, we could stop.
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.500]  The longer there are people out there fucking around, the longer we have to stay inside
[18:19.500 --> 18:21.540]  and try to keep ourselves safe.
[18:21.540 --> 18:23.140]  So that is my rant.
[18:23.140 --> 18:27.040]  Most people that listen to this are smart enough to realize to take these orders seriously.
[18:27.040 --> 18:28.900]  I said before, I've got mixed emotions on it.
[18:28.900 --> 18:30.580]  I don't like being told what to do.
[18:30.580 --> 18:32.260]  I also don't like dying.
[18:32.260 --> 18:36.620]  I also don't like wondering if I'm carrying a deadly disease that could kill my mom.
[18:36.620 --> 18:39.020]  So you guys, let's take this shit seriously.
[18:39.020 --> 18:40.580]  Let's take ourselves seriously.
[18:40.580 --> 18:41.700]  Let's just take care of each other.
[18:41.700 --> 18:42.700]  All right.
[18:43.180 --> 18:44.180]  I'm super rambly.
[18:44.180 --> 18:45.180]  What are we doing with this time?
[18:45.180 --> 18:46.500]  We've got a lot of time.
[18:46.500 --> 18:48.020]  Spend some time with your family.
[18:48.020 --> 18:49.620]  Spend some time cleaning up some shit.
[18:49.620 --> 18:54.940]  Also, now is a very good time to calibrate and clean all of your equipment.
[18:54.940 --> 18:59.100]  People forget to calibrate their pH meters, their PPM meters.
[18:59.100 --> 19:00.100]  Calibrate all of your shit.
[19:00.100 --> 19:02.620]  If it can be calibrated, why not do it today?
[19:02.620 --> 19:04.700]  You're listening to a podcast, chilling out.
[19:04.700 --> 19:07.140]  Get up, put in an earbud so you can still hear me.
[19:07.140 --> 19:08.300]  Go clean some shit.
[19:08.300 --> 19:09.300]  Go calibrate some shit.
[19:09.300 --> 19:12.520]  If it's got a filter on it, now is the time to clean it.
[19:12.520 --> 19:14.920]  Your air conditioner probably has a filter.
[19:14.920 --> 19:15.920]  Clean it.
[19:15.920 --> 19:18.160]  If you've got any kind of filters, clean them right now.
[19:18.160 --> 19:21.640]  If you are running an auto feed system and you've got one of those filters that hangs
[19:21.640 --> 19:24.920]  at an angle, take that thing out of there and scrub it down real good.
[19:24.920 --> 19:26.540]  Now is the time.
[19:26.540 --> 19:28.480]  Now is a good time to clean your reservoirs.
[19:28.480 --> 19:30.560]  Now is a good time to clean all of your tables.
[19:30.560 --> 19:32.080]  Clean up all the cloners.
[19:32.080 --> 19:33.080]  Clean everything.
[19:33.080 --> 19:38.620]  Also, why not inventory all of your nutrients and reorganize your mixing and storage area?
[19:38.620 --> 19:42.360]  You may be surprised at what you forgot you bought and you keep buying a replacement because
[19:42.400 --> 19:45.680]  one time you bought one and you set it in a stupid spot and you're going to find like
[19:45.680 --> 19:46.680]  a $90 product.
[19:46.680 --> 19:48.720]  You're going to go, oh shit, I kept buying that.
[19:48.720 --> 19:53.280]  But you've got the exact product sitting right there on the shelf or sitting underneath something
[19:53.280 --> 19:54.800]  or maybe behind something.
[19:54.800 --> 19:59.000]  Trust me, I'm speaking from experience because just a few days ago, I drove to the grocery
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.680]  store for one specific product.
[20:00.680 --> 20:04.200]  I ended up buying a bunch of products while I was there because that's how I shop.
[20:04.200 --> 20:05.200]  Why not get more shit?
[20:05.200 --> 20:06.400]  Then I got home.
[20:06.400 --> 20:07.720]  I was unloading all of my shit.
[20:07.720 --> 20:11.720]  I cleaned up a shelf and on the bottom shelf, right underneath some other stuff was the
[20:11.720 --> 20:14.400]  product that I had originally gone to the store for.
[20:14.400 --> 20:18.840]  It ended up costing me a couple of hundred bucks just because all the impulse shopping.
[20:18.840 --> 20:21.840]  So my point after a long ramble is clean your shit up.
[20:21.840 --> 20:22.920]  We've got a bunch of time.
[20:22.920 --> 20:24.680]  Why not clean some shit up?
[20:24.680 --> 20:27.160]  If you've got some dead leaves in the room, clean those up.
[20:27.160 --> 20:30.160]  If you've got some soil you spilled somewhere, clean that shit up.
[20:30.160 --> 20:33.840]  If you've got some trash that needs to go out, now's the time to get rid of all that
[20:33.840 --> 20:35.080]  bullshit.
[20:35.080 --> 20:39.160]  One thing I'm going to mention is make sure you have got all of the supplies you need
[20:39.160 --> 20:41.000]  for the next few weeks.
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.760]  And also if you decide to do any upgrades or while you're cleaning, if you decide to
[20:44.760 --> 20:49.600]  improve anything, make sure you've got the shit you need before you start creating a
[20:49.600 --> 20:50.600]  project.
[20:50.600 --> 20:53.360]  We may be on limited shopping and limited supplies right now.
[20:53.360 --> 20:55.760]  I don't know if your grocery store is open.
[20:55.760 --> 21:02.200]  Here in Colorado, we are very lucky because agriculture has been deemed an essential business.
[21:02.200 --> 21:05.000]  So many of the larger grocery stores are still open.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.240]  Some of the mom and pop shops aren't open.
[21:07.240 --> 21:11.280]  If you need some emergency stuff, you may be able to get it at the big box stores, at
[21:11.280 --> 21:12.280]  the big grocery shops.
[21:12.280 --> 21:13.840]  They may have what you need.
[21:13.840 --> 21:18.040]  But think about that before you go doing a project or cleaning some shit up or doing
[21:18.040 --> 21:22.600]  anything that may need replaced or don't break anything right now, please, because you may
[21:22.600 --> 21:24.680]  be limited on what's available.
[21:24.680 --> 21:27.160]  A lot of stuff online is sold out.
[21:27.160 --> 21:29.360]  A lot of stuff is on limited shipping.
[21:29.360 --> 21:32.520]  Amazon is trying to keep up, but they are overloaded right now.
[21:32.520 --> 21:34.700]  They can't get packages out quickly enough.
[21:34.700 --> 21:37.660]  It may take longer to get the shit that we need.
[21:37.660 --> 21:39.740]  So let's be prepared for that sort of stuff.
[21:39.740 --> 21:41.740]  I am actually rationing drumsticks.
[21:41.740 --> 21:43.260]  I know that sounds crazy.
[21:43.260 --> 21:47.060]  What I am doing with some of this time is I've been playing the shit out of my drums.
[21:47.060 --> 21:50.740]  If you listen to the show a lot, you know that one of my other passions is music and
[21:50.740 --> 21:52.020]  playing the drums.
[21:52.020 --> 21:55.660]  I've played the drums for over 25 years at this point.
[21:55.660 --> 21:58.420]  I feel like I've got a pretty good grasp of what I'm doing.
[21:58.420 --> 21:59.780]  I am a loud drummer.
[21:59.780 --> 22:02.020]  I smack the shit out of my drums.
[22:02.020 --> 22:07.660]  I am breaking about a stick every three days at this rate, maybe two sticks every week,
[22:07.660 --> 22:11.780]  which is not going to sustain me if we are locked down for too much longer.
[22:11.780 --> 22:16.180]  So I've got to mellow down and quit being a beaver and quit breaking the fucking sticks,
[22:16.180 --> 22:19.980]  or I'll be out there using fucking bamboo from the grow trying to rock out like I'm
[22:19.980 --> 22:20.980]  John Bonham.
[22:20.980 --> 22:22.100]  You guys, I'm rambly.
[22:22.100 --> 22:24.280]  I got super high before this episode.
[22:24.280 --> 22:26.580]  Thank you for being very therapeutic for me.
[22:26.580 --> 22:28.180]  I like hanging out with you guys.
[22:28.180 --> 22:29.540]  Recording feels very good to me.
[22:29.540 --> 22:31.040]  It's a good way to let some shit out.
[22:31.040 --> 22:32.260]  So I appreciate that.
[22:32.260 --> 22:33.820]  Thank you for putting up with me.
[22:33.820 --> 22:38.580]  I've got one more thing I want to talk about for this little kind of an impromptu lockdown
[22:38.580 --> 22:39.580]  episode.
[22:39.580 --> 22:42.340]  This is not at all what I had planned for this episode, but I like this.
[22:42.340 --> 22:43.340]  It feels natural.
[22:43.340 --> 22:44.340]  It was fun.
[22:44.340 --> 22:45.340]  It was spontaneous.
[22:45.340 --> 22:48.980]  The next thing I'm going to talk about that we can do while we are locked down is we should
[22:48.980 --> 22:51.820]  be listening to more podcasts.
[22:51.820 --> 22:53.760]  There are so many people out there we can support.
[22:53.760 --> 22:55.900]  So many shows we have not been supporting.
[22:55.900 --> 22:58.260]  So many comedians that need our help right now.
[22:58.260 --> 23:00.660]  So many musicians that need our help right now.
[23:00.660 --> 23:03.020]  Let's go check out some comedians and musicians.
[23:03.020 --> 23:06.400]  And if we can maybe send a buck or two to their patreons.
[23:06.400 --> 23:08.500]  Also discover some new podcasts.
[23:08.500 --> 23:13.300]  If you're looking for another podcast, I would definitely recommend the Dude Grows Show.
[23:13.300 --> 23:16.420]  They gave me a huge shout out on their podcast a couple of days ago.
[23:16.420 --> 23:18.500]  I feel like I should return the favor.
[23:18.500 --> 23:22.260]  Make sure you check out the Dude Grows Show podcast.
[23:22.260 --> 23:23.260]  It's on YouTube.
[23:23.260 --> 23:24.880]  It is on Apple podcasts.
[23:24.880 --> 23:25.880]  It's everywhere.
[23:25.880 --> 23:28.240]  Anywhere a respectable podcast can be found.
[23:28.240 --> 23:31.960]  I'm going to open up my phone and look at my podcast app here just so I can recommend
[23:31.960 --> 23:35.640]  some more cannabis related podcasts for you guys.
[23:35.640 --> 23:42.900]  Also I would always recommend the Cannabis Cultivation and Science by Tad Hussey.
[23:42.900 --> 23:45.920]  That one is a little bit more in depth than my show.
[23:45.920 --> 23:47.540]  It may lose some people.
[23:47.540 --> 23:50.040]  Some people will be blown away by the show.
[23:50.040 --> 23:54.000]  Again that is Cannabis Cultivation and Science by Tad Hussey.
[23:54.120 --> 23:57.080]  I also recommend a show called Shaping Fire.
[23:57.080 --> 23:59.720]  Shaping Fire is a wonderful podcast.
[23:59.720 --> 24:03.240]  Shango Lowe's does a great job hosting that one.
[24:03.240 --> 24:06.960]  Also there is the podcast and of course the Growcast.
[24:06.960 --> 24:09.840]  We cannot forget the Adam Dunn Show.
[24:09.840 --> 24:10.960]  Big shout out to Adam Dunn.
[24:10.960 --> 24:11.960]  He's up in Denver.
[24:11.960 --> 24:14.240]  He gets a lot of great guests on his show.
[24:14.240 --> 24:16.200]  Got to give him some love and respect.
[24:16.200 --> 24:23.200]  Also do not forget about the Bloom Booster Podcast that is hosted by Q Grows from Cannabuzz.
[24:23.920 --> 24:28.720]  I'm going to make sure to recommend another show that I am on almost every other Wednesday
[24:28.720 --> 24:30.040]  during this lockdown time.
[24:30.040 --> 24:31.560]  I've been on there every week.
[24:31.560 --> 24:35.480]  I participate in a show called Embracing Organics on YouTube.
[24:35.480 --> 24:39.400]  We record every Thursday at 7pm Mountain Time.
[24:39.400 --> 24:41.440]  I don't know what time zone you are in.
[24:41.440 --> 24:44.680]  It is 7pm Mountain Time Thursdays.
[24:44.680 --> 24:46.560]  We go for about two hours.
[24:46.560 --> 24:50.980]  Those shows are left up on YouTube so if you don't catch us live you can watch the replays
[24:50.980 --> 24:53.040]  on YouTube at any time.
[24:53.080 --> 24:56.120]  That show is called Embracing Organics.
[24:56.120 --> 24:59.000]  That's a lot of stuff for you guys to listen to during this lockdown.
[24:59.000 --> 25:00.280]  Support my friends.
[25:00.280 --> 25:04.480]  Support the artists that entertain you while you're stuck, while they're stuck.
[25:04.480 --> 25:05.480]  If you can.
[25:05.480 --> 25:07.400]  I understand many people are out of work right now.
[25:07.400 --> 25:12.080]  Many people are struggling just as much as the artists, musicians, and wait staff and
[25:12.080 --> 25:13.440]  service industry.
[25:13.440 --> 25:15.720]  If you can help some people out, send them a buck.
[25:15.720 --> 25:18.960]  If you can help out your favorite comedian, send them a dollar because they don't have
[25:18.960 --> 25:19.960]  any gigs right now.
[25:19.960 --> 25:23.080]  If you can help out your favorite musician, send them a dollar because they don't have
[25:23.080 --> 25:24.520]  any gigs right now.
[25:24.520 --> 25:28.120]  And also listen to and support more podcasting.
[25:28.120 --> 25:29.720]  You guys, I am super rambly.
[25:29.720 --> 25:30.920]  I feel much better.
[25:30.920 --> 25:31.920]  Thank you.
[25:31.920 --> 25:32.920]  This was a great podcast.
[25:32.920 --> 25:36.760]  I guess this one was more for me than you guys but I hope you had a good time too.
[25:36.760 --> 25:38.360]  I'm going to wrap it up here.
[25:38.360 --> 25:41.200]  Big shout out to all of our friends that support the show on Patreon.

[30:21.340 --> 30:24.340]  I want to thank you again for listening.
[30:24.340 --> 30:32.340]  I want to wrap it up by sending a giant shout out to my buddy, Jay Blaze.
[30:32.340 --> 30:38.340]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
