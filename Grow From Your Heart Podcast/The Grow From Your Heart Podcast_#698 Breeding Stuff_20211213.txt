[00:08.320 --> 00:10.680]  All right, here we go.
[00:10.680 --> 00:12.400]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:12.400 --> 00:19.160]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 698 of the Grow From Your
[00:19.160 --> 00:20.780]  Heart podcast.
[00:20.780 --> 00:24.720]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of grow questions before we get to that part
[00:24.720 --> 00:25.780]  of the show.
[00:25.780 --> 00:30.320]  Let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who continue to support the show
[00:30.320 --> 00:31.900]  on Patreon.
[00:31.900 --> 00:35.880]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to Black
[00:35.880 --> 00:36.880]  Hippie.
[00:36.880 --> 00:40.000]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Alabama Man and Jethro Earl.
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.160]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to my buddy 311.
[00:43.160 --> 00:44.880]  Let's send a fist bump to Crazy Hand Grows.
[00:44.880 --> 00:48.260]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Spherical Glassworks.
[00:48.260 --> 00:52.700]  Let's send a big fist bump to a longtime supporter, a good friend, my buddy Gramps Memo.
[00:52.700 --> 00:55.880]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to the Turt Burglar.
[00:55.880 --> 00:58.560]  Let's send a fist bump to Verbal Medicine and Single T.
[00:58.560 --> 01:02.480]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:02.480 --> 01:04.760]  to Brohand78.
[01:04.760 --> 01:09.700]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:09.700 --> 01:13.400]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:13.400 --> 01:19.760]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:19.760 --> 01:23.400]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen and you know I do include a
[01:23.400 --> 01:28.960]  link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends
[01:28.960 --> 01:33.400]  and yes I will put that information in the show notes properly.
[01:33.400 --> 01:36.720]  The show notes properly and correctly this time.
[01:36.720 --> 01:38.040]  I will remember to do that.
[01:38.040 --> 01:41.000]  Thank you for the gentle and subtle reminders.
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.760]  All right where do we go from there?
[01:42.760 --> 01:43.760]  Let's just jump right into it.
[01:43.760 --> 01:45.940]  I've got a message from a previous episode.
[01:45.940 --> 01:49.360]  In the last episode I talked about my strain Grateful Dog.
[01:49.360 --> 01:53.240]  I talked about an offshoot of Grateful Dog that is known as 77.
[01:53.240 --> 01:55.620]  If you listen to the episode you know what I'm talking about.
[01:55.620 --> 01:56.960]  If not give it a listen.
[01:56.960 --> 01:59.640]  It's the episode right before this titled Grateful Dog.
[01:59.640 --> 02:00.760]  You might enjoy it.
[02:00.760 --> 02:02.520]  This question goes like this.
[02:02.520 --> 02:07.340]  It came from our friend Old Ball Coach and it says, can we in the Irie Army expect anything
[02:07.340 --> 02:10.760]  from number 77 in the near future?
[02:10.760 --> 02:11.760]  Thanks for what you do.
[02:11.760 --> 02:12.760]  And then there's more.
[02:12.760 --> 02:16.040]  It says don't read this part in the air so I won't read that part.
[02:16.040 --> 02:17.040]  Thank you for that message.
[02:17.040 --> 02:18.400]  I did read that part to myself.
[02:18.400 --> 02:19.400]  Big respect.
[02:19.400 --> 02:20.400]  Nothing but love.
[02:20.400 --> 02:23.200]  The answer to your question though is quick.
[02:23.200 --> 02:28.520]  I don't have any plans for number 77 for any commercial breeding releases.
[02:28.520 --> 02:32.360]  Sometimes I do make and create projects that kind of stick around and they stay for myself
[02:32.360 --> 02:34.680]  for me to breed with, for me to work with.
[02:34.680 --> 02:40.200]  77 so far has been kept a secret, kept in the private reserve, in the vault if you will.
[02:40.200 --> 02:42.080]  I have to have some things that I don't release.
[02:42.080 --> 02:45.720]  I have to have some things that I can use as breeding stock in the future.
[02:45.720 --> 02:51.120]  If I release everything you've got the potential to recreate everything in my lineup.
[02:51.120 --> 02:54.760]  You could possibly recreate everything that I've put out there if you acquired the right
[02:54.760 --> 02:58.440]  strains, did a little bit of homework, did some research, did some pheno hunting, did
[02:58.440 --> 02:59.520]  some matching.
[02:59.520 --> 03:01.200]  You could make a lot of my line.
[03:01.200 --> 03:04.800]  However, I do have some things that I've bred that I have never put out there.
[03:04.800 --> 03:08.080]  I've got male plants that I've used that I've never put out any of the seeds.
[03:08.080 --> 03:11.640]  I've got female plants I've pollinated that nobody has ever seen those crosses.
[03:11.640 --> 03:15.860]  I've got kind of a secret arsenal, my secret weapons, my hidden vault.
[03:15.860 --> 03:17.180]  Not everything makes it out.
[03:17.180 --> 03:20.840]  So there are some things that have been played with with 77 but nothing that will go out
[03:21.560 --> 03:24.160]  commercially in the foreseeable future.
[03:24.160 --> 03:28.360]  Although the market changes, my ideas change, my opinions change.
[03:28.360 --> 03:31.960]  Sometimes you notice that I realize that some seeds have been sitting in the vault and my
[03:31.960 --> 03:36.680]  secret stash and my private reserve for far too long and I begin to feel guilty about
[03:36.680 --> 03:37.680]  that.
[03:37.680 --> 03:41.040]  I think those need to get out to some friends and I will put those up, make them available
[03:41.040 --> 03:46.320]  for people in certain avenues and certain places, most likely the Discord server.
[03:46.320 --> 03:48.960]  But that is how I end up getting rid of some stuff like that sometimes.
[03:48.960 --> 03:53.760]  So maybe eventually one day I'll decide that I've had some of those number 77 cross to
[03:53.760 --> 03:59.160]  I'm not even going to say what they've been pollinated by or anyway we don't need to talk
[03:59.160 --> 04:00.160]  about that.
[04:00.160 --> 04:03.560]  I almost I almost decided to go up that route but maybe one day I'll release some of those
[04:03.560 --> 04:07.840]  77 seeds through some of the avenues that we do on Discord or other things like that.
[04:07.840 --> 04:10.440]  But right now there are no plans, no intentions.
[04:10.440 --> 04:16.000]  That is one of my hidden gems, secret vaults, secret weapons, private reserves.
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.320]  Once everybody is tired of all these stuff that I'm putting out, once King Solomon runs
[04:19.320 --> 04:23.320]  his course and gets boring, once the Jack the Ripper mail gets boring, once the blueberry
[04:23.320 --> 04:27.360]  cookies mail gets boring, once the golden goat mail gets boring, so we've got a lot
[04:27.360 --> 04:32.760]  of stuff to run through, then maybe we may play with some of the stuff from 77.
[04:32.760 --> 04:35.920]  I've pollinated that with a couple of things maybe in the future.
[04:35.920 --> 04:37.600]  All right, now I'm just rambling at this point.
[04:37.600 --> 04:42.040]  The quick answer, nah bro, no plans to put that one out to the public.
[04:42.040 --> 04:44.080]  Gotta have some private reserves, some secret stash.
[04:44.600 --> 04:49.840]  All right, let me cut myself off from a ramble and get to the next email here in today's episode.
[04:49.840 --> 04:52.280]  This one came from our friend, how did they sign this one?
[04:52.280 --> 04:54.200]  This one came from Brian420.
[04:54.200 --> 04:56.400]  Big shout out to our buddy Brian420.
[04:56.400 --> 04:57.880]  Thank you for the great message.
[04:57.880 --> 05:00.320]  This one goes a little bit like this.
[05:00.320 --> 05:02.800]  It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, I love your podcast.
[05:02.800 --> 05:07.800]  You deliver well-structured, accurate, and free cannabis knowledge and we appreciate it.
[05:07.800 --> 05:09.520]  Dude, I appreciate that compliment.
[05:10.160 --> 05:15.480]  Basically exactly what I'm trying to do, deliver structured cannabis content that new growers,
[05:15.480 --> 05:18.080]  pro growers, that every grower can understand.
[05:18.080 --> 05:23.000]  I wanna entertain and educate the guys in the trim room all the way to the guys in the lead
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.400]  of the grow, maybe even entertain the investors and the owners, maybe even encourage
[05:27.400 --> 05:30.560]  and educate some people who are just curious about cannabis.
[05:30.560 --> 05:32.120]  What was the old phrase?
[05:32.120 --> 05:36.160]  If you're a new grower, pro grower, I don't even remember what we used to say,
[05:36.200 --> 05:39.640]  old school smoker or new smoker, or even just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[05:39.640 --> 05:40.760]  some shit like that.
[05:40.760 --> 05:42.840]  That's what I used to say at the start of the show.
[05:42.840 --> 05:46.680]  I want everybody to feel included, involved, and participate.
[05:46.680 --> 05:50.160]  Somebody said that I do talk to you guys like you've never grown before.
[05:50.160 --> 05:53.960]  And I said, that's a good thing because many of you out there never have grown before.
[05:53.960 --> 05:58.760]  But I also try to include subjects, topics, and details that will keep even the most experienced,
[05:58.760 --> 06:01.520]  seasoned veteran growers entertained.
[06:01.520 --> 06:03.760]  I'm rambling once again, but welcome to the show.
[06:03.760 --> 06:06.360]  If you didn't know I was going to ramble, you must be new here.
[06:06.360 --> 06:07.480]  Thank you for the compliment, brother.
[06:07.480 --> 06:08.560]  That's where I'm headed.
[06:08.560 --> 06:12.440]  It goes on, it says, I've received a pack of Starstruck seeds.
[06:12.440 --> 06:13.280]  Good selection.
[06:13.280 --> 06:15.400]  I believe those are sold out in most venues.
[06:15.400 --> 06:16.440]  I don't have any more.
[06:16.440 --> 06:17.680]  I'm not going to make any more.
[06:17.680 --> 06:20.040]  So you were lucky to have those.
[06:20.040 --> 06:23.440]  It says, I've been growing and just wanted to send you an update.
[06:23.440 --> 06:24.560]  I appreciate that.
[06:24.560 --> 06:28.480]  I also must say that the phenol I have is perfectly structured,
[06:28.480 --> 06:30.240]  a perfectly structured plant.
[06:30.240 --> 06:33.600]  It's beautiful from the aroma to structure and resistance.
[06:34.480 --> 06:35.320]  Oh, we're going to skip that.
[06:35.320 --> 06:36.880]  Oh, can't wait to send you some flower picks.
[06:36.880 --> 06:38.600]  I thought you were going to say you're going to send me flower.
[06:38.600 --> 06:39.720]  Wasn't going to read that on the air.
[06:39.720 --> 06:41.880]  It says, can't wait to send you some flower picks
[06:41.880 --> 06:46.880]  as well as try to self and reverse her with my motivation phenol
[06:47.760 --> 06:48.720]  I've been working with.
[06:48.720 --> 06:50.080]  All right, I had to change pages here.
[06:50.080 --> 06:51.040]  So there's a lot going on there.
[06:51.040 --> 06:55.040]  He says that the Starstruck plant is perfectly structured.
[06:55.040 --> 06:56.680]  That is part of why I selected it.
[06:56.680 --> 06:59.160]  The Star Dog plant that worked with that
[06:59.160 --> 07:00.320]  was beautifully structured.
[07:00.320 --> 07:02.920]  It was one of my favorite in the commercial grow.
[07:03.080 --> 07:06.080]  Gave a very nice structure, very wonderful aroma,
[07:06.080 --> 07:07.520]  beautiful bag appeal.
[07:07.520 --> 07:10.320]  And like you said here, it was resistant to problems.
[07:10.320 --> 07:12.320]  On a commercial grow, we would experience
[07:12.320 --> 07:14.360]  a myriad of problems throughout the seasons.
[07:14.360 --> 07:16.120]  We'd get mites, powdery mildew.
[07:16.120 --> 07:17.680]  There's always something to learn how to battle
[07:17.680 --> 07:20.840]  on a new grow and the Star Dog just didn't seem to get it.
[07:20.840 --> 07:23.920]  That's part of why I decided to kidnap that plant
[07:23.920 --> 07:26.680]  and breed with it, put it in my breeding program.
[07:26.680 --> 07:29.320]  It was a great plant, just the original mom plant.
[07:29.320 --> 07:31.440]  That's where a lot of these traits are coming from
[07:31.480 --> 07:33.240]  is from that original Star Dog.
[07:33.240 --> 07:35.640]  Then like I like to say, Arise King Solomon,
[07:35.640 --> 07:38.160]  that dude is just the fixer, that is the turbocharger.
[07:38.160 --> 07:40.120]  That's like sending it to training camp.
[07:40.120 --> 07:41.840]  Any plant you put in the room with that,
[07:41.840 --> 07:43.160]  it just went through a six week camp
[07:43.160 --> 07:45.080]  and it'll come out ready for fighting.
[07:45.080 --> 07:47.760]  It's ready to make weight, ready to tap a motherfucker out.
[07:47.760 --> 07:49.640]  I am rambling, it's been a good day.
[07:49.640 --> 07:51.280]  Been smoking all the good shit.
[07:51.280 --> 07:52.840]  Let me find out where I am in this message.
[07:52.840 --> 07:54.620]  I'm on page two.
[07:54.620 --> 07:57.160]  So our friend has found a Star Dog Pheno they love.
[07:57.160 --> 07:59.480]  They're considering reversing it, preserving it,
[07:59.480 --> 08:02.520]  and crossing it with their motivation phenotype
[08:02.520 --> 08:03.480]  they've been working with.
[08:03.480 --> 08:05.360]  Then it says, keep up the awesomeness.
[08:05.360 --> 08:06.720]  P.S. a quick question.
[08:06.720 --> 08:08.600]  This is where the fun part comes in.
[08:08.600 --> 08:12.960]  Does a plant's structure change with maturity?
[08:12.960 --> 08:14.440]  And then he says, an example,
[08:14.440 --> 08:17.260]  nodes changing from growing across from one another
[08:17.260 --> 08:19.220]  to staggered node spacing.
[08:19.220 --> 08:21.740]  I ask because I've experienced something similar
[08:21.740 --> 08:23.360]  with a Star Struck clone.
[08:23.360 --> 08:26.520]  It looks structurally different from the parent plant.
[08:26.520 --> 08:27.700]  What do you think?
[08:27.700 --> 08:29.000]  That's a very good question, Brian.
[08:29.520 --> 08:31.800]  I've got a couple of different theories here,
[08:31.800 --> 08:34.560]  a couple of things that could be happening possibly.
[08:34.560 --> 08:37.240]  My first question, my first theory, my first idea,
[08:37.240 --> 08:39.440]  the very first thing that comes to mind is
[08:39.440 --> 08:42.240]  where did you cut the clones from?
[08:42.240 --> 08:44.000]  If you cut it from the main meristem,
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.080]  you're probably gonna get the symmetry,
[08:46.080 --> 08:48.080]  the symmetrical branching.
[08:48.080 --> 08:51.560]  That was harder than it looked to say symmetrical branching.
[08:51.560 --> 08:53.000]  You'll get that from the main meristem.
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.360]  However, if you cut from some of the side branches,
[08:55.360 --> 08:56.680]  then maybe you'll get some shoots,
[08:56.680 --> 08:58.560]  or maybe even the opposite on some plants.
[08:59.120 --> 09:00.600]  It kinda depends on how the plant grows.
[09:00.600 --> 09:03.600]  But, from most of my experience, if you cut the top,
[09:03.600 --> 09:04.920]  you're gonna get the symmetry.
[09:04.920 --> 09:08.280]  If you come from the sides, you may get the opposites,
[09:08.280 --> 09:09.160]  which you're talking about.
[09:09.160 --> 09:11.360]  Staggered node spacing is what you're saying.
[09:11.360 --> 09:15.120]  I think my first suspicion is that it would come from
[09:15.120 --> 09:18.680]  location in which those plants, those clones,
[09:18.680 --> 09:20.480]  particular clones were cut.
[09:20.480 --> 09:21.520]  I have no evidence of that.
[09:21.520 --> 09:23.400]  I wasn't there, I didn't see anything.
[09:23.400 --> 09:25.840]  I've got very little information to go on.
[09:25.840 --> 09:27.120]  I've got about a paragraph,
[09:27.120 --> 09:28.840]  about three sentences here to work with.
[09:28.840 --> 09:31.080]  So that is my first guess.
[09:31.080 --> 09:31.920]  Then,
[09:34.640 --> 09:37.120]  then let's just talk about some other phenomenon
[09:37.120 --> 09:38.240]  that could be happening there.
[09:38.240 --> 09:41.400]  Phenomena, phenomenon, things that could be happening there.
[09:41.400 --> 09:42.920]  I try to sound like a professional.
[09:42.920 --> 09:45.440]  Sometimes I don't know what the hell I'm even saying.
[09:45.440 --> 09:47.360]  Some other things that we should keep in mind
[09:47.360 --> 09:49.480]  is just phenotypical expression.
[09:49.480 --> 09:50.760]  Has the room changed?
[09:50.760 --> 09:52.160]  Is the environment different?
[09:52.160 --> 09:53.360]  That could make a big difference
[09:53.360 --> 09:54.440]  in the way that the plant grows.
[09:54.440 --> 09:57.040]  I don't know that that would necessarily change
[09:57.960 --> 09:59.240]  the staggered node spacing,
[09:59.240 --> 10:00.560]  but that is going to make a difference
[10:00.560 --> 10:03.000]  in the way that the plant would grow in a different room.
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.040]  I just wanna talk about that
[10:04.040 --> 10:05.400]  because that's a fun avenue to go down.
[10:05.400 --> 10:07.120]  Phenotypical expression.
[10:07.120 --> 10:10.240]  If we took the same plant and we cut 10 clones
[10:10.240 --> 10:12.000]  and we didn't take one out of the main meristem,
[10:12.000 --> 10:13.800]  we took it from the branches all around the sides,
[10:13.800 --> 10:15.520]  we had 10 beautiful clones,
[10:15.520 --> 10:17.400]  we gave them to 10 different growers
[10:17.400 --> 10:19.240]  to put in 10 different rooms,
[10:19.240 --> 10:22.160]  we may see 10 wildly different results.
[10:22.160 --> 10:24.880]  The flowers are going to look, smell, taste,
[10:24.880 --> 10:27.920]  and affect us all differently based on things
[10:27.920 --> 10:28.760]  and their growth.
[10:28.760 --> 10:30.520]  First of all, we've got,
[10:30.520 --> 10:32.280]  so there's like lights, air, water, soil,
[10:32.280 --> 10:33.320]  all that stuff to think about.
[10:33.320 --> 10:35.480]  The light is probably our first factor.
[10:35.480 --> 10:37.720]  One person, a lot of people nowadays
[10:37.720 --> 10:39.800]  will probably grow under an LED.
[10:39.800 --> 10:42.400]  Some people are going to grow under ceramic metal halides.
[10:42.400 --> 10:45.240]  Somebody will grow under an HPS light.
[10:45.240 --> 10:46.800]  Somebody's gonna grow still
[10:46.800 --> 10:48.480]  under a fucking stolen street light
[10:48.480 --> 10:50.920]  that they got from way back in the day.
[10:50.920 --> 10:53.120]  Somebody's gonna use some cheap ass Borpo light.
[10:53.160 --> 10:55.560]  Somebody's gonna use the most expensive
[10:55.560 --> 10:57.400]  fucking LED on the market.
[10:57.400 --> 10:59.160]  So that's lighting, that's right there.
[10:59.160 --> 11:00.560]  We've got so many variables.
[11:00.560 --> 11:02.560]  The guy using that HPS that he stole
[11:02.560 --> 11:05.400]  compared to the guy using the super expensive LED.
[11:05.400 --> 11:06.740]  He's got that R switch on there,
[11:06.740 --> 11:08.760]  so he's giving them far red light.
[11:08.760 --> 11:10.680]  Way different effects from those lights
[11:10.680 --> 11:12.920]  compared to the stolen shop light
[11:12.920 --> 11:15.280]  and a way different effect compared to all of those
[11:15.280 --> 11:16.880]  compared to that ceramic metal halide.
[11:16.880 --> 11:19.220]  Maybe someone's running a T5, the whole grow.
[11:19.220 --> 11:20.580]  Lots of variables for lighting
[11:20.580 --> 11:22.620]  that's going to give us different shapes,
[11:22.620 --> 11:25.660]  different structures, different bud density
[11:25.660 --> 11:28.180]  is going to be something we definitely notice from that.
[11:28.180 --> 11:29.700]  Then let's talk about air.
[11:29.700 --> 11:32.180]  It is definitely going to be a different temperature
[11:32.180 --> 11:36.540]  and different humidity, different basic VPD in every grow.
[11:36.540 --> 11:38.140]  It's going to be a couple of points off
[11:38.140 --> 11:39.980]  no matter which grow we go to.
[11:39.980 --> 11:41.420]  Either the temperature will be different,
[11:41.420 --> 11:42.580]  the humidity will be different,
[11:42.580 --> 11:44.500]  the diurnal swings will be different.
[11:44.500 --> 11:46.180]  It's going to be different in every grow.
[11:46.180 --> 11:48.020]  I promise you, all of the grows
[11:48.020 --> 11:50.220]  you'll have noticeable differences.
[11:50.220 --> 11:52.780]  That is going to affect plant structure,
[11:52.780 --> 11:56.540]  leaf shape and size, bud density, bud size,
[11:56.540 --> 11:58.180]  flavor, terpenes, aroma,
[11:58.180 --> 12:00.940]  stickiness of the overall final product.
[12:00.940 --> 12:03.900]  That's going to have a big role in your whole room.
[12:03.900 --> 12:05.620]  The VPD makes a big difference.
[12:05.620 --> 12:07.260]  You got 10 different rooms.
[12:07.260 --> 12:09.580]  One guy, the guy running that stolen HPS,
[12:09.580 --> 12:11.140]  he's probably got a hot room also.
[12:11.140 --> 12:12.660]  His buds are gonna get fluffy.
[12:12.660 --> 12:15.660]  He's going to encourage more limening production.
[12:15.660 --> 12:17.700]  He's gonna have taller, more slender plants.
[12:17.700 --> 12:21.100]  The guy with the plant with the R switch on his LED,
[12:21.100 --> 12:23.500]  his plants are gonna be shorter, squattier,
[12:23.500 --> 12:26.300]  maybe better node spacing, maybe denser buds.
[12:26.300 --> 12:27.700]  There's gonna be differences throughout
[12:27.700 --> 12:28.980]  just because of the lighting
[12:28.980 --> 12:31.380]  and the way that the humidity are affecting each other.
[12:31.380 --> 12:32.700]  I'm saying there's gonna be a lot of variables.
[12:32.700 --> 12:33.660]  Let me get to the point here
[12:33.660 --> 12:35.380]  because I can ramble on this forever.
[12:35.380 --> 12:37.100]  We've still got nutrients to talk about.
[12:37.100 --> 12:38.820]  We've got soil to talk about.
[12:38.820 --> 12:40.620]  It could be cocoa, it could be hydroponic.
[12:40.620 --> 12:42.700]  All of these things are going to make a difference
[12:42.700 --> 12:43.980]  in how the plants perform.
[12:43.980 --> 12:46.340]  You'll see different growth structures, shapes.
[12:46.340 --> 12:48.980]  The leaves can change size and shape,
[12:48.980 --> 12:50.700]  not completely drastically,
[12:50.700 --> 12:53.300]  but they can show you a little bit thinner leaf
[12:53.300 --> 12:55.020]  in a higher humidity environment,
[12:55.020 --> 12:57.500]  a thicker leaf in a lower, maybe even the opposite.
[12:57.500 --> 12:59.380]  It's all about where the plant came from
[12:59.380 --> 13:02.220]  and how it is replying or reacting or responding
[13:02.220 --> 13:04.500]  to the environment which you have now stuck that plant in.
[13:04.500 --> 13:07.820]  That is the phenotypical expression that you're gonna see.
[13:07.820 --> 13:09.780]  So what you could be seeing,
[13:09.780 --> 13:11.340]  the short version of what I'm trying to say
[13:11.340 --> 13:13.500]  is this could just be phenotypical expression.
[13:13.500 --> 13:15.100]  Maybe the room has changed.
[13:15.100 --> 13:16.580]  Maybe you're growing it in a different room
[13:16.580 --> 13:18.060]  than you did before.
[13:18.060 --> 13:19.180]  Maybe it's just changed.
[13:19.180 --> 13:21.380]  Also, this plant is aging in life.
[13:21.380 --> 13:23.340]  If you're taking a clone from a plant
[13:23.340 --> 13:24.860]  and taking a clone from a plant,
[13:24.860 --> 13:26.580]  the plant is continuing to age.
[13:26.580 --> 13:28.500]  That plant's as old as that original plant
[13:28.500 --> 13:31.120]  that you started with, so there is age in that plant.
[13:31.120 --> 13:32.320]  Maybe it has changed.
[13:33.440 --> 13:35.300]  It is not genetic drift.
[13:35.300 --> 13:37.780]  That is technically not what genetic drift is,
[13:37.780 --> 13:38.860]  but there is a technical word
[13:38.860 --> 13:40.700]  that will not come to my brain right now.
[13:40.700 --> 13:42.420]  The plants basically do change.
[13:42.420 --> 13:44.420]  They can change over time.
[13:44.420 --> 13:46.060]  Everything changes over time.
[13:46.060 --> 13:47.060]  That is very possible.
[13:47.060 --> 13:48.460]  That could be happening.
[13:48.460 --> 13:51.820]  So my main three options are going to be
[13:51.820 --> 13:53.500]  where you cut the clone from.
[13:53.500 --> 13:55.640]  Then it's going to be phenotypical change.
[13:55.640 --> 13:58.100]  Then also, it's something with the hormones
[13:58.100 --> 13:59.220]  and changes of the plant.
[13:59.220 --> 14:00.740]  The plant is just evolving.
[14:00.740 --> 14:01.780]  It's getting older.
[14:01.780 --> 14:04.180]  Those all three could be very possible,
[14:04.180 --> 14:06.500]  very likely culprits for what is happening,
[14:06.500 --> 14:09.220]  which you are experiencing in your garden.
[14:09.220 --> 14:10.700]  All right, Brian420,
[14:10.700 --> 14:12.700]  I think I rambled on long enough about that one.
[14:12.700 --> 14:14.580]  I want to thank you for a great question.
[14:14.580 --> 14:16.380]  If you've got any more follow-up questions,
[14:16.380 --> 14:18.300]  you know I'd love to hear from you.
[14:18.300 --> 14:21.940]  Everybody, the email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[14:21.940 --> 14:22.780]  Don't be shy.
[14:22.780 --> 14:23.620]  Reach out.
[14:23.620 --> 14:25.900]  I do love the listener interaction.
[14:25.900 --> 14:28.660]  All right, this next message comes from my friend Mud,
[14:28.660 --> 14:30.900]  and it goes a little bit like this.
[14:30.900 --> 14:31.740]  It says,
[14:31.740 --> 14:35.540]  Ross DeJeff, I recently purchased some morning dew reg seeds
[14:35.540 --> 14:36.940]  from Seeds Here Now.
[14:36.940 --> 14:39.740]  Big shout out to our friends at seedsherenow.com.
[14:39.740 --> 14:41.740]  It says, I would like to breed a plant
[14:41.740 --> 14:43.300]  to my chem dog variety
[14:43.300 --> 14:45.740]  to introduce the anti-powdery mildew,
[14:45.740 --> 14:49.420]  anti-bud rot properties to my chem.
[14:49.420 --> 14:51.220]  So if you've been following my brand
[14:51.220 --> 14:52.900]  or my podcast for a while,
[14:52.900 --> 14:54.820]  you know that my line Morning Dew
[14:54.820 --> 14:57.740]  has been discovered that is very resistant
[14:57.740 --> 14:59.940]  to powdery mildew and bud rot.
[14:59.940 --> 15:01.460]  The past couple of outdoor seasons,
[15:01.460 --> 15:03.740]  we've seen a lot of gardens get decimated
[15:03.740 --> 15:05.860]  by powdery mildew and by bud rot.
[15:05.860 --> 15:07.900]  The Morning Dew, we've gotten a lot of reports
[15:07.900 --> 15:10.300]  that it withstood all of those stresses.
[15:10.300 --> 15:11.980]  Plants next to it, we're getting mildew.
[15:11.980 --> 15:13.580]  Plants next to it, we're getting rot.
[15:13.580 --> 15:16.420]  And the Morning Dew withstood all of the struggles.
[15:17.260 --> 15:19.260]  So our friend Mud here wants to get
[15:19.260 --> 15:21.060]  a quality Morning Dew male
[15:21.060 --> 15:25.180]  and breed that to his chem dog varietal female.
[15:25.180 --> 15:26.420]  Now it goes on to say,
[15:26.420 --> 15:27.660]  I know it's your indica,
[15:27.660 --> 15:29.580]  I know it's your version of an indica.
[15:29.580 --> 15:31.620]  I've been following the podcast for a while now,
[15:31.620 --> 15:34.300]  and I haven't heard you speak much about this.
[15:34.300 --> 15:36.140]  Is there a reason why?
[15:37.140 --> 15:39.340]  No, I just don't, without being prompted,
[15:39.340 --> 15:40.940]  I don't really talk too much about my strains.
[15:40.940 --> 15:42.900]  I've done full strain reports.
[15:42.900 --> 15:44.660]  I think I've done a full strain report
[15:44.660 --> 15:46.660]  on the Morning Dew, talking about the way it grows,
[15:46.660 --> 15:47.780]  the way it smokes.
[15:47.780 --> 15:51.100]  I'm not sure if we knew about the resistance
[15:51.100 --> 15:52.420]  to powdery mildew at the time.
[15:52.420 --> 15:54.060]  A lot more people have grown it.
[15:54.060 --> 15:55.780]  The plant has been, the seeds have been sold.
[15:55.780 --> 15:57.340]  The plant has been experienced more.
[15:57.340 --> 15:58.900]  So I don't know how much of that I talked about
[15:58.900 --> 16:00.580]  in that old episode.
[16:00.580 --> 16:02.860]  There's no reason I don't talk about the Morning Dew
[16:02.860 --> 16:05.260]  or that it's being one of my indicas or anything.
[16:05.260 --> 16:06.460]  It's just, like I said,
[16:06.460 --> 16:07.620]  I don't really talk about the strains
[16:07.620 --> 16:08.500]  without being prompted.
[16:08.500 --> 16:10.060]  You have to ask a question, which you did here.
[16:10.060 --> 16:11.420]  So we will talk about it.
[16:12.700 --> 16:15.380]  And I talked about the Grateful Dog in the last episode.
[16:15.380 --> 16:18.140]  So the Grateful Dog is the,
[16:18.140 --> 16:19.500]  the Morning Dew is the Grateful Dog
[16:19.500 --> 16:21.420]  pollinated by King Solomon.
[16:21.420 --> 16:24.060]  And most of the phenotypes seem to put off
[16:24.060 --> 16:28.380]  a more indica type quality than the sativa type qualities.
[16:28.380 --> 16:30.220]  They finish more quickly than most sativas.
[16:30.220 --> 16:32.340]  The buzz is more indica dominant.
[16:32.340 --> 16:35.660]  It grows more with the wider leaf type of a structure.
[16:35.660 --> 16:37.700]  Some of the phenotypes do have skinnier leaves,
[16:37.740 --> 16:39.860]  but the plants stay short and squat
[16:39.860 --> 16:41.540]  and the buds get dense.
[16:41.540 --> 16:43.500]  More like what we know as an indica
[16:43.500 --> 16:46.020]  or what I would qualify, classify as an indica.
[16:46.020 --> 16:47.940]  It will get you in your head a little bit when you smoke it,
[16:47.940 --> 16:49.820]  but it's gonna be more of that,
[16:49.820 --> 16:52.660]  I'm gonna say more of an indica varietal.
[16:52.660 --> 16:55.180]  Then it says, I haven't ever bred before,
[16:55.180 --> 16:56.940]  but I thought this would be a good cross.
[16:56.940 --> 17:00.420]  My chem has almost Satsuma hazy funk,
[17:00.420 --> 17:02.700]  super triked out and the yields are no problem,
[17:02.700 --> 17:05.180]  but it does have a problem with powdery mildew.
[17:05.180 --> 17:08.540]  And it goes on to say, my question is two parts.
[17:08.540 --> 17:09.860]  Do you mind if I breed with it?
[17:09.860 --> 17:12.260]  It's for personal, I'm not selling the beans.
[17:12.260 --> 17:14.260]  And then can you give me a breakdown
[17:14.260 --> 17:17.740]  of what type of phenotypes to expect in advance?
[17:17.740 --> 17:20.460]  You can call me mud as my friends do.
[17:20.460 --> 17:21.620]  And thank you in advance.
[17:21.620 --> 17:23.420]  All right, mud, thank you for the great message.
[17:23.420 --> 17:24.940]  Thank you for the good questions.
[17:24.940 --> 17:28.020]  Let's answer your questions about the morning dew
[17:28.020 --> 17:29.220]  and breeding with it.
[17:29.220 --> 17:31.340]  I feel this way about all of my strains,
[17:31.340 --> 17:33.300]  any seeds that you buy from me,
[17:33.500 --> 17:36.980]  once you've given me or a vendor or a trader
[17:36.980 --> 17:40.020]  or anybody money for those seeds, they are yours.
[17:40.020 --> 17:41.500]  You can do whatever you want with them
[17:41.500 --> 17:43.020]  and I can't be mad about it.
[17:43.020 --> 17:44.140]  You've paid money.
[17:44.140 --> 17:46.700]  My job is to make the seeds, make quality seeds,
[17:46.700 --> 17:48.620]  test them, make sure they're reliable,
[17:48.620 --> 17:49.980]  get them out to you.
[17:49.980 --> 17:52.100]  At that point, basically I got paid.
[17:52.100 --> 17:53.620]  My end of the bargain is up.
[17:53.620 --> 17:55.420]  I make sure you get quality customer service
[17:55.420 --> 17:57.260]  if you have a problem, if you have an issue,
[17:57.260 --> 17:58.100]  I'm here for that.
[17:58.100 --> 18:00.780]  But those seeds are yours, grow them, have fun,
[18:00.780 --> 18:03.260]  breed with them, do what you must.
[18:04.100 --> 18:04.940]  You paid your money for them.
[18:04.940 --> 18:05.860]  That's like me telling you,
[18:05.860 --> 18:08.100]  you can't drive your car as fast as you want
[18:08.100 --> 18:08.940]  once you bought the car.
[18:08.940 --> 18:10.820]  Once you bought the seeds, bro, they're yours,
[18:10.820 --> 18:12.020]  have a good time.
[18:12.020 --> 18:14.700]  Also, be respectful about that.
[18:14.700 --> 18:17.420]  There is kind of a breeder's code of ethics.
[18:17.420 --> 18:18.660]  There is a code of ethics.
[18:18.660 --> 18:20.460]  You notice when I make a cross,
[18:20.460 --> 18:23.900]  I always list the true genetics of what that cross is.
[18:23.900 --> 18:26.300]  I reveal almost everything to you guys.
[18:26.300 --> 18:27.500]  I like to be transparent.
[18:27.500 --> 18:29.420]  I feel like you guys trust me and believe in me
[18:29.420 --> 18:31.380]  because of my transparency.
[18:31.380 --> 18:34.540]  So in return, whenever you put out a seed
[18:34.540 --> 18:36.740]  or whatever you do, whatever you post a picture of it,
[18:36.740 --> 18:38.500]  just maybe put in little parentheses.
[18:38.500 --> 18:41.540]  This is Rasta Jeff's morning due to my,
[18:41.540 --> 18:42.940]  what was it called?
[18:42.940 --> 18:45.580]  Motivation, I think you called it, or do it correctly.
[18:45.580 --> 18:48.020]  When you list genetics, list the ladies first.
[18:48.020 --> 18:49.060]  It's always ladies first.
[18:49.060 --> 18:52.300]  So girl plant, ex-male plant in the parentheses there.
[18:52.300 --> 18:54.780]  But if you ever talk about it, list it, advertise it,
[18:54.780 --> 18:56.660]  promote it, if somebody says, what is that?
[18:56.660 --> 18:58.260]  Just give me a shout out, give me a fist bump,
[18:58.260 --> 18:59.860]  give me some credit, give me some love.
[18:59.860 --> 19:01.780]  That's all I ask for.
[19:01.780 --> 19:04.660]  You notice when I talk about a lot of strains
[19:04.660 --> 19:06.300]  that I work with, a lot of strains that I breed with,
[19:06.300 --> 19:07.860]  I tell you straight up who they came from,
[19:07.860 --> 19:09.220]  who I got the cuts from.
[19:09.220 --> 19:12.060]  I didn't invent cannabis, I didn't invent seeds.
[19:12.060 --> 19:13.780]  I didn't just fart out a bunch of seeds
[19:13.780 --> 19:14.600]  and start with those.
[19:14.600 --> 19:17.580]  I had to get plants and seeds from other breeders,
[19:17.580 --> 19:19.580]  other people that were putting out quality products,
[19:19.580 --> 19:24.020]  things I enjoyed, trusted, liked, relied on,
[19:24.020 --> 19:26.780]  was impressed by, by breeders that I like.
[19:26.780 --> 19:29.200]  Also, I only work with strains from breeders
[19:29.240 --> 19:30.120]  that I enjoy also.
[19:30.120 --> 19:31.920]  You gotta be kind of a cool person.
[19:31.920 --> 19:33.360]  If I find out that you're not super cool,
[19:33.360 --> 19:35.640]  maybe I'll eliminate your plants from my garden.
[19:35.640 --> 19:37.360]  Things like that do matter to me at this point.
[19:37.360 --> 19:39.520]  And I've got the opportunity to be very selective
[19:39.520 --> 19:41.680]  and picky at this point also.
[19:41.680 --> 19:43.340]  But I ramble on.
[19:43.340 --> 19:45.120]  My point is, once I've sold you those seeds,
[19:45.120 --> 19:46.800]  dude, you could do whatever you want with them.
[19:46.800 --> 19:48.920]  I appreciate that you like my seed line enough
[19:48.920 --> 19:51.840]  and you trust in what I've said and the reviews
[19:51.840 --> 19:53.140]  and you trust in the product enough
[19:53.140 --> 19:56.200]  that you've chosen to breed that to your seeds
[19:56.200 --> 19:58.840]  to try to make a better product to fix the problem in there.
[19:59.480 --> 20:00.640]  Now you see what I'm saying by saying
[20:00.640 --> 20:02.440]  that King Solomon is the fixer.
[20:02.440 --> 20:05.140]  You're going to use the morning dew to try to be the fixer.
[20:05.140 --> 20:08.340]  You found the recipe to make your pie a little bit better.
[20:08.340 --> 20:09.180]  I am rambling.
[20:09.180 --> 20:12.040]  So the overall answer to part one of your question is,
[20:12.040 --> 20:14.240]  yes, you do have full permission to breed
[20:14.240 --> 20:16.640]  with the seeds that you get from me.
[20:16.640 --> 20:18.840]  Just give me some credit, give me some respect.
[20:18.840 --> 20:21.400]  Anybody out there, if you breed with my seeds,
[20:21.400 --> 20:23.280]  my plants, my clones, whatever,
[20:23.280 --> 20:25.040]  just show me love, give me respect.
[20:25.040 --> 20:27.480]  Maybe send me a 10-pack if you can.
[20:27.480 --> 20:28.320]  Not a big deal.
[20:28.720 --> 20:29.960]  I don't have a lot of room to run a lot of stuff,
[20:29.960 --> 20:31.480]  but if it's super intriguing,
[20:31.480 --> 20:34.920]  you may see pictures of your cross pop up on my social media
[20:34.920 --> 20:36.920]  pop up in my crosses in the future.
[20:36.920 --> 20:39.000]  Maybe I'll send you more shit in return.
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.640]  We can establish friendships and relationships like that.
[20:41.640 --> 20:43.080]  I try to get seeds back to the people
[20:43.080 --> 20:44.560]  who give me clones and things.
[20:44.560 --> 20:46.180]  I try to keep the circle going.
[20:46.180 --> 20:47.680]  All right, let me keep going
[20:47.680 --> 20:51.160]  because there is a second part to our buddy Mud's question.
[20:51.160 --> 20:53.000]  It says, could you give me a breakdown
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  of the phenos to expect from the morning dew?
[20:56.960 --> 21:00.000]  Like I said, I've done the full podcast on the morning dew.
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.080]  If you search the Grow From Your Heart podcast morning dew,
[21:03.080 --> 21:04.280]  there should be a full episode,
[21:04.280 --> 21:08.400]  but we will do a quick phenotype expectation rundown here
[21:08.400 --> 21:10.160]  since you're gonna breed with it.
[21:10.160 --> 21:13.500]  There are three main phenotypical categories,
[21:13.500 --> 21:15.680]  and I've stopped saying main phenotypes.
[21:15.680 --> 21:18.000]  I'm going to start putting phenotypes into categories
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.760]  because I'm a category kind of guy,
[21:20.760 --> 21:22.920]  and it sets a better expectation.
[21:22.920 --> 21:25.520]  You're not looking for this specific plant.
[21:26.040 --> 21:28.720]  I like that you're looking for specific phenotypes,
[21:28.720 --> 21:31.480]  but also I want you to find the one that's good for you.
[21:31.480 --> 21:34.120]  It's like if I say, I like this phenotype,
[21:34.120 --> 21:37.320]  you may pass on the one that would have been stellar for you
[21:37.320 --> 21:39.120]  because you chose the one that's great for me,
[21:39.120 --> 21:40.840]  and you could add something better.
[21:40.840 --> 21:43.800]  And I always explain it like we went to a restaurant.
[21:43.800 --> 21:45.440]  You narrowed it down that you want Italian food,
[21:45.440 --> 21:47.360]  and we sat at the restaurant, read the menu.
[21:47.360 --> 21:49.280]  I'm gonna get something garlicky with white sauce.
[21:49.280 --> 21:51.160]  You might want something with red sauce.
[21:51.160 --> 21:52.760]  The other person might not want any sauce.
[21:52.760 --> 21:54.400]  They might just get buttery pasta.
[21:55.040 --> 21:57.200]  We've all established we want morning dew,
[21:57.200 --> 21:58.880]  but I might want a different phenotype
[21:58.880 --> 22:00.040]  of morning dew than you.
[22:00.040 --> 22:01.160]  You might want the cushy one.
[22:01.160 --> 22:02.600]  I might want the gassy one.
[22:02.600 --> 22:03.640]  Somebody else might want the one
[22:03.640 --> 22:05.280]  with the berry funk at the end of it.
[22:05.280 --> 22:07.320]  So find the phenotype that works best for you
[22:07.320 --> 22:09.600]  is my bottom line, my best advice.
[22:09.600 --> 22:11.880]  Now, the phenotypical categories,
[22:11.880 --> 22:14.520]  which you can expect from the morning dew,
[22:14.520 --> 22:17.240]  there is the OG Kush leaner.
[22:17.240 --> 22:20.720]  There's one that has got cushy rocks to it.
[22:20.720 --> 22:22.200]  That one grows.
[22:22.200 --> 22:24.000]  It's got a stretchier structure,
[22:24.640 --> 22:25.560]  and it grows a bunch of rocks.
[22:25.560 --> 22:26.520]  That one is gonna be great.
[22:26.520 --> 22:30.160]  It's gonna be cushy, gassy, mothballs, real pungent.
[22:30.160 --> 22:32.200]  Then there's another, which I call the,
[22:32.200 --> 22:33.640]  it's the chem leaning phenotype,
[22:33.640 --> 22:37.560]  which you can identify by the acorn style buds.
[22:37.560 --> 22:39.280]  It doesn't grow real long buds.
[22:39.280 --> 22:41.920]  It doesn't grow real chunky, rocky buds,
[22:41.920 --> 22:43.520]  but they are shaped like a pine cone.
[22:43.520 --> 22:45.080]  They're just nice, perfect triangles,
[22:45.080 --> 22:47.000]  and they're all over the plant.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.520]  That phenotype tends to turn a little bit purple,
[22:49.520 --> 22:52.420]  a little bit silver, a little bit darker colors.
[22:52.420 --> 22:55.500]  Then of course, there is the arise dominant phenotype.
[22:55.500 --> 22:57.660]  That is the phenotype that gets spears.
[22:57.660 --> 22:59.940]  That is the one that makes the long spears.
[22:59.940 --> 23:02.260]  So if you've got rocks, it's gonna be more cushy.
[23:02.260 --> 23:04.780]  If you got pine cones, that's more chemi.
[23:04.780 --> 23:06.100]  If you get the spears,
[23:06.100 --> 23:08.580]  that's gonna have a lot of arise in it.
[23:08.580 --> 23:10.180]  Now, it sounds like in your situation,
[23:10.180 --> 23:12.120]  you're going to need a male plant.
[23:12.120 --> 23:14.380]  So I would find a male plant with a nice structure.
[23:14.380 --> 23:15.860]  Just look for the one that is shaped
[23:15.860 --> 23:17.540]  the way you want it to be shaped.
[23:17.540 --> 23:19.580]  You're probably going to get five,
[23:19.580 --> 23:21.700]  maybe a 10 pack of seeds, maybe more than that.
[23:22.140 --> 23:24.140]  Out of the male plants that you get,
[23:24.140 --> 23:26.220]  the first, if you've got a 10 pack,
[23:26.220 --> 23:27.980]  you're probably gonna get five males.
[23:27.980 --> 23:32.420]  I would eliminate those first two super hyper vigorous males.
[23:32.420 --> 23:33.660]  Just get rid of them.
[23:33.660 --> 23:36.260]  My reason for that is they're going to add
[23:36.260 --> 23:37.900]  too much to the mix.
[23:37.900 --> 23:39.460]  When we're breeding, most of the time,
[23:39.460 --> 23:41.820]  the goal is to kind of combine the two plants
[23:41.820 --> 23:43.780]  and see the representation of both parents
[23:43.780 --> 23:44.740]  in your offspring,
[23:44.740 --> 23:47.300]  unless you're trying to lock down one specific trait.
[23:47.300 --> 23:50.660]  I like to see what the male and the female can do together.
[23:50.660 --> 23:51.900]  If you've got a male plant
[23:51.900 --> 23:53.940]  that is just too dominant in the mix,
[23:53.940 --> 23:56.060]  he'll wash out all of the traits of the female
[23:56.060 --> 23:58.980]  and you're basically reproducing that male plant.
[23:58.980 --> 24:01.080]  So I like to find a male that's not a real meathead,
[24:01.080 --> 24:04.340]  not just real super aggressive, super vigorous,
[24:04.340 --> 24:08.540]  too crazy to flower early, grows real crazy tall.
[24:08.540 --> 24:09.980]  That's not the dude that I would use.
[24:09.980 --> 24:12.460]  If I had five seeds, the third and fourth seeds
[24:12.460 --> 24:14.100]  are probably the candidates.
[24:14.100 --> 24:16.980]  The third and fourth males to show me that they're males,
[24:16.980 --> 24:19.900]  to show their vigor, their aggression, I guess it is,
[24:19.900 --> 24:22.220]  those are gonna be the two that I start
[24:22.220 --> 24:24.260]  really eyeballing as my males.
[24:24.260 --> 24:26.660]  So find a good male, find somebody with good structure,
[24:26.660 --> 24:29.180]  find somebody that flowers at the appropriate time.
[24:29.180 --> 24:32.100]  Find a male that puts out a decent amount of pollen.
[24:32.100 --> 24:33.060]  Do the stem rub.
[24:33.060 --> 24:34.300]  I like a male plant.
[24:34.300 --> 24:36.100]  So you're gonna grow it the morning dew.
[24:36.100 --> 24:38.720]  Look for the one that smells like vomit.
[24:38.720 --> 24:40.100]  I know it sounds crazy.
[24:40.100 --> 24:41.820]  Male plants, when you rub the stem,
[24:41.820 --> 24:43.420]  if it smells like acrid puke,
[24:43.420 --> 24:47.140]  that is always a good trait in a male plant, in my opinion.
[24:47.140 --> 24:48.060]  That's just my opinion.
[24:48.060 --> 24:49.100]  That's from my experience.
[24:49.100 --> 24:53.500]  I love that disgusting, acrid, vomit, puke,
[24:53.500 --> 24:56.460]  bar trash can, gross smells that always turns
[24:56.460 --> 24:59.980]  into a good male plant that puts out good turps
[24:59.980 --> 25:01.460]  in its progeny.
[25:01.460 --> 25:03.900]  The offspring will always smell really good
[25:03.900 --> 25:06.540]  if the male plant smells like vomit.
[25:06.540 --> 25:09.020]  So I would work on finding a good male plant.
[25:09.020 --> 25:11.220]  You're not gonna see the bud structure
[25:11.220 --> 25:12.360]  that we see from the females
[25:12.360 --> 25:14.220]  because you're gonna be looking for a boy.
[25:14.220 --> 25:17.300]  So find a good shape, find a good structure.
[25:17.300 --> 25:19.260]  Find one with big, thick, robust stems
[25:19.260 --> 25:21.340]  that you can work and bend and it doesn't explode
[25:21.340 --> 25:22.620]  when you pop and twist it
[25:22.620 --> 25:25.160]  because you want the progeny to keep that trait as well.
[25:25.160 --> 25:28.540]  Find one that puts out pollen in the right amount of time.
[25:28.540 --> 25:30.940]  If you can, finish this male plant out.
[25:30.940 --> 25:31.940]  See how far they go.
[25:31.940 --> 25:34.860]  Put a few male plants in a room, isolate them,
[25:34.860 --> 25:36.060]  let them flower out.
[25:36.060 --> 25:37.300]  See which one you like the best.
[25:37.300 --> 25:39.720]  Do a phenotype just like you do with the females.
[25:39.720 --> 25:40.900]  Look at the bud cluster.
[25:40.900 --> 25:42.020]  Look at the color.
[25:42.020 --> 25:44.300]  Do the male plants put out any color?
[25:44.300 --> 25:46.940]  Are the male flowers turning purple?
[25:47.580 --> 25:48.500]  Do they put out trichomes?
[25:48.500 --> 25:50.860]  Do they smell good when they put out buds?
[25:50.860 --> 25:53.060]  Then do they get deficiencies?
[25:53.060 --> 25:54.340]  Do they handle your feeding well?
[25:54.340 --> 25:55.260]  Do you have any bugs?
[25:55.260 --> 25:58.140]  Do those male plants get beat up by bugs?
[25:58.140 --> 25:59.600]  Later on in the life of the plant,
[25:59.600 --> 26:01.520]  how bad do those leaves start crinkling up?
[26:01.520 --> 26:03.080]  How long does it last?
[26:03.080 --> 26:05.400]  That's gonna tell you a lot about the offspring.
[26:05.400 --> 26:08.220]  What you see in that male plant is 50%
[26:08.220 --> 26:10.820]  of what you're going to see in the offspring.
[26:10.820 --> 26:14.300]  So find a good combo, a good pairing for your plant
[26:14.300 --> 26:15.460]  that you call motivation.
[26:15.460 --> 26:17.300]  I think that is, it's going to be,
[26:17.300 --> 26:19.780]  so I say this a lot when it comes to breeding,
[26:19.780 --> 26:22.260]  learn about Mendel charts, learn about alleles,
[26:22.260 --> 26:25.860]  learn about chromosome transfer, learn all of that stuff.
[26:25.860 --> 26:27.380]  Then forget it all.
[26:27.380 --> 26:28.780]  Look at two plants and say,
[26:28.780 --> 26:30.060]  those are the two plants right there
[26:30.060 --> 26:31.140]  that need to be bred together.
[26:31.140 --> 26:33.780]  Use the grower and breeder intuition.
[26:33.780 --> 26:35.500]  I think that will work great for you.
[26:35.500 --> 26:38.140]  Understand the charts, understand the science,
[26:38.140 --> 26:39.860]  understand the biology.
[26:39.860 --> 26:43.220]  Then understand that you've got to grow from your heart,
[26:43.220 --> 26:44.220]  breed with love.
[26:44.220 --> 26:45.780]  That's how I have the greatest success.
[26:45.780 --> 26:48.180]  I draw the charts, I think about the Mendel charts,
[26:48.180 --> 26:49.780]  I really envision it in my head,
[26:49.780 --> 26:51.400]  and then I go, no, you know what?
[26:51.400 --> 26:52.860]  That plant and that plant right there
[26:52.860 --> 26:55.380]  need to make some seeds and it's gonna be fucking awesome.
[26:55.380 --> 26:57.060]  Most of the time, I am correct.
[26:57.060 --> 27:00.260]  So develop your intuition, check out the plants.
[27:00.260 --> 27:01.820]  Like I said, grow from your heart.
[27:01.820 --> 27:03.740]  The bottom line, breed with love.
[27:03.740 --> 27:05.540]  You're making this cross for yourself.
[27:05.540 --> 27:07.580]  You're gonna have a lot of seeds to play with.
[27:07.580 --> 27:11.020]  There will be a resistant phenotype within that first mix.
[27:11.020 --> 27:13.420]  You'll find a couple, a bunch, hopefully in there.
[27:13.420 --> 27:15.780]  You'll find what you're looking for.
[27:15.780 --> 27:17.540]  Almost no matter which male you select,
[27:17.540 --> 27:19.260]  that trait will pop up, it'll be there.
[27:19.260 --> 27:21.180]  It is in the mix, it's in the gene pool.
[27:21.180 --> 27:24.380]  I do believe you'll find that resistance trait.
[27:24.380 --> 27:26.020]  It could pass on.
[27:26.020 --> 27:28.860]  I think that is all I've got for this episode.
[27:28.860 --> 27:31.460]  My buddy, Mud, thank you for the great message.
[27:31.460 --> 27:34.780]  I have got Primus songs stuck in my head now.
[27:34.780 --> 27:37.700]  Also, I did say there are three categories of phenotypes.
[27:37.700 --> 27:38.720]  I have another note here.
[27:38.720 --> 27:39.700]  There are some weirdos.
[27:39.700 --> 27:41.180]  When you're growing the morning dew,
[27:41.180 --> 27:42.780]  you're gonna see some weirdos.
[27:42.780 --> 27:45.180]  Some of them start off kind of strange.
[27:45.180 --> 27:46.020]  Be patient.
[27:46.020 --> 27:47.300]  They grow right out of their weirdness.
[27:47.300 --> 27:49.060]  A lot of those morning dew weirdos,
[27:49.060 --> 27:50.420]  they snap out of it and they turn
[27:50.420 --> 27:52.320]  into beautiful, amazing plants.
[27:52.320 --> 27:54.160]  So if you've got some weird shit happening
[27:54.160 --> 27:56.900]  with your morning dew babies, have no fear.
[27:56.900 --> 27:58.020]  They will grow out of it.
[27:58.020 --> 27:59.660]  Sometimes we just have ugly babies.
[27:59.660 --> 28:00.820]  Not all babies are beautiful.
[28:00.820 --> 28:02.460]  I'm just kidding, you guys.
[28:02.460 --> 28:03.540]  They'll grow right out of it though.
[28:03.540 --> 28:05.180]  All right, that is all I've got for that episode.
[28:05.180 --> 28:09.100]  I think that's all for that message and for this episode.
[28:09.100 --> 28:10.780]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments,
[28:10.820 --> 28:12.940]  or concerns, you know that I would love to hear from you.
[28:12.940 --> 28:14.120]  The email address, of course,

[28:19.140 --> 28:22.220]  the comments, corrections, feedback, constructive criticism.
[28:22.220 --> 28:23.260]  It is welcomed.
[28:23.260 --> 28:24.360]  Don't be shy.

[29:17.000 --> 29:18.700]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps,
[29:18.700 --> 29:20.780]  hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[29:20.780 --> 29:22.740]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[29:22.740 --> 29:24.780]  all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts,
[29:24.780 --> 29:26.560]  amazing cannabis activists out there,
[29:26.560 --> 29:28.340]  I wanna thank you once again for listening
[29:28.340 --> 29:32.940]  to episode 698 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[29:32.940 --> 29:33.780]  I say it all the time.
[29:33.780 --> 29:38.180]  It blows my mind when I talk about 698 episodes.
[29:39.020 --> 29:39.860]  That is amazing to me.
[29:39.860 --> 29:40.900]  Number 700 is coming up.
[29:40.900 --> 29:44.340]  I don't have anything special planned for number 700.
[29:44.340 --> 29:46.180]  High fives and fist bumps all around.
[29:46.180 --> 29:48.060]  However, I do have some things planned
[29:48.060 --> 29:49.960]  for episode number 710.
[29:49.960 --> 29:54.140]  I'm going to do my best to get a very well-known hash maker
[29:54.140 --> 29:56.260]  on the show to answer some hash questions.
[29:56.260 --> 29:58.220]  We'll have some friends from the Discord
[29:58.220 --> 29:59.640]  give us some questions.
[29:59.640 --> 30:03.060]  So episode 710 should feature a wonderful,
[30:03.060 --> 30:05.740]  kind of a well-known hash maker in these parts.
[30:05.740 --> 30:06.780]  If you've been hanging out for a while,
[30:06.780 --> 30:08.500]  you might know who I'm talking about already.
[30:08.500 --> 30:11.620]  Don't wanna drop any names because it has not been confirmed
[30:11.620 --> 30:14.140]  but once I confirm, I'll tell you all about
[30:14.140 --> 30:16.840]  who's gonna be on the show here for the 710 episode.
[30:16.840 --> 30:18.580]  We're gonna talk about concentrates on 710.
[30:18.580 --> 30:20.220]  If you don't know what 710 is about,
[30:20.220 --> 30:21.660]  you've got 12 episodes.
[30:21.660 --> 30:23.440]  You're gonna learn something today.
[30:23.440 --> 30:25.060]  All right, that is all I've got for this episode.
[30:25.060 --> 30:26.700]  I'm gonna get out of here before I keep rambling
[30:26.700 --> 30:28.420]  and make this a nine-hour show.
[30:28.420 --> 30:29.820]  Thank you again for listening.
[30:29.820 --> 30:32.940]  Let's give a big shout out to my buddy Sam Heads.
[30:32.940 --> 30:33.860]  And until next time,
[30:33.860 --> 30:36.800]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
