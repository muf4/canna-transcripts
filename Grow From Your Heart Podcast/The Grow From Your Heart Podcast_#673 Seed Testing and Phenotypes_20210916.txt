[00:19.450 --> 00:21.130]  Alright, here we go.
[00:21.130 --> 00:22.530]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:22.530 --> 00:29.210]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 673 of the Grow From Your
[00:29.210 --> 00:30.890]  Heart Podcast.
[00:30.890 --> 00:34.210]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of Patreon questions.
[00:34.210 --> 00:37.890]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shoutouts to a few of those great
[00:37.890 --> 00:41.210]  folks who support the show on Patreon.
[00:41.210 --> 00:44.850]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shoutout to my friend
[00:44.850 --> 00:46.350]  Justa Smokin'.
[00:46.350 --> 00:50.110]  Let's send a big thank you shoutout to Root305 and Elders Garden.
[00:50.110 --> 00:54.510]  Let's send a Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shoutout to BigSexyDank and 716
[00:54.510 --> 00:55.510]  Grows.
[00:55.510 --> 00:59.770]  I want to send a thank you shoutout to a long time supporter, Nomi by my guacamole.
[00:59.770 --> 01:02.510]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shoutout to Jackie Daytona.
[01:02.510 --> 01:06.830]  I want to send a special thank you shoutout to StashDrop269.
[01:06.830 --> 01:10.990]  Let's send a big fist bump to my buddy Mr. Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow
[01:10.990 --> 01:15.530]  From Your Heart Podcast thank you shoutout to Terp Burglar.
[01:15.530 --> 01:20.430]  Big thanks and big shoutout to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:20.430 --> 01:24.290]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:24.290 --> 01:30.890]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:30.890 --> 01:34.810]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen and you know I do include a
[01:34.810 --> 01:40.970]  link in the show notes and the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:40.970 --> 01:46.250]  I do want to send a special thank you shoutout to all 200 of my Patreon supporters.
[01:46.250 --> 01:49.010]  We've been hovering right around 200 patrons lately.
[01:49.010 --> 01:50.170]  I do appreciate it.
[01:50.170 --> 01:51.170]  That means a lot to me.
[01:51.170 --> 01:52.530]  It does not go unnoticed.
[01:52.530 --> 01:53.530]  I enjoy it.
[01:53.530 --> 01:54.610]  I appreciate it.
[01:54.610 --> 02:00.250]  Sometimes it's a bit overwhelming but big salute, big fist bump, thank you for all of
[02:00.250 --> 02:01.650]  that support.
[02:01.650 --> 02:05.290]  Now this is the part where I do invite you to join us on Discord.
[02:05.290 --> 02:09.650]  That's right the Discord server has reached over 1400 members.
[02:09.650 --> 02:12.250]  In the last episode I said we hit 1200.
[02:12.250 --> 02:16.570]  We are already to 1400 members on the Discord server.
[02:16.570 --> 02:19.050]  There are a lot of great things happening over on Discord.
[02:19.050 --> 02:20.050]  I always say it.
[02:20.050 --> 02:22.090]  There's a video chat where people are hanging out.
[02:22.090 --> 02:24.450]  They've added a sports chat channel.
[02:24.450 --> 02:28.250]  If you are watching sports, if you're watching basketball, hockey, football, golf, whatever
[02:28.250 --> 02:32.190]  is on your TV, if you're smoking a bowl and watching sports and you want someone to hang
[02:32.190 --> 02:35.330]  out with, go to the iRegenetics Discord.
[02:35.330 --> 02:37.450]  Look for the sports chat server.
[02:37.450 --> 02:38.450]  Click on there.
[02:38.450 --> 02:39.450]  You can hang out.
[02:40.250 --> 02:41.690]  You can be on the voice chat or you can be on the video chat.
[02:41.690 --> 02:42.690]  Hang out, smoke with the crew.
[02:42.690 --> 02:47.090]  There are a lot of cool people hanging out over there, especially on game day during
[02:47.090 --> 02:49.530]  a big game, rooting for their team.
[02:49.530 --> 02:50.530]  It's all friendly.
[02:50.530 --> 02:53.190]  Go root for your team in the Discord server.
[02:53.190 --> 02:58.690]  The last time I jumped in the Discord server, I let the crew help me design new merchandise.
[02:58.690 --> 03:02.490]  I was working on a couple of designs for some new merch that I'll talk about in a future
[03:02.490 --> 03:05.490]  episode, but I wanted some feedback and some input.
[03:05.490 --> 03:06.850]  So I went to the Discord.
[03:06.850 --> 03:11.170]  I posted a picture of the merchandise that I had in mind and I said, give me feedback.
[03:11.170 --> 03:12.170]  Give me info.
[03:12.170 --> 03:13.170]  Give me details.
[03:13.170 --> 03:14.170]  Give me updates.
[03:14.170 --> 03:18.370]  I got a lot of great feedback and I compiled some of the crowd's input and feedback into
[03:18.370 --> 03:19.370]  a beautiful design.
[03:19.370 --> 03:24.430]  So there'll be some great merchandise that was partially designed by the Discord crew.
[03:24.430 --> 03:28.330]  So if you're hanging out in the Discord, you may get the opportunity to help us design
[03:28.330 --> 03:30.610]  new merchandise, name new strains.
[03:30.610 --> 03:34.570]  You can be involved in a lot of great shit if you join us on the Discord server.
[03:34.570 --> 03:38.770]  Of course, there is a link in the show notes and the video description and I'll type the
[03:38.770 --> 03:39.770]  link right here.
[03:39.770 --> 03:42.450]  You can't click on it, but you can at least read that.
[03:42.450 --> 03:44.090]  Type that into your URL.
[03:44.090 --> 03:46.610]  Join us on the Discord server.
[03:46.610 --> 03:50.730]  Once again, big thanks to everybody who's hanging out on the Discord server.
[03:50.730 --> 03:55.850]  I did mention that we designed some new merchandise on the website, iregenetics.com.
[03:55.850 --> 03:59.770]  There is a store to the, there is a link to the IRE store.
[03:59.770 --> 04:03.170]  Click on that link that will take you to the IRE store where the IRE genetics merchandise
[04:03.170 --> 04:05.770]  is available for the podcast listeners.
[04:05.770 --> 04:09.330]  I have created the coupon code, podcast10.
[04:09.330 --> 04:13.850]  That coupon code is good at the IRE merch store where you can get the shirts, the stickers,
[04:13.850 --> 04:14.850]  the coffee cups.
[04:14.850 --> 04:16.090]  There are grinders there.
[04:16.090 --> 04:17.650]  There are rolling trays there.
[04:17.650 --> 04:21.250]  There are a few other pieces of merchandise that are coming, but COVID has us slowed down
[04:21.250 --> 04:22.250]  a little bit.
[04:22.250 --> 04:26.170]  When those items do arrive, I'll send out the MailChimp newsletter, let you know they're
[04:26.170 --> 04:27.170]  there.
[04:27.170 --> 04:29.530]  I'll add them to the store right away, make them available for the crew.
[04:29.530 --> 04:32.390]  But don't miss it on iregenetics.com.
[04:32.610 --> 04:35.630]  Click on the store link to use coupon code podcast10.
[04:35.630 --> 04:39.670]  That will save you 10% off everything in the web store.
[04:39.670 --> 04:43.630]  All right, I do have some real topics here that we want to get into.
[04:43.630 --> 04:48.070]  I have been doing, I don't talk about it a lot because I try to keep some projects secret
[04:48.070 --> 04:50.270]  until I see a little bit of success.
[04:50.270 --> 04:53.990]  I feel like if I talk about things a little bit too early, it gives me the opportunity
[04:53.990 --> 04:54.990]  to fail.
[04:54.990 --> 04:57.870]  And then I've got to talk about failures, which is never fun.
[04:57.870 --> 05:01.470]  But maybe I should mention, even though I'm a professional grower that has done a lot
[05:01.550 --> 05:05.030]  of shit, sometimes I still fail and it's okay to fuck up and fail.
[05:05.030 --> 05:06.030]  Let it humble you.
[05:06.030 --> 05:07.950]  But let's get myself back on track.
[05:07.950 --> 05:11.030]  I am talking about an outdoor garden that I've been playing in.
[05:11.030 --> 05:12.950]  I did some outdoor breeding.
[05:12.950 --> 05:13.950]  I had some help.
[05:13.950 --> 05:14.950]  It was not just me.
[05:14.950 --> 05:16.390]  I don't want to take all of the credit.
[05:16.390 --> 05:18.990]  Big shout out to the team that worked outdoors this year.
[05:18.990 --> 05:19.990]  They know who they are.
[05:19.990 --> 05:22.790]  They may not want their name set here on the show at this time.
[05:22.790 --> 05:25.870]  We'll talk about them and introduce them in the future if they want that.
[05:25.870 --> 05:27.310]  But a big shout out.
[05:27.310 --> 05:29.510]  Thank you for the help and for the work and for the space.
[05:29.510 --> 05:31.030]  But we've got some outdoor space going.
[05:31.590 --> 05:33.070]  It's actually a beautiful greenhouse.
[05:33.070 --> 05:37.870]  I took a few plants to the greenhouse and I may have taken King Solomon out there and
[05:37.870 --> 05:39.790]  he may have done some work.
[05:39.790 --> 05:40.790]  That's right.
[05:40.790 --> 05:45.390]  I did some outdoor breeding or some greenhouse breeding and something I learned that those
[05:45.390 --> 05:47.830]  seeds developed quickly.
[05:47.830 --> 05:50.110]  Outdoor breeding happens really fast.
[05:50.110 --> 05:52.230]  I was not expecting it.
[05:52.230 --> 05:53.230]  It's a good thing.
[05:53.230 --> 05:55.550]  The seeds will be done earlier than anticipated.
[05:55.550 --> 05:58.710]  The pollination happened much earlier than anticipated.
[05:58.710 --> 06:03.590]  I learned a lot this year and I'm very excited to have added outdoor breeding to my list
[06:03.590 --> 06:06.730]  of skills that I feel comfortable doing.
[06:06.730 --> 06:08.870]  This year was our inaugural run.
[06:08.870 --> 06:10.310]  But I had a good support team.
[06:10.310 --> 06:13.190]  I had friends that I could message and say, hey bro, I'm going to breed outside.
[06:13.190 --> 06:14.350]  Any advice?
[06:14.350 --> 06:15.550]  Big shout out to Jesse.
[06:15.550 --> 06:20.910]  He sent me a paragraph of oddly spelled, weirdly punctuated shit and taught me how to grow
[06:20.910 --> 06:22.310]  outdoors and breed outdoors.
[06:22.310 --> 06:23.710]  Jesse, I'm just picking on you, brother.
[06:23.710 --> 06:24.710]  Nothing but love.
[06:24.710 --> 06:26.590]  He can build a house, you guys.
[06:26.590 --> 06:28.550]  But Jesse gave me some great advice.
[06:29.390 --> 06:34.710]  Again, with Jesse's advice, my lead and our crew's hard work and effort, we have got some
[06:34.710 --> 06:37.150]  seeds that will be ready here.
[06:37.150 --> 06:40.630]  Hopefully they'll be done by ... I'm not even going to give myself a deadline, but around
[06:40.630 --> 06:44.990]  the Halloween time, we'll be cleaning up seeds, making packages, getting that stuff ready
[06:44.990 --> 06:47.070]  for possibly the Indo Expo.
[06:47.070 --> 06:51.130]  I did mention that the Indo Expo is kind of up in the air at this point.
[06:51.130 --> 06:55.710]  It's been a week since I've recorded and I have not ... Oh, excuse me for that.
[06:55.710 --> 06:59.350]  It has been a week since I recorded and I have not received any updates on the Indo
[06:59.350 --> 07:00.350]  Expo.
[07:00.350 --> 07:03.790]  Once again, as soon as I do receive an update on that, I will let you know.
[07:03.790 --> 07:07.990]  But there will be a bunch of fresh seeds and new crosses that you've never heard of, stuff
[07:07.990 --> 07:11.470]  I've never talked about will be available that came out of this greenhouse.
[07:11.470 --> 07:12.470]  Okay.
[07:12.470 --> 07:14.590]  I feel like I'm rambling because I'm very excited about the greenhouse.
[07:14.590 --> 07:18.070]  My point was that things are happening much more quickly in the greenhouse.
[07:18.070 --> 07:22.110]  The buds, it looked like I said, oh, this is where the buds are going to ... I was teaching
[07:22.110 --> 07:23.110]  somebody new.
[07:23.110 --> 07:24.350]  I said, these are where the buds are going to happen.
[07:24.350 --> 07:25.350]  This is how it's going to go.
[07:25.990 --> 07:27.310]  The next day I was like, well, there are all the buds.
[07:27.310 --> 07:28.310]  Holy shit.
[07:28.310 --> 07:30.270]  Then I showed them, this is where we pollinated.
[07:30.270 --> 07:31.430]  Here's the start of buds.
[07:31.430 --> 07:34.110]  The next day I was like, holy shit, there are all the seeds.
[07:34.110 --> 07:36.590]  It went really quickly outdoors.
[07:36.590 --> 07:37.590]  I was amazed.
[07:37.590 --> 07:38.710]  I'm excited for next year.
[07:38.710 --> 07:42.150]  I'm already planning for the next year's outdoor breeding program.
[07:42.150 --> 07:44.150]  Got ideas and things I want to do.
[07:44.150 --> 07:45.630]  I get in over my head sometimes.
[07:45.630 --> 07:46.630]  All right.
[07:46.630 --> 07:48.910]  Let's focus now on some of these Patreon questions.
[07:48.910 --> 07:53.390]  I do have a couple of Patreon questions that came from the Patreon audience, obviously.
[07:53.430 --> 07:57.510]  The first Patreon question in this episode comes from our friend Zachary Yu.
[07:57.510 --> 07:59.270]  It is a good outdoor growing question.
[07:59.270 --> 08:01.990]  I feel like it's very applicable at this time of year.
[08:01.990 --> 08:03.910]  It goes a lot like this.
[08:03.910 --> 08:05.270]  I have eight plants.
[08:05.270 --> 08:07.990]  Four of them are the same strains started at the same time.
[08:07.990 --> 08:09.230]  That makes sense.
[08:09.230 --> 08:13.950]  Then there are two pairs of different strains started at the same time.
[08:13.950 --> 08:19.230]  One pair being Scarlet Begonias and another pair ... It doesn't say what the others are.
[08:19.230 --> 08:23.350]  Then it says, five plants that consist of three OGs, one Scarlet Begonia, one Otesis,
[08:23.350 --> 08:28.790]  a Sweet Cherry Pie, are in one area that is pretty heavy with sunlight consistently.
[08:28.790 --> 08:34.710]  They are behind the other three at another spot in regards to flowering speed, but the
[08:34.710 --> 08:39.390]  three of the same strain and the same area are flowering at different rates.
[08:39.390 --> 08:44.470]  Can this be summed up to being simple as different phenotypes or something I cannot even think
[08:44.470 --> 08:45.470]  of?
[08:45.470 --> 08:49.990]  The question here is he's got several plants and they're acting different outdoors.
[08:49.990 --> 08:52.510]  He's got some in one area and some in another area.
[08:52.670 --> 08:57.270]  The plants in the same area are showing different expressions.
[08:57.270 --> 08:58.270]  They're the same strain.
[08:58.270 --> 09:02.110]  They all came from the same package of seeds, but they're showing different stuff.
[09:02.110 --> 09:03.190]  Yes, my friend.
[09:03.190 --> 09:07.550]  That is a perfect example of phenotypical expression.
[09:07.550 --> 09:09.990]  Just think about it.
[09:09.990 --> 09:10.990]  Let's talk about two parents.
[09:10.990 --> 09:12.470]  I'm going to pick anybody's parents.
[09:12.470 --> 09:14.870]  Maybe yours, maybe not if you don't want it to be.
[09:14.870 --> 09:16.990]  Let's talk about two parents, two breeding parents.
[09:16.990 --> 09:18.750]  They made three babies.
[09:18.750 --> 09:20.510]  Let's talk about a family with three kids.
[09:20.510 --> 09:22.710]  You may have one tall, skinny kid.
[09:22.710 --> 09:23.710]  That would be me.
[09:23.710 --> 09:25.930]  You may have one short, chunkier kid.
[09:25.930 --> 09:26.930]  That might not be me.
[09:26.930 --> 09:30.470]  Then you may have one that is weirdly shaped in the middle.
[09:30.470 --> 09:32.330]  One kid may be really athletic.
[09:32.330 --> 09:34.230]  One kid may not be athletic at all.
[09:34.230 --> 09:35.690]  One may be really aggressive.
[09:35.690 --> 09:39.830]  One may be really passive, but you came from the same parents and you grew up in the same
[09:39.830 --> 09:40.910]  exact environment.
[09:40.910 --> 09:43.190]  Those are just phenotypical expressions.
[09:43.190 --> 09:45.310]  The plants do very similar things.
[09:45.310 --> 09:48.790]  You're going to see that variation, that expression in the plants.
[09:49.070 --> 09:54.030]  It would be very interesting on a totally different experiment to take clones and put
[09:54.030 --> 09:59.710]  a clone of the same plant in your two different grow locations and see what they do there.
[09:59.710 --> 10:04.430]  What I definitely think is happening is that you are seeing phenotypical variation.
[10:04.430 --> 10:09.750]  If you've got a pack of seeds and you've got four of the same plant in one area, they look
[10:09.750 --> 10:10.750]  different.
[10:10.750 --> 10:12.990]  I do believe that is just phenotypical variation.
[10:12.990 --> 10:16.590]  I'm going to read the question here and make sure I answered that correctly.
[10:16.590 --> 10:18.350]  There is another part that I do want to touch on.
[10:18.910 --> 10:23.070]  You said that they are behind in flowering compared to plants, the same type of plants
[10:23.070 --> 10:24.910]  in another area.
[10:24.910 --> 10:27.470]  That is another part of phenotypical expression.
[10:27.470 --> 10:29.390]  Maybe that one area is getting more light.
[10:29.390 --> 10:31.850]  Maybe it's getting less light, longer light.
[10:31.850 --> 10:33.430]  Maybe something is blocking the light.
[10:33.430 --> 10:34.950]  Maybe it's shaded.
[10:34.950 --> 10:37.230]  Maybe the temperature is just a little bit different over there.
[10:37.230 --> 10:41.390]  Maybe the soil is a little bit different, but that shows us how just a little bit of
[10:41.390 --> 10:45.030]  difference in environment can change the plants drastically.
[10:45.030 --> 10:49.150]  They're further behind each other or further ahead each other in flower just because of
[10:49.150 --> 10:50.870]  the environment in which they are in.
[10:50.870 --> 10:53.030]  That is a very good example.
[10:53.030 --> 10:56.550]  Most of what you are seeing here is phenotypical expression.
[10:56.550 --> 11:01.470]  I guess all of it is phenotypical expression, even if it is the environment making it happen
[11:01.470 --> 11:03.910]  because that's what phenotypical expression is.
[11:03.910 --> 11:09.590]  It's showing different traits based on your environment expressing different things.
[11:09.590 --> 11:12.390]  That's what you've got going on there.
[11:12.390 --> 11:15.270]  Good foresight, good prediction, good hypothesis.
[11:15.270 --> 11:16.450]  I do agree with you, buddy.
[11:16.450 --> 11:20.030]  That is just basic phenotypical expression.
[11:20.030 --> 11:23.150]  Big shout out to my buddy Zachary Yu for the great message.
[11:23.150 --> 11:24.510]  Keep them growing, bro.
[11:24.510 --> 11:28.750]  Since you said you've got some iReed genetics outdoors, where are my photos, bro?
[11:28.750 --> 11:30.550]  Pictures, or it didn't happen.
[11:30.550 --> 11:33.990]  If you guys are growing iReed genetics, I would love to see your photos.
[11:33.990 --> 11:39.710]  Send me photos of my strains at any stage of growth, veg, flower, big buds, little buds,
[11:39.870 --> 11:43.510]  anything you want to share, anything you think I might want to post to social media, anything
[11:43.510 --> 11:46.230]  you want me to share to social media, send it to me.
[11:46.230 --> 11:51.830]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com or just forward it right over to me on Instagram.
[11:51.830 --> 11:56.630]  It's iReed underscore genetics on Instagram, iR-I-E underscore genetics.
[11:56.630 --> 12:00.590]  I hope you can spell genetics, iReed underscore genetics on Instagram.
[12:00.590 --> 12:01.590]  Just shoot me your photos.
[12:01.590 --> 12:02.590]  Excuse me.
[12:02.590 --> 12:04.310]  Just shoot me your photos.
[12:04.310 --> 12:06.790]  If you want them shared, let me know you want them shared.
[12:06.790 --> 12:08.410]  If you want credit, let me know you want credit.
[12:08.410 --> 12:12.130]  If you don't want credit, let me know because most of the time I just automatically will
[12:12.130 --> 12:13.130]  give you credit.
[12:13.130 --> 12:16.250]  I'll be like, here's a picture of Scarlet begonias grown by Zachary Yu.
[12:16.250 --> 12:18.730]  Post it up, put it in my stories, save it to the highlights.
[12:18.730 --> 12:20.490]  It'll be up there for a long time.
[12:20.490 --> 12:21.490]  Let me know.
[12:21.490 --> 12:24.650]  Also, we need some photos for the website, so don't be afraid to send me photos.
[12:24.650 --> 12:25.650]  I enjoy photos.
[12:25.650 --> 12:29.890]  All right, let me get myself back on track, get back in a little bit of focus here because
[12:29.890 --> 12:32.370]  I do have another great message in front of me.
[12:32.370 --> 12:34.810]  This one comes from our friend Rasta Bot.
[12:34.810 --> 12:38.050]  We mentioned Rasta Bot last week when we were talking about Discord.
[12:38.690 --> 12:41.370]  Rasta Bot, big thank you for all of the dedication on the Discord server.
[12:41.370 --> 12:45.210]  The Discord gang always tells me, bro, we don't need shout outs, we don't need love,
[12:45.210 --> 12:47.930]  we don't need high fives, but you guys do so much work.
[12:47.930 --> 12:53.630]  I cannot believe the dedication and commitment to the Discord server by the Discord team.
[12:53.630 --> 12:54.630]  Big shout out.
[12:54.630 --> 12:55.630]  Thank you guys.
[12:55.630 --> 12:56.630]  I appreciate it.
[12:56.630 --> 12:59.530]  There are 1,400 people hanging out because a few people decided they would build a Discord
[12:59.530 --> 13:00.570]  for me.
[13:00.570 --> 13:01.570]  Thank you.
[13:01.570 --> 13:02.570]  It blows my mind, you guys.
[13:02.570 --> 13:07.210]  The support that I get from the Iry Army for this podcast for the seed brand, it still
[13:07.370 --> 13:08.370]  blows my mind.
[13:08.370 --> 13:09.370]  It's humbling.
[13:09.370 --> 13:10.370]  It makes me feel great.
[13:10.370 --> 13:11.370]  It makes me feel nervous.
[13:11.370 --> 13:13.370]  It's overwhelming in the best way.
[13:13.370 --> 13:14.370]  I love it.
[13:14.370 --> 13:15.370]  It's inspiring.
[13:15.370 --> 13:16.370]  It's motivating.
[13:16.370 --> 13:17.930]  It makes me feel like a superhero.
[13:17.930 --> 13:19.490]  It gives me a lot of great feelings.
[13:19.490 --> 13:23.970]  There's a lot of pride, but also there are a lot of people that I cannot let down, which
[13:23.970 --> 13:27.090]  is a great yet scary feeling in a good way.
[13:27.090 --> 13:28.290]  Don't ever stop doing what you're doing, guys.
[13:28.290 --> 13:29.290]  I do love it.
[13:29.290 --> 13:33.770]  All right, from Rasta Bot, this one says, hey, Rasta Jeff, I've been loving the breeding
[13:33.770 --> 13:35.310]  talk you've been doing lately.
[13:35.310 --> 13:36.310]  Thank you, bro.
[13:36.410 --> 13:37.410]  I love to talk about breeding.
[13:37.410 --> 13:40.070]  If you have specific breeding questions, please do send them.
[13:40.070 --> 13:41.550]  I like specific questions.
[13:41.550 --> 13:45.230]  It gets me more focused on my rambles because I do get rambly, if you haven't noticed on
[13:45.230 --> 13:46.230]  this episode.
[13:46.230 --> 13:50.030]  It goes on to say, my mind was wandering during your latest episode.
[13:50.030 --> 13:51.030]  Thanks, bro.
[13:51.030 --> 13:52.030]  Mine probably was too.
[13:52.030 --> 13:54.470]  It says, I thought of a couple related questions.
[13:54.470 --> 13:58.910]  When you breed, how often do you retest your seeds?
[13:58.910 --> 14:00.370]  That is a very good question.
[14:00.370 --> 14:05.490]  Being a person who breeds for commercial purposes, my seeds are on the market through several
[14:05.670 --> 14:06.670]  different avenues.
[14:06.670 --> 14:10.970]  It is a good idea that I do keep up my quality control standards.
[14:10.970 --> 14:11.970]  That is a very good question.
[14:11.970 --> 14:14.490]  I do appreciate you checking me on that.
[14:14.490 --> 14:17.490]  A lot of people go unchecked and they forget to check.
[14:17.490 --> 14:20.330]  Thank you for checking on me.
[14:20.330 --> 14:21.330]  It goes on.
[14:21.330 --> 14:26.370]  It says, if you make 1,000 seeds and that batch passes the test, do you retest the next
[14:26.370 --> 14:28.610]  time you make a batch?
[14:28.610 --> 14:29.970]  We'll make a lot of seeds.
[14:29.970 --> 14:31.050]  We'll make 1,000 seeds.
[14:31.050 --> 14:32.050]  We'll test them.
[14:32.050 --> 14:34.450]  You guys get to see most of the testing.
[14:34.450 --> 14:36.490]  I try to keep it fairly transparent.
[14:36.490 --> 14:40.450]  I have a lot of testers who are on social media, but I also have testers who are not
[14:40.450 --> 14:41.490]  on social media.
[14:41.490 --> 14:43.490]  You see the folks who are.
[14:43.490 --> 14:46.610]  You see ZosoJ post every moment of the grow.
[14:46.610 --> 14:51.410]  You get to see from the sprout all the way up in fucking time lapse video.
[14:51.410 --> 14:53.290]  Who else does a great job?
[14:53.290 --> 14:54.850]  All Mixed Up does a good job.
[14:54.850 --> 14:56.410]  Rosinman does a good job.
[14:56.410 --> 14:57.810]  Mobius Grows does a great job.
[14:57.810 --> 15:00.090]  They post all that stuff to social media.
[15:00.090 --> 15:01.890]  Big shout out to all the testers who I didn't mention.
[15:01.890 --> 15:02.890]  That was enough.
[15:02.890 --> 15:03.890]  Sorry.
[15:04.330 --> 15:05.330]  It's not an award show.
[15:05.330 --> 15:08.890]  We're not going to shout out everybody in the gang, but all the testers post their stuff
[15:08.890 --> 15:11.170]  up on social media and you guys get to see it.
[15:11.170 --> 15:13.170]  You get to see that initial testing.
[15:13.170 --> 15:14.450]  How does it look?
[15:14.450 --> 15:15.450]  Is the structure good?
[15:15.450 --> 15:16.650]  What are the leaf shape like?
[15:16.650 --> 15:17.730]  What is the bud shape like?
[15:17.730 --> 15:19.210]  Are there any cool colors?
[15:19.210 --> 15:22.210]  A lot of times we see if there are any problems through those testers.
[15:22.210 --> 15:23.890]  They'll show us were there any issues.
[15:23.890 --> 15:28.810]  Luckily, most of the time there are no issues, but like all things, shit does happen.
[15:28.810 --> 15:29.930]  Get a lot of testers going.
[15:29.930 --> 15:31.250]  They send me test reports.
[15:31.250 --> 15:32.730]  Then we decide if we want to release it.
[15:33.730 --> 15:38.850]  Then right before it's sold out or sometimes unfortunately just after it sells out, I decide
[15:38.850 --> 15:42.370]  I need to make more and restock that strain.
[15:42.370 --> 15:44.250]  Here's where your question really comes into play.
[15:44.250 --> 15:45.730]  Do I test this next batch?
[15:45.730 --> 15:47.130]  I'll do the pollen chucking.
[15:47.130 --> 15:49.290]  I'll make the male plant and the female plant do their magic.
[15:49.290 --> 15:50.730]  I'll get the seeds out of there.
[15:50.730 --> 15:54.930]  I generally will do a solid germination test.
[15:54.930 --> 15:57.490]  I don't even know how many seeds fit in the palm of my hand.
[15:57.490 --> 15:59.610]  It's probably about 40 or 50 seeds.
[15:59.610 --> 16:01.810]  I just do the paper towel germination test.
[16:01.850 --> 16:04.850]  I fold up a paper towel a lot like I do this piece of paper.
[16:04.850 --> 16:07.970]  Fold it up, soak it with water, throw the seeds right in the middle there, leave them
[16:07.970 --> 16:08.970]  on the table.
[16:08.970 --> 16:11.810]  They don't get any special treatment, but I do make sure they're wet.
[16:11.810 --> 16:14.130]  I do check on them every few hours.
[16:14.130 --> 16:16.810]  Then I open it up to see how many of those seeds germinated.
[16:16.810 --> 16:19.250]  That is one of my main concerns at this point.
[16:19.250 --> 16:24.410]  If they are germinating, they're healthy seeds, they flower long enough, they finished.
[16:24.410 --> 16:25.930]  Most of the time I can tell that by squeezing them.
[16:25.930 --> 16:26.930]  I push them on the table.
[16:26.930 --> 16:27.930]  They're hard.
[16:27.930 --> 16:30.610]  If it hurts my finger, it makes a dent, the seeds are ready.
[16:30.610 --> 16:31.610]  So I germinate them.
[16:32.410 --> 16:33.410]  I make sure they sprout.
[16:33.410 --> 16:35.410]  If they're sprouting, I'm mostly confident in them.
[16:35.410 --> 16:39.050]  Then we'll send a few of those out as freebies to the friends and they'll grow them and they'll
[16:39.050 --> 16:40.050]  know what they've got.
[16:40.050 --> 16:42.330]  I'll be like, hey, run these real quick and they'll just run them and then we can see
[16:42.330 --> 16:43.330]  what they've got.
[16:43.330 --> 16:48.090]  I don't really do, honestly, rigorous, vigorous retesting.
[16:48.090 --> 16:53.450]  As long as those mother plants and father plant weren't ruined, destroyed, compromised
[16:53.450 --> 16:55.190]  is the word I'm seeking in my head.
[16:55.190 --> 16:58.890]  As long as there was no compromisation of the parent plants, I feel like the genetics
[16:58.890 --> 17:00.450]  are exactly the same.
[17:00.450 --> 17:02.370]  The breeding will happen exactly the same.
[17:02.370 --> 17:04.210]  The phenotypes are going to be the same.
[17:04.210 --> 17:10.170]  I didn't put any other, there's no other ingredients in my recipe, so there should not be any variation.
[17:10.170 --> 17:17.850]  Again, if my parent plants remain uncompromised, if there was no compromised health, no stress,
[17:17.850 --> 17:22.330]  no light weirdness, no nutrient problems, anything like that, then it should be the
[17:22.330 --> 17:23.330]  same.
[17:23.330 --> 17:26.850]  There's no scientific, biological reason why I would get variation.
[17:26.850 --> 17:30.610]  Maybe some epigenetics or something like that may cause something, but I think it would
[17:30.610 --> 17:33.770]  take much longer than what I'm able to do with these plants.
[17:33.770 --> 17:36.730]  I haven't had them for hundreds of years.
[17:36.730 --> 17:41.410]  I don't do rigorous, vigorous retesting of the crosses too deeply.
[17:41.410 --> 17:43.530]  I do retest for germination rates.
[17:43.530 --> 17:45.730]  I test every batch of seeds for germ rates.
[17:45.730 --> 17:48.250]  We want to know that every batch of seeds is good.
[17:48.250 --> 17:52.490]  If I make a batch, there's 1,000 seeds in there, 50 to 100 of them just go strictly
[17:52.490 --> 17:54.290]  just to germination.
[17:54.290 --> 17:58.410]  We'll pull a few of those out if we've got room to keep them and grow those.
[17:58.410 --> 17:59.410]  Most of the time that's how it works.
[17:59.410 --> 18:04.090]  You germ like 50 of them, I pick fucking 25 of them, grow those, find 10 or 12 females
[18:04.090 --> 18:06.210]  in there, take pictures of all those, have good documentation.
[18:06.210 --> 18:11.810]  That's how it usually goes, but the second time around I don't really do vigorous testing.
[18:11.810 --> 18:12.810]  I send them out to the crew.
[18:12.810 --> 18:18.170]  I say, hey, Rosinman, hey, Mobius, hey, somebody, these are a remake.
[18:18.170 --> 18:19.170]  Can you give me a quick run?
[18:19.170 --> 18:20.170]  Or I grow them myself.
[18:20.170 --> 18:22.990]  I'll just grow a few, and I can tell quickly.
[18:22.990 --> 18:23.990]  They're my kids.
[18:24.690 --> 18:27.390]  They'll grow up quite quickly if they're going to be worth a shit or not.
[18:27.390 --> 18:31.710]  Then it wraps up with not looking to have you do a quality control test on the air,
[18:31.710 --> 18:38.230]  just more wondering how different breeding is between the same cuts over time and years.
[18:38.230 --> 18:41.830]  In my experience, I have not noticed any change in the breeding.
[18:41.830 --> 18:47.390]  I'm pretty good at identifying the offspring, the phenotypes from my crosses, and I don't
[18:47.390 --> 18:54.070]  see any difference, any shift, any degradation, any weird evolution in my breeding.
[18:54.070 --> 18:57.350]  I think it all looks just the same.
[18:57.350 --> 18:59.470]  I think I'd have to have the plants for quite a bit longer.
[18:59.470 --> 19:02.830]  I think I'd have to be doing it for quite a bit longer for the plants to build up any
[19:02.830 --> 19:07.390]  memory, unless I started breeding with sick plants or something, which at that point I
[19:07.390 --> 19:08.390]  don't do.
[19:08.390 --> 19:10.990]  If the plants don't sustain health, if I can't keep them healthy, there's no need for them
[19:10.990 --> 19:13.750]  to stay in the garden because I can keep a plant.
[19:13.750 --> 19:15.990]  Basic health is fucking ... I'm really good at that.
[19:15.990 --> 19:17.710]  They look green and healthy all the time.
[19:17.710 --> 19:20.830]  So yeah, if they're not staying green in micro, they go bye-bye because they're a pain in
[19:20.830 --> 19:21.830]  the ass.
[19:21.830 --> 19:23.550]  I think I wrapped up your question.
[19:23.550 --> 19:24.670]  Let me give it a quick skim.
[19:24.670 --> 19:26.630]  There's not a lot to it.
[19:26.630 --> 19:29.030]  How often do you retest?
[19:29.030 --> 19:35.030]  Strict germination testing, strict first level testing, second batch, not serious on the
[19:35.030 --> 19:37.750]  retesting that much, but I do do germ tests.
[19:37.750 --> 19:39.550]  I think that covers it all.
[19:39.550 --> 19:43.110]  Before I wrap up this message, I do have one cool topic I can talk about pretty soon.
[19:43.110 --> 19:45.150]  I'm going to do some different testing.
[19:45.310 --> 19:48.990]  I just mentioned a minute ago that I'm doing some breeding outdoors.
[19:48.990 --> 19:54.830]  I have made some of the same crosses outdoors that I have made indoors, and I have not ever
[19:54.830 --> 19:59.350]  tested the outdoor grow yet, so I don't know what the outdoor progeny is going to look
[19:59.350 --> 20:00.350]  like.
[20:00.350 --> 20:05.150]  I need a couple of friends, a couple of testers that will run a batch of seeds made indoors
[20:05.150 --> 20:07.150]  and a batch of seeds made outdoors.
[20:07.150 --> 20:08.790]  I think I said that correctly.
[20:08.790 --> 20:13.790]  Take the indoor seeds and outdoor seeds, label them correctly, like plant A indoors, plant
[20:13.830 --> 20:17.670]  B outdoors, and run them all next to each other and see if there is any difference in
[20:17.670 --> 20:18.670]  there.
[20:18.670 --> 20:19.670]  I want to run a bunch.
[20:19.670 --> 20:21.190]  I want some friends to run a bunch.
[20:21.190 --> 20:24.870]  The experiments are fun when I do them, but I need more feedback as well.
[20:24.870 --> 20:30.090]  I'm going to see stuff, but under whichever lights I choose to use, in the summertime
[20:30.090 --> 20:32.450]  I use one kind of light, in the winter I use another.
[20:32.450 --> 20:36.550]  How do they respond under my lights, but also how do they react in your grow, and in Dave's
[20:36.550 --> 20:41.990]  grow, and in John's grow, and in Jack's grow, and Jill's grow, and Bill's grow, and everybody's
[20:41.990 --> 20:42.990]  grow.
[20:43.190 --> 20:48.230]  So, pretty soon we're going to get to test stuff that was made indoors right next to
[20:48.230 --> 20:52.550]  stuff that was made outdoors, because I recently bred some of the same stuff.
[20:52.550 --> 20:57.030]  Some of it's coming down from the indoor grow, and it's almost ready in the outdoor grow.
[20:57.030 --> 21:00.770]  Just ironically, did the same stuff at the same time, and we'll get to test those side
[21:00.770 --> 21:01.930]  by side.
[21:01.930 --> 21:05.430]  That is something I'm very curious about, new testing that will get to be done.
[21:05.430 --> 21:06.430]  So that was a good rant.
[21:06.430 --> 21:08.630]  That was a good side subject to get me going on.
[21:08.630 --> 21:09.910]  I do appreciate that.
[21:09.910 --> 21:14.630]  I'm really excited about the outdoor greenhouse grow this year, and I super cannot wait to
[21:14.630 --> 21:18.310]  grow the seeds that come from that, and see are they more vigorous?
[21:18.310 --> 21:19.710]  Are they any different?
[21:19.710 --> 21:21.310]  Is there any difference at all?
[21:21.310 --> 21:25.710]  I just know that we made a lot more seeds outdoors than we would have indoors, so that
[21:25.710 --> 21:28.630]  was the super cool part, and it seemed to happen super quickly.
[21:28.630 --> 21:30.950]  All right, I am off on a good ramble again.
[21:30.950 --> 21:33.350]  Let's reel me back in and get back on a podcast.
[21:33.350 --> 21:37.230]  My buddy Rasta Bot, dude, thank you for a great Patreon message.
[21:37.230 --> 21:39.870]  Thank you once again for all of the Discord work.
[21:39.870 --> 21:41.590]  Cannot wait to hang out with you on Discord.
[21:41.590 --> 21:45.190]  When I get done recording here, it does take quite a few minutes to load all the files
[21:45.190 --> 21:47.730]  from the computer onto the drive.
[21:47.730 --> 21:51.750]  As that happens, I go take a couple of dabs and hang out with the crew on Discord.
[21:51.750 --> 21:52.750]  Hope you're there, brother.
[21:52.750 --> 21:54.430]  If not, we'll catch you next time.
[21:54.430 --> 21:58.510]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers,
[21:58.510 --> 22:02.670]  growers, clone cutters, and pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
[22:02.670 --> 22:05.070]  out there, I'm going to wrap up this podcast now.
[22:05.070 --> 22:06.950]  This will be a quick Thursday episode.
[22:06.950 --> 22:08.590]  I want to do thank you once again.
[22:08.590 --> 22:09.590]  I do want to thank you.
[22:10.310 --> 22:12.830]  I don't even know what my brain said right there, but you know what I mean.
[22:12.830 --> 22:18.590]  I want to thank you once again for listening to episode 673 of the Grow From Your Heart
[22:18.590 --> 22:19.590]  podcast.
[22:19.590 --> 22:22.950]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, you know I would love to hear
[22:22.950 --> 22:23.950]  from you.
[22:23.950 --> 22:28.390]  The email address for the podcast is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[22:28.390 --> 22:29.390]  Don't be shy.
[22:29.390 --> 22:30.390]  Send me your feedback.
[22:30.390 --> 22:31.390]  Send me your details.
[22:31.390 --> 22:34.670]  Also, send me your iRegenetics grow pictures.
[22:34.670 --> 22:37.470]  I would love to see what you're growing, see how you're doing.
[22:37.470 --> 22:38.750]  Maybe we can give you some advice.
[22:38.910 --> 22:40.350]  Maybe we can share some of your picks.
[22:40.350 --> 22:43.270]  If you want them shared here on the podcast, let me know.
[22:43.270 --> 22:47.390]  I can start sharing your iRegenetics here on the show.
[22:47.390 --> 22:49.910]  That would be a fun addition to the podcast.
[22:49.910 --> 22:50.910]  Thank you for the idea.
[22:50.910 --> 22:52.350]  I'm glad you came up with that.
[22:52.350 --> 22:53.350]  That was really cool of you.
[22:53.350 --> 22:54.750]  What else do I got for you?
[22:54.750 --> 22:58.590]  This is the time of the podcast where I ask you to like and subscribe.
[22:58.590 --> 22:59.590]  Go to YouTube.
[22:59.590 --> 23:04.550]  If you're listening on an audio server, I do invite you to watch the videos on YouTube.
[23:04.550 --> 23:08.950]  There's a high quality 4K multi-cam video happening on YouTube right now that you may
[23:08.950 --> 23:10.190]  want to check out.
[23:10.190 --> 23:11.270]  Go to YouTube.
[23:11.270 --> 23:12.390]  Click subscribe.
[23:12.390 --> 23:14.030]  Click on the notification bell.
[23:14.030 --> 23:17.750]  That way every time I put out a new episode, you do get a notification.
[23:17.750 --> 23:20.270]  You never miss any of the content.
[23:20.270 --> 23:25.270]  Sometimes the audio servers seem to be a little bit delayed.
[23:25.270 --> 23:26.430]  Sometimes they miss some episodes.
[23:26.430 --> 23:27.870]  I have to repost them.
[23:27.870 --> 23:29.510]  I'm not making excuses.
[23:29.510 --> 23:31.190]  I am not super tech savvy.
[23:31.190 --> 23:32.710]  I don't know what happens.
[23:32.710 --> 23:36.790]  They're working on fixing all of the glitches on all of the audio feeds.
[23:36.790 --> 23:41.330]  I do my best to make sure that YouTube is updated every Monday.
[23:41.330 --> 23:44.270]  It's actually Sunday night into Monday at midnight.
[23:44.270 --> 23:48.230]  Every Thursday, or no, it's Wednesday into Thursday at midnight, I make sure to have
[23:48.230 --> 23:50.530]  the YouTube video posted.
[23:50.530 --> 23:53.710]  That has been the priority because honestly, I edit down the YouTube video.
[23:53.710 --> 23:55.390]  Then I pull the audio out of that.
[23:55.390 --> 23:57.110]  I've got to do the video first.
[23:57.110 --> 23:58.590]  It gets up there on YouTube.
[23:58.590 --> 24:01.230]  Then while it's posting, I do the audio video.
[24:01.230 --> 24:04.350]  Welcome, a little bit behind the scenes.
[24:04.350 --> 24:05.950]  Like and subscribe on YouTube.
[24:05.950 --> 24:06.950]  That was the point.
[24:06.950 --> 24:09.470]  Don't forget about the Discord server.
[24:09.470 --> 24:15.790]  Everything else is on the iRegenetics website at iRegenetics.com.
[24:15.790 --> 24:16.790]  That's all I've got for you.
[24:16.790 --> 24:18.990]  I feel like I've been rambling on for quite a bit.
[24:18.990 --> 24:21.190]  You know I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[24:21.190 --> 24:24.590]  I want to give a big shout out to my buddy, Jesse Grose.
[24:24.590 --> 24:28.070]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
