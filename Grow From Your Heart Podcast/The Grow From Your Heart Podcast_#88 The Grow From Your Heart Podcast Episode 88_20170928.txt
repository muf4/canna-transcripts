[00:17.150 --> 00:19.450]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.450 --> 00:22.390]  It's time for episode number 88 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:22.830 --> 00:26.950]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:26.950 --> 00:28.790]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:28.870 --> 00:30.670]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:31.070 --> 00:34.190]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who is just curious about the
[00:34.190 --> 00:37.990]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:38.550 --> 00:39.950]  I'm your host. They call me Ross DeJeff.
[00:39.970 --> 00:42.110]  I want to thank you guys for joining me as always.
[00:42.150 --> 00:44.790]  I want to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for letting
[00:44.790 --> 00:46.990]  me use their music on my show. Big thanks to Kat,
[00:47.830 --> 00:50.230]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew. Right now,
[00:50.250 --> 00:52.950]  you guys are listening to a song called the Doggy Dub off of the album,
[00:52.950 --> 00:53.870]  The Constant Struggle.
[00:54.150 --> 00:56.910]  Make sure you support the Mystic Roots and check out the album,
[00:56.910 --> 01:00.030]  The Constant Struggle. My favorite album from them is called Cali High.
[01:00.070 --> 01:02.310]  Make sure you check that out. How are you guys doing?
[01:02.330 --> 01:05.870]  I hope everyone's having a great week. I'm coming to you on a Wednesday.
[01:05.890 --> 01:09.590]  It is 7 10 in the evening. It's actually about 7 15,
[01:09.590 --> 01:12.950]  because you know what I did at 7 10. I had a nice little 7 10 session.
[01:13.350 --> 01:16.230]  I hope you guys all had a nice 7 10. I hope wherever you are,
[01:16.250 --> 01:18.110]  whatever you're doing, I hope you're loading up a bowl.
[01:18.110 --> 01:21.030]  I hope you're twisting up a joint. I hope you're packing up the vaporizer.
[01:21.270 --> 01:23.670]  Maybe you're eating an edible. I hope you're heating up the nail.
[01:23.670 --> 01:27.750]  I hope you're taking a dab with me. I hope that in some way, shape, or form,
[01:27.910 --> 01:31.350]  you are consuming some type of high grade, high quality,
[01:31.510 --> 01:34.910]  super delicious dank cannabis products with me right now. I hope so.
[01:35.630 --> 01:39.950]  Big shout out to whoever is smoking, token, dabbing, eating some edibles.
[01:40.030 --> 01:41.990]  Big shout out to everybody. I hope you guys are joining me.
[01:42.590 --> 01:45.830]  Hope it's organic. I hope it's clean. I hope it's fresh. All right.
[01:45.830 --> 01:47.750]  So I've got a couple of things I want to talk about.
[01:48.030 --> 01:51.990]  I want to take a minute to give a huge thank you to my friend, Sonny.
[01:52.230 --> 01:55.350]  Sonny sometimes listens to this show. I also want to thank Ravay,
[01:55.670 --> 01:57.950]  a couple other people that you guys probably have never heard of.
[01:58.350 --> 02:02.750]  I especially want to thank Donovan McNeely, Dan Lazzarini, Kenny Nicholson,
[02:03.470 --> 02:05.670]  Wayne D Herrera. The list just goes on and on.
[02:05.910 --> 02:09.310]  So I'll tell you what I'm talking about. Unfortunately, a couple of weeks ago,
[02:09.310 --> 02:12.710]  a good friend of mine by the name of Brian Ritchie, he passed away.
[02:12.710 --> 02:15.390]  He left this earth and he left us a little saddened.
[02:16.150 --> 02:20.790]  Brian was a great musician. Brian is probably, let's see,
[02:20.870 --> 02:24.710]  Brian was probably close to 40 years older than me. Pretty close.
[02:24.830 --> 02:28.430]  35 to 40 years older than myself. And I met Brian.
[02:28.670 --> 02:31.990]  I was a musician just starting out and I was playing in a club and Brian saw me
[02:31.990 --> 02:32.950]  play. And he said, young man,
[02:32.950 --> 02:36.710]  you've got a gift and my band needs a drummer and I'd like you to play with us.
[02:37.350 --> 02:39.270]  And you know, this old guy approaches me and asked me to play.
[02:39.270 --> 02:41.350]  I kind of thought I don't want to play with a bunch of old guys.
[02:41.350 --> 02:43.830]  I'm a young rock star, but for some reason I did it.
[02:43.830 --> 02:46.470]  Something in my heart said you should go play with these old guys and see what
[02:46.470 --> 02:49.990]  they're doing. And until I played with them, I was not a drummer.
[02:50.070 --> 02:53.390]  I was a guy with a drum set that was hitting drums with my friends.
[02:54.550 --> 02:58.950]  Brian and the band I joined with Brian turned me into a musician.
[02:59.350 --> 03:04.350]  I was not a musician until that point. Brian gave me musical career advice.
[03:04.750 --> 03:06.590]  Brian gave me stage advice.
[03:06.990 --> 03:09.910]  Brian taught me a lot about being a professional musician.
[03:09.910 --> 03:14.910]  Brian took me out of the bar mentality of playing as a bar musician,
[03:15.150 --> 03:17.430]  just playing for free beer, trying to be a rock star.
[03:17.430 --> 03:21.030]  He put me in the mentality and mindset of a working drummer.
[03:21.350 --> 03:22.670]  And I will never forget that.
[03:23.150 --> 03:26.390]  So I'm always grateful to Brian Ritchie for the,
[03:27.390 --> 03:29.830]  the what did he see in me? He had confidence in me.
[03:29.830 --> 03:33.950]  He had faith in me and he saw that and he put me behind the drums in his band
[03:33.950 --> 03:36.950]  when I wasn't ready and let me earn my position there.
[03:36.950 --> 03:38.830]  And I worked hard to be the drummer that he needed.
[03:38.830 --> 03:42.350]  So I've been going on for a long time about it, but Brian, I miss you, bro.
[03:42.430 --> 03:44.430]  Thanks for what you did to my musical career.
[03:44.430 --> 03:47.110]  Thanks for what you did to my mindset as a musician.
[03:47.550 --> 03:50.910]  Now what I'm getting to is Saturday, we threw a giant party.
[03:50.910 --> 03:53.990]  Brian didn't want a funeral because he didn't want sadness,
[03:54.310 --> 03:58.670]  but I thought that it was my duty to throw a party for the man and get all of our
[03:58.670 --> 04:03.670]  favorite mutual friends and musicians together in one room and play one night.
[04:03.950 --> 04:07.030]  One big jam and one last hurrah for our friend, Brian.
[04:07.750 --> 04:10.830]  So I organized an event in my friend's Sunny's house.
[04:10.830 --> 04:14.390]  He's got a large jam space with like a large jam room.
[04:14.390 --> 04:15.830]  His house is like a club.
[04:15.830 --> 04:18.590]  He's got a small club attached to the back of his house.
[04:19.070 --> 04:22.430]  So I made a Facebook event. I sent out a few phone calls, a few invites.
[04:22.430 --> 04:25.270]  I got our old band together, came and jammed.
[04:25.310 --> 04:28.630]  Another band that Brian was in came and jammed and a bunch of Brian's old
[04:28.630 --> 04:32.550]  friends came and played music. We had a potluck, big shout out to George Samaras.
[04:32.870 --> 04:34.990]  He brought a lot of great goodies. I appreciate that.
[04:35.270 --> 04:37.230]  Big shout to everybody who attended the party.
[04:37.470 --> 04:39.390]  Big shout out to everybody who played at the party.
[04:39.390 --> 04:42.070]  Big shout to Danielle for helping me organize the party.
[04:42.750 --> 04:46.190]  This party meant a lot to me and it was a complete success and I am totally
[04:46.190 --> 04:50.350]  satisfied and grateful and I wanted to share all of it with you guys and give a
[04:50.350 --> 04:53.710]  big thank you to everybody so everyone can hear it all at once.
[04:53.710 --> 04:56.270]  I hope you guys are listening. We'll move on. I'm sorry guys. I don't want to,
[04:56.470 --> 04:58.190]  I don't want to ramble about this party too much,
[04:58.190 --> 05:01.110]  but I was super excited and I feel like I wanted to thank everybody on the
[05:01.110 --> 05:03.590]  podcast publicly. So thank you guys. I appreciate it.
[05:04.190 --> 05:06.830]  It's good to know that I can put together a party like that.
[05:07.590 --> 05:11.310]  I only had about four or five days to organize and I got about 80 people in this
[05:11.310 --> 05:15.190]  place. So I was really proud. I was really happy to honor Brian that way.
[05:15.510 --> 05:19.270]  So big shout to everybody. Brian, I miss you, bro. We will move on.
[05:20.070 --> 05:24.110]  A few weeks ago, well, it's been ongoing. Over the past few weeks,
[05:24.110 --> 05:27.750]  we have talked about a raid that happened at a Santa Ana,
[05:27.750 --> 05:30.550]  California dispensary. I'll give you guys a little update.
[05:30.950 --> 05:32.590]  These cops raided a dispensary.
[05:33.390 --> 05:36.030]  They treated all of the people in the dispensary like shit.
[05:36.670 --> 05:41.190]  Once the dispensary was emptied of people, they took down all the cameras.
[05:41.270 --> 05:45.670]  And then they began to, they proceeded to destroy this dispensary.
[05:46.110 --> 05:48.950]  They broke the TVs. They broke the security systems.
[05:49.190 --> 05:53.030]  They caused damage to the safes. They caused a lot of damage to the displays.
[05:53.350 --> 05:58.070]  And then these police officers had the audacity to eat edibles
[05:58.590 --> 05:59.470]  on camera.
[05:59.790 --> 06:02.950]  There happened to be another hidden camera in the building that was recording
[06:02.950 --> 06:06.270]  that the cops didn't know about. And they were caught talking mad shit.
[06:06.270 --> 06:08.710]  They shouldn't have been saying they were eating edibles.
[06:08.790 --> 06:12.390]  They were playing darts and they were acting like assholes on camera.
[06:12.670 --> 06:13.790]  So they have been caught.
[06:14.230 --> 06:18.990]  The dispensary's lawyer discovered the video and filed a lawsuit
[06:19.030 --> 06:21.710]  against specific law enforcement officers.
[06:22.310 --> 06:24.430]  Now here is where we are today.
[06:24.430 --> 06:29.430]  Here's an article that I found on reason.com written by Jacob Solem.
[06:29.910 --> 06:33.910]  And the headline says suspended cops say video of them eating marijuana edibles
[06:33.910 --> 06:36.830]  during a raid violated their privacy.
[06:37.190 --> 06:40.350]  The sub headline is Santa Ana officers want to stop their department from using
[06:40.350 --> 06:43.990]  the footage to investigate them. I'm going to go ahead and read you the article.
[06:43.990 --> 06:44.830]  It says,
[06:44.870 --> 06:48.510]  remember the Santa Ana California cops who were caught on video munching on what
[06:48.510 --> 06:52.910]  seems to be cannabis infused chocolate bars after raiding an unlicensed medical
[06:52.910 --> 06:54.350]  marijuana dispensary in May.
[06:54.750 --> 06:58.150]  The Orange County register reports that three officers who were suspended after
[06:58.150 --> 07:02.230]  the incident are trying to stop the Santa Ana police department from using the
[07:02.230 --> 07:05.630]  footage in its internal investigation. Among other things,
[07:05.630 --> 07:08.990]  their lawsuit argues that the officers thought they had disabled all of the
[07:08.990 --> 07:13.470]  security cameras at Sky High Holistic and therefore had a reasonable expectation
[07:13.510 --> 07:14.390]  of privacy.
[07:14.750 --> 07:18.110]  The cops complained that the dispensary never got their permission to record
[07:18.110 --> 07:20.870]  them as they searched the premises.
[07:21.590 --> 07:26.590]  So these cops are trying to stop this video from being used in court because
[07:27.910 --> 07:31.910]  they were illegally recorded because since they had destroyed all of the
[07:31.910 --> 07:36.110]  security cameras, they therefore had a reasonable expectation of privacy.
[07:36.910 --> 07:41.910]  Now that means that if I break into your house and you film me,
[07:42.830 --> 07:47.350]  fuck your film because I had an expectation of privacy while I broke into your
[07:47.350 --> 07:50.430]  house and stole all your shit. That's what these cops are saying.
[07:51.030 --> 07:52.070]  It's a two way street.
[07:52.070 --> 07:55.670]  I don't think that a rule works just for cops that doesn't work for civilians.
[07:55.670 --> 07:58.270]  Right? These cops are trying to pull some shit. I'm going to keep reading here.
[07:58.270 --> 07:59.430]  It says all police,
[07:59.870 --> 08:03.870]  all police personnel present had a reasonable expect to expectation that their
[08:03.870 --> 08:07.710]  conversations were no longer being recorded and the undercover officers feeling
[08:07.710 --> 08:11.110]  that they were safe to do so removed their masks, says the complaint,
[08:11.310 --> 08:15.350]  which was filed in Orange County Superior Court without the illegal recordings,
[08:15.350 --> 08:19.310]  there would have been no internal investigation of any officer under California
[08:19.510 --> 08:23.670]  law. All parties to a confidential communication must consent to being recorded,
[08:23.830 --> 08:27.950]  but that rule does not apply when the parties to the communication may reasonably
[08:27.950 --> 08:31.590]  expect that the communication may be overheard or recorded.
[08:32.110 --> 08:33.390]  In an interview with the register,
[08:33.510 --> 08:37.230]  Sky High's lawyer Matthew Pappas noted that police routinely use surveillance
[08:37.230 --> 08:38.910]  camera video against suspects.
[08:39.150 --> 08:42.910]  It's pretty pathetic for police to say if we don't like something that it can be
[08:42.910 --> 08:46.470]  used, that it can't be used as evidence. He said they knew they were on video,
[08:46.470 --> 08:50.950]  just because they messed missed one camera doesn't make it illegal.
[08:52.030 --> 08:56.190]  I think we all agree here that this is complete bullshit because if you or I
[08:56.190 --> 08:59.790]  were caught doing something on a film, no matter how that film was made,
[09:00.070 --> 09:03.110]  that film would be used against us in a court of law.
[09:03.350 --> 09:07.630]  That film would probably be edited by the opposing lawyers to make us look like a
[09:07.630 --> 09:08.470]  pile of shit.
[09:08.750 --> 09:12.470]  So I think that this videotape should definitely be used in a court of law.
[09:12.910 --> 09:15.590]  These people, in my opinion,
[09:15.590 --> 09:18.830]  they illegally fucking attacked. If you know more about the story,
[09:18.910 --> 09:21.830]  these people illegally singled out this dispensary.
[09:21.830 --> 09:25.230]  So I hope that this video is used in court. If not,
[09:25.470 --> 09:28.550]  there are bigger problems in America than we knew about.
[09:28.870 --> 09:32.190]  I'm going to give a huge shout out to reason.com and also a big shout out to
[09:32.190 --> 09:33.870]  Jacob Solem. All right, you guys,
[09:33.990 --> 09:38.630]  my friend Fred Garvin recently sent me an email or was a Facebook message and
[09:38.630 --> 09:40.270]  it said, I don't remember exactly what it said.
[09:40.310 --> 09:43.510]  I'm going to kind of misquote him ridiculously, but he said, Hey Jeff,
[09:43.830 --> 09:46.270]  you used to do a bunch of grow lessons. That was what the show is about.
[09:46.270 --> 09:49.990]  And recently you were not doing grow lessons. What the hell happened? Fred,
[09:49.990 --> 09:52.310]  I agree with you. I've responded to you on Facebook.
[09:52.310 --> 09:55.750]  I addressed this on the last podcast. I completely agree with you, Fred.
[09:55.750 --> 09:59.070]  I need to get back to the grow lessons. So here's what I'm going to do.
[09:59.390 --> 10:03.630]  I'm going to take a fat dab and then I will be right back and we will talk
[10:03.630 --> 10:07.030]  about the importance of pH in your plants.
[10:07.110 --> 10:09.550]  So hang on for just one second, you guys, I'm going to take a dab,
[10:09.630 --> 10:13.230]  maybe get a drink and I will be right back. All right, you guys,
[10:13.230 --> 10:15.910]  I am back after a couple of dabs and I am feeling great.
[10:16.150 --> 10:20.430]  Now it's time to talk about pH a little bit. I've got a few notes here.
[10:20.430 --> 10:22.830]  I'm going to try to skim through these without sounding like I'm reading too
[10:22.830 --> 10:23.110]  much,
[10:23.110 --> 10:26.190]  but I needed some notes to keep myself on track because this has a lot of
[10:26.190 --> 10:29.590]  numbers and a lot of important things that we need to pay attention to.
[10:30.550 --> 10:32.950]  So let's get into it a little bit. Properly,
[10:33.030 --> 10:36.830]  properly adjusting the pH of your nutrient solution can solve a lot of problems
[10:36.830 --> 10:39.150]  and it can greatly improve the quality of your crop.
[10:40.150 --> 10:44.230]  I still do a little bit of consulting and I really see a lot of people
[10:44.230 --> 10:48.950]  overlooking the pH of their nutrient solution and how important it is to
[10:48.950 --> 10:53.110]  adjust the pH of their nutrient solution before they feed their plants.
[10:53.870 --> 10:57.230]  These guys have a lot of problems in their gardens that look like nutrient
[10:57.230 --> 11:00.830]  deficiencies and I see them trying to correct nutrient deficiencies.
[11:00.830 --> 11:05.630]  Like a lot of times a pH imbalance will look like it'll
[11:05.630 --> 11:10.630]  camouflage itself as maybe a cow mag problem or maybe a phosphorus overload.
[11:11.670 --> 11:15.710]  But a lot of times it's just a simple pH problem that could have been solved by
[11:15.710 --> 11:20.670]  adjusting the pH of your nutrient solution before you fed it to your plants.
[11:21.470 --> 11:23.550]  A lot of people will talk about soil pH.
[11:23.830 --> 11:26.230]  A lot of people are going to talk about different areas of pH.
[11:26.230 --> 11:30.910]  What I'm going to talk about is the pH balance of your nutrient solution,
[11:30.950 --> 11:34.630]  whether it be soil or hydro. If you're working in soil,
[11:35.110 --> 11:40.110]  the optimum pH range for your soil garden is about 5.5 to 6.5.
[11:42.550 --> 11:43.830]  If you were working in hydro,
[11:43.830 --> 11:48.830]  your optimum range is going to be somewhere between 5.8 and 6.2.
[11:49.390 --> 11:52.950]  Now you keep hearing me say that we need to be within a certain pH range.
[11:53.550 --> 11:57.870]  It would be ideal to find a certain number and stick with it is what most folks
[11:57.870 --> 11:58.310]  would think.
[11:58.310 --> 12:03.310]  But the reason we need a pH range is because some nutrients that we're feeding
[12:04.030 --> 12:04.790]  our plants,
[12:05.030 --> 12:08.830]  some of the elements that our plants are trying to absorb are available at
[12:08.830 --> 12:12.870]  certain pH levels and some are available at different pH levels.
[12:12.870 --> 12:16.710]  So I'm going to pick like in soil, nitrogen is available.
[12:17.110 --> 12:19.830]  You can pretty much suck up nitrogen at any point. Let's look at iron.
[12:19.870 --> 12:24.870]  Iron is more available on the lower side of the pH scale, the 3.5 range,
[12:25.150 --> 12:29.790]  the 3.5 to about 6.5 is where you're going to pick up iron.
[12:29.790 --> 12:31.870]  But if you get any higher on the pH range,
[12:32.150 --> 12:35.910]  you stop absorbing the iron. So then we're going to look at calcium.
[12:36.390 --> 12:40.350]  Calcium doesn't absorb very well in the 5.0 range,
[12:40.550 --> 12:43.990]  but it does start picking up at 5.5 to 6.5.
[12:43.990 --> 12:45.630]  You can really absorb calcium.
[12:45.950 --> 12:49.590]  But if you go out toward the 7.5 range,
[12:49.830 --> 12:51.310]  you stop picking up calcium.
[12:51.910 --> 12:56.910]  So these nutrients have a window where the pH is ideal for the plant to absorb
[12:57.630 --> 12:58.470]  each nutrient.
[12:58.750 --> 13:03.750]  And we have found that in soil somewhere between 5.5 and 6.5 is when all of
[13:04.510 --> 13:08.590]  these nutrients become available at the same time, ideally. And in hydro,
[13:08.590 --> 13:13.030]  like we said earlier, it's 5.8 to 6.2 where these nutrients become available.
[13:13.390 --> 13:17.150]  And let me tell you that the graph on the hydro side is much smaller.
[13:17.150 --> 13:22.150]  You have a much more narrow window of nutrient availability due to pH.
[13:23.110 --> 13:25.790]  I know that's a lot to absorb, but once this clicks in,
[13:25.830 --> 13:27.270]  it'll definitely make sense to you.
[13:27.630 --> 13:30.430]  Let me try to explain it like this a little bit. When it's really hot outside,
[13:30.470 --> 13:34.070]  you don't want hot cocoa, but when it's really cold outside, you do.
[13:34.430 --> 13:36.830]  And then when it's really cold outside, you don't want ice cream,
[13:36.830 --> 13:40.590]  but when it's warm outside, you want ice cream. So what we got to do,
[13:40.590 --> 13:44.510]  we got to find that perfect day where you can have hot cocoa for breakfast and
[13:44.530 --> 13:45.990]  you can have ice cream for lunch.
[13:46.310 --> 13:49.030]  And that's what we're trying to do for the plants by finding the perfect pH
[13:49.050 --> 13:49.310]  range.
[13:49.310 --> 13:52.510]  We're trying to find that optimum spot where they're in the mood for all of the
[13:52.510 --> 13:54.150]  nutrients we're feeding them. All right,
[13:54.150 --> 13:57.870]  now we should probably talk about what pH actually is and stands for.
[13:58.150 --> 14:02.510]  pH means potential hydrogen. It's written with a lowercase P and a capital H.
[14:02.750 --> 14:03.630]  And what pH is,
[14:03.630 --> 14:08.270]  is the measure of acid to alkalinity in our nutrient solution.
[14:09.510 --> 14:14.430]  pH is measured on a scale of zero to 14. Zero is the most acidic,
[14:14.590 --> 14:15.750]  seven is neutral,
[14:15.770 --> 14:19.670]  which means there's an equal concentration of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions.
[14:20.230 --> 14:23.750]  And then 14 is pure alkali. And it's done,
[14:23.750 --> 14:27.510]  it's measured on what is called a, I always fuck this word up.
[14:27.910 --> 14:31.590]  You only have to say it in this instance. It's a logarithmic scale,
[14:31.790 --> 14:36.550]  which means that every one point increase or decrease in pH
[14:37.630 --> 14:42.390]  reflects a tenfold change in acid or alkaline.
[14:42.750 --> 14:45.270]  So in a solution that's pH five,
[14:45.950 --> 14:50.470]  that solution is 10 times more acidic than a solution that is pH at six.
[14:50.790 --> 14:53.510]  So if you've got something that's pH at four,
[14:54.150 --> 14:58.470]  it's going to be 1000 times more acidic than a solution that's pH at six.
[14:58.830 --> 15:01.590]  So keep that in mind when you guys are using your pH pen.
[15:01.610 --> 15:03.470]  That's something that we'll talk about here in just a little bit,
[15:03.470 --> 15:05.270]  using your pH pen and your pH meter.
[15:05.870 --> 15:08.670]  You have to be really on the money when you're adjusting your pH.
[15:08.670 --> 15:11.790]  Once you find that range that your plants really like,
[15:11.790 --> 15:14.150]  you're going to want to try to set it right about there all the time.
[15:14.430 --> 15:18.590]  So if you're using soil somewhere within that five, eight to six, five,
[15:18.590 --> 15:21.590]  if you're in hydro somewhere in that five, six to six, three range,
[15:21.950 --> 15:26.310]  you're going to want to get your pH set and then keep an eye on the plants and
[15:26.310 --> 15:28.150]  then pay attention to where the plants,
[15:28.190 --> 15:30.670]  each strain is going to be a little different. You guys pay attention to,
[15:30.670 --> 15:35.310]  or each strain likes that pH set and try to get it there every time and take
[15:35.310 --> 15:40.310]  notes and keep in mind that 0.1 on there is a huge
[15:40.310 --> 15:44.070]  difference in your pH. So you can't just say I'm close enough.
[15:44.110 --> 15:47.470]  You got to get it close and we'll talk about how to adjust the pH and measure
[15:47.470 --> 15:51.550]  that here pretty soon. So also you guys keep in mind, if you're running hydro,
[15:52.350 --> 15:56.150]  your pH is going to change possibly every day because you're going to have
[15:56.430 --> 16:00.990]  nutrients absorbed by the plants. You're going to have water evaporate.
[16:01.030 --> 16:05.350]  There are going to be so many things that happen causing your pH to change that
[16:05.350 --> 16:08.230]  you're going to have to be on that in hydro. In soil,
[16:08.910 --> 16:12.630]  you're just going to mix up the bucket at the end before you feed it to the
[16:12.630 --> 16:15.070]  plants, you will test it and then you will adjust it.
[16:15.950 --> 16:16.110]  All right.
[16:16.110 --> 16:18.990]  It actually seems like I'm getting to the part where I should start explaining
[16:18.990 --> 16:23.110]  how to pH test your water and then how to correct the pH.
[16:23.510 --> 16:27.710]  So let's get into that a little bit here. First,
[16:27.710 --> 16:30.990]  I would, if you're mixing a hydro kit, go ahead and mix it in your reservoir,
[16:30.990 --> 16:34.510]  fill it up. Gosh, excuse me. Fill up your res with water.
[16:35.270 --> 16:37.070]  However you normally do it to the recommended amount.
[16:37.070 --> 16:39.710]  If you've got a 25 gallon res, go ahead and do 25 gallons.
[16:39.710 --> 16:40.670]  If you're doing a hydro kit,
[16:40.950 --> 16:43.750]  if you're doing soil and you do five gallon buckets or you got a big res,
[16:43.950 --> 16:46.550]  fill that up however you normally would with the amount you normally would.
[16:47.430 --> 16:49.630]  Then mix in your nutrients just like you normally would.
[16:50.110 --> 16:51.470]  I'm going to give a shout out to my buddy, John.
[16:51.470 --> 16:54.190]  He taught me something and I don't know how valid this is, but it made sense.
[16:54.190 --> 16:56.550]  John says, if you're using potassium silicates,
[16:56.910 --> 17:01.310]  pour that in your water very first. He had a good sound reason.
[17:01.310 --> 17:03.550]  One day we'll get John on the show and he can explain why.
[17:03.870 --> 17:06.150]  John says pour your potassium silicate first.
[17:06.510 --> 17:07.750]  Then if you're going to use CalMag,
[17:07.790 --> 17:11.670]  do your CalMag next and then do all of your other nutrients after that.
[17:12.310 --> 17:16.790]  His reasoning made sense and I don't want to try to butcher the reason that he
[17:16.790 --> 17:19.390]  told me. So one day we'll get John on the show to talk about it.
[17:19.670 --> 17:23.750]  If you're a listener and you have a good example of why and you can explain it,
[17:23.750 --> 17:26.190]  send me an email and I would like to see what you're thinking.
[17:26.190 --> 17:28.590]  I want to see if somebody else is on the same page as my buddy, John.
[17:29.030 --> 17:31.910]  So fill your reservoir, mix your nutrients in there,
[17:32.150 --> 17:34.790]  do your potassium silicate first, then do your CalMag,
[17:34.790 --> 17:37.070]  then do the rest of your nutrients however you wish.
[17:37.470 --> 17:42.470]  Then now is the time when you need to use a pH pen or some type of pH meter or
[17:45.110 --> 17:49.950]  a pH probe and you need to stick that into this nutrient solution and you need to
[17:49.950 --> 17:54.630]  see what the display says, what the number reads on the display.
[17:55.070 --> 17:58.390]  If you can't afford a pH pen or a pH meter,
[17:58.870 --> 18:03.190]  you can use an aquarium test kit to tell you what the pH is.
[18:03.190 --> 18:06.590]  They sell them at the aquarium shop. You could probably pick it up at Walmart.
[18:07.350 --> 18:12.350]  It's used in an aquarium environment to tell you what the pH of your aquarium
[18:12.590 --> 18:16.230]  water would be so that you don't kill your fish. It'll do the exact same thing.
[18:16.230 --> 18:17.710]  We're just testing for pH here.
[18:18.030 --> 18:20.590]  This stuff isn't going to go into your nutrient solution.
[18:20.590 --> 18:24.110]  You'll take some water out. You will actually,
[18:24.110 --> 18:25.710]  you'll dip this strip into the water.
[18:26.190 --> 18:28.710]  I don't even remember how to use the reagent shit. It's been that long.
[18:29.430 --> 18:32.150]  You put some water on it and then you drop these chemicals on it and it shows
[18:32.150 --> 18:34.190]  you what color it is and you measure it up to the color.
[18:34.430 --> 18:36.790]  And if it's like real blue, then you're the wrong way.
[18:36.790 --> 18:39.190]  And if it's real red, you're the wrong way. You want to get kind of in the middle,
[18:39.430 --> 18:41.630]  but those test strips, they're kind of a pain in the ass. You guys,
[18:41.630 --> 18:43.950]  you could tell by my description. That's why I haven't used it in years.
[18:43.990 --> 18:48.230]  It's why I'll never use it again. Get yourself a good pH pen or a pH meter.
[18:49.390 --> 18:53.030]  The pens are way easier to use. Do not drop your pen in the water.
[18:53.270 --> 18:56.950]  It'll be toast. Keep your pen calibrated.
[18:56.950 --> 18:58.310]  If you don't know how to calibrate it,
[18:58.310 --> 19:01.950]  take it to your local grow shop and they will probably calibrate it for you.
[19:02.190 --> 19:03.430]  And after the third or fourth time,
[19:03.430 --> 19:05.630]  they'll get tired of doing it and they will teach you how to do it.
[19:05.630 --> 19:08.750]  Just go ask them how to do it. They'll calibrate your pH pen for you.
[19:09.110 --> 19:13.510]  Always keep, no matter what type of pH pen you're using, always keep the probe,
[19:13.750 --> 19:16.990]  the tip, that white part in there. Always keep that wet.
[19:17.470 --> 19:21.190]  Here's something to remember with a pH pen, a pH tester, a pH probe,
[19:21.590 --> 19:23.830]  other than the reagent. If you're using the expensive,
[19:23.830 --> 19:27.310]  any kind of pen that you dip in the water, if it dries, it dies.
[19:27.710 --> 19:31.710]  That is the thing to remember. If it dries, it dies. Keep your pH pen wet,
[19:31.750 --> 19:35.190]  keep it calibrated, keep it clean and keep it handy all the time.
[19:36.630 --> 19:40.830]  I, myself, I use the blue lab three in one combo.
[19:40.830 --> 19:45.390]  It's got a pH meter, a PPM meter, and a temperature gauge on there.
[19:45.390 --> 19:47.950]  That's called a thermometer, right? Yeah. It's got that on there.
[19:48.150 --> 19:51.830]  It's a three in one combo. It's a little pricey. Uh, if you can't afford that,
[19:52.110 --> 19:56.110]  get yourself, you know, those yellow Milwaukee's work. That's you'll see it.
[19:56.150 --> 19:57.790]  If you go to the grocery and you look for a pH pen,
[19:57.790 --> 20:01.950]  you'll see the yellow Milwaukee pH meter. That thing's a piece of shit,
[20:01.990 --> 20:05.430]  but it will work. It'll do what you need done. I would recommend a better one.
[20:05.430 --> 20:09.710]  If you can afford a more expensive, higher quality pH meter, I would go for it.
[20:09.750 --> 20:13.990]  But that little yellow Milwaukee piece of shit will work. It will die on you soon.
[20:14.110 --> 20:17.230]  So be prepared to buy another one. If you can get the next upgraded one,
[20:17.230 --> 20:21.150]  whatever it is, do that. Like I said, I like blue lab products.
[20:21.430 --> 20:24.150]  My buddy John was telling me he likes another brand for some reason.
[20:24.470 --> 20:28.190]  I stick with the blue lab. I've never had any problems. Uh,
[20:28.230 --> 20:32.030]  that's what I would do. So you stick the meter in there. Uh,
[20:32.070 --> 20:35.550]  so you, you fill up your reservoir, you mix your nutrients in the proper order.
[20:36.150 --> 20:38.830]  Uh, you let it be, it's gotta be at about room temperature. You guys,
[20:38.830 --> 20:41.630]  like you don't want your water too hot or too cold because that will definitely
[20:41.630 --> 20:46.390]  affect the pH. Um, get it at room temperature, maybe set it in the grow room.
[20:46.390 --> 20:48.150]  If it's coming out of the faucet, too hot or too cold,
[20:48.150 --> 20:51.270]  go set in your grow room for a little while so that it's the same temperature as
[20:51.270 --> 20:55.670]  your room. Then mix your nutrients into there. Then put your pH meter in there.
[20:56.230 --> 21:00.630]  It's going to show a number. Uh, hopefully most tap water, uh,
[21:00.670 --> 21:03.350]  most municipal tap water comes out depending on where you are.
[21:03.350 --> 21:05.590]  It's between eight and nine. Just depends on where you are.
[21:05.590 --> 21:07.470]  And that will change seasonally you guys,
[21:07.750 --> 21:12.550]  or when your local water company cleans their pipes or does some flushing or
[21:12.550 --> 21:16.630]  changes chemicals that they want to use, or it'll be seasonal for sure.
[21:16.710 --> 21:18.710]  Pay attention because in the summer and in the winter,
[21:19.030 --> 21:22.870]  I can tell a huge difference in my water quality. So pay attention to that.
[21:23.150 --> 21:25.630]  Test your water once in a while, just pour water out of the faucet,
[21:25.630 --> 21:26.630]  let it get to room temperature,
[21:26.630 --> 21:29.350]  stick your pH probe in there and see what it is occasionally just for fun.
[21:29.910 --> 21:32.070]  You should always be testing everything that's going into your plants.
[21:32.750 --> 21:34.750]  I'm always curious about what's going into my plants.
[21:34.990 --> 21:38.590]  So you mix your stuff up. Where the hell was I? Mix your stuff up,
[21:38.990 --> 21:42.390]  stick your pH pen in there. It's going to show you a number. Hopefully, um,
[21:42.430 --> 21:44.870]  you're close. You know what I mean? You're usually, once you've mixed your
[21:44.870 --> 21:47.910]  nutrients, you're hardly ever going to need pH up.
[21:48.230 --> 21:49.710]  If you need to put pH up in there,
[21:49.710 --> 21:52.030]  you probably are mixing your nutrients too strong.
[21:52.030 --> 21:53.990]  You're probably using something you shouldn't be using.
[21:53.990 --> 21:56.390]  You probably did something wrong. Probably.
[21:56.550 --> 21:59.110]  There are some instances where your pH will drop really low.
[21:59.110 --> 22:01.790]  That's okay, but you're going to need to bring it back up.
[22:02.030 --> 22:05.830]  That doesn't happen very frequently. Um, you're going to be too high.
[22:05.870 --> 22:08.430]  You're probably going to be, once you mix up your nutrients,
[22:08.430 --> 22:10.350]  you're probably going to be about 7.2.
[22:10.790 --> 22:14.390]  You're going to need to get that down closer to the 6.5 range. If you're in soil,
[22:14.950 --> 22:15.870]  if you're running hydro,
[22:15.870 --> 22:20.830]  you want to get that down closer to like the, uh, 6.0 kind of area,
[22:20.830 --> 22:24.830]  I guess, uh, the way you're going to want to do that is slowly,
[22:25.230 --> 22:28.870]  very slowly add your pH down just a little bit.
[22:29.110 --> 22:31.590]  You guys don't get this shit in your eyes. Don't get it on your skin.
[22:31.870 --> 22:35.470]  If you're new at this and you're intimidated, or if you're a clumsy fucker,
[22:35.510 --> 22:37.870]  put on some gloves and put on some protective goggles.
[22:38.110 --> 22:39.630]  I have a friend who's in Michigan.
[22:39.630 --> 22:42.310]  I won't say his name cause I don't want to embarrass you. Uh,
[22:42.350 --> 22:43.230]  but my friend Jason,
[22:43.470 --> 22:48.150]  he splashed some pH down into his eye just a little bit.
[22:48.150 --> 22:52.470]  He said he got a small drop of pH in his eye and he said he went completely
[22:52.490 --> 22:53.430]  blind in that eye.
[22:53.710 --> 22:57.030]  And he said it was so excruciating that he couldn't open the other eye and he
[22:57.030 --> 23:00.470]  had to use Siri on his iPhone to call nine one,
[23:00.470 --> 23:04.950]  one to come to his house and help him in his grow because he couldn't fucking
[23:04.950 --> 23:09.110]  see. So don't put yourself in that kind of situation. You guys be safe. Uh,
[23:09.110 --> 23:11.950]  if you're a clumsy fuck, wear some goggles. Even if you're a pro,
[23:11.950 --> 23:14.430]  it might be a good idea to wear some safety goggles or something.
[23:14.430 --> 23:16.550]  When you're mixing this stuff, the pH can real,
[23:16.550 --> 23:18.630]  the pH adjusters can really,
[23:18.870 --> 23:21.790]  really mess with your eyes and your skin if they get on you and get in your eye.
[23:22.030 --> 23:24.870]  So pour a little bit of pH down in there. Uh,
[23:24.910 --> 23:27.110]  I would start with like five to 10 milliliters.
[23:27.110 --> 23:30.630]  That's five milliliters in a five gallon bucket is probably enough to drop your
[23:30.630 --> 23:34.070]  pH down where you need it. Drop that in there. Shake it up real good.
[23:34.550 --> 23:37.390]  Put your pH meter back in there and see what you're testing.
[23:37.390 --> 23:40.470]  Now you want to get it right on the money. That's going to,
[23:40.470 --> 23:42.150]  you're going to have to fuck up a couple of batches.
[23:42.170 --> 23:46.270]  You might have to use pH up and down so many times that you just don't even want
[23:46.290 --> 23:49.750]  to use it because all the shit that you've just added to your, uh,
[23:49.770 --> 23:52.830]  your solution, you've got too much pH up and too much pH down in there.
[23:53.230 --> 23:55.390]  So you're going to have to just pour that out and start over,
[23:55.870 --> 23:58.110]  but don't be afraid. That's how you're going to learn. You guys,
[23:58.130 --> 24:02.870]  that is how you are going to learn. So add your pH up, add your pH down,
[24:03.390 --> 24:05.550]  whichever you need to do, and then test it.
[24:05.550 --> 24:07.510]  And once you've got it right where you want it,
[24:07.770 --> 24:10.670]  go ahead and pour that water into your plants. If it's a soil garden,
[24:10.910 --> 24:11.870]  if it's a hydro garden,
[24:11.890 --> 24:15.550]  go ahead and start turning on the res and get it going or the pumps or whatever
[24:15.550 --> 24:18.110]  you got to do. There's so much, there's so many different ways to do hydro.
[24:18.110 --> 24:20.950]  You guys, I am learning hydro. Um, all right,
[24:20.950 --> 24:24.150]  I'm going to say that, uh, this lesson for pH is pretty much wrapped up.
[24:24.150 --> 24:26.190]  I feel like I've covered all of my bullet points.
[24:26.430 --> 24:29.550]  Keep in mind that your local water will change and you should check that out.
[24:29.990 --> 24:30.830]  Um,
[24:31.830 --> 24:33.190]  that's the kind of shit that you should worry about.
[24:33.190 --> 24:35.990]  Your local water is going to change frequently and there's nothing that you can
[24:36.010 --> 24:38.510]  do about it. You're going to have to just be on top of that.
[24:38.830 --> 24:42.910]  The only way that you can really control your water is if you set up a reverse
[24:42.910 --> 24:47.630]  osmosis machine and you start cleaning everything out of all of your water and
[24:47.630 --> 24:50.790]  starting fresh. But that could be a whole nother lesson. I'll find,
[24:50.790 --> 24:52.670]  I will try to find a water expert.
[24:52.950 --> 24:56.350]  If you were listening and you're an expert on water and water quality for a
[24:56.350 --> 24:57.790]  grow, you let me know.
[24:58.110 --> 25:01.310]  I'll bring you on the show and you can teach us all about water.
[25:01.510 --> 25:02.550]  I know a lot about the plant,
[25:02.570 --> 25:07.150]  but there are so many niche areas that people have perfected.
[25:07.150 --> 25:11.070]  Like our buddy Sean's got organics figured out and I seem to be the breeder in
[25:11.090 --> 25:13.550]  the group. And then Spence is the hash guy.
[25:13.590 --> 25:16.350]  There are just so many small branches of this that we've got figured out that
[25:16.350 --> 25:18.670]  each person does their own little as mastered.
[25:18.670 --> 25:20.830]  So I'm going to try to get a water guy on here for you guys.
[25:21.470 --> 25:24.670]  And we'll talk about water quality and what you should be looking for.
[25:25.030 --> 25:27.150]  That could probably be a, just a segment. Anyway,
[25:27.710 --> 25:30.510]  I was going to branch off and say, dude, I have been learning hydro.
[25:30.550 --> 25:33.950]  I've been talking to my buddy John that works with me at the spot.
[25:33.970 --> 25:35.510]  He is the hydro master.
[25:36.110 --> 25:40.470]  I will be learning so much hydro in a crash course here in the next few months
[25:40.490 --> 25:43.830]  that you guys are going to learn hydro with me. I will learn a bunch.
[25:44.030 --> 25:46.990]  I will start sharing the hydro talk with you guys.
[25:47.390 --> 25:52.270]  We're building the most killer grow facility at the spot dispensary in Pueblo
[25:52.270 --> 25:55.910]  West Colorado. You guys, there are over a hundred lights in flower.
[25:55.950 --> 25:58.670]  There are four flowering rooms broken down. Uh,
[25:58.690 --> 26:02.510]  they have 24 to 26 lights per room. Um,
[26:02.590 --> 26:04.510]  we've got a really nice veg area.
[26:05.190 --> 26:10.070]  We are running 50 foot long flood and drain tables that we
[26:10.070 --> 26:14.230]  fill up. Uh, we fill up about 150 gallons worth of water for a res.
[26:14.510 --> 26:16.830]  We mix 150 gallons worth of newts.
[26:17.110 --> 26:19.710]  We pump that into the table at one end,
[26:19.730 --> 26:23.110]  it shoots all the way to the other end of the table, goes into a drain.
[26:23.590 --> 26:26.550]  There's a pump, um, a really snazzy pump.
[26:26.550 --> 26:30.510]  The quality they use at SeaWorld shoots all of that water through 50 feet of
[26:30.510 --> 26:31.710]  tubing. Uh,
[26:32.270 --> 26:36.710]  I think it's two inch or three inch PVC all the way back to the other end of the
[26:36.730 --> 26:37.110]  table.
[26:37.110 --> 26:40.590]  And then it dumps it back into the table and just keeps recirculating it.
[26:40.990 --> 26:43.470]  And then under each plant. So then we have,
[26:43.710 --> 26:45.790]  I can't really tell you too much about how we do the plant sites.
[26:45.790 --> 26:47.270]  Cause that's kind of a proprietary thing.
[26:47.670 --> 26:52.430]  We've got each plant is designated its own site and it's in a rock wool cube
[26:53.590 --> 26:57.470]  and underneath each rock wool cube and plant site,
[26:57.510 --> 27:01.390]  there is a ring shooting a lot of oxygen up underneath these plants.
[27:02.030 --> 27:05.390]  So it's, we're feeding from the bottom and the rock wool is waking it up.
[27:05.910 --> 27:08.950]  And then we may, we're not sure if we want to do this yet,
[27:08.970 --> 27:13.390]  but there may be a drip line put in to top feed all of the plants so that we can
[27:13.430 --> 27:17.830]  drip that nutrient solution into the rock wool cube from the top and then just
[27:17.830 --> 27:20.470]  let the roots hang into that oxygenated water. But you guys,
[27:20.470 --> 27:23.950]  I'm learning so much about hydro. I have built, we have built,
[27:23.950 --> 27:24.830]  I can't say I built,
[27:25.270 --> 27:29.990]  I've been involved in building a huge hydro environment and I've learned so much
[27:30.010 --> 27:33.590]  without even putting plants in there yet. We're almost ready for plants in there.
[27:34.470 --> 27:38.570]  Um, we will be pulling harvest out of there in no time.
[27:38.570 --> 27:40.750]  It feels like we are so ready. I'm getting stoked.
[27:40.750 --> 27:43.950]  You guys can tell just by the tone of my voice that I'm fucking excited about
[27:43.950 --> 27:46.070]  the girl with the spot dispensary. Big shout out to the spot.
[27:46.070 --> 27:47.110]  Big shout out to Dave and Robert.
[27:47.110 --> 27:50.070]  Thanks for giving me the opportunity and also a big shout out to the guys I've
[27:50.070 --> 27:53.390]  been working with my grow crew, my construction crew. Big shout out to John.
[27:53.670 --> 27:57.110]  Big shout out to Joe and a super shout out to Jaime. Love all you guys.
[27:57.130 --> 27:58.630]  Thanks for helping me out. Thanks for supporting me.
[27:58.630 --> 28:01.830]  Thanks for seeing the vision and thanks for being a good team. All right.
[28:02.190 --> 28:03.590]  That's a big ridiculous shout out right there.
[28:03.610 --> 28:06.070]  I'm glad I got that one off my chest. You guys, I want to thank you for listening.
[28:06.070 --> 28:08.070]  It feels like it's almost time to wrap up the show.
[28:08.190 --> 28:10.910]  Since you've listened to this far, I'm going to do this to you. Uh,
[28:10.930 --> 28:13.190]  this podcast was of course brought to you by my good friends at high grow,
[28:13.190 --> 28:16.550]  indoor growing supplies. I grow does have two locations to serve Colorado.
[28:16.790 --> 28:20.590]  They have a Denver store. It's on 62 71 beach street. And then there's my favorite.
[28:20.610 --> 28:24.390]  It's the Pueblo location on six 18 East fourth street in beautiful Pueblo,
[28:24.390 --> 28:25.210]  Colorado.
[28:25.310 --> 28:27.910]  Check out high grow for competitive pricing and a great selection of indoor
[28:27.930 --> 28:30.870]  growing supplies. You guys, when you're at high grow and you're checking out,
[28:31.030 --> 28:33.950]  tell them that you listened to the grow from your heart podcast and they will
[28:33.950 --> 28:36.430]  give you commercial pricing on your entire purchase.
[28:36.430 --> 28:37.870]  That'll save you a bunch of bucks,
[28:37.870 --> 28:41.950]  which is always a good thing because money is expensive these days.
[28:42.430 --> 28:46.030]  All right. No more ads. You guys, I won't do any more ads. That's the end.
[28:46.030 --> 28:47.190]  We're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.
[28:47.190 --> 28:50.510]  I want to thank everybody for listening. Uh, you guys, now that the show is over,
[28:50.990 --> 28:54.910]  uh, make sure you go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store, find the review section,
[28:54.910 --> 28:56.510]  search for the grow from your heart podcast.

[29:05.190 --> 29:08.830]  I'll keep doing exactly what I'm doing. I appreciate the feedback. Also,
[29:08.830 --> 29:13.070]  I'd love for you guys to participate in the social media. I'm on Facebook.
[29:13.110 --> 29:17.510]  It's grow from your heart podcast. I'm on Twitter. It's at GFYH podcast.
[29:17.790 --> 29:22.230]  We are on Instagram under at I read genetics. I love all of the interaction.
[29:22.510 --> 29:23.910]  I'd love to see you guys get involved.
[29:24.270 --> 29:27.510]  I haven't been doing as much Periscope videos lately because I've just been busy
[29:27.510 --> 29:30.750]  with work, but I will get back on that one because that's a lot of fun.
[29:31.630 --> 29:33.870]  If you have something to say and you don't want to say it on the social media,
[29:34.150 --> 29:36.750]  you can always email me. It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[29:36.990 --> 29:39.790]  I'll get you all of the information that you need. You guys,

[30:31.030 --> 30:31.870]  Now.
[30:32.310 --> 30:36.110]  I'm working on getting the new zoom H six so that we could take the podcast on
[30:36.110 --> 30:38.590]  the road. Go do the show at a few more places.
[30:38.590 --> 30:41.510]  Go visit the grimy Gatsby since we can't get you to come down to Pueblo.
[30:41.910 --> 30:45.270]  We'll do a podcast with damsel in Colorado Springs. If we get the zoom H six,
[30:45.270 --> 30:47.550]  we'll get a lot of shit going on. But, um,
[30:47.550 --> 30:50.150]  I think that's all I got for you today. You guys make sure you follow me on
[30:50.230 --> 30:54.470]  Instagram. It's at I read genetics. I just hit 17,000 followers recently.
[30:54.670 --> 30:55.350]  See what I'm doing.
[30:55.350 --> 30:58.750]  I'm posting pictures of the spot dispensary's build up there and posting
[30:58.750 --> 31:01.750]  pictures of my personal grow up there and posting pictures of my adventures up
[31:01.770 --> 31:04.150]  there. A lot of great shit to check out. So you guys,
[31:04.150 --> 31:07.030]  I want to give a big shout out to my ninja Spence. Thank you for listening.
[31:07.030 --> 31:10.390]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[31:11.390 --> 31:13.230]  Kids. Don't try to sit home.
[31:15.230 --> 31:16.830]  Leave your appearance smoke alone.
[31:20.490 --> 31:25.130]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Talking about green indoor,
[31:25.130 --> 31:26.490]  outdoor scene. Green.
[31:29.090 --> 31:31.090]  We, we, I love weed.
[31:38.500 --> 31:43.500]  Yes, we are in California. The place we plan to in the car proposition to 15.
[31:45.460 --> 31:47.460]  It's a medical need. Tell him out.
[31:54.540 --> 31:55.380]  Oh my God.
[31:57.380 --> 31:59.340]  We, we, I love weed.

[32:09.370 --> 32:10.930]  Your bag is empty.
[32:11.410 --> 32:15.290]  Can't me and me. My God, your bag should be plenty.
[32:16.210 --> 32:20.090]  Proposition to 15. It's a medical.
[32:21.570 --> 32:24.890]  She needs a weed. Yes, you really need some weed.
[32:53.820 --> 32:55.860]  Weed. Weed. I love weed.
[32:58.420 --> 33:00.540]  Weed. Weed. I love weed.
[33:01.100 --> 33:02.380]  I love the weed.
[33:03.100 --> 33:05.180]  The founding father smoke the weed.
[33:05.420 --> 33:07.460]  The founding father plant the weed.
[33:07.780 --> 33:09.900]  The founding father plant the seed.
[33:10.220 --> 33:10.740]  They are.
[33:13.220 --> 33:14.580]  We, I love weed.
[33:14.700 --> 33:16.700]  You and I are 20 love the weed.
[33:17.220 --> 33:19.340]  Raise your hand if you love weed.

[33:31.420 --> 33:33.460]  Listen to the reggae song.
[33:34.140 --> 33:35.740]  We bump into my father.
[33:36.060 --> 33:38.140]  Medical weed. Don't get me wrong.
[33:38.420 --> 33:40.060]  I love the weed.
[33:40.660 --> 33:42.780]  Now they coming from back the road.
[33:45.680 --> 33:47.480]  Aces to deja vu.
[33:47.720 --> 33:49.360]  Check smoking the weed.
