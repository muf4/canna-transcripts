[00:00.060 --> 00:08.060]  Welcome back podcast world. I'm your host my friends call me Rasta Jeff and this is episode 605 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[00:08.060 --> 00:16.060]  In this episode I'm going to read a few Patreon messages. Before we get there let's do a few shout outs to a few of our friends who support the show on Patreon.
[00:16.060 --> 00:21.060]  Let's start off with a big grow from your heart podcast. Thank you shout out to my friend Glen Geroni.

[00:25.060 --> 00:30.060]  Let's send a big thank you to Godfather Kush. I want to send a special thank you shout out to my friend the Canna Crat.
[00:30.060 --> 00:33.060]  Let's follow that up with a thank you shout out to Coach Steve.

[00:52.060 --> 00:57.060]  Big shout out to the Neighborhood Crew and big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[00:57.060 --> 01:06.060]  If you're not supporting the show on Patreon and you'd like to learn how to do so, all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:06.060 --> 01:10.060]  All of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[01:10.060 --> 01:16.060]  Of course I did include that link in the show notes and the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:17.060 --> 01:20.060]  Alright this is going to be a fun episode. I've got quite a few emails selected.
[01:20.060 --> 01:23.060]  Before we get there let me do a quick update.
[01:23.060 --> 01:29.060]  I did an episode talking about light leaks and light leaks during the night cycle causing problems for our plants.
[01:29.060 --> 01:36.060]  I got a lot of messages saying yeah but what about the moon? I grow outdoors and the moon is really bright and the moon does not mess with my outdoor plants.
[01:36.060 --> 01:42.060]  You are absolutely correct. The moon is part of nature. If the moon disrupted our plants outside nature would be fucked.
[01:42.060 --> 01:47.060]  So let me explain briefly why the moon does not disrupt your outdoor flowering plants.
[01:47.060 --> 01:52.060]  As the sun sets it puts off a red spectrum. I don't know that the sun actually puts off the red spectrum.
[01:52.060 --> 02:00.060]  Something with the atmosphere, the angle of the sun and the sky create a red spectrum of light that happens in our environment and is fed to our plants.
[02:00.060 --> 02:04.060]  The plants receive that red spectrum that is known as far red lighting.
[02:04.060 --> 02:09.060]  That far red lighting triggers something in our plants known as phytochrome.
[02:09.060 --> 02:14.060]  That phytochrome red response makes the plants think oh it is sleepy time and I should go to sleep.
[02:14.060 --> 02:20.060]  We are basically giving the plants a little dose of NyQuil when they see that red light spectrum so they go to sleep.
[02:20.060 --> 02:27.060]  They are a little more solidly put to sleep than the plants that we have in our indoor garden unless you are supplementing with far red light pucks.
[02:27.060 --> 02:33.060]  So the reason your plants are not freaking out outdoors is because of that far red spectrum has put them to sleep.
[02:33.060 --> 02:41.060]  They are in a more deep sleep state than our plants that are in the indoor environment because they are not getting sun and they are not getting that far red.
[02:41.060 --> 02:46.060]  Also your grow lights, your flashlight does not compare at all to the sun.
[02:46.060 --> 02:51.060]  They are used to getting that sunshine all day. That is the most intense light they can get. It is also the proper light.
[02:51.060 --> 02:56.060]  So they are getting the best light, the most intense all day. Then they get that far red spectrum.
[02:56.060 --> 03:00.060]  Triggers phytochrome. That is why they do not freak out from the moonlight.
[03:00.060 --> 03:03.060]  Phytochrome is nothing compared to that bright sunlight they are getting.
[03:03.060 --> 03:09.060]  That combined with the far red spectrum, the phytochrome red response, they do not freak out outdoors due to the moon.
[03:09.060 --> 03:15.060]  They will however freak out outdoors due to your porch light or a street light right above your garden.
[03:15.060 --> 03:19.060]  That is all plant specific but the moon should not disrupt your plants.
[03:19.060 --> 03:25.060]  However, unnatural lights still do have the opportunity to disrupt your plants in the night cycle outdoors.
[03:25.060 --> 03:28.060]  I hope I have cleared that up. I hope I made that clear.
[03:28.060 --> 03:33.060]  Big shout out to everybody who sent me that question because I got that question from at least 10 people.
[03:33.060 --> 03:37.060]  They said why don't my plants freak out from the moon. That is how nature works dude.
[03:37.060 --> 03:42.060]  So I have cleared that up. Now let us move into the real part of today's episode.
[03:42.060 --> 03:45.060]  I have got a bunch of emails here in front of me. I do have one more note.
[03:45.060 --> 03:51.060]  I am still selecting testers you guys. I sent an episode out a while back telling you how to become a tester.
[03:51.060 --> 03:56.060]  Asking for tester applications. I got probably 2500 tester applications.
[03:56.060 --> 04:02.060]  They are in a folder. I am going through them. Don't feel discouraged. Don't feel dismissed or forgotten if you have not gotten a reply.
[04:02.060 --> 04:07.060]  I am going through testers and I am still selecting testers. They are still being sent out.
[04:07.060 --> 04:10.060]  So keep your hopes up and keep in mind I don't just do testing once.
[04:10.060 --> 04:15.060]  There are always new things being created. So I am always going to need new testers.
[04:15.060 --> 04:18.060]  I will select about 10 testers for every batch of seeds that I am trying to do.
[04:18.060 --> 04:23.060]  When I send them out I do about 10 at a time. So I will select 10 testers. I will get them going.
[04:23.060 --> 04:26.060]  When I select about 10 more, get them going. Select about 10 more, get them going.
[04:26.060 --> 04:33.060]  Chances are 7 out of each batch of 10 are going to reply which will give me 3 open spots for the next time I am looking for testers.
[04:33.060 --> 04:37.060]  I have got 70% reliability on the testers I send stuff out to.
[04:37.060 --> 04:42.060]  So testers will fall off. New testers will be needed. Don't feel like you missed an opportunity.
[04:42.060 --> 04:44.060]  Don't feel like I ignored you. Don't feel like I blew you off.
[04:44.060 --> 04:49.060]  I got a lot of responses and a lot of submissions. I am trying to read through each and every one of them carefully.
[04:49.060 --> 04:53.060]  So I don't miss any valid, any great potential candidates.
[04:53.060 --> 04:55.060]  Please again you guys don't feel discouraged.
[04:55.060 --> 05:00.060]  And if you are still interested in being a tester, go listen to my tester episode before you even apply.
[05:00.060 --> 05:04.060]  It is very important that you listen to that episode. You will get all of the instructions and expectations.
[05:04.060 --> 05:09.060]  You will know what I want from you. Then we can help each other meet a goal.
[05:09.060 --> 05:12.060]  Don't be discouraged. That is my point. And keep the tester applications coming.
[05:12.060 --> 05:18.060]  Now is the time when we jump in to the email, Patreon message part of the show.
[05:18.060 --> 05:22.060]  Again if you want your questions right on Patreon, all you have to do is support us on Patreon.
[05:22.060 --> 05:25.060]  Go to patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[05:25.060 --> 05:28.060]  Sign up for Patreon. We will get your questions right on the air.
[05:28.060 --> 05:31.060]  This one comes from our friend Yee Motherfucking Ha.
[05:31.060 --> 05:34.060]  And it goes a lot like this. Greetings Ross to Jeff.
[05:34.060 --> 05:40.060]  Recently my wife mentioned to me that she thinks she would like to try her hand at growing her own medicine.
[05:40.060 --> 05:43.060]  That is awesome. I love it when the wife tries to get involved with growing.
[05:43.060 --> 05:46.060]  She is smoking it. Why shouldn't she be right in there helping you?
[05:46.060 --> 05:49.060]  Growing is not a boys club. I think the ladies should be involved.
[05:49.060 --> 05:52.060]  So it says how awesome is that? Dude that is awesome.
[05:52.060 --> 05:55.060]  A family that grows together, grows together literally.
[05:55.060 --> 06:02.060]  Then it says I am currently, I currently run my lights from 6am to 6pm because I work from home and it's just been convenient.
[06:02.060 --> 06:09.060]  That makes sense. However with her work schedule and spending time with our family this time frame is not going to work.
[06:09.060 --> 06:13.060]  So you've got it on your perfect schedule but it doesn't include the wife so we need to make some adjustments.
[06:14.060 --> 06:16.060]  Very logical and rational needs here.
[06:16.060 --> 06:25.060]  It says I am thinking about switching from 9pm to 9am so we can both go into the garden together when the lights come on and the kids are in bed.
[06:25.060 --> 06:27.060]  That is a great strategy. It makes a lot of sense.
[06:27.060 --> 06:30.060]  You guys will both be home at night. The kids are in bed. You can hang out.
[06:30.060 --> 06:34.060]  You can smoke. You can go in the garden. Then you can wrap up the night together.
[06:34.060 --> 06:40.060]  Also electricity is cheaper at off peak hours so you will save a couple of bucks on the electric bill by doing this.
[06:40.060 --> 06:46.060]  It goes on to say I run a perpetual flower space and I hate to make this drastic time change on my girls
[06:46.060 --> 06:50.060]  but I'm willing to do it if it means sharing my passion with my wife.
[06:50.060 --> 06:53.060]  That is great dedication. A great sacrifice you're ready to make.
[06:53.060 --> 07:05.060]  Now the question part is, my question is how fast can I make the transition in timing from my lights on at 6am to my lights on at 9pm without having detrimental effects on my plants.
[07:05.060 --> 07:12.060]  My thought is to change my timer by 3 or 4 hours at a time but leave a week or two between those changes to let plants adjust.
[07:12.060 --> 07:18.060]  Would that be harmful overall or just fuck it and swap the timer.
[07:18.060 --> 07:20.060]  Thanks again for all you do for us.
[07:20.060 --> 07:28.060]  2020 surely would have been much much worse without the Grow From Your Heart podcast in my ears and I read genetics in my garden.
[07:28.060 --> 07:32.060]  That's a great compliment. Thank you. I'm glad I could make 2020 a little bit better for you.
[07:32.060 --> 07:36.060]  It looks like we're off to making 2021 even better for you already.
[07:36.060 --> 07:40.060]  Here is my solution for your, it's not a problem but it is a question.
[07:40.060 --> 07:42.060]  Here's my answer for your question.
[07:42.060 --> 07:47.060]  Excuse that. I'm sorry if you heard that come through the microphone. I do apologize. Excuse me.
[07:47.060 --> 07:52.060]  Here is the answer. I would not gradually slowly change the timer.
[07:52.060 --> 07:56.060]  I wouldn't do that. That's probably going to be more confusing, more stressful to the plants.
[07:56.060 --> 08:00.060]  I myself would, let's see the lights go off at 9am.
[08:00.060 --> 08:03.060]  When they go off at 9am, unplug them.
[08:03.060 --> 08:08.060]  Leave them unplugged. Let that 9pm, let's see. I'm reading this wrong. Let me back up.
[08:08.060 --> 08:11.060]  Normally the lights would go off at 6pm.
[08:11.060 --> 08:15.060]  So when they go off at 6pm today, unplug them.
[08:15.060 --> 08:18.060]  Let them stay unplugged all the way until the next 6pm.
[08:18.060 --> 08:21.060]  Now you've done 24 hours of total darkness.
[08:21.060 --> 08:23.060]  They got their 12 hours of sleep time.
[08:23.060 --> 08:25.060]  They're not going to freak out too much on you.
[08:25.060 --> 08:30.060]  Now what I would do is I would plug them in, turn them back on at 9pm.
[08:30.060 --> 08:34.060]  So you're going to go, 24 would be 6, you're going to go 27 hours.
[08:34.060 --> 08:39.060]  You're going to go about 27 hours of total darkness before you get them back on their normal schedule.
[08:39.060 --> 08:45.060]  But that is much less stressful to the plants than manipulating the timer a little bit every day.
[08:45.060 --> 08:48.060]  They're not going to know what's going on if you manipulate it a little bit every day.
[08:48.060 --> 08:53.060]  And they're constantly going to try to adjust and catch up with your changes and your manipulation.
[08:53.060 --> 08:55.060]  And that will not make the plants happy.
[08:55.060 --> 08:58.060]  The way to bite the bullet, like I said, unplug that timer.
[08:58.060 --> 09:01.060]  Let it stay unplugged for the duration of the normal dark cycle.
[09:01.060 --> 09:04.060]  Let it go for another extended dark period.
[09:04.060 --> 09:07.060]  And then plug it in at 9pm when you want them to come on.
[09:07.060 --> 09:11.060]  The reason I say to do it for the extended dark and don't do the slow interval,
[09:11.060 --> 09:14.060]  is these plants are just going to get an extended dark period.
[09:14.060 --> 09:17.060]  They won't freak out too much on a long dark period.
[09:17.060 --> 09:18.060]  They'll think they just got a nap.
[09:18.060 --> 09:20.060]  They may just think that it was a cloudy day.
[09:20.060 --> 09:22.060]  They didn't get any photons for that day.
[09:22.060 --> 09:29.060]  I find more problems, more errors, more potential for intersex traits when we manipulate the timer too drastically too many times.
[09:29.060 --> 09:30.060]  This is one big switch.
[09:30.060 --> 09:34.060]  They're going to take a long nap and then they're going to wake up and they'll be back on schedule.
[09:34.060 --> 09:35.060]  Just like a person.
[09:35.060 --> 09:41.060]  I think if you wanted to, if I changed my schedule from 9am to 9pm and you wanted me to work nights tomorrow,
[09:41.060 --> 09:46.060]  I'd probably just try to sleep a long time and then wake up and be refreshed for my brand new shift.
[09:46.060 --> 09:48.060]  I think your plants are going to like it this way.
[09:49.060 --> 09:52.060]  Let me make sure I read the times right because I want to give you the correct times.
[09:52.060 --> 09:55.060]  They currently come on at 6 and go off at 6.
[09:55.060 --> 09:58.060]  So at 6pm when they go off, unplug that timer.
[09:58.060 --> 10:00.060]  Let them run for 24 full hours off.
[10:00.060 --> 10:02.060]  Now you're back at 6pm.
[10:02.060 --> 10:07.060]  You want to turn them on at 9, wait that extra 3 hours and turn them right back on and start your new schedule there.
[10:07.060 --> 10:10.060]  Make sure you've got that new timer set from 9 to 9.
[10:10.060 --> 10:14.060]  Make sure any other timer you've got, maybe you've got some pumps, some blowers, some fans,
[10:14.060 --> 10:16.060]  maybe you've got some other stuff set up.
[10:16.060 --> 10:19.060]  Make sure that those timers are all adjusted as well.
[10:19.060 --> 10:23.060]  Now that you're running your lights at night, you may want to walk around the exterior of your grow.
[10:23.060 --> 10:25.060]  I don't know if that, I've got a window right here.
[10:25.060 --> 10:31.060]  If my grow space was right here, I would go outside at night and make sure you can't see any light through that window.
[10:31.060 --> 10:36.060]  Also, during the daytime, I would go in the grow and turn off all of the lights and stand in there for a few minutes
[10:36.060 --> 10:42.060]  and make sure none of the sunshine is coming from that window into my grow during their new dark period.
[10:42.060 --> 10:45.060]  So there are some things to investigate, some things to check and things to adjust.
[10:45.060 --> 10:51.060]  But I do think your plants will respond and react quite well to the longer, what are we going to give them?
[10:51.060 --> 10:53.060]  27 hours of darkness it looks like.
[10:53.060 --> 10:57.060]  I think they will be just fine with that extended dark period.
[10:57.060 --> 10:59.060]  You motherfucking hog, good luck to you.
[10:59.060 --> 11:03.060]  I hope this goes well and congratulations on getting the wife in the garden with you.
[11:03.060 --> 11:05.060]  That is going to be a good experience.
[11:05.060 --> 11:09.060]  Teach her well, be patient and let her learn and then get her listening to the podcast with you.
[11:09.060 --> 11:12.060]  That'll be some great family bonding.
[11:12.060 --> 11:14.060]  All right, I do have another message right in front of me.
[11:14.060 --> 11:16.060]  There's no need to slow down.
[11:16.060 --> 11:18.060]  This one comes from our friend.
[11:18.060 --> 11:19.060]  Let's see, he wants to be called.
[11:19.060 --> 11:20.060]  Used to be cool.
[11:20.060 --> 11:23.060]  Shout out to my buddy, Used to be cool for sending me all these great messages.
[11:23.060 --> 11:25.060]  We do have great correspondence.
[11:25.060 --> 11:28.060]  The message goes a lot like this.
[11:28.060 --> 11:31.060]  If you read this on the show, please don't use my real name.
[11:31.060 --> 11:33.060]  We've got you used to, we've discovered your alias.
[11:33.060 --> 11:35.060]  It says, by the way, your new set is really nice.
[11:35.060 --> 11:36.060]  Thank you.
[11:36.060 --> 11:37.060]  I do appreciate that.
[11:37.060 --> 11:41.060]  If you're a new viewer, a new watcher, a new listener, we got some new stuff here at the start of the year.
[11:41.060 --> 11:43.060]  We got a fresh new table, got some new paint.
[11:43.060 --> 11:44.060]  Things are looking good.
[11:44.060 --> 11:46.060]  It's exciting to be in the new set.
[11:46.060 --> 11:48.060]  Anyway, I'm rambling, so we'll keep moving.
[11:48.060 --> 11:52.060]  It says, I hope you see this soon, but it probably won't matter at this point.
[11:52.060 --> 11:57.060]  Instead of waiting to get this on the show, I actually replied directly to our friend, Used to be cool.
[11:57.060 --> 11:59.060]  So we did get an answer right away.
[11:59.060 --> 12:06.060]  It says, I've had a major league herm issue in my flowering tent, and I can't figure out what I've done to cause it.
[12:06.060 --> 12:08.060]  I'll give you some background first.
[12:08.060 --> 12:11.060]  It is a cheap four by four tent, and it does have light leaks.
[12:11.060 --> 12:14.060]  You've already named a big part of your problem.
[12:14.060 --> 12:15.060]  Cheap tent, light leaks.
[12:15.060 --> 12:17.060]  Those are things we can avoid.
[12:17.060 --> 12:18.060]  We can fix.
[12:18.060 --> 12:20.060]  Let's get a better tent and not have light leaks.
[12:20.060 --> 12:23.060]  But it is a completely dark room while the lights are out.
[12:23.060 --> 12:27.060]  Hopefully, hopefully, it says I have thoroughly checked this.
[12:27.060 --> 12:28.060]  Well, then I'm going to believe you.
[12:28.060 --> 12:37.060]  It says I was supposed to get a new gorilla tent prior to the start of flowering cycle, but after waiting two months for it to arrive, it had a defective part.
[12:37.060 --> 12:41.060]  Isn't that a bummer when you order grow gear and you're on a deadline and the shit comes and it's broken?
[12:41.060 --> 12:43.060]  Oh, that's so frustrating.
[12:43.060 --> 12:45.060]  Don't get me started on a rant because we could go all day on that.
[12:45.060 --> 12:51.060]  It says I'm supposed to get a replacement part on Monday after only waiting another month for it to come.
[12:51.060 --> 12:56.060]  So I went into flowering the old tent one more time, one last time.
[12:56.060 --> 12:57.060]  Understandable.
[12:57.060 --> 12:59.060]  Sometimes you've got to do what we've got to do.
[12:59.060 --> 13:01.060]  But I think you know where you're getting light leaks.
[13:01.060 --> 13:04.060]  You've already said that tent is cheap and has light leaks in it.
[13:04.060 --> 13:06.060]  Are you sure that that room is completely dark?
[13:06.060 --> 13:09.060]  Are you going in that room to get something to check on something?
[13:09.060 --> 13:11.060]  Is that other room getting lit up randomly at night?
[13:11.060 --> 13:14.060]  Are you the only person in the home or the building where this happens?
[13:14.060 --> 13:17.060]  Maybe somebody else is going in there and you don't know about it and they're flipping on the light.
[13:17.060 --> 13:19.060]  Not accusing, just mentioning options.
[13:19.060 --> 13:28.060]  It goes on to say my setup is four HLG quantum board panels that I run at 130 watts each at approximately 18 inches above the tops of the plants.
[13:28.060 --> 13:29.060]  Sounds good so far.
[13:29.060 --> 13:33.060]  The four separate panels allow my flexibility with plants of varying heights.
[13:33.060 --> 13:34.060]  I see that.
[13:34.060 --> 13:39.060]  I grow in living soil with smaller plants in five gallon pots and the largest in sevens.
[13:39.060 --> 13:42.060]  I feed recharge and mammoth pea once a week.
[13:42.060 --> 13:45.060]  I water two to three times a week according to the need.
[13:45.060 --> 13:50.060]  I started with two clones of your Raphael, two clones of Mr. Soul Cindy 99.
[13:50.060 --> 13:54.060]  And then I'm not going to read the other ones because I do know that the other ones did harm.
[13:54.060 --> 14:01.060]  One clone of another strain, one clone of another strain from seed and two of something else from seed.
[14:01.060 --> 14:06.060]  It's easier to tell you what didn't harm the Raphael's and the Cindy 99's did not harm.
[14:06.060 --> 14:08.060]  Big shout out to Mr. Soul.
[14:08.060 --> 14:11.060]  Your genetics and my genetics didn't harm in this person's garden.
[14:11.060 --> 14:13.060]  They got a whole list of other stuff that did.
[14:13.060 --> 14:14.060]  So shout out, Mr. Soul.
[14:14.060 --> 14:15.060]  You're doing good work.
[14:15.060 --> 14:19.060]  It says everything but these were smaller plants and he did list some plants.
[14:19.060 --> 14:24.060]  And I'm not going to say the names of them because I don't need to call out these other breeders and other seed companies for having hermaphroditic plants.
[14:24.060 --> 14:25.060]  That's not what this is about.
[14:25.060 --> 14:26.060]  That's not what I'm here for.
[14:26.060 --> 14:29.060]  It says today was day 22 of flower.
[14:29.060 --> 14:32.060]  My habit is to check all of my plants on day 15 for problems.
[14:32.060 --> 14:34.060]  I also do leaf on day 15.
[14:34.060 --> 14:36.060]  Good strategy so far.
[14:36.060 --> 14:37.060]  No pollen.
[14:37.060 --> 14:40.060]  No pollen sacks were detected on the plants on day 15.
[14:40.060 --> 14:43.060]  However, I just had a feeling I should check them again today.
[14:43.060 --> 14:46.060]  And I found pollen sack.
[14:46.060 --> 14:48.060]  So we've got some male plants popping up on your female plants.
[14:48.060 --> 14:50.060]  Not a good thing.
[14:50.060 --> 14:51.060]  It says two.
[14:51.060 --> 14:55.060]  Two were so covered that I destroyed them immediately.
[14:56.060 --> 14:59.060]  The other two I hoped I could save by cutting off little limbs of the pollen sacks.
[14:59.060 --> 15:02.060]  The sacks were all in the bottom half of those plants.
[15:02.060 --> 15:04.060]  That's a good strategy.
[15:04.060 --> 15:08.060]  That lower plant may herm more early, more easily because it's not getting as much light.
[15:08.060 --> 15:15.060]  But if they're herming that heavily that quickly, it's just going to move around and I would just get rid of them because I don't want that to cause more problems.
[15:15.060 --> 15:21.060]  It says the reason I wrote is to see if I have any chance of saving the surviving hermed plants.
[15:21.060 --> 15:26.060]  I'm certain the pollen has been spread to other plants, but I'm not sure how badly the other plants will be seeded.
[15:26.060 --> 15:34.060]  Is there any chance no more pollen sacks will grow and these plants can be saved or should I just destroy the ones that hermed?
[15:34.060 --> 15:36.060]  They'll probably keep making male parts.
[15:36.060 --> 15:38.060]  They're already triggered.
[15:38.060 --> 15:40.060]  They already have that trait.
[15:40.060 --> 15:42.060]  Once somebody shows you it's an asshole, it's an asshole.
[15:42.060 --> 15:45.060]  It's not going to just stop being an asshole because you want it to.
[15:45.060 --> 15:47.060]  Nothing's going to change in there.
[15:47.060 --> 15:49.060]  These plants are going to be assholes until the day they die.
[15:49.060 --> 15:51.060]  They're probably going to keep making male plants.
[15:51.060 --> 15:53.060]  It goes on to say, thank you for any advice you can give.
[15:53.060 --> 15:55.060]  I hope you have a great 2021.
[15:55.060 --> 16:02.060]  My 2020 sucked ass and I hope I never see another year like that again from our friend used to be cool.
[16:02.060 --> 16:04.060]  Bro, I apologize that your 2020 sucked.
[16:04.060 --> 16:06.060]  I hope we can make 2021 better.
[16:06.060 --> 16:09.060]  Hopefully we can fix the garden and quit having light leaks and herm issues.
[16:09.060 --> 16:14.060]  So I told him that the problem was most likely light leaks is what I explained in an email.
[16:14.060 --> 16:17.060]  I did reply via email to get a quick answer to my friend.
[16:17.060 --> 16:22.060]  And he said, I do understand that, but can you tell me some of the major causes of hermaphroditism?
[16:22.060 --> 16:25.060]  So I did kind of change the direction of this message.
[16:25.060 --> 16:31.060]  And we're going to talk about things that I believe will lead to intersex traits in our cannabis garden.
[16:31.060 --> 16:37.060]  One of the things that I wrote on my notes is he's trying to save these plants.
[16:37.060 --> 16:39.060]  He wants to cut off some branches and rescue them and have a harvest.
[16:39.060 --> 16:43.060]  I said, with all of the options available, why keep troublemakers around?
[16:43.060 --> 16:44.060]  Those are asshole plants.
[16:44.060 --> 16:46.060]  Let's get rid of them and have a positive garden.
[16:46.060 --> 16:47.060]  So I wouldn't even waste time with those.
[16:47.060 --> 16:52.060]  If you've got the option, I would just call them, count your losses now, get rid of them.
[16:52.060 --> 16:53.060]  Of course, your crops already seeded.
[16:53.060 --> 16:57.060]  So if you do want to finish them out, the crops are already going to have seeds in it.
[16:57.060 --> 16:59.060]  So you can keep them going, but I would get rid of them.
[16:59.060 --> 17:01.060]  I don't need troublemakers in my garden.
[17:01.060 --> 17:03.060]  I would get rid of them immediately.
[17:03.060 --> 17:11.060]  Now let's talk about the causes of intersex traits, hermaphroditic plants, male and female traits on the same plant, possibly the same branch.
[17:11.060 --> 17:13.060]  Let's talk about what causes this.
[17:14.060 --> 17:18.060]  Basically, I wrote down genetics plus environment equals expression.
[17:18.060 --> 17:22.060]  So you've got genetics that hold the potential to show intersex traits.
[17:22.060 --> 17:24.060]  You give them the right environment.
[17:24.060 --> 17:27.060]  That's when they will express their intersex traits.
[17:27.060 --> 17:29.060]  We can bring out a lot of things in plants.
[17:29.060 --> 17:30.060]  We can bring out colors.
[17:30.060 --> 17:31.060]  We can bring out turps.
[17:31.060 --> 17:34.060]  We can bring out flavors, aromas, structures, potency.
[17:34.060 --> 17:40.060]  We can also bring out this intersex hermaphroditic trait if the plant does hold that trait.
[17:40.060 --> 17:44.060]  So what are the causes of intersex plants?
[17:44.060 --> 17:45.060]  I said genetics.
[17:45.060 --> 17:49.060]  Some plants are just genetically intersex plants.
[17:49.060 --> 17:52.060]  They were bred from plants that contain an intersex trait.
[17:52.060 --> 17:59.060]  If one of your plants in your breeding project has an intersex trait, you've got the opportunity to pass that trait along.
[17:59.060 --> 18:01.060]  It could be a recessive trait.
[18:01.060 --> 18:05.060]  If your great-grandparent plant had that trait, it might not show up in the grandparent.
[18:05.060 --> 18:09.060]  It might not show up in the parent, but it may show up in the next progeny.
[18:09.060 --> 18:17.060]  It may be hidden for several generations, but that intersex trait is a trait, and that comes from poorly selected plants when breeding.
[18:17.060 --> 18:20.060]  Plants need to be tested for intersex traits before we breed with them.
[18:20.060 --> 18:26.060]  Also, after seeds are made, you need to grow them and make sure that those plants don't possess the intersex trait.
[18:26.060 --> 18:28.060]  If they do, they shouldn't be sold.
[18:28.060 --> 18:29.060]  They shouldn't be released.
[18:29.060 --> 18:35.060]  They should be grown by a private grower in his own garden who knows what he's created, who's willing and ready and able to take that risk.
[18:35.060 --> 18:38.060]  So a lot of it is just genetic.
[18:38.060 --> 18:41.060]  What else could be causing these hermaphrodites?
[18:41.060 --> 18:45.060]  Poorly bred plants, then we put them in a room and we give them the environment.
[18:45.060 --> 18:47.060]  Now let's talk about the environment.
[18:47.060 --> 18:51.060]  Environmental triggers that will cause our plants to show intersex traits.
[18:51.060 --> 18:52.060]  I've mentioned this a lot.
[18:52.060 --> 18:58.060]  Light interruptions in the flowering phase are notorious for causing intersex traits in our plants.
[18:58.060 --> 19:01.060]  That is one way that I test my plants for intersex traits.
[19:01.060 --> 19:03.060]  I give them light stress.
[19:03.060 --> 19:09.060]  So if you've got a dark period, your dark period should be 12 hours of uninterrupted light or uninterrupted darkness.
[19:09.060 --> 19:10.060]  I apologize.
[19:10.060 --> 19:13.060]  Or possibly 13 hours, depending on what schedule you've chosen to go to.
[19:13.060 --> 19:15.060]  Do not interrupt that.
[19:15.060 --> 19:21.060]  If you have to turn on a light or walk in that room, you are running the risk of causing intersex traits in your plants.
[19:21.060 --> 19:29.060]  So light leaks and light interruptions are, in my opinion, one of the leading causes of intersex traits in our plants.
[19:29.060 --> 19:33.060]  Another major cause is too much heat.
[19:33.060 --> 19:43.060]  If you get these plants too hot early in flower, you can always cause them the opportunity to go intersex, to throw male plants on our female flowers.
[19:43.060 --> 19:47.060]  Too much heat is a good cause of intersex traits.
[19:47.060 --> 19:55.060]  Root stress, overwatering, sitting in cold water, sitting in stagnant water, sitting in cold water, sitting in too warm of water.
[19:55.060 --> 20:02.060]  All of these things can cause stress to the root zone, which in turn will make our plants show intersex traits.
[20:02.060 --> 20:07.060]  These plants, the main goal of a cannabis plant for the plant itself is to reproduce.
[20:07.060 --> 20:09.060]  It wants to grow.
[20:09.060 --> 20:10.060]  It wants to get pollinated.
[20:10.060 --> 20:13.060]  It wants to make seeds and it wants to be grown again next year.
[20:13.060 --> 20:16.060]  Cannabis plants have this magical trait.
[20:16.060 --> 20:24.060]  If they are not pollinated, if you keep growing them long enough, they will do everything that they can to produce their own seeds to grow next year.
[20:24.060 --> 20:31.060]  If we give these plants the triggers, they are more than ready to create seeds on their own and continue their generations.
[20:31.060 --> 20:33.060]  These plants are survivors.
[20:33.060 --> 20:40.060]  Your goal is to produce big, fat, beefy buds with ripe trichomes and amazing aromas and amazing flavors and a nice buzz.
[20:40.060 --> 20:42.060]  The plant's whole goal is to reproduce.
[20:42.060 --> 20:52.060]  We are tricking it into not reproducing by not putting pollen near it, but the plants do hold the trait that they can unlock within themselves to become self-sufficient and create seeds on their own.
[20:52.060 --> 20:56.060]  We have to avoid the environment and the triggers for that to happen.
[20:56.060 --> 21:02.060]  Don't keep your plant too wet, too cold, too dry, or in standing water for too long.
[21:02.060 --> 21:06.060]  Also, another cause of intersex traits can be overfeeding.
[21:06.060 --> 21:10.060]  If we overfeed these plants, they can say, hey, I don't know what's going on.
[21:10.060 --> 21:11.060]  I'm getting cooked.
[21:11.060 --> 21:15.060]  I'm just going to make some pollen sacks and try to reproduce and make some more seeds and try again next year.
[21:15.060 --> 21:21.060]  Overfeeding can put our plants into a panic mode that can cause intersex traits.
[21:21.060 --> 21:26.060]  Another major cause of intersex traits is bug infestations.
[21:26.060 --> 21:34.060]  I've seen infestations in commercial grows and private grows where they've hired me to go help that the plants are so stressed they are beginning to hermaphrodite on you.
[21:34.060 --> 21:43.060]  So if you've got bugs and the bugs are real bad, it is time to get rid of the bugs, get some predators in there, or consider just chopping that shit down and starting over.
[21:43.060 --> 21:50.060]  If you're starting to see intersex traits because your bugs are so bad, you really need to step up your integrated pest management system.
[21:50.060 --> 21:59.060]  Another thing that can cause plants to go herm on us or show intersex traits is just basic stress, basic surprises.
[21:59.060 --> 22:02.060]  We talked earlier about just changing a timer two hours a day.
[22:02.060 --> 22:03.060]  That's basic stress.
[22:03.060 --> 22:05.060]  Those plants don't want that two hours a day.
[22:05.060 --> 22:09.060]  That's why I recommended go a long dark period, let them sleep, then wake them up fresh.
[22:09.060 --> 22:23.060]  If we keep doing a bunch of random chaotic shit to them, drastic swings in temperature, drastic swings in feeding solution temperature, drastic swings in humidity, those things will trigger the intersex traits in our plant.
[22:23.060 --> 22:25.060]  They'll say, hey, I don't know what's going on, man.
[22:25.060 --> 22:26.060]  Is it the end of the world?
[22:26.060 --> 22:27.060]  I'm getting stressed out.
[22:27.060 --> 22:29.060]  Something bad is going to happen to me.
[22:29.060 --> 22:30.060]  I must reproduce.
[22:30.060 --> 22:33.060]  We must continue our generation for the next year.
[22:34.060 --> 22:40.060]  They will figure out a way to go hermaphrodite on you and make some seeds so that they can grow again next year.
[22:40.060 --> 22:43.060]  All right.
[22:43.060 --> 22:44.060]  Just had to check my timing.
[22:44.060 --> 22:48.060]  So those are most of the major causes of intersex traits.
[22:48.060 --> 22:53.060]  In my opinion, I'm sure there are other things that will cause intersex traits to appear in your plants.
[22:53.060 --> 22:58.060]  If the plant holds the intersex trait, it just depends on how strong that trait is.
[22:58.060 --> 23:00.060]  Sometimes we see purple in plants.
[23:00.060 --> 23:01.060]  Sometimes we don't see purple.
[23:01.060 --> 23:02.060]  Sometimes we see intersex.
[23:02.060 --> 23:03.060]  Sometimes we don't.
[23:03.060 --> 23:05.060]  It's a trait that can be carried in the plant.
[23:05.060 --> 23:07.060]  Sometimes it's a strong gene.
[23:07.060 --> 23:09.060]  Sometimes it's a not so strong gene.
[23:09.060 --> 23:14.060]  It just depends on if you give the proper environment to trigger that trait in that plant.
[23:14.060 --> 23:15.060]  All right.
[23:15.060 --> 23:18.060]  I'm going to read one more message before we start wrapping up this podcast.
[23:18.060 --> 23:21.060]  And this one goes just like this.
[23:21.060 --> 23:25.060]  It says, hey, Ross to Jeff, I've been using your gear for a little bit and it's fire.
[23:25.060 --> 23:28.060]  Thank you for the compliments and I'm glad you're having success with my seeds.
[23:28.060 --> 23:31.060]  It goes on to say, I'm currently running a two tent setup.
[23:31.060 --> 23:33.060]  I've got a four by four and a five by five.
[23:33.060 --> 23:35.060]  Great setup so far.
[23:35.060 --> 23:38.060]  It says both are running Spider Farmer SF 400 lights.
[23:38.060 --> 23:40.060]  One is stuffed with Golden Goat.
[23:40.060 --> 23:46.060]  My question is, what are the pros and cons of taking down these two tents and putting up Panda Film to build a five by ten room?
[23:46.060 --> 23:51.060]  Is it better to have everyone together or is it better to run multiple tents?
[23:51.060 --> 23:55.060]  I'm on Cannabuzz, Name Prohibited and Organic Andy.
[23:55.060 --> 23:59.060]  Make sure you guys go follow Name Prohibited and Organic Andy on Cannabuzz.
[23:59.060 --> 24:00.060]  Shout out to my Cannabuzz crew.
[24:00.060 --> 24:01.060]  This is a great question.
[24:01.060 --> 24:07.060]  Our friend has two tents and they are wondering if they should just take down the two tents and build one big room.
[24:07.060 --> 24:10.060]  There are pros and cons to both of those things.
[24:10.060 --> 24:13.060]  Having one big room means you've got one big room to work with.
[24:13.060 --> 24:15.060]  I am six foot five.
[24:15.060 --> 24:16.060]  I don't fit in a grow tent.
[24:16.060 --> 24:19.060]  Trying to stand up in a grow tent is a pain in the ass for me.
[24:19.060 --> 24:21.060]  I prefer a big room.
[24:21.060 --> 24:24.060]  However, I've got a big grow room with a grow tent in it.
[24:24.060 --> 24:25.060]  What?
[24:25.060 --> 24:26.060]  I know that's weird, right?
[24:26.060 --> 24:33.060]  I've got a breeding room where I keep all of the females in one section and the male plant goes in a tent so that I can control his environment separately.
[24:33.060 --> 24:36.060]  I can get him flowering before everybody else.
[24:36.060 --> 24:42.060]  I've also got a filter in there so I can suck out the pollen so that the pollen doesn't get to my female plants too early.
[24:42.060 --> 24:45.060]  So I've got a grow room with a grow tent in it.
[24:45.060 --> 24:47.060]  I've got a lot of experience using tents.
[24:47.060 --> 24:51.060]  I've got a lot of experience using bedrooms or basements converted into grow spaces.
[24:51.060 --> 24:55.060]  I've also got a lot of experience turning giant warehouses into grow spaces.
[24:55.060 --> 24:58.060]  So I do see the pros and cons of both.
[24:58.060 --> 25:03.060]  If you have the small spaces, that is less trimming at one time.
[25:03.060 --> 25:11.060]  You may be able to set that up on a perpetual grow, but if you've got one tent that finishes at one time and another that finishes another, you know that these are going to get trimmed.
[25:11.060 --> 25:13.060]  You can put a veg space in here.
[25:13.060 --> 25:14.060]  You can run flower in here.
[25:14.060 --> 25:16.060]  You can have two different light cycles.
[25:16.060 --> 25:17.060]  That's really advantageous.
[25:17.060 --> 25:20.060]  You don't have one harvest at one time and you've got two light cycles.
[25:20.060 --> 25:23.060]  So now you can have one vegging, one flowering.
[25:23.060 --> 25:27.060]  You can always have 130 days into flower, 130 days or just starting.
[25:27.060 --> 25:29.060]  So you can have offset schedules there.
[25:29.060 --> 25:31.060]  That's advantageous.
[25:31.060 --> 25:33.060]  Power consumption.
[25:33.060 --> 25:38.060]  If you've got two small tents, you only need to control the environment in those two small tents.
[25:38.060 --> 25:41.060]  If you build a big room, you've got to power the big room.
[25:41.060 --> 25:44.060]  Also, you may need to climate control the two tents differently.
[25:44.060 --> 25:46.060]  You've got two different sizes.
[25:46.060 --> 25:47.060]  One's going to get more humid than the other.
[25:47.060 --> 25:49.060]  How are you moving that air around?
[25:49.060 --> 25:55.060]  If you take the tents down, you've got one big room with one constant humidity and VPD going on in the room.
[25:55.060 --> 25:57.060]  So that's a couple of things to think about.
[25:57.060 --> 26:03.060]  It is much easier to dial in a small room than it is to dial in a large room.
[26:03.060 --> 26:12.060]  Also, if you've got those two tents, maybe you've got some plants that like a lot of humidity or plants that like real low humidity.
[26:12.060 --> 26:14.060]  You can put those in two different tents.
[26:14.060 --> 26:18.060]  Maybe you want to reduce the light cycle or increase the light cycle on one tent.
[26:18.060 --> 26:19.060]  You can do that with the two different tents.
[26:19.060 --> 26:22.060]  You cannot do that in one big room.
[26:22.060 --> 26:25.060]  I mentioned before, I'm too fucking tall for a grow tent.
[26:25.060 --> 26:28.060]  So if you made me grow in a bunch of grow tents, I'm going to get cramped.
[26:28.060 --> 26:30.060]  I'm going to get frustrated.
[26:30.060 --> 26:32.060]  The plants in the back are not going to get as much work.
[26:32.060 --> 26:34.060]  They're not going to get as much attention.
[26:34.060 --> 26:36.060]  The plants up front are going to look stellar.
[26:36.060 --> 26:38.060]  The stuff I can't get to is going to be a mess.
[26:38.060 --> 26:41.060]  If I'm in a room, I can walk around every single plant.
[26:41.060 --> 26:42.060]  I can look at every plant.
[26:42.060 --> 26:44.060]  I don't have to keep ducking and bumping my head on shit.
[26:44.060 --> 26:47.060]  So I think that the rooms are better for me.
[26:48.060 --> 26:52.060]  If you've got the grow tents, that is one more layer of protection.
[26:52.060 --> 26:57.060]  You're not going to get as many opportunities for light leaks like we talked about earlier in your grow tent.
[26:57.060 --> 26:59.060]  The grow tent is in a room.
[26:59.060 --> 27:01.060]  You can black out the tent, and then you can turn off the lights in the room.
[27:01.060 --> 27:03.060]  You know that you are double dark.
[27:03.060 --> 27:08.060]  If you have that no tent environment and you walk into that room, you open up that door,
[27:08.060 --> 27:09.060]  there is a light leak in there.
[27:09.060 --> 27:11.060]  The plants are exposed.
[27:11.060 --> 27:13.060]  So there are a couple of options to that.
[27:13.060 --> 27:14.060]  Both work great.
[27:14.060 --> 27:16.060]  It's all about finding what works best for you.
[27:16.060 --> 27:20.060]  If you want that one big room that is super comfortable, that is easy to work in,
[27:20.060 --> 27:24.060]  but you can't have separate light cycles, you can't have separate environments,
[27:24.060 --> 27:28.060]  and if you get an infestation of bugs, it's definitely in the entire room.
[27:28.060 --> 27:30.060]  Sometimes you can contain things to one tent.
[27:30.060 --> 27:34.060]  My favorite part about having the tent is that you can veg in one area,
[27:34.060 --> 27:37.060]  you can flower in another, or you can have staggered flowering rooms.
[27:37.060 --> 27:41.060]  If you've got a big enough room to fit the 5x5 and the 4x4,
[27:42.060 --> 27:48.060]  what I would almost suggest is use the 5x5 and the 4x4 as two staggered flowering rooms.
[27:48.060 --> 27:52.060]  So you've got one that starts on the first of the month, and then wait a full month
[27:52.060 --> 27:53.060]  and let that flower 30 days.
[27:53.060 --> 27:56.060]  The first of the next month, get that one flowering.
[27:56.060 --> 27:58.060]  Now every 30 days you've got a crop.
[27:58.060 --> 28:03.060]  Now you've got the rest of that bedroom or whatever the room is to use as a veg and clone and mom area.
[28:03.060 --> 28:06.060]  You've just bought yourself a veg and clone space.
[28:06.060 --> 28:10.060]  So flower in the two tents and use the rest of the bedroom, the rest of the basement,
[28:10.060 --> 28:11.060]  as the rest of your grow.
[28:11.060 --> 28:15.060]  Those veg plants, they can be under 24, 18, 6 of lights.
[28:15.060 --> 28:19.060]  So you can just put them in that room, and then you've got your tents for 12, 12 for blackout.
[28:19.060 --> 28:24.060]  As long as your tents don't have light leaks, you just created two perpetual flowering areas
[28:24.060 --> 28:28.060]  that are off staggered cycles, and you've got a full veg area.
[28:28.060 --> 28:37.060]  So if that were my space, I would have a 4x4, a 5x5, and a veg room inside of that grow space.
[28:37.060 --> 28:42.060]  I don't know if you've got full access to the whole room or whatnot, but that is what I would do.
[28:42.060 --> 28:46.060]  So having tents is good because you can have separate environments.
[28:46.060 --> 28:50.060]  If you've got a problem in one tent, you may not have a problem in another tent.
[28:50.060 --> 28:52.060]  You can do different things in different tents.
[28:52.060 --> 28:57.060]  You can have longer light cycle, shorter light cycle, or you can have one big room where it's much easier to work,
[28:57.060 --> 28:59.060]  and you don't need as much equipment.
[28:59.060 --> 29:01.060]  So those are some of the pros and cons.
[29:01.060 --> 29:04.060]  My biggest thing is that I'm too big for the grow tents.
[29:05.060 --> 29:08.060]  I am just too big for them, so I can't go in there and get the work.
[29:08.060 --> 29:09.060]  I can't stand up in a grow tent.
[29:09.060 --> 29:11.060]  I can stand up in my grow rooms.
[29:11.060 --> 29:13.060]  I can't stand up in the tents.
[29:13.060 --> 29:14.060]  I like both environments.
[29:14.060 --> 29:16.060]  There's nothing wrong with growing in tents.
[29:16.060 --> 29:19.060]  I see a lot of people on social media bash grow tents.
[29:19.060 --> 29:22.060]  People that have bigger environments say, oh, you're just a tent grower.
[29:22.060 --> 29:23.060]  Tents are amazing.
[29:23.060 --> 29:25.060]  Don't ever let a tent discourage you.
[29:25.060 --> 29:31.060]  But I'm going to read this again and see if I've got any more suggestions I can make based on what you wrote.
[29:31.060 --> 29:36.060]  No, I think it's going to be easier to dial in the two tents separately for custom cultivars,
[29:36.060 --> 29:39.060]  but also I like the big room because it's just easier to work in.
[29:39.060 --> 29:44.060]  So once again, my wrap-up is I would have the two tents on staggered cycles,
[29:44.060 --> 29:48.060]  maybe one run during the day and one during the night so that you can have 12-12 in both tents
[29:48.060 --> 29:53.060]  and have them both constantly flowering, which will save you on power consumption, honestly.
[29:53.060 --> 29:58.060]  I used to run two 5x5 tents in one room, and one would come on at 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
[29:58.060 --> 30:00.060]  The other would be 9 p.m. to 9 a.m.
[30:00.060 --> 30:06.060]  I did not have to upgrade the electrical in that room, and I was still able to run both of my tents with a 1,000-watt light in there.
[30:06.060 --> 30:08.060]  That's the old antique dinosaur lights.
[30:08.060 --> 30:09.060]  I used to run thousands.
[30:09.060 --> 30:11.060]  Of course, now I've upgraded to LEDs.
[30:11.060 --> 30:15.060]  I feel like I'm rambling, but again, I would do the two tents for flower
[30:15.060 --> 30:19.060]  and use the rest of the room as a veg space if that is an option.
[30:19.060 --> 30:23.060]  If not, I would stick with the two tents because it sounds like you've got good control
[30:23.060 --> 30:26.060]  and a layer to protect from light leaks.
[30:26.060 --> 30:29.060]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
