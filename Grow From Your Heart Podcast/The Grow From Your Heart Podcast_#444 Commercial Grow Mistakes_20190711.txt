[00:00.000 --> 00:23.240]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World. It is time for episode 444 of the Grow From Your
[00:23.240 --> 00:27.560]  Heart Podcast. This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Seeds Here
[00:27.560 --> 00:32.440]  Now. If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you
[00:32.440 --> 00:40.040]  can find them at www.seedsherenow.com. It has become a tradition that we start this
[00:40.040 --> 00:45.280]  podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking. Today, I've been taking dabs of pre-98 Bubba
[00:45.280 --> 00:52.040]  Kush batter, and I'm dunking that batter in the GG4 Turps, and I'm also sticking GG4 Diamonds
[00:52.040 --> 00:57.400]  into that mix. Let's read these potency labels a little bit. The pre-98 Bubba Kush batter,
[00:57.400 --> 01:05.040]  the potency label says this product contains 61% THC and 72.2% total cannabinoids. The
[01:05.040 --> 01:15.000]  GG4 is listed at 68.8% THC and 79.1% total cannabinoids. That makes for a wonderful combo.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.560]  The batter really punches you in the lungs. That pre-98 Bubba Kush is a little indica-heavy,
[01:19.560 --> 01:23.840]  so it makes you a little lazy. It relaxes you. And then you get that head punch and
[01:23.840 --> 01:28.400]  that brain spin from the GG4. It is a really delicious, really potent combo. It really
[01:28.400 --> 01:32.880]  puts me in a great mood for podcasting. So giant shout out to our friends from Apothecary
[01:32.880 --> 01:39.520]  Farms. I'm sure you notice I've got some music in the background. I don't usually play music
[01:39.520 --> 01:44.280]  on the show, usually because that causes problems on the YouTube channel. But today, I was in
[01:44.280 --> 01:47.680]  the mood to groove a little bit, so we've got some music in the background. Big shout
[01:47.680 --> 01:50.640]  out to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band for letting me use their music on my show.
[01:50.640 --> 01:54.880]  It's been a long time since we've heard from them. Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
[01:54.880 --> 01:58.560]  I'm going to talk about more common grow room mistakes, but I'm going to talk about things
[01:58.560 --> 02:02.040]  that I've seen in commercial facilities, and I will talk about things that I've seen in
[02:02.040 --> 02:07.000]  small private grows. But before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few of my friends
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.360]  on Patreon. I want to start off with a big Giant Grow From Your Heart podcast. Shout
[02:11.360 --> 02:15.880]  out to Miss Mel. I want to give a big shout out to Keith K. I owe a big Giant Grow From

[02:57.120 --> 03:01.520]  of that instrumental track there. I did mention that we are going to talk about some common
[03:01.520 --> 03:06.840]  grow room mistakes. I also want to remind you that the DGC 710 Concentration Celebration
[03:06.840 --> 03:12.120]  is coming up. That's right. It will be 713 at Cultivated Synergy in Denver, Colorado.
[03:12.120 --> 03:16.000]  Join us. I would love to see your smile and face. I would love to give you a fat dab.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.240]  I will be all set up at Cultivated Synergy. I'll have my new booth set up. I'm excited
[03:20.240 --> 03:24.040]  to share that with the world. I will have some Iry Genetics t-shirts. I'll have a whole
[03:24.040 --> 03:28.920]  bunch of brand new Iry Genetics gear available. I will have the always lovely, always beautiful
[03:28.920 --> 03:34.160]  dabbing granny hanging out at my booth. There is a possibility of an appearance from our
[03:34.160 --> 03:38.040]  friend White Mike. And of course, the always beautiful Miss Amy will be at the booth with
[03:38.040 --> 03:44.640]  us. So drop by the Dude Grows Concentration Celebration on 713 at Cultivated Synergy in
[03:44.640 --> 03:49.280]  Denver, Colorado. Drop by the Iry Genetics booth. I look forward to seeing you there.
[03:49.280 --> 03:54.480]  The booth will be very easy to find. I am very easy to identify. That's a really good
[03:54.480 --> 03:56.640]  segue. That's a funny thing to talk about.
[03:56.640 --> 04:01.800]  I met somebody recently and they said, holy shit, dude, your voice and your appearance
[04:01.800 --> 04:05.760]  do not match one bit. And I thought that was really funny. They're a podcast listener.
[04:05.760 --> 04:08.880]  They've been listening for quite a while. Big shout out. They know who they are. I'm
[04:08.880 --> 04:13.720]  not sure if they want their name said on the show, but they were surprised at my appearance.
[04:13.720 --> 04:17.120]  I don't often speak of the way I look on the show because that's not what this show
[04:17.120 --> 04:21.960]  is about. But when you come see me at the Dude Grows Concentration Celebration, don't
[04:21.960 --> 04:27.040]  be intimidated. Don't be shy. I'm about six foot five. Yeah, I'm fucking tall. The first
[04:27.040 --> 04:31.240]  thing most people say when they meet me is, holy shit, you're tall. The second thing they
[04:31.240 --> 04:36.560]  say is, holy shit, your dreadlocks are long. Yeah, I'm a six foot five tall white guy with
[04:36.560 --> 04:43.120]  dreadlocks to my knees. I am really easy to recognize and identify. I'm also fucking obnoxious.
[04:43.120 --> 04:48.080]  I'm also really friendly. So come introduce yourself. Come shake my hand. Come say hi.
[04:48.080 --> 04:51.520]  Don't be shy. Don't be afraid of me. I'm a pretty kind dude. And come visit the booth.
[04:51.520 --> 04:55.320]  I want everybody to be friends with iRegenetics. If you listen to the show, if you support
[04:55.320 --> 04:59.840]  us in any way, come say hi. Don't be intimidated. All right. I thought it was funny when this
[04:59.840 --> 05:04.160]  person said, holy shit, your voice and your appearance do not match one bit. I really
[05:04.160 --> 05:07.960]  thought that was funny. Somebody stated that I sound very corporate and I look very not
[05:07.960 --> 05:13.040]  corporate. I guess that's a compliment. That means that I sound professional and I sound
[05:13.040 --> 05:17.160]  educated and I speak well and I'm not a dipshit. So that's a compliment. But then I look very
[05:17.160 --> 05:21.560]  not corporate. That's also a compliment too. Trust me. All right. I have two more quick
[05:21.560 --> 05:26.200]  things to cover before we get to the main topic of the show. The next one is the 7-10
[05:26.200 --> 05:31.120]  drop. That is right. On 7-10, a whole bunch of brand new Feminize seeds will drop. Make
[05:31.120 --> 05:37.040]  sure you check out seedsherenow.com. Make sure you check out Oregon Elite Seeds. And
[05:37.040 --> 05:44.320]  also make sure you check out dankseed.store for fresh drops of iRegenetics. Also, my last
[05:44.320 --> 05:49.120]  order of business before we get to the main topic, if you would like news and updates
[05:49.120 --> 05:54.080]  on fresh iRegenetics drops, if there are new strains coming out, if there are sales happening,
[05:54.080 --> 05:57.820]  if there are coupon codes happening, if there are promotions happening through social media
[05:57.820 --> 06:01.900]  or something like that, or if there is an event such as the Dude Grows Cup or another
[06:01.900 --> 06:06.840]  event where I may randomly choose to pop up, if you join my mailing list, I will keep you
[06:06.840 --> 06:13.840]  updated on all of those types of happenings. So send an email to iRegeneticsmailinglist
[06:13.840 --> 06:18.840]  at gmail.com. I'll add you to the mailing list. I'll keep you updated on seed drops,
[06:18.840 --> 06:24.200]  on sales, on promotions, on live events, on contests and giveaways, and any other random
[06:24.200 --> 06:28.000]  things that I think you may benefit from getting a heads up on.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.520]  All right, podcast world. I think that covers all of the business for the intro of the show.
[06:32.520 --> 06:36.720]  Let's get into the main topic of this podcast. I've said it a couple of times, but I want
[06:36.800 --> 06:42.280]  to talk about things that I've observed in grow rooms that I find to be easily correctable
[06:42.280 --> 06:47.480]  common mistakes. Just in case you're new to the show, let me build some credibility before
[06:47.480 --> 06:51.680]  I go talking about my commercial grow room environment. I have been in the commercial
[06:51.680 --> 06:58.880]  grow industry since 2008. I have been in the Colorado medical cannabis industry since 2007.
[06:58.880 --> 07:03.160]  I've been growing commercial cannabis for over 10 years now. I've been in many large
[07:03.160 --> 07:08.840]  facilities. I've been in many small facilities. I've ran facilities that average about 100
[07:08.840 --> 07:15.320]  lamps, but I have ran facilities that have over five, sometimes 700 lamps in one facility.
[07:15.320 --> 07:20.560]  I have held many positions in the legal cannabis industry. I have a lot of experience on the
[07:20.560 --> 07:25.800]  retail side. I was a bud tender. I was a manager. I did a lot of stuff in that side. My main
[07:25.800 --> 07:31.200]  focus is the cultivation side. I have worked as a grow tech. I have worked as a grow leader.
[07:31.240 --> 07:37.120]  I have worked as a lead grower for the entire facility. I've worked as a cultivation director.
[07:37.120 --> 07:42.880]  Now at this time, I'm working as a commercial cultivation contracted consultant. My main
[07:42.880 --> 07:50.180]  goal is to increase productivity in your commercial facility by 20 to 30% in a very short time.
[07:50.180 --> 07:53.760]  That doesn't necessarily mean that I'm simply going to increase harvest weights. There are
[07:53.760 --> 07:57.760]  a lot of things to be looked at when it comes to increasing productivity and overall profits
[07:57.760 --> 08:02.120]  in a commercial environment. Yes, your first goal is to get the grow up to speed. You need
[08:02.120 --> 08:07.800]  to set and reach production and potency goals. Then there are other ways we can find to save
[08:07.800 --> 08:12.240]  money in a commercial production facility. Can we do things a little more efficiently
[08:12.240 --> 08:16.860]  that will save us manpower? Can we do things more effectively that will make us order and
[08:16.860 --> 08:22.580]  waste less product and materials? There are always ways to increase productivity and increase
[08:22.580 --> 08:27.480]  overall profits in a grow environment. What I mainly do is I'm hired to go into a commercial
[08:27.520 --> 08:32.680]  facility. I'll walk around that facility and take a good tour, look at all of the equipment,
[08:32.680 --> 08:37.280]  write some notes, ask about all of the HVAC, ask about a few of their systems. Then I like
[08:37.280 --> 08:41.640]  to observe the employees. I watch everybody work for a day or two. I learn everybody's
[08:41.640 --> 08:46.520]  role. I see what everybody does. I find weaknesses. I see strengths. Then after a couple of days,
[08:46.520 --> 08:51.400]  I meet with management and I explain what is going on and where we can improve things.
[08:51.400 --> 08:55.840]  Then it's up to management to take my advice and actually implement my suggestions. But
[08:55.840 --> 09:00.400]  then we move from there. I have been doing this for several years in the state of Colorado.
[09:00.400 --> 09:05.360]  I am branching out to New Mexico. I have branched out to Oklahoma and I have got a large reach
[09:05.360 --> 09:10.200]  in Canada. So that should give me a little bit of credibility for why I feel like I should
[09:10.200 --> 09:15.920]  be able to talk about commercial cultivation and why I feel like I am able to identify
[09:15.920 --> 09:20.560]  and point out common mistakes that I see in grow environments.
[09:20.560 --> 09:25.160]  So now that I have got a little bit of street cred, a little bit of commercial grow credibility,
[09:25.160 --> 09:31.320]  let's talk about some of the mistakes I see in way too many facilities. One of the first
[09:31.320 --> 09:36.360]  things I notice when I walk into a commercial facility is that most of the places are a
[09:36.360 --> 09:43.800]  mess. Many of the grow facilities are disorganized and messy and that will lead to big problems
[09:43.800 --> 09:49.000]  down the road. I see a lot of facilities with messy floors. I see a lot of leaves on the
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.680]  floor like they just defoliated and threw that shit on the floor. I see a lot of tables
[09:53.720 --> 09:58.360]  that are clogged up with leaves. All of that dead, decaying leaf is not a good thing for
[09:58.360 --> 10:04.600]  your grow. Also, all of that leaf matter is a potentially sweet spot for a bug like a
[10:04.600 --> 10:09.560]  spider mite or a thrip or something else just to hang out and breed and throw a party and
[10:09.560 --> 10:14.040]  create large populations. Before you even know it, they move right up to your plants.
[10:14.040 --> 10:16.640]  You've got a huge spider mite infestation.
[10:16.640 --> 10:21.440]  So the first mistake is just generally messy grow rooms. Clean up all those leaves. Clean
[10:21.440 --> 10:25.120]  up all that extra shit that's in the grow. We don't need leaves on the floor. All that
[10:25.120 --> 10:30.080]  takes is a broom. You can sweep a large grow room in just very few minutes. When you get
[10:30.080 --> 10:34.080]  done with whatever job you're doing, you've got a couple of extra minutes before lunch.
[10:34.080 --> 10:37.240]  Don't just dick around and lean against the wall and hope nobody notices that you're not
[10:37.240 --> 10:42.080]  doing shit for five minutes. Take some initiative and just go sweep up one of those piles that
[10:42.080 --> 10:45.880]  are in a grow room. That will help you out in the future. That will help you prevent
[10:45.880 --> 10:50.960]  bug problems. That is going to make the grow look better. Being in a grow that looks better
[10:50.960 --> 10:55.640]  will increase morale. It will make people care more. So overall, it will increase the
[10:55.640 --> 11:00.400]  performance of your team and make the grow better. So clean up all the crap on the floor.
[11:00.400 --> 11:04.760]  Clean up all of the stuff on the tables. You don't need leaves. You don't need old rubber
[11:04.760 --> 11:08.760]  gloves. You don't need scissors. You don't need spray bottles. You don't need measuring
[11:08.760 --> 11:12.800]  containers. You don't need random shit in the grow room. All of those things have a
[11:12.800 --> 11:17.000]  home. Put them in their home. Most of them belong in the trash. Make some effort. Take
[11:17.000 --> 11:18.360]  out the trash.
[11:18.680 --> 11:23.800]  Another thing that goes along with the generally messy grow environment is a disorganized work
[11:23.800 --> 11:29.760]  area. If you're one of those chaotic, messy growers that has shit everywhere in your work
[11:29.760 --> 11:32.680]  area, you've got a measuring cup over here, you've got a cup over here, you've got a bottle
[11:32.680 --> 11:35.920]  over here that's open, you've got another bottle over here open, you've written a half
[11:35.920 --> 11:39.180]  a note about what you're doing, your phone's open playing a podcast, you're not paying
[11:39.180 --> 11:42.700]  attention to shit. If you're one of those chaotic guys that's got your scissors over
[11:42.700 --> 11:47.520]  in that room, your notebook's on that table, your pH pen is way over there, you can speed
[11:47.520 --> 11:52.880]  up your day and become way more productive by simply organizing and cleaning up your
[11:52.880 --> 11:59.040]  workspace. Not having to look for shit every time you need it will save you countless minutes,
[11:59.040 --> 12:02.080]  which will add up to countless hours.
[12:02.080 --> 12:07.320]  Some of my consulting clients get really surprised that one of the first requests I make of their
[12:07.320 --> 12:13.360]  staff is to take half a day to just clean the entire facility. Stop what you're doing.
[12:13.360 --> 12:17.480]  Are all the plants alive? Will they last through the end of the day? If the plants are cool,
[12:17.480 --> 12:21.520]  we're going to put them on hold for the day and we're going to clean the entire facility
[12:21.520 --> 12:26.560]  from top to bottom. We start off by cleaning every single grow room. We get all the trash,
[12:26.560 --> 12:30.940]  all of the debris, all of the unnecessary shit comes out of the grow. Then we clean
[12:30.940 --> 12:35.760]  up the entire facility. Then we clean the work area. Then we clean up the storage area.
[12:35.760 --> 12:41.120]  We make designated spaces for all of the gear. That way, the next time when you're working
[12:41.120 --> 12:45.120]  and you spill something and another guy wants to go get the mop, he doesn't have to run
[12:45.120 --> 12:48.940]  to four different places to see where you left the mop. It is over there in the fucking
[12:48.940 --> 12:53.760]  mop spot where it goes. It will save you so much time. The scissors, you need scissors.
[12:53.760 --> 12:58.080]  Oh, they're over there where the scissors go. It will save you so much time. So one
[12:58.080 --> 13:02.480]  of the first things that I do is I ask the staff to clean everything up. It's just like
[13:02.480 --> 13:06.680]  taking over a new kitchen. If I took over a kitchen, I would make the staff take a day
[13:06.680 --> 13:11.920]  to clean that kitchen. And yes, I do help. I do participate. Tie up the dreadlocks, put
[13:11.920 --> 13:16.080]  on some gloves, put on a shitty grubby t-shirt and get in there and help those boys clean
[13:16.080 --> 13:19.960]  the shit out. That is part of my job. They're not going to do shit that they don't see me
[13:19.960 --> 13:24.600]  do. So I do participate. I do help. I try to keep the team moving. I try to have a good
[13:24.600 --> 13:29.200]  time. I get a little rowdy. I get a little silly. It's a lot of fun, but stay motivated,
[13:29.200 --> 13:34.040]  stay passionate and make sure that your grow space is clean and organized.
[13:34.040 --> 13:38.760]  Everybody and every grow space has that one chore that everybody has been avoiding. Now
[13:38.760 --> 13:43.480]  is the time to do that stupid shit. Just take a minute, go clean it up. You'll feel
[13:43.480 --> 13:47.160]  so much better when it's cleaned. You'll feel better just by looking at it. A little bit
[13:47.160 --> 13:52.200]  of stress will be relieved. Then when management comes, they saw that mess the last couple
[13:52.200 --> 13:55.160]  times they were there. They saw that little corner where you're just throwing all the
[13:55.160 --> 13:59.680]  shit and it's making a big mess and it's all nasty looking. Management sees that. They
[13:59.680 --> 14:03.360]  haven't said anything about it yet, but they're taking a note and they saw it last time. They
[14:03.360 --> 14:06.820]  saw it the time before that. And if that shit's there the third time, that's when they'll
[14:06.820 --> 14:12.580]  say something. So it's up to you to take initiative and clean that shit up. That goes
[14:12.580 --> 14:16.140]  for everything in your grow, organize your space, get it together. It's going to save
[14:16.140 --> 14:19.540]  you a lot of time and you'll be more productive. I think I've been going on about that for
[14:19.540 --> 14:21.860]  long enough. Let's move forward.
[14:21.860 --> 14:28.780]  Another common mistake I see is very poor planning and communication. I say, hey, how
[14:28.780 --> 14:34.020]  many days into flower is room A? And all the grow techs go, I don't know. I don't know.
[14:34.020 --> 14:38.700]  You'll have to ask, go ask Jeff. He knows. Everybody should know how far into flower
[14:38.700 --> 14:41.940]  you are because it should be written on a calendar somewhere. It's either at the little
[14:41.940 --> 14:46.380]  main mixing area at the central location, or you've got a calendar on the outside of
[14:46.380 --> 14:51.620]  each grow room that says we put this room into flower on this day. This grow room is
[14:51.620 --> 14:57.540]  going to need these things this week, these things this week. Make a calendar, make a
[14:57.540 --> 15:01.100]  chart, have a plan, write some shit down.
[15:01.100 --> 15:04.220]  I was at a grow recently and I said, hey, when did you put these into flower? Because
[15:04.220 --> 15:07.700]  they kind of look like shit. And everybody said, oh, two weeks ago. I thought it was
[15:07.700 --> 15:12.140]  three weeks ago. I thought it was about 22 days ago. Nobody had any idea when those plants
[15:12.140 --> 15:15.740]  went into flower. We don't know what to feed them. We don't know when to harvest them because
[15:15.740 --> 15:20.060]  nobody wrote any shit down. I can tell by looking when they will be ready, it'd be more
[15:20.060 --> 15:25.220]  ideal if we could know when they fucking went into flower. Write that shit down. It is really
[15:25.220 --> 15:31.860]  easy just to say on January 1st, I put room A into flower. Write that down. Then everybody
[15:31.860 --> 15:37.420]  in the facility knows on January 1st, room A went into flower. So communicate with each
[15:37.420 --> 15:42.160]  other, have some notes, have some sort of communication hub. If it's not on an application
[15:42.160 --> 15:46.980]  in your phone, use a pen and paper, write notes at a central location, or everybody
[15:46.980 --> 15:50.740]  that works in that facility needs to check on that the first thing in the morning when
[15:50.740 --> 15:55.300]  they get there. I like to have a giant dry erase board. And on that dry erase board,
[15:55.300 --> 15:59.260]  I will make a plan for the day and a plan for the week. And most of the time, I will
[15:59.260 --> 16:04.220]  have a solid plan for the entire flowering phase of each flowering room. That is all
[16:04.220 --> 16:09.420]  visible for all employees to see. That way we all know what's going on. Then when we
[16:09.420 --> 16:13.660]  start a shift, everybody walks to that board and they look at it and they say, oh, today
[16:13.660 --> 16:18.860]  we need to defoliate room A. We need to apply a pesticide application to the bedroom. We
[16:18.860 --> 16:23.020]  need to make sure to do this and whatever else to room C. And there's a solid list written
[16:23.020 --> 16:29.340]  out on the board. They know what to do today. I will also learn what tasks specific employees
[16:29.340 --> 16:34.520]  are very good at and which tasks specific employees do not like to do. And I will do
[16:34.520 --> 16:39.860]  my best to assign tasks to the correct employee. If you got a guy who was six foot five, you
[16:39.860 --> 16:43.380]  might want him putting up trellis. If you got a guy who's five foot two, you might want
[16:43.380 --> 16:47.900]  him taking the bottoms off the plants. Learn to utilize people's skills. I see a lot of
[16:47.900 --> 16:53.500]  grow rooms. I see a lot of grow facilities with no plan, no rhyme or reason, no fucking
[16:53.500 --> 16:58.620]  goal, no communication, and it's not going to work. You are a team. You are all there
[16:58.620 --> 17:04.700]  with the same goal. You need to have the same map so you can all reach the same destination.
[17:04.700 --> 17:10.300]  So get a plan, get a schedule, get some communication going, have a spot in your grow. If it's just
[17:10.300 --> 17:14.380]  you, you can do all this stuff also. You need a plan. You need a schedule. You need some
[17:14.380 --> 17:18.580]  notes. If you're running a large facility, get your team together. Get everybody on the
[17:18.580 --> 17:23.060]  same page. Get everybody in line for the same goal. Let everybody know where you're going
[17:23.060 --> 17:26.980]  to turn left, where you're going to turn right, and you can all get there together. Hopefully,
[17:26.980 --> 17:29.820]  you can all get a bonus at the end of the harvest.
[17:29.820 --> 17:33.700]  So those are some simple things we can all work on to improve, to correct some mistakes
[17:33.700 --> 17:38.260]  in the grow. Let's work on more actual physical things that I see people doing wrong in a
[17:38.260 --> 17:45.380]  grow environment. In a lot of facilities, I see plants pressed too tightly together.
[17:45.380 --> 17:49.020]  A lot of people are just trying to crush plants together. They don't have room to grow. They
[17:49.020 --> 17:54.340]  don't have room for proper transpiration and respiration, and they're struggling. Instead
[17:54.340 --> 17:58.700]  of growing out and branching and getting strong and robust, your plants are growing straight
[17:58.700 --> 18:02.920]  up because they're angry. They're too snuggled in. They don't want to be touching each other.
[18:02.920 --> 18:06.620]  They want to grow. Imagine if I put you on the bus or on the subway. I don't know where
[18:06.620 --> 18:10.500]  you're from. Maybe I put you in a restaurant that's got way too many damn people in it,
[18:10.500 --> 18:14.280]  and it is super crowded. When you can spread your arms out, you're comfortable about life.
[18:14.280 --> 18:15.280]  You feel pretty good.
[18:15.280 --> 18:18.340]  When people get close to you, where you got to keep your arms in, you're like, yeah, I
[18:18.340 --> 18:21.780]  can't spread my arms out. As soon as people start rubbing you elbow to elbow or shoulder
[18:21.780 --> 18:25.180]  to shoulder, you get like, who the fuck are all these people and where they come from?
[18:25.180 --> 18:30.540]  The plants feel the same way. They want to be able to reach out. Maybe if they kind of
[18:30.540 --> 18:33.620]  rustle the leaves of the other ones, that's cool, but they don't want to be resting on
[18:33.620 --> 18:37.540]  each other. You never want two leaves laying on top of each other. That's going to create
[18:37.540 --> 18:41.380]  a problem between those two leaves. You don't really want plants rubbing up against each
[18:41.380 --> 18:43.780]  other. Give them some space.
[18:43.780 --> 18:48.400]  Now I see this in bedrooms and I see this in flowering rooms. Let's give the plants
[18:48.400 --> 18:52.900]  some breathing room. This will give us a few advantages. First off, you're going to get
[18:52.900 --> 18:57.100]  breathing room. The plants will grow more productively. They'll be able to transpire
[18:57.100 --> 19:02.940]  and respire more appropriately. That is what we need. Also, by spreading out the plants,
[19:02.940 --> 19:07.600]  we can get them more wind from our fans, which will make them a little stronger and
[19:07.600 --> 19:13.860]  a little more robust. Also, by spreading out our plants, we can apply pesticide applications
[19:13.860 --> 19:17.820]  more appropriately. If the plants are all crushed together and crowded in, how are you
[19:17.820 --> 19:22.940]  going to coat every surface of that plant with a pesticide applicator if there are leaves
[19:22.940 --> 19:27.840]  touching, if you've got too much shit pressed together? It is much easier to appropriately
[19:27.840 --> 19:33.200]  and properly apply a pesticide to plants that are not completely crowded in.
[19:33.200 --> 19:38.400]  By spreading our plants out a little bit, we are also going to improve our overall VPD
[19:38.400 --> 19:42.760]  throughout the room. When our plants are too close together, we do create microclimates.
[19:42.760 --> 19:47.360]  There are little pockets of humidity, little pockets of heat, little pockets of dry. We've
[19:47.360 --> 19:51.680]  got random, different microclimates throughout the grow environment, and that is not what
[19:51.680 --> 19:56.520]  we want. Our goal is consistency. So by moving the plants apart a little bit, we allow for
[19:56.520 --> 20:03.240]  more airflow, which allows for a more appropriate VPD, which eliminates the opportunity for
[20:03.240 --> 20:04.880]  a microclimate.
[20:04.880 --> 20:10.160]  Now another thing that I often see is that people let their plants grow way too close
[20:10.160 --> 20:15.840]  to the big commercial-grade grow lights. If you allow your plants to grow too closely
[20:15.840 --> 20:19.720]  to those high-powered grow lights, you will burn the tips of your plants. You will bleach
[20:19.720 --> 20:24.720]  the tips of your buds. You will start burning the trichomes. Those plants will slow in growth.
[20:24.720 --> 20:29.640]  All of the leaves will start curling up. You will piss off those plants. The main mistake
[20:29.640 --> 20:35.040]  that causes this problem is poor planning. Somebody did not make an appropriate grow
[20:35.040 --> 20:39.520]  room schedule. The plants were allowed to veg for too long. They got too tall before
[20:39.520 --> 20:42.960]  they were flipped into flower, and now you were dealing with plants that are way too
[20:42.960 --> 20:45.440]  tall and they're trying to grow into the light.
[20:45.440 --> 20:47.960]  What are you going to do? You're just going to let them grow? You're going to try to trellis
[20:47.960 --> 20:50.480]  them down? You're going to bend them? You're going to pop them? Are they just going to
[20:50.480 --> 20:54.440]  grow into the lights and get too tall? You've got like four or five weeks left to go to
[20:54.440 --> 20:59.820]  figure that out. Good luck. That shit sucks to deal with. So make sure you have a schedule.
[20:59.820 --> 21:03.840]  Make sure you know how tall your plants are going to get and do your best to flower those
[21:03.840 --> 21:07.280]  plants before they grow up into the grow lights.
[21:07.280 --> 21:12.240]  Now on the opposite side of that too close together coin, we've got the growers. They
[21:12.240 --> 21:18.920]  keep their plants way too far apart. In a commercial grow environment, every inch of
[21:18.920 --> 21:24.760]  grow space is valuable. That is all valuable real estate. So we need to find the very fine
[21:24.760 --> 21:30.180]  line, that perfect balance between not crushing the plants together, but also not having them
[21:30.180 --> 21:32.680]  so far apart that you're wasting space.
[21:32.680 --> 21:36.080]  We're not trying to grow floor. We're not trying to grow table. We don't need the light
[21:36.080 --> 21:39.980]  shining down on our hydro table. We don't need the light shining down onto the floor.
[21:39.980 --> 21:44.800]  We want all of our light hitting leaves. So we do need to find that balance. How close
[21:44.800 --> 21:48.720]  together do we put them? How far apart do we put them? That is a very good question.
[21:48.720 --> 21:52.720]  We want them to maybe rustle against each other, but we don't want them arresting on
[21:52.720 --> 21:54.000]  each other.
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.480]  Here's something to think about. In a commercial grow environment, space is very valuable.
[21:58.480 --> 22:03.320]  Every inch of grow space is valuable real estate. If you've got a long row of plants
[22:03.320 --> 22:08.560]  and you've got too much space between those plants, do you think you could possibly move
[22:08.560 --> 22:14.600]  each plant down one to two inches closer together and maybe fit one more plant at the end of
[22:14.600 --> 22:19.800]  that row so that you can get one more plant worth of productivity? Is that an option?
[22:19.800 --> 22:24.720]  There is a fine line between squeezing those plants in, it will just slow you down, or
[22:24.720 --> 22:28.960]  you can add that extra plant to properly fill all of your space. So don't squeeze them in
[22:28.960 --> 22:33.800]  too closely and also don't leave a lot of empty space. If your lights are shining down
[22:33.800 --> 22:37.560]  between your plants and you put your hand down at the bottom of the canopy near the
[22:37.560 --> 22:41.880]  pots, if you get light hitting your hand, your plants are too far apart or your canopy
[22:41.880 --> 22:45.080]  is too sparse, you need to fill in that space.
[22:45.080 --> 22:50.520]  A lot of times this happens when a new grower is trying to run a trellis system for the
[22:50.520 --> 22:55.480]  first time. They don't understand how to properly spread those plants out and fill in that trellis
[22:55.480 --> 22:59.960]  to get that big fat canopy going. So if you're packing in a room, if you're about to put
[22:59.960 --> 23:04.240]  up a trellis and try to get all those branches in that trellis, think about filling that
[23:04.240 --> 23:09.080]  space the best you can. Think about it this way. We've got the light coming from above,
[23:09.080 --> 23:13.400]  we don't want to see any light on the table or the floor. We want all of that light to
[23:13.400 --> 23:18.960]  be gathered by leaves. At the same time, we need to defoliate enough to where we don't
[23:18.960 --> 23:23.000]  block all of the light to where the lower of the plant can't get enough light to be
[23:23.000 --> 23:27.600]  active. There's a fine line, a fine balance to find in that area. We need to keep the
[23:27.600 --> 23:31.400]  plants close together. We need to keep them far enough apart. We need to keep enough light
[23:31.400 --> 23:36.120]  shining deep enough into the canopy, but we don't want it hitting our table or our floor.
[23:36.520 --> 23:41.800]  You do need to find that balance when spacing your plants. Don't ever think that a plant is
[23:41.800 --> 23:46.360]  in a permanent position until you have worked it into a trellis. If that plant doesn't have
[23:46.360 --> 23:49.960]  a net around it or some of the sticks aren't going through some sort of a net that are
[23:49.960 --> 23:55.240]  attaching it to another plant, that plant is probably mobile. Don't be afraid to start off
[23:55.240 --> 24:00.120]  with the plants kind of close together. As they grow, spread them out. As they continue to grow,
[24:00.120 --> 24:03.880]  spread them out. If you see them touching, if you see them getting too crowded in,
[24:03.880 --> 24:07.880]  it's time to kind of do a little bit of pruning, maybe manicure out some of the messy parts,
[24:07.880 --> 24:11.880]  but then you need to spread them out so they can grow out. They don't want to go straight up.
[24:11.880 --> 24:17.640]  They're only doing that because you've got them too close together. Now, another super common
[24:17.640 --> 24:22.680]  mistake that I see made in commercial grow environments and in personal grows is a lack
[24:22.680 --> 24:28.040]  of bud supports. People don't want to use sticks. People don't use tomato cages. People don't use
[24:28.040 --> 24:32.680]  trellising. They want to wait until the very last minute when that fucking branch is flopping over
[24:32.680 --> 24:36.680]  and ready to break. Get in there and put some sticks in your plants. Get in there and put a
[24:36.680 --> 24:42.520]  tomato cage around your plants. Use some zip ties, use a twist tie or use a garden tie is what they
[24:42.520 --> 24:47.400]  call them, and tie those big heavy branches to your tomato cage. Tie those big heavy branches
[24:47.400 --> 24:52.200]  to some sort of a support stick. Do it before everything starts falling over and making a
[24:52.200 --> 24:58.280]  giant mess. It is so much easier to get in that grow space and adjust the sticks and all the
[24:58.360 --> 25:03.240]  giant buds around week three or four than it is to do it around week five and six when they've
[25:03.240 --> 25:07.400]  already gotten giant and sticky and they're starting to topple over. Get in there and do
[25:07.400 --> 25:13.000]  that shit early. Ideally, in a commercial environment, you would set up long rows and
[25:13.000 --> 25:16.520]  you would just set up a trellis system so you don't have to put a thousand stakes in all of
[25:16.520 --> 25:22.440]  your pots. It is much easier to run a trellis system. Get some sort of supports in your plants
[25:22.440 --> 25:27.240]  early. Don't wait until they're falling over. It is hard. It's a pain in the ass. It takes much more
[25:27.240 --> 25:32.040]  manpower. It takes much more effort and you're probably fucking up a bunch of buds trying to
[25:32.040 --> 25:37.640]  lift them back up. So get some supports in your plants early is another thing people seem to miss.
[25:38.360 --> 25:44.840]  Also, I would highly suggest getting your plants off the floor if that is an option. Most grow
[25:44.840 --> 25:50.920]  facilities and basements and wherever most people are growing quite often have concrete floors. Most
[25:50.920 --> 25:54.760]  of the floors are treated with something in a commercial environment, but still that concrete
[25:54.760 --> 26:02.040]  floor is going to get very cold during your night cycle. The concrete stays cold. Here in Colorado,
[26:02.040 --> 26:07.880]  it gets fucking cold in the winter. We will have negative temperatures in the middle of winter. We
[26:07.880 --> 26:13.080]  will have snow stacked up three feet outside of our facility indoors. It will be okay warm because
[26:13.080 --> 26:18.360]  of the grow lights and all the equipment, but that floor gets really cold. Imagine if you got out of
[26:18.360 --> 26:22.360]  bed first thing in the morning, you don't have any slippers, you don't have any socks, and I just
[26:22.360 --> 26:27.880]  push your cold ass feet right onto that outside cold concrete. That's what your plants are sleeping
[26:27.880 --> 26:32.440]  on. That's what your plants are living on constantly if you've got them on a cold floor.
[26:33.080 --> 26:37.640]  Then you're going to water them. Now they are on that cold ass floor filled with water.
[26:37.640 --> 26:43.000]  That's like dipping your toes or your nuts in Arctic freeze water. Don't do that to your plants.
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.640]  Get them up off the ground if that is an option. I understand some of you have to work with what
[26:47.640 --> 26:52.120]  you've got. If you can just get them off the ground, put it on a cinder block. Quite commonly,
[26:52.440 --> 26:56.680]  people take another pot, flip it upside down, put the pot right on top of that so it's just
[26:57.240 --> 27:02.040]  off the ground. All we're trying to do is create space between that cold floor and our plants so
[27:02.040 --> 27:06.440]  that we can get our balls and our feet up off that freezing cold floor. That will really make the
[27:06.440 --> 27:11.240]  plants more productive. That'll make nutrient uptake happen more easily. That will make pH
[27:11.240 --> 27:16.760]  fluctuation stop, and it will overall improve the quality and harvest weight of your finished
[27:16.760 --> 27:22.040]  product. Get your plants up off the floor and you will see improvements. I've got one last note to
[27:22.040 --> 27:25.880]  talk about common mistakes that I see in a commercial grow room environment. I was going
[27:25.880 --> 27:30.920]  to save this for a complete episode, but I think I can cover it here in a quick rant. One of the
[27:30.920 --> 27:37.240]  things I see people making huge mistakes with in a commercial grow environment is what I call the
[27:37.240 --> 27:43.000]  basement grower mentality. Too many people have gotten into the commercial cannabis game thinking
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.320]  that they can take the ideas and technology that they have learned in their basement and just
[27:47.320 --> 27:54.040]  multiply it and it will work on a commercial scale. In theory, most of your math should work,
[27:54.040 --> 27:58.440]  but it is not that simple. There are so many more things to think about when it comes to
[27:58.440 --> 28:03.880]  commercial cultivation. So when you work in a commercial cultivation environment, it is time
[28:03.880 --> 28:09.320]  to shift from a basement grower, from a hobby grower, from a home grower mindset, and you need
[28:09.320 --> 28:15.160]  to focus on being a commercial scale cannabis cultivator. I don't care if that's medical or
[28:15.160 --> 28:21.480]  recreational, you need to shift gears. To be an efficient and effective commercial grower, you must
[28:21.480 --> 28:26.600]  shift your brain to think in a commercial productivity type of a mindset. The home
[28:26.600 --> 28:32.920]  grower basement will not survive in the commercial world. When you are working in a commercial
[28:32.920 --> 28:38.920]  cultivation facility, every dollar, every hour, every minute counts. Everything matters. We have
[28:38.920 --> 28:44.840]  a lot more freedom and a lot more leeway in our personal productivity grows, so you need to lose
[28:44.840 --> 28:50.120]  those habits when you come to a commercial cultivation facility. I was in a semi-large
[28:50.120 --> 28:55.320]  facility recently with an obviously new owner and I was asking him some of his plans. He told me
[28:55.320 --> 28:59.640]  where he was going and then he said, eventually, I want to pop a bunch of these seeds and maybe find
[28:59.640 --> 29:05.560]  a few phenotypes out of this and run that. I said, why do you want to do that? He said, oh,
[29:05.560 --> 29:09.880]  I don't know, just to add something new or play around with some seeds and see what we can get.
[29:09.880 --> 29:15.480]  I had to stop him. I had to say, sir, you just said, play around and see what we can get.
[29:15.480 --> 29:20.520]  At this point in time, you are in debt. You just took over a commercial facility that is in the
[29:20.520 --> 29:25.240]  red and you were talking about playing around with a pheno hunt to see what you can get.
[29:25.240 --> 29:29.880]  When this new owner took over this facility, it was already loaded with elite cuts.
[29:29.880 --> 29:35.240]  This facility has all of the genetics it needs and this guy is already thinking about popping
[29:35.240 --> 29:40.920]  new seeds to start a pheno hunt in one of his flowering rooms. That is not productive for a
[29:40.920 --> 29:46.840]  business that is already in the red. Instead of running that grow room full of seedlings that we
[29:46.840 --> 29:52.120]  don't know what they are going to do, that man needs to find his highest producing cultivar,
[29:52.120 --> 29:58.760]  his best selling cultivar and pack that entire room with that plant and produce as much of that
[29:58.760 --> 30:04.120]  as possible so that he can get his business out of the red. Now, I kind of had to grab him and say,
[30:04.120 --> 30:08.760]  bro, you're thinking like a basement grower quit doing that stupid shit. Let's focus our mind on a
[30:08.760 --> 30:14.040]  commercial cultivation facility. Eventually, he snapped out of it and he's not going to do a silly
[30:14.040 --> 30:20.120]  pheno hunt, but I had to almost slap this man to get him to think straight. Focus your mind more
[30:20.120 --> 30:24.840]  appropriately. Keep your eye on the prize. Eliminate any bullshit. Take out anything in
[30:24.840 --> 30:28.840]  your process that slows you down. Take out anything you're doing that is just novel.
[30:28.840 --> 30:32.440]  Take out anything that you do because your uncle Larry said that it was a good idea
[30:32.440 --> 30:37.240]  back in the 80s. Unless all of those weird tricks that you're doing actually show some
[30:37.240 --> 30:43.000]  sort of a visible payoff, cut that useless, habitual, silly shit out of your routine
[30:43.000 --> 30:47.800]  and focus on being a top-notch, advanced, commercial cannabis cultivator.
[30:47.800 --> 30:51.000]  Robert Leonard All right, podcast world, my voice is starting to get super dry,
[30:51.000 --> 30:54.840]  so I'm going to wrap up this podcast. I do have more things to talk about when it comes to
[30:54.840 --> 30:59.560]  making mistakes in a grow room. The first thing to do when it comes to making a mistake in the
[30:59.560 --> 31:04.680]  grow room is to acknowledge that you fucked up. Don't be afraid to admit it and then learn from
[31:04.680 --> 31:09.880]  that. Learn how to not make that mistake again and learn how to move forward and correct your mistake.
[31:09.880 --> 31:14.280]  That is what it's all about. That is how you become the best grower and the best person that
[31:14.280 --> 31:18.200]  you can possibly be. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for listening to this episode of the
