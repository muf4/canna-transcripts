[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[00:16.000 --> 00:21.000]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious shit.
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.500]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[00:22.500 --> 00:24.000]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.500]  What we gonna do right here is go back.
[00:25.500 --> 00:26.500]  Before you going back.
[00:26.500 --> 00:27.500]  Way back.
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  As we go a little something like this.
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.000]  Hit it!
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.500]  Anyways, any promotions or any contests, all of that stuff has expired.
[00:48.500 --> 00:54.000]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways or contests that are valid in these old episodes.
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  I want to thank you guys for listening and with no further ado, here's a block of old
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.500]  episodes of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:02.000 --> 01:18.520]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[01:18.520 --> 01:21.520]  It's time for episode number 133 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:21.520 --> 01:25.520]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:25.520 --> 01:29.020]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a news smoker
[01:29.020 --> 01:33.020]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[01:33.020 --> 01:37.020]  about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:37.020 --> 01:39.520]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:39.520 --> 01:41.020]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:41.020 --> 01:44.520]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[01:44.520 --> 01:47.020]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:47.020 --> 01:51.020]  Big shouts to Kat, Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:51.020 --> 01:54.020]  You guys don't forget to catch the Mystic Roots band on tour this spring.
[01:54.020 --> 01:55.020]  They're coming to Colorado.
[01:55.020 --> 01:56.020]  You know I'll be there.
[01:56.020 --> 01:57.020]  Wow, that music was loud.
[01:57.020 --> 01:58.020]  Holy shit.
[01:58.020 --> 01:59.520]  That's why it sounds like echoey in my head.
[01:59.520 --> 02:02.520]  I apologize if it's echoing in your head.
[02:02.520 --> 02:04.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast.
[02:04.020 --> 02:05.020]  I'm dabbing the fuck out.
[02:05.020 --> 02:07.020]  I'm hitting my new rig from Elevate Glass.
[02:07.020 --> 02:08.020]  Shout out to my friends at Elevate.
[02:08.020 --> 02:12.520]  I've got a dope new recycler, got a dope new banger, got a dope new dabber.
[02:12.520 --> 02:14.020]  Shout out to all my friends over there.
[02:14.020 --> 02:18.020]  Make sure you support Elevate Glass in Colorado Springs.
[02:18.020 --> 02:21.520]  Sitting across from me, you guys, is the lovely, the traveling stoner, my friend, Miss Lindsay.
[02:21.520 --> 02:22.520]  How you doing today, honey?
[02:22.520 --> 02:23.020]  Pretty good.
[02:23.020 --> 02:26.520]  Sorry, I introduced you right as you were about to take a drink, but it was the rhythm.
[02:26.520 --> 02:27.520]  It was just happening.
[02:27.520 --> 02:28.520]  Just feeling the flow.
[02:28.520 --> 02:29.020]  All right.
[02:29.020 --> 02:30.520]  Sitting to my left here is our good friend, White Mike.
[02:30.520 --> 02:31.520]  How you doing, buddy?
[02:31.520 --> 02:32.020]  Doing well, man.
[02:32.020 --> 02:33.020]  What's up with you?
[02:33.020 --> 02:36.020]  I'm hanging out, taking some dabs, doing a podcast, loving life.
[02:36.020 --> 02:36.520]  Right.
[02:36.520 --> 02:38.020]  Delicious, delicious hash.
[02:38.020 --> 02:39.520]  Trying to get the echo out of this show.
[02:39.520 --> 02:40.520]  I think I just fixed the echo.
[02:40.520 --> 02:41.520]  Sorry about the echo there, guys.
[02:41.520 --> 02:42.520]  I realized it was happening.
[02:42.520 --> 02:44.520]  I just could not figure out where the fuck it was coming from.
[02:44.520 --> 02:46.520]  The echo's been solved.
[02:46.520 --> 02:47.520]  All right.
[02:47.520 --> 02:48.020]  Let's see.
[02:48.020 --> 02:49.020]  What do we talk about first?
[02:49.020 --> 02:54.020]  Oh, I'm proud to announce that this podcast is now available on tokeradio.com.
[02:54.020 --> 02:57.520]  I think the show airs on Wednesdays at 1 p.m.
[02:57.520 --> 02:58.520]  Nice.
[02:58.520 --> 02:59.520]  Tokeradio.com.
[02:59.520 --> 03:00.520]  Make sure you check that out.
[03:00.520 --> 03:03.520]  Big shout out to Jay, Citizen Jay at Tokeradio.
[03:03.520 --> 03:06.520]  I should verify what time that airs.
[03:06.520 --> 03:08.520]  I'm mostly sure that's Wednesdays at 1 p.m.
[03:08.520 --> 03:11.020]  You never know how it goes.
[03:11.020 --> 03:12.520]  I'll verify that by the end of the show.
[03:12.520 --> 03:15.520]  When you guys are talking, I will check an email that I got from Jay, and we will make
[03:15.520 --> 03:16.520]  sure that I'm telling you the right time.
[03:16.520 --> 03:18.020]  We took a bunch of dabs.
[03:18.020 --> 03:19.520]  Did we shout out to Elevate?
[03:19.520 --> 03:20.520]  I'm pretty sure we did that.
[03:20.520 --> 03:21.520]  Yep.
[03:21.520 --> 03:22.520]  That happens.
[03:23.520 --> 03:24.520]  All right.
[03:24.520 --> 03:26.020]  Also, what else?
[03:26.020 --> 03:28.020]  Secret Sesh.
[03:28.020 --> 03:29.020]  Yes.
[03:29.020 --> 03:30.020]  Secret Sesh.
[03:30.020 --> 03:32.020]  Is it a secret if we talk about it here?
[03:32.020 --> 03:35.020]  I guess we just can't talk about the location, right?
[03:35.020 --> 03:36.020]  It's a secret.
[03:36.020 --> 03:38.520]  But Secret Sesh, we would like you to join us.
[03:38.520 --> 03:39.520]  Lindsay will be there.
[03:39.520 --> 03:40.520]  I will be there.
[03:40.520 --> 03:42.520]  Mike, you going to come to the Secret Sesh, bro?
[03:42.520 --> 03:43.520]  It's entirely possible.
[03:43.520 --> 03:45.020]  White Mike might make an appearance.
[03:45.020 --> 03:49.020]  He doesn't make it to a lot of cannabis events because he is busy at city council fighting
[03:49.020 --> 03:51.020]  for the rights of Pueblo cannabis.
[03:51.520 --> 03:53.520]  Or lately, I'm just home with the kid.
[03:53.520 --> 03:54.520]  Yeah, shout out to the kid.
[03:54.520 --> 03:58.020]  I know a lot of podcast listeners, you're going to have to deal with this one for a
[03:58.020 --> 03:58.520]  second.
[03:58.520 --> 03:59.520]  How's the kid, bro?
[03:59.520 --> 04:00.520]  He's doing good.
[04:00.520 --> 04:01.520]  Good.
[04:01.520 --> 04:03.020]  I just had another checkup today and all good.
[04:03.020 --> 04:04.020]  All right.
[04:04.020 --> 04:05.020]  There you go.
[04:05.020 --> 04:06.020]  Sorry.
[04:06.020 --> 04:07.020]  Sorry, listeners.
[04:07.020 --> 04:08.020]  Two seconds about the kid.
[04:08.020 --> 04:09.020]  I hope you guys could deal with that.
[04:09.020 --> 04:10.020]  Shout out to the little guy.
[04:10.020 --> 04:11.020]  Yeah.
[04:11.020 --> 04:12.020]  Yeah.
[04:12.020 --> 04:13.020]  Love for the kid.
[04:13.020 --> 04:14.020]  How's the wife, bro?
[04:14.020 --> 04:15.020]  No, I'm just kidding.
[04:15.020 --> 04:18.020]  Everything good at home?
[04:18.020 --> 04:19.020]  Yeah.
[04:19.020 --> 04:20.020]  Doing well.
[04:20.020 --> 04:25.020]  This just got fucking weird real quick.
[04:25.020 --> 04:26.020]  Secret sesh, you guys.
[04:26.020 --> 04:27.020]  May 19th.
[04:27.020 --> 04:28.020]  We hope you will be there.
[04:28.020 --> 04:29.020]  Make sure you check it out.
[04:29.020 --> 04:31.020]  Secret sesh underscore CO on Instagram.
[04:31.020 --> 04:36.020]  All of the information on how to get tickets, how to get VIP tickets, regular tickets, that's
[04:36.020 --> 04:37.020]  all there.
[04:37.020 --> 04:38.020]  Come party with us.
[04:38.020 --> 04:39.020]  Come take dabs with us.
[04:39.020 --> 04:40.020]  Come glob out.
[04:40.020 --> 04:45.020]  Some of the best shatter, some of the best live resin, some of the best wax, some of
[04:45.020 --> 04:46.020]  the best THC distillate.
[04:46.020 --> 04:47.020]  Not some of the best people.
[04:47.020 --> 04:48.020]  I'm just kidding.
[04:48.020 --> 04:49.020]  Some of the best people.
[04:49.020 --> 04:50.020]  I'm just kidding.
[04:50.020 --> 04:53.020]  Well, I did meet one dude there that I wish I would have never met.
[04:53.020 --> 04:54.020]  No, I'm just kidding.
[04:54.020 --> 04:55.020]  I'm just kidding.
[04:55.020 --> 04:56.020]  I just always wanted every party.
[04:56.020 --> 04:57.020]  I'm in with that part out.
[04:57.020 --> 04:58.020]  I don't even want to die.
[04:58.020 --> 05:03.020]  There are a lot of cameras and events in Colorado, and I don't want to go to a lot of them, but
[05:03.020 --> 05:04.020]  this one's high on my list.
[05:04.020 --> 05:05.020]  Nice.
[05:05.020 --> 05:06.020]  Yeah.
[05:06.020 --> 05:07.020]  The last one was really sweet.
[05:07.020 --> 05:08.020]  I got to hang out with you all night, actually, Jeff.
[05:08.020 --> 05:09.020]  Yeah, we had fun.
[05:09.020 --> 05:10.020]  It worked out.
[05:10.020 --> 05:11.020]  Yeah.
[05:11.020 --> 05:14.020]  You can retell the story that you told Mike about the dab I took.
[05:14.020 --> 05:15.020]  Oh, okay.
[05:16.020 --> 05:20.020]  Shout out to Mary's motivation on Instagram.
[05:20.020 --> 05:23.020]  Brent, I got to meet him at a secret session.
[05:23.020 --> 05:32.020]  He had some of this THC distillate, and Jeff is a wook and always takes such big dabs,
[05:32.020 --> 05:38.020]  and he took a nice chunk glob of this THC distillate, and you just watched his whole
[05:38.020 --> 05:40.020]  face change, and that was it.
[05:40.020 --> 05:42.020]  He was super stoned.
[05:42.020 --> 05:43.020]  I mean, don't get me wrong.
[05:43.020 --> 05:44.020]  Jeff was still dabbing.
[05:44.020 --> 05:45.020]  Jeff was still smoking.
[05:45.020 --> 05:46.020]  It was a sesh.
[05:46.020 --> 05:52.020]  He's not going to look like a wimp, but you could just see all over his face that that
[05:52.020 --> 05:57.020]  dab changed his level for the whole night, and that was it.
[05:57.020 --> 05:59.020]  I kind of remember that dab.
[05:59.020 --> 06:03.020]  I remember being like, yeah, give me a fatty glob, dude, because I love some distillate.
[06:03.020 --> 06:07.020]  You can pull the fattest, so we should kind of try to describe what distillate is.
[06:07.020 --> 06:13.020]  So they take CO2, and a hash maker will take CO2 hash, hash that's made with CO2.
[06:13.020 --> 06:15.020]  Oftentimes, it's kind of black and goopy.
[06:15.020 --> 06:19.020]  Sometimes, it comes out kind of gold, but then they do what I think is fractal distillation
[06:19.020 --> 06:23.020]  is what I think it's called, and it could be done with steam.
[06:23.020 --> 06:25.020]  It could be done ... I'm not sure how a lot of the companies do it.
[06:25.020 --> 06:29.020]  All the companies have their own proprietary method, but they pretty much distill this
[06:29.020 --> 06:35.020]  product, and they give you pure THC with terpenes put back in, or some of the companies actually
[06:35.020 --> 06:41.020]  put in terpenes that are purchased from other products, that are derived from other products,
[06:41.020 --> 06:45.020]  but what this guy had was just pure cannabis with cannabis terpenes in it, cannabis terpenoids,
[06:45.020 --> 06:47.020]  and so it's all pure.
[06:47.020 --> 06:48.020]  It's just super pure.
[06:48.020 --> 06:53.020]  It's THC and terps, and you can take the biggest freaking dabs, and you don't choke.
[06:53.020 --> 06:57.020]  My lungs felt like they got a little smoke in them.
[06:57.020 --> 07:01.020]  I was like, oh yeah, my lungs got some smoke, and I blew it out, and there was a cloud.
[07:01.020 --> 07:05.020]  I was like, yeah, I'm not going to cough, but I could definitely feel ... Yeah, you
[07:05.020 --> 07:07.020]  could feel the face go a little ...
[07:07.020 --> 07:09.020]  It bounced from white to red to white to red.
[07:09.020 --> 07:10.020]  Yeah, that's ...
[07:10.020 --> 07:11.020]  The usual, Jeff.
[07:11.020 --> 07:12.020]  I love those dabs.
[07:12.020 --> 07:17.020]  Yeah, that raw THC distillate was just out of this world.
[07:17.020 --> 07:22.020]  Actually, he gifted Chris and I that, and the added terpenes one, and Chris can't remember
[07:22.020 --> 07:26.020]  which terpene was added to it, and it was a good week.
[07:26.020 --> 07:28.020]  It was a really good week.
[07:28.020 --> 07:30.020]  Those morning dabs were special.
[07:30.020 --> 07:31.020]  Woo.
[07:31.020 --> 07:35.020]  Mike brought over some strawberry banana dabs.
[07:35.020 --> 07:37.020]  We're going to have to dab that in a minute.
[07:37.020 --> 07:38.020]  That sounds super interesting.
[07:38.020 --> 07:40.020]  Yep, some live resin I picked up the other day.
[07:40.020 --> 07:41.020]  Yeah, nice.
[07:41.020 --> 07:43.020]  Is that from the Place of Employment?
[07:43.020 --> 07:44.020]  Yeah, I picked that up at work.
[07:44.020 --> 07:46.020]  It's a Botanico product, though.
[07:46.020 --> 07:47.020]  Nice.
[07:47.020 --> 07:48.020]  Shout out to Botanico.
[07:48.020 --> 07:49.020]  Yeah, they make some tasty stuff.
[07:49.020 --> 07:51.020]  I like the new Turpex packaging.
[07:51.020 --> 07:52.020]  That's pretty rad.
[07:52.020 --> 07:53.020]  Yeah.
[07:53.020 --> 07:54.020]  Love their new packaging.
[07:54.020 --> 07:55.020]  Secret Sash, May 19th.
[07:55.020 --> 07:58.020]  I don't know if we finished that part up, but I take dabs at Secret Sash.
[07:58.020 --> 07:59.020]  I hope you come take dabs with us.
[07:59.020 --> 08:02.020]  All right, so we're going to talk about a couple of things here.
[08:02.020 --> 08:05.020]  Mike and I and Lindsey, Mike and I have lived here for a long ass time.
[08:05.020 --> 08:07.020]  We've seen this cannabis industry change.
[08:07.020 --> 08:10.020]  We thought all the raids and all the cannabis shit has gone away.
[08:10.020 --> 08:11.020]  Lindsey's been here for a while.
[08:11.020 --> 08:14.020]  She hasn't seen any cannabis trouble in the time that she's been here.
[08:14.020 --> 08:15.020]  Nope.
[08:15.020 --> 08:16.020]  And then in the past, how many weeks, Mike?
[08:16.020 --> 08:17.020]  Seven.
[08:17.020 --> 08:18.020]  Seven weeks?
[08:18.020 --> 08:19.020]  How many raids?
[08:19.020 --> 08:21.020]  18 now.
[08:21.020 --> 08:23.020]  18 raids in seven weeks in Pueblo County.
[08:23.020 --> 08:26.020]  And they're not like stores or licensed facilities or anything.
[08:26.020 --> 08:32.020]  They're private grows that are way over their legal plant count.
[08:32.020 --> 08:33.020]  Way over their legal plant count.
[08:33.020 --> 08:36.020]  I saw them pulling a whole bunch of plants out of one guy's garage on the
[08:36.020 --> 08:37.020]  news the other day.
[08:37.020 --> 08:40.020]  The number 18 only had like 50 plants,
[08:40.020 --> 08:45.020]  but a couple of them before that were in the several hundred or like 1200,
[08:45.020 --> 08:46.020]  1500.
[08:46.020 --> 08:49.020]  I read somewhere that a lot of these grows are connected.
[08:49.020 --> 08:53.020]  There was another set of raids up in spring.
[08:53.020 --> 08:54.020]  Another set of raids.
[08:54.020 --> 08:57.020]  This 18 doesn't count, that were all connected in like El Paso and Denver County.
[08:57.020 --> 09:02.020]  Our laws didn't change the black market anywhere else.
[09:03.020 --> 09:06.020]  And so there's still a bunch of black market growers that are sitting around
[09:06.020 --> 09:07.020]  all winter going,
[09:07.020 --> 09:11.020]  where's the place where I think I can hide and no one will notice me growing
[09:11.020 --> 09:12.020]  marijuana.
[09:12.020 --> 09:15.020]  And apparently like if you're sitting in Florida all winter thinking that the
[09:15.020 --> 09:16.020]  answer is Colorado,
[09:16.020 --> 09:19.020]  because there's a shitload of people from Florida getting busted growing a
[09:19.020 --> 09:20.020]  shitload of plants here.
[09:20.020 --> 09:21.020]  Yeah.
[09:21.020 --> 09:22.020]  Most of the raids happened to people.
[09:22.020 --> 09:23.020]  Yeah.
[09:23.020 --> 09:24.020]  They happen to be people.
[09:24.020 --> 09:25.020]  Yeah.
[09:25.020 --> 09:26.020]  So where are you from over there?
[09:26.020 --> 09:27.020]  Miss Lindsay,
[09:27.020 --> 09:28.020]  miss the traveling stoner.
[09:28.020 --> 09:29.020]  I was born in Jersey,
[09:29.020 --> 09:30.020]  so I guess I'll claim that today.
[09:30.020 --> 09:31.020]  I don't ever claim that.
[09:31.020 --> 09:33.020]  Like I never tell people I'm from Jersey.
[09:33.020 --> 09:35.020]  I will claim Florida over Jersey.
[09:35.020 --> 09:40.020]  I've made a couple of friends that are recent arrivals in Colorado,
[09:40.020 --> 09:42.020]  like over the last year and a half or so from Florida.
[09:42.020 --> 09:43.020]  And I've told all of them like,
[09:43.020 --> 09:44.020]  yo,
[09:44.020 --> 09:45.020]  if you're growing weed,
[09:45.020 --> 09:48.020]  make sure your plant count is spot the fuck on because it's only a matter of
[09:48.020 --> 09:50.020]  time before our sheriff knocks on your door and is like,
[09:50.020 --> 09:51.020]  I hear you're from Florida.
[09:51.020 --> 09:53.020]  Can I see your basement?
[09:53.020 --> 09:55.020]  Can I see your basement?
[09:55.020 --> 09:56.020]  Is it that easy?
[09:56.020 --> 09:57.020]  Can they just knock?
[09:57.020 --> 09:58.020]  Well,
[09:58.020 --> 09:59.020]  there's a couple of things that work here.
[10:00.020 --> 10:03.020]  Like all the bus are in the same area.
[10:03.020 --> 10:05.020]  And if you ask me,
[10:05.020 --> 10:07.020]  cause all the,
[10:07.020 --> 10:09.020]  the press stories all say the same thing.
[10:09.020 --> 10:11.020]  A citizen complaint was called in.
[10:11.020 --> 10:16.020]  The sheriffs went out to check confirmed the suspicion that there was
[10:16.020 --> 10:17.020]  marijuana being grown there,
[10:17.020 --> 10:18.020]  check the plant counts,
[10:18.020 --> 10:22.020]  found a shitload of plants and no paperwork and arrested the recent
[10:22.020 --> 10:24.020]  arrival from Florida.
[10:24.020 --> 10:28.020]  Like there's like 18 grows and like 15 of them match that exact layup.
[10:29.020 --> 10:32.020]  And so I think it's the anti-pop people that have that,
[10:32.020 --> 10:34.020]  that are working on that ballot initiative.
[10:34.020 --> 10:35.020]  Most of them live out in Pueblo West.
[10:35.020 --> 10:39.020]  I think they're just driving around looking at new house or looking at
[10:39.020 --> 10:42.020]  houses for vents and the stink of weed.
[10:42.020 --> 10:45.020]  And they're just calling on everything they find.
[10:45.020 --> 10:49.020]  They're not reporting on all the grows that are perfectly legal where they
[10:49.020 --> 10:51.020]  knock on the door and the dude's like,
[10:51.020 --> 10:52.020]  I totally grow marijuana here.
[10:52.020 --> 10:53.020]  It's a hundred percent legal.
[10:53.020 --> 10:57.020]  I have blank number of plants in X number of paperwork sheets.
[10:57.020 --> 11:00.020]  Here's everything to confirm what I'm legally allowed to have.
[11:00.020 --> 11:01.020]  Come take a look.
[11:01.020 --> 11:02.020]  Here's what's I've got.
[11:02.020 --> 11:05.020]  You can confirm it's all correct.
[11:05.020 --> 11:06.020]  Have a nice day.
[11:06.020 --> 11:07.020]  They just turn around and leave.
[11:07.020 --> 11:08.020]  Having a small grow.
[11:08.020 --> 11:09.020]  Isn't a big deal right now.
[11:09.020 --> 11:10.020]  No,
[11:10.020 --> 11:12.020]  having a legal grow isn't an issue at all.
[11:12.020 --> 11:14.020]  They're not messing with the businesses.
[11:14.020 --> 11:15.020]  They're not.
[11:15.020 --> 11:17.020]  Cause that happens in a lot of states.
[11:17.020 --> 11:21.020]  It's just the home grows that are way out of compliance with that law.
[11:21.020 --> 11:24.020]  Do you think they're using electricity bills to find?
[11:25.020 --> 11:26.020]  That's what I was just going to say.
[11:26.020 --> 11:27.020]  I was just like,
[11:27.020 --> 11:28.020]  yep.
[11:28.020 --> 11:29.020]  I was going to say they're looking at that.
[11:29.020 --> 11:31.020]  They have a lot of angles,
[11:31.020 --> 11:32.020]  but at the end of the day,
[11:32.020 --> 11:34.020]  what it comes down to is that if you come out here,
[11:34.020 --> 11:35.020]  please do it legally,
[11:35.020 --> 11:36.020]  get the paperwork.
[11:36.020 --> 11:37.020]  I've,
[11:37.020 --> 11:40.020]  I have listened to so many podcasts of you to stay here and say,
[11:40.020 --> 11:41.020]  do it the right way.
[11:41.020 --> 11:42.020]  Stop,
[11:42.020 --> 11:43.020]  you know,
[11:43.020 --> 11:44.020]  stop trying to,
[11:44.020 --> 11:46.020]  you're making our community look bad.
[11:46.020 --> 11:50.020]  You're making us look like we're trying to break the laws and trying to get
[11:50.020 --> 11:51.020]  away with this.
[11:51.020 --> 11:53.020]  None of us in the community are trying to,
[11:53.020 --> 11:56.020]  I have not started growing yet since I have come out here because my
[11:56.020 --> 11:58.020]  paperwork is not in order yet.
[11:58.020 --> 12:00.020]  I'd love to be growing.
[12:00.020 --> 12:01.020]  I'd love to have a whole,
[12:01.020 --> 12:02.020]  you know,
[12:02.020 --> 12:03.020]  two rooms going,
[12:03.020 --> 12:04.020]  but it's not going to happen.
[12:04.020 --> 12:05.020]  Right?
[12:05.020 --> 12:09.020]  Like I need to get my paperwork in line first and I can grow six legally as
[12:09.020 --> 12:11.020]  a Colorado resident.
[12:11.020 --> 12:12.020]  I can't be a hypocrite.
[12:12.020 --> 12:15.020]  I know there was a time where I was moving and shaking and doing shit that
[12:15.020 --> 12:17.020]  should not be spoken of on a podcast.
[12:18.020 --> 12:20.020]  But we've told some hypothetical stories of my past.
[12:20.020 --> 12:21.020]  So if you're,
[12:21.020 --> 12:23.020]  if you are hustling on the black market,
[12:23.020 --> 12:24.020]  doing your thing,
[12:24.020 --> 12:25.020]  we're not a hater.
[12:25.020 --> 12:26.020]  We're not mad at you.
[12:26.020 --> 12:27.020]  You got to do your thing,
[12:27.020 --> 12:28.020]  do what you got to do.
[12:28.020 --> 12:30.020]  But eventually there's going to come a time when you,
[12:30.020 --> 12:32.020]  when you got to start thinking about shifting to the legal market.
[12:32.020 --> 12:36.020]  There's a difference between making money to survive and being greedy and
[12:36.020 --> 12:40.020]  having these huge grows that these people are getting busted for.
[12:40.020 --> 12:41.020]  And that's the issue.
[12:41.020 --> 12:42.020]  It's,
[12:42.020 --> 12:45.020]  it's these huge commercial grows in houses for no reason.
[12:45.020 --> 12:48.020]  Like you're all going to go and sell that in another,
[12:48.020 --> 12:49.020]  you know,
[12:49.020 --> 12:50.020]  I mean,
[12:50.020 --> 12:52.020]  if you really think about it,
[12:52.020 --> 12:53.020]  it's just so stupid.
[12:53.020 --> 12:55.020]  Like this is why they were in the national parks 10 years ago.
[12:55.020 --> 12:56.020]  Um,
[12:56.020 --> 13:00.020]  and they hide anywhere they think they can hide.
[13:00.020 --> 13:01.020]  It's,
[13:01.020 --> 13:03.020]  and they're trying to hide in Colorado.
[13:03.020 --> 13:04.020]  They just,
[13:04.020 --> 13:07.020]  they don't realize how well publicized the rules are,
[13:07.020 --> 13:10.020]  have been here because they're not publicized anywhere else.
[13:10.020 --> 13:11.020]  Like New Mexico,
[13:11.020 --> 13:12.020]  Florida,
[13:12.020 --> 13:13.020]  Kansas,
[13:13.020 --> 13:14.020]  none of these places care about.
[13:14.020 --> 13:18.020]  What the zoning rules are for the shops or what the home grow rules are in
[13:18.020 --> 13:19.020]  each city and County.
[13:19.020 --> 13:21.020]  So none of that shit makes the paper.
[13:21.020 --> 13:24.020]  It just says weeds legal and they're allowed to grow their own house
[13:24.020 --> 13:25.020]  range.
[13:25.020 --> 13:26.020]  And so they think,
[13:26.020 --> 13:27.020]  Oh,
[13:27.020 --> 13:28.020]  I can move to Colorado.
[13:28.020 --> 13:29.020]  I can go to the grow store.
[13:29.020 --> 13:33.020]  I can throw down the 18 grand or whatever I've managed to save up on
[13:33.020 --> 13:34.020]  grow equipment,
[13:34.020 --> 13:35.020]  rent a house,
[13:35.020 --> 13:36.020]  um,
[13:36.020 --> 13:37.020]  pull a crop or two,
[13:37.020 --> 13:39.020]  drive it all back to Florida and bam,
[13:39.020 --> 13:40.020]  I've got 400 grand.
[13:40.020 --> 13:42.020]  And they just don't see it.
[13:43.020 --> 13:44.020]  How insane that plan is.
[13:44.020 --> 13:45.020]  Um,
[13:45.020 --> 13:47.020]  like the grow store is going to sell you all that shit.
[13:47.020 --> 13:48.020]  No problem.
[13:48.020 --> 13:49.020]  But the,
[13:49.020 --> 13:50.020]  when you plug it all in,
[13:50.020 --> 13:53.020]  you're going to have to have the power company come out by the time the
[13:53.020 --> 13:55.020]  power company's done upgrading you,
[13:55.020 --> 13:57.020]  all your neighbors want to know what the fuck you're doing.
[13:57.020 --> 13:59.020]  As soon as it smells like weed,
[13:59.020 --> 14:01.020]  which is going to be about what eight weeks later.
[14:01.020 --> 14:02.020]  Um,
[14:02.020 --> 14:04.020]  one of them is going to call the sheriff and go,
[14:04.020 --> 14:05.020]  would you knock on this box door?
[14:05.020 --> 14:06.020]  Yeah.
[14:06.020 --> 14:08.020]  He had some guy building some shit there.
[14:08.020 --> 14:09.020]  They did new electricity.
[14:09.020 --> 14:10.020]  Watch them carrying a bunch of shit.
[14:10.020 --> 14:11.020]  Now it reeks.
[14:11.020 --> 14:12.020]  I'm pretty sure he's got an illegal operation.
[14:12.020 --> 14:13.020]  Yeah.
[14:13.020 --> 14:15.020]  And this is all assuming you don't have a landlord that's going to be
[14:15.020 --> 14:17.020]  checking on everything and all of that jazz as well.
[14:17.020 --> 14:18.020]  A couple of these guys were like,
[14:18.020 --> 14:19.020]  just showed up,
[14:19.020 --> 14:20.020]  rented a house,
[14:20.020 --> 14:22.020]  went to bought some plyboard and started plyboarding over exterior
[14:22.020 --> 14:23.020]  windows.
[14:23.020 --> 14:24.020]  Um,
[14:24.020 --> 14:25.020]  like one dude had a pit bull chain to a window.
[14:25.020 --> 14:26.020]  Well,
[14:26.020 --> 14:28.020]  like these are idiots in the most extreme sense.
[14:28.020 --> 14:29.020]  Um,
[14:29.020 --> 14:31.020]  and then they're going to go to the grocery store and they're going to
[14:31.020 --> 14:32.020]  buy a house.
[14:32.020 --> 14:34.020]  And then they're going to go to the grocery store and they're going to
[14:34.020 --> 14:35.020]  buy a house.
[14:35.020 --> 14:36.020]  And then they're going to go to the grocery store and they're going to
[14:36.020 --> 14:37.020]  buy a house.
[14:37.020 --> 14:38.020]  Like that's the most extreme sense.
[14:38.020 --> 14:39.020]  Um,
[14:39.020 --> 14:40.020]  because I mean,
[14:40.020 --> 14:41.020]  if you think about it,
[14:41.020 --> 14:42.020]  you could move here,
[14:42.020 --> 14:43.020]  grow,
[14:43.020 --> 14:44.020]  even your six plant,
[14:44.020 --> 14:47.020]  just being here as an adult limit.
[14:47.020 --> 14:49.020]  And if you were dumb enough to take the risk,
[14:49.020 --> 14:51.020]  to move that back to Florida,
[14:51.020 --> 14:53.020]  just that smaller harvest,
[14:53.020 --> 14:57.020]  you could still make a fair living.
[14:57.020 --> 14:58.020]  Like it wouldn't be extravagant.
[14:58.020 --> 15:00.020]  You wouldn't be rolling back and forth at a brand new Escalade,
[15:00.020 --> 15:02.020]  but I mean,
[15:02.020 --> 15:05.020]  you could make enough to pay your rent and pay your bills,
[15:05.020 --> 15:08.820]  and pay your bills, but they're trying to do hundreds of plants because they're
[15:08.820 --> 15:12.060]  stupid and greedy and they think no one's going to notice here. And it's,
[15:12.080 --> 15:15.340]  that's just so insane. Like it's a neighborhood.
[15:16.460 --> 15:18.940]  If you, even if you do get it harvested and dried and cured,
[15:18.940 --> 15:20.900]  you're going to get pulled the fuck over as soon as you cross it.
[15:21.340 --> 15:26.020]  A couple of them got busted halfway to where they were headed because they just
[15:26.340 --> 15:29.220]  the turn signal violation, hundreds of pounds of weed in the car,
[15:29.220 --> 15:32.220]  smells like hundreds of pounds of weed in the car. Um,
[15:32.420 --> 15:35.700]  y'all know how bad your quarter ounce snakes on the way home from picking it up.
[15:36.260 --> 15:38.860]  Like magnify that by a hundred pounds.
[15:38.940 --> 15:43.020]  Yeah. Because you guys aren't being smart and vacuum sealing it and like doing it
[15:43.020 --> 15:43.620]  the right way.
[15:43.620 --> 15:46.780]  You're just putting it in trash bags and throwing it in the back and praying to
[15:46.780 --> 15:47.620]  God you'll make it there.
[15:47.620 --> 15:50.700]  Trash bags is the gangster way to carry some weed, don't you know that?
[15:50.700 --> 15:52.060]  That's the way to get cow.
[15:52.060 --> 15:53.100]  Two and a half D's.
[15:55.260 --> 15:57.100]  Just double bag that shit, you'll be fine.
[15:57.100 --> 15:59.780]  Do you remember my little, my little friend that's not real tall.
[15:59.780 --> 16:02.580]  He used to give me the trash bag, the clear trash bags full. Yeah.
[16:02.620 --> 16:05.620]  Back in the day that hypothetically happened. Remember that allegedly?
[16:06.340 --> 16:08.660]  Yeah. Those were good days.
[16:09.340 --> 16:10.420]  It's just insane.
[16:10.820 --> 16:12.660]  The days of coming up and growing big,
[16:12.660 --> 16:15.860]  ridiculous amounts of cannabis in Colorado, maybe coming to an end here.
[16:15.900 --> 16:18.420]  It's still possible if you're going, Oh, you gotta be smart about it.
[16:18.940 --> 16:20.060]  But be careful you guys,
[16:20.060 --> 16:22.220]  if you're going to come here from another state and think you're going to set up
[16:22.220 --> 16:25.660]  shop, read the rules, get, get really familiar with the rules. Be careful.
[16:25.780 --> 16:28.300]  The two parts of this that pissed me off the most was like, Hey,
[16:28.300 --> 16:31.300]  now we got to pay to send these fucks to jail and be,
[16:32.420 --> 16:37.060]  they're fucking up our reputation and they're giving a whole bunch of fire to
[16:37.060 --> 16:41.340]  the anti-pop people and they didn't need to fire. They, uh,
[16:41.380 --> 16:44.460]  they've lost two years in a row. Every time they spoke up,
[16:44.460 --> 16:48.380]  they got told fuck off and they're really, really angry.
[16:48.380 --> 16:50.380]  They don't need fuel for that fire. Yeah.
[16:50.500 --> 16:55.220]  They have 18 bus in seven weeks. Like a lot of fuels.
[16:55.500 --> 16:58.140]  And every single one of them was out in Pueblo West basically.
[16:59.260 --> 17:03.820]  Um, I mean, you've lived here for how long? Pueblo doesn't report shit. Um,
[17:04.580 --> 17:09.580]  and all of a sudden we've got 18 successful pot grow tips in seven weeks.
[17:11.060 --> 17:14.060]  Like there's some weird shit going on right now and people didn't see it coming.
[17:16.380 --> 17:17.980]  So if you're growing in Pueblo, be careful.
[17:20.340 --> 17:23.740]  That's Colorado wide right now, like gearing up for the election.
[17:23.740 --> 17:26.740]  We've got a new president coming in everywhere, everywhere.
[17:26.740 --> 17:29.100]  If you're growing everywhere, if you're growing, get your shit cleaned up.
[17:29.140 --> 17:32.500]  Now's a good time to think about it. If you, if you're a medical marijuana grower,
[17:33.060 --> 17:35.740]  if you've got a plant count, go count your fucking plants.
[17:35.780 --> 17:39.140]  Go consider like go get one under your plant count so that if some shit goes
[17:39.140 --> 17:41.860]  wrong and you break off a branch and it looks like an extra plan on accident,
[17:42.500 --> 17:44.220]  go check your gram weight, uh,
[17:44.380 --> 17:47.420]  get to your perfect gram weight and then roll up a fat joint and smoke it.
[17:47.420 --> 17:49.500]  So you're a fat joint underneath your gram limit.
[17:50.460 --> 17:53.140]  Just go get your shit in order. Mike looked at me like that's, that's good.
[17:53.140 --> 17:55.620]  No, that's a really good. I had that thought the other day. I was,
[17:55.620 --> 17:58.860]  I've got a nice hash pile going right now. And I was like, Hmm,
[17:59.540 --> 18:02.140]  like I can't even take this. Like when I move,
[18:02.140 --> 18:05.700]  technically I'll have to break the law moving this from house one to house two
[18:05.700 --> 18:07.980]  because I'm not supposed to have that much shit on the world.
[18:08.700 --> 18:10.340]  I'm over my gram limit.
[18:12.180 --> 18:13.780]  Wait, how much, wait, you've got to,
[18:14.300 --> 18:17.020]  can we talk about your extended plant count and your medical marijuana card?
[18:17.020 --> 18:17.860]  Can we talk about that?
[18:18.700 --> 18:20.940]  But just theoretically just for the legal rules.
[18:20.940 --> 18:24.460]  Cause at the same time I was thinking about needing to go get my card again.
[18:24.460 --> 18:28.620]  Like a lot of this applies to us too. Like we're not special, right? Um,
[18:28.660 --> 18:33.660]  we've got deadlines to reapply and dates to follow and card caps to adhere to.
[18:34.020 --> 18:37.260]  Yeah, we do. Yes. I gotta go. I get to go. I get to go.
[18:37.260 --> 18:41.580]  Should I get my doctor, my MMJ doctor, a shout out? Uh, I get to go. No,
[18:41.660 --> 18:45.460]  he dude, he would do. Fucking line is long enough. That's true. That is true.
[18:45.500 --> 18:47.780]  Yeah. Sorry guys. Mike just made a really good,
[18:48.660 --> 18:50.580]  it takes like four weeks to get into the fucking dude.
[18:51.340 --> 18:53.660]  I've got to go may 19th to go renew my shit.
[18:54.540 --> 18:57.020]  Will you give me his number? Yeah, thanks.
[18:57.940 --> 19:01.300]  I just really wanted to make them all feel bad that he was a few blocks from the
[19:01.300 --> 19:04.340]  office. I don't mind giving it to one or two people, but don't shout it out.
[19:04.380 --> 19:07.380]  I just, I was just trying to prove a point. It's okay.
[19:08.340 --> 19:09.940]  Oh, Bruce needs some business.
[19:11.780 --> 19:14.340]  Shout out to the same one up here, down there. Yeah. Yeah.
[19:14.340 --> 19:18.420]  You catch him on his Springs day. Yeah. He's in Springs like four days a week.
[19:18.460 --> 19:22.100]  Man. He's in Pueblo one day a week. So shout out to my MMJ doctor. He knows,
[19:22.380 --> 19:25.380]  he knows my conditions. He knows me well. When I walk in, he just starts writing.
[19:25.380 --> 19:28.020]  He goes, good to see you. What's this like the 10th time? And I'm like, yup.
[19:28.020 --> 19:29.420]  10 years in a row, buddy. Good to see you.
[19:30.860 --> 19:34.900]  No, I've, I've been a medical marijuana patient for probably close to 10 years.
[19:34.900 --> 19:38.220]  I'd say Mike's thinking back. Mike's got a better,
[19:38.660 --> 19:42.500]  I have a seven or eight for sure. I don't think we've got a decade yet.
[19:42.700 --> 19:43.820]  All right. Uh,
[19:44.420 --> 19:46.380]  Oh, did you guys go and get them together for the first time?
[19:46.420 --> 19:50.700]  Around similar time. It was the same, same year within a year.
[19:50.700 --> 19:54.220]  So you had one before me. Yeah, I was running a shop.
[19:54.380 --> 19:58.900]  And that's right. He came in as a patient with one, with another patient.
[19:58.900 --> 20:01.500]  And we got along.
[20:02.260 --> 20:04.260]  And we got along pretty well. It was love at first sight.
[20:06.260 --> 20:09.300]  I miss those days. It was insane. That place was fun. All right.
[20:09.340 --> 20:11.780]  We're reminiscing all chatterbox. You know, it's good.
[20:11.780 --> 20:14.020]  People like hearing insight to our lives.
[20:14.700 --> 20:17.740]  They really do. Because like guys like Seb, shout out to Ross to Seb.
[20:19.060 --> 20:22.780]  They don't get to sit around and be on a podcast and take dabs and live the life
[20:22.780 --> 20:25.300]  that we get to live. They got to fucking dodge ostriches.
[20:25.300 --> 20:28.060]  What does that fucking thing? He said, almost ran over. Was it an emu?
[20:28.820 --> 20:31.620]  Whatever that thing was said, what was that thing? Tell me, bro.
[20:32.780 --> 20:33.540]  Posted a video.
[20:33.540 --> 20:38.300]  He was driving in Australia and a giant long
[20:38.300 --> 20:42.180]  legged bird. It looked like an ostrich, but it may be, may, it could have been.
[20:42.180 --> 20:44.340]  That's what I thought. I guessed, but it could have been an emu.
[20:44.380 --> 20:47.980]  Right in front of that work of the video camera while you're driving, bro.
[20:47.980 --> 20:51.860]  Come on. Giant running birds. It's 2016.
[20:51.940 --> 20:54.260]  Everyone's got a dash cam of some sort going on.
[20:54.260 --> 20:57.140]  Everyone's Periscope and Snapchatting something. Don't judge the dude.
[20:57.140 --> 21:00.100]  He lives in Australia. I'm just, I'm just messing with Seb. Actually.
[21:00.660 --> 21:03.180]  Actually said, well, you're in Australia. Everything is trying to kill you.
[21:03.180 --> 21:04.780]  Put the phone down and pay the fuck attention.
[21:05.220 --> 21:07.020]  Everything in Australia wants to kill you.
[21:07.020 --> 21:08.140]  Before I said that, I was like,
[21:08.660 --> 21:12.740]  it's kind of like Russia where everyone has a camera on the mounted on their
[21:12.740 --> 21:16.180]  dashboard. And an M16. Yeah. It could be for different reasons.
[21:16.180 --> 21:19.500]  Like there it's because the odds of someone gets out and mugs use really high.
[21:19.540 --> 21:24.420]  They use AKs over there. Um, wow. Hi, how about you guys?
[21:27.340 --> 21:30.100]  I want to give a big shout out to my friends over at Elevate Glass and the
[21:30.100 --> 21:33.300]  lovely ladies and the one gentleman that run the place over at Elevate Glass.
[21:33.300 --> 21:36.500]  And also my good friends at Hemp Higher Elevation Masterpiece Productions.
[21:36.820 --> 21:39.420]  Make sure you guys check out the showroom. It's a Elevate Glass.
[21:39.420 --> 21:43.180]  It's 517 South Tahon in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Uh,
[21:43.220 --> 21:46.740]  make sure you tell them Rasta Jeff sent you. Please do that. Uh,
[21:46.860 --> 21:50.820]  I've got a brand new recycler rig here, uh, with the brand new banger on it.
[21:51.420 --> 21:53.660]  And I feel that just to the perfect level. And you can,
[21:54.140 --> 21:57.260]  you can really pull so hard and you don't get water in your face and you get a
[21:57.260 --> 22:01.740]  big fat globby dad. And I like it. It's nice. It does. It does. It does.
[22:02.140 --> 22:04.060]  All right. So, um, Mike,
[22:04.060 --> 22:06.820]  you were talking about some political stuff is why we've got you here.
[22:07.140 --> 22:10.220]  Oh, it's a, just the one thing I wanted to throw in right now is, uh,
[22:10.860 --> 22:15.860]  a lot of people are focused on the November election as they should be. Um,
[22:16.020 --> 22:19.220]  yay for paying attention. Good for you. Um, but
[22:21.900 --> 22:25.140]  I listened to a podcast the other night where he was like really mean to the
[22:25.140 --> 22:26.260]  listeners and you were like, damn.
[22:27.100 --> 22:27.940]  Um,
[22:29.980 --> 22:34.180]  uh, but there's a primary elections too in everybody's area in these matter.
[22:34.300 --> 22:37.580]  And no one ever turns out for these. Um,
[22:38.060 --> 22:40.700]  the example down here is this November.
[22:40.700 --> 22:45.340]  We might be voting to ban the recreational marijuana industry. However,
[22:45.820 --> 22:49.900]  before we even get to that vote possibly happening,
[22:49.940 --> 22:54.140]  there'll be election election, um, uh, primary election that, uh,
[22:54.180 --> 22:56.380]  sorry about that space, the work, uh,
[22:56.500 --> 23:00.100]  a primary election down here where we elect people like city councilmen and
[23:00.100 --> 23:02.660]  County commissioners and the local judge.
[23:03.140 --> 23:06.180]  And maybe there'll be a couple of small local issues.
[23:06.180 --> 23:10.180]  They get handled like city or County. Why are you going to run for? Um,
[23:10.220 --> 23:12.540]  nothing this round, but, uh,
[23:13.140 --> 23:16.940]  if two people down here happen to get elected instead of the two people that
[23:16.940 --> 23:19.900]  currently have this job getting reelected, um,
[23:19.940 --> 23:21.740]  retail marijuana could go away anyway,
[23:21.740 --> 23:25.860]  because the number of pro and anti-marijuana votes would swing that far with
[23:25.860 --> 23:29.220]  just two people getting swapped out. Um,
[23:29.300 --> 23:33.940]  so there's a lot going on politically in everyone's
[23:33.940 --> 23:36.420]  area that they need to be paying attention to right now.
[23:36.540 --> 23:40.820]  And right now is the time to go find out if you're registered to vote,
[23:41.260 --> 23:45.140]  go find out how that works in your area in Colorado. It's awesome.
[23:45.140 --> 23:47.260]  They just mail it to your house. You don't have to do anything,
[23:47.260 --> 23:50.460]  but check the mail. When it shows up, you fill it out,
[23:50.860 --> 23:52.420]  you take it to a drop off point.
[23:52.420 --> 23:55.740]  You get the sticker that says I voted and you get to be awesome for like the
[23:55.740 --> 24:00.460]  whole next year. It's really that simple. And other places, it's a little harder.
[24:00.460 --> 24:04.380]  You got to go stand in line, but do it like figure out how to do it.
[24:04.380 --> 24:07.540]  Now's the time to figure out how to do it. I know it's not till November.
[24:07.540 --> 24:10.620]  I know that's a long time away. I know a lot of you are like,
[24:10.660 --> 24:14.700]  I just planted my outdoor off like after harvest.
[24:17.460 --> 24:19.220]  Well, no, that's what a lot of people think right now.
[24:19.220 --> 24:22.740]  Like the election's not till November. Why pay attention? I'm not saying,
[24:23.140 --> 24:26.180]  I'm not telling them to fuck off. I'm telling them that I was thinking there's,
[24:26.980 --> 24:29.980]  they don't want to pay attention to politics yet because that's just months and
[24:29.980 --> 24:34.020]  months away. Like, but now's the time to get registered.
[24:34.020 --> 24:37.660]  Now's the time to start paying attention to what's going on in your area and
[24:37.660 --> 24:41.060]  start making sure you've done what you need to do to actually vote.
[24:42.940 --> 24:44.580]  I'm sick of the marijuana community.
[24:44.580 --> 24:47.060]  Just being a non-existent entity politically.
[24:47.540 --> 24:49.740]  Like we outnumber Christians.
[24:50.540 --> 24:54.700]  Think about the number of Christians that annoy you constantly because they're
[24:54.700 --> 24:55.820]  doing shit politically.
[24:56.500 --> 24:59.820]  Think about how powerful that particular group of people is in the United States.
[24:59.860 --> 25:04.220]  We outnumber NRA members by five times.
[25:05.740 --> 25:09.580]  And that's just the DEA's estimate for how many people smoke pot in the U S
[25:09.700 --> 25:13.180]  there are more pot smokers than gun toters. Yep. Wow.
[25:14.180 --> 25:18.140]  Shout out to all of us. We don't matter at all politically. Why?
[25:18.140 --> 25:21.020]  Because we don't show up. I got no hatred for anybody with a gun.
[25:21.020 --> 25:22.780]  If I said that condescendingly, I apologize.
[25:22.780 --> 25:24.420]  I respect anybody that carries a firearm.
[25:24.460 --> 25:28.940]  When you think about how much influence the NRA wields and then you look up the
[25:28.940 --> 25:32.220]  actual number of NRA members and their actual operating budget,
[25:32.780 --> 25:36.660]  it's terrifying how a group that small can be that influential.
[25:37.020 --> 25:41.820]  If we were just to get a little bit organized or at least just all show up on
[25:41.860 --> 25:46.860]  election day, we could have a serious authority coast to coast,
[25:47.500 --> 25:51.300]  but we don't. And we definitely, those of us that do show up,
[25:51.300 --> 25:55.860]  don't show up unified even a little bit. And I'm, yeah,
[25:56.020 --> 25:58.900]  I'm pushing your listeners. Get out, get out, start loading.
[25:58.940 --> 26:01.820]  We need, so we all, we all will take a party bus anywhere.
[26:01.820 --> 26:05.820]  If you put a dab rig on a bus and a bong on a bus, right.
[26:05.860 --> 26:08.260]  Put some Rasta man with dreadlocks and some reggae music,
[26:08.700 --> 26:10.740]  Rasta man driving it, reggae music playing real loud.
[26:10.740 --> 26:12.020]  And you paint a red, gold and green people,
[26:12.020 --> 26:14.700]  get on there and smoke some fucking hash and smoke some joints and have a good
[26:14.700 --> 26:17.180]  ass social time. Let's,
[26:17.740 --> 26:21.700]  let's get one of those and pick up stoners and drive them to polling places to
[26:21.700 --> 26:22.540]  get them to vote.
[26:22.820 --> 26:25.380]  It's not an unheard of idea.
[26:25.860 --> 26:30.300]  I'm hoping a couple of the industry players do something similar.
[26:30.580 --> 26:32.140]  Yeah. Somebody, somebody, uh,
[26:32.220 --> 26:36.660]  that doesn't work a lot and have a podcast and drive too much already helped me
[26:36.660 --> 26:38.860]  out with this, uh, put together like some buses to go.
[26:38.860 --> 26:42.140]  You like to show an owner or am I just too high? Is this real?
[26:43.500 --> 26:44.580]  Get a bus and drive people.
[26:44.580 --> 26:48.380]  I think that somewhere like Denver that would totally fly.
[26:48.460 --> 26:52.140]  I think some thing like Pueblo that might not.
[26:52.220 --> 26:54.300]  The token get away with driving them,
[26:55.300 --> 26:59.780]  smoking them out while you drive them requires a lot of extra insurance and a
[26:59.780 --> 27:01.340]  much, much larger vehicle.
[27:01.900 --> 27:05.980]  But every election there's groups that grab vans and go bus seniors and other
[27:05.980 --> 27:09.100]  people that love to vote and have trouble sometimes getting to the polling
[27:09.100 --> 27:11.740]  station and taking the seniors often vote though,
[27:11.740 --> 27:13.420]  whatever way they want them to vote.
[27:13.420 --> 27:17.300]  Like they'll go round up those people and take them free joint. If you, uh,
[27:17.340 --> 27:21.820]  if you vote, I think that's illegal. There's lots of little rules like that.
[27:25.180 --> 27:28.500]  But just giving them a ride that's helping someone perform their civic duty.
[27:29.460 --> 27:32.820]  Um, I'd love to see someone get in legal trouble for that.
[27:32.820 --> 27:34.180]  That'd be an awesome court case.
[27:36.100 --> 27:39.100]  But yeah, get involved, start Googling after the show.
[27:39.940 --> 27:41.260]  You could do it right now while you listen.
[27:41.380 --> 27:43.580]  You could, if you're at work, you could in your cubicle,
[27:44.180 --> 27:47.260]  the bosses of behind you and just fucking guns are Googling.
[27:48.940 --> 27:51.220]  You just wanted to know what election day was.
[27:51.220 --> 27:55.100]  So you could think about requesting it off because civic pride is important to
[27:55.100 --> 27:56.980]  you. Or if you're at work, just go to the bathroom.
[27:56.980 --> 27:59.620]  And actually you're taking a dump. Google that shit.
[28:00.100 --> 28:01.660]  Come back out and tell all of your friends about it.
[28:02.660 --> 28:04.660]  Lindsay, you're blushing like a mother.
[28:08.060 --> 28:08.900]  That's a good one.
[28:11.580 --> 28:12.660]  Sometimes, you know, you know,
[28:12.660 --> 28:14.820]  you've gotten there and taken like a seven minute pee just cause you're in
[28:14.820 --> 28:15.780]  there checking Instagram.
[28:15.860 --> 28:18.740]  Do you know how big that that place is?
[28:18.780 --> 28:23.460]  That's like not even a liable way to hide like viable, not liable.
[28:23.500 --> 28:25.220]  They can hear you double tap when you like something.
[28:26.780 --> 28:28.820]  You could like drop a pin in there and they'd hear that.
[28:29.180 --> 28:30.100]  This got weird again.
[28:32.020 --> 28:34.860]  I think something that Mike said on the last podcast though,
[28:34.860 --> 28:36.580]  that's really important to say again though,
[28:36.580 --> 28:41.020]  is that a lot of people this year are up for reelection and if we get the right
[28:41.020 --> 28:43.100]  people in the right seats,
[28:43.500 --> 28:47.580]  we could be looking at this moving a lot faster than we really thought it was
[28:47.580 --> 28:49.740]  going to. We're already at the breaking point.
[28:49.740 --> 28:52.860]  We're at 24 or 25 including,
[28:53.060 --> 28:56.780]  including a one for medical. It looks like it's going to be 25 here in a minute.
[28:56.900 --> 28:59.500]  But does that count Pennsylvania since Pennsylvania is legalized?
[28:59.500 --> 29:00.860]  Pennsylvania is 24 I believe.
[29:01.340 --> 29:04.700]  Okay. So 24 plus DC. So we're still looking at 25. We're,
[29:04.780 --> 29:07.060]  we're at the halfway mark where, you know,
[29:07.100 --> 29:09.500]  and it's funny cause my dad said something really interesting to me the other
[29:09.500 --> 29:13.380]  day that, um, at this point in, um, uh,
[29:13.420 --> 29:16.980]  gay marriage it had already steamrolled and it went across all 50.
[29:18.300 --> 29:20.780]  So maybe we just have to hold on for a little bit longer.
[29:20.780 --> 29:23.380]  Guess who showed up in big groups and voted.
[29:24.180 --> 29:26.900]  Mm. The gay.
[29:27.140 --> 29:30.900]  Anybody? Yes. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. You win yourself a tasty dab.
[29:32.740 --> 29:34.820]  I knew, but I didn't, I didn't know the appropriate way to answer.
[29:35.820 --> 29:38.740]  Mild. Shout out to shout out to my sisters.
[29:38.740 --> 29:40.500]  Cause I left that up to you.
[29:42.300 --> 29:43.940]  I have a lot of fun checking out chicks with Lindsay.
[29:44.580 --> 29:49.180]  That's definitely a fun thing to do. No, no. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[29:49.260 --> 29:51.980]  You're blushing before you can blush more. Who cares? Keep blushing.
[29:51.980 --> 29:54.820]  They can't see it on the show. You're just going to tell them about it.
[29:55.340 --> 29:56.620]  Yeah. Well, I mean, we don't,
[29:58.180 --> 29:59.620]  anybody that listens is our friend.
[30:01.780 --> 30:04.540]  I know I yell at you a lot. I just want to motivate you. Yeah.
[30:04.540 --> 30:08.580]  Mike doesn't mean to be a, no, Mike does mean to be motivating and inspiring.
[30:08.620 --> 30:09.660]  He wants you to go out and vote.
[30:10.260 --> 30:14.580]  There is a chance that we could lose recreational cannabis in Pueblo, Colorado.
[30:15.380 --> 30:16.540]  Well, that's tremendous.
[30:16.580 --> 30:20.580]  Politics and public opinion work on a pendulum. If you look at your history,
[30:21.060 --> 30:24.460]  we swing from liberal to conservative socially.
[30:25.100 --> 30:29.580]  And so social issues like this can swing back quickly.
[30:30.060 --> 30:31.660]  In the early seventies,
[30:31.860 --> 30:35.780]  we had a president that was thinking about legalizing marijuana nationally.
[30:36.380 --> 30:39.540]  We had a number of States that had passed medical marijuana laws.
[30:40.100 --> 30:42.980]  Does anybody remember these when we were children? No,
[30:42.980 --> 30:46.980]  cause the fucking eighties happened and public opinion swung back the other way
[30:46.980 --> 30:50.260]  hard. We decided to do a war on drugs instead of legalization.
[30:50.260 --> 30:55.260]  And we all know how that played out and had a couple of
[30:55.340 --> 30:58.980]  candidates stayed in the election or done better. Um,
[30:59.020 --> 31:00.740]  running up to this point,
[31:01.100 --> 31:04.900]  we could still have candidates that were promising to send the military to stop
[31:04.900 --> 31:06.380]  Colorado's weed stores.
[31:07.460 --> 31:12.460]  Like that's a reality in 2016 that we have a major popular,
[31:12.740 --> 31:15.660]  well-funded candidate for the highest office in the land.
[31:15.660 --> 31:18.900]  Who's talking about sending the army to shut down weed stores in Colorado.
[31:19.220 --> 31:20.460]  You guys work in the retail.
[31:20.860 --> 31:23.140]  What are you going to do when they want to take rolls up into the fucking
[31:23.140 --> 31:26.220]  parking lot? Well, silence.
[31:26.220 --> 31:30.340]  They both just because I work in the spring. So like, I don't know if that,
[31:30.380 --> 31:32.820]  well, I guess if it, if it goes away for good. Yeah.
[31:32.900 --> 31:35.420]  They're there first in the spring. They're already in the spring.
[31:35.460 --> 31:39.780]  When the tank shows up, I'm going to stop worrying about the consumption on site.
[31:39.780 --> 31:42.140]  We'll take it down real quick and bounce with my new rig.
[31:42.180 --> 31:45.260]  And as much hash as I can carry us, speaking of new rig,
[31:45.540 --> 31:48.460]  big shout out to my friend, Colorado Springs.
[31:49.340 --> 31:52.820]  Yeah. I think I would just have to look over and be like my bad hunt and start
[31:53.260 --> 31:56.660]  exactly like set up a station real quick and be like, so who wants a glob?
[31:58.020 --> 32:00.260]  I'm going to go outside and yell at the tank.
[32:05.140 --> 32:06.220]  Who the fuck is your boss?
[32:06.900 --> 32:09.780]  Well, no, I don't think that I don't think they think that I don't think they'd
[32:09.780 --> 32:10.980]  be surprised that I was like,
[32:10.980 --> 32:13.740]  who wants to help me carry all this stuff that we can carry out this window
[32:13.740 --> 32:15.980]  that's on the other side of the building from the tank.
[32:17.340 --> 32:21.860]  Oh my God. How much can we shove in our pockets and get out of here?
[32:22.340 --> 32:23.580]  I'm poofing. I keep Cola.
[32:23.940 --> 32:24.780]  Is it weird?
[32:29.580 --> 32:32.140]  I can't. The question is, did I take the lid off or not?
[32:36.100 --> 32:39.340]  Tiny bubbles. This was one of the weirdest podcasts I've ever done.
[32:39.420 --> 32:40.860]  It's cause it started.
[32:40.900 --> 32:44.620]  Tweet us your thoughts. Yeah, it started around. It started after we started
[32:44.620 --> 32:48.900]  dabbing at 1140 to record. This is bound to have, it's been a long day.
[32:49.220 --> 32:52.140]  It has. It's been a great day though. Yeah. Big, big,
[32:52.340 --> 32:54.500]  big huge respect to everybody that I had fun with.
[32:54.500 --> 32:59.020]  So you know who I always shout out to a fucking Cooper, bro.
[32:59.060 --> 33:03.100]  Coops. Uh, you're doing the 22 pushups every day.
[33:03.580 --> 33:06.620]  When he started off really like a wiggle worm by like day three, bro,
[33:06.620 --> 33:08.860]  you're doing pushups, man. I'm proud of you. Uh,
[33:08.860 --> 33:11.940]  I think it's inspiring that you actually, uh,
[33:11.980 --> 33:15.060]  posted the videos from the beginning when you knew you weren't killing it.
[33:15.220 --> 33:17.900]  Cause I'm sure by day 22, you're going to look like a fucking Marine dude.
[33:17.900 --> 33:19.900]  So shout out. That is awesome. Much respect.
[33:20.460 --> 33:23.180]  A lot of people wouldn't even have the heart or the balls to try it.
[33:23.780 --> 33:26.500]  Let alone post the videos that you posted. So that's fucking cool.
[33:26.780 --> 33:30.260]  Yeah. Lindsay's over here putting her hand up. I haven't done it. I'll do it.
[33:30.300 --> 33:33.940]  I, I, I, I don't even know if I can throw down 22 to tell you the truth.
[33:34.180 --> 33:37.940]  I'll try it. I can't 22 girl ones. I got you in 22 girl ones. That's why I,
[33:38.020 --> 33:39.340]  I told you that story, right?
[33:39.900 --> 33:43.620]  That hunt had posted it and he had called out all of the nugs family and I'd
[33:43.620 --> 33:46.220]  liked it by accident before I like read through the whole comment.
[33:46.220 --> 33:48.980]  And I was like, now I'm like obligated, but like,
[33:48.980 --> 33:50.300]  I don't know how to do pushups.
[33:50.380 --> 33:52.860]  That's what I was going to give a shout out to you next was our boy hunt.
[33:52.940 --> 33:56.380]  You like something without reading the whole post and now you have to like learn
[33:56.380 --> 33:57.700]  a new physical activity.
[33:58.780 --> 34:02.140]  And I couldn't like, unlike it. Cause I feel like that was rude too. So, I mean,
[34:02.140 --> 34:05.060]  not like he would've noticed, right. But I like, I don't know. I just was like,
[34:05.100 --> 34:06.700]  all right, I'm just going to leave this here. Like pretty good.
[34:07.540 --> 34:08.900]  But big shout outs to hunt.
[34:08.900 --> 34:12.860]  What we're talking about is the 22 pushups for veterans because, uh,
[34:13.180 --> 34:15.300]  every so frequently, I don't remember the stats. I don't have the post.
[34:15.540 --> 34:19.980]  It's every day, every day. Thank you, Mike. Every day, 22 veterans commit suicide.
[34:20.140 --> 34:25.100]  So some of my friends are posting to Facebook videos of themselves doing 22
[34:25.100 --> 34:28.980]  pushups every day for 22 days straight to raise awareness for veterans, uh,
[34:28.980 --> 34:31.180]  to show support for veterans, to help out,
[34:31.180 --> 34:34.500]  to encourage people to reach out to veterans. So big shout out to John Hunt,
[34:34.860 --> 34:36.620]  uh, not just for doing this pushup challenge,
[34:36.900 --> 34:40.380]  but cause he's a bad motherfucker every single day in every single way. Uh,
[34:40.420 --> 34:43.100]  that dude's an inspiration. He inspired coop to do pushups.
[34:43.100 --> 34:45.740]  He inspired me to do some pushups. He's going to inspire Lindsay to do them.
[34:45.740 --> 34:49.660]  Before too long. Uh, he should be pushes everybody to the next level, uh,
[34:49.700 --> 34:53.500]  in all aspects. That's an inside joke aspects. Uh,
[34:53.500 --> 34:56.060]  if you hang out with hunt one time, you'll see why he's the word aspects,
[34:56.300 --> 34:58.820]  but a shout out to hunt. You're a bad motherfucker. So, uh, yeah,
[34:58.820 --> 35:02.580]  some people that deserve to shout out. Everybody just nods.
[35:02.700 --> 35:05.580]  For sure. Yeah. They can't hear our nods. I always think about it.
[35:06.860 --> 35:11.460]  They're happening. Uh, and if I'm going to talk about veterans, I didn't plan.
[35:11.460 --> 35:13.500]  This wasn't part of the show. I was going to give a shout out to Coupon hunt.
[35:13.780 --> 35:15.180]  Uh, Steve DeFino, my friend,
[35:15.340 --> 35:18.020]  you deserve a huge shout out for what you do with the veteran farmers Alliance.
[35:18.020 --> 35:21.380]  If you guys are a veteran or have a friend or relative, that's a veteran,
[35:21.380 --> 35:23.660]  make sure you get them in touch with the veteran farmers Alliance.
[35:23.660 --> 35:27.420]  I had a listener that sent me a message saying they wanted to get in touch with
[35:27.420 --> 35:31.580]  Steve and I gave Steve your contact info is easier for me to do it that way.
[35:31.580 --> 35:34.540]  Steve said he's attempted to contact you. So I hope that has gone through.
[35:34.900 --> 35:37.140]  So yeah, that was random. That was a sidebar. Uh,
[35:37.180 --> 35:40.700]  but shout out to all the people raising awareness for the veterans.
[35:41.460 --> 35:42.500]  Yeah, no, that's awesome.
[35:43.780 --> 35:47.740]  We need to be doing a lot more and anything to raise awareness. I'm for, yes.
[35:47.820 --> 35:52.740]  For anything that's worth raising awareness for. Absolutely. Yeah. Um,
[35:52.780 --> 35:54.660]  all right. We've been going for a little while. Uh,
[35:54.660 --> 35:56.300]  anybody got any final words to say, well,
[35:56.300 --> 35:58.700]  you've got a microphone in front of you and a whole bunch of people are going to
[35:58.700 --> 36:00.100]  hear your opinions and thoughts.
[36:01.260 --> 36:03.340]  I laid down pretty much what I had to lay down.
[36:03.380 --> 36:06.340]  Yeah, you did go out and get your shit registered to vote and vote when the time
[36:06.340 --> 36:08.420]  comes, because if we don't, we're going to lose fucking weed.
[36:08.620 --> 36:13.180]  Do it. I just seriously, we don't want to start taking steps back now. Um,
[36:13.220 --> 36:17.500]  and that's what could easily happen in, uh,
[36:17.540 --> 36:19.020]  the next couple of election cycles.
[36:19.500 --> 36:21.500]  Mike, how can really walk this backwards?
[36:21.580 --> 36:23.100]  How can people find you on Twitter?
[36:23.220 --> 36:28.300]  You can find me at, uh, at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter or at Pueblo for
[36:28.340 --> 36:30.460]  sensible cannabis laws on Facebook. There you go.
[36:30.460 --> 36:34.140]  Make sure you support Mike's Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws, Facebook page.
[36:34.540 --> 36:35.780]  Uh, Mike knows a lot about cannabis.
[36:35.780 --> 36:40.260]  He knows a lot about local cannabis laws and rules. Thanks dude.
[36:41.100 --> 36:42.100]  Thank you, buddy.
[36:44.420 --> 36:48.780]  Did we just mental fist bump? I think that just happened. Awesome.
[36:49.100 --> 36:51.620]  Miss Lindsay, the beautiful, how can people find you on the Twitter?
[36:51.820 --> 36:55.780]  Oh man, I'm actually trying to use Twitter more. So please actually tweet at me.
[36:55.940 --> 36:57.460]  I'm the travel stoner.
[36:58.220 --> 36:59.300]  Just the travel stoner.
[36:59.300 --> 37:02.340]  Yeah. Someone took the traveling stoner. I know,
[37:02.580 --> 37:05.500]  but you guys can find me on Instagram too, as the traveling stoner.
[37:05.580 --> 37:08.140]  Yeah. Check her out on Insta. Can we tell them about your Snapchat?
[37:08.580 --> 37:11.460]  Yeah, sure. It's traveling stoner without the G.
[37:11.940 --> 37:15.220]  Are you the one responsible for the Snapchat for greener, healthy wellness?
[37:15.380 --> 37:16.260]  And the mass roots.
[37:16.300 --> 37:19.300]  And the mass roots. So give those pages a shout out for us so that we can get
[37:19.300 --> 37:20.140]  more follows.

[37:25.340 --> 37:26.780]  roots and Snapchat.

[37:34.540 --> 37:36.820]  the beautiful bud tender at green and healthy wellness.
[37:36.820 --> 37:39.740]  Since a couple of the lovely young ladies have had to move on to better
[37:39.740 --> 37:42.900]  adventures, better ventures. What the fuck is the word there? Ventures. Sure.
[37:42.940 --> 37:47.100]  Whatever they've moved on. It's now Lindsay is, uh, picking up the slack,
[37:47.380 --> 37:51.340]  killing it over there, killing it. Thank you. Um,
[37:51.460 --> 37:54.220]  should we even talk about the flowers that were on the shelf that were grown by
[37:54.260 --> 37:57.460]  me that are probably sold out by the time this episode drops?
[37:57.500 --> 37:59.540]  Yeah, they, they will definitely be gone,
[37:59.540 --> 38:02.220]  but there'll be more of those strains on the shelves later, right?
[38:02.260 --> 38:04.380]  There'll be more stuff coming. There's there, uh,
[38:04.420 --> 38:06.540]  we are going to keep good stuff coming on the shelves.
[38:06.980 --> 38:09.580]  I've gotten it under control now. It's going to be awesome.
[38:10.460 --> 38:13.740]  We've got a lot of good things coming. I think everything is going great.
[38:14.220 --> 38:16.540]  Shout out to Turpex for the new packaging. That looks dope.
[38:16.740 --> 38:21.100]  Shout out to Turpex in general. Just, yeah,
[38:21.820 --> 38:22.780]  I'm a huge fan too.
[38:23.780 --> 38:26.380]  Hey Jordan, when are we going to put the band back together?
[38:28.180 --> 38:30.260]  Yeah. Also a fan of the music boys. Well done.
[38:30.340 --> 38:32.260]  Oh, so should we get them back on the show again?
[38:32.740 --> 38:34.740]  Yes. A million times. Yes.
[38:34.780 --> 38:36.620]  All right. You Turpey boys. Uh, they don't,
[38:36.620 --> 38:39.940]  I don't think they listened to the show. Jordan, Dan, Shane,
[38:40.180 --> 38:43.140]  we got to get you on the show boys. All right.
[38:43.260 --> 38:45.540]  So we've been going for a long time. I feel like, uh, I've got ADD.
[38:45.540 --> 38:47.340]  So the listeners probably have got ADD by now.
[38:47.340 --> 38:50.380]  I want to thank my friends for joining me. Uh, it's fucking Thursday.
[38:50.540 --> 38:53.580]  Well, now it's Friday morning, Thursday night at 1am.
[38:53.580 --> 38:56.820]  And we're recording a podcast taking dabs. So, uh, once again,
[38:56.820 --> 38:59.500]  I do have to give huge love to my friends at elevate glass for this new
[38:59.500 --> 39:02.820]  recycler rig that they gave me a shout out to all the lovely ladies and the one
[39:02.820 --> 39:06.180]  gentleman down there. And also shout out to the adorable little dogs. Uh,
[39:06.180 --> 39:10.780]  the one dog ate a packet of Taco Bell hot sauce and it smelled like an atomic
[39:10.780 --> 39:12.740]  bomb went off in that store for a couple of seconds,
[39:12.740 --> 39:15.380]  but it was really funny because the dog is so cute that it was worth it.
[39:16.460 --> 39:17.380]  The look on your face.
[39:17.660 --> 39:19.260]  I know cause I know what dogs you're talking about.
[39:19.260 --> 39:22.980]  Cause I've been in there before. So like, I can only imagine they're so cute
[39:22.980 --> 39:23.340]  though.
[39:23.340 --> 39:26.020]  You dropped a bomb. So shout out to all my,
[39:26.060 --> 39:29.220]  my lovely friends over at elevate glass. Uh, they treat me like royalty there.
[39:29.460 --> 39:33.060]  If you need glass and you're in the Colorado Springs area, go check them out.
[39:33.180 --> 39:35.380]  That's a dope ass place. Tell them I sent you, please do it.
[39:35.380 --> 39:37.980]  Make sure you let them know that Ross to Jeff sent you mentioned that shit.
[39:39.060 --> 39:42.860]  All right. We're going to get out of here. Um, yeah. All right.
[39:42.860 --> 39:45.580]  All you guys got to do now is go to iTunes, uh,
[39:45.620 --> 39:48.180]  search for the review section and search for the girl from your heart podcast.
[39:48.460 --> 39:51.060]  Give me a rating. Uh, I'm not going to tell you to give me five stars.
[39:51.100 --> 39:52.420]  You do what you think I deserve.
[39:52.500 --> 39:55.420]  I think asking for five stars might've been like a cheap thing to do.
[39:55.620 --> 39:57.580]  That's not cool. You may not think I deserve five.
[39:57.860 --> 40:00.100]  Give me what you really feel that I deserve. That sounds fair.
[40:00.380 --> 40:02.500]  Type in a comment. Let me know what you think about the podcast.
[40:02.820 --> 40:05.860]  And I will read your comments on a future episode.

[40:35.540 --> 40:37.060]  Cause I thought you were looking at me funny for it.

[41:38.000 --> 41:41.120]  We reap what we sow and we keep on progressing.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.720]  When you think you got it, but somebody got it.
[41:46.440 --> 41:51.440]  Feeling sad and oh well somebody feeling sad to give on to your sister and your
[41:51.640 --> 41:52.480]  brother.

[42:38.080 --> 42:42.640]  Test and said he'd lend a hand and told me he would mow me to an independent
[42:42.640 --> 42:47.760]  man. Now I'm looking at me. I'm a losing the dream.
[42:47.760 --> 42:55.000]  I just won't let an opportunity is what y'all giving me.
[42:55.160 --> 42:58.040]  So I'm a spread my love from the scene out to the babies.
[42:58.200 --> 43:01.640]  Respect for my brethren and smiles for the ladies. You can look,
[43:01.760 --> 43:05.160]  but you can't touch cause I might hurt looking clean in them.
[43:05.160 --> 43:08.800]  Rocker wear jeans and that white shirt. And yes, I might flirt,
[43:09.080 --> 43:11.560]  but that's my downfall. So many lovely ladies.
[43:11.600 --> 43:30.860]  And I think I love family with me.
[43:30.860 --> 43:32.100]  I feel blessed.

[47:21.510 --> 47:23.870]  I got one more thing. I do have to remind you guys of,
[47:23.870 --> 47:26.710]  I've got an update is what this is on episode number one 26.
[47:26.710 --> 47:31.710]  We're talking about the organization that was passing out joints to people who
[47:31.870 --> 47:33.350]  collected trash in the park.
[47:33.350 --> 47:36.550]  And we made a comment about how it was not cool that they were giving out joints
[47:36.550 --> 47:38.830]  in the park. I've been corrected. You guys,
[47:38.830 --> 47:41.430]  big shout out to Lindsay and Chris for correcting me.
[47:41.710 --> 47:43.790]  They were listening to the podcast and they were like, Hey dude,
[47:43.830 --> 47:46.790]  they did not give the joints out in the park. Uh, what happened?
[47:47.030 --> 47:51.190]  So we did an article where people collect the trash in the park and they cleaned
[47:51.190 --> 47:53.470]  up the park. And after they picked up the trash, they got a free joint.
[47:53.830 --> 47:54.750]  It was under my assumption.
[47:54.750 --> 47:57.710]  They got the joint at the park because of the news kind of made it look that way.
[47:57.950 --> 48:01.670]  I was told that they got a coupon and they had to take the coupon to the smoke
[48:01.670 --> 48:06.150]  club and the smoke club then gave them a joint when they presented proper ID
[48:06.150 --> 48:08.550]  and that coupon. So a correction had to be made.
[48:08.550 --> 48:11.470]  They did not give the joints out at the park. Uh, they did it correctly.
[48:11.470 --> 48:13.910]  So shout out and also shout out to my friends for correcting me.
[48:13.910 --> 48:16.510]  I do appreciate that. All right.
[48:16.510 --> 48:19.190]  I hope everybody had a great week because I am recording on a Saturday.
[48:19.190 --> 48:23.430]  Usually I record on a Thursday, but this week was chaotic this week on Thursday.
[48:23.430 --> 48:27.030]  I had a medical marijuana doctor at nine 30 in the morning in Colorado Springs.
[48:27.030 --> 48:30.190]  Then I worked all day and then I went to the secret sesh. Uh,
[48:30.310 --> 48:34.590]  the secret session was amazing. Uh, I almost forgot part of my day. I got up,
[48:34.590 --> 48:38.270]  I drove to Colorado Springs and then I got stuck in a fucking elevator. Yes.
[48:38.270 --> 48:41.670]  I've never been stuck in an elevator before, but Thursday morning it happened.
[48:41.670 --> 48:45.750]  I was stuck in an elevator with two strangers. I wasn't in there for very long.
[48:46.230 --> 48:48.190]  It was a little bit freaky, but I didn't panic or anything.
[48:48.190 --> 48:50.710]  So I was like, whatever, I'm just in an elevator. People know I'm here.
[48:50.710 --> 48:53.270]  Someone's going to get me out. It wasn't that big of a deal. Uh,
[48:53.350 --> 48:54.790]  one of the people in the elevator,
[48:54.790 --> 48:57.870]  it was a couple and the older dude was getting a little bit pissed off that he
[48:57.910 --> 49:00.270]  was stuck in an elevator. There's no reason for him to be mad,
[49:00.270 --> 49:04.590]  but I think just the simple idea that he was stuck, pissed him off. Um,
[49:04.630 --> 49:06.670]  I was going to the medical marijuana doctor. I walked in,
[49:06.990 --> 49:10.030]  there's no stairs at this building. Oddly. Uh, there's an elevator,
[49:10.070 --> 49:13.190]  got in the elevator. Uh, more people walked in and held the door for them.
[49:13.230 --> 49:17.470]  I hit floor three, it started to go, it went, and then it stopped.
[49:17.470 --> 49:19.630]  And I looked at the dude and I was like, I don't know that I want to be in here.
[49:20.030 --> 49:22.270]  And he said, I think we're stuck in here. And I said, if it stops,
[49:22.270 --> 49:25.990]  and then it stopped. And I was like, well, shit. And so I first,
[49:26.110 --> 49:29.030]  my first instinct was trying to pull the door open just to see where we are.
[49:29.030 --> 49:31.070]  You know, how far up did we go? How far down did we go?
[49:31.070 --> 49:33.750]  I don't know where the fuck we went. Uh, pull, try to pull the door open.
[49:33.790 --> 49:36.270]  It was stuck. It was good and stuck. So nothing was going to happen.
[49:36.270 --> 49:39.510]  There's a little, uh, uh, an alarm button on the elevator. I hit that.
[49:39.510 --> 49:41.310]  And then there's a button that says, call for help. I hit that.
[49:41.950 --> 49:45.030]  A couple of seconds later, a young lady answered and she's like, hello.
[49:45.110 --> 49:47.750]  And I was like, did I just call the front desk or what the fuck just happened?
[49:47.750 --> 49:49.150]  And I was like, Hey, I'm stuck in the elevator.
[49:49.590 --> 49:52.590]  And she asked if I was at the address where I was. And I confirmed that.
[49:52.590 --> 49:55.030]  And she said, okay, hang tight. We'll send someone to get you out.
[49:55.630 --> 49:58.790]  And I was like, well, that's like kind of just basic. You know what I mean?
[49:58.830 --> 50:00.990]  Like ask if we're okay or some shit. Jeez.
[50:01.390 --> 50:04.470]  So we sat in the elevator for a few minutes and then another person,
[50:05.230 --> 50:07.550]  I kept hitting the little alarm button. They would just go jingle, jingle,
[50:07.550 --> 50:08.990]  jingle so that somebody would know I was in there.
[50:09.470 --> 50:11.870]  And then another person came in and like, Hey, are you stuck? And I was like,
[50:11.870 --> 50:14.950]  yes, we're stuck. And she just started pushing buttons. And when she pushed,
[50:15.430 --> 50:17.550]  I don't know which button, cause I wasn't there. When she pushed the button,
[50:17.870 --> 50:21.070]  I could feel the elevator shift a little bit. And I said, Hey, keep doing that.
[50:21.710 --> 50:23.590]  And then I saw through the crack in the door,
[50:23.590 --> 50:26.790]  I could see that we were only six or eight inches up off the ground.
[50:26.790 --> 50:28.670]  We'd only moved half a foot. So I was like,
[50:28.670 --> 50:32.030]  keep doing that because we're going down every time she did it. And then I saw,
[50:32.670 --> 50:34.150]  I saw the little threshold piece,
[50:34.150 --> 50:36.470]  like where the elevator would fit into the floor and I was like, hold on,
[50:36.470 --> 50:37.830]  hold on. I want to see something. Quit pushing it.
[50:38.070 --> 50:39.150]  I didn't want her to squish my fingers.
[50:39.150 --> 50:41.510]  And I stuck my fingers in there and I totally just pulled the door open.
[50:41.510 --> 50:44.710]  So I was able to slide the door open once you got it a little bit lower. Uh,
[50:44.710 --> 50:47.870]  we were a little bit late for our medical marijuana doctor appointment,
[50:47.910 --> 50:50.950]  but uh, what can you do? I called them and I said, Hey, I'm stuck in the elevator.
[50:50.950 --> 50:52.910]  So please don't screw up my appointment. And they took me,
[50:53.270 --> 50:56.350]  they got me in there. Big shout out to my medical marijuana doctor. Um,
[50:56.390 --> 50:58.310]  I can't say, I don't think I should say his name on the air.
[50:58.350 --> 51:01.910]  Cause he's crowded already. But yeah, if you know my medical marijuana doctor,
[51:01.910 --> 51:04.550]  you give him a high five. That was quick. It was a quick, easy appointment.
[51:04.550 --> 51:07.070]  I got everything handled the way that I needed to, uh,
[51:07.110 --> 51:08.710]  got out of the elevator and went to the doctor,
[51:08.830 --> 51:11.030]  saw the doctor went and took care of the gardens all day.
[51:11.030 --> 51:13.430]  Big shout out to John Randall's jr. Big shout out to Zach.
[51:13.470 --> 51:16.230]  Also a huge shout out to hunt. Everybody kicked ass in the garden.
[51:16.590 --> 51:18.270]  Then you guys, I got to wrap it up. Oh,
[51:18.270 --> 51:20.670]  I went to the dispensary and bought a bunch of Turpex shatter.
[51:20.670 --> 51:24.630]  Big shout out to Turpex. The new packaging is dope. And, uh, that lemon G,
[51:24.670 --> 51:28.870]  I might've grown that, that lemon G, uh, live resin, that stuff was fire.
[51:28.870 --> 51:32.230]  You guys, this stuff was so tasty. So then I went and got some hash.
[51:32.230 --> 51:36.070]  And then I headed up to Denver where I went to the secret sesh and I met up with
[51:36.070 --> 51:37.630]  our buddy John hunt. And you guys,
[51:37.630 --> 51:40.590]  I want to give a shout out to everybody that I got to dab with at the secret
[51:40.590 --> 51:44.110]  sesh. I dabbed with so many people that I'm not even going to say one name.
[51:44.110 --> 51:46.710]  Cause I will forget somebody. So if you were at secret session, we took a dab,
[51:47.150 --> 51:49.390]  much love. I was at the secret session.
[51:49.390 --> 51:52.990]  I was dabbing and Adam mill said I'm higher than everybody here.
[51:53.470 --> 51:55.990]  And I was kind of pretty sure that I was higher than him. So I was like, no,
[51:55.990 --> 51:58.790]  you're not. And he saw me. He goes, Ross and Jeff, I see you shaking your head.
[51:58.790 --> 52:02.590]  Come here, bro. And he called me up to the stage. I went to the stage. He, uh,
[52:02.590 --> 52:05.230]  his buddy Tim gave me, and that was at least a gram.
[52:05.230 --> 52:08.390]  I think it took a gram and a half dab on the stage at the secret session for
[52:08.390 --> 52:09.790]  everybody and did not choke.
[52:09.790 --> 52:13.030]  And then we brought up a couple of people on the stage and dab them out. Uh,
[52:13.070 --> 52:14.030]  that was a pretty good time.
[52:14.030 --> 52:17.590]  But honestly I was lit up because I would give people like a two gram dab and
[52:17.590 --> 52:19.390]  whatever they couldn't take, I would finish it for them.
[52:19.390 --> 52:21.230]  And oftentimes it was most of a gram.
[52:21.670 --> 52:24.350]  You try to dab somebody a two gram dab and they start choking and they look at
[52:24.350 --> 52:27.390]  you like I'm done. So I would just grab it and finish it. So it was pretty late.
[52:27.390 --> 52:29.870]  We took a little break and went and sat in the green room and I ate a bunch of
[52:29.870 --> 52:33.190]  Cheetos, uh, drink some Dr. Pepper. I usually don't need a bunch of crap,
[52:33.190 --> 52:34.670]  but I needed some crap in my body.
[52:34.670 --> 52:37.310]  So I had a bunch of junk and got my shit back together. Uh,
[52:37.310 --> 52:39.950]  while I was sitting in the green room, chilling out, our good friend,
[52:39.950 --> 52:42.670]  Lindsay, the traveling stoner showed up and she had her beautiful friend,
[52:42.670 --> 52:45.150]  Molly with her shout out to Lindsay and Molly. Uh,
[52:45.190 --> 52:48.350]  they encouraged me to have another bag of chips and get my shit together and
[52:48.350 --> 52:51.790]  then get back to the party. So, uh, Lindsay and our new friend,
[52:51.790 --> 52:55.230]  Molly and I went and cruised around the secret sesh and, um,
[52:55.750 --> 52:59.790]  shout out to our friend at TNT extractions. That dude gave me a donut.
[52:59.830 --> 53:04.310]  They got me wrecked. Um, shout out to whoever made the strawberry lemonade,
[53:04.350 --> 53:08.710]  or the pink lemonade cupcakes with the chocolate or the peppermint bark on top
[53:08.710 --> 53:11.790]  of them. Sorry. I'm, my brain still may be fuzzy from the secret sesh.
[53:12.110 --> 53:15.790]  I think there were 250 or 300 milligrams each and I ate two of those.
[53:16.350 --> 53:18.230]  I had some fruit,
[53:18.230 --> 53:21.630]  there was pineapple and strawberries and some other random fruit that was chopped
[53:21.630 --> 53:25.430]  up that had medicated chocolate ganache that was hot on top of it.
[53:25.870 --> 53:29.350]  That stuff was so tasty. Uh, so the secret session, I got stupid lit.
[53:29.350 --> 53:31.950]  If you walked up and tried to talk to me and I was kind of non-responsive,
[53:31.950 --> 53:32.830]  I do apologize.
[53:32.910 --> 53:36.870]  I had eaten about 850 to a thousand milligrams of edibles and I had smoked
[53:36.870 --> 53:38.070]  about four or five grams of hash.
[53:38.070 --> 53:40.830]  So I was in no condition to be conversational. I apologize,
[53:40.830 --> 53:43.110]  but shout out to everyone at the secret session. I had a good ass time.
[53:43.510 --> 53:48.030]  Huge shout out to our friends at TNT extractions and Schumet
[53:48.430 --> 53:50.150]  bars, uh, Schumet edibles.
[53:50.670 --> 53:55.670]  Those dudes gave me a 1000 milligram edible and I ate that 1000 milligram
[53:55.710 --> 53:58.670]  edible yesterday, uh, on my way to work.
[53:59.590 --> 54:00.670]  And by the time I got to work,
[54:00.670 --> 54:04.310]  it felt like somebody had replaced my blood with sand.
[54:04.630 --> 54:08.670]  My body was so dry and heavy that I just wanted to curl up in a corner and take
[54:08.710 --> 54:12.630]  a nap. I have not been that ridiculously high in a long time.
[54:12.630 --> 54:15.430]  A thousand milligrams is no joke. You guys, I do not recommend it.
[54:15.790 --> 54:17.150]  I don't know that I want to do it again.
[54:17.590 --> 54:21.830]  I feel like I wasted probably a day and a half because the entire day I was
[54:21.830 --> 54:23.430]  useless. And then half of today,
[54:23.430 --> 54:25.430]  it took me half of today to get my shit together.
[54:25.750 --> 54:28.350]  So a thousand milligrams will fuck you up if that's what you're looking for.
[54:28.350 --> 54:31.430]  But Oh my God, I don't recommend it. It was an adventure. Uh,
[54:31.430 --> 54:33.750]  it was like a shamanic journey. Uh,
[54:33.790 --> 54:35.590]  but I had to go and live my day doing it.
[54:35.590 --> 54:38.430]  I had to go to work and I had to function. So that was kind of hard.
[54:38.430 --> 54:40.790]  Don't do that unless you can lay around and just be lazy.
[54:41.550 --> 54:43.710]  So shout out to those folks. Shout out to the secret session. You guys,
[54:43.710 --> 54:46.150]  if you can make it to the next secret sesh, you need to be there.
[54:46.150 --> 54:47.750]  Big shout out to Adam Mill and all those kids.
[54:48.110 --> 54:50.710]  I'm not going to try to list names cause I will forget mad people,
[54:51.430 --> 54:53.470]  but we're going to move forward. And you guys,
[54:53.470 --> 54:55.750]  I want to get into some iTunes comments.
[54:55.750 --> 54:57.470]  We haven't read the iTunes comments in a long time.
[54:57.470 --> 55:00.190]  I think there are one or two more that we haven't read.
[55:00.190 --> 55:04.230]  So I'm pulling up iTunes right now. I'm getting to the comment section.
[55:04.510 --> 55:07.270]  I would like it. If you guys would go to iTunes, find the,
[55:07.270 --> 55:10.550]  go to the iTunes store, search for the growth from your heart podcast,
[55:10.590 --> 55:12.510]  find the review section, type in a little comment,
[55:12.990 --> 55:14.710]  give me the amount of stars that you feel I deserve.
[55:14.710 --> 55:16.990]  And let me know what you think about the show because I really do appreciate
[55:17.230 --> 55:19.670]  reading the comments. All right, I am here. I'm where I need to be.
[55:19.670 --> 55:22.750]  I found the new comments. Our new comment comes from our friend,
[55:22.750 --> 55:24.870]  tarantula Hawk. He gave us five stars.
[55:24.870 --> 55:29.350]  He left this comment May 18th, 2016 and the comment goes like this to date.
[55:29.510 --> 55:32.870]  This is hands down the best informational cannabis grow podcast.
[55:32.910 --> 55:36.950]  Rasta Jeff doesn't overload you with endless advertising, informative,
[55:36.950 --> 55:40.790]  free and entertaining. Much love to Jeff and the crew. Give your mom a hug for me.
[55:40.830 --> 55:45.710]  If you like it, review it and donate a few bucks straight up. It's that good.
[55:46.190 --> 55:49.150]  That is a hell of a good comment. Thank you. I appreciate that. Uh,
[55:49.150 --> 55:53.310]  that's something I noticed when I used to listen to another cannabis podcast,
[55:54.070 --> 55:57.710]  people would ask a grow question and instead of giving solid grow advice,
[55:57.750 --> 56:01.590]  the host of that show would sell you a product and it wouldn't solve your
[56:01.590 --> 56:03.670]  problem. It would temporarily solve your problem.
[56:03.670 --> 56:05.390]  It would mask your problem is what it would do.
[56:05.670 --> 56:07.350]  And then you'd have to keep buying that product.
[56:07.350 --> 56:10.510]  What I like to do is if you have a problem in your grow, if you say, Hey,
[56:10.510 --> 56:11.350]  I have spider mites.
[56:11.350 --> 56:13.550]  I like to help you figure out how you're getting spider mites,
[56:13.710 --> 56:16.430]  teach you how to correct that so that you don't ever get mites again.
[56:16.430 --> 56:20.070]  Instead of having to buy some product that is sponsoring me over and over again.
[56:20.070 --> 56:24.110]  I don't think that's cool. So I do appreciate that. You noticed that, uh,
[56:24.150 --> 56:27.990]  free and entertaining and informative. That's, those are the things I aim to be.
[56:27.990 --> 56:30.870]  So perfect. Awesome. Thank you. Uh, much love to me and the crew.
[56:30.870 --> 56:33.390]  I will share the love with the crew. Hopefully they're all listening right now.
[56:33.390 --> 56:35.750]  So you guys, this dude, tarantula hot gave us mad love.
[56:36.110 --> 56:39.750]  And then give your mom a hug for me. I will do that. And then review it. Yes.
[56:39.750 --> 56:42.150]  You guys review the podcast, go to iTunes and leave a review,
[56:42.150 --> 56:45.070]  just like this guy says. And then also donate a few bucks.
[56:45.590 --> 56:49.470]  Unfortunately PayPal did not like me having a cannabis related podcast linked to
[56:49.470 --> 56:52.310]  their PayPal service. So PayPal has shut me down.
[56:52.590 --> 56:54.590]  I do not have a way to receive donations,
[56:54.590 --> 56:57.790]  but if you'd like to make a contribution to the show, send me an email,
[56:58.070 --> 56:59.950]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[57:00.070 --> 57:02.910]  We will figure out how to receive your contribution.
[57:03.710 --> 57:05.350]  All right. So big shout out to tarantula hockey.
[57:05.350 --> 57:08.870]  He gave us a five star rating and wrote a super, super sweet comment.
[57:08.870 --> 57:13.110]  I appreciate that. Our next comment comes from 100% Clint.
[57:13.110 --> 57:15.630]  And I don't know if that's Clint that's been on the show or if that's just a
[57:15.630 --> 57:19.870]  listener, but they gave us a five star review and they left a comment on May 20th
[57:19.870 --> 57:23.550]  of 2016. And it simply says, give your mom a hug for me.
[57:23.790 --> 57:26.350]  So next time I see my mom, I owe her two hugs.
[57:26.590 --> 57:28.470]  And I want you guys to do the same next time you see your mom,
[57:28.510 --> 57:30.710]  just give her a hug for me. Tell her Rasta Jeff says, hello,
[57:31.230 --> 57:33.550]  she knows who I am. Trust me. All right, you guys,
[57:33.550 --> 57:37.710]  that was the iTunes comments. I want to thank everybody that sent a comment.
[57:37.710 --> 57:40.870]  I encourage you to go to iTunes. Like I said, and post a little comment,
[57:40.870 --> 57:42.830]  post a review. I would truly appreciate it.
[57:42.830 --> 57:44.950]  If you've got something you'd like to say and you don't want to do it on the
[57:44.950 --> 57:47.030]  iTunes comments, you can always send me an email.
[57:47.030 --> 57:50.510]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com. And of course I am on all of the social
[57:50.510 --> 57:54.470]  media. I'm on Facebook. I'm on Instagram. I'm on Twitter. I'm on Snapchat.
[57:54.750 --> 57:56.950]  Find me support all of those. I would appreciate that.
[57:57.790 --> 57:59.870]  And speaking of social media, a couple of days ago,
[57:59.870 --> 58:03.630]  I saw a post from my friend, Nicole West. Big shout out to Nicole. Nicole is,
[58:03.630 --> 58:07.590]  um, she's well established in the cannabis industry. Let's just say that. Uh,
[58:07.590 --> 58:10.310]  she posted something to Facebook that I thought I would share with you guys.
[58:10.630 --> 58:14.390]  It says, dear people applying for jobs in the cannabis industry,
[58:14.550 --> 58:18.310]  just a few tips and I can support everything she says here. Tip number one,
[58:18.670 --> 58:21.310]  please do not make the first sentence of your intro email be.
[58:21.350 --> 58:26.030]  I can pass a drug test. That should be self explanatory. You guys, number two,
[58:26.310 --> 58:29.630]  if you failed at attaching the correct document or attaching the document
[58:29.630 --> 58:31.070]  correctly the first three times,
[58:31.270 --> 58:34.550]  I don't think the fourth time is going to get you your job guys.
[58:34.550 --> 58:38.710]  When you're going to attach, when you send in your resume to work at a dispensary,
[58:38.710 --> 58:42.390]  you need to include a copy of your badge and probably a copy of your ID and
[58:42.390 --> 58:45.870]  there will probably be more documents attached. That shit. Don't forget.
[58:45.950 --> 58:49.430]  Let's have your resume. Don't forget. Send it right the first time. Also,
[58:49.430 --> 58:53.350]  you guys, I heard a friend talking about this. A friend of mine got an email.
[58:54.030 --> 58:57.630]  That was addressed to the wrong person. My friend's name is Lee.
[58:57.630 --> 59:01.150]  The email said, Hey Brian, this indicates to me and Lee,
[59:01.590 --> 59:04.830]  that this email was a mass email sent to multiple people and all the person was
[59:04.830 --> 59:08.230]  doing was going and changing the name is who the letter was addressed to.
[59:08.630 --> 59:10.190]  You guys make sure you change that shit.
[59:10.190 --> 59:13.670]  If you're sending an application or a resume, don't say dear,
[59:13.670 --> 59:15.790]  live well when you're trying to work for the clinic,
[59:15.950 --> 59:18.310]  make sure you get that shit correct. So number three,
[59:18.590 --> 59:22.830]  do not ask me to how to get a badge in your intro email. That's the truth.
[59:22.830 --> 59:23.950]  If you're applying for a job,
[59:23.950 --> 59:27.710]  do not ask the person giving you the job, how to get your badge. That's on you.
[59:28.070 --> 59:30.190]  I've done a whole episode on how to get your badge.
[59:30.550 --> 59:33.870]  Go back and listen to that. That'll truly help you out. Number four,
[59:34.190 --> 59:37.270]  please do not spend the entire interview talking about how shitty the last
[59:37.270 --> 59:41.110]  dispensary you worked for treated everyone. Don't do that. You guys,
[59:41.110 --> 59:43.350]  if you work for another dispensary and you're trying to work for ours,
[59:43.350 --> 59:45.270]  we don't want to hear about the problems at the old place.
[59:45.710 --> 59:46.750]  That means that you're dramatic.
[59:46.790 --> 59:50.190]  That means that you're going to bring some bullshit to our place that we simply
[59:50.190 --> 59:53.150]  do not need. So keep your drama at home, especially during an interview.
[59:54.190 --> 59:56.950]  Number five, no basic weights and measurements.
[59:57.350 --> 01:00:00.550]  If you're coming to work at a dispensary, no, what an eighth weighs,
[01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:03.910]  no, what a quarter weighs, no, what a half ounce weighs,
[01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:07.390]  no, what an ounce weighs. No, this shit, no, it well,
[01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:10.550]  start understanding weights. You need to be quick. You need,
[01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:12.030]  you should be able to eyeball an eighth.
[01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:14.190]  You should be able to throw an eighth on the scale just by grabbing it and
[01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:18.590]  tossing it on there. Get good at that shit. You guys, 3.5 grams is an eighth.
[01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:22.710]  There are 28.35 grams in an ounce. That 0.35 does matter.
[01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:26.910]  Most people skip the 28.35 28.35 is a true ounce you guys.
[01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:31.550]  So do your math from there. All right. Uh, then number six,
[01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:33.310]  regardless of the job you're applying for,
[01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:36.190]  always dress professional at interviews.
[01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:38.190]  Even if you're coming in to be a trimmer,
[01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:41.190]  even if you're coming in just to be an entry level person at a dispensary,
[01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:43.870]  look good. You need to look presentable.
[01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:47.150]  You will be around products that people are going to buy and consume.
[01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:50.950]  People don't want scuzzy people hovering over their cake or their baked goods.
[01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:53.790]  You don't want scuzzy people hovering over the medicine that you're going to
[01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:57.150]  smoke, especially in a medical dispensary. We need clean people.
[01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:58.430]  We need a clean environment.
[01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:02.030]  So you guys those were a few tips that my friend Nicole posted to Facebook.
[01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:04.430]  I thought it would be really helpful to share this. Uh,
[01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:07.510]  it's kind of a smart ass stab at the people trying to get a job,
[01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:09.910]  but it's so real that it was worth sharing.
[01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:11.710]  So she meant to post something smart ass.
[01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:14.550]  I took it seriously because some people need some help with this.
[01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:16.670]  I thought it would be helpful. So big shout out to Nicole West.
[01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:19.030]  You guys, my throat is getting dry as shit.
[01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:21.230]  So this is the point in the show where I'm going to press pause,
[01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.950]  take a couple of dabs and take a drink and I will be right back.
[01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:28.230]  I'm back and I have dabbed the fuck out. You guys,
[01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:31.790]  I need to give a huge shout out to my friends at elevate glass at five 17 South
[01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:34.590]  Tahon and beautiful downtown Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:37.630]  Make sure you check out elevate glass. If you need a new rig,
[01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:40.190]  if you need a new nail, if you need some smoking accessories,
[01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:43.670]  I highly recommend elevate glass. Go check them out. Also,
[01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:45.950]  one more important thing I need to mention, you guys, I've said this before.
[01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:48.790]  I need to remind you again, politely, kindly. I'm not mad at you.
[01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:53.750]  But I cannot ship anybody any seeds at this time. I do not send seeds.
[01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:55.310]  If you're looking for seeds,
[01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:59.430]  I can recommend that you search the internet for the dank team.com.
[01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:03.430]  The D a N K team, dank team.com. Check them out.
[01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:07.750]  They may be able to help you out, but I certainly cannot get you any seeds.
[01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:09.630]  All right, you guys, that's enough business.
[01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:13.230]  Let's get to an email that I received. This one came from our friend,
[01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.270]  Seb shout out to Rasta, Seb down there in Australia.
[01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:17.910]  Thank you for listening to the show. Thank you for supporting the show.
[01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:21.470]  Thank you for being the coolest Facebook troll ever. Thanks for hanging out.
[01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:24.070]  It feels like we're bros. It feels like we've sat around and smoke together.
[01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:27.830]  I've never met the dude in person, but he is family now. So big shout out to Seb.
[01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:30.390]  Cool ass dude. Make sure you follow Rasta, Seb on Facebook.
[01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.470]  Let him know that you found out about him through the grow from your heart
[01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:35.590]  podcast. He's a cool ass dude. He makes some really funny memes.
[01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:38.950]  Sometimes I act like I don't see them because I don't even know what the fuck
[01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:42.470]  to say. So he sent me a long Facebook message with several questions.
[01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:46.910]  I'm going to go through a couple of them here. The first one, he says,
[01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:51.910]  how can a humble, simple ganja farmer folk avoid buying an RO and get rid of
[01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:52.750]  chloramides?
[01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:58.110]  He's asking how he can get rid of the chlorine and whatever else the water
[01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:00.550]  company is putting in your water, uh,
[01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:02.630]  without buying a reverse osmosis machine,
[01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:05.430]  because those are quite expensive and sometimes people can't afford that.
[01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:07.310]  Sometimes you don't have where to anywhere to put it.
[01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:10.270]  So how can a simple ganja farmer, uh,
[01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:13.790]  get rid of the chlorine and the stuff that the city is putting in our, uh,
[01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:16.190]  municipal water? Uh, quite simply,
[01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:19.950]  you can put it in a giant jug and set it in the sun and the sun will help
[01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:23.870]  evaporate off any of those contaminants. Also, I recommend putting,
[01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:26.870]  if you need to do it indoors, if you have to do it indoors, most of us have to,
[01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:29.510]  uh, put the water, put the tap water in a reservoir,
[01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:32.830]  whatever size you're using and put a lot of air stones in there,
[01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:36.310]  put air stones in there and make it bubble real heavily because then you'll move
[01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:40.150]  all that water around and surface area, excuse me for clearing my throat over and
[01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.710]  over again, but surface area is what you're trying to create.
[01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:45.230]  So you want to bring some of that water from the bottom up to the top and help
[01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:47.790]  move some of that chlorine that's trapped in there up to the top and then it
[01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:48.630]  can evaporate.
[01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:53.550]  So the easiest way is just to put your water in a big container and put air
[01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:55.430]  stones in it and bubble the shit out of it. Get your night,
[01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:59.190]  yourself a nice air air bubbler. What do they call it? An air pump. Uh,
[01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:00.670]  just get yourself a nice powerful one.
[01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:03.230]  They make one that's got like eight air things coming off of it,
[01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:07.350]  but all eight of them in like a 30 gallon trash can and fill that sucker with
[01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:09.750]  water and just pump the shit out of the air into there.
[01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:12.430]  And that'll get rid of the chlorine or the chloramide or whatever you're
[01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:15.710]  worried about in there. We'll get rid of most of it. And then of course,
[01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:18.070]  before you give that to your plants, make sure you adjust the pH,
[01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:20.990]  check the pH of that, adjust it before you feed it to your plants.
[01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:23.990]  Depending on the plant's age, their pH, they will want different stuff.
[01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.310]  So that's how you can get rid of that stuff.
[01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:28.390]  And it's free and it doesn't take much, but time and a little bit of energy.
[01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:31.590]  You may have to go buy yourself an air pump. Uh,
[01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:34.950]  the second question Seb asked is thoughts on mycorrhiza and trichoderma
[01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:39.670]  bacteria beneficials. Do you use and how much? Um,
[01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:44.230]  so he wants to know which of these beneficials I use and how much there are
[01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:47.950]  several brands out there. They're mostly the same. You guys, um, I lie.
[01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:51.510]  There are several brands that I like. I really like great white shark. Uh,
[01:04:51.550 --> 01:04:54.750]  sometimes I like OG bio war. I like a lot of different things.
[01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:59.750]  The chunkier white ones seem to work the best for me. Um, how much a whole bunch.
[01:05:00.350 --> 01:05:03.950]  Uh, when I put my, when my seedlings come or when my clones come out of the
[01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:07.110]  cloner, they're going into a cup of soil or a small pot of soil.
[01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:10.310]  I like to sprinkle a little bit of the great white shark around the base area
[01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:13.670]  where the roots are going to hit and then put, or also, uh,
[01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:16.350]  I can't forget this one dragonfly earth medicine.
[01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:19.430]  They make a lush roots is also a great product for this. Uh,
[01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:21.670]  dust the roots in there or put a little, uh,
[01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:23.950]  right where the roots are going to go and then bury the plant into that.
[01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:24.910]  And then when I,
[01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:28.590]  I let the roots grow in that cup or a small container for a long time until it's
[01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:31.230]  almost too much. And then I transplant it into the next container.
[01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:34.470]  And as I do, I'll coat right where I'm going to put the plant.
[01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:37.510]  I'll coat that area with just a sprinkle of whatever, uh,
[01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:40.710]  powdered root inoculant sort of thing that I'm going to use.
[01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:44.230]  If it's great white shark, if it's OG bio war, uh,
[01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:46.550]  whichever brand you're using, you can use OGT.
[01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:49.590]  They're a whole bunch of different products. They're mostly the same. Uh,
[01:05:49.590 --> 01:05:52.190]  I really liked the great white shark. It's affordable. It's cost-effective.
[01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:54.590]  OG bio war is affordable. It's cost-effective.
[01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:56.310]  It's worth its weight in gold, in my opinion.
[01:05:56.630 --> 01:06:00.310]  So those would be the two I'd recommend the great white shark or the OG bio war.
[01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:01.590]  And you can't use too much.
[01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:04.670]  Use it when you go from the cloner into the cup.
[01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:06.270]  And then when you go from the cup into the pot,
[01:06:06.270 --> 01:06:10.150]  and then if you go into another pot, do it again, every time, uh,
[01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:12.070]  right where you're putting those roots, the fresh roots,
[01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:14.670]  just put some of that into the dirt, right where those roots are going to touch.
[01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:18.310]  And then I like to fill a container with clean water.
[01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:21.990]  And then I just mix the powdered solution into the water with my nutrients and
[01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:24.870]  feed it to the plants, just like a water feed,
[01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:26.430]  just like a feed all my other nutrients.
[01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:28.350]  And I feel that that helps soak it in there real good.
[01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:31.230]  So now I've got some that was in there with the roots.
[01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:33.150]  When I put it in there in the dirt, it's already touching it.
[01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:34.030]  The roots are eating it.
[01:06:34.310 --> 01:06:37.110]  And then I feed some in kind of like a tea so that it can get more.
[01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:41.630]  I really like to give it that sort of stuff. Give it all, give it, excuse me.
[01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:45.110]  Once again, give it, uh, give it these things all through the veg phase,
[01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:49.590]  like maybe once every other week through the veg phase and then do it.
[01:06:50.030 --> 01:06:50.350]  Uh,
[01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:54.710]  the first three weeks in flower would not be a bad idea at all because you want
[01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:58.110]  to build those roots and keep those roots moving. So, uh,
[01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:59.950]  I hope that answers your question, dude, which, uh,
[01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:05.150]  which beneficials do I recommend? So the next question,
[01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:08.390]  you said my thoughts on led lights, the benefits you're thinking,
[01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:11.910]  better trichome production, maybe if used in conjunction with HBS,
[01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:16.230]  not to mention energy savings, 10 to one for similar lumens output.
[01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:19.510]  I've seen a lot of great shit come from led lights.
[01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:22.150]  I don't have any experience with them. Honestly,
[01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:25.270]  they're expensive and I'm afraid to invest in a light.
[01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:29.230]  That's not going to make my plants perform the way that they need. Um,
[01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:30.630]  in the right situation,
[01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:34.990]  if you're in a small area and you can't run a big light, do it. Uh,
[01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:37.510]  if what you're able to do is run an led, run an led.
[01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:40.990]  My friend Amanda has an led and I've seen pictures of her cannabis plants and
[01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:45.750]  they look good. Um, I can't argue with the led. My friend, Nancy Budwell,
[01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.590]  I don't know if she listens to this podcast, but shout out to Nancy.
[01:07:48.590 --> 01:07:52.070]  She grows with a lush led and her plants look fucking stellar.
[01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:54.910]  Her plants look really, really good. She does a great job.
[01:07:55.110 --> 01:07:58.350]  I've seen a lot of great stuff from leds. I just don't have any experience.
[01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:03.350]  You are totally accurate with the cost effectiveness of leds.
[01:08:03.350 --> 01:08:07.350]  They really do keep electricity costs down. The lights themselves don't pull as
[01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:09.390]  much power, which means they don't make as much heat,
[01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:12.350]  which means you don't need as much air conditioning. Uh,
[01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:16.310]  so it's really beneficial. It is a good thing. Uh, if you get the right leds,
[01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:20.110]  I'm sure that there are some cheap China made ones out there that you wouldn't
[01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:23.710]  want to purchase. I'm sure there are some great American made leds that would
[01:08:23.710 --> 01:08:27.630]  work very well. So just do your research. If you're going to buy an led,
[01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:30.150]  I guess that's the best I could say on their tricone production. Yeah.
[01:08:30.150 --> 01:08:32.750]  It's going to help you out with tricone production because you're getting more
[01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:33.590]  types of light.
[01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.790]  It's going to make the plants grow a little bit differently also.
[01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:40.670]  It's going to change the gosh, I'm sorry you guys, I'm just choking up over here.
[01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:44.670]  It's going to change the nutritive cycle of that plant a little bit.
[01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:45.830]  It's going to speed it up a little bit.
[01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:47.750]  I feel like cause it's getting more different light.
[01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:50.270]  So you're going to probably need to feed a little bit differently.
[01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:54.830]  There'll be adjustments to be made if you shift shift from an HPS to an led or
[01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:57.430]  if you add an led to your HPS room,
[01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:59.590]  you're going to see different shit happening that you're going to have to
[01:08:59.590 --> 01:09:04.310]  adjust to. I saw sub cool hang a lush led in his HPS room,
[01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:08.070]  and the plant underneath it hated it. But, uh,
[01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:10.030]  that's just cause it wasn't sub cools grow style.
[01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:11.270]  So you're going to have to adjust some shit.
[01:09:12.150 --> 01:09:14.510]  I hope that answered your question about leds in my opinion.
[01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:19.830]  So the next one is why I want to ask why more commercial grows don't get
[01:09:19.830 --> 01:09:23.670]  solar to offset massive power costs. Honestly,
[01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:25.990]  at the amount of electricity we're using,
[01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:29.870]  I don't know that solar would even be a viable source.
[01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:31.790]  I honestly don't know enough about solar.
[01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:35.870]  That's something I would have to research, but honestly I, we pull,
[01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:40.670]  we've got 85, 1000 watt lights in one room and 25,
[01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:45.350]  1000 watt lights in another room. Uh, the electricity bill is high, dude.
[01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:48.710]  And we've also got, um, shit,
[01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:52.190]  tons, tons and tons of air conditioning on top of that building.
[01:09:52.190 --> 01:09:55.830]  They just keep us cool all day. Uh, it was really warm today.
[01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:58.350]  Well, not really warm. It was fairly warm today outside.
[01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:59.230]  It's going to get way hotter,
[01:09:59.230 --> 01:10:02.350]  but it was fairly warm and the building was nice and cool.
[01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:04.150]  It was probably 74 degrees in the whole building.
[01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:06.390]  And we've got a nice office space. We've got a trim area.
[01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:09.750]  So there's a shit ton of lights. Uh, I don't think, wow,
[01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:11.030]  that motorcycle was so loud.
[01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:13.590]  I hope you guys heard that cause it kind of scared the shit out of me. Uh,
[01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:17.790]  I don't think that we could get enough electricity through solar, uh,
[01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:19.390]  to run all of the stuff that we have.
[01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:24.630]  Of course I am not an electrical engineer or anywhere educated in any means of
[01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:27.110]  solar power, but that's my opinion. That's what I would assume.
[01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:30.390]  That's what I would guess, dude. Uh, so then he asked me question number five,
[01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:34.390]  said, said, how do you keep so cool under pressure when the cop pulled you over?
[01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:35.630]  And then he also said,
[01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:38.470]  being responsible for so much medicine and patience as it does,
[01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:41.310]  it keep you awake at night, worrying about timers and stuff.
[01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:44.790]  Any tips on how to relax and not freak out like I tend to?
[01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:50.790]  Well, shit, bro. I didn't worry about timers and stuff until you just pointed it out.
[01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:53.830]  Now I'm having a damn panic attack and I want to check the cameras on my phone
[01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:56.350]  and see if everything at the grow is cool. And I'm just kidding.
[01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:58.150]  I'm just totally joking with you. Um,
[01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:02.070]  how do I keep my cool under pressure? Like when that cop pulled me over? Well,
[01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:05.870]  I'm a grown ass adult and that cop's just a grown ass man with a job to do.
[01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:07.830]  And I didn't have anything to hide.
[01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:13.150]  And I guess being a white dude with a nice car probably helped me out.
[01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:17.110]  So I didn't feel like I was worried about too much. And cause I mean,
[01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:20.150]  we know I'm not even kidding. If I was a different race,
[01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:21.630]  it could have been a totally different outcome.
[01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:24.270]  I'm not accusing this cop of anything, but we know how things go.
[01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:26.550]  So being a spoiled white dude helps me out for sure.
[01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:29.070]  In that case, keeping my cool with the cops. Uh,
[01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:33.710]  and I'm just well educated and I speak well and I'm very sociable.
[01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:36.190]  So I don't worry about cops. They're just people with a job to do.
[01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:38.950]  And if you're not doing anything stupid and hiding anything,
[01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:42.830]  most of the time you should be cool. I feel like. And so I just,
[01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:47.230]  I hoped for that. I guess that's how I stayed cool with the cops. Honestly,
[01:11:47.230 --> 01:11:49.990]  I'm not intimidated by people, people or people. Uh,
[01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:54.630]  if the person next to me is Rasta, Seb, if the person next to me is white,
[01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:57.030]  Mike, if the person sitting next to me is Lindsey,
[01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:59.510]  or if the person sitting next to me is the president,
[01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:04.230]  or if the person sitting next to me is whoever, uh, I feel the same.
[01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:06.910]  They're people. We're all humans. We all fart. We all poop.
[01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:09.870]  We all have to go pee. Uh, we all need to eat food to live life.
[01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:11.550]  We all have feelings. We're all just people. So I don't,
[01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:14.790]  people don't make me nervous. Like we're all just people like rock stars,
[01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:17.710]  or just people that play guitars real well. I don't get nervous around people.
[01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:20.110]  So that's how I keep cool in that situation. Uh,
[01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:24.350]  the part about being responsible for so much medicine and patients.
[01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:26.870]  And does it keep me awake at night? Uh, no,
[01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:28.950]  because I wouldn't be in the position.
[01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:32.230]  If the people that put me that let me have this position,
[01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:36.190]  didn't have full trust of me. And I would not, um,
[01:12:36.230 --> 01:12:38.790]  I wouldn't even do it if I didn't have faith in myself, but I could do this.
[01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:41.270]  I would say straight up like, Hey, this is not my thing.
[01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:45.350]  I can't handle this. And also I've got good backup. It is my,
[01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:49.190]  I do run that grow by myself for the most part, but if I need help,
[01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:52.710]  I can call hunt. Hunt will come help. I can call Zach. Zach will come help.
[01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:56.190]  I have a trimmer that's there trimming, uh, eight days a week now.
[01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:59.910]  So I can have him help me if there is trouble in the grow that I need help with.
[01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:03.550]  So yeah, I am responsible for it, but it doesn't keep me awake at night. Uh,
[01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:05.990]  I've got it figured out. I know the building really well.
[01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:09.710]  I know every timer in the building. I know what time everything clicks on,
[01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:10.950]  what time everything clicks off.
[01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:13.470]  I know what the temperature is in each room right now.
[01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:17.950]  So I don't worry too much about that. Uh, then you said,
[01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:22.230]  does it keep you awake at night worrying about timers and stuff? Uh,
[01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:25.150]  so one time, dude, uh, it was late,
[01:13:25.150 --> 01:13:28.350]  it was midnight and I was laying down to go to sleep and I thought I should
[01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:30.830]  check the cameras at the grow just to see what's going on.
[01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:33.750]  And it's an hour away from my house, uh, in good weather.
[01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:38.190]  So I look at the camera and I can see that this one pump has broken.
[01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:42.430]  I can see it on the camera that a tank that should have been fed to these
[01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:46.710]  plants was totally full and the pump had not pumped in several hours,
[01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:48.710]  probably six good hours.
[01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:53.070]  And if these plants didn't get a drink of water within the next three or four
[01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:56.670]  hours, it probably were going to die. And it was midnight.
[01:13:56.710 --> 01:13:58.710]  And I was getting ready to go to bed and I saw this.
[01:13:58.790 --> 01:14:00.830]  And so I did the only thing I could do.
[01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:04.830]  I put on my shoes and I got in my car and I drove the hour there and I fixed the
[01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:07.870]  pump. Honestly, it took me maybe five minutes to fix that pump.
[01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:12.070]  Um, then I got back in the car and my car broken down. It wouldn't start.
[01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.230]  I had to, I had to get my car fucking towed home that night.
[01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:16.870]  That was really funny. Cause it was five in the morning by the time I got home.
[01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:19.590]  But, uh, I have cameras.
[01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:22.670]  I can check and see if anything goes really wrong. And at this point,
[01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:26.430]  I've been there long enough to where, uh, I know, like I said earlier,
[01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:30.790]  I know every timer in that building. I know every breaker in the breaker box.
[01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:34.830]  I know where I know every, if I'm, if a leaf moves in that room,
[01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:37.790]  I know which plant it was on. That's how well I know that grow.
[01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:42.270]  So it doesn't stress me out too much. It doesn't keep me up at night. Uh, man,
[01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:45.550]  if you smoked as much hash as I did and smoked as many edibles as I did,
[01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:47.750]  you'd have no problem sleeping at night.
[01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:51.510]  But I just have faith in myself. Honestly, uh,
[01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:53.830]  I've been doing this for a long time. I'm a confident dude.
[01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:56.910]  I take a lot of notes. Honestly, I write notes on everything.
[01:14:56.910 --> 01:15:00.390]  I've got billions of little post-it notes all over the grow. That helps me out.
[01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:03.270]  That honestly helps me keep my cool because, um,
[01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:05.110]  just all the shit that I need to do is right there.
[01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:07.070]  Once I figure finish a couple of tasks,
[01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:09.350]  I cross them off the list and then throw the post-it note away.
[01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:12.150]  If you give me something that I need to remember, I just write it down.
[01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:14.150]  I just keep posting notes. That really helps me.
[01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:17.070]  That's something that really helps me keep my shit together as notes.
[01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:19.710]  And then I talk notes into my phone. Also, I tell Siri, Hey Siri,
[01:15:19.710 --> 01:15:23.750]  make a note of this and Siri will remind me later. So, uh, that helps me out.
[01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:28.670]  Uh, any tips on not on how to relax and not freak out like you tend to, uh,
[01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:31.750]  just chill out, bro. You got it. Uh, what are you so fucking worried about?
[01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:34.750]  Chill out. You're cool. All of you chill out. You got it.
[01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:37.230]  Whatever you're doing, be confident. You're doing it. You got this.
[01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:42.390]  And you're probably going to fuck up, but that's life. And when you do fix it,
[01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:46.110]  you'll be okay. Like seriously, I run a big ass grow. And, uh,
[01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:47.230]  I was talking to a guy,
[01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:49.350]  we're opening a new facility and I was talking to a guy and he's like,
[01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:51.510]  so what's the first thing you do when you get here? And I said, honestly,
[01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:54.390]  the first thing you do every morning when you walk into a big facility is find
[01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:59.390]  the surprise because I'm going to see twice a week I walk into the grow and
[01:15:59.630 --> 01:16:01.710]  there's a surprise. Uh,
[01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:05.430]  the other day a breaker had flipped and a cloner filled with clones that I
[01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:08.630]  really wanted to have. Uh, the breaker flipped in that corner.
[01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:13.670]  All those clones died because the breaker went out. And today,
[01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:15.710]  um, the building next door to mine,
[01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:19.190]  all of their power went out because of a breaker. It had nothing to do with me,
[01:16:19.190 --> 01:16:22.390]  but I mean, there's always weird shit like that going on in a commercial grow.
[01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:25.670]  There's always going to be surprises. So no matter how hard you do it,
[01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:28.350]  you're going to get some kind of surprise and it's how you deal with that.
[01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:29.830]  So just be ready to deal with some shit.
[01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:33.750]  Don't freak out and have faith in yourself. Just know that you can do it.
[01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:37.830]  You got this far and you're going to fuck up. Like, don't worry,
[01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:39.670]  you're going to fuck up. No matter how old you are,
[01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:42.590]  no matter how much you've done it, you're going to make some mistakes.
[01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:45.990]  No one's going to laugh at you. Maybe we are, but laugh at yourself too.
[01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:49.150]  And if you overflow a reservoir, uh,
[01:16:49.710 --> 01:16:53.190]  get the squeegee and push that water down to the drain and then mop up the
[01:16:53.190 --> 01:16:57.030]  floor. And then next time don't overflow that reservoir. If you kill a plant,
[01:16:57.050 --> 01:16:59.390]  remember what you did. Don't kill a plant again. I don't know.
[01:16:59.390 --> 01:17:01.670]  That's how I stay so I don't freak out about stuff.
[01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:05.230]  I've been at this a long time and I've dealt with a lot of mistakes and a lot of
[01:17:05.230 --> 01:17:05.630]  problems.
[01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:08.870]  And I know that I'm prepared to deal with almost anything you can throw at me in
[01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:12.670]  a grow room. And if I haven't dealt with it yet, uh, I'm ready to learn.
[01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:15.070]  So that's how I don't freak out, bro.
[01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:18.430]  I just stay confident and know that I got this shit. That's life.
[01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:22.230]  Just how it goes. Plants are going to die. Reservoirs are going to overflow.
[01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:25.230]  Things are going to happen. Um, lights are going to fall.
[01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:28.150]  I've seen lights just completely fall. I've seen tables fall over.
[01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:31.950]  Random shit happens. I'm just confident that I can deal with it when it does.
[01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:34.830]  Part of that is cause I have a, I got a little bit of,
[01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:37.630]  a little bit of faith in me and some other things. So it makes me confident.
[01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:40.110]  All right. So I want to give a huge shout out to my buddy, Ross to Seb.
[01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:44.110]  Seb, thank you for five. What'd you send me? Five good questions. Uh,
[01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:46.470]  there were more questions in that message, but, um,
[01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:50.350]  I've been going for 33 minutes now and I feel like most people only stick around
[01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:53.790]  for 36 minutes is what the statistics show. When I look at my, uh,
[01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:57.550]  my stats for my podcast, it looks like he has like a 36 minute episode.
[01:17:57.550 --> 01:18:01.070]  So we're getting close to that, which means I should start wrapping this shit up.
[01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:04.350]  So thanks everybody who listened for this far. Uh,
[01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:07.350]  I do have more emails with more questions. I am getting to those.
[01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:09.630]  If you sent me a message, if you sent me an email,
[01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:11.230]  I will answer your questions. You guys,
[01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:14.510]  I get emails and messages on a lot of different platforms.
[01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:17.270]  So it's hard to find all of them. It would be really cool of you.
[01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:20.430]  If you can send your questions and comments to me through the email,
[01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:23.870]  it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com. I will check that.
[01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:27.070]  And then all the podcast stuff will be right there. I could just look at it and be
[01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:28.510]  like, Oh look, there's Bill's email.
[01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:30.310]  And then I could just read it and it'll be so much easier.
[01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:32.470]  It's cool if you want to send them on Facebook and all that,
[01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:34.950]  but sometimes I lose them and I forget where they are and then I got to go
[01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:37.550]  searching. So I try to take screenshots, honestly,
[01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:39.910]  when I have your email and I want to use it, I screenshot it.
[01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:43.870]  So I got a picture of it, but anyway, uh, send me questions via email.
[01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:46.870]  That would be really rad. Grow from your heart at hotmail.com. Once again,
[01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:50.710]  shout out to our friends at elevate glass five 17 South Tahoe.
[01:18:50.710 --> 01:18:53.590]  And I may have said the wrong address in a previous episode, elevate.
[01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:57.030]  I'm sorry. Smoke a lot of dabs and he gave me a cool rig. Um,
[01:18:57.070 --> 01:19:00.550]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Chris, also known as Bobo blaster.
[01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:03.550]  Co uh, he needs a hug. So I'm going to send it to him.
[01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:05.670]  Big virtual hug to your brother. Can't wait.
[01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:09.990]  So you get back from your little trip. Hope things are well for you. Uh,
[01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:11.670]  also earlier I was talking about the secret says,
[01:19:11.670 --> 01:19:13.110]  shout out to Lindsay for hanging out with me.
[01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:15.950]  Shout out to Molly for hanging out with me and keeping me alive because I may
[01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:19.390]  have taken a nap in that damn chair. If you ladies did not rescue me. All right,
[01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:21.030]  you guys, this is the end of the podcast.
[01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:22.310]  I want to thank everybody for listening.
[01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:25.070]  It'd be really cool if you went to iTunes and do what those other folks did at
[01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:28.950]  the beginning of the show. Go to iTunes, find the iTunes store,
[01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:31.590]  go to the review section. Yeah, that's what you do. Uh,
[01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:34.230]  type in a find the growth from your heart podcast, find the review section,
[01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:37.030]  type in a little comment. Let me know what you think about the podcast.
[01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:40.910]  Type in some stars. Just click on some stars. I would say, give me five,
[01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:43.030]  but that's kind of begging. If you think I only deserve three,
[01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:46.470]  throw me three stars. That's fair. I want to know what you think. Tell the truth.
[01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:50.750]  Uh, so go there, leave a comment, throw me some stars. That'd be cool.
[01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:53.750]  But what would be even cooler is if you told like three or five of your friends
[01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:56.550]  about the podcast, you're like, dude, you should hear this guy's podcast.
[01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:59.390]  It's called grow from your heart. You can listen to it on stitcher.
[01:19:59.390 --> 01:20:03.470]  You can listen to it on iTunes or you can even hear it on talk radio,
[01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:07.630]  talk radio.com on Wednesdays at 1pm or you can even go to his website.
[01:20:07.630 --> 01:20:11.310]  It's I read genetics, Colorado.com and go to the podcast tab and you could
[01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:14.670]  listen to all the episodes there. So tell your friends about that shit, right?
[01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:16.510]  And if you tell like three to five people,
[01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:18.710]  maybe one or two of them will start listening. You know,
[01:20:18.710 --> 01:20:20.950]  that's just how shit is. Not everyone's going to listen. That's cool.
[01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:23.870]  I get it. But tell a lot of people and then a couple of few people listen.
[01:20:24.190 --> 01:20:27.310]  And then more people are going to learn how to grow better cannabis.
[01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:30.870]  And then more people are going to learn about freeing the cannabis plant.
[01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:33.710]  More people are going to learn about the healing properties of cannabis.
[01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:35.390]  And then eventually, you know, it's going to happen.
[01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:38.230]  We're going to legalize cannabis nationwide.
[01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:40.270]  If you'd like to be a sponsor of the podcast,
[01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:41.830]  or if you've got a product you'd like me to review,
[01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:43.390]  all you've got to do is send me an email. Again,
[01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:44.990]  it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:48.830]  I would love to get you all of the information that you need. You guys,
[01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:50.190]  that's all I've got for this week.
[01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:52.230]  I'll be back in seven days with another podcast.
[01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:56.870]  Shout out to my buddy Rasta said big shout out to my ninja spins until next
[01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:59.710]  time. Take a fat dad and give your mom a hug.
[01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:05.270]  I spent a lot of time working on the bottom line mind on the money.
[01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:07.630]  So I guess the money's on my mind. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:21:07.630 --> 01:21:10.750]  Tricks I get a buck for the dollar sign. Even chicks.
[01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:14.470]  I won't fuck with that nine to die. Nope. On top of being good with the look,
[01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:17.150]  I need her in the kitchen, fixing up and cooking the book.
[01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:19.390]  You can buy me in the hood with the crooks.
[01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:24.190]  Getting my feet wet like I stuck my foot in the book to get the money.
[01:21:24.190 --> 01:21:25.310]  I'll be harming your head.
[01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:30.190]  Leaving with your arm and your leg. Everybody's starving for bread.
[01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:32.870]  Here. Try my margarine spread.
[01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:37.630]  I'm still me like Jenny from the block with the piggy bank brain,
[01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:38.990]  bunch of pennies for my thoughts.
[01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:43.310]  Put your Betty in the top and watch me bounce because one thing count
[01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:48.390]  in the bank.
[01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:08.350]  It's all the accounts. But as of late,
[01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:11.670]  what's on my plate. So I can't make ends meet.
[01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:15.110]  All I hear is, can I get you back next week? No.
[01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:19.350]  So give me that check, please. Everybody says I'm nickel and dime.
[01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:23.790]  I don't make it rain. A slight trickle is fine. Oh, if I were a rich man,
[01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:26.470]  then I'd play a little fiddle on the roof.
[01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:31.910]  We raised the stakes. We forced the ante up. Bet your bottom dollar.
[01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:34.590]  I tore her panties up.
[01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:38.430]  Like I tore the envelope to get your birthday card and scored your granny's
[01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:41.310]  bum. Keep your fanny tuck underneath your long shirt.
[01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:43.990]  See me waiting for you outside. When you get off work,
[01:22:44.150 --> 01:22:46.750]  you want to make a living. I want to make a killing.
[01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:48.350]  So put your hands to the sky.
[01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:49.190]  Bitches.
[01:23:11.190 --> 01:23:13.510]  Get your rupees. Get your shackles.
[01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:18.990]  Get your foreign, you know, partner,
[01:23:19.190 --> 01:23:22.470]  partner with each other. Trade.
[01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:25.310]  Now you don't need a bank account.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.880]  Welcome back cannabis community. It's time for episode number one 35,
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.560]  maybe one 36 of the girl from your heart podcast.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:55.880]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.880]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:59.840]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.240]  if you're a cannabis activist or someone who's just curious about the current
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:08.040]  state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host.
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:10.640]  My friends call me Ross to Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.680]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:15.560]  Shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band for letting me use their music
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:19.240]  on my podcast. Big up, big up to the entire mystic roots crew.
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.320]  You guys make sure you catch mystic roots on tour.
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.080]  They're coming through Colorado. It'll be in Boulder, uh, June 5th.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.560]  They'll be in Fort Collins, June 8th.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.720]  They'll be at Cervantes in Denver June 9th. And you know,
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:33.800]  I will be at the black sheep June 11th with ketchup fire. Come see me,
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.520]  take some dads with me. It'll be a good time.
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.920]  I'll turn down the music a little bit because I feel like I'm fucking yelling
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.400]  over it. Sorry about that. Was louder than I realized.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.320]  We're having a party over here. Welcome to the party. Everybody moodsetter,
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:47.760]  moodsetter to the left of me. You guys is the always lovely,
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:50.560]  the traveling stoner, miss Lindsay. How are you tonight? I'm doing good.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.760]  Thanks for joining me. Absolutely. And in front of me is our buddy.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:57.520]  White Mike. Welcome back, bro. Thanks man. How you doing, man? Good, good.
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.600]  Thanks for coming on the show. You guys.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:03.720]  It's a 10 45 here on a lovely Friday evening in Pueblo,
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.880]  Colorado getting them in when we can recording shows when we can.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.800]  The reason I stumbled on the intro number,
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:12.040]  I'm not sure if this is going to be episode one 35 or one 36.
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:17.360]  I recorded an episode with the Colorado podcast boys and it just got out of
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:18.880]  hand. So, uh,
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:23.640]  that one may be used as a bonus episode and not a normal podcast feed episode.
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:27.440]  I almost put it out like on a Thursday or something because there wasn't a whole
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.280]  lot of girl talk.
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.200]  I don't want us to know that would love the fuck out of you for any sort of
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.040]  extra content.
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.720]  That Australian guy was mentioned quite a bit in that episode.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.160]  Hour of shenanigans with those three. It was pure shenanigans.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.440]  I'm not sure which one of us will put it up first. Uh,
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:45.080]  our Aussie friend said we'll listen to it the minute it drops on either one of
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:49.680]  our feeds. So if you guys, I've made my decision. This will be number one 35.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:53.560]  The Colorado podcast mix episode will be number one 36.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:56.480]  We'll put that out on a Thursday. That's how I'm going to do it. Uh,
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:59.400]  I apologize in advance. You guys, that podcast is a mess.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:02.040]  There are some grow talks in there. Um,
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:06.640]  but Jesse got real high and Adam likes to interrupt a lot. So, uh,
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:10.440]  it was hard to have a grow conversation, but it was fun. There was a lot of,
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.880]  a lot of rambles and funness. So join us on one 36. It's a good time. Uh,
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.440]  on this episode, I'm going to give a huge shout out to our friends at elevate
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:20.960]  glass, uh, elevate glass gallery in Colorado Springs. Make sure you check them out.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:24.440]  It's five 17 South Tahoe and beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.280]  Go get yourself a new rig. Go say hello to the lovely ladies.
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.960]  Also the podcast is available now on talkradio.com.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.920]  You can check on the show Wednesdays at one o'clock on talkradio.com.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:38.480]  Big old shout out to my buddy citizen. Jay, thanks for putting me on the network.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:39.200]  Um,
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.640]  I think that's all of the official business that I need to spit out for right now.
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.880]  How are you guys doing? You guys look higher. You're staring at me like, dude,
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:48.840]  thank you for turning down that fucking music.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:52.320]  You've got shown out since so far, the topics is secret,
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.920]  but I'm way too big to read upside down.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:54.840]  I don't know about a secret.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:57.760]  I just got an email that I wanted to read and I'm sure that you'll have a couple
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:01.080]  of things to chime in with because yeah, yeah, always.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:04.600]  And Lindsay always has good shit to say. She brings up good points that I overlook.
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.280]  So, uh, let's just jump right into it.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:08.680]  We've got an email that's part of the topic of the show. Uh,
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:12.840]  this one comes from our friend. Does he want me to say his name or not? Uh,
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:15.080]  I'm not going to say his name because he's from an illegal state.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.360]  It says that he lives in an illegal state. He says, hi,
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.200]  my name is something and I live in an illegal state.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:22.800]  And I was wondering if you could do an episode about how to control fungus gnats.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:27.680]  I know how to control fungus gnats. That's not too hard of a problem. Uh,
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:32.040]  do you have a good method? I don't have a great method. Okay. Um, my,
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.800]  my one and only bug solution, um,
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:39.400]  that I ever had the power to implement and really carry out to my own desire is
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.880]  sort of, um, uh, nuclear.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:45.360]  Nuclear. Um, it's the one time you got bugs.
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:49.680]  The one time I got bugs, I got spider-minded bad. Um, I remember that. I just,
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:51.200]  I went to town. Um,
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:54.280]  it's a month long process that involves a couple of gallons of bleach and
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:58.840]  killing everything you own. Um, plant wise, it takes a long,
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:03.520]  it works as a, as a one. I don't have that option. No, a lot of people,
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:06.760]  I cannot do that. So, um, a lot of people have to fight,
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:09.240]  but no fungus gnats was never one I really had to play with.
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:12.560]  Well, this dude's asking about fungus gnats, uh, fungus gnats occur.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:15.640]  They show up when your soil is kept too moist or when your medium is kept too
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:18.920]  moist. Uh, I'm growing at a giant commercial warehouse.
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.040]  And in that warehouse we've got a giant floor drain.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.680]  And oftentimes I see little fucking fungus gnats trying to fly up through that
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:25.920]  floor drain. I can get rid of every bug.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.160]  They transfer. Yeah, good. I know that. And, uh,
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.040]  those are the peat moss traveling. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:35.240]  They come in soil all the time. You buy bags of soil and they're in there.
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:37.600]  So I've helped people fight these infestations.
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.400]  If you can keep moisture levels down a little bit in your soil,
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.720]  let your dirt dry up a little bit. Uh, that'll help get rid of them. Uh,
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:45.640]  you can use diatomaceous earth on top,
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.640]  let the soil dry applied diatomaceous earth to the top of the soil or the medium.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.840]  If you got cocoa and just leave it on their wall to dry and then water a little
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:56.840]  later, you got to put that shit on their wall. It's dry. It works when it's dry.
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.200]  Then those bugs won't want to climb in there.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:02.880]  What I recommend if you're trying to stay all organic,
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:06.880]  there are little things at Lowe's or home Depot called mosquito dunks.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:09.760]  They're just little donut looking things in a red package. Uh,
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:11.800]  put those in the water, submerge them in the water,
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:14.720]  let them sit there for a little while. They'll kind of get mushy, uh,
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:17.640]  wear a rubber glove and rub them in your hand and grind them up a little bit to
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.720]  where they turn into a powder and let that sit in your reservoir and put a
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.480]  little bit of that in each plant. When you water,
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.720]  that's a beneficial bacteria that I cannot remember the name of right now.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.120]  I know it, but since I'm trying to tell you, it's gone out of my mind. Uh,
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:32.800]  but that beneficial bacteria will kill off the fungus gnats and it's cheap,
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.960]  effective and organic in a home grow. If you're doing a big grow, uh,
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:39.000]  you may need a product like natural and you do the exact same process.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.400]  You just feed that into the soil.
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:44.760]  And then you're going to want to triple check that against your state's list if
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:48.800]  your state's gotten that far, but this is a home grow letter in it. Yeah,
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.360]  this is a home grow guy in an illegal state. But if you're going to the,
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:55.800]  the mosquito dunk solution is not a bad one. Um, but I mean,
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:59.920]  honestly the go back and listen to the episodes about, um,
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:03.920]  ways of maintaining your garden to really prevent infestations from occurring
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:05.440]  unfortunately with fungus gnats.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:08.520]  A lot of times people bring them home from the gross floor. Yeah.
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:11.960]  They come in the soil quite often. I've had thrips come in soil. Uh,
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.480]  I can't say that I've had spider mites come in.
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:16.120]  So I've helped deal with this.
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:21.160]  One of them got them when the guy that lived in the other side of the split
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:26.480]  level, um, started to grow. Oh yeah. Two separate grows in one domicile.
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:28.560]  Yeah. That's dangerous.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.640]  The dude that started the second little fun and fun closet grow, um,
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.400]  brought home fungus nets in his soil. Um, cost the other,
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:39.960]  the guy growing on the other side of the grow, um, immensely.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.360]  And then the other person I know that got them that,
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:44.160]  that neighbor on the other side of the fence,
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:47.600]  or the other side of the alley rather, um,
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:51.200]  we couldn't figure out where they came from. It didn't make any sense. Um,
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:54.760]  just kind of wandered in and found the plant and went nuts was our best guess.
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:57.280]  And then we heard them harvesting. Um,
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:00.040]  and they were bitching about all the little white bugs flying out of the bud.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.120]  And we were like, well, that's where they came from.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:08.160]  And we can't retaliate or say anything right now because we don't want them to
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:12.120]  know we had plants back here. Um,
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:13.600]  they thought their weed smelled good.
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:21.840]  But yeah, that was, uh, um, neither of those were under my care,
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:25.320]  but in both of them were like really hard to prevent type situations.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:27.320]  The way to get rid of fungus nets,
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:30.640]  I think is either the dunks or natural and dry out your soil.
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.040]  You can always use, um, as a max, as a soil drench, use it really lightly,
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.520]  mix it in with water. I do not know the ratio. Uh,
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.760]  it says on the container as a soil dredge. So pour,
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.960]  pour a little bit as a max into your, uh,
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.520]  into some water and just water the plants with that.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.960]  And that'll help you out with fungus nets.
[01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:50.400]  I wouldn't go that route unless it's extreme, but it will work. Uh,
[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:52.760]  unless your plants are really healthy. I don't know that I would do it,
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:53.400]  but it'll work.
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:56.760]  It sounds like you're at least headed to Lowe's or the local hydroponics.
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.720]  Go to Lowe's and try and, um,
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:02.280]  so put the mosquito dunks in there and water. And then if you have the time,
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:07.240]  depending on how big your plants are, um, cover up the soil, uh, cover up the,
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:07.560]  like,
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:10.760]  if you can maybe take a paper plate and cut a slit up it and then put that,
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:13.040]  put the stem in that slit and then cover up the soil.
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.320]  So the bugs don't have a way in or out.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:17.280]  Then the bugs that are in there will stand there and die.
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:19.840]  No more bugs will be able to land in there. They won't be breeding.
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:21.040]  That'll help you keep more shit out too.
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.960]  So the paper plate method will be totally helpful.
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:25.280]  Diatonaceous earth if you want to go hard on it,
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:28.720]  but I think the mosquito dunks are some natural will solve your problem. All
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:31.360]  right. Part two of this email, this dude says, also,
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:34.800]  could you speak about the laws in Pueblo, Colorado for growing your own medicine,
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.480]  maybe about four to six plants? And then he says, thank you.
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:41.880]  I love the show and enjoy all of the educational, goddamn, excuse that.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:45.920]  All of the educational information you give a dude. Thanks for listening.
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.280]  I appreciate it. Thanks for the email.
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:50.960]  I'm going to let Mike talk a little bit about growing laws in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:54.840]  Okay. So the city and the County of Pueblo are two different legal entities.
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:57.400]  It was a nickel actually.
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.080]  You so Poe, you dropping nickels.
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:08.120]  So the city and County both have slightly different rules for four to six plants
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:09.640]  though, in all of Colorado,
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:14.800]  any adult can legally grow six plants just because amendment 64
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.240]  passed in marijuana is legal here.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:22.120]  So as long as you keep no more than three plants per adult in the household
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:26.840]  in flower and then say you were living inside city limits.
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:30.640]  You kept those no more than three plants in flower.
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:34.760]  And then your three veg plants and no more than a hundred square foot,
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:39.400]  uh, grow space 10 by 10. Um, you'd pretty much be covered. Um,
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:44.080]  that's a pretty small growth space. Um, they wanted to make it a lot smaller.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:46.920]  Um, and then they wanted to fight for it. Yeah.
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:49.880]  And they wanted to live in your plant count and basically me and one other
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:53.560]  citizen, um, who, who does not like his name being shared publicly,
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:57.480]  but you know who you are. Um, thank you for the help with that fight.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.240]  Does he listen to me? I have no idea. Okay.
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:05.920]  I was just recently at his house and he does amazing work. Um,
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:10.040]  but uh, yeah. So when the city, you can,
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.200]  you just got to keep your grow restricted to the total square footage, um,
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:18.120]  under a hundred square feet, which is 10 by 10 or, uh,
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:23.320]  in the county it's, uh, there's, there's a square foot limit, I think overall,
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.360]  but it's pretty big. Um, and then there's a plant count.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.880]  That's a total per household.
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:32.840]  But if you're talking about just growing your own six legal plants under
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:37.120]  amendment 64 for say you and a domestic partner,
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:41.640]  um, that would be 12 plants total. You're under the, under the limit. Um,
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.440]  and honestly,
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:46.720]  before you started your grow in either of those locations,
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:49.960]  I would recommend heading to the appropriate zoning department cause there
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.680]  are two of them. Um,
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.520]  and just asking politely for a copy of the home grow rules,
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.160]  which they're happy to give you or tell you how to find, um,
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:00.640]  so that you can go home and follow them. Um,
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.880]  and right now there's a bunch of raids going on right now. Um,
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:06.800]  people that moved here didn't read the rules. Um,
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.120]  a couple of them are quite quoted as going, yeah,
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:12.640]  come in and look like it's legal here, right? Like, yeah,
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:16.000]  but there's rules and you ain't following. So you go into jail,
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:20.240]  just like you would in Texas or Florida for the same crimes with the same
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:25.160]  penalties. Um, but we, it's legal here. It's a weird conundrum. Yeah.
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:28.680]  But the rules are easy to follow, especially if you're looking for personal,
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:31.840]  um, personal harvest sizes. Um,
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:34.600]  you can play with your numbers and your growth space and stuff and kind of
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:38.680]  maximize that. But, um, for a small grow four to six plants,
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.320]  it's super easy to follow the rules.
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:43.640]  Some counties have made different grow, uh, plant count limits.
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.960]  Some counties don't have any plant count limits.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:50.360]  That changes in every legal jurisdiction in Pueblo. And if, uh, in Colorado,
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:53.480]  or in Colorado, I'm sorry. When you go to the medical marijuana doctor,
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:58.440]  you can ask them to possibly recommend more plants so that you can
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:02.680]  have more medicine and they'll write you an extended plant count if you qualify.
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:06.400]  And then in some counties you're able to grow however many your card says,
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:10.680]  a lot of counties have limited you a lot. Just let you do your thing. Um, yeah,
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:14.040]  more and more counties and cities, towns, everything, uh,
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.680]  every little jurisdiction in Colorado,
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:20.320]  they're starting to pass rules limiting the total size of a home cultivation.
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:21.880]  Um, basically,
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:26.720]  unless you own property where you could grow acres and acres of corn, um,
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:30.960]  within the next year or two expect that that area will have passed a limit of at
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:36.040]  least 20 plants or maybe 200 or 300 square feet, um,
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:39.960]  total grow space in a private, private residence in Colorado. That's,
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.280]  I think that's pretty, a pretty fair bet.
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:45.760]  All right. So I hope we answered your question very well.
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.520]  I think we got into that one. Thanks for your help on that, Mike. Happy to. Uh,
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:50.600]  we got another message.
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:52.680]  This one came on Facebook and this one came,
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:53.600]  I'm not going to say the dude's name.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.880]  Cause I don't know if people want their name said he sent me a private message.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.480]  He said, listening to your latest podcast, digging it as usual,
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:02.120]  just a quick heads up on your chloramine question for a listener. Uh,
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.880]  and that's what for Seb, shout out to set,
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:07.400]  said Seb asked about the chloramine that was hard as shit to say.
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:11.200]  Uh, chlorine is a gas that can be bubbled or evaporated,
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:15.760]  but chloramine is not Nora. No amount of bubbling will remove chloramine.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:16.640]  In fact,
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:21.320]  its ability to stay in solution is the reason water municipalities are switching
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:24.920]  to it. RO is the only thing that will work.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:26.120]  Unfortunately,
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:30.320]  I know this guy knows what he's talking about because he used the phrase stays
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:33.640]  in solution. And that is definitely organic chemistry major speak,
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:34.480]  because we have a,
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:38.760]  we share a mutual friend who is an O chem major and he says shit like that to me
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:41.480]  all the time. So that makes me think he knows what he's talking about.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:44.840]  So shout out to this guy. Uh, Sam, are you listening? My friend,
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:45.800]  chloramine,
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:49.200]  the only way to get the chloramine out of your water is a reverse osmosis
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:50.800]  machine. So you're going to have to purchase one of those.
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.760]  They sell a cheap one, bro. They sell a small model.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:57.280]  Don't go to the hydro shop for an RO machine. Go to either.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.880]  Like we got a Walmart here in the States.
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:03.800]  I don't know what you guys have in Australia, but like a, uh, like a home,
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:06.080]  like wherever you do, like I'm betting for Seb,
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.240]  the internet's going to be his best bet on this one. Yeah.
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:12.120]  So go to the internet and find yourself an affordable reverse osmosis machine.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.160]  You don't need a lot of water.
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:17.440]  Am I baked or could he just boil off and collect?
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:19.520]  Do you know what I mean?
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:24.040]  I don't know if a distilling water would work because this guy here says that it
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:27.480]  will stay in solution. And I don't know how that's going to work when you distill
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.320]  it. I don't know if the chloramine is going to move.
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.200]  This is like seventh grade science,
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:33.400]  but I'm pretty sure he just needs evaporation.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:38.160]  Now you've got me imagining my buddy said in
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.440]  Australia, you just still in a bunch of water out in the bush, highest shit,
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.120]  chasing the emu.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.400]  I was just going to say, watch your back. There's wild animals.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.320]  Everything's trying to fucking kill him. Now let's help this dude out.
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:55.040]  He needs a reverse osmosis machine, bro. Seb, uh, go get her RO machine.
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:57.640]  It's what you got to do, bro. Just, just go get the right equipment.
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:59.840]  That's important for the grow. You want the water clean.
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:03.240]  You want the water pure, go get that machine, get that chlorine out of there.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:08.000]  Do it and do it. All right. Uh, thanks to a, he said, hope that helps.
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.960]  And keep up the great work. Part of the little community you've built.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.320]  Yeah. Oh, the people that send in the messages are great.
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:16.640]  I totally appreciate them because there'll be some times when I'm not exactly
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:18.800]  sure what I want to talk about. I'll have a couple of ideas.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:21.600]  I've got tons of notes written down for this podcast. If I ever run out of info,
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.560]  I'm just like, Oh, look, here's the notebook. And there's tons of shit.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.840]  But when these guys send messages, I'm like, Oh, there's that's instant shit.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:28.400]  That I need to talk about. These guys want to know.
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.080]  So I just go and do some research if I need to.
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:31.960]  And most of the time I can spit it out off the top of my head.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:35.920]  I like that this guy just solved Seb's problem. Yep. I just got to be a medium.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:40.280]  Is that what I did? Yep. That's weird. All right. So that's, uh,
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:43.080]  that's the core mean message that I wrote down.
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:44.880]  So we're talking about this a little bit ago.
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:48.160]  I just went and got my MMJ card, my medical marijuana recommendation.
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:51.520]  I'm going to rant for a minute. There is in Colorado. There's no,
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:53.280]  I don't think anywhere in the United States.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.640]  Is there a medical marijuana prescription other than the type that Irv
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:01.200]  Rosenfeld has, which is a totally different thing than what's available to us.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:03.880]  So, uh, it's a recommendation.
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:06.960]  If you've got a medical marijuana card here in Colorado, it is a recommendation.
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:09.800]  It's a recommendation from a doctor that you use cannabis to alleviate your
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:10.240]  problems.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:12.240]  It's not a prescription because they can't prescribe it to you because there's
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.520]  nowhere to go get it. So it's a recommendation. But people,
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:19.080]  I was talking about getting my medical marijuana recommendation renewed a few
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.680]  days ago, talking about when I got stuck in the damn elevator.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:24.560]  And a couple of people were like, well, how do I get my card?
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:27.440]  And I'm sure that since you work at a dispensary and you work at a dispensary,
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:28.840]  you guys hear it at least once a week,
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:32.560]  not as much Mike because his place is recreational. Okay.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:37.080]  So let's just do a little brief talk about how you get your medical marijuana
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:37.520]  card.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:38.040]  First of all,
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:41.000]  you've got to be a Colorado citizen and have some sort of proof of residency.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.400]  You need a Colorado ID or some sort of bills that show that you're getting
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:47.640]  bills here in Colorado. So your phone bills, water bill, electricity bill,
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.520]  some kind of shit like that. You need some bills.
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:51.120]  If you don't have the proper ID,
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.040]  you either need a proper ID or two things that will prove that you're now a
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.640]  Colorado resident, like a pay stub and a bill or something.
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:59.360]  So that's, that's where you got to start. Become a resident of Colorado,
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:02.880]  get established here, get your shit together, have an address. Uh,
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.480]  the second thing, do you have,
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:07.200]  this is what I used to say when I worked at a dispensary like 10 years ago and
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.880]  people would be like, well, can I get a card?
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:12.080]  I would say, do you have a condition that would justify the use of medical
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:12.920]  cannabis?
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.720]  Do you have a qualified condition that would justify the use of medical cannabis
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:18.360]  to improve the quality of your life? That's what I used to ask people. Yeah.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:21.720]  Yeah. So if you have, yeah, there's a list on the, uh,
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.160]  Colorado department of public health and environment.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:27.920]  They have a list of qualifying conditions on there of things that qualify,
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:30.720]  uh, something hurts.
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:35.440]  Severe pain is a qualifying condition and I'm sure that something hurts.
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:40.560]  There's seven or nine listed. And if you don't have one, um,
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.600]  but you've got chronic pain of some sort,
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:46.400]  getting a car just involves two appointments. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:50.920]  And just have a reason why it hurts and have something that hurts and stick with
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.440]  it and have a, know when it happened.
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.760]  And if you can have some paperwork on it, that's way even better.
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:56.400]  Not even really two appointments,
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:00.720]  one appointment and one trip to the post office. If you go to a,
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:04.520]  so Mike's Mike's jumping ahead. Mike's doing Mike's getting extra credit.
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:08.120]  No, this is easy. So, uh, have a condition, figure out what your condition is,
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.880]  figure out what hurts, figure out how you qualify.
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:13.200]  Then you call looking like the Colorado Springs independent.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.880]  If you're in Denver, look in the Westward. If you're in Pueblo, do we have,
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:17.160]  we have the pulp. Uh,
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:20.880]  I'm sure there's somewhere that you can look for a medical marijuana doctor in
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:23.640]  your region. If you were in Colorado or if you're in a state that supports
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:25.480]  medical marijuana, there's a way to find the doctor.
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:29.200]  Google medical marijuana doctor, your state or medical marijuana, your zip code.
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:32.440]  Uh, you'll find them or ask one of your friends that has a medical marijuana
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:35.920]  card where their doctor is. Uh, shout out to my MMJ doc.
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:36.920]  I'm not going to say his name.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:43.760]  If you've got to go see your doctor anyway, they're a doctor. Just ask, um,
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:47.560]  over 900 doctors in the state of signs. So they're not exactly hard to find.
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:51.960]  I realized is why I looked up the other day in the office at my docs thing that
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:54.000]  he's a medical examiner. Does that mean he's the corner?
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:56.720]  It means he can be. Okay. Yeah. That's kind of weird.
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.040]  Do you remember how it was in the beginning though? Oh yeah.
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:02.920]  Like three doctors and they all had like a six month waiting time. Yeah.
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:06.000]  I remember that crazy guy that used to come to our dispensary and give cards.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.360]  Dude, back in the day,
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.760]  you could go into the dispensary and there would be a doctor in there that would
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:12.880]  write your recommendation and you could shop by the time that doctor got done
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:14.680]  filling out your name. You were already picking up.
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:19.000]  Dr. J was insane. It was crazy. It's not like that anymore.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.480]  So now you go to the doctor, I figure out your condition,
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:23.760]  send an appointment, find one of these doctors, send an appointment,
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:28.600]  have records if you really want to know what hurts and then know what to say.
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:31.600]  Like, don't go in there when they're like, so why do you need weed?
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.000]  Because I don't like not having weed actually sound professional.
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:38.000]  Go in there and be legit. Um, yeah,
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:41.960]  honestly the our medical marijuana program here in Colorado is under enough
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:45.280]  scrutiny and pressure and under fire in the legislature.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.680]  If you can't manage to get through the interview with the doctor without looking
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:53.360]  like a jackass and hurting the movement, just stay home. Yeah.
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:56.000]  You don't deserve a card. It's really not hard at all.
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.360]  Especially if you're coming to be an activist. I liked earlier,
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:02.200]  Mike said don't show up with your weed cape. It's like, yeah. Yep. Um,
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:04.520]  like if your knee hurts,
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:08.800]  like if you can elaborate on that for more than a minute or two,
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:12.880]  I'm using medical terminology because you've seen other doctors because your
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:16.960]  knee hurts and they recommended other shit for your knee hurting. Um,
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:20.520]  getting a medical marijuana card for your chronic knee pain will not be a
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:21.280]  problem.
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:24.040]  If you want an extended plant count, you're going to need to be prepared.
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:26.120]  You're going to have to have some sort of crunching noises.
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:28.880]  You're going to have to show some kind of scars or if you've got some paperwork
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:31.000]  that would really help. So you can ask your doctor,
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:34.400]  would you be willing to write an extended plant count for me?
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:38.520]  And he may ask you how many you want. Be prepared to pay for this. Uh,
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:42.040]  the normal cost of a doctor should be around a hundred dollars.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:45.200]  The basic cost to get your basic card should be around a hundred bucks.
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:49.080]  You're going to get an added fee of probably another hundred dollars to get an
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:51.320]  elevated plant count. Depending on how high it is.
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:54.400]  There are some doctors that will go fairly high and they will charge you up to
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:58.160]  four or $500. Don't get a cut. This is my recommendation.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:01.040]  I'm not a fucking lawyer. Uh, I'm a weed guy.
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:03.160]  This is my experience in the cannabis world.
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:06.040]  Don't get one of those 99 plant counts. Uh,
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:09.720]  that's a red flag for a person that is fucking around and trying to beat the
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:12.720]  system and do something that they shouldn't be doing. Um,
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:17.080]  there are a couple of 500 count cards in the state. Don't do that shit.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:21.920]  And there's like eight of them and they're all on a list and the MEDs pen to
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:24.600]  all of the addresses. Yeah. Um,
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:28.400]  and the same thing with the 250 counts and the 300 counts,
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:33.480]  it's all of that's going to be gone in a year, maybe two at the most. Um,
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:36.280]  and it's because of one or two people abusing it.
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:40.400]  Cause one of the people with the 500 count cards is making oil for kids and he
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:44.400]  gives it all away. So like, they're not all game in the system. They're not,
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:47.840]  um, most of them in fact are following the rules,
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.640]  but there's been one or two really,
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:54.160]  really obnoxious people that have really, really pushed the boundaries.
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:59.040]  And most of that system is going to get regulated away the next two years.
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.520]  Um, the caregivers is going to be a thing in the past by 2020.
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.200]  Well, I'm glad you said a caregiver just now,
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:07.040]  cause that's part of the next step. Um,
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:11.160]  ask the doc for an elevated plant count if you desire pay for it. Um, then,
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:14.040]  uh, you're going to be asked at this time,
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:15.240]  you're going to start signing a bunch of papers.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:17.400]  You're going to be asked to assign a provider.
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:21.400]  If you plan on growing your own medicine, you do not want to assign a provider.
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:23.920]  If you are going to be a caregiver, you cannot be a,
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:27.960]  have a provider nor can you have a dispensary as your provider.
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:29.680]  If you're going to be a caregiver, if you become a care,
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:32.440]  if you sign your rights to the plants, to a caregiver,
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:36.000]  you have now waived your rights as a caregiver. I think I said that correctly.
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:37.720]  There's a lot of words that I was trying to get out properly.
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:40.760]  So decide who you want to grow your cannabis. If it's a trusted friend,
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:43.760]  I have a couple of people like Mike and our good buddy, Doug,
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:47.520]  I'm responsible for growing their cannabis and keeping these guys medicated and
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:51.480]  feeling all right. So if you know somebody that grows well and you trust them,
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.440]  make an arrangement with them,
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:57.880]  make a relationship with them and have an agreement where the medicine comes and
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:00.800]  they're ready for it and they've got it and you've got it and shit works and
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.960]  then make them, you have to get papers notarized.
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:05.800]  You'll need a copy of their ID if you're going to make them your caregiver.
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:09.880]  But so the doctor will have everything that you need other than your buddy's ID.
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:11.800]  There'll be a notary there. They'll take care of all that shit.
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:15.760]  So assign a caregiver and then they're going to give you a bunch of papers.
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:19.000]  You'll need a money order. A lot of the places will give you the money order.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.960]  They'll have it there for you. If not, just go to wherever,
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.720]  go to the Western Union, loaf and jug, 711,
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.320]  wherever sells the damn money order to the post office.
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:29.080]  Go get yourself a money order. King supers, King stupids.
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:34.440]  Then you need to mail that certified mail to where you get the thing back when
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:37.560]  they get it so that you get the return receipt so that you know that they have
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.240]  received it and then you wait in the mail.
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.320]  I'm not sure how long it's taken for cards to come back right now.
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:44.280]  Either one of you guys know the time varies.
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:48.080]  I hope not too long cause mine is out of fucking commission right now.
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:51.640]  It expired yesterday. So I can't shop at the dispensary until it comes back.
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:55.040]  It's usually no more than 30 days the last year or two.
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.160]  Um,
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:01.920]  the table went silently. You can't shop for 30 days, bro.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.480]  At one point I grew up.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.040]  I grow at one point it was like an eight month wait. Yeah.
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:09.880]  At one point I was a long time. Yeah.
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:13.120]  That was back when it was a hundred to the doctor and a hundred to the state,
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:16.400]  which meant the state gave you a free year every time you did your card because
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:19.240]  it took us a damn long process. Yeah. Um,
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:21.760]  and that was back when you could still use your temp paperwork for that whole
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.520]  time. Yeah. Oh, no, no.
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:27.160]  I'm pretty sure I accepted fake paperwork when I worked at that old dispensary
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:30.520]  because the paperwork changed so frequently that they would show up with new
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:33.920]  stuff and I'd be like, it looks really right. I don't know. It's notarized.
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:37.080]  I was good. This shit. Sure. Go ahead. Shop. Whatever. Like I had,
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:40.440]  it was hard to verify now. Yeah.
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:43.680]  Now you get a purple card with a barcode on it and your name on it.
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:47.960]  I heard, I heard we're getting a new pool card.
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:50.040]  They're getting cause Lindsay would see firsthand.
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:54.520]  She checks IDs and cards all day. Yeah. Um, it's still the purple cards,
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:58.000]  but actually now for the, uh, the certified mail stuff,
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:02.320]  there's a whole list of ones that like are voided and aren't real and all of
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:05.320]  that. So like you can, when someone comes in, there's just a quick list.
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:08.240]  You have to check. Oh yeah. Of course. That have expired. Yeah.
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:12.440]  Well people who have like stolen cards and stuff like that. Yeah.
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:14.720]  I have a friend, I'm not sure how much detail I can go into.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:18.080]  I have a friend who is employed by a dispensary and they caught somebody
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.800]  stealing like blatantly shoplifting and they saw, they saw the person do it.
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:23.720]  They saw it on camera.
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:26.120]  They went and checked the camera ball. The person was still in the room.
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:28.760]  So if they had proof, you know, they didn't make a false accusation.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:30.600]  They walked outside and they said, Mr. Customer,
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:33.800]  we've got you on camera stealing. Uh, can we have our product back?
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.080]  And they're like, I didn't steal shit. And like, okay, have a good day.
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:37.640]  And they just let the customer leave.
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:39.600]  And they called the cops and the MED and they're like, Hey,
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:42.600]  revoke his card and send police there to get our product back.
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:43.200]  And they went and got there.
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:46.360]  The cops went and got the product back and confiscated his, uh,
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:49.920]  MMJ card and the MED or no, not the MED cause it's not immediate.
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.680]  It's the Colorado department of public health and environment, uh,
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:56.840]  discontinued his card. So they took his card from him and he cannot renew.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:00.680]  So don't steal from a damn dispensary. If you are privileged enough to go in.
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:04.960]  Honestly, there's a reason dispensary robberies are so infrequent.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:09.280]  This is everybody in Colorado has seen the number of cameras that are required
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:13.160]  and has seen the one or two reports of the dude who does rob one.
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:14.560]  You get arrested like an hour later.
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:17.920]  You get seen from 17 different angles, just walking in the place.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:20.640]  You can zoom in on the camera and read the VIN number and you'll win.
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.480]  We had a, yeah, you really can't. He's not even kidding.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:26.600]  We can read the VIN number on, on the inside of your car,
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:29.880]  on the dash tucked in that little gap. We can read that number with the cameras.
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.400]  I hear the security guard go, Nope, that's a cigarette.
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:38.000]  And he's zooming in across like the other side of the parking lot to somebody
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.880]  who just fired something up in the driver's seat.
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:42.840]  Before we had a contractor working on air conditioners the other day in the
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:46.240]  building and a summertime student, summer maintenance on the ACs and shit.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:47.560]  And he walked out to the,
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:49.800]  to the truck to get a tool and put a cigarette in his mouth. And I go,
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:52.800]  Bri, can't have you smoking on the property. I'm sorry. And he goes,
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:55.560]  none's going to see me, bro. And I go, if you look around,
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:58.080]  there's cameras on the outside of the building every eight feet.
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:00.040]  And he looked up and he was like, yo man,
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:03.240]  I'm pretty sure he might've had a cigarette while I was up working on the air
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:05.600]  conditioner. Cause I could smell that shit when I was inside the grow,
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:09.240]  but there aren't any cameras up there, but he was up there smoking on the roof.
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:10.880]  I'm pretty damn sure. Yeah.
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:12.640]  It's people like,
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:16.560]  I see people like trying to put out blunts pulling in all the time. I'm like,
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:18.160]  are you crazy? I'm like,
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:21.320]  Oh, remind me to tell you a story off there. I don't know if I want to.
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:24.520]  Well, no, I, I'd have to tell the new employees,
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:28.320]  remind every employee the first couple times that they're working.
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:30.280]  Like just remember that you're always on a camera.
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:33.560]  Always go to pick your ass.
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:38.240]  Like it's recorded in HD for prosperity for all time.
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:43.040]  Yeah. And the people are watching these cameras.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:46.680]  Like it's not like nobody's watching these cameras and Oh, it doesn't even matter.
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:48.960]  They're just there for show. And they're just there.
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:52.200]  If something bad happens, like people are always watching those cameras.
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:53.520]  They're always reviewing it.
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:55.240]  We have weird things happen.
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:59.320]  Our grow is not in the best part of town and it's at the end of a street where
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:02.200]  you could do whatever you want because honestly it's at the end of the street,
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:03.280]  there's nothing else down there.
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:06.760]  So nobody travels that direction unless they're coming to our grow to do some
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:11.120]  stupid shit. And oftentimes I'll find parts of the gate.
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:13.800]  Like they'll have unscrewed all of the bolts on the gate,
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:18.120]  but they use the types of bolts to where the nuts won't come off the end of the
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:21.320]  bolt. They took the end of the bolt and flattened it. Like after it was so now,
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:24.560]  you can only unscrew it so far. You'll get that bracket really well on done,
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:25.640]  but you can't get it off still.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.800]  And they're trying to get our gate open because our gates barbed wire to the
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:31.120]  cross, three layers of fucking barbed wire across the top.
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.640]  So you can't get in through that. So they're trying to just get it open.
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:36.480]  And shit like that happens every other day. Uh,
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:39.800]  they threw carpets over the barbed wire and climbed the fence.
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:44.680]  And then we had locked trash cans and they climbed up on high shit and
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:49.320]  jumped like body slammed through the trash can lids to get to our trash.
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:51.400]  And there wasn't even anything good in there.
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:55.960]  There was actually an exploded bag of compound putty that I'd thrown away.
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:59.000]  So whoever jumped in there that night was covered in compound putty,
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:01.320]  fucking funny. Cause there's a footprint going to the fucking,
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.040]  but then they had to climb back over that gate and with their carpets and
[01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:08.680]  covered in compound putties and get in their car and drive away.
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:12.760]  But we've got footage of all of that shit. And every time we see it,
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.600]  we've got a thing, the camera lights up,
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:18.240]  the video lights up red if there's no action on the camera.
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:20.520]  And then it lights up green dots every time there's movement.
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.400]  So we can just go scroll right to the green. Like, Oh,
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:24.960]  there's that diption on camera one. There is a camera 16.
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:28.320]  There is a camera eight and to see him from all angles doing stupid shit.
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:31.880]  So people do see all of that footage that happens. Yeah.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.400]  And even if we're randomly looking for one time,
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:37.400]  we lost something in the grow. We're like, where the fuck did it go?
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:38.600]  We couldn't find where something went.
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:42.320]  We just totally found where it started and then just watched it on the camera,
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:44.680]  watched where it traveled through a couple of days. And then we're like, Oh,
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:46.800]  it's up on this top shelf where nobody can even see it.
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:48.840]  Now it is right up here and just went and grabbed it.
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:52.040]  And who knows what other shit we may have seen if we would have paid attention
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.000]  to that video. Cause we were around like an entire day.
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:56.920]  There'll be people scratching their balls, picking their noses,
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:58.240]  taking their asses.
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:00.280]  No, we have people,
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:02.800]  somebody will walk out to their car and notice it's been dinged.
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:07.800]  And five minutes later they're on the phone with PD. Like, yeah,
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:10.440]  my car was in my work parking lot today. I know who did.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:11.560]  We've got the license plate on video.
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:14.040]  Everything's on everything, not just dispensaries, guys.
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:17.080]  Everything's on camera now. Be careful. Be careful.
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:19.680]  If you're out there smoking, you're out there doing whatever you're doing.
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:20.520]  You're on camera.
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:23.840]  Be aware of your surroundings. It's there's people everywhere and they don't all
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:24.680]  like us.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.600]  A lot of them do not like us.
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:28.640]  Some people don't like falafel. I mean,
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:31.600]  yeah, we didn't talk about that on the air, but, um,
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:33.200]  sorry, somewhere.
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:36.880]  And somebody accused me of consuming cannabis while I was eating a sandwich.
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:40.160]  Like it's not illegal to have, you can't do that here and have lunch at the same
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:44.400]  time. I'm eating a falafel. It's fucking good. He wants to, you mad boo.
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:48.760]  Free the falafel. Yes. Free the falafel. All right,
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:50.000]  you guys have been going for like 30 minutes.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.840]  People only like to listen to 36 minute podcasts. Yeah. Listen longer. Yeah.
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:55.960]  I don't know why 36 minutes is the prime number for us.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.520]  They like it when we ramble hashtag. I like it when you ramble. Um, this, uh,
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:03.960]  do you guys have anything you'd like to bring to the table for this fine podcast?
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:07.160]  Make sure you're registered to vote. Yes. I think we covered that on the last one.
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:09.640]  Um, covering it again. So I want to give a shout out.
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:13.760]  I don't have the listener's name. I should push pause, press pause and go, uh,
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:15.160]  search through my Facebook messages.
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:18.800]  But there was a listener who mentioned Gary Johnson in the past. Remember this?
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:22.000]  Yeah. And suddenly dude is getting popular. Um,
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:27.080]  there are a lot of people that are dissatisfied with the current candidates and
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:30.080]  Gary's getting a little bit of traction. He was on one of my favorite podcasts.
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:33.000]  I think he was on the nerdest podcast.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.320]  He was on one of the good ones that I listened to him. I don't want on Joe Rogan.
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:38.440]  That wouldn't surprise me. I can't remember. I should see.
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:40.160]  I should press pause and do some research right now,
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:44.000]  but I should find the kind of listener who introduced us to Gary Johnson or I
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.360]  should go. I think it was Joe Rogan, but Gary Johnson was on a podcast recently.
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:52.240]  And the dude makes sense. He seemed to me, he didn't give politician answers.
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:54.240]  They'd be like, Hey, what's two plus two. And he wouldn't go, well,
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:58.280]  I really think like 4.3 would look good. He would leave like four,
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:00.840]  two and two is four. Like he was straight up about shit.
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:02.320]  That's how I feel like politicians do it.
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:05.120]  Like what's your favorite flavor ice cream and a politician's like, well,
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.640]  I really feel like cake is the way to go in 2017. They're like, all right,
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:11.120]  motherfucker, what's your favorite flavor ice cream?
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:13.680]  Well you see pie has always been my favorite.
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:15.920]  That's what you get from most politicians in my opinion.
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:20.760]  I'm a big Gary Johnson fan and he's a very much pro medical marijuana,
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:25.000]  pro marijuana legalization, um, pro ending the drug war.
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:29.240]  Um, but I don't think he's a viable candidates though.
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:30.840]  Some of his money plans are a little goofy.
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:35.120]  Uh, all right. We're not going to go too political here on the show.
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:37.480]  Gary Johnson's economic plans.
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:40.640]  But the dude came out of nowhere and one of our listeners kind of predicted that
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:42.960]  shit. So shout out to our listener. Thanks for paying attention for us.
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:45.200]  Thanks for making me aware of the guy. Cause I, uh,
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:46.920]  the second time I heard about him was on,
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.920]  I'm pretty sure it was the Joe Rogan experience podcast.
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:50.320]  Shout out to Joe Rogan for doing that thing.
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:52.280]  That dude's on like 800 and something fucking episodes.
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:55.880]  Yeah. Him and Chris Hardwick are leading that shit forever.
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:56.880]  Well they started it.
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:00.400]  I think Corolla might get some credit for starting it,
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:03.480]  but I don't know if he really started it, but I know Corolla is up there too.
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:06.440]  Those are some of the podcasting heroes, I guess.
[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:09.400]  All right. I'm looking forward to seeing what Gary does with the rest of the year.
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:10.000]  That's for sure.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.200]  I want to see what the rest of everything does. Uh,
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:15.080]  and what the fuck is happening in Canada? They're like, Oh,
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:17.240]  we're going to legalize cannabis. And then what,
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:21.800]  why are the fucking Royal Canadian mounted police raiding dispensaries in Canada
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:22.920]  now that cannabis is legal?
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:27.280]  People kind of jumped the gun. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. It's,
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:32.520]  it sucks. And I really don't agree with what the authorities did. Um,
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.920]  but at the same time, if you didn't see it coming,
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:38.560]  you're blind deaf and we're watching some months. Um,
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:43.120]  they've been saying for weeks that you can't do this. It's not legal yet.
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:44.920]  The rules haven't been passed. True.
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:49.320]  They haven't figured out zoning or hours of operation or taxes or none of that
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:52.800]  shit yet. Um, and I mean,
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:55.320]  you're just slowing down the movement by jumping, jumping the gun.
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:59.160]  I think they've decided on the legal age of 24 is what consumption age is going
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:00.000]  to be in Canada.
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:05.040]  There's there's, I listened to a guy with the Canadian podcast and I think he
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:08.680]  was saying that 24 is what they were discussing last time. Um,
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:13.800]  it's a little old in my mind. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:16.760]  It should be closer to 18 in my opinion, but 21 is cool.
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:20.120]  Yeah. I think I have to go with 21. Unfortunately.
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:24.120]  I've got a daughter who's creeping up on 18. Uh, if she came up to me right now,
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:26.000]  and she's like, yo dad, can I get a dab? I'd be like, well,
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.960]  you got to smoke some flower first. But I mean, like I'd,
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:31.480]  I'd probably if she wanted to sit down with us and smoke,
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:34.720]  I would not tell her no because I'd rather her sit down and puff with us than
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:36.920]  run off with her little girlfriends and smoke.
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:39.000]  True. Well here in Colorado,
[01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:42.680]  if you're under like between 18 and 21 and have a medical condition,
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:43.760]  you can get a card, right?
[01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:45.960]  My daughter has no interest in smoking cannabis anyway.
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:51.000]  I'm just putting that out there. She thinks it smells stupid is what she said.
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:52.680]  I just did this with my niece.
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:56.360]  I'm about to do it again with my nephew and I've got a kid who's like almost
[01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:58.840]  one. So I'm going to be doing it again in a few years.
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:03.160]  So like somewhere between 18 and 21 works for me. Um,
[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:07.240]  I kind of like the idea of a much safer, gentler,
[01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:10.000]  intoxicant being legal before alcohol. Yeah.
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:12.880]  So you're kind of like some training wheels before you just push a little
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:15.520]  fucker down the hill on his bike. Right. Um,
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:17.840]  what are you referring to your own kid is that little fucker?
[01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:21.960]  Probably. I'm so tired right now because he likes to cry when I sleep.
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:24.360]  They do that, bro.
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:27.000]  Birth control people. It's a thing you should practice with it.
[01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:31.960]  Don't get me wrong. I love my kid, but wow,
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:35.360]  you really don't want one of these when you're young. Uh, get old first.
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:37.680]  It's easier. I love these podcasts.
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:42.200]  Hey, Jeff said all the people that tune out after half an hour to not everybody.
[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:43.040]  So this is awesome.
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:47.000]  Six minutes to stick around. I love you guys. I love all the listeners.
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.040]  Everyone's been quiet. So we had to break her up.
[01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:53.680]  I've been really stoned. Um, plus, I mean,
[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:57.160]  she showed up with like five grams of hash. It was like, who wants to dab?
[01:59:57.440 --> 01:59:59.480]  Is there anything you'd like to talk about on the show tonight?
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:01.520]  Would you like to take a minute? Oh my God.
[02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:02.920]  Is there anything you'd like to bring to the table?
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:05.760]  Blushing. We should,
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:10.040]  you and I should give a shout out to hunt and Amy and the rest of the green and
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:14.720]  wellness crew because, uh, I thought Amy put the party together.
[02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:17.600]  It turns out Joe put the party together and then hunts the boss.
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:20.280]  So shout out to everybody that put the party together for the green and healthy,
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:23.440]  healthy wellness crew. I was fine. It was the first time I ever took dabs of
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:26.400]  breezy. So that was fun. It was a good time dabbing with you.
[02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:29.560]  We got to do that. The boss took us out to dinner afterward.
[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:32.040]  We got to go to the old rabbit hole and get some good ass food.
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:37.000]  That was insane. Once your food was delivered, you went fucking silent.
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:39.200]  She was like, food, shut up.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.480]  I saw some of the social media stuff from this event,
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:45.000]  so I don't blame her for being baked and tearing into food.
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:48.080]  Oh, we got, we got plenty baked. The boss showed up and passed out edibles.
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:50.400]  He's like, thank you for coming. Thank you for coming here. Your edibles.
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:53.520]  And then he looked at me and he's like, here's lots of edibles for you.
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:56.480]  Kind of fucked me up a little bit. It was nice.
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:01.400]  But the rabbit hole was a good ass time. The boys ate, uh, well, not just the boys,
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:05.600]  the boys and a young lady, uh, because Amy was involved in that. Um,
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:07.480]  they did a thing called the butcher's block,
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:11.520]  which is pretty much a big slab of wood with, uh, one of every animal.
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:14.480]  You can imagine cooked beautifully. I'm a vegetarian.
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:17.000]  And I was looking at it like that is beautiful.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.760]  Like whoever did this as a fucking artist,
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:21.720]  like they did a really good job on that. I'm,
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.120]  I'm not hateful to people who consume meat because I'm a vegetarian.
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:27.800]  I'm not that guy. Eat your stuff, do it, put it away in your mouth,
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:29.800]  whatever you want. I just don't want to eat any of that crap, you know?
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:35.080]  But that stuff was beautiful. There was a cherry, what was it? Cherry braised,
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:40.240]  Oh, um, back ribs, pork ribs or something like that. Uh,
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:42.840]  whatever it was, it looked, it was picturesque. I was like,
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:45.320]  let's take some food network shit right there. They did a really good job.
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:48.240]  So shout out to the whole crew. Thanks for taking us out to dinner.
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:50.000]  Thanks Joe and Amy for putting the party together.
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:53.880]  What was the name of the place where we smoked dabs? Uh, studio a 64.
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:56.120]  Shout out to that place for letting us go in there and take some dabs.
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:58.360]  It was a cool atmosphere. Uh, it's kind of weird.
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:01.120]  It's like an old bar that they just cleaned out and where there used to be beer
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:03.360]  bottles. Now there are bongs and, uh,
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:04.840]  there's been some fun reporting on it.
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:08.800]  Cause isn't there another consumption club? Like there's 64,
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:10.960]  then there's like a different kind of store.
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:14.400]  And then there's another smoke shop or smoke club.
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:19.400]  Isn't there there's store 64, which is like a dispensary,
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:21.280]  which is across the street from green and healthy.
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:29.320]  And then there's studio a 60. Yeah, whatever. Yeah.
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:30.480]  Where are we went and dabbed. Okay.
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:33.800]  I might be thinking of a shop or a smoke club with a very similar name.
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:37.680]  Maybe I'm not sure. To be honest with you, I only really go to Canada.
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:41.120]  Yeah. No, there's your outfit has either the,
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:45.440]  the acronym THC or the amendment a 64 working with the title.
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:47.600]  I kind of shake my head and I look for the next one on the block.
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.040]  Not to be too big of a dick. It's just easier to avoid the,
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:56.680]  I had a mediocre corporate brain fart one day in business school and then open a
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:58.280]  dispensary places that way.
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:03.240]  I just hope I didn't just bitch slap like 30 dispensary.
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:06.440]  I get when we ramble. All right, guys, we're going to wrap up this podcast.
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:08.000]  I want to thank everybody for listening. Lindsay.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.760]  I want to thank you for joining us. Thank you for letting me stay here.
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:13.600]  Big shout out to my good friend, bubble blaster, co-bubble. You're in Florida.
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:16.560]  Can't wait for you to come back. He's in Portugal. He's in Portugal. Now he went,
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:19.680]  he's this man's dude's been traveling, getting dirtier.
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:21.440]  Them dreadlocks are getting more work. Like bro,
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:24.240]  I hope you're having a good time in Portugal. Don't listen to this in Portugal.
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:27.240]  If you're listening right now, just turn it off and go do Portuguese stuff.
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:30.280]  I don't know what that is. Go to the beach, dude. Yeah.
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:32.560]  Go run around on the beach and have a good time. Enjoy yourself, Chris.
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:36.720]  We miss you, bro. When you get back, I want to take some dabs. Yes. Mike,
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:37.360]  thanks for coming, bro.
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:40.320]  Thanks for taking some time away from the crying baby to come hang out with us.
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:44.520]  Thanks for racing over here after work. Right. I appreciate that.
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:47.080]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friends,
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:49.480]  George and Amanda just because Amanda just texted me and said, Hey,
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:52.680]  Hey, what you doing? So she just earned herself a shout out on the podcast.
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:56.120]  What's up friend? What am I doing? I'm about to text you and say, come dab.
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:59.640]  Actually I'm texting right now. It just says dabs. There we go.

[02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:28.920]  That's the evening's name.
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:35.040]  Sorry. I had to work all day. All right,
[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:38.200]  we're going to wrap up the podcast. Thanks for coming and hanging out.
[02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:41.200]  You guys. Uh, thanks to everybody for listening. I love everybody that listens.
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:44.360]  You're like my, uh, my weird adopted kids, a little cannabis family.
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:46.400]  I truly appreciate each and every one of you.
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:49.440]  Big old shout out to my family that's moved out to Washington. I miss you,
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:52.520]  Maddie. I miss you, Spencer. I miss you. So rock and Nani. Uh,
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:55.960]  so until next time you guys take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:07:44.330 --> 02:07:45.170]  Okay.
[02:08:16.050 --> 02:08:17.010]  I see no doubt.
[02:08:20.050 --> 02:08:23.450]  I need attendance from my nurse around the clock.
[02:08:28.730 --> 02:08:31.050]  There's no prescription for me.
[02:08:33.330 --> 02:08:36.610]  She's the one, the only remedy.
[02:08:46.610 --> 02:08:48.930]  Only you alone can quench this.
[02:09:05.250 --> 02:09:06.690]  I'm hurt by love.
[02:09:16.050 --> 02:09:17.050]  I don't want to see no doubt.
[02:09:25.050 --> 02:09:28.610]  I need attendance from my nurse around the clock.
[02:09:33.610 --> 02:09:36.250]  Cause there's no prescription for me.
[02:09:38.410 --> 02:09:41.770]  She's the one, the only remedy.
[02:09:46.050 --> 02:09:46.890]  My nurse.
[02:09:51.610 --> 02:09:54.770]  Only you alone can quench this thirst.
[02:09:58.610 --> 02:09:59.450]  My night nurse.
[02:10:04.330 --> 02:10:07.290]  All the pain is getting worse.
[02:10:10.010 --> 02:10:11.490]  I'm hurt by love.
[02:10:16.810 --> 02:10:17.650]  And I'm sure
[02:10:22.810 --> 02:10:23.650]  no doctor can cure.
[02:10:46.050 --> 02:10:46.890]  Yeah.
[02:11:11.610 --> 02:11:12.970]  Welcome back cannabis community.

[02:11:48.730 --> 02:11:51.930]  I am joined by my friends from the Colorado podcast. That's right.

[02:11:56.730 --> 02:11:57.970]  swap cast. That's right.
[02:11:57.970 --> 02:12:01.010]  My friends have a podcast called the Colorado podcast.
[02:12:01.010 --> 02:12:02.530]  And we came and recorded one episode.
[02:12:02.530 --> 02:12:04.210]  We're going to put it up on both of our feeds.

[02:12:20.170 --> 02:12:22.650]  there's just a lot of random chatter. There's no real order.
[02:12:22.850 --> 02:12:25.090]  These boys run a different type of podcast than I do.
[02:12:25.090 --> 02:12:28.610]  So we just kind of went with it and I am putting it out as a Thursday bonus
[02:12:28.610 --> 02:12:31.250]  episode. This episode is going to come out on June 2nd.

[02:12:58.970 --> 02:13:11.820]  Hang on for just one minute. So how do you guys want to start this?
[02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:13.140]  You just want to be like this. We'll check it out guys.
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:13.900]  We're hanging out at the table.
[02:13:13.900 --> 02:13:16.220]  We're doing on what I like to call a swap cast with two,
[02:13:16.580 --> 02:13:19.420]  two cool ass Colorado podcasts. It's cheesy as fuck, right?
[02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:22.260]  We're going to do a swap cast sitting at the table.
[02:13:22.740 --> 02:13:25.100]  I'm Rasta Jeff from the growth of my heart podcast.
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:27.820]  If you're listening on the Colorado podcast feed, what's up guys,
[02:13:27.820 --> 02:13:30.700]  my name is Rasta Jeff. Thanks for jumping in. If you're listening on my feed,
[02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:33.180]  joining me at my table is our buddy, Jesse.
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:34.900]  Hey, go fuck your mother.
[02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:43.260]  The line. Okay. Hard at it right there. Hey,
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:46.780]  we're recording his fuck.

[02:13:52.100 --> 02:13:54.220]  We're going to do it. You thought I was going to fuck things up.
[02:13:58.220 --> 02:14:01.420]  We're rolling with it. I was kind of testing the waters, but that's fucking gold.
[02:14:01.420 --> 02:14:05.220]  There's no reason to edit that shit out over here next to filthy Jesse with a
[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:08.660]  filthy fucking mouth and a bar of soap. What are you good? We are Derek,
[02:14:08.660 --> 02:14:12.100]  but what are you dirty? D fucking call you on despicable Derek,
[02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:13.340]  despicable Derek. All right,

[02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:19.660]  appreciate it. Thank you for letting us be a part of your show. This is fun.
[02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:22.020]  I like doing this swappy thing. I've been sitting over here. My brother,
[02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:26.300]  number 44. Is that what we call you? Just 44. I call you 44 and two. Yeah.
[02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:31.340]  You're, you're really the originality of that. I mean, 44. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:32.980]  I didn't like it at first. Don't get me wrong,
[02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:36.140]  but it kind of grows on you and it's one quite a few hat pins. So I mean,
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:40.340]  I can't really bitch like shout out to a sour seed company for throwing down.
[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:43.660]  Absolutely. That's my boy right there. No, he,
[02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:45.780]  he comes in the shop and we've talked,
[02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:48.940]  I didn't know he was like a literature originally from Florida.
[02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:51.180]  We literally live 15 minutes.
[02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:55.220]  You guys were probably peeing in the same pond. Absolutely. Absolutely.
[02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:58.580]  Same dirt roads and same stuff like that. Oh shit. Yeah.
[02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:03.260]  You can go sing a song about it and eventually I'm telling you, I told him,
[02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:05.620]  I told him today that we're going to have to, we're going to,
[02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:08.180]  it's going to, someone's going to ask for me and Jesse remix, you know,
[02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:12.180]  somehow dropping hot fire, you know, dropping hot fire.
[02:15:13.460 --> 02:15:16.620]  He's got a mullet and he just said dropping hot. I mean,
[02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:18.060]  you need to drop that haircut.
[02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:22.380]  I can't make up my fucking mind. Leave me alone.
[02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:26.700]  He does being lazy. He's got a dread mullet happening. It's mo locks.
[02:15:27.020 --> 02:15:27.860]  It's mo locks.
[02:15:28.460 --> 02:15:33.060]  Sort of dreadlocks. Sort of dreadlocks. Eventually. Hey, it's dude,
[02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:37.540]  if you can rock it and don't give a fuck, it works. I'm telling you more power to
[02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:41.740]  you. Absolutely. Those are very, very punk rock dreadlocks. Yeah.
[02:15:42.180 --> 02:15:43.900]  Either Kentucky or punk rock.
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:48.940]  I got what the web is in the lovely facilities here in the County.
[02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:51.300]  I got the name Mota. So, you know,
[02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:53.380]  there was actually somebody in there with a beautiful,
[02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:56.380]  a beautiful like flowing Tennessee waterfall.
[02:15:56.380 --> 02:15:59.060]  Like the best one I've ever seen. And literally dude,
[02:15:59.060 --> 02:16:02.700]  everybody kept asking him, where are you from Kentucky? Like, and he's like, no,
[02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:05.100]  I'm from here. And he's just like, he was a normal dude,
[02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:07.260]  but he had the best mullet ever.
[02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:10.780]  Shout out to the dude with a killer mullet in, in, in County lockup,
[02:16:11.020 --> 02:16:12.180]  Tennessee waterfall.
[02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:21.260]  Perfectly. I'm gonna take a dab. Somebody else. Yeah. Okay. So yeah.
[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:24.580]  What are you been up to? Like besides, besides taking dabs,
[02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:28.900]  I'm going to take a dab. You asked me a question. Good job. 44. Yeah, no,
[02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:30.900]  no problem. So how's your week been Jesse?
[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:36.820]  I wasn't going to go there with that. That's why I was kind of lost in the moment.
[02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:40.500]  You know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, let me ask you, how's it,
[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:43.500]  how does it feel to be here at the table? Like recording,
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:46.340]  we've talked about like, it feels awesome. All right, cool.
[02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:47.620]  Other than my hand. But yeah.
[02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:50.740]  I'm wondering if we can turn them green.
[02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:54.980]  This show and this table has turned a handful of people green.
[02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:56.740]  You want to admit that you were part of that group?
[02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:02.700]  I've been multiple part of that group over and over again. That RSO,
[02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:05.780]  that is the highest I've ever been. I'm not sure what you're talking about.
[02:17:05.780 --> 02:17:10.060]  RSO ice hash, whatever the ice, the ISO ISO. Sorry. Or no, it was just,
[02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:13.620]  I wasn't even ISO. It was PHO. I think. I don't remember. Fuck man.
[02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:18.180]  We took solventless hash and then we pressed it and use a Rosin press to press
[02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:22.220]  out some solvent lists and fresh Rosin solvent. And then I rolled it out again.
[02:17:22.220 --> 02:17:25.300]  I heated up a carb cap and rolled it out like solventless and gave him a fat
[02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:28.260]  dab. There's no operating moving vehicles at that point, bro.
[02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:30.620]  Like I literally pulled over and slept in a parking lot.
[02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:33.100]  I may have been homeless at the time, but I was going somewhere else.
[02:17:33.140 --> 02:17:34.860]  You know what I'm saying? Like that was the parking lot.
[02:17:34.860 --> 02:17:38.940]  You were supposed to go meet Jesse at the time. And I was like, I texted Jeff.
[02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:42.180]  I was like, Hey, text Jesse. I can't function.
[02:17:42.180 --> 02:17:45.420]  Possession ticket. No, no. That was, that was why I came over here.
[02:17:45.460 --> 02:17:47.340]  I think it was to tell him about the possession.
[02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:50.820]  I was headed to be homeless somewhere else.
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:57.580]  It's gotta be the best part about being homeless. Like, fuck it. Here looks good.
[02:18:00.380 --> 02:18:03.780]  I'm never leaving again. You know, like this is, and everybody's like, why Pablo?
[02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:07.460]  And it's like, why not? Why not? You know, like just go from Walmart to Walmart.
[02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:11.620]  There's two of them. So, you know, I want to talk about this for a second. Uh,
[02:18:11.660 --> 02:18:14.580]  since a lot of people that listen to my podcast expect some sort of cannabis
[02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:18.500]  stock, Adam got the only person that I have ever seen.
[02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:21.060]  It happened to got a possession of cannabis ticket.
[02:18:21.140 --> 02:18:23.540]  I'm definitely the first person this year. Right.
[02:18:23.540 --> 02:18:25.340]  Since we have legalized cannabis.
[02:18:26.180 --> 02:18:27.140]  Tons of them a year.
[02:18:28.340 --> 02:18:29.660]  I that's what you told me.
[02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:33.380]  Made me feel better about myself. Like don't give me shit.
[02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:37.620]  Friends are for. Yeah, exactly. All right. Well then I may be the only person.
[02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:40.980]  Yeah. I may have dreamt that I may have just been,
[02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:44.380]  I may have left and heard his words in my own, in my own voice and been like,
[02:18:44.380 --> 02:18:48.180]  yeah, this is not the most perfect elbow. These mic stands are killer.
[02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:52.260]  I discovered that like two shows ago, but over there it doesn't work as good.
[02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:55.700]  No, no, this isn't this right here. It's like, yeah, these mic stands.
[02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:58.140]  I'm completely away from the table at any point.
[02:18:58.140 --> 02:19:00.940]  There's a thousand dollars in glass on the table right now. And I'm like, no,
[02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:04.180]  none of there's water bottles and shit. There's more than that. I'm good.
[02:19:04.220 --> 02:19:08.780]  This one, this one was a G. Yeah. Well, I mean, Hey, that piece though.
[02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:11.620]  That piece though. Yeah. Yeah. Shout out to the person that made that.
[02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:15.580]  Lots of people get tickets in national parks. I don't know about that.
[02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:18.580]  I'm always home improvement park. Every time you go to the woods in Florida,
[02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:21.060]  do you, you damn sure walk out of there with a can of,
[02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:24.140]  somebody walks out and somebody owned up to it and they're like, well, I mean,
[02:19:24.180 --> 02:19:27.060]  I'm a ride everybody a ticket, which we all know that's a bunch of bullshit.
[02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:28.020]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:30.340]  Somebody's got to own up to it or you just found some weed, bro.
[02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:33.340]  I don't know what to tell you. Good smoking that, you know, like no,
[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:36.940]  every time you go to the national forest in Florida, you get a cannabis ticket.
[02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:41.140]  Don't care. Yeah, but it's not legal. It's not. And it probably Colorado.
[02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:43.900]  It's legal and you can still get a ticket. No, if you're not,
[02:19:43.940 --> 02:19:47.740]  what if you're smoking in the wrong area, if you're smoking at a state park,
[02:19:47.940 --> 02:19:51.060]  if you're smoking at the skate park, what about, what about if he,
[02:19:51.740 --> 02:19:53.780]  you're watching a movie with your cat in your lap,
[02:19:53.780 --> 02:19:57.420]  trying to stay warm while it's snowing and you're in your car though,
[02:19:57.420 --> 02:20:01.500]  you're smoking a bowl because you're watching a movie happens to be the best
[02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:06.020]  movie pretty much of the beginning of the year. They ruined star Wars.
[02:20:06.020 --> 02:20:08.780]  Fuck them. I've fucked the police. I don't care what you guys say.
[02:20:09.660 --> 02:20:13.020]  That's the way I feel about it. These are all the opinions of our good. Yeah.
[02:20:13.140 --> 02:20:18.140]  44 44 44 and one absinthe 44 and two. No, no, no, no, no.
[02:20:19.340 --> 02:20:21.100]  We dabbing over there, bro. Tell us about what we're dabbing.
[02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:26.580]  Beautiful looking chatter. 44 and a fourth, 44 and a quarter. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:20:27.060 --> 02:20:30.540]  See 45 just doesn't roll off the tongue. 44 plus one ankle monitor.
[02:20:31.540 --> 02:20:36.460]  Right. What time do you have to be home tonight? Uh, I,
[02:20:37.020 --> 02:20:39.540]  honestly I told him today that we're doing two podcasts.
[02:20:39.540 --> 02:20:42.700]  So it was kind of like whenever I know I'm good for an hour or two.
[02:20:42.780 --> 02:20:45.540]  I have the second show you've recorded today. Absolutely. Nice.
[02:20:45.540 --> 02:20:49.100]  So is that why you guys were like, we've done this already? Yeah. Sorry. I didn't,
[02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:50.820]  I didn't mean to not fill in your audience.
[02:20:51.220 --> 02:20:54.540]  Bro. No, it's cool, man. Do you think, do you think it shows in when he can?
[02:20:54.540 --> 02:20:56.100]  I know how it is trying to record a podcast.
[02:20:56.260 --> 02:20:58.060]  You can put that torch right up to the mic, dude.
[02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:02.460]  I don't want him to Thursdays are normal recording days.
[02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:05.300]  Me too. That's my normal shout out to Rasta said, by the way, I was shot.
[02:21:07.740 --> 02:21:11.100]  Yeah. He told us a straight up that we were, we were a little mean to each other.
[02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:14.340]  So we've been trying to be more positive. You and said, we're mean to each other.
[02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:15.900]  No, no, no. I mean, Derek, I've had that.
[02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:18.340]  You said that you two were mean to all of us.
[02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:20.860]  So you guys talk a lot of shit to each other on your podcast.
[02:21:20.900 --> 02:21:24.340]  I listened to the Colorado podcast. You guys kind of raz each other. Yeah.
[02:21:24.380 --> 02:21:26.100]  Well, I mean, I just said you've read, I mean,
[02:21:28.060 --> 02:21:29.540]  I don't know down at the box.
[02:21:32.580 --> 02:21:34.540]  Stop being so damn mean to each other.
[02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:36.700]  Yeah. We're just friends.
[02:21:38.020 --> 02:21:40.660]  You guys should take some dabs and play some video games.
[02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:44.500]  I guess just that's, that's just how our friendship kind of evolved. Yeah.
[02:21:45.260 --> 02:21:48.580]  I mean, it was good to fuck with Adam. It was a construction friendship.
[02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:52.460]  You remember, I mean, you were here around, that's kind of when I gave you a
[02:21:52.460 --> 02:21:54.620]  shout out on the show one time I told you to fucking get to work.
[02:21:54.620 --> 02:21:56.380]  Oh yeah. I heard that one. Actually.
[02:21:56.420 --> 02:21:59.740]  That was great too. Cause we were literally working and he walks in and it's like,
[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:03.900]  Hey Derek, get to fucking work. And he was like, fuck this. Fuck you guys.
[02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:11.140]  We might've, we might've picked that scab that day though. You know what I'm saying?
[02:22:11.140 --> 02:22:16.140]  Like I love Derek just simply for that reason. Oh, is that what is that?
[02:22:16.820 --> 02:22:21.700]  I see what happened. I see it. Oh, that's fucking funny. Just cover the hole.
[02:22:21.820 --> 02:22:25.780]  Welcome to the table. Welcome to the table. The courts, you can burn it off.
[02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:29.140]  There's another courts banger over there. There's another banger in the,
[02:22:29.260 --> 02:22:30.980]  on the shelf. I could shotgun this.
[02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:35.340]  So let's fill in the listeners on what just happened. Uh,
[02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:39.220]  so dirty D took a dab, set the rig down and uh,
[02:22:39.260 --> 02:22:42.820]  just rested it gently up against Jesse's, uh, his tea bottle.
[02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:46.180]  Now it's perfectly carved. Now he's got a carb. Yeah.
[02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:50.100]  How'd it go down your throat? Like that last sip was smooth. Yeah.
[02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:54.140]  It went down like a wide mouth can or something like a shotgun Keystone.
[02:22:55.260 --> 02:22:58.420]  Back in college, man. That Bob Ross, that too, right there.
[02:22:58.420 --> 02:23:01.540]  Everybody's going to, there's going to be people tuning in like this dude,
[02:23:01.540 --> 02:23:03.860]  shotgun a key stand before we're good.
[02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:07.580]  My listeners don't know what the fuck is going on.
[02:23:10.100 --> 02:23:13.340]  I mean if they're old listeners, they might, they might remember, but this is,
[02:23:13.460 --> 02:23:17.660]  I'm chaos. Uh, you know, the girl from your heart meets a trailer park.
[02:23:20.620 --> 02:23:23.220]  Oh, that's good. That's pretty good. Yeah.
[02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:28.100]  Yes. This one summarizes that very nicely there.
[02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:31.980]  Adam's going to hit the, uh, the hit man, Samson collab.
[02:23:32.420 --> 02:23:33.540]  I was going to ask what this was.
[02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:36.380]  Hit man and Samson. Yeah. I don't know what color,
[02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:40.220]  what color that pool is. Not sure what color. It's pretty fresh.
[02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:43.820]  It's like minty green turquoise ish. It's got a green label.
[02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:44.660]  It's got the green flame.
[02:23:44.860 --> 02:23:48.060]  I thought that was the same one you've always had. I see now it's bigger.
[02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:50.460]  That one's a little clogged.
[02:23:51.620 --> 02:23:53.300]  The other one's clogged up from the secret session.
[02:23:55.620 --> 02:23:57.900]  That was a loud right. I haven't did that one yet.
[02:23:59.460 --> 02:24:01.340]  Shout out to the secret session. Shout out to Adam mill.
[02:24:02.780 --> 02:24:04.820]  Right. I wish I could have been there next time, bro.
[02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:07.420]  Next time put yourself on the list. Send an email.
[02:24:09.740 --> 02:24:12.940]  Yeah. Yeah. I just, honestly, I don't think any of us knew it was happening.
[02:24:12.940 --> 02:24:16.420]  We were like, look at me live from the secret session. We were like, Oh,
[02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:18.460]  it's a secret. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, you know,
[02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:21.620]  we're kind of the local Pueblo guys though. You know, like you're,
[02:24:22.140 --> 02:24:26.340]  you're a little bit more of the, the, the bigger mover and shaker. We're,
[02:24:26.380 --> 02:24:29.980]  we're down here down by the river. Just, you know, Adam's just loud.
[02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:31.980]  Just recognizable. Cause I'm fucking six,
[02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:34.620]  five and have dreadlocks to my ass and everyone's like, Oh, it's that guy.
[02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:38.100]  I guess it's my thighs. Yeah. I would, I would say to you,
[02:24:38.940 --> 02:24:41.580]  almost to my knees. I tell people that I don't tell people how long they are.
[02:24:41.580 --> 02:24:44.540]  I tell them how old they are. I was like, yeah,
[02:24:44.660 --> 02:24:47.180]  the day you posted on Facebook, I was like, they were like,
[02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:49.540]  how long are they? And I was like, I don't know. They're 11 years old.
[02:24:50.420 --> 02:24:54.180]  It's like a child, bro. Right? Yeah. They're taller than some people.
[02:24:54.180 --> 02:24:57.020]  I know. It's definitely a remitment word. Yeah.
[02:24:58.540 --> 02:25:01.500]  I remember when you worked at guitar center, they were only like, yeah.
[02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:03.980]  You're exporting the bandana all the time. Nipple length.
[02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:07.060]  I had to quit rocking the bandana cause it was making my dreads grow funny.
[02:25:07.380 --> 02:25:10.020]  Like I still do it occasionally, but it was making the hair grow weird.
[02:25:10.900 --> 02:25:13.820]  I know all about that. I didn't grow funny. Yeah. Do you know, uh,
[02:25:14.060 --> 02:25:17.100]  Ryan C with dreadlocks?
[02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:19.700]  Yeah.
[02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:26.820]  I just, yeah. That dude's cool as fuck. Uh, he had dreads way before me. Um,
[02:25:26.980 --> 02:25:31.420]  I worked with him the summer he put them in and we were working up in
[02:25:31.420 --> 02:25:33.260]  Salida, put in phone lines and shit like that.
[02:25:33.860 --> 02:25:35.700]  And he kept the entire summer,
[02:25:35.780 --> 02:25:39.460]  like even when we were off work and everything kept it wrapped up in a bandana
[02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:43.420]  and everything. Nowadays he's got, they're freaking massive. I bet. Yeah.
[02:25:43.420 --> 02:25:47.860]  I probably would use him if I saw him. Oh, they get so heavy. Oh man,
[02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:49.020]  they get so heavy.
[02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:53.540]  His are thick like a smoky, you know, smoky.
[02:25:54.020 --> 02:25:56.620]  No, I do. I do.
[02:25:57.980 --> 02:26:01.460]  Probably a new smoky, but with dreadlocks. No, no, no, no, no.
[02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:03.220]  No, then it's a different smoky,
[02:26:03.340 --> 02:26:06.340]  but he is a younger Hispanic guy with a bunch of tattoos though.
[02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:09.940]  I feel like having dreadlocks is like having a child,
[02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:12.780]  but only attached to your head. Cause you have to like take care of them and
[02:26:13.140 --> 02:26:14.140]  I was born like this.
[02:26:14.140 --> 02:26:16.540]  There's only a little bit of maintenance to be done now that they're this long.
[02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:18.820]  I get them tuned up by a friend of mine about once a month.
[02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:21.460]  She does some work up on the top. There's not much to be done past year.
[02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:24.020]  There's nothing to work on. They just do this. That's what I need.
[02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:28.660]  I need that. I need that hook, you know? Yeah. The crochet hook love. Yeah.
[02:26:28.660 --> 02:26:30.500]  Yeah. Get that crochet hook in there. And yeah,
[02:26:30.540 --> 02:26:32.020]  some interlocking and some pulling.
[02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:35.060]  I just need someone to show fucking love to this. You know,
[02:26:35.060 --> 02:26:39.300]  this monstrosity up here. I'm just, I, I found a couple of people. It's just,
[02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:43.180]  then again, it's like, I don't really want you to pick it up and shoot my hair.
[02:26:43.180 --> 02:26:46.460]  So, you know, I'll show them and they're like, Oh no, honey, I'll hook you up.
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:50.620]  Just right. I'll be like, yeah, inclusion zones. I can't, you know,
[02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:54.180]  like just come over your house. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:26:54.260 --> 02:26:57.900]  Just Google it. The number of wooks. I have books here in town.
[02:26:57.980 --> 02:27:02.780]  I mean in Colorado, you'd think there's a, there'd be like a specialist,
[02:27:02.820 --> 02:27:05.860]  right? You were with me. I'm sure if you go to Facebook,
[02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:08.620]  you could find somebody like my, my friend doesn't really do.
[02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:10.940]  We went to get them chicken wings that time.
[02:27:12.100 --> 02:27:16.540]  And that white dude was like the old white bald dude was like, Oh yeah,
[02:27:16.540 --> 02:27:21.060]  my wife's dota. And he's just sitting there telling me how I should fix this and
[02:27:21.060 --> 02:27:22.340]  fix that. And I'm like,
[02:27:23.460 --> 02:27:27.820]  this old 65 year old white dude just sitting here telling me how to fix
[02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:32.260]  dreadlocks. And I'm like, sure. All right. Yeah. I swear it was me and you.
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:35.060]  I was going up there to get wings or something. I mean, it was,
[02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:38.020]  I've only ate up there with the one with you.
[02:27:38.020 --> 02:27:41.260]  So you guys still addicted to street tacos? Absolutely.
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:45.540]  Everybody leaned into Mike's enthusiasm. Yeah, dude, I found, I found,
[02:27:46.140 --> 02:27:48.700]  I found the end of the chest motion and a peace sign up with the air freshener.
[02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:53.340]  You tacos, street tacos, dog. What's your favorite place here in town? Me?
[02:27:53.660 --> 02:27:56.140]  I'm a vegetarian, but I don't think I'm a street tacos.
[02:27:56.700 --> 02:27:58.340]  I can make you some street tacos. Yeah.
[02:27:59.100 --> 02:28:00.500]  If I'm going to go get some vegan tacos,
[02:28:00.500 --> 02:28:02.980]  I think the place is called coquettes in Colorado Springs.
[02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:05.860]  A shout out to the vegan tacos or the burrowing owl.
[02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:07.860]  If you want some good vegan food. Yeah. But anyway,
[02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:10.500]  I've been with you trying to order food. It's
[02:28:12.100 --> 02:28:16.500]  the coquettes served like tofu. It was all your normal taco fixings,
[02:28:16.500 --> 02:28:19.660]  but then tofu that had been seasoned and done well.
[02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:22.180]  I don't remember exactly. I've been pretty good. I was thinking mushrooms.
[02:28:22.700 --> 02:28:26.900]  Uh, that would be cool too. I like some tofu. That's what, uh, the, uh,
[02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:30.140]  the fucking mellow mushroom. They replace all meat with that place.
[02:28:30.740 --> 02:28:35.180]  It's fucking so fire, dude. That was, that was probably the best pizza.
[02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:38.940]  I mean, it wasn't cheap for my standards, but I mean, it is in for, you know,
[02:28:38.940 --> 02:28:41.900]  like I threw it in there. So everybody at the table didn't go. Yeah.
[02:28:41.900 --> 02:28:43.180]  Cause you're a cheap pork head.
[02:28:44.460 --> 02:28:48.540]  About about a mile away from the secret sesh.
[02:28:48.580 --> 02:28:51.540]  There's a little pizza joint that I wish I could remember the fucking name of it
[02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:53.500]  because it's pointless to just talk about it and not know the name,
[02:28:53.820 --> 02:28:56.820]  but it's basically the size of the pizza joint is the size of this whole
[02:28:56.820 --> 02:28:58.980]  recording area, like this little area recording it.
[02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:02.340]  And they were playing like hardcore music, I guess. I don't,
[02:29:02.380 --> 02:29:04.620]  the dude was fucking real distorted, but kind of slow.
[02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:06.140]  The dude was mad and screaming a lot.
[02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:10.460]  I've noticed this before. Hardcore music and pizza places.
[02:29:11.980 --> 02:29:15.100]  Yeah. Well, if I had to work near that fucking hot ass oven all day,
[02:29:16.380 --> 02:29:19.900]  it's all tatted up sweaty and wearing a bandana and it's just fucking Henry
[02:29:19.900 --> 02:29:20.860]  Rollins in the background.
[02:29:21.540 --> 02:29:22.940]  It's my job.
[02:29:26.140 --> 02:29:28.820]  That would be a fucking dope pizza spot, dude. Like
[02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:31.340]  this little place was pretty, pretty bad-ass dude.
[02:29:31.340 --> 02:29:33.580]  Pizza slices were two 50 for a slice of cheese pizza.
[02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:36.260]  And then it was added topping and like certain toppings or certain prices.
[02:29:36.260 --> 02:29:37.100]  They had your basic shit.
[02:29:37.540 --> 02:29:41.380]  But the slice of pizza was like a third of fucking eighth of the pie.
[02:29:41.380 --> 02:29:43.500]  You know what I mean? It was a big ass fucking slice of pizza.
[02:29:43.780 --> 02:29:45.780]  So for two 50, I ordered three slices of pizza.
[02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:47.660]  I couldn't even eat the fucking third one. So
[02:29:47.980 --> 02:29:50.180]  that's the cheapest date I've ever heard of. Right.
[02:29:50.980 --> 02:29:54.380]  Yeah. Hey, have you tried a blackjack's
[02:29:55.100 --> 02:29:59.020]  tomato and green chili here in town? No, but I have a good friend that works there.
[02:29:59.020 --> 02:30:00.620]  So shout out to my friend at blackjack pizza.
[02:30:00.780 --> 02:30:04.220]  I got three or four friends that work there too. Oh yeah. Well, same people. Yeah.
[02:30:04.260 --> 02:30:06.820]  Well, I also know the other, one of the other delivery drivers there.
[02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:09.020]  So are we really talking about pizza? Yeah, we are.
[02:30:09.020 --> 02:30:13.500]  We got me started for high, bro. So many dabs. I got the homie at Domino's.
[02:30:13.580 --> 02:30:16.660]  Hey, yeah, you do. Hey, shout out. Shout out to Bubba.
[02:30:17.020 --> 02:30:17.860]  Yeah.
[02:30:19.060 --> 02:30:23.420]  Yeah. In Colorado. That's, that's what you got to know. You know,
[02:30:24.860 --> 02:30:28.020]  we, we got one product, they got the other, they go well together.
[02:30:28.020 --> 02:30:28.860]  That's all we're saying.
[02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:33.580]  I have a totally paid for pizza with cannabis before
[02:30:34.620 --> 02:30:38.620]  several times. I might have something lined up. Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah.
[02:30:39.060 --> 02:30:42.460]  I know. I mean, for how long you've been ordering the one place you go to all the
[02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:46.020]  time. Like I I'm sure there's been a couple of delivery drivers throughout the
[02:30:46.060 --> 02:30:50.020]  time. You're like, I'm going to pizza place that I can call and tell them who I
[02:30:50.020 --> 02:30:52.420]  am. I just be like, can I get that pizza? And they're like, Oh yeah,
[02:30:52.420 --> 02:30:55.140]  we owe you. And they just show up with pizzas. I can't talk about all that.
[02:30:55.180 --> 02:30:56.020]  I can't say who's.
[02:30:56.340 --> 02:30:59.820]  No, no, no. That's why I was discreet as well. Yeah. Is it the one that way?
[02:30:59.900 --> 02:31:01.260]  I don't know. I don't know.
[02:31:02.980 --> 02:31:04.580]  Hey, I don't look at all the doorbell rings.
[02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:06.500]  I'm going to tell you from experience that usually means yes.
[02:31:08.060 --> 02:31:10.100]  I'm just telling you that. I hate to spoil.
[02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:12.620]  Just deal with pizzas fucking free and delicious.
[02:31:13.140 --> 02:31:16.060]  Driver comes in and takes two fat dads and sets down pizzas.
[02:31:16.060 --> 02:31:19.100]  I had him a couple of bucks as a kindness, kindness, tip. Same, same deal.
[02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:23.660]  Same deal. It's back in his car and he says, text me later. Text me anytime, bro.
[02:31:24.100 --> 02:31:24.940]  I can do that.
[02:31:25.020 --> 02:31:28.860]  And ever, ever, ever since, you know, the, the hash has gotten a whole lot better.
[02:31:28.860 --> 02:31:33.540]  It definitely, that helped the game too. You know, he's like, Holy shit, bro.
[02:31:33.900 --> 02:31:35.820]  I was like, yeah, it's, it's, it's good.
[02:31:36.140 --> 02:31:37.140]  Usually on my podcast,
[02:31:37.140 --> 02:31:39.900]  I can't take big giant dads cause I get all dabbed out and can't talk.
[02:31:39.940 --> 02:31:42.460]  But there's fucking four people here. So I'm going to dab this.
[02:31:42.460 --> 02:31:43.860]  Go ahead. Dab that. I'm going to taste like,
[02:31:45.500 --> 02:31:47.740]  no, I mean, I meant I'm going to dab all of this.
[02:31:47.740 --> 02:31:50.820]  Go ahead. Dab all of that. I'll take a taste of whatever that package is.
[02:31:52.540 --> 02:31:53.380]  Take a taster.
[02:31:55.060 --> 02:31:56.220]  You're cutting into his big dab.
[02:31:57.700 --> 02:31:58.300]  Oh man.
[02:31:58.300 --> 02:32:00.420]  It was like a half a gram and now it's only like 0.3.
[02:32:01.260 --> 02:32:02.100]  You just ruined everything.
[02:32:02.100 --> 02:32:03.740]  I know I was trying to get high over here.
[02:32:06.060 --> 02:32:07.460]  Trying to do the play by play here.
[02:32:07.620 --> 02:32:08.940]  Trying to cough on a podcast.
[02:32:09.940 --> 02:32:10.860]  I don't think that's possible.
[02:32:10.900 --> 02:32:15.700]  He's got a dab that's a, it's about the size of a dime, like a little dime.
[02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:19.220]  Hey, shout out to Rasta. It kind of looks like Australia.
[02:32:21.940 --> 02:32:22.820]  He's about to smoke you.
[02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:26.580]  Sam, you need to come to the States, my friend.
[02:32:28.540 --> 02:32:29.900]  No, we need to go to him.
[02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:33.900]  I have to be here.
[02:32:34.940 --> 02:32:35.780]  You can't go anywhere.
[02:32:36.700 --> 02:32:38.820]  Everything in Australia wants to kill you.
[02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:43.820]  Well, that might be worth the risk.
[02:32:45.300 --> 02:32:45.860]  That was tasty.
[02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:46.740]  Turn your mic towards you a little bit.
[02:32:48.380 --> 02:32:50.740]  He has a problem with not talking into the mic directly.
[02:32:50.740 --> 02:32:51.980]  He's getting good at podcasting.
[02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:55.540]  Uh, he was, I think his first podcast appearance was probably my show.
[02:32:55.660 --> 02:32:55.940]  Yeah.
[02:32:56.700 --> 02:32:58.340]  He, uh, he didn't speak much.
[02:32:58.340 --> 02:33:02.620]  And when he did, he said, um, a lot as a conversation with us.
[02:33:02.620 --> 02:33:06.900]  I listened to your guys's to the Colorado podcast and he can do a show now.
[02:33:06.980 --> 02:33:07.780]  And we listen to yours.
[02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:09.460]  We actually do have real life listeners.
[02:33:09.540 --> 02:33:11.300]  Yeah, no, I listened and I told people to listen.
[02:33:11.300 --> 02:33:12.100]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:33:12.220 --> 02:33:13.140]  I definitely appreciate it.
[02:33:13.300 --> 02:33:13.540]  Yeah.
[02:33:13.540 --> 02:33:14.620]  Shout out to all of us.
[02:33:15.340 --> 02:33:16.780]  Starting to get pretty proud of the show.
[02:33:19.340 --> 02:33:21.100]  You're taking your role as kind of a leader.
[02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:23.780]  I have to thank God.
[02:33:23.900 --> 02:33:26.540]  I have to contain myself on this show and not totally just take
[02:33:26.540 --> 02:33:27.340]  control and be the leader.
[02:33:27.940 --> 02:33:30.180]  Well, you heard all her leader from the beginning there.
[02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:33.180]  I think Adam's been, I didn't know we were fucking.
[02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:38.140]  I was just playing around and seeing how it was going to work out and it
[02:33:38.140 --> 02:33:39.220]  worked fucking beautifully.
[02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:43.540]  So I just thought, by the way, I'm Jesse grows from the Colorado podcast.
[02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:45.940]  And I'm sure your mother is a wonderful lady.
[02:33:47.700 --> 02:33:49.340]  Take a fat dive and give your mom a hug.
[02:33:49.340 --> 02:33:49.580]  Right.
[02:33:51.580 --> 02:33:52.740]  Everyone's going to take the shows over.
[02:33:52.740 --> 02:33:53.980]  If you say no, no, no, no.
[02:33:53.980 --> 02:33:54.900]  It's when you say it.
[02:33:55.020 --> 02:33:55.380]  All right.
[02:33:55.460 --> 02:33:55.740]  Yeah.
[02:33:56.380 --> 02:33:56.620]  All right.
[02:33:57.220 --> 02:33:58.500]  I'm not trying to take your thunder there.
[02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:02.620]  I have a friend who claims that they are going to beat me to the intro.
[02:34:02.620 --> 02:34:04.340]  Like I'm going to memorize the whole thing and do it.
[02:34:04.460 --> 02:34:06.300]  I was like, I'll let you do it if you really want to.
[02:34:06.460 --> 02:34:07.260]  So we'll see.
[02:34:07.820 --> 02:34:09.060]  Clint, Clint tried one time.
[02:34:09.060 --> 02:34:09.820]  That was really funny.
[02:34:10.180 --> 02:34:12.340]  I bet that was notice how many times Clint's been back.
[02:34:12.460 --> 02:34:12.900]  Yeah.
[02:34:16.340 --> 02:34:18.420]  Hey, watching you do the intro is pretty impressive.
[02:34:18.420 --> 02:34:18.780]  Actually.
[02:34:19.100 --> 02:34:20.260]  I know no paper now.
[02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:21.220]  I just do it out of my head.
[02:34:21.220 --> 02:34:23.060]  All the sponsors fucking just kill it.
[02:34:23.060 --> 02:34:23.660]  I don't know.
[02:34:23.660 --> 02:34:24.740]  No, it's I do most of the pop.
[02:34:24.740 --> 02:34:27.340]  Most of my podcasts have been happening in two takes.
[02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:29.300]  I do about 15 to 20 minutes.
[02:34:29.620 --> 02:34:32.740]  I got to hit pause and take a break by then and take a drink
[02:34:32.740 --> 02:34:33.780]  and cause I'm doing it by myself.
[02:34:33.780 --> 02:34:36.020]  It's hard to talk for a fucking 20 minutes by myself.
[02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:40.260]  Uh, I think this will probably be in the one thirties, the mid one thirties.
[02:34:40.420 --> 02:34:41.460]  One 34 is up.
[02:34:41.460 --> 02:34:42.900]  This actually is a recording.
[02:34:42.900 --> 02:34:44.140]  This is labeled one 35.
[02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:46.300]  I'm not sure if it goes one 35 or one 36.
[02:34:46.980 --> 02:34:49.540]  I mean, um, 52 weeks out of the year doing one a week.
[02:34:49.540 --> 02:34:50.420]  That's yeah.
[02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:51.100]  That's impressive.
[02:34:51.180 --> 02:34:51.660]  Yeah.
[02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:56.780]  Facebook memory the other day, it was, uh, just recorded my first podcast or so.
[02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:57.300]  Nice.
[02:34:57.940 --> 02:34:58.540]  Yeah.
[02:34:58.660 --> 02:34:59.820]  That'd be about two years ago.
[02:35:00.180 --> 02:35:00.580]  That's yeah.
[02:35:00.580 --> 02:35:03.860]  This, this shows my shows a little over two years.
[02:35:03.900 --> 02:35:04.140]  Yeah.
[02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:04.580]  Yeah.
[02:35:04.580 --> 02:35:06.980]  It was just a little over, I, it was in the middle of April.
[02:35:06.980 --> 02:35:11.060]  I think it was two years around cannabis cup time or not cannabis cup time
[02:35:11.060 --> 02:35:12.460]  right before it or something.
[02:35:12.500 --> 02:35:12.620]  Yeah.
[02:35:12.620 --> 02:35:13.140]  I think so.
[02:35:13.460 --> 02:35:19.740]  Because we, you hit a, um, episode 50 right around cannabis cup time, I believe.
[02:35:19.940 --> 02:35:21.020]  Cause that would be about a year.
[02:35:21.340 --> 02:35:21.580]  Yeah.
[02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:22.060]  Right.
[02:35:22.220 --> 02:35:24.140]  It was sometimes I would do two episodes a week.
[02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:24.660]  Oh yeah.
[02:35:24.660 --> 02:35:25.100]  Yeah.
[02:35:25.100 --> 02:35:25.620]  That's right.
[02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:25.980]  That's right.
[02:35:25.980 --> 02:35:26.420]  But it's hard.
[02:35:26.700 --> 02:35:27.900]  It's hard to have that much content.
[02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:28.700]  Yeah.
[02:35:28.740 --> 02:35:29.260]  It's worth.
[02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:32.020]  And that was, that was kind of in the beginning too, you know, and it was
[02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:33.580]  kind of like, Hey, I got a podcast.
[02:35:33.580 --> 02:35:34.300]  Do you want to come be on it?
[02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:39.580]  And people were like, uh, it's like our guest the other week when I, when I
[02:35:39.580 --> 02:35:42.140]  brought fetus in, it was just like, he was my roommate and he was just kind of
[02:35:42.140 --> 02:35:46.700]  hanging out and he said, he said down and just saying that, yeah, you got a
[02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:47.580]  friend named fetus.
[02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:48.220]  Uh, yeah.
[02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:48.500]  Yeah.
[02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:53.260]  Did you see how he literally like signaled the airplane to land on the deck
[02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:55.740]  and then said, hold on one minute.
[02:35:55.740 --> 02:35:57.540]  You have a name, a friend named fetus.
[02:35:57.980 --> 02:35:58.380]  Yeah.
[02:35:58.380 --> 02:36:02.260]  He's, he's a little young, so, you know, it's like, it's like a baby type deal,
[02:36:02.260 --> 02:36:06.540]  you know, like he's, he's 18, but he's like, he's like an adopted kid that is
[02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:08.180]  allowed to hang, you know, that.
[02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:10.180]  And so he's like, you're a little wacky.
[02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:10.740]  No, no, no.
[02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:11.940]  He's not my lackey at all.
[02:36:11.940 --> 02:36:13.580]  He's just every group needs a fetus.
[02:36:13.620 --> 02:36:13.860]  Yeah.
[02:36:13.860 --> 02:36:14.340]  Every group.
[02:36:14.380 --> 02:36:14.940]  Every, every.
[02:36:15.780 --> 02:36:16.860]  It's better than Seamus.
[02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:21.020]  The nickname comes from an incident with some acid and maybe a position.
[02:36:21.140 --> 02:36:21.380]  Yeah.
[02:36:22.260 --> 02:36:27.380]  I mean, before I left the house, I literally dabbed him out so much that
[02:36:27.380 --> 02:36:30.540]  he's sitting in front of a grow tent with it on like bright as fuck with his
[02:36:30.540 --> 02:36:34.180]  hands on his, like his head or on his knees trying to go to sleep.
[02:36:35.060 --> 02:36:36.100]  Fucking six 30.
[02:36:36.100 --> 02:36:37.660]  He's fucking 18 years old, dude.
[02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:41.540]  Like he, he just can't stay awake and he'll fall asleep on the couch and just
[02:36:41.540 --> 02:36:44.580]  like curl up and it's just like, that's all the older that kid is.
[02:36:44.900 --> 02:36:45.060]  Yeah.
[02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:45.620]  He's 18.
[02:36:45.780 --> 02:36:46.060]  Yeah.
[02:36:46.100 --> 02:36:46.380]  Wow.
[02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:46.860]  Yeah.
[02:36:47.020 --> 02:36:47.420]  Yeah.
[02:36:48.020 --> 02:36:48.340]  Yeah.
[02:36:49.220 --> 02:36:49.900]  Hey, it's cool.
[02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:50.660]  He's my roommate.
[02:36:51.300 --> 02:36:53.940]  Nobody cares from your, you're from Wisconsin, bro, or whatever the fuck
[02:36:53.980 --> 02:36:57.420]  Iowa and definitely not Kelly.
[02:36:58.340 --> 02:37:01.340]  Hey, I'm fucking, I'm not saying it to you.
[02:37:01.700 --> 02:37:08.500]  Hey, you know, there's definitely worse places to be.
[02:37:09.340 --> 02:37:16.780]  I need to, um, show you guys the, uh, Mexifornia, uh, cartoon or talent.
[02:37:16.940 --> 02:37:17.860]  I don't know which one it is.
[02:37:18.580 --> 02:37:21.460]  Whichever cartoon that I watch borderlands or border.
[02:37:22.220 --> 02:37:22.900]  Yeah, I did.
[02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:23.900]  It's still, there's some in there.
[02:37:23.900 --> 02:37:24.820]  What happened there, Susan?
[02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:27.060]  I didn't want to choke on the podcast.
[02:37:27.060 --> 02:37:27.540]  Oh, okay.
[02:37:27.620 --> 02:37:28.300]  Just to leave it.
[02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:30.860]  Jeff just dabbed Australia, man.
[02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:34.700]  Yeah, that was definitely a three or 0.4.
[02:37:35.740 --> 02:37:36.140]  Ouch.
[02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:37.340]  I like to take dabs.
[02:37:37.780 --> 02:37:38.140]  All right.
[02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:38.740]  And practice.
[02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:40.060]  And then you talk afterwards.
[02:37:40.060 --> 02:37:42.380]  That's what's more amazing to anyone at the table.
[02:37:42.380 --> 02:37:44.700]  Cause we're all cigarette smokers and we're like, fuck you.
[02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:47.980]  I don't even think about it.
[02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:50.860]  Like I was at a company meeting yesterday.
[02:37:51.780 --> 02:37:52.140]  Yeah.
[02:37:52.500 --> 02:37:54.020]  This is a peek into my life.
[02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:57.700]  You guys, I was at a company meeting yesterday at the, uh, the four 20 dab
[02:37:57.700 --> 02:37:59.180]  lounge, I don't remember the real name.
[02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:01.980]  The four 20, I think it's the four 20 dab lounge.
[02:38:01.980 --> 02:38:04.980]  Most people go to golf courses or like to brunch.
[02:38:05.100 --> 02:38:05.380]  Yeah.
[02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:05.700]  Yeah.
[02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:11.060]  And the boss handed me a thing of hash and I was like, am I supposed to
[02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:13.140]  take a glob out of it or just taste it?
[02:38:13.180 --> 02:38:14.180]  And he's like, go in the middle.
[02:38:14.180 --> 02:38:15.500]  Cause everybody needs to get some.
[02:38:16.060 --> 02:38:19.100]  So I took a big fat chunk and it tastes pretty damn good.
[02:38:19.100 --> 02:38:21.060]  And then everybody watched me take like a half gram dab.
[02:38:21.620 --> 02:38:21.820]  Yeah.
[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:24.060]  So that's what our work meetings are like.
[02:38:24.060 --> 02:38:24.900]  And then we went to dinner.
[02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:26.740]  Gave me an awesome business idea.
[02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:27.100]  Yeah.
[02:38:27.940 --> 02:38:29.060]  So just host.
[02:38:29.580 --> 02:38:30.340]  Shut up, Adam.
[02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:34.620]  Aye aye, captain.
[02:38:36.620 --> 02:38:38.380]  Oh, yeah.
[02:38:38.380 --> 02:38:42.380]  I just had way too serious to be trying to, just way too busy to be trying to do
[02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:42.780]  anything.
[02:38:43.660 --> 02:38:47.540]  I had to ask if I was like, am I supposed to take like my kind of dab out of this?
[02:38:48.460 --> 02:38:50.260]  Your kind of dab out of this hash.
[02:38:50.260 --> 02:38:51.220]  Cause this ain't my hash.
[02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:52.460]  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.
[02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:55.020]  I'm sure we all seen that meme go around here recently.
[02:38:55.020 --> 02:38:57.340]  It's like, yes, I'm going to smoke all your hash.
[02:38:57.340 --> 02:38:59.140]  Like, yeah, absolutely.
[02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:00.340]  You're the person I thought of.
[02:39:00.380 --> 02:39:01.260]  Like, yeah.
[02:39:01.260 --> 02:39:02.380]  Oh, I can take a big dab.
[02:39:02.380 --> 02:39:05.020]  I've literally heard you ask, Hey man, can I get a big dab of that?
[02:39:05.020 --> 02:39:06.700]  And they're like, yeah, yeah, sure.
[02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:08.260]  And they're like piecing two pieces together.
[02:39:08.260 --> 02:39:09.060]  And they're like, no, no, no.
[02:39:09.060 --> 02:39:10.500]  Can I like that?
[02:39:10.620 --> 02:39:11.980]  That half of that piece?
[02:39:11.980 --> 02:39:12.260]  Yeah.
[02:39:12.260 --> 02:39:15.060]  Can we just hit that with something and whatever the biggest piece is.
[02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:15.740]  Can I have that?
[02:39:16.620 --> 02:39:16.940]  Yeah.
[02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:20.100]  Because, and I've seen you take it and they're like, they're sitting there with
[02:39:20.100 --> 02:39:22.100]  the job and go like, it's not bad, man.
[02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:22.860]  Tastes pretty good.
[02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:23.780]  Cool.
[02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:24.300]  Thanks bro.
[02:39:24.580 --> 02:39:25.420]  Where's who's next?
[02:39:26.180 --> 02:39:27.460]  Like, yeah, for sure.
[02:39:27.740 --> 02:39:32.700]  We're at the, one of the cannabis cups and uh, I don't even remember which one it
[02:39:32.700 --> 02:39:36.500]  was and it was hard to find a place to smoke at this, these older events that
[02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:37.980]  weren't tables and shit like there are now.
[02:39:38.580 --> 02:39:41.060]  And I finally found a place and I'm chilling out and this girl's like, Hey,
[02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:41.820]  can I join you guys?
[02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:43.460]  And so we let her fucking hang out with us of course.
[02:39:43.460 --> 02:39:44.380]  And she threw down some hash.
[02:39:44.380 --> 02:39:45.420]  He goes, here, smoke this.
[02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:47.580]  So I did, it was a good size chunk of hash.
[02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:49.620]  I thought she was kind of, kind of challenging me.
[02:39:49.660 --> 02:39:51.020]  So I picked it up and fucking dabbed it.
[02:39:51.060 --> 02:39:52.940]  She goes, dude, that was for everybody to smoke.
[02:39:54.420 --> 02:39:56.380]  You threw it down and said, here's smoke this.
[02:39:57.140 --> 02:39:59.620]  That's so reminds me of a story about.
[02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:00.620]  Evermind.
[02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:01.260]  Yeah.
[02:40:01.380 --> 02:40:01.740]  Yeah.
[02:40:01.900 --> 02:40:02.940]  Oh, censored.
[02:40:02.940 --> 02:40:04.620]  You see, look how grown up he's getting.
[02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:10.740]  Oh, you know, we haven't, we, we can have another podcast just for that kind of
[02:40:10.740 --> 02:40:11.100]  story.
[02:40:11.900 --> 02:40:12.500]  We sure do.
[02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:13.140]  We sure do.
[02:40:13.140 --> 02:40:14.900]  And we can record that story right after this.
[02:40:14.940 --> 02:40:15.780]  You want one?
[02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:22.380]  May have had something that goes up a person's nose and they down.
[02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:23.420]  That's how it all starts.
[02:40:23.540 --> 02:40:27.260]  Someone misunderstood it and thought it was for them.
[02:40:27.260 --> 02:40:29.060]  And it was for everyone.
[02:40:33.220 --> 02:40:34.180]  Florida problems.
[02:40:34.740 --> 02:40:36.420]  I've done it with LSD as well.
[02:40:36.420 --> 02:40:40.060]  So yeah, hang on to this sweet tart.
[02:40:40.060 --> 02:40:40.700]  I'm just going to eat it.
[02:40:40.740 --> 02:40:42.500]  No, that was for four people.
[02:40:42.940 --> 02:40:43.860]  This is going to be a fun night.
[02:40:45.380 --> 02:40:46.860]  That's why you're supposed to portion it out.
[02:40:46.900 --> 02:40:49.100]  I may or may not remember April.
[02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:52.660]  So that's why you don't just hand people drugs.
[02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:57.700]  That's exactly portion it out or just keep it for yourself and make it last a
[02:40:57.700 --> 02:40:58.020]  month.
[02:41:00.100 --> 02:41:01.820]  So it's funner to do with people.
[02:41:01.860 --> 02:41:02.700]  Incorrect, sir.
[02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:03.740]  Incorrect.
[02:41:03.940 --> 02:41:04.460]  Just saying.
[02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:04.980]  Yeah.
[02:41:04.980 --> 02:41:06.500]  I've been day tripping by myself before.
[02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:08.180]  That's not necessarily a bad thing.
[02:41:08.780 --> 02:41:09.500]  That's that's me.
[02:41:09.500 --> 02:41:11.780]  Usually it's like three, four o'clock in the afternoon.
[02:41:11.780 --> 02:41:12.540]  That's when I want to go.
[02:41:12.700 --> 02:41:13.180]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:41:13.180 --> 02:41:16.860]  Like I definitely, especially here with that sunset, dude, you can not trip it in
[02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:17.540]  your car all day.
[02:41:19.140 --> 02:41:20.540]  I live somewhere now.
[02:41:20.540 --> 02:41:21.060]  Okay.
[02:41:25.540 --> 02:41:26.460]  Is that road tripping?
[02:41:26.980 --> 02:41:27.260]  Yeah.
[02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:27.500]  Hey,
[02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:35.320]  that was, that was really good.
[02:41:35.320 --> 02:41:35.680]  Like,
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:38.920]  yeah, that was,
[02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:41.120]  he upgraded though.
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:44.440]  Now he's got, I got the Impala plates now.
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:46.880]  Hey, I get around
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:51.920]  silence that didn't I?
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:55.520]  Shipping's illegal, bro.
[02:41:58.200 --> 02:41:59.800]  You can GPS track me.
[02:41:59.800 --> 02:42:00.760]  I ain't going nowhere.
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:02.320]  I just happened to buy a car for cheap.
[02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:03.200]  That's from out of town.
[02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:04.200]  That's all.
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:05.320]  So that was a pretty cool ink.
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:08.640]  No, I mean, if so, I'll jump it or throw it off a cliff.
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:09.600]  I don't give a fuck.
[02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:10.680]  Like zero.
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:12.760]  How much does that fucking ankle it way?
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:13.680]  A lot.
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:14.080]  Yeah.
[02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:17.680]  So much so that they changed it from one ankle to the other today.
[02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:21.120]  It's still, there's still a mark in the other side of my ankle, like where it's
[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:21.880]  been there for a month.
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:26.040]  When they first put it on, it was so tight that it literally like you could see the
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:26.880]  little holes that
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:31.280]  yeah.
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:31.920]  You're right.
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:32.680]  You're okay.
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:33.400]  I'm good.
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:33.920]  Okay.
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:36.720]  I think Jesse might be passing.
[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:38.280]  Jesse's been dabbing more now too.
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:39.720]  Little couch is open over there.
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:42.200]  And he's taking a nap.
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:43.120]  Fucking emails.
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:43.920]  Get me every time.
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:44.840]  Yeah, it does.
[02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:45.880]  I keep my kind of hat.
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:46.760]  Yeah, you do.
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:47.200]  Yeah.
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:48.240]  I like it that way.
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:50.280]  Well, this email you kept it.
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:51.320]  You keep it a little hot.
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:53.120]  The last one he had the little pyramid one.
[02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:53.800]  Do you still got that one?
[02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:54.520]  Nah, fuck that thing.
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:42:55.120]  Really?
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:42:58.040]  I figured you would try to fix it since you have friends in places.
[02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:01.000]  Dude, that's an OG fucking nail though.
[02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:01.600]  Yeah.
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:02.120]  All right.
[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:02.400]  Whatever.
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:02.720]  Fuck it.
[02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:03.880]  Bye.
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:04.480]  Fletcher.
[02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:07.040]  It's a collector's paperweight.
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:07.480]  Yeah.
[02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:08.840]  And it blinks.
[02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:10.640]  It just doesn't heat.
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:15.720]  You could just, you could just run the other one on the floor and just have it
[02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:17.320]  up here blinking and people would never know.
[02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:19.160]  And all, and everything fried out on it.
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:22.520]  Oh, well we can get LEDs super cheap.
[02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:25.080]  It quit blinking like pretty quickly.
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:25.760]  Yeah.
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:27.840]  And then it started again though.
[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:30.000]  Then it started and then it went out.
[02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:31.440]  It wasn't a very good unit.
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:35.560]  Oh, well, I mean, it was kind of first of its kind.
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:37.000]  Yeah.
[02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:37.920]  Towards the beginning.
[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:38.960]  It was kind of a gift.
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:40.720]  I sell D nails all day.
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:44.600]  So the company that gifted it to me kind of went weird on me.
[02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:49.000]  So just avoiding all that conversation, they went Mormon first.
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:50.760]  They were Canadian.
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:55.680]  Then I had to pay taxes on it because it got sent over the border.
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:43:59.000]  Like six months later, I get a bill from the Canadian government or somebody.
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:00.200]  And I'm like, what the fuck is this about?
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:03.800]  And they're like, you owe us taxes for some $400 gift that was sent to you.
[02:44:03.800 --> 02:44:05.440]  And I was like, yeah, that's called spam.
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:05.680]  Bro.
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:11.360]  If you sent them $400, I swear to God, someone got you.
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:14.560]  They wanted to just the taxes on the 400 and I tried to ignore it twice.
[02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:16.080]  And then the letters changed colors.
[02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:18.960]  Did you know you were related to his Impablo prints too?
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:21.080]  And he's got two trunks just waiting for you.
[02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:23.560]  If you check these colors, that's when it got real.
[02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:24.120]  Yeah.
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:24.320]  Yeah.
[02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:26.400]  They went from white to yellow, then pink.
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:29.520]  It was like 16 bucks.
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:31.400]  I didn't really care that much, but okay.
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:33.400]  Was that American dollars or Canadian dollars?
[02:44:33.400 --> 02:44:34.280]  American dollars.
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:34.960]  Oh boy.
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:35.640]  They got you.
[02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:42.640]  Seems weird that I was sending it to Miami, but I mean, who knew?
[02:44:43.920 --> 02:44:45.440]  Too much of a PO box in Peru.
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:49.840]  Prince of Canada.
[02:44:53.840 --> 02:44:58.760]  Some dude has just changed his name for like two pesos and just slinging this shit all day.
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:00.480]  Yeah.
[02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:06.360]  That's the day and age we live in now to where like your spam folder is not your friend.
[02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:10.320]  Good.
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:11.000]  Thanks for that.
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:12.440]  Just leave me hanging with that.
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:13.640]  I laughed at it.
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:14.080]  I know.
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:22.840]  I get so much spam in my email accounts that like only my good shit shows or the good shit shows up in the spam account.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.480]  Now I get spam text messages.
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:26.360]  Oh yeah.
[02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:26.680]  Right.
[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:28.680]  People trying to sell me Oakley's and shit on my phone.
[02:45:28.680 --> 02:45:29.600]  I'm like, what the fuck are you?
[02:45:30.480 --> 02:45:38.080]  And if you apply for jobs, like do any of like off third party sites like Craigslist or shit like that, it's all sketch.
[02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:42.200]  They'll call you back and want you to like dial star six, seven.
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:43.640]  And it's like, I'm not dialing shit.
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:48.160]  Why would you apply for a job on a third party website?
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:51.560]  Because Craigslist is a normal place for normal poor people, Jesse.
[02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:52.920]  And I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:54.000]  We all can't use.
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:54.640]  No, no.
[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:56.520]  I thought you meant like application service.
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:45:57.480]  No, no, no, no.
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:00.040]  I mean, you can find jobs and cheap places to live.
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:01.080]  I got a job through monster.com.
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:01.560]  All right.
[02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:02.160]  Well, I understand.
[02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:02.680]  No, no, no.
[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:03.080]  Internet.
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:03.280]  I understand.
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:04.120]  It's the day of the age.
[02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:05.240]  Yeah.
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:07.120]  I misunderstood it.
[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:08.360]  Oh, my bad.
[02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:08.800]  Yeah.
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:09.640]  My bad.
[02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:12.600]  Shut the fuck up.
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:13.320]  Yeah.
[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:14.440]  Shut the fuck up, Adam.
[02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:15.160]  Shut the fuck up, Adam.
[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:15.960]  God damn, dude.
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:18.840]  Hey, let's keep it a little more positive, guys.
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:19.200]  Yeah.
[02:46:19.240 --> 02:46:19.640]  Yeah.
[02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:21.120]  For Rasta Seb's sake, at least.
[02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:22.320]  For Rasta Seb's sake.
[02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:24.360]  The most negative growth from your heart show.
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:25.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:26.600]  No, no, no, no.
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:27.800]  Grow from here.
[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:29.120]  Hey, go fuck yourself.
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:34.400]  You guys, I'm sorry.
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:35.880]  I thought this was going to be fun.
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:36.800]  No, no.
[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:40.160]  I'm the only one here having fun right now.
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:41.080]  This shit's not fun.
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:42.000]  I know you are.
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.880]  But I am amazingly fun.
[02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:49.240]  Jesse, you had like 90 dabs broke up here and there's like three left and we're all
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:51.000]  staring at it like the last pizza pizza.
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:51.800]  Some of my own shit.
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:52.600]  You guys take that one.
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:53.520]  I got my own shatter here.
[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:54.000]  There's more.
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:54.280]  I know.
[02:46:54.280 --> 02:46:55.560]  But why don't you smoke some of this?
[02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:55.960]  I did.
[02:46:55.960 --> 02:46:57.240]  I had a couple of few dabs today.
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:46:58.080]  I don't know.
[02:46:58.080 --> 02:46:58.800]  Okay, that's fine.
[02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:00.160]  I ain't trying to be a hater.
[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:02.040]  Hey, I just heard one fly across the floor.
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:02.840]  Yeah.
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:03.480]  Settle down there.
[02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:03.720]  Come on.
[02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:04.960]  That's because it's shatter.
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.320]  Quit putting your fingers all over the shatter.
[02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:08.240]  Oops.
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:08.600]  Wow.
[02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:10.080]  That was very, I am kind of hot.
[02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:12.800]  That was very, uh, uh, dude.
[02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:14.560]  Uh, I can't think of his name.
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:16.840]  Let's hear it.
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:18.120]  I want to know who you think it is.
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:18.560]  Yeah.
[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:22.400]  I'm the podcast Jew guy from fucking Joe Rogan.
[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:24.880]  Like, not Joe Rogan from church.
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:25.760]  Oh, you think it was Lisa?
[02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:26.080]  Yeah.
[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:26.640]  Yeah.
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:26.880]  Yeah.
[02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:27.440]  Okay.
[02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:27.960]  Yeah.
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:28.160]  Yeah.
[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:29.280]  You know who I'm talking to?
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:30.160]  The flying Jew.
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:30.920]  The flying Jew.
[02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:32.080]  The flying Jew.
[02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:34.560]  Hey, I watched that laugh that he does when he gets all really high.
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:41.760]  And he goes, dude, the one of him tripping on acid was the best.
[02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:43.240]  Shrooms on the last podcast.
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:47.240]  Dude, I need to watch that then because the one, them taking LSD on like the
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:50.160]  podcast and they're like, this podcast is brought to you by fucking nature box.
[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:51.760]  Yo D.
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:53.360]  Are you qualified to use that fucking?
[02:47:55.840 --> 02:47:56.360]  I don't know.
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:47:56.680]  Yeah.
[02:47:56.680 --> 02:47:57.160]  He's good.
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:47:57.720]  He's good.
[02:47:57.720 --> 02:47:59.920]  I've like readjusted his position like four times.
[02:47:59.920 --> 02:48:00.480]  Like how do I?
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:01.480]  My hands hurt.
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:02.360]  I'm sorry.
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:02.680]  I gotta like.
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:02.960]  Yeah.
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:03.440]  Oh yeah.
[02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:04.160]  I'm good.
[02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:05.720]  I could have done that for you if you like.
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:08.640]  I mean, I would have been, I would absolutely be capable.
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:09.200]  All right.
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:10.840]  Well then do your damn self then.
[02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:12.040]  Yeah.
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:13.240]  There's positivity for you.
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:18.080]  All Jeff is now put the microphone against his forehead and yeah.
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:20.960]  See, this is the thing that video just would shine through, you know, for
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:21.960]  these special episodes.
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:22.320]  Oh yeah.
[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:22.640]  Video.
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:23.800]  This show would be ridiculous.
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:24.200]  It would be.
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:24.320]  Yeah.
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:24.920]  That'd be fun.
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:25.400]  Yeah.
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:28.640]  I don't think it's fair that some people would be able to see it on video.
[02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:31.000]  We'd abandoned some people and we started talking about video.
[02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:32.800]  You did it for YouTube for a little while.
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:33.560]  He's like, I gave up on that.
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:34.560]  Like pictures and stuff.
[02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:36.040]  You got to like episode 20 or something.
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:37.040]  That takes so much time.
[02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:37.280]  No.
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:37.480]  Yeah.
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:41.240]  Well, if they don't have a really fast render process for just audio.
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:43.320]  No, it's just me making the videos for damn ever.
[02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:43.760]  Yeah.
[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:44.880]  For damn ever.
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:46.840]  Hellfire.
[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:47.520]  Hellfire.
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:48.240]  Damnation.
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:49.720]  It took a long tarnation time.
[02:48:49.720 --> 02:48:50.640]  Damn fire.
[02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:51.120]  Woo.
[02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:56.160]  So I had never started a Colorado dope show without, if I'd had never been on
[02:48:56.160 --> 02:49:00.240]  your show, so that was something I was wanting to bring up tonight and some
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:04.920]  serious on a serious note, I didn't have one little subject I thought we could do.
[02:49:04.920 --> 02:49:05.280]  Maybe.
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:08.520]  And then I'll blame part of my show on like Tim Martin.
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:09.640]  Shout out to Tim Martin.
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:12.240]  He took a break and there needed to be a podcast.
[02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:13.200]  Not Tim Ryan Acker.
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:14.320]  Just no, no.
[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:14.520]  No.
[02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:15.200]  No radio.
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:15.560]  Yeah.
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:16.480]  Tim Martin, JDR.
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:17.840]  Way back in the day.
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:19.840]  I'm poking again.
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:20.720]  I'm like,
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:24.400]  I'm a little bit of Danny Danko show kind of inspired this.
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:24.880]  Yeah.
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:27.720]  And then, uh, the Adam Dunn show, of course.
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:28.000]  Yeah.
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:30.040]  But then, uh, Adam Hill for sure.
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:31.800]  I've never listened to that one.
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:34.160]  Whoa.
[02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:37.640]  The fade out.
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:39.720]  That might control.
[02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:42.560]  For sure.
[02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:49.480]  I like the, uh, survivalist show, uh, non non cannabis podcast.
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:49.960]  Oh, okay.
[02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:50.360]  All right.
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:50.480]  Yeah.
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:53.240]  Well, what other podcasts do you listen to?
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:56.520]  Uh, of course everyone at the table, this is the fucking Joe Rogan, right?
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:04.520]  Uh, I listened to Joey Coco Diaz more than Joe Rogan, just because Joe Rogan, it
[02:50:04.520 --> 02:50:06.360]  seems like he has three of my week and bro, I don't know.
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:07.920]  How the fuck do you do that?
[02:50:07.960 --> 02:50:11.600]  Like I drive an hour or two in front of him and then I work in a grower.
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:13.960]  I stick one earbud in one ear and just go to fucking work.
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:15.960]  Have you ever heard of a unpopular opinion?
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:17.120]  No, but I should listen to it.
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:18.400]  It sounds like, yeah, check them out.
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:18.960]  They're funny.
[02:50:19.320 --> 02:50:19.640]  Word.
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:20.040]  I will.
[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:20.560]  I like them.
[02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:23.280]  Uh, it's from there from cracked.com.
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:24.280]  I don't know if you ever heard of that.
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:24.600]  Yeah.
[02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:24.920]  Yeah.
[02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:26.720]  I like Doug Stanhope's podcast.
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:27.360]  Ironically.
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:30.960]  Uh, they just sit around and get drunk and take Adderall and talk shit.
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:33.000]  I've heard about that.
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:33.200]  Yeah.
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:34.640]  It's, it's pretty fucking good.
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:38.880]  It's a, the Doug Stanhope shot clock podcast for the guy's name that does
[02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:40.680]  that one because I'm too high, right?
[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:41.520]  Listen to this.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:47.600]  I mean, no, I mean, when you forget, listen, it's a reminder of all of those.
[02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:49.200]  We all like stare at him.
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:52.520]  Like, no, I can't remember the host.
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:53.600]  Yeah.
[02:50:53.640 --> 02:50:55.600]  Like, wait, did I miss something?
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:56.600]  I listen to this.
[02:50:57.400 --> 02:50:57.760]  No, no, no.
[02:50:57.760 --> 02:50:59.760]  Listen, are we talking about this right now?
[02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:01.160]  Or are we talking about this right now?
[02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:01.760]  Later?
[02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:07.760]  Hey Jeff, listen to the podcast called this bro.
[02:51:08.160 --> 02:51:08.840]  This bro.
[02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:09.480]  Nevermind.
[02:51:09.480 --> 02:51:10.960]  We're fucking with our future selves.
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:11.240]  Yeah.
[02:51:11.840 --> 02:51:12.920]  We have to go back to the future.
[02:51:12.920 --> 02:51:13.560]  I'm traveling.
[02:51:13.560 --> 02:51:13.880]  Shit.
[02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:14.600]  Be careful.
[02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:16.520]  We might be sent back to stop Donald Trump.
[02:51:17.880 --> 02:51:21.560]  See how that, yeah, I just rolled all that in the whole podcast.
[02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:25.840]  No, this is a three podcast and a release brought up the 13 monkeys
[02:51:25.840 --> 02:51:27.160]  thing, 13 monkeys thing.
[02:51:27.200 --> 02:51:28.200]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:30.080]  No, I believe it.
[02:51:30.320 --> 02:51:30.840]  I have reason.
[02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:31.400]  Well monkeys.
[02:51:32.040 --> 02:51:33.160]  Is that really what it is?
[02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:36.080]  There's only 12 monkeys, but yeah.
[02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:37.120]  The head in the box.
[02:51:37.120 --> 02:51:38.960]  Is that the, that's that thing you're talking about?
[02:51:39.040 --> 02:51:39.800]  Is that the movie?
[02:51:40.720 --> 02:51:41.920]  Am I getting, where did you just go?
[02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:42.280]  Yeah.
[02:51:42.280 --> 02:51:42.640]  I don't know.
[02:51:42.640 --> 02:51:43.600]  I'm lost.
[02:51:43.720 --> 02:51:44.320]  What's your time?
[02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:45.320]  You two were talking about it.
[02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:46.280]  I don't know this.
[02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:48.400]  Have you ever seen 12 monkeys?
[02:51:48.560 --> 02:51:49.320]  With Bruce Willis?
[02:51:49.760 --> 02:51:50.360]  No.
[02:51:50.840 --> 02:51:55.280]  He gets sent back to the, uh, yeah, that's the movie I'm thinking of with
[02:51:55.280 --> 02:51:56.480]  the fucking, the head in the box.
[02:51:56.480 --> 02:51:56.840]  Right.
[02:51:56.960 --> 02:51:57.640]  Is that what?
[02:51:57.720 --> 02:51:58.920]  No, that's seven.
[02:51:59.360 --> 02:52:00.000]  Okay.
[02:52:00.080 --> 02:52:00.360]  All right.
[02:52:00.360 --> 02:52:02.000]  So a fucking number of monkeys.
[02:52:02.040 --> 02:52:02.920]  Fuck you guys.
[02:52:02.920 --> 02:52:07.200]  You know, like it could have been any fucking chair when I said Brad Pitt, he
[02:52:07.200 --> 02:52:08.480]  was like three feet in the air.
[02:52:08.480 --> 02:52:08.760]  Yeah.
[02:52:08.760 --> 02:52:10.720]  Like somebody related to me that guy.
[02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:12.040]  That's what the fuck I'm talking about.
[02:52:12.040 --> 02:52:13.400]  Who put the fucking head in the box?
[02:52:13.440 --> 02:52:13.720]  All right.
[02:52:13.760 --> 02:52:14.120]  Whatever.
[02:52:14.120 --> 02:52:14.880]  It was in seven.
[02:52:15.040 --> 02:52:15.720]  It's all right.
[02:52:16.280 --> 02:52:18.120]  Who gives a fuck about how many monkeys you got?
[02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:19.520]  And I don't care how many boxes.
[02:52:19.960 --> 02:52:20.200]  All right.
[02:52:20.240 --> 02:52:21.240]  Well, just watch the movie.
[02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:22.880]  Then I'll watch it tonight.
[02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:24.920]  But is that weird that I don't.
[02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:26.920]  All right, cool.
[02:52:27.120 --> 02:52:27.440]  Weird.
[02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:30.800]  Oh my God.
[02:52:30.840 --> 02:52:31.720]  Adam, you're fired.
[02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:32.720]  What did you just do?
[02:52:32.880 --> 02:52:35.120]  I dropped, I dropped butane.
[02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:36.760]  I can't believe you knocked over a can.
[02:52:36.760 --> 02:52:38.680]  Everybody fucking relax.
[02:52:40.040 --> 02:52:42.800]  There are thousands of dollars in glass on this table and you knocked over a
[02:52:42.800 --> 02:52:44.600]  three pound can of butane.
[02:52:44.640 --> 02:52:45.000]  You know what?
[02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:45.520]  Fuck.
[02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:45.840]  I.
[02:52:49.520 --> 02:52:50.440]  Dig a fire.
[02:52:53.640 --> 02:52:54.800]  It's hellfire boy.
[02:52:55.160 --> 02:52:56.480]  D you should have brought the soundboard.
[02:52:56.640 --> 02:52:56.880]  All right.
[02:52:59.080 --> 02:53:00.360]  I didn't even break your butane.
[02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:01.720]  My butane fine.
[02:53:02.760 --> 02:53:04.320]  Did you just try to do air horn?
[02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:06.280]  I need no air horn sign.
[02:53:06.280 --> 02:53:08.400]  Like they used to have the no stairway sign to the guitar store.
[02:53:08.920 --> 02:53:09.920]  I need the no.
[02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:13.440]  You get a no air horn sign?
[02:53:13.440 --> 02:53:13.800]  I like your air horn.
[02:53:13.800 --> 02:53:16.360]  I'm going to have an air horn in my pocket every time I come over here.
[02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:17.920]  Like it's happening.
[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:19.040]  Like a little tiny.
[02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:20.320]  Uh huh.
[02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:20.720]  Yeah.
[02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:21.960]  Do it.
[02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:22.680]  Get a sign.
[02:53:22.760 --> 02:53:23.320]  See what happens.
[02:53:24.280 --> 02:53:25.280]  You keep making rules.
[02:53:25.280 --> 02:53:26.000]  I keep breaking them.
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:27.360]  That's the way the system works, buddy.
[02:53:35.400 --> 02:53:36.960]  I guess we're not getting invited back.
[02:53:39.600 --> 02:53:40.240]  I love this.
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:41.760]  Hey Adam.
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:44.000]  We're not taking you anywhere with us.
[02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:45.840]  This is why you can't take me anywhere with you.
[02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:47.120]  This is the prime example.
[02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:50.720]  We're going to walk out of here and both of you are going to like whip off the belt.
[02:53:50.720 --> 02:53:54.280]  Just fucking stupid, dumb redneck.
[02:53:54.280 --> 02:53:56.040]  Go home and think about what you did.
[02:53:56.080 --> 02:53:57.200]  Don't listen to anything.
[02:53:57.240 --> 02:53:58.880]  We'll save the beating for the next episode.
[02:53:58.920 --> 02:53:59.200]  All right.
[02:53:59.200 --> 02:53:59.600]  It's cool.
[02:53:59.640 --> 02:54:00.320]  We'll get it on tape.
[02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:00.920]  Exactly.
[02:54:00.960 --> 02:54:01.680]  Yeah.
[02:54:01.800 --> 02:54:02.000]  Yeah.
[02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:03.520]  Well, let's just end this one and start that.
[02:54:03.520 --> 02:54:04.200]  Cause it'll be fun.
[02:54:05.240 --> 02:54:05.440]  All right.
[02:54:05.440 --> 02:54:07.320]  Now we're beating his ass in the garage.
[02:54:07.320 --> 02:54:07.960]  Part two.
[02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.080]  Jeff's got the mobile recording device out.
[02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:11.480]  Hey, we'll do video.
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:13.160]  We're live on Periscope.
[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:13.880]  Beating animals.
[02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:17.560]  I can take a punch, you know, maybe not from one of you big guys.
[02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:22.640]  I'm not saying he can't hit hard, but yeah, you got a broken hand, so you can't
[02:54:22.640 --> 02:54:23.520]  hit me hard with your left hand.
[02:54:24.520 --> 02:54:26.760]  Hey, I'm just saying, I bet I could take one of your left.
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:27.400]  Do you understand?
[02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:28.640]  I'm like, Oh yeah.
[02:54:28.920 --> 02:54:30.800]  Hey, you want to take one of my left?
[02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:32.200]  No, no.
[02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:33.160]  You're yeah.
[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:35.320]  You, we all know your past.
[02:54:35.880 --> 02:54:38.960]  I'm not saying that that Jeff wouldn't be just as equal, but you know, at least
[02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:39.480]  he's skinny.
[02:54:39.480 --> 02:54:40.160]  You're fucking.
[02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:40.680]  Yeah.
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:41.200]  Yeah.
[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:43.000]  You could probably just go like that.
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:46.440]  Well, one in front of me, he's a stop.
[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:46.880]  My mother.
[02:54:47.680 --> 02:54:48.160]  For sure.
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:52.720]  No, I tried not to piss you off at every point in turn.
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:54.920]  I'm just like, cause I've seen you bad.
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:54:57.160]  You're who I call when I can't handle the shit.
[02:54:57.160 --> 02:54:57.440]  Right.
[02:54:57.440 --> 02:54:57.680]  Right.
[02:55:00.520 --> 02:55:01.400]  Jesse's pretty weak.
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:05.000]  Thanks D positivity all the way.
[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:05.360]  Yeah.
[02:55:05.880 --> 02:55:08.960]  Well, I've thrown him down a couple of times, so I might be skinny.
[02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:09.720]  What?
[02:55:09.720 --> 02:55:10.640]  When he gets tired.
[02:55:11.320 --> 02:55:12.480]  Would you like to tell the story?
[02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:12.760]  Yeah.
[02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:14.080]  Why don't you tell your side of the story?
[02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:14.360]  Okay.
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:16.680]  Face is totally different than it was five minutes ago.
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:19.240]  Oh, he got, who's going down in the garage now?
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:22.040]  I mean, he could probably pick me.
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:24.680]  The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club.
[02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:24.960]  Yeah.
[02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:25.520]  Me.
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:27.560]  And I was like, no, I'm not going to hit you.
[02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:30.040]  As soon as he hit me that I could have just spoken up.
[02:55:30.040 --> 02:55:34.040]  No, but I'm not stupid, but I did throw you to the ground and I did pin you.
[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:35.240]  Eat that Rasta, Seb.
[02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:38.440]  Fight, fight, fight.
[02:55:38.560 --> 02:55:39.640]  Fight, fight, fight.
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:40.640]  Kiss, kiss, kiss.
[02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:42.840]  My listeners are like, what happened to Jeff's shoulder?
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:44.800]  We got him tied up to the basement down.
[02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:46.360]  No, for sure.
[02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:47.880]  Held his drums hostage.
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:48.960]  Everybody loves each other.
[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:51.480]  It's just, I mean, it's like a brotherly type love.
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:52.720]  I mean, yeah.
[02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:52.960]  Yeah.
[02:55:52.960 --> 02:55:55.800]  No, I've totally had to throw one of my best friends down to the snow and rub
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:55:56.880]  ice in his fucking face.
[02:55:56.880 --> 02:55:59.680]  With that fucking gang of fools you hang out with.
[02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:00.440]  I bet dude.
[02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:04.160]  You have one dude that literally thinks he's fucking coming into the room and
[02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:06.120]  jumping onto the top rope at any time.
[02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:07.480]  Like shout out John Randolph.
[02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:08.480]  Shout out John Randolph.
[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:13.160]  Like for real, that dude is live and in charge all the time.
[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:14.760]  So he's, he's coolest shit.
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:16.200]  That's my, that's a, that's my trim dude.
[02:56:16.200 --> 02:56:19.440]  He trims fucking seven hours a day, eight hours a day with me, dude.
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:19.920]  Seriously.
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:23.720]  Seven hours a day and screams like I do probably the other hour of the day.
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:27.200]  I chopped down trees and bring them out to the room and weigh them and then
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:28.360]  fucking hand them to Randolph's.
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:30.920]  And then by the end of the day, I got a pile of trim buds, dude.
[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:31.920]  It's fucking amazing.
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:33.040]  I'm shout out to that kid.
[02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:36.560]  I still want more of those episodes of them and like all just sitting around
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:40.880]  kicking it, singing like bullshit and Oh, with the turpy boys, boys, boys.
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:42.920]  Do you do metric stuff ever?
[02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:43.240]  Yeah.
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:44.240]  I do metric all day long.
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:44.440]  Yeah.
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:46.360]  What'd you think of their cute little message?
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:47.080]  Oh yeah.
[02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:47.920]  Metric went down.
[02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:50.480]  I was going to talk about that on a normal, on a normal episode of my show,
[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:51.080]  but this is good.
[02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:55.520]  A metric went down, uh, for like fucking six hours, dude.
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:57.680]  And you couldn't do anything.
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:02.120]  So if nothing you couldn't, yeah, you pretty much could sit around on the
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:05.360]  retail end because I think they use MMJ menu on the retail end so they could do
[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:05.560]  that.
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:09.680]  The retail worked fine, but any of the grow we had, we were packaging a transfer,
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:12.480]  uh, and a large transfer.
[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:14.720]  Like we're in the middle of a hefty harvest.
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:17.520]  I don't even want to talk about how much are we were packaging, but we're making
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:18.520]  lots of packages.
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:21.760]  It took me and another dude fucking a couple hours to put all these packages
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:22.160]  together.
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:24.560]  Like, so we put all the packages together.
[02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:25.600]  They're weighed, they're in bags.
[02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:26.720]  We got the marker written on them.
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:29.840]  When we go to do it in the computer and metric says, sorry, we're down.
[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:32.520]  Like we can do shit.
[02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:32.840]  Yeah.
[02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:33.160]  Ouch.
[02:57:33.720 --> 02:57:35.000]  I can't quote it with this.
[02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:36.840]  But in a stupid little message,
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:41.960]  but then it came back up the next day and it's like, uh, we've had our, uh, yeah.
[02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:47.080]  Had her buds have been working or we've been working our buds off to get things
[02:57:47.080 --> 02:57:49.240]  back smoking again or something like that.
[02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:52.280]  And they tried to be cute about it and they apologize, but they definitely tried
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:52.800]  to be witty.
[02:57:52.880 --> 02:57:58.240]  Do you guys get that wrote from a dispensary out and, and Peter or what?
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:02.440]  Just sounds something cliche like they would do.
[02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:05.280]  I have a, I'm not, I'm not going to drop any names.
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:06.480]  I have one.
[02:58:06.480 --> 02:58:06.680]  It is.
[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:07.800]  We wouldn't send anyone there.
[02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:10.680]  I had a screenshot.
[02:58:10.680 --> 02:58:11.760]  I just must find, Whoa.
[02:58:12.200 --> 02:58:14.040]  Um, no, maybe I don't have a screenshot of it.
[02:58:14.760 --> 02:58:17.600]  That's pretty sure I got a screenshot of that, but it's, I was a
[02:58:18.120 --> 02:58:19.520]  rise of a dog star.
[02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:21.680]  I was tagging plants.
[02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:24.080]  Just cut down on that.
[02:58:24.320 --> 02:58:25.240]  That one was for you.
[02:58:25.840 --> 02:58:27.480]  You didn't think I was ruining anything.
[02:58:27.480 --> 02:58:28.000]  There you go.
[02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:31.400]  Oh my God.
[02:58:32.880 --> 02:58:33.680]  You're ridiculous.
[02:58:34.120 --> 02:58:34.640]  Yeah.
[02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:35.880]  Yeah.
[02:58:37.480 --> 02:58:38.280]  Torching it up.
[02:58:38.680 --> 02:58:38.960]  Yep.
[02:58:39.200 --> 02:58:40.600]  This is what Adam does on our show.
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:43.600]  Also hold that torch closer to the microphone.
[02:58:45.320 --> 02:58:52.000]  You told D you know what, you know what happened to your face when you said
[02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.280]  that, I think we need to give Adam his own show.
[02:58:55.120 --> 02:58:55.920]  What are we going to call it?
[02:58:55.920 --> 02:58:57.800]  It's called the fuck off the fuck.
[02:58:59.000 --> 02:58:59.680]  I don't think I tunes.
[02:59:00.640 --> 02:59:01.000]  No, no.
[02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:01.960]  We'll do it with Asterix.
[02:59:01.960 --> 02:59:02.640]  It's fine.
[02:59:03.880 --> 02:59:04.560]  That would work.
[02:59:04.640 --> 02:59:05.960]  Crooked trailer podcast.
[02:59:07.440 --> 02:59:08.320]  44 minutes.
[02:59:08.760 --> 02:59:10.480]  Uh, what'd you call your hairstyle?
[02:59:12.120 --> 02:59:13.360]  Bullocks podcast.
[02:59:13.400 --> 02:59:13.680]  Yeah.
[02:59:13.760 --> 02:59:15.200]  The Bullocks 44.
[02:59:15.440 --> 02:59:15.800]  Yeah.
[02:59:16.080 --> 02:59:17.000]  More like 44.
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:17.400]  What do you want?
[02:59:18.360 --> 02:59:18.560]  Yeah.
[02:59:19.560 --> 02:59:24.440]  That's the, uh, highly educated titanium fucking nail with that thing is dish
[02:59:24.440 --> 02:59:25.560]  on taller dude.
[02:59:25.560 --> 02:59:27.200]  That thing is so dope.
[02:59:27.240 --> 02:59:28.920]  Ooh, your dad's going to taste so good.
[02:59:30.680 --> 02:59:31.040]  Here you go.
[02:59:31.040 --> 02:59:31.400]  I'm sorry.
[02:59:31.480 --> 02:59:31.640]  Yeah.
[02:59:31.640 --> 02:59:32.240]  Quartz on top.
[02:59:32.240 --> 02:59:35.960]  It's a little dirty because I take the lab, so it needs a little heat to it.
[02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:40.120]  But once you put some heat on it, I thought that was just like titanium.
[02:59:40.120 --> 02:59:45.280]  Or just do, I mean, I hit him fairly the same with the torch pointed at it.
[02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:47.680]  Pretty simple there.
[02:59:47.680 --> 02:59:47.960]  Jesse.
[02:59:47.960 --> 02:59:52.040]  See, when I asked this question earlier, I got so much shit from everybody, but
[02:59:52.040 --> 02:59:53.800]  you see how these two assholes just gave you shit.
[02:59:53.800 --> 02:59:57.440]  And I said nothing because I've already been down that road and I was that
[02:59:57.440 --> 02:59:59.040]  asshole getting shit talked about.
[02:59:59.040 --> 02:59:59.520]  But it's cool.
[02:59:59.680 --> 03:00:00.040]  It's fine.
[03:00:00.200 --> 03:00:02.400]  You know, I'm your friend.
[03:00:02.400 --> 03:00:03.080]  Don't feel jealous.
[03:00:03.160 --> 03:00:03.560]  I'm not.
[03:00:04.360 --> 03:00:04.680]  What's that?
[03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:05.120]  Jealousy.
[03:00:05.240 --> 03:00:05.920]  I don't fucking know.
[03:00:05.920 --> 03:00:06.560]  It's just jealousy.
[03:00:06.560 --> 03:00:07.080]  Don't worry about it.
[03:00:09.560 --> 03:00:10.440]  You're trying to be a cool kid.
[03:00:10.440 --> 03:00:11.160]  It's not fit, man.
[03:00:11.160 --> 03:00:11.840]  Absolutely.
[03:00:11.880 --> 03:00:12.520]  I'm sorry.
[03:00:12.680 --> 03:00:15.520]  You've been went and bought yourself a bunch of absolutely.
[03:00:15.880 --> 03:00:16.360]  All right.
[03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:18.360]  I got a couple for free, but yeah, absolutely.
[03:00:18.560 --> 03:00:20.800]  Well, I paid for a lot of them.
[03:00:20.840 --> 03:00:22.040]  I can just put it on my checks.
[03:00:22.080 --> 03:00:23.000]  The hat is the nicest.
[03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:24.120]  I never even see the money.
[03:00:24.240 --> 03:00:28.440]  So yeah, there's literally an, you know, I can't first rule by fight club.
[03:00:28.480 --> 03:00:29.040]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:00:30.280 --> 03:00:32.360]  Your head is like the nicest part of your apparel.
[03:00:32.400 --> 03:00:33.040]  Absolutely.
[03:00:33.040 --> 03:00:35.160]  And my shirt that I got for free from, from Jesse.
[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:35.720]  So I mean,
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:37.880]  shout out to easy clone.
[03:00:37.880 --> 03:00:39.360]  I fucking rock the easy clone.
[03:00:39.560 --> 03:00:41.800]  I've got a four fucking table.
[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:45.400]  That picture you showed me was what picture monsters those roots.
[03:00:45.680 --> 03:00:46.040]  Damn roots.
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:46.400]  Damn roots.
[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:46.880]  So easy.
[03:00:46.880 --> 03:00:47.560]  Clone of roots.
[03:00:47.600 --> 03:00:48.200]  No, easy.
[03:00:49.880 --> 03:00:50.800]  Easy clone of roots.
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:53.920]  I, uh, a little bit of a rapid start.
[03:00:54.480 --> 03:00:54.680]  Okay.
[03:00:54.680 --> 03:00:56.000]  A little bit of B.
[03:00:56.520 --> 03:00:56.840]  All right.
[03:00:56.960 --> 03:00:58.880]  And an easy cloner and an easy cloner.
[03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:01.480]  But I put an air pump in my easy clone.
[03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:04.600]  I put a little air pump, put a little circulation going on air pump.
[03:01:04.600 --> 03:01:05.560]  So it doesn't get stale.
[03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:06.240]  Bubbly bubbles.
[03:01:06.240 --> 03:01:06.640]  Boobily.
[03:01:06.640 --> 03:01:07.720]  Get that terp going on.
[03:01:07.720 --> 03:01:07.960]  Get it.
[03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:08.720]  Boobily boobily.
[03:01:08.760 --> 03:01:09.040]  Get it.
[03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:10.240]  A bit of the little, the little, the little, the little.
[03:01:12.960 --> 03:01:14.000]  Dang man.
[03:01:15.280 --> 03:01:16.640]  The more air, the better in your cloner.
[03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:18.200]  That makes sense.
[03:01:18.320 --> 03:01:19.040]  Get it frothy.
[03:01:19.720 --> 03:01:20.080]  Frothy.
[03:01:20.080 --> 03:01:22.760]  That thing hits like, like there's no water in it.
[03:01:23.120 --> 03:01:23.480]  Yeah.
[03:01:23.480 --> 03:01:24.280]  It's so smooth.
[03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:26.240]  It's like it's a dry hit, but there's water.
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:27.760]  It's because there's hardly any water.
[03:01:27.800 --> 03:01:27.960]  Yeah.
[03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:29.840]  It's literally right above the second percoline.
[03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:33.480]  We've dabbed so hard that the water just kind of, yeah, you can see the old.
[03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:34.480]  The old water.
[03:01:35.800 --> 03:01:36.080]  Here.
[03:01:36.800 --> 03:01:37.520]  God damn it.
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:37.920]  Derek.
[03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:39.720]  I'm not the only one.
[03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:43.840]  It's because of my broken hand.
[03:01:44.160 --> 03:01:44.480]  Yeah.
[03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:44.680]  Yeah.
[03:01:44.680 --> 03:01:46.080]  Don't forget to heat this up for me.
[03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:47.520]  Torch off your plastic.
[03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:48.320]  Yeah.
[03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:50.040]  I, I, yeah, you bet.
[03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:52.640]  It's got a little lump of bottle on there.
[03:01:54.360 --> 03:01:55.360]  It's going to drip on your jeans.
[03:01:55.360 --> 03:01:56.320]  It's like that, bro.
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:01:59.640]  They're dripping onto, uh, here this Turpex packaging.
[03:01:59.680 --> 03:01:59.960]  Okay.
[03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:00.120]  Yeah.
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:01.360]  Your parchment's right there.
[03:02:04.560 --> 03:02:05.280]  Is that big enough?
[03:02:06.040 --> 03:02:08.160]  It's got a little dab left on it, but Colorado problems.
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:10.880]  Whoa.
[03:02:10.880 --> 03:02:12.240]  Hi, I'm right over here.
[03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:15.160]  So we're going to do this on podcast.
[03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:16.000]  I mean, why not?
[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:21.360]  You know, like, uh, if you hear the smoke detector, if you're the smoke detector,
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:24.040]  that's just, it's not going to melt it off there.
[03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:24.960]  Yeah.
[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:25.720]  Heat the shit out of it.
[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:26.440]  Sounds like glowing.
[03:02:27.480 --> 03:02:31.520]  And then, yeah, I guess you know, the Turpex containers would be plastic too.
[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:33.320]  So this is going to be vapor on there.
[03:02:33.320 --> 03:02:33.840]  So it's cool.
[03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:38.480]  You're trying to drip it onto a zigzag, bro.
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:40.960]  Basically zigzags.
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:41.680]  They're not zigzags.
[03:02:41.680 --> 03:02:45.320]  There, there's some other shitty papers that you're trying to pawn off.
[03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:46.480]  I wasn't trying to pawn off.
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:50.840]  I gave a couple of my friends samples of some papers that someone pawned off on me.
[03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:51.640]  All right.
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:55.240]  I was just trying to be nice and see what you thought about them because I have at
[03:02:55.240 --> 03:02:56.560]  least a, I like the packaging.
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:02:57.280]  Am I right?
[03:02:57.360 --> 03:02:58.800]  Like, did you get a look?
[03:02:58.800 --> 03:03:00.320]  Cause you can get a quality picture on that.
[03:03:00.440 --> 03:03:01.880]  Well, yeah, but I mean, come on.
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:07.480]  When do you get papers with, with it's like listening to Mandarin or I was just
[03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:12.440]  going to, I was just going to ask you how much fucking fucking energy drink did
[03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:12.880]  you drink?
[03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:13.920]  Nothing, man.
[03:03:13.920 --> 03:03:15.320]  I like being around my friends.
[03:03:15.320 --> 03:03:16.200]  I don't understand.
[03:03:16.200 --> 03:03:20.680]  Like, fuck, you know, like just to hang out with these two bucks is one thing like
[03:03:20.680 --> 03:03:24.880]  together, but then like, you're always so busy now that you know, eventually,
[03:03:24.920 --> 03:03:27.760]  eventually does he just sound like Panja when he talks?
[03:03:27.760 --> 03:03:28.120]  Yeah.
[03:03:28.520 --> 03:03:31.360]  He's literally walked in and out of the room and I've just kept walking and
[03:03:31.360 --> 03:03:31.720]  talking.
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:32.280]  And so have you.
[03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:33.120]  I don't want to hear that shit.
[03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:35.200]  I don't want to hear it.
[03:03:35.520 --> 03:03:37.560]  He'll be talking and he'll be saying something that suddenly it's your
[03:03:37.560 --> 03:03:38.400]  ability to deal with it.
[03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:40.680]  We're down there to be literally new.
[03:03:41.560 --> 03:03:46.360]  I mean, I got to figure out like his different pitches and tones.
[03:03:46.440 --> 03:03:46.600]  Yeah.
[03:03:46.640 --> 03:03:48.680]  Like I'm not a whale asshole.
[03:03:51.160 --> 03:03:53.440]  Just put them in a mix and just play music underneath them.
[03:03:54.200 --> 03:03:55.400]  What key you rambling in?
[03:03:58.640 --> 03:03:59.200]  Damn it.
[03:03:59.200 --> 03:04:01.600]  See, that'd be funnier than you guys doing a rap song.
[03:04:03.080 --> 03:04:06.320]  Dude, you can absolutely, I'll give you everything you need and dare to cane.
[03:04:06.360 --> 03:04:08.040]  Like, Oh, stay a while.
[03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:10.840]  Listen, like I'll give you exactly what you need, dude.
[03:04:11.040 --> 03:04:12.120]  Just, you gotta let me know.
[03:04:12.240 --> 03:04:15.880]  It's scary when Adam tells you, I'll give you exactly what you need all over the
[03:04:15.880 --> 03:04:16.520]  microphone.
[03:04:16.520 --> 03:04:17.360]  Don't give a fuck.
[03:04:17.560 --> 03:04:18.160]  Zero.
[03:04:19.560 --> 03:04:20.560]  Somebody, it's funny.
[03:04:20.560 --> 03:04:22.920]  The other week, uh, Jesse was saying something.
[03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:27.360]  I was giving somebody shit like, Oh, you don't need to say that on blah, blah,
[03:04:27.360 --> 03:04:27.880]  blah, blah, blah.
[03:04:27.880 --> 03:04:28.520]  Social media.
[03:04:28.520 --> 03:04:29.640]  And I was like, I don't give a fuck.
[03:04:30.200 --> 03:04:31.200]  My nickname 44.
[03:04:31.200 --> 03:04:32.160]  I don't give a zero fucks.
[03:04:32.360 --> 03:04:34.280]  And he's like, Oh, you talk all this big shit online.
[03:04:34.280 --> 03:04:36.840]  And Jesse chimes in with, no, that's really him.
[03:04:39.880 --> 03:04:40.280]  No, no, no.
[03:04:40.280 --> 03:04:41.560]  That's, that's, that's really him.
[03:04:41.560 --> 03:04:42.560]  He wouldn't give two fucks.
[03:04:42.600 --> 03:04:43.480]  He's not a troll.
[03:04:45.160 --> 03:04:48.120]  He's telling you exactly as a troll, but not just a troll.
[03:04:48.120 --> 03:04:48.400]  Yeah.
[03:04:48.480 --> 03:04:51.040]  I'm the one that lives under the bridge, not on the internet.
[03:04:52.480 --> 03:04:52.760]  Yeah.
[03:04:53.600 --> 03:04:54.880]  Is it, what does that sound for you?
[03:04:55.560 --> 03:04:56.560]  Is that, was that my ego?
[03:04:56.560 --> 03:04:57.000]  Define it.
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:57.200]  No, no, no.
[03:04:57.200 --> 03:04:57.400]  Yeah.
[03:04:57.400 --> 03:04:59.520]  There's, there's a secret behind what you said.
[03:04:59.680 --> 03:05:01.120]  Oh, there's a secret.
[03:05:01.200 --> 03:05:02.720]  Oh, is it a troll secret?
[03:05:03.600 --> 03:05:06.840]  Cause I mean, if I, if I had a troll secret, I would, I would probably come to you.
[03:05:07.560 --> 03:05:11.560]  You've been, you've been known to, uh, to piss quite a few people off.
[03:05:11.560 --> 03:05:12.040]  Oh no, no, no.
[03:05:12.040 --> 03:05:13.920]  That is one of the best ones ever.
[03:05:14.800 --> 03:05:16.360]  I can't now.
[03:05:16.400 --> 03:05:16.840]  I'm working.
[03:05:16.840 --> 03:05:17.360]  I'm working.
[03:05:17.360 --> 03:05:19.480]  I'm going to shoot myself in the foot on that, but I'll tell you later.
[03:05:19.520 --> 03:05:21.120]  I'm working on another podcast.
[03:05:21.840 --> 03:05:23.520]  And you alluded to the name.
[03:05:24.080 --> 03:05:24.600]  Accident.
[03:05:24.720 --> 03:05:26.080]  Don't, don't do it again, my friend.
[03:05:26.080 --> 03:05:27.600]  Cause we already done crossed over it.
[03:05:27.600 --> 03:05:28.640]  No, I'm good.
[03:05:28.920 --> 03:05:32.240]  But I'm just saying it's good.
[03:05:32.760 --> 03:05:33.280]  It's good.
[03:05:34.080 --> 03:05:34.560]  Good shit.
[03:05:34.800 --> 03:05:35.440]  Good shit.
[03:05:35.640 --> 03:05:38.240]  Oh, Jesse, Jesse pulled the mic out of the mic stand.
[03:05:38.240 --> 03:05:39.400]  You're going to get up and rush.
[03:05:44.040 --> 03:05:45.960]  You don't know that a rapper holds a microphone.
[03:05:46.400 --> 03:05:48.160]  That's Jesse right there.
[03:05:48.160 --> 03:05:48.800]  You don't know.
[03:05:51.280 --> 03:05:51.960]  Now fuck that.
[03:05:51.960 --> 03:05:52.720]  That's stupid.
[03:05:54.880 --> 03:05:56.240]  That's definitely how we do it.
[03:05:57.240 --> 03:05:59.600]  I'm ever seeing, um, Zach Taylor.
[03:05:59.600 --> 03:06:00.200]  Roche should do that.
[03:06:00.240 --> 03:06:01.800]  You're not a trap artist either though.
[03:06:02.040 --> 03:06:06.880]  You know, I could, uh, I could, I could introduce you to one of those if you need.
[03:06:07.280 --> 03:06:07.880]  I'm good.
[03:06:08.800 --> 03:06:12.120]  Just saying if you need fresh, hot beats, I could, I could,
[03:06:14.560 --> 03:06:16.000]  it sounds dirtier than it should be.
[03:06:16.040 --> 03:06:18.320]  It's really, I got these fresh, hot beats.
[03:06:18.600 --> 03:06:19.000]  Yeah.
[03:06:19.160 --> 03:06:19.400]  Yeah.
[03:06:19.680 --> 03:06:23.160]  There's the demon hot, uh, save a tree, kill a trap artist.
[03:06:24.400 --> 03:06:27.160]  I'm not sure why trap artists and trees.
[03:06:27.160 --> 03:06:29.280]  Where does that, just kill a trap artist.
[03:06:32.160 --> 03:06:33.800]  Save a puppy, kill a trap artist.
[03:06:33.840 --> 03:06:34.240]  Whoa.
[03:06:34.240 --> 03:06:34.840]  Wow.
[03:06:34.960 --> 03:06:36.160]  Tell us how you feel.
[03:06:36.280 --> 03:06:36.760]  Damn.
[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:37.200]  Yeah.
[03:06:37.240 --> 03:06:38.600]  Jesse doesn't like trap music.
[03:06:38.640 --> 03:06:38.880]  No.
[03:06:39.240 --> 03:06:40.200]  Did your headphones cut out?
[03:06:40.200 --> 03:06:41.680]  Cause you're, you're, oh yeah.
[03:06:41.680 --> 03:06:46.200]  Then I do a shout out to this piece of equipment.
[03:06:46.200 --> 03:06:51.240]  Every occasion, the live wire solutions, HAO for, uh, four channel
[03:06:51.240 --> 03:06:52.800]  stereo headphone amplifier.
[03:06:53.840 --> 03:06:54.920]  That thing sucks.
[03:06:54.920 --> 03:06:55.440]  Fuck you.
[03:06:55.520 --> 03:06:56.680]  Don't ever buy one of those.
[03:06:56.800 --> 03:07:01.520]  It is cutting out sometimes, but if you like pull on the wire, I put my phone on
[03:07:01.560 --> 03:07:02.400]  that's the connection.
[03:07:02.480 --> 03:07:02.920]  It's yeah.
[03:07:02.920 --> 03:07:03.880]  It's a connection, right?
[03:07:03.880 --> 03:07:04.160]  Right.
[03:07:04.160 --> 03:07:04.440]  Right.
[03:07:04.560 --> 03:07:04.800]  Ding.
[03:07:04.800 --> 03:07:05.400]  And I will hear.
[03:07:05.640 --> 03:07:05.920]  Yeah.
[03:07:05.920 --> 03:07:06.600]  That thing sucks.
[03:07:06.640 --> 03:07:09.360]  It's one of the things that me and Jesse literally sat down at the table and we've
[03:07:09.360 --> 03:07:11.120]  both kind of looked at it and said, huh?
[03:07:11.120 --> 03:07:12.760]  You're still using that piece of shit.
[03:07:13.320 --> 03:07:17.840]  This is because I mean, because if I go to guitar center and I tell him this sucks,
[03:07:17.840 --> 03:07:19.080]  they go, Oh, we know here's another one.
[03:07:19.080 --> 03:07:19.600]  Try this.
[03:07:20.960 --> 03:07:22.840]  The upgraded model is the same thing.
[03:07:22.840 --> 03:07:25.920]  Just with like a fancy plastic housing fixing solution.
[03:07:25.920 --> 03:07:27.200]  We get bigger problems.
[03:07:28.280 --> 03:07:28.680]  Ooh.
[03:07:28.720 --> 03:07:29.200]  Yeah.
[03:07:29.200 --> 03:07:34.880]  We use a, um, like it's a four way splitter, but it's all molded together.
[03:07:34.960 --> 03:07:36.200]  No independent channels.
[03:07:36.240 --> 03:07:36.760]  Oh yeah.
[03:07:36.840 --> 03:07:37.840]  I like the independent channels.
[03:07:37.840 --> 03:07:39.520]  Cause I like to crank mine up when I do my show.
[03:07:39.920 --> 03:07:40.480]  Like, yeah.
[03:07:40.760 --> 03:07:40.960]  Yeah.
[03:07:41.320 --> 03:07:42.080]  Put it up real loud.
[03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:42.480]  Yeah.
[03:07:43.040 --> 03:07:46.840]  And I mean, you got these phones making that shit go weird.
[03:07:47.840 --> 03:07:50.320]  Um, my phone's over here.
[03:07:50.600 --> 03:07:50.800]  Yeah.
[03:07:50.800 --> 03:07:51.360]  That's a phone.
[03:07:51.440 --> 03:07:53.840]  Someone's about to get a text message or something.
[03:07:54.520 --> 03:07:55.640]  Oh, we're all digging.
[03:07:55.720 --> 03:07:58.120]  I looked up across the room and everyone's got crack screens.
[03:07:58.160 --> 03:07:58.400]  No.
[03:07:59.000 --> 03:07:59.520]  Not mine.
[03:08:00.200 --> 03:08:04.200]  I had to get my, so I did crack a screen like a month ago.
[03:08:04.880 --> 03:08:07.880]  And that was like a hundred and dude, really?
[03:08:07.880 --> 03:08:09.680]  You got that sticker on there, man.
[03:08:09.760 --> 03:08:10.880]  This phone goes away.
[03:08:11.680 --> 03:08:13.280]  That sticker is so fucking cool.
[03:08:13.760 --> 03:08:16.400]  You know, you know what, you know what this sticker does prevent
[03:08:16.400 --> 03:08:17.680]  people from stealing my phone.
[03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:25.560]  A couple of days ago, my phone started and I had to go to the Apple store and
[03:08:25.560 --> 03:08:28.800]  they charged me 200 bucks to replace my phone and they wanted a whole bunch
[03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:31.080]  more money, but I was like, I just got the phone and the screen replaced.
[03:08:31.080 --> 03:08:32.480]  So can I get some, some love?
[03:08:32.480 --> 03:08:33.120]  And they hooked me up.
[03:08:33.120 --> 03:08:34.120]  They charged me 200 bucks.
[03:08:34.120 --> 03:08:34.640]  That sucked.
[03:08:34.800 --> 03:08:37.440]  Hey, that's if that's the love you should say.
[03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:39.200]  Yeah.
[03:08:39.640 --> 03:08:40.280]  That's Apple.
[03:08:40.720 --> 03:08:40.880]  Yeah.
[03:08:40.880 --> 03:08:41.320]  It's Apple.
[03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:41.680]  Dude.
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:44.240]  Just fucking close today.
[03:08:44.240 --> 03:08:44.640]  The fuck.
[03:08:46.120 --> 03:08:46.600]  Oh yeah.
[03:08:46.600 --> 03:08:49.240]  I try not to have my phone out when I'm near reservoirs.
[03:08:49.280 --> 03:08:49.640]  Yes.
[03:08:50.520 --> 03:08:51.160]  On the table.
[03:08:51.200 --> 03:08:53.000]  I've got three, 300 res.
[03:08:53.040 --> 03:08:53.400]  Yeah.
[03:08:53.640 --> 03:08:56.520]  Three, 300 gallon res is in a room lined up and then I've got
[03:08:56.520 --> 03:08:58.720]  two 55 gallon trash cans on wheels.
[03:08:59.240 --> 03:09:00.640]  Uh, they're usually filled with water.
[03:09:00.640 --> 03:09:02.320]  Then I've got another resin, another room.
[03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:03.920]  Try not to have that fucking phone.
[03:09:03.920 --> 03:09:05.080]  I got a mop bucket.
[03:09:05.080 --> 03:09:05.840]  What about UD?
[03:09:06.480 --> 03:09:09.960]  Is that all you got to work to worry about losing your phone in or probably some,
[03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:10.640]  some soup?
[03:09:10.640 --> 03:09:12.400]  No, I got a hot wheels at work.
[03:09:12.840 --> 03:09:13.280]  Oh, okay.
[03:09:13.360 --> 03:09:13.640]  All right.
[03:09:13.840 --> 03:09:16.720]  And then where we put the food in, I get a mop bucket.
[03:09:16.760 --> 03:09:18.120]  That's about my, or the toilet.
[03:09:18.160 --> 03:09:19.440]  You ever deep fry a phone on X?
[03:09:20.280 --> 03:09:21.480]  I've been worried about that.
[03:09:21.480 --> 03:09:22.840]  I want to hear it.
[03:09:24.480 --> 03:09:25.320]  Oh, let's Google it.
[03:09:26.240 --> 03:09:28.040]  I'm sure there's a YouTube video somewhere.
[03:09:28.040 --> 03:09:32.080]  I guarantee you that would suck cleaning that fucking fry around after that.
[03:09:32.080 --> 03:09:32.760]  I remember
[03:09:32.760 --> 03:09:36.600]  if it didn't, you didn't know, like, Oh no, I'm sure whoever we find, it's got
[03:09:36.600 --> 03:09:39.360]  like some clear fryer that we can see through and they're like, here it goes.
[03:09:39.360 --> 03:09:40.360]  And there's a camera in there.
[03:09:40.360 --> 03:09:40.920]  Boom.
[03:09:40.920 --> 03:09:42.240]  Cell phone ruptures in there.
[03:09:42.760 --> 03:09:43.880]  Wait, is this predator?
[03:09:43.880 --> 03:09:46.280]  I'm pretty sure we can dip it in the water.
[03:09:46.280 --> 03:09:46.880]  Let's do that.
[03:09:46.880 --> 03:09:47.760]  Buffalo iPhone.
[03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:48.280]  Buffalo.
[03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:50.840]  That'd be a nice revenge kind of thing.
[03:09:51.320 --> 03:09:53.240]  Breaded and fucking cooked your iPhone.
[03:09:53.240 --> 03:09:54.760]  You ever get sponsored by iPhone?
[03:09:54.760 --> 03:09:55.480]  That's what we're doing.
[03:09:55.480 --> 03:10:01.040]  Bro, if iPhone, if you want to sponsor my podcast, Apple, Apple, Apple, let's talk.
[03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:01.560]  Let's talk.
[03:10:01.560 --> 03:10:06.840]  Uh, that's Colorado podcast, 420 at gmail.com.
[03:10:06.840 --> 03:10:09.680]  So you don't need that when you're in the kitchen.
[03:10:09.680 --> 03:10:10.640]  You don't need that.
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:11.440]  You don't need that.
[03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:12.240]  You don't need that.
[03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:13.000]  You don't need that.
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:13.720]  You don't need that.
[03:10:13.720 --> 03:10:14.400]  You don't need that.
[03:10:14.400 --> 03:10:15.080]  You don't need that.
[03:10:15.320 --> 03:10:18.040]  You don't need that when you get enough sponsors, let us have just one.
[03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:18.440]  Apple.
[03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:18.840]  Apple's.
[03:10:18.840 --> 03:10:20.000]  I got a Mac book over here.
[03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:21.480]  We got, he's got an Apple PC.
[03:10:21.480 --> 03:10:23.120]  I got three iPhones in here.
[03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:25.160]  That's about equal to his PC.
[03:10:25.160 --> 03:10:25.960]  Maybe they want to sponsor both of us.
[03:10:25.960 --> 03:10:26.160]  Yeah.
[03:10:26.160 --> 03:10:27.040]  Let's just get a thing.
[03:10:27.040 --> 03:10:27.680]  Co-Apple.
[03:10:27.680 --> 03:10:28.240]  Just send us.
[03:10:28.240 --> 03:10:31.640]  We need, we need a Mac book for D to do recording.
[03:10:31.800 --> 03:10:32.040]  Yep.
[03:10:32.040 --> 03:10:35.480]  We need another Mac book for me because this one's filled with photography and other nonsense.
[03:10:35.480 --> 03:10:38.080]  I need one to dedicate to the show and one that I could Google with.
[03:10:38.080 --> 03:10:38.440]  Yep.
[03:10:38.440 --> 03:10:40.040]  I'm going to need to research one.
[03:10:40.040 --> 03:10:41.360]  Jesse needs one.
[03:10:41.920 --> 03:10:43.240]  Adam, can you use one in your car?
[03:10:43.240 --> 03:10:43.680]  No, no, no.
[03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:44.960]  I'm a PC kind of guy, dude.
[03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:45.560]  All right.
[03:10:45.680 --> 03:10:47.360]  I think that might take up much of his house.
[03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:49.040]  No, I need the new iPad.
[03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:50.880]  That might put me above my tax bracket.
[03:10:50.920 --> 03:10:53.440]  I need one of those new iPads, that iPad pro thing.
[03:10:53.440 --> 03:10:54.960]  I think you could go ahead and send me one of those.
[03:10:54.960 --> 03:10:56.120]  I think it's pretty fucking dope.
[03:10:56.160 --> 03:10:57.160]  I would use that a lot.
[03:10:57.160 --> 03:10:59.600]  I mean, you would definitely get shout outs all the time.
[03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:00.840]  Snapchat, Snapchat grams.
[03:11:00.840 --> 03:11:03.040]  Videos from the garden would be phenomenal with that new iPad.
[03:11:03.040 --> 03:11:05.320]  You know, I could do metric from the, from the garden.
[03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:06.680]  I wouldn't have to go use the main computer.
[03:11:06.680 --> 03:11:07.080]  I could do it.
[03:11:07.080 --> 03:11:07.400]  Really?
[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:07.720]  Yeah.
[03:11:07.720 --> 03:11:08.120]  Wow.
[03:11:08.240 --> 03:11:09.360]  You can do metric from an iPad.
[03:11:09.480 --> 03:11:09.760]  Hell yeah.
[03:11:09.760 --> 03:11:10.280]  That'd be cool.
[03:11:10.920 --> 03:11:11.440]  That'd help out.
[03:11:11.600 --> 03:11:11.880]  Yeah.
[03:11:11.920 --> 03:11:12.160]  Yeah.
[03:11:12.320 --> 03:11:13.960]  You just walk around and do your plants right there.
[03:11:15.160 --> 03:11:15.840]  You just carry it with you.
[03:11:15.840 --> 03:11:19.440]  It'd be so much easier trying to have the MacBook or something in the fucking
[03:11:19.440 --> 03:11:19.920]  grow with you.
[03:11:20.520 --> 03:11:20.760]  Yeah.
[03:11:21.520 --> 03:11:22.920]  Sounds like you need to invest in that.
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:23.240]  Yeah.
[03:11:23.240 --> 03:11:24.080]  So come on guys.
[03:11:24.080 --> 03:11:24.560]  Go ahead and eat.
[03:11:25.400 --> 03:11:25.880]  Come on Apple.
[03:11:26.800 --> 03:11:28.240]  We're going to be starting him a Kickstarter.
[03:11:31.560 --> 03:11:32.040]  That'd be cool.
[03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:32.920]  What are you trying to buy?
[03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:34.600]  Like an $800 iPad.
[03:11:36.720 --> 03:11:37.480]  Just Kickstarter.
[03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:39.640]  I probably know 800 people.
[03:11:40.600 --> 03:11:41.080]  For sure.
[03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:41.400]  Get it.
[03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:42.120]  For sure.
[03:11:42.440 --> 03:11:45.840]  I bet you could put a jar on the table and be like you this way.
[03:11:45.840 --> 03:11:46.680]  You could watch me at work.
[03:11:47.520 --> 03:11:48.760]  You say we don't hang out enough.
[03:11:48.760 --> 03:11:49.400]  Here you go.
[03:11:49.920 --> 03:11:51.200]  I'll Periscope all day long.
[03:11:51.360 --> 03:11:51.720]  Right.
[03:11:53.240 --> 03:11:53.920]  Oh my God.
[03:11:53.960 --> 03:11:54.400]  What'd you do?
[03:11:54.400 --> 03:11:55.120]  That was my phone.
[03:11:55.720 --> 03:11:57.200]  There's thousands of dollars.
[03:11:57.720 --> 03:11:59.800]  I'm not going through this every time I drop something.
[03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:00.240]  I'm buying.
[03:12:00.240 --> 03:12:00.600]  Damn it.
[03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:02.920]  That's why it has a crack screen.
[03:12:03.120 --> 03:12:03.360]  Yep.
[03:12:04.440 --> 03:12:05.080]  And that sticker.
[03:12:07.800 --> 03:12:08.320]  Shit.
[03:12:08.520 --> 03:12:09.920]  Have they even harvested yet?
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:11.240]  Nope.
[03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:11.960]  No.
[03:12:12.600 --> 03:12:13.240]  Why would they?
[03:12:13.320 --> 03:12:14.280]  I'm not going to talk about that.
[03:12:16.320 --> 03:12:17.440]  Hey, hey though.
[03:12:17.600 --> 03:12:19.160]  I gave him shit when I first got here.
[03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:21.520]  I was like, so what's up with someone?
[03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:24.160]  So he's like, oh yeah, yeah, no.
[03:12:25.040 --> 03:12:26.640]  So that's such a big conversation.
[03:12:26.640 --> 03:12:27.480]  It was very big.
[03:12:27.680 --> 03:12:29.000]  It was very big for the listeners.
[03:12:29.160 --> 03:12:29.920]  Not big for him.
[03:12:29.920 --> 03:12:31.000]  Cause we had this conversation.
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.440]  I was like, oh yeah, yeah.
[03:12:33.680 --> 03:12:39.120]  Jesse looks just as vague as the chick that worked at the shop.
[03:12:39.520 --> 03:12:40.200]  Hey, stop.
[03:12:42.160 --> 03:12:42.680]  Stop.
[03:12:42.720 --> 03:12:45.240]  He got on a couple episodes back.
[03:12:45.240 --> 03:12:46.920]  There was totally a moment.
[03:12:46.920 --> 03:12:50.080]  I just wanted to be like, shut the fuck up already, dude.
[03:12:51.920 --> 03:12:54.920]  Well, a big look doesn't mean shut the fuck up.
[03:12:54.920 --> 03:12:56.680]  Maybe it was like two shows ago.
[03:12:56.720 --> 03:12:59.720]  This is, you look at me and you go, you've already said far too much.
[03:12:59.760 --> 03:13:02.440]  Well, I'm trying to point over my shoulder to show Derek where to piss.
[03:13:02.440 --> 03:13:03.400]  And I'm like, it's over here.
[03:13:03.400 --> 03:13:05.040]  And I just see it's right behind me.
[03:13:05.480 --> 03:13:07.880]  It's right on Jeff, right on the back of his chair.
[03:13:07.880 --> 03:13:09.000]  I'm like, I'm just going to go.
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:09.520]  I'm going to go.
[03:13:09.520 --> 03:13:10.000]  I'm going to go.
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:10.520]  I'm going to go.
[03:13:10.520 --> 03:13:11.040]  I'm going to go.
[03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:12.120]  Right on the back of his chair.
[03:13:12.800 --> 03:13:13.320]  That'd be great.
[03:13:14.640 --> 03:13:15.600]  You said right behind you.
[03:13:15.920 --> 03:13:17.240]  Just keep talking right here.
[03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:18.800]  So crevasse, right?
[03:13:18.800 --> 03:13:19.840]  Don't mind me guys.
[03:13:20.520 --> 03:13:21.360]  Stop looking.
[03:13:22.800 --> 03:13:24.080]  I can hear it on the microphone.
[03:13:25.200 --> 03:13:26.880]  If we're quiet enough, watch it for quiet.
[03:13:27.080 --> 03:13:27.480]  Oh yeah.
[03:13:27.520 --> 03:13:28.040]  You think so?
[03:13:28.640 --> 03:13:28.960]  I'll be.
[03:13:29.520 --> 03:13:29.720]  I'll be.
[03:13:30.240 --> 03:13:31.600]  Let me set my mic up just right for it.
[03:13:31.680 --> 03:13:31.880]  All right.
[03:13:31.880 --> 03:13:33.280]  I can sit in the side so we can hear him.
[03:13:33.440 --> 03:13:33.800]  Okay.
[03:13:41.760 --> 03:13:42.720]  Pee louder.
[03:13:44.840 --> 03:13:45.560]  In the bowl.
[03:13:49.080 --> 03:13:50.080]  No, not going to be able to hear it.
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:52.240]  Oh man.
[03:13:52.320 --> 03:13:52.760]  I tried.
[03:13:53.520 --> 03:13:54.320]  That was funny though.
[03:13:54.480 --> 03:13:55.440]  It was a valiant effort.
[03:13:55.440 --> 03:13:56.760]  I give you credit.
[03:13:57.120 --> 03:13:59.560]  That's probably the weirdest thing I've ever done on your show.
[03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:02.480]  And it wasn't even from me.
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:03.560]  I'm so happy.
[03:14:03.560 --> 03:14:05.080]  This is the show of many firsts.
[03:14:05.160 --> 03:14:06.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:14:06.320 --> 03:14:07.920]  This is, this is excellent though.
[03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:09.000]  I've had a good time.
[03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:09.600]  And I'm high as fuck.
[03:14:09.600 --> 03:14:10.720]  Jesse's intro is the best.
[03:14:10.720 --> 03:14:14.200]  I was just kind of, it's testing the waters and I was like, well, that's going.
[03:14:14.920 --> 03:14:17.440]  There's no way I'm fucking editing that out of a podcast.
[03:14:17.440 --> 03:14:20.160]  Did you hear us come back from breaking a couple of weeks ago when he thought he was
[03:14:20.160 --> 03:14:21.720]  like answering the phone and he was like, hello,
[03:14:26.080 --> 03:14:27.800]  D's like, yo, what's going on?
[03:14:27.800 --> 03:14:28.600]  And he goes, hello.
[03:14:29.080 --> 03:14:32.160]  So for the people that are listening on my feed, where can the people listen to
[03:14:32.160 --> 03:14:33.000]  your guys' show?
[03:14:34.680 --> 03:14:37.920]  We're on SoundCloud, Colorado podcast at the moment.
[03:14:38.120 --> 03:14:41.920]  Um, and then you can also find them on our website and find them, find them on

[03:14:47.200 --> 03:14:47.840]  Jeez.
[03:14:47.840 --> 03:14:48.640]  Come on, D.
[03:14:48.880 --> 03:14:50.200]  You gotta learn your own website.
[03:14:50.200 --> 03:14:50.720]  Yeah.
[03:14:50.800 --> 03:14:51.760]  I'm a little high guys.
[03:14:51.800 --> 03:14:53.480]  And P louder next time, bro.
[03:14:53.480 --> 03:14:54.280]  Like what the fuck?
[03:14:54.280 --> 03:14:55.000]  We're turning the mic up.
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:56.200]  Yeah, we were trying it.
[03:14:56.400 --> 03:14:56.960]  It was weird.
[03:14:56.960 --> 03:14:58.120]  Can our guys find yours?
[03:14:58.680 --> 03:15:00.880]  Uh, they can find my show is available on iTunes.
[03:15:00.920 --> 03:15:02.160]  We're going to get your show on iTunes.
[03:15:02.240 --> 03:15:03.160]  I'm going to help you do that.
[03:15:03.400 --> 03:15:05.000]  We've even got an RSS feed now.
[03:15:05.440 --> 03:15:10.160]  The IT guys, the IT guys just, what are you doing?
[03:15:10.200 --> 03:15:11.400]  Put that shit up on iTunes, bro.
[03:15:11.440 --> 03:15:13.400]  You know, we've kind of been waiting for this talk too.
[03:15:14.400 --> 03:15:15.240]  I'm on iTunes.
[03:15:15.240 --> 03:15:15.800]  I'm on stitcher.
[03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:17.280]  My show is available on my website.
[03:15:17.320 --> 03:15:20.800]  I read genetics, Colorado.com and my show is available every Wednesday
[03:15:20.800 --> 03:15:22.080]  at one o'clock on Tok radio.
[03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:22.840]  That's pretty cool.
[03:15:22.920 --> 03:15:23.200]  Nice.
[03:15:23.200 --> 03:15:23.400]  Yeah.
[03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:24.120]  Shout out to Jason.
[03:15:24.520 --> 03:15:24.840]  Yeah.
[03:15:24.880 --> 03:15:25.160]  Yeah.
[03:15:25.240 --> 03:15:26.640]  I hadn't even ever heard about that.
[03:15:26.720 --> 03:15:28.480]  Uh, go to Tok radio.com.
[03:15:28.480 --> 03:15:28.960]  You can listen.
[03:15:28.960 --> 03:15:29.640]  It's a live feed.
[03:15:29.640 --> 03:15:30.560]  It's just always streaming.
[03:15:30.560 --> 03:15:31.160]  Something's going on.
[03:15:31.160 --> 03:15:33.760]  Sometimes Jay jumps in and does live stuff.
[03:15:33.760 --> 03:15:36.240]  He'll just play music based on his, uh, his vibe of the day.
[03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:39.400]  I know you're a busy guy now, but is there, are you still doing genetics?
[03:15:39.840 --> 03:15:40.360]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:15:40.360 --> 03:15:40.520]  Still.
[03:15:40.520 --> 03:15:40.720]  Okay.
[03:15:40.720 --> 03:15:43.280]  Well, I just, I didn't know if you wanted to plug that too, but for
[03:15:43.320 --> 03:15:47.040]  the listeners, I don't have anything available at the time, but I'm making a
[03:15:47.040 --> 03:15:51.640]  rise F twos, which, uh, I'll be, uh, all of my testers bust through a bunch of
[03:15:51.640 --> 03:15:53.480]  those and then I may put some of those out to the public.
[03:15:53.600 --> 03:15:55.000]  I definitely like arise a lot.
[03:15:55.920 --> 03:15:57.120]  We had a really good cut of that.
[03:15:57.120 --> 03:15:57.400]  Didn't we?
[03:15:57.600 --> 03:15:57.840]  Yeah.
[03:15:57.880 --> 03:16:00.880]  We had like a, it was like our number three or number five or something like that.
[03:16:00.880 --> 03:16:01.240]  No, I don't know.
[03:16:01.240 --> 03:16:03.880]  Rise number one is the one you're thinking.
[03:16:03.880 --> 03:16:04.360]  Okay.
[03:16:04.800 --> 03:16:05.160]  All right.
[03:16:05.480 --> 03:16:09.000]  I know it was an odd number five was really good too, but I bet you're talking
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:11.440]  about, I think it was number one that we kept around for a long time.
[03:16:11.520 --> 03:16:13.800]  So I mean, that was some of the early stuff you had.
[03:16:13.800 --> 03:16:18.000]  I've got an amazing boy of that, uh, that cross and then I've got girls of that.
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:22.480]  And then I'm going to put like several females in a room, probably like
[03:16:22.800 --> 03:16:25.080]  somewhere between 16 and 20 girls.
[03:16:25.120 --> 03:16:28.960]  And that arise male in a room, two of the arise, the same male, but two clones
[03:16:28.960 --> 03:16:31.760]  of it in the same room and grow them out and fucking hit that pollen on all those
[03:16:31.760 --> 03:16:35.680]  plants and make like between 15 and 20 new crosses and test them all out.
[03:16:35.840 --> 03:16:36.560]  So it works.
[03:16:37.080 --> 03:16:44.120]  Um, now that I think about that arise number one that we had, um, it's your
[03:16:44.120 --> 03:16:46.600]  male is the male counterpart to that phenotype.
[03:16:46.840 --> 03:16:47.280]  Nice.
[03:16:48.560 --> 03:16:50.840]  Just big, tall, amazing, but it's crazy.
[03:16:50.840 --> 03:16:55.160]  But yeah, giant, big, big, but yeah.
[03:16:55.760 --> 03:16:56.480]  Both of the parents.
[03:16:56.480 --> 03:16:56.720]  Oh yeah.
[03:16:56.720 --> 03:17:00.080]  That was one of the things we did out in, uh, last year, right?
[03:17:00.080 --> 03:17:00.280]  Yeah.
[03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:01.040]  In the greenhouse.
[03:17:01.120 --> 03:17:01.400]  Yeah.
[03:17:01.760 --> 03:17:03.440]  Oh, that was the first time we ran that.
[03:17:03.560 --> 03:17:06.200]  Um, actually that was two years ago.
[03:17:06.200 --> 03:17:07.600]  We also had the black cherry Kim.
[03:17:07.720 --> 03:17:08.520]  No, that was last year.
[03:17:08.600 --> 03:17:09.040]  Oh yeah.
[03:17:09.120 --> 03:17:12.880]  When I bred arise, I really expected it to take longer to finish flowering, but I
[03:17:12.880 --> 03:17:16.680]  get a seven and a half to eight to nine week phenotypes out of that stuff.
[03:17:16.720 --> 03:17:20.160]  It's like, um, uh, golden goat a lot there.
[03:17:20.280 --> 03:17:20.560]  Yeah.
[03:17:20.640 --> 03:17:22.720]  There are a lot of golden goat dominant phenotypes.
[03:17:22.720 --> 03:17:22.880]  Yeah.
[03:17:22.880 --> 03:17:26.280]  I would think golden goat on appearances.
[03:17:27.200 --> 03:17:29.600]  I think a lot of growers, if they didn't know what it was, but they
[03:17:29.600 --> 03:17:31.920]  could, it was a longer flowering strain than it actually is.
[03:17:31.960 --> 03:17:35.360]  That trait actually comes from the Romulan in it because Romulan is from
[03:17:35.360 --> 03:17:38.600]  Canada and those guys bred their shit to finish a little earlier and they found
[03:17:38.600 --> 03:17:41.440]  the earlier finishing sativas and went for that aspect of it.
[03:17:41.440 --> 03:17:44.560]  It's like we were talking to Christian the other day on one of the
[03:17:44.560 --> 03:17:46.680]  forums or one of the groups.
[03:17:47.040 --> 03:17:47.720]  Uh, yeah.
[03:17:47.720 --> 03:17:51.280]  If you, if you guys want to learn something, please check out
[03:17:51.280 --> 03:17:52.480]  the grow from your heart podcast.
[03:17:52.480 --> 03:17:56.000]  I mean, we're, we're Jesse's knowledgeable and Derek is, you know, he's got the
[03:17:56.000 --> 03:18:00.200]  years underneath his belt and I'm, I'm learning as we go, but like Jeff, you've
[03:18:00.200 --> 03:18:03.680]  had, you've definitely had the experience for the indoor for years and years and
[03:18:03.680 --> 03:18:06.000]  years, so I get a lot of practice lately.
[03:18:06.040 --> 03:18:06.560]  Yeah.
[03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:08.280]  Go check out the grow from your heart podcast.
[03:18:08.280 --> 03:18:08.640]  For sure.
[03:18:08.640 --> 03:18:08.840]  Yeah.
[03:18:08.840 --> 03:18:11.760]  And the guys that are listening, honestly, the two best growers in
[03:18:11.760 --> 03:18:13.840]  town are sitting at the table right here.
[03:18:13.840 --> 03:18:15.600]  You're the indoor dude and you're the outdoor dude.
[03:18:15.600 --> 03:18:19.840]  I mean, that's the way it's been on your podcast and that's, you know, like, so
[03:18:19.840 --> 03:18:23.920]  if, if I was going to ask a question for somebody, you're the person I would call
[03:18:23.920 --> 03:18:25.720]  for indoor and you're the person I would call for outdoor.
[03:18:25.720 --> 03:18:26.880]  So I mean, yeah, thank you.
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:27.360]  No, no, no.
[03:18:27.360 --> 03:18:27.760]  That's cool.
[03:18:27.760 --> 03:18:29.600]  I'm happy to be a part of all of it.
[03:18:29.600 --> 03:18:29.920]  You know?
[03:18:30.120 --> 03:18:33.720]  I don't think I'm really worthy of that, but I mean, well, I don't know too many
[03:18:33.720 --> 03:18:35.320]  outdoor growers either, so don't, don't.
[03:18:36.440 --> 03:18:39.280]  Well, there, hey, everyone's an outdoor grower.
[03:18:39.440 --> 03:18:40.000]  Apparently.
[03:18:40.840 --> 03:18:41.840]  Oh, I meant that in a good way.
[03:18:42.480 --> 03:18:43.880]  Or everyone can be an outdoor grower.
[03:18:43.880 --> 03:18:44.200]  Yeah.
[03:18:44.320 --> 03:18:46.920]  Everybody, the sun will save your ass many a times.
[03:18:46.920 --> 03:18:47.440]  Want to Jeff?
[03:18:48.040 --> 03:18:48.280]  Yeah.
[03:18:48.320 --> 03:18:50.320]  I only meant that slightly sarcastically.
[03:18:51.120 --> 03:18:56.880]  Jeff watched my plants live and die and live and die and live and die.
[03:18:56.880 --> 03:19:00.960]  Like for the first year I was here and I was scrambling to ask you questions.
[03:19:00.960 --> 03:19:04.640]  And like, I was telling him to ask you questions on shows like, what do I do
[03:19:04.640 --> 03:19:05.280]  about ants?
[03:19:05.280 --> 03:19:07.240]  And I was like, I know I'll just cover it in dirt.
[03:19:07.320 --> 03:19:08.920]  Like, dude, that was the worst thing I ever did.
[03:19:08.920 --> 03:19:12.880]  I covered it in dirt at like 11 in the afternoon and by two, they were like
[03:19:12.880 --> 03:19:14.280]  literally floppy plants.
[03:19:14.280 --> 03:19:16.600]  And I was like, you covered it with sand.
[03:19:16.640 --> 03:19:16.920]  Yeah.
[03:19:16.920 --> 03:19:17.560]  Like raw.
[03:19:17.560 --> 03:19:19.000]  Like that's, I remember that now.
[03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:20.600]  And there was no way for the water to get through.
[03:19:20.600 --> 03:19:26.120]  I watched some asshole cover it in like fine particulate sand that he bought from
[03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:26.720]  a store.
[03:19:27.280 --> 03:19:32.080]  And it was, I've seen people do that to, uh, get rid of Nats.
[03:19:32.680 --> 03:19:33.240]  Yes.
[03:19:33.320 --> 03:19:34.440]  I've tried it before.
[03:19:34.600 --> 03:19:39.240]  It's a pain in the fucking ass, but outdoors and a root bound container that
[03:19:39.240 --> 03:19:41.520]  is so root bound is drying out every day.
[03:19:42.080 --> 03:19:43.600]  And they were in a five gallon bucket.
[03:19:43.680 --> 03:19:47.160]  I mean, no, they were in earth pots, but they were definitely drying out every
[03:19:47.160 --> 03:19:47.280]  day.
[03:19:47.280 --> 03:19:48.760]  Drying out every day.
[03:19:48.760 --> 03:19:52.360]  You'd wake up and be like, I'd wake up at 10 o'clock and be like, Holy shit.
[03:19:52.360 --> 03:19:52.880]  What's wrong?
[03:19:52.920 --> 03:19:53.480]  Did you hear that?
[03:19:53.520 --> 03:19:53.960]  Did you hear that?
[03:19:53.960 --> 03:19:55.560]  You guys, I would wake up at 10 o'clock.
[03:19:56.440 --> 03:19:58.920]  Hey, do you know what I've done by 10 o'clock in the morning?
[03:19:59.640 --> 03:20:00.440]  Yeah, I do.
[03:20:00.440 --> 03:20:08.720]  You guys remember when shakers and I worked a pipe shop, I hustled glass all
[03:20:08.720 --> 03:20:09.000]  day.
[03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:10.040]  Like, I'm sorry, man.
[03:20:10.040 --> 03:20:11.680]  Like there's different, there's different spectrums.
[03:20:11.680 --> 03:20:14.200]  He like, he just told me today, he's like, man, you really need to try for your
[03:20:14.200 --> 03:20:14.520]  badge.
[03:20:14.520 --> 03:20:20.560]  And I was like, I'd love to, but I mean, 44 already fucking, I haven't had a felony
[03:20:20.560 --> 03:20:21.360]  in 10 years.
[03:20:21.360 --> 03:20:25.600]  So I think you might be able to get a bad, I mean, and none of my charges.
[03:20:26.320 --> 03:20:30.040]  Until way, way back when I was judicated as an adult, I have anything to do with
[03:20:30.040 --> 03:20:31.760]  any kind of like drugs.
[03:20:31.760 --> 03:20:32.640]  So yeah.
[03:20:32.640 --> 03:20:35.160]  So I mean, yeah, so I'm good.
[03:20:35.160 --> 03:20:35.760]  You're dipshittery.
[03:20:35.800 --> 03:20:36.560]  Just pure.
[03:20:36.560 --> 03:20:38.600]  I'm a fucking dumb kid, dude.
[03:20:39.120 --> 03:20:40.920]  I was a dumb kid when I was 19.
[03:20:40.920 --> 03:20:41.680]  No shit.
[03:20:41.720 --> 03:20:43.560]  You know, like, give me a fucking break.
[03:20:43.640 --> 03:20:44.680]  So dipshittery.
[03:20:44.960 --> 03:20:47.520]  Um, I think your 19 year old self still shines through.
[03:20:47.560 --> 03:20:50.600]  No, no, I play a good fool.
[03:20:51.280 --> 03:20:52.000]  That's what it is.
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:54.040]  You know, 44 is actually 20.
[03:20:54.080 --> 03:20:59.800]  No, I wish that was true, but yeah, I wouldn't be sitting here.
[03:20:59.920 --> 03:21:00.840]  No, I sure wouldn't.
[03:21:02.120 --> 03:21:02.800]  I sure wouldn't.
[03:21:02.800 --> 03:21:03.160]  Now.
[03:21:03.240 --> 03:21:03.880]  No, no.
[03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:05.680]  I learned my lesson on them 20 year old.
[03:21:07.360 --> 03:21:08.720]  Unfortunately I haven't.
[03:21:08.720 --> 03:21:10.600]  So you ain't even got a pretty mouth.
[03:21:12.280 --> 03:21:12.560]  Fuck.
[03:21:12.560 --> 03:21:13.320]  No, I don't.
[03:21:14.800 --> 03:21:16.440]  I thought we had that conversation early.
[03:21:17.040 --> 03:21:17.360]  Fuck.
[03:21:18.440 --> 03:21:19.960]  No, this got really weird.
[03:21:19.960 --> 03:21:22.480]  I think in my next episode, I'm going to talk about how to take care of fungus
[03:21:22.520 --> 03:21:25.240]  gnats and like soil borne pests and stuff like that.
[03:21:25.800 --> 03:21:28.600]  One of my listeners sent an email, so I'm glad that you said fungus nets.
[03:21:29.040 --> 03:21:30.360]  Don't use fucking sand.
[03:21:30.840 --> 03:21:31.280]  Yeah.
[03:21:31.280 --> 03:21:31.640]  Yeah.
[03:21:31.640 --> 03:21:36.160]  Just, yeah, it worked, but I think it caused more suffocates everything.
[03:21:36.200 --> 03:21:37.600]  And then, yeah, yeah.
[03:21:37.760 --> 03:21:39.280]  This was on an organic grow.
[03:21:39.360 --> 03:21:40.400]  I like growing in cocoa.
[03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:42.320]  I've been growing in cocoa lately.
[03:21:42.600 --> 03:21:43.400]  Oh yeah.
[03:21:43.440 --> 03:21:44.360]  Cocoa is rad.
[03:21:44.360 --> 03:21:45.160]  Cocoa is nice.
[03:21:45.240 --> 03:21:46.080]  A hundred percent cocoa.
[03:21:46.120 --> 03:21:46.720]  That's there.
[03:21:46.760 --> 03:21:49.240]  There are things mixed into my cocoa because that's what we've, we've
[03:21:49.240 --> 03:21:51.800]  purchased it and we still have the shit and I mix it in just because it works.
[03:21:52.160 --> 03:21:53.240]  But eventually it's straight up.
[03:21:53.760 --> 03:21:57.240]  We've mixed quite a bit of cocoa in things too, I believe along the way.
[03:21:57.720 --> 03:22:00.680]  Like where we did the first run in cocoa and then we were like, yeah, fuck that.
[03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:05.000]  So yeah, we've, uh, we've had cocoa to mix, I believe.
[03:22:06.560 --> 03:22:08.760]  I'm doing a home in cocoa right now.
[03:22:09.640 --> 03:22:10.200]  Pure cocoa.
[03:22:10.360 --> 03:22:10.560]  Yeah.
[03:22:11.160 --> 03:22:11.560]  I like it.
[03:22:11.640 --> 03:22:12.360]  Well, two per.
[03:22:13.120 --> 03:22:13.360]  Okay.
[03:22:13.360 --> 03:22:15.560]  So, I mean, it's got a little broadcasting.
[03:22:17.320 --> 03:22:17.520]  Yep.
[03:22:17.800 --> 03:22:18.800]  That's exactly what's in mind.
[03:22:18.840 --> 03:22:19.080]  Yeah.
[03:22:19.720 --> 03:22:20.640]  I just wasn't going to say.
[03:22:21.840 --> 03:22:22.800]  We were talking about it.
[03:22:24.800 --> 03:22:27.400]  Um, and we both came to the same conclusion too.
[03:22:27.560 --> 03:22:27.760]  Yeah.
[03:22:27.760 --> 03:22:30.520]  Well, uh, fucking head cultivator.
[03:22:30.520 --> 03:22:31.480]  You know what I mean, D?
[03:22:32.080 --> 03:22:33.440]  Mills, Paceys.
[03:22:33.640 --> 03:22:35.720]  I've done tables in just all.
[03:22:35.720 --> 03:22:35.920]  Okay.
[03:22:36.240 --> 03:22:42.000]  I've just, um, space mills and, um, OG Bioware.
[03:22:42.320 --> 03:22:44.080]  So this dude is key badges.
[03:22:45.440 --> 03:22:46.240]  First one in last one.
[03:22:46.240 --> 03:22:48.280]  No, I always give him shit when he comes into the shop.
[03:22:48.800 --> 03:22:50.000]  The, what was the last one he said?
[03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:50.640]  OG Bioware?
[03:22:50.640 --> 03:22:51.400]  OG Bioware.
[03:22:51.400 --> 03:22:51.720]  Okay.
[03:22:52.040 --> 03:22:56.320]  So I'm just going to do that as a, like a base test.
[03:22:56.440 --> 03:22:57.840]  The OG Bioware crushes.
[03:22:57.920 --> 03:22:58.280]  Oh yeah.
[03:22:58.360 --> 03:22:59.720]  Oh, I've been using it for years.
[03:23:00.200 --> 03:23:02.800]  I've been using it since it was called caps beneficial.
[03:23:03.280 --> 03:23:03.760]  Yeah.
[03:23:03.800 --> 03:23:04.200]  Wow.
[03:23:04.200 --> 03:23:04.680]  Okay.
[03:23:04.760 --> 03:23:05.000]  Yeah.
[03:23:05.120 --> 03:23:05.560]  Yeah.
[03:23:05.640 --> 03:23:05.920]  Yeah.
[03:23:06.040 --> 03:23:10.640]  Uh, when you could order it from the dude on the fucking roll it up.
[03:23:10.880 --> 03:23:11.560]  No, where was it?
[03:23:11.560 --> 03:23:15.480]  Was that he goes back that far?
[03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:15.800]  Yeah.
[03:23:15.840 --> 03:23:18.520]  But, uh, it was on TFC farmer.
[03:23:20.240 --> 03:23:21.520]  Way back in the day, bro.
[03:23:21.640 --> 03:23:22.000]  Yeah.
[03:23:22.040 --> 03:23:24.000]  Remember when he had to do shit on IRC?
[03:23:24.600 --> 03:23:26.080]  No, I don't remember IRC sadly.
[03:23:26.200 --> 03:23:30.280]  I remember IRC through anarchy online, but that was my experience with IRC
[03:23:30.280 --> 03:23:32.960]  because I mean, I played in arcane line for 12 years, dude.
[03:23:32.960 --> 03:23:36.600]  Like it was, it was years of my wife's life that I wasted.
[03:23:36.680 --> 03:23:37.640]  Did you say my wife?
[03:23:37.680 --> 03:23:38.280]  My wife.
[03:23:38.800 --> 03:23:39.640]  My wife.
[03:23:42.400 --> 03:23:46.120]  That was so bad with him because he goes to Benson and Benson's so bond point
[03:23:46.120 --> 03:23:46.360]  with that.
[03:23:46.360 --> 03:23:47.120]  I'm like, here, hold up.
[03:23:47.320 --> 03:23:48.560]  Get a picture with me and my wife.
[03:23:48.560 --> 03:23:49.760]  And he's like, Oh yeah, yeah.
[03:23:49.760 --> 03:23:51.080]  I'm going to, I'm giving it to you.
[03:23:52.040 --> 03:23:57.160]  So then my plan is, is, um, I'm going to do another run after it with the exact
[03:23:57.160 --> 03:24:02.200]  same thing, but I'm going to add teas to it once a week and just see, you know,
[03:24:02.320 --> 03:24:03.520]  compare final product.
[03:24:04.720 --> 03:24:07.840]  We're doing a side by side comparison with two different nutrient brands right
[03:24:07.840 --> 03:24:08.120]  now.
[03:24:08.440 --> 03:24:10.480]  Um, Oh no, your shit's cut now.
[03:24:10.480 --> 03:24:12.920]  Cause I touched it and I touched it again and fucking killed it again.
[03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:13.640]  Wiggle it again.
[03:24:13.680 --> 03:24:14.160]  Is it working?
[03:24:14.560 --> 03:24:14.960]  Can you hear me?
[03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:15.680]  Can you hear me now?
[03:24:15.720 --> 03:24:16.400]  Can you hear me now?
[03:24:16.440 --> 03:24:16.840]  How about now?
[03:24:19.160 --> 03:24:19.840]  Quit touching it.
[03:24:20.200 --> 03:24:20.440]  All right.
[03:24:20.720 --> 03:24:23.560]  So we're running and we're going to retire one brand.
[03:24:23.560 --> 03:24:24.680]  So I think I can talk about it.
[03:24:24.720 --> 03:24:24.960]  I don't know.
[03:24:25.040 --> 03:24:27.320]  I'm not sure what I'm allowed to talk about really, because some of it's like
[03:24:27.320 --> 03:24:29.880]  confidential, but we're testing, I've talked about it on Facebook.
[03:24:29.880 --> 03:24:34.080]  We've got veg bloom in one tank and we're on week one, like three or what's
[03:24:34.080 --> 03:24:37.360]  the Thursdays were four days in the plants look fucking happy.
[03:24:37.680 --> 03:24:37.800]  Right.
[03:24:37.880 --> 03:24:41.000]  Like, but I mean, we're in cocoa, so I'm sure I would see something by now if
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:44.400]  they were not happy and they get fed, they're on a cycle, so they get fed
[03:24:44.400 --> 03:24:45.280]  multiple times a day.
[03:24:45.280 --> 03:24:47.840]  So they're getting plenty of opportunity to show me if they're happy or not.
[03:24:48.600 --> 03:24:49.840]  They look really, really good.
[03:24:50.680 --> 03:24:55.720]  I've always been intrigued by the, I mean, I'm an organic grower also
[03:24:55.800 --> 03:24:57.520]  because of the simplicity, right?
[03:24:57.560 --> 03:25:00.560]  But so I've always been intrigued by the simplicity of it.
[03:25:00.920 --> 03:25:04.480]  It's all, they send you like four powders and one liquid and weigh them out by the
[03:25:04.480 --> 03:25:05.000]  gram.
[03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:09.960]  Like there's a, so much per gallon, so many grams per gallon, you just weigh it
[03:25:09.960 --> 03:25:14.520]  out on a scale and just pour it in there and stir it real, real well and just let
[03:25:14.520 --> 03:25:14.760]  it go.
[03:25:14.760 --> 03:25:18.560]  I just let the reservoirs, I put huge pumps in the rest of the fucking spin real
[03:25:18.560 --> 03:25:18.800]  well.
[03:25:18.800 --> 03:25:20.520]  And the water is cyclone in there all the time.
[03:25:22.360 --> 03:25:25.400]  Unfortunately, it's hard to produce that much RO water.
[03:25:25.400 --> 03:25:27.880]  Can I, can I, uh, fill you on a little secret there?
[03:25:28.080 --> 03:25:28.640]  Let's hear it, buddy.
[03:25:30.080 --> 03:25:34.840]  Walmart has RO water or a dollar 59 a gallon.
[03:25:34.840 --> 03:25:38.920]  And if you go in there and fill up waters, like, like gallon bottles, it's 89
[03:25:38.920 --> 03:25:39.320]  cents.
[03:25:39.400 --> 03:25:40.320]  Water station.
[03:25:40.320 --> 03:25:41.840]  You can get it for like about 25.
[03:25:41.920 --> 03:25:42.200]  Okay.
[03:25:42.240 --> 03:25:44.080]  Well, I'm just saying like Walmart's are everywhere.
[03:25:44.680 --> 03:25:49.360]  So, um, you know, I, I'm not trying to pitch Walmart, but they have RO water
[03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:50.760]  gallons this morning.
[03:25:50.760 --> 03:25:53.080]  The cost alone out of our bed is going to be ridiculous.
[03:25:53.080 --> 03:25:53.640]  Well, yeah.
[03:25:53.640 --> 03:25:55.280]  I mean, if you're doing it, you're all right.
[03:25:55.320 --> 03:25:57.320]  And you know what I use a thousand gallons of water.
[03:25:57.320 --> 03:25:58.520]  I was thinking for the listeners.
[03:25:58.560 --> 03:25:59.160]  Well, you know what?
[03:25:59.200 --> 03:26:01.040]  A thousand gallons of water every other day.
[03:26:01.200 --> 03:26:04.120]  Well then we're in the same, get a fucking budget plan with them.
[03:26:04.120 --> 03:26:07.200]  Have them just back the truck in and be like, use water, bro.
[03:26:07.480 --> 03:26:07.760]  All right.
[03:26:07.800 --> 03:26:08.080]  Yeah.
[03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:13.360]  See, that's the reason I do that is actually, uh, vegetable actually sent us
[03:26:13.360 --> 03:26:13.720]  a mix.
[03:26:13.720 --> 03:26:17.680]  They sent us a two part mix that I use half one and half the other, and it
[03:26:17.680 --> 03:26:21.440]  balances the pH and adjust for my, I've tested the water and sent them some
[03:26:21.440 --> 03:26:22.000]  water tests.
[03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:24.720]  They sent us a formula for design for our water.
[03:26:25.080 --> 03:26:27.160]  So I mean, it changes across town.
[03:26:27.160 --> 03:26:27.640]  So for sure.
[03:26:27.640 --> 03:26:29.560]  It goes to six, five, if I mix it right.
[03:26:29.640 --> 03:26:31.000]  Dude, that's killer.
[03:26:31.040 --> 03:26:31.840]  Uh, it's Thursday.
[03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:33.440]  So the tank was getting about halfway down.
[03:26:33.440 --> 03:26:36.280]  So I just threw the hose in there and filled it up with water and let it spin
[03:26:36.520 --> 03:26:37.600]  at totally six, five.
[03:26:37.640 --> 03:26:37.760]  Yeah.
[03:26:37.760 --> 03:26:40.320]  The tank was all the way to the top and it's still at 6.5.
[03:26:40.480 --> 03:26:40.840]  Oh yeah.
[03:26:40.840 --> 03:26:41.040]  Yeah.
[03:26:41.040 --> 03:26:41.240]  Yeah.
[03:26:41.240 --> 03:26:41.440]  Yeah.
[03:26:41.440 --> 03:26:42.080]  It's pretty smooth.
[03:26:42.240 --> 03:26:43.000]  That would have been cool.
[03:26:43.280 --> 03:26:44.560]  I guess that's what's up.
[03:26:44.560 --> 03:26:44.720]  Dude.
[03:26:44.720 --> 03:26:49.920]  That's I mean, organic's great, but I mean, it took time.
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:51.160]  This is sustainable too.
[03:26:51.160 --> 03:26:55.120]  You just use one fucking product, you know, four packages.
[03:26:55.200 --> 03:26:58.720]  It sounds like our, our kind of a style of growing too.
[03:26:59.560 --> 03:27:04.400]  A very simple and simplistic and with the, this is more the round, a lot of
[03:27:04.400 --> 03:27:05.640]  the stuff growing a green and healthy.
[03:27:05.680 --> 03:27:10.800]  I used six bottles total, uh, the flowering cycle.
[03:27:11.320 --> 03:27:13.560]  Like total, like, and that's a B.
[03:27:13.600 --> 03:27:15.440]  And you have like a big flood system, right?
[03:27:15.440 --> 03:27:18.920]  That like runs back and forth or, um, yes.
[03:27:18.960 --> 03:27:21.320]  I mean, I, I don't, I, I don't want to give away your secret.
[03:27:21.320 --> 03:27:22.960]  It's just, I know they're tiered, right?
[03:27:22.960 --> 03:27:23.760]  Is what I'm saying.
[03:27:23.960 --> 03:27:25.400]  Uh, no, it's just tables at an angle.
[03:27:25.400 --> 03:27:25.840]  Okay.
[03:27:25.920 --> 03:27:29.320]  Tables, uh, flood, flood tables at an angle with pots with cocoa, essentially
[03:27:29.320 --> 03:27:30.520]  with a sprinkler in each pot.
[03:27:30.760 --> 03:27:31.560]  This is what I saw.
[03:27:31.560 --> 03:27:33.680]  I knew it seemed like they were at an angle, you know what I'm saying?
[03:27:33.680 --> 03:27:36.160]  It was a gigantic version of my little greenhouse.
[03:27:36.520 --> 03:27:36.880]  Man.
[03:27:36.920 --> 03:27:38.160]  Just it looks good though.

[03:31:35.960 --> 03:31:39.200]  So I put it away and then I go pull out the iPhone and stand in the bathroom and just
[03:31:39.200 --> 03:31:41.360]  use it and check all the messages so that nobody could see me.
[03:31:42.120 --> 03:31:42.840]  Then you go back to work.

[03:32:25.920 --> 03:32:27.040]  I'm going to insult you.
[03:32:27.240 --> 03:32:28.520]  I'm going to insult you, dude.
[03:32:28.680 --> 03:32:29.880]  I left my sandals on.
[03:32:29.880 --> 03:32:31.800]  You take your shoes off and in here.
[03:32:31.800 --> 03:32:33.760]  And I wouldn't let him take his sandals off.
[03:32:34.040 --> 03:32:34.920]  I kept them on, bro.
[03:32:34.920 --> 03:32:35.720]  I respect him.
[03:32:35.720 --> 03:32:36.240]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:32:36.240 --> 03:32:36.680]  Like, that's what's up.
[03:32:36.680 --> 03:32:38.360]  These greasy footprints across my carpet.
[03:32:38.360 --> 03:32:39.160]  Absolutely.
[03:32:41.280 --> 03:32:43.680]  It's like Harry and the Hendersons just walked through your fucking house.
[03:32:43.680 --> 03:32:44.160]  I feel you.
[03:32:45.800 --> 03:32:47.360]  Do you walk through tar on the way in here?
[03:32:47.360 --> 03:32:48.320]  What the fuck is this?
[03:32:48.320 --> 03:32:49.920]  Dude, my, like, that's what I'm saying.
[03:32:49.920 --> 03:32:52.040]  The dude that does the ankle monitor had to touch them today.
[03:32:52.040 --> 03:32:53.080]  I was like, dude, they don't smell.
[03:32:53.080 --> 03:32:53.760]  They just look like.
[03:32:54.720 --> 03:32:57.480]  It looks literally like I've walked through a cow field to get here, bro.
[03:32:57.840 --> 03:32:58.440]  I'm sorry.
[03:32:58.720 --> 03:32:59.880]  And he's like, dude, you're lucky.
[03:32:59.880 --> 03:33:00.400]  They don't stink.
[03:33:00.400 --> 03:33:03.240]  Cause I would have literally told you to go home and wash that shit and then come
[03:33:03.240 --> 03:33:03.520]  back.
[03:33:03.520 --> 03:33:07.480]  And I'd be like, dude, I live across town, but please, please don't you have a sink
[03:33:07.480 --> 03:33:07.920]  or something?
[03:33:07.920 --> 03:33:08.800]  I can get down to it.
[03:33:08.800 --> 03:33:11.920]  Like, you know, man living in the car life.
[03:33:12.400 --> 03:33:13.840]  Adam just hosing his feet off.
[03:33:13.880 --> 03:33:14.960]  Not even that bro.
[03:33:14.960 --> 03:33:16.720]  Like I'm strictly Jesus in it.
[03:33:16.720 --> 03:33:21.160]  Like with bowls by the fucking door, you know, like, yeah, that whole deal, you
[03:33:21.160 --> 03:33:22.280]  know, you gotta wash someone's feet.
[03:33:22.280 --> 03:33:23.120]  It makes you feel humble.
[03:33:23.560 --> 03:33:25.400]  It's all the life of real life.
[03:33:25.400 --> 03:33:28.360]  We choose the life of a pump.
[03:33:28.720 --> 03:33:31.640]  Uh, you know, those like, you know, the pump that you would use.
[03:33:33.240 --> 03:33:33.680]  Yes.
[03:33:35.080 --> 03:33:36.040]  And then it got stuck.
[03:33:36.040 --> 03:33:37.760]  I got one testicle stuck in it.
[03:33:40.720 --> 03:33:41.040]  I know.
[03:33:41.040 --> 03:33:41.640]  I got carried.
[03:33:41.640 --> 03:33:42.280]  You sure?
[03:33:42.280 --> 03:33:46.120]  Or do you know now is this after you were like, damn, this really hurts.
[03:33:46.120 --> 03:33:47.440]  Let me read the instructions.
[03:33:47.520 --> 03:33:48.000]  Fuck.
[03:33:48.160 --> 03:33:49.560]  You just blew every listener's head.
[03:33:49.720 --> 03:33:50.040]  Yeah.
[03:33:50.040 --> 03:33:50.320]  Yeah.
[03:33:51.200 --> 03:33:52.600]  Good job with that peeking out.
[03:33:52.720 --> 03:33:52.920]  Yeah.
[03:33:52.920 --> 03:33:53.720]  I got a compressor.
[03:33:53.760 --> 03:33:54.440]  I got a compressor.
[03:33:54.440 --> 03:33:56.480]  It stopped it, but Holy fucking wow.
[03:33:56.560 --> 03:33:58.080]  You didn't have it hooked up for me.
[03:33:58.520 --> 03:33:59.680]  It's not on Adam level.
[03:33:59.680 --> 03:34:00.320]  That's for sure.
[03:34:00.320 --> 03:34:03.240]  But between, between garage band, no, no, no.
[03:34:03.240 --> 03:34:04.040]  Do your thing, brother.
[03:34:04.040 --> 03:34:04.560]  Do your thing.
[03:34:04.640 --> 03:34:07.720]  So you know that, you know, the pumps you would use for like a water wand, you
[03:34:07.720 --> 03:34:11.160]  just throw it in a big container and you just fucking, I use those as stir pumps
[03:34:11.160 --> 03:34:12.440]  and a big 300 gallon tank.
[03:34:13.320 --> 03:34:16.160]  I use one of those and then I put some hose on it and then I run the host of
[03:34:16.160 --> 03:34:17.520]  something and clamp the host of something.
[03:34:17.520 --> 03:34:18.520]  So it stays in place.
[03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:20.160]  I could hear it slipping out.
[03:34:20.520 --> 03:34:24.480]  Like the hose was creeping while it was pumping and I ran to it to grab it and
[03:34:24.480 --> 03:34:29.520]  he came out, this hose shot water up my shorts, up my balls.
[03:34:31.520 --> 03:34:32.960]  I was like, how did that even go there?
[03:34:33.160 --> 03:34:35.400]  I was like, well, that was a little undercarriage rinses.
[03:34:35.400 --> 03:34:36.120]  Fucking awkward.
[03:34:36.560 --> 03:34:37.840]  Hashtag Colorado problems.
[03:34:37.840 --> 03:34:38.320]  Went up.
[03:34:38.320 --> 03:34:41.200]  My shirt got stuck in my shirt for a brief second.
[03:34:41.200 --> 03:34:42.600]  I tried to grab it and couldn't catch it.
[03:34:42.600 --> 03:34:43.280]  It slipped out.
[03:34:43.280 --> 03:34:44.880]  It went back up and hit me in the chin.
[03:34:44.880 --> 03:34:46.800]  It's great fucking nutrient.
[03:34:46.800 --> 03:34:48.720]  I got veg bloom up my nose.
[03:34:48.760 --> 03:34:52.680]  Like the water was coming out of my nose and eyes.
[03:34:53.040 --> 03:34:56.520]  All I could do was like reach to find the plug to turn off that fucking hose.
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:34:57.720]  It was fun.
[03:34:57.720 --> 03:35:03.120]  So today I solved it by fucking, uh, drilling a hole in the side of the
[03:35:03.120 --> 03:35:07.760]  rez because then wouldn't the res leak if I put a hole in it, put a tube coming
[03:35:07.760 --> 03:35:10.960]  out of it, but no, what I did was, uh, I took a cinder block and I fucking zip
[03:35:10.960 --> 03:35:12.480]  tied the hose to a cinder block.
[03:35:12.760 --> 03:35:14.760]  And I was like, I'm gonna do this fucking Italian style.
[03:35:15.400 --> 03:35:16.200]  A fucking water.
[03:35:16.880 --> 03:35:23.720]  And I fucking zip tied that fucking hose to a cinder block.
[03:35:23.720 --> 03:35:25.760]  I just fucking tie a brick and drop in the bottom of it.
[03:35:25.760 --> 03:35:26.680]  That's what the fuck I do.
[03:35:27.680 --> 03:35:28.840]  Fucking forget about it.
[03:35:28.840 --> 03:35:29.960]  Ain't a problem solved, man.
[03:35:35.160 --> 03:35:37.680]  They looked at me funny when I went to Lowe's and bought a bunch of zip ties
[03:35:37.680 --> 03:35:38.640]  and some cinder blocks.
[03:35:39.960 --> 03:35:40.760]  Who gives a fuck?
[03:35:40.760 --> 03:35:42.720]  I'd have been periscoping that shit the whole time.
[03:35:42.720 --> 03:35:44.280]  Like, look at this crazy bitch looking at me.
[03:35:44.280 --> 03:35:45.520]  Like I just killed somebody.
[03:35:45.800 --> 03:35:47.680]  I might have bitch don't cross the line.
[03:35:48.120 --> 03:35:49.160]  You want to get in the car?
[03:35:50.800 --> 03:35:51.760]  Measure in cinder blocks.
[03:35:51.760 --> 03:35:51.840]  Yeah.
[03:35:51.840 --> 03:35:52.680]  Three should be enough.
[03:35:53.560 --> 03:35:57.960]  Do you think this would like, say, keep a hose down to say if I really
[03:35:57.960 --> 03:36:03.320]  needed to keep it down, like it was life imperative, be real vague as
[03:36:03.320 --> 03:36:05.720]  possible because it is Lowe's and you can't talk about cannabis.
[03:36:05.720 --> 03:36:07.160]  So you have to be real vague.
[03:36:07.160 --> 03:36:08.840]  No, the old man at Lowe's asked me what I was trying to do.
[03:36:08.840 --> 03:36:11.320]  And I said, I needed some cinder blocks to keep my hose underwater.
[03:36:11.880 --> 03:36:13.080]  That's almost as good as it was.
[03:36:13.080 --> 03:36:16.540]  So yeah, I'm not going there.
[03:36:17.220 --> 03:36:17.500]  All right.
[03:36:17.540 --> 03:36:17.740]  Yep.
[03:36:17.780 --> 03:36:18.260]  All right.
[03:36:18.380 --> 03:36:18.780]  All right.
[03:36:18.780 --> 03:36:19.300]  All right.
[03:36:19.620 --> 03:36:20.300]  Okay.
[03:36:20.300 --> 03:36:20.820]  How you doing?
[03:36:20.820 --> 03:36:21.220]  Going though.
[03:36:21.220 --> 03:36:26.020]  So, uh, yeah, I don't know how long your episodes are, but dang, we used to
[03:36:26.020 --> 03:36:27.180]  have a break and some music.
[03:36:27.180 --> 03:36:28.180]  It's going to be long.
[03:36:28.180 --> 03:36:29.340]  I got to pee, man.
[03:36:29.340 --> 03:36:30.340]  Like you got to pee.
[03:36:30.340 --> 03:36:32.140]  You don't have a fucking podcaster bladder.
[03:36:32.380 --> 03:36:33.100]  I do.
[03:36:33.140 --> 03:36:35.500]  I'm sitting here with podcaster, but they're still drinking.
[03:36:35.500 --> 03:36:37.060]  I got that Joe Rogan bladder, bro.
[03:36:37.060 --> 03:36:38.060]  You ever listened to Joe Rogan?
[03:36:38.060 --> 03:36:39.700]  He's like, I went with YouTube.
[03:36:39.700 --> 03:36:40.740]  I'm like, I'm going to drink.
[03:36:40.740 --> 03:36:41.380]  I'm going to drink.
[03:36:41.380 --> 03:36:41.980]  I'm going to drink.
[03:36:42.260 --> 03:36:43.340]  I went with YouTube.
[03:36:43.340 --> 03:36:44.260]  See Joe Rogan.
[03:36:44.260 --> 03:36:46.660]  They wouldn't let us up or order food or drinks.
[03:36:46.780 --> 03:36:47.620]  We couldn't do shit.
[03:36:48.380 --> 03:36:50.420]  He was recording a fucking comedy special, bro.
[03:36:50.420 --> 03:36:50.580]  Yeah.
[03:36:50.580 --> 03:36:53.540]  When Jeff went by himself, he got first class service.
[03:36:53.700 --> 03:36:53.900]  Yeah.
[03:36:55.020 --> 03:36:56.420]  And he did get put in the front row.
[03:36:56.700 --> 03:36:57.500]  He went with me.
[03:36:57.500 --> 03:37:03.220]  They were like, yeah, pretty girl, but no, ain't happening.
[03:37:03.380 --> 03:37:07.420]  No, no, we got put, we got put like middle row, like right underneath the other.
[03:37:07.940 --> 03:37:12.220]  It was right as the, the, the, the audience stepped up like that, that step
[03:37:12.220 --> 03:37:17.020]  that I was directly under the camera is how far back the very back camera was
[03:37:17.020 --> 03:37:20.620]  right above my head and that cameraman had to view over my head.
[03:37:20.620 --> 03:37:23.140]  So Joe Rogan was telling jokes to that camera and it looked like
[03:37:23.140 --> 03:37:24.140]  he was talking to me all night.
[03:37:24.180 --> 03:37:24.820]  It was kind of fun.
[03:37:25.740 --> 03:37:28.140]  And he did the vegan and the grateful dead joke right at me.
[03:37:28.620 --> 03:37:29.260]  Like totally.
[03:37:31.020 --> 03:37:31.980]  Yeah, it was pretty freaky.
[03:37:32.500 --> 03:37:32.820]  Definitely.
[03:37:32.820 --> 03:37:33.660]  It was a good time.
[03:37:33.660 --> 03:37:37.020]  I catch a lot of shit for that, but that was well worth getting in trouble for it.
[03:37:37.020 --> 03:37:41.300]  That was one of those moments that like, you just got to say, fuck it and go do it.
[03:37:41.700 --> 03:37:42.060]  Yeah.
[03:37:42.220 --> 03:37:43.100]  And it was worth it, dude.
[03:37:43.100 --> 03:37:45.380]  Like that was, that was a very memorable experience.
[03:37:45.380 --> 03:37:47.180]  That you're a grown ass man and you can get in trouble.
[03:37:47.460 --> 03:37:48.660]  No, I can't.
[03:37:48.660 --> 03:37:49.860]  That like years ago.
[03:37:49.900 --> 03:37:51.700]  Are you, you're still getting shit for that?
[03:37:51.820 --> 03:37:52.660]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:37:52.900 --> 03:37:53.500]  Jeez.
[03:37:53.540 --> 03:37:57.700]  That, that, I'm just going to leave that alone and it's, I have to go.
[03:37:57.700 --> 03:37:59.380]  We need to learn how to catch and release.
[03:38:02.420 --> 03:38:03.420]  Goddamn you guys.
[03:38:04.580 --> 03:38:05.540]  You got no game, bro.
[03:38:06.540 --> 03:38:06.940]  Bro.
[03:38:07.180 --> 03:38:09.540]  I think, I think you need to nevermind.
[03:38:09.660 --> 03:38:10.740]  I'm leaving that alone too.
[03:38:13.180 --> 03:38:14.300]  You got something this week?
[03:38:14.300 --> 03:38:17.300]  No, not my wife.
[03:38:17.300 --> 03:38:18.180]  I can tell you that much.
[03:38:18.860 --> 03:38:20.620]  My wife, not her.
[03:38:21.180 --> 03:38:21.860]  Sorry.
[03:38:22.860 --> 03:38:23.900]  Very nice.
[03:38:24.940 --> 03:38:28.300]  So, uh, anyways, yeah, we got four listeners left.
[03:38:28.340 --> 03:38:28.620]  Yeah.
[03:38:28.620 --> 03:38:28.900]  Yeah.
[03:38:28.900 --> 03:38:30.180]  They've all checked the fuck out.
[03:38:31.540 --> 03:38:32.380]  Everything was good.
[03:38:32.380 --> 03:38:34.100]  Do you guys invited that fucking redneck?
[03:38:34.100 --> 03:38:34.660]  Who was that?
[03:38:35.580 --> 03:38:37.220]  What podcast did you send me to?
[03:38:37.220 --> 03:38:38.340]  Hillbillies and drunks.
[03:38:38.780 --> 03:38:40.220]  Why did I just decide to play with that?
[03:38:40.580 --> 03:38:41.100]  That's weird.
[03:38:41.220 --> 03:38:42.540]  I see why everybody plays with those ones.
[03:38:42.540 --> 03:38:43.660]  They take them off their water bottle.
[03:38:43.820 --> 03:38:44.660]  I usually don't do that.
[03:38:46.380 --> 03:38:49.660]  You've seen everybody else do it and you're like, well, I want to play with my
[03:38:49.660 --> 03:38:50.380]  little water bottle.
[03:38:50.620 --> 03:38:54.980]  I got my little, my little shower proof cap for my inclusion zone unit down here.

[03:38:56.620 --> 03:38:59.180]  Uh, uh, look, I tried to put it on my other ankle.
[03:38:59.300 --> 03:39:00.700]  What's your probation officer's name?
[03:39:00.820 --> 03:39:02.420]  Uh, I don't have a probation officer.
[03:39:02.420 --> 03:39:03.940]  I have a bail officer.
[03:39:03.980 --> 03:39:04.940]  What's your bail officer's name?
[03:39:04.940 --> 03:39:05.980]  Uh, Mitchell.
[03:39:06.220 --> 03:39:06.900]  Shout out Mitchell.
[03:39:06.900 --> 03:39:07.580]  Shout out Mitchell.
[03:39:08.220 --> 03:39:10.420]  Let me come record another podcast.
[03:39:10.420 --> 03:39:10.740]  Whoop.

[03:39:11.140 --> 03:39:11.380]  Yeah.
[03:39:11.380 --> 03:39:12.500]  Thanks for letting him come to my spot.
[03:39:12.500 --> 03:39:13.540]  Did you tell him where the fuck I live?
[03:39:13.660 --> 03:39:14.300]  He knows.
[03:39:14.380 --> 03:39:15.300]  Oh fuck.
[03:39:15.940 --> 03:39:17.580]  100% GPS on this.
[03:39:17.580 --> 03:39:20.700]  You know, you got to go dude.
[03:39:22.580 --> 03:39:25.100]  Hey, fictional characters, fictional characters.
[03:39:25.100 --> 03:39:26.140]  This is all made up.
[03:39:26.140 --> 03:39:27.220]  This is all fake.
[03:39:27.660 --> 03:39:28.380]  This is dude.
[03:39:28.420 --> 03:39:31.260]  I'd go in there looking exactly like I look like this.
[03:39:31.540 --> 03:39:32.940]  And he's like, can you work where?
[03:39:32.940 --> 03:39:34.700]  And I was like a pipe shop, bro.
[03:39:34.700 --> 03:39:39.420]  I sell people bongs, you know, like, Oh, strictly water pipes.
[03:39:39.660 --> 03:39:41.660]  Uh, but anyways, no, no, no, no.
[03:39:41.660 --> 03:39:43.700]  You know, it's like, dude, he, he gets it.
[03:39:43.740 --> 03:39:47.260]  You know, Colorado was like, do you have any weed in the car?
[03:39:47.260 --> 03:39:48.100]  And I was like, yes.
[03:39:48.140 --> 03:39:52.620]  Like, so yeah, they didn't know what they gave me my position to cannabis.
[03:39:52.620 --> 03:39:54.300]  They didn't take my cannabis.
[03:39:54.740 --> 03:39:57.380]  That was my first question in the court was like, excuse me, officer.
[03:39:57.580 --> 03:40:00.060]  Uh, on the day of question, did you collect any evidence?
[03:40:00.060 --> 03:40:00.500]  And he's here.
[03:40:00.540 --> 03:40:03.260]  And no, no, your honor.
[03:40:03.260 --> 03:40:03.980]  I did not.
[03:40:04.020 --> 03:40:05.740]  And I was like, take case closed in, right?
[03:40:06.460 --> 03:40:07.860]  It's literally exactly what I did.
[03:40:07.860 --> 03:40:10.500]  And everybody laughed in the courtroom and then they played the video and it was
[03:40:10.500 --> 03:40:13.780]  like, Hey, your honor, I'm just a grown man living in the car trying to keep my
[03:40:13.780 --> 03:40:19.500]  pussy warm and everybody laughed in the courtroom and he, the, the fucking, the
[03:40:19.500 --> 03:40:21.180]  cops, like just fighting it, dude.
[03:40:21.180 --> 03:40:22.540]  You could see it on his face.
[03:40:22.540 --> 03:40:25.500]  Like he's not mad then, but he was mad.
[03:40:25.540 --> 03:40:26.100]  Oh man.
[03:40:26.260 --> 03:40:30.180]  No, I can't believe the fucking cops showed up.
[03:40:30.940 --> 03:40:31.780]  Dude, I can't either.
[03:40:31.940 --> 03:40:33.780]  You must've made some kind of impression on him.
[03:40:34.420 --> 03:40:35.460]  Didn't have a lot to do.
[03:40:35.740 --> 03:40:39.420]  I was like, dude, I'm the most compliant stoner you're going to mess with all
[03:40:39.420 --> 03:40:39.700]  night.
[03:40:39.700 --> 03:40:41.020]  I was like, there's no excuse.
[03:40:41.020 --> 03:40:41.580]  I'm sorry.
[03:40:41.860 --> 03:40:44.740]  I know I'm smoking in my car, but I live here.
[03:40:47.180 --> 03:40:48.260]  I'm in pajama pants.
[03:40:48.260 --> 03:40:50.140]  My keys are back there in my real pants.
[03:40:50.140 --> 03:40:54.740]  Like, bro, I got my cat in my lap and I'm watching the star Wars movie.
[03:40:54.740 --> 03:40:55.340]  Give me a break.
[03:40:55.500 --> 03:40:57.260]  That's what you should have went to jail for.
[03:40:57.260 --> 03:40:57.500]  Yeah.
[03:40:57.500 --> 03:40:57.740]  Yeah.
[03:40:57.740 --> 03:40:58.060]  Watch it.
[03:41:00.980 --> 03:41:02.300]  That might've been part of the problem.
[03:41:02.300 --> 03:41:03.340]  That's probably why he showed up.
[03:41:03.340 --> 03:41:04.860]  Fucking check this out.
[03:41:04.860 --> 03:41:05.780]  It's still tears.
[03:41:05.780 --> 03:41:06.180]  Yeah.
[03:41:06.620 --> 03:41:06.860]  Yeah.
[03:41:06.860 --> 03:41:07.180]  Yeah.
[03:41:07.380 --> 03:41:07.580]  Yeah.
[03:41:07.660 --> 03:41:07.980]  Maybe.
[03:41:08.260 --> 03:41:09.100]  Can I watch it with you?
[03:41:09.100 --> 03:41:09.980]  You want to grab a seat?
[03:41:10.020 --> 03:41:11.380]  Like go sit in the cruiser.
[03:41:11.420 --> 03:41:11.700]  Like,
[03:41:13.500 --> 03:41:14.980]  bring your, bring your complaints.
[03:41:14.980 --> 03:41:15.700]  Probably better.
[03:41:15.860 --> 03:41:19.300]  Hey, I'm not going to drop his name, but he was the most racist person when he got
[03:41:19.300 --> 03:41:20.940]  back to his car and thought he was all alone.
[03:41:21.620 --> 03:41:24.540]  Like that dash, that, that chest camera still rolling brother.
[03:41:25.540 --> 03:41:28.580]  Like I literally had to tell your honor, we can, we can skip the
[03:41:28.580 --> 03:41:31.100]  racism and get back to my case.
[03:41:31.140 --> 03:41:31.700]  I forgot.
[03:41:32.140 --> 03:41:32.460]  Yeah.
[03:41:32.460 --> 03:41:32.820]  Yeah.
[03:41:32.820 --> 03:41:33.580]  He was dude.
[03:41:33.580 --> 03:41:34.220]  It was brutal.
[03:41:34.380 --> 03:41:35.940]  You know, it racist against you?
[03:41:36.020 --> 03:41:37.300]  No, no, no.
[03:41:37.340 --> 03:41:37.860]  I'm white.
[03:41:38.260 --> 03:41:38.460]  Yeah.
[03:41:38.460 --> 03:41:39.260]  That's what it's going to be.
[03:41:39.940 --> 03:41:40.740]  What was his name?
[03:41:40.740 --> 03:41:41.380]  Officer.
[03:41:41.460 --> 03:41:42.140]  No, don't go there.
[03:41:42.140 --> 03:41:42.820]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[03:41:42.820 --> 03:41:43.340]  Don't go there.
[03:41:43.340 --> 03:41:46.340]  I would just say it's what you do to a joint, you know?
[03:41:46.460 --> 03:41:46.780]  Okay.
[03:41:47.140 --> 03:41:48.340]  And it's definitely, yeah.
[03:41:48.540 --> 03:41:49.260]  We'll just leave it at that.
[03:41:49.260 --> 03:41:50.540]  His name was officer cells.
[03:41:50.700 --> 03:41:51.020]  Officer.
[03:41:52.540 --> 03:41:53.060]  Wow.
[03:41:53.420 --> 03:41:54.100]  That's out.
[03:41:54.140 --> 03:41:55.220]  That's all fictional officer.
[03:41:55.220 --> 03:41:56.940]  Fictional officer pass.
[03:41:58.620 --> 03:41:58.860]  Bro.
[03:41:58.860 --> 03:41:59.660]  I I'm fine.
[03:41:59.660 --> 03:42:00.380]  Yeah, I know.
[03:42:00.380 --> 03:42:01.260]  I know I'm retarded.
[03:42:01.260 --> 03:42:01.740]  Yeah, I know.
[03:42:01.740 --> 03:42:02.340]  I know you are.
[03:42:02.420 --> 03:42:05.260]  Well, I mean, you're looking at me like, I'm supposed to use the R word anymore.
[03:42:05.340 --> 03:42:06.020]  Oh, why not?
[03:42:06.020 --> 03:42:07.420]  Does that, does that hurt people's feelings?
[03:42:07.420 --> 03:42:07.980]  Incorrect.
[03:42:07.980 --> 03:42:08.860]  Well, yeah, it is.
[03:42:08.860 --> 03:42:12.820]  But I mean, dude, you're using it towards who's going to go.
[03:42:12.860 --> 03:42:13.220]  Yeah.
[03:42:13.300 --> 03:42:13.540]  Yeah.
[03:42:13.540 --> 03:42:14.100]  I am.
[03:42:15.300 --> 03:42:17.700]  There's a, that one's always kind of bothered me a little.
[03:42:17.780 --> 03:42:20.820]  Well, a dude who does videos on YouTube.
[03:42:21.380 --> 03:42:24.060]  It uses that word heavily though.
[03:42:24.060 --> 03:42:24.900]  And I'm heavily.
[03:42:25.460 --> 03:42:25.980]  Yeah.
[03:42:26.100 --> 03:42:29.060]  I mean, it's going to, who it is probably.
[03:42:29.060 --> 03:42:32.740]  If I don't think you watch, you're probably thinking of like walking dead stuff.
[03:42:32.740 --> 03:42:33.060]  Right?
[03:42:33.340 --> 03:42:33.860]  No, no.
[03:42:33.860 --> 03:42:36.380]  He's got a really big grow in Washington.
[03:42:36.860 --> 03:42:37.380]  Oh, I know.
[03:42:37.820 --> 03:42:38.180]  Yeah.
[03:42:38.500 --> 03:42:39.340]  I know exactly.
[03:42:39.340 --> 03:42:39.860]  Who, yeah.
[03:42:39.860 --> 03:42:40.140]  Okay.
[03:42:40.540 --> 03:42:41.700]  Hashtag YouTube growers.
[03:42:42.060 --> 03:42:43.060]  I heard.
[03:42:45.220 --> 03:42:46.060]  Do your research.
[03:42:46.140 --> 03:42:46.740]  It's all free.
[03:42:46.740 --> 03:42:47.900]  Do your research.
[03:42:48.300 --> 03:42:50.140]  Hey, I mean, bro.
[03:42:50.860 --> 03:42:57.060]  If my phone wasn't such a piece of shit, maybe once I get a better phone, I'd love to put your, like your podcast on and our podcast on down at the shop.
[03:42:57.060 --> 03:42:59.820]  I've been playing hash church because it'll play on YouTube.
[03:43:00.180 --> 03:43:01.380]  You guys have a computer down there?
[03:43:01.420 --> 03:43:05.780]  Well, we do, but it has no sound and it has no speakers and you need a password to put the speakers on it.
[03:43:05.820 --> 03:43:06.180]  That's.
[03:43:07.900 --> 03:43:08.900]  Then get the password.
[03:43:11.420 --> 03:43:13.780]  I get told that there is no password.
[03:43:16.020 --> 03:43:17.660]  Oh, you're not in the club then?
[03:43:17.740 --> 03:43:18.620]  I'm not an admin.
[03:43:18.620 --> 03:43:19.020]  You're right.
[03:43:19.660 --> 03:43:20.020]  I'm not.
[03:43:20.300 --> 03:43:20.860]  You're correct.
[03:43:21.500 --> 03:43:22.020]  So it's fine.
[03:43:22.300 --> 03:43:22.580]  It's cool.
[03:43:22.620 --> 03:43:23.020]  It's cool.
[03:43:23.180 --> 03:43:27.460]  We can play it over the loudspeakers through a phone because we have that, that, that we can plug into the phone.
[03:43:27.460 --> 03:43:28.020]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:43:28.020 --> 03:43:30.580]  And it, but my phone sucks.
[03:43:30.580 --> 03:43:36.660]  Cock sprint three G just saying, step it up to the game on blast.
[03:43:39.180 --> 03:43:39.860]  Shots fired.
[03:43:40.260 --> 03:43:41.620]  Wait, wait, lasers fired.
[03:43:42.060 --> 03:43:42.580]  Lasers.
[03:43:42.580 --> 03:43:42.860]  Fire.
[03:43:42.860 --> 03:43:43.340]  Wait, hold on.
[03:43:43.340 --> 03:43:43.620]  Hold on.
[03:43:45.700 --> 03:43:46.860]  You want to let him keep going?
[03:43:47.780 --> 03:43:48.420]  No, no, no.
[03:43:48.420 --> 03:43:49.420]  Don't let me keep going.
[03:43:49.420 --> 03:43:51.340]  My listeners have smashed their phones by now.
[03:43:51.380 --> 03:43:54.700]  They've unsubscribed to my show because of this episode.
[03:43:55.020 --> 03:43:58.860]  I'm going to, I'm going to try to get Jesse and Derek to stick around and do another fucking episode.
[03:43:58.860 --> 03:44:02.620]  I told you I was going to give you shit earlier, man.
[03:44:02.660 --> 03:44:03.900]  You sure I'm allowed here?
[03:44:03.900 --> 03:44:04.940]  You sure I was invited?
[03:44:05.300 --> 03:44:08.940]  I kind of feel like it's just like, so you guys still work with that fucking redneck.
[03:44:09.420 --> 03:44:12.380]  This is exactly what I expected from this podcast.
[03:44:12.980 --> 03:44:18.980]  No doubt that it would come to us talking about taking shits and random chaos.
[03:44:19.300 --> 03:44:21.420]  Hey, that's awesome.
[03:44:21.420 --> 03:44:22.620]  I didn't know it was going to start.
[03:44:22.620 --> 03:44:25.780]  We started, I didn't know it was going to start with us telling people to fuck their mom.
[03:44:26.140 --> 03:44:27.740]  I mean, it was a good podcast.
[03:44:27.740 --> 03:44:31.740]  Jesse tries to keep it like informational, you know, like he tries to bring the information to the table.
[03:44:31.740 --> 03:44:35.060]  But I mean, me and Derek pretty much ruined that at any point in time.
[03:44:36.300 --> 03:44:37.740]  It's just like, you know what, Derek, fuck you.
[03:44:37.740 --> 03:44:38.460]  And he's like, yeah.
[03:44:38.460 --> 03:44:39.140]  And I'm like, yeah.
[03:44:39.140 --> 03:44:39.740]  And he's like, yeah.
[03:44:39.740 --> 03:44:40.540]  And I'm like, yeah.
[03:44:40.780 --> 03:44:41.420]  I'll wrap it.
[03:44:41.460 --> 03:44:42.340]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:44:42.380 --> 03:44:48.140]  So we've had, you know, we've we've done stuff with that, you know, we've just sat around and bullshit with fools just been here.
[03:44:48.140 --> 03:44:49.700]  And it's like, why aren't we recording this?
[03:44:49.700 --> 03:44:52.580]  You know, like those memorable fucking stories are going down.
[03:44:52.580 --> 03:44:54.660]  And I, I would love to just listen to those.
[03:44:54.660 --> 03:44:59.020]  Like, I wish we had a private loop, you know, where there was some kind of private kind of podcast.
[03:45:00.140 --> 03:45:06.220]  You know, thing that you could you could do where pay us five hundred dollars an episode and you get the unfiltered.
[03:45:06.380 --> 03:45:07.100]  I have a website.
[03:45:07.100 --> 03:45:08.500]  I totally make that stuff happen.
[03:45:09.300 --> 03:45:12.020]  Content Colorado podcast dot com.
[03:45:12.820 --> 03:45:16.940]  So just plugging all over your show, huh?
[03:45:17.060 --> 03:45:18.180]  That's your show, too, bro.
[03:45:18.180 --> 03:45:20.100]  I know I feel like I'm just giving a shit.
[03:45:20.140 --> 03:45:21.980]  People are going to get double penetrated by the shows.
[03:45:22.020 --> 03:45:23.900]  Double. So what do you think of that?
[03:45:23.940 --> 03:45:24.660]  I'll take the mouth.
[03:45:25.900 --> 03:45:26.860]  I don't think that counts.
[03:45:27.180 --> 03:45:28.820]  Wait, what the fuck?
[03:45:30.380 --> 03:45:31.140]  That's no, no.
[03:45:31.140 --> 03:45:34.100]  People are getting GP, not you.
[03:45:34.380 --> 03:45:35.100]  If he wants it.
[03:45:35.100 --> 03:45:38.140]  No, I said I want Derek step right up to the plate.
[03:45:38.140 --> 03:45:39.140]  Like it's Colorado.
[03:45:39.140 --> 03:45:39.940]  It's welcome here.
[03:45:39.940 --> 03:45:41.180]  It's fine. I'll take the mouth.
[03:45:43.020 --> 03:45:43.500]  It's cool.
[03:45:43.500 --> 03:45:43.900]  It's cool.
[03:45:43.900 --> 03:45:44.740]  I'm not hating.
[03:45:44.740 --> 03:45:46.580]  I was referencing Adam open his mouth.
[03:45:46.580 --> 03:45:47.460]  Realize what he said?
[03:45:49.620 --> 03:45:51.140]  My listeners have been assaulted.
[03:45:51.140 --> 03:45:52.540]  I fuck reptiles.
[03:45:52.540 --> 03:45:54.380]  Do you think he brought the steps to it?
[03:45:54.420 --> 03:45:56.060]  Can anyone still listening?
[03:45:56.060 --> 03:45:57.420]  He's completely unsubscribe.
[03:45:57.940 --> 03:46:00.260]  This is definitely going to be like a Thursday bonus episode.
[03:46:02.180 --> 03:46:03.340]  Not going up main week.
[03:46:03.380 --> 03:46:03.820]  I don't know.
[03:46:03.820 --> 03:46:05.020]  This could be a main Monday episode.
[03:46:05.180 --> 03:46:07.540]  People might send me some funky ass emails.
[03:46:07.540 --> 03:46:09.380]  You guys, I'd love to hear your emails on my show.
[03:46:10.140 --> 03:46:13.740]  Either either show that you if you're hearing me on my on my feed, email me.
[03:46:13.740 --> 03:46:14.100]  It's good for me.
[03:46:14.100 --> 03:46:15.060]  Hard to hotmail dot com.
[03:46:15.060 --> 03:46:15.780]  Do you know what you think?
[03:46:15.780 --> 03:46:18.980]  If you're listening to me on the Colorado podcast, do it again.
[03:46:18.980 --> 03:46:19.620]  Email me.

[03:46:20.940 --> 03:46:21.700]  I want to do it.
[03:46:21.700 --> 03:46:24.620]  What you guys are thinking of this fucking chaotic random show here.
[03:46:25.020 --> 03:46:26.780]  I want to know what you want to know.
[03:46:26.780 --> 03:46:30.340]  I mean, I could call it a whole nother new kind of shit.
[03:46:30.340 --> 03:46:30.860]  Could. Yeah.
[03:46:30.860 --> 03:46:33.180]  Well, there's definitely another podcast here in the works.
[03:46:33.180 --> 03:46:35.380]  I just wish we all had fucking seven hours to record tonight.
[03:46:35.620 --> 03:46:37.220]  Oh, she's right.
[03:46:37.220 --> 03:46:38.860]  Shit. I still got to go fucking.
[03:46:38.860 --> 03:46:41.780]  I got I actually have a decent name for that.
[03:46:41.780 --> 03:46:44.820]  But I mean, for your podcast, too, as well.
[03:46:44.860 --> 03:46:46.180]  I thought of one the other day. Yeah.
[03:46:46.180 --> 03:46:47.660]  And don't say it.
[03:46:47.660 --> 03:46:48.660]  I'm not. Don't say it.
[03:46:48.660 --> 03:46:49.540]  I don't say it.
[03:46:49.540 --> 03:46:50.660]  We're going to steal it.
[03:46:50.660 --> 03:46:54.500]  Everybody in this group right now is on that that I can own your domain name.
[03:46:54.540 --> 03:46:57.020]  Yeah, I'm saying, hey, bro,
[03:46:57.660 --> 03:46:59.260]  don't go telling everybody that on the podcast.
[03:46:59.260 --> 03:47:00.940]  Oh, it's out there.
[03:47:00.940 --> 03:47:03.500]  I park domain names all day long.
[03:47:03.500 --> 03:47:04.740]  You know, I bought a new one.
[03:47:04.740 --> 03:47:07.860]  I know you've already been on that hype for a few years, but Jesse just found that
[03:47:07.860 --> 03:47:11.220]  hype and he's like, you know, I can fuck with my friends pretty hard.
[03:47:11.220 --> 03:47:13.060]  Go ahead. Go ahead.
[03:47:13.060 --> 03:47:14.860]  Yeah. Still open.
[03:47:14.860 --> 03:47:16.860]  And I wouldn't really call these people friends.
[03:47:17.060 --> 03:47:19.700]  Well, yeah.
[03:47:19.700 --> 03:47:21.900]  If your friends close and.
[03:47:21.900 --> 03:47:24.340]  The other ones closer on Facebook.
[03:47:25.020 --> 03:47:26.420]  I just don't know their domains.
[03:47:26.420 --> 03:47:28.140]  Just hate. Follow them on Facebook.
[03:47:28.140 --> 03:47:29.060]  Yeah.
[03:47:29.460 --> 03:47:31.460]  Make troll accounts and follow their Instagram.
[03:47:31.460 --> 03:47:33.020]  Oh, no, no, no.
[03:47:33.020 --> 03:47:33.620]  That's too much.
[03:47:33.620 --> 03:47:35.060]  I don't want to hear that from you.
[03:47:35.060 --> 03:47:35.780]  Put your phone down.
[03:47:35.780 --> 03:47:37.500]  Depends on how committed you are.
[03:47:37.500 --> 03:47:39.460]  You're way too committed to the whole trolling.
[03:47:39.740 --> 03:47:41.580]  Yeah. Get on Snapchat.
[03:47:41.580 --> 03:47:44.900]  Rub on. If you can't like do it with your own real account.
[03:47:44.980 --> 03:47:46.540]  It's not really worth the effort.
[03:47:46.540 --> 03:47:50.660]  You know, I guess it's been an hour and 40 minutes.
[03:47:50.860 --> 03:47:53.060]  Holy shit. My listeners have shot themselves.
[03:47:54.860 --> 03:47:56.420]  I hope you're going to edit this.
[03:47:56.420 --> 03:47:58.140]  I'm putting it up just like it is, bro.
[03:47:58.140 --> 03:47:58.980]  I'm pretty high.
[03:47:58.980 --> 03:48:01.060]  There's no way it's going to go on ours in one episode.
[03:48:01.060 --> 03:48:01.780]  We're going to have to cut it.
[03:48:01.780 --> 03:48:03.460]  We can get it on the website.
[03:48:03.460 --> 03:48:04.620]  Oh, yeah, we can do that.
[03:48:04.620 --> 03:48:06.580]  Like a special episode just from the website or something.
[03:48:06.580 --> 03:48:08.660]  If you want me to edit it down to a solid hour, we can do that.
[03:48:08.660 --> 03:48:10.700]  Oh, no, I could put it up on SoundCloud.
[03:48:11.220 --> 03:48:13.260]  We could do it as two episodes in one week.
[03:48:13.700 --> 03:48:15.540]  I mean, just all in one.
[03:48:15.540 --> 03:48:16.140]  All right.
[03:48:16.140 --> 03:48:19.620]  Let's let's not argue about this while we're wasting precious time.
[03:48:20.460 --> 03:48:21.740]  All right, you guys.
[03:48:21.860 --> 03:48:24.140]  This is the end of this part of the show.
[03:48:24.140 --> 03:48:27.460]  If you're listening on my feed, I'm going to come back and talk in a minute.
[03:48:27.540 --> 03:48:31.620]  So listen to music on my feed and we'll probably do the same thing.
[03:48:32.020 --> 03:48:32.580]  Yeah.
[03:48:32.580 --> 03:48:33.780]  Hard cut.
[03:48:33.780 --> 03:48:34.860]  Yeah. Yeah.
[03:48:34.860 --> 03:48:35.860]  I think.
[03:48:35.980 --> 03:48:38.140]  Yeah, I think we just want to record post-production.
[03:48:38.180 --> 03:48:40.020]  You're going to tell everybody say goodbye.
[03:48:40.020 --> 03:48:42.620]  Hey, guys, thanks for coming to my house and hanging out and doing a kickass podcast.
[03:48:42.620 --> 03:48:44.020]  Yeah, I definitely appreciate it.
[03:48:44.020 --> 03:48:46.300]  I apologize to my listeners for not talking a lot about cannabis,
[03:48:46.300 --> 03:48:47.500]  but this was a lot of fucking fun.
[03:48:47.500 --> 03:48:48.820]  Adam, you're not as crazy as you think you are.
[03:48:48.820 --> 03:48:49.380]  It's a lot of fun.
[03:48:49.380 --> 03:48:50.020]  Dude, you're quiet.
[03:48:50.020 --> 03:48:50.700]  You should talk more.
[03:48:50.700 --> 03:48:52.620]  And dude, you're really good at podcasting.
[03:48:52.620 --> 03:48:53.500]  Thank you.
[03:48:53.500 --> 03:48:54.340]  I'm high.
[03:48:54.340 --> 03:48:55.220]  I apologize.
[03:48:55.220 --> 03:48:56.580]  You're pretty good at podcasting.
[03:48:56.580 --> 03:48:57.540]  Yeah, sure.
[03:48:57.540 --> 03:48:59.140]  I better be by now, but thank you.
[03:48:59.260 --> 03:49:02.260]  Yeah, I'm going to hit stop on this for sure.
