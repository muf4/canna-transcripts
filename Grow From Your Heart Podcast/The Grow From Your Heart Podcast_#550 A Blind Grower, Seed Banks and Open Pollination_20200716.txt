[01:11.550 --> 01:12.550]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[01:12.550 --> 01:13.550]  Thanks man.
[01:13.550 --> 01:14.550]  What's up everybody.
[01:14.550 --> 01:16.510]  Thank you for being here, dude.
[01:16.510 --> 01:21.570]  Before we get too far, would you like to shout out how people can stalk you on social media?

[01:28.490 --> 01:32.490]  up on Patreon at a Patreon forward slash white Mike.
[01:32.490 --> 01:33.490]  There you go.
[01:33.490 --> 01:37.410]  Patreon.com forward slash white Mike help out white Mike for helping out the show.
[01:37.410 --> 01:39.650]  As Patreon is building up, we do appreciate the support.
[01:39.650 --> 01:43.170]  Mike is a major contributor, not only to the podcast, but to the community.
[01:43.170 --> 01:44.170]  Yes, you are, bro.
[01:44.170 --> 01:45.170]  You are getting it going.
[01:45.170 --> 01:49.290]  I'm glad I encouraged you to get the Patreon going and thank you to everybody who's helped
[01:49.290 --> 01:52.330]  out Mike's Patreon.
[01:52.330 --> 01:55.130]  This is the point of the show where I ask you, what are you smoking on today, bro?
[01:55.130 --> 01:58.050]  Everything I can get my damn hands on, man.
[01:58.050 --> 02:00.130]  You seem like that today.
[02:00.130 --> 02:02.330]  It's I've been enjoying 710 so much.
[02:02.330 --> 02:03.930]  I haven't gotten around to posting about it.
[02:03.930 --> 02:05.610]  It's fucking like 717 now.
[02:05.610 --> 02:06.610]  Yeah, it is.
[02:06.610 --> 02:07.610]  Oh, well don't reveal too much.
[02:07.610 --> 02:09.570]  We're actually recording on 715 yet.
[02:09.570 --> 02:12.690]  My voice still sounds raspy, bro.
[02:12.690 --> 02:16.490]  It's been five days and I dabbed myself into a throat thing.
[02:16.490 --> 02:21.090]  So if I sound weird on the show, we're pleasantly politely blaming 710.
[02:21.090 --> 02:22.090]  It was my fault.
[02:22.090 --> 02:23.090]  I didn't hydrate properly.
[02:23.090 --> 02:25.090]  I took away just enough too many dabs.
[02:25.090 --> 02:26.090]  Had a wonderful 710.
[02:26.090 --> 02:27.170]  I hope you had a good weekend too, bro.
[02:27.170 --> 02:28.730]  We didn't get to hang out.
[02:28.730 --> 02:30.610]  We're both doing our own thing so much lately.
[02:30.610 --> 02:31.610]  COVID.
[02:31.610 --> 02:33.610]  It sounds like a Jay-Z song.
[02:33.610 --> 02:34.610]  COVID.
[02:34.610 --> 02:39.650]  It's just, that's the reason for everything in 2020, man.
[02:39.650 --> 02:41.450]  That is the reason for most of everything right now.
[02:41.450 --> 02:43.050]  I'm going to fade that music out.
[02:43.050 --> 02:44.730]  710 was spectacular.
[02:44.730 --> 02:45.730]  Had a lot of fun.
[02:45.970 --> 02:47.970]  Consumed a lot of good product.
[02:47.970 --> 02:54.090]  Didn't get to go anywhere or see any buddy that's not family, but still had fun.
[02:54.090 --> 02:55.090]  Kind of different this year, huh?
[02:55.090 --> 02:57.410]  Not going out and kind of different.
[02:57.410 --> 02:59.610]  Not going to an event and being at the booth.
[02:59.610 --> 03:01.930]  For 710, I've usually got a booth at some event.
[03:01.930 --> 03:05.010]  We've got people coming up and saying hi from all over the place.
[03:05.010 --> 03:08.330]  I usually take a plethora of concentrates and we dab out with everybody.
[03:08.330 --> 03:10.890]  It was kind of a bummer not to get to see everybody.
[03:10.890 --> 03:12.770]  I'm going to need...
[03:12.770 --> 03:13.770]  Go ahead, Bryke.
[03:13.770 --> 03:14.770]  You cut me off.
[03:14.810 --> 03:18.130]  I've got a sore throat, but I know it's not cup throat.
[03:18.130 --> 03:21.010]  We didn't pass around our own little stoner plague this year.
[03:21.010 --> 03:22.170]  No cup cough this year.
[03:22.170 --> 03:24.410]  I wish we could.
[03:24.410 --> 03:28.370]  I would take cup cough just to have a cup right now.
[03:28.370 --> 03:29.370]  I think.
[03:29.370 --> 03:30.370]  I think.
[03:30.370 --> 03:31.370]  I say that now, but after a while.
[03:31.370 --> 03:33.370]  I wish we could be that normal again, man.
[03:33.370 --> 03:34.370]  That'd be nice.
[03:34.370 --> 03:35.370]  Me too.
[03:35.370 --> 03:37.610]  Shout out to all the people that I would have seen at an event.
[03:37.610 --> 03:38.850]  I can't wait to see you.
[03:38.850 --> 03:40.530]  We're going to need a big...
[03:40.530 --> 03:41.530]  What did we miss?
[03:41.530 --> 03:42.870]  We missed Easter.
[03:42.870 --> 03:44.970]  We missed St. Patrick's Day.
[03:44.970 --> 03:46.970]  We missed 420.
[03:46.970 --> 03:48.650]  We missed Earth Day.
[03:48.650 --> 03:50.170]  We missed a whole bunch of good shit.
[03:50.170 --> 03:55.430]  Then Cinco de Mayo and then summer and then 710.
[03:55.430 --> 03:57.530]  And then August is going to be fall.
[03:57.530 --> 03:59.050]  We're going to get screwed on.
[03:59.050 --> 04:01.050]  We're already wearing a mask.
[04:01.050 --> 04:02.730]  Yeah, no fish at Dick's this year.
[04:02.730 --> 04:03.730]  Don't break my heart, bro.
[04:03.730 --> 04:06.330]  But the good part is I've already got tickets for next year.
[04:06.330 --> 04:08.690]  The hardest part about going to a fish show is getting the damn tickets.
[04:08.690 --> 04:11.930]  So I'm set up for when they hopefully get to go next year.
[04:12.790 --> 04:14.590]  We're set up for Halloween, dude.
[04:14.590 --> 04:15.590]  We're already wearing a mask.
[04:15.590 --> 04:19.590]  Yeah, it's been a strange fucking year.
[04:19.590 --> 04:21.710]  And it's only getting stranger, man.
[04:21.710 --> 04:23.670]  It's... the ride ain't over.
[04:23.670 --> 04:26.230]  It feels like you're on a roller coaster and we're still going up.
[04:26.230 --> 04:30.230]  Like it hasn't tipped over yet, I don't think.
[04:30.230 --> 04:32.110]  I don't know how I feel about that statement, Mike.
[04:32.110 --> 04:33.110]  I don't know.
[04:33.110 --> 04:34.110]  Get a fucking helmet, people.
[04:34.110 --> 04:37.150]  I like to hope that we're maybe trying to make some progress at this point.
[04:37.150 --> 04:38.150]  But you're right.
[04:38.150 --> 04:41.830]  I'm going to put this back on track as a weed show.
[04:42.730 --> 04:43.730]  It's donor time.
[04:43.730 --> 04:45.890]  Mike is smoking some fucking Ramble Box concentrates over there.
[04:45.890 --> 04:49.690]  I saw him consume something a minute ago and it was a bigger cloud of smoke than I'm used
[04:49.690 --> 04:50.690]  to seeing.
[04:50.690 --> 04:51.690]  Lemon, sour, ambrosia.
[04:51.690 --> 04:52.690]  Sour, ambrosia.
[04:52.690 --> 04:55.810]  It's looking good, bro.
[04:55.810 --> 04:56.810]  Can we see the concentrate?
[04:56.810 --> 04:57.810]  Is there any left in the jar there?
[04:57.810 --> 04:58.810]  That's what I'm working on next.
[04:58.810 --> 04:59.810]  There you go.
[04:59.810 --> 05:00.810]  See if I can get it.
[05:00.810 --> 05:02.010]  Yeah, but tip it back because you're going to spill it now.
[05:02.010 --> 05:03.010]  So get it back to upright.
[05:03.010 --> 05:05.370]  I mean, like put it down normal because you're going to spill it.
[05:05.370 --> 05:06.370]  There you go.
[05:06.370 --> 05:07.370]  Yeah, we saw it.
[05:07.370 --> 05:08.370]  Good shot, dude.
[05:08.370 --> 05:09.370]  I just don't want you to spill the turps.
[05:09.370 --> 05:10.370]  We're about to leak out the jar.
[05:10.370 --> 05:11.370]  I was watching it.
[05:11.870 --> 05:12.870]  I'm not going to spill it.
[05:12.870 --> 05:15.470]  I wanted everybody hitting us up on YouTube to get a good look.
[05:15.470 --> 05:16.470]  Yeah.
[05:16.470 --> 05:17.470]  Thanks for watching on YouTube.
[05:17.470 --> 05:18.470]  Good reminder, bro.
[05:18.470 --> 05:20.750]  We are on YouTube also.
[05:20.750 --> 05:23.270]  A lot of people are used to us being on the audio formats.
[05:23.270 --> 05:27.750]  We're available on Spotify, of course, Apple podcasts and of course, Stitcher and many
[05:27.750 --> 05:31.590]  other audio formats, but we are also available on the YouTube.
[05:31.590 --> 05:32.970]  So check us out on YouTube.
[05:32.970 --> 05:34.250]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[05:34.250 --> 05:36.750]  Of course, click subscribe, press on the little bell.
[05:36.750 --> 05:39.550]  That way you get a notification every time I come out and put a new episode.
[05:39.550 --> 05:40.550]  Sometimes Mike is with me.
[05:40.550 --> 05:43.750]  I'm going to have more guests in the future, but join us.
[05:43.750 --> 05:45.250]  I invite you to find us on YouTube.
[05:45.250 --> 05:47.950]  I am smoking, since somebody was polite enough to ask,
[05:47.950 --> 05:50.750]  I'm smoking Garlic Grove Live Batter.
[05:50.750 --> 05:53.250]  I've got a four-gram jar of the Garlic Grove.
[05:53.250 --> 05:56.550]  On the label it says GMO Cookies and LOAF2.
[05:56.550 --> 06:00.550]  The flavor is described as General Tso's Garlic and Orange Soda.
[06:00.550 --> 06:03.750]  I've mentioned before, the thing they lack to put on the jar here
[06:03.750 --> 06:05.350]  is just a punch.
[06:05.350 --> 06:07.350]  It's just have a fist, because when you open it up,
[06:07.350 --> 06:08.750]  it's like a pleasant jack-in-the-box.
[06:08.750 --> 06:11.650]  It's like you open the jar and kapow, right in the face.
[06:11.650 --> 06:12.450]  It is delicious.
[06:12.450 --> 06:13.850]  It's tremendous.
[06:13.850 --> 06:16.450]  It has got me stoned, but talkative.
[06:16.450 --> 06:18.650]  I love this concentrate for the podcast.
[06:18.650 --> 06:19.450]  It tastes really good.
[06:19.450 --> 06:20.750]  I like the buzz.
[06:20.750 --> 06:22.350]  I like the way the batter hits.
[06:22.350 --> 06:24.550]  For 7-10, I smoked Shatter.
[06:24.550 --> 06:26.050]  I smoked CRC Concentrate.
[06:26.050 --> 06:27.350]  I smoked Wax.
[06:27.350 --> 06:29.250]  I smoked a little bit of everything.
[06:29.250 --> 06:31.150]  And you can hear it in my voice right now.
[06:31.150 --> 06:34.350]  My favorite is always this Green Dot Labs Alive Batter.
[06:34.350 --> 06:35.950]  Something about the way that it just rips.
[06:35.950 --> 06:36.850]  It makes big clouds.
[06:36.850 --> 06:37.850]  It feels good in my lungs.
[06:37.850 --> 06:40.550]  And I'm always heavily medicated from it.
[06:40.550 --> 06:44.650]  On the back, it does say it contains 68.24% THC
[06:44.650 --> 06:48.050]  and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[06:48.050 --> 06:49.050]  I like that blend.
[06:49.050 --> 06:50.350]  It seems to be working for me.
[06:50.350 --> 06:52.350]  That's the amount of THC I needed today.
[06:52.350 --> 06:53.950]  Big shout-out to our friends at Green Dot Labs
[06:53.950 --> 06:57.750]  for the Garlic Grove Live Batter.
[06:57.750 --> 06:59.150]  I feel like we've been going for a long time.
[06:59.150 --> 07:01.250]  We haven't covered much ground yet today, bro.
[07:01.250 --> 07:04.450]  We got talkative right at the top of the show.
[07:04.450 --> 07:05.050]  Keep it up, bro.
[07:05.050 --> 07:06.250]  Please don't stop.
[07:06.250 --> 07:06.850]  I love it.
[07:06.850 --> 07:08.650]  Hashtag, they love it when we ramble.
[07:08.650 --> 07:11.650]  Last episode, one of the messages right at the end
[07:11.650 --> 07:12.550]  was more white Mike.
[07:12.550 --> 07:14.650]  So if you wanted it, you got it, folks.
[07:14.650 --> 07:15.450]  Abracadabra.
[07:15.450 --> 07:15.950]  I told you.
[07:15.950 --> 07:18.350]  If you didn't want it, that's atnemopunk15.
[07:18.350 --> 07:19.850]  Let me know.
[07:19.850 --> 07:22.250]  You guys, we got him at just the right night, too.
[07:22.250 --> 07:22.950]  He's on Monday night.
[07:22.950 --> 07:23.650]  Good job, Mike.
[07:23.650 --> 07:24.750]  I'm in a good mood, too.
[07:24.750 --> 07:26.050]  It's just I needed this.
[07:26.050 --> 07:27.850]  So two guys coughing.
[07:27.850 --> 07:28.550]  Let's do it.
[07:28.550 --> 07:29.050]  Here we go.
[07:29.050 --> 07:30.150]  This is fun, bro.
[07:30.150 --> 07:32.050]  I love hanging out with you and doing these kind of episodes.
[07:32.050 --> 07:33.150]  What's on deck, bro?
[07:33.150 --> 07:35.550]  On deck is the 710 Club.
[07:35.550 --> 07:38.250]  This is the portion of the show where we give shout outs to the people
[07:38.250 --> 07:42.050]  who support us on Patreon at the $710 level or higher.
[07:42.050 --> 07:44.050]  I call them the 710 Club.
[07:44.050 --> 07:47.850]  I wish I had some sort of like drum sound right now.
[07:47.850 --> 07:48.650]  I will get one.
[07:48.650 --> 07:49.450]  That's what we're missing.
[07:49.450 --> 07:50.850]  So it'd be the 710 Club.
[07:50.850 --> 07:52.050]  Here.
[07:52.050 --> 07:53.750]  More equipment.
[07:53.750 --> 07:54.650]  No, it's just a button.
[07:54.650 --> 07:56.050]  We'll make it happen.
[07:56.050 --> 07:57.650]  We'll do it in post.
[07:57.650 --> 07:58.050]  I don't know.
[07:58.050 --> 07:59.450]  Maybe I'll get stoned and forget.
[07:59.450 --> 08:01.050]  It's a good idea.
[08:01.050 --> 08:03.550]  Anyway, let's move forward and give some shout outs to the bad
[08:03.550 --> 08:06.450]  motherfuckers who support us on the 710 Club.
[08:06.450 --> 08:08.650]  Let's start off with the big grow from your heart podcast.

[10:10.450 --> 10:11.450]  Let's get to it.
[10:11.550 --> 10:15.050]  We were getting to it brother most of the time when somebody sends me a
[10:15.050 --> 10:16.050]  grow question.
[10:16.150 --> 10:17.850]  I am filled with wisdom and answers.
[10:17.850 --> 10:20.750]  I feel 99% confident this time.
[10:20.750 --> 10:21.450]  I was like, oh shit.
[10:21.450 --> 10:22.250]  I don't know what to say.
[10:22.550 --> 10:25.150]  I'm going to have to reach out to Mike and some other people and see if
[10:25.150 --> 10:26.650]  we can come up with some ideas.
[10:26.950 --> 10:28.650]  So this one is very interesting.
[10:28.650 --> 10:29.850]  It says hey Rasta Jeff.
[10:29.850 --> 10:31.550]  Thank you so much for the awesome.
[10:31.550 --> 10:33.050]  Am I holding this paper in front of the camera?
[10:33.050 --> 10:34.350]  No, I don't want to block myself out.
[10:34.350 --> 10:35.450]  It says Rasta Jeff.
[10:35.450 --> 10:38.550]  Thank you so much for the awesome information and for your videos.
[10:38.650 --> 10:43.350]  I am totally blind and I am currently teaching myself to grow marijuana.
[10:43.650 --> 10:46.250]  I live in the state of Oklahoma and I have a medical card.
[10:46.250 --> 10:51.350]  I've smoked marijuana for the majority of my life 25 years now and I remember
[10:51.550 --> 10:56.750]  what mature plants look like but I never had any valuable hands-on experience
[10:56.950 --> 10:58.150]  while I could see.
[10:58.250 --> 11:01.950]  Now I'm trying to teach myself to grow blind and I'm using the resources you
[11:01.950 --> 11:05.650]  suggested in the 401st episode of your podcast.
[11:05.850 --> 11:09.050]  There are things that I'm running into though and I don't really know how to
[11:09.050 --> 11:09.850]  handle them.
[11:10.750 --> 11:15.950]  Wow, this guy got further than I ever think I would if I were blind and trying
[11:15.950 --> 11:16.450]  to grow.
[11:16.650 --> 11:18.450]  This guy has made success.
[11:18.450 --> 11:21.550]  He's gotten somewhere that's way further than I feel like I could have gotten.
[11:21.550 --> 11:22.250]  I'm proud of this guy.
[11:22.250 --> 11:23.050]  I'm impressed.
[11:23.550 --> 11:24.150]  Oh for sure.
[11:24.150 --> 11:26.550]  It's that's tricky.
[11:26.550 --> 11:32.050]  There's so much stuff that's I'm automatically go will you just check the
[11:32.050 --> 11:32.550]  meter?
[11:33.350 --> 11:40.050]  This stuff like how you look for light leaks problem solving all the little
[11:40.050 --> 11:44.150]  pieces and this is going to get tricky but like in a fun way if you like
[11:44.150 --> 11:45.450]  puzzles, right?
[11:45.650 --> 11:48.350]  He does have I've read this message and he does have somebody that helps him
[11:48.350 --> 11:48.550]  out.
[11:48.550 --> 11:50.350]  He's blessed with somebody that helps him out.
[11:50.350 --> 11:51.150]  So we're going to keep going.
[11:51.150 --> 11:53.250]  It says there are things I'm running into that.
[11:53.250 --> 11:54.450]  I don't really know how to handle.
[11:54.650 --> 12:00.550]  I'm lucky that my wife can see and she helps me with what she can man big
[12:00.550 --> 12:02.050]  thanks for having an amazing wife.
[12:02.050 --> 12:06.150]  That's however, but yeah, however, I am dead set on learning to do this with
[12:06.150 --> 12:07.750]  my own two hands.
[12:07.850 --> 12:11.750]  If you were willing to toss me any advice and share your wisdom, it would
[12:11.750 --> 12:12.950]  be greatly appreciated.
[12:12.950 --> 12:17.750]  Also, my situation is a unique one, but I am only I'm not the only blind
[12:17.750 --> 12:21.750]  person out there growing once I have stuff figured out and I have a firm
[12:21.750 --> 12:22.850]  hold on a solid grow.
[12:22.850 --> 12:27.550]  I will start putting up videos until then I have to conquer each aspect of
[12:27.550 --> 12:31.250]  growing and make sure that when I distribute information regarding growing
[12:31.250 --> 12:35.750]  blind, I'm giving information that is useful and will help other blind people
[12:35.750 --> 12:37.550]  love and enjoy cannabis.
[12:38.550 --> 12:43.350]  Dude, that is such a fucking awesome aspiration goal.
[12:43.850 --> 12:45.050]  Well thought out plan.
[12:45.050 --> 12:45.850]  I love that.
[12:46.450 --> 12:48.250]  That's that's ambitious and I love it.
[12:48.250 --> 12:49.350]  I love ambitious stories.
[12:49.350 --> 12:52.750]  I love people who face adversity and they're going to be a bad motherfucker
[12:52.750 --> 12:53.450]  because of it.
[12:53.550 --> 12:54.150]  Like I don't know.
[12:54.750 --> 12:56.350]  Yeah thriving with a struggle.
[12:56.350 --> 12:59.450]  That's awesome and bless your wife for helping you out because you're going
[12:59.450 --> 13:01.350]  to need a little bit of coaching to figure things out.
[13:01.350 --> 13:03.850]  I'm trying so I spent like a day and a half.
[13:04.250 --> 13:05.650]  You kind of spreading this one on me.
[13:05.650 --> 13:10.050]  I'm trying to wrap my head around it and that's a big.
[13:11.950 --> 13:13.150]  Question mark right now.
[13:13.150 --> 13:16.050]  Like there's all so many different things where my brain's like, well, how
[13:16.050 --> 13:17.050]  are we going to do this?
[13:18.150 --> 13:18.550]  Yeah.
[13:19.150 --> 13:25.550]  Yeah, I as he has the is a person who is often in charge of large commercial
[13:25.550 --> 13:26.450]  cultivations.
[13:26.850 --> 13:30.450]  My main job is to oversee shit.
[13:31.550 --> 13:34.350]  90% of what I'm doing is seeing what's going on.
[13:34.450 --> 13:39.150]  I just walk around and look at shit like is this room where it needs to be
[13:39.150 --> 13:39.950]  are the temperatures.
[13:39.950 --> 13:41.950]  I guess I feel that part but I look at meters.
[13:42.550 --> 13:44.250]  Do the plants look good?
[13:44.750 --> 13:46.550]  Does the equipment say what it needs to say?
[13:46.650 --> 13:49.650]  The lights doing with it and I go to another room and then I look at the
[13:49.650 --> 13:52.650]  crew are the guys doing with and the gals are they doing what they need to
[13:52.650 --> 13:55.750]  do is Mike doing what he needs to do are the computers working properly
[13:56.050 --> 13:58.050]  because you guys are running computers in part of the building are the
[13:58.050 --> 14:01.350]  tremors do I'm visually doing 90% of my job.
[14:02.750 --> 14:07.950]  So yeah, the reason I wanted to read this is because I had very minimal
[14:07.950 --> 14:09.250]  useful advice.
[14:09.450 --> 14:13.850]  I have never I don't have any experience being blind more about the the
[14:13.850 --> 14:16.250]  gross set up before I can even let's keep going.
[14:16.550 --> 14:18.950]  It says we are currently curing some lemon Jeffrey.
[14:19.350 --> 14:21.150]  I did not really participate in the grow.
[14:21.150 --> 14:23.650]  I was just a cheerleader and a smell tester.
[14:23.950 --> 14:26.750]  So it sounds like the wife is probably got a decent grasp on growing.
[14:27.150 --> 14:28.150]  Thanks for all you do.
[14:28.150 --> 14:29.150]  I hope to hear back from you.
[14:29.150 --> 14:32.050]  I understand you're a busy man and you already have a full plate.
[14:32.150 --> 14:34.350]  Thanks again and keep it up kind regards.
[14:34.550 --> 14:35.450]  They signed with their full name.
[14:35.450 --> 14:39.250]  I'm not going to say that but we're going to call them inspiring fucking
[14:39.250 --> 14:40.850]  grower will be their new name.
[14:41.750 --> 14:45.050]  So I don't have any like I said any useful advice.
[14:45.550 --> 14:48.450]  I don't I didn't ask a lot of questions about what kind of products are
[14:48.450 --> 14:52.750]  using what your setup is that that was more technical than I was even ready
[14:52.750 --> 14:53.350]  to get.
[14:53.650 --> 14:59.050]  I thought there may be other blind people other blind growers other growers
[14:59.050 --> 15:02.250]  who are losing their sight and slowly lost their sight over time that have
[15:02.250 --> 15:03.850]  learned how to adapt and adjust.
[15:04.550 --> 15:06.150]  Yeah, so I'm hoping they're listening.
[15:06.150 --> 15:07.350]  That's the other odds.
[15:07.350 --> 15:09.250]  We've got to have them listening also.
[15:09.650 --> 15:12.750]  So hopefully they're listening then also hopefully they're able to reach
[15:12.750 --> 15:14.150]  out to us and reach us.
[15:14.550 --> 15:19.250]  My email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[15:19.550 --> 15:22.950]  If you send me an email and tell me that you've got advice and ways to help
[15:22.950 --> 15:25.850]  out a blind grower or somebody who is losing their sight.
[15:25.950 --> 15:28.650]  I would love some advice to help our new friend because this is a great
[15:28.650 --> 15:32.350]  story and big props to the wife, but I understand that you want to be
[15:32.450 --> 15:33.850]  self-sufficient and do it yourself.
[15:33.850 --> 15:34.750]  That's really cool.
[15:34.850 --> 15:38.150]  And I want to see you do that, but I've never been blind.
[15:38.150 --> 15:39.950]  So I don't have any good advice for that.
[15:39.950 --> 15:43.250]  It's everything if you put if you blindfolded me and put me in the grow
[15:43.250 --> 15:44.850]  room, I would hurt myself.
[15:45.650 --> 15:49.250]  Like there's so many things in there that I'm just afraid of without
[15:49.250 --> 15:54.650]  sight and well, it's we're neither of us have had to operate without it.
[15:54.650 --> 15:57.450]  So we're both so heavily reliant on it.
[15:57.850 --> 16:04.550]  I'm just like I'm thinking about a couple of different like nutrient
[16:04.550 --> 16:09.950]  stations that we've managed and some of the different cost of cleaner
[16:09.950 --> 16:13.150]  and agents or we did talk a couple of times.
[16:13.950 --> 16:16.850]  And he said that his biggest issues are mixing and sexing.
[16:16.850 --> 16:17.250]  So you're right.
[16:17.250 --> 16:19.950]  The nutrient station, like all the bottles look the same.
[16:20.150 --> 16:22.950]  You'd have to get different shaped bottles for each nutrient.
[16:23.250 --> 16:28.550]  I was thinking about cloning and I'm like, well, you can do a lot of that
[16:28.550 --> 16:33.450]  with feel, but when you go to check the roots and you'll know this better
[16:33.450 --> 16:36.550]  than I do, so I've got the plant and a plug.
[16:37.150 --> 16:41.650]  I pull that plug out to to visually inspect if there are roots, but if I
[16:41.650 --> 16:45.350]  can't visually inspect how sensitive are those to touch.
[16:45.850 --> 16:50.250]  Personally, I never interact with them really until I go to transplant
[16:50.250 --> 16:54.650]  them and then it's only to gently set them in their cup and coat them
[16:54.650 --> 16:55.250]  with dirt.
[16:55.250 --> 17:00.250]  Can they handle, can you give them a gentle rub to feel how your roots
[17:00.250 --> 17:01.050]  are developing?
[17:01.050 --> 17:04.850]  Yeah, I think a little squeeze would be okay, but there's some situations
[17:04.850 --> 17:07.750]  that can you squeeze to tell if the buds are ripe?
[17:08.050 --> 17:08.650]  Like that's...
[17:09.450 --> 17:12.350]  No, but you can't otherwise.
[17:14.550 --> 17:15.950]  It's an eight week plant.
[17:17.050 --> 17:22.250]  You and I have both run schedules where we would prefer to check every
[17:22.250 --> 17:29.650]  plant with a scope or a loop and look for amber versus non-amber versus
[17:29.650 --> 17:33.950]  white versus cloudy, but we can't because we have to harvest this shit
[17:33.950 --> 17:37.450]  on Wednesday because the next crop goes in on Thursday morning.
[17:38.350 --> 17:41.150]  So that it can be in flower by next Monday.
[17:41.650 --> 17:44.650]  Yeah, you both know, we both know how that is.
[17:44.650 --> 17:46.650]  So yeah, so pick a nine week strain.
[17:46.650 --> 17:51.050]  Setting yourself up for success, finding a strain that you can hope will
[17:51.050 --> 17:56.050]  be relying on a timetable and there's going to be a lot of those little
[17:56.050 --> 17:59.150]  tricks that you and I just can't wrap our heads around yet because we're
[17:59.150 --> 18:01.550]  not used to thinking with that perspective.
[18:01.750 --> 18:02.250]  Exactly.
[18:02.250 --> 18:04.850]  That's why I'm reaching out and asking for our other, hopefully we've
[18:04.850 --> 18:08.050]  got a blind audience, a blind community that can help us out and give us
[18:08.350 --> 18:10.050]  some tips and tricks that they have learned.
[18:10.650 --> 18:13.850]  I look forward to hearing back from not only our new friend, the blind
[18:13.850 --> 18:17.650]  grower, the inspiring grower, but also more listeners who have got some
[18:17.650 --> 18:18.450]  ideas for us.
[18:18.650 --> 18:19.750]  I wish I had more tips.
[18:19.950 --> 18:22.650]  This is something I've never, that's like, yeah, I've never played.
[18:22.650 --> 18:27.150]  I keep hearing you say, that doesn't sound right as you go looking for
[18:27.150 --> 18:30.350]  what piece of gear isn't operating correctly because you've got that
[18:30.350 --> 18:31.550]  fucking musician's ear.
[18:32.050 --> 18:35.150]  So you're, they're so much more sensitive than mine.
[18:35.650 --> 18:39.450]  Like I'll hear if the AC is not running or some shit, but you'll catch
[18:39.450 --> 18:42.150]  all sorts of tiny little pieces of equipment that I never even hear.
[18:43.450 --> 18:46.350]  So I'm sure that's even more amplified for somebody who's relying on
[18:46.350 --> 18:48.150]  that sense more than their site.
[18:48.450 --> 18:51.250]  Could hear that fucking dehumidifier leaking all the time.
[18:51.250 --> 18:52.850]  Nobody said, nobody believed me.
[18:53.950 --> 18:54.850]  Thing was leaking, bro.
[18:54.950 --> 18:55.850]  It's filled with water.
[18:55.950 --> 19:03.650]  Yeah, I'm sure that especially with the wife to help practice stuff that
[19:03.650 --> 19:05.850]  we, we can a hundred percent figure out how to do this.
[19:06.050 --> 19:06.250]  Yeah.
[19:07.650 --> 19:08.450]  Shout out to the wife.
[19:08.550 --> 19:08.750]  All right.
[19:08.750 --> 19:11.850]  We're going to move on to a next message to the next message.
[19:12.150 --> 19:14.450]  Hopefully we can give them more solid answer to this one.
[19:14.950 --> 19:15.250]  Yes.
[19:15.750 --> 19:16.550]  I'm pretty sure we can.
[19:16.550 --> 19:17.350]  I'm good at this one.
[19:17.850 --> 19:21.350]  This one comes from, let's see, do they want their name said?
[19:21.950 --> 19:22.250]  Yeah.
[19:22.250 --> 19:23.050]  Their name is Miles.
[19:23.050 --> 19:24.050]  This one comes from Miles.
[19:24.050 --> 19:24.650]  What's up, Miles?
[19:24.650 --> 19:25.750]  Thank you for the good message.
[19:26.150 --> 19:26.950]  It says, hey bro.
[19:27.050 --> 19:27.550]  Love you.
[19:27.550 --> 19:28.250]  Love the show.
[19:28.250 --> 19:28.850]  Love you too, bro.
[19:28.850 --> 19:29.450]  Big fist bump.
[19:29.450 --> 19:30.550]  Hope you're watching on YouTube.
[19:30.950 --> 19:31.850]  My name is Miles.
[19:31.850 --> 19:33.950]  I'm a patient and caregiver and a grower.
[19:34.250 --> 19:38.350]  I'll start off by saying you have made my skills as a grower sharpen over the
[19:38.350 --> 19:39.350]  last year.
[19:39.550 --> 19:43.350]  I stumbled on onto your podcast after seeing you on the dude grow show.
[19:43.650 --> 19:45.450]  I'm glad you found us on the dude grow show.
[19:45.450 --> 19:47.050]  Big shout out to the DGC.
[19:47.250 --> 19:49.750]  And thanks for mentioning that I have made you a better grower.
[19:49.750 --> 19:52.050]  I've made your skills sharpen.
[19:52.050 --> 19:52.550]  That's awesome.
[19:52.550 --> 19:53.150]  I appreciate it.
[19:53.250 --> 19:53.850]  Sharpen.
[19:53.850 --> 19:54.350]  That's awesome.
[19:54.350 --> 19:55.150]  I appreciate that.
[19:55.550 --> 19:58.750]  Since then I haven't missed a new show and I've listened to probably 200
[19:58.750 --> 19:59.750]  podcasts.
[20:00.050 --> 20:00.650]  Oh, yeah.
[20:00.750 --> 20:02.850]  You've heard a lot of this fucking terrible voice.
[20:04.550 --> 20:04.750]  Yeah.
[20:04.750 --> 20:05.250]  Thank you, bro.
[20:05.350 --> 20:08.150]  Keep doing what you're doing for us and to hone our trying to hone our
[20:08.150 --> 20:08.650]  skills.
[20:10.150 --> 20:11.450]  Excuse me for the throat clearing you guys.
[20:11.450 --> 20:12.750]  It got Mike to the same time.
[20:13.550 --> 20:14.150]  There we go.
[20:14.250 --> 20:18.950]  I just had a question for you and it would be great for the show and Miles.
[20:18.950 --> 20:22.450]  I do apologize that it took me a minute to get to your message, but here it
[20:22.450 --> 20:23.050]  comes, buddy.
[20:23.050 --> 20:25.950]  It is time for your message on the show.
[20:25.950 --> 20:29.650]  It says my reason for writing is seed banks.
[20:29.650 --> 20:31.150]  I know you have your own seed banks.
[20:31.150 --> 20:35.450]  You work with and all like and then he put a couple he listed a few of them
[20:35.450 --> 20:37.650]  seeds here now and Dankstore are pros.
[20:37.850 --> 20:40.750]  I've recently had a rash of bad seeds.
[20:40.750 --> 20:42.650]  I've gotten them all from Europe.
[20:42.850 --> 20:44.850]  I think we all know who that is.
[20:44.950 --> 20:47.250]  And then he says and then he mentions the company.
[20:47.250 --> 20:49.250]  We know if they're coming from out of from Europe.
[20:49.250 --> 20:50.450]  We probably know who they are.
[20:50.650 --> 20:51.050]  Oops.
[20:51.350 --> 20:55.850]  And it says I've gotten from some from US breeders and then he mentions a
[20:55.850 --> 20:59.350]  couple of US breeders and I don't want to say their names because I know some
[20:59.350 --> 21:02.550]  of these people and I know that some of them offer great seeds and I know that
[21:02.550 --> 21:04.450]  some of them offer not so great seeds.
[21:04.750 --> 21:08.350]  It goes on to say what is the deal with quality control?
[21:08.650 --> 21:12.550]  Why so many bad seeds out there and what companies take care of their
[21:12.550 --> 21:13.150]  customers?
[21:13.150 --> 21:17.250]  I've gotten replacements from some but others are anything but friendly.
[21:17.850 --> 21:21.550]  He lists a company and he says this company for example told me they do not
[21:21.550 --> 21:23.050]  replace freebies.
[21:23.650 --> 21:26.250]  Let me back up and touch on a couple of things because you did ask what's the
[21:26.250 --> 21:27.550]  deal with quality control?
[21:28.850 --> 21:32.150]  It depends on like everything else bro.
[21:32.250 --> 21:33.350]  Yeah, there's no standard.
[21:33.350 --> 21:34.250]  That's part of the problem.
[21:34.250 --> 21:40.750]  There's no standard many breeders are a name on a website you click on fucking
[21:40.950 --> 21:42.550]  I don't want to single out any website.
[21:42.550 --> 21:46.650]  I'm going to make up something seeds.com you click on this website and then you
[21:46.650 --> 21:49.850]  find a breeder fucking X and you read a strand you go that sounds like awesome
[21:49.850 --> 21:50.350]  description.
[21:50.350 --> 21:51.150]  I want to buy it.
[21:51.250 --> 21:55.050]  That's your only connection between you and breeder X they can put popcorn seeds
[21:55.050 --> 21:59.950]  in that fucking container the vendors that sell it vet them good vendors vet
[21:59.950 --> 22:03.250]  their breeders and don't allow that to happen where you bought from they carry
[22:03.250 --> 22:07.050]  everybody on the planet and things I've never heard of before they they're not
[22:07.050 --> 22:09.950]  going to send you popcorn seeds, but there's no quality control on the seeds
[22:09.950 --> 22:10.750]  that go out.
[22:10.850 --> 22:15.150]  Once the I pack the seeds for I read genetics of the packs that go out in the
[22:15.250 --> 22:19.650]  some breeders hire other people to pack the seeds and it's up to that person to
[22:19.650 --> 22:23.350]  select a grade seeds and not give you B or C grade seeds.
[22:23.350 --> 22:26.450]  So that's part of the process who packed him was at the owner of the company was
[22:26.450 --> 22:30.350]  it one of his flunkies was it his wife was it somebody that knows is it was
[22:30.350 --> 22:34.950]  somebody that cares so it's all about did they pick fucking quality seeds.
[22:34.950 --> 22:36.350]  There is no quality control.
[22:36.350 --> 22:40.450]  It's all about each company's own quality control the quality control comes
[22:40.450 --> 22:43.750]  on the consumer end on things like you're going to go to the internet and you're
[22:43.750 --> 22:47.150]  going to say you're going to say all of the names I blanked out on this you're
[22:47.150 --> 22:50.450]  going to say all that shit on the internet on the correct forms in the appropriate
[22:50.450 --> 22:50.950]  places.
[22:51.150 --> 22:53.550]  That's how quality control happens in the seed industry.
[22:53.650 --> 22:59.650]  Unfortunately, so quality control why so many bad seeds out there because people
[22:59.650 --> 23:02.150]  can sell you seeds and never have to face you again.
[23:02.250 --> 23:03.350]  I put my face out here.
[23:03.350 --> 23:04.550]  I am I read genetics.
[23:04.550 --> 23:08.150]  I represent my company if you come to our booth at an event, it's going to be
[23:08.150 --> 23:11.950]  probably myself Mike and one or two other people helping us out, but it's always
[23:11.950 --> 23:15.950]  going to be me unless I'm talking or doing something but I'm at the booth.
[23:15.950 --> 23:16.650]  That's my job.
[23:16.650 --> 23:17.650]  I'm supposed to be there.
[23:17.850 --> 23:19.050]  They want to come talk to me.
[23:19.050 --> 23:21.050]  You're going to see me if you've got a problem with my seeds.
[23:21.050 --> 23:22.950]  You can politely say hey add an issue.
[23:22.950 --> 23:23.650]  Let's talk about it.
[23:23.650 --> 23:24.650]  We'll sit down and talk about it.
[23:24.650 --> 23:28.250]  You'll probably get a replacement if you got a real story Michael probably be
[23:28.250 --> 23:28.850]  there too.
[23:28.950 --> 23:33.350]  We put our faces out there so many people don't and if you don't have to put your
[23:33.350 --> 23:37.350]  face out there who knows what bad motherfucker and there may be a seed company
[23:37.350 --> 23:41.450]  called bad motherfucker seeds at this point, but whatever it's just an ad in the
[23:41.450 --> 23:45.750]  paper as far as yeah, it's a clicky thing on the internet and you don't know who
[23:45.750 --> 23:49.450]  you're interacting with or who you're talking to and so that's why people are
[23:49.450 --> 23:50.550]  able to get away with it.
[23:51.050 --> 23:52.250]  So that's the deal with quality control.
[23:52.250 --> 23:57.150]  That's why so many bad seeds what companies take care of their customers.
[23:57.150 --> 24:00.650]  I know that and this is not advertising or a sales pitch.
[24:00.650 --> 24:06.250]  I know that everybody at seeds here now.com has been personally selected by
[24:06.250 --> 24:10.550]  James Bean James Bean knows the maker of all of the seeds on that website.
[24:10.750 --> 24:11.750]  You have to shake his hand.
[24:11.750 --> 24:12.950]  You have to have a meeting with him.
[24:12.950 --> 24:13.950]  You have to hang out with them.
[24:15.050 --> 24:19.050]  He's a lot like me you could make him a lot of money, but if he doesn't like you
[24:19.050 --> 24:20.750]  he will not put you on his website.
[24:20.850 --> 24:24.150]  That's simply how he works like no, I don't like your business that business
[24:24.150 --> 24:26.950]  ethics something about you makes me kind of uneasy.
[24:27.150 --> 24:29.150]  I don't need to do business with you and he'll pass on you.
[24:29.350 --> 24:33.950]  So you got to be a good breeder to get on seeds here now.com after that everything
[24:33.950 --> 24:36.950]  on the website is backed by a satisfaction guarantee.
[24:37.150 --> 24:40.650]  If you've got a problem you contact seeds here now.com and let them know what
[24:40.650 --> 24:41.350]  went wrong.
[24:41.450 --> 24:44.850]  Most of the time you will get a replacement pack of seeds if seeds are
[24:44.850 --> 24:47.550]  now.com does not replace an iree genetics pack.
[24:47.550 --> 24:51.850]  I will that's part of what my fucking quality control customer services.
[24:51.850 --> 24:54.950]  If you've got a problem with the pack of seeds, I can afford to lose it more
[24:54.950 --> 24:57.650]  than you can I'd much rather replace it and make you happy.
[24:58.150 --> 25:01.950]  I'd rather eat a pack of seeds than eat a customer eat my reputation.
[25:02.050 --> 25:05.150]  It's that easy for me and I know the next pack will be good because there's
[25:05.150 --> 25:06.450]  not going to be too bad packs on road.
[25:06.450 --> 25:07.450]  That's very unlikely.
[25:07.850 --> 25:11.650]  So I don't know who takes care of their company their service other customers
[25:11.850 --> 25:13.450]  on a seed breeder level.
[25:13.450 --> 25:17.950]  I know that the vendors that seeds here now.com has top shelf customer service.
[25:18.250 --> 25:19.650]  I can highly recommend them.
[25:20.750 --> 25:21.150]  Let's see.
[25:21.150 --> 25:24.550]  Where are we gotten replacements from some but summer anything but friendly.
[25:25.150 --> 25:26.850]  Yeah, keep in mind though.
[25:27.850 --> 25:31.050]  A lot of people will just send breeders an email saying hey, I bought a pack of
[25:31.050 --> 25:31.350]  seeds.
[25:31.350 --> 25:34.950]  They didn't germinate gimme replacements and you can tell by the wording of the
[25:34.950 --> 25:38.750]  message if they're scamming you or if it's real 90% of the time I can tell by
[25:38.750 --> 25:39.250]  the words.
[25:40.150 --> 25:44.850]  So they're dealing with a lot of that then one company said they don't replace
[25:44.850 --> 25:45.850]  freebies.
[25:46.950 --> 25:47.850]  They were freebies.
[25:47.850 --> 25:48.550]  I don't know.
[25:48.550 --> 25:50.250]  I don't know how to feel about that.
[25:50.750 --> 25:51.250]  I don't know.
[25:52.250 --> 25:54.150]  Paid money to be eligible for that seed.
[25:54.150 --> 25:56.250]  Oh, yeah, because you got to buy so many to get the freebie.
[25:56.250 --> 25:59.050]  So it was like a bait and switch and then you got to so yeah, they should
[25:59.050 --> 26:00.250]  replace that shit for you.
[26:00.350 --> 26:04.350]  And if it's bunk wouldn't you stand behind your product?
[26:04.350 --> 26:05.650]  Yeah, I stand behind my shit.
[26:05.650 --> 26:08.050]  So what is one seed cost?
[26:09.450 --> 26:12.550]  Um, yeah that varies wildly.
[26:12.550 --> 26:14.150]  What how big is your production facility?
[26:14.150 --> 26:15.250]  How many people work for you?
[26:15.250 --> 26:18.250]  And I know I'm giving vague fucking politician answers right now.
[26:18.550 --> 26:23.850]  Um seeds are not expensive you guys like on a wholesale level at the level that
[26:23.850 --> 26:26.650]  the vendors are buying seeds seeds are not expensive.
[26:26.950 --> 26:28.150]  It's the I don't know.
[26:28.150 --> 26:30.050]  I don't want to disclose too many like I don't know.
[26:30.050 --> 26:34.150]  I may have signed a paper saying I won't tell that part with a lot of stuff.
[26:34.150 --> 26:38.950]  You're not necessarily paying for like the pro can come over and fix what's
[26:38.950 --> 26:42.350]  wrong in 30 minutes, but like you're not paying him for the 30 minutes.
[26:42.350 --> 26:43.650]  You're paying him for the 15 years.
[26:43.650 --> 26:45.750]  It took him to learn how to do it 30 minutes, right?
[26:45.950 --> 26:49.950]  It was the same thing with breeding like you're not paying for the cost to
[26:49.950 --> 26:55.950]  produce a single seed you're paying for the time, the time it takes to produce
[26:55.950 --> 27:01.450]  the time thought energy effort work dedication love that it took to breed
[27:01.450 --> 27:07.150]  both those parents then cross them then test them then retest them then
[27:07.150 --> 27:13.550]  stabilize them then market them packaging artwork in their lab testing
[27:13.550 --> 27:17.150]  each individual seed is no it's not super pricey to produce.
[27:19.550 --> 27:22.050]  People fuck up and produce seeds for free all the time.
[27:22.650 --> 27:25.550]  Yeah, but those seeds nobody knows what they are.
[27:25.550 --> 27:26.750]  Nobody knows who they came from.
[27:26.750 --> 27:30.050]  So those seeds were they're not worth anything, but I think we got to
[27:30.050 --> 27:34.250]  attract some ones that didn't germ like it's all perspective.
[27:35.150 --> 27:38.150]  So then he wraps it up with so I thought who would be the best to ask about
[27:38.150 --> 27:39.850]  this stuff and Rasta Jeff.
[27:39.950 --> 27:45.250]  Anyway, I hope all is good in your life and keep growing G my friend miles.
[27:45.250 --> 27:50.050]  I hope I answered your question customer service is all based on the breeder.
[27:50.050 --> 27:52.750]  It's all about what the breeder believes is quality.
[27:52.950 --> 27:55.850]  I think everything should come in a pretty well labeled package.
[27:55.850 --> 27:57.450]  I don't like too much handwritten shit.
[27:57.450 --> 28:00.450]  If you get a package for me directly and it's handwritten it's because I
[28:00.650 --> 28:03.350]  actually had to package that pack of seeds up for you and I didn't have a
[28:03.350 --> 28:06.650]  whole sheet of labels made and I just hand wrote it for you, but it always
[28:06.650 --> 28:07.750]  comes on the folded card.
[28:07.750 --> 28:08.250]  It looks real good.
[28:08.250 --> 28:11.650]  I try to keep them super professional like good quality packaging.
[28:11.750 --> 28:15.750]  Just make it look professional make it look sharp stuff like that good seeds
[28:15.750 --> 28:15.950]  in there.
[28:15.950 --> 28:18.950]  I try not to put shitty seeds in the packages if I wouldn't plant that if
[28:18.950 --> 28:22.050]  I wouldn't be excited to open that if I bought it like I don't put it in
[28:22.050 --> 28:22.750]  a package.
[28:22.950 --> 28:23.550]  I keep in mind.
[28:23.550 --> 28:28.350]  I know that people money is expensive people fucking work their time their
[28:28.350 --> 28:29.250]  energy their effort.
[28:29.250 --> 28:30.650]  They're away from their fucking people.
[28:30.650 --> 28:31.850]  They're away from their family.
[28:32.050 --> 28:33.650]  They're away from the air conditioner, bro.
[28:33.950 --> 28:35.050]  It's so hot right now.
[28:35.250 --> 28:38.250]  They're away from the air conditioner for eight hours 10 hours at a time
[28:38.250 --> 28:38.750]  doing shit.
[28:38.750 --> 28:42.750]  That sucks listening to some asshole yell at them about shit that they're
[28:42.750 --> 28:43.250]  doing wrong.
[28:43.250 --> 28:44.750]  That is really not even their fault.
[28:44.850 --> 28:48.150]  I get it and they're giving me that money that they made for a product.
[28:48.150 --> 28:48.950]  I understand.
[28:49.450 --> 28:50.650]  I don't want them to think fuck.
[28:50.650 --> 28:52.250]  I busted my ass and got shit out of this.
[28:52.250 --> 28:55.450]  I want them to think yeah, but I spent my money on his fucking doing it for
[28:55.450 --> 28:57.050]  me that always makes you feel good.
[28:57.750 --> 29:00.950]  So that's my quality customer control approach.
[29:00.950 --> 29:03.050]  I want people to be happy a lot of times.
[29:03.050 --> 29:04.850]  There's six seeds in a five-pack.
[29:04.850 --> 29:06.250]  That's not rare when it comes to me.
[29:06.450 --> 29:08.750]  So Miles, thank you for the great message, dude.
[29:09.150 --> 29:11.750]  If you've got any questions, send me a message.
[29:11.750 --> 29:15.750]  I'd love to hear from you grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[29:16.450 --> 29:17.650]  Mike you ready to keep moving?
[29:18.150 --> 29:20.150]  We certainly should not rat out rat out.
[29:20.150 --> 29:20.650]  Right?
[29:21.650 --> 29:22.850]  This one.
[29:22.850 --> 29:23.450]  Where are we?
[29:23.450 --> 29:25.050]  It says hey Rasta Jeff.
[29:25.050 --> 29:26.450]  It's me again.
[29:26.750 --> 29:31.350]  So apparently this person this person I feel like I may have read this message
[29:31.350 --> 29:35.150]  on the show before I'm not sure if I read it enough times.
[29:35.950 --> 29:36.150]  Yeah.
[29:36.150 --> 29:36.350]  Yeah.
[29:36.350 --> 29:39.350]  Well, it seemed familiar now that I'm reading this but it says I'll try to
[29:39.350 --> 29:40.450]  make it short fair warning.
[29:40.450 --> 29:42.950]  It won't be when I was a teenager in the mid 80s.
[29:42.950 --> 29:45.550]  I was schooled by three old hippie Vietnam vets.
[29:45.750 --> 29:47.950]  They used to use they used to pirate grow.
[29:47.950 --> 29:50.050]  Sorry for that in the National Forest.
[29:50.250 --> 29:51.150]  Shame on you guys.
[29:51.650 --> 29:53.350]  I was the gopher for two seasons.
[29:53.350 --> 29:57.950]  Anyway, they had an Afghan they ran exclusively in mile-long rows on
[29:57.950 --> 30:00.150]  south-southwest facing slopes.
[30:00.150 --> 30:01.950]  It sounds like a great fucking grow so far.
[30:02.250 --> 30:06.250]  We would so in a single row of 100 or so plants.
[30:06.250 --> 30:09.350]  All right, I can visualize this when they started showing sex.
[30:09.350 --> 30:14.150]  We would call every male except the best-looking male and give him only
[30:14.150 --> 30:16.250]  a day to start spewing.
[30:16.350 --> 30:20.350]  Anyway, it would pollinate enough to ensure enough seeds for the next
[30:20.350 --> 30:22.050]  season that sounds about right.
[30:22.350 --> 30:25.850]  So I was gifted a coffee can full of seeds.
[30:27.150 --> 30:27.850]  Yeah, right.
[30:28.050 --> 30:28.650]  That was there.
[30:28.650 --> 30:31.250]  That was 10 years into their business.
[30:31.550 --> 30:34.450]  So I think that's an s-10.
[30:35.750 --> 30:39.650]  No, not it says I think that's an s-10 which has been selfed for 10
[30:39.650 --> 30:40.550]  generations.
[30:41.250 --> 30:43.350]  No, I want to jump in right there before I lose my train of thought.
[30:43.350 --> 30:44.550]  It is not an s-10.
[30:44.550 --> 30:45.750]  It was not selfed.
[30:45.950 --> 30:49.350]  It is an f-10 open pollination.
[30:51.450 --> 30:55.450]  So f is for filial generation self would be if we reversed one of the
[30:55.450 --> 30:55.850]  plants.
[30:55.850 --> 30:59.450]  You've got a male so that is not a selfing that is an f you're going.
[30:59.750 --> 31:01.950]  Yeah, you're going further with a filial generation.
[31:01.950 --> 31:06.050]  So what happened was and who knows what f generation what filial generation
[31:06.050 --> 31:08.650]  they started with so they had a handful of seeds.
[31:08.650 --> 31:11.950]  This is presumably because you said every year they planted a hundred
[31:11.950 --> 31:12.450]  seeds.
[31:13.450 --> 31:16.650]  Did the hundred so it probably from years before so you've got a hundred
[31:16.650 --> 31:16.950]  seeds.
[31:16.950 --> 31:17.750]  They planted them.
[31:18.650 --> 31:19.450]  They picked a male.
[31:19.950 --> 31:24.150]  So they took one male and open pollinated up to 99 other plants and
[31:24.150 --> 31:25.250]  gathered the seeds from there.
[31:25.550 --> 31:30.050]  That's an open pollination because who knows which female those came from.
[31:30.050 --> 31:33.450]  It's the same plants, but it's an open pollination.
[31:33.450 --> 31:36.450]  It's the same genetics, but that way you get a lot of diversity.
[31:36.450 --> 31:41.150]  You see a lot of great phenotypes that male has now hit every female phenotype
[31:41.150 --> 31:41.350]  in there.
[31:41.350 --> 31:46.150]  They're probably somewhere between 412 16, maybe 32 different phenotypes
[31:46.150 --> 31:49.950]  available in that female just because of genetics and that male could
[31:49.950 --> 31:53.650]  possibly pollinate all of those and then we get to see what that male does
[31:53.650 --> 31:55.950]  to all of those females for the next generation.
[31:55.950 --> 32:00.550]  So he did that 10 times the first time it happened the first ones you
[32:00.550 --> 32:04.650]  planted that was f1 then you took those seeds planted a hundred cold all
[32:04.650 --> 32:05.050]  the males.
[32:05.050 --> 32:08.250]  You got one boy probably are we going to say there were 50 girls because
[32:08.250 --> 32:13.050]  they probably cold 50 males 49 males kept one male got 50 girls left just
[32:13.050 --> 32:14.750]  because of the math and numbers there.
[32:14.750 --> 32:19.550]  So that one male pollinated 50 girls and now you did an f2 open pollination
[32:19.550 --> 32:21.850]  and you just repeated that f3 open pollination.
[32:21.850 --> 32:24.550]  It was not self because there was no selfing.
[32:24.550 --> 32:25.450]  There was no reversal.
[32:25.450 --> 32:28.150]  There was an actual male used in pollination.
[32:28.150 --> 32:32.450]  So it was a filial generation moving forward in an open pollination style
[32:32.450 --> 32:35.950]  because you've got multiple females, which is a really good way to find
[32:35.950 --> 32:37.050]  genetic diversity.
[32:37.550 --> 32:40.150]  Alright, so that catches us up a little bit right there.
[32:40.150 --> 32:42.050]  Where are we going to go from there?
[32:42.050 --> 32:48.850]  I grew them for personal reasons only until my divorce in 2010 and then my
[32:48.850 --> 32:50.650]  genetics were mysteriously lost.
[32:50.650 --> 32:53.750]  Imagine that I Scottie would say hmm.
[32:53.750 --> 32:54.550]  That's fucking funny.
[32:54.550 --> 32:55.950]  We got a DGC listener here.
[32:55.950 --> 32:59.650]  Then it goes on to say anyway, my point is I want to find something as
[32:59.650 --> 33:00.850]  close to that as I can.
[33:00.850 --> 33:02.750]  Do you have any suggestions or ideas?
[33:02.750 --> 33:06.450]  I was completely out of the game for 13 years and damn it's a different
[33:06.450 --> 33:06.950]  world now.
[33:06.950 --> 33:10.150]  I feel like Rip Van Winkle sometimes.
[33:10.150 --> 33:14.850]  I am forever grateful for you from apical marist stem also known as they
[33:14.850 --> 33:15.450]  put the real name.
[33:15.450 --> 33:18.350]  I'm not going to read that out loud but big shout to our friend apical
[33:18.350 --> 33:20.150]  atypical Marist M.
[33:20.150 --> 33:21.550]  Sorry, I read that wrong the first time.
[33:21.550 --> 33:27.550]  The last part of that question there looking for genetics like with these
[33:27.550 --> 33:31.550]  old hippies used to grow that Afghan man.
[33:31.550 --> 33:33.750]  I would recommend look for some pure Afghan seeds.
[33:33.850 --> 33:35.350]  Probably find some pure Afi.
[33:35.350 --> 33:40.150]  Yes, and pure Afi some la og Afi something like that.
[33:40.150 --> 33:44.050]  I think DNA genetics may be a good start.
[33:44.050 --> 33:48.050]  They are harder to get into the States than a lot of other brands but some
[33:48.050 --> 33:52.450]  of that la kush og kush la og Afi.
[33:52.450 --> 33:53.950]  That's the stuff you're going to be looking for.
[33:53.950 --> 33:57.850]  I don't know if it's going to be anything like what you were smoking
[33:57.850 --> 34:01.550]  13 years ago, bro, but keep chasing that dragon.
[34:01.650 --> 34:03.350]  That's like the growers fucking thing.
[34:03.350 --> 34:05.450]  Now one thing we smoked that one time.
[34:05.450 --> 34:10.650]  I've been looking for that p91 for so long, but I think I think she's here.
[34:10.650 --> 34:11.250]  We'll see.
[34:11.250 --> 34:12.250]  We'll see.
[34:12.250 --> 34:16.650]  Yeah, it's everybody's got that one in their head that they're still looking
[34:16.650 --> 34:17.850]  for still chasing.
[34:17.850 --> 34:22.250]  I think I got my dude and I'm excited but I'm I'm always skeptical until I
[34:22.250 --> 34:24.750]  flower it but it looks right to see it in flower.
[34:24.750 --> 34:27.650]  It looks right and I wouldn't know if it's flowered right or not because I
[34:27.650 --> 34:28.450]  never saw the plant.
[34:28.450 --> 34:30.850]  I only got the buds delivered in ounce and pound packages.
[34:30.950 --> 34:33.750]  So I don't know what the plant the fucking flowers and the plants even
[34:33.750 --> 34:35.350]  look like right?
[34:36.850 --> 34:39.450]  Yeah, the the old school stuff.
[34:39.450 --> 34:44.250]  I think unfortunately a lot of it's been lost the time everything's been
[34:44.250 --> 34:50.650]  crossbred but you never know because everything's still half or more
[34:50.650 --> 34:51.550]  underground.
[34:52.450 --> 34:57.250]  There are who's got what seeds in their sock drawer and luckily some of the
[34:57.350 --> 35:01.550]  later States to come into legalization and activism.
[35:01.550 --> 35:02.550]  They're still way behind.
[35:02.550 --> 35:04.450]  So some of those old genetics are still there.
[35:04.450 --> 35:06.450]  They've still got some of that old shit.
[35:06.450 --> 35:07.750]  So maybe somebody's got it.
[35:07.750 --> 35:13.350]  Maybe some old war vets got some shit from Afghan that you know, like put
[35:13.350 --> 35:16.150]  it out into the universe that you're looking for this old Afghan do some
[35:16.150 --> 35:18.450]  research on the internet put it out there.
[35:18.450 --> 35:19.850]  It will come to you my friend.
[35:19.850 --> 35:20.450]  It will come to you.
[35:20.450 --> 35:22.850]  That's how that's how these things work.
[35:22.850 --> 35:24.950]  I've been looking for this one strain for years.
[35:24.950 --> 35:27.450]  I said something in the right chat room and someone's like I've got that
[35:27.450 --> 35:28.150]  I'm sitting on it.
[35:28.150 --> 35:31.950]  You want one of them here and I was like, oh what so that's how I ended up
[35:31.950 --> 35:37.350]  with one of the strain that I've been looking for for since 2002 2001 ish.
[35:37.350 --> 35:38.650]  I've been trying to find a clone of this.
[35:39.950 --> 35:40.650]  I've got it now.
[35:41.450 --> 35:45.050]  Yeah, so be patient when the time is right that motherfucker may just
[35:45.050 --> 35:46.450]  fucking land right in your lap.
[35:47.950 --> 35:48.850]  Or in your mailbox.
[35:50.650 --> 35:52.350]  It's a strange time to be alive.
[35:52.350 --> 35:53.350]  I fucking love it.
[35:53.450 --> 35:54.950]  It's a beautiful time to be alive bro.
[35:54.950 --> 35:56.050]  It is a beautiful time.
[35:56.450 --> 35:58.950]  Those were the only emails that I had selected for this show.
[35:58.950 --> 36:01.350]  I feel like we burned right through them quite quickly today.
[36:01.450 --> 36:01.750]  Mike.
[36:01.750 --> 36:03.950]  I had a good fucking time hanging out with you.
[36:04.450 --> 36:07.550]  Oh, yeah, we we put these off for a minute.
[36:07.550 --> 36:08.850]  We got through some stuff.
[36:09.950 --> 36:12.250]  I'm actually glad I stepped back because holy fuck.
[36:12.250 --> 36:14.350]  Did you step up the level of content buddy?
[36:14.950 --> 36:17.350]  That's a couple shows have been stellar.
[36:17.550 --> 36:18.050]  Thank you, bro.
[36:18.050 --> 36:18.750]  I appreciate that.
[36:18.750 --> 36:21.950]  I hope everybody else enjoyed the shows to the feminized seed got a lot of
[36:21.950 --> 36:25.350]  notice the mail plant selection got a lot of notice and the ones in between.
[36:25.850 --> 36:26.650]  So thank you guys.
[36:26.650 --> 36:31.550]  Those were amazing in I laughed really hard at the air conditioning episode
[36:31.550 --> 36:33.350]  because I've been dealing with that stuff too.
[36:33.350 --> 36:37.550]  I think we're all kind of everybody's heads in the same place like fuck.
[36:37.550 --> 36:38.250]  It's hot right now.
[36:38.250 --> 36:41.950]  How do I get half of half of my social media thinks I'm psychic like that's
[36:41.950 --> 36:45.950]  what I was thinking about and I was like, but every email I get is it's too
[36:45.950 --> 36:46.750]  hot help.
[36:47.750 --> 36:52.650]  I was starting to scout out a place at the new house where I could put a tent
[36:53.250 --> 36:56.150]  and immediately as soon as it got hot this summer.
[36:56.150 --> 36:57.850]  It was one of the things I was waiting on.
[36:57.850 --> 37:01.950]  I wanted to see what the airflow in this house does in the summer and already
[37:01.950 --> 37:06.150]  I'm like, nope, not growing in this room needs modification.
[37:06.250 --> 37:06.550]  Yeah.
[37:06.550 --> 37:08.250]  Yeah, you notice quickly when the heat comes.
[37:08.550 --> 37:08.850]  Yep.
[37:09.150 --> 37:09.550]  Yeah.
[37:09.650 --> 37:10.150]  Yeah.
[37:11.350 --> 37:13.250]  Yeah, they're running as many lights this summer.
[37:13.350 --> 37:14.450]  Holy shit, dude.
[37:15.050 --> 37:17.550]  No, I it in fact is in everything.
[37:17.550 --> 37:21.650]  I remember arguing with owners because I couldn't get them to understand that
[37:21.650 --> 37:26.350]  trimmers can't work in a hundred degree building for in be the same level of
[37:26.350 --> 37:28.650]  productive as they are in a 75 degree space.
[37:28.650 --> 37:31.750]  It's just the heat will fuck you quick.
[37:31.750 --> 37:32.050]  Yeah.
[37:32.150 --> 37:37.750]  Yeah, and that we're talking about local weather shit now, but we are in the
[37:37.750 --> 37:42.150]  high desert mid desert area and where we were the wind would come by and you
[37:42.150 --> 37:46.950]  could feel the water just leave your body like this dry hot wind would come
[37:46.950 --> 37:49.450]  by and he'd like, huh, it just took my moisture.
[37:49.450 --> 37:50.250]  Oh shit.
[37:50.450 --> 37:52.650]  Like all the water would just go out of your whole body.
[37:52.650 --> 37:55.050]  You need a gallon of water to replace it immediately.
[37:55.550 --> 38:00.150]  Well, it's I mean, it's not just we got high and sort of talking about local
[38:00.150 --> 38:00.550]  weather.
[38:00.550 --> 38:03.350]  It's just this is what the cannabis world is dealing with right now.
