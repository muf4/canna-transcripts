[00:13.500 --> 00:14.940]  All right, here we go.
[00:14.940 --> 00:16.740]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:16.740 --> 00:19.020]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DeGeff.
[00:19.020 --> 00:23.980]  This is episode 748 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.980 --> 00:25.440]  In this episode, I'm going to focus
[00:25.440 --> 00:27.220]  on a couple of listener emails
[00:27.220 --> 00:29.040]  before I get to that part of the show.
[00:29.040 --> 00:31.580]  Let's do a few shout outs to a few of the kind of folks
[00:31.580 --> 00:34.960]  who continue to support the show on Patreon.

[01:36.100 --> 01:39.700]  for all of my friends to support the podcast.
[01:40.340 --> 01:41.420]  All right, before I jump into the main topic
[01:41.420 --> 01:42.820]  of today's podcast,
[01:42.820 --> 01:44.500]  I do want to talk about something I saw today.
[01:44.500 --> 01:47.540]  I was driving around town and I saw a giant fire.
[01:47.540 --> 01:50.180]  There was a huge fire and it made me want to come home
[01:50.180 --> 01:52.700]  and remind you if you're growing,
[01:52.700 --> 01:55.200]  maybe if you're not growing, maybe just in your home,
[01:55.200 --> 01:56.460]  definitely if you're growing,
[01:56.460 --> 02:00.300]  do you have a smoke detector, some sort of fire detector?
[02:00.300 --> 02:03.900]  Then if that goes off, do you have a fire extinguisher?
[02:03.900 --> 02:07.440]  Sometimes a lot of us may be running a lot of equipment.
[02:07.440 --> 02:10.240]  Just plugging in a grow light could set you up for disaster
[02:10.240 --> 02:12.240]  if you're pulling too much power from the wall
[02:12.240 --> 02:14.840]  or if that grow light maybe, what's the word?
[02:14.840 --> 02:16.560]  If it malfunctions, if it's faulty
[02:16.560 --> 02:17.920]  is the word I'm looking for,
[02:17.920 --> 02:20.280]  that grow light can definitely cause major problems.
[02:20.280 --> 02:23.280]  It can cause an electrical fire, it could cause a fire.
[02:23.280 --> 02:25.880]  We need to make sure as growers
[02:25.880 --> 02:28.460]  that we don't put that mark on our community.
[02:28.460 --> 02:31.600]  We've come a long way in cannabis legalization
[02:31.600 --> 02:33.660]  and cannabis acceptance.
[02:33.660 --> 02:35.440]  We are not, it's not crack anymore.
[02:35.440 --> 02:37.380]  We are not treated like the devil anymore.
[02:38.220 --> 02:39.060]  We're given a lot of privileges.
[02:39.060 --> 02:41.740]  Now it is our responsibilities to make sure,
[02:41.740 --> 02:44.100]  excuse me, it's our responsibility to make sure
[02:44.100 --> 02:45.860]  that we do not burn anything down.
[02:45.860 --> 02:47.940]  We've been given the rights to grow in our homes.
[02:47.940 --> 02:49.500]  Many of us are growing legally.
[02:49.500 --> 02:51.420]  A lot of you may be growing illegally.
[02:51.420 --> 02:54.320]  We need to be very careful to not have a fire.
[02:54.320 --> 02:55.280]  Let's avoid a fire.
[02:55.280 --> 02:56.660]  Let's be logical and think about it
[02:56.660 --> 02:58.580]  when we're setting up the grow.
[02:58.580 --> 03:00.740]  One thing that often causes a fire
[03:00.740 --> 03:03.120]  is people trying to pull too much electricity
[03:03.120 --> 03:06.240]  from one breaker or maybe even one breaker box.
[03:06.240 --> 03:08.240]  Think about all of the power you're pulling.
[03:08.240 --> 03:09.840]  If you're running too many extension cords,
[03:09.840 --> 03:11.320]  if you've got a weak wiring,
[03:11.320 --> 03:13.020]  that could definitely cause a fire.
[03:13.020 --> 03:13.860]  Think about that.
[03:13.860 --> 03:15.400]  Don't ever overload an amp.
[03:15.400 --> 03:17.860]  Don't overload a breaker is what I'm trying to say
[03:17.860 --> 03:19.040]  with too many amps.
[03:19.040 --> 03:20.440]  Don't keep flipping that breaker.
[03:20.440 --> 03:22.480]  If it flips a couple of times, you've got a problem.
[03:22.480 --> 03:24.060]  You need to make some adjustments.
[03:24.060 --> 03:24.900]  Don't be that guy.
[03:24.900 --> 03:25.740]  Don't be that gal.
[03:25.740 --> 03:27.960]  Don't be that grower that burnt down the house,
[03:27.960 --> 03:29.980]  caused a huge fire on the entire block.
[03:29.980 --> 03:32.120]  The fire I saw today, it was hours ago.
[03:32.120 --> 03:33.080]  It's probably still burning.
[03:33.080 --> 03:35.280]  It's gonna take a minute to get that bad motherfucker out,
[03:35.280 --> 03:36.640]  but that fire was raging.
[03:36.640 --> 03:38.040]  Let's not cause the fires.
[03:38.040 --> 03:41.160]  Now, what I wanted to focus on is, are you ready?
[03:41.160 --> 03:44.000]  If there, I don't want you to have a fire, but you might.
[03:44.000 --> 03:44.820]  It could happen.
[03:44.820 --> 03:45.840]  Are you prepared?
[03:45.840 --> 03:46.880]  Do you have a strategy?
[03:46.880 --> 03:48.000]  Do you have a smoke detector?
[03:48.000 --> 03:49.600]  Something that's going to indicate to you,
[03:49.600 --> 03:51.240]  hey, there is smoke.
[03:51.240 --> 03:52.840]  You need to do some shit.
[03:52.840 --> 03:54.600]  Do you have a smoke detector in your house
[03:54.600 --> 03:56.040]  that will beep and let you know?
[03:56.040 --> 03:59.200]  Do you have something connected to a device in your grow
[03:59.200 --> 04:00.640]  that will let you know on your phone?
[04:00.640 --> 04:01.520]  Will it notify you?
[04:01.520 --> 04:02.520]  Will it beep?
[04:02.520 --> 04:04.420]  Maybe you've got a heat sensor in there
[04:04.420 --> 04:06.100]  that will let you know, hey, it's way hot in here.
[04:06.100 --> 04:07.340]  It'll let you, it'll beep and let you know
[04:07.340 --> 04:08.420]  there's a fire in the grow room.
[04:08.420 --> 04:10.140]  You can see something's going on.
[04:10.140 --> 04:12.860]  Do you have some sort of notification?
[04:12.860 --> 04:16.500]  Something to think about with that notification of a fire.
[04:16.500 --> 04:18.220]  If you're growing in an illegal area,
[04:18.220 --> 04:20.500]  do you really want the cops and the fire department
[04:20.500 --> 04:21.340]  coming to your grow?
[04:21.340 --> 04:24.020]  You may need a strategy for getting out that fire.
[04:24.020 --> 04:27.580]  So I highly recommend, I recommend this for any home.
[04:27.580 --> 04:29.480]  If you've got a house where there are people,
[04:29.480 --> 04:31.420]  if you're cooking, if you've got electricity,
[04:31.420 --> 04:32.700]  go get a fire extinguisher,
[04:32.700 --> 04:35.460]  a small fire extinguisher from a local hardware store.
[04:35.460 --> 04:36.740]  I hope you don't have to use it,
[04:36.740 --> 04:39.260]  but I would rather you have that fire extinguisher
[04:39.260 --> 04:41.440]  sitting on the shelf, sitting on the cupboard,
[04:41.440 --> 04:42.540]  sitting on the counter.
[04:42.540 --> 04:43.900]  It only takes up a little bit of space.
[04:43.900 --> 04:44.880]  Put it on top of the fridge,
[04:44.880 --> 04:46.460]  make sure everybody knows it's there.
[04:46.460 --> 04:48.500]  But I'd rather you have that and not need it
[04:48.500 --> 04:50.260]  than need it and not have it.
[04:50.260 --> 04:53.260]  That couple of bucks that you spend could save your life,
[04:53.260 --> 04:54.340]  your home, your family.
[04:54.340 --> 04:55.700]  It could save all your stuff.
[04:55.700 --> 04:58.220]  It's probably gonna ruin your crop and your garden,
[04:58.220 --> 05:00.420]  but I'd rather spray down the entire grow space
[05:00.420 --> 05:03.140]  with some of that disgusting fire extinguisher shit
[05:03.140 --> 05:05.980]  than burn down the entire building structure facility
[05:05.980 --> 05:07.180]  that the grow is in.
[05:07.180 --> 05:08.540]  That would make a big difference to me.
[05:08.540 --> 05:11.120]  So do you have some sort of warning?
[05:11.120 --> 05:11.960]  First of all, I guess,
[05:11.960 --> 05:14.680]  make sure you're not overloading any breakers, any circuits.
[05:14.680 --> 05:16.340]  Is all of your stuff safe?
[05:16.340 --> 05:17.540]  Is all of your stuff current?
[05:17.540 --> 05:18.740]  Do you have a bunch of old ballast
[05:18.740 --> 05:21.100]  that make a bunch of weird noises when you turn them on?
[05:21.100 --> 05:22.540]  Does it go, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow?
[05:22.540 --> 05:24.060]  Does it sound like it's gonna catch on fire?
[05:24.060 --> 05:25.000]  Guess what?
[05:25.000 --> 05:25.840]  It's gonna.
[05:25.840 --> 05:27.700]  Are all of your blowers connected properly?
[05:27.700 --> 05:29.780]  Is there anything in any of the fans
[05:29.780 --> 05:31.360]  or is all the wiring good?
[05:31.360 --> 05:34.660]  I know a lot of people do some real ingenuitive wiring
[05:34.660 --> 05:35.780]  to make shit work.
[05:35.780 --> 05:36.940]  Be very careful.
[05:36.940 --> 05:38.220]  Let's not burn anything down.
[05:38.220 --> 05:39.400]  That's the first thing to think about
[05:39.400 --> 05:40.660]  is not cause any fires.
[05:40.660 --> 05:43.700]  Then if you do, do you have something to notify you?
[05:43.700 --> 05:46.340]  Then think about the interaction with law enforcement
[05:46.340 --> 05:47.280]  and the fire department.
[05:47.280 --> 05:49.500]  Is it okay to have that grow where you have it?
[05:49.500 --> 05:50.940]  Do you have a way to get that fire out
[05:50.940 --> 05:51.860]  before they get there?
[05:51.860 --> 05:52.740]  Do you have a strategy?
[05:52.740 --> 05:53.900]  Do you have an excuse?
[05:53.900 --> 05:55.740]  Do you have a friend that you can call to help you out?
[05:55.740 --> 05:57.400]  Do you have something in place?
[05:57.400 --> 05:58.780]  Then once that alarm goes off,
[05:58.780 --> 06:00.900]  you have a way to put out that fire.
[06:00.900 --> 06:04.540]  They sell a lot of the cultivation stores,
[06:04.540 --> 06:06.660]  the hydroponic stores, the grow stores.
[06:06.660 --> 06:09.460]  A lot of the places sell a flame defender.
[06:09.460 --> 06:11.420]  Nobody pays me any money to say anything
[06:11.420 --> 06:12.520]  about these products.
[06:12.520 --> 06:15.780]  They sell a flame defender, a fire extinguisher
[06:15.780 --> 06:18.060]  that hangs from the ceiling of your grow space.
[06:18.140 --> 06:20.500]  If that grow space reaches a certain temperature,
[06:20.500 --> 06:23.540]  that thing will rupture and fire retardant powder
[06:23.540 --> 06:25.660]  will explode all over your grow space.
[06:25.660 --> 06:27.860]  It goes in a 360 degree pattern.
[06:27.860 --> 06:31.560]  It will spray and throw this disgusting dust all over.
[06:31.560 --> 06:32.940]  It will put out the fire,
[06:32.940 --> 06:34.960]  but it will ruin everything in that room.
[06:34.960 --> 06:36.840]  All of your grow gear will need a thorough cleaning.
[06:36.840 --> 06:39.160]  All of your plants are pretty much fucked at that point,
[06:39.160 --> 06:40.460]  but it will rescue a fire.
[06:40.460 --> 06:43.180]  So I'd recommend checking out the flame defender.
[06:43.180 --> 06:44.940]  Again, they don't pay me to advertise.
[06:44.940 --> 06:46.780]  I want you guys to be safe.
[06:46.780 --> 06:48.180]  The podcast is Grow From Your Heart.
[06:48.180 --> 06:49.100]  I care about people.
[06:49.100 --> 06:50.260]  I care about you guys.
[06:50.260 --> 06:51.140]  I saw something today.
[06:51.140 --> 06:53.060]  I thought maybe I could give you a hint and help you out.
[06:53.060 --> 06:54.900]  So they don't pay me to say this.
[06:54.900 --> 06:56.780]  Flame defender looks like a good product.
[06:56.780 --> 06:58.020]  It is a, I think that's what it's called.
[06:58.020 --> 06:59.220]  I forgot to Google and research.
[06:59.220 --> 07:00.580]  It's what I remember.
[07:00.580 --> 07:02.540]  It will put out a fire in case of a fire,
[07:02.540 --> 07:03.980]  and you don't even have to be there.
[07:03.980 --> 07:06.540]  It will just explode, rupture, put out the powder,
[07:06.540 --> 07:08.340]  and extinguish that fire for you.
[07:08.340 --> 07:11.980]  Or you've got the option to have a fire extinguisher.
[07:11.980 --> 07:14.980]  And if you do buy a fire extinguisher,
[07:14.980 --> 07:17.140]  it may be a good idea to pull the pin
[07:17.140 --> 07:18.460]  and give it a spray one time.
[07:18.460 --> 07:19.980]  Just see what that's like.
[07:19.980 --> 07:20.820]  Maybe practice.
[07:20.820 --> 07:23.460]  It's always, when you get a new job at a big facility,
[07:23.460 --> 07:25.580]  I've gotten jobs at like warehouses and factories
[07:25.580 --> 07:27.500]  and places where there could be fires.
[07:27.500 --> 07:29.860]  Oftentimes, I'm kind of a bigger dude
[07:29.860 --> 07:31.180]  and I'm ready, willing, and able.
[07:31.180 --> 07:32.560]  I've got fucking, I'm strong-minded.
[07:32.560 --> 07:33.460]  I'm kind of bossy.
[07:33.460 --> 07:34.660]  I can follow instructions.
[07:34.660 --> 07:35.980]  I'm one of the guys that gets trained
[07:35.980 --> 07:38.980]  on how to use the fire extinguisher all the time
[07:38.980 --> 07:41.340]  because they know that I can handle an emergency situation.
[07:41.340 --> 07:42.820]  That's just my mindset.
[07:42.860 --> 07:45.220]  So I've been trained on using the fire extinguisher.
[07:45.220 --> 07:48.220]  They do it in a commercial, in commercial grows.
[07:48.220 --> 07:50.380]  They do it in, what am I saying, industrial jobs.
[07:50.380 --> 07:52.180]  They do it in commercial jobs.
[07:52.180 --> 07:54.220]  So why not train yourself on it?
[07:54.220 --> 07:56.900]  Get ready, be prepared to use that fire extinguisher.
[07:56.900 --> 07:58.340]  I don't want you to have to use it.
[07:58.340 --> 07:59.160]  I really don't.
[07:59.160 --> 08:00.100]  I don't want there to be a fire.
[08:00.100 --> 08:01.580]  I don't want you to have to spray anything,
[08:01.580 --> 08:04.180]  but I'd rather you have the fire extinguisher
[08:04.180 --> 08:06.620]  and know how to use it instead of freak out
[08:06.620 --> 08:08.240]  and run down the street when the fire's happening
[08:08.240 --> 08:09.920]  and end up making things even worse.
[08:09.920 --> 08:11.980]  So I saw a fire today, you guys.
[08:11.980 --> 08:14.300]  It made me want to remind you to think about safety
[08:14.300 --> 08:15.140]  in the grow.
[08:15.140 --> 08:16.180]  That's something that often gets overlooked.
[08:16.180 --> 08:17.020]  We don't think about it.
[08:17.020 --> 08:19.260]  It's something I don't talk about enough probably.
[08:19.260 --> 08:22.140]  Being an advocate, a teacher, an educator,
[08:22.140 --> 08:23.940]  whatever you want to call me here in the cannabis space,
[08:23.940 --> 08:27.340]  a podcaster, I think it is part of my responsibility
[08:27.340 --> 08:29.940]  to remind you not to be that grower.
[08:29.940 --> 08:31.520]  Don't burn the shit down.
[08:31.520 --> 08:33.940]  Don't burn it down until it's dried and cured, bro.
[08:33.940 --> 08:36.640]  All right, let's get off of this topic of seeing a fire.
[08:36.640 --> 08:37.820]  That was a huge fire.
[08:37.820 --> 08:38.800]  Get your shit together.
[08:38.800 --> 08:40.400]  Be ready for that.
[08:40.400 --> 08:42.120]  That was a lot of smoke that I saw today.
[08:42.120 --> 08:44.400]  Also, I hope everybody's safe.
[08:44.400 --> 08:45.520]  Yeah, that's all I could say about that.
[08:45.520 --> 08:46.360]  Let's keep moving.
[08:46.360 --> 08:47.320]  There is an email here.
[08:47.320 --> 08:50.320]  It says, this one comes from our friend, Dio.
[08:50.320 --> 08:51.440]  What up, Dio?
[08:51.440 --> 08:52.720]  It goes a lot like this.
[08:52.720 --> 08:54.240]  It says, hey, Ross to Jeff.
[08:54.240 --> 08:56.360]  I'm somewhat new to helping people out
[08:56.360 --> 08:57.720]  with the flowers I grow.
[08:57.720 --> 08:59.300]  Well, thank you for helping.
[08:59.300 --> 09:02.320]  Even if you're new, you're helping and that's what matters.
[09:02.320 --> 09:05.040]  It says, I have an older friend who is trying cannabis
[09:05.040 --> 09:07.200]  to deal with intense nerve pain.
[09:07.200 --> 09:08.440]  I hope that's helping.
[09:08.440 --> 09:11.600]  It says, she has got fibromyalgia and spinal stenosis
[09:11.600 --> 09:14.040]  to name a couple of her conditions.
[09:14.040 --> 09:15.200]  Sounds like she may have a few more
[09:15.200 --> 09:16.520]  that you didn't list off.
[09:16.520 --> 09:18.320]  I hope we find some medicine that works well
[09:18.320 --> 09:19.760]  for your friend here.
[09:19.760 --> 09:22.160]  Big up and fist bump to you for helping somebody.
[09:22.160 --> 09:25.080]  It says, her pain heavily affects what she can do,
[09:25.080 --> 09:26.740]  especially with her hands.
[09:26.740 --> 09:28.760]  Yes, I definitely understand that.
[09:28.760 --> 09:32.040]  It says, I've given her some flowers to see if it helps,
[09:32.040 --> 09:34.540]  but consumption, let's see, but smoking,
[09:34.540 --> 09:36.940]  consumption through smoking is rough.
[09:36.980 --> 09:38.260]  Oh, and when I say flowers,
[09:38.260 --> 09:40.180]  maybe I haven't made this clear.
[09:40.180 --> 09:43.060]  When I say flowers, I'm just kind of in the industry.
[09:43.060 --> 09:44.340]  I'm an industry snob, I guess.
[09:44.340 --> 09:46.020]  When we say flowers, we mean buds.
[09:46.020 --> 09:49.300]  We mean weed, the dried buds, the parts you wanna smoke,
[09:49.300 --> 09:52.940]  the herbs, the buds, the nugs, that's flowers.
[09:52.940 --> 09:54.460]  And then if you talk about concentrates,
[09:54.460 --> 09:55.920]  we just say concentrates.
[09:55.920 --> 09:58.620]  So you can get flowers, concentrates, edibles,
[09:58.620 --> 10:00.420]  and then you can actually get clones and plants.
[10:00.420 --> 10:01.940]  Those are the things that are available.
[10:01.940 --> 10:03.580]  So when I'm saying flowers,
[10:03.580 --> 10:06.780]  I'm talking about dried and cured buds that are smokable.
[10:07.620 --> 10:09.260]  That's what our friend here is referring to as well.
[10:09.260 --> 10:11.820]  So our friend has given our,
[10:11.820 --> 10:13.620]  we're gonna call this person your patient.
[10:13.620 --> 10:16.740]  You've given your patient some herb
[10:16.740 --> 10:19.340]  and she's got fibromyalgia and spinal stenosis
[10:19.340 --> 10:20.900]  and her hands are limited.
[10:20.900 --> 10:21.980]  She can't do things with her hands
[10:21.980 --> 10:24.140]  and smoking the flower is difficult.
[10:24.140 --> 10:25.940]  She can't roll joints with her hand pain
[10:25.940 --> 10:29.060]  and it seems, it even makes
[10:29.060 --> 10:31.560]  for properly holding the pipe difficult.
[10:31.560 --> 10:32.400]  So that's gotta be rough.
[10:32.400 --> 10:33.520]  She can't hold the pipe and light it
[10:33.520 --> 10:34.780]  with a lighter properly
[10:34.820 --> 10:37.980]  because her hands are losing strength and getting sore.
[10:37.980 --> 10:41.220]  It says, I've brought up some fancy flower vaporizers
[10:41.220 --> 10:42.380]  that might ease the process,
[10:42.380 --> 10:45.260]  but the price point for something decent is a bit high.
[10:45.260 --> 10:47.880]  Yes, unfortunately the price point is quite high
[10:47.880 --> 10:49.500]  for getting yourself into one of those
[10:49.500 --> 10:50.980]  electric smoking devices.
[10:50.980 --> 10:51.820]  And you have to be careful
[10:51.820 --> 10:55.140]  because you don't wanna smoke the polyurethane stuff
[10:55.140 --> 10:57.460]  and the wire coating and you wanna get a good product
[10:57.460 --> 10:59.180]  so you don't smoke a bunch of bullshit.
[10:59.180 --> 11:01.460]  But they are quite expensive.
[11:01.460 --> 11:03.800]  It says, I plan on letting her try my volcano
[11:03.840 --> 11:04.960]  on my next trip to visit.
[11:04.960 --> 11:07.760]  I've also brought her some homemade can of salve
[11:07.760 --> 11:09.560]  with other medicinal herbs in it.
[11:09.560 --> 11:10.920]  She's a light user at best,
[11:10.920 --> 11:15.240]  so concentrates are out of the question for now.
[11:15.240 --> 11:17.560]  All right, so it sounds like our friend is gonna ask
[11:17.560 --> 11:21.640]  how he can more easily medicate our new patient here.
[11:21.640 --> 11:24.280]  It sounds like the condition is making it tough.
[11:24.280 --> 11:26.260]  They can't smoke because they can't hold the pipe properly.
[11:26.260 --> 11:27.640]  They can't roll joints.
[11:28.640 --> 11:31.640]  Man, they are very lucky to have a friend like you.
[11:31.640 --> 11:34.760]  That is something that is very beneficial to this person.
[11:34.760 --> 11:37.560]  Not only are they going to get medicated through cannabis,
[11:37.560 --> 11:38.800]  they're gonna get some relief that way
[11:38.800 --> 11:40.620]  once we get them dialed in with their dosage
[11:40.620 --> 11:42.840]  and the proper strain and all the stuff that they need.
[11:42.840 --> 11:45.660]  But also a huge part of medicating with cannabis,
[11:45.660 --> 11:48.500]  in my opinion, in my experience, in my belief,
[11:48.500 --> 11:50.680]  is the social aspect.
[11:50.680 --> 11:53.920]  We feel better when we are with people
[11:53.920 --> 11:55.200]  that we enjoy being with.
[11:55.200 --> 11:56.040]  It just feels good, right?
[11:56.040 --> 11:58.960]  What's, like being here right here by me, by myself,
[11:58.960 --> 11:59.840]  this is cool.
[11:59.840 --> 12:02.200]  But if you put Mike right there or Clint right there,
[12:02.200 --> 12:03.520]  the party's gonna be way better.
[12:03.520 --> 12:04.640]  There's gonna be two of us.
[12:04.640 --> 12:06.760]  So it'd be twice the vibes, twice the energy.
[12:06.760 --> 12:09.120]  You could even put somebody I don't know right there.
[12:09.120 --> 12:10.560]  And as long as they're not a fucking psycho,
[12:10.560 --> 12:11.840]  and even if they are a psychopath,
[12:11.840 --> 12:13.700]  I could still probably have a good time with them.
[12:13.700 --> 12:15.280]  It's gonna get better.
[12:15.280 --> 12:17.160]  Almost everything you do is better with people.
[12:17.160 --> 12:19.280]  And if you add a couple more people and a couple more people,
[12:19.280 --> 12:21.020]  that's why festivals are so cool.
[12:21.020 --> 12:22.280]  The vibe just gets stronger.
[12:22.280 --> 12:23.620]  We all spread the energy.
[12:23.620 --> 12:25.120]  It feels good to be social.
[12:25.120 --> 12:27.040]  I think that smoking with this person
[12:27.040 --> 12:29.280]  and being a good friend to this person
[12:30.000 --> 12:31.520]  we call this a caregiver situation
[12:31.520 --> 12:32.980]  is what this used to be in Colorado.
[12:32.980 --> 12:34.580]  You are this person's caregiver.
[12:34.580 --> 12:37.040]  You've decided to take caregiver responsibilities
[12:37.040 --> 12:39.380]  as a cannabis caregiver to this person.
[12:39.380 --> 12:40.820]  That is a huge part.
[12:40.820 --> 12:43.320]  The social aspect and hanging out, smoking,
[12:43.320 --> 12:45.500]  caring for this person is a huge part
[12:45.500 --> 12:47.360]  of the medicinal aspect of cannabis.
[12:47.360 --> 12:49.400]  When you smoke, at least for me,
[12:49.400 --> 12:51.240]  if you've ever been around me in person,
[12:51.240 --> 12:53.280]  I'll take a big dab and set down the dab rig
[12:53.280 --> 12:56.120]  and blow out the smoke and just start fucking talking.
[12:56.120 --> 12:57.840]  I love being social and hanging out
[12:57.840 --> 12:59.760]  and being around people after I smoke.
[12:59.760 --> 13:02.400]  And this person, they're in pain, they're hurting,
[13:02.400 --> 13:03.560]  they're not feeling good.
[13:03.560 --> 13:05.680]  And so as soon as they smoke, they're gonna feel better.
[13:05.680 --> 13:07.600]  They're gonna wanna chit chat and you're gonna be there
[13:07.600 --> 13:09.520]  and you're gonna fire their conversation up
[13:09.520 --> 13:11.880]  and give them ideas and you're gonna help them
[13:11.880 --> 13:13.560]  mainly forget that they're in pain,
[13:13.560 --> 13:14.960]  forget that they've got problems.
[13:14.960 --> 13:16.500]  That's what our friends do for us.
[13:16.500 --> 13:18.960]  We've all got bills to pay and shit on our mind
[13:18.960 --> 13:19.940]  and things to worry about.
[13:19.940 --> 13:21.900]  But when you got friends and you smoke,
[13:21.900 --> 13:23.800]  a lot of that shit goes out of your mind for a minute.
[13:23.800 --> 13:24.640]  You can't escape it.
[13:24.640 --> 13:25.680]  You can't run from it.
[13:25.680 --> 13:27.920]  It's got to be dealt with, but it's good for you
[13:27.920 --> 13:29.960]  to get away, get some giggles, get some laughter,
[13:29.960 --> 13:31.200]  get some social interaction.
[13:31.200 --> 13:33.220]  So your friend is very lucky to have you,
[13:33.220 --> 13:35.440]  very blessed to have a caregiver like you
[13:35.440 --> 13:37.560]  that is concerned enough to reach out to me
[13:37.560 --> 13:39.160]  to find better ways to help.
[13:39.160 --> 13:41.060]  I am rambling here.
[13:41.060 --> 13:43.100]  You said that you wanna let her try the volcano
[13:43.100 --> 13:43.940]  on the next trip.
[13:43.940 --> 13:45.800]  I really think that's gonna be the best ways
[13:45.800 --> 13:46.840]  to go about it.
[13:46.840 --> 13:50.160]  It does say though, I recently pushed her some info
[13:50.160 --> 13:52.940]  on how to make some canna butter out of the flour I gave her
[13:52.980 --> 13:56.100]  because it seems lightly ingested doses through the day
[13:56.100 --> 13:58.140]  may be her best at managing pain.
[13:58.140 --> 14:00.980]  That is probably accurate, but you've got to be careful
[14:00.980 --> 14:03.860]  in adjusting her into edibles because,
[14:03.860 --> 14:07.180]  you know as well as I do, a little bit too much edibles
[14:07.180 --> 14:09.200]  can be way too much edibles.
[14:09.200 --> 14:12.560]  So that five milligrams over the limit for a new consumer
[14:12.560 --> 14:14.700]  could definitely take the experience from like,
[14:14.700 --> 14:17.420]  oh, this feels good to, oh shit, this is not a good time.
[14:17.420 --> 14:18.740]  I never wanna do this.
[14:18.740 --> 14:20.500]  We definitely don't wanna scare your friend
[14:20.500 --> 14:21.460]  away from cannabis.
[14:21.460 --> 14:23.940]  We wanna ease her into cannabis as medicine.
[14:23.940 --> 14:25.500]  And that's how you do any other medicine.
[14:25.500 --> 14:26.700]  You would ease in, you wouldn't jump in
[14:26.700 --> 14:28.620]  with a fucking heroic dose of anything.
[14:28.620 --> 14:31.760]  So be careful, ease her in slowly with the doses.
[14:31.760 --> 14:34.300]  It says there's another option in tinctures,
[14:34.300 --> 14:36.500]  but I don't have the knowledge or equipment to make it
[14:36.500 --> 14:40.140]  and it's expensive locally, might not be her first choice.
[14:40.140 --> 14:41.940]  Is there any way of consuming dry flour
[14:41.940 --> 14:45.460]  that is a bit more accessible with limited use of the hands?
[14:45.460 --> 14:47.620]  Depending on how the butter works for her,
[14:47.620 --> 14:50.140]  it might be the best fit, thanks in advance.
[14:50.140 --> 14:52.100]  And then he wraps it up here with a lot of great stuff.
[14:52.100 --> 14:53.620]  Dio, thank you for the great message,
[14:53.620 --> 14:55.920]  big up on you for helping this patient,
[14:55.920 --> 14:57.620]  this client of yours.
[14:57.620 --> 15:00.500]  I really think that the edibles would be a great way to go.
[15:00.500 --> 15:05.020]  She's going to get longer relief, better acting relief,
[15:05.020 --> 15:07.980]  more effective relief that it's gonna get inside the body
[15:07.980 --> 15:08.820]  and get in there deeper.
[15:08.820 --> 15:11.340]  I feel like edibles, when you eat it, it knows where to go.
[15:11.340 --> 15:12.500]  And it's like, I'm gonna go right there
[15:12.500 --> 15:15.100]  and make your pain go away and the edibles will work.
[15:16.220 --> 15:18.980]  Also, smoking isn't really healthy.
[15:18.980 --> 15:21.180]  It sounds like your friend's got enough health concerns
[15:21.180 --> 15:22.620]  and enough problems already.
[15:22.620 --> 15:26.940]  Smoking isn't really, I guess I'm a hypocrite here
[15:26.940 --> 15:29.300]  because I take gigantic dabs all day.
[15:29.300 --> 15:32.360]  But if this person isn't already smoking
[15:32.360 --> 15:35.020]  and doesn't have the habit and the comfort of it,
[15:35.020 --> 15:36.500]  maybe edibles would be the way to go.
[15:36.500 --> 15:38.800]  Let's just save their lungs and keep them healthy.
[15:38.800 --> 15:40.440]  They have enough health concerns.
[15:40.440 --> 15:42.080]  We don't need to introduce lung problems
[15:42.080 --> 15:44.660]  and a cough into this scenario here.
[15:44.660 --> 15:47.120]  So let's give them edibles and see how that goes.
[15:48.120 --> 15:50.520]  Also, I do really think that the volcano
[15:50.520 --> 15:52.920]  is going to be a great option,
[15:52.920 --> 15:55.560]  a great effective way of consuming
[15:55.560 --> 15:57.040]  because you can fill that bag
[15:57.040 --> 15:59.760]  and then you gotta push that little thing
[15:59.760 --> 16:01.000]  on the volcano to make it work.
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  But as long as she can use two hands or make that click,
[16:04.000 --> 16:04.840]  that would work.
[16:04.840 --> 16:06.760]  Also, there's gotta be a way you can rig the volcano bag
[16:06.760 --> 16:09.980]  open for her so that she can use it when you're not there.
[16:11.400 --> 16:12.820]  Yeah, smoking isn't really good.
[16:12.820 --> 16:14.800]  So I would say work on the edibles
[16:14.800 --> 16:17.560]  would be one of the things that I would definitely work on.
[16:17.560 --> 16:19.840]  Now, I did compliment you on being a great caregiver.
[16:19.840 --> 16:21.680]  A piece of advice that I would recommend
[16:21.680 --> 16:23.400]  is if you do go the edible route,
[16:23.400 --> 16:26.000]  maybe give her the edibles when you can be there
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.980]  for the next at least two to four, maybe six hours.
[16:28.980 --> 16:30.180]  You might wanna hang out
[16:30.180 --> 16:32.280]  or at least be able to stay for a few hours
[16:32.280 --> 16:34.720]  and see if she freaks the heck out
[16:34.720 --> 16:36.920]  or just be able to pop in occasionally
[16:36.920 --> 16:38.400]  and make sure she doesn't need anything.
[16:38.400 --> 16:40.240]  If you can't stick around for the whole duration
[16:40.240 --> 16:42.220]  of the time, make sure you could stay until it kicks in,
[16:42.220 --> 16:43.600]  make sure she's comfortable,
[16:43.600 --> 16:44.760]  then go handle your business,
[16:44.760 --> 16:46.240]  then come back maybe every hour
[16:46.240 --> 16:48.220]  or maybe every hour and a half or two hours.
[16:48.220 --> 16:50.080]  Make sure she doesn't need anything.
[16:50.080 --> 16:52.320]  Sometimes around hour four, maybe hour six,
[16:52.320 --> 16:54.320]  those edibles will change gears on you
[16:54.320 --> 16:55.640]  and she'll just be stuck in a corner
[16:55.640 --> 16:56.880]  wishing that you'd bring her a peanut butter
[16:56.880 --> 16:59.040]  and jelly sandwich and a Dr. Pepper or something.
[16:59.040 --> 17:01.500]  Maybe that's all she needs to save her life at that point.
[17:01.500 --> 17:04.240]  But I do recommend going the edible route.
[17:04.240 --> 17:05.960]  I also highly recommend you hang out
[17:05.960 --> 17:07.320]  while you give her the edibles.
[17:07.320 --> 17:08.700]  Stick around, make sure she's safe,
[17:08.700 --> 17:10.500]  make sure she's comfortable,
[17:10.500 --> 17:14.140]  get some good snacks available, some healthy snacks,
[17:14.140 --> 17:16.060]  get some good conversation in your mind prepared,
[17:16.060 --> 17:18.060]  maybe have some good Netflix prepared,
[17:18.060 --> 17:21.960]  do a friendly Netflix chill and edibles session,
[17:21.960 --> 17:23.340]  see how that goes.
[17:23.340 --> 17:26.300]  One ironic thing, it's terrible that I think this route,
[17:26.300 --> 17:28.920]  but one thing I think is ironic in the cannabis industry,
[17:28.920 --> 17:30.620]  we sell all these products to people
[17:30.620 --> 17:31.980]  to make them feel better.
[17:31.980 --> 17:33.500]  And then one of the most frustrating things
[17:33.500 --> 17:35.940]  is that we put all these products in childproof containers
[17:35.940 --> 17:38.600]  and the people with hand problems can't even open them.
[17:38.600 --> 17:39.940]  So I understand the struggle.
[17:40.380 --> 17:41.780]  I've got good hands and sometimes
[17:41.780 --> 17:43.520]  I can't even get the products open.
[17:43.520 --> 17:45.860]  So I understand how frustrating it could be.
[17:45.860 --> 17:47.820]  My dude, Dio, you are a great person
[17:47.820 --> 17:49.580]  for helping out your friend.
[17:49.580 --> 17:51.700]  I really hope that the edibles work.
[17:51.700 --> 17:53.180]  I really hope you can find a way
[17:53.180 --> 17:54.540]  to dose the edibles properly.
[17:54.540 --> 17:58.100]  If you could get some lab tested edibles,
[17:58.100 --> 17:58.920]  that would be ideal.
[17:58.920 --> 18:00.140]  But I understand we've all got to work
[18:00.140 --> 18:01.460]  within our means and with our budget.
[18:01.460 --> 18:03.620]  I don't even know if you're in a legal place,
[18:03.620 --> 18:05.900]  but I think edibles would be the way to go.
[18:05.900 --> 18:08.100]  Definitely, oh, I was gonna recommend also
[18:08.100 --> 18:09.200]  another vaporizer.
[18:09.200 --> 18:10.640]  You said the Volcano.
[18:10.640 --> 18:14.360]  I have experience with the Vapor Brothers Vaporizer.
[18:14.360 --> 18:17.560]  It's a small, looks like a wooden box with the whip.
[18:17.560 --> 18:19.380]  The tube comes out of it that you hit.
[18:19.380 --> 18:21.240]  That's real easy for someone to manage,
[18:21.240 --> 18:24.720]  even if you have minimal hand abilities.
[18:24.720 --> 18:26.480]  All you have to do is grind up the herb
[18:26.480 --> 18:29.360]  that maybe you could go pre-grind up a bunch of herb for,
[18:29.360 --> 18:31.200]  give her like an eighth or a quarter of ground up herb
[18:31.200 --> 18:32.440]  that's ready to go.
[18:32.440 --> 18:34.200]  Then all she's got to do is fill the whip.
[18:34.200 --> 18:35.040]  You know what I mean?
[18:35.040 --> 18:36.700]  Like if you guys have used a vaporizer,
[18:36.700 --> 18:38.160]  you know which part the whip is.
[18:38.160 --> 18:39.120]  You just got to fill the whip
[18:39.120 --> 18:42.280]  and get it up onto the heating element and then let it heat.
[18:42.280 --> 18:43.400]  All she's got to do at that point
[18:43.400 --> 18:45.680]  is grab the other end of the whip and inhale
[18:45.680 --> 18:47.920]  and smoke the vape.
[18:47.920 --> 18:50.600]  And you know, it won't even, if you set it the right temp,
[18:50.600 --> 18:52.280]  the herb doesn't burn until you're,
[18:52.280 --> 18:53.960]  it doesn't vaporize until you draw through it
[18:53.960 --> 18:56.600]  because you have to move the heat over the herb.
[18:56.600 --> 18:58.000]  It's not constantly heating.
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.040]  So the Vapor Brothers device is another option
[19:00.040 --> 19:01.540]  that I may recommend.
[19:01.540 --> 19:03.600]  Check out Vapor Brothers, good product.
[19:03.600 --> 19:05.720]  Again, those guys don't pay me at all.
[19:05.720 --> 19:06.560]  It's a good product.
[19:06.560 --> 19:07.380]  I used to have one.
[19:07.380 --> 19:09.340]  I used it, it was great.
[19:09.340 --> 19:11.700]  Also, the Buda is very similar.
[19:11.700 --> 19:13.300]  The Buda and the Silver Surfer,
[19:13.300 --> 19:15.960]  they're all, the Vapor Brothers, the Buda, the Silver Surfer,
[19:15.960 --> 19:19.620]  in my opinion, they're all going to be similar quality
[19:19.620 --> 19:20.620]  for their price point.
[19:20.620 --> 19:22.300]  They're all gonna be great for what they cost.
[19:22.300 --> 19:23.940]  They're all effective for their price point.
[19:23.940 --> 19:25.340]  Again, nobody pays me.
[19:25.340 --> 19:26.940]  I'm just talking out of experience
[19:26.940 --> 19:28.440]  and things that I have used.
[19:29.740 --> 19:30.980]  My other advice, eventually,
[19:30.980 --> 19:32.340]  you said that she's a new smoker
[19:32.340 --> 19:34.060]  and dabs would probably wreck her.
[19:34.060 --> 19:36.140]  Eventually, she's gonna want to move up to dabs
[19:36.140 --> 19:40.700]  because concentrates are more cost-effective, in my opinion.
[19:40.700 --> 19:42.780]  And at that point, that's when I would go with the Puffco.
[19:42.780 --> 19:45.100]  The Puffco would be super easy for this person.
[19:45.100 --> 19:47.860]  However, right now, I think the Vapor Bros,
[19:47.860 --> 19:50.540]  the Volcano, or some good old-fashioned edibles
[19:50.540 --> 19:51.620]  are the way to go.
[19:51.620 --> 19:53.420]  My dude, Dio, thank you for the great message.
[19:53.420 --> 19:55.900]  I hope we were able to help your friend out.
[19:55.900 --> 19:58.880]  Big on you, big up to you for helping out people
[19:58.880 --> 20:01.780]  and taking it upon yourself to be that kind of a friend.
[20:01.780 --> 20:04.000]  The world needs more people like you.
[20:04.000 --> 20:05.500]  Go smoke a joint with your friend.
[20:05.540 --> 20:07.580]  Tom Rasta Jeff said, what's up?
[20:07.580 --> 20:09.660]  All right, this message came from my friend,
[20:09.660 --> 20:11.340]  Yee Motherfuckin' Ha.
[20:11.340 --> 20:13.360]  Shout out to my buddy, Yee Motherfuckin' Ha.
[20:13.360 --> 20:15.460]  Great dude, good grower.
[20:15.460 --> 20:17.000]  All the other stuff is questionable.
[20:17.000 --> 20:17.860]  This message says,
[20:17.860 --> 20:20.220]  just in case you read this on the podcast,
[20:20.220 --> 20:22.480]  big salute to the Irie Army.
[20:22.480 --> 20:23.320]  Big salute, brother.
[20:23.320 --> 20:25.040]  Thank you for being a part of the Irie Army.
[20:25.040 --> 20:26.540]  Thank you for letting me pick on you.
[20:26.540 --> 20:27.780]  Always a good time.
[20:27.780 --> 20:31.740]  It says, I have a question about small-scale pheno hunting.
[20:31.740 --> 20:33.300]  That is a very good question.
[20:33.300 --> 20:34.940]  It says, if the goal is to sift through
[20:35.380 --> 20:36.860]  as many new plants as possible
[20:36.860 --> 20:38.940]  while identifying the keepers and winners,
[20:38.940 --> 20:40.820]  do you think it would be better to clone everything
[20:40.820 --> 20:44.080]  before I flip or reveg plants that show themselves
[20:44.080 --> 20:47.020]  to be the most worthy once they have flowered?
[20:47.020 --> 20:48.300]  That is a very good question.
[20:48.300 --> 20:50.180]  I've got a very good answer for that.
[20:50.180 --> 20:51.940]  However, there is more to the message.
[20:51.940 --> 20:54.880]  It says, typically, I try and make it my practice
[20:54.880 --> 20:59.140]  to always take at least one clone of every plant
[20:59.140 --> 21:00.460]  before I flip it to flower.
[21:00.460 --> 21:02.560]  However, that is a lot of clones
[21:02.560 --> 21:04.620]  and a small space to hang onto
[21:05.260 --> 21:06.940]  while determining if I need to run them again.
[21:06.940 --> 21:09.180]  Yes, that is completely understandable.
[21:09.180 --> 21:10.340]  I totally get it.
[21:10.340 --> 21:12.300]  Being a breeder, being somebody
[21:12.300 --> 21:14.020]  that does a lot of pheno hunts,
[21:14.020 --> 21:15.500]  this is one of my struggles,
[21:15.500 --> 21:18.060]  especially since Colorado has got me limited
[21:18.060 --> 21:20.780]  down to so few plants to do a pheno hunt.
[21:20.780 --> 21:22.540]  I definitely, cutting clones,
[21:22.540 --> 21:24.420]  you just doubled your numbers immediately.
[21:24.420 --> 21:26.820]  So I understand the struggle here.
[21:26.820 --> 21:27.660]  It goes on, though.
[21:27.660 --> 21:28.480]  There's more.
[21:28.480 --> 21:29.940]  It says, it's a lot of clones.
[21:29.940 --> 21:33.380]  Okay, recently, I recently had a round of clones fail
[21:33.380 --> 21:34.980]  and I have one plant that I'm thinking
[21:34.980 --> 21:36.420]  I will have to reveg
[21:36.420 --> 21:38.720]  because I wanna take her out on some more dates.
[21:38.720 --> 21:40.300]  I love the way you think about that.
[21:40.300 --> 21:41.560]  As I'm thinking about this,
[21:41.560 --> 21:44.500]  I realized that reveging those that stand out only
[21:44.500 --> 21:46.940]  might take a bit longer
[21:46.940 --> 21:49.220]  but would lessen the amount of clones that I care for
[21:49.220 --> 21:51.980]  and potentially could save me space.
[21:51.980 --> 21:53.740]  It sounds like you're on the right track, bro.
[21:53.740 --> 21:55.620]  It sounds like you were on a good path.
[21:55.620 --> 21:56.800]  One thing I'm gonna jump in,
[21:56.800 --> 21:59.280]  I'm gonna interrupt myself here.
[21:59.280 --> 22:02.480]  The reveging process might take a little bit longer.
[22:03.540 --> 22:06.260]  Do you do the 18-6 method that I talk about?
[22:06.260 --> 22:08.340]  At the end of flower, when you begin flushing,
[22:08.340 --> 22:11.060]  flip those lights to 18-6.
[22:11.060 --> 22:13.540]  Then the plants will speed up a little bit more quickly
[22:13.540 --> 22:15.880]  that they're already going back to revege.
[22:15.880 --> 22:17.620]  Of course, this is hard to do
[22:17.620 --> 22:19.140]  because you're doing a pheno hunt.
[22:19.140 --> 22:21.300]  So maybe you haven't ran these plants before.
[22:21.300 --> 22:23.780]  But when you know you're gonna harvest in a couple days,
[22:23.780 --> 22:24.700]  you could flip them early.
[22:24.700 --> 22:25.780]  You could turn them back.
[22:25.780 --> 22:28.860]  It doesn't matter if it's 14 days, 10, seven, five.
[22:28.860 --> 22:30.620]  Any days ahead are days ahead.
[22:30.620 --> 22:33.560]  So that will get you sped up on the revege process.
[22:33.560 --> 22:34.860]  That'll get you going.
[22:34.860 --> 22:36.020]  There's more to it.
[22:36.020 --> 22:37.940]  It says, I also like the idea
[22:37.940 --> 22:40.560]  of not growing out a bunch of clones just to kill them.
[22:40.560 --> 22:42.660]  That is a very, very great point.
[22:42.660 --> 22:44.020]  If they're not what I'm looking for
[22:44.020 --> 22:46.420]  or growing out something okay just because I had a clone,
[22:46.420 --> 22:48.200]  oh, that's another good thing I didn't think about.
[22:48.200 --> 22:49.760]  Sometimes you might just grow that plant
[22:49.760 --> 22:50.940]  just because the clone exists.
[22:50.940 --> 22:52.040]  You didn't even need it.
[22:52.040 --> 22:53.280]  Not a quality plant.
[22:53.280 --> 22:54.220]  Never thought of that route.
[22:54.220 --> 22:57.060]  That's a good way to give yourself some discipline.
[22:57.060 --> 22:58.260]  He wraps it up by saying,
[22:58.260 --> 23:01.060]  I feel that both cloning and revege arguments
[23:01.060 --> 23:02.100]  have their merits.
[23:02.100 --> 23:04.500]  And I'm curious to get your thoughts on the topic.
[23:04.500 --> 23:07.100]  What strategy would you use if you were hunting
[23:07.100 --> 23:08.940]  in a basement with a few tents?
[23:08.940 --> 23:13.180]  Big love and respect from your dude, Yee motherfucking Ha.
[23:13.180 --> 23:14.020]  Thank you, bro.
[23:14.020 --> 23:15.500]  This is a great question.
[23:15.500 --> 23:17.860]  I understand the struggle completely.
[23:17.860 --> 23:19.960]  I definitely do because I like to do
[23:19.960 --> 23:21.220]  a lot of pheno hunts myself.
[23:21.220 --> 23:23.860]  And like I said earlier, if I pop a pack of seeds,
[23:23.860 --> 23:25.140]  I'm allowed 12 plants.
[23:25.140 --> 23:28.240]  If I pop 10 seeds, I'm already really close to the limit.
[23:29.220 --> 23:30.040]  If I cut clones of all of those,
[23:30.040 --> 23:31.720]  I'm definitely in the illegal zone.
[23:31.720 --> 23:35.840]  By the time those clones root, I am in an illegal timeframe.
[23:35.840 --> 23:38.400]  One thing you could do is you could cut those clones
[23:38.400 --> 23:39.360]  a little bit later.
[23:39.360 --> 23:41.840]  You can cut them right as the plant goes into flower,
[23:41.840 --> 23:43.560]  then cut the clones.
[23:43.560 --> 23:44.880]  That'll save you a couple of weeks,
[23:44.880 --> 23:47.000]  but that's not the way that I'm gonna recommend.
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.560]  I think you've got the right idea.
[23:48.560 --> 23:51.480]  The way that you are thinking about reveging,
[23:51.480 --> 23:54.360]  I definitely think you've got the right strategy.
[23:54.360 --> 23:56.880]  The idea is to grow a pack of seeds
[23:56.880 --> 23:59.280]  and find the best one out of there.
[23:59.280 --> 24:01.560]  And people talk about growing a bunch of seeds.
[24:01.560 --> 24:03.040]  I think you should find,
[24:03.040 --> 24:05.000]  I think if you buy a 10-pack of my seeds,
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.200]  you'll probably find the keeper in the 10-pack.
[24:07.200 --> 24:09.080]  There'll be one, maybe two gems in there
[24:09.080 --> 24:09.920]  that really stand out.
[24:09.920 --> 24:11.880]  You shouldn't have to buy too many packs.
[24:11.880 --> 24:13.680]  But, so the idea is to run the 10-pack
[24:13.680 --> 24:15.600]  and find the gem in there.
[24:15.600 --> 24:18.440]  I do agree that the revege,
[24:18.440 --> 24:19.900]  since we're so limited on numbers,
[24:19.900 --> 24:21.520]  I agree completely that the revege
[24:21.520 --> 24:23.100]  is a great strategy for doing this.
[24:23.100 --> 24:25.760]  So I would run my 10, and then I would,
[24:25.760 --> 24:27.840]  early on I'm gonna eliminate a bunch of boys.
[24:27.840 --> 24:29.360]  So now you could just cut out a bunch of boys.
[24:29.360 --> 24:30.560]  I probably got five left.
[24:30.560 --> 24:31.940]  I'm gonna keep an eye on them.
[24:31.940 --> 24:33.760]  You're already gonna know that that one over there
[24:33.760 --> 24:36.560]  is too stretchy or just too short or too shitty.
[24:36.560 --> 24:37.960]  You already know that number five is gone.
[24:37.960 --> 24:39.240]  Now you're down to four.
[24:39.240 --> 24:40.880]  So now you've only got four left.
[24:40.880 --> 24:43.700]  Definitely I would revege the best two at the end.
[24:44.560 --> 24:46.000]  And we'll talk about revege real quick.
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.360]  I would cut off, harvest almost everything
[24:48.360 --> 24:51.300]  except like somewhere between two and five
[24:51.300 --> 24:53.880]  little buds on the bottom, just thumb-sized buds.
[24:53.880 --> 24:55.680]  My thumbs aren't super big.
[24:56.520 --> 24:58.240]  Thumb-sized nuggets and leave foliage.
[24:58.240 --> 24:59.080]  You need leaves.
[24:59.080 --> 25:01.200]  You can't just revege sticks.
[25:01.200 --> 25:02.320]  You need some foliage on there.
[25:02.320 --> 25:04.540]  A bud with a couple of leaves on it is ideal.
[25:04.540 --> 25:07.020]  Somewhere between two and five thumb-sized nuggets
[25:07.020 --> 25:08.400]  is all you need.
[25:08.400 --> 25:10.000]  If your plant is root bound,
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.360]  I would re-pot it to a bigger pot at this time.
[25:12.360 --> 25:15.520]  That will encourage the reveging process.
[25:15.520 --> 25:16.520]  So you've cut everything down.
[25:16.520 --> 25:18.600]  You've left a couple of buds at the very bottom,
[25:18.600 --> 25:20.560]  two to five buds the size of my thumb.
[25:20.560 --> 25:23.640]  Put that plant under at least 18 hours of light,
[25:23.640 --> 25:26.160]  maybe 18, six, maybe 19, five.
[25:26.160 --> 25:29.000]  If you wanna get crazy, put it under 24 hours of light.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.600]  I really think some sleeping time does everything nicely.
[25:31.600 --> 25:34.000]  They really enjoy the sleepy time.
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.040]  You love a nap.
[25:35.040 --> 25:36.160]  The plants love a nap.
[25:36.160 --> 25:37.980]  Your equipment will appreciate the nap.
[25:37.980 --> 25:40.520]  Your electricity bill will enjoy the nap as well.
[25:40.520 --> 25:43.200]  So maybe put them under like 19 hours of light,
[25:43.200 --> 25:44.240]  five hours of darkness.
[25:44.240 --> 25:45.560]  If you wanna do 24,
[25:45.560 --> 25:47.960]  if you don't have a super intense light, do the 24.
[25:47.960 --> 25:50.040]  If you got a good light, you can adjust that.
[25:50.040 --> 25:51.860]  So I would cut down almost everything
[25:51.860 --> 25:53.980]  except the bottom five-ish nuggets.
[25:55.140 --> 25:57.240]  Up-pot it or do some root pruning
[25:57.240 --> 25:58.820]  if you're experienced in that.
[25:58.820 --> 26:02.340]  Then put it under 18, 19, maybe 20 hours of light,
[26:02.340 --> 26:03.460]  depending on the quality of light
[26:03.460 --> 26:04.600]  which you're able to give it.
[26:04.600 --> 26:07.200]  Then start feeding it a vegetative nutrient mix.
[26:07.200 --> 26:09.340]  Give it a high nitrogen diet.
[26:09.340 --> 26:12.100]  Then just feed it as normal, water it as normal,
[26:12.100 --> 26:12.940]  and then just wait.
[26:12.940 --> 26:14.940]  Eventually that plant will start to spit out
[26:14.940 --> 26:16.940]  new growth shoots.
[26:16.940 --> 26:19.100]  Sometimes they'll come out looking crazy.
[26:19.100 --> 26:20.580]  They'll be twisty and spindly,
[26:20.580 --> 26:22.340]  and they'll look like they've got problems.
[26:22.340 --> 26:23.960]  That's what you expect from a re-veg.
[26:23.960 --> 26:25.660]  Give that a little bit of time.
[26:25.660 --> 26:27.500]  It will begin to turn into normal leaves.
[26:27.500 --> 26:29.260]  You'll see, eventually it'll make,
[26:29.260 --> 26:31.100]  one day it'll just make a long normal shoot
[26:31.100 --> 26:32.540]  with beautiful leaves coming out of the top.
[26:32.540 --> 26:34.760]  You'll be like, oh, that's a normal weed plant again.
[26:34.760 --> 26:38.620]  What I recommend is to clone that new part.
[26:38.620 --> 26:41.380]  You've got that new fresh growth, clone that part.
[26:41.380 --> 26:42.900]  Make that the mother plant.
[26:42.900 --> 26:46.080]  Grow that part out, then cut clones from that.
[26:46.080 --> 26:47.540]  So it takes a little bit to get there,
[26:47.540 --> 26:49.580]  but that is the way I recommend it.
[26:49.580 --> 26:52.980]  Re-veg it, cut a clone, veg out the clone,
[26:52.980 --> 26:54.580]  then cut clones from that one
[26:54.580 --> 26:56.820]  so that you've got fresh plants to work with.
[26:56.820 --> 26:59.860]  So I think your strategy is a really good idea.
[26:59.860 --> 27:03.020]  That way you don't have to wait for those clones to root.
[27:03.020 --> 27:04.380]  You don't have to try to keep them alive.
[27:04.380 --> 27:06.060]  You don't have to waste space.
[27:06.060 --> 27:07.040]  You don't have to cut the clones.
[27:07.040 --> 27:07.880]  That takes a whole,
[27:07.880 --> 27:09.020]  that's a little bit of time right there,
[27:09.020 --> 27:10.860]  just depending on how many plants you've got.
[27:10.860 --> 27:13.100]  You wanna get two or three, maybe five cuts of everything.
[27:13.100 --> 27:14.540]  That's gonna take you a couple hours,
[27:14.540 --> 27:16.640]  maybe an hour right there just to fill the clone dome.
[27:16.640 --> 27:18.100]  So save yourself some time.
[27:18.100 --> 27:19.560]  Don't cut the clones that you don't need.
[27:20.340 --> 27:21.400]  Don't stress on keeping them alive.
[27:21.400 --> 27:23.480]  Don't double up your numbers.
[27:23.480 --> 27:25.800]  Focus on finding that plant that is perfect for you.
[27:25.800 --> 27:27.880]  We talk about phenotype selection a lot.
[27:27.880 --> 27:29.520]  Find that one that is perfect for you.
[27:29.520 --> 27:31.640]  Find the two that may be perfect for you.
[27:31.640 --> 27:34.240]  Select those, keep them, get them in re-veg,
[27:34.240 --> 27:36.040]  get them cloned again.
[27:36.040 --> 27:39.080]  Then what I recommend is have your favorite one or two,
[27:39.080 --> 27:40.400]  have a keeper plant of that,
[27:40.400 --> 27:41.560]  and then we're gonna do it again.
[27:41.560 --> 27:43.520]  We're gonna use your favorite two
[27:43.520 --> 27:44.820]  and we're gonna veg those up,
[27:44.820 --> 27:45.660]  but at the same time,
[27:45.660 --> 27:47.500]  we're gonna run another pack of seeds
[27:47.500 --> 27:50.060]  so that we can compare another pack of seeds
[27:50.060 --> 27:52.860]  to the two keepers, the one keeper we've already selected,
[27:52.860 --> 27:56.180]  and keep doing pheno hunts to find the best plants
[27:56.180 --> 27:59.140]  until you've got a room filled with the best plants.
[27:59.140 --> 28:01.680]  Right now, let's say that your legal limit is 10.
[28:01.680 --> 28:04.580]  Let's run 10 seeds and find a keeper out of that.
[28:04.580 --> 28:05.920]  Now you got one keeper out of that.
[28:05.920 --> 28:09.100]  Now let's run nine more seeds and fill all 10 spots
[28:09.100 --> 28:10.980]  and then find a keeper out of that one.
[28:10.980 --> 28:12.340]  And now we've got eight spots left.
[28:12.340 --> 28:15.100]  Let's pop eight more seeds until we fill that whole room
[28:15.100 --> 28:16.700]  with nothing but badass keepers,
[28:16.700 --> 28:19.100]  or at least the amount of keepers you desire,
[28:19.100 --> 28:21.940]  or at least maybe one marvelous plant
[28:21.940 --> 28:23.340]  that you just keep upgrading all the time.
[28:23.340 --> 28:25.020]  You're like, this one's better, we're keeping that.
[28:25.020 --> 28:26.620]  This one's better, we're keeping that.
[28:26.620 --> 28:28.820]  Keep striving, hunting for that best one.
[28:28.820 --> 28:30.700]  Then cut a bunch of clones of that.
[28:30.700 --> 28:33.780]  Then fill all of those tents with that bad bitch
[28:33.780 --> 28:35.060]  that you do find.
[28:35.060 --> 28:37.060]  So I think you've got the right idea, my dude.
[28:37.060 --> 28:38.780]  If you've got any follow-up questions,

[29:36.980 --> 29:38.220]  And if you've got the question,
[29:38.220 --> 29:40.260]  that probably means there are a lot of other growers

[29:53.380 --> 29:54.380]  for this episode.
[29:54.380 --> 29:56.780]  I wanna give a big shout out to my buddy Purple Skunk.
[29:56.780 --> 29:59.020]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[29:59.020 --> 30:00.580]  and give your mom a hug for me.
