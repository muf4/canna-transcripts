[02:12.770 --> 02:17.890]  Big shout out to all of my friends over there on the Discord server right now.
[02:17.890 --> 02:18.890]  All right.
[02:18.890 --> 02:20.410]  Let's jump right into it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20.410 --> 02:24.210]  I did say we were going to talk about some seasonal adjustments here.
[02:24.210 --> 02:26.050]  I am in Southern Colorado.
[02:26.050 --> 02:31.010]  It's not quite cold yet, but I do know that hoodie season is soon approaching.
[02:31.010 --> 02:32.010]  That's right.
[02:32.010 --> 02:33.130]  It's going to be fall here very soon.
[02:33.130 --> 02:37.090]  I'm surprised I haven't busted out the hoodie yet, but I want to be prepared.
[02:37.090 --> 02:39.630]  We're going to talk about this episode right now.
[02:39.630 --> 02:41.490]  We need to get ahead of the game.
[02:41.490 --> 02:46.330]  We don't need to have our equipment in the garage, dusty, dirty, under a tarp.
[02:46.330 --> 02:47.830]  Maybe you need to order it from Amazon.
[02:47.830 --> 02:49.470]  Maybe you need to figure that shit out.
[02:49.470 --> 02:51.970]  We don't need to be delayed on having equipment.
[02:51.970 --> 02:54.730]  We need to be ahead of the game for seasonal changes.
[02:54.730 --> 02:56.770]  That is something that is very important.
[02:56.770 --> 02:59.730]  The bigger the grow gets, the more important that is.
[02:59.730 --> 03:04.810]  It's very easy to change the environment, adjust the conditions in a smaller room.
[03:04.810 --> 03:12.050]  Once you start going four, six, 15, 20, 50, 100 lights, it gets increasingly more challenging
[03:12.050 --> 03:16.970]  to control the room, control the space, adjust to the outside environment.
[03:16.970 --> 03:22.530]  Last year in Colorado, we had a day where it was negative 17 degrees.
[03:22.530 --> 03:26.090]  That's one of the coldest weekends I've ever experienced that I can remember in my adult
[03:26.090 --> 03:27.090]  life.
[03:27.090 --> 03:30.690]  Absolutely one of the coldest experiences I can remember in my growing career.
[03:30.690 --> 03:34.170]  I do think I saw negative 24 at one point in my life.
[03:34.170 --> 03:38.450]  That negative 17 really put some stress on my grow space.
[03:38.450 --> 03:42.770]  We need to be prepared for things like negative 17 coming up pretty soon here.
[03:42.770 --> 03:46.610]  The conditions, the environment, the temperature changes rapidly.
[03:46.610 --> 03:52.050]  I, in Colorado, need to get my shit together and need to get my gear prepared, get a strategy
[03:52.050 --> 03:55.210]  in place, start thinking about what I'm going to do.
[03:55.210 --> 03:58.250]  What type of seasonal changes are coming in your location?
[03:58.250 --> 04:00.930]  You may be listening anywhere on the planet.
[04:00.930 --> 04:04.650]  Big shout out wherever you are, but think about the changes that are coming.
[04:04.650 --> 04:05.690]  Is it going to get colder?
[04:05.690 --> 04:07.030]  Is it going to get hotter?
[04:07.030 --> 04:08.070]  Will it be more humid?
[04:08.070 --> 04:09.130]  Will it get drier?
[04:09.130 --> 04:14.810]  What do you need to do to adjust your grow to set yourself up for success?
[04:14.810 --> 04:17.410]  That's one of my main goals of this podcast.
[04:17.410 --> 04:20.930]  My goal is to help you set yourself up for success.
[04:20.930 --> 04:22.530]  I've had a lot of trial and error.
[04:22.530 --> 04:23.970]  I've had a lot of experience.
[04:23.970 --> 04:28.490]  I want to take a lot of that experience and cut out a lot of bullshit, get you right to
[04:28.490 --> 04:33.050]  the point, set you up for success, tell you a lot of things will fail, try to show you
[04:33.050 --> 04:34.110]  the best way to do it.
[04:34.110 --> 04:36.250]  That is my main goal here.
[04:36.250 --> 04:42.090]  Let's focus in on a few of the adjustments that I feel like I need to make for my grow
[04:42.090 --> 04:43.090]  environment.
[04:43.090 --> 04:46.530]  I'm currently going from a warm summer environment here in Colorado.
[04:46.530 --> 04:48.210]  We had 104 degree days.
[04:48.210 --> 04:49.210]  We had 108.
[04:49.210 --> 04:51.330]  There might have been 112 in there.
[04:51.330 --> 04:54.490]  We had some super hot days here over the summer.
[04:54.490 --> 04:58.170]  I have got LED lighting in my main flowering space right now.
[04:58.170 --> 04:59.170]  That's right.
[04:59.170 --> 05:01.570]  I've been using Canon lighting from Black Sale Market.
[05:01.570 --> 05:03.510]  Big shout out to Black Sale Market.
[05:03.510 --> 05:08.210]  Over the summertime and over the springtime, I had great success with the Canon lighting
[05:08.210 --> 05:09.330]  from Black Sale Market.
[05:09.330 --> 05:15.010]  However, I know that in the wintertime, those lights will not keep my grow space warm enough.
[05:15.010 --> 05:19.610]  Those lights are great for when it is hot outside and I don't need warmth in my grow,
[05:19.610 --> 05:21.810]  but it is about to get really cold.
[05:21.810 --> 05:25.210]  I'm going to use my grow lights to heat my grow environment.
[05:25.210 --> 05:30.110]  Also, I'll use my grow lights to heat part of my living space as well.
[05:30.110 --> 05:32.450]  The heat will get ducted into my living area.
[05:32.450 --> 05:36.690]  I will be heating up the grow space with the lights, exhausting that extra heat into my
[05:36.690 --> 05:37.690]  living room.
[05:37.690 --> 05:39.890]  That way, I don't have to turn on the heater as much.
[05:39.890 --> 05:43.930]  I'll try to use that electricity that I'm already running for the grow lights to efficiently
[05:43.930 --> 05:44.930]  heat my house.
[05:44.950 --> 05:47.330]  That's one adjustment I will make.
[05:47.330 --> 05:51.590]  When it gets just a touch cooler, when I have a weekend available, I am going to take down
[05:51.590 --> 05:55.890]  all of my LED lighting and re-hang my HPS lighting.
[05:55.890 --> 06:00.030]  That's right, I will have high-pressure sodium lights for flower over the wintertime.
[06:00.030 --> 06:03.130]  That's one thing that I definitely will change.
[06:03.130 --> 06:05.170]  There's nothing wrong with the Canon lights.
[06:05.170 --> 06:07.210]  Those Canon LEDs are amazing lights.
[06:07.210 --> 06:08.730]  They make beautiful plants.
[06:08.730 --> 06:10.130]  The plants grow with great vigor.
[06:10.450 --> 06:15.450]  In fact, I will leave the Canons in one area in a veg space because that area stays warmer
[06:15.450 --> 06:18.130]  just naturally and where the grow space is.
[06:18.130 --> 06:20.250]  The flowering room does need to get changed.
[06:20.250 --> 06:22.530]  It's up against the exterior wall of the house.
[06:22.530 --> 06:23.890]  It will get much colder there.
[06:23.890 --> 06:26.210]  We're going to swap that out for HPSs.
[06:26.210 --> 06:29.490]  Nothing wrong with the Canons other than they don't make enough heat for the winter.
[06:29.490 --> 06:34.490]  I'm going to hang a light that will make enough heat for the winter and use that gear to my
[06:34.490 --> 06:35.730]  advantage.
[06:35.730 --> 06:38.490]  Why would I put up a heater when I've got HPS lights?
[06:38.490 --> 06:39.650]  I could just throw those right up.
[06:39.650 --> 06:40.650]  That is my theory.
[06:40.650 --> 06:42.930]  If you have a heater, if you want to do it, do that.
[06:42.930 --> 06:45.250]  I'm going to use the HPS lights because I've got them.
[06:45.250 --> 06:49.410]  Then I can duct that heat that comes from those to another room as well, heat up part
[06:49.410 --> 06:50.410]  of the living space.
[06:50.410 --> 06:55.330]  That's the first major adjustment I will make because I will use the HPS lights to heat
[06:55.330 --> 06:57.810]  up part of the house and the grow space.
[06:57.810 --> 07:02.050]  The way my grow is set up, once I change those lights, I will need to change my ducting.
[07:02.050 --> 07:05.090]  That will also change the way I set up my carbon filter.
[07:05.090 --> 07:09.450]  We've caused a chain reaction of things to set up and change in the grow.
[07:09.450 --> 07:10.890]  That's a beautiful process.
[07:10.890 --> 07:15.250]  I think that resetting things up and rebuilding things gives me a good opportunity to clean
[07:15.250 --> 07:18.730]  things that I may not have cleaned, maintenance things that may not have gotten the maintenance
[07:18.730 --> 07:19.770]  they needed.
[07:19.770 --> 07:21.170]  Things are coming off of the ceiling.
[07:21.170 --> 07:22.170]  They'll be down on the floor.
[07:22.170 --> 07:25.050]  I can clean every inch of it before it goes back up.
[07:25.050 --> 07:26.290]  It'll go into summer storage.
[07:26.290 --> 07:27.770]  I'll wrap it up in plastic.
[07:27.770 --> 07:30.850]  I will clean it, then wrap it up into plastic, put it in summer storage.
[07:30.850 --> 07:35.730]  That way next summer when I need it or when the winter, whichever, when I need that gear
[07:35.730 --> 07:36.730]  again, it's clean.
[07:36.730 --> 07:37.730]  It's ready to rock.
[07:37.730 --> 07:38.730]  It's been cleaned up.
[07:39.010 --> 07:41.810]  I'm still polishing it, but now's a good time to clean everything up, give everything a
[07:41.810 --> 07:42.930]  good once over.
[07:42.930 --> 07:47.370]  I will probably repaint the walls while I'm in the process of rebuilding everything, but
[07:47.370 --> 07:52.010]  I will definitely do the different lighting and redo the ducting, which is going to lead
[07:52.010 --> 07:57.930]  me to redoing the exiting of the room where the air, the ducting goes out, which is going
[07:57.930 --> 08:03.010]  to lead to me repainting the entire room, which will probably lead to me redoing the
[08:03.010 --> 08:05.170]  flooring in the entire room.
[08:05.170 --> 08:07.290]  That sounds like a task, but I love it.
[08:07.290 --> 08:09.650]  It's like a trigger for good work to happen.
[08:09.650 --> 08:13.490]  A lot of these things probably needed to be done anyway, so this is a good time to do
[08:13.490 --> 08:14.490]  it.
[08:14.490 --> 08:15.490]  The seasonal change will trigger this.
[08:15.490 --> 08:17.530]  Now, things to think about.
[08:17.530 --> 08:19.930]  I said I'm going to change my ducting.
[08:19.930 --> 08:23.090]  Something to think about is the air that you are bringing into your grow.
[08:23.090 --> 08:24.690]  I don't know where the air is coming in from.
[08:24.690 --> 08:26.050]  I don't know if you've got an air conditioner.
[08:26.050 --> 08:28.650]  I don't know if you have a passive intake, an active intake.
[08:28.650 --> 08:32.910]  If we are bringing frosty cold air into our warm grow environment where we've got grow
[08:32.910 --> 08:37.110]  lights going and it's nice and warm in there, we're bringing basically icicles into the
[08:37.110 --> 08:39.750]  room that creates condensation, moisture.
[08:39.750 --> 08:43.510]  What that really creates is opportunities for powdery mildew.
[08:43.510 --> 08:47.070]  We've already had enough powdery mildew in the warm season, in the spring and summer
[08:47.070 --> 08:48.070]  season.
[08:48.070 --> 08:49.670]  Let's get away from that for the winter.
[08:49.670 --> 08:51.710]  We've got such dry conditions.
[08:51.710 --> 08:55.430]  Let's avoid powdery mildew and use those dry conditions to our advantage.
[08:55.430 --> 08:59.790]  You can bring that outside air into your grow, but let's warm it up before it hits the grow
[08:59.790 --> 09:00.790]  environment.
[09:00.790 --> 09:04.870]  Let's say you want to get into another room, warm it up, then shoot it into your grow space,
[09:04.870 --> 09:05.870]  something like that.
[09:05.870 --> 09:10.750]  But let's not shoot that frosty cold air directly into the grow, directly over the plants.
[09:10.750 --> 09:15.030]  If it's got to go directly into the room, if you don't have any other way to do it,
[09:15.030 --> 09:18.730]  run some ducting to where it goes somewhere else further from the plants, then it warms
[09:18.730 --> 09:22.030]  up a little bit before it actually makes it to the plants.
[09:22.030 --> 09:24.270]  That's a good thing to think about.
[09:24.270 --> 09:27.610]  Is the water which you are feeding these plants, where does the water come from?
[09:27.610 --> 09:29.030]  Is it super cold?
[09:29.030 --> 09:33.390]  If I turn on the water outside in the middle of winter, that water is super cold.
[09:33.390 --> 09:35.790]  I wouldn't want to put that water on my plants.
[09:35.790 --> 09:39.150]  If I get water from one spot in my house, it is super cold.
[09:39.150 --> 09:42.590]  If I get water from the kitchen, it's nice and room temperature.
[09:42.590 --> 09:44.490]  Don't feed your plants really cold water.
[09:44.490 --> 09:45.490]  Think of it like this.
[09:45.490 --> 09:48.350]  If you wouldn't put your feet in there, don't feed it to your plants.
[09:48.350 --> 09:49.510]  Your plants can't walk away.
[09:49.510 --> 09:51.190]  Your plants can't pull their feet out.
[09:51.190 --> 09:52.870]  The plants can't say, ah shit, that's cold.
[09:52.870 --> 09:54.270]  I need to get out of the water.
[09:54.270 --> 09:55.270]  They're stuck there.
[09:55.270 --> 09:56.270]  You're torturing them.
[09:56.270 --> 09:57.270]  Don't do that.
[09:57.270 --> 09:58.730]  Don't feed them super cold water.
[09:59.430 --> 10:00.430]  Get that water warmed up.
[10:00.430 --> 10:05.850]  At least 69, 70 degrees should be ideal for a soilless, soil, cocoa sort of a grow.
[10:05.850 --> 10:08.090]  If you're growing hydro, whole another ball game.
[10:08.090 --> 10:09.090]  Do your thing.
[10:09.090 --> 10:11.690]  You guys like to adjust your temperatures accordingly to avoid the mildew.
[10:11.690 --> 10:13.370]  I'm not an expert in that area.
[10:13.370 --> 10:19.130]  I'm talking about something with soil, soilless mix, cocoa, something like that.
[10:19.130 --> 10:20.410]  Don't feed too cold of water.
[10:20.410 --> 10:21.570]  It will shock your roots.
[10:21.570 --> 10:24.710]  Be cool with that, especially if it gets real cold outside.
[10:24.710 --> 10:29.710]  Another thing that people often overlook when it gets cold, how cold is the floor in
[10:29.710 --> 10:30.710]  your grow space?
[10:30.710 --> 10:33.910]  I talked a minute ago about putting cold water on your feet.
[10:33.910 --> 10:37.950]  Can you walk around in the grow space barefoot and your feet not be too cold?
[10:37.950 --> 10:41.350]  It's not a good idea to walk around the grow space barefoot.
[10:41.350 --> 10:42.350]  Let's talk about why.
[10:42.350 --> 10:46.230]  I've got one solid reason why I think it's not a good idea to walk around the grow space
[10:46.230 --> 10:47.230]  barefoot.
[10:47.230 --> 10:49.350]  If, and when we apply pesticides.
[10:49.350 --> 10:52.390]  I apply pesticides on a routine basis in my garden.
[10:52.390 --> 10:54.030]  I apply spray pesticides.
[10:54.350 --> 10:58.390]  I also spray foliar feeds, which we may talk about more on this episode.
[10:58.390 --> 11:00.350]  I apply a lot of things to that grow.
[11:00.350 --> 11:01.630]  I feed the plants.
[11:01.630 --> 11:04.190]  A lot of shit ends up on that floor.
[11:04.190 --> 11:06.870]  Pesticides, grow nutrients, a lot of stuff is on that floor.
[11:06.870 --> 11:08.350]  I do my best to keep it clean.
[11:08.350 --> 11:09.350]  I mop it.
[11:09.350 --> 11:10.350]  I clean it.
[11:10.350 --> 11:12.590]  I sweep it, but there is stuff on that floor.
[11:12.590 --> 11:17.150]  You shouldn't be in there barefoot because the bottoms of your feet are part of the,
[11:17.150 --> 11:21.510]  one of the most absorbent parts of your body for chemicals, toxins, contaminants.
[11:21.510 --> 11:25.070]  You can suck up pesticides through the bottoms of your feet quite quickly.
[11:25.070 --> 11:27.870]  So technically maybe you shouldn't be in there barefoot.
[11:27.870 --> 11:29.670]  Also protect your toes.
[11:29.670 --> 11:31.950]  What kind of hippie are you in there barefoot anyway?
[11:31.950 --> 11:35.710]  If that's your style, be that way bro, but it's risky.
[11:35.710 --> 11:36.710]  It's dangerous.
[11:36.710 --> 11:39.470]  So walk around, see if the floor is cold.
[11:39.470 --> 11:40.470]  That's the main point.
[11:40.470 --> 11:41.470]  Is it cold on your feet?
[11:41.470 --> 11:45.030]  If it's cold on your feet, get the plants up off of the floor.
[11:45.030 --> 11:48.390]  It's okay to have a cold grow room floor, but raise the plants up off of it.
[11:48.390 --> 11:50.070]  Maybe just put them on a cinder block.
[11:50.510 --> 11:54.510]  A very affordable way to get the plants up off the floor is to flip another pot upside
[11:54.510 --> 11:58.470]  down and set the pot right on that pot.
[11:58.470 --> 12:00.710]  Just you got one upside down, another pot on another pot.
[12:00.710 --> 12:04.350]  Now you're that pot height, taller and off the ground.
[12:04.350 --> 12:06.950]  Sometimes that's not the best because it gets you too close to the light.
[12:06.950 --> 12:10.270]  Sometimes if I got a plant that's not growing tall enough, that's how I get the fucker closer
[12:10.270 --> 12:13.030]  to the light and adjust that plant to match the rest of the canopy.
[12:13.030 --> 12:17.950]  But get them up off the floor, flip a pot upside down, use some cinder blocks, build
[12:17.950 --> 12:22.790]  a table, get those plants off the floor because it is probably quite cold.
[12:22.790 --> 12:24.110]  So think about the air coming in.
[12:24.110 --> 12:28.510]  Think about the cold water and think about that cold intake.
[12:28.510 --> 12:30.230]  Cold floor, cold water, cold intake.
[12:30.230 --> 12:33.310]  It is all going to happen very soon.
[12:33.310 --> 12:35.150]  We don't want to freeze out these plants.
[12:35.150 --> 12:39.950]  Try to use that cold air to your advantage, but don't blast the plants.
[12:39.950 --> 12:41.430]  Don't cause any frostbite.
[12:41.430 --> 12:42.830]  Set yourself up for success.
[12:42.830 --> 12:45.390]  You guys, this time of the year is coming.
[12:45.390 --> 12:48.150]  Maybe time to turn off some things, turn on some other things.
[12:48.150 --> 12:50.110]  I don't know your full grow environment.
[12:50.110 --> 12:51.510]  I don't have your pulse monitor.
[12:51.510 --> 12:54.590]  I don't know what your minder unit is telling you.
[12:54.590 --> 12:59.230]  Pay attention to that and make the adjustments, but I'm giving you a heads up the best I can.
[12:59.230 --> 13:03.470]  Now is the time to start thinking about the equipment for the seasonal changes.
[13:03.470 --> 13:05.330]  Set yourself up for success.
[13:05.330 --> 13:09.350]  Don't say, I can go buy that in two weeks because everybody's going to go to the grow
[13:09.350 --> 13:13.210]  store and buy that in two weeks and it's going to be gone, sold out, especially during these
[13:13.210 --> 13:14.210]  weird times.
[13:14.210 --> 13:18.050]  It's going to take a really long time for shit to get replenished, reshipped and restocked.
[13:18.050 --> 13:19.050]  Get ahead of the game.
[13:19.050 --> 13:21.810]  Go get that shit now, especially if it's in the budget.
[13:21.810 --> 13:24.030]  If it's in the budget, why are you fucking around?
[13:24.030 --> 13:25.450]  Go get it.
[13:25.450 --> 13:29.030]  Go get it before it goes in demand because once it goes in high demand, they'll raise
[13:29.030 --> 13:30.030]  the price on you.
[13:30.030 --> 13:32.390]  It's not going to go on sale when people need more of it.
[13:32.390 --> 13:34.390]  That is not the way this industry works.
[13:34.390 --> 13:36.090]  Come on, go get the shit you need now.
[13:36.090 --> 13:37.350]  Be prepared.
[13:37.350 --> 13:39.630]  Do all of the shit today that you can do today.
[13:39.630 --> 13:43.050]  If there is work that can happen in the grow room, this is a side ranch.
[13:43.050 --> 13:46.550]  This is just some Rasta Jeff advice here.
[13:46.550 --> 13:51.710]  If there is work that can be done in the grow room today or tomorrow and you've got time,
[13:51.710 --> 13:57.450]  energy, equipment and electricity still to do it, if the lights are on and if you're
[13:57.450 --> 14:00.650]  not getting too much overtime and the boss isn't going to get on your ass, get in there
[14:00.650 --> 14:06.070]  and do that stuff because tomorrow there's going to be more shit to do.
[14:06.070 --> 14:08.630]  There may be some new shit to do that you didn't know.
[14:09.630 --> 14:11.250]  in a commercial environment.
[14:11.250 --> 14:15.210]  You guys, I am very experienced in working in large commercial grows.
[14:15.210 --> 14:19.050]  The thing I train people when I teach them how to operate in a new grow, I say the first
[14:19.050 --> 14:24.170]  thing we do is we walk in and we find out what went wrong last night because in a hundred
[14:24.170 --> 14:27.930]  flowering light environment, you've got a hundred flowering lights, somewhere between
[14:27.930 --> 14:30.050]  30 and 60 vegetative lights.
[14:30.050 --> 14:37.010]  You've got clones, clone trays, hydro pumps, fans, air conditioners, CO2 machines, computers,
[14:37.010 --> 14:38.490]  all kinds of shit in a big facility.
[14:38.510 --> 14:43.730]  The first thing we need to do when we walk in is find out what went wrong last night.
[14:43.730 --> 14:47.210]  So if there's some stuff that you can get done today, go ahead and do that stuff because
[14:47.210 --> 14:50.730]  I don't know what your surprises are going to be tomorrow.
[14:50.730 --> 14:52.950]  You could have a five minute surprise.
[14:52.950 --> 14:56.490]  You could, and I hope this doesn't happen, you could kick over a bucket, take you 15,
[14:56.490 --> 14:58.170]  20 minutes to mop that bucket up.
[14:58.170 --> 15:01.550]  You got to go smoke a dab, get your shit back together and regroup.
[15:01.550 --> 15:05.230]  Maybe that's a 30 minute fucking waste of your day that you didn't see coming or maybe
[15:05.230 --> 15:09.590]  just maybe, I don't even want to jinx you, maybe something catastrophic goes wrong in
[15:09.590 --> 15:12.030]  the grove and you don't get any of your side work done.
[15:12.030 --> 15:14.190]  You don't get any of your main work done.
[15:14.190 --> 15:18.550]  Now your side work, main work and tomorrow's work is already fucked up.
[15:18.550 --> 15:19.830]  Set yourself up for success.
[15:19.830 --> 15:22.030]  Get as much done today as you can.
[15:22.030 --> 15:25.750]  I understand we've got families, we've got kids, we've got dogs we want to run around
[15:25.750 --> 15:26.750]  with.
[15:26.750 --> 15:28.110]  We've got reggae shows we want to go see.
[15:28.110 --> 15:32.630]  You guys, I saw the most amazing reggae show tonight, today, earlier today.
[15:32.630 --> 15:33.630]  It was so good.
[15:33.630 --> 15:34.630]  It was tonight.
[15:34.630 --> 15:36.150]  I don't know what I'm recording but the vibes were high.
[15:36.150 --> 15:37.790]  I had to do something.
[15:37.790 --> 15:41.990]  We got stuff we want to do in our lives but try to knock out those garden chores.
[15:41.990 --> 15:44.590]  If you've got a small grove, it really can't take that long.
[15:44.590 --> 15:47.710]  If you've got a big grove, then you asked for it.
[15:47.710 --> 15:48.710]  Get in there and do the work.
[15:48.710 --> 15:49.870]  I know what my job is.
[15:49.870 --> 15:51.470]  I know how long it should take.
[15:51.470 --> 15:56.670]  I know how much to allow myself and I also know that shit happens, surprises come up,
[15:56.670 --> 15:58.470]  things go wrong.
[15:58.470 --> 15:59.470]  It's Murphy's Law.
[15:59.470 --> 16:02.610]  What can go wrong fucking will and be prepared for that.
[16:02.610 --> 16:07.770]  That's how you react, respond and adjust to those things that make you a good grower.
[16:07.770 --> 16:11.450]  But if you're prepared, those things are much easier to deal with.
[16:11.450 --> 16:12.610]  All right, I'm fucking rambling.
[16:12.610 --> 16:13.810]  Set yourself up for success.
[16:13.810 --> 16:15.570]  You guys, that's the bottom line here.
[16:15.570 --> 16:16.810]  I want you to succeed.
[16:16.810 --> 16:21.010]  As much as you want to be successful, I really want you to be successful.
[16:21.010 --> 16:26.490]  I don't want you to go buy all this gear, set up all this stuff, send me money on Patreon,
[16:26.490 --> 16:30.010]  buy expensive seeds and then not have a fruitful harvest.
[16:30.010 --> 16:33.130]  That's going to make me feel bad, especially if you bought my seeds and listened to my
[16:33.130 --> 16:35.010]  show and still didn't succeed.
[16:35.010 --> 16:37.450]  I feel like I kind of guided you and you didn't get there.
[16:37.450 --> 16:39.410]  So I want us to get there together.
[16:39.410 --> 16:42.650]  I want you to feel that pride that I feel when I harvest some plants.
[16:42.650 --> 16:44.330]  All right, stoned and rambling.
[16:44.330 --> 16:47.610]  I'm telling you the reggae vibes are high tonight.
[16:47.610 --> 16:49.970]  I do have a Patreon question here in front of me.
[16:49.970 --> 16:52.350]  Let's get this one Patreon question going.
[16:52.350 --> 16:54.730]  This one came from my buddy, Sintzy Nasty.
[16:54.730 --> 16:55.730]  What's up, bro?
[16:55.730 --> 16:56.730]  Thank you for the great message.
[16:56.730 --> 16:58.690]  I send you a lot of great stuff on Patreon.
[16:58.690 --> 17:02.610]  And finally, one of them has made it to the podcast.
[17:02.610 --> 17:05.610]  This one from my buddy Sintzy goes a lot like this.
[17:05.610 --> 17:08.850]  It says, your silver thiosulfate blend is working.
[17:08.850 --> 17:09.850]  Bland?
[17:09.850 --> 17:10.850]  I said bland.
[17:10.850 --> 17:11.850]  It doesn't say bland here.
[17:11.850 --> 17:12.850]  It says, let me try it in this camera.
[17:12.850 --> 17:14.370]  Maybe this camera will get it right.
[17:14.370 --> 17:20.050]  Your silver thiosulfate blend is working amazingly on my auto flower project.
[17:20.050 --> 17:24.850]  So a few episodes back, quite a few episodes back, I gave an explanation on how to make
[17:25.010 --> 17:30.250]  silver thiosulfate to use for reversing plants to make feminized seeds.
[17:30.250 --> 17:36.290]  Our friend Sintzy Nasty here has used my recipe to make some auto flower feminized seeds,
[17:36.290 --> 17:37.290]  which is a great thing.
[17:37.290 --> 17:40.770]  I don't make auto flower, so I'm glad somebody else is out there doing it.
[17:40.770 --> 17:45.570]  It said, I have followed your instructions to a T and I'm getting a pretty decent amount
[17:45.570 --> 17:46.570]  of pollen.
[17:46.570 --> 17:50.490]  That is great to hear because sometimes the recipe will take some adjustment.
[17:50.490 --> 17:54.650]  The first time you make that mix, it might not be strong enough to reverse the plant.
[17:55.450 --> 17:57.250]  It might be so strong it burns the plant.
[17:57.250 --> 18:01.130]  The spray schedule may need to be more frequently, less frequently.
[18:01.130 --> 18:02.130]  It might burn.
[18:02.130 --> 18:03.170]  It might not do anything to the plant.
[18:03.170 --> 18:07.570]  There are adjustments to be made per plant here, so I'm glad that it worked for you on
[18:07.570 --> 18:09.210]  the first try.
[18:09.210 --> 18:11.970]  That gives me confidence that my mixture is working.
[18:11.970 --> 18:14.890]  It's very universal, versatile, and it worked on your stuff.
[18:14.890 --> 18:15.890]  That feels good.
[18:15.890 --> 18:17.850]  So it says, big up for sharing that.
[18:17.850 --> 18:22.850]  It saved us a ton of money and I'm not even close to using up the first batch.
[18:22.850 --> 18:28.570]  Yes, silver thiosulfate, or at least the components to make such, are very affordable.
[18:28.570 --> 18:32.330]  When I see people selling products to reverse plants and I see companies selling silver
[18:32.330 --> 18:37.570]  thiosulfate for exorbitant amounts, it drives me a little bit crazy because you can make
[18:37.570 --> 18:41.050]  hundreds of gallons for like 30 bucks.
[18:41.050 --> 18:43.050]  Hundreds of gallons for maybe 30 bucks.
[18:43.050 --> 18:45.970]  Most of that 30 is probably going to be shipping.
[18:45.970 --> 18:50.610]  The two products you need are very affordable, 10 bucks per bottle, 10 bucks for shipping,
[18:50.610 --> 18:55.410]  and then you need a gallon of distilled water every time you do it, and that'll make enough
[18:55.410 --> 18:56.730]  to reverse a plant.
[18:56.730 --> 18:57.730]  You got it covered.
[18:57.730 --> 18:59.930]  That's really affordable in my opinion.
[18:59.930 --> 19:02.970]  So when I see the people charging too much, it drives me crazy.
[19:02.970 --> 19:04.010]  That's just price gouging.
[19:04.010 --> 19:06.330]  That's stabbing at the community.
[19:06.330 --> 19:07.330]  That shouldn't be a thing.
[19:07.330 --> 19:09.490]  We should be able to have access to the products which we need.
[19:09.490 --> 19:10.490]  So there you go.
[19:10.490 --> 19:13.290]  Make your own silver thiosulfate, much more cost effective.
[19:13.290 --> 19:14.290]  There is more.
[19:14.290 --> 19:18.290]  It says, this is kind of a breeding and market question.
[19:18.290 --> 19:20.690]  This is sort of a sales question, a business question.
[19:20.690 --> 19:21.690]  I really do like this.
[19:21.690 --> 19:24.250]  I'm a great person to ask this, I would say.
[19:24.250 --> 19:31.090]  It says, knowing that the market is driving femme and auto flower seeds, as a breeder trying
[19:31.090 --> 19:36.730]  to serve the market, does it make sense to search for elite females more than trying
[19:36.730 --> 19:38.650]  out different males?
[19:38.650 --> 19:42.730]  So there's a couple things to talk about in that one sentence there, in that one statement.
[19:42.730 --> 19:45.890]  Knowing that the market is driving on femmes and autos.
[19:46.570 --> 19:49.450]  The market loves feminized seeds.
[19:49.450 --> 19:52.890]  More than half of what I sell would be femme seeds if I could make more femmes.
[19:52.890 --> 19:55.010]  I can't keep up, I don't make enough femmes.
[19:55.010 --> 19:56.570]  I make a lot of regular seeds.
[19:56.570 --> 19:58.410]  We're going to talk about that in a minute.
[19:58.410 --> 19:59.410]  They're honestly easier.
[19:59.410 --> 20:01.050]  You get more pollen from a regular plant.
[20:01.050 --> 20:02.690]  You don't have to reverse it.
[20:02.690 --> 20:03.690]  Reversing is science.
[20:03.690 --> 20:04.690]  You have to learn each plant.
[20:04.690 --> 20:08.690]  It takes a little more effort, time, energy, space, work.
[20:08.690 --> 20:11.210]  So the market is after femmes and autos.
[20:11.210 --> 20:12.210]  That is very true.
[20:12.210 --> 20:16.570]  There are a lot of people who will not grow feminized seeds.
[20:16.570 --> 20:19.970]  There are a lot of people who will not grow auto flower seeds.
[20:19.970 --> 20:23.970]  There are large portions of the cannabis community who are opposed to both of those.
[20:23.970 --> 20:25.730]  I'm not bashing those products.
[20:25.730 --> 20:32.290]  I have nothing against auto flowers, especially against feminized seeds, but a lot of people
[20:32.290 --> 20:34.450]  will not grow them.
[20:34.450 --> 20:39.690]  A lot of people feel that feminized seeds are doing something wrong to the gene pool.
[20:39.690 --> 20:43.130]  A lot of people just simply won't grow those seeds.
[20:43.130 --> 20:45.610]  I was going to talk about a certain group and why, but we don't need to go down that
[20:45.610 --> 20:46.610]  path today.
[20:46.610 --> 20:48.130]  Let's keep me a little bit focused.
[20:48.130 --> 20:49.610]  A lot of people do want the reg seeds.
[20:49.610 --> 20:50.730]  A lot of people want the femmes.
[20:50.730 --> 20:52.130]  A lot of people want the auto flowers.
[20:52.130 --> 20:55.090]  I see that there's a market for all of that.
[20:55.090 --> 20:56.090]  Let me follow up.
[20:56.090 --> 20:58.850]  It says, as a breeder trying to serve the market, does it make more sense to search
[20:58.850 --> 21:02.570]  for elite females more than trying out different males?
[21:02.570 --> 21:03.690]  You have to do both.
[21:03.690 --> 21:10.850]  As a breeder who wants to be relevant in the market, that wants to be on top of the
[21:10.850 --> 21:13.730]  market, that wants customers, you have to do both.
[21:13.730 --> 21:16.570]  You have to have a solid male plant at least.
[21:16.570 --> 21:19.650]  The male plant is what sets you apart.
[21:19.650 --> 21:21.610]  Everybody's got the females.
[21:21.610 --> 21:22.690]  Everybody's growing the females.
[21:22.690 --> 21:25.450]  The entire community is growing the females.
[21:25.450 --> 21:27.930]  We see those in large numbers.
[21:27.930 --> 21:34.650]  It's the breeders who are seeking out the elite males that do the work to make new things.
[21:34.650 --> 21:35.650]  We've got to find both.
[21:35.650 --> 21:40.330]  We've got to find the males that will contribute to the gene pool and move the cannabis plants
[21:40.330 --> 21:42.450]  forward for our purpose.
[21:42.450 --> 21:47.490]  Whether my purpose is usually producing high yielding plants with a lot of turps and very
[21:47.490 --> 21:49.170]  high THC potency.
[21:49.170 --> 21:50.370]  That is my thing.
[21:50.370 --> 21:52.170]  That's because that's what I enjoy.
[21:52.170 --> 21:56.770]  I feel like since I make a product that I enjoy, I am successful because I'm doing it
[21:57.010 --> 22:00.050]  with my heart, for myself, and other people like it.
[22:00.050 --> 22:01.770]  It's like a good musician.
[22:01.770 --> 22:06.610]  If your favorite musician wrote songs for some girl, those songs are going to suck.
[22:06.610 --> 22:10.130]  But if your favorite musician writes songs for themselves, they're going to be great
[22:10.130 --> 22:12.930]  songs and that girl will love it and so will you.
[22:12.930 --> 22:14.490]  I think that's why my brand works.
[22:14.490 --> 22:19.130]  I make a product that I feel is up to my standards, up to what I like.
[22:19.130 --> 22:23.650]  You guys happen to like it also because I've got high standards and I know what people
[22:23.770 --> 22:28.690]  want, what to expect, and what to look for in quality cannabis.
[22:28.690 --> 22:30.570]  A lot of it is finding that male.
[22:30.570 --> 22:31.970]  A lot of it is finding the boy.
[22:31.970 --> 22:34.210]  A lot of my company is based on King Solomon.
[22:34.210 --> 22:36.730]  You mentioned Solomon later in this message.
[22:36.730 --> 22:37.730]  Solomon is the stud.
[22:37.730 --> 22:40.850]  It took me a lot of searching, a lot of hunting to find Solomon.
[22:40.850 --> 22:45.290]  First I had to find the plant that fit the criteria which I was looking for.
[22:45.290 --> 22:46.290]  I had a list.
[22:46.290 --> 22:47.850]  I'm kind of an OCD guy.
[22:47.850 --> 22:49.170]  I write lists on paper.
[22:49.170 --> 22:51.050]  It had to have all of these traits.
[22:51.090 --> 22:53.970]  I found a few plants with all of those traits.
[22:53.970 --> 22:54.970]  We bred with them.
[22:54.970 --> 22:58.690]  Then we grew out those seeds and we had to see what that male plant was doing to the
[22:58.690 --> 22:59.690]  seeds.
[22:59.690 --> 23:01.130]  So that's how I found Solomon.
[23:01.130 --> 23:02.890]  That's why Solomon stands out.
[23:02.890 --> 23:06.290]  That's why my company stands out because of that elite male.
[23:06.290 --> 23:10.330]  Now the other half of the equation, you do have to have those elite females.
[23:10.330 --> 23:13.950]  Having a stud and a bunch of half-assed females to breed with won't do it.
[23:13.950 --> 23:16.770]  You have to make solid female selections.
[23:16.770 --> 23:20.250]  Now I said before, the entire community has got females.
[23:20.250 --> 23:22.650]  They're all female hunting female plants.
[23:22.650 --> 23:26.330]  So we've got the beautiful advantage of I can grow the plants and I can find my own
[23:26.330 --> 23:31.450]  females or we've got a squad of people out there buying seeds, getting free seeds, growing
[23:31.450 --> 23:36.810]  seeds, trading seeds, and they find good keepers and somehow they end up back in my garden
[23:36.810 --> 23:40.410]  and I can breed with those elite females as well.
[23:40.410 --> 23:45.690]  So the question is, does it make sense to search for elite females more than trying
[23:45.690 --> 23:47.130]  out different males?
[23:47.170 --> 23:52.410]  As a breeder who makes a lot of regular seeds, I need to have solid males in my garden and
[23:52.410 --> 23:56.450]  I have to have a revolving stable of quality females.
[23:56.450 --> 23:57.810]  I try to keep a couple.
[23:57.810 --> 23:59.370]  I'm limited on numbers.
[23:59.370 --> 24:04.090]  So I keep a percentage of my numbers for a male plant, a percentage for solid keeper
[24:04.090 --> 24:08.170]  females and then a percentage of my numbers go for rotating plants, something that's going
[24:08.170 --> 24:09.170]  to come and go.
[24:09.170 --> 24:13.010]  Like I usually have a list of this many and when I get a new plant, I go, where does it
[24:13.010 --> 24:14.010]  fit in the list?
[24:14.010 --> 24:15.010]  Who's got to go?
[24:15.010 --> 24:17.850]  And then at the bottom of the list, that plant gets kicked out and the new ones come
[24:17.850 --> 24:18.850]  in.
[24:18.850 --> 24:25.490]  So if I were to only make feminized seeds, then I wouldn't even worry about boys and
[24:25.490 --> 24:30.010]  we would be searching for the best females all the time and I would just breed stuff
[24:30.010 --> 24:34.570]  and find, I would grow it first, which I normally do, and I would find the winners out of there
[24:34.570 --> 24:37.210]  and then I would send out the seeds and let you guys grow it next.
[24:37.210 --> 24:41.010]  But I would be one or two steps ahead of you breeding with the new shit that you don't
[24:41.010 --> 24:45.010]  have yet so that I'm ahead of everybody just a couple of steps, which is honestly kind
[24:45.010 --> 24:47.450]  of what I do with my own line anyway.
[24:47.450 --> 24:50.950]  But if I were only to make fems, yeah, we would be searching out a bunch of bad ass
[24:50.950 --> 24:54.370]  females and then just breed each female to every female.
[24:54.370 --> 24:59.050]  If I had a list of six girls, I take number one and pollinate everybody else with it.
[24:59.050 --> 25:02.930]  And then we take number two and pollinate everybody else and take number three, pollinate
[25:02.930 --> 25:03.930]  everybody else.
[25:03.930 --> 25:08.170]  Just reverse that plant, pollinate everybody with it is what we would have to do.
[25:08.170 --> 25:09.930]  But I like making reg seeds.
[25:09.930 --> 25:12.170]  I really like, I like breeding.
[25:12.170 --> 25:16.290]  I like watching what the boy does to the plants, to the mix, to the recipe.
[25:16.290 --> 25:17.810]  I kind of like that part.
[25:17.810 --> 25:19.250]  So I like the boys in the mix.
[25:19.250 --> 25:24.130]  I love feminized seeds also, but there's just something about a male female cross being
[25:24.130 --> 25:29.210]  a breeder, being somebody who's deeply curious and passionate about genetics and breeding.
[25:29.210 --> 25:31.130]  That boy plant means a lot to me.
[25:31.130 --> 25:33.010]  So you have to have both.
[25:33.010 --> 25:36.170]  The males are what separate us from each other.
[25:36.170 --> 25:37.890]  Our male is kind of like our style.
[25:37.890 --> 25:38.890]  It's like our calling card.
[25:38.890 --> 25:39.890]  It's our flavor.
[25:39.890 --> 25:43.370]  It's our, it's our catchphrase or whatever you want to say.
[25:43.370 --> 25:46.370]  It's what, yeah, that's the male is what does it.
[25:46.370 --> 25:50.970]  And one male can do a lot of work just like a reversed female can do a lot of work.
[25:50.970 --> 25:55.210]  But if you've got nine females in the room, pollinate all nine of those females from that
[25:55.210 --> 25:59.170]  one male and make nine crosses from one dude.
[25:59.170 --> 26:00.570]  Sometimes that's how I do it with King Solomon.
[26:00.570 --> 26:05.250]  I'll put him in the room with just the whole stable of ladies and let him go buck wild.
[26:05.250 --> 26:09.570]  He may be in a greenhouse right now getting frisky with like 12 beautiful ladies.
[26:09.570 --> 26:11.610]  So he's got a hot, hot fucking weekend.
[26:11.610 --> 26:15.210]  All right, let me keep moving cause I am kind of rambly.
[26:15.210 --> 26:17.970]  Where are we?
[26:17.970 --> 26:18.970]  It goes on.
[26:18.970 --> 26:19.970]  I have to find my place.
[26:19.970 --> 26:23.690]  Furthermore, it says, furthermore, knowing that the market doesn't want male plants or
[26:23.690 --> 26:28.850]  most of the market, would it make sense for breeders to start charging more, not less
[26:28.850 --> 26:32.210]  for regular seed production?
[26:32.210 --> 26:33.210]  It is common.
[26:33.210 --> 26:34.210]  I said common.
[26:34.210 --> 26:36.450]  I'm going to put the bunch of C's across the screen again.
[26:36.450 --> 26:42.570]  It is common that a feminized seeds are usually double the price of regular seeds.
[26:42.570 --> 26:46.770]  If you look at my website, if you look at most of my seed vendors, a regular pack of
[26:46.770 --> 26:48.770]  seeds is 80 bucks.
[26:48.770 --> 26:52.010]  A feminized pack of seeds is 80 bucks.
[26:52.010 --> 26:54.170]  In the regular seeds, it's a 10 pack.
[26:54.170 --> 26:56.490]  In the fem seeds, it's a six pack.
[26:56.490 --> 26:59.210]  They're almost double the price.
[26:59.210 --> 27:05.210]  So that is because I said earlier, it takes more work, much more work in my opinion and
[27:05.210 --> 27:08.150]  in my experience to make a feminized seed.
[27:08.150 --> 27:11.710]  You've got to treat that donor, the pollen donor plant.
[27:11.710 --> 27:12.710]  You've got to treat it.
[27:12.710 --> 27:16.890]  It's got to be treated with a specific way for about three or four weeks before you're
[27:16.890 --> 27:20.050]  going to make it a plant that will give you pollen.
[27:20.050 --> 27:24.250]  Then once it does reverse, sometimes they don't make very much pollen.
[27:24.250 --> 27:28.130]  Depending on how your recipe was, you've got to adjust the recipe, perfect that, dial that
[27:28.130 --> 27:29.130]  in.
[27:29.130 --> 27:32.410]  If you didn't get it right, you may have just done a full run and not produced enough pollen.
[27:32.410 --> 27:36.290]  You got a bunch of buds with very minimal seeds, kind of wasted a whole run there.
[27:36.290 --> 27:37.890]  So you got to dial it in.
[27:37.890 --> 27:39.050]  You got to get it right.
[27:39.050 --> 27:44.730]  That's why fem seeds are more expensive and regular seeds are generally half the price.
[27:44.730 --> 27:50.850]  And then on top of that, regular seeds are one price, fem seeds are double and then auto
[27:50.850 --> 27:53.610]  flower fem seeds are double that price.
[27:53.610 --> 27:56.890]  So you're paying a lot more for your auto flowers.
[27:56.890 --> 27:58.810]  Let me keep reading because there is more to this.
[27:58.810 --> 28:01.850]  It says, it is an interesting thing to think about that.
[28:01.850 --> 28:05.130]  I see how much your discord server loves King Solomon.
[28:05.130 --> 28:06.730]  Clearly he is a beast.
[28:06.730 --> 28:07.730]  Yes.
[28:07.730 --> 28:12.130]  With King Solomon in the stable, it does make it hard to do any other work.
[28:12.130 --> 28:13.690]  Like I just want to work with Solomon.
[28:13.690 --> 28:19.130]  Why not put Solomon pollen on every female cannabis plant in the world?
[28:19.130 --> 28:20.230]  Solomon is a stud.
[28:20.230 --> 28:22.530]  Everything he touches turns to fucking gold.
[28:22.530 --> 28:23.530]  It's amazing.
[28:23.530 --> 28:25.770]  So it makes it hard to do other projects.
[28:25.770 --> 28:28.770]  I did find a Jack the Ripper male that does amazing work.
[28:28.770 --> 28:32.490]  So I've been playing with him and you know, I do love to cross a few, a reverse a few
[28:32.490 --> 28:36.570]  of those females I've got, but yes, Solomon is a beast.
[28:36.570 --> 28:37.570]  He's a true stud.
[28:37.570 --> 28:38.570]  He's a winner.
[28:38.570 --> 28:42.730]  Um, it's, I put a lot of work, dedication, time, energy, and effort into finding that
[28:42.730 --> 28:43.730]  dude.
[28:43.730 --> 28:44.730]  So I'm glad it paid off.
[28:44.730 --> 28:45.970]  Uh, had to name him Solomon.
[28:45.970 --> 28:49.610]  If you understand anything about Solomon and why he's named Solomon big up, maybe you'll
[28:49.610 --> 28:50.610]  do some research.
[28:50.610 --> 28:52.730]  Now there's a reason for that name.
[28:52.730 --> 28:53.730]  Then it says, what do you think?
[28:53.730 --> 28:55.530]  Uh, man, I gave a lot of insight.
[28:55.570 --> 28:57.170]  I hope you know what I think by now.
[28:57.170 --> 29:02.810]  Then it says, lastly, I think you should redo and rerelease a lot of your early grow instructions.
[29:02.810 --> 29:07.850]  There are a bunch of new people and way more podcast competition than he mentions is mentions.
[29:07.850 --> 29:11.650]  I said mentions is he mentions some of my podcast competition.
[29:11.650 --> 29:12.650]  Let me say this.
[29:12.650 --> 29:15.290]  I don't feel that anybody out there podcasting is competition.
[29:15.290 --> 29:16.290]  We're all friends.
[29:16.290 --> 29:17.290]  We're all bros.
[29:17.290 --> 29:18.290]  We're all doing the same thing.
[29:18.290 --> 29:19.570]  We've got the same exact goal.
[29:19.570 --> 29:23.170]  Our goal is to make you a better grower, to give you better knowledge, to make you more
[29:23.170 --> 29:25.970]  comfortable in the grow room, more comfortable with your plants.
[29:25.970 --> 29:28.330]  I don't feel it a competitive, any competition.
[29:28.330 --> 29:31.050]  I see that word, um, twice in this sentence here.
[29:31.050 --> 29:33.170]  So, uh, no competition, dude.
[29:33.170 --> 29:34.170]  It's all love.
[29:34.170 --> 29:35.170]  It's all respect.
[29:35.170 --> 29:37.610]  But yes, there are so many more podcasts out there.
[29:37.610 --> 29:42.890]  Um, and now let's revisit the point of that sentence, redoing and rereleasing a lot of
[29:42.890 --> 29:44.290]  the old episodes.
[29:44.290 --> 29:45.570]  I would love to do that.
[29:45.570 --> 29:51.170]  I will work on doing that, but I get so many messages and questions that redoing stuff,
[29:51.170 --> 29:55.650]  uh, sometimes is, uh, it's on the back burner, uh, keeping up with the current content, the
[29:55.650 --> 29:57.250]  current questions that is important.
[29:57.250 --> 29:59.410]  Staying on top of the Patreon questions.
[29:59.410 --> 30:01.730]  Those people do pay me to answer their questions.
[30:01.730 --> 30:02.930]  I feel like that is priority.
[30:02.930 --> 30:06.250]  I always print out the Patreon questions, bang those out first.
[30:06.250 --> 30:10.050]  Then I work my way to older questions, stuff that's just on my mind that I want to ramble
[30:10.050 --> 30:11.650]  about stuff like that.
[30:11.650 --> 30:15.530]  So, um, I will redo those episodes over time.
[30:15.530 --> 30:17.330]  I did the cloning episode.
[30:17.330 --> 30:19.630]  I did the bottom and lollipopping episode.
[30:19.630 --> 30:22.150]  Those were just kind of redos of episodes as well.
[30:22.150 --> 30:24.910]  Another thing you can do if you don't want to wait for the redo is you can always go
[30:24.910 --> 30:26.710]  back and listen to the old episodes.
[30:26.710 --> 30:30.550]  If you're an old listener, a new listener, if you've just discovered the podcast, please
[30:30.550 --> 30:33.950]  do feel free to dive into the old catalog of episodes.
[30:33.950 --> 30:35.430]  There's a lot of great knowledge.
[30:35.430 --> 30:40.830]  Uh, go check out the way that the podcast has changed, uh, just grown over time.
[30:40.830 --> 30:41.870]  First it was really scripted.
[30:41.870 --> 30:45.990]  I wrote down most of what I was going to say was on paper and I would just read it and
[30:45.990 --> 30:47.270]  just fucking do the show like that.
[30:47.270 --> 30:49.750]  And then it got more comfortable and then I hit my head.
[30:49.750 --> 30:53.230]  There's a chunk of episodes where I've got, I'm recovering and dealing with a traumatic
[30:53.230 --> 30:55.390]  brain injury and a lot of weirdness.
[30:55.390 --> 30:57.510]  Those episodes are really interesting to listen to.
[30:57.510 --> 30:59.750]  Uh, and then just over time things change.
[30:59.750 --> 31:04.350]  And then we had a pandemic which taught me a lot about podcasting and that's when I went
[31:04.350 --> 31:05.350]  to video.
[31:05.350 --> 31:06.530]  So go listen to the old stuff.
[31:06.530 --> 31:07.530]  That's what I'm saying.
[31:07.530 --> 31:10.590]  A lot of the lessons you're looking for, a lot of questions you guys might have maybe
[31:10.590 --> 31:14.790]  hidden in those old episodes and I will over time redo them.
[31:14.790 --> 31:18.110]  I'm slowly, they're slowly organically re happening.
[31:18.110 --> 31:20.030]  The winter stuff I just talked about.
[31:20.030 --> 31:23.630]  I'm sure I've said a lot of that in an old episode before.
[31:23.630 --> 31:26.310]  So a lot of it will get repeated, recycled.
[31:26.310 --> 31:29.990]  I felt kind of weird about doing repeats and recycled episodes, but a lot of people have
[31:29.990 --> 31:34.550]  asked the same questions and I'm realizing that a lot of podcasts listeners, you either
[31:34.550 --> 31:37.290]  do or you do not go listen to old episodes.
[31:37.290 --> 31:41.030]  If you listen to old episodes, you start at number one and you listen all the way up to
[31:41.030 --> 31:43.570]  the current or you just start where you are.
[31:43.570 --> 31:46.050]  That's kind of how podcast viewers and listeners are.
[31:46.050 --> 31:47.490]  Two types of podcast viewers.
[31:47.490 --> 31:48.490]  I love you both.
[31:48.490 --> 31:51.850]  I got no judgment, but they either go all the way back or they don't.
[31:51.850 --> 31:53.730]  So we got to redo a lot of stuff.
[31:53.730 --> 31:56.410]  Again I do invite you to go to listen to that old shit.
[31:56.410 --> 31:58.490]  Bro I am stoned and rambly.
[31:58.490 --> 32:02.930]  Let me wrap up this podcast while it still sounds good.
[32:02.930 --> 32:03.930]  Sincey nasty.
[32:03.930 --> 32:05.650]  Sincey thank you for the great message.
[32:05.650 --> 32:09.330]  Let me make sure I covered all the notes because I did abandon this one quite quickly.
[32:09.330 --> 32:11.410]  Yeah bro we covered all of this point.
[32:11.410 --> 32:12.410]  All of these points.
[32:12.410 --> 32:15.210]  You got to have a male and good females.
[32:15.210 --> 32:18.050]  If you're just going to make fem seeds then you don't have to worry about the boy, but
[32:18.050 --> 32:24.490]  you got to be certain that your pollen donors are tried, true, tested and reliable.
[32:24.490 --> 32:25.530]  I think I covered all that.
[32:25.530 --> 32:26.930]  I want to thank you for a great question.
[32:26.930 --> 32:29.770]  Dude thank you for the continued Patreon support.
