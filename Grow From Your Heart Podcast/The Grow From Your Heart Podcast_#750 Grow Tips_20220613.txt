[01:46.130 --> 01:48.150]  to support the show.
[01:48.150 --> 01:50.570]  Welcome to episode 750.
[01:50.570 --> 01:52.370]  I recently realized that I did miss
[01:52.370 --> 01:53.810]  the birthday for the podcast.
[01:53.810 --> 01:56.770]  On March 28th the podcast turned eight years.
[01:56.770 --> 01:58.290]  I'm not sure why I just noticed that
[01:58.290 --> 02:00.490]  and just cited that in my other show notes.
[02:00.490 --> 02:02.190]  But happy late birthday to the show.
[02:02.190 --> 02:04.810]  You guys we've been doing this for eight years.
[02:04.810 --> 02:06.570]  Thank you to everybody who's been listening
[02:06.570 --> 02:07.410]  since the beginning.
[02:07.410 --> 02:09.430]  Thanks to all the people who've just jumped on.
[02:09.430 --> 02:12.090]  Thanks for all the support, the words of encouragement,
[02:12.090 --> 02:14.790]  the wisdom, the constructive criticism.
[02:16.050 --> 02:17.690]  Thanks for putting up with all the throat clearing
[02:17.690 --> 02:18.850]  and the dab rambles.
[02:18.850 --> 02:20.050]  I do appreciate that.
[02:20.050 --> 02:22.710]  I've been getting a lot of positive feedback lately.
[02:22.710 --> 02:25.730]  Lots of great emails, lots of great YouTube comments.
[02:25.730 --> 02:27.130]  Before I complained that the YouTube,
[02:27.130 --> 02:28.930]  I didn't read the comments because they were,
[02:28.930 --> 02:30.490]  it was kind of a minefield.
[02:30.490 --> 02:32.030]  A bunch of just crappy comments,
[02:32.030 --> 02:33.450]  a bunch of negativity in there.
[02:33.450 --> 02:35.250]  The comments have really turned around on YouTube.
[02:35.250 --> 02:37.570]  It's nothing but positivity, nothing but goodness.
[02:37.570 --> 02:39.130]  I honestly don't delete the comments.
[02:39.130 --> 02:40.550]  I just let YouTube do the thing
[02:40.550 --> 02:43.350]  and the comments come and go and it's been positive.
[02:43.350 --> 02:45.150]  So thank you guys for the great YouTube comments,
[02:45.150 --> 02:46.950]  for the encouraging emails,
[02:46.950 --> 02:49.190]  all the social media shout outs and support.
[02:49.190 --> 02:50.550]  Thank you, that does mean a lot to me.
[02:50.550 --> 02:51.970]  It goes a long way.
[02:51.970 --> 02:53.830]  That like encourages me, it recharges me,
[02:53.830 --> 02:55.230]  it gives me a little bit of a boost.
[02:55.230 --> 02:57.690]  So thank you, I do appreciate all of that.
[02:57.690 --> 03:01.510]  Now let's try to get the show to 10,000 subscribers
[03:01.510 --> 03:02.770]  on YouTube, we're getting close.
[03:02.770 --> 03:06.250]  Right now we should be about 9.6 thousand subscribers.
[03:06.250 --> 03:07.870]  So please, if you are currently listening
[03:07.870 --> 03:09.990]  on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher Radio,
[03:09.990 --> 03:11.430]  maybe you're on Spotify,
[03:11.430 --> 03:12.890]  I'm not sure where you might be listening,
[03:12.890 --> 03:16.190]  but do please subscribe to the show on the YouTube channel.
[03:16.190 --> 03:17.510]  If you're watching on YouTube now,
[03:17.510 --> 03:20.070]  just simply click subscribe, do me the big favor,
[03:20.070 --> 03:22.610]  help me out, help me get to 10,000 subscribers.
[03:22.610 --> 03:24.510]  That is a goal that I have set.
[03:24.510 --> 03:26.310]  Help me get there, I do appreciate it.
[03:26.310 --> 03:27.430]  Where do we go from there?
[03:27.430 --> 03:29.570]  Oh also, please do continue to send me
[03:29.570 --> 03:32.870]  the great cannabis culture and cultivation questions.
[03:32.870 --> 03:35.090]  I love fueling the show off of questions
[03:35.090 --> 03:37.470]  that come from the viewers, that really helps me out.
[03:37.470 --> 03:39.970]  It lets me know that if I'm helping one person,
[03:40.850 --> 03:42.090]  if one person asked me the question,
[03:42.090 --> 03:43.410]  that means that probably 20 or 30,
[03:43.410 --> 03:46.030]  maybe 100 people out there actually needed that advice.
[03:46.030 --> 03:48.510]  So please do send me those grow questions.
[03:48.510 --> 03:50.370]  There's a grow help tab on the website.
[03:50.370 --> 03:53.470]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[03:53.470 --> 03:56.950]  The website is ieregenetics.com, there's a grow help tab.
[03:56.950 --> 03:58.850]  Go fill out a grow help questionnaire,
[03:58.850 --> 04:00.450]  that will help me answer your question.
[04:00.450 --> 04:01.970]  Please do keep those coming.
[04:01.970 --> 04:06.210]  Once again, I love making listener generated content.
[04:06.210 --> 04:07.970]  I do have one more quick thing to ramble about
[04:07.970 --> 04:09.550]  before we jump into the grow questions.
[04:10.070 --> 04:11.390]  I want some feedback.
[04:11.390 --> 04:13.670]  Do you like the podcast episodes with just me,
[04:13.670 --> 04:16.410]  or do you prefer a guest at the table?
[04:16.410 --> 04:19.010]  Do you guys like Zoom podcasts?
[04:19.010 --> 04:21.030]  Would you prefer me do the show solo,
[04:21.030 --> 04:22.750]  or do you like somebody on Zoom?
[04:22.750 --> 04:24.430]  Zoom shows kind of bug me.
[04:24.430 --> 04:26.030]  Recently I was on another podcast,
[04:26.030 --> 04:28.190]  and you can see me hesitating to reply,
[04:28.190 --> 04:29.890]  and you can see us kind of talking over each other,
[04:29.890 --> 04:33.190]  because Zoom has just a microsecond of a,
[04:33.190 --> 04:34.510]  a millisecond of a delay.
[04:34.510 --> 04:36.350]  So I'll be like, hey, how was your day?
[04:36.350 --> 04:37.670]  And then it'll be just a quick delay
[04:37.670 --> 04:39.310]  before the other person replies.
[04:40.070 --> 04:40.910]  And then by the time they've replied,
[04:40.910 --> 04:41.990]  I'm already going, are you cool, bro?
[04:41.990 --> 04:42.830]  Can you hear me?
[04:42.830 --> 04:44.030]  And they go, I can hear, we can.
[04:44.030 --> 04:44.910]  And there's this weird,
[04:44.910 --> 04:46.950]  just fucking stumble over each other.
[04:46.950 --> 04:49.670]  Zoom drives me crazy, but it's better than nothing.
[04:49.670 --> 04:51.970]  So if you guys are into seeing people on Zoom, let me know.
[04:51.970 --> 04:54.590]  If you'd prefer me to have people here, let me know.
[04:54.590 --> 04:57.210]  Let me know if you just prefer the podcast by myself.
[04:57.210 --> 04:58.670]  Let me know what you think.
[04:58.670 --> 05:00.890]  We will make adjustments as necessary.
[05:00.890 --> 05:02.310]  Let me know what you think about the show, you guys.
[05:02.310 --> 05:04.130]  That is all I'm asking for.
[05:04.130 --> 05:06.790]  Now let's talk about the main topics of today's podcast.
[05:06.790 --> 05:08.990]  I do want to talk about a couple of grow questions.
[05:09.670 --> 05:10.510]  First, I'm going to mention something
[05:10.510 --> 05:12.670]  that I saw in a grow recently.
[05:12.670 --> 05:15.270]  I was at a friend's grow, just a regular home grow.
[05:15.270 --> 05:17.390]  And my friend was watering their plants
[05:17.390 --> 05:19.910]  with the runoff from their dehumidifier.
[05:19.910 --> 05:21.350]  And I did express my concern
[05:21.350 --> 05:25.230]  because I'm not sure that that's a really good idea.
[05:25.230 --> 05:27.430]  The inside of that dehumidifier is gross.
[05:27.430 --> 05:30.050]  All the gunk and grime that's in your environment
[05:30.050 --> 05:31.710]  is gathering up on all the parts
[05:31.710 --> 05:33.130]  inside of that dehumidifier.
[05:33.130 --> 05:34.730]  I don't know exactly what's in there.
[05:34.730 --> 05:35.770]  I know that there are coils.
[05:35.770 --> 05:37.430]  I know there are a lot of things happening.
[05:37.430 --> 05:39.110]  I know that there's water collection.
[05:39.110 --> 05:41.110]  I know the water runs down a tube.
[05:41.110 --> 05:43.650]  That dehumidifier, anytime I've taken apart
[05:43.650 --> 05:45.270]  a humidifier or dehumidifier,
[05:45.270 --> 05:47.590]  it's been disgusting on the inside.
[05:47.590 --> 05:49.930]  I could only imagine that disgusting shit
[05:49.930 --> 05:51.870]  is landing right in your water.
[05:51.870 --> 05:53.750]  So unless you're able to test that water
[05:53.750 --> 05:54.990]  and you're making sure that it's clean,
[05:54.990 --> 05:56.950]  there's nothing funky in that water.
[05:56.950 --> 05:59.310]  I really wouldn't recommend watering your plants
[05:59.310 --> 06:01.870]  with the runoff from your dehumidifier.
[06:01.870 --> 06:02.710]  People are going to say,
[06:02.710 --> 06:04.710]  also your air conditioner condensation.
[06:04.710 --> 06:05.790]  I feel the same way about that.
[06:05.790 --> 06:07.590]  It's basically the same function.
[06:07.590 --> 06:09.590]  People are going to say that's clean distilled water,
[06:09.590 --> 06:11.630]  but I do not trust the equipment.
[06:11.630 --> 06:13.410]  It's got to run off of something.
[06:13.410 --> 06:15.390]  So whatever it ran off of, dribbled off of,
[06:15.390 --> 06:17.190]  could be dirty, could be funky,
[06:17.190 --> 06:18.150]  could have metals in it,
[06:18.150 --> 06:20.190]  could have funk in it is the bottom line
[06:20.190 --> 06:21.010]  that I'm worried about.
[06:21.010 --> 06:22.130]  So I don't want that.
[06:22.130 --> 06:25.710]  I would not recommend using the water
[06:25.710 --> 06:28.670]  from your dehumidifier to water your plants.
[06:28.670 --> 06:30.310]  Maybe do use that to like,
[06:30.310 --> 06:31.870]  if you've got a power washer or a power sprayer,
[06:31.870 --> 06:33.990]  maybe use that to clean the tables or something.
[06:33.990 --> 06:34.910]  Use that for cleaning.
[06:34.910 --> 06:35.790]  Use it for gray water,
[06:35.790 --> 06:38.670]  but do not use that for feeding the plants.
[06:38.670 --> 06:40.310]  That is just my recommendation.
[06:40.310 --> 06:42.750]  If you've got a qualified argument
[06:42.750 --> 06:44.470]  that you'd like to say why it is okay,
[06:44.470 --> 06:45.950]  go ahead, send me the feedback.
[06:45.950 --> 06:46.930]  I am open to feedback.
[06:46.930 --> 06:48.670]  We've had this conversation before.
[06:48.670 --> 06:50.650]  My opinion still stands.
[06:50.650 --> 06:52.350]  I do not recommend feeding the plants
[06:52.350 --> 06:54.030]  your dehumidifier water.
[06:54.030 --> 06:55.910]  Another thing that I saw my friend doing was
[06:55.910 --> 06:59.630]  he was not shaking the bottled nutrients enough.
[06:59.630 --> 07:02.170]  If you guys are feeding bottled nutrients to your plants,
[07:02.170 --> 07:03.450]  when you pick up that bottle,
[07:03.450 --> 07:04.890]  before you even unscrew the lid,
[07:05.730 --> 07:07.130]  before you even think about doing anything with it,
[07:07.130 --> 07:10.190]  I usually place my forefinger over the top of the cap
[07:10.190 --> 07:11.610]  to make sure the cap is sealed on there.
[07:11.610 --> 07:12.610]  Pick it up, give it a little twist,
[07:12.610 --> 07:13.890]  make sure the cap is sealed.
[07:13.890 --> 07:16.330]  Then I shake the shit out of that bottle.
[07:16.330 --> 07:18.290]  Those products have a lot of heavy stuff in there.
[07:18.290 --> 07:19.410]  You gotta shake them.
[07:19.410 --> 07:22.050]  If not, for the first few weeks as you're feeding,
[07:22.050 --> 07:23.130]  you're just gonna feed it water.
[07:23.130 --> 07:23.970]  And as you get down,
[07:23.970 --> 07:25.230]  you're gonna feed it all of the main stuff.
[07:25.230 --> 07:26.070]  And as you get to the bottom,
[07:26.070 --> 07:27.570]  you're gonna have a bunch of chunks left.
[07:27.570 --> 07:29.890]  Shake your nutrient bottles vigorously
[07:29.890 --> 07:31.510]  before you feed them to your plants,
[07:31.510 --> 07:32.930]  before you mix up your nutrients.
[07:32.930 --> 07:35.250]  Also check the expiration dates.
[07:35.250 --> 07:36.970]  Those things don't last forever.
[07:36.970 --> 07:37.890]  They will expire.
[07:37.890 --> 07:38.850]  They will start bonding.
[07:38.850 --> 07:40.890]  Weird things will happen inside the bottle.
[07:40.890 --> 07:43.170]  Once you mix that weird product with other products,
[07:43.170 --> 07:44.910]  even more weird shit will happen.
[07:44.910 --> 07:46.810]  So check the expiration date.
[07:46.810 --> 07:48.410]  One piece of advice.
[07:48.410 --> 07:51.970]  I do recommend you mix your potassium silicate first.
[07:51.970 --> 07:53.810]  If you're putting silicates in the water,
[07:53.810 --> 07:55.290]  put that in the water first,
[07:55.290 --> 07:56.610]  then give it a stir,
[07:56.610 --> 07:59.010]  then mix in your other stuff.
[07:59.010 --> 08:01.250]  It doesn't matter to me very specifically
[08:01.250 --> 08:03.450]  which other products you put in which order.
[08:03.450 --> 08:04.890]  I would go the silicates,
[08:04.890 --> 08:06.250]  then your base nutrients,
[08:06.250 --> 08:09.030]  then kind of follow up with whatever needs to be done.
[08:09.030 --> 08:10.970]  The CalMag, the potassium,
[08:10.970 --> 08:12.130]  just whichever bottles you're buying.
[08:12.130 --> 08:12.970]  I don't know the order.
[08:12.970 --> 08:14.210]  Then adjust the pH,
[08:14.210 --> 08:15.490]  then add your microbes.
[08:15.490 --> 08:16.570]  But what I was gonna say is,
[08:16.570 --> 08:18.090]  stir in all of your products,
[08:18.090 --> 08:20.070]  everything except your microbes,
[08:20.070 --> 08:21.370]  then adjust the pH.
[08:21.370 --> 08:24.610]  I recently saw somebody adjust the pH of their water
[08:24.610 --> 08:26.730]  using the little pH adjuster and some drops, right?
[08:26.730 --> 08:29.350]  So they got the water to 6.4.
[08:29.350 --> 08:31.310]  Then they added their nutrients to it.
[08:31.310 --> 08:32.910]  Then they added their microbes to it.
[08:32.910 --> 08:34.550]  Then they fed it to the plants.
[08:34.550 --> 08:35.950]  That is not the correct order.
[08:35.950 --> 08:37.150]  Let's think about that,
[08:37.150 --> 08:38.970]  why that's not the correct order.
[08:38.970 --> 08:40.670]  We want the nutrient solution
[08:40.670 --> 08:41.990]  which we are feeding our plants
[08:41.990 --> 08:45.230]  to be somewhere between 6.2 and 6.5, 6.6,
[08:45.230 --> 08:47.650]  probably about 6.2, 6.4 is where I hover.
[08:47.650 --> 08:48.670]  Do your thing in your grow.
[08:48.670 --> 08:49.710]  If you're saying different numbers,
[08:49.710 --> 08:51.110]  do that what works for you.
[08:51.110 --> 08:52.590]  I'm talking about what I standardize,
[08:52.590 --> 08:53.870]  what I normally do.
[08:53.870 --> 08:55.190]  So we'd mix the water up,
[08:55.190 --> 08:56.710]  and then we watched our friend
[08:56.710 --> 08:59.070]  put the nutrient, the pH drops in there
[08:59.790 --> 09:00.630]  to get it to the right pH.
[09:00.630 --> 09:02.270]  Now, when we add nutrients,
[09:02.270 --> 09:04.710]  it's going to drastically change the pH.
[09:04.710 --> 09:07.550]  So you would put your nutrients in first,
[09:07.550 --> 09:09.590]  put your potassium silicate,
[09:09.590 --> 09:11.790]  shake the bottle, put the potassium silicate in there,
[09:11.790 --> 09:13.630]  get your next bottle, probably your base nutrient,
[09:13.630 --> 09:14.510]  shake the shit out of it,
[09:14.510 --> 09:16.310]  measure it out, put it in there.
[09:16.310 --> 09:17.890]  In whatever size container you're mixing,
[09:17.890 --> 09:19.870]  I usually mix in, if it's a small batch,
[09:19.870 --> 09:20.710]  I got a five gallon.
[09:20.710 --> 09:22.470]  If it's a big batch, it's a 55 gallon.
[09:22.470 --> 09:24.450]  Sometimes it's 500 gallons.
[09:24.450 --> 09:27.190]  I'm going to assume you're mixing into a five gallon bucket.
[09:27.190 --> 09:28.430]  So you got your five gallon bucket
[09:28.790 --> 09:30.910]  mostly filled with water most of the way.
[09:30.910 --> 09:32.390]  Then you start with your potassium silicate,
[09:32.390 --> 09:34.510]  shake the bottle, put it in your measuring unit,
[09:34.510 --> 09:36.590]  pour it into the container,
[09:36.590 --> 09:37.930]  then clean, give it a little wipe.
[09:37.930 --> 09:39.910]  Give your measuring unit a little bit of a wipe.
[09:39.910 --> 09:41.730]  I use a shot glass or maybe something bigger,
[09:41.730 --> 09:43.430]  depending on how big I'm measuring.
[09:43.430 --> 09:45.790]  Wipe that out, shake up your next bottle,
[09:45.790 --> 09:46.990]  pour out the desired amount,
[09:46.990 --> 09:49.030]  toss it into your res, clean that out,
[09:49.030 --> 09:50.630]  repeat the process until you're done,
[09:50.630 --> 09:51.990]  then adjust to the pH.
[09:51.990 --> 09:54.070]  That is when you put your pH meter in there
[09:54.070 --> 09:55.650]  and you start putting your drops in there
[09:55.650 --> 09:57.150]  to get it to the amount that you want.
[09:57.150 --> 09:59.470]  Also, you can check the EC at that time also
[09:59.470 --> 10:03.150]  if you would like, but adjusting the pH is the final step.
[10:03.150 --> 10:05.150]  You want to do that right before you feed it to the plants
[10:05.150 --> 10:07.630]  because it will change if you do anything else to it.
[10:07.630 --> 10:10.450]  If you do anything else to it, other than add microbes,
[10:10.450 --> 10:12.590]  that's the only thing I would recommend doing after the pH,
[10:12.590 --> 10:15.830]  but anything else, it will change the pH of your solution.
[10:15.830 --> 10:17.190]  If you're going to add more water
[10:17.190 --> 10:18.310]  because it's not full enough,
[10:18.310 --> 10:21.390]  or if you've gotten too high of an EC or a PPM,
[10:21.390 --> 10:24.130]  adjust that pH after all of those adjustments.
[10:24.130 --> 10:25.730]  Then water carefully.
[10:25.730 --> 10:28.330]  Here's something else I noticed that my friends grow.
[10:28.330 --> 10:29.530]  If you've got big pots,
[10:29.530 --> 10:31.630]  if you've got a three or a five gallon pot,
[10:31.630 --> 10:34.270]  I don't recommend dumping all of your water
[10:34.270 --> 10:36.950]  directly into the middle of that pot.
[10:36.950 --> 10:39.110]  Water around the outer edge of that pot.
[10:39.110 --> 10:40.650]  So you got your plant sticking up,
[10:40.650 --> 10:42.130]  you got, so probably a 10, 12,
[10:42.130 --> 10:44.730]  maybe a 14 inch diameter plant or a pot.
[10:44.730 --> 10:45.970]  Water the outer edge
[10:45.970 --> 10:47.570]  and then work your way in with the water.
[10:47.570 --> 10:50.250]  The water is going to work its way in anyway.
[10:50.250 --> 10:53.370]  All of the roots of that plant that want that water
[10:53.370 --> 10:55.050]  are out at the outer edge of the pot.
[10:55.370 --> 10:56.530]  They're not on the inside.
[10:56.530 --> 10:58.810]  Think about, look at the shape of a cannabis plant.
[10:58.810 --> 11:02.330]  Look at the shape of most plants that you see in nature.
[11:02.330 --> 11:03.970]  If we look at the shape of a cannabis plant,
[11:03.970 --> 11:06.410]  it is shaped kind of a triangular shape, right?
[11:06.410 --> 11:08.250]  But if you look at the top leaves,
[11:08.250 --> 11:11.150]  they work like the shingles of a roof.
[11:11.150 --> 11:13.270]  Those top leaves, when the water hits them,
[11:13.270 --> 11:14.570]  they will droop down
[11:14.570 --> 11:16.610]  and the water will run down those leaves
[11:16.610 --> 11:18.630]  right down to the next set of leaves.
[11:18.630 --> 11:21.390]  Then it will gently run it down and outward.
[11:21.390 --> 11:23.930]  As it goes down, it goes outward every time.
[11:23.930 --> 11:24.770]  That's just kind of the way
[11:24.770 --> 11:27.450]  that the leaves in the plant are shaped and what it does.
[11:27.450 --> 11:28.810]  Then when it lands on the ground,
[11:28.810 --> 11:32.090]  you'll notice there's a nice circle around your plants.
[11:32.090 --> 11:33.810]  If you just get a nice light rain,
[11:33.810 --> 11:35.570]  a nice little spring sprinkle,
[11:35.570 --> 11:37.490]  and you don't over over rain too much,
[11:37.490 --> 11:38.450]  I almost said over water.
[11:38.450 --> 11:39.450]  We don't have any control of that.
[11:39.450 --> 11:41.370]  If you don't over rain too much,
[11:41.370 --> 11:43.690]  you'll see just a nice circle around your plants,
[11:43.690 --> 11:46.170]  around the bottom, like they were sitting under an umbrella.
[11:46.170 --> 11:48.170]  They're providing their own umbrella effect.
[11:48.170 --> 11:50.450]  They don't want all that water right there on the toes.
[11:50.450 --> 11:51.690]  They want it out there on the roots,
[11:51.690 --> 11:53.890]  the feeder roots that are out at the edge of the plant.
[11:54.650 --> 11:56.130]  Water that outer edge of your pots,
[11:56.130 --> 11:57.850]  of your buckets, of your containers,
[11:57.850 --> 12:00.130]  and water the inside a little bit lighter
[12:00.130 --> 12:02.530]  because that's where you run the risk of over watering
[12:02.530 --> 12:03.690]  is flooding that inside.
[12:03.690 --> 12:04.930]  Now, my disclaimer,
[12:04.930 --> 12:06.890]  if you're running little plants in large pots
[12:06.890 --> 12:09.090]  and they're not fully established at this time,
[12:09.090 --> 12:10.250]  water as necessary.
[12:10.250 --> 12:11.330]  Water where the roots are.
[12:11.330 --> 12:13.350]  But once you get that pot filled with roots,
[12:13.350 --> 12:15.610]  the plant's really established and really banging,
[12:15.610 --> 12:16.690]  that's when you wanna go ahead
[12:16.690 --> 12:18.950]  and start watering the outer circumference,
[12:18.950 --> 12:20.190]  I think is the word I'm looking for,
[12:20.190 --> 12:22.050]  the outer edge of those plants.
[12:22.050 --> 12:24.210]  And work your way in toward the center.
[12:24.210 --> 12:26.290]  Those outer roots are the thirsty roots.
[12:26.290 --> 12:28.030]  Those are the roots that need the water.
[12:28.030 --> 12:28.870]  They're searching,
[12:28.870 --> 12:30.570]  they're already going out there to get the water.
[12:30.570 --> 12:32.290]  Keep in mind that umbrella idea,
[12:32.290 --> 12:34.810]  the shingles idea, the roofing idea,
[12:34.810 --> 12:35.810]  really keep that in mind
[12:35.810 --> 12:37.370]  when you're thinking about watering the plants.
[12:37.370 --> 12:40.170]  Don't over water them.
[12:40.170 --> 12:41.570]  Now, another thing I wanna touch on
[12:41.570 --> 12:43.050]  before we start wrapping up the episode
[12:43.050 --> 12:47.930]  is don't overlook the importance of your vegetative space.
[12:47.930 --> 12:49.530]  I've seen several grows recently
[12:49.530 --> 12:50.850]  where you can tell that the grower
[12:50.850 --> 12:54.910]  obviously put 75 to 90% of their funding,
[12:54.910 --> 12:57.610]  energy, effort, and time into the flowering room.
[12:57.610 --> 13:01.370]  And the veg space, you can tell that they put 10, 15,
[13:01.370 --> 13:05.170]  maybe 25% of their time, energy, budget, effort,
[13:05.170 --> 13:07.770]  love and care into that veg space.
[13:07.770 --> 13:09.930]  The veg space is your foundation.
[13:09.930 --> 13:11.050]  That is where it all starts.
[13:11.050 --> 13:12.650]  We all get excited in the flower room.
[13:12.650 --> 13:13.970]  When you drag the plants into flower,
[13:13.970 --> 13:16.130]  it's like, oh yeah, flowers are coming,
[13:16.130 --> 13:17.970]  money is coming, the pictures are coming,
[13:17.970 --> 13:19.530]  the progress is coming.
[13:19.570 --> 13:21.930]  But without a solid foundation,
[13:21.930 --> 13:24.370]  you're not gonna get the money, the pictures,
[13:24.370 --> 13:26.850]  the crop, the harvest, the potency, the weight.
[13:26.850 --> 13:28.110]  None of that stuff will come
[13:28.110 --> 13:30.730]  if you don't have a quality veg setup.
[13:30.730 --> 13:35.030]  So stop overlooking the importance of the vegetative phase,
[13:35.030 --> 13:36.510]  the vegetative space,
[13:36.510 --> 13:40.010]  start allocating more of your budget to that veg room,
[13:40.010 --> 13:42.650]  the veg space, especially the veg feeding.
[13:42.650 --> 13:44.550]  I see a lot of people underfeeding in veg.
[13:44.550 --> 13:46.410]  They think that it could just kind of veg,
[13:46.410 --> 13:47.370]  then when it comes to flower,
[13:47.370 --> 13:48.530]  they'll start really feeding it.
[13:48.530 --> 13:50.570]  But our plants take up and absorb
[13:50.570 --> 13:53.330]  and store a lot of their nitrogen
[13:53.330 --> 13:54.850]  during the vegetative stage.
[13:54.850 --> 13:56.630]  A lot of their nutrients come from veg,
[13:56.630 --> 13:58.890]  so build them up, get them strong.
[13:58.890 --> 14:01.690]  You wouldn't put, so a lot of people say it's just a weed,
[14:01.690 --> 14:03.050]  I don't need to feed it, right?
[14:03.050 --> 14:04.530]  Well, think about it like this.
[14:04.530 --> 14:06.450]  Do you want high performance cannabis plants
[14:06.450 --> 14:08.890]  or do you just want lazy couch potato plants?
[14:08.890 --> 14:10.930]  You can grow plants that look like me.
[14:10.930 --> 14:14.050]  I'm six foot five and I weigh about 190 pounds.
[14:14.050 --> 14:15.610]  I can hide behind a flagpole.
[14:15.610 --> 14:16.850]  I'm super skinny.
[14:16.850 --> 14:19.290]  I'm in pretty good shape, but I am super skinny.
[14:19.290 --> 14:21.330]  My point is I am not training for any fights.
[14:21.330 --> 14:22.650]  I'm not gonna get in the ring.
[14:22.650 --> 14:24.690]  I'm not gonna do anything anytime soon.
[14:24.690 --> 14:25.530]  I'm just fine.
[14:25.530 --> 14:26.370]  I work.
[14:26.370 --> 14:27.410]  I do what I'm doing.
[14:27.410 --> 14:28.690]  I get the job done.
[14:28.690 --> 14:30.650]  Or, or your other option,
[14:30.650 --> 14:32.490]  I could go to the gym every fucking day.
[14:32.490 --> 14:33.730]  I could pound protein shakes.
[14:33.730 --> 14:35.610]  I could put steroids in my neck.
[14:35.610 --> 14:37.250]  I could do all kinds of crazy shit.
[14:37.250 --> 14:38.930]  I could anavar up.
[14:38.930 --> 14:40.950]  And then I could be the big Brock Lesnar looking dude,
[14:40.950 --> 14:43.610]  but I'd have to put in a ton of fucking more work to do it.
[14:43.610 --> 14:45.930]  You can have cannabis plants that look like me
[14:45.930 --> 14:48.690]  or you can have cannabis plants that look like Brock Lesnar.
[14:48.690 --> 14:49.530]  It is up to you.
[14:49.530 --> 14:50.550]  Do you wanna feed them?
[14:50.550 --> 14:51.730]  Do you wanna do the work to them?
[14:51.730 --> 14:54.330]  Do you wanna give them the work, the extra love,
[14:54.330 --> 14:55.730]  the extra care, the extra attention,
[14:55.730 --> 14:58.250]  or do you just wanna water them and just let them survive
[14:58.250 --> 15:00.410]  and let them grow up and be tall and skinny like me?
[15:00.410 --> 15:03.290]  I think everybody really wants, deep down inside,
[15:03.290 --> 15:04.930]  we all want the fucking Brock Lesnar,
[15:04.930 --> 15:07.330]  ultimate warrior, fucking ninja warrior,
[15:07.330 --> 15:08.450]  fucking savage plants.
[15:08.450 --> 15:09.930]  That's what we really all want.
[15:09.930 --> 15:11.170]  But to get to that kind of a crop,
[15:11.170 --> 15:13.090]  you've got to do the work every single day.
[15:13.090 --> 15:14.970]  There are details that need to be managed.
[15:14.970 --> 15:16.410]  The room needs to be checked on.
[15:16.410 --> 15:17.910]  The equipment needs to be inspected.
[15:17.910 --> 15:19.230]  The water needs to be perfect.
[15:19.230 --> 15:21.150]  The watering timing needs to be right.
[15:21.150 --> 15:22.810]  Did you defoliate on the right day?
[15:22.810 --> 15:24.490]  Did you pop and twist on the right day?
[15:24.490 --> 15:26.890]  Is the fan coming on at just the right time?
[15:26.890 --> 15:28.530]  There's a lot of details to dial in
[15:28.530 --> 15:31.730]  if you wanna get that Brock Lesnar bud.
[15:31.730 --> 15:33.850]  The buds can only be, in the end,
[15:33.850 --> 15:37.650]  your buds can only be as powerful, potent, heavy, dense.
[15:37.650 --> 15:39.970]  They can only be as quality as your veg was.
[15:39.970 --> 15:42.210]  So if your veg is like a five out of 10,
[15:42.210 --> 15:43.330]  your flowers are going,
[15:43.330 --> 15:45.730]  no matter how good your flowering room is,
[15:45.730 --> 15:47.130]  your flowers are gonna come out.
[15:47.130 --> 15:49.530]  Maybe a five, maybe a six or a seven out of a 10.
[15:49.530 --> 15:51.130]  That's the best you're ever gonna get
[15:51.130 --> 15:52.410]  if your veg room is shitty.
[15:52.410 --> 15:54.270]  If your veg room is a seven or eight,
[15:54.270 --> 15:55.890]  you've got the potential of eight or nine
[15:55.890 --> 15:56.810]  buds coming out of there.
[15:56.810 --> 15:58.210]  But you're not gonna do great
[15:58.210 --> 16:01.330]  if you're not paying a lot of attention to the veg area.
[16:01.330 --> 16:02.670]  Get your lighting right.
[16:02.670 --> 16:04.250]  A lot of people overlook the importance
[16:04.250 --> 16:05.170]  of a light and veg.
[16:05.170 --> 16:07.510]  They have a light that will get the plants to grow.
[16:07.510 --> 16:09.210]  What if those plants fucking grew?
[16:09.210 --> 16:10.250]  What if they exploded?
[16:10.250 --> 16:11.990]  What if they had vigorous growth?
[16:11.990 --> 16:14.150]  What if they were growing so quickly and so healthily
[16:14.150 --> 16:16.370]  that you had to cut clones and harvest
[16:16.370 --> 16:18.550]  or cut clones and get into flower early?
[16:18.550 --> 16:19.390]  What if?
[16:19.390 --> 16:21.110]  What if you were reusing the right equipment?
[16:21.110 --> 16:23.510]  What if your airflow was better in your veg space?
[16:23.510 --> 16:25.670]  I see a lot of people with terrible airflow
[16:25.670 --> 16:28.110]  because they say, oh, it can take the high humidity.
[16:28.110 --> 16:31.190]  Your plants will thrive if you give them a better VPD.
[16:31.190 --> 16:35.030]  That vapor pressure deficit will make a huge difference.
[16:35.030 --> 16:36.030]  I wrote down feed.
[16:36.030 --> 16:37.590]  Make sure you're feeding these plants.
[16:37.590 --> 16:40.110]  They do need food even in the veg phase.
[16:40.110 --> 16:41.310]  Give them nitrogen.
[16:41.310 --> 16:42.710]  Give them the cow mag that they need.
[16:42.710 --> 16:44.370]  Give them microbes to get them going.
[16:44.370 --> 16:46.870]  Give them anything you could imagine to get them boosted.
[16:46.870 --> 16:47.710]  Then while you're in there,
[16:47.710 --> 16:49.950]  give them some general maintenance and care.
[16:49.950 --> 16:50.950]  Clean up the bottoms.
[16:50.950 --> 16:52.750]  If you want the plants to grow up and get thick,
[16:52.750 --> 16:54.430]  take off all that bullshit off the bottom
[16:54.430 --> 16:57.070]  that's wasting time, energy, and space.
[16:57.070 --> 16:58.010]  You don't need to grow that.
[16:58.010 --> 16:59.630]  The light's not gonna get down there.
[16:59.630 --> 17:02.350]  You're just wasting plant energy by producing all that.
[17:02.350 --> 17:05.090]  Are you popping and twisting the stems at the right times?
[17:05.090 --> 17:08.270]  That will definitely help your plants get more strength,
[17:08.270 --> 17:09.230]  get more robust.
[17:09.230 --> 17:11.790]  It will slow down the vertical growth when it comes time.
[17:11.790 --> 17:14.430]  Are you doing all that maintenance that needs to be done?
[17:14.430 --> 17:16.830]  All of that stuff adds up to strong,
[17:16.830 --> 17:18.230]  vigorous plants in flower.
[17:18.230 --> 17:20.310]  If you don't train them, if you don't prepare them,
[17:20.310 --> 17:22.930]  when you send them into battle, they will not be prepared.
[17:22.930 --> 17:24.630]  They will not be what you were expecting.
[17:24.630 --> 17:26.590]  You will not get the desired outcome.
[17:26.590 --> 17:28.450]  You're gonna pay for the electricity.
[17:28.450 --> 17:30.670]  No matter what you do, the electricity,
[17:30.670 --> 17:32.430]  the electric company, you can't call them and go,
[17:32.430 --> 17:33.910]  hey, I kind of fucked up this crop.
[17:33.910 --> 17:36.270]  We didn't get as many buds as we were hoping for.
[17:36.270 --> 17:37.390]  We're like half a pound short.
[17:37.390 --> 17:38.970]  You think you'd give me a deal on electricity?
[17:39.710 --> 17:41.410]  They're gonna go, ha ha, fuck you, pay the electric bill,
[17:41.410 --> 17:42.530]  and if you don't, we're turning it off
[17:42.530 --> 17:44.130]  and you don't get to grow anymore at all.
[17:44.130 --> 17:47.030]  So you gotta get the crop, you gotta get the electricity.
[17:47.030 --> 17:48.450]  You're going to be in there spending time.
[17:48.450 --> 17:50.370]  Why not put quality time in that grow?
[17:50.370 --> 17:52.450]  A lot of people just hang out and stare at the plants.
[17:52.450 --> 17:54.330]  I do that, that's called the grower's gaze.
[17:54.330 --> 17:56.450]  I learn a lot, but don't just be in there wasting time.
[17:56.450 --> 17:59.090]  Don't go play video games until all the work is done.
[17:59.090 --> 18:00.770]  Pay attention, spend the time
[18:00.770 --> 18:02.530]  that you need to spend in there.
[18:02.530 --> 18:04.570]  That's when the, you're gonna spend a lot of time on it.
[18:04.570 --> 18:06.810]  Why not spend a few extra minutes and make it great?
[18:06.810 --> 18:09.050]  You could spend a few minutes and make it good,
[18:09.050 --> 18:10.330]  or you could spend a lot of minutes
[18:10.330 --> 18:11.770]  and make it fucking great.
[18:11.770 --> 18:12.970]  If you're gonna feed the plants,
[18:12.970 --> 18:15.170]  feed them quality nutrients at a quality time
[18:15.170 --> 18:16.410]  on a good schedule.
[18:16.410 --> 18:17.730]  You gotta pay for the nutrients.
[18:17.730 --> 18:19.850]  You're gonna buy them, you're gonna spend the money.
[18:19.850 --> 18:21.890]  Why not feed the plants properly?
[18:21.890 --> 18:23.650]  The airflow, get the airflow right.
[18:23.650 --> 18:24.610]  You guys see where I'm going.
[18:24.610 --> 18:26.850]  If you're gonna do it, do it right.
[18:26.850 --> 18:28.630]  Grow the best herb that you can.
[18:28.630 --> 18:31.770]  Get that veg space set up, get that veg space dialed in.
[18:31.770 --> 18:33.450]  That way when you move them into flower,
[18:33.450 --> 18:34.770]  there's no transition skip.
[18:34.770 --> 18:36.610]  They just go, oh yeah, we were waiting for that.
[18:37.410 --> 18:38.650]  It's time to flower, here come the buds.
[18:38.650 --> 18:40.210]  And a few weeks later, you start seeing
[18:40.210 --> 18:42.970]  the biggest, fattest buds building up.
[18:42.970 --> 18:44.570]  You guys, I really do try to inspire you.
[18:44.570 --> 18:45.890]  I don't mean to overwhelm you.
[18:45.890 --> 18:48.330]  I do talk about doing things correctly,
[18:48.330 --> 18:51.070]  doing the proper steps, adding a few steps to get it right,
[18:51.070 --> 18:53.870]  taking a few notes so that you can remember what you did.
[18:53.870 --> 18:56.130]  I talk about having the right equipment.
[18:56.130 --> 18:57.050]  Get the right gear.
[18:57.050 --> 18:59.810]  I know a lot of shit's really expensive and times are tough,
[18:59.810 --> 19:01.490]  but if you're gonna do it, do it right
[19:01.490 --> 19:02.430]  and make it worth doing.
[19:02.430 --> 19:04.210]  And then every time you harvest,
[19:04.210 --> 19:07.730]  invest some of that harvest back into your grow.
[19:07.730 --> 19:08.890]  I'm just here to inspire you.
[19:08.890 --> 19:10.450]  I don't mean to intimidate you.
[19:10.450 --> 19:12.810]  If it's a lot to take in, I do apologize.
[19:12.810 --> 19:14.030]  Keep watching, keep listening.
[19:14.030 --> 19:16.090]  We will get you all caught up to speed.
[19:16.090 --> 19:19.310]  None of this will be intimidating after a few episodes.
[19:19.310 --> 19:21.330]  All right, that is all I've got for you for this episode.
[19:21.330 --> 19:23.810]  I feel like it went by super quickly, but I had fun.
[19:23.810 --> 19:25.730]  I hope you had as good of a time as I did.
