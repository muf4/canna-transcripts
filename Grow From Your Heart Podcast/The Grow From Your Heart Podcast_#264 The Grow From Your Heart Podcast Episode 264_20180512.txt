[00:15.480 --> 00:20.480]  Welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for episode number 264 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:20.480 --> 00:24.480]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:24.480 --> 00:29.480]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a news smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:29.480 --> 00:33.480]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:33.480 --> 00:36.480]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:36.480 --> 00:40.480]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:40.480 --> 00:46.480]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:46.480 --> 00:51.480]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:51.480 --> 00:56.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the podcast is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[00:56.480 --> 01:03.480]  If you need new seeds for your lineup, visit the Hella Dank Seed Bank at dankseed.store.
[01:03.480 --> 01:07.480]  I hope everybody's having a great day. I hope everybody had a good holiday.
[01:08.480 --> 01:11.480]  I hope everybody stuffed themselves. I hope you shared a meal with some friends and family.
[01:11.480 --> 01:13.480]  And I hope you were safe.
[01:13.480 --> 01:16.480]  Hey, I hope you got to consume some cannabis with somebody new over the holiday.
[01:16.480 --> 01:20.480]  If you got to smoke cannabis with a new family member over the holiday, I would love to hear about it.
[01:20.480 --> 01:24.480]  Send me a tweet. Send me an email. On Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast.
[01:24.480 --> 01:27.480]  The email is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:27.480 --> 01:33.480]  If you smoked or consumed cannabis in some way with somebody new over this Thanksgiving holiday,
[01:33.480 --> 01:36.480]  especially a family member, I would like to hear about it.
[01:36.480 --> 01:38.480]  Share your story with me.
[01:38.480 --> 01:41.480]  Speaking of smoking with people, what am I smoking on?
[01:41.480 --> 01:46.480]  I just took a gigantic dab of some Barry Cooler Shatter and it really hit the spot.
[01:46.480 --> 01:49.480]  I've been talking about different kinds of concentrates here on the show.
[01:49.480 --> 01:55.480]  I smoke the HCFSE. I smoke the batters, the rosins. I don't smoke a lot of rosins.
[01:55.480 --> 02:03.480]  I smoke a lot of batters. I smoke a lot of Ambrosia and Live Resins and the QRCs and the HCFSE.
[02:03.480 --> 02:06.480]  No, don't go Google and QRC, you guys. That's not a real thing. I just made that up.
[02:06.480 --> 02:10.480]  Please don't go Google that. That's the future. That's Alien Hash. It's coming soon.
[02:10.480 --> 02:13.480]  But what I was getting at is I think I like Shatter.
[02:13.480 --> 02:16.480]  I've got some batter. I've got some Live Resin. I've got some butters.
[02:16.480 --> 02:21.480]  I've got a lot of great stuff available, but I tend to reach for the Shatter most often.
[02:21.480 --> 02:24.480]  Something about the Shatter, it's affordable. It gives me a giant dab.
[02:24.480 --> 02:29.480]  It seems old school. That's back to when Hash started getting really popular again.
[02:29.480 --> 02:32.480]  Shatter is where it all started. I really seem to like the Shatter.
[02:32.480 --> 02:39.480]  With that being said, I think my next dab is going to be a dab of this Screamin' Tangerines batter from Apothecary.
[02:39.480 --> 02:42.480]  So it's going to be a Berry Cooler and Screamin' Tangerines type of episode.
[02:42.480 --> 02:45.480]  I hope you guys are smoking on something delicious with me.
[02:45.480 --> 02:53.480]  All right, in this podcast, I do want to talk about a little bit of a debate between organic and synthetic nutrients and organic and synthetic gardening.
[02:53.480 --> 02:57.480]  But before I get there, I would like to read some iTunes comments.
[02:57.480 --> 03:01.480]  Let's turn down this music just a little bit. Here we will get into some iTunes comments and reviews.
[03:01.480 --> 03:03.480]  They're actually iTunes customer reviews.
[03:03.480 --> 03:06.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, I would love it if you would leave me a review on iTunes.
[03:06.480 --> 03:13.480]  If you're listening to the podcast on iTunes, simply go to the iTunes store, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast, scroll down about halfway.
[03:13.480 --> 03:18.480]  There will be a big square with my face in the middle. It's a red, yellow, and green square with my face in the middle.
[03:18.480 --> 03:23.480]  Click on that. You'll have three options. The one in the middle will be ratings and reviews.
[03:23.480 --> 03:29.480]  When you go there, you'll be able to type in a customer review, and you'll be able to leave a star-based rating.
[03:29.480 --> 03:35.480]  So far, most people, everybody except for one person, has left a five-star review or a five-star rating.
[03:35.480 --> 03:40.480]  One person has left a four-star rating. Everybody seems to be leaving positive reviews.
[03:40.480 --> 03:44.480]  I've got two reviews I have not read, so let's get to them here on the show.
[03:44.480 --> 03:49.480]  This first iTunes customer review was left by a person who calls himself Maddie E.
[03:49.480 --> 03:54.480]  And the review goes like this. The headline says, The Best, and they gave me five stars.
[03:54.480 --> 03:59.480]  And then they said, This is by far the best fully comprehensive podcast about cannabis out there.
[03:59.480 --> 04:03.480]  What a great find. Thanks, Rasta Jeff, for all the knowledge and good vibes.
[04:03.480 --> 04:10.480]  Hey, Maddie E., you are very welcome. Thank you for the great encouraging review and the five-star rating.
[04:10.480 --> 04:15.480]  I truly appreciate that. I'm glad you find my show to be comprehensive. That means a lot to me.
[04:15.480 --> 04:20.480]  Sometimes I feel like I may over-talk a certain subject, but I'm really trying to make sure you guys don't make mistakes out there.
[04:20.480 --> 04:23.480]  I'm trying to give you the best advice and guidance I can.
[04:23.480 --> 04:27.480]  I can't make eye contact with anybody when I'm doing this, so I don't know if what I'm saying is sinking in.
[04:27.480 --> 04:32.480]  I can't see any facial expressions, so I'm not sure if people look confused or if they're catching on.
[04:32.480 --> 04:35.480]  So I just over-talk my shit until I'm sure that everybody gets it.
[04:35.480 --> 04:38.480]  So I'm glad you find it comprehensive. I appreciate that.
[04:38.480 --> 04:42.480]  Dude, thanks for the great review, and thanks for the five-star rating.
[04:42.480 --> 04:46.480]  I'm going to read the next one. It comes from a person who calls themselves Denny D. Bat.
[04:47.480 --> 04:51.480]  And the headline was, Great podcast. Of course, they gave me five stars. The review goes like this.
[04:51.480 --> 04:58.480]  Great podcast and very informative. Rasta Jeff gives detailed information and sound advice in all growing applications.
[04:58.480 --> 05:02.480]  The guests are always good too, and I like it when they ramble. Thanks, Rasta Jeff.
[05:02.480 --> 05:05.480]  Once again, thank you, Denny. I appreciate the great review.
[05:05.480 --> 05:09.480]  I'm glad you find it informative because, like I said, I like to talk my ass off.
[05:09.480 --> 05:12.480]  Sometimes I feel like I may be over-rambling, so I'm glad you appreciate it.
[05:12.480 --> 05:15.480]  And it's good to hear that people say they like it when we ramble.
[05:15.480 --> 05:19.480]  I'm glad you find my detailed information useful. I'm glad you don't find it overwhelming.
[05:19.480 --> 05:22.480]  Like I said, I could get to, get to be.
[05:22.480 --> 05:25.480]  And all applications, all growing applications.
[05:25.480 --> 05:29.480]  You know, I'm not sure that I talk enough about hydro and stuff like that because that's not my wheelhouse,
[05:29.480 --> 05:35.480]  but I will try to get people in here to talk about things that are out of my comfort zone and teach me and you all things.
[05:35.480 --> 05:41.480]  I'm glad you like my guests, and I'm glad you like it when we ramble because sometimes we do take too many dabs.
[05:41.480 --> 05:46.480]  We meaning myself, and we do get quite rambly here, so I'm glad you enjoy it.
[05:46.480 --> 05:50.480]  Thanks for the great review, and thanks for the five-star rating. I truly do appreciate that.
[05:50.480 --> 05:57.480]  Once again, you guys, I would appreciate it if everybody who listens on iTunes would go to the iTunes store and just leave a short, sweet review.
[05:57.480 --> 06:02.480]  Let me know what you think about the podcast, and I will read your review on a future episode.
[06:02.480 --> 06:06.480]  All right, let's get into the main topic of this podcast now.
[06:06.480 --> 06:12.480]  At the start of the show, I said that I wanted to talk a little bit about growing with synthetic versus growing with organic nutrients.
[06:12.480 --> 06:18.480]  Before I get too far into this, I want to make some disclaimers and say that I am not on either side of this debate.
[06:18.480 --> 06:23.480]  I am a cannabis grower, and I support you growing cannabis the way that you are passionate about doing so.
[06:23.480 --> 06:30.480]  If you want to grow organically, if you want to grow no-till, if you want to grow with salts and rockwool,
[06:30.480 --> 06:35.480]  however you want to grow, I support you, and I love you for growing cannabis as long as you do so safely and carefully
[06:35.480 --> 06:38.480]  and you don't apply pesticides that are going to make people sick.
[06:38.480 --> 06:42.480]  As long as you're not a corrupt piece of shit, I support you growing cannabis your way.
[06:42.480 --> 06:46.480]  That also being said, I grow mostly from bottled nutrients.
[06:46.480 --> 06:53.480]  I run a large cultivation facility where we have lots of plants, lots of lights, lots of work to be done.
[06:53.480 --> 06:58.480]  I am well-versed in working with bottles and synthetic nutrients.
[06:58.480 --> 07:03.480]  On the same hand, I've got a lot of experience using organics and growing organically,
[07:03.480 --> 07:09.480]  but I do not have nearly the amount of experience and knowledge as I have with bottled and synthetic nutrients.
[07:09.480 --> 07:15.480]  So I may seem biased in my debate here, but I'm going to try to play evenly on both sides
[07:15.480 --> 07:18.480]  so I can keep this argument fair for both sides.
[07:18.480 --> 07:22.480]  But I also feel like this shouldn't be too much of an argument because we can all be friends.
[07:22.480 --> 07:25.480]  We're all growing cannabis. I know some people are haters.
[07:25.480 --> 07:28.480]  I know some people have put a lot of time and energy into perfecting their technique,
[07:28.480 --> 07:31.480]  and they feel like they've got some hot shit going on, and they feel like they're special.
[07:31.480 --> 07:34.480]  I'm not going to worry about any of that. I'm not going to play that game right now.
[07:34.480 --> 07:42.480]  I am going to do an unbiased, honest, personal debate between organic versus synthetics when it comes to growing cannabis.
[07:42.480 --> 07:46.480]  So I'm going to press pause. I'm going to actually take a quick dab of this Screamin' Tangerines before I get into it.
[07:46.480 --> 07:50.480]  And when I get back, synthetics versus organics, round one.
[07:52.480 --> 07:58.480]  All right, podcast world, I am back with the ever so pleasant taste of Screamin' Tangerines in my mouth.
[07:59.480 --> 08:02.480]  It's like I just bit into a tangerine. Delicious.
[08:02.480 --> 08:06.480]  All right, let's talk about growing with synthetic or organic nutrients.
[08:06.480 --> 08:10.480]  Now, I said it earlier, a lot of people think that they have some special technique mastered.
[08:10.480 --> 08:14.480]  A lot of people that grow organically, a lot of the guys that grow no-till,
[08:14.480 --> 08:18.480]  a lot of the guys that grow some fancy Korean natural farming sort of method,
[08:18.480 --> 08:22.480]  they seem to be kind of sensitive when it comes to bottled nutrients,
[08:22.480 --> 08:26.480]  and they want to talk trash right away because they say growing with bottles is too easy.
[08:27.480 --> 08:30.480]  Now, sometimes a new grower may need something easy.
[08:30.480 --> 08:33.480]  We don't all have all day to dedicate to growing.
[08:33.480 --> 08:36.480]  Bottled nutrients are easy, so that's good for a beginner.
[08:36.480 --> 08:41.480]  It's good for a hobby grower. It's good for somebody who is fully employed and has a full-time job.
[08:41.480 --> 08:45.480]  It's good for somebody who has a little bit of space and can't have,
[08:45.480 --> 08:48.480]  that doesn't have space for making extra things.
[08:48.480 --> 08:50.480]  Some people don't have a lot of room.
[08:50.480 --> 08:53.480]  So bottled nutrients are good for these types of folks.
[08:53.480 --> 08:56.480]  Bottled nutrients are good for large facilities.
[08:56.480 --> 08:59.480]  Bottled nutrients can be used on all types of grows.
[08:59.480 --> 09:05.480]  For someone to dismiss the idea of growing with synthetic bottled nutrients because it is easy
[09:05.480 --> 09:08.480]  just seems closed-minded and silly to me.
[09:08.480 --> 09:14.480]  Don't let anyone on the internet discourage you because you're trying to grow with synthetic bottled nutrients.
[09:14.480 --> 09:17.480]  It works. It's the most common practice in a large-scale facility,
[09:17.480 --> 09:21.480]  and you're not doing anything wrong as long as you're flushing your product at the end.
[09:21.480 --> 09:24.480]  So, yes, it may be easy, but it's also reliable.
[09:24.480 --> 09:30.480]  Bottled nutrients are reliable, and in most cases, they are available.
[09:30.480 --> 09:33.480]  So I know that whenever I buy a bottle, and I'm just going to pick a bottle,
[09:33.480 --> 09:36.480]  I'm just going to say, what's in front of me? I've got a white jar in front of me.
[09:36.480 --> 09:39.480]  I'm going to say, whenever I buy white jar nutrients, and that's not even a real brand,
[09:39.480 --> 09:44.480]  so I'm not advertising for anybody, I know that there is a certain amount of this product
[09:44.480 --> 09:48.480]  and a certain amount of this product or ingredient inside of that product.
[09:48.480 --> 09:53.480]  And every time I buy it, it should be within a certain range so that my nutrient mixes are consistent.
[09:53.480 --> 09:58.480]  So my product, white jar, should be reliable and available when I need it.
[09:58.480 --> 10:01.480]  It may not be available. That may be a con to you.
[10:01.480 --> 10:05.480]  The bottle that you're trying to get may not be available in your area.
[10:05.480 --> 10:09.480]  You may not have a growth store in your area. You may not be able to go to the growth store.
[10:09.480 --> 10:12.480]  So for guys like that, you may want to lean more toward the organics.
[10:12.480 --> 10:16.480]  If you're in a farming area, people are going to be buying farming shit anyway.
[10:16.480 --> 10:21.480]  All the organic stuff is going to be available. Use that. That may be the way to go for you.
[10:21.480 --> 10:28.480]  But I feel like the bottled nutrients are reliable and available, and almost everyone's got Amazon available to them.
[10:28.480 --> 10:32.480]  So I feel like everybody should be able to get just about any bottled product shipped to them,
[10:32.480 --> 10:35.480]  as long as they can find it on the internet.
[10:35.480 --> 10:41.480]  One of the pros of bottled nutrients is feed charts are easy to follow.
[10:41.480 --> 10:45.480]  No matter what brand of nutrients you're using out there, you can type it in,
[10:45.480 --> 10:47.480]  and there will be a feed chart available for that brand.
[10:47.480 --> 10:50.480]  And then you can adjust that feed chart for your particular plant.
[10:50.480 --> 10:53.480]  But the feed charts are easy to follow.
[10:53.480 --> 10:59.480]  If you're making organics, you've got websites like BuildASoil and places like that.
[10:59.480 --> 11:04.480]  But you're going to have to build a soil, and you're going to have to get all those amendments and things shipped to you,
[11:04.480 --> 11:05.480]  and then you're going to have to mix them.
[11:05.480 --> 11:08.480]  And hopefully you get all the mixes right, and hopefully nothing's too hot.
[11:08.480 --> 11:11.480]  And then once you get it mixed, you're going to have to let it cook,
[11:11.480 --> 11:13.480]  and it's going to have to sit for a little while.
[11:13.480 --> 11:15.480]  So that's one of the cons of working with organics,
[11:15.480 --> 11:20.480]  is that it's not as consistent and it's not as reliable, in my experience and in my opinion.
[11:20.480 --> 11:22.480]  Once you get it dialed in, it will be perfect.
[11:22.480 --> 11:26.480]  But I'm sure that getting it dialed in will take a couple of trials and errors.
[11:26.480 --> 11:30.480]  Now, if you're brand new and you're growing with this soil that you just made,
[11:30.480 --> 11:32.480]  and your plant's messing up, your soil is mixed,
[11:32.480 --> 11:35.480]  and you're going to have a hard time figuring out what's wrong because you're a new grower.
[11:35.480 --> 11:39.480]  And now you've got to figure out what's wrong with the plant and how to fix the soil.
[11:39.480 --> 11:43.480]  Now, if you've got a relationship with the soil, that's not as hard to do.
[11:43.480 --> 11:45.480]  But when you're a brand new grower and you don't know your plants,
[11:45.480 --> 11:49.480]  you don't know your soil as well, this is where bottled nutrients may be able to help.
[11:49.480 --> 11:51.480]  You may look at the plant and you can say,
[11:51.480 --> 11:53.480]  shit, this is wrong. You go to the internet, the internet tells you,
[11:53.480 --> 11:56.480]  or you listen to Ross DeJeff, we figure out what's wrong with your plants.
[11:56.480 --> 12:01.480]  Then you can get the correct bottle and you can treat the plants with that bottle.
[12:01.480 --> 12:05.480]  I know that sounds simple, and that's the way some people need it.
[12:05.480 --> 12:08.480]  You guys that are doing the organics, you've already built that relationship.
[12:08.480 --> 12:11.480]  I'm sure most of you that are doing the organics started with bottles.
[12:11.480 --> 12:15.480]  Like a lot of us start on bottles, then we graduate up to the organics.
[12:15.480 --> 12:19.480]  And that's how you learn to spot the deficiencies so that when you mix up your soil,
[12:19.480 --> 12:23.480]  you can see what was wrong with the plant and you can learn how to fix it by top dressing or mixing in a tea.
[12:23.480 --> 12:26.480]  I also feel like a lot of you guys grow in the organics and no-tills.
[12:26.480 --> 12:29.480]  If you didn't start with bottled nutrients and graduate to the organics,
[12:29.480 --> 12:34.480]  I feel like you started with some sort of horticultural experience in your background and your family
[12:34.480 --> 12:36.480]  is where a lot of you guys learned it.
[12:36.480 --> 12:38.480]  That's what I've noticed is from paying attention.
[12:38.480 --> 12:42.480]  So what I was going to get to, what I was talking about is feed charts are available.
[12:42.480 --> 12:45.480]  That's one of the great pros of growing with bottled nutrients.
[12:45.480 --> 12:48.480]  Feed charts are there. You can Google it. You can print it out.
[12:48.480 --> 12:50.480]  You can post it up on the wall. It's always going to be there.
[12:50.480 --> 12:52.480]  Feed charts are reliable.
[12:52.480 --> 12:57.480]  Grandma and Grandpa's old organics recipes, crazy old man Steve's organic recipe,
[12:57.480 --> 13:00.480]  Mountain Tom's recipe, that shit's going to work if you've got that recipe.
[13:00.480 --> 13:04.480]  If somebody gave you that recipe on how to grow cannabis, on how to mix up things,
[13:04.480 --> 13:07.480]  how to prep things, how to feed things, as long as somebody passed that down to you,
[13:07.480 --> 13:09.480]  but that's not available to everybody.
[13:09.480 --> 13:11.480]  So that's where bottled nutrients come in.
[13:11.480 --> 13:14.480]  Not everybody had somebody in their family to teach them this kind of stuff,
[13:14.480 --> 13:16.480]  or not everybody had it as a passion.
[13:16.480 --> 13:18.480]  So the bottles are good for those folks.
[13:18.480 --> 13:23.480]  Let's see. Let's talk about the cost of bottles versus organics.
[13:23.480 --> 13:30.480]  The cost. One thing about the cost of bottled is you're paying for water to be shipped across the country.
[13:31.480 --> 13:37.480]  So let's just say if you're buying white jar products and that company is in California,
[13:37.480 --> 13:40.480]  and a lot of their stuff that they're sourcing comes from California,
[13:40.480 --> 13:42.480]  it's probably going to come from hopefully states around there,
[13:42.480 --> 13:44.480]  but maybe there's shit they can't get in California.
[13:44.480 --> 13:48.480]  Maybe they have to have part of their ingredients shipped from Massachusetts.
[13:48.480 --> 13:52.480]  So now you've got a pallet of stuff being shipped from Massachusetts to California
[13:52.480 --> 13:56.480]  to get distributed into a bunch of bottles, to get mixed with water,
[13:56.480 --> 14:01.480]  to get back on a truck, to get shipped to a growth store in Colorado so that you can buy it,
[14:01.480 --> 14:05.480]  so that you can drive it to your house, so that you can then add more water to it,
[14:05.480 --> 14:07.480]  and then feed it to your plants.
[14:07.480 --> 14:10.480]  So when you're buying bottled nutrients, you're paying for trucks to drive across the country over and over again,
[14:10.480 --> 14:12.480]  is kind of what I'm getting at.
[14:12.480 --> 14:15.480]  You're paying for people to ship you water. That kind of sucks.
[14:15.480 --> 14:17.480]  You're also paying for plastic bottles.
[14:17.480 --> 14:21.480]  A lot of the organic stuff, sure, some of the organic stuff does come in bottles,
[14:21.480 --> 14:24.480]  but a lot of the organic stuff is being produced by the organic grower.
[14:24.480 --> 14:28.480]  They are making it themselves along with their cannabis garden.
[14:28.480 --> 14:30.480]  So it's a symbiotic grow.
[14:30.480 --> 14:33.480]  They're growing the cover crop in the pot that the cannabis is growing in.
[14:33.480 --> 14:36.480]  They're growing, so it's all happening in one container.
[14:36.480 --> 14:41.480]  There's less packaging, less shipping, and less harm to the environment.
[14:41.480 --> 14:43.480]  But that's something we're going to talk about here in a little bit.
[14:43.480 --> 14:45.480]  So the difference in cost.
[14:45.480 --> 14:48.480]  With bottled nutrients, you're paying for a lot of water.
[14:48.480 --> 14:50.480]  You're paying for a lot of labels.
[14:50.480 --> 14:52.480]  You're paying for a lot of brand names.
[14:52.480 --> 14:55.480]  When it comes to organic amendments, a lot of that stuff comes in a cardboard box.
[14:55.480 --> 14:57.480]  It doesn't have a brand name on it.
[14:57.480 --> 15:00.480]  A lot of it was possibly grown by another local farmer.
[15:00.480 --> 15:02.480]  A lot of it was traded from farmer to farmer.
[15:02.480 --> 15:06.480]  A lot of it was grown, like I said earlier, by the grower that is going to use it.
[15:06.480 --> 15:10.480]  Organics is kind of cheaper because you don't have to pay for anything to be processed.
[15:10.480 --> 15:11.480]  It is what it is.
[15:11.480 --> 15:14.480]  If you're buying bat shit, you are getting bat shit.
[15:14.480 --> 15:16.480]  If you're buying liquid bat shit from a nutrient company,
[15:16.480 --> 15:19.480]  you're probably getting bat shit and water.
[15:19.480 --> 15:22.480]  And then something else that they put in there so that they could write on the label,
[15:22.480 --> 15:24.480]  hey, there's this other cool shit in there.
[15:24.480 --> 15:26.480]  So organics may be a little bit cheaper.
[15:26.480 --> 15:30.480]  But that is probably mostly because you don't have to pay for that advanced nutrients
[15:30.480 --> 15:33.480]  or that botanic care label on your bottle.
[15:33.480 --> 15:36.480]  And you don't have to pay for as much processing of the materials.
[15:36.480 --> 15:38.480]  So that's a little bit on the cost.
[15:38.480 --> 15:42.480]  Let's talk about, I said, the availability of bottles and organics.
[15:42.480 --> 15:45.480]  Earlier I mentioned that if you lived in some places,
[15:45.480 --> 15:50.480]  like if you live in a farming area, you may not have a hydroponic store in your neighborhood.
[15:50.480 --> 15:55.480]  You may not have the hydro warehouse or grow warehouse for a long distance around you.
[15:55.480 --> 15:57.480]  You may have to go to Amazon.
[15:57.480 --> 16:01.480]  But at that farming store, at that garden supply store,
[16:01.480 --> 16:03.480]  or at the whatever you've got in your area,
[16:03.480 --> 16:08.480]  you may have a whole bunch of agricultural and horticultural supplies available to you
[16:08.480 --> 16:12.480]  that you can use to make great organic amendments.
[16:12.480 --> 16:16.480]  I'm sure that you can find everything that Frosty spoke about,
[16:16.480 --> 16:20.480]  either at your local garden supply store, or if you're in that type of area,
[16:20.480 --> 16:24.480]  maybe one of your local farmers has got what you're looking for,
[16:24.480 --> 16:27.480]  and you guys can work out something, put a few bucks in his pocket,
[16:27.480 --> 16:29.480]  maybe return a few buds to his pipe when you're done.
[16:29.480 --> 16:31.480]  You never know what you could work out.
[16:31.480 --> 16:34.480]  And like I said earlier, everybody's got Amazon.
[16:34.480 --> 16:37.480]  So you can get your hands on every nutrient that you can think of.
[16:37.480 --> 16:41.480]  You could probably get your hands on every amendment you could think of somewhere.
[16:41.480 --> 16:43.480]  But if you're going to grow organics,
[16:43.480 --> 16:46.480]  you probably want to source everything as locally as you can.
[16:46.480 --> 16:49.480]  But I get it. That's not always possible.
[16:49.480 --> 16:55.480]  So let's talk about one of the downsides to organics is the extra prep time.
[16:55.480 --> 16:59.480]  If you want to make some soil, if you want to make some teas,
[16:59.480 --> 17:02.480]  almost all of that organic stuff, especially the ferments,
[17:02.480 --> 17:05.480]  those things all take time. You have to plan ahead.
[17:05.480 --> 17:08.480]  So your first grow, you may be out of rhythm.
[17:08.480 --> 17:10.480]  It may take you a couple of grows to get your rhythm down
[17:10.480 --> 17:14.480]  because your teas need to cook for 24 or 48 hours.
[17:14.480 --> 17:18.480]  They need to brew. Your soil needs to cook for like three to six, maybe eight weeks.
[17:18.480 --> 17:20.480]  It depends on what you're putting in there.
[17:20.480 --> 17:25.480]  So all of your organic stuff is going to take more prep, more cook, and more plan time,
[17:25.480 --> 17:27.480]  which means it's also going to take more space.
[17:27.480 --> 17:31.480]  So in my opinion, that's some of the cons of growing organically.
[17:31.480 --> 17:34.480]  Also, one of the things that you don't get as much with bottled nutrients
[17:34.480 --> 17:38.480]  that you do really get when you're growing organically is some stink.
[17:38.480 --> 17:42.480]  A lot of the organic nutrients and a lot of the organic amendments,
[17:42.480 --> 17:45.480]  any of the fermentations, a lot of the compost teas,
[17:45.480 --> 17:49.480]  a lot of the teas you're going to brew, they're going to smell terrible.
[17:49.480 --> 17:52.480]  If you've got a small house or a small space, it's going to stink it up.
[17:52.480 --> 17:55.480]  So it's going to take more time. It's going to take a little more space,
[17:55.480 --> 17:59.480]  and it might stink a little bit more if you're using organics.
[17:59.480 --> 18:02.480]  If you're a weirdo like me, you may enjoy some of those funky-ass smells,
[18:02.480 --> 18:05.480]  and it may be the highlight of your day sometimes.
[18:05.480 --> 18:08.480]  So it may take you a little more time if you're going to make teas
[18:08.480 --> 18:11.480]  and if you're going to make your own soils and things like that.
[18:11.480 --> 18:15.480]  But if that's what you want to do, that's another thing to do.
[18:15.480 --> 18:17.480]  If you have more stuff, if you want to be more involved in your garden,
[18:17.480 --> 18:20.480]  that is a great way to do it.
[18:20.480 --> 18:23.480]  So you have to pre-plan your organics. You have to be on top of it.
[18:23.480 --> 18:27.480]  You have to have your... if you're going to make your own pesticides,
[18:27.480 --> 18:30.480]  if you're going to make your own sprays, you have to get on top of those
[18:30.480 --> 18:32.480]  way before it's time to need them.
[18:32.480 --> 18:35.480]  One of the good things about bottled pesticides and bottled nutrients
[18:35.480 --> 18:38.480]  is if you see a problem, you can walk over there and grab that bottle
[18:38.480 --> 18:41.480]  and shake it up, and you can mix it, and you can apply it.
[18:41.480 --> 18:44.480]  There's no waiting. But it's also a dangerous pesticide.
[18:44.480 --> 18:47.480]  So it's got its pros and cons.
[18:47.480 --> 18:50.480]  You've got to pre-plan your organics a little bit more
[18:50.480 --> 18:53.480]  than I feel like you've got to pre-plan your synthetics.
[18:53.480 --> 18:56.480]  Also, there's that extra space for the extra...
[18:56.480 --> 18:59.480]  the trash can that you're brewing, or the five-gallon buckets
[18:59.480 --> 19:02.480]  that you're putting your teas in, your jars that you're making ferments in.
[19:02.480 --> 19:05.480]  Sometimes that takes a little extra space.
[19:05.480 --> 19:08.480]  Not a whole bunch, because you'd have bottled nutrients anyway.
[19:08.480 --> 19:11.480]  But if you're making things... like we heard Frosty say,
[19:11.480 --> 19:14.480]  that he grinds stuff up real small. He puts some stuff in a blender.
[19:14.480 --> 19:17.480]  So he's already got a grinder and a blender. I don't have that in my grow.
[19:17.480 --> 19:20.480]  So that would be two more things that I would have to add.
[19:20.480 --> 19:23.480]  So there's a little bit more extra equipment. But it'll be worth it
[19:23.480 --> 19:26.480]  because you don't have to ship a bunch of bottles across the country.
[19:26.480 --> 19:29.480]  So there are pros and cons to both of these.
[19:29.480 --> 19:32.480]  So with organics, it's much easier to reuse and recycle your soil.
[19:32.480 --> 19:35.480]  Especially if you're going no-till.
[19:35.480 --> 19:38.480]  So that means less trash, you guys.
[19:38.480 --> 19:41.480]  The less stuff you have to throw away for our environment, the better.
[19:41.480 --> 19:44.480]  We're going to get to that part here pretty soon.
[19:44.480 --> 19:47.480]  So it's a lot easier to recondition and recycle and reuse soil
[19:47.480 --> 19:50.480]  that was grown in organically, especially the no-till style.
[19:50.480 --> 19:53.480]  You just pull a plant out and go right back in it.
[19:53.480 --> 19:56.480]  So if you try to recycle and reuse your synthetic or your soil
[19:56.480 --> 19:59.480]  that was fed with synthetic nutrients, it may be too hot.
[19:59.480 --> 20:02.480]  There may be stuff stuck in there. Hopefully, yes, you did flush.
[20:02.480 --> 20:05.480]  But sometimes some stuff will stick in there.
[20:05.480 --> 20:08.480]  I wouldn't recommend regrowing in soil that you used synthetic nutrients in.
[20:08.480 --> 20:11.480]  You could throw that outside and put that in the veggie garden outside
[20:11.480 --> 20:14.480]  next summer or do something like that.
[20:14.480 --> 20:17.480]  Let it turn outside in the dirt. Maybe mix it with some fresh dirt
[20:17.480 --> 20:20.480]  with a bunch of organics. But I wouldn't go straight back into it.
[20:20.480 --> 20:23.480]  It needs some love. It needs some reconditioning.
[20:23.480 --> 20:26.480]  And it may be too hot and it may be kind of funky from having all of those
[20:26.480 --> 20:29.480]  synthetic nutrients poured through it, even if you did flush it.
[20:29.480 --> 20:32.480]  I just don't like reusing it. I don't know. I would mix it with some fresh dirt at least.
[20:32.480 --> 20:35.480]  But I would recommend putting it outdoors.
[20:35.480 --> 20:38.480]  Let the sun bake all that crap out of it.
[20:38.480 --> 20:41.480]  Let the earth do what it does to it and fix it for you.
[20:41.480 --> 20:44.480]  And just get some fresh dirt for inside.
[20:44.480 --> 20:47.480]  Let's see. When you're growing with organics, it seems to be more forgiving in my opinion.
[20:47.480 --> 20:50.480]  You're not pouring concentrated nutrients into your plant.
[20:50.480 --> 20:53.480]  So if you make a little bit of a mistake, if you over measure or under measure,
[20:53.480 --> 20:56.480]  I feel like organics gives you a lot more leeway.
[20:56.480 --> 20:59.480]  You're not pouring, like I said, concentrated chemicals
[20:59.480 --> 21:02.480]  into the root zone, feeding your plant
[21:02.480 --> 21:05.480]  an overdose really easily.
[21:05.480 --> 21:08.480]  It seems like the plants kind of know what to take and what to absorb
[21:08.480 --> 21:11.480]  and what to eat a little more when you're going organically.
[21:11.480 --> 21:14.480]  When you're going synthetically, you're kind of force feeding them.
[21:14.480 --> 21:17.480]  Everything is right there. Everything is buffered. They suck it all up.
[21:17.480 --> 21:20.480]  And they can overfeed themselves very easily.
[21:20.480 --> 21:23.480]  Also, it's very easy to get a salt buildup problem
[21:23.480 --> 21:26.480]  with synthetic nutrients.
[21:26.480 --> 21:29.480]  If your pH gets off a little bit or you start getting a salt buildup,
[21:29.480 --> 21:32.480]  you start getting a lockout, your plants start changing colors,
[21:32.480 --> 21:35.480]  shit starts going bad really quickly, that's much less likely
[21:35.480 --> 21:38.480]  when you're growing with organics.
[21:38.480 --> 21:41.480]  Don't try to challenge me and go crazy and feed your plants a bunch of ridiculous organic shit
[21:42.480 --> 21:45.480]  because you can cause problems with the organics.
[21:45.480 --> 21:48.480]  I'm just saying it's a little bit more forgiving.
[21:48.480 --> 21:51.480]  Now since I said that, I kind of triggered myself into a whole other rant.
[21:51.480 --> 21:54.480]  You guys, don't be sold by the word
[21:54.480 --> 21:57.480]  organic.
[21:57.480 --> 22:00.480]  Organic has become such a buzzword lately.
[22:00.480 --> 22:03.480]  They can print organic on a package and put it next to a package that doesn't say organic on it.
[22:03.480 --> 22:06.480]  They can be the same damn thing and I guarantee you the one with the word organic
[22:06.480 --> 22:09.480]  on it is going to sell just because of the word organic printed on the package.
[22:10.480 --> 22:13.480]  Water is organic but they don't print it on the bottles.
[22:13.480 --> 22:16.480]  I bet if I printed it on one bottle you would buy that one instead.
[22:16.480 --> 22:19.480]  I bet if I printed gluten free, organic, dairy free, sodium free,
[22:19.480 --> 22:22.480]  if I put that shit on there and didn't put it on the other one,
[22:22.480 --> 22:25.480]  the bottle next to it would sell.
[22:25.480 --> 22:28.480]  Be careful being sold by the word organic.
[22:28.480 --> 22:31.480]  Cyanide is organic you guys.
[22:31.480 --> 22:34.480]  Cyanide can fucking kill you and it's organic.
[22:34.480 --> 22:37.480]  Keep that in mind.
[22:38.480 --> 22:41.480]  Just because people say their plants are organic doesn't mean they're perfectly safe.
[22:41.480 --> 22:44.480]  It doesn't mean they're harmless.
[22:44.480 --> 22:47.480]  Don't be sold by buzzwords.
[22:47.480 --> 22:50.480]  I'm not just talking about cannabis.
[22:50.480 --> 22:53.480]  I'm talking about in every product you consume,
[22:53.480 --> 22:56.480]  every product you rub on your body, any product you put on your face.
[22:56.480 --> 22:59.480]  Read.
[22:59.480 --> 23:02.480]  Organic on the label does not mean it's all organic.
[23:02.480 --> 23:05.480]  Organic doesn't mean that a product is specifically safer for you.
[23:06.480 --> 23:09.480]  I'm going to give you a quick tip on this list.
[23:09.480 --> 23:12.480]  Read about nicotine sulfate.
[23:12.480 --> 23:15.480]  It's a neurotoxin.
[23:15.480 --> 23:18.480]  When they tested it on humans, it killed them.
[23:18.480 --> 23:21.480]  It's organic.
[23:21.480 --> 23:24.480]  It's also approved in organic farming.
[23:24.480 --> 23:27.480]  Before you are too mesmerized by the word organic,
[23:27.480 --> 23:30.480]  keep in mind that things like cyanide
[23:30.480 --> 23:33.480]  and nicotine sulfate are organic and they can kill you.
[23:34.480 --> 23:37.480]  Let's get back on track.
[23:37.480 --> 23:40.480]  Another thing I want to talk about is monoammonium phosphate.
[23:40.480 --> 23:43.480]  A lot of the bloom boosters you buy,
[23:43.480 --> 23:46.480]  especially powdered bloom boosters,
[23:46.480 --> 23:49.480]  there's one in particular that I'm not sure I want to say the name of it,
[23:49.480 --> 23:52.480]  but it is mostly monoammonium phosphate.
[23:52.480 --> 23:55.480]  That is mostly what the whole product is.
[23:55.480 --> 23:58.480]  Monoammonium phosphate is formed when
[23:58.480 --> 24:01.480]  a solution of phosphoric acid is added to ammonia
[24:01.480 --> 24:04.480]  and the solution is distinctly acidic.
[24:04.480 --> 24:07.480]  That is largely used in agricultural fertilizers.
[24:07.480 --> 24:10.480]  That information came from Wikipedia.
[24:10.480 --> 24:13.480]  I knew that already.
[24:13.480 --> 24:16.480]  Oftentimes, cannabis grown with a lot of
[24:16.480 --> 24:19.480]  monoammonium phosphate has been proven to give people
[24:19.480 --> 24:22.480]  a headache and have adverse health reactions
[24:22.480 --> 24:25.480]  to people who already had a compromised immune system
[24:25.480 --> 24:28.480]  or were already experiencing a medical condition.
[24:28.480 --> 24:31.480]  If you are growing with synthetic nutrients,
[24:31.480 --> 24:34.480]  check your bloom boosters and see if you are applying
[24:34.480 --> 24:37.480]  monoammonium phosphate or
[24:37.480 --> 24:40.480]  dioammonium phosphates. MAP and DAP are commonly
[24:40.480 --> 24:43.480]  used in fertilizers, but I'm starting to think
[24:43.480 --> 24:46.480]  they should not be used in things we smoke.
[24:46.480 --> 24:49.480]  Make sure your fertilizers don't have monoammonium phosphate
[24:49.480 --> 24:52.480]  or dioammonium phosphates. If they do,
[24:52.480 --> 24:55.480]  maybe consider switching bloom boosters. Maybe consider
[24:55.480 --> 24:58.480]  switching to organics.
[25:25.480 --> 25:28.480]  All organic, no shit.
[25:28.480 --> 25:31.480]  All organic, no shit.
[25:31.480 --> 25:34.480]  All organic, no shit.
[25:34.480 --> 25:37.480]  All organic, no shit.
[25:37.480 --> 25:40.480]  We've talked about MAP and DAP. We've talked about
[25:40.480 --> 25:43.480]  organic growing. Let's talk about one thing
[25:43.480 --> 25:46.480]  that you organic, non-bottled growers are going to have
[25:46.480 --> 25:49.480]  the advantage on. Here's one thing that most of us don't think about.
[25:49.480 --> 25:52.480]  The end of the fucking world.
[25:52.480 --> 25:55.480]  Shit's going to go wrong. There will not be an electrical grid.
[25:55.480 --> 25:58.480]  There will not be a grow store. There will not be Amazon
[25:58.480 --> 26:01.480]  to deliver your shit to your front door.
[26:01.480 --> 26:04.480]  If we have one thing, we can still grow.
[26:04.480 --> 26:07.480]  If we've got the sun and maybe just a nice patch of dirt,
[26:07.480 --> 26:10.480]  we can still grow cannabis.
[26:10.480 --> 26:13.480]  You guys that are growing organically,
[26:13.480 --> 26:16.480]  when the end of the world comes, you guys are going to win.
[26:16.480 --> 26:19.480]  There will be no grow store, no feed chart, no Google.
[26:19.480 --> 26:22.480]  You guys are going to have the advantage then.
[26:22.480 --> 26:25.480]  That's one of the advantages of growing organically.
[26:25.480 --> 26:28.480]  More of the great benefits and advantages of growing organically
[26:28.480 --> 26:31.480]  are the sustainability.
[26:31.480 --> 26:34.480]  Us guys growing out of bottled nutrients,
[26:34.480 --> 26:37.480]  we're just sucking up resources and eventually the resources
[26:37.480 --> 26:40.480]  we're sucking up are going to run out.
[26:40.480 --> 26:43.480]  We're not able to provide ourselves with the amounts of products
[26:43.480 --> 26:46.480]  that we need because we're not making it ourselves.
[26:46.480 --> 26:49.480]  We're not making it for a manufacturer, distributor,
[26:49.480 --> 26:52.480]  a vendor, whatever. There are several steps in our chain.
[26:52.480 --> 26:55.480]  It's not sustainable, you guys.
[26:55.480 --> 26:58.480]  In my opinion, I don't think my grow,
[26:58.480 --> 27:01.480]  I've got a large commercial medical grow that I'm in charge of
[27:01.480 --> 27:04.480]  and I do not think that I could run it organically
[27:04.480 --> 27:07.480]  with my level of experience and produce
[27:07.480 --> 27:10.480]  the quality and quantity and consistency
[27:10.480 --> 27:13.480]  that we do with synthetic nutrients.
[27:13.480 --> 27:16.480]  On a larger scale, like what I'm doing indoors,
[27:16.480 --> 27:19.480]  I think the bottled synthetic nutrients are the way to go.
[27:19.480 --> 27:22.480]  If I were in a greenhouse or outdoors, I may change my mind on it.
[27:22.480 --> 27:25.480]  But so far, I think that the application for indoors
[27:25.480 --> 27:28.480]  is a synthetic environment. I think as soon as I go outdoors,
[27:28.480 --> 27:31.480]  I would switch to the organics. That's my opinion on that one.
[27:31.480 --> 27:34.480]  But when it comes to sustainability, I think you guys doing the organics,
[27:34.480 --> 27:37.480]  you're doing the right thing. You can make your own stuff,
[27:37.480 --> 27:40.480]  you can recycle your own dirt, you are using,
[27:40.480 --> 27:43.480]  you are recycling your food waste, you are doing positive things for the environment,
[27:43.480 --> 27:46.480]  which is what I want to move into next. The bottled nutrient guys
[27:46.480 --> 27:49.480]  are ruining the environment slowly. We're shipping bottles
[27:49.480 --> 27:52.480]  of water back and forth across the country. We're wasting a lot of stuff.
[27:52.480 --> 27:55.480]  That's not good.
[27:55.480 --> 27:58.480]  The reliability for large scale,
[27:58.480 --> 28:01.480]  the ease for a new grower, the ease for a hobby grower,
[28:01.480 --> 28:04.480]  those are the things that make bottled nutrients worth it. But the long-term
[28:04.480 --> 28:07.480]  environmental costs, our carbon footprint,
[28:07.480 --> 28:10.480]  that's what would make switching to organics worth it for me.
[28:10.480 --> 28:13.480]  But since I run a large scale production facility that is based
[28:13.480 --> 28:16.480]  on numbers, and if I don't produce those numbers,
[28:16.480 --> 28:19.480]  there are consequences. I cannot take the risks
[28:19.480 --> 28:22.480]  of switching to a synthetic regimen and having to relearn everything.
[28:22.480 --> 28:25.480]  I've got our bottled system figured out very well.
[28:25.480 --> 28:28.480]  I've got it dialed in. We're pulling great lab tests.
[28:28.480 --> 28:31.480]  We're pulling great weights. Our patients are happy.
[28:31.480 --> 28:34.480]  The owners are happy. I'm happy.
[28:34.480 --> 28:37.480]  I couldn't make the switch right now. If we started some shit outdoor,
[28:37.480 --> 28:40.480]  I would hire a guy like Frosty or a guy like Sean to come fully
[28:40.480 --> 28:43.480]  educate me or a guy like Jesse to come fully educate me on the outdoor
[28:43.480 --> 28:46.480]  setups. And then I would be a black belt
[28:46.480 --> 28:49.480]  outdoor grower just like those guys.
[28:49.480 --> 28:52.480]  So let's wrap it up here, you guys. Let's talk about, in summation,
[28:52.480 --> 28:55.480]  let's talk about the pros and cons of bottled versus
[28:55.480 --> 28:58.480]  synthetics. I think some of the pros of growing
[28:58.480 --> 29:01.480]  from organic nutrients is
[29:01.480 --> 29:04.480]  the sustainability, the positive
[29:04.480 --> 29:07.480]  effect on the environment, the recycling that we're doing,
[29:07.480 --> 29:10.480]  the long term. I think that's great. The clean
[29:10.480 --> 29:13.480]  medicine. I think that that is a great thing. The ability to make
[29:13.480 --> 29:16.480]  your own nutrients. I think that's a great thing. Some of the
[29:16.480 --> 29:19.480]  cons of growing organically. There's a lot of extra prep
[29:19.480 --> 29:22.480]  work. It's going to stink. You may need
[29:22.480 --> 29:25.480]  more space, and it's definitely going to take more
[29:25.480 --> 29:28.480]  planning and more time. Now, some of the
[29:28.480 --> 29:31.480]  pros of growing with bottled nutrients.
[29:31.480 --> 29:34.480]  They are available, and they are reliable.
[29:34.480 --> 29:37.480]  Anybody with enough time to mix up some nutrients and read a feed chart
[29:37.480 --> 29:40.480]  should be able to work a garden ran off of bottled nutrients.
[29:40.480 --> 29:43.480]  It is fairly easy. It is easy if
[29:43.480 --> 29:46.480]  you're a new grower, if you're a hobby grower, if you're somebody growing in a closet,
[29:46.480 --> 29:49.480]  it's easier. If you're running a large scale facility,
[29:49.480 --> 29:52.480]  it's still fairly easy to mix up a large amount of nutrients,
[29:52.480 --> 29:55.480]  pH it, feed it to the plant. It's reliable,
[29:55.480 --> 29:58.480]  and it's consistent, and it is a great start. It is a good way
[29:58.480 --> 30:01.480]  to mix up a batch of nutrients and start
[30:01.480 --> 30:04.480]  learning your plants. And then if you want to sway away from that
[30:04.480 --> 30:07.480]  and go organic in the future, you've got a good
[30:07.480 --> 30:10.480]  foundation. You've learned about the plants, you've learned about growing,
[30:10.480 --> 30:13.480]  and then you can learn how to make your own stuff and make the switch. So some of the
[30:13.480 --> 30:16.480]  cons of growing with bottles.
[30:16.480 --> 30:19.480]  You have to pay money to ship them. You have
[30:19.480 --> 30:22.480]  to dispose of a bunch of bottles. That's one of the shitty things.
[30:22.480 --> 30:25.480]  Where are you going to put them? If you don't live in an
[30:25.480 --> 30:28.480]  illegal state where you can grow, you have to hide those bottles when you throw them
[30:28.480 --> 30:31.480]  away. Nobody can see your advanced nutrients big bud,
[30:31.480 --> 30:34.480]  or you're going to get in trouble. That's going to suck. Also,
[30:34.480 --> 30:37.480]  look out for MAP and DAP if you're growing synthetically. Things like that
[30:37.480 --> 30:40.480]  will cause you problems. You have to flush with both.
[30:40.480 --> 30:43.480]  People think you don't have to flush if you're growing organically.
[30:43.480 --> 30:46.480]  Unless you're growing no-till, you're going to need
[30:46.480 --> 30:49.480]  some flush time, or it will affect the way your final product
[30:49.480 --> 30:52.480]  burns. Clean out that excess silicate. Clean out that
[30:52.480 --> 30:55.480]  excess whatever. Get it out of there. All that excess nitrogen.
[30:55.480 --> 30:58.480]  Get it out. Make your plants burn and taste a little bit better.
[30:58.480 --> 31:01.480]  So, let's wrap up the friendly debate
[31:01.480 --> 31:04.480]  about organics vs. synthetics by saying, I feel like
[31:04.480 --> 31:07.480]  bottle nutrients is a great way to start if you're a new
[31:07.480 --> 31:10.480]  grower. Start off with the bottles. Get a good relationship
[31:10.480 --> 31:13.480]  with the plants, with the rhythms of the plant. Learn how to grow.
[31:13.480 --> 31:16.480]  Learn how to get a few grows under your belt.
[31:16.480 --> 31:19.480]  Learn how to grow. Learn how to grow from seed.
[31:19.480 --> 31:22.480]  Learn how to spot males. Learn how to take clones. Learn how to
[31:22.480 --> 31:25.480]  lollipop. Learn how to defoliate. Learn how to crack the stems
[31:25.480 --> 31:28.480]  to make more productive plants. Learn how to trellis things down.
[31:28.480 --> 31:31.480]  Learn canopy control. Get stuff like that dialed in.
[31:31.480 --> 31:34.480]  Become a good grower. And then once you start understanding the
[31:34.480 --> 31:37.480]  plants, once you start being able to identify deficiencies
[31:37.480 --> 31:40.480]  and learning things to do to increase your yields, start
[31:40.480 --> 31:43.480]  finding ways to dial back the bottles and replace those bottles
[31:43.480 --> 31:46.480]  with some organics. And make the switch. Graduate
[31:46.480 --> 31:49.480]  from bottles into organics and
[31:49.480 --> 31:52.480]  become a black belt that way.
[31:52.480 --> 31:55.480]  And don't forget, when the end of the world comes, you guys, you're only
[31:55.480 --> 31:58.480]  going to have the bottles that you've got. And once you run out, those will be
[31:58.480 --> 32:01.480]  gone. You're going to have to learn how to do it like all the farmers do,
[32:01.480 --> 32:04.480]  just like the organic guys. Alright, now let's stop being
[32:04.480 --> 32:07.480]  uh, let's stop bickering with each other over organics, over synthetics.
[32:07.480 --> 32:10.480]  They all have their place. They all have their purpose.
[32:10.480 --> 32:13.480]  Everybody can grow the way that they want. We are all
[32:13.480 --> 32:16.480]  cannabis soldiers. We are all cannabis growers. We are a community.
[32:16.480 --> 32:19.480]  Let's quit arguing. Let's quit bickering. Let's raise
[32:19.480 --> 32:22.480]  each other up. Let's do it right, you guys. We're bringing ourselves
[32:22.480 --> 32:25.480]  out of the dark ages. We don't have to hide anymore. There's no reason
[32:25.480 --> 32:28.480]  to be weird. There's no reason to be sketchy. We can talk about this.
[32:28.480 --> 32:31.480]  This is a, it's actually
[32:31.480 --> 32:34.480]  an industry now. We don't have to be assholes. We don't have to act like we're
[32:34.480 --> 32:37.480]  artists doing some secretive shit. You're not. You're growing cannabis. It's a fucking
[32:37.480 --> 32:40.480]  plant. You guys can all learn as much as I do about, as I know
[32:40.480 --> 32:43.480]  about cannabis just by reading and studying and doing it. It's all you
[32:43.480 --> 32:46.480]  have to do. So, let's not be dicks to each other.
[32:46.480 --> 32:49.480]  Let's not act like we're all the Wizard of Oz or something because
[32:49.480 --> 32:52.480]  we're not. We're growing plants. Nature was doing it long
[32:52.480 --> 32:55.480]  before you got involved and nature had it fucking mastered.
[32:55.480 --> 32:58.480]  You're just, you're just facilitating. You're just giving it a little place to do it
[32:58.480 --> 33:01.480]  and you're kind of getting in the way. So, stop acting like you're a Jedi.
[33:01.480 --> 33:04.480]  Stop acting like you're a ninja. We're all just pot growers
[33:04.480 --> 33:07.480]  playing with some plants. Alright. So, we're all one now.
[33:07.480 --> 33:10.480]  The no-till guys, the bottle guys, the commercial
[33:10.480 --> 33:13.480]  guys, the closet guys, the seed breeders, the
[33:13.480 --> 33:16.480]  pollen chuckers, the guys that kill plants, the brown thumbs,
[33:16.480 --> 33:19.480]  the green thumbs, the guys that can't figure out how to water clones
[33:19.480 --> 33:22.480]  to save their lives, the guys that can't cure bud to save their lives, the guys
[33:22.480 --> 33:25.480]  that cure bud like a Jedi, the guys that cut clones just by looking
[33:25.480 --> 33:28.480]  at them. We're all equal because we're all cannabis growers and we're all
[33:28.480 --> 33:31.480]  coming out of the dark ages to the green ages together. So, let's be
[33:31.480 --> 33:34.480]  equal. Alright. No more bitching.
[33:34.480 --> 33:37.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, I feel like that scream in Tangerine Dab put me on a rant.

[34:49.480 --> 34:52.480]  over. Big shout out to Bagsy Jesse, by the way. I owe Bagsy Jesse
[34:52.480 --> 34:55.480]  a shout out. He contributed some funds for some bottled waters
[34:55.480 --> 34:58.480]  and such. Big thanks for that. But, you guys,
[34:58.480 --> 35:01.480]  if you do contribute to Patreon, that's what I will use the money for.
[35:01.480 --> 35:04.480]  I'll buy new microphone covers. I need another microphone stand. The one for
[35:04.480 --> 35:07.480]  one of our guests is getting a little limp. I'll get a little Viagra for that
[35:07.480 --> 35:10.480]  microphone stand so it stands up. I also pay for the
[35:10.480 --> 35:13.480]  web hosting. I think I already said that. But if anything goes wrong with the
[35:13.480 --> 35:16.480]  technical gear, your Patreon contributions are used
[35:16.480 --> 35:19.480]  to replace the equipment and keep the equipment updated. It pays
[35:19.480 --> 35:22.480]  for my WiFi. Stuff like that. It just helps me out. So, I do
[35:22.480 --> 35:25.480]  appreciate it if you'd like to contribute. Patreon.com
[35:25.480 --> 35:28.480]  slash GrowFromYourHeart. Also, big thank you to everybody
[35:28.480 --> 35:31.480]  who has been contributing to Patreon. A lot of people started off
[35:31.480 --> 35:34.480]  sending me $1. A lot of those folks have upgraded their
[35:34.480 --> 35:37.480]  subscription to a $4.20 contribution every month.
[35:37.480 --> 35:40.480]  I want to make sure you guys know that I notice that
[35:40.480 --> 35:43.480]  and I truly appreciate it. So, thank you for all of the Patreon
[35:43.480 --> 35:46.480]  support. Also, don't forget to support the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[35:46.480 --> 35:49.480]  Make sure you guys check out DankSeed.store
[35:49.480 --> 35:52.480]  and send them your support. Let them know that you listen to the
[35:52.480 --> 35:55.480]  Grow From Your Heart podcast. I want to thank everybody for listening
[35:55.480 --> 35:58.480]  to this episode. I look forward to all of the interaction. I'll be back
[35:58.480 --> 36:01.480]  Thursday with the long throwback Thursday episode and then of course
[36:01.480 --> 36:04.480]  I'll be back Monday with the fresh new episode.
[36:04.480 --> 36:07.480]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friends in the Colorado Reggae
[36:07.480 --> 36:10.480]  Unit for letting me sit in with them last weekend. And until next time,
[36:10.480 --> 36:13.480]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[36:13.480 --> 36:47.070]  6'6 above sea level
[36:47.070 --> 36:50.070]  I grab the mic because I like to take it to another mental level
[36:50.070 --> 36:54.850]  The big sound from underground another pirate station
[36:54.850 --> 36:57.850]  We bring the truth to places truth is never heard before
[36:57.850 --> 37:00.850]  We bring the sound communication of our tribal war
[37:00.850 --> 37:03.850]  Dark vision fly by helicopters in the night
[37:03.850 --> 37:06.850]  Triangulation of our station in the fight
[37:06.850 --> 37:09.850]  Straight from the base deep down low precision
[37:09.850 --> 37:12.850]  High crime treason we broadcast in sedition
[37:12.850 --> 37:15.850]  Commandeering airways from unknown positions
[37:15.850 --> 37:18.850]  Live and direct we come whenever pre-recorded
[37:18.850 --> 37:21.850]  With information that will never be recorded
[37:21.850 --> 37:24.850]  Disregard the mainstream media distorted
[37:24.850 --> 37:27.850]  We come and listen and support it
[37:27.850 --> 37:30.850]  Live and direct we come and never pre-recorded
[37:30.850 --> 37:33.850]  With information that will never be reported
[37:33.850 --> 37:36.850]  Disregard the mainstream media distorted
[37:36.850 --> 37:39.850]  We come and listen and support it
[37:42.850 --> 37:50.450]  Don't take no prisoners if you can't afford to feed none.
[37:50.450 --> 37:52.850]  Don't start no fights if you cannot predict the outcome.
[37:52.850 --> 37:55.450]  Don't make donations where you cannot get your dough back.
[37:55.450 --> 37:58.250]  Fuck the apathetic bullshitters, send them all your Prozac.
[37:58.250 --> 38:02.650]  I will not climb into your telephone tree and hell no you cannot put me on hold.
[38:02.650 --> 38:05.650]  It's the same reporting message you been saying all along.
[38:05.650 --> 38:08.650]  Keep handing us the Bible while you walking off with all the gold.
[38:08.650 --> 38:11.050]  The bureaucratic office sends you merry-go-round.
[38:11.050 --> 38:13.650]  While the KKK police is tweaked by blood hounding.
[38:13.650 --> 38:16.250]  Interest on the credit card just keeps on compounding.
[38:16.250 --> 38:19.050]  But the FCC can never shut this pirate sound down.
[38:19.050 --> 38:21.650]  Live and direct, we come un-never pre-recorded.
[38:21.650 --> 38:24.250]  With information that will never be reported.
[38:24.250 --> 38:26.850]  Disregard the mainstream, media distorted.
[38:26.850 --> 38:29.450]  Woof, woof, we come un-listener supported.
[38:29.450 --> 38:32.050]  Live and direct, we come un-never pre-recorded.
[38:32.050 --> 38:34.650]  With information that will never be reported.
[38:34.650 --> 38:37.250]  Disregard the mainstream, media distorted.
[38:37.250 --> 38:39.850]  Woof, woof, we come un-listener supported.
[38:39.850 --> 38:42.050]  Live and direct, we come un-never pre-recorded.
[38:42.050 --> 38:44.850]  With information that will never be reported.
[38:44.850 --> 38:47.450]  Disregard the mainstream, media distorted.
[38:47.450 --> 38:49.850]  Woof, woof, we come un-listener supported.
[38:49.850 --> 38:52.450]  Live and direct, we come un-never pre-recorded.
[38:52.450 --> 38:55.250]  With information that will never be reported.
[38:55.250 --> 38:57.650]  Disregard the mainstream, media distorted.
[38:57.650 --> 39:00.850]  Woof, woof, we come un-listener supported.
[39:00.850 --> 39:06.850]  It's like you're passing through the woods
[39:06.850 --> 39:09.850]  You're down on your feet, you're in the woods
[39:09.850 --> 39:14.850]  You're a wild thing, you're beautiful
[39:14.850 --> 39:17.850]  You're a wild thing, you're beautiful
[39:17.850 --> 39:22.850]  You're dancing, you're dancing, you're beautiful
[39:22.850 --> 39:54.320]  You're a wild thing, you're beautiful
[39:54.320 --> 39:57.320]  You're a wild thing, you're beautiful
