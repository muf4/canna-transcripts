[00:46.040 --> 00:51.720]  by talking about what I'm smoking. Today, I've been taking dabs of Blackberry Banana
[00:51.720 --> 00:56.900]  Kush Live Batter from our friends at Apothecary Farms on the package. The label says this
[00:56.900 --> 01:05.920]  contains 68.4% THC and 77.9% total cannabinoids. This stuff gets me stoned, but my favorite
[01:05.920 --> 01:10.080]  part is that flavor and aroma. I'm going to crack it open right now and give it a good
[01:10.080 --> 01:17.460]  smell. It's like Blackberry Jam. It has definitely got that funky Blackberry sweet tartness going
[01:17.460 --> 01:22.840]  on. Then when I dab it, that Blackberry hits you first, then you get that banana flavor
[01:22.840 --> 01:27.960]  in the end. And I think it is really delicious. The banana is subtle, but it is just enough.
[01:27.960 --> 01:32.880]  And obviously it has got me stoned and rambly. So this is great podcast concentrates. I've
[01:32.880 --> 01:37.840]  smoked most of the jar. I've probably got one fat dab left. So I do approve. Big shout
[01:37.840 --> 01:44.800]  out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the Blackberry Banana Kush Batter. All right,
[01:44.800 --> 01:48.260]  ladies and gentlemen, I do have a couple of great emails lined up for this episode.
[01:48.260 --> 01:52.580]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few of the folks who support the show
[01:52.580 --> 01:57.580]  on Patreon. I've got a giant dab packed up for everybody who supports the show. Let's

[02:51.140 --> 02:54.480]  the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen and I did
[02:54.480 --> 02:59.620]  include a link in the show notes to make it easy for all of my stoned friends. Thank you
[02:59.620 --> 03:04.180]  guys for all of the continued support. If you're watching on video, you may notice I've
[03:04.180 --> 03:09.140]  got this new fancy earpiece. I'm not using the giant earphones today, the giant headphones,
[03:09.140 --> 03:12.800]  kind of getting adjusted to this. It sounds different to me. So excuse me if I do sound
[03:12.800 --> 03:16.960]  kind of off a couple of times. I've got one ear with a mic one ear with the earbud in
[03:16.960 --> 03:21.440]  it one ears open. That's new to me. Feels different. Excuse me if I sound funny. Just
[03:21.440 --> 03:25.080]  playing with new gear. I'm gonna get a lapel mic make the videos a little bit better. Thank
[03:25.080 --> 03:28.940]  you guys if you haven't paid attention yet. I've been making videos most of the new podcasts
[03:28.940 --> 03:32.720]  are available on a video platform you can find us on YouTube. Make sure you check out
[03:32.720 --> 03:37.440]  the videos. If you're not able to watch on YouTube, don't feel bad. It's basically me
[03:37.440 --> 03:42.340]  staring into a screen and Mike staring into a screen and us having a chat or just my pretty
[03:42.340 --> 03:46.560]  face smiling at a screen. What's up guys, thanks for watching. Let's move forward. Let's
[03:46.560 --> 03:51.140]  keep this show on track here. Let's not get too far lost. I've got a couple of good notes
[03:51.140 --> 03:56.480]  I wrote down in really big letters, the letters led you guys I was sent some lights from our
[03:56.480 --> 04:00.360]  friends at black sale market big shout out to my good friend Keith. He makes amazing
[04:00.360 --> 04:05.740]  lights. He's a fucking well spoken well educated dude. And his product is rock solid. I've
[04:05.740 --> 04:10.400]  been running his lights for a few I don't remember exactly how long the plants are in
[04:10.400 --> 04:14.900]  three gallon pots. Now they've been transplanted. They've spent their entire lives under these
[04:14.900 --> 04:20.280]  LEDs and they look amazing. They are short they are squat. They're stout. They're very
[04:20.280 --> 04:25.340]  compact and the node spacing from these LEDs is very tight. There's not a lot of distance
[04:25.340 --> 04:30.900]  between branches and node spacing. There's a lot of very healthy and vigorous leaf growth.
[04:30.900 --> 04:36.000]  So I'm impressed so far with the performance of my Canon LEDs. I have two in a five by
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.380]  five tent and they are kicking ass. I've got seedlings in there that are brand new. They
[04:40.380 --> 04:44.620]  are from another breeder. I don't know what to expect from those. They look beautiful.
[04:44.620 --> 04:49.760]  I've got clones in there, which I have grown several times. I know exactly what to expect
[04:49.760 --> 04:54.200]  from those. And they look beautiful under these lights. We're only in veg so far. Like
[04:54.200 --> 04:58.000]  I said, I just put them into three gallon pots. So they're new. The plants are new.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.480]  The lights are new so far in I am very excited and very impressed. The plants are eating
[05:03.480 --> 05:07.640]  a little bit more. I'm not getting as much heat. I feel like I'm probably not pulling
[05:07.640 --> 05:11.240]  as much electricity because it's not as hot in there. We'll find out at the end of the
[05:11.240 --> 05:15.060]  month when the light bill comes. But so far I'm excited. So big shout out to my buddy
[05:15.060 --> 05:20.620]  Keith and big shout out to Black Sale Market for the Canon LEDs. They are kicking ass.
[05:20.620 --> 05:25.720]  Most importantly, the plants look happy. That's really what matters. I'm satisfied and excited
[05:25.720 --> 05:30.220]  by the growth I'm getting from those plants because I did not set a timer. I'm going to
[05:30.220 --> 05:33.720]  set a timer real quick. If you're watching me play with my phone, I'm not being rude.
[05:33.720 --> 05:37.000]  I don't know how long I've been recording. I've got a good guess. But now we're going
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.340]  to set a real stopwatch so that we can kind of pay attention to that. Let's keep the show
[05:41.340 --> 05:45.260]  on the rails. You guys, I'm telling you this Blackberry banana cush has got me stoned to
[05:45.260 --> 05:48.600]  shit this new earbud hanging out of my ear is distracting. I think I'm going to do two
[05:48.600 --> 05:52.760]  earbuds in the next episode. It's going to feel better. There will be some experimentation
[05:52.760 --> 05:55.940]  happening trying to keep the show fresh and new. You guys, thank you for joining us for
[05:55.940 --> 06:00.600]  joining me this time. Where are we going to go from here? I've got a great message. This
[06:00.600 --> 06:05.000]  one came from my YouTube channel. I do answer some of the questions I find in the YouTube
[06:05.000 --> 06:09.740]  comments. However, it is more convenient for me if you send me your questions, comments
[06:09.740 --> 06:14.340]  and concerns via email. If you've got a cannabis culture or cannabis cultivation question,
[06:14.340 --> 06:19.720]  my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I would love to hear from you. Send me an
[06:19.720 --> 06:23.260]  email. That's the easiest way to get your question on the show. I can print that and
[06:23.260 --> 06:26.520]  then I can pull that paper and I can set it here in a pile. I've got a pile of emails
[06:26.520 --> 06:31.380]  which I read from that makes it much easier. The YouTube stuff, I've got to capture a screenshot.
[06:31.380 --> 06:35.160]  And then honestly, that gets lost in all my photos in my phone. I don't really find those
[06:35.160 --> 06:39.960]  as easily. I know I'm complaining about technology problems, but still send me an email, it would
[06:39.960 --> 06:44.600]  be much easier. You've got a better chance. However, I did like this question enough.
[06:44.600 --> 06:48.560]  I saw this one on YouTube and it caught my eye. So I thought we would address this here
[06:48.560 --> 06:52.200]  on the podcast. This is from YouTube. It's a comment left. Oh, also follow me on YouTube
[06:52.200 --> 06:55.960]  if you're not. Go to YouTube, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast, leave some comments
[06:55.960 --> 07:00.500]  on the videos, subscribe to the channel, join us, be part of the gang. This one comes from
[07:00.500 --> 07:04.940]  YouTube and it goes like this. Yo, Rasta Jeff, great show. What are the steps you take after
[07:04.940 --> 07:10.800]  processing your fresh seeds, dry time and or fridge time to make them a high germination
[07:10.800 --> 07:15.560]  ratio? Any info would be greatly appreciated. I've got a lot of good answers and a lot of
[07:15.560 --> 07:20.760]  good rambles for this. We've got to start with quality seeds. You're asking steps I
[07:20.760 --> 07:28.760]  take after processing to ensure high germination ratio. That high germination ratio was ensured
[07:28.760 --> 07:34.120]  much longer way before this situation, way before harvest ever started, way before we
[07:34.120 --> 07:38.400]  were processing seeds. I'm sure you understand that you've got to have proper pollination
[07:38.400 --> 07:42.080]  time. The females have to be at the right ovulation period. They have to be at their
[07:42.080 --> 07:45.880]  peak. You've got to pollinate them. You've got to use quality pollen. The male has to
[07:45.880 --> 07:50.000]  be dumping a lot of pollen. You've got to time the male and female. Every strain wants
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.840]  pollinated at a different time. You've got to pollinate them. Then you've got to feed
[07:53.840 --> 07:57.080]  them. Then you've got to keep them under quality lights. Don't let them get too shaded. Don't
[07:57.080 --> 08:00.360]  let them get malnourished. You've got to take good care of them. Then you have to have quality
[08:00.360 --> 08:04.440]  genetics. You have to know that the plants you were breeding with produce quality seeds,
[08:04.440 --> 08:10.880]  which also produce quality phenotypes. That is the first step to ... Not even the first.
[08:10.880 --> 08:13.400]  There are more steps before that. When we're making seeds, those are some of the first
[08:13.400 --> 08:18.080]  steps to quality control and making sure that we get good germination ratios. Then I'll
[08:18.080 --> 08:22.040]  just talk ... I'll talk mainly about how I harvest the seeds. Then we'll talk about the
[08:22.040 --> 08:25.760]  processing. Then we'll talk about the storage and all that. We'll just make it all one big
[08:25.760 --> 08:30.760]  talk because that way I'll make sure to cover everything for you. Here's how I do it. When
[08:30.760 --> 08:34.360]  I know the plants are going to be ready to harvest, I take off all of the big leaves.
[08:34.360 --> 08:38.760]  Keep in mind, I am talking about harvesting ... Ouch. I'm harvesting a seeded crop at
[08:38.760 --> 08:43.100]  this time. Everything we're harvesting in this lesson is loaded with seeds, so focus
[08:43.100 --> 08:48.400]  on the seeds. I'm not harvesting for buds. This is a different scenario. When I know
[08:48.400 --> 08:50.840]  it's almost harvest time, I go and take off all the leaves. Let me get my brain back on
[08:50.840 --> 08:54.560]  track and pull off all the leaves. I defoliate all that big leaf. Just pull it off, throw
[08:54.560 --> 08:58.720]  it on the floor. We'll sweep up later. Get all the leaves out of there. Then chop the
[08:58.720 --> 09:02.160]  plants. Label each plant because I've got multiple strains in the room. There might
[09:02.160 --> 09:05.640]  be four or five different strains in there because I may have crossed one male to four
[09:05.640 --> 09:10.400]  or five different females. That way we can have a nice variety. Usually three or four
[09:10.400 --> 09:14.200]  familiar things and one brand new things. If you're going to make a cross, why not experiment
[09:14.200 --> 09:17.120]  a little bit? Then you got seeds to sell and then you got freebies to give out. People
[09:17.120 --> 09:22.040]  can play with and see if they're worth a shit. I'll pollinate, defoliate, then we cut them
[09:22.040 --> 09:25.040]  down. We've cut down the plants. They're well labeled. They're hanging. They're going to
[09:25.040 --> 09:29.680]  dry. I let them get crispy dry. Sometimes I don't even hang them, depending on the amount
[09:29.680 --> 09:34.160]  of space I've got, depending on what's available. I like to put them in a big ... It's a Rubbermaid.
[09:34.160 --> 09:37.800]  It's a storage container that's meant to slide under the bed. I don't put the lid on it.
[09:37.800 --> 09:42.000]  I cut the plant down, lay it right in there. Then I stack them crisscrossed where they're
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.480]  a long way this way and then I turn it a long way this way. They stacked where they don't ... The
[09:45.480 --> 09:49.600]  buds don't crush each other. They're stacked container to container, but nothing's touching
[09:49.600 --> 09:53.200]  the buds. The edges of the containers hold them up. I'm sure you understand. The boxes
[09:53.200 --> 09:58.040]  crisscross. I've got plants in there. They're well labeled. I let those sit for several
[09:58.040 --> 10:02.880]  days. I don't need them to dry or cure in any special conditions. They sit in a spare
[10:02.880 --> 10:06.520]  room. They sit in a bedroom. They sit wherever there's space. My life is chaotic. I play
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.520]  drums. I have a lot of gear, so there's shit everywhere. They sit until they're dry. I've
[10:11.520 --> 10:15.200]  got some that have been sitting for probably 10 days now. I'm waiting for them to get dusty
[10:15.200 --> 10:19.160]  dry. I'm going to clean my garage. Yes, that's really going to happen. It's quarantine time.
[10:19.160 --> 10:22.080]  It's just come time to clean the garage. Once it's clean, I will go out there and I will
[10:22.080 --> 10:27.400]  sort those seeds. The way I will do it, I will grab the sticks and I will pull the sticks
[10:27.400 --> 10:30.400]  out of the buds. I'll just grab the sticks and put my hand around the stalk and just
[10:30.400 --> 10:34.960]  pull to where all the bud material. Excuse me, that was gross. I apologize. All the bud
[10:34.960 --> 10:39.600]  material will land in that Rubbermaid or that Tupperware dish, whatever brand it is. It
[10:39.600 --> 10:43.360]  lands in that container, which it was stored in for a little while, just chilling there.
[10:43.360 --> 10:47.440]  Now I've got just a bunch of dry, crumbly buds in there. All the sticks have been removed.
[10:47.440 --> 10:50.880]  Then I will put on gloves. I'm probably already wearing gloves at this point. I'll crumble
[10:50.880 --> 10:55.520]  it up real small. Just roll my hands through it and just rub it until it just crumbles
[10:55.520 --> 10:58.840]  up. I want to make basically, I don't put a lot of pressure. Keep in mind, I'm not trying
[10:58.840 --> 11:03.000]  to crush seeds. The buds are so dry that it's just going to crumble. I put it in the
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.680]  container, roll it around with my hands, crumble it real fine. I try to get out most of the
[11:06.680 --> 11:10.760]  small sticks by doing this. You find all the little stems, the bud stems. I don't want
[11:10.760 --> 11:15.400]  sticks left in there. I take all of that out. I want bud material and seeds. Once I'm pretty
[11:15.400 --> 11:20.200]  confident, I've got bud material and seeds, I pour that into a gallon baggie. Then I roll
[11:20.200 --> 11:23.680]  that around a little bit more to crush it up a little finer. I know, it sounds like
[11:23.680 --> 11:27.400]  I'm just destroying all the weed. Yes, I am. All I want out of here is the seeds. The weed
[11:27.440 --> 11:31.680]  gets put into the Bokashi bucket. It gets recycled. It goes into the compost bin. We
[11:31.680 --> 11:35.720]  don't consume that cannabis. It's not worth it. The seeds do just fine. We don't have
[11:35.720 --> 11:40.200]  to worry about losing that product. There's no loss. I grew it all for seed anyway. Now,
[11:40.200 --> 11:43.640]  I've got dust in a baggie. Right at the bottom of the baggie is a bunch of seed. At the top
[11:43.640 --> 11:47.320]  is a bunch of, we call it chaff. The stuff you're going to toss out in the hemp industry,
[11:47.320 --> 11:52.600]  that's been labeled chaff. We get rid of that. I've got a machine called an EZ Grow. It's
[11:52.600 --> 11:57.560]  an EZ Seed. Is that what it's called? I want to give them a proper shout out. EZ Seed Seed
[11:57.560 --> 12:01.880]  Sorter. It's a great device. It was a little costly, but it was well worth it for the amount
[12:01.880 --> 12:07.560]  of time and energy that it saved me. I basically pour that bag of crushed up flower material
[12:07.560 --> 12:12.200]  along with the seeds right into one side of this machine. It's got a fan in there. It's
[12:12.200 --> 12:19.440]  got two angled different aluminum doors basically. That fan blows the heavy shit one way. It
[12:19.440 --> 12:23.200]  falls one way and the light shit blows another way. You get two trays. When you pull out the
[12:23.200 --> 12:27.600]  drawers at the bottom, there's seeds in one and there's chaff in the other. I run it a couple
[12:27.600 --> 12:30.720]  of times. I separate it and I run it a couple of times because I'm a cheap ass. I don't want to
[12:30.720 --> 12:35.600]  lose any seeds. I also want to clean all the small shit out of there. If you get that machine,
[12:35.600 --> 12:38.960]  you'll learn a nice rhythm and how to do it. It'll work well the first time you do it. If you
[12:38.960 --> 12:43.040]  kind of pre-clean your seeds, I just run it a couple of times and I've got a nice rhythm. It
[12:43.040 --> 12:48.400]  works really well. Make it work for you, but it's a great machine. The EZ Seed Seed Sorter. I run my
[12:48.400 --> 12:52.880]  seeds through there. Then I clean them out. At this point now we've got material and we've got
[12:52.880 --> 12:58.800]  seeds. I usually have either small mason jars or big baggies of seeds depending on how many seeds
[12:58.800 --> 13:03.120]  there are, depending on what strain it is. Also, some seeds don't stick around long. Some seeds I
[13:03.120 --> 13:07.520]  can store and keep around and kind of hoard a little bit. Now we've got seeds in containers.
[13:08.640 --> 13:15.360]  I let them sit out until they're dry. I leave them in the jars with the lids open until I know
[13:15.360 --> 13:20.640]  that those seeds are dry. I also know that they have sat out for 10 to 12, maybe 14 or 15 days
[13:20.640 --> 13:24.880]  before I even got around to getting them out of the buds. I'm sure that these seeds are dry. I
[13:24.880 --> 13:30.160]  need them to dry. Moisture is your enemy when it comes to seed storage. I make sure they're dry. I
[13:30.160 --> 13:34.000]  can tell when I'm playing with the material. I can tell when I'm sorting them how dry it is.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.680]  If they're too soft, if they're too moist, they'll be too sticky. I'll be able to tell.
[13:37.680 --> 13:41.920]  I need them dry. Then I will put the lid on them or I will seal the baggie. If there's only a few
[13:41.920 --> 13:46.160]  hundred, I'll put them in a baggie. I like a small, you guys, the little two by three baggies.
[13:46.160 --> 13:51.200]  My stash goes in those. Then I put that stash in another airtight container. My seeds that are for
[13:51.200 --> 13:56.080]  me personally go store, get stored in a safe in the bottom of the, you don't even know exactly
[13:56.080 --> 14:00.720]  where it is, it's in a cool, dark, dry space. But that's a really nice environment for, it's like a
[14:00.720 --> 14:05.120]  low refrigerated area basically. It's a naturally cool environment and it's in a safe. Nothing gets
[14:05.120 --> 14:10.080]  to there. It's dark, not a lot of air movement. So my seeds are in a cool, dry, dark environment.
[14:10.080 --> 14:15.520]  You want to know what I do after I process them to keep a high germination rate. I make sure
[14:15.520 --> 14:19.360]  they're dry. You're asking about dry time. That's going to depend on environment. It's going to
[14:19.360 --> 14:24.160]  depend on where you are, but make sure they're dry. Probably 10 to 14 days is enough. Get them
[14:24.160 --> 14:27.840]  out of the buds, let them sit in a tray for a few more days. Make sure that's dry. Separate all the
[14:27.840 --> 14:33.840]  material. Feel them. Make sure that that's dry. Then you said fridge time. I've got a room in my
[14:33.840 --> 14:38.960]  house. Honestly, a basement is the ideal space. A basement naturally stays cool. I live in Colorado.
[14:38.960 --> 14:43.920]  My basement is naturally cool. If it's hot as shit upstairs, if it's cold as shit downstairs,
[14:43.920 --> 14:50.480]  it is naturally perfect. About 72, 74, maybe 68, 69 degrees in the basement. I think it's real
[14:50.480 --> 14:54.720]  cold. It'll get kind of chilly down there, but the seeds dig the cold. So they stay in a safe
[14:54.720 --> 14:58.480]  in the basement. It's fucking nice down there. That's where I store them. They either go in
[14:58.480 --> 15:02.560]  mason jars or in baggies, depending on how many seeds there are, depending on how quickly they
[15:02.560 --> 15:09.280]  sell. Then I package them up. I try to get, I make about 100 packs of whichever strain I'm going to
[15:09.280 --> 15:14.000]  work with. It just seems efficient. Depending on, it's about 100. I do about 60 and 30. So it's about
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.200]  90. The sheets of labels I work with come in 60. So you get 60 and 90. Just depends on how I'm
[15:19.200 --> 15:23.120]  feeling, how frisky I am, and how many I need, how many the vendors are taking. So then I package
[15:23.120 --> 15:27.280]  them up. It's probably too many details you don't need to know. I package them up. Those seeds get
[15:27.280 --> 15:33.040]  stored in a really chill area. It's dark. It's cool. It's dry. There's no moisture. There's no
[15:33.040 --> 15:36.880]  people in there. There's no lights coming on and it's cool. Most importantly, those seeds stay
[15:36.880 --> 15:40.880]  fairly cool. They don't want to get hot. That's what will slow them down. Light and moisture will
[15:40.880 --> 15:46.000]  also slow them down. So they just stay in a cool area in the basement. It's not refrigerated, but
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.800]  it doesn't need to be. It's just ambiently cool and they're packaged up. That way I don't, if I
[15:50.800 --> 15:54.240]  do get an order and somebody needs them, I don't have to scramble and try to get them together.
[15:54.240 --> 15:58.240]  Seeds Here Now is called Seeds Here Now because they'll get you seeds here now. I try to be part
[15:58.240 --> 16:04.080]  of that Seeds Here Now chain. Try to be quick. Try to be on top of it. So it's not a real technical
[16:04.080 --> 16:08.880]  process. Make sure they're dry before you store them. And that is the most important part. Then
[16:09.440 --> 16:14.080]  keep them dry and cool. You can put them, if your own personal stash of seeds can be stored
[16:14.080 --> 16:19.120]  in something dark and dry, make sure it's dry and sealed. You want it sealed. Maybe double seal it.
[16:19.120 --> 16:23.120]  Maybe seal it and put it in something else. Then you can store them in the crisper drawer of your
[16:23.120 --> 16:28.160]  refrigerator. I don't prefer to freeze them. Freezing will give you the opportunity for, the
[16:28.160 --> 16:32.320]  seeds may rupture. Also you get the opportunity for condensation. Every time you take them out of
[16:32.320 --> 16:36.960]  the freezer, the temperature inside that seed changes. The temperature in the container changes.
[16:36.960 --> 16:41.520]  Condensation may happen. We don't need to do that. So if you are taking your seeds in and out to show
[16:41.520 --> 16:46.320]  them off, keep them just in the fridge. And I get it. You want to show off some of your seeds. A lot
[16:46.400 --> 16:53.600]  of people are seed collectors. I encourage that. Seedsherenow.com. So I think that is the gist of
[16:53.600 --> 16:57.600]  what we have to say. What steps you take after processing. I told you basically my processing
[16:57.600 --> 17:03.680]  process. Dry time, it's probably 10 to 14 days. Fridge time, they're just stored in a cool, dry
[17:03.680 --> 17:09.440]  environment. And honestly, the key to successful germination and successful healthy seeds is good
[17:09.440 --> 17:13.360]  quality breeding. Make sure you breed properly. Make sure you feed those plants. Make sure they
[17:13.360 --> 17:18.400]  get the right light. I'm sure you guys have heard me talk about putting my plants back on an 18-6
[17:18.400 --> 17:22.880]  light cycle after pollination. That ensures really big, fat seeds. They're getting more light. They're
[17:22.880 --> 17:28.720]  getting more energy. People are going to say 18-6 in flower. Yes, 18-6 in flower after they're
[17:28.720 --> 17:32.800]  pollinated. I don't care what the buds look like. I want healthy seeds. My buds look like shit when
[17:32.800 --> 17:37.200]  they're done. I kill those buds and throw them away. We pull the seeds out. You guys, I am super
[17:37.200 --> 17:41.760]  rambly. I hope I answered your question. I feel like I answered that question super thoroughly.
[17:41.760 --> 17:46.480]  Big shout out to my friend TerpMonster on YouTube. I would appreciate it if everybody else
[17:46.480 --> 17:50.320]  out there gives us a follow on the YouTube channel. I am making these YouTube videos.
[17:50.320 --> 17:54.000]  Let me know what you think. It's kind of fun. I'm getting more comfortable. I'm going to buy more
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.480]  gear and do it more often. Shout out to TerpMonster. All right. This message comes from our friend who
[17:58.480 --> 18:02.240]  calls himself Papa Wheelie. We've heard from Papa Wheelie before. Thank you for joining us again on
[18:02.240 --> 18:06.960]  the show. Part of this is private. I'm going to skip over that. Let me roll through there. Scan,
[18:06.960 --> 18:11.520]  scan, scan. Then it goes like this. I've grown some prana and lemon sunrise in the past,
[18:11.520 --> 18:16.160]  and I love them both. I love hearing that. Those are great strains to grow. A good variety there.
[18:16.160 --> 18:22.640]  Prana's got that funky, almost a head shop, sort of an incense-y kind of a smell. Then lemon sunrise,
[18:22.640 --> 18:27.200]  of course, is just straight lemon turps and lemon pledge. Good variety. It says, I've grown those
[18:27.200 --> 18:31.440]  in the past, and I love them both. I'm glad they were successful for you. Congratulations.
[18:31.440 --> 18:36.320]  It goes on to say, if something middle of the road is an option that helps with anxiety,
[18:36.320 --> 18:41.760]  or at least isn't going to make me dig around in my head too much, what would be the most
[18:41.760 --> 18:47.920]  beneficial for me to grow right now? That is a really good question. I've spoken about anxiety
[18:47.920 --> 18:52.960]  and strains for anxiety previously, and I'm sure again in the future on the podcast. If you want
[18:52.960 --> 18:59.280]  to grow something from my line that is a little less on the anxiety side, I would probably recommend
[18:59.280 --> 19:05.920]  Orange Gasm, Michelangelo, or Sun Kiss. Those are all from the Platinum Tangy Cross. Big shout out
[19:05.920 --> 19:10.000]  to our friends Maddie and Spence at Garden of Weden for amazing breeding on that Platinum Tangy
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.760]  project. I love my Platinum Tangy cut. It smells amazing. It grows beautifully. I breed that to
[19:15.760 --> 19:20.640]  several other things. I've made the Michelangelo from there, that is Platinum Tangy to the Blueberry
[19:20.640 --> 19:25.760]  Cookies. I've made the Orange Gasm, that is Platinum Tangy to the Golden Goat. I've made
[19:25.760 --> 19:31.520]  Sun Kiss, which is Platinum Tangy to my Arise. I would recommend any of those three out of my line
[19:31.520 --> 19:35.920]  to keep you well medicated and not get you too deep into your head. Something about that
[19:35.920 --> 19:43.040]  orange terp really makes me, makes most people smiley and happy and less anxious than many other
[19:43.040 --> 19:48.560]  of the cannabinoids and terps out there. I think the orange flavored stuff is going to work very
[19:48.560 --> 19:54.080]  well for you. If you want something that is not from my line, I would recommend Jilly Bean. It's
[19:54.080 --> 19:58.880]  also got that really orange flavored terp. Jilly Bean seeds should be available. You may even be
[19:58.880 --> 20:03.920]  able to find them at seedsherenow.com. They are made by Miss Jill Genetics and those are definitely
[20:03.920 --> 20:09.920]  available. You will be able to find Jilly Bean crosses, if not straight Jilly Bean, at seedsherenow.com
[20:09.920 --> 20:14.880]  under the Miss Jill Genetics tab. I would also recommend something like Agent Orange. I don't
[20:14.880 --> 20:19.280]  know if you'll be able to find Agent Orange, but that Agent Orange or maybe an Orange Velvet,
[20:19.280 --> 20:23.520]  something with the orange in the terps, maybe an Orange Creamsicle, something like that is going
[20:23.520 --> 20:28.240]  to work well for you. I try to stick with my line, but I also know that sometimes you can't have
[20:28.240 --> 20:34.480]  access to my stuff. So look for that Jilly Bean or maybe Orange Gasm would be the first two I would
[20:34.480 --> 20:39.280]  recommend. Now there's more to this message. I want to keep on going. It says, you really are the best
[20:39.280 --> 20:45.120]  podcast out there. You are upbeat, polite, relevant, and the quality of your sound equipment makes
[20:45.120 --> 20:49.600]  other shows unlistenable to me. Well, thank you. I do appreciate that. I hope I didn't ruin it for
[20:49.600 --> 20:53.520]  all of the other podcasts out there. I do have a couple of friends that do a great show that's got
[20:53.520 --> 20:58.640]  great audio quality. So I hope you give them a chance. Also, upbeat. I try to be upbeat, dude. I'm
[20:58.640 --> 21:03.120]  in a good mood. We're talking about cannabis here. I shouldn't be angry. This fucking weed plant. No
[21:03.120 --> 21:08.480]  way, dude. I love cannabis. I'm upbeat. Polite. I'm usually polite. I did just say the F word, but
[21:08.480 --> 21:14.000]  I try to stay polite. I've got respect. I'm just that kind of guy. Relevant. Well, cannabis.
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.600]  That's why I don't write a book. This kind of started off, somebody said that I should write a
[21:17.600 --> 21:21.840]  book. And I was like, that book would be outdated by the time I got done publishing it. And then I
[21:21.840 --> 21:26.720]  was like, podcast. So relevant. Thank you. I try to stay relevant. That's why we do the podcast. So
[21:26.720 --> 21:33.360]  we did the information can be updated weekly. If I say something today, and I learn information,
[21:33.360 --> 21:37.280]  when I sign out of here, I can go, oh, shit. And then I can press record again. And I can say, hey,
[21:37.280 --> 21:41.840]  guys, I learned new techniques. Yesterday, I said, don't ever do this. Today, I have discovered
[21:41.840 --> 21:45.760]  reasons why we should do that. And I've held myself accountable on the show before updated
[21:45.760 --> 21:50.640]  my opinions and info. So staying relevant is very important. Thank you. I'm glad that you find me
[21:50.640 --> 21:54.960]  to be relevant. I'm gonna be an older guy. So it's good to know that I'm fucking relevant. That
[21:54.960 --> 22:00.880]  means a lot to me. Thank you, bro. The sound quality of my equipment. That that's, that means
[22:00.880 --> 22:05.440]  a lot to me. I'm kind of an audio nerd. I started off I've been a traveling musician, a touring
[22:05.440 --> 22:11.200]  musician, a recording musician, I've got a lot of toys. And to not sound good drives me crazy. I
[22:11.200 --> 22:17.040]  won't listen to some podcasts. If you've got a guest call in on a phone on your podcast, there's
[22:17.040 --> 22:20.880]  a good chance I'm skipping that episode, which I know is hypocritical, because I do get Mike up
[22:20.880 --> 22:25.120]  here on zoom. I feel like the zoom shows are better. I bought him equipment. I'm not bragging
[22:25.120 --> 22:27.840]  that I bought him shit. But I'm saying I bought him equipment to make him sound good. He's not
[22:27.840 --> 22:32.640]  using the damn phone. So thank you, man. I'm glad that you notice that the equipment sounds good.
[22:32.640 --> 22:36.960]  Today I'm experimenting with this new earbud. I like it. I need two earbuds for next time. But we
[22:36.960 --> 22:41.440]  can fix that. Not a big deal. Then we'll work on the lapel mics. You guys can see my stylish
[22:41.440 --> 22:45.600]  iRegenetics t shirt. You can't even see that. So we're going to do a few upgrades. And I promise
[22:45.600 --> 22:50.000]  I'll keep the sound coming. Well, if the sound starts slipping with the new gear, please Papa
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.760]  Willie, I look forward to you letting me know that I'm slipping. Just send me a message and say,
[22:53.760 --> 22:58.320]  hey, bro, the sound kind of bites right now. And I'll get it back up to up to speed. He wraps this
[22:58.320 --> 23:03.680]  one up. He says, Thank you so much. I'll thank you in person. If you come out to New England again,
[23:03.680 --> 23:09.280]  sometime soon. I've got a lot of friends inviting me out to the New England area, maybe time for a
[23:09.280 --> 23:14.640]  Rasta Jeff Boston Freedom Rally trip or something like that. Go see all my asshole friends out there
[23:14.640 --> 23:19.440]  on the coast. Go hang out, go spend some time go eat some good food. Might be almost time for that.
[23:19.440 --> 23:22.720]  Hey, Papa Willie, I want to thank you for the great message. Thank you for always supporting
[23:22.720 --> 23:28.480]  the show. If you've got any more questions, please send me more emails. I do look forward to it. And
