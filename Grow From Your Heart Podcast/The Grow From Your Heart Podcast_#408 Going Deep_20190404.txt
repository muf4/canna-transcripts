[00:00.000 --> 00:02.440]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.440 --> 00:06.080]  It's time for episode 408 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.080 --> 00:09.360]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:09.360 --> 00:13.640]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and you can
[00:13.640 --> 00:19.880]  find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:19.880 --> 00:24.240]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I am dabbing.
[00:24.240 --> 00:29.640]  Today I've been taking dabs of Screaming Tangerines Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:29.680 --> 00:36.280]  This is labeled as 70.4% THC and 82.1% total cannabinoids.
[00:36.280 --> 00:37.280]  This is a little saucy.
[00:37.280 --> 00:43.040]  I would prefer a little more crystals in here, but the turpy flavor, that ridiculous Screaming
[00:43.040 --> 00:47.120]  Tangerine flavor makes it worth that saucy consistency.
[00:47.120 --> 00:50.480]  So I'm loving the flavor of this, and it's got a great head buzz to it, and I'm going
[00:50.480 --> 00:51.480]  to go back for more.
[00:51.480 --> 00:54.200]  So big shout out to our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:54.200 --> 00:56.600]  All right, Podcast World.
[00:56.600 --> 01:01.600]  I want to give everybody a huge thank you for the reaction to my appearance on the Dude
[01:01.600 --> 01:02.600]  Grows podcast.
[01:02.600 --> 01:06.520]  I've gotten a lot of great emails, a lot of great Instagram messages.
[01:06.520 --> 01:10.000]  I've gotten a lot of great responses to that show.
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.920]  I want to thank everybody for all of the support, and again, I want to thank all of my friends
[01:13.920 --> 01:17.600]  at the Dude Grows show, and of course, all of the Dude Grows crew.
[01:17.600 --> 01:24.360]  I can't wait to see everybody at the Dude Grows Cup on April 13th at Cultivated Synergy.
[01:24.360 --> 01:27.840]  I got a lot of great messages, but my favorite messages were about my dreads.
[01:27.840 --> 01:29.520]  Dude, are those dreadlocks real?
[01:29.520 --> 01:31.240]  How old are those dreads?
[01:31.240 --> 01:32.440]  Killer dreads.
[01:32.440 --> 01:33.640]  Lots of compliments on the dreads.
[01:33.640 --> 01:35.080]  Yes, the dreadlocks are real.
[01:35.080 --> 01:37.320]  These dreadlocks are 14 years old.
[01:37.320 --> 01:40.960]  If I would untie them from the bun in which they were in when I was on the show, they
[01:40.960 --> 01:43.040]  go down to my knees.
[01:43.040 --> 01:46.280]  That's a little bit ridiculous because I am 6'5".
[01:46.280 --> 01:48.280]  So yes, the dreadlocks are real.
[01:48.280 --> 01:52.080]  They are 14 years old, and they go down to my knees.
[01:52.080 --> 01:54.920]  So if you've never seen a photo of me or if you've wondered what I've looked like,
[01:54.920 --> 01:58.960]  I encourage you to go check out the episode of the Dude Grows show that features Rasta
[01:58.960 --> 02:00.760]  Jeff from iReGenetics.
[02:00.760 --> 02:01.880]  Go look at a video.
[02:01.880 --> 02:04.760]  Go see why they call me Rasta Jeff.
[02:04.760 --> 02:08.040]  Now in this episode, I do plan on reading a few listener emails.
[02:08.040 --> 02:13.120]  I do enjoy doing the listener-generated content, but before we get there, I owe a few people
[02:13.120 --> 02:15.000]  some shout-outs from Patreon.
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.160]  How about a big shout-out to Steve F., a shout-out to Keith Klump, a giant shout-out to Riley
[02:20.160 --> 02:24.600]  H., how about a big Grow From Your Heart shout-out to Matthew KW, and of course, a
[02:24.600 --> 02:27.840]  big shout-out to my friend Todd K.
[02:27.840 --> 02:34.920]  And if you would like to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to www.patreon.com
[02:34.920 --> 02:36.920]  slash growfromyourheart.
[02:36.920 --> 02:40.440]  All the information you need to become a patron will be right there on the screen.
[02:40.440 --> 02:44.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I said I was going to read some listener emails.
[02:44.280 --> 02:45.460]  Let's jump right into that.
[02:45.460 --> 02:49.080]  If you have got a grow question, if you need some grow guidance or some grow advice, or
[02:49.080 --> 02:52.040]  if you've got something you'd like to say, you can send me an email.
[02:52.040 --> 02:55.840]  My email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[02:55.840 --> 02:57.320]  I would love to hear from you.
[02:57.320 --> 03:00.620]  Maybe we can get your email on a future episode.
[03:00.620 --> 03:04.760]  The first email in today's episode goes a lot like this.
[03:04.760 --> 03:05.880]  What's up, Rasta Jeff?
[03:05.880 --> 03:08.360]  Great podcast on the moon questions.
[03:08.360 --> 03:10.040]  Red proteins, what?
[03:10.040 --> 03:11.040]  Makes total sense.
[03:11.040 --> 03:16.320]  Then he goes on to say, my Arise platoon got a little stretch, but they are starting to
[03:16.320 --> 03:19.600]  put some meat on their bones the last day or two.
[03:19.600 --> 03:23.040]  Then he goes on to say, also, Gollum has devoured her twin.
[03:23.040 --> 03:25.440]  Okay, now that is a funny conversation.
[03:25.440 --> 03:27.400]  We were talking about he grew some seeds.
[03:27.400 --> 03:32.680]  He grew some Arise seedlings, and one of them grew two seedlings, two sprouts out of the
[03:32.680 --> 03:34.560]  one seedling.
[03:34.560 --> 03:38.160]  We were talking a little bit about that, and I told him that he should name it after the
[03:38.160 --> 03:41.280]  nurse with the conjoined twin in South Park.
[03:41.280 --> 03:46.280]  That plant got named Nurse Gollum, and apparently, eventually, Nurse Gollum devoured her twin.
[03:46.760 --> 03:51.520]  It is now just one plant, which is kind of how Nurse Gollum turned out.
[03:51.520 --> 03:52.520]  The message continues.
[03:52.520 --> 03:57.400]  He says, question, when I transplant into one gallon fabric pots, can I plant them a
[03:57.400 --> 03:59.520]  little deep to help them out?
[03:59.520 --> 04:02.480]  What is the rule of thumb on this?
[04:02.480 --> 04:04.160]  Here's what it sounds like is happening.
[04:04.160 --> 04:07.680]  This guy sprouted some Arise seeds, and they are getting a little tall.
[04:07.680 --> 04:10.240]  They're probably getting stretchy because of a lack of light.
[04:10.240 --> 04:13.960]  The light is probably not intense enough, or it is probably too far away.
[04:13.960 --> 04:16.880]  Your little plants, your little seedlings are trying to stretch toward that light.
[04:16.880 --> 04:21.000]  That light is their main source of life, so they want to get as close to that as possible.
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.120]  They're expecting sunshine, and they're not getting it, so they're trying to climb up,
[04:24.120 --> 04:25.800]  trying to get to that light.
[04:25.800 --> 04:27.760]  They've gotten a little bit stretchy, a little bit leggy.
[04:27.760 --> 04:28.760]  They're kind of tall on you.
[04:28.760 --> 04:35.040]  Now, it is time to transplant these Arise seedlings into a one-gallon fabric pot.
[04:35.040 --> 04:38.360]  I'm assuming at this point, you've got them in something smaller, something like a beer
[04:38.360 --> 04:40.440]  cup or maybe something even a little smaller.
[04:40.440 --> 04:42.280]  Maybe you've got them in a Jiffy pot still.
[04:42.280 --> 04:47.120]  I'm not exactly sure what you're doing, but it is time to put these babies into a one-gallon
[04:47.120 --> 04:48.320]  fabric pot.
[04:48.320 --> 04:52.800]  You're asking if you can plant them a little bit deep to help them out, which I'm thinking
[04:52.800 --> 04:53.800]  you mean.
[04:53.800 --> 04:55.000]  You've got a one-gallon pot.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.320]  You're going to fill it up, and then where it should be full, you're going to knock out
[04:58.320 --> 05:03.140]  maybe one or two inches worth of soil, and then plant your plant there, and then overfill
[05:03.140 --> 05:07.160]  it with that one or two inches of soil so that you're going to bury part of the plant
[05:07.160 --> 05:11.920]  as to make it appear shorter so it's not popping out of the soil as much, but in reality, you
[05:11.920 --> 05:15.480]  still have that three-inch long seedling or however long it has grown.
[05:15.480 --> 05:19.640]  It looks like you've got an inch popping out of the soil because you've buried two inches.
[05:19.640 --> 05:23.360]  If you feel like those plants have gotten too tall for you and you really need to minimize
[05:23.360 --> 05:27.960]  their height to keep them from toppling over, this is something you can do.
[05:27.960 --> 05:29.760]  You can do this with a little tiny seedlings.
[05:29.760 --> 05:32.760]  You can do this when you're planting from your beer cup into a three-gallon.
[05:32.760 --> 05:36.440]  You can do this when you're going from a three-gallon into a seven-gallon or a three-gallon into
[05:36.440 --> 05:41.100]  a 50-gallon, but the thing you need to be very careful of is keep in mind that you are
[05:41.100 --> 05:43.360]  burying a portion of the stem.
[05:43.360 --> 05:47.940]  However much of that stem is going into the dirt that wasn't buried before, that part
[05:47.940 --> 05:53.180]  is not comfortable and not familiar with being buried with dirt and being submerged and possibly
[05:53.180 --> 05:56.660]  being soaked with water for long periods of time.
[05:56.660 --> 06:01.440]  The first few times you water, you need to be careful to not soak that part of the plant.
[06:01.440 --> 06:05.220]  You've got a fresh part of the plant that has been exposed for the entire time of its
[06:05.220 --> 06:08.700]  life up until this time that you're burying it, and now you're going to get it really,
[06:08.700 --> 06:09.700]  really wet.
[06:09.700 --> 06:14.020]  You're going to run the risk of some kind of soggy root rot or something similar happening
[06:14.020 --> 06:15.020]  to that stalk.
[06:15.020 --> 06:17.180]  I guess it would be stalk rot at that point.
[06:17.180 --> 06:19.980]  It's just going to get funky in there if you overwater.
[06:19.980 --> 06:23.780]  Your goal is to get the water down deep into the medium into those roots.
[06:23.780 --> 06:26.220]  You don't want to drown that fresh stalk part.
[06:26.220 --> 06:30.380]  You need to give that some time to adjust, to acclimate to its new surroundings.
[06:30.380 --> 06:32.800]  If you're going to do that, be very careful.
[06:32.800 --> 06:36.860]  With a smaller plant, you're just going to have to water maybe a little bit less, less
[06:36.860 --> 06:39.440]  water at a time and more frequently.
[06:39.440 --> 06:43.380]  With a larger plant, what you can do, and what you should be doing anyway with larger
[06:43.380 --> 06:48.540]  plants is water the outer perimeter of the pot as to not soak the inside of the pot so
[06:48.540 --> 06:50.140]  much where that main stalk is.
[06:50.140 --> 06:53.580]  It's going to be hard to control where the water goes, but if you've got a really large
[06:53.580 --> 06:58.220]  pot and you just water that outer part where the ... If you've got a three-gallon pot and
[06:58.220 --> 07:02.020]  you just put it into maybe a 10-gallon, you just want that edge of the three-gallon, that
[07:02.020 --> 07:06.540]  outer exposed root to be hit by that water, not the inside of the stick.
[07:07.220 --> 07:09.540]  I know that sounds ridiculous, but you see what I mean.
[07:09.540 --> 07:11.300]  You're trying to get right at that edge.
[07:11.300 --> 07:12.420]  There's a ring you're trying to hit.
[07:12.420 --> 07:15.620]  The out of the three and the start of that 10, that fresh dirt, you're just trying to
[07:15.620 --> 07:20.520]  wet that part for the first couple of waters to give that stick some time.
[07:20.520 --> 07:21.520]  Don't go too deep.
[07:21.520 --> 07:24.940]  Now, don't get ridiculous and go burying it really deep.
[07:24.940 --> 07:25.940]  Use some judgment.
[07:25.940 --> 07:27.460]  Think about the health of your plant.
[07:27.460 --> 07:29.260]  Think about the size of your stalk.
[07:29.260 --> 07:31.020]  Think about the root mass you've got.
[07:31.020 --> 07:33.640]  Just pay attention to what you're doing and think about the plants.
[07:33.640 --> 07:37.580]  Give the plant some breathing room and do not drown it and do not smother it by trying
[07:37.580 --> 07:38.580]  to do this.
[07:38.580 --> 07:41.960]  But, yes, it will work if you do it properly.
[07:41.960 --> 07:45.640]  Now, something I'm going to recommend is get a fan on those seedlings.
[07:45.640 --> 07:49.200]  If they're getting too leggy, if they're tipping over, they need more light and they need a
[07:49.200 --> 07:50.200]  fan.
[07:50.200 --> 07:53.480]  So, brighten up the light, get a fan on them, give them a chance.
[07:53.480 --> 07:56.440]  If you kind of give them a little struggle, give them some adversity, they'll come out
[07:56.440 --> 07:57.760]  stronger in the end.
[07:57.760 --> 08:00.140]  So, give them a little bit of a struggle with that fan.
[08:00.140 --> 08:02.720]  Make them kind of reach a little bit so that they stand up a little bit.
[08:02.800 --> 08:05.760]  Now, something I've never really said here on the podcast, I don't think, and I'm going
[08:05.760 --> 08:09.640]  to touch on this just because I was talking about watering the outer perimeter.
[08:09.640 --> 08:12.000]  Think about the way your cannabis plants are shaped.
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.160]  If we don't interact with them, they grow up and then they grow leaves that kind of
[08:16.160 --> 08:19.240]  point down, kind of in a cone-shaped fashion.
[08:19.240 --> 08:20.960]  The plant gets wider as it gets older.
[08:20.960 --> 08:23.120]  It gets taller and wider and taller and wider.
[08:23.120 --> 08:28.400]  But one thing it continues to do is create the same type of effect as a shingled roof.
[08:28.400 --> 08:31.640]  If you look at the way the water flows, go spray the top of your plants.
[08:31.640 --> 08:35.800]  The water will run from the top leaves down to the next set of leaves.
[08:35.800 --> 08:38.240]  As they do it, they come outward and they come outward.
[08:38.240 --> 08:42.080]  They come further and further from the center of the plant, the more they drip down the
[08:42.080 --> 08:43.080]  plant.
[08:43.080 --> 08:46.880]  That water will keep continuing downward and outward further away from the center of that
[08:46.880 --> 08:47.880]  plant.
[08:47.880 --> 08:52.040]  If you look at a plant after it rains, right underneath the plant is not wet, but that
[08:52.040 --> 08:57.180]  ring right around the plant, it's really soaked with water because all the water has run down
[08:57.180 --> 08:58.960]  and out and down and out.
[08:58.960 --> 09:03.040]  It's just making a wider and wider ring as it runs down and then right around the plant,
[09:03.040 --> 09:04.480]  it gets nicely watered.
[09:04.480 --> 09:06.720]  So think about that when you're watering your container plants.
[09:06.720 --> 09:11.460]  We want to water the outer part where the most active root tips are searching for water
[09:11.460 --> 09:13.040]  and food.
[09:13.040 --> 09:15.920]  So I hope there's some usable guidance in there for your situation.
[09:15.920 --> 09:17.080]  The email does continue.
[09:17.080 --> 09:22.160]  He says, I've got some papaya females I'm hoping to cross with one of these arise males
[09:22.160 --> 09:23.720]  for my first cross.
[09:23.720 --> 09:27.280]  What are you looking for in King Solomon?
[09:27.280 --> 09:31.780]  I am super picky and super meticulous when it comes to male selection, but I have done
[09:31.780 --> 09:35.440]  an entire podcast about breeding and male selection.
[09:35.440 --> 09:38.760]  Episode 174 will help you out tremendously.
[09:38.760 --> 09:43.200]  But the most important part after you do the male selection, after you do the breeding,
[09:43.200 --> 09:47.080]  the most important part of the whole project is to test your progeny.
[09:47.080 --> 09:50.120]  You have got to grow the offspring and see what you've got.
[09:50.120 --> 09:55.180]  That is the only way to know if that male is delivering traits that are desirable.
[09:55.180 --> 09:58.980]  So the most important part is to test that offspring.
[09:58.980 --> 09:59.980]  You know what?
[09:59.980 --> 10:02.340]  The most important part is to have fun with your breeding project.
[10:02.340 --> 10:07.620]  So do a good male selection, pollinate properly, let the seeds finish, harvest and dry them
[10:07.620 --> 10:09.180]  properly, grow them out.
[10:09.180 --> 10:12.580]  But most importantly, make sure you have fun with this breeding project.
[10:12.580 --> 10:14.540]  I don't know why I tried to make it so uptight.
[10:14.540 --> 10:16.420]  I forgot to grow from my heart for a minute there.
[10:16.420 --> 10:17.620]  I'm sorry, you guys.
[10:17.620 --> 10:20.220]  He wraps up this email and he says, what's up Nemo Punk 15.
[10:20.220 --> 10:23.140]  So we've got another listener sending a big shout out to White Mike.
[10:23.140 --> 10:26.780]  White Mike is on vacation, but as soon as he gets back, I'll give him a high five for
[10:26.780 --> 10:27.780]  you.
[10:27.780 --> 10:28.780]  Big shout out to White Mike.
[10:28.780 --> 10:31.940]  Also a big shout out to our friend at Left Field Farms for this great email.
[10:31.940 --> 10:33.700]  Hey dude, thank you for the great email.
[10:33.700 --> 10:38.340]  I hope I answered all of your questions and I look forward to hearing from you again in
[10:38.340 --> 10:39.340]  the future.
[10:39.340 --> 10:41.020]  All right, podcast world.
[10:41.020 --> 10:45.940]  I do have a medical marijuana renewal appointment set for just a few minutes from now.
[10:45.940 --> 10:47.300]  So I am going to press pause.
[10:47.300 --> 10:51.140]  I'm going to take several ridiculous dabs because I know I'm going to be in the waiting
[10:51.140 --> 10:52.620]  room for several minutes.
[10:52.620 --> 10:56.380]  Then I'm going to head to my medical marijuana renewal appointment.
[10:56.380 --> 10:59.520]  Then I will be back to resume this episode.
[10:59.520 --> 11:04.260]  You guys take a few dabs and I'll be right back.
[11:04.260 --> 11:05.300]  All right, podcast world.
[11:05.300 --> 11:10.140]  I am back and I am officially a registered Colorado medical marijuana patient for one
[11:10.140 --> 11:11.980]  more full year.
[11:11.980 --> 11:14.220]  My appointment was fairly quick and fairly easy.
[11:14.220 --> 11:18.420]  I spent more time in the waiting room, waiting to see the doc than I did anything else.
[11:18.420 --> 11:19.980]  I'm pretty familiar with that paperwork.
[11:19.980 --> 11:22.060]  I've done the paperwork several times.
[11:22.500 --> 11:25.580]  I've been to that doctor's office and seen that doctor several times.
[11:25.580 --> 11:29.580]  So I'm very familiar with the process and it went fairly quickly and fairly smoothly
[11:29.580 --> 11:30.580]  this time.
[11:30.580 --> 11:34.740]  So I am a registered Colorado medical marijuana patient for one more full year.
[11:34.740 --> 11:35.740]  It is done.
[11:35.740 --> 11:36.740]  It is complete.
[11:36.740 --> 11:39.020]  I don't have to go back for another full year.
[11:39.020 --> 11:40.780]  Let's continue on with this episode.
[11:40.780 --> 11:42.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was reading emails.
[11:42.580 --> 11:47.500]  I've got another great email here in front of me and this email goes a lot like this.
[11:47.500 --> 11:49.300]  Thank you for the grow series.
[11:49.300 --> 11:51.220]  It has been super informative.
[11:51.220 --> 11:57.260]  You did not mention if the temps in veg through harvest are the same when using CO2.
[11:57.260 --> 12:02.980]  Most people say to run temps at 85 degrees in veg with CO2, but I'm not sure if you agree.
[12:02.980 --> 12:06.140]  What about temps through flowering with CO2?
[12:06.140 --> 12:10.140]  And would you stop using CO2 at some point in flower?
[12:10.140 --> 12:12.180]  Thank you, signed Andrew M14.
[12:12.180 --> 12:17.420]  Hey, Andrew M14, thank you for a great email and thank you for pointing out that I missed
[12:17.420 --> 12:18.460]  a detail.
[12:18.460 --> 12:20.420]  So let's talk about this.
[12:20.420 --> 12:23.940]  I did a long series of grow lessons and we talked about growing all the way from the
[12:23.940 --> 12:25.420]  beginning to the end.
[12:25.420 --> 12:31.580]  I talked about temperatures and humidity levels and one thing I overlooked was augmented CO2.
[12:31.580 --> 12:36.420]  When we are increasing CO2 to high performance levels, we are able to run the plants at higher
[12:36.420 --> 12:37.420]  temperatures.
[12:37.420 --> 12:39.940]  So yes, I did overlook that one detail.
[12:39.940 --> 12:40.940]  I would agree.
[12:40.940 --> 12:45.580]  Where you say some people say to run temps at 85 degrees in veg with CO2, I would say
[12:45.580 --> 12:46.820]  that that is acceptable.
[12:46.820 --> 12:51.420]  80 to 85 degrees would be great for a room running CO2.
[12:51.420 --> 12:54.140]  I would also run these high temperatures through flower.
[12:54.140 --> 12:58.220]  However, I would slowly reduce the temperature through the flowering phase.
[12:58.220 --> 13:01.940]  We like to reduce the temperature, kind of mimic the outside fall conditions, bring out
[13:01.940 --> 13:02.940]  some of those colors.
[13:02.940 --> 13:05.420]  It'll also help bring out some of those sweet flavors.
[13:05.420 --> 13:09.380]  It also helps speed up the ripeness on some longer flowering cultivars.
[13:09.380 --> 13:13.940]  So bring out that cold a little bit later in flower, maybe week seven, eight, nine,
[13:13.940 --> 13:17.340]  reduce the temperature a little bit every week and bring it down.
[13:17.340 --> 13:22.900]  Now the second half of this question is, would you stop using CO2 at some point in flower?
[13:22.900 --> 13:27.620]  CO2 can become very expensive depending on the size of your room and the efficiency of
[13:27.620 --> 13:31.700]  your room, how sealed up your room is, how often you're exhausting the air.
[13:31.700 --> 13:34.220]  Maybe you're just blowing the CO2 right out with your HVAC.
[13:34.220 --> 13:37.640]  CO2 can become very costly.
[13:37.640 --> 13:41.740]  In an ideal world, I would not stop using CO2 ever.
[13:41.740 --> 13:46.220]  The plants would go into a room with CO2 from day one and all the way up to harvest,
[13:46.220 --> 13:49.500]  they would be in a high CO2 augmented environment.
[13:49.500 --> 13:53.260]  So no, I do not stop augmenting CO2 later in flower.
[13:53.260 --> 13:59.300]  I like running it all the way through, even when I do begin reducing those temperatures.
[13:59.300 --> 14:04.060]  I find that once you've started increasing CO2, it is really detrimental to the performance
[14:04.060 --> 14:07.500]  of the plants if you stop giving it that CO2.
[14:07.500 --> 14:09.060]  So think about it this way.
[14:09.060 --> 14:13.940]  In my opinion, CO2 is kind of the last thing you should add to your growth.
[14:13.940 --> 14:15.180]  That is the turbo charge.
[14:15.180 --> 14:16.380]  That's your nitrous.
[14:16.380 --> 14:19.260]  You've already got the nutrient regimen dialed in.
[14:19.260 --> 14:21.020]  You've got the light dialed in.
[14:21.020 --> 14:23.020]  You know how to take good care of the plants.
[14:23.020 --> 14:24.020]  You are a professional.
[14:24.020 --> 14:25.660]  Then you add the CO2.
[14:25.660 --> 14:27.660]  That's like the last bonus step of the way.
[14:27.660 --> 14:31.180]  That CO2 is what is going to push you over the limit, but learn how to grow before you
[14:31.180 --> 14:32.180]  add that.
[14:32.180 --> 14:33.180]  So now you've got the CO2.
[14:33.180 --> 14:36.340]  Now you are turbo charging your plants.
[14:36.340 --> 14:39.460]  You've got everything dialed in and you're pushing that turbo button.
[14:39.460 --> 14:42.380]  Now you've been pushing that turbo button for six weeks.
[14:42.380 --> 14:45.980]  Now you're feeding those plants a high, high performance diet.
[14:45.980 --> 14:50.020]  I feel like if we've got all of the nutrients dialed in, if we've got the lights dialed
[14:50.020 --> 14:55.140]  in, the CO2 is dialed in, we are certainly in a high performance environment.
[14:55.140 --> 14:58.980]  Now think about if you take that CO2 away and you try to feed those plants the same
[14:58.980 --> 15:03.220]  feed regimen, they are not going to have one of their things that works them out to make
[15:03.220 --> 15:06.300]  that high performance diet all click together.
[15:06.300 --> 15:07.300]  You're going to burn them.
[15:07.300 --> 15:11.900]  They're not going to be able to metabolize as much food if we are not giving them the
[15:11.900 --> 15:15.580]  CO2 that they were familiar with getting in the past.
[15:15.580 --> 15:19.480]  Imagine if I put you on a solid workout routine and I started feeding you like a savage, we
[15:19.480 --> 15:23.500]  gave you the best athletic diet that science could dial in for you.
[15:23.500 --> 15:27.340]  Then once you got that diet solid, you're good at your workout, you've got a good foundation.
[15:27.340 --> 15:28.740]  Now we're going to give you some steroids.
[15:28.740 --> 15:29.980]  Now you're lifting more than ever.
[15:29.980 --> 15:31.660]  You're running faster than ever.
[15:31.660 --> 15:34.580]  You're the $420 million man at this point.
[15:34.660 --> 15:38.460]  Now one day I'm just going to stop giving you all of your protein, but I'm going to
[15:38.460 --> 15:42.740]  keep giving you the steroids and everything else, and I'm going to expect the same performance
[15:42.740 --> 15:43.980]  from you.
[15:43.980 --> 15:45.460]  Something is going to go wrong.
[15:45.460 --> 15:48.980]  You're not getting all of the parts of the cogs that make those wheels turn.
[15:48.980 --> 15:51.300]  So somewhere something is going to blow out.
[15:51.300 --> 15:55.880]  And when you stop inducing CO2 in the plants after they're really used to it, they really
[15:55.880 --> 15:57.500]  let you know that they miss it.
[15:57.500 --> 15:59.140]  They're like, hey, we want that shit back.
[15:59.140 --> 16:02.060]  I am not going to run laps as fast as I used to.
[16:02.060 --> 16:03.540]  I'm going to start getting slow.
[16:03.540 --> 16:05.180]  I'm going to start getting droopy.
[16:05.180 --> 16:09.700]  And all of that money that you spent on CO2 for those six weeks in flour and however many
[16:09.700 --> 16:13.660]  weeks in veg, now they're kind of not even worth it because you're just negating that
[16:13.660 --> 16:19.460]  by not inducing or augmenting or increasing the CO2 levels to a high performance environment
[16:19.460 --> 16:21.260]  later in flour.
[16:21.260 --> 16:22.700]  So that is my long answer.
[16:22.700 --> 16:26.620]  No, I would not stop using CO2 at some point in flour.
[16:26.620 --> 16:29.260]  I would use CO2 all the way through flour.
[16:29.260 --> 16:30.260]  Try to plan ahead.
[16:30.260 --> 16:31.620]  Plan it in your budget.
[16:31.620 --> 16:36.260]  If you can predict that you are going to be low on funding toward the end of flowering,
[16:36.260 --> 16:39.860]  try to budget your CO2 money late in flour.
[16:39.860 --> 16:44.500]  Don't use as much CO2 for the first couple of weeks so that you can save that funding
[16:44.500 --> 16:48.900]  for the last few weeks of flour when that CO2 is really going to push those big beefy
[16:48.900 --> 16:51.020]  flowers to that extra limit.
[16:51.020 --> 16:57.060]  So think about your budget and try to plan ahead and try to spend your CO2 budget wisely.
[16:57.060 --> 17:00.900]  Hey, Andrew M14, I want to thank you for a great email.
[17:01.180 --> 17:04.540]  Again, if anybody out there would like to send me a grow question or any type of grow
[17:04.540 --> 17:10.500]  or a cannabis related email, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[17:10.500 --> 17:12.820]  You know, I would love to hear from you.
[17:12.820 --> 17:15.340]  The next email in my pile goes like this.
[17:15.340 --> 17:20.420]  Hey Jeff, first off, thank you for the hard work you put into the podcast and for sharing
[17:20.420 --> 17:21.420]  your knowledge.
[17:21.420 --> 17:25.340]  I truly appreciate it and I have learned an absolute ton.
[17:25.340 --> 17:26.340]  You are very welcome.
[17:26.340 --> 17:27.980]  Thank you for the great email.
[17:27.980 --> 17:28.980]  The email continues.
[17:28.980 --> 17:33.380]  He says, secondly, I have a couple of questions that I hope you can find the time to help
[17:33.380 --> 17:34.380]  me with.
[17:34.380 --> 17:35.700]  So here it goes.
[17:35.700 --> 17:41.060]  It seems that Lemon Jeffrey is sold out online at the several seed banks you supply.
[17:41.060 --> 17:46.100]  Do you have any sort of timeline when you expect to have those genetics available again?
[17:46.100 --> 17:47.700]  Yes, I do.
[17:47.700 --> 17:51.380]  That is a great question because I can tell you that from the time of this recording,
[17:51.380 --> 17:55.060]  those Lemon Jeffrey seeds will be available in approximately 80 days.
[17:55.060 --> 17:57.860]  I am recording this in the first week of April.
[17:57.860 --> 18:02.820]  So you've got about 80 days and we will have more Lemon Jeffrey seeds available and those
[18:02.820 --> 18:06.300]  will be available at OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[18:06.300 --> 18:07.720]  They will get the first batch.
[18:07.720 --> 18:11.340]  So make sure you check there in about 80 days from now.
[18:11.340 --> 18:17.060]  It's going to be April, May, probably the middle of June, possibly the start of July.
[18:17.060 --> 18:23.340]  We will have Lemon Jeffrey seeds and several more feminized Golden Goat crosses available
[18:23.340 --> 18:26.140]  through OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[18:26.140 --> 18:29.780]  And again, that is at OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[18:29.780 --> 18:31.340]  Make sure you check that out.
[18:31.340 --> 18:32.620]  So the email continues.
[18:32.620 --> 18:37.800]  The next part says, also, I purchased a pack of Arise from Helidank and I am super excited
[18:37.800 --> 18:39.020]  to grow those out.
[18:39.020 --> 18:43.100]  Well, thank you for purchasing those and thanks for having the enthusiasm about Arise.
[18:43.100 --> 18:48.220]  That is one of my favorite crosses, super high THC, super hyper vigor, just a great
[18:48.220 --> 18:49.220]  plant to grow overall.
[18:49.700 --> 18:54.540]  He goes on to say, I think I would like to cross a strong Indica to your Arise for my
[18:54.540 --> 18:55.780]  own personal use.
[18:55.780 --> 18:57.160]  And I do encourage breeding.
[18:57.160 --> 18:58.160]  Have fun with that.
[18:58.160 --> 18:59.660]  I have no problem with you using my stuff.
[18:59.660 --> 19:01.780]  Once you've bought my seeds, they're yours.
[19:01.780 --> 19:03.220]  Feel free to breed with it.
[19:03.220 --> 19:07.260]  However, make sure you give me credit when you post pictures or if those seeds go anywhere.
[19:07.260 --> 19:11.400]  Just make sure you put Arise in the little listing of what the cross is so that people
[19:11.400 --> 19:12.940]  know what you used.
[19:12.940 --> 19:13.940]  Let's continue with the email.
[19:13.940 --> 19:14.940]  Where was I?
[19:14.940 --> 19:19.980]  I know you are a big sativa guy, but I am wondering if you can suggest a strong Indica
[19:19.980 --> 19:25.420]  strain you think may be a good pairing to match with the Arise.
[19:25.420 --> 19:30.180]  He wraps up this email by saying, if you do end up reading this aloud, feel free to use
[19:30.180 --> 19:31.260]  my name.
[19:31.260 --> 19:32.780]  Thanks so much from Kevin.
[19:32.780 --> 19:35.660]  Hey, Kevin, thank you for the great email.
[19:35.660 --> 19:40.140]  Let's talk a little bit about a great pairing for Arise.
[19:40.140 --> 19:42.740]  Arise was bred from a golden goat female.
[19:42.860 --> 19:45.580]  It's got that tropical sativa flavor going on.
[19:45.580 --> 19:47.020]  It's got a really nice structure.
[19:47.020 --> 19:50.180]  It can take a lot of nutrients, really vigorous plant.
[19:50.180 --> 19:53.420]  It is also bred from a daybreaker male.
[19:53.420 --> 19:56.220]  Daybreaker is Kim D and Joseph OG.
[19:56.220 --> 20:02.100]  It sort of has a fresh tennis ball, fresh rubber kind of a smell, along with that OG
[20:02.100 --> 20:06.380]  cush, funky, dank, dirty feet kind of a smell.
[20:06.380 --> 20:08.300]  Arise is a very unique cross.
[20:08.300 --> 20:13.540]  It is very beautifully balanced 50-50 hybrid with very unique parents and grandparents.
[20:13.540 --> 20:15.620]  It is a really great cross in my opinion.
[20:15.620 --> 20:20.640]  That's why it works so perfectly for so many environments and it produces so well.
[20:20.640 --> 20:25.380]  You want to cross this Arise to something more Indica dominant to where you can create
[20:25.380 --> 20:28.120]  an Indica heavy product for yourself.
[20:28.120 --> 20:30.540]  You like to smoke more of an Indica type of a thing.
[20:30.540 --> 20:35.580]  I feel if you cross the Arise to something more Indica dominant, you could possibly carry
[20:35.620 --> 20:40.820]  that Arise potency, that Arise hyper vigor into something that is more Indica heavy,
[20:40.820 --> 20:43.140]  maybe something that grows shorter and squattier.
[20:43.140 --> 20:45.860]  You can get that Indica potency up a little bit.
[20:45.860 --> 20:47.660]  Let's talk about how you would do this.
[20:47.660 --> 20:53.180]  Do you intend to use an Arise male or do you intend to use an Arise female?
[20:53.180 --> 20:55.060]  That is the first thing you need to think about.
[20:55.060 --> 20:58.740]  The second thing I would think about is when it comes to the opposite, are you going to
[20:58.740 --> 21:01.220]  use another male or female?
[21:01.220 --> 21:02.740]  Where are you going to acquire this?
[21:02.740 --> 21:04.260]  Do you have access to good seeds?
[21:04.260 --> 21:09.620]  Do you have access to a large variety or is your access slightly limited?
[21:09.620 --> 21:13.880]  If you've only got access to clones, you're either going to be using this other cross
[21:13.880 --> 21:19.860]  as your pollen receiver as the female, or you may be making a feminized cross.
[21:19.860 --> 21:22.740]  There are a lot of variables to think about here.
[21:22.740 --> 21:28.020]  I'm trying to think of some of my favorite Indica heavy cultivars or varieties that are
[21:28.020 --> 21:30.900]  available that you may be able to get your hands on.
[21:30.900 --> 21:38.300]  Something I would honestly enjoy seeing work would be an Arise male put to an LA Confidential
[21:38.300 --> 21:40.580]  female from DNA Genetics.
[21:40.580 --> 21:43.740]  I think the progeny would be amazing.
[21:43.740 --> 21:48.900]  If you have access to LA Confidential from DNA Genetics, I would certainly recommend
[21:48.900 --> 21:49.900]  that.
[21:49.900 --> 21:55.180]  Another thing I would recommend would probably be the Cataract Kush or the Kosher Kush.
[21:55.180 --> 21:58.900]  I would love to find a good male of the Kosher Kush.
[21:58.900 --> 22:02.860]  Unfortunately, they are only selling those in feminized seeds at this time.
[22:02.860 --> 22:06.900]  Yes, I have considered getting a female or getting a clone and reversing it, but that
[22:06.900 --> 22:08.820]  is not what I want to do at this time.
[22:08.820 --> 22:14.980]  I would love to have a Kosher Kush male from the old school Kosher OG seeds that DNA released
[22:14.980 --> 22:15.980]  years ago.
[22:15.980 --> 22:16.980]  That is not an option.
[22:16.980 --> 22:22.420]  What I would like to see happen is you find a good male from that Arise pack and put that
[22:22.420 --> 22:26.940]  pollen on the Kosher, the Cataract, or the LA Confidential.
[22:27.540 --> 22:33.020]  All three of those are from DNA Genetics or Reserva Pravado, which is their little offshoot
[22:33.020 --> 22:34.020]  company.
[22:34.020 --> 22:35.740]  I really appreciate their Indica.
[22:35.740 --> 22:39.340]  I think they make a good OG Kush Indica kind of a line.
[22:39.340 --> 22:42.480]  I really respect those guys and all of their work.
[22:42.480 --> 22:46.900]  If you plan to use an Arise male, and you can't name him Solomon, that's mine.
[22:46.900 --> 22:49.500]  You got to come up with your own name, but you can still use an Arise male.
[22:49.500 --> 22:50.500]  That is fair.
[22:50.500 --> 22:55.120]  If you're going to use that, I would recommend pollinating something on the OG Kush heavy
[22:55.120 --> 22:59.800]  side if you want something more Indica dominant to come out of your cross.
[22:59.800 --> 23:03.960]  Something short, something stout, something with big fat leaves, something that doesn't
[23:03.960 --> 23:05.800]  take very long to flower.
[23:05.800 --> 23:09.720]  Maybe Bubba Kush would be a fun cross to go to the Arise.
[23:09.720 --> 23:11.560]  Now let's talk about the other way.
[23:11.560 --> 23:15.760]  Maybe you want to use an Arise female as your pollen receiver.
[23:15.760 --> 23:20.000]  I would still consider those first three strains I mentioned, the Cataract, the Kosher, and
[23:20.000 --> 23:21.480]  the LA Confidential.
[23:21.480 --> 23:26.740]  But I would also try to find something with big fat leaves, short and squat, with really
[23:26.740 --> 23:28.480]  Indica dominant traits.
[23:28.480 --> 23:30.720]  Again, I don't know what is available to you.
[23:30.720 --> 23:34.800]  I know you've got my seeds, so it sounds like you've got access to plenty of good seeds.
[23:34.800 --> 23:39.600]  I would find a super heavy Indica strain that gets your attention.
[23:39.600 --> 23:42.800]  Something that has the traits which you were looking for, because that is what you were
[23:42.800 --> 23:45.280]  going to get from your progeny.
[23:45.280 --> 23:46.840]  What you put in is what you get out.
[23:46.840 --> 23:49.960]  You're going to get 50% of the male, 50% of the female.
[23:49.960 --> 23:53.280]  You're going to mash it up, and you're going to get all kinds of different expressions
[23:53.280 --> 23:55.680]  of the different traits that are available.
[23:55.680 --> 24:00.960]  I would find a male with big fat leaves and a short squat stature, because that Arise
[24:00.960 --> 24:02.640]  probably gets fairly tall.
[24:02.640 --> 24:04.640]  It's probably got fairly skinny leaves.
[24:04.640 --> 24:06.360]  Like you said, it is Sativa dominant.
[24:06.360 --> 24:11.520]  You need to find something with heavy Indica genes, so that way you can dominate that cross.
[24:11.520 --> 24:17.000]  That way those Indica genes are real dominant, real prevalent in your cross, in your offspring.
[24:17.040 --> 24:21.040]  Something that just hit my mind, a strain that I should recommend, Durango OG.
[24:21.040 --> 24:25.520]  I think Durango OG would pair beautifully with the Arise.
[24:25.520 --> 24:26.760]  I'm kind of hosing myself.
[24:26.760 --> 24:30.560]  Now I can't make these crosses, since I'm giving everybody else the ideas, but I think
[24:30.560 --> 24:35.920]  Durango OG and Arise, either direction, either one is a male, either one is a female, I think
[24:35.920 --> 24:37.840]  they would both work beautifully.
[24:37.840 --> 24:42.400]  What would be fun is if you got a pack of seeds of Durango OG, you got a pack of seeds
[24:42.400 --> 24:46.880]  of Arise, and you grew both of them out, and you found a stellar male from each pack, and
[24:46.880 --> 24:48.520]  a stellar female from each pack.
[24:48.520 --> 24:53.040]  You've got a boy Arise and a girl Arise, and you've got a male Durango OG and a female
[24:53.040 --> 24:56.800]  Durango OG, then do two separate breeding projects.
[24:56.800 --> 25:01.640]  Cross the male Arise to the girl Durango, and the girl Arise to the male Durango, and
[25:01.640 --> 25:06.860]  then observe the differences in both of the progeny of your projects.
[25:06.860 --> 25:11.840]  Then you can really dial it in and find what you want for your personal medicine.
[25:11.840 --> 25:16.200]  To be quite honest with you, this breeding project, any kind of breeding Arise back to
[25:16.280 --> 25:19.080]  some Indica sounds like a very exciting project.
[25:19.080 --> 25:24.400]  I'm sure that if you start with a good, solid Indica plant that is either going to be the
[25:24.400 --> 25:29.760]  male or the female, I'm sure you will get something that satisfies you in the offspring.
[25:29.760 --> 25:33.280]  You will make a lot of seeds, you'll have a lot of stuff to play with, and something
[25:33.280 --> 25:36.120]  in that batch of seeds will be your keeper.
[25:36.120 --> 25:40.120]  I think cracking a pack of seeds is a lot like buying a pack of baseball cards, or I
[25:40.120 --> 25:42.960]  guess nowadays you'd say Magic the Gathering cards.
[25:42.960 --> 25:46.920]  When you open the pack, you go through, you always get a bunch of commons, maybe a couple
[25:46.920 --> 25:51.080]  of uncommons, but then toward the back, there's always that one rare card that you were super
[25:51.080 --> 25:52.360]  excited about.
[25:52.360 --> 25:55.880]  I hope you find your Mickey Mantle early on in your pheno hunt.
[25:55.880 --> 25:57.020]  That is the best part.
[25:57.020 --> 26:00.440]  You get to do the breeding, you get to do the male selection, the female selection,
[26:00.440 --> 26:04.040]  you get to do the pollen chucking, you get to watch all the time of those seeds develop,
[26:04.040 --> 26:05.240]  you get to harvest it.
[26:05.240 --> 26:09.760]  Then the funnest part, in my opinion, is growing out those seeds to see what you've got to
[26:09.760 --> 26:11.840]  look for that Mickey Mantle card.
[26:11.840 --> 26:13.640]  I really hope you enjoy this breeding project.
[26:13.640 --> 26:14.960]  I hope I gave you some good advice.
[26:14.960 --> 26:18.560]  I know I recommended a few strains, and I know I went both directions.
[26:18.560 --> 26:22.560]  I'm not sure your goal or your intention, other than to make an Indica-dominant cross
[26:22.560 --> 26:23.560]  from the arise.
[26:23.560 --> 26:25.440]  I hope I have led you in the right direction.
[26:25.440 --> 26:28.040]  A thank you for the great email.
[26:28.040 --> 26:31.880]  I really look forward to seeing pictures of the offspring.
[26:31.880 --> 26:35.440]  Once you make these seeds, I want you to grow them out, and then I want to see pictures.
[26:35.440 --> 26:36.440]  I want to get details.
[26:36.440 --> 26:37.520]  I want to know what male you used.
[26:37.520 --> 26:41.880]  I want to know what female you used, and I want to see how those seeds turn out for
[26:41.880 --> 26:42.880]  you.
[26:42.880 --> 26:43.880]  Thanks again for the great email, my friend.
