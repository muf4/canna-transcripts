[00:00.000 --> 00:02.240]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[00:02.240 --> 00:06.200]  It is time for episode 460 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.200 --> 00:08.760]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:08.760 --> 00:13.520]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:13.520 --> 00:21.400]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:21.400 --> 00:24.800]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:24.800 --> 00:30.120]  Today I've been taking dabs of Downshift Live Batter from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[00:30.120 --> 00:36.020]  This is a blend of Southbound and HSB, which is Han Solo Burger.
[00:36.020 --> 00:39.300]  The label describes the flavor as gas, earth, and hazelnut.
[00:39.300 --> 00:40.640]  I definitely get the gas.
[00:40.640 --> 00:42.340]  I absolutely get the earth.
[00:42.340 --> 00:46.740]  I am not sure that I tasted hazelnut, although it was extremely delicious.
[00:46.740 --> 00:54.240]  The potency label says that this concentrate contains 67.99% THC and zero CBD.
[00:54.240 --> 00:58.800]  I really enjoy the flavor, and I really like the great eye buzz and the face buzz from
[00:58.800 --> 01:01.000]  the Downshift Live Batter.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.220]  I'm going to crack this open so we can take a look.
[01:03.220 --> 01:05.000]  The consistency is beautiful.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.880]  It looks like I've got a piece of really soft cheese or maybe a nice golden colored chunk
[01:10.880 --> 01:11.880]  of cheesecake.
[01:11.880 --> 01:14.080]  I'm giving it a fresh smell.
[01:14.080 --> 01:16.060]  You know, I still don't get the hazelnut.
[01:16.060 --> 01:19.320]  There may be a hint of lavender or something in there, but I'm not getting hazelnut out
[01:19.320 --> 01:20.320]  of that.
[01:20.320 --> 01:21.320]  I'm not complaining.
[01:21.320 --> 01:22.320]  I love the aroma.
[01:22.320 --> 01:24.160]  I love the flavor, and I love the buzz.
[01:24.200 --> 01:29.200]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious and amazing Downshift
[01:29.200 --> 01:30.200]  Live Batter.
[01:30.200 --> 01:32.440]  All right, podcast world.
[01:32.440 --> 01:36.120]  In this Thursday episode of the show, I'm going to talk about a couple of great events
[01:36.120 --> 01:37.400]  I got to attend recently.
[01:37.400 --> 01:38.560]  I got to see Joe Rogan.
[01:38.560 --> 01:40.760]  I also got to go see Phish for three days.
[01:40.760 --> 01:42.200]  I'm going to talk about that.
[01:42.200 --> 01:43.400]  I may get to an email.
[01:43.400 --> 01:44.760]  We may get to a couple of questions.
[01:44.760 --> 01:48.260]  It depends on how my voice does and how long this show goes.
[01:48.260 --> 01:53.400]  Before we get to that part, let's do some shout outs to our friends from Patreon.
[01:53.760 --> 01:55.840]  I want to start off with a giant thank you shout out to my friend St. Stephen.
[01:55.840 --> 01:59.720]  I want to give a giant thank you shout out to my friend Jacob W.
[01:59.720 --> 02:01.580]  Also a giant shout out to Keith K.
[02:01.580 --> 02:05.160]  I want to send a big grow from your heart podcast shoutout to Brett G.
[02:05.160 --> 02:06.800]  I want to send a big thank you to Tommy!
[02:06.800 --> 02:11.000]  How about a giant grow from your heart podcast fist bump and a thank you to Glenn G.
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.760]  Also a giant thank you to Victor!
[02:12.760 --> 02:16.400]  I want to send a giant grow from your heart podcast thank you and a shout out to Steve
[02:16.400 --> 02:17.400]  F.
[02:17.400 --> 02:19.360]  As always, a giant thank you to Sour Dee.
[02:19.360 --> 02:23.280]  And last, but certainly not least, I want to give a shout out and a Grow From Your Heart
[02:23.280 --> 02:28.160]  podcast shout out and a thank you to our friend Baz. I want to thank each and every one of you

[02:44.960 --> 02:49.840]  about some of the fun stuff I've gotten to do recently. A couple of weeks ago, my friend Clint
[02:49.840 --> 02:56.720]  and I got to go see Joe Rogan at the Belco Theater in Denver, Colorado. That was a great time. It was
[02:56.720 --> 03:02.000]  a great event. I had a great time riding up with Clint. Clint is not a heavy cannabis consumer.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.200]  I may have parked the car and safely taken a dab before we went into the event. And I think
[03:07.200 --> 03:11.920]  Clint may have gotten a little extra buzzed off my dab. So that was entertaining. We got to the
[03:11.920 --> 03:16.640]  event way too early. I wasn't exactly sure where the theater was. I had no idea how long it was
[03:16.640 --> 03:22.080]  going to take me to get there. We drive about 130 miles for these shows. Sometimes it could take us
[03:22.080 --> 03:25.760]  two hours to get there. Sometimes it can take three and a half hours to get there. I leave
[03:25.760 --> 03:31.760]  plenty early. There was no traffic. So we were there quite early. We went to go find the Belco
[03:31.760 --> 03:37.920]  Theater and we discovered that the Belco Theater is actually inside of the Denver Convention Center.
[03:37.920 --> 03:43.520]  The Denver Convention Center is about the size of two city blocks in Denver. So if you live in a
[03:43.520 --> 03:48.720]  small or normal city, that is probably three or four blocks and it is one building. It is a
[03:48.720 --> 03:54.960]  gigantic, tremendous building. It's a little bit overwhelming. There are several different halls
[03:54.960 --> 03:59.360]  inside of this building. They can hold multiple different concerts and conventions and events
[03:59.360 --> 04:03.840]  inside of this building. Clint and I showed up quite early. There were not a lot of people in
[04:03.840 --> 04:09.760]  the building. We basically had free range of this giant convention center to ourselves. We were a
[04:09.760 --> 04:15.200]  little bit baked and we just walked around and checked out. Some areas had really great artwork.
[04:16.240 --> 04:21.360]  In one area, they had a bunch of license plates pinned to the wall. So some areas had great
[04:21.360 --> 04:25.680]  artwork. Some places, it looked like a shitty old bar. We found a bunch of weird hallways that
[04:26.240 --> 04:32.160]  just connected weird, unnecessary hallways that connected areas to areas. It was just really fun
[04:32.160 --> 04:35.360]  walking around this giant building where there were no other people.
[04:35.360 --> 04:39.280]  Sometimes a couple of security guards would come out of nowhere and follow us. They would stay
[04:39.280 --> 04:42.400]  back and not bother us, but you could tell they were keeping an eye on us, making sure we weren't
[04:42.400 --> 04:46.880]  doing anything stupid. We were not threatening. We were just bored, killing time, a little bit
[04:46.880 --> 04:51.200]  baked, laughing about the building. There was one area where I said it looked like a scene from Tony
[04:51.200 --> 04:56.000]  Hawk's Pro Skater. There were just skate lines everywhere. You could go down the rail there,
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.160]  go up the rail there, go across the wall there, go over there, come back down that way. It was
[05:00.160 --> 05:04.720]  just really an interesting building. The carpet was amazing. The lighting was amazing. The place
[05:04.720 --> 05:10.320]  was gigantic. There were convention halls and there were full food courts inside of this building.
[05:10.320 --> 05:14.320]  It was like a giant mall with a giant building with a giant building inside of it. It was
[05:14.320 --> 05:19.520]  tremendous. Anyway, eventually it was time to go see Joe Rogan. So we headed toward the area where
[05:19.520 --> 05:23.280]  we thought Joe Rogan was performing. You got to go through a little security area. They run you
[05:23.280 --> 05:28.240]  through a metal detector. They did not care if you had a vape pen on you. Several people were inside
[05:28.240 --> 05:34.960]  of the show smoking out of a vape pen. We didn't realize that once we got past that security area,
[05:34.960 --> 05:39.520]  we had to get into another line. Then we're thinking, where is this theater? It looks like
[05:39.520 --> 05:44.080]  it might be in this little section of this building in which we are in. Once we get past
[05:44.080 --> 05:48.960]  the security line and past another line, they check our tickets and we go in. There was another
[05:48.960 --> 05:56.560]  complete 5,000 capacity theater hidden in the small bottom corner of this building. It was amazing
[05:56.560 --> 06:01.360]  to walk into this door and realize, holy shit, there is a giant theater in here.
[06:01.920 --> 06:06.960]  There was a sign right there by the door as I walked in and it said, capacity, 5,005 people.
[06:07.600 --> 06:13.440]  The theater itself was huge. Imagine how big the building itself had to be if there was a 5,000
[06:13.440 --> 06:19.760]  person venue just gently tucked into one small corner of the enormous multiple city block
[06:19.760 --> 06:25.040]  building. It was a giant place. It was a really cool theater. There were plenty of concessions,
[06:25.040 --> 06:28.880]  so you didn't have to stand in line to get a drink or to get a snack. Luckily,
[06:28.880 --> 06:32.640]  neither Clint or I drink alcohol, so we just jump in line and get a bottle of water. It doesn't
[06:32.640 --> 06:37.440]  take any time. We were politely escorted to our seats. We had very nice seats. I do very well when
[06:37.440 --> 06:41.520]  I buy comedy show tickets and concert tickets. I like to be down in the front. I like to see the
[06:41.520 --> 06:46.320]  action. We got down in the front there. We got to see several good comedians. Let's get into that
[06:46.320 --> 06:50.000]  part. There was an opener. I cannot think of her name right now. I should do her the respect of
[06:50.000 --> 06:54.640]  pressing pause and finding her name. Let's do that. All right. The great comedian who opened
[06:54.640 --> 06:59.760]  for Mr. Joe Rogan, her name was Allie Makovsky. She was fucking hilarious, you guys. That's why
[06:59.760 --> 07:04.320]  I wanted to take a moment and find out her name. She deserves some respect and some promotion.
[07:04.320 --> 07:09.520]  If you are a comedy fan and you have not found out about Allie Makovsky, now is the time.
[07:09.520 --> 07:15.040]  Give her a look. She's fucking hilarious. Ms. Allie Makovsky comes out. She did a few minutes.
[07:15.040 --> 07:18.800]  Her microphone could have been a little bit louder. Other than that, I think she did a really
[07:18.800 --> 07:24.400]  good job. There's something that happens when you do comedy in a giant theater. You tell the joke,
[07:24.720 --> 07:27.840]  people in the front row hear you, and then the people in the middle hear you,
[07:27.840 --> 07:32.560]  then the people in the back hear you. The laughter goes toward the back, but then it's
[07:32.560 --> 07:37.200]  a weird thing. It hits the back and it moves back toward the front. Then it goes up to the balcony,
[07:37.200 --> 07:40.960]  and then it moves out, and then it comes back around. It takes a really long time
[07:41.520 --> 07:47.360]  for the laughter to stop in a big theater like that. That's not a bad thing. Laughter is great.
[07:47.360 --> 07:52.000]  It's great when a comedian gets a big laugh, but it messes up the timing of telling a joke.
[07:52.000 --> 07:56.320]  Usually, you could say, I don't even have a good joke in mind. Knock, knock, who's there? Punch
[07:56.320 --> 08:00.240]  line, the laughter, and then you go, ha ha, blah, blah, blah, next line to keep the laughter going.
[08:00.240 --> 08:05.200]  That's called a tagline. In a big theater, you have to say, knock, knock, you wait a long time.
[08:05.200 --> 08:10.480]  Then you say, who's there? Then you say, the answer, ha ha ha, and then everybody laughs for
[08:10.480 --> 08:14.080]  a long time. If you want to throw in another tagline to stick it and make it laugh a little
[08:14.080 --> 08:18.960]  bit harder, you really have to be patient and let all that big rumble of laughter subside
[08:18.960 --> 08:22.480]  so that you've got the audience's attention again, and they don't have to hear you
[08:22.480 --> 08:26.800]  over that laughter. If you're going to throw on another tag, you really have to be patient.
[08:26.800 --> 08:33.840]  That changes the dynamic of comedy in a big theater. I think that Ali is learning how to
[08:33.840 --> 08:38.000]  manage a large crowd like that. She wasn't quite patient enough on some of the jokes.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.760]  She could have let the laughter go. We would have laughed a little longer and a little harder
[08:41.760 --> 08:44.960]  had she given us the opportunity. That's something she needs to learn.
[08:44.960 --> 08:49.280]  Other than that, her material was great. Her approach, her delivery was all perfect. She
[08:49.280 --> 08:54.160]  just needs to adjust to the size of that club. She's very young and very new. If that's her
[08:54.160 --> 09:00.000]  only problem, she is going to be a fantastic comedian. Make sure you guys check out Ali
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.360]  Makovsky. I really did enjoy her comedy. Then the next comedian that took the stage
[09:05.360 --> 09:10.560]  really blew my mind. Recently, I have fallen in love with a podcast called Whiskey Ginger.
[09:10.560 --> 09:15.600]  I've been paying attention to everything that this comedian does. I was really excited when
[09:15.600 --> 09:20.480]  Ali wrapped up her set and she said, ladies and gentlemen, this next comedian is the host
[09:20.480 --> 09:27.120]  of the Whiskey Ginger podcast. I'd like to bring to the stage Andrew Santino. I was fucking excited,
[09:27.120 --> 09:32.240]  to tell you the truth. I think I knew that Santino was going to be the middle act. I think I remember
[09:32.240 --> 09:36.960]  Rogan saying something about it on the podcast, or maybe Santino said something about it on one
[09:36.960 --> 09:41.600]  of the many podcasts he's been on, but I had forgotten about it. I was so excited. I was so
[09:41.600 --> 09:45.920]  distracted by the day and just the excitement of going to Denver and seeing Rogan that I think it
[09:45.920 --> 09:50.240]  totally slipped my mind that Santino would be the middle act. I really thought that it was going to
[09:50.240 --> 09:54.880]  be Ian Edwards. I was excited to see Ian Edwards. You guys, if you're not an Ian Edwards fan and you
[09:54.880 --> 09:58.320]  don't know who Ian Edwards is, you should check him out. He's got a comedy special coming out
[09:58.320 --> 10:03.040]  very soon if it's not out already. I definitely recommend you check out Ian Edwards. Don't slip
[10:03.040 --> 10:08.800]  on him. But I was really excited to find out that Santino was the middle act. Andrew Santino is
[10:08.800 --> 10:12.960]  fucking hilarious. They call him Cheeto because he's a ginger. He's got bright orange hair.
[10:12.960 --> 10:18.320]  He does not do too many jokes capitalizing on his gingerness, which I think is really good.
[10:18.320 --> 10:23.120]  I think it's cheap when a comedian uses one physical feature and focuses too much on that
[10:23.120 --> 10:27.200]  for their comedy. I've always said that if I did stand-up comedy, I would not do
[10:27.200 --> 10:31.360]  weed humor, which I think would be really funny. It would be too direct if I went up on stage and
[10:31.360 --> 10:35.120]  told a bunch of pot jokes. That's just way too easy. It's too cliche. It's too simple.
[10:35.840 --> 10:40.800]  That would be easy. I would have to make a better approach, more effort, do something original if I
[10:40.800 --> 10:45.440]  did comedy. Anyway, I'm getting off track here. I really loved Santino's comedy. He opened up,
[10:46.080 --> 10:49.280]  started talking about potheads and how he hates potheads. He said,
[10:49.280 --> 10:54.160]  fuck Sublime. Sublime is the worst band on the planet. I thought that was really fucking funny.
[10:54.960 --> 11:02.320]  On his podcast recently, he did a really long rant about fuck white people with dreadlocks.
[11:02.320 --> 11:10.240]  Of course, you guys know I am a white guy with dreadlocks to my fucking knees. I don't get
[11:10.240 --> 11:13.840]  offended when people say fuck white people with dreadlocks. You can't have dreadlocks and be
[11:13.840 --> 11:17.760]  offended by people who don't like dreadlocks. That is part of having dreadlocks. If you don't
[11:17.760 --> 11:23.840]  like me because I've got dreadlocks, that makes it easier because I don't have to have fake friends.
[11:24.800 --> 11:31.360]  Anyway, Santino was joking. He's a comedian. His job is to make jokes. I laughed a lot at his shit
[11:31.360 --> 11:35.120]  talking about white people with dreadlocks. Honestly, most of it was fucking accurate,
[11:35.120 --> 11:38.720]  so I couldn't even be mad. Half of the jokes people make about white people with dreadlocks
[11:38.720 --> 11:43.120]  are fucking true. I can't be offended. I think it's funny. I really love comedy. I think if you
[11:43.120 --> 11:48.160]  get offended by comedy, you're doing it wrong. You went to a comedy show, somebody's telling a joke,
[11:48.160 --> 11:52.160]  your job is to laugh. If you go to a TED Talk and get offended, that is totally different.
[11:52.160 --> 11:55.920]  That's an educational thing. Somebody's speaking, you may be offended there. Comedy,
[11:55.920 --> 12:01.280]  shut the fuck up and laugh. That is your job. What I'm getting at is after I heard Santino do
[12:01.280 --> 12:06.480]  his 30-minute rant on his podcast about fuck white people with dreadlocks, he wrapped it all up by
[12:06.480 --> 12:10.000]  saying, you guys, you know I'm a comedian. This is a joke. I love white people with dreadlocks.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.680]  Don't take it personally. I already knew that, but he had to wrap it up just for the people
[12:13.680 --> 12:20.000]  that don't get it. I thought it was hilarious. I hilariously tweeted Santino. I said, hey, Andrew,
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.240]  it's okay. I forgive you for the things you said about white people with dreadlocks in today's
[12:24.240 --> 12:31.600]  podcast. He liked it. He was telling his joke about fuck Sublime, fuck potheads. Sublime is
[12:31.600 --> 12:36.720]  the worst band ever. Then he looked over toward me, and I think he may have been thinking about
[12:36.720 --> 12:41.040]  ranting about white people with dreadlocks, but he looked at me and just smiled and nodded his head
[12:41.040 --> 12:45.280]  and took a drink of his drink and changed directions in his comedy. It was really funny
[12:45.280 --> 12:49.520]  that he came out immediately and ranted about fuck potheads. He's like, potheads are fucking
[12:49.520 --> 12:53.840]  annoying. He's like, you can smoke pot and not be annoying. I'm doing it right now. I thought it was
[12:53.840 --> 12:58.560]  really funny because I'm a pothead, and you got to admit, some of us are fucking annoying.
[12:58.560 --> 13:03.600]  So Santino was hilarious, you guys. I have never seen Andrew Santino do stand-up comedy. I know
[13:03.600 --> 13:08.480]  that Santino is about to start doing a TV show. He has been saying that he's going to be busy for
[13:08.480 --> 13:12.560]  several months. He's going to take a break from comedy. So it was a great honor and a great
[13:12.640 --> 13:20.080]  privilege to see Andrew Chido Santino do live stand-up comedy in Denver. I was nicely baked.
[13:20.080 --> 13:26.560]  It was a great surprise. That was awesome. Then you know what happened next. They brought out
[13:26.560 --> 13:35.120]  one of the funniest motherfuckers on the planet. Mr. Joe fucking Rogan came out and destroyed that
[13:35.120 --> 13:42.160]  fucking theater. I laughed until my stomach hurt. I laughed until my cheeks hurt. My face felt weird.
[13:42.160 --> 13:46.000]  When you laugh a lot, I do. At least I get a little weird headache at the top of my head if
[13:46.000 --> 13:51.120]  I laugh too hard. I laughed until I felt fucking strange. It was such a good time.
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.200]  The only part that sucked, there was some asshole to the back right of Clint and I
[13:57.200 --> 14:01.600]  who had a response for everything Rogan said. If Rogan said, I like cake, that guy would say,
[14:01.600 --> 14:04.880]  brownies are better. If Rogan said, what's up, you bad motherfuckers, he would say,
[14:04.880 --> 14:09.200]  I'm right here, motherfucker. And it got annoying. Eventually, I think somebody had to have said
[14:09.200 --> 14:13.760]  something to him because he stopped. He totally went silent. I think either security or other
[14:14.480 --> 14:18.320]  audience members were like, shut the fuck up, dude, because it was getting obnoxious.
[14:19.120 --> 14:24.720]  My only real complaint about that theater is the sound is too low. They need to turn it up.
[14:24.720 --> 14:29.920]  There is a very fine line with standup comedy. You have to keep the volume at a certain level
[14:29.920 --> 14:36.320]  because if you turn it up too loud, it encourages people to talk. There's a thing that happens.
[14:36.320 --> 14:41.280]  When the comedian is loud enough to where you can hear him over me chattering, I feel comfortable
[14:41.280 --> 14:45.280]  chattering. But if you turn it down to where I can't chatter over it to where you hear me,
[14:45.280 --> 14:49.440]  it makes me uncomfortable to talk. So I shut the fuck up and let the comedian do his job.
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.160]  There's also a thing where the comedians are stoned and they're talking with a lot of passion
[14:54.160 --> 14:57.760]  and the microphone goes far from their face and the microphone comes close to their face and it
[14:57.760 --> 15:01.920]  goes far from their face. Sometimes you can't hear some of the little things they say when it's down
[15:01.920 --> 15:07.120]  quiet. That bothered me a little bit. I had to listen too closely to hear everything that
[15:07.120 --> 15:11.280]  Rogan said. So I wish they would have turned the volume up just a little tiny bit. Also,
[15:11.280 --> 15:15.120]  I was in the very front. So some of the sound from the sound system was going right over my
[15:15.120 --> 15:20.080]  head. I wasn't even getting the sound. I was mostly getting the sound that came from Rogan's mouth.
[15:20.080 --> 15:24.320]  So once the crowd got cheering or laughing, sometimes you would get drowned out a little
[15:24.320 --> 15:29.200]  bit. That was a little bit frustrating. But 99% of the time I could hear what was going on and it
[15:29.200 --> 15:34.560]  was fucking hilarious. Rogan started out by apologizing to any of the women who were in the
[15:34.560 --> 15:39.760]  crowd who were dragged there by their stupid husbands who listened to the fucking podcast.
[15:39.760 --> 15:44.240]  And I thought that was hilarious because honestly, that was a third of the crowd. It was a sausage
[15:44.240 --> 15:48.800]  fest. It was mostly bros, but the women that were there looked like fucking, he drug me to this
[15:48.800 --> 15:52.080]  fucking comedy show. I have to listen to him all the time in the car. I listened to him in the
[15:52.080 --> 15:56.400]  garage and I'm fucking here watching. And that was exactly the joke and that was what those women
[15:56.400 --> 16:02.880]  looked like. And it was fucking hilarious. So Ali was hilarious. Chido Santino is fucking hilarious.
[16:02.880 --> 16:08.080]  And Mr. Joe Rogan blew the goddamn roof off the building. He made me laugh my ass off.
[16:08.720 --> 16:12.800]  That was the first time I saw Rogan in person without a hat. I've seen Joe Rogan several times
[16:12.800 --> 16:16.480]  do comedy. That time he did not have a hat. You know what? I've seen him do without a hat before,
[16:16.480 --> 16:21.600]  but I was a little further back. That man is shaped like a damn troll. He is as wide as he
[16:21.600 --> 16:26.960]  is tall. I think he's five feet tall and I think he's five feet wide. He is pure muscle. I wasn't
[16:26.960 --> 16:31.760]  checking him out. You could tell he's nothing but fucking muscle. The dude is so ripped and so buff.
[16:31.760 --> 16:35.600]  He wears a nice collared shirt. He looks nice on stage. He's wearing jeans that are, I think
[16:35.600 --> 16:39.440]  they're stretchy jeans because his thighs are fucking wider than both of my legs, but he's
[16:39.440 --> 16:43.440]  wearing stretchy jeans and he's wearing a nice button up shirt. It's baby blue. It looks real
[16:43.440 --> 16:49.520]  good on him, but he can't fucking button the sleeves because his wrists are so big. This
[16:49.600 --> 16:54.240]  dude is shaped like a goddamn troll, but Joe Rogan killed it. He got sweaty as fuck. He drools a
[16:54.240 --> 16:58.400]  little bit. It's pretty funny to see. You don't get to see that on the podcast. You don't get to
[16:58.400 --> 17:02.800]  see the drool and you get to watch him catch a buzz. I really like watching the comedians come
[17:02.800 --> 17:06.400]  out mostly sober and they drink a little whiskey throughout the show. By the end, they're like,
[17:06.400 --> 17:11.280]  I'm fucking rowdy and drunk. I really enjoyed seeing that from Rogan. Great show. I got to go
[17:11.280 --> 17:17.280]  with my buddy Clint. Dude, Clint is such a great road dog for comedy shows. Clint shows up on time.
[17:17.280 --> 17:22.320]  Clint brings his own cannabis products. Clint brings his own snacks. Clint offers gas money.
[17:22.320 --> 17:26.080]  When we stopped at the gas station and stopped to get snacks, Clint bought my snacks and drinks
[17:26.080 --> 17:30.560]  because I drove and bought the tickets. Clint's a bad motherfucker. Clint doesn't need to stop
[17:30.560 --> 17:35.360]  and take extra pisses. Clint has no problems. We walked around Denver and had a good ass time.
[17:35.360 --> 17:39.360]  Clint didn't need a sweater. He didn't wear shoes that hurt his feet. Clint was a bad
[17:39.360 --> 17:43.200]  motherfucker to go to a comedy show with. Big shout out to my buddy, Clint. We're going to do
[17:43.200 --> 17:49.760]  more shows pretty soon here. After the comedy show, I don't know that we were lost, but I do
[17:49.760 --> 17:54.800]  know that we don't remember exactly where the car was. We know where the car was. I just don't know
[17:54.800 --> 17:59.440]  that we knew how to get to it. It wasn't an issue because we're two grown men in Denver and we're
[17:59.440 --> 18:03.920]  like, let's just fucking walk around and find the car. There were plenty of interesting people to
[18:03.920 --> 18:09.280]  look at. Denver has its own brand of freaks and weirdos and unique people. We just roamed around
[18:09.280 --> 18:13.600]  and did a couple of laps around the building. We ran into a few friends that knew who I was,
[18:14.320 --> 18:17.440]  ran into some folks. I didn't know who they were, but they knew who I was.
[18:17.440 --> 18:23.280]  Then we ran into the always wonderful Tenasi and his pops and his lovely girlfriend. They were
[18:23.280 --> 18:27.280]  great to hang out with. It was great to see them. I got to introduce my buddy, Clint, to my friend,
[18:27.280 --> 18:31.920]  Tenasi. That was fun. Big shout out to my buddy, Tenasi at Tenasi Gardens. If you're not following
[18:31.920 --> 18:37.360]  Tenasi, give him a follow. Great girl. We're a great dude. Then we found the car and we drove
[18:37.360 --> 18:45.680]  home. That was a very successful Joe Rogan comedy experience. Then the next weekend, I got to go see
[18:45.680 --> 18:52.960]  my favorite band on the damn planet, the best band in the world. I got to go see Fish at Dix
[18:52.960 --> 19:00.240]  in Denver. Dix is a giant soccer field. It holds about 27,000 people. They sold out three nights.
[19:00.240 --> 19:05.360]  They did Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. Of course, I went to all three shows. You never
[19:05.360 --> 19:11.200]  miss a Colorado show when Fish comes. Fish weekend was a great time. That is my release.
[19:11.200 --> 19:17.040]  That is my vacation of the year. That is where I cut loose. That is what I work hard for all year,
[19:17.040 --> 19:20.960]  to where I can just go for three days and have a good time. It actually turns out being a four
[19:20.960 --> 19:25.440]  or five-day trip. It starts a day early. Then after the Fish shows, I always need another day
[19:25.440 --> 19:31.040]  to recover. Re-entry is a struggle at some points. I've been gone having fun, living in a hotel room,
[19:31.040 --> 19:35.440]  partying on a parking lot, hanging out with my best friends, smoking dank all day,
[19:35.440 --> 19:38.960]  doing whatever else we do, and seeing the best band on the planet all night.
[19:38.960 --> 19:42.480]  Then after the band plays, we go and dance somewhere else and do more shit.
[19:42.480 --> 19:47.600]  So coming back to reality can be a little bit of a bitch after that. But the Fish weekend was
[19:47.600 --> 19:52.960]  amazing. It was three days and three nights of amazing music. Such a good time. I got to see
[19:52.960 --> 19:58.000]  so many of my good friends. There are some people that I only see on a yearly basis when they come
[19:58.000 --> 20:02.560]  through for Fish or when I go to Fish and bump into them there. So it was a really good time to
[20:02.560 --> 20:07.680]  see those folks. There are folks that I've seen every year at Dix for four or five years. This
[20:07.680 --> 20:12.640]  was the ninth year that the band has played there. So we have developed a nice little family.
[20:12.640 --> 20:16.800]  We've got a little community that goes on within the Fish community. Then we've got our own little
[20:16.800 --> 20:21.920]  sub Denver, Colorado Fish community. Then there's an extra little sub community of the ganja
[20:21.920 --> 20:26.240]  industry that goes to the Fish shows. So there was a little... On one day, there was a cool little
[20:26.240 --> 20:31.040]  gathering of a bunch of ganja growers and ganja industry folks. We all hung out and smoked out
[20:31.040 --> 20:34.480]  together. That was nice. We'll talk more about the people that I got to hang out with here.
[20:35.040 --> 20:39.440]  So let's talk about the Fish shows. I get down, you guys. I don't go down into the front on the
[20:39.440 --> 20:43.440]  floor anymore. I'm getting a little bit older. I like to have a little bit of personal space at the
[20:43.440 --> 20:49.360]  concert. I am six foot five. I've got really long arms. I got really long dreadlocks. I pull my arms
[20:49.360 --> 20:52.960]  out and I spin around in a circle like I'm a plane flying around, like I'm a little kid having a good
[20:52.960 --> 20:57.200]  time. That is my release at a Fish show. So I like to go toward the back and have some fun and
[20:57.200 --> 21:01.680]  not spill drinks with my dreads, not bump into people. I was getting down. I was dancing. I was
[21:01.680 --> 21:05.280]  having a good ass time. And one of the security ladies came up to me and she's like, hey, would
[21:05.280 --> 21:09.760]  you like a floor pass? And I was like, no, no, thank you. She wanted to give me a floor pass so
[21:09.760 --> 21:13.520]  that I could get down on the floor and boogie a little closer to the band. And I said, no,
[21:13.520 --> 21:17.840]  my hair is too long and my arms are too long. I just go down there and spill everybody's drinks.
[21:17.840 --> 21:21.600]  And she laughed at me and gave me a hug. And she said, you guys are so nice.
[21:21.600 --> 21:26.160]  And she meant everybody at the Fish show. We're super kind people. We're there to have a good
[21:26.160 --> 21:29.440]  time. We're there to help each other out. On Friday night, some of my friends brought their
[21:29.440 --> 21:33.840]  children and there were two of them and they've got three children. So they were outnumbered.
[21:33.840 --> 21:38.320]  There were no questions that everybody around us will help you keep an eye on those kids. Let's
[21:38.320 --> 21:42.480]  all have fun. And if anybody sees a kid that needs help or see something that needs to be said or
[21:42.480 --> 21:46.400]  done, we've all got your back. Let's all have fun. We're not going to make the parents just struggle
[21:46.400 --> 21:50.640]  by themselves. And it was unspoken, but it all worked out. Those kids had a great time. The
[21:50.640 --> 21:54.400]  parents had a great time. There were a couple of moments, of course, you got kids, but it was a
[21:54.400 --> 21:57.920]  great time. So we take good care of each other. We're not there to push and shove. We're not there
[21:57.920 --> 22:01.920]  to fuck things up. We're there to get down on some music and spread some good vibes and recharge our
[22:01.920 --> 22:06.880]  soul. So I was getting down by myself, backed up a little bit. And that lady wanted to give me that
[22:06.880 --> 22:11.200]  floor pass, but I declined because I did not want to go down on the floor and bump into everybody.
[22:11.200 --> 22:14.880]  So she gave me a hug. She walked away. I continued dancing like a silly hippie.
[22:14.880 --> 22:19.280]  I've got my vape pen in my hand. I'm smoking on a Green Dot vape pen filled with Green Dot
[22:19.280 --> 22:23.040]  concentrates, just sucking on this thing like it's a pacifier, having a good old time.
[22:23.040 --> 22:26.320]  I'm not paying much attention. I'm into the music. I'm getting my groove on.
[22:26.320 --> 22:32.240]  And here comes a real sheriff, not a security guard, not like event staff, but a sheriff. He
[22:32.240 --> 22:37.600]  has got a gun. He has got mace. He's got handcuffs. He's got a badge. He's got a mustache. He's got
[22:37.600 --> 22:43.840]  cop glasses. I'm getting down. I'm ripping my vape pen. And this sheriff stopped directly in front of
[22:43.840 --> 22:50.800]  me and made eye contact with me, squared up with me, and began to dance like a fucking hippie.
[22:50.800 --> 22:55.120]  This sheriff was boogieing with me. We were getting down. He was making eye contact with
[22:55.120 --> 23:00.080]  me through his glasses and dancing like a hippie. I went a little low. He went a little low. I went
[23:00.080 --> 23:06.240]  back up. He went back up. I was laughing inside so hard. I had my vape pen in my hand. I figured
[23:06.240 --> 23:09.520]  the only thing to do was offer it to him. So I just reached out a little bit with it. Like,
[23:09.520 --> 23:12.960]  you want to hit this, sir? And he just laughed so hard and shook his head,
[23:12.960 --> 23:17.440]  put his hand on my shoulder like, you're a funny fucking guy, and walked away. It was one of the
[23:17.440 --> 23:22.320]  funniest experiences I've ever had. That's what it's like at a fish show. Security tries to give
[23:22.320 --> 23:28.480]  you passes you're not supposed to have. Cops dance with you. It was really fun. I stayed basically in
[23:28.480 --> 23:32.720]  the same spot for all three nights, so all of my friends knew where I was. I had a nice little
[23:32.720 --> 23:37.040]  location. I didn't have to move. Throughout the three nights, everybody just circled by and gave
[23:37.040 --> 23:41.840]  me a hug, gave me a high five, said, what's up? I get down. I like to boogie right there. I create
[23:41.840 --> 23:45.920]  a little dance space and a little vibe. And if you go start the party and start dancing by yourself
[23:45.920 --> 23:49.600]  right there, all of the other hippies want to come and dance with you. So I had a nice little
[23:49.600 --> 23:54.080]  dance party going on in my area once again. A bunch of hippie dudes, a bunch of hippie girls
[23:54.080 --> 23:59.120]  just spinning with me. A nice little rotation of people come and go. My friends come and go and say,
[23:59.120 --> 24:03.360]  hi, come give me a high five, come give me a hug. It is such a great time. It's kind of like a
[24:03.360 --> 24:08.080]  recharge. I say that it's like therapy and church all rolled into one. I feel so much better after
[24:08.080 --> 24:12.480]  going and just shaking my booty for three nights to my favorite band. I'm not going to get too much
[24:12.480 --> 24:18.080]  into the actual music that Phish played. Most people here do not care about Phish. They played
[24:18.080 --> 24:23.040]  excellent music, you guys. I know every time I go see Phish, I say they were great. One night,
[24:23.040 --> 24:28.240]  they reached a new level, which I've never heard Phish reach. Phish has four members. It sounded
[24:28.240 --> 24:32.960]  like there were about 20 members on the stage. It was fucking insane. It was really killer.
[24:33.040 --> 24:37.040]  The music was top notch. They did some great music. Most of you guys don't care about that,
[24:37.040 --> 24:39.920]  so we're going to skip that part. That's what needs to be said about the music.
[24:40.480 --> 24:45.680]  What else? What else? After the concert, every night after the show, there was a party on the
[24:45.680 --> 24:51.440]  parking lot. That's how it goes when you see Phish. But the highlight for me was, that's a
[24:51.440 --> 24:56.240]  debate. There is a marching band that shows up at all of the shows and they play funk tunes and
[24:56.240 --> 25:00.080]  they play Phish tunes marching band style. They got a dude with a bass drum. They got a dude with
[25:00.080 --> 25:04.640]  a snare drum, a nice horn section. They march around and they play a bunch of really groovy
[25:04.640 --> 25:11.600]  tunes and we dance to them. Also, a bunch of my friends from Lawrence, Kansas have a car. It is
[25:11.600 --> 25:17.120]  either a Ford Ranchero or a Chevy El Camino. I honestly didn't pay enough attention. I may have
[25:17.120 --> 25:22.960]  been lit. But the back of this vehicle is turned into a ball pit. It looks like a Chuck E. Cheese
[25:22.960 --> 25:28.480]  ball pit. They have filled the back with colorful balls. They hung a disco ball above the ball pit.
[25:28.480 --> 25:34.000]  Then they have souped up the vehicle with an amazing sound system. The guys that run this
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.400]  vehicle and run the sound system know exactly what music to play to get the party started.
[25:38.400 --> 25:42.800]  They play things like the Bloodhound Gang. They play stuff like Madonna. They really play a bunch
[25:42.800 --> 25:48.400]  of great 80s dance music that just keeps the pulse going and keeps the crowd moving. They played
[25:48.400 --> 25:55.680]  Like a Prayer by Madonna. Every female in the crowd, in the group, instantly turned into a
[25:55.680 --> 25:59.920]  teenage girl. It looked like they were all in their bathroom in front of the mirror using their
[25:59.920 --> 26:05.760]  brush as a microphone, just getting down. Just like a prayer. Every one of those girls knew
[26:06.320 --> 26:11.760]  every single word of that Madonna song. It was really fun to watch everybody just connect and
[26:11.760 --> 26:16.160]  have a good time. There were grown men, myself included, singing fucking Madonna songs.
[26:16.160 --> 26:21.280]  We danced in the parking lot at the ball pit car until about two o'clock every morning. Then when
[26:21.280 --> 26:26.320]  that party ended, we had to find somewhere else to go and boogie down. Eventually, the night ended.
[26:26.320 --> 26:31.920]  I ended up back at the hotel. Then I got to repeat the process Saturday and Sunday. I would get up,
[26:31.920 --> 26:36.480]  go find some delicious food, have a great lunch, then go hit the fish parking lot.
[26:36.480 --> 26:40.640]  I would get to the parking lot about three. We would hang out with a bunch of good friends,
[26:40.640 --> 26:47.280]  roam around, smoke, eat, be merry. Then around 6.30 or 7 every night, I would get my pockets
[26:47.280 --> 26:51.120]  together and I would head into the show, go find myself a drink, go find a snack,
[26:51.120 --> 26:56.480]  go chill out for a couple of minutes, rest my legs, go find a cool shade spot, get a seat.
[26:56.480 --> 27:00.800]  Then once the band came on, I would stand up and honestly just go find a cool dancing spot.
[27:00.800 --> 27:05.120]  That's when I would enjoy the show and say hi to all of my friends. That was my experience
[27:05.120 --> 27:10.720]  at Fish, at Dix, in Commerce City, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I got a little bit of sunburn.
[27:10.720 --> 27:14.640]  It was hot as shit. I got super dehydrated. You might be able to hear it in my voice. It's been
[27:14.640 --> 27:18.720]  a couple of days since then. I had to take a break before I could record, but my voice was
[27:18.720 --> 27:23.760]  shot. I sounded grovelly for a couple of days. It was well worth it singing along to my favorite
[27:23.760 --> 27:28.560]  Fish songs. That was my Fish weekend. I want to give a shout out to some of my friends.
[27:28.560 --> 27:34.240]  I am honestly going to miss people. I saw so many damn great people at this Fish show that I feel
[27:34.240 --> 27:38.480]  bad that I'm going to leave people out of this list, but I need to make sure to give some shout
[27:38.480 --> 27:43.200]  outs. I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy, Baker. Baker is a giant Fish fan. He is my
[27:43.200 --> 27:48.240]  buddy. That's my boy. I had a good time seeing Baker. The first thing I did when I drove to
[27:48.240 --> 27:52.880]  Denver was drove directly to Baker's house because that's my buddy. Had to go give him some love.
[27:52.880 --> 27:56.240]  What's up, Baker? Hope you're listening. Big shout out. So big shout out to my buddy, Baker.
[27:56.240 --> 28:01.280]  Also, I got to meet a friend who I've only been corresponding with online. It's always fun to
[28:01.280 --> 28:04.880]  meet up with people, actually see what these people look like, see what kind of people they
[28:04.880 --> 28:09.040]  are, shake their hands, smoke with them. I got to meet my friend, Ryan. He would rather stay
[28:09.040 --> 28:13.360]  mostly anonymous. We're just going to call him Ryan on here. Ryan, you grow dank weed, bro. You
[28:13.360 --> 28:18.080]  do a really good job. I look forward to having more conversations with you. Also, I want to give
[28:18.080 --> 28:22.880]  a huge shout out to my friends, Jaren and Sarah. Jaren from New Millennium Nutrients was hanging
[28:22.880 --> 28:27.840]  out at the Fish shows. I was randomly just walking. It was hot as fuck. I had been walking
[28:27.840 --> 28:31.760]  for a long time. I was just going to go find some shade and sit down in the shade. There was a nice
[28:31.760 --> 28:35.680]  grassy area. I was just going to go kick it and relax in the shade and play with my phone for a
[28:35.680 --> 28:39.920]  minute. I turned the corner and there was Jaren from New Millennium Nutrients just hanging out,
[28:39.920 --> 28:44.320]  him and his beautiful wife, Sarah. I'm 90% sure her name was Sarah. I'm bad with names.
[28:44.320 --> 28:48.000]  She was a really nice lady, really sweet. We had fun talking. I came around the corner and there
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.360]  he was. I was like, what's up, bro? I told him, hey, I don't want to interrupt. I see you're here
[28:51.360 --> 28:54.560]  with your wife. I feel like a third wheel. He's like, dude, hang out with us. Just sit down.
[28:54.560 --> 29:00.480]  So we hung out, smoked a bowl or two, allegedly, hung out, chatted about nutrients, chatted about
[29:00.480 --> 29:04.720]  fish, talked about the cannabis industry. I went for a little bit of a walk, spent a few minutes
[29:04.720 --> 29:08.480]  together, and then I parted ways with them so that I could let them do their couple thing.
[29:08.480 --> 29:12.720]  I didn't want to intrude too much. I feel just fine being by myself. I can go find more friends
[29:12.720 --> 29:16.720]  to hang out with or I can go hang out by myself. So I had some fun with Jaren and his beautiful
[29:16.720 --> 29:22.800]  wife for a little bit. Then I also got to see some of my wonderful friends. Big shout out to Erica
[29:22.800 --> 29:27.440]  and Patrick and their entire family. I got to meet their children this time. We've been friends for
[29:27.440 --> 29:32.000]  a little bit. I've only seen pictures and heard wonderful stories about their children. So it was
[29:32.000 --> 29:35.680]  great to finally meet those little kids. They actually brought me a cool gift. I got a little
[29:35.680 --> 29:40.080]  My Friend, My Friend bracelet from them because they know that My Friend is one of my favorite
[29:40.080 --> 29:47.920]  fish songs. Also, My Friend was the first song that fish played at my first fish show in 1995.
[29:47.920 --> 29:54.000]  Yes, I have seen a lot of fish shows. I've probably seen more fish shows than you have seen
[29:54.000 --> 29:59.760]  all of your concerts together. So big shout out to my friends, Erica and Patrick and their sweet
[29:59.760 --> 30:03.680]  family. Your children are adorable. Thanks for letting me boogie down with you guys. It was an
[30:03.680 --> 30:08.880]  honor to help out with the family when you had so many kids and only two of you. So a big shout
[30:08.880 --> 30:14.160]  out to all of them. Also, big shout out to my buddy, Andrew. Andrew and Luke bring the ball pit
[30:14.160 --> 30:19.760]  car. Without that ball pit car, the parking lot party would just not be the fucking same.
[30:20.800 --> 30:26.960]  Also, I met a lot of people that listen to the podcast and a lot of people that know and support
[30:26.960 --> 30:31.920]  Iry Genetics. I'm also Iry Genetics. I don't know if you follow along, know that I'm also Iry
[30:31.920 --> 30:36.240]  Genetics, the seed breeder, the seed company. A lot of people listen to the show. A lot of people
[30:36.240 --> 30:41.520]  support the seeds. Many of them reached out and said hello. I heard, hey, Ross, hey, Dredd, hey,
[30:41.520 --> 30:47.040]  Ross to Jeff, hey, RJ. So many times I had to stop and say hi. No, I didn't have to. I got to stop and
[30:47.040 --> 30:52.480]  say hi to so many people. I gave away so many seed packages. If somebody said hello and they mentioned
[30:52.480 --> 30:56.880]  that they grow weed and they had a flower room, I gave them seeds. So I look forward to seeing all
[30:56.880 --> 31:01.440]  those seeds grow in people's flower rooms. But it was a really good time to say hello to so many
[31:01.440 --> 31:06.640]  people. So if you stopped me and you said hello, you gave me a hug, you shook my hand, you passed
[31:06.640 --> 31:11.200]  me a joint, you passed me a bowl, big shout out. What's up? Thank you for saying hi to me at the
[31:11.200 --> 31:15.440]  Fish Show. I told so many people that I was going to give them a shout out that I honestly don't
[31:15.440 --> 31:20.800]  want to miss anybody, so I'm not going to try to say any names, but thank you. I felt like royalty
[31:20.800 --> 31:25.680]  at the fucking Fish Shows. I've been going to Fish Shows for so long that I know many, many people
[31:25.680 --> 31:31.360]  in the fish crowd. I've been in Colorado for a really long time, so I know many, many people in
[31:31.360 --> 31:35.840]  the Colorado crowd. I've been in the cannabis industry for quite a while, and I've been making
[31:35.840 --> 31:40.560]  a name for myself in the cannabis and podcast scene, so a lot of people knew who I was, and it
[31:40.560 --> 31:46.800]  felt amazing to be treated like a fucking celebrity at a Fish Concert. So big shout out to all of my
[31:46.800 --> 31:51.520]  friends who made the weekend amazing. Extra gigantic fucking shout out to Fish. They're
[31:51.520 --> 31:57.040]  never going to hear this, but goddamn, big shout out to the boys in Fish. They made an amazing
[31:57.040 --> 32:03.040]  weekend. I really cannot wait for next year. I've said this before. If you guys go to a concert or
[32:03.040 --> 32:09.120]  a show and you see me, don't be shy. Come say hello. Yeah, I'm six foot five. I've got dreadlocks
[32:09.120 --> 32:13.680]  down to my knees. I might not look like the friendliest person, but to tell you the truth,
[32:13.680 --> 32:18.400]  I love meeting new people. I want to shake your hand. I want you to say hi. I want you to come
[32:18.400 --> 32:23.040]  tell me that you listen to the show. I want to know about your grow. Maybe I've got some seeds
[32:23.040 --> 32:27.920]  in my pocket, and I might give you a free five pack of something new. So come say hello. Don't
[32:27.920 --> 32:32.800]  be shy. I want to be your friend. I really don't like hearing about it the day after the concert.
[32:32.800 --> 32:36.960]  Hey, bro, I saw you at the Fish Concert. Didn't bother to say hi. Just going to tweet you about
[32:36.960 --> 32:41.520]  it. What the fuck kind of shit is that? Come say hello, dude. I do appreciate all of the internet
[32:41.520 --> 32:45.680]  stuff, but come shake my hand. Let's be friends. Let's make some eye contact. Let's connect.
[32:46.320 --> 32:50.400]  All right, podcast. Well, I feel like that was a great review of some of the fun that I get to
[32:50.400 --> 32:54.560]  have. I know I didn't talk a lot about cannabis on this podcast. This is a Thursday show. I've
[32:54.560 --> 32:58.080]  been a little bit busy, a little bit overwhelmed. I've been having a great time. Just wanted to
[32:58.080 --> 33:02.240]  share with you what I'm doing, let you be involved in my life. I think that helps us be friends,
[33:02.240 --> 33:06.480]  helps us connect a little bit better. So thank you for listening to this rambly podcast about
[33:06.480 --> 33:11.440]  some insights into my life. I do appreciate it. I would also appreciate it if you find me

[36:16.780 --> 36:21.340]  Love, I'm standing out, ain't got nowhere to go.
[36:25.420 --> 36:30.940]  Lord, I'm standing out, I ain't got nowhere to go.
[37:17.920 --> 37:23.820]  What's good?
[37:54.720 --> 37:57.040]  And I ain't got no where
[37:57.040 --> 37:58.080]  to go.
