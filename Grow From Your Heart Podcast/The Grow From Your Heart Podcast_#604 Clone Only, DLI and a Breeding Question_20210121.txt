[00:00.000 --> 00:03.360]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:03.360 --> 00:08.320]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 604 of the Grow From Your
[00:08.320 --> 00:09.320]  Heart Podcast.
[00:09.320 --> 00:12.680]  In this episode, I'm going to read a few Patreon messages.
[00:12.680 --> 00:16.720]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout-outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:16.720 --> 00:21.400]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[00:21.400 --> 00:22.640]  level or higher.
[00:22.640 --> 00:26.080]  So with no further ado, let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you
[00:26.080 --> 00:29.520]  shout-out to our friend 13Spark13.
[00:29.600 --> 00:31.800]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to DabSquatch.
[00:31.800 --> 00:34.140]  I want to send a big thank you shout-out to Zoso Jay.
[00:34.140 --> 00:36.360]  I want to send a special thank you to Noah N.

[00:41.120 --> 00:44.440]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout-out and a fist bump to my
[00:44.440 --> 00:45.660]  buddy the Turp Burgler.
[00:45.660 --> 00:48.160]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Mike Multi.

[00:53.760 --> 00:59.160]  I want to send a big high-five and a fist bump to MrMeanGreen8.
[00:59.160 --> 01:03.200]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you
[01:03.200 --> 01:06.700]  shout out to our friend Danky Dave.
[01:06.700 --> 01:10.460]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[01:10.460 --> 01:13.620]  If you're not already supporting the show and you'd like to learn how to do so, all
[01:13.620 --> 01:20.260]  you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart, all of the information
[01:20.260 --> 01:23.020]  you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[01:23.020 --> 01:26.860]  Of course, I did include that link in the show notes and in the video description, because
[01:26.860 --> 01:30.620]  I know a lot of you are listening while you're driving to work, maybe you're working, don't
[01:30.620 --> 01:33.180]  get yourself in a car crash, don't get yourself fired.
[01:33.180 --> 01:39.280]  You can support the show later at www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:39.280 --> 01:43.680]  While I'm talking about Patreon, let me talk about something I posted to Patreon.
[01:43.680 --> 01:47.500]  It has been brought to my attention that sometimes when I do shout outs, I'm not shouting out
[01:47.500 --> 01:49.060]  the name you would prefer.
[01:49.060 --> 01:53.380]  Sometimes I'm doing the wrong name, because that is what you signed up for on Patreon.
[01:53.380 --> 01:56.880]  If you would like me to give you a shout out at a different name, all you have to do
[01:56.880 --> 02:01.140]  is send me a Patreon message or an email and just say, Hey, Rasta Jeff, I signed up on
[02:01.140 --> 02:02.140]  Patreon.
[02:02.140 --> 02:04.560]  I'm using 13 spark 13 on Patreon.
[02:04.560 --> 02:08.900]  I would prefer that you call me this and I will make sure to use your preferred name
[02:08.900 --> 02:10.700]  for shout outs on the podcast.
[02:10.700 --> 02:15.540]  Honestly, one person has already corrected me and hey, bro, I lost the note.
[02:15.540 --> 02:16.860]  I don't know where I put that note.
[02:16.860 --> 02:20.140]  So you're going to have to send that to me again and let me know what you'd like me to
[02:20.140 --> 02:22.340]  call you for the shout outs on the show.
[02:22.340 --> 02:27.140]  So just send me a message on Patreon or send me an email at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:27.140 --> 02:31.180]  I will make sure to make a spreadsheet, make some sort of notes that say this person wants
[02:31.180 --> 02:34.980]  to be called this and I'll do my best to remember when I give you shout outs on the show.
[02:34.980 --> 02:38.440]  I try to respect people's privacy and also give you the shout outs you asked for.
[02:38.440 --> 02:40.100]  So thank you for the support.
[02:40.100 --> 02:41.100]  Help me.
[02:41.100 --> 02:42.100]  I'll help you out.
[02:42.100 --> 02:43.100]  All right.
[02:43.100 --> 02:44.300]  I said I was going to read a few Patreon messages.
[02:44.300 --> 02:45.820]  Let's not waste too much time.
[02:45.820 --> 02:49.780]  Let's jump right into the Patreon messages for this show.
[02:49.780 --> 02:52.940]  The first one comes from, do they want their name said?
[02:52.940 --> 02:56.020]  They didn't sign it with their full name, so we're not going to read their name.
[02:56.020 --> 02:57.020]  This one goes like this.
[02:57.020 --> 02:59.620]  It says, hey Rasta Jeff, I hope you're doing well, brother.
[02:59.620 --> 03:01.460]  I'm a huge fan of the podcast.
[03:01.460 --> 03:03.500]  I am great and thank you for listening.
[03:03.500 --> 03:07.060]  It goes on to say, I was wondering about Durban poison seeds.
[03:07.060 --> 03:11.660]  I was always told it was a plant only, but I'm seeing seeds for sale online.
[03:11.660 --> 03:15.260]  Could imposter seeds be a real thing?
[03:15.260 --> 03:20.140]  So he said plant only, but the actual phrase that we will use in the industry or in the
[03:20.140 --> 03:23.980]  cannabis scene in the community would be clone only.
[03:23.980 --> 03:26.820]  Durban poison was what was known as a clone only.
[03:26.820 --> 03:29.740]  There are plenty of plants out there that are clone only.
[03:29.740 --> 03:31.940]  And I talk about clone only plants all the time.
[03:31.940 --> 03:36.820]  Let me tell you what clone only plant means in my definition in our scene.
[03:36.820 --> 03:41.260]  So something that say I breed a plant, let's just say that I took, I want to talk about
[03:41.260 --> 03:43.540]  something I've never released and never put out that way.
[03:43.540 --> 03:45.140]  It's actually clone only.
[03:45.220 --> 03:49.460]  Let's say I took a golden goat female and reversed it, made a male out of the golden
[03:49.460 --> 03:50.460]  goat.
[03:50.460 --> 03:51.860]  Then I pollinate the LA Kush.
[03:51.860 --> 03:54.940]  I've got golden goat or LA Kush to golden goat at this point.
[03:54.940 --> 03:56.100]  It's a fem seed.
[03:56.100 --> 03:58.220]  I find a plant that I really, really love.
[03:58.220 --> 04:00.060]  I keep that one plant.
[04:00.060 --> 04:04.220]  Then I don't grow any more of the seeds or I toss all of the other plants that I grew.
[04:04.220 --> 04:09.140]  That one LA Kush to golden goat is now clone only because it's the only one.
[04:09.140 --> 04:14.060]  If I don't release any seeds of it, if I don't have a male of that plant, the only way that
[04:14.060 --> 04:17.460]  that plant is available is through clone only.
[04:17.460 --> 04:22.100]  So that becomes what's known as a clone only strains like girl scout cookies.
[04:22.100 --> 04:25.900]  That is a clone only the forum cut, the thin mint cut, whatever you want to call them.
[04:25.900 --> 04:28.860]  That is a clone only gorilla glue.
[04:28.860 --> 04:30.940]  Number four is a clone only.
[04:30.940 --> 04:33.300]  That's why it's got the number four at the end of it.
[04:33.300 --> 04:36.220]  Josie Wells had a few gorilla glue phenotypes.
[04:36.220 --> 04:37.860]  He selected the number four.
[04:37.860 --> 04:41.100]  There weren't any more seeds after that, so there could be no more breeding to make more
[04:41.100 --> 04:42.300]  of those plants.
[04:42.300 --> 04:43.300]  There was number four.
[04:43.540 --> 04:44.540]  There was number seven.
[04:44.540 --> 04:46.140]  I believe there was another number that was a keeper.
[04:46.140 --> 04:48.020]  They chose to go with the number four.
[04:48.020 --> 04:50.000]  So gorilla glue number four got spread out.
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.440]  That was a clone only.
[04:51.440 --> 04:53.900]  There was no male of the gorilla glue to breed with.
[04:53.900 --> 04:54.900]  You don't have a male.
[04:54.900 --> 04:58.700]  How are you going to make seeds of that that are not a gorilla glue out cross or something
[04:58.700 --> 05:02.580]  other than something I'll talk about in a moment, but a clone only is something that
[05:02.580 --> 05:05.260]  a breeder made and never released seeds of it.
[05:05.260 --> 05:06.420]  He only released.
[05:06.420 --> 05:10.820]  She may have also only released a clone of that plant, so it is a clone only.
[05:10.820 --> 05:12.620]  There are no seeds put out there.
[05:12.620 --> 05:16.780]  Now we're going to talk about things that make it possible for you to have that in a
[05:16.780 --> 05:17.980]  seed form.
[05:17.980 --> 05:20.420]  I make feminized seeds.
[05:20.420 --> 05:26.180]  Golden goat is a clone only until I came around and made feminized seeds of the golden goat.
[05:26.180 --> 05:31.420]  That's really easy to make unadulterated golden goat feminized seeds that are not imposter
[05:31.420 --> 05:32.420]  seeds.
[05:32.420 --> 05:35.900]  What I did, I took the original golden goat clone only popular clone.
[05:35.900 --> 05:39.580]  I treat it with a solution, which I talked about in a very recent episode.
[05:39.580 --> 05:44.060]  I treat it with silver thiosulfate a number of times on a schedule and a specific ratio
[05:44.060 --> 05:47.140]  and dilution that creates feminized pollen.
[05:47.140 --> 05:52.060]  I then put that feminized pollen on another clone of the golden goat, and I'm not adulterating
[05:52.060 --> 05:53.060]  the genetics.
[05:53.060 --> 05:54.580]  It is golden goat to golden goat.
[05:54.580 --> 05:57.940]  The seeds that come out are unadulterated golden goat as swans.
[05:57.940 --> 05:59.580]  I have selfed that golden goat.
[05:59.580 --> 06:02.260]  I've made feminized seeds.
[06:02.260 --> 06:08.940]  So it is possible to make feminized seeds of a clone only strain that is possible and
[06:08.940 --> 06:12.620]  very likely, especially with something like Durban poison.
[06:12.620 --> 06:15.220]  I'm not sure how much Durban poison was clone only.
[06:15.220 --> 06:17.300]  That's kind of a, an African land race.
[06:17.300 --> 06:19.780]  It's got a lot of rumors and myths and legends around it.
[06:19.780 --> 06:21.420]  I'm sure there are a lot of seeds of that available.
[06:21.420 --> 06:24.740]  If you're privy to where to look for those sorts of things, if you know who to ask, especially
[06:24.740 --> 06:30.020]  if you're from the Durban area, I'm sure those seeds are abundant.
[06:30.020 --> 06:32.180]  So they could be imposters, but it is impossible.
[06:32.180 --> 06:37.500]  It is possible that they are feminized seeds and they are true Durban poison.
[06:37.660 --> 06:40.340]  Also it is likely that they are real Durban poison seeds.
[06:40.340 --> 06:45.020]  I think Ed Rosenthal was putting out Durban poison seeds through Sensi seed company several
[06:45.020 --> 06:46.020]  years ago.
[06:46.020 --> 06:49.980]  Ed might not have been involved in that, but I do remember Ed and Sensi seed company or
[06:49.980 --> 06:53.360]  somebody putting out the Durban poison seeds a long time ago.
[06:53.360 --> 06:55.140]  My memory's a little foggy on some things.
[06:55.140 --> 06:57.080]  There's a lot going on in there.
[06:57.080 --> 06:59.740]  So it could be real Durban poison seeds.
[06:59.740 --> 07:05.420]  They could be feminized seeds or another option is it could be a back cross.
[07:05.500 --> 07:07.460]  Let me talk about back cross for a moment.
[07:07.460 --> 07:10.060]  I made golden goat feminized seeds.
[07:10.060 --> 07:13.120]  Many people are not fond of running feminized seeds.
[07:13.120 --> 07:16.860]  They think that they are going to be problematic or they are just more into the natural male
[07:16.860 --> 07:18.520]  female seeds.
[07:18.520 --> 07:21.820]  Those people also wanted golden goat seeds in their garden.
[07:21.820 --> 07:27.300]  So the best thing for me to do was to make golden goat BX, a back cross.
[07:27.300 --> 07:32.340]  That is attempting to make a replica of the original golden goat, but I've got to adulterate
[07:32.340 --> 07:35.340]  it by introducing a male into the equation.
[07:35.380 --> 07:41.740]  So I took a male plant that was vastly different in every way from the original golden goat
[07:41.740 --> 07:47.260]  and I pollinated that male plant with, I pollinated the golden goat with that male plant.
[07:47.260 --> 07:50.860]  Now I've got something that is basically, if you're going to think in colors, one was
[07:50.860 --> 07:52.600]  red and one was blue.
[07:52.600 --> 07:56.540]  So when we cross them, when I'm looking for the red phenotype that represents the golden
[07:56.540 --> 08:00.940]  goat, it was going to be very easy for me to identify their traits were so different.
[08:00.940 --> 08:03.100]  They were red and blue, they were black and white.
[08:03.100 --> 08:07.420]  It was very easy for me to tell the difference in the progeny when I grew them out.
[08:07.420 --> 08:12.380]  So I grew out the plants that came from that cross that it was a daybreaker male is what
[08:12.380 --> 08:15.340]  I used and it's a different daybreaker.
[08:15.340 --> 08:17.460]  We're going to avoid that whole rabbit hole there.
[08:17.460 --> 08:18.460]  That's a daybreaker male.
[08:18.460 --> 08:24.040]  I use the daybreaker to pollinate the golden goat that made the first round of seeds.
[08:24.040 --> 08:27.820]  Those seeds then made, I found a male in that batch of seeds.
[08:27.820 --> 08:28.820]  I do know what I'm saying.
[08:28.820 --> 08:29.820]  I got lost for a second.
[08:29.820 --> 08:34.700]  I found a male in that batch of seeds that looked identical to the female golden goat
[08:34.700 --> 08:35.860]  I've already got.
[08:35.860 --> 08:39.360]  So daybreaker male pollinated the golden goat female.
[08:39.360 --> 08:40.360]  Seeds came out of that.
[08:40.360 --> 08:45.860]  I used those seeds to search for a male that looked exactly like the original golden goat.
[08:45.860 --> 08:47.960]  It grew the same height, the same width.
[08:47.960 --> 08:50.000]  It had the same branching structure.
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.500]  The leaves were exactly the same size and shape.
[08:53.500 --> 08:56.300]  The serrations on the leaves were exactly the same.
[08:56.300 --> 08:59.060]  It reacted the same way to Calamag deficiencies.
[08:59.060 --> 09:01.900]  It reacted the same way to being topped and manipulated.
[09:01.900 --> 09:06.820]  So this plant was basically a mirror of the female golden goat, but it was a boy.
[09:06.820 --> 09:11.100]  So at that point I took that boy and pollinated the original golden goat.
[09:11.100 --> 09:15.700]  My intention now is that these boy genetics and these female genetics are so strongly
[09:15.700 --> 09:21.220]  golden goat that what I create is going to be a large percent golden goat, very dominant,
[09:21.220 --> 09:23.900]  very, it's like a replica of the original golden goat.
[09:23.900 --> 09:28.680]  And I was successful because the way that I went about that first crossing was by making
[09:28.680 --> 09:30.520]  a very obvious out cross.
[09:30.520 --> 09:32.680]  So I would know what I was looking for in the males.
[09:32.680 --> 09:33.840]  So that is a back cross.
[09:33.840 --> 09:38.700]  You take a male, you adulterate the original cross, then you find a male from that progeny
[09:38.700 --> 09:44.400]  and pollinate the female, the original female in an attempt to recreate the original cross.
[09:44.400 --> 09:47.040]  And that's what I've done with the golden goat back cross one.
[09:47.040 --> 09:52.000]  My next method would be to run those seeds again and find another from that BX one, run
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.180]  those seeds and find a male that again represents that golden goat female and pollinate one
[09:56.180 --> 09:57.180]  more time.
[09:57.180 --> 10:01.020]  And that would increase the likelihood of getting that perfect golden goat phenotype
[10:01.020 --> 10:02.680]  out of a pack of seeds.
[10:02.680 --> 10:07.600]  So it is very likely that those Durban poison seeds are real.
[10:07.600 --> 10:09.260]  I would check with the breeder.
[10:09.260 --> 10:12.660]  Hopefully that's a reputable breeder that you are working with, but the Durban poison
[10:12.660 --> 10:17.140]  has been around in a commercial environments in the underground cultivation scene and the
[10:17.140 --> 10:19.600]  gray market and the free market for quite a while.
[10:19.600 --> 10:23.680]  So it is quite possible that that one is out there and available.
[10:23.680 --> 10:27.820]  But if you see people trying to sell you something like golden goat, number four, regular
[10:27.820 --> 10:29.600]  seeds, that's when you need to question things.
[10:29.600 --> 10:34.040]  When you see them selling girl scout cookies, regular seeds, that's when you question things.
[10:34.040 --> 10:35.780]  Those are clone only plants.
[10:35.780 --> 10:39.920]  And again, a clone only is something the breeder only put that clone out of.
[10:39.920 --> 10:41.880]  We never put out any other seeds.
[10:41.880 --> 10:43.160]  We never put out a male.
[10:43.160 --> 10:44.440]  You can't reproduce it.
[10:44.440 --> 10:47.800]  It is clone only, not available in seed form.
[10:47.800 --> 10:50.000]  All right, let me keep myself moving.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.160]  I feel like I've got a good flow going.
[10:52.160 --> 10:55.520]  This next question comes from, it says, use the name Baz.
[10:55.520 --> 10:56.520]  What up, Baz?
[10:56.520 --> 10:57.960]  Thank you for the great message.
[10:57.960 --> 11:01.960]  It says, oh, they've got a, this one came from the website where we've got a grow help
[11:01.960 --> 11:02.960]  tab.
[11:02.960 --> 11:03.960]  Let me tell you about the grow help tab.
[11:03.960 --> 11:08.080]  If you go to iRegenetics.com, there's a tab that says grow help.
[11:08.080 --> 11:12.000]  Click on that tab, fill out a few short questions, tell me what's wrong with the plants and I
[11:12.000 --> 11:13.760]  will do my best to help you out.
[11:13.760 --> 11:16.880]  Here is one of those questions from the grow help tab.
[11:16.880 --> 11:19.920]  Our friend Baz is growing a strain called crystal candy.
[11:19.920 --> 11:22.000]  They're growing it indoors under LED lights.
[11:22.840 --> 11:23.840]  They're in veg.
[11:23.840 --> 11:24.840]  They're growing in soil.
[11:24.840 --> 11:26.280]  They've got a lot of details here.
[11:26.280 --> 11:27.280]  I've read the question.
[11:27.280 --> 11:31.600]  Those details are not going to matter because I already know the answer to your question.
[11:31.600 --> 11:33.200]  The problem.
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.520]  It says the leaves are drooping the last few hours of the light cycle.
[11:37.520 --> 11:41.520]  When the lights come back on, the plants seem fine.
[11:41.520 --> 11:44.560]  This is a thing known as the daily light integral.
[11:44.560 --> 11:47.400]  Those plants know that the light is going to go off in a little bit.
[11:47.400 --> 11:48.660]  They're kind of programmed.
[11:48.660 --> 11:52.260]  They know the light comes on at this time and the light goes off at that time.
[11:52.260 --> 11:55.900]  They're starting to say, hey, bro, hey, sis, it's probably bedtime.
[11:55.900 --> 11:56.940]  We should start calming down.
[11:56.940 --> 12:00.580]  We should get some tea, start reading a book and settle down for the night, start finding
[12:00.580 --> 12:02.300]  a blanket and a pillow and start chilling out.
[12:02.300 --> 12:06.260]  They know that the daily light integral, they've got, first of all, they know the light is
[12:06.260 --> 12:07.260]  going to go off.
[12:07.260 --> 12:09.060]  The next thing is they've gotten enough light.
[12:09.060 --> 12:11.540]  They're saying, hey, that's all the light I'm going to take for today.
[12:11.540 --> 12:12.660]  I don't need more photons.
[12:12.660 --> 12:14.460]  I can't photosynthesize anymore.
[12:14.460 --> 12:15.740]  I've taken what I can get.
[12:15.740 --> 12:19.220]  Your plants are getting enough light and they also know that sleepy time is coming
[12:19.220 --> 12:20.820]  up so they're just chilling out.
[12:20.820 --> 12:21.820]  They're just getting lazy.
[12:21.820 --> 12:23.100]  They're taking a little bit of a break.
[12:23.100 --> 12:25.100]  It is nothing to be alarmed about.
[12:25.100 --> 12:28.180]  The reason that it looks good right when they wake up is because now they're awake.
[12:28.180 --> 12:30.000]  They're ready to start working again.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.740]  You may be able to dial back a little bit of light.
[12:32.740 --> 12:36.300]  You may be able to reduce the amount of PPFD that these plants are getting.
[12:36.300 --> 12:39.780]  If your plants, if your lights are dimmable, you may be able to dim it just a little bit,
[12:39.780 --> 12:44.740]  maybe raise it just a little bit or maybe reduce the amount of light hours you were
[12:44.740 --> 12:45.740]  giving these plants.
[12:45.740 --> 12:49.660]  I know you don't want them to go into flower too early, but that may help you out because
[12:49.660 --> 12:50.980]  they are getting enough light.
[12:50.980 --> 12:54.220]  You don't want to waste electricity if they're already telling you, hey bro, I'm ready to
[12:54.220 --> 12:55.220]  go to bed.
[12:55.220 --> 12:59.420]  If it's like a solid hour before you turn off those lights, you may be able to adjust.
[12:59.420 --> 13:02.780]  If it's like 30 minutes, then I may just leave it the way it is because they're saying, hey,
[13:02.780 --> 13:04.020]  I know it's nighttime.
[13:04.020 --> 13:05.780]  We're going to go to sleepy time now.
[13:05.780 --> 13:06.780]  Nothing to worry about.
[13:06.780 --> 13:07.780]  It's a kind of a good sign.
[13:07.780 --> 13:10.820]  It says you've got a healthy garden going on and they're on a good schedule and they
[13:10.820 --> 13:12.180]  know what to do for you.
[13:12.180 --> 13:14.300]  So thank you for the great question, my friend Baz.
[13:14.300 --> 13:15.680]  Hope I helped you out.
[13:15.680 --> 13:16.680]  Don't freak out.
[13:16.680 --> 13:17.680]  Don't change anything.
[13:17.680 --> 13:21.140]  Maybe just adjust a little bit of lighting so you don't waste any electricity.
[13:21.140 --> 13:22.520]  All right.
[13:22.520 --> 13:26.780]  This one comes from our friend Alabama man, and this one was from Patreon.
[13:26.780 --> 13:28.940]  It is a two part question.
[13:28.940 --> 13:33.700]  The first one says, Mr. Rasta Jeff, most of your strains share the word tall in their
[13:33.700 --> 13:35.060]  description.
[13:35.060 --> 13:38.700]  Starting with your shortest variety, can you please name the five shortest plants in your
[13:38.700 --> 13:39.700]  lineup?
[13:40.100 --> 13:45.860]  That is a really great question.
[13:45.860 --> 13:51.060]  And I replied with, unfortunately, most of what I breed is like a sativa dominant, kind
[13:51.060 --> 13:56.780]  of a skinny leaf, a thin leaf, kind of a hybrid of mostly sativa dominant genetics.
[13:56.780 --> 13:59.480]  And most of them are going to get quite tall on you.
[13:59.480 --> 14:04.180]  For shorter plants, I would probably recommend prana, morning dew.
[14:04.180 --> 14:07.620]  And then I may say something like, what was the other one I recommended?
[14:07.620 --> 14:09.120]  Prana and morning dew.
[14:09.540 --> 14:13.200]  And sometimes the orange chasm will stay short if you don't veg for too long.
[14:13.200 --> 14:16.540]  But that's, oh, sun kiss is the other one I would recommend also.
[14:16.540 --> 14:19.800]  Those are what I've got for shorter, although they are going to get tall.
[14:19.800 --> 14:23.900]  If you want to prevent too tall of a plant, that's when you've got to work on canopy control.
[14:23.900 --> 14:26.520]  You can keep anything short if you scrog it down.
[14:26.520 --> 14:30.760]  Learn how to work a scrog canopy, maybe a two or three layer scrog.
[14:30.760 --> 14:33.740]  The first one is to spread them out instead of getting them growing up tall.
[14:33.740 --> 14:36.320]  You just put that scrog down and make them go straight out.
[14:36.320 --> 14:37.960]  Then you let them grow up a little bit into that.
[14:37.960 --> 14:40.080]  That second one is to kind of support the buds.
[14:40.080 --> 14:43.400]  And then the third one is to really give you some support for tall colas.
[14:43.400 --> 14:47.680]  But you can run anything if you scrog it down, learn to work it, manipulate it, bend it over.
[14:47.680 --> 14:49.600]  You can figure that part out.
[14:49.600 --> 14:50.840]  Arthritis.
[14:50.840 --> 14:54.640]  I think the Arise is great for arthritis, although it's going to get kind of tall on you.
[14:54.640 --> 14:56.540]  I would say maybe try morning dew.
[14:56.540 --> 15:00.680]  That is going to be a great all around Indica Sativa hybrid that will give you some nice
[15:00.680 --> 15:01.680]  pain relief.
[15:01.680 --> 15:03.000]  It shouldn't get too tall on you.
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.000]  All right.
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.960]  There is a second part of le question.
[15:05.960 --> 15:11.360]  It says, Mr. Jeff, would there be any benefit realized if a grower saved the pollen from
[15:11.360 --> 15:16.520]  a male plant of a regular pack of iris seeds and then use that pollen on selected buds
[15:16.520 --> 15:18.560]  of a female plant?
[15:18.560 --> 15:24.380]  I get free seeds for my trouble, but would those seeds be stable mirrors of each plant?
[15:24.380 --> 15:26.040]  This is a great question.
[15:26.040 --> 15:31.520]  So they are asking if they took pollen from a male plant from a regular pack of seeds.
[15:31.520 --> 15:33.200]  So you got a regular pack of seeds.
[15:33.200 --> 15:35.160]  You find a boy, you collect the pollen.
[15:35.160 --> 15:37.800]  You are on the path to breeding already.
[15:37.800 --> 15:41.480]  Later use that pollen on select buds of a different female plant.
[15:41.480 --> 15:42.480]  That is what you do.
[15:42.480 --> 15:44.540]  That is how we start making new crosses.
[15:44.540 --> 15:48.040]  You may make gold or you may make something that isn't gold.
[15:48.040 --> 15:51.880]  You may make something that is mediocre and okay, or you may make a bunch of hemp seeds
[15:51.880 --> 15:54.320]  that you end up wanting to throw away.
[15:54.320 --> 15:55.520]  Likelihood of that happening.
[15:55.520 --> 15:59.720]  If you're using Irie crosses, you're very likely going to have good success because
[15:59.720 --> 16:01.560]  I've done good work before you.
[16:01.560 --> 16:05.120]  I've set you up for success by selecting good breeding plants.
[16:05.120 --> 16:06.840]  I bred with them, sent them along to you.
[16:06.840 --> 16:08.480]  They are good breeding stock.
[16:08.480 --> 16:11.960]  So yes, basically you would get good free seeds.
[16:11.960 --> 16:17.140]  Now the question here is, would those seeds be stable mirrors of each parent?
[16:17.140 --> 16:21.160]  That kind of depends on the breeding stock, which you start with.
[16:21.160 --> 16:26.800]  If you start with pure Irie genetics, you may breed yourself into what we call a bottleneck.
[16:26.800 --> 16:29.400]  Most of what I breed has got a rise in it.
[16:29.400 --> 16:31.380]  It's got that King Solomon in there.
[16:32.200 --> 16:38.020]  So if you bred the Arise to Strawberry Starburst, you're going to get a lot of Arise dominant stuff.
[16:38.020 --> 16:42.420]  If you breed Strawberry Starburst and Blue Raspberry Truffle, there are two Arise parents
[16:42.420 --> 16:43.420]  in there.
[16:43.420 --> 16:45.480]  You're going to get some Arise dominant traits.
[16:45.480 --> 16:49.900]  But if you take that, the male and put it on something that doesn't have the same parent
[16:49.900 --> 16:53.940]  in there, yes, you are opening up a lot of options for great breeding.
[16:53.940 --> 16:57.080]  Now are you going to get mirrors of the parents?
[16:57.080 --> 17:01.100]  You will find some phenotypes that look just like the mommy plant.
[17:01.100 --> 17:04.220]  You'll find some phenotypes that look just like the daddy plant.
[17:04.220 --> 17:09.140]  Then you will find some phenotypes that are the perfect 50-50 mix of both of those plants.
[17:09.140 --> 17:12.740]  Then you're going to find everything in the middle of those also.
[17:12.740 --> 17:16.180]  Depending on how large of a population of seeds you can run, that's when you're going
[17:16.180 --> 17:18.160]  to start seeing the variation.
[17:18.160 --> 17:21.900]  You can make quite a few seeds in very small plants.
[17:21.900 --> 17:26.020]  Just by pollinating one branch or growing just little tiny plants and pollinating them,
[17:26.020 --> 17:29.020]  you can make plenty of seeds for yourself to experiment with.
[17:29.500 --> 17:31.300]  Stable mirrors of each parent.
[17:31.300 --> 17:35.120]  You're going to see phenotypes like the mom, phenotypes like the dad.
[17:35.120 --> 17:37.140]  You're going to see 50-50 mixes.
[17:37.140 --> 17:38.840]  Then you're going to see everything in between.
[17:38.840 --> 17:41.180]  Something that's a little more mommy but looks like daddy.
[17:41.180 --> 17:43.500]  Something's a little bit more daddy that looks like mommy.
[17:43.500 --> 17:47.340]  It depends on which traits in those plants are dominant and recessive and which pop up
[17:47.340 --> 17:48.340]  more often.
[17:48.340 --> 17:54.100]  Now what you're also going to see is representations of the grandparents.
[17:54.100 --> 17:56.480]  The mom plant also has a mom and dad.
[17:56.480 --> 17:58.480]  The dad plant also has a mom and dad.
[17:58.480 --> 18:01.360]  You're going to see varieties of those popping up.
[18:01.360 --> 18:03.480]  If you know what the grandparents are, it's more obvious.
[18:03.480 --> 18:04.640]  You know what to look for.
[18:04.640 --> 18:07.520]  I see those things because I've got the whole family tree going.
[18:07.520 --> 18:08.520]  I've created them.
[18:08.520 --> 18:09.520]  I've bred them.
[18:09.520 --> 18:12.880]  I've worked with them for so long that I can identify grandparents and great-grandparents
[18:12.880 --> 18:14.520]  and their progeny.
[18:14.520 --> 18:21.000]  You will see, yes, stable mirrors of each parent, but you're going to see random representations
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.500]  of grandparents and everything in between.
[18:23.500 --> 18:25.640]  It's all about which plants you select.
[18:25.640 --> 18:31.960]  Some things give you wild phenotype variation and some are very uniform from the first cross.
[18:31.960 --> 18:36.520]  If you get wild variation, pick your favorite female and your favorite male out of the population
[18:36.520 --> 18:40.440]  and breed them and then do it again and do it again and you'll narrow down to the traits
[18:40.440 --> 18:43.160]  that you're looking for.
[18:43.160 --> 18:48.560]  You may find stable mirrors of each parent, but you're also going to find outliers.
[18:48.560 --> 18:51.600]  You're going to find things that look like mommy, things that look like daddy, like I
[18:51.600 --> 18:57.120]  keep saying that, 50-50, and then grandparents, and then maybe, just maybe, you will find
[18:57.120 --> 19:00.080]  some grandparents there in that mix.
[19:00.080 --> 19:04.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers,
[19:04.240 --> 19:08.160]  growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all you beautiful people out there in cannabis
[19:08.160 --> 19:11.360]  world, I want to thank you again for listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[19:11.360 --> 19:12.360]  podcast.
[19:12.360 --> 19:14.680]  I feel like this episode went by quite quickly.
[19:14.680 --> 19:16.120]  I answered three messages.
[19:16.120 --> 19:17.720]  Maybe I should have tried to do four.
[19:17.720 --> 19:20.120]  No need to ramble and make extra time out of a podcast.
[19:20.120 --> 19:22.360]  It's all about quality over quantity.
[19:22.360 --> 19:24.680]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[19:24.680 --> 19:26.160]  I'll try to make that one longer.
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.200]  I just wrote down three messages and went through them quickly.

[20:43.360 --> 20:45.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is all I've got for you for this episode.
[20:45.840 --> 20:48.120]  You know I'll be back in just a couple of days with fresh new content.
[20:48.120 --> 20:51.560]  I want to give a shout out to my friend known as F1 Pete.
