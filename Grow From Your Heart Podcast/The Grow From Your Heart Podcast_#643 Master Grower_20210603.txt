[00:13.540 --> 00:20.100]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff and this is episode 643 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:20.100 --> 00:22.620]  I've got a great Thursday show lined up for you.
[00:22.620 --> 00:26.700]  Before we get to the main topics, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710
[00:26.700 --> 00:27.700]  club.

[00:59.080 --> 01:00.280]  Shout out to don't tread on me for 20.
[01:00.280 --> 01:03.440]  Then let's wrap it up with the big grow from your heart podcast.
[01:03.440 --> 01:04.440]  Thank you.
[01:04.440 --> 01:06.800]  Shout out to my friend guy UD grows.

[01:37.400 --> 01:41.400]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:41.400 --> 01:42.400]  All right.
[01:42.400 --> 01:44.640]  I don't want to waste a lot of time at the start of the show.
[01:44.640 --> 01:47.320]  I've got a bunch of small topics I want to cover.
[01:47.320 --> 01:50.520]  Not one big topic I'm going to delve really deeply into today.
[01:50.520 --> 01:52.360]  We're going to cover a bunch of topics.
[01:52.360 --> 01:56.320]  I've written a bunch of notes as time goes on and I've got a little like a PDF file or
[01:56.320 --> 01:59.040]  a Google document of things I want to talk about on the show.
[01:59.040 --> 02:00.280]  I try to make a show out of that.
[02:00.280 --> 02:04.200]  These are a few things that didn't qualify for a full show, but should be mentioned on
[02:04.200 --> 02:05.200]  a show.
[02:05.200 --> 02:09.400]  So here are a few of these small notes compiled into a Thursday episode.
[02:09.400 --> 02:12.480]  Without too much more rambling, let's talk about one of the first ones on the list.
[02:12.480 --> 02:15.520]  It says quarantine incoming clones.
[02:15.520 --> 02:16.520]  That's right.
[02:16.520 --> 02:17.640]  We've talked about clones on a previous episode.
[02:17.640 --> 02:19.880]  I've talked about sharing clones with your friends.
[02:19.880 --> 02:24.280]  It's never a bad idea to get clones from friends or get maybe even get them from a dispensary.
[02:24.280 --> 02:26.680]  However you get them, it's always fun to get new genetics.
[02:26.680 --> 02:28.720]  But if you do that, it is very important.
[02:28.720 --> 02:32.040]  It is very critical that we quarantine these clones.
[02:32.040 --> 02:33.840]  They're coming into our garden.
[02:33.840 --> 02:35.240]  They're being introduced to your grow.
[02:35.240 --> 02:39.520]  They can contaminate your entire grow with whatever problems they've got.
[02:39.520 --> 02:40.720]  They come with free bugs.
[02:40.720 --> 02:41.840]  They come with free mildew.
[02:41.840 --> 02:45.320]  They come with all kinds of free funk that you did not expect.
[02:45.320 --> 02:50.400]  So as a responsible grower, as a responsible farmer, it is your responsibility and your
[02:50.400 --> 02:53.760]  job to quarantine that incoming clone.
[02:53.760 --> 02:57.560]  If you get a new plant, a little baby plant, I don't care how big it is, how small it is.
[02:57.560 --> 03:00.680]  I don't care how much you trust that other person.
[03:00.680 --> 03:04.400]  If you get a plant, quarantine it, treat it like it's got a problem.
[03:04.400 --> 03:05.400]  Treat it with the fungicide.
[03:05.400 --> 03:06.920]  Treat it with the pesticide.
[03:06.920 --> 03:10.920]  Do whatever your routine is to make sure that it does not have problems.
[03:10.920 --> 03:14.160]  I treat things in a certain way because I work in a commercial grow environment.
[03:14.160 --> 03:16.200]  I am exposed to a lot of things.
[03:16.200 --> 03:19.040]  I expose those commercial grows to a lot of things.
[03:19.040 --> 03:23.000]  I can't get a clone from a friend that's got mites on it and then take it to a commercial
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.360]  grow and contaminate one of those multimillion dollar commercial facilities.
[03:27.360 --> 03:30.760]  So when I get a clone, the first thing I do is I treat it with pesticides.
[03:30.760 --> 03:33.400]  I'm not even going to tell you what I use because I will get flack for it.
[03:33.400 --> 03:34.400]  I'll get feedback.
[03:34.400 --> 03:38.120]  All I have to do is say the word pesticide on the show and people start messaging me
[03:38.120 --> 03:40.080]  and leaving poor comments.
[03:40.080 --> 03:41.780]  So pesticide, there you go.
[03:41.780 --> 03:46.400]  But it will be treated with appropriate pesticides, appropriate fungicides to ensure that I do
[03:46.400 --> 03:49.640]  not get any bugs or problems from an incoming clone.
[03:49.640 --> 03:52.500]  I don't want bonuses with my clones.
[03:52.500 --> 03:58.260]  I want genetics, not bugs, not mildews, not issues, not problems, not shit that I did
[03:58.260 --> 03:59.260]  not expect.
[03:59.260 --> 04:02.260]  So it's my responsibility to put that clone in another area.
[04:02.260 --> 04:05.900]  I've got a main grow space a little further away from that main grow space.
[04:05.900 --> 04:09.980]  I've got another small light where I can house a couple of incoming plants.
[04:09.980 --> 04:10.980]  It's nothing major.
[04:10.980 --> 04:14.060]  It's not an impressive grow space, but it will keep plants there for a week and it will
[04:14.060 --> 04:15.060]  keep them alive.
[04:15.060 --> 04:19.440]  That way I don't have to introduce them to the general population, get everybody in general
[04:19.440 --> 04:20.940]  population sick.
[04:20.940 --> 04:25.460]  I'm sure you understand with the pandemic we just went through, you can get everybody
[04:25.460 --> 04:28.020]  sick with just one contaminated, infected person.
[04:28.020 --> 04:30.140]  The plants work the same damn way.
[04:30.140 --> 04:34.000]  So when the plants are coming into the grow from a friend, let's quarantine them for seven
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.000]  to 10 days.
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.180]  If you can at least five to seven days, keep them away from the rest of the plants, treat
[04:39.180 --> 04:42.760]  them with the appropriate pesticide fungicide.
[04:42.760 --> 04:44.520]  Maybe you're going to put predator mites on them.
[04:44.520 --> 04:47.500]  Maybe you're going to put it in a really hot room and heat up the temperature to get rid
[04:47.500 --> 04:48.500]  of the bug eggs.
[04:48.500 --> 04:52.760]  I want you to know your approach, but have a strategy to make sure that those bugs are
[04:52.760 --> 04:56.220]  gone before you get to the main grow space.
[04:56.220 --> 04:59.500]  Imagine if I brought just a clone home and it had mites on it.
[04:59.500 --> 05:01.340]  I took it into my grow space.
[05:01.340 --> 05:06.200]  Then I went to do a consultation at a commercial cultivation facility and they got my spider
[05:06.200 --> 05:07.200]  mites.
[05:07.200 --> 05:08.700]  How bad of a dick would I be?
[05:08.700 --> 05:12.060]  They probably wouldn't even know that the mites came from me, but I would know.
[05:12.060 --> 05:15.040]  And then I can't be mad at the person that gave me spider mites.
[05:15.040 --> 05:18.480]  It is my responsibility to protect myself.
[05:18.480 --> 05:19.920]  He says, I don't have mites, dude.
[05:19.920 --> 05:20.920]  I don't have mold.
[05:20.920 --> 05:21.920]  I don't have thrips.
[05:21.920 --> 05:23.320]  I don't have anything.
[05:23.320 --> 05:24.320]  Get a clone from them.
[05:24.320 --> 05:27.160]  That's how you find out that they do have spider mites.
[05:27.160 --> 05:29.120]  They do have thrips.
[05:29.120 --> 05:31.720]  So I am not perfect, you guys.
[05:31.720 --> 05:32.920]  Why am I talking about this?
[05:32.920 --> 05:33.920]  Because guess what?
[05:33.920 --> 05:36.120]  I got a clone that I thought I quarantined it properly.
[05:36.120 --> 05:41.800]  I thought I did the appropriate measures, but it had some ferocious fucking spider mites
[05:41.800 --> 05:42.800]  on it.
[05:42.800 --> 05:44.680]  So I ended up dealing with a little bit of a spider mite battle.
[05:44.680 --> 05:45.680]  Not a big deal.
[05:45.680 --> 05:46.680]  I'm an experienced gardener.
[05:46.680 --> 05:50.600]  I know what I'm doing, but I had to go to the big two commercial grows where I've been
[05:50.600 --> 05:52.800]  recently and say, Hey, I had spider mites.
[05:52.800 --> 05:56.120]  And it's like going to somebody and saying like, fucking, Hey, I had a fucked up STD
[05:56.120 --> 05:58.400]  test and you might want to get tested too.
[05:58.400 --> 05:59.760]  It's the same fucking feeling.
[05:59.760 --> 06:02.880]  So I had to go to these grows and say, Hey guys, I had mites in my garden, dude.
[06:02.880 --> 06:06.400]  You might want to up your game or do some extra shit.
[06:06.400 --> 06:09.760]  I didn't take plants to their grow, but I've been there.
[06:09.760 --> 06:12.400]  I'm sure I carry a spider mite on me.
[06:12.400 --> 06:14.480]  You know, I came from one grow to the other.
[06:14.480 --> 06:15.780]  The mites are microscopic.
[06:15.780 --> 06:18.620]  One could have been on my pants, on my shirt.
[06:18.620 --> 06:19.980]  Someone's going to say they're in your dreads.
[06:19.980 --> 06:21.460]  I'm waiting for the joke to come already.
[06:21.460 --> 06:25.940]  Nothing new, but yes, it's very likely I carried a spider mite to these commercial grows.
[06:25.940 --> 06:30.700]  Luckily we are very diligent with our pest management systems at those commercial grows.
[06:30.700 --> 06:35.980]  We do things when we walk in, we suit up at one of the places we actually wear Tyvek suits,
[06:35.980 --> 06:39.380]  got my hair in a bun and in a hat with like a hairnet thing over it.
[06:39.380 --> 06:40.860]  That place is fairly well protected.
[06:40.860 --> 06:46.540]  The other place is so pesticide crazy and they're really clean about everything.
[06:46.540 --> 06:49.500]  I don't think we're going to get any bug problems, but it is possible.
[06:49.500 --> 06:52.140]  So I went there and I said, Hey guys, guess what?
[06:52.140 --> 06:53.140]  I had spider mites.
[06:53.140 --> 06:54.220]  So you might too.
[06:54.220 --> 06:57.820]  And really it's the same feeling as giving a fucking negative STD result.
[06:57.820 --> 07:01.900]  You're like, you got to call people and be like, Hey, you might want to go to the doctor.
[07:01.900 --> 07:05.300]  But again, it was my responsibility, just like an STD test.
[07:05.300 --> 07:08.120]  It was my responsibility to make sure my shit was safe.
[07:08.120 --> 07:09.120]  Just like it's your responsibility.
[07:09.120 --> 07:10.120]  All right.
[07:10.380 --> 07:12.280]  So like I said, I wasn't going to go on too long about one thing.
[07:12.280 --> 07:16.600]  I think we went long enough about quarantine, your incoming clones, treat them the day you
[07:16.600 --> 07:20.080]  get that clone, treat it with the pesticide, put it in a room, turn the light off for an
[07:20.080 --> 07:24.000]  hour, treat it with a pesticide, whatever you prefer, however you prefer to do it.
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.860]  Treat it with something that's going to ensure you that you're not getting a problem.
[07:27.860 --> 07:30.700]  Maybe this plant is an incoming mother plant.
[07:30.700 --> 07:32.800]  Maybe you're not even going to consume this plant.
[07:32.800 --> 07:34.720]  Maybe this is just the one that's coming in.
[07:34.720 --> 07:37.400]  You can spray that one with fucking anything you choose.
[07:37.400 --> 07:41.840]  If you're not going to consume it, just blast it with something crazy, put it in the grow,
[07:41.840 --> 07:43.640]  let it grow, take a few clones out of it.
[07:43.640 --> 07:47.080]  I know people are going to say half-life and that good stuff, but sometimes you've got
[07:47.080 --> 07:49.760]  to do what you have got to do.
[07:49.760 --> 07:53.440]  If your life and your, uh, your goals and your business depend on it, you may have to
[07:53.440 --> 07:56.680]  do some things just if you're not going to consume that plant, you can treat it with
[07:56.680 --> 07:58.320]  whatever down the line.
[07:58.320 --> 08:00.720]  People are going to say that pesticides in there, but we will clone it.
[08:00.720 --> 08:02.660]  It will work itself out over time.
[08:02.660 --> 08:06.360]  We just need to get rid of that bug to get this plant into the grow so we can work with
[08:06.360 --> 08:08.440]  it to save it, to make it acceptable.
[08:08.440 --> 08:14.360]  So treat that plant however you feel necessary, but beware incoming clones, especially from
[08:14.360 --> 08:19.080]  a dispensary grow that's going to have bugs on it, dude, not to point fingers at the dispensaries.
[08:19.080 --> 08:20.080]  It's just hard.
[08:20.080 --> 08:21.080]  It's such a big facility.
[08:21.080 --> 08:23.960]  Once you get a pest outbreak, it becomes challenging.
[08:23.960 --> 08:27.960]  So if you've got the clone from the dispensary, please do quarantine it, treat it, treat it
[08:27.960 --> 08:31.880]  the day you get it, then treat it like three to five, maybe seven days later, treat it
[08:31.880 --> 08:34.180]  again, then pull a leaf off of it.
[08:34.180 --> 08:36.580]  Look at it under a microscope, under a magnifying glass.
[08:36.580 --> 08:38.500]  Do you see, you may see some dead eggs.
[08:38.500 --> 08:43.020]  You may see some shit left on there from before, but do you see anything moving, anything viable,
[08:43.020 --> 08:45.980]  anything alive, anything that will be a problem or a threat?
[08:45.980 --> 08:50.580]  If so, leave that fucker in quarantine and keep treating it until the problem is gone.
[08:50.580 --> 08:52.420]  If it's a small plant, you can dunk it.
[08:52.420 --> 08:56.980]  I've showed you in previous episodes how to do a dunk, that dunk we did right before we
[08:56.980 --> 08:59.540]  pop the clones into the clone gel.
[08:59.540 --> 09:00.820]  You can hold the plant.
[09:00.820 --> 09:04.500]  So if you've got the plant coming out of a cup or a small pot, I've got big hands.
[09:04.500 --> 09:08.900]  I can put my hand over the top of the pot and basically hold most of the soil in and
[09:08.900 --> 09:12.860]  have the stick coming out from between my fingers so that my hand is working like a
[09:12.860 --> 09:14.180]  lid to cover the soil.
[09:14.180 --> 09:16.980]  The stem of the plant still sticks up between my fingers.
[09:16.980 --> 09:20.140]  I just flip the plant upside down and gently dunk it into the pesticide.
[09:20.140 --> 09:24.400]  Give it a couple of swooshes, a couple of plunges, take it out, let it dry off.
[09:24.400 --> 09:29.540]  If you want to rinse it with clean water after that, that is acceptable or spray it down
[09:29.540 --> 09:30.980]  with clean water.
[09:30.980 --> 09:34.420]  This plant should be big enough and safe enough to where it's not going to get any phototoxicity.
[09:34.420 --> 09:39.020]  Oh yeah, in a previous episode, I did say the word phytotoxicity.
[09:39.020 --> 09:41.460]  I didn't have any notes and I was talking fast.
[09:41.460 --> 09:42.660]  I said the wrong word.
[09:42.660 --> 09:43.660]  You're correct.
[09:43.660 --> 09:44.660]  Thank you for the updates.
[09:44.660 --> 09:46.060]  Sometimes I'm going to say the wrong shit.
[09:46.060 --> 09:49.900]  You talk for countless hours by yourself and don't say anything wrong.
[09:49.900 --> 09:51.820]  Anyway, give that plant a dunk.
[09:51.820 --> 09:53.540]  Give it a rinse if you want.
[09:53.540 --> 09:55.020]  Don't put it under light for several hours.
[09:55.020 --> 09:56.380]  Let that pesticide work its thing.
[09:56.380 --> 09:57.900]  Let it kind of dry off under there.
[09:57.900 --> 10:01.100]  Then when it's time, put the lights back on, check the plants, make sure there's no
[10:01.100 --> 10:02.100]  bugs.
[10:02.100 --> 10:06.420]  All right, for a quick fucking chatter on that one, I went for a long time.
[10:06.420 --> 10:07.420]  Let's see.
[10:07.420 --> 10:08.420]  We've been going for ... We got plenty of time.
[10:08.420 --> 10:09.420]  All right.
[10:09.420 --> 10:15.020]  I also saw somebody on social media say that the rec market was looking sad in Colorado,
[10:15.020 --> 10:20.500]  that the medical marijuana is much better than the recreational cannabis.
[10:20.500 --> 10:23.180]  I just had to chime in with a small correction.
[10:23.180 --> 10:27.220]  I asked them, what is the difference between the recreational cannabis and the medical
[10:27.540 --> 10:28.540]  cannabis?
[10:28.540 --> 10:31.780]  They couldn't tell me any differences in the actual plants and the flowers.
[10:31.780 --> 10:37.460]  They kept saying that the taxes were too high and that none of their statements supported
[10:37.460 --> 10:41.300]  the statement that the product was better or that there was a difference.
[10:41.300 --> 10:46.580]  That's because I work in recreational and commercial grows.
[10:46.580 --> 10:52.640]  I was a cultivation manager for a facility that on one side of the building, one side
[10:52.640 --> 10:55.900]  of the parking lot, we had a recreational grow.
[10:55.900 --> 10:59.740]  On the other side, we had a medical grow.
[10:59.740 --> 11:01.100]  They were growing the exact same way.
[11:01.100 --> 11:04.780]  We modeled the two grows after each other to where we could have standard operating
[11:04.780 --> 11:08.940]  procedures that worked in both buildings, so we didn't have to train new growers like,
[11:08.940 --> 11:12.100]  hey, we grow the medical weed this way and we grow the rec weed this way.
[11:12.100 --> 11:15.000]  No, we grow it all the best we fucking can.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.220]  We had the same ... Let me be honest with you.
[11:17.220 --> 11:20.820]  In one building, we had better shit because it was a newer building and we learned a lot,
[11:20.820 --> 11:21.820]  but that was just timing.
[11:21.820 --> 11:24.460]  That was just fucking because it was the future.
[11:24.460 --> 11:27.020]  The next podcast studio will be better because it will be better.
[11:27.020 --> 11:28.020]  There will be new shit.
[11:28.020 --> 11:30.900]  We'll have learned something, but it will be mirrored after this, just upgraded.
[11:30.900 --> 11:35.420]  Honestly, it was a little bit different just because technology, but then the next grow
[11:35.420 --> 11:39.500]  will be a little bit better, but we're doing all the same shit in both facilities.
[11:39.500 --> 11:43.560]  We've got the same lighting, the same HVAC system, the same nutrients.
[11:43.560 --> 11:47.220]  It is the same clones.
[11:47.220 --> 11:52.040]  You're allowed to enter clones into your system at a certain time when your facility is new.
[11:52.040 --> 11:53.940]  You can get them from certain sources.
[11:53.940 --> 11:58.200]  We were able to get the same clones sourced for the commercial or for the recreational
[11:58.200 --> 12:00.260]  facility as we did the medical.
[12:00.260 --> 12:01.620]  We've got ... Pick a strain.
[12:01.620 --> 12:02.700]  I'm just going to say Arise.
[12:02.700 --> 12:06.460]  We got Arise at the medical and Arise at the recreational facility.
[12:06.460 --> 12:08.780]  Same clone, same cut, same plant, same breeder.
[12:08.780 --> 12:09.780]  Shout out to Arise, by the way.
[12:09.780 --> 12:11.940]  I'm rocking the Arise t-shirt today.
[12:11.940 --> 12:14.460]  Grab your Arise t-shirt at iRegenetics.com.
[12:14.460 --> 12:15.460]  Click on the iRestore.
[12:15.460 --> 12:16.460]  It'll get you right there.
[12:16.460 --> 12:20.100]  If you were signed up for the newsletter, you did get a fatty coupon code that'll help you
[12:20.100 --> 12:21.100]  out.
[12:21.100 --> 12:23.420]  We got Arise in the recreational and Arise in the medical grow.
[12:23.420 --> 12:24.420]  Guess what?
[12:24.420 --> 12:26.780]  I feed them both the exact same nutrients.
[12:26.780 --> 12:29.740]  I feed them the same day, the same fucking thing.
[12:29.740 --> 12:32.100]  They get sprayed the exact same pesticides.
[12:32.100 --> 12:34.500]  They get sprayed the same foliar feeds.
[12:34.500 --> 12:37.540]  They get popped and twisted and defoliated the same.
[12:37.540 --> 12:38.540]  Then guess what?
[12:38.540 --> 12:39.940]  Here is something that may blow your mind.
[12:39.940 --> 12:43.020]  They are watered and fed by the same Grotex.
[12:43.020 --> 12:44.020]  That's right.
[12:44.020 --> 12:45.700]  We have two buildings across the street from each other.
[12:45.700 --> 12:49.620]  These guys work over here from morning till lunch, then they travel across the way, and
[12:49.620 --> 12:52.220]  then from lunch to the end of the day, they work on the other side.
[12:52.220 --> 12:56.580]  The same dudes are watering the same plants, doing the same popping and twisting and lollipopping.
[12:56.580 --> 13:01.540]  The same techs are working on the recreational and the medical marijuana plants.
[13:01.540 --> 13:03.020]  I don't like the word marijuana plants.
[13:03.020 --> 13:04.420]  It didn't feel good.
[13:04.420 --> 13:05.420]  Recreational cannabis.
[13:05.420 --> 13:08.780]  When I say medical marijuana, it flows, it works, but recreational, I'm not going to
[13:08.780 --> 13:09.780]  say it.
[13:09.780 --> 13:10.780]  Recreational marijuana, again, that was weird.
[13:10.780 --> 13:12.020]  You guys, I'm good and stoned.
[13:12.020 --> 13:13.020]  Had some fatty dabs today.
[13:13.020 --> 13:16.020]  Shout out to the dirty business dabs from Green Dot Labs.
[13:16.020 --> 13:17.900]  I enjoy that shit.
[13:17.900 --> 13:19.080]  So it's the same Grotex.
[13:19.080 --> 13:20.080]  Then guess what?
[13:20.400 --> 13:25.360]  At the end, it is the same harvest crew, the same trimmers, trim the recreational and the
[13:25.360 --> 13:27.640]  medical herb, the same people.
[13:27.640 --> 13:28.960]  They just move from building to building.
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.600]  We can't move the product because technically, legally, license-wise, the product has to
[13:32.600 --> 13:36.000]  stay where it is, but the team can move.
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]  They're mobile.
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.920]  They just walk across the parking lot.
[13:38.920 --> 13:44.600]  So sometimes we start the day with Grotex A and Grotex B, you're in building one.
[13:44.600 --> 13:47.200]  Grotex C and Grotex G, you're in building two.
[13:47.200 --> 13:49.720]  And then trim crew, we need you over here.
[13:50.360 --> 13:51.360]  And that's how the day starts.
[13:51.360 --> 13:53.760]  We just assign people to rooms and buildings and they go where they need to go and they
[13:53.760 --> 13:56.160]  get comfortable and they do the day in that building.
[13:56.160 --> 13:59.320]  Or we'll do half of it over here, half of it over here.
[13:59.320 --> 14:04.520]  Being the lead guy, I do fucking half of it in this building, half of it in this building,
[14:04.520 --> 14:05.880]  and then the other half in the office.
[14:05.880 --> 14:08.760]  And I know that's three halves of a day, but you be the manager and you'll know what the
[14:08.760 --> 14:09.760]  fuck I mean.
[14:09.760 --> 14:14.480]  All right, so the recreational and the commercial are the exact same thing.
[14:14.480 --> 14:15.680]  Now here's something I want to talk about.
[14:15.680 --> 14:20.760]  Since we're talking about growing in a commercial environment, commercial cultivators, I'm going
[14:20.760 --> 14:23.960]  to kind of direct part of this podcast at you right now.
[14:23.960 --> 14:29.080]  The biggest part of being on a commercial cultivation team is knowing your role in the
[14:29.080 --> 14:33.080]  team and understanding your part on the team.
[14:33.080 --> 14:37.160]  Does the lead grower need you to do a certain thing, learn that part and fucking do that
[14:37.160 --> 14:38.160]  part?
[14:38.160 --> 14:42.240]  Or do we need you to be the jack of all trades where I can rely on you for if this guy calls
[14:42.240 --> 14:45.440]  off or if that guy calls off, can you cover their job?
[14:45.480 --> 14:47.360]  Understand your role in the team.
[14:47.360 --> 14:49.120]  Understand that there is a big picture.
[14:49.120 --> 14:53.440]  Understand that you may not like this one detail that we've got to do, but that one
[14:53.440 --> 14:57.280]  detail is what makes these other three things fucking possible.
[14:57.280 --> 14:59.100]  So just understand your role.
[14:59.100 --> 15:01.260]  Understand that there is a bigger picture.
[15:01.260 --> 15:04.280]  Understand that yeah, you've got some shit on your mind and your day and your things,
[15:04.280 --> 15:07.440]  but there is a big picture in this cultivation facility.
[15:07.440 --> 15:11.680]  The lead cultivator or a term that I'm going to touch on in a minute, the master grower
[15:11.680 --> 15:13.760]  knows what is going on.
[15:13.760 --> 15:17.240]  Everybody in the building has got a map and unless you're the one with the map that knows
[15:17.240 --> 15:20.840]  how to get from point A to point B and you know the goal and you've spoken to everybody
[15:20.840 --> 15:25.880]  on the team, just kind of find your spot and understand your role on the team.
[15:25.880 --> 15:26.920]  Everybody is just as important.
[15:26.920 --> 15:30.520]  The fucking tremors are just as important as the grow techs are just as important as
[15:30.520 --> 15:34.760]  the fucking tech leads are just as important as the master grower are just as important
[15:34.760 --> 15:40.000]  as the consultant are just as important as the investors are just as important as the
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.400]  owners because without all of them, the shit does not work.
[15:44.400 --> 15:48.800]  If the owner doesn't own it and pay all the people down the line, the shit doesn't happen.
[15:48.800 --> 15:53.280]  But if the tremors don't trim the herb, there's no fucking product to be fucking had and everybody
[15:53.280 --> 15:55.480]  down the line has to do their part.
[15:55.480 --> 15:59.880]  So figure out, try to understand the bigger picture in the cultivation facility.
[15:59.880 --> 16:03.960]  It's not just you're sitting there trimming weeds so that the owner can drive a Porsche.
[16:03.960 --> 16:05.560]  The owner's got a lot on the fucking line.
[16:05.560 --> 16:09.860]  The owner had to establish money to acquire licenses and buildings and they're giving
[16:09.860 --> 16:10.860]  you a job.
[16:10.860 --> 16:15.940]  So understand how the whole dynamic of that building, it's not just you listening to three
[16:15.940 --> 16:21.180]  11 all day, fucking trim and herb or you sprinkling water on these plants or you being tortured
[16:21.180 --> 16:23.380]  because you've got to defoliate all day.
[16:23.380 --> 16:24.860]  It's a big, big picture in there.
[16:24.860 --> 16:29.500]  So be part of the team, understand your position and play your fucking role really, really
[16:29.500 --> 16:30.740]  well.
[16:30.740 --> 16:35.100]  Watch those videos on YouTube where the people from other cultures can grab a fruit off the
[16:35.160 --> 16:38.480]  tree and cut it into the shape of a butterfly and season it and fucking serve it to you
[16:38.480 --> 16:41.900]  in 17 seconds and do 30 of them without taking a break.
[16:41.900 --> 16:42.900]  Get your job like that.
[16:42.900 --> 16:44.660]  Your grow team will love you.
[16:44.660 --> 16:49.220]  Your grow lead, the master grower will notice it and appreciate you.
[16:49.220 --> 16:52.260]  That stuff gets mentioned to the investors, gets mentioned to the owners.
[16:52.260 --> 16:53.260]  Then guess what?
[16:53.260 --> 16:57.020]  When it's bonus time, when it's raise time, guess who gets the bonuses and raises.
[16:57.020 --> 17:01.420]  Then when I leave that facility because I've had enough, because I just get ADD and I get
[17:01.420 --> 17:02.420]  bored.
[17:02.420 --> 17:04.860]  I just go in and get a facility run in and then have it smooth.
[17:04.860 --> 17:07.220]  And then somebody will call and they'll say, Hey, my grow is falling apart.
[17:07.220 --> 17:08.220]  Can you come help?
[17:08.220 --> 17:09.220]  And I'll go, I'm going to go there now.
[17:09.220 --> 17:10.220]  And then guess what?
[17:10.220 --> 17:13.740]  It's time for the person that was shining the most when I was there.
[17:13.740 --> 17:18.780]  I recommend they take over my position and now they get to be the grow lead or the master
[17:18.780 --> 17:19.780]  grower.
[17:19.780 --> 17:22.220]  You guys, I don't like the term master grower as much as you.
[17:22.220 --> 17:25.380]  I was going to save that for the end, but let's jump up to this term.
[17:25.380 --> 17:27.780]  So you guys find your, find your role on the team.
[17:27.780 --> 17:31.700]  A grow is a team, know your spot and the team understand that it is a big team.
[17:31.700 --> 17:34.660]  We're not just going to work every day to do a job.
[17:34.660 --> 17:35.940]  Everybody's got a role.
[17:35.940 --> 17:36.980]  Every player is important.
[17:36.980 --> 17:38.980]  So show up and be important today.
[17:38.980 --> 17:40.660]  Show up and be important.
[17:40.660 --> 17:43.380]  Shine today at work because there are a lot of people that want your job.
[17:43.380 --> 17:48.220]  I've got stis, stis, stis, stacks of applications of people who want your job.
[17:48.220 --> 17:49.740]  So crush it, get out there and do it.
[17:49.740 --> 17:53.180]  Now let's talk about this silly word, master grower.
[17:53.180 --> 17:57.240]  Um, when you're the word master grower, you automatically cringe, right?
[17:57.240 --> 17:58.500]  Social media goes crazy.
[17:58.500 --> 17:59.500]  Relax, bro.
[17:59.500 --> 18:00.500]  Chill out.
[18:00.500 --> 18:03.260]  Nobody thinks they're the fucking ninja master in the grow.
[18:03.260 --> 18:07.460]  When you work at the brewery, the term is master brewer, but nobody's getting uptight
[18:07.460 --> 18:09.220]  over the master brewer.
[18:09.220 --> 18:12.420]  We did not assign ourselves the fucking role of master grower.
[18:12.420 --> 18:13.740]  It's on the application.
[18:13.740 --> 18:15.000]  It's a fucking job title.
[18:15.000 --> 18:16.340]  We're not trying to say I'm the master.
[18:16.340 --> 18:18.620]  I don't have a fucking black belt in the crown.
[18:18.620 --> 18:21.780]  No, I'm the fucking one in charge of the fucking grow.
[18:21.780 --> 18:25.420]  Uh, there are other people in the grow that can have a little say in some opinions, but
[18:25.420 --> 18:29.620]  when it comes down to it, I'm the fucking captain now and we're doing what I say.
[18:29.740 --> 18:31.500]  That's all the term master grower means.
[18:31.500 --> 18:32.500]  Don't get it twisted.
[18:32.500 --> 18:34.860]  Don't think that it makes me think I'm the fucking master.
[18:34.860 --> 18:36.420]  No, I'm the fucking boss.
[18:36.420 --> 18:39.380]  It's just the way of saying motherfucker that is in charge.
[18:39.380 --> 18:40.720]  That's what master grower means.
[18:40.720 --> 18:42.500]  So quit fucking giving people shit about it.
[18:42.500 --> 18:43.860]  Quit being a crybaby about it.
[18:43.860 --> 18:45.540]  That's my two cents on the phrase master grower.
[18:45.540 --> 18:47.340]  It's on the fucking application.
[18:47.340 --> 18:48.340]  It's on the job title.
[18:48.340 --> 18:49.340]  That's all it is.
[18:49.340 --> 18:50.340]  All right.
[18:50.340 --> 18:53.500]  You don't give other people weird shit for their fucking job title, especially the master
[18:53.500 --> 18:54.500]  brewer.
[18:54.500 --> 18:57.220]  Uh, no, you don't, you don't fucking chill out.
[18:57.220 --> 18:58.220]  All right.
[18:58.220 --> 18:59.220]  That's my ramble on that.
[18:59.820 --> 19:00.820]  Let's see.
[19:00.820 --> 19:03.020]  Uh, the part where I was saying, fill your role the best you can and show up and kick
[19:03.020 --> 19:04.020]  ass at work today.
[19:04.020 --> 19:08.460]  That part also applies to a small personal grow.
[19:08.460 --> 19:09.540]  What is your goal?
[19:09.540 --> 19:10.700]  Know your goal.
[19:10.700 --> 19:14.300]  Do you have a plan and a strategy for your personal grow?
[19:14.300 --> 19:15.300]  Why not?
[19:15.300 --> 19:16.300]  What are you doing tomorrow?
[19:16.300 --> 19:17.920]  What needs to be done the next day?
[19:17.920 --> 19:19.300]  Do you know what needs to be done in that?
[19:19.300 --> 19:22.660]  Or are you just kind of flying by the seat of your pants hoping that you get some good
[19:22.660 --> 19:24.260]  product at the end?
[19:24.260 --> 19:28.220]  The more time, the more love, the more energy you put into that grow, the more it is going
[19:28.220 --> 19:29.220]  to show you.
[19:29.220 --> 19:30.220]  Sure.
[19:30.220 --> 19:31.220]  You can fucking grow some weed.
[19:31.220 --> 19:32.220]  Anybody.
[19:32.220 --> 19:34.860]  I hear people say anybody can put some seeds in some dirt and pour some water on it and
[19:34.860 --> 19:35.860]  grow some weed.
[19:35.860 --> 19:36.860]  Sure.
[19:36.860 --> 19:37.860]  You could.
[19:37.860 --> 19:39.380]  Uh, anybody could also paint a fucking painting.
[19:39.380 --> 19:42.220]  You get some canvas and some paint and just fucking splattered on there.
[19:42.220 --> 19:43.220]  Right?
[19:43.220 --> 19:44.220]  Sure.
[19:44.220 --> 19:45.220]  Does anybody give a shit?
[19:45.220 --> 19:46.220]  Is it interesting?
[19:46.220 --> 19:47.220]  Anybody is it quality?
[19:47.220 --> 19:48.220]  Are you even proud of it?
[19:48.220 --> 19:49.220]  Probably not.
[19:49.220 --> 19:52.500]  But if you took your time, took some effort, put some energy into it, put some thought
[19:52.500 --> 19:55.980]  and some heart into it, even if you're painting, it looks like shit in the end to everybody
[19:55.980 --> 19:56.980]  else.
[19:56.980 --> 20:00.020]  You gotta be proud of it because you put pride into it.
[20:00.020 --> 20:04.700]  Your flowers, your ganja garden, your herb, your medicine is the same exact way.
[20:04.700 --> 20:05.700]  Spend some time in there.
[20:05.700 --> 20:06.700]  Love it.
[20:06.700 --> 20:07.700]  Care for it.
[20:07.700 --> 20:09.100]  Do some research, have a plan.
[20:09.100 --> 20:13.340]  Um, again though, don't go over there in there and fucking just over love it.
[20:13.340 --> 20:16.700]  Sometimes you just got to get out of there and let it do its thing, but you wouldn't
[20:16.700 --> 20:22.060]  take a puppy home and not have a leash, a collar, a puppy bowl, like a dog bowl, a fucking
[20:22.060 --> 20:23.060]  water bowl.
[20:23.060 --> 20:24.740]  Uh, maybe a puppy bed.
[20:24.740 --> 20:28.260]  Maybe you better have some pee pads and some fucking napkins or something to clean up all
[20:28.260 --> 20:30.660]  this dog piss and shit you're going to have to deal with.
[20:30.660 --> 20:31.660]  You kind of prepare.
[20:31.660 --> 20:35.340]  You don't bring a baby home without a fucking bassinet and a blanket and a crib.
[20:35.340 --> 20:36.340]  At least most of us don't.
[20:36.340 --> 20:37.940]  A lot of us, maybe you fucking did.
[20:37.940 --> 20:39.460]  And sorry if I'm calling you out.
[20:39.460 --> 20:43.300]  But my point is, if you've got cannabis plants, be fucking prepared.
[20:43.300 --> 20:47.940]  You have got pets, you've got plants, you've got a project, you've spent money on the lights,
[20:47.940 --> 20:49.180]  the soil, the grow space.
[20:49.180 --> 20:50.940]  You have built some stuff.
[20:50.940 --> 20:53.620]  You care about it enough to have an environment for it.
[20:53.620 --> 20:54.700]  So let's put some thought into it.
[20:54.700 --> 20:55.860]  Let's understand the plants.
[20:55.860 --> 20:56.860]  Have a goal.
[20:56.860 --> 20:57.860]  Do you know your goal?
[20:57.860 --> 20:59.540]  Do you know your strategy?
[20:59.540 --> 21:00.660]  Do you know what you're doing?
[21:00.660 --> 21:04.820]  Or are you coming to social media every Monday saying, what should I have done to my plants?
[21:04.820 --> 21:05.820]  What is going on?
[21:05.820 --> 21:08.060]  Because that's going to set you up for failure.
[21:08.060 --> 21:10.100]  Um, I love social media.
[21:10.100 --> 21:11.100]  I love the internet.
[21:11.100 --> 21:14.660]  I'm on the internet teaching you how to grow, but everybody thinks they know how to grow
[21:14.660 --> 21:16.380]  and they don't know your situation.
[21:16.380 --> 21:21.100]  They don't know what you're doing and they think their way is the best and the only way
[21:21.220 --> 21:26.540]  As a experienced longtime cultivator, I know that there are thousands of ways to skin this
[21:26.540 --> 21:27.680]  fucking cat.
[21:27.680 --> 21:29.300]  We can grow cannabis on the moon.
[21:29.300 --> 21:30.980]  We can grow cannabis in dirt.
[21:30.980 --> 21:34.020]  We can grow cannabis in soilless mixes, cocoa.
[21:34.020 --> 21:35.020]  We don't even need dirt.
[21:35.020 --> 21:37.500]  You can suspend that shit in water and grow it.
[21:37.500 --> 21:38.980]  All of those ways are right.
[21:38.980 --> 21:41.240]  They're all absolutely correct.
[21:41.240 --> 21:44.420]  You can top it, you can fend it, you can pop it, you can twist it, or you can leave it
[21:44.420 --> 21:45.420]  the fuck alone.
[21:45.420 --> 21:46.420]  And guess what?
[21:46.420 --> 21:47.860]  All of those ways are correct.
[21:47.860 --> 21:51.340]  So when you go to the internet and somebody says, you have to do this, you don't have
[21:51.340 --> 21:52.340]  to do shit.
[21:52.340 --> 21:54.980]  You have to have fun in there and you have to grow it and not burn the place down.
[21:54.980 --> 21:59.420]  That's fucking basically all you have to do is if the plant's tired, the place burns down,
[21:59.420 --> 22:00.620]  you fucked up and failed.
[22:00.620 --> 22:02.220]  If you're happy with your outcome, you did it right.
[22:02.220 --> 22:06.360]  But if you have a strategy and you know what you're doing, you got a book and a goal and
[22:06.360 --> 22:09.820]  some sort of ideas, you'll have a much more successful outcome.
[22:09.820 --> 22:14.420]  So set a strategy, set a goal, read some books, read about like week one.
[22:14.420 --> 22:16.700]  This is what I should expect when you're going to have a baby.
[22:16.700 --> 22:20.100]  They sell you that book, What to Expect When You're Expecting, and it tells you on week,
[22:20.100 --> 22:22.540]  on month one, expect this month to expect this.
[22:22.540 --> 22:25.860]  And then it's like on month nine, you're going to have a fucking baby or month 10, the baby
[22:25.860 --> 22:27.820]  comes out, then you get this.
[22:27.820 --> 22:29.740]  There are books for cannabis just like that.
[22:29.740 --> 22:32.060]  And they'll tell you what to expect every week.
[22:32.060 --> 22:33.820]  And there's only nine weeks of flowers.
[22:33.820 --> 22:37.280]  You've only got to read nine weeks and it's about a page per week.
[22:37.280 --> 22:38.340]  Should be able to figure that out.
[22:38.340 --> 22:42.820]  So get a book, listen to some podcasts and know what to expect every week that's coming
[22:42.820 --> 22:43.820]  up.
[22:43.820 --> 22:44.820]  That way you can be prepared.
[22:44.940 --> 22:49.780]  And then you can go to Facebook and say, hey, I kind of grow weed 63 at facebook.net.
[22:49.780 --> 22:50.820]  How do I do this?
[22:50.820 --> 22:54.140]  Because they're, everybody on there is going to have fucking different opinions and they're
[22:54.140 --> 22:56.000]  all going to fuck up your garden for you.
[22:56.000 --> 23:03.380]  So read your books, read a book, have an educated fucking basis of doing what, have an educated.
[23:03.380 --> 23:05.340]  Yeah, I know what I'm trying to say.
[23:05.340 --> 23:08.340]  Have an education, have some sort of a basis and understanding.
[23:08.340 --> 23:10.380]  So you know why you're doing what you're doing.
[23:10.380 --> 23:11.660]  Think about what you're doing.
[23:11.660 --> 23:15.980]  Think about the outcome and have an education on why not just a bunch of people on social
[23:15.980 --> 23:21.620]  media saying, uh, my uncle bill tried this in 63 and it worked or my friend Larry's cousin
[23:21.620 --> 23:23.380]  Bob says to do this.
[23:23.380 --> 23:28.820]  Uh, read a book from an experienced grow author that can fucking tell you how and why.
[23:28.820 --> 23:33.700]  Uh, also don't be afraid to ask somebody why when somebody says do this to your plants,
[23:33.700 --> 23:38.100]  say why they should have a reason if they can't explain to you why they don't know what
[23:38.100 --> 23:39.100]  the fuck they're talking about.
[23:39.100 --> 23:43.100]  I can explain to you why everything I tell you to do to the plants, there's a reason
[23:43.100 --> 23:44.340]  for it.
[23:44.340 --> 23:45.340]  Also have a goal.
[23:45.340 --> 23:47.980]  Without a goal, there's no reason to do some shit.
[23:47.980 --> 23:49.820]  So I feel like I've been rambling for a long time.
[23:49.820 --> 23:52.380]  I said I wasn't going to ramble too much on one topic here.
[23:52.380 --> 23:54.580]  I fucking lied to you on that part.
[23:54.580 --> 23:56.460]  Um, do you have a plan?
[23:56.460 --> 23:57.900]  You have a strategy.
[23:57.900 --> 24:00.300]  You are the lead grower in your grow.
[24:00.300 --> 24:02.040]  You're also the star employee.
[24:02.040 --> 24:03.540]  Are you going to be the fucking employee of the month?
[24:03.540 --> 24:05.900]  Are you going to be that asshole that we're always looking for?
[24:05.900 --> 24:07.340]  Uh, where's fucking Cletus?
[24:07.580 --> 24:09.380]  You'll never find Cletus when we need him.
[24:09.380 --> 24:11.100]  Oh, he's out back having a cigarette.
[24:11.100 --> 24:12.100]  Okay.
[24:12.100 --> 24:13.300]  He's on his phone somewhere.
[24:13.300 --> 24:15.700]  You can either be Cletus or you could be Rasta Jeff.
[24:15.700 --> 24:16.980]  Hey, shout out to my buddy Cletus.
[24:16.980 --> 24:18.500]  I'm just fucking with you, bro.
[24:18.500 --> 24:20.220]  Just pick that name because it was good.
[24:20.220 --> 24:23.700]  Um, I think that's all I'm going to ramble on for this episode.
[24:23.700 --> 24:26.940]  I've been going for, I feel like just over 25 minutes.
[24:26.940 --> 24:28.960]  That's long enough for a Thursday show.
[24:28.960 --> 24:31.240]  The last couple episodes were fucking real intense.
[24:31.240 --> 24:33.180]  So I guess we can have a fun one this time.
[24:33.180 --> 24:37.420]  A lot of this episode was inspired by my Instagram lives.
[24:37.420 --> 24:43.940]  Every Monday at approximately 7 or 7 10 PM mountain time, I go on Instagram live.
[24:43.940 --> 24:46.540]  My Instagram is iree underscore genetics.
[24:46.540 --> 24:48.660]  I R I E underscore genetics.
[24:48.660 --> 24:51.960]  By the way, that word is Irie, not eerie.
[24:51.960 --> 24:52.960]  It's Irie.
[24:52.960 --> 24:53.960]  It's a Jamaican word.
[24:53.960 --> 24:56.540]  It means like powerful and pleasing.
[24:56.540 --> 24:59.940]  You know that feeling when you're like sitting on the beach or you're sitting on a mountaintop
[24:59.940 --> 25:04.860]  and you just smoked a fatty and either got your girlfriend or your dog or none of them
[25:04.860 --> 25:08.700]  sitting next to you and you got some wind in your hair and it just feels fucking good
[25:08.700 --> 25:10.220]  and everything is right.
[25:10.220 --> 25:11.220]  Nothing is wrong.
[25:11.220 --> 25:13.220]  You're just like, I feel good.
[25:13.220 --> 25:14.220]  That's Irie.
[25:14.220 --> 25:15.620]  Just feeling Irie.
[25:15.620 --> 25:16.940]  Just feeling good.
[25:16.940 --> 25:18.420]  Nothing can bother me.
[25:18.420 --> 25:19.900]  Nothing's fucking wrong.
[25:19.900 --> 25:20.900]  Even things are wrong.
[25:20.900 --> 25:21.900]  Fuck it.
[25:21.900 --> 25:22.900]  I don't care.
[25:22.900 --> 25:23.900]  Things are going to be, that's all right, dude.
[25:23.900 --> 25:26.520]  Feeling Irie, feeling blessed, feeling good.
[25:26.520 --> 25:27.860]  So it's Irie.
[25:28.020 --> 25:31.340]  Anyway, Irie underscore genetics on Instagram.
[25:31.340 --> 25:35.260]  Every Monday around 710-ish Mountain Time, I go on to Instagram Live.
[25:35.260 --> 25:36.260]  I hang out.
[25:36.260 --> 25:37.780]  I answer grow questions.
[25:37.780 --> 25:38.780]  I get rambly.
[25:38.780 --> 25:39.820]  I take a bunch of dabs.
[25:39.820 --> 25:40.900]  We listen to music.
[25:40.900 --> 25:41.900]  It is a good time.
[25:41.900 --> 25:46.020]  If you enjoyed this show, I think you will enjoy the Monday night Instagram Lives.
[25:46.020 --> 25:50.940]  So make sure you give me a follow and check us out Monday on the Instagram Live.
[25:50.940 --> 25:56.060]  Oh, also when Cannabuzz gets their shit together and they do the live feed where I can actually
[25:56.060 --> 26:00.220]  read the comments, I will do that on Cannabuzz more, but I cannot see the comments.
[26:00.220 --> 26:04.100]  So I'm up there talking and you're leaving comments and I can't see the comments on Cannabuzz.
[26:04.100 --> 26:05.740]  So that feels a little bit weird.
[26:05.740 --> 26:09.980]  When they get those comments updated, I will definitely do that.
[26:09.980 --> 26:11.220]  That is really all I've got for you.
[26:11.220 --> 26:12.220]  Make sure you check me out on Instagram.
[26:12.220 --> 26:14.980]  Give me a follow on Cannabuzz.
[26:14.980 --> 26:17.620]  If you've got any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, I would love to hear
[26:17.620 --> 26:18.620]  from you.
[26:18.620 --> 26:21.940]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[26:21.940 --> 26:22.940]  Don't be shy.
[26:22.940 --> 26:26.860]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, concerns, friendly feedback, your critical
[26:26.860 --> 26:28.620]  criticism, I'm all about it.
[26:28.620 --> 26:29.620]  Don't be shy.
[26:29.620 --> 26:33.180]  Also, if you feel like the episode was educational, informative, or entertaining, maybe you'd
[26:33.180 --> 26:36.300]  like to support the show financially, just throw me a couple of bucks because you learned
[26:36.300 --> 26:37.300]  something.
[26:37.300 --> 26:40.940]  The Patreon is patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[26:40.940 --> 26:43.700]  Again there's a link in the show notes, a link in the video description.
[26:43.700 --> 26:45.660]  It takes you right to Patreon.
[26:45.660 --> 26:46.660]  Check out the new tiers.
[26:46.660 --> 26:47.660]  Check out the updates.
[26:48.220 --> 26:53.740]  Also I said it once before, but make sure you check out the website, ireenetics.com.
[26:53.740 --> 26:55.660]  That's right, ireenetics.com.
[26:55.660 --> 26:59.540]  Everything Grow From Your Heart podcast, everything Ross to Jeff, everything iRegenetics is on
[26:59.540 --> 27:00.620]  the website.
[27:00.620 --> 27:01.620]  There are vendor links.
[27:01.620 --> 27:03.900]  There are links to these sweet t-shirts.
[27:03.900 --> 27:05.300]  There is a Grow Help tab.
[27:05.300 --> 27:08.820]  If you've got grow questions, you can click on the Grow Help tab.
[27:08.820 --> 27:12.820]  Fill out a questionnaire that will get you the question right to me.
[27:12.820 --> 27:15.060]  I will answer your questions here on the podcast.
[27:15.060 --> 27:17.420]  Also there is a newsletter tab.
[27:18.180 --> 27:21.140]  There's a little part that says stay updated or stay up to date.
[27:21.140 --> 27:24.380]  Putting your email address in there, that will put you on my mailing list.
[27:24.380 --> 27:28.460]  About once a month, maybe every two weeks, I will send you a newsletter that will let
[27:28.460 --> 27:33.140]  you know about coupon codes, vendor updates, special releases, special events, things like
[27:33.140 --> 27:34.620]  that that are coming up.
[27:34.620 --> 27:36.020]  Also you will get a coupon code.
[27:36.020 --> 27:38.300]  I put out a coupon code about once a month.
[27:38.300 --> 27:41.900]  I try to do a coupon code either for the Etsy store or for a seed vendor.
[27:41.900 --> 27:44.100]  Try to give you a cool deal once a month.
[27:44.100 --> 27:45.920]  Make sure you check out the newsletter.
[27:45.920 --> 27:47.100]  You can get the coupon code.
[27:48.100 --> 27:51.660]  This month it was for a pretty fair deal at the Etsy store.
[27:51.660 --> 27:53.100]  People did take advantage of that.
[27:53.100 --> 27:56.140]  Thank you to everybody that jumped on that deal.
[27:56.140 --> 27:57.340]  Got a lot of packaging to do.
[27:57.340 --> 28:00.540]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[28:00.540 --> 28:04.020]  growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there,
[28:04.020 --> 28:07.580]  I want to thank you once again, not only for listening to the podcast, but for all of the
[28:07.580 --> 28:08.580]  support.
[28:08.580 --> 28:09.580]  You do show me a lot of support.
[28:09.580 --> 28:11.900]  You send me a lot of love, a lot of feedback, a lot of messages.
[28:11.900 --> 28:12.940]  I love you for it.
[28:12.940 --> 28:13.940]  Thank you.
[28:13.940 --> 28:14.940]  That means a lot to me.
[28:14.940 --> 28:15.940]  Keeps me moving.
[28:15.940 --> 28:16.940]  Keeps me inspired.
[28:17.780 --> 28:20.460]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[28:20.460 --> 28:22.900]  I want to give a big shout out to my friend, Papa Z.
[28:22.900 --> 28:26.380]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
