[00:26.190 --> 00:27.190]  Heart podcast.
[00:27.190 --> 00:29.710]  I've got a great show lined up for you.
[00:29.710 --> 00:33.750]  Before we get to the main topic of today's podcast, let's do a few shout outs to a few
[00:33.750 --> 00:38.390]  of the great folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.

[01:14.150 --> 01:16.130]  to Captain Mojo.
[01:16.130 --> 01:21.150]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[01:38.170 --> 01:41.530]  it super easy for all of my friends.
[01:41.530 --> 01:46.030]  This of course is the portion of the show where I invite you to join the discord server.
[01:46.030 --> 01:50.190]  There's an iRegenetics grow from your heart podcast discord server.
[01:50.190 --> 01:54.370]  There's a link in the show notes and the video description and I do look forward to seeing
[01:54.370 --> 01:57.650]  you in the chat on the discord.
[01:57.650 --> 02:03.150]  Alright before we go too far let me turn down this music a little bit and do a quick update.
[02:03.150 --> 02:07.190]  If you've been listening to the previous episodes you do know that I had a little spider buddy
[02:07.190 --> 02:11.690]  hanging out in my grow space kind of working as a security guard kind of a grow room mascot
[02:11.690 --> 02:15.790]  just in there hanging out with me while I'm working keeping me company listening to podcasts
[02:15.790 --> 02:17.850]  and enjoying some good music with me.
[02:17.850 --> 02:20.830]  Anyway the update is the spider has left the building.
[02:20.830 --> 02:24.870]  I don't know what happened to my little furry arachnid friend but the spider is no longer
[02:24.870 --> 02:25.870]  there.
[02:25.870 --> 02:28.510]  I would see the spider every day sometimes two times a day.
[02:28.510 --> 02:32.990]  I haven't seen the spider in two days which is usually for garden visits.
[02:32.990 --> 02:34.630]  I didn't do anything to the spider.
[02:34.630 --> 02:36.590]  I didn't put out any sticky traps.
[02:36.590 --> 02:37.590]  I didn't apply any pesticides.
[02:37.590 --> 02:39.430]  I didn't put out any predators.
[02:39.430 --> 02:41.990]  I just business as usual in there.
[02:41.990 --> 02:44.910]  Actually I didn't apply a pesticide because that spider was there.
[02:44.910 --> 02:48.850]  I skipped a routine pesticide spray and now the spider is gone.
[02:48.850 --> 02:51.330]  He just casually politely left the building.
[02:51.330 --> 02:52.530]  I don't know if he got bored.
[02:52.530 --> 02:53.730]  I don't know if he ate all the bugs.
[02:53.730 --> 02:57.610]  I don't know if he just wanted to go find some spider ladies to go mate with.
[02:57.610 --> 03:00.530]  I don't know what his plan was but the spider is gone.
[03:00.530 --> 03:03.730]  I got a lot of great feedback about the spider.
[03:03.730 --> 03:06.250]  People told me what kind of spider it was.
[03:06.250 --> 03:08.250]  People told me that it's basically harmless to people.
[03:08.250 --> 03:11.530]  It's not going to cause any damage to my home or my plants.
[03:11.530 --> 03:15.370]  People said that I was doing the right thing by leaving that spider in the grow.
[03:15.370 --> 03:18.770]  By watching that spider grow, he was definitely eating something.
[03:18.770 --> 03:23.250]  I think he was eating fungus gnats or probably fungus gnats is what I think he was eating.
[03:23.250 --> 03:25.850]  That's all I really see in my grow space.
[03:25.850 --> 03:28.750]  Fungus gnats are the only thing that can kind of get away with my grow space.
[03:28.750 --> 03:30.170]  They last in there for a minute.
[03:30.170 --> 03:31.210]  I think he ate most of them.
[03:31.210 --> 03:33.530]  He chewed them up and he has moved on.
[03:33.530 --> 03:36.650]  I don't know if he died and just fell down into a pot.
[03:36.650 --> 03:38.090]  I don't know if I swept him up.
[03:38.090 --> 03:39.730]  I don't know if he's in there just hiding.
[03:39.730 --> 03:41.290]  I don't know if he moved on.
[03:41.290 --> 03:42.290]  He's gone.
[03:42.290 --> 03:43.690]  I got a lot of great feedback is what I was getting at.
[03:43.690 --> 03:45.170]  Somebody asked how he got in there.
[03:45.170 --> 03:46.170]  That is a very good question.
[03:46.170 --> 03:49.290]  I don't know how the spider got in there.
[03:49.290 --> 03:53.090]  It is not a super secure grow space to be completely honest with you.
[03:53.090 --> 03:57.890]  It's more secure from people, children, and pets more than it is from spiders.
[03:57.890 --> 04:02.210]  It is in a home grow so it could have came in through a not completely sealed window
[04:02.210 --> 04:03.210]  area.
[04:03.210 --> 04:05.010]  It could have came in through the door.
[04:05.010 --> 04:06.150]  It's in a home grow.
[04:06.150 --> 04:07.430]  It's in Colorado.
[04:07.430 --> 04:10.010]  Who the fuck knows how that spider got in there.
[04:10.010 --> 04:12.410]  It's not a super, it's not Fort Knox that grow.
[04:12.410 --> 04:14.570]  It's a veg space so it's not Fort Knox.
[04:14.970 --> 04:16.850]  The spider got in and he got out.
[04:16.850 --> 04:17.850]  I don't know if he died.
[04:17.850 --> 04:21.610]  I don't know if he got starved to death because there are no more bugs but he has left the
[04:21.610 --> 04:22.610]  building.
[04:22.610 --> 04:25.010]  Anyway, thanks to everybody for all the feedback about the spider.
[04:25.010 --> 04:28.410]  This is not the Spider-Man podcast so let's move forward a little bit.
[04:28.410 --> 04:29.410]  Wanted to give you an update.
[04:29.410 --> 04:31.850]  Since that music died out it's time to move on.
[04:31.850 --> 04:35.610]  You guys, I ordered, you guys and gals, I have ordered Grow From Your Heart podcast
[04:35.610 --> 04:37.290]  hats.
[04:37.290 --> 04:38.290]  That's right.
[04:38.290 --> 04:42.450]  Grow From Your Heart podcast hats and IRE Genetics hats have been ordered.
[04:42.450 --> 04:45.250]  Just in case you're not familiar, not only am I the host of the Grow From Your Heart
[04:45.250 --> 04:51.170]  podcast, I am the founder, breeder, sole proprietor, sole breeder, the head motherfucker in charge
[04:51.170 --> 04:53.010]  of IRE Genetics premium seeds.
[04:53.010 --> 04:54.410]  That is also me.
[04:54.410 --> 04:59.130]  All of your regular and feminized seeds needs can be handled by IRE Genetics premium seeds.
[04:59.130 --> 05:04.090]  I made Grow From Your Heart podcast hats as well as IRE Genetics hats.
[05:04.090 --> 05:08.130]  If you have been paying attention to the logos, it's the Grow From Your Heart podcast logo
[05:08.130 --> 05:11.610]  with the bars for the graphic equalizer.
[05:11.610 --> 05:13.610]  It's got the red, yellow, and green stripes behind it.
[05:13.610 --> 05:15.650]  It says Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[05:15.650 --> 05:21.010]  I like those hats because people in non-cannabis friendly environments can wear that hat.
[05:21.010 --> 05:22.770]  No one's going to say, is that a weed hat?
[05:22.770 --> 05:25.450]  It just says the Grow From Your Heart podcast on it.
[05:25.450 --> 05:28.130]  It doesn't look like you're on team weed.
[05:28.130 --> 05:29.690]  Anybody can wear that anywhere.
[05:29.690 --> 05:30.770]  No one's going to question you.
[05:30.770 --> 05:35.570]  Then the IRE Genetics premium seeds hat does say IRE Genetics premium seeds on the front.
[05:35.570 --> 05:40.210]  It's got the cross logo, if you're familiar with the Ethiopian cross logo on the front.
[05:40.210 --> 05:42.530]  It says IRE Genetics on the side.
[05:42.530 --> 05:44.130]  Those hats are coming.
[05:44.130 --> 05:45.970]  They will take quite a long time.
[05:45.970 --> 05:47.930]  The ARTMENT has been submitted.
[05:47.930 --> 05:48.930]  Payment has been sent.
[05:48.930 --> 05:51.410]  Now, it is just hurry up and wait.
[05:51.410 --> 05:54.170]  I've got a lot of great merchandise in the works.
[05:54.170 --> 05:58.130]  I've spent a lot of great money, a lot of money on great merchandise.
[05:58.130 --> 06:01.290]  The merch is all being shipped and printed and done.
[06:01.290 --> 06:06.330]  It is a weird time for buying and ordering merchandise in the world right now.
[06:06.330 --> 06:08.090]  Everything is delayed.
[06:08.090 --> 06:11.570]  First off, the manufacturing times are greatly delayed.
[06:11.570 --> 06:15.610]  Then shipping times are even more drastically delayed.
[06:15.610 --> 06:19.570]  Orders are stacking up, which is making the orders that were taken in January of this
[06:19.570 --> 06:21.690]  year are finally getting sent out to people.
[06:21.690 --> 06:26.490]  If you made an order in February, you're weeks behind those January orders because they just
[06:26.490 --> 06:27.490]  got backed up.
[06:27.490 --> 06:28.850]  Anyway, I am rambling.
[06:28.850 --> 06:31.150]  The point is, there's a lot of new merchandise coming.
[06:32.010 --> 06:33.010]  There are two hat designs coming.
[06:33.010 --> 06:35.070]  There's another shirt design being worked on.
[06:35.070 --> 06:36.070]  There are mood mats.
[06:36.070 --> 06:37.150]  They should be here soon.
[06:37.150 --> 06:39.430]  They were supposed to ship mid-October.
[06:39.430 --> 06:42.530]  Here we are, approaching November by the time this episode comes out.
[06:42.530 --> 06:43.790]  No mood mats for the table.
[06:43.790 --> 06:45.350]  No mood mats to show off.
[06:45.350 --> 06:46.350]  They're being printed.
[06:46.350 --> 06:48.370]  They should be here.
[06:48.370 --> 06:49.710]  Be patient, just like I am.
[06:49.710 --> 06:50.950]  You had no idea they were coming.
[06:50.950 --> 06:53.630]  When I get all the stuff, you will get the updates.
[06:53.630 --> 06:57.670]  For updates, go to my website, iRegenetics.com.
[06:57.670 --> 06:58.810]  There's a newsletter tab.
[06:58.810 --> 07:00.110]  Click on the newsletter tab.
[07:00.110 --> 07:01.190]  Type in your email address.
[07:01.190 --> 07:03.670]  When I get new merchandise, I will update you.
[07:03.670 --> 07:07.830]  Not only will I update you on merchandise, but new seed drops, new strains, updates,
[07:07.830 --> 07:09.990]  events, and things like that.
[07:09.990 --> 07:14.350]  Speaking of events, this is a great way to segue into my next note on my list.
[07:14.350 --> 07:18.910]  There is an event known as the Kind Cup Virginia coming up at the start of November.
[07:18.910 --> 07:23.430]  Make sure you attend the Kind Cup November if the Kind Cup Virginia in November.
[07:23.430 --> 07:24.430]  I'm not even going to edit that.
[07:24.430 --> 07:26.990]  You can see my brain totally skip right there.
[07:26.990 --> 07:29.590]  Kind Cup Virginia in November.
[07:29.590 --> 07:31.870]  That's a tongue twister if you're as stoned as me.
[07:31.870 --> 07:32.870]  Check that out.
[07:32.870 --> 07:38.990]  If you are a Virginia cannabis consumer, advocate, consumptionist, enthusiast, anything involving
[07:38.990 --> 07:45.030]  cannabis in November in Virginia, the first weekend you want to go check out this event.
[07:45.030 --> 07:48.590]  Check out the Kind Cup VA on Instagram.
[07:48.590 --> 07:49.590]  Check out the website.
[07:49.590 --> 07:51.670]  Just Google the Kind Cup VA.
[07:51.670 --> 07:53.790]  All the information you need will pop right up.
[07:53.790 --> 07:59.350]  There will be a vendor there with iRegenetics premium seeds.
[08:00.110 --> 08:04.550]  Let's try to get me back on track after a total brain fart in the middle of that last note.
[08:04.550 --> 08:06.430]  Let's jump into this email here.
[08:06.430 --> 08:07.430]  I do have an email.
[08:07.430 --> 08:09.950]  It is a breeding question about calling mails.
[08:09.950 --> 08:10.950]  Let's get right into it.
[08:10.950 --> 08:14.670]  It says, hey, Ross to Jeff, thank you for taking the time to read my email.
[08:14.670 --> 08:18.350]  Hey, thank you for taking the time to send me a great email and thank you for listening
[08:18.350 --> 08:19.550]  to the show.
[08:19.550 --> 08:23.990]  It says, first, thank you for all of the valuable information you provide to the community.
[08:23.990 --> 08:25.550]  Bro, thank you for noticing.
[08:25.550 --> 08:26.910]  I do appreciate that.
[08:27.070 --> 08:32.070]  It says, I've been a listener for many a year, long before the video show, which is amazing.
[08:32.070 --> 08:37.870]  I'm also a DGC supporter and I will be joining the IRE army soon.
[08:37.870 --> 08:39.550]  You've been listening for a long time.
[08:39.550 --> 08:40.550]  Thank you.
[08:40.550 --> 08:42.670]  This show is not always been a video podcast.
[08:42.670 --> 08:47.430]  If you're new, a lot of the old episodes are just a picture on a screen and me rambling.
[08:47.430 --> 08:53.790]  This is only recently around episode 580 something, I think 500 and something became a video show.
[08:53.790 --> 08:57.070]  It's almost a hundred video shows when I say that out loud, but it wasn't always a
[08:57.070 --> 08:58.070]  video show.
[08:58.070 --> 09:01.750]  So thank you for being there from the beginning when we were just doing, when I was just doing
[09:01.750 --> 09:06.350]  an audio show, trying to figure out my goal, trying to figure out my whole idea of what
[09:06.350 --> 09:07.770]  the podcast was.
[09:07.770 --> 09:09.230]  Thank you for being there for such a long time.
[09:09.230 --> 09:12.150]  I do appreciate that and big up to the DGC.
[09:12.150 --> 09:14.230]  Shout out to the Dude Grow Show.
[09:14.230 --> 09:18.470]  Without the Dude Grow Show, the Dude Grows crew, this podcast probably wouldn't exist.
[09:18.470 --> 09:19.550]  They inspired me a little bit.
[09:19.550 --> 09:20.830]  They taught me a little bit.
[09:20.830 --> 09:25.550]  I've been on their show that definitely advertises for me and gives me a springboard.
[09:25.550 --> 09:27.870]  And they're also some of my favorite friends.
[09:27.870 --> 09:31.350]  Big up to Scotty Real, big up to the Dude, big up to Guru.
[09:31.350 --> 09:34.830]  Shout out to the whole gang, everybody behind the scenes that doesn't get the love.
[09:34.830 --> 09:35.830]  What's up guys?
[09:35.830 --> 09:36.830]  I'm a podcast producer.
[09:36.830 --> 09:38.690]  I understand how much work you're putting in.
[09:38.690 --> 09:40.310]  Great show, great work, great efforts.
[09:40.310 --> 09:42.950]  You guys go follow the DGC if you're not already.
[09:42.950 --> 09:44.990]  That's enough advertising for another show.
[09:44.990 --> 09:46.070]  Let's keep it moving.
[09:46.070 --> 09:47.070]  It goes on.
[09:47.070 --> 09:48.390]  Oh, I will be joining the Ivory Army soon.
[09:48.390 --> 09:50.150]  No pressure, my friend.
[09:50.150 --> 09:51.190]  Money is tight these days.
[09:51.190 --> 09:52.190]  Money is expensive.
[09:52.190 --> 09:53.190]  I get it.
[09:53.190 --> 09:54.190]  No pressure.
[09:54.190 --> 09:55.910]  A lot of people are supporting the Patreon.
[09:55.910 --> 09:57.490]  I appreciate it.
[09:57.490 --> 09:58.730]  Join in when you can.
[09:58.730 --> 09:59.730]  It goes on.
[09:59.730 --> 10:03.710]  It says, for my question, I feel like you would be a great help and offer the insight
[10:03.710 --> 10:05.970]  which I cannot find online.
[10:05.970 --> 10:08.310]  Thank you in advance for your expert help.
[10:08.310 --> 10:09.310]  I like that.
[10:09.310 --> 10:13.790]  I like that you come to me instead of going to the internet because I've said it before,
[10:13.790 --> 10:16.970]  the internet can be so full of shit.
[10:16.970 --> 10:22.250]  The internet is a great place for some information, but there's no security guard or gatekeeper
[10:22.250 --> 10:23.250]  at the internet.
[10:23.250 --> 10:28.090]  If I wanted to, I could type an article on the internet that said I made $9 million last
[10:28.090 --> 10:32.650]  week and that I've got the most prolific seed company and the number one podcast on the
[10:32.650 --> 10:37.970]  planet and that I can bench press fucking 600 pounds and fucking I could type whatever
[10:37.970 --> 10:41.430]  I want on the internet and people will read it and a lot of people will think it's true
[10:41.430 --> 10:43.970]  and nobody will fact check it and it will become fact.
[10:43.970 --> 10:45.370]  That will become story.
[10:45.690 --> 10:48.610]  That will be the truth that always lives on forever because that's the internet.
[10:48.610 --> 10:52.810]  Anybody could type anything which is great and fun, but it's very problematic because
[10:52.810 --> 10:56.970]  I see a lot of people typing a lot of things that will cause more problems in the growth
[10:56.970 --> 10:58.890]  than they will possibly solve.
[10:58.890 --> 11:01.450]  The internet's great, but the internet can also be a problem.
[11:01.450 --> 11:05.450]  I appreciate that you came straight to me and you're like, hey, the internet is crazy,
[11:05.450 --> 11:06.450]  dude.
[11:06.450 --> 11:07.650]  Here is a person that may know.
[11:07.650 --> 11:08.650]  Maybe I'll ask them.
[11:08.650 --> 11:09.810]  I appreciate that.
[11:09.810 --> 11:12.450]  Let me get my high rambling ass back on track.
[11:12.450 --> 11:16.370]  I do think that I've got the insight and then you said thank you for the expert advice.
[11:16.370 --> 11:19.490]  I don't know about an expert, just an idiot with a lot of experience.
[11:19.490 --> 11:21.410]  I've done this a lot, take a lot of notes.
[11:21.410 --> 11:22.930]  I'm passionately curious.
[11:22.930 --> 11:26.970]  I feel like these plants and I just get along so much.
[11:26.970 --> 11:28.330]  It just feels natural to me.
[11:28.330 --> 11:31.850]  It's just like I know when I walk into the growth, I'm like, oh, it's too humid in there.
[11:31.850 --> 11:32.850]  I could just feel it.
[11:32.850 --> 11:34.770]  I'm like my own humidity gauge, humidistat.
[11:34.770 --> 11:36.810]  Anyway, hygrometer, that's what the word is.
[11:36.810 --> 11:38.650]  I told you guys I'm high and rambly today.
[11:38.650 --> 11:41.450]  It's fun when you get on a microphone and just feel comfortable.
[11:41.450 --> 11:42.450]  It goes on.
[11:42.450 --> 11:44.330]  It does say, here's the actual question of the podcast.
[11:44.330 --> 11:47.450]  I'm running a pheno hunt consisting of five strains.
[11:47.450 --> 11:52.290]  My goal is to find a potential candidate as a keeper plus a breeding male.
[11:52.290 --> 11:54.370]  All right, I do like that.
[11:54.370 --> 11:56.210]  You're going to do a pheno hunt.
[11:56.210 --> 12:02.170]  Your goal is to find breeding plants, a breeding keeper and a breeding male.
[12:02.170 --> 12:03.930]  That is a great idea.
[12:03.930 --> 12:06.230]  However, grow them out a lot.
[12:06.230 --> 12:08.450]  This one time isn't enough.
[12:08.450 --> 12:09.530]  Do your pheno hunt.
[12:09.530 --> 12:16.010]  Find the plants that you like as a grower, as a consumer, not as a breeder yet.
[12:16.010 --> 12:18.490]  Find the plants that you like just as a grower.
[12:18.490 --> 12:22.970]  Find the plants that stand out as a grower and those should be your stellar breeding
[12:22.970 --> 12:23.970]  plants.
[12:23.970 --> 12:30.010]  But running them once for a pheno hunt, in my opinion, is not enough to select a winner
[12:30.010 --> 12:32.250]  for a breeding program.
[12:32.250 --> 12:34.170]  It is only one date.
[12:34.170 --> 12:39.210]  Nobody can hide their flaws, their crazy, their issues for one date.
[12:39.210 --> 12:42.930]  It's going to take two or three dates to find out the problem of these plants.
[12:42.930 --> 12:44.010]  You need to stress them.
[12:44.010 --> 12:46.090]  The first grow, do it correctly.
[12:46.090 --> 12:49.890]  Do it perfectly so you can find out what do these plants express?
[12:49.890 --> 12:52.730]  What do they look like without stressful conditions?
[12:52.730 --> 12:56.690]  Maybe some of those plants will show you intersex traits, maybe some mutants, maybe undesirable
[12:56.690 --> 12:59.270]  growth traits that you're not looking for.
[12:59.270 --> 13:00.490]  Run them one time.
[13:00.490 --> 13:02.650]  The second time, change some things up.
[13:02.650 --> 13:04.290]  Push the nutrients a little harder.
[13:04.290 --> 13:05.530]  Push the lights a little harder.
[13:05.530 --> 13:10.130]  Do something different to almost induce a little bit of stress to these plants.
[13:10.130 --> 13:11.850]  Then you'll see some intersex plants.
[13:11.850 --> 13:12.850]  You'll see some mutants.
[13:12.850 --> 13:14.730]  You'll see shit you don't like at this point.
[13:14.730 --> 13:17.210]  Then the third time, really mess with them.
[13:17.210 --> 13:18.450]  Mess up that light cycle.
[13:18.450 --> 13:19.450]  Mess up their feeding.
[13:19.450 --> 13:21.430]  Give them drastic temperature swings.
[13:21.430 --> 13:27.010]  See if these plants show you intersex traits, intersex problems, growth problems, any traits
[13:27.010 --> 13:28.330]  that you don't like.
[13:28.330 --> 13:30.190]  You should have a goal when you are breeding.
[13:30.190 --> 13:32.230]  You should know what kind of plants you like.
[13:32.230 --> 13:37.110]  Do these plants within those three runs, do you see shit that you do not like?
[13:37.110 --> 13:40.510]  Part of breeding, it's really easy to find what you do like.
[13:40.510 --> 13:42.570]  How do you notice what you do not like?
[13:42.570 --> 13:44.950]  What do you not accept into your breeding program?
[13:44.950 --> 13:46.070]  Look for that.
[13:46.070 --> 13:51.350]  I love the idea of doing a pheno hunt to find plants for breeding, but let's run them a
[13:51.350 --> 13:54.110]  couple of times and build a relationship with them.
[13:54.110 --> 13:58.790]  Like I said, I compare it to dating people.
[13:58.790 --> 14:03.750]  You can hide your crazy, your insecurity, your fucking psycho, your problems, your issues
[14:03.750 --> 14:06.790]  for a couple of dates, but by the third or fourth date, the bullshit's going to start
[14:06.790 --> 14:07.790]  coming through.
[14:07.790 --> 14:08.790]  You're going to be late.
[14:08.790 --> 14:10.670]  You're going to fucking complain about everything.
[14:10.670 --> 14:14.790]  Whatever issues red flags are to you, you'll find those, but it may not pop up on that
[14:14.790 --> 14:19.830]  first run with these plants, just like you may not see the crazy on a first date.
[14:19.830 --> 14:22.270]  Run them a couple of times before you breed to them.
[14:22.270 --> 14:23.350]  That is just my advice.
[14:23.350 --> 14:24.350]  Do it your way.
[14:24.350 --> 14:25.350]  Have fun.
[14:25.350 --> 14:26.350]  Grow from your heart.
[14:26.350 --> 14:27.350]  Breed with love.
[14:27.350 --> 14:28.350]  Fuck the rules.
[14:28.910 --> 14:32.310]  The only way to do this for better success is to grow the females at least a couple of
[14:32.310 --> 14:36.550]  times, grow the male at least once or twice, almost all the way through with the male and
[14:36.550 --> 14:37.990]  see what you've got.
[14:37.990 --> 14:41.150]  Test them, stress test them, abuse them.
[14:41.150 --> 14:42.910]  Don't do the abusive part to your date.
[14:42.910 --> 14:44.750]  That is the part where we've got to draw the line.
[14:44.750 --> 14:46.030]  The date will show you the problems.
[14:46.030 --> 14:47.230]  The people will show you the problems.
[14:47.230 --> 14:48.230]  Don't abuse them.
[14:48.230 --> 14:50.630]  You do your thing, but do abuse the plants.
[14:50.630 --> 14:51.750]  Stress test these plants.
[14:51.750 --> 14:53.230]  People are getting stress tested by life.
[14:53.230 --> 14:54.630]  They'll show you their problems.
[14:54.630 --> 14:58.990]  You've got to throw some fucking accounting issues and some baby daddy drama at the plants
[14:58.990 --> 15:01.070]  also and see how they handle some shit.
[15:01.070 --> 15:02.070]  All right.
[15:02.070 --> 15:04.790]  It says I have flipped to flower and I am on day nine now.
[15:04.790 --> 15:08.830]  I've cloned everything and I've separated the males and the females.
[15:08.830 --> 15:14.590]  My main question here is when do I start culling males that you deem unworthy?
[15:14.590 --> 15:15.950]  That's a very good question.
[15:15.950 --> 15:21.030]  It says I plan on taking all of the males 50 plus days to flower to see their full expression.
[15:21.030 --> 15:25.830]  Would it be more logical to cull along the way or at the end or stay the path and see
[15:25.830 --> 15:28.990]  their final forms then decide and cull all?
[15:28.990 --> 15:33.670]  Now I'm going to go back to my maybe not the best analogy, but I'm going to go back to
[15:33.670 --> 15:37.990]  my dating analogy and if you can see that a male plant is not going to reach your goal
[15:37.990 --> 15:41.070]  in your breeding program, you don't have to keep it around.
[15:41.070 --> 15:44.790]  If you're looking for tall, skinny plants and you've got a short squatty plant, why
[15:44.790 --> 15:46.310]  would you even keep the short squat one?
[15:46.310 --> 15:48.230]  You want the tall skinny one.
[15:48.230 --> 15:51.150]  If you want a short squatty one, get rid of the tall stretchy ones.
[15:51.150 --> 15:54.790]  If it's not fitting the criteria which you're looking for, get it out of there.
[15:54.790 --> 15:55.790]  Why waste time with it?
[15:55.790 --> 15:59.150]  You don't have to go on a second date with a plant that you already know is crazy on
[15:59.150 --> 16:02.030]  the first date.
[16:02.030 --> 16:04.630]  You can cull them as you're going.
[16:04.630 --> 16:06.190]  You can cull them in veg.
[16:06.190 --> 16:07.190]  They're your plants.
[16:07.190 --> 16:08.430]  They're just plants.
[16:08.430 --> 16:09.910]  It's very okay to cull plants.
[16:09.910 --> 16:11.250]  You can just get rid of them.
[16:11.250 --> 16:15.110]  Don't waste the time, the soil, the water, the lights, the energy, the numbers.
[16:15.110 --> 16:17.870]  In my situation, plant counts are very important.
[16:18.510 --> 16:21.590]  If I see one that I'm like, oh, I don't like that clip, let's replace it with something
[16:21.590 --> 16:24.670]  that is good because I can only have so many.
[16:24.670 --> 16:28.590]  I would start culling as soon as you start seeing that those plants don't reach your
[16:28.590 --> 16:30.190]  criteria.
[16:30.190 --> 16:33.210]  To do that, you've got to have a solid goal.
[16:33.210 --> 16:34.670]  What is your goal?
[16:34.670 --> 16:38.650]  You've got a bunch of new female plants and you've got a new male plant.
[16:38.650 --> 16:41.430]  You've got to establish a goal before you get much further.
[16:41.430 --> 16:44.110]  What do you want the male plant to look like?
[16:44.110 --> 16:46.570]  Why are you breeding with those selected female plants?
[16:46.570 --> 16:48.090]  What are you trying to do?
[16:48.090 --> 16:50.170]  Why do those plants stand out to you to breed?
[16:50.170 --> 16:51.970]  What do you want from your male plant?
[16:51.970 --> 16:53.930]  Write all that criteria down.
[16:53.930 --> 16:54.930]  Maybe make a checklist.
[16:54.930 --> 16:58.610]  I want my male plant to be shaped like this, leaves like this.
[16:58.610 --> 16:59.970]  I want it to smell like this.
[16:59.970 --> 17:01.970]  I want it to flower around this many weeks.
[17:01.970 --> 17:05.610]  I want to just write down a checklist of what you're looking for and if it doesn't have
[17:05.610 --> 17:06.610]  that, get rid of it.
[17:06.610 --> 17:10.370]  It's very easy to pull plants that don't reach your criteria.
[17:10.370 --> 17:13.090]  As a breeder, seeing what you like is really easy.
[17:13.090 --> 17:14.250]  I said this a moment ago.
[17:14.250 --> 17:18.750]  Seeing what you like is really easy, but then also identifying the red flags or traits
[17:18.750 --> 17:22.810]  that you don't like is another special skill that you have to acquire as a breeder.
[17:22.810 --> 17:25.850]  Then there's another thing of becoming attached to the plants.
[17:25.850 --> 17:26.850]  We love these plants.
[17:26.850 --> 17:28.170]  We've spent weeks on them.
[17:28.170 --> 17:29.490]  We know that it's got potential.
[17:29.490 --> 17:32.530]  Even though that's not the breeder for this run, I should save that male and use it for
[17:32.530 --> 17:35.210]  the next run because it would work well.
[17:35.210 --> 17:36.690]  Just get rid of some shit sometimes.
[17:36.690 --> 17:38.130]  Pick the best of the best.
[17:38.130 --> 17:39.970]  We're breeding cannabis.
[17:39.970 --> 17:42.210]  There are so many people out there breeding.
[17:42.210 --> 17:43.490]  There's so many plants out there.
[17:43.730 --> 17:45.410]  There's so many seeds out there.
[17:45.410 --> 17:49.370]  Why would you waste time with something that kind of shows potential when you could fuck
[17:49.370 --> 17:53.210]  with something that, look at this rock star that is just ready to go.
[17:53.210 --> 17:55.490]  Don't waste time with sixes and sevens in the grow space.
[17:55.490 --> 17:57.650]  We only have room for nines and tens.
[17:57.650 --> 17:59.650]  I'm trying to get cannabis to an 11.
[17:59.650 --> 18:01.770]  So quit fucking with the fives and sixes.
[18:01.770 --> 18:04.050]  I said fives is not even going to edit that.
[18:04.050 --> 18:05.170]  Quit fucking with the fives.
[18:05.170 --> 18:06.210]  Quit fucking with the sixes.
[18:06.210 --> 18:07.450]  Get them out early.
[18:07.450 --> 18:10.650]  If you know that's not reaching your criteria, don't use it.
[18:10.690 --> 18:14.890]  I don't like to use a male plant that's a freaky mutant in a breeding program that has
[18:14.890 --> 18:16.930]  potential to go to market.
[18:16.930 --> 18:21.130]  If it is something for my personal experimental stuff to keep back that you guys will never
[18:21.130 --> 18:26.450]  see other than pictures and I may outcross it later, then I may use a freaky mutant just
[18:26.450 --> 18:28.570]  for my own personal breeding program.
[18:28.570 --> 18:32.530]  But I've been doing it for long enough that I can see what I want out of that.
[18:32.530 --> 18:36.850]  But for a commercial, for a production breeding program, I wouldn't even fuck with the mutant.
[18:36.850 --> 18:38.770]  Something slow growing, something shitty.
[18:38.770 --> 18:40.490]  It goes immediately.
[18:40.490 --> 18:43.970]  I need highly productive plants with vigor.
[18:43.970 --> 18:45.530]  They recover from stress very well.
[18:45.530 --> 18:49.170]  They can handle abuse that are resistant to bugs, resistant to mildew.
[18:49.170 --> 18:51.210]  Find those sort of traits.
[18:51.210 --> 18:55.010]  And I say this a lot, set yourself up for success.
[18:55.010 --> 18:57.730]  Don't fuck with those number five males or females.
[18:57.730 --> 18:58.850]  Get them out of the grow.
[18:58.850 --> 18:59.850]  Get rid of them.
[18:59.850 --> 19:04.450]  Then when you've narrowed it down to one or two solid males, flower that one out all the
[19:04.450 --> 19:05.450]  way.
[19:05.450 --> 19:07.690]  Let it go 60 or 70 days and see what it does.
[19:07.690 --> 19:08.850]  Does it change colors on you?
[19:08.850 --> 19:09.850]  Does it make trichomes?
[19:10.210 --> 19:13.530]  Do those trichomes build up on one part of the plant or another?
[19:13.530 --> 19:15.130]  Like what do you see when it goes longer?
[19:15.130 --> 19:16.130]  Does it get deficiencies?
[19:16.130 --> 19:18.250]  Does it start bulking up at the end?
[19:18.250 --> 19:20.710]  Those traits are going to pass over in the progeny.
[19:20.710 --> 19:21.730]  So let it go.
[19:21.730 --> 19:22.990]  See what you've got.
[19:22.990 --> 19:26.890]  Maybe narrow it down to one or two and then let those last two go like 70 days and see
[19:26.890 --> 19:29.150]  what's the best out of those.
[19:29.150 --> 19:30.570]  Something will speak to you.
[19:30.570 --> 19:33.330]  In most cases, something will speak to you.
[19:33.330 --> 19:38.250]  And you're not wrong because it's like choosing, I don't know, it's like choosing cake or ice
[19:38.250 --> 19:39.250]  cream.
[19:39.650 --> 19:40.650]  It's delicious.
[19:40.650 --> 19:41.650]  And if you choose cake, you get to eat cake.
[19:41.650 --> 19:43.610]  And if you choose ice cream, you get to eat ice cream.
[19:43.610 --> 19:44.610]  You didn't fucking lose.
[19:44.610 --> 19:45.610]  You're going to have a good time.
[19:45.610 --> 19:46.850]  You get to grow out a bunch of seeds.
[19:46.850 --> 19:47.850]  You get to make a project.
[19:47.850 --> 19:50.410]  You get to see what it does.
[19:50.410 --> 19:53.810]  Maybe maybe you did choose the wrong cake or ice cream when the outcome grows and some
[19:53.810 --> 19:55.370]  of that stuff grows like shit.
[19:55.370 --> 19:57.370]  But this wasn't a life or death situation.
[19:57.370 --> 19:58.890]  This was a fun breeding project.
[19:58.890 --> 19:59.890]  And guess what?
[19:59.890 --> 20:01.970]  Get to eat more cake and ice cream and try it again.
[20:01.970 --> 20:03.610]  So have fun with it.
[20:03.610 --> 20:04.610]  Grow from your heart.
[20:04.610 --> 20:05.610]  Breed with love.
[20:05.610 --> 20:07.170]  Set yourself up for success.
[20:07.170 --> 20:10.250]  Pull those ugly males whenever you feel it is time to get rid of them.
[20:10.250 --> 20:11.690]  There's no need to keep them around.
[20:11.690 --> 20:17.130]  Like I said, time, space, energy, lights, water, soil, real estate, all of that stuff
[20:17.130 --> 20:18.770]  adds up very quickly.
[20:18.770 --> 20:22.490]  If it's a male plant that doesn't reach your criteria, if it's a female plant that doesn't
[20:22.490 --> 20:24.650]  reach your criteria, get rid of it.
[20:24.650 --> 20:28.210]  Use that space for something that is going to pay for itself.
[20:28.210 --> 20:31.890]  It's got to, it's getting rent in your grow room for free.
[20:31.890 --> 20:32.890]  Let me keep going.
[20:32.890 --> 20:34.290]  There is more to this.
[20:34.290 --> 20:38.130]  It says, I've been taking detailed notes along the way and I have my plans mapped out for
[20:38.130 --> 20:40.490]  what my potential outcome will be.
[20:40.490 --> 20:43.670]  I expect so many surprises in your first breeding program.
[20:43.670 --> 20:47.050]  It's going to be fun, especially doing it from straight up seeds.
[20:47.050 --> 20:48.290]  Going to be so many variables.
[20:48.290 --> 20:52.530]  It says, I've been growing a very long time, but I've never ventured into breeding until
[20:52.530 --> 20:53.530]  now.
[20:53.530 --> 20:58.210]  My next hunt will be the machine from yourself to look for a male as well.
[20:58.210 --> 20:59.770]  Once we get it into Canada.
[20:59.770 --> 21:02.190]  Ooh, everybody is hyped up on the machine.
[21:02.190 --> 21:06.750]  The machine will make it to Canada as soon as we do the official drop here in the States.
[21:06.750 --> 21:09.310]  The official drop will happen in Canada as well.
[21:09.310 --> 21:12.190]  I'll make sure to get packs up to my Canadian distributor.
[21:12.190 --> 21:14.470]  The link for the Canadian distributor is on the website.
[21:14.470 --> 21:19.750]  If you're up there in Canada looking for IRI seeds, go to irigenetics.com, click on seed
[21:19.750 --> 21:20.750]  vendors.
[21:20.750 --> 21:22.330]  There's one that simply says Canada.
[21:22.330 --> 21:23.990]  That is for you, my friends up there in Canada.
[21:23.990 --> 21:24.990]  Click on that.
[21:24.990 --> 21:26.710]  Right now, the stock is low.
[21:26.710 --> 21:28.250]  They are being replenished.
[21:28.250 --> 21:30.390]  It takes a lot of time to get shit to Canada.
[21:30.390 --> 21:31.390]  That's all I can really say.
[21:31.390 --> 21:33.950]  It takes a minute to get it up there.
[21:33.950 --> 21:37.430]  The machine will make it to Canada along with the Saka Souffle.
[21:37.430 --> 21:38.830]  Big shout out to my buddy, Mobius.
[21:38.830 --> 21:43.630]  Big shout out to Rosinman, and once again, for doing beautiful jobs with the test grows
[21:43.630 --> 21:45.750]  on the Saka Souffle and the machine.
[21:45.750 --> 21:48.490]  Those guys are a badass team out there working together.
[21:48.490 --> 21:52.670]  Good friends, good bros, good friends of mine, big members of the IRI army.
[21:52.670 --> 21:53.830]  The machine is coming to Canada.
[21:53.830 --> 21:54.830]  It will be everywhere.
[21:54.830 --> 21:55.830]  Don't worry.
[21:55.830 --> 21:58.150]  I'm working on more distribution as well.
[21:58.510 --> 22:01.750]  Also, you guys keep asking about the machine and the Saka Souffle.
[22:01.750 --> 22:05.430]  I will do full complete episodes for those strains.
[22:05.430 --> 22:06.430]  Have no fear.
[22:06.430 --> 22:08.390]  I cannot wait to talk about them.
[22:08.390 --> 22:12.110]  When I've got a better plan of a drop date, I will talk about it.
[22:12.110 --> 22:13.990]  I was planning on dropping them at the Indo Expo.
[22:13.990 --> 22:15.150]  I've said this before.
[22:15.150 --> 22:17.390]  I don't know if the Indo Expo is even happening.
[22:17.390 --> 22:22.430]  All of the emails I send to the Indo Expo come back with a notice that say, this email
[22:22.430 --> 22:26.470]  is no longer being monitored and all of the employees have been terminated.
[22:26.470 --> 22:27.790]  That's the fucking fate of the Indo Expo.
[22:27.950 --> 22:29.950]  I do not think it's going to happen.
[22:29.950 --> 22:31.550]  I apologize if you had plans.
[22:31.550 --> 22:33.790]  There was a big event happening around that.
[22:33.790 --> 22:35.350]  You guys, I don't think that's going to happen.
[22:35.350 --> 22:36.910]  Let's re-plan that.
[22:36.910 --> 22:37.910]  We'll talk.
[22:37.910 --> 22:40.790]  But the release was supposed to happen at the Indo Expo.
[22:40.790 --> 22:43.470]  If that may not happen, there's no need to wait on dropping these beans.
[22:43.470 --> 22:44.550]  I've got them.
[22:44.550 --> 22:46.350]  I'm working on art.
[22:46.350 --> 22:50.430]  My art friend is probably designing the art packaging, the packaging for the art, the
[22:50.430 --> 22:52.870]  art for the packaging, whatever the fuck I'm trying to say.
[22:52.870 --> 22:53.870]  Big shout out to my art buddy.
[22:53.870 --> 22:56.390]  He's probably up right now smoking dabs doing the artwork.
[22:56.990 --> 23:00.550]  Once we get the art finalized, the packaging in my hands, seeds and packages, then we'll
[23:00.550 --> 23:07.070]  discuss doing a podcast episode and getting those seeds out to the vendors, then to you.
[23:07.070 --> 23:08.070]  Stay tuned for the machine.
[23:08.070 --> 23:09.070]  Let's see.
[23:09.070 --> 23:10.070]  There's more to this.
[23:10.070 --> 23:11.750]  It says, thank you.
[23:11.750 --> 23:12.750]  That's it.
[23:12.750 --> 23:14.890]  Thank you for everything you do and keep up the great work.
[23:14.890 --> 23:16.310]  You are a true artist.
[23:16.310 --> 23:20.630]  Then, just really quickly since we read this, there is a quick rundown of the strains we
[23:20.630 --> 23:21.630]  are hunting.
[23:21.630 --> 23:22.870]  I want to know which one is going to be the male.
[23:23.350 --> 23:26.710]  It says you're hunting five, maybe one of these five strains.
[23:26.710 --> 23:29.710]  My goal of this is to find a potential candidate plus a breeding male.
[23:29.710 --> 23:30.710]  All right.
[23:30.710 --> 23:33.070]  So out of this, these are the five strains you're going to grow.
[23:33.070 --> 23:34.630]  One of these we're looking for a male.
[23:34.630 --> 23:38.070]  We have got Amnesia 2 Zombie Kush from Ripper.
[23:38.070 --> 23:41.310]  We've got Lake Tahoe OG from Best Coast Genetics.
[23:41.310 --> 23:43.710]  We got Skunkberry from Jordan of the Islands.
[23:43.710 --> 23:48.870]  We got God's White Banana from Jordan of the Islands and Black Candy from Jordan of the
[23:48.870 --> 23:49.870]  Islands.
[23:49.870 --> 23:50.870]  It sounds like a great lineup.
[23:50.870 --> 23:56.830]  Unfortunately, I'm not familiar enough with any of these lines or breeders to make a recommendation
[23:56.830 --> 23:58.270]  on what to look for.
[23:58.270 --> 24:01.070]  So it sounds like a great lineup.
[24:01.070 --> 24:02.110]  Sounds like fun.
[24:02.110 --> 24:03.270]  And I wish you the best of luck.
[24:03.270 --> 24:04.270]  Send me some pictures.
[24:04.270 --> 24:08.750]  If it comes down to selecting male plants and you're not sure what to do, send me some
[24:08.750 --> 24:09.750]  photos.
[24:09.750 --> 24:13.070]  We'll put the pictures on the podcast here and then we'll talk about selecting the male
[24:13.070 --> 24:15.230]  from your seed stock.
[24:15.230 --> 24:16.230]  All right.
[24:16.230 --> 24:20.390]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[24:20.390 --> 24:24.630]  cutters and pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there, I want to
[24:24.630 --> 24:29.750]  thank you once again for listening to episode 684 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[24:29.750 --> 24:31.510]  My voice is starting to cut out and crackle.
[24:31.510 --> 24:34.870]  I don't want to torture you and make you listen to a terrible sounding show.
[24:34.870 --> 24:36.910]  So I'm going to quit while I'm still winning.
[24:36.910 --> 24:37.910]  I want to thank you again.
[24:37.910 --> 24:42.150]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments or concerns, the email address is growfromyourheart
[24:42.150 --> 24:43.150]  at hotmail.com.
[24:43.150 --> 24:44.670]  Don't be shy.

[24:48.790 --> 24:50.470]  All of the links you need are right there.

[25:00.950 --> 25:02.870]  That is all I've got for you for this episode.
[25:02.870 --> 25:05.150]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[25:05.150 --> 25:08.990]  I want to give a big shout out to my buddy OG Purple Thumb.
[25:08.990 --> 25:12.350]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
