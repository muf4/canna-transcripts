[00:00.000 --> 00:02.360]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.360 --> 00:06.080]  It's time for Episode 372 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.080 --> 00:09.000]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:09.000 --> 00:13.520]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[00:13.520 --> 00:19.080]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:19.080 --> 00:22.720]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[00:22.720 --> 00:27.880]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Banana OG Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[00:27.880 --> 00:35.840]  On the label, it says it is 83.2% THC and a total of 97% total cannabinoids.
[00:35.840 --> 00:37.400]  I really enjoyed the Banana OG.
[00:37.400 --> 00:40.960]  It is kind of a change from what I usually buy.
[00:40.960 --> 00:45.320]  I usually like a concentrate that makes my head spin, makes my eyes vibrate, makes it
[00:45.320 --> 00:46.600]  hard to think.
[00:46.600 --> 00:49.000]  The Banana OG is kind of more of a mellow thing.
[00:49.000 --> 00:50.320]  It's got me kind of chilled out.
[00:50.320 --> 00:51.320]  It's kind of slow motion.
[00:51.320 --> 00:52.640]  It's got my eyes nice and heavy.
[00:52.640 --> 00:54.800]  It's got my shoulders nice and chilled out.
[00:54.800 --> 00:58.720]  I really dig the flavor of the Banana OG.
[00:58.720 --> 00:59.960]  So that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[00:59.960 --> 01:02.280]  I hope you guys are taking dabs of something delicious.
[01:02.280 --> 01:05.480]  I'm not sure if you can tell, but I still have a little bit of that head cold hanging
[01:05.480 --> 01:06.480]  around.
[01:06.480 --> 01:07.480]  I'm trying to get rid of that.
[01:07.480 --> 01:08.760]  I'm not going to let it slow me down.
[01:08.760 --> 01:12.040]  I am going to deliver a quality podcast.
[01:12.040 --> 01:14.980]  In this episode, I plan to bring you another grow lesson.
[01:14.980 --> 01:18.600]  Before we get to the grow lesson, I've got a couple of quick things to cover.
[01:18.600 --> 01:20.400]  I am working on the website.
[01:20.400 --> 01:22.400]  Of course, I am iRegenetics Colorado.
[01:22.400 --> 01:25.720]  My website is iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[01:25.720 --> 01:27.800]  We are currently doing some updates.
[01:27.800 --> 01:32.120]  During the process of updating the website, something went completely freaking wrong and
[01:32.120 --> 01:35.600]  the podcast does not work from the website anymore.
[01:35.600 --> 01:39.040]  All of the episodes that were up before the update are still accessible.
[01:39.040 --> 01:42.860]  None of the new things I add to the website are posting to the RSS feed.
[01:42.860 --> 01:44.680]  My web guy is working on it.
[01:44.680 --> 01:48.200]  It is the holiday weekend, so he has taken a few days off, but I'm sure he will get back
[01:48.200 --> 01:50.360]  on it as soon as the weekend is over.
[01:50.360 --> 01:54.880]  My point is, I know the website is messed up and I apologize for not having the episodes
[01:54.880 --> 01:58.240]  out on iTunes and Stitcher as regularly scheduled.
[01:58.240 --> 02:02.440]  I was just recently bragging about not missing a Monday in five years.
[02:02.440 --> 02:03.440]  Here I am.
[02:03.440 --> 02:04.480]  I've missed at least one Monday.
[02:04.480 --> 02:07.320]  It looks like I may potentially miss two Mondays in a row.
[02:07.320 --> 02:08.720]  I do apologize.
[02:08.720 --> 02:12.880]  However, the episodes are recorded and the shows are posted on YouTube.
[02:12.880 --> 02:14.160]  I have not stopped recording.
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.120]  I haven't stopped doing the shows.
[02:16.120 --> 02:21.360]  I'm just unable to post them to iTunes and Stitcher because of a glitch with my website.
[02:21.360 --> 02:24.240]  Please be patient with me and please keep listening to the show.
[02:24.240 --> 02:27.820]  Please find the show on YouTube if that is your only option of listening for the next
[02:27.820 --> 02:28.820]  couple of weeks.
[02:28.820 --> 02:32.440]  Also, real quick, I want to give a shout out to the guy who works on the website for me.
[02:32.440 --> 02:35.800]  I don't know if he listens to the show regularly or at all.
[02:35.800 --> 02:39.760]  Hey, if you're listening, man, big thanks for keeping the website updated.
[02:39.760 --> 02:42.080]  Big thanks for all the updates lately.
[02:42.080 --> 02:46.200]  Also, big thanks for getting it fixed when you do get the RSS feed back in action.
[02:46.200 --> 02:50.600]  All right, since I'm giving shout outs, let's give some shout outs to a few of our Patreon
[02:50.600 --> 02:51.600]  supporters.
[02:51.600 --> 02:53.280]  I owe a big shout out to Jade.
[02:53.280 --> 02:58.400]  How about a big Patreon shout out to Grimble the Druid and also a Patreon shout out to
[02:58.400 --> 03:02.600]  Tanner Martyniuk and of course, another shout out to my friend Mel.
[03:02.600 --> 03:04.160]  Thank you for all the Patreon support.
[03:04.160 --> 03:06.160]  I truly do appreciate it.
[03:06.160 --> 03:12.960]  If you want to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to www.patreon.com.
[03:12.960 --> 03:18.120]  It's P-A-T-R-E-O-N.com slash growfromyourheart.
[03:18.120 --> 03:20.760]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[03:20.760 --> 03:23.520]  And again, thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[03:23.520 --> 03:28.800]  All right, podcast world, I said earlier this was going to be another grow lesson.
[03:28.800 --> 03:34.360]  So far in my series of grow lessons, we should have plants that are probably 12 to 14, maybe
[03:34.360 --> 03:36.320]  16 or 18 inches tall.
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.440]  They are probably in three or five or maybe seven gallon pots.
[03:40.440 --> 03:42.040]  Hopefully they are nice and healthy.
[03:42.040 --> 03:44.160]  They have got a fat root system.
[03:44.160 --> 03:46.260]  Hopefully they're pest free at this time.
[03:46.260 --> 03:49.000]  Hopefully you haven't over or under fertilized them.
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  We've talked a lot about the proper environment and conditions and feeding for these plants.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.560]  So I think we know how to take care of them by now.
[03:55.560 --> 04:01.240]  Let's talk about a few ways to improve our productivity and the vigor of our large veg
[04:01.240 --> 04:02.240]  plants.
[04:02.920 --> 04:04.880]  Now, none of this stuff is required.
[04:04.880 --> 04:06.880]  None of this stuff is mandatory.
[04:06.880 --> 04:12.120]  These are the little tips and tricks and bonus things that I do to boost productivity and
[04:12.120 --> 04:17.440]  boost vigor to kind of turbocharge the overall performance of my garden.
[04:17.440 --> 04:22.600]  One really easy thing I like to do to all of my plants to increase performance is just
[04:22.600 --> 04:25.540]  clean off the crap on the bottoms of the plants.
[04:25.540 --> 04:29.060]  You've got a stalk coming out of the dirt and then you've got a few crappy branches
[04:29.060 --> 04:32.820]  coming off the bottom and then the next couple of branches will be more substantial and then
[04:32.820 --> 04:34.840]  you'll have some solid branches.
[04:34.840 --> 04:39.240]  If those very bottom branches are crappy, don't be afraid to remove them.
[04:39.240 --> 04:43.380]  If you feel like they are a waste of growth on the plant, feel free to take them off.
[04:43.380 --> 04:46.880]  We're going to lollipop heavily once we go into flower.
[04:46.880 --> 04:50.520]  So don't be afraid to move some of the crappy bottom branches.
[04:50.520 --> 04:55.100]  If it's a long healthy branch that has the potential to reach the canopy level, you can
[04:55.100 --> 04:56.100]  leave it.
[04:56.100 --> 05:00.620]  If it's ugly, if it's droopy, if it's sucking up energy and not going to produce anything
[05:00.620 --> 05:03.060]  that would be worthwhile, feel free to take it off.
[05:03.060 --> 05:07.300]  Then that plant can focus its energy moving up toward the top of the plant where we want
[05:07.300 --> 05:09.040]  to build that lush canopy.
[05:09.040 --> 05:11.660]  So feel free to take crap off of the bottom.
[05:11.660 --> 05:15.700]  So now we've removed the crappy bottom branches that are kind of a waste of energy.
[05:15.700 --> 05:20.260]  Here is another thing we can do to the bottom section of our plant to improve the performance
[05:20.260 --> 05:22.620]  and move the energy up toward the top.
[05:22.620 --> 05:26.300]  We've still got bottom branches because we left some of those bottom branches on the
[05:26.300 --> 05:27.300]  plant.
[05:27.300 --> 05:31.340]  The inside bottom branching is not going to receive much light.
[05:31.340 --> 05:36.700]  So what I like to do is find that branch and just follow it up and remove any shoots that
[05:36.700 --> 05:38.780]  I feel like are a waste of space.
[05:38.780 --> 05:42.180]  So you'll have a thick arm coming off and then off of that, you'll have like a little
[05:42.180 --> 05:43.780]  tiny sub arm coming off.
[05:43.780 --> 05:45.100]  Those are the shoots.
[05:45.100 --> 05:46.760]  Those are on the bottom of the plant.
[05:46.760 --> 05:48.340]  Those are a waste of space.
[05:48.340 --> 05:51.260]  Those are going to turn into buds we do not want to trim.
[05:51.260 --> 05:54.740]  It is going to be fluffy, larfy, useless, little crap.
[05:54.740 --> 05:56.100]  It is a trimmer's nightmare.
[05:56.100 --> 06:00.260]  By removing that crap from the bottom, we direct the energy up toward the top.
[06:00.260 --> 06:02.380]  We can make bigger top chunky buds.
[06:02.380 --> 06:03.720]  Those are better for trimmers.
[06:03.720 --> 06:05.100]  Those are better for the market.
[06:05.100 --> 06:06.620]  Those are better for the consumer.
[06:06.620 --> 06:08.620]  Everybody wants those big fat buds.
[06:08.620 --> 06:10.800]  So let's clean off that crap off the bottom.
[06:10.800 --> 06:12.420]  So you've got the main stock coming out.
[06:12.420 --> 06:15.700]  Then you've got your bottom two, your bottom four branches.
[06:15.700 --> 06:19.660]  Follow those branches up and where you don't see any light touching those little shoots,
[06:19.660 --> 06:22.260]  feel free to just pinch them or cut them right off.
[06:22.260 --> 06:26.940]  While you're cutting or pinching or cleaning stuff off of plants, always keep this in mind.
[06:26.940 --> 06:32.300]  You can go back later and take more off, but you cannot glue the leaves and the shoots
[06:32.300 --> 06:33.640]  back onto the plant.
[06:33.640 --> 06:35.820]  So pay attention to what you're doing.
[06:35.820 --> 06:39.300]  But on that bottom section, just pull that crap in the inside right off of there.
[06:39.300 --> 06:42.580]  I go fairly hard on the bottom parts of the plants.
[06:42.580 --> 06:46.060]  I plan on lollipopping heavily early in flower anyway.
[06:46.060 --> 06:50.820]  So why not pull off a lot of that crap now and send the energy up toward the top of the
[06:50.820 --> 06:51.820]  plant.
[06:51.820 --> 06:55.060]  Now, while you're cleaning the bottoms of the plants, keep in mind that it may be wise
[06:55.060 --> 06:58.860]  to take some clones before we put these plants into flower.
[06:58.860 --> 07:01.180]  What are you going to grow next?
[07:01.180 --> 07:03.980]  Are you growing from seed that you spent a lot of money on?
[07:03.980 --> 07:08.380]  If you paid a lot of money for those seeds, I definitely recommend you take a clone off
[07:08.380 --> 07:10.380]  of each seedling and market.
[07:10.380 --> 07:12.660]  We're going to talk about this in depth in a future episode.
[07:13.140 --> 07:17.580]  If you've got a plant from seed, I recommend you take a clone from it.
[07:17.580 --> 07:23.500]  Mark that plant, plant A. Mark your clone, clone A. Go on down the line with every seedling
[07:23.500 --> 07:25.060]  plant that you've got.
[07:25.060 --> 07:26.060]  Then grow them out.
[07:26.060 --> 07:28.700]  Either grow out the clone or grow out the original plant.
[07:28.700 --> 07:33.100]  And if you've got something amazing, now you have got a keeper clone of that to keep around.
[07:33.100 --> 07:34.500]  We're going to talk about pheno hunting.
[07:34.500 --> 07:36.220]  We'll talk about mother plants.
[07:36.220 --> 07:38.620]  We're going to talk about that sort of stuff in a future episode.
[07:38.620 --> 07:42.300]  But this is something to think about while we are cleaning the bottoms of our plants.
[07:42.300 --> 07:46.540]  So you want to use those two bottom branches may make excellent clones.
[07:46.540 --> 07:49.900]  Some of those shoots may have grown big enough to turn into a clone.
[07:49.900 --> 07:53.540]  Keep that in mind while you're cleaning up the bottoms of your plants.
[07:53.540 --> 07:58.060]  Now let's talk about another way to improve the productivity of our plant and also a great
[07:58.060 --> 08:01.980]  way to score a great clone from a healthy plant.
[08:01.980 --> 08:04.260]  And of course I'm talking about topping.
[08:04.260 --> 08:09.220]  Topping our plant can greatly improve the performance of our plant if it is done at
[08:09.220 --> 08:13.780]  the appropriate time and at the appropriate place in the plant.
[08:13.780 --> 08:18.580]  Now when I say appropriate time, we can do this at just about any point in veg once the
[08:18.580 --> 08:19.620]  plant is large enough.
[08:19.620 --> 08:23.220]  The plants we are talking about are certainly large enough if we are in large veg.
[08:23.220 --> 08:25.100]  This is prime time for topping.
[08:25.100 --> 08:32.060]  We have to top approximately 10 to 14 days before we enter the flowering phase.
[08:32.060 --> 08:39.020]  When we top a cannabis plant, our mission is to remove that top node out of the plant,
[08:39.020 --> 08:42.380]  that giant one that's sticking out of the top making it look like a Christmas tree.
[08:42.380 --> 08:44.060]  We want to remove that.
[08:44.060 --> 08:49.100]  And our goal is to make the next set of branches become two tops.
[08:49.100 --> 08:53.420]  And that will create competition within the branches of the plant that will make all of
[08:53.420 --> 08:57.340]  the branches try to reach up and become the next top.
[08:57.340 --> 09:02.460]  Basically, somebody killed the king and now all of those next soldiers are trying to be
[09:02.460 --> 09:03.860]  the next king.
[09:03.860 --> 09:08.660]  The hormones in the plant will indicate we're missing a top, somebody needs to take over.
[09:09.300 --> 09:12.460]  Cannabis has a trait that is called apical dominance.
[09:12.460 --> 09:15.300]  It really wants one dominant top.
[09:15.300 --> 09:19.700]  When you remove that dominant top, the rest of the tops know there's an opportunity for
[09:19.700 --> 09:21.500]  them to become that main top.
[09:21.500 --> 09:26.500]  So you can top the plants at various ages and at various stages.
[09:26.500 --> 09:27.940]  Let's talk about the process of doing it.
[09:27.940 --> 09:29.920]  Let me back up and talk about doing it.
[09:29.920 --> 09:32.020]  Find that top branch where it's too tall.
[09:32.020 --> 09:33.380]  Trace it down.
[09:33.380 --> 09:36.660]  The way I like to do it, I kind of find a spot where I'm thinking about cutting it and
[09:36.660 --> 09:37.700]  I bend it over.
[09:37.740 --> 09:41.460]  And I look at the plant and I say, what would the plant look like without that section?
[09:41.460 --> 09:42.940]  Is that too much to cut off?
[09:42.940 --> 09:44.860]  Is that going to be beneficial?
[09:44.860 --> 09:46.940]  What is my goal in topping right now?
[09:46.940 --> 09:52.300]  Mainly, my goal, instead of having one giant top, I want to create sort of a bush so that
[09:52.300 --> 09:56.480]  I can grow space and not have one giant bud hitting the light.
[09:56.480 --> 10:00.560]  But instead I can have a four by four section of a bunch of buds growing into the light
[10:00.560 --> 10:02.080]  instead of just one.
[10:02.080 --> 10:06.420]  By taking out that main top, you create that whole section into a bush.
[10:06.420 --> 10:11.220]  So see which one is going to cut out and make the others look like a nice, even canopy.
[10:11.220 --> 10:12.220]  You will see it.
[10:12.220 --> 10:13.220]  You'll get good at it.
[10:13.220 --> 10:14.940]  It'll take a little bit of trial and error.
[10:14.940 --> 10:16.500]  It'll take some confidence.
[10:16.500 --> 10:19.920]  It is also very strain specific.
[10:19.920 --> 10:22.940]  Topping an OG Kush or something like that can be a real bitch because the nodes are
[10:22.940 --> 10:26.780]  so far apart that you just make it look like a Charlie Brown Christmas tree.
[10:26.780 --> 10:30.300]  But once it grows out of that, it is going to be amazing.
[10:30.300 --> 10:35.700]  The more sativa dominant stuff, if you top Scarlet Begonias, if you top Storm Shadow,
[10:35.700 --> 10:38.660]  it makes a beautiful bush and they go crazy.
[10:38.660 --> 10:42.860]  So kind of grab the top and follow, work your way down with your hand and just kind of look
[10:42.860 --> 10:45.340]  and see what it would look like if I took this off.
[10:45.340 --> 10:49.500]  And you'll come to a point, you'll take off one and you'll see two branches that stick
[10:49.500 --> 10:53.860]  up evenly toward the top and the two branches underneath that almost come right up to that
[10:53.860 --> 10:55.380]  top section as well.
[10:55.380 --> 10:59.180]  You'll have four nice new tops and you'll say, that's what Rasta Jeff is talking about.
[10:59.180 --> 11:01.620]  I want to make these four tops the tops.
[11:01.620 --> 11:05.100]  Then just cut that one out and you'll see exactly what I've got.
[11:05.100 --> 11:07.860]  You're probably going to screw up a couple of plants.
[11:07.860 --> 11:08.980]  That's how you learn stuff.
[11:08.980 --> 11:11.380]  Musicians have to fuck up songs to learn.
[11:11.380 --> 11:13.660]  BMX racers have to fall on their face to learn.
[11:13.660 --> 11:16.220]  Skateboarders get stitches and break bones to learn.
[11:16.220 --> 11:18.260]  Luckily we mess up plants.
[11:18.260 --> 11:19.420]  We can grow more plants.
[11:19.420 --> 11:23.100]  It doesn't hurt us that bad when we cut up a plant the wrong way.
[11:23.100 --> 11:25.860]  Hopefully you've got a couple more and you're going to learn.
[11:25.860 --> 11:29.800]  The cost of cutting that one plant from what you learn from it is invaluable.
[11:29.800 --> 11:33.380]  So get in there and just play around with the scissors, top some of them, bottom some
[11:33.380 --> 11:34.380]  of them up.
[11:34.380 --> 11:35.380]  See what they do.
[11:35.380 --> 11:36.380]  Finish them.
[11:36.380 --> 11:37.380]  That way you have some data.
[11:37.380 --> 11:41.900]  Now keep in mind that data is very strain specific.
[11:41.900 --> 11:45.460]  Like I said earlier, if you're topping an OG Kush plant, you're going to have totally
[11:45.460 --> 11:50.100]  different results than if you're topping something like a Hayes or a more sativa dominant, like
[11:50.100 --> 11:51.660]  a golden goat kind of a thing.
[11:51.660 --> 11:55.740]  The growth structure is just naturally different in those plants.
[11:55.740 --> 11:59.920]  Now when you're topping your plant, do it at the intersection where it's going to encourage
[11:59.920 --> 12:03.180]  that plant the most expansive growth.
[12:03.180 --> 12:06.660]  So if you've got two branches, you've got the main stock coming up, you've got a branch
[12:06.660 --> 12:11.160]  coming out and then maybe an inch up, you've got a branch coming out, cut right above that
[12:11.160 --> 12:12.160]  top branch.
[12:12.160 --> 12:15.280]  You don't need to leave anything hanging off or anything extra.
[12:15.280 --> 12:19.300]  Cut it right at the intersection where you want to encourage the spread.
[12:19.300 --> 12:23.300]  You basically want to take an upside down peace sign and you want to turn it into a
[12:23.300 --> 12:28.420]  Y and those new tops of the Y are going to be the new two tops of the plant.
[12:28.420 --> 12:31.500]  And then the next two branches, hopefully they'll catch up.
[12:31.500 --> 12:33.060]  Now that puts me back to why I said,
[12:33.060 --> 12:38.300]  we want to do this at least 10 to 14 days before we go into flower or much sooner than
[12:38.300 --> 12:40.680]  that if it's an opportunity.
[12:40.680 --> 12:42.980]  When we make that cut, we've just cut out the king.
[12:42.980 --> 12:47.680]  Like I said earlier, we need time for those hormones to move around into the plant and
[12:47.680 --> 12:51.860]  that helps us when we go into flower, we get much larger bud sets.
[12:51.860 --> 12:56.300]  If you flower too soon after topping, your plants just create little popcorn buds.
[12:56.300 --> 12:58.060]  The hormones haven't moved around.
[12:58.060 --> 12:59.900]  They're not exactly sure what to do.
[12:59.900 --> 13:01.720]  They're not sure where the top should go.
[13:01.880 --> 13:03.880]  So you just get a bunch of little popcorns.
[13:03.880 --> 13:08.200]  So give the plant plenty of time to recover, plenty of time to move the hormones and plenty
[13:08.200 --> 13:13.160]  of time for it to decide where the tops are going to be after topping and before moving
[13:13.160 --> 13:15.520]  your plants into flower.
[13:15.520 --> 13:19.240]  Earlier I mentioned that this would be a good opportunity for a clone.
[13:19.240 --> 13:24.240]  That top you just cut off should be the most robust, hardiest part of your plant.
[13:24.240 --> 13:27.480]  That will make a great candidate for a clone.
[13:27.480 --> 13:29.480]  So why not snag that up?
[13:29.480 --> 13:33.440]  Now you've got a big, fat, healthy clone for the next crop while you're increasing the
[13:33.440 --> 13:35.800]  productivity of the current crop.
[13:35.800 --> 13:40.680]  All right, so we've covered two great ways to increase the vigor and productivity of
[13:40.680 --> 13:41.680]  our plants.
[13:41.680 --> 13:46.160]  We figured out how to properly move the energy to the part of the plant we want to grow.
[13:46.160 --> 13:48.880]  You can move it up to the top by taking stuff off the bottom.
[13:48.880 --> 13:51.840]  You can spread it out by completely eliminating the top.
[13:51.840 --> 13:56.820]  In that process, we have also created the opportunity to create clones.
[13:56.820 --> 14:00.420]  Now let's talk about another great technique that I use in a personal garden.
[14:00.420 --> 14:01.980]  I use this in a breeding program.
[14:01.980 --> 14:04.060]  I use this in a large commercial grow.
[14:04.060 --> 14:07.740]  This is something I implement in almost any grow I get to play in.
[14:07.740 --> 14:10.300]  I call it the pop and twist technique.
[14:10.300 --> 14:12.260]  You may also know it as super cropping.
[14:12.260 --> 14:14.180]  It has got a lot of names.
[14:14.180 --> 14:16.700]  It is the same thing no matter what we call it.
[14:16.700 --> 14:18.940]  I like to pop the stems of the plant.
[14:18.940 --> 14:21.260]  I like to kind of pop their knuckles.
[14:21.260 --> 14:22.700]  I don't know if you could hear that on the microphone.
[14:22.700 --> 14:24.100]  I tried to get it in there.
[14:24.100 --> 14:26.780]  That's basically the sound I'm looking for.
[14:26.780 --> 14:31.380]  Once the plants are a little bit thicker than a pen or a pencil, maybe a sharpie, I like
[14:31.380 --> 14:33.900]  to grab them right where they come out of the dirt.
[14:33.900 --> 14:36.700]  I grab the stalk kind of firmly with one hand.
[14:36.700 --> 14:40.420]  Then I grab it with another hand right above it and I twist my top hand.
[14:40.420 --> 14:42.420]  I don't twist that hand that's coming out of the dirt.
[14:42.420 --> 14:43.580]  I don't want to twist that dirt.
[14:43.580 --> 14:49.660]  I twist the top hand to where I break the cellulose of the plant, break that outer structure
[14:49.660 --> 14:51.020]  to where you hear it pop a little bit.
[14:51.020 --> 14:53.740]  It will go crunch just like my knuckle did.
[14:53.740 --> 14:56.180]  It will make a little pop sound and you'll feel it.
[14:56.180 --> 14:58.180]  You'll be freaked out the first time.
[14:58.180 --> 14:59.180]  It's okay.
[14:59.180 --> 15:00.180]  Don't freak out.
[15:00.180 --> 15:02.500]  You're doing exactly what I recommend.
[15:02.500 --> 15:06.220]  This will increase vigor and productivity in a couple of ways.
[15:06.220 --> 15:08.580]  This will be beneficial in a couple of ways.
[15:08.580 --> 15:11.540]  Let's talk about that real quick and we'll talk more about how to do this throughout
[15:11.540 --> 15:13.180]  the entire plant.
[15:13.180 --> 15:16.300]  The first thing you'll notice when you're popping the knuckles on these plants is they
[15:16.300 --> 15:19.340]  will start to make little knuckles on the branches.
[15:19.340 --> 15:24.740]  I feel like these make the plants more stout, more robust, so that when they start to grow
[15:24.820 --> 15:28.700]  buds, those branches can hold up bigger buds.
[15:28.700 --> 15:30.220]  Bigger branches, bigger buds.
[15:30.220 --> 15:31.220]  That makes sense.
[15:31.220 --> 15:32.460]  You want more support.
[15:32.460 --> 15:34.580]  Bigger legs, you can lift more.
[15:34.580 --> 15:35.580]  You're stronger.
[15:35.580 --> 15:36.580]  I don't know if that mats out.
[15:36.580 --> 15:39.820]  I'm not a weightlifter guy, but if you've got more, you can lift more.
[15:39.820 --> 15:42.180]  You want something able to support bigger buds.
[15:42.180 --> 15:47.100]  Also, those bigger stems can probably feed those bigger flowers better, so you've got
[15:47.100 --> 15:48.580]  more movement.
[15:48.580 --> 15:53.380]  Another way this is beneficial is it will slow down the vertical growth of the plants.
[15:53.380 --> 15:57.620]  They won't get so tall so quickly because they will be spending a little bit of their
[15:57.620 --> 16:00.660]  energy on getting fatter and more robust.
[16:00.660 --> 16:05.980]  They'll be short and stocky, which is way beneficial to almost any grower.
[16:05.980 --> 16:07.560]  Most of us are limited by height.
[16:07.560 --> 16:12.060]  In a home grow, in a commercial grow, in a giant warehouse grow, most of us are still
[16:12.060 --> 16:13.660]  limited by height.
[16:13.660 --> 16:18.220]  Having this one tip to control the height of our plants just a little bit can be very
[16:18.220 --> 16:19.780]  advantageous.
[16:19.780 --> 16:21.480]  Later on, we're going to talk about trellising.
[16:21.480 --> 16:25.320]  If you can use cracking and trellising together, you can really control the height of your
[16:25.320 --> 16:28.480]  plants and you can really maximize productivity.
[16:28.480 --> 16:30.920]  Those are a few reasons why I like to crack the stems.
[16:30.920 --> 16:34.720]  Now, let's talk a little bit more about actually doing it, now that I've given you a good reason
[16:34.720 --> 16:36.400]  why to do this.
[16:36.400 --> 16:41.000]  Like I said, I grab the stick with one hand, I grab the stick with another, and I just
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.200]  twist opposite directions.
[16:43.200 --> 16:44.200]  You'll hear it.
[16:44.200 --> 16:46.760]  It will go pop and crunch, then just move up.
[16:46.760 --> 16:53.240]  I start with the main stock of the plant and I work my way almost 90% up the way of
[16:53.240 --> 16:54.240]  the plant.
[16:54.240 --> 16:57.480]  As long as I can feel it still crunching, as long as I'm not feeling like I'm about
[16:57.480 --> 17:01.800]  to rip the top off the plant when I give it a twist, I'll work my way right up.
[17:01.800 --> 17:05.560]  Then I go to the bottom branch and work my way right up the bottom branch.
[17:05.560 --> 17:07.800]  Then the next branch and give it a crack.
[17:07.800 --> 17:09.000]  I'll give it a crack.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.960]  I'm looking at the microphone stand here, trying to think about the distance of cracks.
[17:11.960 --> 17:16.840]  I'm going to go one, and then it's only four to six inches apart, depending on the size
[17:16.840 --> 17:17.840]  of the plant.
[17:17.840 --> 17:21.320]  I will crack it, maybe if it's a tiny plant, if they're short and squat, I would go every
[17:21.320 --> 17:24.120]  three inches if I feel like that plant could take it.
[17:24.120 --> 17:28.080]  Most of them will take it about every four to six inches without any problems.
[17:28.080 --> 17:32.400]  Give it a little crack, move up, give it a little crack, move up, give it a little crack.
[17:32.400 --> 17:34.600]  Just do that to every plant in the garden.
[17:34.600 --> 17:35.920]  It will slow down their growth.
[17:35.920 --> 17:37.560]  It'll make them more robust.
[17:37.560 --> 17:39.300]  They'll be more vigorous.
[17:39.300 --> 17:43.740]  You can continue to do this all the way into about week three of flower.
[17:43.740 --> 17:47.700]  If you start it early in veg, you can get a good cracking in there.
[17:47.700 --> 17:49.960]  Give them about seven, maybe 10 days to heal up.
[17:49.960 --> 17:53.220]  Go back, give them another good crack, throw them into flower.
[17:53.220 --> 17:56.940]  As they get bigger, they will recover more quickly from being busted on.
[17:56.940 --> 17:59.500]  Go in there and give them a good crack on day one of flower.
[17:59.500 --> 18:03.420]  At the start of the flowering cycle, slow down that stretch a little bit.
[18:03.420 --> 18:04.660]  Think about it this way.
[18:04.660 --> 18:09.600]  If you crack spot one and then spot two, there's a spot in the middle of that that
[18:09.600 --> 18:11.020]  you can crack next time.
[18:11.020 --> 18:12.780]  You can go back in a week.
[18:12.780 --> 18:15.940]  Even if they haven't healed up from all of their cracking, you can crack those middle
[18:15.940 --> 18:21.500]  spots and make even another little knurled spot on your plants.
[18:21.500 --> 18:25.100]  Don't be afraid to get in there and do some work on them and bust them up a little bit.
[18:25.100 --> 18:29.620]  They will recover and they will really show progress from this.
[18:29.620 --> 18:32.780]  I know I probably sound like I'm crazy because for the past 10 minutes, I've been telling
[18:32.780 --> 18:36.180]  you to cut stuff off of your plants and break them and bend them.
[18:36.180 --> 18:38.740]  That's going to increase productivity.
[18:38.740 --> 18:40.220]  How do you get stronger?
[18:40.220 --> 18:42.820]  Through stress, through proper training.
[18:42.820 --> 18:44.060]  That's what we're going to do to these plants.
[18:44.060 --> 18:46.740]  We're going to tell them what we want from them and we're going to show them what we
[18:46.740 --> 18:50.660]  expect and they're going to give it to us with the proper guidance.
[18:50.660 --> 18:54.980]  Speaking of guidance, let's work our way into talking about canopy control.
[18:54.980 --> 19:00.220]  Earlier, I mentioned that our plants are apical dominant, meaning they want to grow straight
[19:00.220 --> 19:01.220]  up.
[19:01.220 --> 19:05.340]  Unfortunately for us as growers, it does not benefit us for the plants to grow straight
[19:05.340 --> 19:06.340]  up.
[19:06.340 --> 19:08.100]  We need to fill horizontal space.
[19:08.100 --> 19:10.080]  We need to spread them out a little bit.
[19:10.080 --> 19:13.900]  We have several options for encouraging our plants to spread out.
[19:13.900 --> 19:18.820]  Our earlier work of topping them was a great start, but we can go much further than that.
[19:18.820 --> 19:24.240]  A very easy, affordable and effective way to spread out our plants a little bit is by
[19:24.240 --> 19:25.440]  using sticks.
[19:25.440 --> 19:29.180]  You can get bamboo sticks at the local growth store for very cheap.
[19:29.180 --> 19:34.380]  I like to put about four sticks per pot and I like to put them toward the outer edge of
[19:34.380 --> 19:35.380]  the pot.
[19:35.380 --> 19:37.980]  Don't go too far in because you've got a lot of root development there.
[19:37.980 --> 19:41.220]  You don't want to go shoving a bamboo stick right through a bunch of roots.
[19:41.220 --> 19:42.940]  Go out toward the edge of the pot.
[19:42.940 --> 19:44.340]  Put the stick in there.
[19:44.340 --> 19:47.980]  If your plants are going to grow six feet tall, get a six foot stick.
[19:47.980 --> 19:51.600]  If your plants are only going to grow three feet tall, get a three foot stick.
[19:51.600 --> 19:55.060]  You don't want a stick too big to where you can't lower the light close enough to the
[19:55.060 --> 19:56.120]  canopy.
[19:56.120 --> 19:57.940]  Get the appropriate size stick.
[19:57.940 --> 20:01.420]  Get three or four, five or six of them in the pot, depending on how many giant floppy
[20:01.420 --> 20:03.460]  branches you've got.
[20:03.460 --> 20:07.380]  Then you can just pull those big branches down just a little bit and attach them to
[20:07.380 --> 20:08.380]  the sticks.
[20:08.380 --> 20:11.700]  Now, instead of just having them going straight up, you've kind of pulled them down a little
[20:11.700 --> 20:12.700]  bit.
[20:12.700 --> 20:16.180]  Now, they're probably one or two, maybe three inches shorter, depending on how far you pull
[20:16.180 --> 20:17.180]  them down.
[20:17.180 --> 20:18.980]  Pull them down and affix them to those sticks.
[20:18.980 --> 20:20.620]  Now, you're doing a couple of things.
[20:20.620 --> 20:25.080]  You're making the plant overall shorter and you're also widening the plant up to let some
[20:25.080 --> 20:28.380]  light get into that inner part of the plant, so where you don't have to clean off as much
[20:28.380 --> 20:31.920]  of that crap in the inside, more of the light can penetrate in there and you will get more
[20:31.920 --> 20:34.840]  production from the inside part of the plant.
[20:34.840 --> 20:37.400]  Now, these sticks will also work for another purpose.
[20:37.400 --> 20:42.040]  When those buds start to develop and get fat and big, those sticks will support your buds.
[20:42.040 --> 20:45.600]  You're going to need something to hold up the big buds, so now is the time to think
[20:45.600 --> 20:46.600]  about it.
[20:46.600 --> 20:51.320]  Let's work that into our canopy control and also our plan for supporting our buds.
[20:51.320 --> 20:53.740]  Sticks is the easiest, most affordable option.
[20:53.740 --> 20:57.580]  If you've got a small grow, if you've got a home grow, sticks are probably the most
[20:57.580 --> 20:58.740]  economical.
[20:58.740 --> 21:03.440]  If you've got several plants, a bunch of sticks can become a pain in the ass.
[21:03.440 --> 21:06.580]  In a commercial environment, I wouldn't even mess with sticks.
[21:06.580 --> 21:10.460]  In a commercial environment, you may want to start working with tomato cages.
[21:10.460 --> 21:14.580]  You need to get the tomato cages on the plants before they get too big.
[21:14.580 --> 21:18.020]  I usually like a tomato cage with about a 16-inch top.
[21:18.020 --> 21:22.820]  Sometimes I will cut the very bottom ring off of the tomato cage, flip it upside down,
[21:22.820 --> 21:24.780]  get where that bottom ring is, cut it off.
[21:24.780 --> 21:27.880]  You've just made it a little bit shorter, but it's also a little bit wider.
[21:27.880 --> 21:31.220]  You can customize them for your situation.
[21:31.220 --> 21:33.620]  So slide the tomato cage over the plant.
[21:33.620 --> 21:35.260]  Spread the plant out nice and wide.
[21:35.260 --> 21:37.500]  Let it spread as wide as it will go.
[21:37.500 --> 21:38.840]  Encourage it to spread out.
[21:38.840 --> 21:43.020]  If you need to pull some of the branches out of the cage, pull it out of the cage, and
[21:43.020 --> 21:47.300]  as it grows, it'll work itself up, and when it gets real tall, put the branch back into
[21:47.300 --> 21:48.300]  the cage.
[21:48.300 --> 21:53.380]  Or use those runners up the side, the side supports, and you can always affix the branches
[21:53.380 --> 21:59.300]  to those side supports by using a bread tie or a twisty tie or some sort of garden supply
[21:59.300 --> 22:00.300]  twist tie.
[22:00.300 --> 22:01.540]  There are thousands of options for that.
[22:01.540 --> 22:02.540]  Get creative.
[22:02.540 --> 22:03.860]  I've used a bunch of different things.
[22:03.860 --> 22:04.900]  We don't need to be too specific.
[22:04.900 --> 22:07.660]  I use zip ties in most cases, but don't go too tight.
[22:07.660 --> 22:11.720]  So if you've got your tomato cage on your plant, the branches are falling out and gaining
[22:11.720 --> 22:14.980]  support from the outer perimeter of the tomato cage.
[22:14.980 --> 22:18.140]  Maybe you've worked some of the branches up the side of that tomato cage.
[22:18.180 --> 22:22.620]  Maybe you've pulled some of the branches down and spread them out by using those outer rings
[22:22.620 --> 22:23.940]  of the tomato cage.
[22:23.940 --> 22:28.420]  The tomato cage gives us a lot of creative options for controlling the canopy of our
[22:28.420 --> 22:34.860]  plant while at the same time providing support for our tall, heavy buds.
[22:34.860 --> 22:38.860]  Now if you're using a tomato cage and you did not top your plant, which is just fine.
[22:38.860 --> 22:39.860]  That is always an option.
[22:39.860 --> 22:41.340]  You do not have to top the plant.
[22:41.340 --> 22:44.420]  A lot of people like that one big glory bud at the top.
[22:44.420 --> 22:49.140]  If you're going for that glory bud and you are using a tomato cage, you still may need
[22:49.140 --> 22:53.820]  a stick to support that giant bud if you grow a big fat top.
[22:53.820 --> 22:56.180]  So don't be afraid to make them work together.
[22:56.180 --> 23:00.140]  You can have a tomato cage with a stick holding up that giant bud in the middle.
[23:00.140 --> 23:04.180]  Again, if you're going to put a stick in a giant pot, I would kind of recommend putting
[23:04.180 --> 23:07.620]  it toward the outer edge and then angling it toward the center if you need support in
[23:07.620 --> 23:08.620]  the center.
[23:08.620 --> 23:11.940]  I don't like to ram a bamboo stake right into the root zone.
[23:11.940 --> 23:13.300]  That just feels rude to me.
[23:13.300 --> 23:16.380]  If you want it to be right in the middle because you've got some kind of OCD or that's
[23:16.380 --> 23:18.620]  where you need to do it, you can do it.
[23:18.620 --> 23:22.460]  But you'll feel it when you go through those roots and it won't feel right.
[23:22.460 --> 23:27.400]  So those are two very effective methods of controlling your canopy and also supporting
[23:27.400 --> 23:30.900]  the large branches and being prepared for having large buds.
[23:30.900 --> 23:33.420]  I know I kind of glazed over those two methods.
[23:33.420 --> 23:36.340]  Those are things you're going to have to perfect and work on.
[23:36.340 --> 23:39.420]  It's going to be things you have to put your hands on to learn how to do it.
[23:39.420 --> 23:40.420]  It's kind of an art.
[23:40.420 --> 23:43.540]  There'll be things that you learn when you're doing it that will work perfectly for your
[23:43.540 --> 23:46.500]  situation that would not work for the next guy.
[23:46.500 --> 23:50.020]  The sticks are really easy because you can just stick as many sticks into a pot as you
[23:50.020 --> 23:51.020]  need.
[23:51.020 --> 23:52.940]  I mean, I've seen people go completely excessive.
[23:52.940 --> 23:56.700]  Try not to be too crazy, but you can stick as many sticks into a pot of soil as you need
[23:56.700 --> 23:59.780]  to support as many branches as you need.
[23:59.780 --> 24:04.380]  And you can use fuzzy sticks or bread ties or zip ties, whatever you need to affix those
[24:04.380 --> 24:07.620]  branches to those sticks however you need.
[24:07.620 --> 24:11.260]  It's a little harder to lower the canopy that way, but you can get big branch support
[24:11.260 --> 24:12.700]  that way really easily.
[24:12.700 --> 24:18.200]  The tomato cages, you can use the zip ties or the twisty ties and you've got round circles
[24:18.200 --> 24:19.200]  to work with.
[24:19.200 --> 24:21.000]  You can use those to keep the plants down.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.340]  You can bend the branches underneath the rings of the tomato cage, or you can use those to
[24:26.340 --> 24:27.660]  support the big buds.
[24:27.660 --> 24:30.580]  You've got a lot of options there to work with, but you're going to have to play with
[24:30.580 --> 24:31.580]  it to figure it out.
[24:31.580 --> 24:35.980]  I can walk you so far through it, but it's going to be strain dependent, situational
[24:35.980 --> 24:39.900]  dependent, but those are very versatile tools to work with and I'm sure you'll find some
[24:39.900 --> 24:40.900]  use.
[24:40.900 --> 24:45.380]  Now, let me quit rambling and talk about one of my favorite methods of canopy control,
[24:45.380 --> 24:50.460]  which is using trellis netting, also known as scrog netting.
[24:50.460 --> 24:53.980]  And of course, scrog, S-C-R-O-G, just means screen of green.
[24:53.980 --> 24:57.940]  We're using a screen to create a nice green canopy.
[24:57.940 --> 25:01.280]  Let's talk about creating a screen of green.
[25:01.280 --> 25:06.000]  The number one most common mistake I see people make when they are setting up their
[25:06.000 --> 25:11.320]  screen or their trellis netting for their screen of green or for their canopy control
[25:11.320 --> 25:14.520]  is they put the netting way too loose.
[25:14.520 --> 25:16.420]  It needs to be tighter.
[25:16.420 --> 25:18.200]  You want that stuff really tight.
[25:18.200 --> 25:19.560]  You want it almost scary tight.
[25:19.560 --> 25:20.800]  You want a lot of tension on there.
[25:20.800 --> 25:24.440]  You don't want those squares, you don't want the net to move at all.
[25:24.440 --> 25:28.840]  You want those squares to stay right in place because that is what is going to control the
[25:28.840 --> 25:30.080]  shape of your plant.
[25:30.080 --> 25:32.160]  If those things move, the plant moves.
[25:32.160 --> 25:36.080]  I like them tight, nice and firm like a guitar string.
[25:36.080 --> 25:40.040]  So let's talk more about the netting now that I've already pointed out the number one mistake.
[25:40.040 --> 25:43.000]  Let's say we're setting up a net in a five by five tent.
[25:43.000 --> 25:44.520]  It's really easy to set them up in a tent.
[25:44.520 --> 25:45.900]  They've already got the poles.
[25:45.900 --> 25:49.740]  If you don't have poles or something to affix it to, you're going to need to design some
[25:49.740 --> 25:50.740]  sort of system.
[25:50.740 --> 25:52.160]  You can attach it to the wall.
[25:52.160 --> 25:56.460]  A lot of people will get a five gallon bucket from Lowe's or Home Depot.
[25:56.460 --> 26:01.100]  They will fill it up with quickrete and then they will stick a six foot tall PVC pole into
[26:01.100 --> 26:02.760]  there sticking straight up.
[26:02.760 --> 26:07.060]  Now you've got a nice vertical pole that you can work with to attach your net to and that
[26:07.060 --> 26:08.420]  will hold a lot of weight.
[26:08.420 --> 26:11.900]  You can probably get it tight enough with that five gallon bucket filled with cement.
[26:11.900 --> 26:15.500]  That'll be enough weight to be able to pull those screens super tight.
[26:15.500 --> 26:19.400]  So get yourself four buckets, fill them up with the quickrete, put a six foot pole in
[26:19.400 --> 26:20.400]  each one.
[26:20.400 --> 26:21.640]  Now you make a little square.
[26:21.640 --> 26:26.380]  Now you can make just about any type of length or width of shape you need to put your trellis
[26:26.400 --> 26:27.400]  netting.
[26:27.400 --> 26:30.820]  I think they sell it in five by five squares, five by 10 squares.
[26:30.820 --> 26:35.980]  If you want to go commercial grade, you can get it in much larger segments, sections,
[26:35.980 --> 26:38.840]  whatever the word you want to use right there, you can get it.
[26:38.840 --> 26:44.480]  In a commercial environment, I recommend the six foot wide commercial greenhouse tables.
[26:44.480 --> 26:50.860]  I have found a six foot wide roll of plastic trellis netting that works beautifully for
[26:50.860 --> 26:51.860]  that application.
[26:51.860 --> 26:58.100]  It is six feet wide and it is I think 75 or 120 feet long and it is one roll.
[26:58.100 --> 27:00.500]  So you just put it up on top of the trellis.
[27:00.500 --> 27:03.540]  You got one guy on one side, one guy on the other, and it's on a roll.
[27:03.540 --> 27:07.900]  So you just walk and you zip tie one end of it down, one end of it down and you walk the
[27:07.900 --> 27:11.180]  length you need to be and you zip tie the other end, zip tie the other end and you cut
[27:11.180 --> 27:13.220]  it off and now the trellis net is up.
[27:13.220 --> 27:17.020]  Of course you got to go back through and tighten it by using more zip ties, but that's almost
[27:17.020 --> 27:19.520]  kind of fun once you've got it put up that easily.
[27:19.520 --> 27:21.960]  So the long rolls are amazing.
[27:21.960 --> 27:26.000]  They get a little bit heavy, but if you've got two big dudes, I'm six five, my buddy
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.480]  Brian, he was six foot something.
[27:27.480 --> 27:32.380]  We just grab it, lift it just above plant height, walk right down the rows, stretch
[27:32.380 --> 27:36.560]  out a long enough piece to cover that whole row, zip tie it at the end and cut our section
[27:36.560 --> 27:37.560]  off.
[27:37.560 --> 27:39.800]  We'd have another guy following behind us and he would put zip ties in place to keep
[27:39.800 --> 27:43.320]  it real tight and it would take us just a few minutes to get each row done.
[27:43.320 --> 27:46.200]  So you've got to start by spreading out your trellis netting.
[27:46.200 --> 27:47.200]  That's always fun.
[27:47.200 --> 27:51.360]  Once it's folded up in that little baggie, it is such a bitch to get that undone.
[27:51.360 --> 27:52.360]  Good luck.
[27:52.360 --> 27:53.880]  You look like Spider-Man attacked you and fucking one.
[27:53.880 --> 27:56.480]  You're going to be there for a few minutes getting that unfolded.
[27:56.480 --> 27:58.600]  The bigger the net, the longer it takes.
[27:58.600 --> 27:59.600]  Don't get frustrated.
[27:59.600 --> 28:01.160]  Go smoke a dab and that, you know what?
[28:01.160 --> 28:05.000]  Don't smoke a dab because when you get all stone and you're trying to look at that netting,
[28:05.000 --> 28:06.560]  that shit doesn't work for your face.
[28:06.560 --> 28:08.120]  So just unfold that.
[28:08.120 --> 28:09.960]  Then once we get it put up, we'll go take some dabs.
[28:09.960 --> 28:11.820]  So unfold the trellis netting the best you can.
[28:11.820 --> 28:13.260]  It's going to take you a few minutes.
[28:13.260 --> 28:15.280]  Get it put up on whatever poles you've got available.
[28:15.280 --> 28:17.560]  I said we're going to work in a five by five tent.
[28:17.560 --> 28:20.800]  Hopefully you bought a five by five section of netting.
[28:20.800 --> 28:21.980]  It may be too big.
[28:21.980 --> 28:23.860]  You may need to go in a square.
[28:23.860 --> 28:25.740]  You may not need to use that outer square.
[28:25.740 --> 28:30.640]  You may need to go one or two squares into that grid to make it fit tight enough.
[28:30.640 --> 28:33.760]  You don't have to necessarily use every square of that netting.
[28:33.760 --> 28:37.120]  We want it tight more than we want the amount of squares.
[28:37.120 --> 28:38.460]  So get that net up there tight.
[28:38.460 --> 28:39.600]  Use a bunch of zip ties.
[28:39.600 --> 28:41.000]  Go excessive if you need it to.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.080]  We want that thing fairly tight.
[28:43.080 --> 28:45.880]  Then lower it down onto the plant canopy.
[28:45.880 --> 28:47.820]  You'll watch the plants kind of bend.
[28:47.820 --> 28:48.820]  You want to just keep going.
[28:48.820 --> 28:50.800]  Just kind of bend them down just a little bit.
[28:50.800 --> 28:51.800]  Not too far.
[28:51.800 --> 28:52.800]  Maybe like three or four inches.
[28:52.800 --> 28:53.800]  They'll bend.
[28:53.800 --> 28:54.800]  They'll be okay.
[28:54.800 --> 28:57.080]  If you see something that's about to crack, of course, grab it and give it a hand.
[28:57.080 --> 29:00.040]  The idea here is to actually lower the height of all of the plants.
[29:00.040 --> 29:03.800]  And we're going to use that net to control the height of the plants.
[29:03.800 --> 29:07.600]  Don't worry because we're going to go back and manually adjust each branch by hand and
[29:07.600 --> 29:09.680]  work it into this net correctly.
[29:10.040 --> 29:14.160]  Right now we just kind of want to lower it down and watch that canopy just become even.
[29:14.160 --> 29:16.560]  Now you can see how this works.
[29:16.560 --> 29:21.360]  We have instead of one giant bud here, one long branch here, one giant bud on a long
[29:21.360 --> 29:22.360]  branch over here.
[29:22.360 --> 29:24.560]  Now we've got a nice even space to work with.
[29:24.560 --> 29:30.280]  We want to fill all that five by five net with a bunch of small bud sites that will
[29:30.280 --> 29:35.960]  actually turn into more productivity than one giant bud here, one giant bud here that
[29:35.960 --> 29:37.120]  are trying to touch the light.
[29:37.120 --> 29:40.240]  We're fighting those from getting too hot, getting burnt, getting crispy.
[29:40.240 --> 29:43.160]  And then we've got a bunch of buds down here that aren't getting enough light.
[29:43.160 --> 29:48.400]  Instead we've got a nice five by five screen of green of just beautiful even buds.
[29:48.400 --> 29:53.880]  So let's talk about how to work these branches into this net to create this desired canopy.
[29:53.880 --> 29:59.260]  Working a section of plants into a trellis net is a bit of an art and it will take some
[29:59.260 --> 30:01.520]  experience to perfect it.
[30:01.520 --> 30:03.040]  Think of it sort of like weaving.
[30:03.040 --> 30:06.240]  We want to weave these plants that want to go vertical.
[30:06.360 --> 30:11.440]  We want to weave them into the net to encourage them to go horizontally.
[30:11.440 --> 30:15.240]  Now almost no matter what we do to these plants other than kill them, they're going to try
[30:15.240 --> 30:20.760]  to grow up because earlier we spoke of that hormone that gives them apical dominance.
[30:20.760 --> 30:25.960]  So we are going to need to stay on top of canopy control in this trellis system.
[30:25.960 --> 30:31.480]  The idea is to fill each square of that trellis net with a branch that will develop into a
[30:31.480 --> 30:33.280]  substantial bud site.
[30:33.280 --> 30:38.480]  The way to start that process is to train these plants to spread wide instead of tall.
[30:38.480 --> 30:43.360]  So we use this first layer of netting to actually spread the plants out.
[30:43.360 --> 30:47.520]  Now what we have to do as the plants grow is they will try to pop up out of the net.
[30:47.520 --> 30:51.400]  We need to go in there every day and grab those branches that tried to get away and
[30:51.400 --> 30:54.300]  just push them back under that next piece of net.
[30:54.300 --> 30:58.560]  So as soon as they're long enough to go underneath the next section, just weave them right underneath
[30:58.560 --> 30:59.560]  there.
[30:59.560 --> 31:03.920]  What will happen is you will develop long arms that fill up the entire space and when
[31:03.920 --> 31:08.600]  we flip it to flower, all of those branches will develop bud sites that will fill up each
[31:08.600 --> 31:11.160]  square of that trellis netting.
[31:11.160 --> 31:14.960]  Now instead of having plants that just grow big giant buds and grow up into the light
[31:14.960 --> 31:19.800]  and are really good for pictures, we are actually producing a large crop by utilizing the entire
[31:19.800 --> 31:22.720]  five by five canopy space.
[31:22.720 --> 31:26.300]  Now this will take some practice to figure out exactly what I'm saying.
[31:26.300 --> 31:29.980]  Some of you are going to try to force those plants down too much.
[31:29.980 --> 31:35.220]  Somebody that taught me a lot of tips on trellis work will tell you, give it a fucking chance.
[31:35.220 --> 31:37.660]  You've got to give it some more to grow up and win.
[31:37.660 --> 31:41.500]  The tips of the branches like to go up, give them a chance to win.
[31:41.500 --> 31:44.180]  But don't be scared to get in there and bend them down.
[31:44.180 --> 31:49.660]  Now something that is hard to convey through just audio without any sort of visual is you
[31:49.660 --> 31:54.420]  may think that to get this branch, the tip of this branch under this net, that you may
[31:54.540 --> 31:56.300]  need to bend it at wrist height.
[31:56.300 --> 31:59.860]  I'm showing myself, I'm comparing the microphone stand to my wrist.
[31:59.860 --> 32:01.260]  The microphone stand is horizontal.
[32:01.260 --> 32:03.180]  My wrist is growing up like a plant.
[32:03.180 --> 32:07.900]  I want to tuck this, my wrist underneath this piece of trellising.
[32:07.900 --> 32:11.500]  Instead of grabbing at my wrist and bending there and tucking that part under, I would
[32:11.500 --> 32:16.940]  actually go down to elbow height, to my elbow joint and pop it down there and bend it underneath
[32:16.940 --> 32:18.500]  the trellis at that height.
[32:18.500 --> 32:22.180]  That gives me a lot more room for when that plant starts growing vertically.
[32:22.180 --> 32:25.020]  It's going to grow out horizontally because of gravity for a little while.
[32:25.020 --> 32:28.780]  The tip will start growing up and it's going to take it a little bit longer to grow up
[32:28.780 --> 32:30.360]  out of that net again.
[32:30.360 --> 32:35.180]  Don't be afraid to crack it lower than you think you need to, is what I'm trying to say.
[32:35.180 --> 32:39.020]  Hopefully that gave you enough different explanations to try to catch on to what I'm saying.
[32:39.020 --> 32:42.660]  But if you think you need to crack it here to get it underneath the net that's right
[32:42.660 --> 32:47.580]  here, go a little lower so you've got more bending room to work with and you've also
[32:47.580 --> 32:50.180]  got more room for future growth.
[32:50.900 --> 32:55.860]  Trellising and canopy work is an art, but when you get good at it, it will drastically
[32:55.860 --> 33:00.060]  improve productivity and it will also make the garden much easier to work in because
[33:00.060 --> 33:04.580]  it's much more organized and you don't have that one giant bud that's trying to grow into
[33:04.580 --> 33:08.680]  the light, which is so photogenic and it's so beautiful to have, but it's also such a
[33:08.680 --> 33:14.420]  pain in the ass because that's the one bud you are working your whole garden setup around.
[33:14.420 --> 33:17.020]  You will learn how to weave your plants into this net perfectly.
[33:17.020 --> 33:18.940]  You will adapt your own style.
[33:18.940 --> 33:22.300]  I'm sure you're going to the internet to look at pictures of how to do it already.
[33:22.300 --> 33:24.180]  You'll see a lot of great stuff on there.
[33:24.180 --> 33:29.040]  You will also see a lot of trellis nets that were not filled sufficiently before the plants
[33:29.040 --> 33:30.540]  were flipped into flower.
[33:30.540 --> 33:31.600]  Fill that shit out.
[33:31.600 --> 33:32.740]  It takes a little bit of time.
[33:32.740 --> 33:39.100]  It takes more work, but it is much more rewarding than just growing that one glory bud.
[33:39.100 --> 33:43.180]  So if you're going to use the screen to spread them out, make sure you fill up that canopy
[33:43.180 --> 33:44.660]  before you flip.
[33:44.660 --> 33:48.500]  Now I also recommend a second layer of trellis netting.
[33:48.580 --> 33:52.300]  I probably would put that one, depending on the power of your light, depending on your
[33:52.300 --> 33:57.780]  genetics, I would probably put my second net somewhere between six and 12 inches above
[33:57.780 --> 33:59.220]  that first net.
[33:59.220 --> 34:01.500]  Now the bottom net will fill up.
[34:01.500 --> 34:03.460]  You'll weave it all in and it will get full.
[34:03.460 --> 34:07.780]  Now you want to let those branches start growing up into that second net.
[34:07.780 --> 34:12.100]  You want to fill it up to where you've got one branch coming out of each of those bottom
[34:12.100 --> 34:15.260]  squares, and those will grow up into the top squares.
[34:15.260 --> 34:18.000]  As soon as they hit the top squares, you want to flower.
[34:18.000 --> 34:24.300]  Now you've got a nice six to 12 inch section of just rows of buds, just rows of branches
[34:24.300 --> 34:25.860]  sticking straight up.
[34:25.860 --> 34:32.800]  I would almost lollipop and bottom and defoliate almost everything underneath that first net.
[34:32.800 --> 34:33.960]  That all gets cleaned off.
[34:33.960 --> 34:37.800]  All that larvae stuff, the canopy is, the light's not going to penetrate the canopy
[34:37.800 --> 34:39.520]  far enough to make that worth anything.
[34:39.520 --> 34:41.720]  I generally clean all that off.
[34:41.720 --> 34:45.000]  So that bottom net is there to spread them out and give them control.
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.040]  You want to spread the plant that would be growing five feet tall straight up.
[34:49.040 --> 34:53.200]  We've got it three feet tall, but it's also spread five by five feet wide.
[34:53.200 --> 34:55.360]  So we're trying to fill in all that net space.
[34:55.360 --> 34:59.100]  Then we're going to let it grow a little bit vertically out of that until it kind of gets
[34:59.100 --> 35:00.760]  close to that next net.
[35:00.760 --> 35:02.080]  Then we're going to flower.
[35:02.080 --> 35:06.120]  All those branches that are sticking straight up are going to turn into big fat buds that
[35:06.120 --> 35:08.120]  will grow into that second net.
[35:08.120 --> 35:11.520]  That second net at that point is going to work as a support.
[35:11.520 --> 35:16.320]  It's only going to be there to hold up all of your giant buds.
[35:16.320 --> 35:20.580]  Quite often in a commercial environment, I've had to use a triple trellis and sometimes
[35:20.580 --> 35:23.000]  we have considered a fourth.
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.200]  That's all going to depend on your genetics and what kind of lights you're using.
[35:26.200 --> 35:30.360]  Of course, we're using things like a rise underneath Gavita lighting in a commercial
[35:30.360 --> 35:31.360]  environment.
[35:31.360 --> 35:33.100]  We were getting serious growth.
[35:33.100 --> 35:36.900]  If you're in a tent, you're only going to need the spread net and then the one net up
[35:36.900 --> 35:38.560]  top for support.
[35:38.600 --> 35:41.840]  If you want to use the trellis netting and you don't want to work it into the net as
[35:41.840 --> 35:46.280]  far, if you just want to use it more for a spread and not kind of create the scrog, you
[35:46.280 --> 35:47.280]  can do that.
[35:47.280 --> 35:49.360]  You don't have to work them as far.
[35:49.360 --> 35:51.840]  You can just put the net on and spread them out.
[35:51.840 --> 35:54.200]  Try to get one stick per branch if you can.
[35:54.200 --> 35:56.040]  Try not to overcrowd anything.
[35:56.040 --> 35:57.880]  The idea is just to spread it out.
[35:57.880 --> 36:00.680]  You kind of want to spread them, make them shorter than they were tall.
[36:00.680 --> 36:04.120]  You want to use more of that vertical space.
[36:04.120 --> 36:07.800]  Somebody taught us a long time ago, if you've got a cooler, do you just want to put one
[36:07.800 --> 36:12.360]  layer of beer in that cooler or do you want to fill that whole cooler up with beer?
[36:12.360 --> 36:14.160]  That's kind of what we're trying to do with our canopy.
[36:14.160 --> 36:16.240]  We don't just want a couple of beers touching the light.
[36:16.240 --> 36:17.920]  We don't want to make a beer tower.
[36:17.920 --> 36:21.520]  We want to knock all those beers down and put them in one nice case just like they were
[36:21.520 --> 36:23.800]  sold in because that's how they stack the best.
[36:23.800 --> 36:24.800]  That's how you can fill it the best.
[36:24.800 --> 36:29.200]  I'm not even a beer drinker and I still want to fit as many beers as we can in a cooler.
[36:29.200 --> 36:33.800]  Also I should recommend an article I read a long time ago by an author named Eric Bixa.
[36:33.800 --> 36:38.320]  The article was called Growing on the Grid and it was exactly on this subject.
[36:38.320 --> 36:43.880]  It talked about maximizing your growth potential by utilizing the horizontal space, not just
[36:43.880 --> 36:47.040]  the vertical space that our plants try to create.
[36:47.040 --> 36:50.200]  One thing I should mention is that you will not be able to move these plants once you
[36:50.200 --> 36:52.240]  put the trellis net on.
[36:52.240 --> 36:56.080]  You've got to do this in whatever room these plants will be flowering in.
[36:56.080 --> 36:59.520]  I started the example by using a 5x5 grow tent.
[36:59.520 --> 37:04.840]  In most cases we would veg in that 5x5, put up the scrog, then flower it in that 5x5,
[37:04.840 --> 37:06.000]  not a big deal.
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.840]  If you are vegging and flowering in a different environment, you will have to veg them, drag
[37:10.840 --> 37:15.520]  them to the flowering room, try to put that trellis up on day one, spread them out nice
[37:15.520 --> 37:16.520]  and wide.
[37:16.520 --> 37:19.760]  You're not going to be able to work them in too much, but you can kind of bend and manipulate
[37:19.760 --> 37:23.280]  the plants a little bit without causing any problems.
[37:23.280 --> 37:26.160]  Use the cracking technique I talked about earlier.
[37:26.160 --> 37:29.760]  Grab the branch, give it a little bit of a twist, and bend it over just a little bit.
[37:29.760 --> 37:31.920]  You'll be able to create a little knuckle there.
[37:31.920 --> 37:33.280]  Also create a nice smooth bend.
[37:33.280 --> 37:37.320]  You can control the plant, aim it any direction you want, move it over to the section of the
[37:37.320 --> 37:38.640]  trellis you need it.
[37:38.640 --> 37:40.520]  Just be very gentle with them.
[37:40.520 --> 37:44.400]  Give them several days to recover before you go back in and crack them again.
[37:44.400 --> 37:47.480]  This is pretty much how we're forced to do it in a commercial environment because we
[37:47.480 --> 37:49.760]  don't veg and flower in the same room.
[37:49.760 --> 37:54.280]  We usually have one large veg area and multiple flowering rooms so that we can keep perpetual
[37:54.280 --> 37:55.600]  cycles going.
[37:55.600 --> 38:00.240]  In a commercial environment, one of my major goals is to harvest and refill a room in the
[38:00.240 --> 38:01.240]  same day.
[38:01.240 --> 38:06.760]  I know that doesn't sound like a big challenge, but imagine if you've got 300 plants in one
[38:06.760 --> 38:08.880]  room, you've got a bunch of trellis netting.
[38:08.880 --> 38:11.240]  It takes half of the day to get it cut down.
[38:11.240 --> 38:14.680]  Then you've got to clean the room spotless, then try to refill it.
[38:14.680 --> 38:15.680]  That's always fun.
[38:15.680 --> 38:17.280]  Then we throw the net on.
[38:17.280 --> 38:21.280]  Then we spend the rest of the day just spreading those plants out and adjusting that net to
[38:21.280 --> 38:24.200]  where those plants aren't too angry with us.
[38:24.200 --> 38:29.880]  That is my long sidetrack ramble-y talk on sticks, cages, and trellis netting and canopy
[38:29.880 --> 38:30.880]  control.
[38:30.880 --> 38:35.440]  I've got a couple more quick things to cover on this list of ways to improve our productivity
[38:35.440 --> 38:37.080]  while in veg.
[38:37.080 --> 38:41.860]  The next thing on my list is integrated pest management and scouting.
[38:41.860 --> 38:47.660]  We should probably be applying a preventative pesticide regimen to our plants at this time.
[38:47.660 --> 38:51.580]  If you're going to use a spray application, now is the time to get started.
[38:51.580 --> 38:55.700]  If you're going to use predator bugs, now is the time to order them and get them prepared
[38:55.700 --> 39:00.240]  so that we have a nice colony before we go into flower.
[39:00.240 --> 39:05.780]  One thing a lot of growers overlook at this stage of the game is manually scouting for
[39:05.780 --> 39:06.780]  pests.
[39:06.780 --> 39:10.940]  One of your best tools in finding bugs in your grow is your own eyes.
[39:10.940 --> 39:16.940]  Spend a little time walking through the garden and just looking for pests or signs of pests.
[39:16.940 --> 39:21.140]  Nature really likes to give us hints that there are problems in our garden.
[39:21.140 --> 39:24.820]  Every pest that comes in gives us some kind of a warning.
[39:24.820 --> 39:28.460]  If you were on top of your game, you've got some yellow sticky traps hanging up and you
[39:28.460 --> 39:31.220]  are checking those on a daily basis.
[39:31.220 --> 39:35.180]  They will give you a fair warning that you've got bugs coming in.
[39:35.180 --> 39:36.340]  You know how they'll tell you?
[39:36.340 --> 39:38.680]  There will be bugs stuck to the yellow card.
[39:38.680 --> 39:40.580]  How much more obvious can it get?
[39:40.580 --> 39:42.980]  So check the yellow sticky traps.
[39:42.980 --> 39:45.500]  Then walk every row.
[39:45.500 --> 39:48.480]  Every few feet, reach into the canopy and grab a leaf.
[39:48.480 --> 39:49.480]  Pull it right off.
[39:49.480 --> 39:50.780]  Flip it upside down.
[39:50.780 --> 39:51.780]  Look at it.
[39:51.780 --> 39:54.380]  Do you see any bugs on the underside of the leaf?
[39:54.380 --> 39:57.420]  Do you see any eggs on the underside of the leaf?
[39:57.420 --> 39:59.060]  Look at the top side of the leaf.
[39:59.060 --> 40:00.520]  Do you see any stippling?
[40:00.520 --> 40:01.780]  That is spider mite damage.
[40:01.780 --> 40:03.020]  Do you see any honeydew?
[40:03.020 --> 40:04.020]  That is thrip damage.
[40:04.020 --> 40:06.940]  Do you see anything that just doesn't look right?
[40:06.940 --> 40:10.780]  That could be a sign of overfeeding, underfeeding, or pH problems.
[40:10.780 --> 40:14.580]  Pay attention to the plants and they will tell you when something is starting to go
[40:14.580 --> 40:16.700]  wrong and you won't need to panic.
[40:16.700 --> 40:19.300]  So scout on a daily basis.
[40:19.300 --> 40:20.640]  Walk through the grow.
[40:20.640 --> 40:21.760]  Look at the plants.
[40:21.760 --> 40:23.160]  Look for mite damage.
[40:23.160 --> 40:24.480]  Look for thrip damage.
[40:24.480 --> 40:25.860]  Go smack the pots.
[40:25.860 --> 40:27.640]  Just give a couple pots a good smack.
[40:27.640 --> 40:28.960]  Does anything fly out?
[40:28.960 --> 40:31.080]  If so, you've got fungus gnats.
[40:31.080 --> 40:34.680]  Those are really easy to treat if you find them early.
[40:34.680 --> 40:36.040]  Scout for bugs.
[40:36.040 --> 40:38.760]  Teach all of your helpers to scout for bugs.
[40:38.760 --> 40:40.440]  Look for spider mite webbing.
[40:40.440 --> 40:43.040]  Also, look for powdery mildew.
[40:43.040 --> 40:45.280]  Look for anything that just doesn't look right.
[40:45.280 --> 40:51.000]  If you are a crew leader, teach people how to properly report the things that they see
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.640]  so they know when to come to you.
[40:52.640 --> 40:55.120]  Some people say, that doesn't look like a big deal.
[40:55.120 --> 40:58.760]  Teach them what is a big deal and what is not a big deal.
[40:58.760 --> 41:00.680]  So always be on the lookout for bugs.
[41:00.680 --> 41:02.800]  Always be scouting and know what you're looking for.
[41:02.800 --> 41:06.800]  You're looking for mites and mite damage, which is webbing, stippling.
[41:06.800 --> 41:08.160]  You're looking for thrip shit.
[41:08.160 --> 41:11.440]  You're looking for thrip honeydew, that glazy stuff on the lower leaves.
[41:11.440 --> 41:12.720]  That's from your thrips.
[41:12.760 --> 41:16.920]  When you tap the pots, those little black things that fly up, those are fungus gnats.
[41:16.920 --> 41:20.920]  When you shake the leaves, those little white bugs that fly out, those are white flies.
[41:20.920 --> 41:25.040]  Be aware of what you're looking for and constantly be looking for them.
[41:25.040 --> 41:29.240]  Healthy plants will be much more vigorous and much more productive than plants that
[41:29.240 --> 41:31.160]  are fighting off insects.
[41:31.160 --> 41:33.160]  Also, scouting is free.
[41:33.160 --> 41:36.480]  It doesn't cost you anything to walk through your grow and look for bugs.
[41:36.480 --> 41:37.720]  You should enjoy it.
[41:37.720 --> 41:38.840]  Put on a podcast.
[41:38.840 --> 41:40.360]  Put on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[41:40.360 --> 41:41.720]  Throw on the Dude Grows.
[41:41.720 --> 41:46.240]  Put on some Joe Rogan and just stroll through the garden and go see what you can find today.
[41:46.240 --> 41:47.360]  Go find the problem.
[41:47.360 --> 41:49.360]  Chances are there's something wrong.
[41:49.360 --> 41:50.520]  You just need to go find it.
[41:50.520 --> 41:52.440]  All right, I'll quit ranting about IPM.
[41:52.440 --> 41:55.320]  Hopefully I have inspired you to go look for bugs in your garden.
[41:55.320 --> 41:59.120]  You know what else is free that will really improve the quality of your garden overall
[41:59.120 --> 42:00.360]  is note-taking.
[42:00.360 --> 42:02.520]  Write down everything you do.
[42:02.520 --> 42:05.960]  That way when something goes wrong, you know what to blame it on and you know what not
[42:05.960 --> 42:07.040]  to do next time.
[42:07.040 --> 42:09.000]  I've done an entire episode on journaling.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.080]  I'm not going to rant too much on that right now.
[42:11.120 --> 42:14.360]  I've got one more thing to talk about and then we're going to wrap up this podcast because
[42:14.360 --> 42:17.000]  my throat is starting to burn out.
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.760]  Another way we can increase productivity and vigor of our veg plants is to augment the
[42:21.760 --> 42:24.840]  CO2 levels in our grow room.
[42:24.840 --> 42:29.960]  The ambient CO2 level in your environment is probably hovering somewhere between 300
[42:29.960 --> 42:32.040]  and 400 particles per million.
[42:32.040 --> 42:33.920]  That is just about the standard on earth.
[42:33.920 --> 42:38.280]  In my last research, it depends on where you are, your elevation, what kind of city you're
[42:38.640 --> 42:43.240]  in, but it's somewhere between 300 and 400 particles per million.
[42:43.240 --> 42:47.920]  Our plants would prefer somewhere around a thousand particles per million.
[42:47.920 --> 42:51.320]  They can take up to 1200, maybe 1500.
[42:51.320 --> 42:56.120]  I've even seen people push them closer to 2000 particles per million of CO2 and the
[42:56.120 --> 42:59.280]  plants just explode with vigorous growth.
[42:59.280 --> 43:03.360]  Now, there are several ways that you can increase the CO2 in your room.
[43:03.360 --> 43:07.680]  One thing I need to mention, once you start increasing the amount of CO2 in your grow
[43:07.680 --> 43:14.800]  room environment, it is very unhealthy for the plants to let the CO2 levels decline past
[43:14.800 --> 43:16.760]  what you have now increased it to.
[43:16.760 --> 43:21.560]  If you start boosting it to a thousand, you either need to keep it at a thousand or increase
[43:21.560 --> 43:22.940]  through flour.
[43:22.940 --> 43:26.380]  Your plant is expecting this CO2 as a new food source.
[43:26.380 --> 43:29.840]  It is now feeding itself like it's got another food source.
[43:29.840 --> 43:33.480]  You have now put your plant into another level of high performance.
[43:33.480 --> 43:35.780]  It's expecting to get that high performance fuel.
[43:35.780 --> 43:42.100]  Once it's adjusted its diet accordingly, if you cut off that extra CO2, it will not
[43:42.100 --> 43:43.700]  be feeding itself properly.
[43:43.700 --> 43:46.420]  You will start seeing nutrient burn.
[43:46.420 --> 43:49.780]  Make sure you keep up on your CO2 habit if you start that habit.
[43:49.780 --> 43:54.160]  Also, if you run out and the plants start acting a little funny, that is probably what
[43:54.160 --> 43:55.160]  is causing it.
[43:55.160 --> 43:56.920]  They're still craving that CO2.
[43:56.920 --> 44:00.860]  They're still trying to readjust their metabolism because they're still on that high performance
[44:00.860 --> 44:03.100]  mode and they're not sure what to do yet.
[44:03.100 --> 44:09.420]  That was my last tip for increasing performance and productivity and vigor of our veg plants.
[44:09.420 --> 44:13.220]  I shared a lot of my dirty secrets, a lot of the things that I use in my personal grows,
[44:13.220 --> 44:15.380]  a lot of things that I use in the commercial grows.
[44:15.380 --> 44:18.420]  I hope you learned something from my talk today.
