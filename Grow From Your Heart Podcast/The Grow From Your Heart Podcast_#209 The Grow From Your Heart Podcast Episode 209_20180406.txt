[00:17.660 --> 00:19.860]  Yeah. Welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.860 --> 00:23.340]  It's time for episode number 209 of the grow from your heart podcast,
[00:23.620 --> 00:27.780]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:27.780 --> 00:29.660]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.660 --> 00:31.780]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:32.100 --> 00:35.180]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:35.180 --> 00:38.820]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:40.020 --> 00:41.860]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.900 --> 00:44.380]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:44.460 --> 00:45.580]  I need to send a huge thank you.
[00:45.580 --> 00:48.260]  Shout out to my friends in the mystic roots band for letting me use their
[00:48.260 --> 00:51.140]  music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat,
[00:51.580 --> 00:55.980]  to the entire mystic roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:55.980 --> 00:59.060]  I am recording on May 18th, 2017.
[01:00.060 --> 01:04.220]  The day Chris Cornell passed away. That's right.
[01:04.220 --> 01:06.380]  I'm sure you've already heard by now. I'm recording on a Thursday.
[01:07.140 --> 01:09.060]  It doesn't come out until Monday. So you will have heard by now,
[01:09.060 --> 01:11.980]  but Chris Cornell passed away today. I heard it a first thing in the morning.
[01:12.060 --> 01:12.780]  I don't know about first thing,
[01:12.780 --> 01:15.580]  but it was one of the first things I heard today as working and someone's like,
[01:15.580 --> 01:19.100]  Hey, Chris Cornell died. And I was like, oh, that's fucked up. I was a grunge kid.
[01:19.140 --> 01:22.540]  I'm from the nineties. I was hitting my adolescence around the 94,
[01:22.540 --> 01:24.700]  95 grunge explosion.
[01:24.740 --> 01:28.260]  I was into Nirvana and sound garden and all that stuff back then.
[01:28.620 --> 01:32.380]  So Pearl Jam was huge, but yeah, that's,
[01:32.420 --> 01:36.020]  it kind of sucks that Chris Cornell died. It makes me think of my friend Ray.
[01:36.180 --> 01:38.060]  Ray, I haven't heard from you. I haven't talked to him in a long time.
[01:38.060 --> 01:40.380]  It's probably my fault. I should reach out and say what's up to Ray.
[01:40.700 --> 01:43.380]  I played in a band called red eye blind fly several years ago.
[01:43.380 --> 01:45.620]  We're quite a good band. In my opinion,
[01:46.100 --> 01:50.620]  the lead singer guitar player was a guy named Ray and he was obviously inspired
[01:50.620 --> 01:51.700]  heavily by Chris Cornell.
[01:51.700 --> 01:56.500]  We did a couple of sound garden songs and he could really belt out that soulful
[01:56.500 --> 01:59.100]  white guy, deep raspy, Chris Cornell thing that happened.
[01:59.100 --> 02:01.820]  I really loved the way Ray did that. So Ray, I hope you're doing well, bro.
[02:01.860 --> 02:04.940]  Sorry that one of your heroes has gone. All your heroes are dying, bro.
[02:05.820 --> 02:08.540]  We're getting old. We're losing people. Now one thing,
[02:08.540 --> 02:10.740]  there's a lot of great sound garden songs that I think of,
[02:10.740 --> 02:13.940]  but one thing that always sticks in my head is that black hole sun video.
[02:13.940 --> 02:16.580]  I will never forget that black hole sun video. That was,
[02:16.980 --> 02:21.100]  I think I was about 14 years old when that came out, maybe 13, 14,
[02:21.100 --> 02:21.940]  maybe 15,
[02:22.260 --> 02:26.100]  but I was into that shit right then and that creepy video was so damn cool.
[02:26.380 --> 02:29.500]  I will never forget that. That was one of the best videos I ever saw on MTV.
[02:29.940 --> 02:32.900]  So a big shout out to Chris Cornell. Sorry we had to lose another legend.
[02:33.380 --> 02:37.220]  Rest in peace. My rock star friend. All right.
[02:37.540 --> 02:39.700]  On the four 20 episode, which was a few episodes ago,
[02:40.100 --> 02:43.220]  I asked people what kind of music they enjoyed listening to.
[02:43.220 --> 02:46.300]  And I got a lot of cool replies. They were still coming in on Twitter.
[02:46.660 --> 02:48.860]  Somebody who calls themselves the can of rat.
[02:48.900 --> 02:52.380]  You can find them at a Trumpster fuego on Instagram.
[02:53.140 --> 02:54.980]  They said that they are into the clash.
[02:54.980 --> 02:59.100]  I could burn and listen on repeat for days if we're still talking music. Yes,
[02:59.100 --> 03:01.380]  we're still talking music. That is an open ended question.
[03:02.060 --> 03:04.380]  If you're out there and you're listening to the podcast and you still have not
[03:04.380 --> 03:05.500]  replied, it's not too late.
[03:05.500 --> 03:08.060]  I want to know what kind of music you listen to when you get blazed.
[03:08.420 --> 03:11.260]  After you take a fat dab, after you smoke a blunt, after you smoke a joint,
[03:11.260 --> 03:14.980]  whatever you, however you choose to medicate, what do you like to listen to?
[03:15.340 --> 03:18.500]  What kind of music do you put on? Send me a tweet at GFYH podcast.
[03:18.900 --> 03:21.100]  I want to know what you're listening to. If you don't want to send me a tweet,
[03:21.260 --> 03:25.260]  a twit. If you don't want to send me a tweet on the Twitter, you can email me.
[03:25.580 --> 03:27.860]  It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[03:28.180 --> 03:30.020]  I'd love to know what you're listening to when you get blazed.
[03:30.220 --> 03:34.220]  It's pretty obvious what I like to listen to. Reggae, fish, Gritful Dead,
[03:34.340 --> 03:36.420]  stuff like that. We're trying to get it moving in the girl.
[03:36.420 --> 03:39.620]  I'll put on some Metallica since I've been working with the James a lot.
[03:39.620 --> 03:42.780]  We listened to a lot of Wheeler Walker Jr. Uh, it's funny,
[03:42.820 --> 03:45.060]  but it will wear on you quickly. Anyway,
[03:45.420 --> 03:48.700]  let's move forward with the show a little bit. What did I do this week? Dang,
[03:48.700 --> 03:53.460]  you guys, I smoked a 42 gram joint with Doug Benson and a few other folks,
[03:53.860 --> 03:58.500]  uh, by the dumpster behind comedy in downtown Denver,
[03:58.500 --> 04:01.380]  Colorado. That's right. Uh, comedy works. Uh,
[04:01.380 --> 04:05.380]  they do not condone or promote or advocate cannabis smoking outside of their
[04:05.380 --> 04:08.980]  building. They actually get kind of frustrated with me when I do it. Uh, but,
[04:09.420 --> 04:11.300]  uh, they, they, they tried.
[04:11.300 --> 04:14.740]  The one of the security guards tried to stop me and he had a list and I just
[04:14.740 --> 04:16.780]  talked shit back to him because he was a security guard and he wasn't going to do
[04:16.780 --> 04:18.540]  much to me. And I wasn't afraid he was a big fat guy.
[04:18.860 --> 04:22.660]  I can take three steps from him and he'd never catch me. Uh, but anyway,
[04:22.980 --> 04:26.620]  I smoked a 42 gram joint with Doug Benson and a bunch of other folks outside of
[04:26.620 --> 04:30.220]  comedy works. After I saw it live taping of one of my favorite podcasts,
[04:30.220 --> 04:32.740]  Doug loves movies. That's right. Doug loves movies came Denver.
[04:33.340 --> 04:36.100]  They recorded at the comedy works. It was freaking hilarious.
[04:36.660 --> 04:40.500]  I drove up there with my lovely date. We got there kind of early.
[04:40.500 --> 04:43.740]  We got into the show just after doors opened. Of course,
[04:43.740 --> 04:46.940]  I am treated like a rockstar at comedy works. I got my VIP seating.
[04:47.220 --> 04:50.900]  I had very front row seats. My feet were on the stage until the show started.
[04:50.900 --> 04:54.540]  I was relaxing, chilling out, drinking a root beer. Uh, we had a pretzel.
[04:55.100 --> 04:57.860]  I was pretty, pretty stylish. Uh,
[04:57.860 --> 05:00.620]  so Doug Benson came out and started the Doug loves movies podcast.
[05:00.620 --> 05:04.300]  His guests were a comedian by the name of apples. Uh,
[05:04.700 --> 05:07.660]  something something Appleton is his name, but he just goes by apples.
[05:07.660 --> 05:12.180]  He's a big jolly dude. Uh, I don't know. I don't have a way to describe him.
[05:12.700 --> 05:16.260]  Uh, he was a little bit in appearance,
[05:16.260 --> 05:18.980]  maybe a little Chris Farley, but smaller in the head,
[05:19.020 --> 05:20.420]  like Chris Farley with the shrunken head.
[05:20.420 --> 05:22.500]  And I know that's a fucking rude thing to say, but it's accurate.
[05:22.540 --> 05:25.380]  Anybody who knows apples would call him Chris Farley with the shrunken head.
[05:25.900 --> 05:28.020]  Uh, he was fucking funny, a little dry humor,
[05:28.620 --> 05:30.020]  but when you're on Doug loves movies,
[05:30.020 --> 05:31.820]  you have to just get them in when you can.
[05:31.820 --> 05:35.660]  And he seemed like a quieter shyer kind of guy. He had that quieter demeanor.
[05:35.660 --> 05:38.180]  So he wasn't shooting them out once toward the end of the show, he got going,
[05:38.860 --> 05:42.260]  but, uh, it took him a minute to get going anyway. So apples was there.
[05:42.300 --> 05:46.020]  Doug Benson was there. There was also another comedian known as Chad Daniels,
[05:46.020 --> 05:48.700]  who was fucking funny. He's kind of a dark guy.
[05:48.700 --> 05:52.100]  He's got like a dark twisted personality. I like that sort of shit.
[05:52.100 --> 05:56.420]  So that was really funny. And also on the Doug loves movies, podcast, live taping.
[05:56.740 --> 06:01.260]  The third guest was none other than Mark Otter Wahlberg. That's right.
[06:01.260 --> 06:02.500]  A guy who calls himself Mark.
[06:02.580 --> 06:06.660]  The Otter Wahlberg was a guest on Doug loves movies.
[06:06.660 --> 06:09.180]  And I hate to spill the beans for anybody else that listens to the,
[06:09.500 --> 06:13.540]  to the Doug loves movies podcast. It's a dude dressed like Mark Wahlberg.
[06:13.780 --> 06:14.620]  He wears a wig.
[06:14.780 --> 06:18.100]  He wears a little Mark Wahlberg outfit and a chain and some brand new shoes.
[06:18.100 --> 06:20.180]  And he grabs his dick a lot and it's fucking funny.
[06:20.580 --> 06:24.060]  And he nails the Mark Wahlberg accent. But honestly, it's not fucking Mark.
[06:24.420 --> 06:26.660]  But don't tell anybody I said that, but it's not Mark Wahlberg.
[06:26.660 --> 06:29.660]  I met him after the show to do it with the bald head. I forget his fucking name.
[06:29.660 --> 06:33.540]  I'm just going to call him Mark Wahlberg forever. Uh, it's fucking hilarious.
[06:33.540 --> 06:36.660]  You guys, if you listen to this podcast, that means you know how to do it.
[06:37.060 --> 06:40.900]  Go find Doug loves movies and listen to the podcast from Denver that was
[06:40.900 --> 06:43.100]  recorded on mother's day. It's fucking funny.
[06:43.140 --> 06:44.860]  And then you'll be addicted to another podcast.
[06:44.860 --> 06:49.140]  He plays a lot of games on there. Uh, if you're, if you're new to it,
[06:49.140 --> 06:51.300]  it'll take you a few episodes to catch onto the games.
[06:51.620 --> 06:53.900]  But once you catch onto the games, you'll be addicted to them.
[06:54.540 --> 06:57.340]  You'll catch yourself playing those games with your friends in the car. Uh,
[06:57.340 --> 06:59.900]  you'll catch yourself yelling out answers to the games that they're playing.
[06:59.900 --> 07:01.780]  It's all movie related trivia. Uh,
[07:01.780 --> 07:05.220]  so I recommend the Doug loves movies podcast. Big shout out to Doug. Uh,
[07:05.260 --> 07:07.300]  shout out to apples, shout out to Chad Daniels,
[07:07.540 --> 07:10.020]  shout out to the person known as Mark Wahlberg.
[07:10.380 --> 07:14.060]  They put on a hilarious show. You guys, it's all spontaneous. It's all improv.
[07:14.060 --> 07:16.500]  There's nothing planned out. Doug has a little show planned out.
[07:16.500 --> 07:18.860]  He asks a few questions, does some games and shit. But other than that,
[07:18.860 --> 07:23.780]  it's just people chatting. And I laughed my ass off. My date laughed her ass off.
[07:23.780 --> 07:27.580]  We had a wonderful time. A big shout out to my friend Baker,
[07:28.460 --> 07:32.060]  Baker dude. Thanks for the hospitality. Had a great fucking time with you.
[07:32.300 --> 07:35.220]  It's always good to see Baker. Uh, he just puts a smile on my face.
[07:35.220 --> 07:38.340]  If you guys know Baker, you know why? Also big shout out to comedy works for
[07:38.340 --> 07:41.660]  always treating me like a King. Uh, I love going to comedy works.
[07:41.660 --> 07:44.620]  I highly recommend you check out comedy at comedy works.
[07:44.620 --> 07:47.860]  If comedy works is not near you, go to the comedy club in your area. Go.
[07:48.220 --> 07:51.700]  If there's an open mic in your area, go listen, go listen to the comedians.
[07:51.700 --> 07:54.780]  Be quiet. Don't fucking heckle them. Don't interrupt them. Don't talk over them.
[07:55.140 --> 07:58.140]  Be polite. Sit there, shut up, listen to comedy, laugh. When they're done,
[07:58.180 --> 08:01.100]  you clap. When the next guy comes up, you clap, make him feel welcome.
[08:01.140 --> 08:04.220]  When he tells jokes, he laughed. Don't talk over anybody. Don't do that bullshit.
[08:04.540 --> 08:08.740]  Buy drinks, tip your bartender. That's how you do comedy. I don't buy drinks.
[08:08.740 --> 08:12.940]  I buy root beer and pretzels, but I tip well. So anyway, uh, super,
[08:13.060 --> 08:16.100]  super great comedy show comedy works. A shout out to my date, JB.
[08:16.100 --> 08:18.140]  Thanks for coming with me. We had a great ass time.
[08:18.180 --> 08:23.020]  I look forward to the next adventure. Uh, you guys, I am rambly.
[08:23.300 --> 08:26.360]  And that's because I've been smoking some of the high cannabinoid full spectrum
[08:26.360 --> 08:30.460]  extract from our friends at apothecary. I've spoken, smoking some star dog. Uh,
[08:30.500 --> 08:33.940]  right now I'm actually smoking a little bit of this lemon Jeffrey Ambrosio,
[08:33.940 --> 08:36.700]  which is their line of live resin. I really love this stuff.
[08:37.300 --> 08:38.820]  I picked that up at elevations.
[08:38.820 --> 08:41.220]  I'm sure I've talked about that in previous podcasts,
[08:41.620 --> 08:45.660]  but this brings me to a point on the previous episode.
[08:46.060 --> 08:50.300]  I spoke about high cannabinoid and high terpene full spectrum extracts.
[08:50.700 --> 08:53.980]  I kind of explained a little bit how they're done. Um,
[08:54.020 --> 08:56.100]  I didn't explain completely cause I wasn't aware.
[08:56.540 --> 08:58.740]  It turns out a friend of mine came over and he's like, dude,
[08:58.740 --> 09:02.100]  I make that shit and you kind of skipped a couple of steps, which is fine.
[09:02.100 --> 09:06.180]  He asked me not to tell you guys the steps that he skipped because it's kind of
[09:06.180 --> 09:10.060]  the top secret tech. And honestly, nobody wanted to fucking tell me everything.
[09:10.420 --> 09:13.060]  And he's like, this is what you miss, but do not say that on the podcast.
[09:13.100 --> 09:16.220]  And I respect my friend. I'm not going to tell you what he said,
[09:16.580 --> 09:18.260]  but I gave you most of the info.
[09:18.260 --> 09:20.100]  There are a couple of things you're going to have to learn for yourself.
[09:20.100 --> 09:22.180]  Most of it's on the internet. I'm sure. Uh,
[09:22.220 --> 09:25.140]  anybody that puts enough energy into it and effort into it,
[09:25.140 --> 09:28.260]  you'll be able to find out how to do it online. It's all there. Uh,
[09:28.260 --> 09:29.860]  one thing that I wanted to mention though,
[09:29.900 --> 09:34.900]  what makes high cannabinoid full spectrum extract officially full spectrum
[09:35.500 --> 09:40.500]  extract is two separate lab tests for it to actually can be qualified as full
[09:40.740 --> 09:41.340]  spectrum extract.
[09:41.340 --> 09:46.340]  You need a lab test of the starting buds and you also need a lab test of the
[09:46.340 --> 09:50.220]  finished product. I'm going to explain this the best I can.
[09:50.220 --> 09:51.700]  I did not make any notes on this.
[09:51.700 --> 09:53.540]  This is all going to come out of the top of my head.
[09:53.580 --> 09:56.340]  Let me talk myself through it. Follow me the best you can.
[09:56.820 --> 09:59.580]  So you have flowers, you take a lab test of those flowers.
[09:59.820 --> 10:03.740]  Let's say hypothetically they have 100.
[10:04.100 --> 10:07.180]  I'm not going to say a hundred that'll fucking throw us off. They have 22.
[10:07.180 --> 10:08.220]  I don't know what the values are.
[10:08.460 --> 10:11.700]  They have 22. I don't know what the values are. I'm just making up values.
[10:11.700 --> 10:16.620]  They have 22 terpenes and 57 THC. No, we can't do odd numbers.
[10:16.620 --> 10:17.540]  That's going to fuck my math up.
[10:17.540 --> 10:18.900]  So I told you I'd talk myself through this.
[10:19.140 --> 10:22.180]  We've got 20 terpenes and 50 cannabinoids.
[10:22.660 --> 10:27.220]  So when we make the concentrate out of that, the math has to transfer.
[10:27.220 --> 10:31.900]  You have to have a two and a five as your ratio that those numbers have to move
[10:31.900 --> 10:34.980]  over. They don't have to have the same percentages,
[10:34.980 --> 10:37.700]  but the ratios need to be similar. Uh,
[10:37.700 --> 10:39.980]  they need to match up. It needs to be the same fraction.
[10:40.260 --> 10:42.340]  As what I guess I'm saying, the ratios need to stay.
[10:42.340 --> 10:45.500]  The same is basically how it is. So unless you're,
[10:45.500 --> 10:47.380]  cause you were trying to get the full spectrum,
[10:47.380 --> 10:51.380]  you're trying to get all of the terpenes and cannabinoids from that flower into
[10:51.380 --> 10:54.620]  that extract. That's what makes it a full spectrum extract.
[10:54.620 --> 10:58.980]  You have pulled the full spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenoids and anything
[10:58.980 --> 11:00.300]  that is valuable medicinally,
[11:00.300 --> 11:03.500]  you've pulled it all out of there and you have put that into your extract.
[11:03.900 --> 11:04.860]  That's the idea there.
[11:04.860 --> 11:08.140]  And it's also cleaned of anything else of plant fats and anything else.
[11:08.380 --> 11:12.700]  Lipids is what they'll call that. I think. So the tests have to match.
[11:12.980 --> 11:16.940]  The ratios have to be the same. If you've got a five and a one,
[11:17.220 --> 11:18.420]  however the math works out,
[11:18.620 --> 11:21.300]  your next test has to be divisible by that five and that one.
[11:21.500 --> 11:24.940]  The buds are going to test lower obviously because they're flowers and the
[11:24.940 --> 11:26.340]  concentrate is going to test higher.
[11:26.580 --> 11:31.500]  So if you've got 20% THC in your flower and 1% terpenes,
[11:32.020 --> 11:36.060]  then your concentrate is probably going to have 80% THC.
[11:36.300 --> 11:37.780]  And then what I do is multiply that by four.
[11:37.780 --> 11:40.980]  So you're going to have 4% terpenes. The math has to multiply.
[11:41.300 --> 11:43.620]  Whatever the one number is multiplied by,
[11:43.660 --> 11:46.020]  the other number has to be multiplied by as well. All right.
[11:46.420 --> 11:47.980]  I think I made sense out of that in my own head.
[11:47.980 --> 11:49.900]  I hope I made sense of that in your head.
[11:50.180 --> 11:53.980]  The only way to prove that it is high cannabinoid or high terpene full spectrum
[11:53.980 --> 11:58.020]  extract. And also I've seen them combine it. Some folks call it sauce.
[11:58.060 --> 12:00.220]  Some folks don't. There's a lot of different,
[12:00.220 --> 12:02.620]  there's a lot of proprietary shit that happens in this industry.
[12:02.620 --> 12:06.100]  And that's this high cannabinoid full spectrum extract is about to be the next
[12:06.300 --> 12:09.620]  proprietary thing like live resin. When live resin got popular,
[12:09.620 --> 12:13.060]  people argued that you could only make live resin in a specific machine because
[12:13.060 --> 12:16.420]  a certain person invented it and he ran it in that machine the first time.
[12:16.860 --> 12:18.460]  So it kind of got labeled like the Whopper.
[12:18.460 --> 12:21.660]  You can't buy a Whopper at McDonald's and you can't buy a Big Mac at Burger
[12:21.660 --> 12:22.500]  King.
[12:22.780 --> 12:26.980]  You can't make live resin in a sweet leaf extractor because it only comes from
[12:26.980 --> 12:28.980]  an OB dose. That's not my rule.
[12:28.980 --> 12:32.620]  That's just what I was taught from the person who made the OB dose and who made
[12:32.620 --> 12:36.260]  live resin. So the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract,
[12:36.260 --> 12:40.020]  you need the two lab tests. It's going to be the, these new,
[12:40.020 --> 12:41.740]  the high cannabinoid, the high terpene,
[12:42.020 --> 12:44.380]  the THCA crystals that are floating out of it,
[12:44.420 --> 12:47.540]  then the different combinations of how they're putting the terps, the THC,
[12:47.540 --> 12:49.420]  the cannabinoids, everything back together.
[12:49.580 --> 12:52.260]  They're all going to be a bunch of different proprietary names like this, uh,
[12:52.500 --> 12:56.060]  this live resin that I'm smoking from apothecary extracts. It is live resin,
[12:56.060 --> 12:59.580]  but they have chosen to differentiate or delineate themselves from the market
[12:59.580 --> 13:01.100]  by calling it. Did I use that word correctly?
[13:01.100 --> 13:03.340]  I just threw that fucking out there. I hope that went well. Uh,
[13:03.340 --> 13:06.700]  they're trying to separate themselves from the market and stand out by calling
[13:06.700 --> 13:09.820]  it Ambrosia, which is a really cool term. Honestly,
[13:09.820 --> 13:11.740]  when I went through the first time I was like, what the fuck's Ambrosia?
[13:11.780 --> 13:13.860]  I don't know what that is. You're going to have to explain.
[13:14.220 --> 13:18.380]  And they avoid saying it's live resin. They say it's our fresh frozen product.
[13:18.740 --> 13:21.220]  And I'm like, is that, and you know what I mean? And you don't want to ask,
[13:21.220 --> 13:23.860]  is that just live resin, bro? Cause then you sound like kind of like a dick,
[13:23.900 --> 13:26.700]  just blowing down their name. Like, yeah, bro, but I named it this,
[13:27.020 --> 13:29.540]  but they've named it that to separate themselves a little bit.
[13:30.700 --> 13:33.100]  A lot of that's going to happen in the future here with all the science and
[13:33.100 --> 13:35.100]  tech and people are just trying to stand out.
[13:35.100 --> 13:38.340]  People want to keep the money come their direction by having exclusive products.
[13:38.740 --> 13:42.300]  Anyway, my point was you need to lab tests if you want to actually call it that.
[13:42.300 --> 13:45.620]  And I know that I left out a few steps because the people that are sharing the
[13:45.620 --> 13:48.540]  info with me don't want me to share everything with the whole damn world.
[13:48.740 --> 13:52.620]  They've got some secrets and they want to keep them to themselves. All right,
[13:52.620 --> 13:55.980]  I'm going to move on from this part and let's talk about where are we going to
[13:55.980 --> 13:58.460]  go? Let's jump to this message from Kelvin.
[13:59.500 --> 14:02.260]  I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say Kelvin's name out loud, but I just did.
[14:02.580 --> 14:05.700]  Anyway, my friend Kelvin sent me a Facebook message and it says, Hey, great.
[14:05.780 --> 14:07.460]  Uh, Hey Jeff, great podcast Monday.
[14:07.860 --> 14:10.900]  I'll be listening to the one you uploaded today. Hopefully tomorrow.
[14:11.380 --> 14:12.900]  And he keeps going and then he says,
[14:13.140 --> 14:16.660]  I felt dumb when he read that I take a bong hit out of my bubbler. Dang.
[14:16.980 --> 14:20.260]  I know never to use those words together. And then he sent a smiley face emoji,
[14:20.900 --> 14:23.180]  bro. We're just picking on you. I know you meant you knew better.
[14:23.380 --> 14:24.980]  I say a lot of dumb shit on this podcast.
[14:24.980 --> 14:27.980]  So if you want to just take sound bites and send them to me to pick on me,
[14:28.420 --> 14:29.620]  that's fair game. Also,
[14:29.700 --> 14:32.740]  I feel like I just invited all of the trolls by saying that let's hear it.
[14:32.780 --> 14:33.740]  I'll make it, I'll play it.
[14:33.940 --> 14:35.780]  I'll fucking put it at the end of a show at some point,
[14:36.020 --> 14:38.420]  cut out all the dumb shit I've said and put it in a loop to a beat.
[14:39.100 --> 14:43.860]  And then I'll play it as like an ending theme song. That'll be cool. Anyway,
[14:43.860 --> 14:47.300]  Kevin goes on and he said, Kelvin goes on. I said, Kevin, I apologize, bro.
[14:47.540 --> 14:50.100]  Kelvin goes on and he says, I wanted to ask you,
[14:50.100 --> 14:53.620]  what is the best material to use for light reflection at home Depot?
[14:53.900 --> 14:56.620]  They have Panda film. Is this any better than my law?
[14:56.620 --> 14:58.540]  I want to purchase this Panda film for my room,
[14:58.740 --> 15:01.820]  but I am scared that the Panda film will create, will create hotspots.
[15:01.860 --> 15:05.540]  Thanks in advance for the input. Uh, dude, I fucking hate my law.
[15:05.540 --> 15:09.900]  My law sucks. Uh, my law is hard to hang. It tears. It doesn't stick. Well,
[15:09.940 --> 15:11.740]  it's hard. If you tape it to the wall, it shall tear.
[15:12.100 --> 15:14.820]  It does that weird rippling thing and it drives, I've got a head injury.
[15:14.860 --> 15:18.300]  So that weird rippling thing from my law fucks with my eyes. Uh,
[15:18.340 --> 15:21.940]  I think Panda film is much better. It's much more reliable. It's a little thicker.
[15:22.260 --> 15:26.300]  Uh, go with the Panda film all day. Every day is my opinion. Uh, Panda film,
[15:26.380 --> 15:29.220]  the ceiling, the walls and the floor tape it up real well.
[15:29.420 --> 15:33.260]  I think Panda film is the way to go. I like it better. It lasts longer.
[15:33.260 --> 15:37.620]  It's easier to clean. It's much easier to put up. I think my law that it just,
[15:37.780 --> 15:40.540]  once you get a little rip in it, it just rips forever. And it's,
[15:40.580 --> 15:44.580]  it's a real bitch. I just don't like it. I think Panda film is the way to go.
[15:45.420 --> 15:47.380]  Quick and easy answer, right? I hope I helped you out, bro.
[15:47.420 --> 15:50.980]  Get some Panda film do that shit. All right, I've got another email.
[15:51.220 --> 15:54.580]  This one's going to be a lot longer than the first one. I'm gonna,
[15:54.580 --> 15:55.740]  I'm trying to give it a quick read over.
[15:55.740 --> 15:59.660]  Cause I'm looking to see if these guys want me to use their names.
[16:00.420 --> 16:03.980]  Um, I'm not going to say their name.
[16:03.980 --> 16:06.500]  I'll just read their location at the end. So it's going to go like this.
[16:06.500 --> 16:08.700]  Here's an email from a listener. And if you'd like to email me,
[16:08.700 --> 16:11.700]  you can send me an email. It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[16:12.100 --> 16:15.180]  I would love to hear from you. Maybe I'll read your email on a show.
[16:15.940 --> 16:19.140]  I've got a lot of emails here in my phone. Uh, they're coming up. You guys,
[16:19.140 --> 16:21.300]  I've got a lot of them saved. I can only do so much content.
[16:22.100 --> 16:23.540]  I work a full job. I've got a life.
[16:23.980 --> 16:27.860]  I try to put a lot of energy into the podcast about once or twice a week that I
[16:27.880 --> 16:30.060]  could dedicate time to do it. No excuses,
[16:30.060 --> 16:33.420]  but I got a roof leak and I sit right here when I record and the roof leak is
[16:33.420 --> 16:34.460]  about two feet in front of me.
[16:34.780 --> 16:37.780]  So sometimes that gets in the way until that gets fixed. But anyway,
[16:38.740 --> 16:40.740]  I'm going to read your email on a future episode is what I'm saying.
[16:40.740 --> 16:42.460]  If you've sent me an email and it's got a good question,
[16:42.460 --> 16:45.540]  I will read it and I'll try to get to it before your garden is harvested.
[16:45.900 --> 16:48.100]  Cause some people have fucking cut down their crops since they asked me
[16:48.100 --> 16:49.460]  questions. And I apologize for that.
[16:49.780 --> 16:52.740]  I'm going to read this guy's email and quit rambling. It goes like this.
[16:52.740 --> 16:53.540]  Hey Ross to Jeff.
[16:53.540 --> 16:57.100]  I am a new listener over the last several months from Northern California.
[16:57.380 --> 17:00.700]  I love the show. Good information, great guests and overall chill vibe.
[17:00.700 --> 17:04.300]  Listening always. We're off to a good start. This is a great fucking email.
[17:04.300 --> 17:07.100]  Thanks for the great compliment to open up. Then he says,
[17:07.100 --> 17:10.580]  I often hear you invite listeners to reach out that you enjoy hearing from us.
[17:10.580 --> 17:13.580]  And I actually believe you. So here I am. Hey, I believe you so much.
[17:13.620 --> 17:14.820]  Are you believe me so much? Wait,
[17:15.060 --> 17:18.300]  what I meant to say was I mean that so much that I'm actually reading your
[17:18.300 --> 17:21.820]  episode or your fuck. I can't speak. I'm not even going to edit this. Uh,
[17:21.820 --> 17:24.060]  this is from the dab I took right before I hit record.
[17:24.460 --> 17:28.740]  I meant it so much that I am reading your actual email on this episode.
[17:29.020 --> 17:30.740]  That's how I meant it. I'm glad you believe me.
[17:31.180 --> 17:35.780]  So then he goes on to say I represent that forties or fifties demographic who
[17:35.780 --> 17:39.340]  left a vibrant cannabis scene in the eighties or nineties to grow up and become
[17:39.340 --> 17:43.300]  responsible. Four years ago, I was not doing well physically. So in,
[17:43.820 --> 17:47.020]  and in what the hell moment I saw a doctor who recommended cannabis,
[17:47.300 --> 17:50.020]  no turning back. What a wonderful journey it has been.
[17:50.100 --> 17:54.300]  I lost 60 pounds made progress in a number of areas related to health and made
[17:54.300 --> 17:58.580]  additional life changes to support the immediate benefits realized from using
[17:58.660 --> 17:59.500]  cannabis.
[18:00.140 --> 18:03.500]  So this dude went to the doctor who recommended using cannabis and the next
[18:03.500 --> 18:05.060]  sentence is no turning back.
[18:05.220 --> 18:07.980]  This dude lost 60 pounds by using cannabis as a medicine.
[18:08.180 --> 18:09.980]  And he doesn't mention what his health condition was,
[18:10.220 --> 18:12.940]  which isn't super important. The point is that cannabis worked.
[18:12.940 --> 18:16.940]  He lost 60 pounds and made progress in a number of areas related to health.
[18:17.260 --> 18:21.900]  And it also inspired him to make additional life changes to support the immediate
[18:21.900 --> 18:25.980]  benefits realized from using cannabis. This guy used cannabis, felt better,
[18:26.020 --> 18:30.580]  which inspired him to get even better. Preach cannabis. I love you.
[18:30.940 --> 18:34.100]  I'm going to keep reading. It goes on to say as an avid high times reader,
[18:34.100 --> 18:37.300]  starting at the age of 15, I am now living my boyhood dream,
[18:37.340 --> 18:39.100]  growing and breeding legal cannabis.
[18:40.820 --> 18:43.620]  I have to change pages. And then it says, where did it go? I lost it.
[18:43.620 --> 18:46.580]  I bring with me 30 years of breeding and growing experience from other
[18:46.580 --> 18:49.980]  disciplines. And this leads me to my question for you.
[18:50.500 --> 18:54.820]  We can read almost any work on cannabis botany and find the author lotting the
[18:54.820 --> 18:56.300]  adaptability of cannabis.
[18:56.380 --> 18:59.740]  I agree with that premise that cannabis is radically adaptable.
[19:00.020 --> 19:03.260]  Cannabis root or Alice is an observable Testament of that fact. Yet,
[19:03.540 --> 19:07.260]  as a growing community and perhaps more so as breeders are in my estimation,
[19:07.300 --> 19:12.020]  working against ourselves in this regard by building almost sanitary laboratory
[19:12.020 --> 19:15.780]  like conditions, sure it is optimal, but is it necessary?
[19:15.980 --> 19:19.860]  We don't allow the cannabis to adapt or breed strains that adapt because the
[19:19.860 --> 19:24.660]  majority of folks intervene environmentally before cannabis is ever called upon
[19:24.660 --> 19:28.660]  to adapt. I agree with you and I've got,
[19:29.300 --> 19:32.660]  I agree with you, but I'm going to argue with you just to play devil's advocate,
[19:32.660 --> 19:36.140]  but I want to continue with the email. Then you go on to say,
[19:36.260 --> 19:39.420]  let me give you an example. I recently constructed a small secure green,
[19:39.660 --> 19:40.500]  greenhouse.
[19:40.540 --> 19:44.300]  The plan was and is to install climate control as well as an already installed
[19:44.300 --> 19:48.180]  light deprivation setup. I had to change pages. So let me find where I am.
[19:48.180 --> 19:49.020]  There we go. However,
[19:49.020 --> 19:52.500]  in early March I stuck a dozen or so plants in there with no supplemental heat
[19:52.500 --> 19:56.540]  or light just to observe the results were mixed, excuse me,
[19:56.540 --> 19:58.700]  but surprisingly forest strains performed quite well,
[19:58.700 --> 20:01.860]  including two of my home bred creations. Good job, man.
[20:01.900 --> 20:03.860]  It sounds like you've read some great shit and nice work breeding.
[20:04.420 --> 20:07.700]  Several others fell extremely short of acceptable. Keep in mind,
[20:07.700 --> 20:12.700]  we were seeing swings from 39 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit and 15 to 88% relative
[20:14.100 --> 20:17.060]  humidity. I still have two plants flowering in yesterday.
[20:17.380 --> 20:22.180]  We saw 56 to 109 degrees Fahrenheit and still no signs of distress with the
[20:22.200 --> 20:25.340]  remaining strain either. I'm impressed that I'm an impressed.
[20:25.340 --> 20:30.340]  Also those plants are getting super cold at night and they're sweltering in the
[20:30.340 --> 20:31.180]  heat during the day.
[20:31.940 --> 20:36.020]  They're trying to figure out life every day. Like what the fuck is this?
[20:36.020 --> 20:38.460]  What the fuck is this? The end of their day is a struggle.
[20:38.460 --> 20:40.820]  The start of their day is a struggle and they're not fucking up.
[20:40.820 --> 20:43.820]  Those are some hardy plants. Nice work. You go on to say,
[20:43.820 --> 20:45.660]  clearly nobody would recommend this environment.
[20:45.680 --> 20:49.100]  Yet I see where tapping back into the adaptability of cannabis can play a
[20:49.100 --> 20:52.500]  significant role into the development of strains that may exceed the narrow
[20:52.520 --> 20:54.900]  margins of environmental tolerance that we see now.
[20:55.420 --> 20:59.180]  What if we create stable strains that don't fall over and will with 60 degree
[20:59.180 --> 21:04.140]  temperature swings in a four or five hour period and still have other desirable
[21:04.160 --> 21:07.980]  traits we all seek in high quality cannabis. Uh,
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.220]  I lost my place again. Isn't this the very making of a superior gene pool?
[21:12.700 --> 21:15.460]  When you start thinking about the monetary savings on energy,
[21:15.660 --> 21:18.860]  a lighter carbon footprint from our industry and less crop failure from some
[21:18.860 --> 21:22.660]  random equipment malfunction. Even when we do have an ideal environment,
[21:22.680 --> 21:27.680]  it seems to me we may still be a bit collectively misguided as an industry in our
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.960]  breeding philosophies or inputs.
[21:30.160 --> 21:32.640]  Everyone talks about getting back to heirlooms and land races.
[21:32.660 --> 21:35.320]  And I agree that this is a really good direction.
[21:35.720 --> 21:38.600]  Could it be at least in part because they are much more adaptable?
[21:38.880 --> 21:43.000]  I sure think so. What are your thoughts? Anyhow,
[21:43.020 --> 21:45.880]  keep rocking the podcast in much respect. Uh,
[21:45.920 --> 21:49.440]  big gear from NorCal and Gary, I hope I was supposed to say your name,
[21:49.800 --> 21:53.520]  but that looks like it's kind of a nickname. Shout out. Thank you for the email.
[21:54.200 --> 21:55.600]  You raise a really good question.
[21:55.600 --> 21:58.680]  I'm going to scroll back up and try to answer the questions one at a time here.
[21:59.320 --> 22:02.440]  Before I do it, I'm going to take a drink. I'm not even going to press pause.
[22:02.440 --> 22:04.320]  I'm just going to take a drink. You guys are gonna have to deal with me.
[22:05.200 --> 22:09.080]  Think about the frosty cold, Dr. Pepper. I'm sipping right now. These 23 tarps.
[22:09.120 --> 22:11.520]  Oh, nothing like it. I'm going to quit rambling for a second.
[22:11.540 --> 22:21.780]  I'm going to hydrate my face. Let's do this. Oh yeah.
[22:22.460 --> 22:25.300]  I know I said hydrate my face and this Dr. Pepper is not going to do shit for
[22:25.300 --> 22:28.020]  hydration. I think I meant caffeinate my face. That's what I meant.
[22:29.020 --> 22:32.700]  All right. I'm freshly caffeinated. I'm ready.
[22:32.700 --> 22:36.780]  Let's answer some questions here from our friend, big Garrett NorCal. All right.
[22:38.380 --> 22:42.700]  So first thing he mentions is, uh,
[22:42.820 --> 22:45.700]  that we're using sanitary and, uh,
[22:46.380 --> 22:50.500]  I forgot the words that he used sanitary, sanitary laboratory, like conditions.
[22:50.500 --> 22:54.100]  And then he said, sure, it is optimal, optimal, but is it necessary?
[22:54.500 --> 22:55.540]  Because with those conditions,
[22:55.580 --> 22:59.580]  we don't allow cannabis to adapt and we don't breed strains that adapt because
[22:59.580 --> 23:02.900]  the majority of the folks intervene environmentally. That's the key that got me.
[23:03.540 --> 23:07.220]  A majority of folks intervene environmentally before Canada cannabis has ever
[23:07.240 --> 23:08.380]  called upon to adapt.
[23:09.700 --> 23:14.620]  A lot of me thinks that we are breeding specific strains to grow in
[23:14.620 --> 23:17.940]  specific environments because everybody is growing in that environment.
[23:18.220 --> 23:21.580]  But I also think they're growing in that environment because that's what works.
[23:21.620 --> 23:24.780]  That, uh, that is the most,
[23:25.380 --> 23:29.100]  in my, in my grow, not my grow in the grow where I am employed. Uh,
[23:29.100 --> 23:32.540]  I manage the three rivers, uh, organics grow in Pueblo West.
[23:32.580 --> 23:34.060]  We have got somewhere between,
[23:34.060 --> 23:35.940]  we just got a whole bunch of new stuff recently too.
[23:35.940 --> 23:39.620]  So we've got about 50 strains I'll say about 50 mother plants.
[23:39.940 --> 23:41.860]  That means at any one time I could be running.
[23:42.700 --> 23:45.620]  I try to only run about six strains in one room to tell you the truth.
[23:46.700 --> 23:50.300]  All of those strains need a little bit different stuff.
[23:50.580 --> 23:53.220]  Like they would want them strain over here would like a little more cow mag.
[23:53.220 --> 23:55.420]  This strain over here would like it to be a little bit colder,
[23:55.980 --> 23:57.660]  but I can't do that to all of them.
[23:58.540 --> 24:01.300]  So what we have found is the window and I'm sure you understand what I'm talking
[24:01.300 --> 24:04.060]  about. I'm just explaining this as my opinion. I'm not trying to,
[24:04.060 --> 24:06.940]  sorry if I sound condescending, we found the window that they will,
[24:07.380 --> 24:10.820]  they prefer to be about 70 to 75,
[24:10.820 --> 24:14.740]  maybe 77 degrees at the most is where all of those plants will be happy.
[24:15.700 --> 24:19.180]  Sure. If I had one strain, I would dial it in perfectly. Uh,
[24:19.180 --> 24:22.980]  and I would get that laboratory light condition. Perfect for that one strain,
[24:22.980 --> 24:24.740]  which is exactly against what you're saying.
[24:25.260 --> 24:29.660]  But the good part about that and in my, in the industry we're in now,
[24:29.660 --> 24:34.380]  we can't rely on what ifs and strains that may adapt and may pull through.
[24:34.380 --> 24:38.980]  I can't risk my multimillion dollar facility on
[24:39.020 --> 24:42.500]  environmental question marks. I need to be able to control it every day.
[24:42.780 --> 24:47.620]  And I know that those plants are going to grow that way because we've bred
[24:47.620 --> 24:48.580]  plants to do that.
[24:48.580 --> 24:51.780]  And I know that they're going to grow that way at my facility here and the next
[24:51.780 --> 24:54.980]  facility I'm building and the facility that I'm building after that,
[24:55.380 --> 24:57.860]  because we're going to set up the same environment in all of them.
[24:58.300 --> 25:03.140]  So that way I know that when I take these clones from this grow to this
[25:03.140 --> 25:03.980]  grow, to this grow,
[25:03.980 --> 25:06.900]  I can set up consistent environments and grow them all the same.
[25:07.380 --> 25:10.820]  So that's part of that. That's why we're doing the same environment,
[25:10.820 --> 25:14.500]  the same laboratory conditions. Cause I can't afford environmental weather,
[25:15.060 --> 25:16.500]  uh, catastrophes at random.
[25:16.500 --> 25:20.940]  And I can't risk my plants doing weird shit by not creating those conditions.
[25:20.940 --> 25:25.260]  I need those optimal conditions. Uh, the owner of my facility, if I told him,
[25:25.260 --> 25:28.420]  let's just take off the roof and rely on the weather. I live in Colorado, man.
[25:29.460 --> 25:34.180]  Uh, it is May 18th and it hailed a good four inches of hail in Pueblo West today.
[25:34.180 --> 25:35.940]  It sounded like we were just getting bombed.
[25:35.940 --> 25:38.060]  We couldn't even talk to each other because the hail was so loud on the
[25:38.060 --> 25:40.300]  building. Uh, all of the plants would be gone.
[25:40.340 --> 25:43.940]  If we just trusted the outdoor weather and they would be outside right now
[25:44.100 --> 25:47.580]  growing healthily. So we can't rely on that here in Colorado.
[25:47.580 --> 25:49.580]  That's why we've got to use these laboratory, uh,
[25:49.580 --> 25:53.100]  sterile laboratory, boring conditions. I do agree with you.
[25:53.380 --> 25:55.500]  We should be breeding there.
[25:55.860 --> 26:00.540]  There are breeders in other locations probably who are breeding things like
[26:00.540 --> 26:04.940]  yourself for their environment because they don't have the grow rooms that we've
[26:04.940 --> 26:07.940]  got, but they're not the popular breeders around here, uh,
[26:07.940 --> 26:11.700]  probably in Spain or somewhere else where, excuse me,
[26:11.700 --> 26:14.620]  somewhere else where they're growing outdoors. Uh,
[26:14.660 --> 26:17.860]  and they don't have the, the rooms that we have here.
[26:17.980 --> 26:20.900]  They've probably bred stuff to grow better wherever they are. That's,
[26:20.900 --> 26:22.980]  I'm sure that most of the world does that.
[26:22.980 --> 26:24.620]  That doesn't have the technology we've got.
[26:24.620 --> 26:26.820]  They breed it to work better for them. Uh,
[26:26.860 --> 26:30.060]  and then they probably find the strugglers like you do.
[26:30.700 --> 26:32.820]  They're probably forced to breed that way.
[26:33.020 --> 26:34.940]  What makes it through the season is what makes it.
[26:34.940 --> 26:38.060]  So that's what breeds and what makes it that survival of the fittest.
[26:38.060 --> 26:40.940]  That's how nature does it. I agree with you. That is ideal.
[26:41.340 --> 26:45.300]  But in this new industry, uh, it, the,
[26:45.340 --> 26:46.140]  those traits,
[26:46.140 --> 26:49.660]  if the plant is going to survive in super cold or super hot conditions,
[26:49.660 --> 26:52.220]  hopefully that never happens in my grow. Honestly,
[26:52.220 --> 26:55.980]  I've paid a lot of money to prevent that from happening. I've got a HVAC,
[26:56.020 --> 26:57.780]  I've got electricians, I've got plumbers,
[26:58.060 --> 27:01.060]  I've got them all on call in my phone super quickly.
[27:01.060 --> 27:04.140]  And they usually show up within two hours if I tell them, Hey,
[27:04.140 --> 27:07.220]  it's a fucking emergency. So hopefully I never experienced that.
[27:08.700 --> 27:10.580]  So everything I'm working with, uh,
[27:10.620 --> 27:15.180]  is aimed at just producing either super great flavor or a very
[27:15.180 --> 27:19.900]  specific cannabinoid ratio or super high THC or super high CBD.
[27:20.380 --> 27:23.860]  Uh, I feel like those plants that, uh, would struggle,
[27:23.860 --> 27:28.260]  would survive better in a struggle are not going to be the connoisseur
[27:28.260 --> 27:32.340]  quality cannabis. So you can have super high quality cannabis come from that
[27:32.340 --> 27:33.100]  struggle.
[27:33.100 --> 27:37.620]  But I feel that the stuff that's been bred to just produce super
[27:37.620 --> 27:40.380]  high THC or very specific flavor,
[27:40.540 --> 27:44.380]  it's going to perform better in a very controlled environment.
[27:44.380 --> 27:47.140]  That's what it was bred for. So I don't, I,
[27:47.900 --> 27:50.980]  I hate to say I don't think you're going to get as good quality out of that
[27:50.980 --> 27:53.580]  outdoor struggle stuff. It's going to spend more of its,
[27:53.820 --> 27:57.380]  more of its traits are going to be designed at surviving.
[27:57.580 --> 28:01.580]  And I want traits that don't have to be so strong to survive that they can make
[28:01.580 --> 28:03.700]  more flavor and more THC.
[28:03.700 --> 28:07.380]  I do agree with you that we should be breeding for the strength and stuff,
[28:07.380 --> 28:10.020]  but for my industry, we can't do that. Uh,
[28:11.020 --> 28:15.180]  there's so much money on the line. I need a more reliable product for my shelf.
[28:15.500 --> 28:19.900]  Uh, my, the clientele have higher expectations when they come to the store,
[28:20.460 --> 28:23.380]  they want to see, they know what strains our store is going to have.
[28:23.380 --> 28:26.900]  And they want to see those strains the best they can be or better than last time.
[28:27.420 --> 28:32.420]  And if I don't get as many days of the sun or get too many cold days or
[28:32.420 --> 28:37.140]  too many hot days, and there are so many variables that plays into profit margins,
[28:37.220 --> 28:41.020]  that plays into customer return plays into satisfaction.
[28:41.380 --> 28:46.260]  And honestly, very small swings like that in this industry can close a business.
[28:46.500 --> 28:48.820]  That's, that's a lot of why people can't play like that.
[28:48.820 --> 28:51.500]  I want to get back to your email. Cause I feel like I'm really rambling today.
[28:53.820 --> 28:55.420]  All right. And the last paragraph of your email,
[28:55.420 --> 28:58.540]  you say when you start thinking about the monetary savings on energy,
[28:58.540 --> 29:01.780]  a lighter carbon footprint from our industry and less crop failure from some
[29:01.780 --> 29:05.500]  random equipment malfunction, even when we do have an ideal environment,
[29:05.740 --> 29:10.340]  it seems to me we may still be a bit collectively misguided as an industry in
[29:10.340 --> 29:12.500]  our breeding philosophies or inputs.
[29:12.820 --> 29:15.460]  Everyone talks about getting back to heirlooms and land races.
[29:15.460 --> 29:17.900]  And I agree that it's a really good direction.
[29:18.260 --> 29:21.860]  Could it be at least in part because there are, they are much more adaptable.
[29:21.900 --> 29:26.180]  I sure think so. What are your thoughts? Anyhow, keep rocking the podcast.
[29:26.180 --> 29:30.860]  Much respect. Anyway, um, the part you say right here,
[29:30.860 --> 29:32.100]  there are a couple of things I want to touch on.
[29:32.300 --> 29:34.540]  When you start thinking about the money savings on energy,
[29:34.580 --> 29:37.620]  a lighter carbon footprint from our industry and less crop failure from some
[29:37.620 --> 29:41.140]  random equipment malfunction. Even when we do have an ideal environment,
[29:41.180 --> 29:44.020]  it seems to be, we may be misguided. Um,
[29:44.820 --> 29:49.500]  I don't know that the monetary savings would be worth it if I don't have this
[29:49.500 --> 29:51.580]  same consistency in my product.
[29:51.580 --> 29:53.380]  And I know it sounds like I'm nitpicking and I'm being weird,
[29:53.380 --> 29:54.220]  but uh,
[29:54.620 --> 29:57.860]  I've been in business meetings with operations managers and such.
[29:57.900 --> 30:00.980]  And I feel that, uh, I don't know.
[30:00.980 --> 30:03.220]  The quality is where it's at right now in Colorado.
[30:03.220 --> 30:08.100]  That's the only thing separating us. There are dispensaries wherever you are.
[30:08.180 --> 30:10.820]  I can't say wherever, almost wherever you are. If you're in a city,
[30:10.820 --> 30:15.100]  a populated city, there is a dispensary 15 to 30 minutes away. No problem.
[30:15.300 --> 30:19.220]  I've got 20 choices that I could drive to in no, no time at all. Uh,
[30:19.220 --> 30:22.420]  probably 10 recreational and 20 medicinal, uh,
[30:22.460 --> 30:25.860]  medical marijuana dispensaries. I could just drive to what separates them.
[30:26.020 --> 30:29.620]  A little bit is pricing. Uh, I do okay financially.
[30:29.820 --> 30:33.100]  So what separates them for myself is quality. Uh,
[30:33.100 --> 30:37.060]  whoever's got the best is where I go. And, uh,
[30:37.300 --> 30:39.740]  I don't buy flour personally. I buy concentrates,
[30:39.740 --> 30:43.260]  but if I were to go buy flour, I would go for the best flour.
[30:43.740 --> 30:48.060]  And I feel like the indoor stuff that's been bred for that is going to be the
[30:48.060 --> 30:52.220]  best flour available on the market. I do agree with you as a breeder in the
[30:52.220 --> 30:53.340]  breeding aspect. Yes,
[30:53.340 --> 30:56.300]  we should be breeding stuff that is more adaptable for the outdoor stuff,
[30:56.300 --> 30:58.020]  but that's going to be more, uh,
[30:59.620 --> 31:02.980]  there are outdoor grows here, but they are also set up to be quite well.
[31:02.980 --> 31:06.340]  I think the gorilla growers are going to be the ones that want that outdoor
[31:06.340 --> 31:07.620]  stuff. That is still quality.
[31:07.820 --> 31:11.460]  There's no hype in the land race type stuff is also what the problem is.
[31:11.460 --> 31:14.140]  These new strains, they all have a name tag on them.
[31:14.380 --> 31:16.460]  It goes around the internet. It goes around Instagram.
[31:16.460 --> 31:20.460]  It goes around Facebook. It comes out in a rap song and that shit sells.
[31:20.580 --> 31:22.740]  People want the hype. That is a lot of it.
[31:23.420 --> 31:25.940]  And a lot of those strains that get the hype were bred indoors.
[31:26.260 --> 31:27.220]  A few episodes ago,
[31:27.460 --> 31:31.060]  I mentioned that I think a lot of Dutch breeders and the Dutch breeding turned
[31:31.060 --> 31:34.180]  cannabis into a pussy. So we are on the same page with that.
[31:34.500 --> 31:35.860]  But at the same time we couldn't,
[31:36.140 --> 31:39.820]  we might not have a lot of these amazing flavors and cannabinoid specific things.
[31:39.820 --> 31:40.700]  If we weren't breeding it,
[31:40.700 --> 31:44.140]  we're kind of sacrificing the toughness for other traits.
[31:44.340 --> 31:47.780]  I feel like maybe you get, if it were a video game, you'd get a hundred, uh,
[31:47.820 --> 31:50.020]  what are they? Uh, attribute points or whatever.
[31:50.220 --> 31:51.940]  And you get to assign them however you want.
[31:52.220 --> 31:54.620]  And I feel like if you're going to use a lot of them to adaptability,
[31:54.620 --> 31:59.620]  you may be taking attribute points away from other things like high THC,
[31:59.780 --> 32:03.220]  high flavor, or whatever it may be that you're looking for.
[32:03.380 --> 32:05.740]  I do agree with you in some aspects,
[32:05.820 --> 32:09.980]  but as a commercial grower who has to reach goals or, uh,
[32:09.980 --> 32:14.060]  I don't get a paycheck. I really rely on the, uh,
[32:14.100 --> 32:17.220]  the breeding of strains that they just rely on a very specific environment.
[32:17.220 --> 32:22.220]  And then I rely on that environment being reliable and consistent and specific.
[32:22.620 --> 32:25.980]  So as a breeder, I do agree with you 100%.
[32:25.980 --> 32:30.260]  We should be breeding strains to be more adaptable, a little more vigorous,
[32:30.940 --> 32:35.820]  but also I'm a weed snob and some of my favorite strains to smoke or a little
[32:35.820 --> 32:37.860]  bitch to grow. So I think that's like the trade-off.
[32:38.460 --> 32:40.500]  If you've bred something that has the, uh,
[32:40.540 --> 32:43.900]  the desirable traits of say like a popular strain,
[32:43.900 --> 32:46.620]  what's real popular without saying one of my strains, uh, tangy,
[32:46.820 --> 32:47.660]  if you've read something,
[32:47.660 --> 32:50.620]  that's the quality of tangy and I can leave it outside in the snow here in
[32:50.620 --> 32:52.740]  Colorado, you're a fucking champion.
[32:52.740 --> 32:56.460]  And I would love some seeds or a clone and I would love to grow and smoke and
[32:56.480 --> 33:00.380]  breed and work with something that you've created that is that adaptable.
[33:01.220 --> 33:04.460]  So to answer your main question, yes, I do agree that, uh,
[33:04.980 --> 33:09.300]  creating strains that have all the desirable traits plus adaptability
[33:10.220 --> 33:12.980]  is the key to making a superior gene pool. Unfortunately,
[33:13.180 --> 33:17.020]  there is no hype in that. Uh, we are not, everyone's looking for those strains.
[33:17.020 --> 33:19.580]  We're all breeding and growing it in these perfected grow rooms.
[33:19.580 --> 33:20.660]  So we're not going to find that.
[33:20.940 --> 33:23.620]  I'm thankful that there are guys like you out there, uh,
[33:23.660 --> 33:28.420]  breeding and checking out so extremely severe conditions for these plants.
[33:28.420 --> 33:31.100]  I'm impressed with what you did and I appreciate it. Hey,
[33:31.100 --> 33:34.220]  now I've got a couple of questions for you. What are you breeding with? Uh,
[33:34.220 --> 33:38.460]  what's the cross that did so well in your extreme conditions. And, uh,
[33:38.460 --> 33:41.220]  do you have anything out there that I've may have read about or heard about?
[33:41.220 --> 33:44.420]  Have you made any crosses that I've gotten any notoriety or anything?
[33:44.460 --> 33:48.140]  I'm just curious about your breeding because obviously I'm a breeding nut also.
[33:48.460 --> 33:50.940]  And I'm just curious what my listeners have going on. Hey,
[33:50.940 --> 33:55.820]  big shout out to big gear out there in NorCal. I appreciate the email.
[33:56.380 --> 33:58.860]  If anybody out there has a question, you can send me an email.

[34:01.060 --> 34:04.620]  I would love to answer your question on the show.
[34:05.180 --> 34:06.460]  Coming up on a future episode,
[34:06.460 --> 34:10.660]  I've got a kind of a lengthy episode from somebody that asks for updates about
[34:10.740 --> 34:14.340]  old guests and they ask a lot of interesting questions that I will answer on the
[34:14.340 --> 34:18.660]  show. Also, we've got a question about a wet or dry trimming for better turps.
[34:18.940 --> 34:22.740]  And then I've got a question about flushing and soil and cocoa.
[34:22.940 --> 34:25.580]  So I will get to those on a future episode,
[34:25.780 --> 34:29.100]  but my throat's burning out and I'm sure your attention deficit disorder is
[34:29.100 --> 34:31.980]  kicking in. So I'm going to remind you about Patreon.
[34:31.980 --> 34:34.180]  If you felt like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks,
[34:34.420 --> 34:39.420]  you can contribute to the podcast by going to patreon.com slash grow from your
[34:39.740 --> 34:40.580]  heart. That's right.

[34:45.100 --> 34:47.900]  And what I'm going to do with your contribution is I'm going to pay for my web
[34:47.900 --> 34:51.140]  hosting to keep the podcast on the website for free.
[34:51.140 --> 34:52.820]  I never want to charge you for the podcast,
[34:53.020 --> 34:55.460]  but I'm sure there's a couple of people out there that would like to contribute
[34:55.460 --> 34:58.060]  to the Patreon account that goes straight to my PayPal.
[34:58.260 --> 35:02.540]  I use my PayPal to pay my blue host hosting and that keeps the podcast up.
[35:02.820 --> 35:04.940]  That keeps it here for you guys for free.
[35:05.100 --> 35:08.020]  Also I'm putting all of the older episodes up on YouTube.
[35:08.020 --> 35:09.100]  By the time this comes out,
[35:09.100 --> 35:12.420]  I should have about 50 episodes posted to the YouTube channel.
[35:12.700 --> 35:14.860]  The first 19 are on an old channel,
[35:14.860 --> 35:19.340]  so they're just shared as a playlist and then 20 through whatever will be up on
[35:19.340 --> 35:23.140]  the grow from your heart podcast, YouTube channel. I plan on catching up.
[35:23.140 --> 35:26.100]  I'm at episode 209 right now. There are 50 up there.
[35:26.380 --> 35:28.300]  You're going to have to give me some time to get caught up,
[35:28.340 --> 35:32.580]  but I've been doing one or two a week. Uh, it's, it's a lot of stuff to do.
[35:32.580 --> 35:35.700]  I work a full time job. Like I said earlier, I've got friends and family.
[35:35.900 --> 35:38.380]  I've got a daughter. I do a lot of stuff, you guys.

[36:24.600 --> 36:26.280]  Has the face.
[36:26.680 --> 36:29.000]  Like the snake.
[36:29.360 --> 36:33.400]  In the sun in my disgrace.
[36:33.840 --> 36:35.360]  Boiling heat.

[37:22.970 --> 37:27.970]  Times are gone for honest men.
