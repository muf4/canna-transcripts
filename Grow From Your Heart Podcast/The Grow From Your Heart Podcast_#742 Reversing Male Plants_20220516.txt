[01:52.050 --> 01:55.330]  Welcome to the show everybody I feel like we got all the business out of the way.
[01:55.330 --> 01:57.610]  Let's settle in and hang out and chat a little bit.
[01:57.610 --> 02:01.410]  I'm coming to you on a super warm day here in Colorado.
[02:01.410 --> 02:05.650]  It gives me the idea that it is time to get the outdoor stuff going.
[02:05.650 --> 02:07.890]  I've been excited about the outdoor season.
[02:07.890 --> 02:12.130]  Many of you may know that I do a little bit of a breeding project in a greenhouse.
[02:12.130 --> 02:16.410]  I spent part of today making selections for that outdoor run.
[02:16.410 --> 02:18.970]  I have chosen my male plant for my outdoor run.
[02:18.970 --> 02:22.210]  I have chosen most of the ladies that I want to put out there.
[02:22.210 --> 02:26.450]  And in the next few days those ladies will be put, those ladies and gentlemen will be
[02:26.450 --> 02:29.250]  put in the greenhouse and I am very excited.
[02:29.250 --> 02:31.050]  Big shout out to the greenhouse crew.
[02:31.050 --> 02:32.450]  Hope you are ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32.450 --> 02:33.450]  I hope you are ready.
[02:33.450 --> 02:36.330]  I was going to say I hope you guys are ready but it's guys and gals at the greenhouse.
[02:36.330 --> 02:38.770]  I hope you are ready for another kick ass summer.
[02:38.770 --> 02:39.770]  I am really excited.
[02:39.770 --> 02:43.690]  If you can't tell, making selections for outdoor got me hyped up.
[02:43.690 --> 02:46.810]  It got me excited for the outdoor season for summer to get out there in the greenhouse
[02:46.810 --> 02:47.810]  and play.
[02:47.810 --> 02:50.250]  Get a sunburn, get some sun on my face again.
[02:50.250 --> 02:51.410]  It's going to be a great summer.
[02:51.410 --> 02:52.410]  I am excited.
[02:52.410 --> 02:55.370]  I am not going to tell you the plants that I have chosen and the plants I am going to
[02:55.370 --> 02:56.930]  put outside just yet.
[02:56.930 --> 03:02.230]  Stay tuned in future episodes that will come to light that information will be revealed.
[03:02.230 --> 03:03.230]  But be patient.
[03:03.230 --> 03:04.930]  I am not ready to tell anybody yet.
[03:04.930 --> 03:08.890]  You'll be excited once you start hearing the details of what I am putting outside.
[03:08.890 --> 03:11.970]  Alright that's enough chatter here at the start of the show talking about the greenhouse.
[03:11.970 --> 03:16.050]  I've got a great email here in front of me from a person with a very creative name.
[03:16.050 --> 03:17.050]  We will get to that.
[03:17.050 --> 03:18.770]  Let's do a bit of a recap.
[03:18.770 --> 03:24.130]  On a previous episode, probably three maybe four episodes ago, I did a talk about reversing
[03:24.130 --> 03:29.970]  female plants to make them give us pollen so we can make feminized seeds.
[03:29.970 --> 03:31.650]  A lot of people had a great response to that.
[03:31.650 --> 03:35.050]  A lot of people had a lot of great questions and feedback.
[03:35.050 --> 03:40.250]  One of the questions and comments and pieces of feedback I received the most was can we
[03:40.250 --> 03:45.970]  or could we or may we or what happens if we attempt to reverse a male plant.
[03:45.970 --> 03:51.050]  Can we take a male plant, treat it with a solution and turn it into a female to possibly
[03:51.050 --> 03:56.370]  see what that female plant, that male plant would look like as a female plant.
[03:56.370 --> 03:57.650]  A lot of people asked about that.
[03:57.650 --> 03:59.890]  A lot of people had a lot of great questions.
[03:59.890 --> 04:00.890]  So I do have an email here.
[04:00.890 --> 04:02.170]  We are going to read this one.
[04:02.170 --> 04:07.490]  We will use that as a pivot point, as a segue to discuss reversing a male plant to have
[04:07.490 --> 04:09.210]  it show female sex.
[04:09.210 --> 04:11.770]  The message goes a lot like this.
[04:11.770 --> 04:12.770]  It says, what's up bro?
[04:12.770 --> 04:13.770]  What's up bro?
[04:13.770 --> 04:14.770]  I'm doing good.
[04:14.770 --> 04:15.770]  Hope you're well.
[04:15.770 --> 04:17.930]  Also it says, the last podcast got me thinking.
[04:17.930 --> 04:22.130]  I know obviously two dude plants rubbing wieners together won't make anything.
[04:22.130 --> 04:28.330]  However, is it possible to S1 or R1 cross a male using STS?
[04:28.330 --> 04:32.210]  I'm just thinking it would be an excellent way to somewhat preserve genetics of a breed
[04:32.210 --> 04:38.370]  or male and make some meninized or masculinized seeds or even see what type of female traits
[04:38.530 --> 04:39.730]  the male offers.
[04:39.730 --> 04:41.730]  I don't know if this is even possible.
[04:41.730 --> 04:43.490]  Does this only work for females?
[04:43.490 --> 04:45.530]  I'm just an overthinking stoner.
[04:45.530 --> 04:49.090]  I hope to hear from you or catch this on a podcast one day.
[04:49.090 --> 04:51.970]  Much love from our friend Joe Giz.
[04:51.970 --> 04:53.450]  Big shout out to my buddy Joe Giz.
[04:53.450 --> 04:58.170]  I never really thought I'd say that on the show, but big up for the great question.
[04:58.170 --> 05:00.650]  Hope to hear from you or catch this on the podcast.
[05:00.650 --> 05:02.330]  Well, here you are Mr. Giz.
[05:02.330 --> 05:06.650]  I'm going to answer your question in detail here on the podcast.
[05:06.650 --> 05:12.290]  We can reverse a male plant to show us its potential as a female.
[05:12.290 --> 05:15.410]  The reason we would do that is exactly what I said.
[05:15.410 --> 05:19.970]  We want to see its potential as a female, which would show me what it will deliver to
[05:19.970 --> 05:21.090]  my breeding project.
[05:21.090 --> 05:25.250]  If I take this male plant, turn it into a girl, I've got a good idea of what the girl
[05:25.250 --> 05:28.610]  offspring are going to look like as usable, smokable buds.
[05:28.610 --> 05:33.130]  It's a completely different structure, a completely different idea, a completely different purpose.
[05:33.130 --> 05:36.290]  So I want to take that male plant and turn it into a girl and see what it's going to
[05:36.290 --> 05:37.290]  look like.
[05:37.290 --> 05:40.930]  There are ways to do that that is viable, that is possible.
[05:40.930 --> 05:47.370]  I wouldn't do it, I personally wouldn't do it to show me what that plant possibly may
[05:47.370 --> 05:53.130]  look like as a female because in my theory, in my opinion, in the time it would take a
[05:53.130 --> 06:00.530]  grower to reverse a male plant and turn it to female, I could have grown the male plant
[06:00.530 --> 06:04.970]  and put pollen on a true female and just made a bunch of seeds and then grow those and actually
[06:04.970 --> 06:10.890]  have real viable seeds that will show me what the progeny looks like instead of reversing
[06:10.890 --> 06:11.890]  the male.
[06:11.890 --> 06:16.110]  It takes nearly the same amount of time except I have seeds I have to grow, but it's more
[06:16.110 --> 06:17.110]  fun to me.
[06:17.110 --> 06:18.110]  I get seeds at the end of it.
[06:18.110 --> 06:20.890]  I don't just get one reversed plant that I can't really do anything with because I'm
[06:20.890 --> 06:25.150]  not going to smoke it or consume it because it's been treated and it's been reversed.
[06:25.150 --> 06:29.290]  It's going to show me potentially what it would look like as a female, kind of.
[06:29.290 --> 06:32.810]  It's going to be a little bit wonky.
[06:32.810 --> 06:34.930]  You'll be able to tell that something happened to it.
[06:34.930 --> 06:37.610]  It'll still have an Adam's apple or wide shoulders or something.
[06:37.610 --> 06:41.490]  You'll know, but it will give you an idea of what it's going to look like as a female.
[06:41.490 --> 06:45.530]  So it will work, but in the time it's going to take you to reverse that plant, I've already
[06:45.530 --> 06:50.050]  grown out my male pollinated females and I'm growing out the seeds to see what my breeding
[06:50.050 --> 06:51.050]  project is.
[06:51.050 --> 06:54.290]  I'm already a step ahead of the person who didn't waste time doing that.
[06:54.290 --> 06:55.810]  So it's very possible.
[06:55.810 --> 07:01.330]  The reason that we would do it is, now making male seeds or masculine or meninized seeds,
[07:01.330 --> 07:03.490]  that doesn't really interest me.
[07:03.490 --> 07:05.170]  I wouldn't want to preserve a breed or male.
[07:05.170 --> 07:06.370]  I can make seeds.
[07:06.370 --> 07:08.610]  I know that in a batch of seeds there will be males or females.
[07:08.610 --> 07:12.730]  I know if I've got all females, I can make a male out of that or a pollen donor out of
[07:12.730 --> 07:13.730]  that.
[07:13.730 --> 07:16.450]  So that's not something that gets my attention, but it is possible.
[07:16.450 --> 07:18.890]  It is a viable option for somebody.
[07:18.890 --> 07:24.070]  It's not an avenue that I want to explore, but it is something that could be done.
[07:24.070 --> 07:25.770]  You could make an S1 or R1 cross.
[07:25.770 --> 07:26.890]  Yes, you can do that.
[07:26.890 --> 07:30.690]  Now let's talk about, I've got some notes here on the computer that I want to jump into.
[07:31.690 --> 07:34.090]  So when you reverse the male, it shows it as a female.
[07:34.090 --> 07:35.090]  I said kind of.
[07:35.090 --> 07:39.170]  It gives an idea of its potential, but it only shows what it will look like as a female.
[07:39.170 --> 07:42.090]  It doesn't show what it's going to do in a breeding project.
[07:42.090 --> 07:45.690]  We will see what it looks like as a female, but that doesn't show what's going to pass
[07:45.690 --> 07:47.590]  if we do breeding.
[07:47.590 --> 07:52.330]  We can see that there's this trait and this trait as a female, and we know that it'll
[07:52.330 --> 07:53.330]  express that.
[07:53.330 --> 07:56.290]  But when we breed it to other plants, how much of that stuff moves over?
[07:56.290 --> 07:57.290]  How much of that carries?
[07:57.290 --> 07:59.850]  How much of that is shared into the offspring?
[08:00.010 --> 08:03.850]  Once again, I feel like if I just pollinated and grew out the seeds, I'm getting much more
[08:03.850 --> 08:09.650]  progress, much more details, much more info, a lot more data, because now I know.
[08:09.650 --> 08:12.770]  I always talk about when I pollinate, I never use a male.
[08:12.770 --> 08:15.890]  I rarely use a male to pollinate one plant.
[08:15.890 --> 08:20.210]  Most of the time, if I'm using a boy, he's going to pollinate at least four, six, maybe
[08:20.210 --> 08:25.570]  nine or 10 different girls, because when I grow the seeds from those nine or 10 different
[08:25.570 --> 08:30.930]  girls, I can see what that male is doing amongst a different population of different
[08:30.930 --> 08:31.930]  female plants.
[08:31.930 --> 08:33.690]  If I cross, let's say I take a lemon.
[08:33.690 --> 08:36.690]  We're just going to pick lemon because lemon's a very easy to work with flavor.
[08:36.690 --> 08:41.690]  Take a lemon male and cross it to a strawberry female, a blueberry female, a chocolate female.
[08:41.690 --> 08:44.130]  I don't want to see lemon come out of all these crosses.
[08:44.130 --> 08:46.930]  I want to see a blend of lemon, strawberry, lemonade.
[08:46.930 --> 08:48.450]  I want lemon, blueberry.
[08:48.450 --> 08:50.890]  I want lemon, chocolate or chocolate, lemon.
[08:50.890 --> 08:54.250]  I don't want that lemon to wash over everything.
[08:54.290 --> 08:56.450]  I want to see what the lemon is contributing.
[08:56.450 --> 08:58.810]  So I'm going to mix it to a lot of different other things.
[08:58.810 --> 09:00.610]  Pour that lemon juice on a lot of other things.
[09:00.610 --> 09:02.330]  Taste it, see what works best.
[09:02.330 --> 09:06.930]  If I only cross it to one thing, I don't really, I can see that it got this and this, but is
[09:06.930 --> 09:08.050]  that a one-time thing?
[09:08.050 --> 09:09.050]  Is that an anomaly?
[09:09.050 --> 09:10.610]  Is that what it actually passes?
[09:10.610 --> 09:12.290]  Is that how it, does it play well with others?
[09:12.290 --> 09:13.930]  Does it get along with just that one plant?
[09:13.930 --> 09:15.090]  It's kind of the thing.
[09:15.090 --> 09:17.210]  So I can see that by actually doing the pollination.
[09:17.210 --> 09:18.610]  The reversal is cool.
[09:18.610 --> 09:22.210]  It shows you a lot of cool shit, but we don't see what it does as breeding.
[09:22.210 --> 09:23.250]  So it's fun.
[09:23.250 --> 09:27.010]  It gives you a lot of details, but it's not as effective as I would want it to be for
[09:27.010 --> 09:33.850]  the amount of time, effort, energy and expense, which it takes me to do that project.
[09:33.850 --> 09:37.790]  Making a plant show, reverse and show its potential probably takes longer than breeding
[09:37.790 --> 09:41.290]  it and growing out those seeds from multiple females is what I wrote in my notes.
[09:41.290 --> 09:43.590]  I'm just covering the notes to make sure I get all the stuff here.
[09:43.590 --> 09:49.050]  So one thing I should definitely cover and talk about is we're doing something different
[09:49.050 --> 09:54.570]  when we are reversing, when we are attempting to reverse the male plant compared to when
[09:54.570 --> 09:56.770]  we are reversing the female.
[09:56.770 --> 09:59.170]  So that means we need a different solution.
[09:59.170 --> 10:02.090]  We want to do basically the opposite.
[10:02.090 --> 10:06.150]  When we are making fems, we want to stop the ethylene production.
[10:06.150 --> 10:12.010]  When we are reversing a female to make it a male or reversing a male to make it a female,
[10:12.010 --> 10:14.050]  see I'm even getting confused on all this new stuff.
[10:14.050 --> 10:15.730]  The future is weird, you guys.
[10:15.730 --> 10:20.070]  When we are making fem seeds, we want to stop the ethylene production.
[10:20.070 --> 10:23.930]  When we are doing the opposite, we want to encourage and promote that ethylene production
[10:23.930 --> 10:26.010]  and do things a little bit differently.
[10:26.010 --> 10:30.530]  So we use a different chemical or a different solution for this project.
[10:30.530 --> 10:37.130]  We use a chemical or a product called Ethafon and it's spelled E-T-H-A-P-H-O-N.
[10:37.130 --> 10:40.930]  Ethafon is what I believe the product is called, the chemical is called.
[10:40.930 --> 10:46.210]  I use that product to reverse the male plant to show it's female sex.
[10:46.210 --> 10:50.270]  The product that you would buy is called Ethafon 2SL.
[10:50.270 --> 10:53.210]  If you're shopping, if you're going to do it, that's the product you need.
[10:53.210 --> 10:54.950]  Here I go with my rant.
[10:54.950 --> 10:59.130]  If you are going to play with any chemicals, if you're going to apply any products, read
[10:59.130 --> 11:03.050]  the labels, read the manuals, read the safety data sheets.
[11:03.050 --> 11:07.850]  Also after that, wear all of the recommended and required personal protective equipment.
[11:07.850 --> 11:11.850]  If you get hurt, if you get sick, if you go blind, if you fuck up and do something
[11:11.850 --> 11:15.650]  wrong, I am not responsible for your dipshittery.
[11:15.650 --> 11:19.330]  I'm telling you right now, read the fucking label, wear the protective equipment.
[11:19.330 --> 11:24.330]  If you hurt yourself, make yourself sick, fuck up some plants, have a bad time, not
[11:24.330 --> 11:25.330]  my fault bro.
[11:25.330 --> 11:29.770]  I'm telling you, read the label, do shit correctly, do shit carefully.
[11:29.770 --> 11:33.170]  When you're mixing, when you're applying, have gloves, have goggles.
[11:33.170 --> 11:35.930]  If it recommends anything else, wear that stuff.
[11:35.930 --> 11:39.650]  When you were spraying the plant, remove that one plant from the grow environment,
[11:39.650 --> 11:44.510]  put it in a safe place, spray the one plant, wait till it dries, then put that plant back
[11:44.510 --> 11:48.390]  in the rest of the environment or you will run the risk of getting the other plants a
[11:48.390 --> 11:50.970]  reversal spray on accident.
[11:50.970 --> 11:54.970]  Those other plants didn't sign up for a sex change, let's not do that to them.
[11:54.970 --> 11:57.990]  The product you want is Ethafon 2SL.
[11:57.990 --> 12:00.130]  Be very careful when you were using it.
[12:00.130 --> 12:06.010]  Apply it to the plant, to where it's dripping off but not fucking soaking off the plant.
[12:06.010 --> 12:09.290]  You want it kind of saturated but you don't want it raining off because then too much
[12:09.290 --> 12:10.290]  of it falls off.
[12:10.290 --> 12:12.730]  You want it to stay on the leaf.
[12:12.730 --> 12:18.010]  Possibly consider using a wetting agent, a sticker, a spreader sticker to keep that on
[12:18.010 --> 12:19.650]  to the plant a little bit better.
[12:19.650 --> 12:24.250]  Also don't just spray the leaves, spray the stems and the stalks as well.
[12:24.250 --> 12:28.610]  Get the plant fully wet with the Ethafon 2SL spray.
[12:28.610 --> 12:30.450]  Now let's talk about dilutions.
[12:30.450 --> 12:31.970]  I use very little.
[12:31.970 --> 12:36.210]  Too much of this stuff and the plants go and they just start twisting up and they start
[12:36.210 --> 12:40.370]  getting weird crazy arms and they start showing you that they are pissed off.
[12:40.370 --> 12:45.890]  I recommend you start with approximately a 1 to 100 ratio.
[12:45.890 --> 12:53.490]  That's right, 1 milliliter of Ethafon 2SL to 199 milliliters of distilled water.
[12:53.490 --> 12:56.370]  So it's a 1 to...I do 1 and 100 milliliters.
[12:56.370 --> 12:58.730]  So 1 to 100 ratio.
[12:58.730 --> 13:03.370]  Maybe even a half or .7 of a milliliter if you can measure that small.
[13:03.370 --> 13:06.370]  I don't have a device to measure that small.
[13:06.370 --> 13:10.250]  Maybe you quantify it, go bigger, do a lot of water and then more of the Ethafon so you
[13:10.250 --> 13:11.530]  can do the math.
[13:11.530 --> 13:17.470]  But about half to 1 milliliter per 100 milliliters of water is enough.
[13:17.470 --> 13:20.090]  More than that and the plants will get pissed off.
[13:20.090 --> 13:23.490]  I don't have enough experience with this to give you a lot of details.
[13:23.490 --> 13:24.490]  I've done this.
[13:24.490 --> 13:25.930]  I can't say I did this.
[13:25.930 --> 13:27.570]  I was involved with this project.
[13:27.570 --> 13:29.250]  I did this with somebody else.
[13:29.250 --> 13:32.570]  I was kind of the...I was the one watching and taking notes.
[13:32.570 --> 13:35.930]  We were doing it together but they were much more excited about it so I just kind of observed
[13:35.930 --> 13:37.170]  and I was there.
[13:37.170 --> 13:39.730]  But we did it with the Ethafon 2SL.
[13:39.730 --> 13:41.130]  We sprayed multiple plants.
[13:41.130 --> 13:44.210]  A lot of them crinkled up, curled, went to shit.
[13:44.210 --> 13:46.090]  Some of them can take it very well.
[13:46.090 --> 13:50.530]  We noticed it is ratio dependent, also very strain dependent.
[13:50.530 --> 13:54.570]  And the plants look ugly as hell once they are transitioning to females.
[13:54.570 --> 13:57.010]  They're not attractive in any way, shape or form.
[13:57.010 --> 13:59.810]  Once they finish up they get kind of weird, kind of strange.
[13:59.810 --> 14:05.210]  And if you don't spray one time with Ethafon, I've learned that one spray of Ethafon will
[14:05.210 --> 14:06.210]  do it.
[14:06.210 --> 14:09.890]  If you spray too many times they definitely freak out later and flower.
[14:09.890 --> 14:12.890]  Alright, that is all I've got for you with reversing males.
[14:12.890 --> 14:15.850]  That is all the experience, all the info, all the data that I've got.
[14:15.850 --> 14:16.850]  It does work.
[14:16.850 --> 14:17.850]  It is possible.
[14:17.850 --> 14:23.170]  However, I don't find it to be useful because I can get more data, in my opinion, from just
[14:23.250 --> 14:25.570]  breeding that plant to females.
[14:25.570 --> 14:28.250]  I get more feedback, more data, and I get seeds.
[14:28.250 --> 14:31.970]  If I'm just reversing it, I don't have shit to show for my work except for some half-assed
[14:31.970 --> 14:32.970]  data.
[14:32.970 --> 14:33.970]  That is my opinion.
[14:33.970 --> 14:34.970]  It does work.
[14:34.970 --> 14:36.690]  It will show you potential.
[14:36.690 --> 14:37.810]  We use a different solution.
[14:37.810 --> 14:40.010]  We use the Ethafon 2SL.
[14:40.010 --> 14:42.850]  I apply it at a 1 to 100 ratio.
[14:42.850 --> 14:44.810]  I apply it one time.
[14:44.810 --> 14:48.970]  The day we put the plants into flower, that's all it needs and it should work.
[14:48.970 --> 14:49.970]  That's all I've got for you.
[14:49.970 --> 14:52.890]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments or concerns, you know that I would love to
[14:53.610 --> 14:54.610]  hear from you.
[14:54.610 --> 14:55.610]  The email address is growfromyourheart.com.
[14:55.610 --> 14:56.610]  Don't be shy.
[14:56.610 --> 14:58.610]  Let's keep this conversation going.
[14:58.610 --> 15:02.810]  If you have reversed a male to show its potential as a female, send me pictures.
[15:02.810 --> 15:04.530]  Send me stories of your experience.
[15:04.530 --> 15:06.110]  We'll talk about it more on the show.
[15:06.110 --> 15:08.570]  If you have more questions like this, I would love to hear from you.
[15:08.570 --> 15:12.570]  Of course, the email address is growfromyourheart.com.
[15:12.570 --> 15:13.570]  Don't be shy.
[15:13.570 --> 15:18.610]  Also, don't forget about the Patreon campaign at patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[15:18.610 --> 15:22.850]  Once again, everything is on my website, iregenetics.com.
[15:23.010 --> 15:24.770]  Sometimes I talk a little bit fast.
[15:24.770 --> 15:26.250]  Sometimes people miss stuff.
[15:26.250 --> 15:31.530]  Everything you could possibly imagine is on the website, iregenetics.com.
[15:31.530 --> 15:35.370]  This is going to be a quick episode, short and sweet, nice and to the point.
[15:35.370 --> 15:36.370]  Sometimes that's all we need.
[15:36.370 --> 15:39.210]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[15:39.210 --> 15:42.690]  I want to give a giant shout out to my friends at Lollipop Farms.
[15:42.690 --> 15:45.770]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
