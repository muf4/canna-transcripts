[01:39.170 --> 01:42.250]  it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:42.970 --> 01:45.170]  Alright let's jump right into this episode.
[01:45.170 --> 01:48.050]  I want to talk about storing our seeds.
[01:48.050 --> 01:52.330]  In a few previous episodes I've taught you how to make silver thiosulfate solution.
[01:52.330 --> 01:56.930]  I taught you when to pollinate, how to pollinate, how to pollinate, how to apply the pollen,
[01:56.930 --> 01:58.290]  how to store the pollen.
[01:58.290 --> 02:00.410]  We've gotten all the way up to making seeds.
[02:00.410 --> 02:01.810]  We have harvested seeds.
[02:01.810 --> 02:04.170]  Now let's talk about what do we do with those seeds.
[02:04.170 --> 02:07.010]  The first answer is going to be grow them.
[02:07.010 --> 02:10.730]  As a seed breeder my favorite thing to do with new seeds is to grow them.
[02:10.730 --> 02:14.730]  As a seed breeder who made new seeds and sent them out to my friends I want you to
[02:14.730 --> 02:15.730]  grow them.
[02:15.730 --> 02:20.370]  The worst thing for a seed breeder to see is seeds in a box, in a vault, in a drawer
[02:20.370 --> 02:22.850]  not getting grown, not getting any attention.
[02:22.850 --> 02:24.970]  We want those in the dirt.
[02:24.970 --> 02:29.570]  On the websites, on the packages it says that it may be illegal to germinate them in your
[02:29.570 --> 02:30.570]  area.
[02:30.570 --> 02:34.970]  It may be a souvenir but deep down inside we really wish that you would grow the shit
[02:34.970 --> 02:37.170]  out of those and send us a bunch of pictures.
[02:37.170 --> 02:38.170]  That's what we want.
[02:38.970 --> 02:41.930]  After you've made seeds the next thing to do is to grow them.
[02:41.930 --> 02:43.770]  Of course sometimes you can't do that.
[02:43.770 --> 02:46.930]  I make more seeds than I could possibly grow in my lifetime.
[02:46.930 --> 02:51.130]  I've got an army of testers, a gang of friends out there just growing seeds for me.
[02:51.130 --> 02:53.530]  So the most, the best thing to do is to grow them.
[02:53.530 --> 02:54.890]  I understand you can't grow all of them.
[02:54.890 --> 02:56.770]  You've got to store some of them.
[02:56.770 --> 02:58.610]  Let's talk about storing our seeds.
[02:58.610 --> 03:03.650]  Let's back up to the point of just before getting the seeds into packages we'll talk
[03:03.650 --> 03:05.830]  a little bit about harvesting them.
[03:05.830 --> 03:10.710]  Before we can even think about storing these seeds in any way they need to be completely
[03:10.710 --> 03:11.710]  dry.
[03:11.710 --> 03:14.430]  I've said the words dry, dry, dry, dry.
[03:14.430 --> 03:18.390]  I've said those words so many times while talking about storing pollen, while talking
[03:18.390 --> 03:21.430]  about harvesting, while talking about storing seeds.
[03:21.430 --> 03:23.510]  Dryness is very important when it comes to storage.
[03:23.510 --> 03:24.990]  We don't want our weeds super dry.
[03:24.990 --> 03:26.150]  We don't want our buds dry.
[03:26.150 --> 03:28.350]  That's why we do a slow dry and cure.
[03:28.350 --> 03:31.430]  But for seeds, for pollen we need that stuff super dry.
[03:31.430 --> 03:34.270]  Moisture is your worst nightmare for seeds and pollen.
[03:34.270 --> 03:38.990]  So keep that in mind throughout this entire process that moisture is your worst nightmare.
[03:38.990 --> 03:41.750]  Also seeds don't like drastic temperature changes.
[03:41.750 --> 03:46.030]  We will talk about that more, but let's talk about getting the seeds from the buds.
[03:46.030 --> 03:49.710]  Just in case you missed the harvest episode, let's get the seeds from the buds.
[03:49.710 --> 03:52.430]  We want the buds super dry.
[03:52.430 --> 03:57.310]  A lot of people have this idea that seeds need to be wintered or frozen or cold over
[03:57.310 --> 03:58.830]  a season or something like that.
[03:58.830 --> 03:59.830]  That is not accurate.
[03:59.990 --> 04:04.350]  I talked about in a previous episode that I've seen seeds germinate inside the plant,
[04:04.350 --> 04:06.830]  which tells me they don't need any time to wait.
[04:06.830 --> 04:09.510]  Once they're ready, once they're ripe, they are viable.
[04:09.510 --> 04:10.510]  They're powerful seeds.
[04:10.510 --> 04:11.510]  They're potent.
[04:11.510 --> 04:12.510]  They're vigorous.
[04:12.510 --> 04:13.510]  They're ready to go.
[04:13.510 --> 04:17.510]  So moisture can cause that to happen inside of the wet buds.
[04:17.510 --> 04:21.870]  If we were to store wet seeds or wet buds or wet pollen into a container and seal it
[04:21.870 --> 04:25.710]  up and just ignore it, it will definitely create a moldy environment, which will ruin
[04:25.710 --> 04:26.710]  your product.
[04:26.710 --> 04:28.430]  So let's get this product super dry.
[04:28.430 --> 04:29.590]  I like to get the seeds dry.
[04:30.350 --> 04:34.190]  I like to get the product bone dry before I start packaging it up in any way.
[04:34.190 --> 04:37.270]  It sits out wide open until I'm confident in the dryness.
[04:37.270 --> 04:38.990]  I'm going to say dry a lot.
[04:38.990 --> 04:42.230]  I'm also going to talk about desiccant packages.
[04:42.230 --> 04:43.470]  I'm looking at some on my table.
[04:43.470 --> 04:45.390]  I've got a little bag of them over there.
[04:45.390 --> 04:49.350]  Do not confuse the desiccant packs with a Boveda pack.
[04:49.350 --> 04:51.350]  We're trying to suck out moisture.
[04:51.350 --> 04:54.710]  The Boveda pack, the other humidipacks, those add moisture.
[04:54.710 --> 04:55.710]  We don't want to do that.
[04:55.710 --> 04:57.030]  We want to remove it all.
[04:57.030 --> 04:58.390]  We don't want to regulate it.
[04:58.390 --> 04:59.550]  We want to eliminate it.
[04:59.550 --> 05:01.350]  So don't get confused on the packets.
[05:01.350 --> 05:03.470]  Get the appropriate packet.
[05:03.470 --> 05:08.310]  Desiccant pack, dryness pack, that's what we're looking for, not a moisture packet once
[05:08.310 --> 05:09.310]  again.
[05:09.310 --> 05:10.310]  So get the buds super dry.
[05:10.310 --> 05:14.110]  The way I like to do it, I've talked about this before, I get my plants, my buds are
[05:14.110 --> 05:18.590]  completely dry and I'll put them in a bin, maybe a five gallon bucket, maybe a Sterlite
[05:18.590 --> 05:19.590]  bin.
[05:19.590 --> 05:20.910]  I'll put on gloves, I'll crumble it up.
[05:20.910 --> 05:21.910]  Maybe I'll use another method.
[05:21.910 --> 05:22.910]  I've talked about this.
[05:22.910 --> 05:23.990]  Get it dry.
[05:23.990 --> 05:25.390]  Remove the seeds from that material.
[05:25.390 --> 05:26.670]  We want it super dry.
[05:26.670 --> 05:29.710]  This is where we're going to start talking about storing the seeds.
[05:29.710 --> 05:31.230]  They are super dry.
[05:31.230 --> 05:32.830]  Put them in a container.
[05:32.830 --> 05:35.710]  If I've got a lot of seeds, I will use a small mason jar.
[05:35.710 --> 05:39.390]  If I've got just a number of seeds that I know won't last very long, I put them in a
[05:39.390 --> 05:41.710]  three by three jewelry baggie.
[05:41.710 --> 05:42.710]  It's just a baggie.
[05:42.710 --> 05:43.710]  I get them online.
[05:43.710 --> 05:45.990]  They come from Hobby Lobby or Amazon.
[05:45.990 --> 05:47.090]  Three by three square bag.
[05:47.090 --> 05:51.750]  If you buy seeds from me in the regular packages, that's what I'm talking about, one of those
[05:51.750 --> 05:52.870]  baggies.
[05:53.110 --> 05:57.350]  Depending on how many I have, I either use a glass jar, maybe I'll use a smaller glass
[05:57.350 --> 06:00.390]  vial or oftentimes that three by three baggie.
[06:00.390 --> 06:05.550]  Get the seeds dry, then put them in the container which you wish to store them in.
[06:05.550 --> 06:07.670]  Eventually they need to go into something that is light proof.
[06:07.670 --> 06:09.550]  I just said I put them in those baggies.
[06:09.550 --> 06:12.790]  They also go into another container for storage which is dark.
[06:12.790 --> 06:17.270]  Your container, you may want to choose something that is opaque or what's the word, that is
[06:17.270 --> 06:18.790]  dark that will keep the light out.
[06:18.790 --> 06:22.650]  You want something colored or tinted or eventually it should go into that.
[06:23.430 --> 06:28.090]  We want to store our seeds in a package that we can make, try to make airtight and keep
[06:28.090 --> 06:29.090]  the light out.
[06:29.090 --> 06:33.010]  Then we want to put that in somewhere that is cool, dry and dark.
[06:33.010 --> 06:35.150]  We don't want to get temperature swings.
[06:35.150 --> 06:36.570]  We don't want to get light on these plants.
[06:36.570 --> 06:37.570]  We don't want extreme heat.
[06:37.570 --> 06:39.450]  We don't want extreme cold.
[06:39.450 --> 06:43.270]  Put your seeds in a container, whether a jar, a baggie, a vial.
[06:43.270 --> 06:48.570]  Then a huge piece of advice, label them very excessively clearly.
[06:48.570 --> 06:50.370]  I put the cross.
[06:50.570 --> 06:53.970]  I'm going to package up some Arise F1 seeds.
[06:53.970 --> 06:57.210]  I would label at the top, I would say Arise F1.
[06:57.210 --> 06:59.970]  Then it would say Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[06:59.970 --> 07:02.970]  Then it would have the date that those seeds were packaged up.
[07:02.970 --> 07:03.970]  Today is March something-teth.
[07:03.970 --> 07:09.690]  We would put March something-teenth on that package so that it would say Arise F1 so I
[07:09.690 --> 07:11.410]  know which filial generation.
[07:11.410 --> 07:15.130]  I remember what the cross is there just for a backup plan in case I don't remember what
[07:15.130 --> 07:18.970]  Arise was or if I was high when I wrote something down, I have another backup plan.
[07:18.970 --> 07:19.970]  Then I've got a date.
[07:20.570 --> 07:23.050]  So when I know when those seeds were kind of harvested, when I put them in that baggie
[07:23.050 --> 07:24.650]  is a good enough time frame for me.
[07:24.650 --> 07:26.610]  It lets me know which batch they were from.
[07:26.610 --> 07:30.510]  That way if you guys have a problem, if I discover a problem, I know that this jar,
[07:30.510 --> 07:32.810]  this bag of seeds is where the problem lies.
[07:32.810 --> 07:35.650]  We can crack that open, germ a bunch of those and see what happens in there.
[07:35.650 --> 07:40.090]  So clearly, excessively label your seeds.
[07:40.090 --> 07:45.270]  I like to put, like I said, the name of the cross, the cross, the date.
[07:45.270 --> 07:47.030]  Sometimes I know how many seeds are in there.
[07:47.030 --> 07:48.030]  Sometimes I'll do that.
[07:48.090 --> 07:51.470]  If it's got some special notes on it, maybe I'll write that on the packaging.
[07:51.470 --> 07:56.670]  So label them, put them in a jar, put them in a bag, put a desiccant pack in there, something
[07:56.670 --> 07:57.950]  that will suck up the moisture.
[07:57.950 --> 07:59.790]  I'm going to keep saying dry.
[07:59.790 --> 08:01.270]  You want the seeds dry.
[08:01.270 --> 08:03.490]  Moisture is a nightmare for a seed.
[08:03.490 --> 08:04.690]  Moisture will ruin the seed.
[08:04.690 --> 08:08.430]  Moisture will make the seed grow and until you're ready, don't get it wet.
[08:08.430 --> 08:12.830]  So put it in a jar, put it in a bag with your desiccant pack.
[08:12.830 --> 08:15.710]  Now let's keep the temperatures consistent.
[08:15.710 --> 08:17.350]  Cool is better.
[08:17.350 --> 08:18.770]  Consistent is not ideal.
[08:18.770 --> 08:20.550]  Hot is not good at all.
[08:20.550 --> 08:24.790]  I like to store my seeds in a cool, dry, dark environment.
[08:24.790 --> 08:26.190]  I don't want the seeds really cold.
[08:26.190 --> 08:27.670]  I don't want them really hot.
[08:27.670 --> 08:31.830]  Basically, if I am comfortable, those seeds are probably comfortable as well.
[08:31.830 --> 08:36.550]  Maybe a little bit colder than room temperature, maybe low 70s, high 60s would be good for
[08:36.550 --> 08:38.230]  storing your seeds.
[08:38.230 --> 08:40.430]  Some people like to keep them in the refrigerator.
[08:40.430 --> 08:42.550]  Let's talk about that for a little bit.
[08:42.550 --> 08:44.870]  Cool is good, but I don't like to freeze them.
[08:44.870 --> 08:46.990]  The refrigerator would be cool.
[08:47.630 --> 08:52.670]  If you put them in your jar or a baggie, then I put mine inside of a Grateful Dead lunchbox.
[08:52.670 --> 08:54.110]  I know that sounds fucking cliche.
[08:54.110 --> 08:58.590]  The white hippie with dreadlocks keeps his magic beans in a Grateful Dead lunchbox in
[08:58.590 --> 08:59.590]  the refrigerator.
[08:59.590 --> 09:01.870]  Yes, it's one of those metal lunchboxes.
[09:01.870 --> 09:03.510]  It's got the little metal clasp on the front.
[09:03.510 --> 09:04.510]  You pop it open.
[09:04.510 --> 09:06.590]  There's a shit ton of seed packs in there.
[09:06.590 --> 09:08.310]  Close it back up, throw it in the fridge.
[09:08.310 --> 09:09.590]  It stays in the crisper drawer.
[09:09.590 --> 09:11.150]  That's mainly where I keep those seeds.
[09:11.150 --> 09:12.150]  Don't come to get it.
[09:12.150 --> 09:13.710]  They are well protected.
[09:13.710 --> 09:16.310]  But the seeds, my seeds tend to stay in the crisper drawer.
[09:17.070 --> 09:21.830]  There may also be a safe somewhere that is in a cool, dark place that does not get a
[09:21.830 --> 09:23.350]  lot of temperature swings.
[09:23.350 --> 09:24.830]  A lot of the seeds stay in the safe.
[09:24.830 --> 09:26.110]  The safe is always dark.
[09:26.110 --> 09:29.590]  The temperature there is basically always the same because of the location.
[09:29.590 --> 09:32.670]  Keep it in a place where you can keep the temperature kind of regulated.
[09:32.670 --> 09:38.190]  Let's talk about why the temperature is important and why I don't like the freezer and why possibly
[09:38.190 --> 09:41.710]  the refrigerator may not be the choice for you.
[09:41.750 --> 09:47.150]  If you are the kind of person that likes to open and close your seeds and show your friends
[09:47.150 --> 09:52.310]  all your packages, the fridge or the freezer is not the spot because think about what happens
[09:52.310 --> 09:55.910]  if you put a food product in the refrigerator and then you take it out.
[09:55.910 --> 09:58.390]  It develops condensation on the outside of the package.
[09:58.390 --> 10:01.430]  I was looking at one of my drinks here to see if it was, it's too, the temperature is
[10:01.430 --> 10:02.430]  just right in this room.
[10:02.430 --> 10:04.110]  There's no condensation.
[10:04.110 --> 10:07.270]  So when you take a drink out of the fridge, right, there's no condensation on your bottle.
[10:07.270 --> 10:09.830]  You take that bottle out of the fridge, you crack it open, take a few drinks.
[10:09.830 --> 10:11.290]  You go to grab the bottle again.
[10:11.290 --> 10:13.770]  It's got condensation on it.
[10:13.770 --> 10:17.890]  Maybe possibly that could happen to our seeds if we put them in the fridge, get them nice
[10:17.890 --> 10:20.650]  and cold, pull them out, show them off to your friends.
[10:20.650 --> 10:24.490]  They may be getting exposed to condensation or moisture within that packaging.
[10:24.490 --> 10:26.130]  There could be moisture in the package.
[10:26.130 --> 10:28.050]  I don't know how dry your seeds were.
[10:28.050 --> 10:30.210]  I don't know who sold them to you, who packaged them.
[10:30.210 --> 10:33.890]  I don't know the moisture content of your seeds before they were packaged.
[10:33.890 --> 10:38.090]  In the fridge, that moisture could become condensation when you take it out.
[10:38.090 --> 10:40.170]  That could be detrimental to your seeds.
[10:40.170 --> 10:43.450]  In the freezer, that moisture could rupture your seeds.
[10:43.450 --> 10:47.530]  If there's enough moisture with the inside of that seed and it does freeze, if it reaches
[10:47.530 --> 10:51.050]  a certain temperature, that could explode and pop the seed.
[10:51.050 --> 10:56.770]  I have seen seeds allegedly get shipped from Colorado to New York in the winter.
[10:56.770 --> 10:59.330]  They exploded in the bay of the fucking cargo plane.
[10:59.330 --> 11:00.950]  All the seeds were ruptured.
[11:00.950 --> 11:02.290]  They had too much moisture in them.
[11:02.290 --> 11:03.350]  It was winter.
[11:03.350 --> 11:06.010]  They popped inside there like fucking bubble wrap and popcorn.
[11:06.010 --> 11:07.510]  Most of those seeds were toasted.
[11:07.510 --> 11:08.510]  They were toasted.
[11:08.510 --> 11:09.510]  They were opposite of toasted.
[11:09.850 --> 11:11.790]  They were frozen to shit.
[11:11.790 --> 11:15.430]  If you're going to put the seeds in the fridge, leave them there until it's time to grow them.
[11:15.430 --> 11:16.870]  Don't be the person.
[11:16.870 --> 11:17.870]  It's okay.
[11:17.870 --> 11:19.370]  I love to marvel at my seed collection.
[11:19.370 --> 11:22.030]  I've got some seeds and I'll pull them out and I'll look at them and be like, oh, there's
[11:22.030 --> 11:26.470]  my ... I've got all of the Subcool stuff, all of the TGA stuff from before Subcool passed.
[11:26.470 --> 11:29.790]  I'll pull it out and just look at it and just read the names and look at all the cool shit
[11:29.790 --> 11:30.790]  that I've gotten.
[11:30.790 --> 11:31.790]  Miss my buddy Sub.
[11:31.790 --> 11:34.750]  It's like looking at your baseball cards or your sneaker collection or whatever you're
[11:34.750 --> 11:39.150]  into, your video games or your hats or whatever you're into, your purses, if that's your thing.
[11:39.290 --> 11:42.790]  A lot of people like to look at their collection and share it and show their friends and the
[11:42.790 --> 11:46.630]  bros come over and you're like, I got this and I got, oh yeah, I got this from this company
[11:46.630 --> 11:50.150]  and I got this and you just show it off and maybe you're doing trading or whatever.
[11:50.150 --> 11:52.790]  If you're going to do that and bring them out a lot, don't put them in the fridge because
[11:52.790 --> 11:57.950]  then you do run that risk, that opportunity, that potential for compensation every time
[11:57.950 --> 11:58.950]  you move them.
[11:58.950 --> 12:02.630]  Every time you take them out, put them back in, you do give them that opportunity.
[12:02.630 --> 12:05.650]  Also you're making heat and cold fluctuations.
[12:05.650 --> 12:06.730]  That's going to cause problems.
[12:06.730 --> 12:09.210]  It's a living organism that you're trying to preserve.
[12:09.210 --> 12:12.250]  When it gets warm, it's probably going to start thinking, oh, we're going to germinate.
[12:12.250 --> 12:13.250]  We're going to get going.
[12:13.250 --> 12:15.530]  Then you put it back in the fridge and confuse the shit out of it.
[12:15.530 --> 12:17.050]  I don't know if that's real.
[12:17.050 --> 12:20.770]  I don't know if it's got that kind of memory, but that is something that I would think about.
[12:20.770 --> 12:22.250]  Try to keep your temperature consistent.
[12:22.250 --> 12:26.410]  No spikes, no humidity spikes, definitely no condensation, no moisture.
[12:26.410 --> 12:30.650]  Again, I would not recommend freezing them, but a lot of people do that and it does work.
[12:30.650 --> 12:37.450]  I've stored seeds for years in this method, in a baggie, in the lunchbox, in the crisper
[12:37.450 --> 12:38.450]  drawer of the fridge.
[12:38.450 --> 12:40.050]  I've had seeds in there for a long time.
[12:40.050 --> 12:41.050]  I bust them out.
[12:41.050 --> 12:44.770]  They germinate very well, so that seems to be a good method for me.
[12:44.770 --> 12:48.270]  If you are one of those people that insists on showing your seeds to all of your friends
[12:48.270 --> 12:52.810]  and you want to store them in your refrigerator, this may be a better way to do things anyway
[12:52.810 --> 12:58.770]  just because it just adds a level of security to yourself and your collection and also it
[12:58.810 --> 13:02.690]  keeps your friends honest and it doesn't allow for any questions.
[13:02.690 --> 13:06.850]  Maybe consider just taking all of your seeds one time and making a fat list of them and
[13:06.850 --> 13:08.530]  saying like categorize them.
[13:08.530 --> 13:09.530]  I read genetics.
[13:09.530 --> 13:10.530]  I've got all of this.
[13:10.530 --> 13:12.770]  Miss Jill, I've got all of this.
[13:12.770 --> 13:16.690]  Whatever other brands and breeders you're into, make a breeder and then list all the
[13:16.690 --> 13:20.690]  shit you've got from them and then maybe put regs and fems and then how many seeds are
[13:20.690 --> 13:21.690]  in each pack.
[13:21.690 --> 13:23.090]  Get real OCD about it if you want to.
[13:23.090 --> 13:26.850]  Then when it comes time to show off your trading or your seeds or talk about trading, you don't
[13:26.850 --> 13:28.690]  have to bring out the stash and show everybody.
[13:28.730 --> 13:33.690]  You just show them the list or take pictures of all your cool shit and show everybody your
[13:33.690 --> 13:34.690]  pictures.
[13:34.690 --> 13:38.690]  That way, once again, when it comes time to trade or sell seeds, you don't have to bring
[13:38.690 --> 13:40.210]  it all out.
[13:40.210 --> 13:41.650]  Things can't disappear.
[13:41.650 --> 13:43.130]  Things can't walk away.
[13:43.130 --> 13:46.470]  People can't accidentally take a pack that they didn't trade for if you only give them
[13:46.470 --> 13:48.370]  a picture of what you've got available.
[13:48.370 --> 13:52.610]  I'm not saying your friends are going to steal from you, but who knows?
[13:52.610 --> 13:54.170]  One time somebody stole some seeds from me.
[13:54.170 --> 13:55.170]  I know who you are, motherfucker.
[13:55.170 --> 13:56.170]  Guess what?
[13:56.170 --> 13:57.170]  I don't call you no more.
[13:57.170 --> 13:58.170]  I didn't say anything about it.
[13:58.650 --> 13:59.650]  I hope you don't hang out.
[13:59.650 --> 14:02.650]  I hope the seeds was worth it because in the long run, dude, you would have made so much
[14:02.650 --> 14:05.370]  fucking more money than stealing a fucking pack of seeds from me.
[14:05.370 --> 14:06.370]  But guess what?
[14:06.370 --> 14:07.370]  You're not on the team.
[14:07.370 --> 14:08.370]  All right.
[14:08.370 --> 14:10.130]  So where do we go from there?
[14:10.130 --> 14:11.250]  I really don't have a lot more notes.
[14:11.250 --> 14:13.850]  I think I've covered the basics of storing seeds.
[14:13.850 --> 14:16.370]  Keep them in a cool, dry, dark place.
[14:16.370 --> 14:17.850]  Somewhere secure, somewhere safe.
[14:17.850 --> 14:18.850]  Seeds are valuable.
[14:18.850 --> 14:20.010]  You guys work hard for your money.
[14:20.010 --> 14:21.150]  I recommend a safe.
[14:21.150 --> 14:25.010]  If you've got a metal gun safe or something like that, that is a great spot.
[14:25.010 --> 14:26.010]  Lock them up.
[14:26.010 --> 14:28.330]  Your lock and key is the best place.
[14:28.330 --> 14:29.610]  Don't bring them all out.
[14:29.610 --> 14:31.250]  Don't tell people where you're keeping them.
[14:31.250 --> 14:32.470]  That is my advice.
[14:32.470 --> 14:33.810]  Take a lot of pictures of your seed packs.
[14:33.810 --> 14:37.290]  That way, if you want to share it with your friends, you got all the pictures there.
[14:37.290 --> 14:38.290]  You remember what you've got.
[14:38.290 --> 14:40.810]  You don't have to pull it out of the stash all the time.
[14:40.810 --> 14:42.250]  Document what you've got.
[14:42.250 --> 14:46.370]  Write down on the seed packs maybe if they're packs you bought, if they're seeds you made,
[14:46.370 --> 14:48.570]  write down the date on that package when you got it.
[14:48.570 --> 14:52.450]  If you're making a spreadsheet, when you got those, put a date on there so that you know
[14:52.450 --> 14:54.050]  how old those seeds are.
[14:54.090 --> 14:56.410]  Also maybe write down where you got them.
[14:56.410 --> 15:00.930]  There are some vendors that do have older seeds, some vendors with newer seeds.
[15:00.930 --> 15:04.410]  Unfortunately, there are some vendors with fugazi seeds.
[15:04.410 --> 15:07.690]  People are buying just buckets of seeds or people are just making seeds.
[15:07.690 --> 15:12.310]  It wouldn't stop anybody, a seed company, a seed bank.
[15:12.310 --> 15:14.050]  The banks are the people that sell the seeds.
[15:14.050 --> 15:16.530]  The breeders are the people that make them.
[15:16.530 --> 15:17.770]  A company makes them.
[15:17.770 --> 15:20.850]  The banks sell them.
[15:20.850 --> 15:24.530]  There's nothing stopping from somebody making a bucket of seeds and just putting them in
[15:24.530 --> 15:26.930]  packages and saying that these are this brand seeds.
[15:26.930 --> 15:28.410]  We've seen it done.
[15:28.410 --> 15:30.010]  There's a company that's done it to Miss Jill.
[15:30.010 --> 15:31.010]  They've done it to myself.
[15:31.010 --> 15:33.050]  They've done it to a lot of the people in the industry.
[15:33.050 --> 15:37.210]  They claim to be selling IRI Genetics or Miss Jill Genetics and it's honestly just shit
[15:37.210 --> 15:39.890]  that they made and they have no idea what the seeds really are.
[15:39.890 --> 15:41.410]  They just package it up and they sell it.
[15:41.410 --> 15:44.570]  Then the consumer buys it and they send me an email saying, hey, I bought seeds from
[15:44.570 --> 15:45.570]  this company.
[15:45.570 --> 15:47.090]  I grew the plants and they look like shit.
[15:47.090 --> 15:50.490]  I'll say, well, that's funny because I've never sold any seeds to that company.
[15:51.130 --> 15:54.330]  They must not have sold you real IRI Genetics and I do apologize.
[15:54.330 --> 15:56.810]  Pay attention to where you're getting the seeds.
[15:56.810 --> 15:58.370]  Write down where your seeds came from.
[15:58.370 --> 15:59.690]  Write down the date in which you got them.
[15:59.690 --> 16:03.810]  That way if you run into problems, you do have some sort of history, some sort of timeline
[16:03.810 --> 16:05.010]  to go back on.
[16:05.010 --> 16:07.010]  A lot of us are consuming a lot of cannabis.
[16:07.010 --> 16:09.450]  A lot of us are just late night internet shoppers.
[16:09.450 --> 16:10.930]  We buy our seeds at random times.
[16:10.930 --> 16:13.810]  We don't remember exactly when and where we bought some shit.
[16:13.810 --> 16:14.810]  Write that on the package.
[16:14.810 --> 16:18.370]  A lot of the packages are fairly large or if you've got your spreadsheet going, put
[16:18.370 --> 16:20.090]  those details in the spreadsheet.
[16:20.090 --> 16:21.090]  When did I buy these seeds?
[16:21.090 --> 16:22.610]  Who did I buy them from?
[16:22.610 --> 16:26.810]  If you're really OCD, write down what you paid for them just for fun because you can
[16:26.810 --> 16:30.410]  watch, I'm watching the seed market move up and down right now.
[16:30.410 --> 16:34.290]  Some seeds that were worth a thousand dollars last year are not worth much this year and
[16:34.290 --> 16:37.530]  then seeds that weren't worth shit last year are worth a lot this year.
[16:37.530 --> 16:41.250]  It's great watching the market, the breeders, the trends.
[16:41.250 --> 16:42.250]  What is it?
[16:42.250 --> 16:44.890]  Weed X, stock weed, the stock market of cannabis.
[16:44.890 --> 16:46.650]  It's fun watching that move up and down.
[16:46.650 --> 16:47.650]  All right.
[16:47.650 --> 16:49.190]  I really feel like I've rambled out this episode.
[16:49.190 --> 16:51.550]  This could have been a longer episode, but there's no need to stretch it out.
[16:51.550 --> 16:52.990]  I've covered the topic.
[16:52.990 --> 16:54.990]  Keep your seeds in a cool, dry, dark place.
[16:54.990 --> 16:56.670]  I put them in a jar or a baggie.
[16:56.670 --> 17:00.310]  I throw that jar or baggie into a Grateful Dead lunchbox.
[17:00.310 --> 17:03.510]  If you're into Pokemon, if you're into Powerpuff Girls, if you're into the X-Men, if you're
[17:03.510 --> 17:08.310]  into Wolverine, whatever kind of lunchbox you've got, that will work for you.
[17:08.310 --> 17:11.290]  I've seen a lot of people use a tackle box or something similar.
[17:11.290 --> 17:13.770]  Put it in a box that is going to keep the light off of the seeds.
[17:13.770 --> 17:17.730]  Put those in the crisper drawer of the fridge or if you live in a cool place where it doesn't
[17:17.730 --> 17:20.170]  get too hot, too cold, you can keep them in a drawer.
[17:20.170 --> 17:22.650]  I prefer a safe to where it's nice and locked.
[17:22.650 --> 17:24.530]  In Colorado, the basement stays great here.
[17:24.530 --> 17:29.010]  If you've got a safe in the basement in Colorado, I'd recommend putting your seeds in a safe
[17:29.010 --> 17:30.010]  in the basement.
[17:30.010 --> 17:31.170]  They'll be great year round.
[17:31.170 --> 17:33.370]  The temperatures should stay pretty nice.
[17:33.370 --> 17:34.450]  All right, you guys.
[17:34.450 --> 17:36.850]  I feel like I'm just rambling at this point to make the show longer.
[17:36.850 --> 17:38.610]  There's no need to drag this out.
[17:38.610 --> 17:39.770]  Let's wrap up this podcast.
[17:39.770 --> 17:42.690]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, you know I would love to hear
[17:42.690 --> 17:43.690]  from you.
[17:43.690 --> 17:46.890]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[17:46.890 --> 17:47.890]  Don't be shy.
[17:47.890 --> 17:49.250]  Let me know what you think of the show.
[17:49.250 --> 17:53.690]  If you have any topics you'd like me to cover, any grow questions you'd like to ask, I would
[17:53.690 --> 17:54.690]  love to hear from you.
[17:54.690 --> 17:57.690]  Also, check out the website, ieregenetics.com.
[17:57.690 --> 18:00.450]  There's a link to the Discord, a link to Seed Vendors.
[18:00.450 --> 18:02.290]  There's a Grow Help tab there.
[18:02.290 --> 18:05.970]  On that Grow Help tab, I do ask you a few preliminary questions.
[18:05.970 --> 18:09.810]  We ask what's up with your temperature, your humidity, what you're growing.
[18:09.810 --> 18:10.810]  Is it indoors?
[18:10.810 --> 18:11.810]  Is it outdoors?
[18:11.810 --> 18:14.410]  A few basic questions so I know what's going on with your grow.
[18:14.410 --> 18:15.410]  Scroll down to the bottom.
[18:15.410 --> 18:19.170]  I will give you the opportunity to explain what is going on in your grow and ask for
[18:19.170 --> 18:20.170]  help.
[18:20.170 --> 18:21.170]  Let me know if you have problems.
[18:21.170 --> 18:24.610]  If you don't have grow problems or grow help, if you've got a basic cannabis culture question,
[18:24.610 --> 18:27.250]  a cultivation question, skip all the part above.
[18:27.250 --> 18:28.290]  Put your question right in there.
[18:28.290 --> 18:30.510]  I will answer that for you on the show.
[18:30.510 --> 18:33.250]  If I haven't answered your message already, please be patient.
[18:33.250 --> 18:37.490]  I've been doing a lot of focused episodes on the silver thiosulfate and other things.
[18:37.490 --> 18:40.290]  I will be getting to more listener emails very soon.
[18:40.290 --> 18:42.770]  I save them up and make big episodes out of those.
[18:42.770 --> 18:43.810]  Keep the messages coming.
[18:43.810 --> 18:44.810]  Don't forget about Patreon.
[18:45.210 --> 18:48.530]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[18:48.530 --> 18:49.530]  My throat is done.
