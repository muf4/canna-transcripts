[00:00.000 --> 00:01.840]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[00:01.840 --> 00:06.000]  It's time for episode 357 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.000 --> 00:09.160]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:09.160 --> 00:14.080]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and you can find
[00:14.080 --> 00:17.680]  them at dankseed.store.
[00:17.680 --> 00:20.600]  I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[00:20.600 --> 00:24.820]  Today, I'm taking dabs of Fatso II Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[00:24.820 --> 00:28.220]  This is a combination of GMO and Legend OG.
[00:28.220 --> 00:33.400]  On the package, it is described as dark roast coffee, garlic, and fuel.
[00:33.400 --> 00:37.680]  I would absolutely agree with that description, but I may add a little bit of underarm and
[00:37.680 --> 00:39.640]  onions to that description.
[00:39.640 --> 00:44.080]  There's kind of a rank after smell to this that I know it sounds disgusting, but it is
[00:44.080 --> 00:45.480]  really inviting.
[00:45.480 --> 00:48.920]  If I opened up this concentrate and let you smell it, you'd go, ooh, that is gross.
[00:48.920 --> 00:50.640]  Can I have a dab?
[00:50.640 --> 00:56.000]  And then when you dab it, it leaves this really savory aftertaste that I really enjoy, and
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.220]  it also gives me crazy cotton mouth.
[00:58.220 --> 01:02.780]  I haven't had a concentrate give me cotton mouth like that in a long time.
[01:02.780 --> 01:05.320]  It's also got a really nice heavy high.
[01:05.320 --> 01:06.820]  It sat me back in the chair.
[01:06.820 --> 01:09.840]  It made me just kind of sit here and stare into the computer screen for a couple of seconds
[01:09.840 --> 01:11.520]  before I started recording.
[01:11.520 --> 01:15.980]  It's got a really nice buzz, and I really enjoy the Fatso II Live Batter from Green
[01:15.980 --> 01:16.980]  Dot Labs.
[01:16.980 --> 01:21.680]  I've got a lot of information for you in this podcast, so let's get right to it.
[01:21.680 --> 01:26.580]  This is going to be the sixth grow lesson in a long series of lessons.
[01:26.580 --> 01:30.120]  In this lesson, we're going to talk about selecting your nutrients.
[01:30.120 --> 01:34.040]  If you're a new listener, if you're a new grower, I suggest you head back to episode
[01:34.040 --> 01:36.540]  351 and start listening there.
[01:36.540 --> 01:41.300]  That will give you a solid foundation on setting goals for your grow, selecting your space,
[01:41.300 --> 01:43.460]  and selecting your equipment for the grow.
[01:43.460 --> 01:47.760]  If you're an experienced grower, or if you've been listening, let's get right into selecting
[01:47.760 --> 01:51.420]  nutrients for your new grow.
[01:51.420 --> 01:55.820]  Selecting nutrients or fertilizers for your new garden can be very challenging.
[01:55.820 --> 01:58.900]  It can also be very intimidating.
[01:58.900 --> 02:04.360]  Nutrients and fertilizers are the most heavily advertised product in the grow store.
[02:04.360 --> 02:09.020]  After you have the grow set up, your nutrients will probably be the most expensive recurring
[02:09.020 --> 02:11.380]  cost you have in your grow.
[02:11.380 --> 02:17.300]  I'm going to do my best to guide you on selecting nutrients without recommending specific brands,
[02:17.300 --> 02:19.500]  without recommending specific products.
[02:19.500 --> 02:21.420]  I'm trying not to pitch anything here.
[02:21.420 --> 02:26.380]  I'm not trying to steer you any specific direction, but I want to give you a good idea and a good
[02:26.380 --> 02:31.140]  understanding of what to think about when you are trying to customize your garden for
[02:31.140 --> 02:32.440]  yourself.
[02:32.440 --> 02:37.100]  There are thousands of nutrient companies out there and countless ways to amend and
[02:37.100 --> 02:38.700]  fertilize soil.
[02:38.700 --> 02:44.080]  It may take a little bit of trial and error to dial in what works best for you.
[02:44.080 --> 02:48.460]  Don't be afraid to run one nutrient brand for your first grow and a completely different
[02:48.460 --> 02:50.580]  line for your second grow.
[02:50.580 --> 02:54.700]  Take notes when you do things like that and then you can compare what you liked better.
[02:54.700 --> 02:58.380]  Maybe one nutrient company will give you better flavors, one nutrient company is going to
[02:58.380 --> 03:01.900]  give you better yields, and one will probably give you better potency.
[03:01.900 --> 03:06.140]  If you can find the company that does all three of those and works with your grow style,
[03:06.140 --> 03:07.620]  that's what you want to do.
[03:07.620 --> 03:11.380]  Also, the cannabis industry is filled with egos.
[03:11.380 --> 03:15.260]  Don't let anybody tell you you are choosing the wrong line because it's not what they
[03:15.260 --> 03:16.260]  choose.
[03:16.260 --> 03:20.700]  As long as you are satisfied with the outcome and you are okay with the ethics of the company
[03:20.700 --> 03:24.900]  you are giving your money to, you can use whatever nutrients you want.
[03:24.900 --> 03:28.220]  That is the beauty of building your own grow.
[03:28.220 --> 03:33.620]  Now let's talk about some of the options when it comes to selecting nutrients for our grow.
[03:33.620 --> 03:37.040]  When you go to the grow store, the number one thing they're going to pitch to you is
[03:37.040 --> 03:39.220]  bottled nutrients.
[03:39.220 --> 03:42.160]  Grow stores love to sell bottled nutrients.
[03:42.160 --> 03:44.580]  There are different types of bottled nutrients available.
[03:44.580 --> 03:47.300]  You've got salt-based bottled nutrients.
[03:47.300 --> 03:50.820]  Most of your big brand names are salt-based.
[03:50.820 --> 03:53.580]  There are also organic bottled nutrients available.
[03:53.580 --> 03:56.940]  A lot of companies boast about having fully organic lines.
[03:56.940 --> 03:58.580]  That's always an option.
[03:58.580 --> 04:03.860]  Also there are veganic options available, which means there are no animal products in
[04:03.860 --> 04:05.900]  an organic lineup.
[04:05.900 --> 04:10.020]  And of course, we can always do a combination of organics and synthetics.
[04:10.020 --> 04:14.060]  There's always a nice balance to find there and make sure that none of our synthetic salt-based
[04:14.540 --> 04:18.420]  nutrients are going to destroy anything in our organic nutrients.
[04:18.420 --> 04:22.980]  But there is no problem using them together once you understand that balance.
[04:22.980 --> 04:27.260]  Now let's talk about some of the pros and cons of bottled nutrients.
[04:27.260 --> 04:31.860]  A moment ago, I said you can choose whatever brand you like as long as you are comfortable
[04:31.860 --> 04:33.380]  with their ethics.
[04:33.380 --> 04:35.260]  Now what do I mean by that?
[04:35.260 --> 04:40.180]  As a consumer, it is our responsibility to understand what the companies we support do
[04:40.180 --> 04:42.180]  with the money we give them.
[04:42.180 --> 04:45.860]  If you don't agree with the way a company operates, if you don't agree with things a
[04:45.860 --> 04:49.300]  company supports, you do not have to shop with that company.
[04:49.300 --> 04:51.420]  You vote with your dollars.
[04:51.420 --> 04:54.940]  Try to spend your money with a company who supports cannabis.
[04:54.940 --> 04:57.340]  Try to keep your money on our team.
[04:57.340 --> 05:01.560]  Try not to spend your money with a company who is unethical, with a company who is slowly
[05:01.560 --> 05:05.700]  destroying the world, with a company who is slowly poisoning mankind.
[05:05.700 --> 05:09.700]  So when it comes to selecting nutrients, do a little bit of research about the company.
[05:09.700 --> 05:11.820]  Do research about their parent company.
[05:11.820 --> 05:16.420]  See who owns that company and find out who's at the top of the food chain and see who you're
[05:16.420 --> 05:17.900]  giving your money to.
[05:17.900 --> 05:22.500]  I know I just added a whole new step to your selection process, but that is my responsibility
[05:22.500 --> 05:24.800]  is to make you guys think about stuff like that.
[05:24.800 --> 05:28.380]  So think about the ethics of the company you are spending your money with when you are
[05:28.380 --> 05:30.300]  selecting your nutrients.
[05:30.300 --> 05:34.460]  Now let's talk more about the pros and cons of bottled nutrients specifically.
[05:34.460 --> 05:39.460]  Before we even get started, I know that bottled nutrients are not for everybody, but I also
[05:39.460 --> 05:43.700]  know that amended soils and living soils are not for everybody.
[05:43.700 --> 05:47.600]  So if you are a living soil guy, if you're an organic guy, I get it.
[05:47.600 --> 05:51.040]  You're probably already pulling your hair out saying, Jeff, don't recommend bottles
[05:51.040 --> 05:56.340]  to new growers, but you've got to keep in mind, not everybody is able to run a no-till
[05:56.340 --> 05:57.340]  grow.
[05:57.340 --> 06:00.500]  Not everybody is able to set up a living soil system.
[06:00.500 --> 06:04.060]  And also some people may just want to do bottled nutrients.
[06:04.060 --> 06:07.780]  If you're a chemistry student or your mind thinks that way, maybe you want a measuring
[06:07.780 --> 06:12.060]  device and a bottle of liquid to measure and then mix and then balance the pH.
[06:12.060 --> 06:13.580]  Maybe that's fun for you.
[06:13.580 --> 06:17.580]  If you're more of a biology student, you're more into horticulture and more into the dirt.
[06:17.580 --> 06:19.840]  Maybe you want to make the pre-amended soil.
[06:19.840 --> 06:23.120]  It's all about doing it your way and what makes you happy.
[06:23.120 --> 06:25.520]  So I'm going to start with bottled nutrients.
[06:25.520 --> 06:29.140]  The pros to bottled nutrients are they are available.
[06:29.140 --> 06:31.860]  You can go to a grocery store and they are on the shelf.
[06:31.860 --> 06:34.540]  You can go to Amazon and they are right there.
[06:34.540 --> 06:39.900]  One of the major advantages to bottled nutrients is that they are available.
[06:39.900 --> 06:45.900]  Another advantage to bottled nutrients is an available nutrient feeding schedule.
[06:45.900 --> 06:50.640]  Most of the reputable nutrient companies have a website that includes a nutrient calculator
[06:50.640 --> 06:53.140]  or a nutrient feed schedule.
[06:53.140 --> 06:54.900]  These are really easy to work with.
[06:54.900 --> 06:58.860]  You type in how many weeks you're going to veg, you type in how many weeks you're going
[06:58.860 --> 07:04.060]  to flour, and that website makes a custom nutrient regimen to fit your schedule.
[07:04.580 --> 07:08.660]  So week one of veg, it will tell you week one, feed this nutrient at this rate.
[07:08.660 --> 07:14.840]  So it'll say week one, use your base nutrients at 25 mils, use cow mag at five mils, use
[07:14.840 --> 07:17.300]  whatever else at this many mils per gallon of water.
[07:17.300 --> 07:20.540]  So you know week one, it's all right here listed out for me.
[07:20.540 --> 07:22.140]  Week two, what do I need to feed on week two?
[07:22.140 --> 07:26.660]  Oh, it says 25 mils of this, 10 mils of this, and 10 mils of this, and it'll run you all
[07:26.660 --> 07:30.300]  the way through the growth cycle, all the way up to the time you flush.
[07:30.300 --> 07:33.780]  So if you select a brand, you buy their lineup, you go to their website, you've got basic
[07:34.500 --> 07:37.620]  instructions on how to mix that brand for optimal results for your plants.
[07:37.620 --> 07:38.980]  Now you will need to dial that in.
[07:38.980 --> 07:43.340]  Not all plants are the same, but they give you a pretty good guideline on how to get
[07:43.340 --> 07:44.340]  started.
[07:44.340 --> 07:48.060]  Of course, those companies want you to buy more bottles more frequently, so you can always
[07:48.060 --> 07:54.120]  reduce the recommended dosage, maybe 50%, maybe use 75%, but there's no need to start
[07:54.120 --> 07:56.520]  off at the whole recommended dosage.
[07:56.520 --> 08:00.960]  If you need more, you can add more, but you can never take out once you've burnt the plants.
[08:00.960 --> 08:02.900]  Once they're burnt, they are burned.
[08:03.020 --> 08:04.020]  So that's my recommendation.
[08:04.020 --> 08:09.020]  Start, it may be 50% to 75% of the recommended dosage on those schedules, and then increase
[08:09.020 --> 08:10.020]  as needed.
[08:10.020 --> 08:13.540]  And as you get more experienced with the plants, you will start to see if they need less or
[08:13.540 --> 08:14.900]  more nutrients.
[08:14.900 --> 08:16.240]  So that's a really handy thing.
[08:16.240 --> 08:19.940]  They have a nutrient calculator on the website.
[08:19.940 --> 08:24.780]  So learning to grow with bottles can be very easy because of the accessibility and these
[08:24.780 --> 08:25.780]  websites.
[08:25.780 --> 08:30.780]  Another great thing about bottle nutrients is easily repeatable results.
[08:30.780 --> 08:32.960]  We know exactly what is in each bottle.
[08:32.960 --> 08:35.460]  We know the ratios of each element in there.
[08:35.460 --> 08:41.580]  So if we wrote down how much we fed each nutrient, each feeding time, and we also documented
[08:41.580 --> 08:46.780]  the pH of those feedings, we should be able to have repeatable results using the same
[08:46.780 --> 08:48.260]  product every time.
[08:48.260 --> 08:51.260]  Now, you will need similar environmental factors in the room.
[08:51.260 --> 08:54.820]  You'll need the same temperature and the same humidity and the same VPD.
[08:54.820 --> 08:59.340]  But as long as nothing changed too drastically in your grow room, you'll be able to repeat
[08:59.420 --> 09:04.140]  your last feeding schedule and your crop should come out with similar quality to the last
[09:04.140 --> 09:05.140]  harvest.
[09:05.140 --> 09:09.300]  All right, those are some of the pros of working with bottled nutrients.
[09:09.300 --> 09:10.820]  They are readily available.
[09:10.820 --> 09:12.820]  There are nutrient schedules available.
[09:12.820 --> 09:15.820]  They're fairly easy to work with, and they are reliable.
[09:15.820 --> 09:19.180]  We know exactly what is in each bottle.
[09:19.180 --> 09:24.060]  Now let's talk about some of the cons to bottled nutrients.
[09:24.060 --> 09:29.300]  Most of the cons to working with bottle nutrients are all related, and they are mostly environmental.
[09:30.260 --> 09:33.460]  First, we have a bunch of plastic bottles.
[09:33.460 --> 09:36.060]  That is environmentally unsustainable.
[09:36.060 --> 09:41.220]  Then we are shipping plastic bottles filled with water across the country.
[09:41.220 --> 09:45.340]  Most of the nutrients we are buying are 80 to 90% water.
[09:45.340 --> 09:50.300]  So we are basically paying a truck driver to drive his truck across the country to haul
[09:50.300 --> 09:52.860]  plastic bottles of water.
[09:52.860 --> 09:54.660]  That is completely unsustainable.
[09:54.660 --> 09:57.740]  Then once that bottle gets to us, we have it for a couple of weeks.
[09:57.740 --> 09:58.740]  Then what do we do?
[09:59.180 --> 10:01.700]  We either throw away or recycle that plastic bottle.
[10:01.700 --> 10:06.780]  The recycling center in my area will not take plastic bottles that had nutrients or pesticides
[10:06.780 --> 10:07.780]  in them.
[10:07.780 --> 10:10.180]  They cannot do it, so they have to be thrown away.
[10:10.180 --> 10:15.020]  So the downside is that we are shipping plastic bottles filled with water, and then we are
[10:15.020 --> 10:17.220]  throwing plastic bottles in a landfill.
[10:17.220 --> 10:19.020]  It's very unsustainable.
[10:19.020 --> 10:24.420]  So most of the reasons to not use bottled nutrients are environmentally based and sustainability
[10:24.420 --> 10:25.740]  based.
[10:25.740 --> 10:30.900]  So most of the cons to working with bottled nutrients are environmental factors.
[10:30.900 --> 10:34.340]  Another thing to think about is, are you going to know how to grow when those bottles go
[10:34.340 --> 10:35.340]  away?
[10:35.340 --> 10:39.300]  If the grow store is to close and society falls apart and we have to go back to actually
[10:39.300 --> 10:43.500]  farming, are you going to understand how to farm your cannabis plants?
[10:43.500 --> 10:46.580]  Or are you going to be stuck reaching for bottles?
[10:46.580 --> 10:51.060]  That's where the organic and the no-till guys really laugh at the bottle growers.
[10:51.060 --> 10:55.820]  So those are the pros and cons of working with bottled nutrients.
[10:55.820 --> 11:00.500]  When you're shopping for bottled nutrients, don't be sold by cool packaging and fancy
[11:00.500 --> 11:01.500]  logos.
[11:01.500 --> 11:06.500]  Also, when it comes to selecting nutrients, if you're a new grower, I recommend you stick
[11:06.500 --> 11:08.360]  with one brand.
[11:08.360 --> 11:12.900]  Don't try to buy base nutrients from one company, CalMag from another company, a bloom booster
[11:12.900 --> 11:14.420]  from another company.
[11:14.420 --> 11:17.220]  This will lead to problems.
[11:17.220 --> 11:21.020]  Let me try to quickly explain why this could become problematic.
[11:21.020 --> 11:26.260]  Each company breaks down the required elements for your plants in different bottles, different
[11:26.260 --> 11:27.260]  packages.
[11:27.260 --> 11:31.940]  Now, some of these elements can be mixed together in a bottle and some cannot be mixed together
[11:31.940 --> 11:32.940]  in bottles.
[11:32.940 --> 11:35.240]  So they've got to make two different products.
[11:35.240 --> 11:39.740]  Some companies want you to buy 30 different bottles so that you can dial in that mix to
[11:39.740 --> 11:45.220]  have exactly as much nitrogen as you want, exactly as much phosphorus, exactly as much
[11:45.220 --> 11:49.980]  potassium, while other companies will mix the nitrogen in one bottle and the phosphorus
[11:49.980 --> 11:52.180]  and potassium in another bottle.
[11:52.180 --> 11:56.740]  They do that because it's easier than having 30 bottles for your nutrient line.
[11:56.740 --> 12:00.260]  So each company knows what is in each product they are putting out.
[12:00.260 --> 12:04.780]  They know that if they put out a base and a bloom booster and you use them together,
[12:04.780 --> 12:09.180]  they know they did not double up on any specific element in those two bottles.
[12:09.180 --> 12:14.180]  Now if you grab a base nutrient from one brand and a bloom booster from another brand, they
[12:14.180 --> 12:18.420]  never spoke to each other, you may be doubling up and adding too much of one element to your
[12:18.420 --> 12:20.780]  plant and not even realize it.
[12:20.780 --> 12:23.820]  So that's why I recommend picking one brand and sticking with it.
[12:23.820 --> 12:25.180]  It has nothing to do with loyalty.
[12:25.180 --> 12:26.780]  It has nothing to do with marketing.
[12:26.780 --> 12:32.140]  It just has to do with making sure you do not double up and burn your plants.
[12:32.140 --> 12:37.060]  Now I've got one more note about bottled nutrients I want to discuss before we move on.
[12:37.060 --> 12:38.060]  Keep this in mind.
[12:38.060 --> 12:41.420]  Our plants require 16 elements for healthy growth.
[12:41.420 --> 12:45.980]  Our plants require carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.
[12:45.980 --> 12:48.180]  Now those come from the air and the water.
[12:48.180 --> 12:51.380]  The nitrogen comes from the air and the soil.
[12:51.380 --> 13:00.620]  Also our plants want phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, chlorine,
[13:00.620 --> 13:06.100]  copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc.
[13:06.100 --> 13:08.540]  Those are the necessary elements.
[13:08.540 --> 13:13.500]  As long as the nutrients you are buying have all of those required elements, you are covering
[13:13.500 --> 13:15.500]  most of your bases.
[13:15.500 --> 13:18.260]  Of course I would recommend adding an enzymatic product.
[13:18.260 --> 13:20.020]  Some sort of enzymes are going to help.
[13:20.020 --> 13:21.540]  Some sort of carbs are going to help.
[13:21.540 --> 13:28.380]  And I always recommend some sort of root love, some sort of beneficial microbes, some mycos,
[13:28.380 --> 13:32.860]  beneficial fungus, beneficial bacteria for your rhizosphere.
[13:32.860 --> 13:38.060]  Now you may also need a PK booster, a bloom booster later in flower, but you don't need
[13:38.060 --> 13:41.540]  a whole bunch of unnecessary ingredients for your plant.
[13:41.540 --> 13:46.300]  As long as you're getting these 16 elements, maybe some enzymes, maybe some carbs, and
[13:46.300 --> 13:51.220]  I would always recommend some sort of a root inoculant, your plants will be happy.
[13:51.220 --> 13:55.140]  Don't let the guy at the grow store sell you stuff because he works on commission.
[13:55.140 --> 13:59.540]  Don't let the bottles at the grow store sell you stuff because they have really cool logos
[13:59.540 --> 14:01.300]  and they're well advertised.
[14:01.300 --> 14:05.940]  When you go to a farm supply store, everything comes in a white bag with black writing and
[14:05.940 --> 14:07.620]  it all works.
[14:07.620 --> 14:11.860]  All of that fancy labeling and packaging is just something to charge you extra for, so
[14:11.860 --> 14:13.700]  don't fall for it.
[14:13.700 --> 14:16.860]  Now the next part of my note says to discuss my experience.
[14:16.860 --> 14:20.660]  I try not to talk too much about specific brands in here, so I'm not going to go too
[14:20.660 --> 14:25.780]  far in detail and I may not even say specific brand names, but you may catch on.
[14:25.780 --> 14:29.580]  When I first started growing, I used a very popular brand of nutrients.
[14:29.580 --> 14:32.860]  They are that company that has about 40 bottles available.
[14:32.860 --> 14:34.780]  I bought all 40 bottles.
[14:34.780 --> 14:37.980]  I had a lot of fun mixing and dialing in that mix.
[14:37.980 --> 14:42.180]  I did that stuff for two or three years and I got really good at it.
[14:42.180 --> 14:46.740]  I was able to pull over two pounds from a normal thousand watt light in an indoor basement
[14:46.740 --> 14:50.580]  grow reliably using this company's nutrients.
[14:50.580 --> 14:56.580]  Unfortunately, everything I grew with that product tasted and smelled and looked exactly
[14:56.580 --> 14:57.740]  the same.
[14:57.740 --> 15:02.660]  If I grew OG Kush and Super Lemon Haze in the same room with this nutrient line, they
[15:02.660 --> 15:05.780]  would both smell and look fairly similar.
[15:05.780 --> 15:09.460]  There would be a lot of weed and it would be really potent, but you could barely tell
[15:09.460 --> 15:11.460]  that I grew two different strains.
[15:11.460 --> 15:12.900]  I didn't like that.
[15:12.900 --> 15:16.540]  So I switched to another company that was known to be their competitor.
[15:16.540 --> 15:20.820]  This company still had quite a few bottles, but not as many, but this company was not
[15:20.820 --> 15:25.500]  nearly as expensive as the brand I had tried before, so I started using their product.
[15:25.500 --> 15:29.340]  I could tell a few weeks in that I was not satisfied with that product either.
[15:29.340 --> 15:30.860]  My plants were looking colorful.
[15:30.860 --> 15:36.140]  I could tell a huge difference in each varietal, but there was not going to be the weight or
[15:36.140 --> 15:38.860]  potency that I'd gotten from the previous brand.
[15:38.860 --> 15:42.500]  So that's when I had to get rid of that product and move on to something else.
[15:42.500 --> 15:46.580]  I'd been doing a lot of research and I had fallen in love with Botanicare.
[15:46.580 --> 15:50.620]  Now I know I told you I wasn't going to talk about a lot of brands, but Botanicare did
[15:50.620 --> 15:53.860]  a really good job for me for a really long time.
[15:53.860 --> 15:58.960]  I dialed in a beautiful Botanicare recipe with a couple of additives and I grew some
[15:58.960 --> 16:05.100]  of the best cannabis I have ever smoked with Botanicare nutrients and a few other additives.
[16:05.100 --> 16:08.120]  I was ecstatic with my results from Botanicare.
[16:08.120 --> 16:10.640]  Then I noticed something started changing.
[16:10.640 --> 16:12.600]  They were changing their recipes.
[16:12.600 --> 16:16.480]  Then one day they announced that they had sold their company.
[16:16.480 --> 16:19.960]  Noticing that the recipe was changing and that my plants weren't as happy as they had
[16:19.960 --> 16:24.400]  been with that product before already had me looking into another product line.
[16:24.480 --> 16:28.880]  I was also working in commercial grows and experimenting with other product lines in
[16:28.880 --> 16:30.360]  those grows.
[16:30.360 --> 16:34.600]  Being exposed to commercial grows and the options to run so many different products
[16:34.600 --> 16:39.440]  on so many different levels let me see what worked and what did not work for me and the
[16:39.440 --> 16:40.760]  way that I grow.
[16:40.760 --> 16:44.720]  So knowing that Botanicare was changing their recipes and then discovering that Botanicare
[16:44.720 --> 16:49.040]  had sold their brand to Hawthorne, who is one of those companies I spoke of earlier
[16:49.040 --> 16:52.640]  that we would rather not support, I had to make a change.
[16:52.680 --> 16:56.680]  I had been using a powdered nutrient system in a commercial grow for quite a while and
[16:56.680 --> 16:58.760]  I was ecstatic with the results.
[16:58.760 --> 17:04.480]  I had also been learning to use another bottled nutrient system in that grow and I was completely
[17:04.480 --> 17:07.920]  satisfied with their results as well.
[17:07.920 --> 17:12.140]  Over time I realized that the powdered nutrient company was lacking just a couple of things
[17:12.140 --> 17:16.000]  that I could probably boost up my production if I added a few things.
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.880]  So I took a couple of products from that bottled nutrient line and added those to my powdered
[17:21.320 --> 17:26.800]  nutrient line and by using two different nutrient companies I have created a stellar nutrient
[17:26.800 --> 17:29.480]  program for my grow.
[17:29.480 --> 17:33.560]  Now earlier I did say that I would recommend you stick to one brand but once you learn
[17:33.560 --> 17:37.320]  the plants and you learn about the nutrients you'll be able to customize your mix to as
[17:37.320 --> 17:41.760]  many brands as you like as long as you understand what's in each bottle.
[17:41.760 --> 17:45.680]  Now I've been trying to avoid giving you brand names and specific product names but I already
[17:45.680 --> 17:48.960]  know I'm going to get a bunch of emails if I don't tell you what I use so I'm just going
[17:48.960 --> 17:53.680]  to spill the beans and tell you that I use Veg Bloom powdered nutrients as my base.
[17:53.680 --> 17:55.400]  I use Veg Bloom HD.
[17:55.400 --> 18:01.000]  I also use Plus Life and when we get into flower I start adding two grams of Shine and
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.920]  then as we get later into flower I will increase the Shine.
[18:03.920 --> 18:05.160]  That's very strain specific.
[18:05.160 --> 18:09.960]  I've gotten up to four grams of Shine per gallon on some strains and they love it.
[18:09.960 --> 18:14.360]  To the Veg Bloom mix I also add a little bit of New Millennium products.
[18:14.360 --> 18:19.320]  I use the Ruby, the fulvic acid from New Millennium and I also use the Carbonaria,
[18:19.320 --> 18:21.360]  the carbs from New Millennium.
[18:21.360 --> 18:24.160]  So I'm adding a little fulvic acid to increase uptake.
[18:24.160 --> 18:27.200]  I'm adding a little bit of carbs to give more energy.
[18:27.200 --> 18:32.640]  Then I also add SLF 100 enzymes and if the plants show me that they need more CalMag
[18:32.640 --> 18:36.560]  we use Cali Magic from GH in a commercial facility.
[18:36.560 --> 18:41.320]  And that is basically my nutrient schedule for a large commercial grow.
[18:41.320 --> 18:44.320]  Alright that's my rant on bottled nutrients.
[18:44.320 --> 18:47.320]  Now let's talk more about amended soils.
[18:47.320 --> 18:51.720]  Let's talk about super soil, let's talk about living soil and we'll kind of touch on no-till
[18:51.720 --> 18:53.920]  environments as well.
[18:53.920 --> 18:58.880]  I don't have as much experience in this realm so I will not have as many details for you.
[18:58.880 --> 19:02.600]  But I'm sure that I'll be able to give you a good enough breakdown to help you make your
[19:02.600 --> 19:07.880]  decision in selecting your nutrient or your fertilizing style for your new garden.
[19:07.880 --> 19:13.160]  Now let's talk a little bit about what I mean by living soils and super soils.
[19:13.160 --> 19:16.360]  This is a more natural, more sustainable approach.
[19:16.360 --> 19:21.080]  Your super soil can be as simple or as elaborate as you want to make it.
[19:21.080 --> 19:25.820]  There are a lot of recipes for usable super soils online.
[19:25.820 --> 19:28.280]  Making your own living soil can be very easy.
[19:28.280 --> 19:33.600]  You are basically combining dried amendments with soil or soilless mix and giving it the
[19:33.600 --> 19:38.280]  proper conditions and time to cook and become alive.
[19:38.280 --> 19:41.680]  The way I would do it is throw a large tarp on the garage floor.
[19:41.680 --> 19:43.920]  I would put out the amount of soil that I need.
[19:43.920 --> 19:46.480]  I would add all the dried amendments on top of that.
[19:46.480 --> 19:50.080]  I would use a shovel and or a pitchfork to stir that up real nice.
[19:50.080 --> 19:53.400]  Then once it's all mixed up, you add it to a trash can.
[19:53.400 --> 19:57.440]  You may need to add a little bit of moisture to your new concoction just to get the party
[19:57.440 --> 19:58.440]  started.
[19:58.440 --> 20:03.000]  Then you put the lid on the trash can and store it in a warm area and wait about 30
[20:03.000 --> 20:04.000]  days.
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.320]  Over time, all of those amendments will start breaking down in that soil and they will create
[20:08.320 --> 20:11.520]  a living environment in that trash can.
[20:11.520 --> 20:16.040]  When you take the lid off of that trash can, if you see a white layer of moldy funk on
[20:16.040 --> 20:19.660]  top of the dirt, that is exactly what we are looking for.
[20:19.660 --> 20:20.840]  That is life.
[20:20.840 --> 20:23.080]  You have created living soil.
[20:23.080 --> 20:27.480]  We have basically mimicked what mother nature does inside of a small container and we are
[20:27.480 --> 20:31.960]  giving the plants exactly what they would want without force feeding them anything that
[20:31.960 --> 20:33.560]  they do not want.
[20:33.560 --> 20:38.520]  Now depending on the mineral content of your newly made soil, you may need to add a little
[20:38.520 --> 20:43.000]  bit of uncharged soil to your pots when you are putting new plants in there because that
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.280]  fresh soil may be a little too potent.
[20:45.280 --> 20:49.400]  It may be a little too rich and you may need to cut it down to reduce burning your new
[20:49.400 --> 20:50.680]  baby plants.
[20:50.680 --> 20:54.600]  So that's something to think about when working with the living soil.
[20:54.600 --> 20:59.480]  Now let's talk a little bit about the pros and cons of a living soil environment.
[20:59.480 --> 21:03.200]  The main, the best part is that it is organic.
[21:03.200 --> 21:08.080]  As long as everything you put in there is organic, you have got an organic grow.
[21:08.080 --> 21:11.080]  It is also very sustainable.
[21:11.080 --> 21:13.120]  Most of those dried amendments come in a box.
[21:13.120 --> 21:16.360]  That box is either compostable or recyclable.
[21:16.360 --> 21:19.280]  Also there is not a bunch of water in that box to ship around.
[21:19.280 --> 21:24.200]  So you are getting the product, the product goes into the soil, the box goes into recycling.
[21:24.200 --> 21:26.600]  There is very minimal waste.
[21:26.600 --> 21:30.840]  Some of those meals are actually waste products that we are reusing.
[21:30.840 --> 21:35.360]  So we are actually recycling and putting a waste product to use by putting it in our
[21:35.360 --> 21:36.440]  garden.
[21:36.440 --> 21:40.280]  So that's a huge advantage of living soil situations.
[21:40.280 --> 21:44.440]  Also when you start running a living soil or an organic garden, you will also probably
[21:44.440 --> 21:49.760]  end up creating a compost bin in your home, which will also create more environmental
[21:49.760 --> 21:52.760]  awareness, which will just cause a chain reaction.
[21:52.760 --> 21:56.560]  Once you start growing organically, you will start seeing things on a more organic level
[21:56.560 --> 21:57.560]  in your whole life.
[21:57.560 --> 22:00.960]  It will affect your eating, it will affect your shopping, you will start thinking about
[22:00.960 --> 22:03.480]  the earth differently as a whole.
[22:03.520 --> 22:07.320]  So that's one of the benefits and also some of the side effects of growing in a living
[22:07.320 --> 22:09.040]  soil environment.
[22:09.040 --> 22:14.200]  If you start working in a no-till environment, another huge advantage is very minimal waste.
[22:14.200 --> 22:17.440]  When it comes to no-till, there is essentially no waste.
[22:17.440 --> 22:21.720]  In a no-till environment, you harvest a plant, you hang the plant.
[22:21.720 --> 22:25.360]  That gets trimmed and dried and cured and consumed.
[22:25.360 --> 22:28.320]  The waste goes back into your compost pile.
[22:28.320 --> 22:31.680]  That pot where we just cut that plant out of, we are going to gently cut the root ball
[22:31.800 --> 22:32.800]  out of there.
[22:32.800 --> 22:35.120]  Just that big root ball, just take that out.
[22:35.120 --> 22:38.840]  Then we're going to put another clone in that spot and we're going to backfill that with
[22:38.840 --> 22:41.920]  composted dirt that we've got in our compost pile.
[22:41.920 --> 22:46.680]  Now we've got a fresh plant ready to go with zero waste.
[22:46.680 --> 22:50.120]  So that is a huge advantage to a no-till garden.
[22:50.120 --> 22:54.840]  People growing cocoa or growing soil, they've got to figure out how to either recycle or
[22:54.840 --> 22:57.680]  get rid of all of that cocoa or soil.
[22:57.680 --> 23:03.520]  If you've got more than four or five, three gallon pots worth of used cocoa or soil, it
[23:03.520 --> 23:05.280]  becomes a challenge to try to get rid of that.
[23:05.280 --> 23:07.280]  You can't just dump it in the backyard.
[23:07.280 --> 23:10.720]  Someone's going to notice that big fresh pile of dirt with a bunch of perlite in there and
[23:10.720 --> 23:12.640]  then they're going to say, perlite, what's he doing?
[23:12.640 --> 23:14.520]  And it's going to just start triggering things.
[23:14.520 --> 23:18.100]  So that's hugely advantageous to not have any waste.
[23:18.100 --> 23:24.080]  When it comes to no-till gardening, another huge advantage is there are minimal bug threats.
[23:24.080 --> 23:28.640]  It seems like when you establish a no-till garden, it comes right along with beneficial
[23:28.640 --> 23:29.640]  insects.
[23:29.640 --> 23:34.400]  And if you do introduce any spider mites or unwanted pests, those beneficial insects are
[23:34.400 --> 23:39.760]  already there and they'll creep in and destroy the population before it gets out of control.
[23:39.760 --> 23:42.820]  So that's always a good thing with a no-till garden.
[23:42.820 --> 23:46.960]  Our friend Frosty was on the show a while back and he was talking about going hiking
[23:46.960 --> 23:49.000]  and then walking right into his no-till grow.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  And I said, bro, don't you kind of worry about maybe gathering a spider mite on your shoe
[23:53.000 --> 23:54.680]  and taking spider mites into that grow?
[23:54.680 --> 23:58.720]  And he said, bro, that's just food for the predator mites that are already in there.
[23:58.720 --> 24:03.560]  So the no-till guys seem to be fairly confident in their pest management system.
[24:03.560 --> 24:09.040]  So some of the major advantages to a living soil or an organic system are it is clean
[24:09.040 --> 24:10.040]  and organic.
[24:10.040 --> 24:13.640]  As long as everything you put in there is organic, you know that everything comes out
[24:13.640 --> 24:15.600]  of there is organic.
[24:15.600 --> 24:18.200]  That means a lot to a lot of people.
[24:18.200 --> 24:19.800]  Also it is sustainable.
[24:19.800 --> 24:25.320]  If the grow shop burns down, if Amazon shuts down, if you learn how to grow like a farmer,
[24:25.320 --> 24:28.560]  when the shit hits the fan, you'll be one of the few people out there growing your own
[24:28.560 --> 24:31.480]  food and growing herb for us to smoke.
[24:31.480 --> 24:33.920]  And that goes right along with what I call a side effect.
[24:33.920 --> 24:37.740]  You start becoming more aware of what you're doing to the environment.
[24:37.740 --> 24:41.380]  When you go grocery shopping, you'll find yourself in the produce section trying to
[24:41.380 --> 24:46.240]  buy more things that have something you can add to your compost bin after you eat.
[24:46.240 --> 24:50.920]  So it will totally affect the way you shop, the way you eat, and the way you live.
[24:50.920 --> 24:55.880]  And when you head into the no-till range, another huge advantage is minimal waste and
[24:55.880 --> 24:58.640]  very minimal pests.
[24:58.640 --> 25:02.880]  Now once we've got our living soil established and we've got our garden going, if we do notice
[25:02.880 --> 25:08.360]  some sort of a deficiency, there are ways that we can add nutrients to our organic system
[25:08.360 --> 25:10.440]  without introducing bottled nutrients.
[25:10.440 --> 25:13.920]  It is very easy to brew up a compost tea.
[25:13.920 --> 25:17.680]  Sean and Jesse have talked about compost teas a lot on this show.
[25:17.680 --> 25:19.920]  I'm not going to go too deep into making a tea.
[25:19.920 --> 25:24.360]  You basically throw amendments in a bucket and add an aerator and you let it bubble for
[25:24.360 --> 25:26.160]  a certain amount of time.
[25:26.160 --> 25:29.920]  Then depending on the strength of the tea and the type of tea we made, we either dilute
[25:29.920 --> 25:33.400]  it or we water it directly into the plants.
[25:33.400 --> 25:39.040]  As long as everything you used to make your tea was organic, your grow is still fully
[25:39.040 --> 25:40.600]  organic.
[25:40.600 --> 25:45.760]  Another option for adding nutrients to a slowing organic garden is to top dress.
[25:45.760 --> 25:50.280]  You can place organic amendments on top of the soil and water them in just like you would
[25:50.280 --> 25:52.000]  a bottled nutrient.
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.120]  This may not work as rapidly as it would when using bottled nutrients because you will need
[25:56.120 --> 25:59.600]  time for the organic amendments to break down.
[25:59.600 --> 26:05.440]  But top dressing is certainly a way to add nutrients to an organic living soil without
[26:05.440 --> 26:07.680]  introducing bottled nutrients.
[26:07.680 --> 26:11.680]  So if you've set up a living soil or a super soil and you see those plants are slowing
[26:11.680 --> 26:16.140]  down or if you see those plants are showing you some type of deficiency, you should be
[26:16.140 --> 26:20.920]  able to brew up a compost tea or top dress with the appropriate amendment to add the
[26:20.920 --> 26:23.840]  missing element that those plants will need.
[26:23.840 --> 26:28.680]  Things I have heard Jesse and Sean talk about top dressing quite often are fish meal, kelp
[26:28.680 --> 26:31.940]  meal, alfalfa, and comfrey.
[26:31.940 --> 26:36.400]  So now before I get myself too far off track, let's talk about some of the cons of working
[26:36.560 --> 26:40.040]  a living soil or a super soil type environment.
[26:40.040 --> 26:42.280]  The downside is the mix work.
[26:42.280 --> 26:45.960]  If you don't have a space to mix this, if you don't have a space to cook the soil, it
[26:45.960 --> 26:47.200]  might not be an option.
[26:47.200 --> 26:50.160]  It does take a lot of space to create this soil.
[26:50.160 --> 26:54.320]  Then it does take a trash can worth of space to store this soil.
[26:54.320 --> 26:57.840]  Now that leads me right into the next part, which is the cook time.
[26:57.840 --> 27:01.960]  Maybe you decided you want to start a garden and you're going to start it next week.
[27:01.960 --> 27:05.700]  You need at least 30 days to brew up a batch of super soil.
[27:05.700 --> 27:07.500]  You were already running late.
[27:07.500 --> 27:09.780]  So the downside is the cook time.
[27:09.780 --> 27:10.980]  You've got to mix it.
[27:10.980 --> 27:14.020]  You've got to let it cook and come alive.
[27:14.020 --> 27:18.980]  Now another disadvantage to working with a super soil or a living soil is understanding
[27:18.980 --> 27:21.620]  the richness of the soil you just made.
[27:21.620 --> 27:23.620]  Is that soil too hot for little plants?
[27:23.620 --> 27:25.580]  Will it be okay for little plants?
[27:25.580 --> 27:29.660]  A new grower may not have the eye to see if those plants are having problems and they
[27:29.660 --> 27:33.980]  won't know how to identify it and they won't know how to prevent or correct an issue if
[27:33.980 --> 27:35.900]  they see it in a living soil.
[27:35.900 --> 27:38.700]  So that could be problematic.
[27:38.700 --> 27:43.660]  Another disadvantage to working with a living soil is if you do have a pest issue, you are
[27:43.660 --> 27:48.020]  very limited on approaches for eradicating your pests.
[27:48.020 --> 27:50.780]  You've got to stick to organic options.
[27:50.780 --> 27:55.320]  If you've got a soil pest problem, your options are very limited.
[27:55.320 --> 27:59.900]  Like we said earlier, you shouldn't encounter too many problems in an organic soil environment
[27:59.900 --> 28:03.740]  because we've got enough microorganisms there to keep that in check.
[28:04.100 --> 28:08.620]  If you do end up with a root problem, you are very limited on ways you can treat.
[28:08.620 --> 28:12.060]  You cannot treat your living soil with a root drench.
[28:12.060 --> 28:15.940]  If you were running a soil garden and you were feeding with bottled nutrients and you
[28:15.940 --> 28:21.600]  ran into a root problem like a root pest, you would be able to do a root drench with
[28:21.600 --> 28:25.700]  a pesticide, either Botanigard Max or Evergreen.
[28:25.700 --> 28:30.020]  You just mix up 15 to 30 mls per gallon and you water that right in with your feeding
[28:30.020 --> 28:34.380]  solution and that will eradicate any soil-borne pests.
[28:34.380 --> 28:40.860]  If we go feeding Botanigard Max or Evergreen to a living soil situation, we basically destroy
[28:40.860 --> 28:44.020]  the entire environment we worked to create in there.
[28:44.020 --> 28:47.500]  So that is something to keep in mind when you were thinking about your nutrient and
[28:47.500 --> 28:48.780]  feeding regimen.
[28:48.780 --> 28:54.380]  Are you going to be able to implement your integrated pest management system with your
[28:54.380 --> 28:56.620]  nutrient and soil selections?
[28:56.620 --> 28:59.000]  It's all got to work together.
[28:59.000 --> 29:05.360]  So those are basically the pros and cons of working with a living organic soil.
[29:05.360 --> 29:10.140]  Basically you've got an organic sustainable garden that should feel good to grow.
[29:10.140 --> 29:14.320]  The only real disadvantage that I can think of when it comes to growing in a living soil
[29:14.320 --> 29:18.120]  or an organic type environment is that it takes a lot of work ahead.
[29:18.120 --> 29:21.220]  There's a lot of work that has to happen before you start growing.
[29:21.220 --> 29:24.800]  But that work ahead may be exactly what some people want.
[29:24.800 --> 29:26.760]  That may be your style.
[29:26.760 --> 29:29.520]  Maybe you're one of the people that enjoy the smell of that rich dirt.
[29:29.520 --> 29:32.880]  Maybe you're the guy that enjoys mixing all those amendments together.
[29:32.880 --> 29:36.040]  Maybe you like having worm castings under your fingernails.
[29:36.040 --> 29:39.760]  Maybe you're into brewing your own compost teas or waiting for your own fermented plant
[29:39.760 --> 29:41.300]  juices to ferment.
[29:41.300 --> 29:44.880]  It's all about what makes you happy with your grow style.
[29:44.880 --> 29:49.240]  Also it's all about your abilities and what is available to you.
[29:49.240 --> 29:53.240]  If you live in a big city, maybe some of those organic amendments won't be as available to
[29:53.240 --> 29:54.240]  you.
[29:54.240 --> 29:58.440]  If you live in a small city, a small farm area, you'll have access to all of those organic
[29:58.440 --> 30:02.640]  inputs, but you may not have access to bottles and a hydro store.
[30:02.640 --> 30:05.200]  So it may come down to what's available in your area.
[30:05.200 --> 30:09.800]  Yes, most of us do have access to Amazon, but not everybody can afford everything on
[30:09.800 --> 30:10.800]  Amazon.
[30:10.800 --> 30:13.780]  So you may have to adjust to your budget as well.
[30:13.780 --> 30:17.660]  The main point of your garden is to produce a product that makes you happy.
[30:17.660 --> 30:21.320]  So as long as you are happy with your garden, as long as you're having fun, as long as you're
[30:21.320 --> 30:24.800]  enjoying yourself, and as long as you are getting a product at the end that makes you
[30:24.800 --> 30:26.880]  happy, you are doing it right.
[30:26.880 --> 30:29.080]  So set up a grow that you love.
[30:29.080 --> 30:30.080]  Are you the scientist?
[30:30.080 --> 30:34.280]  Do you want to be in there with a couple of measuring devices and bottles and measuring
[30:34.280 --> 30:36.880]  out 15 mils of this and pour it in?
[30:36.880 --> 30:40.160]  Now let's measure out 35 mils of this and pour it in and mix it.
[30:40.160 --> 30:42.600]  Now let's test the PPMs, see what that is.
[30:42.600 --> 30:43.640]  Ooh, that looks real good.
[30:43.640 --> 30:45.020]  Now let's adjust the pH.
[30:45.020 --> 30:46.320]  Now let's water the plants.
[30:46.320 --> 30:47.320]  Are you that guy?
[30:47.320 --> 30:51.640]  Or are you the guy that wants to mix up everything at the beginning and then just add water and
[30:51.640 --> 30:53.560]  then just watch the plants grow?
[30:53.560 --> 30:55.800]  Maybe you're the guy that wants to brew up a bunch of teas.
[30:55.800 --> 30:58.680]  Maybe you're that guy making the fermented plant juices.
[30:58.680 --> 30:59.680]  It's all up to you.
[30:59.680 --> 31:03.440]  You can be the scientist, you can be the farmer, you can be somewhere in between.
[31:03.440 --> 31:07.120]  As long as you are happy with your garden, that's really what matters.
[31:07.120 --> 31:09.520]  Now there are many more ways to feed your plants.
[31:09.520 --> 31:13.580]  I'm sure there are many more nutrient styles and fertilizing systems.
[31:13.580 --> 31:16.080]  One thing I should mention is aquaponics.
[31:16.120 --> 31:17.920]  I am not experienced in aquaponics.
[31:17.920 --> 31:21.720]  I can't teach you about aquaponics, but I feel like we would be leaving out all of our
[31:21.720 --> 31:26.800]  friends at the Growing With Fishes podcast if I didn't at least mention aquaponics as
[31:26.800 --> 31:31.480]  a very viable and sustainable way of fertilizing your cannabis garden.
[31:31.480 --> 31:33.920]  So big shout out to my friends at Growing With Fishes.
[31:33.920 --> 31:38.280]  I find it fascinating, but I do not have any experience, so I can't teach you anything
[31:38.280 --> 31:39.380]  about it.
[31:39.380 --> 31:46.500]  So that is my podcast about selecting nutrients and fertilizers for your new cannabis grow.
[31:46.500 --> 31:50.380]  Remember the most important part is that you are having fun and that you are happy with
[31:50.380 --> 31:52.280]  what comes out of your garden.
[31:52.280 --> 31:56.020]  Also try to keep in mind the ethics of whoever you are giving your money to.
[31:56.020 --> 32:00.340]  Try to shop with people who support our community and our industry.
[32:00.340 --> 32:04.380]  If I left anything out or if you've got anything you'd like to add, I would love to hear your
[32:04.380 --> 32:05.380]  feedback.
[32:05.380 --> 32:09.500]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[32:09.500 --> 32:12.540]  Don't be afraid to reach out if you feel like I missed something or if you've got something
[32:12.540 --> 32:13.540]  you'd like to add.
[32:13.540 --> 32:17.340]  I would love to include your information on a future episode.
