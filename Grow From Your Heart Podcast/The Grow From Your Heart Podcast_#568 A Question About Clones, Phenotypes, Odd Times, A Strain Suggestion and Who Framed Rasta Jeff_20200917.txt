[01:00.800 --> 01:05.360]  talking about what I'm smoking. Today I've been taking dabs of Fortissimo
[01:05.360 --> 01:09.880]  full-spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs. This is a blend of crescendo and
[01:09.880 --> 01:15.480]  HSB. The HSB is Han Solo Burger. On the package the flavor is described as 98
[01:15.480 --> 01:20.480]  octane dumpster and funk. That is completely accurate. When I crack this
[01:20.480 --> 01:24.960]  open it smells like a hot bar trash can. That doesn't sound like a pleasant
[01:24.960 --> 01:29.520]  description but I love it. There is some hot bar trash can what is the other one
[01:29.520 --> 01:34.720]  in here 98 octane I'm not sure the specific octane but I definitely get a
[01:34.720 --> 01:40.480]  funky gassy feely aroma. So the description of 98 octane dumpster and
[01:40.480 --> 01:45.440]  funk is completely accurate. It smells like a garlicky dumpster fire and I
[01:45.440 --> 01:50.240]  fucking love it. On the back of the package it says it contains 64.93%
[01:50.240 --> 01:54.920]  THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD. I'll show it to the camera there.
[01:54.920 --> 01:59.760]  Nice beautiful color nice chunky diamonds just enough terp sauce. Big
[01:59.760 --> 02:04.680]  shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the tremendous Fortissimo full
[02:04.680 --> 02:09.080]  spectrum extract. Alright ladies and gentlemen boys and girls pimps and hoes
[02:09.080 --> 02:12.320]  friends and foes smokers and growers clone cutters and pollen chuckers in
[02:12.320 --> 02:16.520]  this episode I'm going to read a couple of messages from patreon. Before we get
[02:16.520 --> 02:20.480]  to the message portion of the show let's do some shout outs to a few of the folks

[03:01.640 --> 03:03.860]  thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to
[03:03.860 --> 03:07.440]  support the show on Patreon. If you are not already supporting
[03:07.440 --> 03:10.100]  the show and you would like to learn how to do so all you have
[03:10.100 --> 03:15.120]  to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[03:15.120 --> 03:17.400]  heart all of the information you need is right there on the
[03:17.400 --> 03:20.700]  screen. Of course I did include a link in the show notes and in
[03:20.700 --> 03:24.660]  the video description to make it easy for my friends. And
[03:24.660 --> 03:28.380]  again, really thank you for all of the continued support. I will
[03:28.380 --> 03:31.820]  be updating those Patreon tiers very soon make a few more
[03:31.820 --> 03:34.380]  options make it a little bit easier for you guys to
[03:34.500 --> 03:37.060]  understand there's a lot going on on that page. I understand
[03:37.060 --> 03:39.780]  that I will make some adjustments. But anyway, thank
[03:39.780 --> 03:42.300]  you and shout out to the fortissimo for getting me
[03:42.300 --> 03:45.980]  rambly at the start of the show. All right, I don't want to waste
[03:45.980 --> 03:48.260]  too much time. I'm obviously nice and chattery. Let's jump
[03:48.260 --> 03:52.140]  right into the Patreon messages. Actually, before we get there,
[03:52.140 --> 03:54.380]  I've got an update. I almost skipped apart. It says update
[03:54.380 --> 03:58.300]  right here on my page. In a previous episode, I spoke about
[03:58.300 --> 04:01.640]  grafting and I said that I believe that when we do
[04:01.640 --> 04:04.260]  grafting and I said I have no science behind this. I said
[04:04.260 --> 04:07.020]  I've got no, no actual experience in this. I said this
[04:07.020 --> 04:10.220]  was my belief and my assumption. I believe that if we graft two
[04:10.220 --> 04:13.500]  plants together, eventually over time, those genetics will
[04:13.540 --> 04:18.180]  intermingle or meld or shift somehow to where that is one
[04:18.180 --> 04:20.660]  plant and I think the genetics will change the outcome, the
[04:20.660 --> 04:23.540]  flowers, the fruits of that plant will be different over
[04:23.540 --> 04:27.580]  time. Many people disagreed with me. Many people said that
[04:27.580 --> 04:30.220]  that was not a thing that the genetics will stay true to each
[04:30.220 --> 04:32.380]  branch of the plant. If you carefully label it, you'll know
[04:32.380 --> 04:37.260]  what it is forever. Well, I had another listener actually tag me
[04:37.260 --> 04:41.100]  in an article and send me a link to an article where it showed
[04:41.140 --> 04:45.080]  evidence of a plant changing its genetics. The plant used was a
[04:45.080 --> 04:49.120]  tobacco plant, but it did show that some genes did move around.
[04:49.200 --> 04:51.920]  So big shout out to my buddy Big Huff for tagging me in an
[04:51.920 --> 04:54.400]  article and pointing out the fact that I may have been
[04:54.400 --> 04:57.660]  correct the first time in my assumption and believing that if
[04:57.660 --> 05:01.480]  you graft a plant over time, eventually those genetics could
[05:01.480 --> 05:05.940]  and possibly will mingle or meld or whatever the scientific word
[05:05.940 --> 05:08.440]  is for that I'm being honest and open that I do not have the
[05:08.440 --> 05:11.720]  scientific education or terminology for this scenario.
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.400]  But in my grower knowledge mind, I feel like those genetics would
[05:16.400 --> 05:19.480]  definitely move around if you cut off if I cut off your arm,
[05:19.480 --> 05:22.000]  if we traded arms, cut off, we're gonna go with we're gonna
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.440]  do left leg. I don't fight to lose a limb, I would choose my
[05:24.440 --> 05:28.000]  left leg. That's a drummer thing. Cut off our left legs.
[05:28.160 --> 05:30.760]  You get my left leg, I get your left leg, we're gonna walk
[05:30.760 --> 05:33.540]  funny because I'm six five, I got long ass legs, you probably
[05:33.540 --> 05:35.860]  don't have legs as long as mine. I'm gonna walk funny, you're
[05:35.860 --> 05:40.920]  gonna walk funny. Over time, your leg and my leg, which is
[05:40.920 --> 05:42.920]  we've traded I don't know what to call these anymore. But our
[05:42.920 --> 05:46.040]  new legs are going to adapt and adjust to our body. It's not
[05:46.040 --> 05:47.960]  going to be your leg anymore. It's not going to be my leg
[05:47.960 --> 05:50.820]  anymore. It may still have your genes in it and my genes in it,
[05:50.820 --> 05:52.840]  but it's going to become mine. It's going to be part of my
[05:52.840 --> 05:56.180]  body. I think 20 years from now, if we're still alive, we won't
[05:56.180 --> 05:58.440]  even we'll still know that we got a leg transplant because
[05:58.440 --> 06:01.600]  it's fucking one's way longer. But our bodies will go that's my
[06:01.600 --> 06:03.920]  leg now. And it will be completely adjusted to it. Our
[06:03.920 --> 06:07.100]  genetics will have melded in and meshed in. We'll forget that
[06:07.100 --> 06:09.560]  that's somebody else's leg, our body will go that's my leg now
[06:09.560 --> 06:11.840]  and you're the old function just like your leg. This is all
[06:11.840 --> 06:14.600]  hypothetical. Don't take me too seriously. I think the plant
[06:14.600 --> 06:17.440]  will do the same thing. But oh, you gave me a new arm. Let's
[06:17.440 --> 06:20.360]  move around. And those genetics that make it cherry cush and
[06:20.360 --> 06:23.200]  those genetics that make it purple haze, they will you'll
[06:23.280 --> 06:25.660]  somehow you're not breeding but you're going to make a cherry
[06:25.660 --> 06:29.100]  haze sort of a thing out of that on accident in my opinion, and
[06:29.100 --> 06:32.720]  somebody has posted an article that says that did happen with
[06:32.720 --> 06:36.760]  different varietals of tobacco plants. So my first assumption
[06:36.760 --> 06:40.560]  and belief has been shown to have been accurate. I hope that
[06:40.560 --> 06:42.600]  stirred up more controversy because I look forward to
[06:42.600 --> 06:47.360]  hearing your feedback and your input on that update. So when I
[06:47.360 --> 06:49.800]  said that I feel like grafting will cause genetics to move I
[06:49.800 --> 06:51.960]  may have been right in my original assumption that was the
[06:51.960 --> 06:54.680]  short version of that long ramble. Now is the part when we
[06:54.680 --> 06:58.000]  are going to jump into the Patreon messages on this
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.920]  episode. And I mean at this time, this is not another false
[07:00.920 --> 07:04.160]  start. We're actually going to get into the Patreon messages.
[07:04.440 --> 07:07.480]  The first one comes from our friend tree star meadow who may
[07:07.480 --> 07:10.040]  have may have thought I forgot who he was, bro. I did not
[07:10.040 --> 07:13.080]  forget who you are. Thank you. I got nothing but love and support
[07:13.080 --> 07:15.920]  and respect for you and appreciation. This message goes
[07:16.080 --> 07:19.040]  like this. It says hey, Rasta Jeff tree star meadow here. I'm
[07:19.040 --> 07:22.120]  the guy who framed the orange gasm for you. Thank you. That is
[07:22.120 --> 07:25.400]  an amazing gift. I spoke briefly about it here on the show. Our
[07:25.400 --> 07:28.320]  friend tree star sent me a beautiful frame. It's thick.
[07:28.320 --> 07:30.840]  It's beautiful. It's got a lot of artwork going on to it. And
[07:30.840 --> 07:34.560]  inside of that frame is a framed package of orange gasm
[07:34.560 --> 07:37.160]  seeds. And he said that that orange gasm made his life
[07:37.160 --> 07:40.160]  easier. And he thanked me for making my life easier. He has no
[07:40.160 --> 07:43.280]  idea that the orange gasm has made my life easier. It's made
[07:43.280 --> 07:45.760]  my life better. That's been my number one seller lately. It's
[07:45.760 --> 07:48.320]  been paying the bill, so to speak. It has been my hit song.
[07:48.480 --> 07:51.840]  It's been the one making my company soar. So big thanks and
[07:51.840 --> 07:55.160]  big respect and big appreciation for the gift of the orange gasm
[07:55.280 --> 07:58.600]  framed package. That was beautiful. It goes on to say I
[07:58.600 --> 08:01.000]  was listening to your podcast today and I felt it was high
[08:01.000 --> 08:04.800]  time get it high time I got on Patreon and became a supporter
[08:04.800 --> 08:08.840]  of you and also the DGC. Big thank you. I appreciate that.
[08:09.040 --> 08:12.320]  Our friend tree star signed up to support myself and the DGC on
[08:12.320 --> 08:15.720]  Patreon today. I do appreciate that and coming from the DGC.
[08:15.800 --> 08:19.240]  Thank you. They appreciate it as well. It goes on to say it goes
[08:19.240 --> 08:21.640]  without saying you've been a tremendous help in making me a
[08:21.640 --> 08:24.760]  better grower. It's only right that I support you financially
[08:24.760 --> 08:27.760]  after all you've done for me. I spend my weekdays alone,
[08:27.960 --> 08:30.720]  building and shipping squares and rectangles from a small
[08:30.720 --> 08:34.240]  industrial warehouse. It's the voices of Rasta Jeff, Scotty
[08:34.240 --> 08:37.920]  guru and the dude that keep me company. Man I love knowing that
[08:37.920 --> 08:40.200]  I'm keeping you company and I think I have a good hint at what
[08:40.200 --> 08:44.200]  you do all day because you sent me a box. Man I'm glad that we
[08:44.200 --> 08:46.280]  were able to keep you sane because that type of a job would
[08:46.280 --> 08:49.480]  drive me crazy. I need some sort of variation some sort of chaos
[08:49.480 --> 08:52.560]  in my life. So I'm glad that we're able to keep you sane. And
[08:52.560 --> 08:55.040]  thank you for noticing that you've gotten a vast education
[08:55.040 --> 08:57.880]  from me and made you a better grower. That's my goal. Knowing
[08:57.880 --> 09:01.080]  that I made you a better grower. That is my goal. I love the
[09:01.080 --> 09:03.720]  Patreon contributions. Don't get me wrong. I love financial
[09:03.720 --> 09:06.480]  support that makes life better. It makes things fun. But just
[09:06.480 --> 09:09.040]  knowing that somebody out there is enjoying their garden more
[09:09.120 --> 09:11.160]  having a more successful outcome. That's what the show
[09:11.160 --> 09:13.960]  was about in the first place. So that means a lot to me. I should
[09:13.960 --> 09:16.840]  keep moving because I am fucking rambly. It says, even though
[09:16.840 --> 09:19.360]  we've never met, I feel like I hang out with you guys all the
[09:19.360 --> 09:22.360]  time I get to learn and laugh concurrently. And to me it is
[09:22.360 --> 09:27.440]  worth my $10 a month. I know exactly what you feel. I listen
[09:27.440 --> 09:30.720]  to a lot of podcasts as well. One of my favorite podcasts,
[09:30.720 --> 09:33.280]  maybe possibly one of my ads, one of my top five favorite
[09:33.280 --> 09:35.560]  podcasts, a couple of my favorite podcasts actually have
[09:35.560 --> 09:38.480]  been disrupted lately. The church of what's happening now
[09:38.480 --> 09:42.200]  with Joey Diaz is done. Joey Diaz has moved back to New
[09:42.200 --> 09:45.440]  Jersey because there's no point in being in LA. He doesn't have
[09:45.440 --> 09:48.440]  his producer anymore. That was one of my favorite podcasts. It
[09:48.440 --> 09:52.240]  is gone. I would listen to Uncle Joey on a daily basis a lot like
[09:52.240 --> 09:55.360]  you guys listen to me. And I felt like I'm friends with Joey.
[09:55.360 --> 09:58.040]  I've met Joey. I've smoked some concentrates with Joey before I
[09:58.040 --> 10:00.560]  been around Joey hung out with Joey. But it was like keeping up
[10:00.560 --> 10:03.240]  with my friend every day via that podcast. And when that
[10:03.240 --> 10:07.480]  podcast ended, I miss Uncle Joey. I'm not getting part of my
[10:07.480 --> 10:10.520]  entertainment. Part of my life is missing. COVID didn't really
[10:10.640 --> 10:13.320]  hit me too hard until all of my entertainment started going
[10:13.320 --> 10:16.720]  away. That's what I'm noticing. So I feel like I know Uncle Joey
[10:16.720 --> 10:19.240]  and I feel like I miss him. So I understand exactly where you're
[10:19.240 --> 10:21.480]  coming from. The other podcast that disappeared on me is the
[10:21.480 --> 10:24.280]  fighter and the kid. If you're a T fat K fan, you understand
[10:24.280 --> 10:27.800]  what happened there. I miss seeing that old gay owl on the
[10:27.800 --> 10:30.440]  other couch. I really do. And if you're a T fat K fan, you
[10:30.440 --> 10:33.360]  understand exactly what I'm talking about. I miss Callan on
[10:33.400 --> 10:36.040]  that red couch seeing the other guys on the red couches just
[10:36.040 --> 10:39.920]  doesn't do it for me. I miss my bro Callan. So I understand
[10:39.920 --> 10:43.960]  exactly what you mean about hanging out with me. I consume a
[10:43.960 --> 10:46.840]  lot of podcasts. So I feel the exact thing. And I actually
[10:46.920 --> 10:50.520]  since I hit a certain tier on my Patreon, I've gone and started
[10:50.520 --> 10:53.840]  contributing to other podcasts that I enjoy, because I felt
[10:53.840 --> 10:56.280]  that it was time to give back the karma. So thank you for
[10:56.280 --> 10:58.800]  throwing me 10 bucks and throwing the dude grows crew 10
[10:58.800 --> 11:02.320]  bucks. I actually contributed to Mike's Patreon because Mike
[11:02.320 --> 11:04.680]  comes on my show and helps me out. I figured it was my
[11:04.680 --> 11:07.600]  responsibility to contribute to white Mike's Patreon and say
[11:07.600 --> 11:10.800]  thanks to Mike. Also, I contributed to Joey Diaz, of
[11:10.800 --> 11:13.440]  course, and the fighter and the kid or not the fighter and the
[11:13.440 --> 11:17.080]  kid I rejected my fighter I read revoked it because I didn't like
[11:17.080 --> 11:20.120]  what they gave me. But the the king of the sting they get a
[11:20.120 --> 11:22.720]  couple bucks from me, but I did go do some contributions because
[11:22.720 --> 11:26.120]  you guys are hooking me up so fat. Let's get back on track
[11:26.160 --> 11:29.200]  here at least a little tiny bit. It says I'm glad you loved your
[11:29.200 --> 11:32.280]  frame. I wanted to make sure you received the note was included
[11:32.280 --> 11:36.360]  with it. That was the most important part. The note meant a
[11:36.360 --> 11:39.640]  lot to me the whole package was beautiful and meant a lot to me.
[11:39.840 --> 11:42.240]  I knew that my mom was going to be showing up in my house later
[11:42.240 --> 11:46.560]  that day. So I left the framed package and the note laying on
[11:46.600 --> 11:49.320]  the table where I knew she would walk by and just curiously pick
[11:49.320 --> 11:51.840]  it up and read it. And it was left out there invitingly she
[11:51.840 --> 11:54.120]  wasn't invading space or anything by reading that I left
[11:54.120 --> 11:56.640]  it there to be read and she read it. And she told me later she's
[11:56.640 --> 11:58.520]  like whoever wrote that is really nice. That's a really
[11:58.520 --> 12:01.320]  sweet thing for someone to say. And she even felt like the look
[12:01.320 --> 12:03.640]  on her face I could see the sincerity that she felt your
[12:03.640 --> 12:06.280]  note. So yeah, that was really cool. Thank you. I did
[12:06.280 --> 12:09.280]  appreciate it. I felt every word of that. That stuff means a lot
[12:09.280 --> 12:11.880]  to me. I do a lot of work. Sometimes I don't realize
[12:11.880 --> 12:14.720]  exactly how many lives I've touched. So your thank you note
[12:14.720 --> 12:17.920]  did go a long way. I'm building a new office space. I've been
[12:17.920 --> 12:20.200]  saying that for a couple of weeks. I needed some plants to
[12:20.200 --> 12:22.600]  harvest ahead my office was a grow room for a minute, you
[12:22.600 --> 12:25.000]  know, things that breeders do. I'm going to rebuild the office
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.720]  space and that will definitely go in a spot where I look
[12:27.720 --> 12:30.600]  frequently because I want to see that and be reminded of that
[12:30.600 --> 12:33.240]  quite often. It's going to get its own dedicated little spot.
[12:33.280 --> 12:37.240]  So thank you. There's more. It says thank you for doing what
[12:37.240 --> 12:40.760]  you do. I'm off to take a fat dab. And as soon as we're able
[12:40.760 --> 12:45.520]  to travel, I'll give my mom a hug for you. Much love. They
[12:45.520 --> 12:49.400]  signed it with their real name and then tree star meadow, bro.
[12:49.400 --> 12:52.000]  I'll never forget who you are. I'll never forget that package
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.600]  that you sent me that will always mean a lot to me. While
[12:54.600 --> 12:58.680]  you're off traveling on giving your mom a hug. Why don't you
[12:58.680 --> 13:02.000]  come take a dab with me if we could travel we could do some
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.480]  shit. I owe you a dab. I owe you a high five. Come take a dab
[13:05.480 --> 13:07.920]  with me. You're always invited. I look forward to meeting you
[13:07.920 --> 13:10.520]  tree star. Thank you for the great message. Let's keep
[13:10.520 --> 13:13.200]  moving you guys because I am rambling I can get way off track
[13:13.200 --> 13:16.440]  in this podcast. So let's stay focused. Let's keep this choo
[13:16.440 --> 13:19.120]  choo train on the rails just a little bit. I've got another
[13:19.120 --> 13:22.880]  great Patreon question. This one is a series of questions that
[13:22.880 --> 13:27.440]  comes from our friend Wyatt herb and it goes a lot like this. It
[13:27.440 --> 13:30.680]  says yo Rasta Jeff, I took your Patreon advice on your podcast
[13:30.680 --> 13:32.840]  today and I'm sending you a message I wanted to check that
[13:32.840 --> 13:36.800]  my $7 and 10 cent level is okay. And if I would be included in
[13:36.800 --> 13:40.680]  the shout outs I love your show brother. Best podcast by far.
[13:41.120 --> 13:44.440]  That was the first message from Wyatt herb. Yes, brother, I did
[13:44.440 --> 13:48.120]  receive your contribution and the $7 and 10 cent level is
[13:48.120 --> 13:52.200]  exactly what you need to get a shout out on the show. So shout
[13:52.200 --> 13:54.680]  out to Wyatt herb. I think you did get a shout out at the start
[13:54.680 --> 13:56.760]  of this show. If you didn't, it's coming up. I write them
[13:56.760 --> 13:58.920]  down at the start of the show and I tried to do about 10 you
[13:58.920 --> 14:01.440]  did get a shout out the start of this one. Try to give about nine
[14:01.440 --> 14:04.280]  to 12 shout outs depending on how long your names are. So
[14:04.320 --> 14:06.120]  that's where the shout outs fall into place. You got to throw
[14:06.120 --> 14:09.800]  down 10 $7 and 10 cents on the Patreon and then I write down 10
[14:09.800 --> 14:12.600]  or 12 of them at the start of each episode to throw out your
[14:12.600 --> 14:16.120]  Patreon did make it this one showing too many people's names
[14:16.120 --> 14:18.560]  reading through the paper up here, but your Patreon message
[14:18.560 --> 14:21.000]  did make it and you do get a shout out. So once again, shout
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.960]  out to Wyatt herb. Thank you for the contribution. I want to keep
[14:23.960 --> 14:28.400]  going. There is more. It goes. Also a request and a question if
[14:28.400 --> 14:31.360]  you don't mind good sir. Have you watched that Danny Carey
[14:31.360 --> 14:34.720]  drum video Numa asked you on your Instagram Live I know you
[14:34.720 --> 14:37.480]  weren't a big tool fan. But every time you talk about drums,
[14:37.640 --> 14:40.720]  I think about how you must watch the solo at six minutes and 30
[14:40.720 --> 14:44.040]  seconds in is crazy. The time signature is nuts for accounts
[14:44.040 --> 14:47.760]  ain't happening. Watch it for the craft. That is a great
[14:47.760 --> 14:49.920]  comment. There is cannabis related content in this
[14:49.920 --> 14:55.240]  question. Um, I am a huge musician, a huge music fan. I've
[14:55.240 --> 14:58.000]  been playing the drum since I was 14 or 15 years old. That's
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.560]  quite a bit of time. If you know how old I am by now. I've been
[15:00.560 --> 15:03.000]  playing for a while I can count odd times I could get a good
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.640]  feel for shit. A lot of people sent me that exact video. I
[15:08.640 --> 15:11.320]  don't know what happened. That video must have gotten popular
[15:11.320 --> 15:13.720]  must have been trending or something on the same day that I
[15:13.720 --> 15:16.640]  said something about the drums because three or four people
[15:16.640 --> 15:19.360]  sent me that video within a three or four day time period.
[15:19.520 --> 15:22.800]  Also somebody that means a lot to me as a huge tool fan. I
[15:22.800 --> 15:25.600]  thought it would be time to give that song a listen and learn it
[15:25.640 --> 15:29.240]  a little bit. I've got the idea of the song but I don't have all
[15:29.240 --> 15:32.640]  of the parts memorized and comfortably figured out but I
[15:32.640 --> 15:35.320]  know I can count it. I know the time signatures I know the
[15:35.320 --> 15:38.480]  pieces I know the changes. It's just comfortably flowing with
[15:38.480 --> 15:41.480]  that is going to take me a minute but I can do it. So not
[15:41.480 --> 15:44.040]  there yet. I can get to it I can I'll be able to play the whole
[15:44.040 --> 15:46.600]  thing all the way through that won't be a too big of a deal in
[15:46.600 --> 15:49.200]  a year. I'll be knocking that out. It may take a year but it's
[15:49.200 --> 15:50.920]  only because I just get to play a little bit and practice on
[15:50.920 --> 15:54.120]  that just a little bit but yeah, it's a fun song. I'll get there.
[15:54.200 --> 15:56.400]  I know you guys this is not cannabis related but it was a
[15:56.400 --> 16:00.480]  great question. So many people sent me that that video all like
[16:00.480 --> 16:03.080]  within a week and I was like this is a sign and then you
[16:03.080 --> 16:04.960]  asked me Hey, have you tried that and I was like I'm gonna go
[16:04.960 --> 16:07.920]  fucking try this so I listened to it. I wrote down the exact
[16:07.920 --> 16:10.280]  date of the first time I attempted to play it. So I've
[16:10.280 --> 16:12.640]  got that written down. I think it was the fourth of September.
[16:13.160 --> 16:15.480]  So that means by I don't know six months from now I should
[16:15.480 --> 16:17.800]  have some solid progress on it. I know that sounds like a long
[16:17.800 --> 16:20.800]  time but it is a monster of a song. It's going to be a lot of
[16:20.800 --> 16:23.880]  fun or to be a lot of exercise as well. For accounts ain't
[16:23.880 --> 16:26.960]  happening. That drum solo in the middle is all for bro. It's just
[16:26.960 --> 16:31.600]  a camouflaged for the different feel the rest of it is five and
[16:31.600 --> 16:36.320]  six. It's 12345612345 with a couple of one twos right in the
[16:36.320 --> 16:38.720]  middle of there to fuck up the pattern. Let's get back on
[16:38.720 --> 16:41.520]  talking about cannabis. It says I do have questions for you.
[16:42.200 --> 16:45.960]  What are the options for us deep in prohibition land to buy legit
[16:45.960 --> 16:49.080]  clones? I've always wanted to grow a real deal cut but I have
[16:49.080 --> 16:53.080]  no idea who to trust or if the stuff online is credible I'm in
[16:53.080 --> 16:54.640]  I'm not even going to say your state because I don't want to
[16:54.640 --> 16:57.600]  give any hints of where you are. Since you're talking about
[16:57.600 --> 17:00.560]  being in prohibition land, I'm in prohibition land. So the local
[17:00.560 --> 17:03.760]  scene is basically non existent. I know I can try the trade game,
[17:03.880 --> 17:07.360]  but I'm not extremely handy in forms etc. And I don't hear much
[17:07.360 --> 17:12.280]  about the online clone sales at all any help. The clone game can
[17:12.280 --> 17:15.240]  be a risky game. The only if you don't know other growers if
[17:15.240 --> 17:17.920]  there's not a growing community in your neighborhood, if you
[17:17.920 --> 17:20.160]  don't know anybody with clones, you're going to have to rely on
[17:20.160 --> 17:22.800]  the internet, you're gonna have to rely on forums or social
[17:22.800 --> 17:26.080]  media or something that can be risky. You don't know what
[17:26.080 --> 17:28.520]  you're going to get, I can almost guarantee you're going to
[17:28.520 --> 17:32.360]  get spider mites, powdery mildew thrips, some sort of fungus
[17:32.360 --> 17:35.560]  gnats or some sort of problems. Those always come free with
[17:35.560 --> 17:38.200]  clones expect that that's just part of doing business when it
[17:38.200 --> 17:42.440]  comes to getting clones. I don't recommend if you don't have a
[17:42.440 --> 17:46.960]  trusted reliable source, I just don't recommend doing it unless
[17:46.960 --> 17:50.160]  you're really desperate and hard up for a new variety that you
[17:50.160 --> 17:52.920]  really, really need something new in the garden. Maybe go on
[17:52.920 --> 17:55.760]  a forum find somebody doing it but you've got to trust the
[17:55.760 --> 17:58.480]  seller and the sender that thing is going to end up coming to you
[17:58.480 --> 18:01.800]  in the mail. Did they label it so where it doesn't look like
[18:01.800 --> 18:04.160]  it's a fucking clone? Did they package it safely to where it
[18:04.160 --> 18:06.400]  doesn't look like it's a clone. You don't want to set yourself
[18:06.400 --> 18:08.840]  up to get in trouble from somebody you don't even know
[18:08.840 --> 18:11.920]  who's careless. I like to kind of vet people learn how they do
[18:11.920 --> 18:14.620]  business, see how they do things how they do one thing is how
[18:14.620 --> 18:16.920]  they do all things. If they're sloppy in one aspect, they're
[18:16.920 --> 18:18.800]  going to be sloppy when they send you shit. Don't deal
[18:18.800 --> 18:21.000]  business. Don't deal with them. Don't do business with them.
[18:21.000 --> 18:25.440]  They can put you in trouble. I don't know what else to say for
[18:25.720 --> 18:27.800]  them. I stuttered hard. They're not even gonna edit. I don't
[18:27.800 --> 18:31.240]  know what else to tell you or to say when it comes to getting
[18:31.240 --> 18:35.400]  clones. Like be very careful. Like you said that the forums
[18:35.400 --> 18:38.180]  and shit are going to be your best bet. But who knows if those
[18:38.180 --> 18:40.600]  people are even going to send you what you asked for. There's
[18:40.600 --> 18:43.460]  no reason for somebody to fake you and say they've got
[18:43.460 --> 18:45.880]  something but it's a good way to make money. If I know you're
[18:45.880 --> 18:48.360]  looking for granddaddy purple clones. I've got granddaddy
[18:48.360 --> 18:50.760]  purple clone suddenly, if you're looking for lemon haze
[18:50.760 --> 18:53.000]  clones, I know I've got lemon haze clone suddenly, it's just
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  how some people are. That's how that's going to work. So be very
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.320]  careful when it comes to clone shopping online. I don't have
[18:59.320 --> 19:02.400]  much advice for that I would say find some grower friends and
[19:02.400 --> 19:05.360]  trade cuts directly with them when you get those cuts. Put
[19:05.360 --> 19:08.560]  them into quarantine. Treat them like they've got bugs treat them
[19:08.560 --> 19:11.800]  for about two weeks in another room if you can treat them every
[19:11.800 --> 19:14.500]  third day with different pesticides, maybe combinations
[19:14.500 --> 19:16.800]  of pesticides, pay attention to them, treat them with the
[19:16.800 --> 19:19.120]  fungicide, get rid of all the problems that they could come
[19:19.120 --> 19:22.840]  with. Like I said, clones come with free problems. So treat
[19:22.840 --> 19:25.240]  them for that. I'm trying to think of better advice while I'm
[19:25.240 --> 19:30.240]  rambling. If you want real deal cuts, I think the best way to do
[19:30.240 --> 19:34.640]  it is to shop for s one seeds of the cuts that you're hot for.
[19:34.880 --> 19:39.000]  This is basically why I made golden goat feminine I seeds
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.160]  golden goat was a really popular cut when I started kind of
[19:42.160 --> 19:44.880]  coming up in the breeding game and making seeds to give out in
[19:44.880 --> 19:48.000]  bulk quantities to people golden goat was the big hot
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.880]  shit in my scene. So I reversed the golden goat. My intention
[19:51.880 --> 19:55.480]  was I can't send clones out to everybody but I can get seeds to
[19:55.480 --> 19:59.880]  everybody. So if you get s one seeds, that is as close as
[19:59.880 --> 20:02.600]  you're going to get to getting a clone of a certain cultivar
[20:02.600 --> 20:05.480]  without running the risk of having a clone mailed to you
[20:05.480 --> 20:08.040]  without that clone not being what you're told it is without
[20:08.160 --> 20:11.000]  getting the bugs and problems that come with the clone. So I
[20:11.000 --> 20:15.360]  think seeds are going to be the closest option. And again, s one
[20:15.360 --> 20:18.360]  seeds are self seeds. That's when you take a cultivar, you
[20:18.360 --> 20:21.320]  treat it with a solution, take the pollen from that plant and
[20:21.320 --> 20:24.680]  put it on another clone of the same plant. You've used to girl
[20:24.680 --> 20:27.560]  plants you treated one with some magic. Now those are going to
[20:27.560 --> 20:31.520]  make feminized seeds, you've got s one feminized seeds, no
[20:31.520 --> 20:34.360]  adulteration of the genetics, it's going to be as close as you
[20:34.360 --> 20:38.120]  can find to that strain without getting a dirty clone without
[20:38.120 --> 20:41.240]  outcrossing it or something like that. So I don't have good
[20:41.240 --> 20:44.560]  advice on getting legit clones buying legit clones. If you're
[20:44.560 --> 20:47.080]  going to buy stuff like that online, be very careful. You
[20:47.080 --> 20:49.480]  have to trust the seller, you have to trust the shipper, you
[20:49.480 --> 20:52.120]  put yourself in a lot of positions that way. Once you get
[20:52.120 --> 20:55.400]  the clone, is it contaminated, infected, infested? And is it
[20:55.400 --> 20:59.040]  even indeed what you are told it's labeled as? That's a big
[20:59.040 --> 21:02.280]  gamble, I would recommend you get some feminized s one seeds
[21:02.320 --> 21:06.400]  from a reliable breeder from a reliable seed seller. Of course,
[21:06.400 --> 21:10.400]  I do recommend seeds here now.com and use coupon code GFYH10
[21:10.400 --> 21:14.200]  while you do that. If you want some blueberry cookies, s ones,
[21:14.200 --> 21:16.960]  I've made those available. That is the Leonardo. If you want
[21:16.960 --> 21:20.840]  golden goat feminized seeds, the s ones are available. Those are
[21:20.840 --> 21:24.080]  both available at seeds here now.com. Let me know what you're
[21:24.080 --> 21:27.040]  looking for. Maybe I can help you find some s ones. Maybe.
[21:27.840 --> 21:30.720]  Let's keep moving. There is more to this. I keep sitting on this
[21:30.720 --> 21:33.120]  big dreadlock. If you see me keeping keep reaching behind me
[21:33.120 --> 21:34.840]  trying to get this dread out from under me. It's driving me
[21:34.840 --> 21:38.080]  crazy. None of your worry. Let's keep moving. It goes.
[21:38.120 --> 21:42.080]  Uh, where are we? I'm moving. I'm loving my iRegenetics. I
[21:42.080 --> 21:44.320]  have four of your strains in my room now and I couldn't be
[21:44.320 --> 21:47.000]  happier. Thank you, brother. Lots of love. That is a great
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.440]  compliment. I want to know which four you're growing and I would
[21:49.440 --> 21:52.680]  love to see photos of those four. You're running four
[21:52.680 --> 21:54.840]  strains. I want to know which four you've got together. And
[21:54.840 --> 21:56.840]  I'm glad that you couldn't be happier. That means a lot to me.
[21:56.840 --> 21:59.880]  I love that my product is making you happy. Then it says here's a
[21:59.880 --> 22:02.960]  great question. Do you think I could get a blue raspberry
[22:02.960 --> 22:07.360]  truffle pheno from a bebop seed since they have the two strain
[22:07.360 --> 22:10.560]  combos and he means the two same parents or will the sex of the
[22:10.560 --> 22:16.680]  parents limit what traits they can express? Um, so the story
[22:16.680 --> 22:20.200]  here is blue raspberry truffle is an arise to blueberry
[22:20.200 --> 22:23.480]  cookies. It's an arise male pollinated a blueberry cookies.
[22:23.720 --> 22:27.440]  The bebop is the opposite. I reversed blueberry cookies to
[22:27.440 --> 22:31.640]  make pollen and pollinated my female arise. So you're going to
[22:31.640 --> 22:35.920]  find vast differences because the male was completely
[22:35.920 --> 22:39.680]  different. The female arise and the male arise are different
[22:39.680 --> 22:43.280]  plants. If I was using if they were both reversed and done that
[22:43.280 --> 22:46.320]  way, you'd find more common phenotypes and you'd be more
[22:46.320 --> 22:49.160]  likely to find the blue raspberry truffle in there. But
[22:49.160 --> 22:54.520]  since I used the female arise, that kind of takes away from the
[22:54.520 --> 22:57.000]  opportunity to get the blue rat. You'll still find it but it's
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.240]  not the same male that's two different. It's a different
[22:59.240 --> 23:01.840]  plant in the mix. It's not the male, it's the female, which
[23:01.840 --> 23:04.440]  will carry different traits, but it is an opportunity. It is a
[23:04.440 --> 23:07.320]  possibility, because you've still got those two flavors in
[23:07.320 --> 23:12.720]  the mix. Also, you're going to see more of the male most of the
[23:12.720 --> 23:15.520]  time you're going to find more of the male kind of carries the
[23:15.520 --> 23:17.960]  structure and the shape a little bit. So that's what you're
[23:17.960 --> 23:19.280]  going to see different, you're going to see more of the
[23:19.280 --> 23:23.440]  blueberry cookie shape, and less of the arise shape in that plant
[23:23.520 --> 23:26.880]  is what I think you're going to find. So it is possible. But
[23:26.880 --> 23:30.840]  since I used the arise number four female and not the King
[23:30.840 --> 23:33.360]  Solomon male, you're going to see differences because those
[23:33.360 --> 23:35.440]  are two different plants. They're from the same line, the
[23:35.440 --> 23:37.800]  same progeny, but they're, they're different. They're,
[23:37.800 --> 23:43.280]  they were selected for different traits. So it is possible. With
[23:43.280 --> 23:46.600]  the two strain combos, yes. But you'd be if you want the blue
[23:46.600 --> 23:48.880]  raspberry truffle, you'd be better off getting the blue
[23:48.880 --> 23:51.800]  raspberry truffle. That's what I think. All right. Wyatt Erb, I
[23:51.800 --> 23:54.240]  think that is the end of your message. Yes, I've got one more
[23:54.240 --> 23:56.280]  message to go. I want to thank you for the great message.
[23:56.280 --> 23:58.680]  And if anybody else out there would like to join the Patreon
[23:58.680 --> 24:01.280]  and get your question moved up to the top, it is patreon.com
[24:01.280 --> 24:04.240]  forward slash grow from your heart. Also, I will answer your
[24:04.240 --> 24:07.080]  questions via email. The email address is grow from your heart
[24:07.080 --> 24:09.960]  at hotmail.com. Of course, Patreon is the way to move your
[24:09.960 --> 24:13.720]  message right up to the top. I do have another message that
[24:13.720 --> 24:16.920]  comes from a longtime Patreon supporter. This one comes from
[24:16.920 --> 24:20.560]  Mr. Glenn Geroni. It says Jeff, you can obviously use my name if
[24:20.560 --> 24:22.720]  this makes it to the podcast. That's good. Because when I hold
[24:22.720 --> 24:26.120]  up the message, your name shows up real big through the
[24:26.120 --> 24:30.360]  paper. So big shout out to Glenn Geroni. This message goes like
[24:30.360 --> 24:33.520]  this. As I approach the first two rooms of my commercial grow
[24:33.520 --> 24:36.360]  coming to the final date. I'm wondering whether or not to
[24:36.360 --> 24:42.560]  flush with pH RO water or just regular RO water. Normally I add
[24:42.560 --> 24:45.640]  my newts and my pH is right on the money. However, I would
[24:45.640 --> 24:49.520]  prefer not to add pH down to water if it is not necessary.
[24:49.760 --> 24:53.760]  RO is what we have to use due to small amounts of aluminum of
[24:53.760 --> 24:58.640]  aluminum in the well water. Alright, so our friend Glenn
[24:58.640 --> 25:04.120]  Geroni is coming up on their, what is it the the first two
[25:04.120 --> 25:06.960]  rooms of their commercial grow. Congratulations on the first
[25:06.960 --> 25:09.560]  harvest in your commercial grow. That's exciting. And he's
[25:09.560 --> 25:14.640]  wondering if he should flush with pH or not pH RO water. He's
[25:14.640 --> 25:18.520]  using reverse osmosis water. He says without adjusting the pH,
[25:18.520 --> 25:23.240]  it comes out at 6.9 to 7.2. That's just about neutral. Let's
[25:23.240 --> 25:27.120]  see. He's wondering if he should adjust the pH to 5.9 to
[25:27.120 --> 25:31.200]  6.1. Normally he adds newts and the pH is right on the money at
[25:31.200 --> 25:35.040]  6.0. Right now he doesn't want to add pH down to the water if
[25:35.040 --> 25:39.640]  it's not necessary. Wants to know if it will be okay to flush
[25:39.640 --> 25:44.760]  with the current RO water. When we're flushing, we're basically
[25:44.760 --> 25:49.000]  trying to rinse out the medium that is holding the plants. We
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.400]  just want to get the soil, the cocoa, we want to rinse that
[25:51.400 --> 25:55.120]  out. So there's nothing left for the plant to eat. So if
[25:55.120 --> 25:59.080]  you're using RO water, RO water will stop the plant from
[25:59.120 --> 26:03.600]  uptaking more nutrients. When the water is pH, it is able to
[26:03.600 --> 26:06.920]  uptake nutrients. If it is at the wrong pH, it can't uptake
[26:06.920 --> 26:09.800]  nutrients. So it's not going to eat anymore. So I don't find a
[26:09.800 --> 26:14.280]  reason to pH the flushing water. You're trying to make that plant
[26:14.280 --> 26:16.960]  cannibalize itself and stop eating. You basically just want
[26:16.960 --> 26:20.600]  to get water through there. So water on your normal, this is
[26:20.600 --> 26:23.360]  something I want to clear up as well. I say when we're flushing,
[26:23.480 --> 26:27.960]  feed clean water for two weeks until it's harvest time. I don't
[26:27.960 --> 26:32.000]  mean water every day for two weeks. And I'm sure Glen Geroni
[26:32.000 --> 26:33.920]  is smart enough here for this. This is for some people that
[26:33.920 --> 26:36.640]  were confused when they were listening. What I mean is water
[26:36.640 --> 26:39.760]  on your normal schedule. If you're going to harvest in 14
[26:39.760 --> 26:44.280]  days, today, water till you get about 20% runoff. Wait for that
[26:44.280 --> 26:47.920]  plant to dry until it's thirsty again, then water until you get
[26:47.920 --> 26:51.760]  20% runoff with just clean, plain water that will flush out
[26:51.760 --> 26:56.000]  the plants. I do not mean fucking drown the plant every
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.200]  day until it's running off 20%. That will kill your plant, your
[26:59.200 --> 27:01.800]  plant will be dead, you won't get time to flush it. Four days
[27:01.800 --> 27:04.040]  into the flush phase, it's fucking over. You're gonna blame
[27:04.040 --> 27:07.960]  it on me. Don't do that. Water it heavily till you get 20%
[27:07.960 --> 27:11.920]  runoff. Let it dry up maybe even a little extra dry. Do it all
[27:11.920 --> 27:14.640]  over again. You should get three, five times of that
[27:14.640 --> 27:16.840]  depending on how often you water your plants, you should get
[27:16.840 --> 27:19.600]  three to five good fucking flushes out of that. And that
[27:19.600 --> 27:22.360]  will make your plants burn well. There's a lot of stuff that can
[27:22.360 --> 27:25.080]  go into a flushing conversation. What are you trying to flush
[27:25.080 --> 27:27.160]  out a lot of the stuff you're trying to flush out has actually
[27:27.160 --> 27:29.480]  been turned into buds. What are you actually flushing? You can't
[27:29.480 --> 27:32.240]  remove the stuff from the buds. I don't think I'm not sure I'm
[27:32.240 --> 27:34.560]  still learning still reading still digging into that
[27:34.560 --> 27:37.320]  controversy. But we just want to clean the soil so the plants
[27:37.320 --> 27:42.040]  will quit eating. I think that not adjusting the pH, the plants
[27:42.040 --> 27:43.680]  aren't going to eat, they're going to drink still they're
[27:43.680 --> 27:45.720]  going to get water, but they're not going to uptake any
[27:45.720 --> 27:48.240]  nutrients. And that is our goal. So I don't find it
[27:48.240 --> 27:52.120]  necessary to adjust the pH of the water at the end of the
[27:52.120 --> 27:54.760]  flowering phase. That's going to make it a lot easier in your
[27:54.760 --> 27:56.800]  commercial grow that's going to save you a step that's going to
[27:56.800 --> 27:59.600]  save you money on a product. You don't have to put the pen in
[27:59.600 --> 28:02.600]  there and stir it around and try to get it at the right pH. I say
[28:02.600 --> 28:05.560]  go for it. Just water the shit out of them. All right. The next
[28:05.560 --> 28:09.440]  question says, what feminized genetics does I read genetics
[28:09.440 --> 28:11.920]  offer that you would recommend for a commercial grow I can
[28:11.920 --> 28:14.520]  create whatever environment each particular cultivar needs with
[28:14.520 --> 28:17.840]  no problems. I'm wanting quality first and quantity
[28:17.840 --> 28:20.640]  second. You'll get both with the strain I'm going to recommend.
[28:21.040 --> 28:24.720]  So what do you suggest I run of yours in my commercial grow and
[28:24.720 --> 28:27.800]  he said feminized seeds. So right now I'm going to strongly
[28:27.800 --> 28:31.760]  recommend orange chasm. Orange chasm is the fucking winner in
[28:31.760 --> 28:35.000]  a commercial grow for feminized seeds. It puts out good fat
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.360]  harvest. It doesn't take super long to finish. It's got mad bag
[28:38.360 --> 28:41.280]  appeal. It smells like delicious oranges. If you want to make
[28:41.280 --> 28:43.880]  concentrates out of it, the concentrates just smell like
[28:44.200 --> 28:48.600]  orange candy. It's easy to grow. It'll suck up a lot of nutrients
[28:48.600 --> 28:52.120]  though you got to feed the shit out of it but it can take abuse.
[28:52.240 --> 28:55.280]  It can take all kinds of rooms. If your room is too hot, too
[28:55.280 --> 28:58.680]  cold, too humid, too dry, it's going to be okay. I heavily
[28:58.720 --> 29:03.400]  strongly highly recommend orange chasm from my feminine feminized
[29:03.400 --> 29:07.560]  lineup for your commercial grow. So then it also says there are
[29:07.640 --> 29:11.040]  picks up attached. I saw the pictures. It said not to brag
[29:11.040 --> 29:13.440]  but I am fucking killing it. You are killing it bro. I saw your
[29:13.440 --> 29:17.040]  photos. I will testify you are fucking killing it. It says it
[29:17.040 --> 29:20.440]  feels good. I've come so far in four years and a large amount of
[29:20.440 --> 29:24.440]  my personal development has been inspired by your episodes. I am
[29:24.440 --> 29:26.920]  seeing a trend here. A lot of people are telling me lately
[29:27.080 --> 29:30.640]  that they are becoming better growers because of my episodes.
[29:30.640 --> 29:33.120]  I've been doing the show for about six years now. That means
[29:33.120 --> 29:35.320]  people have been listening for four to six years. This guy's
[29:35.320 --> 29:38.120]  been listening for four years, or at least growing for four
[29:38.120 --> 29:41.920]  years and is noticing personal development inspired by the
[29:41.920 --> 29:45.880]  episodes. That means a lot to me. You guys inspire me to get
[29:45.880 --> 29:48.200]  better. I have to be a better grower, a better speaker, a
[29:48.200 --> 29:51.000]  better podcaster, because I'm getting a bigger audience, a
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.920]  better show. I got to stay on top of my shit. I always got to
[29:53.920 --> 29:57.000]  be the sensei. But I'm still learning all the time. So you
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.040]  guys inspire me to have personal development as well. So thank
[30:00.040 --> 30:03.320]  you for that perfect dynamic. It says I prefer to learn more from
[30:03.320 --> 30:06.240]  someone else's mistakes. And that is what you're providing to
[30:06.240 --> 30:10.360]  growers everywhere. Thanks for everything homie from Glenn
[30:10.400 --> 30:16.280]  Geroni. Yes, I am not a ninja. I'm not a wizard. I have made a
[30:16.280 --> 30:19.880]  lot of mistakes. Don't ever get me wrong. I am not perfect. When
[30:19.880 --> 30:22.800]  I talk about all the success I've had, there are a lot of
[30:22.800 --> 30:25.560]  failures that came with that success. But it's how you deal
[30:25.560 --> 30:29.320]  with those failures that make you successful. If you fall off
[30:29.320 --> 30:32.760]  that horse nine times, you get on that horse nine fucking times
[30:32.760 --> 30:35.320]  the 10th time you won't fall off, you're probably gonna win.
[30:35.600 --> 30:39.520]  I've probably fallen down 15 times and gotten up fucking 15
[30:39.520 --> 30:42.560]  times you guys so that is how it goes. Glenn Geroni Thank you

[31:18.360 --> 31:23.480]  do what it is doing now. Today my Instagram live got over 100
[31:23.520 --> 31:25.880]  viewers. That's the first time it's ever done that. If you're
[31:25.880 --> 31:28.720]  not checking out the Instagram, it's I read underscore genetics
[31:28.720 --> 31:31.720]  on Instagram live. Check out the Instagram live shows if you like
[31:31.720 --> 31:34.800]  my podcast, you'll love the Instagram live. It's freestyle.
[31:34.800 --> 31:38.440]  It's free flow and I take dabs. My point is, thank you. You guys
[31:38.440 --> 31:41.560]  are blowing up the podcast. You're blowing up my Patreon. My
[31:41.560 --> 31:44.680]  Instagram is going crazy. My YouTube is going crazy. I
[31:44.680 --> 31:47.920]  appreciate it without you guys. I've said this before. I am some
[31:47.940 --> 31:50.760]  psychopath with too many electronics and too many toys.
[31:50.960 --> 31:54.080]  This would be weird without your guys's exchange on the other end.
[31:54.120 --> 31:58.400]  So thank you. I do appreciate it. Where else are we? I also
[31:58.400 --> 32:01.760]  like it when you follow me on cannabis. Cannabis is a cannabis
[32:01.760 --> 32:04.720]  friendly social media application. You cannot buy
[32:04.720 --> 32:08.200]  trade or sell cannabis on cannabis, but you can post your
[32:08.200 --> 32:11.520]  cannabis related content. You can post your weed pictures, you
[32:11.520 --> 32:14.200]  can post your dab videos, you can post your concentrates. If
[32:14.200 --> 32:16.400]  you've got a problem in your grow, you can post a picture and
[32:16.400 --> 32:18.960]  say what the fuck is wrong with my plants. A bunch of people
[32:18.960 --> 32:22.200]  will chime in and help you out. You won't be hated on you won't
