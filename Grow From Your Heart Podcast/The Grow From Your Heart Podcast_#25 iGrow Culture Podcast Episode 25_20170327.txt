[00:00.060 --> 00:01.060]  Let's do it.
[00:01.060 --> 00:02.060]  Yeah.
[00:02.060 --> 00:03.060]  Yo, check it out.
[00:03.060 --> 00:04.060]  7-10, a big disaster in July.
[00:04.060 --> 00:05.060]  Look out!
[00:05.060 --> 00:06.060]  Bombs are going off.
[00:06.060 --> 00:07.060]  We whip the batter till it's dry.
[00:07.060 --> 00:08.060]  Uh-huh.
[00:08.060 --> 00:09.060]  I love my butter on another matter.
[00:09.060 --> 00:10.060]  Why?
[00:10.060 --> 00:11.060]  Cause the tip the dabber tends to chip the shatter in my eye.
[00:11.060 --> 00:12.060]  Ow!
[00:12.060 --> 00:13.060]  Mics, I'm set to scorch.
[00:13.060 --> 00:14.060]  Forget the dome as well.
[00:14.060 --> 00:15.060]  Cause I'm a vector torch and the microphone's a nail.
[00:15.060 --> 00:16.060]  Yeah.
[00:16.060 --> 00:17.060]  I'm the truth.
[00:17.060 --> 00:18.060]  All you liars go to hell.
[00:18.060 --> 00:19.060]  Every time I grab the mic it's like a giant show and tell.
[00:19.060 --> 00:20.060]  Well, today I brought this.
[00:20.060 --> 00:21.060]  We've been doing this since way back.
[00:21.060 --> 00:22.060]  Way back.
[00:22.060 --> 00:23.060]  I used to get in trouble for this.
[00:23.060 --> 00:24.060]  I used to get in trouble for this.
[00:25.060 --> 00:26.060]  I used to get A's until I blazed them.
[00:26.060 --> 00:27.060]  My grades slacked.
[00:27.060 --> 00:28.060]  Went to college and acknowledged that I hated that route.
[00:28.060 --> 00:29.060]  So I backed out and I doubt I'll ever make it back.
[00:29.060 --> 00:30.060]  I see the way you act.
[00:30.060 --> 00:31.060]  Cut the jealous crap.
[00:31.060 --> 00:32.060]  Something's fishy here.
[00:32.060 --> 00:33.060]  I think I smell a rat.
[00:33.060 --> 00:34.060]  This is our house, but we ain't gotta tell them that.
[00:34.060 --> 00:35.060]  Let's leave them at the front door yelling at the welcome mat.
[00:35.060 --> 00:36.060]  Come on everybody, get another dab pat.
[00:36.060 --> 00:37.060]  Same routine, slightly different from the last track.
[00:37.060 --> 00:38.060]  A million subscribers, a million views.
[00:38.060 --> 00:39.060]  I'm a vector torch and the microphone's a nail.
[00:39.060 --> 00:40.060]  Yeah.
[00:40.060 --> 00:41.060]  I'm the truth.
[00:41.060 --> 00:42.060]  All you liars go to hell.
[00:42.060 --> 00:43.060]  Every time I grab the mic it's like a giant show and tell.
[00:43.060 --> 00:44.060]  Well, today I brought this.
[00:44.060 --> 00:45.060]  We've been doing this since way back.
[00:45.060 --> 00:46.060]  Way back.
[00:55.060 --> 00:57.060]  You don't like my dabbing songs.
[00:57.060 --> 00:58.060]  You can kiss my ass crack.
[00:58.060 --> 00:59.060]  Come on everybody, drop another huge bomb.
[00:59.060 --> 01:00.060]  420 Kane, 710.
[01:00.060 --> 01:01.060]  It's time to move on.
[01:01.060 --> 01:02.060]  Upgrade your tolerance.
[01:02.060 --> 01:07.100]  Yo what's up ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07.100 --> 01:11.460]  Welcome to episode number 25 of the I Grow Culture Podcast.
[01:11.460 --> 01:13.620]  I'm your host Ross DeJeff.
[01:13.620 --> 01:15.740]  Thanks again for joining me for the 25th episode.
[01:15.740 --> 01:17.060]  I'm so excited to be here.
[01:17.060 --> 01:20.660]  Big shout out to Taskrock for letting me play his tracks in the background.
[01:20.660 --> 01:24.180]  You're listening to TASK & LINUS at 710 The Movement.
[01:24.180 --> 01:26.900]  Tonight we have Kevin and Adam over here.
[01:26.900 --> 01:27.900]  What's up guys?
[01:27.900 --> 01:28.900]  It's been a while.
[01:28.900 --> 01:29.900]  What is up?
[01:29.900 --> 01:31.500]  Kevin looks like he's having a seizure while he's trying to dance.
[01:31.500 --> 01:32.980]  It's some funny shit to watch.
[01:32.980 --> 01:35.700]  I looked up from the recording equipment and...
[01:35.700 --> 01:36.700]  I'm white.
[01:36.700 --> 01:37.700]  What can I say?
[01:37.700 --> 01:39.860]  Yeah, I think you're doing the Humpty dance.
[01:39.860 --> 01:41.620]  It might have been what that was.
[01:41.620 --> 01:43.180]  It was getting there.
[01:43.180 --> 01:46.380]  You look like MC Hammer on crack, Humpty.
[01:46.380 --> 01:47.380]  Yeah.
[01:47.380 --> 01:50.620]  I gotta catch my breath from some dabs we took, but we're gonna have a great time.
[01:51.580 --> 01:52.580]  It's the 25th episode.
[01:52.580 --> 01:53.580]  I'm excited.
[01:53.580 --> 01:54.580]  This is cool.
[01:54.580 --> 01:55.580]  So what are you guys doing?
[01:55.580 --> 01:56.580]  How are you guys, man?
[01:56.580 --> 01:57.580]  What's going on?
[01:57.580 --> 01:58.580]  Great.
[01:58.580 --> 01:59.580]  I'm pumped, man.
[01:59.580 --> 02:00.580]  Ready and glad to be here for 25.
[02:00.580 --> 02:01.580]  You just showed up, bro.
[02:01.580 --> 02:02.580]  Thanks for getting here right on time.
[02:02.580 --> 02:03.580]  Running a little late.
[02:03.580 --> 02:05.380]  Things are pretty crazy at the Hut.
[02:05.380 --> 02:06.380]  That's all right.
[02:06.380 --> 02:08.900]  It gave Kevin and I some time to take some dabs and hang out.
[02:08.900 --> 02:09.900]  At the Hut.
[02:09.900 --> 02:10.900]  Did you call it the Hut?
[02:10.900 --> 02:11.900]  Oh, the Hut.
[02:11.900 --> 02:12.900]  Not your house, the Hut.
[02:12.900 --> 02:13.900]  No, no.
[02:13.900 --> 02:14.900]  The actual Hut.
[02:14.900 --> 02:15.900]  Jabba owns it.
[02:15.900 --> 02:16.900]  Jabba owns that Hut.
[02:16.900 --> 02:17.900]  Word.
[02:17.900 --> 02:21.740]  I should mention that we've got the email set up next to us on the Eric Ross 4.0 rig.
[02:21.740 --> 02:24.860]  So say hello to the email, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24.860 --> 02:26.620]  That's the email talking back to you.
[02:26.620 --> 02:28.100]  It'll be doing a lot of work tonight.
[02:28.100 --> 02:29.100]  All right.
[02:29.100 --> 02:30.100]  I'm better.
[02:30.100 --> 02:31.100]  I got a cough.
[02:31.100 --> 02:32.860]  I feel like we're doing good.
[02:32.860 --> 02:33.860]  What happened to the music?
[02:33.860 --> 02:34.860]  Who's responsible for that?
[02:34.860 --> 02:35.860]  I think you are.
[02:35.860 --> 02:36.860]  Here it comes.
[02:36.860 --> 02:37.860]  It's coming again.
[02:37.860 --> 02:38.860]  Watch.
[02:38.860 --> 02:39.860]  It's there.
[02:39.860 --> 02:40.860]  There's the music.
[02:40.860 --> 02:41.860]  There it is.
[02:41.860 --> 02:42.860]  Just roll it.
[02:42.860 --> 02:43.860]  Do it again.
[02:43.860 --> 02:44.860]  Do it again.
[02:44.860 --> 02:45.860]  Yeah.
[02:45.860 --> 02:46.860]  Do it again.
[02:46.860 --> 02:47.860]  No, we'll just do it that one time.
[02:47.860 --> 02:48.860]  All right.
[02:48.860 --> 02:49.860]  So, guys, it's episode 25.
[02:49.860 --> 02:52.180]  I wanted you guys here because Spence and Jesse are hard to get here, or they would
[02:52.180 --> 02:53.180]  have been here too.
[02:53.180 --> 02:55.580]  But of course, at this time of night, they're not coming.
[02:55.580 --> 02:56.580]  So we're the second choice.
[02:56.580 --> 02:57.580]  No, I want all four.
[02:57.580 --> 02:58.580]  I heard that too.
[02:58.580 --> 02:59.580]  It's cool.
[02:59.580 --> 03:00.580]  I heard that too.
[03:00.580 --> 03:01.580]  It's okay.
[03:01.580 --> 03:02.580]  It's all good.
[03:02.580 --> 03:03.580]  It's not.
[03:03.580 --> 03:04.580]  Oh, fuck.
[03:04.580 --> 03:05.580]  I appreciate the invite regardless.
[03:05.580 --> 03:06.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:06.580 --> 03:07.580]  Totally.
[03:07.580 --> 03:08.580]  I love it.
[03:08.580 --> 03:09.580]  Cool.
[03:09.580 --> 03:11.580]  I love that I'm all high, and you guys want to turn that and make me sound like a dick.
[03:11.580 --> 03:12.580]  That's cool.
[03:12.580 --> 03:13.580]  No, I wanted all four of you here.
[03:13.580 --> 03:14.580]  All right.
[03:14.580 --> 03:15.580]  I wanted all four of you guys here.
[03:15.580 --> 03:16.580]  That would have been dope.
[03:17.300 --> 03:18.300]  That would have been loud, but it would have been fun.
[03:18.300 --> 03:19.300]  It would have been a lot of fun.
[03:19.300 --> 03:20.660]  We would have had to get more chairs out, more microphones.
[03:20.660 --> 03:21.860]  It would have been pretty awesome.
[03:21.860 --> 03:22.860]  But imagine that party.
[03:22.860 --> 03:24.580]  Probably one other dab rig.
[03:24.580 --> 03:25.580]  Yeah.
[03:25.580 --> 03:26.580]  At least.
[03:26.580 --> 03:29.100]  But it's like one in the morning, you guys that are listening.
[03:29.100 --> 03:31.580]  It's one in the morning on Friday night.
[03:31.580 --> 03:32.580]  That's my fault.
[03:32.580 --> 03:33.580]  I'm sorry.
[03:33.580 --> 03:34.580]  Well, we all had shit to do.
[03:34.580 --> 03:35.580]  I'm a grower.
[03:35.580 --> 03:36.580]  Kev's got a life.
[03:36.580 --> 03:37.580]  Yeah, you had to work.
[03:37.580 --> 03:38.580]  Ish.
[03:38.580 --> 03:39.580]  Yeah.
[03:39.580 --> 03:40.580]  Ish.
[03:40.580 --> 03:41.580]  Life-ish.
[03:41.580 --> 03:42.580]  All right.
[03:42.580 --> 03:43.580]  I think that's where I got my second choices.
[03:43.580 --> 03:44.580]  You got me feeling bad and shit for that.
[03:44.580 --> 03:45.580]  Man, God.
[03:45.580 --> 03:46.580]  We love you, brother.
[03:46.580 --> 03:47.580]  We're not giving you shit.
[03:47.580 --> 03:49.580]  You're making me cry on the 25th episode.
[03:49.580 --> 03:54.580]  Anyway, so last night, Adam and myself and another friend went to a comedy show at Comedy
[03:54.580 --> 03:55.580]  Works in Denver.
[03:55.580 --> 03:57.540]  We saw a comedian called Todd Johnson.
[03:57.540 --> 03:58.540]  Called Todd Johnson.
[03:58.540 --> 04:00.580]  I sound like an Asian guy when you say it that way.
[04:00.580 --> 04:01.580]  This guy called Todd Johnson.
[04:01.580 --> 04:03.580]  I saw the comedian named Todd Johnson.
[04:03.580 --> 04:06.380]  He was pretty funny, but I thought he was kind of clean for my taste.
[04:06.380 --> 04:08.580]  He was kind of good old boy comedy.
[04:08.580 --> 04:11.980]  You said nasty on the ride there, so I was really expecting dirty.
[04:11.980 --> 04:13.260]  So Comedy Works is hooking me up.
[04:13.260 --> 04:17.740]  I've gone to a lot of Comedy Works shows, and they see my email address on a lot of
[04:17.740 --> 04:18.740]  shit.
[04:18.740 --> 04:21.260]  So they called me, and they're like, we'll give you free tickets to a bunch of shows,
[04:21.260 --> 04:24.460]  or you can get $5 tickets to a bunch of other shows.
[04:24.460 --> 04:27.180]  And they do it just to fill the seats is what they're trying to do.
[04:27.180 --> 04:31.620]  And I see why now that we got there, why that comedy show was $5.
[04:31.620 --> 04:34.260]  But I told them next time, give me somebody dirty.
[04:34.260 --> 04:37.340]  I was like, I want something dirtier, a little filthy.
[04:37.340 --> 04:40.340]  The opening act, there was a host who I always forget his name.
[04:40.340 --> 04:42.700]  It's Ron something, and I feel bad that I forget his name.
[04:43.140 --> 04:47.460]  He's a comedian, well known for doing dabs, dab jokes, weed jokes.
[04:47.460 --> 04:48.460]  He's pretty funny.
[04:48.460 --> 04:49.460]  He's a good host.
[04:49.460 --> 04:50.460]  He's getting better at being a host.
[04:50.460 --> 04:52.980]  Is he like in a comedy group?
[04:52.980 --> 04:54.300]  He used to be, I think.
[04:54.300 --> 04:55.300]  He's a short dude.
[04:55.300 --> 04:59.540]  Sorry to call you short, bro, but I'm 6'5".
[04:59.540 --> 05:02.380]  Everybody's fucking short to me.
[05:02.380 --> 05:03.380]  We'll look him up.
[05:03.380 --> 05:04.380]  We'll Google him when we take a dab break.
[05:04.380 --> 05:05.380]  I'm trying to think.
[05:05.380 --> 05:06.380]  What was his name again?
[05:06.380 --> 05:07.380]  Ron was his first name.
[05:07.380 --> 05:08.380]  I'm pretty sure.
[05:08.380 --> 05:10.060]  He's a real friendly looking, but he's a comedian, man.
[05:10.060 --> 05:11.060]  I can't do anything I say to describe him.
[05:11.060 --> 05:12.060]  He's a real friendly looking dude.
[05:12.060 --> 05:13.060]  He's short.
[05:13.060 --> 05:14.060]  He's got a bit of a gut.
[05:14.060 --> 05:16.540]  I would like to know if he was one of the guys I saw at Phil's one night, because there
[05:16.540 --> 05:23.260]  were two comedians that came down from Denver that were fucking hilarious and did some awesome
[05:23.260 --> 05:24.260]  dab jokes and shit.
[05:24.260 --> 05:25.260]  Could have been this guy.
[05:25.260 --> 05:29.100]  I actually tipped him with some goodies because of the jokes that they made.
[05:29.100 --> 05:30.100]  Some goodies, I like that.
[05:30.100 --> 05:32.100]  They were the only two comedians that did that shit.
[05:32.100 --> 05:34.580]  Well, following up, that guy was the host.
[05:34.580 --> 05:36.540]  Following him was a guy named Deacon Gray, right?
[05:36.540 --> 05:38.340]  Was there a comedian before Deacon Gray?
[05:38.340 --> 05:39.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:39.620 --> 05:40.620]  Deacon...
[05:40.620 --> 05:43.620]  Oh no, because it seemed like the host did a short set.
[05:43.620 --> 05:46.100]  The host did a five minute set.
[05:46.100 --> 05:47.580]  And then Deacon Gray came out.
[05:47.580 --> 05:52.620]  And if you guys don't know Deacon Gray, Deacon Gray is a Denver local as far as I know.
[05:52.620 --> 05:53.620]  He's funny as shit.
[05:53.620 --> 05:57.020]  He's kind of an older dude and he's had time to calm down.
[05:57.020 --> 06:00.700]  He's not a hyper kid and he's got his delivery is flawless.
[06:00.700 --> 06:03.240]  He doesn't look like he's up there performing.
[06:03.240 --> 06:05.780]  He's up there having as much fun as we are.
[06:05.780 --> 06:07.620]  And he did quite a bit of high humor too.
[06:07.620 --> 06:09.100]  And I mean, that's not easy.
[06:09.100 --> 06:12.460]  I mean, it seems easy to write jokes about pot, but it's, you know.
[06:12.460 --> 06:13.460]  Right.
[06:13.460 --> 06:17.060]  And it has to be in Denver now, there's a thing where everybody's a pot comic.
[06:17.060 --> 06:19.060]  So you can't be a pot comic.
[06:19.060 --> 06:20.620]  You have to have that.
[06:20.620 --> 06:23.180]  You can throw in your pot set for when the crowd is there.
[06:23.180 --> 06:26.540]  It wasn't rely on that because it gets old quickly.
[06:26.540 --> 06:27.660]  It wasn't about pot.
[06:27.660 --> 06:30.620]  It was more about the high humor, you know, about being high.
[06:30.620 --> 06:31.620]  Yeah.
[06:31.620 --> 06:35.340]  Then it was about like, I get my weed for cheap.
[06:35.340 --> 06:36.340]  Deacon Gray.
[06:36.340 --> 06:37.340]  I recommend that dude.
[06:38.060 --> 06:39.060]  Go see him.
[06:39.060 --> 06:40.060]  I don't know.
[06:40.060 --> 06:41.060]  He might have a website or something.
[06:41.060 --> 06:42.060]  I didn't do any research on that.
[06:42.060 --> 06:45.180]  Also, a big shout out to Melissa from comedy works.
[06:45.180 --> 06:50.100]  She probably does not have any clue about this podcast, but she made it listen.
[06:50.100 --> 06:51.100]  Yeah.
[06:51.100 --> 06:52.100]  She should listen.
[06:52.100 --> 06:53.460]  I'll tell her next time I talk to her on the phone, I'll be like, you should listen to
[06:53.460 --> 06:54.460]  my show.
[06:54.460 --> 06:55.740]  But she hooked it up.
[06:55.740 --> 06:56.740]  She made it all worth it.
[06:56.740 --> 06:59.020]  I'll be catching Joe Rogan at comedy works next week.
[06:59.020 --> 07:03.740]  And I'll let you guys know how that goes on the next episode.
[07:03.740 --> 07:06.300]  I'm coughing it up over here.
[07:06.300 --> 07:07.580]  We've been taking dabs guys.
[07:07.580 --> 07:09.100]  Excuse my little miniature pauses.
[07:09.100 --> 07:10.860]  That is not me dying at all.
[07:10.860 --> 07:11.860]  I'm also kind of cold.
[07:11.860 --> 07:18.020]  I left the air on until fucking like midnight and they got like 64 degrees in here.
[07:18.020 --> 07:20.420]  It was 60 degrees less anyways.
[07:20.420 --> 07:21.860]  Yeah, it was chilly in here.
[07:21.860 --> 07:26.140]  I've been used to it being like 85 90 and then I walked up here and it was 60 64 and
[07:26.140 --> 07:27.140]  I was shivering.
[07:27.140 --> 07:28.140]  It was kind of weird.
[07:28.140 --> 07:29.900]  Anyway, random talk on the show guys.
[07:29.900 --> 07:30.900]  Sorry.
[07:30.900 --> 07:35.500]  So before we get too far, this is a celebration show, but we have something really awesome
[07:35.700 --> 07:36.700]  to add to this celebration.
[07:36.700 --> 07:42.140]  I'm excited to announce that Mark Emery is home in Canada with his wife Jodi.
[07:42.140 --> 07:43.140]  Congratulations.
[07:43.140 --> 07:45.180]  That is that is great.
[07:45.180 --> 07:46.180]  Yeah.
[07:46.180 --> 07:49.700]  If you guys follow the show, you know that Mark Emery was arrested and held in an American
[07:49.700 --> 07:53.620]  federal prison for distributing cannabis seeds across the world.
[07:53.620 --> 07:57.620]  Most listeners of the show would agree that Mark was in prison for complete bullshit.
[07:57.620 --> 08:00.500]  So I think it's great to know that he's back home with his family where he belongs.
[08:00.500 --> 08:01.900]  He's cuddled up with his wife.
[08:01.900 --> 08:05.340]  I saw a picture of him smoking a joint with some people.
[08:06.180 --> 08:07.180]  I saw a picture of him hugging up on his wife.
[08:07.180 --> 08:09.020]  That's what a man should be doing.
[08:09.020 --> 08:11.100]  You shouldn't be locked up.
[08:11.100 --> 08:12.260]  And he's right back on the fight.
[08:12.260 --> 08:14.860]  I don't know if you've watched any video.
[08:14.860 --> 08:18.700]  He's right up there and I never really noticed that he spoke with a wisp.
[08:18.700 --> 08:23.340]  Maybe he has a retainer or something, but it really was pronounced when he like when
[08:23.340 --> 08:27.220]  he very first stepped back into Canada and got in front of the microphone.
[08:27.220 --> 08:28.220]  I don't remember that.
[08:28.220 --> 08:29.580]  I can I can link you to the video.
[08:29.580 --> 08:31.780]  I always remember him going on and on for days.
[08:31.780 --> 08:32.780]  Me too.
[08:32.780 --> 08:36.740]  It's something that I never really noticed, but he's right back on it and his wife's running
[08:36.740 --> 08:45.340]  for liberal, liberal, some kind of liberal office up there for their stuff.
[08:45.340 --> 08:46.340]  I believe you like the power.
[08:46.340 --> 08:47.340]  Yeah, good, good.
[08:47.340 --> 08:48.340]  It's good to see him back on it.
[08:48.340 --> 08:49.340]  That was quick.
[08:49.340 --> 08:50.780]  So big love and much respect to Mark and Jody Emery.
[08:50.780 --> 08:52.900]  I did a little bit of checking it out.
[08:52.900 --> 08:57.020]  Mark was taken into federal prison on September 10th, 2010.
[08:57.020 --> 09:00.380]  He was released July 9th, 2014.
[09:00.380 --> 09:01.380]  I used Siri.
[09:01.380 --> 09:04.060]  I was going to say I used a calculator.
[09:04.060 --> 09:06.220]  I just asked Siri how many days was that?
[09:06.220 --> 09:11.180]  It's one thousand three hundred and ninety eight days in federal prison, plus the time
[09:11.180 --> 09:15.520]  he was locked up while awaiting trial, the time during the trial and a couple of weeks
[09:15.520 --> 09:19.580]  in limbo after he was released from federal prison.
[09:19.580 --> 09:22.820]  One thousand three hundred and ninety eight days.
[09:22.820 --> 09:26.060]  Adam, you look speechless.
[09:26.060 --> 09:29.580]  Are you familiar with that sort of time period?
[09:29.780 --> 09:30.780]  It's a long, long time.
[09:30.780 --> 09:32.300]  That's a long time, dude.
[09:32.300 --> 09:38.500]  It's I am going to sound retarded here, but I did three and then fifty four and I felt
[09:38.500 --> 09:40.300]  like it was fucking hell.
[09:40.300 --> 09:41.940]  Three days and fifty four days.
[09:41.940 --> 09:44.140]  So you're a little tiny dude.
[09:44.140 --> 09:47.940]  So you're not like that's some fucking street courage and some bad assness.
[09:47.940 --> 09:48.940]  Yeah.
[09:48.940 --> 09:49.940]  So good job, man.
[09:49.940 --> 09:50.940]  Yeah.
[09:50.940 --> 09:53.980]  I mean, that's kind of what I was going to ask is now that he's he was the prince of
[09:53.980 --> 09:54.980]  pop before he came in.
[09:54.980 --> 09:55.980]  Now, yeah.
[09:55.980 --> 09:57.980]  Does he knock Ari off his king throne?
[09:58.380 --> 09:59.380]  You ain't got a lick.
[09:59.380 --> 10:00.380]  You know what I'm saying?
[10:00.380 --> 10:01.380]  I'm not touching that.
[10:01.380 --> 10:04.380]  OK, that's close to four years, though, in federal prison.
[10:04.380 --> 10:07.380]  That's forty six months, two hundred weeks.
[10:07.380 --> 10:10.380]  So imagine your life being disrupted for two hundred weeks.
[10:10.380 --> 10:12.380]  You'd be a totally different time.
[10:12.380 --> 10:16.380]  Well, you know, he said he learned like the bass guitar and he did a lot of read.
[10:16.380 --> 10:17.380]  That's awesome, man.
[10:17.380 --> 10:18.380]  One of the bass in prison.
[10:18.380 --> 10:19.380]  That's cool.
[10:19.380 --> 10:21.380]  Mine was in county jail, not federal prison.
[10:21.380 --> 10:22.380]  Right.
[10:22.380 --> 10:25.380]  That's a whole nother level even like that's amazing.
[10:25.380 --> 10:27.380]  And I'm glad he's free.
[10:27.780 --> 10:28.780]  Yeah, I can.
[10:28.780 --> 10:29.780]  Awesome.
[10:29.780 --> 10:33.780]  Well, he was locked up on that's in our opinion, bullshit charges, bullshit charges.
[10:33.780 --> 10:37.780]  It makes awesome, makes every seed breeder pot grower.
[10:37.780 --> 10:40.780]  It makes us all a little bit kind of and not only that, but he was worried about ourselves
[10:40.780 --> 10:42.780]  before the rules have changed.
[10:42.780 --> 10:46.780]  And now that they've changed, you know, I can just imagine the culture shock.
[10:46.780 --> 10:50.780]  I mean, from where he was, Mark Emmer, where he could probably puff on the street any time
[10:50.780 --> 10:51.780]  he wanted to.
[10:51.780 --> 10:54.780]  But now in Canada, they don't really seem to care from what people have told me.
[10:54.780 --> 10:56.780]  They're like, come here and smoke weed.
[10:57.180 --> 10:58.180]  They don't really.
[10:58.180 --> 10:59.180]  They don't think about problems to fry.
[10:59.180 --> 11:00.180]  Yeah, they don't talk about it like we do.
[11:00.180 --> 11:03.180]  They don't get all hyped about it, but they also don't give a shit about it.
[11:03.180 --> 11:04.180]  All right.
[11:04.180 --> 11:06.180]  So big shout out to Mark Emmer.
[11:06.180 --> 11:09.180]  If you guys are longtime listeners, you know that we actually did.
[11:09.180 --> 11:13.180]  We used to do a portion of the show called Give Thanks, which I will do again in the
[11:13.180 --> 11:14.180]  future.
[11:14.180 --> 11:15.180]  But we've been packing the show.
[11:15.180 --> 11:16.180]  It's been like an hour and 15 minutes sometimes.
[11:16.180 --> 11:19.180]  And I don't feel like we need to stretch it out with another give thanks portion once
[11:19.180 --> 11:20.180]  we're that long.
[11:20.180 --> 11:21.180]  So I just wrap it up.
[11:21.180 --> 11:24.180]  So, yeah, welcome home, Mark Emmer.
[11:24.180 --> 11:26.180]  Much love to Jody Emmer for being strong and keeping herself healthy.
[11:26.580 --> 11:29.580]  Keeping herself active in the movement while we were down one soldier.
[11:29.580 --> 11:30.580]  All right.
[11:30.580 --> 11:31.580]  Where'd the music go?
[11:31.580 --> 11:32.580]  I don't know.
[11:32.580 --> 11:33.580]  It's right there.
[11:33.580 --> 11:34.580]  Just real quiet.
[11:34.580 --> 11:35.580]  There it is.
[11:35.580 --> 11:36.580]  Task Rock.
[11:36.580 --> 11:37.580]  What's up, Task?
[11:37.580 --> 11:42.580]  So I need to take one second to make an important make an.
[11:42.580 --> 11:44.580]  I'm fucking high and stuttering.
[11:44.580 --> 11:45.580]  Let's try that in English.
[11:45.580 --> 11:46.580]  In English this time.
[11:46.580 --> 11:49.580]  I need to make an important announcement.
[11:49.580 --> 11:50.580]  Look, I did it.
[11:50.580 --> 11:54.580]  All the contests we have started on the show will be ending soon.
[11:54.980 --> 11:59.980]  I left a few contests open ended and I've been waiting for answers to a few like questions
[11:59.980 --> 12:00.980]  and stuff like that.
[12:00.980 --> 12:03.980]  I think those episodes have gotten old and the giveaways have just faded away.
[12:03.980 --> 12:05.980]  So I want to reuse the prizes.
[12:05.980 --> 12:11.980]  So I'll end all the contests that are happening now on the podcast, August 17th at 11, 1559
[12:11.980 --> 12:12.980]  p.m.
[12:12.980 --> 12:13.980]  Mountain Time.
[12:13.980 --> 12:18.980]  The Jenny Kush prizes and any other unused prizes will be used for future contests and
[12:18.980 --> 12:19.980]  giveaways.
[12:19.980 --> 12:20.980]  So look forward to that.
[12:21.380 --> 12:25.380]  I just wanted to make an official ending date on those contests so that when I do reuse
[12:25.380 --> 12:30.380]  those prizes, nobody can get mad if they try to go win the old contests.
[12:30.380 --> 12:31.380]  There it is.
[12:31.380 --> 12:32.380]  Official shit.
[12:32.380 --> 12:33.380]  All right.
[12:35.380 --> 12:38.380]  So I do have a Jenny Kush pin and a couple other pins and things that I tried to use
[12:38.380 --> 12:39.380]  in contests before.
[12:39.380 --> 12:42.380]  There'll be a Jenny Kush pin available pretty soon.
[12:42.380 --> 12:43.380]  I need to check the little box.
[12:43.380 --> 12:44.380]  I've got some prizes set aside.
[12:44.380 --> 12:45.380]  We're going to put them back in.
[12:45.380 --> 12:46.380]  Pins are cool, giveaways.
[12:46.380 --> 12:47.380]  Giveaways?
[12:47.380 --> 12:48.380]  Giveaways.
[12:48.380 --> 12:49.380]  You're as high as me, dude.
[12:49.380 --> 12:50.380]  No, I'm not.
[12:50.780 --> 12:51.780]  Honestly, that's the problem.
[12:51.780 --> 12:53.780]  Let's get you a couple dabs if you're saying you're not as high as me.
[12:53.780 --> 12:54.780]  No, you're good.
[12:54.780 --> 12:55.780]  No, it's cool, man.
[12:55.780 --> 12:56.780]  You're on a podcast where we need to...
[12:56.780 --> 12:57.780]  I don't need to speak well.
[12:57.780 --> 12:59.780]  You know what I'm saying?
[12:59.780 --> 13:01.780]  Well, it's a podcast.
[13:01.780 --> 13:02.780]  What are you going to do?
[13:02.780 --> 13:03.780]  You don't look good.
[13:03.780 --> 13:05.780]  Oh, well, yeah, sorry.
[13:05.780 --> 13:09.780]  For all you ladies and gentlemen that were hoping to see me, he's told you where to find
[13:09.780 --> 13:11.780]  me and look at my ugly mug before.
[13:11.780 --> 13:12.780]  So that's the...
[13:12.780 --> 13:13.780]  Go ahead and dab that.
[13:13.780 --> 13:14.780]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[13:14.780 --> 13:15.780]  That's some TerpX right there.
[13:15.780 --> 13:18.780]  Shout out to the TerpX boys, Jordan and Jordan.
[13:19.180 --> 13:21.180]  Also, big shout out to the Grammy Gatsby.
[13:22.180 --> 13:23.180]  Keep running, Hunt.
[13:23.180 --> 13:26.180]  I want to see you do six miles every morning without fucking getting winded.
[13:26.180 --> 13:27.180]  That's what I want.
[13:28.180 --> 13:31.180]  My buddy Hunt has quit eating meat, eats fish still.
[13:31.180 --> 13:32.180]  I saw that.
[13:32.180 --> 13:33.180]  And he's cut out...
[13:33.180 --> 13:36.180]  He's addicted to soda and he's cut out 23, bro.
[13:36.180 --> 13:38.180]  The Dr. Pepper, he's cut it out of his life.
[13:38.180 --> 13:39.180]  So give him some strength for that.
[13:39.180 --> 13:40.180]  Word.
[13:40.180 --> 13:41.180]  Big shout out.
[13:41.180 --> 13:43.180]  I quit Mountain Dew just for exercising.
[13:44.180 --> 13:45.180]  Yeah, I cut out Mountain Dew.
[13:45.180 --> 13:48.180]  I used to be strongly addicted to Mountain Dew and I cut that out of my diet.
[13:48.580 --> 13:50.580]  And my body feels better.
[13:50.580 --> 13:51.580]  That was tasty.
[13:51.580 --> 13:52.580]  Do you want another one?
[13:52.580 --> 13:53.580]  No, no, I'm good for a second, but that was tasty.
[13:53.580 --> 13:54.580]  Cool, I'm going to take this one right here.
[13:54.580 --> 13:55.580]  You want a dab here?
[13:55.580 --> 13:56.580]  Go for it.
[13:56.580 --> 13:57.580]  Shout out to TerpX, for real.
[13:57.580 --> 13:58.580]  Go for it.
[13:58.580 --> 13:59.580]  If you're handing them out.
[13:59.580 --> 14:00.580]  We're handing out dabs.
[14:00.580 --> 14:01.580]  That's what we do.
[14:01.580 --> 14:02.580]  You know how we do it here on the iGrowCulture podcast.
[14:02.580 --> 14:03.580]  I'm a smoker and that was smooth.
[14:04.580 --> 14:07.580]  Yeah, I think you guys are crazy that smoke cigarettes and still take...
[14:07.580 --> 14:09.580]  Are able to take dabs and shit.
[14:09.580 --> 14:10.580]  Man.
[14:10.580 --> 14:11.580]  I'm trying, brother.
[14:11.580 --> 14:12.580]  I'm trying to get rid of it.
[14:12.580 --> 14:13.580]  Trust me.
[14:13.580 --> 14:14.580]  It's killing me.
[14:14.580 --> 14:16.580]  Well, you got a nice outdoor harvest coming up.
[14:16.980 --> 14:18.980]  So you should just roll a bunch of...
[14:18.980 --> 14:22.980]  You should get some tobacco, like some fucking pouch tobacco.
[14:22.980 --> 14:23.980]  I can't mix it.
[14:23.980 --> 14:24.980]  Well, then just roll some joints.
[14:24.980 --> 14:25.980]  Well, then you'll get your nicotine fit that way.
[14:25.980 --> 14:27.980]  And then just slowly take the nicotine out.
[14:27.980 --> 14:28.980]  I can...
[14:28.980 --> 14:30.980]  Like I said, I've done the jail thing.
[14:30.980 --> 14:31.980]  I can just quit.
[14:31.980 --> 14:32.980]  Okay.
[14:32.980 --> 14:35.980]  That's my problem is her smoking next to me.
[14:35.980 --> 14:36.980]  You know, we both have to quit.
[14:36.980 --> 14:37.980]  Yeah.
[14:37.980 --> 14:39.980]  And she's not that strong willed.
[14:39.980 --> 14:41.980]  So if she doesn't want to quit, then she won't quit.
[14:41.980 --> 14:42.980]  She doesn't want to.
[14:42.980 --> 14:43.980]  So I'm trying to...
[14:44.380 --> 14:47.380]  I've told her, get a pen and just smoke wax.
[14:47.380 --> 14:48.380]  You know, like you don't...
[14:48.380 --> 14:49.380]  You don't...
[14:49.380 --> 14:50.380]  Exactly.
[14:50.380 --> 14:51.380]  Exactly.
[14:51.380 --> 14:53.380]  He's got a little pen, pulls it out of nowhere.
[14:53.380 --> 14:54.380]  What is that?
[14:54.380 --> 14:55.380]  What's the...
[14:55.380 --> 14:57.380]  You want to say what kind of brand it is?
[14:57.380 --> 14:59.380]  Or I don't know if you want to shout it out.
[14:59.380 --> 15:01.380]  Yeah, well, they gave him that product to test out.
[15:01.380 --> 15:03.380]  And he doesn't really have a platform to give a review.
[15:03.380 --> 15:05.380]  You're tied up in the headphone cable.
[15:05.380 --> 15:07.380]  So you're going to be stuck for life now.
[15:07.380 --> 15:09.380]  But go ahead and tell him the name of the thing.
[15:09.380 --> 15:11.380]  And then I hit it once.
[15:11.380 --> 15:12.380]  I'll tell you my opinion.
[15:12.380 --> 15:13.380]  It's a Neos.
[15:13.780 --> 15:15.780]  I'll shut up so you can talk.
[15:15.780 --> 15:17.780]  The company is Neos.
[15:17.780 --> 15:25.780]  In my opinion, it's an easier draw and better tasting and more effective than some of the other companies.
[15:25.780 --> 15:26.780]  It's good.
[15:26.780 --> 15:29.780]  That's an interesting piece.
[15:29.780 --> 15:34.780]  They gave us some samples to try out to see if, you know, we wanted to carry their stuff.
[15:34.780 --> 15:35.780]  They're a fairly new company.
[15:35.780 --> 15:36.780]  Okay.
[15:36.780 --> 15:38.780]  So they're just trying to get their name out there pretty much.
[15:38.780 --> 15:39.780]  A lot of that's going down right now.
[15:40.180 --> 15:45.180]  The battery is a little bit bigger than some of the other companies that are a similar style.
[15:45.180 --> 15:50.180]  They have strain specific cartridges.
[15:50.180 --> 15:51.180]  It's CO2 oil.
[15:51.180 --> 15:52.180]  I don't know if you mentioned that yet.
[15:52.180 --> 15:53.180]  Yeah, CO2 oil.
[15:53.180 --> 15:54.180]  Yeah.
[15:54.180 --> 15:58.180]  It's a good product.
[15:58.180 --> 16:01.180]  It is not pro level.
[16:01.180 --> 16:03.180]  It's not dab kid dabs.
[16:03.180 --> 16:09.180]  But if you're looking for a vape pen like this, it's really attractive.
[16:09.580 --> 16:12.580]  Okay, so you just replaced the cartridge on the end.
[16:12.580 --> 16:13.580]  Okay, I see it now.
[16:13.580 --> 16:14.580]  Cool.
[16:14.580 --> 16:15.580]  I was looking for the unscrewy part, but you had your finger right there.
[16:15.580 --> 16:18.580]  There's a USB that attaches to the other end.
[16:18.580 --> 16:19.580]  Cool.
[16:19.580 --> 16:20.580]  And the very end of it is a stylus.
[16:20.580 --> 16:21.580]  What does that cost?
[16:21.580 --> 16:24.580]  If I were a rec patient, what would that cost me?
[16:24.580 --> 16:27.580]  We haven't started carrying them yet, so I'm not sure.
[16:27.580 --> 16:31.580]  But similar companies with smaller batteries, like I said, that aren't as great.
[16:31.580 --> 16:35.580]  A starter package is about $58 and some change.
[16:35.980 --> 16:41.980]  For a small cartridge, just a 150 milligram cartridge and a battery.
[16:41.980 --> 16:42.980]  You don't have to replace the battery.
[16:42.980 --> 16:43.980]  You can recharge it.
[16:43.980 --> 16:47.980]  So you just have to come get cartridges, and they make them in three different sizes.
[16:47.980 --> 16:53.980]  But these new ones that we're testing out, we're probably going to start carrying those.
[16:53.980 --> 16:55.980]  And I'm not sure what the price will be on those.
[16:55.980 --> 16:57.980]  It'll be similar, definitely.
[16:57.980 --> 16:59.980]  But it's a cool little piece.
[16:59.980 --> 17:01.980]  I noticed a different high.
[17:01.980 --> 17:02.980]  I noticed a different high from it.
[17:02.980 --> 17:04.980]  We've been dabbing for a while, and I just took another rip off that.
[17:05.380 --> 17:06.380]  And my high changed.
[17:06.380 --> 17:08.380]  It got me a little different.
[17:08.380 --> 17:09.380]  It's a cool product.
[17:09.380 --> 17:12.380]  It's lemon diesel, this particular cartridge.
[17:12.380 --> 17:14.380]  I'm going to take a dab of some Turpex, of course.
[17:14.380 --> 17:17.380]  I might have friends that are Turpex.
[17:17.380 --> 17:19.380]  Something may have hooked me up with some hash there.
[17:19.380 --> 17:20.380]  Someone might have.
[17:20.380 --> 17:21.380]  Turpex is badass.
[17:21.380 --> 17:24.380]  Yeah, Jordan, Jordan, Grammy Gatsby.
[17:24.380 --> 17:27.380]  There are more of the guys, but those are the guys I kick with mostly.
[17:27.380 --> 17:28.380]  I'm going to take this dab.
[17:28.380 --> 17:29.380]  Somebody talk for me for a couple seconds.
[17:29.380 --> 17:33.380]  But no, it's definitely a very attractive case and all that stuff.
[17:33.780 --> 17:34.780]  That's what I'm talking about.
[17:34.780 --> 17:39.780]  Why not get something like that and fill it full of wax that she'll hit maybe.
[17:39.780 --> 17:42.780]  She probably won't clear the damn thing in a week.
[17:44.780 --> 17:45.780]  That would last your wife a week?
[17:45.780 --> 17:47.780]  Oh, that would last a while, dude.
[17:47.780 --> 17:48.780]  I don't know.
[17:48.780 --> 17:50.780]  Those cartridges will last a bit.
[17:50.780 --> 17:52.780]  I can't say if it will or not.
[17:52.780 --> 17:55.780]  But it's very, it's a smooth pull.
[17:55.780 --> 17:56.780]  You don't have to push a button.
[17:56.780 --> 17:57.780]  It's simple.
[17:57.780 --> 18:00.780]  Like I said, you wear it with a black shirt.
[18:00.780 --> 18:01.780]  I didn't even see it.
[18:02.180 --> 18:03.180]  You know, like.
[18:05.180 --> 18:06.180]  All right.
[18:06.180 --> 18:08.180]  That was enough of a free shout out.
[18:10.180 --> 18:13.180]  I got a message on Facebook from a listener named Fred.
[18:13.180 --> 18:18.180]  And ironically, he was asking me to talk about acquiring seeds.
[18:18.180 --> 18:22.180]  It's really great because this email came today while I was preparing for the show.
[18:24.180 --> 18:25.180]  Sorry, excuse my cough, guys.
[18:25.180 --> 18:26.180]  That's from dabs.
[18:26.180 --> 18:28.180]  That's from big dabs.
[18:28.580 --> 18:31.580]  So, I want to talk about acquiring seeds.
[18:31.580 --> 18:35.580]  But before I do that, let me give a little bit of a legal disclaimer.
[18:35.580 --> 18:38.580]  Because we don't want to be the next Mark Emory.
[18:38.580 --> 18:42.580]  It may be illegal to acquire cannabis seeds in your location.
[18:42.580 --> 18:44.580]  It is your responsibility to.
[18:45.580 --> 18:46.580]  Awesome.
[18:47.580 --> 18:48.580]  Let's start that again.
[18:48.580 --> 18:51.580]  I'm not even going to try to edit any of that.
[18:51.580 --> 18:55.580]  It is your responsibility to know the laws in your location.
[18:55.980 --> 19:00.980]  Any company online that will send you seeds is only sending them to you for souvenir purposes.
[19:00.980 --> 19:06.980]  Germinating cannabis seeds is illegal in most places.
[19:06.980 --> 19:08.980]  I'm not here to help you break the law.
[19:08.980 --> 19:12.980]  If you decide to buy and or germinate cannabis seeds, I cannot be responsible for you.
[19:14.980 --> 19:16.980]  I live in Colorado where cannabis is legalized.
[19:16.980 --> 19:21.980]  So, most of my advice is for Colorado, California, Oregon, Washington, or Michigan residents.
[19:22.380 --> 19:25.380]  Be careful and don't get your ass into trouble.
[19:25.380 --> 19:27.380]  Because I'm not a lawyer and I'm not responsible.
[19:27.380 --> 19:31.380]  I'm simply the host of a badass podcast.
[19:31.380 --> 19:33.380]  That's a cool fucking disclaimer, right?
[19:33.380 --> 19:34.380]  Absolutely.
[19:34.380 --> 19:36.380]  I just had to do that because I don't.
[19:36.380 --> 19:40.380]  Guys, if you're ordering seeds, you must be 18 or 21.
[19:40.380 --> 19:42.380]  And you got to be responsible.
[19:42.380 --> 19:44.380]  You have to be smart.
[19:45.380 --> 19:47.380]  Know the rules where you are.
[19:48.380 --> 19:49.380]  In your location.
[19:49.380 --> 19:50.380]  I think they might have used.
[19:50.380 --> 19:51.380]  That's not good.
[19:51.780 --> 19:52.780]  Know the rules in your location.
[19:52.780 --> 19:54.780]  I've used poor grammar, but still.
[19:54.780 --> 19:55.780]  Do that shit.
[19:55.780 --> 20:01.780]  So, now with all that being said, here's what I can tell you about acquiring yourself some seeds.
[20:01.780 --> 20:02.780]  Yourself.
[20:02.780 --> 20:03.780]  Acquiring some seeds.
[20:04.780 --> 20:06.780]  I like quality seeds from reputable breeders.
[20:08.780 --> 20:10.780]  You guys want to rant on breeders for a minute?
[20:10.780 --> 20:11.780]  Who are some of your favorites?
[20:11.780 --> 20:12.780]  I know who you're going to say.
[20:12.780 --> 20:13.780]  Go for it.
[20:13.780 --> 20:14.780]  Say whoever you want.
[20:14.780 --> 20:15.780]  I mean, I've only heard of a few.
[20:15.780 --> 20:16.780]  You know what I'm saying?
[20:16.780 --> 20:18.780]  TGA's definitely got the respect.
[20:18.780 --> 20:19.780]  TGA's sub 4 seeds.
[20:19.780 --> 20:20.780]  Rare Dankness.
[20:21.180 --> 20:22.180]  Rare Dankness is definitely great.
[20:22.180 --> 20:23.180]  I respect both of those guys.
[20:23.180 --> 20:25.180]  And of course, you know, I'm a geneticist.
[20:25.180 --> 20:26.180]  They'll be mentioned in here.
[20:26.180 --> 20:27.180]  That's me, of course.
[20:27.180 --> 20:28.180]  So, you don't have to.
[20:28.180 --> 20:29.180]  Whatever.
[20:29.180 --> 20:30.180]  Alright, whatever.
[20:30.180 --> 20:31.180]  You're already here getting dabs.
[20:31.180 --> 20:32.180]  Don't worry about that.
[20:32.180 --> 20:33.180]  Okay, sure.
[20:33.180 --> 20:34.180]  I was just going to put it out there.
[20:34.180 --> 20:35.180]  Kelly Connection.
[20:35.180 --> 20:36.180]  Who are you thinking?
[20:36.180 --> 20:37.180]  I'm honestly a fan.
[20:37.180 --> 20:38.180]  MTG seeds.
[20:38.180 --> 20:41.180]  I'm honestly a fan of a lot of the new seed breeders coming out.
[20:41.180 --> 20:42.180]  The new guys?
[20:42.180 --> 20:50.180]  Not to take anything away from some of the old guys who have really paved the way and helped a lot of the new seed breeders get good genetic information.
[20:50.580 --> 20:52.580]  Get good genetics to breed with.
[20:52.580 --> 20:55.580]  So, you can't take anything away from those guys.
[20:55.580 --> 21:01.580]  But, I mean, some of the IRI Genetics, La Plata Labs, Gage Green Genetics.
[21:01.580 --> 21:03.580]  Like, they're all doing some really awesome stuff.
[21:03.580 --> 21:07.580]  And they're thinking about what they're crossing and what they're trying to get out of their crosses.
[21:07.580 --> 21:10.580]  And not just finding a good phenotype.
[21:10.580 --> 21:15.580]  They're actually looking for flavor profiles and cannabinoid profiles.
[21:15.580 --> 21:18.580]  And they're getting what they want out of it.
[21:18.980 --> 21:22.980]  And a lot of that has to do with the way they do things.
[21:22.980 --> 21:28.980]  A lot of the new seed breeders are really community friendly and dispersing a lot of seeds to a lot of people.
[21:28.980 --> 21:35.980]  And allowing them to perform their methods of growing and find different types of plants.
[21:35.980 --> 21:44.980]  There's an occasional secret meeting at a place in Denver where a few of us are chosen to meet at this mansion.
[21:44.980 --> 21:45.980]  Shout out to the King of Quality.
[21:45.980 --> 21:46.980]  Mile High Seeds?
[21:47.380 --> 21:48.380]  Yeah.
[21:48.380 --> 21:49.380]  Mile High is there.
[21:49.380 --> 21:50.380]  La Plata Labs is there.
[21:50.380 --> 21:51.380]  Sin City goes.
[21:51.380 --> 21:53.380]  Alpha Chronic shows up.
[21:53.380 --> 21:54.380]  A bunch of us breeders.
[21:54.380 --> 21:55.380]  IRI Genetics goes.
[21:55.380 --> 21:58.380]  And we all take packages of our newest shit or whatever.
[21:58.380 --> 21:59.380]  Our secret weapon.
[21:59.380 --> 22:00.380]  And we trade.
[22:00.380 --> 22:01.380]  Yeah.
[22:01.380 --> 22:06.380]  And, like, Mile High has given me his Apollo Times Brothers Hayes.
[22:06.380 --> 22:08.380]  And I give him my Grateful Dog.
[22:08.380 --> 22:11.380]  You know, like, just trade packs of seeds around the table.
[22:11.380 --> 22:15.380]  And we all, yeah, we try to keep it together with each other instead of trying to compete.
[22:15.780 --> 22:19.780]  We're trying to be like, well, here, bro, here's some face-off OG for some heart of gold.
[22:19.780 --> 22:20.780]  You know, like.
[22:20.780 --> 22:21.780]  Barter.
[22:21.780 --> 22:22.780]  Trade.
[22:22.780 --> 22:24.780]  Then you don't need a bank account.
[22:24.780 --> 22:25.780]  That's right.
[22:25.780 --> 22:26.780]  That's right.
[22:26.780 --> 22:28.780]  So that's a few of our favorite breeders.
[22:28.780 --> 22:30.780]  Buy some seeds from reputable breeders.
[22:30.780 --> 22:31.780]  I'm a breeder.
[22:31.780 --> 22:33.780]  I am IRI Genetics.
[22:33.780 --> 22:39.780]  I would say, since it's hard to get IRI Genetics seeds, Gage Green is one of my favorites.
[22:39.780 --> 22:41.780]  I use Gage Green for breeding stuff.
[22:42.180 --> 22:47.180]  If you want to get into a breeding stuff and you want a reliable male, I can't believe I'm fucking telling the world this,
[22:47.180 --> 22:50.180]  but Gage Green is a good place to find a nice, reliable male.
[22:50.180 --> 22:52.180]  That's true shit right there.
[22:52.180 --> 22:54.180]  That's how friendly I am.
[22:54.180 --> 22:58.180]  But be careful with your breeding because you can still fuck up even with that good male.
[22:58.180 --> 22:59.180]  It's how much I like you guys.
[22:59.180 --> 23:00.180]  You listen to my show.
[23:00.180 --> 23:01.180]  It's awesome.
[23:01.180 --> 23:03.180]  So bag seeds are fun, but they're not as reliable.
[23:03.180 --> 23:07.180]  Bag seeds are seeds that you find in weed, of course, right?
[23:07.180 --> 23:10.180]  They're not as reliable as something you'd find.
[23:10.580 --> 23:14.580]  I'm going to give you something with a specific Paris bred for certain traits like Kevin was saying earlier.
[23:14.580 --> 23:16.580]  So it's kind of cool that he touched on that.
[23:16.580 --> 23:18.580]  Your first option is bag seed.
[23:18.580 --> 23:22.580]  That's shit that you, of course, found in that cush that you bought from that guy in the park and it had a seed in it.
[23:22.580 --> 23:23.580]  Grow that out.
[23:23.580 --> 23:24.580]  See what happens.
[23:24.580 --> 23:29.580]  But keep a close eye on any bag seed because it could be a male or it could be a hermaphrodite.
[23:29.580 --> 23:30.580]  Yep.
[23:30.580 --> 23:31.580]  Yep.
[23:31.580 --> 23:33.580]  Adam's got a yard full of herms.
[23:33.580 --> 23:34.580]  Mm-hmm.
[23:34.580 --> 23:35.580]  Mm-hmm.
[23:35.580 --> 23:36.580]  Mm-hmm.
[23:36.580 --> 23:37.580]  Mm-hmm.
[23:37.980 --> 23:39.980]  Get seeds at a dispensary or a co-op.
[23:39.980 --> 23:48.980]  Many of the shops in California, Colorado, Washington, and Michigan have seeds from reputable breeders available on the shelves in the dispensaries.
[23:48.980 --> 23:55.980]  Almost everywhere in the Pacific Northwest has fucking TGA sub cool seeds all over the place.
[23:55.980 --> 23:59.980]  Most of the shops in Colorado, you can pick up yourself some rare dankness.
[24:00.380 --> 24:11.380]  Michigan's got, oddly enough, they've got Gage Green Genetics because our friend Yankee trolls up and down the East Coast there and takes care of them with the Gage Green.
[24:11.380 --> 24:13.380]  He's a Gage Green rep and he's awesome.
[24:13.380 --> 24:14.380]  They're taken care of.
[24:14.380 --> 24:16.380]  There are seeds on shops and shelves.
[24:16.380 --> 24:17.380]  I was reading.
[24:17.380 --> 24:18.380]  I forgot.
[24:18.380 --> 24:19.380]  There you go.
[24:19.380 --> 24:27.380]  You can also pick up seeds at cannabis events like the Cannabis Cup and Hemfest or whatever else is happening this month because there seems to be an event every damn month now.
[24:27.380 --> 24:28.380]  The breeders go.
[24:28.380 --> 24:29.380]  They set up a tent.
[24:29.780 --> 24:30.780]  Do a little bit of research online.
[24:30.780 --> 24:31.780]  Look what you're...
[24:31.780 --> 24:32.780]  Find out what you're looking for.
[24:32.780 --> 24:34.780]  Find out what you should be paying.
[24:34.780 --> 24:42.780]  Expect to pay about a hundred bucks for a ten-pack of seeds, honestly, between 60 and 120, but about a hundred bucks for a ten-pack of seeds.
[24:42.780 --> 24:49.780]  So, before you go to the events, go and find out what you want and then go there and see if you can find those breeders and you'll have a little shopping done.
[24:49.780 --> 24:51.780]  It'll be a little easier for you.
[24:52.180 --> 25:00.180]  But those are only viable options if you live in or if you can travel to a legal state like Colorado or to Hemfest, which is happening right now.
[25:00.180 --> 25:02.180]  It'll be over by the time you hear this.
[25:02.180 --> 25:03.180]  Sorry.
[25:03.180 --> 25:05.180]  That may not be an option for most of you guys.
[25:05.180 --> 25:09.180]  So, in this case, you're going to need to order your seeds online.
[25:09.180 --> 25:15.180]  Now, if you're in the United States, I strongly recommend naturesgreenremedies.com.
[25:15.180 --> 25:18.180]  My company has a great working relationship with Nature's Green Remedies.
[25:18.580 --> 25:25.580]  I'm friends with most of the breeders stocked on Nature's Green Remedies and I trust everyone that I've done business with involved with Nature's Green Remedies.
[25:25.580 --> 25:29.580]  So, I strongly recommend naturesgreenremedies.com for seeds in the U.S.
[25:29.580 --> 25:33.580]  Like I said, expect to pay around a hundred dollars for a ten-pack of seeds.
[25:33.580 --> 25:35.580]  Sometimes you get a twelve-pack.
[25:35.580 --> 25:37.580]  Some brands are a little cheaper.
[25:37.580 --> 25:38.580]  Some are slightly higher.
[25:38.580 --> 25:42.580]  Feminized seeds often run a little more expensive because they're harder to produce.
[25:42.580 --> 25:47.580]  You get way less feminized seeds out of a breeding project than you do regular seeds.
[25:47.980 --> 25:49.980]  It takes more time. It takes more space. It takes more energy.
[25:49.980 --> 25:52.980]  So, of course, we want more money for that.
[25:52.980 --> 25:54.980]  I do not charge my regular seeds.
[25:54.980 --> 25:56.980]  My feminized seeds are the same price.
[25:56.980 --> 25:58.980]  I charge the same price all the way around.
[25:58.980 --> 26:02.980]  Nature's Green Remedies uses discreet.
[26:02.980 --> 26:03.980]  That's discreet.
[26:03.980 --> 26:06.980]  That means they don't write, these are seeds on the package.
[26:06.980 --> 26:10.980]  Nature's Green Remedies uses discreet priority shipping.
[26:10.980 --> 26:12.980]  And they're right here in the United States.
[26:12.980 --> 26:15.980]  So, you know your seeds will arrive in just a few short days.
[26:16.380 --> 26:18.380]  They don't have to pass through customs and get held up.
[26:18.380 --> 26:20.380]  They take all kinds of time.
[26:20.380 --> 26:22.380]  America. They're right here in America.
[26:22.380 --> 26:25.380]  So, speaking of Nature's Green Remedies.

[27:23.180 --> 27:24.180]  I see.
[27:24.180 --> 27:25.180]  I was trying to figure out what was happening.
[27:25.180 --> 27:27.180]  It's like giving monkeys tools for the first time.
[27:27.180 --> 27:28.180]  You're like.
[27:28.180 --> 27:29.180]  You're fucking.

[27:36.180 --> 27:37.180]  Okay, sure.
[27:37.180 --> 27:38.180]  Sure.
[27:38.180 --> 27:39.180]  That's not me.
[27:39.180 --> 27:40.180]  It's like watching monkeys use tools.
[27:40.180 --> 27:41.180]  I don't know where I heard it, but that's not mine.
[27:41.180 --> 27:42.180]  Alright.

[29:20.980 --> 29:22.980]  Uh, it grows, uh, it grows.
[29:22.980 --> 29:25.140]  There are phenos that look like the golden goat.
[29:25.140 --> 29:29.700]  There are phenos that look like the Daybreaker and there's one right in the middle, buddy.
[29:29.700 --> 29:31.380]  There's almost no leaf on it.
[29:31.380 --> 29:35.180]  Daybreaker has big long fan leaves and no leaf so you don't have to trim it.
[29:35.180 --> 29:36.180]  Darn.
[29:36.180 --> 29:38.980]  And it's, uh, it's, it's, it's some head kicker.
[29:38.980 --> 29:39.980]  All right.
[29:39.980 --> 29:43.340]  So, uh, that lasts for one week, you guys.
[29:43.340 --> 29:46.980]  Uh, hopefully I don't run out because I packaged up a bunch.
[29:46.980 --> 29:47.980]  Hopefully I do run out.
[29:47.980 --> 29:51.420]  Hopefully I have to fucking message you guys and be like, I have to give you a 10 pack
[29:51.420 --> 29:54.140]  of something in substitute because you ran me out.

[32:20.160 --> 32:23.480]  This one is still not even guaranteed to be any good.
[32:23.480 --> 32:24.480]  They're all good, man.

[32:45.080 --> 32:48.840]  I just got tickets for that freaking oddball comedy show.
[32:48.840 --> 32:54.080]  I looked at the prices for those and I was like, yeah, I'm probably not going to that
[32:54.080 --> 32:55.080]  one.
[32:55.080 --> 32:56.320]  Don't get the reserve seating at all.
[32:56.320 --> 32:57.320]  Don't even look at those.
[32:57.320 --> 32:59.320]  Go to the ones underneath those.
[32:59.320 --> 33:00.320]  Okay.
[33:00.320 --> 33:01.320]  All right.
[33:01.320 --> 33:02.320]  63 feet.
[33:02.320 --> 33:03.320]  Yeah.
[33:03.320 --> 33:04.320]  Comedy show would be dope.
[33:04.320 --> 33:06.320]  Still 63 is a little bit much for me right now.
[33:06.320 --> 33:07.320]  I agree.
[33:07.320 --> 33:08.320]  I agree.
[33:08.320 --> 33:09.320]  Yeah.
[33:09.320 --> 33:10.320]  Got to pay some bills before that happens.
[33:10.320 --> 33:11.320]  But yeah.
[33:11.320 --> 33:12.320]  Well, we just paid all the bills here.
[33:12.320 --> 33:13.320]  I got something in my nose.
[33:13.320 --> 33:18.560]  So if I sneeze on the show, it'll be the second time I've ever sneezed on a podcast.
[33:19.280 --> 33:22.000]  So this is episode 25 and it feels like a milestone in the podcast world.
[33:22.000 --> 33:26.040]  They say that your show isn't anywhere until you've done 25 episodes.
[33:26.040 --> 33:29.320]  They say don't expect any listener interaction.
[33:29.320 --> 33:30.320]  Don't expect a tweet.
[33:30.320 --> 33:31.760]  Don't expect a comment.
[33:31.760 --> 33:36.920]  Don't expect a five star review at least until you've gotten 25 episodes under your belt.
[33:36.920 --> 33:41.920]  And I do have to give a little bit of respect to the podcast that helped me get my feet
[33:41.920 --> 33:43.240]  wet and learn how to do podcasting.
[33:43.240 --> 33:45.400]  It was 719 the blocks podcast.
[33:45.400 --> 33:46.400]  No disrespect to those guys.
[33:46.400 --> 33:49.560]  I just had to end that relationship and or not that relationship, that podcast.
[33:49.560 --> 33:51.480]  I didn't have time for that shit anymore.
[33:51.480 --> 33:53.160]  So shout out to those guys.
[33:53.160 --> 33:55.960]  It's kind of where I got my feet wet and podcast answer, man.
[33:55.960 --> 33:56.960]  Dude, you taught me a lot of shit.
[33:56.960 --> 34:02.240]  I know you don't listen to my show, but Cliff Ravenscraft taught me a lot about podcasting.
[34:02.240 --> 34:06.800]  So since we're doing all that, I should send some love to a lot of people.
[34:06.800 --> 34:12.360]  Big shout out to Kevin, of course, Adam, Tony, Clint, Jesse, Spencer, the whole Garden of

[35:04.900 --> 35:05.900]  this long.
[35:05.900 --> 35:09.240]  I'm finally comfortable on a microphone and I've learned what I'm doing with the recording
[35:09.240 --> 35:13.080]  gear so stick with me and I'll bring you grow advice and cannabis news every week until
[35:13.080 --> 35:15.480]  they make me freaking stop.
[35:15.480 --> 35:16.480]  I hope I didn't miss anyone.
[35:16.480 --> 35:18.880]  If I did, please know that I love you.
[35:18.880 --> 35:20.360]  Dab the fuck out and I'm on the spot.
[35:20.360 --> 35:24.120]  So it's time to take a celebration dab because episode 25 is going well.
[35:24.120 --> 35:25.120]  We got the shout outs done.
[35:25.120 --> 35:26.240]  We got the commercials done.
[35:26.240 --> 35:27.560]  We got the contest out.
[35:27.560 --> 35:28.760]  It's time for a dab.
[35:28.760 --> 35:31.400]  I feel good after giving all those people a shout out on the show.
[35:31.400 --> 35:32.840]  It's good, man.
[35:32.840 --> 35:33.840]  It's good.
[35:33.840 --> 35:35.440]  It's a lot of people.
[35:35.440 --> 35:36.440]  You know, I mean.
[35:36.440 --> 35:37.440]  That covers most everyone.
[35:37.440 --> 35:42.360]  I want to give one special shout out to fucking toughest dude I know pops, man.
[35:42.360 --> 35:43.960]  He fucking is beating shit.
[35:43.960 --> 35:44.960]  It's awesome.
[35:44.960 --> 35:46.440]  I thought he might show up here tonight for the show.
[35:46.440 --> 35:48.160]  I wasn't sure.
[35:48.160 --> 35:49.440]  But yeah, big shout out to pops.
[35:49.440 --> 35:52.600]  A big shout out to Joffrey and Cara pops.
[35:52.600 --> 35:54.200]  Pops was really battling some.
[35:54.200 --> 35:55.760]  Can we say what pops was working with pops?
[35:55.760 --> 35:56.760]  Yeah.
[35:56.760 --> 35:59.200]  Pops had lung cancer and he looked like hell.
[35:59.200 --> 36:03.040]  Pops looked like a skeleton several months ago and with the little treatments from his
[36:03.040 --> 36:06.200]  doctor, not little treatments, fucking big ass treatments from his doctor that almost
[36:06.200 --> 36:10.560]  plowed the shit out of pops and the love from Kevin and the nurturing from Kevin and
[36:10.560 --> 36:12.520]  also the help of cannabis.
[36:12.520 --> 36:14.800]  Pops looks like a freaking million bucks now.
[36:14.800 --> 36:19.360]  The help from from from Jeff and Irie and the whole cannabis community, man, there were
[36:19.360 --> 36:24.160]  a lot of there were a lot of people who gave free donations just to help out his cause
[36:24.160 --> 36:26.520]  because he couldn't smoke anymore and things like that.
[36:26.520 --> 36:27.520]  So that's what it's about.
[36:27.520 --> 36:28.520]  Really.
[36:28.520 --> 36:31.280]  You know, he gained weight throughout his entire treatment.
[36:31.280 --> 36:35.260]  The only bad news we received was the original cancer.
[36:35.320 --> 36:39.180]  So cannabis has done a lot for the man.
[36:39.180 --> 36:45.260]  He's made sure he could eat and kept him going through all those those hard treatments.
[36:45.260 --> 36:48.900]  And we're just waiting on the scan next month to see what the final answer is.
[36:48.900 --> 36:51.260]  But he's he says he has more energy.
[36:51.260 --> 36:54.220]  He feels better than he has in over three years.
[36:54.220 --> 36:56.620]  So, I mean, he looks better.
[36:56.620 --> 36:59.020]  He's it's awesome.
[36:59.020 --> 37:00.540]  Take care of yourselves, guys.
[37:01.020 --> 37:07.020]  I have to thank the community for that, because very little came from me, to be quite honest.
[37:07.020 --> 37:10.380]  I bought what I could, but I was limited as well.
[37:10.380 --> 37:12.660]  And I got a lot of free things from a lot of good people.
[37:12.660 --> 37:14.900]  And I appreciate that.
[37:14.900 --> 37:17.780]  That's what this community is for as growers and breeders.
[37:17.780 --> 37:20.140]  We if you're doing it right, you do OK.
[37:20.140 --> 37:21.420]  So we got to pay it forward.
[37:21.420 --> 37:22.420]  We got to kick it down.
[37:22.420 --> 37:23.820]  Have you guys noticed that shit?
[37:23.820 --> 37:24.820]  We try not to be stingy.
[37:24.820 --> 37:26.700]  And I mean, I've only been here a couple of months.
[37:26.700 --> 37:31.860]  And let me just say that it's one thing hearing about it, you know, from Internet and and
[37:31.860 --> 37:33.300]  other sources and things like that.
[37:33.300 --> 37:34.900]  But seeing it for yourself, it's great, man.
[37:34.900 --> 37:38.140]  Like it's what he's speaking is the truth out here.
[37:38.140 --> 37:43.500]  You know, it's I have to give a huge thanks to Joey from Natural Mystic Caregivers and
[37:43.500 --> 37:44.500]  Selected Nicotine.
[37:44.500 --> 37:50.500]  Both they fucking hooked it up with oil capsules that went directly to him and essential caps,
[37:50.500 --> 37:51.500]  right?
[37:51.500 --> 37:52.500]  Yeah.
[37:52.500 --> 37:53.500]  The essential caps.
[37:53.500 --> 37:54.500]  I've heard a lot of good things about those.
[37:54.500 --> 37:56.060]  They don't they don't pay me to say this.
[37:56.420 --> 37:57.420]  I've paid sponsors.
[37:57.420 --> 37:58.420]  No, no, no.
[37:58.420 --> 37:59.420]  Didn't pay anything.
[37:59.420 --> 38:00.660]  I've heard a lot of good things about those.
[38:00.660 --> 38:02.660]  And the the mystic caps from Joey.
[38:02.660 --> 38:04.940]  I ran into him just walk leaving.
[38:04.940 --> 38:09.460]  Actually, I ran into him right in the middle of two places and I kind of told him how I
[38:09.460 --> 38:10.460]  was doing.
[38:10.460 --> 38:12.500]  And he asked about my dad because he had met him before.
[38:12.500 --> 38:16.900]  And I told him and he reached in his bag and gave me some of those mystic caps that won
[38:16.900 --> 38:18.140]  the Cannabis Cup Award.
[38:18.140 --> 38:21.740]  Just give me just give and just hear like you give these to your dad.
[38:21.740 --> 38:22.740]  I did.
[38:23.420 --> 38:24.660]  It's just been amazing.
[38:24.660 --> 38:29.780]  The love and support I've gotten from everybody and the love that's gone to him.
[38:29.780 --> 38:30.780]  It's awesome.
[38:30.780 --> 38:31.780]  The community really works like that, man.
[38:31.780 --> 38:32.780]  You show it love.
[38:32.780 --> 38:33.780]  It does.
[38:33.780 --> 38:34.780]  It gives you love back.
[38:34.780 --> 38:35.780]  It really does.
[38:35.780 --> 38:37.900]  I had another friend.
[38:37.900 --> 38:41.780]  I don't know if he wants me to shout him out on a podcast, but a friend of a friend came
[38:41.780 --> 38:47.020]  down with stage four liver cancer and it was in deep shit was actually looked worse than
[38:47.020 --> 38:48.020]  pops looks.
[38:48.020 --> 38:52.220]  And I'm not trying to level the only thing that was going to work for this cat was RSO.
[38:52.700 --> 38:55.980]  And I posted on Facebook, I need some RSO and I got it within five days.
[38:55.980 --> 38:56.980]  I remember that.
[38:56.980 --> 38:57.980]  Yeah.
[38:57.980 --> 38:58.980]  Yeah.
[38:58.980 --> 38:59.980]  It delivered from Leadville.
[38:59.980 --> 39:04.180]  That's like fucking eight or nine hours away from here to just a friend of a friend who
[39:04.180 --> 39:06.140]  that's compassionate care right there.
[39:06.140 --> 39:07.620]  You know, they knew it wasn't for me.
[39:07.620 --> 39:09.180]  They knew that that was for that guy.
[39:09.180 --> 39:10.500]  I wasn't asking for it.
[39:10.500 --> 39:12.300]  And they're like, yeah, we got it, man.
[39:12.300 --> 39:13.300]  Hooked him up.
[39:13.300 --> 39:16.620]  So if you have somebody, if anybody out there, this shout out for you.
[39:16.620 --> 39:20.340]  If you hook up medical patients, if you don't charge your medical patients, if you give
[39:20.620 --> 39:22.780]  medical patients extra, I know you've got to recoup your light fees.
[39:22.780 --> 39:23.780]  You got to pay for your soil.
[39:23.780 --> 39:24.780]  You got to do that shit.
[39:24.780 --> 39:27.460]  So charge them the bare minimum.
[39:27.460 --> 39:31.260]  If you guys are hooking up cancer patients with RSO, if you're doing that kind of shit,
[39:31.260 --> 39:32.260]  you know who you are.
[39:32.260 --> 39:34.180]  If you deserve a shout out for this shit, big ups.
[39:34.180 --> 39:36.780]  If you're a medical provider, big love, respect.
[39:36.780 --> 39:37.780]  Thank you.
[39:37.780 --> 39:38.780]  That's a shout out for you.
[39:38.780 --> 39:39.780]  You guys don't get enough attention paid to you.
[39:39.780 --> 39:40.780]  You don't get enough love.
[39:40.780 --> 39:45.900]  Some of you guys are just balling out, looking like gangsters, living off the caregiver life.
[39:46.900 --> 39:52.220]  Some of you guys are doing it proper and mad love for that because it's hard to do it proper.
[39:52.220 --> 39:57.340]  Growing that medical grade herb with no sprays, no crazy shit on it is definitely a challenge.
[39:57.340 --> 39:58.340]  All right.
[39:58.340 --> 39:59.340]  That's crazy stuff, man.
[39:59.340 --> 40:04.140]  I want to keep the grow lessons coming and shit and always do episodes with news.
[40:04.140 --> 40:09.060]  If you guys want to hear me talk about something, something random, something like this guy,
[40:09.060 --> 40:11.380]  the whole seed topic today just happened to be good timing.
[40:11.380 --> 40:15.340]  I had a giveaway planned and that guy asked about where to get seeds.
[40:15.780 --> 40:18.700]  Hopefully he's listening to episode 25 and he can get seeds.
[40:18.700 --> 40:20.380]  He knows the laws and regulations.
[40:20.380 --> 40:23.620]  He doesn't even have to buy some iRee Genetics products right now.
[40:23.620 --> 40:28.140]  I think his email said he's in California, so he's cool to grow herb.
[40:28.140 --> 40:30.620]  He's got that 215 and it's legal out there.
[40:30.620 --> 40:31.620]  Good deal.
[40:31.620 --> 40:34.340]  He doesn't have to even buy iRee Genetics products.
[40:34.340 --> 40:40.460]  He can go buy some Rare Dankness or some La Plata, some Durango OG if they've got that
[40:40.460 --> 40:41.460]  shit in stock.
[40:41.460 --> 40:42.460]  What was that?
[40:42.460 --> 40:44.660]  That alien, lemon alien?
[40:44.980 --> 40:47.100]  I'm not sure if that's available anywhere.
[40:47.100 --> 40:50.100]  I don't know if it's available, but it looked ridiculous.
[40:50.100 --> 40:54.300]  Or Gage Green Genetics, Scarlet Kush or Starlet Kush or Asperare.
[40:54.300 --> 40:55.300]  I'm trying not to call.
[40:55.300 --> 40:56.300]  Oh, there it was.
[40:56.300 --> 40:57.300]  Okay, I'm better now.
[40:57.300 --> 40:59.780]  I should have just let it happen.
[40:59.780 --> 41:04.460]  But go get some of those and then use that coupon code, episode25.
[41:04.460 --> 41:10.340]  It's all one word, capital E and then the number 25, episode25.
[41:10.340 --> 41:15.700]  You get a free five pack of iRee gear and I don't want anything except your loyal listenership,
[41:15.700 --> 41:17.100]  which is pretty awesome.
[41:17.100 --> 41:18.100]  Yep.
[41:18.100 --> 41:19.100]  Yeah.
[41:19.100 --> 41:20.100]  Yeah.
[41:20.100 --> 41:21.100]  Yeah.
[41:21.100 --> 41:23.100]  So if you want to hear me talk about some shit, just tweet me, message me.
[41:23.100 --> 41:24.100]  I'll talk about it.
[41:24.100 --> 41:25.100]  We'll discuss it.
[41:25.100 --> 41:26.100]  We'll talk about it on the show.
[41:26.100 --> 41:27.100]  Let's see.
[41:27.100 --> 41:28.100]  Let's see.
[41:28.100 --> 41:30.740]  I've learned what I'm doing with recording gear.
[41:30.740 --> 41:31.740]  I knew that part.
[41:31.740 --> 41:32.740]  Where am I?
[41:32.740 --> 41:33.740]  I missed.
[41:33.740 --> 41:34.740]  I lost my fucking...
[41:34.740 --> 41:35.740]  Somebody point to this paper and I'll just start reading there.
[41:35.740 --> 41:37.860]  I'm not really sure where you were on that paper.
[41:38.100 --> 41:42.020]  You can message me at agroculture on hotmail.com or you can tweet me at agroculture.
[41:42.020 --> 41:44.940]  You can find me on Facebook under agroculture.
[41:44.940 --> 41:48.660]  If you don't want me to say your name on the show, just let me know in your message and
[41:48.660 --> 41:49.820]  I'll keep your identity private.
[41:49.820 --> 41:52.740]  I know that I got to keep some people in Texas and Oklahoma.
[41:52.740 --> 41:54.380]  Can't let anybody know they're growing and shit.
[41:54.380 --> 41:56.780]  So I won't bust you out.
[41:56.780 --> 42:01.900]  If you leave a comment on iTunes or Stitcher, I'll try to read those on a future episode.
[42:01.900 --> 42:04.500]  Big shout out to TaskRock for the song that's playing.
[42:05.500 --> 42:06.500]  We got a couple minutes to kill.
[42:06.500 --> 42:09.820]  You guys got a topic you want to bring up?
[42:09.820 --> 42:11.060]  You had a couple topics earlier.
[42:11.060 --> 42:12.820]  Oh yeah, bro.
[42:12.820 --> 42:16.980]  Colorado Springs has banned the use of butane extraction.
[42:16.980 --> 42:18.820]  Yeah, as far as I know...
[42:18.820 --> 42:23.300]  You're going to celebrate the banning of butane extraction by taking a fat, chunky dad?
[42:23.300 --> 42:24.300]  Is that what you're going to do?
[42:24.300 --> 42:26.420]  I asked, honestly.
[42:26.420 --> 42:27.420]  That's going to happen.
[42:27.420 --> 42:28.420]  Okay.
[42:28.420 --> 42:29.420]  Go for your thing, Kevin.
[42:29.420 --> 42:30.900]  There's not a lot of details on it.
[42:30.900 --> 42:31.900]  I'll turn Adam's mic off.
[42:31.900 --> 42:34.820]  There's not a lot to say about it.
[42:34.820 --> 42:42.340]  However, for those who haven't caught the message yet, Colorado Springs has put a moratorium
[42:42.340 --> 42:48.460]  on butane extraction, including in a closed loop system and under all these new regulations
[42:48.460 --> 42:51.220]  that have been put on the extraction labs.
[42:51.220 --> 42:53.780]  Can you dumb that down just a little bit?
[42:53.780 --> 42:55.620]  Like, I don't really understand.
[42:55.620 --> 42:57.100]  So they're saying no more blasting?
[42:57.100 --> 42:58.100]  Yeah, pretty much.
[42:58.100 --> 42:59.100]  Okay.
[42:59.100 --> 43:00.100]  Exactly.
[43:00.100 --> 43:01.100]  You can't do it open, which are the new regulations.
[43:01.300 --> 43:05.620]  You have to have closed loop system and a certain type of environment under certain
[43:05.620 --> 43:08.500]  code and things like that.
[43:08.500 --> 43:13.560]  But now they're outlawing even that in Colorado Springs.
[43:13.560 --> 43:23.800]  And apparently what it was is one guy from, I forget his name, from some building department
[43:23.800 --> 43:31.600]  or something in Springs kind of decided that these electrical codes and certain things
[43:31.600 --> 43:37.040]  were not sufficient to even have a closed loop system in.
[43:37.040 --> 43:43.800]  So here the industry is, there's a lot of people making new rooms and everything under
[43:43.800 --> 43:48.280]  all these new codes that follow all these guidelines.
[43:48.280 --> 43:51.940]  And this guy just came in and said that wasn't good enough.
[43:52.080 --> 43:58.420]  And apparently this department has final say over fire department and all this other stuff.
[43:58.420 --> 43:59.420]  So-
[43:59.420 --> 44:04.140]  If you guys hear that cough in the background, that's Adam being a big sissy.
[44:04.140 --> 44:07.140]  So they're working to figure it out.
[44:07.140 --> 44:16.660]  And I think the guy, from what I understand, is going to tell the industry what he wants
[44:16.660 --> 44:19.260]  is his regulations or whatever.
[44:19.260 --> 44:28.060]  And it may be, like the video I saw, they said it may be a week, it may be a year before
[44:28.060 --> 44:29.060]  this is fixed.
[44:29.060 --> 44:31.860]  You just never know with this stuff.
[44:31.860 --> 44:33.920]  It's just happened yesterday afternoon.
[44:33.920 --> 44:34.920]  So that's-
[44:34.920 --> 44:36.140]  Do you know how many extraction-
[44:36.140 --> 44:37.140]  Animal.
[44:37.140 --> 44:41.940]  So this is, open blasting is actually technically illegal anyway.
[44:41.940 --> 44:44.780]  This is only relating to dispensary OPC grows.
[44:44.780 --> 44:48.980]  So state regulated, MED regulated grows that are blasting their products.
[44:49.700 --> 44:50.700]  It's not even blasting anymore at this point.
[44:50.700 --> 44:53.180]  It's processing in a closed loop system.
[44:53.180 --> 45:00.540]  How many of those legal MED regulated MIPS, OPC regulated blasting sites, processing facilities,
[45:00.540 --> 45:01.620]  I guess we'll call them.
[45:01.620 --> 45:05.660]  How many of those do you think or know of in Colorado Springs?
[45:05.660 --> 45:07.540]  I know of two for sure.
[45:07.540 --> 45:13.300]  I know there's probably a couple more just because some of the dispensaries have their
[45:13.300 --> 45:17.640]  own MIPS license and stuff that they can process under.
[45:18.240 --> 45:24.480]  I know two of for sure and one's fairly new to Colorado and that's kind of a bummer.
[45:24.480 --> 45:25.480]  Yeah.
[45:25.480 --> 45:28.880]  Because they just spent a lot of money building their-
[45:28.880 --> 45:32.200]  They just popped a lot of seeds.
[45:32.200 --> 45:36.040]  And it's getting shut down now, which is, you know, that's-
[45:36.040 --> 45:39.120]  They can still run their garden, but they can't extract it.
[45:39.120 --> 45:40.120]  With butane.
[45:40.120 --> 45:45.240]  You can still run CO2, you can still run water, but-
[45:45.560 --> 45:49.600]  The garden that we're talking about that, okay, a garden in Springs that was actually
[45:49.600 --> 45:50.880]  being grown.
[45:50.880 --> 45:53.880]  So what happens guys, if you're listening from, we've got a listener that listens in
[45:53.880 --> 45:54.880]  London.
[45:54.880 --> 45:56.360]  So we have to keep in mind that-
[45:56.360 --> 45:57.360]  Respect, dude.
[45:57.360 --> 45:58.360]  Yeah.
[45:58.360 --> 45:59.360]  Thank you.
[45:59.360 --> 46:00.360]  But we have to keep in mind that not everybody-
[46:00.360 --> 46:01.360]  My mic sounds funny.
[46:01.360 --> 46:02.360]  Okay.
[46:02.360 --> 46:03.360]  It's just the music.
[46:03.360 --> 46:04.560]  We have to keep in mind that not everybody knows Colorado shit.
[46:04.560 --> 46:10.880]  These places grow a large garden, like a thousand plants, and they harvest the entire garden
[46:10.960 --> 46:16.480]  and then they run all of that through a closed loop butane extraction machine and turn all
[46:16.480 --> 46:20.880]  of it into hash, into BHO, dabs, shatter-
[46:20.880 --> 46:23.160]  Processed marijuana concentrate.
[46:23.160 --> 46:24.160]  Yes.
[46:24.160 --> 46:30.840]  And that sells for somewhere between, depending on where and who, between 30 and 60 a gram.
[46:30.840 --> 46:34.680]  And if you're getting into live resin, it's 85 to a hundred dollars a gram.
[46:34.680 --> 46:40.980]  So these guys are making large portions and portioning it up into grams and then they
[46:40.980 --> 46:44.620]  deliver it back to the dispensary and then the dispensary sells it.
[46:44.620 --> 46:48.960]  Or the dispensary takes their grow that they have leftovers of and sends it to the extraction
[46:48.960 --> 46:52.200]  company for them to blast or process.
[46:52.200 --> 46:56.240]  And then they take all of that product back to the shop and sell it on the shelves.
[46:56.240 --> 47:00.160]  So these guys are growing large, large gardens just for processing.
[47:00.160 --> 47:04.960]  So what I see them doing, you run your large garden, you chop it, you dry it, you drive
[47:04.960 --> 47:08.880]  it up to Denver to your processing facility or down to Pueblo to your processing facility
[47:08.880 --> 47:12.840]  where it's legal and then you run it there and then you just have to drive twice.
[47:12.840 --> 47:15.560]  Yeah, pretty much.
[47:15.560 --> 47:18.700]  So this is forcing closed loop systems, correct?
[47:18.700 --> 47:22.060]  Closed loops have been banned also in Colorado Springs as part of this moratorium.
[47:22.060 --> 47:24.560]  But the closed loop system is what the industry standard is now.
[47:24.560 --> 47:26.000]  You cannot blast open loop.
[47:26.000 --> 47:27.000]  That's what I'm saying.
[47:27.000 --> 47:31.640]  Is this not doing anything but upgrading the hash?
[47:31.640 --> 47:35.240]  It kind of sounds negative when it's coming from YouTube, but to me it sounds like more
[47:35.240 --> 47:38.520]  people are going to be making unicorn hash and we're going to go away from the butane
[47:38.520 --> 47:39.520]  nasty...
[47:39.520 --> 47:42.280]  Well, they just banned, you can't even make unicorn hash now, which is a live resin you
[47:42.280 --> 47:43.280]  guys started with.
[47:43.280 --> 47:44.280]  Not in Colorado Springs.
[47:44.280 --> 47:45.880]  Yeah, you can't do any of it in Colorado Springs.
[47:45.880 --> 47:48.400]  It's going to drive the black market hash.
[47:48.400 --> 47:49.400]  Exactly.
[47:49.400 --> 47:54.920]  Now guys that are unlicensed like me, I'm a grower and I'm a breeder.
[47:54.920 --> 47:56.080]  I don't know how to make the dabs.
[47:56.160 --> 47:59.280]  Honestly, I'd let other people do that for me, but I'm going to have to.
[47:59.280 --> 48:02.600]  If I live in Colorado Springs, I can't get it now because it's not being made.
[48:02.600 --> 48:07.440]  I'm going to have to go in my backyard and open blast my own product, which is taking
[48:07.440 --> 48:12.000]  it back to where it was that caused a lot of the problems in the first place.
[48:12.000 --> 48:13.480]  But that's what prohibition does.
[48:13.480 --> 48:15.720]  It goes back and forth.
[48:15.720 --> 48:19.760]  They're just trying to re-prohibit prohibition.
[48:19.760 --> 48:21.920]  Colorado Springs is kind of a strange city anyway.
[48:21.920 --> 48:25.040]  For being such a big city, they've banned all the recreational cannabis.
[48:25.040 --> 48:26.040]  Now they're banning blasting.
[48:26.040 --> 48:29.120]  Yeah, it's a lot of military up there.
[48:29.120 --> 48:32.720]  Do you want to mention the event being pushed back?
[48:32.720 --> 48:33.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:33.720 --> 48:34.720]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[48:34.720 --> 48:35.720]  We got to talk about that.
[48:35.720 --> 48:36.720]  Big shout out to Daniel for making this decision.
[48:36.720 --> 48:37.720]  Secret Cup Mountain Region, man.
[48:37.720 --> 48:39.120]  And yeah, big up to him.
[48:39.120 --> 48:41.400]  I don't know if anybody is mad about it.
[48:41.400 --> 48:42.880]  I haven't heard any bad reviews on this decision.
[48:42.880 --> 48:44.240]  I haven't seen anything on it either.
[48:44.240 --> 48:45.920]  I think it's a great idea.
[48:45.920 --> 48:48.840]  He pushed the Mountain Region back.
[48:48.840 --> 48:51.720]  I'm sure it was a community decision to some extent.
[48:52.280 --> 48:55.360]  It wasn't just Big D going, no, I'm fucking doing this.
[48:55.360 --> 48:56.360]  That's just not how he does it.
[48:56.360 --> 48:58.000]  I feel like doing it tomorrow.
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.120]  But no, they had just wrapped up the East Coast.
[49:01.120 --> 49:02.120]  The Beast Coast.
[49:02.120 --> 49:03.120]  The Beast Coast.
[49:03.120 --> 49:04.760]  Shout out to Bobby Nugs.
[49:04.760 --> 49:06.240]  Apparently that was badass.
[49:06.240 --> 49:07.240]  Good job.
[49:07.240 --> 49:08.240]  I watched the video on it.
[49:08.240 --> 49:09.240]  Good job.
[49:09.240 --> 49:10.720]  They had some pretty high numbers and some pretty high-con-
[49:10.720 --> 49:17.880]  So after that, Secret Cup administrators decided that they needed to make Colorado the home
[49:17.880 --> 49:18.880]  state as badass.
[49:18.880 --> 49:19.880]  Secret Cup administrators.
[49:19.880 --> 49:20.880]  Yeah.
[49:21.040 --> 49:22.040]  Bobby and Jeremy?
[49:22.040 --> 49:23.040]  Yeah.
[49:23.040 --> 49:24.040]  Okay.
[49:24.040 --> 49:28.920]  As badass as the Beast Coast was, you know?
[49:28.920 --> 49:32.920]  They didn't feel like they could do that within a week and a half.
[49:32.920 --> 49:38.080]  They have had several venue changes, several issues with Denver.
[49:38.080 --> 49:40.120]  And the venues, they could get locked down.
[49:40.120 --> 49:43.800]  They finally have a good venue locked down and they're getting everything else squared
[49:43.800 --> 49:48.280]  away and they pushed it back to the end of September.
[49:48.280 --> 49:52.000]  So it's still happening and they want to just make it badass and not half-ass.
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.920]  So good job on that decision for sure.
[49:54.920 --> 49:57.800]  If anything, that'll leave more time for people to get ready.
[49:57.800 --> 50:03.960]  Also, Big D offered to pay any expenses that were extra incurred on people who had already
[50:03.960 --> 50:08.120]  had plane tickets that had to trade a man or anything like that.
[50:08.120 --> 50:12.880]  Like, he had posted right on Facebook that said, just prove to me what you're out and
[50:12.880 --> 50:13.880]  I'll take care of it.
[50:13.880 --> 50:17.320]  Like, if you need to back out of the competition or whatever, I understand.
[50:17.360 --> 50:18.360]  No big deal.
[50:18.360 --> 50:19.360]  We can refund that.
[50:19.360 --> 50:26.120]  So, I mean, he offered to fucking pay airline fees for changing tickets if there were, you know?
[50:26.120 --> 50:27.120]  That's awesome.
[50:27.120 --> 50:28.920]  And I was like, that's pretty cool, dude.
[50:28.920 --> 50:29.920]  That's a good man.
[50:29.920 --> 50:31.760]  Big D. Shout out, Big D.
[50:31.760 --> 50:35.760]  So yeah, if you guys are trying to come to the Secret Cup, the date has been changed.
[50:35.760 --> 50:37.800]  Have they announced the new date?
[50:37.800 --> 50:39.680]  September 27th or something, I think?
[50:39.680 --> 50:40.680]  They announced like the week.
[50:40.680 --> 50:43.720]  They said they'll probably pin down a date as it gets closer.
[50:43.720 --> 50:44.720]  That's kind of how they do it.
[50:44.720 --> 50:47.760]  He may have the date right, but I didn't really look since it's been posted.
[50:47.760 --> 50:50.760]  I want to say the 27th, 28th.
[50:50.760 --> 50:52.760]  Um, that's...
[50:52.760 --> 50:56.960]  Cool, because before it was the same day as a Phish concert.
[50:56.960 --> 50:59.720]  And uh, sorry, but Phish won.
[50:59.720 --> 51:04.720]  Yeah, it'll be that Saturday and Sunday, the 27th and 28th of September.
[51:04.720 --> 51:05.720]  Cool.
[51:05.720 --> 51:06.720]  Cool.
[51:06.720 --> 51:09.000]  You guys got any plugs you want to do?
[51:09.000 --> 51:10.440]  Where you want anybody to check out?
[51:10.440 --> 51:12.440]  Anybody you want to fucking mention while you got your airtime?
[51:12.440 --> 51:13.440]  Adam, regurthegov.
[51:14.160 --> 51:15.160]  Adam is at overgrowthegov.
[51:15.160 --> 51:19.680]  Twitch and whatever that other T one is.
[51:19.680 --> 51:20.680]  Twitter.
[51:20.680 --> 51:21.680]  There you go.
[51:21.680 --> 51:22.680]  Yeah, at overgrowthegov on Twitter.
[51:22.680 --> 51:23.680]  Yeah, find him there.
[51:23.680 --> 51:25.160]  Send him, send him filthy shit.
[51:25.160 --> 51:26.160]  He likes it.
[51:26.160 --> 51:27.160]  Yeah.
[51:27.160 --> 51:28.160]  Yeah.
[51:28.160 --> 51:29.160]  Kev, any shout outs, any plugs, advertising?
[51:29.160 --> 51:30.160]  Nah.
[51:30.160 --> 51:31.160]  No?
[51:31.160 --> 51:32.160]  I think we already said them.
[51:32.160 --> 51:33.160]  We already said all of them.
[51:33.160 --> 51:34.160]  We did a lot of cool shout outs.
[51:34.160 --> 51:35.160]  I was going to fucking say so.
[51:35.160 --> 51:36.160]  Shout out to Diamond Dave and the Compound.
[51:36.160 --> 51:37.160]  What up, Diamond Dave.
[51:37.160 --> 51:38.160]  I love you.
[51:38.160 --> 51:39.160]  I love you.
[51:39.160 --> 51:40.160]  I love you.
[51:40.160 --> 51:41.160]  I love you.
[51:41.160 --> 51:42.160]  I love you.
[51:42.160 --> 51:43.160]  I love you.
[51:43.880 --> 51:45.880]  I love to fuck with Dave, man.
[51:45.880 --> 51:47.880]  If he listens, that's it, man.
[51:47.880 --> 51:50.560]  Like, God, you're so fun to mess with.
[51:50.560 --> 51:53.160]  Big ups to our friends that are crushing it in Las Vegas.
[51:53.160 --> 51:55.320]  They've got a large grow facility in Clark County.
[51:55.320 --> 51:58.960]  I don't know if he wants me to say his name on a podcast or not, but he knows who he is.
[51:58.960 --> 52:02.160]  He's got that Hell's Angel OG that tested at 30% THC.
[52:02.160 --> 52:03.160]  What?
[52:03.160 --> 52:04.160]  Yeah.
[52:04.160 --> 52:05.160]  Yeah.
[52:05.160 --> 52:06.160]  It's a multiple cup winner.
[52:06.160 --> 52:07.160]  He's got the cup.
[52:07.160 --> 52:08.160]  You're the homie.
[52:08.160 --> 52:09.160]  Get the hook up.
[52:09.160 --> 52:10.160]  That's his Vegas prize.
[52:10.160 --> 52:11.160]  He's got a-
[52:11.160 --> 52:12.160]  Okay.
[52:12.160 --> 52:14.560]  He's got a huge production facility in Vegas, and that's the one that's going to make the
[52:14.560 --> 52:15.960]  man a million bucks.
[52:15.960 --> 52:17.640]  All right.
[52:17.640 --> 52:18.640]  My plugs.
[52:18.640 --> 52:19.640]  I guess it's my turn.
[52:19.640 --> 52:20.640]  Check me out.
[52:20.640 --> 52:22.480]  It's at I Grow Culture on Twitter.
[52:22.480 --> 52:25.680]  I post all the episode updates at I Grow Culture on Twitter.
[52:25.680 --> 52:27.280]  I'm going to just keep the music down for a minute.
[52:27.280 --> 52:28.280]  I like that.
[52:28.280 --> 52:29.280]  It's easier.
[52:29.280 --> 52:30.280]  At I Grow Culture.
[52:30.280 --> 52:31.280]  Yeah, where was I?
[52:31.280 --> 52:34.480]  At I Read Genetics on Instagram.
[52:34.480 --> 52:37.440]  I Grow Culture at Hotmail.com.
[52:37.440 --> 52:38.840]  There's more, but that's enough, dude.
[52:38.840 --> 52:39.840]  You guys know what's up, right?
[52:39.840 --> 52:40.840]  You know where to find me.
[52:40.840 --> 52:43.760]  I'm 25 episodes in.
[52:43.760 --> 52:45.000]  Where else would you want to find me?
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.360]  I don't even know.
[52:46.360 --> 52:49.000]  All right.
[52:49.000 --> 52:52.440]  There's constantly links to all your other things too from there.
[52:52.440 --> 52:53.760]  Yeah, I link it all up.
[52:53.760 --> 52:57.600]  As long as you find I Grow Culture on Twitter or I Read Genetics on Instagram or I Read
[52:57.600 --> 53:00.880]  Genetics on Twitter, you'll be happy.
[53:00.880 --> 53:01.880]  You'll find all of it.
[53:01.880 --> 53:02.880]  I link them up.
[53:02.880 --> 53:04.840]  So yeah, that's 25 episodes, you guys.
[53:04.840 --> 53:06.800]  I want to thank everybody for listening to the show.
[53:06.800 --> 53:09.360]  Send me tons of tweets and emails and Facebook messages.
[53:09.360 --> 53:11.160]  It's really cool.
[53:11.160 --> 53:12.160]  This part always sounds fun.
[53:12.160 --> 53:14.200]  We'll turn up some music for this.
[53:14.200 --> 53:15.880]  Now that the show's over, please go to iTunes.
[53:15.880 --> 53:16.960]  Go to the iTunes store.
[53:16.960 --> 53:18.640]  Search for I Grow Culture.
[53:18.640 --> 53:19.640]  Find the review section.
[53:19.640 --> 53:21.800]  Give me a five-star rating.
[53:21.800 --> 53:24.080]  After that, type in a comment and let me know what you think of the show.
[53:24.080 --> 53:25.880]  I will read your comments on the show.
[53:25.880 --> 53:29.600]  If you tell me that I'm awesome, if you tell me that I sound like fucking Charlie Brown's
[53:29.600 --> 53:33.560]  teacher, if you tell me I'm a stupid pothead, if you tell me I should be president, if you
[53:33.560 --> 53:37.000]  tell me I sound like Martians has landed and fucking cut off my brain, I'll say that on
[53:37.000 --> 53:38.000]  the show.
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  I'll do it.
[53:39.640 --> 53:42.720]  I'll read almost anything you type into that comment section, which is kind of scary for
[53:42.720 --> 53:43.720]  somebody to say.
[53:43.720 --> 53:49.960]  I just see the wheels turning in Adam's head as I say that.
[53:49.960 --> 53:58.520]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher, Swell.am, and also on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[53:58.520 --> 54:02.080]  The other day, Stitcher was messing up and not posting the episodes.
[54:02.080 --> 54:06.720]  If it freaks out, you guys, go find me on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[54:06.720 --> 54:07.720]  That's my website.
[54:07.720 --> 54:08.720]  I own that.
[54:09.440 --> 54:10.440]  I'm not going to go away.
[54:10.440 --> 54:12.560]  Every episode is posted there, one through 25.
[54:12.560 --> 54:14.560]  I promise I'll keep them coming.
[54:14.560 --> 54:16.440]  Shout out to my ninja Spence.
[54:16.440 --> 54:19.600]  Shout out to these boys for sitting through an hour-long episode with me and kicking ass.
[54:19.600 --> 54:20.600]  You guys stayed on the mics.
[54:20.600 --> 54:21.600]  You sounded great.
[54:21.600 --> 54:22.600]  Thanks for coming.
[54:22.600 --> 54:23.600]  Thanks for having me for the big two-five, man.
[54:23.600 --> 54:24.600]  It's been a little bit since I've been on.
[54:24.600 --> 54:25.600]  Sorry I was late, man.
[54:25.600 --> 54:26.600]  I was trying.
[54:26.600 --> 54:27.600]  Hey, it worked out well, man.
[54:27.600 --> 54:28.600]  It was perfect.
[54:28.600 --> 54:29.600]  Yeah, I wanted you on because you've been here from the start of that show.
[54:29.600 --> 54:30.600]  Even if we are second choice and all, it's...
[54:30.600 --> 54:31.600]  Thank you.
[54:31.600 --> 54:32.600]  I'm not going to go away.
[54:32.600 --> 54:33.600]  I'm not going to go away.
[54:33.600 --> 54:34.600]  I'm not going to go away.
[54:34.600 --> 54:36.600]  Even if we are second choice and all, it's...
[54:36.600 --> 54:37.600]  Thank you.
[54:37.600 --> 54:38.600]  Bringing it back.
[54:38.600 --> 54:39.600]  Good callback.
[54:39.600 --> 54:40.600]  I like it.
[54:40.600 --> 54:41.600]  You make me feel like shit all night.
[54:41.600 --> 54:42.600]  I'm going to cry.
[54:42.600 --> 54:45.600]  Shout out to my ninja Spence once again.
[54:45.600 --> 54:46.600]  What a dick.
[54:46.600 --> 54:47.600]  The A-team, you know?
[54:47.600 --> 54:48.600]  Thanks again for taking the...
[54:48.600 --> 54:49.600]  Yeah, thanks again for listening, you guys.
[54:49.600 --> 54:50.600]  I'm going to try to get that right.
[54:50.600 --> 54:51.600]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[54:51.600 --> 54:52.600]  Big shout out to TaskRock.
[54:52.600 --> 54:53.600]  We're going to turn up some music.
[54:53.600 --> 54:54.600]  We're going to take some dabs.
[54:54.600 --> 54:55.600]  You guys have a wonderful fucking evening.
[54:55.600 --> 54:56.600]  I'm going to find a specific song.
[54:56.600 --> 54:57.600]  I'm going to find a specific song.
[54:57.600 --> 54:58.600]  I'm going to find a specific song.
[54:58.600 --> 54:59.600]  I'm going to find a specific song.
[55:29.600 --> 55:30.600]  Oh.
[55:30.600 --> 55:31.600]  Oh.
[55:31.600 --> 55:32.600]  We mix.
[55:32.600 --> 55:33.600]  You sound scared.
[55:33.600 --> 55:34.600]  You sound scared.
[55:34.600 --> 55:35.600]  I'm just going to wait for you to hard
[55:35.600 --> 55:36.600]  You sound scared.
[55:36.600 --> 55:37.600]  I'm just going to wait for you to hard
[55:37.600 --> 55:38.600]  snare.
[55:38.600 --> 55:39.600]  I'm just going to wait for you to hard
[55:39.600 --> 55:40.600]  cut to it.
[55:40.600 --> 55:41.600]  Not even like transition.
[55:41.600 --> 55:42.600]  That's...
[55:42.600 --> 55:43.600]  Not even like transition.
[55:43.600 --> 55:44.600]  No, it's just going to be...
[55:44.600 --> 55:45.600]  Exactly.
[55:45.600 --> 55:46.600]  We'll fade out a little bit.
[55:46.600 --> 55:47.600]  You said you were getting this worked out.
[55:47.600 --> 55:48.600]  Where is your...
[55:48.600 --> 55:49.600]  How is it?
[55:49.600 --> 55:50.600]  It's getting a little better.
[55:50.600 --> 55:51.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for listening to episode number 25
[55:51.600 --> 55:52.600]  of the Hygro Culture producción...
[55:52.600 --> 55:53.600]  Sh钟tel.

[55:55.600 --> 55:56.600]  Yep, yep.
