[00:00.000 --> 00:01.920]  What's up, cannabis community?
[00:01.920 --> 00:06.260]  It is time for episode 477 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.260 --> 00:09.940]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.940 --> 00:14.940]  If you need new regular, feminized, or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds
[00:14.940 --> 00:22.680]  Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:22.680 --> 00:26.040]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:26.040 --> 00:31.580]  I just took a ridiculous dab of Chemdela Chem S1 Live Batter from our friends at Green
[00:31.580 --> 00:32.760]  Dot Labs.
[00:32.760 --> 00:35.660]  This is a blend of Chem D and I-95.
[00:35.660 --> 00:41.020]  On the package, the flavor is described as petrol, earth, and sour, and I will completely
[00:41.020 --> 00:42.520]  agree with that description.
[00:42.520 --> 00:45.300]  When you crack the jar open, it smells gassy.
[00:45.300 --> 00:47.540]  You get a nice gassy, earthy aroma.
[00:47.540 --> 00:52.040]  Then once that settles down, that is when that sour aroma kicks in.
[00:52.040 --> 00:56.160]  Then when I took a dab, the first thing I noticed was that gassy, pungent flavor hit
[00:56.160 --> 00:57.160]  my tongue.
[00:57.160 --> 01:02.080]  Then on the exhale, it got earthy, and then as it settles down, that gassy, sourness,
[01:02.080 --> 01:06.400]  skunkiness kind of settles on the tongue, and it gives me a really delicious kind of
[01:06.400 --> 01:11.220]  an aftertaste, sort of a thick layer of cottonmouth that I really enjoy.
[01:11.220 --> 01:17.520]  I've really been enjoying this trend in the gassy, garlicky, savory sort of flavors in
[01:17.520 --> 01:21.680]  the concentrates, or at least in my area, that seems to be a trend in the concentrates.
[01:22.200 --> 01:28.080]  I am really enjoying that gassy, garlicky sort of a trend, the Garlic Banger, the Chem
[01:28.080 --> 01:34.040]  de la Chem, the Fatso, the GMO, just about anything with that garlicky flavor to it.
[01:34.040 --> 01:37.400]  Of course, the Mac has got that pungent aroma to it.
[01:37.400 --> 01:41.480]  Anything on that end of the spectrum has been making me really happy lately.
[01:41.480 --> 01:47.400]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Chem de la Chem S1
[01:47.400 --> 01:48.400]  Live Batter.
[01:49.040 --> 01:53.000]  All right, in this episode, I'm going to read a couple of listener emails.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.720]  Before we get there, you know that I would like to do some shout outs to a few of our
[01:56.720 --> 01:59.400]  friends from Patreon.
[01:59.400 --> 02:03.560]  Let's start off with a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you
[02:03.560 --> 02:05.440]  to my friend, Glenn Gironi.
[02:05.440 --> 02:08.840]  How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to James
[02:08.840 --> 02:09.840]  Brown.
[02:09.840 --> 02:12.800]  How about a big thank you and a shout out and a fist bump to Brett G.
[02:12.800 --> 02:15.840]  Of course, a big giant thank you shout out to Jacob W.
[02:15.840 --> 02:19.560]  I want to send a giant handshake, a Grow From Your Heart fist bump and a thank you
[02:19.560 --> 02:21.000]  to Keith K.
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.280]  Of course, I want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you, a shout out,
[02:25.280 --> 02:28.240]  a fist bump, and a high five to Fat Rabbit.
[02:28.240 --> 02:31.120]  As always, a giant thank you shout out to Todd K.
[02:31.120 --> 02:36.120]  And last, but certainly not least, I want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
[02:36.120 --> 02:42.000]  shout out, a high five, and a thank you to my friend, Blackbird76.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.640]  I want to thank each and every one of you for the continued Patreon support.
[02:45.640 --> 02:49.520]  And if anybody out there would like to learn how to support the show on Patreon, you can
[02:49.520 --> 02:56.440]  do so by visiting www.patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[02:56.440 --> 02:59.880]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:59.880 --> 03:04.040]  All right, podcast world, this is the portion of the show where I start reading listener
[03:04.040 --> 03:05.040]  emails.
[03:05.040 --> 03:09.040]  I've got a nice pile of emails here in front of me, so let's not waste too much time.
[03:09.040 --> 03:11.760]  Let's get right to the first message.
[03:11.760 --> 03:15.240]  The first message in today's episode goes just like this.
[03:15.240 --> 03:17.840]  If this is aired, you can use my name.
[03:17.840 --> 03:20.000]  Hey, that is a great way to start a message.
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.800]  Big shout out to our friend, Eric.
[03:21.800 --> 03:23.600]  The message goes like this.
[03:23.600 --> 03:26.920]  Hey, Rasta Jeff, I love your show.
[03:26.920 --> 03:30.280]  I love the audio quality, the content, and your talking style.
[03:30.280 --> 03:31.960]  Hey, that's a great compliment right there.
[03:31.960 --> 03:36.040]  I'm glad that you appreciate the audio quality because I do put a little bit of work into
[03:36.040 --> 03:37.040]  that.
[03:37.040 --> 03:38.960]  I've got a lot of toys making me sound like a pro.
[03:38.960 --> 03:42.320]  I'm glad that you enjoy the content because that is all my brain coming out.
[03:42.480 --> 03:47.080]  It goes on to paper just a little bit, very minimal notes, and then I just talk and put
[03:47.080 --> 03:48.080]  it out there.
[03:48.080 --> 03:51.120]  I'm glad you're enjoying the content and my talking style.
[03:51.120 --> 03:52.360]  That's just me being me.
[03:52.360 --> 03:57.360]  I try to speak clearly and try to speak in a way that I think most people who speak English
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.040]  would be able to understand and comprehend what I'm saying.
[04:01.040 --> 04:02.040]  Thank you for that.
[04:02.040 --> 04:03.040]  Those are all great compliments.
[04:03.040 --> 04:04.040]  We should keep moving.
[04:04.040 --> 04:07.400]  It goes on to say, you should definitely be proud of the work you're doing here.
[04:07.400 --> 04:08.400]  Thank you.
[04:08.400 --> 04:09.400]  I appreciate that.
[04:09.400 --> 04:10.440]  The message continues.
[04:10.440 --> 04:14.920]  It says, I tried a few other shows and found that yours has just the right amount of fuck
[04:14.920 --> 04:20.600]  bombs and given that I'm a huge potty mouth, the Grow From Your Heart podcast is the show
[04:20.600 --> 04:22.520]  for me.
[04:22.520 --> 04:25.640]  That is a very interesting compliment and a very interesting statement.
[04:25.640 --> 04:29.400]  I'm glad that I'm dropping just the right amount of F-bombs for you.
[04:29.400 --> 04:34.760]  I try not to be a potty mouth, but I do try to be genuine and be myself and I say fuck
[04:34.760 --> 04:35.920]  sometimes.
[04:36.040 --> 04:40.840]  I do try to find that line between being professional, but also being genuinely myself.
[04:40.840 --> 04:41.840]  This is my show.
[04:41.840 --> 04:43.920]  I can say whatever I want to say.
[04:43.920 --> 04:47.680]  I feel like censoring myself too much makes me sound a little bit fake.
[04:47.680 --> 04:50.840]  When you do meet me and we hang out and I smell your weed, I'm going to go, that shit
[04:50.840 --> 04:51.840]  smells fucking good.
[04:51.840 --> 04:55.320]  You're going to look at me like, wow, I've never heard you use profanity before and I'm
[04:55.320 --> 04:56.480]  blown away by it.
[04:56.480 --> 04:58.240]  Now you already know that that's who I am.
[04:58.240 --> 05:00.120]  It's not surprising.
[05:00.120 --> 05:04.320]  People who have been listening to the show for a long time may remember that in the beginning,
[05:04.320 --> 05:08.920]  I tried to do a swear jar, just the old fashioned, every time you say the F word, you got to
[05:08.920 --> 05:10.800]  put a dollar in the swear jar.
[05:10.800 --> 05:11.800]  And then I did that.
[05:11.800 --> 05:16.200]  And eventually I gave that money to a patient who needed some assistance.
[05:16.200 --> 05:20.440]  Once I gave that money to somebody, I decided that was my final payment and I was allowed
[05:20.440 --> 05:25.640]  to say whatever I wanted on my show because there is no need to censor me from being myself.
[05:25.640 --> 05:28.400]  Speaking of being myself, I am stoned and way off track.
[05:28.400 --> 05:31.760]  So let's get back on track here with this email.
[05:31.760 --> 05:32.760]  It goes like this.
[05:32.760 --> 05:38.280]  Also, I am the senior optical technician for my dad's optical repair business.
[05:38.280 --> 05:42.360]  Basically, I repair binoculars, mostly antiques.
[05:42.360 --> 05:45.480]  Our shop is tucked into the back of my dad's property.
[05:45.480 --> 05:49.200]  We get the majority of our business shipped to us so we don't get many customers walking
[05:49.200 --> 05:50.520]  in.
[05:50.520 --> 05:55.520]  We listened to the GFYH podcast on the shop stereo for hours on end, and we have gone
[05:55.520 --> 06:00.640]  as far as the low 200s in your episode feed on iTunes.
[06:00.640 --> 06:01.640]  Wow, that's amazing.
[06:01.640 --> 06:03.280]  You're listening to the old stuff.
[06:03.280 --> 06:06.720]  You may actually stumble across that old swear jar episode.
[06:06.720 --> 06:10.280]  But I think that's awesome that you guys are listening to my show while you were working
[06:10.280 --> 06:11.280]  all day.
[06:11.280 --> 06:15.800]  I hope you're exposing some other employees to not only my F-bombs, but also to the grow
[06:15.800 --> 06:20.080]  knowledge and maybe just opening up their minds to cannabis in general.
[06:20.080 --> 06:24.160]  Maybe there's somebody in the crew who wasn't a big fan of cannabis and now you've accidentally
[06:24.160 --> 06:26.280]  turned them into an activist.
[06:26.280 --> 06:28.040]  I'm stoned and rambling.
[06:28.040 --> 06:29.240]  Let's keep moving with this email.
[06:29.240 --> 06:32.040]  It goes on to say, I am planning a grow.
[06:32.040 --> 06:35.120]  I'm growing for myself, my dad, and my mom.
[06:35.120 --> 06:39.120]  And we are in Oklahoma, so we are enjoying our new found freedom.
[06:39.120 --> 06:42.680]  Yeah, big shout out to all of our friends down there in Oklahoma.
[06:42.680 --> 06:46.880]  I've got quite a few friends who have left Colorado to head down to Oklahoma to help
[06:46.880 --> 06:48.360]  get started down there.
[06:48.360 --> 06:52.640]  And I've also made a lot of new friends who are in Oklahoma who are new to the cannabis
[06:52.640 --> 06:55.240]  industry who are getting started in the business.
[06:55.240 --> 06:59.920]  So big shout out to everybody down there in Oklahoma making the new medical marijuana
[06:59.920 --> 07:01.520]  movement happen.
[07:01.520 --> 07:05.920]  Let's keep moving with this email because I am obviously stoned and rambling.
[07:05.920 --> 07:09.480]  Our friend Eric here says, I have been studying a lot.
[07:09.480 --> 07:14.880]  I've been reading books, taking notes, and formulating my plan based on my grow style.
[07:14.880 --> 07:15.880]  I like that.
[07:15.880 --> 07:16.880]  That sounds very enthusiastic.
[07:16.880 --> 07:21.200]  It goes on to say, your show plays a huge part in that.
[07:21.200 --> 07:24.720]  I can imagine that your grow is going to look a little bit like my grow or at least
[07:24.720 --> 07:27.480]  the version of my grow that you have painted in your head.
[07:27.480 --> 07:29.960]  And I am really excited about that for you.
[07:29.960 --> 07:34.040]  It keeps going and it says, basically, I'm doing everything the way you'd say to do it
[07:34.040 --> 07:38.600]  and referencing my literature for finer details and specific information.
[07:38.600 --> 07:45.000]  I'm building a grow room in my garage that measures 4.5 feet by 8 feet that has an additional
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.280]  two by three closet that will house a mother, clones, and seedlings.
[07:49.280 --> 07:50.280]  All right.
[07:50.360 --> 07:52.520]  That sounds like we have a decent sized flower room.
[07:52.520 --> 07:55.800]  We've got a decent sized mom and clone area.
[07:55.800 --> 07:57.840]  It sounds like you're really off to a good start.
[07:57.840 --> 08:01.720]  You're reading books, you're listening to podcasts, and you were formulating a plan.
[08:01.720 --> 08:04.360]  It looks like you've got a nice floor plan made.
[08:04.360 --> 08:05.360]  Let's keep moving.
[08:05.360 --> 08:09.760]  It goes on to say, I have a lot of plans to optimize this grow space, but for now, I need
[08:09.760 --> 08:12.840]  to finish the main construction to get growing.
[08:12.840 --> 08:18.400]  Eventually, I'll build a nice big cabinet with an automated system and all of that.
[08:18.400 --> 08:19.400]  All right.
[08:19.520 --> 08:20.680]  I get that you're eager to get started.
[08:20.680 --> 08:24.720]  You just want to get things rolling so you can get growing, but my question is, why don't
[08:24.720 --> 08:29.280]  you just do it right the first time and build that big grow space that you dream of?
[08:29.280 --> 08:33.000]  Since you're building it in the garage, it's going to cost you time and money anyway.
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.480]  Why not just go big or go home on that first build instead of having to redo it all over
[08:37.480 --> 08:38.480]  again?
[08:38.480 --> 08:41.800]  I don't know your situation, but that would be my first question is, why aren't we just
[08:41.800 --> 08:44.000]  doing it the way we want to do it the first time?
[08:44.000 --> 08:45.200]  I don't want to do shit twice.
[08:45.200 --> 08:46.400]  We've got to do the work.
[08:46.400 --> 08:47.520]  We've got to spend the money.
[08:47.520 --> 08:48.520]  Let's just do it one time.
[08:48.640 --> 08:50.840]  But again, I don't know your situation.
[08:50.840 --> 08:52.780]  Maybe you don't have that space available.
[08:52.780 --> 08:53.840]  Maybe you don't have the budget.
[08:53.840 --> 08:54.840]  Maybe you don't have the time.
[08:54.840 --> 08:58.280]  I don't know your situation, but my first question is, why are we going to build it
[08:58.280 --> 08:59.280]  twice?
[08:59.280 --> 09:01.040]  Let's keep moving with the message it says.
[09:01.040 --> 09:06.480]  So for now, the actual grow space inside the grow room for veg and flour will be in a two
[09:06.480 --> 09:08.200]  by four grow tent.
[09:08.200 --> 09:12.640]  I really want to control the environment as best as possible, and I'm working with limited
[09:12.640 --> 09:13.640]  floor space.
[09:13.640 --> 09:14.640]  All right.
[09:14.640 --> 09:17.640]  So for the time being, we are working with very limited floor space.
[09:17.760 --> 09:21.080]  So we are going to grow in a two by four grow tent, it sounds like.
[09:21.080 --> 09:25.320]  And one of the main goals is to really control the environment as best as possible.
[09:25.320 --> 09:30.840]  That won't be too hard in such a small environment if that tent is in a larger room or a room
[09:30.840 --> 09:32.220]  which we can ventilate.
[09:32.220 --> 09:37.640]  So it goes on to say, I will be growing in a soilless mix using Fox Farms Ocean Forest
[09:37.640 --> 09:40.480]  and five gallon air pots under an LED light.
[09:40.480 --> 09:43.080]  That sounds like a great setup that will work well for you.
[09:43.080 --> 09:46.960]  I plan on using only a few nutrients, only what's needed.
[09:46.960 --> 09:51.680]  The small amount of nutrients that I do use will be what you have recommended.
[09:51.680 --> 09:55.760]  You can grow a very successful crop with very minimal nutrients if you pay attention to
[09:55.760 --> 09:56.760]  what you're doing.
[09:56.760 --> 10:02.920]  And I'm sure you'll be excited to hear that I am making progress on the full mix episode.
[10:02.920 --> 10:04.560]  I'm not ready to record that yet.
[10:04.560 --> 10:08.640]  I'm trying to make sure that I get it right because you guys are going to rely on that
[10:08.640 --> 10:09.640]  mix.
[10:09.640 --> 10:11.640]  I don't want to miss a single detail.
[10:11.640 --> 10:16.000]  So I'm working that very heavily before I press record, but I'm working on a full mix
[10:16.040 --> 10:20.280]  episode so you can know what I feed my plants every single week.
[10:20.280 --> 10:23.480]  So look forward to that, but let's keep moving on this email for now.
[10:23.480 --> 10:26.360]  It says, I will be growing your Arise.
[10:26.360 --> 10:31.400]  I plan on growing the shit out of Arise before moving on to any other strains.
[10:31.400 --> 10:33.040]  That is a very good idea.
[10:33.040 --> 10:37.680]  Pop a pack of Arise seeds, find a couple of keepers that you enjoy growing, grow those
[10:37.680 --> 10:41.680]  keepers a couple of times until you narrow it down to your favorite, then build a solid
[10:41.680 --> 10:46.760]  relationship with that one cultivar and really learn how to dial in that one plant to reach
[10:46.760 --> 10:47.840]  its full potential.
[10:47.840 --> 10:49.760]  That is a great strategy.
[10:49.760 --> 10:54.640]  It goes on to say, I bought your seeds on this past 420 from the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[10:54.640 --> 10:57.640]  So big shout out to my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[10:57.640 --> 11:00.920]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[11:00.920 --> 11:03.560]  Make sure you check them out if you need new seeds.
[11:03.560 --> 11:06.880]  So here is where we get to the question part of the podcast.
[11:06.880 --> 11:11.520]  It says, I have listened to your episode on Arise and I took notes on it as well.
[11:11.520 --> 11:17.480]  And as I am writing the rough draft for the veg phase of my plan, these questions came up.
[11:17.480 --> 11:19.800]  So our friend here is growing my strain Arise.
[11:19.800 --> 11:22.680]  I have done a full episode on the Arise strain.
[11:22.680 --> 11:26.520]  They are listening, they are taking notes, they are planning their grow, they are planning
[11:26.520 --> 11:30.720]  so far that they are writing down notes for the veg phase and they have come up with some
[11:30.720 --> 11:31.720]  questions.
[11:31.720 --> 11:33.520]  Let's get to the first question.
[11:33.520 --> 11:39.160]  The first question about Arise is, does Arise like to be scrogged?
[11:39.160 --> 11:43.440]  And by a scrog I mean a screen of green, which is when you put up a trellis net just
[11:43.440 --> 11:45.200]  above your canopy.
[11:45.200 --> 11:49.160]  Instead of letting that plant grow straight up, you use the net to bend it over and make
[11:49.160 --> 11:51.200]  it grow horizontally.
[11:51.200 --> 11:53.740]  And you can maximize your grow space.
[11:53.740 --> 11:57.440]  Instead of getting that plant straight up into the light, you can bend the plant over
[11:57.440 --> 11:59.160]  and it will grow sideways for a little bit.
[11:59.160 --> 12:01.000]  Then it will start to grow back up.
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.560]  As it starts to grow straight up again, you can grab that growth and tuck it under the
[12:04.560 --> 12:06.520]  next square in your trellis.
[12:06.840 --> 12:11.200]  You can fill that space and have the entire trellis filled with branching.
[12:11.200 --> 12:15.720]  When you flip it into flower, you will fill your entire grow area with buds.
[12:15.720 --> 12:19.240]  So the question here is, does Arise like to be scrogged?
[12:19.240 --> 12:21.280]  And the answer is yes.
[12:21.280 --> 12:24.260]  Arise takes very well to scrogging.
[12:24.260 --> 12:29.440]  Arise takes very well to popping and twisting and topping and all sorts of manipulation
[12:29.440 --> 12:30.480]  and training.
[12:30.480 --> 12:35.520]  And I will actually recommend that you do two, maybe three layers of trellis netting
[12:35.520 --> 12:37.320]  for your Arise plants.
[12:37.320 --> 12:40.440]  I generally use the first net as a spreader.
[12:40.440 --> 12:42.680]  My plant is growing up and it's getting tall, right?
[12:42.680 --> 12:44.840]  So I use that first net to spread it out.
[12:44.840 --> 12:49.000]  I want one branch through each square of my trellis net.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.840]  So I spread out the plant a little bit.
[12:50.840 --> 12:53.880]  The second one is to work it to control the height.
[12:53.880 --> 12:57.280]  That's when I start bending the plant down so it doesn't get too tall.
[12:57.280 --> 13:01.320]  That third one is to support those giant buds that are going to start developing around
[13:01.320 --> 13:04.700]  week four, five, six, and seven, eight, nine.
[13:04.700 --> 13:10.440]  You may need to consider adding another trellis, depending on how rapidly your buds are growing.
[13:10.440 --> 13:13.900]  This grow in question is happening in a grow tent with an LED light.
[13:13.900 --> 13:18.200]  So you may not need that first trellis net to work as a spreader as much.
[13:18.200 --> 13:21.420]  You may be able to use that one as your canopy control net.
[13:21.420 --> 13:23.660]  You'll just be able to bend the plants right into that one.
[13:23.660 --> 13:27.140]  You won't need that first net as a spreader because you don't have as many plants.
[13:27.140 --> 13:28.460]  You don't have as much growth.
[13:28.460 --> 13:32.260]  You don't have the plants pressed together as closely as I do in a commercial environment.
[13:32.260 --> 13:35.860]  In a commercial environment, I'm using double-ended Goveda lighting.
[13:35.860 --> 13:37.780]  I'm using three-gallon pots.
[13:37.780 --> 13:42.140]  I'm getting an auto-watering system, and I veg the plants much larger than what you're
[13:42.140 --> 13:44.680]  able to even put in your small grow tent.
[13:44.680 --> 13:50.660]  So I do require at least two, sometimes three, sometimes four layers of trellis netting in
[13:50.660 --> 13:52.140]  a commercial environment.
[13:52.140 --> 13:56.240]  So the short answer is yes, Arise loves to be scrogged.
[13:56.240 --> 14:00.140]  The next question is, what is her favorite light cycle?
[14:00.340 --> 14:04.700]  18 on, 6 off, or 16 on, 8 off?
[14:04.700 --> 14:06.300]  That is a very good question.
[14:06.300 --> 14:12.220]  I would suggest the 18 on and 6 off, but if you want to get experimental, I would almost
[14:12.220 --> 14:19.060]  suggest a 20 hours on and 4 hours off light cycle with Arise.
[14:19.060 --> 14:23.820]  Of course, you have to pay attention to your plant to dial this in, but I have noticed
[14:23.820 --> 14:26.680]  that Arise likes a lot of light.
[14:26.680 --> 14:29.740]  She has got some very tropical lineage to her.
[14:29.740 --> 14:34.020]  She's got a Hawaiian sativa and an island sweet skunk in her, so that means that she
[14:34.020 --> 14:38.740]  has got some tropical lineage, which means she probably was getting a lot of light and
[14:38.740 --> 14:42.500]  long daytime periods somewhere down the line in her gene pool.
[14:42.500 --> 14:48.660]  So I assume that several of her parents are used to getting a long daytime cycle, so Arise
[14:48.660 --> 14:50.740]  seems to want a lot of light.
[14:50.740 --> 14:52.820]  Now pay attention to your leaves.
[14:52.820 --> 14:56.260]  Plants have what is called the daily light integral.
[14:56.260 --> 14:58.700]  Once they've had enough light, they'll start shutting down.
[14:58.700 --> 15:00.260]  They will take a nap.
[15:00.260 --> 15:04.900]  You can see this at the end of the light cycle because the leaves just begin to droop.
[15:04.900 --> 15:07.100]  It looks like there's something wrong with the plants.
[15:07.100 --> 15:08.780]  There's absolutely nothing wrong.
[15:08.780 --> 15:12.620]  They've gotten enough light for the day and they just said, that's it, sweet dreams, and
[15:12.620 --> 15:13.700]  they just took a little nap.
[15:13.700 --> 15:16.960]  They just tipped their hat over their eyes, put their feet up and leaned back and took
[15:16.960 --> 15:18.660]  a little sleeper for a minute.
[15:18.660 --> 15:24.180]  So if you've got the opportunity to run 20 hours on and 4 hours off, I would do that
[15:24.180 --> 15:26.020]  and pay attention to the plants.
[15:26.060 --> 15:32.700]  Then if you see some of the plants starting to droop around 16, 17, 18 hours in, then
[15:32.700 --> 15:39.240]  you can start adjusting your timer accordingly, but don't go less than 18 on and 6 off.
[15:39.240 --> 15:44.500]  Because of those tropical genetics that I spoke of earlier, if you give Arise too little
[15:44.500 --> 15:49.060]  light and she gets root bound, she will decide to flower on you.
[15:49.060 --> 15:52.480]  If Arise becomes root bound, it will try to flower.
[15:52.480 --> 15:57.840]  So make sure you keep Arise in the appropriate size pot and make sure to give her plenty
[15:57.840 --> 15:59.160]  of light.
[15:59.160 --> 16:03.840]  So I would recommend starting with a 20 on and 4 off and paying attention to what happens
[16:03.840 --> 16:05.120]  to the plants.
[16:05.120 --> 16:09.920]  If they start looking like they're drooping late into the veg cycle, reduce it by an hour,
[16:09.920 --> 16:16.040]  reduce it by 2 hours, but don't go less than 18 on and 6 hours off because your plants
[16:16.040 --> 16:18.560]  may try to flower on you.
[16:18.680 --> 16:23.680]  Now one of the big advantages of running your lights for 20 on and 4 off is that when you
[16:23.680 --> 16:29.760]  do click that timer to 12, 12, those Arise plants are really going to trigger into flower
[16:29.760 --> 16:34.020]  quite quickly because you have just made a drastic change in the light cycle.
[16:34.020 --> 16:39.120]  They will have no question that it is time to kick in to flower gear.
[16:39.120 --> 16:44.160]  Now if you are unable or uncomfortable with running a 20 hour on and 4 hour off light
[16:44.160 --> 16:48.800]  cycle, 18 and 6 will work for your Arise plants.
[16:48.800 --> 16:52.560]  But I've been working with this strain for a very long time and I know that there are
[16:52.560 --> 16:59.040]  many phenotypes that would prefer a longer day time veg cycle.
[16:59.040 --> 17:03.680]  Alright Eric, I hope I helped you plan your grow and plan your veg cycle a little more
[17:03.680 --> 17:04.680]  closely.
[17:04.680 --> 17:07.440]  If you've got any more questions, please send me an email.
[17:07.440 --> 17:09.040]  You obviously know the email address.
[17:09.040 --> 17:11.560]  It is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[17:11.560 --> 17:13.120]  I look forward to hearing from you.
[17:13.120 --> 17:16.240]  He wraps up the message by saying, thank you for your time.
[17:16.240 --> 17:20.160]  We here at SuDarth Optical Repair love it when you ramble.
[17:20.160 --> 17:22.720]  Sincerely, Eric SuDarth.
[17:22.720 --> 17:24.800]  And then he added his CannaBuzz name.
[17:24.800 --> 17:27.740]  His CannaBuzz handle is DarthLightBender.
[17:27.740 --> 17:31.240]  So make sure you go follow DarthLightBender on CannaBuzz.
[17:31.240 --> 17:34.960]  Hey dude, once again, thank you for the great email.
[17:34.960 --> 17:37.540]  I'm going to keep moving right through the pile of emails.
[17:37.540 --> 17:40.480]  This next message goes just like this.
[17:40.480 --> 17:44.680]  It says, hey Rasta Jeff, I've been emailing intermittently with you and I just wanted
[17:44.680 --> 17:50.800]  to let you know I am starting to work with Arise as one of my long term project strains.
[17:50.800 --> 17:51.800]  That's really great.
[17:51.800 --> 17:54.360]  We've got two people talking about Arise in this episode.
[17:54.360 --> 17:55.440]  Let's keep moving with the message.
[17:55.440 --> 18:00.840]  It says, I have a diary started at growdiaries.com under the moniker of, I'm not sure if they
[18:00.840 --> 18:03.820]  want me to say their name, so I'm going to skip that.
[18:03.820 --> 18:07.920]  They go on to say, I am only in the first week as of now, but feel free to check it
[18:07.920 --> 18:09.360]  out from time to time.
[18:09.680 --> 18:14.840]  If you guys aren't aware, growdiaries.com is a great website and it's exactly what it
[18:14.840 --> 18:15.840]  sounds like.
[18:15.840 --> 18:19.580]  It is a very detailed grow diary.
[18:19.580 --> 18:25.260]  One of the things I really like about growdiaries.com is that I can click on iRegenetics and it
[18:25.260 --> 18:30.680]  shows me everybody who is growing or has grown an iRegenetics strain and made a diary on
[18:30.680 --> 18:31.680]  the website.
[18:31.680 --> 18:35.200]  So I can just scroll through and I can see our new friend here since he just gave me
[18:35.200 --> 18:36.200]  his name.
[18:36.200 --> 18:38.080]  I can see that he pops up and there he is.
[18:38.080 --> 18:43.240]  I can click on his diary and see his photos of a rise and any details or information that
[18:43.240 --> 18:47.960]  he has typed in to share with us will be easily accessible for me to look at.
[18:47.960 --> 18:50.400]  And then I can say, oh, he's feeding it that and that's what it's doing.
[18:50.400 --> 18:51.400]  Cool.
[18:51.400 --> 18:54.840]  And I can share that kind of info with other people who may want to grow that strain.
[18:54.840 --> 18:58.720]  Or you can go there yourself and just take a look at it if you're that type of an internet
[18:58.720 --> 18:59.720]  cruiser.
[18:59.720 --> 19:02.760]  Our buddy Grimball the Druid has a great grow diary.
[19:02.760 --> 19:08.040]  He has grown a lot of iRegenetics and some other stuff and he posts a lot of it to growdiaries.com.
[19:09.000 --> 19:10.280]  So go check him out.
[19:10.280 --> 19:11.580]  But I'm stoned and rambly.
[19:11.580 --> 19:13.880]  So let's get back on track.
[19:13.880 --> 19:14.880]  There is more.
[19:14.880 --> 19:19.280]  It says, I am sure you have some better shit to do than BS with me, but any advice along
[19:19.280 --> 19:21.600]  the way would not be refused.
[19:21.600 --> 19:23.040]  All right.
[19:23.040 --> 19:27.520]  My first piece of advice would be to check out episode number 329 of the Grow From Your
[19:27.520 --> 19:28.520]  Heart podcast.
[19:28.520 --> 19:31.560]  I did an entire episode about a rise.
[19:31.560 --> 19:36.280]  I'm going to assume you've already heard that, but if not, go check out number 329.
[19:36.280 --> 19:40.720]  I talk in depth about the Arise strain on episode 329.
[19:40.720 --> 19:41.720]  So check that out.
[19:41.720 --> 19:44.280]  And then I'm sure you just heard the two little add-ons I did.
[19:44.280 --> 19:50.240]  I talked about Scrogging Arise, and then we just talked about timing for Arise in Veg.
[19:50.240 --> 19:54.800]  So if you've got any more questions, please send me an email and I will do my best to
[19:54.800 --> 19:56.360]  get those on the show.
[19:56.360 --> 19:58.320]  There is more to this message.
[19:58.320 --> 20:03.680]  And it says, my goal in all of this is to be a solid home grower with aspirations of
[20:03.680 --> 20:08.560]  doing something bigger in the cannabis revolution we are currently in.
[20:08.560 --> 20:13.440]  I am deep in prohibition with no signs of my state coming out soon, but I love this
[20:13.440 --> 20:15.480]  hobby and this plant.
[20:15.480 --> 20:19.680]  If you're in prohibition land and you would like some help working toward legalization,
[20:19.680 --> 20:23.160]  I would recommend finding your local Normal chapter.
[20:23.160 --> 20:27.840]  Normal is the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws, and they will be
[20:27.840 --> 20:32.840]  able to point you in the right direction to get you in cannabis activism.
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.840]  So you said that your main goal is to become a, what is the word you used?
[20:36.840 --> 20:41.480]  A solid home grower, and you've got aspirations of doing something bigger with the cannabis
[20:41.480 --> 20:42.680]  revolution.
[20:42.680 --> 20:47.320]  So if you'd like to be part of that revolution, now is the time to join the battle.
[20:47.320 --> 20:52.520]  I recommend you find your local Normal chapter, find your local cannabis activism chapter,
[20:52.520 --> 20:57.840]  whoever it is, wherever it is, become involved with them however you can, and learn how to
[20:57.840 --> 21:03.920]  make cannabis legal in your area so you can be a bigger part of the cannabis revolution.
[21:03.920 --> 21:08.560]  They wrap up the message with, maybe one day I will be consistent enough to be a test grower
[21:08.560 --> 21:09.560]  for you.
[21:09.560 --> 21:12.980]  And then they sign it with their name, and I am not sure if they want their name said
[21:12.980 --> 21:18.680]  on the show, so I won't reveal their identity, but I will say thank you for the great message.
[21:18.680 --> 21:22.560]  Thank you for sharing your grow of a rise on growdiaries.com.
[21:22.560 --> 21:26.920]  I will definitely save that in my favorites so I can go check that out at least once a
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.600]  week and see what your progress looks like.
[21:29.600 --> 21:33.580]  And hopefully one day you will be able to test some brand new seeds for me.
[21:33.580 --> 21:38.280]  So again, thank you for the great message, and I look forward to seeing your diary on
[21:38.280 --> 21:39.280]  growdiaries.com.
[21:39.280 --> 21:43.400]  All right, I've got one more email for this episode.
[21:43.400 --> 21:46.760]  The last email for today's episode goes just like this.
[21:46.760 --> 21:48.760]  Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[21:48.760 --> 21:52.600]  First off, man, I just want to say thank you for all you do for the cannabis community.
[21:52.600 --> 21:56.680]  Hey, thank you for the recognition, and you are very welcome.
[21:56.720 --> 22:01.440]  The message goes on to say, my name is Kodiak from Oklahoma, and I admittedly am new to
[22:01.440 --> 22:04.800]  finding your podcast, but I can't get enough of it.
[22:04.800 --> 22:06.520]  Well, I'm glad you found me.
[22:06.520 --> 22:07.640]  Welcome to the show.
[22:07.640 --> 22:13.480]  The message goes on to say, your expert insight is invaluable and exactly what I need.
[22:13.480 --> 22:17.480]  I am a longtime smoker, but I am a total newbie to growing.
[22:17.480 --> 22:22.760]  I am nearing the end of my first grow, and I've been fairly pleased with my first attempt.
[22:22.760 --> 22:26.320]  I credit your knowledge for getting me through my first grow.
[22:26.360 --> 22:31.400]  I grow for myself, so my growing goal is just to grow bomb-ass weed.
[22:31.400 --> 22:35.360]  Potency is what I want, so I do have a question for you.
[22:35.360 --> 22:37.720]  All right, so we've got a good foundation here.
[22:37.720 --> 22:40.680]  We've got a new friend named Kodiak from Oklahoma.
[22:40.680 --> 22:42.160]  They are a new grower.
[22:42.160 --> 22:44.560]  They are nearing the end of their first grow.
[22:44.560 --> 22:46.960]  They are fairly pleased with the first grow.
[22:46.960 --> 22:52.160]  They're growing for themselves, and their main goal is potent bomb-ass weed.
[22:52.160 --> 22:53.520]  So they've got a question.
[22:53.520 --> 22:56.520]  The question goes like this.
[22:56.520 --> 23:01.640]  Something I have found to be a little overwhelming as a new grower is definitely nutrients and
[23:01.640 --> 23:03.700]  additives alike.
[23:03.700 --> 23:10.280]  This first go-around, I used Fox Farm Ocean Forest Soil and Fox Farm Bottled Nutrients.
[23:10.280 --> 23:12.120]  I have added nothing else.
[23:12.120 --> 23:14.840]  I use a 4x4x8 Groten.
[23:14.840 --> 23:21.320]  My question is, what would you recommend for a small-time grower to use nutrient-wise going
[23:21.320 --> 23:22.320]  forward?
[23:22.560 --> 23:27.840]  Also, bro, I totally imagine you as a hella busy dude, and I won't sweat in the slightest
[23:27.840 --> 23:29.880]  if you don't respond here.
[23:29.880 --> 23:30.880]  It's all love.
[23:30.880 --> 23:34.400]  I just figured I couldn't hurt to ask for advice from the best.
[23:34.400 --> 23:36.200]  I'm sending good vibes to you.
[23:36.200 --> 23:38.800]  They wrap it up with, take it easy and happy growing.
[23:38.800 --> 23:43.360]  Well, yeah, I am a busy dude, but I've got a podcast, and I love helping people with
[23:43.360 --> 23:46.120]  my podcast, so you are in luck.
[23:46.120 --> 23:48.240]  Let's talk a little bit about your question.
[23:48.240 --> 23:51.960]  You started growing with the Fox Farms Ocean Forest Soil.
[23:51.960 --> 23:53.240]  That is an acceptable soil.
[23:53.240 --> 23:56.920]  Not the most expensive, not the cheapest, not the best, not the worst.
[23:56.920 --> 23:59.920]  That is an acceptable, quality, soilless mix.
[23:59.920 --> 24:00.920]  Nothing wrong with that.
[24:00.920 --> 24:05.520]  Then you used the Fox Farms Bottled Nutrients, probably the trio.
[24:05.520 --> 24:10.880]  You didn't say exactly what you bought, but you are asking what you can use nutrient-wise
[24:10.880 --> 24:12.560]  to go forward.
[24:12.560 --> 24:14.760]  You have got a lot of options.
[24:14.760 --> 24:20.400]  Fortunately, I am writing an episode all about my own personal feed mix.
[24:20.400 --> 24:24.320]  That will take a couple of more weeks before I get it out, but it is coming.
[24:24.320 --> 24:30.920]  In the meantime, let's talk about a couple of things we can add to this Fox Farms mix.
[24:30.920 --> 24:33.960]  I'm going to assume you are using the trio.
[24:33.960 --> 24:35.880]  They've got a basic trio that they sell.
[24:35.880 --> 24:37.160]  Every growth store has it.
[24:37.160 --> 24:42.520]  I think a lot of the hardware stores with a garden center actually offer Fox Farms products
[24:42.520 --> 24:45.620]  at this time, so it is very available.
[24:45.620 --> 24:51.180]  There is nothing wrong with the Fox Farms lineup and I have seen very high quality products
[24:51.180 --> 24:57.820]  come from those nutrients, but I do feel like it is a very entry-level product.
[24:57.820 --> 25:00.820]  Since you are a new grower, that is perfect for you.
[25:00.820 --> 25:06.580]  Fox Farms nutrients are gentle enough that if you do make a small mistake in your feeding,
[25:06.580 --> 25:10.420]  you will not destroy a crop with one simple mistake.
[25:10.420 --> 25:15.300]  They are also very affordable and it is very easy to mix when you've only got three, maybe
[25:15.340 --> 25:17.620]  four or five bottles to deal with.
[25:17.620 --> 25:20.380]  I really feel like there is nothing wrong with that product.
[25:20.380 --> 25:25.000]  I just feel that there are better options once you become a better grower and you understand
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.460]  what to watch for in the plants.
[25:27.460 --> 25:32.980]  For this situation, I am going to assume that you are using the Fox Farms trio as your base
[25:32.980 --> 25:37.220]  and that is the Grow Big, the Tiger Bloom, and what is the other one there?
[25:37.220 --> 25:39.460]  It's the Big Bloom, I believe is what that's called.
[25:39.460 --> 25:46.260]  They also offer three powdered nutrients, Open Sesame, Cha-Ching, and what's the name
[25:46.260 --> 25:47.260]  of that third one?
[25:47.260 --> 25:48.260]  Beastie Blooms.
[25:48.260 --> 25:50.540]  I used Fox Farms a really long time ago.
[25:50.540 --> 25:54.360]  That might have been the first or second product that I attempted to use and I just was not
[25:54.360 --> 25:57.020]  satisfied with it so I moved on.
[25:57.020 --> 26:00.620]  Let's just assume you were using the trio to start with.
[26:00.620 --> 26:04.720]  Perhaps you've got the three powders, maybe you've got some Bush Doctor, but let's talk
[26:04.720 --> 26:10.840]  about a couple of things you can add to your nutrient recipe to enhance your next crop.
[26:10.840 --> 26:15.360]  I always recommend some sort of microbes in your feeding regimen.
[26:15.360 --> 26:18.920]  There are many options when it comes to microbes.
[26:18.920 --> 26:25.000]  Microbe products can be very affordable and microbe products can also be astronomically
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.560]  expensive.
[26:26.560 --> 26:30.960]  Before you select any product for your grow, do a little bit of research on the product
[26:31.960 --> 26:36.760]  Find what it is made from, find out who is making it, and find out how you want to spend
[26:36.760 --> 26:37.920]  your dollars.
[26:37.920 --> 26:42.240]  Then find a product that fits your price range and add that to your mix.
[26:42.240 --> 26:46.480]  You do not have to use the most expensive microbe products you can find.
[26:46.480 --> 26:51.040]  If you can't afford something really expensive, use the microbes you can afford because some
[26:51.040 --> 26:55.040]  microbes are way better than no microbes.
[26:55.040 --> 26:59.620]  Adding beneficial microbes to your nutrient mix will be beneficial in many ways.
[26:59.620 --> 27:04.380]  The first way is that it will simply increase root mass development.
[27:04.380 --> 27:09.500]  You will grow stronger, fatter, thicker, healthier roots in less time.
[27:09.500 --> 27:11.420]  Fatter roots, bigger fruits.
[27:11.420 --> 27:14.420]  More healthy roots, more healthy plants.
[27:14.420 --> 27:20.100]  Adding microbes to our nutrient regimen will also help keep our plants pathogen free.
[27:20.100 --> 27:25.380]  If we have already developed colonies of beneficial fungus in our root zone, there won't be room
[27:25.380 --> 27:26.380]  for pathogens.
[27:26.380 --> 27:30.460]  If anything else tries to come in, those microbes go, nope, this is our turf bro, you're
[27:30.460 --> 27:31.980]  not allowed here.
[27:31.980 --> 27:36.500]  So I would always recommend some sort of a microbe product.
[27:36.500 --> 27:41.500]  Now I keep saying that there are many microbe products available at many different price
[27:41.500 --> 27:42.500]  points.
[27:42.500 --> 27:46.260]  Let me recommend three of my favorite microbes to you.
[27:46.260 --> 27:53.060]  I will recommend Recharge, I will recommend Plus Life, and I will recommend Mammoth Pea.
[27:53.060 --> 27:57.780]  Now those are three equal but very different microbe products and they will all fall at
[27:57.780 --> 28:00.060]  very different price points.
[28:00.060 --> 28:05.260]  You can use any microbe product individually or you can use most of them mixed together.
[28:05.260 --> 28:11.420]  But I definitely recommend you use at least one microbe product at least once a week in
[28:11.420 --> 28:13.300]  your nutrient mix.
[28:13.300 --> 28:16.900]  So the first thing I would add is a quality microbe product.
[28:16.900 --> 28:21.740]  Then I've got a few other recommendations that I would consider adding to that Fox Farms
[28:21.740 --> 28:22.740]  lineup.
[28:23.420 --> 28:26.540]  I would add a product called Shine to my lineup.
[28:26.540 --> 28:28.380]  I think Shine is a great product.
[28:28.380 --> 28:30.460]  It is made by the folks that make Veg Bloom.
[28:30.460 --> 28:32.400]  It is part of the Veg Bloom lineup.
[28:32.400 --> 28:34.820]  It is available from Hydroponic Research.
[28:34.820 --> 28:39.740]  You can find them at hydroponic-research.com.
[28:39.740 --> 28:42.900]  Now let's talk about why I recommend Shine.
[28:42.900 --> 28:46.180]  I think Shine adds to my bud density.
[28:46.180 --> 28:49.880]  I think Shine adds to my trichome density.
[28:49.880 --> 28:53.480]  I think Shine adds to my aroma and flavor.
[28:53.480 --> 28:59.440]  And I also think that if I use Shine early in the flowering phase, it slows down part
[28:59.440 --> 29:01.340]  of my early stretch.
[29:01.340 --> 29:07.600]  So I would add Shine to my mix and you will see an increase in bud density and trichome
[29:07.600 --> 29:12.520]  density and possibly an increase in aromas and flavors.
[29:12.520 --> 29:16.740]  So now we've got microbes making things work a little more quickly in the root zone.
[29:16.740 --> 29:21.020]  Now we've got some Shine beefing up the buds, giving you more trichomes.
[29:21.020 --> 29:24.340]  Something else I would add would be some fulvic acid.
[29:24.340 --> 29:27.800]  And I would recommend Ruby from our friends at New Millennium.
[29:27.800 --> 29:34.340]  And I would use five milliliters of Ruby for every gallon of nutrient solution you mix
[29:34.340 --> 29:37.980]  up every time you feed those plants.
[29:37.980 --> 29:40.820]  Now why do I suggest fulvic acid?
[29:40.820 --> 29:45.220]  We're feeding our plants high quality, expensive nutrients.
[29:45.220 --> 29:52.100]  Fulvic acid essentially makes those nutrients more available and more absorbable by our
[29:52.100 --> 29:53.100]  plants.
[29:53.100 --> 29:54.100]  That is the short explanation.
[29:54.100 --> 29:57.460]  It is sort of like that gas additive that they sell for your car.
[29:57.460 --> 29:59.540]  They say, yeah, that gas works great in your car.
[29:59.540 --> 30:03.380]  It makes the car go vroom, vroom, add a little bit of this shit to the gas and the car will
[30:03.380 --> 30:05.180]  go vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.
[30:05.180 --> 30:07.780]  So that's basically what fulvic acid does.
[30:07.780 --> 30:12.660]  It gives you just a few more RPMs, a couple more horsepower, a little bit more turbo charge.
[30:12.660 --> 30:17.420]  It makes all of those expensive nutrients we are feeding to the plant more absorbable,
[30:17.420 --> 30:19.980]  more available to our plant.
[30:19.980 --> 30:25.420]  So I would suggest or recommend adding some fulvic acid to your feeding regimen.
[30:25.420 --> 30:30.540]  My favorite fulvic acid product is again, Ruby from New Millennium.
[30:30.540 --> 30:35.940]  And I use Ruby at five milliliters per gallon of everything I mix up.
[30:35.940 --> 30:42.400]  If I mix nutrients, I put five milliliters of Ruby in every gallon, every time I feed.
[30:43.140 --> 30:47.320]  Now at this point with this many new additives, we have kind of turbo charged our plants.
[30:47.320 --> 30:49.880]  We need to pay attention to CalMag.
[30:49.880 --> 30:52.160]  Are you getting a CalMag deficiency?
[30:52.160 --> 30:58.760]  If you don't have a CalMag product, this may be the time to consider adding CalMag to your lineup.
[30:58.760 --> 31:02.240]  Do you know what a CalMag deficiency looks like?
[31:02.240 --> 31:08.280]  Because we are currently not adding any calcium or magnesium supplements to these plants with
[31:08.280 --> 31:10.220]  this current nutrient feed.
[31:10.220 --> 31:16.660]  So with these extra additives we just put in the mix, we may need to watch for a CalMag deficiency.
[31:16.660 --> 31:21.380]  So before we start boosting up our nutrients, I recommend you find the chart on the internet
[31:21.380 --> 31:27.940]  that shows the cannabis leaf and all of the nutrient symptoms of deficiencies and toxicities.
[31:27.940 --> 31:34.180]  It will show you a cannabis leaf and it will say nitrogen deficiency or toxicity, calcium
[31:34.180 --> 31:37.980]  toxicity or deficiency, and it will show you what they look like.
[31:37.980 --> 31:41.420]  Get a good idea of what the CalMag deficiency looks like.
[31:41.420 --> 31:44.700]  Get a good idea of what the nitrogen deficiency looks like.
[31:44.700 --> 31:49.260]  Get a good idea of what phosphorus and potassium deficiencies look like.
[31:49.260 --> 31:51.740]  That way when those things come up, we know how to adjust.
[31:51.740 --> 31:54.340]  But right now we're focusing on CalMag.
[31:54.340 --> 31:58.900]  Learn what a CalMag deficiency looks like and think about if it's time to start adding
[31:58.900 --> 32:01.620]  CalMag to your nutrient regimen.
[32:01.620 --> 32:06.420]  So we've added some microbes, we've added some shine, we put some fulvic acid in there.
[32:06.420 --> 32:10.140]  We may need some CalMag now that we're going so hard with these plants, we're turbocharging
[32:10.140 --> 32:11.380]  them.
[32:11.380 --> 32:13.740]  What can we possibly do next?
[32:13.740 --> 32:19.580]  At this point, I would recommend a product called Winter Frost from New Millennium.
[32:19.580 --> 32:24.940]  Winter Frost is used right at the end of the flowering phase, just before flush.
[32:24.940 --> 32:31.940]  I feel like if you use Winter Frost and shine together, you will see tremendous results.
[32:32.020 --> 32:37.420]  You have to be careful not to burn your plants when you are adding this many additives to
[32:37.420 --> 32:38.580]  your recipe.
[32:38.580 --> 32:40.940]  I recommend that you start slowly.
[32:40.940 --> 32:45.860]  The first time you introduce Winter Frost to your feed mix, maybe go half strength and
[32:45.860 --> 32:47.020]  see what it does.
[32:47.020 --> 32:48.140]  Does it burn the plants?
[32:48.140 --> 32:49.540]  Did you notice anything?
[32:49.540 --> 32:55.580]  If it didn't have any adverse effects to the plants, increase the dosage on the next feed.
[32:55.580 --> 33:00.540]  Make sure you keep notes of what you are feeding your plants so that you know how much you
[33:00.540 --> 33:03.580]  fed it and how the plant responded.
[33:03.580 --> 33:07.420]  Start lightly, maybe a quarter, maybe 50% of the recommended dosage.
[33:07.420 --> 33:08.420]  Feed it that.
[33:08.420 --> 33:09.620]  See how the plant responds.
[33:09.620 --> 33:14.060]  Next time, feed it more if you want to, feed it less if you need to, but don't go full
[33:14.060 --> 33:19.740]  strength right away when you are adding this many additives to your nutrient solution.
[33:19.740 --> 33:23.540]  I've still got a couple of things I'd like to recommend, so let's keep moving.
[33:23.540 --> 33:28.780]  At this point, I may suggest adding some enzymes to your nutrient mix.
[33:28.780 --> 33:33.260]  Enzymes work with the microbes, enzymes work with the fulvic acid, and they help to make
[33:33.260 --> 33:38.080]  all of the nutrients more available to the plants.
[33:38.080 --> 33:42.780]  Enzymes will also work with the microbes and the fulvic acid to keep the plants pathogen
[33:42.780 --> 33:43.780]  free.
[33:43.780 --> 33:49.300]  So I would recommend adding an enzymatic product to your nutrient mix.
[33:49.300 --> 33:54.140]  Now the next product is just something that I personally add to my personal grows because
[33:54.140 --> 33:57.500]  I believe it adds aroma and flavor.
[33:57.500 --> 34:03.060]  I really think this product brings out the skunky, funky, dirty, cushy aromas, and the
[34:03.060 --> 34:06.540]  product I am talking about is called Liquid Karma.
[34:06.540 --> 34:08.060]  Liquid Karma is from Botanicare.
[34:08.060 --> 34:10.060]  It is very affordable.
[34:10.060 --> 34:16.100]  It is more of a supplement, but it is a product that I add for aroma and flavor and possibly
[34:16.100 --> 34:18.580]  a little bit of bud density.
[34:18.580 --> 34:19.780]  I don't know if I'm crazy.
[34:19.780 --> 34:21.400]  I don't know if I'm making it up.
[34:21.400 --> 34:27.180]  It could possibly be a placebo effect, but I do feel that when I use Liquid Karma, that
[34:27.220 --> 34:31.900]  my buds smell just a little bit stinkier than when I don't use it.
[34:31.900 --> 34:35.600]  So that is the last specific product I'm going to recommend.
[34:35.600 --> 34:41.780]  You may also want to add a bloom booster to your regimen, but I don't have a specific
[34:41.780 --> 34:43.740]  bloom booster recommendation.
[34:43.740 --> 34:46.980]  There are countless options available for bloom boosters.
[34:46.980 --> 34:51.960]  Again, stay tuned to the show because in the very near future, I am going to do a very
[34:51.960 --> 34:59.000]  detailed episode, possibly two episodes on my very specific nutrient recipe and how
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.320]  I mix it.
[35:00.320 --> 35:01.320]  So let's recap.
[35:01.320 --> 35:06.200]  I think I said I would add microbes because microbes will make the roots grow faster and
[35:06.200 --> 35:07.560]  keep pathogens away.
[35:07.560 --> 35:12.140]  Then I would add some shine because shine is going to give us more trichomes and more
[35:12.140 --> 35:16.940]  bud density, and who doesn't like denser trichome-covered buds?
[35:16.940 --> 35:21.540]  Then I would add some fulvic acid to make all of those nutrients better available to
[35:21.540 --> 35:22.700]  the plants.
[35:22.700 --> 35:25.740]  At this point, we may need some CalMag.
[35:25.740 --> 35:31.100]  Then I got a little bit random and I went with some winter frost, some Liquid Karma,
[35:31.100 --> 35:35.200]  some enzymes, and possibly a bloom booster.
[35:35.200 --> 35:39.060]  So I hope I have opened your mind, given you a few options of things you can add to your
[35:39.060 --> 35:40.380]  Fox Farms lineup.
[35:40.380 --> 35:43.080]  Again, any of those products will be beneficial.
[35:43.080 --> 35:47.120]  A couple of them in conjunction with each other will really do a great job.
[35:47.120 --> 35:52.280]  I would always recommend some fulvic acid because you're already paying for the nutrients.
[35:52.280 --> 35:58.800]  Why not add that fulvic acid to actually make all of the nutrients available to the plants?
[35:58.800 --> 36:02.480]  Then once we've got the basic nutrition covered, that's when we want to start adding things
[36:02.480 --> 36:07.480]  to give us beefier, bulkier plants with more stank and more resin.
[36:07.480 --> 36:12.160]  That's when we move in to the products like shine, the winter frost, and then eventually
[36:12.240 --> 36:14.840]  we end with bloom boosters.
[36:14.840 --> 36:16.360]  So I hope I have inspired you.
[36:16.360 --> 36:18.360]  I hope I did not overwhelm you.
[36:18.360 --> 36:22.800]  If you want to learn more about nutrients and you want to learn exactly what I am mixing,
[36:22.800 --> 36:25.320]  stay tuned because I like to keep teasing it.
[36:25.320 --> 36:31.360]  But in a few episodes, I'm going to put out a very detailed episode on exactly what I
[36:31.360 --> 36:34.720]  feed and how I feed my plants.
[36:34.720 --> 36:38.240]  I want to thank my new friend, Kodiak in Oklahoma, for the great email.
[36:38.240 --> 36:42.680]  If anybody else out there has a cannabis cultivation or cannabis culture question,
[36:42.680 --> 36:43.840]  I would love to hear from you.
[36:43.840 --> 36:48.840]  My email address is growfromyourheart.com.

[37:46.660 --> 37:50.020]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy Mason Pitt.
[37:50.020 --> 37:53.500]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[37:55.500 --> 37:58.500]  She came to my high school.
[37:58.500 --> 38:01.500]  She caused quite a stir.
[38:01.900 --> 38:07.900]  All the kids at big time high wanted to be just like her.
[38:07.900 --> 38:13.900]  Make lots of money till you grow old.
[38:13.900 --> 38:18.900]  Sell your diamond decently for 24 grams of gold.
[38:18.900 --> 38:23.900]  She was a porno star.
[38:24.900 --> 38:29.900]  She drove a fast, fast car.
[38:31.900 --> 38:35.900]  Kept all her money in a plastic bag.
[38:44.970 --> 38:47.970]  He used to teach at my high school.
[38:47.970 --> 38:50.970]  He caused quite an uproar.
[38:50.970 --> 38:53.970]  With diamonds and pearls and a ring on each finger.
[38:53.970 --> 38:56.970]  And a whole lot more.
[38:56.970 --> 39:02.970]  None of us raised our hand to ask him why.
[39:02.970 --> 39:05.970]  Because it was a hell of a chore.
[39:06.370 --> 39:12.370]  He was a porno star.
[39:13.370 --> 39:21.880]  He drove a fast, fast car.
[39:21.880 --> 39:32.210]  He put it in the journal of science.
[39:32.210 --> 39:35.210]  And yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:35.210 --> 39:38.480]  Da da da da.
[39:38.480 --> 39:40.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:40.480 --> 39:42.480]  Da da da da.
[39:42.480 --> 39:48.760]  Da da da da.
[39:48.760 --> 39:50.760]  Da da da da.
[39:51.160 --> 41:59.140]  They were the topic that made her rock so great.
[41:59.140 --> 42:02.140]  Went to the preacher to save their souls.
[42:02.140 --> 42:05.140]  And he said it's not too late.
[42:05.140 --> 42:11.140]  When we asked them about their car and their finest day.
[42:11.140 --> 42:14.140]  They said we like who we are.
[42:14.140 --> 42:16.140]  And we're feeling great.
[42:16.140 --> 42:21.140]  They were a porno star.
[42:21.540 --> 42:39.870]  He drove a fast, fast car.
[42:39.870 --> 42:47.440]  And yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:47.440 --> 42:49.440]  Da da da da.
[42:49.440 --> 42:51.440]  Da da da da.
[42:51.440 --> 42:54.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:54.440 --> 42:56.440]  Da da da da.
[42:56.440 --> 42:58.440]  Da da da da.
[42:58.440 --> 43:01.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:49.300 --> 43:51.300]  People are people.
[43:51.300 --> 43:53.300]  I'm not a judge.
[43:53.700 --> 43:55.700]  People are people.
[43:55.700 --> 43:57.700]  And I'm not a judge.
[43:57.700 --> 43:59.700]  People are people.
[43:59.700 --> 44:00.700]  I'm not a judge.
[44:00.700 --> 44:02.700]  I'm not a judge.
[44:02.700 --> 44:04.700]  I'm not a judge.
[44:04.700 --> 44:06.700]  People are people.
[44:06.700 --> 44:08.700]  And I'm not a judge.
[44:08.700 --> 44:10.700]  People are people.
[44:10.700 --> 44:12.700]  And I'm not a judge.
[44:12.700 --> 44:14.700]  I'm not a judge.
[44:14.700 --> 44:16.060]  I'm not a judge.
