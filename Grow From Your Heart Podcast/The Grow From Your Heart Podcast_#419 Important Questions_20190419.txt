[00:43.220 --> 00:45.220]  I appreciate the boost. Yeah, man
[00:45.220 --> 00:48.280]  We like to start off the podcast by talking about what we are smoking
[00:48.580 --> 00:52.380]  Which one should we tell them about that? We smoked we've been sitting here dabbing for quite a while
[00:52.380 --> 00:57.500]  We've had it quite a smorgasbord. We are some spoiled brats. We're pushing a holiday up here in a minute
[00:57.500 --> 01:02.580]  We don't want to make anybody a prohibition land cry or let's do we smoked some blackberry
[01:02.980 --> 01:09.560]  Banana cush ambrosia. That was the way tasty. We did a couple of dabs of grape cola batter
[01:09.700 --> 01:14.020]  That was quite tasty that just it just tastes like grape Jolly Rancher
[01:14.020 --> 01:16.700]  And I think I I'll agree with the grape Jolly Ranchers
[01:17.260 --> 01:23.900]  So good and then I think my favorite was the Malibu pure kush batter from apothecary farms
[01:23.900 --> 01:27.080]  That's got that just straight og. Tahoe kush sort of a flavor
[01:27.660 --> 01:31.940]  And we may have dabbed a couple of others, but those are the ones that I'd oh we did hit the Tropicana cookies
[01:32.260 --> 01:37.060]  That was the grapefruit really fruity really tropical fruit one may have been the last one we hit
[01:37.060 --> 01:39.420]  So we have been taking quite a few dabs over here
[01:39.420 --> 01:46.020]  We're getting into a little bit of a pre 420 celebration in Colorado 420 pretty much starts the weekend before 24
[01:46.180 --> 01:47.180]  420
[01:47.180 --> 01:52.880]  Weekend before 420. I'm not gonna edit that we're just gonna leave that there cuz that was that's real 420 talk right there
[01:53.260 --> 01:58.780]  But it starts early it starts the weekend before 420 then we have 420 is the actual weekend holiday this year
[01:58.780 --> 02:02.820]  It happens to actually be on a weekend. I'm sure that will continue into Monday and Tuesday
[02:02.820 --> 02:07.300]  We will see some smoke celebrations and parties it will linger people are still in town having a good time
[02:07.300 --> 02:14.220]  But we are starting early all of the local dispensaries are having sales, and I am definitely taking advantage of those sales
[02:14.700 --> 02:17.340]  I've got some green dot on the table. It is delicious
[02:17.340 --> 02:24.460]  I have got this this for TZ Mo the label says it is crescendo and HSB to the best of my knowledge that is hash
[02:25.340 --> 02:29.700]  man hash bar is what I think that stands for and the package here says
[02:30.260 --> 02:33.140]  Octane and dumpster is the description on the flavor
[02:33.260 --> 02:33.740]  Yeah
[02:33.740 --> 02:39.220]  So I've had a lot of fun shopping for concentrates the past few days everywhere has got great sales a lot of the brands
[02:39.220 --> 02:42.120]  Been holding back some of their their hit stuff for this week
[02:42.120 --> 02:45.500]  So it's been fun going out and visiting dispensaries and seeing what's available
[02:45.820 --> 02:51.140]  Recreational and medical shops have a bunch of great stuff right now. It's been really nice shelves are loaded up across the state
[02:51.140 --> 02:55.060]  No, I really like green dots new packaging. I can alive. It's just
[02:55.620 --> 03:02.300]  Aesthetically a pleasing it looks nice. I really like the way they are putting the cross or the blend because it's not really a cross
[03:02.300 --> 03:04.820]  They didn't breed it, but they took two strains on this one
[03:04.820 --> 03:08.660]  It says that they put a chem dog number four and star dog in here together
[03:08.660 --> 03:13.540]  And the description is guava juice and watermelon will dab some of that one in a minute
[03:13.540 --> 03:17.980]  That's the copper can later always one of my favorites on this one. They describe it as
[03:18.820 --> 03:22.780]  Tropical fruit cocktail. This is the Mai Tai at sunset sherbet purple punch
[03:23.460 --> 03:26.580]  Some delicious concentrates Mike's face is going. Hey, why didn't we smoke?
[03:26.580 --> 03:30.700]  So's none of this information was available at what a year ago
[03:31.180 --> 03:33.540]  You wouldn't get this on there's ago two years ago
[03:33.540 --> 03:35.420]  You wouldn't you wouldn't get this on the packaging
[03:35.420 --> 03:40.500]  It certainly wasn't standard and now it's it's becoming commonplace and I just love it and on the back
[03:40.500 --> 03:43.260]  We've got the lab testing and all the other requirements here. So
[03:44.220 --> 03:46.220]  67% on that one
[03:46.340 --> 03:50.620]  69% on this one the stuff from apothecary. We've got different type of labeling
[03:50.620 --> 03:55.380]  Yeah, I'm loving all of the descriptions and all the information what I don't like these guys do it
[03:55.380 --> 03:59.980]  Okay, green dot and apothecary they do a really good job. They give you a jar with concentrates in it
[03:59.980 --> 04:04.940]  there are some companies that give you way too much stuff a box with a little feel for the
[04:05.140 --> 04:10.300]  Canadians a little wrapper with a little like tissue paper with a little sticker in there with the
[04:11.220 --> 04:14.140]  Bags. Oh, we're not even gonna call out any names
[04:14.140 --> 04:18.780]  It was I actually told them I hated the fuzzy bags and they they took my advice and they stopped using it
[04:18.780 --> 04:24.380]  Oh good the the jar came in a like a little pouch sort of like Crown Royal comes
[04:24.380 --> 04:27.020]  That's what the bag the inside of the bag
[04:27.260 --> 04:28.500]  This
[04:28.500 --> 04:35.780]  Can like super fuzzy and linty and so when you pull your jar concentrate out it was like cool now the jars fuzzy
[04:35.780 --> 04:37.780]  This is not at all
[04:37.860 --> 04:41.300]  Appealing it looked like the jar had just stringy hairs hanging off of it
[04:41.300 --> 04:46.340]  It was pretty unappealing once you opened it, but I told them I said, hey, I love your absolutely love your concentrates
[04:46.340 --> 04:50.660]  But this sucks and I sent them a picture. I was like, this is what it came out of the package looking like
[04:50.660 --> 04:52.700]  This is very appealing. I was like, I know what's in here
[04:52.700 --> 04:56.860]  So I know this is fire and I know that it should be represented better and they're like, oh that is terrible
[04:56.860 --> 05:00.380]  And they stopped doing it. They actually messaged me and said thank you. I was polite about it
[05:00.380 --> 05:04.460]  I was like this sucks cuz you constructive criticism fucking hell. Yes, I take it as well
[05:04.460 --> 05:10.300]  Um before we go too far, I owe a few people some shout outs for patreon shout out shout out time

[07:09.540 --> 07:12.660]  That was that was a little content does not come easy folks
[07:12.860 --> 07:16.460]  Yeah, it's fun, but it does take a little bit to put all that out
[07:16.460 --> 07:22.940]  I really wanted to push it up and catch up and get the episode 420 by 420 and so far dude success
[07:22.940 --> 07:27.100]  We're you're on track for sure, man. You can't stop me now. We'll get you there. We're gonna do it, bro
[07:27.100 --> 07:29.100]  Thanks for coming for 419. I do appreciate that
[07:29.620 --> 07:34.860]  In this episode, I've got an email from a listener. It is long. There are several questions
[07:34.900 --> 07:36.460]  We are going to read
[07:36.460 --> 07:41.260]  the intro and we will go through the list of questions and then when I feel like the podcast has gotten
[07:41.580 --> 07:44.180]  Satisfactory and my voice burns out and I've heard enough of Mike
[07:44.180 --> 07:47.540]  We're going to wrap up this email and we may continue it in a future episode
[07:48.860 --> 07:50.420]  but two-parter
[07:50.420 --> 07:51.620]  maybe
[07:51.620 --> 07:57.740]  419 and 421 maybe a three-parter maybe a one-parter. It's a hell of a he's got a stack of pages over here
[07:57.740 --> 08:01.180]  But um, there were images in here that I took out and it's large font
[08:01.180 --> 08:07.020]  So it made look like more message than it actually is now that I'm kind of unstacking the page multiple paragraphs
[08:07.020 --> 08:12.220]  Yes, we got some some serious question and story time ahead of us. Let's dive in
[08:12.220 --> 08:14.380]  You know what? I yeah, I was gonna say I bet we could get more done
[08:14.380 --> 08:18.500]  If we quit talking about how many pages there are and if we do read the email
[08:18.500 --> 08:23.820]  All right, you guys if anybody wants to send me an email my email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[08:23.820 --> 08:27.780]  I'd love to hear from you. This email goes a lot like this
[08:28.300 --> 08:30.740]  Rasta Jeff. I hope this email finds you well
[08:30.740 --> 08:34.140]  I promised pictures of my arise grow a number of months ago
[08:34.220 --> 08:36.820]  But I haven't had the time to put together this email
[08:36.820 --> 08:41.900]  I've been listening to the podcast and tuning into you on Instagram live for almost two years
[08:42.140 --> 08:48.700]  I've also been a patron of your podcast on patreon for the past six months or so as well. Thank you, man
[08:48.700 --> 08:52.180]  Yeah, man. Thanks a lot for all the patreon support. I hope I've given you a shout out
[08:52.180 --> 08:54.820]  You know what? I see your name up here and I have dude. Thank you for all the support
[08:54.820 --> 09:01.180]  I definitely know your name. Where am I? Here? I am. Thank you for all the high quality knowledge you spread on a daily basis
[09:01.180 --> 09:06.780]  You're very welcome, dude. I'm glad you were improving your garden with my knowledge. I greatly appreciate what you do and possibly
[09:07.460 --> 09:09.460]  More importantly how you do it
[09:09.940 --> 09:11.700]  You're very welcome to that means a lot to me
[09:11.700 --> 09:16.820]  Also, then he says my main reason for writing is to share pictures from my arise grow a few months back
[09:17.100 --> 09:23.180]  But I also have a number of questions and suggestions that I've thought of while listening to you and the DGC
[09:23.260 --> 09:25.660]  So I will dump a lot of those at the end
[09:25.900 --> 09:31.540]  First the pictures and some general information about my grow then he includes several
[09:31.940 --> 09:37.140]  Beautiful pictures of my strain arise you did a wonderful job. We'll talk about that more privately
[09:37.140 --> 09:41.500]  I can't show your pictures here. So I don't want to talk too much about them and abandon the people that are listening
[09:41.540 --> 09:48.220]  So let's keep going forward. He talks about his grow. He's growing in a 27 by 27 by 63 inch tent
[09:48.300 --> 09:54.260]  So this tall three feet tall nearly by three feet wide. I'm assuming notes three feet by three feet
[09:54.980 --> 09:59.540]  Square by 63. What's that five feet tall Mike 63 inches five feet ish
[09:59.980 --> 10:01.980]  Then he's got an HLG
[10:02.220 --> 10:08.700]  135 a horticultural lighting group 135 LED in there. That sounds like enough light seven gallon air pots
[10:09.620 --> 10:16.220]  7030 mix of Fox Farms Ocean Forest and perlite sounds like you're doing a great job running the Fox Farms trio with recharge
[10:16.580 --> 10:21.180]  We could do more with the nutrients. We could give you a boost in there, but the recharge is helping you out
[10:21.180 --> 10:25.380]  We may add a few things in the future. If you listen, I've mixed up so much Fox Farms
[10:25.380 --> 10:27.980]  It's it's not a bad soil to use if you that's what you're going for
[10:27.980 --> 10:31.820]  Oh, he's got the soil, but he's using the the Fox Farms trio the three bottles for feeding
[10:31.820 --> 10:33.380]  We could definitely do a little better than that
[10:33.380 --> 10:37.540]  I'm not sure but we can we can move forward from there. That is a good starter setup
[10:37.540 --> 10:39.460]  But we can improve from there. You're off to a great start
[10:39.460 --> 10:44.540]  He said this was my third photo run my first run with your genetics. I've also ran autos twice
[10:44.980 --> 10:47.540]  Man, I hope every girl you get a little bit better
[10:47.540 --> 10:52.900]  He says overall I would rate it a solid seven out of ten and as long as you're satisfied
[10:52.900 --> 10:55.580]  We are happy with you. He says it was the best crop
[10:55.580 --> 10:58.380]  I've had to date the buds looked great coming off the plant
[10:58.380 --> 11:03.700]  But the temps and humidity were a bit out of whack during dry and cure. Yeah, that is always a struggle
[11:03.700 --> 11:08.700]  He says it left the buds a little crispier than I would prefer as well as lowering overall humidity
[11:09.060 --> 11:15.460]  Quality from a solid eight overall bud quality from a solid eight borderline nine to a solid seven
[11:15.460 --> 11:20.500]  So you went from an eight and a half ish down to a seven during the drying cure process. That's not a bad drop
[11:20.620 --> 11:25.500]  Yeah, what how many grows in you see three? This is the third grow. That's not great. That's not even I
[11:26.220 --> 11:29.980]  mean you might notice it because it's you and it's yours and you love it, but
[11:31.060 --> 11:37.140]  Like the friend that you smoke out with it isn't couldn't tell the difference and as long as it's doing what you need
[11:37.700 --> 11:38.980]  Additionally killer. Yeah
[11:38.980 --> 11:39.300]  Yeah
[11:39.300 --> 11:40.660]  and you're only gonna get better and
[11:40.660 --> 11:45.940]  Manna eight out of a ten and then you made it a seven with your track. Here's a pain in the ass and it's so
[11:46.340 --> 11:50.140]  Tricky and there's so many little ins and outs and this guy's probably got a job
[11:50.140 --> 11:54.460]  He can't sit there all day like we do and stare at the jars and hope it's time to open them
[11:54.460 --> 11:57.700]  He can't do that kind of stuff probably and that becomes that's when it really gets
[11:57.700 --> 12:02.580]  You know a couple of tricks to if you want to bring some of that moisture content back and not have it taste like
[12:02.580 --> 12:07.300]  Oh, we've talked a lot about that on the podcast the drying and curing episode would really help this guy out
[12:07.860 --> 12:10.180]  Should we press pause and find out what number that is?
[12:10.220 --> 12:14.900]  Hey Mike check on your phone and find out what drying and curing is you keep reading? I will check the thank you, buddy
[12:15.020 --> 12:18.860]  Pull that shit up Jamie. That's my Joe Rogan reference. All right, we're gonna keep moving here
[12:18.860 --> 12:23.180]  Ah, it goes on it says they smoked well and everyone that I shared with came back for more
[12:23.180 --> 12:25.980]  So just like Mike said your people are gonna enjoy it
[12:25.980 --> 12:31.180]  I like to smoke while taking care of mundane household chores, and this was a great strain just for that
[12:32.220 --> 12:35.220]  Yeah, I've rise is fucking great for chores. I agree with that
[12:35.380 --> 12:36.660]  I
[12:36.660 --> 12:40.580]  Keep looking at Mike thinking he might have the episode number. I think I know the number but I don't want to be wrong
[12:41.060 --> 12:44.700]  The original one was 36. Oh, no, there's a much more reason
[12:44.700 --> 12:49.020]  There's a much more recent one, but I've got to go to the episode list and scroll down
[12:49.140 --> 12:52.020]  It's gonna be in the 380s or 390s
[12:52.820 --> 12:58.260]  Based off of your arise podcast episode. I believe I had one of the sweet Island skunk phenotypes
[12:58.260 --> 12:58.580]  All right
[12:58.580 --> 13:03.060]  You got some sweet tropical flavors probably kind of taller not as dense of buds as some of the other phenotypes
[13:03.380 --> 13:05.740]  Would have liked to fill out the net a little better
[13:05.740 --> 13:08.180]  But this was my first time working with this cultivar
[13:08.180 --> 13:11.840]  So I erred on the side of caution and flipped a little earlier than I should have
[13:12.460 --> 13:15.380]  The dry and cure episode is 391
[13:16.060 --> 13:20.900]  391 there you go. 390 190 drying and curing 391
[13:21.900 --> 13:24.940]  You've probably heard it, but I just want to make sure that you know that it is available
[13:25.140 --> 13:29.940]  So he says that he flipped a little bit early, but I mean, I'd rather you flip a little early than a little bit
[13:30.540 --> 13:32.300]  Yeah, he said for my next run
[13:32.300 --> 13:35.860]  I've got a pack a five pack of pineapple wine and a five pack of your hellfire
[13:35.940 --> 13:40.780]  Oh gee, that's gonna be a fun grow the hellfire. Oh gee will get a little stretchy on you
[13:40.780 --> 13:45.700]  The pineapple one will keep up the pineapple one will stay tighter during the grow
[13:45.700 --> 13:51.420]  But it'll make bigger buds that the hellfire is gonna stretch a little bit and make a bunch of like golf ball sized rocks on
[13:51.420 --> 13:55.340]  It's gonna be a completely different type of grow. So be prepared for two different dance partners
[13:55.340 --> 13:57.420]  It's gonna be a little bit of work, but it will be fun
[13:57.620 --> 14:00.900]  Don't worry too much it goes on and say gonna pop all of each
[14:01.540 --> 14:06.900]  Looking to grow two plants in my new 36 by 48 inch tent and I've got a friend in Vermont
[14:06.900 --> 14:12.340]  I start plants indoor for he'll take any additional females. I have leftover after sexing man
[14:12.340 --> 14:16.260]  It sounds like you've got a solid game plan. Mm-hmm. I like the pictures of the arise
[14:16.260 --> 14:20.100]  I can't wait to see pictures of the pineapple wine and hellfire. Oh gee
[14:20.780 --> 14:26.580]  Now there is more to the email. He's off to a great start. It says questions and suggestions
[14:26.580 --> 14:31.140]  I like the way he broke down this message. Here's where it gets gets to the questions and suggestions
[14:31.300 --> 14:37.220]  I've been considering using some vacation time in the future to travel to one of the larger cannabis industry events
[14:37.460 --> 14:40.500]  Events similar to the endo Expo or the DGC Cup
[14:40.680 --> 14:47.160]  What are some of your favorite event events you've been to over the years and what would you suggest for someone not in the industry?
[14:47.340 --> 14:51.540]  Being able to consume on premises would be one of the necessary caveats
[14:51.900 --> 14:57.780]  Would it be different for someone that is only a consumer and not a grower let's talk about that one for a second
[14:57.780 --> 15:00.380]  Um, I would recommend the dude grows cup
[15:00.460 --> 15:05.000]  It's the only event that I would recommend at this point is the DGC Cup
[15:05.340 --> 15:11.860]  Stay tuned to this podcast and the dude grows cup. There may be another event being talked about right now
[15:11.860 --> 15:18.300]  It's being talked about by their donors. That's in Colorado. There are a couple events around the country like Seattle's hemp fest
[15:19.300 --> 15:25.540]  There's a massive smoke out of that over the 420 weekend in Vancouver like clearly you missed it for this year
[15:26.180 --> 15:31.100]  But you might be able to set up tickets and have a book a badass time for next year
[15:31.100 --> 15:36.260]  The Emerald Cup seems to be a good time. Some people don't seem to have a good time. Some people say it's amazing
[15:37.420 --> 15:39.420]  consumption at the event is
[15:39.460 --> 15:41.180]  pretty rare
[15:41.180 --> 15:43.460]  In the legal cannabis space right now
[15:43.780 --> 15:47.460]  The the whole world is freaked out about more than three people getting
[15:47.900 --> 15:51.220]  getting together and smoking pot at the same time and so
[15:51.940 --> 15:59.460]  Finding a legal space where a large cannabis event with a real venue, you know where you can get some good vending some food
[16:00.380 --> 16:03.400]  Lots of different booths for different parts of the industry
[16:04.340 --> 16:09.140]  All the little chachki shit that comes with an event like that just to have that space and consumption
[16:09.980 --> 16:16.540]  There's not a lot of good options right now, Michigan is probably one of your best places for that, Oregon, Washington, Michigan
[16:17.380 --> 16:25.620]  Oklahoma, those are probably some of your best bets the places, California. They changed their rules recently and they have really limited the
[16:26.940 --> 16:29.860]  Recreational smoking at events Colorado basically shut it down
[16:29.860 --> 16:34.580]  You need to have a private party sort of a thing the way we kind of are able to do it here
[16:34.580 --> 16:37.860]  There are very few venues that are known to let us have
[16:38.460 --> 16:43.780]  Consumption events we have to have a private party kind of a thing where we invite you you have to be on a list
[16:43.780 --> 16:48.980]  It is done very carefully to where it's not open to the public so to speak. So there are some loopholes
[16:49.860 --> 16:52.940]  If you want to go to an event where you can consume I would say
[16:53.260 --> 16:58.700]  Come to the dude grows cup also pay attention for an event that may happen in July. I can't make any promises
[16:58.700 --> 17:00.860]  I'm trying to make this happen. We are trying to make it happen
[17:00.860 --> 17:05.660]  It's a bunch of stoners talking about it at this point, but I'll see if I can dab these guys into some motivation
[17:05.660 --> 17:09.800]  We'll make that happen Michigan always puts on a great party. Michigan has a great time
[17:10.460 --> 17:12.700]  Hempfest in Seattle the Emerald Cup
[17:12.740 --> 17:18.460]  Those are events where you can consume and you can meet a lot of great people a lot of the high times events are great
[17:18.460 --> 17:23.860]  But they aren't in some states. They aren't allowed to consume unless you're a medical smoker unless you're in certain areas
[17:23.860 --> 17:26.780]  So the high times events are fun chalice is fun
[17:26.780 --> 17:27.940]  Those events are great
[17:27.940 --> 17:33.400]  But make sure you research if you can consume before you buy your tickets to go research the event before you book
[17:33.420 --> 17:35.020]  yes, and
[17:35.020 --> 17:38.980]  Always keep in mind that sometimes these events are required to move venues
[17:39.100 --> 17:43.060]  Sometimes these events are canceled at the last minute. Don't hate on
[17:43.620 --> 17:49.220]  The promoter the organizer they do everything that they can to make these events happen
[17:49.220 --> 17:53.920]  Sometimes it's a struggle the last minute the city says, you know what one of our guys just threw a hissy fit
[17:53.920 --> 17:59.420]  We're gonna change our mind on you last minute. Oh uncle Bob back there through a fit the whole family reunion is over
[17:59.420 --> 18:03.960]  Sorry, you don't get to go Mike. Let's stay on track a little bit because this guy sent us a long email
[18:03.960 --> 18:05.960]  I would like to get through most of it
[18:06.000 --> 18:12.520]  this next paragraph says I was thinking an episode on what to expect when entering a grow contest or throwdown would be
[18:12.600 --> 18:15.920]  Informative for anyone thinking about dipping their toes into that water
[18:17.560 --> 18:23.600]  Having just come from a grow off or a friendly community smoke grow off type of event I
[18:24.320 --> 18:26.720]  Feel a lot of what contributed to
[18:27.440 --> 18:33.700]  Judging there was mostly flavor when you've got a group of people judging an amount of product
[18:33.700 --> 18:38.760]  Which is there were 50 entries if I had you smoke one ripoff of 50 entries
[18:38.760 --> 18:41.000]  Would you be able to tell me the difference after number 22?
[18:41.720 --> 18:45.800]  It's after a certain point. You're just baked and it's all flavors the right distinction
[18:45.800 --> 18:52.160]  So what I think one this cup was mostly based on flavor. Yes. It's got a burn properly
[18:52.160 --> 18:55.440]  Yes, it's got a look good in the jar. It's got to have all the proper
[18:56.200 --> 19:02.080]  Characteristics when you're in a competition, they all bring tricones. They all have bag appeal. They're all trimmed properly
[19:02.640 --> 19:04.640]  They're all dried and cured beautifully
[19:04.640 --> 19:11.480]  So what it's just the very subtle nuances if you've got those very beautiful flavors if it burns perfectly
[19:11.480 --> 19:14.480]  Those are the things it's got to be 100% perfection
[19:14.480 --> 19:20.440]  So he said what to expect when entering as anyone thinking about dipping their toes in you've got to do everything
[19:20.880 --> 19:26.040]  Perfectly trim it to where it looks like it is on the cover of a magazine that I can't be stressed enough
[19:26.400 --> 19:31.400]  Trim your fucking herb. Yeah ugly herb. I look right past it. I go. They were too lazy to trim it properly
[19:31.400 --> 19:33.720]  They probably didn't do the rest of the process properly
[19:33.720 --> 19:37.800]  It probably tastes like shit because there's a lot of chlorophyll in it because look at all that leaf material
[19:37.800 --> 19:40.280]  Yeah, it's a turn-off right away. So trim it properly
[19:40.880 --> 19:45.680]  Dry it and cure it a lot of product looked really good. You went to smoke it. It was too damp
[19:45.680 --> 19:48.720]  It was too dry. It just wasn't right. You could tell that it was quick dried
[19:48.720 --> 19:50.720]  It just burned up a little bit weird
[19:51.760 --> 19:53.160]  flush
[19:53.160 --> 19:57.200]  Flush before harvest flushing is free. Please flush your plants
[19:57.200 --> 20:01.840]  It's so essential if you're gonna try to compete you have to flush your yes
[20:02.040 --> 20:08.280]  You have when you're smoking 10 or 15 strains in a row and number eight tastes like fucking worm castings
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.600]  It ain't gonna win you can tell like I said earlier
[20:11.600 --> 20:16.800]  We're going for flavor a lot of it is flavor. Once you've smoked 50 samples. You don't get much higher
[20:16.800 --> 20:18.840]  You're already peaked out. Your lungs are burnt out
[20:18.840 --> 20:21.720]  It's got to stand out and flavor is what's going to make it do it
[20:22.000 --> 20:24.680]  Unless you hit one that really just puts you on your ass
[20:24.920 --> 20:25.640]  Then you go
[20:25.640 --> 20:25.800]  Oh
[20:25.800 --> 20:30.440]  That one might be special and then you're gonna have to taste that one again in a minute to see is it tastes really good
[20:30.440 --> 20:34.760]  Is it potent because there are a lot of great things in there and the ones that taste best are the ones you're gonna
[20:34.760 --> 20:36.760]  You're gonna remember the most
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  And after you body is so saturated
[20:39.120 --> 20:41.880]  If I watch people there their eyes were red
[20:42.000 --> 20:46.480]  Like we smoked from four o'clock until 11 o'clock at night in that place judging these products
[20:46.520 --> 20:48.080]  Like we people were lit
[20:48.080 --> 20:49.920]  so if you're gonna enter
[20:49.920 --> 20:51.800]  Make it think about it
[20:51.800 --> 20:55.240]  Like you were putting it under a microscope and you were handing it to the best
[20:55.520 --> 21:00.920]  Smokers and growers on the planet because it is going to be scrutinized. It is going to be judged. That's the point
[21:00.920 --> 21:03.680]  You want it judged make sure you didn't do anything wrong
[21:04.120 --> 21:10.240]  And don't be afraid to lose because everybody else entered the same way the same attitude that you did
[21:10.240 --> 21:15.160]  They brought their best so just be proud and have fun with everybody and enjoy the competition
[21:17.040 --> 21:21.800]  It's one of the things you got to remember is you're not doing this just for the trophy do it to have fun
[21:21.800 --> 21:25.960]  yeah, that's a big part of it and for the passion just to just to be a part of it the
[21:26.640 --> 21:32.200]  The just the concept of the judge having a day or three days to smoke through
[21:32.880 --> 21:36.040]  You know all those herb samples and all those concentrate samples
[21:36.600 --> 21:39.520]  Like I remember reading stuff about this in high times back
[21:39.960 --> 21:45.360]  1520 years when they talk about the cup at Amsterdam and just how overwhelming it would be for the judges to
[21:45.600 --> 21:48.880]  just like they have fucking homework notebooks full of shit and
[21:49.560 --> 21:54.600]  Trying to keep the sample straight and it's a lot of work on the judges folks. You got to remember that piece
[21:54.600 --> 21:55.760]  Here's one more piece
[21:55.760 --> 22:01.320]  Well, actually what's fun about the dude grows cup is everybody's a judge everybody that enters get five gets five tokens
[22:01.320 --> 22:05.400]  And then once you smoke the boats, you get five votes. You can put those wherever you want
[22:05.400 --> 22:06.440]  Yeah, I thought that was kind of cool
[22:06.440 --> 22:10.320]  So everybody that paid money to have a ticket was considered a judge so we all got to try it
[22:10.720 --> 22:15.080]  Another thing I want to add on to this and this will be my last part about this about if you're trying to enter
[22:15.480 --> 22:20.680]  Don't enter a big old giant donkey dick bud and don't enter a bunch of crappy
[22:20.920 --> 22:24.240]  Fucking kibble enter some decent sized bag of peel buds
[22:24.240 --> 22:29.980]  Most places want approximately an ounce give us like a few nice nuggets
[22:29.980 --> 22:31.980]  Don't give us one fat ounce bud
[22:32.040 --> 22:34.040]  Don't give us a bunch of shake and crap
[22:34.080 --> 22:38.760]  Show us give us a bag that can be divided up amongst like 28 judges
[22:38.760 --> 22:42.340]  If you got an ounce give me like 28 gram gram buds would be awesome
[22:42.340 --> 22:46.940]  Like you want a size to a gram size nug is what you're looking for
[22:46.940 --> 22:47.300]  Yeah
[22:47.300 --> 22:48.260]  so that we can
[22:48.260 --> 22:52.540]  We can share it we can all enjoy it and look at it and everybody can get a little visual of it
[22:52.540 --> 22:57.020]  We can see what the texture the colors the aromas the bag appeal all of that matters to me
[22:57.180 --> 23:01.580]  Because if you've got 22 different jars of bud the visual is a big part of it
[23:01.580 --> 23:06.380]  And like I said, once we've smoked 20 or 30 jars, I don't but there it's that
[23:06.460 --> 23:11.460]  Visual is gonna matter because the potency doesn't matter anymore the visual the aroma and the taste
[23:11.460 --> 23:15.500]  That's what's gonna get me. Yep. All right, so I've rambled along about that one for a long time
[23:15.580 --> 23:19.700]  Let's move to the next question here. I really like this email. This is a whole episode worth of questions
[23:19.700 --> 23:20.180]  I like it
[23:20.180 --> 23:25.820]  How often should my exhaust fan kick on I run a carbon filter attached to my fan in the tent?
[23:25.980 --> 23:30.340]  For the previous setup and I felt like it the smell suffered due to the constant scrubbing
[23:30.340 --> 23:34.460]  I have configured my setup to where the fan and the filter are outside the tent
[23:34.460 --> 23:39.220]  But now wondering how often I should be running refreshing my air in my tent
[23:39.220 --> 23:44.060]  I have it have the setup currently running 15 minutes every four hours
[23:45.740 --> 23:49.100]  Um, the first thing that caught my attention and Mike nodded at me also
[23:49.620 --> 23:55.980]  The carbon filter did not mess with the I think he's saying that it messed with the aroma the smell suffered
[23:55.980 --> 24:01.100]  So I think he's saying it mess with the aroma of the final product. It shouldn't yeah, that's not if that's not possible
[24:01.100 --> 24:03.580]  That's not a thing that carbon filter did not did not do that
[24:03.580 --> 24:07.820]  Like it's not sucking terpenes out of the plant, right? Right? Yeah, that is not a thing
[24:07.820 --> 24:15.660]  So the other red the first red flag for me was that a that's not a thing in what's your humidity doing?
[24:15.660 --> 24:21.460]  Right. That's what I was going to say. He's running it every 15 minutes or 15 minutes for every four hours
[24:21.460 --> 24:27.260]  I would do it a little more frequently. Yeah, probably once every hour, but I would just pay attention to the humidity
[24:27.260 --> 24:30.740]  What is it like in there? Do you have a way to monitor the humidity?
[24:30.740 --> 24:33.060]  You're going to get a spike when the lights go off
[24:33.060 --> 24:38.580]  You've got all that water in the air because the lights have been creating heat. All the water is evaporated
[24:38.580 --> 24:41.500]  It's in the air. You're going to turn off the lights
[24:41.500 --> 24:45.260]  Your humidity is going to spike and then it's going to drop you're gonna get a few movements
[24:45.260 --> 24:48.860]  And then when the lights come back on it's gonna do weird things also
[24:49.220 --> 24:56.500]  So, how are you able to monitor that when you can see what's happening in there? You'll know better how to adjust your
[24:57.020 --> 24:57.980]  your
[24:57.980 --> 25:01.700]  Exhaust you may need a dehumidifier also if you've got too much humidity in there
[25:01.780 --> 25:05.380]  But I would get something that can monitor the VPD
[25:05.380 --> 25:07.220]  I would grab something like a
[25:07.220 --> 25:11.700]  PL grow monitor and put that in there and that way you can check on your phone at any time
[25:11.700 --> 25:17.780]  You can see what the VPD of that grow room is you can see when it is necessary to recycle the air in that tent
[25:18.500 --> 25:20.860]  Like I would definitely go like 15 minutes an hour
[25:21.140 --> 25:27.260]  Yeah, 15 minutes every hour at least refresh the air at least refresh it that's going to increase your co2
[25:27.260 --> 25:30.500]  It's going to just refresh the air. It's going to help with your humidity
[25:30.500 --> 25:35.900]  I think one time every hour, maybe just 10 minutes. Honestly, there's no reason to turn it off
[25:35.900 --> 25:42.280]  I was just about to say most of the setups I've helped design and build for in-home production
[25:43.900 --> 25:47.260]  Just had an on and an off and they just ran forever
[25:47.580 --> 25:48.300]  Yeah
[25:48.300 --> 25:49.500]  The way I do mine
[25:49.500 --> 25:54.400]  So I run a different different couple of setups when I have tents the way that I have a tent set up right now
[25:54.400 --> 25:55.820]  I've got a carbon filter
[25:55.820 --> 26:01.300]  It is sitting on a cinder block in the corner because it is honestly too heavy to hang in that room
[26:01.300 --> 26:03.500]  I would rather hang it in the tent, but it won't hang
[26:03.500 --> 26:08.400]  It's heavy so it is on a cinder block and it is upright then the duct comes off of that
[26:08.400 --> 26:12.140]  It goes over the light which is a light hood with glass so that I'm sealed up
[26:12.260 --> 26:14.740]  Then it goes up to an exhaust fan the exhaust
[26:15.320 --> 26:20.980]  Sits on top of the hut outside of the hut and it sucks the air through the cars and filter sitting right there, right?
[26:21.820 --> 26:26.100]  Yeah pulling so I'm blowing the air through the carbon filter over the light and then up
[26:26.380 --> 26:32.940]  out of the blower out of the tent and it blows it into the room and that room has enough circulation of air and
[26:33.500 --> 26:38.140]  What's the room central air cooling in that room to where I don't have to worry about it getting stale in there
[26:38.140 --> 26:40.300]  I just leave that room open and it works with the rest of the house
[26:40.660 --> 26:45.300]  So what works is when I zip it up all those passive ducts at the bottom of the tent
[26:45.300 --> 26:49.460]  Most of the grow hit grow huts and grow tents have passive vents at the bottom
[26:49.540 --> 26:54.060]  So if I just unvelcro those I pull in enough fresh air through the bottom right there
[26:54.060 --> 26:56.420]  And it just sucks all my stale air right out of that tent
[26:56.420 --> 27:02.340]  And I've got a six inch blower on a 5x5 tent and when I zip it up it caves in it doesn't like crush in
[27:02.340 --> 27:04.020]  But you can tell it sucks in pretty well
[27:04.020 --> 27:05.580]  So I'm getting plenty of airflow
[27:05.580 --> 27:10.880]  By the size of your tent if you've got a big enough fan just to you don't want it to cave in you want to
[27:10.880 --> 27:15.020]  See it like kind of billow in just a little bit. It's not gonna crush but you can tell it's creating some pressure
[27:15.180 --> 27:21.940]  You know that you were evacuating out enough air and replacing enough air to where it's not getting stale and that carbon filter is
[27:21.980 --> 27:27.220]  Not going to deplete the smell of your cannabis. I would put that back in the tent is what I would do
[27:27.540 --> 27:31.660]  All right, so I want to move into the next paragraph. Where are we? I'm right here
[27:31.660 --> 27:37.340]  He says for your patreon campaign. You may want to consider putting a select your own donation amount button
[27:37.340 --> 27:40.860]  I was fully planning on donating 10 bucks a month when I first signed up
[27:40.860 --> 27:44.660]  But I was limited to the preset options of 420 710, etc
[27:44.660 --> 27:48.300]  And I chose 710 instead of the full $10 as I had planned
[27:48.300 --> 27:51.620]  Oh, I just ripped myself off for a good $2 and 90 cents
[27:51.620 --> 27:57.300]  Yeah, he said you might be limiting what you bring in monthly due to your limited donation options. It's possible
[27:57.380 --> 28:00.560]  It's always possible that patreon does not support this option as well
[28:00.560 --> 28:06.340]  You know, I don't remember seeing the add your own thing button. So I may want to add a dollar and ten bucks
[28:06.340 --> 28:10.160]  I may want to go add a few more tiers so that people can help out at different levels
[28:10.160 --> 28:14.640]  I appreciate that that may be really good. So that may be a million dollar tip right there
[28:14.640 --> 28:18.960]  You never know in the long run if it's a million dollar tip, we need to start talking about pay. Well
[28:20.380 --> 28:24.960]  Anyway, we're gonna move forward. Let's see. There's one. There's a couple of more things on here
[28:24.960 --> 28:29.240]  But I think we can cover it all in this one. This next paragraph is going to be great
[28:29.240 --> 28:32.140]  It says let's talk about bag seed. I
[28:32.800 --> 28:38.480]  Have on rare occasions ran across seeded buds from the medical dispensaries in my area. Yes that happens
[28:39.240 --> 28:41.360]  Should I even consider growing these out?
[28:41.360 --> 28:47.560]  My main concern is that the pollen would have potentially been from a hermaphrodite leading to these seeds to similarly herm
[28:47.800 --> 28:52.120]  Can I be sure that the seed is a representative of what was in the bag?
[28:52.280 --> 28:58.160]  My main concern is that it was cross pollinated leading to potentially unstable or unpredictable genetics
[28:58.200 --> 29:03.360]  My grow space is limited and this seems like a bit of a gamble your thoughts either way would be
[29:04.360 --> 29:06.080]  appreciated
[29:06.080 --> 29:08.080]  This is a fun one
[29:08.120 --> 29:14.240]  Those seeds could have come from anything where it could have been a it wasn't a male plant
[29:14.240 --> 29:21.040]  Chances are pretty good that the herb you've got in the bag is at least half the genetics of those seeds
[29:21.040 --> 29:24.120]  But that's really all you've got right, right
[29:24.120 --> 29:27.520]  So the the herb that you bought the label if it says blue dream or whatever you got
[29:27.600 --> 29:31.400]  Yes, that seed is going to be from a blue dream female, but at least 50%
[29:31.640 --> 29:35.060]  But where that the male part came from it wasn't a male
[29:35.060 --> 29:39.260]  It probably was not a male most the dispensary growers. We pull a male way before that
[29:39.260 --> 29:41.140]  We don't even have seeds in the grow most of the time
[29:41.140 --> 29:44.900]  It's all clones that have been passed around for a long time. So there's no opportunity for a male
[29:44.900 --> 29:49.300]  It was probably another plant that hermaphrodite it or what is possible and this does happen
[29:49.460 --> 29:55.580]  When a plant becomes too stressed or it has a light leak if one section of the plant is exposed to light quite often in
[29:55.580 --> 30:00.860]  A commercial environment there be a doorway right by the doorway where the two doors close. There's that little little tiny gap
[30:00.860 --> 30:04.860]  You'll get a little section of seeded buds right there and the plants don't harm from it
[30:04.860 --> 30:09.220]  But they just stress seed they'll make a couple of seeds in the middle. So you may have seeds like that
[30:09.220 --> 30:14.980]  It is hard to predict what you've got most likely. It is a stress seed caused by a light leak in a commercial facility
[30:14.980 --> 30:18.420]  Maybe they overfed it and it's stressed if you grow that
[30:18.940 --> 30:25.460]  You could have the most amazing shit on the planet or you could have the biggest problem on the planet. It is hard to predict
[30:26.660 --> 30:32.420]  Right some some hurt or some little mutant seeds come out like Wolverine and some come out like sloth
[30:32.820 --> 30:36.260]  Chem 91 and all of the chem dog strains were an accident
[30:36.260 --> 30:39.520]  Yeah, Girl Scout cookies in my theory was an accident
[30:40.180 --> 30:42.180]  GorillaGlue number four was an accident
[30:42.660 --> 30:48.060]  Golden goat was an accident many of the super popular crosses that we have got that we are using
[30:48.260 --> 30:53.980]  That were really popular for a while were accidents those seeds that are in that bag are accidents
[30:54.500 --> 30:59.100]  Sometimes when you look back at genetics of some of the really popular if you look back at the lineage of really popular
[30:59.260 --> 31:00.740]  Genetics you see in the family tree
[31:00.740 --> 31:03.460]  It will say unknown bag seed and a lot of them
[31:03.740 --> 31:06.420]  Because somebody just doesn't know what that was and back in the day
[31:06.420 --> 31:10.940]  We didn't have seed banks and breeders to order a shit ton of seeds from so if you've got a killer seed you grew it
[31:10.940 --> 31:16.420]  You wanted to see what it was and a lot of people started a lot of good breeding projects with unknown bag seed
[31:16.460 --> 31:21.740]  So you may have it's kind of like a you've got a pack of baseball cards right there. You could have a
[31:23.940 --> 31:25.940]  This is where the analogy falls apart
[31:26.620 --> 31:32.620]  Sports enough to name someone current or you could have the other one you can have a Mickey Mantle or you could have a
[31:33.220 --> 31:37.780]  Fucking yeah, exactly. Mm-hmm. Yep, exactly. You can have the gum. It's uh
[31:39.540 --> 31:41.540]  Yeah, who knows which one you've got um
[31:43.100 --> 31:50.940]  All of the chem dog lineage that all comes from bag seed that came from if you have not already if you are a cannabis
[31:51.820 --> 31:55.620]  Aficionado a consumer if you were into cannabis and you want to be part of the community
[31:55.620 --> 31:57.260]  I'm a piece of Canada history
[31:57.260 --> 32:03.300]  You need to read chem dog and the legend of the 13 beans that is really important that you read that all of those seeds
[32:03.300 --> 32:06.820]  We're bag seed and that is where the further generations of chem dog from the dog
[32:06.820 --> 32:13.940]  But it's like half the good weed of like the 2005 to 2010 came from that shit 91
[32:14.060 --> 32:17.780]  Yeah on and 91 on Nancy see how that works. Yep
[32:18.460 --> 32:22.460]  But uh, yeah, so what you who knows what you've got there me being fucking old
[32:22.460 --> 32:26.660]  I never want to go back that far if it's part of deadhead culture and cannabis culture
[32:26.660 --> 32:30.140]  So it collides into two of my favorite worlds if you have got extra space
[32:30.740 --> 32:34.380]  Grow that out if you don't have extra space, maybe you don't grow it out
[32:34.620 --> 32:37.660]  Maybe save that or pass it on to a friend that's got extra space
[32:37.660 --> 32:43.060]  I'm not sure what you've got when you grow it sprout the seed get it big enough to take a clone get a clone of it
[32:43.060 --> 32:48.020]  Either flower out that original seedling or flower out the clone and see what you've got if it's amazing
[32:48.020 --> 32:51.740]  You've got a keeper of it back there with that clone or that original plant if it's crap
[32:51.740 --> 32:53.940]  Then you've got another crap plant that you need to throw away
[32:54.020 --> 32:57.980]  But the only way to really find out is to grow it the world needs nickel fits to buddy
[32:57.980 --> 33:03.980]  That's that's the truth. You could have you could have the next Mickey Mantle card right there or you could have the gum from the package
[33:04.140 --> 33:06.140]  It's hard to guess it's hard to predict
[33:06.860 --> 33:10.700]  What strain did it come from it probably came from quality bud because you bought it
[33:10.700 --> 33:13.540]  It was probably the best on the shelf that day. They got your attention
[33:13.540 --> 33:21.420]  So you may get that you may get nothing like most of the seeds I get in dispensary herb are are pretty clearly stressed
[33:22.420 --> 33:28.980]  Yeah, those light leaks are a motherfucker and you cannot make owners understand simple shit like a pinhole can ruin a room
[33:28.980 --> 33:32.860]  I think our friend uncle Joey would say take a chance Columbus did
[33:34.700 --> 33:39.600]  And I would say grow up because I'm curious what's in there I'd want to know especially if I support our own backseat, too
[33:39.600 --> 33:46.720]  It's just hard with the number of limitations. I'm gonna say you're limited on space, but you're probably also limited on genetic availability
[33:46.720 --> 33:51.400]  I don't know what you're growing for if you're growing for your own personal medicine
[33:51.400 --> 33:55.200]  And you've got something that works stick to it. Don't change it if it ain't broke don't fix it
[33:55.360 --> 33:59.480]  But if you are growing and it is going to the market and this is becoming profitable
[33:59.760 --> 34:06.240]  If you grow that seed you've got something nobody else has it is unique you've instantly set yourself apart from the market
[34:06.240 --> 34:10.960]  So if you've got the new thing, whatever you want to call it, let's make up a name
[34:10.960 --> 34:14.600]  I don't know the fucking red gold and green Rasta flag. That's what's right in front of me
[34:14.600 --> 34:18.480]  So it was really easy if you're the only one with that and it's the new fire in town
[34:18.480 --> 34:22.400]  Everyone's gonna be talking about the red gold and green Rasta flag strain and you're the only one with it
[34:22.400 --> 34:28.280]  They gotta go to you to get that and that's always helpful if that is your approach to cannabis. So
[34:28.800 --> 34:30.680]  That's my insight into that one
[34:30.680 --> 34:37.120]  I I can't really give you any better advice on what's in that seed because it is like you said unpredictable
[34:37.600 --> 34:43.600]  Potentially unstable. Yes, also possibly the fucking champ. You could have Michael Jordan in there and you never know
[34:44.720 --> 34:50.360]  So the email keeps going he says below or a couple of pictures of a prototype cure jar with the lid built in
[34:50.360 --> 34:51.720]  I've been working on
[34:51.720 --> 34:56.920]  Actually, I've seen these from another person. I'm not sure if that's you but I've gotten some of these and they work very well
[34:57.080 --> 35:02.640]  It's a mason jar with a hygrometer lid inside of it so you can yes, I've gotten some of those from another person
[35:02.640 --> 35:06.640]  I'm I don't think that that was you I'm using them. They work marvelously
[35:06.640 --> 35:12.240]  They tell you exactly the temperature and humidity inside that jar so you can see how moist or how dry your product is
[35:12.240 --> 35:14.640]  You know when to crack it open, you know how long to leave it open
[35:14.640 --> 35:20.880]  It is beautiful. If you're making those along with the other person, I encourage you to keep going. That's a great product
[35:21.520 --> 35:24.720]  My voice is burning out. Hold on. Here we go. Submit a patent
[35:25.320 --> 35:26.080]  There you go
[35:26.080 --> 35:28.760]  The patent race is on because I know two people making this product now
[35:28.760 --> 35:32.200]  So when you guys has to get a patent and then one of you has to get a cease and desist letter going
[35:32.200 --> 35:38.200]  I'm just kidding become friends and then make a really great company loser. The first race does the fucking 30 gallon buckets?
[35:38.880 --> 35:43.480]  There you go. The five gallon buckets with hygrometer lids Lowe's buckets with hygrometer lids
[35:43.480 --> 35:46.640]  Just go the 30 gal plastic pop off lids the sweater buckets
[35:46.640 --> 35:50.760]  Oh, yeah, those are much easier to work with do fuck spinning those five gallon lids off. Oh, dude
[35:50.760 --> 35:54.400]  My knuckles hurt just thinking about oh, yeah, I remember opening buckets. That was way too many buckets
[35:54.400 --> 35:58.200]  We're gonna continue with this guy's email the next paragraph of this email goes like this
[35:58.200 --> 36:04.760]  I unfortunately do not have any pictures of the bottom with me currently if you're interested in seeing more I would gladly send them
[36:04.760 --> 36:06.320]  It's a fairly simple product
[36:06.320 --> 36:09.240]  Oh, he's talking about the other jars you talked to her with a hygrometer
[36:09.240 --> 36:11.640]  The hygrometer has a notch that keeps it pulled right to the lid
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.440]  The main the margin for error for one's picture for the ones picture is between three and five percent. That is pretty cool
[36:18.440 --> 36:23.000]  Are you aware of any similar products? Yes, unfortunately, I'm aware of the exact same product
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.560]  I got some from a friend at the end. Oh Expo and you're you're on the right track because they're needed
[36:27.560 --> 36:31.920]  So I do encourage you to continue working with these don't stop because someone else is doing it
[36:32.240 --> 36:36.680]  Many continues he says sorry for the book. Hey, that's all right. You made a great podcast episode
[36:36.680 --> 36:39.960]  This was a wonderful episode for 19. I'm glad Mike came over for this one
[36:40.120 --> 36:45.960]  I've logged on to your live chats numerous times wanting to ask these questions, but sometimes I feel weird in that forum
[36:46.320 --> 36:49.280]  man, I'm glad you sent me this because this worked out beautifully and
[36:49.640 --> 36:56.000]  Do you honestly Facebook live is or Instagram live is a motherfucker to ask questions in I have a good time there
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.620]  but sometimes it is chaotic and my fire is dissipated, but if you've got a
[37:00.360 --> 37:05.360]  Questions like these this is a much better format. Yeah, my ADD fires up so bad in the Instagram lives
[37:05.360 --> 37:09.360]  But it is so much fun. So don't be discouraged to join me there. Come hang out. He keeps going
[37:09.360 --> 37:14.480]  He says thank you for all you do. Hey, you're very welcome, man. Thanks for hanging out. Thanks for noticing. Thanks for appreciating it
[37:14.480 --> 37:18.120]  Thanks for the great email. Of course. Thank you for the great patreon contribution
[37:18.120 --> 37:19.280]  That definitely goes a long way
[37:19.280 --> 37:25.280]  He says I look forward to each new episode of the podcast whether they are grow lessons or ramblers with white Mike
[37:25.280 --> 37:28.740]  Hey, this was a little bit of both Mike threw up the devil horn saying what's up, bro?
[37:29.120 --> 37:33.920]  So Mike appreciates you too. As soon as you said there were some critiques. I was like, just let me have it
[37:35.280 --> 37:41.460]  He wraps up. He says I feel forever indebted and I hope that someday I can shake your hand and say thanks in person
[37:41.720 --> 37:46.980]  Stay I re bro. You are in no debt to me. You are growing great cannabis
[37:46.980 --> 37:52.260]  You were getting better. You are making a product for the industry for the community. You are know your debt is
[37:53.020 --> 37:58.620]  Excused relieved relieved is the word right? Your debt is paid bro. You are even we're friends
[37:58.620 --> 38:02.300]  I can't wait to shake your hand and smoke a joint with you
[38:02.300 --> 38:08.380]  Take a dab with you take a selfie with you and just hang out and fucking be I re army, bro
[38:08.940 --> 38:12.700]  So dude, thank you for the great email. He signs his name. I prefer you don't use my whole name
[38:13.420 --> 38:14.500]  Aka
[38:14.500 --> 38:17.380]  Know me by my guacamole. That is fucking cool
[38:17.380 --> 38:19.620]  I hope I can say that part because I want to say that on the air
[38:19.620 --> 38:22.380]  So big shout out to my friend know me by my guacamole
[38:23.300 --> 38:27.460]  Say that again Mike know me by my guacamole. I want to write a fucking song about that
[38:27.460 --> 38:29.580]  Hey, thank you for the great email. I do appreciate that
[38:30.300 --> 38:36.460]  That is all of the emails. I'm going to read for this episode of 40 minute episode for number 419. Thanks for hanging out
[38:36.460 --> 38:38.460]  Hey Mike, thanks for coming for this one. Hell. Yeah, man
[38:38.980 --> 38:42.660]  20 coming up next for 20 coming up next in the next episode
[38:42.660 --> 38:47.500]  We're going to talk about what for 20 means to people what it means to me. We'll hear what it was from Mike
[38:47.700 --> 38:50.020]  What is for 20 mean to you if you haven't told me yet?
[38:50.020 --> 38:54.660]  It's too late to get it on the show. The next episode will be the 420 episode you guys
[38:55.940 --> 38:59.140]  420 is coming 420 means a lot to a lot of us
[39:00.260 --> 39:04.660]  Cannabis and 420 and this movement and this culture are in the spotlight
[39:04.660 --> 39:09.460]  It is our responsibility to handle this spotlight responsibly. Don't be that guy
[39:11.220 --> 39:13.220]  Don't be that non-binary
[39:13.420 --> 39:16.900]  Gendered human being that fucks it up for the rest of the cannabis industry
[39:17.060 --> 39:22.860]  Whatever you're doing on 420 or anytime when you are involved around supporting participating advocating
[39:23.500 --> 39:27.900]  Optics everything about cannabis think about it this way Mike taught me this a long time ago
[39:28.140 --> 39:33.980]  Think about the story on the front page of the paper tomorrow from whatever you're doing some dipshit did this at this event?
[39:33.980 --> 39:40.260]  Don't be that guy. Just don't be the cause of a stupid fucking news article that really shines a negative light on cannabis
[39:40.260 --> 39:43.460]  We're getting there you guys we're getting there. It's getting mainstream
[39:43.460 --> 39:50.060]  We're legalizing it people are respecting it only thing that can stop us now is us. Yeah, hope that is the absolute truth
[39:50.100 --> 39:52.580]  The only thing that can stop us is us
[39:52.620 --> 39:59.100]  So ladies and gentlemen boys and girls smokers and growers consumers advocates supporters podcast listeners everybody out there
[39:59.100 --> 40:04.500]  It is our responsibility to treat cannabis the best way we can with full respect and love
[40:04.500 --> 40:09.140]  So let's not embarrass ourselves the culture the movement this podcast the plant
[40:09.140 --> 40:13.780]  Let's not fuck it up on 420 and let's continue that theme for the rest of the year
[40:13.780 --> 40:19.760]  We've gotten so far and just like Mike said the only ones that can fuck this up is us. It's in our hands now
[40:19.760 --> 40:24.780]  There's big business behind us. There's corporate behind us. There is money behind us
[40:24.780 --> 40:28.840]  We've got politicians that say they're all about cannabis now. It's happening you guys
[40:28.840 --> 40:34.920]  The revolution is here the times that our parents said would never fucking happen. We did it. It's happening. Yes, it is now
[40:34.920 --> 40:37.200]  I wish some of my other family members were here to see it
[40:37.200 --> 40:40.240]  But I'm really proud that the ones that are here get to be a part of it with me
[40:40.240 --> 40:44.020]  So this is amazing. That was a really cool rant to wrap up number 419
[40:44.760 --> 40:49.280]  It honestly did that's a rant. I've been trying not to go off on for like two weeks now
