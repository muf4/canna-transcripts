[00:12.990 --> 00:24.560]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for episode number 69 of the Grow From
[00:24.560 --> 00:28.600]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:28.600 --> 00:32.880]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:32.880 --> 00:36.340]  or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:36.340 --> 00:40.960]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:40.960 --> 00:44.680]  host, Rasta Jeff. Thanks again for joining me. As always, I need to send a huge thank
[00:44.680 --> 00:48.120]  you shout out to the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on the show. Big
[00:48.120 --> 00:52.920]  thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew. What's up, guys? I'm back with
[00:52.920 --> 00:56.760]  another solo episode. Nobody's hanging out with me today. It's me all by myself. Before
[00:56.760 --> 01:02.040]  we get too far, I do need to send you guys a huge apology. I know that there was an issue
[01:02.040 --> 01:05.800]  with the last episode I posted to Stitcher, but it has since been corrected. I'm going
[01:05.800 --> 01:09.940]  to drop down that music a little bit. I'm going to repeat that. The last episode I posted
[01:09.940 --> 01:14.120]  to Stitcher went up. It went to iTunes. It went to Stitcher. It went to the website.
[01:14.120 --> 01:17.880]  Everything went perfectly, but for some reason, when Stitcher grabbed it, it only took the
[01:17.880 --> 01:22.560]  first 14 or 15 minutes of it. For the first couple of days of the week, you guys were
[01:22.560 --> 01:26.880]  only able to access a 15-minute episode. Right when the grow lesson came in, everything
[01:26.880 --> 01:31.600]  cut off. I apologize for that. Stitcher got it fixed. It took them a couple of days, but
[01:31.600 --> 01:36.040]  Stitcher did repair that for me. Big shout out to Stitcher. Big thanks to everybody who
[01:36.040 --> 01:40.840]  went back and listened to that episode. If you guys tried to listen and gave up because
[01:40.840 --> 01:46.080]  it sucked, go back. The whole episode is there now. It's a 30-something minute episode.
[01:46.080 --> 01:51.600]  We cover most of veg growth. Now that that's out of the way, let's move forward with the
[01:51.600 --> 01:56.240]  show. I received a question that I want to answer. It'll be real quick. Somebody asked
[01:56.240 --> 02:01.640]  me, why do you turn off the lights during your foliar feeding? When I'm using a bug
[02:01.640 --> 02:07.760]  spray or a foliar feed, I turn off the lights because when you spray the plants with a liquid,
[02:07.760 --> 02:11.240]  it makes little bubbles on there. Then you've got these high-intensity discharge lights
[02:11.240 --> 02:17.120]  right above them. It works the same way as if you took a magnifying glass and shone the
[02:17.120 --> 02:22.480]  sun through it. It makes that little, I call it a reflector bubble. The magnifying glass
[02:22.480 --> 02:27.240]  and the sun work. It makes that little dot on shit, and then it burns it. You can catch
[02:27.240 --> 02:30.920]  paper on fire. When I was a kid, I remember we used to burn ants and shit with the magnifying
[02:30.920 --> 02:35.240]  glass using the sun. The bubble on your plants will do the exact same thing. It'll create
[02:35.240 --> 02:39.760]  that magnifier bubble. The light will hit it. It'll intensify the light beam into one
[02:39.760 --> 02:44.160]  spot on your plant, and it will actually create a little burn mark on your plant. If you're
[02:44.160 --> 02:48.680]  using a foliar feed or a bug spray, I fully recommend you turn off the lights. It's ideal
[02:48.680 --> 02:53.480]  to do it right before the lights go out if you can, but sometimes we have jobs and shit
[02:53.480 --> 02:57.480]  that prevent us from doing that. That is why I turn off the lights when I foliar feed,
[02:57.480 --> 03:02.000]  and that's why I recommend you turn off the lights when you foliar feed or bug spray.
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.240]  Let's see. What's going on in my world? Man, I was at the spot yesterday. I spent a couple
[03:06.240 --> 03:10.080]  hours out at the spot dispensary in Pueblo West, and things are really moving forward.
[03:10.080 --> 03:15.000]  I should be out there growing cannabis very soon. Mainly, we are waiting for inspections
[03:15.000 --> 03:21.960]  from the city. We need a couple small more. We need ... Not important stuff. We need a
[03:21.960 --> 03:26.120]  few small steps to get through before I'm able to put plants in the spot dispensary
[03:26.120 --> 03:30.680]  and start growing recreational cannabis that you will be able to come try. That's right.
[03:30.680 --> 03:33.400]  I'll let you guys know when the plants are in there. I'll let you know when we put them
[03:33.400 --> 03:36.840]  into flower. I'll let you guys know when they're ready. I'll let you guys know when you can
[03:36.840 --> 03:41.960]  come get it. Also, before we get to the grow lesson, I wanted to talk about how much I
[03:41.960 --> 03:46.360]  feel like my head is improving. If you guys follow the show, you know that at the beginning
[03:46.360 --> 03:51.480]  of April, I hit my head. I had a serious concussion. A few episodes at the beginning of April,
[03:51.480 --> 03:54.640]  mid-April, were a little bit ... I'm going to say they were shitty in my opinion. I know
[03:54.640 --> 04:00.560]  they were not up to the standard I have created. They did not follow the format that I've created,
[04:01.080 --> 04:06.840]  I was not in my head. I was recovering from a major head wound. The good part is, I feel like
[04:06.840 --> 04:12.840]  I'm getting my shit together. It's been a week since I sat down to record and it came together.
[04:12.840 --> 04:16.840]  The recording equipment came together easily. My podcast notes came together easily.
[04:17.800 --> 04:21.880]  The notes that I wrote last week, I brushed them up and made a lot more sense out of them.
[04:23.160 --> 04:25.960]  The good part is, I feel like I'm getting back together. I want to thank you guys for
[04:26.720 --> 04:31.200]  sticking with me through my head injury while I've been a shithead. I have not been all here
[04:31.200 --> 04:36.000]  and I know that. I appreciate you guys that have not abandoned me and my show through that time.
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.160]  That's cool of you. Also, extra huge shout out to all the people who have sent me love and support
[04:40.160 --> 04:44.640]  and well wishes, telling me to get better, telling me to take care of my head. Several
[04:44.640 --> 04:49.120]  people volunteered to come do chores for me. I appreciate that. You guys have no idea what that
[04:49.120 --> 04:53.040]  means to me. I'm getting back on my feet. Well, I've been on my feet, but I'm getting my head
[04:53.080 --> 04:58.680]  back in there while I'm doing it. Let's move on to the grow lesson. I've written a bunch of stuff
[04:58.680 --> 05:03.960]  and I'm going to try to condense it all into one lesson for you. I may leave a little bit out. If
[05:03.960 --> 05:09.960]  you have any questions, just ask and I'll go back over anything I went too fast on. I'm going to
[05:09.960 --> 05:13.880]  take a quick drink and a dab and we're going to get on with the grow lesson. Here we go.
[05:13.880 --> 05:16.280]  Hey guys, while I'm taking a dab, make sure you support our sponsors,
[05:16.280 --> 05:20.440]  the Rocky Mountain Worm Company. If you need organic soil amendments or high quality worm
[05:20.440 --> 05:25.000]  castings, check out www.rockymountainwormco.com today.
[05:27.960 --> 05:31.960]  All right, guys, in the last episode, I talked a lot about vegetative growth and we got right up
[05:31.960 --> 05:36.120]  to the first day of flowering. That's where I want to start off today. Let's start a flowering
[05:36.120 --> 05:41.080]  cycle. But first, let's talk a little bit about the flowering period. I've alluded that there are
[05:41.080 --> 05:46.200]  three trimesters to the flowering period. Let me explain a little what I meant by that. For this,
[05:46.200 --> 05:51.800]  we're going to talk about a nine-week flowering plan. We'll use Grateful Dog as an example,
[05:51.800 --> 05:56.440]  because it likes to finish in about nine weeks. That's perfect. The first trimester is what I
[05:56.440 --> 06:03.880]  would refer to as the transition phase. The second trimester is full flower. The third
[06:03.880 --> 06:08.280]  trimester is the finishing and ripening phase. I'm going to try to talk a little bit about what
[06:08.280 --> 06:13.720]  the plants want during each trimester. I'll do my best to break it down week by week for you
[06:13.720 --> 06:17.400]  and let you know what to feed and what you can be doing to your plants each week.
[06:18.360 --> 06:22.600]  We'll find the main important things to do to your plants each week. Then I'll give you some
[06:22.600 --> 06:28.200]  ideas that'll really improve your crops. Then in a future episode, we're going to focus all about
[06:28.200 --> 06:34.200]  improving your crops. Let's get on it. Let's start a flowering cycle. Today would be day one
[06:34.200 --> 06:39.480]  of week one of flower. I would start on a Monday. That's just my preference. We've talked about that.
[06:39.480 --> 06:44.280]  I would go to that Monday and I would say day one of flower, week one, day one. Then I would
[06:44.280 --> 06:48.840]  go through and mark that calendar, week two, week three, week four, week five, week six, so that it's
[06:49.560 --> 06:56.120]  easily viewable. All right. You want to set the lights for a 12-12 cycle. That means we want the
[06:56.120 --> 07:00.440]  lights to be on for 12 hours and off for 12 hours of uninterrupted darkness every day and every
[07:00.440 --> 07:05.480]  night. We can't have any dark during the night cycle. I can't stress or any light during the
[07:05.480 --> 07:09.240]  night cycle. I can't stress how important it is to have total darkness for the dark period of your
[07:09.560 --> 07:15.000]  cycle. The room needs to be totally pitch black dark. If you can see any light in there, it's too
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.280]  much. If you can stand in the room and put your hand in front of your face, if you can see your
[07:20.280 --> 07:27.240]  hand at all, you need more darkness in there. That's completely important. It's also, let's see,
[07:27.240 --> 07:31.720]  where was I? It's equally important not to interrupt the dark period. Interrupting the dark
[07:31.720 --> 07:36.840]  period will cause your plants to possibly herm and possibly make seeds. Your plants are asleep.
[07:36.840 --> 07:39.960]  You want to let them sleep. It pisses you off when I wake you up in the middle of the night. It'd
[07:39.960 --> 07:45.480]  piss your plants off too. Running a 12-12 cycle, I like to keep my metal halide bulbs in for the
[07:45.480 --> 07:50.600]  first two weeks of flowering. For the first week of flowering, all right, here we go. For the first
[07:50.600 --> 07:56.120]  week of flowering, I would feed my vegetative base nutrients and I would start pumping up my P and K
[07:56.120 --> 08:01.000]  values. I would also keep focusing on root development a little bit. If I were using
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.600]  bottled nutrients, I would use a little bit of liquid karma, some silica blast. I would use a
[08:06.600 --> 08:12.600]  little bit of Humboldt honey and some roots ZHO or something similar, some kind of similar rooting
[08:12.600 --> 08:18.920]  powder or maybe some like, what was I using before? OGT, that works. Some great white shark works.
[08:18.920 --> 08:22.440]  Anything like that would work for you. Also, maybe I would add in some hygrozyme.
[08:23.000 --> 08:26.360]  Don't expect to see a whole lot of action from the plants your first week of flower.
[08:27.240 --> 08:31.480]  This is the start of the transitional period. Like I said, this is transitional phase
[08:31.480 --> 08:36.360]  from veg to bloom. Then in about six to 10 days is where you're really going to see your changes.
[08:37.640 --> 08:41.400]  Let me add something here while I'm thinking about it. Your plants are going to get fed nutrients
[08:41.400 --> 08:46.840]  on every Monday, but they're probably going to get thirsty and need a drink before the next Monday.
[08:47.640 --> 08:53.560]  It's probably going to be Wednesday or Thursday, but on that day, water your plants with just
[08:53.560 --> 08:59.560]  clean water, pH at 6.5. You don't want to feed every day because then your plants are going to
[08:59.560 --> 09:05.480]  start to get over fertilized and they are going to get what we call nutrient lockout. All of your
[09:05.480 --> 09:11.320]  bottled nutrients are salt-based. If we keep feeding these salts to our plants, they get salty
[09:11.320 --> 09:15.800]  and they don't want to take up more salts, so they simply stop taking up nutrients. That's called
[09:15.800 --> 09:21.240]  nutrient lockout. We're going to feed clean water every Wednesday or Thursday and prevent that
[09:21.240 --> 09:28.200]  nutrient lockout by giving these girls a fresh drink. That's going to put us into week two.
[09:29.400 --> 09:34.280]  For week two, I would start feeding my bloom-based nutrients and I would add some cow mag.
[09:34.280 --> 09:37.800]  I would add... This is if you're going to use bottled nutrients and this is what I would use
[09:37.800 --> 09:42.520]  if I were using Liquid Karma. If you're using a different brand, all of these products are easily
[09:42.520 --> 09:47.240]  replaceable. Just look at your feed chart and look at your other brand and replace the bottles. It'll
[09:47.240 --> 09:54.600]  be that easy. For week two, I would do some cow mag, some Liquid Karma, silica blast, and I would
[09:54.600 --> 09:59.480]  add a little bit of C-Plex. Week two is where you really need to start paying attention for male
[09:59.480 --> 10:04.120]  plants if you started from seeds. You're going to start seeing little ball sacks develop. If you've
[10:04.120 --> 10:08.760]  got males in there, get them out. In week two, you should start seeing pre-flowers and the plants are
[10:08.760 --> 10:13.320]  starting to stretch. By the end of this week, you should have identified your males and isolated
[10:13.320 --> 10:17.880]  them. If you don't plan on breeding, definitely get those males out of there. Cut them down.
[10:18.840 --> 10:22.040]  If you put them in the garage, they may keep going. If you put them somewhere, they may keep
[10:22.040 --> 10:26.920]  going and make pollen. Kill them. Cut them down. Kill them. Unless you plan on breeding. If you
[10:26.920 --> 10:29.800]  plan on breeding, then I don't need to tell you what to do with males. You've already got that
[10:29.800 --> 10:34.040]  figured out. For week two, they're pretty much just going to grow. You're going to start seeing
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.880]  flower sets start to develop. You'll start to see the sex. If you're using feminized seeds,
[10:39.880 --> 10:44.360]  still pay attention to the sex. You may get some hermaphrodites. Some shit could have gone wrong.
[10:44.360 --> 10:48.520]  You may have gotten the wrong seeds. You never know. Pay attention. Don't take that feminized
[10:48.520 --> 10:54.040]  label as the complete, this will be a perfect female plant. That could not be the case.
[10:54.760 --> 10:59.640]  All right. Week three. Week three is a busy week. This is where we really start getting busy.
[11:00.360 --> 11:06.520]  You should have identified your males by now. You should have pulled them. Hopefully,
[11:06.520 --> 11:11.640]  if you had clones of those, you tossed the clones of the males also. If you don't have nice bud
[11:11.640 --> 11:15.960]  sites developing by the beginning of week three, you may have a light leak or another issue during
[11:15.960 --> 11:21.000]  your dark period. If you're not starting to see little dandelion looking bud sites by now,
[11:21.640 --> 11:25.400]  go in the room at night and make sure you're not getting a light leak. A small light leak
[11:25.400 --> 11:31.480]  will prevent your plants from going into flower. For week three, I would feed my bloom-based
[11:31.480 --> 11:37.880]  nutrients. I would feed CalMag. I would introduce Fulvex. I would use Liquid Karma. I would use
[11:37.880 --> 11:45.480]  HydraPlex, C-Plex, Silica Blast, Humble Honey, and Hygrzyme this week. This will be the basic
[11:45.480 --> 11:50.920]  recipe through flowering minus the Hygrzyme. I only Hygrzyme every other feed. I do add a few
[11:50.920 --> 11:54.840]  other things to my personal mix, but this will get you guys through flowering. I don't want to get
[11:54.840 --> 11:58.360]  too crazy and have you buying a whole bunch of things when you're not ready for that.
[11:59.080 --> 12:04.280]  I did get this mix from the Botanicare website. If you need help mixing up a great Botanicare
[12:04.280 --> 12:07.720]  recipe, just go to the Botanicare website, go to the nutrient calculator.
[12:09.080 --> 12:13.080]  Basically fill it in. It asks how many weeks you want to veg, how many weeks you want to flower.
[12:13.080 --> 12:17.880]  It asks you which bottles of nutrients you've got. You click on those and it'll tell you what to feed.
[12:18.840 --> 12:24.520]  I would recommend reducing it just a little bit. Feed your plants a reduced mix and see how they
[12:24.520 --> 12:29.000]  react. You can always feed more, but you can't unfeed your plants once they've burned themselves.
[12:29.960 --> 12:35.080]  Don't overdo it. I like Botanicare. I like the company, but they are a company.
[12:35.080 --> 12:39.320]  They need you to buy more. They tell you to use a little bit extra is my opinion.
[12:40.120 --> 12:43.880]  The more you use, the sooner you got to buy another bottle. Anyway, let's talk more about
[12:43.880 --> 12:49.400]  week three. You can go get that on the Botanicare website is where I left off. If you're using a
[12:49.400 --> 12:54.680]  different brand, they do have a different feeding chart online for you to follow. Almost all the
[12:54.680 --> 12:58.840]  popular brands have a feeding chart right now. You can easily, like I said, you can easily swap
[12:58.840 --> 13:04.280]  out bottle for bottle. If you just read, like I said, Liquid Karma, read the bottle, see what's
[13:04.280 --> 13:09.480]  in there, look at whatever brand you're using, and the equivalent for your brand is there. It's all
[13:10.120 --> 13:13.320]  basically the same shit. I just prefer Botanicare if I'm going bottled nudes.
[13:14.280 --> 13:19.480]  All right. I also like to add a nice dose of carbs and sugars at week three. We're going to start
[13:19.480 --> 13:24.920]  seeing resin production around week, mid week three, early week four. Very little resin production,
[13:24.920 --> 13:28.760]  but it will start. Why not give it some carbs and sugars to start contributing to that? That's my
[13:28.760 --> 13:33.960]  opinion. I also think that carbs and sugars keep the mycos in your root zone living and healthy
[13:33.960 --> 13:39.560]  and happy. That is always a good idea to add those guys. In week three, we should really see
[13:39.800 --> 13:44.520]  bud sites developing. This is a good time to start lollipopping your plants. What that means is kind
[13:44.520 --> 13:48.760]  of cleaning up the bottom little mini buds and the sucker branches that aren't going to get enough
[13:48.760 --> 13:53.320]  light to become viable buds. Just get in there and clean that shit right out. Don't be afraid.
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  We'll do a whole lesson on lollipopping if we haven't already. You want to get in there. The
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.520]  light's only going to penetrate your canopy about 18 to 20, maybe 24 inches. If you're using regular
[14:04.520 --> 14:08.200]  thousand watt bulbs, if you're using lower wattage, you've got even less penetration.
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.960]  You're going to want to get in there. If your plant's three foot tall, you don't need a whole
[14:12.600 --> 14:17.000]  three foot stock. You want to kind of clean off the bottom 12 inches or so. That gives you more
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.320]  airflow down there. Those buds that develop down there are just going to be wispy shit anyway,
[14:21.320 --> 14:25.320]  unless you're going to make hash with it. Clean that up. Send all that energy up to the top of
[14:25.320 --> 14:28.360]  the plant because you don't want to waste time trimming that bottom shit anyway.
[14:30.040 --> 14:36.760]  We're going to lollipop, clean up the bottoms. Also, I would recommend switching from metal
[14:36.760 --> 14:42.040]  halide bulbs to high pressure sodium bulbs at the start of week three. Week three is the last
[14:42.040 --> 14:49.000]  week of the first trimester. It's the last week of the transition and stretching phase. After this
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.560]  week, your plants will quit stretching so much. Week three is really the super stretch. Then week
[14:53.560 --> 14:58.360]  four, they'll quit stretching and start working more on buds for you. In week three, you want to
[14:58.360 --> 15:02.920]  lollipop and you want to change to your high pressure sodium bulbs are your main goals for
[15:02.920 --> 15:08.040]  week three. Guys, I know I'm going kind of fast, but we got nine weeks to cover here and I'm only
[15:08.040 --> 15:15.400]  to week four and we're 15 minutes in already. Week four, I'm going to feed a very similar mix that I
[15:15.400 --> 15:21.640]  would in week three. Week four is the end of the stretch phase and the start of actual bud growth.
[15:21.640 --> 15:25.400]  You'll really start to see buds developing by now. If you don't, you've got a problem. We need
[15:25.400 --> 15:29.160]  to get in there and make sure you've got darkness. Make sure you don't have some shitty plants.
[15:29.800 --> 15:35.160]  So week four is another week to lollipop. You can definitely get in there and lollipop a little bit
[15:35.160 --> 15:39.000]  more. I just use my thumbnail. I don't trim my thumbnail all the way down. I just use that to
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.720]  pick off those little sucker buds, collect them up, put them in a little trash can and toss them.
[15:44.520 --> 15:47.960]  Put them in the compost pile if you're doing that. Those little sucker buds are just that. They're
[15:47.960 --> 15:52.280]  just little suckers. All that energy could go up to the top of the plant. If you guys are growing
[15:52.280 --> 15:57.480]  for just hash, you could do whatever you want with that. I get it. Now it's also a good time to start
[15:57.480 --> 16:01.720]  adding stakes or some sort of supports to the branches because we're going to get some hefty
[16:01.720 --> 16:06.520]  buds. Once we get into week five and six, we're really going to need stakes to support everything.
[16:07.160 --> 16:11.880]  But by week five and six, it's such a bitch to maneuver those plants. Your branches got long,
[16:11.880 --> 16:15.880]  sticky colas on there and you don't want to be playing with the resin and getting the resin all
[16:15.880 --> 16:19.000]  over your clothes. You want to leave that on the plant. So get in there about week four.
[16:21.160 --> 16:24.920]  I like to put a stake to support the middle cola because I know I'm going to have a big,
[16:24.920 --> 16:31.160]  huge fat cola. Then I like to put about four, maybe six sticks around the pot because I'm
[16:31.160 --> 16:36.200]  going to get some big colas. I use those sticks to strap up my major colas just right to the stick.
[16:37.160 --> 16:41.160]  I do it early because like I'm saying, in week five and six, I'm going to have some buds going
[16:41.160 --> 16:45.080]  on that I don't want to have to mess with so much. If I got them all strapped up already,
[16:45.080 --> 16:49.640]  I don't have to worry about it. When I'm working with soil plants, I usually don't use
[16:49.720 --> 16:55.320]  a trellis or a screen or anything. But at the dispensary where I'm running the big grow,
[16:55.320 --> 17:00.040]  we're definitely using a trellis. If you're going to trellis the plants, you need to get that in
[17:00.040 --> 17:05.080]  there during your veg cycle. That's why when I was doing the veg lesson, I mentioned that this
[17:05.080 --> 17:09.320]  is the week to do any type of trellising and shit like that. That'll have to happen in veg,
[17:09.320 --> 17:13.080]  you guys, because those plants are going to grow up into that trellis and you don't want to be
[17:13.080 --> 17:17.160]  bending them and folding them and manipulating them in flower. So you have to be prepared for
[17:17.160 --> 17:20.840]  that. That's why we're making a schedule now before we put these plants in the dirt or in the
[17:20.840 --> 17:27.080]  rockwool cubes. So get your stakes up, you guys. Water healthy, get your stakes up, more lollipopping.
[17:27.080 --> 17:31.400]  That's what you're doing for week four. Let's transition into week five now. This is when the
[17:31.400 --> 17:35.800]  fun starts, you guys. The plants start getting photogenic, the buds start getting chunky.
[17:36.600 --> 17:40.920]  Since we're getting chunky buds, it's a good time to stop foliar feeding. I don't talk a lot about
[17:40.920 --> 17:45.720]  foliar feeding. I will in the future. Foliar feeding can lead to a lot of problems if it's
[17:45.720 --> 17:50.440]  done incorrectly or at the wrong time. So I haven't introduced that yet. But if you have
[17:50.440 --> 17:54.520]  gone on your own and started foliar feeding, week five is when I would recommend you quit.
[17:56.600 --> 18:00.840]  It's also important to pay attention to your humidity in week five. High humidity and big
[18:00.840 --> 18:06.360]  buds can be a great way to create powdery mildew or other mold-related problems. I'm sure you guys
[18:06.360 --> 18:11.160]  that listen to the podcast have heard me talk about growing in a new room. I was in a basement.
[18:11.160 --> 18:18.120]  I had an exterior wall corner that got really cold. That corner pocket right there had a lot
[18:18.120 --> 18:23.880]  of cold air. I had a five-ounce white rhino plant that I cut down and discovered powdery mildew on
[18:23.880 --> 18:30.520]  one bud of it as I was cutting it down. I threw the entire plant away, about probably five ounces
[18:30.520 --> 18:34.440]  worth of good cannabis, somewhere between four and six ounces is what those plants were averaging.
[18:34.440 --> 18:39.800]  So it was five ounces that my patients did not get to enjoy because I let it get powdery mildew.
[18:40.520 --> 18:44.840]  So pay attention to the room. Don't let your room get too humid. My problem was that it was cold,
[18:44.840 --> 18:49.080]  and I was letting cold air mix with the warm air, and that created mildew in my room.
[18:50.120 --> 18:53.240]  But I learned from it. I learned a whole lot. That shit will never happen to me again.
[18:54.200 --> 18:58.040]  And guys, if it happens to you, don't feel bad. Shit's going to happen. You just have to learn
[18:58.040 --> 19:03.000]  from it. It's how you deal with it is what makes you the grower. So do your best to get the
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.520]  humidity under control. You don't want too much humidity in there. You do not want to start
[19:06.520 --> 19:12.040]  getting mildew. For week five, I would recommend getting your humidity right around 50%. If you
[19:12.040 --> 19:16.600]  can get it to 40, there's nothing wrong with that. You don't want it too high. That's when you're
[19:16.600 --> 19:20.520]  going to get problems. Too low of humidity, your room's going to dry up kind of quickly, and the
[19:20.520 --> 19:26.200]  buds don't get as sticky, I don't think. But if you have the option, or if you're stuck with one,
[19:26.200 --> 19:30.840]  if you have to go too high or too low, definitely go too low of humidity. So let's see. We talked
[19:30.840 --> 19:34.840]  about getting rid of the humidity. I'm reading notes as I do this. Oh, this is where I would
[19:34.840 --> 19:39.560]  stop lollipopping. You guys, week five, don't lollipop anymore. You can if you want to, but you
[19:39.560 --> 19:42.680]  should have gotten all that taken care of by now, and you're just going to kind of shock the plant
[19:42.680 --> 19:47.320]  if you keep doing it. You may, if you keep lollipopping and fucking with the plant this
[19:47.320 --> 19:51.640]  far, and you may cause it to stress out and harm. Just depends on what other stress you're giving to
[19:51.640 --> 19:57.960]  the plant. So you should have a room full of sexy, chunky buds by now. They're going to start falling
[19:57.960 --> 20:03.080]  over and needing attention. So hopefully you've got plenty of sticks in there. You're in there
[20:03.080 --> 20:07.000]  paying attention every day. You're going to go in there one day and you're going to find a bud that
[20:07.000 --> 20:10.280]  you didn't notice, and it's going to be straight sideways, looking like it's ready to break.
[20:10.920 --> 20:15.560]  Don't panic. Just get in there and support it. Give it some support. That shit's going to happen
[20:15.560 --> 20:19.800]  to you. And you're going to learn all these things over a couple of grows of what to look for, and
[20:19.800 --> 20:24.440]  you'll learn to stop panicking. When you see a problem, guys, don't panic. I know I keep saying
[20:24.440 --> 20:28.520]  that, but if you freak out, you're just going to make it worse. When you see a problem in the grow
[20:28.520 --> 20:34.040]  room, just take a minute. It's a plant. We can fix it. Hopefully, if not, we'll just make BHO out of it.
[20:34.600 --> 20:39.960]  You're going to be okay. So for week five, I like to add a really strong dose of sugars and carbs.
[20:39.960 --> 20:45.400]  One of my favorite bottled products is Humboldt honey. I use that at week three, but I use a nice
[20:45.400 --> 20:51.640]  fat dose of it again at week five. So for week five, you want to make sure you've got your supports in
[20:51.640 --> 20:56.520]  place. If you haven't done it in week four, you may need to add a few more sticks in place for week five
[20:56.520 --> 21:02.120]  to get those bigger buds up in place. What I do, I put a, I think it's a six foot tall bamboo stick,
[21:02.120 --> 21:06.360]  because I grow big plants, you guys. I put a six foot tall bamboo stick toward the outer edge of
[21:06.360 --> 21:10.520]  the plant because I don't want to disrupt too much of the root. I just shove it right into there.
[21:12.280 --> 21:17.080]  Then I grab the bud that needs some support, and I use, I've used several different things,
[21:17.080 --> 21:21.880]  but right now I'm using, they call them fuzzy sticks. I got them at Hobby Lobby. They had a
[21:21.880 --> 21:25.640]  whole bunch for really cheap, so I bought a shit ton of them. It's kind of like a,
[21:25.640 --> 21:30.120]  it's a pipe cleaner, essentially. It's like a really long bread tie that you can handle better.
[21:30.120 --> 21:35.240]  So I just take that and I wrap that right around the stalk of the bud that's going to fall over,
[21:35.240 --> 21:38.840]  and maybe, maybe I'll do part of the bud. It just depends on how heavy the bud is, if I feel like
[21:38.840 --> 21:42.840]  it'll break the stick. But then I take that and just wrap it around the bud or the stalk and wrap
[21:42.840 --> 21:46.600]  that around the stick itself so that it's just strapped right up to it. Like you got a broken
[21:46.600 --> 21:50.920]  finger, just give that sucker some support. You just don't want it falling over and breaking,
[21:50.920 --> 21:55.480]  is your whole goal. Maybe if you tip it a little bit, if it's at an angle, it's a good idea because
[21:55.480 --> 22:00.520]  then you can expose more of that bud to the light instead of just having it completely up and down.
[22:00.520 --> 22:04.840]  If you tip it, you get a little more surface area for that light to hit, which will increase your
[22:04.840 --> 22:11.160]  harvests. So week five, you want to work on your supports. You want to feed some sugars and carbs.
[22:11.160 --> 22:16.120]  You want to monitor your humidity, get it around 50 to 40% and keep it there because you're going
[22:16.120 --> 22:21.160]  to start getting chunkier buds and you don't need mildew and you're going to stop foliar feeding.
[22:21.240 --> 22:25.240]  Alright, so that's what's going to happen in week five. That's going to move us into week six.
[22:26.280 --> 22:31.240]  In week six, I would feed a very similar recipe as I did in week five. I'd use high amounts of P and K
[22:31.240 --> 22:36.840]  and lots of sugars and carbs. I would reduce my base nutrients and focus on resin production and
[22:36.840 --> 22:43.000]  healthy plants. Week six will be our last full feeding. Our bud should be chunky and the resin
[22:43.000 --> 22:48.040]  should be starting to cover the buds and the small leaves. If you're growing a strain that purples up,
[22:48.040 --> 22:51.400]  now's a good time to lower the temps a few degrees during the night cycles.
[22:52.200 --> 22:57.960]  I try to keep my grow rooms about 77 or 74 to 77 degrees during the light period.
[22:57.960 --> 23:04.040]  During the dark period, I try to get it down to about 68, 69 degrees. At this point in week six,
[23:04.040 --> 23:08.840]  if I'm working with something that will purple up a little bit, like the Kalonji Kush or the Flow
[23:08.840 --> 23:15.160]  or the Ghost OG or the Grateful Dog, I would drop the temps down just a few more to like 65 degrees,
[23:15.160 --> 23:20.840]  maybe 67. If you get to that 65 at night, you'll see it in a night or two. Those plants will start
[23:20.840 --> 23:27.800]  to purple up. The leaves will turn purple for you. Higher CBD plants, I think like more cold,
[23:27.800 --> 23:33.000]  but that's just my experience with the Tora Bora and the Night Nurse. You may have a totally
[23:33.000 --> 23:39.160]  different plant, so don't take that as a rule. That's just my experience. You might want to lower
[23:39.160 --> 23:43.720]  the temps just a little bit if you're trying to pull out the purples. If you have more sativa
[23:43.720 --> 23:49.640]  dominant plants, this would probably piss off the Capelton. The White Widow would not like it.
[23:49.640 --> 23:55.480]  Lemon Jeffrey would not like that. Don't put those in the cold. But cushy plants, indica dominant
[23:55.480 --> 24:00.840]  plants, give them a little bit of cold and they'll purple up for you about week six. You're going to
[24:00.840 --> 24:05.240]  have to use more air conditioning, so that may cost you a little bit, but I think it's worth it
[24:05.240 --> 24:09.160]  for the plant that enjoys that. Week seven is a great week for photography, you guys. You got big
[24:09.160 --> 24:16.040]  chunky buds. This is, however, your last feeding, so whatever your plants are lacking or whatever
[24:16.040 --> 24:20.520]  you haven't gotten in there, this is probably your last chance to do it. We are going to feed on week
[24:20.520 --> 24:24.040]  seven, but we're not going to feed the entire program. We're just going to give a little bit
[24:24.040 --> 24:30.840]  of stuff to keep it alive and happy and healthy. So week six, basically work on a good feeding,
[24:31.560 --> 24:35.800]  lower your temps if you want, make sure you've got everything supported and staked up, make sure
[24:35.800 --> 24:39.640]  nothing falls over. Keep going through every single week, you guys, and check for herms, check
[24:39.640 --> 24:45.720]  for males, check for issues. I should say this also, every day, if you can do it every day, go in your
[24:45.720 --> 24:51.000]  garden and grab each plant and just grab one leaf and flip it upside down and inspect the shit out
[24:51.000 --> 24:56.440]  of it. If you see any signs of bugs, any kinds of pests, that's when we need to get in there and
[24:56.440 --> 24:59.960]  really deal with it. Hopefully you're not too far into flower by the time we discover a pest.
[25:00.600 --> 25:04.120]  If you're in flower when we discover pests, that's a whole other conversation. That's when you have
[25:04.120 --> 25:09.800]  to decide, are these pests going to ruin my garden before harvest time or can I eradicate these pests
[25:09.800 --> 25:14.120]  somehow? There are a lot of decisions to make in that scramble mode. We'll talk about that in another
[25:14.120 --> 25:21.720]  episode. I do have a whole pest management episode in the works. So week six, we have lower the temps.
[25:21.720 --> 25:25.400]  That's our last big feeding. We got chunky buds. Hopefully you took a lot of pictures in week six
[25:25.400 --> 25:31.320]  because week six is photogenic. Week seven, this is when we start what I've been calling the third
[25:31.400 --> 25:37.480]  trimester. This is ripening and the flush phase. We won't feed most of our nutrients this week. I
[25:37.480 --> 25:43.800]  would only use the humble honey for the yucca extract and the sweetener in there. That's really
[25:43.800 --> 25:46.920]  going to make your plants sweet. It's going to make them dense up and it's going to make them
[25:46.920 --> 25:53.320]  taste good and it's going to make them stanky. I would also use sea plex. I think sea plex really
[25:53.320 --> 25:58.680]  contributes to the aroma and flavor of a cush dominant plant. A lot of sea plex in your cushy
[25:58.680 --> 26:05.160]  plants will bring out that funk, that feedy smell. I really love it. A grateful dog loves sea plex.
[26:06.040 --> 26:11.560]  If you're growing grateful dog, when you crack it open, there is an offensive odor that comes out of
[26:11.560 --> 26:17.400]  it. It's almost foot like, it's almost armpit like, and it has a scent of fuel to it. I think if you
[26:17.400 --> 26:22.600]  pump up the sea plex or a sea kelp based product when you grow grateful dog, it will definitely
[26:22.600 --> 26:28.520]  increase that funky ass terpene you're getting out of it. We're using humble honey, sea plex,
[26:28.520 --> 26:34.680]  hygrozyme also. I like enzymes at this phase to start breaking down dead material, dead roots
[26:34.680 --> 26:39.320]  that have maybe died and need to be decomposed in there. The hygrozyme will help eliminate that
[26:39.320 --> 26:43.800]  shit and speed things along for the flush phase. Also add some fulvex if you want to speed things
[26:43.800 --> 26:50.280]  up. Our friend Sean taught us that you can use OGT to speed up the flushing phase of your plants
[26:50.280 --> 26:55.880]  because the rock phosphates make the plant cycle too quickly. It speeds up the nutritive cycle,
[26:55.880 --> 27:00.920]  so that will kind of assist us in the flush phase if we'd like to. I do not use any of that shit
[27:00.920 --> 27:07.320]  like final phase or clear X or any of that. I feel like that stuff leaves a little bit of a flavor
[27:07.320 --> 27:11.800]  in the plant. I also believe that if we are growing properly and we're flushing properly,
[27:11.800 --> 27:16.680]  we don't need that product. That's just another product to sell. There is a science behind it.
[27:16.680 --> 27:21.960]  Like I said earlier, we are filling the plant with salts and those flushing agents are basically
[27:21.960 --> 27:27.000]  sugars. Complex sugars break down salts, which would break the bond of the salts around the
[27:27.720 --> 27:33.320]  root base, which would allow cleaner absorption of the roots and everything would just taste better
[27:33.320 --> 27:37.160]  and it would flow better. I don't think that they're necessary unless you fucked up at some
[27:37.160 --> 27:43.240]  point in the grow. We're very close to harvest time. We really need to start getting the excess
[27:43.240 --> 27:48.600]  nutrients out of our buds before we cut them down and prepare them. We need to start getting
[27:48.600 --> 27:54.680]  the nitrogen, the phosphorus, the potassium, the manganese, the calcium, the magnesium,
[27:54.680 --> 27:57.960]  all the shit that we've been shoving into these plants. We want to get it out of there now.
[28:01.160 --> 28:06.760]  That moves us into week eight. Week eight is the official beginning of the flush phase.
[28:07.800 --> 28:12.120]  What I like to do, and this kind of depends on your setup, if you have smaller pots,
[28:12.120 --> 28:16.840]  you can move the pots to the bathroom or the shower, throw a cinder block, put something down
[28:16.840 --> 28:20.600]  so you don't scratch up the bathtub or the shower, you guys. Put a towel down, throw a cinder block
[28:20.600 --> 28:26.040]  or a bucket right in the bathtub or the shower. Then if you're using a three gallon pot, I like
[28:26.040 --> 28:30.760]  to run about nine or 10 gallons of water right through that pot. I know that sounds excessive,
[28:31.720 --> 28:36.440]  but what you're doing, you're washing the dirt. You want to get all of the nutrients that we've
[28:36.440 --> 28:40.760]  poured into this plant through the past seven weeks. We need to rinse all that shit out of
[28:40.760 --> 28:46.280]  the dirt now. It's also in the plant. The plant has been eating it, so we have to starve the plant
[28:46.280 --> 28:52.440]  for the next two weeks. If you're using bigger pots, it might not be feasible or rational to
[28:52.440 --> 28:57.560]  drag them to another room. That's fine. In a seven gallon pot, I usually pour about a gallon and a
[28:57.560 --> 29:02.200]  half of water through it and just let it fill up in that little tray. Then I'll use a shop vac,
[29:02.200 --> 29:07.160]  a wet dry vac to go suck the water out of the trays. I know that sounds excessive, but I really
[29:07.240 --> 29:11.880]  like to clean out the plants. If this method doesn't work for you, what you have to really
[29:11.880 --> 29:18.360]  focus on when you're flushing, you want water to come out of the bottom of the pot. I would
[29:18.360 --> 29:22.760]  like to say at least 10% of the water, I want to see that come back out of the bottom. That's how I
[29:22.760 --> 29:26.920]  know I'm actually flushing that plant and pushing something out. If nothing's coming out of the
[29:26.920 --> 29:31.800]  bottom, nothing's coming out. You got to get water to flow to get all those nutrients out.
[29:31.800 --> 29:36.600]  You're going to want to do that without drowning your plant. You're going to want to flush it,
[29:36.600 --> 29:42.120]  let it dry, and then flush it again as many times as we can until the end of week nine.
[29:42.840 --> 29:46.680]  The week eight is the start of flushing. You're probably going to water the shit out of it on
[29:46.680 --> 29:51.160]  Monday. It's not going to be ready for water again until probably Thursday or Friday because
[29:51.160 --> 29:57.240]  you watered it so heavily. Don't be in too much of a rush to water it again because you will drown
[29:57.240 --> 30:02.600]  the damn plant. Thursday or Friday when you water it again, do the same thing. Lots of water,
[30:03.480 --> 30:06.840]  just let it go right on through. Just let it drain right on through. If you've got
[30:07.560 --> 30:12.360]  like a floor drain or something, just keep pouring water through. You can't over flush in my opinion.
[30:12.360 --> 30:19.800]  It's ideal to use three times the volume of the pot. If you've got a nine-gallon pot or a
[30:19.800 --> 30:23.000]  three-gallon pot, you want to use nine gallons of water. If you've got a five-gallon pot, you want
[30:23.000 --> 30:28.120]  to put 15 gallons of water through that bitch. Is that what I said? Five-gallon pot, 15 gallons
[30:28.120 --> 30:32.280]  of water, it's three times. Yes. Just making sure I'm doing good math here. Head injury is coming
[30:32.280 --> 30:36.760]  back. All right. Flush really good, you guys. I bitch a lot about cannabis because it's improperly
[30:36.760 --> 30:42.760]  flushed. When you're smoking a joint, if the joint won't stay lit, if you have to keep relighting it,
[30:42.760 --> 30:47.160]  there's a good chance it wasn't flushed properly or I rolled it and I don't roll worth a shit.
[30:47.160 --> 30:53.800]  But if your ashes are black and chunky, there are still nutrients in there. You want a nice, clean,
[30:53.800 --> 30:59.160]  white ash that's nice and smooth and soft. You don't want chunks of it. If you ash into your hand,
[30:59.160 --> 31:03.720]  it should feel nice. You should almost enjoy that nice, smooth texture of the ashes
[31:03.720 --> 31:09.240]  if your plants were flushed properly. One of my biggest complaints about dispensary cannabis,
[31:09.240 --> 31:15.160]  and I am trying to fix this in my shop, they don't flush. They do not flush and they do not cure.
[31:15.160 --> 31:18.360]  They pretty much say, shit's done, cut it down and sell it. And I don't like that. So we're
[31:18.360 --> 31:23.000]  going to try to change that where I'm working. Flushing is important, you guys. I can't stress
[31:23.000 --> 31:27.960]  that. So from week eight, you want to flush, run plenty of clean water through that pot. Week nine,
[31:27.960 --> 31:35.320]  flushing is in full effect. Week nine ends at day 63. On day 60, here's what I recommend.
[31:35.320 --> 31:40.840]  Go in the grow room and start taking off all of the big fan leaves. Any leaf that has a pedial,
[31:40.840 --> 31:45.400]  that's a stem, you guys. Any leaf that has a stem that you can get to, take some scissors and cut
[31:45.400 --> 31:49.960]  that shit off really close to the bud. Just go in there and de-leaf the entire room. You don't
[31:49.960 --> 31:54.920]  need these leaves anymore. This is going to save you time when it comes to harvest. So day 60,
[31:54.920 --> 32:00.440]  you walked in there and you took off all of those leaves. Boom. Now this may sound crazy.
[32:00.440 --> 32:07.560]  This is what I do in my grows. I've got three days left, right? On day 61, I reduce my lights
[32:07.560 --> 32:13.480]  from 12, 12 to 10, 14. I'm on for 10 hours and I'm off for 14. The plants are going, oh shit,
[32:13.480 --> 32:18.360]  he's going to kill us now. The time is near. They know it. The next day, I'll drop them down to eight
[32:18.360 --> 32:25.560]  hours. And on day three, I'll give them 24 hours of total darkness. So day 63, no light at all.
[32:25.560 --> 32:31.320]  I'll leave them off for the entire day. Day 64, wake up bright and early, nice and ready.
[32:31.320 --> 32:37.400]  Go in and cut down the entire room and just let them hang. That's harvest day. That's 63 or 64
[32:37.400 --> 32:43.560]  days, you guys. Nine weeks of full flower. I got through that in 30 minutes. I did have to kind of,
[32:43.560 --> 32:46.520]  I did have to kind of skip a couple of details. I'm going to take a drink. I'm sorry. I'm trying
[32:46.520 --> 32:50.360]  to talk right through this, but I got to throw a thing. Let me take a drink here. All right.
[32:50.360 --> 32:54.760]  That's a little better. I got you guys through nine weeks and 30 minutes. I left some stuff out,
[32:54.760 --> 32:59.320]  but I feel like that leaves me more shit to teach you guys and more tips to give you in the future.
[32:59.320 --> 33:03.880]  You'll survive a crop with everything I taught you. Something that I should mention, if you do
[33:03.880 --> 33:10.760]  grow a longer strain, I would recommend reducing the light to 11 hours on and 13 hours off around
[33:10.760 --> 33:17.720]  week nine. This is only if you're growing something that takes 11 weeks or more. Some
[33:17.720 --> 33:22.520]  sativas won't finish up without a shortened day period. The reason is they are from an area that
[33:22.520 --> 33:27.560]  only have a few hours difference in the natural day and night cycle. So we need to encourage them.
[33:27.560 --> 33:31.000]  Oh, excuse me. I just burped right into the microphone. We need to encourage these plants
[33:31.000 --> 33:37.000]  to finish up by shortening the days. What happens when we shorten the days is the plant realizes
[33:37.560 --> 33:44.360]  that winter is coming and our plants main goal is to pollinate and create seeds.
[33:45.160 --> 33:49.160]  Since it hasn't received any pollen, it's being stubborn about finishing. It's like,
[33:49.160 --> 33:53.720]  I really think it's like a dude at a party. It thinks if it hangs out late enough, there's still
[33:53.720 --> 33:57.960]  a chance of getting laid. So what we got to do is we got to start messing with the lights and tell
[33:57.960 --> 34:02.440]  these guys, your time's up, dude. We got to turn to the girls actually. We got to turn the lights
[34:02.440 --> 34:07.080]  down and they'll start finishing on their own. Otherwise, some of these sativas will just keep
[34:07.080 --> 34:12.840]  on going. I had a Durban poison strain that went for 14 weeks and then I was getting tired of that
[34:12.840 --> 34:17.880]  bitch because I needed the room and I was done growing that strain in that crop and it wouldn't
[34:17.880 --> 34:20.920]  finish. And then I thought, well, why don't I just reduce the lights down a little bit
[34:21.480 --> 34:25.240]  and speed this up? And you know what, within one week of reducing the lights, it finished.
[34:25.240 --> 34:32.360]  I just had to tell it so. So also you may want to feed for a little bit longer if you're running
[34:32.360 --> 34:37.800]  a longer plant, I would extend the week six regimen. If you have to extend anything,
[34:38.520 --> 34:45.640]  just repeat week six until you get to the, like if you have three extra weeks, just do week six,
[34:45.640 --> 34:50.120]  three extra times. That's what I'm trying to say here. Guys, my voice is burning out. I've got a
[34:50.120 --> 34:53.480]  little bit more stuff here, but I'm running out of throat. So I think we're going to do another
[34:53.480 --> 34:59.240]  35 minute show and wrap this bitch up, put a bow on it. I appreciate you guys for listening to me.

[35:20.200 --> 35:25.720]  didn't tell me. And I will make a lesson out of that just for you in the future. Guys, I apologize
[35:25.720 --> 35:29.800]  that my throat is burning out here. Let's just wrap it up. So I don't have to sound like shit
[35:29.800 --> 35:33.560]  anymore. Uh, thanks for listening. I really do appreciate it. I think you can tell that my head's
[35:33.560 --> 35:38.760]  getting better. I really can. I ordered a product from on it.com called alpha brain. Uh, if you
[35:38.760 --> 35:42.840]  listen to Joe Rogan or any of those other podcasts, you've heard about alpha brain, alpha brain is
[35:42.840 --> 35:49.240]  used by public speakers and, um, lecturers and folks in that type of a position that have to
[35:49.240 --> 35:55.720]  speak, right? But they say that alpha brain, it's a nootropic and it is supposed to increase your
[35:55.720 --> 36:02.440]  ability to recall names and facts and locations. And it's supposed to broaden your vocabulary.
[36:02.440 --> 36:09.160]  So maybe that'll improve on my head injury and fix all my problems. All right. I really don't
[36:09.160 --> 36:12.600]  have a voice left. So don't forget to check out our sponsors, the Rocky mountain worm company
