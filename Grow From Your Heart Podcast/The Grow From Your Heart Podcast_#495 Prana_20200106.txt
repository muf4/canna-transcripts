[00:00.000 --> 00:01.920]  All right, here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01.920 --> 00:06.440]  It is time for episode 495 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.440 --> 00:09.320]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.320 --> 00:13.960]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:13.960 --> 00:22.480]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:22.480 --> 00:25.960]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:25.960 --> 00:31.200]  Today I've been taking dabs of Cherry Fluff Full Spectrum Extract from our friends at
[00:31.200 --> 00:32.460]  Green Dot Labs.
[00:32.460 --> 00:36.440]  This is a blend of bottle wash and cherry Cushmints on the package.
[00:36.440 --> 00:40.680]  The flavor is described as cherry marshmallow and leather musk.
[00:40.680 --> 00:45.980]  When I crack the jar open, I get a hint of cherry candies, not that CBD cherry that everybody
[00:45.980 --> 00:46.980]  is familiar with.
[00:46.980 --> 00:51.480]  It's a different cherry candy, more like a cherry sweet tart, a softer cherry, not that
[00:51.480 --> 00:55.200]  Luden's Cough Drop, but a different, softer cherry candy.
[00:55.200 --> 01:00.600]  Then when you dab it, I believe I got more of a chocolate covered cherry sort of a thing.
[01:00.600 --> 01:05.000]  Then on the exhale, there was a bit of sweetness that I will say may cover that marshmallow
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.760]  flavor they are talking about on the label.
[01:07.760 --> 01:12.120]  Great concentrate, definitely made me nice and talkative, this should be a great podcast.
[01:12.120 --> 01:19.080]  On the back of the package, it does say that this product contains 69.84% THC and non-detectable
[01:19.080 --> 01:20.680]  amounts of CBD.
[01:20.680 --> 01:25.080]  I think it's got a great flavor, it hits really smooth, and I think it has got a really nice
[01:25.160 --> 01:26.160]  buzz.
[01:26.160 --> 01:30.560]  So once again, big thanks and big shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious
[01:30.560 --> 01:34.640]  Cherry Fluff Full Spectrum Extract.
[01:34.640 --> 01:38.480]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, friends and foes, pimps and hoes, smokers
[01:38.480 --> 01:43.400]  and growers, breeders and seed hoarders, in this episode, I'm going to talk about another
[01:43.400 --> 01:44.400]  strain that I bred.
[01:44.400 --> 01:46.840]  I'm going to highlight the strain Prana.
[01:46.840 --> 01:50.800]  Before we get to the strain review, let's do some shout outs to a few of the folks who
[01:50.800 --> 01:53.840]  support the show on Patreon.
[01:53.840 --> 01:57.760]  Let's start off with the big, giant Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:57.760 --> 02:02.640]  Thank you and a shout out to my friend Tribal Garden for the very generous contribution
[02:02.640 --> 02:08.320]  to not only my Patreon campaign, but Tribal Garden also helped out several other podcasters
[02:08.320 --> 02:12.120]  and content providers through the Patreon application.
[02:12.120 --> 02:16.880]  So big thanks to Tribal for supporting the cannabis community very heavily for the month
[02:16.880 --> 02:17.880]  of January.
[02:17.880 --> 02:20.200]  We do all appreciate that support.
[02:20.200 --> 02:23.660]  Let's follow that up with a big, giant thank you shout out to my buddy, Bong Breath.
[02:23.660 --> 02:25.300]  That is one of my favorite names.
[02:25.300 --> 02:26.300]  Big shout out to Bong Breath.
[02:26.300 --> 02:29.740]  Also, I want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to
[02:29.740 --> 02:30.740]  Steven Smith.
[02:30.740 --> 02:33.740]  I need to send a giant thank you shout out to Jacob W.
[02:33.740 --> 02:39.020]  It is my pleasure to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Woodside195.
[02:39.020 --> 02:42.440]  Of course, we need to send a giant thank you shout out to Rue Lightning Tim.
[02:42.440 --> 02:45.340]  Of course, we cannot miss the hardest working man in cannabis.
[02:45.340 --> 02:49.740]  How about a big, giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and thank you to James Brown.
[02:49.740 --> 02:54.080]  And last, but certainly not least, let's send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
[02:54.080 --> 02:58.540]  shout out, thank you, and a fist bump to our buddy, Keith K.
[02:58.540 --> 03:02.780]  Big shout out and big, sincere thank you to everybody who has supported the show in the
[03:02.780 --> 03:05.580]  past, in the present, and in the future.
[03:05.580 --> 03:10.140]  This past Patreon month was the best month I have seen on Patreon.
[03:10.140 --> 03:14.060]  The goal is to keep making that Patreon rise, so you guys are doing it.
[03:14.060 --> 03:15.060]  Thank you.
[03:15.060 --> 03:16.680]  I do appreciate all of that support.
[03:16.680 --> 03:20.320]  If you're not already supporting the show via Patreon, you can learn how to do so by
[03:20.320 --> 03:25.720]  visiting www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[03:25.720 --> 03:29.400]  All of the information you need to help out the show will be right there on the screen.
[03:29.400 --> 03:33.860]  And just a reminder, when you guys help me out on Patreon, I use that support for things
[03:33.860 --> 03:35.400]  like paying for my website.
[03:35.400 --> 03:38.240]  I've got a website that keeps this podcast alive.
[03:38.240 --> 03:39.880]  It keeps it free for everybody.
[03:39.880 --> 03:43.340]  I will never charge you for this podcast.
[03:43.340 --> 03:49.380]  As long as I am able to podcast for free, you will receive this podcast for free.
[03:49.380 --> 03:51.260]  I do have a website that I pay for.
[03:51.260 --> 03:55.300]  The Patreon contributions offset the cost of my website.
[03:55.300 --> 03:59.220]  A couple of years ago, the computer that I produced the show with took a shit in front
[03:59.220 --> 04:05.420]  of my eyes, and my generous Patreon contributors and supporters basically covered the cost
[04:05.420 --> 04:06.820]  of a new computer.
[04:06.820 --> 04:12.380]  So with the help of my Patreon supporters, this show comes at you for free twice a week.
[04:12.420 --> 04:13.420]  So thank you.
[04:13.420 --> 04:15.700]  It just started to sound like a pledge drive.
[04:15.700 --> 04:18.100]  So I want to get out of that and get back to normal podcasting.
[04:18.100 --> 04:19.540]  I really want to say thank you, though.
[04:19.540 --> 04:22.500]  It means a lot to me, and it does keep the show coming to you for free.
[04:22.500 --> 04:25.300]  Those Patreon contributions are voluntary.
[04:25.300 --> 04:26.780]  Those are donations.
[04:26.780 --> 04:27.780]  I appreciate that.
[04:27.780 --> 04:29.060]  You don't have to do that.
[04:29.060 --> 04:33.020]  And I noticed that you reached into your pocket and you threw something my way for my work.
[04:33.020 --> 04:34.020]  I notice.
[04:34.020 --> 04:35.020]  Thank you.
[04:35.020 --> 04:38.180]  And if you can't contribute to the show financially, keep listening.
[04:38.180 --> 04:40.300]  All I want you to do is tell somebody about it.
[04:40.300 --> 04:42.980]  Say, bro, have you ever heard this grow from your heart podcast?
[04:42.980 --> 04:44.900]  Tell two of your friends that grow ganja.
[04:44.900 --> 04:47.320]  Maybe one of them will actually subscribe to the show.
[04:47.320 --> 04:48.860]  One of them will say, I don't listen to podcasts.
[04:48.860 --> 04:49.860]  I'm not into that.
[04:49.860 --> 04:50.860]  That's fine.
[04:50.860 --> 04:51.860]  That's not for everybody.
[04:51.860 --> 04:54.660]  But if one more person subscribes and then they hear this message and they tell one more
[04:54.660 --> 04:57.220]  person it spreads like wildfire.
[04:57.220 --> 05:02.660]  Hopefully we can get everybody growing better cannabis, everybody on team legalization.
[05:02.660 --> 05:03.940]  We get all on the same page.
[05:03.940 --> 05:05.180]  I'll quit rambling.
[05:05.180 --> 05:08.420]  Let's get into a strain review.
[05:08.540 --> 05:12.740]  Some people may not be aware that I am the breeder, the sole proprietor and founder of
[05:12.740 --> 05:13.740]  Iree Genetics.
[05:13.740 --> 05:17.700]  I make many regular and feminized seed lines.
[05:17.700 --> 05:22.740]  In this episode, we're going to talk about a cross I have made that I have called Prana.
[05:22.740 --> 05:25.300]  Prana is a wonderful and unique little plant.
[05:25.300 --> 05:27.860]  I really appreciate and enjoy this plant.
[05:27.860 --> 05:29.860]  She's got a special spot in my heart.
[05:29.860 --> 05:31.940]  She's got a special spot in my garden.
[05:31.940 --> 05:34.140]  She's got a special spot in my catalog.
[05:34.140 --> 05:36.220]  She's a really special plant to me.
[05:36.500 --> 05:39.020]  Let's talk a little bit about Prana.
[05:39.020 --> 05:42.920]  The first thing I want to cover is that Prana is not named after the fish.
[05:42.920 --> 05:44.300]  This is not Piranha.
[05:44.300 --> 05:45.980]  This is Prana.
[05:45.980 --> 05:51.060]  Prana is a word from Sanskrit and is often used in like a yoga type setting.
[05:51.060 --> 05:55.900]  I straight up got this by thinking, I was like, I need a yoga type word that means positive
[05:55.900 --> 05:59.020]  energy or upward flowing energy.
[05:59.020 --> 06:00.380]  Prana is what I found.
[06:00.380 --> 06:06.020]  It means life force or life energy or vital force or vital energy.
[06:06.020 --> 06:08.740]  Let's talk about why I chose that name.
[06:08.740 --> 06:11.020]  This is a cross of flow.
[06:11.020 --> 06:14.100]  You already see flow, moving energy, right?
[06:14.100 --> 06:15.100]  Flow.
[06:15.100 --> 06:18.060]  Then the other parent in this plant is of course a rise.
[06:18.060 --> 06:22.660]  I thought the flow of upward energy, the upward flow of energy is where my mind was going
[06:22.660 --> 06:24.380]  when I was trying to find a name.
[06:24.380 --> 06:29.420]  I was kind of looking at Hindu words and yoga words and uplifting words and Prana is what
[06:29.420 --> 06:30.580]  I came across.
[06:30.580 --> 06:31.580]  It really stuck with me.
[06:31.580 --> 06:32.580]  It felt right.
[06:32.580 --> 06:33.580]  It sounded right.
[06:33.580 --> 06:38.900]  I almost smelled the strain in my nose when I read the word Prana.
[06:38.900 --> 06:40.540]  So it really works for me.
[06:40.540 --> 06:42.260]  Prana is the name of the strain.
[06:42.260 --> 06:45.940]  Now let's talk briefly about the parents of Prana.
[06:45.940 --> 06:51.220]  I should go ladies first, but let's talk briefly about the male I used to make this cross.
[06:51.220 --> 06:53.020]  I talk about this plant quite often.
[06:53.020 --> 06:56.740]  It is a male arise plant known as King Solomon.
[06:56.740 --> 07:00.860]  I have a very special selected arise plant that is a male.
[07:00.860 --> 07:05.420]  To differentiate that one from my other arise plants in my garden, this one has been named
[07:05.420 --> 07:06.420]  King Solomon.
[07:06.420 --> 07:08.180]  It is the champion.
[07:08.180 --> 07:09.180]  He is the king.
[07:09.180 --> 07:14.380]  He is my stud male plant that does most of my regular breeding work.
[07:14.380 --> 07:18.380]  So that's King Solomon, a very select arise male.
[07:18.380 --> 07:24.940]  Arise is a golden goat female, which was pollinated by a daybreaker male.
[07:24.940 --> 07:29.360]  Daybreaker is Chem D and Joseph O.G.
[07:29.360 --> 07:34.840]  The daybreaker end of this cross is going to bring a fresh tennis ball sort of aroma.
[07:34.840 --> 07:39.760]  If you open a can of tennis balls and give it a smell, it's got a fresh tennis ball aroma.
[07:39.760 --> 07:41.720]  That's the only thing that smells like that.
[07:41.720 --> 07:44.960]  It's also got a fresh tires aroma.
[07:44.960 --> 07:48.960]  There's also hints of gas and pine and fuel.
[07:48.960 --> 07:50.320]  That's what comes from the daybreaker.
[07:50.320 --> 07:53.920]  So I bred that to the golden goat because it was the exact opposite.
[07:53.920 --> 07:57.800]  It is sweet and it is tropical and is a little bit fruity.
[07:57.800 --> 08:02.640]  I really found great contrast in those two parents, so I bred them together and it created
[08:02.640 --> 08:04.920]  arise, which was an amazing plant.
[08:04.920 --> 08:08.200]  I've done a full episode on the strain arise.
[08:08.200 --> 08:13.480]  If you are interested in hearing a very detailed strain description on arise, check out episode
[08:13.480 --> 08:16.880]  329 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[08:16.880 --> 08:20.560]  I go way in detail about the strain arise.
[08:20.560 --> 08:23.840]  So that is the male side of the cross of Prana.
[08:23.840 --> 08:25.600]  It is an arise male.
[08:25.600 --> 08:27.280]  It was King Solomon.
[08:27.280 --> 08:33.280]  Now the female end of that cross was a plant known as Flo and she's spelled F-L-O.
[08:33.280 --> 08:35.680]  There's no W on the end of this Flo.
[08:35.680 --> 08:37.960]  This Flo was bred by DJ Short.
[08:37.960 --> 08:43.040]  There's a very select cut that goes around Colorado that is known as the Colorado Flo.
[08:43.040 --> 08:47.880]  It's got a very beautiful and distinct aroma to it, which really transferred very well
[08:47.880 --> 08:49.400]  into the Prana cross.
[08:49.400 --> 08:53.960]  That was mainly my goal was to get that aroma into the Prana cross.
[08:53.960 --> 08:58.520]  I acquired this Flo clone from a man named Tom.
[08:58.520 --> 09:02.440]  I don't know if Tom wants to be identified too deeply on this podcast.
[09:02.440 --> 09:06.600]  This guy Tom has a lot to do with why I am the grower that I am today, a lot to do with
[09:06.600 --> 09:09.480]  why I am the cannabis person that I am today.
[09:09.480 --> 09:10.680]  I'm not going to give myself a label.
[09:10.680 --> 09:14.880]  I'm a person involved in cannabis and a lot of that has to do with Tom.
[09:14.880 --> 09:16.160]  I really had a passion for it.
[09:16.160 --> 09:17.880]  I really wanted to get involved.
[09:17.880 --> 09:22.240]  Tom really gave me a great avenue for branching out my career in cannabis.
[09:22.240 --> 09:24.600]  I owe Tom a big shout out, a big thank you right now.
[09:24.600 --> 09:25.600]  What's up, bro?
[09:25.600 --> 09:26.600]  I hope you're doing well.
[09:26.600 --> 09:33.600]  I acquired this cut of Flo from Tom around the year 2007 or 2008.
[09:33.600 --> 09:39.160]  At that time, the medical marijuana market and the medical marijuana movement was really
[09:39.160 --> 09:41.960]  blossoming here in Southern Colorado.
[09:41.960 --> 09:46.040]  At the time, I was running the only dispensary in my city.
[09:46.040 --> 09:48.840]  That's actually where I also ended up meeting White Mike.
[09:48.920 --> 09:54.480]  White Mike ended up becoming my backup bud tender and helping me out in the first dispensary
[09:54.480 --> 09:56.360]  here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[09:56.360 --> 10:00.440]  I was serving many patients this Flo medicine.
[10:00.440 --> 10:04.000]  They were getting the finished product of Flo and I found that it was helping a lot
[10:04.000 --> 10:05.000]  of people.
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.680]  I also found that it helped me quite well.
[10:07.680 --> 10:12.240]  I noticed it was great before work smoke.
[10:12.240 --> 10:15.120]  Sometimes you don't want to go deal with people first thing in the morning.
[10:15.120 --> 10:18.720]  If you've got to get up and get ready for work and drive to work and just deal with
[10:18.720 --> 10:23.400]  people immediately, sometimes it's nice to have a little bit of a buffer.
[10:23.400 --> 10:26.520]  I found that Flo was a beautiful buffer.
[10:26.520 --> 10:30.640]  If I burned one down of Flo on the way to work, it would just put a smile on my face
[10:30.640 --> 10:34.560]  and I didn't give a shit that I just had to deal with everybody in my town that wanted
[10:34.560 --> 10:37.000]  to buy herb and they all wanted it right now.
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.080]  They all had a bunch of questions and I haven't had a chance to handle my day yet and I didn't
[10:42.080 --> 10:43.080]  even care.
[10:43.080 --> 10:45.720]  I just wanted to smile and help these people out because I just smoked some Flo and I feel
[10:45.720 --> 10:46.800]  fucking good.
[10:46.800 --> 10:47.800]  It was nice.
[10:47.800 --> 10:53.160]  It was a great social lubricant, a good morning buzz, good smiley buzz, but it didn't fuck
[10:53.160 --> 10:57.560]  me up so much that I couldn't count money, that I couldn't function properly at work,
[10:57.560 --> 11:00.200]  that anybody would be like, bro, you're way too stoned to be here.
[11:00.200 --> 11:02.960]  All it did, the more I smoked it, it just made me happier.
[11:02.960 --> 11:07.440]  It just made me give two fucks less about anything that was wrong.
[11:07.440 --> 11:08.920]  That was why I really liked it.
[11:08.920 --> 11:13.560]  I noticed that a lot of medical patients were really enjoying the flavor, the aroma,
[11:13.560 --> 11:14.680]  and the effect of the Flo.
[11:14.680 --> 11:19.080]  I was really enjoying the flavor, the aroma, and the effect of the Flo.
[11:19.080 --> 11:24.060]  Eventually I acquired a clone of the Flo and I put it in my own garden and I quickly discovered
[11:24.060 --> 11:29.980]  that this plant finished about a week or two sooner than all of my other plants.
[11:29.980 --> 11:35.520]  This cut of Flo was finishing around eight weeks and if I got it too cold and overfed
[11:35.520 --> 11:38.480]  it, it would finish at the end of seven weeks.
[11:38.480 --> 11:42.840]  So I was really blessed with a fast finishing plant and I didn't even know it did that when
[11:42.840 --> 11:43.840]  I got it.
[11:43.840 --> 11:48.520]  I was just excited about the quality of the medicine that I knew it would produce.
[11:48.520 --> 11:51.360]  So I was growing this plant indoors in multiple gardens.
[11:51.360 --> 11:54.460]  It was in the Medomar garden, it was in my personal garden.
[11:54.460 --> 11:58.720]  It also ended up in our friend Steve's outdoor garden.
[11:58.720 --> 12:03.120]  We all noticed that this plant could take anything you could throw at it.
[12:03.120 --> 12:07.040]  It could take cold, it could take heat, the bugs didn't want to get on it.
[12:07.040 --> 12:09.920]  For some reason spider mites just didn't jump on the Flo.
[12:09.920 --> 12:13.840]  They would jump on everything around it, but they didn't get on the Flo for some reason.
[12:13.840 --> 12:19.400]  It could take overfeeding, it could take underfeeding, it could take bending, it could take twisting,
[12:19.400 --> 12:21.040]  and anything it would do, it would just go, yeah, that was cool.
[12:21.040 --> 12:22.420]  I'm going to keep growing.
[12:22.420 --> 12:24.640]  It was such a beautiful plant to work with.
[12:24.640 --> 12:29.360]  It could take all of the abuse, it could win all of the struggles, and still it would grow
[12:29.360 --> 12:34.880]  really stout and really robust, and it would finish by the end of week eight for sure,
[12:34.880 --> 12:35.880]  indoors or out.
[12:35.880 --> 12:41.800]  Then if you dried it and cured it properly, it gave this most wonderful aroma.
[12:41.800 --> 12:46.320]  I describe it as temple ball incense and dirty feet.
[12:46.320 --> 12:51.120]  It almost smells like you tried to hide a bag of kush with some nog champa, is kind
[12:51.120 --> 12:52.840]  of what I think it smells like.
[12:52.840 --> 12:55.120]  I really fell in love with this Flo cut.
[12:55.120 --> 12:59.800]  For a little while, everything in my life smelled like Flo because I was growing it
[12:59.800 --> 13:04.760]  in every garden that I had because it produced well, it stunk real nice.
[13:04.760 --> 13:08.640]  Then in the end of flower, if you grew it indoors or outdoors, if you got it just a
[13:08.640 --> 13:13.100]  little bit cold, or maybe if you dropped the pH a little bit, that plant would produce
[13:13.100 --> 13:20.560]  these beautiful orange and maroon and purple and gold hues late in flower, and it was so
[13:20.560 --> 13:21.760]  beautiful.
[13:21.760 --> 13:26.080]  It would change depending on your environment, but I saw so many great colors come from these
[13:26.080 --> 13:28.240]  plants and they never got too tall.
[13:28.240 --> 13:29.960]  They always stayed nice and stout.
[13:29.960 --> 13:32.840]  They always gave us a nice harvest, whether it was indoors or out.
[13:32.840 --> 13:37.680]  I really fell in love with the Flo, and that is why I knew that I had to breed with the
[13:37.680 --> 13:38.680]  Flo.
[13:38.680 --> 13:40.680]  I had to put my Arise pollen on the Flo.
[13:40.680 --> 13:41.680]  I did it.
[13:41.680 --> 13:42.680]  I grew it out.
[13:42.680 --> 13:47.480]  I gave a bunch of seeds to a bunch of my friends, and everybody came back with the same reports.
[13:47.480 --> 13:52.560]  They all said, bro, these plants kind of smell like incense and hash and dirty feet,
[13:52.560 --> 13:55.440]  and they all made purple short squatty plants.
[13:55.440 --> 13:56.440]  I was like, I did it.
[13:56.440 --> 13:58.920]  That is exactly what I wanted.
[13:58.920 --> 14:04.880]  Let's talk a little bit about what I think the flavors and aromas of Flo smell like.
[14:04.880 --> 14:09.520]  One time I was in Boston and I went to a store on Newbury Street.
[14:09.520 --> 14:12.120]  I do not remember the name of that store.
[14:12.120 --> 14:14.920]  My buddy Robbie called it the Hindu store.
[14:14.920 --> 14:18.080]  I do not know if that is racist or not, but that is what it was.
[14:18.080 --> 14:21.940]  They had all kinds of Hindu stuff in there.
[14:21.940 --> 14:23.480]  You guys know the store I am talking about.
[14:23.480 --> 14:25.720]  There is one in every hip city.
[14:25.720 --> 14:30.680]  It smelled like way too much incense, and it also smelled like they were cooking some
[14:30.680 --> 14:36.640]  very ethnic food, but it also smelled like somebody in there needed a fucking shower.
[14:36.640 --> 14:41.800]  That is very much what I think Prana smells like, which is what part of led me to the
[14:41.800 --> 14:42.800]  name Prana.
[14:43.200 --> 14:46.720]  It smells like the fucking yoga studio in Boulder.
[14:46.720 --> 14:48.600]  It smells really nice, like some incense.
[14:48.600 --> 14:55.360]  It smells like maybe some good tea or something, maybe some Thai food or something like that
[14:55.360 --> 14:59.800]  in the background, but then also it just smells like somebody needs to wash their ass, but
[14:59.800 --> 15:01.760]  it is so good for some reason.
[15:01.760 --> 15:07.240]  I know it sounds disgusting, but the most disgusting cannabis aromas always translate
[15:07.240 --> 15:10.280]  to the best smoke is what I have noticed.
[15:10.280 --> 15:15.520]  It smells like incense and armpits and a little bit of Thai food or ethnic food, but
[15:15.520 --> 15:16.600]  it is so wonderful.
[15:16.600 --> 15:20.160]  It is dominated by the power of that incense.
[15:20.160 --> 15:24.600]  Then the second smell is, I do not know, body odor or feet or something.
[15:24.600 --> 15:28.440]  Then it is also like they were cooking something ethnic in the background.
[15:28.440 --> 15:31.640]  That is the flavor and aroma of Prana.
[15:31.640 --> 15:34.320]  Some phenotypes have a little bit of skunk to them.
[15:34.320 --> 15:38.280]  Some phenotypes have a little bit of hint of berries and feet, but most of the phenotypes
[15:38.280 --> 15:41.640]  are going to be dominated by that incense and body odor.
[15:41.640 --> 15:46.680]  Then maybe like somebody is cooking some ethnic food in the background, but everybody who
[15:46.680 --> 15:51.360]  has grown this, everybody who has sampled it, everybody who has reported back to me
[15:51.360 --> 15:56.560]  has used the word unique in their descriptions of the flavors and aromas.
[15:56.560 --> 16:02.160]  It is very unique, but I think it smells just like the Hindu shop on Newbury Street in Boston,
[16:02.160 --> 16:03.160]  Massachusetts.
[16:03.160 --> 16:04.480]  Everybody, let us take a field trip.
[16:04.760 --> 16:07.160]  Let us all meet up at the Hindu shop on Newbury Street.
[16:07.160 --> 16:11.080]  We will walk in there and go, and we will go, oh, that is what it smells like.
[16:11.080 --> 16:13.200]  We will high five and we will all come back home.
[16:13.200 --> 16:14.600]  I will see you guys there tomorrow.
[16:14.600 --> 16:15.600]  All right.
[16:15.600 --> 16:17.920]  Now let us talk more about the buzz.
[16:17.920 --> 16:21.120]  The buzz from Prana is not overwhelming.
[16:21.120 --> 16:26.280]  Some of my strains are quite potent and can kind of put some beginner smokers into a panic
[16:26.280 --> 16:30.840]  attack or stick you to the couch or make you want to call your mom for help.
[16:30.840 --> 16:34.200]  Prana is not going to do that to you in most cases.
[16:34.920 --> 16:37.720]  Prana is going to give you a nice, smooth head buzz.
[16:37.720 --> 16:39.840]  You are probably going to talk too much.
[16:39.840 --> 16:42.920]  You might want to do some painting or do whatever type of art you do.
[16:42.920 --> 16:46.960]  You may need to grab a guitar and just strum out a few chords and write that new tune.
[16:46.960 --> 16:51.640]  I feel like most of the time, Prana is a very uplifting and happy sort of a buzz.
[16:51.640 --> 16:55.960]  I feel like that trait from the flow, that happiness and that smiles and that good morning
[16:55.960 --> 17:00.280]  vibe and that social vibe, I think that really translated from the flow and that came over
[17:00.280 --> 17:02.640]  into this cross quite nicely.
[17:02.640 --> 17:04.200]  I think it puts me in a good mood.
[17:04.200 --> 17:06.280]  I think it's really, it's kind of energizing.
[17:06.280 --> 17:09.720]  It's not too energizing to where you're going to be wired and want to run around, but it's
[17:09.720 --> 17:10.720]  really uplifting.
[17:10.720 --> 17:12.160]  It'll put a smile on your face.
[17:12.160 --> 17:16.200]  It's kind of like a cup of coffee and whatever else you are taking these days to enhance
[17:16.200 --> 17:17.200]  your mood.
[17:17.200 --> 17:19.800]  It's kind of like that, just in a bowl form.
[17:19.800 --> 17:21.460]  So that is the aroma.
[17:21.460 --> 17:22.520]  That is the flavor.
[17:22.520 --> 17:23.520]  That's the buzz.
[17:23.520 --> 17:28.800]  Let's talk more about the actual growth characteristics of this plant.
[17:28.840 --> 17:33.360]  When you grow Prana, you'll know that it doesn't get as tall as many of my other crosses.
[17:33.360 --> 17:36.480]  Some of my crosses will get really tall and lanky.
[17:36.480 --> 17:41.960]  Prana is known to stay a little bit shorter and get a little bit wider and stockier.
[17:41.960 --> 17:48.680]  You can expect some phenotypes of Prana to potentially double in height during flower.
[17:48.680 --> 17:51.520]  Now I know I said it's not as tall as some of my plants.
[17:51.520 --> 17:53.920]  Some will triple in height and flower.
[17:53.920 --> 17:56.920]  This one won't grow as rapidly in flower.
[17:57.040 --> 17:59.360]  That 21 day stretch is not extreme.
[17:59.360 --> 18:03.760]  So it will stay a little bit shorter and if you top it or if you give it some love, it
[18:03.760 --> 18:07.000]  will branch out and get quite wide.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.400]  This plant really likes being trellised.
[18:09.400 --> 18:11.440]  It likes screen of green type stuff.
[18:11.440 --> 18:15.840]  It really takes well to being popped and twist and defoliated.
[18:15.840 --> 18:19.800]  It can take all of the abuse you want to throw at it.
[18:19.800 --> 18:26.100]  You can expect many phenotypes of Prana to finish at the end of week eight, but some
[18:26.180 --> 18:31.940]  may take longer because King Solomon is a longer finishing plant.
[18:31.940 --> 18:34.100]  That Arise can go nine or ten weeks.
[18:34.100 --> 18:37.220]  So that trait does carry to some phenotypes.
[18:37.220 --> 18:41.420]  There will be outliers that will finish in the middle of week seven and the start of
[18:41.420 --> 18:46.500]  week eight, but you can count on some end of week eighters and end of week nine plants
[18:46.500 --> 18:47.500]  for sure.
[18:47.500 --> 18:52.540]  But there will be outliers both directions because the parents of these are vastly different
[18:52.540 --> 18:54.420]  flowering times.
[18:54.420 --> 18:58.740]  Something I have found when I've grown a lot of these plants is the thinner leaved
[18:58.740 --> 19:02.620]  phenotypes are obviously the Arise dominant plants.
[19:02.620 --> 19:06.780]  They're going to take longer when those plants start getting taller and thinner.
[19:06.780 --> 19:10.120]  Those are obviously going to be your longer flowering phenotypes.
[19:10.120 --> 19:14.980]  The short one with the really wide leaves, it gets maroon right up the petioles really
[19:14.980 --> 19:15.980]  early.
[19:15.980 --> 19:18.900]  That is the early finishing phenotype.
[19:18.900 --> 19:22.860]  Basically the wider leaves, the earlier this plant is going to finish.
[19:22.860 --> 19:25.460]  Prana is basically an easy plant to grow.
[19:25.460 --> 19:28.080]  She's one of my most simple plants to grow.
[19:28.080 --> 19:30.260]  That's why I recommend her for beginners.
[19:30.260 --> 19:35.580]  She is in my top three for recommendations for beginner growers, as well as my top three
[19:35.580 --> 19:36.940]  for my outdoor strains.
[19:36.940 --> 19:40.520]  So if you want outdoor stuff or if you're a new grower, Prana is one of the strains
[19:40.520 --> 19:41.520]  to grab.
[19:41.520 --> 19:42.860]  That is one of my recommendations.
[19:42.860 --> 19:44.660]  She is fairly easy to grow.
[19:44.660 --> 19:45.860]  She could take abuse.
[19:45.860 --> 19:47.020]  She's quite vigorous.
[19:47.020 --> 19:49.000]  She bounces back if you do mess her up.
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.780]  She can take feeding mistakes.
[19:50.780 --> 19:51.820]  She grows very well.
[19:51.820 --> 19:55.700]  She'll give you a generous harvest, even if you do have some problems with her.
[19:55.700 --> 19:57.940]  The outcome is always quality.
[19:57.940 --> 20:01.780]  A lot of people think that a plant that is very forgiving may not be high quality.
[20:01.780 --> 20:03.240]  That is not true with this one.
[20:03.240 --> 20:08.080]  She will still put out high quality, even if you do have a couple of small mistakes.
[20:08.080 --> 20:10.180]  She really does like it if you spread her out.
[20:10.180 --> 20:12.160]  She likes to become a wide plant.
[20:12.160 --> 20:13.160]  You could trellis her.
[20:13.160 --> 20:14.160]  You could screen her out.
[20:14.160 --> 20:16.220]  You can use a tomato cage and stretch it out.
[20:16.220 --> 20:18.260]  She really likes that sort of stuff.
[20:18.260 --> 20:20.780]  She really enjoys being cleaned up on the bottoms.
[20:20.780 --> 20:24.580]  If you take all that crap up off the bottom, the plant will grow up toward the top and
[20:24.580 --> 20:29.780]  really give you a lot better, more dense top buds if you clean up the bottoms.
[20:29.780 --> 20:34.980]  Another great thing I should mention about Prana is she is very resistant to mold and
[20:34.980 --> 20:35.980]  mildew.
[20:35.980 --> 20:38.300]  I have never had bud rot in a Prana plant.
[20:38.300 --> 20:41.620]  I've never seen powdery mildew on a Prana plant.
[20:41.620 --> 20:48.340]  I also mentioned earlier that the spider mites tend to stay away from the flow and the Prana.
[20:48.340 --> 20:53.740]  There's something about that dirty feet, that nog chomp sort of a smell that the spider
[20:53.740 --> 20:56.780]  mites just go, bro, I don't even want to go over there.
[20:56.780 --> 21:01.900]  You may find that the spider mites avoid your Prana plants if you've got other plants with
[21:01.900 --> 21:03.020]  spider mites on them.
[21:03.020 --> 21:07.960]  I'm not encouraging you to get mites to try it, but it's something you may discover.
[21:07.960 --> 21:12.580]  One of the best things about Prana, which I mentioned earlier, is she is an early finisher.
[21:12.580 --> 21:14.740]  Some of those phenotypes will be done at week eight.
[21:14.740 --> 21:18.740]  It is always nice to get a crop down, especially if you're growing outdoors.
[21:18.740 --> 21:22.920]  Your crop is harvested and indoors and safe and secure while everybody else still has
[21:22.920 --> 21:24.260]  two weeks to go.
[21:24.260 --> 21:28.740]  Yours is dried and cured and ready for market while everybody else still has time to go.
[21:28.740 --> 21:30.180]  That puts you ahead of the game.
[21:30.180 --> 21:32.100]  It also puts you ahead of the thieves.
[21:32.100 --> 21:33.660]  It puts you ahead of the frost.
[21:33.660 --> 21:36.140]  It puts you ahead of potential problems.
[21:36.140 --> 21:42.460]  Getting a crop down, dried and secured earlier than everybody else is a huge advantage.
[21:42.460 --> 21:48.860]  When you come to one of the best traits of Prana is when you smoke it, it is very satisfying.
[21:48.860 --> 21:50.180]  It smells amazing.
[21:50.180 --> 21:51.460]  It tastes amazing.
[21:51.460 --> 21:53.260]  Then it brings a beautiful buzz.
[21:53.260 --> 21:57.780]  You can't help but just sit there and smile and enjoy how stoned you are and how perfect
[21:57.780 --> 22:00.340]  that uplifting, goofy buzz is.
[22:00.340 --> 22:03.020]  Let's talk a little bit more about growing this plant.
[22:03.020 --> 22:04.120]  It gets bushy.
[22:04.120 --> 22:05.120]  It gets wide.
[22:05.120 --> 22:09.120]  You can expect it to double in height by the time it is done flowering.
[22:09.120 --> 22:13.000]  You may need some supports because you're going to get fat, chunky buds.
[22:13.000 --> 22:14.120]  You'll have stout plants.
[22:14.120 --> 22:19.600]  It should have big, fat branches, but hopefully those buds are huge and you need some sort
[22:19.600 --> 22:20.600]  of support.
[22:20.600 --> 22:22.020]  So plan on trellising.
[22:22.020 --> 22:23.020]  Plan on tomato cages.
[22:23.020 --> 22:25.520]  I really don't like a bunch of stakes in the grow room.
[22:25.520 --> 22:26.520]  They're dangerous.
[22:26.520 --> 22:30.240]  If you get those wooden stakes and you run them a couple times in your grow, if you crack
[22:30.240 --> 22:32.280]  them open, you'll see they're just filled with crap.
[22:32.280 --> 22:33.920]  There's possibly mold in there.
[22:33.920 --> 22:37.800]  If you had any bugs, those bugs laid eggs inside of those sticks.
[22:37.800 --> 22:40.200]  I would recommend getting away from the wooden stakes.
[22:40.200 --> 22:45.480]  If you insist on using stakes in your grow, I recommend the green or red washable and
[22:45.480 --> 22:46.480]  replaceable stakes.
[22:46.480 --> 22:49.600]  That way you can clean them and make sure they're not getting mold inside.
[22:49.600 --> 22:52.880]  You can spray them down with a pesticide, make sure they don't have bugs all over them.
[22:52.880 --> 22:55.120]  But again, I prefer not to use stakes.
[22:55.120 --> 22:58.820]  They're dangerous and there are much more efficient methods, but you're going to need
[22:58.820 --> 23:01.760]  some sort of support for these big buds.
[23:01.760 --> 23:04.960]  Hopefully you'll see some beautiful, colorful plants.
[23:05.120 --> 23:09.960]  Now let's talk about how to bring out some of those colors, temperatures.
[23:09.960 --> 23:13.000]  Late in flower, get it a little bit cold.
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.920]  That will really bring out the color of these prana plants.
[23:16.920 --> 23:19.000]  That comes from DJ Short's Flow.
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.240]  That Flow really turns beautiful colors.
[23:21.240 --> 23:26.240]  If you get them cold late in flower, you will really bring out those purples and reds.
[23:26.240 --> 23:31.840]  Also some kelp products will bring out the colors and the kelp products also seem to
[23:31.960 --> 23:35.960]  enhance that funky stank aroma from this plant.
[23:35.960 --> 23:38.200]  Let's talk more about feeding prana.
[23:38.200 --> 23:40.200]  Prana likes to eat.
[23:40.200 --> 23:43.720]  You can feed the shit out of your prana plants.
[23:43.720 --> 23:47.640]  The Flow parent is a semi heavy feeder.
[23:47.640 --> 23:52.920]  The Golden Goat on the other side of the parental line is a very heavy feeder.
[23:52.920 --> 23:57.400]  Many of these phenotypes will be able to eat very high PPMs.
[23:57.400 --> 24:01.400]  I'm not encouraging you to burn the plants from the very beginning, but start pushing
[24:01.960 --> 24:02.960]  them.
[24:02.960 --> 24:06.520]  I recommend pushing them until you start seeing the leaf tips burn just a little bit.
[24:06.520 --> 24:10.080]  You can either stick with that much nutrient or dial it back just a little.
[24:10.080 --> 24:15.840]  But I really feel like prana can take a heavy feeding if you are careful and you know what
[24:15.840 --> 24:16.840]  you're giving her.
[24:16.840 --> 24:19.600]  Now keep in mind these plants do finish early.
[24:19.600 --> 24:23.360]  So if you're going to boost them up with a lot of nutrients, you have to save yourself
[24:23.360 --> 24:25.320]  plenty of time for flushing.
[24:25.320 --> 24:30.620]  So she can be a heavy feeder, but don't forget to schedule your flush early because these
[24:30.840 --> 24:35.860]  plants may finish earlier than you're anticipating and they may be done earlier than the rest
[24:35.860 --> 24:37.640]  of the plants in your garden.
[24:37.640 --> 24:39.420]  So overall, she is a heavy feeder.
[24:39.420 --> 24:43.640]  She can take the nitrogen, she can take the potassium, she can take the phosphorus.
[24:43.640 --> 24:45.740]  She may need some cow mag.
[24:45.740 --> 24:48.060]  She does have Golden Goat in her genetics.
[24:48.060 --> 24:52.340]  Anybody that messes with Golden Goat knows that plant likes to get nutrient deficient
[24:52.340 --> 24:53.680]  really quickly.
[24:53.680 --> 24:56.460]  So prana may need some extra nutrients.
[24:56.460 --> 24:57.880]  Pay attention to her.
[24:57.880 --> 25:04.320]  I have also noticed that you can lower the pH of prana and she will respond very well.
[25:04.320 --> 25:09.400]  Lower pH will usually bring out some aromas and some different funks and some cool colors
[25:09.400 --> 25:11.720]  in many phenotypes of prana.
[25:11.720 --> 25:16.360]  Now you've got to keep in mind that some of these things are phenotype dependent.
[25:16.360 --> 25:21.320]  Also these things are dependent on your environment, your room, your feed, your equipment.
[25:21.320 --> 25:26.680]  These are all generalizations on things I have seen in my rooms and in my tester rooms
[25:26.680 --> 25:29.560]  from growing large populations of these plants.
[25:29.560 --> 25:31.760]  Your setup may be different.
[25:31.760 --> 25:34.300]  We'll talk about specific phenotypes in just a minute.
[25:34.300 --> 25:39.440]  But for most of what I've seen, this is the easiest plant to grow in my lineup.
[25:39.440 --> 25:43.200]  Some of the seeds I have put out are for more advanced growers.
[25:43.200 --> 25:46.560]  Some beginner growers may have some struggles figuring out what's going on with some of
[25:46.560 --> 25:47.560]  my plants.
[25:47.560 --> 25:48.560]  They get tall really quickly.
[25:48.560 --> 25:49.880]  They get out of hand.
[25:49.880 --> 25:50.960]  People may panic.
[25:50.960 --> 25:53.800]  This one is very easy to grow.
[25:53.800 --> 25:56.380]  Most phenotypes of prana are going to be very forgiving.
[25:57.080 --> 25:59.440]  So if you do make a mistake, the plants will bounce right back.
[25:59.440 --> 26:02.700]  And another great thing is they don't take a real long time to flower.
[26:02.700 --> 26:05.060]  So if you do make a mistake, they're almost done.
[26:05.060 --> 26:06.580]  You get to start another crop.
[26:06.580 --> 26:10.040]  You get to try again and you don't get too far behind schedule.
[26:10.040 --> 26:12.980]  I think these plants will do great in an indoor environment.
[26:12.980 --> 26:15.900]  I think they do great in most outdoor environments.
[26:15.900 --> 26:19.500]  I can't say these plants are going to grow great everywhere, but I've gotten good reports
[26:19.500 --> 26:22.940]  of them from both coasts and almost everywhere in between.
[26:22.940 --> 26:24.060]  They grew well outdoors.
[26:24.060 --> 26:25.380]  They finished on time.
[26:25.380 --> 26:26.380]  They beat the frost.
[26:26.380 --> 26:27.380]  They didn't get any mildew.
[26:27.380 --> 26:29.380]  They didn't get many bug problems.
[26:29.380 --> 26:32.300]  So that seems to be a good report for outdoor growing.
[26:32.300 --> 26:35.140]  They work wonderfully in indoor grow environments.
[26:35.140 --> 26:37.100]  I bred them in an indoor environment.
[26:37.100 --> 26:39.180]  I've tested them in many indoor environments.
[26:39.180 --> 26:41.180]  They work well under HID lighting.
[26:41.180 --> 26:42.940]  They work well under LEDs.
[26:42.940 --> 26:45.860]  I've seen beautiful results under ceramic metal halides.
[26:45.860 --> 26:48.420]  I think they're great plants in greenhouses.
[26:48.420 --> 26:51.480]  I think this is a great plant for a beginner grower.
[26:51.480 --> 26:55.720]  I really think that an advanced grower will find some beautiful phenotypes and really
[26:55.720 --> 27:02.440]  be able to push this plant to a really great level without spending nine, 10, or 11 weeks
[27:02.440 --> 27:03.720]  flowering something.
[27:03.720 --> 27:06.640]  You'll still reach great potential with prana plants.
[27:06.640 --> 27:11.760]  I really think that King Solomon put a lot of vigor and a lot of potency into this cross.
[27:11.760 --> 27:15.680]  Then I really think that the flow brings that intense, unique aroma.
[27:15.680 --> 27:20.760]  But the combination still gives it potential to be first-class, top-shelf connoisseur smoke,
[27:21.040 --> 27:24.800]  even if it finishes around week seven, eight, or nine.
[27:24.800 --> 27:27.080]  It's a very diverse, very versatile plant.
[27:27.080 --> 27:29.680]  I think the consumers at the end will really enjoy it.
[27:29.680 --> 27:31.960]  I think that patients really enjoy it.
[27:31.960 --> 27:35.880]  Let's talk about some of the phenotypes to look for before we start wrapping up this
[27:35.880 --> 27:37.720]  long, rambly episode.
[27:37.720 --> 27:40.180]  There are a few phenotypes that I have noticed.
[27:40.180 --> 27:44.480]  There is one that is obviously the flow-dominant phenotype.
[27:44.480 --> 27:46.760]  It looks just like you're growing flow.
[27:46.760 --> 27:50.260]  It has a flow, blueberry sort of aroma.
[27:50.260 --> 27:51.860]  It's kind of dark in color.
[27:51.860 --> 27:56.620]  If you've grown flow at all, it is very obvious the flow-dominant phenotype.
[27:56.620 --> 27:59.820]  Then of course there is the arise-dominant phenotype.
[27:59.820 --> 28:00.820]  It is taller.
[28:00.820 --> 28:02.180]  It is skinnier.
[28:02.180 --> 28:07.540]  That phenotype absolutely takes longer than the flow-dominant phenotype.
[28:07.540 --> 28:11.460]  In comparison, the flow-dominant phenotype will stay shorter.
[28:11.460 --> 28:12.460]  It will stay wider.
[28:12.460 --> 28:14.060]  It will stay more squat.
[28:14.060 --> 28:17.340]  It will have thicker branching on the bottom.
[28:17.340 --> 28:19.380]  The bottom branches will be more stout.
[28:19.500 --> 28:23.140]  The arise-dominant phenotype will grow taller more quickly.
[28:23.140 --> 28:29.700]  It will have the branching, but it won't have as many nodes on the branching, if that makes
[28:29.700 --> 28:30.700]  any sense.
[28:30.700 --> 28:33.820]  The nodes will come off, but they won't have as many sub-branches.
[28:33.820 --> 28:38.420]  It looks more like a switch than a bush, if that makes any sense to you.
[28:38.420 --> 28:40.940]  Something that you'd go get for grandma to whip your ass with.
[28:40.940 --> 28:44.260]  The flow-dominant phenotype will not work for that.
[28:44.260 --> 28:46.060]  That's more like swinging a menorah at somebody.
[28:46.060 --> 28:47.100]  Too many branches.
[28:47.100 --> 28:50.900]  The arise-dominant phenotype, I guess you could say, is more like a fishing pole in
[28:50.900 --> 28:55.380]  comparison to the menorah compared to the flow-dominant phenotype.
[28:55.380 --> 28:59.140]  Now, let's move forward to a couple of more phenotypes you may see.
[28:59.140 --> 29:02.820]  There is one that I call the flow-OG phenotype.
[29:02.820 --> 29:05.860]  It is nothing like the flow-OG that's released by another breeder.
[29:05.860 --> 29:11.000]  I just see traits of flow, and then I see Joseph-OG and Chem-D in there.
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.000]  It stays short.
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.140]  It stays squat, but it makes really wide leaves.
[29:15.180 --> 29:17.740]  The leaves on this one get really, really wide.
[29:17.740 --> 29:20.220]  That comes from the daybreaker.
[29:20.220 --> 29:23.820]  Many of the crosses I made with daybreaker have this trait where the leaves are really
[29:23.820 --> 29:26.220]  wide and they like to droop and hang down.
[29:26.220 --> 29:29.780]  No matter how happy that plant is, those leaves won't go up.
[29:29.780 --> 29:33.020]  They are so big that the plant struggles to keep them up.
[29:33.020 --> 29:35.380]  That is just a trait that comes from the daybreaker.
[29:35.380 --> 29:40.140]  I see that in the flow and the OG-dominant phenotype.
[29:40.140 --> 29:43.420]  That is the one that is really purple, really squat.
[29:43.500 --> 29:47.900]  Unfortunately, that one is the smallest of the yielders.
[29:47.900 --> 29:52.900]  She puts out super nice, frosty golf balls that are covered in resin, but unfortunately
[29:52.900 --> 29:55.300]  she doesn't give you a lot of them.
[29:55.300 --> 29:56.380]  You'll still get a good yield.
[29:56.380 --> 30:01.300]  You'll get a nice harvest, but there is a better harvest in that pack of seeds.
[30:01.300 --> 30:05.820]  There is another phenotype that I've seen quite a bit, and I call her the float.
[30:05.820 --> 30:08.260]  It is flow and golden goat.
[30:08.260 --> 30:10.340]  It's got the purple coloring of the flow.
[30:10.340 --> 30:16.380]  It's got that funky aroma of the flow, but it grows tall and it's got very, very distinct
[30:16.380 --> 30:17.460]  golden goat leaves.
[30:17.460 --> 30:19.700]  I've grown golden goat for several years.
[30:19.700 --> 30:23.720]  I can see those leaves, the larger leaves get this crinkle right where they all come
[30:23.720 --> 30:24.720]  out of the petiole.
[30:24.720 --> 30:27.260]  There's this weird crinkle that the golden goat leaves do.
[30:27.260 --> 30:30.260]  I can see that in the float phenotype.
[30:30.260 --> 30:31.900]  It's got the purple petioles.
[30:31.900 --> 30:35.500]  It gets a little bit purple and it gets that smell, but then it gets those golden goat
[30:35.500 --> 30:36.500]  leaves.
[30:36.500 --> 30:37.540]  That's a good phenotype.
[30:37.540 --> 30:42.860]  It is not my favorite phenotype, but the float phenotype is very desirable.
[30:42.860 --> 30:44.380]  She's got many great traits.
[30:44.380 --> 30:45.740]  It's a little head racy.
[30:45.740 --> 30:51.500]  It's a little extra talkative, but it does give you very nice harvests.
[30:51.500 --> 30:56.900]  Now I'm going to talk about my favorite phenotype that I have found that comes very commonly
[30:56.900 --> 31:01.900]  in a pack of prana seeds, but before I do that, I want to make a kind of a reminder
[31:01.900 --> 31:06.300]  or a public service announcement, or I don't even know what it's called, but I talk about
[31:06.420 --> 31:10.820]  phenotypes on this show a lot and then I will get emails from people showing me pictures
[31:10.820 --> 31:15.660]  of their plants saying, hey, is this the float or is this the flow OG phenotype or is this
[31:15.660 --> 31:19.180]  the flow dominant or the arise dominant phenotype?
[31:19.180 --> 31:23.580]  People are really curious about which phenotype they've got compared to the labels I have
[31:23.580 --> 31:27.420]  assigned by seeing a lot of different plants.
[31:27.420 --> 31:30.740]  I think it's really cool that you want to know which phenotype you've got.
[31:30.740 --> 31:31.740]  That makes a lot of sense.
[31:31.740 --> 31:36.260]  Do I have, can I call this the flow dominant or can I call this the arise dominant phenotype?
[31:36.420 --> 31:42.020]  But when you're doing a pheno hunt, don't worry so much about the plants that I like.
[31:42.020 --> 31:45.020]  Worry more about the plants that you like.
[31:45.020 --> 31:49.620]  If you're the grower, focus on the plants that grow the best in your garden, which one
[31:49.620 --> 31:52.340]  performed the best out of that pack of seeds.
[31:52.340 --> 31:53.780]  So take careful notes of that.
[31:53.780 --> 31:54.820]  Which one grew the best?
[31:54.820 --> 31:56.740]  Which one recovered the best from problems?
[31:56.740 --> 31:58.060]  Which one gave me problems?
[31:58.060 --> 31:59.840]  Pay attention to that.
[31:59.840 --> 32:01.420]  Then become the smoker.
[32:01.420 --> 32:04.220]  When you smoke it, which phenotype tasted the best?
[32:04.220 --> 32:06.720]  Which phenotype gave you the best buzz?
[32:06.720 --> 32:10.460]  Which phenotype was your best overall when you smoked it?
[32:10.460 --> 32:14.100]  But try to do these two tests as two separate entities.
[32:14.100 --> 32:18.980]  The grower and the smoker need to separate themselves when you're doing a pheno hunt.
[32:18.980 --> 32:20.180]  So you have grown it.
[32:20.180 --> 32:21.620]  You've got notes from the grow.
[32:21.620 --> 32:23.580]  You know which plant worked the best in your garden.
[32:23.580 --> 32:27.420]  You knew which plant was a pain in the ass that you really don't want to grow again.
[32:27.420 --> 32:29.220]  You've still got clones of all of those.
[32:29.220 --> 32:31.820]  You dry it, you cure it, you smoke it.
[32:31.820 --> 32:34.500]  Then take notes on each phenotype as you smoke it.
[32:34.500 --> 32:35.980]  Find which one is your favorite.
[32:35.980 --> 32:37.300]  There may be one that tastes better.
[32:37.300 --> 32:41.180]  There may be one that gets you more stoned, but there's probably one that you find is
[32:41.180 --> 32:42.180]  your favorite.
[32:42.180 --> 32:46.720]  And you may have to smoke all of them multiple times in multiple situations to realize which
[32:46.720 --> 32:48.900]  one really stands out to you.
[32:48.900 --> 32:52.380]  Or perhaps you're growing for somebody else's medical needs.
[32:52.380 --> 32:56.500]  And now we've got to have them consume this product and see which one works best for their
[32:56.500 --> 32:58.100]  medical needs.
[32:58.100 --> 33:01.560]  Then once you've got plenty of data from the person who is going to consume it, whether
[33:01.560 --> 33:04.720]  it's you, whether it's a medical patient, whether it's if you're going to put it on
[33:04.720 --> 33:08.360]  the black market and make some money off of it, we've got to know how the end consumer
[33:08.360 --> 33:09.600]  responds to it.
[33:09.600 --> 33:14.200]  So once you've got enough feedback there to determine which phenotype is most desirable,
[33:14.200 --> 33:17.940]  then you get to go back to your grow notes and see which plant was your favorite to grow.
[33:17.940 --> 33:20.800]  And do the people really like the one that was easy to grow?
[33:20.800 --> 33:23.840]  Or do the people really like the one that was a pain in the ass to grow?
[33:23.840 --> 33:25.420]  That's when you've got a decision to make.
[33:25.420 --> 33:26.760]  Which plant do I keep now?
[33:26.760 --> 33:28.160]  Now you know how they grow.
[33:28.160 --> 33:29.600]  Now you know how they smoke.
[33:29.640 --> 33:33.120]  And now you can make a decision based on the product and the plant and the phenotype that
[33:33.120 --> 33:37.520]  is appropriate for you instead of trying to find the phenotypes that I have told you are
[33:37.520 --> 33:39.160]  my favorites.
[33:39.160 --> 33:43.880]  We probably like very similar things, but we probably like very different things at
[33:43.880 --> 33:45.160]  the same time.
[33:45.160 --> 33:49.920]  We both like food, but you don't want me deciding your next three meals.
[33:49.920 --> 33:54.840]  I may nail it and decide three perfect meals for you, or I may frustrate you and you may
[33:54.840 --> 33:59.280]  have to eat the worst shit in your opinion for the next three meals.
[33:59.280 --> 34:03.640]  So don't focus too much on the phenotypes that I point out and that I say I like.
[34:03.640 --> 34:05.920]  Find the phenotype that works best for you.
[34:05.920 --> 34:10.800]  The reason I tell you what phenotypes I have seen and what you can expect is just to kind
[34:10.800 --> 34:15.280]  of give you an idea of what to look for and what to expect when you've got these plants.
[34:15.280 --> 34:19.520]  It gives you something to visualize, some sort of landmark, some sort of a base, some
[34:19.520 --> 34:22.360]  sort of a jumping point, something to relate to.
[34:22.360 --> 34:26.960]  I love and appreciate how much you trust me and how much you want to take my advice, but
[34:27.280 --> 34:30.600]  find the phenotypes and the plants that work best for you.
[34:30.600 --> 34:32.060]  Make you happy, please.
[34:32.060 --> 34:33.560]  That's why you've got seeds.
[34:33.560 --> 34:35.280]  That's why you're growing for yourself.
[34:35.280 --> 34:39.720]  Make sure you make the decisions that make you happy in your grow.
[34:39.720 --> 34:44.320]  Now let's talk about the phenotype that I would select for myself if I were growing
[34:44.320 --> 34:46.680]  a pack of prana seeds.
[34:46.680 --> 34:49.640]  I mainly like this phenotype because of the flavor.
[34:49.640 --> 34:54.920]  It has got that perfect incense and kind of a, maybe someone's cooking some Indian food
[34:54.920 --> 34:57.160]  or some Thai food or something in the background.
[34:57.160 --> 35:02.640]  And then it's got just that perfect, perfect aroma of a little bit of foot and ass to it.
[35:02.640 --> 35:06.640]  And I think the combination is deliciously disgusting.
[35:06.640 --> 35:08.620]  And you can tell that's what you've got.
[35:08.620 --> 35:13.080]  About six weeks into the flowering cycle, you'll smell it and you'll go, there's the
[35:13.080 --> 35:16.060]  incense and dirty feet that he was talking about.
[35:16.060 --> 35:19.920]  And I don't think the Thai food or the Indian food, that spicy part, that doesn't really
[35:19.920 --> 35:21.600]  come in until the end.
[35:21.600 --> 35:26.240]  So if you smell incense and feet, I think you are on pace to have the phenotype I am
[35:26.240 --> 35:27.240]  talking about.
[35:27.240 --> 35:32.160]  This one has big leaves, but they are not the big leaves that come from the OG Kush
[35:32.160 --> 35:33.340]  phenotype.
[35:33.340 --> 35:36.260]  They're big, but they are also long and fingery.
[35:36.260 --> 35:38.160]  They are very serrated.
[35:38.160 --> 35:41.480]  And that comes, so the big trait comes from the Daybreaker.
[35:41.480 --> 35:46.800]  The serrations come from the Golden Goat and the basic leaf shape that I'm talking about
[35:46.800 --> 35:48.840]  comes from the Flow.
[35:48.840 --> 35:50.820]  So they are kind of big leaves.
[35:50.820 --> 35:56.180]  They are very long and fingery and very serrated.
[35:56.180 --> 36:00.300]  Sometimes this one has purple petioles and the leaves will start to purple up later in
[36:00.300 --> 36:01.300]  flower.
[36:01.300 --> 36:05.220]  That is a really good indicator that you have got my favorite phenotype.
[36:05.220 --> 36:08.500]  She is kind of short and she grows kind of wide.
[36:08.500 --> 36:11.580]  If you don't top this plant, it will turn into a Christmas tree.
[36:11.580 --> 36:14.020]  It will be shaped just like a Christmas tree.
[36:14.020 --> 36:16.460]  It doesn't have very far nodal spaces.
[36:16.780 --> 36:21.300]  So you'll have a little bit of branch and you'll have a node and then maybe two finger
[36:21.300 --> 36:25.300]  spaces and then another node and two finger spaces and more nodes.
[36:25.300 --> 36:29.140]  You get a lot of node branching out of this phenotype.
[36:29.140 --> 36:32.260]  She is also very leafy is one thing I've noticed.
[36:32.260 --> 36:35.340]  This phenotype is leafier than most of the others.
[36:35.340 --> 36:39.940]  If it looks really bushy, if it's kind of stout, kind of purpley, kind of wide, you
[36:39.940 --> 36:43.700]  are probably on pace to have the phenotype that I'm looking for.
[36:43.700 --> 36:49.300]  My favorite phenotype doesn't make a really ridiculous giant top cola.
[36:49.300 --> 36:53.660]  It has a kind of a menorah shape to it with one bud that sticks up a little bit, but it
[36:53.660 --> 36:58.500]  doesn't have that extreme dominant glory bud like a lot of strains will make.
[36:58.500 --> 37:02.280]  If you do not top it, it will just kind of grow into a Christmas tree with the branches
[37:02.280 --> 37:06.380]  below it just a little bit lower and the branches below that just a little lower.
[37:06.380 --> 37:11.100]  You don't get that extreme different layer of growth from different branches like you
[37:11.100 --> 37:12.980]  do a lot of other strains.
[37:12.980 --> 37:17.300]  I keep using the word menorah because I see everything wanting to grow to the same height.
[37:17.300 --> 37:20.460]  Like you see a menorah, you've got eight tops that are all the same height.
[37:20.460 --> 37:23.620]  That's sort of what this strain will do, but in the middle, you'll have one that gets just
[37:23.620 --> 37:25.260]  a little bit taller.
[37:25.260 --> 37:28.860]  If it's got a lot of light and a lot of nutrients and it's doing really well, sometimes it grows
[37:28.860 --> 37:31.060]  into this beautiful Christmas tree shape.
[37:31.060 --> 37:33.660]  I think it's got a really beautiful structure.
[37:33.660 --> 37:39.260]  For only taking eight weeks to flower, I really think this phenotype gives very generous harvest
[37:39.260 --> 37:40.260]  weights.
[37:40.260 --> 37:41.260]  It's a great plant to work with.
[37:41.660 --> 37:45.940]  Like I said a moment ago, don't focus too much on the phenotypes I talk about.
[37:45.940 --> 37:49.420]  Find the phenotype that works best for you and your garden.
[37:49.420 --> 37:54.820]  One hint that I can give you, the skunkier and fuelier phenotypes are going to be your
[37:54.820 --> 38:02.060]  lower yielding phenotypes and your incense-y, kind of Thai food, Indian food scented phenotypes
[38:02.060 --> 38:07.160]  are going to be your more generously yielding phenotypes.
[38:07.160 --> 38:11.680]  Almost all phenotypes of this plant will give you pretty generous harvest.
[38:11.680 --> 38:17.320]  Also, almost all phenotypes of this plant are going to give you that smiley, happy,
[38:17.320 --> 38:21.360]  shake everybody's hand, high five everybody, skip through the day without a care kind of
[38:21.360 --> 38:22.640]  a buzz.
[38:22.640 --> 38:23.640]  That's my story.
[38:23.640 --> 38:24.640]  I'm sticking to it.
[38:24.640 --> 38:27.480]  That's my breakdown of my strain, prana.
[38:27.480 --> 38:29.320]  That is flow to a rise.
[38:29.320 --> 38:31.560]  I hope you enjoyed my strain report.
[38:31.560 --> 38:35.480]  As soon as I put these episodes out, I start getting emails from people asking, where can
[38:35.480 --> 38:37.720]  I get a pack of prana seeds?
[38:37.720 --> 38:39.320]  That is a great question.
[38:39.320 --> 38:43.600]  The easiest way to find a pack of prana seeds is to find me at the Indo Expo in Denver,
[38:43.600 --> 38:45.960]  Colorado on January 25th and 26th.
[38:45.960 --> 38:47.200]  I will be at booth 533.
[38:47.200 --> 38:54.360]  If you can't make it to the Indo Expo, you can always visit seedsherenow.com and that's
[38:54.360 --> 38:59.640]  obviously at www.seedsherenow.com.
[38:59.640 --> 39:02.480]  Of course, there is the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[39:02.480 --> 39:05.640]  We are at dankseed.store.
[39:05.640 --> 39:08.760]  Then don't forget about our friends, Oregon Elite Seeds.
[39:08.760 --> 39:12.640]  Of course, oregoneliteseeds.com.

[41:36.220 --> 42:05.580]  Transcribed by https://otter.ai
[42:06.220 --> 42:08.220]  They won't help you through
[42:11.220 --> 42:13.220]  All the chance you've got
[42:14.220 --> 42:15.220]  Now you're here
[42:16.220 --> 42:18.220]  Oh, don't smile
[42:19.220 --> 42:22.220]  Used to be one of your brothers
[42:22.220 --> 42:25.220]  Like a blind man in the dark
[42:36.220 --> 42:45.220]  It feels too close for me to meet again
[42:45.220 --> 42:49.220]  But when the room lights are up
[42:51.220 --> 42:55.220]  With a wild angel made up
[42:55.220 --> 42:59.220]  Your phone rings, touch the sky
[43:01.220 --> 43:05.220]  Try to hide, but watch your mouth
[43:05.220 --> 43:09.220]  And you fall down to your knees
[43:11.220 --> 43:15.220]  All I ask from you, my friend
[43:15.220 --> 43:19.220]  Is that you ask nothing from me
[43:20.220 --> 43:25.220]  Dreams fly by like a thousand little warm dreams
[43:26.220 --> 43:30.220]  Egos steadfast like mountains in our brains
[43:31.220 --> 43:34.220]  Those of us who let go can be swallowed
[43:35.220 --> 43:37.220]  And left here to die
[43:39.220 --> 43:41.220]  Do not look to the sky
[43:41.220 --> 43:44.220]  It will not rain for you
[43:46.220 --> 43:49.220]  Do not look to strangers
[43:49.220 --> 43:52.220]  They won't help you through
[43:54.220 --> 43:56.220]  All the chance you've got
[43:57.220 --> 43:59.220]  Now you're here
[43:59.220 --> 44:01.220]  Oh, don't smile
[44:02.220 --> 44:05.220]  Used to be one of your brothers
[44:05.220 --> 44:08.220]  Like a blind man in the dark
[44:31.220 --> 44:33.220]  Do not look to the sky
[44:33.220 --> 44:36.220]  It will not rain for you
[44:37.220 --> 44:39.220]  Do not look to strangers
[44:39.220 --> 44:42.220]  They won't help you through

[44:48.220 --> 44:52.220]  Used to be one of your brothers
[44:52.220 --> 45:05.370]  Like a blind man in the dark
[45:05.370 --> 45:26.190]  It feels too close for me to meet again
[45:26.190 --> 45:28.190]  Oh, don't smile
[45:28.190 --> 45:32.190]  Used to be one of your brothers
[45:32.190 --> 45:35.190]  Like a blind man in the dark

[45:41.190 --> 45:46.850]  Used to be one of your brothers
[45:46.850 --> 45:55.410]  Like a blind man in the dark
[45:55.410 --> 45:59.410]  It feels too close for me to meet again
[45:59.410 --> 46:01.410]  Oh, don't smile
[46:01.410 --> 46:03.410]  Do not look to strangers
[46:03.410 --> 46:06.410]  They won't help you through
[46:08.410 --> 46:11.410]  All the chance you've got
[46:11.410 --> 46:13.410]  Now you're here
[46:13.410 --> 46:16.410]  Oh, don't smile
[46:16.410 --> 46:19.410]  Used to be one of your brothers
[46:19.410 --> 46:22.410]  Like a blind man
[46:22.410 --> 46:25.410]  Blind man in the dark
[46:31.410 --> 46:36.410]  Blind man in the dark
