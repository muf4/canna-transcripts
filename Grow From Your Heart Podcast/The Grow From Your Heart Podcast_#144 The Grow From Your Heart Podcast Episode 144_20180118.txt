[00:17.720 --> 00:23.720]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community. It's time for episode number 144 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.720 --> 00:26.720]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:26.720 --> 00:31.720]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.720 --> 00:35.720]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.720 --> 00:38.720]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:38.720 --> 00:42.720]  I'm your host, my friends, call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys once again for joining me.
[00:42.720 --> 00:47.720]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:47.720 --> 00:51.720]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.720 --> 00:56.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to the show, the traveling stoner. Welcome, Lindsay.
[00:56.720 --> 00:57.720]  Hi, how are you?
[00:57.720 --> 00:58.720]  I'm great. How about yourself?
[00:58.720 --> 00:59.720]  I'm doing good.
[00:59.720 --> 01:01.720]  You look all high. You got a beautiful smile. Thanks for joining us.
[01:01.720 --> 01:07.720]  Thank you. Yeah, I'm super stoned today, actually. I've eaten close to like 500 milligrams today.
[01:07.720 --> 01:10.720]  So bear with me, I guess, today.
[01:10.720 --> 01:11.720]  And I heard you took a little nap.
[01:11.720 --> 01:12.720]  Yeah.
[01:12.720 --> 01:16.720]  Thanks for getting out of bed to come hang out with us. We appreciate it. The listeners like having you here.
[01:16.720 --> 01:18.720]  Thank you for having me.
[01:18.720 --> 01:23.720]  Directly in front of me is the man, the myth, the legend of Mr. Bobo Blastico, also known as Chris.
[01:23.720 --> 01:24.720]  Hello.
[01:24.720 --> 01:25.720]  Thanks for joining us, bro.
[01:25.720 --> 01:26.720]  Thank you for having me here.
[01:26.720 --> 01:27.720]  Dude, how was Portugal?
[01:27.720 --> 01:28.720]  It was amazing.
[01:28.720 --> 01:30.720]  Did you do any Portuguese drugs?
[01:30.720 --> 01:33.720]  I did not. I did not. I actually finally got asked for it.
[01:33.720 --> 01:38.720]  I wish you guys could, I'm turning down the music. I wish you guys could see the look of disappointment in my face.
[01:38.720 --> 01:40.720]  You were in Portugal where everything is legal.
[01:40.720 --> 01:42.720]  I was with my mom and my stepdad.
[01:42.720 --> 01:47.720]  So like, actually, you know what? I was with my mom when I got offered hash.
[01:47.720 --> 01:49.720]  And my mom was like, oh, well, what did that guy over there?
[01:49.720 --> 01:52.720]  I was like, oh, the guy with the polo shirt offered me hash.
[01:52.720 --> 01:56.720]  So, and I was like, your shit sucks. No, I got it right.
[01:56.720 --> 01:59.720]  Like you got some BHO, bro. You got some Turpex over here.
[01:59.720 --> 02:02.720]  He's like, hashish, hashish. And I was like, no, I'm good. Thanks, man.
[02:02.720 --> 02:04.720]  All right. Well, I'm glad you made it back.
[02:04.720 --> 02:06.720]  Yes, yes, I'm happy to be back.
[02:06.720 --> 02:08.720]  I'm just disappointed that you didn't try any Portuguese drugs.
[02:08.720 --> 02:09.720]  Yeah, no.
[02:09.720 --> 02:10.720]  How was Florida?
[02:10.720 --> 02:11.720]  Hot.
[02:11.720 --> 02:12.720]  Hot in Florida.
[02:12.720 --> 02:14.720]  That awesome Florida-ish.
[02:14.720 --> 02:16.720]  Soup feeling, soup balls.
[02:16.720 --> 02:17.720]  Yeah.
[02:17.720 --> 02:19.720]  I see you brought a hot date back from Florida with you.
[02:19.720 --> 02:22.720]  Yes, yes, my four-legged awesomeness.
[02:22.720 --> 02:23.720]  What's the dog's name again?
[02:23.720 --> 02:24.720]  Layla.
[02:24.720 --> 02:25.720]  Layla, beautiful dog. Welcome home, Layla.
[02:25.720 --> 02:26.720]  Yes, yes.
[02:26.720 --> 02:27.720]  I'm glad you're back, bro.
[02:27.720 --> 02:28.720]  Thank you, thank you.
[02:28.720 --> 02:29.720]  Dabs, dabs.
[02:29.720 --> 02:32.720]  To my left, my nine o'clock-ish position, you guys, you know who he is.
[02:32.720 --> 02:33.720]  It's the Bramble King.
[02:33.720 --> 02:34.720]  What's up, everybody?
[02:34.720 --> 02:35.720]  White Mike is back on the show.
[02:35.720 --> 02:36.720]  Thanks for joining me, brother.
[02:36.720 --> 02:37.720]  Yeah, man.
[02:37.720 --> 02:38.720]  Always.
[02:38.720 --> 02:39.720]  It's going to be a great show.
[02:39.720 --> 02:41.720]  I think everyone is perfectly high for this episode.
[02:41.720 --> 02:42.720]  Thoroughly baked.
[02:42.720 --> 02:44.720]  Sometimes we're a little too dabbed.
[02:44.720 --> 02:45.720]  Sometimes we're not dabbed enough.
[02:45.720 --> 02:46.720]  Sometimes I've had too much caffeine.
[02:46.720 --> 02:47.720]  I think we're doing all right tonight.
[02:47.720 --> 02:49.720]  This is going to be a good fucking show.
[02:49.720 --> 02:50.720]  Welcome, everybody.
[02:50.720 --> 02:52.720]  We're going to settle in and do a podcast.
[02:52.720 --> 02:56.720]  The main beef of this podcast, the main heart and soul is going to be,
[02:56.720 --> 02:58.720]  somebody sent me an email and they wanted to know,
[02:58.720 --> 03:00.720]  since a lot of our friends here work in dispensaries
[03:00.720 --> 03:03.720]  and I've been in a dispensary environment for the past several years,
[03:03.720 --> 03:04.720]  we got a question.
[03:05.720 --> 03:08.720]  They want to know about what's the craziest shit we have ever seen in a
[03:08.720 --> 03:10.720]  dispensary or at a smoke event.
[03:10.720 --> 03:13.720]  But before we get to that, I want to do a couple of emails.
[03:13.720 --> 03:17.720]  Let's do Kip's first because his name is Kip and that's cool as fuck.
[03:17.720 --> 03:20.720]  I've never met anybody in person whose name was Kip, I don't think.
[03:20.720 --> 03:21.720]  That's a cool name.
[03:21.720 --> 03:23.720]  You've got to be cool as shit if your name is Kip.
[03:23.720 --> 03:24.720]  That means you've got cool parents.
[03:24.720 --> 03:26.720]  Kip, shout out to Kip.
[03:26.720 --> 03:27.720]  I found Kip on Facebook.
[03:27.720 --> 03:29.720]  He sent me a message that says,
[03:29.720 --> 03:32.720]  I have some plants that I need that I had a friend take care of during a
[03:32.720 --> 03:35.720]  trip and even though on average he's a decent grower,
[03:35.720 --> 03:38.720]  he put my 10-inch plants with his that were a few feet high and didn't raise
[03:38.720 --> 03:42.720]  them up and they were severely stretched, almost 8 inches between nodes.
[03:42.720 --> 03:45.720]  He said, on average, I'd waste them and start new stock,
[03:45.720 --> 03:48.720]  but I'm currently out of seeds and clones due to the trip and I don't have
[03:48.720 --> 03:51.720]  any good candidates for clones other than the tops of the plants.
[03:51.720 --> 03:52.720]  There's your answer right there, bro.
[03:52.720 --> 03:56.720]  He goes on to say, if it wasn't the last of the genetics I had,
[03:56.720 --> 03:58.720]  I'd waste them or pull the tops and clone it,
[03:58.720 --> 04:02.720]  but I'm wondering if you had any quick ways to maybe get a plant to put out
[04:02.720 --> 04:04.720]  some shoots so I have something to clip.
[04:04.720 --> 04:10.720]  The clone I'm running 600 watt HPS at the time, age old newts in dirt.
[04:10.720 --> 04:12.720]  I usually use Nectar of the Gods,
[04:12.720 --> 04:15.720]  but I can't see spending a fortune to raise these plants.
[04:15.720 --> 04:16.720]  Any help would be appreciated.
[04:16.720 --> 04:20.720]  You can put them into bigger pots and top them and they'll start shooting out
[04:20.720 --> 04:21.720]  more shoots.
[04:21.720 --> 04:24.720]  Give them a high phosphorus diet with a lot of nitrogen and phosphorus.
[04:24.720 --> 04:25.720]  They'll spit out more shoots.
[04:25.720 --> 04:28.720]  There's a product called Bushmaster that will make them shoot out more shoots,
[04:28.720 --> 04:29.720]  put them into bigger pots,
[04:29.720 --> 04:32.720]  feed them a good diet and they'll shoot out more shoots.
[04:32.720 --> 04:33.720]  Give them plenty of light,
[04:33.720 --> 04:34.720]  give them plenty of space,
[04:34.720 --> 04:35.720]  top them,
[04:35.720 --> 04:36.720]  do some topping and pinching techniques.
[04:36.720 --> 04:40.720]  But your main answer to your question is what's left.
[04:40.720 --> 04:41.720]  There's the tops of those plants.
[04:41.720 --> 04:42.720]  Clone those bro.
[04:42.720 --> 04:43.720]  Clone those right away.
[04:43.720 --> 04:46.720]  Get those healthy tops cloned in a cloner labeled,
[04:46.720 --> 04:49.720]  get them rooted and then take really good care of those new clones.
[04:49.720 --> 04:51.720]  That's the solution for that.
[04:51.720 --> 04:53.720]  Kip, I appreciate the message on Facebook.
[04:53.720 --> 04:54.720]  If you have any more questions,
[04:54.720 --> 04:59.720]  please send them to me on Facebook or hit me up at grow from your heart at
[04:59.720 --> 05:04.720]  hotmail.com and I will read your messages on the show.
[05:04.720 --> 05:05.720]  All right,
[05:05.720 --> 05:06.720]  I'm searching for an email I've got.
[05:06.720 --> 05:08.720]  We're going to do one more email and then we're going to talk about the crazy
[05:08.720 --> 05:11.720]  shit that these folks have seen in dispensaries.
[05:11.720 --> 05:13.720]  Everyone's looking at me like I want to talk about dispensary shit.
[05:13.720 --> 05:14.720]  You guys start thinking about it now.
[05:14.720 --> 05:16.720]  Get your stories brewing in your heads.
[05:16.720 --> 05:18.720]  Some interesting shit you saw at Metamar,
[05:18.720 --> 05:21.720]  some crazy shit that's happened to you over at green and healthy wellness.
[05:21.720 --> 05:24.720]  I'm sure you've been to dispensaries and seen some crazy shit also,
[05:24.720 --> 05:26.720]  Bobo. So get those stories cooking in your head.
[05:26.720 --> 05:28.720]  Can we talk about the smoke shop too?
[05:28.720 --> 05:29.720]  Oh yes,
[05:29.720 --> 05:30.720]  that's all.
[05:30.720 --> 05:31.720]  That's all.
[05:31.720 --> 05:32.720]  Can I get all that stuff?
[05:32.720 --> 05:33.720]  Secret sash cannabis cup.
[05:33.720 --> 05:34.720]  That's all.
[05:34.720 --> 05:35.720]  That's all fair game in this.
[05:35.720 --> 05:36.720]  All right.
[05:36.720 --> 05:37.720]  This email though,
[05:37.720 --> 05:39.720]  this one is,
[05:39.720 --> 05:40.720]  I think I already said his name.
[05:40.720 --> 05:42.720]  I don't know if I was supposed to say his name.
[05:42.720 --> 05:43.720]  I said his name out loud once already.
[05:43.720 --> 05:44.720]  I may have edit that out.
[05:44.720 --> 05:45.720]  He says,
[05:45.720 --> 05:46.720]  well go on Ross to Jeff.
[05:46.720 --> 05:47.720]  First off,
[05:47.720 --> 05:48.720]  I love the podcast.
[05:48.720 --> 05:51.720]  I have all the episodes on stitcher and about a week and I have to wait
[05:51.720 --> 05:54.720]  painfully from week to week for each new episode.
[05:54.720 --> 05:56.720]  I think there are 10 episodes on available on stitcher.
[05:56.720 --> 05:57.720]  So you print it.
[05:57.720 --> 05:58.720]  Yeah.
[05:58.720 --> 05:59.720]  If you go to my website,
[05:59.720 --> 06:00.720]  I read genetics,
[06:00.720 --> 06:01.720]  colorado.com.
[06:01.720 --> 06:04.720]  There are 100 episodes available on there for you.
[06:04.720 --> 06:06.720]  The last hundred episodes are up there.
[06:06.720 --> 06:08.720]  If you want more episodes other than that,
[06:08.720 --> 06:12.720]  send me an email and I will consider sending you files of the shit.
[06:12.720 --> 06:13.720]  That's not up there.
[06:13.720 --> 06:15.720]  I do need to post some of the older stuff.
[06:15.720 --> 06:17.720]  Some stuff that was really useful that is phased out.
[06:17.720 --> 06:19.720]  Like a couple of the episodes were really helpful.
[06:19.720 --> 06:22.720]  Those early episodes had a lot of heavy grow information.
[06:22.720 --> 06:25.720]  I may go throw some of those out like midweek episodes,
[06:25.720 --> 06:26.720]  just as bonus repeats again.
[06:26.720 --> 06:27.720]  All right.
[06:27.720 --> 06:28.720]  But anyway,
[06:28.720 --> 06:30.720]  he says I found that what it,
[06:30.720 --> 06:31.720]  uh,
[06:31.720 --> 06:32.720]  let's see,
[06:32.720 --> 06:33.720]  uh,
[06:33.720 --> 06:34.720]  being from an illegal state of Pennsylvania,
[06:34.720 --> 06:37.720]  I cannot take your advice in the literal sense due to legalities.
[06:37.720 --> 06:38.720]  However,
[06:38.720 --> 06:41.720]  I have found that what is good for the cannabis plant is also good for some
[06:41.720 --> 06:42.720]  vegetable plants,
[06:42.720 --> 06:43.720]  adding organic nutrients,
[06:43.720 --> 06:46.720]  such as compost teas and trimming techniques like lollipop.
[06:46.720 --> 06:48.720]  And you've done wonders for my tomatoes and hot peppers.
[06:48.720 --> 06:50.720]  Keep up the good work.
[06:50.720 --> 06:53.720]  I'm glad that's applicable to your outdoor veggie garden.
[06:53.720 --> 06:54.720]  That's rad.
[06:54.720 --> 06:55.720]  He goes on to say I was,
[06:55.720 --> 06:58.720]  I also welcome the great advice from white Mike on the legal side of
[06:58.720 --> 06:59.720]  things.
[06:59.720 --> 07:00.720]  Recently in Pennsylvania,
[07:00.720 --> 07:03.720]  the Senate house unanimously passed a bill allowing for restricted hemp
[07:03.720 --> 07:05.720]  production for university research.
[07:05.720 --> 07:09.720]  It's currently awaiting the final signature from governor Tom Wolf.
[07:09.720 --> 07:10.720]  I know a dude named Tom Wolf.
[07:10.720 --> 07:11.720]  He also says,
[07:11.720 --> 07:13.720]  I know we are miles behind Colorado,
[07:13.720 --> 07:15.720]  but I guess we need to start somewhere.
[07:15.720 --> 07:18.720]  He continues with my wife and I will have the pleasure of visiting your fine
[07:18.720 --> 07:19.720]  state next week.
[07:19.720 --> 07:20.720]  Uh,
[07:20.720 --> 07:22.720]  that'll probably be by the time this podcast airs.
[07:22.720 --> 07:24.720]  So I'm going to email him before that,
[07:24.720 --> 07:27.720]  but he says we are overjoyed and have been counting down for weeks.
[07:27.720 --> 07:28.720]  Uh,
[07:28.720 --> 07:30.720]  we will of course be flying into Denver,
[07:30.720 --> 07:33.720]  into the Denver area and beginning our venture adventure from there.
[07:33.720 --> 07:34.720]  My first question is,
[07:34.720 --> 07:37.720]  do you have any recommendations for recreational dispensaries in the Denver
[07:37.720 --> 07:38.720]  region?
[07:39.720 --> 07:42.720]  We want to make sure we establish a reputable place with products that are
[07:42.720 --> 07:43.720]  grown from the heart.
[07:43.720 --> 07:44.720]  Uh,
[07:44.720 --> 07:45.720]  then a second question is,
[07:45.720 --> 07:48.720]  do you think you could do an episode on how to troubleshoot and solve
[07:48.720 --> 07:51.720]  different signs of nutrient burn and or nutrient deficiencies?
[07:51.720 --> 07:53.720]  If you have a potassium deficiency,
[07:53.720 --> 07:57.720]  you would see these signs as opposed to nitrogen deficiency,
[07:57.720 --> 07:58.720]  et cetera.
[07:58.720 --> 08:00.720]  I think that would make a great informative episode,
[08:00.720 --> 08:01.720]  bro.
[08:01.720 --> 08:02.720]  That episode is going to happen.
[08:02.720 --> 08:03.720]  Watch ching screenshot of your email.
[08:03.720 --> 08:04.720]  So that I'll remember that.
[08:04.720 --> 08:05.720]  Uh,
[08:05.720 --> 08:06.720]  I will do that episode.
[08:06.720 --> 08:07.720]  That's a really good idea.
[08:07.720 --> 08:08.720]  Then he says,
[08:08.720 --> 08:09.720]  anyway,
[08:09.720 --> 08:10.720]  before I keep rambling,
[08:10.720 --> 08:11.720]  don't worry,
[08:11.720 --> 08:12.720]  bro.
[08:12.720 --> 08:13.720]  We like it when you ramble.
[08:13.720 --> 08:14.720]  I just want to say you are,
[08:14.720 --> 08:15.720]  uh,
[08:15.720 --> 08:16.720]  you are a,
[08:16.720 --> 08:18.720]  you are very good at your career and give great advice.
[08:18.720 --> 08:19.720]  If you are,
[08:19.720 --> 08:21.720]  if you ever have any photography questions,
[08:21.720 --> 08:22.720]  don't hesitate to hit me up.
[08:22.720 --> 08:24.720]  It would be awesome to someday meet you and do some dabs.
[08:24.720 --> 08:25.720]  But until then,
[08:25.720 --> 08:27.720]  give my mom a hug for you best of luck.
[08:27.720 --> 08:28.720]  And then he says,
[08:28.720 --> 08:30.720]  you can just call me fats.
[08:30.720 --> 08:32.720]  If you decide to read this on the air.
[08:32.720 --> 08:33.720]  Well,
[08:33.720 --> 08:34.720]  thanks fats.
[08:34.720 --> 08:35.720]  I will edit your name out there.
[08:35.720 --> 08:36.720]  Thanks bro.
[08:36.720 --> 08:37.720]  I appreciate that.
[08:37.720 --> 08:38.720]  He had two questions for you guys.
[08:38.720 --> 08:39.720]  Uh,
[08:39.720 --> 08:40.720]  he asked about a,
[08:40.720 --> 08:41.720]  uh,
[08:41.720 --> 08:42.720]  a dispensary,
[08:42.720 --> 08:44.720]  a recreational dispensary recommendation in the Denver area.
[08:44.720 --> 08:49.720]  I unfortunately have no clue where to tell you to go because I don't buy recreational cannabis.
[08:49.720 --> 08:55.720]  I grow and then I'm a master grower at a shop where I just go there and pick up flowers on that employee discount and smoke.
[08:55.720 --> 09:01.720]  Those does anybody in the room have a recommendation for a reputable dispensary in the Denver area?
[09:01.720 --> 09:04.720]  Everybody just Google reviews.
[09:04.720 --> 09:05.720]  Honestly,
[09:05.720 --> 09:06.720]  that's your best bet is to,
[09:06.720 --> 09:07.720]  uh,
[09:07.720 --> 09:08.720]  to hop on your,
[09:08.720 --> 09:09.720]  we either the,
[09:09.720 --> 09:13.720]  the clinic is always one of my favorite places to send people.
[09:13.720 --> 09:14.720]  The clinic has a rec side.
[09:14.720 --> 09:15.720]  The clinic is a great place.
[09:15.720 --> 09:16.720]  In my opinion,
[09:16.720 --> 09:17.720]  their flowers are always quality.
[09:17.720 --> 09:20.720]  I can't guarantee anything about the,
[09:20.720 --> 09:21.720]  Oh look,
[09:21.720 --> 09:24.720]  we got a text message from somebody in the other room listening and they say Natty Rams.
[09:24.720 --> 09:26.720]  I was just going to say that.
[09:26.720 --> 09:27.720]  So go to Natty Rams.
[09:27.720 --> 09:28.720]  That's funny.
[09:28.720 --> 09:29.720]  I was just gonna say,
[09:29.720 --> 09:32.720]  the only thing I can really recommend is places I've been.
[09:32.720 --> 09:34.720]  I've been into Natty Rams and it's actually a very,
[09:35.720 --> 09:36.720]  uh,
[09:36.720 --> 09:37.720]  big take green solutions.
[09:37.720 --> 09:40.720]  But like I was gonna say green solutions as well.
[09:40.720 --> 09:46.720]  It's been over a year since I've been into a shop in Denver and I honestly can't remember if the last two were wreck or mad.
[09:46.720 --> 09:47.720]  I would say fly into Denver,
[09:47.720 --> 09:48.720]  uh,
[09:48.720 --> 09:49.720]  get to your hotel,
[09:49.720 --> 09:50.720]  get on your phone,
[09:50.720 --> 09:51.720]  download the weed maps app,
[09:51.720 --> 09:55.720]  and then just look what's near your hotel and then read reviews for a few of those places.
[09:55.720 --> 09:57.720]  And don't hit just one place,
[09:57.720 --> 09:58.720]  bro.
[09:58.720 --> 09:59.720]  Go to a couple of places,
[09:59.720 --> 10:00.720]  uh,
[10:00.720 --> 10:01.720]  check them out,
[10:01.720 --> 10:03.720]  get the experience because every place is going to have a different vibe of some sort.
[10:04.720 --> 10:05.720]  There's going to be different music.
[10:05.720 --> 10:06.720]  Like at the spot,
[10:06.720 --> 10:07.720]  the music is loud.
[10:07.720 --> 10:09.720]  It's reggae in your face.
[10:09.720 --> 10:10.720]  As soon as you get there,
[10:10.720 --> 10:13.720]  it's a real salesy environment.
[10:13.720 --> 10:14.720]  They want you to buy,
[10:14.720 --> 10:15.720]  buy,
[10:15.720 --> 10:16.720]  buy.
[10:16.720 --> 10:18.720]  Things are set up to where it's like impulse buys right where you need them.
[10:18.720 --> 10:20.720]  And it's got that kind of flow to it.
[10:20.720 --> 10:21.720]  Uh,
[10:21.720 --> 10:22.720]  green and healthy.
[10:22.720 --> 10:23.720]  On the other hand,
[10:23.720 --> 10:24.720]  I know the owner,
[10:24.720 --> 10:26.720]  he wanted to set it up more with the art gallery sort of a feel.
[10:26.720 --> 10:28.720]  And it does have that sort of a feel.
[10:28.720 --> 10:29.720]  It's more spread out.
[10:29.720 --> 10:30.720]  It's more spacious.
[10:30.720 --> 10:31.720]  There's artwork everywhere.
[10:31.720 --> 10:34.720]  And so every dispensary and the quality of product from the two shops is
[10:34.720 --> 10:36.720]  amazingly fucking different.
[10:36.720 --> 10:37.720]  And they're just,
[10:37.720 --> 10:39.720]  the selections are different too.
[10:39.720 --> 10:40.720]  I mean,
[10:40.720 --> 10:41.720]  every shop's going to have its own vibe,
[10:41.720 --> 10:42.720]  its own selection,
[10:42.720 --> 10:43.720]  its own way of doing things.
[10:43.720 --> 10:45.720]  And especially if you're from Pennsylvania,
[10:45.720 --> 10:46.720]  it's worth it.
[10:46.720 --> 10:47.720]  And,
[10:47.720 --> 10:48.720]  um,
[10:48.720 --> 10:49.720]  several just to check out the different ones.
[10:49.720 --> 10:51.720]  You're also going to want to make time to hit illusions,
[10:51.720 --> 10:53.720]  glass gallery downtown.
[10:53.720 --> 10:54.720]  Shout out to white Mike.
[10:54.720 --> 10:55.720]  Yeah,
[10:55.720 --> 10:56.720]  you're definitely not to.
[10:56.720 --> 10:57.720]  Yeah.
[10:57.720 --> 10:59.720]  It's somewhere you're going to want to stop.
[11:00.720 --> 11:01.720]  That's just make,
[11:01.720 --> 11:04.720]  make sure it's part of your trip and be careful smoking in your hotel.
[11:04.720 --> 11:05.720]  Uh,
[11:05.720 --> 11:07.720]  you may think that because you're in Colorado now we can smoke out the
[11:07.720 --> 11:08.720]  hotel.
[11:08.720 --> 11:09.720]  Negative negative.
[11:09.720 --> 11:12.720]  Make sure that you've got a marijuana friendly room.
[11:12.720 --> 11:14.720]  And if you're worried about calling and asking the hotel,
[11:14.720 --> 11:17.720]  just call it from your phone and pretend like you're lost or coming next
[11:17.720 --> 11:19.720]  week and want to know what their policy is.
[11:19.720 --> 11:21.720]  They'll be happy to explain it to you.
[11:21.720 --> 11:22.720]  If you're,
[11:22.720 --> 11:23.720]  Oh,
[11:23.720 --> 11:24.720]  sorry.
[11:24.720 --> 11:25.720]  If you're going to,
[11:25.720 --> 11:26.720]  as I say,
[11:26.720 --> 11:28.720]  if you're going to smoke in your room or do something like that,
[11:28.720 --> 11:32.720]  I would highly recommend looking into things like the smoke buddy and,
[11:32.720 --> 11:33.720]  uh,
[11:33.720 --> 11:34.720]  um,
[11:34.720 --> 11:36.720]  the like scented candles from smoke shops,
[11:36.720 --> 11:38.720]  the ones that are actually like ozone.
[11:39.720 --> 11:40.720]  Yeah,
[11:40.720 --> 11:41.720]  for sure.
[11:41.720 --> 11:42.720]  Just go out on the balcony if you can.
[11:42.720 --> 11:43.720]  Yeah.
[11:43.720 --> 11:44.720]  Yeah.
[11:44.720 --> 11:45.720]  But if you,
[11:45.720 --> 11:46.720]  you know,
[11:46.720 --> 11:47.720]  if you set off the smoke alarm,
[11:47.720 --> 11:49.720]  they will charge you the 250 or $500 cleaning fee,
[11:49.720 --> 11:50.720]  depending on how bougie the hotel is.
[11:50.720 --> 11:52.720]  They'll charge you for that shit.
[11:52.720 --> 11:53.720]  But yeah,
[11:53.720 --> 11:54.720]  the smoke buddy,
[11:54.720 --> 11:55.720]  a little vape pen.
[11:55.720 --> 11:56.720]  What's your,
[11:56.720 --> 11:57.720]  aren't you repping a new vape pen company?
[11:57.720 --> 11:58.720]  Yeah.
[11:58.720 --> 11:59.720]  What's the name of that pen?
[11:59.720 --> 12:00.720]  You can shout them out on the show since you're here.
[12:00.720 --> 12:01.720]  Cool.
[12:01.720 --> 12:02.720]  Um,
[12:02.720 --> 12:04.720]  kinetic products is what they are on Instagram.
[12:04.720 --> 12:08.720]  Their website to order stuff will be up and running on the 25th of this month.
[12:08.720 --> 12:09.720]  Um,
[12:09.720 --> 12:10.720]  so,
[12:10.720 --> 12:12.720]  and I don't actually have the exact website for that yet,
[12:12.720 --> 12:15.720]  but you can check them out on Instagram at kinetic products and they have a,
[12:15.720 --> 12:16.720]  um,
[12:16.720 --> 12:19.720]  wax pen that has a quartz coil in it.
[12:19.720 --> 12:22.720]  She's been bragging about it for a little while.
[12:22.720 --> 12:24.720]  Spell kinetic for us,
[12:24.720 --> 12:25.720]  because I think when you say kinetic,
[12:25.720 --> 12:26.720]  I see with a K,
[12:26.720 --> 12:28.720]  but it's the Colorado sea,
[12:28.720 --> 12:29.720]  right?
[12:29.720 --> 12:30.720]  It's C a N N.
[12:30.720 --> 12:31.720]  Oh,
[12:31.720 --> 12:32.720]  like Canada.
[12:32.720 --> 12:33.720]  Yeah.
[12:33.720 --> 12:34.720]  Okay.
[12:34.720 --> 12:35.720]  See,
[12:35.720 --> 12:36.720]  they went with the Colorado and the sea.
[12:36.720 --> 12:37.720]  They ultra did it.
[12:37.720 --> 12:43.720]  It's C a N N E T I C dot products.
[12:43.720 --> 12:45.720]  Help out our listeners a little bit for sure.
[12:45.720 --> 12:46.720]  All right.
[12:46.720 --> 12:47.720]  So let's get back on track.
[12:47.720 --> 12:48.720]  Uh,
[12:48.720 --> 12:49.720]  Kip,
[12:49.720 --> 12:50.720]  your second question.
[12:50.720 --> 12:51.720]  Uh,
[12:51.720 --> 12:52.720]  first question was dispensary recommendations.
[12:52.720 --> 12:53.720]  Second question.
[12:53.720 --> 12:54.720]  Yes,
[12:54.720 --> 12:57.720]  I'm going to make an episode on troubleshooting and solving problems.
[12:57.720 --> 12:58.720]  That's a really good idea.
[12:58.720 --> 12:59.720]  I've actually got it written down.
[12:59.720 --> 13:01.720]  That's going to be a really in depth.
[13:01.720 --> 13:03.720]  One of those long episodes I've got to write out and really plan.
[13:03.720 --> 13:04.720]  Well,
[13:04.720 --> 13:05.720]  cause there's a lot of stuff to think about.
[13:05.720 --> 13:07.720]  I got to find a starting point.
[13:07.720 --> 13:10.720]  I think the starting point is printing out that chart that shows you all the
[13:10.720 --> 13:11.720]  leaves with fucked up problems.
[13:11.720 --> 13:13.720]  Just talk about what all that shit is.
[13:13.720 --> 13:15.720]  You're going to want to include in the show notes for that.
[13:15.720 --> 13:16.720]  Yes,
[13:16.720 --> 13:17.720]  I did just smack the microphone.
[13:17.720 --> 13:18.720]  Thank you.
[13:18.720 --> 13:19.720]  Thank you.
[13:19.720 --> 13:20.720]  Smack the shit out of that.
[13:20.720 --> 13:21.720]  Mike,
[13:21.720 --> 13:22.720]  like a bad kid beat the shit out of it.
[13:22.720 --> 13:23.720]  All right.
[13:23.720 --> 13:24.720]  Um,
[13:24.720 --> 13:25.720]  what am I supposed to call you?
[13:25.720 --> 13:26.720]  Fats fats dude.
[13:26.720 --> 13:27.720]  Thanks for sending us an email.
[13:27.720 --> 13:28.720]  When you're in Denver,
[13:28.720 --> 13:29.720]  contact me,
[13:29.720 --> 13:30.720]  bro.
[13:30.720 --> 13:31.720]  Let me know.
[13:31.720 --> 13:32.720]  Message me somehow.
[13:32.720 --> 13:33.720]  I'll be like,
[13:33.720 --> 13:34.720]  I am about to land in Denver.
[13:34.720 --> 13:35.720]  I'm a busy man,
[13:35.720 --> 13:36.720]  honestly.
[13:36.720 --> 13:38.720]  And Denver is 125 miles from my house.
[13:38.720 --> 13:40.720]  It's 60 miles from my work,
[13:40.720 --> 13:43.720]  but you never know because I go to Denver and do some shit.
[13:43.720 --> 13:44.720]  Doug Benson might be in town.
[13:44.720 --> 13:45.720]  Yeah.
[13:45.720 --> 13:46.720]  If Doug Benz have secret session,
[13:46.720 --> 13:47.720]  if it's the way it could be,
[13:47.720 --> 13:49.720]  you might be here during secret sesh.
[13:49.720 --> 13:50.720]  Me?
[13:50.720 --> 13:51.720]  No,
[13:51.720 --> 13:52.720]  no.
[13:52.720 --> 13:53.720]  I was like,
[13:53.720 --> 13:54.720]  when you looked at me,
[13:54.720 --> 13:55.720]  you fucking better be here.
[13:55.720 --> 13:56.720]  I was like,
[13:56.720 --> 13:57.720]  what I'm going to shout out the secret session.
[13:57.720 --> 13:58.720]  For sure.
[13:58.720 --> 13:59.720]  It's a secret.
[13:59.720 --> 14:00.720]  Don't talk about it,
[14:00.720 --> 14:01.720]  but it may be,
[14:01.720 --> 14:02.720]  maybe you're hearing secret sesh.
[14:02.720 --> 14:03.720]  Uh,
[14:03.720 --> 14:04.720]  either way,
[14:04.720 --> 14:05.720]  bro,
[14:05.720 --> 14:06.720]  send me a message.
[14:06.720 --> 14:07.720]  Let me know that you're coming.
[14:07.720 --> 14:08.720]  Uh,
[14:08.720 --> 14:09.720]  email me just like you did and let me know a little more accurate.
[14:09.720 --> 14:10.720]  Your details.
[14:10.720 --> 14:11.720]  This episode will probably come out by the time your trip already happened,
[14:11.720 --> 14:13.720]  but I'm going to message you and make sure that we get in touch with each other.
[14:13.720 --> 14:14.720]  And I hope you hear this.
[14:14.720 --> 14:15.720]  I hope you hear us talking about you.
[14:15.720 --> 14:16.720]  Um,
[14:16.720 --> 14:18.720]  your trip that already happened to us.
[14:18.720 --> 14:19.720]  It's in the future to you.
[14:19.720 --> 14:20.720]  It's in the past.
[14:20.720 --> 14:21.720]  Everyone in the roof,
[14:21.720 --> 14:22.720]  their head blew up.
[14:22.720 --> 14:23.720]  All right.
[14:23.720 --> 14:24.720]  So I tease this part at the start of the show.
[14:24.720 --> 14:33.720]  We want to talk about the craziest shit we've ever seen in a dispensary or at a smoke event or at a cannabis cup or at the dab lounge.
[14:33.720 --> 14:34.720]  Some crazy shit.
[14:34.720 --> 14:35.720]  Uh,
[14:35.720 --> 14:36.720]  Lindsay's taking a drink.
[14:36.720 --> 14:37.720]  So I'm going to let Mike go first.
[14:37.720 --> 14:38.720]  Mike,
[14:38.720 --> 14:39.720]  uh,
[14:39.720 --> 14:40.720]  Mike and I ran,
[14:40.720 --> 14:41.720]  let's give you a little background story.
[14:41.720 --> 14:43.720]  Mike and I ran the first and only dispensary in city limits in Pueblo,
[14:43.720 --> 14:44.720]  Colorado.
[14:44.720 --> 14:47.720]  And this dispensary was located right at the middle of the city.
[14:48.720 --> 14:49.720]  Um,
[14:49.720 --> 14:52.720]  the East side of our town is hood as fuck.
[14:52.720 --> 14:53.720]  Uh,
[14:53.720 --> 14:54.720]  there's a foot at mile.
[14:54.720 --> 14:56.720]  There's a lot of face tattoos.
[14:56.720 --> 14:57.720]  Uh,
[14:57.720 --> 14:58.720]  there's a lot of pocket knives.
[14:58.720 --> 15:00.720]  There's a lot of use guys is,
[15:00.720 --> 15:01.720]  uh,
[15:01.720 --> 15:02.720]  it's not,
[15:02.720 --> 15:03.720]  it's not the prettiest place to go.
[15:03.720 --> 15:05.720]  So all those people came and then,
[15:05.720 --> 15:06.720]  uh,
[15:06.720 --> 15:07.720]  every,
[15:07.720 --> 15:08.720]  we had people,
[15:08.720 --> 15:09.720]  everybody,
[15:09.720 --> 15:10.720]  all parts of Colorado.
[15:10.720 --> 15:11.720]  This was back in the purely medical day.
[15:11.720 --> 15:14.720]  So it was just anybody who had or wanted a medical marijuana card.
[15:14.720 --> 15:15.720]  There would be,
[15:15.720 --> 15:18.720]  we had probably 10 seats inside the place and there would be people in every
[15:18.720 --> 15:22.720]  chair and then standing outside waiting to come in still.
[15:22.720 --> 15:25.720]  And there was a receptionist and myself as a bud tender.
[15:25.720 --> 15:27.720]  And then I hired Mike as a backup bud tender,
[15:27.720 --> 15:29.720]  because I couldn't get through everybody there.
[15:29.720 --> 15:32.720]  And then my second week we hired the security guard.
[15:32.720 --> 15:33.720]  Finally,
[15:33.720 --> 15:36.720]  we were really inventing shit as we went along,
[15:36.720 --> 15:37.720]  just making it up.
[15:37.720 --> 15:39.720]  The industry was being invented is there was no,
[15:39.720 --> 15:41.720]  there was no badge.
[15:41.720 --> 15:42.720]  There was no time clock.
[15:42.720 --> 15:43.720]  We would show up.
[15:43.720 --> 15:47.720]  There was barely other dispensaries that you could go check out and steal stuff
[15:47.720 --> 15:49.720]  and ideas from like you.
[15:49.720 --> 15:50.720]  Now,
[15:50.720 --> 15:52.720]  if you're thinking about opening a dispensary,
[15:52.720 --> 15:55.720]  you can just go to a hundred of them and pick like the 10 things you like
[15:55.720 --> 15:56.720]  about your favorites.
[15:56.720 --> 15:58.720]  Back then there wasn't even that.
[15:58.720 --> 16:00.720]  The boss would pay me to drive to Denver on the,
[16:00.720 --> 16:01.720]  if I was going to a concert,
[16:01.720 --> 16:02.720]  he'd be like,
[16:02.720 --> 16:03.720]  here's some money.
[16:03.720 --> 16:04.720]  Stop at a couple of dispensaries,
[16:04.720 --> 16:06.720]  pick up some advertisements and some product and see what they got.
[16:06.720 --> 16:09.720]  And he'd just throw me money to go do recon work and come back and kind of
[16:09.720 --> 16:11.720]  adjust our shit to be a little bit better.
[16:11.720 --> 16:12.720]  Every time we went,
[16:12.720 --> 16:13.720]  crazy old dude.
[16:13.720 --> 16:17.720]  But so Mike and I ran the first place and I had some fucking crazy
[16:17.720 --> 16:19.720]  experiences in that place.
[16:19.720 --> 16:20.720]  I wrote down just to,
[16:20.720 --> 16:22.720]  just to give you a tease of my list,
[16:22.720 --> 16:23.720]  threats,
[16:23.720 --> 16:24.720]  plants,
[16:24.720 --> 16:25.720]  gun chat,
[16:25.720 --> 16:26.720]  trades,
[16:26.720 --> 16:27.720]  and gifts.
[16:27.720 --> 16:28.720]  Just the gifts.
[16:28.720 --> 16:30.720]  Do you remember the lady that gave us the piece?
[16:30.720 --> 16:32.720]  That's exactly what I meant by gifts.
[16:32.720 --> 16:33.720]  Yeah.
[16:33.720 --> 16:34.720]  Yeah.
[16:34.720 --> 16:37.720]  This older lady kind of looked like maybe a 55,
[16:37.720 --> 16:38.720]  65 year old,
[16:38.720 --> 16:40.720]  a better biker chick on the street.
[16:40.720 --> 16:41.720]  30 though,
[16:41.720 --> 16:42.720]  to tell you the truth,
[16:42.720 --> 16:44.720]  like sometimes the winds mean,
[16:44.720 --> 16:45.720]  I guess,
[16:45.720 --> 16:46.720]  I don't know.
[16:46.720 --> 16:47.720]  Life beat.
[16:47.720 --> 16:50.720]  It's normal transaction.
[16:50.720 --> 16:53.720]  Nothing surprising or interesting about it until right at the end.
[16:53.720 --> 16:54.720]  She's like,
[16:54.720 --> 16:55.720]  you two are sweet here.
[16:55.720 --> 16:56.720]  Check this out.
[16:56.720 --> 16:59.720]  She reaches into her purse and pulls out this little plastic bag with this
[16:59.720 --> 17:00.720]  black.
[17:00.720 --> 17:02.720]  It looked like old bubble gum and pocket lint.
[17:02.720 --> 17:05.720]  Like it was black and in like stringy.
[17:05.720 --> 17:06.720]  And she was like,
[17:07.720 --> 17:08.720]  here's some opium for you.
[17:08.720 --> 17:09.720]  I hope you enjoy it.
[17:09.720 --> 17:10.720]  And it just kind of walked off.
[17:10.720 --> 17:12.720]  You just know what fake skin looks like from Halloween.
[17:12.720 --> 17:14.720]  That thin layer of fake skin when it dries on your skin,
[17:14.720 --> 17:16.720]  it kind of looked like that folded up in a cellophane.
[17:16.720 --> 17:18.720]  That place was bizarre.
[17:18.720 --> 17:19.720]  The,
[17:19.720 --> 17:21.720]  my favorite people there were the kids coming there to sell,
[17:21.720 --> 17:22.720]  sell weed.
[17:22.720 --> 17:25.720]  They just wander in terror with a terrified look on their face with a
[17:25.720 --> 17:26.720]  little bit of a,
[17:26.720 --> 17:27.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:27.720 --> 17:28.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:28.720 --> 17:29.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:29.720 --> 17:30.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:30.720 --> 17:31.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:31.720 --> 17:32.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:32.720 --> 17:33.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:33.720 --> 17:34.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:34.720 --> 17:35.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:35.720 --> 17:36.720]  a little,
[17:36.720 --> 17:37.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:37.720 --> 17:38.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:38.720 --> 17:39.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:39.720 --> 17:40.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:40.720 --> 17:41.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:41.720 --> 17:42.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:42.720 --> 17:43.720]  little bit of a,
[17:43.720 --> 17:44.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:44.720 --> 17:45.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:45.720 --> 17:46.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:46.720 --> 17:47.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:47.720 --> 17:48.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:48.720 --> 17:49.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:49.720 --> 17:50.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:50.720 --> 17:51.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:51.720 --> 17:52.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:52.720 --> 17:53.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:53.720 --> 17:54.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:54.720 --> 17:55.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:55.720 --> 17:56.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:56.720 --> 17:57.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:57.720 --> 17:58.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:58.720 --> 17:59.720]  a little bit of a,
[17:59.720 --> 18:00.720]  a little bit of a,
[18:00.720 --> 18:01.720]  a little bit of a,
[18:01.720 --> 18:05.600]  and they just wanted into a store to try and sell it.
[18:05.600 --> 18:07.960]  Like it's a weird experience, I'm sure.
[18:07.960 --> 18:09.120]  But we'd get like three of those,
[18:09.120 --> 18:10.320]  four of those guys a day sometimes.
[18:10.320 --> 18:12.280]  I made a lot of friends from those folks.
[18:12.280 --> 18:14.960]  A lot of future, a lot of future things.
[18:14.960 --> 18:17.960]  Yeah, I would offer those guys 800 a quarter pound
[18:17.960 --> 18:20.220]  or 3,200 a pound, take it or leave it.
[18:20.220 --> 18:23.280]  You could get 900 out of me if it was really, really good.
[18:23.280 --> 18:25.080]  But a lot of those people would just look at me like,
[18:25.080 --> 18:28.880]  ugh, like they wanted so much more for that back then.
[18:28.880 --> 18:31.360]  Now herb is, now wholesale commercial herb
[18:31.360 --> 18:32.920]  is about $2,000 a pound.
[18:32.920 --> 18:35.240]  Like it's, you could find it if you're looking
[18:35.240 --> 18:38.040]  for like some outdoor commercial, like rec weed,
[18:38.040 --> 18:40.800]  like some, ooh, do I wanna drop any dispensary names?
[18:40.800 --> 18:42.680]  Geez, the stuff that you get over there
[18:42.680 --> 18:46.160]  at that one spot, it's like 100 bucks an ounce.
[18:46.160 --> 18:49.000]  It's probably like $1,500 a pound, you know,
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.680]  1,400 a pound to get that shit.
[18:51.680 --> 18:54.560]  Yucky, weed's gotten way cheaper.
[18:54.560 --> 18:56.960]  All right, Mike, what's one of your fucking craziest
[18:56.960 --> 18:58.560]  memories you have from Metamar?
[19:00.600 --> 19:03.000]  There's so many bizarre ones.
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.700]  The you two falling down the stairs is,
[19:07.600 --> 19:12.600]  the edibles one of the manager's owners would make,
[19:12.800 --> 19:14.760]  they were all homemade, they were all delicious,
[19:14.760 --> 19:16.740]  and they were all insanely potent.
[19:18.440 --> 19:20.960]  And she was sweet and she would kind of insist
[19:20.960 --> 19:22.840]  that you eat like one of everything
[19:22.840 --> 19:24.880]  when she'd bring in a new batch.
[19:24.920 --> 19:27.920]  And so by like midday or lunch,
[19:27.920 --> 19:30.920]  you'd be like too high to form words sometimes.
[19:30.920 --> 19:33.720]  And watching a coworker tumble down a switchback stair
[19:33.720 --> 19:36.160]  and then land like sprawled out face first
[19:36.160 --> 19:37.780]  in front of a lobby full of customers,
[19:37.780 --> 19:40.480]  and then they just pop up and they're like, who's next?
[19:43.000 --> 19:44.440]  Quickest way down the stairs.
[19:46.960 --> 19:49.600]  Hauling all the plants out of there.
[19:49.600 --> 19:50.440]  Do you remember that?
[19:50.440 --> 19:53.520]  Yeah, we loaded up an RV, or was it the RV time?
[19:53.520 --> 19:55.360]  Or the time we did the U-Haul truck?
[19:56.240 --> 20:00.960]  When we got shut down, it was just you have to stop.
[20:00.960 --> 20:02.940]  And we were like, okay, we'll stop then,
[20:02.940 --> 20:05.960]  but we've got all this shit in the store,
[20:05.960 --> 20:07.200]  what do we do with it?
[20:07.200 --> 20:09.960]  And basically all of the plants that were in the grow
[20:09.960 --> 20:13.040]  were just if you want them, hauler.
[20:13.040 --> 20:17.340]  And so for like half a day, from like noon to midnight,
[20:17.340 --> 20:19.440]  randomly people would pull up out back,
[20:19.440 --> 20:22.940]  walk around, knock on the door, come inside,
[20:23.340 --> 20:25.300]  and we'd pick out the half dozen or dozen
[20:25.300 --> 20:28.260]  or whatever plants they had paperwork for and wanted,
[20:28.260 --> 20:30.780]  load them into whatever vehicle they had and they'd bail.
[20:30.780 --> 20:32.780]  My backyard was packed.
[20:32.780 --> 20:36.380]  It was one of the strangest experiences of my life.
[20:37.660 --> 20:39.420]  But it was a lot of fun to be,
[20:39.420 --> 20:41.180]  like at one point there was a U-Haul
[20:41.180 --> 20:44.460]  and the dude was a caregiver for like 11 people.
[20:44.460 --> 20:46.300]  And so we sat there and went through his paperwork
[20:46.300 --> 20:48.140]  for like 20 minutes, double checking everything,
[20:48.140 --> 20:50.980]  and then loaded, oh fuck, dude, I don't even know.
[20:50.980 --> 20:53.140]  By the time we got that back of that U-Haul loaded,
[20:53.140 --> 20:54.420]  I was sweating so bad.
[20:55.620 --> 20:57.820]  We moved a lot of plants around at that place.
[20:57.820 --> 20:58.980]  Recently I had a dude.
[20:58.980 --> 21:00.500]  Sketchy moved plants around.
[21:01.580 --> 21:03.380]  Recently I had a dude show up.
[21:03.380 --> 21:08.380]  He's just in, maybe 350 pounds, maybe 45 years old,
[21:08.540 --> 21:09.700]  but like life's been rough.
[21:09.700 --> 21:12.640]  So there's like a lot of, yeah, this is the new place.
[21:14.060 --> 21:15.380]  He comes walking up to the door
[21:15.380 --> 21:17.900]  and already security guard's like, uh-uh.
[21:17.900 --> 21:19.700]  But like halfway to that door,
[21:19.700 --> 21:22.820]  we noticed that there's a good wobble to his walk too.
[21:22.820 --> 21:24.220]  So he gets to the front door, he's like,
[21:24.220 --> 21:25.420]  there's the weed store!
[21:25.420 --> 21:28.140]  And the security guard's like, no sir, you can't come in.
[21:28.140 --> 21:29.140]  He's like, why not?
[21:29.140 --> 21:31.580]  The security guard's like, well A, you're barefoot,
[21:31.580 --> 21:34.220]  B, you're not wearing a shirt, you're topless,
[21:34.220 --> 21:35.580]  and C, you're drunk.
[21:35.580 --> 21:36.900]  Like, sir, you have to leave.
[21:36.900 --> 21:38.420]  And he's like, no, this is the weed store.
[21:38.420 --> 21:41.380]  And he goes to push past my armed security guard.
[21:41.380 --> 21:43.380]  And so the security guard blocks his way
[21:43.380 --> 21:44.980]  and is like, sir, you really can't come in.
[21:44.980 --> 21:46.500]  You're barefoot, you're not wearing a shirt.
[21:46.500 --> 21:48.460]  He goes, Jesus, it was barefoot!
[21:48.580 --> 21:53.460]  It's just like, sure.
[21:53.460 --> 21:55.500]  But like, that doesn't mean we're gonna let you
[21:55.500 --> 21:56.620]  into our dispensary.
[21:58.540 --> 22:01.220]  Yeah, that's just random stuff
[22:01.220 --> 22:02.460]  that's popping in my mind right now.
[22:02.460 --> 22:03.460]  I've taken some dabs.
[22:03.460 --> 22:04.780]  I know there's stranger shit.
[22:04.780 --> 22:07.060]  I just keep seeing you fall down those stairs.
[22:09.020 --> 22:10.820]  One time I was sitting at Metamar,
[22:10.820 --> 22:14.180]  and the reason I mentioned the thugs that used to come in,
[22:14.180 --> 22:15.300]  there was a bunch of normal people,
[22:15.300 --> 22:17.420]  and then a group of four or five
[22:17.420 --> 22:19.820]  youngster, gangster kind of kids,
[22:19.820 --> 22:22.340]  and they were all talking about their gun collections.
[22:22.340 --> 22:25.460]  And I could see the white folk just cringing,
[22:25.460 --> 22:27.420]  just like, we're all gonna fucking die in here.
[22:27.420 --> 22:28.860]  I could see it on all their faces.
[22:28.860 --> 22:31.860]  That was one of the funniest fucking things I remember.
[22:31.860 --> 22:34.580]  Bro, Chris, you don't work in a dispensary,
[22:34.580 --> 22:36.180]  but I'm sure you've seen some wack-ass shit
[22:36.180 --> 22:38.300]  somewhere at a smoke club or a dispensary.
[22:38.300 --> 22:41.740]  Yeah, people just say the craziest shit inside dispensaries.
[22:41.740 --> 22:43.100]  People think just because it's legal,
[22:43.100 --> 22:45.220]  they can just say whatever the hell they want.
[22:45.740 --> 22:47.620]  This isn't a law-free zone.
[22:48.300 --> 22:50.940]  It's just we have legal weed stores.
[22:50.940 --> 22:53.540]  Yeah, when you go in with your friends,
[22:53.540 --> 22:55.380]  and then your friend passes you all the money,
[22:55.380 --> 22:57.660]  and you say, yeah, I got you, don't worry about it.
[22:57.660 --> 22:59.260]  You can't do that.
[22:59.260 --> 23:02.180]  Lindsay's shaking her head like, no, you have to leave now.
[23:02.180 --> 23:05.060]  I had some guy come in the dispensary the other day,
[23:05.060 --> 23:07.940]  and he was buying an ounce of flour,
[23:07.940 --> 23:10.540]  and he said something about it was for somebody else.
[23:10.540 --> 23:12.860]  And I was like, no, this is for you.
[23:13.780 --> 23:15.900]  You know, like, you can't say that in here.
[23:16.580 --> 23:19.420]  Like, this is your one warning, you know?
[23:19.420 --> 23:21.260]  And he was like, well, it's not a big deal.
[23:21.260 --> 23:24.940]  I'm gifting him this, bud, so I'm allowed to do that.
[23:24.940 --> 23:27.260]  And I was like, no. No.
[23:27.260 --> 23:30.380]  You're not allowed to take your medical card.
[23:30.380 --> 23:32.620]  Not on anybody's birthday. Go and buy.
[23:33.820 --> 23:35.180]  You can't just gift people.
[23:35.180 --> 23:38.140]  There's different rules for rec and medical,
[23:38.140 --> 23:39.580]  and when you're in a medical shop,
[23:39.620 --> 23:42.460]  you have to play by the height of the medical rules.
[23:43.780 --> 23:46.620]  Legally, it's essentially you're at a pharmacy,
[23:46.620 --> 23:48.620]  and the pharmacist is like, here's your pills.
[23:48.620 --> 23:51.340]  And you're like, cool, I'm going to give them to my cousin, Billy.
[23:51.340 --> 23:52.460]  Right.
[23:52.460 --> 23:53.660]  You do that two or three times,
[23:53.660 --> 23:55.980]  and the pharmacist is going to go, fuck you and your pills.
[23:55.980 --> 23:57.660]  Like, you ain't getting these, and I'm calling the cops.
[23:57.660 --> 23:59.060]  And you actually sign a member agreement
[23:59.060 --> 24:01.060]  at Greener Healthy Wellness that says in bold letters,
[24:01.060 --> 24:03.500]  I will not redistribute this medicine to anybody else.
[24:03.500 --> 24:05.380]  And so that's what our main concern there
[24:05.380 --> 24:06.460]  is that you're not going ...
[24:06.460 --> 24:08.740]  Nobody needs to get that medicine from you.
[24:08.740 --> 24:10.660]  If they need that medicine,
[24:10.660 --> 24:14.500]  they have the means to get that product legally themselves.
[24:14.500 --> 24:16.420]  We don't need to be ...
[24:16.420 --> 24:18.620]  We don't need to be ... You don't need to middleman for them.
[24:18.620 --> 24:20.020]  We don't need to know about that.
[24:20.020 --> 24:21.620]  If once you take that cannabis home
[24:21.620 --> 24:22.940]  and take it out of the black package
[24:22.940 --> 24:27.020]  that we've sold it to you in, and some time passes,
[24:27.020 --> 24:29.180]  we don't know what happens after that, and we can't care.
[24:29.180 --> 24:31.860]  But don't tell us about it and take it out of our fucking packaging,
[24:31.860 --> 24:33.140]  no matter what you do with it.
[24:33.140 --> 24:34.980]  Now it's your cannabis.
[24:34.980 --> 24:36.180]  Right.
[24:36.180 --> 24:37.380]  Then whatever can happen.
[24:37.980 --> 24:40.220]  You can gift your cannabis to people,
[24:40.220 --> 24:41.940]  but not the stuff you got at Greener Healthy.
[24:41.940 --> 24:43.060]  Right.
[24:43.060 --> 24:45.620]  All right. Go for it. You got something to say?
[24:45.620 --> 24:46.820]  I see it in your face.
[24:46.820 --> 24:48.020]  No. I don't.
[24:48.020 --> 24:49.940]  It feels like you have some poignant message to relate to the world.
[24:49.940 --> 24:53.660]  You can't think of anything from hanging around the smoke shop with me?
[24:53.660 --> 24:57.500]  Well, hanging around the smoke shop, people just thought it was a dispensary,
[24:57.500 --> 24:59.700]  which is still the oddest thing, too.
[24:59.700 --> 25:01.660]  You know what's actually really odd
[25:01.660 --> 25:03.940]  that really doesn't have anything to do with weed?
[25:03.940 --> 25:06.180]  I was working in the smoke shop one day.
[25:06.180 --> 25:09.660]  It was a Saturday, and me and my manager were both on the floor.
[25:11.180 --> 25:14.620]  And I had some guy, I was showing him some hand pipe,
[25:14.620 --> 25:19.060]  and I was, I guess I should explain that I don't have hair on the sides of my head.
[25:19.060 --> 25:21.780]  Like, I have the sides of my head shaved.
[25:21.780 --> 25:24.260]  And I was like, I had my head down,
[25:24.260 --> 25:26.980]  and I was like pulling out a pipe to show him.
[25:26.980 --> 25:29.580]  And he reaches across the counter, and he takes his hand,
[25:29.580 --> 25:32.340]  and he runs it across the side of my head.
[25:32.340 --> 25:33.820]  Creepy.
[25:33.820 --> 25:34.940]  Yeah.
[25:34.940 --> 25:36.500]  That's creepy in half, dude.
[25:36.500 --> 25:40.260]  And I just was like, please don't touch me.
[25:41.260 --> 25:45.100]  Like, I didn't think that I had to make that an out loud rule,
[25:45.100 --> 25:46.940]  but please don't touch me.
[25:46.940 --> 25:48.140]  That's weird.
[25:48.140 --> 25:49.340]  Right?
[25:49.340 --> 25:52.300]  We used to have this guy, similar lines.
[25:52.300 --> 25:56.420]  This guy used to come in, and he was kind of a nightmarish customer.
[25:56.420 --> 25:59.620]  Like, he did not typically have a pleasant smell to him.
[26:00.740 --> 26:04.820]  He was typically dressed and like took too much acid, went to Goodwill.
[26:04.940 --> 26:06.060]  I don't know exactly who you're talking about.
[26:06.060 --> 26:08.260]  I wondered if that's who you were going for.
[26:08.260 --> 26:12.340]  And, but he had a car that didn't match his wardrobe and odor.
[26:13.700 --> 26:20.820]  It was like a better kept up, like early 2000s, like Corvette, I think.
[26:22.220 --> 26:27.700]  And he's shopping, and he buys like $6 worth of something or whatever.
[26:27.700 --> 26:31.740]  Not a lot of money worth of flour.
[26:31.740 --> 26:34.900]  And my coworker's stapling his bag shut.
[26:34.900 --> 26:38.340]  He goes, I just got new carpet in my trunk.
[26:38.340 --> 26:41.420]  And the two girls I'm working with are like, what an odd thing to say.
[26:41.420 --> 26:43.980]  Just kind of look at them, and they're like, oh, interesting.
[26:43.980 --> 26:45.980]  And he goes, you two want to come outside and smell it?
[26:47.420 --> 26:50.860]  And there was like three heartbeats where all three of us that were at work that
[26:50.860 --> 26:52.420]  night were like, he just fucking said smell it.
[26:52.420 --> 26:54.780]  He said smell it, not look at, not.
[26:54.780 --> 26:56.420]  He said smell.
[26:56.420 --> 26:59.780]  And just so smooth.
[26:59.780 --> 27:04.300]  Jess goes, no, sir, we're actually, we're not allowed to leave the store until
[27:04.300 --> 27:06.740]  after closing, it's a rule.
[27:06.740 --> 27:08.340]  Just smooth as anything.
[27:08.340 --> 27:10.140]  I half believed it when she said it.
[27:10.140 --> 27:10.980]  Was she ever a stripper?
[27:10.980 --> 27:12.100]  That's like a stripper line.
[27:12.100 --> 27:13.340]  I have no idea.
[27:13.340 --> 27:19.340]  In what world would you go out to someone's car and even, wait, no, no, no.
[27:19.340 --> 27:23.260]  I mean like, okay, sniffing's really funny, but like, in what world would you
[27:23.260 --> 27:28.260]  even go and look at someone's new carpet in their trunk?
[27:28.260 --> 27:31.860]  You obviously just killed somebody and threw them in the trunk and got your
[27:31.860 --> 27:33.500]  carpet redone back there.
[27:33.500 --> 27:35.940]  And now you want me to go out there and be the next one.
[27:35.940 --> 27:36.780]  And you should keep it a secret.
[27:36.780 --> 27:37.860]  Don't tell anybody about it.
[27:37.860 --> 27:39.860]  Check out this trunk I just cleaned out.
[27:39.860 --> 27:40.700]  It was dirty.
[27:40.700 --> 27:42.740]  Look, throws on the UV light.
[27:42.740 --> 27:45.140]  Look, you can't even see the spots anymore.
[27:47.460 --> 27:49.380]  Like Jesus.
[27:49.380 --> 27:51.500]  Yeah, that one stands way out.
[27:51.500 --> 27:52.620]  That's terrible.
[27:52.620 --> 27:55.740]  You remember when people used to bring plants into Metamar that had problems?
[27:55.740 --> 27:57.780]  They'd bring up, what's wrong with this?
[27:58.220 --> 28:01.460]  They brought a big old plant and a fucking like a Walmart bag and a pot and a
[28:01.460 --> 28:04.420]  potted plant with leaves just sticking out and he carries it in and he opens up
[28:04.420 --> 28:05.700]  and it's all coated in powdery mildew.
[28:05.700 --> 28:06.540]  And he's like, what is this?
[28:06.540 --> 28:08.180]  I was like, get that the fuck out of here, bro.
[28:08.180 --> 28:09.260]  Like we got plants.
[28:09.260 --> 28:10.100]  Like he's bad.
[28:10.100 --> 28:10.860]  Yeah.
[28:10.860 --> 28:11.740]  And I told him what it was.
[28:11.740 --> 28:14.220]  And I was like, that's really, that's only solvable by fire.
[28:14.220 --> 28:16.460]  Like with as bad as that is, that just needs fire.
[28:16.460 --> 28:18.620]  You just got to just.
[28:18.620 --> 28:22.020]  I remember you like just kind of mumbling under your breath.
[28:22.020 --> 28:22.740]  Like, fuck dude.
[28:22.740 --> 28:25.980]  Now I'm going to have to shower like three times before I can get my garden
[28:26.020 --> 28:30.020]  chores done tonight because just one fool after another had brought in a
[28:30.020 --> 28:34.900]  potted plant with like a paper trash bag, like gently set over the little
[28:34.900 --> 28:38.460]  standup support sticks so that they could kind of hide what they were, what
[28:38.460 --> 28:41.420]  kind of plant they were carrying in public view as they brought it into the
[28:41.420 --> 28:43.900]  dispensary to try to get us to diagnose it.
[28:44.860 --> 28:47.740]  Um, fucking people open it up shit with spider mites on it.
[28:48.540 --> 28:52.340]  Um, people leaving our place with clones and not giving a fuck.
[28:52.380 --> 28:52.940]  Just carry it.
[28:53.420 --> 28:57.100]  We sold clones in cups and you could buy if your plant count was 140, we'd
[28:57.100 --> 28:58.100]  sell you 140 clones.
[28:58.100 --> 28:59.260]  We didn't give a shit back in the day.
[28:59.580 --> 29:02.460]  And people would leave with just trays of clones in their hands, like six inch
[29:02.460 --> 29:04.740]  tall plants in cups, just carrying them out to the car.
[29:05.260 --> 29:06.620]  Like we didn't care at all.
[29:06.900 --> 29:11.500]  I remember one guy coming back like two or three days in a row, maybe six trips
[29:11.500 --> 29:14.380]  total and buying like two clones at a time.
[29:14.820 --> 29:17.180]  And when, when I asked him like what the hell's going on?
[29:17.180 --> 29:19.700]  And he was, he goes, I keep sending them out back.
[29:19.700 --> 29:21.980]  So they get used to the light and the birds keep eating them.
[29:23.220 --> 29:25.460]  And I'm like, dude, you're on clones, like seven and eight.
[29:25.460 --> 29:26.420]  Like what the fuck?
[29:26.420 --> 29:27.700]  Come up with a plan, bro.
[29:29.060 --> 29:34.100]  Get a shotgun, like get some chicken wire, put them inside, like something
[29:34.420 --> 29:35.700]  set up by the window.
[29:38.140 --> 29:43.140]  Speaking of bringing things into the dispensary, I'm friends with the person.
[29:43.140 --> 29:49.380]  So I'm not going to say where any of that, but somebody came into a place that I work
[29:49.420 --> 29:55.540]  and brought in a product that they wanted us to look at.
[29:55.660 --> 30:06.060]  And the entire dome on the pen was just like this color, like, you know, the, like,
[30:06.060 --> 30:11.180]  you know, the like dome open globe, like open glass could not even see it.
[30:11.180 --> 30:16.340]  And I was just like, you can't have that in here.
[30:16.380 --> 30:16.820]  Right.
[30:16.820 --> 30:17.940]  We are on camera.
[30:17.940 --> 30:21.420]  I have people pulling vaporizers out of their pocket left and right.
[30:22.220 --> 30:26.980]  Um, I've got a weird bag of returned ones that we've got like receipts and like as
[30:26.980 --> 30:30.060]  much documentation as we can, because we send them back to the company for
[30:30.060 --> 30:33.900]  replacement units, but half of them are like burnout and a tiny bit dirty.
[30:34.460 --> 30:39.380]  And so we keep Epic records on all of that shit just so that there's no, that's
[30:39.380 --> 30:42.460]  a daily occurrence, people pulling shit like that out of their pocket.
[30:43.180 --> 30:44.340]  Mike at the place you work.
[30:45.340 --> 30:48.780]  Uh, I gotta be careful how I ask this.
[30:49.260 --> 30:50.900]  Do you get a prize for wearing a small shirt?
[30:52.180 --> 30:55.500]  Sometimes it's a fancy is working.
[30:55.620 --> 30:55.860]  Yeah.
[30:55.860 --> 30:56.060]  Yeah.
[30:56.060 --> 30:58.220]  That's some of the random shit that I've seen happen at that place.
[30:58.220 --> 31:00.180]  How crazy it's it is during that day.
[31:00.180 --> 31:04.220]  So, I mean, sometimes we'll see a couple hundred people in a day and weird
[31:04.220 --> 31:05.660]  things happen when it's that crazy.
[31:05.660 --> 31:08.940]  In the summer, if you shop at Mike's dispensary and you're in like a bikini,
[31:09.180 --> 31:10.580]  there's a good chance you'll get some gifts.
[31:11.020 --> 31:12.900]  Like a couple of free t-shirts.
[31:13.900 --> 31:14.220]  Yeah.
[31:14.540 --> 31:14.740]  Yeah.
[31:14.740 --> 31:17.820]  It's funny when, when you watch all the dudes that work there, the demand, the
[31:17.820 --> 31:21.700]  older manager dudes try to stumble over Mike to get the fucking young customers.
[31:21.700 --> 31:23.100]  Those are, those are to be bees.
[31:25.380 --> 31:25.660]  All right.
[31:25.660 --> 31:28.020]  So I'm going to tell a ridiculous story that happened to me one
[31:28.020 --> 31:29.260]  time when I worked at a dispensary.
[31:29.260 --> 31:32.700]  This probably be the last one of these crazy stories for this episode,
[31:32.940 --> 31:33.900]  because I thank you for listening.
[31:34.220 --> 31:37.300]  Uh, so one day I was working at work at the dispensary selling good old weed.
[31:37.300 --> 31:38.180]  And it was myself.
[31:38.900 --> 31:42.940]  Uh, and my receptionist is, I guess what she would officially be.
[31:43.100 --> 31:43.860]  Her name was tree.
[31:44.300 --> 31:49.700]  Uh, she probably weighed 90 pounds and was afraid of the wind.
[31:50.100 --> 31:53.420]  Like she was, she was a very, not an imposing human.
[31:53.740 --> 31:54.100]  Yeah.
[31:54.540 --> 31:58.660]  And so one day a normal customer, there were regular customers that would come in.
[31:58.700 --> 31:59.780]  There was a lady.
[32:00.260 --> 32:00.980]  She wasn't even a lady.
[32:00.980 --> 32:02.460]  I'm not going to call her a lady because of what she did.
[32:02.460 --> 32:03.220]  She was a female.
[32:03.540 --> 32:04.500]  She was a large female.
[32:04.700 --> 32:07.860]  And her husband was a dude who was about equal size with me.
[32:08.540 --> 32:10.620]  And they would come in often and I knew who they were.
[32:11.180 --> 32:15.260]  And one day she came in early in the morning and said, how much is an ounce?
[32:15.260 --> 32:18.460]  And I told her an ounce is this much at the time at that dispensary and ounces,
[32:18.460 --> 32:19.740]  $320.
[32:20.220 --> 32:22.100]  And she said, if I come up with three, will you do it?
[32:22.100 --> 32:24.380]  And since she was a regular customer, I said, don't tell anybody
[32:24.380 --> 32:25.900]  I'll hook you up for 300 bucks.
[32:26.220 --> 32:28.580]  I was like, if you send your old man in later, I'll do it for three for him
[32:28.580 --> 32:31.460]  also, because they got a baby and they switch shifts and I just know how that
[32:31.460 --> 32:31.820]  she works.
[32:31.820 --> 32:37.460]  So she comes back later and she's got like 200 and I don't even remember how it
[32:37.460 --> 32:37.820]  goes.
[32:38.140 --> 32:42.380]  And she comes in like way later, we're about to close and she comes back in and
[32:42.380 --> 32:45.340]  she's like, Hey, sell me an ounce for like two 50 or whatever.
[32:45.380 --> 32:46.300]  And I was like, nah, I can't do it.
[32:46.300 --> 32:47.140]  I'll do it for three.
[32:47.180 --> 32:48.540]  Any less than that, I'll get in trouble.
[32:49.100 --> 32:50.100]  And she's like begging.
[32:50.100 --> 32:51.260]  And I'm like, I can't do it.
[32:51.580 --> 32:54.340]  She's like, let me go out to the car and see what I can come up with.
[32:54.780 --> 32:58.100]  She goes out to the car and they're out there for a few minutes.
[32:58.100 --> 32:59.540]  And I asked her, I was like, what's going on?
[32:59.540 --> 33:01.260]  Cause tree can see the window and see their car.
[33:01.260 --> 33:02.620]  And she's like, they're kind of yelling at each other.
[33:02.620 --> 33:03.660]  They'll be back in in a minute.
[33:03.660 --> 33:04.260]  And I was like, cool.
[33:04.260 --> 33:04.900]  Give them a second.
[33:05.900 --> 33:09.940]  So he came in and she's like, I need to see your paperwork.
[33:09.940 --> 33:11.540]  Cause you have to check in every time you come in.
[33:11.540 --> 33:12.700]  And he's like, nah, fuck that.
[33:12.700 --> 33:13.940]  I want to talk to that fucker.
[33:14.220 --> 33:16.020]  And I was like, Oh, so I'm about to go on.
[33:16.060 --> 33:17.660]  And I know it was me that he wanted to talk to.
[33:18.100 --> 33:20.620]  He pushes past her and comes back to the bud room where I am.
[33:20.620 --> 33:22.140]  Cause we've got the bud room in the back of the building.
[33:22.140 --> 33:22.980]  So we can get privacy.
[33:23.500 --> 33:28.220]  And he's like, motherfucker, you told my wife that if she sucks your dick, you'd
[33:28.220 --> 33:30.180]  give her an ounce for 200 bucks.
[33:30.980 --> 33:33.500]  And I was like, bro, I'm not interested in your wife.
[33:34.140 --> 33:34.980]  It's not my weed.
[33:34.980 --> 33:36.140]  I couldn't give her that anyway.
[33:36.180 --> 33:37.740]  And I'd never fucking say that to your wife.
[33:37.780 --> 33:38.900]  I was like, you guys are regulars here.
[33:38.900 --> 33:39.660]  I know who you are.
[33:39.660 --> 33:40.900]  Why the fuck would I do that?
[33:41.260 --> 33:42.820]  And honestly, I'm not even trying to be rude.
[33:43.100 --> 33:44.460]  She was not attractive.
[33:44.740 --> 33:48.740]  She was way, way not in my weight class.
[33:49.140 --> 33:50.980]  And I, I, no thanks.
[33:51.060 --> 33:54.420]  And so I was like, what, like, why would anybody want her to suck their dick?
[33:54.740 --> 33:57.300]  And so he's going off on me, dude.
[33:57.300 --> 33:58.500]  And he's like, I'm going to fuck you up.
[33:58.500 --> 33:59.380]  And he's kind of a big dude.
[33:59.380 --> 34:00.060]  He's my size.
[34:00.060 --> 34:01.100]  Like I'm fucking six, five.
[34:01.100 --> 34:02.620]  He had to be at least six, three or something.
[34:02.620 --> 34:03.580]  He's straight in my eye.
[34:03.820 --> 34:05.900]  He's on the other side of the counter and he kept hitting the counter and the
[34:05.900 --> 34:08.300]  counter is glass and I was like, he's going to break this counter.
[34:08.300 --> 34:10.100]  Like I got to fucking figure this out quick.
[34:10.820 --> 34:12.780]  And tree kept asking, do you want me to call the cops?
[34:12.780 --> 34:13.740]  Do you want me to call the cops?
[34:13.740 --> 34:16.380]  And I'm like, no, I don't want the cops at the dispensary.
[34:16.380 --> 34:16.820]  You know what I mean?
[34:16.820 --> 34:20.220]  That's like the last thing I don't want to bring that to this business already.
[34:21.020 --> 34:24.380]  And so I've got mace and I've got some scissors within reach,
[34:24.420 --> 34:25.700]  like right within reach.
[34:26.060 --> 34:27.340]  And I was starting to get shaky.
[34:27.340 --> 34:30.100]  Like I was getting that, like, I'm about to fight this motherfucker is like the
[34:30.100 --> 34:31.220]  feeling that I had in my head.
[34:31.220 --> 34:32.820]  I was like, this shit's about to go down.
[34:33.380 --> 34:34.420]  And he's like, you motherfucker.
[34:34.420 --> 34:37.220]  You told my wife that if you sold her an ounce for you'd sell her an ounce, if she
[34:37.220 --> 34:40.980]  sucked your dick and, and then tree starts yelling, I was right fucking here.
[34:40.980 --> 34:44.260]  All this between tree and I in the office, in the bedroom is a tapestry.
[34:44.300 --> 34:46.220]  Honestly, that's all it was was a black tapestry.
[34:46.220 --> 34:47.380]  And she's like, I was right here.
[34:47.380 --> 34:48.900]  He didn't fucking say any of that.
[34:49.020 --> 34:50.420]  She's like, I can hear everything.
[34:50.900 --> 34:52.100]  And he's like, fuck you.
[34:52.340 --> 34:55.380]  And finally, when he turned his head, I grabbed the mace and the scissors.
[34:55.380 --> 34:57.900]  I grabbed the mace with my right hand and the scissors with my left hand.
[34:58.260 --> 35:01.140]  And by now his girlfriend came in too, and was backing him up and
[35:01.140 --> 35:02.620]  left, they left the baby in the car.
[35:03.220 --> 35:07.060]  And so I told him, bro, you're kind of threatening me and I'm
[35:07.060 --> 35:08.180]  not sure what to do about it.
[35:08.220 --> 35:09.420]  So I'm going to fucking mace you.
[35:09.460 --> 35:10.340]  And then I'm going to stab you.
[35:10.340 --> 35:11.740]  And then I'm going to make sure fucking wife.
[35:11.740 --> 35:12.900]  And then I'm going to call the cops.
[35:12.900 --> 35:16.300]  If you guys don't get out of here and tree looked at me like, wow, I've
[35:16.300 --> 35:17.700]  never seen that side of you.
[35:17.700 --> 35:20.660]  Cause everybody just knows me as this peaceful dude that grows weed and
[35:20.660 --> 35:23.580]  smokes a ton of weed and fucking as a bud tender and I'm all laid back.
[35:23.580 --> 35:26.060]  And I show up like five minutes late and I'm fucking cool with everything.
[35:26.060 --> 35:26.620]  I don't care.
[35:27.060 --> 35:31.300]  But right now she's sees me about to spray some dude in his face, stab him
[35:31.620 --> 35:35.180]  with fucking trim scissors, and then go after his girl with the mace.
[35:35.180 --> 35:38.580]  I think the only thing that saved me from fighting was when I told him, I'm
[35:38.580 --> 35:40.460]  going to spray you stab you.
[35:40.460 --> 35:42.140]  And then I'm going to spray your girlfriend.
[35:42.500 --> 35:45.220]  She looked at him like, um, I don't want to get mace, baby.
[35:45.220 --> 35:46.940]  This idea ain't working no mo.
[35:47.260 --> 35:49.740]  Like that's when it all kind of started to fucking cool down.
[35:49.740 --> 35:50.820]  But he's like, fuck you.
[35:50.820 --> 35:52.380]  I know where you work and I'll find you.
[35:52.700 --> 35:54.140]  And I was like, I'm here every day, buddy.
[35:54.500 --> 35:55.620]  Like, but that was honest.
[35:55.620 --> 35:58.140]  I'm fucking like, I've got a lot of adrenaline right now just telling that
[35:58.140 --> 36:01.780]  story, but I thought that dude and I wasn't long after that we got the
[36:01.780 --> 36:02.540]  security guard.
[36:03.060 --> 36:03.340]  Yeah.
[36:03.340 --> 36:07.220]  Well, I was like, bro, I can't be here by myself with fucking 20 pounds of weed.
[36:07.580 --> 36:08.060]  We hit the weed.
[36:08.060 --> 36:12.180]  Cause at that point, I mean, we were brand new and we were getting like two
[36:12.180 --> 36:15.580]  calls a month from people that would say like random horrible shit into the
[36:15.580 --> 36:17.420]  phone because we were stealing their business.
[36:18.420 --> 36:19.740]  Um, yeah.
[36:19.860 --> 36:21.660]  And they didn't like the idea of a dispensary in town.
[36:21.660 --> 36:23.580]  Like we should have had a security guard long before that.
[36:23.780 --> 36:24.060]  Yeah.
[36:24.180 --> 36:26.100]  And then the security guard we got was pretty funny.
[36:26.700 --> 36:27.180]  Yeah.
[36:27.700 --> 36:31.100]  One day I was driving down Northern Avenue, one of the main streets here in
[36:31.100 --> 36:34.500]  Pueblo and, uh, I see the security guard.
[36:34.620 --> 36:36.260]  We're both going to met him or to work.
[36:36.260 --> 36:36.940]  I'm the bud tender.
[36:36.940 --> 36:38.420]  He's got to get there at the same time as me.
[36:38.460 --> 36:41.700]  Cause we opened right when I know this story, we're driving down the street and
[36:41.700 --> 36:44.820]  he pulls up next to me and he goes, damn, I say that smells good.
[36:44.940 --> 36:47.420]  And I was smoking a big old fat ass joint on my way to work.
[36:47.740 --> 36:49.020]  And I took a big old hit off of it.
[36:49.020 --> 36:50.300]  And I was like, I'm high enough.
[36:50.300 --> 36:50.940]  Watch this.
[36:50.940 --> 36:51.980]  And I go roll down your window.
[36:51.980 --> 36:53.460]  And he rolled down his window all the way.
[36:53.860 --> 36:54.940]  And I was in the right lane.
[36:54.940 --> 36:55.940]  He was in the left lane.
[36:56.140 --> 37:00.300]  He put his hand out and I threw that fucking joint from my car into his
[37:00.300 --> 37:02.300]  passenger window, directly into his hand.
[37:02.300 --> 37:05.220]  He caught that fucker and didn't have to make adjustments and just hit it.
[37:06.340 --> 37:07.340]  It was so smooth.
[37:07.660 --> 37:09.860]  They were so happy when they got to work that day.
[37:11.140 --> 37:12.980]  It was like Voltron just United, bro.
[37:12.980 --> 37:14.380]  We came together on that shit.
[37:14.380 --> 37:15.100]  It was beautiful.
[37:16.460 --> 37:19.740]  All right, you guys, I told my craziest story that I can think of.
[37:19.780 --> 37:20.140]  What's up?
[37:20.140 --> 37:21.780]  We didn't cover events really.
[37:22.500 --> 37:24.140]  I've seen people black the fuck out.
[37:24.180 --> 37:28.500]  Yeah, that's my friend Katrina took, uh, she took a dab and she looked at me.
[37:28.500 --> 37:32.180]  She goes, I'm so hungry and just fell the fuck over, dude.
[37:32.180 --> 37:35.340]  I caught her, but, uh, we stayed in a really swanky hotel the night
[37:35.340 --> 37:37.180]  before and they had free lotion.
[37:37.740 --> 37:40.260]  And, uh, she lubed herself up and all the damn lotion.
[37:40.260 --> 37:40.980]  She used it all.
[37:40.980 --> 37:44.100]  So I tried to catch her and it was trying to like, trying to catch a fucking
[37:44.100 --> 37:47.020]  slid right out of my arms, like, God damn it.
[37:47.020 --> 37:48.540]  So I had to catch her like three times.
[37:48.900 --> 37:50.340]  And then I finally got her all awkward.
[37:50.420 --> 37:53.620]  And Tony was with me and I go, Tony, just pick her up and put her on my
[37:53.620 --> 37:56.380]  shoulders, bro, because I was holding her just like, she was like a wet noodle.
[37:56.740 --> 37:58.580]  And so he spun her around and threw up on my shoulders.
[37:58.580 --> 38:00.660]  And now I got her and I spun her around and I told him,
[38:00.660 --> 38:02.020]  pour this water in her face.
[38:02.420 --> 38:04.980]  I just gave him water and he was like pouring water into her mouth.
[38:04.980 --> 38:07.620]  And she started drinking it and woke up and I set her down.
[38:07.620 --> 38:10.060]  She goes, how long was I asleep?
[38:11.980 --> 38:12.700]  That was pretty funny.
[38:12.700 --> 38:14.340]  She was all pale and shit for the rest of the day.
[38:14.340 --> 38:15.380]  We had to feed her twice.
[38:16.020 --> 38:19.700]  Uh, this dude from Texas one time I took a fat dab, a fat, fat
[38:19.700 --> 38:20.620]  dab at the cannabis cup.
[38:20.620 --> 38:23.100]  The first one that they did at the new location.
[38:23.660 --> 38:24.700]  Uh, what's a new place.
[38:24.700 --> 38:27.780]  Denver, Denver, Mart did a fatty location.
[38:28.260 --> 38:28.620]  Right?
[38:28.660 --> 38:29.180]  Oh shit.
[38:29.780 --> 38:30.780]  Did a big old fat dab.
[38:30.780 --> 38:32.340]  And this guy came up and he was from Texas.
[38:32.340 --> 38:33.500]  He's all, what y'all doing right there.
[38:33.500 --> 38:34.300]  And I was like, it's dad.
[38:34.340 --> 38:35.500]  He's like, damn, I heard about dads.
[38:35.500 --> 38:36.140]  Ain't done that yet.
[38:36.140 --> 38:36.860]  Can I get a dab?
[38:37.140 --> 38:38.340]  And I tried to give him a little dab.
[38:38.380 --> 38:41.020]  And I've told this story on the podcast before I tried to give him a little dab.
[38:41.660 --> 38:43.180]  And he's like, nah, I saw you do what I want.
[38:43.180 --> 38:43.500]  Big one.
[38:43.500 --> 38:44.060]  Like you did.
[38:44.060 --> 38:46.620]  And I was like, I don't think you want to do your first dad, like a
[38:46.660 --> 38:47.940]  Rostagef size dab.
[38:48.060 --> 38:49.300]  He's like, give me a damn old dab.
[38:49.700 --> 38:51.740]  And I was like, you're going to get a bad old dad, sir.
[38:51.740 --> 38:52.220]  Here you go.
[38:52.220 --> 38:54.580]  And so I hooked him up and that dude took a dab.
[38:55.020 --> 38:58.540]  And by the time the last of the smoke hit his lungs, I'm pretty sure part of the
[38:58.540 --> 39:01.620]  dad came out of that sinus part of your eye, like where your eye and your nose
[39:01.620 --> 39:03.180]  meets smoke came out there.
[39:03.180 --> 39:04.340]  Smoke came out of his ears.
[39:04.340 --> 39:05.500]  Smoke came out of his nose.
[39:05.780 --> 39:06.900]  Smoke came out of his mouth.
[39:07.180 --> 39:09.700]  If you'd have took off his pants and pretty sure some smoke was coming out of
[39:09.700 --> 39:10.180]  his butthole.
[39:10.180 --> 39:14.620]  Cause that dude was just, he just blew up with smoke and he looked at me and
[39:14.620 --> 39:15.100]  vanished.
[39:15.140 --> 39:16.260]  I don't know where the fuck he went.
[39:16.380 --> 39:17.540]  I don't know what happened to that dude.
[39:17.820 --> 39:19.460]  He just levitated into nowhere.
[39:19.460 --> 39:20.500]  He was gone, bro.
[39:20.500 --> 39:21.660]  That shit was so funny.
[39:21.700 --> 39:22.740]  Went back to his car.
[39:23.020 --> 39:24.380]  Probably instantly.
[39:24.420 --> 39:24.620]  Yeah.
[39:24.620 --> 39:25.300]  Drove right back.
[39:25.340 --> 39:26.220]  Wouldn't slept in the car.
[39:26.260 --> 39:26.420]  Yeah.
[39:26.420 --> 39:28.820]  Just the way that ran out of his car was what the hell was that?
[39:29.380 --> 39:30.740]  What did that Wookie just give me?
[39:30.980 --> 39:32.860]  And then he drove to Texas and told everybody about it.
[39:32.860 --> 39:33.580]  Yeah, Rasta Wizard.
[39:33.860 --> 39:34.860]  Rasta Wizard.
[39:34.860 --> 39:35.460]  Oh shit.
[39:35.460 --> 39:37.820]  Sometimes there'd be a nice offering you a tiny dab.
[39:37.940 --> 39:38.140]  Yeah.
[39:38.140 --> 39:40.940]  Don't don't, you don't have to take heroic dabs just cause I do.
[39:40.980 --> 39:42.100]  Don't mean you need to do it.
[39:42.220 --> 39:42.900]  Speaking of dads.
[39:42.900 --> 39:43.780]  I tell people all the time.
[39:43.860 --> 39:47.260]  Shout out to my friends at Turpex for the lovely work with the cascade
[39:47.260 --> 39:47.980]  shatter.
[39:48.500 --> 39:51.380]  Shouldn't even talk about it on the show since it's all sold the fuck out.
[39:51.660 --> 39:52.220]  The turps.
[39:52.220 --> 39:52.660]  Oh my God.
[39:52.660 --> 39:54.340]  You guys want to talk about these turps for a minute?
[39:55.100 --> 39:57.340]  I've been talking about the turps for a couple of few episodes now.
[39:57.340 --> 39:58.460]  I'm amazed that they're still around.
[39:58.460 --> 39:58.660]  Sorry.
[39:58.660 --> 39:59.540]  I'm wiggling my head funny.
[39:59.540 --> 40:00.780]  My hat is pulling my dread.
[40:00.820 --> 40:01.620]  I need to fix that.
[40:01.620 --> 40:03.820]  It's not a large container, but it lasts for a second.
[40:03.820 --> 40:05.100]  These turps are amazing.
[40:05.140 --> 40:06.700]  Did you guys get to try the lemon G?
[40:06.820 --> 40:07.180]  Yes.
[40:07.220 --> 40:08.700]  Did you get to try the OG Kush?
[40:08.700 --> 40:09.900]  I actually tried the lemon G.
[40:09.900 --> 40:10.740]  It's spelt in.
[40:10.820 --> 40:11.700]  Oh, okay.
[40:11.700 --> 40:13.180]  I don't think I tried the OG Kush.
[40:13.220 --> 40:15.700]  No, we may have to do some Duncan and Zip in here.
[40:15.700 --> 40:16.420]  That's so the ghost rhyme.
[40:16.500 --> 40:17.500]  Yeah, yesterday.
[40:17.500 --> 40:19.260]  You're going to have to lick the bottle if you want to taste that.
[40:19.260 --> 40:22.580]  I've tried the ghost, but the lemon G I've heard about, but haven't tried.
[40:22.660 --> 40:23.940]  The ghost was wonderful.
[40:24.020 --> 40:25.780]  We were talking about ways to use it earlier.
[40:25.780 --> 40:33.580]  I really like pouring the OG Kush turps onto solventless hash, like the 120
[40:33.580 --> 40:37.100]  micron cream or blue sherb hash.
[40:37.500 --> 40:38.340]  Yeah, just press out.
[40:38.340 --> 40:39.300]  See how this one's pressed right here?
[40:39.300 --> 40:40.420]  There's like a little patty.
[40:40.660 --> 40:42.420]  Just, just pour a little drip on there.
[40:42.860 --> 40:44.300]  It's pretty, uh, it's pretty thick.
[40:44.380 --> 40:46.340]  The turps are pretty thick and kind of viscous.
[40:46.340 --> 40:48.820]  So you've got to pour quickly or it'll run down the side of the bottle.
[40:49.180 --> 40:51.660]  You gotta learn to get the angle going, but I really love pouring
[40:51.660 --> 40:52.740]  it on the fucking solventless.
[40:53.220 --> 40:56.700]  Um, I poured some onto just a little piece of shatter the other day.
[40:56.700 --> 40:58.740]  And so that I had a whole piece of shatter with some on it.
[40:59.100 --> 41:00.780]  And of course some dripped onto the oil slick.
[41:01.020 --> 41:04.580]  So I was dipping it up, uh, using shatter and solventless and whatever I was smoking,
[41:04.580 --> 41:06.100]  just rubbing it in on the oil slick.
[41:06.380 --> 41:11.100]  My favorite way, honestly, is to get a, a small ish dab and then just
[41:11.100 --> 41:14.420]  dunk it right into the turps and don't even go too hard, just a little bit of
[41:14.420 --> 41:16.060]  turps and then just smoke it that way.
[41:16.060 --> 41:19.300]  I actually dropped a little bit of the, uh, ghost train haze turps
[41:19.300 --> 41:20.740]  directly onto the enail head.
[41:21.220 --> 41:24.660]  Made it, uh, made like the next five or six or eight dabs taste real turpy.
[41:24.860 --> 41:25.180]  Nice.
[41:25.220 --> 41:27.220]  It didn't last as long as I had hoped for.
[41:28.340 --> 41:31.660]  Um, Lindsay, you work at the store where we're selling this medically.
[41:31.660 --> 41:34.740]  What are these going for, for a quarter of a gram now?
[41:34.740 --> 41:35.300]  Do you remember?
[41:35.740 --> 41:36.660]  Think 60.
[41:36.660 --> 41:37.300]  I think you're right.
[41:37.300 --> 41:39.940]  I think there's 60 bucks, a quarter gram right now.
[41:40.380 --> 41:42.620]  They're on sale 65 for non-members.
[41:42.620 --> 41:43.340]  Just be a member.
[41:43.340 --> 41:44.140]  I don't know what you're thinking.
[41:44.140 --> 41:45.340]  You can get the blue shirt.
[41:45.380 --> 41:48.380]  If you get the cream sign up, I grew all that shit.
[41:48.380 --> 41:48.820]  You want it?
[41:48.820 --> 41:49.940]  Just come and get it.
[41:50.260 --> 41:52.020]  The turps turps are fucking amazing.
[41:52.020 --> 41:52.740]  You can get the turps.
[41:52.820 --> 41:55.940]  Uh, if you're a rec shopper, you can get the turps at Natty Rams call before you
[41:55.940 --> 41:58.660]  drive, because I don't know what they've got you guys when this episode comes out,
[41:58.660 --> 41:59.380]  they could be cleaned out.
[41:59.380 --> 42:00.140]  They could laugh at you.
[42:00.580 --> 42:01.700]  They can be like turps.
[42:01.740 --> 42:02.620]  That was a few weeks ago.
[42:02.620 --> 42:03.380]  Good fucking luck.
[42:03.940 --> 42:07.180]  But shout out to the crew that's making the turps shot to the Evo lab crew, because.
[42:07.740 --> 42:11.100]  Uh, we've seen a lot of really cool cannabis products come out in the past
[42:11.100 --> 42:12.740]  year, past two years, past whatever.
[42:13.180 --> 42:16.180]  And, uh, this one might be my favorite, the turps.
[42:16.740 --> 42:19.940]  This might be the newest, greatest thing to come out in cannabis.
[42:20.500 --> 42:21.180]  What do you think, Mike?
[42:22.260 --> 42:25.460]  There's been some stuff recently that's been impressive, but this
[42:25.460 --> 42:27.700]  kind of took it to another, a new place.
[42:28.660 --> 42:31.140]  A very fun, new place, a very connoisseur level.
[42:31.140 --> 42:33.260]  I like getting, I do like playing with the distillate.
[42:33.340 --> 42:37.140]  I like taking the distillate, the just a raw distillate, just 91%.
[42:37.460 --> 42:40.140]  THC and get a little tiny dab of that.
[42:40.140 --> 42:43.340]  And I like to dip it into the OG cushion and maybe put it in the lemon G after
[42:43.340 --> 42:45.660]  that, and then maybe rub it on the ghost train haze and just see what
[42:45.660 --> 42:46.700]  the different mixtures do.
[42:47.100 --> 42:49.500]  But that, that honestly, that got old quickly.
[42:49.540 --> 42:50.020]  It was fun.
[42:50.020 --> 42:50.580]  A few times.
[42:50.700 --> 42:52.460]  It was like, it was like mixing jelly bellies.
[42:53.380 --> 42:53.820]  You know what I'm saying?
[42:53.820 --> 42:56.060]  Like it's fun, but then you're like, eh, I did that.
[42:57.220 --> 43:01.740]  I, uh, I've been having some fun mixing random hashes together, playing
[43:01.740 --> 43:03.180]  with the different flavor profiles.
[43:03.180 --> 43:05.260]  Turp tacos combined.
[43:05.540 --> 43:06.020]  Combined.
[43:06.020 --> 43:06.620]  It was good, bro.
[43:07.460 --> 43:09.540]  Looking down this table folks.
[43:09.540 --> 43:12.060]  And there's like 12 different varieties of hash.
[43:12.060 --> 43:14.060]  There's three different vials of turps.
[43:14.100 --> 43:16.740]  There's four vials of turps.
[43:16.940 --> 43:19.740]  It's insanely delicious.
[43:19.940 --> 43:22.020]  Um, and distracting.
[43:22.060 --> 43:23.220]  It's a devilicious table.
[43:23.460 --> 43:23.860]  It is.
[43:23.860 --> 43:26.700]  And I've had, I've got this beautiful little pancake of solvent list.
[43:26.700 --> 43:28.340]  That's been taunting me this whole episode.
[43:28.380 --> 43:32.940]  If you smoke that whole thing, you may know that that's like at least 10
[43:32.940 --> 43:36.300]  Mike dabs on that little pancake, which is funny because that's like a quarter.
[43:36.340 --> 43:36.940]  Jeff dab.
[43:37.460 --> 43:37.740]  Yeah.
[43:37.780 --> 43:41.020]  Um, but easily I'd put a drop of OG Kush turps on it.
[43:41.020 --> 43:41.620]  That'd be one.
[43:41.620 --> 43:45.260]  So you started talking about dripping turps on it and I looked, I looked
[43:45.260 --> 43:46.980]  down and went, Ooh, God, sexier.
[43:49.260 --> 43:50.220]  That's where it combined.
[43:50.220 --> 43:50.900]  It came from.
[43:50.940 --> 43:54.100]  It's like giving, it's like giving a hash of boob job, put some turps on it.
[43:54.580 --> 43:56.140]  It's like putting wheels on that motherfucker.
[43:57.340 --> 43:58.460]  Oh, it's a Ram's on it.
[43:58.900 --> 44:00.060]  But they look nice.
[44:00.100 --> 44:01.500]  They don't gotta be spinners, bro.
[44:02.140 --> 44:03.660]  No one needs spinners anymore.
[44:03.740 --> 44:04.780]  Oh, well, kind of a nineties.
[44:04.780 --> 44:05.660]  Now that whistle.
[44:06.820 --> 44:07.140]  Yeah.
[44:08.940 --> 44:09.500]  All right.
[44:09.740 --> 44:12.420]  Uh, bubble, you got anything to add to this wonderful podcast?
[44:12.580 --> 44:13.740]  Not much, man.
[44:13.740 --> 44:15.140]  Thanks for the, the furniture table.
[44:15.140 --> 44:15.980]  Make sure you guys check out.

[44:20.540 --> 44:20.900]  All right.
[44:20.900 --> 44:22.820]  So burniture.bigcartel.com.

[44:25.340 --> 44:25.660]  Do it.
[44:26.060 --> 44:28.220]  He's a bad mo for a contact him for custom art.
[44:28.220 --> 44:29.780]  There's a whole bunch of email furniture.
[44:29.820 --> 44:30.260]  Definitely.
[44:30.260 --> 44:30.420]  Yeah.
[44:30.420 --> 44:31.420]  I go check out the site.
[44:31.460 --> 44:33.620]  How long ago did you hook me up with that email table?
[44:33.660 --> 44:34.420]  It's been a while now.
[44:34.420 --> 44:35.420]  It's been over a year.
[44:35.460 --> 44:35.700]  Yeah.
[44:35.700 --> 44:36.180]  Easily.
[44:36.180 --> 44:36.820]  And it works.
[44:36.860 --> 44:37.540]  It still works.
[44:37.540 --> 44:38.460]  I ain't got no problems.
[44:38.460 --> 44:39.660]  The coils are still good.
[44:39.660 --> 44:40.340]  The workhorse.
[44:40.340 --> 44:41.420]  And it's like one of the.
[44:42.020 --> 44:45.380]  When the original is to the paint, the paint needs a hug.
[44:45.580 --> 44:45.820]  Yeah.
[44:45.820 --> 44:49.660]  But I mean, everything else is got some miles on those tires now.
[44:49.700 --> 44:49.940]  Yeah.
[44:49.940 --> 44:51.460]  We've, we've done, I've done a lot of videos.
[44:51.460 --> 44:52.380]  My favorite thing.
[44:52.380 --> 44:55.380]  I sent it here to make sure it got put to work.
[44:55.380 --> 44:58.940]  That was like, that was like, I literally, that was probably like the third or
[44:58.940 --> 44:59.460]  fourth one.
[44:59.460 --> 45:02.740]  And I was like, I'm going to send this to Jeff because I know he's gonna.
[45:02.820 --> 45:03.660]  It got a lot of use.
[45:03.660 --> 45:04.860]  It's got a lot of miles on it.
[45:04.900 --> 45:07.540]  The coils are still working and I'm amazed because I've used a couple of
[45:07.540 --> 45:10.420]  coils on this unit here in the same amount of time.
[45:10.540 --> 45:10.820]  I don't know.
[45:10.820 --> 45:12.100]  These coils aren't as good.
[45:12.100 --> 45:14.260]  I don't think I like the ones that look more like a microphone.
[45:14.260 --> 45:16.540]  You guys, if you're buying an email, get the one with the coil that looks
[45:16.540 --> 45:19.900]  like a microphone cable, not the one that XLR.
[45:19.980 --> 45:20.220]  Yeah.
[45:20.220 --> 45:22.020]  It looks like an XLR cable, not the other one.
[45:22.020 --> 45:22.820]  You'll know what I'm talking about.
[45:22.820 --> 45:25.260]  If it doesn't look like XLR, that's not the one I'm talking about.
[45:26.260 --> 45:26.740]  Don't do it.
[45:26.820 --> 45:27.740]  That five pin.
[45:27.820 --> 45:28.940]  Actually, are you all right?
[45:29.020 --> 45:29.340]  Yeah.
[45:29.340 --> 45:33.260]  I was just thinking to myself that I remember when you were making that table
[45:33.260 --> 45:37.420]  in Florida, like I remember you and I trying to figure out how you were going
[45:37.420 --> 45:41.140]  to paint it and you doing the, um, tape on the top.
[45:41.180 --> 45:41.660]  Yeah.
[45:41.660 --> 45:46.900]  And the tape, uh, when you pulled it off or whatever, and that's the reason you
[45:46.900 --> 45:51.660]  painted it because you originally were going to do something on it.
[45:51.700 --> 45:56.460]  And when you pulled up the paint, that's right.
[45:56.740 --> 46:00.540]  And then when you, when you put the tape down and you pulled it up, it's fucked
[46:00.540 --> 46:03.020]  up and you were like, that's it.
[46:03.020 --> 46:04.740]  I'm just going to do Jeff's thing on there.
[46:05.500 --> 46:06.900]  Now I'm going balls deep.
[46:06.980 --> 46:10.340]  I did it really dope unboxing video on Periscope.
[46:10.340 --> 46:12.380]  And yeah, I remember I watched that.
[46:12.380 --> 46:12.660]  Yeah.
[46:12.660 --> 46:17.540]  I was actually at her job, I think, or I was walking in your job and we watched it
[46:17.540 --> 46:19.340]  when I was at, cause I was like driving.
[46:19.340 --> 46:20.580]  I was like, well, Jeff just got it.
[46:20.580 --> 46:21.060]  Sweet.
[46:22.740 --> 46:23.940]  The video may be on YouTube.
[46:23.940 --> 46:24.460]  I'm not sure.
[46:24.460 --> 46:27.300]  I can't promise you the unboxing video could be up there.
[46:27.540 --> 46:27.940]  Yeah.
[46:28.060 --> 46:30.420]  I think you, uh, oh, Lindsay needs a nap.
[46:30.460 --> 46:30.980]  I really do.
[46:30.980 --> 46:31.780]  Good morning, sunshine.
[46:31.820 --> 46:32.060]  Sorry.
[46:32.060 --> 46:33.060]  We woke you up for this.
[46:33.460 --> 46:33.900]  What was it?
[46:33.900 --> 46:35.700]  Five or 600 or four or 500?
[46:35.740 --> 46:37.020]  Uh, four or 500.
[46:37.220 --> 46:39.580]  So doing all right though for 500 milligrams.
[46:40.060 --> 46:41.660]  I ate, um, power nap.
[46:41.700 --> 46:41.900]  Yeah.
[46:41.900 --> 46:43.100]  I was going to say I had a power.
[46:43.140 --> 46:47.540]  I probably used somewhere between like eight and 1200 milligrams of THC during
[46:47.540 --> 46:49.540]  the last secret sesh and that was on what?
[46:49.540 --> 46:50.420]  421?
[46:50.660 --> 46:51.100]  No.
[46:51.100 --> 46:55.580]  Um, the last one we had in may, may 23rd, I think maybe something ish.
[46:55.580 --> 46:56.100]  It was in may.
[46:56.100 --> 46:56.420]  Damn it.
[46:56.420 --> 46:58.020]  I don't care what date it was that day.
[46:58.020 --> 46:58.860]  I ate a whole bunch.
[46:59.220 --> 47:02.060]  And then somebody gave me a thousand milligram edible at that event.
[47:02.060 --> 47:03.420]  And I ate that the next day.
[47:03.780 --> 47:04.060]  Yeah.
[47:04.060 --> 47:06.860]  I actually ended up getting one of those and I'm mad because I've been
[47:06.860 --> 47:11.740]  wanting to like eat a thousand and I didn't cause she ended up like, whoa,
[47:11.820 --> 47:15.660]  no, wait, let me, let me tell you the story.
[47:17.660 --> 47:22.060]  I gave him this thousand milligram bar and I was like, yo, surprise.
[47:22.060 --> 47:25.740]  I finally got you one that you've, we've been like talking about forever.
[47:26.180 --> 47:27.740]  What does this idiot do?
[47:28.020 --> 47:29.220]  He opens it.
[47:29.260 --> 47:30.740]  Like he's like, Oh sweet.
[47:30.940 --> 47:36.060]  Grabs the grabs it from me, opens it up, breaks off two of them, throws it in his
[47:36.060 --> 47:37.820]  mouth immediately.
[47:39.660 --> 47:40.580]  No warning.
[47:40.620 --> 47:42.180]  And he's like three bites in.
[47:42.180 --> 47:43.620]  He looks over at me all wide.
[47:43.620 --> 47:46.380]  I was like, Oh, why did I do that?
[47:46.700 --> 47:47.500]  It's a habit.
[47:47.740 --> 47:49.340]  I have no idea why you did that.
[47:49.340 --> 47:50.980]  That smelled so good.
[47:51.020 --> 47:52.020]  Oh, let me just try this.
[47:52.300 --> 47:53.420]  And I was like, why did I eat this?
[47:53.420 --> 47:54.700]  I just want to eat all this right now.
[47:54.700 --> 47:55.660]  And I can right now.
[47:55.660 --> 47:56.220]  I did.
[47:56.740 --> 48:01.020]  And I know I kind of wish I would not have ankle weights on your brain, right?
[48:01.020 --> 48:01.980]  That's what it felt like.
[48:02.020 --> 48:02.260]  Yes.
[48:02.260 --> 48:02.900]  On Facebook.
[48:02.900 --> 48:04.660]  I said, it's like ankle weights for your brain.
[48:04.660 --> 48:06.140]  So hashy.
[48:06.220 --> 48:08.220]  Dude, that was the most hash.
[48:09.100 --> 48:10.660]  My teeth were sticking together.
[48:10.660 --> 48:18.700]  They were making this like a half pieces were really hashy.
[48:18.700 --> 48:21.540]  So like, I was eating it while I was driving.
[48:21.540 --> 48:22.860]  So I was just pounding their hash.
[48:22.900 --> 48:23.660]  That's exactly.
[48:23.700 --> 48:24.100]  Okay.
[48:24.140 --> 48:25.340]  That's exactly what I did.
[48:25.380 --> 48:28.140]  It was like, yeah, you can taste it.
[48:28.180 --> 48:32.020]  They told me, uh, uh, Max, what's the fucking dude's name?
[48:32.020 --> 48:32.500]  Max, right?
[48:33.020 --> 48:36.300]  He told me he put a gram and a half of shatter in each bar.
[48:36.500 --> 48:39.380]  So that means I ate a gram and a half of shatter in a chocolate bar.
[48:39.380 --> 48:42.100]  That was really no bigger than six pieces.
[48:42.100 --> 48:44.660]  Like, yeah, there's eight pieces.
[48:45.540 --> 48:45.780]  Wow.
[48:45.780 --> 48:48.980]  Wait, if it's a gram and a half, then isn't that more than a thousand?
[48:48.980 --> 48:51.260]  Well, no, because that's something that we should talk about on the podcast.
[48:51.260 --> 48:52.540]  We have a lot more time to get that.
[48:52.540 --> 48:52.780]  Sure.
[48:52.780 --> 48:53.340]  Oh, that's right.
[48:53.340 --> 48:57.140]  Because a gram of hash, if you test this hash, this is not 100% THC.
[48:57.140 --> 48:58.780]  This is probably in the high eighties.
[48:58.780 --> 49:01.220]  So they threw a gram and a half in there and they're calling it.
[49:01.300 --> 49:01.700]  Okay.
[49:01.900 --> 49:02.180]  Yeah.
[49:02.580 --> 49:04.820]  So it's a much truer ballpark.
[49:05.180 --> 49:05.500]  Yeah.
[49:05.540 --> 49:05.780]  Yeah.
[49:05.780 --> 49:09.020]  Well, they, they couldn't be tested by the MED and they couldn't,
[49:09.020 --> 49:10.380]  they aren't an MED product.
[49:10.420 --> 49:13.060]  These are just somebody's basement brew, right?
[49:13.300 --> 49:14.300]  Home concoctions.
[49:14.340 --> 49:17.860]  I miss the days when anyone could use lab testing.
[49:18.220 --> 49:22.420]  We only had those days for about two and a half, three months, but it was
[49:22.980 --> 49:23.780]  a chunk of time.
[49:26.860 --> 49:27.660]  Big shout out to the end.
[49:27.660 --> 49:31.580]  The, and the fuck I totally wish I could remember the, uh, the chemist
[49:31.580 --> 49:35.500]  named the scientist that I met when I know his name, it's right on the tip
[49:35.500 --> 49:36.500]  of my tongue, dammit.
[49:36.500 --> 49:39.340]  As soon as we quit recording, I'm going to yell his name out loud, man.
[49:39.340 --> 49:39.980]  He was a cool dude.
[49:40.100 --> 49:41.340]  The scientist I made at steep hill.
[49:41.380 --> 49:43.540]  He really taught me a lot of stuff in the short amount of time we hung out.
[49:43.940 --> 49:45.620]  Steep Hill was the first group.
[49:45.820 --> 49:50.820]  I mean, way back at the first Cush con, they had like the saddest little booth
[49:50.900 --> 49:54.860]  at the show with the coolest information pack.
[49:55.340 --> 50:01.060]  Um, they were the first people I really saw breaking down cannabis testing past
[50:01.060 --> 50:01.660]  THC.
[50:02.460 --> 50:07.020]  Um, they were advertising pesticides, heavy metals, uh, like 12 different
[50:07.020 --> 50:08.260]  cannabinoids at that point.
[50:08.940 --> 50:12.620]  Um, and I just, it was one of those things where you saw, Oh, that that's
[50:12.620 --> 50:14.020]  where the industry is going to go.
[50:14.460 --> 50:20.100]  This is going to open up all new avenues, insure shit, uh, potency jump 20%.
[50:20.740 --> 50:22.020]  Uh, quality went up.
[50:22.700 --> 50:26.140]  I mean, an incalculable amount right after the lab showed up.
[50:26.220 --> 50:28.660]  Shout out to Johnny Trill and Trill gardens.
[50:28.780 --> 50:30.180]  Uh, they had their shit tested.
[50:30.540 --> 50:33.660]  Zero traces of any pesticides and all of them.
[50:35.140 --> 50:35.340]  Yeah.
[50:35.340 --> 50:36.340]  Big shout out to those kids.
[50:36.780 --> 50:38.700]  I saw a test like that on Facebook or something.
[50:38.740 --> 50:40.380]  I think that's the same test I'm talking about.
[50:40.420 --> 50:40.700]  Yeah.
[50:40.860 --> 50:41.100]  Yeah.
[50:41.540 --> 50:45.300]  Uh, so I, I was getting around to, I haven't eaten edibles since that thousand
[50:45.300 --> 50:46.980]  milligram cause I'm a little scared.
[50:48.340 --> 50:49.420]  I fell off the horse.
[50:50.220 --> 50:51.340]  I ain't got back on yet.
[50:51.860 --> 50:54.940]  Actually, I've been highly into edibles lately.
[50:55.020 --> 51:00.300]  Ever since I went to Florida, I overroasted myself with them when I went to see
[51:00.300 --> 51:04.260]  Deadpool and I've been going real light since I just needed a reset for a little
[51:04.260 --> 51:04.540]  while.
[51:04.620 --> 51:05.540]  I just needed a minute.
[51:05.660 --> 51:08.420]  I'll probably eat a whole bunch of edibles again at the next secret sesh.
[51:08.420 --> 51:08.820]  Yeah.
[51:08.900 --> 51:10.820]  I wonder if this podcast comes out before then.
[51:10.820 --> 51:13.900]  No, this podcast will not be out by the time secret sesh happens.
[51:14.180 --> 51:17.100]  And if it did, we will do a review of it on an, everyone looks at their phone.
[51:17.940 --> 51:19.380]  How many days until this episode?
[51:19.380 --> 51:21.660]  How many tests you could say, let's do quick math on our fingers.
[51:22.420 --> 51:23.980]  I don't even know, but check out secret sessions.
[51:23.980 --> 51:26.260]  The only way to get into a secret session is to follow the instructions
[51:26.260 --> 51:27.540]  of follow instructions.
[51:27.540 --> 51:32.340]  So either if it's already happened or not check out a secret at secret sesh
[51:32.380 --> 51:34.220]  underscore CEO on Instagram.
[51:34.220 --> 51:37.100]  And if you ever want to come join us, the instructions will be posted there.
[51:37.460 --> 51:38.460]  Follow the instructions.
[51:38.620 --> 51:40.460]  If you fuck it up, you won't get to go.
[51:40.620 --> 51:41.620]  That's just a simple email.
[51:41.660 --> 51:42.780]  You got to follow the instructions.
[51:42.940 --> 51:45.100]  A lot of people do something stupidly wrong.
[51:45.100 --> 51:46.380]  And then like, why didn't I get my tickets?
[51:46.420 --> 51:49.060]  And then we go look at their email and like, cause you didn't put your name on
[51:49.060 --> 51:51.460]  it and you didn't show your ID like you're supposed to.
[51:51.820 --> 51:54.660]  So yeah, you just got to do this shit properly and you will get in.
[51:56.060 --> 51:56.420]  All right.
[51:56.900 --> 51:57.860]  Shout out to the secret session.
[51:57.860 --> 51:58.580]  We just went quiet.
[51:58.620 --> 51:59.100]  For sure.
[51:59.260 --> 52:01.620]  Lindsay, got any more useful information for this podcast?
[52:02.180 --> 52:03.220]  No, not really.
[52:03.260 --> 52:08.260]  I mean, I have like a thousand stories I can tell you of just obscene things
[52:08.260 --> 52:12.180]  people have said and done, but you know, like when people ridiculously
[52:12.180 --> 52:13.460]  blatantly does flirt with you.
[52:14.380 --> 52:15.740]  Yeah, there's, there's that.
[52:15.740 --> 52:19.700]  There's, um, when I was working in the smoke shop, I had someone come up, come
[52:19.700 --> 52:22.460]  in and be like, oh, are you the trap queen?
[52:22.580 --> 52:22.940]  What?
[52:23.220 --> 52:23.460]  No.
[52:23.700 --> 52:26.100]  Shout out to my boy sloppy for making a really great joke in the
[52:26.100 --> 52:26.940]  dispensary the other day.
[52:26.940 --> 52:28.020]  We're not going to repeat any of that.
[52:28.020 --> 52:30.140]  We won't go there, but that's fucking golden.
[52:30.140 --> 52:30.820]  Shout out slop.
[52:30.820 --> 52:32.180]  I hope you listen to this podcast.
[52:32.500 --> 52:33.420]  I heard what you said.
[52:34.700 --> 52:35.140]  My friend,
[52:36.380 --> 52:36.980]  that was
[52:37.180 --> 52:38.780]  shout out for killing it out there on the mountain, bro.
[52:38.780 --> 52:41.260]  You said you were going to do something and motherfucker you were doing it.
[52:41.340 --> 52:42.660]  Yeah, man.
[52:43.180 --> 52:43.780]  Doing it.
[52:43.820 --> 52:44.900]  Proud, proud of you, bro.
[52:45.020 --> 52:45.500]  Proud of you.
[52:46.020 --> 52:47.460]  He was a youngster when he moved here.
[52:47.660 --> 52:48.100]  You know what I'm saying?
[52:48.100 --> 52:50.780]  Like sloppy was kind of just getting his feet wet when he moved here.
[52:51.100 --> 52:53.940]  Well, I got to meet you and slop right.
[52:53.940 --> 52:55.660]  Like right when he like first moved here.
[52:56.460 --> 52:57.780]  When the Fong days,
[52:57.820 --> 52:59.820]  Fong, Fong Nguyen, bro.
[52:59.820 --> 53:01.300]  Fong, I hope you listen to the podcast.
[53:01.300 --> 53:03.380]  I have no idea, but either way, shout out to Fong Nguyen.
[53:03.700 --> 53:04.180]  Check him out.
[53:04.180 --> 53:04.740]  He's a good dude.
[53:04.740 --> 53:05.380]  He does some art.
[53:06.660 --> 53:07.060]  Great art.
[53:07.100 --> 53:08.660]  He made me a Chewbacca torch.
[53:09.020 --> 53:09.820]  That Chewbacca torch.
[53:09.820 --> 53:10.620]  Is that what that came from?
[53:10.620 --> 53:11.740]  That came from Fong Nguyen.
[53:11.780 --> 53:14.300]  That's his, his sculpture, his artwork right there.
[53:14.660 --> 53:15.020]  All right, guys.
[53:15.020 --> 53:16.380]  I think it's time to wrap up the podcast.
[53:16.380 --> 53:17.540]  Everybody here's dabbed the fuck out.
[53:17.580 --> 53:18.780]  We're going to take some more dabs for you.
[53:18.940 --> 53:22.100]  Somebody dab while I start talking and rambling so that we can hear people cough.
[53:22.100 --> 53:24.020]  Maybe give Mike a dab so he can cough on the show.
[53:24.100 --> 53:26.060]  We've all been staring at those turds.
[53:26.060 --> 53:28.060]  Do you have any of that Lemon G Rude Boy by chance?
[53:28.140 --> 53:30.620]  Um, I do have some of the Lemon G Rude Boy.
[53:30.620 --> 53:31.580]  It is in this pile.
[53:31.580 --> 53:33.900]  We just got to dig through these piles of hashes.
[53:34.220 --> 53:35.140]  Look at this right here, bro.
[53:35.140 --> 53:35.940]  Lemon G.
[53:35.940 --> 53:37.100]  I was just snagging a little piece of it.
[53:37.100 --> 53:38.740]  Yeah, for, well, I mean, we can split this, Mike.
[53:38.740 --> 53:39.300]  Don't be sad.
[53:39.300 --> 53:41.180]  Lemon OG Shatter, Rude Boy, and Lemon G.
[53:41.420 --> 53:42.100]  Take a dab, bro.
[53:42.740 --> 53:43.460]  You're as big as you.
[53:43.460 --> 53:44.900]  I'm not going to gobble it all up.

[53:55.940 --> 53:56.860]  We're not going to do that again.
[53:57.860 --> 54:00.580]  I laughed so hard when I heard that.

[54:38.900 --> 54:40.380]  I don't mess with that one very much.
[54:40.780 --> 54:41.500]  Green Door.
[54:41.500 --> 54:42.420]  I don't think I've heard of that.
[54:42.460 --> 54:42.860]  It's fun.
[54:42.860 --> 54:43.780]  Shout out to Emily Hyde.
[54:43.780 --> 54:45.860]  She's the one that runs that does a lot of stuff with that.
[54:45.860 --> 54:47.020]  She's the one that introduced me to it.
[54:47.020 --> 54:48.700]  She gave me a bunch of tokens to get started.
[54:48.940 --> 54:50.300]  It's a token based system.
[54:50.300 --> 54:52.220]  If you, uh, go for that one.
[54:52.980 --> 54:53.460]  Trust me.
[54:54.580 --> 54:54.780]  Yeah.
[54:54.780 --> 54:55.140]  Trust me.
[54:55.140 --> 54:55.500]  Go for that.
[54:55.500 --> 54:56.660]  I haven't tried the, sorry.
[54:56.660 --> 54:58.380]  I haven't tried the OG Kush yet.
[54:58.380 --> 54:59.980]  So you want, Oh, do it.
[55:00.140 --> 55:01.860]  No, I'm asking, is it worth it?
[55:01.860 --> 55:03.060]  Or is that lemon?
[55:03.380 --> 55:05.100]  I got to try the lemon yesterday.
[55:05.100 --> 55:07.780]  Do it then go for the OG, but you would prefer the lemon G.
[55:07.780 --> 55:08.260]  No, I would.
[55:08.260 --> 55:08.460]  Okay.
[55:08.460 --> 55:08.740]  That's fine.
[55:08.740 --> 55:09.140]  Trust me.
[55:09.180 --> 55:09.620]  That's fine.
[55:09.620 --> 55:09.820]  I'll wait.
[55:09.820 --> 55:11.660]  That's why there's so much of which one left.
[55:12.180 --> 55:14.060]  I got a freshie of the ghost train Hayes over here.
[55:14.060 --> 55:16.020]  If we have to do that too, he pulled out.
[55:16.020 --> 55:17.180]  It's not going to fit in there, bro.
[55:17.180 --> 55:18.060]  What are you trying to do?
[55:18.260 --> 55:20.180]  I know I'm trying to play operation over here.
[55:20.220 --> 55:21.060]  Back to kindergarten.
[55:21.140 --> 55:22.580]  The block doesn't hit the buzzer.
[55:24.220 --> 55:24.740]  There you go.
[55:25.180 --> 55:25.740]  Uh, be quick.
[55:25.740 --> 55:26.700]  Cause it'll stick to the jar.
[55:27.060 --> 55:28.460]  Boba Blastico on the dunk.
[55:28.780 --> 55:30.420]  Um, what else do we got?
[55:30.420 --> 55:30.940]  Social media.
[55:30.940 --> 55:31.740]  That's where we were.
[55:31.740 --> 55:32.540]  We were on social media.
[55:32.540 --> 55:33.780]  I think that's all I've got for you guys.
[55:34.100 --> 55:35.700]  Shout out to my buddy, Fred Garvin.
[55:36.340 --> 55:39.620]  Uh, Fred Garvin, you send me a lot of useful tips and questions and stuff.
[55:39.620 --> 55:40.420]  You keep the show moving.
[55:40.420 --> 55:42.420]  Anybody else that you got emails, send them to me.
[55:42.420 --> 55:43.660]  I would love to hear from you.
[55:43.660 --> 55:44.460]  I think that's all I've got.
[55:44.460 --> 55:45.780]  These guys are rambling a whole bunch in here.
[55:46.220 --> 55:46.940]  Uh, we're going to end up.
[55:47.180 --> 55:48.860]  And it's about to get real turpy.
[55:48.860 --> 55:49.740]  It's about to get turpy.
[55:49.740 --> 55:50.980]  We're all going to take some lemon G turps.
[55:50.980 --> 55:52.660]  Somebody else is going to join us at the table real quick.
[55:52.660 --> 55:54.420]  I assume that's a leap toward the table.
[55:54.900 --> 55:57.260]  Uh, shout out to everybody that listened to the podcast.
[55:57.260 --> 55:59.060]  Shout out to everybody that supports the podcast.
[55:59.060 --> 56:01.100]  Shout out to everybody that supports the legalization of
[56:01.100 --> 56:03.380]  cannabis nation, motherfucking wide.
[56:03.700 --> 56:04.260]  I love you guys all.
[56:04.260 --> 56:05.900]  Like you're my own adopted children.
[56:06.340 --> 56:07.660]  Um, shout out to my ninja Spence.
[56:07.660 --> 56:11.820]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[56:24.610 --> 56:37.170]  Try your best just to make it quick.
[56:37.210 --> 56:39.890]  There must be something she can do.
[56:41.690 --> 56:50.180]  This heart is broke.
[56:50.420 --> 56:53.500]  Tell her it's a case of emergency.
[56:54.860 --> 56:55.780]  There's a patient.
[57:02.900 --> 57:03.300]  Night.
[57:21.250 --> 57:23.890]  Oh, the pain is getting worse.
[57:29.140 --> 57:30.900]  I don't want to see no doc.
[57:33.860 --> 57:37.300]  I need attendance from my nurse around the clock.
[57:42.340 --> 57:44.940]  Cause there's no prescription for me.
[57:46.700 --> 57:50.140]  She's the one, the only remedy.
[58:00.100 --> 58:02.380]  Only you alone can quench this.
[58:18.720 --> 58:20.240]  I'm hurt by love.
[58:34.030 --> 58:35.670]  Don't wanna see no dog.
[58:37.990 --> 58:41.550]  I need attendance from my nurse around the clock.
[58:46.430 --> 58:49.030]  Cause there's no prescription for me.
[58:51.230 --> 58:54.510]  She's the one, the only remedy.
[58:57.150 --> 59:06.990]  Can quench this yet.
[59:11.430 --> 59:12.230]  My night.
[59:22.180 --> 59:25.380]  I'm hurt by love.
[59:36.610 --> 59:37.170]  No doubt.
