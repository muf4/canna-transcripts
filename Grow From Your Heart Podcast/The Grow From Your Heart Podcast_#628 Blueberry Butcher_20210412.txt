[00:06.640 --> 00:12.300]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 628 of the Grow From Your
[00:12.300 --> 00:13.800]  Heart podcast.
[00:13.800 --> 00:18.200]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about a new strain that I'm releasing for 420.
[00:18.200 --> 00:22.600]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 club.
[00:22.600 --> 00:27.440]  Of course, the 710 club are those folks who support us on Patreon at the $7 and 10 cent
[00:27.440 --> 00:29.120]  a month level or higher.
[00:29.120 --> 00:33.180]  So with no further ado, let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[00:59.800 --> 01:00.800]  Thank you.
[01:00.800 --> 01:05.520]  Shout out and a fist bump to my buddy, Brett G. Big thanks and big shout out to everybody

[01:35.000 --> 01:37.200]  That link will be there for you later.
[01:37.200 --> 01:40.640]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:40.640 --> 01:42.600]  All right, welcome to the show everybody.
[01:42.600 --> 01:46.640]  In this episode, we are going to focus on a new strain which I'm going to release for
[01:46.640 --> 01:47.720]  420.
[01:47.720 --> 01:51.320]  Let's talk about a couple of other things before we get to that strain highlight.
[01:51.320 --> 01:57.200]  In a previous episode, I did talk about finding a male plant out of a pack of feminized seeds.
[01:57.200 --> 01:58.720]  I talked about how rare that could be.
[01:58.720 --> 02:00.960]  I talked about the opportunities for that.
[02:00.960 --> 02:02.720]  I was enlightened by a great friend.
[02:02.720 --> 02:03.840]  I don't know if they want a shout out.
[02:03.840 --> 02:07.480]  I don't know if they want their business out there, but I'm just going to say that I was
[02:07.480 --> 02:14.800]  educated about a very great male plant that came from feminized seed stock.
[02:14.800 --> 02:16.920]  Somebody had seeds.
[02:16.920 --> 02:18.360]  They had a plant that they loved.
[02:18.360 --> 02:19.800]  They couldn't get to that plant anymore.
[02:19.800 --> 02:20.800]  It was taken from them.
[02:20.800 --> 02:21.800]  They had seed stock.
[02:21.800 --> 02:23.560]  They had feminized seeds.
[02:23.560 --> 02:28.640]  Within that fem stock, they did find a male and they used that male to make more seeds.
[02:28.640 --> 02:34.520]  It makes regular seeds, but those regular seeds do seem to put out a higher ratio of
[02:34.520 --> 02:36.400]  females.
[02:36.400 --> 02:37.400]  There has been a discovery.
[02:37.400 --> 02:38.400]  I've been educated.
[02:38.400 --> 02:39.600]  I've been updated.
[02:39.600 --> 02:43.560]  There is a likelihood of a male popping up in female stock.
[02:43.560 --> 02:50.360]  When it does, sometimes it has proven itself to be a very useful tool for a good breeder.
[02:50.920 --> 02:52.400]  I wanted to share with you.
[02:52.400 --> 02:56.840]  Also, we talked about using spent barley in a previous episode.
[02:56.840 --> 03:01.240]  A listener asked about using spent barley from a grow, from a brewery to use that in
[03:01.240 --> 03:02.240]  a commercial grow.
[03:02.240 --> 03:04.120]  They said there's a bunch of stuff left over.
[03:04.120 --> 03:08.920]  I got mixed reviews and mixed emotions in response to using the spent barley.
[03:08.920 --> 03:11.560]  Some people said, you're going to get way too many bugs.
[03:11.560 --> 03:12.560]  They said they tried it.
[03:12.560 --> 03:13.560]  They had too many bugs.
[03:13.560 --> 03:14.960]  It had too many sugars.
[03:14.960 --> 03:17.680]  Other people said they do it and it works beautifully.
[03:17.680 --> 03:19.560]  I got both sides of that story.
[03:19.560 --> 03:24.280]  I believe both of those people because who knows what the other factors were that could
[03:24.280 --> 03:25.800]  have contributed to that.
[03:25.800 --> 03:28.360]  I did hear positives and negatives.
[03:28.360 --> 03:32.560]  I wanted to make sure to update you guys and share that with you because I like the feedback.
[03:32.560 --> 03:33.560]  I like the info.
[03:33.560 --> 03:37.800]  The people that replied are great people in the industry that I greatly respect and trust.
[03:37.800 --> 03:40.080]  Wanted to share that info.
[03:40.080 --> 03:43.040]  Another thing I want to talk about is the Discord channel.
[03:43.040 --> 03:48.480]  You guys, the Iry Genetics Grow From Your Heart podcast, the Rasta Jeff Discord channel
[03:48.520 --> 03:49.520]  has exploded.
[03:49.520 --> 03:52.280]  There are so many members, users, viewers, visitors.
[03:52.280 --> 03:53.880]  The community is huge.
[03:53.880 --> 03:55.400]  It is out of control.
[03:55.400 --> 03:58.600]  I'm going to ask you guys one time, just play nicely.
[03:58.600 --> 03:59.600]  Be kind over there.
[03:59.600 --> 04:04.240]  I'm pretty sure everybody listening, watching, participating now is totally kind and totally
[04:04.240 --> 04:05.240]  cool.
[04:05.240 --> 04:10.320]  But as the leader of the Iry Army, the guy whose name is on that fucking Discord, I just
[04:10.320 --> 04:12.840]  want to ask you one time, just be nice.
[04:12.840 --> 04:17.600]  You guys are indirectly representing me and it turns out you are directly representing
[04:17.720 --> 04:19.360]  me in some people's eyes.
[04:19.360 --> 04:23.600]  Just remember, some of the shit you say over there could be taken askew, could be taken
[04:23.600 --> 04:28.960]  wrong and it could accidentally represent the Iry Army in a negative light.
[04:28.960 --> 04:33.240]  Keep that in mind when you're posting, commenting, scrolling and trolling.
[04:33.240 --> 04:37.680]  Honestly, you guys do your thing being adult, but keep in mind you are on a public forum.
[04:37.680 --> 04:39.280]  Some people might get salty.
[04:39.280 --> 04:40.280]  Let's just be nice.
[04:40.280 --> 04:42.400]  Also, if you get upset, I can't babysit everybody.
[04:42.400 --> 04:43.440]  There's a lot of people over there.
[04:43.440 --> 04:44.520]  It's the internet.
[04:44.520 --> 04:46.440]  Show me where the internet hurt you today.
[04:46.440 --> 04:47.840]  Let's play nice, you guys.
[04:47.840 --> 04:48.840]  Let's play nice.
[04:48.840 --> 04:49.840]  Let's be all inclusive.
[04:49.840 --> 04:52.040]  I don't condone promote.
[04:52.040 --> 04:54.260]  I'm not down with any bullshit.
[04:54.260 --> 04:57.560]  No racism, none of that crap.
[04:57.560 --> 05:01.000]  We're not going to segregate or discriminate anybody over there.
[05:01.000 --> 05:02.600]  Everybody's there to have a good time.
[05:02.600 --> 05:03.600]  Let's just focus on that.
[05:03.600 --> 05:05.840]  I've already given it way too much attention.
[05:05.840 --> 05:10.040]  Let's move forward to the main topic of today's podcast.
[05:10.040 --> 05:12.240]  Let's get ready to ramble.
[05:12.240 --> 05:15.180]  I said at the top of the show, we're going to talk about a strain that I'm going to release
[05:15.180 --> 05:16.720]  for 420.
[05:16.720 --> 05:24.020]  That strain is the blueberry cookies crossed to Jack the Ripper.
[05:24.020 --> 05:26.780]  Let me back up one step just in case you're not aware.
[05:26.780 --> 05:28.360]  I am Rosted Jeff.
[05:28.360 --> 05:33.220]  Not only am I the host and producer of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, also I breed
[05:33.220 --> 05:34.220]  seeds.
[05:34.220 --> 05:35.740]  I am the sole proprietor.
[05:35.740 --> 05:38.180]  I am iReed Genetics Premium Seeds.
[05:38.180 --> 05:39.180]  It's just me.
[05:39.180 --> 05:44.420]  I do everything from the breeding, the selecting, the packaging, the social media stuff, the
[05:44.420 --> 05:45.420]  email stuff.
[05:45.420 --> 05:46.420]  It is all just me.
[05:46.420 --> 05:49.700]  With that being said, if you're sending me emails and I'm not responding right away,
[05:49.700 --> 05:52.420]  it's because I've got about 14,000 unread emails.
[05:52.420 --> 05:53.420]  I'm trying.
[05:53.420 --> 05:56.740]  But iReed Genetics Premium Seeds is all me.
[05:56.740 --> 05:57.740]  I make seeds.
[05:57.740 --> 06:02.260]  I make regular and feminized ganja seeds for the legal market so they can produce high
[06:02.260 --> 06:07.100]  quality medicine and recreational cannabis for themselves and their clientele in a legal
[06:07.100 --> 06:08.100]  fashion.
[06:08.100 --> 06:11.100]  That's what I do.
[06:11.100 --> 06:15.740]  Unfortunately we lost a breeder who taught me a lot and inspired me a lot.
[06:15.740 --> 06:17.300]  That man was known by Subcool.
[06:17.300 --> 06:20.560]  A lot of you that are listening know who Subcool was.
[06:20.560 --> 06:25.500]  If you didn't know who Subcool was already, I invite you to just press pause on my show,
[06:25.500 --> 06:30.820]  Google Subcool, Google the Weed Nerd, watch some Weed Nerd shows, fall in love with Subbies,
[06:30.820 --> 06:31.820]  fall in love with Sub.
[06:31.820 --> 06:32.820]  That was hard to say.
[06:32.820 --> 06:34.740]  I meant it, but it was hard to say.
[06:34.740 --> 06:36.640]  Fall in love with Subbie just like we all did.
[06:36.640 --> 06:37.640]  Learn from Sub.
[06:37.640 --> 06:41.260]  A lot of my teachings, a lot of my learning, a lot of my education, a lot of my delivery
[06:41.260 --> 06:43.200]  and style came from Sub.
[06:43.200 --> 06:48.280]  I like to say I learned a lot of what to do and also a lot of what not to do in the cannabis
[06:48.280 --> 06:50.520]  industry from my friend Subcool.
[06:50.520 --> 06:54.160]  Dude wasn't perfect, wasn't an angel, but he was a bad motherfucker and he was my friend.
[06:54.160 --> 06:55.320]  He taught me a lot.
[06:55.320 --> 06:56.640]  So Subcool passed away.
[06:56.640 --> 06:57.640]  Rest in peace Subbie.
[06:57.640 --> 06:58.640]  I miss you.
[06:58.640 --> 06:59.640]  I love you.
[06:59.640 --> 07:00.640]  The whole iReed Army misses you.
[07:00.640 --> 07:01.640]  We all love you.
[07:01.640 --> 07:02.640]  I wish you were still here.
[07:02.640 --> 07:03.640]  He's not.
[07:03.640 --> 07:07.080]  So in honor of what I did, I got a pack of seeds that were bred by Subcool and I found
[07:07.080 --> 07:09.040]  a male out of that package of seeds.
[07:09.040 --> 07:11.280]  I found a Jack the Ripper male that was beautiful.
[07:11.280 --> 07:13.160]  He had a beautiful structure.
[07:13.160 --> 07:14.660]  He was a stud.
[07:14.660 --> 07:15.660]  He was a ripper.
[07:15.660 --> 07:17.600]  He had a nice aroma, a nice structure.
[07:17.600 --> 07:19.480]  He flowered well.
[07:19.480 --> 07:20.560]  He had the right shape to him.
[07:20.560 --> 07:21.600]  It was what I was looking for.
[07:21.600 --> 07:23.400]  The male plant had trichomes.
[07:23.400 --> 07:26.400]  I've posted so many photos of this male Jack the Ripper plant.
[07:26.400 --> 07:30.640]  The whole project was posted on my Instagram on iReed underscore genetics.
[07:30.640 --> 07:33.080]  Anyway, I found this Jack the Ripper male.
[07:33.080 --> 07:37.600]  I crossed it to my prized blueberry cookies female.
[07:37.600 --> 07:42.160]  I got that blueberry cookies female from a commercial grow several years ago and I've
[07:42.160 --> 07:45.320]  been crossing it to a lot of things and it is an amazing plant.
[07:45.320 --> 07:46.840]  It does a lot of great breeding.
[07:46.840 --> 07:51.280]  I'm actually Googling Jack the Ripper right now because I didn't write down the genetics
[07:51.280 --> 07:53.040]  and it's got a lot of different things in it.
[07:53.040 --> 07:56.400]  When I get to that point, I'm going to want to be able to give you the exact details on
[07:56.400 --> 07:57.400]  that.
[07:57.400 --> 07:58.540]  So I took the Jack the Ripper male.
[07:58.540 --> 08:02.640]  This is the part where I want to read you the details of what Jack the Ripper is and
[08:03.200 --> 08:06.920]  instead of finding the male, it brought up the serial killer of course.
[08:06.920 --> 08:10.200]  So I'm going to type in strain instead of cross because it's going to be a lot more
[08:10.200 --> 08:11.200]  info.
[08:11.200 --> 08:12.200]  Anyway, it's going to get us there.
[08:12.200 --> 08:15.360]  It is a cross of...
[08:15.360 --> 08:18.240]  I'm trying to just go quickly on this show here.
[08:18.240 --> 08:20.320]  Of course, it wants to know if I'm 21 or older.
[08:20.320 --> 08:23.160]  I used to go to Subcool's website and that link is now...
[08:23.160 --> 08:24.440]  It's a dead link now.
[08:24.440 --> 08:27.200]  He's probably not paying the bill since he's passed away.
[08:27.200 --> 08:28.680]  Jack the Ripper or JTO.
[08:28.680 --> 08:33.840]  JTR is the flagship hybrid from Subcool the Dank and it was created to make his famous
[08:33.840 --> 08:36.600]  Jack's cleaner in seed form.
[08:36.600 --> 08:39.280]  It's known as the fastest lemon haze available.
[08:39.280 --> 08:40.680]  I just want to know the genetics.
[08:40.680 --> 08:45.600]  It is Space Dude and Jack the... and Jack Herrer, but I wanted a better breakdown of
[08:45.600 --> 08:46.600]  it.
[08:46.600 --> 08:47.600]  Now I feel very unprofessional.
[08:47.600 --> 08:49.600]  I'm probably not even going to edit this.
[08:49.600 --> 08:50.600]  I used to go to Sub's site.
[08:50.600 --> 08:52.440]  You guys, that site is gone now.
[08:52.440 --> 08:56.520]  Jack the Ripper seeds.
[08:56.520 --> 08:58.160]  Now let's do strain details.
[08:58.160 --> 08:59.160]  That's better.
[08:59.160 --> 09:04.840]  It's probably going to take me to like Seed Finder or something, but I don't want to use
[09:04.840 --> 09:05.840]  Leafly.
[09:05.840 --> 09:06.840]  That's whack.
[09:06.840 --> 09:08.880]  All right.
[09:08.880 --> 09:10.200]  You may have noticed a quick edit there.
[09:10.200 --> 09:11.560]  You may not have noticed anything.
[09:11.560 --> 09:12.920]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[09:12.920 --> 09:15.560]  Let's talk about Jack the Ripper, the male that I chose.
[09:15.560 --> 09:19.320]  Jack the Ripper is a cross of Jack's cleaner and Space Queen.
[09:19.320 --> 09:22.760]  Space Queen is Subcool's prized male.
[09:22.760 --> 09:26.120]  Space Dude was the prized male, sort of like my King Solomon.
[09:26.120 --> 09:28.160]  That is what I cross everything to.
[09:28.160 --> 09:31.040]  Space Dude is what Subcool crossed everything to.
[09:31.040 --> 09:35.720]  We've got a Jack's cleaner to Space Queen or the Space Dude male.
[09:35.720 --> 09:37.000]  Let's talk about Jack's cleaner.
[09:37.000 --> 09:44.120]  That was Pluton and Lamb's Bread and Purple Haze and Northern Lights crossed to Jack Herrer.
[09:44.120 --> 09:45.280]  We've got the Pluton.
[09:45.280 --> 09:46.680]  I'm not sure what Pluton is.
[09:46.680 --> 09:49.840]  That's an unknown strain, but we've got Lamb's Bread in there.
[09:49.840 --> 09:52.800]  Definitely a classic, one of my favorites, a Jamaican favorite.
[09:52.800 --> 09:54.080]  We got Purple Haze in there.
[09:54.080 --> 09:56.360]  It doesn't get any more classic than Purple Haze.
[09:56.360 --> 09:57.920]  We got Northern Lights in there.
[09:57.920 --> 09:59.400]  That is an old school one.
[09:59.400 --> 10:01.000]  Then that is crossed to the Jack Herrer.
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.200]  We got a lot of great lineage in the Jack's cleaner.
[10:04.200 --> 10:05.720]  That is crossed to the Space Queen.
[10:05.720 --> 10:07.760]  Let's see if there's a breakdown for the Space Queen.
[10:07.760 --> 10:11.520]  That is Romulan and Cindy 99.
[10:11.520 --> 10:12.960]  That is a lot of great stuff going in there.
[10:12.960 --> 10:15.960]  We got the Romulan, also in the Golden Goat.
[10:15.960 --> 10:20.900]  That is a short, squatty, faster flowering, kind of a sativa dominant plant that flowers
[10:20.980 --> 10:22.460]  quite quickly.
[10:22.460 --> 10:24.700]  Crossed to the Cindy 99.
[10:24.700 --> 10:27.220]  Big shout out to our friends Brothers Graham.
[10:27.220 --> 10:30.420]  Big shout out to Mr. Soul for the Cindy 99.
[10:30.420 --> 10:35.860]  That's got Princess and P94, which is Jack Herrer to a mystery male.
[10:35.860 --> 10:38.820]  We've got Jack Herrer on two different ends of this.
[10:38.820 --> 10:44.700]  It was sort of Sub's kind of an idea to make his version of Jack Herrer or a Jack's cleaner
[10:44.700 --> 10:46.060]  seed form.
[10:46.060 --> 10:47.500]  We've got Jack the Ripper.
[10:47.500 --> 10:50.980]  The reason I wanted to breed the two Jack the Ripper is I really love ... I've smoked
[10:50.980 --> 10:52.060]  a lot of Jack the Ripper.
[10:52.060 --> 10:55.820]  It represents Sub Cool very well.
[10:55.820 --> 11:00.140]  It's not using his Space Queen or his Space Dude, which would have been too obvious to
[11:00.140 --> 11:03.220]  make a Sub Cool tribute cross.
[11:03.220 --> 11:06.700]  I made a Jack the Ripper cross because it's one of his flagship strains.
[11:06.700 --> 11:10.260]  I love the flavors and aromas that come from that strain.
[11:10.260 --> 11:15.020]  It's got these ... The phenotypes that I found, I found a key lime pie phenotype that was
[11:15.020 --> 11:16.020]  just delicious.
[11:16.020 --> 11:22.260]  Lots of lemon, lemon cleaner, like lemon pledges, bathroom cleaner, and lemons.
[11:22.260 --> 11:25.220]  Lots of just crazy lemon candy and cleaner flavors.
[11:25.220 --> 11:28.820]  I like the Jack the Ripper for the buzz, the flavor, the aromas, and the growth.
[11:28.820 --> 11:34.900]  It's got a really sativa, like head-ringing buzz, but it doesn't take a super long time
[11:34.900 --> 11:35.900]  to flower.
[11:35.900 --> 11:37.820]  You could get it done in 63 days.
[11:37.820 --> 11:42.500]  Some strains that give you that potency, that buzz, take closer to 70, 72 days.
[11:42.500 --> 11:45.940]  It'd come down a week early and you'd still get wrecked from it, which I really like.
[11:45.980 --> 11:52.740]  I like that panic attack, heart racing, fucking lose your keys when they're in your hand,
[11:52.740 --> 11:55.620]  can't find your cell phone when it's ringing in your pocket sort of stuff.
[11:55.620 --> 11:57.860]  I love that kind of herb.
[11:57.860 --> 12:03.780]  Waiting for the stop sign to turn green is one of my favorite kind of herbs.
[12:03.780 --> 12:05.660]  If you got that kind of weed, that's the best.
[12:05.660 --> 12:09.900]  The kind of weed you got to turn down the radio so that you can see the street signs
[12:09.900 --> 12:12.140]  better, that's this kind of herb.
[12:12.140 --> 12:13.860]  That is Jack the Ripper.
[12:13.900 --> 12:17.140]  That is the male that I selected from the sub-cool side of this cross.
[12:17.140 --> 12:18.340]  Now let's talk about the female.
[12:18.340 --> 12:20.780]  We got to talk about the female I chose to breed with.
[12:20.780 --> 12:24.220]  The female in this cross was the Blueberry Cookies.
[12:24.220 --> 12:31.620]  That is blueberry crossed to Tahoe OG, then crossed to the Thin Mint Cookies.
[12:31.620 --> 12:32.780]  That's one of my favorite crosses.
[12:32.780 --> 12:34.680]  I've made the Leonardo.
[12:34.680 --> 12:35.680]  That is Leonardo.
[12:35.680 --> 12:37.180]  That is what Leonardo is.
[12:37.180 --> 12:42.740]  Then from there, we've got six other out-crosses of Leonardo to make the TMNT line.
[12:42.740 --> 12:45.620]  I reversed it to make that full feminized line.
[12:45.620 --> 12:48.180]  It is also the Blue Raspberry Truffle.
[12:48.180 --> 12:52.660]  That is a rise crossed to the Blueberry Cookies.
[12:52.660 --> 12:55.100]  Sorry, my brain went totally numb for a minute there.
[12:55.100 --> 12:58.660]  The arise pollinating the Blueberry Cookies makes the Blue Raspberry Truffle.
[12:58.660 --> 13:03.260]  I was also thinking about the Blue Pill is the Blueberry Cookies to the reversed Golden
[13:03.260 --> 13:04.260]  Goat.
[13:04.260 --> 13:06.740]  I've made a lot of things with this Blueberry Cookies.
[13:06.740 --> 13:07.740]  It's one of my favorites.
[13:07.740 --> 13:09.380]  It kicks ass.
[13:09.380 --> 13:13.060]  Now we have got the Blueberry Cookies crossed to Jack the Ripper.
[13:13.060 --> 13:16.740]  I don't think I've even said the name of it yet, which is I'm doing that on purpose.
[13:16.740 --> 13:20.580]  I'm trying to build a little bit of suspense to the best of my recum election.
[13:20.580 --> 13:21.900]  I have not said the name.
[13:21.900 --> 13:23.020]  We've talked about the parents.
[13:23.020 --> 13:27.260]  We've talked about the Jack the Ripper, why I selected that Jack the Ripper.
[13:27.260 --> 13:30.540]  First reason was to tribute subcool.
[13:30.540 --> 13:34.620]  Second reason was flavor, aroma, structure, flowering time, and potency.
[13:34.620 --> 13:38.380]  All of those things are amazing with Jack the Ripper, very good breeding candidate.
[13:38.380 --> 13:41.500]  Then I've got the Blueberry Cookies.
[13:41.500 --> 13:42.940]  Why do I breed to that?
[13:42.940 --> 13:43.980]  It is pungent.
[13:43.980 --> 13:44.980]  It is potent.
[13:44.980 --> 13:45.980]  It is vigorous.
[13:45.980 --> 13:48.900]  You can beat the shit out of that plant and it will recover.
[13:48.900 --> 13:52.960]  You could pee on it, light it on fire, and kick it over and leave.
[13:52.960 --> 13:56.140]  And then tomorrow when you come back, that plant will be standing up stronger than it
[13:56.140 --> 13:58.020]  ever was going, that was a good try.
[13:58.020 --> 14:00.080]  I don't know what you thought you were going to do to me.
[14:00.080 --> 14:01.220]  That plant is a boss.
[14:01.220 --> 14:02.340]  It's a savage.
[14:02.340 --> 14:04.660]  It grows amazingly well in all conditions.
[14:04.660 --> 14:05.880]  It tastes good.
[14:05.880 --> 14:07.620]  It is potent as shit.
[14:07.860 --> 14:10.900]  It harvests very well and it breeds very, very well.
[14:10.900 --> 14:11.900]  It's a very good breeder.
[14:11.900 --> 14:16.500]  It brings a lot to the table in breeding, but it also allows a lot to be added to it
[14:16.500 --> 14:17.500]  in breeding.
[14:17.500 --> 14:18.500]  It's a good ingredient.
[14:18.500 --> 14:20.700]  It's not just a dominant flavor in the breeding.
[14:20.700 --> 14:22.540]  It lets things open up to it.
[14:22.540 --> 14:27.660]  So that's the Blueberry Cookies, the Blueberry to Tahoe to the Cookies.
[14:27.660 --> 14:31.860]  We got the Jack the Ripper, which has got the Lamb's Bread, the AK-47, the Northern
[14:31.860 --> 14:32.860]  Lights.
[14:32.860 --> 14:34.620]  Sorry, I mix AK and Northern Lights in my head all the time.
[14:34.620 --> 14:37.660]  There's a reason for that we'll talk about in the future.
[14:37.660 --> 14:41.420]  So we got a whole hodgepodge of genetics going on in that one.
[14:41.420 --> 14:45.220]  Then do I want to tell you the name of it or do I want to talk why I selected them?
[14:45.220 --> 14:48.900]  That Blueberry Cookies is a champ and I knew they would breed well together.
[14:48.900 --> 14:52.000]  Something about when I see two plants, I just go, ooh, you.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.260]  It's like just hanging out with friends, hanging out with two people.
[14:55.260 --> 14:59.300]  Now I used to say hanging out with a guy and you know a girl, but it's 2021.
[14:59.300 --> 15:03.820]  You're hanging out with a person and you go, hey, you know, Bill, you may really like Steve
[15:04.020 --> 15:05.300]  or you may really like Emily.
[15:05.300 --> 15:08.740]  I don't know which fucking one, but hypothetically you may like one of them and you just know
[15:08.740 --> 15:12.980]  it and you hook Bill up with Steve or Emily and they got a fucking completely happy future
[15:12.980 --> 15:15.060]  just because you could see it.
[15:15.060 --> 15:18.100]  In my analogy, it's got to be Bill and Emily because they're going to breed.
[15:18.100 --> 15:19.540]  Sorry, Steve.
[15:19.540 --> 15:22.460]  But Bill and Emily are going to breed and they make beautiful children and then you
[15:22.460 --> 15:24.940]  go, ha ha, I got to, I got to predict that that happened.
[15:24.940 --> 15:26.860]  So my plants, I could just see it sometimes.
[15:26.860 --> 15:30.940]  I know that if I pollinate that girl with that male, the offspring is going to be fucking
[15:30.940 --> 15:31.940]  stellar.
[15:31.940 --> 15:33.060]  Sometimes I just know that.
[15:33.060 --> 15:38.260]  So I took the Jack the Ripper male, I took the blueberry cookies, female, don't worry.
[15:38.260 --> 15:41.660]  I also pollinated a bunch of other females when I did this.
[15:41.660 --> 15:45.740]  So there'll be other females released with other cool names.
[15:45.740 --> 15:47.220]  We'll talk about that in a future episode.
[15:47.220 --> 15:49.700]  I made a Jack the Ripper F2s.
[15:49.700 --> 15:50.980]  That was a really fun project.
[15:50.980 --> 15:51.980]  So I did the pollination.
[15:51.980 --> 15:53.660]  We made the project.
[15:53.660 --> 15:57.220]  I've talked about why I've talked about the selections, talked about the parents, talked
[15:57.220 --> 15:59.300]  about blueberry cookies, talked about JTR.
[15:59.300 --> 16:01.900]  Now what does this cross make?
[16:01.900 --> 16:09.620]  This cross makes crazy pungent, crazy potent sativa dominant hybrids that smell and taste.
[16:09.620 --> 16:11.440]  Are you ready for these flavor descriptions?
[16:11.440 --> 16:12.740]  These came from my testers.
[16:12.740 --> 16:15.020]  You guys, I didn't make these up.
[16:15.020 --> 16:25.420]  Blueberry syrup, blueberry fun dip, fake blue candy flavors, lemon berries, weird sour stuff.
[16:25.420 --> 16:29.660]  And then I thought one smelled like Red Bull and somebody else told me they smelled like
[16:29.660 --> 16:32.100]  purple Flintstone vitamins.
[16:32.100 --> 16:36.060]  I think the Red Bull and Flintstone vitamins may be the same aroma.
[16:36.060 --> 16:37.060]  Somebody else said it was vitamins.
[16:37.060 --> 16:38.540]  I thought it was Red Bull.
[16:38.540 --> 16:44.720]  We're getting blueberry, blueberry syrup, blueberry fun dip, fake blue candy flavors,
[16:44.720 --> 16:47.580]  and then we got lemon berries, weird sour stuff.
[16:47.580 --> 16:50.500]  That's a really good description because it's weird sour stuff.
[16:50.500 --> 16:52.260]  I say it's got a wang to it.
[16:52.260 --> 16:54.420]  You smell it and you're like, that's just kind of wang.
[16:54.420 --> 16:55.420]  It's got a wang to it.
[16:55.420 --> 16:57.220]  It's deliciously wangy.
[16:57.220 --> 17:00.020]  It's got a really nice flavor.
[17:00.020 --> 17:05.580]  Sour stuff, Red Bull, vitamins, and then a lot of people said lemon cleaner.
[17:05.580 --> 17:07.180]  Smells like chemicals and cleaner.
[17:07.180 --> 17:10.460]  So there are a lot of wonderful, marvelous aromas coming from this.
[17:10.460 --> 17:14.140]  Some of them almost kind of burn your eyes in a good, good way.
[17:14.140 --> 17:16.300]  The concentrates didn't get to smoke a lot.
[17:16.300 --> 17:17.700]  They went really quickly.
[17:17.700 --> 17:20.900]  The concentrates were almost lemon spicy.
[17:20.900 --> 17:25.420]  It was almost so much lemons that it like hit your nose and cleaned your sinuses.
[17:25.420 --> 17:27.100]  You could almost feel it.
[17:27.100 --> 17:28.300]  I heated up the dab nail.
[17:28.300 --> 17:29.620]  I could almost feel it.
[17:29.620 --> 17:34.020]  It was like a saucy, diamondy consistency.
[17:34.020 --> 17:39.460]  When I would put it into the banger, I could almost taste it and feel the effervescence
[17:39.460 --> 17:45.180]  hitting my lungs and nose before the dab even felt like it vaporized or volatized or whatever
[17:45.180 --> 17:46.500]  it did in my banger.
[17:46.500 --> 17:51.580]  Before I saw smoke or vapor in the rig, I could feel those turps hitting me.
[17:51.580 --> 17:54.820]  It was like spicy, lemony.
[17:54.820 --> 17:59.500]  If you've ever cleaned anything with orange cleaner, it was like using lemon cleaner.
[17:59.500 --> 18:03.940]  It was very turpy, very turpidelic with a little bit of a spiciness to it.
[18:03.940 --> 18:06.460]  I'm fucking rambly, so this could be a long, fun episode.
[18:06.460 --> 18:08.140]  I'm really having a good time behind the mic today.
[18:08.140 --> 18:11.140]  I've needed to get behind the mic for a minute and let loose.
[18:11.140 --> 18:12.740]  Let's talk about the buzz.
[18:12.740 --> 18:16.420]  A lot of people said the buzz was very social.
[18:16.420 --> 18:19.760]  Some people said they wish they would let it go longer because they cut it too early
[18:19.760 --> 18:23.500]  and they got a really high, racy head buzz.
[18:23.500 --> 18:28.820]  I got the word talkative and chatty from a lot of people who tested this.
[18:28.820 --> 18:30.300]  When you smoke this, you turn into me.
[18:30.300 --> 18:34.380]  You just start fucking talking, just talkative and chatty.
[18:34.380 --> 18:36.180]  But sometimes you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
[18:36.180 --> 18:37.460]  It'll just talk you into circles.
[18:37.460 --> 18:39.620]  You'll talk yourself into space.
[18:39.620 --> 18:43.340]  It's mind moving is something I wrote.
[18:43.340 --> 18:47.340]  Something about those Jack the Ripper, Jack Herrer turps in there mixed with the Girl
[18:47.340 --> 18:51.860]  Scout Cookies turps in there, something just moves your brain.
[18:52.020 --> 18:53.980]  It can give you a little bit of panic.
[18:53.980 --> 18:56.660]  Some people reported it was too much, too heavy.
[18:56.660 --> 19:00.260]  They said when they cut it down too early, they were a little bit panicky, a little bit
[19:00.260 --> 19:04.780]  racy and a little bit bug-eyed and they wish they'd let it go a little bit longer.
[19:04.780 --> 19:05.780]  It'll make you talkative.
[19:05.780 --> 19:06.780]  It'll make you social.
[19:06.780 --> 19:07.940]  It'll make you chatty.
[19:07.940 --> 19:09.500]  It's mind moving.
[19:09.500 --> 19:13.980]  Sometimes it'll give you panic, but it will give you a strong, moving head buzz.
[19:13.980 --> 19:16.740]  It'll get you going really good.
[19:16.740 --> 19:18.620]  That is the consumption factors.
[19:18.900 --> 19:22.380]  I noticed it makes my eyes completely fucking red.
[19:22.380 --> 19:24.580]  I don't know if it did that to anybody else.
[19:24.580 --> 19:25.660]  Cannabis doesn't make my eyes red.
[19:25.660 --> 19:27.340]  I got to smoke hard to get red eyes.
[19:27.340 --> 19:31.060]  It's got to be like the late night session once I'm burned out and maxed out for the
[19:31.060 --> 19:32.060]  day.
[19:32.060 --> 19:35.660]  But this stuff, smoking on this strain that I haven't named yet, I'm trying to dodge the
[19:35.660 --> 19:36.660]  name.
[19:36.660 --> 19:38.100]  I'm going to give you the name just to be fun here pretty soon.
[19:38.100 --> 19:41.180]  But this stuff did make my eyes completely super red.
[19:41.180 --> 19:42.180]  We got flavors.
[19:42.180 --> 19:43.220]  We got aromas.
[19:43.220 --> 19:44.220]  We got the buzz.
[19:44.220 --> 19:47.500]  Now, let's talk about some of the most important factors to a lot of you.
[19:47.500 --> 19:49.020]  This is growing this cannabis.
[19:49.020 --> 19:51.240]  How is this going to work for you?
[19:51.240 --> 19:56.420]  One thing I want to talk about is these were some of the healthiest, most healthy seeds
[19:56.420 --> 19:58.140]  I have ever produced.
[19:58.140 --> 20:01.280]  I've been making seeds for a long time.
[20:01.280 --> 20:04.420]  Sometimes some plants just make ugly seeds.
[20:04.420 --> 20:06.980]  Sometimes some plants make beautiful seeds.
[20:06.980 --> 20:10.580]  Almost every seed that came out of this run was beautiful.
[20:10.580 --> 20:11.580]  What was the difference?
[20:11.580 --> 20:15.700]  The new addition, the new anomaly, the new change up?
[20:15.860 --> 20:17.740]  Canon LEDs from Black Sale Market.
[20:17.740 --> 20:21.780]  Big shout out to my buddy Keith at Black Sale Market.
[20:21.780 --> 20:26.820]  Those Canon LEDs made my seeds beautiful, bigger, fatter, robust.
[20:26.820 --> 20:30.580]  It could have been that male, but man, those seeds were beautiful.
[20:30.580 --> 20:31.580]  I think it was the light.
[20:31.580 --> 20:34.860]  I think it was the light because every seed, sometimes you get some shitty seeds in the
[20:34.860 --> 20:36.060]  mix.
[20:36.060 --> 20:37.620]  The seeds on the bottom of the plant don't look good.
[20:37.620 --> 20:38.900]  You get some white dead seeds.
[20:38.900 --> 20:40.500]  I didn't get any of those.
[20:40.500 --> 20:43.020]  All of the seeds were fucking awesome.
[20:43.060 --> 20:46.540]  Some of the biggest, baddest, healthiest, most beautiful seeds I've ever bred.
[20:46.540 --> 20:48.740]  They were done under LEDs.
[20:48.740 --> 20:54.380]  I got a lot of reports of really good female to male ratios.
[20:54.380 --> 20:56.540]  A lot of these plants are popping up female.
[20:56.540 --> 20:58.780]  That is really awesome for you guys out there.
[20:58.780 --> 21:02.460]  I can't make any guarantees, but the reports, a lot of females.
[21:02.460 --> 21:10.200]  Also, a lot of very good germination rates, 90 to 100% germination rates from almost everybody
[21:10.200 --> 21:11.800]  I sent seeds to.
[21:11.800 --> 21:15.920]  The people that said they didn't get good germs, they said themselves, I fucked something
[21:15.920 --> 21:16.920]  up.
[21:16.920 --> 21:22.880]  I'm going to say we got more than 90% germination, which is that qualifies in my book.
[21:22.880 --> 21:25.560]  These plants veg very vigorously.
[21:25.560 --> 21:28.080]  They don't veg like something that would be crossed with a rise.
[21:28.080 --> 21:33.300]  They don't have that hyper vigor, but they veg quickly and they veg very strongly.
[21:33.300 --> 21:35.480]  These plants are strong.
[21:35.480 --> 21:36.480]  Where are we going?
[21:36.480 --> 21:37.560]  I lost my place in my notes.
[21:37.560 --> 21:39.320]  There we go.
[21:39.320 --> 21:43.400]  They make that classic Christmas tree, kind of a menorah shape.
[21:43.400 --> 21:47.080]  They grow branchy bottom and they grow at the top, goes real tall.
[21:47.080 --> 21:49.160]  The other branches try to catch up to that.
[21:49.160 --> 21:53.480]  We're going to talk more about how to deal with that in a minute here.
[21:53.480 --> 21:58.840]  In veg, there's nothing super indicative of which phenotype you've got other than leaf
[21:58.840 --> 21:59.840]  size.
[21:59.840 --> 22:03.880]  We'll talk more specifically about phenotypes later in the episode, but you're not going
[22:03.880 --> 22:09.840]  to be able to tell which phenotype you've got early in veg unless you've got huge maple
[22:09.840 --> 22:13.200]  leaf size leaves.
[22:13.200 --> 22:15.320]  Those are the platinum cookies heavy phenotypes.
[22:15.320 --> 22:19.560]  If you've got the super thin leaf, that's jack, anything in the middle there, or it
[22:19.560 --> 22:22.520]  could be kind of lambs bready, jack lambs bread leaning.
[22:22.520 --> 22:24.560]  I'm not super experienced with the lambs bread.
[22:24.560 --> 22:29.320]  I can't tell you enough details to know if that's what I'm seeing, but most of them are
[22:29.320 --> 22:31.240]  going to lie anywhere in between there.
[22:31.240 --> 22:35.080]  You're going to get big fat leaves or real skinny leaves or anywhere in between because
[22:35.080 --> 22:38.200]  this is a crazy hybrid with a lot of different genetics.
[22:38.200 --> 22:41.960]  You're going to see big mashups of different things.
[22:41.960 --> 22:46.720]  Most of the plants will make one big dominant top and a nice bushy bottom.
[22:46.720 --> 22:49.680]  I know bushy bottom is going to get a lot of people's attention.
[22:49.680 --> 22:51.520]  We all like them big bottom girls.
[22:51.520 --> 22:54.760]  It does get that big fat bottom, but it's going to grow one main top and it's going
[22:54.760 --> 22:57.880]  to keep growing that Christmas tree, menorah sort of shape.
[22:57.880 --> 22:59.160]  I generally top it.
[22:59.160 --> 23:00.840]  We're going to talk more about that.
[23:00.840 --> 23:05.680]  I call it making, it makes a menorah or a Christmas tree with what I call the leader,
[23:05.680 --> 23:07.200]  one ambitious fucking leader.
[23:07.200 --> 23:10.720]  You got to knock that leader out in my opinion, most of the time.
[23:10.720 --> 23:13.000]  I suggest topping these plants.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.640]  I keep saying it's going to make that one leader top.
[23:15.640 --> 23:19.960]  You got all the bottoms coming up, cut out that main top and then it creates a nice,
[23:19.960 --> 23:22.040]  like a shrub, like just a nice bush.
[23:22.040 --> 23:26.800]  If you put it in a big pot, these plants will spread out really nicely.
[23:27.800 --> 23:32.680]  When you put these plants into flower, they will transition into bloom very quickly is
[23:32.680 --> 23:33.760]  something I've noticed.
[23:33.760 --> 23:39.960]  That could be because I'm growing under LEDs and when I switch from 18-6 to 11-13, they
[23:39.960 --> 23:44.240]  trigger into flower super quickly, but it is something I observed.
[23:44.240 --> 23:47.880]  These plants went more quickly than other plants in the same room.
[23:47.880 --> 23:49.540]  They triggered quickly into flower.
[23:49.540 --> 23:53.560]  They transfer, transition quickly into the bloom phase.
[23:53.560 --> 23:57.200]  These plants love being tied down.
[23:57.200 --> 23:58.200]  They're weird girls.
[23:58.200 --> 24:01.160]  They want to be twisted, popped and tortured and held down.
[24:01.160 --> 24:03.080]  You can do that to these girls.
[24:03.080 --> 24:04.480]  Pop them, twist them.
[24:04.480 --> 24:06.740]  Be careful, but you can do that.
[24:06.740 --> 24:10.360]  They like to be tied down, trellis down and netted down.
[24:10.360 --> 24:14.120]  You can do that into like week three or four of flower.
[24:14.120 --> 24:15.880]  They get soft and vine-like.
[24:15.880 --> 24:21.040]  These plants will grow with like, some plants are known to get woody and hard and they don't
[24:21.040 --> 24:24.360]  bend and pop and twist as easily as these plants will.
[24:24.360 --> 24:28.720]  These plants get like a sappy wire structure.
[24:28.720 --> 24:31.160]  You can bend them and wrap them around a vine.
[24:31.160 --> 24:33.700]  They are very, very twisty and viney.
[24:33.700 --> 24:38.240]  They pop and twist them very carefully because of that viney structure.
[24:38.240 --> 24:40.120]  Sometimes you'll just blow up that whole stem.
[24:40.120 --> 24:44.040]  You'll go to twist it, it'll just rip off or you'll just explode the whole thing, but
[24:44.040 --> 24:45.040]  they're soft.
[24:45.040 --> 24:48.600]  They're very soft if you take care of them and stay nice and healthy.
[24:48.600 --> 24:52.680]  They'll be soft and supple and pliable and bright, bright green.
[24:52.680 --> 24:54.040]  Tie them down, twist them.
[24:54.040 --> 24:57.980]  They will need some supports because they're so twisty, so pliable.
[24:57.980 --> 25:02.000]  Some of those longer branches, especially your bottom branches are going to get droopy
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.060]  and floppy.
[25:03.060 --> 25:07.600]  Give them some love, give them some support, some plant Viagra if you will.
[25:07.600 --> 25:12.720]  Now I keep saying that these plants will stay soft and really light green and very supple
[25:12.720 --> 25:14.320]  and very pliable.
[25:14.320 --> 25:16.100]  That is if we properly feed them.
[25:16.100 --> 25:18.660]  These plants will get a little bit picky about the nutrients.
[25:18.660 --> 25:23.940]  You can't overfeed them, but they like a lot of nitrogen and veg and you got to drop that
[25:23.940 --> 25:27.700]  shit out almost immediately as you transition into flower.
[25:27.700 --> 25:31.500]  Pay attention to these plants because they're picky with nutrients.
[25:31.500 --> 25:35.620]  If you overfeed them when they go into flower, they don't make big buds.
[25:35.620 --> 25:40.100]  They just make little sparse buds and they make a lot of branching and a lot of leaves.
[25:40.100 --> 25:45.020]  If your leaves are not doing the normal leaf shape thing you expect, if they're starting
[25:45.020 --> 25:48.620]  to kind of mutate a little bit, they're getting too much nitrogen.
[25:48.620 --> 25:54.460]  In my experience, that could be one very quick indicator of too much nitrogen.
[25:54.460 --> 25:57.340]  They'll take the feedings, they'll take a little bit of heat.
[25:57.340 --> 26:01.900]  They're going to get super frosty and they're going to make what I call taco leaves or what
[26:01.900 --> 26:04.380]  also is known as a resin rail.
[26:04.380 --> 26:10.180]  The leaves that come out of the main buds are going to get resin on them very quickly.
[26:10.180 --> 26:14.020]  When it gets warm in the grow room or a little bit humid in the grow room, they will canoe
[26:14.020 --> 26:16.420]  or taco on you.
[26:16.420 --> 26:19.700]  I don't think that is from the room being too hot.
[26:19.700 --> 26:22.780]  I think that is just a trait from the Jack the Ripper.
[26:22.780 --> 26:25.220]  That is something I saw the Jack the Ripper do.
[26:25.220 --> 26:27.620]  Some of the phenotypes from JTR did that.
[26:27.620 --> 26:29.260]  Some of the offspring are doing that.
[26:29.260 --> 26:31.740]  I don't think there's a problem in the room.
[26:31.740 --> 26:33.220]  I don't think you're fucking up.
[26:33.220 --> 26:37.620]  I think that it just wants to taco up and make room for resin because the trichomes
[26:37.620 --> 26:39.820]  pop up out of the top of that taco.
[26:39.820 --> 26:41.740]  I don't think it's your fault.
[26:41.740 --> 26:46.060]  If you're not overfeeding it, if your pH isn't fucked up and if it's not too hot or
[26:46.060 --> 26:50.860]  too humid or too dry in the room, you're getting a little bit of just leaf tacoing, a little
[26:50.860 --> 26:53.740]  bit of leaf canoeing with trichomes on top.
[26:53.740 --> 26:54.740]  Don't panic.
[26:54.740 --> 26:57.900]  That is what this plant does.
[26:57.900 --> 27:00.720]  Another thing, this plant does not tolerate cold.
[27:00.720 --> 27:02.780]  If you get them cold, they'll go yellow.
[27:02.780 --> 27:03.780]  They'll stop eating.
[27:03.780 --> 27:06.500]  They'll get pissed off at you.
[27:06.500 --> 27:08.740]  Another thing, don't over defoliate.
[27:08.740 --> 27:11.300]  I talk about leafing the plants that I breed.
[27:11.860 --> 27:12.940]  Don't do that to this plant.
[27:12.940 --> 27:16.660]  The Girl Scout Cookies doesn't like being defoliated heavily.
[27:16.660 --> 27:19.460]  The Jack Harer is not a fan of super defoliation.
[27:19.460 --> 27:20.460]  Guess what?
[27:20.460 --> 27:25.140]  The Blueberry Cookies, Jack the Ripper Cross does not like to be defoliated heavily.
[27:25.140 --> 27:27.420]  Moderate defoliation at best.
[27:27.420 --> 27:28.700]  Don't go super hard.
[27:28.700 --> 27:29.760]  It likes the leaves.
[27:29.760 --> 27:33.900]  This plant is relying on those skinny leaves for energy, so don't piss it off and take
[27:33.900 --> 27:35.460]  too many off.
[27:35.460 --> 27:39.620]  Over defoliating, getting it cold, overfeeding it.
[27:39.620 --> 27:43.900]  Some of the things we think would boost up some plants, those things are what piss off
[27:43.900 --> 27:44.900]  this plant.
[27:44.900 --> 27:47.220]  This is a little bit more of a challenging plant.
[27:47.220 --> 27:51.580]  You can't be that new guy that tries to give it more shit and do more to it to make it
[27:51.580 --> 27:52.580]  speed up.
[27:52.580 --> 27:55.100]  This is one of those plants that less will do better.
[27:55.100 --> 27:59.220]  I think this plant, it's got a lot of hodgepodge genetics, but I think this would have been
[27:59.220 --> 28:03.620]  found more like in some tropical area where people couldn't have gotten to it, and it
[28:03.620 --> 28:06.420]  would have just been fucked up and abandoned by people, and then it would have just been
[28:06.420 --> 28:10.420]  out there in nature, and it would have gone crazy tall and gotten out of control, and
[28:10.420 --> 28:11.660]  it didn't need a lot of attention.
[28:11.660 --> 28:13.100]  It didn't want you to defoliate it.
[28:13.100 --> 28:15.140]  It didn't want you to give it too much care.
[28:15.140 --> 28:19.780]  Just let it grow and give it supports, and I think it'll be okay.
[28:19.780 --> 28:21.180]  Also I think it doesn't like wind.
[28:21.180 --> 28:25.740]  A lot of the phenotypes I grew and experienced, everybody by the fan got pissed off.
[28:25.740 --> 28:27.860]  The plants back behind the fan, they were all perfect.
[28:27.860 --> 28:29.020]  They were cool.
[28:29.020 --> 28:33.220]  The Jack the Ripper crosses that were by the fan, they do not tolerate the wind very well,
[28:33.220 --> 28:35.020]  so don't give them too much wind.
[28:35.020 --> 28:37.940]  Don't blow too hard on them, and don't get them too cold.
[28:37.940 --> 28:41.060]  The cold pissed them off and made them slow down.
[28:41.060 --> 28:45.160]  Something I can say, these plants grow really well until you piss them off.
[28:45.160 --> 28:49.220]  If you stay out of their way, keep them happy, give them a solid feed, pay attention to the
[28:49.220 --> 28:54.380]  feed, high nitrogen in the beginning, taper off that nitrogen, start raising up your phosphorus
[28:54.380 --> 28:56.060]  and potassium.
[28:56.060 --> 28:58.180]  Just do it just like you should a basic plant.
[28:58.180 --> 28:59.180]  They'll work very well.
[28:59.180 --> 29:02.980]  The minute you screw something up with these plants, once they go yellow, once they go
[29:02.980 --> 29:05.180]  angry, you're fucked.
[29:05.180 --> 29:10.700]  They get yellow, they'll start crisping up, cold will do it, too much moisture will do
[29:10.700 --> 29:13.120]  it, too much nutrients will do it.
[29:13.120 --> 29:17.300]  They're really easy to grow once you get them going, but once they're angry, it is over.
[29:17.300 --> 29:22.940]  I think the haze makes it go super fast and the OG makes it super finicky.
[29:22.940 --> 29:27.220]  You cross that, it's super quick to be super finicky.
[29:27.220 --> 29:29.380]  As soon as something goes wrong, it lets you know.
[29:29.380 --> 29:31.640]  So if you're growing in hydro, keep an eye on it.
[29:31.640 --> 29:36.040]  If you're a soil or soilless mix person, you may have some time to rebound or recover,
[29:36.040 --> 29:39.480]  but it's going to let you know when it's got problems.
[29:39.480 --> 29:44.640]  Also stay on top of up potting and root boundness because when this one gets root bound, she'll
[29:44.640 --> 29:45.640]  stop growing.
[29:45.640 --> 29:49.200]  As soon as the roots hit the outside of that pot, it just goes, no, I'm done.
[29:49.200 --> 29:52.300]  I like to test things in cups and get them started in cups.
[29:52.300 --> 29:55.080]  These little bitches hit the edges of the cups and just stopped.
[29:55.080 --> 29:56.080]  They're like, nope.
[29:56.080 --> 29:57.080]  I thought they were mad.
[29:57.080 --> 29:58.240]  I thought they were fucking angry.
[29:58.240 --> 29:59.240]  They're just at the edge.
[29:59.240 --> 30:00.240]  I had to up pot them.
[30:00.240 --> 30:01.240]  I had to up pot them.
[30:01.240 --> 30:02.640]  Shabang, they went crazy again.
[30:02.640 --> 30:06.880]  So also a couple of them tried to flower on me once they got to root bound.
[30:06.880 --> 30:08.680]  That is something to think about.
[30:08.680 --> 30:11.180]  It likes all of the light.
[30:11.180 --> 30:15.280]  Some plants, some of the plants I had to turn down the Canon LEDs, move them right out from
[30:15.280 --> 30:17.580]  underneath there because they don't like all that light.
[30:17.580 --> 30:20.540]  Put the Jack the Ripper crosses directly under the light.
[30:20.540 --> 30:22.760]  Put the light on the Jack the Ripper crosses.
[30:22.760 --> 30:24.720]  Feed the light to these plants.
[30:24.720 --> 30:27.120]  It wants all of the fucking light.
[30:27.120 --> 30:29.000]  Did I mention that these plants want light?
[30:29.000 --> 30:30.000]  It will take it.
[30:30.000 --> 30:31.400]  It's got lamb's bread in there.
[30:31.400 --> 30:32.940]  It's got Jack Harrier in there.
[30:32.940 --> 30:34.080]  It can take some fucking light.
[30:34.080 --> 30:35.600]  Give it all the light.
[30:35.600 --> 30:36.600]  It doesn't like wind.
[30:36.600 --> 30:37.600]  I mentioned that.
[30:37.600 --> 30:39.520]  If you put them too close to the fan, they get pissy.
[30:39.520 --> 30:41.720]  If it gets too dry in there, they get pissy.
[30:41.720 --> 30:43.920]  If it gets too wet in there, guess what?
[30:43.920 --> 30:44.920]  They get pissy.
[30:44.920 --> 30:47.280]  You got to keep it just right in there.
[30:47.280 --> 30:48.880]  They're a little bit weird.
[30:48.880 --> 30:52.560]  Some of the plants in the room, I mentioned this, got fried by LEDs.
[30:52.560 --> 30:56.400]  I put some new plants in a room and with a new built room with some brand new LEDs, the
[30:56.400 --> 30:58.960]  tops of some of them roasted.
[30:58.960 --> 31:00.560]  That's what the Jack the Rippers didn't do.
[31:00.560 --> 31:01.640]  They didn't roast.
[31:01.640 --> 31:02.640]  They just took it.
[31:02.640 --> 31:06.680]  Everything crossed to the Jack the Ripper was fine with being punished by too much light.
[31:06.680 --> 31:09.920]  They were unscathed is the word I put on my notes.
[31:09.920 --> 31:14.240]  The next part to talk about, they stretch.
[31:14.240 --> 31:15.720]  These plants will stretch on you.
[31:15.720 --> 31:20.640]  The first few days of flower, they're going to take off, but, but, but, but top them,
[31:20.640 --> 31:21.640]  not in flower.
[31:21.640 --> 31:25.440]  Before you flower them, top them, pop them and twist them and that will slow down the
[31:25.440 --> 31:26.440]  stretch.
[31:26.440 --> 31:27.620]  Give them a nice feed.
[31:27.620 --> 31:32.740]  Give them a nice NPK and they will not take off too fast on you, but they do stretch.
[31:32.740 --> 31:33.740]  They get tall on you.
[31:33.740 --> 31:36.700]  I lost my place on my notes.
[31:36.700 --> 31:38.380]  Where are we?
[31:38.380 --> 31:42.900]  Oh, um, feeding, feeding the skinny leaf phenotype.
[31:42.900 --> 31:44.420]  Oh, I missed this part.
[31:44.420 --> 31:45.660]  They're super easy to clone.
[31:45.660 --> 31:50.820]  When you take that top off of that plant, clone it because they are super easy to clone.
[31:50.820 --> 31:51.820]  They love to clone.
[31:51.820 --> 31:53.220]  You could basically just set it down.
[31:53.220 --> 31:55.360]  It will make a clone feeding.
[31:55.360 --> 32:01.960]  The skinny leaf phenotype wants less food and higher pH, but don't slow down the calcium.
[32:01.960 --> 32:03.420]  I said less food.
[32:03.420 --> 32:05.320]  Don't knock out the calcium.
[32:05.320 --> 32:06.920]  So I'll repeat that.
[32:06.920 --> 32:10.780]  The skinnier leaf phenotypes want less food.
[32:10.780 --> 32:15.860]  So if you've got a real thin phenotype, thinly phenotype, it wants less food and a higher
[32:15.860 --> 32:18.840]  pH, but it also wants more calcium.
[32:18.840 --> 32:22.480]  Don't slow down the CalMag on that thinly phenotype.
[32:22.480 --> 32:25.480]  All of the phenotypes seem to love calcium later in life.
[32:25.480 --> 32:26.800]  Not when they're little, they got pissy.
[32:26.800 --> 32:31.200]  When we give them a lot of CalMag, a lot of calcium later on in life, they really loved
[32:31.200 --> 32:32.200]  it.
[32:32.200 --> 32:33.740]  Uh, they seem to feed moderately.
[32:33.740 --> 32:34.920]  Don't overfeed.
[32:34.920 --> 32:36.440]  Give them that CalMag.
[32:36.440 --> 32:38.080]  Uh, overfeeding nitrogen.
[32:38.080 --> 32:40.160]  That's the note I wanted to make sure to get you.
[32:40.160 --> 32:44.240]  Makes them stretchy and leafy, but they don't make buds.
[32:44.240 --> 32:49.560]  So early in flower, taper off that nitrogen, but pay attention to what they're doing.
[32:49.560 --> 32:53.320]  If they're getting yellow, keep that nitrogen going, but don't overdo it.
[32:53.320 --> 32:54.740]  They would rather be fed.
[32:54.740 --> 32:58.840]  So if you're a guy or a gal that feeds once every three days and then gives it water and
[32:58.840 --> 33:01.800]  then water and then feed, uh, I said that kind of weird.
[33:01.800 --> 33:05.300]  If you feed and then once a week and then give it water throughout the week, maybe feed
[33:05.300 --> 33:08.120]  twice a week, maybe feed three times a week.
[33:08.120 --> 33:13.080]  If you're growing in cocoa or hydro, definitely feed these bitches every time.
[33:13.080 --> 33:14.080]  Pay attention to your PPMs.
[33:14.080 --> 33:15.080]  Don't go too high.
[33:15.080 --> 33:20.240]  They would rather have low feeding every day than a high feeding, uh, one at a time.
[33:20.240 --> 33:23.660]  So, uh, feed them low and often.
[33:23.660 --> 33:27.020]  They love cocoa and auto water systems.
[33:27.020 --> 33:29.500]  They go crazy in aeroponics and cocoa.
[33:29.500 --> 33:33.680]  They clone like fucking crazy in an aeroponics cloner.
[33:33.680 --> 33:36.980]  Um, they explode in an easy cloner.
[33:36.980 --> 33:41.780]  These plants, I said it right here several times, they make crazy, crazy roots, but once
[33:41.780 --> 33:45.900]  those roots hit the walls, they stop growing.
[33:45.900 --> 33:47.480]  Let's talk about how I would grow these plants.
[33:47.480 --> 33:50.160]  I feel like I've got a lot to say and I feel like I've been going for a long time, but
[33:50.160 --> 33:51.160]  that's cool.
[33:51.160 --> 33:52.960]  Uh, let me take a drink and we'll continue with this.
[33:52.960 --> 33:54.120]  I'm going to take a sip.
[33:54.120 --> 34:01.980]  This is how I would grow these plants.
[34:01.980 --> 34:07.180]  I would veg them in a cup or a six inch net pot until you see them stop growing.
[34:07.180 --> 34:08.600]  That means they're root bound.
[34:08.600 --> 34:13.420]  As soon as they're caught, uh, then put them in a three or a five or a seven gallon pot.
[34:13.420 --> 34:18.660]  I would only transplant them one time because they grow so vigorously that that's a waste
[34:18.660 --> 34:22.160]  of time doing staggered or graduated pots.
[34:22.160 --> 34:27.960]  Go from your cup to your final big daddy, final shoes, uh, your graduation pot.
[34:27.960 --> 34:30.640]  So I would recommend either nine.
[34:30.640 --> 34:32.600]  No, let me start here on this note.
[34:32.600 --> 34:35.040]  I would recommend either five.
[34:35.040 --> 34:37.960]  Uh, no, that's not what I meant to even write.
[34:38.020 --> 34:44.780]  I would recommend four, seven gallon pots or six, five gallon pots, veg those.
[34:44.780 --> 34:49.060]  So let me say that again, cause I did stumble through the start of that for seven gallon
[34:49.060 --> 34:51.380]  pots per light.
[34:51.380 --> 34:53.220]  This is in like a five by five area.
[34:53.220 --> 34:58.300]  Uh, we're going to base this on a five by five tent or 1000 watt light or one of Keith's
[34:58.300 --> 34:59.860]  Canon LEDs.
[34:59.860 --> 35:02.860]  I would say four, seven gallon pots.
[35:02.860 --> 35:05.260]  So that's a section about this big as the pot.
[35:05.260 --> 35:07.340]  You'll start spreading them out as they grow.
[35:07.340 --> 35:10.900]  Four, seven gallons or six, five gallons.
[35:10.900 --> 35:13.900]  That's just a little bit smaller and a couple more plants.
[35:13.900 --> 35:17.980]  Depending on your plant count, this could be a very, very influential.
[35:17.980 --> 35:21.380]  If you've got a low plant count, do more big fucking plants.
[35:21.380 --> 35:22.380]  That's the way to do it.
[35:22.380 --> 35:25.100]  If you've got unlimited plants, just do a bunch of little plants and veg for like a
[35:25.100 --> 35:26.380]  week and flip them.
[35:26.380 --> 35:30.980]  Anyway, I would do four, seven gallon pots or six, five gallon pots.
[35:30.980 --> 35:33.180]  Veg those until they are about knee high.
[35:33.180 --> 35:34.680]  I'm a tall dude.
[35:34.680 --> 35:36.500]  Go to my knee.
[35:36.500 --> 35:37.500]  Tall knee.
[35:37.500 --> 35:39.460]  Uh, top those at that time.
[35:39.460 --> 35:44.020]  Then spread it out with either a tomato cage or a trellis net or sticks.
[35:44.020 --> 35:46.020]  You can put sticks in there angling out.
[35:46.020 --> 35:49.660]  You can put them angling in however you want to do it, but spread those tops out.
[35:49.660 --> 35:51.180]  So light gets to that whole plant.
[35:51.180 --> 35:52.460]  Uh, leaf it a little bit.
[35:52.460 --> 35:55.480]  So the plant penetrates or the light penetrates in there.
[35:55.480 --> 35:59.660]  So then you've got either four sevens or six fives veg to knee high.
[35:59.660 --> 36:00.900]  Top them, spread them out.
[36:00.900 --> 36:05.380]  Uh, let them recover, then flip them or, or here's another option.
[36:05.380 --> 36:10.220]  I would do nine, three gallon pots on the same footprint, just smaller plants.
[36:10.220 --> 36:11.740]  We're going to veg for less time.
[36:11.740 --> 36:16.500]  Uh, we're going to veg for like two, three, maybe four weeks at all in those fucking small
[36:16.500 --> 36:17.500]  pots.
[36:17.500 --> 36:18.500]  Then flip them.
[36:18.500 --> 36:21.100]  Do not top them in those small pots cause they're going to get tall.
[36:21.100 --> 36:23.500]  You just want that big one glory bud in there.
[36:23.500 --> 36:25.500]  Put a stick in there to hold up that glory cola.
[36:25.500 --> 36:27.260]  The rest will support itself.
[36:27.260 --> 36:33.220]  So either four sevens, six fives or nine threes is the way I would do it.
[36:33.220 --> 36:35.100]  If you do the threes, don't top them.
[36:35.820 --> 36:37.820]  The other ones definitely do top them.
[36:37.820 --> 36:40.020]  Um, one more thing to talk about.
[36:40.020 --> 36:43.380]  These plants are very bug resistant from what I've noticed.
[36:43.380 --> 36:49.580]  What I've also noticed is Jack Herro crosses and blueberry crosses are both bug resistant.
[36:49.580 --> 36:51.340]  We got both of those in here.
[36:51.340 --> 36:54.140]  So we're getting a lot of bug resistance.
[36:54.140 --> 36:55.740]  Something I should mention.
[36:55.740 --> 37:01.340]  Some of the people did report getting a rash from trimming these trees.
[37:01.340 --> 37:06.180]  People that are allergic to hazes and blue dream are also allergic to this plant.
[37:06.180 --> 37:10.900]  I've done an episode all about plant rashes and getting a rash from trimming.
[37:10.900 --> 37:11.900]  Guess what?
[37:11.900 --> 37:15.660]  Those same people got a rash from trimming this cross.
[37:15.660 --> 37:17.180]  It's something in the blueberry.
[37:17.180 --> 37:18.800]  It's something in the haze.
[37:18.800 --> 37:22.180]  Something in that is giving them a rash and a histamine reaction.
[37:22.180 --> 37:25.780]  So people were getting hives and an arm rash from trimming this strain.
[37:25.780 --> 37:27.800]  I just want to give you a disclaimer.
[37:27.800 --> 37:33.680]  If the hazes or the blueberry, if blue dream gave you a rash, this one will from trimming it.
[37:33.680 --> 37:37.760]  Those people can smoke it once it's dried and cured, but they cannot trim it.
[37:37.760 --> 37:38.760]  Kind of weird.
[37:38.760 --> 37:39.760]  All right.
[37:39.760 --> 37:42.640]  Um, I said I would talk about phenotypes.
[37:42.640 --> 37:45.680]  I feel like this is a long podcast, but you guys should love this.
[37:45.680 --> 37:46.680]  Phenotypes.
[37:46.680 --> 37:49.800]  There obviously is a blueberry cookies phenotype.
[37:49.800 --> 37:51.920]  It is the blueberry cookies cross.
[37:51.920 --> 37:54.720]  It has got the blue Skittles flavors.
[37:54.720 --> 37:56.800]  It's got blue Skittles, blue raspberries.
[37:56.800 --> 38:01.000]  Most of that wangling a bling bling blue flavor comes from the blueberry cookies.
[38:01.000 --> 38:07.120]  It is the wider leaf phenotype that comes from the Tahoe in the blueberry cookies.
[38:07.120 --> 38:12.800]  There's also a Jack hair phenotype that one's got haze, maybe a little bit of peppermint,
[38:12.800 --> 38:14.980]  maybe some sandalwood and skunk.
[38:14.980 --> 38:19.040]  Those are going to be the longer, longest finishing phenotypes.
[38:19.040 --> 38:22.040]  There may be a little bit of Jack, uh, maybe a little bit of lamb's bread in there.
[38:22.040 --> 38:26.920]  That spiciness, that sandalwood, maybe a little bit of the, the, uh, lamb's bread coming
[38:26.920 --> 38:30.040]  through, but that's a lot of Jack hair in that phenotype.
[38:30.040 --> 38:34.820]  There's a Jack, the ripper phenotype, which is lemons and rotten fruit.
[38:34.820 --> 38:36.240]  And I love it.
[38:36.240 --> 38:40.280]  Then ladies and gentlemen, here's the official name of this strain.
[38:40.280 --> 38:44.320]  We've gotten this far into this podcast and I haven't told you the name of this strain.
[38:44.320 --> 38:46.960]  I'm so good at building suspense.
[38:46.960 --> 38:49.680]  The name of this cross is the blueberry butcher.
[38:49.680 --> 38:53.200]  Shout out to Lovin in her eyes for throwing that name in the hat.
[38:53.200 --> 38:54.400]  I love it.
[38:54.400 --> 38:55.400]  Blueberry butcher.
[38:55.400 --> 38:59.680]  I tossed around a lot of ideas that always came back to blueberry butcher.
[38:59.680 --> 39:02.960]  So shout out to Lovin in her eyes for a great name.
[39:02.960 --> 39:04.280]  You're going to get a pack for show.
[39:04.280 --> 39:05.280]  I hope you grow it.
[39:05.280 --> 39:06.320]  Hope you breed with it.
[39:06.320 --> 39:09.840]  But the blueberry butcher was named by Lovin in her eyes.
[39:09.840 --> 39:10.840]  It's a great name.
[39:10.840 --> 39:13.420]  Jack the ripper was a serial killer, blueberry cookies.
[39:13.420 --> 39:15.440]  I wanted to maybe name it serial killer.
[39:15.440 --> 39:16.580]  That would have been cool.
[39:16.580 --> 39:17.960]  That may get used for something else.
[39:17.960 --> 39:18.960]  Don't steal it.
[39:19.240 --> 39:24.080]  Serial, not S-E-R-I-L-I-A whatever L. We got lost there.
[39:24.080 --> 39:26.760]  But serial, like the breakfast serial killer.
[39:26.760 --> 39:30.520]  Anyway, this is blueberry butcher.
[39:30.520 --> 39:31.520]  Beautiful name.
[39:31.520 --> 39:35.760]  Let's talk about the phenotype, which I have named the blueberry butcher.
[39:35.760 --> 39:43.000]  It is the blueberry cookies structure, but the Jack the Ripper rotten mango, lemon lime
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.920]  funk, red bull smell.
[39:45.920 --> 39:47.440]  That's a lot of stuff to take in.
[39:47.600 --> 39:52.280]  The blueberry butcher, it is the blueberry cookies structure.
[39:52.280 --> 39:53.480]  It's tall.
[39:53.480 --> 39:55.060]  It's got jagged leaves.
[39:55.060 --> 39:57.400]  It just looks like a classic cannabis plant.
[39:57.400 --> 40:01.600]  If you saw the silhouette, you'd go, that's the weed they used to put in pictures.
[40:01.600 --> 40:03.920]  It is fucking photogenic weed.
[40:03.920 --> 40:07.800]  It's the blueberry cookie structure, very well supported, very stout.
[40:07.800 --> 40:11.300]  Some of the others are a little skinny, a little wispy, definitely need support.
[40:11.300 --> 40:15.040]  The blueberry cookies dominant structure will support itself.
[40:15.040 --> 40:17.160]  Very, very sturdy, very stout.
[40:17.160 --> 40:19.720]  It's got that stout structure, which you're looking for.
[40:19.720 --> 40:21.560]  You want plants that will hold themselves up.
[40:21.560 --> 40:23.880]  They could build great big buds on themselves.
[40:23.880 --> 40:24.880]  That's what we want.
[40:24.880 --> 40:27.080]  Takes popping and twisting very well.
[40:27.080 --> 40:31.080]  Then it's got that Jack the Ripper rotten mango flavor to it.
[40:31.080 --> 40:34.720]  Almost, and when I say this flavor, people wrinkle up their noses and they cringe, but
[40:34.720 --> 40:36.680]  it smells like a bar trash can.
[40:36.680 --> 40:40.880]  A little bit of fermented funk and vomit, along with a little bit of rotten mango and
[40:40.880 --> 40:45.640]  dirty fruit, a little bit of feet going on, a little bit of baby shit and baby food.
[40:45.640 --> 40:47.120]  It sounds terrible, right?
[40:47.120 --> 40:48.120]  No.
[40:48.120 --> 40:51.520]  If you're a cannabis consumer, a cannabis connoisseur, you're going, damn, I need a
[40:51.520 --> 40:53.120]  fucking bag of that.
[40:53.120 --> 41:00.040]  Also, it's got lemon lime funk and a little bit of Red Bull or chewable Flintstones vitamins,
[41:00.040 --> 41:02.320]  the purple color to be more specific.
[41:02.320 --> 41:04.880]  The dinos, I think they are.
[41:04.880 --> 41:08.200]  That is the blueberry butcher phenotype specifically.
[41:08.200 --> 41:10.280]  That is the one I'm after.
[41:10.280 --> 41:14.100]  A lot of times people want to talk about phenotypes and they're like, what phenotype is this?
[41:14.100 --> 41:16.280]  What is this called?
[41:16.440 --> 41:18.240]  Find the one that you like.
[41:18.240 --> 41:21.600]  I'm telling you which one I like, but I want you to grow this and find the phenotype that
[41:21.600 --> 41:23.040]  blows your mind.
[41:23.040 --> 41:25.840]  Who cares if that girl makes me happy?
[41:25.840 --> 41:26.960]  She's in your garden.
[41:26.960 --> 41:30.480]  Find the girl that makes ... Find that blueberry butcher that makes you happy.
[41:30.480 --> 41:33.000]  Find the Jack the Ripper phenotype that you love.
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.320]  Find the one that is for you, but that is the phenotype I really love, the blueberry
[41:36.320 --> 41:37.480]  butcher.
[41:37.480 --> 41:39.720]  It's got the structure of the blueberry cookies.
[41:39.720 --> 41:41.400]  It's got the potency.
[41:41.400 --> 41:45.480]  The blueberry cookies is kind of, it'll put you down or it'll make you think weird, but
[41:45.480 --> 41:48.840]  then the Jack the Ripper comes in and adds to that and it just fucking lifts your head
[41:48.840 --> 41:49.840]  up.
[41:49.840 --> 41:52.600]  It pulls the rug out from underneath you and you're like, where are my keys?
[41:52.600 --> 41:54.280]  You're like, they're in your hand, bro.
[41:54.280 --> 41:55.880]  You're like, oh, all right, where do we park?
[41:55.880 --> 41:57.280]  You're like, you're parked, bro.
[41:57.280 --> 41:58.680]  It's one of those kind of things.
[41:58.680 --> 42:00.280]  I really love it.
[42:00.280 --> 42:04.120]  There's another phenotype that is not as common, but does pop up.
[42:04.120 --> 42:06.200]  This one is purple.
[42:06.200 --> 42:08.960]  It's the purple butcher.
[42:08.960 --> 42:10.900]  It's not as potent, in my opinion.
[42:10.900 --> 42:13.060]  It doesn't have that psychedelia to it.
[42:13.060 --> 42:14.060]  It's more sedative.
[42:14.060 --> 42:15.540]  It'll lay you the fuck down.
[42:15.540 --> 42:17.440]  It finishes super early.
[42:17.440 --> 42:18.480]  It's a shorter plant.
[42:18.480 --> 42:20.640]  It's a squattier, bushier plant.
[42:20.640 --> 42:23.640]  It's really easy to find early on in the cycle.
[42:23.640 --> 42:28.040]  When you see those big fat leaves and the plant that doesn't grow tall, the others will
[42:28.040 --> 42:29.040]  take off on you.
[42:29.040 --> 42:31.880]  They'll get almost a fishing pole thing if you don't have enough light.
[42:31.880 --> 42:33.140]  They'll get tall.
[42:33.140 --> 42:39.280]  If it's short, squatty and makes up at the nodes where the nodes meet the branch, it
[42:39.280 --> 42:42.840]  has like a little extra, I don't even know what to call it.
[42:42.860 --> 42:46.340]  Not webbing, but a little extra callous looking spot.
[42:46.340 --> 42:49.060]  Somebody will tell me what that technical term is now that I've mentioned that I don't
[42:49.060 --> 42:50.700]  know what that's called.
[42:50.700 --> 42:54.140]  It looks like instead of the branches just coming out, they've got a little extra suction
[42:54.140 --> 42:56.180]  making them a little more sturdy.
[42:56.180 --> 43:00.460]  A lot of those phenotypes will end up being the shortier squat phenotype that makes purple
[43:00.460 --> 43:01.720]  buds.
[43:01.720 --> 43:07.240]  Those purple buds, they smell like lavender and lemons.
[43:07.240 --> 43:11.740]  Those have that chewable vitamin and dirty feet.
[43:11.760 --> 43:12.760]  Elderberries.
[43:12.760 --> 43:13.760]  Is it elderberries?
[43:13.760 --> 43:17.560]  That may be ... There's an aroma that I'm thinking of an older vitamin from the health
[43:17.560 --> 43:18.560]  food store.
[43:18.560 --> 43:19.560]  Yeah, dude, it's elderberries.
[43:19.560 --> 43:23.900]  Yep, it's elderberries and something else purple from the health food store and those
[43:23.900 --> 43:25.480]  chewable fucking vitamins.
[43:25.480 --> 43:26.480]  That's what it smells like.
[43:26.480 --> 43:28.960]  I can taste it and smell it in my mouth right now.
[43:28.960 --> 43:36.040]  Lavender, lilacs, elderberries, elderberry tea with honey in it.
[43:36.040 --> 43:37.200]  And Flintstones vitamins.
[43:37.200 --> 43:39.720]  That's a purple phenotype.
[43:39.720 --> 43:40.720]  Those are the phenotypes.
[43:40.720 --> 43:43.600]  There's the blueberry cookies phenotype that tastes like blue Skittles.
[43:43.600 --> 43:45.420]  It's got the whiter leaves.
[43:45.420 --> 43:47.740]  It's kind of got that Tahoe going on.
[43:47.740 --> 43:49.200]  There's the Jack Harer phenotype.
[43:49.200 --> 43:51.600]  It's hazy, sandalwood, skunk.
[43:51.600 --> 43:53.280]  That's going to be a long finisher.
[43:53.280 --> 43:56.600]  The Jack the Ripper phenotype will be kind of a quick finisher.
[43:56.600 --> 43:58.320]  Not as long as that Jack Harer finisher.
[43:58.320 --> 44:00.080]  That's lemons and rotten fruit.
[44:00.080 --> 44:01.900]  Then we got the blueberry butcher.
[44:01.900 --> 44:07.260]  That is the blue cookie structure with that mango, the wango, tango, lemon, lime, red
[44:07.260 --> 44:09.000]  bull and vitamin sort of flavor.
[44:09.000 --> 44:12.880]  Then there's that purple one, which in my opinion, isn't the desirable phenotype, but
[44:12.880 --> 44:14.080]  it will pop up.
[44:14.080 --> 44:18.740]  If you've got the clientele that's into purple, this one will pay the bills for you there.
[44:18.740 --> 44:20.760]  All of the phenotypes, I recommend you top them.
[44:20.760 --> 44:22.280]  You'll see where to top them.
[44:22.280 --> 44:26.320]  If you're not good at topping plants, this plant will tell you, top me here.
[44:26.320 --> 44:29.480]  It'll make a nice bottom and the one will just shoot up right out of the top.
[44:29.480 --> 44:31.900]  And you'll go, that's the fucking thing that needs to come out.
[44:31.900 --> 44:35.200]  Follow it down until it looks like you got a nice even canopy and take that bitch right
[44:35.200 --> 44:36.360]  out of there.
[44:36.360 --> 44:38.620]  Clone that top because they make beautiful clones.
[44:38.740 --> 44:41.700]  This plant clones very, very easily.
[44:41.700 --> 44:45.980]  Some of its assets and features, attributes will give you a headache.
[44:45.980 --> 44:47.980]  That cloning part, simple as fuck.
[44:47.980 --> 44:51.420]  It'll clone so easily for you.
[44:51.420 --> 44:53.580]  Expect around 70 days finishing time.
[44:53.580 --> 44:55.960]  Some people told me they went 82 days.
[44:55.960 --> 44:59.320]  Some people said they did 65 and really wish they had gone longer.
[44:59.320 --> 45:01.780]  So let it go 70, 72 days.
[45:01.780 --> 45:02.780]  Check those trichomes.
[45:02.780 --> 45:04.900]  It is all about the trichomes.
[45:04.900 --> 45:08.520]  As a breeder, I'm going to say some people went 82 days.
[45:09.420 --> 45:12.240]  There are 80 day phenotypes in these packs of seeds.
[45:12.240 --> 45:14.000]  You guys, I'm not going to bullshit you.
[45:14.000 --> 45:20.220]  The blueberry butcher can go up to 82 days, but it puts out giant harvest weights.
[45:20.220 --> 45:24.080]  People were bragging about how much they pulled off their test plants.
[45:24.080 --> 45:30.040]  So the test plants were banging out production, usable weight, profitable weight.
[45:30.040 --> 45:32.360]  Also it is highly potent.
[45:32.360 --> 45:34.000]  I said potent, my voice cut out there.
[45:34.000 --> 45:35.400]  Sorry, let me take another drink.
[45:35.400 --> 45:39.210]  All right.
[45:39.210 --> 45:41.170]  Who knows where I'm going to add it.
[45:41.290 --> 45:46.810]  Most of these phenotypes will put out great harvest weights and most of them will be ridiculously
[45:46.810 --> 45:47.810]  potent.
[45:47.810 --> 45:51.250]  All of the photos you saw, all of the plants were just coated in trichomes.
[45:51.250 --> 45:55.690]  Maybe I'll scroll a couple photos through right here, but they were all coated in resin.
[45:55.690 --> 45:57.330]  They all smelled amazing.
[45:57.330 --> 46:03.110]  Super potent, big fat harvest, super great bag appeal and a beautiful name.
[46:03.110 --> 46:05.610]  So that is the blueberry butcher.
[46:05.610 --> 46:11.370]  I owe a big shout out to everybody who tested seeds for me on this round.
[46:11.370 --> 46:16.510]  If you were testing any of the Jack the Ripper crosses, there was a Jack the Ripper to blueberry
[46:16.510 --> 46:17.510]  cookies.
[46:17.510 --> 46:20.670]  If you tested that, you can name it blueberry butcher.
[46:20.670 --> 46:25.110]  That is what you can write on the package, on the jar, on the plants, on the clones.
[46:25.110 --> 46:26.730]  Those are blueberry butcher.
[46:26.730 --> 46:32.170]  The blueberry cookies female cross to the Jack the Ripper male is officially blueberry
[46:32.170 --> 46:33.170]  butcher.
[46:33.170 --> 46:35.050]  You heard it here first on this podcast.
[46:35.050 --> 46:38.290]  I will say that again on my Monday night Instagram live.
[46:38.290 --> 46:42.090]  Hey, if you don't watch the Monday night Instagram live, join me this Monday on Instagram.
[46:42.090 --> 46:45.190]  Every Monday, approximately 7 10 mountain time.
[46:45.190 --> 46:48.330]  That's Colorado time at 7 10 PM in the mountain time zone.
[46:48.330 --> 46:49.330]  I don't know where you are.
[46:49.330 --> 46:50.370]  You could be specific time.
[46:50.370 --> 46:51.810]  You could be Pacific time.
[46:51.810 --> 46:53.410]  You could be East Coast time.
[46:53.410 --> 46:55.910]  You could be somewhere else in the fucking world.
[46:55.910 --> 46:59.250]  You could be in China for all I know where it's 14 hours ahead of me.
[46:59.250 --> 47:00.790]  You could watch from there.
[47:00.790 --> 47:01.790]  Check me out on Instagram.
[47:01.790 --> 47:03.210]  I re underscore genetics.
[47:03.210 --> 47:08.170]  Check out all the great photos that the testers posted, but on the Monday show, I'm going
[47:08.170 --> 47:09.170]  to talk about this strain.
[47:09.170 --> 47:11.850]  I'm sure people will have questions once they hear this.
[47:11.850 --> 47:14.330]  So blueberry butcher.
[47:14.330 --> 47:17.330]  The next question is going to be, where do I get blueberry butcher?
[47:17.330 --> 47:25.530]  The first place you can find blueberry butcher is seeds here now.com use coupon code GFYH10.
[47:25.530 --> 47:27.670]  That'll save you 10% off your full order.
[47:27.670 --> 47:31.130]  There will be more iri genetics dropping on four 20.
[47:31.130 --> 47:34.010]  I'm going to release the Jack the Ripper F twos.
[47:34.010 --> 47:37.890]  There will be at least two phenotypes that I have approved for release.
[47:37.890 --> 47:38.890]  They're packaged up.
[47:38.890 --> 47:39.890]  They're ready to go.
[47:39.890 --> 47:41.610]  There'll be number two and number four.
[47:41.610 --> 47:44.450]  I will explain the differences on my website.
[47:44.450 --> 47:45.450]  Check out my website.
[47:45.450 --> 47:47.930]  I re genetics.com.
[47:47.930 --> 47:49.170]  Those will drop on four 20.
[47:49.170 --> 47:51.810]  There'll be a lot of other great stuff dropping.
[47:51.810 --> 47:53.970]  I feel like I really got on a ramble.
[47:53.970 --> 47:54.970]  Check out the Monday show.
[47:54.970 --> 47:56.450]  I'll take, check out the strain there.
[47:56.450 --> 47:58.110]  Also check out seeds here now.com.
[47:58.110 --> 48:00.650]  That's where there'll be available and shout out to the testers.
[48:00.650 --> 48:01.650]  We're back on track.
[48:01.650 --> 48:05.090]  Now seeds here now.com will be the first place to get them.
[48:05.090 --> 48:06.370]  Make sure you check out the website.
[48:06.370 --> 48:08.290]  I re genetics.com.
[48:08.290 --> 48:13.210]  There'll be full strain descriptions on the Jack the Ripper F twos, a full strain description
[48:13.210 --> 48:14.810]  on the blueberry butcher.
[48:14.810 --> 48:19.710]  If I do decide to release anything else for four 20, it will be posted up there.
[48:19.710 --> 48:25.910]  Also details on the sale, the drop and releases will be included in my mail chimp newsletter.
[48:25.910 --> 48:26.910]  How do you get that?
[48:26.910 --> 48:27.910]  You go to my website.
[48:27.910 --> 48:29.650]  I re genetics.com.
[48:29.650 --> 48:32.770]  Halfway down, there's a spot that says, join the newsletter.
[48:32.770 --> 48:35.090]  Type in your email address, click enter there.
[48:35.090 --> 48:37.450]  That will send you to my mail chimp.
[48:37.450 --> 48:40.130]  Every time I type a new newsletter, you'll get the newsletter.
[48:40.130 --> 48:44.770]  You'll get a notification and update of what's going on with the I read genetics world.
[48:44.770 --> 48:45.770]  It could be a new drop.
[48:45.770 --> 48:46.770]  It could be a new strain.
[48:46.770 --> 48:47.770]  It could be a giveaway.
[48:47.770 --> 48:49.170]  It could be a contest.
[48:49.170 --> 48:52.290]  Who knows what's coming up in the summer with I re genetics?
[48:52.290 --> 48:54.550]  Well, that was a mouthful.
[48:54.550 --> 48:56.090]  You guys had a lot to say on this show.
[48:56.090 --> 48:57.650]  This was a good time.
[48:57.650 --> 48:59.890]  Check out the blueberry butcher at seeds here now.com.
[48:59.890 --> 49:03.330]  Shout out to my testers just in case I went over that too quickly.
[49:03.330 --> 49:05.250]  You guys, this was a fun episode.
[49:05.250 --> 49:06.310]  I want your feedback.
[49:06.310 --> 49:10.690]  If you're growing, if you do grow this one, send me some feedback, send me updates.
[49:10.690 --> 49:15.730]  This was tested by a solid test crew, but a lot more seeds are going to go out.
[49:15.730 --> 49:20.610]  A lot more people are going to be growing this, so we're going to get a lot more discoveries.
[49:20.610 --> 49:21.610]  Don't be shy.
[49:21.610 --> 49:22.610]  Send me your photos.
[49:22.610 --> 49:23.610]  Send me your feedback.
[49:23.610 --> 49:24.610]  Send me your updates.
[49:24.610 --> 49:27.770]  My favorite part of this episode is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[49:27.770 --> 49:31.690]  I'd love to get some feedback on the Jack the Ripper crosses and anything you've grown
[49:31.690 --> 49:32.690]  from mine.
[49:32.690 --> 49:37.330]  If you've got pictures, photos, questions, concerns, updates, feedback, any of that stuff,
[49:37.330 --> 49:38.850]  I'm open to all of it.
[49:38.850 --> 49:41.810]  Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[49:41.810 --> 49:42.850]  What else do we got?
[49:42.850 --> 49:43.890]  Let's do this part.

[49:48.090 --> 49:49.090]  something.
[49:49.090 --> 49:50.690]  Maybe I improved your garden over time.
[49:50.690 --> 49:51.950]  Maybe I made you giggle.
[49:51.950 --> 49:55.470]  Maybe I'm just keeping you company during quarantine and keeping your sanity.
[49:55.470 --> 49:58.190]  Maybe you'd like to contribute to the show financially.

[50:51.570 --> 50:55.170]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy Grimble the Druid.
[50:55.170 --> 50:58.770]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
