[00:25.020 --> 00:29.440]  Yeah, what's up ladies and gentlemen, it's time for episode number 41 of the iGrow Culture
[00:29.440 --> 00:30.440]  Podcast.
[00:30.440 --> 00:31.440]  I'm your host, Ross DeGeff.
[00:31.440 --> 00:32.440]  Thanks for joining me for another episode.
[00:32.440 --> 00:33.900]  I'm excited to be here.
[00:33.900 --> 00:36.460]  Joining me on mic tonight, our good buddy Mike is back.
[00:36.460 --> 00:37.460]  What's up everybody?
[00:37.460 --> 00:38.780]  And our good buddy Adam is here.
[00:38.780 --> 00:39.780]  Yo.
[00:39.780 --> 00:40.780]  Adam hasn't been here for a while.
[00:40.780 --> 00:41.780]  How are you doing bro?
[00:41.780 --> 00:42.780]  I'm tired.
[00:42.780 --> 00:43.780]  Tired?
[00:43.780 --> 00:44.780]  Tired.
[00:44.780 --> 00:45.780]  Sick and tired?
[00:45.780 --> 00:46.780]  Yeah.
[00:46.780 --> 00:47.780]  Work.
[00:47.780 --> 00:48.780]  Work.
[00:48.780 --> 00:49.780]  Well, it's about time you're doing some work.
[00:49.780 --> 00:50.780]  You had a little mini vacation.
[00:50.780 --> 00:51.780]  Yeah, it was longer than a mini vacation.
[00:51.780 --> 00:52.780]  Yeah, well.
[00:52.780 --> 00:53.780]  Thank you man.
[00:53.780 --> 00:54.780]  Welcome back to the working community.
[00:54.780 --> 00:56.780]  We're going to talk a little bit and get a podcast going.
[00:56.780 --> 00:59.320]  We're going to talk about some cool stuff.
[00:59.320 --> 01:00.320]  Somebody was supposed to come.
[01:00.320 --> 01:01.660]  I'm not blaming anything on Jesse.
[01:01.660 --> 01:02.660]  Jesse was trying to make it.
[01:02.660 --> 01:03.940]  He can't make it tonight, unfortunately.
[01:03.940 --> 01:06.340]  So had to kind of replan the show.
[01:06.340 --> 01:07.340]  Can we blame it on Jesse?
[01:07.340 --> 01:08.340]  We can.
[01:08.340 --> 01:09.340]  It's Jesse's fault.
[01:09.340 --> 01:10.340]  Jesse couldn't make it.
[01:10.340 --> 01:11.340]  So we're not going to.
[01:11.340 --> 01:15.340]  No, actually, Jesse has been trying to get an electrician to his new grow facility and
[01:15.340 --> 01:16.700]  that dude's been putting him off.
[01:16.700 --> 01:19.380]  And tonight he showed up and he called me and I was like, dude, do that.
[01:19.380 --> 01:22.180]  Because I know how hard it is to get an electrician to your facility.
[01:22.180 --> 01:24.860]  And once he's there, you're paying him and it's hard to get him there.
[01:24.860 --> 01:26.260]  So just keep him there and get the work done.
[01:26.260 --> 01:28.040]  So Jesse had to take a rain check.
[01:28.040 --> 01:31.100]  If he can come over later or tomorrow, I'll put out another show in the middle of the
[01:31.100 --> 01:32.100]  week with Jesse.
[01:32.100 --> 01:33.100]  Do it.
[01:33.100 --> 01:34.100]  Nice.
[01:34.100 --> 01:35.100]  Yeah.
[01:35.100 --> 01:36.740]  Jesse was kind enough to host another party at Hygro last night.
[01:36.740 --> 01:38.380]  We'll talk about that a little bit.
[01:38.380 --> 01:41.520]  I need to, before I even forget, before I have a chance to forget, I need to give a
[01:41.520 --> 01:47.940]  huge shout out to NanoLux Lighting and Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[01:47.940 --> 01:49.700]  Everyone just looked over across the room here.
[01:49.700 --> 01:51.100]  There's a brand new.
[01:51.100 --> 01:52.100]  Pretty new toy.
[01:53.020 --> 01:56.980]  Dual ended bulb and a ballast and reflector all attached into one piece.
[01:56.980 --> 02:03.300]  It's the new NanoLux 1000 watt that actually has a 1200 watt setting on it.
[02:03.300 --> 02:06.380]  So I'm going to be cranking 1200 watts in one section and we're going to see what that
[02:06.380 --> 02:07.380]  light does.
[02:07.380 --> 02:08.780]  They gave it to me to run it.
[02:08.780 --> 02:10.140]  They said, run a couple cycles.
[02:10.140 --> 02:12.660]  Let us know what you think and we'll talk about the future.
[02:12.660 --> 02:17.780]  So if that works out, NanoLux may be a podcast sponsor in the future here.
[02:17.780 --> 02:20.220]  It's a really, really cool new toy.
[02:20.220 --> 02:21.580]  I can't wait to see what she does.
[02:21.580 --> 02:22.580]  Yeah, me too.
[02:22.580 --> 02:24.220]  It's a fancy looking light for sure.
[02:24.220 --> 02:25.220]  It is.
[02:25.220 --> 02:29.460]  It's one of the dual ended bulbs and it's the kind that's got the ballast and it's got
[02:29.460 --> 02:31.260]  a short reflector and I kind of like it.
[02:31.260 --> 02:34.340]  It's got it all in one piece and it all hangs from the ceiling.
[02:34.340 --> 02:36.700]  It's only the, is it 240 or 220?
[02:36.700 --> 02:38.900]  It's only the 240 plug.
[02:38.900 --> 02:39.900]  I always get that one confused.
[02:39.900 --> 02:42.300]  Sorry, I'm not good with remembering that many goddamn numbers.
[02:42.300 --> 02:45.060]  They mess with my brain, but I have a good feeling about that.
[02:45.060 --> 02:46.500]  I've heard a lot of good stuff.
[02:46.500 --> 02:49.420]  They gave it to me because they know I'm going to kick ass with it and see what it does.
[02:49.980 --> 02:52.780]  Yeah, I probably should have asked before I touched, but that's one of the first things
[02:52.780 --> 02:53.780]  I did when I walked in.
[02:53.780 --> 02:55.300]  Yeah, Adam walked in and just opened the box.
[02:55.300 --> 02:56.300]  Yeah, I looked at it.
[02:56.300 --> 02:57.300]  I watched it.
[02:57.300 --> 02:58.300]  I didn't give too much of a shit.
[02:58.300 --> 02:59.300]  I was just looking.
[02:59.300 --> 03:00.300]  I just wanted to see if it was still in the box.
[03:00.300 --> 03:01.300]  You're not going to break anything.
[03:01.300 --> 03:03.060]  If you do, you get to buy me a new light.
[03:03.060 --> 03:04.060]  That's cool.
[03:04.060 --> 03:05.060]  Yep.
[03:05.060 --> 03:06.060]  What else are we going to talk about?
[03:06.060 --> 03:09.060]  We all sat around today like a bunch of bros and took dabs and watched a movie.
[03:09.060 --> 03:11.820]  We're going to talk a little bit about that.
[03:11.820 --> 03:16.420]  We're actually going to watch a video on the show together because some of us have seen
[03:16.420 --> 03:18.300]  it, some haven't, and I want to watch it.
[03:18.700 --> 03:21.060]  I haven't seen it to tell you the truth, and I know I need to watch it.
[03:21.060 --> 03:24.460]  I want to watch it live on the podcast so that I can give you my reaction live on the
[03:24.460 --> 03:25.460]  air.
[03:25.460 --> 03:26.460]  It'll be fun.
[03:26.460 --> 03:29.540]  But before we get that far, we have to do this stuff right here.
[03:29.540 --> 03:33.680]  This podcast is brought to you by our good friends at Highly Educated Titanium.
[03:33.680 --> 03:38.020]  If you're using high quality concentrates, you deserve a high quality titanium nail made
[03:38.020 --> 03:39.340]  in America.
[03:39.340 --> 03:42.860]  Don't trust a Chinese nail or an American knockoff made of cheap metals.
[03:42.860 --> 03:44.380]  Trust the industry leader.
[03:44.380 --> 03:45.620]  Trust the innovator.
[03:45.620 --> 03:46.720]  Trust the king.
[03:46.720 --> 03:48.360]  Highly Educated Titanium.
[03:48.360 --> 03:50.000]  Big huge shout out to Task Rock.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.640]  Dude, Task is making these new dabbers.
[03:52.640 --> 03:55.160]  He's learned this new coloring method so that he can color his titanium.
[03:55.160 --> 03:56.800]  Some of them look really sick.
[03:56.800 --> 03:58.160]  Shout out to Task.
[03:58.160 --> 04:02.040]  From time to time when I'm scrolling through YouTube, or not YouTube, Facebook.
[04:02.040 --> 04:03.040]  Instagram.
[04:03.040 --> 04:04.040]  Instagram as well.
[04:04.040 --> 04:07.040]  I'm going to push that mic a little closer to your face.
[04:07.040 --> 04:08.040]  That's so much better.
[04:08.040 --> 04:10.200]  You just got that tone that it gets lost in the mics.
[04:10.200 --> 04:11.280]  That tone is hard to record.
[04:11.280 --> 04:13.680]  It takes me a minute to get comfortable at the beginning of every show.
[04:13.680 --> 04:14.680]  Sorry, listeners.
[04:14.680 --> 04:15.680]  We'll get you here.
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.920]  I was going to talk about this in a minute.
[04:17.920 --> 04:18.920]  So I'm going to finish this ad.
[04:18.920 --> 04:21.600]  Check out highlyeducatedti.com for more information.
[04:21.600 --> 04:25.720]  If you want to buy some highly educated products, go to aqualabtechnologies.com and search for
[04:25.720 --> 04:26.720]  highly educated.
[04:26.720 --> 04:28.960]  Got a bunch of great stuff there.
[04:28.960 --> 04:30.240]  Huge shout out while I'm thinking about it.
[04:30.240 --> 04:35.920]  Jesse last night, dude, at the Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies Grower meeting gave a class
[04:35.920 --> 04:38.440]  lecture on taking clones.
[04:38.440 --> 04:40.080]  Nice little clone lesson, yeah.
[04:40.080 --> 04:41.360]  That dude killed it, bro.
[04:41.360 --> 04:43.080]  He actually did a hell of a good job.
[04:43.080 --> 04:44.560]  We're going to cut this music out.
[04:44.560 --> 04:45.960]  I don't know what's next on the playlist.
[04:45.960 --> 04:49.840]  I need to give a big shout out to the Mystic Roots Band and Coot Dog and Stay Positive Sound,
[04:49.840 --> 04:51.000]  Stay Positive Productions.
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.080]  They have given me full permission to play all of the Mystic Roots library on my podcast.
[04:56.080 --> 04:57.080]  That's freaking awesome.
[04:57.080 --> 04:58.080]  Awesome, man.
[04:58.080 --> 04:59.080]  Super awesome.
[04:59.080 --> 05:02.180]  The track you just heard was DJ and a Dance, the instrumental version.
[05:02.180 --> 05:05.900]  They were kind enough to send me every track they've done instrumental.
[05:05.900 --> 05:08.160]  So now we've got a lot of fresh music for the show.
[05:08.160 --> 05:09.160]  Nice.
[05:09.160 --> 05:10.160]  I like it.
[05:10.160 --> 05:11.160]  So shout out to Jesse, dude.
[05:11.160 --> 05:13.480]  He did a hell of a good job hosting that party last night.
[05:13.480 --> 05:14.480]  Yeah.
[05:14.500 --> 05:17.560]  We'll talk about that in a minute, but I wanted to get that shout out before I forget, because
[05:17.560 --> 05:19.840]  for some reason I get forgetful.
[05:19.840 --> 05:20.840]  That'll happen.
[05:20.840 --> 05:21.840]  Yeah.
[05:21.840 --> 05:22.840]  We're going to take a dab here in a minute.
[05:22.840 --> 05:25.240]  Everyone was talking about a pre-show dab, and I wanted to get the ads out of the way
[05:25.240 --> 05:30.000]  and get those done right before I got super dabbed out and start coughing again.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.480]  This podcast is always brought to you by naturesgreenremedies.com.

[06:14.920 --> 06:17.120]  That's a good ad to throw in later.
[06:17.120 --> 06:20.520]  Be warned, there's a commercial coming up later, guys.
[06:20.520 --> 06:24.240]  I've been watching my buddy Ryan's Instagram and Facebook, and that dude's having a good
[06:24.240 --> 06:25.240]  ass time.
[06:25.240 --> 06:26.240]  I'm proud of you, Ryan.
[06:26.240 --> 06:29.360]  Ryan is actually the guy from treethugger.com.
[06:29.360 --> 06:31.840]  Treethugger.com is a big sponsor of our show.
[06:31.840 --> 06:32.840]  They help us out a lot.
[06:32.840 --> 06:35.520]  You guys don't even know what Ryan does for us.
[06:35.520 --> 06:39.880]  So this podcast is brought to you by treethugger.com, live music lifestyle magazine.

[06:49.000 --> 06:51.040]  You're doing well.
[06:51.040 --> 06:52.400]  I think that's enough commercials, right?
[06:52.400 --> 06:53.400]  We paid all the dues.
[06:53.400 --> 06:54.680]  I got this one sitting aside here.
[06:54.680 --> 06:56.600]  We'll cover that one.
[06:56.600 --> 06:57.600]  Big shout out to the sponsors.
[06:57.600 --> 07:01.240]  I know it sounds weird having sponsors on a podcast, but they help out a lot.
[07:01.240 --> 07:02.880]  It takes a lot of time.
[07:02.880 --> 07:05.320]  I get products, helps out, adds content.
[07:05.320 --> 07:06.840]  I really appreciate the sponsors.
[07:06.840 --> 07:08.800]  Tazka, you got my email today.
[07:08.800 --> 07:09.800]  Read that, bro.
[07:10.720 --> 07:11.720]  Let's see.
[07:11.720 --> 07:13.200]  We don't have any comments to read.
[07:13.200 --> 07:14.480]  So guess what that means, guys?
[07:14.480 --> 07:19.040]  It's time to take a quick dab and then we're going to come back and we are going to review
[07:19.040 --> 07:22.560]  a couple of videos that we watched and we'll actually watch a video on the air.
[07:22.560 --> 07:23.560]  Guys, stick around.
[07:23.560 --> 07:24.560]  We're going to take a fat dab.
[07:24.560 --> 07:27.840]  Everybody at the table got super chatty as soon as I decided to turn off the mic.
[07:27.840 --> 07:29.120]  So I'm turning the mics back on.
[07:29.120 --> 07:30.120]  Now they're back on.
[07:30.120 --> 07:31.120]  Okay.
[07:31.120 --> 07:35.000]  I was like, dude, we weren't, we weren't fucking, we were sitting there waiting for you to pay
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.480]  the bills and you know, pay the dues and stuff like that.
[07:37.480 --> 07:39.160]  And you know, all that shit's important.
[07:39.520 --> 07:42.520]  I'm going to take a dab on the show since, uh, since the mics came back on.
[07:42.520 --> 07:45.400]  But no, we, uh, I'm going to give a big shout out while I heat up the nail.
[07:45.400 --> 07:47.640]  Uh, how somebody remind me the name of this place.
[07:47.640 --> 07:48.640]  God, I feel like an asshole.
[07:48.640 --> 07:49.640]  Cause I forgot.
[07:49.640 --> 07:50.640]  I wasn't with you.
[07:50.640 --> 07:53.560]  Higher Elevation Masterpiece Productions in Colorado Springs.
[07:53.560 --> 07:54.740]  I had a broken rig.
[07:54.740 --> 07:55.840]  The joint got broken off.
[07:55.840 --> 07:56.840]  It busted right off.
[07:56.840 --> 08:01.320]  Uh, my email pulled the nail off, pulled the joint right off and busted that shit.
[08:01.320 --> 08:03.960]  And I took it there and they charged me a good price and they fixed it.
[08:03.960 --> 08:06.320]  And this sucker looks brand new, bro.
[08:06.320 --> 08:07.320]  It's beautiful.
[08:07.320 --> 08:08.320]  It looks gorgeous.
[08:08.640 --> 08:09.640]  It hits brand new.
[08:09.640 --> 08:11.200]  They did it in a timely manner.
[08:11.200 --> 08:12.200]  The price was right.
[08:12.200 --> 08:14.080]  And the little chick that works there is super sweet.
[08:14.080 --> 08:15.080]  She's super friendly.
[08:15.080 --> 08:16.280]  I'll go back there when I need a repair.
[08:16.280 --> 08:17.760]  Hopefully I don't ever need a damn repair.
[08:17.760 --> 08:18.760]  I'm going to take a dab.
[08:18.760 --> 08:20.720]  Why don't you guys talk about something chaotic?
[08:20.720 --> 08:24.980]  We, um, we went there and I mean, we were looking, he was looking for a rig, but they
[08:24.980 --> 08:26.800]  had tons of little tiny rigs.
[08:26.800 --> 08:29.680]  I mean, little tiny miniature cakes like his phase two over there.
[08:29.680 --> 08:33.920]  That was, I mean, maybe this big, the smaller shake, you know, for only, you know, there
[08:33.920 --> 08:36.400]  weren't two, three inches off the table.
[08:36.400 --> 08:37.400]  Not even that.
[08:37.480 --> 08:39.360]  It was like three inches, maybe two and a half.
[08:39.360 --> 08:43.800]  But compared to what we have here locally in town, you know, it was, it was definitely
[08:43.800 --> 08:45.600]  a, it had more selection.
[08:45.600 --> 08:50.360]  They just had shit crammed in cases like they barely had room, you know, but there was definitely
[08:50.360 --> 08:53.800]  selection and, uh, anything that you could imagine.
[08:53.800 --> 08:55.440]  So it was definitely a cool place.
[08:55.440 --> 09:01.320]  Uh, met a friendly dude in there that was, you know, he was talkative and he had some,
[09:01.320 --> 09:04.600]  some golden goat or something.
[09:04.600 --> 09:05.600]  Was it goat or was it?
[09:05.600 --> 09:06.600]  Yeah.
[09:06.800 --> 09:07.800]  Oh my gosh.
[09:07.800 --> 09:08.800]  All right.
[09:08.800 --> 09:09.800]  You know, so I have anything to do with the store though.
[09:09.800 --> 09:10.800]  So don't go expecting.
[09:10.800 --> 09:12.140]  Okay, well I didn't know if he had anything.
[09:12.140 --> 09:14.180]  He was just hanging out in there throwing people.
[09:14.180 --> 09:16.340]  It was just a customer trying to be social.
[09:16.340 --> 09:21.100]  I've never known any place that can fix a broken piece before you break a piece.
[09:21.100 --> 09:22.100]  It's gone.
[09:22.100 --> 09:23.100]  Say goodbye, bury that sucker.
[09:23.100 --> 09:25.200]  And this looks brand new people.
[09:25.200 --> 09:26.980]  So you might be able to save it.
[09:26.980 --> 09:29.680]  I don't know if I got a hookup or anything, cause they kind of, I've been in there a little
[09:29.680 --> 09:34.420]  bit, but the price they charged me, I was blown away at how cheap it was.
[09:34.420 --> 09:36.940]  As far as I'm concerned, it's a miracle.
[09:36.940 --> 09:37.780]  They made me drop.
[09:37.780 --> 09:38.960]  I didn't know this was a thing before.
[09:38.960 --> 09:41.300]  They made me drop a deposit on it, which was cheap,
[09:41.300 --> 09:43.260]  but whatever.
[09:43.260 --> 09:45.860]  You pay the deposit to have it repaired, they repair it,
[09:45.860 --> 09:48.060]  and if they break it when it's getting repaired,
[09:48.060 --> 09:51.020]  you get 30% off the rig of your choice in the store.
[09:51.020 --> 09:51.860]  Oh, nice.
[09:51.860 --> 09:52.680]  Yeah.
[09:52.680 --> 09:53.520]  My voice will come back.
[09:53.520 --> 09:54.480]  I sound weird because I just took a dab.
[09:54.480 --> 09:56.820]  I'm all choked up trying to get this dab going for Adam.
[09:56.820 --> 09:59.700]  So it was wider here, correct?
[09:59.700 --> 10:01.060]  And now it's thinner right there?
[10:01.060 --> 10:04.140]  No, it tapered just like that.
[10:04.140 --> 10:06.620]  It looks like they cut it off right at the top of,
[10:06.620 --> 10:09.140]  because I broke it right where the new joint, the line is.
[10:09.140 --> 10:12.180]  I broke it right, the old one broke right there anyway.
[10:12.180 --> 10:13.060]  So they just cleaned it up
[10:13.060 --> 10:14.860]  and put a new one on nice and clean.
[10:15.900 --> 10:16.860]  That one's you.
[10:16.860 --> 10:17.700]  And then I guess that one's you as well.
[10:17.700 --> 10:18.740]  There's a dab for Mike.
[10:18.740 --> 10:20.460]  Mike's gonna cough forever after this,
[10:20.460 --> 10:21.860]  so you guys be prepared.
[10:21.860 --> 10:22.960]  Yeah, sorry, folks.
[10:25.020 --> 10:27.900]  It's really good hash, that, so.
[10:27.900 --> 10:28.740]  Give him a shout out.
[10:28.740 --> 10:29.560]  It's Terpex.
[10:29.560 --> 10:32.740]  Yeah, Terpex, dude, you guys killed it.
[10:32.740 --> 10:36.420]  Gatsby, I shouted you guys out last week and you got it,
[10:36.420 --> 10:40.900]  but we're dabbing some super lemon haze right now.
[10:40.900 --> 10:43.860]  And it's, once it hits the back of your throat,
[10:43.860 --> 10:45.700]  it's definitely lemon.
[10:45.700 --> 10:47.420]  That's like a, this one's my stash.
[10:47.420 --> 10:49.200]  I've had this set aside for a little while.
[10:49.200 --> 10:50.540]  There's a reason.
[10:50.540 --> 10:53.100]  I had some of the sour grapes
[10:53.100 --> 10:57.660]  and it was some of the better shatter that I've tasted here.
[10:57.660 --> 11:02.220]  So big shout out to those guys up there
[11:02.220 --> 11:03.460]  and Springs Rockin' It.
[11:03.460 --> 11:04.300]  Jordan and Jordan.
[11:04.300 --> 11:06.700]  This is why you don't smoke tobacco, people.
[11:06.700 --> 11:08.220]  Yeah, you hear Mike over there trying to die?
[11:08.220 --> 11:09.780]  It's like he needs oxygen.
[11:09.780 --> 11:12.080]  He needs scuba gear just to do a podcast, bro.
[11:13.540 --> 11:15.380]  I'll pull a couple of different coughs.
[11:15.380 --> 11:16.940]  We've all been there.
[11:16.940 --> 11:20.220]  Except for you, who is iron lunged.
[11:20.220 --> 11:21.860]  Well, sometimes, dude, at the end of the day it hurts
[11:21.860 --> 11:23.540]  and I don't, sometimes I have to wait
[11:23.540 --> 11:25.860]  till 7, 10 in the evening to take a good dab.
[11:25.860 --> 11:27.380]  I've seen you cough a couple times.
[11:27.380 --> 11:28.220]  Yeah.
[11:28.220 --> 11:29.380]  It's not every time, but.
[11:29.380 --> 11:31.380]  The gram dab did not make me cough, though.
[11:31.380 --> 11:34.380]  No, you hit that thing for two and a half minutes.
[11:34.380 --> 11:35.980]  I was doing what I do, bro.
[11:35.980 --> 11:38.480]  If you dab much at all or with people at all,
[11:38.480 --> 11:40.100]  you stink quickly.
[11:40.100 --> 11:43.640]  If you smoke tobacco, you dab and then you sound like me.
[11:45.640 --> 11:46.480]  I'm in Mike's boat.
[11:46.480 --> 11:47.580]  If you just consume cannabis.
[11:47.580 --> 11:48.420]  As well.
[11:48.420 --> 11:49.660]  You dab and sound like Jeff.
[11:51.080 --> 11:52.860]  You sound like this on the radio?
[11:52.860 --> 11:53.700]  Yep.
[11:53.700 --> 11:55.940]  You sound like you should be our radio host.
[11:55.940 --> 11:57.460]  That is a face for radio, sir.
[11:57.460 --> 11:59.340]  All right, let's bring this meeting to order.
[11:59.340 --> 12:00.180]  All right.
[12:01.020 --> 12:02.900]  So we talked a little bit about the meeting.
[12:02.900 --> 12:04.860]  Mike was kind enough to show up to the Grow meeting
[12:04.860 --> 12:07.380]  hosted by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies last night.
[12:07.380 --> 12:08.420]  That was awesome.
[12:09.260 --> 12:10.260]  That's funny, I got a text that said,
[12:10.260 --> 12:11.700]  I ate too much and I can't move
[12:11.700 --> 12:13.060]  and they're supposed to bring me food.
[12:13.060 --> 12:15.620]  So I wonder if that means that I'm not getting food.
[12:15.620 --> 12:17.000]  Oh, it's a good time.
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.420]  The food was more mingled than lesson time.
[12:21.420 --> 12:22.260]  Yeah.
[12:22.260 --> 12:24.340]  But I liked that, it was nice.
[12:24.340 --> 12:27.540]  The lesson was, I think, I realized about halfway through
[12:27.540 --> 12:29.780]  that most of us were probably able to do everything
[12:30.380 --> 12:32.580]  that Jesse was teaching, but I'm glad he took that
[12:32.580 --> 12:36.580]  as his first teaching opportunity because he's good now,
[12:36.580 --> 12:39.220]  dude, he's learning and he's catching up.
[12:39.220 --> 12:41.760]  Being on this podcast has really made him a better speaker.
[12:41.760 --> 12:42.960]  So now he's able to do that.
[12:42.960 --> 12:44.380]  I think the next couple of lessons,
[12:44.380 --> 12:45.860]  Jesse's gonna really crush it.
[12:45.860 --> 12:47.220]  I picked a bad spot.
[12:47.220 --> 12:50.400]  Like if I tried to watch Jesse while he was talking,
[12:50.400 --> 12:52.660]  I would have been watching his back.
[12:52.660 --> 12:55.300]  So I was watching everyone else watch Jesse.
[12:55.300 --> 12:59.060]  And I mean, cloning isn't complicated,
[12:59.100 --> 13:01.780]  but he went over all the steps real quick.
[13:01.780 --> 13:05.300]  And at one point, everybody in the room pretty much went,
[13:05.300 --> 13:10.180]  oh yeah, and took a second to pull their phone out
[13:10.180 --> 13:12.120]  or grab a pen and jot down a little note.
[13:12.120 --> 13:15.740]  Like I should use this product or I'm keeping it too wet
[13:15.740 --> 13:17.980]  or too dry or over or under watering,
[13:17.980 --> 13:20.100]  or I mean, just little simple stuff.
[13:20.100 --> 13:23.260]  Yeah, it was definitely the little talk afterward,
[13:23.260 --> 13:24.660]  the fine tuning talk about,
[13:24.660 --> 13:26.740]  oh, you're probably over watering if that's what you're doing
[13:26.740 --> 13:27.700]  you're probably under watering.
[13:27.700 --> 13:28.540]  That's what was cool.
[13:28.980 --> 13:30.540]  That's what was really valuable after that.
[13:30.540 --> 13:31.940]  But dude, Jesse did a really good job.
[13:31.940 --> 13:32.780]  I'm super proud of him.
[13:32.780 --> 13:34.140]  So you listen to the show.
[13:34.140 --> 13:34.980]  Shout out, man.
[13:34.980 --> 13:35.800]  Good job.
[13:35.800 --> 13:36.640]  You did a really good job.
[13:36.640 --> 13:37.480]  We wanted to say that.
[13:37.480 --> 13:39.460]  And also I'm all choked up.
[13:39.460 --> 13:40.660]  Also a huge shout out to Bern.
[13:40.660 --> 13:42.300]  She lets us throw a party back there
[13:42.300 --> 13:43.140]  in the back of the store.
[13:43.140 --> 13:43.980]  That's really cool.
[13:43.980 --> 13:45.220]  That's kind of her store.
[13:45.220 --> 13:46.100]  It's her baby.
[13:46.100 --> 13:47.980]  So thanks for letting us make a mess in your place.
[13:47.980 --> 13:50.540]  You got like 12 dudes hanging out back there.
[13:50.540 --> 13:55.540]  And thank you for the invite to the social gathering there.
[13:55.580 --> 13:56.420]  Yes.
[13:56.420 --> 13:57.260]  Thank you.
[13:57.260 --> 13:58.420]  Yeah, we have a good time there.
[13:59.260 --> 14:00.100]  High grow indoor growing supplies.
[14:00.100 --> 14:01.460]  We'll do that every month
[14:01.460 --> 14:03.080]  and we'll announce the dates on this show.
[14:03.080 --> 14:04.900]  We try to get as many people as we can.
[14:04.900 --> 14:06.820]  Armando, bro, I look forward to you being there.
[14:06.820 --> 14:07.780]  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.
[14:07.780 --> 14:10.620]  Hopefully we can have another one in December.
[14:10.620 --> 14:11.460]  Yep.
[14:11.460 --> 14:12.280]  December is kind of rough for everybody.
[14:12.280 --> 14:13.700]  There's a lot of holidays there
[14:13.700 --> 14:15.140]  for all the different religious groups.
[14:15.140 --> 14:15.980]  You gotta have-
[14:15.980 --> 14:17.820]  They are talking about doing a December event.
[14:17.820 --> 14:21.200]  They brought it up at least twice last night.
[14:21.200 --> 14:22.860]  I just don't remember what the date was.
[14:22.860 --> 14:24.740]  I don't think they've have one nailed down yet.
[14:24.740 --> 14:27.160]  I have a little space, a big space heater.
[14:27.160 --> 14:29.480]  If we decide to do it back there in December
[14:29.480 --> 14:31.320]  because it was a little chilly, bro.
[14:31.320 --> 14:32.160]  It's Colorado.
[14:32.160 --> 14:34.360]  Sometimes chilly is what happens.
[14:34.360 --> 14:39.360]  And if a room is that vapor filled, we'll go with-
[14:39.840 --> 14:40.680]  It was a private party.
[14:40.680 --> 14:41.520]  You gotta open the door.
[14:41.520 --> 14:42.520]  A private party things happen.
[14:42.520 --> 14:44.160]  Yeah, that's why it's invite only, huh?
[14:44.160 --> 14:44.980]  Yes.
[14:44.980 --> 14:45.820]  Yeah, it's-
[14:45.820 --> 14:47.720]  What about, you were saying,
[14:47.720 --> 14:50.200]  the larger area towards the outside of town
[14:50.200 --> 14:53.440]  that maybe you would be able to got at one point in time?
[14:53.440 --> 14:55.480]  Yeah, that's in the future.
[14:55.480 --> 14:57.160]  We're definitely looking at another social club.
[14:57.160 --> 14:59.560]  It'll be a private party thing that will be an invite.
[14:59.560 --> 15:02.600]  Well, I was just thinking for that since it was no heat.
[15:02.600 --> 15:03.980]  It works perfectly so far.
[15:03.980 --> 15:05.320]  We like doing it at the store because then-
[15:05.320 --> 15:06.160]  I'm down.
[15:06.160 --> 15:07.920]  I talk about a product and I can run down the hallway
[15:07.920 --> 15:09.600]  and grab it and be like, this is what it looks like.
[15:09.600 --> 15:12.560]  A whole bunch of people left with stuff, which was awesome.
[15:12.560 --> 15:14.640]  I left, okay, I told this story once,
[15:14.640 --> 15:16.760]  but I'm sitting there, the night's pretty much over.
[15:16.760 --> 15:18.280]  A whole bunch of people left with products
[15:18.280 --> 15:20.320]  that they bought after the grow lesson
[15:20.320 --> 15:21.260]  is what I was going for.
[15:21.260 --> 15:23.040]  But there were a bunch of people that left with stuff
[15:23.040 --> 15:23.880]  like you left with stuff.
[15:24.720 --> 15:25.600]  They give out gifts.
[15:25.600 --> 15:27.760]  They definitely give out prizes and shit for people coming.
[15:27.760 --> 15:30.640]  We're gonna start doing contests and shit also.
[15:30.640 --> 15:31.520]  We're just getting it started.
[15:31.520 --> 15:32.360]  We don't know what we're doing.
[15:32.360 --> 15:33.560]  This isn't our forte.
[15:33.560 --> 15:35.040]  We just decided that it needed to be,
[15:35.040 --> 15:37.400]  Jesse decided, I'm taking credit for nothing.
[15:37.400 --> 15:39.320]  Jesse did all of this.
[15:39.320 --> 15:40.740]  He decided that this needed to happen.
[15:40.740 --> 15:42.640]  So he's learning and I'm helping him learn.
[15:42.640 --> 15:44.520]  They've got a hell of a little shop down there.
[15:44.520 --> 15:45.360]  Yes, they do.
[15:45.360 --> 15:47.280]  Wouldn't you say that you two kind of inspire each other?
[15:47.280 --> 15:48.760]  We completely inspire each other.
[15:48.760 --> 15:50.000]  I've been talking about it on the show.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.980]  Jesse is now kind of officially a part of Irie Genetics.
[15:52.980 --> 15:55.540]  He's breeding seeds that will be available.
[15:55.540 --> 15:57.740]  As far as I think our plan goes,
[15:57.740 --> 15:59.580]  there'll be in Irie Genetics packaging
[15:59.580 --> 16:01.120]  and on the Irie Genetics website.
[16:01.120 --> 16:02.780]  We're just gonna add them to here
[16:02.780 --> 16:04.620]  and I'll give Jesse credit.
[16:04.620 --> 16:05.460]  You know what I mean?
[16:05.460 --> 16:07.460]  Jesse is now breeding, it's not all me,
[16:07.460 --> 16:09.340]  those strains that, there'll be specific strains
[16:09.340 --> 16:10.180]  that he does.
[16:10.180 --> 16:11.020]  Awesome, man.
[16:11.020 --> 16:13.420]  So I'm sitting there at the Hygro meeting.
[16:13.420 --> 16:15.940]  I'm chilling, talking to people just like we do, bullshit.
[16:15.940 --> 16:17.420]  And I'm nice and dabbed out.
[16:17.420 --> 16:20.300]  And Jesse comes up and he slides a NanoLux 1000 watt light,
[16:20.300 --> 16:21.620]  a full kit right in front of me.
[16:21.620 --> 16:22.620]  And he goes, here man, run this
[16:22.620 --> 16:23.980]  and let me know what you think.
[16:23.980 --> 16:25.460]  And I was like, shocked,
[16:25.460 --> 16:27.180]  I think is the only word I can come up with.
[16:27.180 --> 16:29.180]  Christmas doesn't just appear in front of you
[16:29.180 --> 16:33.580]  like on a Friday in November.
[16:33.580 --> 16:35.940]  And it did last night for you and it was fun to watch.
[16:35.940 --> 16:36.760]  Yeah, it was kind of neat.
[16:36.760 --> 16:37.800]  I was confused.
[16:37.800 --> 16:38.640]  Right.
[16:38.640 --> 16:39.780]  Because I'm not used to getting a big,
[16:39.780 --> 16:41.140]  that's a big ass gift to get.
[16:41.140 --> 16:41.980]  That's a nice.
[16:41.980 --> 16:42.980]  Yeah, that was huge.
[16:42.980 --> 16:44.420]  I didn't see it coming.
[16:44.420 --> 16:46.700]  And when I saw Jesse give it to you, I was like, wow.
[16:46.700 --> 16:47.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[16:47.540 --> 16:48.700]  But look at it this way though.
[16:48.740 --> 16:51.900]  In three months when you come back to him, like.
[16:52.820 --> 16:54.540]  Do you do like a trading credit?
[16:54.540 --> 16:56.420]  Can I take, can we take these five
[16:56.420 --> 16:58.460]  and can I get four more of those?
[16:58.460 --> 16:59.440]  You know, like.
[16:59.440 --> 17:00.280]  Yeah, exactly.
[17:00.280 --> 17:01.100]  That'll speak volumes.
[17:01.100 --> 17:01.940]  You know what I'm saying?
[17:01.940 --> 17:04.680]  I'll definitely shout that it's NanoLux is the company.
[17:04.680 --> 17:06.540]  NanoLux and Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies
[17:06.540 --> 17:08.120]  get mad respect from me.
[17:08.120 --> 17:10.020]  Check out my, on Instagram,
[17:10.020 --> 17:12.420]  I post a lot of stuff as iReGenetics.
[17:12.420 --> 17:14.400]  That's me, look there.
[17:14.400 --> 17:16.860]  That light really honestly won't get hung until December.
[17:16.860 --> 17:18.220]  I've got a crop that's growing
[17:18.740 --> 17:19.700]  in the room where that will go.
[17:19.700 --> 17:20.860]  And when that crop finishes,
[17:20.860 --> 17:23.500]  that light will go up and then we'll start under there.
[17:23.500 --> 17:25.500]  And if it kicks as much ass as it appears,
[17:25.500 --> 17:27.300]  if it, you know, as it looks,
[17:27.300 --> 17:30.340]  you'll be in the shop buying three more of them here
[17:30.340 --> 17:31.260]  come March.
[17:31.260 --> 17:33.180]  I'll buy four or five more.
[17:33.180 --> 17:34.460]  My only concern is venting.
[17:34.460 --> 17:36.380]  Those don't match up with my venting style.
[17:36.380 --> 17:37.820]  So I can only run those in the winter.
[17:37.820 --> 17:38.660]  Very true.
[17:38.660 --> 17:40.860]  But I can, you know, if they kick as much ass
[17:40.860 --> 17:43.180]  as people have been saying, I can readjust my rooms.
[17:43.180 --> 17:45.140]  All I have to do is change air conditioning.
[17:45.140 --> 17:47.020]  Right, you just gotta change up a little bit.
[17:47.020 --> 17:48.580]  Couldn't you just shorten the pipes
[17:48.580 --> 17:52.020]  and kind of duct out from the main room from top
[17:52.020 --> 17:54.060]  and filter into the bottom, you know,
[17:54.060 --> 17:56.300]  cool air in, hot air out.
[17:56.300 --> 17:57.900]  But the lights I'm running now are ducted.
[17:57.900 --> 17:59.460]  So the heat from the lights I'm running now
[17:59.460 --> 18:02.300]  doesn't ever make it to the room and those are not ducted.
[18:02.300 --> 18:05.500]  It's the only downside that I'm seeing right now.
[18:05.500 --> 18:06.340]  But in the winter.
[18:06.340 --> 18:08.640]  It's all one unit, which I've never seen before.
[18:08.640 --> 18:11.940]  The ballast and the light is all usually separated.
[18:11.940 --> 18:15.060]  This is all one solid, really well-built unit.
[18:15.060 --> 18:16.340]  At least it looks like it's well built.
[18:16.460 --> 18:18.220]  Much lighter than it looks also.
[18:18.220 --> 18:20.700]  It looks like it's heavy as hell, but it's really light.
[18:20.700 --> 18:21.540]  Nice.
[18:21.540 --> 18:22.360]  Yeah, yeah.
[18:22.360 --> 18:24.620]  All right, so let's do this since we're talking about this.
[18:24.620 --> 18:25.460]  Where did I set that one?
[18:25.460 --> 18:26.500]  All right, here it is.
[18:26.500 --> 18:27.340]  You ready?
[18:27.340 --> 18:28.160]  I'm ready.
[18:28.160 --> 18:29.000]  This podcast is brought to you
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.340]  by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[18:31.340 --> 18:32.180]  That happened.
[18:32.180 --> 18:34.140]  Yeah, that happened just like that.
[18:34.140 --> 18:36.060]  Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations
[18:36.060 --> 18:36.980]  to serve Colorado.
[18:36.980 --> 18:40.540]  Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beach Street
[18:40.540 --> 18:42.540]  or check out the Pueblo location
[18:42.540 --> 18:45.100]  at 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[18:45.100 --> 18:47.360]  Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
[18:47.360 --> 18:50.140]  and a great selection of indoor grow supplies.
[18:50.140 --> 18:52.340]  Hygro, I gotta catch up with myself.
[18:52.340 --> 18:54.820]  Hygro is running a special for the podcast listeners.
[18:54.820 --> 18:55.860]  When you check out at Hygro,
[18:55.860 --> 18:58.280]  tell them you listen to the Hygro Culture Podcast
[18:58.280 --> 19:00.060]  and they will give you commercial pricing
[19:00.060 --> 19:02.340]  on your entire purchase.
[19:02.340 --> 19:03.180]  That's so cool.
[19:03.180 --> 19:04.000]  That's a sweet deal.
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.140]  I was talking about it the other night.
[19:05.140 --> 19:08.040]  I bought a bag of dirt, that bag of dirt
[19:08.040 --> 19:10.720]  that you see part of it on the ground there.
[19:10.720 --> 19:12.580]  That bag of dirt is a $25 bag of dirt.
[19:12.580 --> 19:15.300]  I paid about $17 and some jingles,
[19:15.300 --> 19:18.940]  some change in there for that bag of dirt out the door
[19:18.940 --> 19:20.240]  because I paid commercial pricing.
[19:20.240 --> 19:22.140]  That's a hell of a deal.
[19:22.140 --> 19:25.180]  We pay what the dispensaries pay is what our pricing is.
[19:25.180 --> 19:26.620]  If you use that code,
[19:26.620 --> 19:29.260]  if you tell them I listen to the Hygro Culture Podcast.
[19:29.260 --> 19:30.300]  Pay the same prices.
[19:30.300 --> 19:31.140]  It's a good deal.
[19:31.140 --> 19:31.960]  Yeah.
[19:31.960 --> 19:32.800]  Oh dude, it's helpful.
[19:32.800 --> 19:33.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[19:33.640 --> 19:34.460]  Especially for someone like me.
[19:34.460 --> 19:35.300]  You know what I'm saying?
[19:35.300 --> 19:36.420]  Someone low budget.
[19:36.420 --> 19:37.260]  Yeah.
[19:37.260 --> 19:38.100]  So low budget.
[19:38.100 --> 19:39.380]  Low budget if you're listening.
[19:39.380 --> 19:41.460]  Hey, you could save yourself some money there.
[19:41.460 --> 19:42.300]  It's coupons.
[19:42.460 --> 19:43.300]  Coupons.
[19:44.460 --> 19:45.300]  Some coupons.
[19:45.300 --> 19:47.260]  Speaking of couponing, shout out to Matty.
[19:47.260 --> 19:48.100]  What up Matty?
[19:48.100 --> 19:48.940]  You're the coupon queen.
[19:48.940 --> 19:50.300]  It's good to see you back in action, dude.
[19:50.300 --> 19:51.540]  You looked good last night.
[19:51.540 --> 19:53.340]  Dude, I saw Spence last night.
[19:53.340 --> 19:54.620]  Spence is back in action.
[19:54.620 --> 19:55.820]  Back on his feet.
[19:55.820 --> 19:58.760]  Oh, that dude weighs 140 pounds now.
[19:58.760 --> 20:01.700]  He's about six, he's somewhere between six four and six five
[20:01.700 --> 20:02.900]  depending on who you ask.
[20:02.900 --> 20:04.660]  I never run into people taller than me.
[20:04.660 --> 20:05.500]  He's one of the few.
[20:05.500 --> 20:08.580]  Yeah, and he's 140 pounds, dude.
[20:08.580 --> 20:10.700]  So you guys send him some calories.
[20:10.700 --> 20:13.460]  If you can mentally put calories on my brother Spence,
[20:13.460 --> 20:14.780]  just send them right to him
[20:14.780 --> 20:16.940]  because he needs some help right now.
[20:16.940 --> 20:20.020]  I feel it because pressure's coming in.
[20:20.020 --> 20:23.420]  So wish him luck and glad to see he's back home.
[20:23.420 --> 20:25.260]  That's, mm.
[20:25.260 --> 20:27.620]  Are you wishing him luck for the secret cup?
[20:27.620 --> 20:28.660]  Is that what you're wishing him luck for?
[20:28.660 --> 20:29.820]  That may be what I'm wishing him.
[20:29.820 --> 20:30.820]  He knows what I mean.
[20:30.820 --> 20:32.220]  Well, the secret cup is coming up.
[20:32.220 --> 20:33.060]  It's coming up.
[20:33.060 --> 20:33.900]  It's coming up.
[20:33.900 --> 20:34.720]  The finals.
[20:34.720 --> 20:35.560]  The finals.
[20:35.560 --> 20:36.620]  And I expect that to be-
[20:36.620 --> 20:37.860]  In Las Vegas.
[20:37.860 --> 20:38.820]  You think-
[20:38.820 --> 20:39.660]  No, I don't think.
[20:39.660 --> 20:40.740]  About December 15th-
[20:40.740 --> 20:41.580]  I know-
[20:41.580 --> 20:43.300]  Ish, because that's around when he'll be back, I predict.
[20:43.300 --> 20:44.780]  You know, I'm just guessing, being hypothetical here.
[20:44.780 --> 20:46.100]  But the second week of December,
[20:46.100 --> 20:47.620]  maybe the beginning of the third week of December,
[20:47.620 --> 20:49.100]  you think right here in Mike's chair,
[20:49.100 --> 20:51.980]  you think we'll have the secret cup winner,
[20:51.980 --> 20:53.220]  Garden of Whedon,
[20:53.220 --> 20:54.540]  and his lovely lady Maddie
[20:54.540 --> 20:55.900]  sitting right next to us right here?
[20:55.900 --> 20:57.300]  If you do, can I be in the chair
[20:57.300 --> 20:58.700]  that's behind the dab stuff?
[20:58.700 --> 20:59.540]  You can be sitting-
[20:59.540 --> 21:00.860]  Like, I'll just sit in the corner and be quiet
[21:00.860 --> 21:01.700]  for that show.
[21:01.700 --> 21:02.740]  The chair with no mic?
[21:02.740 --> 21:04.780]  Because there's a chair that sometimes people sit in
[21:04.780 --> 21:05.700]  and there's no mic.
[21:05.700 --> 21:06.900]  The mic sits right here next to me.
[21:06.900 --> 21:08.400]  I could fire this mic up, but-
[21:09.660 --> 21:11.900]  It's got a droopy stand, from what I understand.
[21:11.900 --> 21:14.620]  It does, but I've got a replacement.
[21:14.620 --> 21:15.980]  Sometimes people don't want to be heard
[21:15.980 --> 21:17.380]  and they just sit here and dish out dabs
[21:17.380 --> 21:20.500]  and just sit on the podcast and just watch.
[21:20.500 --> 21:21.460]  And then I'd look them in the eye
[21:21.460 --> 21:22.660]  when I do the intro and stuff
[21:22.660 --> 21:23.980]  and I have someone to talk to.
[21:23.980 --> 21:25.460]  When you hear those lively ass intros,
[21:25.460 --> 21:27.460]  they're all, what's up guys, welcome to another episode.
[21:27.460 --> 21:29.500]  That's because there's someone here to fire me up.
[21:29.500 --> 21:30.340]  Nice.
[21:30.340 --> 21:32.260]  No, Adam's been here for a night.
[21:32.260 --> 21:34.540]  In the podcast world, when you're doing a microphone
[21:34.540 --> 21:37.100]  and you got a voice going and you got the energy,
[21:37.100 --> 21:38.340]  sometimes you fail.
[21:38.340 --> 21:40.220]  There was a night one night when Adam and I sat here
[21:40.220 --> 21:42.140]  for probably 45 minutes just going,
[21:42.140 --> 21:43.600]  so welcome to the fucking show.
[21:43.600 --> 21:45.660]  We are failing miserably with a rhythm
[21:45.660 --> 21:48.220]  and a conversation and a lesson.
[21:48.220 --> 21:49.860]  And you should probably fast forward
[21:49.860 --> 21:50.780]  through the rest of this show
[21:50.780 --> 21:52.580]  because tonight is not our flow.
[21:52.580 --> 21:54.020]  Just skip episode 12.
[21:54.020 --> 21:54.860]  That's kind of how it felt.
[21:54.860 --> 21:57.060]  We pulled it off eventually through the magic of editing
[21:57.060 --> 21:58.160]  and a lot of dabs.
[21:59.540 --> 22:02.180]  And throw some more shatter at the problem.
[22:02.180 --> 22:03.980]  I don't even want to talk about where it went.
[22:03.980 --> 22:06.340]  It just went, it was weird.
[22:06.340 --> 22:07.180]  I've been here for so long.
[22:07.180 --> 22:09.500]  Imaginary characters walked into the room.
[22:09.500 --> 22:11.740]  Let's put it that way on the podcast.
[22:13.900 --> 22:16.220]  Some of us might've been hearing voices.
[22:16.220 --> 22:18.540]  All right, so we've been, this is gonna be,
[22:18.540 --> 22:20.180]  guys, this is gonna be one of those episodes
[22:20.180 --> 22:21.020]  where we just kind of revel.
[22:21.020 --> 22:24.060]  We love you, tweet at us and we'll send you free shit.
[22:24.060 --> 22:25.900]  Wait, Mike said that, so tweet at Mike
[22:25.900 --> 22:27.100]  and he will send you free shit.
[22:27.100 --> 22:28.940]  It's not gonna be good free shit.
[22:28.940 --> 22:31.420]  It could be a big pen, but it'll be some free shit.
[22:31.420 --> 22:33.900]  Here's a pen I'd shoot on at city council one night.
[22:33.900 --> 22:35.580]  Congratulations, thanks for listening.
[22:35.580 --> 22:36.800]  There's something we can go into.
[22:37.440 --> 22:38.280]  What about any of that?
[22:38.280 --> 22:39.200]  Have you heard about any of that?
[22:39.200 --> 22:40.320]  You're the city council guy.
[22:40.320 --> 22:42.320]  All right, so since Adam wants to do it,
[22:42.320 --> 22:43.840]  just run right into it.
[22:43.840 --> 22:45.400]  I'm sorry, I do that.
[22:45.400 --> 22:47.200]  That's what my note's for, so.
[22:47.200 --> 22:50.040]  How much time do you think you can wrap that up
[22:50.040 --> 22:52.080]  in quite quickly and not bore the shit out of him?
[22:52.080 --> 22:54.280]  I condensed everything you need to know
[22:54.280 --> 22:56.000]  into just a little paragraph or two.
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.600]  Guys, this may be local news
[22:57.600 --> 22:59.240]  for most of what we're doing here.
[22:59.240 --> 23:01.800]  This is happening in my town and in my county,
[23:01.800 --> 23:03.900]  so this is very pertinent to me.
[23:03.900 --> 23:05.040]  I'm a grower.
[23:05.880 --> 23:07.120]  I've got a home grow.
[23:07.120 --> 23:09.120]  I grow my personal medicine here in my house.
[23:09.120 --> 23:10.880]  I do some small stuff in my home
[23:10.880 --> 23:12.200]  because that's what we do.
[23:12.200 --> 23:13.360]  It's Colorado.
[23:13.360 --> 23:15.840]  Not everything has to happen in a large facility.
[23:15.840 --> 23:19.840]  I am Mike's medical marijuana provider and his caregiver,
[23:19.840 --> 23:22.960]  so what's happening pertains to Mike.
[23:22.960 --> 23:24.000]  In a very real way.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.920]  They're trying to enforce rules upon me and my grow
[23:26.920 --> 23:31.920]  that will, it's gonna fuck with Mike's medicine supply.
[23:32.520 --> 23:34.200]  I've been trying to find a classier way to say that,
[23:34.240 --> 23:35.760]  but it's gonna hinder my production
[23:35.760 --> 23:37.000]  of Mike's quality medicine,
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.960]  and Mike relies on me for medicine.
[23:38.960 --> 23:40.400]  So Mike is going to city council.
[23:40.400 --> 23:42.020]  I keep cutting you off, but I'm setting you up good.
[23:42.020 --> 23:43.120]  Mike is going to city council
[23:43.120 --> 23:44.660]  to make sure this doesn't happen,
[23:44.660 --> 23:46.200]  so this is super important to me.
[23:46.200 --> 23:47.920]  This shit could happen in your area,
[23:47.920 --> 23:49.800]  and someone's gotta stand up and do what Mike does,
[23:49.800 --> 23:52.000]  so if you're doing that, I give you a huge shout out.
[23:52.000 --> 23:53.480]  I'm gonna turn it over to Mike for a couple minutes.
[23:53.480 --> 23:55.400]  Tell me what you learned at city council recently.
[23:55.400 --> 23:58.320]  All right, so down here in Pueblo, Colorado,
[23:58.320 --> 24:00.360]  they're looking at passing home grow rules
[24:00.360 --> 24:02.100]  in the city and in the county.
[24:02.100 --> 24:03.820]  It's two very separate efforts.
[24:04.440 --> 24:06.500]  You have to go to two very separate meetings
[24:06.500 --> 24:08.860]  to be involved with this process.
[24:08.860 --> 24:12.700]  Right now, the planning and zoning department
[24:12.700 --> 24:15.500]  with the city has finalized their proposal.
[24:15.500 --> 24:18.100]  They're sending that recommendation onto city council.
[24:18.100 --> 24:20.420]  City council will receive it.
[24:20.420 --> 24:23.440]  I expect that to happen at their first meeting in December.
[24:23.440 --> 24:26.620]  That's December 8th, and then their final meeting
[24:26.620 --> 24:29.020]  in December on December 22nd,
[24:30.900 --> 24:32.900]  they'll likely be taking public comment
[24:32.940 --> 24:36.660]  and a vote on these proposed home grow rules
[24:36.660 --> 24:39.880]  that will essentially limit every caregiver in Pueblo.
[24:39.880 --> 24:41.820]  They're really, really ugly rules, folks.
[24:41.820 --> 24:46.820]  You wanna get down to city council on the 22nd
[24:47.420 --> 24:50.100]  and speak out against these rules for sure.
[24:50.100 --> 24:52.500]  They're also, out in the county,
[24:52.500 --> 24:54.620]  that meeting is gonna be taking place
[24:54.620 --> 24:57.000]  on December 10th at 9 a.m.,
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.740]  so that meeting's a little bit closer.
[24:59.740 --> 25:00.620]  Mark your calendars.
[25:00.620 --> 25:02.780]  If you can get down there, check that out.
[25:03.620 --> 25:06.780]  If you're interested in local Pueblo cannabis law news,
[25:06.780 --> 25:10.260]  check out Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[25:10.260 --> 25:13.000]  I'm trying to post this stuff up as fast as I can,
[25:13.000 --> 25:16.260]  but getting digital copies of the ordinances
[25:16.260 --> 25:17.860]  that I can easily post to Facebook
[25:17.860 --> 25:20.780]  has been a little tricky, but info about the meetings
[25:20.780 --> 25:23.100]  and what you can do to help out,
[25:23.100 --> 25:24.500]  that's the best place to look right now
[25:24.500 --> 25:27.140]  if you're looking for that kind of info.
[25:27.140 --> 25:28.740]  And that's essentially it, folks.
[25:28.860 --> 25:33.380]  Um, and this is just mainly on caregivers?
[25:33.380 --> 25:35.020]  It's, the rules are gonna,
[25:35.020 --> 25:38.260]  and the city and the county rules are different.
[25:38.260 --> 25:40.740]  This is an extension of what you already went to.
[25:40.740 --> 25:43.660]  Okay, I'll definitely go, for sure.
[25:43.660 --> 25:45.100]  Anything you need support on, brother.
[25:45.100 --> 25:46.840]  The rules as they stand right now,
[25:46.840 --> 25:48.200]  there's a whole lot of them.
[25:48.200 --> 25:51.060]  They don't make a whole lot of sense.
[25:51.060 --> 25:52.980]  I'm doing a whole bunch of private lobbying
[25:52.980 --> 25:53.820]  trying to stop them.
[25:53.820 --> 25:55.100]  Can you tell me an example of a couple
[25:55.100 --> 25:56.620]  of the stupid rules they're trying to put out?
[25:56.620 --> 25:59.380]  They're banning all CO2 usage
[25:59.380 --> 26:01.260]  in any sort of marijuana grow room,
[26:01.260 --> 26:03.020]  but the way they write that rule,
[26:03.020 --> 26:05.780]  I mean, it's dumb just on its face,
[26:05.780 --> 26:07.740]  but the way it's written would make it illegal
[26:07.740 --> 26:10.180]  to take the soda stream machine I have in my kitchen
[26:10.180 --> 26:12.060]  into a grow room and use it.
[26:12.060 --> 26:14.260]  I think that's a special new crime now.
[26:14.260 --> 26:15.540]  I'm glad you grabbed that one right away.
[26:15.540 --> 26:17.140]  That's a rule that I find ridiculous
[26:17.140 --> 26:20.380]  because there are people, the CO2,
[26:20.380 --> 26:22.740]  he's talking about CO2 for CO2 augmentation.
[26:22.740 --> 26:24.900]  We run CO2 in grow rooms
[26:24.900 --> 26:28.180]  because the CO2 plants would thrive with more CO2
[26:28.180 --> 26:30.460]  than what's naturally available in the atmosphere.
[26:30.460 --> 26:31.300]  In your natural grow,
[26:31.300 --> 26:33.620]  you probably have about three to 500,
[26:33.620 --> 26:37.460]  probably right around 400 particles per million of CO2.
[26:37.460 --> 26:38.860]  If you go to the hydro shop,
[26:39.740 --> 26:42.220]  they'll set you up with a system where you can get about,
[26:42.220 --> 26:44.100]  it would be cool if you could get about 1,200
[26:44.100 --> 26:46.580]  to 1,800 PPMs of CO2 in the room.
[26:46.580 --> 26:48.220]  What that does is your plants breathe that
[26:48.220 --> 26:50.220]  and they grow much more vigorously.
[26:50.220 --> 26:51.860]  You get bigger buds, you get denser buds,
[26:51.860 --> 26:53.300]  you get larger plants,
[26:53.300 --> 26:55.820]  and it makes them grow more quickly.
[26:55.820 --> 26:58.140]  So tomato growers use this.
[26:58.140 --> 27:01.140]  All kinds of indoor plant growers use CO2.
[27:01.140 --> 27:02.460]  Any hydroponic.
[27:02.460 --> 27:04.860]  And all of these rules are written
[27:04.860 --> 27:06.700]  so that they could easily be applied
[27:06.700 --> 27:08.260]  to anybody doing the same thing
[27:08.260 --> 27:10.520]  with something that's not cannabis,
[27:10.520 --> 27:12.100]  but it's all cannabis specific,
[27:12.100 --> 27:13.460]  so they don't make a lot of sense.
[27:13.460 --> 27:15.540]  Hopefully the city council will see
[27:15.540 --> 27:18.180]  how much nonsense this is and kill it
[27:18.180 --> 27:20.580]  and send the whole matter back to planning
[27:20.580 --> 27:22.060]  and zoning for a redo.
[27:22.100 --> 27:24.100]  I just think it's dumb that they pick out CO2
[27:24.100 --> 27:26.240]  because the tomato farmer can go to the hydro shop
[27:26.240 --> 27:27.500]  and buy it and take it to his house
[27:27.500 --> 27:28.340]  and run it in the basement,
[27:28.340 --> 27:30.620]  just like Adam would in his basement grow,
[27:30.620 --> 27:32.860]  just like Mike would in his basement grow.
[27:32.860 --> 27:35.260]  Well, a lot of the rules is someone,
[27:35.260 --> 27:38.260]  they heard something that sounded scary,
[27:38.260 --> 27:41.260]  and so they wrote a rule that says you can't do that.
[27:41.260 --> 27:44.300]  And because they don't know what they're talking about
[27:44.300 --> 27:45.860]  and the research didn't get done,
[27:45.860 --> 27:47.940]  a lot of the rules don't make sense.
[27:47.940 --> 27:49.740]  I've described it to other people
[27:49.740 --> 27:53.540]  as listening to a five-year-old lecture on calculus.
[27:53.540 --> 27:55.340]  It doesn't matter how much homework
[27:55.340 --> 27:57.340]  they did the night before.
[27:57.340 --> 28:00.740]  The lecture will be total nonsense from start to finish,
[28:00.740 --> 28:02.480]  and anyone not throwing rocks
[28:02.480 --> 28:04.160]  is doing so out of being polite.
[28:05.780 --> 28:06.620]  It's just painful to watch.
[28:06.620 --> 28:08.380]  The last time we went,
[28:08.380 --> 28:12.240]  two of the council at least seemed to be,
[28:12.240 --> 28:15.180]  I won't say pro pot, but not against it.
[28:15.180 --> 28:16.660]  Definitely.
[28:16.660 --> 28:19.100]  I wouldn't say anyone on council is pro pot,
[28:19.460 --> 28:21.900]  but there are some that are interested
[28:21.900 --> 28:24.740]  in what legal marijuana can do for the city.
[28:24.740 --> 28:27.180]  You know, there's still the minority of the vote.
[28:27.180 --> 28:28.540]  It's an uphill climb for sure,
[28:28.540 --> 28:31.300]  which is why I keep bringing it up on this podcast,
[28:31.300 --> 28:33.300]  because people need to show up to these meetings
[28:33.300 --> 28:34.500]  and start pitching in.
[28:34.500 --> 28:38.540]  If planning and zoning's work on the marijuana rules
[28:38.540 --> 28:41.340]  is indicative of their work on other rules,
[28:41.340 --> 28:44.740]  that might be an explanation into why nothing works here.
[28:44.740 --> 28:46.740]  It might just be that nobody's paid attention
[28:46.740 --> 28:48.100]  to government for so long
[28:48.700 --> 28:52.620]  that they don't expect to get caught just doing nonsense.
[28:52.620 --> 28:53.980]  A lot of people aren't aware
[28:53.980 --> 28:56.740]  that we can just go to city council and sign up
[28:56.740 --> 28:59.220]  and sit at that little cozy chair with a microphone.
[28:59.220 --> 29:00.420]  Dude, it's cushy.
[29:00.420 --> 29:01.980]  It feels, they make the kind of,
[29:01.980 --> 29:04.020]  it's intimidating if you're not that kind of person,
[29:04.020 --> 29:05.860]  but the first time you go,
[29:05.860 --> 29:07.180]  I feel like I could go now
[29:07.180 --> 29:09.380]  if I had some real business to go deal with,
[29:09.380 --> 29:10.860]  I could go speak there.
[29:10.860 --> 29:12.060]  It's inviting.
[29:12.060 --> 29:12.900]  Anybody can go.
[29:12.900 --> 29:13.820]  You can go.
[29:13.820 --> 29:14.700]  Totally.
[29:14.700 --> 29:16.220]  Right now, Adam looks like a homeless person
[29:16.220 --> 29:17.060]  with headphones on.
[29:17.060 --> 29:17.900]  Absolutely.
[29:18.700 --> 29:20.300]  He's wearing an irie genetics hoodie that could use a wash.
[29:20.300 --> 29:21.140]  Probably.
[29:21.140 --> 29:22.980]  He's got some dreadlocks that are the same as the hoodie.
[29:22.980 --> 29:24.300]  They definitely could use a wash.
[29:24.300 --> 29:25.140]  Definitely.
[29:25.140 --> 29:26.340]  He's got a tore up green t-shirt under there.
[29:26.340 --> 29:27.220]  I can't see his pants,
[29:27.220 --> 29:29.220]  but his shoes are definitely muddy as crap.
[29:29.220 --> 29:30.940]  And with holes in the bottom of them.
[29:30.940 --> 29:33.260]  But dude, you're invited to go talk at city council.
[29:33.260 --> 29:35.180]  You can speak and nobody will judge you.
[29:35.180 --> 29:36.420]  They'll listen to what you have to say.
[29:36.420 --> 29:37.780]  They may judge you.
[29:37.780 --> 29:38.860]  I'm lying.
[29:38.860 --> 29:41.420]  I saw them definitely condescendingly judge one person
[29:41.420 --> 29:43.780]  for a few minutes and it was almost entertaining.
[29:43.780 --> 29:46.300]  But you can go speak and you can say your piece
[29:46.300 --> 29:49.180]  and you get, I think, five full solid minutes.
[29:49.180 --> 29:50.700]  And they six, I believe.
[29:50.700 --> 29:51.740]  During public comment,
[29:51.740 --> 29:54.020]  they give anyone who wants to come and sign up
[29:54.020 --> 29:56.700]  five full minutes to speak on anything they'd like to.
[29:56.700 --> 29:58.060]  And this happens in every city.
[29:58.060 --> 30:00.380]  If you've got a city hall that has city council meetings,
[30:00.380 --> 30:01.820]  you can go and you can,
[30:01.820 --> 30:04.500]  even if it's something that one guy came and talked
[30:04.500 --> 30:06.660]  for six minutes about the bike lane.
[30:06.660 --> 30:07.500]  Right.
[30:07.500 --> 30:08.340]  And it felt-
[30:08.340 --> 30:09.340]  Like how to use them.
[30:09.340 --> 30:10.300]  Yeah, I was gonna say,
[30:10.300 --> 30:12.220]  it felt like he was giving the city council a lesson
[30:12.220 --> 30:13.380]  on how to use bike lanes,
[30:13.380 --> 30:15.100]  but I think he was asking for more funding
[30:15.100 --> 30:17.060]  to create more bike lanes was his goal.
[30:17.060 --> 30:17.900]  Or that-
[30:17.900 --> 30:19.660]  Information on how to use bike lanes.
[30:19.660 --> 30:24.420]  And these meetings are broadcast free to the public
[30:24.420 --> 30:27.020]  on like channel 16 or 17 here locally.
[30:27.020 --> 30:29.060]  And so he's trying to show the city
[30:29.060 --> 30:30.460]  how to use these new bike lanes.
[30:30.460 --> 30:31.300]  I see, okay.
[30:31.300 --> 30:33.540]  And this is just, he found out a free way to get on TV
[30:33.540 --> 30:36.540]  and give a little educational spiel on bike lanes.
[30:36.540 --> 30:37.380]  And he did it.
[30:37.380 --> 30:40.060]  If you guys are against something that's going,
[30:40.060 --> 30:42.460]  or if you need something that isn't happening to happen,
[30:42.700 --> 30:46.060]  if you're not getting some good recycling in your city,
[30:46.060 --> 30:47.020]  go to city council and be like,
[30:47.020 --> 30:48.300]  hey, we've got a lot of trash.
[30:48.300 --> 30:49.700]  We should work on some recycling.
[30:49.700 --> 30:51.380]  If that's your path, do whatever your passion is.
[30:51.380 --> 30:52.780]  Our passion is cannabis.
[30:52.780 --> 30:53.860]  So we're going to city council
[30:53.860 --> 30:55.180]  and we're saying cannabis a lot.
[30:55.180 --> 30:56.700]  There's a young woman who comes down
[30:56.700 --> 30:59.140]  and speaks on roadside memorials all the time.
[30:59.140 --> 31:03.340]  And I mean, half the room's in tears every time she speaks.
[31:03.340 --> 31:04.220]  I'll give you 30 seconds.
[31:04.220 --> 31:07.620]  Are you pro or are you for or against roadside memorials?
[31:07.620 --> 31:08.980]  I honestly don't care.
[31:08.980 --> 31:09.820]  You don't care.
[31:09.820 --> 31:11.940]  Well, that was a quick 30 seconds, Adam.
[31:12.460 --> 31:13.660]  I don't care.
[31:14.820 --> 31:16.380]  Are they trash or are they?
[31:16.380 --> 31:17.220]  Oh no, no, no.
[31:17.220 --> 31:19.180]  And I definitely wouldn't walk by and kick one.
[31:19.180 --> 31:20.500]  You know, I'm not that kind of an asshole,
[31:20.500 --> 31:22.740]  but to me, it's something that,
[31:24.300 --> 31:26.180]  to me, no one's been lost.
[31:26.180 --> 31:29.420]  So it's hard for me to really yearn for that.
[31:29.420 --> 31:30.980]  Every culture has a way they mourn.
[31:30.980 --> 31:32.860]  And just because I don't understand it
[31:32.860 --> 31:33.700]  doesn't mean they shouldn't do it.
[31:33.700 --> 31:36.420]  Pueblo freaking loves the roadside vigil.
[31:36.420 --> 31:38.060]  It's kind of intense.
[31:38.060 --> 31:40.260]  And I don't know, driving around
[31:40.260 --> 31:41.900]  and not being used to roadside memorials,
[31:42.740 --> 31:44.060]  because it's not something you see all the time in Denver,
[31:44.060 --> 31:45.300]  even though people have died
[31:45.300 --> 31:47.660]  on every street corner in Denver too.
[31:47.660 --> 31:49.700]  Somebody's probably dying on a street corner in Denver
[31:49.700 --> 31:50.540]  while we're talking about this.
[31:50.540 --> 31:51.380]  Probably several people.
[31:51.380 --> 31:52.260]  All right, we're going to shift some gears.
[31:52.260 --> 31:53.620]  Hold on, I have one more thing to say.
[31:53.620 --> 31:54.460]  Do it, do it.
[31:54.460 --> 31:56.220]  Mike, thanks for bringing news to the table, by the way.
[31:56.220 --> 31:57.060]  Thanks, Mike.
[31:57.060 --> 31:58.260]  This will have some intelligent news coming up.
[31:58.260 --> 32:01.300]  That's my whole notes, so don't look to me for more info.
[32:01.300 --> 32:03.820]  I've got news too on the internet though.
[32:03.820 --> 32:04.660]  Start locally.
[32:04.660 --> 32:07.180]  Don't expect to vote for our president
[32:07.180 --> 32:08.820]  and he's going to change cannabis laws.
[32:08.820 --> 32:09.660]  He's not going to do it.
[32:09.660 --> 32:10.980]  That's where I was going to go with this.
[32:10.980 --> 32:15.980]  Your city council has to be cannabis, pro cannabis.
[32:17.580 --> 32:21.020]  And then you work from your city council to your mayor
[32:21.020 --> 32:23.300]  and you try to get that dude in office.
[32:23.300 --> 32:24.780]  That's the way Colorado did it.
[32:24.780 --> 32:27.740]  It didn't start, it started in Denver
[32:27.740 --> 32:30.660]  and they decriminalized it and it worked outwards.
[32:30.660 --> 32:33.420]  I mean, this is just what I know from looking outside.
[32:34.660 --> 32:36.900]  Anything political, you definitely start local.
[32:36.900 --> 32:39.180]  That's where you generate your base and your support.
[32:39.180 --> 32:40.340]  And that's what they're talking about
[32:40.740 --> 32:42.460]  when they say grassroots political effort
[32:42.460 --> 32:43.900]  is going door to door and saying,
[32:43.900 --> 32:46.020]  hey stranger, what do you think about cannabis laws
[32:46.020 --> 32:47.500]  or whatever you're passionate about?
[32:47.500 --> 32:48.940]  And there's tons of that here.
[32:48.940 --> 32:50.740]  I mean, a lot of people on a national level,
[32:50.740 --> 32:52.500]  they think of Colorado and they think
[32:52.500 --> 32:55.500]  they've legalized medical marijuana years and years ago.
[32:55.500 --> 32:57.620]  They legalized recreational marijuana.
[32:57.620 --> 33:00.180]  The game's over, it's done, they won.
[33:02.020 --> 33:04.260]  In a very real sense, yes.
[33:04.260 --> 33:07.380]  I was in line on January 1st with Jeff and other people
[33:07.380 --> 33:08.780]  and there was a dance people were doing
[33:08.780 --> 33:09.660]  on the way out of the store
[33:09.700 --> 33:10.700]  that they just couldn't help.
[33:10.700 --> 33:11.540]  I did it.
[33:11.540 --> 33:13.940]  No one struts and dances and shimmies
[33:13.940 --> 33:16.180]  through a parking lot on their way out of Safeway.
[33:16.180 --> 33:18.100]  I used to sell medical cannabis.
[33:18.100 --> 33:19.420]  I remember the shuffle.
[33:19.420 --> 33:22.500]  Mike and I had, Mike was for a few brief days
[33:22.500 --> 33:23.620]  before we got closed down.
[33:23.620 --> 33:24.980]  Mike worked with me.
[33:24.980 --> 33:28.500]  I was Mike's boss at the only medical marijuana center
[33:28.500 --> 33:29.340]  in town.
[33:29.340 --> 33:32.140]  I sold medical cannabis over the counter for months
[33:32.140 --> 33:34.020]  and am well known for that around here.
[33:34.020 --> 33:37.060]  The first time or bliss is just something so fun to watch.
[33:37.180 --> 33:39.660]  I walked out of that dispensary in January 1st
[33:39.660 --> 33:42.540]  after I was the first person to buy recreational cannabis
[33:42.540 --> 33:45.340]  at the Greener Side Dispensary in Pueblo, Colorado.
[33:45.340 --> 33:47.300]  When I walked out, I've said that so many times.
[33:47.300 --> 33:48.420]  When I walked out of that dispensary,
[33:48.420 --> 33:50.260]  I was like, there was a camera guy there
[33:50.260 --> 33:51.940]  and he goes, hey man, we're doing a documentary.
[33:51.940 --> 33:53.860]  Can you tell us, can you say something good
[33:53.860 --> 33:54.700]  when you walk out?
[33:54.700 --> 33:55.540]  I was like, cool, watch this.
[33:55.540 --> 33:57.740]  I went right back in the door and I came back out
[33:57.740 --> 33:59.780]  and I threw my arms up in the air and I yelled just that.
[33:59.780 --> 34:02.060]  I go, my name is Rasta Jeff and I was the first person
[34:02.060 --> 34:04.700]  to buy recreational cannabis at the Greener Side Dispensary
[34:04.700 --> 34:05.740]  in Pueblo, Colorado.
[34:05.860 --> 34:07.420]  And then I screamed, wow.
[34:08.860 --> 34:12.380]  And that guy looked at me like, that was fucking amazing.
[34:12.380 --> 34:14.420]  That was exactly what he needed for his film.
[34:14.420 --> 34:17.540]  So that could be found probably somewhere on the internet.
[34:17.540 --> 34:21.020]  Filmed stuff that they're gonna use every couple of weeks
[34:21.020 --> 34:23.140]  for the next hundred years that day.
[34:23.140 --> 34:24.820]  It's hilarious.
[34:24.820 --> 34:26.420]  All right, I just pulled up, you were talking,
[34:26.420 --> 34:27.380]  reading news.
[34:27.380 --> 34:31.420]  So what I was leading at is once Colorado legalized
[34:31.420 --> 34:34.440]  marijuana, the fight quickly became cities and counties
[34:34.440 --> 34:36.680]  looking for fun ways to ban it again.
[34:36.680 --> 34:41.040]  So yeah, in a very real way we won, but in a very real way
[34:41.040 --> 34:45.120]  now we're making the rules and drafting the path forward.
[34:45.120 --> 34:48.040]  And the whole world's watching Colorado
[34:48.040 --> 34:50.880]  and Pueblo reports our tax numbers first.
[34:50.880 --> 34:54.040]  So in a very real way, our tiny little town.
[34:54.040 --> 34:57.280]  And would you say we get a lot of Texas traffic
[34:57.280 --> 34:59.760]  because we're like the first stop?
[34:59.760 --> 35:02.480]  We get a lot of every kind of traffic.
[35:02.480 --> 35:04.560]  And Pueblo's on the way to the rest of the US
[35:04.560 --> 35:06.680]  from every place south of here.
[35:06.680 --> 35:08.960]  This used to be a stop on the Santa Fe trail.
[35:08.960 --> 35:09.800]  I didn't know that.
[35:09.800 --> 35:10.640]  Major stop, yes.
[35:10.640 --> 35:11.960]  People have been stopping and getting supplies
[35:11.960 --> 35:15.600]  or gas here for a lot longer than any of us have been alive.
[35:15.600 --> 35:17.480]  Come by again. Very true, Dan.
[35:17.480 --> 35:18.800]  Very true, Dan.
[35:18.800 --> 35:19.640]  Awesome.
[35:19.640 --> 35:21.360]  All right, we're gonna, let's do, do you guys,
[35:21.360 --> 35:22.200]  how much time we got?
[35:22.200 --> 35:23.040]  Fun thing.
[35:23.040 --> 35:23.860]  We've only got a couple things.
[35:23.860 --> 35:25.360]  I'm gonna see how long we've been into this.
[35:25.360 --> 35:26.960]  We're 35 minutes in.
[35:26.960 --> 35:27.800]  Holy crap.
[35:27.800 --> 35:30.000]  Let me read a news article.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.140]  Let me read a news article.
[35:32.800 --> 35:33.660]  Mike's always bringing the good news,
[35:33.660 --> 35:35.220]  but I just read news from the cannabis.
[35:35.220 --> 35:36.860]  This one's by Ricardo Baca.
[35:36.860 --> 35:38.060]  This one's kind of a neat article.
[35:38.060 --> 35:42.260]  This shows, to me, this shows that things are evolving
[35:42.260 --> 35:46.260]  and that America is starting to make changes.
[35:46.260 --> 35:47.380]  That's what I got from it.
[35:47.380 --> 35:49.500]  So it said positive changes.
[35:49.500 --> 35:52.100]  It says marijuana activists are already planning
[35:52.100 --> 35:55.260]  the 2016 campaign to regulate and legalize the sale
[35:55.260 --> 35:58.340]  for recreational pot in Nevada, home to Las Vegas,
[35:58.340 --> 36:01.660]  one of the world's biggest tourism destinations.
[36:02.180 --> 36:03.540]  But some tourists won't have to wait that long
[36:03.540 --> 36:05.300]  to legally buy weed in Las Vegas,
[36:05.300 --> 36:09.500]  thanks to the most legal reciprocity law in the US.
[36:09.500 --> 36:10.620]  I nailed that word, huh?
[36:10.620 --> 36:11.460]  Fucking A.
[36:11.460 --> 36:12.300]  Almost.
[36:12.300 --> 36:13.120]  You're so close.
[36:13.120 --> 36:13.960]  Reciprocity.
[36:13.960 --> 36:14.800]  You're way close.
[36:14.800 --> 36:15.620]  We practiced this beforehand.
[36:15.620 --> 36:16.460]  It's a tricky word.
[36:16.460 --> 36:17.300]  God damn it.
[36:17.300 --> 36:18.120]  Words are hard.
[36:19.340 --> 36:22.180]  I didn't know what it was, so I had to define it.
[36:22.180 --> 36:23.140]  I just didn't know how to say it.
[36:23.140 --> 36:24.140]  I could read it like a champ.
[36:24.140 --> 36:26.180]  I was like, my tongue is mad at that word.
[36:26.180 --> 36:27.180]  It's reciprocity, homie.
[36:27.180 --> 36:28.720]  All right, well, Mike just said it for me,
[36:28.720 --> 36:29.980]  so I'm just gonna point at Mike
[36:30.020 --> 36:32.100]  and he'll say that word every time it comes up from now on.
[36:32.100 --> 36:32.940]  Awesome.
[36:32.940 --> 36:34.820]  Medical marijuana card holders throughout the US
[36:34.820 --> 36:38.680]  will be able to purchase pot in Nevada starting in 2015.
[36:39.620 --> 36:40.700]  All they'll have to do is show
[36:40.700 --> 36:42.260]  their medical marijuana license,
[36:42.260 --> 36:44.740]  show a government ID proving they're 21 or older,
[36:44.740 --> 36:47.760]  and sign an affidavit, and they'll have access to that shop,
[36:47.760 --> 36:50.300]  but no others for their stay in Nevada.
[36:50.300 --> 36:52.940]  Does that lead me to believe they only get one stop
[36:52.940 --> 36:53.900]  when they go to Nevada?
[36:53.900 --> 36:57.140]  That sounds like you gotta pick it and stick it, homie.
[36:57.140 --> 36:58.940]  Pick one and stay with it.
[36:58.980 --> 37:00.580]  But how much are you allowed to?
[37:01.580 --> 37:02.420]  Let me read further.
[37:02.420 --> 37:03.940]  Interesting, so they're trying to prevent smurfing.
[37:03.940 --> 37:06.060]  That's an odd way to do that, but okay.
[37:06.060 --> 37:07.460]  There you go.
[37:07.460 --> 37:11.420]  Will this liberal medical reciprocity?
[37:11.420 --> 37:13.580]  I was wondering what the point was gonna look like.
[37:13.580 --> 37:17.380]  Yeah, I just came across the word reciprocity act
[37:17.380 --> 37:21.320]  as a soft lead to recreational measures in Nevada,
[37:21.320 --> 37:22.620]  and will Nevada pass full-on
[37:22.620 --> 37:25.340]  recreational legalization in 2016?
[37:25.340 --> 37:28.060]  Of course it will, said Jim Lamoureux,
[37:28.060 --> 37:29.440]  who handles government relations
[37:29.440 --> 37:31.980]  at Colorado-based pot testing facility Cannlabs,
[37:31.980 --> 37:33.860]  which recently announced its future present
[37:33.860 --> 37:36.160]  in Nevada's marijuana market.
[37:36.160 --> 37:38.540]  Most people are factoring into their models.
[37:39.660 --> 37:41.220]  Oh, he must not be able to say the word either
[37:41.220 --> 37:42.620]  because he skipped it in his sentence,
[37:42.620 --> 37:44.540]  and they put it in there in parentheses.
[37:44.540 --> 37:46.140]  That's nice, he can't say the word either.
[37:46.140 --> 37:46.980]  Nice, we're in the same boat.
[37:46.980 --> 37:47.820]  It's a tricky one.
[37:47.820 --> 37:48.740]  No, you're not alone there, buddy.
[37:48.740 --> 37:50.340]  All the applications that went in,
[37:50.340 --> 37:52.900]  people discussed it as part of their model.
[37:52.900 --> 37:54.460]  You can consider that Nevada has fewer
[37:54.460 --> 37:56.500]  than 7,000 medical marijuana patients.
[37:56.500 --> 37:58.020]  It's not a very large base,
[37:58.860 --> 38:00.420]  but when you factor in MMJ patients from other states
[38:00.420 --> 38:02.660]  who might take advantage of Nevada's system,
[38:02.660 --> 38:05.380]  another 110,000 from Colorado,
[38:05.380 --> 38:09.860]  570,000 from California, and 100,000 from Washington,
[38:09.860 --> 38:12.600]  suddenly those numbers are looking a lot better.
[38:14.100 --> 38:16.700]  Not to mention if Missouri goes legal this year,
[38:16.700 --> 38:18.420]  which they're talking about 2016.
[38:18.420 --> 38:20.340]  Michigan, Alaska, Michigan.
[38:20.340 --> 38:21.820]  There's several other medical marijuana states.
[38:21.820 --> 38:24.020]  California's gonna be trying to do
[38:24.020 --> 38:25.500]  legalization this year as well.
[38:25.500 --> 38:26.660]  What happened, Florida?
[38:27.500 --> 38:30.620]  Florida, 58% is a pretty good number.
[38:30.620 --> 38:32.020]  Womp, womp, womp.
[38:32.020 --> 38:32.940]  Did we or did we not?
[38:32.940 --> 38:35.020]  No, it sucks for those people that are sick
[38:35.020 --> 38:35.860]  and they need it.
[38:35.860 --> 38:38.380]  But did we or did we not talk about this?
[38:38.380 --> 38:41.180]  Like you thought it, I don't trust Florida's government
[38:41.180 --> 38:45.300]  to give them, say, oh, okay, here's a full medical bill.
[38:45.300 --> 38:46.980]  You can't do anything with it.
[38:46.980 --> 38:48.820]  Nothing can come in, nothing can go out.
[38:48.820 --> 38:51.660]  It's gotta be all CBD here in Florida
[38:51.660 --> 38:53.740]  because we just got such banging medicine
[38:53.740 --> 38:55.020]  like New Jersey does.
[38:55.980 --> 39:00.820]  You were part of that kind of argument in the beginning
[39:00.820 --> 39:02.860]  and I stuck with it, dude.
[39:02.860 --> 39:04.900]  And I'm sorry, man.
[39:04.900 --> 39:05.740]  I still-
[39:05.740 --> 39:06.580]  Florida's having all kinds of issues.
[39:06.580 --> 39:08.820]  They had CBD only legislation
[39:08.820 --> 39:10.900]  before this recent medical marijuana failure
[39:10.900 --> 39:13.140]  and right after the medical marijuana amendment failed,
[39:13.140 --> 39:15.500]  the judge tossed their CBD rules.
[39:15.500 --> 39:17.820]  So they're back to square fucked.
[39:17.820 --> 39:18.720]  Sorry, kids.
[39:19.780 --> 39:20.940]  All right, so this article says,
[39:20.940 --> 39:23.460]  giving patients the ability to legally access
[39:23.500 --> 39:25.380]  medical marijuana when they're visiting
[39:25.380 --> 39:27.980]  a legal medical marijuana state just makes sense,
[39:27.980 --> 39:29.500]  said Taylor West, deputy director
[39:29.500 --> 39:32.020]  of the National Cannabis Industry Association
[39:32.020 --> 39:34.860]  and National Trade Group for Legal Marijuana Businesses.
[39:34.860 --> 39:36.460]  And it makes even more sense when you're talking
[39:36.460 --> 39:38.380]  about a state that has such a huge number
[39:38.380 --> 39:40.300]  of out-of-state visitors.
[39:40.300 --> 39:42.620]  It's safer for patients and good
[39:42.620 --> 39:45.200]  for Nevada businesses, win-win.
[39:47.060 --> 39:49.140]  That would almost be like Florida.
[39:49.140 --> 39:51.260]  Like if you went medical
[39:51.260 --> 39:54.060]  and would allow other states to come in.
[39:54.060 --> 39:56.620]  That dispensary right by Disney World would crush.
[39:57.780 --> 39:59.180]  I mean, that's been the two downsides
[39:59.180 --> 40:00.900]  to medical marijuana from the beginning
[40:00.900 --> 40:04.660]  is it's technically illegal and you can't travel.
[40:04.660 --> 40:06.140]  I mean, if you're good in Colorado,
[40:06.140 --> 40:07.220]  you're not good anywhere else.
[40:07.220 --> 40:08.220]  If you're good in Washington,
[40:08.220 --> 40:09.620]  you're not good anywhere else.
[40:09.620 --> 40:10.460]  Yeah, it's good.
[40:10.460 --> 40:11.660]  And now there's some reciprocity
[40:11.660 --> 40:12.580]  and that's a beautiful thing.
[40:12.580 --> 40:13.980]  You'll see me in Vegas now.
[40:13.980 --> 40:15.980]  And I mean, now look at all the events.
[40:17.940 --> 40:20.380]  Secret Cup's gonna be way bigger in 2015.
[40:20.380 --> 40:22.220]  That's all I'm saying.
[40:22.220 --> 40:24.860]  No, 500 tickets max.
[40:24.860 --> 40:26.540]  Keep it small, nice and private.
[40:26.540 --> 40:28.700]  I agree with that sentiment,
[40:28.700 --> 40:31.660]  but I'd be impressed if they keep it to 500 tickets.
[40:31.660 --> 40:32.660]  Yeah, it's hard to.
[40:32.660 --> 40:33.580]  All right, so check this out.
[40:33.580 --> 40:34.420]  The article goes on.
[40:34.420 --> 40:35.260]  It says, sure enough,
[40:35.260 --> 40:37.460]  Vegas sees roughly 40 million visitors annually.
[40:37.460 --> 40:38.620]  That's a lot of people.
[40:38.620 --> 40:39.620]  But how many of those tourists
[40:39.620 --> 40:41.380]  will have valid medical marijuana cards
[40:41.380 --> 40:42.960]  and how many of those patients will take the time
[40:42.960 --> 40:45.020]  to seek legal Nevada weed?
[40:45.020 --> 40:48.220]  We're still talking relatively small numbers,
[40:48.220 --> 40:50.060]  said Joe Hodes, chief marketing officer
[40:50.740 --> 40:51.620]  at the Denver-based marijuana company,
[40:51.620 --> 40:55.500]  Eddie, sorry, I read that way too quickly, Dixie Elixirs.
[40:55.500 --> 40:58.820]  It's not as if the average tourist or consumer
[40:58.820 --> 41:00.460]  can show up and make a purchase.
[41:00.460 --> 41:01.700]  The Red Card Act won't have,
[41:01.700 --> 41:02.540]  hey, that's what they're calling it,
[41:02.540 --> 41:05.060]  won't have a huge impact on their tourism
[41:05.060 --> 41:06.500]  because it's a small number of people,
[41:06.500 --> 41:09.340]  many of whom were probably already going to Vegas.
[41:09.340 --> 41:10.580]  It might be a convenience,
[41:10.580 --> 41:11.700]  but if I have a red card,
[41:11.700 --> 41:14.780]  I can already get my medicine in my own state.
[41:14.780 --> 41:16.740]  And flying with it can be sketchy sometimes.
[41:16.740 --> 41:18.340]  Yeah, you can get it in your own state.
[41:18.340 --> 41:20.140]  You just can't take it with you to Vegas
[41:20.140 --> 41:21.700]  because you've got to fly there
[41:21.700 --> 41:24.660]  or drive through Utah or New Mexico to get there.
[41:24.660 --> 41:25.900]  Well, now it sounds like you're legit.
[41:25.900 --> 41:26.740]  So when you get there, you can have it.
[41:26.740 --> 41:30.900]  Because what happens when it becomes under pressure?
[41:30.900 --> 41:32.100]  It like explodes or something?
[41:32.100 --> 41:32.940]  No, no, you're cool.
[41:32.940 --> 41:34.820]  I won't go to Utah with friends that love weed.
[41:34.820 --> 41:36.900]  Is this the TSA telling us no?
[41:36.900 --> 41:37.740]  Yeah.
[41:37.740 --> 41:38.560]  Oh, okay.
[41:38.560 --> 41:39.780]  So everybody else can change their policies
[41:39.780 --> 41:41.900]  except for the people that transport everybody, right?
[41:41.900 --> 41:42.740]  Pretty much.
[41:42.740 --> 41:43.560]  Oh, okay.
[41:43.560 --> 41:44.400]  All right, so it says,
[41:44.400 --> 41:45.780]  if Nevada does pass recreational marijuana measures
[41:45.780 --> 41:49.900]  in the 2016 election,
[41:49.900 --> 41:52.300]  the earliest the state will see those sales starting
[41:52.300 --> 41:55.980]  is late 2017, but 2018 is more likely.
[41:55.980 --> 41:57.900]  Until then, companies such as Dixie,
[41:57.900 --> 41:59.280]  which hopes to soon have an agreement
[41:59.280 --> 42:02.300]  allowing the sale of its cannabis-infused edibles,
[42:02.300 --> 42:04.100]  drinks, and topicals in Nevada
[42:04.100 --> 42:07.780]  will have time to leave their mark on the Las Vegas Strip.
[42:07.780 --> 42:09.300]  I was going to ask why two years,
[42:09.300 --> 42:13.620]  but after seeing what just happened in Washington
[42:13.620 --> 42:16.060]  where they're so unprepared for recreational,
[42:16.060 --> 42:18.780]  I would almost expect two years to be right about right.
[42:18.780 --> 42:20.420]  Yeah, give them time to grow some herb,
[42:20.420 --> 42:21.420]  get the rules in place,
[42:21.420 --> 42:22.780]  the guild of dispensary.
[42:22.780 --> 42:25.420]  Get a couple things in stock and like cure it.
[42:25.420 --> 42:26.420]  And it'd be-
[42:26.420 --> 42:27.260]  This rule makes-
[42:27.260 --> 42:28.740]  Wait, that's a funny joke.
[42:28.740 --> 42:31.340]  You think the dispensary is going to cure some weed?
[42:31.340 --> 42:32.380]  You're a funny guy.
[42:32.380 --> 42:33.220]  Har, har, har.
[42:33.220 --> 42:34.780]  Har, har, harvested.
[42:34.780 --> 42:35.700]  Durka, durka.
[42:35.700 --> 42:36.540]  All right.
[42:36.540 --> 42:37.380]  Durka, durka.
[42:37.380 --> 42:38.740]  So we didn't review either the film we watched-
[42:38.740 --> 42:40.960]  That's where we're headed right now.
[42:40.960 --> 42:41.940]  The next thing is,
[42:41.940 --> 42:43.220]  so guys, we'd bragged about,
[42:43.220 --> 42:44.940]  Adam and I bragged recently,
[42:44.940 --> 42:47.180]  about a couple of months ago about going to see Joe Rogan.
[42:47.180 --> 42:48.380]  I ain't shut up about it.
[42:48.380 --> 42:51.020]  So now that I've seen the special,
[42:51.020 --> 42:52.620]  I can see why you didn't shut up about it.
[42:52.620 --> 42:53.460]  I wish I was there.
[42:53.460 --> 42:54.300]  Yeah, we saw Joe,
[42:54.300 --> 42:56.940]  Angela, myself and Adam went and saw Joe Rogan
[42:56.940 --> 42:58.360]  live at the Denver Comedy Works
[42:58.360 --> 43:01.460]  during the taping of his new special that aired last night.
[43:01.460 --> 43:02.700]  And I DVR'd it.
[43:02.700 --> 43:05.340]  Mike came over here and watched it with Angela and I.
[43:05.340 --> 43:07.860]  Adam watched it at his place with his kind lady.
[43:09.020 --> 43:11.740]  That was a funny damn comedy special.
[43:12.500 --> 43:13.340]  They cut out a lot.
[43:13.340 --> 43:14.160]  We were there.
[43:14.160 --> 43:15.000]  They cut out a lot.
[43:15.000 --> 43:16.780]  That's what you guys were saying last night.
[43:16.780 --> 43:19.700]  I liked the final product they put together.
[43:19.700 --> 43:20.740]  I was really,
[43:20.740 --> 43:24.080]  I wish I had that quality of a video camera.
[43:24.080 --> 43:25.900]  The cameras were tiny.
[43:25.900 --> 43:27.540]  The camera that Rogan is staring into
[43:27.540 --> 43:28.560]  the majority of the time,
[43:28.560 --> 43:30.820]  I'm sitting under like a lot of the time.
[43:30.820 --> 43:32.140]  It's a small little thing,
[43:32.140 --> 43:36.500]  like a LED screen display basically.
[43:36.500 --> 43:37.340]  And that's it.
[43:37.340 --> 43:39.420]  So it's cool.
[43:39.420 --> 43:40.660]  It was a great comedy show.
[43:40.660 --> 43:42.900]  He crushed it from beginning to end.
[43:42.900 --> 43:43.740]  My first.
[43:43.740 --> 43:44.980]  Yeah, I was laughing hard last night.
[43:44.980 --> 43:46.700]  Professional one, I would say.
[43:46.700 --> 43:49.820]  And that was a good one to go to for sure.
[43:51.620 --> 43:53.660]  You hadn't gone to another show at Comedy Works before that?
[43:53.660 --> 43:55.340]  I've never been to a professional comedy show
[43:55.340 --> 43:59.020]  like somebody TV-wise, like big time.
[43:59.020 --> 44:00.180]  I mean, I've done stuff here
[44:00.180 --> 44:01.740]  and I mean, it's basically the same,
[44:01.740 --> 44:03.700]  but there was a lot more rules to that.
[44:03.700 --> 44:04.540]  I mean, that was a comedy special.
[44:04.540 --> 44:05.940]  Oh, the taping was intense.
[44:05.940 --> 44:08.420]  Yeah, and there were so many crowd rules.
[44:08.420 --> 44:09.620]  They were moving the crowd around
[44:09.620 --> 44:10.940]  and putting ugly people in the back
[44:10.940 --> 44:12.020]  and sexy people up front.
[44:12.020 --> 44:13.220]  And of course we were under camera,
[44:13.220 --> 44:14.420]  so you couldn't even see us.
[44:14.420 --> 44:15.260]  It was sort of pointless.
[44:15.260 --> 44:17.140]  I never saw a real good look at anybody.
[44:17.140 --> 44:18.540]  You could see where I was headed with this.
[44:18.540 --> 44:19.540]  It was really dark.
[44:19.540 --> 44:21.900]  The only lights in the building were on the stage
[44:21.900 --> 44:22.940]  and you couldn't even see the crowd.
[44:22.940 --> 44:24.740]  So all the moving around and all the rules
[44:24.740 --> 44:28.140]  and the no hats and no logo shit was just too much tension.
[44:28.140 --> 44:30.380]  Or it might've applied if he had a 20 minute bit
[44:30.380 --> 44:32.540]  on like picking on people in the front row or some shit.
[44:32.540 --> 44:36.860]  But all I saw was the profile of one kid a couple of times.
[44:36.860 --> 44:38.580]  And that's pretty much all the crowd you see.
[44:38.580 --> 44:40.540]  That's where we were for Doug Benson.
[44:40.540 --> 44:41.380]  Yeah.
[44:41.380 --> 44:42.220]  That's what I kept telling him.
[44:42.220 --> 44:43.940]  Yeah, there are three seats off to the side up on the top.
[44:43.940 --> 44:44.780]  And that's where.
[44:44.780 --> 44:45.620]  Nice.
[44:45.620 --> 44:46.460]  Yeah.
[44:46.460 --> 44:47.300]  And see right next to Jeff,
[44:47.300 --> 44:49.420]  Jeff was basically underneath the camera.
[44:49.420 --> 44:50.980]  There was a guy sitting next to us,
[44:50.980 --> 44:54.300]  but it was still wheelchair accessible.
[44:54.300 --> 44:56.380]  So it wasn't sloped.
[44:56.380 --> 44:59.500]  So he was up higher so that every shot from across the way,
[44:59.500 --> 45:01.860]  it basically blocked us like completely out of there
[45:01.860 --> 45:05.460]  because we were underneath his shoulders basically.
[45:05.460 --> 45:07.180]  Probably down to his elbow.
[45:07.180 --> 45:08.020]  Yeah, I know.
[45:08.420 --> 45:09.260]  That's the easiest way to get on TV.
[45:09.260 --> 45:10.220]  Just go to city council.
[45:10.220 --> 45:13.780]  They give you five minutes to talk live on television.
[45:13.780 --> 45:16.780]  Joe Rogan doesn't have to catch you in the side view.
[45:16.780 --> 45:17.620]  That's funny.
[45:17.620 --> 45:18.460]  Great show.
[45:18.460 --> 45:19.300]  Great show.
[45:19.300 --> 45:20.300]  Go be on TV for free.
[45:20.300 --> 45:21.140]  All right.
[45:21.140 --> 45:22.740]  So speaking of Joe Rogan being on a video,
[45:22.740 --> 45:23.580]  shout out to Joe Rogan.
[45:23.580 --> 45:24.420]  That show was great.
[45:24.420 --> 45:25.740]  Shout out to Comedy Works.
[45:25.740 --> 45:27.460]  Big respect to Melissa.
[45:27.460 --> 45:28.860]  If you guys don't know Melissa at Comedy Works,
[45:28.860 --> 45:30.780]  then you don't know what you're missing.
[45:31.900 --> 45:32.740]  Let's see.
[45:32.740 --> 45:33.700]  What else am I gonna say?
[45:33.700 --> 45:36.140]  We watched a culture high tonight.
[45:36.140 --> 45:37.700]  I invited these dudes over.
[45:38.380 --> 45:39.580]  I rented it from iTunes,
[45:39.580 --> 45:41.580]  which I've never rented anything from iTunes.
[45:41.580 --> 45:43.780]  It feels kind of weird to pay 4.99
[45:43.780 --> 45:47.060]  to watch something for 24 hours on my computer.
[45:47.060 --> 45:48.180]  But okay, I get it.
[45:48.180 --> 45:49.300]  I'm glad you did it.
[45:49.300 --> 45:51.220]  Me too, it was worth my 4.99.
[45:53.180 --> 45:54.060]  I learned a lot of stuff.
[45:54.060 --> 45:55.420]  I tried to take some notes.
[45:56.260 --> 45:58.540]  We came to a really easy conclusion.
[45:58.540 --> 46:00.060]  Fuck Nancy Grace.
[46:00.060 --> 46:01.100]  Fuck Nancy Grace.
[46:01.100 --> 46:02.740]  I can't believe I haven't said that yet.
[46:02.740 --> 46:05.180]  That's the only fucking thing I wrote down.
[46:05.180 --> 46:06.020]  That's it.
[46:06.060 --> 46:06.900]  I fucking failed.
[46:06.900 --> 46:07.740]  You showed up and Jeff beat him to it.
[46:07.740 --> 46:09.180]  Yeah, you fucking.
[46:09.180 --> 46:12.540]  Well I thought, I'm sorry, you want me to hit pause?
[46:12.540 --> 46:13.980]  No, no, no, no.
[46:13.980 --> 46:15.940]  You might just have to bleep out a name, that's all.
[46:15.940 --> 46:16.780]  Go ahead.
[46:16.780 --> 46:17.620]  No, I'm sorry.
[46:17.620 --> 46:18.460]  Dude.
[46:20.940 --> 46:21.780]  Do you wanna say it with me?
[46:21.780 --> 46:22.620]  No, okay.
[46:22.620 --> 46:25.180]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[46:25.180 --> 46:27.020]  It deserves to be said as a group.
[46:27.020 --> 46:28.740]  I'm sorry, but anyway, fuck Nancy Grace.
[46:28.740 --> 46:29.860]  Yeah, fuck Nancy Grace.
[46:29.860 --> 46:32.340]  Everyone should check out the culture high.
[46:32.340 --> 46:33.300]  It's worth a watch.
[46:33.300 --> 46:35.660]  Sit your parents down, have them watch it with you.
[46:36.300 --> 46:38.580]  Watch it as a family, watch it with your friends.
[46:38.580 --> 46:39.420]  It's worth it.
[46:39.420 --> 46:40.260]  You'll learn a lot.
[46:40.260 --> 46:43.100]  Give it to someone that's maybe not open-minded,
[46:43.100 --> 46:44.940]  but willing to listen.
[46:44.940 --> 46:46.700]  That's all.
[46:46.700 --> 46:47.540]  Willing.
[46:47.540 --> 46:49.540]  Who's one of your favorite speakers in there?
[46:49.540 --> 46:50.580]  I did write down a name.
[46:50.580 --> 46:51.420]  I forget him.
[46:51.420 --> 46:53.100]  He was towards the end, Howard Bloom.
[46:53.100 --> 46:53.940]  He gets crazy.
[46:53.940 --> 46:56.780]  He gets all old man-ish and shit.
[46:56.780 --> 46:58.780]  You know, like his jowl start.
[46:58.780 --> 46:59.620]  That's funny.
[46:59.620 --> 47:00.460]  It is, dude.
[47:00.460 --> 47:02.060]  But his message is true.
[47:02.060 --> 47:03.980]  So it's there.
[47:04.020 --> 47:05.860]  Who's your favorite in the show, Mike?
[47:05.860 --> 47:07.140]  It's a toss up.
[47:07.140 --> 47:09.700]  I'm a huge fan of Judge James Gray.
[47:09.700 --> 47:11.740]  I'm a huge fan of Dr. Lester Greenspoon.
[47:11.740 --> 47:15.140]  And they're both heavy narrators in the beginning.
[47:15.140 --> 47:17.940]  Ed Burns, the guy that did The Wire is-
[47:17.940 --> 47:19.780]  Ed Burns is one of my faves.
[47:19.780 --> 47:22.940]  Talking, Dr. Lester Greenspoon wrote
[47:22.940 --> 47:26.020]  life-changing books on cannabis.
[47:26.020 --> 47:28.700]  He's one of the, like the researchers.
[47:28.700 --> 47:30.900]  I mean, Harvard trained, works at Harvard,
[47:30.900 --> 47:34.940]  researching cannabis for the last, what, 50 years?
[47:34.940 --> 47:35.980]  How many?
[47:35.980 --> 47:38.420]  I mean, just incredible, incredible speakers
[47:38.420 --> 47:40.020]  to have gathered for this documentary.
[47:40.020 --> 47:41.060]  I loved it.
[47:41.060 --> 47:42.220]  I know I keep interrupting.
[47:42.220 --> 47:43.060]  No, go ahead.
[47:43.060 --> 47:43.900]  You got a question.
[47:43.900 --> 47:48.780]  How many years do you think like he worked for,
[47:48.780 --> 47:51.740]  he's like ex-D-I-D-A.
[47:51.740 --> 47:52.580]  Which one?
[47:52.580 --> 47:54.140]  The, you just said-
[47:54.140 --> 47:54.980]  Ed Burns.
[47:54.980 --> 47:56.340]  Ed Burns.
[47:56.340 --> 47:59.380]  He was, I can't remember which law enforcement agency.
[47:59.420 --> 48:01.300]  He was a cop for a whole bunch of,
[48:01.300 --> 48:04.740]  he was a murder detective for a whole bunch of years
[48:04.740 --> 48:06.300]  in Baltimore, I believe.
[48:06.300 --> 48:07.140]  Yeah.
[48:07.140 --> 48:08.660]  Those dudes always have some stories, man.
[48:08.660 --> 48:10.940]  Like every time, like, and it's,
[48:10.940 --> 48:15.020]  we have more of them that come over to our side
[48:15.020 --> 48:17.460]  than they, than, you know, like the druggies clean up
[48:17.460 --> 48:19.060]  and go to the cops because for number one-
[48:19.060 --> 48:21.380]  Law enforcement against prohibition's an awesome group.
[48:21.380 --> 48:25.780]  That's full, made up fully of ex-judges, cops, detectives,
[48:25.780 --> 48:28.620]  D-A agents that just saw that prohibition
[48:28.660 --> 48:30.700]  doesn't do anything but harm.
[48:31.780 --> 48:33.980]  And it might come from an interesting place
[48:33.980 --> 48:35.540]  of trying to prevent drug use,
[48:35.540 --> 48:37.340]  but it doesn't do that at all.
[48:37.340 --> 48:40.940]  And on top of not being effective at all at its main goal,
[48:40.940 --> 48:43.020]  it's also incredibly harmful to the society
[48:43.020 --> 48:44.340]  it's attempting to try to.
[48:44.340 --> 48:47.820]  I'm, I can, I can agree with that.
[48:47.820 --> 48:50.020]  I'd also had clips from Joe Rogan.
[48:50.020 --> 48:51.420]  We saw Snoop Dizzle.
[48:51.420 --> 48:53.540]  We saw Lester Grinspoon.
[48:53.540 --> 48:54.540]  Brian Redman was in there.
[48:54.540 --> 48:55.900]  A lot of people might not know who that is,
[48:55.900 --> 48:58.260]  but I know who he is and shout out to Brian Redman.
[48:58.900 --> 49:00.140]  D.Rill was in there.
[49:00.140 --> 49:01.860]  They also, they proved-
[49:01.860 --> 49:02.700]  Mr. Nice.
[49:02.700 --> 49:04.900]  I was gonna say who was your favorite, but I'm-
[49:04.900 --> 49:05.740]  All of the above.
[49:05.740 --> 49:06.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[49:06.580 --> 49:07.900]  There was just, I got attachments to all of them
[49:07.900 --> 49:09.260]  because, you know, just industry things.
[49:09.260 --> 49:11.180]  I look up to a lot of those people.
[49:11.180 --> 49:12.220]  They actually show that cannabis,
[49:12.220 --> 49:13.660]  scientifically they prove that cannabis
[49:13.660 --> 49:16.180]  does not cause schizophrenia.
[49:16.180 --> 49:17.020]  They reminded me-
[49:17.020 --> 49:18.460]  They talk a lot about that research in the beginning.
[49:18.460 --> 49:20.100]  I loved that lead in.
[49:20.100 --> 49:22.460]  Cannabis was outlawed in 1937.
[49:22.460 --> 49:26.660]  And they actually mentioned that alcohol poisoning
[49:26.700 --> 49:30.660]  causes 250,000 deaths per year.
[49:30.660 --> 49:32.100]  Did you catch the tobacco numbers?
[49:32.100 --> 49:33.420]  No. 500,000?
[49:33.420 --> 49:36.340]  They compare it to the Holocaust every year.
[49:36.340 --> 49:37.180]  Yeah, they did.
[49:37.180 --> 49:38.700]  Okay, you're right.
[49:38.700 --> 49:40.820]  A Holocaust around the planet every year
[49:40.820 --> 49:42.140]  due to tobacco consumption.
[49:42.140 --> 49:44.940]  Of not just the Jewish people,
[49:44.940 --> 49:47.300]  but also of the German soldiers that died as well.
[49:47.300 --> 49:49.020]  I don't remember how they broke it down,
[49:49.020 --> 49:50.420]  but it's like five and a half million people
[49:50.420 --> 49:52.900]  around the globe die every year due to tobacco consumption.
[49:52.900 --> 49:54.740]  And it's just crazy.
[49:54.740 --> 49:56.180]  And zero from cannabis.
[49:57.180 --> 50:00.340]  The US is held up as a model around the world
[50:00.340 --> 50:03.220]  is the place that has pushed tobacco consumption
[50:03.220 --> 50:07.100]  down to record levels with education.
[50:07.100 --> 50:10.740]  That's really all we did is we check ID at the point of sale
[50:10.740 --> 50:14.940]  and we tell every school kid, if you smoke tobacco,
[50:14.940 --> 50:16.860]  it will lead to these health effects.
[50:16.860 --> 50:20.140]  And we give them the legitimate information on tobacco.
[50:20.140 --> 50:21.820]  And that's all we did.
[50:22.460 --> 50:26.860]  And they made a few catchy kind of teenager commercials.
[50:26.860 --> 50:29.580]  I mean, they threw a couple of million dollars every year
[50:29.580 --> 50:31.980]  at like crazy teen smoking ads and stuff.
[50:31.980 --> 50:34.180]  But like the really effective stuff
[50:34.180 --> 50:35.980]  is just sitting the kid down in health class
[50:35.980 --> 50:37.820]  and being like, this is your nice pink lung.
[50:37.820 --> 50:39.300]  This is the black lung.
[50:39.300 --> 50:40.660]  I remember those videos.
[50:40.660 --> 50:42.460]  You know what, my kids, we're running out of time.
[50:42.460 --> 50:44.500]  I want to do a couple of things before we have to wrap it up.
[50:44.500 --> 50:45.540]  Hi, grandmas.
[50:45.540 --> 50:46.540]  Yes, exactly.
[50:46.540 --> 50:47.860]  That's what's next.
[50:47.860 --> 50:49.940]  I was stumbling across the internet and everywhere I go,
[50:49.940 --> 50:53.060]  there's videos of grandmas smoking weed for the first time.
[50:53.060 --> 50:54.820]  Do you think I can play it with sound and not get in trouble
[50:54.820 --> 50:56.580]  or should I just cut the sound out of it?
[50:56.580 --> 50:59.020]  We might want, I mean, honestly, for legal reasons,
[50:59.020 --> 51:00.100]  you might want to hit pause, I think,
[51:00.100 --> 51:01.460]  just so you don't have to worry about it.
[51:01.460 --> 51:03.580]  I'll watch it and I'll just keep the volume to where
[51:03.580 --> 51:05.620]  we can't hear it so it doesn't go to the recording.
[51:05.620 --> 51:07.820]  All right, everybody bring it up real quick.
[51:07.820 --> 51:09.060]  Yeah, go ahead and type in right now,
[51:09.060 --> 51:11.980]  search for grandmas smoking weed for the first time.
[51:11.980 --> 51:13.940]  I'll give you a second to search for that.
[51:13.940 --> 51:15.740]  Yes, that one with the three nice grandmas in the bong.
[51:15.740 --> 51:17.700]  Yeah, it's three ladies, pink and purple.
[51:17.700 --> 51:19.100]  The three old ladies wearing pink and purple
[51:19.100 --> 51:20.460]  and they got a purple bong in front of them.
[51:20.460 --> 51:21.820]  That's the video you're searching for.
[51:21.820 --> 51:23.180]  Don't get any weird parody.
[51:23.180 --> 51:24.420]  I'm going to hit play right now
[51:24.420 --> 51:25.340]  and then I'm going to talk about it.
[51:25.340 --> 51:26.580]  If you guys need a minute to catch up,
[51:26.580 --> 51:27.700]  I'll give you a second.
[51:27.700 --> 51:30.660]  And then I'm going to hit play on three, two, one, play.
[51:31.740 --> 51:33.340]  YouTube's loading, I'm sorry, I failed.
[51:33.340 --> 51:35.940]  Oh, okay, it starts off with an old lady taking a bong,
[51:35.940 --> 51:37.780]  taking a bong hit, starts off with another old lady taking,
[51:37.780 --> 51:39.540]  they don't clear it, they just fill it
[51:39.540 --> 51:40.700]  and then they leave it all smoky.
[51:40.700 --> 51:41.540]  But it looks stylish.
[51:41.540 --> 51:42.740]  The first timers don't judge them too much.
[51:42.740 --> 51:45.060]  Yeah, I'm just, well, you know, I'm trying to narrate here.
[51:45.100 --> 51:46.180]  It's a six minute video.
[51:46.180 --> 51:47.620]  I don't know if we'll get through all of it.
[51:47.620 --> 51:49.220]  Oh, okay, not six minutes probably,
[51:49.220 --> 51:50.380]  but we'll talk through a lot of it.
[51:50.380 --> 51:52.260]  Grandma smoking weed for the first time.
[51:52.260 --> 51:54.260]  It's a very well produced video.
[51:54.260 --> 51:55.500]  They had a nice camera too.
[51:55.500 --> 51:58.020]  I'm going to tease the sound quality because I'm curious.
[51:58.020 --> 52:00.260]  And we had our cigarettes and our cocktails
[52:00.260 --> 52:01.460]  and we were happy.
[52:01.460 --> 52:03.220]  No, I've never smoked marijuana before.
[52:03.220 --> 52:05.180]  You want to listen to it, dude.
[52:05.180 --> 52:06.940]  Crank it up and just enjoy it.
[52:06.940 --> 52:08.580]  No, I'll watch it when I can one time,
[52:08.580 --> 52:10.220]  but I don't want to get us in trouble.
[52:10.220 --> 52:11.900]  Because it's the quotes that are beautiful
[52:11.900 --> 52:14.820]  when the vaporizer gets sat down on the table.
[52:15.580 --> 52:16.420]  Let me jump in here.
[52:16.420 --> 52:17.940]  This dude is about to light the bong
[52:17.940 --> 52:20.100]  for this nice looking old lady.
[52:20.100 --> 52:21.620]  She pulled it closer to her face.
[52:21.620 --> 52:23.980]  He's showing her what's about to happen.
[52:23.980 --> 52:25.540]  She's shaking the lighter because it won't work.
[52:25.540 --> 52:27.020]  She keeps shaking it when she tries to light it.
[52:27.020 --> 52:27.940]  So now she's toking, bro.
[52:27.940 --> 52:28.980]  She's pulling a toke.
[52:28.980 --> 52:30.140]  She did not carve it.
[52:30.140 --> 52:31.700]  No, none of them carve it.
[52:31.700 --> 52:33.580]  They weren't instructed to as well.
[52:33.580 --> 52:36.020]  They were instructed to do everything till then.
[52:37.020 --> 52:38.180]  Oh, this one old lady.
[52:39.420 --> 52:41.220]  I'd say she's probably the older of the three.
[52:41.220 --> 52:43.020]  She just took a pretty nice bong rip.
[52:43.060 --> 52:45.260]  They start ripping in here in a second.
[52:45.260 --> 52:46.100]  It's awesome.
[52:46.100 --> 52:47.740]  She's definitely smoked like a hookah before.
[52:47.740 --> 52:49.740]  Oh, she goes back for seconds.
[52:49.740 --> 52:50.900]  And then the Betty White looking chick
[52:50.900 --> 52:53.580]  is about to line up for a dab or for a bong rip.
[52:53.580 --> 52:56.380]  I really hope they had some nice munchies after this video.
[52:56.380 --> 52:57.900]  I was laughing so hard the first time I saw it.
[52:57.900 --> 52:59.820]  Oh, that's a lot of smoke coming out of there.
[52:59.820 --> 53:02.020]  What it said in the beginning was they gave them snacks
[53:02.020 --> 53:04.620]  and they gave them drinks and they gave them pot
[53:04.620 --> 53:07.180]  or cannabis and went with it, you know?
[53:07.180 --> 53:08.380]  So it's all good.
[53:08.380 --> 53:10.500]  I don't want to get myself taken off of fucking iTunes,
[53:10.500 --> 53:11.780]  but I'm going to put some of the volume in
[53:12.380 --> 53:13.220]  one minute later.
[53:13.220 --> 53:14.060]  So here, we want to listen to this.
[53:14.060 --> 53:16.300]  I think it was easier than I thought.
[53:16.300 --> 53:17.140]  Yeah.
[53:17.140 --> 53:17.980]  Yeah.
[53:17.980 --> 53:25.480]  And I think it was better to do the cigarette, the joint.
[53:25.480 --> 53:26.320]  All right, that's enough.
[53:26.320 --> 53:27.160]  I don't want to get myself in trouble,
[53:27.160 --> 53:28.400]  but all right, five minutes later.
[53:28.400 --> 53:29.360]  So I'm just going to let it play.
[53:29.360 --> 53:31.360]  And then it's a long video.
[53:31.360 --> 53:32.200]  So we'll put some clips in.
[53:32.200 --> 53:33.520]  They're starting to feel it now.
[53:33.520 --> 53:35.160]  I can go ahead and tell you basically from memory.
[53:35.160 --> 53:36.480]  They're starting to feel it now.
[53:36.480 --> 53:39.320]  Okay, just three grandmas getting super high
[53:39.320 --> 53:40.160]  for the first time.
[53:40.160 --> 53:41.000]  It's hilarious.
[53:41.000 --> 53:41.840]  Yeah, they're playing Jenga.
[53:41.840 --> 53:43.680]  And then she starts playing with it with her second hand.
[53:43.680 --> 53:45.760]  And the other chick's like, no, you can't.
[53:45.760 --> 53:46.600]  You're not supposed to play with two hands.
[53:46.600 --> 53:47.760]  Oh, and there it goes.
[53:47.760 --> 53:49.400]  She couldn't even do it with two hands.
[53:49.400 --> 53:51.720]  So 15 minutes later, we'll turn it up for a second.
[53:51.720 --> 53:53.120]  Oh, they pull out a vaporizer.
[53:53.120 --> 53:57.100]  It's going through my mind.
[53:57.100 --> 53:57.940]  Leave it out.
[53:57.940 --> 53:59.260]  It kind of looks like a sex toy.
[54:04.750 --> 54:07.750]  No, but I've never seen anything on the end of it like this.
[54:09.150 --> 54:10.750]  It's the vaporizer that's been produced.
[54:10.750 --> 54:14.270]  Looks like a dildo with a straw coming out of the tube.
[54:14.270 --> 54:15.350]  And now she's toking it.
[54:15.350 --> 54:16.630]  She's actually hitting it.
[54:16.630 --> 54:17.470]  Yeah.
[54:17.470 --> 54:18.310]  So I'm going to jump in a couple of minutes
[54:18.310 --> 54:19.350]  because I don't want to watch these old ladies
[54:20.150 --> 54:20.990]  instead of vaporizing.
[54:20.990 --> 54:22.030]  It's the quotes that they say throughout this
[54:22.030 --> 54:24.910]  that make it an insanely popular video.
[54:24.910 --> 54:25.750]  Oh, they're high now.
[54:25.750 --> 54:26.590]  I can see it on their faces.
[54:26.590 --> 54:28.830]  The middle old lady's eyes are just blasted red.
[54:28.830 --> 54:31.310]  35 minutes later, we'll give you some volume.
[54:31.310 --> 54:34.430]  Broadway this season blank the music.
[54:34.430 --> 54:35.710]  Oh, they're just playing card games.
[54:35.710 --> 54:38.790]  Okay, so it'd be the South or Queefy.
[54:41.190 --> 54:42.030]  What's Queefy?
[54:43.150 --> 54:43.990]  Cleffery.
[54:43.990 --> 54:44.830]  Cleffery.
[54:44.830 --> 54:46.310]  Well, there's no R.
[54:46.310 --> 54:47.150]  Cleffy.
[54:47.150 --> 54:47.990]  Cleffy.
[54:48.110 --> 54:49.830]  Anybody know what cleffing is?
[54:49.830 --> 54:52.310]  Q-U-E-E-F-I-N-G.
[54:52.310 --> 54:53.150]  Queefy.
[54:53.150 --> 54:54.070]  Yeah, anybody know what that really is?
[54:54.070 --> 54:55.750]  It's a very modern word.
[54:55.750 --> 54:58.670]  Is it, are there other terminology?
[54:58.670 --> 54:59.510]  Is there more terminology?
[54:59.510 --> 55:00.790]  This is three stoned grandmas
[55:00.790 --> 55:02.870]  about to learn what queefing means.
[55:02.870 --> 55:03.870]  Oh, okay.
[55:03.870 --> 55:05.470]  Fooling around a lot.
[55:05.470 --> 55:06.830]  The guy says, since you're cool,
[55:06.830 --> 55:08.190]  I'll go ahead and tell you.
[55:08.190 --> 55:10.270]  Then it just shows the definition
[55:10.270 --> 55:11.750]  and one of them is vaginal farting.
[55:11.750 --> 55:12.590]  I'll turn it back up
[55:12.590 --> 55:13.430]  because you want to hear the reaction.
[55:13.430 --> 55:14.270]  Oh, let's do that one.
[55:14.270 --> 55:15.430]  Oh, they didn't show it.
[55:15.430 --> 55:16.270]  I'm just worried that-
[55:16.270 --> 55:17.110]  No, that's what they said.
[55:17.110 --> 55:17.950]  Let's do that one.
[55:17.950 --> 55:18.790]  Do it.
[55:18.790 --> 55:19.830]  The answer is something like
[55:19.830 --> 55:21.230]  pussy farts in a musical.
[55:21.230 --> 55:22.070]  It just-
[55:22.070 --> 55:23.270]  I'm just worried that we're going to get in trouble
[55:23.270 --> 55:24.590]  for playing too much of this video,
[55:24.590 --> 55:25.710]  but it's on the cannabis
[55:25.710 --> 55:26.950]  and I feel like we should be able to play it.
[55:26.950 --> 55:28.590]  But yeah, because this shit's funny.
[55:28.590 --> 55:29.430]  They're high.
[55:29.430 --> 55:30.270]  You can tell they're visibly high,
[55:30.270 --> 55:31.230]  but nothing goes wrong.
[55:31.230 --> 55:32.310]  These are all ladies that,
[55:32.310 --> 55:34.030]  one's got like a damn sweater.
[55:34.030 --> 55:35.390]  I don't know, it's a shawl maybe,
[55:35.390 --> 55:37.830]  but it looks like a fucking blanket wrapped around her.
[55:37.830 --> 55:39.430]  That lady's got a scarf.
[55:39.430 --> 55:43.070]  These look like lunch ladies.
[55:43.070 --> 55:45.350]  It's videos like this that take all the scary
[55:45.390 --> 55:47.830]  out of cannabis consumption.
[55:47.830 --> 55:49.590]  And there at the end,
[55:49.590 --> 55:51.150]  the main purpose of the story.
[55:51.150 --> 55:53.070]  I mean, do we want to spoil that for everybody?
[55:53.070 --> 55:53.910]  Or do we want them to watch-
[55:53.910 --> 55:55.070]  No, go and watch this one.
[55:55.070 --> 55:55.910]  Go search for this.
[55:55.910 --> 55:56.750]  It's going to be worth your while.
[55:56.750 --> 55:58.030]  It's six minutes long.
[55:58.030 --> 55:59.310]  We're not going to do the whole thing on the show
[55:59.310 --> 56:00.350]  because we're running out of time.
[56:00.350 --> 56:01.190]  I don't even think it's that.
[56:01.190 --> 56:02.030]  I think five.
[56:02.030 --> 56:02.870]  I think you guys would approve.
[56:02.870 --> 56:03.870]  It's funny.
[56:03.870 --> 56:05.430]  What else did I want to do on the show?
[56:05.430 --> 56:06.790]  Send it to your grandma.
[56:06.790 --> 56:08.830]  Send it to your grandma.
[56:08.830 --> 56:10.670]  I don't know about all that.
[56:10.670 --> 56:11.630]  That'd be weird.
[56:11.630 --> 56:12.470]  Send it to your grandma.
[56:12.470 --> 56:13.310]  Whatever show her in that.
[56:13.310 --> 56:14.150]  Send it to your grandma.
[56:14.350 --> 56:15.190]  No, it'd be a problem.
[56:15.190 --> 56:16.030]  Grandma already saw it.
[56:16.030 --> 56:16.870]  She's on Facebook.
[56:16.870 --> 56:17.710]  It's creepy.
[56:17.710 --> 56:18.630]  It's creepy.
[56:18.630 --> 56:20.070]  All right, let's start wrapping up the show, you guys.
[56:20.070 --> 56:21.870]  We've gotten just about an hour here.
[56:22.790 --> 56:24.510]  I approve of the movie, A Culture High.
[56:24.510 --> 56:26.310]  I think the Joe Rogan show kicked ass.
[56:26.310 --> 56:28.950]  I think this grandma smoking weed video was pretty awesome.
[56:28.950 --> 56:30.830]  If you don't have some stuff to watch on TV,
[56:30.830 --> 56:32.270]  if you're bored, pull up your phone,
[56:32.270 --> 56:33.790]  pull up your computer and watch those things.
[56:33.790 --> 56:35.030]  It'll be worth your time.
[56:36.150 --> 56:38.950]  My Instagram on iRegenetics is getting close
[56:38.950 --> 56:40.990]  to 10,000 followers.
[56:40.990 --> 56:42.790]  The end of this video says no grandmas were harmed
[56:42.790 --> 56:43.710]  in the making of this video,
[56:44.270 --> 56:45.110]  which I think is clever.
[56:45.110 --> 56:45.950]  That's good.
[56:45.950 --> 56:46.790]  Damn.
[56:46.790 --> 56:49.070]  My Instagram is at 10,000 followers.
[56:49.070 --> 56:51.470]  If I'm at 9,400 and something,
[56:51.470 --> 56:53.230]  if I could get you guys to follow
[56:53.230 --> 56:55.630]  and get me up to 10,000, that'd be super awesome.
[56:55.630 --> 56:57.910]  It's at iRegenetics on Instagram.
[56:57.910 --> 56:59.310]  I don't ask you guys to do a lot of things.
[56:59.310 --> 57:01.030]  That's all I'm asking for today.
[57:01.030 --> 57:01.950]  Adam, you got any plugs?
[57:01.950 --> 57:03.230]  Anything you want people to follow?
[57:03.230 --> 57:04.270]  Any shout outs?
[57:04.270 --> 57:07.470]  Overgrowth, the gov, Twitter, Instagram, things like that.
[57:08.430 --> 57:09.470]  Big shout out to Bender.
[57:09.470 --> 57:12.190]  Sitting at home, working on the server while I'm here,
[57:12.190 --> 57:13.030]  having fun.
[57:13.550 --> 57:14.390]  That's it, man.
[57:14.390 --> 57:18.150]  And local, like Mike is fixing to probably say,
[57:18.150 --> 57:19.510]  local stuff.
[57:19.510 --> 57:20.550]  Get out and do it.
[57:20.550 --> 57:22.110]  Yep, local shout out stuff.
[57:22.110 --> 57:23.190]  Well, I was gonna say,
[57:23.190 --> 57:25.230]  check out the Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws
[57:25.230 --> 57:26.950]  Facebook page if you're interested
[57:26.950 --> 57:29.630]  in Pueblo local cannabis news.
[57:29.630 --> 57:32.990]  And check me out on Twitter, NemoPunk15.
[57:32.990 --> 57:33.830]  Follow him, guys.
[57:33.830 --> 57:34.670]  Support him.
[57:34.670 --> 57:35.510]  Do you have an Instagram?
[57:35.510 --> 57:36.350]  I do it.
[57:36.350 --> 57:37.190]  I don't Instagram.
[57:37.190 --> 57:38.430]  I don't take pictures of anything but my dogs.
[57:38.430 --> 57:41.110]  And I feel like people have seen other people's dogs.
[57:41.150 --> 57:43.070]  Do they poop in weird places?
[57:43.070 --> 57:44.950]  Oh, totally.
[57:44.950 --> 57:46.630]  I've got two females and a male.
[57:46.630 --> 57:47.470]  You might have an Instagram.
[57:47.470 --> 57:49.230]  The male's got some poop issues.
[57:49.230 --> 57:51.070]  Vigor Lover Grows Mids.
[57:51.070 --> 57:52.790]  I just thought I'd put that out there.
[57:52.790 --> 57:55.030]  Vigor Lover Grows Mids.
[57:55.030 --> 57:57.710]  If you want some irigenetic seeds,
[57:57.710 --> 58:00.710]  pay attention to naturesgreenremedies.com in December.
[58:00.710 --> 58:02.390]  I'll get them out there as soon as I can.
[58:02.390 --> 58:03.910]  As soon as I get them packaged up,
[58:03.910 --> 58:06.310]  I will get them to Nature's Green Remedies.
[58:06.310 --> 58:08.150]  You'll get hooked up.
[58:08.150 --> 58:09.710]  I'm gonna start doing that part
[58:09.710 --> 58:11.390]  where we close out the show.
[58:11.390 --> 58:13.990]  If I can find the proper paper, it goes like this, guys.
[58:13.990 --> 58:16.630]  But pay attention, because there's more to the end here.
[58:16.630 --> 58:17.470]  Now that the show's over,
[58:17.470 --> 58:19.070]  please go to iTunes or Stitcher.
[58:19.070 --> 58:20.990]  Go to the iTunes store or the Stitcher main page
[58:20.990 --> 58:22.190]  and search for iGrow Culture.
[58:22.190 --> 58:23.110]  Find the review section.
[58:23.110 --> 58:25.070]  Give us a five-star rating.
[58:25.070 --> 58:25.910]  Five stars, dude.
[58:25.910 --> 58:27.390]  We're five stars, right?
[58:27.390 --> 58:28.230]  Absolutely.
[58:29.790 --> 58:30.630]  I love you guys.
[58:30.630 --> 58:32.070]  And I always try to give you a five-star rating
[58:32.070 --> 58:34.070]  on Stitcher when I listen.
[58:34.070 --> 58:35.510]  Nice, thank you.
[58:35.510 --> 58:38.430]  I'll give you guys a five-star rating if you give us one.
[58:38.550 --> 58:40.510]  No, really, tell us what you really think, though.
[58:40.510 --> 58:42.030]  Give us a rating that you feel like we deserve.
[58:42.030 --> 58:43.350]  I feel like we got good sound quality.
[58:43.350 --> 58:44.390]  We got pretty good content.
[58:44.390 --> 58:46.710]  We try to stay on topic, but we are high.
[58:46.710 --> 58:48.870]  Tonight was a little spasticky,
[58:48.870 --> 58:50.470]  but I think we pulled it back together.
[58:50.470 --> 58:52.150]  We'll be back with better episodes in the future.
[58:52.150 --> 58:54.030]  We've got Organic As Fuck coming,
[58:54.030 --> 58:55.790]  and then we've got the nutrients for Adam.
[58:55.790 --> 58:58.230]  Jesse bailed with the main topic.
[58:58.230 --> 58:59.390]  Well, I don't wanna throw it all at Jesse.
[58:59.390 --> 59:00.230]  It wasn't a bail.
[59:00.230 --> 59:01.070]  Like, that wasn't.
[59:01.070 --> 59:02.070]  He did a hell of a good job yesterday.
[59:02.070 --> 59:03.190]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[59:03.190 --> 59:04.870]  I thought we were blaming Jesse.
[59:04.870 --> 59:06.310]  You guys did team up on that earlier.
[59:06.310 --> 59:08.070]  We did agree to blame Jesse, so.
[59:08.670 --> 59:09.510]  People are already back on that.
[59:09.510 --> 59:12.190]  This awesomeness was Jesse's doing.
[59:12.190 --> 59:13.310]  Hashtag blame Jesse.
[59:13.310 --> 59:15.430]  Don't forget that every episode of this podcast
[59:15.430 --> 59:17.430]  is available, or no, this podcast is available
[59:17.430 --> 59:20.150]  on iTunes, Stitcher, and every episode is archived

[59:39.790 --> 59:42.630]  to sponsor or send me a product.
[59:42.630 --> 59:43.870]  We still need our own theme song.
[59:43.870 --> 59:46.190]  I wanna give a shout out to Coot Dog from The Mystic Roots.
[59:46.190 --> 59:47.350]  He helped us out with a lot of music.
[59:47.350 --> 59:48.670]  But if you wanna make a theme song
[59:48.670 --> 59:50.710]  that says iGrow Culture hosted by Rasta Jeff
[59:50.710 --> 59:52.990]  or something like that, I would really super duper
[59:52.990 --> 59:53.830]  appreciate that.
[59:53.830 --> 59:55.990]  We'd give you mad credit, maybe send you an iReed T-shirt
[59:55.990 --> 59:58.830]  or whatever I've got laying around that works for ya.
[59:58.830 --> 01:00:00.470]  I wanna give a huge shout out to Angela
[01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:01.950]  and her perfect vagina.
[01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:03.630]  Shout out to my ninja Spence.
[01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:04.710]  Thanks again for listening to you guys.
[01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:06.310]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:08.630]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:09.470]  Wow.
