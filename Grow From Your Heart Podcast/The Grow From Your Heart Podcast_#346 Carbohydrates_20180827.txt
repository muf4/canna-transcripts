[00:08.960 --> 00:11.320]  Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11.320 --> 00:14.760]  It's time for episode 346 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:14.760 --> 00:18.440]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:18.440 --> 00:19.800]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:19.800 --> 00:21.160]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:21.160 --> 00:23.580]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:23.580 --> 00:25.360]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:25.360 --> 00:27.880]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:27.880 --> 00:30.880]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:30.880 --> 00:33.280]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:33.280 --> 00:35.360]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:35.360 --> 00:37.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the show
[00:37.040 --> 00:38.160]  is brought to you by my friends
[00:38.160 --> 00:39.960]  at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:39.960 --> 00:43.120]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden,
[00:43.120 --> 00:45.640]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company
[00:45.640 --> 00:49.160]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:49.160 --> 00:52.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers,
[00:52.240 --> 00:55.160]  roll up a fat spliff, put some fresh water in the bong,
[00:55.160 --> 00:56.840]  or start heating up that dab nail
[00:56.840 --> 00:58.660]  because it's time for a fresh episode
[00:58.660 --> 01:00.520]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:02.840 --> 01:03.680]  What's up, everybody?
[01:03.680 --> 01:05.040]  Welcome to episode 346.
[01:05.040 --> 01:06.000]  Thanks for joining me.
[01:06.000 --> 01:07.200]  You know I like to start the show off
[01:07.200 --> 01:09.960]  by letting you know what I am smoking today.
[01:09.960 --> 01:12.520]  I'm taking dabs of the Copper Chem Nectar
[01:12.520 --> 01:14.520]  from Green Dot Labs.
[01:14.520 --> 01:17.360]  The Copper Chem is a combo of Chem 4 and Star Dog.
[01:17.360 --> 01:19.300]  It's described as perfumey chem
[01:19.300 --> 01:21.320]  with assorted fruit candies.
[01:21.320 --> 01:24.440]  You know, when I smelled it, it smells like Chem Dog to me.
[01:24.440 --> 01:26.220]  It smells a lot like Chem Dog,
[01:26.220 --> 01:29.200]  but then there is a hint of copper or pennies
[01:29.200 --> 01:30.040]  inside of there.
[01:30.040 --> 01:32.060]  It's like you ran a batch of Chem Dog hash,
[01:32.060 --> 01:33.160]  you had the Chem Dog nectar,
[01:33.160 --> 01:35.600]  and then you just poured some copper pennies right into it
[01:36.240 --> 01:37.240]  is what this smells like to me.
[01:37.240 --> 01:38.380]  Then when you dab it,
[01:38.380 --> 01:42.360]  it's got a tennis ball, fresh tire sort of a smell,
[01:42.360 --> 01:45.440]  plus that copper penny kind of stays on your tongue
[01:45.440 --> 01:46.280]  at the end.
[01:46.280 --> 01:48.920]  I do enjoy it, and the high from this is amazing.
[01:48.920 --> 01:50.560]  It's got me going, it's got me talkative,
[01:50.560 --> 01:52.680]  it's got my eyes bugging out of my head.
[01:52.680 --> 01:54.960]  This should be a great podcast.
[01:54.960 --> 01:56.740]  Also, I should give a shout out to my friends
[01:56.740 --> 01:57.760]  at Elevate Glass.
[01:57.760 --> 01:59.360]  Today I picked up a new banger.
[01:59.360 --> 02:01.480]  I was taking dabs of the Copper Chem Nectar
[02:01.480 --> 02:03.880]  out of a brand new banger with the insert,
[02:03.880 --> 02:04.940]  and I got smart.
[02:05.460 --> 02:08.420]  I took one of my, we call them Terp Pearls or Terp Spinners.
[02:08.420 --> 02:10.420]  It's just a little glass bead basically.
[02:10.420 --> 02:12.800]  I took an eight millimeter glass bead,
[02:12.800 --> 02:14.800]  and I put that inside of my insert,
[02:14.800 --> 02:17.500]  where my insert, the insert that drops into the banger.
[02:17.500 --> 02:18.620]  So I put my dab in there,
[02:18.620 --> 02:20.860]  then I dropped the Terp Pearl, the spinner,
[02:20.860 --> 02:22.780]  on top of the dab inside of the insert.
[02:22.780 --> 02:24.340]  Then I heat the banger,
[02:24.340 --> 02:26.940]  then I drop the insert inside the banger
[02:26.940 --> 02:29.540]  with the dab and the Terp Spinner in there.
[02:29.540 --> 02:30.660]  Then I carb cap it,
[02:30.660 --> 02:33.580]  give it a couple of seconds for that dab to start melting.
[02:33.580 --> 02:36.780]  Then I start drawing on it and moving the carb cap around.
[02:36.780 --> 02:39.200]  And I noticed that that Terp Pearl
[02:39.200 --> 02:42.920]  or that Terp Spinner inside my insert dish
[02:42.920 --> 02:45.540]  really helped move that concentrate around in there.
[02:45.540 --> 02:46.900]  The more I wiggled that carb cap,
[02:46.900 --> 02:48.900]  I could watch the Terp Spinner move,
[02:48.900 --> 02:50.340]  and then it would just push the puddle of oil
[02:50.340 --> 02:51.740]  from one spot to another.
[02:51.740 --> 02:54.420]  And I feel like it really made my dab,
[02:54.420 --> 02:57.660]  it didn't burn, it vaporized much more evenly
[02:57.660 --> 02:59.580]  at a nicer speed, at a nicer temperature.
[02:59.580 --> 03:01.620]  And I feel like none of it settled on the bottom
[03:01.620 --> 03:03.020]  and started to singe there
[03:03.460 --> 03:05.140]  because that Terp Pearl was moving it around so much.
[03:05.140 --> 03:06.980]  So I did an insert dab
[03:06.980 --> 03:09.480]  with the Terp Pearl inside the insert.
[03:09.480 --> 03:11.140]  I did not use the appropriate carb cap
[03:11.140 --> 03:13.340]  to make the Terp Pearl spin,
[03:13.340 --> 03:15.940]  but I was able to move it around enough with my carb cap.
[03:15.940 --> 03:17.760]  Something I've noticed, you guys,
[03:17.760 --> 03:20.020]  just a change I've made in my dabbing.
[03:20.020 --> 03:24.420]  Most of my carb caps have a semi-large opening
[03:24.420 --> 03:25.900]  for the air to flow through.
[03:25.900 --> 03:28.940]  My newest carb cap has a really small opening.
[03:28.940 --> 03:30.140]  It's really restrictive.
[03:30.140 --> 03:32.460]  And I feel like I'm getting better dabs
[03:32.900 --> 03:34.660]  with a more restrictive carb cap.
[03:34.660 --> 03:36.620]  I was really satisfied with the Thermal Banger,
[03:36.620 --> 03:39.080]  but I think I am kind of slowly making the switch
[03:39.080 --> 03:40.300]  to these insert dabs.
[03:40.300 --> 03:41.180]  They're a little more work,
[03:41.180 --> 03:42.740]  they take a little more to prepare
[03:42.740 --> 03:43.940]  and a little more to clean up,
[03:43.940 --> 03:45.720]  but you don't need as many of them.
[03:45.720 --> 03:48.060]  And sometimes I actually enjoy the ritual.
[03:48.060 --> 03:51.140]  I think a lot of cannabis users, pot smokers,
[03:51.140 --> 03:53.920]  we just enjoy the ritual of getting our stash
[03:53.920 --> 03:55.500]  and spending a moment with your stash,
[03:55.500 --> 03:57.580]  whether it's grinding up a little bit of weed
[03:57.580 --> 03:59.380]  to roll a joint, or maybe you're old school,
[03:59.380 --> 04:01.660]  maybe you're still picking the seeds out of your herb.
[04:01.820 --> 04:02.780]  That's part of the ritual.
[04:02.780 --> 04:05.100]  You get your stash out, your little secret stash,
[04:05.100 --> 04:07.380]  and you got your album cover or whatever it is
[04:07.380 --> 04:09.260]  that you use to work on your stash,
[04:09.260 --> 04:10.660]  and then you go through the little ritual.
[04:10.660 --> 04:13.980]  I actually enjoy the ritual of which dab do I wanna hit?
[04:13.980 --> 04:15.140]  I grab a little container and I'm like,
[04:15.140 --> 04:17.460]  ooh, the Copper Cam, and then I pick myself out a dab,
[04:17.460 --> 04:19.180]  and which rig am I gonna hit?
[04:19.180 --> 04:20.300]  I'm gonna do an insert dab,
[04:20.300 --> 04:22.180]  so I put a little dab in the insert,
[04:22.180 --> 04:23.860]  and then I thought, ooh, I'm gonna put a Pearl in there,
[04:23.860 --> 04:25.740]  and then I'm gonna heat up a rig.
[04:25.740 --> 04:27.300]  It's just a really nice ritual.
[04:27.300 --> 04:29.780]  I've been enjoying the new rituals
[04:29.780 --> 04:31.140]  of preparing the insert dab,
[04:31.140 --> 04:32.460]  then enjoying the insert dab,
[04:32.460 --> 04:34.260]  and then, of course, there's the little bit of cleanup.
[04:34.260 --> 04:35.700]  You gotta pull the insert out,
[04:35.700 --> 04:36.780]  then you gotta clean up the insert,
[04:36.780 --> 04:38.100]  then you gotta clean up the banger,
[04:38.100 --> 04:40.300]  and then hopefully you just repeat the process
[04:40.300 --> 04:41.500]  and take a couple of more dabs,
[04:41.500 --> 04:43.900]  but insert dabs have been a lot of fun for me.
[04:43.900 --> 04:46.140]  I've really been enjoying it, getting a lot more flavor,
[04:46.140 --> 04:48.580]  and I feel like it is conserving my concentrates
[04:48.580 --> 04:50.740]  a little bit better since I am not burning
[04:50.740 --> 04:52.500]  that first initial part of the dab off
[04:52.500 --> 04:53.980]  as soon as it hits the banger.
[04:53.980 --> 04:55.980]  I feel like I'm getting more,
[04:55.980 --> 04:59.780]  I'm getting to consume more of my dabs that I'm paying for.
[04:59.780 --> 05:01.120]  So that's what I'm smoking on today, you guys.
[05:02.100 --> 05:03.160]  I'm taking dabs of the Copper Chem Nectar,
[05:03.160 --> 05:06.520]  I'm hitting a Hitman Hammerhead Sidecar Rig
[05:06.520 --> 05:08.000]  with a Quartz Banger.
[05:08.000 --> 05:09.800]  I'm loading the dab into an insert.
[05:09.800 --> 05:13.400]  I drop a Terp Spinner or a Terp Pearl inside of the insert.
[05:13.400 --> 05:17.240]  I heat the banger, drop the insert into the banger,
[05:17.240 --> 05:19.640]  then I cap it with a bubble cap
[05:19.640 --> 05:21.360]  that is also very restrictive,
[05:21.360 --> 05:23.480]  and I give it a couple of seconds to start melting,
[05:23.480 --> 05:24.320]  and you guys, I've been getting
[05:24.320 --> 05:28.200]  some of the most satisfying dabs I've had in a long time.
[05:28.200 --> 05:30.800]  So that's the long version of what I am smoking on today.
[05:31.480 --> 05:32.400]  Shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs.
[05:32.400 --> 05:33.240]  What up, Tim Martin?
[05:33.240 --> 05:34.060]  I hope you're doing well.
[05:34.060 --> 05:37.040]  And also shout out to everybody at Elevate Glass
[05:37.040 --> 05:39.600]  for taking such good care of me.
[05:39.600 --> 05:40.840]  All right, I've got one more quick thing
[05:40.840 --> 05:42.200]  I wanna talk about before I get into
[05:42.200 --> 05:43.720]  the main topic of the show.
[05:43.720 --> 05:46.800]  A lot of people listen to the podcast on Stitcher Radio.
[05:46.800 --> 05:48.640]  Stitcher Radio is an application.
[05:48.640 --> 05:50.540]  If you're not using Stitcher, that's fine.
[05:50.540 --> 05:51.760]  You're not missing anything.
[05:51.760 --> 05:54.120]  Your life is probably better for it already.
[05:54.120 --> 05:55.680]  If you're listening to the show on Stitcher
[05:55.680 --> 05:59.680]  and you are still experiencing problems, I do apologize.
[05:59.680 --> 06:02.160]  I've been in contact with Stitcher quite frequently
[06:02.160 --> 06:03.520]  over the past couple of weeks,
[06:03.520 --> 06:05.400]  and we are working to resolve the issue.
[06:05.400 --> 06:08.600]  We are not sure why my show is having problems
[06:08.600 --> 06:09.960]  on Stitcher Radio.
[06:09.960 --> 06:12.300]  What I would recommend, if you are a Stitcher listener
[06:12.300 --> 06:14.040]  and you're having issues, I would recommend
[06:14.040 --> 06:17.360]  you just jump over to YouTube and watch the show on YouTube.
[06:17.360 --> 06:19.320]  Every episode is available on YouTube.
[06:19.320 --> 06:22.960]  Episode one through 346 is up on YouTube,
[06:22.960 --> 06:25.260]  so you can watch everything there.
[06:25.260 --> 06:27.400]  YouTube does not compress my sound quality,
[06:27.400 --> 06:29.980]  so it probably sounds better on YouTube anyway,
[06:29.980 --> 06:32.760]  and the loading issues that people are experiencing
[06:32.760 --> 06:35.480]  will not happen on YouTube like they are on Stitcher.
[06:35.480 --> 06:37.600]  So if you've been listening on Stitcher and having issues,
[06:37.600 --> 06:38.960]  again, I do apologize.
[06:38.960 --> 06:41.640]  I encourage you just to jump right over to YouTube.
[06:41.640 --> 06:43.200]  And if you're not already subscribed
[06:43.200 --> 06:45.360]  to the YouTube channel, I encourage everybody
[06:45.360 --> 06:47.160]  to go subscribe to the Grow From Your Heart
[06:47.160 --> 06:48.840]  podcast YouTube channel.
[06:48.840 --> 06:50.360]  I'm getting a lot of subscribers,
[06:50.360 --> 06:52.840]  and I do appreciate that support.
[06:52.840 --> 06:54.660]  All right, you guys, I feel like that's a solid intro
[06:54.660 --> 06:55.500]  for a podcast.
[06:55.500 --> 06:56.660]  I'm gonna press pause.
[06:56.660 --> 06:58.940]  I'm gonna take one of these insert dabs,
[06:58.940 --> 07:01.460]  and when I come back, I'm going to talk about
[07:01.460 --> 07:05.320]  the function of carbohydrates in your cannabis grow.
[07:05.320 --> 07:06.300]  Take a dab with me, you guys.
[07:06.300 --> 07:07.220]  I'll be right back.
[07:17.750 --> 07:19.750]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[07:19.750 --> 07:21.250]  I am well hydrated.
[07:21.250 --> 07:22.970]  I am heavily medicated.
[07:22.970 --> 07:25.350]  I took a big old dab of that Copper Chem.
[07:25.350 --> 07:27.310]  I had to go chill out on the couch for a second.
[07:27.310 --> 07:29.910]  I had to go get some Instagram time in after that.
[07:29.910 --> 07:32.110]  That was a little bit more than I bargained for.
[07:32.110 --> 07:33.010]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[07:33.010 --> 07:34.190]  I hope you took a fat dab.
[07:34.190 --> 07:36.550]  I hope you're smoking something delicious.
[07:36.550 --> 07:37.950]  Just know that if you're stuck at work,
[07:37.950 --> 07:39.230]  if you're in a cubicle or something,
[07:39.230 --> 07:42.950]  I'm probably high enough for both of us right now.
[07:42.950 --> 07:44.310]  But that's okay, I'm not driving.
[07:44.310 --> 07:45.230]  I'm sitting in a chair.
[07:45.230 --> 07:46.470]  I'm safe.
[07:46.470 --> 07:48.810]  I'm not at work, so nobody can fire me.
[07:48.810 --> 07:50.430]  And hopefully when you get off work,
[07:50.430 --> 07:52.230]  you've got a big fat joint rolled up at home
[07:52.230 --> 07:55.350]  so you can get as high as I am right now.
[07:55.350 --> 07:56.730]  Now let's turn down that music a little bit
[07:56.730 --> 08:00.710]  and get into a podcast about carbohydrates.
[08:00.710 --> 08:01.910]  Let's start right off at the top.
[08:01.910 --> 08:04.030]  What are carbohydrates?
[08:04.870 --> 08:06.230]  I guess I should be more specific
[08:06.230 --> 08:09.150]  because these are carbohydrates in plants,
[08:09.150 --> 08:12.030]  in cannabis plants even more specifically.
[08:12.030 --> 08:15.630]  Carbohydrates are compounds produced during photosynthesis
[08:15.630 --> 08:19.390]  and plant carbohydrates have two main purposes.
[08:19.390 --> 08:22.430]  Their first purpose is to provide building blocks
[08:22.430 --> 08:24.910]  for plant structural components such as cellulose,
[08:24.910 --> 08:28.130]  which is important in building cell walls.
[08:28.130 --> 08:29.750]  The second purpose of carbohydrates
[08:29.750 --> 08:32.990]  is to deliver energy for plant growth.
[08:33.930 --> 08:36.510]  Plants make food in the form of carbohydrates
[08:36.510 --> 08:39.090]  by combining carbon dioxide and water
[08:39.090 --> 08:42.870]  and using energy from either the sun or our grow lights.
[08:42.870 --> 08:44.610]  Now our plants can immediately use
[08:44.610 --> 08:46.450]  or they can store the carbohydrates
[08:46.450 --> 08:49.630]  and those stored carbohydrates can be converted to cellulose
[08:49.630 --> 08:52.830]  or other structural carbohydrates.
[08:52.830 --> 08:56.550]  Now, excess carbs are stored in the plant's roots
[08:56.550 --> 08:58.610]  and leaves and primarily are stored
[08:58.610 --> 09:00.910]  in the form of starches.
[09:01.850 --> 09:03.570]  The plant store those carbohydrates
[09:03.570 --> 09:05.810]  to use during the flowering phase.
[09:05.810 --> 09:07.650]  When the daylight hours are reduced,
[09:07.650 --> 09:10.690]  the plants aren't able to produce as many carbohydrates
[09:10.690 --> 09:14.330]  because the lack of sunlight or grow light energy.
[09:14.330 --> 09:17.130]  So they have it stored up for when that time comes.
[09:17.130 --> 09:20.470]  Now, most of the carbohydrate production in our plants
[09:20.470 --> 09:22.810]  will happen during the vegetative phase
[09:22.810 --> 09:26.330]  and it will taper off during the first three weeks
[09:26.330 --> 09:27.730]  of the bloom phase.
[09:27.730 --> 09:31.290]  So basically by the end of the third week,
[09:31.290 --> 09:33.930]  the start of the fourth week of bloom,
[09:33.930 --> 09:36.330]  the carbohydrate production in cannabis plants
[09:36.330 --> 09:39.570]  basically has stopped without our assistance.
[09:39.570 --> 09:41.330]  If we don't step in and add something,
[09:41.330 --> 09:43.870]  there will be no carbohydrate production
[09:43.870 --> 09:45.570]  through the rest of this plant's life.
[09:45.570 --> 09:50.450]  So that's when we step in and we add carbohydrates.
[09:50.450 --> 09:53.210]  Now, just because the plant stops producing its own carbs
[09:53.210 --> 09:55.250]  around week three or four of flower
[09:55.250 --> 09:57.530]  doesn't mean you have to wait until then
[09:58.330 --> 09:59.170]  to start supplementing the carbs.
[09:59.170 --> 10:01.690]  You can add them early on in the plant's life.
[10:01.690 --> 10:03.250]  You could start them when the plants get big,
[10:03.250 --> 10:04.210]  when they're in veg,
[10:04.210 --> 10:06.290]  because the carbs do have another function
[10:06.290 --> 10:08.910]  that I'll talk about a little later in the show.
[10:08.910 --> 10:10.850]  So you don't have to wait until the plants
[10:10.850 --> 10:14.170]  stop producing their own carbs to introduce your own.
[10:14.170 --> 10:17.250]  Now, we understand that carbohydrates are a source of energy
[10:17.250 --> 10:19.570]  and also major building blocks for our plants.
[10:19.570 --> 10:22.010]  And we also understand that our plants
[10:22.010 --> 10:24.050]  stop producing them on its own
[10:24.050 --> 10:26.630]  around the third or fourth week of flower.
[10:26.630 --> 10:28.830]  Now, that's right when our plants really start taking off.
[10:28.830 --> 10:30.950]  We start seeing bud set happen,
[10:30.950 --> 10:33.370]  that stretches over and we're starting to get chunky buds
[10:33.370 --> 10:34.990]  right around that time.
[10:34.990 --> 10:37.910]  So that's when we need a lot of energy.
[10:37.910 --> 10:42.150]  That carbohydrate energy is used to produce big buds,
[10:42.150 --> 10:45.070]  big robust stems, lots of trichomes,
[10:45.070 --> 10:48.470]  and then a lot of essential oils.
[10:48.470 --> 10:50.710]  So our plants running out of carbohydrates
[10:50.710 --> 10:53.790]  right at that crucial time, that essential time,
[10:53.790 --> 10:56.350]  is kind of detrimental to a cannabis grower.
[10:57.430 --> 11:00.550]  Now, most plants aren't designed or expected
[11:00.550 --> 11:04.150]  to perform the way we expect our cannabis plants to perform.
[11:04.150 --> 11:08.090]  We want the biggest, fattest, most potent product
[11:08.090 --> 11:11.030]  we could possibly create in the shortest amount of time,
[11:11.030 --> 11:12.990]  in the smallest amount of space
[11:12.990 --> 11:14.670]  with the best resistance to bugs
[11:14.670 --> 11:17.310]  and the best resistance to pathogens.
[11:17.310 --> 11:20.590]  But nature didn't intend for this plant
[11:20.590 --> 11:24.310]  to become a rocket ship or a Formula One race car.
[11:24.310 --> 11:28.330]  Nature intended this plant to survive and be good enough.
[11:28.330 --> 11:30.350]  Nature made this plant to where it would grow
[11:30.350 --> 11:32.570]  and get an apical dominant top
[11:32.570 --> 11:35.510]  that would receive pollen more likely than the lowers,
[11:35.510 --> 11:37.110]  so where it had that huge shuttle.
[11:37.110 --> 11:38.870]  Hey, look, I'm right here, pollinate me.
[11:38.870 --> 11:40.750]  And it made it to where the male plants grow taller,
[11:40.750 --> 11:42.270]  to where it would drop pollen down.
[11:42.270 --> 11:44.830]  And it knew, if I do this, I should survive.
[11:44.830 --> 11:47.950]  So cannabis evolved to be a survival plant.
[11:47.990 --> 11:51.430]  We manipulated it and bred it to be
[11:51.430 --> 11:53.150]  this high-performance plant
[11:53.150 --> 11:54.330]  that we're trying to get out of it.
[11:54.330 --> 11:57.790]  Nature never intended this from the cannabis plant.
[11:57.790 --> 11:59.590]  It evolved for tons of years.
[11:59.590 --> 12:01.670]  I don't have any idea how long, honestly.
[12:01.670 --> 12:04.390]  But the plant evolved for thousands of years by itself
[12:04.390 --> 12:05.870]  without humans touching it.
[12:05.870 --> 12:06.910]  It survived.
[12:06.910 --> 12:08.790]  We're trying to push it to do something
[12:08.790 --> 12:10.830]  it was never expected to do.
[12:10.830 --> 12:13.310]  Of course, we've done some breeding to create genetics
[12:13.310 --> 12:15.630]  that were ideal for our indoor environment.
[12:15.630 --> 12:18.830]  We've done breeding to find the high-testing cultivars.
[12:18.830 --> 12:22.070]  We have bred it to be a high-performance machine
[12:22.070 --> 12:24.950]  because we've realized that it's a commodity.
[12:24.950 --> 12:27.430]  And so now, after realizing it's a commodity,
[12:27.430 --> 12:30.030]  we wanna push our plants to the extreme,
[12:30.030 --> 12:32.530]  and we expect them to outperform themselves
[12:32.530 --> 12:33.950]  crop after crop.
[12:33.950 --> 12:35.750]  You always hear a grower, would you pull this time?
[12:35.750 --> 12:37.710]  I got two pounds per light.
[12:37.710 --> 12:40.190]  Cool, bro, you better get two and a quarter next time.
[12:40.190 --> 12:41.310]  You're like, oh shit.
[12:41.310 --> 12:43.230]  Not only is that a lot of pressure on the grower,
[12:43.230 --> 12:45.310]  that's a lot of pressure on that cultivar.
[12:45.990 --> 12:47.230]  Maybe that plant can't do that.
[12:47.230 --> 12:49.630]  Maybe, like if you've got some of the older,
[12:49.630 --> 12:52.670]  more finicky OG Kushes, two pounds of light,
[12:52.670 --> 12:53.710]  you should be happy.
[12:53.710 --> 12:54.550]  You know what I mean?
[12:54.550 --> 12:56.430]  If you're like, I got two and a quarter,
[12:56.430 --> 12:58.950]  you're fucking, you're Jesus of growing back in the day
[12:58.950 --> 13:01.150]  if you were doing that with some of the OG plants
[13:01.150 --> 13:02.830]  and some of the equipment that we had,
[13:02.830 --> 13:04.510]  and then you were expected to do even better
[13:04.510 --> 13:06.550]  on the next grow, so that's crazy.
[13:06.550 --> 13:09.470]  So we've got a lot of expectations for these plants,
[13:09.470 --> 13:12.750]  and we've bred them to try to meet these expectations.
[13:12.750 --> 13:14.750]  So now that we've bred monsters,
[13:15.190 --> 13:16.710]  we've gotta feed them like monsters.
[13:16.710 --> 13:18.630]  We've gotta meet their expectations,
[13:18.630 --> 13:23.630]  which is now more energy in the form of more carbohydrates.
[13:23.710 --> 13:25.550]  So to keep our plants running strong
[13:25.550 --> 13:28.190]  after their natural carbohydrate production has ended,
[13:28.190 --> 13:32.150]  we step in and we add our own carbohydrates.
[13:32.150 --> 13:33.890]  If you've ever seen your plant slow down,
[13:33.890 --> 13:36.150]  like right around week four,
[13:36.150 --> 13:38.590]  maybe the start of week five of flower,
[13:38.590 --> 13:39.790]  and you can't figure out why,
[13:39.790 --> 13:43.070]  like your pH is on point, the CO2 is cool,
[13:43.150 --> 13:44.470]  the lighting is just fine,
[13:44.470 --> 13:47.110]  you got enough airflow in there, the VPD is good,
[13:48.110 --> 13:51.230]  maybe those plants were lacking carbohydrate energy.
[13:51.230 --> 13:53.510]  That's why they just slowed down just a little bit.
[13:53.510 --> 13:54.970]  They could've gone a little bit faster.
[13:54.970 --> 13:56.750]  You've seen them go faster before.
[13:56.750 --> 13:58.910]  Maybe they just ran out of energy.
[13:58.910 --> 14:02.350]  So consider your physical performance right now.
[14:02.350 --> 14:04.030]  Like just think about what you do,
[14:04.030 --> 14:07.030]  your physical performance level on a daily basis.
[14:07.030 --> 14:09.510]  Consider your nutritional intake
[14:09.510 --> 14:14.350]  and what it takes for your body to perform the way you do.
[14:14.350 --> 14:16.550]  What do you have to eat to keep your body in shape
[14:16.550 --> 14:17.510]  to do that?
[14:17.510 --> 14:19.450]  How many calories do you have to consume
[14:19.450 --> 14:22.830]  to have the energy to perform your daily tasks?
[14:22.830 --> 14:25.670]  Now you're performing at your normal, natural level,
[14:25.670 --> 14:26.670]  your expected level.
[14:26.670 --> 14:28.670]  Now let's say if I expected you
[14:28.670 --> 14:31.430]  to increase your performance by 30%,
[14:31.430 --> 14:34.710]  I want you to work 30% harder, 30% longer,
[14:34.710 --> 14:38.590]  and I need a production of a minimum of 30% more.
[14:38.590 --> 14:41.070]  Do you think I'd probably have to increase your feed
[14:41.070 --> 14:41.890]  and your pay?
[14:41.890 --> 14:42.910]  I know I'm gonna have to increase your pay also,
[14:42.910 --> 14:44.990]  but I'm gonna have to increase your feed
[14:44.990 --> 14:49.230]  by a minimum of 30% to try to get 30% more production
[14:49.230 --> 14:51.430]  out of you, or you're gonna burn out.
[14:51.430 --> 14:53.390]  Now keep that in mind with your cannabis plants.
[14:53.390 --> 14:56.390]  It's the same sort of thing with your plants.
[14:56.390 --> 15:00.410]  When we start introducing things like high-end nutrients,
[15:00.410 --> 15:05.410]  double-ended Govita bulbs, CO2, supplemental LED lighting,
[15:05.510 --> 15:06.790]  and then we start implementing things
[15:06.790 --> 15:08.510]  like pruning the bottoms off,
[15:09.350 --> 15:10.950]  and then we do things like cracking the stems,
[15:10.950 --> 15:12.990]  we're expecting a lot from our plants,
[15:12.990 --> 15:15.030]  and we need to provide those plants
[15:15.030 --> 15:18.150]  with the proper nutrition to see the results
[15:18.150 --> 15:19.850]  which we demand.
[15:20.830 --> 15:23.390]  All right, now that we understand what carbohydrates are
[15:23.390 --> 15:25.830]  and what they do in our plants and why we need them
[15:25.830 --> 15:27.850]  and why we need to add them ourselves,
[15:27.850 --> 15:29.990]  let's talk a little bit about how we can add
[15:29.990 --> 15:32.030]  the carbohydrates ourselves.
[15:33.190 --> 15:35.830]  Don't try to foliar feed a carbohydrate product
[15:35.830 --> 15:36.830]  to your plants.
[15:36.830 --> 15:38.510]  If you go spraying carbs onto your plants,
[15:38.510 --> 15:39.710]  you're just gonna clog shit up.
[15:39.710 --> 15:41.630]  It's gonna be a gross mess.
[15:41.630 --> 15:43.230]  Don't do that.
[15:43.230 --> 15:45.390]  The best way to feed carbohydrates
[15:45.390 --> 15:48.510]  is to add a carbohydrate product to your water
[15:48.510 --> 15:50.430]  and your nutrient solution,
[15:50.430 --> 15:53.230]  just like any other bottled nutrient, and water it in.
[15:54.430 --> 15:56.830]  Carbs are best absorbed through the roots.
[15:56.830 --> 15:58.490]  Now right away, a lot of people are gonna tell you
[15:58.490 --> 16:01.570]  to add molasses to your feed solution
[16:01.570 --> 16:02.950]  to increase your carbohydrates.
[16:02.950 --> 16:05.010]  I have used molasses in the past,
[16:05.010 --> 16:08.650]  but I wouldn't recommend just store-bought molasses.
[16:08.650 --> 16:09.850]  I wouldn't do that.
[16:09.850 --> 16:11.970]  Back in the day, yes, I did do that.
[16:11.970 --> 16:14.170]  Maybe back in the day I have said to do that,
[16:14.170 --> 16:15.730]  but I wouldn't do it anymore.
[16:15.730 --> 16:18.850]  Store-bought molasses is really unreliable.
[16:18.850 --> 16:22.490]  It's very inconsistent, not only from brand to brand,
[16:22.490 --> 16:25.410]  from region to region, but you could buy the same brand.
[16:25.410 --> 16:26.610]  You could buy two bottles,
[16:26.610 --> 16:29.170]  and you could pour that molasses into two bowls,
[16:29.170 --> 16:30.970]  and there'll be two different consistencies,
[16:30.970 --> 16:32.930]  two different colors, two different smells,
[16:32.930 --> 16:36.370]  and we like a little bit of regulation in cannabis growth
[16:36.370 --> 16:38.330]  so that we know what we are feeding our plants.
[16:38.330 --> 16:39.690]  That way, if we see a problem,
[16:39.690 --> 16:42.970]  we know it was that and maybe not maybe that.
[16:42.970 --> 16:44.850]  I don't wanna say it could have been the molasses,
[16:44.850 --> 16:47.770]  so stick with a horticultural product.
[16:47.770 --> 16:50.110]  You organic guys that like to go all organic,
[16:50.110 --> 16:52.130]  you're gonna probably just wanna use molasses.
[16:52.130 --> 16:52.970]  That's fine.
[16:52.970 --> 16:54.170]  You know what you're doing.
[16:54.170 --> 16:55.450]  Go for that.
[16:55.450 --> 16:59.450]  In my opinion, the molasses is a little bit too thick.
[16:59.450 --> 17:00.810]  It also invites other problems.
[17:00.810 --> 17:02.530]  You can kind of suffocate your roots
[17:03.050 --> 17:05.570]  with too much molasses in your feed solution,
[17:05.570 --> 17:08.330]  and it also, molasses contains other elements.
[17:08.330 --> 17:11.350]  A lot of molasses will contain sulfur,
[17:11.350 --> 17:12.250]  and like I said earlier,
[17:12.250 --> 17:14.690]  we don't wanna add random feed to our plants.
[17:14.690 --> 17:17.890]  We are only trying to add carbohydrates, not sulfur,
[17:17.890 --> 17:20.390]  so the molasses is not a good idea.
[17:20.390 --> 17:22.170]  That's gonna disrupt your feed program,
[17:22.170 --> 17:23.230]  throw off your plant's health.
[17:23.230 --> 17:24.290]  It's gonna be hard to monitor
[17:24.290 --> 17:26.090]  because you don't know what's in that molasses.
[17:26.090 --> 17:29.610]  It could be a myriad of things messing up your process.
[17:29.610 --> 17:31.950]  So if you're using any hydro,
[17:31.950 --> 17:35.070]  definitely stay away from the thick molasses-y type,
[17:35.070 --> 17:37.070]  syrupy kind of products.
[17:37.070 --> 17:38.630]  Those are really just gonna clog up
[17:38.630 --> 17:42.850]  your entire hydro system, so be very careful with that.
[17:42.850 --> 17:45.090]  Also, if you overuse the molasses,
[17:45.090 --> 17:46.190]  you can't flush it out,
[17:46.190 --> 17:48.830]  and your buds will burn like shit in the end.
[17:48.830 --> 17:50.610]  I'll admit it, a long time ago,
[17:50.610 --> 17:52.090]  I wasn't always a really good grower.
[17:52.090 --> 17:54.590]  I had to be a shitty grower to become a good grower,
[17:54.590 --> 17:56.710]  and a long time ago, I wouldn't always read the internet.
[17:56.710 --> 17:58.470]  I wouldn't do the proper research,
[17:58.470 --> 18:01.190]  but I did have a grower friend that I trusted,
[18:01.190 --> 18:03.230]  and he said, bro, just pour this much molasses
[18:03.230 --> 18:05.710]  into your five-gallon thing of fucking nutrient solution,
[18:05.710 --> 18:08.190]  mix it up, get all that molasses mixed in there,
[18:08.190 --> 18:10.910]  then water the plants with it, and it will be great.
[18:10.910 --> 18:13.510]  I way overdid the molasses, in my opinion,
[18:13.510 --> 18:17.670]  because when I smoked those plants, they burned like shit.
[18:17.670 --> 18:19.270]  It was like smoking a charcoal briquette.
[18:19.270 --> 18:20.950]  You'd put it in the grinder, and you'd grind it up,
[18:20.950 --> 18:22.230]  and the grinder would skip.
[18:22.270 --> 18:25.270]  They'd be like, cause the buds were so hard,
[18:25.270 --> 18:27.270]  and that was, I'm certain it was from the molasses,
[18:27.270 --> 18:29.950]  and when they burned, it just all stayed there.
[18:29.950 --> 18:31.510]  There was no white ash crew in there.
[18:31.510 --> 18:33.370]  That was black charcoal ash,
[18:33.370 --> 18:36.190]  and it was from way too much molasses.
[18:36.190 --> 18:38.290]  So I recommend not using molasses,
[18:38.290 --> 18:41.070]  but if you're going to use it, use it sparingly,
[18:41.070 --> 18:42.430]  and if you're an organic grower,
[18:42.430 --> 18:44.990]  that's probably going to be your first option
[18:44.990 --> 18:48.190]  for a carbohydrate sweetener type of product
[18:48.190 --> 18:50.010]  is the molasses.
[18:50.010 --> 18:51.150]  Just read a little bit and see
[18:51.150 --> 18:55.150]  If there are any other options that will satisfy you for your organic grow, I understand if
[18:55.150 --> 18:58.550]  you want to go completely organic and molasses is your thing, don't let me stop you, make
[18:58.550 --> 18:59.590]  yourself happy.
[18:59.590 --> 19:02.750]  I'm just giving you my two cents and if you want to take it, go for it.
[19:02.750 --> 19:04.470]  If you want to grow your way, I encourage that.
[19:04.470 --> 19:05.470]  Grow your way.
[19:05.470 --> 19:09.190]  That's one of my favorite things about cannabis is that my grow is totally different than
[19:09.190 --> 19:10.590]  your grow and they both work.
[19:10.590 --> 19:14.070]  We both put a product on the table at the end of the day that is a top shelf product
[19:14.070 --> 19:16.190]  that people enjoy and it works for our needs.
[19:16.190 --> 19:18.110]  So that's the beauty of growing cannabis.
[19:18.110 --> 19:19.110]  Do what works for you.
[19:19.110 --> 19:20.910]  This is just my input.
[19:20.910 --> 19:26.230]  So I know I said I wouldn't use molasses and I try not to pitch products too much on
[19:26.230 --> 19:32.190]  my show, but here are three products that I am familiar with that I have used that have
[19:32.190 --> 19:35.950]  worked great for carbohydrates in my grow.
[19:35.950 --> 19:42.310]  A long time ago, one of the best crops I ever grew, I used a product called Humboldt Honey.
[19:42.310 --> 19:47.150]  Humboldt Honey has yucca extract, Humboldt Honey has a lot of great things in it and
[19:47.150 --> 19:51.350]  it really made my product taste nice and sweet.
[19:51.350 --> 19:52.350]  Humboldt Honey.
[19:52.350 --> 19:56.710]  They have regular Humboldt Honey and they have a Humboldt Honey hydroponic blend, which
[19:56.710 --> 19:59.710]  is a little thinner so you're not going to mess up all your lines.
[19:59.710 --> 20:01.910]  So Humboldt Honey is a great product.
[20:01.910 --> 20:04.870]  Also I like Hybrix.
[20:04.870 --> 20:07.430]  Hybrix is from a company called Earth Juice.
[20:07.430 --> 20:09.590]  I really like the way Hybrix smells.
[20:09.590 --> 20:11.310]  It's mostly molasses.
[20:11.310 --> 20:15.590]  Another product I really do enjoy is called Sucanat.
[20:15.590 --> 20:16.590]  Sucanat.
[20:16.590 --> 20:24.230]  I learned that one from our friend Subcool probably 10 years ago.
[20:24.230 --> 20:27.910]  And those are three products that you can use for carbohydrates.
[20:27.910 --> 20:30.590]  Again, I don't get paid by a carbohydrate company.
[20:30.590 --> 20:32.990]  Those are things I've got experience with that worked for me.
[20:32.990 --> 20:35.270]  I like the Hybrix because it's very natural.
[20:35.270 --> 20:36.870]  It doesn't have a lot of additives.
[20:36.870 --> 20:39.310]  I liked the Humboldt Honey because of the additive.
[20:39.310 --> 20:41.590]  I like that yucca extract in there.
[20:41.590 --> 20:44.110]  I feel like it did a little something for my plants.
[20:44.150 --> 20:45.510]  Sucanat, that's old school.
[20:45.510 --> 20:48.030]  I was using that a way long time ago.
[20:48.030 --> 20:52.270]  Now, some of those products will be a little molasses-y.
[20:52.270 --> 20:54.910]  And earlier in the show I said don't buy molasses.
[20:54.910 --> 20:58.230]  Now why am I recommending molasses-based shit?
[20:58.230 --> 21:02.310]  Because this stuff has been filtered and it's a little more consistent than the stuff.
[21:02.310 --> 21:04.270]  It's being sold for a horticultural product.
[21:04.270 --> 21:05.350]  It has to meet a standard.
[21:05.350 --> 21:07.070]  It's not just food.
[21:07.070 --> 21:09.910]  Food can have a little variation because it can taste different.
[21:09.910 --> 21:11.270]  It can look a little different.
[21:11.270 --> 21:12.270]  It's food.
[21:12.270 --> 21:13.270]  We expect that.
[21:13.430 --> 21:15.990]  But when it's a horticultural product, they put a little different standard to it.
[21:15.990 --> 21:20.670]  I would like to think, I can't promise you that, I can't assure you that, but the consistencies
[21:20.670 --> 21:24.550]  are a little better to work with when you're buying them as a horticultural product.
[21:24.550 --> 21:30.790]  The Botanicare Blackstrap Molasses is really thick and a pain in the ass to work with.
[21:30.790 --> 21:34.390]  If that's what you're thinking you're going to do, I'm not going to try and discourage
[21:34.390 --> 21:35.390]  you.
[21:35.390 --> 21:36.790]  That stuff is a pain in the ass to work with.
[21:36.790 --> 21:41.790]  You get a big old container of just, it looks like tar and it's really hard to work with.
[21:42.790 --> 21:48.110]  Back in the day, I went through several containers of it and it was all very consistent.
[21:48.110 --> 21:52.030]  That's what I'm saying about don't buy molasses from the store, like the grocery store.
[21:52.030 --> 21:54.470]  Don't go buy Granny's Blackstrap Molasses.
[21:54.470 --> 21:58.950]  Go to the hydro store, go to a grow store and get a horticultural product that is more
[21:58.950 --> 22:04.790]  homogenized, more regulated, and more uniform and more consistent so that that way you can
[22:04.790 --> 22:06.990]  dial it in.
[22:06.990 --> 22:08.850]  That's usually the opposite of what I would say.
[22:09.210 --> 22:13.690]  If you can find that product not at a grow store, go get it not at a grow store.
[22:13.690 --> 22:18.970]  For this one occasion, I'm going to recommend that you get an actual growing product.
[22:18.970 --> 22:22.490]  I just did a quick Google search just so I could do some price checking.
[22:22.490 --> 22:26.570]  It was funny because I ended up on a forum and everybody says that the Blackstrap Molasses
[22:26.570 --> 22:30.810]  is a pain in the ass because they end up wasting half of it because of the stupid container.
[22:30.810 --> 22:33.870]  That's what I said before I even went for the Google search.
[22:33.870 --> 22:37.170]  What comes up when I look for hybrids and when I look for Humboldt Honey?
[22:37.170 --> 22:38.170]  This is mostly molasses.
[22:38.170 --> 22:40.530]  It's a little bit diluted so that it works better.
[22:40.530 --> 22:42.130]  They don't say that they add anything to it.
[22:42.130 --> 22:45.370]  They just say that it's been thinned to where it works for your plants.
[22:45.370 --> 22:50.810]  The Humboldt Honey has additives and it is quite pricey compared to the Hybrix.
[22:50.810 --> 22:54.130]  If you've got a little money to spend, I would say throw it at the Humboldt Honey.
[22:54.130 --> 22:58.250]  If you're trying to go low budget, I think that Hybrix would make you and your plants
[22:58.250 --> 22:59.890]  just as happy.
[22:59.890 --> 23:03.770]  Like I said earlier, if you're trying to go all organic, I think the Hybrix may qualify.
[23:03.770 --> 23:06.010]  I think it is listed as organic.
[23:06.010 --> 23:08.890]  If you want to stick with just molasses, that is up to you.
[23:08.890 --> 23:13.130]  Just keep in mind, they do add things or there could be things in the molasses that you're
[23:13.130 --> 23:15.450]  not aware of.
[23:15.450 --> 23:20.130]  If you do choose to use either the blackstrap molasses from the store or the botanic hair
[23:20.130 --> 23:22.210]  kind, stir it up.
[23:22.210 --> 23:27.290]  Make sure it gets diluted or dissolved or whatever because it's really, really thick
[23:27.290 --> 23:31.690]  and it's going to take a long time, a lot of stirring to break that stuff down.
[23:31.690 --> 23:35.450]  That's another reason just to work toward either some Humboldt Honey or the Hybrix.
[23:35.450 --> 23:39.290]  It'll make your life a lot easier and you'll find yourself spending less time cleaning
[23:39.290 --> 23:40.850]  up sticky shit.
[23:40.850 --> 23:44.930]  Honestly, I'm using the Hybrix right now because I stopped at a local grocery store
[23:44.930 --> 23:48.770]  and they did not carry Humboldt Honey and the Hybrix was quite affordable.
[23:48.770 --> 23:53.450]  So that's the product I chose and I've been using the Hybrix off and on for several
[23:53.450 --> 23:54.450]  years.
[23:54.450 --> 23:58.650]  Shout out to my friend Donovan from way back in the day who introduced me to Earth Juice
[23:58.650 --> 23:59.650]  Nutrients.
[24:00.650 --> 24:06.770]  Earlier I mentioned that carbohydrates had an additional benefit to our grow that they
[24:06.770 --> 24:12.170]  would be useful from early on in our veg stage all the way through the end of flower.
[24:12.170 --> 24:15.810]  So let's talk about that added benefit that I hinted about earlier.
[24:15.810 --> 24:19.890]  Another added benefit of carbohydrates is that they will feed your microbes in your
[24:19.890 --> 24:21.050]  root zone.
[24:21.050 --> 24:24.890]  All that recharge or that mammoth pea or that great white shark that you've been pouring
[24:24.890 --> 24:27.010]  in there, it needs to be fed.
[24:27.010 --> 24:33.490]  All that beneficial fungus is hungry and it will use these carbohydrates as food and fuel
[24:33.490 --> 24:36.610]  to keep living and reproducing.
[24:36.610 --> 24:38.090]  So your carbs are working double time.
[24:38.090 --> 24:42.530]  They're giving your plants extra energy and they're also feeding your microbes which are
[24:42.530 --> 24:47.650]  keeping the roots healthy, keeping the roots happy, which are also helping the plants absorb
[24:47.650 --> 24:50.250]  more carbohydrates which are making the plants healthier.
[24:50.250 --> 24:51.250]  You see how it all works?
[24:51.250 --> 24:52.970]  It's all in symbiosis here.
[24:52.970 --> 24:57.170]  When we get everything dialed in, everything works together so well in the garden.
[24:57.170 --> 25:00.170]  All right, you guys, that is my podcast on carbohydrates.
[25:00.170 --> 25:02.010]  I hope I taught you something today.
[25:02.010 --> 25:06.450]  I can't wait to hear your input on me talking about not using molasses.
[25:06.450 --> 25:09.170]  I'm sure a lot of people are going to have stuff to say about that.
[25:09.170 --> 25:11.350]  I really do look forward to your feedback.
[25:11.350 --> 25:16.010]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com or you can find me on Twitter.

[25:20.890 --> 25:21.970]  All right, podcast rule.
[25:21.970 --> 25:25.210]  Before I start wrapping up the show, I have got one question for you.

[25:38.810 --> 25:41.250]  choose to smoke a joint with.
[25:41.250 --> 25:42.410]  All right, podcast rule.
[25:42.410 --> 25:43.890]  I think that's all I've got for you.
