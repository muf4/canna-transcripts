[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[00:16.000 --> 00:21.000]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious shit.
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.500]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit.
[00:22.500 --> 00:24.000]  Man, what you gonna do now?
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.500]  What we gonna do right here is go back.
[00:25.500 --> 00:26.500]  Before you going back.
[00:26.500 --> 00:27.500]  Way back.
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  As we go a little something like this.
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.000]  Hit it!
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.500]  Anyways, any promotions or any contests, all of that stuff has expired.
[00:48.500 --> 00:54.000]  There are no advertisements, promotions, giveaways or contests that are valid in these old episodes.
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  I want to thank you guys for listening and with no further ado, here's a block of old
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.000]  episodes of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:17.650 --> 01:19.150]  Welcome back cannabis community.
[01:19.150 --> 01:22.650]  It's time for episode number 126 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:22.650 --> 01:26.650]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[01:26.650 --> 01:30.650]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a news smoker
[01:30.650 --> 01:34.650]  or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[01:34.650 --> 01:38.650]  about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:38.650 --> 01:40.650]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:40.650 --> 01:42.650]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:42.650 --> 01:45.650]  Also, I want to thank my buddy White Mike for joining me again.
[01:45.650 --> 01:46.650]  How you doing today brother?
[01:46.650 --> 01:47.650]  Doing good man, how are you?
[01:47.650 --> 01:48.650]  I am doing good.
[01:48.650 --> 01:50.650]  Now that we got this recording equipment figured out.
[01:50.650 --> 01:55.650]  Yeah, we spent some time working on the sound so that this sounded great for all of you out there.
[01:55.650 --> 01:59.650]  For some reason, 126 episodes into the show, I opened up the recording software and hit go
[01:59.650 --> 02:02.650]  and the recording equipment was just giving me the middle finger.
[02:02.650 --> 02:04.650]  It was like, no, not today.
[02:04.650 --> 02:07.650]  Took a couple of dry runs to get her going, sounding right.
[02:07.650 --> 02:08.650]  I got her fired up.
[02:08.650 --> 02:09.650]  It's working good.
[02:09.650 --> 02:14.650]  I think I've done more damage to my head working on this podcast than I did at like all of the concerts I saw in my early 20s.
[02:14.650 --> 02:16.650]  Working well, I just said it's working good.
[02:16.650 --> 02:17.650]  It's working well.
[02:18.650 --> 02:20.650]  Let's work on our English skills today class.
[02:20.650 --> 02:23.650]  Yeah, I apologize for the headphone malfunctions there.
[02:23.650 --> 02:24.650]  No, we're good.
[02:24.650 --> 02:26.650]  I don't know what was going on with this equipment today.
[02:26.650 --> 02:28.650]  It was super loud and then it was super quiet and then it was extra loud.
[02:28.650 --> 02:30.650]  And you guys don't care.
[02:30.650 --> 02:31.650]  You guys just want a quality show.
[02:31.650 --> 02:32.650]  So let's get into that part.
[02:35.650 --> 02:36.650]  We're going to read some news articles.
[02:36.650 --> 02:38.650]  We may actually play a news article.
[02:38.650 --> 02:44.650]  But first, let's talk about another email that I did not include in the last episode.
[02:44.650 --> 02:47.650]  I think it might have been a Facebook message is why I missed it.
[02:47.650 --> 02:49.650]  Shout out to our friend Rasta Seb.
[02:49.650 --> 02:52.650]  Rasta Seb has had a little bit of bad luck, but things will turn around for you brother.
[02:52.650 --> 02:54.650]  I feel bad for what happened to you.
[02:54.650 --> 02:59.650]  But Rasta Seb sent me a question asking what is reclaim?
[02:59.650 --> 03:00.650]  We can't laugh at the guy.
[03:00.650 --> 03:04.650]  We got to remember not everybody is smoking four and five grams of hash on their day off.
[03:04.650 --> 03:06.650]  Not everybody lives in Colorado.
[03:06.650 --> 03:07.650]  Perfectly valid question.
[03:07.650 --> 03:08.650]  Completely good question.
[03:08.650 --> 03:09.650]  No giggles at all.
[03:09.650 --> 03:11.650]  Most people, well, yeah, a lot of people in Colorado would be like, what's reclaim?
[03:11.650 --> 03:13.650]  Reclaim is this, bro.
[03:13.650 --> 03:17.650]  So for all you folks out there who are not able to consume a whole bunch of Earl.
[03:19.650 --> 03:20.650]  Spoiled hash brat.
[03:22.650 --> 03:29.650]  I talk to people all day who have, I like, I don't even bother to get to reclaim with them because like I already gave them a thesaurus worth of fucking.
[03:29.650 --> 03:31.650]  The look on Mike's face was priceless here.
[03:31.650 --> 03:32.650]  Okay.
[03:32.650 --> 03:33.650]  So let me tell you what reclaim is.
[03:34.650 --> 03:38.650]  When we use a dab rig, we put a nail attached to the rig somehow.
[03:38.650 --> 03:43.650]  It either sits on the outside of a male joint or it sits on the inside of the male joint and then you put a dome on it.
[03:43.650 --> 03:47.650]  Either way you heat up that nail and then you put some hash onto there and you inhale.
[03:48.650 --> 03:52.650]  And as you inhale, some of that hash oil will collect onto your rig.
[03:52.650 --> 03:54.650]  Just like the resin collects on your pipe.
[03:55.650 --> 03:56.650]  They doing good so far, Mike?
[03:56.650 --> 03:57.650]  Yeah.
[03:57.650 --> 03:58.650]  Okay.
[03:58.650 --> 04:04.650]  Just as we vaporize the hash before it all gets to us, some of it on vaporizes and reconstitutes itself into reclaim.
[04:04.650 --> 04:05.650]  Yeah.
[04:05.650 --> 04:07.650]  And then a lot of times that'll fill up in.
[04:07.650 --> 04:12.650]  If you're smoking a BHO, I highly recommend you using a rig.
[04:12.650 --> 04:13.650]  We call the rig a pipe.
[04:13.650 --> 04:14.650]  It's a bong.
[04:14.650 --> 04:15.650]  You guys, it's a small bong.
[04:15.650 --> 04:16.650]  I like a little small bubbler.
[04:16.650 --> 04:17.650]  A special little hash bong.
[04:17.650 --> 04:20.650]  We call it a rig, but I like something small.
[04:20.650 --> 04:23.650]  I highly recommend you smoke with something with water in it.
[04:23.650 --> 04:25.650]  You want that bubble action to cool it down.
[04:25.650 --> 04:26.650]  The hash is really hot.
[04:26.650 --> 04:28.650]  Just cool it a little bit before it gets to your lungs and throat.
[04:28.650 --> 04:29.650]  It'll really help you out.
[04:30.650 --> 04:35.650]  So a lot of times a water will collect a lot of reclaim in there.
[04:35.650 --> 04:36.650]  So there's a lot of claim in the water.
[04:36.650 --> 04:39.650]  There's a lot of claim on the entryway to the pipe.
[04:39.650 --> 04:41.650]  A lot of times I'll use what's called a drop down.
[04:41.650 --> 04:44.650]  I'm grabbing my drop down right now to get a nice visual.
[04:44.650 --> 04:47.650]  The drop down goes onto the rig where the nail would normally go.
[04:47.650 --> 04:49.650]  And it's an extension of glass.
[04:49.650 --> 04:53.650]  It'll actually go a little lower to get the nail out of your face a little bit
[04:53.650 --> 04:54.650]  and get it further away from your head.
[04:54.650 --> 04:55.650]  And then the nail goes on there.
[04:55.650 --> 05:00.650]  And then a lot of the oil, the reclaim oil, will collect right into here.
[05:00.650 --> 05:02.650]  And there's some here that we can talk about.
[05:02.650 --> 05:03.650]  I don't know.
[05:03.650 --> 05:05.650]  That's probably a measurement of one dram.
[05:05.650 --> 05:09.650]  One half dram, I think, is what that would be probably if you poured it out.
[05:09.650 --> 05:10.650]  It'd be half a dram.
[05:10.650 --> 05:11.650]  One of those little tiny vials?
[05:11.650 --> 05:12.650]  Yeah.
[05:12.650 --> 05:14.650]  It'd be half of one of those is what I think.
[05:14.650 --> 05:18.650]  So I've got a half a dram of reclaim that I could remove from here
[05:18.650 --> 05:19.650]  and do something with.
[05:19.650 --> 05:20.650]  So that's what reclaim is.
[05:20.650 --> 05:24.650]  It's basically reconstituted hash oil that's stuck to my piece.
[05:24.650 --> 05:27.650]  What can you do with it was one of his follow-up questions.
[05:27.650 --> 05:32.650]  I've seen people just stick the dabber inside of this mookie part
[05:32.650 --> 05:34.650]  and pull it out and re-dab it.
[05:34.650 --> 05:35.650]  Some people will do that.
[05:35.650 --> 05:37.650]  Our friend 44, he would do that.
[05:37.650 --> 05:39.650]  That's not against his standards.
[05:39.650 --> 05:42.650]  Lots of people go for dabbing it.
[05:42.650 --> 05:46.650]  I know a lot of people who take great care to clean it out
[05:46.650 --> 05:48.650]  and then try to dry it out.
[05:48.650 --> 05:51.650]  Drying it out is the part that I would make sure you do really well.
[05:51.650 --> 05:54.650]  Leave it on some parchment paper or on an oil slick pad
[05:54.650 --> 05:57.650]  and make sure you let it dry really well before you try to dab it again.
[05:57.650 --> 06:00.650]  I talked to one dude who was cleaning his rig with Everclear
[06:00.650 --> 06:05.650]  so that he could throw that into a glass dish when he was done agitating
[06:05.650 --> 06:08.650]  and getting his rig all clean and then slowly evaporate that back down
[06:08.650 --> 06:11.650]  into reclaim powder.
[06:11.650 --> 06:14.650]  I think our friend Gary was teaching me about that a while back.
[06:14.650 --> 06:15.650]  Shout out, Gary.
[06:15.650 --> 06:17.650]  I'm not sure if you still listen to the show,
[06:17.650 --> 06:19.650]  but he was talking about doing something very similar.
[06:19.650 --> 06:22.650]  Our friend Fox with CBD, CBD Extract, runs CBD.
[06:22.650 --> 06:25.650]  I think what he would say would be to make edibles out of it.
[06:25.650 --> 06:29.650]  That's another use that I know a number of people do.
[06:29.650 --> 06:33.650]  It's already been decarboxylized or decarboxylated?
[06:33.650 --> 06:34.650]  Ized.
[06:34.650 --> 06:35.650]  Ized? Okay.
[06:35.650 --> 06:37.650]  You look like you just picked one.
[06:37.650 --> 06:38.650]  I was going to say you just picked one.
[06:38.650 --> 06:40.650]  I said them both in my head and I was like,
[06:40.650 --> 06:41.650]  no, the first one sounds like-
[06:41.650 --> 06:45.650]  It's been decarbed because it's been heated to a temperature above a certain,
[06:45.650 --> 06:47.650]  beyond four, it's been heated.
[06:47.650 --> 06:48.650]  I don't even know how hot the surface of this nail is.
[06:48.650 --> 06:49.650]  It is really hot.
[06:49.650 --> 06:50.650]  It's been heated above that.
[06:50.650 --> 06:51.650]  It's significantly above 100 degrees.
[06:51.650 --> 06:54.650]  It's reconstituted, so it's been activated essentially.
[06:54.650 --> 06:57.650]  When you eat it, it's already broken down so that your body doesn't have to
[06:57.650 --> 07:01.650]  break it down as much to make the psychoactive components bioavailable.
[07:01.650 --> 07:03.650]  Wow, that was deep on accident.
[07:03.650 --> 07:05.650]  Okay, so that's what reclaim is.
[07:06.650 --> 07:10.650]  I may be an asshole because what I do with it is I fill my rig with rubbing
[07:10.650 --> 07:13.650]  alcohol and I shake it up real good and then I pour that shit down the drain.
[07:13.650 --> 07:17.650]  And ironically, for some reason, my garbage disposal doesn't work.
[07:17.650 --> 07:20.650]  It's too high, bro.
[07:20.650 --> 07:21.650]  I'm a vegetarian.
[07:21.650 --> 07:23.650]  I don't eat anything that would really clog that thing up.
[07:23.650 --> 07:24.650]  I don't put anything down there.
[07:24.650 --> 07:25.650]  That just needs some love.
[07:25.650 --> 07:29.650]  I'm like 90% sure I need to pour a bottle of ISO down my garbage disposal.
[07:29.650 --> 07:31.650]  I think that's my only problem is it's just all resiny.
[07:31.650 --> 07:33.650]  I got a whole bunch of reclaim in there.
[07:33.650 --> 07:35.650]  Nine times out of 10, I do the same thing.
[07:35.650 --> 07:40.650]  If I've got a big fat glob of reclaim sitting somewhere that's easy to get to,
[07:40.650 --> 07:44.650]  I'll use my torch to extract it real quick.
[07:44.650 --> 07:45.650]  Just kind of heat it up.
[07:45.650 --> 07:48.650]  Just heat it up a little bit and turn it into basically a liquid, yeah,
[07:48.650 --> 07:50.650]  and then pour it into a silicone container.
[07:50.650 --> 07:53.650]  And I use it for seasoning my nail.
[07:53.650 --> 07:55.650]  That's a great use for it.
[07:55.650 --> 07:58.650]  Honestly, it's the only reason I keep it around.
[07:58.650 --> 08:02.650]  And so I only do it when I've got like a really fat glob sitting there because
[08:02.650 --> 08:05.650]  what I've got now I could season 100 nails with.
[08:05.650 --> 08:06.650]  So we're going to get another question.
[08:06.650 --> 08:08.650]  What the hell does he mean season your nail?
[08:08.650 --> 08:13.650]  When you get a new titanium nail, just like any skillet that you would want to cook on,
[08:13.650 --> 08:14.650]  any pan that you're going to cook on,
[08:14.650 --> 08:18.650]  you're going to want to put some oil or fatty substance on it to grease it up
[08:18.650 --> 08:22.650]  before you cook on it so that you don't taste that cast iron.
[08:22.650 --> 08:24.650]  You don't want to taste cast iron on whatever you're cooking.
[08:24.650 --> 08:28.650]  If you're making some asparagus in there, if you're making pork chops,
[08:28.650 --> 08:29.650]  you don't want to taste fucking cast iron.
[08:29.650 --> 08:31.650]  And you don't want to just taste raw titanium.
[08:31.650 --> 08:35.650]  So when I get a new nail, I'll heat it up just to about dab temperature,
[08:35.650 --> 08:38.650]  and I'll let it cool so that the oil will puddle on there
[08:38.650 --> 08:41.650]  and kind of soak into the pores of the nail.
[08:41.650 --> 08:46.650]  So you want to kind of season your nail before you start dabbing with a brand new titanium nail.
[08:46.650 --> 08:47.650]  And you can do it with quartz also.
[08:47.650 --> 08:51.650]  Once you get a quartz nail perfectly seasoned, it's so smooth and tastes really, really nice.
[08:51.650 --> 08:56.650]  I finally got to hit a really nice quartz banger recently, and it tasted really good.
[08:57.650 --> 09:02.650]  Shout out to Bobo Blaster Co. and The Traveling Stoner and Sloppy919
[09:02.650 --> 09:05.650]  and whoever else, Buzzy, probably was in the house.
[09:05.650 --> 09:08.650]  Shout out to the whole crew. They got to take some dabs.
[09:08.650 --> 09:10.650]  I know where you were, bro.
[09:10.650 --> 09:12.650]  Did I give a shout out to Lindsey? Yes, I did.
[09:12.650 --> 09:14.650]  I gave a shout out to Lindsey on the last episode.
[09:14.650 --> 09:16.650]  That episode came out really well.
[09:16.650 --> 09:18.650]  You did a great job on the show, and Mike, you were awesome also.
[09:18.650 --> 09:21.650]  We're going to get Mike and Lindsey back on another episode.
[09:21.650 --> 09:23.650]  A listener sent a Facebook message.
[09:23.650 --> 09:24.650]  You know, I wasn't even prepared for this.
[09:24.650 --> 09:26.650]  Let me grab my phone, and we'll read a Facebook message right quick.
[09:26.650 --> 09:28.650]  Yeah, that was a fun show to record.
[09:28.650 --> 09:31.650]  I got some good feedback on it from some people.
[09:31.650 --> 09:33.650]  This Facebook message stemmed from that episode.
[09:33.650 --> 09:35.650]  I'm pulling it up on my phone right now.
[09:35.650 --> 09:37.650]  This is impromptu. I was not prepared to talk.
[09:37.650 --> 09:42.650]  I was going to wait until you guys were both here, but it seems like a fair time to mention this.
[09:42.650 --> 09:43.650]  Here we go.
[09:43.650 --> 09:47.650]  This comment, she said, oh, and she has replied to my reply.
[09:47.650 --> 09:51.650]  She said, I listened to this podcast and was sad to hear that the Libertarian candidates were ignored
[09:51.650 --> 09:53.650]  or were entirely ignored.
[09:53.650 --> 09:55.650]  Gary Johnson is way better than Sanders on cannabis.
[09:55.650 --> 09:59.650]  Johnson, besides owning an extract company, even admits to using cannabis.
[09:59.650 --> 10:04.650]  So when Hillary beats Bernie, which she will, and then she leaves us a link to follow
[10:04.650 --> 10:08.650]  so that we can read about a Libertarian future.
[10:08.650 --> 10:12.650]  No, I'm very familiar with Gary Johnson.
[10:12.650 --> 10:13.650]  I'm a big fan.
[10:13.650 --> 10:16.650]  I'm just a realist.
[10:16.650 --> 10:20.650]  Gary's awesome, but Gary don't have a shot.
[10:20.650 --> 10:26.650]  She said, thanks, I'm actually rooting for Bernie for the Dem nomination, but my heart is with Gary Johnson.
[10:26.650 --> 10:30.650]  And she said, it's not totally impossible for Gary Johnson.
[10:30.650 --> 10:32.650]  So I don't know enough about that to have an opinion.
[10:32.650 --> 10:33.650]  It sounds like Mike does.
[10:33.650 --> 10:39.650]  What I do have an opinion on is that, Elizabeth, I appreciate your interaction with the podcast on Facebook.
[10:39.650 --> 10:40.650]  Keep it up.
[10:40.650 --> 10:44.650]  If you ever have any more questions or anything you'd like to say, feel free to throw it up there on the Facebook.
[10:44.650 --> 10:45.650]  I like it.
[10:45.650 --> 10:46.650]  Thank you.
[10:46.650 --> 10:54.650]  The Libertarian candidate is typically far better on marijuana policy than the Democrat or the Republican candidates,
[10:54.650 --> 10:57.650]  but they don't have a shot right now.
[10:57.650 --> 11:01.650]  Like we just don't have that third party infrastructure in the United States.
[11:01.650 --> 11:02.650]  Sorry.
[11:02.650 --> 11:03.650]  I like it.
[11:03.650 --> 11:04.650]  I didn't do it.
[11:04.650 --> 11:06.650]  Mike knows a lot of political shit.
[11:06.650 --> 11:08.650]  You're a buzzword champion, bro.
[11:08.650 --> 11:11.650]  I listened to the episode because of course I cleaned them up a little bit before I put them out.
[11:11.650 --> 11:15.650]  If anybody pauses for too long or says shit they want taken out, I'll cut it out for them.
[11:15.650 --> 11:18.650]  Listening back to that episode, you were buzzword king.
[11:18.650 --> 11:19.650]  It was like ding, ding, ding.
[11:19.650 --> 11:20.650]  You're just getting my mind every time.
[11:20.650 --> 11:21.650]  Nice.
[11:21.650 --> 11:22.650]  That's awesome.
[11:22.650 --> 11:24.650]  We talked about reclaim.
[11:24.650 --> 11:25.650]  Shout out to Rasta Seb.
[11:25.650 --> 11:27.650]  Hey, Seb, I owe you one, bro.
[11:27.650 --> 11:30.650]  You helped me out one time by contributing to the podcast.
[11:30.650 --> 11:32.650]  It looks like you may be in a time of need.
[11:32.650 --> 11:33.650]  If there's anything that Mike and I can do for you.
[11:33.650 --> 11:35.650]  Mike, I just volunteered your services to everybody.
[11:35.650 --> 11:37.650]  If we can do anything for you, bro, let me know.
[11:37.650 --> 11:39.650]  I owe you one.
[11:39.650 --> 11:42.650]  I don't know what we could do, but if something comes up that you think of, send me an email.
[11:42.650 --> 11:43.650]  Send me a Facebook message.
[11:43.650 --> 11:44.650]  We'll get it out.
[11:44.650 --> 11:48.650]  Our next article, our next topic is going to be a positive thing.
[11:48.650 --> 11:50.650]  I'm going to go to the internet for this one.
[11:50.650 --> 11:58.650]  We're actually going to play a quick video clip from Channel 13 News here in Pueblo, Colorado, and Colorado Springs.
[11:58.650 --> 12:03.650]  It says I should give credit to Katie Spencer, who is a multimedia journalist.
[12:03.650 --> 12:10.650]  The cannabis clubs in Colorado Springs united and did something great.
[12:11.650 --> 12:16.650]  They were giving away free joints to people who volunteered.
[12:16.650 --> 12:18.650]  Was this all of them or was this some of them?
[12:18.650 --> 12:19.650]  Just a small group.
[12:19.650 --> 12:20.650]  There was a group of them.
[12:20.650 --> 12:21.650]  I know.
[12:21.650 --> 12:22.650]  Okay, so there was more than one?
[12:22.650 --> 12:24.650]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was more than one.
[12:24.650 --> 12:31.650]  The article should tell us, but I saw our friends from one shop posting about it, and I saw the guy on this news article is from another shop.
[12:31.650 --> 12:35.650]  I don't know how many of the places participated, but I'll play the news article for you.
[12:35.650 --> 12:40.650]  What they did was they were giving away a free joint if you participated in their litter cleanup program.
[12:40.650 --> 12:46.650]  If you went and picked up one bag of trash and brought it back to the organizer of this event, he would give you a free joint.
[12:46.650 --> 12:48.650]  There's an image of him standing here.
[12:48.650 --> 12:52.650]  Unfortunately, he's standing in the park with a bowl of tube tubes full of joints.
[12:52.650 --> 12:53.650]  The joints aren't exposed.
[12:53.650 --> 12:54.650]  They're in little containers.
[12:54.650 --> 12:55.650]  Right.
[12:55.650 --> 13:03.650]  If I would have organized this event, it would be organized slightly different, but I love it for what it is and what it did for the community.
[13:03.650 --> 13:04.650]  It's a very good idea.
[13:04.650 --> 13:12.650]  It's not 100% put your best foot forward necessarily as far as optics go, but I love it.
[13:12.650 --> 13:16.650]  Do joints for picking up trash all the way.
[13:16.650 --> 13:17.650]  Clean everything up.
[13:17.650 --> 13:20.650]  I wonder if you could smoke the joint while you pick up trash because that would make it a lot better.
[13:20.650 --> 13:22.650]  Sure, it would.
[13:22.650 --> 13:23.650]  No, you can't do that, though.
[13:23.650 --> 13:24.650]  Not legally in Colorado.
[13:24.650 --> 13:27.650]  Yeah, that's the whole thing with handing them out because I'm sure plenty of people did that.
[13:27.650 --> 13:30.650]  It was just bring me a bag of trash, get a joint.
[13:30.650 --> 13:33.650]  I'm sure there were plenty of people who brought him several bags of trash.
[13:33.650 --> 13:35.650]  I wonder how many people went and cleaned out their car.
[13:35.650 --> 13:43.650]  I hope not many, but I'd like to see more of the industry doing stuff like that.
[13:43.650 --> 13:49.650]  The consumption clubs can really push the boundaries with giving away product and stuff like that.
[13:49.650 --> 13:51.650]  The shops can't even give away product legally.
[13:51.650 --> 13:53.650]  They have to charge at least a penny.
[13:53.650 --> 13:54.650]  Right.
[13:54.650 --> 14:01.650]  The only way a dispensary would be able to do that would to be if they checked your ID before they let you sign up for the program, and then they would have to give you a coupon.
[14:02.650 --> 14:05.650]  They may give you a joint for a penny because they can't give you anything for free.
[14:05.650 --> 14:06.650]  Right.
[14:06.650 --> 14:10.650]  Then you'd have to go back to that shop and get the joint for a penny with your coupon.
[14:10.650 --> 14:14.650]  But then didn't you just technically, you're employed by that dispensary if that happens.
[14:14.650 --> 14:16.650]  You're like kind of. . .
[14:16.650 --> 14:18.650]  Not really because they're just handing out coupons.
[14:18.650 --> 14:28.650]  Who they hand coupons to, I don't know if you could claim that's employment, but I'm sure that a stink would get raised if a dispensary actually did that.
[14:28.650 --> 14:31.650]  Oh, yeah. Too many hoops to jump through for the dispensary.
[14:31.650 --> 14:32.650]  Nobody would take tax money on it.
[14:32.650 --> 14:33.650]  Right.
[14:33.650 --> 14:35.650]  All sorts of things.
[14:35.650 --> 14:39.650]  Well, the shop would have to pay the taxes on that as though it's sold at normal price.
[14:39.650 --> 14:43.650]  I bet would be the bite that the shop would have to take.
[14:43.650 --> 14:53.650]  But there's a shop down here that's adopted a strip of highway, and I drive that strip of highway every day, and it's always fucking filthy, and I shake my head every time I drive and see that sign.
[14:53.650 --> 14:55.650]  So they need to get out there and clean it up.
[14:55.650 --> 14:56.650]  They really do.
[14:56.650 --> 14:59.650]  They're a little redheaded stepchild part of the highway is all dirty.
[14:59.650 --> 15:00.650]  Yep.
[15:00.650 --> 15:03.650]  Get out there and fulfill your obligation.
[15:03.650 --> 15:07.650]  And shout out to the consumption clubs that did this event.
[15:07.650 --> 15:14.650]  I wish more of the industry was thinking of stuff like this to help clean up or better their little part of the community.
[15:14.650 --> 15:16.650]  All right. I'm going to play the video.
[15:16.650 --> 15:17.650]  I got to get the volumes correct.
[15:17.650 --> 15:19.650]  I apologize if things go wonky here.
[15:19.650 --> 15:23.650]  I don't know how loud this is going to be because it is coming from the News 13 website.
[15:23.650 --> 15:24.650]  We'll deal with it. Here we go.
[15:24.650 --> 15:30.650]  Colorado Springs Cannabis Club offering free marijuana today to those who helped pick up trash.
[15:30.650 --> 15:36.650]  Dozens of volunteers showed up to help the Pothole Cannabis Club clean up Vermeho Park and other areas.
[15:36.650 --> 15:39.650]  And KRDO News Channel 13's Katie Spencer tagged along.
[15:39.650 --> 15:40.650]  It's new at 5 o'clock.
[15:42.650 --> 15:48.650]  The goal of Sunday's get-together? Making Colorado Springs more beautiful one trash bag at a time.
[15:49.650 --> 15:55.650]  We're going to go out here on the west side and clean up down here off of Simran and the park off of 26th.
[15:55.650 --> 16:02.650]  The effort started here at Vermeho Park where volunteers were picking up trash for a unique reward.
[16:02.650 --> 16:07.650]  As you bring bags of trash back to me, I'm going to give you a joint per bag you bring back.
[16:07.650 --> 16:11.650]  But for those cleaning up, it wasn't just about the free weed.
[16:11.650 --> 16:16.650]  I hike every single day and I see trash on every single trail and it saddens me.
[16:16.650 --> 16:19.650]  It was a personal connection to their home.
[16:19.650 --> 16:26.650]  So it feels good to actually go pick the trash up. I don't mind it because I use the trail.
[16:26.650 --> 16:31.650]  Cleaning up the park as well as the reputation of the marijuana industry.
[16:31.650 --> 16:37.650]  To show that we are a positive impact. There's nothing wrong with weed and there's nothing wrong with our kind of people.
[16:37.650 --> 16:42.650]  In Colorado Springs, Katie Spencer, KRDO News Channel 13.
[16:42.650 --> 16:44.650]  They picked up a lot of trash.
[16:44.650 --> 16:48.650]  The club hopes to continue the cleanups every month and move to other parts of the city.
[16:48.650 --> 16:52.650]  So every month that would be cool to see people picking up trash for pot.
[16:52.650 --> 16:57.650]  So that shows you guys we're not just a bunch of lazy stoners. We do contribute to the community.
[16:57.650 --> 17:00.650]  We want it to be cleaner. We're at the park chilling out enjoying our buzz.
[17:00.650 --> 17:03.650]  We want it to be clean. We don't want to look around and see trash everywhere.
[17:03.650 --> 17:09.650]  There's this weird myth out there that because we're associated with marijuana,
[17:09.650 --> 17:14.650]  we want everything to be bad and destroyed and stoned.
[17:14.650 --> 17:19.650]  We're like bad people and it's just nonsense. We're people just like everybody else.
[17:19.650 --> 17:21.650]  We like cannabis too.
[17:21.650 --> 17:28.650]  One thing I've noticed being around potheads a lot for the past 20 years is a lot of them have OCD.
[17:28.650 --> 17:32.650]  I may sound sexist but this is just what I've observed.
[17:32.650 --> 17:36.650]  A lot of women get gotta clean some shit OCD.
[17:36.650 --> 17:39.650]  They're stoned and they're like, oh those dishes are dirty. Fuck all that.
[17:39.650 --> 17:41.650]  And they just go clean the dishes.
[17:41.650 --> 17:44.650]  It's just because in their mind, those dishes can't be dirty. It's driving me crazy.
[17:44.650 --> 17:46.650]  So they do the damn dishes.
[17:46.650 --> 17:48.650]  And potheads get the same OCD.
[17:48.650 --> 17:51.650]  They're like, there's trash everywhere. I gotta pick it up. Make my environment look good.
[17:51.650 --> 17:53.650]  It's just easier and more comfortable.
[17:53.650 --> 17:55.650]  I was a Boy Scout back in the day.
[17:55.650 --> 17:59.650]  It was important to the people around me that when we went camping,
[17:59.650 --> 18:05.650]  not only did we do zero impact camping or leave no trace camping,
[18:05.650 --> 18:09.650]  but we'd actively pay attention and grab other trash while we were out there.
[18:09.650 --> 18:14.650]  We always had one pocket full of other people's bullshit on the way back to camp at night
[18:14.650 --> 18:18.650]  just so that next time we were up there, it was a little better than it was this time.
[18:18.650 --> 18:22.650]  And I do it at my house too.
[18:22.650 --> 18:24.650]  It's been crazy windy down here.
[18:24.650 --> 18:28.650]  So every night when I get home, I spend two minutes picking up other people's trash out of my front yard.
[18:28.650 --> 18:30.650]  We should put up a net.
[18:30.650 --> 18:31.650]  We really should.
[18:31.650 --> 18:34.650]  The past few days we've needed it. A trash net would be really helpful.
[18:34.650 --> 18:36.650]  I want to give a shout out to Four Pieces.
[18:36.650 --> 18:38.650]  Make sure you follow at Four Pieces on Instagram.
[18:38.650 --> 18:41.650]  I'm not sure their website and stuff, but if you check them out on Instagram,
[18:41.650 --> 18:46.650]  Four Pieces is an organization that encourages you to pick up four pieces of trash per day.
[18:46.650 --> 18:48.650]  It doesn't matter where you find them.
[18:48.650 --> 18:51.650]  Well, it kind of does. You don't want to go take them out of the dumpster or some shit.
[18:51.650 --> 18:53.650]  But I mean, do your part. Pick up four pieces of trash per day.
[18:53.650 --> 18:55.650]  Take a picture of it. Post it up on Four Pieces.
[18:55.650 --> 18:58.650]  Encourage other people to pick up four pieces of trash.
[18:58.650 --> 19:02.650]  I'm continuously blown away by shit I see out in the public.
[19:02.650 --> 19:05.650]  What's this Starbucks cup doing in my parking lot?
[19:05.650 --> 19:07.650]  It wasn't there 20 minutes ago.
[19:07.650 --> 19:09.650]  I go on hikes and I find the weirdest shit on hikes.
[19:09.650 --> 19:14.650]  I'll be far from the car or wherever there is. I'm far from it.
[19:14.650 --> 19:18.650]  I'm like, how did people bring a fucking pie and some forks out here?
[19:18.650 --> 19:19.650]  What were these people doing?
[19:19.650 --> 19:21.650]  Why couldn't they just take their pie container back?
[19:21.650 --> 19:22.650]  Right.
[19:22.650 --> 19:24.650]  Pie container and a bunch of plastic forks.
[19:24.650 --> 19:26.650]  I found a stop sign out in the middle of nowhere one time.
[19:26.650 --> 19:28.650]  Just cleaning all shit up.
[19:28.650 --> 19:29.650]  People are weird.
[19:29.650 --> 19:31.650]  We are way off on a tangent here.
[19:31.650 --> 19:33.650]  I don't even know how we ended up in this place.
[19:33.650 --> 19:36.650]  No, the news article, picking up trash for joints.
[19:36.650 --> 19:37.650]  It's a great idea.
[19:37.650 --> 19:41.650]  I just, yeah, think it all the way through, please.
[19:41.650 --> 19:42.650]  Yeah.
[19:42.650 --> 19:44.650]  Let's not give out the joints in the park next time.
[19:44.650 --> 19:46.650]  That looked a little weird on the news there.
[19:46.650 --> 19:47.650]  Right.
[19:47.650 --> 19:50.650]  That's the one thing that everybody sort of has against the consumption clubs
[19:50.650 --> 19:56.650]  is that some of them have found a way to do some sort of distribution.
[19:57.650 --> 20:01.650]  And we're giving joints away in the park for bringing us bags of trash.
[20:01.650 --> 20:03.650]  Like, that's an awesome program.
[20:03.650 --> 20:04.650]  Dude, getting people to clean up trash.
[20:04.650 --> 20:05.650]  I don't care how you do it.
[20:05.650 --> 20:10.650]  I'm going to jump in and interrupt you and do my part for the consumption clubs.
[20:10.650 --> 20:12.650]  I'm going to avoid the word distribution.
[20:12.650 --> 20:13.650]  Sorry.
[20:13.650 --> 20:16.650]  We would much rather hear the word reimbursement.
[20:16.650 --> 20:20.650]  And I'm just educating you and our listeners so that if you guys come to a consumption club,
[20:20.650 --> 20:23.650]  don't say purchase, don't say buy.
[20:23.650 --> 20:27.650]  Say, may I reimburse you for some of that fine quality product there?
[20:27.650 --> 20:30.650]  Like, reimbursement is the key word in these places.
[20:30.650 --> 20:33.650]  And this is why it's important all you fuckers vote.
[20:33.650 --> 20:34.650]  I'm sick of word games.
[20:34.650 --> 20:36.650]  You just call them all fuckers.
[20:36.650 --> 20:38.650]  We're just talking about head shops.
[20:38.650 --> 20:39.650]  I'm sorry, guys.
[20:39.650 --> 20:40.650]  We didn't mean it.
[20:40.650 --> 20:47.650]  Yeah, we're just talking about how some head shops in Colorado are still playing the water pipe game because they have to.
[20:47.650 --> 20:49.650]  And it's just nonsense.
[20:50.650 --> 20:53.650]  And it's because enough of our generation isn't voting regularly yet.
[20:53.650 --> 20:54.650]  The water pipe game.
[20:54.650 --> 20:56.650]  I want to define the water pipe game because some people might not.
[20:56.650 --> 21:02.650]  Oh, when you come into my marijuana store, I'm happy to show you the bongs on my shelf and tell you how much my bongs cost.
[21:02.650 --> 21:10.650]  But if the head shop up the road shows you the exact same thing, they're not allowed to call it a bong because if it's a bong, it might be used for marijuana.
[21:10.650 --> 21:14.650]  And if it's used for marijuana, it's not really legal, legal to sell.
[21:15.650 --> 21:19.650]  It's still against federal law because you called it a bong.
[21:19.650 --> 21:21.650]  Yeah, it's 2016.
[21:21.650 --> 21:23.650]  We should be able to say, can I check out that bong?
[21:23.650 --> 21:26.650]  It really, really is 2016.
[21:26.650 --> 21:27.650]  It's actually 2016.
[21:27.650 --> 21:29.650]  You should be saying, can I get that rig?
[21:29.650 --> 21:30.650]  Right.
[21:30.650 --> 21:31.650]  I'm sick of the word games.
[21:31.650 --> 21:32.650]  It's legal in Colorado now.
[21:32.650 --> 21:35.650]  And there are still places where you have to say water pipe.
[21:36.650 --> 21:44.650]  And I'm a huge advocate for consumption clubs and learning another word game makes that harder.
[21:44.650 --> 21:50.650]  Well, that segues into my next news article because you said consumption clubs and you're a big fan.
[21:50.650 --> 21:55.650]  But this article says this is from the Indy, the Colorado Springs Independent.
[21:55.650 --> 21:56.650]  It was by Nat Stein.
[21:56.650 --> 22:01.650]  The article headline says City Council bans cannabis clubs knowing full well lawsuit is coming.
[22:02.650 --> 22:09.650]  And this is shocking news because just a few days ago we were told they had eight years to get their shit together to recoup their investments.
[22:09.650 --> 22:10.650]  It was a really weird decision.
[22:10.650 --> 22:14.650]  They're too dangerous to be open, but they have eight years to recoup their expenses.
[22:14.650 --> 22:16.650]  Like, well, which is it?
[22:16.650 --> 22:19.650]  So the article goes a little bit like this.
[22:19.650 --> 22:20.650]  Nice trying to hide that.
[22:20.650 --> 22:21.650]  I heard that real well.
[22:21.650 --> 22:22.650]  Trying to cover that up.
[22:22.650 --> 22:24.650]  Those Mountain Dew cans are fucking fierce.
[22:24.650 --> 22:27.650]  You just, you call them fuckers and cheers, bitches.
[22:27.650 --> 22:28.650]  Yep.
[22:28.650 --> 22:29.650]  You're having a great night, bro.
[22:29.650 --> 22:30.650]  I'm in a rare form tonight.
[22:30.650 --> 22:31.650]  Dude, I drink this whole.
[22:31.650 --> 22:32.650]  It's like one in the morning.
[22:32.650 --> 22:35.650]  I'm just glad to be getting the show recorded at all.
[22:35.650 --> 22:36.650]  Gingerade kombucha.
[22:36.650 --> 22:38.650]  And I don't know.
[22:38.650 --> 22:40.650]  There might, I might, I don't know.
[22:40.650 --> 22:41.650]  I feel strange from it.
[22:41.650 --> 22:42.650]  I'm not going to say there's alcohol in there.
[22:42.650 --> 22:46.650]  Like every time you drink, I see random things floating in the bottom of it.
[22:46.650 --> 22:47.650]  That's kombucha.
[22:47.650 --> 22:50.650]  I think I have a nice little kombucha buzz going on to tell you the truth.
[22:50.650 --> 22:51.650]  Anyway, this article goes like this.
[22:51.650 --> 22:56.650]  A marathon session at City Hall on Tuesday featured City Council dissenters of all stripes.
[22:56.650 --> 23:01.650]  Those who pushed back on Councilor Andy Pico's proposed resolution opposing refugee settlement.
[23:01.650 --> 23:05.650]  Those who delivered a petition demanding repeal of the recently enacted Pedestrian Access Act.
[23:05.650 --> 23:09.650]  Those who bemoaned the promos land swap deal with the Broadmoor.
[23:09.650 --> 23:13.650]  And finally, those pleading once again for council to keep the cannabis clubs unshuttered.
[23:13.650 --> 23:18.650]  None of that resolved except for the club issue, but not in a way most had urged.
[23:18.650 --> 23:23.650]  The clubs, which were membership-based social clubs that allow for adult marijuana use,
[23:24.650 --> 23:27.650]  have caused consternation for city officials for several years now.
[23:27.650 --> 23:31.650]  They first started springing up after voter-approved Amendment 64.
[23:31.650 --> 23:40.650]  In 2014, Studio A64 won a zoning violation appeal in which the city granted the downtown club a similar use determination.
[23:40.650 --> 23:45.650]  In essence, saying that cannabis clubs are like social clubs, so are areas zoned as such.
[23:45.650 --> 23:51.650]  And then in parentheses it says permitted in multifamily, residential, commercial, and industrial zone districts.
[23:51.650 --> 23:58.650]  More clubs opened up all over town, even after the six-month moratorium on new marijuana business licensing began in September.
[23:58.650 --> 24:02.650]  The city couldn't stop issuing a license that did not exist.
[24:02.650 --> 24:06.650]  Then, earlier this month, the Planning Commission recommended banning the clubs outright.
[24:06.650 --> 24:11.650]  Councilor Don Knight took the ordinance to council proposing the group prohibit the opening of any new clubs,
[24:11.650 --> 24:17.650]  mandate licensure for all clubs that operated prior to the moratorium, subject to all sorts of new rules,
[24:17.650 --> 24:20.650]  and force those clubs to close doors after eight years.
[24:20.650 --> 24:24.650]  This is the ordinance council gave a final reading on Tuesday.
[24:24.650 --> 24:34.650]  Councilor Bill Murray moved to the table the ordinance for six months so council could work with the industry to develop more moderate regulations.
[24:34.650 --> 24:38.650]  In the end, council voted 6-3 in favor of adopting Knight's original proposal.
[24:38.650 --> 24:43.650]  Councilors Jill Gabler and Helen Collins joined Murray in voting no.
[24:43.650 --> 24:48.650]  We talk about limited government all the time, but limited government is not about number of employees.
[24:48.650 --> 24:50.650]  It's about limited laws, Murray said.
[24:50.650 --> 24:53.650]  We're turning democracy into a morality play.
[24:53.650 --> 24:59.650]  Gabler said she was skeptical of the public process behind the measure, or lack thereof.
[24:59.650 --> 25:03.650]  Collins, on her part, said she didn't think a ban would be constitutional.
[25:03.650 --> 25:11.650]  Knight and Councilor Keith King both argued that council had already exercised its right under Amendment 64 to opt out of the retail side of marijuana.
[25:12.650 --> 25:15.650]  Knight cited articles from the Gazette and Fox News as proof.
[25:15.650 --> 25:23.650]  Those articles highlight the club's practice of offering marijuana to patients who didn't bring their own, sometimes in exchange for a donation or reimbursement.
[25:23.650 --> 25:29.650]  Assisting other adults in the use of marijuana is permissible under Act 64, is what this article says.
[25:29.650 --> 25:32.650]  This article is written in two different colors, so I apologize for my stutter.
[25:32.650 --> 25:34.650]  It makes my eyes jump around when it's in two colors like that.
[25:34.650 --> 25:36.650]  Don't do that if you type some shit. That's rude.
[25:37.650 --> 25:42.650]  Club owners and goers took their opportunity during basic public comment to try and correct some misconceptions.
[25:42.650 --> 25:49.650]  Amber Rasick, owner of Studio A64, insisted that cannabis clubs are benign relative to bars that serve alcohol.
[25:49.650 --> 25:57.650]  She says, I get off at 1 a.m. in the morning, and every time I drive downtown, I see people outside the bars stumbling around, causing problems, getting into fights.
[25:57.650 --> 26:00.650]  We are peaceful people, she said.
[26:00.650 --> 26:03.650]  All we want is a place to be accepted as human beings.
[26:03.650 --> 26:07.650]  Weed is how we choose to relax, and it isn't hurting one. It's our right.
[26:07.650 --> 26:13.650]  Presence Mercier, I hope I said that right, patron and cousin of a local club owner, took a different tack.
[26:13.650 --> 26:17.650]  Even if you hate pot, that's fine, she said, but we all love money, right?
[26:17.650 --> 26:19.650]  Think about what you'd gain from these clubs.
[26:19.650 --> 26:24.650]  And that's such a good point. I mean, that's kind of a tasteless way to say it, but I mean, it's the truth.
[26:24.650 --> 26:27.650]  Think about all the money that you're going to miss out on if they close all of these clubs.
[26:27.650 --> 26:28.650]  Yep.
[26:28.650 --> 26:36.650]  Shutting down a bunch of businesses, I mean, you lose a lot more than the sales tax, payroll tax, property tax, business tax.
[26:36.650 --> 26:39.650]  And then all of the money that those employees go spend back in your community?
[26:39.650 --> 26:45.650]  I mean, and all of this is silly. Like, there are places in the world that already have these clubs zoned and regulated.
[26:45.650 --> 26:47.650]  Pueblo County happens to be one of them.
[26:49.650 --> 26:53.650]  It's just Colorado Springs isn't one, so they're pretending like it's impossible.
[26:54.650 --> 27:01.650]  And because they're refusing to throw rules down and just be like, all right, follow these, apply here and be done with it.
[27:01.650 --> 27:04.650]  They're going to be doing this nonsense for the next half decade.
[27:04.650 --> 27:11.650]  They need to figure out that loophole of how people can reimburse the club for the product that they use there.
[27:11.650 --> 27:12.650]  Right.
[27:12.650 --> 27:14.650]  That is the only, that seems to be the...
[27:14.650 --> 27:17.650]  Or like the club has to have a way to survive.
[27:18.650 --> 27:19.650]  Very true.
[27:19.650 --> 27:28.650]  And right now, a lot of the rules that are in place are like they can't do anything other than sell prepackaged drinks and snacks.
[27:29.650 --> 27:35.650]  Like you can't even do like cold sandwiches, let alone like decent food.
[27:36.650 --> 27:37.650]  It's just nuts.
[27:38.650 --> 27:41.650]  No way to reimburse for the product.
[27:43.650 --> 27:44.650]  How do you pay your rent at that point?
[27:44.650 --> 27:46.650]  Right. How do you exist as an entity?
[27:46.650 --> 27:47.650]  Yeah.
[27:48.650 --> 27:51.650]  I mean, how far out in the middle of nowhere do they want to push it?
[27:51.650 --> 27:54.650]  Like eventually it's just going to be like at like cousin Earl's farm.
[27:54.650 --> 27:59.650]  And then that's pointless. We just need, we like having a place in the congregating area.
[27:59.650 --> 28:06.650]  Some dude with 50 acres and a big house and a barn in the middle of it's going to slap up and out on the internet.
[28:06.650 --> 28:08.650]  To be honest, I've been in those situations.
[28:08.650 --> 28:11.650]  I've been out in the middle of nowhere smoking because we had to hide.
[28:11.650 --> 28:15.650]  I've been to gatherings in every environment you can imagine.
[28:15.650 --> 28:20.650]  You know what I mean? From some random dude's house to some hippie's house to some gangster's house.
[28:20.650 --> 28:22.650]  I've been in every environment smoking.
[28:22.650 --> 28:25.650]  And those social clubs are the ideal safest environment.
[28:25.650 --> 28:28.650]  Nothing's going to go wrong. I'm not on somebody's turf.
[28:28.650 --> 28:30.650]  I'm in a club. Come on, hang out.
[28:30.650 --> 28:32.650]  You paid the entry fee. You showed us your ID.
[28:32.650 --> 28:34.650]  You're part of our club. We don't have anything against you.
[28:34.650 --> 28:36.650]  Nobody here is in a different club.
[28:36.650 --> 28:38.650]  Come hang out. Let's smoke.
[28:38.650 --> 28:45.650]  There's a video that I saw years and years ago where they're interviewing a coffee shop owner in Amsterdam.
[28:45.650 --> 28:48.650]  And that's what the consumption clubs in Amsterdam are called.
[28:48.650 --> 28:53.650]  And he says he's been open for like 15 years and he goes, there's never been a fight in here.
[28:53.650 --> 28:56.650]  He goes, the bar across the street, the police are there every night.
[28:56.650 --> 28:57.650]  Every night.
[28:57.650 --> 29:02.650]  And I mean, it's just a different, it's a different type of intoxicant.
[29:02.650 --> 29:05.650]  It doesn't come with that aggressive tinge.
[29:06.650 --> 29:11.650]  I see anti-pop people linking, like anytime there's a violent incident and marijuana gets mentioned,
[29:11.650 --> 29:15.650]  like they post it up as though it was directly caused by it.
[29:15.650 --> 29:18.650]  And it's like, well, then you wouldn't have had to go to Texas to find this story.
[29:18.650 --> 29:21.650]  Like your town sold $17 million worth of weed last year.
[29:21.650 --> 29:25.650]  Like if it was being caused, you could link that article from Pueblo.
[29:25.650 --> 29:33.650]  But the problems with the clubs are just, they annoy people that really, really hate marijuana.
[29:33.650 --> 29:38.650]  And that's the biggest problem caused by allowing consumption clubs is that you annoy the squeaky wheel.
[29:38.650 --> 29:41.650]  I'll give it a few years.
[29:41.650 --> 29:42.650]  They're old.
[29:42.650 --> 29:43.650]  There's never been a problem.
[29:43.650 --> 29:46.650]  There's never been any trouble there.
[29:46.650 --> 29:47.650]  All right.
[29:47.650 --> 29:48.650]  I'm going to continue with this article.
[29:48.650 --> 29:51.650]  Joking that being from Denver shouldn't be held against him.
[29:51.650 --> 29:56.650]  Activist attorney Rob Corey reminded council that amendment 64, which he had a hand in drafting,
[29:56.650 --> 29:58.650]  protects the activities in question.
[29:58.650 --> 30:01.650]  In Colorado, adults have the right to associate with each other, consume marijuana,
[30:01.650 --> 30:05.650]  cultivate it, distribute it, and help others with all of those things.
[30:05.650 --> 30:07.650]  He said, that's the supreme law of the land.
[30:07.650 --> 30:09.650]  The voters have spoken.
[30:09.650 --> 30:13.650]  And just like the other constitutional rights, which council members swore to uphold,
[30:13.650 --> 30:17.650]  the rights afforded by amendment 20 and amendment 64 are non-negotiable, Corey said.
[30:17.650 --> 30:21.650]  That may be difficult for you, but that is the reality.
[30:21.650 --> 30:26.650]  Jill Gaber asked Corey how other municipalities in the state are dealing with cannabis clubs.
[30:26.650 --> 30:29.650]  Not a single one has banned them because they can't, he answered.
[30:29.650 --> 30:33.650]  Plus a city devoid of venues for social consumption creates other problems, he explained.
[30:33.650 --> 30:37.650]  Marijuana will be smoked by adults in groups no matter what you do.
[30:37.650 --> 30:41.650]  You can't prevent me from inviting 50 of my closest friends over to smoke pot together.
[30:41.650 --> 30:43.650]  So where are they going to go?
[30:43.650 --> 30:45.650]  Coming soon to a neighborhood near you.
[30:45.650 --> 30:46.650]  Yep.
[30:46.650 --> 30:47.650]  Right?
[30:47.650 --> 30:49.650]  Yeah, if they ban the clubs, we'll just open the front door, bro.
[30:49.650 --> 30:51.650]  Just come on, everybody and everywhere.
[30:51.650 --> 30:53.650]  Come just take some dabs in my house.
[30:53.650 --> 30:56.650]  We're going to start dabbing with some really interesting people.
[30:56.650 --> 30:57.650]  We go that route.
[30:57.650 --> 30:59.650]  Well, that's part of the beauty of the club.
[30:59.650 --> 31:02.650]  I love that because I would go to the club once or twice a week.
[31:02.650 --> 31:04.650]  I would make an effort to show up once a week or so.
[31:04.650 --> 31:07.650]  Honestly, it got to about once every two weeks during trim time because we were just busy.
[31:07.650 --> 31:11.650]  But once or twice a week, I'll pop in there and try to spend an hour there and say hi to people.
[31:11.650 --> 31:13.650]  And I would always meet new people.
[31:13.650 --> 31:16.650]  And sometimes I'd meet people that I wish would walk away.
[31:16.650 --> 31:20.650]  But most of the time I would meet people that are like, damn, I'm glad I'm friends with that guy now.
[31:20.650 --> 31:21.650]  Yep.
[31:21.650 --> 31:25.650]  That's, I like most of the people I've met in the community.
[31:25.650 --> 31:28.650]  And I wish I could spend more time with the consumption clubs.
[31:28.650 --> 31:31.650]  And I haven't felt that way about a bar in forever.
[31:31.650 --> 31:37.650]  But the gray area they exist in just annoys the shit out of me at this point in time.
[31:37.650 --> 31:39.650]  Absolutely.
[31:39.650 --> 31:42.650]  It's just ridiculous at this point.
[31:42.650 --> 31:46.650]  And that the more people don't see this ridiculous is starting to really annoy me.
[31:46.650 --> 31:49.650]  Yeah, why can we, yeah, I've said this so many times.
[31:49.650 --> 31:51.650]  Why can we have so many bars but we can't have somewhere to smoke cannabis?
[31:51.650 --> 31:52.650]  It seems unfair.
[31:52.650 --> 31:54.650]  And they voted to regulate it like cannabis.
[31:54.650 --> 32:03.650]  The retort that I always get for that is, well, you can enjoy one alcoholic beverage without getting any sort of intoxication.
[32:03.650 --> 32:07.650]  But every time you consume cannabis, it's to get high.
[32:07.650 --> 32:11.650]  And it's like, well, sort of.
[32:11.650 --> 32:14.650]  But you can also consume a small amount of cannabis and get no high.
[32:14.650 --> 32:15.650]  I do it all the time.
[32:15.650 --> 32:21.650]  I do it consuming large amounts of cannabis products when I'm consuming straight CBD stuff.
[32:21.650 --> 32:23.650]  My first couple of dabs.
[32:24.650 --> 32:26.650]  That's just, that's medicine.
[32:26.650 --> 32:32.650]  For medical consumers like you and me, like one or two high THC dabs, there's still no intoxication.
[32:32.650 --> 32:34.650]  That's just all sort of pain kill.
[32:34.650 --> 32:37.650]  It's different for everybody.
[32:37.650 --> 32:51.650]  And to make that argument as though most people don't go to the bar for more than one drink or to feel some sort of ease, relief of stress or blow off some steam or get a nice buzz.
[32:52.650 --> 32:56.650]  Like I've been aware of the phrase three martini lunch since I was like five.
[32:56.650 --> 33:00.650]  It's just a nonsense argument.
[33:00.650 --> 33:07.650]  But I hear it day after day from elected officials, people in suits, people whose opinions being printed in the newspaper.
[33:07.650 --> 33:09.650]  And it's just nonsense.
[33:09.650 --> 33:10.650]  And it's unfair.
[33:10.650 --> 33:16.650]  How come you guys have somewhere to hang out and congregate and drink one drink and I don't have somewhere to hang out and congregate and take one dab?
[33:16.650 --> 33:17.650]  Right.
[33:17.650 --> 33:18.650]  It's the same damn thing.
[33:18.650 --> 33:19.650]  All right.
[33:19.650 --> 33:20.650]  One more paragraph.
[33:20.650 --> 33:32.650]  It says at the end of his testimony, Corey made a show of delivering the IC attorney a draft lawsuit he intends to file as soon as the mayor signs the club ban ordinance on behalf of nine clubs and 14 individuals who own or operate those clubs.
[33:33.650 --> 33:50.650]  The complaint asked for the ordinance to be struck down for violating plaintiff's rights of association, freedom of speech and due process under the US Constitution, as well as their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, religious freedom and right to medical and personal use of marijuana under Colorado Constitution.
[33:50.650 --> 33:52.650]  Counselor Knight took exception to the claim.
[33:52.650 --> 33:54.650]  The council has no right to ban cannabis clubs.
[33:54.650 --> 33:58.650]  We will talk about that in court, Corey said.
[33:58.650 --> 34:00.650]  Yeah.
[34:00.650 --> 34:07.650]  So with this happened, they had four days to draft the new rules and have the city attorney sign them is what I was told.
[34:07.650 --> 34:09.650]  And that should have happened.
[34:09.650 --> 34:11.650]  I think the day for that signing would be today.
[34:11.650 --> 34:18.650]  And as soon as that was signed, as this story is still developing, as soon as the paper was signed is when the law suit went into.
[34:18.650 --> 34:21.650]  So it's the 27th is when the paper will be signed.
[34:21.650 --> 34:24.650]  And that's when the lawsuit will kick in is what I think I was told.
[34:24.650 --> 34:26.650]  It'll be interesting to watch this one play out.
[34:26.650 --> 34:27.650]  It sure will.
[34:27.650 --> 34:28.650]  I do.
[34:28.650 --> 34:30.650]  I don't want these clubs to get closed.
[34:30.650 --> 34:32.650]  I want to be able to go hang out.
[34:32.650 --> 34:35.650]  Like we have rules for them down here.
[34:35.650 --> 34:40.650]  It's just none of them are open because essentially the rules mean it's going to be a huge upfront investment.
[34:40.650 --> 34:50.650]  And the rules also mean they've got to make that investment back with a quarter profit apiece on like prepackaged bags of chips and bottled water.
[34:50.650 --> 34:51.650]  It's insane.
[34:51.650 --> 34:52.650]  Yeah.
[34:52.650 --> 34:53.650]  And those buildings are expensive.
[34:54.650 --> 34:55.650]  Yep.
[34:55.650 --> 34:58.650]  That part of most parts of Colorado Springs right now are really expensive.
[34:58.650 --> 34:59.650]  All right.
[34:59.650 --> 35:01.650]  So I've got one more news article I want to talk about.
[35:01.650 --> 35:03.650]  Oh, I want to mention something.
[35:03.650 --> 35:06.650]  Everybody was reading a CBD article from Facebook.
[35:06.650 --> 35:07.650]  Everybody was sharing it.
[35:07.650 --> 35:09.650]  That article was a hoax, you guys.
[35:09.650 --> 35:11.650]  It got all of us riled up.
[35:11.650 --> 35:13.650]  I was looking at it a little further.
[35:13.650 --> 35:16.650]  And that actual article was a hoax.
[35:16.650 --> 35:20.650]  99% of it's a hoax.
[35:20.650 --> 35:22.650]  It's based on a truth, though.
[35:22.650 --> 35:26.650]  The FDA did send out warning letters to different CBD companies.
[35:26.650 --> 35:33.650]  But it was my understanding that a lot of them were the ones you and me were warning people about a couple of months back.
[35:33.650 --> 35:34.650]  Right.
[35:34.650 --> 35:38.650]  The Chinese nonsense companies that are like, two drops of this will cure your cancer.
[35:38.650 --> 35:39.650]  It's pure CBD.
[35:39.650 --> 35:42.650]  And then they test it and it's pure codfish oil or some shit.
[35:42.650 --> 35:43.650]  Right.
[35:43.650 --> 35:51.650]  Well, I read an article on Facebook that was saying that the FDA sent out a letter saying that all CBD products were banned because it was now FDA regulated.
[35:51.650 --> 35:52.650]  Right.
[35:52.650 --> 35:53.650]  That was not true.
[35:53.650 --> 35:54.650]  That was a hoax.
[35:54.650 --> 35:55.650]  So if you guys saw that, don't panic.
[35:55.650 --> 35:56.650]  That shit was bullshit.
[35:56.650 --> 35:58.650]  It may come down the pipeline in the future.
[35:58.650 --> 36:00.650]  But as of this time, that was a hoax.
[36:00.650 --> 36:01.650]  That was clickbait.
[36:01.650 --> 36:02.650]  People were trying to get you to click.
[36:02.650 --> 36:03.650]  And I bought the bait.
[36:03.650 --> 36:05.650]  When I read it, I was like, this isn't written well.
[36:05.650 --> 36:06.650]  It doesn't look right.
[36:06.650 --> 36:07.650]  I need to do some research.
[36:07.650 --> 36:08.650]  It wasn't true.
[36:08.650 --> 36:19.650]  So in a few episodes ago, continuingly, we've been talking about a raid that happened in Santa Ana, California, when some police officers raided a dispensary that was open and full of customers.
[36:20.650 --> 36:27.650]  If you don't know which raid we're talking about, hit pause real quick and Google Santa Ana police dispensary raid.
[36:27.650 --> 36:28.650]  Yes.
[36:28.650 --> 36:30.650]  And that should bring the video right up.
[36:30.650 --> 36:34.650]  So these cops were caught on camera destroying this dispensary.
[36:34.650 --> 36:38.650]  They ate what I thought was edibles on camera, but this article covers a little bit.
[36:38.650 --> 36:40.650]  It tries to back them up a little bit on that.
[36:40.650 --> 36:41.650]  I can't say that they were eating edibles.
[36:41.650 --> 36:42.650]  I wasn't there.
[36:42.650 --> 36:44.650]  This article kind of defends them.
[36:44.650 --> 36:49.650]  The headline says Santa Ana cops in notorious pot eating video charged with petty theft and vandalism.
[36:49.650 --> 36:51.650]  The article is by Nick shoe.
[36:51.650 --> 36:52.650]  So I'm going to say it.
[36:52.650 --> 36:57.650]  If the headline calls it the pot eating video, we can go ahead and be solid on.
[36:57.650 --> 36:59.650]  Yeah, it looked like they were eating edibles in the video.
[36:59.650 --> 37:02.650]  I would still say those were edibles.
[37:02.650 --> 37:03.650]  It was edible something.
[37:03.650 --> 37:07.650]  They were the most articles from the OC weekly on.
[37:07.650 --> 37:08.650]  So it goes like this.
[37:08.650 --> 37:23.650]  The Orange County district attorney's office has filed charges against three of the police officers seen in a notorious video eating pot laced candy bars during a May 26th, 2015 raid in any Santa Ana medical marijuana dispensary called sky high holistic.
[37:23.650 --> 37:24.650]  Damn, that sentence was hard for me.
[37:24.650 --> 37:25.650]  I apologize.
[37:25.650 --> 37:34.650]  The video first posted by OC weekly last June clearly showed officers passing around candy bars, joking about feeling lightheaded and tossing darts after finishing their Scooby snack.
[37:34.650 --> 37:40.650]  The shocking footage of the sky high cops went viral, leading to nationwide and international news reports.
[37:40.650 --> 37:52.650]  Yet in its official announcement of the misdemeanor charges filed today, the OCD claims there is no evidence that any of the Santa Ana police department officers shown in the video consumed marijuana products during the raid.
[37:53.650 --> 38:02.650]  Instead, they're being prosecuted for causing intentional damage to legally disabled video cameras and eating detour sample protein bars and Mr.
[38:02.650 --> 38:10.650]  Thinster cookies that were not marijuana laced products on sale at the dispensary, but were simply snacks available to staff.
[38:10.650 --> 38:12.650]  I hate the word laced.
[38:12.650 --> 38:14.650]  I hate the word lace too.
[38:14.650 --> 38:18.650]  But, uh, you know, basically the good news is charges were filed.
[38:19.650 --> 38:32.650]  Bad news is because the video footage is so grainy, they're claiming or the cops are claiming that what they were consuming were non infused products that the store had on hand for staff.
[38:32.650 --> 38:37.650]  And one of their charges, if I remember correctly, is stealing those food items.
[38:37.650 --> 38:39.650]  Yeah, we'll get that's an article.
[38:39.650 --> 38:40.650]  So we'll get to that.
[38:40.650 --> 38:41.650]  Yeah.
[38:41.650 --> 38:44.650]  But dude, just listeners think about this.
[38:44.650 --> 38:49.650]  What's the last time you shared a candy bar with a coworker?
[38:50.650 --> 38:51.650]  Like pass that shit around.
[38:51.650 --> 38:53.650]  Like how many times have you been at a place?
[38:53.650 --> 38:54.650]  Yeah.
[38:54.650 --> 38:55.650]  Okay.
[38:55.650 --> 38:56.650]  I'm going to just think about that.
[38:56.650 --> 39:02.650]  The officers named in the OCD announcement as facing petty theft charges for eating the supposedly non pot laced candy bars.
[39:02.650 --> 39:03.650]  Okay.
[39:03.650 --> 39:04.650]  I want to stop.
[39:04.650 --> 39:05.650]  Don't say it laced.
[39:05.650 --> 39:09.650]  If you put it in there on purpose and it's being sold as laced is hiding it.
[39:09.650 --> 39:15.650]  Laces when you put some, when you take a joint and you put some special sprinkles in there and you don't tell somebody and they smoke it like, yo, I'm fucked up.
[39:15.650 --> 39:16.650]  And you're like, yeah, it was laced.
[39:16.650 --> 39:19.650]  That's laced infused is what we're doing here.
[39:19.650 --> 39:23.650]  We're purposely putting this thing only happens in crazy people's minds.
[39:23.650 --> 39:26.650]  Like it's mostly a myth.
[39:26.650 --> 39:32.650]  It's definitely not what dispensaries do to, uh, to get their customers stone, right?
[39:32.650 --> 39:34.650]  Lacing doesn't happen in a dispensary.
[39:34.650 --> 39:36.650]  So non pot infused candy bars.
[39:36.650 --> 39:45.650]  Uh, the, uh, the let's see the officers named in the OCD announcement is facing petty theft charges for eating the supposedly non pot infused candy bars are Brandon Matthew.
[39:45.650 --> 39:46.650]  Do we want to read all their names?
[39:46.650 --> 39:48.650]  I don't want to glorify them by reading their names.
[39:48.650 --> 39:59.650]  Uh, another officer also faces an additional count of vandalism for damaging the disabled video cameras and allegedly smashing their lenses into the corner of a display case and cash register.
[39:59.650 --> 40:01.650]  Uh, that guy's an extra dick.
[40:01.650 --> 40:02.650]  That's cool.
[40:02.650 --> 40:03.650]  He gets an extra charge.
[40:03.650 --> 40:08.650]  The three defendants are accused of consuming the food items and sharing the protein bars with other SAPD personnel.
[40:08.650 --> 40:18.650]  The press release States before leaving the premises at the conclusion of the search warrant, two officers, I can't even say one of their names are accused of taking extra cookies with them.
[40:18.650 --> 40:28.650]  The DA's office says it concluded a thorough investigation of the incident, including the careful review of more than 16 hours of unedited video surveillance footage with cooperation of the SAPD.
[40:29.650 --> 40:40.650]  While other SAPD personnel like the bald cop seen in the video saying he felt lightheaded after eating one of them ate some protein bars, there is unsignificant, unsufficient evidence.
[40:40.650 --> 40:41.650]  Sorry, I'm stuttering on this one.
[40:41.650 --> 40:47.650]  There is insufficient evidence that they knew the food items belong to the dispensary and not their fellow officers.
[40:47.650 --> 40:48.650]  The release States.
[40:48.650 --> 40:54.650]  There was also no evidence that any SAPD personnel consumed any edible marijuana items available at the dispensary.
[40:55.650 --> 40:59.650]  And then it's they expect us to believe this shit.
[40:59.650 --> 41:00.650]  Well, the article even says, right.
[41:00.650 --> 41:05.650]  No evidence whatsoever other than the fact that the cops were at a pot shop eating candy bars and acting high.
[41:05.650 --> 41:15.650]  One is one is then left with the obvious conclusion that these poor officers are so underpaid that they have no choice but to munch down on pilfered protein bars while on duty.
[41:15.650 --> 41:17.650]  That makes so much more sense.
[41:17.650 --> 41:18.650]  Right?
[41:18.650 --> 41:19.650]  Like.
[41:19.650 --> 41:22.650]  They broke in, they smashed everything.
[41:23.650 --> 41:29.650]  And they were like, oh, Chaz brought cookies like to their military style, right?
[41:29.650 --> 41:30.650]  Like you've seen the video.
[41:30.650 --> 41:33.650]  They jump out of their SWAT car and their SWAT gear.
[41:33.650 --> 41:37.650]  They fucking bang open and unlock fucking door by kicking it the wrong way.
[41:37.650 --> 41:40.650]  A bunch of screaming, yelling at everybody.
[41:40.650 --> 41:43.650]  And they're like, what the dude in the back had cookies.
[41:43.650 --> 41:45.650]  How are you?
[41:46.650 --> 41:49.650]  Like, how little attention do they think we're paying?
[41:49.650 --> 41:54.650]  They sit there in the video and talk about how they're all woozy from eating the protein bars they stole.
[41:54.650 --> 42:02.650]  Like, and when you see the video and then you look at these charges and it's like, OK, the rest of that was just legal common procedure.
[42:02.650 --> 42:04.650]  Like, how is that common?
[42:04.650 --> 42:12.650]  Well, it also says if convicted on all counts, the trio of uninformed snack fiends faces between six months and one year in jail plus fines.
[42:13.650 --> 42:17.650]  So if they do get if they do go to court, they do get a jury.
[42:17.650 --> 42:22.650]  The jury is going to watch this video and convict them if they get real people on the jury, if they don't fucking right.
[42:22.650 --> 42:24.650]  If you get that real nice.
[42:24.650 --> 42:25.650]  Yeah.
[42:26.650 --> 42:29.650]  I kind of want to see what happens to these guys if they go to jail.
[42:30.650 --> 42:31.650]  Nothing good.
[42:31.650 --> 42:32.650]  Cops don't do well in jail.
[42:32.650 --> 42:33.650]  I haven't been there.
[42:33.650 --> 42:34.650]  I don't know.
[42:34.650 --> 42:38.650]  But I could I've seen plenty of movies to know that cops are not going to do well in jail.
[42:38.650 --> 42:42.650]  The behavior is so egregious and we've seen it for so long in this community.
[42:42.650 --> 42:46.650]  There's a raid for a dispensary or whatnot.
[42:46.650 --> 42:52.650]  And they come back the day after the raid with video cameras and everything's broken.
[42:52.650 --> 42:59.650]  Like everything, everything, the walls, the lights, the light bulbs, the doorknobs, everything's destroyed.
[42:59.650 --> 43:00.650]  The carpet's ripped up.
[43:00.650 --> 43:02.650]  Electrical wiring is destroyed.
[43:03.650 --> 43:06.650]  And it's like, well, you were serving a search warrant.
[43:06.650 --> 43:08.650]  It's just a display of aggression.
[43:08.650 --> 43:10.650]  You just came in, destroyed everything and bashed.
[43:10.650 --> 43:12.650]  You didn't even arrest anybody.
[43:12.650 --> 43:13.650]  No charges were filed.
[43:13.650 --> 43:15.650]  You just came in, took everything, destroyed everything you didn't.
[43:15.650 --> 43:17.650]  That isn't worth taking and left.
[43:17.650 --> 43:20.650]  Like, that's not law enforcement.
[43:20.650 --> 43:21.650]  That's piracy.
[43:22.650 --> 43:23.650]  That's terrorism.
[43:23.650 --> 43:24.650]  It's insane.
[43:25.650 --> 43:30.650]  And most of the public's cool with it because they're doing it to the stoners.
[43:31.650 --> 43:36.650]  The stoners that worked hard to open a business and ready to help and contribute.
[43:36.650 --> 43:52.650]  Thank God there hasn't been a lot of these raids in Colorado, but I see them regularly in other states where a business has invested years, millions of dollars to get up running, start getting successful.
[43:52.650 --> 43:56.650]  And then the cops come in, destroy everything, take everything worth money and bounce.
[43:56.650 --> 43:59.650]  And a year later, no one's been charged with anything.
[44:00.650 --> 44:01.650]  And the store is back up and running again.
[44:02.650 --> 44:10.650]  Yep. I mean, from my perspective, that's why they don't want us to use banks because there's more paperwork to seize a bank account than to just snatch the safes.
[44:11.650 --> 44:12.650]  I hadn't thought about it that way.
[44:12.650 --> 44:13.650]  That sucks.
[44:13.650 --> 44:14.650]  Yeah.
[44:14.650 --> 44:15.650]  Yeah. That sounds accurate.
[44:15.650 --> 44:16.650]  There's more cash in there.
[44:16.650 --> 44:18.650]  They can just come get it and buy themselves more armored vehicles and Humvees.
[44:19.650 --> 44:21.650]  Right. These aren't necessarily the opinions of the podcast.
[44:21.650 --> 44:22.650]  These are the opinions of a web like yourself.
[44:23.650 --> 44:24.650]  I agree with you.
[44:24.650 --> 44:25.650]  I might support your statements, my friend.
[44:25.650 --> 44:26.650]  That's why I bring you on the show.
[44:27.650 --> 44:34.650]  That's why I don't mind waiting for hours in line to vote is because I started paying attention.
[44:34.650 --> 44:37.650]  And the more I paid attention, the more it caught my attention.
[44:37.650 --> 44:39.650]  And the more I saw, the more pissed I got.
[44:42.650 --> 44:43.650]  All right.
[44:43.650 --> 44:45.650]  Start reading the news in your area, folks.
[44:45.650 --> 44:46.650]  Mike, you should just do mic drops.
[44:47.650 --> 44:49.650]  You should just take that mic right out of the stand to start dropping it occasionally.
[44:50.650 --> 44:51.650]  We've had enough gear problems without me breaking a mic.
[44:52.650 --> 44:53.650]  All right.
[44:53.650 --> 44:55.650]  So speaking of gear problems, let me see how long we've been going.
[44:55.650 --> 44:56.650]  I'm guessing about 33 minutes.
[44:57.650 --> 44:58.650]  I haven't looked.
[44:58.650 --> 44:59.650]  We are at 44 minutes.
[45:00.650 --> 45:01.650]  Shout out to my friend 44.
[45:01.650 --> 45:02.650]  44 and 2 is your new name, buddy.
[45:02.650 --> 45:06.650]  I don't know if you listen to the podcast lately, but you've earned the new name of 44 and 2.
[45:07.650 --> 45:08.650]  Number one was that ticket.
[45:09.650 --> 45:10.650]  And number two was your recent adventure.
[45:11.650 --> 45:12.650]  So 44 and 2 is your new name, tough guy.
[45:13.650 --> 45:14.650]  Yeah.
[45:14.650 --> 45:15.650]  That's all the podcast we got for you today.
[45:16.650 --> 45:17.650]  Mike, thanks for coming and hanging out.
[45:18.650 --> 45:19.650]  Sorry I had to make it a late night for you.
[45:19.650 --> 45:20.650]  Happy to, my man.
[45:20.650 --> 45:23.650]  Late nights to get these shows in are the name of the game right now.
[45:24.650 --> 45:25.650]  Yes, it is.
[45:25.650 --> 45:26.650]  You got the kit.
[45:26.650 --> 45:27.650]  I got the job.
[45:27.650 --> 45:28.650]  You got the job.
[45:28.650 --> 45:31.650]  I hope you guys enjoyed because we worked pretty hard to bring a good one to you.
[45:32.650 --> 45:33.650]  Yes, we do.
[45:34.650 --> 45:35.650]  We do.
[45:35.650 --> 45:36.650]  That's the truth.
[45:36.650 --> 45:37.650]  I was going to try to come up with some smart ass to say, but I didn't have shit for you.
[45:38.650 --> 45:39.650]  Oh.
[45:39.650 --> 45:40.650]  Right.
[45:40.650 --> 45:41.650]  Too many dabs to be a smart ass at this point in time.
[45:42.650 --> 45:43.650]  I want to thank everybody for listening to the podcast.
[45:44.650 --> 45:45.650]  I don't have a lot to say here at the end of the show.
[45:46.650 --> 45:47.650]  I don't have any sponsors.
[45:47.650 --> 45:48.650]  Make sure you check out the secret sesh.
[45:49.650 --> 45:50.650]  That's it.
[45:50.650 --> 45:51.650]  Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[45:52.650 --> 45:54.650]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[46:34.220 --> 46:35.220]  Make me smile.
[46:35.220 --> 46:36.220]  My smile for me to make.
[46:37.220 --> 46:38.220]  I said smile.
[46:39.220 --> 46:40.220]  Smile.
[46:41.220 --> 46:42.220]  Smile for me to make.
[46:43.220 --> 46:44.220]  Never.
[46:45.220 --> 46:46.220]  You cry.
[46:47.220 --> 46:48.220]  I'm here for you.
[46:49.220 --> 46:50.220]  Jamaica.
[46:51.220 --> 46:52.220]  Try your best.
[46:53.220 --> 46:54.220]  Smile.
[46:55.220 --> 46:56.220]  Smile for me to make.
[46:57.220 --> 46:58.220]  No, she have to do.
[46:59.220 --> 47:00.220]  The same thing.
[47:01.220 --> 47:02.220]  I'm here for you.
[47:03.220 --> 47:07.220]  A beautiful woman with the sweetest gifts
[47:07.220 --> 47:10.220]  Beautiful sunrise and an evening kiss
[47:10.220 --> 47:14.220]  Off a nice sunset on the evening seas, yeah
[47:14.220 --> 47:17.220]  But she tell me say she tired
[47:17.220 --> 47:20.220]  Tired of the exploits and the liars
[47:20.220 --> 47:22.220]  She give them reggae, give them beaters
[47:22.220 --> 47:24.220]  Give them flowers and the ferns
[47:24.220 --> 47:26.220]  All she got is abuse in return
[47:26.220 --> 47:30.220]  But I say, don't you worry yourself, mama
[47:30.220 --> 47:33.220]  Hey, chronic disease here to your help, mama
[47:33.220 --> 47:36.220]  Ooh, I say, don't you worry yourself, mama
[47:36.220 --> 47:39.220]  One thing we a beg you do for me

[48:02.220 --> 48:04.220]  All that she ask me
[48:04.220 --> 48:06.220]  And this is what I say
[48:06.220 --> 48:09.220]  A sweet, sweet chronic self, give them, give them
[48:09.220 --> 48:12.220]  Give and drop, beat and I redeem, redeem
[48:12.220 --> 48:15.220]  I will give them bop with a different stepping
[48:15.220 --> 48:19.220]  I will give them bolt, nobody can run, let them
[48:19.220 --> 48:21.220]  Ooh, but see ya
[48:21.220 --> 48:25.220]  They must see things, say you're out of ideas
[48:25.220 --> 48:28.220]  You give them art and sweet literature
[48:28.220 --> 48:31.220]  You're gonna make the world see the better picture
[48:31.220 --> 48:35.220]  Ooh, I say, don't you worry yourself, mama
[48:35.220 --> 48:38.220]  Chronic disease here to your help, mama
[48:38.220 --> 48:41.220]  Hey, I say, don't you worry yourself, mama
[48:41.220 --> 48:44.220]  One thing we a beg you do for me
[48:44.220 --> 48:48.220]  And I say, smile, girl, smile
[48:48.220 --> 48:50.220]  Smile for me Jamaica
[48:50.220 --> 49:00.960]  And I say, girl, smile
[49:00.960 --> 49:03.960]  Smile for me Jamaica
[49:03.960 --> 49:05.960]  And I say, smile
[50:08.900 --> 50:22.900]  I'm getting down over here.
[50:22.900 --> 50:25.900]  Man, I want to thank my guests for joining me.
[50:25.900 --> 50:27.900]  Sitting to my left is my good buddy White Mike.
[50:27.900 --> 50:29.900]  White Mike, how you doing, buddy?
[50:29.900 --> 50:30.900]  Doing good, man. How are you?
[50:30.900 --> 50:32.900]  I am great. I'm fucked up on kombucha and Dr. Pepper.
[50:32.900 --> 50:35.900]  I'm all fired up and ready to do a good podcast.
[50:35.900 --> 50:37.900]  Yeah, I'm fired up too. This should be a good one.
[50:37.900 --> 50:39.900]  You got a bunch of Dr. Mountain Dew in front of you there.
[50:39.900 --> 50:41.900]  You should be fired up pretty well.
[50:41.900 --> 50:42.900]  Fired up, ready to go.
[50:42.900 --> 50:44.900]  Awesome. Right in front of me is my new,
[50:44.900 --> 50:45.900]  why did I say new?
[50:45.900 --> 50:47.900]  My old buddy Gary. Thanks for joining me, bro.
[50:47.900 --> 50:48.900]  I am glad to be here.
[50:48.900 --> 50:51.900]  Do you represent any organization or are you just here out of Gary's kindness?
[50:51.900 --> 50:55.900]  Not at all. Just, you know, concerned citizen.
[50:55.900 --> 50:57.900]  Concerned citizen. Well, we're glad to have you.
[50:57.900 --> 50:58.900]  Very glad to have you.
[50:58.900 --> 51:02.900]  Before we get started in the podcast, I do have a few things I want to talk about.
[51:02.900 --> 51:04.900]  Remember when I said bad shit happens in threes?
[51:04.900 --> 51:06.900]  We lost three friends in the month of March.
[51:06.900 --> 51:09.900]  I want to give a huge shout out to my good friend, John Gerlach.
[51:09.900 --> 51:12.900]  John Gerlach was a local Pueblo musician.
[51:12.900 --> 51:14.900]  He played in a band known as Lizard Run.
[51:14.900 --> 51:16.900]  He played in all the open mics.
[51:16.900 --> 51:18.900]  He played with a bunch of the most popular musicians in Colorado.
[51:18.900 --> 51:20.900]  He was a really inspiring drummer.
[51:20.900 --> 51:23.900]  He was a guitar player. He was a vocalist. He was a songwriter.
[51:23.900 --> 51:24.900]  He wrote a couple of my favorite songs.
[51:24.900 --> 51:27.900]  He wrote a song called Fuck Buddy that always makes me giggle.
[51:27.900 --> 51:29.900]  Right? Everybody at the table smiled when they heard it.
[51:29.900 --> 51:31.900]  Who couldn't smile at a song called Fuck Buddy?
[51:31.900 --> 51:33.900]  John was an amazing musician.
[51:33.900 --> 51:34.900]  They called him Girly.
[51:34.900 --> 51:35.900]  So a big shout out to Girly.
[51:35.900 --> 51:37.900]  Love you. Miss you, bro. Rest in peace.
[51:37.900 --> 51:41.900]  Fuck. Hopefully that's the last rest in peace we have to do on the podcast for quite a while.
[51:41.900 --> 51:43.900]  That was the third one in March.
[51:43.900 --> 51:45.900]  So, god damn.
[51:45.900 --> 51:47.900]  Shout out to Gerlach. Love you, bro.
[51:47.900 --> 51:50.900]  Also, I have an email from a friend.
[51:50.900 --> 51:54.900]  I talked about dosage on the podcast of edibles.
[51:54.900 --> 51:57.900]  And apparently I recommended too much
[51:57.900 --> 52:03.900]  because this guy said that his girlfriend was nearly tripping from the dosage that I recommended.
[52:03.900 --> 52:05.900]  Do you remember what you recommended?
[52:05.900 --> 52:07.900]  No. No, I don't.
[52:07.900 --> 52:10.900]  But I think we're supposed to recommend 5 or 10 milligrams.
[52:10.900 --> 52:11.900]  I think I said 25.
[52:11.900 --> 52:13.900]  I think I said 25.
[52:13.900 --> 52:16.900]  Yeah, I hear a lot of people recommends.
[52:16.900 --> 52:20.900]  They tell people, oh, you've been smoking flour for years.
[52:20.900 --> 52:24.900]  You want to start with 10 or 20 or 30 or 40.
[52:24.900 --> 52:26.900]  And I say that's nuts.
[52:26.900 --> 52:28.900]  Start with 10. Work your way up slow.
[52:28.900 --> 52:30.900]  It comes in a 10 pack.
[52:30.900 --> 52:31.900]  Like, that's why.
[52:31.900 --> 52:33.900]  Okay. So, I apologize, you guys.
[52:33.900 --> 52:37.900]  If you got all wrecked because you ate too much edibles because of me,
[52:37.900 --> 52:38.900]  I owe you an apology.
[52:38.900 --> 52:43.900]  And email me if that happened, and I'll let you come punch me in the balls or something.
[52:43.900 --> 52:44.900]  We'll make it up to you.
[52:44.900 --> 52:47.900]  Edibles hit some people where you really want to start slow
[52:47.900 --> 52:51.900]  and keep your dose low until you step it up.
[52:51.900 --> 52:55.900]  You want to know how hard it's going to hit you, how long it's going to take to hit you.
[52:55.900 --> 52:58.900]  Because edibles will wreck you if you're not ready for it.
[52:58.900 --> 53:00.900]  You can come feed me too many edibles.
[53:00.900 --> 53:03.900]  If you overdose yourself because of my advice.
[53:03.900 --> 53:05.900]  I'll let you do that.
[53:05.900 --> 53:06.900]  All right.
[53:06.900 --> 53:10.900]  So, I apologize if I misguided somebody and made them eat too much THC.
[53:10.900 --> 53:14.900]  The correct dosage, if you're going to consume edibles and it's your first time and you're a noob,
[53:14.900 --> 53:17.900]  you should probably stick with 10 milligrams to start.
[53:17.900 --> 53:18.900]  Wait about an hour.
[53:18.900 --> 53:21.900]  If you don't feel anything, wait another hour and eat 10 more.
[53:21.900 --> 53:24.900]  Or do you think we should tell them to eat an hour and eat more?
[53:24.900 --> 53:26.900]  Eat 10, wait two hours.
[53:26.900 --> 53:27.900]  Two hours.
[53:27.900 --> 53:28.900]  All right.
[53:28.900 --> 53:31.900]  Eat two hours that will have had time for your stomach to break it down,
[53:31.900 --> 53:34.900]  process it through your liver and get it in your blood.
[53:34.900 --> 53:37.900]  Don't eat more before that first window's up.
[53:37.900 --> 53:42.900]  If that window hits and you never felt anything, go ahead and step your dose up.
[53:42.900 --> 53:46.900]  But something should have kicked or it kicked in, you just might not have noticed.
[53:46.900 --> 53:51.900]  I was going to say something I want to mention is oftentimes I'll eat some edibles as I'm getting ready to go somewhere
[53:51.900 --> 53:53.900]  and I'll be like, these edibles aren't even working.
[53:53.900 --> 53:54.900]  What the fuck is going on?
[53:54.900 --> 53:59.900]  And then you get wherever you're going and you're like, oh, man, edibles are working.
[53:59.900 --> 54:00.900]  So sometimes you got to get out of the house.
[54:00.900 --> 54:01.900]  You got to go for a walk.
[54:01.900 --> 54:04.900]  You got to just go to the store.
[54:04.900 --> 54:08.900]  But also I feel like when I'm here, this is my comfort zone right here.
[54:08.900 --> 54:10.900]  I got the computer in front of me, the mixing board to one side.
[54:10.900 --> 54:11.900]  I got the email right here.
[54:11.900 --> 54:12.900]  I got another rig right here.
[54:12.900 --> 54:13.900]  I got my drink.
[54:13.900 --> 54:16.900]  If anything goes too wrong right here, there's a couch right there I can just lay down on,
[54:16.900 --> 54:17.900]  like within 10 feet.
[54:17.900 --> 54:18.900]  I am cool right here.
[54:18.900 --> 54:21.900]  I don't feel like I get as high here.
[54:21.900 --> 54:23.900]  I could smoke a gram of hash right here and be okay.
[54:23.900 --> 54:27.900]  If I smoked the same gram at your house, I would be three times as high and a little
[54:27.900 --> 54:28.900]  uncomfortable.
[54:28.900 --> 54:30.900]  It was just something about environment.
[54:30.900 --> 54:31.900]  Absolutely.
[54:31.900 --> 54:35.900]  Like for episode 100, I think I ate 50 milligrams while we were sitting here.
[54:35.900 --> 54:37.900]  The other day, 20 just wrecked me.
[54:37.900 --> 54:39.900]  Like I was super high, having a blast.
[54:39.900 --> 54:42.900]  And it took me a minute to realize that like, wait a second.
[54:42.900 --> 54:45.900]  Yeah, it was just those two 10 milligram gummies that did this.
[54:45.900 --> 54:47.900]  I have a 100 milligram Markawa.
[54:47.900 --> 54:48.900]  Is that how you say it?
[54:48.900 --> 54:51.900]  They have a little liquid drink that they sell.
[54:51.900 --> 54:55.900]  I have a 100 milligram, one of those in my fridge right now that I'm tempted to go grab
[54:55.900 --> 54:56.900]  and consume.
[54:56.900 --> 54:58.900]  Not going to do it.
[54:58.900 --> 54:59.900]  All right.
[54:59.900 --> 55:01.900]  So yeah, stick with the correct dosing.
[55:01.900 --> 55:03.900]  You guys don't get too wrecked.
[55:03.900 --> 55:06.900]  Go outside, go for a walk or something.
[55:06.900 --> 55:09.900]  Just take a break from your normal routine and see if it's kicked in yet.
[55:09.900 --> 55:11.900]  And then if it hasn't, then eat a little bit more.
[55:11.900 --> 55:16.900]  Well, just if you find yourself in over your head, just remember that you can't hurt yourself
[55:16.900 --> 55:17.900]  with weed.
[55:17.900 --> 55:20.900]  You can scare yourself real good, but you're not going to hurt yourself.
[55:20.900 --> 55:21.900]  You're not dying.
[55:21.900 --> 55:22.900]  If you're freaking out, I'm dying.
[55:22.900 --> 55:23.900]  No, you're not.
[55:23.900 --> 55:25.900]  You're just really funny right now.
[55:25.900 --> 55:26.900]  You're just really high.
[55:26.900 --> 55:27.900]  Things seem weird.
[55:27.900 --> 55:28.900]  Give it a little while.
[55:28.900 --> 55:29.900]  Find a sandwich.
[55:29.900 --> 55:30.900]  You're going to be fine.
[55:30.900 --> 55:31.900]  Yeah.
[55:31.900 --> 55:32.900]  Eat something, lay down, drink some caffeine if you can.
[55:32.900 --> 55:33.900]  That'll always help you come back from it.
[55:33.900 --> 55:34.900]  Dairy products.
[55:34.900 --> 55:35.900]  Dairy products are the best.
[55:35.900 --> 55:36.900]  All right.
[55:36.900 --> 55:37.900]  All right.
[55:37.900 --> 55:38.900]  Butter, cheese.
[55:38.900 --> 55:39.900]  I don't do a lot of dairy products, but yeah, in case you might have to.
[55:39.900 --> 55:40.900]  Ice cream.
[55:40.900 --> 55:41.900]  Ice cream's good.
[55:41.900 --> 55:42.900]  All right.
[55:42.900 --> 55:43.900]  It'll help tone it down a little bit.
[55:43.900 --> 55:44.900]  There you go.
[55:44.900 --> 55:45.900]  And get some food in you.
[55:46.900 --> 55:47.900]  I had a bad edibles experience.
[55:47.900 --> 55:53.900]  About my third edible that I consumed was a Dixie Elixirs 75 milligram soda.
[55:53.900 --> 55:54.900]  Oh, the drinks.
[55:54.900 --> 55:55.900]  The drink.
[55:55.900 --> 55:56.900]  Those come on strong.
[55:56.900 --> 56:01.900]  And it was really way too heavy, and I had about a four-hour panic attack.
[56:01.900 --> 56:02.900]  Wow.
[56:02.900 --> 56:05.900]  And now this is being a daily smoker for over 15 years.
[56:05.900 --> 56:06.900]  Yeah.
[56:06.900 --> 56:11.900]  And at that point, I'd been dabbing daily for about three or four months.
[56:11.900 --> 56:13.900]  So I was not a novice in any way.
[56:13.900 --> 56:14.900]  Plenty of THC, plenty of experience.
[56:14.900 --> 56:15.900]  Holy crap.
[56:15.900 --> 56:16.900]  So yeah, edibles are really strange.
[56:16.900 --> 56:23.900]  And when I first started doing edibles, sometimes in those, like I said, the first five attempts,
[56:23.900 --> 56:26.900]  it would take like six to eight hours to kick in.
[56:26.900 --> 56:27.900]  Oh, wow.
[56:27.900 --> 56:28.900]  Yeah.
[56:28.900 --> 56:29.900]  Well, you're a bigger dude.
[56:29.900 --> 56:30.900]  Yeah.
[56:30.900 --> 56:31.900]  Well, slow metabolism.
[56:31.900 --> 56:32.900]  Yeah.
[56:32.900 --> 56:33.900]  So it really varies depending on the person.
[56:33.900 --> 56:34.900]  They hit me.
[56:34.900 --> 56:35.900]  Oh, man.
[56:35.900 --> 56:38.900]  I can almost swallow a damn edible and feel it coming off.
[56:38.900 --> 56:39.900]  Oh, shit.
[56:39.900 --> 56:40.900]  Here it comes.
[56:40.900 --> 56:42.900]  If it's more than 30 minutes, it's bullshit, and I'm taking it back.
[56:42.900 --> 56:43.900]  I'm raising hell.
[56:43.900 --> 56:47.900]  I'm raising hell at somebody because, I mean, they come on right away now.
[56:47.900 --> 56:50.900]  And I'm about at 100 milligrams is where I need to be for a dose.
[56:50.900 --> 56:51.900]  Okay.
[56:51.900 --> 56:53.900]  And that's very effective for me.
[56:53.900 --> 56:55.900]  But now I take that to go to bed.
[56:55.900 --> 56:57.900]  That's how I use edibles.
[56:57.900 --> 57:00.900]  I have an edible at night to go to bed.
[57:00.900 --> 57:01.900]  It helps with my pain.
[57:01.900 --> 57:04.900]  About how long before bedtime do you consume it?
[57:04.900 --> 57:05.900]  About an hour.
[57:05.900 --> 57:06.900]  Okay.
[57:06.900 --> 57:07.900]  That's what I would recommend also.
[57:07.900 --> 57:08.900]  All right.
[57:08.900 --> 57:09.900]  We're on the same page here.
[57:10.900 --> 57:14.900]  I heard a news story up out of Denver that the people going to the ER for
[57:14.900 --> 57:17.900]  marijuana-related reasons are predominantly from out of state.
[57:17.900 --> 57:18.900]  Yeah.
[57:18.900 --> 57:19.900]  And this is why.
[57:19.900 --> 57:20.900]  Well.
[57:20.900 --> 57:21.900]  They go to the store.
[57:21.900 --> 57:22.900]  They don't listen to the buntender.
[57:22.900 --> 57:25.900]  They eat the whole incredible bar, and they end up fried.
[57:25.900 --> 57:26.900]  Absolutely.
[57:26.900 --> 57:28.900]  And they don't have anybody with them.
[57:28.900 --> 57:30.900]  Oh, calm down, honey.
[57:30.900 --> 57:32.900]  Here, have some Haagen-Dazs and a bottle of water.
[57:32.900 --> 57:33.900]  You're going to be just fine.
[57:33.900 --> 57:34.900]  Right.
[57:34.900 --> 57:36.900]  And they end up in the hospital.
[57:36.900 --> 57:38.900]  Just go slow, people.
[57:38.900 --> 57:41.900]  Once you're that high, it's hard to convince yourself you're not that high.
[57:41.900 --> 57:42.900]  Right.
[57:42.900 --> 57:43.900]  You're on drugs.
[57:43.900 --> 57:45.900]  You know what I mean?
[57:45.900 --> 57:46.900]  I'm on drugs, man.
[57:46.900 --> 57:47.900]  I'm freaking out.
[57:47.900 --> 57:48.900]  You just don't know what to do anymore.
[57:48.900 --> 57:53.900]  Also, you know, when I lived in Texas, because of price constraints, I was
[57:53.900 --> 57:54.900]  about a gram a day smoker.
[57:54.900 --> 57:55.900]  Right.
[57:55.900 --> 57:56.900]  And.
[57:56.900 --> 57:57.900]  Flowers or hash?
[57:57.900 --> 57:58.900]  Flowers.
[57:58.900 --> 57:59.900]  Okay.
[57:59.900 --> 58:00.900]  Only flowers.
[58:00.900 --> 58:01.900]  Okay.
[58:01.900 --> 58:02.900]  And because that's all you can get.
[58:02.900 --> 58:03.900]  Oh, in Texas.
[58:03.900 --> 58:04.900]  All right.
[58:04.900 --> 58:05.900]  Yeah.
[58:05.900 --> 58:06.900]  You know what I mean?
[58:06.900 --> 58:07.900]  I'm just going to turn this mic towards you just a little bit.
[58:07.900 --> 58:08.900]  Oh, it's cool.
[58:08.900 --> 58:09.900]  Yeah, it's good.
[58:09.900 --> 58:10.900]  I sounded like it went off when you touched it.
[58:10.900 --> 58:11.900]  That was really odd.
[58:11.900 --> 58:12.900]  Touching that plug.
[58:12.900 --> 58:13.900]  Yeah.
[58:13.900 --> 58:16.900]  No, anyway, it was just more of a cost thing, you know, because it's fucking
[58:16.900 --> 58:17.900]  expensive.
[58:17.900 --> 58:18.900]  Oh, yeah.
[58:18.900 --> 58:19.900]  And you know what I mean?
[58:19.900 --> 58:20.900]  So you have to, you know, you have to budget.
[58:20.900 --> 58:24.900]  So I was, you know, I'd smoked about a gram of flowers a day and when I could
[58:24.900 --> 58:27.900]  get concentrates, I would get them, but they were few and far between.
[58:27.900 --> 58:29.900]  They were very expensive.
[58:29.900 --> 58:31.900]  I've been spending like 60 bucks in the eighth.
[58:31.900 --> 58:34.900]  Isn't it like a gram of concentrate, a felony in Texas?
[58:34.900 --> 58:35.900]  Yes, it is.
[58:35.900 --> 58:36.900]  Yeah.
[58:36.900 --> 58:38.900]  And if we were to have this table right here, we could all go to prison.
[58:38.900 --> 58:41.900]  Oh, we would be, dude, they could just shoot us.
[58:41.900 --> 58:43.900]  Just come in and kill us all.
[58:43.900 --> 58:45.900]  They don't play with concentrates in Texas.
[58:45.900 --> 58:47.900]  Maybe the mic will look at what they had.
[58:47.900 --> 58:48.900]  You got it.
[58:48.900 --> 58:49.900]  You know what I mean?
[58:49.900 --> 58:50.900]  Come on.
[58:50.900 --> 58:51.900]  We were afraid for our lives.
[58:51.900 --> 58:53.900]  Yeah, they were going to turn into weed zombies in Arkansas.
[58:53.900 --> 58:54.900]  God damn it.
[58:54.900 --> 58:58.900]  Yeah, I mean, but you know, yeah, you know, the quality also varied a lot with
[58:58.900 --> 58:59.900]  that weed.
[58:59.900 --> 59:00.900]  Yeah.
[59:00.900 --> 59:01.900]  Because, you know, it was the illegal state.
[59:01.900 --> 59:05.900]  So my, you know, the levels of THC I had in my body then were not what they
[59:05.900 --> 59:06.900]  are now.
[59:06.900 --> 59:09.900]  And if you're coming from out of state here, especially from a state where it's
[59:09.900 --> 59:11.900]  still illegal, you're not a medical user.
[59:11.900 --> 59:12.900]  Yeah.
[59:12.900 --> 59:13.900]  Edibles are a whole different world.
[59:13.900 --> 59:17.900]  They sell a 350 milligram edible and it's a tiny little thing.
[59:17.900 --> 59:19.900]  And I think that's a little dangerous.
[59:19.900 --> 59:20.900]  That could be dangerous for me.
[59:20.900 --> 59:21.900]  I ate that on a podcast.
[59:21.900 --> 59:24.900]  And if I didn't have this chair, I might have flown away.
[59:24.900 --> 59:27.900]  Like this chair and computer and table are all that kept me on this planet.
[59:27.900 --> 59:28.900]  That's hilarious.
[59:28.900 --> 59:33.900]  People got to realize that it's, edibles are a different kind of high.
[59:33.900 --> 59:34.900]  It's not like smoking.
[59:34.900 --> 59:37.900]  Like it's, it's real easy to notice you've had enough and stop hitting the
[59:37.900 --> 59:39.900]  joint as it goes around the circle.
[59:39.900 --> 59:41.900]  You can't eat drugs.
[59:41.900 --> 59:43.900]  I say that a lot at work.
[59:43.900 --> 59:46.900]  Once, once you decide that you're going to eat it, you're on that roller
[59:46.900 --> 59:49.900]  coaster until it comes to a complete stop.
[59:49.900 --> 59:53.900]  There's no eject button in the middle and you just have to ride it out.
[59:53.900 --> 59:57.900]  Like, unfortunately you really can't, like you're going to wake up tomorrow.
[59:57.900 --> 59:58.900]  You're going to be fine.
[59:58.900 --> 01:00:00.900]  As long as you don't.
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:01.900]  Don't call your mom.
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:02.900]  Yeah.
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.900]  Don't call your mom.
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:05.900]  Don't call the cops.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.900]  Don't, don't call the paramedics.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:08.900]  Don't call the cops.
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:09.900]  Call a friend.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.900]  Let them know that you ate too many edibles.
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:12.900]  I got to talk to you.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:13.900]  Yeah.
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.900]  And call Domino's get a pizza on family guy.
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:16.900]  There you go.
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.900]  Get some almond for Joe Buzzy.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:19.900]  Put on the Simpsons.
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:20.900]  That one's for Buzzy.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:21.900]  The Simpsons.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:22.900]  Yeah.
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:23.900]  Buzzy Buzzy is a Simpsons.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:24.900]  Some almond brothers.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.900]  All right.
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:26.900]  So we've corrected that issue.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.900]  Once again, I apologize.
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:29.900]  I keep saying that, but I feel bad if somebody did wreck themselves,
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:30.900]  I'm an asshole.
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:31.900]  That's not cool to do to people.
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:34.900]  I do sincerely feel bad if I wreck somebody's life day, weekend,
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:35.900]  evening, whatever.
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.900]  I mean, maybe that's not really folks.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.900]  It's there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.900]  What's the most you've ever eaten?
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.900]  The most edibles milligrams you've ever eaten.
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.900]  Let me back up one question.
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.900]  What's your daily dose of edibles.
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.900]  I know you like to eat the, the little 50 milligram.
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:51.900]  Was that the.
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.900]  No, they're, they're super soft.
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.900]  They're a, it's a synergy.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:01:00.900]  Five and five, five milligram THC, five milligrams CBD product in morning.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:01.900]  And night.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:02.900]  And then.
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:06.900]  I augment that with a job and doing a lot of green harness lately from
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:07.900]  Chiba.
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:08.900]  Oh, that's a great product.
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:09.900]  Shout out to Chiba.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.900]  Choose non-paid advertisement.
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.900]  Yeah, that's sorry.
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.900]  They're just, they're a great advertising.
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:18.900]  I've been a fan since they weren't just medical.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.900]  And yeah, I sell them all day now.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.900]  So I take a bottle home every couple of days just to enjoy randomly.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.900]  All right.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.900]  So for a medical dose, how much THC do you like to consume?
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.900]  If it's, if it's just like,
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.900]  I just take it as a preventative against inflammation in my knees and
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:35.900]  neck right now.
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:40.900]  So I'm around 10 to 20 milligrams CBD and THC a day.
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:41.900]  Okay.
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.900]  And then like, if my back's messed up or really hurting,
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.900]  or I'm going crazy and my knees are pissed,
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:50.900]  I'll up it to 35, 40, 50 of each.
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:51.900]  Okay.
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:52.900]  Per day.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.900]  Do you have like a recreational,
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:56.900]  like if you're going to take a recreational dose,
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:58.900]  how much do you like to like to take there?
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:03.900]  Anywhere between like 20 and 35 or 40 milligrams of THC.
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:04.900]  Okay.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.900]  What's the most you've ever eaten was going to be my big question on
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.900]  250 or 300.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:13.900]  And that's just what I know from the rec market.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.900]  Like God only knows what used to go into these moments.
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:21.900]  I remember back in the day when Karen or a banana bread, dude.
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:22.900]  Oh my God.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:23.900]  Yeah.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:28.900]  So we have a friend who was a grown man who ate one of those and fell
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:32.900]  down some stairs and knocked me down the bottom portion of those stairs.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.900]  Cause he was too high to function.
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:35.900]  And I was too high to save myself.
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:38.900]  Once he hit me, he fell down and I took me to like a bowling pin.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:39.900]  Yeah.
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:40.900]  And just went down the style.
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:41.900]  And there's only a couple of stairs.
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:43.900]  It was fun, but this grown man just.
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.900]  And giggled like a child because this banana bread was just killing us.
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:49.900]  It was wrecking us.
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:50.900]  Those days were amazing.
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.900]  There aren't edibles like that available in dispensaries.
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.900]  I don't think God only knows how strong that was.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:57.900]  Cause nothing was figured out as well as it is now.
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:58.900]  I, you know, I do that.
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:02.900]  I make my own sometimes and I made some butter today actually out of a,
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:08.900]  well, I made, what I did was I had about ounces of wax, about five of them.
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:09.900]  Okay.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.900]  Over time.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:13.900]  And, um, so I had all these papers.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:14.900]  I still had a lot of residual on them.
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:15.900]  Oh yeah.
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.900]  So I put them in a slow cooker with coconut oil.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.900]  It just soaked all that off of it.
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:21.900]  Yeah.
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.900]  And then I put, you know, a big plop of wax in there too.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.900]  And just let it simmer a while.
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:26.900]  Now that's in the freezer.
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:29.900]  And, um, you know, I'll use that for making some edibles.
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:30.900]  Yeah.
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:31.900]  Yeah.
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:33.900]  And, uh, yeah, but there's no way to tell how much is in there.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.900]  You just got to taste it and see what happens.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:37.900]  Make them small.
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:38.900]  That's awesome.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:39.900]  All right.
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.900]  So you, you, Gary was saying, uh, you like to take a hundred milligrams of
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:43.900]  about an hour before bedtime to help you sleep.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:44.900]  Do you, uh, do, do you increase that if you want to get recreational?
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:45.900]  Actually I decrease it to get recreation.
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:46.900]  Okay.
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:47.900]  So about a 50 milligram dose.
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:48.900]  Because a hundred makes you sleep.
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.900]  Exactly.
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:50.900]  You don't want to overdo it.
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:51.900]  You're going to have to take 200 to sleep every night.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.900]  Exactly.
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:53.900]  Well, it's, it's a little too much, you know, right.
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:54.900]  It's, it puts me out.
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:55.900]  Yeah.
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:56.900]  So half of that, about a 50, sometimes about a 75 makes you a little, if I get those,
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:57.900]  I'm going to have to take a hundred.
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:58.900]  Yeah.
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.900]  So you're going to have to take a hundred.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.900]  Yeah.
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:01.900]  And then you're going to have to take a hundred and a half.
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:02.900]  Yeah.
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:06.100]  So two of those is 70.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:30.940]  That's a good dose for me for, you know, to function and have a good time.
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.940]  I was like, something just went weird.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.940]  I was like, did my car just break down?
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:36.240]  Like, did I just get a flat tire?
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.640]  Did the wind just kick in?
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.740]  Did the earth just die?
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:40.040]  Because suddenly everything was just like,
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.040]  pffft.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.040]  That was weird.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:42.840]  Maddie wrecked me.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.540]  I don't know how many milligrams were in that edible,
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:45.240]  but shout out to Maddie.
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.740]  That thing was fucking tremendous.
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:47.240]  Right?
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.440]  Yeah, it was a hard day at work.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.040]  Everything got done at half speed.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.640]  This is some of the strongest wax I've ever had.
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:58.240]  This, uh, the guy who made it had an outdoor grill,
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.940]  and he let it cure.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.040]  It was beautiful weed.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.240]  It had this great smell.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.240]  It's lamb's breath.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:03.940]  Okay.
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:08.340]  And so it was, the trim was all cured when he blew it.
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.240]  Nice.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.640]  And it tastes good.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:11.440]  It smells good.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.740]  I'm kicking myself for not bringing some for you to try.
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:17.640]  It's so really good, and that's what I made the coconut oil with.
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.740]  It'll be amazing.
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:19.240]  Yeah.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.840]  So it's some of the strongest I've ever had, really.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.340]  Nice.
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:24.040]  I mean, it's not like the best I've ever had, but it's the strongest.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.440]  What's the biggest dose of edibles you've ever taken?
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.440]  I think the 350 Mountain Medicine Bar.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:29.940]  Okay.
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:30.440]  Yeah.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:30.940]  I ate one of those.
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:32.940]  I think it was episode 36, or...
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:35.440]  It was one of the earlier ones, but yeah, it was a funny show.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.240]  Big shout out to Mountain Medicine, too.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.740]  They're really cost-effective, man.
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:39.440]  They're a good product.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.240]  Affordable, yeah.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.440]  And affordable, and they deliver.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.340]  I'm gonna take a dab.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.340]  So somebody say something important.
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:50.440]  Well, the, we actually had a purpose behind this show.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.540]  We have a topic at hand.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.540]  It's not just fun ramblings and responses to comments.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:54.540]  Yeah, we got a couple of comments.
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.040]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.340]  I got two more things I have to cover, and then I'll unleash you guys on that.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:01.440]  So let me, since I took that dab, shout out to Higher Elevate.
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.140]  Let me, I took a dab, so bear with my brain.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:06.440]  Higher Elevation Masterpiece Productions.
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.640]  That's the name of the place.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:11.240]  And also Elevate Glass Gallery in Colorado Springs.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.940]  Higher Elevation Masterpiece Production can repair your broken rig.
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.440]  They will fix your broken glass.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.340]  They will hook you up.
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:18.840]  They're in Colorado Springs.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:24.040]  Search for them on the internet, or call them 719-646-5352.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.140]  They can fix your broken rig.
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.640]  They're in Colorado Springs.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:27.440]  Cool-ass people.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.240]  Great shop.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:31.240]  That is Higher Elevation Masterpiece Productions.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.940]  And their sister store, is that what you call it?
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:35.840]  I think it's their sister store, their homie store, their partner store.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.240]  The other store down the way is Elevate.
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:41.340]  That one is on 517 South Tejon.
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:43.140]  Both are really cool shops.
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:43.940]  I recommend them.
[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:44.840]  The people are wonderful.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.040]  The customer service is great.
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.040]  They've got a great selection of affordable rigs.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.640]  They've got brand name rigs.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:50.940]  They've got Hitman rigs in there.
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.240]  They've got D-Nails in there.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.640]  They've got highly educated titanium products.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.140]  Dude, they've got a product in there.
[01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.740]  I can't believe I didn't buy it while I was there.
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:01.340]  They've got the highly educated nail with the ceramic dish,
[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:03.240]  or not ceramic, with the quartz dish on top.
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:06.140]  So you got the titanium base with the quartz dish on top.
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.540]  Pretty much indestructible if you take care of it.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.140]  Go get that.
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:11.040]  That's a badass piece.
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:12.540]  But anyway, shout out to those places.
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:13.740]  I support them.
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.140]  I recommend them if you're in Colorado Springs.
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.440]  Also, one more big important message.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.840]  I've been advertising the Secret Sesh on 420.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.240]  Change of plans.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:26.240]  Secret Sesh is now on 421 because of some logistics in the city
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.840]  of Denver and things that go on when you're trying to plan a
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:31.040]  cannabis event and people try to be fucktards.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.740]  But Secret Sesh on 421.
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:33.840]  Make sure you support that.
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:37.640]  Email me for more information or follow, I think it's
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.740]  Secret Sesh Colorado on Instagram.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:40.740]  Check that out.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.040]  I think that's all of the advertising and butt-kissing
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.440]  I've got to do for the start of the show.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:47.740]  And now we can get into the topics that I've invited these
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:48.940]  young men here for.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:51.040]  It's like a steel cage match.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.640]  I just looked at both these guys like I was about to ask
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:53.640]  him if they're ready to fight.
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:56.340]  No, I'm not ready to fight.
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:57.340]  Gary's like, nah, bro.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:58.640]  I was in a car wreck a while back.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.440]  I'm about ready to get chill out and take dabs.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:01.240]  Yeah.
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:04.840]  So the reason that these guys wanted to get together, they
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.440]  actually both messaged me wanting to do a podcast on this
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:07.740]  topic.
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:08.740]  So I love the initiative.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:09.440]  Thank you guys.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:09.940]  Yeah.
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:14.140]  Our local anti-cannabis groups.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:16.140]  Is it one group or were there multiple groups involved in
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:16.940]  this bullshit?
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:20.140]  There might be a second group now.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:22.840]  It could just be the first group using a new name.
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:23.340]  Okay.
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:25.140]  Well then let's not name either one of them.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.140]  One or more.
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:27.440]  That way they don't get any more support.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.340]  Unless, unless our people want to go troll them.
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.740]  Do you want to mention them so that maybe perhaps people and
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:35.540]  I, I couldn't ask our listeners to go and troll these people
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.040]  and say crazy shit on their page.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.040]  But if they did, I couldn't stop them.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:44.640]  Or better yet, just go correct their nonsense politely and
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.240]  watch them stew and freak out on you because it makes them
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.140]  look even worse.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.340]  And they can't figure out what to say.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:50.040]  It's really funny.
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.640]  They don't have any research at all.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.940]  But I think we'll just give them an easy way to find them.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.340]  Just go to your page.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.540]  Yeah, just come to my page.
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.140]  So go check out Mike's Facebook page.
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:01.440]  It is Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.240]  I clicked like I appreciate it.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.140]  I like to follow the updates of what's going on.
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:07.940]  Mike is a very, I don't know the word, but he knows what
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.440]  the fuck is going on in the cannabis world and our local
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.840]  and our state nationwide worldwide.
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.040]  Mike stays up on top of it.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:14.440]  Yeah.
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.040]  And so when I need some updates on cannabis, I go to Mike
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:17.540]  all the time.
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.640]  He's my politics and cannabis update guy.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.440]  There's a lot going on right now.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.040]  So I'm insanely busy.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:23.740]  It's good for you.
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.240]  Keep that mind busy.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:25.940]  All right.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:30.240]  So let's talk about this local group here is trying to close
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:33.140]  all of the recreational cannabis and they do in just record
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:33.740]  they want to do better.
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:35.940]  Well, they want it all gone.
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:39.540]  And if you head over to their page at all and look through
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:43.840]  their post history medicals a sham.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.940]  It's all a joke and a scam and a con to make money on the
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:52.340]  backs of our children and they want it all gone.
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:57.140]  But right now they're just focused on getting rid of the
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:57.940]  rec industry.
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:02.240]  So recreational stores production facilities manufacturers
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.140]  grows testing labs all of it.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:06.140]  They want it gone.
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:10.840]  Yep, because because it's bad.
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:13.340]  Yeah, I that's the only reason I could find on their Facebook
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:15.140]  page because drugs are bad.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:18.840]  Okay, the one article that kind of got into it.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.340]  A little bit of their reasons.
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.640]  They don't like that.
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:26.140]  There are more homeless people in the city than there were
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:26.840]  before.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.340]  They seem to think the crime problem in the city is new and
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:38.640]  somehow cannabis shops in the county related and they there's
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:43.640]  another one the tax that the tax proceeds that come in are
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:48.840]  really really really well reported and they they're
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.740]  pretty sure that if they get rid of the taxes, then no one
[01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:55.440]  in government will have a reason to continue to support the
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.340]  marijuana industry and they'll be able to get rid of the
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:58.140]  rest of it.
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:03.640]  Like it doesn't make a lot of sense and most of their issues
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:08.240]  are with home grows and they're not going to get rid of any
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:08.840]  home grows.
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.140]  You close it rid of the stores.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:13.240]  They're going to produce right can't leave more of them.
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.240]  Absolutely and it'll cater to the black market all over again,
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:17.940]  right?
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.040]  Go ahead Gary.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.440]  Well, we should talk about home grows because there's been a
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:26.240]  big push on home grows lately everywhere multiple raids in
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:33.840]  Denver down here Park County Montrose 17 raids since March
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:37.140]  1st and I'm aware of their in the in the state.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.040]  You know a major major gross the bigger if you're trying to
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:44.340]  do major production out of your house and you're not an
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:50.040]  incredibly well-known medical patient and caregiver that's
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.440]  registered and active in their local politics and stuff.
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:57.640]  I'd have your paperwork in order and have your plant count
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.040]  in order to check your local and County ordinances because
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:03.640]  a lot of the cities and counties are passing limiting plant
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.540]  limiting plant counts while you're asleep.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.840]  They're doing it in private sessions while you're sleeping
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:11.140]  very quietly up to a no a new plant count and they're just
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:13.040]  out in your backyard cutting down your plants because you're
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.240]  out of compliance overnight.
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:18.540]  Yep, they most of it around Colorado's complaint-driven.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.340]  There were a couple of well-publicized bus down here in
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:23.040]  Pueblo.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:27.340]  One of them was because the neighbor complained about some
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:31.040]  shit that most neighbors would have complained about and then
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.440]  the other one they got busted in Florida with a car full of
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:38.240]  weed Texas or Texas or wherever and they snatched back here
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.040]  and
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:41.540]  fuckers
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:45.340]  but the interesting part about both of those is that was people
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:47.840]  from far away trying to grow weed here and take it somewhere
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.140]  else.
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:52.240]  Well, and also they were like like the guy the biggest bus
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:56.840]  with five grow houses right in Pueblo West and everybody
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:01.040]  involved 12 people had all been in Colorado less than 60 days,
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:01.540]  right?
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:04.340]  They're people that they that's a problem.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:07.340]  They don't know any part of the rules exactly and they think
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:08.640]  they can do whatever they want.
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:10.040]  Yeah, they don't even know what to hide.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.140]  They're not even well-informed enough to know to hide.
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:12.640]  Right.
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.140]  It's just not it's just really sloppy and stupid.
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.240]  Absolutely, but it makes the rest of us look bad.
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:22.140]  Yeah, you know, it's my point there and you know, there's
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:24.040]  there is an effort right now
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.840]  from the regulatory bodies, right?
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.840]  And we're seeing it, you know, like Mike was pointing out
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:35.840]  earlier the regulations change abruptly frequently and you
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.340]  know, you have to really stay on top and it's it's almost
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:44.540]  like they are attempting to trip people license holders up
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:47.540]  so that they can find them or pull their license now that
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:49.040]  they have their funds, you know what I mean?
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.040]  Those massive license.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.140]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:54.140]  Yeah, you can't really say that but it's a lot of the rules
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:57.840]  aren't passed with how they'll be implemented in my exactly
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:58.440]  at all.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.440]  And so when they're writing the law they pick an hour.
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.240]  Okay, it's going to pass today.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.740]  Let's give them six months from the today to get it to get
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.440]  any compliance and sometimes they're talking about like major
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.640]  construction issues.
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:12.640]  Are you guys dealing with the new packaging rules at the
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.240]  spot?
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.740]  Yeah, everybody is that's so stupid, isn't it?
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:18.240]  So sorry to go and it's just one of those things.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:20.340]  Yeah, I should that just recently happened in the MED
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:21.040]  tracking system.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:22.640]  Every time you buy loose flour.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.040]  I've got to give you a small pamphlet full of information.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:28.240]  Basically, it's so many printed labels that also my friend
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:30.440]  and then the package in there how everything's a separate
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.140]  package and a batch number at the end of the day.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:32.740]  Yeah, never mind.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:33.040]  Sorry.
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:36.240]  It's the tracking is nuts.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.740]  Like if you think you can move here from from another state
[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:42.540]  grow weed here easily and then ship it back.
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:43.640]  You're fucking nuts.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.840]  Yeah, they're looking for that.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:50.240]  Yes, they're looking for that and be the neighbors are like
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:55.740]  we your local paper hasn't reported on the hundreds of hours
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:59.340]  in City Council meetings that people have spent arguing zoning
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:15:59.840]  rules.
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:03.440]  You haven't seen the hundreds of news articles about them
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:04.940]  every day in your local paper.
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.640]  You just get the major news bulletins and so the rest of
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:12.740]  us know, okay, you can't have 600 plants in your backyard
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.540]  that guy's probably breaking the law.
[01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:16.040]  So he's going to call the cops on him.
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.140]  Don't go over there for a while.
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:21.740]  But I understand that this movement to make Pueblo West
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:27.940]  a city is related somehow to the anti-cannabis stuff that
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.340]  if they can get incorporated as a city, they can get rid
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:30.940]  of it too.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:32.840]  They then put you under municipal rule.
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:34.440]  You're not under the county rule anymore.
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.740]  There's a think that's their plan B.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:38.240]  That's what I understand.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.340]  There's a couple of possible plan B's how many people if
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:45.140]  if the cannabis business were shut down if I said right now
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:47.840]  no more cannabis business in Pueblo West no more recreational
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:48.440]  cannabis.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.140]  How many jobs would be lost immediately?
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:55.040]  It would be somewhere between 700 and a thousand people.
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:59.340]  That's badged employees working at stores grows production
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:03.240]  facilities edible companies and then there's going to be lawyers
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:03.940]  accountants.
[01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:06.740]  Yeah, there's everybody else the accountants the lawyers
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.340]  consultants the packaging Gary over here the security companies
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:15.440]  the contractors the grow store is going to start losing money
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:16.040]  for sure.
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.840]  Well grow they might do better because of more home grows
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:19.740]  are going to spring up.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.240]  I mean that's obvious.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.140]  You know, it's going to take a lot of hard.
[01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:25.540]  I was going to say yeah the volume at those places is going
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:26.240]  to be yeah, it's good.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.340]  What's going to be it's going to throw a lot of stuff in
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:29.840]  disarray.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.140]  It's not gonna be good for anybody.
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:34.940]  It takes more than two vehicles to load up our soil order when
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:36.240]  we go by soil at the shop.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:36.740]  Absolutely.
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:40.940]  I mean Pueblo can't take a hit like that right now for a
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:43.140]  thousand people to be out of work overnight.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.040]  Especially simply can't handle the demographic that is employed
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:53.040]  in most of these facilities are very 25 to 35 to 40 year old
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.740]  folks right now and there's no job or income for yeah.
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:56.140]  Yeah.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:58.740]  Yeah, they're used to living off those bud tender tips and
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:17:59.440]  shit like that.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.740]  They're not going back to the bank, you know, right if they
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:05.140]  lose this job actually we had somebody trying to do that
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:08.240]  recently a friend of ours who lost his job or decided to not
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.340]  be involved in the cannabis industry tried to go get a job
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:12.840]  at a bank and he has to try to figure out how to make that
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:16.440]  adjustment make it look good on a resume and such know the
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:19.940]  hit that Pueblo would take just with those jobs is bad.
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:23.840]  But when you consider that secondary supporting ring, I mean
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.340]  there's a hundred other industries that you need to run a
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:28.840]  dispensary and the tax.
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.240]  But I don't have the article on my computer screen, but I
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:35.640]  should mention the part about the the scholarships will need
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.440]  enough money five million dollars out of the county budget
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:41.040]  next year if that like that's what they're projected to make
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:41.440]  this year.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:48.840]  So if new in November elections if this passes next year, we
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:53.540]  might collect three and a half million before October when
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:56.340]  this rule would kick in but then that's it.
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:59.640]  And so there's five million dollars for the stuff in the
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.340]  county budget.
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:03.640]  We've slated to do with this money like 1.3 million of its
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:07.840]  going to the State Fair to fix up the egg building.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.340]  There's another 700,000 going for college scholarships here
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:14.840]  in Pueblo.
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:18.540]  So local call high school kids that are getting ready to
[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:19.540]  graduate right now.
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:21.840]  If they want to go to one of the two colleges down here in
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:26.240]  Pueblo, they can apply for a marijuana scholarship and all
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.240]  of that money is coming from marijuana taxes.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.840]  So we're sending kids to college with this money hashtag
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.040]  marijuana scholarship.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:33.640]  That's all I've got to say about that.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.740]  There's some middle school out in Pueblo West where it's just
[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:39.440]  like the road.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:43.240]  There's no sidewalk or gutter or anything that the kids walk
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.440]  on from their neighborhood to the school every day and it's
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:49.640]  like crazy unsafe because the buses that kids from a little
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.340]  further out or riding on are traveling on the street to
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.540]  they're putting sidewalks in there with this money.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:57.340]  Like we're doing shit that should have been done forever
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:00.940]  ago that we couldn't afford to do and we're going to stop
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:04.940]  five million dollars worth of that just overnight.
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.640]  Maybe after this November's election.
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.640]  It's crazy to think about so there's a lot of people fired
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.340]  up in Pueblo right now over this.
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:18.340]  It's it would be ridiculous to put that many tax dollars in
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:21.140]  the in the toilet and flush it down and put that many people
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.140]  out of employment.
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:22.740]  It would be stupid.
[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:26.040]  I think well for something that's not causing any problems
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.540]  particularly when you think about you know, marijuana was
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:30.940]  here before it was legal and it's going to be here after
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:34.640]  it's you know, even if they pass this it's not going anywhere
[01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:38.040]  right and just all the benefits are going away.
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.840]  Yeah, and then the problems are going to compound the growers
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.140]  that lose their jobs at the dispensaries are going to go
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.340]  grow the black market go to shit out of it not pay taxes
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:48.640]  on it have people coming to go into their residence create
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:51.740]  more traffic in your residence have an illegal grow and next
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.940]  door to your house have people come into by herb next door
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:54.740]  to your house.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.740]  Well, that's what caught me is really bizarre about this
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:01.740]  this effort to shut down the rec industry is that's where
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.440]  the benefits come from exactly.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:09.140]  They they're almost problem-free in the entire run that
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:14.240]  Pueblo has done with marijuana shops period old one license
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:18.440]  was rescinded kind of automatically and then another license
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:23.540]  was the first dispensary in Colorado period to get shut down
[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:27.740]  for regulatory infractions not law violations or major rule
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:28.140]  breaking.
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:29.840]  They just the regulations change.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:30.940]  They couldn't meet him fast enough.
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:36.540]  They got in trouble, but that's been it like we don't cause
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:37.140]  crime.
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:40.440]  We don't have stuff going out the back door to some other
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.940]  place or state.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.440]  We don't have teenagers shopping there like everybody down
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.740]  here in the legal industry follows the rules because we all
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:50.440]  want to be open next month and any small violation of the
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:51.640]  rules can cost you a license.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.440]  It's just that simple.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.940]  That's why you don't see big dispensaries screwing up in any
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:56.840]  major ways.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:00.440]  It's because it's too expensive to risk screwing up.
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:03.040]  Yeah, so you end up hiring three or four people to just run
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.540]  around all day and make sure everybody's complying with the
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:06.240]  rules.
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:12.040]  Most of the problems these people have with legal marijuana
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:18.040]  have to do with every other part of marijuana being legal home
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:23.440]  grows where people can consume how people can consume the
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:27.040]  variety of edible products access to teenagers like none of
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.240]  that shit changes.
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.840]  If you get rid of wreck it all gets worse every bit of it gets
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:31.240]  worse.
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:35.040]  It's the the County shops are doing like 1.7 to 2.5 million
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.840]  in sales every year you figure half that's tourists.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:41.340]  So you still got a million a half going back into the ghetto.
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:43.940]  Like that's not a good thing.
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:47.840]  Like you don't want all of that business taking place in the
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:52.140]  house at the street because those are the ones that bad people
[01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:54.840]  with shotgun show up and try to rob hotels are going to lose
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.440]  money restaurants are going to lose money.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.840]  The movie theater will lose money.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.840]  Well, yeah, that's the other half of that money is all the
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.440]  people coming here for vacation.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:01.540]  Now.
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:03.440]  We were a spring break destination.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.740]  Yeah, no one.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:08.140]  I never grew up here has ever had like a bunch of people in
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:12.140]  town for spring break a lot of people came to town for spring
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:12.840]  break this year.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.440]  I was weird.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:16.740]  Yeah, it was really you know, and then the thing is if they
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:21.140]  would turn a little different and promote that and cultivate
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:24.140]  that then that could be huge next year, you know what I mean
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:27.040]  and massive amount of tax dollars right massive amounts.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.240]  How many what do they make a year out there in Pueblo West
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:32.440]  and cannabis taxes last year?
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.840]  It was like 1.7 million this next year.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:39.040]  It's going to be five mainly because there's a new 3.5% tax
[01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:40.140]  on the production.
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.840]  So an excise tax is five million dollars.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.140]  Well, they put in massive growth facilities.
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:45.740]  Do you know?
[01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:49.540]  Yeah, there's a huge expansion and then the we didn't have
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:52.140]  a special excise tax just a special sales tax.
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:55.940]  Do you know by any random chance what Pueblo West's other
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:24:00.640]  tax income is like what do they bring in other than a lot?
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.240]  What's the number?
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:03.540]  Do you know their number minus cannabis taxes will know
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:09.740]  the marijuana taxes represent like 2% of the county or the
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.440]  state doesn't make it sound so appealing.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.540]  It is significantly more than alcohol though.
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:14.240]  Okay.
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:18.240]  No already when you put it as an overall percentage.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.140]  It seems small but when you look at the list of stuff that
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:24.140]  like we can't pay cops right now, like there isn't an extra
[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:25.340]  1% right budget.
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:28.640]  So when you got five million extra you can maybe and it's
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:31.840]  not so much extra at this point because lights in West.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:34.540]  It's the darkest fucking city I've ever driven through they
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:37.840]  budgeted for it because it's going to come in this year.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:43.640]  And so funding got moved around and when the five million
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.140]  for marijuana like if that doesn't come in because of this
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:50.140]  vote all kinds of stuff isn't going to happen the year
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:52.740]  after that because of those cuts it'll start to look like
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:53.840]  Detroit in a few years.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.940]  You I like you really can't of Pueblo definitely can't afford
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:24:59.140]  to lose that kind of jobs.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:02.440]  Like you see major articles in the Chieftain when the steel
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.640]  mill is off 200 people temporarily because the impact that
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.840]  the city feels when that happens is major.
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:12.840]  That's 200 paychecks with a thousand people say it's only
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:16.340]  700 if 700 people stop bringing home paychecks because of
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:21.440]  this vote like that's 700 fewer people that can order dinner
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.940]  have pizza delivered go to the movies go get another pair
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:27.340]  of sneakers go get their kids school supplies like their
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:28.840]  car or that stuff.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:31.740]  It's 700 people that are going to be applying for food stamps.
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:32.040]  Yep.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:35.640]  It's 700 people that are going to go into food unemployment
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:36.540]  food pantries.
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:41.640]  It's 700 more stresses on an already overtaxed system of
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:45.040]  support in this community and a small community pointless.
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:49.540]  Yeah, it's literally like 1% of the people in Pueblo County
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:51.840]  like there's a hundred and thirty some thousand people down
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:52.040]  here.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:54.240]  So it's like the worst type of self-sabotage.
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:56.540]  Yeah, we really can't take it right like that.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.140]  It really is.
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:02.940]  No, it's it's you know, the reason I wanted to have this
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:06.040]  podcast the reason I wanted to talk about this issue is I
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:11.740]  want everybody who supports cannabis to take it seriously
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:17.240]  because from my perspective on social media and out in the
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:17.840]  community.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:21.240]  Nobody's really taking it seriously and that's that frightens
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.240]  me to be honest.
[01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:25.340]  I don't think anybody took the idea that they could shut
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:27.340]  down cannabis in Pueblo West.
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:28.040]  Seriously.
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:29.640]  It doesn't seem like something feasible.
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:30.540]  Like oh they can't do that.
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:34.040]  We voted it voted it in is what a lot of people say and they
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:35.340]  just get it on the ballot.
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:36.340]  Nobody shows up.
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:37.140]  They can vote it right.
[01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:38.340]  They can vote it right out.
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:39.440]  Just like we voted it.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:42.640]  Yeah, it's it's a weird election to run this in.
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.440]  It's the anti-pop people tend to be more conservative.
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:50.040]  We just had a Democratic president for eight years.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:54.540]  No, no, no stretch in American history.
[01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:57.640]  Have we had a two-term president from one party or another
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:00.040]  followed by a president from that same party.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:05.240]  So history tells us that more conservatives are going to turn
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:09.740]  out in this election than liberals to vote for president,
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:14.440]  which means they're going to be at the polls, which means that
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:17.940]  if the youth vote and the pro-cannabis vote don't come out
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:22.040]  in force this November, it's done the legal it will here
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:22.640]  locally.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.440]  We could see the rec industry shut down and a lot of us would
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.940]  be out of work and that would really suck but there's four
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:32.640]  or five states that at least that are legalizing that whole
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:33.140]  big list.
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:36.340]  We did not all of those efforts are going to make the ballot
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:40.640]  but five to eight to ten of them are going to and if people
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.540]  don't show up and vote in those areas those efforts are going
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:47.940]  to lose and all of the people that say or have been saying
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:51.840]  legalization is inevitable are going to watch that tide
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:55.640]  turn and the pendulum is going to swing back the other way
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:59.340]  just like it typically does in politics and we're going to
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:03.040]  see states that have liberalized their marijuana lives start
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:06.440]  to go the other way again, and we don't want to see that.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.840]  So everybody needs to figure out if you're registered to vote
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:13.540]  figure out how to vote in your area where to vote in your area
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:17.040]  and get on top of that and stay on top of that all the way
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.540]  through the election in November.
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:24.040]  I am I like to not just Pueblo West everywhere everywhere.
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:27.040]  It's it's important to me locally because I could get fired
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.640]  in November and that would really suck.
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:30.740]  He's got a beautiful little boy that he's got to take care
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:31.840]  of so keep Mike employed.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.940]  I've got a nice little life going right now and that's thanks
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:38.740]  in large part to the recreational industry in Pueblo County
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:41.640]  big shout out to the medical industry in Colorado Springs,
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:42.140]  right?
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.740]  We've all are yeah, all of us are basically working in legal
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:49.640]  cannabis in one way or another and if rec goes this year,
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.440]  I see a lot of the the medical people like well, you know,
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.940]  my shop will be doing better if right goes away.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:58.840]  Yeah for two years at most before this is an election again
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:02.440]  when even fewer liberals turn out and because they managed
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:05.240]  to kill rec and Pueblo where it was so big last year.
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.640]  You're just going to be an easier target.
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:09.240]  Absolutely truth.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:14.140]  It's if we can't get unified on this it could get real ugly
[01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:17.440]  come November and I really like my job people.
[01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:21.340]  Well, you know, you should run for some sort of office bro.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.340]  A lot of people might say can you be mayor?
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:24.240]  We don't have a mayor.
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:26.940]  I know but I mean you can be in and it makes it so much
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:28.440]  a mayor really has no power though.
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:30.240]  It needs to run for City Council.
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:35.140]  That's at large you guys tweet tweet Mike and encourage Mike
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:39.540]  to run for City Council in the city of Pueblo limit at large
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.640]  limit at large.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.140]  There we go.
[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:43.640]  Fix Logan lemon at large you guys tweet him.
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:47.140]  It's at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:47.440]  Yep.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.440]  That was correct at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter tweet him just
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:52.340]  hashtag lemon at large.
[01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:55.140]  I don't know if that's already a hashtag but and then let
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.040]  him know that you're following him through the show follow
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:57.640]  my buddy Mike.
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:58.240]  He's a great dude.
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.740]  He knows a lot about cannabis Gary.
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:01.440]  Do you have any social I'm not wrapping up the show but
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.140]  since I'm shot now Mike I feel like it's completely fair
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:05.540]  to give you a social media shout out if you'd like I know
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:07.940]  as you know, I've been recovering from a serious accident.
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:09.940]  Yes, it's good to see you back on your feet and doing well.
[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:10.740]  All right.
[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:13.340]  So, you know, this is kind of one of my first forays out.
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:16.240]  Well, then welcome to the table appointments and you know,
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.340]  necessary trips.
[01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:20.240]  He's got like a what is that like a what I can see is probably
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.040]  a good four inch gash on your forehead.
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.140]  It goes all the way to the back.
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:24.140]  Oh my gosh.
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:28.240]  I had 47 stitches and 39 staples in my head.
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:33.440]  Oh, and I've also got a cracked cervical vertebrae and a
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.040]  torn rotator cuff that haven't been even been addressed
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:38.140]  yet and the accident was in December.
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:40.240]  So it's been a long recovery.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:40.740]  Goddamn.
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:41.840]  Well, welcome back.
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:42.740]  Yeah, right on shit.
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:43.940]  I'm glad to be here.
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:45.640]  I didn't realize it was that bad through your Facebook.
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.540]  You know, you look like a soldier on Facebook.
[01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:47.740]  Yeah, right.
[01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:48.440]  Look, I got a wreck.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.440]  I got a cool scar.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.240]  I was like damn, you got fucked up.
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.440]  Yeah, it's been pretty tough.
[01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:53.840]  Oh, glad you're all right, brother.
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.040]  I know, glad you're all right, man.
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.240]  Yeah, me too.
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:57.240]  Shout out to your son.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.540]  Oh, he's doing awesome.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.640]  Straight A student.
[01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:01.240]  Yeah, very proud of that.
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.040]  He's a bright kid.
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.040]  I like hanging out with him.
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:03.640]  Great kid.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.740]  Yeah, you forget that he's a kid sometimes.
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:06.540]  Yeah.
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:07.540]  Yeah, really?
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:07.840]  Yeah.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:10.440]  All right, let's uh, no offense, but people don't want to
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:11.040]  hear about our kid.
[01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:11.840]  Absolutely not.
[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:14.440]  We should mention shout out to all the kids.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:15.740]  Yeah, raise them right.
[01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:16.840]  I hope they're not listening.
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.740]  That's why I was going to reroute this.
[01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:20.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:22.940]  But uh, we really should touch on it.
[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:26.940]  I think Mike's got to go go, uh, cough up a dab.
[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:27.240]  Yeah.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:27.640]  Yeah.
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:29.740]  I was trying to find a classier way to say that, but why don't
[01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:30.740]  we break for a second?
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:33.040]  Okay, we're gonna take a quick break and then we'll be right
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:33.240]  back.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.340]  You guys, I need a dab anyway.
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:38.840]  So we just got all high you guys and Gary decided that somebody
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:44.840]  needs to create an animated series based on my likeness and
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.240]  there is a copyright on my likeness.
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:47.340]  So you guys can't fuck with this.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:49.740]  I actually do have a trademark on my likeness.
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:51.540]  I'm not going to tell you the name of the company and everything,
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:52.540]  but that is patented.
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:55.440]  So don't try to fuck with my likeness or my name, but he just
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:59.340]  told me that I need to have a cartoon of myself and I would
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:01.740]  have the Lion of Judah as my sidekick.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.840]  So it'd be Rasta Jeff and the Lion Judah and we'd be walking
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:08.840]  around solving cannabis related mysteries and or crimes.
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:11.440]  It would be awesome, but it wouldn't be like cannabis crimes.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:13.940]  It would be like, you know, crimes against cannabis, I guess.
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:19.140]  Yo man, I see you spraying that shit on your plants while you're
[01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:20.640]  in flower boy.
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:24.640]  You can't do that to the plants when they're in flower.
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:25.940]  No, I'm not going to let them do it.
[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:27.940]  If they give me some shitty Jamaican accent.
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:31.540]  Would you want it to be me doing my own voice?
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:32.040]  I think so.
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.240]  Or would they hire like a voiceover?
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.040]  Do your own voice.
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.040]  Way more watchable if it's you.
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:39.540]  Yeah, it's your regular voice and then you know, we get a great,
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:41.640]  you know, sidekick character for the Lion.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:43.140]  It'd be perfect.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:43.840]  Oh man.
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:47.140]  So if you want to audition to be the Lion, send me an email.
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:49.940]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com or if you want to produce
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:53.440]  a fucking Rasta Jeff themed cartoon, I am down as shit.
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.340]  Let's get it on.
[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:55.540]  I want to see this happen.
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:00.940]  Shout out to Garrett Waller.
[01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:02.440]  You'd be a perfect Judah the Lion.
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:04.440]  Oh man, Garrett Waller is funny as shit.
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:04.840]  He is.
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:05.740]  He'd be a perfect Lion.
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:07.640]  We gotta see if we got chemistry or not.
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:08.740]  He kinda looks like a Lion.
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:09.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:11.840]  It's just a question of how many dabs.
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:12.240]  Right.
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:12.640]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:13.740]  What's episode number one?
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:15.340]  What are we doing in episode number one?
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.140]  What's our mystery?
[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:18.740]  If we're kind of, I'm seeing it, I'm envisioning us like as the
[01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:21.540]  ganja, more, more obviously ganja-fied Scooby-Doo.
[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:23.940]  Rasta Jeff, some motherfucker sold me some bunk-ass weed.
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:30.240]  I was thinking more like our plants got stolen.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.240]  Help us find out who took them and then you track it back like
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:34.340]  up the road or whatever.
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:38.440]  I mean, you could even go like fully educational and do like
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.440]  each episode is like a grow lesson.
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:44.740]  It's like, look, you've got, you've got might.
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:47.840]  Rasta, Judah, do cloning.
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.140]  Yeah, dude.
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:49.640]  All right.
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:51.640]  You could do it that way or you do it funny.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:54.440]  I like the mystery solving thing, but you could go education.
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:59.140]  The first incarnation of this was much more Scooby-Doo than it
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:33:59.740]  is.
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:03.640]  Then it's got an educational Rosenthal, but I think it could be both.
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:04.240]  It could.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:05.040]  It definitely could.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.940]  You should go watch the Mike Tyson mysteries.
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:07.540]  Have you seen them?
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:08.840]  Those are hilarious.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:11.240]  That's what I'm thinking when I see this.
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:11.640]  Okay.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:12.540]  It's just replacing you.
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:14.140]  It's great, dude.
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:14.940]  You'll like it.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:17.940]  So if anybody wants to kind of replace the Mike Tyson mysteries
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:20.640]  with me and my lion Judah, I'm game.
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:21.440]  I want to see it happen.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.540]  I want to see me and I would like to see it.
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:24.240]  Fighting crime.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.240]  Can I be a superhero?
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:26.940]  Can we give me, do I have a superpower?
[01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:28.040]  I'm just the point.
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.040]  I think you can have powers.
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:30.940]  I can talk to play.
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:32.440]  That's the thing about cartoons.
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:33.340]  The blood whisperer.
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:35.340]  If you can have powers, you know, it's okay.
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:35.840]  Yeah.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.340]  Because they don't have to be Judah can certainly have powers.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:38.940]  Okay.
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:39.440]  Yeah.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.040]  Yeah.
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:44.240]  I like that version better where you can be super high and the
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:45.440]  line can be a superhero.
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:46.340]  Right?
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:47.340]  I don't want to be tally.
[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:49.940]  I'll say that the whole thing is it's easy to be tally.
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:52.240]  I think there'd be like a whole question of whether the line is
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:53.040]  real or not.
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:54.540]  You know what I mean?
[01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:55.740]  So it's kind of Wilfred like now.
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:58.240]  So I was just about to say don't go Wilfred.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:58.840]  No, no, no.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.440]  Not that far, but you know what I mean?
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.940]  He's your sidekick, but you know, suddenly he's only there when
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:05.840]  I'm blazed.
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:10.540]  That's we don't ever show me smoking or talk about me smoking,
[01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:13.140]  but only when I'm obviously high Judah shows up.
[01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:14.340]  Judah, we need your help.
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:14.840]  Yeah.
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:18.540]  That's 70 showed it a little bit.
[01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:19.040]  Yeah.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.240]  Somebody asked me a question that I don't know the answer to him.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:21.840]  Like, I don't know.
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:24.640]  Let me go find Judah and then I come back with Judah and I've
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:25.440]  got the answer.
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:29.440]  But those elements like the 70 show element, the Mike Tyson
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:32.540]  mysteries element and the Scooby-Doo elements.
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:35.440]  If you could, you know, work those in will make it even funnier
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:37.140]  because it's you know, these are hashtag.
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:38.540]  They like it when we ramble.
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:39.240]  Yes, they do.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:39.840]  All right, you guys.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.040]  So it's just one fucking dabbed out beautiful.
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:42.440]  I love it.
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:43.840]  We can edit that if you want to.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:44.740]  No, I'm not editing.
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:45.540]  That's beautiful.
[01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:47.440]  This is podcasting at its finest.
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.440]  Welcome to the table.
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:48.840]  You guys.
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:52.040]  This is what three dudes that have had too many dabs sit around
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.340]  and talk about too many.
[01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:54.740]  Not just enough too many.
[01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:56.640]  I could probably go for one more but I don't want to blow out
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:59.040]  the throat and try to record but that right right right voice.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:35:59.440]  Right?
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:01.740]  Once you guys get talking, I might take a dab.
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:06.840]  So recently the DEA has announced that they are going to
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:11.340]  investigate cannabis a little further and within 90 days, they
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:16.140]  will release their opinion on it rather they decide to reschedule
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:18.240]  cannabis as a schedule.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.840]  I have an article on the thing here because I'm no good with
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:20.440]  the scheduling.
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:21.740]  I get the numbers mixed up.
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.640]  They're going to reschedule cannabis.
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:27.840]  Right now is it is currently listed as a schedule one drug
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:30.540]  meaning that for the purposes of federal law, the drug has no
[01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:33.840]  medical value and a high potential for abuse and is one of the
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:37.040]  most dangerous drugs of all drug schedules with potentially
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:40.940]  severe psychological or physical dependence.
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:44.440]  Okay, that right there poses a really big problem for the
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:45.040]  government.
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:49.740]  Yes, because a different branch of the government owns a patent
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.940]  for medical uses of cannabis.
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:55.740]  So how can it have no medical uses and you own the patent?
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:58.340]  They've been comfortable with that bit of hypocrisy for a
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:59.540]  really long time.
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:03.840]  But there's a case working its way through the courts that is
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.440]  challenging that very issue.
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:08.940]  Yep, that one of them has basically been waiting for a decade
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:10.340]  to see this come to fruition.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:16.940]  So there this move is ahead of it and my initial thought on this
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:21.640]  move was this is an establishment Democrat move to take some
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:22.940]  wind out of Bernie Sanders.
[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:26.840]  If they reschedule before the election.
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:31.440]  That kind of removes a key issue for Sanders.
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:34.740]  The reason we highlighted Sanders on this podcast.
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:36.440]  You see what I mean?
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:42.340]  As an establishment Democrat move, it's kind of brilliant.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:47.340]  I was just expecting the DEA to swat this down like they have
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:48.040]  every time.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:53.240]  But because they've that we've gotten to this point in the DEA
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:54.940]  trying to reschedule it before.
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:55.740]  True.
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:58.840]  And honestly, I haven't kept up as much as I should have with
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.440]  this current incarnation of it, but I would be surprised if
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:03.040]  that.
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:05.440]  But it could be I don't know.
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:08.640]  So you think they're giving up the Queen to save the King?
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:12.640]  Well, look socially the tide has turned.
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:14.240]  Everybody knows that.
[01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:14.840]  Yes.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:16.940]  It's just a matter of with the number of states that have
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:19.540]  legalized all of the things that are changing.
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:20.840]  It is definitely obvious.
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:24.940]  We've seen the DNC the Democratic establishment do all
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:27.240]  kinds of shit to Sanders.
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:28.540]  You know what I mean?
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:30.540]  It kind of fits the profile.
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:32.240]  I'm not trying to be a conspiracy theorist.
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:35.440]  I just see a massive political value.
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:40.340]  For Hillary Clinton, if it happens before the election,
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:43.640]  there's a huge political value for her if it happens before
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:45.740]  the election and that's undeniable.
[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:46.640]  I can see that.
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:46.940]  All right.
[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:50.640]  So whether it's intentional or unintentional now, I agree
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:51.240]  with Mike.
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:56.840]  I think that in under normal circumstances, this is just
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.940]  the DA is going to you know, shuffle some papers around and
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:00.540]  fuck you.
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:01.640]  It's bullshit.
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:06.840]  They've literally been taken to federal court and lost and
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:07.440]  still not done it.
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:08.940]  Still still not gonna pull it.
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:09.440]  Yeah, right.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:14.340]  Yeah, they're their own DEA law judge like when the original
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:18.740]  federal medical program was created to citizens sued the
[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:23.840]  feds one and then the DA law judge that overheard the case
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:26.140]  recommended that the DEA reschedule marijuana.
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:29.940]  Their response was to basically shame him into retirement.
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:33.240]  Well, but and what you have to understand and what we all
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:37.840]  have to acknowledge here is that they are fully under the
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.340]  control of the executive branch.
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:42.440]  So the president ordered them to do that or they wouldn't
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.040]  have done it period.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:47.940]  Like if the president ordered them not to do it, they wouldn't
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:51.440]  have done more than likely more than likely and and you know,
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:52.640]  all probabilities.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:56.740]  Okay, so that's the difference right now.
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:40:00.640]  So the the implications are really weird, right?
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:02.640]  So they have several options.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:07.140]  They could do nothing and and very possibly they could do
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:07.540]  nothing.
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:10.740]  That's basically what I expected to see happen was this to
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:13.440]  come up again and then to say yeah, no.
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:16.040]  And that could happen that could be the answer right?
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:18.340]  And that's that tends to be the federal response when it
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:21.740]  comes to marijuana is right under normal shake their head
[01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:24.440]  and say no and if things go on the way they have under normal
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:25.440]  circumstances.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:26.840]  That's what we would all expect.
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:29.940]  Would they have even bothered to announce it if they weren't
[01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:30.940]  going to do something?
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:32.040]  They didn't have to tell us.
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:34.140]  It's true that that's the thing.
[01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:39.240]  I mean the pressure the story that I did glance at I don't
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:42.340]  think they announced it quite as intention like they didn't
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:45.240]  mean for this to happen because a number of different news
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:46.840]  agencies are talking about it.
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:51.140]  Somebody had like an ad forwarded the wrong email to the
[01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:55.740]  wrong person and we're going to be looking at this between
[01:40:55.740 --> 01:40:57.240]  now and what is it August?
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:03.040]  Yeah memo was leaked to I want to say it was Matt for near
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:04.040]  but I'm not positive.
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:09.040]  And so yeah, I'm not sure that this was a intended to be as
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.240]  public publicized as it has been but who knows they
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:15.340]  should get leaked on purpose to yes, exactly.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:17.640]  Well, thanks to whoever leaked it and you know the material
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:21.240]  they could have leaked it to you know, kind of test public
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.640]  sentiment on it, you know, right?
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:24.140]  See how it's going to fly.
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:25.940]  Yeah, you know like a comedian tweets a joke.
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:26.640]  That's what they do.
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:29.740]  You know, he's tweeted the joke if they do nothing then, you
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:34.040]  know, we're where we are nothing changes except that whoever
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:38.240]  the next president is then has the authority to come and shut
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:41.740]  all this shit down if they want to under federal law.
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:47.140]  And don't kid yourself Trump will do that his whole campaign
[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:50.940]  sparks of that man, you know, it's it's his whole campaign
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:53.840]  is insane and it doesn't surprise me that you're having
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:54.540]  Trump nightmares.
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:57.040]  I think a lot of people are yeah, I agree.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.840]  Well pretty actually.
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:41:59.340]  All right.
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:04.240]  So the DEA could possibly come out and say hey, this does
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:06.140]  have medicinal value we could have.
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:06.440]  Yeah.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:06.740]  All right.
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:11.640]  So yeah, so option one do nothing and that's probably what
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:14.340]  the consensus what everybody expects, right?
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:19.140]  But option two is they reschedule which means it goes somewhere
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:23.340]  between two and five on the on the schedule right list.
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:28.840]  Okay, and that puts it under the jurisdiction of the FDA.
[01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:36.140]  So now if it's scheduled anywhere below one, it's under FDA.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:37.740]  So what does that mean?
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:42.440]  Well, even if it drops the two a lot of good things happen
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:46.140]  a lot of good things and a lot of strange things happen because
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:49.440]  I mean we've spent an amazingly long time trying to figure
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:53.540]  out how to make it to punitive for people to risk smoking
[01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:57.040]  or having weed and all of those rules are still in place
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:58.640]  even in places like Colorado.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:02.440]  So rescheduling it anywhere on the schedule still leaves
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.040]  some really interesting questions.
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:05.040]  It really really does.
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:07.440]  Well, like I said in putting it anywhere on the schedule.
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:10.240]  Makes it under the authority of the FDA.
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:16.240]  So that leaves a whole bunch of questions of how and how
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.840]  would that even begin to work because it's not a typical
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:20.940]  pharmaceutical what I predicted me.
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:22.840]  I don't know if I've said this on an episode before what
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:27.140]  I predict unfortunately, maybe if we do go to a national,
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:29.440]  I thought it would be medical first, but it looks like we
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:32.540]  may have a national recreational program already done that
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:35.440]  they'll find somebody right.
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.540]  Okay, holy shit.
[01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:37.040]  You're correct.
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:39.240]  We have they're going to find somebody to grow it and
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.940]  then it's not going to be something friendly.
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:43.240]  It's going to be a mass-produced product that is going to
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:45.040]  be and they're going to wipe out all the small grows like
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:46.140]  what we've got going now.
[01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:50.340]  See, it's just not happening that it's not happening that
[01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:51.440]  way. You know what I mean?
[01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:56.940]  That's a top-down kind of affectation of political change,
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:58.140]  right? And it's not happening.
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:01.440]  It's happening from the bottom up on the state level a third
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:03.540]  option. They have rather than rescheduling.
[01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:06.640]  They could de-listed they could de-schedule completely.
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:11.540]  And they could even go so far as to recommend that, you know,
[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:18.440]  although it's de-listed and not a scheduled drug that it needs
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:19.540]  special care.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.840]  So the ATF could become the ATFC.
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:24.940]  I mean literally.
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:28.340]  Yeah, I think they'd use marijuana instead of cannabis in
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:29.040]  their acronym.
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:32.940]  I wish they wouldn't but that's totally on the list of
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:33.940]  possibilities.
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:39.140]  Well, and some of the analysis that I read the policy analysis
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:44.240]  that if you look at, you know, kind of the recent history of
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:48.840]  structuring government, this would probably be the way they
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:55.440]  would do because of integration with like Homeland Security
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:57.740]  ATF is already fully integrated.
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:03.440]  And so in this transition period where we're going from illegal
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:08.640]  to legal the ATF would be able to monitor the legal grows and
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.840]  keep out cartels and stuff like that.
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:14.540]  And then their role would diminish as it has with alcohol,
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:18.840]  you know, the ATF was heavy in regulation when alcohol first
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:22.540]  became legal and then they've, you know, eased off on alcohol
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:24.940]  and others and it was a similar point.
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:26.940]  It's just regulated like anything else.
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:30.740]  The state regulatory agency has inspectors the inspectors come
[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:33.340]  by and check stuff with something like this.
[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:37.540]  It's a retail distributed intoxicant like there'd be the occasional
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:41.140]  ID sting but it's really not that complicated to turn it into
[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:42.640]  a product just like anything else.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:43.240]  Exactly.
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:46.740]  And that's what de-scheduling it and putting it under the ATF
[01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:49.240]  jurisdiction would do and it would solve the government's
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:52.540]  problem worry about cartels getting in and stuff like that
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:55.140]  because then they could go to every state and inspect them.
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:56.040]  Right.
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:56.540]  See what I mean?
[01:45:56.540 --> 01:46:00.240]  Yeah, and without even having to put any regulations on it, you
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:04.040]  know, just just looking for money laundering and tax evasion
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:05.540]  and stuff like that, you know what I mean?
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:08.140]  Like they do with the ATF does with alcohol.
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:10.840]  They only do the top level alcohol stuff, you know what I mean?
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:13.740]  Do you think anybody else has thought this idea through or
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:14.740]  do you think this is something you're thinking?
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:17.440]  Well, I didn't just make this shit up, you know, I went out
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:21.040]  and read smarter people than me and this is what they think.
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:24.640]  I think the odds of them de-scheduling cannabis in the next
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:28.340]  couple months is around like one or two or three percent at
[01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:33.940]  most. If the DEA does anything it will likely be lower the
[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:36.840]  schedule a point or two.
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:40.940]  So down to schedule two or three which we can debate for a
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:44.840]  really long time if it belongs on the schedule at all or and
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:49.540]  if so where but I really don't think the DEA is going to do
[01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:52.540]  anything because that's historically what they've always done
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:53.440]  is just nothing.
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:58.240]  Well, and the marijuana is too big a piece of the drug war
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:02.440]  pie. We're 80% of all drug consumers, all illicit drug consumers
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:03.740]  only consume cannabis.
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:07.140]  You take cannabis out of that equation and they've got a real
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:09.340]  hard time justifying a lot of their budgets.
[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:09.940]  True.
[01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:13.340]  And that's why they spend so many times flying around or so
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:15.640]  much time flying around shopping down cannabis plants in the
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:16.040]  woods.
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:22.840]  It's because they if they don't they don't get paid and like.
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:27.340]  So if they do federally regulate it to another schedule is
[01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:29.740]  my going to have to become a pharmacist basically now to be
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:30.440]  a bud tender.
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:33.840]  Am I going to have to wear a lab coat and go a little bit
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:37.040]  more extreme and get major some sort of pharmaceutical
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.840]  accreditation.
[01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:43.940]  I think it wouldn't change state laws, but it would give the
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:47.740]  FDA an opportunity to basically do whatever they want.
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:54.540]  It depending on where it falls on the schedule bud tending
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:56.140]  would still be a federal offense.
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:47:58.140]  Depending.
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:04.240]  Yeah, and but even if it moved to just schedule to the ability
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:09.840]  for doctors to research it would increase greatly like one of
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:12.840]  the main hurdles right now is like if you get your whole study
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:13.740]  approved.
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:16.440]  There's only one small place where you can get the cannabis
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:20.540]  from if you watch Sanjay Gupta's marijuana specials, you can
[01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:23.140]  check out where that place is and what it's all about.
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:26.740]  But the supply is still drastically limited and with the
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:30.440]  number of different compounds in the cannabis plant the number
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:33.940]  of different medical applications that people in our industry
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:37.240]  have seen hinted at but would like further research on all of
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:39.540]  those studies get a lot easier to do.
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:42.940]  Oh, yeah, even if it only moves colleges can do the research.
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:47.540]  Even if it only moves to two it opens up everything basically.
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:50.340]  Yeah, everything as far as research goes.
[01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:51.840]  Yeah, that door really opens.
[01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:55.040]  Would we be able to study cannabis at the University of
[01:48:55.140 --> 01:48:57.840]  Southern Colorado Apollo Colorado State University Apollo?
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:48:58.340]  Okay.
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:48:58.840]  Absolutely.
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:48:59.240]  All right.
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:00.440]  Yep.
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:04.940]  And I mean, I really don't think the DEA is going to move on this
[01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:09.440]  if the federal government moves in my opinion it will because
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:15.540]  an acting president rallies Congress just like they do on countless
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:20.240]  other issues using the bully pulpit and it will be a long drawn-out
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:24.740]  process is my opinion, but who knows the DEA could jump for all
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:25.640]  kinds of reasons.
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:31.140]  Well, the analysis that I read and this was policy analysis from
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:32.940]  Pew Research.
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:38.640]  Yeah, they're there take on it is right now.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:43.240]  Nobody knows what's going to happen in this election cycle that
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:46.640]  you know, basically everybody's pulling out all the stops and
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:50.740]  all bets are off right and that you know, the benefit here, you
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:54.440]  know in this in this situation or Clinton could could be the
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:57.340]  tipping point could be the thing that does after all these fucking
[01:49:57.340 --> 01:49:58.740]  years, you know what I mean?
[01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:03.640]  And and you know, sadly he gave about five examples.
[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:05.540]  That's how shit works in this country.
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:06.740]  You know what I mean?
[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:10.940]  Fortunately, you know, there's there's enough support out there
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:15.640]  that it could get done without too much turmoil now, you know,
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:19.940]  yeah that it could fly you could do it and we've seen Obama's a
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:20.440]  lame duck.
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:22.840]  He's got nothing to lose true.
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:23.840]  He's on his way out.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:25.740]  He is doors about to close on his ass.
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.240]  They've never said a nice word about him before.
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:32.240]  Why does he doesn't give a fuck what the opponents think true?
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:39.540]  So, you know, we were talking about to election vote situations
[01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:43.140]  where about a hundred people vote voice their concern on one way
[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:45.740]  and two or three people stood up and voice their concern on the
[01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:46.440]  opposition.
[01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:50.040]  And for some reason the council members went with the lower votes
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:51.040]  in both cases.
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:55.040]  So then Colorado Springs recently on two very different issues,
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:57.040]  very different issues, but it was the same damn way.
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:59.940]  Well, we're seeing we're seeing here in Seller, Colorado.
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:03.140]  We're seeing the culture war like really starting to bubble up.
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:07.240]  You know, we're seeing this movement this whatever it is movement
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:08.240]  against marijuana.
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:12.540]  We're seeing the City Council and Colorado Springs taking all
[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:18.140]  kinds of actions that are just really opposed to public outcry.
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:21.740]  And like one of those is on marijuana, but there were other
[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:24.940]  issues like completely unrelated to marijuana where the public
[01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:28.240]  was, you know, really vocal on it and they still move like
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:30.740]  directly against right away and with the other way.
[01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:37.340]  And it's you know, it's it's getting thick around here man.
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:40.240]  And and you know, it's kind of getting thick nationally too.
[01:51:40.340 --> 01:51:40.840]  Right?
[01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:45.940]  And you know, it's I mean politics goes in cycles.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:49.240]  I mean pull out a history book or just if you're older think
[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:53.740]  back it goes liberal conservative liberal conservative and it
[01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:55.540]  has for the last hundred years.
[01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:58.140]  Well, and we saw Reagan.
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:06.440]  True, but it's getting more and more conservative right now
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:09.040]  because it got more and more liberal for a minute.
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:12.540]  We made some nice progress on some nice issues.
[01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:15.840]  But at the same time the conservative folks the anti-pot
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:19.640]  groups, they've been getting clobbered in election after
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:23.340]  election and Council meeting after Council meeting and license
[01:52:23.340 --> 01:52:26.340]  hearing after license hearing and they're pissed.
[01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:27.140]  Absolutely.
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:28.040]  I'm motivated.
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:31.740]  So down here they're going with a nuclear option and it kind
[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:36.540]  of seems like they are nationally to given Trump's popularity.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:42.540]  Yeah, but if more people don't get active and I mean that
[01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:43.840]  takes paying attention.
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:45.040]  It takes some dedication.
[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:48.340]  It takes reading the news occasionally.
[01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:50.140]  It takes staying informed.
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:53.240]  It's not something that you can just do overnight.
[01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:57.940]  But if more people are age and more people that aren't into
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:53:00.840]  cannabis don't start getting involved like it could get real
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:04.040]  ugly for the next couple of years eight years at least.
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:09.140]  Register and vote register and vote the I was gonna I was going
[01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:11.440]  to say the ball is in your hands, but that just sounds gross
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:14.540]  vote your conscience on the presidential candidate.
[01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:16.740]  But support the cannabis industry.
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:18.040]  Yes, please do.
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:19.940]  Absolutely everyone at this table.
[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:21.840]  I realize heavily in the cannabis industry.
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:23.340]  It's the legal cannabis industry.
[01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:24.640]  That's something I want to add.
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:26.640]  I come from the black market.
[01:53:26.740 --> 01:53:29.040]  I come from the dark side of this industry.
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:32.240]  If there weren't a legal cannabis market, you know where I
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:35.140]  would be you'd probably still be part of the black market.
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:37.540]  I'd be crushing the black market just like I used to do.
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:37.940]  Yeah.
[01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:38.340]  Yep.
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:40.840]  And now that I've got a legitimate job.
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.740]  I pay a lot of damn taxes.
[01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:44.640]  I have a time clock now.
[01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:46.240]  I'm doing everything legit.
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:50.240]  I've got got manifests and invoices for every grandma product.
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:51.040]  I produce now.
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:53.540]  It was I watched it happen.
[01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:57.040]  I I spent a lot of time kind of in the gray world working for
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:03.140]  caregivers and one by one the dried up because it was too much
[01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:03.640]  of a hassle.
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:07.140]  Now, there's not enough profit in Colorado because most of that's
[01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:10.340]  going to legal market now Mike and I got to watch the whole
[01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:11.240]  thing shift.
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:12.040]  Yep.
[01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:15.140]  But you want got to watch it take long either the street to the
[01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:18.140]  caregiver model to the kind of a dispensary to the sketchy ass
[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:19.440]  dispensary to the okay.
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:21.640]  That's a dispensary to holy shit.
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:22.640]  This is regular shit.
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:23.140]  We have now.
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:24.440]  Yeah, it's where we are now.
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:24.840]  Right?
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:26.140]  Yeah, it's a club clubs.
[01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:26.540]  Yeah.
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:27.540]  Yeah.
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:30.640]  So shout out to all the people and this is mainly all of the
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:31.440]  mics out there.
[01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:33.040]  Mike is part of a team.
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:33.640]  I'm part of a team.
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:35.940]  I get all the glory because I've got a show with my face on the
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:36.540]  fucking label.
[01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:38.140]  I've got a seed company that I hype a lot.
[01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:40.040]  I've got the Instagram that everybody checks out.
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:40.940]  I'm the voice.
[01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:43.940]  I'm the face but there are for every one of me there are three
[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:45.640]  or four people supporting what I do.
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:47.540]  I know that it's not just me that's able to do it.
[01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:49.140]  So I'm going to give Mike a fist bump because he's the closest
[01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:51.040]  one to me but that fist bump is for all the people that make
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:53.740]  this shit possible because it's not just a one-man effort.
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:56.440]  I get all the Facebook and Instagram love but it's all you
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:55:00.240]  guys also so no, we're a huge community guys.
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:00.640]  Don't get it.
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:03.140]  I was organized Mike's been there since the beginning with
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:07.440]  me fucking Mike help me try to spend a lot of years back in
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:08.140]  the day.
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:11.240]  Back in the way day.
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:13.840]  Do you remember when your girl room was like a hundred?
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.040]  Okay, let's not even go here.
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:16.440]  Let's not even go here.
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:16.940]  We're not wearing.
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:19.440]  I remember when it was three foot by three foot buddy.
[01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:19.940]  Yeah.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:20.440]  Huh?
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:22.540]  I remember when you could bake potatoes on the floor that
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:23.040]  bitch.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:25.940]  We probably tried in the learning days.
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:27.240]  The learning days were fun.
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:31.740]  Yeah, a lot of a lot of years of experience a lot of battles
[01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:32.740]  that were fought.
[01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:36.040]  I mean years before the show started going to making it and
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:40.440]  giving you guys I mean law decades worth of lessons.
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:44.340]  If you're still listening like you had to fail.
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:46.340]  I had to fail a thousand times to learn the hundred things
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:47.040]  that I learned.
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:48.640]  I didn't fail so many times.
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:51.740]  I had to sit through hundreds ounces hours of council meetings
[01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:54.440]  hundred ounces hundred out hundred ounce council meetings
[01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:58.440]  hundreds of hours of council meetings watching how pro watching
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:55:59.540]  the process happen.
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:04.040]  Yeah, watching we went to our friends or try happen.
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:04.340]  Yep.
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:08.640]  Watch all the action on cultivation of a large farm when
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:10.540]  supported that and learned a lot.
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:10.940]  Yep.
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:13.740]  I mean just going through and watching it took up.
[01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:18.840]  I mean hundreds of hours it just so that now that all of this
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:23.040]  is going down we can be active in it like it takes work but
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:25.640]  come from the dark side you guys come into the the legal
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:28.440]  regulated market pay some taxes much better bro.
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:31.640]  Now I was able to go to a car dealership and they're like,
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:32.440]  so what do you do for work?
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:34.440]  I was like, I have a pay stub and I work at a legitimate
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:37.140]  place and they're like, oh, we'll give you fat credit instead
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:37.940]  of like, what do you do?
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:38.940]  I'm going to pay cash.
[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:42.140]  Can I just buy a car and looking sketchy like it felt way
[01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:44.440]  better just walk in there and be like look at have like a
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:45.440]  real line of work.
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:46.740]  It felt really nice.
[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:49.740]  So just come from the dark side join the regulated market
[01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:52.540]  get legit don't hide don't have to look over your shoulder
[01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:52.940]  all the time.
[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:54.940]  Don't be a eyesore on the movement.
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:58.940]  I see people there'll be a legalization effort running in
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:02.440]  their area and they'll be fighting it because it's not
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:03.940]  enough in their eyes.
[01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:07.640]  And if you look at Colorado's rules and how it all hashed
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:10.840]  out like it's not enough in our eyes, right?
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:11.840]  We didn't get clubs.
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:15.240]  Clubs are a big issue, but they're not even close to the
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:15.840]  only issue.
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:17.740]  We I mean, it's not enough yet.
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:21.040]  It's just not but the reality of the situation is it's the
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:22.340]  best situation scenario.
[01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:25.640]  Anyone's got on the planet by miles.
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:29.440]  There are a couple of states coming up behind us that might
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:33.840]  end up in similar positions cannabis wise, but is a consumer
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:37.640]  is a patient as a member of the community like I can't see
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:40.840]  it getting much better than this right now.
[01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:43.940]  Not for us.
[01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:47.440]  The only thing that can really improve for us is pricing and
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:48.440]  that that comes in time.
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:50.440]  We watch that happen with the medical market.
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:51.540]  It just takes time.
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:56.440]  As more states legalizes the tourism industry dips down a
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:58:00.540]  little bit is more shops open as competition gets better is
[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:02.540]  talent people become more talented.
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:06.240]  There's a lot of brother-in-laws that got hired to grow a lot
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:09.840]  of warehouse weed and it didn't come out so hot for some of
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:10.040]  them.
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:13.440]  Well, yeah growers still tend to be a problem for dispensers.
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:17.040]  I want to predict a cannabis shortage this summer.
[01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:19.240]  It's been happening.
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:23.840]  This state estimates were a ton or more under consumption for
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:24.940]  our production right now.
[01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:27.040]  So we're not even close to meeting demand.
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:28.440]  Can I bust out a humble brag?
[01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:31.340]  I run an 80 we have 85.
[01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:35.340]  Oh, I heard these no 85 lights in the flowering room and I
[01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:40.640]  pulled 200 and I think 217 ish pounds is what I think I remember
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:40.940]  reading.
[01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:41.440]  Wow.
[01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:44.240]  Yeah, 217 and a half pounds or something.
[01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:45.240]  I saw your boss.
[01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:46.640]  I'm going to that social media.
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:49.340]  Yeah, I don't remember the exact number because I saw this over
[01:58:49.340 --> 01:58:50.940]  to yeah, I saw that.
[01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:53.440]  I remember thinking 237 with that might just be a number.
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:54.140]  I made up my head.
[01:58:54.140 --> 01:58:55.140]  That sounds close.
[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:56.040]  So somewhere around there.
[01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:56.540]  Yeah.
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:00.540]  Yeah, I could go look but I'm it's I'm high as shit.
[01:59:00.540 --> 01:59:01.540]  So that number is gone in my head.
[01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:06.240]  But yeah between 215 and 230 something pounds of usable cannabis
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:07.840]  underneath 85 lights.
[01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:12.140]  We pulled about 2.2 pounds per light is what I think we math
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:12.340]  that out.
[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:15.640]  Maybe 2.5 or something like that is what I did the math on.
[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:20.840]  So yeah, I'll do what I can to produce those tonnages of cannabis
[01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:23.340]  that we need for the summer you guys but I can't promise you that
[01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:24.240]  it'll all be out there.
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:25.840]  Let's see everybody got to do their part.
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:29.540]  Yeah, do what you can push push out 200 something pounds from 85
[01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:29.940]  lights.
[01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:31.140]  That should be inspiring.
[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:34.340]  Like just look at the table for a second and then think back to
[01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:37.840]  10 years ago because that's where they are in Louisiana, Texas,
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:38.640]  New York.
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:40.640]  Yeah, I mean countless other states.
[01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:43.140]  So they're where we are 10 or 15 years ago.
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:44.440]  I'm going to give them five or six years.
[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:45.040]  I don't know about 10.
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:47.840]  A lot of the dab thing is catching on the internet moves us more
[01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:50.940]  quickly and people travel a lot more and I'm going to blame a lot
[01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:56.840]  of things on the traveling of jam bands and the music scene when
[01:59:57.140 --> 01:59:58.440]  widespread goes on tour.
[01:59:58.440 --> 01:59:59.140]  They're going to stop.
[01:59:59.140 --> 02:00:01.840]  I think they're in Austin this week people that traveled from
[02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:04.740]  Colorado to Austin are introduced and I'm sure Austin's already
[02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:08.340]  got dabs and shit, but they're introducing more people to shatter
[02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:08.740]  right now.
[02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:11.940]  They're after the widespread show right now some of that's made
[02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:12.340]  it out.
[02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:17.140]  But like law wise what happens if you get caught with it like in
[02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:21.240]  Ohio or a number of those middle states that nobody thinks about
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:21.940]  a lot.
[02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:28.240]  I'm sorry, Ohio, but there's there's a lot of states where having
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:30.340]  cannabis is a major offense.
[02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:32.040]  It doesn't matter if you're sick.
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:33.640]  It doesn't matter if you have cancer.
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:35.940]  It doesn't matter if you've got Crohn's disease.
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:37.440]  They'll take your kids.
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:38.640]  They'll take your house.
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:40.040]  Shout out to my crew from Ohio.
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:43.640]  Listen, but I got a crew that's from Ohio that listen.
[02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:45.140]  So shout out to all them kids.
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:46.840]  Look who what up brother?
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:50.440]  Like when I was in Louisiana a year ago, I watched somebody get
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.840]  like grabbed and thrown to the ground for smoking a joint.
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:55.940]  Yeah, handcuffed and thrown in the back of the squad car like
[02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:56.940]  in Party City.
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:02.940]  It's no joke a lot of places in the laws move slow, Louisiana
[02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:04.240]  just changed their laws though.
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:08.240]  And it's a interesting they seem to be on the road to legalization
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:09.940]  very very slowly.
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:15.440]  Well, they the current regs are up to two and a half pounds
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:19.340]  is a misdemeanor in your possession and a transfer of up to
[02:01:19.340 --> 02:01:21.240]  an ounce to another adult is a misdemeanor.
[02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:25.140]  They've got one of the worst three strikes laws in the country
[02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:28.740]  though, but you can pretty much walk out of their jail from
[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:29.840]  what I've seen on YouTube.
[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:32.740]  You pretty much just get up and leave if you feel like.
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:37.340]  Yeah, it's not something you want to play with in a lot of
[02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:37.940]  places.
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:40.340]  In the last slow to change.
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:43.940]  Sorry to cough into the microphone you guys dad's are happening
[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:44.140]  here.
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:45.440]  Riggs going back around.
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:47.540]  Yeah, Mike you got skipped because you cough a lot but I'm
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:49.140]  going to give you one as we start wrapping up the show.
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:50.140]  It'll come back this way.
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:50.740]  There we go.
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:51.940]  Don't take it personally.
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:53.940]  I never do hashtag.
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:56.440]  We like it when they like it when we I forgot what it is.
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:57.440]  I like it when you ramble.
[02:01:58.340 --> 02:01:58.740]  Yeah.
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:03.440]  We're all joking and kind of a crazy show.
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:04.540]  We've got some weird places.
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:06.840]  Yeah, we're almost an hour and we're over an hour and 10 minutes
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:09.340]  and so anybody have anything important?
[02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:11.040]  They want to wrap up a podcast with
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:15.640]  how about everybody make their prediction for the election?
[02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:19.540]  It will be the nominee for it is too early for that shit.
[02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:21.140]  This we're on preseason.
[02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:22.540]  You can't make me call the Super Bowl.
[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:25.140]  Who do you think will be the nominees?
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:28.340]  That's still too early to call.
[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:29.840]  Yeah, I don't think they're going to give it to Trump.
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:30.440]  I really don't.
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:31.640]  I really don't.
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:33.140]  I really really don't.
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:37.340]  I'm waiting to see the country flip out when the guy who gets
[02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:39.740]  the most votes doesn't get the nomination because
[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:43.340]  did you can't put the crazy person in the room with the
[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:43.940]  button.
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:45.140]  Exactly.
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:45.540]  It's
[02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:49.840]  there's no way the RNC lets that happen.
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:53.840]  But assholes, they're fucking anti-american in my opinion,
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:55.540]  but they're not that fucking stupid.
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:56.940]  No, it
[02:02:58.340 --> 02:02:59.040]  the same point.
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:03.040]  They haven't put to put forward a contender Trump a Trump presidency.
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:05.840]  Create so much uncertainty our economy.
[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:11.640]  This is they've been stepping to step into the right big step
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:13.540]  by big step for the last 20 years.
[02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:15.740]  And this is what happens when you step off the cliff at the
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:20.240]  end of the red side that paired with the systematic defunding
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:21.440]  of public education.
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:22.940]  Yeah, it's a problem.
[02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:27.340]  Yeah, I usually keep my mouth shut on politics, but if
[02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:31.240]  if Trump is afraid of Megyn Kelly, how's he going to fucking
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:32.040]  deal with Isis?
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:36.240]  That's a good that's a good.
[02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:38.440]  All right, we're wrapping up the show you guys make sure you
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:40.740]  follow all of us on all of the social media that we've got.

[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:53.120]  It's time for episode number 128 of the girl from your heart
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:57.720]  podcast your source for cannabis news education and conversation.
[02:11:58.420 --> 02:11:58.620]  It's right.
[02:11:58.620 --> 02:11:59.420]  If you're a new grower,
[02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:00.620]  if you're a professional grower,
[02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:02.720]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:05.220]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just
[02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:07.120]  curious about the current state of cannabis,
[02:12:07.220 --> 02:12:10.120]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:12.420]  I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:13.320]  As always,
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:14.920]  I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:16.920]  in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:17.620]  on my show.
[02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:18.820]  Big shout out to Kat,
[02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:21.420]  Koon and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[02:12:27.090 --> 02:12:28.090]  I didn't cough into the mic.
[02:12:28.090 --> 02:12:28.990]  Nothing happened there.
[02:12:29.190 --> 02:12:31.490]  I never knew you did that freehand.
[02:12:31.490 --> 02:12:33.890]  I always figured that was pre-recorded and plugged in.
[02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.290]  Oh, no,
[02:12:34.290 --> 02:12:35.590]  I do that at every episode.
[02:12:35.590 --> 02:12:36.890]  Sometimes I cough in the middle of it.
[02:12:36.890 --> 02:12:38.390]  This time I had something in the mustache that was
[02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:39.090]  going to make me sneeze,
[02:12:39.090 --> 02:12:39.990]  but I got through it.
[02:12:40.290 --> 02:12:41.490]  You guys that voice joining me.
[02:12:41.490 --> 02:12:44.290]  You might recognize that deep sexy soulful voice over there.
[02:12:44.290 --> 02:12:45.490]  That Barry White guy over there.
[02:12:45.890 --> 02:12:46.490]  That's a good friend.
[02:12:46.490 --> 02:12:46.790]  Jesse.
[02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:47.490]  Thanks for joining us,
[02:12:47.490 --> 02:12:47.790]  bro.
[02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:48.190]  Yeah,
[02:12:48.190 --> 02:12:48.690]  for sure.
[02:12:48.690 --> 02:12:49.690]  Welcome to the show.
[02:12:49.690 --> 02:12:50.190]  Oh man,
[02:12:50.190 --> 02:12:51.890]  any anytime you want to be here.
[02:12:52.590 --> 02:12:53.790]  This is a great episode to have you.
[02:12:53.790 --> 02:12:57.190]  I just realized that these episodes are kind of recorded.
[02:12:57.190 --> 02:12:58.290]  We do two a week.
[02:12:58.290 --> 02:13:00.290]  Sometimes we'll do three a week and then I won't do
[02:13:00.290 --> 02:13:02.190]  one for a couple weeks and then we'll put one out.
[02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:03.590]  They come out once a week,
[02:13:03.590 --> 02:13:07.490]  but right about now is two years of recording this podcast.
[02:13:07.490 --> 02:13:08.990]  It's our two year anniversary.
[02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:11.190]  So thanks for joining me on the two year ish episode.
[02:13:11.190 --> 02:13:11.890]  That's just fun.
[02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.790]  Here's a good chance.
[02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:14.990]  I was sitting here somewhere around two years ago.
[02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.090]  Yeah,
[02:13:15.090 --> 02:13:17.090]  it's very likely and been hanging out quite a bit.
[02:13:17.090 --> 02:13:20.090]  I bet the folks that have been listening consecutively consistently.
[02:13:20.090 --> 02:13:22.390]  I bet they've learned a shit ton of outdoor stuff from you.
[02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:24.590]  I hope so and they're going to learn a lot more today
[02:13:24.590 --> 02:13:26.390]  and the folks that have never met you are going to learn
[02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:28.190]  a lot about outdoor growing our mess.
[02:13:28.190 --> 02:13:30.490]  Our episode is all about outdoor growing this time you guys.
[02:13:30.490 --> 02:13:31.290]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:13:31.690 --> 02:13:33.890]  I hope you guys are dabbed out because we're dabbed out.
[02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:36.190]  We're smoking some turpex.
[02:13:36.690 --> 02:13:37.990]  I want to I need to give a huge shout out to our
[02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:40.390]  friends at elevate glass in Colorado Springs.

[02:13:43.490 --> 02:13:44.990]  South Tejon in Colorado Springs.
[02:13:44.990 --> 02:13:46.990]  Make sure you check out elevate glass.
[02:13:46.990 --> 02:13:48.390]  That's all the commercials for this one.
[02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:50.590]  So Jess, you haven't been here in a while, bro.
[02:13:50.590 --> 02:13:51.690]  Have you been good?
[02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:52.390]  Very busy.
[02:13:52.490 --> 02:13:52.790]  Good.
[02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:53.590]  Well, that's good for you.
[02:13:54.090 --> 02:13:55.590]  I got some licensing happening.
[02:13:55.590 --> 02:13:56.690]  Got some big things going on.
[02:13:56.690 --> 02:13:57.190]  I'm proud of you.
[02:13:57.190 --> 02:13:57.790]  Good job, man.
[02:13:57.990 --> 02:14:02.590]  We've got our MIP and our in fuck.
[02:14:02.590 --> 02:14:03.490]  I can't remember the initials.
[02:14:03.490 --> 02:14:04.390]  There's so many initials.
[02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:05.190]  Yeah, industry.
[02:14:05.190 --> 02:14:07.390]  We've got our whole set towards your face a little you just got
[02:14:07.390 --> 02:14:12.490]  so grow with no store attached and a hash producing license.
[02:14:12.690 --> 02:14:13.190]  Nice.
[02:14:13.690 --> 02:14:16.790]  BHO hash or like water hash co2 co2.
[02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:17.590]  Very cool.
[02:14:17.590 --> 02:14:18.690]  I don't own the company.
[02:14:18.690 --> 02:14:21.390]  That's not the choice I would have made but but it's still
[02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:22.190]  a good product.
[02:14:22.190 --> 02:14:23.590]  They're not cutting any corners with it.
[02:14:23.590 --> 02:14:26.290]  I can tell you that much and you tried any of the distillate
[02:14:26.290 --> 02:14:27.590]  that's made from co2.
[02:14:27.790 --> 02:14:29.890]  No, I really love that.
[02:14:29.890 --> 02:14:32.190]  I've heard about it and I did not know that was made from
[02:14:32.190 --> 02:14:34.490]  co2 oil this year.
[02:14:34.990 --> 02:14:35.890]  This is spherix.
[02:14:35.890 --> 02:14:36.890]  I'm about to drop it.
[02:14:36.890 --> 02:14:38.890]  I've got two containers stacked up because it's hard to get
[02:14:38.890 --> 02:14:39.690]  that bottom bit out.
[02:14:39.690 --> 02:14:41.490]  So I just turned this website down to put it on there and
[02:14:41.490 --> 02:14:42.290]  it dripped into there.
[02:14:42.290 --> 02:14:43.090]  It did it for me.
[02:14:43.290 --> 02:14:43.790]  Engine.
[02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.890]  That's some spherix.
[02:14:44.890 --> 02:14:47.090]  It's made from co2 oil and then they turn it.
[02:14:47.090 --> 02:14:50.090]  They use they use a fractal distillation process as far as
[02:14:50.090 --> 02:14:50.890]  I understand.
[02:14:50.990 --> 02:14:53.990]  I don't know exactly what that is, but I know that the basics
[02:14:54.190 --> 02:14:56.590]  and they pull out the goodies and that's what it looks like.
[02:14:56.590 --> 02:14:57.590]  We'll take a dab of it here.
[02:14:57.590 --> 02:14:58.190]  We can't do it right now.
[02:14:58.190 --> 02:14:59.290]  It's just too much of a pain in the ass.
[02:14:59.290 --> 02:15:00.090]  We'll do it after the show.
[02:15:00.090 --> 02:15:00.490]  I'll leave it here.
[02:15:00.490 --> 02:15:01.090]  So we see it.
[02:15:01.290 --> 02:15:02.990]  But yeah, that's made from co2 oil.
[02:15:03.090 --> 02:15:04.990]  So you got some serious turps on it.
[02:15:04.990 --> 02:15:06.390]  It's got some serious turps on it.
[02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:08.690]  I'm gonna crack this one open see but so now you're reaching
[02:15:08.690 --> 02:15:09.290]  for the clear.
[02:15:09.290 --> 02:15:10.090]  I like the clear.
[02:15:10.190 --> 02:15:12.790]  Okay, honestly, I like this spherix better.
[02:15:13.090 --> 02:15:13.490]  Okay.
[02:15:13.490 --> 02:15:15.090]  Yeah, that's clear from California.
[02:15:15.390 --> 02:15:16.090]  It's the super lemon.
[02:15:16.090 --> 02:15:16.390]  Haze.
[02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:19.590]  This is spherix og kush and I like the turps on this one.
[02:15:19.590 --> 02:15:20.990]  I prefer the spherix.
[02:15:21.190 --> 02:15:22.490]  I'm sorry to my friends in the clear.
[02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:23.090]  Those are my homies.
[02:15:23.090 --> 02:15:23.890]  They listen to the show.
[02:15:23.890 --> 02:15:25.790]  I'm honest about the things I smoke and review.
[02:15:26.090 --> 02:15:28.990]  Oh man, that uh, it's almost overwhelming, right?
[02:15:28.990 --> 02:15:31.890]  Yeah, it's literally wow.
[02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:33.990]  It's it's almost too turpy.
[02:15:34.190 --> 02:15:34.590]  Wow.
[02:15:34.690 --> 02:15:35.090]  Yeah.
[02:15:35.090 --> 02:15:36.190]  Yeah, I can see that.
[02:15:36.690 --> 02:15:36.990]  You got it.
[02:15:36.990 --> 02:15:38.290]  You got to take little dabs of that one.
[02:15:38.290 --> 02:15:41.590]  I put I'll take a big dab of something else and dip it into
[02:15:41.590 --> 02:15:44.090]  that a little bit so that it's not so overwhelming.
[02:15:44.090 --> 02:15:45.990]  Yeah, this one out the spherix.
[02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:48.690]  I could dab a gram of it by itself and not cough.
[02:15:48.690 --> 02:15:49.790]  My throat doesn't burn.
[02:15:50.090 --> 02:15:50.990]  It's super smooth.
[02:15:50.990 --> 02:15:53.090]  Yeah, so shout out to the guys at spherix.
[02:15:53.090 --> 02:15:54.990]  You just got some free advertising from us.
[02:15:56.090 --> 02:15:57.790]  Hey that happens when you make a good product.
[02:15:57.790 --> 02:15:58.890]  It does when you make a good product.
[02:15:58.890 --> 02:16:00.390]  Rasta Jeff will give you a shout out.
[02:16:01.390 --> 02:16:03.490]  So yeah, let's talk about outdoor growing man.
[02:16:03.490 --> 02:16:04.490]  Everything's going good for you.
[02:16:04.490 --> 02:16:06.190]  You got the new the business running.
[02:16:06.190 --> 02:16:08.190]  Yeah, it's time to grow some outdoor weed.
[02:16:08.790 --> 02:16:11.890]  Hopefully people have access to some clones or some seeds
[02:16:11.890 --> 02:16:13.990]  because now it's time to get those going.
[02:16:14.090 --> 02:16:15.390]  Yeah, especially seeds.
[02:16:15.790 --> 02:16:16.190]  Yeah.
[02:16:16.290 --> 02:16:18.990]  Yeah, you might be a little behind if you're growing from
[02:16:18.990 --> 02:16:19.290]  seeds.
[02:16:19.290 --> 02:16:20.190]  You might be by now.
[02:16:20.190 --> 02:16:20.590]  Yes.
[02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:24.490]  So I guess the first question when should we put our plants
[02:16:24.490 --> 02:16:26.090]  outdoors in Colorado?
[02:16:27.490 --> 02:16:30.690]  Second week of May is kind of real.
[02:16:31.190 --> 02:16:32.790]  That's like the earliest I do it.
[02:16:32.890 --> 02:16:33.390]  All right.
[02:16:33.790 --> 02:16:37.790]  I've put them out, you know, first of June and they still
[02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:40.090]  yielded just as good as the ones that went out the second
[02:16:40.090 --> 02:16:40.590]  week of May.
[02:16:40.890 --> 02:16:42.790]  They get a little extra attention to catch them up.
[02:16:42.890 --> 02:16:44.290]  But yeah, so okay.
[02:16:44.290 --> 02:16:46.690]  So you got about a two-week window that's primed to put
[02:16:46.690 --> 02:16:47.090]  them out.
[02:16:47.090 --> 02:16:49.390]  Yeah, get them out by the first weekend of June though.
[02:16:49.390 --> 02:16:51.090]  If you haven't done it by then carry them out.
[02:16:51.490 --> 02:16:51.890]  Oh, excuse me.
[02:16:51.890 --> 02:16:52.290]  I'm burping.
[02:16:52.290 --> 02:16:53.390]  Carry them out that weekend.
[02:16:53.690 --> 02:16:54.490]  Get them started.
[02:16:54.490 --> 02:16:55.390]  Get them outdoors.
[02:16:56.190 --> 02:16:58.990]  Do you know offhand when we're going to start the flowering
[02:16:58.990 --> 02:16:59.590]  season?
[02:17:00.890 --> 02:17:03.690]  It kind of varies from strain to strain, but typically it's
[02:17:03.690 --> 02:17:06.090]  around the end of July beginning of August.
[02:17:06.090 --> 02:17:06.490]  All right.
[02:17:07.490 --> 02:17:08.390]  That's here in Colorado.
[02:17:08.590 --> 02:17:11.590]  I believe that does change a little regionally.
[02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:11.890]  Right?
[02:17:11.890 --> 02:17:13.090]  That's going to be a little bit different.
[02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:16.090]  The dates when you put stuff outside the time frames are
[02:17:16.090 --> 02:17:18.390]  going to be a little bit different varying from coast
[02:17:18.390 --> 02:17:19.390]  to coast California.
[02:17:19.390 --> 02:17:21.290]  You could put them out today.
[02:17:21.390 --> 02:17:22.790]  There's probably be okay.
[02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:25.190]  I have friends on Instagram that they're already out today
[02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.590]  early.
[02:17:25.790 --> 02:17:26.690]  They've been out for weeks.
[02:17:26.690 --> 02:17:27.190]  Honestly.
[02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.590]  Yeah.
[02:17:27.590 --> 02:17:29.590]  Well, yeah, they're in Oregon and Northern California.
[02:17:29.590 --> 02:17:30.790]  They're spoiled out there though.
[02:17:30.990 --> 02:17:31.590]  Bastards.
[02:17:31.590 --> 02:17:33.990]  Yeah, we can't do it like that.
[02:17:34.090 --> 02:17:34.690]  It's cool.
[02:17:35.290 --> 02:17:36.490]  Yeah, we do crush it though.
[02:17:36.790 --> 02:17:38.190]  We figure out how to fix that.
[02:17:38.290 --> 02:17:41.990]  All right, so get them out there the first week of June at
[02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:43.790]  the latest get them out there.
[02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:44.490]  Get them ready.
[02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:45.690]  Hopefully you've got some clones.
[02:17:45.690 --> 02:17:47.890]  You got some seeds are going you've had them sexed already,
[02:17:47.890 --> 02:17:50.690]  you know, if they're boys or girls, get some plants healthy.
[02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:53.590]  Don't get them too big because they're going to grow really
[02:17:53.590 --> 02:17:55.190]  quickly outdoors last year.
[02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:57.190]  A lot of people weren't prepared for the size of plants that
[02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:59.190]  they were growing and this shit got way too big.
[02:17:59.690 --> 02:18:01.290]  Their camouflage got away from them.
[02:18:01.290 --> 02:18:02.790]  Their fences were way too low.
[02:18:03.090 --> 02:18:03.990]  Yeah, shit went crazy.
[02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:05.890]  That's a good thing, but it's also a bad thing.
[02:18:06.090 --> 02:18:06.990]  So be prepared for that.
[02:18:06.990 --> 02:18:09.190]  Your plants are going to get really large outdoors.
[02:18:09.790 --> 02:18:11.290]  Make sure they're not root bound either.
[02:18:11.890 --> 02:18:13.390]  That's really important.
[02:18:13.490 --> 02:18:14.390]  When you take them outside.
[02:18:14.390 --> 02:18:17.590]  Yeah, when you put them in the ground, I've just I've noticed
[02:18:17.590 --> 02:18:20.590]  through my years of experience root bound plants.
[02:18:20.690 --> 02:18:22.990]  Sometimes they go into shock going outside.
[02:18:24.090 --> 02:18:26.590]  Sometimes they go into shock in a way that they want to start
[02:18:26.590 --> 02:18:28.190]  flowering right away.
[02:18:28.290 --> 02:18:30.490]  Yeah, okay, and that's no good.
[02:18:30.690 --> 02:18:34.390]  Yeah, so make sure they're not root bound and it's you know,
[02:18:34.390 --> 02:18:37.790]  if you have if the weather is holding or like you have a
[02:18:37.790 --> 02:18:41.190]  greenhouse or something you can put out earlier than the second
[02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:45.190]  week of May, but also right now we're around 12 hours of light
[02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:47.790]  here in the first week of April.
[02:18:49.290 --> 02:18:53.490]  So if you put plants outside there is a chance they can go
[02:18:53.490 --> 02:18:56.290]  into bloom and you don't want that to happen.
[02:18:56.290 --> 02:18:57.790]  So they're going to revenge aren't they?
[02:18:57.790 --> 02:18:58.190]  Yeah.
[02:18:58.190 --> 02:18:59.890]  Yeah, we're going to they're going to flower then they're
[02:18:59.890 --> 02:19:01.990]  going to go back and they're going to reflower the horns
[02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:03.090]  are going to be all fucked up.
[02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:07.890]  Yes plants, bad structure and limbs break off and it's just
[02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.590]  no good.
[02:19:08.690 --> 02:19:11.190]  All right, so kind of be don't let them get root bound and
[02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:13.490]  that leads me into my next question perfectly.
[02:19:14.190 --> 02:19:16.690]  I was going to ask you if we should plant into the dirt
[02:19:16.690 --> 02:19:19.490]  outside or if we should take them outside in pots.
[02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:24.790]  I mean my preferred method being kind of a crunchy hippie.
[02:19:25.390 --> 02:19:26.790]  I like to plant straight in the ground.
[02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:29.190]  It's it's less work.
[02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:31.990]  I feel like the plants just are healthier.
[02:19:32.590 --> 02:19:36.190]  But you know doing it in containers is very very possible
[02:19:36.190 --> 02:19:38.090]  to last year.
[02:19:38.090 --> 02:19:41.790]  I did plants in 150 gallons smart pots for the first time
[02:19:42.190 --> 02:19:44.090]  and I was really stoked with those.
[02:19:44.090 --> 02:19:45.390]  How big were your stocks?
[02:19:45.690 --> 02:19:46.490]  Gigantic.
[02:19:46.690 --> 02:19:47.590]  Size of your arms.
[02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:50.790]  The the first and second round of plants that got put in
[02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:53.490]  there got stolen by some fucking asshole.
[02:19:53.490 --> 02:19:55.190]  Fuck thieves and plant rippers.
[02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:57.990]  I haven't talked much about it, but I had a horrible summer
[02:19:57.990 --> 02:19:58.290]  this year.
[02:19:58.290 --> 02:20:00.190]  I never mentioned it on the show, but we talked about some
[02:20:00.190 --> 02:20:01.190]  people getting ripped off.
[02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.890]  You were one of those.
[02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:04.390]  Fuck whoever took Jesse's plants.
[02:20:04.390 --> 02:20:07.890]  So they didn't get as big as they is, you know, if the first
[02:20:07.890 --> 02:20:09.490]  ones I put out there would have got left there.
[02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:12.890]  The stocks probably would have been as big around as a
[02:20:12.890 --> 02:20:13.790]  two-liter bottle.
[02:20:13.890 --> 02:20:14.390]  Damn.
[02:20:14.590 --> 02:20:16.990]  They ended up about as big around as one of these.
[02:20:17.490 --> 02:20:18.590]  Arrowhead water bottles.
[02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:20.790]  Or 20 ounce of water bottles.
[02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:21.290]  Okay.
[02:20:21.290 --> 02:20:21.790]  Wow.
[02:20:22.290 --> 02:20:25.790]  And that was with about four and a half weeks of bed.
[02:20:26.490 --> 02:20:27.690]  They were going to be beasts.
[02:20:27.690 --> 02:20:28.090]  Yeah.
[02:20:28.290 --> 02:20:32.790]  The first ones that got taken, they were my string government
[02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:36.690]  mule and is you want to tell us about government mule?
[02:20:36.690 --> 02:20:37.890]  I'll give you an opportunity to do that.
[02:20:37.890 --> 02:20:38.190]  Sure.
[02:20:38.190 --> 02:20:45.690]  It's made by Shemira, I think, which is a company that's
[02:20:45.690 --> 02:20:47.290]  not really in existence anymore.
[02:20:47.390 --> 02:20:48.490]  He's still around though.
[02:20:48.490 --> 02:20:48.790]  Yeah.
[02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:49.190]  Yeah.
[02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:52.490]  He just doesn't make seeds anymore, but it's a deep junk
[02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:56.190]  Tom Hills deep junk crossed with G13.
[02:20:56.290 --> 02:20:56.790]  Okay.
[02:20:57.490 --> 02:20:59.290]  So you were growing the shit out of that?
[02:20:59.290 --> 02:21:02.190]  Yeah, the Fino I have is like periodica.
[02:21:02.690 --> 02:21:06.390]  It's real short and stocky and this plant that was in the
[02:21:06.390 --> 02:21:11.390]  150 gallon smart pot last year within maybe six weeks of
[02:21:11.390 --> 02:21:13.790]  being outside or no, it didn't make it that long.
[02:21:14.390 --> 02:21:16.490]  Probably about four weeks with being outside.
[02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:20.390]  It was seriously eight foot tall six foot around six foot,
[02:21:20.390 --> 02:21:25.090]  you know, it was just beast and that's not a strain that
[02:21:25.090 --> 02:21:26.190]  really beasts like that.
[02:21:26.290 --> 02:21:29.390]  So if it was a smart pot was making it happy.
[02:21:29.390 --> 02:21:29.790]  Oh, yeah.
[02:21:29.790 --> 02:21:30.090]  Yeah.
[02:21:30.190 --> 02:21:30.490]  All right.
[02:21:30.490 --> 02:21:31.790]  So that's that leads me perfectly.
[02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:32.690]  You keep helping me out.
[02:21:32.690 --> 02:21:35.390]  You're segwaying into my next questions on accident here.
[02:21:36.690 --> 02:21:39.790]  If we're going to put our plants into the ground, do we just
[02:21:39.790 --> 02:21:41.590]  want to throw them into the dirt that's in the backyard or
[02:21:41.590 --> 02:21:43.790]  do we want to dig a hole and put some good dirt in there?
[02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:46.190]  Some good soil that we buy from the store or we just want
[02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:47.290]  to use the backyard soil.
[02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:51.090]  I mean, if that's all you have you can use it.
[02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:55.490]  Okay, I wouldn't know right, especially here in Southern
[02:21:55.490 --> 02:21:56.890]  Colorado native soil.
[02:21:57.490 --> 02:21:57.990]  It's pretty hard.
[02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:59.990]  It's pretty dusty and kind of clay like yeah.
[02:22:00.090 --> 02:22:02.290]  Yeah, it's been killed off pretty good, especially like in
[02:22:02.290 --> 02:22:03.890]  residential areas and stuff.
[02:22:03.890 --> 02:22:06.690]  So yeah, it doesn't hold water.
[02:22:06.690 --> 02:22:11.990]  Well, when it's dusty like that the nutrients that are in it
[02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:13.790]  that could because it's shell based soil.
[02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:16.290]  There's a shit ton of nutrients in it, but it's not accept
[02:22:16.290 --> 02:22:19.290]  as accessible to the plant because of the structure of the
[02:22:19.290 --> 02:22:19.690]  soil.
[02:22:19.690 --> 02:22:23.390]  So you're growing you basically end up growing in a pretty
[02:22:23.890 --> 02:22:25.190]  super salty environment.
[02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:26.390]  Yeah, yeah, literally.
[02:22:27.090 --> 02:22:31.890]  So at the very minimum to have, you know, pretty good results.
[02:22:31.890 --> 02:22:35.690]  I'd recommend cutting your native soil with like one part
[02:22:35.690 --> 02:22:41.390]  coco coir or one part peat moss and then one part native soil
[02:22:41.690 --> 02:22:45.090]  and then one part worm castings or compost.
[02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:50.390]  Okay, so and by default that that soil recipe pretty much
[02:22:50.390 --> 02:22:53.390]  works everywhere and you'll end up with some really great
[02:22:53.390 --> 02:22:53.790]  soil.
[02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:55.890]  So I hope you guys wrote that down.
[02:22:56.290 --> 02:22:57.590]  You know, that'd be your base.
[02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:59.890]  So then you can still add extra amendments to that.
[02:22:59.890 --> 02:23:02.590]  Also, if you if you wish you can afford it and if you want
[02:23:02.590 --> 02:23:05.490]  to yeah, but okay, that's like farmer recipe.
[02:23:05.490 --> 02:23:09.390]  That's produce gets grown on that recipe like in the raised
[02:23:09.690 --> 02:23:10.690]  permaculture beds.
[02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:12.190]  Okay, that's that's it.
[02:23:12.190 --> 02:23:13.090]  So, all right.
[02:23:13.290 --> 02:23:17.190]  So can we throw that same recipe into those hundred and fifty
[02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:18.090]  gallons SmartPots?
[02:23:18.090 --> 02:23:18.490]  That's it.
[02:23:18.490 --> 02:23:19.890]  That's actually exactly what I did.
[02:23:19.890 --> 02:23:23.690]  I added a little more aeration to it and maybe went a little
[02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:25.190]  bit heavier on the peat moss.
[02:23:25.390 --> 02:23:25.790]  Okay.
[02:23:25.890 --> 02:23:27.590]  Yeah, that's exactly what I did.
[02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:29.890]  So yeah, and it worked out great.
[02:23:29.890 --> 02:23:32.390]  Stocks the size of football of two liter gallons.
[02:23:32.490 --> 02:23:33.090]  That's huge bro.
[02:23:33.090 --> 02:23:33.790]  That is huge.
[02:23:34.290 --> 02:23:34.790]  Good job.
[02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:35.990]  I wish you had pictures to show me.
[02:23:37.090 --> 02:23:37.590]  Me too.
[02:23:39.390 --> 02:23:42.190]  All right, so I'm going to throw out a little bit of a soil
[02:23:42.190 --> 02:23:43.090]  mix that I wrote down.
[02:23:43.090 --> 02:23:44.990]  I would buy if I were going to use hundred and fifty gallon
[02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:46.090]  SmartPots outside.
[02:23:46.190 --> 02:23:47.090]  That's got to be a huge pot.
[02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:48.390]  How is that about six feet around?
[02:23:48.390 --> 02:23:48.890]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:23:49.290 --> 02:23:49.990]  Three feet tall.
[02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.990]  It's like a kid pool.
[02:23:51.290 --> 02:23:52.190]  It's about that tall.
[02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:52.490]  Yeah.
[02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:52.790]  Yeah.
[02:23:52.890 --> 02:23:54.790]  Okay, but 24 28 inches ish.
[02:23:54.990 --> 02:23:55.390]  Yes.
[02:23:55.390 --> 02:23:55.690]  Yes.
[02:23:55.690 --> 02:23:56.090]  Yeah.
[02:23:56.090 --> 02:23:58.590]  So yeah, that's that's a fucking kid pool.
[02:23:58.590 --> 02:24:01.290]  Yeah, fill it up with jello and people wrestling there.
[02:24:02.090 --> 02:24:05.090]  So I would put I would buy some bagged soilless mix.
[02:24:06.090 --> 02:24:07.190]  I'm not too picky about that.
[02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:08.090]  Whatever the store has.
[02:24:08.090 --> 02:24:09.190]  I like the roots organic.
[02:24:09.190 --> 02:24:12.090]  I like to per it's pretty much all the same shit.
[02:24:12.090 --> 02:24:12.890]  It's a little bit different.
[02:24:12.890 --> 02:24:14.290]  It's all the same and then the same right?
[02:24:14.290 --> 02:24:15.890]  Yeah, you run a hydro store, you know what I'm talking about?
[02:24:15.890 --> 02:24:18.390]  It's all the same different shit roots has more aeration in
[02:24:18.390 --> 02:24:19.890]  it. Like your Fox foreign products.
[02:24:20.290 --> 02:24:22.590]  I always feel like they need a little per lighter.
[02:24:22.690 --> 02:24:24.790]  Something added right and they need to be sifted because
[02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:26.790]  they're sticks and shit and Fox farms all the time.
[02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:27.790]  What the hell are they doing?
[02:24:28.690 --> 02:24:29.690]  So I'd go some bag soil.
[02:24:29.690 --> 02:24:30.690]  It doesn't matter what you use.
[02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:33.090]  I would definitely put worm castings in there.
[02:24:33.090 --> 02:24:35.290]  I like the cocoa core like Jesse said, I think it gives
[02:24:35.290 --> 02:24:37.890]  the plants a little bit of its adds moisture to the plant's
[02:24:37.890 --> 02:24:39.990]  life. Their vascular systems a little more healthy.
[02:24:40.490 --> 02:24:42.590]  They just seem more hydrated with the cocoa in there.
[02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:46.390]  I think they get more flavor cocoa most definitely it well
[02:24:46.690 --> 02:24:49.090]  it holds water differently than peat moss does right?
[02:24:49.090 --> 02:24:51.390]  So you're like doubling down right there and you can use
[02:24:51.390 --> 02:24:52.190]  a little more nutrient.
[02:24:52.190 --> 02:24:53.690]  You need a little more nutrient with that.
[02:24:53.690 --> 02:24:54.690]  Yeah, that's always fun.
[02:24:54.890 --> 02:24:56.190]  I like to put perlite in there.
[02:24:56.390 --> 02:24:59.190]  Yeah, just to keep it airy and fluffy and it helps you not
[02:24:59.190 --> 02:25:01.790]  over water especially in outdoor situations.
[02:25:01.790 --> 02:25:03.990]  You might get a rainy ass night that perlite is save your
[02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:06.590]  life for sure the peat moss like you're tired of the peat
[02:25:06.590 --> 02:25:09.290]  like you're saying and then for pest prevention.
[02:25:09.290 --> 02:25:11.790]  I we learned this from our good friend Sean shout out to
[02:25:11.790 --> 02:25:12.290]  King Cola.
[02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:14.990]  If you're listening, I like to mix in the Karanja meal and
[02:25:14.990 --> 02:25:15.490]  neem cakes.
[02:25:15.490 --> 02:25:18.090]  If we're going outdoors just to keep those bugs away.
[02:25:18.290 --> 02:25:20.390]  Yeah, that's that's part of my personal.
[02:25:20.490 --> 02:25:23.390]  I mean, yeah, you came real close to my personal recipe.
[02:25:23.390 --> 02:25:24.790]  Would you put some oyster shell in there?
[02:25:25.290 --> 02:25:25.790]  Yes, very.
[02:25:25.790 --> 02:25:26.690]  See, all right.
[02:25:26.690 --> 02:25:28.090]  I'm learning the outdoor from you guys.
[02:25:28.090 --> 02:25:30.090]  I don't do it myself, but that's why I bring you guys.
[02:25:30.090 --> 02:25:34.590]  Here's a trick on the oyster shell add go to hydro store
[02:25:34.590 --> 02:25:35.490]  guy giving away.
[02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:39.290]  Okay, go to the feed store and get oyster shell for chickens.
[02:25:40.890 --> 02:25:42.390]  It's been collected off the beach.
[02:25:42.390 --> 02:25:43.790]  It's not ground up.
[02:25:43.990 --> 02:25:46.090]  It's whole oyster shell breaks down.
[02:25:46.190 --> 02:25:48.190]  It takes it more time to break down.
[02:25:48.690 --> 02:25:51.290]  So put that in as a bit of a time release and then get the
[02:25:51.290 --> 02:25:55.190]  powder powder iced oyster shell from your local hydro store
[02:25:55.590 --> 02:25:58.990]  and you got two different two different available times.
[02:25:58.990 --> 02:25:59.690]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[02:25:59.690 --> 02:26:00.190]  Good tips.
[02:26:00.190 --> 02:26:01.590]  You get all the way through the season.
[02:26:01.690 --> 02:26:02.090]  I like that.
[02:26:02.090 --> 02:26:04.890]  You're a hydro store guy that doesn't just make a shop at
[02:26:04.890 --> 02:26:05.490]  the hydro store.
[02:26:05.490 --> 02:26:07.090]  You recommend feed store stuff.
[02:26:07.090 --> 02:26:08.890]  Yeah, I have to pay for the shit too, man.
[02:26:08.890 --> 02:26:13.690]  I mean, right one thing I want to mention you can use bottled
[02:26:13.690 --> 02:26:14.990]  nutrients in your outdoor grow.
[02:26:14.990 --> 02:26:16.790]  If you're just going to throw the plants into some soil
[02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:19.290]  containers or dig a hole in your backyard, you can go to
[02:26:19.290 --> 02:26:19.790]  the store.
[02:26:19.790 --> 02:26:20.990]  You can buy some botanic care.
[02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:22.390]  You can buy some nectar of the gods.
[02:26:22.390 --> 02:26:24.790]  You can buy whatever brand they've got their a and B their
[02:26:24.790 --> 02:26:26.190]  bloom feed solution.
[02:26:26.490 --> 02:26:27.390]  They're bloom boosters.
[02:26:27.390 --> 02:26:29.990]  You can mix that up for throwing it into some outdoor soil.
[02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:31.690]  You can actually mix it up kind of heavy.
[02:26:32.290 --> 02:26:34.790]  You can feed it pretty damn strong with that stuff outdoors.
[02:26:35.290 --> 02:26:36.190]  You can do that.
[02:26:36.190 --> 02:26:39.190]  If you're not able to maybe somebody's not able-bodied.
[02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:40.090]  We're pretty healthy dudes.
[02:26:40.090 --> 02:26:40.690]  We can do things.
[02:26:40.690 --> 02:26:42.890]  Maybe somebody doesn't have the physical capabilities.
[02:26:43.090 --> 02:26:45.590]  They can throw a few pots in the backyard and mix up some
[02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:47.390]  nutrients and have somebody help them do that way instead
[02:26:47.390 --> 02:26:49.590]  of having to mix up a big batch of dirt and plant these.
[02:26:49.690 --> 02:26:50.890]  You can do that you guys.
[02:26:50.990 --> 02:26:51.490]  For sure.
[02:26:51.790 --> 02:26:55.690]  We would just as a ganja farmer myself and indoor ganja farmer
[02:26:55.690 --> 02:26:57.090]  and Jesse and outdoor farm boy.
[02:26:57.390 --> 02:27:00.190]  I think we'd rather lead people into this way of mixing up some
[02:27:00.190 --> 02:27:02.790]  soil outdoors and letting nature kind of do its thing.
[02:27:02.890 --> 02:27:04.590]  It takes a lot of the guesswork out of it.
[02:27:05.490 --> 02:27:10.290]  This will promote pest prevention and a healthy environment.
[02:27:10.590 --> 02:27:13.790]  Using those bottle nutrients isn't going to contribute to
[02:27:14.790 --> 02:27:15.390]  plant health.
[02:27:15.390 --> 02:27:17.390]  It's only going to contribute to big buds.
[02:27:17.490 --> 02:27:19.690]  Yeah, and the soil recipes we're talking about here.
[02:27:19.690 --> 02:27:22.990]  They actually help with the healing of the earth.
[02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:24.790]  They contribute back to that.
[02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:26.190]  They make the soil better.
[02:27:26.590 --> 02:27:29.390]  So when you leave there that that piece of ground is better than
[02:27:29.390 --> 02:27:30.290]  it was before.
[02:27:31.390 --> 02:27:35.390]  And that's one, you know, you I suppose you can do that with
[02:27:35.390 --> 02:27:38.490]  bottle nutrients to just watch out for salt buildups and stuff
[02:27:38.490 --> 02:27:38.990]  like that.
[02:27:38.990 --> 02:27:39.890]  So right.
[02:27:40.290 --> 02:27:43.990]  It's not as friendly and if you do grow outside do it on your
[02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.490]  land.
[02:27:44.490 --> 02:27:47.590]  Don't do it in some National Forest.
[02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:51.290]  Don't be an idiot like that and clean your shit up like take
[02:27:51.290 --> 02:27:52.090]  your bottles inside.
[02:27:52.090 --> 02:27:54.690]  Don't make don't yeah, like Jesse said, make it better than
[02:27:54.690 --> 02:27:55.390]  when you found it.
[02:27:55.390 --> 02:27:57.290]  Just like when you go camping make it cleaner than when you
[02:27:57.290 --> 02:27:59.390]  found it pick up some trash shout out for pieces.
[02:27:59.590 --> 02:28:02.890]  I think I have told the story on some of the older episodes
[02:28:02.890 --> 02:28:07.090]  or the earlier ones but a few years ago, there was a gigantic
[02:28:07.090 --> 02:28:12.190]  cartel bust here in the mountains real near here and I have
[02:28:12.290 --> 02:28:15.090]  family land that neighbors the land where they got busted on.
[02:28:15.990 --> 02:28:19.990]  So we hiked in, you know after the cops, you know, just to
[02:28:19.990 --> 02:28:22.790]  check it out and look around and the amount of trash up there
[02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:25.090]  was just appalling terrible.
[02:28:25.390 --> 02:28:29.990]  I grew up on that mountain and you know, it's kind of almost
[02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:33.790]  brings a tear to your eye to see that see that up there and
[02:28:33.790 --> 02:28:35.990]  is it accessible to folks like us?
[02:28:36.290 --> 02:28:36.690]  No.
[02:28:36.690 --> 02:28:37.890]  No, you'd be trespassing.
[02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:40.690]  I have problems with from the excuse me from coffin.
[02:28:40.690 --> 02:28:41.590]  What if we went to clean it?
[02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:43.090]  That's not really trespassing is it?
[02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:47.090]  I don't think anyone I don't think Bob would say anything.
[02:28:47.090 --> 02:28:51.190]  So that is I was going to say that what was that four years
[02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.990]  ago that happened.
[02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:54.390]  We're still hauling trash out of there.
[02:28:54.490 --> 02:28:59.190]  This we make it is a pretty good hike from the road or from
[02:28:59.190 --> 02:29:03.090]  where my cabin is but we make a few trips up there year and
[02:29:03.090 --> 02:29:04.090]  haul some trash out.
[02:29:04.090 --> 02:29:04.590]  Cool.
[02:29:04.690 --> 02:29:07.990]  That's yeah, it's ridiculous how much was up there.
[02:29:08.190 --> 02:29:13.590]  So it's just also it's ridiculous how much the cops in the
[02:29:13.590 --> 02:29:16.490]  DEA left up there because you can tell the trash from the
[02:29:16.490 --> 02:29:19.490]  cartel growers and you can tell the trash from the cops and
[02:29:19.490 --> 02:29:20.790]  they just left shit up there.
[02:29:20.890 --> 02:29:23.590]  The Dunkin Donuts was from the cops and the beans and rice
[02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:24.490]  was from the cartel.
[02:29:24.490 --> 02:29:24.790]  Yep.
[02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:26.290]  That's real.
[02:29:26.290 --> 02:29:27.090]  They don't know straight.
[02:29:27.090 --> 02:29:30.690]  I had free you told me in my one of my friends dads was a
[02:29:30.690 --> 02:29:31.490]  police officer.
[02:29:31.490 --> 02:29:32.990]  I don't know how much I'm supposed to talk about that.
[02:29:32.990 --> 02:29:33.790]  He's not a cop anymore.
[02:29:33.790 --> 02:29:36.590]  So they can't probably do shit but he was retiring at the
[02:29:36.590 --> 02:29:39.990]  time and they called him and had him go stand there and watch
[02:29:39.990 --> 02:29:42.790]  like once they rated everybody ran but they needed the teams
[02:29:42.790 --> 02:29:44.890]  to get up there like the DEA and shit wanted to go and
[02:29:44.890 --> 02:29:45.890]  investigate.
[02:29:45.890 --> 02:29:49.090]  So he stood there and watched just made sure that nobody went
[02:29:49.090 --> 02:29:51.790]  in that area, but he said that he walked around and they had
[02:29:51.790 --> 02:29:54.590]  little camps set up like stoves with beans and rice and all
[02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:56.490]  the all the food was from Mexico.
[02:29:56.490 --> 02:29:58.990]  It was all Mexican packaging and you're straight up making
[02:29:58.990 --> 02:30:00.390]  Mexican dinner up there every night.
[02:30:00.690 --> 02:30:03.890]  Even the miracle can grow containers that I have cleaned
[02:30:03.890 --> 02:30:04.690]  up off there.
[02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:06.790]  They have Mexican writing on them.
[02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:08.190]  There's no English on them whatsoever.
[02:30:08.190 --> 02:30:11.990]  You're like segueing into the things that I have in my mind
[02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:14.390]  for the show on accident, which is fucking awesome.
[02:30:15.490 --> 02:30:17.690]  Would you add anything to this oil mix before we move on?
[02:30:17.690 --> 02:30:19.590]  Would you do you use as a mite azo?
[02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:20.090]  My yeah.
[02:30:20.090 --> 02:30:20.290]  Yeah.
[02:30:20.290 --> 02:30:22.390]  So I'm gonna write that down for next year's lessons.
[02:30:22.390 --> 02:30:23.790]  I like doing minerals.
[02:30:23.790 --> 02:30:25.290]  So I do the salt.
[02:30:25.390 --> 02:30:29.790]  This is real similar to the clackamas cute recipe from the
[02:30:29.790 --> 02:30:32.890]  forums and build a soil but the sun old school bro.
[02:30:32.890 --> 02:30:34.190]  I haven't heard that name in a long time.
[02:30:34.190 --> 02:30:34.590]  Really?
[02:30:35.090 --> 02:30:35.590]  Nice.
[02:30:37.690 --> 02:30:39.290]  Basalt gypsum.
[02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:41.790]  And these are all things you can find at your local garden
[02:30:41.790 --> 02:30:44.490]  stores, especially like gypsum dolomite lime.
[02:30:45.390 --> 02:30:47.190]  Those are all pretty easy to find.
[02:30:47.890 --> 02:30:51.290]  Then I use as a mite those four combinations of minerals.
[02:30:51.290 --> 02:30:53.990]  You got pretty much every single trace mineral in the world
[02:30:53.990 --> 02:30:54.790]  covered right there.
[02:30:54.890 --> 02:30:56.290]  That's going to make your plants turpy.
[02:30:56.290 --> 02:30:57.290]  It's going to make them healthy.
[02:30:57.490 --> 02:31:02.390]  You're going to smell real well and then oyster shell shrimp
[02:31:02.390 --> 02:31:05.490]  mill fish mill some something like that some kind of I like
[02:31:05.490 --> 02:31:06.290]  aqua products.
[02:31:06.290 --> 02:31:08.790]  I stay away from bone mill and blood mill like slaughterhouse
[02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:09.190]  products.
[02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:11.090]  I would use kelp meal if that were up to me.
[02:31:11.090 --> 02:31:13.590]  So I'm gonna write down kelp mill for my style just my sure
[02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:14.290]  what I prefer.
[02:31:14.390 --> 02:31:16.090]  I used to yeah tons of coat mill.
[02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:22.490]  Alfalfa mill all good for a neem and nitrogen.
[02:31:22.490 --> 02:31:24.990]  Yeah, and alfalfa breaks down really quick.
[02:31:24.990 --> 02:31:29.490]  So that can give you some of that real early season, you
[02:31:29.490 --> 02:31:33.990]  know boost to get them exploded to you know, pot bottle sized
[02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:36.890]  stocks and for weeks your plants are going to take up 90% of
[02:31:36.890 --> 02:31:39.690]  their nitrogen during the vegetative phase of their lives.
[02:31:39.690 --> 02:31:39.990]  Yep.
[02:31:40.190 --> 02:31:43.790]  Yeah, and you actually you don't want to over spike that that's
[02:31:43.790 --> 02:31:47.490]  why alfalfa mills good because it breaks down so quick you in
[02:31:47.490 --> 02:31:49.290]  the middle of flowering towards the end of flowering.
[02:31:49.290 --> 02:31:52.190]  You don't want them to find a source of nitrogen that can have
[02:31:52.190 --> 02:31:52.790]  some shit up.
[02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:55.190]  Yeah, make them taste smoky and it'll slow down the flowering
[02:31:55.190 --> 02:31:56.790]  phase rest the buds out a little.
[02:31:56.790 --> 02:31:57.990]  Yeah, they'll start to finger.
[02:31:58.190 --> 02:32:00.090]  Yeah, little fingers foxtails.
[02:32:00.890 --> 02:32:01.190]  All right.
[02:32:01.190 --> 02:32:04.890]  So you said a minute ago you cleaned up a bunch of fucking Miracle
[02:32:04.890 --> 02:32:07.990]  Grow containers from that cartel grow site you guys if you want
[02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:09.290]  to Google the cartel grow site.
[02:32:09.290 --> 02:32:10.090]  I'm sure you could find it.
[02:32:10.090 --> 02:32:12.590]  It was the cartel grow found in the San Isabel National Forest
[02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:17.290]  area Highway 165 is about probably four or five years ago.
[02:32:17.690 --> 02:32:19.990]  I was well well covered by the news around here.
[02:32:20.490 --> 02:32:22.890]  So they threw out a bunch of Miracle Grow containers, which
[02:32:22.890 --> 02:32:25.390]  tells me that they probably weren't growing super quality product.
[02:32:25.390 --> 02:32:25.990]  No, no.
[02:32:26.390 --> 02:32:29.290]  Let's talk for a minute about why we should never use Miracle
[02:32:29.290 --> 02:32:32.090]  Grow or any Scots type of product.
[02:32:32.090 --> 02:32:35.790]  First of all Miracle Grow is made by Scots which is owned by
[02:32:35.790 --> 02:32:41.190]  Monsanto, which is trying to force the entire world to be force-fed
[02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:45.190]  seeds that are made by them which are all GMO produced to be able
[02:32:45.190 --> 02:32:48.390]  to be sprayed by their products that are made by them.
[02:32:48.690 --> 02:32:51.790]  They're ruining a whole bunch of things and not healthy.
[02:32:51.790 --> 02:32:54.790]  I'm just fucking talking in a circle right now, but killing the
[02:32:54.790 --> 02:32:55.190]  bees.
[02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:56.690]  They're real.
[02:32:56.690 --> 02:32:57.690]  It's all about money for those guys.
[02:32:57.690 --> 02:33:00.490]  Science is showing they're pretty much single-handedly responsible
[02:33:00.490 --> 02:33:02.390]  for the bee die off right now.
[02:33:02.690 --> 02:33:05.990]  So we do not want to support anything with Monsanto in the first
[02:33:05.990 --> 02:33:06.290]  place.
[02:33:06.290 --> 02:33:09.490]  That's why we don't want to use any type of Miracle Grow or Scots
[02:33:09.490 --> 02:33:10.090]  products.
[02:33:10.090 --> 02:33:14.690]  Yeah, if you're going to buy stuff like that, go to a hydroponic
[02:33:14.690 --> 02:33:18.490]  store, go to your local grow store, get a decent grow soil.
[02:33:18.490 --> 02:33:21.790]  Don't go get like a turf builder at Home Depot or at Lowe's.
[02:33:21.890 --> 02:33:25.090]  A lot of people hate on the Fox Farm brand.
[02:33:25.090 --> 02:33:28.090]  I think that's actually available at some of the larger hardware
[02:33:28.090 --> 02:33:30.490]  stores like Ace may have Fox Farm.
[02:33:30.490 --> 02:33:33.290]  Fox Farm isn't amazing, but it's definitely not bad.
[02:33:33.290 --> 02:33:36.590]  Yeah, if you're going to buy something at Ace or Home Depot or
[02:33:36.590 --> 02:33:37.990]  Lowe's, get Fox Farm.
[02:33:37.990 --> 02:33:39.490]  Don't get the Scots brand stuff.
[02:33:39.590 --> 02:33:42.290]  Yeah, Pro-Mix is available at most of those places too.
[02:33:42.290 --> 02:33:43.490]  Pro-Mix is a good product.
[02:33:43.690 --> 02:33:44.990]  Sunshine 4 Pro-Mix?
[02:33:45.090 --> 02:33:47.590]  Yeah, the Sunshine... Different companies.
[02:33:47.690 --> 02:33:49.890]  Okay, but they look very similar.
[02:33:50.090 --> 02:33:51.890]  It's pretty much the exact same thing.
[02:33:51.890 --> 02:33:52.390]  Okay.
[02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:57.290]  Different proprietary blends of Mycorrhiza and Inoculation.
[02:33:57.290 --> 02:33:58.390]  So Pro-Mix is good shit.
[02:33:58.390 --> 02:33:59.690]  You can buy that in bulk.
[02:34:00.090 --> 02:34:00.890]  Yeah, they sell that in.
[02:34:00.890 --> 02:34:03.290]  So if you're doing some outdoor Pro-Mix, yeah, go get that.
[02:34:03.290 --> 02:34:04.290]  That's not bad at all.
[02:34:04.490 --> 02:34:05.690]  Mix in these amendments.
[02:34:05.690 --> 02:34:05.990]  Yep.
[02:34:05.990 --> 02:34:07.590]  You'll be fucking golden out there.
[02:34:07.890 --> 02:34:09.790]  But let's talk about why not to use it.
[02:34:10.490 --> 02:34:13.390]  First of all, the obvious reasons that they're Monsanto products,
[02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:17.490]  but they're way overloaded with the wrong NPK ratios.
[02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:19.090]  Well, ton of nitrogen.
[02:34:19.090 --> 02:34:20.990]  Tons of nitrogen, way too much.
[02:34:21.290 --> 02:34:23.590]  And that soil is loaded with these little...
[02:34:23.590 --> 02:34:26.290]  They used to be green when I was a kid, these little green speckles.
[02:34:26.290 --> 02:34:26.690]  Yeah.
[02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:30.890]  And those are time-release nitrogen and basically,
[02:34:30.890 --> 02:34:32.790]  they're little time-release vitamins for the plant.
[02:34:33.090 --> 02:34:36.590]  So what sucks about that is you don't have very good control
[02:34:36.590 --> 02:34:37.790]  of what you're feeding your plant.
[02:34:37.790 --> 02:34:40.090]  However often you water, those are going to dissolve
[02:34:40.090 --> 02:34:41.690]  and your plant's going to get that nutrient.
[02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:45.390]  You don't want nutrients going to your plant every single time you water.
[02:34:45.490 --> 02:34:46.290]  No, no, no.
[02:34:46.390 --> 02:34:47.790]  You're going to start getting salt buildup.
[02:34:47.790 --> 02:34:48.990]  You're going to start getting crinkled leaves.
[02:34:48.990 --> 02:34:49.990]  You're going to see burnt tips.
[02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:51.390]  Your buds aren't going to taste funny.
[02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:53.190]  So don't use that type of stuff.
[02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:55.090]  Don't use any of that Miracle-Gro feeding.
[02:34:55.490 --> 02:34:56.790]  Go to a real growth store.
[02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:58.490]  I recommend Botanicare.
[02:34:58.990 --> 02:34:59.890]  Nectar of the Gods.
[02:34:59.890 --> 02:35:02.590]  I've seen great results from Nectar of the Gods recently.
[02:35:02.590 --> 02:35:03.990]  Shout out to my buddy, Steve Dufino.
[02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:05.390]  I don't know if you listen to the podcast, bro,
[02:35:05.390 --> 02:35:09.390]  but you grow with Nectar of the Gods and the stuff you grow tastes really good.
[02:35:09.390 --> 02:35:11.190]  So Nectar of the Gods is good.
[02:35:11.190 --> 02:35:12.290]  Botanicare is good.
[02:35:13.290 --> 02:35:16.890]  I've used advanced nutrients and I had okay results,
[02:35:16.890 --> 02:35:20.190]  but I was more happy with Botanicare by a long shot.
[02:35:20.590 --> 02:35:22.290]  I did not like Psycho at all.
[02:35:22.590 --> 02:35:24.090]  The Psycho brand, I do not approve.
[02:35:24.090 --> 02:35:25.090]  I did not like it.
[02:35:25.590 --> 02:35:27.090]  There are a lot of brands available at the store.
[02:35:27.090 --> 02:35:28.090]  What's super hot right now?
[02:35:28.090 --> 02:35:30.190]  I haven't been paying too much attention to the new stuff.
[02:35:30.290 --> 02:35:31.590]  Nectar, we push.
[02:35:33.490 --> 02:35:34.590]  Nectar's coming up.
[02:35:34.590 --> 02:35:36.990]  It takes a while to get people switched over to Align,
[02:35:38.090 --> 02:35:40.890]  you know, from my perspective, or from the retail setting.
[02:35:40.990 --> 02:35:41.390]  Oh, yeah.
[02:35:41.790 --> 02:35:44.590]  But Botanicare and General Hydroponics are our biggest sellers.
[02:35:44.590 --> 02:35:46.090]  GH is definitely reliable.
[02:35:46.190 --> 02:35:48.190]  General Hydroponics, General Organics.
[02:35:48.690 --> 02:35:50.090]  And then Mills.
[02:35:50.090 --> 02:35:51.490]  Mills pays the bills.
[02:35:51.490 --> 02:35:53.090]  I've seen some good shit with Mills.
[02:35:53.090 --> 02:35:56.590]  I learned some last week, some things about Mills that
[02:35:57.290 --> 02:35:59.790]  even this organic grower is going to give him a shot.
[02:35:59.790 --> 02:36:01.590]  So, I'm like, I'm some indoors stuff.
[02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:02.990]  Spence was killing it with the Mills.
[02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.890]  He was crushing it.
[02:36:03.890 --> 02:36:05.490]  So shout out to Spence with the Mills.
[02:36:05.790 --> 02:36:06.790]  He's doing a good job.
[02:36:07.490 --> 02:36:11.790]  Yeah, BioBiz is always decent stuff, especially for like outdoor.
[02:36:11.890 --> 02:36:13.990]  Canna is a great line if you want to spend some money.
[02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:14.990]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:36:15.090 --> 02:36:17.190]  They're Dutch and they're well made.
[02:36:17.790 --> 02:36:19.890]  Jungle Juice is really good.
[02:36:20.090 --> 02:36:20.790]  Earth Juice.
[02:36:20.890 --> 02:36:21.390]  Earth Juice.
[02:36:21.390 --> 02:36:22.090]  Yeah, that's what I meant.
[02:36:22.090 --> 02:36:22.590]  Yeah, sorry.
[02:36:22.690 --> 02:36:23.490]  I can see the labels.
[02:36:23.490 --> 02:36:25.390]  I just haven't seen them in so long.
[02:36:25.390 --> 02:36:26.090]  I do the same thing.
[02:36:26.190 --> 02:36:28.190]  I really recommend, if you're going to use bottled nutrients,
[02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:30.090]  I like to add Humble Honey.
[02:36:30.590 --> 02:36:31.190]  That's a good one.
[02:36:31.190 --> 02:36:32.090]  That's a good product.
[02:36:32.090 --> 02:36:33.890]  Yeah, it's definitely, yeah, it's got good stuff in there.
[02:36:33.890 --> 02:36:37.190]  So, go to the Hydro store, get yourself bottled nutrients.
[02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:41.490]  If you're confused, don't buy that stuff at the hardware store.
[02:36:41.490 --> 02:36:44.290]  Don't buy, try not to buy your soil and stuff at the hardware store.
[02:36:44.290 --> 02:36:45.490]  They're a grow store somewhere.
[02:36:45.690 --> 02:36:49.090]  If you live somewhere, honestly, if you live somewhere where that
[02:36:49.090 --> 02:36:52.390]  shit's inaccessible, maybe you're better off not growing there.
[02:36:52.390 --> 02:36:54.490]  You got to have real big balls to grow in that area.
[02:36:54.490 --> 02:36:57.390]  And shout out to you if you're going to do it, but we can't condone it
[02:36:57.390 --> 02:36:58.390]  and we can't encourage it.
[02:36:58.390 --> 02:37:01.390]  So, you're only listening to this for entertainment purposes where you are.
[02:37:01.390 --> 02:37:05.690]  Yeah, it's illegal, but also it's not immoral.
[02:37:05.790 --> 02:37:07.990]  So, and you're probably a grown-ass adult.
[02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:09.190]  So, yeah, yeah.
[02:37:10.190 --> 02:37:12.490]  You better be a grown-ass adult listening to this podcast.
[02:37:12.490 --> 02:37:15.290]  And iTunes and Stitcher, you got to be, it's an 18 and over show.
[02:37:15.290 --> 02:37:16.590]  So, hopefully you're an adult.
[02:37:17.590 --> 02:37:19.390]  All right, we've got kind of ranty there.
[02:37:20.590 --> 02:37:24.990]  So, also, last year in our area, we live in Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:37:24.990 --> 02:37:28.290]  This is kind of, it's not the valley, but we are kind of in a valley.
[02:37:28.290 --> 02:37:30.490]  We're surrounded by mountains on every side.
[02:37:30.490 --> 02:37:31.190]  We're in a bowl.
[02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.790]  We're in a bowl.
[02:37:31.790 --> 02:37:32.790]  That's a great way to put it.
[02:37:32.790 --> 02:37:33.590]  With the river flowing through the bowl.
[02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:35.490]  Shit, the other day we were in the dust bowl, bro.
[02:37:35.490 --> 02:37:37.490]  There was so much wind and dirt just blowing.
[02:37:37.490 --> 02:37:39.290]  I thought my car was getting sandblasted.
[02:37:39.290 --> 02:37:39.890]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:37:39.890 --> 02:37:40.890]  It was miserable.
[02:37:40.890 --> 02:37:42.090]  And it was cold too.
[02:37:42.090 --> 02:37:42.790]  It was weird.
[02:37:42.790 --> 02:37:43.090]  Yeah.
[02:37:43.090 --> 02:37:44.290]  But it was super sunshiny.
[02:37:44.290 --> 02:37:45.690]  Yeah, it was horrible.
[02:37:45.690 --> 02:37:51.190]  So, we're in this weird bowl and we get really strange weather changes and drastic weather changes.
[02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:55.190]  It'll be, today I used my heater and my air conditioner both in my car.
[02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:56.790]  Yeah, me too, several times.
[02:37:56.790 --> 02:38:02.390]  Yeah, right now it's 749 in the evening and I've got the front door open and two windows open.
[02:38:02.390 --> 02:38:03.890]  I thought I just heard the front door as I said that.
[02:38:03.890 --> 02:38:04.690]  That was really strange.
[02:38:04.690 --> 02:38:07.490]  I was looking for an open window to kind of judge what the weather was like.
[02:38:07.490 --> 02:38:07.990]  Right.
[02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:10.990]  But, so, yeah, it's, the weather changes a lot here.
[02:38:10.990 --> 02:38:15.190]  My point is, this caused a lot of folks to get powdery mildew last year.
[02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:19.390]  A lot of folks that grew outdoors, their plants were riddled with powdery mildew.
[02:38:19.390 --> 02:38:22.690]  So, what I'm getting at is, you've been growing outdoors for a lot of years now.
[02:38:22.690 --> 02:38:24.690]  Your dad's been growing outdoors for a hundred years.
[02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:26.590]  Shout out to the old man.
[02:38:26.590 --> 02:38:27.090]  What's up, brother?
[02:38:27.090 --> 02:38:28.090]  Good to hear from you.
[02:38:28.090 --> 02:38:28.790]  I hope you're doing well.
[02:38:30.190 --> 02:38:35.090]  How do you guys go about preventing and taking care of powdery mildew outdoors?
[02:38:35.690 --> 02:38:41.490]  You know, prevention, planning the areas.
[02:38:41.490 --> 02:38:45.590]  You know, we have plenty of circulation around our plants.
[02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:46.990]  We don't cram them together.
[02:38:46.990 --> 02:38:49.190]  We clean the, we hollow them out in the middles.
[02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:50.690]  We clean, shape the legs up.
[02:38:51.790 --> 02:38:53.890]  All that, you know, only goes so far though.
[02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:59.590]  You know, there's a few products, Azomax.
[02:38:59.590 --> 02:39:04.590]  I mean, I can't really recommend spraying anything on a bud, but if you have to, you have to.
[02:39:05.690 --> 02:39:12.790]  Azomax Green Cleaner, just good old H2 or H, hydrogen peroxide, H2O2.
[02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:21.190]  30%, hydrogen peroxide diluted at about 20 to 30 mils per gallon will help keep it away, but it will not stop it.
[02:39:21.890 --> 02:39:25.190]  More organically, teas would help.
[02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:26.990]  Like, you could even brew a tea with like neem milk.
[02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:30.490]  I think Sean would tell you to brew a nice compost tea with some Karanja and neem in there.
[02:39:30.590 --> 02:39:36.290]  I think you're going to want to fungus dominate to battle PM.
[02:39:36.290 --> 02:39:39.090]  Yeah, that'll disrupt the pH on the surface of the leaves.
[02:39:39.090 --> 02:39:39.390]  Yeah.
[02:39:40.690 --> 02:39:44.690]  And then, like, there's some plant teas you can make.
[02:39:44.690 --> 02:39:51.690]  I've been experimenting with chamomile, which is, it's a natural herb.
[02:39:52.390 --> 02:39:56.790]  You find it in a lot of like tea blends for like drinking like hot tea.
[02:39:57.090 --> 02:40:00.290]  It's considered a weed in most of the world.
[02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:06.790]  It grows naturally here in Colorado, so I'll be able to wild craft it in the fall.
[02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:14.790]  I've just been buying it from the health food store right now, but it's a natural antifungal and anti-
[02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:17.990]  Damn it, I'm stoned.
[02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:18.590]  Microbial.
[02:40:18.590 --> 02:40:19.990]  Yeah, antifungal.
[02:40:19.990 --> 02:40:21.790]  I'm not sure if that's the word you want, but it sounds good.
[02:40:21.790 --> 02:40:23.490]  Yeah, bacterial, that's what it is.
[02:40:23.490 --> 02:40:24.690]  Okay, antibacterial.
[02:40:25.090 --> 02:40:37.090]  So, I believe it makes a tea that has a higher pH was another thing I heard, but with those, you know, two properties, it battles PM pretty good, it looks like.
[02:40:37.090 --> 02:40:43.190]  So, and then also, added benefit of it is it's high in P and K.
[02:40:43.190 --> 02:40:45.290]  So, that's just another.
[02:40:45.290 --> 02:40:46.890]  You're going to help that increase trichomes.
[02:40:46.890 --> 02:40:53.290]  Yeah, that's, I'm actually right now, in my current run, I gave half my yeti OG plants a tea made of this.
[02:40:54.690 --> 02:40:58.190]  I'm week five right now, I think.
[02:40:58.190 --> 02:41:06.590]  I gave half of them a tea made of that, and then I gave the other half for that feeding, they just got water.
[02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:09.290]  So, I'm kind of kicking back, seeing what's happening.
[02:41:09.290 --> 02:41:10.490]  And wait and see what does what.
[02:41:10.490 --> 02:41:13.090]  That's always a good thing to do.
[02:41:13.090 --> 02:41:17.790]  How do you feel about, is it Oso 28?
[02:41:17.790 --> 02:41:19.690]  That seems like a really great, yeah, yeah.
[02:41:19.690 --> 02:41:21.390]  Okay, I get the numbers mixed up.
[02:41:21.390 --> 02:41:22.690]  There's so many numbers.
[02:41:22.690 --> 02:41:24.390]  Potassium silicate, I think.
[02:41:24.390 --> 02:41:24.890]  Yes.
[02:41:24.890 --> 02:41:25.390]  Something like that?
[02:41:25.390 --> 02:41:25.890]  Yes.
[02:41:25.890 --> 02:41:30.190]  A lot of growers I really respect are preaching it.
[02:41:30.190 --> 02:41:35.690]  I haven't used it personally yet, but it's a different kind of silica.
[02:41:35.690 --> 02:41:44.890]  And if you mix it in with almost any of your store bought foliar feeds, it really increases the effectiveness of both products, I think.
[02:41:44.890 --> 02:41:45.890]  Nice, I can see that.
[02:41:45.890 --> 02:41:53.590]  Sometimes, I've used it in conjunction with my integrated pest management system, and my plants love it.
[02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:58.490]  And it kind of helps the, whatever you're putting on the plants, it helps it stick a little better, I think, too.
[02:41:58.490 --> 02:42:00.090]  It works like a sticker spreader a little bit.
[02:42:00.090 --> 02:42:00.590]  Sweet.
[02:42:00.590 --> 02:42:04.590]  It's got the consistency of dish soap, almost, when you open up the bottle.
[02:42:04.590 --> 02:42:06.090]  I always stick my finger in shit.
[02:42:06.090 --> 02:42:07.490]  I know I'm not supposed to, but I want to know.
[02:42:07.490 --> 02:42:08.090]  I'm like, what is this?
[02:42:08.090 --> 02:42:10.090]  Like, I smell it and play with it.
[02:42:10.090 --> 02:42:11.390]  Almost taste it sometimes.
[02:42:11.390 --> 02:42:16.590]  Sometimes I want to, but there's, Sol Synthetics makes some products that I would drink.
[02:42:16.590 --> 02:42:21.990]  Like, if you served me a cup of, like, if I went to the Monte Factor and they handed me that, I'd go, that's fucking delicious.
[02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.690]  Like, what is this?
[02:42:22.690 --> 02:42:24.990]  It's Sol Synthetics, nitrogen blend?
[02:42:24.990 --> 02:42:26.490]  Like, let's get it on, bro.
[02:42:26.490 --> 02:42:26.990]  Like...
[02:42:28.990 --> 02:42:29.690]  What is it?
[02:42:29.690 --> 02:42:31.690]  Nectar for the God smells kind of good, too.
[02:42:31.690 --> 02:42:32.190]  Yeah.
[02:42:32.190 --> 02:42:32.690]  Yeah, kind of like a...
[02:42:32.690 --> 02:42:35.190]  They're very similar to Sol Synthetics, I think.
[02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:40.690]  And it was Sol Synthetics and another brand that I got some samples of, but there's a bunch of molasses in one of them.
[02:42:40.690 --> 02:42:41.190]  Nice.
[02:42:41.190 --> 02:42:42.390]  And it just smelled so yummy.
[02:42:42.390 --> 02:42:43.990]  I was like, oh, I can drink this.
[02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:46.990]  Humic acid and molasses together just give me this yummy flavor.
[02:42:46.990 --> 02:42:51.690]  Speaking of that, full power, you actually can drink, and it's actually good for you.
[02:42:51.690 --> 02:42:52.390]  That's funny.
[02:42:52.390 --> 02:42:54.890]  Yeah, it's a humic and fulvic...
[02:42:54.890 --> 02:42:59.390]  They have to label it as humic acid, but it's actually fulvic acid.
[02:42:59.390 --> 02:42:59.890]  Right.
[02:42:59.890 --> 02:43:01.690]  That has something to do with labeling laws.
[02:43:01.690 --> 02:43:05.190]  But, yeah, there's no warning on it.
[02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:07.190]  There's no real MSDS for it.
[02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:11.190]  So, I've heard Jeremy from Build a Soil talk about drinking it, too.
[02:43:11.190 --> 02:43:12.890]  That's what kind of got me to research it.
[02:43:12.890 --> 02:43:14.390]  I was like, this guy's nuts.
[02:43:15.090 --> 02:43:16.890]  He is nuts, but he's got a lot of great ideas.
[02:43:16.890 --> 02:43:17.390]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:43:17.390 --> 02:43:21.890]  But, I mean, I'm pretty, you know, he seems like a guy concerned about what's going into his body.
[02:43:22.390 --> 02:43:24.890]  Most of the Dragonfly Earth Medicine products are...
[02:43:24.890 --> 02:43:25.890]  Oh, yeah, guaranteed.
[02:43:25.890 --> 02:43:27.890]  That's mostly just alfalfa and wook juice.
[02:43:27.890 --> 02:43:28.890]  I love that shit, by the way.
[02:43:28.890 --> 02:43:29.890]  Yeah, it's such good stuff.
[02:43:29.890 --> 02:43:32.390]  If you need roots, use that Lush Roots.
[02:43:32.390 --> 02:43:39.890]  Just take your little baby clones where the roots are showing and just roll the clones in that Lush Roots and then put them into soil and they'll be root bound the next day.
[02:43:39.890 --> 02:43:40.390]  Oh, nice.
[02:43:40.390 --> 02:43:40.890]  And just...
[02:43:41.890 --> 02:43:43.890]  The fat flowers is a good one, too.
[02:43:43.890 --> 02:43:44.390]  Okay.
[02:43:44.390 --> 02:43:47.890]  I've run too big of a crop for the price of Dragonfly.
[02:43:47.890 --> 02:43:48.890]  Yeah, most definitely.
[02:43:48.890 --> 02:43:51.390]  That's for a boutique grower, for sure.
[02:43:51.390 --> 02:43:53.390]  Yeah, that's for three lights or less or something.
[02:43:53.390 --> 02:43:58.390]  Insect frass is amazing, but we could never use it at either one of our works because it's just...
[02:43:58.390 --> 02:43:58.890]  Right.
[02:43:58.890 --> 02:44:05.390]  It's the price it would take to make, you know, 300 gallons once a week of this shit is ridiculous.
[02:44:05.390 --> 02:44:08.890]  I kind of want to give a shout out to a product, but I'm not sure.
[02:44:08.890 --> 02:44:10.390]  Yeah, let's go for it.
[02:44:10.390 --> 02:44:11.390]  Big Time Exterminator.
[02:44:11.390 --> 02:44:13.390]  It seems to be working.
[02:44:13.390 --> 02:44:14.890]  That's all I've got to say about that.
[02:44:14.890 --> 02:44:15.890]  Big Time Exterminator.
[02:44:15.890 --> 02:44:16.390]  Right on.
[02:44:16.390 --> 02:44:18.390]  This comes in a black bottle with a skull on it.
[02:44:18.390 --> 02:44:19.890]  This is Big Time Exterminator on it.
[02:44:19.890 --> 02:44:20.890]  It's pretty rad.
[02:44:20.890 --> 02:44:24.890]  It's mostly organic and it's approved by the MED rules.
[02:44:24.890 --> 02:44:25.890]  Which is very important.
[02:44:25.890 --> 02:44:26.890]  Very important.
[02:44:26.890 --> 02:44:29.890]  And I feel like I've been adapting.
[02:44:29.890 --> 02:44:35.890]  I run a personal home grow, a caregiver grow for my patients, which is all legal and legit, and I can do whatever I want.
[02:44:35.890 --> 02:44:40.390]  Nobody looks at it, but I adapted the same MED rules to my personal grow.
[02:44:40.390 --> 02:44:41.390]  I kind of do, too.
[02:44:41.390 --> 02:44:44.390]  Like if they don't allow it there, then I got to throw it away also.
[02:44:44.390 --> 02:44:45.390]  There's no need for me to...
[02:44:45.390 --> 02:44:47.390]  And it keeps me learning here also.
[02:44:47.390 --> 02:44:47.890]  Yeah.
[02:44:47.890 --> 02:44:48.390]  And there.
[02:44:48.390 --> 02:44:50.390]  It keeps me prepared for both places.
[02:44:50.390 --> 02:44:51.390]  My wife, Bernadette.
[02:44:51.390 --> 02:44:52.390]  My wife.
[02:44:52.390 --> 02:44:53.390]  My wife.
[02:44:53.390 --> 02:44:59.390]  She's been studying that list very good and getting to know pesticides.
[02:44:59.390 --> 02:45:00.890]  I'm actually really proud of her.
[02:45:00.890 --> 02:45:01.390]  Good.
[02:45:01.390 --> 02:45:02.390]  Shout out to Bern.
[02:45:02.390 --> 02:45:09.390]  She has head growers from some of our clients calling her and asking her about stuff and what they can use and what they can't use.
[02:45:09.390 --> 02:45:13.390]  Because she knows more about it than the head grower for these gigantic grows.
[02:45:13.390 --> 02:45:16.890]  They email out lists to everybody at Metric.
[02:45:16.890 --> 02:45:17.390]  Oh, yeah.
[02:45:17.390 --> 02:45:20.390]  You get a list of all the new pesticides and all that stuff changes.
[02:45:20.390 --> 02:45:21.390]  We're signed up for that.
[02:45:21.390 --> 02:45:22.390]  I read it.
[02:45:22.390 --> 02:45:23.390]  I read it often.
[02:45:23.390 --> 02:45:24.390]  I have to.
[02:45:24.390 --> 02:45:25.390]  Yeah.
[02:45:25.390 --> 02:45:26.390]  She's actually...
[02:45:26.390 --> 02:45:32.390]  She tried calling the MED to talk to him about it one day, and a certain lady with...
[02:45:32.390 --> 02:45:37.390]  Her name starts with an M, called her back, and was not cool at all.
[02:45:37.390 --> 02:45:42.390]  But then we called the Department of Agriculture, and she ended up spending about an hour on the phone with the lady.
[02:45:42.390 --> 02:45:43.390]  Those guys are super cool.
[02:45:43.390 --> 02:45:45.390]  The Department of Ag is really cool.
[02:45:45.390 --> 02:45:48.390]  I hope they're the people that actually regulate us one day.
[02:45:48.390 --> 02:45:50.390]  That's one of my hopes and dreams.
[02:45:50.390 --> 02:45:54.390]  Gary had some great points on the show that we recorded last night that hasn't been released yet.
[02:45:54.390 --> 02:45:57.390]  Everybody that listens to the show has heard it by now, and you'll hear it.
[02:45:57.390 --> 02:45:59.390]  But there are some great things that kind of go along with that statement.
[02:45:59.390 --> 02:46:00.390]  It'll be entertaining.
[02:46:00.390 --> 02:46:02.390]  So, powdery mildew.
[02:46:02.390 --> 02:46:05.390]  How the hell are we getting rid of that?
[02:46:05.390 --> 02:46:06.390]  Remind me again.
[02:46:06.390 --> 02:46:08.390]  Oh, we're mixing up some spray.
[02:46:08.390 --> 02:46:09.390]  Yeah, chamomile.
[02:46:09.390 --> 02:46:11.390]  Chamomile tea all over the plants.
[02:46:11.390 --> 02:46:12.390]  It'll disrupt the pH.
[02:46:12.390 --> 02:46:14.390]  Okay, I want to make sure that we covered that one.
[02:46:14.390 --> 02:46:19.390]  I bet adding some silica to that tea to help raise the pH even more would probably be real killer.
[02:46:19.390 --> 02:46:25.390]  Big time exterminator with some Osa-28 in there would be really, really effective on PM is what I would assume.
[02:46:25.390 --> 02:46:28.390]  I'm going to have to try the big time exterminator.
[02:46:28.390 --> 02:46:30.390]  We have it at the store, but I've never used it.
[02:46:30.390 --> 02:46:31.390]  Oh, really?
[02:46:31.390 --> 02:46:32.390]  Cool.
[02:46:32.390 --> 02:46:33.390]  I didn't know that.
[02:46:33.390 --> 02:46:34.390]  Flying Skull.
[02:46:34.390 --> 02:46:36.390]  We have another one of their products, too.
[02:46:36.390 --> 02:46:37.390]  I can't remember what it's called.
[02:46:37.390 --> 02:46:38.390]  The enzyme?
[02:46:38.390 --> 02:46:39.390]  Big time enzyme?
[02:46:39.390 --> 02:46:40.390]  Big time roots?
[02:46:40.390 --> 02:46:41.390]  Big time inoculate?
[02:46:41.390 --> 02:46:42.390]  Yeah, it's one of those.
[02:46:42.390 --> 02:46:43.390]  You should see the store.
[02:46:43.390 --> 02:46:44.390]  That's a good shout out.
[02:46:44.390 --> 02:46:45.390]  Those are good products.
[02:46:45.390 --> 02:46:46.390]  I like the big time.
[02:46:46.390 --> 02:46:47.390]  There's one with coconut oil and some other things in it.
[02:46:47.390 --> 02:46:48.390]  I really approve of that one.
[02:46:48.390 --> 02:46:49.390]  Nice, nice.
[02:46:49.390 --> 02:46:50.390]  All right.
[02:46:50.390 --> 02:46:52.390]  So if you guys do, here's another side note.
[02:46:52.390 --> 02:46:57.390]  If you do have buds that have powdery mildew on them, I know it sounds like the easy way out.
[02:46:57.390 --> 02:47:00.390]  Do not blast them and turn them into BHO.
[02:47:00.390 --> 02:47:01.390]  Please not.
[02:47:01.390 --> 02:47:02.390]  Please don't do that.
[02:47:02.390 --> 02:47:04.390]  Don't press them and turn them into rosin.
[02:47:04.390 --> 02:47:07.390]  We don't want to taste your burnt popcorn and powdery mildew.
[02:47:07.390 --> 02:47:11.390]  I haven't seen any powdery mildew rosin yet.
[02:47:11.390 --> 02:47:13.390]  You know it's going to happen though.
[02:47:13.390 --> 02:47:14.390]  Eventually it's coming.
[02:47:14.390 --> 02:47:15.390]  I made a joke the other day.
[02:47:15.390 --> 02:47:20.390]  I said, well, since everybody learned how to make BHO, nobody gets powdery mildew anymore.
[02:47:20.390 --> 02:47:22.390]  It's a sick truth.
[02:47:22.390 --> 02:47:23.390]  You never see it.
[02:47:23.390 --> 02:47:24.390]  Nobody's like, I lost a whole crop to PM.
[02:47:24.390 --> 02:47:25.390]  Or yeah, we got PM.
[02:47:25.390 --> 02:47:27.390]  It's like, no, we have a whole bunch of shatter.
[02:47:27.390 --> 02:47:28.390]  That's what you see now.
[02:47:28.390 --> 02:47:29.390]  I know a few people.
[02:47:29.390 --> 02:47:30.390]  They think it's safe.
[02:47:30.390 --> 02:47:31.390]  Yeah, and it's not.
[02:47:31.390 --> 02:47:32.390]  I'm not a scientist.
[02:47:32.390 --> 02:47:33.390]  I'm not a chemistry student.
[02:47:33.390 --> 02:47:34.390]  I'm not qualified to give this speech.
[02:47:34.390 --> 02:47:35.390]  But this is what I understand about the BHO.
[02:47:35.390 --> 02:47:36.390]  I'm not a chemist.
[02:47:36.390 --> 02:47:37.390]  I'm not a chemist.
[02:47:37.390 --> 02:47:38.390]  I'm not a chemist.
[02:47:38.390 --> 02:47:39.390]  I'm not a chemist.
[02:47:39.390 --> 02:47:46.190]  But this is what I understand about the idea of blasting powdery mildew covered buds.
[02:47:46.190 --> 02:47:49.190]  Some folks say that the PM will not get through the screen.
[02:47:49.190 --> 02:47:50.310]  Good enough if it doesn't.
[02:47:50.310 --> 02:47:51.310]  Maybe it won't.
[02:47:51.310 --> 02:47:52.310]  Maybe it'll stay in the tube.
[02:47:52.310 --> 02:47:54.550]  Maybe it's right there pressed up against the screen, just like your coffee, and it's
[02:47:54.550 --> 02:47:57.030]  not getting through and only the coffee's coming through.
[02:47:57.030 --> 02:48:01.910]  But what is coming through, maybe not the spores and not the mildew, but there are mycotoxins
[02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:05.870]  inside of those spores that have been extracted just like your cannabinoids and your terpenes.
[02:48:05.870 --> 02:48:07.030]  They've been washed off.
[02:48:07.030 --> 02:48:12.790]  If you're getting the mycotoxins, which are going to affect you in the long run, if you
[02:48:12.790 --> 02:48:15.430]  inhale the spores, you'll get that sooner.
[02:48:15.430 --> 02:48:16.430]  You'll get an infection in your lungs.
[02:48:16.430 --> 02:48:17.430]  You'll get an irritation.
[02:48:17.430 --> 02:48:21.350]  The mycotoxins are going to take a little while to infect your body, and it's going
[02:48:21.350 --> 02:48:22.350]  to be different.
[02:48:22.350 --> 02:48:23.350]  You're going to have fungus inside your body.
[02:48:23.350 --> 02:48:25.430]  You got mycotoxins running around inside your lungs now.
[02:48:25.430 --> 02:48:26.990]  They're going to get in your bloodstream.
[02:48:26.990 --> 02:48:27.990]  I'm not a doctor.
[02:48:27.990 --> 02:48:29.990]  I don't know enough about that.
[02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:34.230]  But I do know that it's not a good idea because you're just washing the mycotoxins off the
[02:48:34.230 --> 02:48:36.190]  mildew into your hash.
[02:48:36.350 --> 02:48:39.470]  People are going to make edibles out of that hash sometimes, and they're going to consume
[02:48:39.470 --> 02:48:41.670]  and eat that shit, and they're going to smoke it.
[02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:44.910]  This is supposed to be something that improves the quality of people's lives, not makes us
[02:48:44.910 --> 02:48:46.990]  sicker, not fucks us up.
[02:48:46.990 --> 02:48:49.110]  Please do not blast your powdery mildew, buds.
[02:48:49.110 --> 02:48:52.710]  The only thing that I recommend, I've never done this.
[02:48:52.710 --> 02:48:54.310]  Shout out to Sean and Jordan.
[02:48:54.310 --> 02:48:55.310]  That's all there.
[02:48:55.310 --> 02:48:56.910]  I don't know what else to call them, Sean and Jordan.
[02:48:56.910 --> 02:48:57.910]  Some friends of mine.
[02:48:57.910 --> 02:49:05.310]  They say that you can take the 30% hydrogen peroxide and put it in distilled water, and
[02:49:05.310 --> 02:49:06.310]  you can mix that up.
[02:49:06.310 --> 02:49:12.310]  They say you can dunk your PM covered buds or PM dosed buds in that, and then hang them
[02:49:12.310 --> 02:49:15.630]  up and they will dry, and that will cure your powdery mildew problem.
[02:49:15.630 --> 02:49:16.630]  I've heard that.
[02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:17.630]  I've never done it either.
[02:49:17.630 --> 02:49:18.630]  I'm skeptical.
[02:49:18.630 --> 02:49:20.310]  I don't know that I can recommend that.
[02:49:20.310 --> 02:49:21.910]  If anybody has done that, email me.
[02:49:21.910 --> 02:49:22.910]  It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[02:49:22.910 --> 02:49:25.910]  I'd love to hear what your experience about that with that.
[02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:31.830]  On that subject, I've heard that you can wash your buds the exact same way like your outdoor
[02:49:31.830 --> 02:49:35.190]  buds to wash the dirts and stuff off of them.
[02:49:35.270 --> 02:49:38.670]  I'm doing that exact same thing, but without the hydrogen peroxide.
[02:49:38.670 --> 02:49:39.670]  Just water.
[02:49:39.670 --> 02:49:40.670]  Just go out there with the hose and just get them.
[02:49:40.670 --> 02:49:44.310]  If anyone's done that, let Jeff know about that too, because I'd like to hear.
[02:49:44.310 --> 02:49:48.550]  I had a friend named Donovan who was known as DJ Danky online back in the day.
[02:49:48.550 --> 02:49:51.350]  I don't know if I'm supposed to say his real name and his online name.
[02:49:51.350 --> 02:49:53.950]  That doesn't exist anymore, so we're cool.
[02:49:53.950 --> 02:49:57.270]  He used to say that he would rinse his buds off just like a week before harvest.
[02:49:57.270 --> 02:49:59.950]  He's like, I'd just go in there and rinse them off with a spray bottle and hose them
[02:49:59.950 --> 02:50:04.590]  down just to get all the dust off of them, which is a good idea because in my opinion,
[02:50:04.590 --> 02:50:08.430]  all that dust that you kick up during the grow season, it's been windy as shit out
[02:50:08.430 --> 02:50:09.430]  here.
[02:50:09.430 --> 02:50:13.190]  If people got plants out, if it's this windy in the middle of the flowering season, people
[02:50:13.190 --> 02:50:17.390]  are going to have buds that are just covered in dirt on one side.
[02:50:17.390 --> 02:50:18.390]  That's going into your hash.
[02:50:18.390 --> 02:50:23.150]  You're just going to blast that right into the pot of gold right there.
[02:50:23.150 --> 02:50:26.030]  Dirt extract is going to taste like earth.
[02:50:26.030 --> 02:50:28.190]  Maybe cleaning off the buds is a good idea in this region.
[02:50:28.190 --> 02:50:30.630]  I'm going to try it this summer.
[02:50:30.630 --> 02:50:36.070]  It sounds lazy, but in my personal grow room, I quit sweeping around week six.
[02:50:36.070 --> 02:50:37.630]  The buds are getting sticky.
[02:50:37.630 --> 02:50:38.630]  Everything's real sticky.
[02:50:38.630 --> 02:50:44.470]  I don't want to stir up any dust or dirt off of the floor into those buds, so I will let
[02:50:44.470 --> 02:50:48.110]  it get funky from about week ... I mean, there's not a lot of shit on the floor.
[02:50:48.110 --> 02:50:51.910]  I'm not in there eating snacks or anything, but there are leaves and you spill soil when
[02:50:51.910 --> 02:50:54.990]  you kick pots occasionally and shit happens.
[02:50:54.990 --> 02:51:00.230]  I won't sweep sometimes from week six or seven until after harvest or at the end of harvest.
[02:51:00.230 --> 02:51:02.630]  Cut off all the leaves pre-harvest and then sweep up.
[02:51:02.630 --> 02:51:05.030]  It is pretty much the same thing.
[02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:08.310]  Cut down the plants pre-harvest, cut down the plants and then sweep up and clean up.
[02:51:08.310 --> 02:51:09.310]  Start fresh.
[02:51:09.310 --> 02:51:12.990]  Spray the whole room with hydrogen peroxide water and fucking clean it up.
[02:51:12.990 --> 02:51:13.990]  Vomit.
[02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:14.990]  Yeah, vomit.
[02:51:14.990 --> 02:51:15.990]  Clean it up.
[02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.990]  Redo the flooring.
[02:51:16.990 --> 02:51:17.990]  Fix all the ducting.
[02:51:17.990 --> 02:51:19.710]  That should be a whole episode, what to do between grows.
[02:51:19.710 --> 02:51:21.830]  We could probably talk for six weeks about that.
[02:51:21.830 --> 02:51:22.830]  Oh, yeah.
[02:51:22.830 --> 02:51:26.350]  That's an untouched subject a lot.
[02:51:26.350 --> 02:51:27.350]  Yeah.
[02:51:27.350 --> 02:51:28.630]  We've been going for about 40 minutes, dude.
[02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:31.230]  I think we gave the folks a decent start.
[02:51:31.230 --> 02:51:33.390]  All we did was tell them how to mix up some soil.
[02:51:33.390 --> 02:51:36.310]  Dig some big holes and put all that stuff inside of it and then put your little baby
[02:51:36.310 --> 02:51:41.670]  plants in there about May 15th to June 5th-ish.
[02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:42.710]  And then keep an eye on them.
[02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:44.230]  Keep them watered decently.
[02:51:44.230 --> 02:51:49.430]  Just real quick, do your soil at least two weeks before.
[02:51:49.430 --> 02:51:51.070]  Cover the top of the hole with plastic.
[02:51:52.070 --> 02:51:59.470]  helps accelerate the composting process of the raw amendments being broken down and being
[02:51:59.470 --> 02:52:00.470]  plant available.
[02:52:00.470 --> 02:52:01.470]  Earthworms are great.
[02:52:01.470 --> 02:52:02.470]  Yeah.
[02:52:02.470 --> 02:52:03.470]  Throw some worms in there if you can.
[02:52:03.470 --> 02:52:04.470]  Mulching is awesome.
[02:52:04.470 --> 02:52:15.470]  Your hole size, it kind of depends on the size of your plant and how big it can get,
[02:52:15.470 --> 02:52:18.910]  but at least three by three hole.
[02:52:19.150 --> 02:52:22.910]  With cannabis, you only need to go down about 18 inches.
[02:52:22.910 --> 02:52:27.910]  There's no need to try to fill a fucking six foot hole full of highly enriched soil.
[02:52:27.910 --> 02:52:29.910]  It gets expensive quickly.
[02:52:29.910 --> 02:52:30.910]  Yeah.
[02:52:30.910 --> 02:52:31.910]  It's just a lot of work and it gets really expensive.
[02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:34.910]  Go get you some bales of Pro-Mix.
[02:52:34.910 --> 02:52:35.910]  Yeah.
[02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:36.910]  It's a good start.
[02:52:36.910 --> 02:52:38.910]  Dude, thanks for coming and being on the podcast.
[02:52:38.910 --> 02:52:39.910]  For sure.
[02:52:39.910 --> 02:52:40.910]  For sure.
[02:52:40.910 --> 02:52:41.910]  Tell everybody how they can follow you on social media.
[02:52:41.910 --> 02:52:42.910]  Yeah.
[02:52:42.910 --> 02:52:43.910]  Can I shout out mine?
[02:52:43.910 --> 02:52:44.910]  Yeah, dude.
[02:52:44.910 --> 02:52:45.910]  Shout it out.
[02:52:45.910 --> 02:52:46.910]  For sure.
[02:52:46.910 --> 02:52:51.830]  You can follow me on Instagram at Jesse Gross.
[02:52:51.830 --> 02:52:58.030]  You can hit me up on Facebook if you know how to do that.
[02:52:58.030 --> 02:53:04.150]  You can also check out my podcast that I would have never started without being on Jeff's
[02:53:04.150 --> 02:53:05.150]  show.
[02:53:05.150 --> 02:53:06.150]  Well, thank you, bro.
[02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:13.710]  A lot of ... He's already taught me a lot and everything, but it's the Coloradope Podcast.
[02:53:13.710 --> 02:53:19.230]  C-O-L-O-R-A-D-O-P-E Podcast.
[02:53:19.230 --> 02:53:24.510]  Right now we're just on SoundCloud and then we're also on Facebook as the same thing.
[02:53:24.510 --> 02:53:28.310]  Our email's coloradopepodcast at gmail.com.
[02:53:28.310 --> 02:53:32.310]  What do you guys talk about on the Coloradope Podcast?
[02:53:32.310 --> 02:53:34.630]  Cannabis, lifestyle.
[02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:39.710]  One of the other hosts is 44, so he makes his special little flavor.
[02:53:39.710 --> 02:53:40.710]  Nice.
[02:53:40.710 --> 02:53:41.710]  Shout out to 44.
[02:53:41.710 --> 02:53:42.710]  Then our other host-
[02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:43.710]  You should call him 44 and 2 now.
[02:53:43.710 --> 02:53:44.710]  I tried calling him 45.
[02:53:44.710 --> 02:53:45.710]  He didn't think that was too funny.
[02:53:45.710 --> 02:53:46.710]  Yeah.
[02:53:46.710 --> 02:53:47.710]  We still love you, bro.
[02:53:47.710 --> 02:53:48.710]  You're still on the team.
[02:53:48.710 --> 02:53:49.710]  Don't worry.
[02:53:49.710 --> 02:53:50.710]  Then my good lifelong friend, Despicable Derek, or Dank Derek, whatever you want to call him.
[02:53:50.710 --> 02:53:51.710]  Dirty Derek.
[02:53:51.710 --> 02:53:52.710]  He is pretty involved.
[02:53:52.710 --> 02:53:53.710]  Is that Fish?
[02:53:53.710 --> 02:53:54.710]  Yeah.
[02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:55.710]  Fish?
[02:53:55.710 --> 02:53:56.710]  Yeah.
[02:53:56.710 --> 02:53:57.710]  Fish.
[02:53:57.710 --> 02:53:58.710]  I haven't heard him called Fish in a long time.
[02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:59.710]  Fish number two.
[02:53:59.710 --> 02:54:00.710]  All of us that have known him a long time know his cousin too.
[02:54:00.710 --> 02:54:01.710]  Okay.
[02:54:01.710 --> 02:54:02.710]  He's a great guy.
[02:54:02.710 --> 02:54:03.710]  He's a great guy.
[02:54:03.710 --> 02:54:04.710]  He's a great guy.
[02:54:04.710 --> 02:54:05.710]  He's a great guy.
[02:54:05.710 --> 02:54:06.710]  He's a great guy.
[02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:07.710]  He's a great guy.
[02:54:07.710 --> 02:54:08.710]  He's a great guy.
[02:54:08.710 --> 02:54:09.710]  He's a great guy.
[02:54:09.710 --> 02:54:12.910]  All of us that have known him a long time know his cousin too.
[02:54:12.910 --> 02:54:15.310]  We all met the cousin first, so that's Fish number one.
[02:54:15.310 --> 02:54:16.310]  Ah.
[02:54:16.310 --> 02:54:17.310]  Yeah.
[02:54:17.310 --> 02:54:18.310]  He's backup Fish.
[02:54:18.310 --> 02:54:19.310]  Yep.
[02:54:19.310 --> 02:54:25.470]  But he's real active in the local hip hop and music scene, so he adds that to it.
[02:54:25.470 --> 02:54:30.270]  And we are quite a bit more unorthodox than Jeff's very professional show.
[02:54:30.270 --> 02:54:34.470]  So we cuss and talk about a few gross things and shit.
[02:54:34.470 --> 02:54:35.470]  We've done that on this show.
[02:54:35.470 --> 02:54:36.470]  Oh, yeah.
[02:54:36.470 --> 02:54:37.470]  No, no.
[02:54:37.470 --> 02:54:38.470]  We've done that here.
[02:54:38.470 --> 02:54:39.470]  44 has been on this show.
[02:54:40.230 --> 02:54:41.230]  I remember a moose knuckle episode or something.
[02:54:41.230 --> 02:54:42.230]  Clint's been here also.
[02:54:42.230 --> 02:54:43.230]  Oh, true, true.
[02:54:43.230 --> 02:54:44.230]  Yeah.
[02:54:44.230 --> 02:54:45.230]  Shout out to Clint.
[02:54:45.230 --> 02:54:46.230]  I hope you listen to the podcast, bro.
[02:54:46.230 --> 02:54:47.230]  If you do, message me and let me know.
[02:54:47.230 --> 02:54:48.230]  We got to get together.
[02:54:48.230 --> 02:54:49.230]  He left something here last time you were here.
[02:54:49.230 --> 02:54:50.230]  Uh-oh.
[02:54:50.230 --> 02:54:51.230]  I hope it wasn't his virginity.
[02:54:51.230 --> 02:54:52.230]  Oh.
[02:54:52.230 --> 02:54:53.230]  Oh.
[02:54:53.230 --> 02:54:54.230]  I stole it from him.
[02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:55.230]  I think we're going to wrap up the show on that note.
[02:54:55.230 --> 02:54:56.230]  Dude, thanks for coming and taking an hour out of your day.
[02:54:56.230 --> 02:54:57.230]  We're going to take some dabs before you leave.
[02:54:57.230 --> 02:54:58.230]  Smoke some of this Spirax.
[02:54:58.230 --> 02:54:59.230]  Hell yeah.
[02:54:59.230 --> 02:55:00.230]  If anybody out there is interested in sponsoring a podcast or if you've got a product you'd
[02:55:00.230 --> 02:55:01.230]  like to sponsor, you can do that.
[02:55:01.230 --> 02:55:02.230]  We're going to do that.
[02:55:02.410 --> 02:55:03.510]  free balling.
[02:55:03.510 --> 02:55:04.510]  Yeah.
[02:55:04.510 --> 02:55:06.070]  Free, free, free forming.
[02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:08.190]  You're totally doing that, too.
[02:55:08.190 --> 02:55:21.030]  If you've got a product you'd like me to review, I will not talk about free balling in the
[02:55:21.030 --> 02:55:24.470]  advertisement of your product or as I review your product, but if you've got a product
[02:55:24.470 --> 02:55:27.430]  you'd like me to review or if you'd like to advertise on the show, send me an email.

[02:55:28.430 --> 02:55:31.950]  I would love to work something out with you.
[02:55:31.950 --> 02:55:33.270]  Um, I think that's all I've got.

[02:55:50.830 --> 02:55:51.310]  Thank you, bro.
[02:55:51.310 --> 02:55:51.990]  I appreciate that.
[02:55:51.990 --> 02:55:53.390]  You've been at it for a while, so that means a lot.
[02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:54.510]  No, I like your style.
[02:55:54.590 --> 02:55:56.110]  I'm on a lot of the social media.

[02:56:03.710 --> 02:56:04.910]  Big shout out to my ninja Spence.

[02:58:25.410 --> 02:58:26.370]  All right, podcast world.

[02:58:52.690 --> 02:58:54.770]  fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
