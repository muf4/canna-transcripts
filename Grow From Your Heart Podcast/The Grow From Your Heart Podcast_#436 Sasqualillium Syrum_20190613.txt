[00:00.000 --> 00:01.840]  Hey, what's up, podcast world?
[00:01.840 --> 00:05.660]  It is time for episode 436 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.660 --> 00:08.520]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:08.520 --> 00:12.920]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
[00:12.920 --> 00:18.500]  them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:18.500 --> 00:21.560]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:21.560 --> 00:26.200]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Malibu Pure Kush Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[00:26.200 --> 00:27.200]  Farms.
[00:27.200 --> 00:34.680]  The label says this product contains 69.3% THC and 82.1% total cannabinoids.
[00:34.680 --> 00:38.600]  I really like the flavor and aromas of the Malibu Pure Kush, and I really like the way
[00:38.600 --> 00:39.840]  it just kind of chills me out.
[00:39.840 --> 00:44.240]  It makes my body feel real nice, and I think it's great podcasting concentrates.
[00:44.240 --> 00:49.920]  So big shout out to our friends at Apothecary Farms for the Malibu Pure Kush Ambrosia.
[00:49.920 --> 00:53.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, I am going to read a listener email, and I am also
[00:53.580 --> 00:55.800]  going to read some comments from YouTube.
[00:55.800 --> 01:00.760]  Before we do that, let's give a shout out to a few of our friends from Patreon.
[01:00.760 --> 01:02.560]  Let's start off with a big old shout out to Miss Mel.
[01:02.560 --> 01:06.680]  How about a big gigantic Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Matthew KW.
[01:06.680 --> 01:09.920]  Of course, a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Steve F.
[01:09.920 --> 01:11.320]  As always, a shout out to BAFSTA.
[01:11.320 --> 01:14.340]  I want to give a big giant shout out to Isaac Green.
[01:14.340 --> 01:17.960]  Of course, a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Squirrel Tactics.
[01:17.960 --> 01:22.920]  And of course, a big fist bump and Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to my new friend,
[01:22.920 --> 01:23.920]  Killin' Kind.
[01:24.360 --> 01:27.240]  I want to thank all of you for the continued Patreon support.
[01:27.240 --> 01:34.040]  And if you would like to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to www.patreon.com
[01:34.040 --> 01:36.120]  slash growfromyourheart.
[01:36.120 --> 01:39.480]  All of the information you need should be right there on the screen.
[01:39.480 --> 01:43.400]  All right, what else should we talk about before we jump into this email?
[01:43.400 --> 01:45.880]  Let's talk about feminized seeds.
[01:45.880 --> 01:47.840]  I usually update you guys on my breeding.
[01:47.840 --> 01:53.060]  I haven't been talking about my breeding projects as much lately, but I recently harvested a
[01:53.180 --> 01:56.580]  large batch of feminized seeds.
[01:56.580 --> 02:00.300]  A lot of people often ask me, when will there be more Lemon Jeffrey seeds?
[02:00.300 --> 02:04.060]  A lot of people ask me when I will have more feminized Golden Goat seeds.
[02:04.060 --> 02:06.380]  The answer is July 10th.
[02:06.380 --> 02:08.540]  Those seeds will drop on July 10th.
[02:08.540 --> 02:11.040]  Make sure you check out my vendors on July 10th.
[02:11.040 --> 02:13.920]  They should be available at seedsherenow.com.
[02:13.920 --> 02:20.120]  They should be available at Oregon Elite Seeds, and they should be available at dankseed.store.
[02:20.120 --> 02:27.280]  They will also be available at the Dude Grows 710 Concentration Celebration on July 13th
[02:27.280 --> 02:30.600]  at Cultivated Synergy at the iReGenetics booth.
[02:30.600 --> 02:36.340]  I'm not trying to sound like too much of a sales guy, but these seeds will go quickly,
[02:36.340 --> 02:39.440]  so don't sleep on the new drop of feminized seeds.
[02:39.440 --> 02:44.560]  These will drop on 710 on the websites, and they will be available on 713 at the Dude
[02:44.560 --> 02:52.640]  Grows Concentration Celebration 710 event in Denver at Cultivated Synergy in very limited quantities.
[02:52.640 --> 02:55.600]  I will have the Lemon Jeffrey feminized seeds.
[02:55.600 --> 03:01.000]  I will have Golden Goat feminized seeds, and I will have the brand new, never-before-released
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.600]  Orange Gasm seeds in very limited quantities.
[03:04.600 --> 03:10.560]  Come see me at the Dude Grows Concentration Celebration on 713 at Cultivated Synergy,
[03:10.560 --> 03:16.120]  or check out those websites I mentioned before, seedsherenow.com, Oregon Elite Seeds, and
[03:16.120 --> 03:22.360]  dankseed.store on 710 for the fresh feminized seed drop.
[03:22.360 --> 03:28.620]  I've also been getting a lot of requests for detailed information about my feeding mix
[03:28.620 --> 03:30.560]  and my nutrient recipes.
[03:30.560 --> 03:33.120]  I mentioned before that I use Vegebloom as a base.
[03:33.120 --> 03:35.960]  I've mentioned that I add in some new Millennium products.
[03:35.960 --> 03:39.760]  Since I went on the Dude Grows show and mentioned my mix, since I mentioned some of my mix on
[03:39.760 --> 03:45.960]  my podcast, I get at least two or three emails every single day asking about my mix.
[03:45.960 --> 03:52.100]  So in the future, I will do a fully detailed episode on what I'm using for Vegebloom and
[03:52.100 --> 03:54.080]  new Millennium and a couple of other things.
[03:54.080 --> 03:58.620]  I'll give you some very good ideas, some very thorough information on my nutrient mix and
[03:58.620 --> 04:00.560]  options for your setup.
[04:00.560 --> 04:04.360]  When I do episodes that are really in-depth like that, and I feel like a lot of people
[04:04.360 --> 04:09.000]  are going to cling to every word and follow my advice very closely, I do my best to make
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.720]  sure to give accurate information.
[04:11.720 --> 04:15.160]  So this episode will take me a little bit of time to put together, but it will be worth
[04:15.160 --> 04:16.160]  your wait.
[04:16.160 --> 04:21.480]  So in the near future, you will get a nutrient recipe episode that is mainly focused on what
[04:21.480 --> 04:25.160]  I mix in a home grow and in a commercial environment.
[04:25.160 --> 04:29.120]  Now please keep in mind, I said it's going to take me a little bit to create those episodes.
[04:29.120 --> 04:30.440]  They're going to be very detailed.
[04:30.440 --> 04:32.200]  I want them to be very accurate.
[04:32.200 --> 04:34.920]  So please be patient, but I will make it worth your wait.
[04:34.920 --> 04:35.920]  All right.
[04:35.920 --> 04:39.440]  So let's move into this email that I've got sitting here in front of me.
[04:39.440 --> 04:43.360]  Recently I did an episode about carbon filters and carbon filter placement.
[04:43.360 --> 04:48.760]  We got a great email from a listener who wanted to add on some advice to that information.
[04:48.760 --> 04:52.120]  And I definitely encourage and welcome updated information.
[04:52.120 --> 04:56.200]  If I say something on the show and you agree or disagree, or if you've got something to
[04:56.200 --> 04:58.720]  add onto it, please do reach out to me.
[04:58.720 --> 05:02.720]  If you'd like to correct me, if you'd like to expand on my knowledge, please help me
[05:02.720 --> 05:03.720]  out.
[05:03.720 --> 05:04.720]  Don't be afraid.
[05:04.720 --> 05:05.720]  I am not afraid to be corrected.
[05:06.520 --> 05:07.520]  I am not afraid to learn more.
[05:07.520 --> 05:08.520]  I want to expand my brain.
[05:08.520 --> 05:09.600]  So fill me up with knowledge.
[05:09.600 --> 05:13.160]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[05:13.160 --> 05:16.000]  This listener sent the email that goes like this.
[05:16.000 --> 05:17.360]  Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[05:17.360 --> 05:21.000]  I listened to the carbon filter episode and I thought I would chime in with a couple of
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.000]  things.
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.280]  I am in a location that requires absolutely zero smell and they put zero in all capitals.
[05:28.280 --> 05:32.920]  So they mean zero smell, which in my experience is pretty difficult to achieve.
[05:33.120 --> 05:37.120]  Yes, if you're growing dank herb, zero smell is difficult to achieve.
[05:37.120 --> 05:39.640]  Even veg plants put off a very distinct aroma.
[05:39.640 --> 05:41.800]  It smells like growing vegetation.
[05:41.800 --> 05:45.480]  As soon as you flip the flower, you start putting off that dank aroma.
[05:45.480 --> 05:49.740]  So sometimes it is pretty difficult to achieve zero smell.
[05:49.740 --> 05:52.320]  With a carbon filter, we can minimize aromas.
[05:52.320 --> 05:56.180]  With careful duct tape and careful caulking, we can absolutely minimize aromas.
[05:56.180 --> 05:58.200]  This person has some great contributions.
[05:58.200 --> 06:02.800]  It says, even with a 24 inch carbon filter for a six inch fan, I was catching a whiff
[06:02.800 --> 06:08.200]  of sweet dankness outside of my discharge point, which happens to be outside for me.
[06:08.200 --> 06:12.160]  Which now that means a lot of people have access to that smell.
[06:12.160 --> 06:15.000]  Maybe you've got it near a part of the house where you think no one's going to go there,
[06:15.000 --> 06:16.980]  but you never know what happens.
[06:16.980 --> 06:20.480]  Sometimes a kid hits a baseball, it bounces three times, it lands right there by that
[06:20.480 --> 06:21.480]  duct or that van.
[06:21.480 --> 06:24.600]  That little kid runs over there to get the baseball and he goes, damn, it smells dank
[06:24.600 --> 06:25.600]  over here.
[06:25.600 --> 06:28.680]  If you kids nowadays know what dank weed smells like, you're busted.
[06:28.680 --> 06:30.960]  It only takes something simple and stupid like that.
[06:30.960 --> 06:33.800]  So zero aroma is the goal for this listener.
[06:33.800 --> 06:36.180]  And here is some of the advice that they sent us.
[06:36.180 --> 06:41.760]  It says, one of the ways I corrected the issue was to use rope caulk, easily found at any
[06:41.760 --> 06:45.920]  home improvement center, to seal all of the joints in my ductwork.
[06:45.920 --> 06:47.560]  This is super important.
[06:47.560 --> 06:52.380]  And then I added another carbon filter at the discharge point just in case.
[06:52.380 --> 06:56.180]  So this guy's got air going in through a carbon filter and also out through a carbon
[06:56.180 --> 06:57.720]  filter at the other end.
[06:57.720 --> 07:02.920]  So he is double scrubbing the air and he is also using rope caulk on every joint.
[07:02.920 --> 07:06.620]  So you're typically going to have your carbon filter and then your blower.
[07:06.620 --> 07:08.060]  You need to caulk between there.
[07:08.060 --> 07:10.860]  Then you will have your blower and probably some ductwork.
[07:10.860 --> 07:13.740]  You will need to caulk between the blower and the ducting.
[07:13.740 --> 07:17.460]  Wherever that ducting attaches, you need to caulk that as well.
[07:17.460 --> 07:20.220]  If you have more parts, caulk all of that.
[07:20.220 --> 07:26.220]  If you've got a grow light with glass between the bulb and the canopy so that that grow
[07:26.220 --> 07:30.460]  light is sealed so you can move air over and cool those lights, you probably need to seal
[07:30.460 --> 07:33.060]  all of that up with caulking as well.
[07:33.060 --> 07:37.060]  If zero aroma is your goal, you cannot be too careful.
[07:37.060 --> 07:39.620]  I would put some type of sealant on every joint.
[07:39.620 --> 07:44.940]  Then I would wrap that again with duct tape just to make sure if zero aroma is the goal,
[07:44.940 --> 07:49.900]  we want to go extreme and make sure that zero aroma escapes this grow space.
[07:50.580 --> 07:53.260]  Now, when I was talking about sealing up the light, we need to be careful if we have got
[07:53.260 --> 07:54.420]  a ducted light hood.
[07:54.420 --> 07:56.860]  We need to carefully seal that glass.
[07:56.860 --> 07:58.100]  Think about it this way.
[07:58.100 --> 08:03.080]  You've got plants directly under that light and you were blowing air over that light.
[08:03.080 --> 08:07.620]  If there is a gap where air can get in or out, that is a spot for aroma to essentially
[08:07.620 --> 08:12.340]  get sucked right into that and blown right out of your grow space that did not get filtered.
[08:12.340 --> 08:17.860]  We want any air that enters that tube, that exit path, to run through that filter at the
[08:17.860 --> 08:22.740]  beginning and have no chance of entering the grow room or collecting more air through
[08:22.740 --> 08:25.300]  gaps on the way down that tube.
[08:25.300 --> 08:30.620]  Then this listener also places another carbon filter, which I'm sure he's using more sealant
[08:30.620 --> 08:34.300]  on that joint as well, at the very end at his exit point.
[08:34.300 --> 08:38.500]  Now, if you don't have another carbon filter at that end, I highly recommend some sort
[08:38.500 --> 08:43.860]  of a screen, at least a pantyhose or some type of thin cover just to prevent anything
[08:43.860 --> 08:45.500]  from coming in your ductwork.
[08:45.500 --> 08:47.940]  I don't know how high off the ground your ductwork is.
[08:47.940 --> 08:52.340]  I don't know how low your ductwork is, but I have seen weird shit happen with ductwork
[08:52.340 --> 08:53.340]  that was not covered.
[08:53.340 --> 08:56.260]  I have seen birds fly into ductwork that was up high.
[08:56.260 --> 08:59.860]  I have seen snakes and reptiles climb into ductwork that was down low.
[08:59.860 --> 09:03.100]  I've walked into a grow room before that's got sealed lights and there was a snake just
[09:03.100 --> 09:06.660]  chilling in the grow hood because it was warm as fuck and that snake was loving life right
[09:06.660 --> 09:07.660]  there.
[09:07.660 --> 09:10.620]  He just climbed right down the ducting, climbed into the light hood and just chilled out like,
[09:10.620 --> 09:12.140]  hey, this is beautiful here.
[09:12.140 --> 09:15.220]  It was a pain in the ass to get him out because we had to undo all the ducting just to get
[09:15.940 --> 09:16.940]  to him.
[09:16.940 --> 09:18.740]  Then some asshole had to reach in there and get a snake out.
[09:18.740 --> 09:20.100]  Don't put yourself in that position.
[09:20.100 --> 09:21.780]  You don't want a snake in your grow room.
[09:21.780 --> 09:23.740]  You don't want a reptile in your grow room.
[09:23.740 --> 09:25.660]  Make sure you seal the end of that ducting.
[09:25.660 --> 09:27.220]  Also, insects like to come up there.
[09:27.220 --> 09:28.220]  It's nice and warm.
[09:28.220 --> 09:29.420]  They feel that warm air coming out.
[09:29.420 --> 09:30.420]  They think it's warm.
[09:30.420 --> 09:31.700]  It's got to be nice in there.
[09:31.700 --> 09:33.260]  It's probably the sun setting.
[09:33.260 --> 09:34.260]  It's getting colder outside.
[09:34.260 --> 09:37.020]  They're like, look, there's still sun in there and they want to go in there and find some
[09:37.020 --> 09:39.260]  food or maybe find something to mate with.
[09:39.260 --> 09:40.780]  They want to go where the warm is.
[09:40.780 --> 09:41.780]  Don't invite them.
[09:41.780 --> 09:42.780]  Cover that shit up.
[09:42.900 --> 09:47.020]  Also, if you are using one of those portable air conditioners that has the ducting in and
[09:47.020 --> 09:50.660]  the ducting out, cover the ducting on that with something.
[09:50.660 --> 09:54.540]  But make sure you use something that does not restrict the airflow because you will
[09:54.540 --> 09:56.180]  ruin that air conditioner.
[09:56.180 --> 10:00.060]  It needs to be covered with something that allows airflow but will not allow pests to
[10:00.060 --> 10:01.060]  come in or out.
[10:01.060 --> 10:04.500]  A very thin screen, something with a very fine micron mesh.
[10:04.500 --> 10:06.740]  I like to use those HIPAA filters.
[10:06.740 --> 10:08.120]  They sell them in many different sizes.
[10:08.120 --> 10:11.460]  You can cut them to size and then you can just use a staple gun to staple them right
[10:11.460 --> 10:12.460]  wherever you need them.
[10:13.140 --> 10:15.020]  I like to put a little duct tape over the edge so it stops fraying.
[10:15.020 --> 10:16.940]  But make sure you cover all your ins and outs.
[10:16.940 --> 10:18.220]  We don't need bugs coming in.
[10:18.220 --> 10:20.340]  We don't need bugs climbing on our plants.
[10:20.340 --> 10:23.580]  And we certainly don't want some sort of reptiles in our grow room.
[10:23.580 --> 10:24.580]  I don't know.
[10:24.580 --> 10:25.580]  Maybe you do.
[10:25.580 --> 10:27.780]  But if you do want a reptile in there, you probably brought it in there already.
[10:27.780 --> 10:30.620]  You don't want it just showing up on fucking surprise.
[10:30.620 --> 10:31.620]  That's going to freak you out.
[10:31.620 --> 10:32.620]  So cover up your shit.
[10:32.620 --> 10:33.620]  Be careful.
[10:33.620 --> 10:37.620]  But the point is, make sure to not let any aroma escape that grow room.
[10:37.780 --> 10:42.340]  So on all of the stuff I talked about on the previous episode, replace all of those seals
[10:42.340 --> 10:45.660]  with some type of sealant or some type of caulking.
[10:45.660 --> 10:49.900]  This person recommends rope caulk and he says you can get it at any hardware store.
[10:49.900 --> 10:52.240]  I would put a nice solid layer of rope caulk.
[10:52.240 --> 10:57.500]  Then I would also cover it with duct tape just because I've got some solid OCD.
[10:57.500 --> 10:59.260]  Now there is a little bit more to this message.
[10:59.260 --> 11:04.460]  It says, personally, I like this setup because if one filter starts to fail, the other will
[11:04.460 --> 11:07.980]  help to minimize the odor until I can fix the problem.
[11:07.980 --> 11:11.140]  Hey man, I like the mindfulness and I like the forethought.
[11:11.140 --> 11:12.140]  Great thinking.
[11:12.140 --> 11:15.420]  It goes on to say, I have not experienced any negatives to running two filters.
[11:15.420 --> 11:16.940]  No, I don't think you will.
[11:16.940 --> 11:20.380]  As long as your blower is able to handle it, that'll be a fucking good idea.
[11:20.380 --> 11:24.020]  Then it says safe, discreet, and odorless has no price tag.
[11:24.020 --> 11:25.700]  That is the truth.
[11:25.700 --> 11:30.500]  That extra carbon filter, that stronger blower is way more affordable than a lawyer, way
[11:30.500 --> 11:34.900]  more affordable than bail, and way more affordable than having a felony on your record for the
[11:34.900 --> 11:35.900]  rest of your life.
[11:35.900 --> 11:39.440]  So buy that extra carbon filter and do the extra work.
[11:39.440 --> 11:42.780]  He wraps up the message with, made sure to hug my mom on mom's day.
[11:42.780 --> 11:44.820]  And then he signed it with the milkman.
[11:44.820 --> 11:49.140]  Hey milkman, thank you for the great message and thank you for the great contribution to
[11:49.140 --> 11:50.140]  the podcast.
[11:50.140 --> 11:53.620]  I do appreciate updates and information like that.
[11:53.620 --> 11:59.420]  And again, if anybody out there would like to send me an email, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[11:59.420 --> 12:03.060]  I would love any sort of corrections, updates, or contributions.
[12:03.060 --> 12:05.980]  All right, I've got one more email in front of me.
[12:05.980 --> 12:07.780]  Then we're going to get to the YouTube comments.
[12:07.780 --> 12:09.940]  I've never read YouTube comments before on the show.
[12:09.940 --> 12:11.960]  We're going to start that on this episode.
[12:11.960 --> 12:13.860]  This email goes like this.
[12:13.860 --> 12:17.620]  It says, hey, I can't thank you enough for the incredible content and knowledge that
[12:17.620 --> 12:18.620]  you share.
[12:18.620 --> 12:20.320]  That's a great way to start a message.
[12:20.320 --> 12:23.740]  It goes on to say, I learn something each and every time that I listen to one of your
[12:23.740 --> 12:25.540]  shows and that is the point.
[12:25.540 --> 12:26.540]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[12:26.540 --> 12:29.460]  It makes me feel good knowing that I'm reaching my goal.
[12:29.460 --> 12:32.460]  It goes on to say, I've recently started my first grow.
[12:32.460 --> 12:35.180]  It's turned into a slightly controlled disaster.
[12:35.180 --> 12:37.340]  That's oftentimes how first grows go.
[12:37.340 --> 12:42.140]  He says, but finding your show and documenting my grow gave me a lot of great knowledge that
[12:42.140 --> 12:45.660]  I can take forward to make the next one more successful.
[12:45.660 --> 12:46.980]  That is the perfect attitude.
[12:46.980 --> 12:49.020]  You learned how to fuck up a grow.
[12:49.020 --> 12:50.820]  Now you can learn how not to fuck up a grow.
[12:50.820 --> 12:51.900]  You got to start somewhere, man.
[12:51.900 --> 12:53.660]  So you've got the great attitude.
[12:53.660 --> 12:55.340]  You were on the right path.
[12:55.340 --> 13:00.260]  It goes on to say, I recently signed up for the $4.20 level on Patreon.
[13:00.260 --> 13:04.860]  If you're going to shout me out, use Darren W. That would be appreciated.
[13:04.860 --> 13:08.940]  I'm in a legal country, but my work would likely frown upon my grow interest, whether
[13:08.940 --> 13:10.500]  it's legal or not.
[13:10.500 --> 13:12.620]  All right, Darren, I will keep you safe, bro.
[13:12.620 --> 13:16.140]  Big shout out to my buddy, Darren W. Thanks for the Patreon contribution.
[13:16.140 --> 13:17.460]  Also, thanks for the great email.
[13:17.460 --> 13:22.560]  I do appreciate hearing that I am helping people out and that I improved your grow just
[13:22.560 --> 13:26.720]  by hearing my show and taking some of the stuff that I rambled into a microphone.
[13:26.720 --> 13:30.520]  You were able to improve your garden, which means your life is better, which means if
[13:30.520 --> 13:34.720]  you're smoking recreationally or medicinally, you are improving the quality of your life.
[13:34.720 --> 13:36.400]  So that makes me feel good to hear.
[13:36.400 --> 13:37.880]  So thank you for the great message.
[13:37.880 --> 13:38.880]  He wraps it up.
[13:38.880 --> 13:40.000]  It says, keep up the great work.
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.280]  I always look forward to listening and learning from you.
[13:43.280 --> 13:48.040]  Thanks Darren W. Hey man, thank you for the great message once again.
[13:48.040 --> 13:50.240]  And thanks again for the Patreon contribution.
[13:50.240 --> 13:51.640]  I really appreciate that.
[13:51.960 --> 13:54.720]  All right, Podcast World, I'm going to press pause for a moment.
[13:54.720 --> 13:55.840]  I'm going to take a drink.
[13:55.840 --> 13:59.680]  I'm going to take way too many, way too big, way too hot dabs.
[13:59.680 --> 14:04.220]  And right after that, I'll come back and read a couple of comments from my YouTube channel.
[14:04.220 --> 14:05.640]  Take a dab with me, boys and girls.
[14:07.480 --> 14:09.080]  All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[14:09.080 --> 14:10.200]  I am well hydrated.
[14:10.200 --> 14:11.640]  I am heavily medicated.
[14:11.640 --> 14:14.880]  And it is time to read some comments from the YouTube channel.
[14:14.880 --> 14:16.840]  I'm clicking that direction right now.
[14:16.840 --> 14:20.100]  I want to give a big thanks to everybody who has subscribed to my YouTube channel.
[14:20.100 --> 14:23.460]  If you go to YouTube, type in the Grow From Your Heart Podcast, you will find my YouTube
[14:23.460 --> 14:24.460]  channel.
[14:24.460 --> 14:26.660]  Please click subscribe, leave some comments.
[14:26.660 --> 14:29.940]  Maybe I will read your comments on a future episode.
[14:29.940 --> 14:33.660]  The first comment on today's episode comes from somebody who calls themselves Killer
[14:33.660 --> 14:34.660]  B's Garden.
[14:34.660 --> 14:36.700]  They left this comment six days ago.
[14:36.700 --> 14:38.940]  The comment goes a lot like this.
[14:38.940 --> 14:39.940]  You're the man, RJ.
[14:39.940 --> 14:41.980]  And RJ stands for Rusty Jeff.
[14:41.980 --> 14:43.980]  He says, you help so many.
[14:43.980 --> 14:48.220]  I was the same way in school, but the way you teach is super engaging.
[14:48.340 --> 14:52.940]  What he's referring to is in an episode, I said that I hated school, but I love to learn.
[14:52.940 --> 14:55.700]  So I had to find a way to entertain myself while I was learning.
[14:55.700 --> 14:57.820]  So he agrees he was the same way.
[14:57.820 --> 14:59.880]  But the way that I teach is super engaging.
[14:59.880 --> 15:00.880]  That means a lot to me.
[15:00.880 --> 15:01.880]  Thank you.
[15:01.880 --> 15:05.260]  It goes on to say, thank you for all of your efforts and a huge thank you for all of the
[15:05.260 --> 15:06.260]  awesome genetics.
[15:06.260 --> 15:08.100]  Dude, you're so welcome.
[15:08.100 --> 15:09.860]  Those compliments mean a lot to me.
[15:09.860 --> 15:11.340]  So that makes it all worth it.
[15:11.340 --> 15:15.820]  All the hard work, all the late nights podcasting, all the frustration, all the research, all
[15:15.820 --> 15:18.120]  the writing, all the time, all the energy.
[15:18.120 --> 15:19.540]  This makes it worth it right here.
[15:19.540 --> 15:23.440]  It goes on to say, I've popped many beans, but all have been bag seeds.
[15:23.440 --> 15:28.640]  So I finally got my hands on some legit beans and man, everyone is right when they say genetics
[15:28.640 --> 15:30.520]  are the most important part.
[15:30.520 --> 15:33.200]  And yeah, I definitely can agree with that.
[15:33.200 --> 15:35.800]  After this grow, I'm on at the moment.
[15:35.800 --> 15:36.800]  Keep it up.
[15:36.800 --> 15:41.240]  Man, I'm glad you finally got some quality genetics and I'm sure you're going to see
[15:41.240 --> 15:43.760]  a huge difference in vigor and performance.
[15:43.760 --> 15:47.640]  And also just knowing what you've got, what you're working with will make the grow so
[15:47.640 --> 15:49.980]  much easier and so much more enjoyable.
[15:49.980 --> 15:54.280]  So I hope you enjoy the new genetics and I hope those come out beautifully for you.
[15:54.280 --> 15:56.520]  And I also hope to see photos.
[15:56.520 --> 15:57.720]  Send me some pictures of the grow.
[15:57.720 --> 15:59.800]  And if you've got any questions, let me know.
[15:59.800 --> 16:02.360]  Hey, Killer Bees, thank you for the great comment.
[16:02.360 --> 16:04.280]  We're going to move on to the next comment.
[16:04.280 --> 16:07.560]  This one was left by somebody who called themselves Smoke Why.
[16:07.560 --> 16:10.580]  Maybe they want to be called Smokey because I know why to smoke.
[16:10.580 --> 16:13.280]  Their comment goes a lot like this.
[16:13.280 --> 16:14.320]  Amazing show once again.
[16:14.320 --> 16:20.280]  I've been listening to your podcast on Stitcher since 2015, maybe 2014.
[16:20.280 --> 16:21.280]  That's a long time.
[16:21.280 --> 16:22.440]  You've been there since the beginning.
[16:22.440 --> 16:23.440]  Thank you, man.
[16:23.440 --> 16:24.440]  I appreciate that.
[16:24.440 --> 16:29.040]  The message goes, I don't remember what year you started, but I've been listening forever.
[16:29.040 --> 16:30.340]  Thanks for all of the help.
[16:30.340 --> 16:31.880]  You have been a big help.
[16:31.880 --> 16:33.880]  Hey, thank you for the great comment.
[16:33.880 --> 16:34.880]  Thank you for listening.
[16:34.880 --> 16:38.120]  And if you ever have any questions, please send them to my email.
[16:38.120 --> 16:39.120]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[16:39.120 --> 16:44.280]  We're going to keep going because there are some great comments in here.
[16:44.280 --> 16:46.720]  Our friend You Grow says, love the show, man.
[16:46.720 --> 16:50.160]  I always get my seeds from Seeds Here Now.
[16:50.160 --> 16:51.240]  Thanks for listening to the show.
[16:51.240 --> 16:55.280]  And of course, thanks for supporting our sponsor, Seeds Here Now.
[16:55.280 --> 16:59.240]  Jesse James said, I'd love to hear what genetics you bring back from Europe.
[16:59.240 --> 17:03.320]  That is referring to one of our friends who invited me to Europe to go hang out on a vacation.
[17:03.320 --> 17:08.200]  Dude, I would love to see what kind of genetics I brought back from Europe also.
[17:08.200 --> 17:11.160]  If that happens, you'll be the second one to know.
[17:11.160 --> 17:13.000]  I've got another comment from Bill Parks.
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.520]  It says, great podcast, dude.
[17:15.520 --> 17:16.520]  Very informative.
[17:16.520 --> 17:17.520]  Thank you.
[17:17.520 --> 17:19.120]  Hey, Bill Parks, you're very welcome.
[17:19.120 --> 17:20.560]  Thanks for the great comment.
[17:20.560 --> 17:21.560]  It keeps going.
[17:21.560 --> 17:25.360]  That one just says, arise, arise, arise.
[17:25.360 --> 17:26.720]  That's a great comment.
[17:26.720 --> 17:28.080]  This one from Stoney Scholar.
[17:28.080 --> 17:29.680]  What's up to our friend Stoney Scholar?
[17:29.680 --> 17:32.640]  Stoney Scholar says, another great listen in the garden.
[17:32.640 --> 17:33.760]  I appreciate that.
[17:33.760 --> 17:35.800]  I think a lot of people listen while they're growing.
[17:35.800 --> 17:38.320]  I know that I listen to the Dude Grow Show while I'm in the garden.
[17:38.320 --> 17:42.520]  It just feels right to be around the plants and listening to a show focused on plants.
[17:43.040 --> 17:44.040]  Thanks for listening in the garden.
[17:44.040 --> 17:48.240]  Yo, Stoney Scholar, I look forward to seeing you at the DGC event.
[17:48.240 --> 17:49.240]  Bring some diamonds.
[17:49.240 --> 17:50.840]  I'll take a dab.
[17:50.840 --> 17:53.280]  We've got another great comment from our friend Tristan Hawk.
[17:53.280 --> 17:57.720]  This one was left a week ago and it says, I wanted to drop in and say hello and thanks
[17:57.720 --> 18:03.080]  from a fellow new listener, YouTube subscriber and say, I have been producing my own medicinal
[18:03.080 --> 18:04.800]  cannabis for 12 years.
[18:04.800 --> 18:08.120]  I decided to take it a step further by getting my plant science degree.
[18:08.120 --> 18:09.320]  Hey, congratulations, dude.
[18:09.320 --> 18:14.480]  To have the paperwork to jump on the legalization train for micro cultivation here in Canada.
[18:14.480 --> 18:17.080]  Man, I hope that that's working out for you.
[18:17.080 --> 18:19.240]  It says one more year to go.
[18:19.240 --> 18:20.240]  One more year, bro.
[18:20.240 --> 18:21.240]  Good luck.
[18:21.240 --> 18:22.240]  He says great stuff.
[18:22.240 --> 18:26.480]  Well informed and also well balanced between botanical knowledge yet making it simpler
[18:26.480 --> 18:28.600]  for new growers to comprehend.
[18:28.600 --> 18:29.680]  Keep it up.
[18:29.680 --> 18:34.120]  This guy's been growing for 12 years and he is getting a plant science degree and he is
[18:34.120 --> 18:36.280]  learning from this little podcast.
[18:36.280 --> 18:37.280]  That means a lot to me.
[18:37.280 --> 18:40.920]  I am teaching people who are going to school for plant science degrees.
[18:40.920 --> 18:42.200]  That makes me proud.
[18:42.200 --> 18:44.000]  That lets me know that I'm really doing a good service.
[18:44.000 --> 18:45.000]  So thank you.
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.520]  That is a great message and good luck in school, man.
[18:46.520 --> 18:47.520]  Keep going.
[18:47.520 --> 18:48.520]  I know school can be a struggle.
[18:48.520 --> 18:50.120]  I did not enjoy school.
[18:50.120 --> 18:51.800]  Like I said earlier, I love learning.
[18:51.800 --> 18:54.120]  School was just not the environment for me.
[18:54.120 --> 18:55.280]  There are more great comments.
[18:55.280 --> 18:59.760]  This one says, hey, Rasta Jeff, just curious about your thoughts on using a sorbic acid
[18:59.760 --> 19:03.120]  to neutralize chloramine in tap water.
[19:03.120 --> 19:07.080]  That may be effective in a small grow, but now you've got a sorbic acid in your water.
[19:07.880 --> 19:09.400]  I think your pH is going to be a little bit out of whack.
[19:09.400 --> 19:14.360]  I think RO filtration may be the best, if not the only way to effectively get that out
[19:14.360 --> 19:17.360]  for commercial production.
[19:17.360 --> 19:19.760]  Our next comment was left by our friend Craft Cannabis.
[19:19.760 --> 19:22.520]  It says, another fantastic show Rasta Jeff.
[19:22.520 --> 19:23.520]  Thanks my friend.
[19:23.520 --> 19:24.520]  Stay lifted.
[19:24.520 --> 19:25.600]  I promise you I will.
[19:25.600 --> 19:27.040]  Thanks for the great compliments.
[19:27.040 --> 19:28.880]  Miss Mel says, thank you for the shout out.
[19:28.880 --> 19:30.440]  You are very welcome Mel.
[19:30.440 --> 19:32.980]  It's always great to hang out, talk to you.
[19:32.980 --> 19:36.360]  Our next one says, yo Ross, you best stay away from my mom.
[19:36.360 --> 19:37.360]  I love that comment.
[19:37.360 --> 19:38.520]  That is fucking hilarious to me.
[19:38.520 --> 19:39.760]  And then it says, just kidding.
[19:39.760 --> 19:41.280]  She wants a hug directly from you.
[19:41.280 --> 19:43.360]  That one was left by our friend Mike Jones.
[19:43.360 --> 19:44.360]  Who?
[19:44.360 --> 19:45.360]  Mike Jones.
[19:45.360 --> 19:47.200]  Hey Mike Jones, when I see your mom, I got a big old hug for her.
[19:47.200 --> 19:48.520]  Don't worry bro.
[19:48.520 --> 19:49.680]  We've got more great comments.
[19:49.680 --> 19:53.240]  This one says, I've bought Irie Genetics from Oregon Elite and Hella Dank.
[19:53.240 --> 19:56.500]  Both have good service, but Oregon Elite has freebies.
[19:56.500 --> 19:59.080]  Now Hella Dank has freebies also.
[19:59.080 --> 20:00.080]  Have no fear.
[20:00.080 --> 20:01.160]  Get your gear.
[20:01.160 --> 20:02.160]  I've never said that before.
[20:02.160 --> 20:03.160]  That's catchy.
[20:03.160 --> 20:04.160]  I'm going to keep saying that.
[20:04.240 --> 20:08.600]  The next comment is from somebody who calls themselves The Links Grows and Shows.
[20:08.600 --> 20:09.600]  That's a cool name.
[20:09.600 --> 20:13.360]  It says, is Bebop the same cross as Blue Raspberry Truffle?
[20:13.360 --> 20:16.520]  No, it is the exact opposite.
[20:16.520 --> 20:19.600]  Bebop is a rise crossed to blueberry cookies.
[20:19.600 --> 20:23.560]  The male was the reverse blueberry cookies and the seeds are feminized.
[20:23.560 --> 20:28.620]  The Blue Raspberry Truffle, the male was the arise and those seeds are regular.
[20:28.620 --> 20:30.080]  So it is the exact opposite.
[20:30.080 --> 20:33.040]  I hope I said that correctly because I don't have any notes in front of me and I tried
[20:33.040 --> 20:35.640]  to keep all that shit straight, but I think you guys know what I mean.
[20:35.640 --> 20:38.120]  They are opposites.
[20:38.120 --> 20:39.800]  The comments keep coming, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:39.800 --> 20:41.080]  This one says, thanks for sharing.
[20:41.080 --> 20:42.080]  Have a beautiful day.
[20:42.080 --> 20:43.320]  Hey, thank you for listening.
[20:43.320 --> 20:44.740]  Take a fat dab.
[20:44.740 --> 20:45.920]  This one says, great content.
[20:45.920 --> 20:47.940]  I love how you lay it all out there.
[20:47.940 --> 20:48.940]  Thank you.
[20:48.940 --> 20:52.200]  I'm glad you noticed that I try to put as much out there as I can without overwhelming
[20:52.200 --> 20:53.200]  you.
[20:53.200 --> 20:55.460]  I want to make it clear, but I don't want it to be too much.
[20:55.460 --> 20:57.680]  So I try to find that line.
[20:57.680 --> 21:00.300]  The next one says, always the best advice from Ross to Jeff.
[21:00.300 --> 21:01.360]  That means a lot to me.
[21:01.360 --> 21:02.600]  Thank you.
[21:02.600 --> 21:03.600]  There are more.
[21:03.600 --> 21:05.360]  Let's find a couple more, then we're going to get out of here.
[21:05.360 --> 21:06.520]  Love the podcast, brother.
[21:06.520 --> 21:07.520]  Keep them coming.
[21:07.520 --> 21:08.600]  On point as always.
[21:08.600 --> 21:12.280]  With love from Canada A. A big shout out to all my friends in Canada.
[21:12.280 --> 21:17.200]  I've noticed that recently I've gotten a large following of people from Canada.
[21:17.200 --> 21:18.200]  Thank you.
[21:18.200 --> 21:19.200]  I appreciate that.
[21:19.200 --> 21:20.200]  Thanks for following me up there.
[21:20.200 --> 21:21.760]  If you guys have any questions, send them on to me.
[21:21.760 --> 21:23.900]  I love helping out my friends to the north.
[21:23.900 --> 21:26.760]  The next comment is a compliment about the Helladank Seed Company.
[21:26.760 --> 21:30.760]  It says, just received some of your genetics from HDSC in two days.
[21:30.760 --> 21:32.480]  Very fast, very friendly.
[21:32.480 --> 21:34.960]  Can't wait to get these in the ground.
[21:34.960 --> 21:35.960]  That is awesome.
[21:35.960 --> 21:39.440]  It's always good to hear that my sponsors and my vendors are working correctly and they're
[21:39.440 --> 21:40.440]  doing things properly.
[21:40.440 --> 21:43.000]  So that's a great compliment to them.
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.160]  Then there's a comment here on the episode I did about mushrooms in Denver.
[21:46.160 --> 21:47.880]  It says, you can take too many.
[21:47.880 --> 21:49.600]  I ate about an ounce one night.
[21:49.600 --> 21:51.240]  Well, yeah, that is too many.
[21:51.240 --> 21:53.160]  That may be too many for a lot of people.
[21:53.160 --> 21:56.400]  Went into seizures and started vomiting profusely.
[21:56.400 --> 21:59.520]  Obviously lived and was fine, but the rest of that night sucked dick.
[21:59.520 --> 22:01.360]  Yeah, that sounds like a miserable experience.
[22:01.360 --> 22:03.360]  That comes from our friend AB.
[22:03.360 --> 22:06.840]  My advice there, don't eat a goddamn ounce of mushrooms.
[22:06.840 --> 22:07.960]  I'm a soldier.
[22:07.960 --> 22:09.800]  I like a spiritual experience.
[22:09.800 --> 22:11.120]  I like to go heroic.
[22:11.120 --> 22:15.120]  An ounce of mushrooms just sounds like a bad idea.
[22:15.120 --> 22:16.800]  The next comment says, good show.
[22:16.800 --> 22:17.800]  Thank you.
[22:17.800 --> 22:18.800]  Good comment.
[22:18.800 --> 22:20.760]  I see Stony Scholar's name pop up in here a lot.
[22:20.760 --> 22:22.520]  Shout out to Stony Scholar.
[22:22.520 --> 22:25.560]  The next comment says, I love your show and all of your shows.
[22:25.560 --> 22:26.560]  Big thank you for that one.
[22:26.560 --> 22:27.560]  That means a lot.
[22:27.560 --> 22:29.600]  It looks like I need to give a big shout out to my buddy CJ.
[22:29.600 --> 22:30.600]  What's up CJ?
[22:30.600 --> 22:33.600]  If you're listening to the podcast, I see you pop up in the YouTube comments a lot.
[22:33.600 --> 22:37.760]  He just leaves a couple emojis, some flowers, some smiley faces, some thumbs up.
[22:37.760 --> 22:38.760]  What's up buddy?
[22:38.760 --> 22:39.760]  I see you out there.
[22:39.760 --> 22:40.760]  CJ is a great guy.
[22:40.760 --> 22:41.760]  Met him at the Indo Expo.
[22:41.760 --> 22:43.440]  We've been talking a little bit online.
[22:43.440 --> 22:44.440]  We're going to hang out, buddy.
[22:44.440 --> 22:45.440]  Don't worry.
[22:45.440 --> 22:46.440]  We'll take some dabs sometime soon.
[22:46.440 --> 22:48.360]  We are too like-minded to not become good friends.
[22:48.360 --> 22:50.680]  Also, I see James Butterson on here a lot.
[22:50.680 --> 22:51.680]  What's up James?
[22:51.680 --> 22:55.000]  You are always the first one to comment on all of the videos.
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.080]  Big love, much respect to James Butterson.
[22:57.080 --> 22:58.400]  We got a comment from Buzzbro.
[22:58.400 --> 23:01.880]  It says, thank you very much for taking the time to answer my question.
[23:01.880 --> 23:05.260]  I had to drop a line and let you know how the dark period worked out for me.
[23:05.260 --> 23:08.920]  The buds plumped up and the trichomes multiplied.
[23:08.920 --> 23:12.680]  That means a lot to me that my advice is working.
[23:12.680 --> 23:17.000]  The next comment is in reference to an episode I did right around the time we lost my friend
[23:17.000 --> 23:18.000]  Brody Stevens.
[23:18.000 --> 23:19.720]  It says, this one was a trip to listen to.
[23:19.720 --> 23:21.360]  I'm a big comedy fan.
[23:21.360 --> 23:22.360]  What a lineup.
[23:22.360 --> 23:24.560]  So much has gone down with all these folks.
[23:24.560 --> 23:26.600]  Rest in peace, Brody Stevens.
[23:26.600 --> 23:31.240]  Yes, big love to Brody and big shout out to Blackbird for the great comment.
[23:31.240 --> 23:32.400]  And then we're going to start wrapping it up.
[23:32.400 --> 23:33.400]  We've got a couple more.
[23:33.400 --> 23:37.820]  This one says, big growers love to Rasta Jeff and all of my fellow canna heads.
[23:37.820 --> 23:40.340]  Big shout out to Kraft Cannabis for the great comment.
[23:40.340 --> 23:44.320]  Big shout out to all of my fellow canna heads and big growers love to Kraft Cannabis.
[23:44.320 --> 23:49.720]  Our last one for this episode comes from T Bean and it says, what is your Cannabuzz channel
[23:49.720 --> 23:50.720]  name?
[23:50.720 --> 23:51.720]  That's a great question.
[23:51.720 --> 23:55.160]  On Cannabuzz, I use irie underscore genetics.

[24:43.780 --> 24:49.440]  the opportunity to pitch my new favorite social media application called Cannabuzz.
[24:49.440 --> 24:53.040]  You guys, that looks like that is all of the comments I'm going to read for today.
[24:53.040 --> 24:54.960]  This one actually says, fucking dig it.
[24:54.960 --> 24:58.000]  Super accessible knowledge and really helped me rethink my newts.
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.160]  That kind of stuff means a lot to me.
[24:59.160 --> 25:01.080]  That one comes from our friend El Pinche.
