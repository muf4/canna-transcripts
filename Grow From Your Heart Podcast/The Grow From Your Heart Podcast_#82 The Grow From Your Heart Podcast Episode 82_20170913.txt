[00:17.340 --> 00:19.740]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[00:19.740 --> 00:22.660]  It's time for episode number 82 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[00:25.660 --> 00:30.020]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a news smoker
[00:30.020 --> 00:33.580]  or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:33.580 --> 00:37.620]  about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.620 --> 00:39.420]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.420 --> 00:41.340]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:41.340 --> 00:44.420]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for letting
[00:44.420 --> 00:46.060]  me play their song on the show.
[00:46.060 --> 00:49.140]  Big thanks to Cat Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:49.140 --> 00:50.140]  What's up, everybody?
[00:50.140 --> 00:52.660]  I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[00:52.660 --> 00:56.940]  Got a lot of news to talk about, but before we get too far, got to pay the bills.

[02:01.620 --> 02:04.900]  So I hope everybody had a safe 4th of July weekend.
[02:04.900 --> 02:06.660]  I hope you had a bunch of good fun.
[02:06.660 --> 02:07.660]  Hope you had a safe weekend.
[02:07.660 --> 02:08.980]  Hope nobody lost any fingers.
[02:09.300 --> 02:11.060]  Hope nobody got too drunk.
[02:11.060 --> 02:13.380]  Hope nobody had a major hangover.
[02:13.380 --> 02:14.380]  I hope nothing went wrong.
[02:14.380 --> 02:16.020]  I hope everything went well for you.
[02:16.020 --> 02:17.020]  All right.
[02:17.020 --> 02:19.540]  So, on the 5th of July, I'm going to brag a little bit.
[02:19.540 --> 02:21.180]  I got to see who else?
[02:21.180 --> 02:22.180]  Who would you guess?
[02:22.180 --> 02:23.180]  Right?
[02:23.180 --> 02:24.180]  You know me.
[02:24.180 --> 02:25.500]  I got to see Mr. Doug Benson at Comedy Works in Denver.
[02:25.500 --> 02:26.500]  Doug was in town.
[02:26.500 --> 02:31.100]  He did another stand-up comedy show, and I got to tell you, he really redeemed himself
[02:31.100 --> 02:33.220]  from the last show that I saw.
[02:33.220 --> 02:38.100]  If you listen to this podcast regularly, you know that I kind of bashed Doug Benson's last
[02:38.220 --> 02:43.300]  performance at Comedy Works, and I also kind of bashed his album.
[02:43.300 --> 02:45.100]  He did a much better performance this time.
[02:45.100 --> 02:48.540]  He had a little bit of a cough, which may have worked to our advantage.
[02:48.540 --> 02:51.780]  Doug wasn't smoking as heavily because he was a little bit under the weather, and I
[02:51.780 --> 02:56.420]  think it led to him having a better performance.
[02:56.420 --> 02:58.220]  Doug did make a comment.
[02:58.220 --> 03:03.300]  Actually, Doug walked out on stage, and the first thing Doug said was, hey, you know it's
[03:03.300 --> 03:05.900]  a Doug Benson show because Rasta Jeff is here.
[03:05.900 --> 03:07.900]  And of course, I was sitting right in the front row.
[03:08.700 --> 03:10.140]  I've got those two VIP seats always.
[03:10.140 --> 03:11.540]  So that was kind of neat.
[03:11.540 --> 03:15.300]  But then he started talking a little bit, and he pulled out a handful of notes.
[03:15.300 --> 03:18.420]  And he said, well, I got my jokes here in my pocket, and he looked me straight in the
[03:18.420 --> 03:22.940]  face and he said, Rasta Jeff knows what I'm talking about.
[03:22.940 --> 03:27.220]  If you guys listen to this podcast, I called Doug out on his pocket full of disheveled
[03:27.220 --> 03:29.060]  notes on another episode.
[03:29.060 --> 03:32.100]  I am wondering if Doug listens to the podcast.
[03:32.100 --> 03:35.940]  I'm not sure, but Doug, if you're listening, dude, great show.
[03:35.940 --> 03:36.940]  Thanks for a great time.
[03:36.980 --> 03:38.740]  I hope you're getting over that cough.
[03:38.740 --> 03:42.020]  And I've been watching your Periscope videos, and they're great.
[03:42.020 --> 03:46.580]  Also at Comedy Works that weekend, or the same day, opening for Doug Benson was my friend
[03:46.580 --> 03:47.660]  Ngaio Bilem.
[03:47.660 --> 03:50.220]  If you don't know Ngaio Bilem, make sure you check him out.
[03:50.220 --> 03:53.060]  His name is spelled N-G-A-I-O.
[03:53.060 --> 03:55.620]  It's at Ngaio420 on Twitter.
[03:55.620 --> 03:57.140]  Make sure you search him out and follow him.
[03:57.140 --> 03:58.540]  He's a really good dude.
[03:58.540 --> 03:59.540]  Had a lot of fun.
[03:59.540 --> 04:03.780]  He's a cannabis connoisseur like myself, so we have a lot of things to talk about.
[04:03.900 --> 04:07.380]  We may hint at a future collaboration between the two of us.
[04:07.380 --> 04:10.300]  We'll talk too much about it, but there may be some stuff being talked about.
[04:10.300 --> 04:11.300]  He does live in California.
[04:11.300 --> 04:12.300]  I live in Colorado.
[04:12.300 --> 04:18.700]  There are a lot of things to deal with there, but we are going to try and do some shit together.
[04:18.700 --> 04:20.340]  I got to say, Ngaio crushed.
[04:20.340 --> 04:24.300]  Ngaio did probably 20 minutes, maybe 30.
[04:24.300 --> 04:27.580]  It seemed like he went on for a long time, but he definitely tore it up.
[04:27.580 --> 04:31.140]  Had to be 15 or 20 minutes, because I'm sure he didn't do more than that being an opening
[04:31.140 --> 04:32.140]  act.
[04:32.140 --> 04:33.140]  But he was on fire.
[04:33.500 --> 04:35.700]  He made me laugh my ass off.
[04:35.700 --> 04:41.220]  Doug Benson was equally hilarious, but I've seen Doug so many times that when he starts
[04:41.220 --> 04:46.780]  into a vibe, I know which jokes are coming out of this clump of ... This part of the
[04:46.780 --> 04:50.020]  show is going to be this clump of jokes, and then the vibe will change, because he's very
[04:50.020 --> 04:51.060]  interactive with the crowd.
[04:51.060 --> 04:52.700]  He does a lot of crowd work.
[04:52.700 --> 04:55.740]  But I know all of Doug's jokes, so it's a little predictable for me.
[04:55.740 --> 04:57.580]  I go for the fun.
[04:57.580 --> 05:01.980]  I go for the smoke session before and after, of course, because that's always a good time.
[05:01.980 --> 05:04.060]  Enough bragging about my weekend at Comedy Works.
[05:04.060 --> 05:06.500]  I owe a big shout out to Mr. Doug Benson, of course.
[05:06.500 --> 05:08.540]  A big shout out to Ngaio Bilam.
[05:08.540 --> 05:13.180]  A big, huge shout out to Comedy Works, the greatest comedy venue on the planet.
[05:13.180 --> 05:14.880]  Also a big shout out to my buddy, Baker.
[05:14.880 --> 05:16.860]  He always gets me the hookups at Comedy Works.
[05:16.860 --> 05:18.460]  He takes good care of me.
[05:18.460 --> 05:19.660]  Bro, big thanks.
[05:19.660 --> 05:22.620]  And also a big shout out to my beautiful date, Danielle.
[05:22.620 --> 05:24.380]  Thanks for being a wonderful date.
[05:24.380 --> 05:25.380]  You're not a pain in the ass.
[05:25.380 --> 05:26.380]  You're really easy to deal with.
[05:26.380 --> 05:27.380]  I had a lot of fun.
[05:27.380 --> 05:30.380]  I look forward to going to more comedy shows with you.
[05:31.140 --> 05:32.140]  All right.
[05:32.140 --> 05:36.620]  I might sneeze here in a minute, but we're just going to push on through until that happens.
[05:36.620 --> 05:38.180]  So I want to get into a little bit of news.
[05:38.180 --> 05:43.540]  I was, I woke up the other day and I got on the internet here and I see my buddy Giddy
[05:43.540 --> 05:45.900]  Up's face plastered all over the damn place.
[05:45.900 --> 05:49.820]  I want to give a huge shout out to Giddy Up and Too Short.
[05:49.820 --> 05:53.580]  We've been, if you guys follow the show, you've been hearing about the raid that happened
[05:53.580 --> 05:55.480]  in Santa Ana, California.
[05:55.480 --> 06:00.760]  The manager of that dispensary was in a wheelchair and she was blind and she has an amputated
[06:00.760 --> 06:01.760]  leg.
[06:01.760 --> 06:07.000]  She has been getting a lot of media coverage and recently it was discovered that her wheelchair
[06:07.000 --> 06:08.200]  was her electric wheelchair.
[06:08.200 --> 06:12.600]  It was kind of falling apart and it was held together mainly by duct tape.
[06:12.600 --> 06:18.440]  Well, there were a couple of people that thought that a lady in her position deserved better
[06:18.440 --> 06:20.460]  than a duct tape wheelchair.
[06:20.460 --> 06:26.540]  So Giddy Up from Emotech and Too Short got together and bought this lovely lady a brand
[06:26.540 --> 06:28.020]  new wheelchair.
[06:28.020 --> 06:32.920]  So I want to give a big, huge personal shout out to Giddy Up and to Too Short.
[06:32.920 --> 06:36.300]  That represents two industries that are always looked down upon.
[06:36.300 --> 06:39.940]  The rap industry is always looked at like a bunch of gangsters and the cannabis industry
[06:39.940 --> 06:41.620]  is looked at like a bunch of drug dealers.
[06:41.620 --> 06:45.180]  But look what two of our representatives did.
[06:45.180 --> 06:48.180]  From what I read, that wheelchair was about $4,000.
[06:48.180 --> 06:49.900]  That's not pocket change for anybody.
[06:49.900 --> 06:53.220]  So that's a good deed done by our industry.
[06:53.220 --> 06:54.500]  And big shout out to Giddy Up.
[06:54.500 --> 06:55.500]  Much respect to Giddy Up.
[06:55.500 --> 06:57.160]  I truly appreciate you.
[06:57.160 --> 06:58.160]  That's really cool.
[06:58.160 --> 07:01.980]  Giddy actually sent me my G-nail that I use and there's nothing like it.
[07:01.980 --> 07:04.580]  So do whatever you can to support Emotech.
[07:04.580 --> 07:05.580]  Send them a thank you.
[07:05.580 --> 07:06.580]  Something like that.
[07:06.580 --> 07:07.580]  All right.
[07:07.580 --> 07:09.220]  I've got another news article on the screen.
[07:09.220 --> 07:12.260]  I've got to decide which one I want to read first.
[07:12.260 --> 07:13.640]  They're both, let's see.
[07:13.640 --> 07:16.500]  Let's go to this one here.
[07:16.500 --> 07:17.500]  This one.
[07:17.500 --> 07:20.660]  I was just browsing through news sites and I came across this and I thought that the
[07:20.660 --> 07:22.380]  world would like to hear about this.
[07:22.380 --> 07:26.860]  The headline says, do medical marijuana users have right to bear arms?
[07:26.860 --> 07:29.420]  No says the ATF.
[07:29.420 --> 07:33.140]  And then it says there are no exceptions in federal law for marijuana purportedly used
[07:33.140 --> 07:36.700]  for medicinal purposes, ATF officials says.
[07:36.700 --> 07:40.500]  This article is by Matt Voltz and it's from the Associated Press.
[07:40.500 --> 07:41.660]  And it goes like this.
[07:41.660 --> 07:44.220]  It's from Helena, Montana.
[07:44.220 --> 07:48.360]  It says firearms dealers in states that allow medical marijuana can't sell guns or ammunition
[07:48.360 --> 07:50.340]  to registered users of the drug.
[07:50.340 --> 07:55.840]  A policy that marijuana and gun rights groups say denies second amendment rights to individuals
[07:55.840 --> 07:58.340]  who are following state law.
[07:58.340 --> 08:02.340]  Federal law already makes it illegal for someone to possess a gun if he or she is an unlawful
[08:02.340 --> 08:07.300]  user of or addicted to marijuana or other controlled substances.
[08:07.300 --> 08:11.780]  A September 21st letter from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives
[08:11.780 --> 08:17.140]  issued in response to numerous inquiries from gun dealers clarifies that medical marijuana
[08:17.140 --> 08:20.660]  patients are included in that definition.
[08:20.660 --> 08:25.820]  There are no exceptions in federal law for marijuana purportedly used for medicinal purposes,
[08:25.820 --> 08:30.780]  even if such use is sanctioned by state law, said the letter by Arthur Herbert, the ATF's
[08:30.780 --> 08:34.840]  assistant director for enforcement programs and services.
[08:34.840 --> 08:40.940]  Federal firearms licensees or FFLs can't sell a gun to someone who answers yes when requested
[08:41.020 --> 08:46.300]  forms ask whether the buyer is a controlled substance user.
[08:46.300 --> 08:49.420]  So that's kind of a tricky, that's bullshit right there.
[08:49.420 --> 08:51.460]  All right, I'm going to keep reading on.
[08:51.460 --> 08:52.740]  Reasonable cause to believe.
[08:52.740 --> 08:56.220]  This week's letter also says that licensed dealers can't sell a gun or ammunition if
[08:56.220 --> 09:00.620]  they have reasonable cause to believe the buyer is using a controlled substance.
[09:00.620 --> 09:04.580]  That includes if the buyer presents a medical marijuana card as identification or if the
[09:04.580 --> 09:09.340]  buyer talks about drug use, having a medical marijuana card or a recent drug conviction.
[09:09.340 --> 09:15.320]  ATF spokesman Drew Wade said Wednesday, but there are no new obligations for gun dealers
[09:15.320 --> 09:16.320]  outlined in the letter.
[09:16.320 --> 09:20.260]  Wade said we received lots of queries from the industry from various states of how to
[09:20.260 --> 09:22.500]  deal with the state legislation and federal law.
[09:22.500 --> 09:27.660]  He said it's our responsibility to provide guidance, advice and guidance.
[09:27.660 --> 09:31.960]  The clash between state and federal laws has led to lawsuits and criminal cases in some
[09:31.960 --> 09:36.260]  of the 16 states that have legalized medical marijuana use.
[09:36.260 --> 09:39.940]  Courts in two Oregon counties have said they'll appeal the US Supreme Court after state judges
[09:39.940 --> 09:44.740]  said sheriffs couldn't deny concealed handgun licenses for medical marijuana patients.
[09:44.740 --> 09:48.760]  The Oregon Court of Appeals and the Oregon Supreme Court said the state law authorizes
[09:48.760 --> 09:53.340]  concealed handgun permits and separate from the federal law that outlaws gun possession
[09:53.340 --> 09:58.020]  by drug users and the state gun law doesn't address medical marijuana use.
[09:58.020 --> 10:01.140]  Sorry, I'm reading ahead of myself here.
[10:01.140 --> 10:02.420]  The Montana raids.
[10:02.420 --> 10:06.820]  Federal authorities also raided dozens of medical marijuana operations across Montana
[10:06.820 --> 10:11.740]  this spring, chilling a once booming pot industry and leading to sweeping changes in Montana
[10:11.740 --> 10:12.980]  laws.
[10:12.980 --> 10:16.300]  The Department of Justice followed up with a warning letter to political leaders in many
[10:16.300 --> 10:20.980]  states that federal prosecutors will pursue marijuana distributors, but not individual
[10:20.980 --> 10:23.820]  patients who are following state law.
[10:23.820 --> 10:27.640]  The letter the ATF sent to gun dealers last week was first reported by Lee newspapers
[10:27.640 --> 10:29.060]  of Montana.
[10:29.060 --> 10:33.340]  Medical marijuana and gun groups said the policy clarification amounts to rescinding
[10:33.340 --> 10:38.060]  the gun rights for the thousands of people licensed to use medical marijuana laws.
[10:38.060 --> 10:43.220]  And it appears to contradict the 2009 Department of Justice memo that said Obama administration
[10:43.220 --> 10:47.620]  would not pursue prosecution of individual medical marijuana users who will base state
[10:47.620 --> 10:48.620]  laws.
[10:48.620 --> 10:52.560]  Beside that, the government is putting an additional burden on gun dealers to police
[10:52.560 --> 10:54.360]  their customers, he said.
[10:54.360 --> 10:57.720]  Montana said Montana Shooting Sports Association.
[10:57.720 --> 10:59.640]  Gary Marbutt.
[10:59.640 --> 11:02.160]  Their business is to be merchants, not to be cops.
[11:02.160 --> 11:06.560]  Unfortunately, the federal licensing scheme complicates that Marbutt said.
[11:06.560 --> 11:12.360]  It sounds as if the ATF is expecting them to drift further into that cop role.
[11:12.360 --> 11:15.280]  Could you imagine that you guys now that if you're a gun sale seller, you don't have to
[11:15.280 --> 11:16.340]  just follow that paper.
[11:16.340 --> 11:20.360]  You actually have to like talk to everybody and try to act like you're the cops also.
[11:20.360 --> 11:22.680]  And there are going to be a bunch of vigilantes.
[11:22.680 --> 11:26.400]  They're going to see somebody like I bet if I went into a gun store, they would deny me
[11:26.400 --> 11:28.080]  a sale.
[11:28.080 --> 11:30.760]  Even if I never figured out this question or filled out this questionnaire, they'd say
[11:30.760 --> 11:33.240]  you're a pothead, you cannot buy a gun.
[11:33.240 --> 11:39.920]  And that is now up to vaguely up to the store owner or the salesperson, which is kind of
[11:39.920 --> 11:40.920]  ridiculous.
[11:40.920 --> 11:43.480]  I'll keep reading the article here.
[11:43.480 --> 11:45.360]  Protecting America from criminals.
[11:45.360 --> 11:49.280]  Wade said both the 2009 memo and last week's letter were approved by the Justice Department
[11:49.280 --> 11:52.640]  and he does not believe there is a contradiction in the two messages.
[11:52.640 --> 11:58.580]  He also he also that the dealers are in good position to help prevent firearms from getting
[11:58.580 --> 12:00.360]  into the wrong hands.
[12:00.360 --> 12:01.360]  They must have omitted a word.
[12:01.360 --> 12:04.920]  I'm going to say he also said that the dealers are in a good position to help prevent firearms
[12:04.920 --> 12:06.320]  from getting into the wrong hands.
[12:06.320 --> 12:07.680]  That makes more sense.
[12:07.680 --> 12:10.120]  The FFL aren't cops.
[12:10.120 --> 12:14.080]  They are at the front line of protecting America from criminals or people who are prohibited
[12:14.080 --> 12:16.040]  prohibited from possessing firearms.
[12:16.040 --> 12:21.720]  Wade said a salesman at once licensed firearms dealer Montana Outdoor Sports and Helena said
[12:21.720 --> 12:26.200]  he doesn't expect much to change as a result of the letter because it's largely up to the
[12:26.200 --> 12:30.240]  buyer to reveal whether he or she is a medical marijuana user.
[12:30.240 --> 12:31.680]  Who's going to say yes to that?
[12:31.680 --> 12:36.240]  Asked Damon Peters, a sales associate for the store and a licensed hunting guide.
[12:36.240 --> 12:40.680]  A lot of you, a lot of users of medical marijuana aren't really shooting sports enthusiasts
[12:40.680 --> 12:41.680]  anyway.
[12:41.680 --> 12:45.560]  I think we may see a sale or two lost, but I don't see anything dramatic that's going
[12:45.560 --> 12:46.560]  to affect us.
[12:46.560 --> 12:48.880]  He said.
[12:48.880 --> 12:53.360]  So there's a lot of talk about guns going on in our country later lately.
[12:53.360 --> 12:56.560]  And I, uh, I support guns.
[12:56.560 --> 12:59.920]  I mean, if they took away all the guns, the only people that would have guns would be
[12:59.920 --> 13:00.980]  the bad guys, right?
[13:00.980 --> 13:02.440]  That's kind of the way that works, right?
[13:02.440 --> 13:05.280]  If the guns were illegal, the old, like the criminals aren't going to care that the guns
[13:05.280 --> 13:06.280]  are illegal.
[13:06.280 --> 13:07.920]  They're not going to be like, Oh, here's my guns.
[13:07.920 --> 13:10.640]  That's just gonna, that's bullshit of a theory, I think.
[13:10.640 --> 13:16.560]  So now what's happening is if you are a medical marijuana patient, you are not allowed to
[13:16.560 --> 13:18.840]  purchase a firearm.
[13:18.840 --> 13:19.960]  What kind of shit is that?
[13:19.960 --> 13:22.960]  Just because, so here's another side of this.
[13:22.960 --> 13:25.320]  I can be a Vicodin patient.
[13:25.320 --> 13:27.960]  I can be a Valium patient.
[13:27.960 --> 13:34.520]  I can be maybe some sort of a antidepressant user, a patient, whatever you call the person
[13:34.520 --> 13:37.000]  that's taking that.
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.320]  And then I'm able to buy a gun.
[13:38.320 --> 13:42.920]  I can take my Vicodin, my Ritalin, my Valium, my Ambien.
[13:42.920 --> 13:44.880]  And what else could I take possibly to go with this?
[13:44.880 --> 13:48.720]  My Celebrex and my Vicodin, and then a boner pill, because everybody's got to have a boner
[13:48.720 --> 13:49.920]  pill, right?
[13:49.920 --> 13:54.400]  I could take all of those and then I could go buy a gun, but I can't use my medical cannabis
[13:54.400 --> 14:01.200]  to ease my pain a little bit or help my appetite and then purchase a firearm to either protect
[14:01.200 --> 14:05.800]  my home or hunt for food or just have it because I'm a good old American and I should have
[14:05.800 --> 14:07.380]  a damn gun.
[14:07.380 --> 14:08.900]  This is kind of a ridiculous law.
[14:08.900 --> 14:11.860]  I thought that everybody should be made aware of this.
[14:11.860 --> 14:15.260]  I don't know what we can do about it, but I thought it was very interesting.
[14:15.260 --> 14:17.700]  How, who?
[14:17.700 --> 14:20.740]  They are kind of right though about the people that smoke medical cannabis not wanting to
[14:20.740 --> 14:25.300]  be hunters and shooters, but this is Colorado and you'd be surprised the diversity of people
[14:25.300 --> 14:26.300]  here.
[14:26.300 --> 14:29.940]  I've got friends who have dreadlocks, who snowboard on the one weekend and who will
[14:29.940 --> 14:32.460]  go elk hunting the next weekend.
[14:32.460 --> 14:36.920]  They may be wrong with their assumptions on who is hunting and who is using cannabis.
[14:36.960 --> 14:37.960]  I may be bullshit.
[14:37.960 --> 14:42.480]  There's so much in this article that we could bitch about, but instead let's move on to
[14:42.480 --> 14:45.560]  a little bit more of a positive note.
[14:45.560 --> 14:51.280]  This article comes from the Washington Post and it is written by a guy named Radley Balco
[14:51.280 --> 14:56.500]  and the headline is since marijuana legalization, highway fatalities in Colorado are at a near
[14:56.500 --> 14:57.920]  historic low.
[14:57.920 --> 14:58.920]  Yes.
[14:58.920 --> 15:00.440]  Let me read this article for you.
[15:00.440 --> 15:05.920]  It says since Colorado voters legalized pot in 2012 prohibition supporters have warned
[15:05.920 --> 15:10.360]  that recreational marijuana will lead to a scourge of drugged drivers on the state's
[15:10.360 --> 15:11.360]  roads.
[15:11.360 --> 15:16.480]  They often point out that when the state legalized medical marijuana in 2001 there was a surge
[15:16.480 --> 15:18.800]  in drivers found to have smoked pot.
[15:18.800 --> 15:22.860]  They also point to studies showing that in other states, uh, showing that in other states
[15:22.860 --> 15:27.680]  that have legalized pot for medicinal purposes, we've seen an increase in the number of drivers
[15:27.680 --> 15:31.780]  testing positive for the drug who were involved in fatal car accidents.
[15:31.780 --> 15:35.820]  The anti-pot group, Sam recently pointed out that even before the first legal pot store
[15:35.820 --> 15:39.760]  opened in Washington state, the number of drivers in that state testing positive for
[15:39.760 --> 15:42.260]  pot jumped by a third.
[15:42.260 --> 15:46.320]  The problem with these criticisms is that we can test only for the president presence
[15:46.320 --> 15:49.860]  of marijuana metabolites, not for inebriation.
[15:49.860 --> 15:53.780]  Metabolites can linger in the body for days after the drugs effects wear off.
[15:53.780 --> 15:55.020]  Sometimes even for weeks.
[15:55.020 --> 15:57.780]  Um, I'm a very heavy, I'm going to chime in myself here.
[15:57.780 --> 16:03.700]  I'm a very heavy cannabis user and a long time ago, uh, this had to be, um, nearly 10
[16:03.700 --> 16:04.700]  years ago.
[16:04.700 --> 16:08.620]  I was trying to get a good job that would have paid very well and had some great benefits.
[16:08.620 --> 16:13.580]  And so I quit smoking cannabis and I was, all I had to do is pass one drug test.
[16:13.580 --> 16:17.060]  All this place did was one pre-hire screening and then I would have been home free.
[16:17.060 --> 16:20.860]  I could work there forever and never had to pee test again unless I hurt myself.
[16:20.860 --> 16:23.060]  At which case I would have just walked away.
[16:23.060 --> 16:29.820]  Um, so I went, uh, 30 days and I took a voluntary pee test that you can buy at the store and
[16:29.820 --> 16:31.420]  I was still dirty.
[16:31.420 --> 16:34.580]  I went 45 days and took a pee test and I was still dirty.
[16:34.580 --> 16:38.980]  I went 60 days and I took a pee test and I was still dirty, but I already had my interview
[16:38.980 --> 16:39.980]  scheduled.
[16:39.980 --> 16:44.540]  So 63 days in, I went and took a pee test and the doctor called me back and told me
[16:44.540 --> 16:51.460]  that I still had more than 1400 nanograms per, uh, whatever their measurement was.
[16:51.460 --> 16:55.980]  I had more than their limit of THC in my urine after 63 days.
[16:55.980 --> 16:59.220]  And he asked me if I was taking prescription Marinol or what I was doing.
[16:59.220 --> 17:03.740]  And I told him that I hadn't smoked in nine weeks and he was a little bit blown away.
[17:03.740 --> 17:08.260]  So they're saying that metabolites can linger in the body for days, sometimes even weeks.
[17:08.260 --> 17:10.380]  Um, I am a prime example.
[17:10.380 --> 17:13.940]  I went nine weeks and there was still cannabis in my system.
[17:13.940 --> 17:18.560]  Uh, let me tell you that on day 64 I took a fat bong hit and I don't think I've ever
[17:18.560 --> 17:20.140]  been that fucking high in my life.
[17:20.820 --> 17:22.500]  All right, I'm going to continue on with the article here.
[17:22.500 --> 17:26.700]  It says because we all metabolize drugs differently and at different times and under different
[17:26.700 --> 17:30.580]  conditions, all that positive test tells us is that the driver has smoked pot at some
[17:30.580 --> 17:32.900]  point in the past few days or weeks.
[17:32.900 --> 17:36.340]  It makes sense that loosening restrictions on pot would result in higher, in a higher
[17:36.340 --> 17:39.220]  percentage of drivers involved in fatal traffic accidents.
[17:39.220 --> 17:44.060]  Having smoked the drug at some point over the past few days or weeks, you'd also expect
[17:44.060 --> 17:47.940]  to find that a higher percentage of church growers, good Samaritans and soup kitchen
[17:47.940 --> 17:50.340]  volunteers would have pot in their system.
[17:50.340 --> 17:54.100]  It expect a similar result among any large sampling of people.
[17:54.100 --> 17:58.740]  This doesn't necessarily mean that marijuana caused or was even a contributing factor to
[17:58.740 --> 18:01.720]  accidents, traffic violations, or fatalities.
[18:01.720 --> 18:06.140]  This isn't an argument that pot wasn't a factor in at least some of those accidents either,
[18:06.140 --> 18:07.700]  but that's precisely the point.
[18:07.700 --> 18:13.060]  A post accident test for marijuana metabolites doesn't tell us much about whether a pot contributed
[18:13.060 --> 18:14.460]  to the accident.
[18:14.460 --> 18:19.980]  Since the new Colorado law took effect in January, the drug driver panic has only intensified.
[18:19.980 --> 18:23.980]  I've already written about one dubious example in which the Colorado Highway Patrol and some
[18:23.980 --> 18:29.300]  local and had some local and national media perpetuated a story that a driver was high
[18:29.300 --> 18:33.340]  on pot when he slammed into a couple of police cars parked on an interstate exit ramp.
[18:33.340 --> 18:38.060]  While the driver did have some pot in his system, his blood alcohol level was off the
[18:38.060 --> 18:41.180]  charts and was far more likely the cause of the accident.
[18:41.300 --> 18:43.540]  That's something that we've seen a few times here.
[18:43.540 --> 18:46.460]  People will be on other drugs, they'll be drunk and they'll get in an accident and they'll
[18:46.460 --> 18:50.540]  have a little bit of cannabis in their system and they blame that shit on the cannabis.
[18:50.540 --> 18:54.780]  They overlook the fact that this guy was on four hits of acid, that he was tweaking his
[18:54.780 --> 18:59.100]  brains out, that he had mushrooms in his brain, but he smoked a little bit of weed so that
[18:59.100 --> 19:02.980]  had to have been what sent him over the edge and made him crash his car.
[19:02.980 --> 19:04.820]  We're going to go a little bit more here.
[19:04.820 --> 19:09.980]  Where the hell was I?
[19:09.980 --> 19:14.460]  In my colleague Mark Fisher's recent dispatch from Colorado, law enforcement officials there
[19:14.460 --> 19:17.740]  and in bordering states warn that they're seeing more drug drivers.
[19:17.740 --> 19:22.220]  Congress recently held hearings on the matter, complete with dire predictions such as we're
[19:22.220 --> 19:26.660]  going to have a lot more people stoned on the highway and there will be consequences
[19:26.660 --> 19:30.380]  from Rep. John Micah of Florida.
[19:30.380 --> 19:32.300]  Some have called for a zero tolerance policy.
[19:32.300 --> 19:36.500]  If you're driving with any trace of pot in your system, you're guilty of a DWI.
[19:36.500 --> 19:40.260]  I would effectively ban anyone who smokes pot from driving up to a couple of weeks after
[19:40.260 --> 19:46.180]  the last joint, including people who legitimately use the drug for medical reasons.
[19:46.180 --> 19:48.500]  That means that I would never be able to drive again.
[19:48.500 --> 19:51.060]  That is basically what that shit says.
[19:51.060 --> 19:56.380]  That says that any medical cannabis user in Colorado would not be able to drive.
[19:56.380 --> 20:00.400]  And I guess now you can't drive or have a gun is the two articles that I've read today.
[20:00.400 --> 20:02.140]  This is getting a little crazy.
[20:02.140 --> 20:03.820]  Police state much with a question mark.
[20:03.820 --> 20:05.300]  All right, I'm going to read more of the article.
[20:05.300 --> 20:06.300]  Here we go.
[20:06.300 --> 20:10.220]  It seems to me that the best way to gauge the effect, gauge the effect legalization
[20:10.220 --> 20:14.420]  has had on the roadways is to look at what happened on the road since legalization took
[20:14.420 --> 20:15.420]  effect.
[20:15.420 --> 20:19.220]  Here's a month by month comparison of highway fatalities in Colorado through the first seven
[20:19.220 --> 20:21.360]  months of this year and last year.
[20:21.360 --> 20:26.060]  For more thorough comparison, I've also included the highest fatality figures for each month
[20:26.060 --> 20:32.060]  since 2002, the lowest for each month since 2002 and the average for each month since
[20:32.060 --> 20:33.060]  2002.
[20:33.060 --> 20:34.220]  And there is a graph here, you guys.
[20:34.220 --> 20:37.780]  I know graphs don't do you any good on the podcast, but we're going to look at this.
[20:37.780 --> 20:41.460]  The high since 2002 they are showing.
[20:41.460 --> 20:47.120]  All right, so there are one, two, three, four, five lines on this graph, right?
[20:47.120 --> 20:51.000]  And basically it is showing you that shit has gone down.
[20:51.000 --> 20:52.320]  Just take my word for it.
[20:52.320 --> 20:56.740]  So it says, as you can see, roadway fatalities this year are down from last year and down
[20:56.740 --> 21:00.980]  from the 13 year average of the seven months so far this year, five months saw a lower
[21:00.980 --> 21:03.820]  fatality figure than the last.
[21:03.820 --> 21:07.860]  Two months saw a slightly higher figure this year and in one month, the two figures were
[21:07.860 --> 21:08.860]  equal.
[21:08.860 --> 21:14.260]  If we add up the total fatalities from January through July, it looks like this.
[21:14.260 --> 21:18.760]  And we're going to see, it's a downsloping graph, you guys.
[21:18.760 --> 21:19.760]  Just take my word for that.
[21:19.760 --> 21:20.760]  It is a downsloping.
[21:20.760 --> 21:22.340]  It starts high and it goes low.
[21:22.340 --> 21:23.540]  And then I'll read the rest of the article.
[21:23.540 --> 21:28.460]  It says here the high bar, and he says, pardon the pun, the high bar is what you get when
[21:28.460 --> 21:34.060]  you add the worst January since 2002 to the worst February to the worst March and so on.
[21:34.060 --> 21:40.020]  The low bar is the sum total of the safest January, February, et cetera, since 2002.
[21:40.020 --> 21:45.620]  What's notable here is that the total so far in 2014 are closer to the safest composite
[21:45.620 --> 21:50.460]  year since 2002 than to the average year since 2002.
[21:50.460 --> 21:53.740]  I should also add here that these are total fatalities.
[21:53.740 --> 21:58.380]  If I were to calculate these figures as a rate, say miles driven per fatality, the drop
[21:58.380 --> 22:04.940]  would be starker both for this year and since Colorado legalized medical marijuana in 2001.
[22:04.940 --> 22:08.420]  While the number of miles Americans drive annually has leveled off nationally since
[22:08.420 --> 22:13.760]  the mid 2000s, the number of total miles traveled continues to go up in Colorado.
[22:13.760 --> 22:19.380]  If I were to measure by rate, then the state would be at lows unseen in decades.
[22:19.380 --> 22:24.460]  So we're driving even more is what he's saying, and we are crashing even less.
[22:24.460 --> 22:27.340]  The figures are similar in states that have legalized medical marijuana.
[22:27.340 --> 22:31.260]  While some studies have shown that the number of drivers involved in fatal collisions who
[22:31.260 --> 22:36.540]  test positive for marijuana had steadily increased as pot has become more available.
[22:36.540 --> 22:40.420]  Other studies have shown that overall traffic fatalities in those states have dropped.
[22:40.420 --> 22:45.220]  Again, because the pot tests only measure for recent pot use, not inebriation.
[22:45.220 --> 22:49.140]  There's nothing inconsistent about those results.
[22:49.180 --> 22:52.860]  Of course, the continuing drop in roadway fatalities in Colorado and elsewhere is due
[22:52.860 --> 22:57.580]  to a variety of factors such as better built cars and trucks, improved safety features,
[22:57.580 --> 22:59.420]  and better road engineering.
[22:59.420 --> 23:03.260]  These features in and of themselves only indicate that the roads are getting safer.
[23:03.260 --> 23:06.380]  They don't suggest that pot had anything to do with it.
[23:06.380 --> 23:07.500]  We're only seven months in.
[23:07.500 --> 23:09.180]  Maybe these figures will change.
[23:09.180 --> 23:16.020]  Finally, it's also possible that if it weren't for legal pot, the 2014 figures would be even lower.
[23:16.020 --> 23:17.600]  There's no real way to know that.
[23:17.600 --> 23:19.600]  We can only look at the data available.
[23:19.600 --> 23:23.280]  But you can bet that if fatalities were up this year, prohibition supporters would be
[23:23.280 --> 23:25.440]  blaming it on legal marijuana.
[23:25.440 --> 23:29.920]  Interestingly, though road fatalities have generally been falling in Colorado for a long
[23:29.920 --> 23:34.480]  time, 2013 actually saw a slight decrease from 2012.
[23:34.480 --> 23:40.640]  So fatalities are down the year after legalization after having gone up the year before.
[23:40.640 --> 23:45.920]  So that being said, some researchers have gone so far as to suggest that better access
[23:45.920 --> 23:49.200]  to pot is making the roads safer, at least marginally.
[23:49.200 --> 23:55.520]  The theory is that people are substituting pot for alcohol and pot causes less driver
[23:55.520 --> 23:57.320]  impairment than booze.
[23:57.320 --> 24:01.120]  I'd need to see more studies before I'd be ready to endorse that theory.
[24:01.120 --> 24:05.560]  For example, there's also some research contradicting the theory that drinkers are ready to substitute
[24:05.560 --> 24:07.520]  pot for alcohol.
[24:07.520 --> 24:14.280]  You know that, uh, I quit drinking completely when I got my medical marijuana card.
[24:14.280 --> 24:17.160]  I said to myself, I'm able to go to the store and buy cannabis now.
[24:17.160 --> 24:21.160]  I could buy all the herb I want, like, because before you'd have to wait for your dude to
[24:21.160 --> 24:24.240]  have some, or you'd have to grow your own, or you'd have to wait for your crop to be
[24:24.240 --> 24:27.360]  ready or you'd hope one of your bros had a joint.
[24:27.360 --> 24:31.200]  But when I got my medical marijuana card and I could just smoke down and then go to the
[24:31.200 --> 24:33.160]  store and buy some more and then smoke down.
[24:33.160 --> 24:37.640]  And when I ran out and just go to the store tomorrow, I didn't even need to drink anymore.
[24:37.640 --> 24:39.560]  Uh, I, I quit drinking.
[24:39.560 --> 24:43.920]  I haven't had alcohol in so many years and now I smoke all the cannabis I want.
[24:43.920 --> 24:45.760]  There's no need to drink when I can smoke her.
[24:45.760 --> 24:48.160]  All right, I'll continue with the article.
[24:48.160 --> 24:52.520]  It says, but the data are far more supportive of that than the claims that stone drivers
[24:52.520 --> 24:54.560]  are menacing Colorado's roadways.
[24:54.560 --> 24:55.640]  And then he says, clarification.
[24:55.640 --> 24:59.600]  I wrote that we can test only for the presence of marijuana metabolites, not for any abbreviation.
[24:59.600 --> 25:00.600]  That isn't quite accurate.
[25:00.600 --> 25:04.600]  Uh, he does go on to say, this is true of roadside tests, but a blood test taken at
[25:04.600 --> 25:08.040]  a hospital can measure for THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.
[25:08.040 --> 25:09.840]  Oh, he said ingredient.
[25:09.840 --> 25:11.160]  We got to change that to compound.
[25:11.160 --> 25:14.520]  I'm crossing it out on the keyboard screen or on the computer screen or writing compound.
[25:14.520 --> 25:17.880]  Uh, that being said, even here, there are problems.
[25:17.880 --> 25:20.760]  Regular users can still have remnant THC in their blood.
[25:20.760 --> 25:25.000]  Well after the effects of worn off, regular users can also have levels above the legal
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.040]  limit and still drive perfectly.
[25:27.040 --> 25:32.080]  Well, he's talking about me in Colorado, a THC level of five nanograms or more brings
[25:32.080 --> 25:34.800]  a presumptive charge of driving under the influence.
[25:34.800 --> 25:39.320]  However, reference references to marijuana related accidents and studies by prohibitionists
[25:39.320 --> 25:43.040]  and law enforcement could refer to any measure or trace of the drug.
[25:43.040 --> 25:47.400]  So when officials and legalization opponents talk about increases in these figures, it
[25:47.400 --> 25:52.640]  still isn't clear what any of this means for road safety because I need to take a quick
[25:52.640 --> 25:56.080]  drink, excuse me for one minute, and then we will talk about this.
[25:56.080 --> 26:03.490]  All right, my throat is back in action.
[26:03.490 --> 26:05.410]  I was getting dry there.
[26:05.410 --> 26:09.970]  So since we have legalized cannabis, the traffic has been safer.
[26:09.970 --> 26:13.090]  Um, when you get drunk, you drive recklessly.
[26:13.090 --> 26:14.090]  You don't give a shit.
[26:14.090 --> 26:15.370]  You want to go really, really fast.
[26:15.370 --> 26:16.410]  You're not paying attention.
[26:16.410 --> 26:19.010]  You're blacked out and you're just fucking driving and getting there.
[26:19.010 --> 26:20.130]  You don't care what lane you're in.
[26:20.130 --> 26:22.650]  You don't care what direction you're going.
[26:22.650 --> 26:25.130]  Probably don't even know where the hell you're trying to go.
[26:25.130 --> 26:30.970]  But when you're high, you're just calm and you look twice and you go a little bit under
[26:30.970 --> 26:33.810]  the speed limit because I don't want to go too fast.
[26:33.810 --> 26:34.810]  I'm high, man.
[26:34.810 --> 26:35.810]  You just want to cruise.
[26:35.810 --> 26:39.370]  You want to put the music at a comfortable level and you want to watch everything come
[26:39.370 --> 26:40.770]  at you at a decent pace.
[26:41.290 --> 26:44.130]  Like I never get too crazy when I'm driving high.
[26:44.130 --> 26:48.890]  I will admit that when I was a youngster, I would drive a little bit drunk and that
[26:48.890 --> 26:49.970]  was some scary shit.
[26:49.970 --> 26:54.050]  I have never been scared of myself driving high, but I have scared the shit out of myself
[26:54.050 --> 26:55.930]  driving too drunk.
[26:55.930 --> 26:58.730]  It'll never happen again because I don't drink alcohol so I can talk about it freely.
[26:58.730 --> 27:01.210]  All right, you guys, let's see how far into this show we are.
[27:01.210 --> 27:03.570]  All right, we're already 27 minutes in.
[27:03.570 --> 27:06.730]  That last article took a little longer than I had anticipated.
[27:06.730 --> 27:09.170]  So why don't we go ahead and wrap up the show?
[27:09.170 --> 27:11.310]  You guys, I'm really trying to get Maddie and Spencer on.
[27:11.310 --> 27:13.730]  They have been a couple of busy suckers.
[27:13.730 --> 27:15.170]  They just had a big fat harvest.
[27:15.170 --> 27:18.890]  They just pulled their first round of seeds from their first breeding run.
[27:18.890 --> 27:23.690]  They're getting ready for the 710 party at the Lazy Lion this weekend.
[27:23.690 --> 27:24.970]  I'm trying to get them on.
[27:24.970 --> 27:26.470]  Hopefully they'll be available tomorrow.
[27:26.470 --> 27:27.470]  We can get them on the podcast.
[27:27.470 --> 27:31.930]  I've got a lot of cool stuff written down to talk to them about.
[27:31.930 --> 27:32.930]  Let's see.
[27:32.930 --> 27:35.330]  I will do another Periscope show really soon here.
[27:35.330 --> 27:39.110]  I like to open up Periscope and hit go on Periscope as I record the podcast.
[27:40.050 --> 27:41.430]  If you don't know about Periscope yet, check that out.
[27:41.430 --> 27:43.870]  My account is under at Rasta Jeff 420.
