[00:00.000 --> 00:02.880]  All right, here we go.
[00:02.880 --> 00:04.360]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:04.360 --> 00:05.360]  I'm your host.
[00:05.360 --> 00:10.960]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 611 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:10.960 --> 00:13.960]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of grow questions.

[01:17.520 --> 01:18.760]  All of the information you need
[01:18.760 --> 01:20.000]  will be right there on the screen.
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.520]  And you know I did put a link in the show notes
[01:22.520 --> 01:24.000]  and in the video description
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.920]  to make it super easy for all of my friends.
[01:26.920 --> 01:28.120]  Really you guys thank you
[01:28.120 --> 01:30.640]  for all of the continued Patreon support.
[01:30.640 --> 01:32.080]  I do appreciate that.
[01:32.080 --> 01:33.240]  Where are we gonna go from here?
[01:33.240 --> 01:35.400]  Let's start off with talking about LEDs.
[01:35.400 --> 01:38.840]  Big shout out to my friend Keith at Black Sale Market.
[01:38.840 --> 01:41.880]  I have switched my own personal breeding area
[01:41.880 --> 01:44.120]  to all complete LED lighting.
[01:44.120 --> 01:47.320]  That's right I am now running all complete Canon LEDs
[01:47.320 --> 01:49.360]  in all of my personal grow spaces.
[01:49.360 --> 01:50.320]  And I am loving it.
[01:50.320 --> 01:52.000]  The plants look mostly happy.
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.040]  We're gonna talk about that in a moment.
[01:54.040 --> 01:55.240]  It is all grower error.
[01:55.240 --> 01:56.560]  The plants look mostly happy.
[01:56.560 --> 01:58.000]  I'm seeing a lot of robust growth
[01:58.000 --> 01:59.800]  in most areas of the grow space.
[01:59.800 --> 02:01.240]  I am really satisfied.
[02:01.240 --> 02:03.200]  The electricity bill has gone down.
[02:03.200 --> 02:04.440]  The amount of cooling I need,
[02:04.440 --> 02:07.640]  the amount of ducting and ventilation I need has gone down.
[02:07.640 --> 02:12.180]  So I am impressed and ecstatic with my new LED lights,
[02:12.180 --> 02:14.900]  my Canon LEDs from Black Sale Market.
[02:14.900 --> 02:16.680]  Big shout out to my friends at Black Sale Market.
[02:16.680 --> 02:19.360]  Check them out and use coupon code Rasta Jeff.
[02:19.360 --> 02:20.880]  That will help you out just a little bit.
[02:20.880 --> 02:23.080]  Keith did not pay me for that ad or anything.
[02:23.080 --> 02:24.400]  I'm just giving him a shout out
[02:24.400 --> 02:26.180]  because I do love the lights.
[02:26.180 --> 02:28.940]  The plants look great in most areas.
[02:28.940 --> 02:30.240]  Let me do a disclaimer.
[02:30.240 --> 02:31.340]  I did fuck up.
[02:31.340 --> 02:33.640]  There is an error in one part of my grow area.
[02:33.640 --> 02:34.580]  I messed up.
[02:34.580 --> 02:36.720]  I let the plants get a little bit too tall.
[02:36.720 --> 02:39.300]  They got a little bit too close to that LED light.
[02:39.300 --> 02:40.140]  Guess what?
[02:40.140 --> 02:41.800]  They're starting to yellow up just a little bit,
[02:41.800 --> 02:43.680]  but it is a learning experience.
[02:43.680 --> 02:45.600]  I knew exactly what was causing it.
[02:45.600 --> 02:47.420]  The plants just looked yellow.
[02:47.420 --> 02:49.020]  And I was like, what is going on?
[02:49.020 --> 02:50.560]  And then I thought about it and I looked around
[02:51.240 --> 02:52.280]  and I said, they're just too close to the new light.
[02:52.280 --> 02:54.160]  That is the only variable in the room.
[02:54.160 --> 02:57.400]  So when we are learning to work with new lights,
[02:57.400 --> 02:59.040]  we may want to keep them a little bit higher.
[02:59.040 --> 03:00.300]  That's something that I messed up.
[03:00.300 --> 03:02.240]  There is a learning curve.
[03:02.240 --> 03:05.200]  What I have done to fix that is just turn down the lights.
[03:05.200 --> 03:08.960]  They are 315 or 325 Watts when you start.
[03:08.960 --> 03:10.920]  I simply cranked them down to 240.
[03:10.920 --> 03:11.980]  The plants are recovering.
[03:11.980 --> 03:12.880]  They're greening back up.
[03:12.880 --> 03:13.980]  They're looking good.
[03:13.980 --> 03:16.760]  I topped them just to get that main top out of the way.
[03:16.760 --> 03:17.880]  Turn the lights down,
[03:17.880 --> 03:20.800]  hit them with a little foliar feed of base nutrients.
[03:20.800 --> 03:23.120]  I put a little push in there as well.
[03:23.120 --> 03:24.440]  The plants are back on track.
[03:24.440 --> 03:25.400]  Everybody looks happy,
[03:25.400 --> 03:28.680]  but there was a little bit of a learning curve.
[03:28.680 --> 03:30.260]  There are a few things to talk about there.
[03:30.260 --> 03:32.520]  I love the LED lights, but if you're going to use them,
[03:32.520 --> 03:34.880]  make sure they are the appropriate distance away
[03:34.880 --> 03:35.760]  from your plants.
[03:35.760 --> 03:37.000]  That's something we should talk about.
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.600]  Also, don't be afraid to learn.
[03:40.600 --> 03:41.680]  You guys, I made a mistake
[03:41.680 --> 03:43.080]  and my plants are kind of yellowed out
[03:43.080 --> 03:44.400]  and I had to recover from that.
[03:44.400 --> 03:45.280]  But guess what?
[03:45.280 --> 03:46.400]  I learned that lesson.
[03:46.400 --> 03:47.840]  I only have to learn that once.
[03:47.840 --> 03:49.240]  We are past that.
[03:49.240 --> 03:51.600]  Where do we go from here?
[03:51.600 --> 03:54.360]  I have seen a lot of people on social media
[03:54.360 --> 03:57.000]  having a heartbreak over discovering
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.880]  that their gigantic plants are now males.
[03:59.880 --> 04:01.640]  They put these big ass plants into males
[04:01.640 --> 04:02.520]  and they are heartbroken.
[04:02.520 --> 04:04.440]  I keep seeing this on social media.
[04:04.440 --> 04:07.280]  I talked about this in outdoor season.
[04:07.280 --> 04:08.660]  It was kind of looked over
[04:08.660 --> 04:10.320]  and I realized that people don't really go back
[04:10.320 --> 04:11.740]  and listen to old episodes.
[04:11.740 --> 04:13.420]  So that one is gone.
[04:13.420 --> 04:15.240]  People are not listening to that anymore.
[04:15.240 --> 04:19.000]  So let's kind of talk about sexing our cannabis plants.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.960]  That way, when you're growing these big giant plants,
[04:21.960 --> 04:25.200]  you don't discover later on after spending time,
[04:25.200 --> 04:29.340]  money, energy, nutrients, whatever you're putting into it,
[04:29.340 --> 04:32.040]  you don't waste all this time, money, energy, nutrients,
[04:32.040 --> 04:35.320]  space, space is expensive, on growing a male plant.
[04:35.320 --> 04:37.960]  A responsible farmer tests for sex
[04:37.960 --> 04:40.960]  before investing all of this time, space, energy,
[04:40.960 --> 04:42.040]  and money into a plant
[04:42.040 --> 04:44.700]  that we're going to have to chop down and throw away.
[04:44.700 --> 04:46.860]  If you're a new grower, that can be really heartbreaking.
[04:46.860 --> 04:49.000]  A lot of times you just spent all of your money
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.920]  on new seeds, on new equipment,
[04:50.920 --> 04:52.660]  and now you find out that that plant is a male
[04:52.660 --> 04:53.780]  and you've grown it way too big.
[04:53.780 --> 04:55.720]  There are ways to prevent that.
[04:55.720 --> 04:59.740]  Let's talk about how to quickly and responsibly find out
[04:59.740 --> 05:01.800]  if we are growing male or female plants
[05:01.800 --> 05:04.600]  before we get them into the grow space.
[05:04.600 --> 05:07.500]  If you spend a month vegging that, you've watered it.
[05:07.500 --> 05:09.020]  If you water it three times a week,
[05:09.020 --> 05:10.540]  you probably watered 12 times.
[05:10.540 --> 05:11.980]  You put nutrients in there.
[05:11.980 --> 05:13.820]  You spent time pH-ing the water.
[05:13.820 --> 05:15.340]  You've got a light running for a month,
[05:15.340 --> 05:17.260]  maybe two months at this point.
[05:17.260 --> 05:18.460]  That's going to cost you money.
[05:18.460 --> 05:20.020]  That soil costs you money.
[05:20.020 --> 05:21.940]  Just having that space wasted
[05:21.940 --> 05:23.380]  technically is costing you money.
[05:23.380 --> 05:25.340]  If that grow space is not producing,
[05:25.340 --> 05:27.260]  it is an expense at that time.
[05:27.260 --> 05:30.020]  So if we could find out if our plants are males or females
[05:30.020 --> 05:32.400]  much more quickly, that would be beneficial.
[05:32.400 --> 05:33.620]  One thing I want to touch on
[05:33.620 --> 05:35.420]  that I did not write on my notes here
[05:35.420 --> 05:38.620]  is the quickest way to sex them is a sex test.
[05:38.620 --> 05:39.940]  We have science now.
[05:39.940 --> 05:43.560]  You can easily order these little cards from a testing lab.
[05:44.300 --> 05:46.600]  You can rub a leaf onto the testing card.
[05:46.600 --> 05:48.320]  All you need is some of the juice from the plant
[05:48.320 --> 05:49.880]  to transfer onto the card.
[05:49.880 --> 05:51.400]  You fold the card back up.
[05:51.400 --> 05:55.020]  You mark that plant, plant number 9,653.
[05:55.020 --> 05:57.640]  You mark the card 9,653,
[05:57.640 --> 06:00.020]  and you mail that card into the testing lab.
[06:00.020 --> 06:02.620]  They will tell you if that plant is a male or a female.
[06:02.620 --> 06:05.240]  That is the quickest, most efficient way
[06:05.240 --> 06:08.140]  to identify male and female plants in your grow.
[06:08.140 --> 06:09.400]  Of course, if the plant is male
[06:09.400 --> 06:10.500]  and you're not looking to breed,
[06:10.500 --> 06:12.180]  then you can get rid of it at that point.
[06:12.180 --> 06:13.940]  You've only got female plants to work with.
[06:13.940 --> 06:15.980]  You've bought yourself more space.
[06:15.980 --> 06:17.020]  You're not going to waste time
[06:17.020 --> 06:18.920]  watering that male plant that you didn't need.
[06:18.920 --> 06:21.460]  You're not gonna up-pot that thing into a bigger plant
[06:21.460 --> 06:23.540]  because this should happen when they're in tiny pots.
[06:23.540 --> 06:25.860]  Either people say that cups are for beer,
[06:25.860 --> 06:28.460]  but I know a lot of people, I'm guilty of it myself,
[06:28.460 --> 06:30.020]  I grow in beer cups.
[06:30.020 --> 06:32.300]  I think beer cups are a great place for little clones,
[06:32.300 --> 06:33.620]  little starter plants.
[06:33.620 --> 06:35.340]  Also, in a commercial facility,
[06:35.340 --> 06:37.860]  I use four and six inch net pots.
[06:37.860 --> 06:40.700]  So little plants, get them real tiny.
[06:40.700 --> 06:42.820]  Then do the sex test on the card.
[06:42.820 --> 06:45.620]  Just pull off a leaf, rub it on there, send it in.
[06:45.620 --> 06:47.780]  They will let you know in just a couple of weeks,
[06:47.780 --> 06:50.340]  depending on how busy the lab is, how far away the lab is,
[06:50.340 --> 06:51.780]  they'll let you know very quickly
[06:51.780 --> 06:53.700]  if you've got male or female plants.
[06:53.700 --> 06:56.260]  That is the quickest way to determine
[06:56.260 --> 06:57.820]  if you've got male or female plants.
[06:57.820 --> 06:59.500]  It does cost you a little bit of money.
[06:59.500 --> 07:01.700]  However, if you've only got small space
[07:01.700 --> 07:02.660]  and you're trying to go quickly,
[07:02.660 --> 07:04.420]  maybe that little bit of money is worth it.
[07:04.420 --> 07:07.020]  Some people like to spend that money on those things.
[07:07.020 --> 07:08.700]  People allocate their money for different ways.
[07:08.700 --> 07:10.020]  If you've got the funds, go for it.
[07:10.580 --> 07:12.980]  If you've only got one room
[07:12.980 --> 07:15.260]  and you were trying to find the sex of your plant,
[07:15.260 --> 07:18.180]  how can you do that without disrupting your grow too much?
[07:19.180 --> 07:20.340]  One room, one light.
[07:20.340 --> 07:21.180]  Here's what I would do.
[07:21.180 --> 07:22.700]  I would sprout some seeds.
[07:22.700 --> 07:23.540]  I would grow them.
[07:23.540 --> 07:26.180]  They would really be very tiny.
[07:26.180 --> 07:27.260]  They would be in beer cups.
[07:27.260 --> 07:28.620]  They'd be in six inch net pots.
[07:28.620 --> 07:29.780]  I've said that before.
[07:29.780 --> 07:31.860]  No bigger than a one gallon pot at this time.
[07:31.860 --> 07:34.740]  I don't wanna waste a lot of space, first of all.
[07:34.740 --> 07:37.020]  I don't wanna waste a lot of soil.
[07:37.020 --> 07:38.660]  I don't wanna waste a lot of nutrients.
[07:38.660 --> 07:39.940]  I don't wanna waste a lot of water.
[07:40.780 --> 07:42.340]  I don't wanna waste a lot of light and electricity.
[07:42.340 --> 07:43.620]  I don't need to be wasteful here.
[07:43.620 --> 07:46.660]  So I'm going to pot like a 10 pack.
[07:46.660 --> 07:48.220]  We'll just say we'll do a 10 pack of seeds.
[07:48.220 --> 07:49.660]  I'm allowed to have 12 plants.
[07:49.660 --> 07:51.020]  So a 10 pack keeps me safe.
[07:51.020 --> 07:52.700]  I'm gonna pop 10 seeds.
[07:52.700 --> 07:53.820]  I'm going to veg them out
[07:53.820 --> 07:57.100]  until they are six or eight-ish inches tall.
[07:57.100 --> 07:57.940]  Then at that point,
[07:57.940 --> 08:00.900]  I'm going to put them into 12-12 lighting.
[08:00.900 --> 08:03.340]  I'm going to put them into flower.
[08:03.340 --> 08:05.020]  So I'm gonna let them grow for maybe a week,
[08:05.020 --> 08:07.740]  maybe two weeks, then I'm going to put them into flower.
[08:07.740 --> 08:11.580]  In about seven, 10, maybe 14 days,
[08:11.580 --> 08:13.660]  these plants will definitely have shown me
[08:13.660 --> 08:15.500]  if they are males or females.
[08:15.500 --> 08:17.420]  Now at that point, like I said earlier,
[08:17.420 --> 08:18.340]  if I'm not breeding,
[08:18.340 --> 08:20.080]  I'm going to chop down all the male plants.
[08:20.080 --> 08:21.540]  I'm gonna get those out of the room.
[08:21.540 --> 08:24.140]  I'm gonna take those little tiny six-inch net pots
[08:24.140 --> 08:26.420]  and I'm gonna throw that dirt away or recycle that dirt,
[08:26.420 --> 08:27.800]  whatever I choose to do.
[08:27.800 --> 08:30.700]  Now I've only wasted a couple of six-inch net pots
[08:30.700 --> 08:31.540]  worth of space.
[08:31.540 --> 08:34.380]  I've only wasted two, maybe three or four or five weeks
[08:34.380 --> 08:37.260]  worth of growth of light, watering, airspace,
[08:37.780 --> 08:39.180]  airtime, real estate in the grow.
[08:39.180 --> 08:40.540]  I haven't wasted a whole bunch of time
[08:40.540 --> 08:42.300]  and we didn't need two rooms
[08:42.300 --> 08:44.340]  to determine the sex of these plants.
[08:44.340 --> 08:46.760]  So we're going to grow them until they are big enough
[08:46.760 --> 08:48.940]  that we think they can, that's ready to flip them.
[08:48.940 --> 08:50.140]  Just two weeks is good enough.
[08:50.140 --> 08:53.060]  Get them six, eight, 10 inches tall, then flip them.
[08:53.060 --> 08:54.540]  Put them on 12-12.
[08:54.540 --> 08:56.680]  Then once they've showed you their sex,
[08:56.680 --> 09:00.460]  we are going to put them back on an 18-6 light cycle,
[09:00.460 --> 09:03.580]  18 on, six hours off, or if you really want to,
[09:03.580 --> 09:07.460]  you can put them on a 24-hour on and zero off light cycle
[09:07.460 --> 09:09.860]  and they will go back into a vegetative stage.
[09:09.860 --> 09:11.820]  If you don't let them flower too long,
[09:11.820 --> 09:13.460]  if you're good at identifying the sex,
[09:13.460 --> 09:16.260]  as soon as you see that sex, that sex part,
[09:16.260 --> 09:18.060]  that male part, that female part,
[09:18.060 --> 09:21.580]  that is when you put them back into the vegetative stage.
[09:21.580 --> 09:24.440]  So that is a really quick way to determine sex
[09:24.440 --> 09:27.260]  of your plants if you've only got one room.
[09:27.260 --> 09:29.700]  If you have got two separate areas,
[09:29.700 --> 09:33.260]  here is the most ideal way or another really ideal way.
[09:33.260 --> 09:37.020]  This is the way that I myself personally sex my plants.
[09:37.020 --> 09:38.360]  In a commercial environment,
[09:38.360 --> 09:40.760]  I may pay for the lab testing to have those sent in
[09:40.760 --> 09:43.740]  just because that saves us a lot of time.
[09:43.740 --> 09:46.580]  The week that it takes us to send and get that test back
[09:46.580 --> 09:49.020]  is well worth the two weeks that it takes us to find out
[09:49.020 --> 09:50.860]  if they're males or females and flower.
[09:50.860 --> 09:53.360]  So we'll just do the little, the rub test, send them in.
[09:53.360 --> 09:54.220]  That is very quick.
[09:54.220 --> 09:57.580]  But here's how I do it in my personal grow.
[09:57.580 --> 09:59.260]  If you've got a clone and a flower
[09:59.260 --> 10:02.120]  or possibly two or three separate areas available,
[10:02.120 --> 10:03.720]  this is how I would do it.
[10:03.720 --> 10:05.280]  I would grow the plants.
[10:05.280 --> 10:07.520]  I would get them into that six inch net pot.
[10:07.520 --> 10:10.280]  Then as soon as they're big enough, maybe a one gallon pot,
[10:10.280 --> 10:12.400]  as soon as they are big enough to get one,
[10:12.400 --> 10:13.600]  maybe three clones.
[10:13.600 --> 10:15.160]  I don't know how good at cloning you are.
[10:15.160 --> 10:17.560]  If you're a really good cloner, take three clones.
[10:17.560 --> 10:20.000]  If you're not good at it, one clone should be good.
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.200]  Or if you're really good at it,
[10:21.200 --> 10:22.680]  I'm not sure what I said I'm talking.
[10:22.680 --> 10:23.660]  I don't have much notes here.
[10:23.660 --> 10:26.520]  So this is all freestyle, keep that in mind.
[10:26.520 --> 10:29.120]  If you are super good at cloning, take one clone.
[10:29.120 --> 10:31.240]  If you're not super good at it, take three.
[10:31.240 --> 10:32.960]  That way you've got a backup plan.
[10:32.960 --> 10:34.360]  I like to take the top.
[10:34.360 --> 10:37.000]  When that plant starts to grow, the main top will shoot out.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.040]  That is your first clone to take right there.
[10:39.040 --> 10:40.680]  So get a clone of that plant.
[10:40.680 --> 10:41.720]  Let it grow a little bit more
[10:41.720 --> 10:44.100]  and get the two very bottom branches as soon as,
[10:44.100 --> 10:45.880]  not the little shitty branches on the bottom,
[10:45.880 --> 10:47.520]  but the two main branches that are big enough
[10:47.520 --> 10:50.320]  to take a clone off of, clone those off of there.
[10:50.320 --> 10:52.200]  Now you've got three clones in the cloner.
[10:52.200 --> 10:54.400]  Now you've also got the original donor plant.
[10:54.400 --> 10:56.720]  We're gonna call that the donor plant at this time.
[10:56.720 --> 10:58.200]  These are all the same genetics.
[10:58.200 --> 10:59.120]  It's all the same thing.
[10:59.120 --> 11:01.160]  You've got the mother plant, the donor plant,
[11:02.000 --> 11:02.840]  and three clones.
[11:02.840 --> 11:03.960]  Now you've got an option.
[11:03.960 --> 11:07.880]  You can put the clone dome under a 12-12 light
[11:07.880 --> 11:11.480]  and those plants will show you sex in seven, 10, 12,
[11:11.480 --> 11:13.720]  maybe 14 days at the very latest.
[11:13.720 --> 11:16.080]  You've got little tiny clones in a clone dome.
[11:16.080 --> 11:17.580]  They're gonna start showing you sex.
[11:17.580 --> 11:20.040]  Now you can say, you gotta label your clones.
[11:20.040 --> 11:21.920]  You got plant A, plant B, plant C.
[11:21.920 --> 11:24.120]  You gotta label your clones A, B, and C.
[11:24.120 --> 11:26.820]  Now if clone A shows you that it's female,
[11:26.820 --> 11:28.300]  plant A is a female.
[11:28.300 --> 11:30.200]  If clone B shows you that it's a male,
[11:30.200 --> 11:31.720]  you gotta get rid of that clone.
[11:31.720 --> 11:32.700]  And unless you're breeding,
[11:32.700 --> 11:35.040]  plan on chucking some pollen, making some seeds,
[11:35.040 --> 11:37.280]  get rid of plant number B also.
[11:37.280 --> 11:38.240]  So that is a quick way.
[11:38.240 --> 11:41.820]  You can put that tray of clones directly under 12-12 lighting
[11:41.820 --> 11:45.020]  and it will let you know what is a male and female in there.
[11:45.020 --> 11:48.960]  Or another option, you can let those clones root.
[11:48.960 --> 11:50.480]  Let them develop roots.
[11:50.480 --> 11:52.100]  Pot them into some medium.
[11:52.100 --> 11:53.560]  If you wanna go right into beer cups
[11:53.560 --> 11:56.600]  or your six inch net pots or four inch square pots
[11:56.600 --> 11:58.760]  or one gallon pots, however you wanna do it,
[11:58.760 --> 11:59.840]  pot those bad dogs.
[11:59.840 --> 12:01.840]  By this time, your other plants are getting bigger.
[12:01.840 --> 12:04.240]  You've still got that donor plant, the mother plant,
[12:04.240 --> 12:05.640]  hanging out in the veg room.
[12:05.640 --> 12:06.920]  You've still got that bad bitch.
[12:06.920 --> 12:08.160]  It may need to be up-potted
[12:08.160 --> 12:10.240]  to a three or five gallon pot by now.
[12:10.240 --> 12:11.080]  It's getting bushy.
[12:11.080 --> 12:12.320]  It's giving you a couple of clones.
[12:12.320 --> 12:14.520]  You may need to clean up the bottom of it by now.
[12:14.520 --> 12:17.340]  So you've got these bigger plants and you've got clones.
[12:17.340 --> 12:19.000]  You can let the clones root
[12:19.000 --> 12:20.900]  and then you've got two options at this point.
[12:20.900 --> 12:23.040]  You can put those clones into dirt
[12:23.040 --> 12:25.960]  and put them under 12-12 and have a small crop.
[12:25.960 --> 12:27.560]  You can let them veg a little longer,
[12:27.560 --> 12:30.000]  put them under 12-12 and have a small crop.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.240]  Or if you're sure they're all gonna live,
[12:32.240 --> 12:34.600]  you've got one of plant A, one of plant B,
[12:34.600 --> 12:36.520]  one of plant C, one of all of your plants.
[12:36.520 --> 12:38.840]  If you did a 10 pack of seeds, you got all 10 of them.
[12:38.840 --> 12:40.720]  You got a clone of all 10 in the cloner.
[12:40.720 --> 12:42.840]  You got all 10 of these big plants over here.
[12:42.840 --> 12:45.540]  That's when you can decide to move those bigger plants
[12:45.540 --> 12:48.160]  into the flower room and keep those clones back
[12:48.160 --> 12:50.680]  as your mother plants or your genetic preserve,
[12:50.680 --> 12:51.840]  if that's what you wanna call it.
[12:51.840 --> 12:53.680]  That's your new nursery.
[12:53.680 --> 12:55.840]  Those will become your new mother plants.
[12:55.840 --> 12:59.080]  Some people really like to have that plant
[12:59.080 --> 13:02.120]  that came from seed as their keeper mother plant.
[13:02.120 --> 13:04.200]  They want that original plant that sprouted
[13:04.200 --> 13:06.040]  from the seed as their keeper.
[13:06.040 --> 13:09.520]  Other people don't mind keeping a clone of it as the keeper.
[13:09.520 --> 13:11.540]  I don't see a problem either way.
[13:11.540 --> 13:13.200]  The way that I do it, I'll tell you how I do it.
[13:13.200 --> 13:15.880]  I cut the top, I put that top in the cloner.
[13:15.880 --> 13:17.920]  As soon as I see roots on that bad bitch,
[13:17.920 --> 13:20.440]  I move the other plants into the flowering room.
[13:20.440 --> 13:21.280]  They're gonna flower.
[13:21.280 --> 13:24.440]  It's gonna take them about 12-14 days to kick into flower.
[13:24.440 --> 13:26.120]  It'll take about the same amount of time
[13:26.120 --> 13:28.080]  for my clones over here to make roots.
[13:28.080 --> 13:29.760]  So by the time they're in flower,
[13:29.760 --> 13:31.880]  they're kicking out flowers, they're pre-flowers,
[13:31.880 --> 13:34.360]  these plants are ready to go into their beer cups
[13:34.360 --> 13:35.760]  or six-inch net pots.
[13:35.760 --> 13:37.440]  Now I've got a copy of everything
[13:37.440 --> 13:38.940]  that I just moved into the flower room.
[13:38.940 --> 13:40.600]  I've got a fresh copy of it.
[13:40.600 --> 13:42.380]  Now I know what the males and females are
[13:42.380 --> 13:45.020]  because in a few days, these big plants,
[13:45.020 --> 13:47.520]  in about 12-14 days, these big plants are gonna show me
[13:47.520 --> 13:49.180]  what are males and females.
[13:49.180 --> 13:50.740]  I'll chop down those bigger plants.
[13:50.740 --> 13:52.400]  They're not as big as some people would've let them go
[13:52.400 --> 13:54.680]  by now, but now I'll chop down those big plants,
[13:54.680 --> 13:56.160]  crowd all the others together,
[13:56.160 --> 13:57.600]  and then I'll get rid of those cups.
[13:57.600 --> 13:58.640]  But that is the way I do it.
[13:58.640 --> 14:00.600]  I put the bigger ones into the flower room
[14:00.600 --> 14:02.080]  because they're already bigger.
[14:02.080 --> 14:03.560]  They're already ready already.
[14:03.560 --> 14:04.760]  Why am I gonna wait?
[14:04.760 --> 14:07.840]  I don't insist on having that rooted seed plant
[14:07.840 --> 14:08.680]  as the mother.
[14:08.680 --> 14:09.500]  I use a clone.
[14:09.500 --> 14:12.420]  I use that clone will go into the mother room.
[14:12.420 --> 14:13.400]  It'll get bigger.
[14:13.400 --> 14:14.840]  I'll cut clones from it.
[14:14.840 --> 14:16.040]  And then guess what?
[14:16.040 --> 14:17.280]  It goes into the flower room.
[14:17.280 --> 14:20.000]  Just generation after generation of cutting clones
[14:20.000 --> 14:20.820]  into the flower room.
[14:21.140 --> 14:22.540]  Sexting, the way that I do it.
[14:22.540 --> 14:23.620]  Let me recap.
[14:23.620 --> 14:24.940]  I pot my seeds.
[14:24.940 --> 14:26.380]  I grow them.
[14:26.380 --> 14:28.220]  As soon as they're big enough to get a clone,
[14:28.220 --> 14:29.380]  I get a clone.
[14:29.380 --> 14:32.920]  I put that plant now goes into a three gallon pot.
[14:32.920 --> 14:34.240]  I've probably got 10 of them now.
[14:34.240 --> 14:36.500]  I move all 10 of those into the flower room.
[14:36.500 --> 14:39.600]  I have my thing, my cloner filled with 10 clones.
[14:39.600 --> 14:40.540]  These start to flower.
[14:40.540 --> 14:41.700]  These start to root.
[14:41.700 --> 14:44.100]  I will know in about 10-14 days
[14:44.100 --> 14:45.640]  if these are males or females.
[14:45.640 --> 14:48.300]  I'll pull the males and I'll pull the corresponding clones.
[14:48.300 --> 14:50.560]  Now these are in flower and I've got more plants
[14:51.300 --> 14:53.160]  that are working as mother slash veg plants
[14:53.160 --> 14:54.660]  to keep my cycles going.
[14:54.660 --> 14:56.480]  I'm already in flower with one batch
[14:56.480 --> 14:58.240]  and I've already set up for veg
[14:58.240 --> 15:00.160]  and mother plants for the next batch.
[15:00.160 --> 15:01.680]  That is the way that I do sexting.
[15:01.680 --> 15:03.040]  Let me check my notes.
[15:03.040 --> 15:04.960]  I went really quickly and I didn't look
[15:04.960 --> 15:06.280]  at the notes very much.
[15:07.120 --> 15:09.800]  Run the clone, run the big plant.
[15:09.800 --> 15:11.880]  Deciding, so deciding which one you wanna run
[15:11.880 --> 15:13.480]  and what to keep is your strategy,
[15:13.480 --> 15:15.400]  but I just told you which one I do.
[15:15.400 --> 15:17.040]  I put the big one into flower
[15:17.040 --> 15:18.680]  because it's already ready already.
[15:18.680 --> 15:19.880]  We've been vegging it.
[15:20.040 --> 15:21.320]  Hopefully you've been taking care of it
[15:21.320 --> 15:23.640]  for the whole time that the other clones have been rooting.
[15:23.640 --> 15:25.440]  So that's the way that,
[15:25.440 --> 15:27.320]  if you are waiting for those clones to root.
[15:27.320 --> 15:28.160]  That's what I wanna touch on.
[15:28.160 --> 15:30.080]  If you're not really good at cloning,
[15:30.080 --> 15:32.600]  if you're not super successful with your clones,
[15:32.600 --> 15:35.360]  maybe wait until these clones make roots
[15:35.360 --> 15:38.460]  before you move these other plants into the flower room.
[15:38.460 --> 15:41.240]  If you do it too early, you can take clones from plants
[15:41.240 --> 15:43.440]  that are early into flower, but I don't recommend it.
[15:43.440 --> 15:47.340]  It makes some things go wonky, but just wait, just hold off.
[15:47.340 --> 15:49.980]  Don't move these into flower until these have roots
[15:49.980 --> 15:51.620]  is a good part of the strategy.
[15:51.620 --> 15:53.620]  But that big plant is already vegged out.
[15:53.620 --> 15:57.140]  So generally I will move that into the flowering room.
[15:57.140 --> 15:59.460]  A lot of people do prefer, like I said,
[15:59.460 --> 16:02.840]  to keep that original seeded plant as the mother plant.
[16:02.840 --> 16:05.980]  However, I don't find it necessary.
[16:05.980 --> 16:07.620]  As long as your clone cutting technique
[16:07.620 --> 16:09.460]  and clone care is good,
[16:09.460 --> 16:11.660]  you'll still have those solid genetics forever.
[16:11.660 --> 16:13.980]  You'll be able to move that original seed in there.
[16:13.980 --> 16:16.380]  You got your clones, put that clone into a pot,
[16:16.820 --> 16:20.060]  cut clones from that, repeat that cycle.
[16:20.060 --> 16:22.580]  That's how you get a nice perpetual grow going.
[16:22.580 --> 16:23.940]  All right, taking a look at the notes,
[16:23.940 --> 16:26.300]  I think I covered everything.
[16:26.300 --> 16:27.700]  Yes, all right, we covered all of that.
[16:27.700 --> 16:30.100]  That is how I sex my plants early.
[16:30.100 --> 16:32.180]  The reason for doing this, like I said earlier,
[16:32.180 --> 16:34.940]  so you don't end up with a plant that you have scrogged out
[16:34.940 --> 16:37.540]  and done a bunch of work to it for weeks and weeks and weeks
[16:37.540 --> 16:39.360]  and then you find out that you've got a male.
[16:39.360 --> 16:42.300]  If you've got a scrog, you've got a scrog net all filled up.
[16:42.300 --> 16:44.340]  When you cut out that one plant out of that net,
[16:44.340 --> 16:46.540]  you got a whole bunch of empty, wasted space.
[16:46.540 --> 16:49.140]  You could have just found out if you had males or females.
[16:49.140 --> 16:50.860]  Maybe it does slow you down a little bit.
[16:50.860 --> 16:52.120]  Maybe it is an extra step,
[16:52.120 --> 16:55.140]  but these extra steps are what set us up for success.
[16:55.140 --> 16:56.620]  We have to do these extra steps.
[16:56.620 --> 16:58.220]  Keep in mind, I say this a lot
[16:58.220 --> 17:00.320]  when I talk about pheno hunting and sexing.
[17:01.460 --> 17:04.560]  This isn't the last run with these genetics.
[17:04.560 --> 17:06.020]  This is the very first run.
[17:06.020 --> 17:07.300]  We are learning here.
[17:07.300 --> 17:10.260]  Also, hopefully this is not your last crop.
[17:10.260 --> 17:11.100]  You're just learning here
[17:11.100 --> 17:12.820]  we're going to get to run these plants
[17:12.820 --> 17:14.260]  again and again and again.
[17:14.260 --> 17:15.180]  And the more you run them,
[17:15.180 --> 17:17.320]  the more you're going to get more comfortable with them.
[17:17.320 --> 17:18.340]  What do you do?
[17:18.340 --> 17:19.180]  What's your job?
[17:19.180 --> 17:20.000]  Where do you go?
[17:20.000 --> 17:20.840]  What do you do all day?
[17:20.840 --> 17:21.660]  What's your hobby?
[17:21.660 --> 17:23.500]  What's something that suit to some people?
[17:23.500 --> 17:24.460]  What is something you do
[17:24.460 --> 17:26.500]  that would probably scare the shit out of them?
[17:26.500 --> 17:28.460]  I've grown cannabis for,
[17:28.460 --> 17:29.940]  let's not even talk about how many years
[17:29.940 --> 17:30.780]  I've been doing that.
[17:30.780 --> 17:31.940]  Some of them may be illegal.
[17:31.940 --> 17:34.580]  I've also been playing the drums since I was a teenager.
[17:34.580 --> 17:37.220]  I'm about to turn 42 years old, I think.
[17:37.220 --> 17:39.100]  I got drums for my 14th birthday.
[17:39.100 --> 17:40.380]  You do the math there.
[17:40.380 --> 17:42.500]  Something I could be really comfortable at.
[17:43.180 --> 17:45.660]  If we were at a club and a rock and roll band said,
[17:45.660 --> 17:47.580]  hey, our drummer just cannot play.
[17:47.580 --> 17:48.680]  I'm not even going to kill the drummer.
[17:48.680 --> 17:50.740]  In my mind, I said, our drummer.
[17:50.740 --> 17:52.380]  See, my mouth won't even let me say it.
[17:52.380 --> 17:54.940]  In my mind, I was going to say, our drummer just died.
[17:54.940 --> 17:56.820]  And then they're like, we need a drummer that could play.
[17:56.820 --> 17:58.820]  I just put my hands up and go, you got sticks, bro?
[17:58.820 --> 18:00.340]  Is there sticks in a drum set?
[18:00.340 --> 18:01.700]  I can fill in for that.
[18:01.700 --> 18:04.460]  A lot of people would just completely shit their pants.
[18:04.460 --> 18:06.180]  They're not comfortable walking up on stage
[18:06.180 --> 18:07.020]  and going, I'll do this.
[18:07.020 --> 18:07.900]  What songs are we going to play?
[18:07.900 --> 18:10.020]  Kind of hum the song at me and we'll play it.
[18:10.020 --> 18:11.740]  Like I have no problem doing that.
[18:11.940 --> 18:12.780]  That's cool.
[18:12.780 --> 18:13.600]  That's something I'm fine with.
[18:13.600 --> 18:14.740]  But a lot of people, I say,
[18:14.740 --> 18:16.500]  go get up on that stage and play the drums.
[18:16.500 --> 18:17.380]  They just start shitting.
[18:17.380 --> 18:18.260]  They start sweating.
[18:18.260 --> 18:19.100]  They get shaky.
[18:19.100 --> 18:19.940]  They get nervous.
[18:19.940 --> 18:20.980]  That is where I shine.
[18:20.980 --> 18:24.180]  So you will be that way in the grow room over time.
[18:24.180 --> 18:26.980]  Grow a few crops, read a lot about your plants,
[18:26.980 --> 18:27.820]  kill a few plants.
[18:27.820 --> 18:30.100]  You're going to have to fuck up a few plants to learn.
[18:30.100 --> 18:31.060]  How do you know their limits?
[18:31.060 --> 18:32.580]  How do you know what they can and cannot take
[18:32.580 --> 18:34.780]  if you don't push a few of them to their limits?
[18:34.780 --> 18:36.580]  So get in there and do it.
[18:36.580 --> 18:38.500]  And then you'll get as comfortable as I am in the grow.
[18:38.500 --> 18:40.060]  The reason I'm so comfortable
[18:40.060 --> 18:42.500]  is because I've been doing it every single day
[18:42.500 --> 18:44.320]  for longer than I should admit.
[18:44.320 --> 18:46.420]  I talked about earlier on a podcast with Mike
[18:46.420 --> 18:47.740]  on the previous episode,
[18:47.740 --> 18:49.940]  we had a dispensary in 2008.
[18:49.940 --> 18:54.100]  I was growing on a commercial level in 2007 and 2008.
[18:54.100 --> 18:57.300]  That's how many plants, crops, run cycles.
[18:57.300 --> 18:58.600]  That's how long I've been doing this.
[18:58.600 --> 18:59.880]  So that's why I'm so comfortable.
[18:59.880 --> 19:01.140]  And you'll get there too.
[19:01.140 --> 19:03.700]  Just get in the grow, learn, read, pay attention,
[19:03.700 --> 19:07.420]  take notes, be passionate, be mindful and have purpose.
[19:07.420 --> 19:09.060]  Anything you're doing in that garden,
[19:09.060 --> 19:10.700]  have purpose for what you're doing.
[19:10.700 --> 19:12.300]  Don't do it because,
[19:12.300 --> 19:14.060]  don't do it because Rasta Jeff said so.
[19:14.060 --> 19:16.660]  Don't do it because somebody else on the internet said so.
[19:16.660 --> 19:18.780]  Don't do it because your brother's uncle's cousin did it
[19:18.780 --> 19:20.240]  and got good results.
[19:20.240 --> 19:23.420]  Be mindful, be thoughtful, have a strategy,
[19:23.420 --> 19:24.740]  know why and what you're doing.
[19:24.740 --> 19:27.560]  And think about whatever you do today in the garden
[19:27.560 --> 19:29.220]  isn't going to, you'll see it today.
[19:29.220 --> 19:30.620]  If you get in there and do some silly shit,
[19:30.620 --> 19:31.580]  you may see it today,
[19:31.580 --> 19:33.700]  but really you're not gonna see results.
[19:33.700 --> 19:37.900]  Think about the results in three, five, seven, 10, 14, 21,
[19:37.900 --> 19:38.840]  30 days from now.
[19:39.620 --> 19:40.440]  Think about what it's going to do
[19:40.440 --> 19:42.040]  to the top and bottom of the plant.
[19:42.040 --> 19:44.880]  How will it affect the overall performance
[19:44.880 --> 19:46.040]  of the entire crop?
[19:46.040 --> 19:47.160]  Not just this one plant.
[19:47.160 --> 19:49.240]  Is it good for the whole fucking grow room?
[19:49.240 --> 19:50.840]  Pay attention to things like that.
[19:50.840 --> 19:53.440]  Have a lot of forethought, have some strategy
[19:53.440 --> 19:55.160]  when you're in there playing around in the grow.
[19:55.160 --> 19:56.280]  Yeah, when you top the plants,
[19:56.280 --> 19:57.640]  you're gonna see that today.
[19:57.640 --> 19:59.360]  If you drop a light on it and crush a plant,
[19:59.360 --> 20:00.640]  you'll see that today.
[20:00.640 --> 20:02.640]  Foliar feed, you may not notice that
[20:02.640 --> 20:06.160]  until the lights come on tomorrow or the next light cycle.
[20:06.160 --> 20:08.220]  If you overfed some weird nutrient,
[20:08.620 --> 20:09.740]  if you didn't pH properly,
[20:09.740 --> 20:12.020]  that's slowly going to progress over time.
[20:12.020 --> 20:13.220]  That's why we take a lot of notes
[20:13.220 --> 20:14.580]  and pay a lot of attention.
[20:14.580 --> 20:18.420]  But think about all of the shit you do to your plants today,
[20:18.420 --> 20:21.260]  you may not notice any outcome for two to three days.
[20:21.260 --> 20:23.460]  So if you're going to do several things to the plants,
[20:23.460 --> 20:25.620]  maybe space those out by a few days
[20:25.620 --> 20:28.300]  so that you know what is working and what is not working.
[20:28.300 --> 20:29.700]  Have some sort of control,
[20:29.700 --> 20:31.980]  have some standard operating procedures,
[20:31.980 --> 20:33.560]  some sort of strategy here.
[20:33.560 --> 20:34.500]  That's what I'm talking about.
[20:34.500 --> 20:36.180]  All right, I've got one more thing I wanna talk about
[20:36.180 --> 20:37.780]  before we start wrapping up this podcast.
[20:38.340 --> 20:39.740]  I did get quite chatty today.
[20:39.740 --> 20:40.620]  Where are we gonna go?
[20:40.620 --> 20:42.340]  Oh, this question is,
[20:42.340 --> 20:46.380]  can I keep a fem seed as a mother plant?
[20:46.380 --> 20:48.760]  Yes, the quick answer to that is yes.
[20:48.760 --> 20:50.500]  I see that on the internet a lot.
[20:50.500 --> 20:52.240]  People are talking about feminized seeds
[20:52.240 --> 20:54.640]  being inferior to regular seeds.
[20:54.640 --> 20:57.460]  People talk about they are prone to hermaphroditism,
[20:57.460 --> 20:59.700]  that you can't keep them as a mother plant.
[20:59.700 --> 21:02.260]  My question is, why couldn't you keep
[21:02.260 --> 21:05.680]  a feminized seed as a mother plant?
[21:05.680 --> 21:08.160]  It grows just like a regular seed.
[21:08.160 --> 21:10.820]  Other than that plant not containing,
[21:10.820 --> 21:12.560]  that seed never hit, that seed,
[21:12.560 --> 21:15.520]  that female plant never got any male pollen.
[21:15.520 --> 21:16.900]  There are no male chromosomes.
[21:16.900 --> 21:18.580]  Other than that male chromosome,
[21:18.580 --> 21:22.640]  there's no difference than any other seed, any other plant.
[21:22.640 --> 21:25.240]  It's a female plant, it's a cannabis plant.
[21:25.240 --> 21:30.240]  A lot of my great crosses are made from feminized seeds.
[21:30.880 --> 21:33.640]  So you can keep a mother plant of a fem seed.
[21:33.640 --> 21:34.800]  And the next question is,
[21:34.800 --> 21:37.320]  can you breed with a feminized mother plant?
[21:37.320 --> 21:38.920]  Absolutely you can.
[21:38.920 --> 21:40.820]  Let's talk about morning dew.
[21:40.820 --> 21:43.920]  Morning dew, the grateful dog was a feminized seed.
[21:43.920 --> 21:47.320]  I made a feminized plant, it was the grateful dog.
[21:47.320 --> 21:50.600]  That grateful dog gets pollinated by an arise male.
[21:50.600 --> 21:55.320]  The seeds that come from that are morning dew regular seeds.
[21:55.320 --> 21:59.220]  That grateful dog plant is kept as a mother plant.
[21:59.220 --> 22:01.600]  I've got to keep it perpetually if I want to cross to it.
[22:01.600 --> 22:03.460]  I've got a few things that I cross to it,
[22:03.460 --> 22:04.860]  so it's got to stick around.
[22:04.860 --> 22:05.980]  So I do keep a mother.
[22:05.980 --> 22:09.060]  It is a feminized seed and I keep a mother of it constantly.
[22:09.060 --> 22:10.620]  That is one that is always in the garden.
[22:10.620 --> 22:13.220]  It's been there since the,
[22:13.220 --> 22:15.100]  we're not even gonna say how long that's been around,
[22:15.100 --> 22:16.440]  probably 2008-ish.
[22:16.440 --> 22:19.300]  I think that's been in the garden, 2008, 2009.
[22:19.300 --> 22:20.740]  That one's been around for quite a while,
[22:20.740 --> 22:22.100]  that exact version of it.
[22:23.660 --> 22:27.660]  So yes, you can keep a feminized seed as a mother plant.
[22:27.660 --> 22:30.100]  It is no different than all of your other plants.
[22:30.100 --> 22:32.540]  The only difference is it was a feminized seed.
[22:32.540 --> 22:35.220]  Once it grows, it is the same exact thing.
[22:35.220 --> 22:37.940]  If it was done correctly, it works just like
[22:37.940 --> 22:38.900]  any other plant.
[22:38.900 --> 22:40.100]  The next part of that question was,
[22:40.100 --> 22:42.740]  can I breed to that feminized mother plant?
[22:42.740 --> 22:44.140]  Yes, absolutely.
[22:44.980 --> 22:48.620]  Morning dew comes from a feminized female plant.
[22:48.620 --> 22:52.340]  Lemon sunrise comes, lemon jeffery is feminized seeds.
[22:52.340 --> 22:54.420]  Lemon jeff is only available in fem seeds
[22:54.420 --> 22:56.860]  because the golden goat is only clone only,
[22:56.860 --> 22:58.620]  so there's no male, so I've got to reverse it
[22:58.620 --> 23:00.060]  to make the lemon jeffery.
[23:00.060 --> 23:03.240]  So lemon jeffery is only available in fem seeds.
[23:03.240 --> 23:04.700]  You guys have noticed that I make
[23:04.700 --> 23:07.100]  lemon sunrise regular seeds.
[23:07.100 --> 23:09.980]  That is the arise to the lemon jeffery.
[23:09.980 --> 23:13.020]  So that is a breeding project of a feminized plant
[23:13.020 --> 23:15.140]  that is pollinated by a regular male,
[23:15.140 --> 23:18.260]  and it just makes regular male, female seeds.
[23:18.260 --> 23:22.440]  So to wrap that up, you absolutely can keep a female,
[23:22.440 --> 23:24.580]  a feminized plant as a mother,
[23:24.580 --> 23:27.580]  and you can absolutely breed and outbreed
[23:27.580 --> 23:30.020]  two feminized plants.
[23:30.020 --> 23:32.260]  All right, you guys, I think that was about 30 minutes.
[23:32.260 --> 23:34.060]  I want to thank you guys for hanging out with me.

[24:29.300 --> 24:31.500]  We ask you a few preliminary questions,
[24:31.500 --> 24:32.700]  I guess you can call them,
[24:32.700 --> 24:34.460]  kind of screen you a little bit.
[24:34.460 --> 24:36.900]  We added a tab where you can include a photo.
[24:36.900 --> 24:38.300]  So you ask your questions.
[24:38.300 --> 24:41.700]  I will look at the photos and answer your questions
[24:41.700 --> 24:43.980]  here on the podcast.
