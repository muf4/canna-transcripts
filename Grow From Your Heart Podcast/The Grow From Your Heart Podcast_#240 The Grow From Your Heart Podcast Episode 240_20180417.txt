[01:20.420 --> 01:21.420]  I'm your host.
[01:21.420 --> 01:22.420]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:22.420 --> 01:23.420]  I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[01:23.420 --> 01:24.860]  Let's drop down that music a little bit.
[01:24.860 --> 01:26.180]  We're getting carried away already today.
[01:26.180 --> 01:28.460]  Dude, I said 99 and it blew my mind.
[01:28.460 --> 01:29.460]  99, man.
[01:29.460 --> 01:30.460]  Wow.
[01:30.460 --> 01:31.460]  I mean, congratulations.
[01:31.460 --> 01:32.460]  Yes.
[01:32.460 --> 01:33.460]  Congratulations.
[01:33.460 --> 01:34.460]  Thank you.
[01:34.460 --> 01:35.460]  Well, that means the next one is 100.
[01:35.460 --> 01:36.460]  We're just going to party it up.
[01:36.460 --> 01:37.460]  I know.
[01:37.460 --> 01:38.460]  Yeah.
[01:38.460 --> 01:39.460]  Cool.
[01:39.460 --> 01:40.460]  Well, I'm honored to have our guest with us.
[01:40.460 --> 01:42.180]  Sitting in front of me is a regular guest, a frequent guest.
[01:42.620 --> 01:43.620]  How many episodes have you been on lately, bro?
[01:43.620 --> 01:44.620]  A bunch in a row.
[01:44.620 --> 01:45.620]  A bunch in a row.
[01:45.620 --> 01:46.620]  Well, thanks for coming back.
[01:46.620 --> 01:47.620]  We got our buddy, White Mike, over there.
[01:47.620 --> 01:48.620]  What's up, everybody?
[01:48.620 --> 01:49.620]  Looking good on Mike too.
[01:49.620 --> 01:51.700]  And sitting to my left is a good friend of mine.
[01:51.700 --> 01:54.100]  I'm actually Doug's medical marijuana caregiver.
[01:54.100 --> 01:56.420]  Welcome to the show, my good buddy, Doug.
[01:56.420 --> 01:57.420]  Thank you very much.
[01:57.420 --> 01:58.900]  I wish we had some crowd noise for that.
[01:58.900 --> 01:59.900]  Yeah.
[01:59.900 --> 02:00.900]  Yeah.
[02:00.900 --> 02:01.900]  Well, thanks for coming, Doug.
[02:01.900 --> 02:02.900]  My pleasure.
[02:02.900 --> 02:04.820]  Doug's a good friend of mine.
[02:04.820 --> 02:06.860]  I am his caregiver.
[02:06.860 --> 02:12.820]  And our topic for the show is going to be the way that different ways of consuming your
[02:12.820 --> 02:16.700]  cannabinoids, the way of using your cannabis, the way taking your medicine differently affects
[02:16.700 --> 02:20.740]  your mind and your body, and maybe even your spirit a little bit differently.
[02:20.740 --> 02:23.740]  But before we get there, I'm going to brag a little bit.
[02:23.740 --> 02:24.740]  Yeah, buddy.
[02:24.740 --> 02:25.740]  Yeah.
[02:25.740 --> 02:29.420]  I know we've been talking about the spot dispensary a whole bunch on this podcast.
[02:29.420 --> 02:30.420]  Because it's awesome.
[02:30.420 --> 02:33.900]  Mike and I spend 132 hours per week there.
[02:33.900 --> 02:34.900]  Ish.
[02:34.900 --> 02:35.900]  Ish.
[02:36.900 --> 02:38.860]  And it's a great spot to be.
[02:38.860 --> 02:39.860]  It's a great place to be.
[02:39.860 --> 02:40.860]  I think that's what I meant to say.
[02:40.860 --> 02:41.860]  Whatever.
[02:41.860 --> 02:42.860]  It's a great spot to be in.
[02:42.860 --> 02:46.980]  But anyway, yesterday, we were wrapping up work.
[02:46.980 --> 02:50.340]  And the boss walked up to me and he said, mandatory meeting today, five o'clock at the
[02:50.340 --> 02:51.780]  Pueblo Convention Center.
[02:51.780 --> 02:52.780]  And I smiled and I said, really?
[02:52.780 --> 02:56.500]  And he goes, yeah, put on your Sundays because we're in the top three.
[02:56.500 --> 03:01.060]  So we get there and it was the best of Pueblo Convention.
[03:01.060 --> 03:04.260]  And our spot won the best dispensary in Pueblo.
[03:04.260 --> 03:05.260]  We took first place.
[03:05.620 --> 03:06.620]  We got the gold.
[03:06.620 --> 03:07.620]  Yep.
[03:07.620 --> 03:08.620]  Anybody can vote.
[03:08.620 --> 03:12.220]  It's a local competition for, I think there are 180 categories this year ranging from
[03:12.220 --> 03:18.620]  like best teacher to best cop to best bakery, best lawyer, best hairdresser.
[03:18.620 --> 03:20.500]  And we won best dispensary.
[03:20.500 --> 03:21.500]  Yep.
[03:21.500 --> 03:22.500]  Best dispensary.
[03:22.500 --> 03:26.260]  So we've got a little gold plaque in the office and we are going to be well advertised.
[03:26.260 --> 03:27.660]  And now we've got something to brag about.
[03:27.660 --> 03:29.660]  And our picture's in the paper today.
[03:29.660 --> 03:30.660]  For our picture.
[03:30.660 --> 03:31.660]  Yeah, we have a really cool picture.
[03:31.660 --> 03:33.780]  We took a picture in front of the Bob Marley mural.
[03:33.780 --> 03:34.780]  Nice big team picture.
[03:35.300 --> 03:36.300]  We got everybody out there.
[03:36.300 --> 03:37.300]  It's a colorful shot.
[03:37.300 --> 03:38.300]  Eight in the morning.
[03:38.300 --> 03:39.300]  Eight in the morning taking a picture.
[03:39.300 --> 03:40.300]  A bunch of people that work at a dispensary.
[03:40.300 --> 03:43.860]  And for those that weren't aware that you were the best, now they know.
[03:43.860 --> 03:44.860]  Now they know.
[03:44.860 --> 03:46.140]  And we've got a year to brag about that.
[03:46.140 --> 03:47.140]  Yep.
[03:47.140 --> 03:48.140]  One whole year.
[03:48.140 --> 03:49.140]  All right.
[03:49.140 --> 03:50.740]  Well, let's get into the, where I'm done bragging.
[03:50.740 --> 03:51.900]  Big shout out to Rob at the spot.
[03:51.900 --> 03:53.500]  Big shout out to the whole team at the spot.
[03:53.500 --> 03:55.260]  Everybody that does everything they do.
[03:55.260 --> 04:01.020]  The grow team, the bud team, the trimming team, the bud tenting crew, all the managers,
[04:01.020 --> 04:02.100]  everybody that signs the paychecks.
[04:02.100 --> 04:04.180]  Big shout out to everybody that's involved at the spot.
[04:04.580 --> 04:05.580]  I like working there.
[04:05.580 --> 04:07.940]  You guys are kick ass and let's keep kicking ass, you guys.
[04:07.940 --> 04:08.940]  Well done, everybody.
[04:08.940 --> 04:09.940]  Yeah.
[04:09.940 --> 04:12.820]  Let's get off the tootin' horn and advertising our work all the time on the show.
[04:12.820 --> 04:14.620]  Not a way we're really here today.
[04:14.620 --> 04:15.620]  Yeah.
[04:15.620 --> 04:21.540]  So these two guys, I've been responsible for their medical marijuana for over five years
[04:21.540 --> 04:23.380]  that I can say for sure, without a doubt.
[04:23.380 --> 04:24.380]  Yeah.
[04:24.380 --> 04:25.380]  Probably closer.
[04:25.380 --> 04:26.380]  Five or six years.
[04:26.380 --> 04:27.380]  Okay.
[04:27.380 --> 04:28.660]  I was going to say closer to eight or 10 maybe even.
[04:28.660 --> 04:29.660]  It's getting there.
[04:29.660 --> 04:30.660]  It's getting there.
[04:30.660 --> 04:31.660]  Okay.
[04:31.660 --> 04:32.660]  Yeah.
[04:32.660 --> 04:33.660]  I don't have a good sense of time.
[04:34.140 --> 04:35.140]  I don't know if I remember.
[04:35.140 --> 04:37.340]  I used to remember time periods by what fish shows I went to.
[04:37.340 --> 04:38.340]  Yeah.
[04:38.340 --> 04:41.140]  I've been to a lot of fish shows, you guys.
[04:41.140 --> 04:44.980]  I used to document, yeah, how much time I was spending places.
[04:44.980 --> 04:45.980]  All right.
[04:45.980 --> 04:50.220]  So I've been responsible for these guys' medical marijuana and I have noticed that when Mike
[04:50.220 --> 04:53.820]  wants to get high, he wants to smoke some sativa, like some jelly bean that we just
[04:53.820 --> 04:55.700]  took dabs of or some golden goat.
[04:55.700 --> 04:58.900]  But when Mike needs medicine, he reaches for the heavy CBD.
[04:58.900 --> 05:00.060]  I got this jar over here.
[05:00.060 --> 05:01.060]  I don't know if either one of you would like a dab of this.
[05:01.060 --> 05:02.060]  I'm a big CBD fan.
[05:02.060 --> 05:05.300]  Crystal clear honey oil.
[05:05.300 --> 05:08.060]  That's almost pure CBD that was given to me by a friend of ours.
[05:08.060 --> 05:09.060]  We're both staring at you.
[05:09.060 --> 05:10.060]  Yeah.
[05:10.060 --> 05:11.060]  Drooling.
[05:11.060 --> 05:15.100]  When these guys, excuse me for the cough, when these guys are hurting, when they feel
[05:15.100 --> 05:18.860]  pain, they hit me up and they're like, do you have something extra CBD for me right
[05:18.860 --> 05:19.860]  now?
[05:19.860 --> 05:22.500]  Because Mike's got sore hands.
[05:22.500 --> 05:24.020]  Doug was an old railroad worker over here.
[05:24.020 --> 05:25.020]  You got to picture this guy.
[05:25.020 --> 05:28.500]  He's in jeans and a flannel shirt with a big ass knife on his belt.
[05:28.500 --> 05:30.820]  This man looks like he is ready to do some work.
[05:30.820 --> 05:34.740]  Whatever you need done, I'm sure and confident Doug can handle that work.
[05:34.740 --> 05:36.740]  I would certainly give it a shot.
[05:36.740 --> 05:37.740]  Yeah.
[05:37.740 --> 05:39.740]  I'm sure you'd get it done a little better than myself.
[05:39.740 --> 05:43.220]  Well, you know, maybe depending on what it was.
[05:43.220 --> 05:44.220]  That's true.
[05:44.220 --> 05:45.220]  That is true.
[05:45.220 --> 05:47.220]  There are some things that I bet I could do, but Doug's a confident man.
[05:47.220 --> 05:50.780]  He can work, but he's an old railroad guy and so he's pretty much broken all over the
[05:50.780 --> 05:51.780]  place.
[05:51.780 --> 05:52.780]  Broken all over the place.
[05:52.780 --> 05:53.780]  Yeah.
[05:53.780 --> 05:56.420]  Back, knees, all the joints, all the joints are in bad shape.
[05:56.540 --> 05:59.580]  And that AGE has got a little bit to do with it.
[05:59.580 --> 06:01.220]  You know, yeah, well, yeah, you're getting a little bit up there.
[06:01.220 --> 06:03.340]  Do you mind if I ask you how old you are on the show, my friend?
[06:03.340 --> 06:04.340]  Not at all.
[06:04.340 --> 06:05.340]  I'm 61 years old.
[06:05.340 --> 06:09.220]  So my friend Doug is 61 and medical cannabis is keeping this dude moving.
[06:09.220 --> 06:12.940]  When he hurts, we give him some CBD.
[06:12.940 --> 06:13.940]  Do you have a favorite?
[06:13.940 --> 06:14.940]  We're just going to kind of jump into this part.
[06:14.940 --> 06:21.140]  Do you have a favorite way to consume your CBD medicine?
[06:21.140 --> 06:25.820]  My favorite way to consume is with my little electric pen.
[06:26.220 --> 06:30.020]  My old lady calls it the pacifier because it's always around my neck.
[06:30.020 --> 06:31.740]  It's hanging on your neck on a lanyard.
[06:31.740 --> 06:33.460]  You never know when you're going to need it.
[06:33.460 --> 06:35.660]  And it's one of the most resin coated.
[06:35.660 --> 06:39.460]  You can tell that that thing has been around the block.
[06:39.460 --> 06:45.340]  Well, you know, it had to have a little extra work done to it because those glass tops just
[06:45.340 --> 06:46.340]  don't work for me.
[06:46.340 --> 06:47.340]  Oh yeah.
[06:47.340 --> 06:49.740]  I know how you get been a little modified there.
[06:49.740 --> 06:53.300]  That's pretty custom, but it, but it works really good.
[06:53.300 --> 06:57.620]  It's there at a moment's notice.
[06:57.620 --> 07:03.420]  And it's the way that seems to, well, anytime you smoke it, we all know that that's the
[07:03.420 --> 07:05.860]  quickest way to get it.
[07:05.860 --> 07:11.540]  And when you're in pain and you want relief now, I find that's the quickest way.
[07:11.540 --> 07:15.380]  So what's going to hurt most frequently if we're hanging out, what are you going to say?
[07:15.380 --> 07:16.380]  Shit, this hurts.
[07:16.380 --> 07:17.380]  What are you going to grab first?
[07:17.380 --> 07:19.460]  My hip, your hip, my hip, my lower back.
[07:19.460 --> 07:20.460]  Okay.
[07:20.460 --> 07:22.420]  So then you're probably going to say shit that hurts.
[07:22.540 --> 07:24.740]  So my first thought is going to be, where's my vape pen, right?
[07:24.740 --> 07:25.740]  Exactly.
[07:25.740 --> 07:26.740]  How long from inhaling off?
[07:26.740 --> 07:27.740]  Okay.
[07:27.740 --> 07:31.140]  First, how many rips off that pen does it take to kind of give you a little relief to notice
[07:31.140 --> 07:34.540]  some easing of the pain to notice easing of the pain?
[07:34.540 --> 07:38.340]  I felt like a doctor as I asked that probably within two or three, two or three rips off
[07:38.340 --> 07:39.340]  the vape pen.
[07:39.340 --> 07:41.420]  Tell you the truth.
[07:41.420 --> 07:43.100]  I'd like the truth holding.
[07:43.100 --> 07:44.100]  You're not under oath or anything.
[07:44.100 --> 07:48.780]  Holding the damn thing in my hand and knowing that I'm about to take a hit off of it starts
[07:48.780 --> 07:57.180]  the process right there because I know relief is on its way and I think I've told you this
[07:57.180 --> 08:03.180]  before your definition of what a painkiller is.
[08:03.180 --> 08:12.460]  We know that CBDs help control pain, but marijuana in general changes your outlook on pain.
[08:12.460 --> 08:13.460]  Okay.
[08:13.460 --> 08:15.940]  So I think it's a little more tolerable.
[08:15.940 --> 08:19.780]  I think it's, and what is pain relief?
[08:19.780 --> 08:26.300]  I mean, that's what painkillers do is they, well, we know that there's chemicals that
[08:26.300 --> 08:30.820]  go in and shut down certain receptors.
[08:30.820 --> 08:34.380]  Maybe the THC part is making you forget that you hurt and helping your mind go to a better
[08:34.380 --> 08:39.540]  place instead of being focused on that hip and that lower back going out on you and hurting.
[08:39.540 --> 08:40.540]  Okay.
[08:40.540 --> 08:41.540]  Right.
[08:41.540 --> 08:42.540]  Okay.
[08:42.540 --> 08:44.420]  So two or three rips and you start feeling that forgetting about the pain and a little
[08:44.420 --> 08:45.700]  bit of pain going away.
[08:46.460 --> 08:50.220]  How long does that take?
[08:50.220 --> 08:52.780]  You can try it if you want to take two or three rips.
[08:52.780 --> 08:53.780]  It's in my mouth.
[08:53.780 --> 08:54.780]  Once it gets into the hand.
[08:54.780 --> 08:55.780]  Yeah.
[08:55.780 --> 08:56.780]  Once it's in the hand.
[08:56.780 --> 08:57.780]  Okay.
[08:57.780 --> 08:58.780]  So it starts right then immediately.
[08:58.780 --> 09:03.780]  And within about two or three rips, which only takes you, you know, 30 seconds.
[09:03.780 --> 09:04.780]  Yeah.
[09:04.780 --> 09:05.780]  Okay.
[09:05.780 --> 09:08.980]  So, but so within a minute, you're able to go back to doing whatever you needed to do.
[09:08.980 --> 09:11.820]  Take care of the kid, water the dog, walk the dog.
[09:11.820 --> 09:14.100]  Like I see you walk, he's got a dog that needs a lot of walking.
[09:14.100 --> 09:16.060]  So I see you walking with buddy quite frequently.
[09:16.060 --> 09:18.060]  Shout out to buddy, the dog.
[09:18.060 --> 09:19.060]  Yeah, buddy.
[09:19.060 --> 09:20.060]  Good boy.
[09:20.060 --> 09:21.060]  That's a good dog.
[09:21.060 --> 09:22.060]  Yeah.
[09:22.060 --> 09:25.380]  So within 30 seconds, if you were to take, and I won't even ask any about, about any
[09:25.380 --> 09:28.980]  pharmaceuticals that I know you take, but if you were to take a pharmaceutical to treat
[09:28.980 --> 09:29.980]  that pain, Oh no.
[09:29.980 --> 09:31.540]  20 minutes, 20 minutes.
[09:31.540 --> 09:34.380]  You know, if you're lucky and then what are the shitty side effects?
[09:34.380 --> 09:39.500]  Oh, well, he just leaned back into his chair like, well, you got all day and we do.
[09:39.500 --> 09:42.740]  So if you don't take your time, you talk opioids, right?
[09:42.740 --> 09:45.180]  Which is the major ones.
[09:45.180 --> 09:46.500]  Okay.
[09:46.500 --> 09:52.540]  Anywhere from the dry mouth to a listless feeling to constipation.
[09:52.540 --> 09:53.540]  Okay.
[09:53.540 --> 09:56.180]  And then they have to give you another medicine for that, don't they?
[09:56.180 --> 09:57.180]  Exactly.
[09:57.180 --> 10:00.340]  Well, that's their, that's the way they do medicine anymore at all.
[10:00.340 --> 10:01.340]  Absolutely.
[10:01.340 --> 10:02.340]  Okay.
[10:02.340 --> 10:03.340]  You know, they barely want to touch you anymore.
[10:03.340 --> 10:07.060]  It's just prescribe another medication and see how that works.
[10:07.060 --> 10:10.500]  Visit you on Skype and then prescribe you some more shit.
[10:10.500 --> 10:11.500]  No, I'm serious.
[10:11.500 --> 10:12.500]  No, I know that.
[10:13.260 --> 10:14.260]  I've said this before.
[10:14.260 --> 10:15.260]  I will never do that again.
[10:15.260 --> 10:17.860]  Uh, Skyping with your doctor is not a good thing.
[10:17.860 --> 10:19.340]  I want my doctor to touch me.
[10:19.340 --> 10:20.340]  Yeah.
[10:20.340 --> 10:22.940]  Well, you, you know, you'd like to be able to look around the room and see the diplomas.
[10:22.940 --> 10:28.060]  I could be sitting there with just a shirt on because that's, you know, that's all you
[10:28.060 --> 10:29.060]  see.
[10:29.060 --> 10:32.340]  It's not like you can look around and you like, you know, there's interaction between
[10:32.340 --> 10:34.780]  humans that doesn't happen on Skype.
[10:34.780 --> 10:35.780]  Absolutely.
[10:35.780 --> 10:36.780]  Right.
[10:36.780 --> 10:37.780]  Especially someone from your generation.
[10:37.780 --> 10:41.580]  Your Skype is probably fucking fangled technology for you.
[10:41.660 --> 10:42.660]  Yeah.
[10:42.660 --> 10:43.660]  Yeah.
[10:43.660 --> 10:46.900]  I try to keep current, but we don't expect you to be that current.
[10:46.900 --> 10:48.340]  I was periscoping earlier.
[10:48.340 --> 10:51.740]  You guys and Doug had no idea what was happening for the first 30 seconds of that periscope
[10:51.740 --> 10:52.740]  video.
[10:52.740 --> 10:53.740]  No, no.
[10:53.740 --> 10:54.740]  Looking around the room like, what's he talking to?
[10:54.740 --> 10:58.220]  I actually said, I'm going to periscope for a minute.
[10:58.220 --> 10:59.220]  Yeah.
[10:59.220 --> 11:00.220]  All right.
[11:00.220 --> 11:01.220]  So we'll get back on topic here.
[11:01.220 --> 11:05.020]  So within 30 seconds to a minute, you're feeling relief from the CBD, your pain and your hip
[11:05.020 --> 11:08.340]  isn't hurting, but 20 minutes if you take some medicine and dude also, thanks a lot
[11:08.340 --> 11:09.340]  for getting, let me get so personal.
[11:09.500 --> 11:12.100]  I'll ask about your medicine and tell me about your side effects and shit.
[11:12.100 --> 11:15.180]  That's kind of deep compared to taking pills.
[11:15.180 --> 11:18.100]  And I don't see why we can't grow our own.
[11:18.100 --> 11:21.700]  Why they don't want us to grow our own medicine when this dude can feel better in 20 minutes
[11:21.700 --> 11:23.220]  from taking a rip off of a vape pen.
[11:23.220 --> 11:25.500]  Well, it's money, but it works so well.
[11:25.500 --> 11:26.500]  Like I like what you say.
[11:26.500 --> 11:27.500]  It is money.
[11:27.500 --> 11:30.820]  If cannabis didn't do half of what it does, like it would be legal.
[11:30.820 --> 11:34.500]  Like if we discovered it right now, it would be celebrated everywhere.
[11:34.500 --> 11:35.660]  Someone should print that on a shirt.
[11:35.660 --> 11:39.780]  If cannabis didn't do half of what it does, it wouldn't, it would be illegal.
[11:39.780 --> 11:40.780]  Yeah.
[11:40.780 --> 11:41.780]  Yeah.
[11:41.780 --> 11:42.780]  It's true.
[11:42.780 --> 11:46.380]  If it, if it just worked as medicine, if we could just replace, you know, cotton with
[11:46.380 --> 11:49.900]  it, like all the pharmaceuticals, we could just do one replaced by it.
[11:49.900 --> 11:50.900]  Yep.
[11:50.900 --> 11:54.740]  I don't know about all, like there's still use for plenty of what pharma has to offer.
[11:54.740 --> 11:58.980]  It's just cannabis replaces a lot of what we're using it at a pharma inappropriately
[11:58.980 --> 11:59.980]  for now.
[11:59.980 --> 12:00.980]  You bet.
[12:00.980 --> 12:08.140]  I think anyone that's taking Vicodin realizes that we Colorado just upped the update from
[12:08.140 --> 12:13.860]  I think a grade two or grade three to a grade two narcotic.
[12:13.860 --> 12:15.220]  So there's no refills.
[12:15.220 --> 12:19.420]  You have to go to your doctor, you have to get a hard script from them and walk it to
[12:19.420 --> 12:21.180]  your pharmacy.
[12:21.180 --> 12:24.740]  It has to be filled out on a certain day.
[12:24.740 --> 12:27.100]  It's it's incredible.
[12:27.100 --> 12:32.780]  And the reason is because of the incredible losses that we've had of life due to overdosing.
[12:32.780 --> 12:33.780]  Right.
[12:33.780 --> 12:34.780]  And it's on the streets everywhere.
[12:34.780 --> 12:38.460]  It's easier sometimes to find stupid drugs and pills than it is to find weed.
[12:38.460 --> 12:43.340]  Before we had dispensaries, we could find the weed, but back in the day it, you'd run
[12:43.340 --> 12:45.860]  into other drugs and can't find the weed.
[12:45.860 --> 12:46.860]  Right.
[12:46.860 --> 12:47.860]  Yeah.
[12:47.860 --> 12:48.860]  And it's not that hard.
[12:48.860 --> 12:52.460]  It's actually would be easier for me to get some of this medication on the street than
[12:52.460 --> 12:54.300]  it is from the doctor anymore.
[12:54.300 --> 12:58.000]  And then that's what unfortunately results in heroin use when you can't get those pills
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.860]  anymore from your insurance company, your doctor being unavailable, then you're going
[13:01.860 --> 13:03.380]  to have to go and not, I know you wouldn't do it.
[13:03.380 --> 13:04.380]  You're an older dude.
[13:04.380 --> 13:06.600]  You got a strong mind and we'll keep you medicated with good weed.
[13:06.600 --> 13:09.700]  But other folks that don't have good weed and a good caregiver and a good family like
[13:09.700 --> 13:12.980]  yourself, they would have to go to the street and get something because their body hurts.
[13:12.980 --> 13:14.380]  They're sick from not having their pills.
[13:14.380 --> 13:15.380]  That's how it happens.
[13:15.380 --> 13:18.820]  All 50 states are facing an increase in heroin use right now.
[13:18.820 --> 13:23.220]  And that's exactly why is regular folk get hurt.
[13:23.220 --> 13:26.260]  They go to the doctor, the doctor throws opiates at them.
[13:26.260 --> 13:28.660]  They take the pill until their bones not broken anymore.
[13:28.660 --> 13:33.020]  And by the time they're healed, they're now addicted to whatever painkiller they were
[13:33.020 --> 13:34.020]  on.
[13:34.020 --> 13:35.020]  Right.
[13:35.020 --> 13:36.020]  So now they got to go find it.
[13:36.020 --> 13:39.860]  Eventually they get cut off or it becomes too expensive and they turn to heroin.
[13:39.860 --> 13:42.220]  Get some help if you need help, you guys.
[13:42.220 --> 13:43.220]  That's what I'm saying.
[13:43.220 --> 13:46.660]  So please feel free to tell the doctor, no, you don't need pain pills.
[13:46.660 --> 13:47.900]  Like sometimes you need pain pills.
[13:47.900 --> 13:51.180]  I'm not saying people don't because I've used them many, many times.
[13:51.180 --> 13:55.300]  I mean, like when I broke my finger, I had to refuse pain meds six different times.
[13:55.300 --> 13:59.260]  I kept asking if the pain was going to get any worse and they kept looking at me like
[13:59.260 --> 14:00.260]  I was insane.
[14:00.260 --> 14:01.260]  What the hell is that noise?
[14:01.260 --> 14:02.260]  Oh, it's a phone on the table.
[14:02.260 --> 14:03.260]  That was so weird.
[14:03.260 --> 14:04.260]  It's Doug's phone.
[14:04.260 --> 14:05.260]  Oh, it's all right.
[14:05.260 --> 14:06.260]  It vibrates stupid loud.
[14:06.260 --> 14:07.260]  Serious vibrate function.
[14:07.260 --> 14:08.260]  I thought it was the music in the show.
[14:08.260 --> 14:09.260]  I was like, what is happening?
[14:09.260 --> 14:10.260]  I just couldn't figure it out.
[14:10.260 --> 14:11.260]  No problem.
[14:11.260 --> 14:12.260]  No worries at all.
[14:12.260 --> 14:13.260]  All right.
[14:13.260 --> 14:14.260]  So Mike, I would ask you the same question kind of that I was asking Doug since we got
[14:14.260 --> 14:15.260]  off track here and I need to find a good place to go.
[14:15.260 --> 14:16.260]  I'm going to go to the grocery store.
[14:16.260 --> 14:17.260]  I'm going to go to the grocery store.
[14:21.300 --> 14:22.300]  a good launching spot.
[14:22.300 --> 14:25.660]  Can I ask what your medical condition is that you smoke for?
[14:25.660 --> 14:27.820]  And you don't have to go too into detail if you don't feel like it?
[14:27.820 --> 14:34.800]  The short version is I damaged my neck and never had cartilage in my knees and so I need
[14:34.800 --> 14:40.940]  something that helps with inflammation and nerve generated pain and cannabis works wonderfully
[14:40.940 --> 14:46.140]  where most of the drugs available on the pharmaceutical market don't do anything for nerve generated
[14:46.140 --> 14:47.140]  pain.
[14:47.140 --> 14:48.140]  No.
[14:48.140 --> 14:49.140]  So how long...
[14:49.140 --> 14:51.140]  What's your preferred method of smoking?
[14:51.140 --> 14:54.140]  Right now, dabbing.
[14:54.140 --> 15:00.140]  Yeah, we've currently upgraded smoking status until about a month or two ago.
[15:00.140 --> 15:01.140]  It was flowers.
[15:01.140 --> 15:03.140]  He was a heavy flower smoker in a pipe, right?
[15:03.140 --> 15:12.140]  Yep. Pipe and flowers or bong and flowers if I had a bong handy, but I broke my beautiful bong a while ago.
[15:12.140 --> 15:13.140]  Rest in peace, bong.
[15:13.140 --> 15:16.140]  Yep, and have just been piping it for a long time.
[15:16.140 --> 15:20.140]  And then recently upgraded to an oil rig and a nice nail and a torch.
[15:20.140 --> 15:25.140]  And I've been doing a lot of dabs lately, but flowers are still sort of my first love.
[15:25.140 --> 15:27.140]  Mike showed up with some delicious jelly bean hash today.
[15:27.140 --> 15:30.140]  A big shout out for that right on. Thank you. That's delicious.
[15:30.140 --> 15:31.140]  Yum.
[15:31.140 --> 15:32.140]  Yeah.
[15:32.140 --> 15:35.140]  That tastes fucking hella good and I'm high as fuck from it.
[15:35.140 --> 15:40.140]  But honestly, the most common way I consume these days is with tincture.
[15:40.140 --> 15:41.140]  Really? Okay.
[15:41.140 --> 15:53.140]  I do three milliliters of Synergy, which is a half THC, half CBD tincture compound that's really, really low dose.
[15:53.140 --> 16:00.140]  And I take it sort of as a preventative morning and evening to help keep the inflammation down before it gets bad.
[16:00.140 --> 16:05.140]  And that seems to work wonders for my knees and for my back.
[16:05.140 --> 16:07.140]  What do those cost for a customer?
[16:08.140 --> 16:14.140]  40 bucks before tax for 100 milligrams total.
[16:14.140 --> 16:17.140]  So for me, that's a week's worth of meds.
[16:17.140 --> 16:20.140]  Okay. Wow. Okay. 40 bucks for a week worth of meds.
[16:20.140 --> 16:23.140]  Yep. You get 30 doses per bottle and I'm taking six a day.
[16:23.140 --> 16:27.140]  So it's not even a seven day week for me. It's a five day week for me.
[16:27.140 --> 16:30.140]  All right. Dang. Okay. So it's worth it for 40 bucks?
[16:30.140 --> 16:34.140]  I was paying more when I was just taking pills.
[16:34.140 --> 16:36.140]  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Pills are expensive.
[16:36.140 --> 16:37.140]  Yep.
[16:37.140 --> 16:39.140]  Even if you've just got a copay or something.
[16:39.140 --> 16:42.140]  Yeah. I was just doing a copay and it was still 90 bucks a week.
[16:42.140 --> 16:47.140]  I got some Vicodins when I got some wisdom teeth pulled and going to get those was like 14 bucks for like seven pills.
[16:47.140 --> 16:50.140]  And that was the generic shit. And I was like, well, I don't even really need them.
[16:50.140 --> 16:52.140]  Why do I want to throw down a bunch of money for pills I don't need?
[16:52.140 --> 16:57.140]  When I stopped taking pills, I was on two different pain medications.
[16:57.140 --> 17:02.140]  Neither of them were opiates, but neither of them worked for shit either.
[17:02.140 --> 17:06.140]  And then I was on a third med to help cope with some of the side effects from the first two.
[17:06.140 --> 17:07.140]  Of course.
[17:07.140 --> 17:12.140]  And when I started smoking regularly and first got access to CBD flower,
[17:12.140 --> 17:16.140]  I didn't have a need for the pills at all the next day.
[17:16.140 --> 17:19.140]  So I just didn't take them one day and then I didn't take them the next day either.
[17:19.140 --> 17:21.140]  Nice. So now you're drug free.
[17:21.140 --> 17:23.140]  Well, except for cannabis.
[17:23.140 --> 17:27.140]  You're drug free, bro. I don't think cannabis is like a drug. That's a plant, man.
[17:27.140 --> 17:28.140]  It's a plant, man.
[17:28.140 --> 17:29.140]  It's still totally a drug.
[17:29.140 --> 17:30.140]  I don't do drugs, man.
[17:31.140 --> 17:33.140]  It's just a very good one.
[17:33.140 --> 17:35.140]  You don't do any hard drugs.
[17:35.140 --> 17:36.140]  No.
[17:36.140 --> 17:39.140]  So how long does those go ahead again?
[17:39.140 --> 17:40.140]  Something to say.
[17:40.140 --> 17:44.140]  Well, no, I was just interested in what he was saying, but I was thinking while he was saying that,
[17:44.140 --> 17:49.140]  that since I'm primarily using concentrates now,
[17:49.140 --> 17:58.970]  gotten completely off of two narcotic medications that I was getting through my doctor.
[17:58.970 --> 17:59.970]  Wow.
[17:59.970 --> 18:02.970]  From smoking concentrates on a daily basis.
[18:02.970 --> 18:04.970]  How long, how often do you smoke?
[18:04.970 --> 18:13.860]  Probably starting within an hour after I wake.
[18:13.860 --> 18:14.860]  Okay.
[18:14.860 --> 18:16.860]  Yeah, because you got to keep the pain away before it sets in.
[18:16.860 --> 18:17.860]  Right.
[18:17.860 --> 18:18.860]  Yeah. So you get a head start on the pain.
[18:18.860 --> 18:25.860]  And then throughout the day, it's not like a sit down smoke fest for me.
[18:25.860 --> 18:26.860]  It's just.
[18:26.860 --> 18:28.860]  You've got the pacifier hanging on your neck.
[18:28.860 --> 18:29.860]  I've got it right around my neck.
[18:29.860 --> 18:31.860]  You can just grab it and take a couple of rips.
[18:31.860 --> 18:33.860]  And go along my merry way.
[18:34.860 --> 18:35.860]  Okay.
[18:35.860 --> 18:36.860]  That happens to be.
[18:36.860 --> 18:38.860]  That's one of the things I really like about my pen.
[18:38.860 --> 18:46.860]  I find myself using it when I get home between like walking in the door from work and then like getting the dogs taken care of,
[18:46.860 --> 18:49.860]  getting the kid taken care of, getting dinner around, getting, you know,
[18:49.860 --> 18:52.860]  checking in with the other family members and seeing how their day went.
[18:52.860 --> 18:53.860]  Like I've got shit to do.
[18:53.860 --> 18:56.860]  I don't have time to sit down and take a dab and put my feet up or sit down.
[18:56.860 --> 18:58.860]  The single life is pretty great, isn't it?
[18:58.860 --> 18:59.860]  Yeah.
[18:59.860 --> 19:00.860]  The single life is fucking beautiful.
[19:01.860 --> 19:03.860]  I've got the email on and shit.
[19:03.860 --> 19:04.860]  It's ready to go.
[19:04.860 --> 19:06.860]  There's like four rigs on the table to hit.
[19:06.860 --> 19:07.860]  I can't have this kitchen set up.
[19:07.860 --> 19:13.860]  I had four 14 year olds walk into my house at 330 today, like looking for a place to spend an hour and a half.
[19:13.860 --> 19:15.860]  I know that feeling.
[19:15.860 --> 19:17.860]  Right.
[19:17.860 --> 19:21.860]  And then if you let them, you know, it becomes a permanent roosting place.
[19:21.860 --> 19:22.860]  Oh, yeah.
[19:22.860 --> 19:23.860]  For an hour every day.
[19:23.860 --> 19:24.860]  All right.
[19:24.860 --> 19:27.860]  So how much, how much hash?
[19:28.860 --> 19:30.860]  How long does a gram of hash last you?
[19:30.860 --> 19:31.860]  That's what I think I want to ask.
[19:31.860 --> 19:32.860]  Okay.
[19:32.860 --> 19:41.860]  Gram of hash last me, three, maybe four days tops.
[19:41.860 --> 19:42.860]  Okay.
[19:42.860 --> 19:44.860]  So you're getting down on about a quarter gram of good quality.
[19:44.860 --> 19:46.860]  You guys, this is the same hash that I smoke.
[19:46.860 --> 19:48.860]  Doug gets the hash that I smoke.
[19:48.860 --> 19:51.860]  When I get a slab, I break some off and it goes to Doug's direction every time.
[19:51.860 --> 19:53.860]  I know when Doug needs hash.
[19:53.860 --> 19:54.860]  I've got him kind of on a good schedule.
[19:54.860 --> 19:55.860]  Yes, he does.
[19:55.860 --> 19:56.860]  Yeah.
[19:56.860 --> 19:58.860]  So I tried to get mine around the same time and we all, I get,
[19:58.860 --> 20:00.860]  he gets the same shit that I get.
[20:00.860 --> 20:01.860]  He smokes what I smoke, you guys.
[20:01.860 --> 20:03.860]  So he's smoking top quality shatter.
[20:03.860 --> 20:06.860]  Sometimes it's wax if there's good wax around,
[20:06.860 --> 20:08.860]  but it's usually top quality snap and kill type shatter.
[20:08.860 --> 20:09.860]  You betcha.
[20:09.860 --> 20:10.860]  Yeah.
[20:10.860 --> 20:12.860]  Garden of Weedon shatter 90% of the time.
[20:12.860 --> 20:13.860]  Or the Turpex boys.
[20:13.860 --> 20:15.860]  Or the Turpex boys, which is also very good.
[20:15.860 --> 20:16.860]  There we go.
[20:16.860 --> 20:17.860]  So he's smoking the same stuff as me,
[20:17.860 --> 20:21.860]  about a quarter gram a day through a vape pen to keep himself medicated.
[20:21.860 --> 20:24.860]  And you guys, you can get that at a medical dispensary.
[20:24.860 --> 20:27.860]  It's going to be 30, 35 bucks at a rec shop.
[20:27.860 --> 20:29.860]  Mike, how much is a gram of Turpex hash going to cost us?
[20:29.860 --> 20:32.860]  50 plus tax goes to 58 and change out the door.
[20:32.860 --> 20:33.860]  Yeah.
[20:33.860 --> 20:34.860]  Like about, yeah.
[20:34.860 --> 20:36.860]  55, 58 bucks.
[20:36.860 --> 20:37.860]  I think 58 bucks.
[20:37.860 --> 20:41.860]  If you don't think that scares all of us that are on medical marijuana,
[20:41.860 --> 20:46.860]  that see dispensaries changing from just medical to medical and recreational,
[20:46.860 --> 20:51.860]  and then possibly to just recreational, uh, you're wrong.
[20:51.860 --> 20:52.860]  It does.
[20:52.860 --> 20:53.860]  Oh, I see it.
[20:53.860 --> 20:55.860]  I'm going to do my best to keep taking care of you, bro.
[20:55.860 --> 20:56.860]  That's why you guys are here.
[20:56.860 --> 20:57.860]  That's why you guys are here.
[20:57.860 --> 21:00.860]  I'm actually going to take Doug to renew his medical marijuana card on
[21:00.860 --> 21:01.860]  Wednesday.
[21:01.860 --> 21:02.860]  We keep up on that kind of shit.
[21:02.860 --> 21:08.860]  You can find rec hash in a range of prices between like 25 and 30 gram up
[21:08.860 --> 21:11.860]  to 90 a gram here locally.
[21:11.860 --> 21:14.860]  Um, but it's not always quality.
[21:14.860 --> 21:19.860]  There's still a lot of real mediocre amateur product on the market right
[21:20.860 --> 21:21.860]  now.
[21:21.860 --> 21:24.860]  Cause we're even our legal market doesn't have all of the things in place
[21:24.860 --> 21:25.860]  that it should.
[21:25.860 --> 21:27.860]  Quality standards are still a little lax.
[21:27.860 --> 21:31.860]  We're a little off topic, but did you buy any of the live wax from the spot?
[21:31.860 --> 21:33.860]  The TR concentrates?
[21:33.860 --> 21:35.860]  I have not purchased any, but I have consumed some.
[21:35.860 --> 21:37.860]  I would like a review of that.
[21:37.860 --> 21:38.860]  Stupendous.
[21:38.860 --> 21:39.860]  Stupendous.
[21:39.860 --> 21:40.860]  That's all I needed.
[21:40.860 --> 21:41.860]  Stupendous.
[21:41.860 --> 21:42.860]  One word that works for one word.
[21:42.860 --> 21:44.860]  Um, just the word.
[21:44.860 --> 21:47.860]  We've got half a dozen flavors on the shelf now,
[21:47.860 --> 21:49.860]  but I got some of the star dog and it was incredible guys.
[21:49.860 --> 21:51.860]  I may be investigating, investing in some of this shit.
[21:51.860 --> 21:55.860]  I just, the night I dropped my rig, um, I got to try it.
[21:55.860 --> 21:58.860]  And so that was the consolation 10 minutes later while I was mourning the
[21:58.860 --> 21:59.860]  loss of my original rig.
[21:59.860 --> 22:02.860]  Um, I got to hit some,
[22:02.860 --> 22:05.860]  what was 98 gram is now 75 a gram hash.
[22:05.860 --> 22:07.860]  Ah, very cool.
[22:07.860 --> 22:08.860]  Yep.
[22:08.860 --> 22:09.860]  Very cool.
[22:09.860 --> 22:10.860]  I mean,
[22:10.860 --> 22:11.860]  step in there after,
[22:11.860 --> 22:13.860]  after I work tomorrow and grab some of that and then a couple other things.
[22:13.860 --> 22:14.860]  All right.
[22:14.860 --> 22:15.860]  Call me if you do.
[22:15.860 --> 22:16.860]  Hell yeah.
[22:16.860 --> 22:17.860]  Um, all right.
[22:17.860 --> 22:19.860]  So I asked Doug how quickly it works,
[22:19.860 --> 22:21.860]  how he consumes it and how much of it he uses.
[22:21.860 --> 22:22.860]  Now I want to jump to Mike.
[22:22.860 --> 22:24.860]  We've talked about how he's using tinctures.
[22:24.860 --> 22:26.860]  I want to ask about when you've been dabbing lately,
[22:26.860 --> 22:28.860]  how many dabs does it take for you to feel relief?
[22:30.860 --> 22:34.860]  One to feel relief to,
[22:35.860 --> 22:39.860]  to kind of push the pain down to where it's sort of like your toe itches.
[22:39.860 --> 22:42.860]  It's no longer something of, um, it's something you're aware of,
[22:42.860 --> 22:44.860]  but it's not something of importance.
[22:44.860 --> 22:45.860]  Right.
[22:45.860 --> 22:46.860]  And that's how I feel after work is right there.
[22:46.860 --> 22:48.860]  That feeling is where I started out with pain.
[22:48.860 --> 22:52.860]  Usually about three of what I think of as Mike size dabs,
[22:52.860 --> 22:53.860]  which are fairly small dabs.
[22:53.860 --> 22:54.860]  Okay.
[22:54.860 --> 22:55.860]  Um,
[22:55.860 --> 22:56.860]  it does about a,
[22:56.860 --> 22:57.860]  after a third day,
[22:57.860 --> 22:59.860]  I was going to say maybe 0.1,
[22:59.860 --> 23:00.860]  a dab,
[23:00.860 --> 23:03.860]  maybe even a little less than that sometimes.
[23:03.860 --> 23:04.860]  Uh,
[23:04.860 --> 23:05.860]  but after about three,
[23:05.860 --> 23:10.860]  like there's some intoxication and like a lot more fun going on then,
[23:10.860 --> 23:12.860]  then just medical effect.
[23:12.860 --> 23:17.860]  But that first dabs all just turning the pain down from a five down into the
[23:17.860 --> 23:18.860]  one or two range.
[23:18.860 --> 23:19.860]  All right.
[23:19.860 --> 23:21.860]  So two and a half dabs would be cool,
[23:21.860 --> 23:22.860]  but you take that number three,
[23:22.860 --> 23:23.860]  cause you can't take a half dab.
[23:23.860 --> 23:24.860]  Right.
[23:24.860 --> 23:25.860]  And then,
[23:25.860 --> 23:26.860]  then there's some,
[23:26.860 --> 23:27.860]  then there's some intoxication going on.
[23:27.860 --> 23:28.860]  All right.
[23:28.860 --> 23:29.860]  Um,
[23:29.860 --> 23:30.860]  but,
[23:30.860 --> 23:31.860]  but you can handle six or eight dabs.
[23:31.860 --> 23:32.860]  Yeah.
[23:32.860 --> 23:35.860]  I can sit here and take eight or 10 and still be coherent.
[23:35.860 --> 23:37.860]  I'll just be stone.
[23:37.860 --> 23:38.860]  Yeah.
[23:38.860 --> 23:39.860]  Just stone and a little giddy.
[23:39.860 --> 23:40.860]  All right.
[23:40.860 --> 23:41.860]  So let's get to the,
[23:41.860 --> 23:42.860]  uh,
[23:42.860 --> 23:43.860]  the synergy drops that you've been taken.
[23:43.860 --> 23:44.860]  Um,
[23:44.860 --> 23:46.860]  you said you take three milliliters.
[23:46.860 --> 23:47.860]  How often?
[23:47.860 --> 23:48.860]  Uh,
[23:48.860 --> 23:50.860]  three milliliters in the morning and the three at night.
[23:50.860 --> 23:57.860]  And the dosing is 1.7 milligrams of THC and CBD per milliliter.
[23:57.860 --> 23:59.860]  So if I remember this,
[23:59.860 --> 24:03.860]  I'm taking about 5.8 milligrams of each in the morning.
[24:03.860 --> 24:04.860]  And then in the evening,
[24:04.860 --> 24:07.860]  now I could drink the whole a hundred milligram bottle.
[24:07.860 --> 24:09.860]  So 50 milligrams of both.
[24:09.860 --> 24:11.860]  It just drink it down like a shot or a chunk,
[24:11.860 --> 24:15.860]  like a beer and not get much intoxication from it.
[24:15.860 --> 24:18.860]  But if I take it in small doses in the morning and the evening,
[24:18.860 --> 24:22.860]  it feels like my knees never get to the point where they're really swollen and
[24:22.860 --> 24:23.860]  stiff and achy.
[24:23.860 --> 24:24.860]  Okay.
[24:24.860 --> 24:27.860]  And my neck never gets to the point where it's just a solid bar of muscle
[24:27.860 --> 24:28.860]  cramped up,
[24:28.860 --> 24:32.860]  trying to protect those vertebrae that are squeezing nervous nerve stems
[24:32.860 --> 24:33.860]  going down that arm.
[24:33.860 --> 24:34.860]  All right.
[24:34.860 --> 24:35.860]  And you guys,
[24:35.860 --> 24:36.860]  I feel like my mic is really hot.
[24:36.860 --> 24:37.860]  I'm sorry.
[24:37.860 --> 24:38.860]  Um,
[24:38.860 --> 24:39.860]  part of what,
[24:39.860 --> 24:43.860]  why they're doing the THC CBD combo is I believe that you need both
[24:43.860 --> 24:46.860]  cannabinoids to get into your bloodstream to work together,
[24:46.860 --> 24:48.860]  to hit the mind a little bit,
[24:48.860 --> 24:49.860]  to take your mind off of things,
[24:49.860 --> 24:51.860]  to work on the THC hits the nerve pain.
[24:51.860 --> 24:53.860]  I think the CBD goes for the,
[24:53.860 --> 24:55.860]  like the swollen stuff.
[24:55.860 --> 24:59.860]  I think together you don't get super high from it.
[24:59.860 --> 25:01.860]  You don't feel much high from the CBD,
[25:01.860 --> 25:06.860]  THC 50 50 combo because the CBD really feels like it calms down the high.
[25:07.860 --> 25:08.860]  It does.
[25:08.860 --> 25:09.860]  It's a,
[25:09.860 --> 25:13.860]  there's research into that CBD keeps the THC high from being quite a
[25:13.860 --> 25:14.860]  psychoactive.
[25:14.860 --> 25:17.860]  So the CBD helps kind of tone it down.
[25:17.860 --> 25:21.860]  There's I've heard people carry CBD pills from time to time when there's
[25:21.860 --> 25:23.860]  going to be extreme consumption going on,
[25:23.860 --> 25:25.860]  just in case anybody goes a little overboard,
[25:25.860 --> 25:28.860]  they've got sort of a comedown lever that they can pull.
[25:28.860 --> 25:31.860]  So if your girlfriend takes a big dab and can't handle her shit,
[25:31.860 --> 25:34.860]  you just give her a CBD dab and she'll relax a little in theory.
[25:34.860 --> 25:35.860]  In theory.
[25:35.860 --> 25:36.860]  I hope so.
[25:36.860 --> 25:37.860]  Let's try.
[25:37.860 --> 25:40.860]  Or somebody doesn't read the label and eats the whole candy bar.
[25:40.860 --> 25:41.860]  Oh man.
[25:41.860 --> 25:42.860]  Before man.
[25:42.860 --> 25:43.860]  No,
[25:43.860 --> 25:45.860]  then you just want to leave them alone and not give them any more.
[25:45.860 --> 25:49.860]  Just give them some cartoons and some good food.
[25:49.860 --> 25:50.860]  Make them a sandwich.
[25:50.860 --> 25:51.860]  A sandwich.
[25:51.860 --> 25:52.860]  Yeah.
[25:52.860 --> 25:53.860]  All right.
[25:53.860 --> 25:57.860]  So how much does the synergy cost?
[25:57.860 --> 25:58.860]  40 a bottle.
[25:58.860 --> 25:59.860]  40.
[25:59.860 --> 26:00.860]  That's right.
[26:00.860 --> 26:01.860]  Yeah.
[26:01.860 --> 26:02.860]  Okay.
[26:02.860 --> 26:03.860]  And it lasts you a week,
[26:03.860 --> 26:04.860]  five days,
[26:04.860 --> 26:05.860]  and Doug's plant pan.
[26:05.860 --> 26:06.860]  If you go to a dispensary,
[26:06.860 --> 26:07.860]  it's going to be 40,
[26:07.860 --> 26:08.860]  45,
[26:08.860 --> 26:09.860]  30,
[26:09.860 --> 26:10.860]  maybe 25.
[26:10.860 --> 26:11.860]  If you can.
[26:11.860 --> 26:15.860]  And find like member pricing and you get that first time shopper.
[26:15.860 --> 26:20.860]  There's a couple that I I've seen advertised it on certain days at certain
[26:20.860 --> 26:21.860]  times.
[26:21.860 --> 26:22.860]  Right.
[26:22.860 --> 26:23.860]  I'll have a special or something.
[26:23.860 --> 26:24.860]  Yeah.
[26:24.860 --> 26:25.860]  Wednesday or some shit,
[26:25.860 --> 26:26.860]  something like that.
[26:26.860 --> 26:32.860]  But I've never been able to find a constant quality like you deliver.
[26:32.860 --> 26:33.860]  Right.
[26:33.860 --> 26:34.860]  Well,
[26:34.860 --> 26:35.860]  that's the garden of Weeden.
[26:35.860 --> 26:36.860]  So I.
[26:36.860 --> 26:37.860]  The difference.
[26:37.860 --> 26:38.860]  Yeah.
[26:38.860 --> 26:41.860]  Between a good caregiver and a bad caregiver is being sort of hammered out
[26:41.860 --> 26:42.860]  on this show.
[26:42.860 --> 26:46.860]  I wish that I did not have to charge Doug anything for the,
[26:46.860 --> 26:48.860]  the hash that he consumes,
[26:48.860 --> 26:49.860]  but it doesn't always come from me.
[26:49.860 --> 26:51.860]  So I have to go get it.
[26:51.860 --> 26:52.860]  So I have to just relay it.
[26:52.860 --> 26:53.860]  And I don't make a penny off of my,
[26:53.860 --> 26:56.860]  my caregiver NIS for people like people that I am their caregiver.
[26:56.860 --> 26:57.860]  I don't,
[26:57.860 --> 26:58.860]  I don't know.
[26:58.860 --> 26:59.860]  I don't make any money off of those people.
[26:59.860 --> 27:00.860]  I do not do that.
[27:00.860 --> 27:01.860]  Doug stays pretty well medicated.
[27:01.860 --> 27:02.860]  Yes,
[27:02.860 --> 27:03.860]  I do.
[27:03.860 --> 27:04.860]  Yes,
[27:04.860 --> 27:05.860]  he does.
[27:05.860 --> 27:06.860]  He's got some flow right now.
[27:06.860 --> 27:07.860]  Yes,
[27:07.860 --> 27:08.860]  I do.
[27:08.860 --> 27:09.860]  Got some nice flow.
[27:09.860 --> 27:10.860]  I have some white widow in a couple of few days.
[27:10.860 --> 27:11.860]  So will Mike,
[27:11.860 --> 27:12.860]  Mike just looked at me like,
[27:12.860 --> 27:17.860]  I have that ever so often craving for the flower.
[27:17.860 --> 27:18.860]  Just,
[27:18.860 --> 27:19.860]  you know,
[27:19.860 --> 27:20.860]  I I'm a dad.
[27:20.860 --> 27:21.860]  Okay.
[27:21.860 --> 27:22.860]  Let's,
[27:22.860 --> 27:23.860]  I fucking going to jump into this one.
[27:23.860 --> 27:24.860]  I take fat dabs.
[27:24.860 --> 27:25.860]  You guys,
[27:25.860 --> 27:26.860]  my knees hurt.
[27:26.860 --> 27:27.860]  My knees fucking hurt.
[27:27.860 --> 27:28.860]  If you guys were ever near me and hear me bend over or just crouch down,
[27:28.860 --> 27:29.860]  my knees sound like shotgun.
[27:29.860 --> 27:31.860]  You can't be as tall as we are and not have any issues.
[27:31.860 --> 27:32.860]  Yeah,
[27:32.860 --> 27:33.860]  I think so.
[27:33.860 --> 27:34.860]  I think that's true.
[27:34.860 --> 27:35.860]  Cause my knees get wobbly sometimes when I'm tired,
[27:35.860 --> 27:36.860]  like they just get like shaky and my hips hurt.
[27:36.860 --> 27:37.860]  And then,
[27:37.860 --> 27:38.860]  uh,
[27:38.860 --> 27:39.860]  I've got some stomach issues,
[27:39.860 --> 27:40.860]  you guys,
[27:40.860 --> 27:41.860]  and not a lot of,
[27:41.860 --> 27:42.860]  but my stomach sucks.
[27:42.860 --> 27:43.860]  I've got some stomach problems,
[27:43.860 --> 27:44.860]  but so I take fat,
[27:44.860 --> 27:45.860]  fat dabs.
[27:45.860 --> 27:46.860]  You guys,
[27:46.860 --> 27:47.860]  I take,
[27:47.860 --> 27:48.860]  um,
[27:48.860 --> 27:49.860]  some more between 0.3 and 0.5.
[27:49.860 --> 27:50.860]  I like to smoke about a gram and a half a hash a day.
[27:50.860 --> 27:51.860]  Um,
[27:51.860 --> 27:54.860]  I do that in about three sessions throughout the day.
[27:54.860 --> 27:56.860]  I'll take about one dab in the morning,
[27:56.860 --> 27:57.860]  right when like,
[27:57.860 --> 27:58.860]  not right when I get up and get myself,
[27:58.860 --> 27:59.860]  I like get up,
[27:59.860 --> 28:01.860]  get the morning shower and get dressed right before I leave.
[28:01.860 --> 28:04.860]  I'll take one dab just so that I'm kind of crispy when I'm getting where I'm
[28:04.860 --> 28:05.860]  going at lunchtime.
[28:05.860 --> 28:06.860]  Uh,
[28:06.860 --> 28:07.860]  I may get a little dab,
[28:07.860 --> 28:09.860]  like about a 0.3 and then do it,
[28:09.860 --> 28:10.860]  bro.
[28:10.860 --> 28:11.860]  Take some of that CBD oil.
[28:11.860 --> 28:12.860]  And then after work,
[28:12.860 --> 28:13.860]  I'll come home and take like a 0.5.
[28:13.860 --> 28:14.860]  And then,
[28:14.860 --> 28:15.860]  uh,
[28:15.860 --> 28:17.860]  before the show I did about a 0.5 and then later on in the evening before
[28:17.860 --> 28:18.860]  bed,
[28:18.860 --> 28:21.860]  I'll just drop like another 0.5 instead of taking 30 dabs throughout the
[28:21.860 --> 28:22.860]  day.
[28:22.860 --> 28:23.860]  I take like six or seven of them,
[28:23.860 --> 28:26.860]  I guess maybe three to six fat dabs throughout the day.
[28:26.860 --> 28:28.860]  And that keeps me well medicated.
[28:28.860 --> 28:29.860]  Uh,
[28:29.860 --> 28:30.860]  it's expensive,
[28:30.860 --> 28:31.860]  but since I'm the,
[28:31.860 --> 28:32.860]  I,
[28:32.860 --> 28:34.860]  I produce it myself mostly like that part,
[28:34.860 --> 28:36.860]  or I get it from Spence,
[28:36.860 --> 28:37.860]  garden of Weeden kind of guys.
[28:37.860 --> 28:39.860]  I don't know if I should be saying that much on the show,
[28:39.860 --> 28:41.860]  but since the garden of Weeden can supply us with quality hash and
[28:41.860 --> 28:42.860]  dispensaries,
[28:42.860 --> 28:44.860]  I work at a shop that can supply me with quality hash.
[28:44.860 --> 28:47.860]  Then I go to a medical shop and buy a bunch of shit all the time.
[28:47.860 --> 28:48.860]  But,
[28:48.860 --> 28:49.860]  uh,
[28:49.860 --> 28:50.860]  I smoke a lot and I stay well medicated.
[28:50.860 --> 28:51.860]  I like to eat edibles,
[28:51.860 --> 28:52.860]  but they hit me hard,
[28:52.860 --> 28:53.860]  hard.
[28:53.860 --> 28:54.860]  How do edibles hit you?
[28:54.860 --> 28:55.860]  Yeah,
[28:55.860 --> 28:56.860]  they hit me hard too,
[28:57.860 --> 29:01.860]  but it's because you're consuming a hundred percent of it is staying within
[29:01.860 --> 29:02.860]  your body.
[29:02.860 --> 29:05.860]  You're not blowing out 35% of what you just took in.
[29:05.860 --> 29:06.860]  Right.
[29:06.860 --> 29:07.860]  So it takes a little longer.
[29:07.860 --> 29:08.860]  Uh,
[29:08.860 --> 29:14.860]  the rush is a little different the way that it feels when it starts to get
[29:14.860 --> 29:15.860]  into your bloodstream.
[29:15.860 --> 29:17.860]  I feel like it comes on slower,
[29:17.860 --> 29:18.860]  but hits a lot harder.
[29:18.860 --> 29:19.860]  Yeah,
[29:19.860 --> 29:20.860]  I do too.
[29:20.860 --> 29:22.860]  I can more of a body feeling.
[29:22.860 --> 29:23.860]  How did you do that?
[29:23.860 --> 29:25.860]  Did you take some CBD oil and some of the jelly bean?
[29:25.860 --> 29:26.860]  Yeah,
[29:26.860 --> 29:30.860]  I use the CBD oil to keep the jelly bean wax stuck to the dabber.
[29:30.860 --> 29:31.860]  You're a fucking mad man.
[29:31.860 --> 29:33.860]  Prepare to hear me cough like a sissy girl.
[29:33.860 --> 29:34.860]  Yeah,
[29:34.860 --> 29:35.860]  that's going to work oddly,
[29:35.860 --> 29:36.860]  but I trust you with it.
[29:36.860 --> 29:39.860]  Please don't burn self or microphone.
[29:39.860 --> 29:44.860]  Mike's playing with the email cord and the dab rig and the microphone in his
[29:44.860 --> 29:45.860]  face.
[29:45.860 --> 29:46.860]  Uh,
[29:46.860 --> 29:47.860]  it looks like the pothead Olympics.
[29:47.860 --> 29:48.860]  Yeah.
[29:48.860 --> 29:51.860]  Some kind of stoner obstacle course management bitches.
[29:51.860 --> 29:52.860]  Cord management.
[29:52.860 --> 29:53.860]  Yeah.
[29:53.860 --> 29:57.860]  I'm going to ask him when he gets done coughing,
[29:57.860 --> 30:00.860]  I'm going to ask him about how he likes edibles and how they work for him.
[30:00.860 --> 30:01.860]  But,
[30:01.860 --> 30:02.860]  uh,
[30:02.860 --> 30:03.860]  Doug,
[30:03.860 --> 30:04.860]  you were talking earlier about how medicine just totally,
[30:04.860 --> 30:05.860]  uh,
[30:05.860 --> 30:07.860]  helps you like psychological whole thing.
[30:07.860 --> 30:12.860]  Do you need a sativa or does the CBD medicine get to your head a little bit
[30:12.860 --> 30:13.860]  as well?
[30:13.860 --> 30:14.860]  When you smoke the tour of Bora,
[30:14.860 --> 30:16.860]  the tour of Bora is really high in CBD,
[30:16.860 --> 30:18.860]  so we can use that as a specific plan.
[30:18.860 --> 30:19.860]  Okay.
[30:19.860 --> 30:20.860]  Yeah.
[30:20.860 --> 30:21.860]  Yeah.
[30:21.860 --> 30:22.860]  And I really liked the tour of Bora.
[30:22.860 --> 30:26.860]  Shout out to DNA genetics for breeding it and a shout out to the person.
[30:26.860 --> 30:27.860]  They got me a cut.
[30:27.860 --> 30:28.860]  There we go.
[30:28.860 --> 30:29.860]  Yeah.
[30:29.860 --> 30:30.860]  It,
[30:30.860 --> 30:31.860]  um,
[30:31.860 --> 30:34.860]  you can tell between different strains,
[30:34.860 --> 30:38.860]  even with some that say there are the same strain,
[30:38.860 --> 30:39.860]  uh,
[30:39.860 --> 30:41.860]  different ways that it affects you as you,
[30:41.860 --> 30:42.860]  as you're ingesting it,
[30:42.860 --> 30:43.860]  you know,
[30:43.860 --> 30:44.860]  uh,
[30:44.860 --> 30:47.860]  some more mentally than physically.
[30:47.860 --> 30:51.860]  So you kind of forget about the pain before the relief of the pain.
[30:51.860 --> 30:56.860]  And sometimes just the opposite tour bore is more of relief of the pain and
[30:56.860 --> 30:58.860]  then the metal aspect.
[30:58.860 --> 30:59.860]  So it comes in,
[30:59.860 --> 31:01.860]  knocks out the pain and then later on it gets you high.
[31:01.860 --> 31:02.860]  Yeah.
[31:02.860 --> 31:03.860]  All right.
[31:03.860 --> 31:04.860]  Okay.
[31:04.860 --> 31:05.860]  See,
[31:05.860 --> 31:06.860]  I don't smoke a lot of the CBD stuff.
[31:06.860 --> 31:07.860]  You guys,
[31:07.860 --> 31:08.860]  it doesn't do much for me.
[31:08.860 --> 31:09.860]  So these guys get all the CBD products that I get.
[31:09.860 --> 31:10.860]  I was gifted that hash.
[31:10.860 --> 31:11.860]  If Doug wants a dab of that one,
[31:11.860 --> 31:12.860]  give him a dab of that one too.
[31:12.860 --> 31:13.860]  Mike make sure Doug gets some CBD.
[31:13.860 --> 31:14.860]  I'll give a shot of that.
[31:14.860 --> 31:15.860]  Don't give it too big.
[31:15.860 --> 31:20.860]  It's hard to get big dabs of the CBD oil because it's super viscous.
[31:21.860 --> 31:22.860]  This,
[31:22.860 --> 31:23.860]  uh,
[31:23.860 --> 31:24.860]  this dabbers got a flat tip on it and it may work a little bit better.
[31:24.860 --> 31:25.860]  Yeah.
[31:25.860 --> 31:26.860]  It was so cold.
[31:26.860 --> 31:28.860]  It felt like it was burning for a second.
[31:28.860 --> 31:30.860]  Isn't that weird how your body can do that?
[31:30.860 --> 31:31.860]  You guys,
[31:31.860 --> 31:33.860]  winter is here in Colorado.
[31:33.860 --> 31:34.860]  I don't know about winter,
[31:34.860 --> 31:35.860]  but fall is certainly here in Colorado.
[31:35.860 --> 31:36.860]  Yep.
[31:36.860 --> 31:39.860]  You need a long sleeve shirt when you drive to work in the mornings and done
[31:39.860 --> 31:40.860]  changed.
[31:40.860 --> 31:41.860]  You know,
[31:41.860 --> 31:42.860]  and speaking medically,
[31:42.860 --> 31:43.860]  I know we're talking about pain.
[31:43.860 --> 31:44.860]  Yeah.
[31:44.860 --> 31:45.860]  I'd love to hear what you have to say,
[31:45.860 --> 31:46.860]  Doug,
[31:46.860 --> 31:47.860]  but,
[31:47.860 --> 31:48.860]  uh,
[31:48.860 --> 31:50.860]  I have post traumatic stress disorder.
[31:50.860 --> 31:51.860]  Okay.
[31:51.860 --> 31:52.860]  And,
[31:52.860 --> 31:53.860]  uh,
[31:53.860 --> 31:55.860]  I know there's been a lot of studies looked at.
[31:55.860 --> 31:58.860]  I think that it's probably the best medicine for it.
[31:58.860 --> 31:59.860]  Uh,
[31:59.860 --> 32:02.860]  tried and had been prescribed many other things,
[32:02.860 --> 32:06.860]  but I believe that cannabis is probably the best thing that I've ever had.
[32:06.860 --> 32:09.860]  That helps me control what goes on with that.
[32:09.860 --> 32:10.860]  You know,
[32:10.860 --> 32:11.860]  uh,
[32:11.860 --> 32:12.860]  I don't want to,
[32:12.860 --> 32:13.860]  yeah,
[32:13.860 --> 32:14.860]  I probably got a similar thing.
[32:14.860 --> 32:15.860]  I don't want to compare myself,
[32:15.860 --> 32:17.860]  but I probably got something and I'll agree with you.
[32:17.860 --> 32:19.860]  And if I start thinking about shit that I don't even want to think about,
[32:19.860 --> 32:21.860]  I can make those things not happen in my mind.
[32:21.860 --> 32:24.860]  It's just by coming and just taking a couple of dabs and it may be part of the
[32:24.860 --> 32:25.860]  ritual.
[32:25.860 --> 32:27.860]  Like you were saying earlier of just not grab a dab,
[32:27.860 --> 32:28.860]  get into the internet,
[32:28.860 --> 32:29.860]  play around for a minute.
[32:29.860 --> 32:30.860]  My brain will change.
[32:30.860 --> 32:31.860]  Yeah.
[32:31.860 --> 32:32.860]  Like,
[32:32.860 --> 32:33.860]  yeah.
[32:33.860 --> 32:34.860]  It's also,
[32:34.860 --> 32:35.860]  you know,
[32:35.860 --> 32:36.860]  for me,
[32:36.860 --> 32:37.860]  it's real hard for,
[32:37.860 --> 32:38.860]  uh,
[32:38.860 --> 32:39.860]  he used to love to go over anywhere.
[32:39.860 --> 32:40.860]  There was lots of people.
[32:40.860 --> 32:41.860]  It's not that way anymore.
[32:41.860 --> 32:43.860]  I really have to get prepared to go to the grocery store.
[32:43.860 --> 32:45.860]  Not because I don't know what I'm going to get.
[32:45.860 --> 32:47.860]  Cause I get the same thing every time,
[32:47.860 --> 32:49.860]  but just to deal with,
[32:49.860 --> 32:52.860]  with people in close quarters,
[32:52.860 --> 32:54.860]  it makes me uncomfortable.
[32:54.860 --> 32:56.860]  I would rather not deal with,
[32:56.860 --> 32:57.860]  if I come up in the parking lot,
[32:57.860 --> 33:01.860]  it's completely full or you look over in the baskets are almost all gone.
[33:01.860 --> 33:03.860]  I just go back home.
[33:03.860 --> 33:04.860]  Okay.
[33:04.860 --> 33:05.860]  You know,
[33:05.860 --> 33:08.860]  which even if I really need the food,
[33:08.860 --> 33:10.860]  I'll just go back home,
[33:10.860 --> 33:14.860]  chill for a little bit and wait for the crowds to die down.
[33:14.860 --> 33:15.860]  Bread and cheese.
[33:15.860 --> 33:16.860]  Ain't that bad?
[33:16.860 --> 33:17.860]  Yeah.
[33:17.860 --> 33:18.860]  Not that bad.
[33:18.860 --> 33:19.860]  But you know,
[33:19.860 --> 33:20.860]  sometimes you can't do that.
[33:20.860 --> 33:21.860]  I,
[33:21.860 --> 33:22.860]  you know,
[33:22.860 --> 33:23.860]  you got other people depending on you.
[33:23.860 --> 33:24.860]  Um,
[33:24.860 --> 33:26.860]  then you suck it up and you do it.
[33:26.860 --> 33:29.860]  And sometimes based with those types of situations,
[33:29.860 --> 33:31.860]  cannabis definitely helps me deal with them.
[33:31.860 --> 33:32.860]  Okay.
[33:32.860 --> 33:33.860]  It helps.
[33:33.860 --> 33:34.860]  It's a little bit of anxiety.
[33:34.860 --> 33:37.860]  A little bit of social anxiety.
[33:37.860 --> 33:38.860]  Okay.
[33:38.860 --> 33:39.860]  All right.
[33:39.860 --> 33:43.860]  So if anybody's listening that doesn't think that this shit is good for PTSD,
[33:43.860 --> 33:45.860]  because in Colorado we cannot get it validated as a,
[33:45.860 --> 33:49.860]  a qualifying condition for medical treatment or for medical use.
[33:49.860 --> 33:53.860]  If you guys think that that's not a reason to use it,
[33:53.860 --> 33:54.860]  listen to this dude.
[33:54.860 --> 33:55.860]  This is an honest guy.
[33:55.860 --> 33:56.860]  This dude has never lied to me.
[33:56.860 --> 33:58.860]  I believe every single word that Doug has ever said.
[33:58.860 --> 33:59.860]  Yeah.
[33:59.860 --> 34:00.860]  He's got no reason to lie to me.
[34:00.860 --> 34:01.860]  He's a 60 year old dude.
[34:01.860 --> 34:02.860]  He's done his thing.
[34:02.860 --> 34:03.860]  Yeah.
[34:03.860 --> 34:04.860]  Like those days.
[34:04.860 --> 34:05.860]  Yeah.
[34:05.860 --> 34:06.860]  You don't need to impress anybody.
[34:06.860 --> 34:08.860]  There's nobody to impress anymore.
[34:08.860 --> 34:09.860]  God damn it.
[34:09.860 --> 34:11.860]  I'm going to take some dabs with these kids and be on the podcast.
[34:12.860 --> 34:13.860]  And it works.
[34:13.860 --> 34:14.860]  Oh yeah, dude.
[34:14.860 --> 34:15.860]  I love having you around.
[34:15.860 --> 34:18.860]  Well, I enjoy being with you and I'm going to enjoy this.
[34:18.860 --> 34:19.860]  Yeah.
[34:19.860 --> 34:20.860]  Salute.
[34:20.860 --> 34:21.860]  There we go.
[34:21.860 --> 34:22.860]  All right.
[34:22.860 --> 34:24.860]  So my good friend Doug is taking a really quite wonderful.
[34:24.860 --> 34:26.860]  Well, a shout out to the person that gave it to me.
[34:26.860 --> 34:28.860]  I don't know if they want to be mentioned on the show or not.
[34:28.860 --> 34:29.860]  They do nice work.
[34:29.860 --> 34:31.860]  The pain is melting as we speak.
[34:31.860 --> 34:32.860]  Yes.
[34:32.860 --> 34:33.860]  Yeah.
[34:33.860 --> 34:34.860]  That cherry flavor.
[34:34.860 --> 34:35.860]  Yep.
[34:35.860 --> 34:36.860]  Yeah.
[34:36.860 --> 34:37.860]  I don't smoke a lot of the CBD.
[34:37.860 --> 34:38.860]  I saved all that for you guys.
[34:38.860 --> 34:39.860]  Kind of over here.
[34:39.860 --> 34:41.860]  Just kind of tucked away until you guys showed up.
[34:41.860 --> 34:42.860]  That's delicious.
[34:42.860 --> 34:43.860]  Cherries.
[34:43.860 --> 34:44.860]  It is.
[34:44.860 --> 34:46.860]  It's like a mouthful of cherries.
[34:46.860 --> 34:49.860]  Out of the hit man rig with the elevate dropdown on the email.
[34:49.860 --> 34:51.860]  Cause we're champs over here.
[34:51.860 --> 34:52.860]  Oh, that was marvelous.
[34:52.860 --> 34:53.860]  Right on for helping him out.
[34:53.860 --> 34:54.860]  Mike.
[34:54.860 --> 34:55.860]  Mike with the, uh,
[34:55.860 --> 34:58.860]  It looks like some climbed up there.
[34:58.860 --> 34:59.860]  Oh yeah.
[34:59.860 --> 35:00.860]  This carb cap needs to be cleaned a little bit.
[35:00.860 --> 35:01.860]  They get quite filthy around here.
[35:01.860 --> 35:02.860]  Dirty car.
[35:02.860 --> 35:04.860]  If anybody needs to add, there's a little wax in here,
[35:04.860 --> 35:06.860]  but I think you guys would be cool for a minute.
[35:06.860 --> 35:07.860]  All right.
[35:07.860 --> 35:08.860]  So Doug was talking about, uh,
[35:08.860 --> 35:10.860]  Oh, you were talking about how bad it helps with the PTSD.
[35:10.860 --> 35:11.860]  Yeah.
[35:11.860 --> 35:14.860]  You know, and we, you know, the military was looking into it.
[35:14.860 --> 35:15.860]  Um,
[35:15.860 --> 35:20.860]  They found out that they didn't want to do it right now,
[35:20.860 --> 35:21.860]  but I, uh,
[35:21.860 --> 35:25.860]  I think that if you were to talk some people that were suffering from it,
[35:25.860 --> 35:26.860]  um,
[35:26.860 --> 35:28.860]  I think we see a lot of them around town now.
[35:28.860 --> 35:30.860]  Yeah, absolutely.
[35:30.860 --> 35:31.860]  Because this is where the help is.
[35:31.860 --> 35:32.860]  Yeah.
[35:32.860 --> 35:33.860]  Yeah.
[35:33.860 --> 35:34.860]  Oh man.
[35:34.860 --> 35:35.860]  So many people are coming here and you guys,
[35:36.860 --> 35:38.860]  unfortunately what I've discovered through some conversations lately,
[35:38.860 --> 35:41.860]  there are a lot of children moving hair for CBD treatment.
[35:41.860 --> 35:45.860]  And those people are falling into traps with people that advertise that they
[35:45.860 --> 35:49.860]  can give them CBD medicine and they're not providing the CBD medicine.
[35:49.860 --> 35:50.860]  Unfortunately,
[35:50.860 --> 35:53.860]  if you're looking for qualified legitimate CBD medicine in Colorado,
[35:53.860 --> 35:56.860]  somebody that can take on a new person and provide that it's going to be a
[35:56.860 --> 35:59.860]  three month wait, maybe six months.
[35:59.860 --> 36:00.860]  Yeah.
[36:00.860 --> 36:03.860]  The caregivers are strapped and with the new,
[36:03.860 --> 36:07.860]  the new regulations taking effect in January, I doubt, um,
[36:07.860 --> 36:10.860]  many more people will be becoming caregivers.
[36:10.860 --> 36:14.860]  I expect a number of caregivers in business now to end up not being
[36:14.860 --> 36:18.860]  caregivers sometime by the middle of next year. Um,
[36:18.860 --> 36:22.860]  the state's really looking to clamp down and kind of stamp out that whole
[36:22.860 --> 36:24.860]  section of our industry, which sucks for people like me and Doug.
[36:24.860 --> 36:25.860]  Absolutely.
[36:25.860 --> 36:26.860]  That's that's depressing.
[36:26.860 --> 36:27.860]  And myself.
[36:27.860 --> 36:28.860]  Yep.
[36:28.860 --> 36:30.860]  There's a lot of new rules coming down the pipe that are going to make it
[36:30.860 --> 36:34.860]  incredibly difficult for people to produce the amount of meds they need for
[36:34.860 --> 36:35.860]  their patients.
[36:35.860 --> 36:36.860]  Yeah.
[36:36.860 --> 36:37.860]  And that's, and that's by design.
[36:37.860 --> 36:39.860]  They want everybody buying from the stores.
[36:39.860 --> 36:44.860]  And we're going to see Walmart type stores in the future.
[36:44.860 --> 36:45.860]  Right. Yep.
[36:45.860 --> 36:46.860]  Well, like we talked about earlier,
[36:46.860 --> 36:49.860]  I'm already having to source other shatter to get you guys supplied in your
[36:49.860 --> 36:51.860]  shatter because everybody stepped up.
[36:51.860 --> 36:53.860]  I don't know if it was a good idea for me to step everybody up to shatter,
[36:53.860 --> 36:56.860]  but I got you guys all smoking good hash now.
[36:56.860 --> 36:59.860]  So now I can't even supply enough of it because you guys smoke so much of it.
[36:59.860 --> 37:01.860]  I'm not complaining, but between the three of us,
[37:01.860 --> 37:02.860]  we clean out the garden that I grow.
[37:02.860 --> 37:03.860]  Yeah.
[37:03.860 --> 37:04.860]  Well,
[37:04.860 --> 37:08.860]  and other people that I know are everybody's looking towards concentrates.
[37:08.860 --> 37:09.860]  Right.
[37:09.860 --> 37:11.860]  Because it's so much more convenient and it works better.
[37:11.860 --> 37:13.860]  All the way around.
[37:13.860 --> 37:14.860]  It's just a better product.
[37:14.860 --> 37:15.860]  Right.
[37:15.860 --> 37:18.860]  For me, it's the time saver is what I've been enjoying lately.
[37:18.860 --> 37:19.860]  Yeah.
[37:19.860 --> 37:20.860]  Like my day is full.
[37:20.860 --> 37:22.860]  My hours are very, very well allocated.
[37:22.860 --> 37:28.860]  I don't have extra time to grind up some bud packables sit there and puff on it
[37:28.860 --> 37:29.860]  for a little while.
[37:29.860 --> 37:31.860]  I just don't have that kind of time anymore.
[37:31.860 --> 37:32.860]  Right.
[37:32.860 --> 37:33.860]  Yep.
[37:33.860 --> 37:36.860]  And a quick dab gets me where I need to be and I can get back to doing
[37:36.860 --> 37:37.860]  whatever I need to be doing.
[37:37.860 --> 37:39.860]  Take a fat dunk and keep on moving.
[37:39.860 --> 37:40.860]  Yeah.
[37:40.860 --> 37:41.860]  Take a dab cough for a minute,
[37:41.860 --> 37:44.860]  chug a soda and get back to whatever I was doing.
[37:44.860 --> 37:45.860]  Oh,
[37:45.860 --> 37:46.860]  the other half of the yard.
[37:46.860 --> 37:47.860]  I'm going to make fun of Mike for a minute,
[37:47.860 --> 37:50.860]  but this is all in good fun because he's one of my favorite people to hang
[37:50.860 --> 37:51.860]  out with Mike,
[37:51.860 --> 37:52.860]  my bro and he knows it.
[37:52.860 --> 37:54.860]  If you're ever with Mike and you are thirsty,
[37:54.860 --> 37:55.860]  just tap him on the shoulder and say,
[37:55.860 --> 37:56.860]  just because he,
[37:56.860 --> 37:58.860]  Mike has a Mountain Dew with him.
[37:58.860 --> 38:01.860]  Mike probably has six to 12 Mountain Dews.
[38:01.860 --> 38:04.860]  I got sick of having cotton mouth and not having anything to drink.
[38:04.860 --> 38:05.860]  So I did something about it.
[38:05.860 --> 38:06.860]  Yeah.
[38:06.860 --> 38:08.860]  Some people carry like their cigarettes and like a safe spot.
[38:08.860 --> 38:10.860]  Mike's got Mountain Dews up his sleeve.
[38:10.860 --> 38:11.860]  He can fling them out of his arm.
[38:11.860 --> 38:13.860]  Like he's Spiderman or some shit.
[38:13.860 --> 38:14.860]  Yep.
[38:14.860 --> 38:17.860]  I've always got at least one at reach.
[38:17.860 --> 38:18.860]  Yes,
[38:18.860 --> 38:19.860]  he does.
[38:19.860 --> 38:20.860]  All right.
[38:20.860 --> 38:22.860]  So I appreciate you guys kind of let me talk a little bit about your
[38:22.860 --> 38:23.860]  conditions and shit.
[38:23.860 --> 38:24.860]  Do you have any,
[38:24.860 --> 38:25.860]  I want to change the subject in just a second,
[38:25.860 --> 38:26.860]  but before I do,
[38:26.860 --> 38:27.860]  I want to give you guys the opportunity.
[38:27.860 --> 38:29.860]  Do you have anything to add to this part before I kind of move on to a
[38:29.860 --> 38:31.860]  totally random question that I want to ask you guys about,
[38:31.860 --> 38:32.860]  just because I'm curious.
[38:32.860 --> 38:35.860]  You guys both look to me in silence.
[38:35.860 --> 38:37.860]  I'm looking forward to more,
[38:37.860 --> 38:39.860]  a bigger selection of CBD edibles.
[38:39.860 --> 38:40.860]  That would be nice.
[38:40.860 --> 38:41.860]  That would be very nice.
[38:41.860 --> 38:45.860]  Wouldn't it be nice to just get up and eat like a muffin or a bagel or
[38:45.860 --> 38:46.860]  a cookie or whatever,
[38:46.860 --> 38:47.860]  just had your dose in it.
[38:47.860 --> 38:51.860]  The way that this industry is working,
[38:51.860 --> 38:53.860]  you guys aren't going to be able to eat muffins and cookies for much
[38:53.860 --> 38:54.860]  longer.
[38:54.860 --> 38:56.860]  You guys are going to regulate the shit out of it so much that a muffin
[38:56.860 --> 38:57.860]  will not be allowed.
[38:57.860 --> 39:00.860]  If they can airbrush that dumb ass yellow triangle on it,
[39:00.860 --> 39:01.860]  they're good.
[39:01.860 --> 39:03.860]  You can airbrush my poppy seed muffin.
[39:03.860 --> 39:04.860]  People get on it.
[39:04.860 --> 39:07.860]  The regulations on edibles are becoming ridiculous.
[39:07.860 --> 39:08.860]  Really ridiculous.
[39:08.860 --> 39:09.860]  And it sucks.
[39:09.860 --> 39:11.860]  Some of my favorite products are going to be leaving store shelves.
[39:11.860 --> 39:16.860]  And coming back in 10 milligram maximum containers,
[39:16.860 --> 39:17.860]  which sucks.
[39:17.860 --> 39:18.860]  I like the drinks.
[39:18.860 --> 39:20.860]  The kick in time is a lot quicker.
[39:20.860 --> 39:21.860]  Yeah.
[39:21.860 --> 39:22.860]  Oh yeah.
[39:22.860 --> 39:23.860]  You bet you do.
[39:23.860 --> 39:26.860]  I forget how spoiled I am being a medical patient,
[39:26.860 --> 39:29.860]  being able to walk into a shop and get a drink with a hundred milligrams
[39:29.860 --> 39:31.860]  of THC and that sucker.
[39:31.860 --> 39:32.860]  But on the rec side,
[39:32.860 --> 39:34.860]  you guys have to put 10 milligrams in them and drink 10 of them.
[39:34.860 --> 39:35.860]  That's the same effect.
[39:35.860 --> 39:36.860]  That's coming.
[39:36.860 --> 39:37.860]  You can get a hundred milligram drink right now,
[39:37.860 --> 39:39.860]  but they're taking that away.
[39:39.860 --> 39:40.860]  If you can't carry the stamp,
[39:40.860 --> 39:42.860]  it's got to be in a 10 milligram package period.
[39:42.860 --> 39:45.860]  So if you can't stamp your shit,
[39:45.860 --> 39:46.860]  no more,
[39:46.860 --> 39:47.860]  I mean,
[39:47.860 --> 39:48.860]  you can't stamp liquids periods,
[39:48.860 --> 39:49.860]  so liquids,
[39:49.860 --> 39:50.860]  popcorns,
[39:50.860 --> 39:52.860]  granola is that kind of thing's got to come in a 10 milligram.
[39:52.860 --> 39:55.860]  So they're actually going to put a stamp on everything.
[39:55.860 --> 39:56.860]  That's the plan.
[39:56.860 --> 39:57.860]  So like a cookie,
[39:57.860 --> 39:58.860]  a stamp,
[39:58.860 --> 39:59.860]  yellow triangle,
[39:59.860 --> 40:00.860]  yellow triangle.
[40:00.860 --> 40:03.860]  So that the teacher can see it from across the room.
[40:03.860 --> 40:04.860]  It's the theory.
[40:04.860 --> 40:05.860]  Well,
[40:05.860 --> 40:09.860]  but like I've got a triangle on my good.
[40:09.860 --> 40:11.860]  Why is it society?
[40:11.860 --> 40:12.860]  Everybody?
[40:12.860 --> 40:13.860]  Why shouldn't it be parenting?
[40:13.860 --> 40:15.860]  Shouldn't we focus on parenting instead of labeling?
[40:15.860 --> 40:19.860]  Fucked up analogy that I came up with is we,
[40:19.860 --> 40:20.860]  we,
[40:20.860 --> 40:22.860]  we put a special symbol on the fake guns,
[40:22.860 --> 40:24.860]  not the real ones,
[40:24.860 --> 40:25.860]  but we got,
[40:25.860 --> 40:28.860]  we got to put a special symbol on it.
[40:28.860 --> 40:29.860]  Right now.
[40:29.860 --> 40:32.860]  All your toy guns got to come with a little orange nub on the
[40:32.860 --> 40:33.860]  fucking front of it.
[40:33.860 --> 40:34.860]  Right?
[40:34.860 --> 40:36.860]  But no real gun doesn't need nothing on it.
[40:36.860 --> 40:37.860]  Just like,
[40:37.860 --> 40:38.860]  just so you know,
[40:38.860 --> 40:41.860]  this is a gun gun and not like a lookalike gun or a squirt gun.
[40:41.860 --> 40:44.860]  I wish somebody could have seen me pressing my forehead against this
[40:44.860 --> 40:46.860]  microphone in retardation,
[40:47.860 --> 40:51.860]  but now all the pot cookies have to carry a special fucking warning symbol
[40:51.860 --> 40:56.860]  because people that have never been in a marijuana shop are convinced
[40:56.860 --> 41:00.860]  that they look just like chips away and that they're going to be at a
[41:00.860 --> 41:01.860]  party one day.
[41:01.860 --> 41:04.860]  And one of us is going to change out the real chips away for the
[41:04.860 --> 41:06.860]  medicated chips away.
[41:06.860 --> 41:07.860]  No way.
[41:07.860 --> 41:09.860]  And then they're going to kill everybody at their church because it's
[41:09.860 --> 41:10.860]  just nuts.
[41:10.860 --> 41:12.860]  I'm going to share the cookies with you guys,
[41:12.860 --> 41:13.860]  my friends,
[41:13.860 --> 41:14.860]  and I'm going to tell you about it.
[41:14.860 --> 41:15.860]  Hey,
[41:15.860 --> 41:16.860]  there's weed in these eat them with me.
[41:16.860 --> 41:20.860]  They've ginned up so much fear last Halloween that we're definitely going
[41:20.860 --> 41:21.860]  to pass.
[41:21.860 --> 41:22.860]  I was going to head that way.
[41:22.860 --> 41:23.860]  That was part of what I was going to ask here.
[41:23.860 --> 41:24.860]  And then a minute,
[41:24.860 --> 41:25.860]  I had two questions for you.
[41:25.860 --> 41:27.860]  And the Halloween was one of them.
[41:27.860 --> 41:29.860]  Cause we were putting up Halloween decorations at the spot.
[41:29.860 --> 41:30.860]  And I was like,
[41:30.860 --> 41:32.860]  do you guys really think that somebody is going to give out some weed
[41:32.860 --> 41:33.860]  candy this year?
[41:33.860 --> 41:34.860]  And Mike kind of beat me to it.
[41:34.860 --> 41:36.860]  So last year,
[41:36.860 --> 41:38.860]  the eat it themselves.
[41:38.860 --> 41:39.860]  Yeah.
[41:39.860 --> 41:41.860]  The two big anti-pot groups in the state,
[41:41.860 --> 41:46.860]  like took out billboards with edibles out of their packaging next to candy
[41:46.860 --> 41:49.860]  or edible treats that they look similar to.
[41:49.860 --> 41:50.860]  It was like,
[41:50.860 --> 41:51.860]  if you can't tell the difference,
[41:51.860 --> 41:52.860]  how were your kids?
[41:52.860 --> 41:56.860]  And not a whole bunch of people in the state were convinced that the day
[41:56.860 --> 41:57.860]  after Halloween,
[41:57.860 --> 42:00.860]  like the ERs would just be full of kids that were just high as shit.
[42:00.860 --> 42:02.860]  It didn't happen.
[42:02.860 --> 42:04.860]  And it didn't happen for a lot of reasons,
[42:04.860 --> 42:06.860]  mostly because it's the dumbest crime ever.
[42:06.860 --> 42:07.860]  Right?
[42:07.860 --> 42:09.860]  Like there are so many better ways to get a felony.
[42:09.860 --> 42:13.860]  You can't hand out dirty candy on Halloween and have like,
[42:13.860 --> 42:15.860]  that leads right back to you.
[42:15.860 --> 42:17.860]  And there's no payoff for the criminal.
[42:17.860 --> 42:18.860]  Right.
[42:18.860 --> 42:21.860]  You got about three hours worth of he's the sick fuck that likes to hurt
[42:21.860 --> 42:22.860]  kids.
[42:22.860 --> 42:24.860]  Like doesn't like to hurt kids in theory.
[42:24.860 --> 42:25.860]  And it was expensive.
[42:25.860 --> 42:26.860]  Right?
[42:26.860 --> 42:28.860]  Like 25 bucks a fucking piece.
[42:28.860 --> 42:31.860]  Like who's got that kind of money to get local kids known.
[42:31.860 --> 42:32.860]  Right.
[42:32.860 --> 42:33.860]  I'm going to eat them all.
[42:33.860 --> 42:34.860]  Right.
[42:34.860 --> 42:37.860]  If you guys think that you have candy that your kids got on Halloween and
[42:38.860 --> 42:40.860]  you suspect that it is medicated with cannabis,
[42:40.860 --> 42:42.860]  you can send that shit to the show.
[42:42.860 --> 42:43.860]  You can send it right to me.
[42:43.860 --> 42:44.860]  My name is Rasta Jeff.
[42:44.860 --> 42:45.860]  I've got a PO box.
[42:45.860 --> 42:46.860]  You can send it.
[42:46.860 --> 42:47.860]  No, I shouldn't do that.
[42:47.860 --> 42:48.860]  We'll pick it up in person.
[42:48.860 --> 42:49.860]  We'll come pick it up in person.
[42:49.860 --> 42:50.860]  Let's fuck all this mail.
[42:50.860 --> 42:51.860]  I don't want to get myself in trouble.
[42:51.860 --> 42:52.860]  We'll come pick it up.
[42:52.860 --> 42:53.860]  Call me.
[42:53.860 --> 42:55.860]  I will eat all of it or half of it,
[42:55.860 --> 42:56.860]  whatever you choose.
[42:56.860 --> 42:57.860]  And in a little bit,
[42:57.860 --> 42:59.860]  I'll tell you if that shit has medicated cannabis in it.
[42:59.860 --> 43:00.860]  We'll see.
[43:00.860 --> 43:01.860]  We'll see if that's,
[43:01.860 --> 43:02.860]  if it's medicated with,
[43:02.860 --> 43:03.860]  with THC.
[43:03.860 --> 43:04.860]  It's always,
[43:04.860 --> 43:05.860]  it's always the scare tactics.
[43:05.860 --> 43:06.860]  You know,
[43:06.860 --> 43:08.860]  when I was a child and went trick or treating,
[43:08.860 --> 43:10.860]  people gave out popcorn balls and fruit.
[43:10.860 --> 43:13.860]  And then one year there was a massive scare that someone was putting razor
[43:13.860 --> 43:15.860]  blades in those fruits and other things in your cookies.
[43:15.860 --> 43:17.860]  And all of a sudden you couldn't take grandma's treats anymore.
[43:17.860 --> 43:19.860]  They had to go buy them from the store and they had to be packaged.
[43:19.860 --> 43:20.860]  And Mars company loved it.
[43:20.860 --> 43:21.860]  Oh yeah.
[43:21.860 --> 43:22.860]  Who do you think did it?
[43:22.860 --> 43:23.860]  Yeah.
[43:23.860 --> 43:24.860]  I think it's,
[43:24.860 --> 43:25.860]  it's a,
[43:25.860 --> 43:26.860]  it's a,
[43:26.860 --> 43:27.860]  it's a,
[43:27.860 --> 43:28.860]  it's a,
[43:28.860 --> 43:29.860]  it's a,
[43:29.860 --> 43:30.860]  it's a,
[43:30.860 --> 43:31.860]  it's a,
[43:31.860 --> 43:32.860]  it's a,
[43:32.860 --> 43:33.860]  it's a,
[43:33.860 --> 43:34.860]  it's a,
[43:34.860 --> 43:35.860]  it's that thing that killed the pan.
[43:35.860 --> 43:36.860]  Does that make sense?
[43:36.860 --> 43:37.860]  That is a terrible joke.
[43:37.860 --> 43:38.860]  Well,
[43:38.860 --> 43:39.860]  he didn't and then that thing was like,
[43:39.860 --> 43:40.860]  what do you think?
[43:40.860 --> 43:41.860]  Did it?
[43:41.860 --> 43:42.860]  Yeah.
[43:42.860 --> 43:43.860]  Exactly.
[43:43.860 --> 43:45.860]  The best marketing campaign Mars have ever come up with.
[43:45.860 --> 43:48.860]  That's almost too smart to spur a corporation pay one of their kids,
[43:48.860 --> 43:49.860]  let me feed you this sneaker.
[43:49.860 --> 43:50.860]  Oh,
[43:50.860 --> 43:51.860]  no,
[43:51.860 --> 43:53.860]  let me feed you this random ex brand candy.
[43:53.860 --> 43:54.860]  It'll put you on the news.
[43:54.860 --> 43:56.860]  And we'll make it rich on the type of asshole who spent four hours on the
[43:56.860 --> 44:02.860]  internet looking for cases of it's happened like three times.
[44:02.860 --> 44:06.220]  family members that were like, fuck my dumb ass nephew.
[44:06.220 --> 44:10.180]  And I mean, it's not funny, but it's really funny
[44:10.180 --> 44:12.860]  because when you think that the lengths we've gone to
[44:12.860 --> 44:15.480]  as a nation to like every nice old lady
[44:15.480 --> 44:17.340]  that's ever tried to make sugar cookies
[44:17.340 --> 44:19.100]  for all the kids that come by.
[44:19.100 --> 44:21.300]  And then like three hours into Halloween,
[44:21.300 --> 44:23.060]  they realize that they're fucking sidewalks
[44:23.060 --> 44:24.340]  covered with sugar cookies
[44:24.340 --> 44:27.020]  and all the parents think they're insane
[44:27.020 --> 44:29.300]  because they just happen to miss that part
[44:29.300 --> 44:32.820]  of our mass education against taking delicious treats
[44:32.860 --> 44:33.940]  from people on Halloween.
[44:33.940 --> 44:35.620]  I need a cookie from an old lady.
[44:35.620 --> 44:36.980]  She ain't got no reason to hate me.
[44:36.980 --> 44:38.420]  Right?
[44:38.420 --> 44:40.620]  I'm pretty scared of who I take candy from.
[44:41.780 --> 44:43.820]  As an adult, I've been to Grateful Dead shows, man.
[44:43.820 --> 44:45.140]  You don't take candy from strangers.
[44:45.140 --> 44:46.660]  They can fuck up your whole weekend.
[44:46.660 --> 44:48.460]  Hey, and as a responsible parent,
[44:48.460 --> 44:51.220]  you look through that candy before you give your child
[44:51.220 --> 44:52.820]  just to make sure they're not getting it.
[44:52.820 --> 44:53.660]  Just to get all the ones you like.
[44:53.660 --> 44:54.500]  You gotta take out all the Reese's peanut butter cups.
[44:54.500 --> 44:56.220]  And then you get the ones you want the most.
[44:56.220 --> 44:57.060]  Exactly.
[44:57.060 --> 44:58.660]  Yeah, my parents love that rule.
[44:58.660 --> 45:00.460]  I never got back the number of Snickers
[45:00.460 --> 45:01.780]  I know I fucking collected.
[45:01.780 --> 45:02.620]  That's the truth.
[45:02.620 --> 45:03.460]  For Halloween night.
[45:03.460 --> 45:05.220]  Butterscotch are no good for you, son.
[45:05.220 --> 45:08.540]  We'll put those in a special pile over here.
[45:08.540 --> 45:10.420]  These might've been opened or something wrong
[45:10.420 --> 45:11.300]  with them maybe.
[45:11.300 --> 45:12.860]  Yeah, these are mine.
[45:12.860 --> 45:14.260]  We used to go to the fancy neighborhoods
[45:14.260 --> 45:16.700]  and find out where they were giving out the best candy.
[45:16.700 --> 45:18.780]  I would take two or three masks in my car.
[45:18.780 --> 45:19.860]  Cause we, yeah, yeah.
[45:19.860 --> 45:20.700]  I still trick or treat in my car.
[45:20.700 --> 45:21.540]  In my car?
[45:21.540 --> 45:22.380]  Yeah.
[45:22.380 --> 45:23.220]  Yeah.
[45:23.220 --> 45:24.060]  Yeah.
[45:24.060 --> 45:27.500]  We'd cruise up to El Camino and University Park.
[45:28.660 --> 45:31.260]  Hey, at least I wasn't stealing the bags.
[45:31.300 --> 45:33.460]  Some of my friends were out just taking bags of candy
[45:33.460 --> 45:34.300]  from other kids.
[45:34.300 --> 45:35.260]  I was actually trick or treating.
[45:35.260 --> 45:36.140]  Go Pueblo.
[45:36.140 --> 45:37.700]  I pled my case to some lady.
[45:37.700 --> 45:38.540]  She's like, you're too old.
[45:38.540 --> 45:39.940]  And I go, I could have just been out stealing candy
[45:39.940 --> 45:40.780]  from kids.
[45:40.780 --> 45:41.620]  And she's like, here, take two.
[45:41.620 --> 45:43.300]  I was like, all right, thank you.
[45:43.300 --> 45:44.500]  That's what I get.
[45:46.060 --> 45:48.060]  So let's shift gears.
[45:48.060 --> 45:49.100]  Happy Halloween, all you guys.
[45:49.100 --> 45:50.940]  This will be coming out a little bit before Halloween.
[45:50.940 --> 45:52.060]  Is this the Halloween show?
[45:52.060 --> 45:53.020]  No, it's Hallowellas.
[45:53.020 --> 45:54.980]  Since number 100 is going to be celebration.
[45:54.980 --> 45:57.340]  The one after 101 will probably be the Halloween show,
[45:57.340 --> 45:58.180]  but whatever.
[45:58.180 --> 45:59.020]  It's October.
[45:59.020 --> 46:00.300]  This is the fall celebration show.
[46:00.300 --> 46:01.140]  Cool.
[46:01.980 --> 46:02.820]  The boo preview.
[46:02.820 --> 46:03.700]  Harvest party.
[46:03.700 --> 46:04.540]  I like that.
[46:04.540 --> 46:05.380]  It's almost harvest time.
[46:05.380 --> 46:06.860]  We should get Jesse on here to talk about harvest.
[46:06.860 --> 46:07.940]  A lot of people harvesting.
[46:07.940 --> 46:08.780]  Chop, chop, chop.
[46:08.780 --> 46:11.220]  Or if they got to keep it, it was their time also.
[46:11.220 --> 46:12.060]  Right?
[46:12.060 --> 46:12.900]  And it hasn't disappeared.
[46:12.900 --> 46:13.740]  If you got to keep it.
[46:13.740 --> 46:15.260]  All right, dude, number 100 is next.
[46:15.260 --> 46:16.100]  Holy shit.
[46:16.100 --> 46:16.940]  That's so awesome.
[46:16.940 --> 46:17.780]  That's crazy.
[46:17.780 --> 46:18.620]  That is great.
[46:18.620 --> 46:19.460]  You figured out what you're doing yet?
[46:19.460 --> 46:20.740]  Yeah, we're going to have a bunch of people on the podcast
[46:20.740 --> 46:22.180]  and we're going to talk about stuff.
[46:22.180 --> 46:23.020]  Cool.
[46:23.020 --> 46:25.900]  You know those shows when I set up like six microphones
[46:25.900 --> 46:26.740]  and it gets chaotic?
[46:26.740 --> 46:27.580]  Yep.
[46:27.580 --> 46:28.420]  That's what we're going to do.
[46:28.420 --> 46:29.260]  Those are fun.
[46:29.460 --> 46:30.300]  It's going to be loud.
[46:30.300 --> 46:31.460]  And Spence will hit Maddie in the face
[46:31.460 --> 46:32.300]  with the microphone a lot.
[46:32.300 --> 46:33.980]  And we'll laugh a bunch of times.
[46:33.980 --> 46:34.820]  It'll be funny.
[46:34.820 --> 46:35.900]  Hopefully I can get Maddie and Spence over.
[46:35.900 --> 46:37.300]  Another episode 50, dude.
[46:37.300 --> 46:38.140]  I fucking love it.
[46:38.140 --> 46:38.980]  Yeah.
[46:38.980 --> 46:39.820]  50 times too.
[46:39.820 --> 46:40.660]  It'll be twice as great.
[46:40.660 --> 46:41.500]  50 dose.
[46:41.500 --> 46:42.340]  Yeah.
[46:42.340 --> 46:43.160]  If you guys want to,
[46:43.160 --> 46:44.500]  if you're listening to the podcast this far,
[46:44.500 --> 46:46.540]  I'd love you for listening to our random banter.
[46:46.540 --> 46:47.380]  Yeah, well done everybody.
[46:47.380 --> 46:48.220]  We're just buddies hanging out at this point.
[46:48.220 --> 46:49.460]  Way to be dedicated.
[46:49.460 --> 46:50.940]  But if there's something you remember
[46:50.940 --> 46:52.260]  from the first hundred episodes
[46:52.260 --> 46:54.900]  that you'd like me to reminisce about,
[46:54.900 --> 46:56.460]  send me your favorite moments of the show.
[46:56.460 --> 46:57.580]  Let me know what you're thinking about.
[46:57.580 --> 46:58.540]  What makes you laugh?
[46:58.580 --> 46:59.420]  Your favorite memories?
[46:59.420 --> 47:00.780]  Something that sticks out to you on the show.
[47:00.780 --> 47:02.220]  Let me know what you think of.
[47:02.220 --> 47:04.500]  Like, remember that one time you said this?
[47:04.500 --> 47:05.540]  You can send a couple of them.
[47:05.540 --> 47:06.980]  You're not limited to just one,
[47:06.980 --> 47:08.220]  but tweet it to me.
[47:08.220 --> 47:09.860]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[47:09.860 --> 47:10.700]  Email it to me.
[47:10.700 --> 47:12.020]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[47:12.020 --> 47:13.700]  or find it on Facebook.
[47:13.700 --> 47:15.960]  It's the Grow From Your Heart podcast on Facebook.
[47:15.960 --> 47:17.300]  Message me, let me know.
[47:17.300 --> 47:18.620]  And we'll kind of reminisce about it
[47:18.620 --> 47:20.140]  and go talk back about it on the show.
[47:20.140 --> 47:21.540]  If you let me know what episode,
[47:21.540 --> 47:22.380]  be like, on episode this,
[47:22.380 --> 47:23.720]  you said this or just whatever, you know,
[47:23.720 --> 47:24.860]  let me know what you remember.
[47:24.860 --> 47:25.940]  And we'll laugh about it again.
[47:25.940 --> 47:26.980]  And be like, I did say that.
[47:27.140 --> 47:28.460]  Sometimes I say some goofy shit.
[47:28.460 --> 47:30.040]  Sometimes I say some great shit.
[47:30.040 --> 47:31.260]  Remind me what stood out to you.
[47:31.260 --> 47:32.520]  I'd like to hear it.
[47:32.520 --> 47:33.540]  Yeah, same goes for me.
[47:33.540 --> 47:35.000]  If you like something I said on the show,
[47:35.000 --> 47:36.500]  you guys have been getting a lot of me lately.
[47:36.500 --> 47:38.300]  If you like it, tweet me.
[47:38.300 --> 47:39.740]  You guys, follow Mike on Twitter.
[47:39.740 --> 47:40.900]  What's your Twitter handle?
[47:40.900 --> 47:44.380]  Nemopunk15, yeah, at Twitter.
[47:44.380 --> 47:46.220]  A little higher, because-
[47:46.220 --> 47:47.420]  That's at Nemopunk15.
[47:47.420 --> 47:48.860]  Yeah, at Nemopunk15.

[47:50.660 --> 47:51.500]  And when you follow him,

[47:54.620 --> 47:56.620]  or you're following me from the podcast.
[47:57.260 --> 47:58.660]  Hashtag Grow From Your Heart.
[47:58.660 --> 48:00.740]  Hashtag GFYH podcast, something like that.
[48:00.740 --> 48:02.540]  That or you saw me fucking with prohibitionists
[48:02.540 --> 48:04.180]  and thought it was funny and wanted more of it.
[48:04.180 --> 48:05.020]  Yeah.
[48:05.020 --> 48:08.100]  And if you find me, you're too stoned, I'm not there.
[48:08.100 --> 48:09.060]  Yeah, right.
[48:09.060 --> 48:11.060]  Doug doesn't really do much social media.
[48:11.060 --> 48:12.820]  We'll keep him on the down low.
[48:12.820 --> 48:15.740]  So lately, you guys, the hot topic has been,
[48:15.740 --> 48:16.660]  and we're just gonna go on this one
[48:16.660 --> 48:17.500]  for a couple of seconds,
[48:17.500 --> 48:18.320]  because I wrote it down
[48:18.320 --> 48:19.700]  and I just wanna be able to cross it off,
[48:19.700 --> 48:21.240]  because I'm a completionist.
[48:21.240 --> 48:23.860]  How do you guys feel about professional athletes
[48:23.900 --> 48:27.340]  being able to use marijuana first in their on season
[48:27.340 --> 48:28.580]  and also in their off season?
[48:28.580 --> 48:29.700]  That's two different subjects.
[48:29.700 --> 48:31.180]  You're on the clock and not off the clock.
[48:31.180 --> 48:32.820]  I think when you're with a team, they kind of own you.
[48:32.820 --> 48:35.080]  So we have to make two separate subjects.
[48:35.080 --> 48:35.920]  Did I say that wrong?
[48:35.920 --> 48:36.740]  Is that not good to say?
[48:36.740 --> 48:37.580]  You don't look like,
[48:37.580 --> 48:38.660]  no, I don't mean it like that, bro.
[48:38.660 --> 48:39.500]  I do kind of, maybe I do.
[48:39.500 --> 48:43.100]  You do, it really depends on your take on it.
[48:43.100 --> 48:46.300]  Just you always be careful with that particular verbiage.
[48:46.300 --> 48:47.580]  Yeah, I think everybody understands.
[48:47.580 --> 48:52.140]  But in this case, you're not totally in the wrong,
[48:52.140 --> 48:52.980]  I suppose.
[48:53.900 --> 48:56.540]  They live under some pretty insane fucking regiment.
[48:56.540 --> 48:59.700]  Yeah, you're on their clock all the time during the season.
[48:59.700 --> 49:00.940]  Well, it doesn't,
[49:00.940 --> 49:02.940]  they're worth millions and millions of dollars.
[49:02.940 --> 49:04.260]  Yeah.
[49:04.260 --> 49:05.100]  Their health and their performance.
[49:05.100 --> 49:06.740]  This just keeps getting worse.
[49:06.740 --> 49:07.900]  Yeah.
[49:07.900 --> 49:08.720]  So, all right.
[49:08.720 --> 49:11.100]  So you're on the clock basically during the on season,
[49:11.100 --> 49:12.900]  the whole season, from the time season starts,
[49:12.900 --> 49:14.660]  from whatever preseason, training time,
[49:14.660 --> 49:15.900]  spring, whatever spring training,
[49:15.900 --> 49:18.420]  when it starts, you're on the clock until that Super Bowl
[49:18.420 --> 49:20.620]  or whenever your team is fucking finished.
[49:20.620 --> 49:23.300]  Whatever you fail or win, you're on the clock.
[49:24.020 --> 49:25.620]  So, should you be able to use cannabis
[49:25.620 --> 49:29.700]  to alleviate your pains or for whatever reason,
[49:29.700 --> 49:31.780]  fuck it, it's a recreational state.
[49:31.780 --> 49:34.820]  The neuroprotectant research coming out,
[49:34.820 --> 49:37.260]  that's really promising.
[49:37.260 --> 49:40.620]  Like it might really help deal with concussions,
[49:40.620 --> 49:43.020]  brain injuries, that kind of thing.
[49:43.020 --> 49:44.700]  So it might be really, yeah,
[49:44.700 --> 49:46.740]  it might be insanely fucking helpful
[49:46.740 --> 49:48.900]  for people to get bashed in the face for a living.
[49:48.900 --> 49:51.980]  Rugby players, people on boxers, soccer players.
[49:52.020 --> 49:53.660]  Research is taking place right now.
[49:53.660 --> 49:55.980]  So you feel that on their off season
[49:55.980 --> 49:56.820]  is what I'm asking about now.
[49:56.820 --> 49:58.380]  You feel that those guys should be allowed
[49:58.380 --> 50:01.300]  to consume cannabis, medical or recreational.
[50:01.300 --> 50:02.140]  Oh, for sure.
[50:02.140 --> 50:03.820]  On their, during the off season,
[50:03.820 --> 50:06.060]  as much as they'd like, right?
[50:06.060 --> 50:08.740]  They can drink alcohol, all it takes and call it.
[50:08.740 --> 50:10.300]  Okay, in any state?
[50:10.300 --> 50:11.140]  They're adults.
[50:11.140 --> 50:12.460]  In all 50 states?
[50:12.460 --> 50:13.500]  If I was king of the world,
[50:13.500 --> 50:15.140]  it would have been legal for everybody a long time ago.
[50:15.140 --> 50:16.300]  Okay, I agree with that.
[50:16.300 --> 50:18.900]  Yeah, Rastafari, no Babylon, let's let everybody smoke.
[50:18.900 --> 50:19.860]  You got that right.
[50:19.860 --> 50:22.140]  So, okay, so then I'm sure you're going to say
[50:22.140 --> 50:23.300]  that yes to this one also.
[50:23.300 --> 50:25.460]  Do you think that these guys,
[50:25.460 --> 50:27.700]  and I'll ask about specific sports after I generalize,
[50:27.700 --> 50:29.060]  we'll just, we'll kind of narrow it down.
[50:29.060 --> 50:30.540]  Do you think that professional athletes
[50:30.540 --> 50:33.700]  should be able to consume cannabis during the on season?
[50:33.700 --> 50:35.300]  Like the night after a game,
[50:35.300 --> 50:37.140]  maybe the day before a game?
[50:37.140 --> 50:38.740]  Maybe, what if you're a better,
[50:38.740 --> 50:41.740]  what if you're a better player when you smoke a fat joint?
[50:41.740 --> 50:42.780]  Should they be able to play,
[50:42.780 --> 50:44.940]  should they be able to smoke right before the game?
[50:44.940 --> 50:47.780]  Okay, that would be a performance enhancing drug.
[50:47.780 --> 50:49.940]  But how many other performance enhancing drugs
[50:49.940 --> 50:51.780]  are those other football players using?
[50:51.780 --> 50:52.620]  Well, seeing that this-
[50:52.620 --> 50:55.180]  Dude, cannabis is so not a performance enhancing drug.
[50:55.180 --> 50:56.980]  I just said that jokingly.
[50:56.980 --> 50:58.180]  But kind of is if you're-
[50:58.180 --> 51:00.420]  Well, no, they're legitimately testing people
[51:00.420 --> 51:01.900]  as though it's steroids.
[51:01.900 --> 51:02.740]  Right, that's-
[51:02.740 --> 51:04.860]  And that when they're looking for steroids,
[51:04.860 --> 51:08.140]  they also look for pot as though they're the same.
[51:08.140 --> 51:09.140]  And that's nuts.
[51:09.140 --> 51:11.660]  Like at best, it's helping you focus,
[51:11.660 --> 51:13.980]  or keeping you from being in pain while you,
[51:13.980 --> 51:14.980]  you know what I mean?
[51:14.980 --> 51:17.180]  It's not making you stronger or faster.
[51:17.580 --> 51:18.420]  Building your muscles up,
[51:18.420 --> 51:21.700]  it's not increasing your adrenaline, it's-
[51:21.700 --> 51:23.540]  But I have absolutely no issues with people using-
[51:23.540 --> 51:25.060]  It's stopping you from being inflamed.
[51:25.060 --> 51:25.900]  Right.
[51:25.900 --> 51:26.740]  Yeah, okay.
[51:26.740 --> 51:29.100]  I have absolutely no issues with people consuming cannabis
[51:29.100 --> 51:30.340]  when they're not at work.
[51:30.340 --> 51:31.260]  Okay.
[51:31.260 --> 51:33.420]  Like there are a lot of people who do shit that's kind of,
[51:33.420 --> 51:34.700]  well, that's what I'm thinking about sports.
[51:34.700 --> 51:36.700]  Like football players crashing other people
[51:36.700 --> 51:37.980]  at high speeds. With their bodies.
[51:37.980 --> 51:38.820]  Yeah.
[51:38.820 --> 51:39.660]  And there's a lot of power there.
[51:39.660 --> 51:41.700]  Like that needs to be precisely controlled
[51:41.700 --> 51:43.260]  or somebody's gonna die.
[51:43.260 --> 51:45.340]  And like, I'm down for us to go watch people
[51:45.340 --> 51:47.220]  kill each other, but we need to give them like swords
[51:47.220 --> 51:49.420]  and just call it gladiatorial fights.
[51:49.420 --> 51:50.740]  Like, how are we gonna go that route?
[51:50.740 --> 51:52.820]  Like getting football players intoxicated
[51:52.820 --> 51:53.900]  and letting them rush at each other
[51:53.900 --> 51:55.220]  is not how we get there.
[51:55.220 --> 51:56.900]  That's gonna be one of the things people tweet about
[51:56.900 --> 51:57.740]  on episode 100.
[51:57.740 --> 51:59.100]  Probably.
[51:59.100 --> 52:00.300]  Bring back gladiators.
[52:00.300 --> 52:01.420]  We like Mike's point.
[52:01.420 --> 52:03.620]  And me saying that people own people,
[52:03.620 --> 52:05.180]  that'll be the other thing that I hear about it.
[52:05.180 --> 52:06.060]  I didn't mean it like that.
[52:06.060 --> 52:07.340]  I'm sorry.
[52:07.340 --> 52:09.380]  I made a faux pas and I apologize now.
[52:09.380 --> 52:10.540]  I realized what I said.
[52:10.540 --> 52:12.140]  It's not what I fucking did.
[52:12.140 --> 52:14.060]  It's not what I meant at all.
[52:14.060 --> 52:16.300]  Sometimes we step in a trap.
[52:16.300 --> 52:17.980]  Words are hard these days.
[52:17.980 --> 52:18.820]  Yes.
[52:18.820 --> 52:19.820]  I'm politically erect.
[52:19.820 --> 52:21.700]  Well, everything means 11 things.
[52:21.700 --> 52:22.540]  Yes.
[52:22.540 --> 52:23.380]  Exactly.
[52:23.380 --> 52:24.220]  All right.
[52:24.220 --> 52:25.620]  So we all think that sports athletes,
[52:25.620 --> 52:26.900]  the professional athletes should be able
[52:26.900 --> 52:27.740]  to consume cannabis.
[52:27.740 --> 52:29.500]  They're allowed to drink alcohol if they so choose.
[52:29.500 --> 52:30.340]  Yeah.
[52:30.340 --> 52:32.060]  And in Colorado, we have pretty much put the same rules
[52:32.060 --> 52:34.380]  on booze or on the same rules on cannabis.
[52:34.380 --> 52:37.980]  That's exactly what they mirrored off of.
[52:37.980 --> 52:38.820]  Yeah.
[52:38.820 --> 52:40.300]  They can, most of us can go out after a hard day
[52:40.300 --> 52:41.180]  of whatever we do.
[52:41.180 --> 52:42.220]  And we don't, how many,
[52:42.220 --> 52:44.500]  how many other people slam into other people all day
[52:44.500 --> 52:45.780]  for a damn living?
[52:45.780 --> 52:48.580]  Like, why can't these people go smoke a little bit of reefer
[52:48.580 --> 52:51.500]  if their buddies can smoke, can drink some beers?
[52:51.500 --> 52:53.100]  I can't, I can't drink beer.
[52:53.100 --> 52:53.940]  Beer is no good for me.
[52:53.940 --> 52:56.620]  Beer does nothing good for me, but smoking cannabis,
[52:56.620 --> 52:59.420]  I have plenty of medicinal value and plenty of benefits.
[52:59.420 --> 53:00.260]  Yep.
[53:00.260 --> 53:02.100]  So I don't go drink beer after work like several people do.
[53:02.100 --> 53:02.940]  And I'm not judging.
[53:02.940 --> 53:03.900]  I'm just saying that doesn't work for me.
[53:03.900 --> 53:04.740]  Yeah.
[53:04.740 --> 53:06.460]  I come home and smoke some weed, smoke some dabs,
[53:06.460 --> 53:07.300]  and it works wonderfully.
[53:07.300 --> 53:08.620]  We should have an alternative.
[53:08.620 --> 53:09.780]  I agree.
[53:09.780 --> 53:10.620]  Yeah.
[53:10.620 --> 53:11.460]  Completely.
[53:12.060 --> 53:14.580]  And it shouldn't have to be confined
[53:16.140 --> 53:17.620]  to places where
[53:20.100 --> 53:21.020]  you can't be seen.
[53:21.020 --> 53:21.860]  Absolutely.
[53:21.860 --> 53:23.980]  Where you have to hide.
[53:23.980 --> 53:27.420]  Adults like to gather and enjoy intoxicants
[53:27.420 --> 53:28.700]  with other adults.
[53:28.700 --> 53:29.940]  It's the way it's always been.
[53:29.940 --> 53:33.100]  I mean, it's literally the way it's always been.
[53:33.100 --> 53:34.860]  You're taxing us for it.
[53:34.860 --> 53:36.180]  Give us some more to consume it.
[53:36.180 --> 53:39.060]  The first humans around the first fire got there,
[53:39.060 --> 53:41.100]  like they gathered to get fucked up around it.
[53:41.260 --> 53:42.860]  That's just how humans work.
[53:43.820 --> 53:46.300]  Throughout history, there's always been a tavern
[53:46.300 --> 53:49.300]  or I mean, in different parts of the country.
[53:49.300 --> 53:51.700]  It's the street corner or-
[53:51.700 --> 53:52.540]  In many cultures.
[53:52.540 --> 53:53.380]  Yep.
[53:53.380 --> 53:56.500]  This is where people get together and enjoy intoxicants.
[53:56.500 --> 53:59.060]  And yeah, having a place where people can go
[53:59.060 --> 54:01.620]  and consume pot together.
[54:01.620 --> 54:02.500]  Those are necessary.
[54:02.500 --> 54:03.380]  We need to get on it.
[54:03.380 --> 54:04.220]  Yeah.
[54:04.220 --> 54:05.060]  Yes, we sure do.
[54:05.060 --> 54:05.900]  That would be great.
[54:05.900 --> 54:06.980]  The whole country needs places.
[54:06.980 --> 54:08.860]  One or two or three or four in every state
[54:08.860 --> 54:11.060]  where we can all just meet and have little puff sessions.
[54:12.060 --> 54:14.420]  E-mails, dab rigs, it'd be awesome.
[54:14.420 --> 54:15.620]  And not be harassed.
[54:15.620 --> 54:16.660]  Not be harassed by the police.
[54:16.660 --> 54:17.500]  That's all we want, you guys,
[54:17.500 --> 54:19.500]  is just to be able to smoke cannabis peacefully
[54:19.500 --> 54:21.540]  and hang out and socialize.
[54:21.540 --> 54:23.300]  There won't be as many problems as you have
[54:23.300 --> 54:25.260]  with alcohol consumption facilities.
[54:26.140 --> 54:27.700]  Snowing people don't wanna fight.
[54:27.700 --> 54:28.540]  No.
[54:28.540 --> 54:29.380]  No.
[54:29.380 --> 54:30.300]  No.
[54:30.300 --> 54:31.140]  No.
[54:31.140 --> 54:32.820]  We can all get pretty heated in this room.
[54:32.820 --> 54:34.860]  We have some arguing beliefs between us.
[54:34.860 --> 54:36.580]  I'm sure we can find something we disagree about.
[54:36.580 --> 54:37.420]  It's the one big flaw in Dazed and Confused.
[54:37.420 --> 54:40.100]  Nobody in this room is gonna swing at anybody.
[54:40.140 --> 54:41.580]  There was beer in Dazed and Confused.
[54:41.580 --> 54:43.260]  Right, they were drinking at the time too.
[54:43.260 --> 54:44.740]  He wanted to fight because he was out of beer.
[54:44.740 --> 54:46.540]  I've watched that movie with a number of people
[54:46.540 --> 54:49.780]  for the first time, and typically that's the one comment
[54:49.780 --> 54:51.380]  that gets made through the whole film is like,
[54:51.380 --> 54:52.620]  why is he aggressive?
[54:52.620 --> 54:53.740]  He was just smoking weed.
[54:53.740 --> 54:54.860]  Was his weed bad?
[54:54.860 --> 54:56.980]  Now that dude was drinking.
[54:56.980 --> 54:58.740]  He came there to drink beer and kick ass
[54:58.740 --> 54:59.740]  or something like that.
[54:59.740 --> 55:00.580]  Right.
[55:00.580 --> 55:01.420]  And they were all out of beer.
[55:02.860 --> 55:04.740]  All right, so we're gonna start wrapping up the show.
[55:04.740 --> 55:06.180]  Man, I really appreciate you guys for coming.
[55:06.180 --> 55:08.380]  Doug, you got anything else you wanna add to us?
[55:10.300 --> 55:13.380]  Yeah, keep medicated, keep healthy.
[55:13.380 --> 55:14.300]  There you go.
[55:14.300 --> 55:16.420]  Fuck, we should just hit stop.
[55:17.940 --> 55:19.100]  Drop the mic.
[55:19.100 --> 55:20.260]  Yeah, dude, damn.
[55:20.260 --> 55:21.100]  That was perfect.
[55:21.100 --> 55:22.420]  Points.
[55:22.420 --> 55:24.900]  I feel like we didn't give enough credit to edibles.
[55:24.900 --> 55:27.340]  There's a lot of really wonderful edible products
[55:27.340 --> 55:29.540]  on the market right now that you should definitely
[55:29.540 --> 55:30.780]  check out if you can.
[55:32.100 --> 55:33.860]  What would you recommend to somebody?
[55:33.860 --> 55:36.980]  Chibuchu's just fucking went recreational
[55:36.980 --> 55:38.380]  and I'm way excited about that.
[55:38.380 --> 55:39.860]  I'm so sick of telling people,
[55:39.860 --> 55:41.300]  no, they're not recreational yet.
[55:41.300 --> 55:43.260]  They're recreational now.
[55:43.260 --> 55:44.660]  You can look for them on store shelves
[55:44.660 --> 55:46.140]  at your rec shops in Colorado.
[55:46.140 --> 55:47.460]  So if you guys are out of state,
[55:47.460 --> 55:50.460]  if you're anywhere in the world and you're 21 and up,
[55:50.460 --> 55:52.660]  you can come to Colorado,
[55:52.660 --> 55:55.420]  fly to either Colorado Springs or Denver.
[55:55.420 --> 55:58.300]  Fly to Denver and drive, fuck the Colorado Springs Airport.
[55:58.300 --> 56:00.020]  Denver Airport's gonna take you two and a half
[56:00.020 --> 56:02.620]  to three hours to get to our dispensary.
[56:02.620 --> 56:03.460]  Come on down.
[56:04.420 --> 56:06.980]  Tell everybody that you heard about the spot dispensary
[56:06.980 --> 56:09.060]  on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[56:09.060 --> 56:11.420]  Grab yourself some Chibuchu's
[56:11.420 --> 56:13.980]  and grab yourself some quality flour.
[56:15.300 --> 56:16.420]  And then what else should they grab
[56:16.420 --> 56:17.260]  while they're at the shop?
[56:17.260 --> 56:18.100]  If they're coming.
[56:18.100 --> 56:18.940]  Whatever they want.
[56:18.940 --> 56:20.420]  That's the beauty of legalization
[56:20.420 --> 56:21.980]  is you have a huge selection.
[56:21.980 --> 56:23.380]  Something will catch your eye in there.
[56:23.380 --> 56:25.740]  Oh my gosh, there's so much stuff in there.
[56:25.740 --> 56:27.300]  But come check out a Chibuchu, you guys.
[56:27.300 --> 56:29.380]  Come get, if you wanna get like kinda high
[56:29.380 --> 56:30.860]  and be like trippy dippy,
[56:30.860 --> 56:32.900]  get like a Sativa Chibuchu.
[56:32.900 --> 56:34.540]  They're one of the first edible companies
[56:34.540 --> 56:38.060]  to really nail the Sativa Indica hybrid.
[56:38.060 --> 56:38.900]  Yes.
[56:38.900 --> 56:40.180]  And they've got a CBD chew now
[56:40.180 --> 56:41.980]  that I'm just waiting to test.
[56:41.980 --> 56:42.820]  I've just been going.
[56:42.820 --> 56:44.500]  I wanna try that because I love Chibuchu.
[56:44.500 --> 56:46.900]  I saw them get delivered just a few days ago.
[56:46.900 --> 56:48.660]  The Chibuchu guy was there, yes.
[56:48.660 --> 56:50.620]  So if you wanna get kinda trippy, get the Sativa.
[56:50.620 --> 56:53.140]  If you wanna mellow out and giggle, get the Indica.
[56:53.140 --> 56:55.180]  The Indica are intense, that's what I eat.
[56:55.180 --> 56:56.660]  If you want a kind of a balanced high,
[56:56.660 --> 56:57.500]  get those hybrids.
[56:57.500 --> 56:58.660]  Go to the movies.
[56:58.660 --> 57:00.660]  Take a hybrid and go to the movies.
[57:00.660 --> 57:02.180]  If you're just looking for straight pain relief
[57:02.180 --> 57:03.380]  and you don't wanna feel high,
[57:03.380 --> 57:04.420]  if you don't want anybody to know
[57:04.420 --> 57:06.020]  that you're consuming cannabis for pain relief,
[57:06.020 --> 57:06.860]  get the CBD.
[57:06.860 --> 57:08.100]  That's what CBD chews for.
[57:08.100 --> 57:09.900]  Yeah, they don't make you head high.
[57:09.900 --> 57:10.740]  They don't make you giggly.
[57:10.740 --> 57:11.980]  They just make you feel better.
[57:11.980 --> 57:13.220]  So you've got an option.
[57:13.220 --> 57:15.460]  So come to Colorado, come get some Chibuchus,
[57:15.460 --> 57:16.700]  check it out, see what they do for you.
[57:16.700 --> 57:18.380]  Maybe don't take them home.
[57:18.380 --> 57:19.220]  Keep them while you're in Colorado.
[57:19.220 --> 57:20.060]  Keep them here.
[57:20.060 --> 57:20.900]  Keep them here.
[57:20.900 --> 57:21.740]  Joey there?
[57:21.740 --> 57:22.560]  Do what?
[57:22.560 --> 57:23.400]  I heard a little Coco there.
[57:23.400 --> 57:24.340]  Some Joey Diaz?
[57:24.340 --> 57:25.180]  Yup.
[57:25.180 --> 57:26.020]  Uh-oh, some Chibuchus, dog.
[57:26.020 --> 57:28.060]  When you said Chibuchus the second time,
[57:28.060 --> 57:28.900]  you couldn't help it.
[57:28.900 --> 57:30.300]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, subconsciously,
[57:30.300 --> 57:31.940]  Joey Coco Diaz is one of my heroes.
[57:31.940 --> 57:32.940]  And I guess subconsciously,
[57:32.940 --> 57:34.780]  Joey Diaz just slipped out of me.
[57:34.780 --> 57:37.620]  All right, dog, so go get some Chibuchus, dog.
[57:37.620 --> 57:39.860]  All right, dog, I got these stars of death, dog.
[57:39.860 --> 57:40.780]  Yeah, Joey's my hero.
[57:40.780 --> 57:41.700]  Shout out to Joey Diaz.
[57:41.700 --> 57:43.460]  Come back to Colorado, man, if you're listening to this.
[57:43.460 --> 57:45.180]  Joey Diaz, come back to Colorado, please.
[57:45.180 --> 57:46.660]  I'd love to come see you again.
[57:46.660 --> 57:47.500]  I miss you, bro.
[57:47.500 --> 57:48.780]  Yeah, Joey Diaz, check him out.
[57:48.780 --> 57:51.920]  Joey Coco Diaz, hilarious as a motherfucker.
[57:51.920 --> 57:53.460]  All right, I don't think we have a lot else to say.
[57:53.460 --> 57:55.020]  We didn't give edibles enough credit.
[57:55.020 --> 57:55.860]  Edibles are awesome.
[57:55.860 --> 57:57.620]  They're very medicinal.
[57:57.620 --> 57:58.900]  They take a little bit longer to work,
[57:58.900 --> 58:00.540]  but when they do, boy, they really, really work.
[58:00.540 --> 58:02.540]  You have to plan a little better with edibles.
[58:02.540 --> 58:03.380]  Yeah.
[58:03.380 --> 58:04.820]  It's smoking so much simpler
[58:04.820 --> 58:07.740]  because you can titrate your dose really, really well.
[58:07.740 --> 58:10.180]  You know how hard what you just took
[58:10.180 --> 58:11.740]  is gonna hit you immediately.
[58:11.740 --> 58:13.620]  If you want a little more, you can take a little more.
[58:13.620 --> 58:14.860]  If you're good, you're good.
[58:14.860 --> 58:16.260]  You know that.
[58:16.260 --> 58:18.640]  With edibles, it takes an hour and a half to kick in,
[58:18.640 --> 58:19.940]  and you can't uneat drugs.
[58:19.940 --> 58:20.780]  Yeah.
[58:20.780 --> 58:22.420]  Which is a bonus if you can't sleep.
[58:22.420 --> 58:24.780]  Eat yourself some edibles and then get stoned,
[58:24.780 --> 58:25.780]  and then try to go to bed,
[58:25.780 --> 58:27.020]  and then hopefully you're sleeping,
[58:27.020 --> 58:28.160]  and those edibles will kick in
[58:28.160 --> 58:30.320]  while you're sleeping and keep you asleep through the night.
[58:30.320 --> 58:33.880]  That's what I've been doing with edibles all summer long.
[58:33.880 --> 58:35.560]  I'll get a hundred milligram package
[58:35.560 --> 58:38.840]  and eat like 10 milligrams at eight,
[58:38.840 --> 58:42.800]  10 milligrams at nine, 20 at 10, and 20 at 11,
[58:42.800 --> 58:44.300]  and then when I go to bed,
[58:44.300 --> 58:46.520]  they're kicking in for the first few hours I'm asleep.
[58:46.520 --> 58:47.360]  Sweet.
[58:47.360 --> 58:48.800]  Yeah, get that metabolism moving.
[58:48.800 --> 58:49.640]  There you go.
[58:49.640 --> 58:50.800]  And then have a full night's rest.
[58:50.800 --> 58:51.640]  Yep.
[58:51.640 --> 58:53.880]  Wake up eight hours later feeling great.
[58:53.880 --> 58:57.000]  So let's quickly, we've talked about dabs and smoking,
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.240]  dabs and flowers, we've talked about edibles,
[58:59.240 --> 59:03.080]  we talked about tinctures, we talked about your vape pen.
[59:03.080 --> 59:05.560]  We've kind of left out like rubs and creams
[59:05.560 --> 59:06.780]  is all I think that's left.
[59:06.780 --> 59:08.840]  And I've got one other product that we could talk about
[59:08.840 --> 59:09.780]  if we have a couple seconds,
[59:09.780 --> 59:12.000]  but you've looked like you got something to say about it.
[59:12.000 --> 59:13.800]  No, when you said rubs and creams,
[59:13.800 --> 59:17.080]  I've talked to some people in my age bracket
[59:17.080 --> 59:19.720]  that are using some of the creams for arthritis,
[59:19.720 --> 59:21.640]  and swear by them,
[59:21.640 --> 59:25.320]  think it's the best thing since sliced bread.
[59:25.320 --> 59:27.160]  I did not take them seriously.
[59:27.160 --> 59:29.700]  And then a friend of mine gave me a bottle as a sample,
[59:29.700 --> 59:31.760]  and I gave somebody a massage,
[59:31.760 --> 59:33.360]  just from the shoulders to the mid back
[59:33.360 --> 59:34.640]  is all she let me do.
[59:34.640 --> 59:38.720]  But by then, my fingers felt fluffy.
[59:38.720 --> 59:39.560]  Wow.
[59:39.560 --> 59:40.960]  Like I felt like I was wearing balloon gloves.
[59:40.960 --> 59:42.280]  So now I take it seriously.
[59:42.280 --> 59:44.560]  And she was like, wow, that was like a huge massage.
[59:44.560 --> 59:45.760]  And I was like, it's that apothecary,
[59:45.760 --> 59:48.040]  it was apothecary pain cream is what I used.
[59:48.040 --> 59:50.880]  And I definitely give the pains and saps credit.
[59:50.880 --> 59:53.480]  Now I did not before, but after that, I believe,
[59:53.480 --> 59:54.320]  I'm a believer.
[59:54.320 --> 59:55.160]  Yeah.
[59:56.000 --> 59:58.680]  It was one of the first generation topical lotions
[59:58.680 --> 59:59.520]  in Colorado,
[59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.200]  just random lotion in a bottle
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.440]  with like a company sticker on it.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.360]  I don't remember what the brand was,
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.700]  but I use it for after trimming to help absorb
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.680]  the rest of the trichomes off my skin
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.280]  that I couldn't get washed off.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.680]  And it worked wonderful for that,
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.080]  but it would also help ease the pain from trimming.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:14.920]  Wow.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.160]  I mean, you spend seven, eight hours scissoring
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.440]  like a madman,
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.680]  your fingers cramp up,
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.560]  one hand's holding a little stem all night, all day,
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.300]  and the other one's working a pair of scissors
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:25.140]  for that whole shift.
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:25.980]  It hurts.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:26.800]  Yeah.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.700]  And that pain cream, I mean, an hour after I used it,
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.660]  I felt like I hadn't been at work all day.
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:31.940]  It was great.
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:33.900]  Shout out to the ladies that trimmed my weed for me
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:34.720]  the other night.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:35.740]  Oh, well done, ladies.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.580]  Yeah. Good job.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.500]  Good job.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.740]  So we've covered,
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:41.300]  it seems like we've covered 90% of the consumption methods.
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.980]  Have either of you guys tried,
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:44.340]  Mike's had some teas.
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.180]  Did those work?
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.100]  Did they have any medicinal value?
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.620]  The teas that I was really into,
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:50.920]  most of that,
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.940]  I mean, the dose was so low
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.500]  and the quality was so sketchy back then
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.580]  that it was probably just a good flavor tea
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.540]  that I liked paying $5 a bag for.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.660]  Okay.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.940]  But there's a couple of teas on the market
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.220]  that people swear by.
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:05.740]  I haven't tried them yet.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.660]  I'm still working my way down the edible case.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:08.500]  Nice.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.340]  How about a transdermal patch?
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.420]  Have you tried one of those yet?
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.160]  I have a friend who did,
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.900]  in an effort to treat fibromyalgia with a CBD patch,
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.940]  and she said it worked, but not as well as smoking.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:21.780]  Okay.
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:23.260]  She really likes,
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:26.820]  she's got a CBD oil cartridge for her vape pen
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.500]  that she really, really likes.
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.660]  So for fibromyalgia myself,
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.380]  used to be on Lyrica.
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.220]  Okay.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.420]  Yeah, about 9,000 side effects on the commercial?
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.700]  You know, when they're all smiling
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.220]  and talking about anal drainage and stuff, yeah.
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.060]  Yeah.
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:47.260]  But then again,
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.020]  this is one of the drugs that I got rid of.
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:50.840]  Excellent.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.800]  Started using the concentrates on a regular basis.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.800]  From medicine that myself and the Garden of Weden produce.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.640]  There we go.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.600]  Damn, that feels good.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.420]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.260]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.080]  That makes me proud.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:02.920]  Thank you, sir.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.200]  Lyrica has gone out of your diet
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.720]  because of things that Spence and I do.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.240]  Spence, I hope you hear that, bro.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.560]  Lyrica, methadone, somas.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.400]  Holy shit.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.080]  All out of the, no more.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.440]  You know, this may be too much,
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.040]  but a while back when I'd go visit you,
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.720]  sometimes you'd be fucking out of it, dude.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.560]  Yeah, I'm sure I was.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.160]  And lately you've been sharp.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.440]  You've been Douglas again, which is cool.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.480]  And it is cool to be yourself again.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.960]  And not under a haze of medication.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:31.920]  You can find the remote now.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.600]  You can find your phone now.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.440]  And you don't want the remote as much now
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.880]  because you want to go out and do something.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.720]  Nice.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.640]  Because you've got energy again.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:40.480]  There you go.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.200]  You know, you've got mobility again.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.120]  I wish you guys could see the look on Doug's face.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.360]  He's sincere as fuck, dude.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.760]  He's not bullshitting at all.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.600]  Oh no.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.440]  And he's a motherfucker.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.400]  It just dials back every other part of your life.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.640]  Right, dude, I've got a tiny, tiny boo-boo on my finger
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.960]  and it's been fucking up my whole week.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.920]  It's just a tiny boo-boo.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.600]  I could imagine, I mean, I've got some pain,
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.440]  but I can imagine having like hip pain at your age.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.360]  Like, God damn, I'm going to feel like I'm falling apart.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.440]  And it's not just like when my knees really start throbbing,
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.960]  it's not just the knee.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.720]  It's the muscles on either side of it tense up
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.280]  trying to protect it.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.480]  And then you walk a little funny trying to protect it.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.360]  And by the end of the day,
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.480]  everything below your nipples is sore
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.200]  because it's trying to keep your knee
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.520]  from being really sore.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.360]  Right.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.480]  And then living like that for weeks and months on end,
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.040]  you just become exhausted.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.400]  And after years, you start walking different.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.760]  You start living different.
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.960]  It affects you greatly.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.000]  And when you can't think of anything else except pain,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.280]  when it's like a high note right between your ears,
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.840]  and that's all that you can do is hear that scream
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.160]  that your mind is giving,
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.240]  hey, we're hurting.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.080]  Yeah.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.160]  You know, do something.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.040]  Sometimes it changes it up.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.920]  Not enough you can do at that point, right?
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.760]  No.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.880]  Sometimes it's just, you gotta fucking live with that.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.200]  Curl up and bite the bullet
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.760]  until something you can do to give some relief.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.640]  You know, sometimes heat, sometimes cold,
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.080]  sometimes pharmaceutical medicines.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.880]  Right, so many people go to alcohol for that.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.720]  Oh, well, look it.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.560]  And that's so fucked up.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.160]  You know, what we've seen since the beginning of alcohol.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.720]  Right, yeah.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.960]  People have always, I remember my grandparents
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.600]  would talk about, they'd take their shot and go,
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.320]  that's our medicine for the night.
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.480]  At the end of their lives, however,
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.000]  they wished that, at least that's what they told me,
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.520]  was that they wished they had quit that
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.880]  earlier in their life.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.720]  Yeah.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.680]  And that's one of the reasons I stopped earlier in my life.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.520]  I'm glad you did,
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.360]  because I like the way you are.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.920]  I'm not sure we'd get along if you drank.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.440]  No, no, you wouldn't like me.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.640]  Nobody would like me if I drank.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.680]  We're so much alike, Doug.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.520]  We're so much alike.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.040]  That's why we're such good bros.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.720]  And I'm sure that I was a lot like you were when I drank.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.560]  Yeah.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.400]  Yeah.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.760]  And we're a lot like each other that we don't.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.920]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.760]  Fist bump, bro.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.600]  Got it.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.440]  Every day.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.800]  So there's one more way of consumption that I can think of
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.200]  that we have not talked about that I have tried.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.800]  Mike's looking at me like, fuck.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.160]  Oh, the lube?
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.680]  The lube, bro, the lube.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:10.640]  So I work at a dispensary and I got some lube, dude.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.360]  It's called Evos, I believe.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:16.520]  There's a couple of different companies that make it.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.960]  Aria is the main one, and then we carry Evos.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.800]  Okay, then it's Evos,
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.320]  because I got it from the spot dispensary.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.440]  Free sample day.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.840]  I didn't get high at all from it,
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.800]  but yeah, Doug's looking at me like, that kind of lube?
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:28.640]  Yeah, dude, that kind of lube.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.760]  No, no, it never makes sense.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.440]  That's the nice thing about topicals
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.440]  is there's not an intoxication with them.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.280]  Right.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.560]  It's just a medical effect.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.960]  So the instruction said like spray three to four sprays
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.120]  on her.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.000]  So I went with like eight because, you know.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  Double up.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.160]  Yeah, just, and it wasn't spraying that much.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.720]  So I just like spraying it on there.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.280]  And then it totally had sex with this chick
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:53.920]  and it felt warm and tingly and like hot.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.480]  It was like hotter than normal.
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.320]  Like the temperature was higher
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:00.680]  and it took a little more effort to finish up,
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.520]  to tell you the truth.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.600]  Like I had to like wrap it up.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.080]  I was like, okay, let me try a little harder.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.080]  I think you did a big review of this on a previous show.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:07.920]  Yeah, we kind of did.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.760]  But we also did a review of what happens
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.360]  when I smoke too much CBD and I can't finish up at all.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.920]  We talked about that as well.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.280]  What's the base substance of the spray?
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.200]  It's coconut oil.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.120]  Yeah, coconut oil.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.680]  And then they infuse it with THC.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.200]  They just, I pretty much think they put coconut oil
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.920]  in a crock pot and throw a bunch of bud in there
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.400]  and then strain out the bud.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.680]  Is what I really think they do.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.720]  Would not be surprised to find that that's the recipe.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.040]  Dude, I sprayed some in my hand and tasted it.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.800]  I was like, this is just coconut oil with weed in it.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.920]  The ingredients are coconut oil and cannabis.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.080]  Two products Jeff is highly familiar with.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:38.920]  Yeah, I know.
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.600]  Oh, look at all about the coconut oil.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.040]  Looks live on coconut oil.
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.040]  It's good for everything, dude.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.040]  If your hands are all sticky
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.960]  and you can't get the resin off your hands from trimming,
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:50.200]  little bit of coconut oil will take that shit right off.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.040]  Real quick.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.520]  Yep, a million and one uses.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.800]  That's the first one I'll tell you about.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.640]  Some of the other ones you don't even wanna know.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.480]  Nope.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.880]  All right, so we're gonna start wrapping up this show.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.400]  I tried to do it earlier, but we've got so much shit to say.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.160]  I think we've covered all ways
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.960]  that I am familiar with consuming cannabis.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.520]  We did touch on children,
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.400]  about people coming here and getting scammed.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.240]  We kinda talked about that a little bit, yeah.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.560]  I would just like to make a quick point
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.480]  because I know someone who has a special needs child,
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.520]  seizures, multiple times throughout the day,
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.840]  finally was able to get medication.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:24.680]  Great.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:29.040]  And has changed their life 180 degrees around.
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.800]  I mean, if you don't believe in this stuff,
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.280]  you need to come and see what it does.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:36.040]  If you're worried about the children,
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.360]  worry about the ones that need this medication
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.560]  and can't get it.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:44.560]  Because it's made this, not just this child's life,
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:49.320]  much happier, enjoyable, productive.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.920]  But if you've ever been a caregiver
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.280]  of someone who suffers from something,
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.640]  you realize that that ripple expands out there far.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.480]  Oh, far.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.840]  And when you give relief to the one
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.200]  that everyone cares so much about,
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.160]  that ripple expands and gives relief
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.280]  to everyone that cares about them.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.200]  Absolutely.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.040]  Yep.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.480]  If you're a family moving here with a kid,
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.680]  looking for CBD oil,
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.200]  or if you're just moving here looking for CBD oil,
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.680]  take your time to hunt down legit products.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.800]  Yes.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.520]  There are a lot of places we,
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:23.120]  or Jeff talked about a news article recently
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.800]  that there's hemp extract oil being sent from China.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.480]  If you can buy it online and have it shipped to you,
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.120]  it's not the real thing.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.160]  If you can get it outside of a dispensary,
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.320]  you have to be standing in in Colorado.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.720]  There's a 50, 50 chance it's not the real thing.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.360]  That's the truth.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.600]  If you're lucky and you live in another state
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:48.080]  that has a really solid medical marijuana program
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:52.080]  and lab testing for cannabinoids is required,
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.080]  you should be able to get the lab test
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.000]  right there with your product.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.560]  You can check and see what you're buying
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.160]  right there in the store.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.200]  If you can't, be a little sketched out
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.840]  that you're buying stuff from a store
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:03.920]  that doesn't come with that,
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:08.040]  that should be standard now with legalization.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.800]  In Colorado, if they don't have the lab test,
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.840]  they're full of shit.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.160]  It's just that simple.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.160]  Yeah, he's right.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.240]  He's telling the truth.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.880]  If it's a legal product in Colorado,
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.320]  you have to have it lab tested.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.720]  If the store clerk tells you
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.720]  they don't have the lab test, they're lying.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.240]  Yeah, they just don't want you to see something.
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.160]  Yeah, they don't want you to see
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.920]  that they've got at least 13% THC or whatever.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.240]  Or they're being lazy and don't want to grab it.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.480]  But yeah, it's standard information now.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.840]  You should be able to find CBD meds
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.320]  in a range of ratios with THC,
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.640]  anywhere from like 100 to one CBD to THC
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:49.640]  to one to one and two to one THC to CBD.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.640]  There should be a good selection available to you.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.760]  You just have to take the time
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.720]  to find it from a legitimate dealer.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.240]  I hate seeing people come in here
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:59.440]  looking for what we've got
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:00.920]  and finding stuff that's fake.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.760]  That's just terrible.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.600]  Legitimate dealer.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.840]  You mean a dispensary.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.680]  Yep.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:05.520]  The word dealer in there made that
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.720]  a funny ass sentence in my mind.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.440]  I looked at Doug like, did you catch that at all?
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.840]  He said legitimate dealer.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.680]  Yep.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.560]  Yeah, we don't have dealers anymore.
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:12.400]  Retailer.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.760]  Yeah, legitimate retailer.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.840]  Storefront.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.720]  Your legitimate MMC.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.560]  Yep.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:18.400]  Yeah.
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.240]  MIPS number.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.080]  MIPS.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.320]  All right, yeah, just look for all that shit.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.440]  Make sure it's got a MIPS number and an OPC number.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.560]  It should have a lot of shit written on the container.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.720]  Way more than you're gonna want to read, but read it all.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:29.960]  Read those labels once in a while.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.440]  Check out, see what's going into the cannabis
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.560]  that you're buying from the dispensary.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.320]  There's so much interesting shit on the labels.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.160]  Yep.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.000]  Yeah, take your time.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.480]  Grab some of the pamphlets from the front too sometimes
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.560]  when they got those like informative brochures
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.040]  that tell you about what certain cannabinoids do.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:41.880]  Read that shit.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.720]  Inform yourself.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.560]  Stay informed.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.320]  Yeah, that's how people like, you know so much about weed.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.560]  I just read some shit.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.400]  Right.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.240]  I've got Google.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.960]  I didn't go to a magic weed school.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:50.800]  No.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.640]  I kind of did.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:52.480]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.320]  I kind of did.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.160]  Yeah, it was called life.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.000]  Yeah, all right.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:55.840]  So this time I think we're serious.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:58.040]  Anybody got any other methods of consumption?
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.320]  No, everybody went blank.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.440]  Any shout outs or anything you want to give?
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.520]  All right.
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.360]  We're all good.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.180]  Well, all right then.
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.240]  Make sure you guys follow Mike on Twitter.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.160]  It's at Nemo Punk 15.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.440]  Support the legalization of cannabis.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.280]  Please.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.120]  And listen to Mike.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.360]  He'll give you advice on how to do it on Twitter.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.000]  Mike is getting pretty popular there on the weed Twitter.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:17.960]  Oh, we bet.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:22.280]  Yeah, you guys next week dude is episode 100.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.400]  That's awesome.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.360]  We're going to party it up.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.760]  I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen.
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:27.420]  I'm going to invite six or eight people.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:30.000]  We're going to put about five microphones out on the table.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.520]  We're going to get down and have a good ass time.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.360]  We're going to take dabs.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.180]  We're going to play music.
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.200]  We're going to dance around.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.800]  We're going to be joyous stoners.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.480]  So what we're going to do, it's going to be a good ass time.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:39.320]  I love it.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.160]  I like that.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:40.980]  That's the way to be.
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:41.820]  That's the way to be.
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:42.660]  Yeah.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:43.480]  So I hope you guys join us for episode number 100.
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.080]  I appreciate you for joining us for episode number 99.
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:45.920]  This was a good time.
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:46.960]  I hope you like this guys.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.160]  You guys, thanks for coming out.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.480]  This was a great, great episode.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.320]  This was fun.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.520]  We need to get Doug on the show more often.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.720]  You've got so many things in your head
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.560]  that we need to get out.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.760]  It's just finding that trap door that leads to that story.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.540]  Sometimes it's like, hell yeah.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.180]  All right.
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:03.480]  If you guys are ever interested in sponsoring the podcast,
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.940]  or if you have a product you'd like me to review
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:06.280]  on the show, send me an email.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.520]  Mike and I would love to sit here and review some products.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.480]  You send us some stuff, we will unbox it on the show.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.680]  We will set it up.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:13.860]  We will try it out.
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.400]  Whatever it is, we'll take a dab out of it.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:16.740]  We'll ride it around.
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:17.600]  We'll fly on it.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.640]  We'll film something with it.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:19.760]  Whatever you want to send us.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.480]  Some sort of cannabis related product.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.640]  If you want us to check it out, a grinder,
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.440]  a storage container, whatever you got.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.720]  There's so many great products out there.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.760]  We will review it.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.760]  We'll shout it out.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.440]  This show gets over 5,000 downloads every single episode
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.040]  and the episodes stay up forever.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.640]  So if I talk about your product,
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.840]  if I advertise your product on episode number 101,
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.220]  it will be there forever.
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:41.060]  It doesn't go away.
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:42.080]  It's on the internet all the time.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.200]  People can listen to it.
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.280]  Every time I get a new listener,
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.880]  they go back and start at episode one.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.960]  So they'll hear your shit.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:47.840]  Yeah, for the most part.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.960]  Yeah, they do.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.280]  There's a good percentage of listeners
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.600]  if they hear the show at episode 80, whatever,
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.440]  they discover me then.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.000]  It's definitely worth going back through.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.760]  There's a lot of good info.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.440]  It's sometimes embarrassing thinking
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.280]  that people are going back and hearing number one
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.280]  when I'm like, hi, welcome to my show.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.120]  I'm all nervous.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.800]  But it's great.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.620]  I love it.
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:07.460]  If you guys want to find a good,
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.520]  if you're new to the podcast,
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.000]  make sure you listen to episode number 55.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.720]  I think that'll really introduce you to who I am
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.840]  and what I'm about and what my company is about.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.800]  55 is a great one.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.800]  I talk about iRegenetics, my seed company.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.320]  Kind of introduced myself pretty good at that point.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.440]  We are rambling at high.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.880]  We must've been smoking other jelly bean.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.720]  It is good sativa.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.560]  Dabs.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.440]  Dabs, dabs, dabs, more dabs.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.360]  All right, guys.

[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.960]  I would love your opinion.

[01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:42.990]  arm in each others arms so the wicked must bow.

[01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:14.010]  No, I'm good.
[01:21:14.010 --> 01:21:16.010]  I'm out there, you can find me.
[01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:18.010]  He's out there but he's not advertising.
[01:21:18.010 --> 01:21:21.010]  If anybody remembers, Joe is our photography guru.
[01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:24.010]  They came and taught us a bunch about improving our cannabis photography.
[01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:26.010]  He is back, he's joining us.
[01:21:26.010 --> 01:21:27.010]  So thanks for coming bro.
[01:21:27.010 --> 01:21:31.010]  A little bit closer to me is the beautiful Miss Maddie from the Garden of Weden.

[01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:40.010]  Thank you, I've got tea over here keeping me going.
[01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:42.010]  We weren't sure that Maddie was going to make it.
[01:21:42.010 --> 01:21:44.010]  She kind of sounded like a dude a couple of days ago.
[01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:46.010]  Hey, don't laugh at me.
[01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:47.010]  You sound much better.

[01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:54.010]  To my kind of front and right is the legend, the man, Mr. Garden of Weden himself.
[01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:55.010]  What's up, Spence?
[01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:56.010]  How you doing, brother?
[01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:57.010]  What's up, my nigga?
[01:21:57.010 --> 01:21:58.010]  Dude, thanks for coming, brother.
[01:21:58.010 --> 01:21:59.010]  I appreciate you being here.
[01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:00.010]  Anytime, anytime, dude.
[01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:03.010]  Dang, it's exciting to have all of these people here.
[01:22:03.010 --> 01:22:04.010]  This is the crew, you guys.
[01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:08.010]  We should have some like, I should have some cheering sound effects to hit on the computer right now
[01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:10.010]  because this is going to be awesome.
[01:22:10.010 --> 01:22:11.010]  It's episode 100.
[01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:18.010]  So I am right now currently cracking open a 100 milligram Incredibles pumpkin pie delight,
[01:22:18.010 --> 01:22:21.010]  pumpkin spice, and graham cracker edibles.
[01:22:21.010 --> 01:22:23.010]  This thing's got 100 milligrams.
[01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:25.010]  Shout out to my friend Craig for throwing this down.
[01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:26.010]  He said, eat this on episode 100.
[01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:27.010]  Enjoy it.
[01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:28.010]  Give me a shout out.
[01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:29.010]  So shout out to Craig if you listen to this.

[01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:31.010]  Thanks, Craig.
[01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:32.010]  Thank you, Craig.
[01:22:32.010 --> 01:22:35.010]  Yeah, also on the table, I've got an affogato.
[01:22:35.010 --> 01:22:36.010]  Is that how you say it?
[01:22:36.010 --> 01:22:37.010]  Affogato.
[01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:38.010]  Affogato bar.
[01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:42.010]  Also a pumpkin pie, pumpkin pie delight bar on the table.
[01:22:42.010 --> 01:22:46.010]  If anybody would like some pieces of these edibles, feel free to jump in, you guys.
[01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:49.010]  As long as I get like this much of this affogato, I'll be cool with life.
[01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:50.010]  No, get some.
[01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:51.010]  Get at it, you guys.
[01:22:51.010 --> 01:22:52.010]  Let's eat some edibles.
[01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:53.010]  We're going to get lit up.
[01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:56.010]  You can already hear Sloppy and Joe over there taking dabs.
[01:22:56.010 --> 01:22:58.010]  Before we go too far, let's mention.
[01:22:58.010 --> 01:23:00.010]  Yeah, Mike already kind of got me to it.
[01:23:00.010 --> 01:23:03.010]  The, okay, then I'm going to grab this one.
[01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:04.010]  Do it, Joe, do it.
[01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:05.010]  Do it.
[01:23:05.010 --> 01:23:06.010]  I'm claiming that piece, though.
[01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.010]  There is, what the hell was I going to say?
[01:23:08.010 --> 01:23:09.010]  Oh, the emails are hot.
[01:23:09.010 --> 01:23:10.010]  That's right.
[01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:12.010]  Fucking Sloppy and Joe are chilling at the furniture table over there.
[01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:14.010]  We got two emails built into the table.
[01:23:14.010 --> 01:23:19.010]  Shout out to my boy, Bobo Blaster Co. for sending me the dope ass table.
[01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:20.010]  These guys are getting dabbed the fuck out.
[01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:22.010]  I don't even think they're on the podcast.
[01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:25.010]  They're just over there taking dabs, eating edibles, and chilling like Beavis and Butthead.
[01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:26.010]  Crying.
[01:23:26.010 --> 01:23:27.010]  Crying.
[01:23:27.010 --> 01:23:28.010]  Auxiliary microphone team.
[01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:29.010]  Yes, I like it.
[01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:32.010]  They are sharing a microphone, and they are sexy with it.
[01:23:32.010 --> 01:23:33.010]  Go ahead.
[01:23:33.010 --> 01:23:34.010]  There you go.
[01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:35.010]  Nice.
[01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:36.010]  I'm going to dig into this freaking, let's see.
[01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:40.010]  I'm going to start with a bite of this affogato, so I think I'm going to need 120 milligrams
[01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:41.010]  to get started, probably.
[01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:42.010]  I'm loving that one.
[01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:44.010]  That was really yummy.
[01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:50.010]  It tastes like a Starbucks drink in a medical bar.
[01:23:50.010 --> 01:23:51.010]  It is exactly that, bro.
[01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:52.010]  It's delicious.
[01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:53.010]  Mike's grabbing the label for me.
[01:23:53.010 --> 01:23:54.010]  No, we taste-
[01:23:54.010 --> 01:24:01.010]  This is a 100 milligram bar from Incredibles, and the label reads affogato, vanilla latte,
[01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:04.010]  espresso beans, and caramel swirl, and it's fucking delicious.
[01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:05.010]  It is delicious.
[01:24:05.010 --> 01:24:06.010]  I'm digging this.
[01:24:06.010 --> 01:24:07.010]  It's really tasty.
[01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:10.010]  It's like a white chocolate cookies and cream bar with coffee beans in it.
[01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:11.010]  Yep.
[01:24:11.010 --> 01:24:12.010]  Yeah.
[01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:13.010]  Why are you all sleeping on the pumpkin pie?
[01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:14.010]  I'm going to eat.
[01:24:14.010 --> 01:24:15.010]  What's next?
[01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:16.010]  Yeah.
[01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:18.010]  And big shout out to Incredibles.
[01:24:18.010 --> 01:24:22.010]  These pieces are perfectly sectioned and labeled into 10 milligram doses.
[01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:25.010]  The recommended dosage for a noob is 10 milligrams.
[01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:27.010]  It's easy to see what 10 milligrams should be.
[01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:29.010]  There should be no dosage concerns for people from out of state.
[01:24:29.010 --> 01:24:30.010]  This is proper.
[01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:31.010]  I like this.
[01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:32.010]  We simplified it for everybody here.
[01:24:32.010 --> 01:24:33.010]  It tastes amazing as well.
[01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:35.010]  It does.
[01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:38.010]  I like this affogato.
[01:24:38.010 --> 01:24:39.010]  Affogato.
[01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:40.010]  Affogato.
[01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:41.010]  Affogato.
[01:24:41.010 --> 01:24:42.010]  Affogato.
[01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:46.010]  You guys, before we go too far, I want to get serious for just a couple of seconds here.
[01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:50.010]  We need to give a shout out to our friends, Justin and Jessica and their family.
[01:24:50.010 --> 01:24:54.010]  They have an 11-year-old son, and he had a major seizure.
[01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:57.010]  He has some technical ... Sorry, you hear those coffee beans crunching in my teeth.
[01:24:57.010 --> 01:24:58.010]  I apologize for that.
[01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:03.010]  Justin and Jessica have an 11-year-old son who currently is having brain surgery.
[01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:07.010]  I want to send a big, just a silent vibration to those guys for half a second.
[01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:09.010]  See, that was for them.
[01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:10.010]  I want their son to heal.
[01:25:10.010 --> 01:25:12.010]  I want him to be better, and I want them to feel comforted.
[01:25:12.010 --> 01:25:14.010]  Just a big shout out to Justin and Jessica.
[01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:16.010]  Hey, I hope you guys get much better.
[01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.010]  I hope everything goes great for you guys.
[01:25:17.010 --> 01:25:21.010]  Much love and support from the Grow From Your Heart podcast and everybody here at the table.
[01:25:23.010 --> 01:25:25.010]  Dang, everybody went silent and somber.
[01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:27.010]  You could feel the love and the concern in the room.
[01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:28.010]  Thank you guys.
[01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:29.010]  That was honest.
[01:25:29.010 --> 01:25:30.010]  I was just hoping for a speedy recovery.
[01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:31.010]  Yes.
[01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:34.010]  I just got a kid out of the hospital, so I'm feeling for you.
[01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:36.010]  Yeah, much love to the whole family there.
[01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:38.010]  Much support from the show and everybody here.
[01:25:38.010 --> 01:25:41.010]  Also, the same person sent me a message.
[01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:43.010]  I asked for memories from the podcast.
[01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:45.010]  I said, Joseph, they're dying.
[01:25:45.010 --> 01:25:47.010]  If you guys need bottles of water or anything, I got them here on the table.
[01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:49.010]  Make yourselves at home, guys.
[01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:54.010]  Jessica sent me a Twitter message, and it said,
[01:25:54.010 --> 01:25:57.010]  You've got to talk about when the dude tried to dab the microphone.
[01:25:59.010 --> 01:26:05.010]  Mike was here one night, and we were recording a show, and I handed him the rig, and I handed him the carb cap.
[01:26:05.010 --> 01:26:07.010]  He held the rig in one hand.
[01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:13.010]  He put the dab onto the nail, and he put his mouth onto the microphone and tried to inhale through the microphone.
[01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:15.010]  Took a big old hit off the microphone.
[01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:17.010]  That is adorable.
[01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:19.010]  It was really funny.
[01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:21.010]  It made me laugh for like a good 10 minutes.
[01:26:21.010 --> 01:26:23.010]  I think we had to press pause because I laughed my ass off.
[01:26:24.010 --> 01:26:26.010]  I'm laughing just thinking about it.
[01:26:26.010 --> 01:26:28.010]  How high was he?
[01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:32.010]  I had the rig, and I dabbed it and capped it, and then just tried to hit the microphone.
[01:26:32.010 --> 01:26:34.010]  Oh, this was you?
[01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:36.010]  Yeah, it was Mike.
[01:26:36.010 --> 01:26:38.010]  He couldn't figure out why the smoke wasn't coming through the rig.
[01:26:38.010 --> 01:26:40.010]  I stared at the microphone for a second, mad.
[01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:42.010]  Like, why isn't this rig working?
[01:26:42.010 --> 01:26:44.010]  It's right in my face. I'm hitting it.
[01:26:44.010 --> 01:26:46.010]  I kind of saw what was happening.
[01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:48.010]  I kind of wasn't sure what I saw happening.
[01:26:48.010 --> 01:26:50.010]  I was pretty sure that that's what was going on.
[01:26:50.010 --> 01:26:52.010]  Maddie just busted off a piece of the pumpkin bar.
[01:26:53.010 --> 01:26:55.010]  It smells so yummy.
[01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:57.010]  Joe just came in for some pumpkin bar.
[01:26:57.010 --> 01:26:59.010]  I'm not a fan of edibles, and this was delicious.
[01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:03.010]  Cheers to everybody that's taken a bite of their pumpkin bar.
[01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:05.010]  Let's see what this thing tastes like.
[01:27:05.010 --> 01:27:07.010]  Let's try to keep track of what I've eaten.
[01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:09.010]  I've had 20 milligrams so far.
[01:27:09.010 --> 01:27:11.010]  This will be 30 and 40.
[01:27:11.010 --> 01:27:13.010]  What are these chips in it?
[01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:15.010]  Graham cracker.
[01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:17.010]  Wow. Pumpkin pie for real.
[01:27:17.010 --> 01:27:19.010]  That is delicious.
[01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:21.010]  That is an amazing edible.
[01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:24.010]  We are so spoiled here.
[01:27:24.010 --> 01:27:26.010]  No more weed flavor in our pop food.
[01:27:26.010 --> 01:27:28.010]  The coffee beans really take away that after bite.
[01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:30.010]  True.
[01:27:30.010 --> 01:27:32.010]  I do get the weedy aftertaste.
[01:27:32.010 --> 01:27:34.010]  It's worth it.
[01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:36.010]  It's earthy and it blends well with the pumpkin flavor.
[01:27:36.010 --> 01:27:38.010]  I kind of like it.
[01:27:38.010 --> 01:27:40.010]  Like Parmesan cheese on spaghetti.
[01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:42.010]  This and a milkshake. Maddie is on to something.
[01:27:42.010 --> 01:27:44.010]  The Incredibles, pumpkin pie delight, pumpkin spice, and graham crackers.
[01:27:44.010 --> 01:27:46.010]  Rasta Jeff approves.
[01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:48.010]  This is 100 milligrams.
[01:27:48.010 --> 01:27:50.010]  If you are not an experienced
[01:27:51.010 --> 01:27:53.010]  edible eater, you will be wrecked.
[01:27:53.010 --> 01:27:55.010]  You will keep eating this thing.
[01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:57.010]  It is delicious.
[01:27:57.010 --> 01:27:59.010]  You can't stop.
[01:27:59.010 --> 01:28:01.010]  Microphone voice.
[01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:03.010]  If you have a sweet tooth, you have no chance of saving this bar.
[01:28:03.010 --> 01:28:05.010]  This is delicious.
[01:28:05.010 --> 01:28:07.010]  I'm going to be silent and eat this thing for the next five minutes.
[01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:09.010]  This is delicious.
[01:28:09.010 --> 01:28:11.010]  We have pumped up this Incredibles company enough.
[01:28:11.010 --> 01:28:13.010]  Unfortunately, the pumpkin spice one is only seasonal.
[01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:15.010]  It's only around $1.
[01:28:15.010 --> 01:28:17.010]  It's not a good deal.
[01:28:17.010 --> 01:28:19.010]  It's not a good deal.
[01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:22.010]  It's only around the holidays.
[01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:24.010]  This will be out in a few days.
[01:28:24.010 --> 01:28:26.010]  When you hear this, go to the spot dispensary in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:28.010]  Grab yourself some Incredibles edibles.
[01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:30.010]  They are delicious.
[01:28:30.010 --> 01:28:32.010]  Tell them Rasta Jeff sent you and you heard about the spot from the
[01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:34.010]  Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:36.010]  Even me?
[01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:38.010]  Everybody.
[01:28:38.010 --> 01:28:40.010]  Go buy edibles there.
[01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:42.010]  I need to take a quick sip.
[01:28:42.010 --> 01:28:44.010]  This thing is drying up my face.
[01:28:44.010 --> 01:28:46.010]  I'm 40 milligrams deep.
[01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:48.010]  Right on.
[01:28:49.010 --> 01:28:51.010]  I'm going to be quiet.
[01:28:51.010 --> 01:28:53.010]  Maddie and I are teaming up on the edibles.
[01:28:53.010 --> 01:28:55.010]  There's more over here.
[01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:57.010]  If you want to crack open more, do not be afraid.
[01:28:57.010 --> 01:28:59.010]  We have two Cannabis Cup winners at the table.
[01:28:59.010 --> 01:29:01.010]  We have not acknowledged that.
[01:29:01.010 --> 01:29:03.010]  Congrats on the show.
[01:29:03.010 --> 01:29:05.010]  You haven't been on the show since you won a cup.
[01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:07.010]  Congratulations.
[01:29:07.010 --> 01:29:09.010]  I don't think you've been here since you won a cup.
[01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:11.010]  I appreciate that a lot.
[01:29:11.010 --> 01:29:13.010]  I remember when they announced it.
[01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:15.010]  They said CBD concentrate goes to.
[01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:18.010]  They said OG to.
[01:29:18.010 --> 01:29:20.010]  Before they finished the name of the strain, I threw my arms up in the
[01:29:20.010 --> 01:29:22.010]  air and looked at my friend that was with me.
[01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:24.010]  That's the Garden of Eden.
[01:29:24.010 --> 01:29:26.010]  I was so stoked for you guys.
[01:29:26.010 --> 01:29:28.010]  I was proud as shit.
[01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:30.010]  When they said it, I didn't even realize it was us.
[01:29:30.010 --> 01:29:32.010]  They said it and I kept saying it over and over.
[01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:34.010]  Spencer was like Maddie, let's go.
[01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:36.010]  My friends all started rushing up on the stage with us.
[01:29:36.010 --> 01:29:38.010]  That was the best part.
[01:29:38.010 --> 01:29:40.010]  Everyone was on stage with us.
[01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:42.010]  It was great to see.
[01:29:42.010 --> 01:29:44.010]  I was in the back taking pictures.
[01:29:45.010 --> 01:29:47.010]  I'm proud of you.
[01:29:47.010 --> 01:29:49.010]  Good job.
[01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:51.010]  There's another cannabis cup coming up in the future.
[01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:53.010]  Do you have anything planned for that?
[01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:55.010]  Which one?
[01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:57.010]  I was thinking about Denver.
[01:29:57.010 --> 01:29:59.010]  Unfortunately, Cali just got canceled.
[01:29:59.010 --> 01:30:01.010]  If we get lucky enough to have a cup of Denver, I'll do it again.
[01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:03.010]  With the way everything is going, I don't think that stuff is going to
[01:30:03.010 --> 01:30:05.010]  last much longer.
[01:30:05.010 --> 01:30:07.010]  That's true.
[01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:09.010]  Unless it's like in Jamaica, that will be fine.
[01:30:09.010 --> 01:30:11.010]  They're not going to touch Jamaica.
[01:30:12.010 --> 01:30:14.010]  It's in a different country.
[01:30:14.010 --> 01:30:16.010]  It's our first time.
[01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:18.010]  They've already approved that.
[01:30:18.010 --> 01:30:20.010]  I was looking on the website today.
[01:30:20.010 --> 01:30:22.010]  Michigan has, is it Michigan?
[01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:24.010]  No, it's California.
[01:30:24.010 --> 01:30:26.010]  The one in LA that they do February of every year.
[01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:28.010]  Is going to have two weekends.
[01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:30.010]  It's going to be one weekend.
[01:30:30.010 --> 01:30:32.010]  I don't know what they're doing the entire week.
[01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:34.010]  Then the next weekend.
[01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:36.010]  That's going to be a lot of work.
[01:30:36.010 --> 01:30:38.010]  I'm not going to touch that.
[01:30:39.010 --> 01:30:41.010]  I don't know what they're doing the entire week.
[01:30:41.010 --> 01:30:43.010]  Then the next weekend.
[01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:45.010]  Things are changing with different states trying to allow.
[01:30:45.010 --> 01:30:48.010]  I think it just comes down to probably how much money you want to put
[01:30:48.010 --> 01:30:50.010]  into it.
[01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:52.010]  They're probably still paying a ridiculous amount to get locations.
[01:30:52.010 --> 01:30:54.010]  Just when at cannabis cups, it's usually people giving away samples.
[01:30:54.010 --> 01:30:56.010]  That's money that the tax people don't see.
[01:30:56.010 --> 01:30:58.010]  It's actually written in the rules.
[01:30:58.010 --> 01:31:00.010]  It's not like they're going to give you money.
[01:31:00.010 --> 01:31:02.010]  It's like, I don't know.
[01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:04.010]  I don't know.
[01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:06.010]  It's actually written in the rules that they can't give out samples.
[01:31:06.010 --> 01:31:08.010]  At events like that.
[01:31:08.010 --> 01:31:10.010]  Is it that nobody can give out samples?
[01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:12.010]  Or only established shops with licenses can't give out samples?
[01:31:12.010 --> 01:31:14.010]  The problem is when the established shops are giving out licenses.
[01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:16.010]  I heard a police officer say.
[01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:18.010]  You said shops giving out licenses.
[01:31:18.010 --> 01:31:20.010]  I did say that.
[01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:22.010]  Licensed shops giving out samples.
[01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:24.010]  Then I want to know what you're talking about.
[01:31:24.010 --> 01:31:26.010]  I'm not going to touch that.
[01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:28.010]  I'm not going to touch that.
[01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:30.010]  I'm not going to touch that.
[01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:32.010]  I'm not going to touch that.
[01:31:32.010 --> 01:31:34.010]  I'm not going to touch that.
[01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:36.010]  I'm not going to touch that.
[01:31:36.010 --> 01:31:38.010]  I heard a cop say today.
[01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:40.010]  That if I give you cannabis.
[01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:42.010]  Even if I gave it to you.
[01:31:42.010 --> 01:31:44.010]  Legally that's a sale.
[01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:46.010]  There was a transaction there that can be considered a sale.
[01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:48.010]  Even if it's a donation.
[01:31:48.010 --> 01:31:50.010]  There's a lot to be careful about.
[01:31:50.010 --> 01:31:52.010]  Technically that's a sale.
[01:31:52.010 --> 01:31:54.010]  I guess that would just be at the cop's discretion.
[01:31:54.010 --> 01:31:56.010]  That's exactly what that cop said.
[01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:58.010]  If they want to be a dick about it.
[01:31:58.010 --> 01:32:00.010]  They can go ahead and arrest you.
[01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:02.010]  I'm going to arrest both of us.
[01:32:02.010 --> 01:32:04.010]  Me for giving it to you and you for accepting it.
[01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:06.010]  Even though we're both over 21.
[01:32:06.010 --> 01:32:08.010]  Go ahead slap. Grab a microphone.
[01:32:08.010 --> 01:32:10.010]  I should just give you guys two mics over there.
[01:32:10.010 --> 01:32:12.010]  There we go.
[01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:14.010]  What about like how does that work though?
[01:32:14.010 --> 01:32:16.010]  Because we can smoke with each other.
[01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:18.010]  That's very true.
[01:32:18.010 --> 01:32:20.010]  I guess as long as neither one of us leaves with anything.
[01:32:20.010 --> 01:32:22.010]  That's a joint right?
[01:32:22.010 --> 01:32:24.010]  Technically the definition of a sale is like.
[01:32:24.010 --> 01:32:26.010]  Mike you're the legal guy here.
[01:32:26.010 --> 01:32:28.010]  Step in Mike.
[01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:30.010]  Well I don't give direct legal advice.
[01:32:30.010 --> 01:32:32.010]  You really just.
[01:32:32.010 --> 01:32:34.010]  We need more pro marijuana laws.
[01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:36.010]  The federal law needs to change.
[01:32:36.010 --> 01:32:38.010]  State laws need to change.
[01:32:38.010 --> 01:32:40.010]  I mean marijuana is legal here.
[01:32:40.010 --> 01:32:42.010]  We have pot stores.
[01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:44.010]  We still can't gather outside of.
[01:32:44.010 --> 01:32:46.010]  Someone's private residence and consume together legally.
[01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:48.010]  All of that's still in a gray market.
[01:32:48.010 --> 01:32:50.010]  People are busted for distribution.
[01:32:50.010 --> 01:32:52.010]  For passing joints or parties.
[01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:54.010]  Or for having more than an ounce on them.
[01:32:54.010 --> 01:32:56.010]  Or for buying a joint.
[01:32:56.010 --> 01:32:58.010]  Or for having more than an ounce on them.
[01:32:58.010 --> 01:33:00.010]  Or for buying weed that comes in multiple bags.
[01:33:00.010 --> 01:33:02.010]  Or for owning a scale so that they can check their purchase after they buy it.
[01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:04.010]  The law needs to change everywhere.
[01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:06.010]  And more people need to get politically active.
[01:33:06.010 --> 01:33:08.010]  Everybody here just got a ballot mailed to them.
[01:33:08.010 --> 01:33:10.010]  Fill that fucker out.
[01:33:10.010 --> 01:33:12.010]  Mail it back in everybody.
[01:33:12.010 --> 01:33:14.010]  Yes.
[01:33:14.010 --> 01:33:16.010]  Register to vote and then vote.
[01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:18.010]  And if your state is working on cannabis regulations.
[01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:20.010]  Make sure you write in.
[01:33:20.010 --> 01:33:22.010]  Public consumption facilities of some sort.
[01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:24.010]  Some place where you can go and gather.
[01:33:24.010 --> 01:33:26.010]  And smoke.
[01:33:26.010 --> 01:33:28.010]  Just like you can go and drink beer at a bar.
[01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:30.010]  You can order shots.
[01:33:30.010 --> 01:33:32.010]  You can order beers.
[01:33:32.010 --> 01:33:34.010]  Let's do something just like that in your bill.
[01:33:34.010 --> 01:33:36.010]  When you go to legalize cannabis in your location.
[01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:38.010]  Let's put something for you to consume.
[01:33:38.010 --> 01:33:40.010]  Everywhere in the US already has the infrastructure.
[01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:42.010]  For adults to go out.
[01:33:42.010 --> 01:33:44.010]  Consume intoxicants and get home safely.
[01:33:44.010 --> 01:33:46.010]  Every place has bars.
[01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:48.010]  Every place.
[01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:50.010]  Everywhere.
[01:33:50.010 --> 01:33:52.010]  All you got to do is call a cab.
[01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:54.010]  You can't get my car.
[01:33:54.010 --> 01:33:56.010]  If they are driving drunks home.
[01:33:56.010 --> 01:33:58.010]  They are going to be happy to drive someone home.
[01:33:58.010 --> 01:34:00.010]  All that shit is already in place.
[01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:02.010]  We just need to utilize it.
[01:34:02.010 --> 01:34:04.010]  All the stone people are going to make more revenue.
[01:34:04.010 --> 01:34:06.010]  You are going to get hungry.
[01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:08.010]  You are going to need a taxi.
[01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:10.010]  You are going to buy gas.
[01:34:10.010 --> 01:34:12.010]  Slop your eyes are as red as that table.
[01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:14.010]  I'm high.
[01:34:14.010 --> 01:34:16.010]  That's a good answer.
[01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:18.010]  I've eaten seven.
[01:34:18.010 --> 01:34:20.010]  Eight pieces of meat.
[01:34:20.010 --> 01:34:22.010]  I've eaten eight pieces of this pumpkin bar.
[01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:24.010]  I'm an edible dude.
[01:34:24.010 --> 01:34:26.010]  Maddie is going for more of the coffee.
[01:34:26.010 --> 01:34:28.010]  That one was tasty.
[01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:30.010]  Joe, grab me a pumpkin piece.
[01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:32.010]  Break it.
[01:34:32.010 --> 01:34:34.010]  These are tasty.
[01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:36.010]  Spence, is your team winning?
[01:34:36.010 --> 01:34:38.010]  I don't know.
[01:34:38.010 --> 01:34:40.010]  My phone is dead.
[01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:42.010]  I can only look at the score of the game.
[01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:44.010]  I don't know how many.
[01:34:44.010 --> 01:34:46.010]  I'm just watching one person.
[01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:48.010]  Spence is deep in a fantasy world.
[01:34:48.010 --> 01:34:50.010]  Spence is deep in a fantasy football thing.
[01:34:50.010 --> 01:34:52.010]  I hear him screaming when I go to the house.
[01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:54.010]  It's so funny.
[01:34:54.010 --> 01:34:56.010]  I don't even know what the fuck is happening.
[01:34:56.010 --> 01:34:58.010]  Come to my house on Sundays.
[01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:00.010]  Especially when the Cowboys lose.
[01:35:00.010 --> 01:35:02.010]  Mike freaks out.
[01:35:02.010 --> 01:35:04.010]  They lost him in overtime a couple of weeks ago.
[01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:06.010]  He literally rampaged.
[01:35:06.010 --> 01:35:08.010]  Wow.
[01:35:08.010 --> 01:35:10.010]  That's when you need to give a man a dab.
[01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:12.010]  Does anybody need a dab?
[01:35:12.010 --> 01:35:14.010]  I can go for one.
[01:35:14.010 --> 01:35:16.010]  Let's give Mike a dab.
[01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:18.010]  I smelled something.
[01:35:18.010 --> 01:35:20.010]  I smelled an aroma from somebody's dab before.
[01:35:20.010 --> 01:35:22.010]  It was pretty...
[01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:24.010]  I think that was a New York City Diesel.
[01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:26.010]  I think I know.
[01:35:26.010 --> 01:35:28.010]  I think it's a New York City Diesel.
[01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:30.010]  Is this live or is it a regular blast?
[01:35:30.010 --> 01:35:32.010]  It's live.
[01:35:32.010 --> 01:35:34.010]  That makes a lot more sense.
[01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:36.010]  Here's a dabber.
[01:35:36.010 --> 01:35:38.010]  Let's give Mike a New York City Diesel dab.
[01:35:38.010 --> 01:35:40.010]  I like all those words.
[01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:42.010]  This shit is super gold.
[01:35:42.010 --> 01:35:44.010]  It's super tasty.
[01:35:44.010 --> 01:35:46.010]  It's super turpidelic.
[01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:48.010]  Take a hit of it and tell me what you think.
[01:35:48.010 --> 01:35:50.010]  You're going to cough for 30 minutes.
[01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:52.010]  I'll tell you what I think of the flavor.
[01:35:52.010 --> 01:35:54.010]  It's super smooth.
[01:35:54.010 --> 01:35:56.010]  It's got like a...
[01:35:56.010 --> 01:35:58.010]  I'll try not to dab the microphone this time.
[01:35:58.010 --> 01:36:00.010]  It would be great if you did.
[01:36:00.010 --> 01:36:02.010]  He got it right this time.
[01:36:02.010 --> 01:36:04.010]  He got it perfectly smooth this time.
[01:36:04.010 --> 01:36:06.010]  Do you guys know if there are any dads
[01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:08.010]  sitting over there at the kids table?
[01:36:08.010 --> 01:36:10.010]  I think that might have been the biggest dab I've ever seen you take.
[01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:12.010]  That was a little bigger.
[01:36:12.010 --> 01:36:14.010]  We've been working him up.
[01:36:14.010 --> 01:36:16.010]  Got my own wrecking torch.
[01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:18.010]  Surely pass down the flavors.
[01:36:18.010 --> 01:36:20.010]  Here, I'll throw you this container of some...
[01:36:20.010 --> 01:36:22.010]  Oh wait, you want this.
[01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:24.010]  Pass that around for Sloppy Joe.
[01:36:24.010 --> 01:36:26.010]  That red wine.
[01:36:26.010 --> 01:36:28.010]  Hey wait, Sloppy Joe over there?
[01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:30.010]  Sloppy Joe at the kids table.
[01:36:30.010 --> 01:36:32.010]  Where else in the world could this happen?
[01:36:32.010 --> 01:36:34.010]  Right there at the kids table.
[01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:36.010]  You guys got a carb cap over there, right?
[01:36:36.010 --> 01:36:38.010]  I got one, but it was there.
[01:36:38.010 --> 01:36:40.010]  You got water in that rig or what?
[01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:42.010]  Yeah, I apologize.
[01:36:42.010 --> 01:36:44.010]  I have a Toro rig. Shout out to my friend Nikki.
[01:36:44.010 --> 01:36:46.010]  She sold me a Toro rig.
[01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:48.010]  It's a go pass little rig, but unfortunately
[01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:50.010]  I left the e-nail on and all of the water
[01:36:50.010 --> 01:36:52.010]  evaporated and Slop tried to take a dab.
[01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:54.010]  I succeeded in taking a dab.
[01:36:54.010 --> 01:36:56.010]  Yeah, Mike took a dab off of it.
[01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:58.010]  I took one. It was just unfortunate.
[01:36:58.010 --> 01:37:00.010]  Dry.
[01:37:00.010 --> 01:37:02.010]  It explains why your eyes are as red as that.
[01:37:02.010 --> 01:37:04.010]  And this candy bar that
[01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:06.010]  tastes like it came from somebody's grandma.
[01:37:06.010 --> 01:37:08.010]  Dude, they're getting redder.
[01:37:08.010 --> 01:37:10.010]  Is that a good thing or a bad thing when a candy bar
[01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:12.010]  tastes like it came from somebody's grandma?
[01:37:12.010 --> 01:37:14.010]  That is a great thing.
[01:37:14.010 --> 01:37:16.010]  It is so turpid-delic. I'm throwing piece
[01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:18.010]  number nine of this one in my mouth.
[01:37:18.010 --> 01:37:20.010]  Oh yeah.
[01:37:20.010 --> 01:37:22.010]  I'm going to be wrecked here in about 30 or 40 minutes.
[01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:24.010]  This is going to be a really fun podcast.
[01:37:24.010 --> 01:37:26.010]  We've got to record for a long time and see what all this stuff does to me.
[01:37:26.010 --> 01:37:28.010]  See how high we get? I haven't eaten today.
[01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:30.010]  Wow, I haven't
[01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:32.010]  eaten today. Wow, you're going to be really high.
[01:37:32.010 --> 01:37:34.010]  Yeah, I was planning to get some Chipotle after this.
[01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:36.010]  Oh, why did you say Chipotle? That was evil.
[01:37:36.010 --> 01:37:38.010]  We can go together. Let's just hit pause.
[01:37:38.010 --> 01:37:40.010]  Break. We'll be back.
[01:37:40.010 --> 01:37:42.010]  We'll be right back. Anybody want anything?
[01:37:42.010 --> 01:37:44.010]  And we're back from Chipotle.
[01:37:44.010 --> 01:37:46.010]  Not really. I wish we could all go to Chipotle that quickly.
[01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:48.010]  You know they have a fax machine order?
[01:37:48.010 --> 01:37:50.010]  Oh, really?
[01:37:50.010 --> 01:37:52.010]  Man.
[01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:54.010]  Man. Somebody deliver some Chipotle, you guys.
[01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:56.010]  Dispensaries
[01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:58.010]  have that Express app too.
[01:37:58.010 --> 01:38:00.010]  Have you seen that? Wow, that's pretty cool.
[01:38:00.010 --> 01:38:02.010]  You can order online ahead. That's pretty spiffy.
[01:38:02.010 --> 01:38:04.010]  Wow, you just go and type in on your phone
[01:38:04.010 --> 01:38:06.010]  like I need two grams of hash
[01:38:06.010 --> 01:38:08.010]  and a quarter of good nugs and four Incredibles
[01:38:08.010 --> 01:38:10.010]  and I'll be there. Have it in a bag with your name on it.
[01:38:10.010 --> 01:38:12.010]  Stapled with your name on it.
[01:38:12.010 --> 01:38:14.010]  You show up and they take your cash and you leave.
[01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:16.010]  That's the future.
[01:38:16.010 --> 01:38:18.010]  The ball's here.
[01:38:18.010 --> 01:38:20.010]  I wish we could do deliveries in Colorado. Unfortunately,
[01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:22.010]  delivery of cannabis has been
[01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:24.010]  banned. That's a no-no here.
[01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:26.010]  They kill it in every other state.
[01:38:26.010 --> 01:38:28.010]  Yeah. On the winter, man,
[01:38:28.010 --> 01:38:30.010]  when you don't want to drive to the dispensary,
[01:38:30.010 --> 01:38:32.010]  you just get an eighth delivery and there's so much snow
[01:38:32.010 --> 01:38:34.010]  outside.
[01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:36.010]  It is drove around at a wholesale level,
[01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:38.010]  right? That's regulated in some way.
[01:38:38.010 --> 01:38:40.010]  Do they go around in an armored
[01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:42.010]  truck? I know you guys
[01:38:42.010 --> 01:38:44.010]  all have tremendous experience in this.
[01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:46.010]  I'm an outsider just asking the questions.
[01:38:46.010 --> 01:38:48.010]  Just manifested from a place to a place.
[01:38:48.010 --> 01:38:50.010]  CBDRX
[01:38:50.010 --> 01:38:52.010]  has trucks that are labeled CBDRX,
[01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:54.010]  which is a CBD company.
[01:38:54.010 --> 01:38:56.010]  They specialize in mostly CBD medicine.
[01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:58.010]  Yeah, go for it, Slappy.
[01:38:58.010 --> 01:39:00.010]  You don't have to ask for permission to use the men's room.
[01:39:00.010 --> 01:39:02.010]  You're headed to it. Take a left as soon as you can.
[01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:04.010]  There you go. It's really pink.
[01:39:04.010 --> 01:39:06.010]  The restroom is really pink.
[01:39:06.010 --> 01:39:08.010]  CBDRX cruises around with their label
[01:39:08.010 --> 01:39:10.010]  on their truck and then they have a trailer
[01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:12.010]  with just covered shit on it. You can tell it's just
[01:39:12.010 --> 01:39:14.010]  product for days on the trailer.
[01:39:14.010 --> 01:39:16.010]  A lot of times, you have to fill out a manifest
[01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:18.010]  before you leave.
[01:39:18.010 --> 01:39:20.010]  Before the product leaves one building,
[01:39:20.010 --> 01:39:22.010]  you have to fill out a manifest of the
[01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:24.010]  amount of product,
[01:39:24.010 --> 01:39:26.010]  the car license plate, the driver,
[01:39:26.010 --> 01:39:28.010]  and even the route you're going.
[01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:30.010]  Yeah, the route that you're going to take has to be documented.
[01:39:30.010 --> 01:39:32.010]  Because you can't be like off,
[01:39:32.010 --> 01:39:34.010]  like if you get caught like 30
[01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:36.010]  minutes off of your path you're supposed to go
[01:39:36.010 --> 01:39:38.010]  to, they could like say
[01:39:38.010 --> 01:39:40.010]  you're doing, you know what I'm saying?
[01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:42.010]  Yeah, so you can't stop at McDonald's or
[01:39:42.010 --> 01:39:44.010]  nothing on the way even if it's like a four-hour drive.
[01:39:44.010 --> 01:39:46.010]  Everything here is hyper-regulated, guys.
[01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:48.010]  Yeah, and then you have to fax that to
[01:39:48.010 --> 01:39:50.010]  the MED like 24
[01:39:50.010 --> 01:39:52.010]  hours before you leave and they have to approve it.
[01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:54.010]  And then when you get the product there, you have
[01:39:54.010 --> 01:39:56.010]  to basically do the opposite of everything.
[01:39:56.010 --> 01:39:58.010]  It has to be signed by the other people.
[01:39:58.010 --> 01:40:00.010]  Yeah, and then weighed,
[01:40:00.010 --> 01:40:02.010]  and then faxed that it was received.
[01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:04.010]  Yeah, so they really track
[01:40:04.010 --> 01:40:06.010]  all of the product here in Colorado. They pay
[01:40:06.010 --> 01:40:08.010]  a lot of attention. They call it the seed to sale model.
[01:40:08.010 --> 01:40:10.010]  From the minute that we germinate
[01:40:10.010 --> 01:40:12.010]  a seed in the shop, it's under camera
[01:40:12.010 --> 01:40:14.010]  and it has a MIPS number and an RFID.
[01:40:14.010 --> 01:40:16.010]  And it'll be that
[01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:18.010]  RFID until harvest time.
[01:40:18.010 --> 01:40:20.010]  And when it gets tested, because everything has
[01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:22.010]  to be tested, when it does get a test, it'll be
[01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:24.010]  tested under that RFID number.
[01:40:24.010 --> 01:40:26.010]  There was just another bunch of recalls
[01:40:26.010 --> 01:40:28.010]  today.
[01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:30.010]  Yeah, saw that shit ton of recalls.
[01:40:30.010 --> 01:40:32.010]  Another hundred thousand plants recalled.
[01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:34.010]  Wow. For what dispensary?
[01:40:34.010 --> 01:40:36.010]  I had two of them up in Denver.
[01:40:36.010 --> 01:40:38.010]  Two dispensaries in Denver
[01:40:38.010 --> 01:40:40.010]  gave product that had
[01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:42.010]  whether or not it be PM, pesticides,
[01:40:42.010 --> 01:40:44.010]  whatever, to another...
[01:40:44.010 --> 01:40:46.010]  to a bunch
[01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:48.010]  of extract companies. And it was literally
[01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:50.010]  probably almost every
[01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:52.010]  extract company, like bigger
[01:40:52.010 --> 01:40:54.010]  extract company in Denver. And they had
[01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.010]  to return...
[01:40:56.010 --> 01:40:58.010]  I only had time to scan that one before today's
[01:40:58.010 --> 01:41:00.010]  meeting. But yeah, the list of stuff that's
[01:41:00.010 --> 01:41:02.010]  getting recalled is big.
[01:41:02.010 --> 01:41:04.010]  So how does a cannabis recall
[01:41:04.010 --> 01:41:06.010]  work? Do the customers that
[01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:08.010]  purchase it, do they bring back their product?
[01:41:08.010 --> 01:41:10.010]  No, everything that has...
[01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:12.010]  If you buy it, it has...
[01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:14.010]  All the products have a batch number on it.
[01:41:14.010 --> 01:41:16.010]  So they can identify which
[01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:18.010]  batch it is. So if you look on
[01:41:18.010 --> 01:41:20.010]  your jar and it has
[01:41:20.010 --> 01:41:22.010]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[01:41:22.010 --> 01:41:24.010]  and hopefully you ain't smoked it all already.
[01:41:24.010 --> 01:41:26.010]  Right. Well, that's... There's also
[01:41:26.010 --> 01:41:28.010]  two lawsuits for people who
[01:41:28.010 --> 01:41:30.010]  ingested... Yeah, that could be a lot of
[01:41:30.010 --> 01:41:32.010]  lawsuits coming around. Yeah.
[01:41:32.010 --> 01:41:34.010]  But it's going to be years before these people find out
[01:41:34.010 --> 01:41:36.010]  if they got sick from any of the things that they smoked.
[01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:38.010]  And then how can you say that it was this batch
[01:41:38.010 --> 01:41:40.010]  of hash right here that got you sick after we've
[01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:42.010]  done a million dabs in the past five years?
[01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:44.010]  We're the hash test dummies.
[01:41:44.010 --> 01:41:46.010]  We are. That's honestly your... You were kind
[01:41:46.010 --> 01:41:48.010]  of kidding, but we are the hash test dummies. Any
[01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:50.010]  bad things that are coming from this cannabis
[01:41:50.010 --> 01:41:52.010]  use the way that we're doing it?
[01:41:52.010 --> 01:41:54.010]  They're going to discover them with us. Yeah, it'll be our
[01:41:54.010 --> 01:41:56.010]  generation and this movement that does discover it.
[01:41:56.010 --> 01:41:58.010]  I have to say either way, I was extremely
[01:41:58.010 --> 01:42:00.010]  happy, so that's all that really matters,
[01:42:00.010 --> 01:42:02.010]  right? I just put
[01:42:02.010 --> 01:42:04.010]  down the rest of that pumpkin
[01:42:04.010 --> 01:42:06.010]  pie delight bar and it was
[01:42:06.010 --> 01:42:08.010]  actually super delightful. I am delighted.
[01:42:08.010 --> 01:42:10.010]  There's one piece left. I think somebody should...
[01:42:10.010 --> 01:42:12.010]  Anybody can have that. If we need to crack open more, there's
[01:42:12.010 --> 01:42:14.010]  a strawberry crunch that I've never tried and I know
[01:42:14.010 --> 01:42:16.010]  the monkey bar is delicious. I only want
[01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:18.010]  to eat it because it tastes good.
[01:42:18.010 --> 01:42:20.010]  What other reasons
[01:42:20.010 --> 01:42:22.010]  do you eat things?
[01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:24.010]  Specifically the medicated bars to
[01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:26.010]  medicate. To get me high as shit.
[01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:30.010]  I don't need to get any more high, but man,
[01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:32.010]  that thing's tasty. How many milligrams
[01:42:32.010 --> 01:42:34.010]  have you had so far? I'm 50 in right
[01:42:34.010 --> 01:42:36.010]  now. Oh, you're going to feel it if you're not an edible
[01:42:36.010 --> 01:42:38.010]  eater. Oh man, I usually
[01:42:38.010 --> 01:42:40.010]  save this much for a plane ride. Say that to the mic.
[01:42:40.010 --> 01:42:42.010]  I got some capsules in the car.
[01:42:42.010 --> 01:42:44.010]  300 milligram
[01:42:44.010 --> 01:42:46.010]  capsules. Oh shit. If you want to have fun.
[01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:48.010]  If we want to have fun.
[01:42:48.010 --> 01:42:50.010]  I'm not eating them. Maddie just
[01:42:50.010 --> 01:42:52.010]  leaned her eyeball into the microphone. Those get me
[01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:54.010]  drunk feeling.
[01:42:54.010 --> 01:42:56.010]  Like where I can barely move my
[01:42:56.010 --> 01:42:58.010]  arms and where I sleep for like a
[01:42:58.010 --> 01:43:00.010]  solid 12 hours when I actually do fall
[01:43:00.010 --> 01:43:02.010]  asleep. No, I can't be doing that.
[01:43:02.010 --> 01:43:04.010]  I don't know. I'd beat up in 12 hours
[01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:06.010]  from now. You're going to be somewhere
[01:43:06.010 --> 01:43:08.010]  12 hours from now. The first
[01:43:08.010 --> 01:43:10.010]  time I ate 100 milligram
[01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:12.010]  bar. I had to like go lay
[01:43:12.010 --> 01:43:14.010]  on the bed and gather
[01:43:14.010 --> 01:43:16.010]  myself. I was like, oh my God.
[01:43:16.010 --> 01:43:18.010]  Speaking of going to lay down,
[01:43:18.010 --> 01:43:20.010]  let's give a big shout out to our buddy Jesse. He's not
[01:43:20.010 --> 01:43:22.010]  here recording with us tonight because he had shit to handle,
[01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:24.010]  which is not a problem, but let's give him a shout out for
[01:43:24.010 --> 01:43:26.010]  the time that he did have to go lay down on the show
[01:43:26.010 --> 01:43:28.010]  because he took a fat dab and turned green.
[01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:30.010]  Lay down on the couch
[01:43:30.010 --> 01:43:32.010]  over there and take a break.
[01:43:32.010 --> 01:43:34.010]  Big shout out to Jesse.
[01:43:34.010 --> 01:43:36.010]  That was great. I felt like I killed the man.
[01:43:36.010 --> 01:43:38.010]  I felt kind of bad, but I was laughing at the same time.
[01:43:38.010 --> 01:43:40.010]  He lived through it. He's alright now.
[01:43:40.010 --> 01:43:42.010]  We can make fun of him on the show. Matt, he's about
[01:43:42.010 --> 01:43:44.010]  to take a hit out of the Elevate
[01:43:44.010 --> 01:43:46.010]  Knockoff, the fake mothership.
[01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:48.010]  The Clinda.
[01:43:48.010 --> 01:43:50.010]  See, my name's stuck on. I'm glad I called
[01:43:50.010 --> 01:43:52.010]  it the Clinda.
[01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:54.010]  After that, we might switch that
[01:43:54.010 --> 01:43:56.010]  email over here to the little hitman because it
[01:43:56.010 --> 01:43:58.010]  hits a little better in my opinion. It gives you a little meaner
[01:43:58.010 --> 01:44:00.010]  rip.
[01:44:00.010 --> 01:44:02.010]  That's pretty nice for it.
[01:44:02.010 --> 01:44:04.010]  Right, for a mothership knockoff?
[01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:06.010]  I feel like I did alright. Guys, make sure you
[01:44:06.010 --> 01:44:08.010]  check out Elevate Glass in Colorado Springs.
[01:44:08.010 --> 01:44:10.010]  They do not sponsor the show, but they have good glass at reasonable
[01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:12.010]  prices.
[01:44:12.010 --> 01:44:14.010]  In one
[01:44:14.010 --> 01:44:16.010]  go, you're like,
[01:44:16.010 --> 01:44:18.010]  you mean that knockoff? Yeah, everybody
[01:44:18.010 --> 01:44:20.010]  go check out Elevate Glass.
[01:44:20.010 --> 01:44:22.010]  It's not a mothership, so it wasn't
[01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:24.010]  $2,500 and it hits just like a
[01:44:24.010 --> 01:44:26.010]  mothership, so it was worth the $250
[01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:28.010]  or $200 or whatever it was worth.
[01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:30.010]  It is a knockoff, but I mean
[01:44:30.010 --> 01:44:32.010]  it works
[01:44:32.010 --> 01:44:34.010]  the same. It's glass. If you don't know
[01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:36.010]  any better, you don't know any better. That's a great rig.
[01:44:36.010 --> 01:44:38.010]  If you don't know them
[01:44:38.010 --> 01:44:40.010]  jeans is Gucci, you didn't know.
[01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:42.010]  Alright, I'm going to take a dab here. I feel
[01:44:42.010 --> 01:44:44.010]  those edibles starting to creep up in the back of my brain
[01:44:44.010 --> 01:44:46.010]  and I like what's happening.
[01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:48.010]  I already started feeling them. I might be high school
[01:44:48.010 --> 01:44:50.010]  high. Sloppy, your eyes look like
[01:44:50.010 --> 01:44:52.010]  high school high.
[01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:54.010]  I would have no way of directly
[01:44:54.010 --> 01:44:56.010]  telling apart the edible high versus the
[01:44:56.010 --> 01:44:58.010]  dab high. I like it.
[01:44:58.010 --> 01:45:00.010]  Really, I feel like when I'm on an edible high,
[01:45:00.010 --> 01:45:02.010]  my body feels like slouchy.
[01:45:02.010 --> 01:45:04.010]  Yeah,
[01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:06.010]  my body just feels like...
[01:45:06.010 --> 01:45:08.010]  Y'all filled up with sand or something over there?
[01:45:08.010 --> 01:45:10.010]  You know them weights
[01:45:10.010 --> 01:45:12.010]  they put on Samurai Jack?
[01:45:12.010 --> 01:45:14.010]  You know them weights they put on Samurai Jack?
[01:45:14.010 --> 01:45:16.010]  That's where I'm at. I'm getting my training on.
[01:45:16.010 --> 01:45:18.010]  Do we need to get you a seatbelt for your chair, bro?
[01:45:18.010 --> 01:45:20.010]  Maybe. I might need to
[01:45:20.010 --> 01:45:22.010]  get a cab.
[01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:24.010]  I'll get everybody home
[01:45:24.010 --> 01:45:26.010]  safely. Don't worry. Safely?
[01:45:26.010 --> 01:45:28.010]  So we saw somebody get
[01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:30.010]  a DUI on Periscope the
[01:45:30.010 --> 01:45:32.010]  next day. You guys, that is ridiculous.
[01:45:32.010 --> 01:45:34.010]  If you were drunk, don't drive.
[01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:36.010]  And if you were retardedly drunk, don't drink
[01:45:36.010 --> 01:45:38.010]  and drive and Periscope at the same fucking time.
[01:45:38.010 --> 01:45:40.010]  These people saw this girl Periscoping
[01:45:40.010 --> 01:45:42.010]  and driving drunk as hell and they called
[01:45:42.010 --> 01:45:44.010]  the cops on her and the cops pulled her over
[01:45:44.010 --> 01:45:46.010]  on Periscope. You get to see the red and blues
[01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:48.010]  pop up and she goes,
[01:45:48.010 --> 01:45:50.010]  I have to get home and that's the way the video
[01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:52.010]  ends. I felt so bad for that
[01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:54.010]  young girl but it was kind of funny and kind of sad
[01:45:54.010 --> 01:45:56.010]  at the same time. Don't drink and drive, you guys. Don't do that.
[01:45:56.010 --> 01:45:58.010]  People have to learn their lesson somehow
[01:45:58.010 --> 01:46:00.010]  I'm happy that she didn't learn her lesson by hurting
[01:46:00.010 --> 01:46:02.010]  somebody else. That's the truth, right? Or herself.
[01:46:02.010 --> 01:46:04.010]  So at least that officer pulled her over.
[01:46:04.010 --> 01:46:06.010]  That's true. Shout out to the
[01:46:06.010 --> 01:46:08.010]  Periscope people. Periscope
[01:46:08.010 --> 01:46:10.010]  police out there, hun. Periscope police.
[01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:12.010]  I got a lot of people that follow me on Periscope.
[01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:14.010]  I'd like to give them all a shout out but I'm sure that I'll skip
[01:46:14.010 --> 01:46:16.010]  one so I'm not even going to try. Shout out to everybody.
[01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:18.010]  You know who you are. What's up, guys? Thanks for joining me.
[01:46:18.010 --> 01:46:20.010]  Are there any papers? I would
[01:46:20.010 --> 01:46:22.010]  roll a blunt but I know you're not part of the dark side.
[01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:24.010]  In that cabinet right in front of you, there's a grinder
[01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:26.010]  with papers attached to it.
[01:46:26.010 --> 01:46:28.010]  Shout out to the... Oh, Buzzy's got a
[01:46:28.010 --> 01:46:30.010]  cannon rolled already of some
[01:46:30.010 --> 01:46:32.010]  Gorilla Glue No. 4.
[01:46:32.010 --> 01:46:34.010]  Yes. Sloppy's got some
[01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:36.010]  some Nigerian
[01:46:36.010 --> 01:46:38.010]  other stuff mixed in.
[01:46:38.010 --> 01:46:40.010]  Some other stuff mixed in.
[01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:42.010]  Sloppy just pulled out some Nigerian
[01:46:42.010 --> 01:46:44.010]  Nightmare... What do you guys call that
[01:46:44.010 --> 01:46:46.010]  when you roll it around like that?
[01:46:46.010 --> 01:46:48.010]  Some Moon Rocks or Caviar.
[01:46:48.010 --> 01:46:50.010]  Here, grab the mic, bro. We're going to ask you some questions.
[01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:52.010]  Moon Rocks or Caviar.
[01:46:52.010 --> 01:46:54.010]  Moon Rocks or Caviar. It's a Nigerian
[01:46:54.010 --> 01:46:56.010]  Nightmare is the bud, right? Yes.
[01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:58.010]  And then what happened to it?
[01:46:58.010 --> 01:47:00.010]  And then I took
[01:47:00.010 --> 01:47:02.010]  a bunch of oil and put it on a
[01:47:02.010 --> 01:47:04.010]  hot plate to get it
[01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:06.010]  melted down and liquidy.
[01:47:06.010 --> 01:47:08.010]  And then I rolled the nug around
[01:47:08.010 --> 01:47:10.010]  in it and dropped it in
[01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:12.010]  a mason jar full of keef
[01:47:12.010 --> 01:47:14.010]  that I got from a pollen box
[01:47:14.010 --> 01:47:16.010]  and I shook the shit
[01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:18.010]  out of it. And then now it looks
[01:47:18.010 --> 01:47:20.010]  crazy. It looks really crazy. It's hard
[01:47:20.010 --> 01:47:22.010]  and crunchy. I checked it out a little bit earlier. Thank you,
[01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:24.010]  So you guys call that Caviar
[01:47:24.010 --> 01:47:26.010]  or Moon Rocks? There's a lighter in that
[01:47:26.010 --> 01:47:28.010]  same... I don't know, in front of you? Same thing.
[01:47:28.010 --> 01:47:30.010]  No. I was
[01:47:30.010 --> 01:47:32.010]  like, yes, right here. Right there. Pow!
[01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:34.010]  The stoner Caviar. There's all kinds of good
[01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:36.010]  shit in there. There's a grind of their papers in there.
[01:47:36.010 --> 01:47:38.010]  There's probably an elf that knows how to roll a joint hidden in there
[01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:40.010]  somewhere. Sweet. Yes, it's not for
[01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:42.010]  sale. I'm keeping
[01:47:42.010 --> 01:47:44.010]  the joint rolling elf. I will die with that.
[01:47:44.010 --> 01:47:46.010]  That's one of my prized possessions.
[01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:48.010]  Alright, what the fuck are we even talking about?
[01:47:48.010 --> 01:47:50.010]  It's episode number 100, you guys. Holy crap.
[01:47:50.010 --> 01:47:52.010]  We got Spence and Maddie back from the Garden of
[01:47:52.010 --> 01:47:54.010]  Weed and they haven't been here in a
[01:47:54.010 --> 01:47:56.010]  long freaking time. Did you guys bring
[01:47:56.010 --> 01:47:58.010]  the cannabis cup? No.
[01:47:58.010 --> 01:48:00.010]  It's not a cup. No, it's a plaque.
[01:48:00.010 --> 01:48:02.010]  It's a plaque, you guys. They gave them a square plaque.
[01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:04.010]  It looks like a bowling trophy now. It's a plaque
[01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:06.010]  with a picture of a trophy.
[01:48:06.010 --> 01:48:08.010]  So it's there in spirit.
[01:48:08.010 --> 01:48:10.010]  They probably got tired of
[01:48:10.010 --> 01:48:12.010]  making a bunch of cups.
[01:48:12.010 --> 01:48:14.010]  You know, when they commented on it,
[01:48:14.010 --> 01:48:16.010]  they said that we didn't enter
[01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:18.010]  a... What was it? CBD isn't
[01:48:18.010 --> 01:48:20.010]  considered a...
[01:48:20.010 --> 01:48:22.010]  Oh, it's a High Times
[01:48:22.010 --> 01:48:24.010]  award, not a Cannabis Cup
[01:48:24.010 --> 01:48:26.010]  award.
[01:48:26.010 --> 01:48:28.010]  So you take the actual medicine
[01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:30.010]  and you separate it from all the other
[01:48:30.010 --> 01:48:32.010]  things.
[01:48:32.010 --> 01:48:34.010]  Isn't it kind of sad?
[01:48:34.010 --> 01:48:36.010]  Yeah.
[01:48:36.010 --> 01:48:38.010]  That's kind of weird.
[01:48:38.010 --> 01:48:40.010]  I don't want a guy quiet like we're
[01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:42.010]  kicking puppies or something.
[01:48:42.010 --> 01:48:44.010]  I don't want to go dissing High Times
[01:48:44.010 --> 01:48:46.010]  because they do a lot of great things, but sometimes
[01:48:46.010 --> 01:48:48.010]  it feels like they're doing some sketchy shit sometimes
[01:48:48.010 --> 01:48:50.010]  a little bit. There's just a lot of
[01:48:50.010 --> 01:48:52.010]  stuff behind the scenes that we don't know about.
[01:48:52.010 --> 01:48:54.010]  Shout out to Danny Danko for listening to the podcast.
[01:48:54.010 --> 01:48:56.010]  Word.
[01:48:56.010 --> 01:48:58.010]  Yeah. Alright. So you guys
[01:48:58.010 --> 01:49:00.010]  got... I'm going to say you guys are cup winners. You guys have a
[01:49:00.010 --> 01:49:02.010]  Cannabis Cup. Fuck the rules.
[01:49:02.010 --> 01:49:04.010]  You guys won a Cannabis Cup in my mind. That's a cup.
[01:49:04.010 --> 01:49:06.010]  Yeah. Cannabis plaque.
[01:49:06.010 --> 01:49:08.010]  I'm the first black dude to win a Cannabis Cup.
[01:49:08.010 --> 01:49:10.010]  Are you? Pretty damn close.
[01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:12.010]  So what would the first
[01:49:12.010 --> 01:49:14.010]  black guy to win a Cannabis Cup... What would you
[01:49:14.010 --> 01:49:16.010]  drink out of the Cannabis Cup if they had given you a cup?
[01:49:16.010 --> 01:49:18.010]  Probably like a 40.
[01:49:18.010 --> 01:49:20.010]  A 40? Just pour a 40? OE 800?
[01:49:20.010 --> 01:49:22.010]  Yeah.
[01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:24.010]  That's my boy right there.
[01:49:24.010 --> 01:49:26.010]  Spencer's definitely the first black guy to win the
[01:49:26.010 --> 01:49:28.010]  secret cup though. Oh yeah for sure.
[01:49:28.010 --> 01:49:30.010]  I was there for that one too.
[01:49:30.010 --> 01:49:32.010]  That was pretty awesome. Maddie, if you would have brought
[01:49:32.010 --> 01:49:34.010]  home a Cannabis Cup, what would have been the first thing you would have drank
[01:49:34.010 --> 01:49:36.010]  out of a Cannabis Cup?
[01:49:38.010 --> 01:49:40.010]  You can say it. Don't look all shy.
[01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:42.010]  I don't know. I probably
[01:49:42.010 --> 01:49:44.010]  would have put a stupid margarita or something in there.
[01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:46.010]  That sounds good. Or maybe a smoothie.
[01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:48.010]  Your homie's pouring a fucking
[01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:50.010]  40 in there. You can put a margarita or a smoothie in there.
[01:49:50.010 --> 01:49:52.010]  We already know what Mike would drink
[01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:54.010]  out of a Cannabis Cup. Mike would drink a Mountain Dew
[01:49:54.010 --> 01:49:56.010]  out of that sucker right away.
[01:49:56.010 --> 01:49:58.010]  Mountain Dew.
[01:49:58.010 --> 01:50:00.010]  Fill it up with that Dew.
[01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:02.010]  What would you drink out of your Cannabis Cup, bro?
[01:50:02.010 --> 01:50:04.010]  Whatever you want, bro. It's your own
[01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:06.010]  Cannabis Cup. You gotta clean it.
[01:50:06.010 --> 01:50:08.010]  Liquid acid would be appropriate.
[01:50:08.010 --> 01:50:10.010]  He's going
[01:50:10.010 --> 01:50:12.010]  hard on this motherfucker. You guys, I do
[01:50:12.010 --> 01:50:14.010]  not condone or recommend you drinking a
[01:50:14.010 --> 01:50:16.010]  Cannabis Cup filled with liquid acid.
[01:50:16.010 --> 01:50:18.010]  That sounds like a horrible time. The 40
[01:50:18.010 --> 01:50:20.010]  would do you just nice. Yeah, yeah. Maybe put
[01:50:20.010 --> 01:50:22.010]  your finger in the acid and then fill it up with
[01:50:22.010 --> 01:50:24.010]  some grape juice or something. Sprite
[01:50:24.010 --> 01:50:26.010]  with a couple drops of liquid acid.
[01:50:26.010 --> 01:50:28.010]  That sounds a little bit better.
[01:50:28.010 --> 01:50:30.010]  Alright, pass the mic over there to our homie
[01:50:30.010 --> 01:50:32.010]  Buzzy. Mr. Buzzy, if you want
[01:50:32.010 --> 01:50:34.010]  a Cannabis Cup right now and you can fill it up with anything
[01:50:34.010 --> 01:50:36.010]  and take a drink.
[01:50:36.010 --> 01:50:38.010]  I have an answer, but it only makes
[01:50:38.010 --> 01:50:40.010]  sense to a few people. It would have to be
[01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:42.010]  a Kale Shake.
[01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:44.010]  I thought it was
[01:50:44.010 --> 01:50:46.010]  either Kale Shake or like Starbucks drink for
[01:50:46.010 --> 01:50:48.010]  me. Oh man, yo, a giant
[01:50:48.010 --> 01:50:50.010]  frozen like mocha
[01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:52.010]  drink? That would be amazing. A frosted
[01:50:52.010 --> 01:50:54.010]  cup? A mocha frappuccino and that
[01:50:54.010 --> 01:50:56.010]  would be amazing. A mocha frappuccino and a Cannabis Cup.
[01:50:56.010 --> 01:50:58.010]  A mocha frappuccino filled with that? I got no
[01:50:58.010 --> 01:51:00.010]  complaints. That's why we all don't have Cannabis
[01:51:00.010 --> 01:51:02.010]  Cups because they know we'll just be filling them up with lean
[01:51:02.010 --> 01:51:04.010]  and drinking out of them.
[01:51:04.010 --> 01:51:06.010]  They were like, where's she gonna get this
[01:51:06.010 --> 01:51:08.010]  plaque? He doesn't need a cup.
[01:51:08.010 --> 01:51:10.010]  Right, right. No one's gonna steal
[01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:12.010]  his plaque.
[01:51:12.010 --> 01:51:14.010]  I wish
[01:51:14.010 --> 01:51:16.010]  you would have had your grill when you won the Cannabis Cup.
[01:51:16.010 --> 01:51:18.010]  Sorry I mentioned the grill.
[01:51:18.010 --> 01:51:20.010]  Hey, if anybody finds Spencer's grill.
[01:51:20.010 --> 01:51:22.010]  Yeah, everybody knows where it's at.
[01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:24.010]  I need that.
[01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:26.010]  You can send it to my PO Box. We'll get you the address.
[01:51:26.010 --> 01:51:28.010]  That'd be awesome. I appreciate it.
[01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:30.010]  I'm gonna hit this joint at Gorilla Glue because it smells delicious.
[01:51:30.010 --> 01:51:32.010]  It's tasty too.
[01:51:32.010 --> 01:51:34.010]  This is great. 100th episode.
[01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:36.010]  You're smoking flowers.
[01:51:36.010 --> 01:51:38.010]  I've had this dab in my head for like 10 minutes.
[01:51:38.010 --> 01:51:40.010]  Join my friend.
[01:51:40.010 --> 01:51:42.010]  Pro dabbing. I was just reading an article.
[01:51:42.010 --> 01:51:44.010]  I'm sure you guys have all heard that
[01:51:44.010 --> 01:51:46.010]  they're releasing like 6,000
[01:51:46.010 --> 01:51:48.010]  non-violent... Get on the mic just a little tiny. Yeah, there you go.
[01:51:48.010 --> 01:51:50.010]  Oh, did you hear me?
[01:51:50.010 --> 01:51:52.010]  Non-violent criminals
[01:51:52.010 --> 01:51:54.010]  from prisons due to overcrowding.
[01:51:54.010 --> 01:51:56.010]  Nice. I think that's
[01:51:56.010 --> 01:51:58.010]  awesome. So they should just let out all the
[01:51:58.010 --> 01:52:00.010]  weed people first.
[01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:02.010]  I was gonna say, what's non-violent?
[01:52:02.010 --> 01:52:04.010]  Some of them weren't even convicted
[01:52:04.010 --> 01:52:06.010]  but they've been in there for years.
[01:52:06.010 --> 01:52:08.010]  Yeah, just waiting.
[01:52:08.010 --> 01:52:10.010]  Another positive step.
[01:52:10.010 --> 01:52:12.010]  Yep. One step
[01:52:12.010 --> 01:52:14.010]  closer. Yeah, I knew this
[01:52:14.010 --> 01:52:16.010]  dude that was a Marine
[01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:18.010]  and he came back and
[01:52:18.010 --> 01:52:20.010]  he got assaulted and
[01:52:20.010 --> 01:52:22.010]  like put the dude in a coma
[01:52:22.010 --> 01:52:24.010]  and they put him in jail and he was in
[01:52:24.010 --> 01:52:26.010]  county jail like throughout
[01:52:26.010 --> 01:52:28.010]  trial and stuff for like a year and a half.
[01:52:28.010 --> 01:52:30.010]  Damn, before he even got processed through?
[01:52:30.010 --> 01:52:32.010]  Yeah. Is the trial over yet?
[01:52:32.010 --> 01:52:34.010]  I don't know. I didn't keep up with him.
[01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:36.010]  He was just somebody that I knew through involvement.
[01:52:36.010 --> 01:52:38.010]  Rough life. Yeah.
[01:52:38.010 --> 01:52:40.010]  I can't believe that.
[01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:42.010]  So I just took a fat hit off a joint and then I took a little
[01:52:42.010 --> 01:52:44.010]  decent sized dab of some live resin
[01:52:44.010 --> 01:52:46.010]  and I'm a high as giraffe
[01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.010]  pussy and I'm liking it. This is gonna be a fun
[01:52:48.010 --> 01:52:50.010]  episode you guys. Holy crap. I may need
[01:52:50.010 --> 01:52:52.010]  a seatbelt for my chair before we go too far
[01:52:52.010 --> 01:52:54.010]  here. Mike, you're quiet over there. What's on your mind,
[01:52:54.010 --> 01:52:56.010]  homie? I'm nice and high. This is fun.
[01:52:56.010 --> 01:52:58.010]  Mike showed up and the first thing we did was
[01:52:58.010 --> 01:53:00.010]  make sure we give him some dabs.
[01:53:00.010 --> 01:53:02.010]  When Slop said
[01:53:02.010 --> 01:53:04.010]  the bowl of acid
[01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:06.010]  it made me think of, did you happen to
[01:53:06.010 --> 01:53:08.010]  see the acid church that
[01:53:08.010 --> 01:53:10.010]  happened on Sunday?
[01:53:10.010 --> 01:53:12.010]  On Joey Diaz's? Anybody who
[01:53:12.010 --> 01:53:14.010]  listens to that out there?
[01:53:14.010 --> 01:53:16.010]  Well, actually, these guys
[01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:18.010]  have a podcast called The Church of What's Happening
[01:53:18.010 --> 01:53:20.010]  Now. It's one of my favorite podcasts. I'll give them a shout out.
[01:53:20.010 --> 01:53:22.010]  It's Joey Diaz and Lee Syatt.
[01:53:22.010 --> 01:53:24.010]  But Joey Diaz, Lee Syatt,
[01:53:24.010 --> 01:53:26.010]  and Ari Shafir went on the podcast
[01:53:26.010 --> 01:53:28.010]  and they ate acid together. With Eddie Bravo.
[01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:30.010]  Eddie Bravo did not
[01:53:30.010 --> 01:53:32.010]  eat acid. He wanted to be very clear that he was not
[01:53:32.010 --> 01:53:34.010]  eating acid. The other three ate
[01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:36.010]  a nice dose of acid and they were tripping.
[01:53:36.010 --> 01:53:38.010]  They were tripping face. They were giggling
[01:53:38.010 --> 01:53:40.010]  and then they went on Periscope a little bit later
[01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:42.010]  and Periscoped themselves all
[01:53:42.010 --> 01:53:44.010]  tripping and Ari Shafir was laying on the floor
[01:53:44.010 --> 01:53:46.010]  rubbing his head. Lee Syatt was
[01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:48.010]  smiling the size of the moon and
[01:53:48.010 --> 01:53:50.010]  Joey Diaz did not seem fazed at
[01:53:50.010 --> 01:53:52.010]  all by all the drugs that they had taken.
[01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:54.010]  He was sitting there eating 500 mg
[01:53:54.010 --> 01:53:56.010]  stars. Stars of death.
[01:53:56.010 --> 01:53:58.010]  The gummy bears. Gummy stars. Just eating them like they were
[01:53:58.010 --> 01:54:00.010]  candy. He's like, they kind of take the edge
[01:54:00.010 --> 01:54:02.010]  off, dog. That's all he was thinking.
[01:54:02.010 --> 01:54:04.010]  They take the edge off.
[01:54:04.010 --> 01:54:06.010]  We won't ever eat acid
[01:54:06.010 --> 01:54:08.010]  on this podcast, you guys. That's not going to happen.
[01:54:08.010 --> 01:54:10.010]  I might. I might. Well, maybe.
[01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:12.010]  I might just come to the edge. I might just
[01:54:12.010 --> 01:54:14.010]  pop something and kill him. I'll be real entertaining
[01:54:14.010 --> 01:54:16.010]  that night. Pulling my drink a little bit closer
[01:54:16.010 --> 01:54:18.010]  to me as everyone's talking about it.
[01:54:18.010 --> 01:54:20.010]  Mike's looking down at his mountain dew like,
[01:54:20.010 --> 01:54:22.010]  I'm not sure if I want to eat anymore.
[01:54:22.010 --> 01:54:24.010]  I leave the room. All these were open. You did.
[01:54:24.010 --> 01:54:26.010]  You went pee a minute ago. Could be a fun night.
[01:54:26.010 --> 01:54:28.010]  It could be a fun night for everybody.
[01:54:28.010 --> 01:54:30.010]  So if we start talking about colors and shit, you guys,
[01:54:30.010 --> 01:54:32.010]  it's because somebody in this room just fed us a bunch of acid.
[01:54:32.010 --> 01:54:34.010]  Yeah, we're Pixar movies.
[01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:36.010]  I start bringing up Pixar movies.
[01:54:36.010 --> 01:54:38.010]  The acid.
[01:54:38.010 --> 01:54:40.010]  Do you like Pixar movies,
[01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:42.010]  Sloppy? Are you a Minions fan?
[01:54:42.010 --> 01:54:44.010]  Yo. If you ever,
[01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:46.010]  if your first time taking acid,
[01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:48.010]  pop in a nice Pixar movie.
[01:54:48.010 --> 01:54:50.010]  If your first time taking acid, I might have
[01:54:50.010 --> 01:54:52.010]  taken a little bit too much from what I remember.
[01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:54.010]  I was with the greatest people to be ever.
[01:54:54.010 --> 01:54:56.010]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:54:56.010 --> 01:54:58.010]  You always feel like you've taken too much.
[01:54:58.010 --> 01:55:00.010]  What's the biggest dab you've ever taken, Sloppy?
[01:55:02.010 --> 01:55:04.010]  I'm pretty sure our friend Michael
[01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:06.010]  gave me like a gram dab
[01:55:06.010 --> 01:55:08.010]  once. Nice. I did a gram at the
[01:55:08.010 --> 01:55:10.010]  the Cannabis Cup
[01:55:10.010 --> 01:55:12.010]  and won a t-shirt and I almost threw up.
[01:55:12.010 --> 01:55:14.010]  Almost threw up? I've almost thrown up
[01:55:14.010 --> 01:55:16.010]  both times. The one time that Michael
[01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:18.010]  did it was during the Super Bowl and I
[01:55:18.010 --> 01:55:20.010]  literally took the dab, stood up in the middle
[01:55:20.010 --> 01:55:22.010]  of his house, took my shirt off and laid down
[01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:24.010]  on the floor.
[01:55:24.010 --> 01:55:26.010]  And I'm pretty sure I took a nap.
[01:55:26.010 --> 01:55:28.010]  Sometimes you just need a little rest after a big
[01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:30.010]  dab like that.
[01:55:30.010 --> 01:55:32.010]  I think if there were to be a dab contest
[01:55:32.010 --> 01:55:34.010]  in the room, I think the last two
[01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:36.010]  standers would probably be myself and Maddie.
[01:55:36.010 --> 01:55:38.010]  I'll be the first person out.
[01:55:38.010 --> 01:55:40.010]  Yeah, yeah. Spence has
[01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:42.010]  no shame in saying he does not take big
[01:55:42.010 --> 01:55:44.010]  dabs. He likes to take a whole bunch of little dabs
[01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:46.010]  and then his eyes turn
[01:55:46.010 --> 01:55:48.010]  as red as stoplights.
[01:55:48.010 --> 01:55:50.010]  He just
[01:55:50.010 --> 01:55:52.010]  looked into the microphone and nodded like the microphone
[01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:54.010]  could hear the nod. Yep.
[01:55:54.010 --> 01:55:56.010]  You high over there my friend?
[01:55:56.010 --> 01:55:58.010]  Yep. What was the other podcast you were on?
[01:55:58.010 --> 01:56:00.010]  Do you know the name? Cannabis Network Radio.
[01:56:00.010 --> 01:56:02.010]  Cannabis Network Radio. It's like the world's
[01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:04.010]  best weed podcast. The best weed show ever.
[01:56:04.010 --> 01:56:06.010]  The best weed show ever. Shout out to those guys.
[01:56:06.010 --> 01:56:08.010]  I'm working on getting myself booked for that show.
[01:56:08.010 --> 01:56:10.010]  We're going to be on there one time. That's going to be awesome.
[01:56:10.010 --> 01:56:12.010]  Yeah, shout out to all that crew.
[01:56:12.010 --> 01:56:14.010]  That whole crew. What up Hunt? Hey Hunt,
[01:56:14.010 --> 01:56:16.010]  I hope you're listening. Shout out to Damsel. Just random
[01:56:16.010 --> 01:56:18.010]  shout outs because we're at that point. Shout out.
[01:56:18.010 --> 01:56:20.010]  I feel the edible's kicking in obviously.
[01:56:20.010 --> 01:56:22.010]  Do we need to open another one of these you guys or is everybody
[01:56:22.010 --> 01:56:24.010]  edible-ied? Maddie
[01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:26.010]  just gave the... If there's that emoji
[01:56:26.010 --> 01:56:28.010]  with the little chick, give yourself a cross out.
[01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:30.010]  If you opened it, I would eat it.
[01:56:30.010 --> 01:56:32.010]  I'm with whatever you're with.
[01:56:32.010 --> 01:56:34.010]  We should not open
[01:56:34.010 --> 01:56:36.010]  it because we will eat it.
[01:56:36.010 --> 01:56:38.010]  Buzzy finally came in for the last piece. I knew that
[01:56:38.010 --> 01:56:40.010]  was going to happen. I've been waiting patiently for that.
[01:56:40.010 --> 01:56:42.010]  I think it's
[01:56:42.010 --> 01:56:44.010]  you know I eat edibles
[01:56:44.010 --> 01:56:46.010]  once every six months.
[01:56:46.010 --> 01:56:48.010]  We might as well do it right here.
[01:56:48.010 --> 01:56:50.010]  You got a big ol' smile on your face.
[01:56:50.010 --> 01:56:52.010]  I haven't seen you that smile in quite a while. I'm pretty
[01:56:52.010 --> 01:56:54.010]  happy. It's good to be in a room
[01:56:54.010 --> 01:56:56.010]  full of healthy people that are taking good care of themselves.
[01:56:56.010 --> 01:56:58.010]  We're not a bunch of lazy ass pot heads.
[01:56:58.010 --> 01:57:00.010]  These are a group of people that freaking do
[01:57:00.010 --> 01:57:02.010]  work. Spence can hoop.
[01:57:02.010 --> 01:57:04.010]  Spence plays some ball. Can you
[01:57:04.010 --> 01:57:06.010]  dunk on some fools?
[01:57:06.010 --> 01:57:08.010]  He just smiles and nods like uh-huh.
[01:57:08.010 --> 01:57:10.010]  I have dunked on some fools. The tallest dude I ever
[01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:12.010]  dunked on was like
[01:57:12.010 --> 01:57:14.010]  6'9". Damn. He was huge
[01:57:14.010 --> 01:57:16.010]  but he wasn't like 6'9".
[01:57:16.010 --> 01:57:18.010]  And like
[01:57:18.010 --> 01:57:20.010]  could jump out of the gym. He was like 6'9".
[01:57:20.010 --> 01:57:22.010]  And just giant.
[01:57:22.010 --> 01:57:24.010]  So he was glued to the ground pretty much.
[01:57:24.010 --> 01:57:26.010]  But he was, he could dunk
[01:57:26.010 --> 01:57:28.010]  because he was 6'9".
[01:57:28.010 --> 01:57:30.010]  But you could reach up and stuff it on him.
[01:57:30.010 --> 01:57:32.010]  How many times
[01:57:32.010 --> 01:57:34.010]  have you smacked a dude in the face with your own nuts?
[01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:36.010]  Just be honest.
[01:57:36.010 --> 01:57:38.010]  Zero times. That's never happened?
[01:57:38.010 --> 01:57:40.010]  I see it on YouTube all the time.
[01:57:40.010 --> 01:57:42.010]  Dunking is like the most shameful way to dunk
[01:57:42.010 --> 01:57:44.010]  on somebody. I thought you meant like really
[01:57:44.010 --> 01:57:46.010]  taking my balls in. Oh no, not like team bagging in like 6th grade
[01:57:46.010 --> 01:57:48.010]  or nothing. I'm talking about like dunking
[01:57:48.010 --> 01:57:50.010]  like backhand.
[01:57:50.010 --> 01:57:52.010]  When I was like in 10th grade
[01:57:52.010 --> 01:57:54.010]  the summer before my 10th grade we were
[01:57:54.010 --> 01:57:56.010]  playing in a basketball tournament and I literally
[01:57:56.010 --> 01:57:58.010]  caught a ball
[01:57:58.010 --> 01:58:00.010]  took two steps and jumped over a kid
[01:58:00.010 --> 01:58:02.010]  that was like, I mean he was probably only like
[01:58:02.010 --> 01:58:04.010]  6'0". But like I'm in 10th grade
[01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:06.010]  and I literally just Vince Carter'd over this dude.
[01:58:06.010 --> 01:58:08.010]  Like the referees
[01:58:08.010 --> 01:58:10.010]  were like alumni
[01:58:10.010 --> 01:58:12.010]  players, players who just come back for summer
[01:58:12.010 --> 01:58:14.010]  for money. And literally
[01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:16.010]  they just take off running out of the gym.
[01:58:16.010 --> 01:58:18.010]  The referees were like
[01:58:18.010 --> 01:58:20.010]  holy shit, he just jumped over
[01:58:20.010 --> 01:58:22.010]  somebody. That's so funny.
[01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:24.010]  But that was cool.
[01:58:24.010 --> 01:58:26.010]  I was really athletic but I think I'm a
[01:58:26.010 --> 01:58:28.010]  I always liked weed. It was never like
[01:58:28.010 --> 01:58:30.010]  besides when I was younger it was the only
[01:58:30.010 --> 01:58:32.010]  time I didn't really smoke. But once I got into like
[01:58:32.010 --> 01:58:34.010]  high school and like college
[01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:36.010]  I continued. I had two scholarships
[01:58:36.010 --> 01:58:38.010]  and I was still smoking weed. Can you hoop
[01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:40.010]  when you're high? Yeah, I think I play better
[01:58:40.010 --> 01:58:42.010]  when I'm high. It slows down.
[01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:44.010]  It's not so fast. As a musician that's what I noticed.
[01:58:44.010 --> 01:58:46.010]  I don't know if sometime it might be I'm slowed down.
[01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:48.010]  But you can
[01:58:48.010 --> 01:58:50.010]  shoot better right? It's a little more aim, a little
[01:58:50.010 --> 01:58:52.010]  like you get, normally time is going by
[01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:54.010]  about tick, tick, tick. But when you smoke some weed
[01:58:54.010 --> 01:58:56.010]  you get that tick, tick, tick.
[01:58:56.010 --> 01:58:58.010]  And when you're playing music
[01:58:58.010 --> 01:59:00.010]  I'll take a hit of that, why not? Let's smoke
[01:59:00.010 --> 01:59:02.010]  some flowers when there's flowers around. Thank you Joe.
[01:59:02.010 --> 01:59:04.010]  Not going to go bad,
[01:59:04.010 --> 01:59:06.010]  I'm trying to skip you. But now I gotta pass it.
[01:59:06.010 --> 01:59:08.010]  Now you're back to the where this joint goes
[01:59:08.010 --> 01:59:10.010]  game.
[01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:12.010]  But as a musician, when you're
[01:59:12.010 --> 01:59:14.010]  playing music you can just feel the time so much
[01:59:14.010 --> 01:59:16.010]  better when you're a little high. It feels like that beat is
[01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:18.010]  so much thicker. Like you got so much more room
[01:59:18.010 --> 01:59:20.010]  to play with that time that's coming by as a musician.
[01:59:20.010 --> 01:59:22.010]  I love it. Slop's nodding
[01:59:22.010 --> 01:59:24.010]  his head. You like to rap when you're all high Sloppy?
[01:59:24.010 --> 01:59:26.010]  Oh, I probably
[01:59:26.010 --> 01:59:28.010]  smoke a blunt perverse.
[01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:30.010]  A blunt perverse. Alright Snoop Dizzle.
[01:59:30.010 --> 01:59:32.010]  It just works out that way.
[01:59:32.010 --> 01:59:34.010]  Well I'll put it out
[01:59:34.010 --> 01:59:36.010]  and do some rap and spark it back up
[01:59:36.010 --> 01:59:38.010]  and stuff. It's not like the whole time I can't.
[01:59:38.010 --> 01:59:40.010]  The blunt doesn't fuck up your throat?
[01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:42.010]  I mean I sound alright right?
[01:59:42.010 --> 01:59:44.010]  You sound good buddy.
[01:59:44.010 --> 01:59:46.010]  I mean yo, I was going to say
[01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:48.010]  a second ago when y'all were like I love weed. Yo,
[01:59:48.010 --> 01:59:50.010]  we should all discuss like
[01:59:50.010 --> 01:59:52.010]  when we first smoked weed, it's the
[01:59:52.010 --> 01:59:54.010]  100th episode. Like what brought us
[01:59:54.010 --> 01:59:56.010]  to this community. You know, what was that
[01:59:56.010 --> 01:59:58.010]  first five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
[01:59:58.010 --> 02:00:00.010]  When's the first time you smoked weed? Since you're putting us on this
[02:00:00.010 --> 02:00:02.010]  I'll go with this. I like it. We're going to put you on the
[02:00:02.010 --> 02:00:04.010]  spotlight first. The first time I ever
[02:00:04.010 --> 02:00:06.010]  smoked weed was walking
[02:00:06.010 --> 02:00:08.010]  home from school. I was in
[02:00:08.010 --> 02:00:10.010]  fifth grade. My school was a
[02:00:10.010 --> 02:00:12.010]  fifth grade through twelfth grade in one
[02:00:12.010 --> 02:00:14.010]  school because the community was small
[02:00:14.010 --> 02:00:16.010]  and I didn't really know what the big kids were
[02:00:16.010 --> 02:00:18.010]  doing but they asked me if I wanted to smoke and
[02:00:18.010 --> 02:00:20.010]  I said yes. And I went to my friend
[02:00:20.010 --> 02:00:22.010]  Demetrius' house and we went to his shed
[02:00:22.010 --> 02:00:24.010]  and played Sega Genesis and smoked
[02:00:24.010 --> 02:00:26.010]  blunts while his grandma cooked us chicken
[02:00:26.010 --> 02:00:28.010]  and I remember it was
[02:00:28.010 --> 02:00:30.010]  shit. That shit just
[02:00:30.010 --> 02:00:32.010]  sounded like a Chappelle show.
[02:00:32.010 --> 02:00:34.010]  It was
[02:00:34.010 --> 02:00:36.010]  shitlins to be specific
[02:00:36.010 --> 02:00:38.010]  and it was the first time I had ever seen
[02:00:38.010 --> 02:00:40.010]  or smelled them and I was
[02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:42.010]  horrible. Horrible. Horrible.
[02:00:42.010 --> 02:00:44.010]  You gotta cook those outside.
[02:00:44.010 --> 02:00:46.010]  Can you remember what game you were playing? We were playing Golden Axe.
[02:00:46.010 --> 02:00:48.010]  It's one of the first co-op
[02:00:48.010 --> 02:00:50.010]  games on Sega Genesis
[02:00:50.010 --> 02:00:52.010]  and we used to sit in that shed and do it all the time.
[02:00:52.010 --> 02:00:54.010]  It was funny because I was so
[02:00:54.010 --> 02:00:56.010]  young that I didn't know what I did was wrong
[02:00:56.010 --> 02:00:58.010]  until I was about to leave
[02:00:58.010 --> 02:01:00.010]  when my mom pulled up and they were like, alright
[02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:02.010]  don't eat anything when you get
[02:01:02.010 --> 02:01:04.010]  home and go in your room and tell your mom you
[02:01:04.010 --> 02:01:06.010]  have a headache. And I was like, ah this seems
[02:01:06.010 --> 02:01:08.010]  weird.
[02:01:08.010 --> 02:01:10.010]  But that was every day and eventually my mom
[02:01:10.010 --> 02:01:12.010]  was like, why do you have so many headaches?
[02:01:12.010 --> 02:01:14.010]  I read. You're laughing a lot.
[02:01:14.010 --> 02:01:16.010]  Life is too good.
[02:01:16.010 --> 02:01:18.010]  What's wrong with you? You seem to be enjoying yourself.
[02:01:18.010 --> 02:01:20.010]  So you didn't even know that you were doing something bad?
[02:01:20.010 --> 02:01:22.010]  I mean
[02:01:22.010 --> 02:01:24.010]  my mom smoked cigarettes when I was younger
[02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:26.010]  so I saw people smoking.
[02:01:26.010 --> 02:01:28.010]  But nah, I was just like, I wanted
[02:01:28.010 --> 02:01:30.010]  to be a cool kid. It was 5th through
[02:01:30.010 --> 02:01:32.010]  12th grade. I was there with all older kids.
[02:01:32.010 --> 02:01:34.010]  It was a minority school
[02:01:34.010 --> 02:01:36.010]  I got integrated into
[02:01:36.010 --> 02:01:38.010]  so it was just like, you know, being
[02:01:38.010 --> 02:01:40.010]  the oddball out, I was like, well that's what they're doing
[02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:42.010]  let's do it. And then I did it
[02:01:42.010 --> 02:01:44.010]  and played those video games and I was like, this is
[02:01:44.010 --> 02:01:46.010]  the shit. And I have been playing video
[02:01:46.010 --> 02:01:48.010]  games and smoking weed since that day.
[02:01:48.010 --> 02:01:50.010]  And video games go together so damn
[02:01:50.010 --> 02:01:52.010]  well. So well. Going to a whole new
[02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:54.010]  level. Nice, nice. Does anybody
[02:01:54.010 --> 02:01:56.010]  else want to tell about the first time they got high?
[02:01:56.010 --> 02:01:58.010]  You don't have to if you don't want to, Joe. I want to hear it.
[02:01:58.010 --> 02:02:00.010]  Do it if you want to. Let's hear it.
[02:02:00.010 --> 02:02:02.010]  It's a pretty basic story. I was interested
[02:02:02.010 --> 02:02:04.010]  in it. I was hanging out with friends one day
[02:02:04.010 --> 02:02:06.010]  some people came with weed
[02:02:06.010 --> 02:02:08.010]  got smoked
[02:02:08.010 --> 02:02:10.010]  and I was like, okay, this is interesting.
[02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:12.010]  I can see why people enjoy this.
[02:02:12.010 --> 02:02:14.010]  And just kind of have
[02:02:14.010 --> 02:02:16.010]  ever since. How old are you?
[02:02:16.010 --> 02:02:18.010]  Don't mind me asking. I guess
[02:02:18.010 --> 02:02:20.010]  17. Okay.
[02:02:20.010 --> 02:02:22.010]  Seems about an appropriate age to start
[02:02:22.010 --> 02:02:24.010]  smoking. But it wasn't like
[02:02:24.010 --> 02:02:26.010]  the first year. It was really sporadic.
[02:02:26.010 --> 02:02:28.010]  Just like here and there. It was
[02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:30.010]  just like a curiosity. Okay.
[02:02:30.010 --> 02:02:32.010]  It got settled and then after that
[02:02:32.010 --> 02:02:34.010]  then I became interested in
[02:02:34.010 --> 02:02:36.010]  like more than just
[02:02:36.010 --> 02:02:38.010]  weed as a
[02:02:38.010 --> 02:02:40.010]  cool after school activity.
[02:02:40.010 --> 02:02:42.010]  So some other
[02:02:42.010 --> 02:02:44.010]  things took its place.
[02:02:44.010 --> 02:02:46.010]  I guess so. Okay.
[02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:48.010]  But yeah, that's all for that.
[02:02:48.010 --> 02:02:50.010]  That's all for that. I can tell by the look on your face
[02:02:50.010 --> 02:02:52.010]  not to go further with that question.
[02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:54.010]  Miss Maddie, do you want to tell us about the first time that you
[02:02:54.010 --> 02:02:56.010]  got to experience and play with the wonderful
[02:02:56.010 --> 02:02:58.010]  world of ganja and cannabis?
[02:02:58.010 --> 02:03:00.010]  I was really, really young. I can't really
[02:03:00.010 --> 02:03:02.010]  say my story on a podcast
[02:03:02.010 --> 02:03:04.010]  because I'm afraid that
[02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:06.010]  might not go so well.
[02:03:06.010 --> 02:03:08.010]  But I was really young. I was like
[02:03:08.010 --> 02:03:10.010]  13 when I like started
[02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:12.010]  smoking weed like once or twice a week.
[02:03:14.010 --> 02:03:16.010]  Yeah.
[02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:18.010]  Spencer just pointed out that Sloppy said 5th grade
[02:03:18.010 --> 02:03:20.010]  and Maddie's afraid to tell her story.
[02:03:20.010 --> 02:03:22.010]  No, I was not afraid.
[02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:24.010]  I think I know why.
[02:03:24.010 --> 02:03:26.010]  Out of respect.
[02:03:26.010 --> 02:03:28.010]  Word. Alright. So how old were you?
[02:03:28.010 --> 02:03:30.010]  I was young. I was like 13 when I started.
[02:03:30.010 --> 02:03:32.010]  I probably smoked weed before
[02:03:32.010 --> 02:03:34.010]  that. I started smoking cigarettes and stuff.
[02:03:34.010 --> 02:03:36.010]  I grew up in like a trailer park
[02:03:36.010 --> 02:03:38.010]  so you know it was kind of
[02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:40.010]  like around the edges. If you live in a trailer park
[02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:42.010]  you smoke cigarettes at 11.
[02:03:42.010 --> 02:03:44.010]  I started smoking and drinking really, really
[02:03:44.010 --> 02:03:46.010]  young so when weed was introduced to me
[02:03:46.010 --> 02:03:48.010]  it wasn't even like a question. I thought
[02:03:48.010 --> 02:03:50.010]  it was just something normal.
[02:03:50.010 --> 02:03:52.010]  Started at the trailer and now you're here.
[02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:54.010]  Almost just like Sloppy. Just didn't really realize
[02:03:54.010 --> 02:03:56.010]  what I was doing was wrong. I remember
[02:03:56.010 --> 02:03:58.010]  one day I sat in a DARE class because
[02:03:58.010 --> 02:04:00.010]  in North Carolina you have to go through DARE classes
[02:04:00.010 --> 02:04:02.010]  which is a drug awareness
[02:04:02.010 --> 02:04:04.010]  class. Drug Abuse Resistance
[02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:06.010]  Education. There we go.
[02:04:06.010 --> 02:04:08.010]  And they were talking about
[02:04:08.010 --> 02:04:10.010]  marijuana and they were saying
[02:04:10.010 --> 02:04:12.010]  Alright Nancy Grace over there. Marijuana.
[02:04:14.010 --> 02:04:16.010]  Yeah so I just remember that and I was like oh
[02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:18.010]  shit man maybe that stuff is bad
[02:04:18.010 --> 02:04:20.010]  but it's good.
[02:04:20.010 --> 02:04:22.010]  I was already hooked by the time I
[02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:24.010]  got into DARE.
[02:04:24.010 --> 02:04:26.010]  Alright Spence you know you're up next.
[02:04:26.010 --> 02:04:28.010]  When's the first time, what do you remember about
[02:04:28.010 --> 02:04:30.010]  the first time you smoked some weed? I think I smoked
[02:04:30.010 --> 02:04:32.010]  weed out of like a Sprite
[02:04:32.010 --> 02:04:34.010]  bottle when I was in like 9th grade.
[02:04:34.010 --> 02:04:36.010]  I didn't even know what
[02:04:36.010 --> 02:04:38.010]  getting high was so I didn't know
[02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:40.010]  what I was feeling. I was like
[02:04:40.010 --> 02:04:42.010]  I guess I'm
[02:04:42.010 --> 02:04:44.010]  high I don't know.
[02:04:44.010 --> 02:04:46.010]  And then I didn't really touch weed until I was
[02:04:46.010 --> 02:04:48.010]  like maybe sophomore
[02:04:48.010 --> 02:04:50.010]  the next year is when I was like actually
[02:04:50.010 --> 02:04:52.010]  smoking.
[02:04:52.010 --> 02:04:54.010]  Not like everyday but
[02:04:54.010 --> 02:04:56.010]  2 or 3 times a week I guess.
[02:04:56.010 --> 02:04:58.010]  Yeah whenever someone's got some weed whenever it
[02:04:58.010 --> 02:05:00.010]  comes up. Friday night or whatever.
[02:05:00.010 --> 02:05:02.010]  I think my interest changed when
[02:05:02.010 --> 02:05:04.010]  I found
[02:05:04.010 --> 02:05:06.010]  out about GoodWeed when I like first
[02:05:06.010 --> 02:05:08.010]  saw like
[02:05:08.010 --> 02:05:10.010]  cause everybody remembers Reggie
[02:05:10.010 --> 02:05:12.010]  like he smoked Reggie. Shit start off with that
[02:05:12.010 --> 02:05:14.010]  shitty break. Yeah then you see GoodWeed
[02:05:14.010 --> 02:05:16.010]  and it completely like
[02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:18.010]  changes your mind. It's like holy shit I'll never
[02:05:18.010 --> 02:05:20.010]  smoke that again.
[02:05:20.010 --> 02:05:22.010]  So weed is how you two started dating?
[02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:24.010]  Yeah he had really really good weed and I
[02:05:24.010 --> 02:05:26.010]  we had a mutual friend and I was like in North
[02:05:26.010 --> 02:05:28.010]  Carolina where we lived at the time was really hard
[02:05:28.010 --> 02:05:30.010]  to find weed so
[02:05:30.010 --> 02:05:32.010]  I got some from him and it was like
[02:05:32.010 --> 02:05:34.010]  super super good. It was the best weed I
[02:05:34.010 --> 02:05:36.010]  had ever seen like me and my friend were freaking
[02:05:36.010 --> 02:05:38.010]  out like we started smoking it and we were just
[02:05:38.010 --> 02:05:40.010]  giggling. Did you grow that weed Spence? No.
[02:05:40.010 --> 02:05:42.010]  It wasn't it was just like some really
[02:05:42.010 --> 02:05:44.010]  good stuff for where we were at and we just
[02:05:44.010 --> 02:05:46.010]  started hanging out after that. But that
[02:05:46.010 --> 02:05:48.010]  weed put you two together. Yep.
[02:05:48.010 --> 02:05:50.010]  How cute. If he had a had
[02:05:50.010 --> 02:05:52.010]  probably had bad weed I don't know like
[02:05:52.010 --> 02:05:54.010]  probably would have tried to hang out with him but
[02:05:54.010 --> 02:05:56.010]  probably wouldn't have bought weed from him anymore.
[02:05:56.010 --> 02:05:58.010]  That GoodWeed got you a good girl bro.
[02:05:58.010 --> 02:06:00.010]  Nice work. Nice work. Alright Mike
[02:06:00.010 --> 02:06:02.010]  we're gonna shift over to you bro. When's the first time
[02:06:02.010 --> 02:06:04.010]  you ever smoked some weed? Well
[02:06:04.010 --> 02:06:06.010]  we thought we were smoking weed when
[02:06:06.010 --> 02:06:08.010]  we were like 12 or 13 but now
[02:06:08.010 --> 02:06:10.010]  what I it was either the worst
[02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:12.010]  ditch weed ever or more
[02:06:12.010 --> 02:06:14.010]  than likely it was just what some older kids
[02:06:14.010 --> 02:06:16.010]  had sold us as weed
[02:06:16.010 --> 02:06:18.010]  and was actually mostly tobacco
[02:06:18.010 --> 02:06:20.010]  and like some oregano or something.
[02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:22.010]  Punk ass. But
[02:06:22.010 --> 02:06:24.010]  the first time I got
[02:06:24.010 --> 02:06:26.010]  like really high
[02:06:26.010 --> 02:06:28.010]  a friend of mine after school
[02:06:28.010 --> 02:06:30.010]  when I was like 15 was
[02:06:30.010 --> 02:06:32.010]  like hey you wanna go smoke? And I was like sure.
[02:06:32.010 --> 02:06:34.010]  And I thought they meant cigarettes.
[02:06:34.010 --> 02:06:36.010]  And we got in her car and drove off and I was like this is
[02:06:36.010 --> 02:06:38.010]  kind of ridiculous. I thought we were gonna go
[02:06:38.010 --> 02:06:40.010]  around the block what the hell is happening.
[02:06:40.010 --> 02:06:42.010]  And she blocked the way
[02:06:42.010 --> 02:06:44.010]  and we went
[02:06:44.010 --> 02:06:46.010]  to her garage and got
[02:06:46.010 --> 02:06:48.010]  stoned and it was the first time I
[02:06:48.010 --> 02:06:50.010]  ever smoked GoodWeed. We called it red hair.
[02:06:50.010 --> 02:06:52.010]  Which really which I
[02:06:52.010 --> 02:06:54.010]  think is yeah now that I know what I
[02:06:54.010 --> 02:06:56.010]  know about marijuana like we had no
[02:06:56.010 --> 02:06:58.010]  fucking clue what we were doing. We were just happy to
[02:06:58.010 --> 02:07:00.010]  have weed that was good.
[02:07:00.010 --> 02:07:02.010]  And I was stoned out of my mind
[02:07:02.010 --> 02:07:04.010]  and by this point in my life I had
[02:07:04.010 --> 02:07:06.010]  sat through dozens of hours
[02:07:06.010 --> 02:07:08.010]  of anti-drug education
[02:07:08.010 --> 02:07:10.010]  propaganda nonsense.
[02:07:10.010 --> 02:07:12.010]  And so when I finally got dropped off
[02:07:12.010 --> 02:07:14.010]  at my house I made it inside and flopped
[02:07:14.010 --> 02:07:16.010]  down in the guest bedroom
[02:07:16.010 --> 02:07:18.010]  thinking that I was gonna die
[02:07:18.010 --> 02:07:20.010]  and that my mom was gonna be one of
[02:07:20.010 --> 02:07:22.010]  those sad ass moms that goes to middle school
[02:07:22.010 --> 02:07:24.010]  like my son started smoking
[02:07:24.010 --> 02:07:26.010]  marijuana.
[02:07:26.010 --> 02:07:28.010]  I died like 10 years later after
[02:07:28.010 --> 02:07:30.010]  a horrible run of addiction.
[02:07:30.010 --> 02:07:32.010]  So don't do drugs kids.
[02:07:32.010 --> 02:07:34.010]  And then I woke up 3 hours later
[02:07:34.010 --> 02:07:36.010]  hungry as shit.
[02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:38.010]  But that's the first time I got really good
[02:07:38.010 --> 02:07:40.010]  and stoned.
[02:07:42.010 --> 02:07:44.010]  I got more high as you were telling that story.
[02:07:44.010 --> 02:07:46.010]  I was noticing that my edibles are working.
[02:07:46.010 --> 02:07:48.010]  They're definitely working. I'm 120
[02:07:48.010 --> 02:07:50.010]  milligrams deep and I can feel it.
[02:07:50.010 --> 02:07:52.010]  So now you've got your own little guy Mike. You've got your own little kid right?
[02:07:52.010 --> 02:07:54.010]  I do.
[02:07:54.010 --> 02:07:56.010]  How old would you prefer
[02:07:56.010 --> 02:07:58.010]  him to wait?
[02:07:58.010 --> 02:08:00.010]  I mean he's only pint sized now you guys.
[02:08:00.010 --> 02:08:02.010]  His water bottle is taller than Davey.
[02:08:02.010 --> 02:08:04.010]  At least late teens.
[02:08:04.010 --> 02:08:06.010]  Just like let the brain finish developing
[02:08:06.010 --> 02:08:08.010]  like I wish I would have waited like another
[02:08:08.010 --> 02:08:10.010]  couple of years.
[02:08:10.010 --> 02:08:12.010]  Mainly for the lungs
[02:08:12.010 --> 02:08:14.010]  but like if I could go back and not do something
[02:08:14.010 --> 02:08:16.010]  it would be not tobacco.
[02:08:16.010 --> 02:08:18.010]  Yeah bro you smoke way too many cigarettes.
[02:08:18.010 --> 02:08:20.010]  I do.
[02:08:20.010 --> 02:08:22.010]  But uh yeah wait till the late teens.
[02:08:22.010 --> 02:08:24.010]  Wait till the late teens.
[02:08:24.010 --> 02:08:26.010]  Let your brain finish growing. Learn all the shit they're trying to teach you in high school.
[02:08:26.010 --> 02:08:28.010]  Okay.
[02:08:28.010 --> 02:08:30.010]  So like how do you feel if he's like in like
[02:08:30.010 --> 02:08:32.010]  sophomore year, junior year and he's
[02:08:32.010 --> 02:08:34.010]  killing it with the grades.
[02:08:34.010 --> 02:08:36.010]  He's doing whatever. He's got a good job.
[02:08:36.010 --> 02:08:38.010]  He's you know working part time job.
[02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:40.010]  It's all about meeting your responsibilities.
[02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:42.010]  Alright so then as long as he's going to work at Village Inn on time
[02:08:42.010 --> 02:08:44.010]  or whatever he's doing and he's playing his guitar
[02:08:44.010 --> 02:08:46.010]  and doing his guitar lessons like he's supposed to
[02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:48.010]  and his grades are good.
[02:08:48.010 --> 02:08:50.010]  I'll still snatch it away.
[02:08:50.010 --> 02:08:52.010]  You better make sure he's smoking good shit too.
[02:08:52.010 --> 02:08:54.010]  You can't be smoking mid-grade in Mike's house.
[02:08:54.010 --> 02:08:56.010]  Quality control.
[02:08:56.010 --> 02:08:58.010]  But he'd still get in trouble for it and shit
[02:08:58.010 --> 02:09:00.010]  until he was out of my house.
[02:09:00.010 --> 02:09:02.010]  I wouldn't freak out
[02:09:02.010 --> 02:09:04.010]  if I found out my teenager was getting stoned.
[02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:06.010]  Joe looks like you got something to say.
[02:09:06.010 --> 02:09:08.010]  He just grabbed the mic.
[02:09:08.010 --> 02:09:10.010]  Oh yeah yeah I was going to wait.
[02:09:10.010 --> 02:09:12.010]  But uh
[02:09:12.010 --> 02:09:14.010]  yeah you should explain yours first before I
[02:09:14.010 --> 02:09:16.010]  totally change my mind.
[02:09:16.010 --> 02:09:18.010]  Oh the first time I smoked ganja.
[02:09:18.010 --> 02:09:20.010]  I was coming out the womb smoking a joint.
[02:09:20.010 --> 02:09:22.010]  Yeah man I was born with the dab rig.
[02:09:22.010 --> 02:09:24.010]  Nuh uh.
[02:09:24.010 --> 02:09:26.010]  Unfortunately I had
[02:09:26.010 --> 02:09:28.010]  a couple, I had three uncles who were
[02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:30.010]  pot smoking assholes the whole time
[02:09:30.010 --> 02:09:32.010]  I was growing up. So I grew up with
[02:09:32.010 --> 02:09:34.010]  I have an uncle Eric. Shout out to uncle Eric
[02:09:34.010 --> 02:09:36.010]  bro you don't listen to the show but shout out bro.
[02:09:36.010 --> 02:09:38.010]  Much love. I am kind of a clone of him.
[02:09:38.010 --> 02:09:40.010]  I grew up to become very much like him.
[02:09:40.010 --> 02:09:42.010]  I would hang out with him all the time.
[02:09:42.010 --> 02:09:44.010]  My uncles Rontra and Eric
[02:09:44.010 --> 02:09:46.010]  would hang out and smoke. They had a bong that was
[02:09:46.010 --> 02:09:48.010]  the color, remember those old school 70's bongs
[02:09:48.010 --> 02:09:50.010]  it looks like it's pistol grip in the front it's got a
[02:09:50.010 --> 02:09:52.010]  carb up here by your thumb. The bowl comes
[02:09:52.010 --> 02:09:54.010]  out of the middle and then it's got like a dick mouth piece that
[02:09:54.010 --> 02:09:56.010]  comes off of it and it's funky shaped looks like it was made
[02:09:56.010 --> 02:09:58.010]  in ceramics class. They would sit
[02:09:58.010 --> 02:10:00.010]  in a room and just smoke out of that fucking bong
[02:10:00.010 --> 02:10:02.010]  all the time. It was that like weird shitty
[02:10:02.010 --> 02:10:04.010]  ceramic shiny glass looking thing.
[02:10:04.010 --> 02:10:06.010]  Uh and they had to babysit me all the time.
[02:10:06.010 --> 02:10:08.010]  And so hanging out in that
[02:10:08.010 --> 02:10:10.010]  room I got stoned as
[02:10:10.010 --> 02:10:12.010]  fuck as a little kid but I didn't realize that's what was
[02:10:12.010 --> 02:10:14.010]  happening. I was just like I don't know wow.
[02:10:14.010 --> 02:10:16.010]  Like I just knew something was weird.
[02:10:16.010 --> 02:10:18.010]  And then they took me
[02:10:18.010 --> 02:10:20.010]  to a concert. My uncles Eric
[02:10:20.010 --> 02:10:22.010]  and Ron took
[02:10:22.010 --> 02:10:24.010]  me to a concert. I won't even say the name of
[02:10:24.010 --> 02:10:26.010]  the band because it was some cheesy hair bands.
[02:10:26.010 --> 02:10:28.010]  But it was cool I got to go with my uncles
[02:10:28.010 --> 02:10:30.010]  and it was in Long Beach in California.
[02:10:30.010 --> 02:10:32.010]  So we were in an El Camino.
[02:10:32.010 --> 02:10:34.010]  It's like a small truck and they were in the front and I was
[02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.010]  in the back and they decided to smoke
[02:10:36.010 --> 02:10:38.010]  a joint on the way and
[02:10:38.010 --> 02:10:40.010]  play the Black album from Metallica.
[02:10:40.010 --> 02:10:42.010]  And that was a life changing
[02:10:42.010 --> 02:10:44.010]  drive. That's what made me a drummer. That's part
[02:10:44.010 --> 02:10:46.010]  of what made me a pothead. I got
[02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:48.010]  so stoned from the joint they smoked.
[02:10:48.010 --> 02:10:50.010]  All the smoke blew right in the back of the fucking
[02:10:50.010 --> 02:10:52.010]  vehicle. And I was just sitting there just
[02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:54.010]  cheefed. And they knew it too. They were laughing at me.
[02:10:54.010 --> 02:10:56.010]  They were like you got high. And I was like
[02:10:56.010 --> 02:10:58.010]  I'm fucking high bro. Like official
[02:10:58.010 --> 02:11:00.010]  high. But I never hit the joint.
[02:11:00.010 --> 02:11:02.010]  And they played that Black album from Metallica.
[02:11:02.010 --> 02:11:04.010]  And by the time we got back
[02:11:04.010 --> 02:11:06.010]  I was already figuring out how I was going to go buy that album
[02:11:06.010 --> 02:11:08.010]  the next day. I was like I'm a Metallica head
[02:11:08.010 --> 02:11:10.010]  and I want to get high all the time. This is what I love.
[02:11:10.010 --> 02:11:12.010]  This is life.
[02:11:12.010 --> 02:11:14.010]  Yeah. That just
[02:11:14.010 --> 02:11:16.010]  changed some shit. And then shortly after that my
[02:11:16.010 --> 02:11:18.010]  friend Chris Ruth smoked me out and got me stupid
[02:11:18.010 --> 02:11:20.010]  high. And we were
[02:11:20.010 --> 02:11:22.010]  in the parking lot of my elementary school.
[02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:24.010]  I wasn't in elementary school anymore at this time.
[02:11:24.010 --> 02:11:26.010]  I was an adult by now.
[02:11:26.010 --> 02:11:28.010]  Smoked a joint or a bowl
[02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:30.010]  with my buddy Chris Ruth. Probably
[02:11:30.010 --> 02:11:32.010]  how old was I?
[02:11:32.010 --> 02:11:34.010]  I'm going to say 7th grade. Because I left California
[02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:36.010]  before 9th grade. Before 10th grade.
[02:11:36.010 --> 02:11:38.010]  How old was I? I was about 7th grade when I
[02:11:38.010 --> 02:11:40.010]  first smoked weed with Chris Ruth.
[02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:42.010]  I didn't smoke for a long time. He would get me
[02:11:42.010 --> 02:11:44.010]  so high that I didn't like it. It was too
[02:11:44.010 --> 02:11:46.010]  much. He was trying to
[02:11:46.010 --> 02:11:48.010]  he thought it was funny. But he would get me so fucking high
[02:11:48.010 --> 02:11:50.010]  that I didn't even enjoy it.
[02:11:50.010 --> 02:11:52.010]  I came out here and then I met up with
[02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:54.010]  some friends and they were smoking a bowl.
[02:11:54.010 --> 02:11:56.010]  And I was like oh man I remember that. And I took a
[02:11:56.010 --> 02:11:58.010]  hit off of it. And I didn't get stupid high because they were smoking
[02:11:58.010 --> 02:12:00.010]  mids. In Cali they were smoking good weed. And I heard
[02:12:00.010 --> 02:12:02.010]  they were smoking shitty weed. So I could smoke that.
[02:12:02.010 --> 02:12:04.010]  So I got some training wheels and I learned how to really
[02:12:04.010 --> 02:12:06.010]  smoke good weed.
[02:12:06.010 --> 02:12:08.010]  Fucking dab monster.
[02:12:08.010 --> 02:12:10.010]  I want to take a fat dab. I'm really
[02:12:10.010 --> 02:12:12.010]  high. But I want to take a fat dab. Because this is
[02:12:12.010 --> 02:12:14.010]  episode 100 you guys.
[02:12:14.010 --> 02:12:16.010]  Let's take a dab of some
[02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:18.010]  gorilla glue.
[02:12:18.010 --> 02:12:20.010]  This slab is vanishing
[02:12:20.010 --> 02:12:22.010]  rapidly. I've been dabbing the shit out of this.
[02:12:22.010 --> 02:12:24.010]  This was uh. Who grew this?
[02:12:24.010 --> 02:12:26.010]  We did. We did. Team
[02:12:26.010 --> 02:12:28.010]  Weeden grew this. Team Weeden extracted it.
[02:12:28.010 --> 02:12:30.010]  There's a lot of stuff that I don't really
[02:12:30.010 --> 02:12:32.010]  if anything it's from us
[02:12:32.010 --> 02:12:34.010]  it's most like
[02:12:34.010 --> 02:12:36.010]  90% of it's grown.
[02:12:36.010 --> 02:12:38.010]  Yeah you guys brought some sour diesel live
[02:12:38.010 --> 02:12:40.010]  resin that is just some fire. And I don't know what this
[02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:42.010]  live is you gave me the other day but holy shit that
[02:12:42.010 --> 02:12:44.010]  one's tasty. That dab alive
[02:12:44.010 --> 02:12:46.010]  death by lemons.
[02:12:46.010 --> 02:12:48.010]  That's why when I hit it it tastes like a damn
[02:12:48.010 --> 02:12:50.010]  mouthful of lemons. What you got over there Maddy?
[02:12:50.010 --> 02:12:52.010]  Some death.
[02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:54.010]  Some New York City diesel. It's like life by lemons
[02:12:54.010 --> 02:12:56.010]  there's no death to it.
[02:12:56.010 --> 02:12:58.010]  We should all exaggerate about how big this
[02:12:58.010 --> 02:13:00.010]  dab is. This is at least a gram right?
[02:13:00.010 --> 02:13:02.010]  No I'm not kidding. I'm just kidding you guys. I can't do a
[02:13:02.010 --> 02:13:04.010]  gram dab and keep this show going. I'm already fucked up
[02:13:04.010 --> 02:13:06.010]  on edibles. I feel like Joey Diaz. I'm all
[02:13:06.010 --> 02:13:08.010]  fucked up on edibles dog.
[02:13:08.010 --> 02:13:10.010]  I feel more like Lee Syatt at this point.
[02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:12.010]  I'm gonna take a dab. Somebody else say something.
[02:13:12.010 --> 02:13:14.010]  It's incredible how Joey
[02:13:14.010 --> 02:13:16.010]  corrupted Lee truly
[02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:18.010]  took this innocent boy and
[02:13:18.010 --> 02:13:20.010]  turned him into
[02:13:20.010 --> 02:13:22.010]  uh a real
[02:13:22.010 --> 02:13:24.010]  stoner and psychedelic
[02:13:24.010 --> 02:13:26.010]  adventurer. Yeah that guy went
[02:13:26.010 --> 02:13:28.010]  from being afraid to smoke a joint to
[02:13:28.010 --> 02:13:30.010]  eating 500 milligrams of edibles
[02:13:30.010 --> 02:13:32.010]  every podcast that he's on now. I'm impressed.
[02:13:34.010 --> 02:13:36.010]  He eats more edibles on every
[02:13:36.010 --> 02:13:38.010]  show than we've all eaten tonight combined.
[02:13:38.010 --> 02:13:40.010]  Maddy how much edibles did you eat?
[02:13:40.010 --> 02:13:42.010]  At least 600 milligrams
[02:13:42.010 --> 02:13:44.010]  or 60 milligrams.
[02:13:44.010 --> 02:13:46.010]  600?
[02:13:46.010 --> 02:13:48.010]  I know I'm high. There's 60.
[02:13:48.010 --> 02:13:50.010]  Alright I see a shuffle
[02:13:50.010 --> 02:13:52.010]  happening.
[02:13:52.010 --> 02:13:54.010]  Maddy just got up and bailed you guys. She's like
[02:13:54.010 --> 02:13:56.010]  fuck it I'm out.
[02:13:56.010 --> 02:13:58.010]  Had enough of this taco stand.
[02:13:58.010 --> 02:14:00.010]  No I just had a third
[02:14:00.010 --> 02:14:02.010]  I'm just picking on you.
[02:14:02.010 --> 02:14:04.010]  Thanks for coming back. Thanks for not leaving forever.
[02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:06.010]  Alright that
[02:14:06.010 --> 02:14:08.010]  dab's working in my brain. Somebody better say something
[02:14:08.010 --> 02:14:10.010]  halfway intelligent.
[02:14:10.010 --> 02:14:12.010]  What y'all wanna talk about?
[02:14:12.010 --> 02:14:14.010]  This room just went silent. It's episode 100.
[02:14:14.010 --> 02:14:16.010]  Do you guys, how many times have you
[02:14:16.010 --> 02:14:18.010]  been on the show Spence?
[02:14:18.010 --> 02:14:20.010]  Probably like 6 or 7 times
[02:14:20.010 --> 02:14:22.010]  maybe. Do you have a moment that stands out to you really
[02:14:22.010 --> 02:14:24.010]  well?
[02:14:24.010 --> 02:14:26.010]  No.
[02:14:26.010 --> 02:14:28.010]  I like all of them. The shows are fun.
[02:14:28.010 --> 02:14:30.010]  It's a fun show right? Taking big ol' fatty dabs
[02:14:30.010 --> 02:14:32.010]  and hanging out. I really like when
[02:14:32.010 --> 02:14:34.010]  Jesse's here because Jesse gets
[02:14:34.010 --> 02:14:36.010]  so high when he's hanging out
[02:14:36.010 --> 02:14:38.010]  with all of us cause he just keeps taking dabs
[02:14:38.010 --> 02:14:40.010]  with us. I think it's hilarious.
[02:14:40.010 --> 02:14:42.010]  He always tries to say
[02:14:42.010 --> 02:14:44.010]  I didn't eat anything today.
[02:14:44.010 --> 02:14:46.010]  But we know he ate. He's a big ol' dude. He knows he ate
[02:14:46.010 --> 02:14:48.010]  a bunch. He grows food. You know
[02:14:48.010 --> 02:14:50.010]  he ate something.
[02:14:50.010 --> 02:14:52.010]  Buzzy you were on one time. What was
[02:14:52.010 --> 02:14:54.010]  your favorite moment from the time you were on?
[02:14:54.010 --> 02:14:56.010]  That everybody
[02:14:56.010 --> 02:14:58.010]  really heard podcast number 2.
[02:14:58.010 --> 02:15:00.010]  I would have never told anybody
[02:15:00.010 --> 02:15:02.010]  about that. Oh this episode 100 is all good.
[02:15:02.010 --> 02:15:04.010]  Just totally
[02:15:04.010 --> 02:15:06.010]  messed up the first episode.
[02:15:06.010 --> 02:15:08.010]  Some people get stage fright a little bit when we hit
[02:15:08.010 --> 02:15:10.010]  record. Some people go blank as soon as you hit the
[02:15:10.010 --> 02:15:12.010]  record button. Talkative people go silent.
[02:15:12.010 --> 02:15:14.010]  So we had Buzzy on one night
[02:15:14.010 --> 02:15:16.010]  and he was talking and he just went blank
[02:15:16.010 --> 02:15:18.010]  from a dab. So we had to piece together two
[02:15:18.010 --> 02:15:20.010]  episodes and we made a great episode.
[02:15:20.010 --> 02:15:22.010]  It wasn't bad at all. But I'm glad you enjoyed
[02:15:22.010 --> 02:15:24.010]  take 2. Oh yeah.
[02:15:24.010 --> 02:15:26.010]  I hadn't dabbed
[02:15:26.010 --> 02:15:28.010]  in a while
[02:15:28.010 --> 02:15:30.010]  and I took one and I was
[02:15:30.010 --> 02:15:32.010]  just gone. Yeah and it was a
[02:15:32.010 --> 02:15:34.010]  rise which is straight sativa. And it took a minute
[02:15:34.010 --> 02:15:36.010]  to recover. Yeah it did.
[02:15:36.010 --> 02:15:38.010]  Gain some
[02:15:38.010 --> 02:15:40.010]  composure.
[02:15:40.010 --> 02:15:42.010]  Yeah gain anything back.
[02:15:42.010 --> 02:15:44.010]  Anything. Yeah your color.
[02:15:44.010 --> 02:15:46.010]  Sloppy sloppy. It's your second
[02:15:46.010 --> 02:15:48.010]  time on the show right? Indeed.
[02:15:48.010 --> 02:15:50.010]  What's your favorite moment? It could be from any episode
[02:15:50.010 --> 02:15:52.010]  not just one that you were on I guess. What's your favorite moment
[02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:54.010]  from the show so far?
[02:15:54.010 --> 02:15:56.010]  Probably this one. Was it just being all
[02:15:56.010 --> 02:15:58.010]  edible high? To be real. Are you Chinese?
[02:15:58.010 --> 02:16:00.010]  Are you part Chinese?
[02:16:00.010 --> 02:16:02.010]  Do you have any Asian in your blood?
[02:16:02.010 --> 02:16:04.010]  Because you look like you might be Asian today.
[02:16:04.010 --> 02:16:06.010]  Just grandma's edibles.
[02:16:06.010 --> 02:16:08.010]  Yeah not this
[02:16:08.010 --> 02:16:10.010]  one. Everybody here just chilling out.
[02:16:10.010 --> 02:16:12.010]  I really enjoy this. This is nice.
[02:16:12.010 --> 02:16:14.010]  Hey Jesse we wish you were here bro.
[02:16:14.010 --> 02:16:16.010]  Oh slack ass.
[02:16:16.010 --> 02:16:18.010]  He had important
[02:16:18.010 --> 02:16:20.010]  shit to handle so no worries.
[02:16:20.010 --> 02:16:22.010]  I don't know what's going on.
[02:16:22.010 --> 02:16:24.010]  Thanks for coming and getting edible
[02:16:24.010 --> 02:16:26.010]  drunk with us. For sure. It's going to be a fun
[02:16:26.010 --> 02:16:28.010]  night. Mike you've been on the show how many times
[02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:30.010]  dude? I don't even know.
[02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:32.010]  Over 99 times.
[02:16:32.010 --> 02:16:34.010]  Yeah like probably like 20-25 times
[02:16:34.010 --> 02:16:36.010]  maybe closer to 50. I really don't
[02:16:36.010 --> 02:16:38.010]  know. How many other
[02:16:38.010 --> 02:16:40.010]  girls have been on the podcast?
[02:16:40.010 --> 02:16:42.010]  Angela.
[02:16:42.010 --> 02:16:44.010]  One time I did a live show
[02:16:44.010 --> 02:16:46.010]  at another location
[02:16:46.010 --> 02:16:48.010]  and there were 2 or 3 women on the show
[02:16:48.010 --> 02:16:50.010]  there but they didn't come here where we
[02:16:50.010 --> 02:16:52.010]  normally record. I did a show
[02:16:52.010 --> 02:16:54.010]  from the... I remember
[02:16:54.010 --> 02:16:56.010]  we were trying to open up a smokers
[02:16:56.010 --> 02:16:58.010]  club kind of thing. Like a public
[02:16:58.010 --> 02:17:00.010]  consumption place and there was Misty
[02:17:00.010 --> 02:17:02.010]  and
[02:17:02.010 --> 02:17:04.010]  Terry and
[02:17:04.010 --> 02:17:06.010]  I think there was another lady on the show so
[02:17:06.010 --> 02:17:08.010]  there have been like 3 or 4 or 4 or 5
[02:17:08.010 --> 02:17:10.010]  ladies on the show but you're the one that's been on the
[02:17:10.010 --> 02:17:12.010]  most. You should do an all girls podcast.
[02:17:12.010 --> 02:17:14.010]  Can I be there too?
[02:17:14.010 --> 02:17:16.010]  Desperate dab wives?
[02:17:16.010 --> 02:17:18.010]  No with you but like just like have all the...
[02:17:18.010 --> 02:17:20.010]  So myself and you and
[02:17:20.010 --> 02:17:22.010]  who else? You gotta bring ladies. There's some girls
[02:17:22.010 --> 02:17:24.010]  from the springs that grow.
[02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:26.010]  Damsel.
[02:17:26.010 --> 02:17:28.010]  Hey Damsel you're invited to the show. She'll be on eventually.
[02:17:28.010 --> 02:17:30.010]  We're doing a project together so she'll be here.
[02:17:30.010 --> 02:17:32.010]  Yeah but I can think of a few girls that grow that would love
[02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:34.010]  to come on the podcast. Alright so if you can
[02:17:34.010 --> 02:17:36.010]  get them on we'll do the show. You let me know
[02:17:36.010 --> 02:17:38.010]  whenever 2 or 3 other grower
[02:17:38.010 --> 02:17:40.010]  girls will be on the show. Maybe I can make that happen. Grower girls.
[02:17:40.010 --> 02:17:42.010]  Grower girls if you're in the Colorado Springs, Pueblo
[02:17:42.010 --> 02:17:44.010]  or Denver area and you'd like to be on a podcast
[02:17:44.010 --> 02:17:46.010]  Hit us up. Sounds like we're a game show all
[02:17:46.010 --> 02:17:48.010]  of a sudden. If you'd like to be on a show
[02:17:48.010 --> 02:17:50.010]  let us know.
[02:17:50.010 --> 02:17:52.010]  Yeah hit up either Maddie or myself
[02:17:52.010 --> 02:17:54.010]  we didn't give out Maddie's
[02:17:54.010 --> 02:17:56.010]  Twitter or Instagram
[02:17:56.010 --> 02:17:58.010]  stuff. How do you find us Maddie? I am only on Instagram.
[02:17:58.010 --> 02:18:00.010]  How do we find you on Instagram Maddie?
[02:18:00.010 --> 02:18:02.010]  Losing my voice.
[02:18:02.010 --> 02:18:04.010]  Is Maddie M-A-D-I-G-B
[02:18:04.010 --> 02:18:06.010]  underscore
[02:18:06.010 --> 02:18:08.010]  growin. Maddie G-B
[02:18:08.010 --> 02:18:10.010]  growin.
[02:18:10.010 --> 02:18:12.010]  Growin.
[02:18:12.010 --> 02:18:14.010]  And we all know how to find Spence
[02:18:14.010 --> 02:18:16.010]  it's at Garden of Weeden.
[02:18:16.010 --> 02:18:18.010]  Hashtag follow Mike
[02:18:18.010 --> 02:18:20.010]  at Team Weeden
[02:18:20.010 --> 02:18:22.010]  710. Team Weeden 710.
[02:18:22.010 --> 02:18:24.010]  Is that your new one? Who is that?
[02:18:24.010 --> 02:18:26.010]  It's Mike. That's Mike? I thought Mike was
[02:18:26.010 --> 02:18:28.010]  We had to convert
[02:18:28.010 --> 02:18:30.010]  him from call me big
[02:18:30.010 --> 02:18:32.010]  Mike to a Garden of Weeden
[02:18:32.010 --> 02:18:34.010]  related.
[02:18:34.010 --> 02:18:36.010]  Yours is great Maddie you don't need to change yours.
[02:18:36.010 --> 02:18:38.010]  Maddie G-B Weeden.
[02:18:38.010 --> 02:18:40.010]  Yeah Maddie G-B Weeden.
[02:18:40.010 --> 02:18:42.010]  Yo I thought that big Mike was
[02:18:42.010 --> 02:18:44.010]  a perpetrator when
[02:18:44.010 --> 02:18:46.010]  he first changed it over.
[02:18:46.010 --> 02:18:48.010]  I was like who's this person? And I started
[02:18:48.010 --> 02:18:50.010]  looking and I was like this is weird.
[02:18:50.010 --> 02:18:52.010]  I was about to hit him up and be like somebody stole your identity
[02:18:52.010 --> 02:18:54.010]  and made a new profile.
[02:18:54.010 --> 02:18:56.010]  Team Weeden 710. What's wrong
[02:18:56.010 --> 02:18:58.010]  with these people? You can't be doing none of that.
[02:18:58.010 --> 02:19:00.010]  I need a seatbelt
[02:19:00.010 --> 02:19:02.010]  on this chair I feel like I'm about to fly away.
[02:19:02.010 --> 02:19:04.010]  Maddie you've got a big old grin
[02:19:04.010 --> 02:19:06.010]  and you're like rocking back and forth like Ray Charles
[02:19:06.010 --> 02:19:08.010]  over there. You need a piano? You want to write me
[02:19:08.010 --> 02:19:10.010]  a melody?
[02:19:10.010 --> 02:19:12.010]  I need food. Spence needs some
[02:19:12.010 --> 02:19:14.010]  food. I need food.
[02:19:14.010 --> 02:19:16.010]  Let's take another dab and then let's
[02:19:16.010 --> 02:19:18.010]  start saying goodbye to all of our friends.
[02:19:18.010 --> 02:19:20.010]  We got a whole bunch of cool ass people at the table
[02:19:20.010 --> 02:19:22.010]  you guys. I want to thank everybody for coming.
[02:19:22.010 --> 02:19:24.010]  Yeah shout out to everybody for
[02:19:24.010 --> 02:19:26.010]  getting out of the house.
[02:19:26.010 --> 02:19:28.010]  You know me I'm a homebody.
[02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:30.010]  I don't be out here
[02:19:30.010 --> 02:19:32.010]  but I'm out here.
[02:19:32.010 --> 02:19:34.010]  Everybody's got a garden to tend to. Mike's got a baby
[02:19:34.010 --> 02:19:36.010]  to take care of. Yeah.
[02:19:36.010 --> 02:19:38.010]  It took a little effort to get everybody here so thanks guys
[02:19:38.010 --> 02:19:40.010]  for coming. Everybody showed up at 710 on a
[02:19:40.010 --> 02:19:42.010]  Thursday evening. Everybody was on time.
[02:19:42.010 --> 02:19:44.010]  That's fucking impressive. I appreciate you guys.
[02:19:44.010 --> 02:19:46.010]  This is a great team to have in your arsenal.
[02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:48.010]  You want a dab brother? A dab for Spence.
[02:19:48.010 --> 02:19:50.010]  He's already hungry. We're just giving him a dab
[02:19:50.010 --> 02:19:52.010]  to entice him to hang out for a minute.
[02:19:52.010 --> 02:19:54.010]  Yeah we're like open for you over here.
[02:19:54.010 --> 02:19:56.010]  You get a dab.
[02:19:56.010 --> 02:19:58.010]  Anybody over there need a dab?
[02:19:58.010 --> 02:20:00.010]  I will never say no to a dab.
[02:20:00.010 --> 02:20:02.010]  Unless it's like black.
[02:20:02.010 --> 02:20:04.010]  Unless it's black.
[02:20:04.010 --> 02:20:06.010]  And that's not a
[02:20:06.010 --> 02:20:08.010]  that has nothing to do
[02:20:08.010 --> 02:20:10.010]  with it. It's not a racial thing. You just don't want to
[02:20:10.010 --> 02:20:12.010]  smoke that black slabeth. I get it.
[02:20:12.010 --> 02:20:14.010]  Sometimes it's a little scary smoking some janky hash.
[02:20:14.010 --> 02:20:16.010]  Yeah for sure. So what's the best way to handle that?
[02:20:16.010 --> 02:20:18.010]  That's a good thing we can talk about here for the last couple of minutes
[02:20:18.010 --> 02:20:20.010]  on the show while we take a dab and wrap up.
[02:20:20.010 --> 02:20:22.010]  This will be our little wrap up conversation. Just say no.
[02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:24.010]  What's a good way to handle that? Right now
[02:20:24.010 --> 02:20:26.010]  if somebody was like, Matty you alright bro?
[02:20:26.010 --> 02:20:28.010]  You tripping? I just
[02:20:28.010 --> 02:20:30.010]  this happens all the time when people
[02:20:30.010 --> 02:20:32.010]  offer you stuff and you just like
[02:20:32.010 --> 02:20:34.010]  you don't want to take it at all and you have to politely
[02:20:34.010 --> 02:20:36.010]  think of a way to do that. So yeah what's the way to do that?
[02:20:36.010 --> 02:20:38.010]  What's the best way to handle that you guys? What is the most
[02:20:38.010 --> 02:20:40.010]  what's the most... You literally
[02:20:40.010 --> 02:20:42.010]  have to just
[02:20:42.010 --> 02:20:44.010]  educate them for it.
[02:20:44.010 --> 02:20:46.010]  Pass that dab to the sloppy formula please sir.
[02:20:46.010 --> 02:20:48.010]  My new thing is is I only
[02:20:48.010 --> 02:20:50.010]  smoke stuff that I know
[02:20:50.010 --> 02:20:52.010]  personally where it's grown
[02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:54.010]  and processed at.
[02:20:54.010 --> 02:20:56.010]  If I don't know that then I'm not going to
[02:20:56.010 --> 02:20:58.010]  smoke it and it's nothing personal.
[02:20:58.010 --> 02:21:00.010]  I personally think it's
[02:21:00.010 --> 02:21:02.010]  I think it's rude to
[02:21:02.010 --> 02:21:04.010]  see somebody smoking something bad for
[02:21:04.010 --> 02:21:06.010]  them and not inform them. Like they may
[02:21:06.010 --> 02:21:08.010]  get like you know
[02:21:08.010 --> 02:21:10.010]  even if they get defensive about it
[02:21:10.010 --> 02:21:12.010]  like don't try to be confrontational
[02:21:12.010 --> 02:21:14.010]  with it but at least you can feel good at the end of the
[02:21:14.010 --> 02:21:16.010]  day like hey I told that dude he's
[02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:18.010]  smoking something that's going to kill him.
[02:21:18.010 --> 02:21:20.010]  Because like if I saw somebody drop
[02:21:20.010 --> 02:21:22.010]  some rat poison and some lasagna
[02:21:22.010 --> 02:21:24.010]  and then put it at the table
[02:21:24.010 --> 02:21:26.010]  I'd definitely look at y'all and be like hey
[02:21:26.010 --> 02:21:28.010]  there's no reason to eat this damn
[02:21:28.010 --> 02:21:30.010]  lasagna.
[02:21:30.010 --> 02:21:32.010]  So I just think
[02:21:32.010 --> 02:21:34.010]  it's wrong not to be like I would just
[02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:36.010]  look at it and be like hey
[02:21:36.010 --> 02:21:38.010]  I don't want to like you
[02:21:38.010 --> 02:21:40.010]  know offend you in any way but I don't feel comfortable
[02:21:40.010 --> 02:21:42.010]  smoking that and this is why.
[02:21:42.010 --> 02:21:44.010]  Because da da da da da da da.
[02:21:44.010 --> 02:21:46.010]  Kind of looks like boo boo my friend.
[02:21:46.010 --> 02:21:48.010]  I've seen Spencer just get up and walk away.
[02:21:48.010 --> 02:21:50.010]  Right before his dab is up.
[02:21:50.010 --> 02:21:52.010]  Spencer will look at you like
[02:21:52.010 --> 02:21:54.010]  I've left
[02:21:54.010 --> 02:21:56.010]  my big places and I'm like
[02:21:56.010 --> 02:21:58.010]  oh he's eating a dab.
[02:21:58.010 --> 02:22:00.010]  And that's
[02:22:00.010 --> 02:22:02.010]  what I that's would have been my solution.
[02:22:02.010 --> 02:22:04.010]  When he pulls out boo boo I'm like oh why don't you
[02:22:04.010 --> 02:22:06.010]  take a dab of this and just give that to them and then
[02:22:06.010 --> 02:22:08.010]  yeah. Saying or nah
[02:22:08.010 --> 02:22:10.010]  in kind of a high pitched voice is always
[02:22:10.010 --> 02:22:12.010]  acceptable as well.
[02:22:12.010 --> 02:22:14.010]  Or nah.
[02:22:14.010 --> 02:22:16.010]  You guys get some good hash.
[02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:18.010]  Don't settle
[02:22:18.010 --> 02:22:20.010]  for some crap. I know some of you guys just want to get high
[02:22:20.010 --> 02:22:22.010]  buzz don't settle for some boo boo.
[02:22:22.010 --> 02:22:24.010]  Smoke some good hash. Get some garden of weed and extracts.
[02:22:24.010 --> 02:22:26.010]  It should never crackle.
[02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:28.010]  That's the truth it should never crackle. Sometimes in the summer
[02:22:28.010 --> 02:22:30.010]  it'll crackle because your fucking crusty ass
[02:22:30.010 --> 02:22:32.010]  fingers put moisture in it but it should never crackle.
[02:22:32.010 --> 02:22:34.010]  It should never crackle unless if you
[02:22:34.010 --> 02:22:36.010]  fucking touch it and play with it.
[02:22:36.010 --> 02:22:38.010]  Like sometimes I do when I'm really high.
[02:22:38.010 --> 02:22:40.010]  Put your fingers all up in it.
[02:22:40.010 --> 02:22:42.010]  Making snakes out of your hash.
[02:22:42.010 --> 02:22:44.010]  Skrrt.
[02:22:44.010 --> 02:22:46.010]  Free Gucci.
[02:22:46.010 --> 02:22:48.010]  Squaw.
[02:22:48.010 --> 02:22:50.010]  Do I even? I was gonna ask a question
[02:22:50.010 --> 02:22:52.010]  but I don't even want to know the answer to my question.
[02:22:52.010 --> 02:22:54.010]  What? I don't even remember.
[02:22:54.010 --> 02:22:56.010]  I can't
[02:22:56.010 --> 02:22:58.010]  remember the other dudes name so I already
[02:22:58.010 --> 02:23:00.010]  forgot. I said it to myself one time and then
[02:23:00.010 --> 02:23:02.010]  it went away.
[02:23:02.010 --> 02:23:04.010]  Who's Drake beefing with?
[02:23:04.010 --> 02:23:06.010]  Meek. Meek? So you on team
[02:23:06.010 --> 02:23:08.010]  Drake or team Meek?
[02:23:08.010 --> 02:23:10.010]  I fuck with Drake.
[02:23:10.010 --> 02:23:12.010]  Honestly. Meek fucked
[02:23:12.010 --> 02:23:14.010]  it up. No new friends.
[02:23:14.010 --> 02:23:16.010]  I thought you guys were on team Waka Flocka.
[02:23:16.010 --> 02:23:18.010]  I fuck with Flocka the
[02:23:18.010 --> 02:23:20.010]  long way.
[02:23:22.010 --> 02:23:24.010]  But you asked who's Drake or Meek.
[02:23:24.010 --> 02:23:26.010]  Yeah. Alright.
[02:23:26.010 --> 02:23:28.010]  I just knew you'd know the answer because I definitely didn't know the answer.
[02:23:28.010 --> 02:23:30.010]  I want to see them box.
[02:23:30.010 --> 02:23:32.010]  You want to see them box?
[02:23:32.010 --> 02:23:34.010]  Do you think they should do it on pay per view?
[02:23:34.010 --> 02:23:36.010]  Nah. Cause they should do it in a back alley.
[02:23:36.010 --> 02:23:38.010]  Do it in a back alley?
[02:23:38.010 --> 02:23:40.010]  Do it on fucking world stars.
[02:23:40.010 --> 02:23:42.010]  World stars.
[02:23:42.010 --> 02:23:44.010]  For sure. World stars. I'm calling them out.
[02:23:44.010 --> 02:23:46.010]  World stars download.
[02:23:46.010 --> 02:23:48.010]  How much money you got on the side? What are you throwing down?
[02:23:48.010 --> 02:23:50.010]  A fight?
[02:23:50.010 --> 02:23:52.010]  Meek is what Drake says.
[02:23:52.010 --> 02:23:54.010]  You seen Drake lately though?
[02:23:54.010 --> 02:23:56.010]  Nah. He's swole.
[02:23:56.010 --> 02:23:58.010]  He been lifting.
[02:23:58.010 --> 02:24:00.010]  Is it Serena?
[02:24:00.010 --> 02:24:02.010]  Yeah. Serena. She like a minotaur.
[02:24:02.010 --> 02:24:04.010]  Wait. A tennis girl?
[02:24:04.010 --> 02:24:06.010]  You gotta prepare for that.
[02:24:06.010 --> 02:24:08.010]  No way. She's crushing
[02:24:08.010 --> 02:24:10.010]  him with them thighs.
[02:24:10.010 --> 02:24:12.010]  He's working on his lift.
[02:24:12.010 --> 02:24:14.010]  You remember
[02:24:14.010 --> 02:24:16.010]  Don't be a menace in the hood while drinking?
[02:24:16.010 --> 02:24:18.010]  Of course we do.
[02:24:18.010 --> 02:24:20.010]  You're not my friend if you don't know that.
[02:24:20.010 --> 02:24:22.010]  You know the part where
[02:24:22.010 --> 02:24:24.010]  the big Hulk girl is like
[02:24:24.010 --> 02:24:26.010]  That's Drake in there.
[02:24:26.010 --> 02:24:28.010]  Oh them edibles.
[02:24:28.010 --> 02:24:30.010]  Look what I just started.
[02:24:30.010 --> 02:24:32.010]  I like it. I'm proud of myself for that question.
[02:24:32.010 --> 02:24:34.010]  God damn. That worked out really well.
[02:24:34.010 --> 02:24:36.010]  We're looking for sponsors.
[02:24:36.010 --> 02:24:38.010]  We want to get that shit going on pay per view.
[02:24:38.010 --> 02:24:40.010]  If you want to throw it down.
[02:24:40.010 --> 02:24:42.010]  I'll host that shit. Honestly.
[02:24:42.010 --> 02:24:44.010]  For sure.
[02:24:44.010 --> 02:24:46.010]  If we got somewhere to fight.
[02:24:46.010 --> 02:24:48.010]  I'll be the host.
[02:24:48.010 --> 02:24:50.010]  We'll do it at the state fair convention center.
[02:24:50.010 --> 02:24:52.010]  Drake vs. Me.
[02:24:52.010 --> 02:24:54.010]  That'd be the most black people that have ever been in that building at one time I bet.
[02:24:54.010 --> 02:24:56.010]  In Pueblo at one time.
[02:24:58.010 --> 02:25:00.010]  Oh I saw a stat.
[02:25:00.010 --> 02:25:02.010]  Mike's trying hard not to laugh at that.
[02:25:02.010 --> 02:25:04.010]  Come on. It's funny bro. You can laugh.
[02:25:04.010 --> 02:25:06.010]  I saw the stats the other day about
[02:25:06.010 --> 02:25:08.010]  how many people moved to Colorado
[02:25:08.010 --> 02:25:10.010]  in the past year.
[02:25:10.010 --> 02:25:12.010]  Or from 2013 to 2014
[02:25:12.010 --> 02:25:14.010]  it was 200,000 people.
[02:25:14.010 --> 02:25:16.010]  That's how many people came here?
[02:25:16.010 --> 02:25:18.010]  Came from different states to Colorado.
[02:25:18.010 --> 02:25:20.010]  I'm one of those immigrants. Yeah. Welcome home.
[02:25:20.010 --> 02:25:22.010]  And they said like
[02:25:22.010 --> 02:25:24.010]  I want to say 5,000 people
[02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:26.010]  come to Denver
[02:25:26.010 --> 02:25:28.010]  that disperse
[02:25:28.010 --> 02:25:30.010]  through the state almost every month.
[02:25:30.010 --> 02:25:32.010]  Wow. Okay.
[02:25:32.010 --> 02:25:34.010]  So yeah I know a couple of people. Shout out George and Amanda.
[02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:36.010]  That's how Adam got here.
[02:25:36.010 --> 02:25:38.010]  I got a couple people.
[02:25:38.010 --> 02:25:40.010]  Yeah.
[02:25:40.010 --> 02:25:42.010]  Shout out to Team Whedon for bringing me here.
[02:25:42.010 --> 02:25:44.010]  They brought half of North Carolina.
[02:25:44.010 --> 02:25:46.010]  There's a town in North Carolina that's just a fucking ghost town now.
[02:25:46.010 --> 02:25:48.010]  Everybody's here.
[02:25:48.010 --> 02:25:50.010]  It's so funny now
[02:25:50.010 --> 02:25:52.010]  because people that live in North Carolina
[02:25:52.010 --> 02:25:54.010]  that were like
[02:25:54.010 --> 02:25:56.010]  I might move to Colorado.
[02:25:56.010 --> 02:25:58.010]  It's like where are you moving to?
[02:25:58.010 --> 02:26:00.010]  I'm thinking about moving to Puebs dog.
[02:26:00.010 --> 02:26:02.010]  It's full bro.
[02:26:02.010 --> 02:26:04.010]  We're getting so full.
[02:26:04.010 --> 02:26:06.010]  I'm going to stay around Durham for a little bit.
[02:26:06.010 --> 02:26:08.010]  But you should be giving more money to businesses.
[02:26:08.010 --> 02:26:10.010]  That's true.
[02:26:10.010 --> 02:26:12.010]  I truly believe that.
[02:26:12.010 --> 02:26:14.010]  I think that's something that Pueblo needs.
[02:26:14.010 --> 02:26:16.010]  In 10 years Pueblo will be as big as the Springs.
[02:26:16.010 --> 02:26:18.010]  Oh yeah. They'll touch pretty soon.
[02:26:18.010 --> 02:26:20.010]  Yeah pretty soon they'll be like
[02:26:20.010 --> 02:26:22.010]  it ain't going to be I-5 anymore.
[02:26:22.010 --> 02:26:24.010]  Do you think people can still move here from other states
[02:26:24.010 --> 02:26:26.010]  and set up a grove and start banging like they used to
[02:26:26.010 --> 02:26:28.010]  or is the regulation and is the market kind of shut?
[02:26:28.010 --> 02:26:30.010]  I think that
[02:26:30.010 --> 02:26:32.010]  is on the down.
[02:26:32.010 --> 02:26:34.010]  It sounds like it's coming down but I still think there's people
[02:26:34.010 --> 02:26:36.010]  that are moving here getting badges, getting jobs
[02:26:36.010 --> 02:26:38.010]  in the industry and that's all they need.
[02:26:38.010 --> 02:26:40.010]  You just want to be out of the state
[02:26:40.010 --> 02:26:42.010]  and move somewhere different.
[02:26:42.010 --> 02:26:44.010]  People just want to start a new life
[02:26:44.010 --> 02:26:46.010]  and it's amazing to do that in a state
[02:26:46.010 --> 02:26:48.010]  that has recreational marijuana
[02:26:48.010 --> 02:26:50.010]  because there's no fear for them.
[02:26:50.010 --> 02:26:52.010]  People love to move here from North Carolina.
[02:26:52.010 --> 02:26:54.010]  They're moving here from everywhere.
[02:26:54.010 --> 02:26:56.010]  If you're coming to Colorado, if you're coming here
[02:26:56.010 --> 02:26:58.010]  if you're showing up here, come get a badge.
[02:26:58.010 --> 02:27:00.010]  Come get an MED badge.
[02:27:00.010 --> 02:27:02.010]  Don't try to do your
[02:27:02.010 --> 02:27:04.010]  grow your own in your basement. Grow your own but don't try to do
[02:27:04.010 --> 02:27:06.010]  a big fat commercial grow. Don't try to bust
[02:27:06.010 --> 02:27:08.010]  some shit out because you're going to get yourself in trouble.
[02:27:08.010 --> 02:27:10.010]  They're really cracking down on you here in Colorado.
[02:27:10.010 --> 02:27:12.010]  You're going to get yourself in trouble or you're going to fail
[02:27:12.010 --> 02:27:14.010]  and lose money because you think
[02:27:14.010 --> 02:27:16.010]  you can do it and the next thing you know
[02:27:16.010 --> 02:27:18.010]  come harvest time and you're pulling
[02:27:18.010 --> 02:27:20.010]  an ounce of plant and you're supposed to be pulling
[02:27:20.010 --> 02:27:22.010]  10 ounces.
[02:27:22.010 --> 02:27:24.010]  There's things that
[02:27:24.010 --> 02:27:26.010]  if you do your research you can definitely
[02:27:26.010 --> 02:27:28.010]  grow your own weed. There's nothing wrong
[02:27:28.010 --> 02:27:30.010]  with everybody growing their own weed in their house
[02:27:30.010 --> 02:27:32.010]  or in a tent or something like that
[02:27:32.010 --> 02:27:34.010]  but when it comes to thinking you can come
[02:27:34.010 --> 02:27:36.010]  I came
[02:27:36.010 --> 02:27:38.010]  two years ago and I was late.
[02:27:38.010 --> 02:27:40.010]  There's people in the
[02:27:40.010 --> 02:27:42.010]  mountains that have 60
[02:27:42.010 --> 02:27:44.010]  K garages and that's
[02:27:44.010 --> 02:27:46.010]  what they do. And everybody here has got a weed
[02:27:46.010 --> 02:27:48.010]  guy so if you think you're going to move here and have
[02:27:48.010 --> 02:27:50.010]  somebody to sell your weed to
[02:27:50.010 --> 02:27:52.010]  I bet you that person has 10 other people
[02:27:52.010 --> 02:27:54.010]  that they go and get weed from.
[02:27:54.010 --> 02:27:56.010]  How does the drought happen with all of this?
[02:27:56.010 --> 02:27:58.010]  Yeah oddly enough there is a drought here in Colorado
[02:27:58.010 --> 02:28:00.010]  right now for some reason. It's almost harvest time.
[02:28:00.010 --> 02:28:02.010]  People are chopping shit down right now. It's dropping.
[02:28:02.010 --> 02:28:04.010]  It's about time to go.
[02:28:04.010 --> 02:28:06.010]  The crop tober is upon us.
[02:28:06.010 --> 02:28:08.010]  Happy crop tober everybody. I hope you guys are sitting around
[02:28:08.010 --> 02:28:10.010]  right now trimming. I hope you're getting
[02:28:10.010 --> 02:28:12.010]  plenty of medicine in you while you're trimming.
[02:28:12.010 --> 02:28:14.010]  I hope you're smoking some scissor hash. That's Mike's
[02:28:14.010 --> 02:28:16.010]  favorite part. Make some fucking
[02:28:16.010 --> 02:28:18.010]  rosin out of that scissor hash. Press that
[02:28:18.010 --> 02:28:20.010]  shit. See what happens.
[02:28:20.010 --> 02:28:22.010]  Wait, trim bin?
[02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:24.010]  Wait, trim bins?
[02:28:24.010 --> 02:28:26.010]  Yeah. Do you ever use trim bins dog?
[02:28:26.010 --> 02:28:28.010]  Trim bins are off
[02:28:28.010 --> 02:28:30.010]  the fucking chain. You get a lot of resin in there?
[02:28:30.010 --> 02:28:32.010]  A lot of cure for that? Bro like
[02:28:32.010 --> 02:28:34.010]  so much. Shout out to
[02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:36.010]  trim bins. And if you like raw like I
[02:28:36.010 --> 02:28:38.010]  have like I probably got
[02:28:38.010 --> 02:28:40.010]  like right around an ounce
[02:28:40.010 --> 02:28:42.010]  of pretty good. It would melt but it's
[02:28:42.010 --> 02:28:44.010]  a little contaminated so you would raws
[02:28:44.010 --> 02:28:46.010]  and take it. I just ain't got around to doing it
[02:28:46.010 --> 02:28:48.010]  yet but it's still like extra.
[02:28:48.010 --> 02:28:50.010]  You know you pay
[02:28:50.010 --> 02:28:52.010]  50 bucks but I got a zipper
[02:28:52.010 --> 02:28:54.010]  you know trim bin key. Oh shit.
[02:28:54.010 --> 02:28:56.010]  That 50 bucks has been paid
[02:28:56.010 --> 02:28:58.010]  for. Yeah. So and then when you
[02:28:58.010 --> 02:29:00.010]  steal. And it's neat.
[02:29:00.010 --> 02:29:02.010]  Hers is too small. It's not big enough to juice.
[02:29:02.010 --> 02:29:04.010]  That's on
[02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:06.010]  purpose.
[02:29:06.010 --> 02:29:08.010]  It's okay. It's alright. We can go to bed
[02:29:08.010 --> 02:29:10.010]  Bathy Beyond. We'll get this thing. It's always weird
[02:29:10.010 --> 02:29:12.010]  when you come home and you see your hair straightener like
[02:29:12.010 --> 02:29:14.010]  in the kitchen and you're like
[02:29:14.010 --> 02:29:16.010]  what happened in here? We was making
[02:29:16.010 --> 02:29:18.010]  rosin girl. It felt weird buying
[02:29:18.010 --> 02:29:20.010]  a hair straightener.
[02:29:20.010 --> 02:29:22.010]  I got dreadlocks. I didn't even try to go get one.
[02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:24.010]  Maybe it wasn't
[02:29:24.010 --> 02:29:26.010]  for me. Somebody make a meme out of that if you
[02:29:26.010 --> 02:29:28.010]  haven't already. Is this a birthday present
[02:29:28.010 --> 02:29:30.010]  sir? Do you need this gift wrap? I'm making
[02:29:30.010 --> 02:29:32.010]  drugs man. I love that when you
[02:29:32.010 --> 02:29:34.010]  go to Bed Bath and Beyond. That's the right store
[02:29:34.010 --> 02:29:36.010]  right? Yeah. They got the dab torch
[02:29:36.010 --> 02:29:38.010]  right there. They got the baking mat right there.
[02:29:38.010 --> 02:29:40.010]  The sleek pads. Yeah.
[02:29:40.010 --> 02:29:42.010]  They got everything. They know exactly. Parchment
[02:29:42.010 --> 02:29:44.010]  papers. It's all in the same area. They know exactly
[02:29:44.010 --> 02:29:46.010]  what's going on or they've done. They've got a computer
[02:29:46.010 --> 02:29:48.010]  that tells them what's happening.
[02:29:48.010 --> 02:29:50.010]  We've sold one million torches this year.
[02:29:50.010 --> 02:29:52.010]  People that bought the torch
[02:29:52.010 --> 02:29:54.010]  also bought this baking mat.
[02:29:54.010 --> 02:29:56.010]  People that bought this baking mat also bought
[02:29:56.010 --> 02:29:58.010]  this. Yeah. That's how they do it in a computer.
[02:29:58.010 --> 02:30:00.010]  They put them next to each other. Spence you look exhausted
[02:30:00.010 --> 02:30:02.010]  bro. Damn that was inspiring.
[02:30:02.010 --> 02:30:04.010]  He just stretched and grew an inch.
[02:30:06.010 --> 02:30:08.010]  You still up bro?
[02:30:08.010 --> 02:30:10.010]  You just took like a brief nap.
[02:30:10.010 --> 02:30:12.010]  Alright.
[02:30:12.010 --> 02:30:14.010]  I mean it's time to go you guys.
[02:30:14.010 --> 02:30:16.010]  This was episode number 100. I want to thank you guys for
[02:30:16.010 --> 02:30:18.010]  joining us. Holy shit this was a lot of fun.
[02:30:18.010 --> 02:30:20.010]  Thanks to Spence for coming. Thanks to Maddie for coming.
[02:30:20.010 --> 02:30:22.010]  Thanks to Mike for coming. Thanks to Slaught for showing up.
[02:30:22.010 --> 02:30:24.010]  Thanks to Joe for showing up. Thanks for coming you guys.
[02:30:24.010 --> 02:30:26.010]  Thanks for getting dabbed the fuck out. Thank you for having a podcast
[02:30:26.010 --> 02:30:28.010]  that we hit 100 episodes on.
[02:30:28.010 --> 02:30:30.010]  Good job bro. This was fun. Thanks a lot man.
[02:30:30.010 --> 02:30:32.010]  This was a lot of fun. I hope everybody made it through this.
[02:30:32.010 --> 02:30:34.010]  I'm like slouched over in my chair.
[02:30:34.010 --> 02:30:36.010]  I hope everyone listening to this got as
[02:30:36.010 --> 02:30:38.010]  high as we did. I hope you guys are wrecked
[02:30:38.010 --> 02:30:40.010]  right now. I hope somebody's melting into a chair. You guys I ate
[02:30:40.010 --> 02:30:42.010]  120 milligrams. It's been
[02:30:42.010 --> 02:30:44.010]  recording for an hour and 11 minutes.
[02:30:44.010 --> 02:30:46.010]  That means about an hour ago I probably ate that shit
[02:30:46.010 --> 02:30:48.010]  ish. I think I'm going to live. You're going to have a good
[02:30:48.010 --> 02:30:50.010]  rest of the night. Yeah.
[02:30:50.010 --> 02:30:52.010]  There's definitely food and cartoons
[02:30:52.010 --> 02:30:54.010]  in my future. At Chipotle.
[02:30:54.010 --> 02:30:56.010]  Um yeah.
[02:30:56.010 --> 02:30:58.010]  There might be a long ass line at Chipotle
[02:30:58.010 --> 02:31:00.010]  in a minute. There could be at all of us.
[02:31:00.010 --> 02:31:02.010]  Stoned ass bastards at Chipotle here
[02:31:02.010 --> 02:31:04.010]  in just a couple of minutes. So shout out to Chipotle.
[02:31:04.010 --> 02:31:06.010]  Shout out to everybody's bathroom later.
[02:31:06.010 --> 02:31:08.010]  Um.
[02:31:08.010 --> 02:31:10.010]  Uh let's see. How much of this
[02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:12.010]  do I want to do? I want to thank you guys for listening. Dude
[02:31:12.010 --> 02:31:14.010]  I'll be back. Apparently there's some news
[02:31:14.010 --> 02:31:16.010]  that we got to talk about. So I'll be back with episode number
[02:31:16.010 --> 02:31:18.010]  101. It'll be a news episode.
[02:31:18.010 --> 02:31:20.010]  Um I'm not going to read all this extra stuff.
[02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:22.010]  Go leave us a five star rating on iTunes.
[02:31:22.010 --> 02:31:24.010]  Go to the iTunes store. Search for

[02:32:04.010 --> 02:33:23.060]  Woo!
[02:33:23.060 --> 02:35:58.650]  Yeah.
[02:35:58.650 --> 02:36:00.650]  Welcome back Cannabis Community.
[02:36:00.650 --> 02:36:02.650]  It's time for episode number 101
[02:36:02.650 --> 02:36:04.650]  of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[02:36:04.650 --> 02:36:06.650]  Your source for cannabis news, education
[02:36:06.650 --> 02:36:08.650]  and conversation. That's right.
[02:36:08.650 --> 02:36:10.650]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[02:36:10.650 --> 02:36:12.650]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[02:36:12.650 --> 02:36:14.650]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[02:36:14.650 --> 02:36:16.650]  who is just curious about the current state of
[02:36:16.650 --> 02:36:18.650]  cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[02:36:18.650 --> 02:36:20.650]  for you. I'm your host. My friends
[02:36:20.650 --> 02:36:22.650]  call me Rost and Jeff. I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[02:36:22.650 --> 02:36:24.650]  I'm coming to you on a beautiful Friday afternoon.
[02:36:24.650 --> 02:36:26.650]  It is a gorgeous Friday. I hope everybody's having
[02:36:26.650 --> 02:36:28.650]  a wonderful day. No matter what you're doing,
[02:36:28.650 --> 02:36:30.650]  I hope you're smoking something delicious. I hope you're taking a fat
[02:36:30.650 --> 02:36:32.650]  dab. I hope you're eating some edibles. I hope you got a
[02:36:32.650 --> 02:36:34.650]  fat joint rolled up. I hope you got a tasty bowl
[02:36:34.650 --> 02:36:36.650]  packed. I hope you got a vape loaded.
[02:36:36.650 --> 02:36:38.650]  However you do it, I hope you are consuming some
[02:36:38.650 --> 02:36:40.650]  cannabis with me. You guys, it is Friday.
[02:36:40.650 --> 02:36:42.650]  It's just after 420. I'm slightly
[02:36:42.650 --> 02:36:44.650]  dabbed out. It's been a beautiful day.
[02:36:44.650 --> 02:36:46.650]  Last night was an amazing night. I got to
[02:36:46.650 --> 02:36:48.650]  see the legendary reggae band
[02:36:48.650 --> 02:36:50.650]  Israel Vibration in Denver
[02:36:50.650 --> 02:36:52.650]  at the Ogden Theater.
[02:36:52.650 --> 02:36:54.650]  I've talked about it before. The Roots Radix
[02:36:54.650 --> 02:36:56.650]  was there. The Roots Radix is of course
[02:36:56.650 --> 02:36:58.650]  the backing band for Israel Vibration.
[02:36:58.650 --> 02:37:00.650]  They were solid. Israel Vibration
[02:37:00.650 --> 02:37:02.650]  was solid and on fire.
[02:37:02.650 --> 02:37:04.650]  Unfortunately, I feel like it's probably
[02:37:04.650 --> 02:37:06.650]  getting close to the end for that band.
[02:37:06.650 --> 02:37:08.650]  This might be one of their final tours.
[02:37:08.650 --> 02:37:10.650]  Just a little rant about Israel
[02:37:10.650 --> 02:37:12.650]  Vibration. Israel Vibration is a Jamaican reggae
[02:37:12.650 --> 02:37:14.650]  band that actually met in
[02:37:14.650 --> 02:37:16.650]  an orphanage for children
[02:37:16.650 --> 02:37:18.650]  with polio. There were three members of
[02:37:18.650 --> 02:37:20.650]  Israel Vibration. All three of them had polio.
[02:37:20.650 --> 02:37:22.650]  Several years ago, one member left the band
[02:37:22.650 --> 02:37:24.650]  and now there are only two dudes left.
[02:37:24.650 --> 02:37:26.650]  It is my opinion
[02:37:26.650 --> 02:37:28.650]  that one dude looks like he is done touring.
[02:37:28.650 --> 02:37:30.650]  The look on his face during the show just looks
[02:37:30.650 --> 02:37:32.650]  like he's struggling. The polio
[02:37:32.650 --> 02:37:34.650]  is getting to him. It's kicking his ass. The other guy
[02:37:34.650 --> 02:37:36.650]  looks like he's doing pretty good. He gets around quite well.
[02:37:36.650 --> 02:37:38.650]  The one guy looks like he may
[02:37:38.650 --> 02:37:40.650]  I don't think he wants to tour anymore.
[02:37:40.650 --> 02:37:42.650]  It looks like the other dude is dragging him out on tour.
[02:37:42.650 --> 02:37:44.650]  He's like, you can't be Israel Vibration without both of us
[02:37:44.650 --> 02:37:46.650]  so I need you to come with them. That's kind of
[02:37:46.650 --> 02:37:48.650]  what it looks like to me. I may actually
[02:37:48.650 --> 02:37:50.650]  catch Israel Vibration again tonight. It just kind of
[02:37:50.650 --> 02:37:52.650]  depends on how things go. After recording here, I'm going to see
[02:37:52.650 --> 02:37:54.650]  what time it is and see if I got anybody that wants to
[02:37:54.650 --> 02:37:56.650]  go with me. We may go see some reggae tonight.
[02:37:56.650 --> 02:37:58.650]  Anyway, shout out to Israel
[02:37:58.650 --> 02:38:00.650]  Vibration. Big shout out to the Roots Radix Band.
[02:38:00.650 --> 02:38:02.650]  I feel like I caught one of the final tours that
[02:38:02.650 --> 02:38:04.650]  these guys are going to do so I'm really excited about that.
[02:38:04.650 --> 02:38:06.650]  Of course, they did one of my favorite songs.
[02:38:06.650 --> 02:38:08.650]  They did Herb is the Healing.
[02:38:08.650 --> 02:38:10.650]  The encore, they did Red Eyes.
[02:38:10.650 --> 02:38:12.650]  A big shout out to the Ogden
[02:38:12.650 --> 02:38:14.650]  Theater for not kicking me out for smoking a
[02:38:14.650 --> 02:38:16.650]  whole bunch of weed in there. That was pretty cool.
[02:38:16.650 --> 02:38:18.650]  I got one security guard gave me the look of, hey,
[02:38:18.650 --> 02:38:20.650]  chill out on the smoking. That was pretty much all they did.
[02:38:20.650 --> 02:38:22.650]  They didn't care. They didn't take my shit from me.
[02:38:22.650 --> 02:38:24.650]  They didn't kick me out. Much respect. Much
[02:38:24.650 --> 02:38:26.650]  love to the Ogden Theater and Israel Vibration.
[02:38:26.650 --> 02:38:28.650]  You guys,
[02:38:28.650 --> 02:38:30.650]  before I get too far, let's do some shout outs
[02:38:30.650 --> 02:38:32.650]  and give some thanks. Of course, I need to give thanks
[02:38:32.650 --> 02:38:34.650]  and a big shout out to the Mystic Roots
[02:38:34.650 --> 02:38:36.650]  Band. Big shout out to the Mystic Roots Crew.
[02:38:36.650 --> 02:38:38.650]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot, everybody
[02:38:38.650 --> 02:38:40.650]  involved in the Mystic Roots Crew.
[02:38:40.650 --> 02:38:42.650]  The Stay Positive Productions, all of those kids.
[02:38:42.650 --> 02:38:44.650]  Everybody, I got mad love for you. I got much
[02:38:44.650 --> 02:38:46.650]  respect for you. Make sure you guys check out the
[02:38:46.650 --> 02:38:48.650]  Mystic Roots Band. They let me play their music on
[02:38:48.650 --> 02:38:50.650]  the podcast. They don't ask for anything
[02:38:50.650 --> 02:38:52.650]  in return. I give them a shout out because they're my
[02:38:52.650 --> 02:38:54.650]  friends and I support them. They support positivity.
[02:38:54.650 --> 02:38:56.650]  They support reggae music. Support
[02:38:56.650 --> 02:38:58.650]  that shit. In my opinion,
[02:38:58.650 --> 02:39:00.650]  Catherine Ramirez is the most
[02:39:00.650 --> 02:39:02.650]  beautiful woman in reggae. So make sure you check out
[02:39:02.650 --> 02:39:04.650]  the Mystic Roots Band. Check out
[02:39:04.650 --> 02:39:06.650]  Miss Catherine Ramirez. Check out Coot Dog. Check out
[02:39:06.650 --> 02:39:08.650]  what they're doing. Good positive shit.
[02:39:08.650 --> 02:39:10.650]  Also, let's give some shout outs to
[02:39:10.650 --> 02:39:12.650]  everybody that showed up for episode number
[02:39:12.650 --> 02:39:14.650]  100. I want to give them a personal thank you.
[02:39:14.650 --> 02:39:16.650]  We had a hell of a good time. We may have got a little
[02:39:16.650 --> 02:39:18.650]  bit too high. I apologize if the show
[02:39:18.650 --> 02:39:20.650]  got off the rails a couple of times. That's just how
[02:39:20.650 --> 02:39:22.650]  it goes when everybody's here and we eat that many edibles
[02:39:22.650 --> 02:39:24.650]  and take that many dabs. But I do want
[02:39:24.650 --> 02:39:26.650]  to send a huge sincere thank you shout out to
[02:39:26.650 --> 02:39:28.650]  Spence and Maddie. Also Sloppy and
[02:39:28.650 --> 02:39:30.650]  Joe and also a huge shout out to Mike.
[02:39:30.650 --> 02:39:32.650]  Everybody took time out of their day to come here and be on
[02:39:32.650 --> 02:39:34.650]  a podcast. I appreciate it. That was super cool
[02:39:34.650 --> 02:39:36.650]  of them. Also, I want
[02:39:36.650 --> 02:39:38.650]  to give a huge shout out to a couple of brands and
[02:39:38.650 --> 02:39:40.650]  sponsors that I missed on episode 100.
[02:39:40.650 --> 02:39:42.650]  I was focused on having a good time. We
[02:39:42.650 --> 02:39:44.650]  did that, but I skipped one part. I needed
[02:39:44.650 --> 02:39:46.650]  to give a shout out to my good friends at Oil Slick.
[02:39:46.650 --> 02:39:48.650]  Shout out to everybody at
[02:39:48.650 --> 02:39:50.650]  Oil Slick. Those guys are cool as shit. Make sure you
[02:39:50.650 --> 02:39:52.650]  support Oil Slick. Also, shout out
[02:39:52.650 --> 02:39:54.650]  to a good friend Task Rock and
[02:39:54.650 --> 02:39:56.650]  highly educated Titanium.
[02:39:56.650 --> 02:39:58.650]  Task used to sponsor the show.
[02:39:58.650 --> 02:40:00.650]  Oil Slick used to sponsor the show.
[02:40:00.650 --> 02:40:02.650]  They're all still family. Shout out to those guys. Also,
[02:40:02.650 --> 02:40:04.650]  a big shout out to Dougie and the Hitman Glass
[02:40:04.650 --> 02:40:06.650]  crew. I wouldn't be dabbing the way
[02:40:06.650 --> 02:40:08.650]  I dab without Oil Slick.
[02:40:08.650 --> 02:40:10.650]  Highly educated and Hitman
[02:40:10.650 --> 02:40:12.650]  Glass. That's what keeps me dabbing the way that I do.
[02:40:12.650 --> 02:40:14.650]  Of course, big shout out to the Garden of Weeden.
[02:40:14.650 --> 02:40:16.650]  The Garden of Weeden keeps me well
[02:40:16.650 --> 02:40:18.650]  medicated. I like it.
[02:40:18.650 --> 02:40:20.650]  We got most of the shout outs covered. Let's see. Who else
[02:40:20.650 --> 02:40:22.650]  do I need to shout out? You know who I need to give the biggest,
[02:40:22.650 --> 02:40:24.650]  hugest thank you and shout out to?
[02:40:24.650 --> 02:40:26.650]  All of my listeners. Everybody
[02:40:26.650 --> 02:40:28.650]  that listens to this podcast, everybody that supports
[02:40:28.650 --> 02:40:30.650]  this show. This podcast wouldn't
[02:40:30.650 --> 02:40:32.650]  happen without you guys. I do it partly
[02:40:32.650 --> 02:40:34.650]  for me because I feel like I have to. It just comes out of me
[02:40:34.650 --> 02:40:36.650]  naturally. I would go crazy if I didn't do the podcast
[02:40:36.650 --> 02:40:38.650]  nowadays. I do it for you guys. This podcast
[02:40:38.650 --> 02:40:40.650]  is for you. This is my gift to you.
[02:40:40.650 --> 02:40:42.650]  I've been blessed with the ability to
[02:40:42.650 --> 02:40:44.650]  learn a whole bunch about cannabis. I've been blessed to be
[02:40:44.650 --> 02:40:46.650]  around people that love cannabis.
[02:40:46.650 --> 02:40:48.650]  I feel like I'm very privileged
[02:40:48.650 --> 02:40:50.650]  to be in this position, in this industry,
[02:40:50.650 --> 02:40:52.650]  in this state, in this time and age
[02:40:52.650 --> 02:40:54.650]  where I am. I feel like I'm really blessed.
[02:40:54.650 --> 02:40:56.650]  I'm lucky. It's a gift.
[02:40:56.650 --> 02:40:58.650]  I feel like I need to share it with you.
[02:40:58.650 --> 02:41:00.650]  This is for you. I want to thank all of you people
[02:41:00.650 --> 02:41:02.650]  for listening to the show. Everyone that
[02:41:02.650 --> 02:41:04.650]  subscribes, everybody that interacts
[02:41:04.650 --> 02:41:06.650]  with me on social media, thank you guys.
[02:41:06.650 --> 02:41:08.650]  Thank each and every one of you. Personally, I'm
[02:41:08.650 --> 02:41:10.650]  giving all of you a fist bump. This is to the microphone,
[02:41:10.650 --> 02:41:12.650]  fist bump right here. You heard
[02:41:12.650 --> 02:41:14.650]  that? That was a fist bump on the mic. That's for each
[02:41:14.650 --> 02:41:16.650]  and every one of you. Much respect, much love
[02:41:16.650 --> 02:41:18.650]  to everybody who supports the show. Also,
[02:41:18.650 --> 02:41:20.650]  an extra special shout out to
[02:41:20.650 --> 02:41:22.650]  everybody who watches me on Periscope.
[02:41:22.650 --> 02:41:24.650]  You guys, I've got a nice little following on Periscope.
[02:41:24.650 --> 02:41:26.650]  It's great jumping on and seeing all my
[02:41:26.650 --> 02:41:28.650]  crew on there. Thank you to everybody that jumps
[02:41:28.650 --> 02:41:30.650]  on. I love it. I love it. I love it.
[02:41:30.650 --> 02:41:32.650]  All right, you guys. I think
[02:41:32.650 --> 02:41:34.650]  that's enough shout outs. I think that's enough ass
[02:41:34.650 --> 02:41:36.650]  kissing for one episode. Let's get into some
[02:41:36.650 --> 02:41:38.650]  business here. On the last
[02:41:38.650 --> 02:41:40.650]  episode, we talked about some more
[02:41:40.650 --> 02:41:42.650]  issues with pesticides
[02:41:42.650 --> 02:41:44.650]  at a dispensary. I'm pulling up the article right
[02:41:44.650 --> 02:41:46.650]  now. This article
[02:41:46.650 --> 02:41:48.650]  comes from The Cannabis. This one
[02:41:48.650 --> 02:41:50.650]  of course is written by David McCoya.
[02:41:50.650 --> 02:41:52.650]  Sorry, David McGoya and
[02:41:52.650 --> 02:41:54.650]  Ricardo Baca. I tried to make that all into one
[02:41:54.650 --> 02:41:56.650]  name there. From the Denver Post and
[02:41:56.650 --> 02:41:58.650]  of course, The Cannabis. The headline
[02:41:58.650 --> 02:42:00.650]  says, Nature's Cure of Denver recalls pot
[02:42:00.650 --> 02:42:02.650]  products containing pesticides.
[02:42:02.650 --> 02:42:04.650]  Let's get right into the article. It says
[02:42:04.650 --> 02:42:06.650]  a second marijuana business in Denver in just
[02:42:06.650 --> 02:42:08.650]  over a week has voluntarily recalled
[02:42:08.650 --> 02:42:10.650]  its products because they contain a pesticide
[02:42:10.650 --> 02:42:12.650]  not allowed for use on
[02:42:12.650 --> 02:42:14.650]  cannabis. Denver health officials
[02:42:14.650 --> 02:42:16.650]  announced the recall by Nature's Cure,
[02:42:16.650 --> 02:42:18.650]  which also is known as Colfax Pot Shop
[02:42:18.650 --> 02:42:20.650]  Wednesday after tests found high levels of
[02:42:20.650 --> 02:42:22.650]  a pesticide that cannot be legally
[02:42:22.650 --> 02:42:24.650]  used to grow the crop.
[02:42:24.650 --> 02:42:26.650]  The recall extends to all of the company's
[02:42:26.650 --> 02:42:28.650]  plant material as well as its concentrates
[02:42:28.650 --> 02:42:30.650]  before October 6th, according
[02:42:30.650 --> 02:42:32.650]  to the Denver Department of Environmental Health.
[02:42:32.650 --> 02:42:34.650]  The business has one retail
[02:42:34.650 --> 02:42:36.650]  location at 1500 East Colfax.
[02:42:36.650 --> 02:42:38.650]  The pesticide,
[02:42:38.650 --> 02:42:40.650]  Spiromethicin, was detected during follow-up
[02:42:40.650 --> 02:42:42.650]  tests at Colfax Pot Shop after inspectors
[02:42:42.650 --> 02:42:44.650]  found pesticides in cannabis the shop
[02:42:44.650 --> 02:42:46.650]  had grown and sent to a facility for processing
[02:42:46.650 --> 02:42:48.650]  into various forms of marijuana
[02:42:48.650 --> 02:42:50.650]  infused products.
[02:42:50.650 --> 02:42:52.650]  That facility, Mahama,
[02:42:52.650 --> 02:42:54.650]  has also been the source of its own recall
[02:42:54.650 --> 02:42:56.650]  over pesticide concerns.
[02:42:56.650 --> 02:42:58.650]  An employee who answered the phone at Nature's Cure
[02:42:58.650 --> 02:43:00.650]  said its owners did not have a comment.
[02:43:00.650 --> 02:43:02.650]  The recalled products include dried medical
[02:43:02.650 --> 02:43:04.650]  marijuana with cultivation facility number
[02:43:04.650 --> 02:43:06.650]  403-00651
[02:43:06.650 --> 02:43:08.650]  on the label,
[02:43:08.650 --> 02:43:10.650]  dried recreational marijuana with the number
[02:43:10.650 --> 02:43:12.650]  403R-00035
[02:43:12.650 --> 02:43:14.650]  on the label,
[02:43:14.650 --> 02:43:16.650]  and concentrates from The Lab,
[02:43:16.650 --> 02:43:18.650]  Craft 710,
[02:43:18.650 --> 02:43:20.650]  TC Labs, Lab 710, or Mahama
[02:43:20.650 --> 02:43:22.650]  showing either number
[02:43:22.650 --> 02:43:24.650]  on their label.
[02:43:24.650 --> 02:43:26.650]  If you have dried marijuana,
[02:43:26.650 --> 02:43:28.650]  if you bought cannabis,
[02:43:28.650 --> 02:43:30.650]  that's pot, flowers, if you bought
[02:43:30.650 --> 02:43:32.650]  dried marijuana and the
[02:43:32.650 --> 02:43:34.650]  cultivation facility number on the label
[02:43:34.650 --> 02:43:36.650]  is 403-00651,
[02:43:36.650 --> 02:43:38.650]  take it back.
[02:43:38.650 --> 02:43:40.650]  If you bought dried
[02:43:40.650 --> 02:43:42.650]  recreational marijuana with
[02:43:42.650 --> 02:43:44.650]  the number 403R-00035
[02:43:44.650 --> 02:43:46.650]  on the label,
[02:43:46.650 --> 02:43:48.650]  take that
[02:43:48.650 --> 02:43:50.650]  shit back.
[02:43:50.650 --> 02:43:52.650]  And concentrates from The Lab,
[02:43:52.650 --> 02:43:54.650]  Craft 710, TC Labs,
[02:43:54.650 --> 02:43:56.650]  Lab 710, or Mahama
[02:43:56.650 --> 02:43:58.650]  showing either one of those
[02:43:58.650 --> 02:44:00.650]  numbers on their labels.
[02:44:00.650 --> 02:44:02.650]  Take those products back to where you purchased
[02:44:02.650 --> 02:44:04.650]  them and either ask for an exchange
[02:44:04.650 --> 02:44:06.650]  for something without pesticides in it,
[02:44:06.650 --> 02:44:08.650]  or get your damn money back.
[02:44:08.650 --> 02:44:10.650]  I do not know the return policy on any dispensary.
[02:44:10.650 --> 02:44:12.650]  They may not give you back your money,
[02:44:12.650 --> 02:44:14.650]  they may give you a store credit for a product,
[02:44:14.650 --> 02:44:16.650]  but whatever you do, go exchange it.
[02:44:16.650 --> 02:44:18.650]  You do not want to smoke this pesticide.
[02:44:18.650 --> 02:44:20.650]  Consumers are urged to destroy the
[02:44:20.650 --> 02:44:22.650]  product or return it to the place of purchase,
[02:44:22.650 --> 02:44:24.650]  is what the article says. It is the second
[02:44:24.650 --> 02:44:26.650]  business this month to issue a recall of its
[02:44:26.650 --> 02:44:28.650]  marijuana over concerns that potentially dangerous
[02:44:28.650 --> 02:44:30.650]  pesticides were used to cultivate the plants.
[02:44:30.650 --> 02:44:32.650]  The other, True Cannabis, issued
[02:44:32.650 --> 02:44:34.650]  a recall on October 13th after
[02:44:34.650 --> 02:44:36.650]  tests determined three disallowed pesticides
[02:44:36.650 --> 02:44:38.650]  were used to grow plants that were later
[02:44:38.650 --> 02:44:40.650]  processed into marijuana-infused products
[02:44:40.650 --> 02:44:42.650]  or MIPs.
[02:44:42.650 --> 02:44:44.650]  As with Colfax Pot Shop, plants
[02:44:44.650 --> 02:44:46.650]  grown by True Cannabis and sent to Mahama for
[02:44:46.650 --> 02:44:48.650]  processing were found to contain the pesticides,
[02:44:48.650 --> 02:44:50.650]  the health official said.
[02:44:50.650 --> 02:44:52.650]  There have been no reports of illness associated with any of these
[02:44:52.650 --> 02:44:54.650]  recalls. You guys, in my opinion,
[02:44:54.650 --> 02:44:56.650]  it's going to take a long time
[02:44:56.650 --> 02:44:58.650]  for health effects to be noticeable
[02:44:58.650 --> 02:45:00.650]  from smoking a pesticide like this.
[02:45:00.650 --> 02:45:02.650]  I'm not a doctor, I'm not a scientist,
[02:45:02.650 --> 02:45:04.650]  but these are the kinds of things that you smoke
[02:45:04.650 --> 02:45:06.650]  them today and you don't notice it
[02:45:06.650 --> 02:45:08.650]  until you're 20 years down the road
[02:45:08.650 --> 02:45:10.650]  and you've got some fucked up tumor in your lung,
[02:45:10.650 --> 02:45:12.650]  you've got some weird cancer,
[02:45:12.650 --> 02:45:14.650]  you've got something in your mouth that grew from this pesticide
[02:45:14.650 --> 02:45:16.650]  that you smoked. Some of these
[02:45:16.650 --> 02:45:18.650]  things will not affect you. Some of
[02:45:18.650 --> 02:45:20.650]  these things will go into your body and affect your
[02:45:20.650 --> 02:45:22.650]  body in really crazy ways and
[02:45:22.650 --> 02:45:24.650]  they will affect future generations of
[02:45:24.650 --> 02:45:26.650]  your family.
[02:45:26.650 --> 02:45:28.650]  Be aware of what you're consuming, you guys.
[02:45:28.650 --> 02:45:30.650]  I don't think that
[02:45:30.650 --> 02:45:32.650]  people are going to start reporting these illnesses
[02:45:32.650 --> 02:45:34.650]  for a very long time. Maybe somebody did
[02:45:34.650 --> 02:45:36.650]  smoke something with a little too much pesticide on it
[02:45:36.650 --> 02:45:38.650]  and they got sick right away, but that's very uncommon.
[02:45:38.650 --> 02:45:40.650]  These plants have been through the drying and curing
[02:45:40.650 --> 02:45:42.650]  phase, they've been trimmed,
[02:45:42.650 --> 02:45:44.650]  you can't see, smell, or feel
[02:45:44.650 --> 02:45:46.650]  this shit on there. It's got to be lab tested to find it.
[02:45:46.650 --> 02:45:48.650]  I'll continue with the article.
[02:45:48.650 --> 02:45:50.650]  MIPS often contain much higher concentrations
[02:45:50.650 --> 02:45:52.650]  of pesticides than dried plants processed
[02:45:52.650 --> 02:45:54.650]  for smoking because of the method used to extract
[02:45:54.650 --> 02:45:56.650]  THC and other cannabinoids from the plant.
[02:45:56.650 --> 02:45:58.650]  Also, pesticide levels
[02:45:58.650 --> 02:46:00.650]  dissipate quickly in dried marijuana
[02:46:00.650 --> 02:46:02.650]  while amounts found in MIPS typically
[02:46:02.650 --> 02:46:04.650]  do not. And you guys, that is extremely
[02:46:04.650 --> 02:46:06.650]  accurate. When you make hash,
[02:46:06.650 --> 02:46:08.650]  if you take a bud, a plant,
[02:46:08.650 --> 02:46:10.650]  that has been sprayed with pesticides,
[02:46:10.650 --> 02:46:12.650]  and you make hash with it, sometimes
[02:46:12.650 --> 02:46:14.650]  we can see the pesticide
[02:46:14.650 --> 02:46:16.650]  floating on the top of the hash. We can see
[02:46:16.650 --> 02:46:18.650]  a little sheen sometimes, we can see this little
[02:46:18.650 --> 02:46:20.650]  greasy layer. Sometimes we'll make a batch
[02:46:20.650 --> 02:46:22.650]  of hash and let it finish, and then you can touch
[02:46:22.650 --> 02:46:24.650]  the top of it and you can feel on your
[02:46:24.650 --> 02:46:26.650]  fingers a little oily layer of
[02:46:26.650 --> 02:46:28.650]  neem oil or stylet
[02:46:28.650 --> 02:46:30.650]  oil, or whatever type of oily
[02:46:30.650 --> 02:46:32.650]  product was applied to the plant. Botanical
[02:46:32.650 --> 02:46:34.650]  oils. Sometimes you can see that
[02:46:34.650 --> 02:46:36.650]  floating on top of the hash.
[02:46:36.650 --> 02:46:38.650]  It's hard to get out of there, you guys.
[02:46:38.650 --> 02:46:40.650]  It's going to make your hash taste like that, you're going to be consuming it.
[02:46:40.650 --> 02:46:42.650]  Stop spraying your
[02:46:42.650 --> 02:46:44.650]  plants with bullshit. That's, I think, the point
[02:46:44.650 --> 02:46:46.650]  here. Anyway, I will continue with the article
[02:46:46.650 --> 02:46:48.650]  because I feel like I've gotten myself off
[02:46:48.650 --> 02:46:50.650]  track. The recall is
[02:46:50.650 --> 02:46:52.650]  the fourth announced by the Denver Department of
[02:46:52.650 --> 02:46:54.650]  Environmental Health since it began cracking down
[02:46:54.650 --> 02:46:56.650]  on pesticides last spring, quarantining
[02:46:56.650 --> 02:46:58.650]  100,000 plants.
[02:46:58.650 --> 02:47:00.650]  The worries about pesticides and marijuana are the
[02:47:00.650 --> 02:47:02.650]  result of federal laws that deem the drug
[02:47:02.650 --> 02:47:04.650]  illegal, and as a result, safety
[02:47:04.650 --> 02:47:06.650]  tests have not been done on the chemicals
[02:47:06.650 --> 02:47:08.650]  when specifically ingested on
[02:47:08.650 --> 02:47:10.650]  marijuana. Marijuana can be
[02:47:10.650 --> 02:47:12.650]  classed as either food or a drug because
[02:47:12.650 --> 02:47:14.650]  of various ways it can be consumed.
[02:47:14.650 --> 02:47:16.650]  Federal law deems it a drug.
[02:47:16.650 --> 02:47:18.650]  State agriculture officials have proposed
[02:47:18.650 --> 02:47:20.650]  a rule that would limit the number of pesticides
[02:47:20.650 --> 02:47:22.650]  allowed for use in growing marijuana
[02:47:22.650 --> 02:47:24.650]  to about 75 of the least harmful.
[02:47:24.650 --> 02:47:26.650]  The rule would allow manufacturers
[02:47:26.650 --> 02:47:28.650]  of pesticides among the improved products
[02:47:28.650 --> 02:47:30.650]  to petition the government to let marijuana
[02:47:30.650 --> 02:47:32.650]  growers use its chemical.
[02:47:32.650 --> 02:47:34.650]  The company would have to first approve the
[02:47:34.650 --> 02:47:36.650]  pesticide as safe to humans and
[02:47:36.650 --> 02:47:38.650]  the environment. Currently, growers can
[02:47:38.650 --> 02:47:40.650]  use more than 200 pesticides the state
[02:47:40.650 --> 02:47:42.650]  says has warning labels so broad
[02:47:42.650 --> 02:47:44.650]  that using the product on cannabis would not
[02:47:44.650 --> 02:47:46.650]  violate federal laws that require chemicals
[02:47:46.650 --> 02:47:48.650]  to be used only as directed.
[02:47:48.650 --> 02:47:50.650]  You guys, when you open up any
[02:47:50.650 --> 02:47:52.650]  pesticide, there's that little, or when you buy the bottle,
[02:47:52.650 --> 02:47:54.650]  there's that little booklet attached to the back.
[02:47:54.650 --> 02:47:56.650]  All you have to do is pop that open and it unfolds
[02:47:56.650 --> 02:47:58.650]  and there are a bunch of rules and regulations
[02:47:58.650 --> 02:48:00.650]  in there. It tells you how you can
[02:48:00.650 --> 02:48:02.650]  apply that pesticide. It says what it can be
[02:48:02.650 --> 02:48:04.650]  used for. It says what type of crops it can be
[02:48:04.650 --> 02:48:06.650]  used on. It has got a
[02:48:06.650 --> 02:48:08.650]  window of re-entry listed
[02:48:08.650 --> 02:48:10.650]  on there. It will say if you spray this product,
[02:48:10.650 --> 02:48:12.650]  do not re-enter this room for up
[02:48:12.650 --> 02:48:14.650]  to four hours. Or if you do enter the
[02:48:14.650 --> 02:48:16.650]  room, be in proper equipment. Use a ventilator,
[02:48:16.650 --> 02:48:18.650]  use some type of covering.
[02:48:18.650 --> 02:48:20.650]  There will be a lot of things written on there.
[02:48:20.650 --> 02:48:22.650]  If you do not use that pesticide
[02:48:22.650 --> 02:48:24.650]  the way that that direction
[02:48:24.650 --> 02:48:26.650]  label says to use it, you are in
[02:48:26.650 --> 02:48:28.650]  violation of federal law.
[02:48:28.650 --> 02:48:30.650]  If a farmer in an agricultural
[02:48:30.650 --> 02:48:32.650]  business is caught using those
[02:48:32.650 --> 02:48:34.650]  pesticides improperly, he will be fined.
[02:48:34.650 --> 02:48:36.650]  He will face a federal law.
[02:48:36.650 --> 02:48:38.650]  His farm will face penalties.
[02:48:38.650 --> 02:48:40.650]  This is serious stuff.
[02:48:40.650 --> 02:48:42.650]  I did not realize how important this was and how serious
[02:48:42.650 --> 02:48:44.650]  this was until I had a little bit of training
[02:48:44.650 --> 02:48:46.650]  from the Colorado Department of Agriculture.
[02:48:46.650 --> 02:48:48.650]  So you guys, pay attention to those warnings.
[02:48:48.650 --> 02:48:50.650]  It is serious shit. You may not
[02:48:50.650 --> 02:48:52.650]  notice how much risk you are putting yourself
[02:48:52.650 --> 02:48:54.650]  in when you are using these pesticides.
[02:48:54.650 --> 02:48:56.650]  I recommend that you go and read about each
[02:48:56.650 --> 02:48:58.650]  pesticide that you are using. Read about each ingredient
[02:48:58.650 --> 02:49:00.650]  in there. Find out what it's derived from.
[02:49:00.650 --> 02:49:02.650]  Find out what it's going to do to you in small
[02:49:02.650 --> 02:49:04.650]  concentrations. Find out what it's going to do
[02:49:04.650 --> 02:49:06.650]  to you in large concentrations. Find out
[02:49:06.650 --> 02:49:08.650]  what you're exposing yourself to.
[02:49:08.650 --> 02:49:10.650]  Read about what you're putting on your medicine.
[02:49:10.650 --> 02:49:12.650]  You're spraying people's
[02:49:12.650 --> 02:49:14.650]  it may be recreational marijuana, it may
[02:49:14.650 --> 02:49:16.650]  be medical marijuana. Either way,
[02:49:16.650 --> 02:49:18.650]  find out what you're spraying on the stuff that you're giving
[02:49:18.650 --> 02:49:20.650]  to the people that you care about. If you're
[02:49:20.650 --> 02:49:22.650]  taking money for a product, if you're giving this product
[02:49:22.650 --> 02:49:24.650]  as a medical treatment, you need to
[02:49:24.650 --> 02:49:26.650]  take pride in it. It is your responsibility
[02:49:26.650 --> 02:49:28.650]  to make sure that no bullshit goes into your
[02:49:28.650 --> 02:49:30.650]  customers or your patients, your clients,
[02:49:30.650 --> 02:49:32.650]  whatever you want to call them, their lungs and
[02:49:32.650 --> 02:49:34.650]  bodies should be treated like a temple.
[02:49:34.650 --> 02:49:36.650]  It's your responsibility that their cannabis
[02:49:36.650 --> 02:49:38.650]  is clean and safe. That's your job
[02:49:38.650 --> 02:49:40.650]  as a grower. Read about all the
[02:49:40.650 --> 02:49:42.650]  pesticides. I'm going to continue and read the
[02:49:42.650 --> 02:49:44.650]  last line of the article. It says,
[02:49:44.650 --> 02:49:46.650]  despite the allowance, state officials have said
[02:49:46.650 --> 02:49:48.650]  they do not endorse the use of pesticides on
[02:49:48.650 --> 02:49:50.650]  marijuana because there is no data
[02:49:50.650 --> 02:49:52.650]  to ensure consumers are safe.
[02:49:52.650 --> 02:49:54.650]  It would be
[02:49:54.650 --> 02:49:56.650]  nice if we did not have to use any pesticides
[02:49:56.650 --> 02:49:58.650]  at all on growing cannabis, but it is
[02:49:58.650 --> 02:50:00.650]  very unrealistic.
[02:50:00.650 --> 02:50:02.650]  There are pests everywhere. We're building
[02:50:02.650 --> 02:50:04.650]  a new facility. Our grow facility
[02:50:04.650 --> 02:50:06.650]  is basically the desert. It's
[02:50:06.650 --> 02:50:08.650]  a rocky desert. It is in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[02:50:10.650 --> 02:50:12.650]  Outside of the facility, there are
[02:50:12.650 --> 02:50:14.650]  lizards, there are snakes, there are tarantulas,
[02:50:14.650 --> 02:50:16.650]  there are spiders,
[02:50:16.650 --> 02:50:18.650]  there are centipedes.
[02:50:18.650 --> 02:50:20.650]  We have built this facility from the
[02:50:20.650 --> 02:50:22.650]  ground up. It's a sealed facility and still
[02:50:22.650 --> 02:50:24.650]  occasionally, I will have to escort
[02:50:24.650 --> 02:50:26.650]  a baby tarantula out of the building
[02:50:26.650 --> 02:50:28.650]  or chase down a lizard out of the building.
[02:50:28.650 --> 02:50:30.650]  It's hard to keep shit
[02:50:30.650 --> 02:50:32.650]  out of buildings. Insects are much
[02:50:32.650 --> 02:50:34.650]  smaller than these tarantulas.
[02:50:34.650 --> 02:50:36.650]  Pot pests are much smaller
[02:50:36.650 --> 02:50:38.650]  than tarantulas and lizards. Keeping them
[02:50:38.650 --> 02:50:40.650]  out of there will sometimes require some
[02:50:40.650 --> 02:50:42.650]  sort of a pesticide. Of course, we're going to finish the building
[02:50:42.650 --> 02:50:44.650]  and we'll seal it up a little bit better.
[02:50:44.650 --> 02:50:46.650]  It's hard to keep shit out, is my point.
[02:50:46.650 --> 02:50:48.650]  We need some type of pesticide. We need some type
[02:50:48.650 --> 02:50:50.650]  of prevention. We need some type of
[02:50:50.650 --> 02:50:52.650]  integrated pest management system that
[02:50:52.650 --> 02:50:54.650]  will keep the bugs away. A lot of times
[02:50:54.650 --> 02:50:56.650]  that requires some sort of a bottled
[02:50:56.650 --> 02:50:58.650]  pesticide. If you're going to use it, you guys
[02:50:58.650 --> 02:51:00.650]  be responsible. Go to the Department of Agriculture,
[02:51:00.650 --> 02:51:02.650]  read about what you're using and learn
[02:51:02.650 --> 02:51:04.650]  what you are applying to your plants.
[02:51:04.650 --> 02:51:06.650]  I'm going to take a quick dab and a drink
[02:51:06.650 --> 02:51:08.650]  and then we will get on with the show.
[02:51:08.650 --> 02:51:10.650]  Excuse me for one quick second.
[02:51:10.650 --> 02:51:12.650]  Alright, you guys. I am nicely dabbed.
[02:51:12.650 --> 02:51:14.650]  I want to give a big shout out to my friend Maddie from
[02:51:14.650 --> 02:51:16.650]  the Garden of Weden. I took Maddie a bunch of
[02:51:16.650 --> 02:51:18.650]  Girl Scout cookies flowers that I grew
[02:51:18.650 --> 02:51:20.650]  and she turned it into some delicious
[02:51:20.650 --> 02:51:22.650]  oil for me.
[02:51:22.650 --> 02:51:24.650]  Some snap and peel.
[02:51:24.650 --> 02:51:26.650]  It almost shatters. It snaps a little more than it
[02:51:26.650 --> 02:51:28.650]  shatters. It's a little flexible. It's a little warm in here
[02:51:28.650 --> 02:51:30.650]  so that may have something to do with it.
[02:51:30.650 --> 02:51:32.650]  It is golden. It is beautiful. It smells
[02:51:32.650 --> 02:51:34.650]  amazing. It tastes delicious
[02:51:34.650 --> 02:51:36.650]  and it gets me high
[02:51:36.650 --> 02:51:38.650]  as shit. So a big shout out
[02:51:38.650 --> 02:51:40.650]  to Maddie for the amazing Girl Scout
[02:51:40.650 --> 02:51:42.650]  cookies hash. I appreciate it. Great work, girl.
[02:51:42.650 --> 02:51:44.650]  Nice job. I look forward to bringing you some
[02:51:44.650 --> 02:51:46.650]  more material to turn into hash
[02:51:46.650 --> 02:51:48.650]  for me.
[02:51:48.650 --> 02:51:50.650]  Alright, you guys. I've got another news article on the screen.
[02:51:50.650 --> 02:51:52.650]  This one comes from our neighbors to the north
[02:51:52.650 --> 02:51:54.650]  out of Canada. This article was sent to me by our
[02:51:54.650 --> 02:51:56.650]  good buddy Mike. What's up, Mike?
[02:51:56.650 --> 02:51:58.650]  Thanks for sending me some news. Sorry you couldn't join me tonight.
[02:51:58.650 --> 02:52:00.650]  Mike's hanging out with his lovely
[02:52:00.650 --> 02:52:02.650]  wife and their new baby. So big shout out to all
[02:52:02.650 --> 02:52:04.650]  of them. Big shout out to the Mike family.
[02:52:04.650 --> 02:52:06.650]  Hope everybody's doing well. Make sure you guys follow Mike on
[02:52:06.650 --> 02:52:08.650]  Twitter. It's at NemoPunk15.
[02:52:08.650 --> 02:52:10.650]  He posts a whole bunch of
[02:52:10.650 --> 02:52:12.650]  great cannabis news.
[02:52:12.650 --> 02:52:14.650]  Things that will educate you. Things you would
[02:52:14.650 --> 02:52:16.650]  appreciate seeing. So like I said,
[02:52:16.650 --> 02:52:18.650]  this article comes from our good friends in
[02:52:18.650 --> 02:52:20.650]  Canada. Shout out to Canada. Canada
[02:52:20.650 --> 02:52:22.650]  has elected a new Prime Minister
[02:52:22.650 --> 02:52:24.650]  who seems to be on our side. You guys,
[02:52:24.650 --> 02:52:26.650]  this article comes from Vice News. It was
[02:52:26.650 --> 02:52:28.650]  written by Rachel Brown. The headline says
[02:52:28.650 --> 02:52:30.650]  Trudeau held the best thing that's
[02:52:30.650 --> 02:52:32.650]  ever happened to Canadian weed.
[02:52:32.650 --> 02:52:34.650]  And the article goes like this.
[02:52:34.650 --> 02:52:36.650]  Justin Trudeau hasn't even
[02:52:36.650 --> 02:52:38.650]  been officially sworn in as Prime Minister yet.
[02:52:38.650 --> 02:52:40.650]  But as far as marijuana advocates are
[02:52:40.650 --> 02:52:42.650]  concerned, his promise to fully
[02:52:42.650 --> 02:52:44.650]  legalize it as
[02:52:44.650 --> 02:52:46.650]  good as fulfilled.
[02:52:46.650 --> 02:52:48.650]  Pot's Legal wrote Mark Emery, Canada's
[02:52:48.650 --> 02:52:50.650]  so-called Prince of Pot, the day after Trudeau
[02:52:50.650 --> 02:52:52.650]  and his Liberal Party won the federal election
[02:52:52.650 --> 02:52:54.650]  by a landslide. One of Mr. Trudeau's
[02:52:54.650 --> 02:52:56.650]  official declarations should be,
[02:52:56.650 --> 02:52:58.650]  the war against cannabis culture in Canada
[02:52:58.650 --> 02:53:00.650]  is over. By securing
[02:53:00.650 --> 02:53:02.650]  a majority government, the Liberals are poised
[02:53:02.650 --> 02:53:04.650]  to move quickly on their pledge to legalize,
[02:53:04.650 --> 02:53:06.650]  regulate, and restrict
[02:53:06.650 --> 02:53:08.650]  access to marijuana for
[02:53:08.650 --> 02:53:10.650]  recreational use, which Trudeau
[02:53:10.650 --> 02:53:12.650]  has billed as a top priority.
[02:53:12.650 --> 02:53:14.650]  Though the incoming Prime Minister
[02:53:14.650 --> 02:53:16.650]  has yet to specify what exactly
[02:53:16.650 --> 02:53:18.650]  legalizations would look like,
[02:53:18.650 --> 02:53:20.650]  and it could take years for it to come to fruition,
[02:53:20.650 --> 02:53:22.650]  things are already looking up for the industry.
[02:53:22.650 --> 02:53:24.650]  Because I'm stuttering in this article, so I'm going to
[02:53:24.650 --> 02:53:26.650]  reach over to my right, and I'm going to grab some of this
[02:53:26.650 --> 02:53:28.650]  Girl Scout Cookies dab.
[02:53:28.650 --> 02:53:30.650]  Reaching, reaching. The Girl Scout Cookies
[02:53:30.650 --> 02:53:32.650]  hash. Sorry, I don't even know what I'm saying. Grabbing
[02:53:32.650 --> 02:53:34.650]  some of this hash, unfolding the
[02:53:34.650 --> 02:53:36.650]  parchment, getting myself a big fat dab. Here we go.
[02:53:36.650 --> 02:53:38.650]  Getting a dab. And I'm
[02:53:38.650 --> 02:53:40.650]  going to grab the e-mail. I'm going to grab
[02:53:40.650 --> 02:53:42.650]  the rig that has the e-mail on it. That'll work a lot better
[02:53:42.650 --> 02:53:44.650]  for my fingers. I'm going to grab the little Hitman rig
[02:53:44.650 --> 02:53:46.650]  with the drop down from Elevate. It's got the
[02:53:46.650 --> 02:53:48.650]  highly educated D-nail attachment to it, which
[02:53:48.650 --> 02:53:50.650]  is running to the
[02:53:50.650 --> 02:53:52.650]  G-nail box by Emotech and Giddyup.
[02:53:52.650 --> 02:53:54.650]  So shout out to all the people that got me doing a fat dab
[02:53:54.650 --> 02:53:56.650]  right now. Let's do a dab, and let's
[02:53:56.650 --> 02:53:58.650]  cure my stutter problem on
[02:53:58.650 --> 02:54:00.650]  this podcast. Here we go.
[02:54:00.650 --> 02:54:02.650]  Aw, yeah. There we go.
[02:54:02.650 --> 02:54:10.400]  I'm carb capping and freestyle rapping.
[02:54:12.400 --> 02:54:14.400]  That's a little better.
[02:54:14.400 --> 02:54:16.400]  All right. I'm pretty sure I was reading an article.
[02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:18.400]  Now let's find where I was. Where was I?
[02:54:18.400 --> 02:54:20.400]  The morning after the election,
[02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:22.400]  stocks soared for three of the country's
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:24.400]  top medical marijuana producers.
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:26.400]  Some cannabis companies, Canada,
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:28.400]  began trading publicly last year
[02:54:28.400 --> 02:54:30.400]  after Health Canada started issuing licenses
[02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:32.400]  to companies for the country's estimated
[02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:34.400]  40,000 registered medical
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:36.400]  cannabis users. One study suggests
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:38.400]  there are 2.3 million marijuana
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:40.400]  users in Canada. That's an oddly
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:42.400]  worded statement there at the end of that
[02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:44.400]  paragraph. The current medical marijuana
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:46.400]  industry is believed to be worth
[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:48.400]  between $80 and $100 million.
[02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:50.400]  It's believed to be one of the best
[02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:52.400]  regulatory systems in the world and is
[02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:54.400]  highly regulated. Aaron Sals,
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:54:56.400]  an analyst with Dundee Capital Markets
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:54:58.400]  told the Financial Post
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:00.400]  that it could balloon to $5 billion
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:02.400]  if the market is fully legalized.
[02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:04.400]  It feels like they're missing a couple
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:06.400]  short words here, like thes and ands in some spots.
[02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:08.400]  It's weird. Anyway, the Canadian marijuana
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:10.400]  space could be set for another quarter of a billion
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:12.400]  Canadian marijuana space could be set for another
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:14.400]  revolution, Sals said. Bruce
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:16.400]  Linton, CEO of Tweed, the largest
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:18.400]  of Canada's 26 licensed
[02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:20.400]  cannabis producers, told Vice News
[02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:22.400]  in a previous interview that the medical marijuana
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:24.400]  industry can only benefit under
[02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:26.400]  a new legal regime, as it will
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:28.400]  likely facilitate the production for recreational
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:30.400]  marijuana similarly to
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:32.400]  the way things unfolded in
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:34.400]  Colorado. I would think that for licensed
[02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:36.400]  producers, which are large, regulated
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:38.400]  and under-controlled shipping and accounting
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:40.400]  procedures,
[02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:42.400]  which are large, regulated and under-controlled
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:44.400]  shipping and accounting procedures, would be the first
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:46.400]  choice for delivery because that's the first methodology
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:48.400]  to gain control of the supply chain,
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:50.400]  said Linton. Those running Vancouver's
[02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:52.400]  marijuana dispensaries, which operate in a
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:54.400]  legal grey zone because they sell
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:56.400]  marijuana without licenses from Health Canada,
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:55:58.400]  are looking forward to a fully legalized
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:00.400]  industry. Earlier this year,
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:02.400]  Health Canada threatened to send some RC,
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:04.400]  it's Royal Canadian, mounted police
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:06.400]  officers to shut them down.
[02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:08.400]  We're dancing in the streets, said
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:10.400]  Don Pereira, who owns a number of
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:12.400]  Vancouver dispensaries.
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:14.400]  This week, Jacobs
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:16.400]  Securities, a Toronto-based investment
[02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:18.400]  firm that specializes in advising
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:20.400]  companies on the cannabis sector,
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:22.400]  launched a $50 million cannabis fund
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:24.400]  to focus on opportunities in Canada
[02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:26.400]  and the U.S. Justin Trudeau
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:28.400]  getting elected is the best thing that's
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:30.400]  ever happened to the cannabis industry,
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:32.400]  Cheryl Schuman, founder of the Beverly Hills Cannabis
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:34.400]  Club and one of the fund's lead advisors,
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:36.400]  said in an interview with Vice News,
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:38.400]  within the last 72 hours,
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:40.400]  it's like open season in Canada and the
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:42.400]  opportunities to invest there keep growing and growing.
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:44.400]  It's like wildfire spreading.
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:46.400]  Speaking of Cheryl Schuman, I want
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:48.400]  to give a huge shout out to my buddy Mickey Martin. What up
[02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:50.400]  Mickey Martin? Shout out to Mickey Martin and
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:52.400]  Mickey Martin Consulting. That's
[02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:54.400]  what I'm saying. I'm going to keep going
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:56.400]  with the article here. If you guys know what I'm talking about,
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:56:58.400]  high five me mentally right now.
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:00.400]  The firm's other lead advisor is
[02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:02.400]  George Smitherman, Ontario's former health
[02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:04.400]  minister. Analysts have suggested
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:06.400]  that a fully legalized marijuana industry could
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:08.400]  attract investors from the alcohol and tobacco
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:10.400]  industries. Last month, addiction
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:12.400]  specialists wrote a piece in the Canadian Medical
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:14.400]  Association Journal urging whichever party
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:16.400]  forms government to move away
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:18.400]  from cannabis prohibition, but also
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:20.400]  retain control over the supply and sale
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:22.400]  of recreational marijuana should it become
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:24.400]  legalized. A frequently cited
[02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:26.400]  concern with legalization is that it will
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:28.400]  allow the rise of big cannabis,
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:30.400]  similar to big tobacco and big alcohol.
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:32.400]  These powerful multinational
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:34.400]  corporations have revenues and market
[02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:36.400]  expansion as their primary goals with
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:38.400]  little consideration of the impact
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:40.400]  on public health, the article states.
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:42.400]  You guys, that's something that we kind of overlooked
[02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:44.400]  here when we started writing
[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:46.400]  all of our marijuana laws in Colorado
[02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:48.400]  and California. We
[02:57:48.400 --> 02:57:50.400]  kind of forgot that big cannabis would take
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:52.400]  over and I see it
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:54.400]  happening. That's what's happening here
[02:57:54.400 --> 02:57:56.400]  in Colorado. If you don't have,
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:57:58.400]  there were tons of shops here that were mom
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:00.400]  pop shops, guys like myself with some dreadlocks
[02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:02.400]  and some growing skills would grow our
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:04.400]  hearts out, open up a shop and get
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:06.400]  shit going. But then all of the new regulations have
[02:58:06.400 --> 02:58:08.400]  pushed people in that realm
[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:10.400]  out because it is so expensive to open up a
[02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:12.400]  shop. It's so expensive to afford all of the security.
[02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:14.400]  It's so expensive to pay for all the licensing
[02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:16.400]  that only
[02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:18.400]  rich dudes that don't know anything about
[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:20.400]  cannabis can own dispensaries. Now,
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:22.400]  that is not 100% true, but that is a lot
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:24.400]  of what I saw happen. There are a lot of people that
[02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:26.400]  held on, a lot of people that persevered
[02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:28.400]  and made it in the industry, but
[02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:30.400]  very few of them survived. Big shout out
[02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:32.400]  to Scott Reach for making it. That dude
[02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:34.400]  made it from the beginning, killing it.
[02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:36.400]  Because if you want to be a cannabis entrepreneur,
[02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:38.400]  find out who Scott Reach is and read
[02:58:38.400 --> 02:58:40.400]  about that dude. Learn how that dude did it
[02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:42.400]  and you'll realize that you can do whatever
[02:58:42.400 --> 02:58:44.400]  the hell you want. I'm going to continue with the article.
[02:58:44.400 --> 02:58:46.400]  In August, Trudeau said his
[02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:48.400]  new government would look into pardoning Canadians
[02:58:48.400 --> 02:58:50.400]  serving time in prison for marijuana-related
[02:58:50.400 --> 02:58:52.400]  crimes after he repeals the laws
[02:58:52.400 --> 02:58:54.400]  in the criminal code. This dude's going to go
[02:58:54.400 --> 02:58:56.400]  and release Canadians
[02:58:56.400 --> 02:58:58.400]  serving time in prison for marijuana-related
[02:58:58.400 --> 02:59:00.400]  crimes. Their new prime minister is awesome,
[02:59:00.400 --> 02:59:02.400]  you guys. Could you imagine if we got a president like
[02:59:02.400 --> 02:59:04.400]  this in America? I mean, it's highly unlikely, but
[02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:06.400]  could you imagine if that shit happened? It would be so amazing
[02:59:06.400 --> 02:59:08.400]  if our president actually
[02:59:08.400 --> 02:59:10.400]  if our government
[02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:12.400]  actually governed us in a way that we
[02:59:12.400 --> 02:59:14.400]  found favorable instead of
[02:59:14.400 --> 02:59:16.400]  governing us in a way that we all feel like we're getting
[02:59:16.400 --> 02:59:18.400]  ripped the fuck off and it's only
[02:59:18.400 --> 02:59:20.400]  benefiting 1% of our nation.
[02:59:20.400 --> 02:59:22.400]  It'd be amazing if they actually felt some
[02:59:22.400 --> 02:59:24.400]  compassion for us, right? There's one more paragraph
[02:59:24.400 --> 02:59:26.400]  in this article, you guys. I will continue.
[02:59:26.400 --> 02:59:28.400]  There's been many situations over history
[02:59:28.400 --> 02:59:30.400]  when laws come in that overturn
[02:59:30.400 --> 02:59:32.400]  when laws come in that overturn
[02:59:32.400 --> 02:59:34.400]  previous convictions, he said
[02:59:34.400 --> 02:59:36.400]  at a campaign stop in Vancouver, and there
[02:59:36.400 --> 02:59:38.400]  will be a process for that that we
[02:59:38.400 --> 02:59:40.400]  will set up in a responsible way.
[02:59:40.400 --> 02:59:42.400]  You guys, also make sure you follow the lady
[02:59:42.400 --> 02:59:44.400]  that wrote this article. Her name is Rachel
[02:59:44.400 --> 02:59:46.400]  Brown. She's on Twitter at
[02:59:46.400 --> 02:59:48.400]  RP underscore Brown. Brown with an
[02:59:48.400 --> 02:59:50.400]  E at the end. So,
[02:59:50.400 --> 02:59:52.400]  Canada has
[02:59:52.400 --> 02:59:54.400]  basically legalized cannabis. This new
[02:59:54.400 --> 02:59:56.400]  Prime Minister Trudeau, Justin Trudeau
[02:59:56.400 --> 02:59:58.400]  I hope I'm saying that right.
[02:59:58.400 --> 03:00:00.400]  Justin Trudeau says that when he gets into office
[03:00:00.400 --> 03:00:02.400]  he's going to do what he can to make cannabis
[03:00:02.400 --> 03:00:04.400]  legal. You know, I heard him say
[03:00:04.400 --> 03:00:06.400]  I didn't hear him. He said in an article that I read
[03:00:06.400 --> 03:00:08.400]  that within 18 months
[03:00:08.400 --> 03:00:10.400]  of him taking office, he would
[03:00:10.400 --> 03:00:12.400]  legalize cannabis.
[03:00:12.400 --> 03:00:14.400]  I did some looking. I did some thinking.
[03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:16.400]  18 months after this dude takes office
[03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:18.400]  will be the middle
[03:00:18.400 --> 03:00:20.400]  of April. So, by 420
[03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:22.400]  in 2017
[03:00:22.400 --> 03:00:24.400]  is that when it'll be? 2016? 2017
[03:00:24.400 --> 03:00:26.400]  420, Canada
[03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:28.400]  will have legalized cannabis.
[03:00:28.400 --> 03:00:30.400]  If I did that math wrong, let me know. I don't
[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:32.400]  have a corrections department. That is you
[03:00:32.400 --> 03:00:34.400]  guys.
[03:00:34.400 --> 03:00:36.400]  Alright, you guys. That's all I've got for you this week.
[03:00:36.400 --> 03:00:38.400]  I'm working on the episode about CBD
[03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:40.400]  still. Mike and Doug came over and touched a little
[03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:42.400]  bit on that. I've got a lot more stuff
[03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:44.400]  to talk about CBD wise.
[03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:46.400]  I've got a whole bunch of great stuff planned for you.
[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:48.400]  I want to thank you guys for listening to another episode.
[03:00:48.400 --> 03:00:50.400]  I will be back in 7 days
[03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:52.400]  with episode number 102.
[03:00:52.400 --> 03:00:54.400]  You guys, if you're

[03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:14.400]  They can't take that down.
[03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:16.400]  That is mine.
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:18.400]  It will always be there forever for you guys to go
[03:02:18.400 --> 03:02:20.400]  back and listen all the way to episode number one
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:22.400]  when I barely knew what I was doing
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:24.400]  all the way up to number 101
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:26.400]  where we are today. Go back, listen to
[03:02:26.400 --> 03:02:28.400]  everyone, see the improvement, learn a whole bunch
[03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:30.400]  about cannabis. Email me
[03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:32.400]  or Twitter me and tell me
[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:34.400]  what your favorite episode is and
[03:02:34.400 --> 03:02:36.400]  what you've learned from the show. That would be great.
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:38.400]  You guys, don't forget that there is a donation
[03:02:38.400 --> 03:02:40.400]  button on the podcast page on the website.

[03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:36.400]  about some bullshit, but I would love it if you check
