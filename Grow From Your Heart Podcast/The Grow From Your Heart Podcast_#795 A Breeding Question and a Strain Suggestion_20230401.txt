[00:28.730 --> 00:30.090]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:30.090 --> 00:31.850]  I'm your host, Ross DeGeff.
[00:31.850 --> 00:35.890]  This is episode 795 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:35.890 --> 00:37.890]  I've got a fun show lined up for us.
[00:37.890 --> 00:40.130]  In this episode, I'm going to give away free seeds.
[00:40.130 --> 00:41.130]  That's right.
[00:41.130 --> 00:44.570]  I've teamed up with our friends at seedsherenow.com to give away free seeds.
[00:44.570 --> 00:47.290]  Of course, we'll be giving away some Irie Genetic seeds.
[00:47.290 --> 00:48.290]  Stay tuned.
[00:48.290 --> 00:51.290]  We'll talk about how you can win those seeds later here in this episode.
[00:51.290 --> 00:54.730]  Before we get too far, I do want to remind you that Irie Genetics will be at the Dude
[00:54.730 --> 00:55.730]  Grows Cup.
[00:55.730 --> 00:56.730]  That's right.
[00:56.730 --> 01:00.130]  The Dude Grows Cup is happening again this year, just outside of Fort Collins on June
[01:00.130 --> 01:01.130]  3rd.
[01:01.130 --> 01:04.490]  Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all of the information.
[01:04.490 --> 01:06.290]  I look forward to seeing you there.
[01:06.290 --> 01:11.730]  Also, don't miss the new sale, the fresh drop, and the restock on Irie Direct.
[01:11.730 --> 01:12.730]  That's right.
[01:12.730 --> 01:13.730]  There's bubble goat.
[01:13.730 --> 01:14.730]  There is grip tape.
[01:14.730 --> 01:18.210]  There's Big Mountain Fudge Cake available and a lot of other great stuff.
[01:18.210 --> 01:24.070]  Make sure you go check out iredirect.com for the sale pricing and the fresh drop.
[01:24.070 --> 01:27.810]  Make sure you stay on top of all of those drops by joining the newsletter on the Irie
[01:27.810 --> 01:28.810]  Direct website.
[01:28.810 --> 01:29.810]  That's right.
[01:29.810 --> 01:32.090]  Go to iredirect.com or iregenetics.com.
[01:32.090 --> 01:34.970]  Both of them will have the opportunity to join the newsletter.
[01:34.970 --> 01:36.290]  Scroll down to the bottom of the page.
[01:36.290 --> 01:38.650]  There's a little icon that looks like an envelope.
[01:38.650 --> 01:39.690]  Type in your email address.
[01:39.690 --> 01:41.470]  That will sign you up for the newsletter.
[01:41.470 --> 01:45.030]  When I put out new drops, when I put out new strains, when I put out sale pricing,
[01:45.030 --> 01:48.230]  you will get a notification via email from the newsletter.
[01:48.230 --> 01:49.990]  I try to keep everybody in the loop.
[01:49.990 --> 01:54.830]  Of course, Patreon does get the first heads up on new strains, new drops, and new releases.
[01:54.830 --> 02:00.550]  Make sure you check out patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart to join the Patreon.
[02:00.550 --> 02:03.190]  That is all of the business I've got for you here at the start of the show.
[02:03.190 --> 02:06.830]  I do have several wonderful emails that I would like to read.
[02:06.830 --> 02:10.270]  The first one was sent to me by a good friend.
[02:10.270 --> 02:14.310]  They asked me personally to read this on the podcast.
[02:14.310 --> 02:15.670]  This is what I do for my friends.
[02:15.670 --> 02:17.550]  Big shout out to my buddy Turkey.
[02:17.550 --> 02:21.590]  If I read your message on the podcast, that does mean that you win a free pack of seeds.
[02:21.590 --> 02:25.390]  Turkey, it looks like you have turkeyed yourself into a free pack of seeds.
[02:25.390 --> 02:26.390]  Please send me your address.
[02:26.390 --> 02:29.890]  It looks like I might need your address anyway according to this email.
[02:29.890 --> 02:31.670]  This one, my friends, goes a little bit like this.
[02:31.670 --> 02:36.030]  It says, Dear Rasta Jeff, I hope this letter finds you in good health.
[02:36.030 --> 02:37.030]  Feel good, bro.
[02:37.030 --> 02:38.030]  Thank you.
[02:38.030 --> 02:41.350]  It said I'm writing to you with a request that is both unusual and urgent.
[02:41.350 --> 02:44.190]  Well, I like to help out when I can.
[02:44.190 --> 02:45.190]  It goes on.
[02:45.190 --> 02:50.310]  It says, You see, I am in desperate need of a baby brother who can shred on the drums,
[02:50.310 --> 02:53.670]  and I have reason to believe that you are just the man for the job.
[02:53.670 --> 02:57.710]  Now, when I first read this, I thought this guy was calling me his new baby brother because
[02:57.710 --> 02:59.790]  I am a decent drummer.
[02:59.790 --> 03:01.230]  I can hold my own on a drum kit.
[03:01.230 --> 03:02.230]  I can rock it.
[03:02.230 --> 03:03.230]  I can get down.
[03:03.230 --> 03:05.070]  We can play some funk, some reggae, some blues.
[03:05.070 --> 03:08.990]  I can't change time signatures without warning me, but I can keep up and play some odd times.
[03:08.990 --> 03:10.750]  I can read and write music anyway.
[03:10.750 --> 03:14.490]  I thought this was going to be about me being the funky drummer baby brother.
[03:14.490 --> 03:15.930]  It goes on.
[03:15.930 --> 03:20.030]  It does say, Now, you may be wondering exactly how you can assist in this matter.
[03:20.030 --> 03:25.230]  Fear not, for I have a proposal that I believe you will find both intriguing and enticing.
[03:25.230 --> 03:27.390]  This is where it really gets weird, my friends.
[03:27.390 --> 03:31.690]  It says, My mother, who is a lovely and talented woman in her own right, has long harbored
[03:31.690 --> 03:35.770]  a desire to start a family with someone who shares her passion for music.
[03:35.770 --> 03:39.970]  And who better than you, Ross DeJeff, with your prodigious skills on the drums and an
[03:39.970 --> 03:43.330]  unmistakable love for all things rock and roll?
[03:43.330 --> 03:46.490]  This has taken a quick turn for the weirdest, but I'm going to keep reading.
[03:46.490 --> 03:47.650]  It says, Think about it.
[03:47.650 --> 03:52.210]  With your genes and my mother's musical prowess, we could create a child who is destined for
[03:52.210 --> 03:53.850]  greatness on the drum set.
[03:53.850 --> 03:58.670]  So our friend here would like to create a breeding project between myself and his mother
[03:58.910 --> 04:05.390]  so that we can F1 a baby brother for him with traits from his mother and myself.
[04:05.390 --> 04:06.430]  Hey, that's a great idea.
[04:06.430 --> 04:07.430]  That's a great project.
[04:07.430 --> 04:08.430]  I'm glad that you saw that.
[04:08.430 --> 04:10.350]  That's a good eye for breeding, my dude.
[04:10.350 --> 04:11.350]  It goes on, though.
[04:11.350 --> 04:12.590]  It says, So what do you say, Ross DeJeff?
[04:12.590 --> 04:17.230]  Will you help me fulfill my dream of having a baby brother who shreds on the drums?
[04:17.230 --> 04:21.710]  I promise that the rewards will be many, both in this life and the next.
[04:21.710 --> 04:24.030]  Sincerely, from Turkey.
[04:24.030 --> 04:25.790]  I apologize for giggling in the end there.
[04:25.790 --> 04:28.830]  I tried to hold it together for that whole message.
[04:28.830 --> 04:33.870]  My friend Turkey, there's a lot to commit to to this here.
[04:33.870 --> 04:35.510]  I don't know that I want to.
[04:35.510 --> 04:38.870]  I'm not sure that I can agree to this at this time, my friend.
[04:38.870 --> 04:41.710]  I'm going to have to politely decline the offer here.
[04:41.710 --> 04:46.550]  But that is not to say that you can't check back in the future.
[04:46.550 --> 04:47.550]  You know what I'm saying?
[04:47.550 --> 04:48.550]  Things may change.
[04:48.550 --> 04:49.550]  I may.
[04:49.550 --> 04:51.690]  There may be a software update that does change my opinion.
[04:51.690 --> 04:54.030]  So that's our first breeding question for today's episode.
[04:54.030 --> 04:55.990]  That one did come from my friend Turkey.
[04:55.990 --> 05:00.230]  I do feel I have not met your mother yet, but I do feel that I could pass on this drummer
[05:00.230 --> 05:01.990]  gene, this rock star vibe.
[05:01.990 --> 05:02.990]  That may be an option.
[05:02.990 --> 05:04.950]  I do have a daughter who is quite a rock star.
[05:04.950 --> 05:08.230]  All right, Turkey, thanks once again for the great breeding question.
[05:08.230 --> 05:12.390]  I'm sorry I'm not able to help you out at this time, maybe in the future.
[05:12.390 --> 05:13.950]  That's just a long commitment, my bro.
[05:13.950 --> 05:16.070]  I'm not sure that I want to commit to that whole thing.
[05:16.070 --> 05:17.270]  I don't want to have another child.
[05:17.270 --> 05:20.610]  I've already got one who's fucking awesome, which, by the way, I did pass on some amazing
[05:20.610 --> 05:23.110]  traits to that child.
[05:23.190 --> 05:24.190]  I don't want another one.
[05:24.190 --> 05:27.150]  I don't want 18 more years of doing that, and I don't want to teach somebody else how
[05:27.150 --> 05:28.990]  to play the drums right now.
[05:28.990 --> 05:31.830]  And politely, I'm going to have to decline, bro.
[05:31.830 --> 05:36.190]  But you know what I say, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me, bro.
[05:36.190 --> 05:39.590]  Do send me your address because you do get a free pack of seeds for that message, no
[05:39.590 --> 05:42.770]  matter how ludicrous and or entertaining that was.
[05:42.770 --> 05:43.770]  Let's keep the show moving.
[05:43.770 --> 05:46.930]  Let's actually jump into some truly cannabis-related content.
[05:46.930 --> 05:50.510]  Thank you guys for hanging out and listening to that funny message from my friend Turkey.
[05:50.510 --> 05:54.430]  This one came from the Grow Help tab on the iRegenetics website.
[05:54.430 --> 05:55.430]  That's right.
[05:55.430 --> 05:59.850]  If you go to iRegenetics.com, on the top, there's a row of tabs just like most websites.
[05:59.850 --> 06:00.850]  There's one you can click on.
[06:00.850 --> 06:01.850]  It says Questions.
[06:01.850 --> 06:05.310]  When you click on that, it will ask you a couple of short, like a couple of questions
[06:05.310 --> 06:06.310]  about your grow.
[06:06.310 --> 06:07.310]  What's the temp?
[06:07.310 --> 06:08.310]  What's the humidity?
[06:08.310 --> 06:11.150]  Then we do give you the opportunity to type in your grow questions that we can help you
[06:11.150 --> 06:12.150]  out.
[06:12.150 --> 06:14.990]  And of course, if you send a question to the Grow Help tab, and I do read that here on
[06:14.990 --> 06:18.770]  the show, you win a free pack of seeds, and that free pack of seeds is sponsored by our
[06:18.770 --> 06:21.290]  friends at seedsherenow.com.
[06:21.290 --> 06:23.870]  Big shout out to the whole crew at seedsherenow.com.
[06:23.870 --> 06:26.250]  Big extra fist bump to my buddy Lucas.
[06:26.250 --> 06:27.810]  Let's keep it moving.
[06:27.810 --> 06:31.410]  This message came from our friend who wants to be called Tommy Two Trikes.
[06:31.410 --> 06:33.210]  Big shout out to my buddy Tommy Two Trikes.
[06:33.210 --> 06:35.170]  Tommy, please do send me a message with your address.
[06:35.170 --> 06:37.690]  I'd be happy to get you out a pack of seeds.
[06:37.690 --> 06:39.690]  Let's read the question here on the show.
[06:39.690 --> 06:40.890]  It says, Yo, Rasta Jeff.
[06:40.890 --> 06:44.410]  I'm a medical home grower in the great state of Illinois.
[06:44.410 --> 06:46.210]  Big shout out to our friends out there in Illinois.
[06:46.210 --> 06:47.350]  The message does continue.
[06:47.390 --> 06:49.990]  It says, I'm looking for strange suggestions.
[06:49.990 --> 06:51.270]  You've come to the right place, my friend.
[06:51.270 --> 06:53.230]  It says, Here is my situation.
[06:53.230 --> 06:57.190]  I've got a two-year-old puppy who is suffering from terrible seizures.
[06:57.190 --> 07:01.390]  Right now, we're taking every medicine the vet can offer at the highest dose possible,
[07:01.390 --> 07:02.990]  yet the dog is still suffering.
[07:02.990 --> 07:03.990]  Man, I'm sorry.
[07:03.990 --> 07:05.470]  That is terrible.
[07:05.470 --> 07:07.550]  Seizures are heartbreaking to watch.
[07:07.550 --> 07:11.910]  Someone or something you care about is flopping around, and you can't do shit about it.
[07:11.910 --> 07:12.910]  It's heartbreaking.
[07:12.910 --> 07:13.910]  I've been there before.
[07:13.910 --> 07:14.910]  I know how you feel.
[07:14.910 --> 07:15.910]  That's got to be scary.
[07:15.910 --> 07:17.270]  I wish the best for you and your dog.
[07:17.310 --> 07:20.070]  I hope that we are able to help you out in some sort of way.
[07:20.070 --> 07:21.750]  Hope the cannabis community can help you out.
[07:21.750 --> 07:22.750]  It goes on.
[07:22.750 --> 07:26.870]  It says, I got my hands on some chronic CBD from Serious Seeds.
[07:26.870 --> 07:29.750]  I've grown it and made him some good boy treats.
[07:29.750 --> 07:31.550]  That's a super good dog dad of you.
[07:31.550 --> 07:35.950]  It says, Unfortunately, there's too much THC in this strain, and he gets way more stoned
[07:35.950 --> 07:39.430]  than I want and more stoned than he wants.
[07:39.430 --> 07:43.030]  Yeah, I've seen some dogs get too damn stoned.
[07:43.030 --> 07:44.030]  That's also heartbreaking.
[07:44.030 --> 07:47.250]  Sometimes, it's funny for about 10 minutes, but then you're like, Fuck, that dog's fucking
[07:47.250 --> 07:48.250]  suffering.
[07:48.250 --> 07:52.850]  Anyway, it says, Would you have a strain that may offer us some relief but not fuck this
[07:52.850 --> 07:53.850]  dog up?
[07:53.850 --> 07:55.250]  Yes, this is a very good question.
[07:55.250 --> 08:00.090]  I do need to jump in right now and say, for legal purposes, for safety purposes, that
[08:00.090 --> 08:02.290]  first of all, Rasta Jeff is a fictional character.
[08:02.290 --> 08:03.430]  That's not even my real name.
[08:03.430 --> 08:06.450]  But also, Rasta Jeff is not a veterinarian.
[08:06.450 --> 08:10.350]  I am not qualified to give you any real medical advice.
[08:10.350 --> 08:13.410]  If it's for a human, if it's for a dog, I am not a doctor.
[08:13.410 --> 08:14.530]  I'm not wearing a lab coat.
[08:14.530 --> 08:18.290]  I've got dreadlocks down to my calves by now, you guys.
[08:18.290 --> 08:19.290]  I'm 6'5".
[08:19.290 --> 08:20.290]  The dreads go to my calves.
[08:20.290 --> 08:21.290]  I've got dreads to my calves.
[08:21.290 --> 08:24.130]  I'm wearing a fucking Nike hoodie and some dunks over here.
[08:24.130 --> 08:28.810]  I'm not qualified to give true, solid medical advice or veterinarian advice.
[08:28.810 --> 08:33.490]  I've got to make that disclaimer just because people are fucking litigious these days, and
[08:33.490 --> 08:35.770]  I'm not trying to get sued for saying some silly shit.
[08:35.770 --> 08:36.810]  So I'm not a doctor.
[08:36.810 --> 08:39.410]  I'm not qualified to give medical advice.
[08:39.410 --> 08:44.130]  However, and also, I'm definitely not qualified, and people are going to have something to
[08:44.730 --> 08:47.370]  say if we start talking about giving your dog cannabis.
[08:47.370 --> 08:48.450]  Some people are against that.
[08:48.450 --> 08:49.450]  I am not against that.
[08:49.450 --> 08:52.490]  I think that cannabis is a healer if we do it properly, if the dog's into it.
[08:52.490 --> 08:55.570]  You guys know that one of the dogs I was around often loves to smoke.
[08:55.570 --> 08:59.210]  When I smoke, he comes and stands next to me and gets mad if I don't blow him some.
[08:59.210 --> 09:01.170]  But if the dog enjoys it, it's all good.
[09:01.170 --> 09:03.850]  But there's going to be activists on the other side saying that it's wrong to give your dog
[09:03.850 --> 09:05.210]  cannabis to help this out.
[09:05.210 --> 09:06.910]  But here's what I'm going to say.
[09:06.910 --> 09:11.250]  I'm not a veterinarian, but if this were ... I'm not a veterinarian or a doctor, but if this
[09:11.290 --> 09:16.250]  were one of my friends who were near me, I would offer them something more of a ... It
[09:16.250 --> 09:17.450]  sounds like what you grew.
[09:17.450 --> 09:18.650]  I don't know if you've lab tested it.
[09:18.650 --> 09:21.210]  We don't know how much THC to CBD is in there.
[09:21.210 --> 09:25.930]  I would find something that is just CBD that doesn't have any THC in it if possible and
[09:25.930 --> 09:27.530]  see if that helps with the seizures.
[09:27.530 --> 09:28.530]  That's where I would start.
[09:28.530 --> 09:30.170]  Something just CBD.
[09:30.170 --> 09:33.010]  You haven't lab tested your product, so we don't know the levels in there.
[09:33.010 --> 09:34.010]  Maybe you did.
[09:34.010 --> 09:35.370]  I don't know the levels in that product.
[09:35.370 --> 09:39.810]  What I would recommend is starting with something just CBD, but of course, you know, not gas
[09:39.810 --> 09:40.810]  station CBD.
[09:41.370 --> 09:46.290]  I would recommend cannabis derived, American made, lab tested CBD that we can trust.
[09:46.290 --> 09:48.290]  I'm not sure where you're going to get that.
[09:48.290 --> 09:49.690]  Many people will say a dispensary.
[09:49.690 --> 09:52.090]  Many people will have other recommendations.
[09:52.090 --> 09:56.610]  In Illinois, I don't know your options, but I would get some tried and true, something,
[09:56.610 --> 09:59.210]  a reputable brand of just CBD.
[09:59.210 --> 10:01.410]  If this were a person that I knew, this is what I would recommend.
[10:01.410 --> 10:03.810]  I'm trying to stay away from the dog thing now and get myself in trouble, but you know
[10:03.810 --> 10:05.210]  what I'm talking about here.
[10:05.210 --> 10:09.290]  I would recommend something with just CBD and see if that stops the seizures without
[10:09.290 --> 10:12.810]  fucking up the person or the dog that you're giving this to.
[10:12.810 --> 10:18.090]  Then if that doesn't work, then I would work on something with a one to one THC to CBD
[10:18.090 --> 10:24.010]  ratio, something that has got an equal amount CBD to an equal amount of THC.
[10:24.010 --> 10:29.090]  That way, I believe, I'm not a doctor, but I do believe in the entourage effect.
[10:29.090 --> 10:31.730]  The synergistic effect is what it's also been called.
[10:31.730 --> 10:35.450]  I think that when we isolate cannabinoids, the CBD, it works.
[10:35.450 --> 10:40.490]  I think when we isolate THC, it works, but when we combine those two things and the certain
[10:40.490 --> 10:44.730]  ratios that work for each person's body, that's when I think they work the best.
[10:44.730 --> 10:49.610]  They work the best in conjunction with other cannabinoids, esters, terpenes, palates, all
[10:49.610 --> 10:52.610]  the other products, all the other compounds that come with the cannabis.
[10:52.610 --> 10:54.490]  I think they all work together.
[10:54.490 --> 10:59.130]  I think you may need to find the correct appropriate balance for your patient, which in your case
[10:59.130 --> 11:00.130]  is your dog.
[11:00.130 --> 11:03.770]  So I would start off, you've been giving them something that we don't know the lab results
[11:03.770 --> 11:04.770]  of.
[11:05.090 --> 11:08.890]  I would start off with something we do know lab results of, all CBD if you can get it.
[11:08.890 --> 11:12.290]  Then I would go with something CBD and THC and monitor.
[11:12.290 --> 11:13.690]  If the CBD works, stick with that.
[11:13.690 --> 11:17.330]  If it doesn't, then add some THC to it slowly.
[11:17.330 --> 11:21.930]  A strain that I can recommend that is in my arsenal that is not available on iRedirect.
[11:21.930 --> 11:25.330]  I don't sell this strain, but it is available if you need it, reach out to me.
[11:25.330 --> 11:29.450]  Honestly, right now I'm swamped with emails, but I'm doing my best to dig myself out.
[11:29.450 --> 11:31.690]  I've got a strain that is called Purple Heart.
[11:31.690 --> 11:36.770]  It does often produce phenotypes with a one to one THC to CBD ratio.
[11:36.770 --> 11:41.450]  So however much CBD is available in the plant is also available in the THC.
[11:41.450 --> 11:46.570]  Now we are finding outliers of phenotypes that do become THC dominant and outliers that
[11:46.570 --> 11:47.570]  are THC.
[11:47.570 --> 11:48.570]  Did I say which one?
[11:48.570 --> 11:51.350]  They lean one way to THC, one way to CBD.
[11:51.350 --> 11:55.450]  There are phenotypes that you'll find all types of different cannabinoid ratios, but
[11:55.450 --> 12:01.010]  the majority of them put off a one to one THC to CBD ratio when grown and dried and
[12:01.010 --> 12:02.370]  cured properly.
[12:02.370 --> 12:04.290]  So I would recommend a strain called Purple Heart.
[12:04.290 --> 12:06.570]  I did say that's not available.
[12:06.570 --> 12:09.250]  Purple Heart was made in a friend's grow space.
[12:09.250 --> 12:16.730]  So full disclosure, I guess, I have a friend who I rent grow space from and he wanted me
[12:16.730 --> 12:20.810]  to breed with one of his plants and it was a CBD dominant plant.
[12:20.810 --> 12:23.110]  And he's a veteran.
[12:23.110 --> 12:25.350]  He has served for the United States military.
[12:25.350 --> 12:29.370]  And he said that this CBD plant that he smokes helps with his night terrors and it helps
[12:29.450 --> 12:32.370]  with his PTSD from being in the military.
[12:32.370 --> 12:36.130]  So I wanted to cross that to something and make feminized seeds with it.
[12:36.130 --> 12:40.510]  And when I rented his space, one of his requirements of the space rental was to put that plant
[12:40.510 --> 12:44.790]  in there and breed to it to make something even better for the veterans, for the people
[12:44.790 --> 12:49.650]  that experience PTSD, the night terrors, the other symptoms that come from being in combat
[12:49.650 --> 12:53.170]  and being exposed to things that would probably traumatize most of us for the rest of our
[12:53.170 --> 12:54.210]  lives.
[12:54.210 --> 12:55.210]  That plant helps with that.
[12:55.210 --> 12:57.690]  I wanted to make something like that with my lineup.
[12:57.690 --> 13:01.330]  He said that his cherry plant was really good, but it could be improved upon.
[13:01.330 --> 13:04.010]  I knew that my Afterglow pollen donor was going to be amazing.
[13:04.010 --> 13:07.650]  I put the Afterglow and the cherry CBD plant in the room.
[13:07.650 --> 13:08.650]  They did magic together.
[13:08.650 --> 13:10.410]  Out of that comes Purple Heart.
[13:10.410 --> 13:13.770]  I promised my friend that I would never sell Purple Heart seeds.
[13:13.770 --> 13:15.450]  I gave him a good portion of them.
[13:15.450 --> 13:17.250]  I have a good portion of them.
[13:17.250 --> 13:22.250]  Every Purple Heart seed that has ever left the iReed Genetics office has been for free.
[13:22.250 --> 13:23.450]  I've given them to veterans.
[13:23.450 --> 13:28.290]  I've given them to people with PTSD, night terrors, traumatic problems like that.
[13:28.290 --> 13:30.570]  I try to help them out with the Purple Heart seeds.
[13:30.570 --> 13:31.890]  There are not a lot left right now.
[13:31.890 --> 13:35.890]  I do need to make more, but my friend, if you contact me, I will send you a pack for
[13:35.890 --> 13:36.890]  your dog.
[13:36.890 --> 13:39.370]  You do win a prize pack here for having your message read on the show.
[13:39.370 --> 13:41.050]  Why not send you some Purple Heart?
[13:41.050 --> 13:43.090]  Hopefully, we can help out your canine companion.
[13:43.090 --> 13:44.090]  Big shout out, doggie.
[13:44.090 --> 13:45.090]  You're a good boy.
[13:45.090 --> 13:46.090]  Hope you're doing well, or you're a good girl.
[13:46.090 --> 13:47.970]  I don't know why I just gendered your dog.
[13:47.970 --> 13:49.130]  I apologize.
[13:49.130 --> 13:50.130]  Good doggie.
[13:50.130 --> 13:51.130]  I hope you're doing well.
[13:51.210 --> 13:53.570]  Let's make sure I covered up all the notes on this one.
[13:53.570 --> 13:54.730]  I'm not a veterinarian.
[13:54.730 --> 13:55.730]  I'm not a doctor.
[13:55.730 --> 13:59.130]  Rostagef is not even my real name.
[13:59.130 --> 14:04.130]  I would recommend starting with CBD and then add some THC and see how they work, and then
[14:04.130 --> 14:05.130]  figure out the ratio.
[14:05.130 --> 14:07.130]  It's going to take some dosing.
[14:07.130 --> 14:10.330]  Unfortunately, for me, that's the fun part.
[14:10.330 --> 14:13.070]  For some people, that's the challenging part of cannabis.
[14:13.070 --> 14:17.250]  It's hard to recommend exactly what to take because it's all about how our bodies are
[14:17.250 --> 14:19.870]  going to act and react to that cannabis.
[14:19.870 --> 14:24.310]  The different terpenes, the different cannabinoids, that all hits us differently.
[14:24.310 --> 14:28.870]  I'm the kind of guy that I'll smoke a big fat fucking dab of some sativa concentrates
[14:28.870 --> 14:32.150]  that most people are going to have a panic attack, and that puts me right in the zone
[14:32.150 --> 14:34.690]  to come talk on a podcast for 40 minutes.
[14:34.690 --> 14:37.870]  Most people would be freaking out, running from the lights or having a hard time.
[14:37.870 --> 14:41.790]  If I smoke a heavy, heavy indica, most people get kind of lazy.
[14:41.790 --> 14:45.270]  A heavy, heavy indica makes me want to go for a walk.
[14:45.270 --> 14:46.270]  Our bodies are way different.
[14:46.270 --> 14:50.110]  I've got this ADD brain that just keeps going, makes me talk a million miles an hour, so
[14:50.110 --> 14:52.190]  things work differently for me.
[14:52.190 --> 14:53.190]  All right.
[14:53.190 --> 14:55.110]  I think I rambled on about this one for quite a long time.
[14:55.110 --> 14:57.710]  My buddy Tommy Two Tracks, thank you for the great message.
[14:57.710 --> 15:01.950]  Seriously, I hope the dog is well because the dog is man's best friend, and it just
[15:01.950 --> 15:04.190]  sucks to see a family member suffering.
[15:04.190 --> 15:06.230]  Be happy to help you out with those purple hearts.
[15:06.230 --> 15:07.950]  Send me your address, my dude.
[15:07.950 --> 15:08.950]  All right.
[15:08.950 --> 15:09.950]  We've been going for a few minutes.
[15:09.950 --> 15:12.270]  I do have another message here in front of me.
[15:12.270 --> 15:15.510]  This one came from our friend who wants to be called Billy.
[15:15.510 --> 15:16.830]  Big shout out to our friend Billy.
[15:16.830 --> 15:18.190]  Thank you for the great message.
[15:18.190 --> 15:21.150]  Thank you for helping me generate listener generated content.
[15:21.150 --> 15:22.310]  I do enjoy that.
[15:22.310 --> 15:23.310]  I am rambling.
[15:23.310 --> 15:25.190]  I think I've had too many dabs.
[15:25.190 --> 15:28.870]  This message goes a little bit and quite a bit and just like this.
[15:28.870 --> 15:30.790]  It says, two questions, please, my bro.
[15:30.790 --> 15:33.710]  First, do you ever give your plants cloudy days?
[15:33.710 --> 15:36.950]  By that, I mean dimming the lights like maybe when temps are a little bit hot.
[15:36.950 --> 15:40.510]  Then it says, I've been doing that for a while and they seem to like it.
[15:40.950 --> 15:42.990]  Am I wasting my time?
[15:42.990 --> 15:44.950]  It might be my imagination.
[15:44.950 --> 15:47.110]  That is a good question.
[15:47.110 --> 15:52.110]  I would never turn down the lights in my grow space unless it was required.
[15:52.110 --> 15:55.710]  If it was way too hot, the air conditioner couldn't keep up, the ventilation couldn't
[15:55.710 --> 15:56.710]  keep up.
[15:56.710 --> 15:59.430]  I do not turn down the lights unless there is a problem.
[15:59.430 --> 16:04.110]  I get them at their peak performance, the amount of light that the plants want.
[16:04.110 --> 16:07.470]  I can kind of see if there's too much or not enough light in there at this point.
[16:07.470 --> 16:09.630]  I've been working with the LEDs for a while.
[16:09.750 --> 16:13.670]  I get the plants to their peak performance and then I do not turn down that light or
[16:13.670 --> 16:17.270]  unplug a light ever.
[16:17.270 --> 16:20.990]  Basically think about it like these plants are the UFC fighters of plants.
[16:20.990 --> 16:24.550]  Our cannabis plants, we put them in a cage, you put them in a four by four tent and then
[16:24.550 --> 16:27.510]  we expect them to fucking, let's get ready to rumble.
[16:27.510 --> 16:30.790]  Every single day in that grow room, they're in there for nine or 10 weeks.
[16:30.790 --> 16:34.310]  That's only 63 to 70 days in the flowering phase.
[16:34.310 --> 16:37.910]  I want, and then we've got the veg phase is equally as important as this phase.
[16:37.910 --> 16:39.310]  I should touch on that too.
[16:39.310 --> 16:42.070]  A lot of people overlook the importance of the veg phase.
[16:42.070 --> 16:46.590]  That is the foundation that is building the foundation, the framework, the veg phases
[16:46.590 --> 16:47.750]  equally as important.
[16:47.750 --> 16:52.590]  So in any phase, I do not turn down the lighting because think of it like that's a nine week
[16:52.590 --> 16:55.870]  training camp and at week 10 we got a fight coming up.
[16:55.870 --> 16:58.970]  If you had a fight coming up, you're going in that cage and you're going to swing it
[16:58.970 --> 17:02.470]  out with whoever your favorite UFC fighter is.
[17:02.470 --> 17:06.430]  Would you train every day or would you go 70% some days?
[17:06.550 --> 17:10.910]  Because you know that the other guy is going to fucking 110% every single day.
[17:10.910 --> 17:12.690]  So you got to get in there and go at it.
[17:12.690 --> 17:16.990]  So my theory is no, I would not turn down the lights unless it was detrimental to rescuing
[17:16.990 --> 17:17.990]  the crop.
[17:17.990 --> 17:20.990]  If it got too hot, then I would consider turning down the lights.
[17:20.990 --> 17:24.110]  But no, that is the main source of fuel and energy for our plant.
[17:24.110 --> 17:26.310]  That's what makes everything else happen.
[17:26.310 --> 17:30.470]  That's what drives photosynthesis, which is what drives bud production in the end.
[17:30.470 --> 17:31.630]  Why would I turn that down?
[17:31.630 --> 17:33.870]  So no, I do not give the plants cloudy days.
[17:33.870 --> 17:36.390]  If it's cloudy outside, it's the brightest fuck in the grow room.
[17:36.390 --> 17:38.870]  If it's raining outside, brightest fuck in the grow room.
[17:38.870 --> 17:42.750]  If it's hot as fuck outside, try to keep it decent in the grow room.
[17:42.750 --> 17:44.190]  It's a struggle sometimes.
[17:44.190 --> 17:45.430]  But no, I do not turn down the lights.
[17:45.430 --> 17:46.950]  I do not give them cloudy days.
[17:46.950 --> 17:50.990]  I focus on making sure those plants get as much light as possible before they start getting
[17:50.990 --> 17:52.270]  problems.
[17:52.270 --> 17:56.250]  Make sure they get as much light for as long as they need to keep them in the proper cycle
[17:56.250 --> 17:58.470]  I need them in and to get top performance.
[17:58.470 --> 17:59.950]  So no, I do not change the light.
[17:59.950 --> 18:01.750]  Okay, there is a part two to this question.
[18:01.750 --> 18:02.750]  It goes on.
[18:02.750 --> 18:08.790]  Are plants that start seeding two to three weeks into flower worth keeping?
[18:08.790 --> 18:09.790]  Why are they seeding?
[18:09.790 --> 18:10.790]  That's my main question.
[18:10.790 --> 18:11.790]  Then it goes on.
[18:11.790 --> 18:15.550]  It says, will they concentrate on making seeds and not flower at that point?
[18:15.550 --> 18:17.910]  I always throw away the garbage.
[18:17.910 --> 18:18.910]  You're my guru, bro.
[18:18.910 --> 18:19.910]  Lay some knowledge on me.
[18:19.910 --> 18:21.710]  All right, so we got some things to talk about here.
[18:21.710 --> 18:27.750]  You have asked if plants that start seeding two to three weeks into flower are worth keeping.
[18:27.750 --> 18:32.870]  There's got to be a reason why the seeds are popping up at that stage in the game.
[18:32.870 --> 18:37.750]  Usually plants aren't even able to start producing seeds until about, well, they can, as soon
[18:37.750 --> 18:41.470]  as the pistils are there, they can produce seeds, but you're not going to see seed production
[18:41.470 --> 18:43.710]  for several days after those pistils pop up.
[18:43.710 --> 18:45.030]  They've got to get pollinated.
[18:45.030 --> 18:46.830]  Seeds have to start developing.
[18:46.830 --> 18:50.430]  First of all, I'm wondering if what you're actually seeing is seeds.
[18:50.430 --> 18:51.430]  I'm not doubting you.
[18:51.430 --> 18:52.430]  I haven't seen pictures.
[18:52.430 --> 18:54.070]  I don't know how long you've been growing.
[18:54.070 --> 18:56.070]  I'd like to know if those definitely are seeds.
[18:56.070 --> 18:59.710]  I'd like a very seasoned, experienced grower to look in there and look at those buds and
[18:59.710 --> 19:02.070]  say, no, those are calyxes or no, those are seeds.
[19:02.070 --> 19:05.990]  They could be swollen bracts is what you may be identifying as seeds.
[19:05.990 --> 19:07.070]  Give it a squeeze.
[19:07.070 --> 19:10.750]  Does the bubble thing that looks like a seed, does it pop and is there a seed shell in there
[19:10.750 --> 19:16.430]  or is it just juicy plant, juicy, it'll have like a popcorn kernel in it, but give it a
[19:16.430 --> 19:17.430]  squeeze.
[19:17.430 --> 19:19.750]  See if there's a seed in there or see if that is a swollen bract.
[19:19.750 --> 19:20.910]  You could be very mistaken.
[19:20.910 --> 19:25.030]  A lot of new growers see those little bracts that develop right at the bottom of the node
[19:25.350 --> 19:26.510]  and they think that that's a seed.
[19:26.510 --> 19:27.510]  That is not.
[19:27.510 --> 19:28.510]  That's a bract.
[19:28.510 --> 19:29.510]  Don't be too paranoid.
[19:29.510 --> 19:31.870]  Now, the next thing I want to say is why did seeds happen?
[19:31.870 --> 19:33.510]  If these are seeds, why did they occur?
[19:33.510 --> 19:34.710]  What is causing this?
[19:34.710 --> 19:37.470]  Is there pollen in the room?
[19:37.470 --> 19:39.670]  Have you had a male plant in that room and not cleaned it up?
[19:39.670 --> 19:42.510]  Do you have a male plant in the room that you haven't identified and he's skeeting on
[19:42.510 --> 19:47.990]  the ladies making seeds or maybe my other idea, maybe what you're identifying as seeds,
[19:47.990 --> 19:50.310]  maybe those are male anthers farming on the plant.
[19:50.310 --> 19:51.790]  Maybe you got a male plant.
[19:51.990 --> 19:57.710]  Also, my next question is, was there an intersex plant in this room or are those plants themselves
[19:57.710 --> 19:58.710]  intersex?
[19:58.710 --> 20:02.830]  I really want to get down to where did the seeds, what caused the seeds?
[20:02.830 --> 20:05.650]  First question is like, really are these seeds?
[20:05.650 --> 20:07.350]  Next question would be where do the seeds come from?
[20:07.350 --> 20:10.710]  There's got to be pollen or an intersex issue.
[20:10.710 --> 20:17.230]  Then the next things I would start thinking about is have you over or underwater drastically
[20:17.230 --> 20:19.510]  at any point in late veg or early flower?
[20:19.510 --> 20:22.030]  Is there like a huge flood or a drought?
[20:22.030 --> 20:28.830]  Those things could lead to intersex or possibly maybe this is early rotalization, self-seeding.
[20:28.830 --> 20:29.990]  Maybe that's what's happening.
[20:29.990 --> 20:32.310]  Is your vapor pressure deficit dialed in?
[20:32.310 --> 20:33.310]  Is it too hot in the room?
[20:33.310 --> 20:34.750]  Is it too cold in the room?
[20:34.750 --> 20:35.750]  How's your humidity?
[20:35.750 --> 20:37.470]  Is it too dry, too moist?
[20:37.470 --> 20:40.750]  Are there drastic swings of either of those things?
[20:40.750 --> 20:46.950]  Any drastic swings of any of the VPD can definitely mess up your whole crop and give you intersex
[20:46.950 --> 20:49.390]  traits, definitely give you seeding.
[20:49.470 --> 20:52.270]  I'm not convinced these are seeds the more I talk about it.
[20:52.270 --> 20:53.910]  My next question is how about light leaks?
[20:53.910 --> 20:56.870]  Are you getting any light leaks in your flowering phase?
[20:56.870 --> 21:00.350]  When I say light leaks, some people don't understand exactly what I mean.
[21:00.350 --> 21:04.550]  The light leak means an interruption of the dark period.
[21:04.550 --> 21:06.390]  Cannabis is very photo period sensitive.
[21:06.390 --> 21:09.910]  That's why we put it in a dark period for 12 hours to make it flower.
[21:09.910 --> 21:13.830]  If we interrupt that dark period, the plants get a little bit confused and they start going
[21:13.830 --> 21:16.790]  into what the fuck mode.
[21:16.790 --> 21:21.150]  Just imagine if you will, maybe one day you're outside and the sun goes down.
[21:21.150 --> 21:23.070]  You're like, oh, it's like 7.30, the sun went down.
[21:23.070 --> 21:26.830]  I'm going to go inside and do whatever I do from 7.30 to bedtime.
[21:26.830 --> 21:30.870]  You do your thing, you smoke a couple of bowls, you watch a podcast, you hang out on Discord,
[21:30.870 --> 21:33.430]  eat some ice cream, you go to bed.
[21:33.430 --> 21:37.230]  Then suddenly at like three in the morning, the sun comes up.
[21:37.230 --> 21:38.230]  Just boom, the sun.
[21:38.230 --> 21:42.750]  You're going to look out the window and you're going to go, what the fuck?
[21:42.750 --> 21:43.750]  It's not going to be a good feeling.
[21:43.750 --> 21:46.310]  You're going to say, that's the sun.
[21:46.830 --> 21:47.830]  You're going to look at all of the clocks.
[21:47.830 --> 21:51.470]  You're going to look at your phone, you're going to go, three o'clock, 3 p.m.?
[21:51.470 --> 21:52.470]  No, it's 3 a.m.
[21:52.470 --> 21:55.470]  You're going to look at the iPad, you're going to go, 3 a.m.
[21:55.470 --> 21:58.750]  You're going to look at the microwave, 3 a.m.
[21:58.750 --> 22:00.830]  Look at the computer screen, 3 a.m.
[22:00.830 --> 22:03.470]  You're going to look at your watch because maybe you've got a watch that's analog and
[22:03.470 --> 22:04.710]  hasn't fucked up yet.
[22:04.710 --> 22:05.710]  3 a.m.
[22:05.710 --> 22:06.710]  It's all 3 a.m.
[22:06.710 --> 22:07.710]  Why is the sun up?
[22:07.710 --> 22:10.630]  Then you're going to go to social media and you're going to see that everybody on the
[22:10.630 --> 22:13.230]  fucking planet is freaking out that the sun's up at 3 a.m.
[22:13.230 --> 22:15.430]  You're going to go into full on panic mode.
[22:15.550 --> 22:17.630]  Even if you were a plant, you've got options.
[22:17.630 --> 22:18.630]  You can freak out.
[22:18.630 --> 22:20.190]  You can freak out emotionally, physically.
[22:20.190 --> 22:22.230]  You can try to procreate.
[22:22.230 --> 22:23.390]  That's what the plants are going to do.
[22:23.390 --> 22:26.950]  The plants are going to try to procreate before the end of the fucking world.
[22:26.950 --> 22:30.630]  If you start flipping the sun on in the middle of the night to them, they're going to go,
[22:30.630 --> 22:32.870]  what the fuck, dude?
[22:32.870 --> 22:36.870]  Cannabis' whole goal, the main purpose of a cannabis plant is to reproduce and make
[22:36.870 --> 22:38.950]  seeds for next year.
[22:38.950 --> 22:43.470]  If the plant thinks that Armageddon is fucking coming, that the sun just reversed its schedule,
[22:43.470 --> 22:46.670]  it's going to go, hey bro, I'm going to die.
[22:46.670 --> 22:47.670]  I'm going to make some seeds.
[22:47.670 --> 22:50.830]  It's just going to start spitting out seeds naturally because it doesn't know what the
[22:50.830 --> 22:53.430]  fuck is going on with the world and it wants to survive.
[22:53.430 --> 22:55.510]  It's like Jurassic Park.
[22:55.510 --> 22:56.870]  Life will find a way.
[22:56.870 --> 23:00.190]  That plant will just spit out seeds because it thinks the end of the fucking world is
[23:00.190 --> 23:01.430]  coming.
[23:01.430 --> 23:06.430]  This plant, possibly if there are light leaks, this plant maybe woke up one night at 3 o'clock
[23:06.430 --> 23:09.990]  in the morning and went, the fucking sun's up, bro.
[23:09.990 --> 23:10.990]  Made a bunch of seeds.
[23:11.190 --> 23:14.350]  It may not happen from just one light leak, but if you've got several interruptions or
[23:14.350 --> 23:19.310]  a consistent interruption or perhaps there's one area in the grow space that's just not
[23:19.310 --> 23:21.470]  sealed off, the light's getting in somewhere.
[23:21.470 --> 23:24.870]  I've seen the light come in through like zipper holes in the tents, the ducting holes in the
[23:24.870 --> 23:26.230]  tents.
[23:26.230 --> 23:28.870]  We use the lights with the reflectors inside of the tent sometimes.
[23:28.870 --> 23:32.990]  I've seen the light come down the duct just from the room and come down the duct and then
[23:32.990 --> 23:37.030]  illuminate the whole tent because there's ambient light in the room.
[23:37.030 --> 23:39.470]  So it could be from a light leak could be causing your seeds.
[23:40.030 --> 23:42.990]  The bottom line is I want to know what is causing, first of all, I want to make sure
[23:42.990 --> 23:43.990]  these are seeds.
[23:43.990 --> 23:45.510]  Then I want to know what is causing that.
[23:45.510 --> 23:46.510]  Was it pollen?
[23:46.510 --> 23:47.510]  Was it intersex?
[23:47.510 --> 23:48.510]  Or was it a room problem?
[23:48.510 --> 23:49.630]  Was it a light leak?
[23:49.630 --> 23:50.630]  What is causing that?
[23:50.630 --> 23:53.870]  Then I would make a determination if I would run those plants any further.
[23:53.870 --> 23:57.910]  If I'm seeing seeds a week, two or three, I'm thinking I've got more shit to worry about
[23:57.910 --> 24:02.550]  than just the strain selection, but it very well could be a bad genetics.
[24:02.550 --> 24:03.550]  I don't know who you're running.
[24:03.550 --> 24:04.670]  I don't know what you've got.
[24:04.670 --> 24:06.270]  I don't have that detail in this email.
[24:06.270 --> 24:07.550]  This is just a shorty.
[24:07.550 --> 24:10.750]  So I'm going to say make sure that those are seeds.
[24:10.750 --> 24:11.910]  Go give it a squeeze.
[24:11.910 --> 24:13.910]  See if that's a seed in there.
[24:13.910 --> 24:17.950]  Then if that's a seed in there, find out if there's any pollen or intersex plants.
[24:17.950 --> 24:21.350]  Then check on all the other parameters in the room, which I listed, the vapor pressure
[24:21.350 --> 24:27.550]  deficit over and under watering, and then go in the room and turn off the lights.
[24:27.550 --> 24:32.230]  So when there are lights on in the rest of the area, so I don't know your situation.
[24:32.230 --> 24:33.230]  I don't know your house.
[24:33.230 --> 24:34.230]  I don't know where the grow is.
[24:34.230 --> 24:35.470]  It could be in the jungle.
[24:35.470 --> 24:36.550]  It could be in New York.
[24:36.550 --> 24:39.190]  I don't know where you're growing right now.
[24:39.190 --> 24:40.390]  Maybe you're in a shed.
[24:40.390 --> 24:45.690]  But if you've got lights in that room at the normal time of when that tent or whatever
[24:45.690 --> 24:48.670]  is functioning, go in your grow space, whatever it is.
[24:48.670 --> 24:53.590]  When there are other lights on, like daylight outside preferably, go in the tent or go in
[24:53.590 --> 24:57.690]  the room and turn off all the lights and sit in there for long enough for your vision to
[24:57.690 --> 24:59.310]  adjust to that room.
[24:59.310 --> 25:02.090]  If you can see anything in that room, there's too much light.
[25:02.090 --> 25:04.150]  You need 100% darkness.
[25:04.150 --> 25:07.950]  I went to a grow space one time because my friend told me they just won't flower properly.
[25:07.950 --> 25:08.950]  I don't know what's going on.
[25:08.950 --> 25:13.430]  And I was like, I really think this is a light issue, and we couldn't figure out why.
[25:13.430 --> 25:15.350]  And it was daytime outside.
[25:15.350 --> 25:17.670]  And so I said, turn off all the grow lights in here.
[25:17.670 --> 25:18.670]  Turn off all the lights.
[25:18.670 --> 25:19.750]  Let's see where the light is coming in.
[25:19.750 --> 25:23.590]  And we turned it off, and we realized a window that he had boarded up, the light was just
[25:23.590 --> 25:25.670]  coming through little pieces of the plywood.
[25:25.670 --> 25:28.150]  And there was just full sun coming into that room.
[25:28.150 --> 25:32.150]  So that means when it was dark in that grow space, whatever light was happening outside,
[25:32.150 --> 25:36.790]  if it was a porch light, if it was just the sunshine, if the lights went out before or
[25:36.790 --> 25:43.350]  after, if the sunshine in the dark space didn't coincide, it would fucking interrupt the dark
[25:43.350 --> 25:45.110]  cycle in his grow space.
[25:45.110 --> 25:46.310]  His plants were never going to flower.
[25:46.310 --> 25:49.150]  We had to re-dark, re-blackout that section.
[25:49.150 --> 25:51.510]  So it could be a very well could be a light leak.
[25:51.510 --> 25:53.470]  All right, my buddy Billy, that's your name, right?
[25:53.470 --> 25:55.910]  Yeah, Billy, thank you for the great message, dude.
[25:55.910 --> 25:59.510]  Please do send me your address because I do owe you a free pack of seeds.

[26:48.030 --> 26:51.830]  growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts, I do
[26:51.830 --> 26:55.950]  want to thank you once again for listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[26:55.950 --> 26:56.950]  podcast.
[26:56.950 --> 26:59.590]  I'm crazy at the start of the show to say 795.
[26:59.590 --> 27:02.030]  I'm almost 800 episodes deep.
[27:02.030 --> 27:03.030]  Thank you for all of the support.
[27:03.030 --> 27:06.070]  If you're not already subscribed to the show, please do subscribe.
[27:06.070 --> 27:09.150]  Also, I do feel like the show is shadow banned on YouTube.
[27:09.150 --> 27:12.230]  I don't come up in people's recommended shows and things like that.
[27:12.230 --> 27:14.990]  Of course, it is a cannabis content podcast.
[27:14.990 --> 27:15.990]  I do have a dirty mouth.
[27:15.990 --> 27:17.790]  I say some foul shit sometimes.
[27:17.790 --> 27:19.670]  So maybe I'm a little bit shadow banned.
[27:19.670 --> 27:21.110]  Please share the show with some friends.
[27:21.110 --> 27:22.430]  Tell your friends about the podcast.
[27:22.430 --> 27:23.950]  Let's get the numbers up just a little bit.
[27:23.950 --> 27:27.270]  I love each and every one of you that listen, but it would be great to have more people
[27:27.270 --> 27:28.270]  listening.
[27:28.270 --> 27:30.950]  The more people listening, the better the cannabis will be out there in the world.
[27:30.950 --> 27:35.150]  That way, everywhere you go, you can find good ganja because people are growing good
[27:35.150 --> 27:37.710]  ganja because they're listening to the proper podcast.
[27:37.710 --> 27:38.710]  All right.
[27:38.710 --> 27:41.950]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, I would love to hear from you.

[28:12.630 --> 28:13.630]  All right.
[28:13.630 --> 28:14.630]  That's all I've got for this episode.
[28:14.630 --> 28:16.190]  I'll be back in a week with fresh new content.
