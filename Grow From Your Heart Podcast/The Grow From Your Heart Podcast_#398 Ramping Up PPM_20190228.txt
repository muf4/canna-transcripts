[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  This episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast is dedicated to my friend, Brody Stevens.
[00:07.000 --> 00:08.640]  Welcome to the show, podcast world.
[00:08.640 --> 00:12.240]  It's time for episode 398 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:12.240 --> 00:15.400]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:15.400 --> 00:19.680]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds, and you can
[00:19.680 --> 00:25.880]  find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:25.880 --> 00:30.160]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I am dabbing.
[00:30.160 --> 00:34.440]  Today I'm taking dabs of banana wafer kush from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:34.440 --> 00:41.280]  The label says it is 74.9% THC with 89.6% total cannabinoids.
[00:41.280 --> 00:42.840]  I really like this concentrate.
[00:42.840 --> 00:45.000]  It's got a nice stony effect to it.
[00:45.000 --> 00:46.240]  It's more stony than high.
[00:46.240 --> 00:50.080]  It seems to put me in a nice little bubble, puts me in my own little space in my head
[00:50.080 --> 00:51.640]  here, and I really enjoy that.
[00:51.720 --> 00:56.920]  Today we're taking dabs of the banana wafer kush from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:56.920 --> 00:58.840]  All right, podcast world.
[00:58.840 --> 01:03.280]  In this episode, I'm going to read a few listener emails and answer a few questions, but before
[01:03.280 --> 01:07.900]  I get there, I want to read a comment that came in on the YouTube channel.
[01:07.900 --> 01:10.840]  On the last episode, I talked about the Colorado crunch.
[01:10.840 --> 01:12.260]  Now, what's the Colorado crunch?
[01:12.260 --> 01:16.700]  That is when the herb gets super dry from being left in the jars all day in the dispensary
[01:16.700 --> 01:18.240]  in Colorado.
[01:18.240 --> 01:22.680]  We had a comment that came from a listener named DR on YouTube, and DR says,
[01:22.680 --> 01:25.800]  I just want to add that Boveda packs save my ass.
[01:25.800 --> 01:31.320]  I wish I would see more dispensaries out there using them that don't pre-package their product.
[01:31.320 --> 01:36.920]  I do appreciate the input, but I do also despise Boveda packs or Boveda packs, however you
[01:36.920 --> 01:37.920]  say it.
[01:37.920 --> 01:42.200]  I do not like them in the jars with the product at the dispensary on the shelf.
[01:42.200 --> 01:47.120]  In my opinion, those packs leave a funky aroma and flavor on the buds.
[01:47.640 --> 01:51.040]  Now with that being said, if you like the packs and you like the results that you or
[01:51.040 --> 01:55.100]  your local dispensary are getting by using those packs, don't change anything because
[01:55.100 --> 01:56.160]  of what I say.
[01:56.160 --> 01:57.160]  Do your thing.
[01:57.160 --> 01:58.480]  Let it work for you.
[01:58.480 --> 02:02.360]  But let me make a suggestion for your personal grow.
[02:02.360 --> 02:06.880]  This method wouldn't be practical in a dispensary environment, but it does work in a commercial
[02:06.880 --> 02:10.880]  grow and it would work in your personal grow environment.
[02:10.880 --> 02:16.480]  If your buds get too crunchy, something I suggest is grabbing a leaf from a fresh plant.
[02:16.480 --> 02:19.560]  If you've got a mason jar, one leaf will be enough.
[02:19.560 --> 02:22.320]  Stick one fresh leaf inside your mason jar.
[02:22.320 --> 02:23.320]  Just set it in there.
[02:23.320 --> 02:24.320]  Seal the lid.
[02:24.320 --> 02:26.680]  Leave it in there for like 30, 45 minutes.
[02:26.680 --> 02:30.480]  Crack it open and see how much it has moistened up the rest of those buds.
[02:30.480 --> 02:35.600]  That moisture from that one leaf will move around in those buds very quickly and you're
[02:35.600 --> 02:40.440]  using the same plant with the same bricks level, the same aroma, the same flavor.
[02:40.440 --> 02:44.880]  You're not adding anything different into that jar to make a funky flavor.
[02:44.880 --> 02:49.800]  You are putting the exact same plant in there with the same aroma, the same flavor.
[02:49.800 --> 02:51.240]  You're not going to mess things up.
[02:51.240 --> 02:55.800]  So if you'd like to get away from the Boveda packs, also save yourself a few bucks.
[02:55.800 --> 02:57.320]  That is another option for you.
[02:57.320 --> 02:58.960]  Maybe experiment if you're interested.
[02:58.960 --> 03:03.480]  Again, if you're happy with what you've got going on, don't change anything on my account.
[03:03.480 --> 03:04.760]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[03:04.760 --> 03:08.640]  The only way you're doing it wrong is if you kill the plants or if you're not happy with
[03:08.640 --> 03:10.200]  the final outcome.
[03:10.200 --> 03:13.920]  If you're happy with your final outcome and you're satisfied with your product, keep doing
[03:13.920 --> 03:17.640]  exactly what you're doing, but also keep looking for ways to improve.
[03:17.640 --> 03:21.080]  All right, again, that came from DR on the YouTube channel.
[03:21.080 --> 03:22.520]  Big thanks to our friend DR.
[03:22.520 --> 03:26.200]  Thanks for listening to the show and also thanks for the great feedback and thanks for
[03:26.200 --> 03:28.040]  the great show material.
[03:28.040 --> 03:30.480]  I would appreciate it if everybody finds me on YouTube.
[03:30.480 --> 03:34.640]  Simply go to YouTube and search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast, click subscribe,
[03:34.640 --> 03:38.840]  leave some comments on the videos, and who knows, maybe I will read your comments on
[03:38.840 --> 03:39.840]  a future episode.
[03:40.840 --> 03:44.360]  All right, now it is time to start working through the mountain of emails that I've been
[03:44.360 --> 03:46.080]  saving up for the show.
[03:46.080 --> 03:50.280]  I love and appreciate all of the emails and questions that you guys have sent me, but
[03:50.280 --> 03:54.400]  I was tied up in that long series of grow lessons, so I wasn't really paying much attention
[03:54.400 --> 03:55.440]  to the emails.
[03:55.440 --> 03:59.400]  Now that that series is done, it is time to start working through these emails.
[03:59.400 --> 04:00.560]  So let's get right to it.
[04:00.560 --> 04:05.600]  On the top of the stack here, this one goes just like this.
[04:05.600 --> 04:06.600]  What's up, Rasta Jeff?
[04:06.600 --> 04:09.240]  I've been looking forward to growing for a long time now.
[04:09.240 --> 04:12.300]  Over the past year, I've loved listening through your podcasts.
[04:12.300 --> 04:16.840]  I'm finally ready to get started as all of my equipment was just delivered this week.
[04:16.840 --> 04:20.960]  Dude, first of all, thanks for listening to the show, and second, congratulations on all
[04:20.960 --> 04:21.960]  of the new equipment.
[04:21.960 --> 04:25.200]  I bet that is super exciting.
[04:25.200 --> 04:29.860]  The message goes on to say, I'm going to be working indoor in a 4x4 Vivosun tent.
[04:29.860 --> 04:35.200]  I'm hoping to put four plants in 5-gallon buckets under a 1200-watt LED grow light.
[04:35.200 --> 04:39.800]  I'd like to order seeds from your online store, but the selection is so vast that it's
[04:39.800 --> 04:41.800]  a little intimidating.
[04:41.800 --> 04:45.320]  Now let me jump in and say that I don't have a website that sells seeds.
[04:45.320 --> 04:49.620]  I am a breeder, but my seeds are available on other vendor websites.
[04:49.620 --> 04:55.120]  You are probably referring to the Hella Dank Seed Company at dankseed.store, or possibly
[04:55.120 --> 04:59.320]  you're shopping on Oregon Elite Seeds at oregoneliteseeds.com.
[04:59.320 --> 05:02.520]  There are a couple of other great vendors that carry my products, but those are the
[05:02.520 --> 05:07.240]  two who I have talked about most on here, so that is probably where you are shopping.
[05:07.240 --> 05:10.680]  And yes, I do agree that it can be quite intimidating.
[05:10.680 --> 05:14.320]  I myself offer over 20 different seed lines.
[05:14.320 --> 05:16.820]  There are 20 lines available from just myself.
[05:16.820 --> 05:22.320]  There are probably 20 or 30 different vendors available on the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[05:22.320 --> 05:27.560]  Oregon Elite Seeds has got at least 100 breeders available on their website, so it does get
[05:27.560 --> 05:28.560]  very confusing.
[05:28.560 --> 05:30.160]  It can get very intimidating.
[05:30.160 --> 05:32.360]  It can be overwhelming very quickly.
[05:32.360 --> 05:36.000]  Sometimes when I go to a restaurant or even a dispensary, I complain that there are too
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.000]  many options.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.680]  I say, you should just give me one or two options and say that's what you're eating
[05:39.680 --> 05:43.180]  and take it and shut up and be happy, because right now it's going to take me 30 minutes
[05:43.180 --> 05:46.320]  to sift through all these options just to figure out what I want.
[05:46.320 --> 05:47.320]  So I get it.
[05:47.320 --> 05:48.320]  It can be overwhelming.
[05:48.320 --> 05:49.320]  It can be a lot to think about.
[05:49.320 --> 05:51.360]  It can be a lot to look at.
[05:51.360 --> 05:56.680]  Also some seed strain descriptions can be very deceptive and very misleading.
[05:56.680 --> 06:01.360]  Also it can be very confusing to a new grower what all of the X's and parentheses mean when
[06:01.360 --> 06:02.920]  the genetics are listed.
[06:02.920 --> 06:05.240]  So I totally agree that it can be overwhelming.
[06:05.240 --> 06:07.280]  So let's get ourselves back on track here.
[06:07.280 --> 06:10.440]  The message continues, it goes like this.
[06:10.440 --> 06:14.840]  I was hoping you could provide some suggestions and maybe even some pro tips on growing whichever
[06:14.840 --> 06:16.600]  strain I decide on.
[06:16.600 --> 06:20.760]  Please let me know if I can provide any more information about my situation and help narrow
[06:20.760 --> 06:23.200]  down what would work best.
[06:23.200 --> 06:28.040]  It's going to be my first grow, so I'm not expecting perfect results, but I figure some
[06:28.040 --> 06:30.960]  expert advice could go a long way.
[06:30.960 --> 06:32.240]  Looking forward to hearing from you.
[06:32.240 --> 06:35.600]  And then they signed it with their name, which I do not have permission to say on the show,
[06:35.600 --> 06:36.600]  so I'm going to hold that back.
[06:36.600 --> 06:38.400]  But hey dude, you know who you are.
[06:38.400 --> 06:40.040]  Thank you for the great email.
[06:40.040 --> 06:42.840]  Let's start answering a couple of your questions.
[06:42.840 --> 06:47.600]  I really think you've got the right idea with four, five gallon pots in this environment.
[06:47.600 --> 06:49.540]  That should be just enough space.
[06:49.540 --> 06:51.280]  Don't let the plants get too tall.
[06:51.280 --> 06:55.080]  I don't know how much ceiling height you've got in your tent, but make sure you flower
[06:55.080 --> 06:58.560]  soon enough to where those plants don't reach up into your light.
[06:58.560 --> 07:01.440]  Also make sure that you've got plenty of airflow in that tent.
[07:01.440 --> 07:06.000]  You need some way to pull that moist, hot, stale air out of the top of that tent and
[07:06.000 --> 07:09.640]  let fresh, new, cool air come in into the bottom of the tent so that you can keep those
[07:09.640 --> 07:11.680]  plants in a healthy environment.
[07:11.680 --> 07:15.800]  Many new growers overlook the importance of airflow when they are building a grow in a
[07:15.800 --> 07:21.120]  tent, so please make sure to have some way to remove that humidity out of the tent.
[07:21.120 --> 07:22.640]  It won't go out by itself.
[07:22.640 --> 07:27.200]  You need an extraction fan coming out of the tent to suck that humidity out of there.
[07:27.200 --> 07:30.960]  And honestly, I don't know much about that brand of tent and I don't know much about
[07:30.960 --> 07:34.360]  LEDs, but it sounds like you're off to a good start with your grow.
[07:34.360 --> 07:38.480]  So let's focus more on the seed aspect of your question.
[07:38.480 --> 07:42.680]  Selecting new seeds for your very first grow can be a lot of fun.
[07:42.680 --> 07:48.500]  I would recommend finding a strain that does not take a really long time to finish.
[07:48.500 --> 07:52.040]  Something around eight weeks would be ideal for a new grower.
[07:52.040 --> 07:54.840]  That is less time to screw up the product.
[07:54.840 --> 07:58.800]  For a new grower, that extra week or two is a lot more opportunity for things to go
[07:58.800 --> 07:59.800]  wrong.
[07:59.800 --> 08:04.520]  So try to find something that finishes around eight or nine weeks would be my first suggestion.
[08:04.520 --> 08:07.720]  So as you're scrolling through and you're looking at flower times, if you see that it
[08:07.720 --> 08:12.160]  says it's going to take nine to 10 or 10 to 11 weeks, I would kind of steer away from
[08:12.160 --> 08:16.040]  that and find something a little quicker in the flower area.
[08:16.040 --> 08:20.240]  Something else to think about, do you want to grow regular or feminized seeds?
[08:20.240 --> 08:22.360]  You've only got room for four.
[08:22.360 --> 08:25.160]  Those are the folks that I recommend feminized seeds to.
[08:25.160 --> 08:29.160]  Folks with very limited space and not a lot of experience, those feminized seeds will
[08:29.160 --> 08:31.280]  help you out in several different ways.
[08:31.280 --> 08:33.600]  First, you don't have to look for the males.
[08:33.600 --> 08:38.080]  Second, you don't plant a plant and then grow it and then flower it and realize you've got
[08:38.080 --> 08:39.340]  to throw it away.
[08:39.340 --> 08:42.760]  If you were phenohunting, if you were that type of a grower, that's when I suggest you
[08:42.760 --> 08:44.040]  get regular seeds.
[08:44.040 --> 08:48.240]  But someone in your situation, I may suggest feminized seeds.
[08:48.240 --> 08:51.160]  Now I know you said you were looking for irigenetic seeds.
[08:51.160 --> 08:56.320]  Let's talk about some irigenetics suggestions that may work well in that grow.
[08:56.320 --> 09:00.240]  Something that I would recommend that is not feminized would be prana.
[09:00.240 --> 09:03.200]  Prana is flow cross to arise.
[09:03.200 --> 09:05.440]  That flow keeps it kind of short and stocky.
[09:05.440 --> 09:06.760]  It smells really nice.
[09:06.760 --> 09:07.920]  It grows nice and bushy.
[09:07.920 --> 09:09.800]  It would work well in your environment.
[09:09.800 --> 09:12.080]  My next recommendation would be sunkiss.
[09:12.080 --> 09:13.640]  Sunkiss is not feminized.
[09:13.640 --> 09:18.640]  It is a regular seed, but it stays nice and short and squat and it grows real wide and
[09:18.640 --> 09:21.880]  branchy and I think it would work great in your environment.
[09:21.880 --> 09:25.840]  Now for feminized options, I would recommend the Michelangelo.
[09:25.840 --> 09:28.000]  Again we've got the platinum tangy in there.
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.240]  That is crossed to my blueberry cookies.
[09:30.240 --> 09:31.840]  That one won't get super tall on you.
[09:31.840 --> 09:33.000]  It's really easy to grow.
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.000]  It produces well.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.960]  It makes a lot of resin and it smells and tastes like oranges and funky candies and
[09:38.960 --> 09:40.640]  it is delicious.
[09:40.640 --> 09:43.400]  Another one I would recommend is the Raphael.
[09:43.400 --> 09:48.600]  Raphael does take a little bit longer to finish, but it is very quality product and it is very,
[09:48.600 --> 09:49.840]  very simple to grow.
[09:49.840 --> 09:54.320]  She won't give you any problems except she'll get very large buds, which for a new grower
[09:54.320 --> 09:56.240]  will feel very rewarding.
[09:56.240 --> 09:58.520]  You'll have to learn how to keep those buds from toppling over.
[09:58.520 --> 10:02.040]  You'll have to learn how to use stakes or tomato cages or a trellis or something, but
[10:02.040 --> 10:04.440]  it will be a very rewarding experience.
[10:04.440 --> 10:09.240]  And of course, the Raphael is available only in feminized seeds.
[10:09.240 --> 10:11.040]  Another one I would suggest is Bebop.
[10:11.040 --> 10:12.540]  Bebop is easy to grow.
[10:12.540 --> 10:14.960]  It makes a lot of trichomes and giant buds.
[10:14.960 --> 10:17.880]  Again, you're going to have to give it some sort of support.
[10:17.880 --> 10:22.240]  Bebop will make huge buds early in flower, so it needs sticks or tomato cages or something
[10:22.240 --> 10:24.680]  to keep those big buds from flopping over.
[10:24.680 --> 10:27.980]  Again, Bebop is only available in feminized seeds.
[10:27.980 --> 10:33.880]  My next and final suggestion, my strain specific recommendation will be Rocksteady.
[10:33.880 --> 10:35.840]  Rocksteady is another one of my crosses.
[10:35.840 --> 10:41.480]  It is feminized and it does produce giant buds that are covered in resin and they smell
[10:41.480 --> 10:43.280]  amazing.
[10:43.440 --> 10:48.240]  There are six great options I can recommend just for my own seed line that I feel would
[10:48.240 --> 10:50.880]  work perfectly in your environment.
[10:50.880 --> 10:54.720]  It does not hurt my feelings at all if you choose to work with another breeder.
[10:54.720 --> 10:58.320]  There are so many breeders out there because we all offer something different.
[10:58.320 --> 11:02.080]  My friend Mr. Soul said it's kind of like bands and music listeners.
[11:02.080 --> 11:05.280]  One guy's out there playing one kind of music, one guy's out there playing another kind of
[11:05.280 --> 11:06.280]  music.
[11:06.280 --> 11:09.680]  People are naturally going to walk to the kind of music that draws them.
[11:09.680 --> 11:10.720]  I don't take it personally.
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.480]  If you prefer another seed company over me, they're doing something different, I'm doing
[11:14.480 --> 11:15.660]  something different.
[11:15.660 --> 11:17.680]  That's how the world is supposed to work.
[11:17.680 --> 11:21.680]  But if you're going to buy seeds from another breeder, I highly suggest you get something
[11:21.680 --> 11:25.760]  from a reputable breeder, somebody that you have heard of, somebody who has been around
[11:25.760 --> 11:29.640]  for a little while, somebody who has a positive online presence.
[11:29.640 --> 11:33.560]  Maybe go check out their online, their social media presence and see how they interact with
[11:33.560 --> 11:34.560]  people.
[11:34.560 --> 11:36.120]  Go check out their customer service.
[11:36.120 --> 11:41.960]  I definitely suggest you do research on the breeder before you purchase seeds from them.
[11:41.960 --> 11:45.040]  Also, buy from a reputable vendor.
[11:45.040 --> 11:48.080]  There are so many seed vendors available online right now.
[11:48.080 --> 11:50.040]  Who knows what they're going to send you?
[11:50.040 --> 11:52.200]  Who knows when they're going to send it?
[11:52.200 --> 11:57.200]  Do your best to do your research on the seed company and the seed vendor you are going
[11:57.200 --> 11:58.440]  to spend your money with.
[11:58.440 --> 11:59.560]  Don't get yourself ripped off.
[11:59.560 --> 12:04.120]  The internet is a black hole of scam artists and there are plenty of people out there just
[12:04.120 --> 12:05.480]  trying to take your money.
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.960]  Do your research before you give anybody your credit card information.
[12:09.960 --> 12:14.480]  There are several reputable, reliable, honest seed vendors out there.
[12:14.480 --> 12:16.960]  I'm going to list a few that I work with personally.
[12:16.960 --> 12:19.400]  I work with the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[12:19.400 --> 12:21.160]  I work with Organ Elite Seeds.
[12:21.160 --> 12:23.040]  I work with Southern Organ Seeds.
[12:23.040 --> 12:26.600]  I work with the Seed Bazaar and I work with Gringo Beans.
[12:26.600 --> 12:30.320]  I can give all of them a five-star rating and a thumbs up.
[12:30.480 --> 12:36.280]  So again, real quick, Organ Elite Seeds, Hella Dank Seed Company, Southern Organ Seeds, the
[12:36.280 --> 12:38.960]  Seed Bazaar, and Gringo Beans.
[12:38.960 --> 12:45.120]  Those are five reliable seed vendors that I can confidently recommend to my listeners.
[12:45.120 --> 12:49.440]  So now I have made a few suggestions on seeds from my lines that would work perfectly for
[12:49.440 --> 12:50.440]  you.
[12:50.440 --> 12:54.320]  I have recommended that you buy from a reputable breeder and I have also suggested that you
[12:54.320 --> 12:59.080]  buy from a reputable vendor, but let's talk about the most important part.
[12:59.080 --> 13:03.440]  The most important part is the consumer and what that consumer enjoys.
[13:03.440 --> 13:07.720]  I'm going to assume that you are the person that is going to be smoking most of this finished
[13:07.720 --> 13:08.720]  product.
[13:08.720 --> 13:10.280]  So what do you like to smoke?
[13:10.280 --> 13:11.320]  What are you into?
[13:11.320 --> 13:13.400]  Do you like gassy smells?
[13:13.400 --> 13:14.920]  Do you like fruity smells?
[13:14.920 --> 13:15.920]  Do you like oranges?
[13:15.920 --> 13:17.540]  Do you like strawberries?
[13:17.540 --> 13:20.240]  Do you like just weird funkiness?
[13:20.240 --> 13:24.440]  Think about what type of aromas and flavors you enjoy when you smoke cannabis.
[13:24.440 --> 13:27.560]  Maybe you smoked something in the past that really stood out to you.
[13:27.560 --> 13:29.360]  What type of flavors did that have?
[13:29.360 --> 13:31.440]  Do you remember what strain that was?
[13:31.440 --> 13:33.040]  Maybe you can find that strain.
[13:33.040 --> 13:36.760]  Maybe you can find a phenotype that really represents what you had in the past and then
[13:36.760 --> 13:39.800]  you can have that around for your own personal grow.
[13:39.800 --> 13:41.800]  It's really all about what you enjoy.
[13:41.800 --> 13:46.520]  And at this point in the cannabis evolution or revolution, you can probably find something
[13:46.520 --> 13:48.920]  to fit your palate exactly.
[13:48.920 --> 13:52.360]  If you were into garlic mashed potatoes and onions, there is a strain that smells like
[13:52.360 --> 13:53.360]  that.
[13:53.360 --> 13:58.360]  If you were into oranges covered in sugar with a little bit of cherry juice dusted on
[13:58.360 --> 14:02.160]  it, there is a strain that smells and tastes like that.
[14:02.160 --> 14:03.640]  You've just got to check the menu.
[14:03.640 --> 14:06.480]  You've got to kind of find what works for you.
[14:06.480 --> 14:09.840]  Now the next thing I would think about, what type of effect are you looking for?
[14:09.840 --> 14:12.000]  Do you want that racing head buzz?
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.160]  Do you need a big sativa high or do you need that chilled out indica put you in the couch,
[14:17.160 --> 14:18.960]  watch some cartoons sort of a thing?
[14:18.960 --> 14:20.220]  What do you desire?
[14:20.220 --> 14:22.640]  Are you consuming for a medicinal effect?
[14:22.640 --> 14:27.120]  Are you consuming just because you're a pothead and I'm not judging you either way that just
[14:27.120 --> 14:31.080]  makes a difference in your selection in what you're going to grow.
[14:31.080 --> 14:33.280]  Also what are you going to do with the final product?
[14:33.280 --> 14:35.480]  Are you going to smoke it in flower form?
[14:35.480 --> 14:37.380]  Are you going to press it into rosin?
[14:37.380 --> 14:38.880]  Are you going to make bubble hash?
[14:38.880 --> 14:42.680]  Are you going to make some type of BHO or hydrocarbon extraction?
[14:42.680 --> 14:47.520]  That is another thing to keep in mind when you are planning your seed selection.
[14:47.520 --> 14:51.240]  So that's my guidance on selecting seeds for your very first grow.
[14:51.240 --> 14:53.040]  I want to continue with the email.
[14:53.040 --> 14:54.300]  There's a lot more to cover.
[14:54.300 --> 14:58.480]  You also say, I was hoping you could provide some suggestions and maybe even some pro tips
[14:58.480 --> 15:01.800]  on growing whichever strain I decide on.
[15:01.800 --> 15:05.840]  Yeah, man, when you make your selection, let me know what you decide and I will send you
[15:05.840 --> 15:08.000]  all of the tips and tricks I can think of.
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.760]  I'll send you some cheat codes and we can get your garden booming on your very first
[15:11.760 --> 15:12.840]  run.
[15:12.840 --> 15:16.520]  You also go on to say, please let me know if I can provide any more information about
[15:16.520 --> 15:17.520]  my situation.
[15:17.520 --> 15:21.020]  Man, it sounds like you did a pretty good job explaining what you've got going on.
[15:21.020 --> 15:24.460]  You made it clear the size of your environment and the amount and size of pots you're going
[15:24.460 --> 15:26.100]  to put in there and the amount of light.
[15:26.100 --> 15:29.460]  As long as you've got some airflow in there, I think you'll be doing just fine.
[15:29.460 --> 15:32.900]  I would also recommend some carbon filtration, but other than that, it sounds like you were
[15:32.900 --> 15:34.500]  off to a good start.
[15:34.500 --> 15:37.540]  The last line of your message says that it's going to be your first grow, so you're not
[15:37.540 --> 15:42.260]  expecting perfect results, but you know that some expert advice will go a long way.
[15:42.260 --> 15:44.420]  Hey, expect perfect results, man.
[15:44.420 --> 15:47.180]  Strive for perfection in your first grow.
[15:47.180 --> 15:51.180]  Now I do have some expert advice for you that will help your first grow be perfect
[15:51.180 --> 15:54.020]  if you do pay close attention to details.
[15:54.020 --> 16:00.460]  My first piece of advice is to buy a grow book from a reputable grow author, a cannabis
[16:00.460 --> 16:06.180]  expert, somebody who has done this repeatedly for years and has the knowledge to put it
[16:06.180 --> 16:07.400]  into a book.
[16:07.400 --> 16:11.720]  Buy one or two books, then read those books.
[16:11.720 --> 16:14.980]  The books are no good if you buy them and set them by the toilet and it looks like you're
[16:14.980 --> 16:16.820]  cool because you have those books.
[16:16.820 --> 16:19.300]  You look cool because you have them, but they don't do shit for you.
[16:19.300 --> 16:21.040]  You don't have the knowledge that is in that book.
[16:21.040 --> 16:24.060]  It looks like you've got the knowledge that's in that book, but if I ask you a question
[16:24.060 --> 16:28.020]  and you haven't read the book, you don't get the knowledge just by sitting it there.
[16:28.020 --> 16:32.260]  I do hope that in the future we can buy USB thumb drives and you can just pop them into
[16:32.260 --> 16:36.220]  the little USB port right behind your ear and your neck, and then you can upload all
[16:36.220 --> 16:39.740]  of the information from that book into your brain, but we are not there yet.
[16:39.740 --> 16:43.380]  So you do have to buy the book, you have to open it, and you have to read it.
[16:43.380 --> 16:47.340]  So read a couple of reputable grow books.
[16:47.340 --> 16:53.020]  My next piece of expert advice would be to go back to episode 351 and start listening
[16:53.020 --> 16:58.420]  to the grow series from episode 351 and catch all of the grow lessons that take you from
[16:58.420 --> 17:02.580]  the very beginning of the grow all the way through harvest, all the way through cleaning
[17:02.580 --> 17:06.220]  up, all the way through smoking your finished product.
[17:06.220 --> 17:10.460]  So go back and listen to all of the grow lessons and I feel like you will have a good head
[17:10.460 --> 17:13.060]  start on your first grow.
[17:13.060 --> 17:17.860]  If you're not the type of person that will go back and pick out the grow lesson episodes,
[17:17.860 --> 17:23.500]  that's okay because I plan to do compilations of all of the lessons uninterrupted consecutively.
[17:23.500 --> 17:27.900]  So what I mean by that is I'm going to find the first grow lesson, the second grow lesson,
[17:27.900 --> 17:33.180]  the third grow lesson, and I will put just the lessons in order in a long episode in
[17:33.180 --> 17:34.880]  about three hour chunks.
[17:34.880 --> 17:39.500]  So however many episodes will fit in a three hour chunk, that's how many will go in episode
[17:39.500 --> 17:44.940]  401 and then the next group of lessons will go in 402 and I'm going to do that until we
[17:44.940 --> 17:47.100]  get through that entire grow series.
[17:47.100 --> 17:51.540]  That way all of the lessons are out there uninterrupted without those random episodes,
[17:51.540 --> 17:55.540]  me and Mike talking and me talking about random shit in the middle of the grow series.
[17:55.540 --> 18:00.580]  So I plan to put it all out in a consecutive chunk without interruptions in the very near
[18:00.580 --> 18:01.580]  future.
[18:01.580 --> 18:05.100]  All right, I want to thank you once again for that email and I do look forward to hearing
[18:05.100 --> 18:11.020]  from you when you make your Irie genetics selection and you get that garden started.
[18:11.020 --> 18:15.340]  All right, I'm going to jump right into the next email and it goes like this.
[18:15.340 --> 18:19.740]  Rasta Jeff, I've been growing at home for a little over two years and have grown approximately
[18:19.740 --> 18:25.660]  15 plants with results varying from average to probably below average results.
[18:25.660 --> 18:30.820]  Hey, first of all, I'm proud of you for being able to admit that you had below average or
[18:30.820 --> 18:32.380]  average results.
[18:32.380 --> 18:36.060]  Most growers think that their first product is the most amazing shit that they have ever
[18:36.060 --> 18:38.160]  grown and they've got an ego problem.
[18:38.160 --> 18:41.540]  So you were already doing better than a lot of growers.
[18:41.540 --> 18:45.140]  The email goes on to say, all of my plants have been healthy looking and grow well in
[18:45.140 --> 18:46.700]  the vegetative stage.
[18:46.700 --> 18:51.380]  I have used a variety of nutrients with none of them appearing to be some kind of magic
[18:51.380 --> 18:52.380]  bullet.
[18:52.380 --> 18:54.340]  Yes, that is absolutely accurate.
[18:54.340 --> 18:55.340]  That is correct.
[18:55.340 --> 18:58.700]  There is no magic bullet when it comes to plant nutrients.
[18:58.700 --> 19:01.940]  There are a lot of things that go into keeping a plant happy.
[19:01.940 --> 19:07.340]  Nutrients are a very small part of that pie and no nutrient bottle or nutrient company
[19:07.340 --> 19:11.180]  is a magic solution or a magic bullet like you've said.
[19:11.180 --> 19:17.020]  The email goes on to say, I am currently experimenting with the CNS17 line from Botanicare in deep
[19:17.020 --> 19:18.400]  water culture.
[19:18.400 --> 19:22.080]  And of course that CNS stands for commercial nutrient system.
[19:22.080 --> 19:24.420]  That should work great in the deep water culture there.
[19:24.420 --> 19:29.100]  He also says, I use recharge, CalMag, and a bloom booster in flower.
[19:29.100 --> 19:35.020]  I feel like I can read plants relatively well, but I find myself unsure as to the quantity
[19:35.020 --> 19:40.540]  of nutrients to provide through plants different stages.
[19:40.540 --> 19:45.740]  Typically I find myself doing a sort of ramp up at a rate of about 200 ppms per week from
[19:45.740 --> 19:53.180]  week one after seed sprout until I hit 1200 ish ppms and that is typically where I usually
[19:53.180 --> 19:54.180]  plateau.
[19:54.180 --> 19:57.300]  I am a little nervous to go too high too fast.
[19:57.300 --> 20:02.300]  Can you give me any tips on how to do a better job of pushing my plants or how you go about
[20:02.300 --> 20:05.100]  determining how much is just right?
[20:05.100 --> 20:07.620]  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
[20:07.620 --> 20:13.340]  On another note, you have hands down the best podcast for cannabis information out there.
[20:13.340 --> 20:17.420]  The sound quality, information, and care you take is definitely noticed.
[20:17.420 --> 20:22.140]  Also, not a man crush thing but you have a great radio voice, I could fall asleep to
[20:22.140 --> 20:23.140]  that shit.
[20:23.140 --> 20:27.940]  Can't wait to run a batch of Arise when Hella Dank has them back in.
[20:27.940 --> 20:30.900]  On the other note about the best podcast, dude, I appreciate that.
[20:30.900 --> 20:34.540]  There is no competition, but when you were told you're the best, honestly, it will always
[20:34.540 --> 20:36.260]  put a smile on your face.
[20:36.260 --> 20:37.260]  Thank you.
[20:37.260 --> 20:38.260]  I appreciate that.
[20:38.260 --> 20:40.340]  The sound quality is truly important to me.
[20:40.340 --> 20:41.340]  I am a sound nerd.
[20:41.340 --> 20:45.220]  I've got a lot of great sound equipment, so I appreciate you noticing that.
[20:45.220 --> 20:46.220]  Thanks for noticing.
[20:46.220 --> 20:49.820]  The information and care I take are definitely important to me.
[20:49.820 --> 20:54.900]  I try to put out accurate information that is useful and gives you some sort of quality
[20:54.900 --> 20:57.820]  and improves your life some way, gives you some sort of value.
[20:57.820 --> 20:59.820]  I make sure I put that in each show.
[20:59.820 --> 21:02.020]  The care, it comes from my heart.
[21:02.020 --> 21:05.780]  Everything I do, grow from my heart, drum from my heart, podcast from my heart, that
[21:05.780 --> 21:06.780]  is from my heart.
[21:06.780 --> 21:08.780]  Thank you for noticing.
[21:08.780 --> 21:11.740]  The radio voice, dude, I hear that a lot, so it is not weird.
[21:11.740 --> 21:14.780]  I can't stand my own voice in these headphones.
[21:14.780 --> 21:18.060]  When I listen back to edit the show, I'm like, who is that asshole rambling?
[21:18.060 --> 21:19.060]  I can't take it.
[21:19.060 --> 21:21.220]  Thank you for the compliment on the voice.
[21:21.220 --> 21:22.500]  You could fall asleep to that shit.
[21:22.500 --> 21:23.500]  That's kind of weird.
[21:23.500 --> 21:26.980]  I probably give people weird dreams if you fell asleep to me.
[21:26.980 --> 21:29.300]  I can only imagine what kind of dreams you would have.
[21:29.300 --> 21:33.060]  Then you wrap up with, can't wait to run a batch of Arise when they're back in stock.
[21:33.060 --> 21:34.140]  Well, guess what, bro?
[21:34.140 --> 21:37.580]  They are back in stock, so go check them out before they run out.
[21:37.580 --> 21:41.740]  They should have five packs and 10 packs available at this time.
[21:41.740 --> 21:45.220]  Now let's focus on the nutrient part of your question.
[21:45.220 --> 21:48.300]  It sounds like you've got all the right tools in your arsenal.
[21:48.300 --> 21:52.500]  You've got the Botanicare commercial nutrient system lineup.
[21:52.500 --> 21:55.000]  You've got some recharge in there to give yourself a root boost.
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.420]  You've got CalMag because of course, high performance plants will get a CalMag deficiency
[21:59.420 --> 22:02.180]  and a bloom booster later in flower.
[22:02.180 --> 22:04.140]  It sounds like you've got all of the right tools.
[22:04.140 --> 22:06.540]  You've got the right idea for the ramp up.
[22:06.540 --> 22:11.500]  However, you could go a little bit higher later in flower.
[22:11.500 --> 22:17.100]  With that Botanicare lineup and those additives, you could probably push to the 15 or 1600
[22:17.100 --> 22:19.900]  BPM range and not cause any problems.
[22:19.900 --> 22:26.580]  Honestly, you could probably go a little bit higher if you do not double up on any elements.
[22:26.580 --> 22:31.060]  So if you know how much nitrogen is in each product and you know how much phosphorus is
[22:31.060 --> 22:34.580]  in each product and you can balance it out to where you don't overdose anything, you
[22:34.580 --> 22:36.940]  can probably go pretty high.
[22:36.940 --> 22:41.580]  There are some variables I would like to know before I give too much advice about this grow,
[22:41.580 --> 22:43.820]  such as, is there CO2 running?
[22:43.820 --> 22:45.620]  What type of lighting are you using?
[22:45.620 --> 22:49.380]  I just want to know about your environment and your overall setup because that would
[22:49.380 --> 22:52.700]  tell me where we can improve.
[22:52.700 --> 22:56.700]  If you have CO2, you can probably run a little higher PPMs.
[22:56.700 --> 23:01.300]  If you've got stronger lighting, the plants can handle higher PPMs because they have enough
[23:01.300 --> 23:04.340]  light energy to metabolize those nutrients.
[23:04.340 --> 23:09.660]  If you've got low quality lighting, you can't feed as strongly because they're not metabolizing
[23:09.660 --> 23:10.660]  it.
[23:10.660 --> 23:13.420]  If you've got powerful lights and CO2, you can feed the shit out of them and you may
[23:13.420 --> 23:15.040]  not see any burn.
[23:15.040 --> 23:19.520]  If you feed that same feed regimen to a plant that you're not augmenting CO2 and you're
[23:19.520 --> 23:22.480]  running it under a fluorescent, it's going to burn.
[23:22.480 --> 23:26.920]  So with so many variables, I have to be careful with my advice and my suggestions here.
[23:26.920 --> 23:30.880]  You do have the right idea, starting low and working your way up.
[23:30.880 --> 23:34.680]  Have you thought about working your way up until you burn the shit out of one of them?
[23:34.680 --> 23:38.240]  Honestly, that is how I find my plants limits.
[23:38.240 --> 23:42.960]  I increase the PPMs until I see, I call it getting their nails done.
[23:42.960 --> 23:46.320]  Think about the plant leaf looking like a hand and when you see the tips starting to
[23:46.320 --> 23:50.400]  get yellow or starting to get funky colors, they're getting their nails done.
[23:50.400 --> 23:54.700]  As soon as you see one of the ladies starting to get her nails done, you know you have pushed
[23:54.700 --> 23:56.620]  it right to the limit.
[23:56.620 --> 24:00.480]  You can either continue to go that hard and they'll just keep burning just a little bit
[24:00.480 --> 24:03.720]  and you probably won't see it in the final product because you're going to trim off all
[24:03.720 --> 24:06.980]  of that leaf honestly and you're going to flush it also.
[24:06.980 --> 24:07.980]  You won't even notice.
[24:07.980 --> 24:12.320]  So you can push it a little bit if you know what you're doing with each nutrient and you
[24:12.320 --> 24:16.880]  say that you've got a good eye on the plants, so I think this may be where you're headed.
[24:16.880 --> 24:18.640]  Push them, see what it does.
[24:18.640 --> 24:21.640]  Now when you start pushing, you've got to decide, do I want to keep pushing it and see
[24:21.640 --> 24:26.440]  how this burn progresses or do I want to stop right where I am and keep giving it that or
[24:26.440 --> 24:29.180]  do I want to dial back and prevent more burn?
[24:29.180 --> 24:31.520]  That's where you have to think about it as a grower.
[24:31.520 --> 24:33.480]  That's where you have to make the decision.
[24:33.480 --> 24:38.040]  I think the move at this time is to increase the PPMs later in flower and see how much
[24:38.040 --> 24:39.140]  they can take.
[24:39.140 --> 24:43.860]  Push it until you burn them and see if you come out with a better harvest.
[24:43.860 --> 24:46.820]  You're already not satisfied, so what could go wrong?
[24:46.820 --> 24:50.760]  Are you going to be less satisfied if you do some experimentation?
[24:50.760 --> 24:55.100]  You may do an experiment and you may improve your garden dramatically.
[24:55.100 --> 24:58.700]  Another thing we need to keep in mind is, could this be a genetic issue?
[24:58.700 --> 25:01.100]  Do you simply have weak genetics?
[25:01.100 --> 25:02.420]  I'm not making fun of you.
[25:02.420 --> 25:03.540]  I'm not calling you out.
[25:03.540 --> 25:06.580]  I'm just saying that this is an option.
[25:06.620 --> 25:10.180]  Genetic potential may be your limiting factor at this time.
[25:10.180 --> 25:11.640]  You've got deep water culture.
[25:11.640 --> 25:12.940]  You've got good nutrients.
[25:12.940 --> 25:14.860]  I said earlier, I don't know about your environment.
[25:14.860 --> 25:18.300]  I don't know about your lights, your air, your water, your soil.
[25:18.300 --> 25:20.780]  I don't know about your personal attention to the plants.
[25:20.780 --> 25:22.220]  I don't know about that.
[25:22.220 --> 25:26.140]  But one thing that could be limiting you is the genetics.
[25:26.140 --> 25:30.540]  Your email starts off by saying that you've grown approximately 15 plants, but I really
[25:30.540 --> 25:35.340]  don't know if that was the same plant 15 times or if you've grown 15 different seeds or 15
[25:35.340 --> 25:36.340]  different cuts.
[25:36.380 --> 25:41.140]  I really don't know, but maybe genetics are what are holding you back.
[25:41.140 --> 25:42.940]  So it sounds like you've got the right nutrients.
[25:42.940 --> 25:47.340]  I would start pushing them, push them a little bit harder and watch for nutrient burn.
[25:47.340 --> 25:51.420]  Once you do see a little bit of nutrient burn, that's when you need to decide, do I want
[25:51.420 --> 25:52.420]  to dial it back?
[25:52.420 --> 25:55.440]  Do I want to keep going or do I want to go a little bit stronger?
[25:55.440 --> 25:56.660]  You're in deep water culture.
[25:56.660 --> 25:59.700]  I don't know if your plants are in individual buckets.
[25:59.700 --> 26:04.180]  I don't know if you've got one main reservoir feeding each plant, but if they're in individual
[26:04.180 --> 26:07.340]  buckets, why not test each plant differently?
[26:07.340 --> 26:08.900]  I don't know how many plants you're growing.
[26:08.900 --> 26:11.500]  Maybe you've only got one, so you've only got one option.
[26:11.500 --> 26:16.540]  But if you've got multiple plants, why not try one with your 1200 max PPMs that you're
[26:16.540 --> 26:21.220]  used to and mark that plant, the one getting fed low PPMs, then mark the other plant, the
[26:21.220 --> 26:25.900]  one getting fed medium PPMs and go to 14 with that one, then take another one and hit it
[26:25.900 --> 26:30.540]  at 16, then get another one and feed it all the way up to 18 and feed another one all
[26:30.540 --> 26:32.860]  the way up to 20 and see what happens.
[26:32.860 --> 26:34.260]  Some of them will burn.
[26:34.260 --> 26:39.260]  Some of them will definitely show you nitrogen toxicity or some sort of a phosphorus overdose.
[26:39.260 --> 26:41.620]  You will see some sort of a problem.
[26:41.620 --> 26:43.940]  That's how you know what those plants can take.
[26:43.940 --> 26:47.820]  Honestly, that's how I became an advanced skill level grower.
[26:47.820 --> 26:51.940]  I fucked a lot of things up just by experimenting and trying.
[26:51.940 --> 26:55.180]  And I understand that your plants are precious to you and that every plant counts and that
[26:55.180 --> 26:56.500]  you need that harvest.
[26:56.500 --> 27:01.220]  But if you want to take your grow to the next level, you may have to take some risks.
[27:01.220 --> 27:05.760]  It may cost you one or two plants, but that experience is invaluable.
[27:05.760 --> 27:10.300]  If you can take your crop from what did you say, average to probably below average to
[27:10.300 --> 27:14.940]  above average and fucking stellar, it may be worth killing two or three, maybe four
[27:14.940 --> 27:18.300]  or five plants just to see what they can take.
[27:18.300 --> 27:24.580]  Now another thing I want to talk about is you said you were using the Botanicare CNS17
[27:24.580 --> 27:25.580]  product line.
[27:25.580 --> 27:30.120]  I am going to open the Botanicare website and I'm going to open the nutrient calculator.
[27:30.120 --> 27:33.160]  They have a nutrient calculator right here on the website.
[27:33.160 --> 27:37.560]  And this allows me to punch in what type of base nutrients we're going to use.
[27:37.560 --> 27:41.320]  We're going to use the CNS17 bloom base nutrient.
[27:41.320 --> 27:43.440]  We're going to measure our product in milliliters.
[27:43.440 --> 27:47.840]  I'm going to type in that we have a one gallon reservoir just to keep this simple.
[27:47.840 --> 27:48.840]  It wants grow time.
[27:48.840 --> 27:50.440]  We're going to say we're going to grow for four weeks.
[27:50.440 --> 27:51.840]  We will bloom for nine weeks.
[27:51.840 --> 27:55.280]  This is just a hypothetical for the case of this podcast so I can give you some advice
[27:55.280 --> 27:56.280]  here.
[27:56.280 --> 28:02.480]  Now on the Botanicare website, on their official nutrient calculator, on the bloom phase for
[28:02.480 --> 28:11.000]  week one of flower, it is recommending that I use 13 milliliters of the CNS17 bloom nutrient.
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.720]  That is going to put my PPMs at 910.
[28:14.720 --> 28:21.160]  Now the next week, they increase that dosage to 17 milliliters per gallon.
[28:21.160 --> 28:24.940]  And that continues all the way through week eight.
[28:25.100 --> 28:34.180]  Now if I correctly add 17 milliliters of CNS17 bloom base nutrients to my water, according
[28:34.180 --> 28:41.820]  to this feed chart, that is going to bring my PPMs to 1,190, which is very close to the
[28:41.820 --> 28:45.300]  1,200 number that you said you were ramping up to.
[28:45.300 --> 28:51.860]  Now Botanicare is recommending you start week two at 10 PPMs below where you are maxing
[28:51.860 --> 28:52.860]  out.
[28:52.860 --> 28:57.260]  Now this chart on this website is telling us that your PPMs of your base nutrients are
[28:57.260 --> 29:02.580]  way low and you need to increase your nutrient feedings of your plants earlier in the flowering
[29:02.580 --> 29:03.740]  phase.
[29:03.740 --> 29:08.820]  Now I do preach that these nutrient companies suggest you use more product than necessary
[29:08.820 --> 29:13.860]  so that they can sell you more, but they wouldn't suggest enough to blatantly burn your plants.
[29:13.860 --> 29:19.300]  So let's push it according to their chart and see how the plants react on their suggestion.
[29:19.300 --> 29:20.460]  Now I don't doubt your skills.
[29:20.460 --> 29:21.540]  I don't know who you are.
[29:21.540 --> 29:24.500]  I want to make this really simple for everybody.
[29:24.500 --> 29:31.620]  The way to achieve that specific PPM test in your nutrients is to start with clean water,
[29:31.620 --> 29:33.100]  water with zero PPMs.
[29:33.100 --> 29:34.300]  That is RO water.
[29:34.300 --> 29:38.020]  If you've got city tap water, there's going to be something in there already.
[29:38.020 --> 29:41.580]  Measure that, write down your baseline, see where you're starting.
[29:41.580 --> 29:46.220]  Then you have your amount of water, probably five gallons, maybe more depending on your
[29:46.220 --> 29:47.220]  situation.
[29:47.220 --> 29:49.260]  Put your PPM meter in there.
[29:49.260 --> 29:51.440]  Pour in that base nutrient and give it a stir.
[29:51.440 --> 29:53.000]  See what the meter says.
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.880]  If it doesn't say 1190, pour in a little more.
[29:55.880 --> 29:59.640]  Your goal is to get that PPMs to 1190.
[29:59.640 --> 30:04.640]  Once you've got your base nutrient at the correct PPMs, then add your additives at the
[30:04.640 --> 30:06.240]  recommended dosage.
[30:06.240 --> 30:09.720]  I would suggest you check the PPMs after you add each additive.
[30:09.720 --> 30:11.640]  So you've got your base nutrient in there.
[30:11.640 --> 30:12.640]  What are you going to add next?
[30:12.640 --> 30:13.680]  Maybe your cow mag.
[30:13.680 --> 30:17.520]  So measure out your two milliliters per gallon of cow mag and pour it in there.
[30:17.760 --> 30:22.600]  Put your PPM pin back in there, give it a swirl and write down what the PPMs are at
[30:22.600 --> 30:23.600]  this point.
[30:23.600 --> 30:28.320]  Now you know how many PPMs of cow mag are in your solution.
[30:28.320 --> 30:33.440]  Take the number that appears on your PPM meter and subtract 1190 because that is how much
[30:33.440 --> 30:34.880]  base nutrient we added.
[30:34.880 --> 30:39.200]  The remaining math is how much cow mag is in your solution.
[30:39.200 --> 30:41.480]  Continue this with all of your additives.
[30:41.480 --> 30:42.480]  Write it all down.
[30:42.480 --> 30:43.840]  Feed your plants.
[30:43.840 --> 30:47.320]  Pay attention over the next few days and see how they react.
[30:47.320 --> 30:49.200]  If the plants look angry, we fucked up.
[30:49.200 --> 30:52.320]  We need to reduce the nutrients, but now we know what they can take.
[30:52.320 --> 30:57.900]  If the plants explode with vigorous growth, we know we're on the right path to fixing
[30:57.900 --> 31:00.320]  your dissatisfaction.
[31:00.320 --> 31:04.220]  So if you haven't already, I suggest you head over to the Botanicare website and check out
[31:04.220 --> 31:07.320]  their nutrient calculator and play around with it a little bit.
[31:07.320 --> 31:12.560]  Put in the CNS-17 base and then see what it suggests you feed at each week.
[31:12.560 --> 31:14.680]  Then add a few things to the chart.
[31:14.680 --> 31:18.400]  And if you can afford a new product, I would recommend the Liquid Karma as the next thing
[31:18.400 --> 31:20.060]  you add to that lineup.
[31:20.060 --> 31:23.440]  Add that to your feed chart, see how much of it to mix in and add that right to your
[31:23.440 --> 31:24.440]  lineup.
[31:24.440 --> 31:27.720]  That will improve the quality of your finished product.
[31:27.720 --> 31:32.280]  And you guys, if you're not using Botanicare, most of the major nutrient companies will
[31:32.280 --> 31:35.840]  have a nutrient calculator on their website.
[31:35.840 --> 31:41.480]  Again, these companies do want us to buy more than necessary, so they may tell us to use
[31:41.480 --> 31:43.080]  a little bit extra.
[31:43.080 --> 31:45.520]  So follow the same advice that I gave our friend here.
[31:45.520 --> 31:50.720]  Start low, start with maybe 50 or 75% of the recommended dosage off the website, and then
[31:50.720 --> 31:54.460]  work your way up to 100% if you feel like the plants can take it.
[31:54.460 --> 31:58.940]  The reason I like those nutrient calculators is because it shows you the breakdown of what
[31:58.940 --> 32:02.980]  you can be feeding your garden, and it shows you correct ratios.
[32:02.980 --> 32:07.280]  You may not want to use every product on that chart, but it kind of gives you a ratio and
[32:07.280 --> 32:11.280]  shows you if you use this much of the base, let's just say if you use two parts of the
[32:11.280 --> 32:15.040]  base, you may want to use one part of this bloom booster and then a quarter part of this
[32:15.040 --> 32:16.040]  root inoculant.
[32:16.040 --> 32:17.700]  They just give you good ideas.
[32:17.700 --> 32:19.660]  It may suggest things you were missing.
[32:19.660 --> 32:24.400]  And I feel like it is a good baseline recipe for a new grower who is a little bit overwhelmed
[32:24.400 --> 32:29.000]  and confused by starting a brand new nutrient regimen.
[32:29.000 --> 32:33.280]  Now I hope that helps you improve the quality of your finished product.
[32:33.280 --> 32:38.040]  Don't be afraid to burn a couple of plants for the sake of overall improvement.
[32:38.040 --> 32:39.760]  I want to thank you guys for the great emails.
