[00:13.820 --> 00:15.780]  Thanks for taking some time out of the evening,

[00:17.300 --> 00:18.500]  and doing a podcast with me.
[00:18.500 --> 00:21.940]  I do appreciate it and the listeners appreciate it as well.

[00:58.940 --> 00:59.780]  All right.
[00:59.780 --> 01:01.460]  Hey Mike, what are you smoking on today, bro?
[01:02.660 --> 01:06.340]  Right now I've got some apothecary as per usual.
[01:06.340 --> 01:08.780]  I haven't been shopping in a couple of days.
[01:08.780 --> 01:10.740]  The last time you went, you really went in.
[01:10.740 --> 01:12.500]  So you don't need to shop for a few days, bro.
[01:12.500 --> 01:15.620]  Settle the fuck down, leave some for the other people.
[01:15.620 --> 01:19.060]  The lemon G is what I've hit most recently.
[01:19.060 --> 01:22.900]  And it's a little runny as per usual,
[01:22.900 --> 01:24.900]  but it's so wonderful.
[01:24.900 --> 01:26.380]  It's always runny, but I like it.
[01:26.380 --> 01:27.580]  I'm happy to chase it.
[01:27.580 --> 01:28.980]  Like it can run all it wants to.
[01:28.980 --> 01:30.860]  You gotta get like a spoonie type dabber
[01:30.860 --> 01:31.980]  and get it on there.
[01:31.980 --> 01:32.820]  It tastes so good.
[01:32.820 --> 01:34.060]  And the high when I smoke it,
[01:34.060 --> 01:35.420]  I'm just talking over your dab now,
[01:35.420 --> 01:37.140]  but I love it because it makes me like
[01:37.140 --> 01:39.780]  full fucking psychedelic goofball mode.
[01:39.780 --> 01:40.620]  I'm like, what's going on?
[01:40.620 --> 01:41.780]  I don't know what is happening.
[01:41.780 --> 01:42.620]  Like a good 20 or 30.
[01:42.620 --> 01:45.620]  I am a little giggly right now, not gonna lie.
[01:45.620 --> 01:47.420]  It might be a ramble cast folks.
[01:47.420 --> 01:48.460]  We're in with that.
[01:48.460 --> 01:50.460]  You said a moment ago that if you take another dab,
[01:50.460 --> 01:51.420]  it should be Indica.
[01:51.420 --> 01:52.620]  And I was like, well, let's record then.
[01:53.340 --> 01:54.660]  Because that means they're going to be chatty and talkative.
[01:54.660 --> 01:55.500]  I dig that.
[01:56.340 --> 01:58.260]  All right, Mike, they didn't mean to interrupt you there.
[01:58.260 --> 01:59.780]  Coughing in your face and talking over you
[01:59.780 --> 02:01.220]  when I'm talking about your dab.
[02:01.220 --> 02:04.020]  I love that lemon G, but today I am dabbing
[02:04.020 --> 02:06.420]  crescendo live batter from green dot labs.
[02:06.420 --> 02:09.620]  I was talking about the crescendo on a previous episode.
[02:09.620 --> 02:13.100]  This is the chem D I-95 and Mandarin cookies.
[02:13.100 --> 02:14.860]  I have to hold the jar just right.
[02:14.860 --> 02:15.980]  Cause it's added though.
[02:15.980 --> 02:17.340]  The way that it's printed, you can't read it.
[02:17.340 --> 02:18.780]  Looking at it straight on it blends in.
[02:18.780 --> 02:20.860]  You have to go to an angle and then the font sticks out.
[02:20.860 --> 02:21.820]  So that's why it looked like a,
[02:21.820 --> 02:24.100]  like grandma trying to adjust my bifocals over here.
[02:24.100 --> 02:26.220]  Let me just read this label.
[02:26.220 --> 02:28.060]  Anyway, on the package it says,
[02:28.060 --> 02:31.620]  the flavor should taste like a heavy chem,
[02:31.620 --> 02:34.140]  gas and cookie dough.
[02:34.140 --> 02:35.420]  I agree with all of that.
[02:36.620 --> 02:38.380]  When I first opened the jar, it's cookie dough.
[02:38.380 --> 02:39.300]  It's sweet.
[02:39.300 --> 02:42.340]  It's a vanilla cookie dough, chocolate chip cookie dough.
[02:42.340 --> 02:45.180]  Maybe like those toll house cookies that mama used to make.
[02:45.180 --> 02:46.340]  Smell real nice.
[02:47.540 --> 02:48.460]  Then when you hit it,
[02:48.500 --> 02:51.460]  that's when the gassy chem comes in, or for me, at least.
[02:51.460 --> 02:52.700]  The gas and the chem.
[02:52.700 --> 02:54.780]  And then after you exhale, it's just that chem on your tongue.
[02:54.780 --> 02:56.140]  It's like chem and sweetness.
[02:56.140 --> 02:57.100]  It's really nice.
[02:57.100 --> 02:59.180]  I can show the batter to the camera.
[02:59.180 --> 03:00.420]  Oh man, sadness.
[03:00.420 --> 03:02.860]  There's one dab left in there, except I'm going at it.
[03:02.860 --> 03:04.020]  But that's what we got left.
[03:04.020 --> 03:06.220]  The last dab in this jar.
[03:06.220 --> 03:09.100]  Of the crescendo live batter from our friends
[03:09.100 --> 03:11.100]  at green dot labs.
[03:11.100 --> 03:12.020]  It gets me nice and stoned.
[03:12.020 --> 03:12.860]  I really dig it.
[03:12.860 --> 03:13.700]  Nice indica punch.
[03:13.700 --> 03:15.580]  It like makes me mellow, but it also gets me talkative.
[03:15.580 --> 03:16.860]  So it's really a nice product.
[03:16.860 --> 03:18.220]  You guys will see when I tip this jar,
[03:18.860 --> 03:20.620]  how the font disappears.
[03:20.620 --> 03:21.460]  You see that?
[03:21.460 --> 03:22.620]  That's crazy.
[03:22.620 --> 03:23.860]  I don't think they do that on purpose.
[03:23.860 --> 03:25.940]  I just think that's an effect that happened on accident.
[03:25.940 --> 03:28.260]  But digging this concentrate, good shit.
[03:28.260 --> 03:30.500]  I can't wait to hit that very last dab.
[03:32.420 --> 03:33.500]  Where are we gonna go from there, Mike?
[03:33.500 --> 03:35.420]  Let's do the part of the show where we give shout outs
[03:35.420 --> 03:38.220]  to the friends who support us on Patreon.
[03:38.220 --> 03:39.500]  Shout outs.
[03:39.500 --> 03:41.500]  Usually I roll up big fat digital joints
[03:41.500 --> 03:44.860]  or pack up digital bong loads or scoop up some digital dabs
[03:44.860 --> 03:46.140]  and I send them out individually.
[03:46.140 --> 03:47.420]  That eats up so much time.
[03:47.460 --> 03:49.620]  So we're not gonna do that.
[03:49.620 --> 03:52.540]  I'm just gonna say big dab to all of our friends.
[03:52.540 --> 03:53.660]  Let's start off with a big shout out
[03:53.660 --> 03:55.780]  to my buddy Nick dude out there in Maine.
[03:55.780 --> 03:58.340]  Also a big shout out to my buddy Papa Roney.
[03:58.340 --> 04:01.300]  We may have an email coming up from our buddy Papa Roney.
[04:01.300 --> 04:03.100]  I also wanna send a giant shout out to my buddy,
[04:03.100 --> 04:06.700]  the THC Activator and his buddy G Farms 401.
[04:06.700 --> 04:07.540]  Big shout out boys.
[04:07.540 --> 04:08.900]  Thank you for all of the support.
[04:08.900 --> 04:10.940]  Thanks for teaming up, throwing down on the Patreon
[04:10.940 --> 04:11.900]  and getting us moving.
[04:11.900 --> 04:13.700]  If you've got any questions, let me know.
[04:13.700 --> 04:15.860]  I also wanna send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[04:15.900 --> 04:18.060]  Shout out to my buddy Dan, the Indoor Man.
[04:18.060 --> 04:20.380]  Always showing us love, always being a good dude.
[04:20.380 --> 04:21.220]  Thank you, bro.
[04:21.220 --> 04:22.300]  Appreciate your support.
[04:22.300 --> 04:24.780]  I also got a giant shout out for my friend Lefty's Farm.
[04:24.780 --> 04:27.100]  I've always got a giant shout out for Learning and Burning.
[04:27.100 --> 04:29.980]  Those are two of my favorite things, Learning and Burning.
[04:29.980 --> 04:31.100]  It doesn't get any better than that.
[04:31.100 --> 04:33.300]  Always be learning, always be burning.
[04:33.300 --> 04:34.820]  And last but certainly not least,
[04:34.820 --> 04:38.540]  I've got a giant shout out for my friend, Callie Canopy.
[04:38.540 --> 04:40.660]  Big thanks, big shout out, big fat dab
[04:40.660 --> 04:42.740]  for everybody who supports the show.
[04:42.740 --> 04:44.500]  If you would like to learn how to support the show

[04:54.740 --> 04:57.260]  to make it easy for my stoned friends.
[04:57.260 --> 04:59.260]  And also, Mike, would you like to remind them

[05:01.780 --> 05:05.260]  You can check me out at patreon.com slash white Mike.
[05:05.260 --> 05:06.100]  There you go.
[05:06.100 --> 05:08.140]  Can we turn up your mic just a little tiny bit, bro?
[05:08.140 --> 05:09.340]  Just a little bit.
[05:09.340 --> 05:10.380]  I will still get you dialed in.
[05:10.380 --> 05:11.500]  You're just a little bit quiet tonight.
[05:11.500 --> 05:13.540]  I don't know if you're talking quiet to keep the kids mellow
[05:13.580 --> 05:14.820]  but we gotta get you a little hotter
[05:14.820 --> 05:16.340]  or my mic is booming.
[05:16.340 --> 05:19.060]  The big knob, just a little bit more.
[05:19.060 --> 05:19.900]  You'll be all right.
[05:19.900 --> 05:21.220]  You won't fuck anything up.
[05:21.220 --> 05:22.260]  How does that sound?
[05:22.260 --> 05:23.100]  Oh, way better.
[05:23.100 --> 05:23.940]  There we go.
[05:23.940 --> 05:24.780]  I can tell you're still on the side of the mic.
[05:24.780 --> 05:25.620]  I can hear you.
[05:25.620 --> 05:26.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:26.460 --> 05:27.300]  I just wanna make sure.
[05:27.300 --> 05:28.420]  Yeah, there we go.
[05:28.420 --> 05:29.260]  How's that?
[05:29.260 --> 05:30.100]  That better?
[05:30.100 --> 05:31.340]  Now you're keeping up with me.
[05:31.340 --> 05:32.180]  Yeah, now you got better.
[05:32.180 --> 05:33.020]  There we go.
[05:33.020 --> 05:33.860]  There we go.
[05:33.860 --> 05:34.700]  Excellent.
[05:34.700 --> 05:35.540]  You guys, we're still getting it dialed in.
[05:35.540 --> 05:37.620]  Thank you for joining us for another Zoom podcast.
[05:37.620 --> 05:39.660]  Mike is learning how to be a sound engineer.
[05:39.660 --> 05:40.740]  He's getting fucking good at it.
[05:40.740 --> 05:42.700]  He just learned how to turn himself up.
[05:43.700 --> 05:46.500]  What else do we need to do in this part of the show, Mike?
[05:46.500 --> 05:47.700]  We've talked about your Patreon.
[05:47.700 --> 05:49.980]  We've told them what we're smoking.
[05:49.980 --> 05:50.820]  Everything good, bro?
[05:50.820 --> 05:51.700]  Anything you wanna cover
[05:51.700 --> 05:54.380]  before we get to the email portion of the podcast?
[05:55.780 --> 05:57.020]  Everything's grand, man.
[05:57.020 --> 05:58.460]  Everything is grand.
[05:58.460 --> 06:01.500]  I don't wanna dwell too much on the COVID-19 situation.
[06:01.500 --> 06:04.220]  We are recording at the end of April.
[06:05.140 --> 06:05.980]  What is it?
[06:05.980 --> 06:06.820]  29th, the very end of April.
[06:06.820 --> 06:09.900]  April 29th, 2020, 2020.
[06:09.900 --> 06:12.860]  Just in case you're listening way in the future.
[06:12.860 --> 06:17.540]  We are a month and a few days into the quarantine situation.
[06:17.540 --> 06:18.900]  I'm getting fuzzy.
[06:18.900 --> 06:19.900]  I haven't shaved in a minute.
[06:19.900 --> 06:22.300]  Mike is on a no shave.
[06:22.300 --> 06:24.860]  Yeah, if you're wondering,
[06:24.860 --> 06:28.220]  I'm growing the world's worst pandemic beard, viewers.
[06:29.380 --> 06:30.460]  It qualifies, bro.
[06:30.460 --> 06:31.300]  I said in a previous episode.
[06:31.300 --> 06:32.340]  That's fucking horrible.
[06:32.340 --> 06:33.420]  You look like the guy where they tried
[06:33.420 --> 06:35.260]  to put the magnet beard on him.
[06:35.260 --> 06:39.460]  I'm growing it in solidarity with my brother
[06:39.460 --> 06:42.700]  whose wife convinced him to grow one.
[06:43.580 --> 06:46.380]  The dig of the day was,
[06:46.380 --> 06:51.060]  his beard's shitty, but my beard is way worse.
[06:51.060 --> 06:53.380]  So he feels a lot better about his.
[06:53.380 --> 06:54.740]  There you go.
[06:54.740 --> 06:56.860]  Your son's beard is almost as thick as yours.
[06:56.860 --> 06:58.340]  It finally got soft today.
[06:58.340 --> 07:01.220]  So the kids have relented and then you have to shave
[07:01.220 --> 07:02.660]  to like, well, it doesn't hurt now.
[07:02.660 --> 07:04.020]  So.
[07:04.020 --> 07:07.380]  How long until the wife overrides this solidarity move?
[07:07.380 --> 07:09.180]  It's gonna be much longer.
[07:09.180 --> 07:11.300]  Yeah, I can see that coming up.
[07:11.300 --> 07:12.140]  I can see that.
[07:12.540 --> 07:13.380]  That's what's happening.
[07:13.380 --> 07:14.220]  We've been locked down so long.
[07:14.220 --> 07:16.260]  We're talking about beards and shit.
[07:16.260 --> 07:18.940]  We haven't been, we're not supposed to leave our houses
[07:18.940 --> 07:20.540]  unless we're doing essential business,
[07:20.540 --> 07:23.100]  which includes dispensaries and grocery stores.
[07:23.100 --> 07:24.660]  And that's about it really.
[07:24.660 --> 07:26.220]  That's all we really need to do.
[07:26.220 --> 07:28.540]  The other crazy thing that just happened,
[07:29.860 --> 07:31.500]  yesterday or the day before,
[07:31.500 --> 07:34.420]  the Pentagon released UFO footage.
[07:35.540 --> 07:37.940]  And if you guys haven't seen it,
[07:37.940 --> 07:39.980]  go check it out and then ask yourself
[07:39.980 --> 07:41.660]  why it got released now.
[07:42.980 --> 07:45.420]  I've seen that there is UFO footage,
[07:45.420 --> 07:48.380]  but I have not watched the actual UFO footage
[07:48.380 --> 07:52.500]  because I don't know, I'm so skeptical.
[07:52.500 --> 07:53.380]  So I didn't watch it.
[07:53.380 --> 07:54.780]  I thought it had to be fake.
[07:54.780 --> 07:56.620]  I didn't realize it was actually the Pentagon
[07:56.620 --> 07:57.900]  that released that when I saw it
[07:57.900 --> 08:00.140]  because anybody can make a UFO video.
[08:00.140 --> 08:00.980]  I can do it.
[08:00.980 --> 08:02.460]  I've got the gear right here in front of me.
[08:02.460 --> 08:04.940]  Yeah, I saw a post about it and I was like,
[08:04.940 --> 08:06.340]  oh, what's the onion up to now?
[08:06.340 --> 08:11.100]  And I clicked on it and I was like, NBC, huh?
[08:11.100 --> 08:12.060]  Wow.
[08:12.820 --> 08:14.460]  Pentagon, that's weird.
[08:14.460 --> 08:16.940]  So yeah, there was alien footage or UFO footage.
[08:16.940 --> 08:17.780]  I shouldn't say alien.
[08:17.780 --> 08:19.260]  That's a way different story.
[08:19.260 --> 08:20.740]  There was UFO footage.
[08:20.740 --> 08:21.980]  And I agree with you, bro.
[08:21.980 --> 08:24.540]  You hinted that it may be released for, with a reason.
[08:24.540 --> 08:26.380]  I think they're just trying to distract us
[08:26.380 --> 08:27.380]  and do weird shit.
[08:28.820 --> 08:30.540]  I keep saying they, I gotta quit saying they.
[08:30.540 --> 08:31.940]  If you don't know their email address,
[08:31.940 --> 08:33.020]  they aren't real people.
[08:33.020 --> 08:35.660]  He's a motherfucker, I'll tell you that.
[08:35.660 --> 08:36.500]  They're watching.
[08:36.500 --> 08:38.380]  They're into all kinds of shit.
[08:40.220 --> 08:41.300]  All right, I'm gonna be the conductor
[08:41.340 --> 08:43.100]  that puts this motherfucking train back on some rails.
[08:43.100 --> 08:44.380]  I was gonna say, this is an email show.
[08:44.380 --> 08:46.500]  We should probably get to an email.
[08:46.500 --> 08:47.420]  Well, we said in the beginning
[08:47.420 --> 08:48.940]  that you took a couple too many dabs,
[08:48.940 --> 08:50.860]  so we're gonna be all right.
[08:50.860 --> 08:53.460]  But first, yeah, but first we're gonna ramble for hours.
[08:53.460 --> 08:55.340]  In this episode, we are going to read a couple of emails.
[08:55.340 --> 08:57.020]  So let's segue into that portion of the show.
[08:57.020 --> 08:58.820]  I'm gonna grab an email off of the stack
[08:58.820 --> 09:00.340]  of emails over here.
[09:00.340 --> 09:01.420]  If you would like to send me an email,
[09:01.420 --> 09:04.500]  my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[09:04.500 --> 09:05.340]  I'd love to hear from you.
[09:05.340 --> 09:07.700]  I do love reading listener emails on the show.
[09:07.700 --> 09:09.500]  That lets me know I'm helping at least one person,
[09:09.500 --> 09:10.980]  at least this person right here.
[09:11.660 --> 09:12.500]  I'm sure if they're gonna get some help,
[09:12.500 --> 09:13.340]  I'm sure if they've got the question,
[09:13.340 --> 09:15.100]  more people probably do as well.
[09:15.100 --> 09:17.260]  So let's quit rambling and focus in.
[09:17.260 --> 09:20.340]  This question goes a lot like this.
[09:20.340 --> 09:22.500]  Hey, Rasta Jeff, I've got a question for you.
[09:22.500 --> 09:25.340]  Might be a show subject to touch on if you feel the need.
[09:25.340 --> 09:26.980]  Obviously it qualifies.
[09:26.980 --> 09:29.580]  It says my pH pens are not near the top of the line,
[09:29.580 --> 09:31.740]  but I believe when I mix in mycochum
[09:31.740 --> 09:35.220]  or anything that's sort of thick, it jacks my pens up.
[09:35.220 --> 09:37.380]  I let them sit in distilled water overnight.
[09:37.380 --> 09:38.220]  That is a mistake.
[09:38.220 --> 09:39.620]  They should not sit in distilled water.
[09:39.620 --> 09:42.020]  If you read the instructions on your pH meter,
[09:42.020 --> 09:43.940]  it says not to set it in distilled water.
[09:43.940 --> 09:46.260]  You want some type of water with minerals
[09:46.260 --> 09:47.900]  and nutrients in there.
[09:47.900 --> 09:49.580]  That way it doesn't kill the probe.
[09:49.580 --> 09:51.140]  I don't understand exactly how that works,
[09:51.140 --> 09:52.540]  but you want something in there.
[09:52.540 --> 09:54.400]  They actually sell a solution,
[09:54.400 --> 09:57.720]  which they recommend you leave your meters in overnight
[09:57.720 --> 09:58.700]  or over time.
[09:58.700 --> 09:59.820]  If it's the kind with the cap,
[09:59.820 --> 10:00.900]  you just put enough in the cap,
[10:00.900 --> 10:02.420]  you close the cap up and it stays in there.
[10:02.420 --> 10:05.020]  It keeps the node, the probe, it keeps it moist.
[10:05.020 --> 10:06.460]  So don't keep it in distilled water.
[10:06.460 --> 10:07.740]  That is a mistake.
[10:07.740 --> 10:10.020]  I'm gonna keep reading, where was I?
[10:11.660 --> 10:12.900]  Because they get used daily,
[10:12.900 --> 10:15.340]  but I seem to never get them calibrated correctly
[10:15.340 --> 10:16.260]  after two weeks.
[10:16.260 --> 10:19.260]  Yes, because you have left them in the wrong water.
[10:19.260 --> 10:20.300]  So they're messing up.
[10:20.300 --> 10:23.620]  Do you have any tips that could make my life easier on that?
[10:23.620 --> 10:25.100]  First off, you said that they mess up
[10:25.100 --> 10:27.140]  when you mix in mycochum.
[10:27.140 --> 10:28.220]  Yeah, clean the shit out of them.
[10:28.220 --> 10:29.740]  You gotta pull it right out of the mycochum
[10:29.740 --> 10:31.260]  and while that shit is still drippy,
[10:31.260 --> 10:32.740]  go into a container of clean water
[10:32.740 --> 10:34.140]  and shake the shit out of it
[10:34.140 --> 10:35.220]  and make sure you've got it clean
[10:35.220 --> 10:36.580]  and clean it once a week.
[10:36.580 --> 10:37.660]  When you're calibrating it,
[10:37.660 --> 10:39.340]  also clean the shit out of it.
[10:39.340 --> 10:40.940]  Make sure it is super clean.
[10:40.940 --> 10:42.980]  And I think we already touched on the main issue here,
[10:42.980 --> 10:44.220]  not storing it properly.
[10:44.220 --> 10:46.060]  It's being stored in distilled water.
[10:46.060 --> 10:49.060]  Most of the manufacturer packages will say not to do that.
[10:49.060 --> 10:50.980]  So that is probably what's fucking you up.
[10:50.980 --> 10:52.460]  Make your life easier.
[10:52.460 --> 10:53.780]  Read the fucking book, dude.
[10:53.780 --> 10:56.100]  RTFM, read the fucking manual.
[10:56.100 --> 10:56.980]  Just being a smart ass,
[10:56.980 --> 10:59.300]  but that probably would have saved you in the beginning.
[10:59.300 --> 11:00.260]  That would have taught you a lot of stuff.
[11:00.260 --> 11:02.420]  The guy at the grocery store should have given you a hint.
[11:02.420 --> 11:03.780]  At the grocery store,
[11:03.780 --> 11:05.740]  they like to tell you if it dries, it dies.
[11:05.740 --> 11:08.020]  He should have hinted that at you.
[11:08.020 --> 11:10.340]  You know, he should have, but he didn't.
[11:10.340 --> 11:11.940]  So I apologize.
[11:11.940 --> 11:12.780]  You say also-
[11:12.780 --> 11:13.740]  At the grocery store, they don't tell you that
[11:13.740 --> 11:15.700]  till you're buying your third one.
[11:15.700 --> 11:17.700]  Yeah, they want you to keep coming back and getting them.
[11:17.700 --> 11:19.300]  That is the truth.
[11:19.300 --> 11:20.140]  It goes on to say,
[11:20.140 --> 11:22.060]  I also feel that these pens are the most important tool
[11:22.060 --> 11:23.020]  in a grow period.
[11:23.020 --> 11:24.940]  So do you have any advice on a good brand
[11:24.940 --> 11:26.580]  that's not going to break me,
[11:26.580 --> 11:29.020]  that is also dependable and can hold up for a while
[11:29.020 --> 11:31.860]  without having to calibrate constantly?
[11:31.860 --> 11:33.780]  The calibrate constantly thing,
[11:33.780 --> 11:35.420]  I like calibrating my gear.
[11:36.100 --> 11:37.260]  I want to calibrate it at least once a week.
[11:37.260 --> 11:39.620]  Then I know it's some peace of mind.
[11:39.620 --> 11:41.980]  It's like giving people a driving test.
[11:41.980 --> 11:43.300]  There's no one that they could still drive.
[11:43.300 --> 11:44.820]  It's like giving old people a vision test
[11:44.820 --> 11:45.660]  before you let them drive.
[11:45.660 --> 11:46.700]  Can you still see?
[11:46.700 --> 11:47.980]  If not, we can't let you on the road
[11:47.980 --> 11:49.260]  and they can still see you and put you back.
[11:49.260 --> 11:51.260]  Is that fucking pH meter qualified?
[11:51.260 --> 11:52.660]  I need it to work.
[11:52.660 --> 11:53.620]  In my situation,
[11:53.620 --> 11:56.340]  I'm in charge of multimillion dollar facilities sometimes
[11:56.340 --> 11:59.300]  and I can't mess up the pH for millions of dollars a plant.
[11:59.300 --> 12:01.460]  So I need quality gear.
[12:01.460 --> 12:03.500]  I calibrate it once a week.
[12:03.500 --> 12:04.740]  Mike is watching me do it.
[12:04.780 --> 12:06.580]  Mike is watching me teach the crew how to do it.
[12:06.580 --> 12:07.580]  Mike has probably stood there
[12:07.580 --> 12:09.660]  and waited for me to calibrate pins before.
[12:09.660 --> 12:11.940]  I've helped people throw away crops
[12:11.940 --> 12:14.900]  killed by improperly calibrated gear.
[12:14.900 --> 12:15.740]  Yep.
[12:15.740 --> 12:18.380]  I've helped them trash and replant.
[12:18.380 --> 12:19.220]  So.
[12:20.220 --> 12:24.060]  Then this person asks for quality gear that I can recommend.
[12:24.060 --> 12:25.620]  I'm not paid by anybody.
[12:25.620 --> 12:27.580]  And it seems like anytime I recommend a brand,
[12:27.580 --> 12:29.460]  I get 12 emails telling me
[12:29.460 --> 12:31.380]  that I suck for recommending a certain brand
[12:31.380 --> 12:32.260]  and that I'm wrong.
[12:32.260 --> 12:33.460]  I'm gonna tell you what I buy.
[12:33.500 --> 12:35.660]  I'm going to tell you what I use and what works for me.
[12:35.660 --> 12:36.980]  They don't pay me.
[12:36.980 --> 12:39.940]  This is just from experience and financial.
[12:39.940 --> 12:41.020]  It fits the budget.
[12:41.020 --> 12:43.820]  I like the Blue Lab three-in-one combo meter.
[12:43.820 --> 12:45.580]  It tells me my EC, my pH,
[12:45.580 --> 12:47.380]  and my temperature of my solution
[12:47.380 --> 12:48.420]  with two different probes.
[12:48.420 --> 12:50.820]  I stick them in there and I get three different readings.
[12:50.820 --> 12:52.660]  If you've got a large reservoir,
[12:52.660 --> 12:53.860]  you can screw it to the wall.
[12:53.860 --> 12:54.700]  It takes batteries.
[12:54.700 --> 12:56.300]  So you gotta be able to get it off the wall occasionally
[12:56.300 --> 12:57.700]  to put the batteries in and out.
[12:57.700 --> 12:58.900]  The batteries go in the back.
[12:58.900 --> 13:00.220]  So put batteries in it,
[13:00.220 --> 13:01.060]  screw it to the wall,
[13:01.060 --> 13:03.100]  then you can drop those probes right in your reservoir
[13:03.100 --> 13:05.220]  and they'll just be in the reservoir at all times.
[13:05.220 --> 13:06.300]  You've got a reading.
[13:06.300 --> 13:07.340]  When you push the button,
[13:07.340 --> 13:08.740]  it'll show you your pH is this,
[13:08.740 --> 13:09.660]  your temperature is this,
[13:09.660 --> 13:11.780]  your PPMs or EC is this,
[13:11.780 --> 13:13.380]  and it'll show you right on the screen.
[13:13.380 --> 13:16.140]  So I really like the Blue Lab three-in-one combo meter.
[13:16.140 --> 13:17.340]  It's a little pricey,
[13:17.340 --> 13:20.780]  but you only have to buy it once if you take care of it.
[13:20.780 --> 13:22.060]  Sorry, I was trying not to cough into the mic.
[13:22.060 --> 13:23.260]  I've got the coughs from the dabs.
[13:23.260 --> 13:25.300]  It's how fucking cannabis podcast goes,
[13:25.300 --> 13:27.980]  but I recommend that three-in-one combo meter.
[13:27.980 --> 13:29.460]  If you can't get the three-in-one,
[13:29.460 --> 13:31.780]  just get the Blue Lab pH meter.
[13:31.780 --> 13:34.060]  And then I also like to test the EC or the PPMs.
[13:34.060 --> 13:37.460]  You guys, I like to test the EC or the PPMs of the solution.
[13:37.460 --> 13:40.020]  I test the water before I put nutrients in it,
[13:40.020 --> 13:42.540]  and then I'll hold that PPH or the PM meter in there,
[13:42.540 --> 13:44.060]  and I'll pour in nutrients and stir it
[13:44.060 --> 13:45.660]  and see what it goes up with the first one
[13:45.660 --> 13:46.980]  and see what it goes up to the second one.
[13:46.980 --> 13:51.500]  I'll pay attention to the total PPMs or EC of my solution
[13:51.500 --> 13:52.980]  before I water it to my plants.
[13:52.980 --> 13:53.820]  And then when it runs off,
[13:53.820 --> 13:55.260]  I'll get enough of that solution
[13:55.260 --> 13:57.900]  and measure that solution as well and mark that down.
[13:57.900 --> 14:01.220]  So I'm marking down the pH and the EC of the solutions
[14:01.220 --> 14:03.060]  going in and out of my plants.
[14:03.060 --> 14:04.740]  I like to test the water a lot.
[14:04.740 --> 14:06.260]  You gotta know what's going on.
[14:06.260 --> 14:08.060]  Like those small variables
[14:08.060 --> 14:10.060]  will make huge differences in your crops.
[14:10.060 --> 14:11.620]  So that's something to think about,
[14:11.620 --> 14:12.500]  and we're gonna work on.
[14:12.500 --> 14:14.620]  Another question really helps us address that.
[14:14.620 --> 14:16.060]  Let me make sure I've got the right email up
[14:16.060 --> 14:17.180]  because that just made me think
[14:17.180 --> 14:19.460]  how great the next email would be for this.
[14:19.460 --> 14:21.660]  Just wanna make sure I got it up there.
[14:21.660 --> 14:22.500]  Yeah, I think I'm right.
[14:22.500 --> 14:23.980]  Okay, there is more to this one.
[14:23.980 --> 14:25.340]  I was just thinking ahead.
[14:25.340 --> 14:26.260]  It says, these bins are cheap.
[14:26.260 --> 14:27.100]  Recommend a good one.
[14:27.100 --> 14:28.180]  I did that for you.
[14:28.180 --> 14:30.260]  It says, like always, thank you for sharing your knowledge.
[14:30.260 --> 14:31.100]  You are very welcome.
[14:31.980 --> 14:32.820]  Thank you for listening to the show.
[14:32.820 --> 14:33.660]  Thank you for the great email.
[14:33.660 --> 14:35.980]  It says, your mix episodes have changed my style
[14:35.980 --> 14:38.380]  for the better and answered a lot of questions,
[14:38.380 --> 14:40.100]  which I have wondered about.
[14:40.100 --> 14:42.100]  Signed, I'm not gonna read their name
[14:42.100 --> 14:43.500]  because it doesn't say if I can or not.
[14:43.500 --> 14:44.420]  They know who they are.
[14:44.420 --> 14:45.740]  They're huge supporters of the show.
[14:45.740 --> 14:47.260]  They've been around for quite a while.
[14:47.260 --> 14:48.820]  They're friends and family now.
[14:48.820 --> 14:50.180]  Dude, thank you for the great message.
[14:50.180 --> 14:51.620]  Get that pen calibrated.
[14:51.620 --> 14:53.780]  If it doesn't show the little check mark
[14:53.780 --> 14:54.620]  when you calibrate it,
[14:54.620 --> 14:56.100]  it's time to get a new fucking meter, bro.
[14:56.100 --> 14:57.660]  You may have let that thing die.
[14:57.660 --> 15:00.540]  You may have let it dry, and it is rest in peace.
[15:00.980 --> 15:02.140]  You may be able to send it back to Blue Lab
[15:02.140 --> 15:04.220]  so they can recycle it, make another meter out of it
[15:04.220 --> 15:05.820]  so you don't have to put it in the landfill.
[15:05.820 --> 15:07.980]  Maybe contact them for that, or whatever company it is.
[15:07.980 --> 15:08.980]  It's not a Blue Lab,
[15:08.980 --> 15:10.420]  because you said it's a piece of junk.
[15:10.420 --> 15:11.820]  I bet it's one of those yellow ones,
[15:11.820 --> 15:14.180]  and we're not gonna say the name of that company.
[15:14.180 --> 15:15.380]  Dude, thank you for the great message.
[15:15.380 --> 15:16.420]  Mike knows what I'm talking about.
[15:16.420 --> 15:17.660]  He watched all the new growers
[15:17.660 --> 15:19.740]  get those little yellow ones at the store.
[15:19.740 --> 15:22.140]  They just die, die, die.
[15:22.140 --> 15:24.100]  And if you don't like the pH, yeah.
[15:24.100 --> 15:26.300]  If you don't like the pH meter I recommended, that's cool.
[15:26.300 --> 15:28.100]  Recommend a good one to me, and I'll do research,
[15:28.100 --> 15:29.500]  and I'll see if it's good, and if I like it,
[15:29.540 --> 15:31.580]  maybe we will also recommend that
[15:31.580 --> 15:33.180]  to our friends on the show.
[15:33.180 --> 15:34.020]  I just told you.
[15:34.020 --> 15:36.020]  If you've got a pH pen you want somebody to test,
[15:36.020 --> 15:37.340]  feel free to send us one.
[15:37.340 --> 15:38.940]  That's the truth, yeah.
[15:38.940 --> 15:42.460]  Email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[15:42.460 --> 15:45.460]  Now I know I said the next email would involve that,
[15:45.460 --> 15:47.420]  but I do have another one that comes up first,
[15:47.420 --> 15:49.180]  because we're gonna do it this way.
[15:49.180 --> 15:53.100]  This one comes from, again, it just says, cheers, my friend,
[15:53.100 --> 15:54.220]  and they signed it with an emoji,
[15:54.220 --> 15:56.580]  so it came up as just a square when I printed it.
[15:56.580 --> 15:58.660]  Probably a thumbs up, probably something like that.
[15:58.660 --> 16:00.500]  Hopefully it wasn't a middle finger.
[16:00.500 --> 16:01.700]  The message goes like this.
[16:01.700 --> 16:04.420]  It says, I am a cannabis grower and a cannabis consumer.
[16:04.420 --> 16:06.300]  I also grow for medical patients.
[16:06.300 --> 16:07.260]  I am retired.
[16:07.260 --> 16:08.900]  We know a lot about this person.
[16:08.900 --> 16:11.020]  I was searching the podcast app on my phone
[16:11.020 --> 16:13.260]  for cannabis growers, and I found a whole bunch
[16:13.260 --> 16:14.820]  of podcasts on the subject.
[16:14.820 --> 16:19.180]  Yes, there are a plethora of cannabis-related podcasts.
[16:19.180 --> 16:21.620]  The only problem is that I could not find one podcast
[16:21.620 --> 16:23.740]  that would catch my attention for me to stick around
[16:23.740 --> 16:26.180]  long enough except your show.
[16:26.180 --> 16:27.260]  That is awesome, man.
[16:27.260 --> 16:28.300]  Thank you.
[16:28.460 --> 16:31.820]  I learned more, so much more from you
[16:31.820 --> 16:34.500]  in just one day of listening than the whole month
[16:34.500 --> 16:36.380]  of listening to another podcast.
[16:36.380 --> 16:37.220]  That's fucking awesome.
[16:37.220 --> 16:38.060]  Thank you.
[16:38.060 --> 16:38.900]  I really try to be direct.
[16:38.900 --> 16:42.180]  I try to, I kind of dwell on one topic too long sometimes,
[16:42.180 --> 16:43.500]  but I try to make sure that everybody
[16:43.500 --> 16:44.660]  can absorb the information.
[16:44.660 --> 16:46.620]  Mike learns way differently than I do,
[16:46.620 --> 16:49.020]  differently than Matt does, differently than you do,
[16:49.020 --> 16:50.300]  so we all have our own way of learning.
[16:50.300 --> 16:52.380]  I try to put all those options out there on the table
[16:52.380 --> 16:54.020]  so you can see what I'm teaching,
[16:54.020 --> 16:56.220]  and I can paint the picture with different colors
[16:56.220 --> 16:57.660]  and make sure you get it from different angles.
[16:58.100 --> 16:58.940]  Thank you.
[16:58.940 --> 17:00.140]  I'm glad you appreciate the show,
[17:00.140 --> 17:01.260]  and I'm glad I keep your attention,
[17:01.260 --> 17:03.180]  because I've got ADD, and I know what it's like
[17:03.180 --> 17:04.820]  having a hard time getting attention.
[17:04.820 --> 17:05.900]  I'm glad I taught you a lot.
[17:05.900 --> 17:06.740]  There's more to it, though.
[17:06.740 --> 17:08.380]  It says, to be honest, at first I thought
[17:08.380 --> 17:10.140]  you were a talking robot.
[17:10.140 --> 17:10.980]  Yes, I am.
[17:10.980 --> 17:13.820]  This is Rasta Jeff, the robot, the grow drone.
[17:13.820 --> 17:16.180]  No, but really, I'm just a fucking charismatic dude
[17:16.180 --> 17:17.860]  that has a passion for cannabis.
[17:17.860 --> 17:19.580]  And then it says, as the more I listen,
[17:19.580 --> 17:21.140]  I realize that is not the case.
[17:21.140 --> 17:22.300]  Thank you, bro.
[17:22.300 --> 17:24.100]  It says your podcast is very informative,
[17:24.100 --> 17:25.780]  and I just wanted to say congratulations
[17:25.780 --> 17:27.340]  and keep up the good work.
[17:28.020 --> 17:30.380]  It says your Grow Room Safety episode was on point.
[17:30.380 --> 17:33.660]  I would like to see more info on safety in the grow
[17:33.660 --> 17:35.940]  pertaining to home growing.
[17:35.940 --> 17:37.300]  We can talk about that really quickly.
[17:37.300 --> 17:38.540]  I wasn't intending to cover that,
[17:38.540 --> 17:40.380]  but I wanted to get our friend's message in here.
[17:40.380 --> 17:41.900]  He's been waiting for a minute.
[17:42.860 --> 17:45.020]  A couple of quick things to think about home safety
[17:45.020 --> 17:45.860]  when you're growing.
[17:45.860 --> 17:48.020]  If you've got kids around, if you've got other people around,
[17:48.020 --> 17:50.740]  a lock on the fucking door is the first step.
[17:50.740 --> 17:52.220]  Then right outside of that door,
[17:52.220 --> 17:54.420]  a fire extinguisher is the next step.
[17:54.860 --> 17:55.700]  Nope.
[17:55.700 --> 17:58.940]  Then inside of that grow room, a smoke detector.
[17:58.940 --> 18:01.300]  That way, if you have a fire from a light, a fan,
[18:01.300 --> 18:03.580]  anything in there, it goes, beep, you run,
[18:03.580 --> 18:05.580]  you grab fire extinguisher, you kick open door
[18:05.580 --> 18:08.060]  and you go spray, spray, spray, you've saved the day.
[18:08.060 --> 18:10.380]  So those are probably the first three things
[18:10.380 --> 18:11.340]  I would think of.
[18:11.340 --> 18:13.260]  Then I would follow it up with a camera.
[18:13.260 --> 18:15.980]  If you can put some cameras in there on the perimeter,
[18:15.980 --> 18:18.340]  on the inside, cameras are awesome.
[18:18.340 --> 18:21.900]  Then I like a PL minder or some sort of a sensor unit
[18:21.900 --> 18:23.620]  that lets me know what's going on in there.
[18:23.620 --> 18:24.980]  There are several available.
[18:24.980 --> 18:27.220]  You guys know I work with PL grow dot systems,
[18:27.220 --> 18:28.380]  check them out.
[18:28.380 --> 18:31.180]  Use coupon code GFYH25 and save a few bucks
[18:31.180 --> 18:32.780]  if you get a PL minder unit.
[18:32.780 --> 18:34.020]  But I like something that lets me know
[18:34.020 --> 18:34.980]  what's going on in the grow.
[18:34.980 --> 18:36.220]  I can open up my phone.
[18:36.220 --> 18:38.420]  I've got two or three spaces that are registered
[18:38.420 --> 18:40.700]  to PL grow systems and I can see what's happening
[18:40.700 --> 18:41.700]  in there right now.
[18:41.700 --> 18:43.900]  I know the temperature, I know the relative humidity.
[18:43.900 --> 18:46.220]  I know if the lights are off, I know if the lights are on.
[18:46.220 --> 18:48.820]  I can, with those monitors, I can basically tell
[18:48.820 --> 18:50.620]  if somebody has opened the door or not
[18:50.620 --> 18:51.820]  within certain timeframes.
[18:51.860 --> 18:53.180]  Because when you open the door,
[18:53.180 --> 18:54.780]  the temperature and the humidity spike,
[18:54.780 --> 18:55.820]  things change in there.
[18:55.820 --> 18:57.580]  There are ups and downs when you open the door
[18:57.580 --> 18:58.420]  and I can see that.
[18:58.420 --> 18:59.860]  I know how long you were in there.
[18:59.860 --> 19:01.380]  And then also if I think you were in there,
[19:01.380 --> 19:03.780]  I can look at the camera and I can do the footage
[19:03.780 --> 19:05.300]  with the fucking PL minder unit.
[19:05.300 --> 19:07.020]  I can see, look, fucker, you left the door open
[19:07.020 --> 19:09.580]  from fucking three to five and here's how much CO2
[19:09.580 --> 19:10.620]  we wasted.
[19:10.620 --> 19:12.620]  Like I can see that kind of stuff on the monitor
[19:12.620 --> 19:13.620]  and the minder unit.
[19:13.620 --> 19:15.300]  So those are great tools.
[19:15.300 --> 19:16.900]  You can use them as security features.
[19:16.900 --> 19:18.060]  They also help you with the grow.
[19:18.060 --> 19:20.300]  So a door lock is number one.
[19:20.300 --> 19:22.020]  That's the first thing when it comes to safety,
[19:22.020 --> 19:23.460]  keep motherfuckers out of there.
[19:23.460 --> 19:25.420]  A smoke alarm, that way if something goes wrong,
[19:25.420 --> 19:26.940]  we know something went wrong.
[19:26.940 --> 19:29.500]  Then a fire extinguisher.
[19:29.500 --> 19:31.580]  Then some sort of excuse why your house smells
[19:31.580 --> 19:32.580]  like skunks all the time.
[19:32.580 --> 19:34.580]  It's probably another good security measure.
[19:34.580 --> 19:36.180]  Cameras are always a good thing.
[19:36.180 --> 19:38.300]  Professional power upgrades.
[19:38.300 --> 19:40.100]  Yeah, professional power upgrades.
[19:40.100 --> 19:41.300]  Don't do that yourself.
[19:42.260 --> 19:43.420]  Unless you're an electrician.
[19:43.420 --> 19:46.540]  But don't let me and Mike or Mike and I come
[19:46.540 --> 19:47.420]  wire up your house.
[19:47.420 --> 19:48.460]  It's not gonna work.
[19:48.460 --> 19:50.220]  Don't overload your breakers.
[19:51.020 --> 19:52.020]  That's always something to think about.
[19:52.020 --> 19:53.140]  And don't tell anybody.
[19:53.140 --> 19:55.980]  That's another important grow room safety tip.
[19:55.980 --> 19:58.500]  I didn't really plan a good grow room safety episode.
[19:58.500 --> 20:00.100]  Maybe I will make a note on this page
[20:00.100 --> 20:01.460]  to do a better episode on that.
[20:01.460 --> 20:03.300]  To do a safety episode too?
[20:03.300 --> 20:04.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[20:04.380 --> 20:06.060]  I'm gonna write safety.
[20:06.060 --> 20:08.380]  Yeah, this is just off the cuff.
[20:08.380 --> 20:10.100]  We did play the safety dance at the end of that.
[20:10.100 --> 20:11.340]  It's a pretty good basic list.
[20:11.340 --> 20:13.220]  Yeah, I just wanted to make sure to get our friends'
[20:13.220 --> 20:15.500]  email on the show and give them a shout out.
[20:15.500 --> 20:17.060]  He doesn't remember that episode now.
[20:17.060 --> 20:19.060]  Yeah, I played the safety dance at the end of that.
[20:19.060 --> 20:20.460]  I remember it as soon as I wrote safety.
[20:20.460 --> 20:22.260]  I was like, we played safety dance.
[20:22.260 --> 20:24.220]  Dude, thank you for the great message.
[20:24.220 --> 20:25.980]  I'm making sure we covered all of it.
[20:25.980 --> 20:26.820]  We did.
[20:26.820 --> 20:27.660]  So thank you.
[20:27.660 --> 20:29.900]  I hope I'm able to get another safety episode out for you.
[20:29.900 --> 20:32.700]  I hope a couple of quick tips help our listeners.
[20:32.700 --> 20:34.380]  Keep the great emails coming, my friend.
[20:34.380 --> 20:35.700]  I do appreciate it.
[20:35.700 --> 20:38.620]  Mike, I feel like we're going really fast in this episode.
[20:39.700 --> 20:40.900]  Just staying on point.
[20:40.900 --> 20:41.980]  Staying on point.
[20:41.980 --> 20:43.140]  All right, I took a couple of dabs.
[20:43.140 --> 20:44.780]  So I'm glad I'm staying on point.
[20:46.020 --> 20:47.300]  You wanna jump right into the next message
[20:47.300 --> 20:48.140]  or you got anything fancy to say?
[20:48.180 --> 20:48.980]  I'm just gonna say,
[20:48.980 --> 20:52.140]  I've been doing podcasts and dabbing for the past,
[20:52.140 --> 20:53.740]  fucking since 420, I haven't quit.
[20:53.740 --> 20:54.740]  I've been on this microphone.
[20:54.740 --> 20:56.060]  So my throat will live.
[20:56.060 --> 20:57.740]  It will catch on or it won't.
[20:57.740 --> 20:59.820]  We'll just have a throat-iotomy pretty soon.
[20:59.820 --> 21:01.660]  That last dab got me right in the nose.
[21:01.660 --> 21:03.660]  The lemon juice playing with my head.
[21:03.660 --> 21:04.500]  That's good for you.
[21:04.500 --> 21:05.660]  You've been a great podcast guest.
[21:05.660 --> 21:06.500]  You'll be just fine.
[21:06.500 --> 21:07.340]  You can hang out.
[21:07.340 --> 21:08.820]  You're not messing up anything too bad.
[21:10.580 --> 21:12.220]  This one comes from our friend Thor.
[21:12.220 --> 21:14.220]  And Thor says, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[21:14.220 --> 21:15.380]  If this makes it to the show,
[21:15.380 --> 21:16.740]  feel free to give me a shout out.
[21:16.780 --> 21:18.780]  My name is Thor from Prohibition Land.
[21:18.780 --> 21:20.860]  Big up bro, big Viking handshake.
[21:20.860 --> 21:21.940]  It says, anyways, man,
[21:21.940 --> 21:23.940]  I've been struggling with the water in my area.
[21:23.940 --> 21:24.980]  Since I started growing,
[21:24.980 --> 21:27.140]  I've been taking empty jugs of water
[21:27.140 --> 21:29.580]  for those glacier water vending machines at Walmart.
[21:29.580 --> 21:31.100]  It's a major pain in the ass.
[21:31.100 --> 21:33.860]  Yeah, and you're also gonna get noticed doing that.
[21:33.860 --> 21:35.940]  I was thinking of buying my own RO filter,
[21:35.940 --> 21:39.140]  but everyone says they're a big pain in the ass as well.
[21:39.140 --> 21:40.980]  They are, but they have come a long way.
[21:40.980 --> 21:42.940]  The technology has advanced a little bit.
[21:42.940 --> 21:44.620]  It says, I'm kind of at a loss here.
[21:44.620 --> 21:47.380]  I want good water that's not going to hurt my ladies.
[21:47.380 --> 21:49.180]  And I don't mind buying a good filter
[21:49.180 --> 21:51.300]  if I knew what exactly to buy.
[21:51.300 --> 21:53.260]  I know you said in Colorado, you have good water,
[21:53.260 --> 21:55.380]  but here in Texas, I'm not so sure.
[21:55.380 --> 21:57.380]  You got that Texas tea going on, bro.
[21:57.380 --> 21:58.980]  What kind of filters would you recommend
[21:58.980 --> 22:00.900]  to get the best results for my ladies?
[22:00.900 --> 22:01.900]  I love the podcast.
[22:01.900 --> 22:04.060]  I've learned so much from listening to your show
[22:04.060 --> 22:05.580]  and I appreciate all of the knowledge.
[22:05.580 --> 22:08.900]  Take a fat dab and give moms a hug for me.
[22:08.900 --> 22:10.900]  All right, Thor brings up a great point.
[22:10.900 --> 22:13.780]  Water is not the same in all municipalities.
[22:13.820 --> 22:15.420]  He has got some chunky water.
[22:15.420 --> 22:17.380]  He wants to make sure that water is clean.
[22:17.380 --> 22:20.340]  He's considering RO, but we do have to keep in mind,
[22:20.340 --> 22:21.660]  RO is quite wasteful.
[22:21.660 --> 22:23.780]  Much of the water we run through that machine,
[22:23.780 --> 22:24.660]  just, it is waste.
[22:24.660 --> 22:25.660]  It goes right down the drain.
[22:25.660 --> 22:26.500]  It is gray water.
[22:26.500 --> 22:29.180]  You can use it to like wash the car and scrub the floors,
[22:29.180 --> 22:30.060]  but you can't drink it.
[22:30.060 --> 22:32.620]  You wouldn't want to wash anything like yourself with it.
[22:32.620 --> 22:34.420]  So there's a little bit of waste.
[22:34.420 --> 22:38.500]  The technology has come a long way with RO filters.
[22:38.500 --> 22:41.940]  The problem you run into there is balancing pH
[22:41.940 --> 22:43.580]  and adjusting and buffering the water
[22:44.380 --> 22:45.900]  becomes more challenging when you don't have
[22:45.900 --> 22:47.580]  any solution in the water.
[22:48.900 --> 22:51.300]  So I wouldn't go directly to RO
[22:51.300 --> 22:53.660]  unless your water is completely nasty
[22:53.660 --> 22:55.820]  and you're running in hydroponics.
[22:55.820 --> 23:00.660]  What I would recommend is a big boy or a small boy filter.
[23:00.660 --> 23:04.020]  I think that that is the type of filter they use in an RV.
[23:04.020 --> 23:05.380]  And I think that those are good filters.
[23:05.380 --> 23:07.500]  They will work well to clean out whatever's in
[23:07.500 --> 23:11.140]  your municipal water to make it safe for your grow.
[23:11.140 --> 23:13.020]  If you really want to nerd out about it,
[23:13.460 --> 23:15.540]  you can get a test and see what is in the water
[23:15.540 --> 23:17.460]  and then see how much of that you want to remove.
[23:17.460 --> 23:20.780]  And you can get specific filtration for that water,
[23:20.780 --> 23:22.220]  but that's going to get expensive.
[23:22.220 --> 23:23.780]  The water test won't be expensive.
[23:23.780 --> 23:26.500]  You could probably ask the city what they put in it,
[23:26.500 --> 23:29.780]  but from the city down to the main pipe,
[23:29.780 --> 23:31.620]  to the other pipe, to the branch off pipe,
[23:31.620 --> 23:32.780]  to the neighborhood, fucking,
[23:32.780 --> 23:34.100]  I don't know what the tubes are called,
[23:34.100 --> 23:35.820]  the real names for where the water runs,
[23:35.820 --> 23:38.140]  but the pipes, every pipe is going to have
[23:38.140 --> 23:40.460]  some sort of sediment, some sort of buildup.
[23:40.460 --> 23:42.140]  You're going to get some other thing.
[23:42.180 --> 23:44.100]  By the time it goes from the plant to your,
[23:44.100 --> 23:46.980]  out to your sink, to your hose, it's got other shit in it.
[23:46.980 --> 23:48.940]  So you may want to check on a water test
[23:48.940 --> 23:50.900]  if you're really interested, see what's in there
[23:50.900 --> 23:53.100]  and then see exactly what filtration is required
[23:53.100 --> 23:54.460]  to move those elements.
[23:54.460 --> 23:55.900]  At that point, you may want to go RO
[23:55.900 --> 23:57.420]  if it's something real crazy.
[23:57.420 --> 24:00.460]  But I really think that a big boy or a small boy filter,
[24:00.460 --> 24:02.740]  that's what I use in a commercial cultivation environment.
[24:02.740 --> 24:04.300]  I don't do RO.
[24:04.300 --> 24:05.180]  Go ahead, Mike.
[24:05.180 --> 24:08.340]  Looks like water testing in Texas is pretty easy.
[24:08.340 --> 24:10.620]  Yeah, it should be easy in most places.
[24:10.620 --> 24:11.460]  Yep.
[24:14.430 --> 24:17.790]  That's all I got there is get your water tested
[24:17.790 --> 24:20.030]  and figure out exactly what you're trying to get out of it
[24:20.030 --> 24:21.990]  and then you'll know how to attack it.
[24:21.990 --> 24:23.470]  Yeah.
[24:23.470 --> 24:26.990]  I've seen some pretty gnarly water filters.
[24:26.990 --> 24:29.110]  Nasty goes in, good comes out.
[24:29.110 --> 24:29.950]  Yep.
[24:29.950 --> 24:31.470]  But then you have to think about how much waste
[24:31.470 --> 24:32.830]  and how much the filters cost
[24:32.830 --> 24:35.110]  and how often you need to change those filters.
[24:35.110 --> 24:37.870]  So a good start would be to check your pH and your PPMs
[24:37.870 --> 24:39.590]  with your new meters that we recommended
[24:39.590 --> 24:42.310]  to the last listener and then see what you're starting with.
[24:42.310 --> 24:43.790]  If you've got crazy PPMs in there,
[24:44.590 --> 24:45.430]  you may wanna take some shit out.
[24:45.430 --> 24:46.990]  If the plants are acting like they're not happy,
[24:46.990 --> 24:48.630]  you may wanna remove some stuff.
[24:48.630 --> 24:51.150]  So pay attention to the plants, see what's in there.
[24:51.150 --> 24:53.270]  If there's a lot of chloramine in things,
[24:53.270 --> 24:55.870]  the big boy and the RO, the big boy and the small boy
[24:55.870 --> 24:57.230]  aren't gonna take out chloramine.
[24:57.230 --> 24:59.870]  I think you're gonna have to use RO to get that out of there
[24:59.870 --> 25:02.350]  but that's what I would recommend is research
[25:02.350 --> 25:04.630]  what's in there and then decide what you need
[25:04.630 --> 25:06.390]  based on what's in there.
[25:06.390 --> 25:08.350]  Reverse osmosis and it's come a long way.
[25:08.350 --> 25:10.470]  So you can get an RO set up for the home.
[25:10.470 --> 25:12.950]  Make sure that you have a float
[25:12.990 --> 25:15.270]  so that you don't overflow your reservoir
[25:15.270 --> 25:18.230]  or just go ahead and get a big boy or a small boy.
[25:18.230 --> 25:20.390]  You turn on that water and it just runs all day.
[25:20.390 --> 25:22.790]  You fill up your reservoir, make sure you have a float
[25:22.790 --> 25:23.910]  so it turns off when it's full.
[25:23.910 --> 25:24.830]  You can learn how to do that.
[25:24.830 --> 25:27.150]  It's a whole nother step but do the research,
[25:27.150 --> 25:28.150]  find out what's in the water
[25:28.150 --> 25:29.590]  and then get the appropriate filter.
[25:29.590 --> 25:30.430]  I hope I helped you out.
[25:30.430 --> 25:31.510]  That was kind of a vague answer.
[25:31.510 --> 25:34.350]  I know big boy, small boy and RO,
[25:34.350 --> 25:36.590]  those are the three recommendations I would make.
[25:36.590 --> 25:37.870]  If you really wanna get critical,
[25:37.870 --> 25:39.030]  see what's in that water.
[25:39.030 --> 25:40.750]  Hey Thor, thank you for the great message.
[25:40.750 --> 25:41.990]  Thank you for all of the support, dude.
[25:42.030 --> 25:43.430]  I know you've been around for quite a while.
[25:43.430 --> 25:45.830]  It's good to see your name pop up in the email box.
[25:45.830 --> 25:48.710]  If you've got any more questions, please reach out to me.
[25:48.710 --> 25:53.470]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[25:53.470 --> 25:55.190]  All right, we do have another email in this episode.
[25:55.190 --> 25:57.150]  I'm just gonna keep running right through it.
[25:57.150 --> 25:57.990]  Mike has got the giggles.
[25:57.990 --> 25:59.550]  I'm at three.
[25:59.550 --> 26:00.390]  This is three, right?
[26:00.390 --> 26:02.430]  All right, email number three for this episode
[26:02.430 --> 26:05.070]  goes a lot like this and it actually says,
[26:05.070 --> 26:07.190]  feel free to shout out my name on Instagram.
[26:07.190 --> 26:08.550]  I am Dabby Hayes.
[26:08.550 --> 26:10.550]  So find our friend Dabby Hayes.
[26:10.590 --> 26:14.670]  No space, just Dabby with two Bs and Hayes, Dabby Hayes.
[26:14.670 --> 26:16.430]  The message says, hi Ross to Jeff.
[26:16.430 --> 26:18.270]  I really enjoy listening to your podcast
[26:18.270 --> 26:21.230]  and I felt I should contribute to the cause.
[26:21.230 --> 26:24.910]  So I signed up for the $4.20 a month, a plan.
[26:24.910 --> 26:26.390]  Geez, that was hard for my brain to read that.
[26:26.390 --> 26:29.910]  The 4.20 a month plan really made that slash, it got to me.
[26:29.910 --> 26:32.950]  Anyway, it says, I feel I get more than that value
[26:32.950 --> 26:36.270]  regarding Grow Tips and just the pure entertainment value.
[26:36.270 --> 26:37.470]  Thank you, that means a lot to me.
[26:37.470 --> 26:39.190]  I'm glad that you're getting your money's worth
[26:39.230 --> 26:41.510]  for the show and I understand that money is scarce,
[26:41.510 --> 26:42.870]  so I get it.
[26:42.870 --> 26:46.390]  Then it says, I live in a unfriendly prohibition state
[26:46.390 --> 26:48.190]  and I've been growing and smoking cannabis
[26:48.190 --> 26:50.190]  for almost 50 years.
[26:50.190 --> 26:53.230]  Your podcast, yeah, one of us due to big cannabis warrior,
[26:53.230 --> 26:55.950]  a long time warrior, longer than us, bro.
[26:55.950 --> 26:58.110]  It says your podcast and the Dude Grows show
[26:58.110 --> 27:01.310]  are my links to the outside legal cannabis community
[27:01.310 --> 27:03.030]  and I appreciate that.
[27:03.030 --> 27:05.230]  That's kind of cool to think that people are living
[27:05.230 --> 27:08.470]  vicariously through you and myself and the Dude Grows crew.
[27:08.510 --> 27:10.470]  Frightening and awesome all at the same time.
[27:10.470 --> 27:12.950]  Yeah, Colorado showing people how to do it.
[27:12.950 --> 27:14.430]  We get to smoke, we get to relax,
[27:14.430 --> 27:16.870]  we get to enjoy these beautiful concentrates.
[27:16.870 --> 27:18.550]  It's a good time, so I'm glad you are enjoying,
[27:18.550 --> 27:19.910]  I'm glad you're listening to my friends
[27:19.910 --> 27:20.790]  at the Dude Grows show.
[27:20.790 --> 27:24.110]  Also, big shout out to the Dude and Scotty and Guru
[27:24.110 --> 27:26.470]  and JR and Maestro and everybody else over there.
[27:26.470 --> 27:28.870]  I always forget somebody when I talk about them.
[27:29.990 --> 27:31.990]  I'm due for a visit to the bakery.
[27:31.990 --> 27:34.510]  I wanna take Mike up there also and go see my friends
[27:34.510 --> 27:35.790]  at the Dude Grows show.
[27:35.830 --> 27:38.510]  It goes on to say, I hope to make it to Denver next spring
[27:38.510 --> 27:40.350]  to attend the DGC cup.
[27:40.350 --> 27:44.310]  Well, it's gonna be summer or fall.
[27:44.310 --> 27:48.110]  Yeah, so I will be sure to say hi.
[27:48.110 --> 27:49.830]  Yeah, something's gonna happen.
[27:49.830 --> 27:52.630]  Stay tuned, the DGC cup will happen.
[27:52.630 --> 27:53.710]  We've got the venue booked.
[27:53.710 --> 27:55.670]  How many people can you get to Zoom meeting?
[27:55.670 --> 27:56.510]  Yeah, right?
[27:57.590 --> 27:58.910]  It's gonna happen, it will happen.
[27:58.910 --> 27:59.830]  It will be a thing.
[27:59.830 --> 28:01.430]  We just have to be patient.
[28:01.430 --> 28:04.230]  And who wants to be smoking with everybody right now anyway?
[28:04.230 --> 28:05.230]  We need to be responsible.
[28:05.230 --> 28:06.710]  So that will happen, it's coming up.
[28:06.710 --> 28:08.870]  And it says, I almost forgot to mention,
[28:08.870 --> 28:11.390]  I just bought a pack of Orange Gasm from Seeds here now.
[28:11.390 --> 28:13.990]  And I look forward to popping these beans.
[28:13.990 --> 28:15.510]  Man, I cannot wait.
[28:15.510 --> 28:16.910]  Now this means that you have got time
[28:16.910 --> 28:19.190]  to grow some Orange Gasm and bring it to us
[28:19.190 --> 28:21.750]  when we hang out at the Dude Grows cup.
[28:21.750 --> 28:22.910]  That's what that means.
[28:22.910 --> 28:25.830]  Also, pictures or it didn't happen.
[28:25.830 --> 28:28.110]  I wanna see that Orange Gasm.
[28:28.110 --> 28:29.790]  Dude, Dabby Hayes, thank you for the great message.
[28:29.790 --> 28:31.030]  I look forward to shaking your hand.
[28:31.030 --> 28:33.310]  I look forward to taking a fat dab with you
[28:33.310 --> 28:35.230]  whenever all this COVID stuff is over.
[28:35.230 --> 28:37.310]  We're gonna meet up at the Dude Grows show
[28:37.310 --> 28:39.150]  up there in Denver, Colorado.
[28:39.150 --> 28:40.350]  White Mike will be there.
[28:40.350 --> 28:41.510]  I'll be there.
[28:41.510 --> 28:43.110]  Mike's nodding his head like I will.
[28:43.110 --> 28:44.830]  Yeah, bro, you'll be there.
[28:44.830 --> 28:46.950]  And our buddy Dabby Hayes will be there
[28:46.950 --> 28:49.270]  and we're gonna dab the fuck down.
[28:49.270 --> 28:50.110]  I cannot wait.
[28:50.110 --> 28:51.670]  Dude, thank you for the great message.
[28:51.670 --> 28:53.110]  Hey Mike, we're on a roll.
[28:53.110 --> 28:54.870]  I'm gonna read one more email.
[28:54.870 --> 28:56.550]  Let's just dive right into it.
[28:56.550 --> 28:58.310]  He's going for four people.
[28:58.310 --> 28:59.230]  Let's just jump right in.
[28:59.230 --> 29:02.390]  It says, hello, you can call me Tonto as my friends do
[29:02.390 --> 29:03.830]  if you use this email.
[29:03.830 --> 29:05.110]  What's up, bro?
[29:05.110 --> 29:07.910]  It says, my name is blank from Alberta, Canada.
[29:07.910 --> 29:09.150]  He put his real name in there also.
[29:09.150 --> 29:09.990]  So we're just gonna call him.
[29:09.990 --> 29:12.470]  My name is Tonto from Alberta, Canada.
[29:12.470 --> 29:15.470]  Thanks to all of the hard work and audio material
[29:15.470 --> 29:17.590]  you have put out at zero cost to everyone,
[29:17.590 --> 29:20.070]  which has given me the confidence and knowledge
[29:20.070 --> 29:22.470]  to switch from legal productions
[29:22.470 --> 29:25.310]  to at-home medical cultivation.
[29:25.310 --> 29:27.670]  That is a great opening line.
[29:27.670 --> 29:30.470]  All of the hard work and audio material
[29:30.470 --> 29:34.110]  and video material at this point at zero cost to everybody.
[29:34.110 --> 29:35.790]  That's right, it does not require any payment.
[29:35.790 --> 29:37.190]  This is free, free, free.
[29:37.190 --> 29:39.390]  Like Ben Harper said, free freedom.
[29:39.390 --> 29:40.230]  I'm glad you noticed.
[29:40.230 --> 29:41.150]  I'm glad you appreciate it.
[29:41.150 --> 29:42.470]  And you're very welcome.
[29:42.470 --> 29:45.470]  And I'm honored that I gave you knowledge and courage
[29:45.470 --> 29:47.830]  to switch from working with a legal company
[29:47.830 --> 29:51.070]  to your own home medical cultivation.
[29:51.070 --> 29:53.870]  It goes on to say, I recently received my license
[29:53.870 --> 29:56.910]  from Health Canada to legally grow 25 plants.
[29:56.910 --> 29:58.350]  Congratulations, bro.
[29:58.390 --> 30:01.590]  He says, no words or amount of money can show my gratitude
[30:01.590 --> 30:03.830]  for sharing so much knowledge with the community.
[30:03.830 --> 30:06.110]  Your podcast is my number one way
[30:06.110 --> 30:08.750]  to consume and absorb information.
[30:08.750 --> 30:10.950]  That is fucking awesome, thank you.
[30:10.950 --> 30:12.790]  When I close my eyes, I imagine
[30:12.790 --> 30:15.070]  that I can see my grow in Canada
[30:15.070 --> 30:16.870]  because this person has listened to so much.
[30:16.870 --> 30:18.110]  He's got a trellis out.
[30:18.110 --> 30:20.590]  He's got three gallon pots and a thousand watt lights.
[30:20.590 --> 30:22.270]  He's just doing my shit probably.
[30:22.270 --> 30:24.070]  And that's beautiful to think about.
[30:24.070 --> 30:25.150]  So from the bottom of my heart,
[30:25.150 --> 30:28.190]  thank you for providing a fantastic foundation
[30:29.030 --> 30:30.270]  of knowledge for me to build on.
[30:30.270 --> 30:31.870]  Dude, that is awesome, thank you.
[30:31.870 --> 30:34.510]  I love knowing that people are having success
[30:34.510 --> 30:35.510]  with the podcast.
[30:35.510 --> 30:37.670]  I love knowing they're having success with my advice,
[30:37.670 --> 30:38.510]  with my knowledge.
[30:38.510 --> 30:40.030]  That's why the show exists.
[30:40.030 --> 30:40.870]  Yeah.
[30:40.870 --> 30:42.550]  It's so rewarding to hear that.
[30:42.550 --> 30:44.470]  Yeah, and then you see them grow the seeds I breed
[30:44.470 --> 30:46.150]  and listen to the show and then they smoke it
[30:46.150 --> 30:46.990]  and they feel better.
[30:46.990 --> 30:48.190]  It's an amazing feeling.
[30:48.190 --> 30:49.150]  So thank you, bro.
[30:49.150 --> 30:50.830]  I return that feeling.
[30:50.830 --> 30:52.230]  I express that gratitude as well
[30:52.230 --> 30:53.390]  because without the listeners
[30:53.390 --> 30:54.590]  and without these types of emails,
[30:54.590 --> 30:56.190]  I wouldn't know I'm doing a good job.
[30:56.190 --> 30:57.030]  So thank you.
[30:57.030 --> 30:58.350]  High five, fist bump.
[30:58.350 --> 31:00.110]  I respect that and appreciate you.
[31:00.110 --> 31:01.630]  It also goes on to say,
[31:01.630 --> 31:04.470]  I hope that you and yours are doing well and safe here
[31:04.470 --> 31:06.990]  in this time of uncertainty in our world.
[31:06.990 --> 31:08.390]  I know a lot of people have been
[31:08.390 --> 31:11.750]  and will continue to be hit very hard by COVID-19.
[31:11.750 --> 31:14.270]  I am very fortunate to be in my current situation
[31:14.270 --> 31:16.550]  which has left me better off than most.
[31:16.550 --> 31:18.510]  Big respect to that, bro.
[31:18.510 --> 31:19.990]  But to show my thanks and support,
[31:19.990 --> 31:22.430]  I have increased my Patreon subscription.
[31:22.430 --> 31:24.830]  Although small, it still helps, I am sure.
[31:24.830 --> 31:26.550]  If anything helps right now,
[31:27.070 --> 31:29.030]  especially like you said, in this time of COVID,
[31:29.030 --> 31:30.590]  it's very generous of anybody
[31:30.590 --> 31:31.990]  to help anybody else out right now.
[31:31.990 --> 31:33.750]  Things are tight, so thank you.
[31:33.750 --> 31:35.510]  Yeah, we do appreciate that.
[31:35.510 --> 31:37.910]  Also, I'm gonna shamelessly pitch Mike's Patreon,
[31:37.910 --> 31:40.430]  patreon.com forward slash white Mike.
[31:40.430 --> 31:43.110]  He's got a new Patreon, so check him out.
[31:43.110 --> 31:44.110]  It goes on though.
[31:44.110 --> 31:47.710]  It says, there we are.
[31:47.710 --> 31:48.950]  I did have a couple of questions
[31:48.950 --> 31:50.430]  I was hoping you could answer for me.
[31:50.430 --> 31:52.430]  Am I covering my face from the camera when I do this part?
[31:52.430 --> 31:53.470]  I'm trying to be camera conscious.
[31:53.470 --> 31:54.510]  A little bit.
[31:54.510 --> 31:56.510]  Yeah, I'm gonna get a lapel mic and do this differently
[31:56.510 --> 31:57.670]  so the mic's not right here.
[31:57.670 --> 32:00.310]  Then it says, I've searched the internet for answers already
[32:00.310 --> 32:02.150]  but the information wasn't available.
[32:02.150 --> 32:05.430]  I didn't trust or there was no source for the information.
[32:05.430 --> 32:08.270]  Man, you are very smart for not trusting some information
[32:08.270 --> 32:09.390]  that you read on the internet
[32:09.390 --> 32:11.790]  because people can type whatever they want.
[32:11.790 --> 32:12.630]  If I just went and typed,
[32:12.630 --> 32:15.830]  hey, it would be good for you to send Ross to Jeff $4
[32:15.830 --> 32:18.150]  every single day and that's good karma.
[32:18.150 --> 32:19.950]  I can just type that on the internet, people will believe it.
[32:19.950 --> 32:22.910]  So you gotta be careful because people could type anything.
[32:22.910 --> 32:25.350]  Then you say, you mentioned it in one of your episodes
[32:25.350 --> 32:27.630]  that you would remove any large fan leaves
[32:27.630 --> 32:28.790]  with the purple stem.
[32:28.790 --> 32:31.590]  I'm curious as to why, since I first heard it.
[32:31.590 --> 32:34.550]  I've been doing a bit more defoliation every grow
[32:34.550 --> 32:36.030]  as I get more confident.
[32:36.030 --> 32:37.230]  Could you explain to me?
[32:38.150 --> 32:40.750]  Okay, then that's when they ask another question.
[32:40.750 --> 32:44.790]  The first question here is why do we remove the leaves
[32:44.790 --> 32:46.110]  with purple petioles?
[32:46.110 --> 32:48.150]  Because I've talked about when you're defoliating
[32:48.150 --> 32:50.750]  any leaf with a purple petiole is a perfect candidate
[32:50.750 --> 32:52.670]  to remove from the garden.
[32:52.670 --> 32:55.550]  That's what I train the guys and gals
[32:55.550 --> 32:58.390]  in commercial cultivation environments
[32:58.390 --> 33:01.430]  because it is a very easy identifier of what goes.
[33:01.430 --> 33:02.690]  If it's purple, it can go.
[33:02.690 --> 33:04.150]  Guys and girls can see purple.
[33:04.150 --> 33:06.430]  24 year old stoners can see purple.
[33:06.430 --> 33:07.630]  It's really identifiable.
[33:07.630 --> 33:10.510]  It's really easy to compare it to a nice bright green petiole
[33:10.510 --> 33:12.070]  or green leaf.
[33:12.070 --> 33:15.190]  If it's purple, that means it's probably big enough
[33:15.190 --> 33:16.010]  to be taken off.
[33:16.010 --> 33:18.190]  Generally, the purple leaves are the bigger leaves,
[33:18.190 --> 33:20.550]  the big fan leaves, those petioles are sticking off.
[33:20.550 --> 33:22.070]  And if you can see that it's purple,
[33:22.070 --> 33:24.430]  it's probably long enough for your eye to visually notice.
[33:24.430 --> 33:26.350]  And that tells me you can take it out of the garden.
[33:26.350 --> 33:28.910]  So the purple petiole leaves are the first ones to go.
[33:28.910 --> 33:30.430]  They're also the older leaves.
[33:30.430 --> 33:31.710]  So they're probably bigger.
[33:31.710 --> 33:33.910]  They're also the ones that are going to be nutrient deficient
[33:33.910 --> 33:36.030]  first, those bigger leaves are where the bugs
[33:36.030 --> 33:36.930]  are gonna hide first.
[33:36.930 --> 33:38.350]  They're blocking the shadows below.
[33:38.350 --> 33:40.350]  So the light can't get down or they're blocking the light.
[33:40.350 --> 33:42.350]  So you got shadows down below.
[33:42.350 --> 33:44.230]  It's basically, they're the biggest leaves.
[33:44.230 --> 33:45.770]  They're also running out of nutrients
[33:45.770 --> 33:46.950]  is why they're changing color.
[33:46.950 --> 33:48.430]  So I take those out of there.
[33:48.430 --> 33:50.950]  And it's just a real easy indicator to teach the guys
[33:50.950 --> 33:53.150]  and gals in the grow, go get all the purple petioles
[33:53.150 --> 33:54.110]  and clean them out.
[33:54.110 --> 33:55.310]  And then they get real good at it.
[33:55.310 --> 33:56.590]  And then they can just, you tell them now,
[33:56.590 --> 33:58.270]  take a little bit more after that,
[33:58.270 --> 34:00.510]  or take just another layer after that.
[34:00.510 --> 34:01.430]  And then you just get them trained
[34:01.430 --> 34:02.810]  and they can do it visually after a while.
[34:02.810 --> 34:05.130]  They start understanding what needs to go.
[34:05.130 --> 34:06.830]  You're saying that you're becoming more comfortable
[34:06.830 --> 34:08.910]  with defoliation, keep doing it.
[34:08.910 --> 34:11.110]  And you will see overdo it on one plant,
[34:11.110 --> 34:13.830]  purposefully overdo it, see what the limit is,
[34:13.830 --> 34:14.830]  because you'll be surprised.
[34:14.830 --> 34:16.470]  Some plants respond very well.
[34:16.470 --> 34:18.390]  Some plants, they get kind of pissy with you
[34:18.390 --> 34:19.510]  if you defoliate too hard.
[34:19.510 --> 34:21.750]  So experiment with that and dial it in.
[34:21.750 --> 34:23.790]  But that is why I say take the purples
[34:23.790 --> 34:25.830]  because those are the bigger, older leaves
[34:25.830 --> 34:29.750]  and they're beginning to become nutrient deficient.
[34:30.910 --> 34:33.350]  There is a second part, maybe a third part coming up too.
[34:33.350 --> 34:35.950]  It says, could you explain or point me to the podcast
[34:35.950 --> 34:37.190]  about reusing soil?
[34:37.190 --> 34:39.670]  I wanna be more eco-friendly and save a bit.
[34:39.670 --> 34:41.030]  I would like to reuse my soil
[34:41.030 --> 34:44.070]  if there are not too many cons in doing so.
[34:44.070 --> 34:47.110]  I am not the expert in soil recycling.
[34:47.110 --> 34:49.410]  I do it in a very archaic manner.
[34:49.410 --> 34:52.290]  I don't think I do it in a very,
[34:52.290 --> 34:54.970]  it's just, there's no fanciness to what I'm doing.
[34:54.970 --> 34:57.570]  I am using, we have to identify the fact
[34:57.570 --> 34:59.850]  that there is soil and soilless mix.
[34:59.850 --> 35:03.010]  Soil is alive, soil's got microbes in it.
[35:03.010 --> 35:05.530]  It's probably got some worms and shit going on in there.
[35:05.530 --> 35:06.930]  I am using a soilless mix.
[35:06.930 --> 35:10.490]  I'm not sure which you're using, but there is a difference.
[35:10.490 --> 35:12.490]  The soil is alive.
[35:12.490 --> 35:14.570]  Living soil will eat all of the stuff.
[35:14.570 --> 35:17.330]  If you take a plant out and leave that soil there,
[35:17.330 --> 35:20.450]  the root ball in there and all of the microbes and enzymes
[35:20.450 --> 35:23.010]  and things happening in that soil will decompose
[35:23.010 --> 35:25.210]  and eat that root ball and turn that into fuel
[35:25.210 --> 35:26.050]  for the next plant.
[35:26.050 --> 35:27.570]  So if you're doing it that way,
[35:27.570 --> 35:29.090]  that's kind of a no-till environment.
[35:29.090 --> 35:31.370]  You could cut out the main plant,
[35:31.370 --> 35:33.730]  cut out the main stock, put a new plant in there
[35:33.730 --> 35:37.610]  and backfill it with compost or fresh soil cut with compost
[35:37.610 --> 35:38.450]  right on top of there.
[35:38.450 --> 35:40.410]  Again, I'm not a no-till guy.
[35:40.410 --> 35:41.850]  Some details will be off here,
[35:41.850 --> 35:44.370]  but you can basically pull out the root ball,
[35:44.370 --> 35:45.610]  put a new plant in there,
[35:45.610 --> 35:48.370]  backfill with some compost or some cut compost,
[35:48.370 --> 35:50.450]  fill that in, put a new cover crop over it
[35:50.450 --> 35:52.090]  and continue to grow with that.
[35:52.090 --> 35:53.610]  The cover crop will fall in,
[35:53.610 --> 35:56.490]  provide nutrients to that soil base.
[35:56.490 --> 35:57.570]  You can put some worms in there
[35:57.570 --> 35:58.890]  and keep all that shit alive.
[35:58.890 --> 36:01.650]  That's a living soil, no-till environment.
[36:01.650 --> 36:03.210]  It is much easier to recycle that.
[36:03.210 --> 36:04.250]  You don't even take it out.
[36:04.250 --> 36:06.210]  You pull a plant out, you put a plant in.
[36:06.210 --> 36:07.130]  You don't have to flush it
[36:07.130 --> 36:09.050]  because you're always adding organic amendments
[36:09.050 --> 36:10.690]  or organic nutrients.
[36:10.690 --> 36:12.490]  There's no chelated or buffered products
[36:12.490 --> 36:13.730]  being force-fed to the plants.
[36:13.730 --> 36:15.610]  You don't have to worry about flushing.
[36:15.610 --> 36:17.050]  It's a totally different environment.
[36:17.050 --> 36:18.610]  That is a living soil.
[36:18.610 --> 36:19.810]  You'll know if you've got that.
[36:19.810 --> 36:21.050]  You've been feeding it microbes,
[36:21.050 --> 36:22.090]  you've been giving it worms,
[36:22.090 --> 36:23.770]  you've been feeding it cover crop.
[36:23.770 --> 36:24.650]  If you went to the store
[36:24.650 --> 36:26.730]  and you got some shit mixed with perlite
[36:26.730 --> 36:30.210]  and it's mostly peat and you got like other microbes
[36:30.210 --> 36:32.050]  and just shit like that and it was on the shelf,
[36:32.050 --> 36:33.890]  that is probably soilless mix.
[36:33.890 --> 36:36.170]  That's a much different beast.
[36:36.170 --> 36:38.170]  It's not alive, so you've got to flush it.
[36:38.170 --> 36:40.330]  You've got to clean it out if you're gonna reuse it.
[36:40.330 --> 36:41.170]  You've been feeding it,
[36:41.170 --> 36:43.010]  probably been feeding it for nine weeks.
[36:43.010 --> 36:44.530]  You've been giving it nutrients.
[36:44.530 --> 36:45.650]  Probably longer than that.
[36:45.650 --> 36:47.690]  It was in bed, he flowered for nine weeks,
[36:47.690 --> 36:49.250]  then hopefully flushed for two.
[36:49.250 --> 36:51.770]  We didn't remove all of the nutrients at that point
[36:51.770 --> 36:52.610]  when we flushed.
[36:52.610 --> 36:54.290]  So you need to make sure
[36:54.290 --> 36:56.050]  that you get all the nutrients out of there.
[36:56.050 --> 36:58.930]  Also, if you had any bugs or any problems,
[36:58.930 --> 37:02.570]  I would not recommend recycling that soil in any way.
[37:02.570 --> 37:04.810]  Get rid of that dirt because you don't wanna bring
[37:04.810 --> 37:08.050]  those bugs, those pests, those issues back into the grow.
[37:08.050 --> 37:10.570]  So if you're going to recycle the soil,
[37:10.570 --> 37:12.610]  like my email keeps opening on my computer on its own.
[37:13.170 --> 37:14.010]  There we go.
[37:14.010 --> 37:16.370]  If you're going to recycle the soil,
[37:16.370 --> 37:17.890]  I would put it into,
[37:17.890 --> 37:19.130]  first of all, I would try to remove
[37:19.130 --> 37:21.690]  as much of the organic matter from the soil as possible.
[37:21.690 --> 37:23.730]  Get all the root balls, get all the roots out of there
[37:23.730 --> 37:26.330]  because we don't have much to clean that out.
[37:26.330 --> 37:27.890]  I'd put it into a container.
[37:27.890 --> 37:30.850]  Then I would probably add more soil to it.
[37:30.850 --> 37:32.450]  I would dilute it with some fresh soil,
[37:32.450 --> 37:33.850]  get some fresh soil charge in there,
[37:33.850 --> 37:36.250]  maybe like a third to half fresh soil.
[37:36.250 --> 37:38.770]  Mix that up, then I would add some microbes to it.
[37:38.770 --> 37:40.930]  Then I would water in some enzymes.
[37:40.930 --> 37:42.490]  Those enzymes will help break down
[37:42.490 --> 37:44.010]  all of the old dead shit.
[37:44.010 --> 37:45.450]  If there's anything you don't want in there,
[37:45.450 --> 37:47.530]  that enzyme will also help clean up the soil.
[37:47.530 --> 37:49.930]  If there's just a small pathogen or something like that,
[37:49.930 --> 37:52.250]  let's get enough microbes and enzymes in there
[37:52.250 --> 37:54.330]  to overrun all of that shit.
[37:54.330 --> 37:55.410]  Give it a little bit of time,
[37:55.410 --> 37:58.010]  maybe a day or three for that shit to kind of get active,
[37:58.010 --> 38:00.410]  the microbes, the enzymes to move around,
[38:00.410 --> 38:01.490]  stir it all up.
[38:01.490 --> 38:03.330]  Then, in my opinion, at that point,
[38:03.330 --> 38:05.690]  it is ready to mix with perlite or persolite
[38:05.690 --> 38:06.970]  and go right back into action.
[38:06.970 --> 38:09.250]  As long as you flushed it, as long as you cleaned it out,
[38:09.250 --> 38:10.810]  as long as you put some microbes
[38:10.810 --> 38:12.130]  and some enzymes in there,
[38:12.130 --> 38:14.850]  I think you can recycle it if you did not have a problem.
[38:14.850 --> 38:16.810]  If you had a problem, throw it away.
[38:16.810 --> 38:20.570]  Now, I am not an expert at recycling in living soil
[38:20.570 --> 38:24.610]  or organic soilless mixes, so I don't do that very much.
[38:24.610 --> 38:25.890]  I prefer not to do that.
[38:25.890 --> 38:27.570]  I prefer to buy fresh soil.
[38:27.570 --> 38:29.570]  Most of my soil that comes from the grow
[38:29.570 --> 38:31.650]  will end up in the garden outside
[38:31.650 --> 38:34.370]  or we fill some of Mike's fucking until land
[38:34.370 --> 38:35.570]  because he's got a new yard.
[38:35.570 --> 38:37.010]  It goes for things like that.
[38:37.010 --> 38:38.530]  I've got a friend across town.
[38:38.570 --> 38:39.490]  I would chime in with that.
[38:39.490 --> 38:41.650]  If you don't want to reuse it in the garden,
[38:41.650 --> 38:44.690]  there's a bunch of other places you can reuse it.
[38:45.730 --> 38:49.050]  Some of the best vegetable gardens I've ever had
[38:49.050 --> 38:54.010]  were terrible clay, nasty, sandy dirt
[38:54.010 --> 38:59.010]  in a bad backyard mixed 50-50 with old soilless mix
[39:00.650 --> 39:02.010]  and root ball compost.
[39:02.970 --> 39:06.410]  A lot of mine goes to a house just a few blocks that way
[39:06.410 --> 39:08.130]  and he's got a summer garden every year.
[39:08.730 --> 39:09.570]  He grows vegetables.
[39:09.570 --> 39:11.090]  He's got tomatoes and onions and peppers
[39:11.090 --> 39:12.250]  and all the stuff you could imagine
[39:12.250 --> 39:13.650]  that we grow around here.
[39:13.650 --> 39:15.970]  And he comes and gets my old soil and takes it
[39:15.970 --> 39:17.850]  and then brings me back vegetables.
[39:17.850 --> 39:19.490]  Like you cannot complain about that.
[39:19.490 --> 39:21.650]  So some of it I do recycle,
[39:21.650 --> 39:24.530]  but some of it once it gets old, I choose not to.
[39:24.530 --> 39:26.210]  I just, I know it's not eco-friendly,
[39:26.210 --> 39:28.690]  but as long as it ends up back in a garden outside some more,
[39:28.690 --> 39:30.130]  I think it's okay.
[39:30.130 --> 39:31.890]  But if you're gonna do no-till stuff,
[39:31.890 --> 39:34.170]  you could just pull it out, put it right back in.
[39:34.170 --> 39:36.370]  Again, if you got bugs or anything, don't do it.
[39:36.370 --> 39:38.090]  If you had powdery mildew, if you had thrips,
[39:38.850 --> 39:39.770]  if you had mites, I don't recommend it
[39:39.770 --> 39:41.730]  because you're just gonna bring those right back in.
[39:41.730 --> 39:43.410]  They're gonna love to live in that dirt.
[39:43.410 --> 39:45.050]  All right, I've been rambling on about that.
[39:45.050 --> 39:46.890]  I'm not an expert at recycling soil.
[39:46.890 --> 39:48.410]  That is not my area of expertise.
[39:48.410 --> 39:50.090]  That is my basic guidance.
[39:50.090 --> 39:51.450]  There's a lot more to this message.
[39:51.450 --> 39:53.210]  I wanna make sure to get through all of it.
[39:53.210 --> 39:56.010]  It says, during COVID-19, my access to RO water
[39:56.010 --> 39:58.530]  from the store could be restricted.
[39:58.530 --> 40:01.170]  If the situation arise that I couldn't get RO,
[40:01.170 --> 40:05.250]  would the calcium buildup do any harm in a veg tent
[40:05.290 --> 40:08.850]  or would it just build white powder on everything?
[40:08.850 --> 40:10.490]  So I'm assuming you've watered
[40:10.490 --> 40:11.970]  and let it dry a couple of times
[40:11.970 --> 40:13.650]  and you see that little white ring
[40:13.650 --> 40:15.210]  around the bottom of your pots.
[40:16.650 --> 40:18.290]  It depends on how much calcium is in there.
[40:18.290 --> 40:21.050]  Like we talked about in the previous email,
[40:21.050 --> 40:25.170]  do a water test, check the PEMs, check the EC and the PPH.
[40:25.170 --> 40:26.850]  The plants want a little bit of calcium
[40:26.850 --> 40:28.690]  but not ridiculous amounts.
[40:28.690 --> 40:31.970]  So you may potentially, if you've got a lot of hard water,
[40:31.970 --> 40:34.570]  you could potentially OD the plants on calcium.
[40:34.890 --> 40:36.690]  You may wanna consider getting a big boy
[40:36.690 --> 40:39.290]  or a small boy filter, but check the water,
[40:39.290 --> 40:40.130]  see what's in there.
[40:40.130 --> 40:41.250]  You may be paranoid.
[40:41.250 --> 40:43.170]  It may not be anything to worry about.
[40:43.170 --> 40:44.890]  Again, do that water test.
[40:44.890 --> 40:48.490]  But the calcium buildup doing any harm,
[40:48.490 --> 40:50.570]  if you're seeing it, it may be a bit much,
[40:50.570 --> 40:52.730]  but I don't know how long you've been using
[40:52.730 --> 40:53.890]  whatever water you're using.
[40:53.890 --> 40:55.290]  So I don't know how long it's been building up there.
[40:55.290 --> 40:57.130]  Around the edge of the sink and shit,
[40:57.130 --> 40:58.010]  you're gonna see buildup.
[40:58.010 --> 40:59.090]  So don't get too paranoid on that.
[40:59.090 --> 41:00.690]  But if you're seeing it in your pots,
[41:00.690 --> 41:02.050]  it may be something to think about.
[41:02.050 --> 41:03.090]  All right, there is more.
[41:03.090 --> 41:05.090]  It says, I don't know if you've answered this,
[41:05.090 --> 41:07.330]  but I remember hearing in one of the episodes
[41:07.330 --> 41:09.970]  not to mix liquid add-ons with organics.
[41:09.970 --> 41:11.730]  I'm currently using Gaia Greens,
[41:11.730 --> 41:14.570]  all-purpose, 4-4-4 dry amendments.
[41:14.570 --> 41:18.130]  Would I be able to use liquid karma without doing any harm?
[41:18.130 --> 41:21.490]  Are there even any cons to mixing the two?
[41:21.490 --> 41:26.490]  So I've said not to use liquid with organics.
[41:27.090 --> 41:28.850]  What I think I was talking about is sometimes
[41:28.850 --> 41:32.330]  if you have got an all organic environment,
[41:32.330 --> 41:34.890]  many of the bottled nutrients are buffered and chelated.
[41:34.890 --> 41:37.210]  They may have higher, low pHs.
[41:37.210 --> 41:40.490]  Some of the things in those bottles may destroy
[41:40.490 --> 41:42.450]  or disrupt your organic environment.
[41:42.450 --> 41:44.370]  Like, I don't know what could be in there.
[41:44.370 --> 41:45.210]  I don't even wanna guess,
[41:45.210 --> 41:47.650]  but just imagine how non-organic things
[41:47.650 --> 41:49.290]  destroy organic things.
[41:49.290 --> 41:50.530]  It'll just wipe it right out.
[41:50.530 --> 41:53.250]  So you've gotta be careful when mixing products like that.
[41:53.250 --> 41:56.250]  You can absolutely mix liquids and powders.
[41:56.250 --> 41:58.490]  I put dry Vegebloom base nudes.
[41:58.490 --> 42:01.010]  I put dry Vegebloom Shine into a reservoir
[42:01.010 --> 42:03.010]  and then I add liquid new millennium nutrients
[42:03.010 --> 42:04.530]  to that all day long.
[42:04.530 --> 42:07.770]  So you can add the liquids and the dry fertilizers.
[42:07.770 --> 42:09.970]  It's the organic and non-organic stuff
[42:09.970 --> 42:12.890]  that's gonna cause you possible problems.
[42:12.890 --> 42:15.010]  This person said they're using Gaia Greens
[42:15.010 --> 42:17.170]  and they wanna add liquid karma.
[42:17.170 --> 42:18.650]  Liquid karma will work well
[42:18.650 --> 42:21.210]  with almost any nutrient regimen.
[42:21.210 --> 42:22.370]  I think it is great.
[42:22.370 --> 42:23.330]  It's got kelp in there.
[42:23.330 --> 42:24.410]  It's going to add microbes.
[42:24.410 --> 42:25.330]  It's gonna add density.
[42:25.330 --> 42:27.050]  It's gonna add flavor and aroma.
[42:27.050 --> 42:29.210]  I think liquid karma would be great.
[42:29.210 --> 42:31.410]  It's going to increase your PPMs,
[42:31.410 --> 42:32.410]  but here's what to think about.
[42:32.410 --> 42:33.330]  It's not nitrogen.
[42:33.330 --> 42:34.250]  It's not phosphorous.
[42:34.250 --> 42:35.170]  It's not potassium.
[42:35.170 --> 42:37.290]  It's not things that are going to burn the plant.
[42:37.290 --> 42:38.290]  So don't worry about it.
[42:38.290 --> 42:40.450]  Go ahead and add the liquid karma.
[42:40.450 --> 42:42.250]  I think it's a great product.
[42:42.250 --> 42:44.170]  They go on to list a lot of details of their grow,
[42:44.170 --> 42:45.330]  which we don't need to get into
[42:45.330 --> 42:46.850]  because I think I understand
[42:46.850 --> 42:48.370]  how to answer the question without that.
[42:48.370 --> 42:50.650]  Yes, use the liquid karma.
[42:50.650 --> 42:51.770]  When I'm looking about your grow,
[42:51.770 --> 42:53.850]  sounds like it's doing great.
[42:53.850 --> 42:56.770]  Yeah, everything sounds like it's even added perlite,
[42:56.770 --> 42:57.730]  just like I said before.
[42:57.730 --> 42:58.970]  So I think we're doing good.
[42:59.730 --> 43:00.570]  I wanna read the last part.
[43:00.570 --> 43:01.730]  It says, lastly, I'm very excited to tell you
[43:01.730 --> 43:04.090]  that I have ordered some of your genetics.
[43:04.090 --> 43:05.930]  I picked up Orangegasm, Lemon Jeffrey,
[43:05.930 --> 43:07.450]  and Strawberry Starburst.
[43:07.450 --> 43:09.050]  That is a beautiful mix.
[43:09.050 --> 43:11.290]  You got oranges, lemons, and strawberries.
[43:11.290 --> 43:13.130]  Yeah, it's gonna be a really nice grow.
[43:13.130 --> 43:15.130]  I will start posting pics mostly,
[43:15.130 --> 43:17.250]  most likely around the fall.
[43:17.250 --> 43:18.370]  Is it almost time for fall?
[43:18.370 --> 43:19.250]  When did you send this?
[43:19.250 --> 43:20.250]  Nope, we gotta wait.
[43:21.130 --> 43:21.970]  I had to check the date.
[43:21.970 --> 43:23.970]  And if it came from last year, it'd be fall time.
[43:23.970 --> 43:25.570]  I heard you last night on Instagram.
[43:25.570 --> 43:27.130]  Oh, I know this person.
[43:27.130 --> 43:30.890]  Instagram Live saying, no one ever follows through.
[43:30.890 --> 43:31.730]  Well, I will.
[43:31.730 --> 43:32.570]  Oh, because I made the joke
[43:32.570 --> 43:34.050]  that everybody says they're gonna take pictures
[43:34.050 --> 43:35.490]  and nobody on Instagram sends me the pics.
[43:35.490 --> 43:39.770]  They say they're gonna send, but I hope you do, my friend.
[43:39.770 --> 43:41.810]  Then it says, where are we?
[43:41.810 --> 43:43.130]  They won't be the best, but I will.
[43:43.130 --> 43:44.170]  Bro, I look forward to your pictures.
[43:44.170 --> 43:45.770]  If there are quality photos,
[43:45.770 --> 43:47.450]  I'll be happy to send me pics of my kids.
[43:47.450 --> 43:48.330]  I wanna see them.
[43:48.330 --> 43:49.450]  I do have intentions of starting
[43:49.450 --> 43:51.490]  my first breeding project sometime next year.
[43:51.490 --> 43:53.370]  So once again, from the bottom of my heart,
[43:53.370 --> 43:55.410]  thank you for all that you do for this community
[43:55.410 --> 43:58.370]  and arming us new growers with the knowledge.
[43:58.370 --> 43:59.850]  Bro, you are very welcome.
[43:59.850 --> 44:01.490]  I look forward to seeing your breeding project.
[44:01.490 --> 44:03.130]  I wanna know what you create,
[44:03.130 --> 44:04.930]  what comes out of your palate, what do you do,
[44:04.930 --> 44:06.010]  what's on your mind?
[44:06.010 --> 44:07.330]  Very interested.
[44:07.330 --> 44:09.450]  Then it says, if you're ever up in Canada,
[44:09.450 --> 44:10.930]  please let me know.
[44:10.930 --> 44:13.210]  Mike, it sounds like we got somewhere to go hang out now.
[44:13.210 --> 44:15.730]  Then they signed it from your new friend, Tonto.
[44:15.730 --> 44:17.250]  Hey, Tonto, thank you for the great message.
[44:17.250 --> 44:18.210]  I do appreciate that.
[44:18.210 --> 44:20.090]  I hope I answered all of your questions.
[44:20.090 --> 44:22.250]  There were a lot of great things going on in there.
[44:22.250 --> 44:24.690]  I wanna make sure that I've got the same message.
[44:24.730 --> 44:25.570]  Yeah, there we go.
[44:25.570 --> 44:27.930]  A lot of great things going on in there.
[44:27.930 --> 44:28.970]  Man, let me know how it goes.
[44:28.970 --> 44:31.250]  Let me know if you have any more questions,
[44:31.250 --> 44:32.330]  how else I can help you out.
[44:32.330 --> 44:33.690]  Let me know how the breeding project goes.
[44:33.690 --> 44:38.130]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[44:38.130 --> 44:40.650]  Mike, I think that was four emails you wanna call that one.
[44:40.650 --> 44:41.970]  You did four, yo.
[44:41.970 --> 44:44.010]  All right, I think that sounds like we've done enough
[44:44.010 --> 44:44.850]  for the show.
[44:44.850 --> 44:45.690]  We should probably stop.
[44:45.690 --> 44:46.890]  We should probably stop.
[44:46.890 --> 44:48.210]  Save some for the rest.
[44:48.210 --> 44:49.090]  Are we still recording?
[44:49.090 --> 44:51.050]  I don't even know that Zoom is still recording.
[44:51.050 --> 44:52.010]  I hope it is.
[44:52.010 --> 44:52.850]  Oh, it is.
[44:52.850 --> 44:53.690]  Okay, for a minute there,
[44:53.690 --> 44:54.770]  Zoom went kind of weird on me.
[44:54.770 --> 44:55.610]  All right.
[44:55.610 --> 44:56.730]  Sorry to get paranoid on you guys.
[44:56.730 --> 44:59.210]  I may not even cut that part out of the show.
[44:59.210 --> 45:00.290]  We're still recording.
[45:00.290 --> 45:01.570]  It's going pretty well.
[45:01.570 --> 45:03.330]  Yeah, we haven't had any major glitches yet.
[45:03.330 --> 45:06.610]  So I'm just gonna shut up about that and keep talking.
[45:06.610 --> 45:08.530]  Right, just let the dice keep rolling.
[45:08.530 --> 45:09.890]  Yeah, troll the dice.
[45:09.890 --> 45:11.370]  Hey Mike, thanks for hanging out with me again, bro.
[45:11.370 --> 45:12.490]  This has been a fun podcast.
[45:12.490 --> 45:14.130]  I didn't give you much room to talk in this one,
[45:14.130 --> 45:15.330]  but you make a great co-host.
[45:15.330 --> 45:16.970]  I've met a great show buddy.
[45:16.970 --> 45:17.810]  You're good, man.
[45:17.810 --> 45:19.090]  You're good.
[45:19.090 --> 45:20.490]  Man, that looks delicious.
[45:21.530 --> 45:22.530]  Yeah, it's wonderful.
