[00:09.720 --> 00:10.720]  Heart podcast.
[00:10.720 --> 00:13.620]  In this episode, I'm going to read a few emails.
[00:13.620 --> 00:17.880]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:17.880 --> 00:22.920]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[00:22.920 --> 00:24.200]  level or higher.

[00:52.040 --> 00:54.320]  my friend Freak Fish.

[00:58.040 --> 01:01.440]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,

[01:10.000 --> 01:14.120]  And of course, I did include a link in the show notes and in the video description to
[01:14.120 --> 01:17.680]  make it super easy for all of my friends.
[01:17.680 --> 01:22.000]  Once again, you guys thank you for all of that continued Patreon support.
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.240]  Sometimes it does blow my mind to open up Patreon and see all the support the messages,
[01:26.240 --> 01:27.840]  the interactions, the love.
[01:27.840 --> 01:29.120]  It does mean a lot to me.
[01:29.120 --> 01:30.320]  So really, thank you.
[01:30.320 --> 01:31.640]  I do appreciate it.
[01:31.640 --> 01:32.640]  All right.
[01:32.640 --> 01:36.000]  Also, I owe you guys a big thank you for all of the birthday love.
[01:36.000 --> 01:37.000]  That's right.
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.880]  On the last episode, I mentioned that show came out on my birthday.
[01:39.880 --> 01:45.960]  My inbox, my YouTube, my social media, my life went haywire with birthday love, birthday
[01:45.960 --> 01:46.960]  messages.
[01:46.960 --> 01:48.160]  It felt amazing.
[01:48.160 --> 01:49.160]  So thank you.
[01:49.160 --> 01:56.240]  It does mean a lot to me to get so many very warm greetings, very well put deep thought
[01:56.240 --> 01:59.280]  out messages from people wishing me a happy birthday.
[01:59.280 --> 02:01.660]  Some people sent some really great messages.
[02:01.660 --> 02:03.080]  Some people just said happy birthday.
[02:03.080 --> 02:05.820]  Some people sent a nice elaborate message.
[02:05.820 --> 02:06.820]  Thank you.
[02:06.820 --> 02:08.160]  I do appreciate all of the above.
[02:08.160 --> 02:13.280]  Also, I got a lot of great gifts from friends, fans, listeners, from the family, from the
[02:13.280 --> 02:14.540]  iRi Army.
[02:14.540 --> 02:15.540]  Thank you.
[02:15.540 --> 02:17.640]  I do appreciate every single one of those gifts.
[02:17.640 --> 02:19.120]  Some of them are very thoughtful gifts.
[02:19.120 --> 02:20.200]  Just like gloves and hats.
[02:20.200 --> 02:21.200]  That shit is thoughtful.
[02:21.200 --> 02:22.200]  Thank you guys.
[02:22.200 --> 02:23.320]  I got drumsticks.
[02:23.320 --> 02:24.320]  I got a lot of great things.
[02:24.320 --> 02:26.120]  I don't want to go talking about gifts that I was given.
[02:26.120 --> 02:27.120]  I got shoes.
[02:27.120 --> 02:28.280]  You guys, I'm a shoe head.
[02:28.280 --> 02:29.760]  I'm a drummer and it's cold.
[02:29.760 --> 02:32.440]  So clothing to keep me warm was beautiful.
[02:32.440 --> 02:35.480]  Drumsticks were amazing and shoes are one of my favorite things.
[02:35.480 --> 02:37.120]  I got a shoe cleaning kit from somebody.
[02:37.120 --> 02:38.400]  You guys know who you are.
[02:38.400 --> 02:42.440]  Big thanks to everybody who gave me some amazing, beautiful birthday gifts.
[02:42.440 --> 02:44.840]  And most of all, that birthday love did mean a lot.
[02:44.840 --> 02:45.840]  Thank you.
[02:45.840 --> 02:46.840]  I feel like I'm rambling.
[02:46.840 --> 02:48.680]  Let's move forward from that.
[02:48.680 --> 02:51.900]  Happy birthday if it's your birthday and if your birthday is coming up this year, happy
[02:51.900 --> 02:54.880]  birthday to you because the birthday love does feel good.
[02:54.880 --> 02:55.880]  Discord.
[02:55.880 --> 02:59.480]  You guys, I have got an iRi Genetics Discord channel.
[02:59.480 --> 03:01.160]  I will put the link right here in the video.
[03:01.160 --> 03:02.960]  You can see it on the screen right now.
[03:02.960 --> 03:04.920]  The link is also in the video description.
[03:04.920 --> 03:05.920]  So look for that.
[03:05.920 --> 03:10.880]  The iRi Genetics, iRi Army, Grow From Your Heart podcast, all things Rasta Jeff Discord
[03:10.880 --> 03:12.640]  channel is a good time.
[03:12.640 --> 03:13.920]  The Discord is blowing up.
[03:13.920 --> 03:16.200]  The server has been getting a lot of boosts.
[03:16.200 --> 03:21.320]  Yesterday, after my birthday celebration on the Monday Night Live feed, I hung out in
[03:21.320 --> 03:23.800]  the Discord neighborhood chat.
[03:23.800 --> 03:26.960]  I will include a link to that in the show notes here.
[03:26.960 --> 03:31.400]  There is a Discord chat where I hang out on video, take dabs with the crew.
[03:31.400 --> 03:32.480]  Anybody is welcome.
[03:32.480 --> 03:33.600]  Anybody is invited.
[03:33.600 --> 03:36.840]  If you can figure out how to make Discord work, how to make that chat work, and how
[03:36.840 --> 03:39.740]  to get in there, that's the only test there is.
[03:39.740 --> 03:41.280]  Come in, agree to the rules.
[03:41.280 --> 03:44.660]  The rules are that the neighborhood is always right and you won't be a dick.
[03:44.660 --> 03:45.840]  So come on in and hang out.
[03:45.840 --> 03:50.560]  If you can agree to those rules, like I said before, if you can make Discord work and if
[03:50.560 --> 03:54.520]  you can get through all the hoops that Discord makes you do to get to our live chat, you're
[03:54.520 --> 03:55.520]  more than welcome.
[03:55.520 --> 03:56.520]  You're more than invited.
[03:56.520 --> 04:01.240]  I make no promises as to how frequently, how often, what kind of schedule I'm going to
[04:01.240 --> 04:03.440]  adhere to being in that live chat.
[04:03.440 --> 04:06.900]  When I've got some time to kill, maybe when I'm packing up seeds, I like to just put on
[04:06.900 --> 04:10.080]  some headphones, turn on a microphone and hang out with my friends and take some dabs
[04:10.080 --> 04:11.240]  in there.
[04:11.240 --> 04:14.640]  During these quarantine times, during these lockdown times, if you're listening in the
[04:14.640 --> 04:17.760]  future right now, we are still in sort of a quarantine situation.
[04:17.760 --> 04:20.520]  We're not allowed to play with our friends as much as we'd like.
[04:20.520 --> 04:24.360]  During these sort of times, it's really nice to have something like a Zoom chat, like the
[04:24.360 --> 04:30.080]  Discord chat, things like that, to be interactive with more fellow smokers, growers, stoners,
[04:30.080 --> 04:31.080]  like-minded friends.
[04:31.080 --> 04:35.040]  And it's also a beautiful way for me to keep in touch with the IRE army, with the crew,
[04:35.040 --> 04:38.120]  the people that are growing my strains, the people that support me.
[04:38.120 --> 04:41.000]  I really like hanging out with you guys and just chilling out.
[04:41.000 --> 04:42.820]  I'm taking dabs, kicking back.
[04:42.820 --> 04:44.600]  You guys get to ask me questions.
[04:44.600 --> 04:47.600]  It's funny because sometimes people come in, they're a little bit, I hate to say the word
[04:47.600 --> 04:49.720]  starstruck, but they've been following me for a while.
[04:49.720 --> 04:50.720]  They've been watching the show.
[04:50.720 --> 04:52.800]  They come in and they're like, holy shit, there he is.
[04:52.800 --> 04:53.800]  They don't know what to say.
[04:53.800 --> 04:55.480]  They don't know what to do.
[04:55.480 --> 04:57.240]  I just welcome you, say what's up.
[04:57.240 --> 04:58.920]  We take some dabs, we hang out.
[04:58.920 --> 05:00.760]  I act like it's just no big deal.
[05:00.760 --> 05:02.200]  And eventually everyone's just hanging out.
[05:02.200 --> 05:03.200]  It's no big deal.
[05:03.200 --> 05:06.560]  I'm taking dabs with everybody, cheersing everybody, talking about whatever's on my
[05:06.560 --> 05:07.560]  mind.
[05:07.560 --> 05:08.940]  You're talking about whatever's on your mind.
[05:08.940 --> 05:12.160]  So it's fun once everybody comes in and just settles down, the starstruck feeling goes
[05:12.160 --> 05:13.160]  away.
[05:13.160 --> 05:14.440]  It's a fun place for people just to hang out, chill out.
[05:14.440 --> 05:17.400]  It's a spot for me to be interactive, a spot for you to be interactive.
[05:17.400 --> 05:18.760]  I get some social feed there.
[05:18.760 --> 05:20.960]  You get some social interaction there.
[05:20.960 --> 05:26.120]  So my point is the discord is blowing up and the discord hang and the neighborhood has
[05:26.120 --> 05:27.160]  become a lot of fun.
[05:27.160 --> 05:28.820]  So I invite you guys to come hang out.
[05:28.820 --> 05:29.820]  You're more than welcome.
[05:29.820 --> 05:30.820]  You're more than invited.
[05:30.820 --> 05:33.760]  I would love to see your smiling faces on camera.
[05:33.760 --> 05:34.900]  You don't have to cam up.
[05:34.900 --> 05:38.240]  You can put up a little icon, a little logo on the screen if you'd like to.
[05:38.240 --> 05:41.520]  We'll just see a picture of whatever you would like when you're on the camera, but we'd love
[05:41.520 --> 05:42.840]  you to join the conversation.
[05:42.840 --> 05:44.640]  Come hang out, share the vibe.
[05:44.640 --> 05:48.680]  There will be a link in the video description, the show notes.
[05:48.680 --> 05:52.600]  And also I will try to type it right up here somewhere on the screen so that you can see
[05:52.600 --> 05:54.560]  that, have an idea of where to go.
[05:54.560 --> 05:56.560]  If you're new to discord, be patient.
[05:56.560 --> 05:57.560]  There's a little bit to learn.
[05:57.560 --> 05:59.120]  It's a little bit overwhelming.
[05:59.120 --> 06:01.160]  Once you figure it out, it is a really good time.
[06:01.160 --> 06:03.280]  So that's enough rambling on discord.
[06:03.280 --> 06:08.200]  I invite you to join us on the Irie Genetics discord.
[06:08.200 --> 06:12.400]  Once again, shout out to all the fine ladies and gentlemen who not only participate in
[06:12.960 --> 06:13.960]  there, but also run that discord.
[06:13.960 --> 06:17.280]  There are a lot of great people who do a lot of great things to make sure it works.
[06:17.280 --> 06:22.320]  I did not realize people were putting so much time and energy and effort and also money
[06:22.320 --> 06:24.720]  into the Irie Genetics discord.
[06:24.720 --> 06:26.960]  That's basically built for me.
[06:26.960 --> 06:28.240]  It's I'm Irie Genetics.
[06:28.240 --> 06:32.440]  It's also, but it's the community that's doing it, running it, functioning it, make it happen,
[06:32.440 --> 06:33.480]  making it happen.
[06:33.480 --> 06:38.680]  So thank you to the fucking Irie Army, the Grow From Your Heart crew, the Rasta Jeff
[06:38.680 --> 06:41.820]  team, team Irie Genetics, whatever you guys want to call yourselves.
[06:41.820 --> 06:42.820]  You know who you are.
[06:42.820 --> 06:45.180]  If you deserve some credit, feel it in your heart right now.
[06:45.180 --> 06:46.420]  Feel this fist bump I'm giving you.
[06:46.420 --> 06:47.980]  Feel the kiss I'm going to give the mic.
[06:47.980 --> 06:51.460]  That was for you for being a good little soldier.
[06:51.460 --> 06:52.460]  Thank you.
[06:52.460 --> 06:53.460]  I appreciate it.
[06:53.460 --> 06:56.180]  Big salute to everyone in the discord, the Irie Army for helping me out.
[06:56.180 --> 07:01.220]  Then I want to say thanks to all of, it's weird calling you fans, supporters, listeners,
[07:01.220 --> 07:04.780]  viewers, the army, the crew, the gang that is learning from me.
[07:04.780 --> 07:09.420]  Thank you guys for all of the love, the support, and most of all, the trust.
[07:09.420 --> 07:15.740]  You guys, you've got to have huge trust in me to take my advice to run your garden.
[07:15.740 --> 07:18.300]  A lot of you are relying on your garden for several things.
[07:18.300 --> 07:19.680]  Maybe it's medicine.
[07:19.680 --> 07:21.100]  Maybe it's how you're paying the bills.
[07:21.100 --> 07:22.440]  Maybe it's a little bit of both.
[07:22.440 --> 07:24.860]  Maybe it's your therapy while you're gardening.
[07:24.860 --> 07:26.620]  Then it's your therapy when you're trimming.
[07:26.620 --> 07:29.100]  Then it's your financial survival when you flip it.
[07:29.100 --> 07:30.900]  Then it's also your medicine when you smoke it.
[07:30.900 --> 07:32.780]  You use that flip to cover the cost.
[07:32.780 --> 07:37.900]  You guys are trusting me with a lot and I understand how much trust you're putting in
[07:37.900 --> 07:39.060]  me basically.
[07:39.060 --> 07:41.940]  I appreciate that you trust me that much.
[07:41.940 --> 07:42.940]  Thank you.
[07:42.940 --> 07:48.660]  That is fucking awesome that you guys support me and you trust me that much with your garden.
[07:48.660 --> 07:50.460]  I'm basically writing you instructions.
[07:50.460 --> 07:51.460]  You're like, what do I do?
[07:51.460 --> 07:52.780]  I say, do this.
[07:52.780 --> 07:56.920]  Most of the time, you guys go and execute my instructions and you're having great success.
[07:56.920 --> 07:57.920]  Thank you for the trust.
[07:57.920 --> 07:59.140]  I appreciate that.
[07:59.140 --> 08:02.820]  Thank you for the support, not only on the podcast, not only in everything that I try
[08:02.820 --> 08:05.140]  to do, but my seed company is thriving.
[08:05.140 --> 08:07.260]  My social media is thriving.
[08:07.260 --> 08:09.020]  Life is good for Rasta Jeff.
[08:09.020 --> 08:12.220]  I read genetics, the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[08:12.220 --> 08:13.900]  Without you guys, it would not be a thing.
[08:13.900 --> 08:16.540]  You guys, gals, everybody out there listening.
[08:16.540 --> 08:20.500]  Without you, I would just be some weirdo with the microphone and hopes and dreams.
[08:20.500 --> 08:21.500]  Thank you.
[08:21.500 --> 08:22.500]  I do appreciate it.
[08:22.500 --> 08:28.020]  It does not go unnoticed that you guys have built a huge community around the vibe, the
[08:28.020 --> 08:30.780]  company, the idea that I created.
[08:30.780 --> 08:31.780]  Thank you.
[08:31.780 --> 08:35.580]  That means a lot to me to see it thriving, to see it flourish, especially in these weird
[08:35.580 --> 08:37.700]  times.
[08:37.700 --> 08:42.620]  Not only are we in a pandemic situation, we're also, a lot of people are financially strapped.
[08:42.620 --> 08:47.380]  People don't have a lot of extra money because of this pandemic situation.
[08:47.380 --> 08:49.460]  You choose to financially support me.
[08:49.460 --> 08:50.460]  That means a lot to me.
[08:50.460 --> 08:55.500]  Also, there are hundreds, if not thousands of shows to watch, support, listen to, spend
[08:55.500 --> 09:00.700]  your time, money, energy on viewing, clicking like, supporting, encouraging, loving.
[09:00.700 --> 09:02.380]  You choose to do that to me.
[09:02.380 --> 09:05.680]  That means a lot for me, to me, with me, however you want to put it.
[09:05.680 --> 09:07.340]  You financially support me.
[09:07.500 --> 09:11.780]  I do make a living from the podcast and through my seed company and through my consultations.
[09:11.780 --> 09:12.780]  So you support me.
[09:12.780 --> 09:14.700]  You do help me make a living.
[09:14.700 --> 09:15.960]  That means a lot to me.
[09:15.960 --> 09:18.640]  You click like on all of my videos.
[09:18.640 --> 09:20.140]  You could be watching other videos.
[09:20.140 --> 09:24.540]  I've got 10 friends that make their own videos that are probably watching my show right now.
[09:24.540 --> 09:29.780]  So thank you to everybody that chooses to watch me, support me, support my company,
[09:29.780 --> 09:30.780]  support my Patreon.
[09:30.780 --> 09:34.300]  There are a lot of podcasts out there with Patreons and you choose to support mine.
[09:34.300 --> 09:35.300]  You guys, I appreciate it.
[09:35.300 --> 09:37.420]  I'm rushing, just feeling the vibe.
[09:37.420 --> 09:41.780]  I had a birthday, feeling the love, wanted to return the love back to you guys.
[09:41.780 --> 09:47.540]  And make sure you guys know that I'm not just sucking up rewards and not feeling the appreciation
[09:47.540 --> 09:51.620]  for the love, respect, and support that I'm getting from you guys.
[09:51.620 --> 09:55.880]  I said it a minute ago, without you, I wouldn't be successful.
[09:55.880 --> 10:00.100]  So thank each and every one of you, no matter how much you feel like you did or did not,
[10:00.100 --> 10:02.260]  your large or small contribution.
[10:02.260 --> 10:03.260]  Thank you.
[10:03.260 --> 10:04.260]  I appreciate that.
[10:04.260 --> 10:05.260]  It's huge.
[10:05.260 --> 10:06.700]  And it's happening without me.
[10:06.700 --> 10:08.260]  You guys are on Discord.
[10:08.260 --> 10:11.820]  Somebody is on Discord in the Discord chat right now while I'm recording.
[10:11.820 --> 10:15.340]  People are in Discord answering Grow From Your Heart questions.
[10:15.340 --> 10:20.940]  Purple Thumb is probably posting a link how to sell iRegenetics merchandise.
[10:20.940 --> 10:24.780]  Dave's Not Here is running an auction right now for me on Discord while I'm chilling right
[10:24.780 --> 10:25.940]  here.
[10:25.940 --> 10:27.180]  There's a lot of stuff happening.
[10:27.180 --> 10:30.260]  Somebody is probably answering a Grow question on the Discord.
[10:30.260 --> 10:33.860]  My web guy is updating web stuff just randomly for me.
[10:33.860 --> 10:34.860]  You guys are amazing.
[10:34.860 --> 10:35.860]  So thank you for all of that.
[10:35.860 --> 10:37.920]  The shit is happening when I'm recording.
[10:37.920 --> 10:38.920]  You guys are doing things.
[10:38.920 --> 10:41.140]  When I'm asleep, the Discord is going.
[10:41.140 --> 10:44.500]  The iRe army is still out there conquering, getting shit done.
[10:44.500 --> 10:48.140]  When I'm enjoying my weekend, that Discord keeps running when I'm not even there.
[10:48.140 --> 10:49.140]  So it's amazing.
[10:49.140 --> 10:50.140]  Thank you guys.
[10:50.140 --> 10:52.340]  Big shout out to the iRe army.
[10:52.340 --> 10:56.660]  I said it jokingly the other night, the iRe army, we take more dabs before 9 a.m. than
[10:56.660 --> 10:58.260]  most people do all day.
[10:58.260 --> 10:59.580]  And we still kick ass.
[10:59.580 --> 11:00.580]  We get shit done.
[11:00.580 --> 11:02.060]  We're kind to each other.
[11:02.060 --> 11:03.060]  We got awesome gardens.
[11:03.260 --> 11:04.260]  We got good families.
[11:04.260 --> 11:05.260]  We're good people.
[11:05.260 --> 11:08.580]  And we still have time to hang out in that Discord chat at like 4 in the morning.
[11:08.580 --> 11:10.340]  So it's a huge community.
[11:10.340 --> 11:11.340]  And I'm overwhelmed.
[11:11.340 --> 11:15.700]  If you can't tell, I've been gushing for several minutes about this, but I appreciate it.
[11:15.700 --> 11:18.940]  Here's the morbid thought that I had.
[11:18.940 --> 11:19.940]  Excuse that throat clearing.
[11:19.940 --> 11:22.740]  I did take some gnarly dabs a minute ago.
[11:22.740 --> 11:27.680]  The morbid thought that I had was I could pass away now, this moment, as long as this
[11:27.680 --> 11:32.180]  episode makes it out and you guys get my gratitude, I could pass away right now.
[11:32.300 --> 11:38.500]  And this company, this podcast, this idea that I created will still thrive for at least
[11:38.500 --> 11:42.300]  a decade to come until YouTube deletes my episodes.
[11:42.300 --> 11:43.700]  They'll stay up there.
[11:43.700 --> 11:47.020]  We've got a friend Subcool who passed away like a year ago.
[11:47.020 --> 11:48.740]  Rest in peace and shout out to Subcool.
[11:48.740 --> 11:52.160]  I still watch his videos.
[11:52.160 --> 11:54.140]  So with that, I'm still keeping Subby alive.
[11:54.140 --> 11:56.180]  You guys will continue to watch my videos for a year.
[11:56.180 --> 11:57.540]  I'm sure of that.
[11:57.540 --> 12:00.460]  Also, I'm still growing Subcool seeds.
[12:00.460 --> 12:04.700]  So that tells me that when I'm gone, hopefully somebody out there is still growing my seeds
[12:04.700 --> 12:05.940]  for generations.
[12:05.940 --> 12:09.300]  Then maybe somebody will breed with them just like I did for Sub.
[12:09.300 --> 12:10.300]  Sub's gone.
[12:10.300 --> 12:11.300]  I took some of his stuff.
[12:11.300 --> 12:12.680]  I bred it to keep Subby alive.
[12:12.680 --> 12:16.940]  The man may be gone, but his work, his legend, his idea, his vibe will continue.
[12:16.940 --> 12:20.340]  It's partly my job, I felt, to continue that.
[12:20.340 --> 12:24.640]  So somebody in the ivory army, I have a good feeling of who a few of those people may be.
[12:24.640 --> 12:25.860]  Some of them I don't even know.
[12:25.860 --> 12:29.540]  I'm sure there are people out there kicking ass with my genetics doing work for me that
[12:29.620 --> 12:30.620]  I don't even know yet.
[12:30.620 --> 12:31.620]  Shout out, thank you.
[12:31.620 --> 12:35.860]  But there are a few people I have in mind that I know if I were to pass right now, some
[12:35.860 --> 12:38.340]  of those people would continue the ivory work.
[12:38.340 --> 12:41.780]  My strains would be crossed to other things and crossed with themselves.
[12:41.780 --> 12:43.940]  I know people would continue the vibe.
[12:43.940 --> 12:47.580]  The website would be continued to survive for quite a while.
[12:47.580 --> 12:49.260]  It comes from a bank account.
[12:49.260 --> 12:52.140]  Until that bank account is drained, the website would exist.
[12:52.140 --> 12:56.260]  So if I passed away at this moment, after I put out this podcast, we'll say just after
[12:56.260 --> 12:58.800]  I hit post, you guys get to hear this.
[12:58.800 --> 13:03.480]  This company, iRegenetics, this podcast, the Grow From Your Heart podcast will survive
[13:03.480 --> 13:09.480]  indefinitely, possibly infinitely, as long as YouTube goes on, this exists, which is
[13:09.480 --> 13:10.600]  fucking cool.
[13:10.600 --> 13:14.240]  As long as you guys are growing and breeding and taking care of the clones and seeds, the
[13:14.240 --> 13:18.720]  vibe, the idea that I created now at this point will last almost indefinitely.
[13:18.720 --> 13:20.420]  And that's fucking beautiful.
[13:20.420 --> 13:21.560]  Keep it going, you guys.
[13:21.560 --> 13:25.000]  I don't plan on going anywhere, but I'm just saying, keep it going.
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.000]  Let's spread this forever.
[13:26.240 --> 13:27.240]  I did this all.
[13:27.240 --> 13:29.520]  It's called the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[13:29.520 --> 13:34.880]  The slogan behind iRegenetics used to be, grow from your heart and breed with love.
[13:34.880 --> 13:39.120]  We kind of separated the two entities to have two different LLCs here, but grow from your
[13:39.120 --> 13:40.120]  heart, man.
[13:40.120 --> 13:41.280]  That's always what it's been about.
[13:41.280 --> 13:45.400]  So I feel like I'm rambling, but just keep growing from your heart, you guys, and it'll
[13:45.400 --> 13:46.400]  keep going.
[13:46.400 --> 13:48.080]  So I'm spreading that love, spreading that vibe is my point.
[13:48.080 --> 13:50.480]  Anyway, I do have some topics for this podcast.
[13:50.480 --> 13:52.920]  It's not just going to be me rambling for the whole show.
[13:53.240 --> 13:56.520]  Well, actually it is, but we've got some topics for me to ramble about.
[13:56.520 --> 13:57.520]  Let's jump right into it.
[13:57.520 --> 13:59.720]  This one came from my email inbox.
[13:59.720 --> 14:03.880]  Of course, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[14:03.880 --> 14:08.080]  If you've got any grow questions, cannabis concerns, cannabis culture, cannabis community
[14:08.080 --> 14:11.000]  questions, I'd love to answer that stuff here on the show.
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.000]  Here we go.
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.160]  The first one says, have you done a show about which companies are owned by Hawthorne or
[14:15.160 --> 14:19.040]  plan on doing that episode?
[14:19.040 --> 14:20.400]  Maybe some people are going, that's random.
[14:20.400 --> 14:22.480]  Why do we care about what's owned by Hawthorne?
[14:23.040 --> 14:24.040]  That's a really good question.
[14:24.040 --> 14:28.160]  I'm not going to do a specific episode on companies which are owned by Hawthorne, but
[14:28.160 --> 14:33.360]  this will set me up for a good rant, which goes a lot like this.
[14:33.360 --> 14:37.120]  I'm not going to bash or roast any certain brands or companies.
[14:37.120 --> 14:39.180]  We know who we shouldn't support.
[14:39.180 --> 14:44.080]  Most of us know who we should not be supporting, who the big devils are in agriculture, in
[14:44.080 --> 14:50.520]  commercial, in the world, in capitalism, in just politics, in fucking economics.
[14:50.560 --> 14:54.720]  We know who we should be avoiding, who we should be avoiding.
[14:54.720 --> 14:56.520]  I'm an older guy by now.
[14:56.520 --> 14:57.520]  I'm 42 years old.
[14:57.520 --> 15:01.600]  I've got a good idea of where my money should go and who's getting my money and who makes
[15:01.600 --> 15:03.960]  what, and who runs what at this point.
[15:03.960 --> 15:09.760]  Maybe some of you guys haven't put too much thought about where the money goes.
[15:09.760 --> 15:11.120]  Here's the thing to think about.
[15:11.120 --> 15:14.320]  This guy is saying, have I done a show about Hawthorne?
[15:14.320 --> 15:17.760]  Hawthorne is a big company that owns a lot of things.
[15:17.760 --> 15:19.360]  They may not have the best values.
[15:19.360 --> 15:23.280]  They may not have the best views on keeping the world safe and healthy.
[15:23.280 --> 15:26.120]  They may not be the best at keeping humans safe and healthy.
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.640]  They may be focused more on the dollars than the long-term effects of human safety, environmental
[15:31.640 --> 15:33.840]  safety and environmental impact.
[15:33.840 --> 15:38.360]  We're going to do a little talk about avoiding those types of companies.
[15:38.360 --> 15:40.600]  Basically, Scotty Real puts it best.
[15:40.600 --> 15:43.600]  Scotty Real says, vote with your dollars, man.
[15:43.600 --> 15:46.000]  We're going to talk about voting with our dollars.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.420]  The word I wrote was conscious spending.
[15:48.460 --> 15:52.300]  The other thing I wrote on my flow chart here was follow the money, man.
[15:52.300 --> 15:58.060]  When you're shopping for ... I'm going to focus this on gross supplies, nutrients, soil,
[15:58.060 --> 15:59.060]  soilless mix.
[15:59.060 --> 16:02.940]  We'll go as far as saying lights and equipment, anything in your grow.
[16:02.940 --> 16:05.860]  This could apply to anything in your life.
[16:05.860 --> 16:09.420]  Wherever you're spending money, time, energy, is it worth it?
[16:09.420 --> 16:13.620]  Is it somewhere you want to spend your hard-earned money, time, energy?
[16:13.620 --> 16:15.100]  Money is expensive, man.
[16:15.100 --> 16:16.380]  You work hard for it.
[16:16.380 --> 16:19.940]  You've got to do something you don't want to do for a certain amount of time.
[16:19.940 --> 16:23.180]  Probably unless you're blessed and have it really lucky, you're probably working for
[16:23.180 --> 16:26.820]  somebody you don't like, who doesn't appreciate you, that doesn't see how hard you work, that
[16:26.820 --> 16:30.500]  doesn't understand how hard your struggle is, and it sucks.
[16:30.500 --> 16:31.580]  Money's expensive.
[16:31.580 --> 16:34.780]  Putting in your time and energy to get money, that is expensive.
[16:34.780 --> 16:36.580]  Follow the money when you're spending it.
[16:36.580 --> 16:38.020]  Do you want to spend that money?
[16:38.020 --> 16:41.420]  If you know that when you buy a product, you may have two options.
[16:41.420 --> 16:46.740]  Is the company that you buy a product from, does company A use that money to reforest
[16:46.740 --> 16:48.900]  the rainforest or some shit?
[16:48.900 --> 16:54.020]  Does the other company use that money to shoot babies on Sundays?
[16:54.020 --> 16:55.260]  Who are you spending your money with?
[16:55.260 --> 16:59.460]  We already know we're going to save the rainforest, not shoot babies on Sunday, right?
[16:59.460 --> 17:01.500]  That's an easy way to decide how to spend your money.
[17:01.500 --> 17:04.380]  Do a little research on where the money goes once you spend it.
[17:04.380 --> 17:05.820]  What are you going to do with it, bro?
[17:05.820 --> 17:09.020]  Are you going to support a presidential candidate that we're not up for?
[17:09.060 --> 17:12.700]  Are you going to support a presidential candidate that is on cannabis's side?
[17:12.700 --> 17:17.020]  Because why are you going to spend your money with a company who is against the thing that
[17:17.020 --> 17:19.180]  you're buying their product to do?
[17:19.180 --> 17:22.620]  So I don't want to be political, but also kind of, it's not just political.
[17:22.620 --> 17:23.820]  This is a personal thing.
[17:23.820 --> 17:26.540]  This is a personal decision.
[17:26.540 --> 17:29.980]  This is some things, a conscious decision we need to start making.
[17:29.980 --> 17:32.180]  Maybe some people aren't aware of that.
[17:32.180 --> 17:37.220]  Does your contribution go to a good cause or does your contribution go to more research
[17:37.300 --> 17:42.180]  to create more products that are not going to be desirable for our planet, our world?
[17:42.180 --> 17:45.620]  I'm trying not to bash too many specific companies, say too many names.
[17:45.620 --> 17:48.940]  We all know that Monsanto is the devil, that Scott's is the devil.
[17:48.940 --> 17:52.740]  Anybody that falls in that umbrella, we may not want to give them our money.
[17:52.740 --> 17:59.540]  If you've got the option to give your money to a mom and pop shop, a bro and chick owned
[17:59.540 --> 18:04.380]  shop in your neighborhood, maybe some lady that's been in the grow community opened up
[18:04.380 --> 18:05.860]  a new hydro store.
[18:05.860 --> 18:06.860]  Go shop there.
[18:07.500 --> 18:08.500]  Avoid that big box shop.
[18:08.500 --> 18:12.540]  If you can, I understand that some people, some places, some locations, the only thing
[18:12.540 --> 18:14.460]  you've got is that big chain store.
[18:14.460 --> 18:15.460]  You have to go to Lowe's.
[18:15.460 --> 18:16.620]  You may have to go to home Depot.
[18:16.620 --> 18:21.260]  You may have to hit the Walmart, but if there's a small shop that is available, it may be
[18:21.260 --> 18:26.460]  a dollar or two more to shop there, but it's worth your time, effort, and energy to support
[18:26.460 --> 18:27.740]  that family.
[18:27.740 --> 18:34.420]  When you buy something from Bill's garden supply store, Bill gets to buy himself a truck
[18:34.500 --> 18:38.180]  and drive around in that truck so that he could take his kids to school.
[18:38.180 --> 18:41.380]  Bill gets to buy his kids school clothes.
[18:41.380 --> 18:46.180]  You're not just going to Walmart so that Walmart, so that Sam Walton, I know he's gone, but
[18:46.180 --> 18:50.820]  the Walmart family can buy more jets and Ferraris and Corvettes and fly around and treat their
[18:50.820 --> 18:52.220]  employees like shit.
[18:52.220 --> 18:55.700]  If you go over to Bill's, Bill is probably the guy working there, so Bill's going to
[18:55.700 --> 18:59.980]  treat you with kindness, treat you with respect, and appreciate your business and appreciate
[18:59.980 --> 19:02.260]  you shopping there.
[19:02.260 --> 19:05.900]  Just like I do when you choose to support my brand, my company, whether it's the Grow
[19:05.900 --> 19:10.860]  From Your Heart podcast or the iRegenetic seeds, Bill is going to appreciate that.
[19:10.860 --> 19:11.980]  Follow the money.
[19:11.980 --> 19:17.500]  Also, if you don't shop at that small mom and pop shop every time you need something,
[19:17.500 --> 19:21.780]  when you do need something that only they carry, that place might not be there.
[19:21.780 --> 19:25.100]  If you go to Walmart, if you go to Home Depot, if you go to Lowe's and you've got a couple
[19:25.100 --> 19:29.180]  of questions, hey Bill, what's the best way to do this?
[19:29.500 --> 19:32.820]  You get somebody at Home Depot or Lowe's that's slightly competent.
[19:32.820 --> 19:35.820]  Competent, that might be the word I tried to say.
[19:35.820 --> 19:40.060]  But if you go talk to Bill at Bill's Hardware, Bill will have six or seven different ideas
[19:40.060 --> 19:41.060]  on how to do it.
[19:41.060 --> 19:42.940]  He'll find out which is the best idea for you.
[19:42.940 --> 19:46.180]  He'll walk you up and down the aisles, build you a little shopping cart of the shit that's
[19:46.180 --> 19:49.740]  going to work best for you, shake your hand and wish you the best and send you on your
[19:49.740 --> 19:50.740]  way.
[19:50.740 --> 19:53.140]  When you come back in two or three days with pictures of the job on your phone, Bill's
[19:53.140 --> 19:54.540]  going to high five you.
[19:54.540 --> 19:55.540]  You guys are going to be friends.
[19:55.540 --> 19:57.140]  You're going to be part of the community.
[19:57.140 --> 20:01.180]  Just walking into a big box, being another zombie with a credit card, leaving with a
[20:01.180 --> 20:05.220]  bunch of plastic shit, going home and hoping you've got what you've got and giving our
[20:05.220 --> 20:07.780]  money to the Waltons and China.
[20:07.780 --> 20:12.380]  So that was kind of a weird long rant for a podcast about cannabis, but let's follow
[20:12.380 --> 20:14.300]  the money when we're shopping.
[20:14.300 --> 20:19.900]  Let's follow the money, conscious spending, conscious shopping, conscious consuming.
[20:19.900 --> 20:21.140]  Vote with your dollars, man.
[20:21.140 --> 20:23.020]  That's basically what I'm trying to say.
[20:23.020 --> 20:29.100]  So when you're going to buy a product, if you can buy a locally sourced product, if
[20:29.100 --> 20:32.580]  you can, I understand that not everything is made everywhere.
[20:32.580 --> 20:33.920]  Buy something local.
[20:33.920 --> 20:37.740]  If it's not made local, buy it from a store that is local.
[20:37.740 --> 20:41.940]  And if not, then think about where is the money going once I buy this?
[20:41.940 --> 20:46.460]  Hopefully it goes to a local grocery store so that Bill's grocery store gets to pay their
[20:46.460 --> 20:47.460]  bills.
[20:47.460 --> 20:48.460]  They get to pay the light bill.
[20:48.460 --> 20:49.460]  They get to pay the rent.
[20:49.460 --> 20:52.500]  Then Bill gets to pay his mortgage and buy some groceries, take care of the family.
[20:52.500 --> 20:54.860]  That's always a feel good feeling, right?
[20:54.860 --> 20:59.780]  Then hopefully that money is going to a company that is making a quality product and not using
[20:59.780 --> 21:04.500]  a bunch of crappy imported or half-assed ingredients.
[21:04.500 --> 21:08.020]  Hopefully we're trying to keep our money close to home with people that we care about instead
[21:08.020 --> 21:11.900]  of just watching it go blindly to causes which we do not support.
[21:11.900 --> 21:15.660]  All right, I feel like I've spent enough time on that message.
[21:15.660 --> 21:18.500]  Let's see, do you want your name shouted out?
[21:18.500 --> 21:22.380]  I don't see your name on here at all, so I'm not going to give you a shout out by name,
[21:22.460 --> 21:23.740]  but you know who you are.
[21:23.740 --> 21:28.340]  Thank you for the great message and thank you for sparking a great line of ranting on
[21:28.340 --> 21:30.340]  this episode of the podcast.
[21:30.340 --> 21:35.340]  All right, this next message came from the Grow Help tab on my website.
[21:35.340 --> 21:36.340]  That's right.
[21:36.340 --> 21:40.740]  If you go to the website, iRegenetics.com, on the top bar there is a Grow Help tab.
[21:40.740 --> 21:41.740]  Click on that.
[21:41.740 --> 21:45.120]  You will be able to ask a grow question and ask for grow advice.
[21:45.120 --> 21:48.000]  We do ask a few preliminary questions before we get there.
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.860]  We ask your name, what strain you're growing, if you're growing indoors or outdoors.
[21:51.860 --> 21:55.260]  You will see the questionnaire if you do go to the website and jump on that Grow Help
[21:55.260 --> 21:56.260]  tab.
[21:56.260 --> 21:57.260]  Just click on that.
[21:57.260 --> 21:58.260]  It'll get you right to it.
[21:58.260 --> 21:59.260]  Then you can ask your question.
[21:59.260 --> 22:02.580]  This question comes from our friend Newby Nugs.
[22:02.580 --> 22:05.540]  They're growing granddaddy perpta platinum cookies.
[22:05.540 --> 22:06.660]  They're growing it indoors.
[22:06.660 --> 22:08.340]  They're in flower.
[22:08.340 --> 22:09.420]  Let's see.
[22:09.420 --> 22:13.680]  Let's get right to the question here because it says, my question is on cutting clones
[22:13.680 --> 22:14.680]  for sexing.
[22:14.680 --> 22:16.820]  I've talked about this in a previous episode.
[22:16.820 --> 22:19.660]  If you want to find out if you've got male or female plants and you don't want to wait
[22:19.660 --> 22:22.300]  until they get real big, you can cut a clone.
[22:22.300 --> 22:27.260]  You can put that clone in your rapid router under your dome, put it under 1212 lighting,
[22:27.260 --> 22:30.060]  and quite quickly it will tell you if it's a male or a female.
[22:30.060 --> 22:33.660]  Then you'll know if the plant which that clone came from was a boy or a girl and you know
[22:33.660 --> 22:37.160]  if you need to continue working with that plant or if you can get rid of it.
[22:37.160 --> 22:39.060]  So that catches you up.
[22:39.060 --> 22:44.780]  It says now I am practicing saving for a dragon punch and lemon sunrise for this March.
[22:44.780 --> 22:45.780]  Good choices, my friend.
[22:45.780 --> 22:47.300]  Those will grow well in your garden.
[22:47.300 --> 22:52.480]  It says I've never ran regular seeds as I have a five plant limit over five inches.
[22:52.480 --> 22:57.460]  So I'm practicing and I took one of my cuts of the granddaddy purple candy land plant
[22:57.460 --> 23:02.100]  and put it in soil with Michael Risey and dipped it in cloning gel.
[23:02.100 --> 23:03.460]  So you got a clone.
[23:03.460 --> 23:07.120]  So you've got a five plant limit, which that's very restrictive and you want to grow some
[23:07.120 --> 23:08.120]  regular seeds.
[23:08.120 --> 23:09.120]  That's understandable.
[23:09.120 --> 23:12.260]  We've got to find out which are the males and females so we don't grow the males up
[23:12.260 --> 23:13.980]  too big and waste time.
[23:13.980 --> 23:20.060]  So you are doing a test run to find out how to sex your plants by doing quick clones.
[23:20.060 --> 23:21.060]  You took cuts.
[23:21.060 --> 23:26.100]  You took a cut of the GDP candy land plant, put it in soil with mycos, dipped it in cloning
[23:26.100 --> 23:31.820]  gel, immediately put it into the flowering tent and in a couple of days you had pre flowers.
[23:31.820 --> 23:32.820]  Yes.
[23:32.820 --> 23:34.740]  Sounds like you're doing it right so far.
[23:34.740 --> 23:39.220]  I let it go for another four days, steadily increasing flowering activity.
[23:39.220 --> 23:41.180]  I pulled it and obviously no roots.
[23:41.180 --> 23:45.020]  Yeah, it hasn't had time for roots at that point, but it said I had no proper rooting
[23:45.020 --> 23:46.260]  parameters or dome.
[23:46.260 --> 23:47.260]  It was just a test.
[23:47.260 --> 23:48.460]  I wasn't even in a dome.
[23:48.460 --> 23:49.460]  That's pretty amazing.
[23:49.460 --> 23:54.260]  It's kind of amazing that it lived this long, uh, over four days in there without a dome.
[23:54.260 --> 23:55.260]  That's pretty killer.
[23:55.260 --> 23:56.260]  Good job, man.
[23:56.260 --> 23:57.260]  That's a, that's good luck.
[23:57.260 --> 24:00.620]  It says, is this a typical case on sexing cuts?
[24:00.620 --> 24:05.220]  Does it usually happen this quickly and flower without roots or was I lucky?
[24:05.220 --> 24:11.660]  This would help me in culling males quickly to see what meets our laws here.
[24:11.660 --> 24:14.940]  So it doesn't usually happen that quickly.
[24:14.940 --> 24:19.520]  I think you got kind of lucky with the four days, but usually seven to 10 days you'll
[24:19.520 --> 24:23.260]  be able to tell if you've got males or females within that timeframe.
[24:23.260 --> 24:27.020]  What I think may have happened, and I think we've corresponded since this, uh, what I
[24:27.020 --> 24:30.660]  think may have happened, you may have taken your cuts from the top of the plant and the
[24:30.660 --> 24:32.340]  tops are where there are more hormones.
[24:32.340 --> 24:36.540]  Those plants are a little bit more, or the tops are more ready to go into flower.
[24:36.540 --> 24:40.260]  All the hormones have moved up to the top so that the parts you cut were like, hell
[24:40.260 --> 24:41.780]  yeah, let's go into flower.
[24:41.780 --> 24:45.100]  When he took it away from the main part of the plant, it kind of went into panic mode.
[24:45.100 --> 24:46.620]  It was like, I don't know what the fuck to do, man.
[24:46.620 --> 24:48.200]  He took the roots away from me.
[24:48.200 --> 24:49.700]  You changed the light cycle.
[24:49.700 --> 24:51.420]  So it flowered super quickly.
[24:51.420 --> 24:54.500]  It had a couple of reasons to go into flower really quickly.
[24:54.500 --> 24:56.260]  So I think that is why that happened.
[24:56.260 --> 25:01.060]  Uh, in my experience, that is quicker than it's ever happened than I've ever seen.
[25:01.060 --> 25:02.540]  So you got lucky there.
[25:02.540 --> 25:06.380]  And if it was a male, that's a powerful potent male that I would not breed with.
[25:06.380 --> 25:09.860]  I would skip him because he is too much male for a breeding project.
[25:09.860 --> 25:14.380]  That's a good example of one to toss, uh, to pass on, to get, uh, to let go.
[25:14.380 --> 25:19.140]  So I think, um, and then I think you did respond and say that it was lower branches.
[25:19.140 --> 25:24.500]  So that plant was just big enough and it was happy enough and it was ready to go into flower.
[25:24.500 --> 25:28.220]  When you did that, you just had a nice, happy, healthy plant with a lot of active hormones
[25:28.220 --> 25:29.220]  going on.
[25:29.220 --> 25:31.580]  And then when you cut that clone, you didn't do any damage to it.
[25:31.580 --> 25:35.940]  When you potted it and we put that micro on the rooting gel on there, you kept it completely
[25:35.940 --> 25:36.940]  happy.
[25:36.940 --> 25:40.460]  Uh, and it just went into flower for you because it was in the ideal conditions to go into
[25:40.460 --> 25:41.460]  flower.
[25:41.460 --> 25:44.380]  Uh, you did something right, man, because most of the time, if you cut a clone and do
[25:44.380 --> 25:49.000]  not put it in a dome within a few days like that, it will wither up and it will fall over
[25:49.000 --> 25:50.040]  and die.
[25:50.040 --> 25:51.460]  So maybe you're onto something.
[25:51.460 --> 25:52.580]  I hope you took good notes.
[25:52.580 --> 25:56.580]  I hope you remember exactly what you did so you can do it again and again and again, because
[25:56.740 --> 26:01.060]  will be a very effective way to learn how to call those boys from your garden.
[26:01.060 --> 26:04.300]  I feel like there's a little bit more to this podcast, so let's keep our, this, uh, not
[26:04.300 --> 26:05.300]  the podcast to this.
[26:05.300 --> 26:06.300]  Uh, what is it?
[26:06.300 --> 26:07.300]  This is a question.
[26:07.300 --> 26:08.300]  That's what this is.
[26:08.300 --> 26:13.700]  Um, let's keep reading so I can put my brain back on some sort of a track here.
[26:13.700 --> 26:17.980]  Uh, it says, oh, that plant was probably in panic mode because it got, so it flipped.
[26:17.980 --> 26:19.580]  That's was the, the bottom line there.
[26:19.580 --> 26:23.820]  And then it says, I love the show and I want you to know I will be joining Patri on soon.
[26:23.820 --> 26:24.820]  Uh, thank you, man.
[26:24.820 --> 26:27.420]  No stress on joining Patri on a no rush on that.
[26:27.420 --> 26:30.900]  It says, I definitely want to support everything you do financially.
[26:30.900 --> 26:35.100]  I will be ordering two packs of lemon sunrise and dragon punch this month and then next
[26:35.100 --> 26:37.900]  month I will join the army in full.
[26:37.900 --> 26:42.460]  I know 10 bucks a month will not break me, but I live my life financially like I do my
[26:42.460 --> 26:44.460]  grow very disciplined.
[26:44.460 --> 26:47.900]  Um, my friend, it is weird times right now.
[26:47.900 --> 26:50.860]  Uh, money is not guaranteed right now.
[26:50.860 --> 26:52.580]  Income is not promised.
[26:52.580 --> 26:53.820]  Tomorrow is not promised.
[26:53.820 --> 26:56.460]  Things can go very strangely in these times.
[26:56.460 --> 27:01.500]  So you stay disciplined, keep that wallet tight, keep the budget tight and conserve
[27:01.500 --> 27:02.660]  those funds.
[27:02.660 --> 27:03.860]  I'm doing okay right now.
[27:03.860 --> 27:06.660]  I had a good couple of months, so don't stress out.
[27:06.660 --> 27:08.580]  I'll get those seeds, get the garden going.
[27:08.580 --> 27:12.580]  If you need more help, you let me know and I'll look forward to the Patri on contributions,
[27:12.580 --> 27:16.900]  but don't feel like you've got to contribute to Patri on that is not required.
[27:16.900 --> 27:20.860]  You notice I'm still reading your message, still giving you a big salute and a fist bump.
[27:20.860 --> 27:23.260]  Uh, nothing but love and respect for you either way.
[27:23.300 --> 27:24.300]  I understand you guys.
[27:24.300 --> 27:28.340]  A lot of people had to actually canceled our Patri on support in the past couple of months
[27:28.340 --> 27:31.700]  because of the pandy and don't feel bad about it.
[27:31.700 --> 27:33.980]  I want you, uh, it's called grow from your heart.
[27:33.980 --> 27:34.980]  I want you to be happy.
[27:34.980 --> 27:35.980]  I want you to have what you need.
[27:35.980 --> 27:38.980]  I want you to feel love and feel safe and secure.
[27:38.980 --> 27:43.380]  And if 10 bucks is going to mess up your family, your life this month, don't give it to me.
[27:43.380 --> 27:44.380]  I will be okay.
[27:44.380 --> 27:47.980]  I'd rather you buy 10 more bucks worth of groceries, maybe 10 more bucks worth of weed,
[27:47.980 --> 27:49.980]  uh, maybe 10 more bucks for the kids.
[27:49.980 --> 27:52.820]  Maybe who knows what it's for, but if you need it, just use it, man.
[27:52.820 --> 27:54.140]  I'm not going to feel bad.
[27:54.140 --> 27:55.140]  I appreciate you.
[27:55.140 --> 27:56.140]  I love you.
[27:56.140 --> 27:57.140]  I respect you either way.
[27:57.140 --> 27:59.060]  I've got a seed company that will keep me going.
[27:59.060 --> 28:01.300]  Uh, if the Patri on doesn't do it, the seeds will do it.
[28:01.300 --> 28:02.900]  If the seeds don't do it, Patri on will do it.
[28:02.900 --> 28:05.700]  And if those don't fail, some consulting will cover it up.
[28:05.700 --> 28:07.180]  Job will provide, I will be okay.
[28:07.180 --> 28:11.020]  So thank you guys for the support, but don't ever feel like you've got to do it.
[28:11.020 --> 28:15.380]  Uh, especially my friend newbie nugs get the garden dialed in, live on that tight budget.
[28:15.380 --> 28:18.380]  I do understand it is COVID times.
[28:18.380 --> 28:20.420]  Things can go weird at any moment right now.
[28:20.420 --> 28:22.300]  Uh, so there's more to this.
[28:22.300 --> 28:27.780]  It says there is a time empty pots and a money envelope dedicated to you just has to
[28:27.780 --> 28:28.780]  run its course.
[28:28.780 --> 28:33.460]  So my friend's got some time, uh, empty pots so that he could put the seeds in and a money
[28:33.460 --> 28:36.180]  envelopes so he could start throwing some funding in so we could help out the Patri
[28:36.180 --> 28:38.340]  on just has to run its course.
[28:38.340 --> 28:40.660]  I understand that bro time has got to run its course.
[28:40.660 --> 28:44.220]  Hopefully after this pandy goes away, we'll get able to get back, able to play again,
[28:44.220 --> 28:48.780]  get able to make some money again, live life like we used to do it.
[28:48.780 --> 28:51.380]  He wraps up with, thanks for taking the time to read this.
[28:51.460 --> 28:55.260]  Hey my friend, thank you for taking the time to type this and to send it.
[28:55.260 --> 28:57.740]  If you ever have any more questions, you know how to find me.
[28:57.740 --> 29:05.620]  Of course this did come from the website, the grow help tab at IRI genetics.com.
[29:05.620 --> 29:09.740]  All right ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers,
[29:09.740 --> 29:12.980]  growers, clone cutters, Paul and shuckers, all you beautiful people out there.
[29:12.980 --> 29:17.860]  I want to thank each and every one of you for listening to episode 616 of the grow from
[29:17.860 --> 29:19.340]  your heart podcast.
[29:19.340 --> 29:22.020]  It blows my mind every time I say the episode numbers.
[29:22.020 --> 29:26.700]  You guys, have you ever done anything 616 times consistently?
[29:26.700 --> 29:27.940]  Wow.
[29:27.940 --> 29:30.300]  Thank you guys for following me, for joining me, for supporting me.
