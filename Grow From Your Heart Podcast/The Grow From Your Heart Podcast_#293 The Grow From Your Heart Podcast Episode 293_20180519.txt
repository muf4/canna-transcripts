[00:00.060 --> 00:03.060]  Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[00:43.240 --> 00:45.240]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:45.240 --> 00:49.240]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:49.240 --> 00:51.240]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:51.240 --> 00:56.240]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:57.240 --> 01:03.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, I just took a giant dab of some Skywalker batter, and it tastes amazing.
[01:03.240 --> 01:07.240]  I'm not sure who grew it, but it was extracted by my friend Spence at the Garden of Whedon.
[01:07.240 --> 01:11.240]  Dude, good job. I am nice and mellow, my eyes are nice and heavy.
[01:11.240 --> 01:13.240]  That's one thing I miss about smoking flowers.
[01:13.240 --> 01:18.240]  I notice when I smoke flowers, my eyes get that nice heavy eye-high, and I don't get that from concentrates as much.
[01:18.240 --> 01:23.240]  This Skywalker did it to me. It made my eyes nice and droopy, nice and heavy, gave me that old school high.
[01:23.240 --> 01:27.240]  I really enjoy it. Shout out to my buddy Spence. I miss you, bro. We gotta get together more frequently.
[01:27.240 --> 01:31.240]  Alright, so that's what I'm dabbing on. Also, I dabbed on some Dosey Dose sauce earlier.
[01:31.240 --> 01:37.240]  Ah, that stuff tastes tremendous. So I'm smoking the Skywalker batter and Dosey Dose sauce today.
[01:37.240 --> 01:40.240]  Thanks for joining me, everybody. Before we get too far, let's cover some business.
[01:40.240 --> 01:43.240]  This podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:43.240 --> 01:48.240]  That's right. If you're looking to add some new genetics to your garden, look no further than the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[01:48.240 --> 01:53.240]  You can find them at dankseed.store. Make sure you check them out and support them.
[01:53.240 --> 01:58.240]  Also, I owe a huge thank you to everybody who has sent me some birthday love.
[01:58.240 --> 02:03.240]  That's right, my birthday was on March 1st, and everybody that reached out to me, huge thank you.
[02:03.240 --> 02:09.240]  I appreciate all of the birthday love. My Facebook exploded, my Instagram, my Twitter, my text messages, my emails.
[02:09.240 --> 02:14.240]  Everybody was super sweet to me. My day was filled with hugs and high fives and birthday greetings.
[02:14.240 --> 02:18.240]  I got some cheesecake. I got some other things I shouldn't mention here on the podcast, but thank you.
[02:18.240 --> 02:25.240]  It was a great birthday. Since I'm throwing out thank yous, I want to say thank you to you guys that listened to the podcast on Stitcher.
[02:26.240 --> 02:32.240]  In the month of February, this podcast received over 100,000 downloads in the month of February.
[02:32.240 --> 02:38.240]  February is the shortest month of the year, and I broke a record in the month of February. Thank you.
[02:38.240 --> 02:40.240]  Also, thanks to everybody that listens on every other service.
[02:40.240 --> 02:47.240]  Unfortunately, iTunes and all the other services do not provide very good statistics or information or data to me.
[02:47.240 --> 02:53.240]  iTunes just kind of opened up some data, but it's not very thorough yet. It's their beta. Stitcher gives me a lot of info.
[02:53.240 --> 02:59.240]  Stitcher showed me that I had 100,000 downloads in the month of February, and that blows my mind.
[02:59.240 --> 03:05.240]  Thank you to everybody listening on Stitcher, and thank you to everybody listening on all the other services. I appreciate it.
[03:05.240 --> 03:11.240]  Also, I owe a huge thank you to everybody who contributed to Patreon in the past and in the month of February.
[03:11.240 --> 03:15.240]  Once again, in February, I broke another record. We broke another record. You broke another record.
[03:15.240 --> 03:20.240]  I put out the content. You guys contribute to Patreon. Thank you. You guys broke another record.
[03:20.240 --> 03:23.240]  Huge thank you to everybody who contributes.
[03:23.240 --> 03:28.240]  If you don't already know what I'm talking about, let me tell you guys about Patreon really quickly. I'm sure you've already heard about it.
[03:28.240 --> 03:36.240]  Patreon is a website. Patreon is a service that allows you as a listener to financially contribute to podcasts and other content creators.
[03:36.240 --> 03:40.240]  Go to Patreon. Type in maybe your favorite content creator. Maybe there's an artist on there.
[03:40.240 --> 03:48.240]  Maybe there's a musician on there that you want to support, but I have got a Patreon creator page where you can financially contribute to my efforts.
[03:48.240 --> 03:53.240]  What will happen is you'll go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart. You'll read all the information about the podcast.
[03:53.240 --> 04:00.240]  You'll read my promises to you. You'll read my goals. If you feel like contributing, you type in a dollar amount, and you can contribute to my show.
[04:00.240 --> 04:04.240]  What I will do with those funds, I'm going to use them to buy a new MacBook Pro.
[04:04.240 --> 04:08.240]  My computer is going slow enough to have me a little bit worried.
[04:08.240 --> 04:12.240]  I don't use it excessively anymore. I don't use it for things that it's not necessary.
[04:12.240 --> 04:16.680]  necessary. I've been trying just to use the computer just for recording purposes
[04:16.680 --> 04:20.720]  so it lasts as long as possible but that is my new goal. I'm going to replace the
[04:20.720 --> 04:24.700]  MacBook with the Patreon contributions. That may take quite a while but I'm
[04:24.700 --> 04:28.520]  going to do the best I can. I will also throw in my own funding but I'm trying
[04:28.520 --> 04:33.000]  to do it the most I can from Patreon. It just really helps me and makes my life
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.320]  easier. A new MacBook is quite pricey but that's what's gonna happen with the
[04:36.320 --> 04:39.800]  Patreon contributions. So anyone that contributes to Patreon, thank you for the
[04:39.800 --> 04:43.720]  help. You are keeping the podcast going. It keeps the website alive and it's
[04:43.720 --> 04:48.320]  going to keep the computer that records the show alive so I appreciate that. Now
[04:48.320 --> 04:52.240]  speaking of Patreon, one of my promises on Patreon is that if you contribute a
[04:52.240 --> 04:57.320]  specific amount that I will read your email on a future episode. Now I didn't
[04:57.320 --> 05:01.520]  have any sort of notification set up on my Patreon so a few people contributed
[05:01.520 --> 05:05.080]  and I never read their emails and I realized it and I got to their emails as
[05:05.080 --> 05:09.640]  soon as I could. I apologize for that. If you feel like you contributed to Patreon
[05:09.960 --> 05:14.240]  and I did not read your email that you expected read, just send me an email. It's
[05:14.240 --> 05:17.640]  growfromyourheart at hotmail.com. I'll say it again because I stutter in the
[05:17.640 --> 05:21.800]  middle. growfromyourheart at hotmail.com. Send me an email and say hey dude I
[05:21.800 --> 05:25.320]  contributed to Patreon expecting my email read. You never read it. What the
[05:25.320 --> 05:29.480]  fuck. Here's my email. Resend it and I'll get to you. I promise. I didn't have a way
[05:29.480 --> 05:32.880]  to know that people were contributing and expecting that level. I just wasn't I
[05:32.880 --> 05:36.640]  didn't have Patreon set up correctly to notify me so I missed a couple and I'm
[05:36.680 --> 05:40.000]  trying to be accountable and catch up and read those for you. So here is one of
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.320]  those that I did miss and this person was polite enough to reach out and say
[05:43.320 --> 05:48.200]  hey bro I contributed and you never read it so here's a repost of my email and it
[05:48.200 --> 05:53.640]  goes like this. Waghwan, Rasta Jeff, what's kicking man? This email is a bit
[05:53.640 --> 05:58.040]  overdue. I'm a Patreon supporter and a longtime listener of your show. Big up
[05:58.040 --> 06:01.880]  all you do for the community man. Babylon is plagued by ignorance and oppression.
[06:01.880 --> 06:05.680]  The wisdom and knowledge you spread is our best tool to fight and rise above
[06:05.680 --> 06:08.920]  the injustice and oppression surrounding this sacred herb. Keep
[06:08.920 --> 06:13.120]  educating people. Give thanks. Man that's a great intro to an email. Thank you. I
[06:13.120 --> 06:17.080]  think it's great that you say Babylon is plagued by ignorance and oppression and
[06:17.080 --> 06:21.080]  the wisdom and knowledge I spread is our best tool because a lot of what inspired
[06:21.080 --> 06:25.960]  me to do a podcast was reading forums and reading things on the internet that
[06:25.960 --> 06:29.800]  were absolutely incorrect. Things that were going to cause more problems for
[06:29.800 --> 06:32.920]  people's gardens and that made me say shit I need to step up and do something
[06:33.120 --> 06:37.040]  and I thought the best thing I could do would be write a book but then I realized
[06:37.040 --> 06:41.280]  that a book would be ever-changing because the episode I wrote about drying
[06:41.280 --> 06:44.440]  and curing two years ago I've learned so much since then that it would be a new
[06:44.440 --> 06:48.920]  book now and the old book would be obsolete and so I think podcasting is
[06:48.920 --> 06:52.600]  ever-evolving and I can put out new content as soon as I learn it so that's
[06:52.600 --> 06:58.200]  why I ended up podcasting so thank you. That ignorance and plague of Babylon and
[06:58.600 --> 07:04.600]  that oppression is part of what inspired this. I try to keep my Rastafari ideas
[07:04.600 --> 07:08.920]  and my Rasta talk and thoughts to myself because I don't think that's what people
[07:08.920 --> 07:13.640]  are listening to the podcast for but when you say the wisdom and knowledge I
[07:13.640 --> 07:17.440]  spread is our best tool to fight and rise above the injustice and oppression
[07:17.440 --> 07:23.000]  surrounding this sacred herb that really speaks to me as a Rasta man and that
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.520]  lets me know that I'm doing exactly what I need to be doing and that I am right
[07:26.520 --> 07:29.800]  where I need to be helping the people I need to be helping the way I need to be
[07:29.800 --> 07:33.600]  helping them so thank you that's a huge compliment and it meant more than you
[07:33.600 --> 07:37.560]  thought it would so I appreciate that. Then he says keep educating people give
[07:37.560 --> 07:42.320]  thanks. Yes I I love to educate and I will keep it up as long as I can you
[07:42.320 --> 07:45.920]  guys I keep promising more episodes I'm almost to 300 and I see no end in sight
[07:45.920 --> 07:49.280]  there's no reason to stop doing this as long as this microphone that computer
[07:49.280 --> 07:54.040]  and this throat work I will keep putting out podcasts. Alright the email keeps
[07:54.120 --> 07:58.000]  going you guys it goes like this up until recently I was a grower at a large
[07:58.000 --> 08:02.240]  state licensed medical production facility here on the East Coast as you
[08:02.240 --> 08:05.480]  know there's nothing like a good podcast to keep you flowing and vibing through a
[08:05.480 --> 08:09.160]  long day in the garden I would look forward to your podcast each Monday
[08:09.160 --> 08:13.200]  unfortunately the folks I worked for didn't exactly believe in growing from
[08:13.200 --> 08:17.840]  the heart and I chose to move on to find an operation with more like-minded
[08:17.840 --> 08:22.400]  values and put the patients and plants above profit. Hey uh much respect for
[08:22.400 --> 08:26.960]  doing that and that's a challenging thing to do in this industry finding
[08:26.960 --> 08:31.680]  owners and managers and investors that have the heart that the growers have is
[08:31.680 --> 08:37.640]  one of the largest challenges I've faced in this industry. We'll keep going with
[08:37.640 --> 08:41.800]  the email it goes like this your podcast inspired me and helped me and helped give
[08:41.800 --> 08:45.640]  me the strength and confidence to move on and follow my heart I can't thank you
[08:45.640 --> 08:49.920]  enough. Man your email is huge thanks so you're working at it thank you. Now I
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.080]  work at a boutique veganic caregiving operation that puts out quality medicine
[08:54.080 --> 08:58.720]  above all else. See it looks like you worked hard you found your way in you
[08:58.720 --> 09:03.040]  realized it wasn't what you wanted you got a good background and now you're
[09:03.040 --> 09:07.320]  where you want to be that's that deserves props right there so good start
[09:07.320 --> 09:10.840]  man good start. It's hard to leave somewhere when you've already got
[09:10.840 --> 09:15.760]  employment like it's harder to go look for employment it's easier to go to a
[09:15.760 --> 09:18.800]  job that sucks than it is to go look for a new job is what I think I'm trying to
[09:18.800 --> 09:22.040]  say so man that took some balls to get out of there and I'm dude I'm glad you're
[09:22.040 --> 09:25.520]  at a veganic caregiving operation that puts out quality medicine that's what
[09:25.520 --> 09:29.280]  matters I bet the patients there love your product and I bet you love the
[09:29.280 --> 09:32.520]  patients and now you like your job better and so you're gonna put out a
[09:32.520 --> 09:36.640]  better product in turn. Alright the email keeps going it says I apologize for the
[09:36.640 --> 09:41.200]  long email but I figured I should sneak in a grow question while I'm at it. Hey
[09:41.200 --> 09:45.020]  dude no need to apologize for a long email I get quite long-winded I guess
[09:45.020 --> 09:49.260]  it's okay that you do also the email continues it goes like this I really
[09:49.260 --> 09:53.220]  enjoyed your recent episode on fire safety and you guys this email was kind
[09:53.220 --> 09:57.500]  of a long way back I just didn't find it and so there was an email or an episode
[09:57.500 --> 10:00.060]  about fire safety that did happen you may have to go search through the feed
[10:00.060 --> 10:03.460]  but it's there he says it got me thinking about something else pertaining
[10:03.460 --> 10:07.840]  to safety that's often overlooked would you mind sharing any knowledge you have
[10:07.840 --> 10:11.660]  in regards to eye protection in the grow room when I worked for the dispensary
[10:11.660 --> 10:15.260]  they provided special HPS safety glasses made by Phillips like the bulb
[10:15.260 --> 10:19.460]  company at my new garden I was surprised to see everyone just rocked standard
[10:19.460 --> 10:23.260]  polarized sunglasses I'm sensitive to bright light and prefer not to fuck
[10:23.260 --> 10:27.580]  around with my eyes so I dropped some dough on a pair of Method 7s what do you
[10:27.580 --> 10:30.820]  like to rock for eye protection when you're at three rivers under that sea of
[10:30.820 --> 10:35.060]  Govitas the research I've done suggests that working under HPS lights
[10:35.060 --> 10:39.700]  unprotected for extended periods of time long term may cause some scary effects
[10:39.700 --> 10:45.180]  on eye and skin health also do you wear long sleeves I recently started to as an
[10:45.180 --> 10:49.340]  effort to cut down on the allergic reactions on my arms from being elbow
[10:49.340 --> 10:54.140]  deep and trichomes all day and I figure it also helps minimize my skin's daily UV
[10:54.140 --> 10:59.860]  exposure any insight would be much appreciated thanks dude also I wanted to
[10:59.860 --> 11:02.900]  let you know I've been jamming some Gregory Isaac and dabbing on some key
[11:02.900 --> 11:08.460]  lime pie live sauce rolled in some CBD isolate dude you're going in again
[11:08.460 --> 11:12.460]  apologies for the long-winded email much love from main Rasta and then he
[11:12.460 --> 11:16.060]  says his name and he says please don't say my name if you're reading on the
[11:16.060 --> 11:19.460]  podcast so I won't say your name dude and I will listen back and make sure I
[11:19.460 --> 11:24.020]  didn't say your name at all in the episode as I was reading this I'm
[11:24.020 --> 11:25.860]  looking you didn't say your name anywhere else so I didn't have the
[11:25.860 --> 11:31.060]  opportunity all right I didn't say your name more cool um dude thanks for the
[11:31.060 --> 11:35.940]  great email this is awesome you're right also let's talk about Gregory Isaacs and
[11:35.940 --> 11:39.900]  key lime pie live sauce that's got to be a perfect day just chilling some nice
[11:39.900 --> 11:44.220]  smooth old-school reggae and some nice live sauce rolled in CBD you're gonna be
[11:44.220 --> 11:48.100]  mellow and just chilling out it's gonna be a good day kind of makes me want to
[11:48.100 --> 11:50.740]  take a dab to tell you the truth all right that's what's gonna happen you
[11:50.740 --> 11:53.500]  guys I'm gonna press pause I'm gonna take a dab I'm gonna get some fresh
[11:53.500 --> 11:57.820]  water and when we get back we're gonna talk about eye protection in the garden
[11:57.820 --> 12:01.380]  hey everyone it's three tokes and you're tuned in to the growth from your heart
[12:02.380 --> 12:07.900]  podcast all right podcast world I am back and I am heavily medicated this
[12:07.900 --> 12:13.580]  Skywalker batter is a little heavier than I remembered I probably should have
[12:13.580 --> 12:21.300]  only take one dab but I think three was okay I'm giving it a smell and the only
[12:21.300 --> 12:24.660]  way I can describe it is it smells like Skywalker you guys it's got like a
[12:24.660 --> 12:27.940]  coffee sort of smell and I always say coffee I think a lot of the og smell
[12:27.940 --> 12:31.260]  they have a hint of coffee like if coffee was across the if coffee is being
[12:31.260 --> 12:34.520]  roasted in the room next door that's kind of what it smells like roasted
[12:34.520 --> 12:40.540]  coffee with a little bit of earth maybe in a hint of mud and I know that doesn't
[12:40.540 --> 12:44.620]  sound appetizing but it's that earthy humus smell that I really love so it's
[12:44.620 --> 12:50.860]  like a earthy coffee and then maybe a vanilla top maybe a very light flavor of
[12:50.860 --> 12:56.100]  vanilla on the top I love it took a couple fat dabs got nicely medicated
[12:56.460 --> 13:00.540]  let's talk about the appearance here a little bit it looks like somebody melted
[13:00.540 --> 13:04.700]  a piece of golden butter in this glass container the middle has a nice chunk
[13:04.700 --> 13:08.860]  it's kind of like dark butter like if the butter sat out and got kind of dark
[13:08.860 --> 13:13.980]  it is that color and then around it it's got a puddle and that puddle is mostly
[13:13.980 --> 13:18.060]  turps that's just where the terpenes have leaked out and dissolved outside of
[13:18.060 --> 13:21.580]  the the batter and the batter is sitting right there in the middle as I tip the
[13:21.580 --> 13:24.420]  container a little bit I could see that puddle of turps run to the edge a little
[13:24.540 --> 13:27.900]  bit so when I get myself a dab I go in the middle and get some of the battery
[13:27.900 --> 13:30.780]  part and then I rub it around the edge and get some of the turps on there and
[13:30.780 --> 13:34.380]  then I get the full flavor I get everything I want out of it this is some
[13:34.380 --> 13:38.980]  some pretty good Skywalker batter I'm glad I was able to get that I wonder if
[13:38.980 --> 13:41.860]  there is any more shout out to our friends at the Garden of Weeden great
[13:41.860 --> 13:45.500]  work all right you guys I'm well medicated let's get back into this email
[13:45.500 --> 13:49.740]  this email was all about eye protection and they're not asking mainly about eye
[13:49.740 --> 13:53.460]  protection like eye safety wearing eye goggles from getting poked and while
[13:53.500 --> 13:57.500]  mixing things they're asking more about eye protection underneath all of the
[13:57.500 --> 14:01.740]  grow lights we spend a lot of time in grow rooms the grow rooms have thousand
[14:01.740 --> 14:05.500]  watt high-pressure sodium lights or thousand watt metal halide lights and
[14:05.500 --> 14:09.580]  we're in them all day and this guy brought up a very good point so the
[14:09.580 --> 14:14.740]  first thing I wanted to say is that your eyes are the most sensitive organ in
[14:14.740 --> 14:19.500]  your body that are exposed to the elements all day long your eyes are
[14:19.500 --> 14:21.940]  really sensitive that's the most sensitive thing on the outside of your
[14:21.980 --> 14:27.220]  body and it's also one of the things you use the most I feel like I could
[14:27.220 --> 14:32.420]  survive without my other senses I could get by in the life safely and not feel
[14:32.420 --> 14:37.220]  completely in danger and crippled all the time but without my vision I don't
[14:37.220 --> 14:42.340]  know that I could survive I wouldn't want to think about that too much that
[14:42.340 --> 14:45.780]  would be the one sense that would make me the most vulnerable if it were taken
[14:45.780 --> 14:50.300]  from me is my vision that's what I think so protect your eyes at all costs you
[14:50.300 --> 14:54.180]  guys not only under the lights but when you're mixing when you grab a bottle of
[14:54.180 --> 14:56.980]  nutrients and you're thinking about mixing it put on goggles before you
[14:56.980 --> 14:59.900]  grab it gloves and goggles they should be sitting next to each other at your
[14:59.900 --> 15:03.500]  workstation gloves and goggles before you pick up the bottle because when you
[15:03.500 --> 15:07.700]  pick up that bottle of pesticides or nutrients and you go to shake it maybe
[15:07.700 --> 15:10.660]  the guy that used it before you was in a hurry and he didn't put the lid on all
[15:10.660 --> 15:14.020]  the way you pick up that bottle you give it a little shake those pesticides or
[15:14.020 --> 15:17.460]  those nutrients or whatever it is could come flying up right out of that bottle
[15:17.460 --> 15:21.300]  into your eye you weren't doing anything but just gonna mix it up and
[15:21.300 --> 15:23.660]  you haven't even started applying it yet and you already got to go to the eye
[15:23.660 --> 15:28.380]  doctor so eye protection is super important if you're gonna spray
[15:28.380 --> 15:34.140]  something eye protection so this email addresses more protection from the
[15:34.140 --> 15:38.740]  lights wear some sort of protective glasses he asked what type of glasses do
[15:38.740 --> 15:44.420]  I wear when I'm under the sea of Govita's at Three Rivers I have got two
[15:44.620 --> 15:49.300]  pair of Method 7 glasses Three Rivers was kind enough to gift me a pair when I
[15:49.300 --> 15:52.820]  started there and then I bought my own pair so that I've got a backup pair
[15:52.820 --> 15:55.780]  because I kept leaving I've got multiple gardens and I would just leave them
[15:55.780 --> 16:01.380]  places so I've got two pair for when I forget one I've got one pair that they're
[16:01.380 --> 16:05.280]  not as heavy but I've got another pair that's too heavy I like them and they
[16:05.280 --> 16:08.100]  protect me well from the lights and I like that I can see the plants
[16:08.100 --> 16:13.060]  differently you guys I've got a pair of Oakley five squared
[16:13.060 --> 16:17.180]  with polarized lenses that I wear if I'm just walking into the groves to go
[16:17.180 --> 16:20.140]  do something those are my normal daily sunglasses I'll just throw those on to
[16:20.140 --> 16:23.500]  walk in there if I'm gonna go in there and do some work I'll put on my Method
[16:23.500 --> 16:27.980]  7s I can tell a difference in the way the plants look I can see more of the
[16:27.980 --> 16:32.340]  plant with my Method 7s it's more clear the colors are correct I can identify
[16:32.340 --> 16:36.960]  things better just the colors are more clear on each plant I can tell the
[16:36.960 --> 16:41.980]  difference between the black cherry the platinum tangy and the critical mass by
[16:41.980 --> 16:44.820]  the colors a little bit better the color stand out I just like seeing that
[16:44.820 --> 16:48.220]  I can identify if there's a problem or if something's coming up I can see it
[16:48.220 --> 16:52.140]  better with the Method 7s also I can tell they're protecting my eyes better
[16:52.140 --> 16:56.580]  the man I've got one pair of Method 7s that was bought for me by the company
[16:56.580 --> 17:01.060]  and they've got they say Method 7 and then they say HPS with a plus on the
[17:01.060 --> 17:04.580]  little bottom of the lens that plus means they've got an extra coating that
[17:04.580 --> 17:09.500]  is designed for rooms with more than 10 lights so I've got the super protective
[17:09.500 --> 17:13.300]  Method 7 glasses and I can tell the difference when I do use them and when
[17:13.300 --> 17:17.180]  I don't because honestly sometimes I'm lazy and I'm irresponsible and I don't
[17:17.180 --> 17:21.940]  use my Method 7 glasses and when I'm driving home and it's dark that's when I
[17:21.940 --> 17:25.660]  notice that I fucked up and didn't wear my glasses it doesn't bug me during the
[17:25.660 --> 17:28.660]  day when I'm working but when I get in the car and it's dark and my eyes have
[17:28.660 --> 17:33.260]  to try to adjust the headlights coming toward me they shine in the wrong
[17:33.260 --> 17:36.940]  directions and do weird things and it's just because I stressed my eyes under
[17:36.940 --> 17:41.700]  those grow lights all day so I wear the Method 7s when I'm thinking about it if
[17:41.700 --> 17:45.620]  I'm in a big grow I like the Method 7 glasses that say HPS plus on them
[17:45.620 --> 17:50.580]  because those are designed for larger rooms for brighter rooms I prefer them
[17:50.580 --> 17:54.580]  because I can feel a difference in protection in my eyes I like them because
[17:54.580 --> 17:58.120]  I can feel the difference after work I like them because I can see the
[17:58.120 --> 18:03.780]  difference in the plants and I like them just because I feel like I can see the
[18:03.780 --> 18:08.020]  room and the plants better overall and nobody pays me to say this you guys
[18:08.020 --> 18:12.180]  they're not I'm not sponsored by them I paid cash for one pair and I was gifted
[18:12.180 --> 18:17.140]  another pair by my company so I Method 7 does not pay me this is just advice that
[18:17.140 --> 18:21.140]  was brought up by somebody who cares about your eyes as much as I do so the
[18:21.140 --> 18:25.540]  Method 7s work well polarized glasses are not enough whether
[18:25.540 --> 18:28.980]  they are expensive Oakley's whether they're your Ray-Bans if they're the
[18:28.980 --> 18:32.100]  cheap ones from the mall where you can get six pair for fucking 22 bucks
[18:32.100 --> 18:36.140]  regular polarized glasses aren't enough I don't know the science behind it I did
[18:36.140 --> 18:41.380]  not do the research I can tell by my eyes I can tell when I don't wear my
[18:41.380 --> 18:46.020]  Method 7s the next night when I'm that night when I'm driving home my eyes are
[18:46.020 --> 18:49.340]  fucked up when I wear the Method 7s I can see better and I don't have as much
[18:49.340 --> 18:53.380]  of a struggle and I think it affects my sleep as well I don't have any science
[18:53.380 --> 18:56.780]  behind that but I feel like when I close my eyes at night and I've stressed my
[18:56.780 --> 19:00.100]  eyes my eyes feel differently and I sleep better when my eyes weren't
[19:00.100 --> 19:03.420]  stressed all day there's no science behind that either that's just my body
[19:03.420 --> 19:07.340]  and what I think I've observed myself so protect your eyes you guys you only get
[19:07.340 --> 19:13.540]  one set of eyes if you think about it the treatment for eye damage is fucking
[19:13.540 --> 19:20.820]  horrible my gramps had to get shots in his eyeballs and I could not imagine
[19:20.820 --> 19:25.540]  that shit I am cringing right now my toes are all fucking tight my stomach's
[19:25.540 --> 19:29.660]  all clenched my butthole is all tight I can't even imagine taking that he's got
[19:29.660 --> 19:32.940]  to lay his head back all relaxed on this table on this chair thing and they
[19:32.940 --> 19:35.660]  hold his eyeball open with this thing and they tell him look as far to the
[19:35.660 --> 19:38.540]  side as you can and he looks way over then they stick a needle in his eye dude
[19:38.540 --> 19:43.420]  and they put medicine in his eyeball fuck that you guys take care of your
[19:43.420 --> 19:47.380]  eyes all right take care of your eyes please this guy is bringing up such a
[19:47.380 --> 19:51.540]  good point so a couple hundred dollars in sunglasses will make your eyes and
[19:51.540 --> 19:54.380]  you won't have to get injections in your eyes my gramps is gone now so it doesn't
[19:54.380 --> 19:59.020]  have to do that anymore but holy shit I could couldn't imagine that that dude
[19:59.020 --> 20:03.780]  was a fucking tougher man than me by a long shot love you grandpa anyway let's
[20:03.780 --> 20:07.380]  keep going with his email answers this guy also says the research I've done
[20:07.380 --> 20:10.860]  suggests working under HBS lights unprotected for extended periods of time
[20:10.860 --> 20:16.940]  can cause some scary effects on the eye and the skin yes absolutely we are not
[20:16.940 --> 20:19.940]  supposed to be under those kinds of lights all day so it's definitely
[20:19.940 --> 20:23.340]  causing some sort of eye problem cover your eyes in there we've talked about
[20:23.340 --> 20:27.300]  that the skin you should wear long sleeves you should have long sleeves on
[20:27.300 --> 20:31.420]  all the time in the grow the email also says do you wear long sleeves I recently
[20:31.420 --> 20:36.220]  started to as an effort to cut down on allergic reactions yes you should be
[20:36.220 --> 20:39.740]  wearing songs long sleeves not only because of the lights not only because
[20:39.740 --> 20:42.820]  of the allergic reactions to the trichomes like you're saying but because
[20:42.820 --> 20:46.220]  there are pesticides in there and you're just rubbing around on things all day
[20:46.220 --> 20:51.020]  that are gonna irritate your skin and just imagine you're not spraying the
[20:51.020 --> 20:53.620]  pesticides on yourself but you're spraying them on the plants and then
[20:53.620 --> 20:57.140]  you're rubbing up on those leaves all day every day you're absorbing a little
[20:57.140 --> 21:00.900]  bit and a little bit and a little bit and over a long time that little bit
[21:00.900 --> 21:05.780]  could add up and cause a problem so yes where I protection where long sleeves
[21:05.780 --> 21:09.940]  wear gloves all the time when I walk to the back of the grow where the work part
[21:09.940 --> 21:14.860]  happens that's gloves go on even if I'm walking through with upper management
[21:14.860 --> 21:18.900]  even if I'm walking through just to do supervisory tasks to go find the crew
[21:18.900 --> 21:22.500]  and let them know what the next tasks are to go tell them hey guys 30 minutes
[21:22.500 --> 21:25.420]  to lunch you might want to start wrapping up this part I'll put on gloves
[21:25.420 --> 21:28.780]  then just in case I decide to grab something back there I don't want to
[21:28.780 --> 21:32.540]  touch anything in the grow area without gloves because I treat the entire grow
[21:32.540 --> 21:37.260]  as a pesticide contaminated area we've applied pesticides to every plant in
[21:37.260 --> 21:40.700]  every room then we've walked through there with our clothes and shoes and now
[21:40.700 --> 21:44.500]  we've dragged all those pesticides everywhere it's everywhere so I put on
[21:44.500 --> 21:50.300]  gloves I wear long sleeves I had an incident where I was mixing a 250 gallon
[21:50.300 --> 21:54.300]  reservoir with nutrients and I spilled nutrients on the edge of the reservoir
[21:54.300 --> 21:56.900]  because that shit happens you just drop a couple of drops you don't think about
[21:56.900 --> 22:00.980]  it and then you get a rag later and you clean it right I didn't clean the rag
[22:00.980 --> 22:04.900]  before I leaned on it to put my pH pen in there to see what the pH was I just
[22:04.900 --> 22:10.500]  rested my arm on there and stuck the pH pen in it and I saw pH is right okay
[22:10.500 --> 22:14.300]  let's get off the ladder let's go get the rag to clean it up go wiped it up go
[22:14.300 --> 22:17.460]  cleaned up the tank I said go wiped it up but whatever I'm trying to tell you
[22:17.460 --> 22:20.860]  what happened I went wiped it up I put the lid on the tank I press go on the
[22:20.860 --> 22:24.340]  pump I kept working and a few minutes later I was like oh shit my arm is on
[22:24.340 --> 22:27.300]  fire I had fulvic acid on my arm and it was
[22:27.300 --> 22:30.580]  fucking burning and I had picked it up from resting my arm on the top of the
[22:30.580 --> 22:34.340]  tank I know that because I just wiped fulvic I just put fulvic in the tank and
[22:34.340 --> 22:36.940]  I just wiped it off the top where I spilled it and I'm pretty sure I just
[22:36.940 --> 22:40.140]  stuck my arm in there while I was adjusting the pH I just measured the pH
[22:40.140 --> 22:43.140]  with the pH pen I used my right hand I leaned on the tank it would make perfect
[22:43.140 --> 22:46.900]  sense I picked up fulvic acid on my arm and burned myself now if I had long
[22:46.900 --> 22:50.060]  sleeves that probably wouldn't have happened also if I had long sleeves
[22:50.060 --> 22:53.740]  maybe I would absorbed more of it and burn more of my arm I'm not sure but
[22:53.740 --> 22:57.740]  long sleeves is always a good idea in the grow also have a set of backup
[22:57.740 --> 23:01.140]  clothes in the grow in case you do some shit like I did and you are wearing long
[23:01.140 --> 23:04.060]  sleeves and you stick your arm in the fulvic acid then you can just go take
[23:04.060 --> 23:07.260]  off the long sleeve shirt clean your arm up put on a freshie shirt you'll be okay
[23:07.260 --> 23:11.060]  you should always have a backup change of clothes in your grow all the way down
[23:11.060 --> 23:15.020]  that you should have a pair of shoes a pair of socks whatever kind of style
[23:15.020 --> 23:17.980]  underwear you prefer I'm not getting picky on you there if you're gonna wear
[23:17.980 --> 23:20.860]  a cup do that I'm just kidding about wearing a cup but some of you guys need
[23:20.860 --> 23:24.700]  a cup in your grow whatever kind of pants are gonna wear a fresh shirt if
[23:24.700 --> 23:28.980]  you're a lady whatever kind of bra you wear whatever kind of sports bra have a
[23:28.980 --> 23:32.540]  whole fresh set of clothes I've got long-ass dreadlocks I've got an extra
[23:32.540 --> 23:37.140]  dreadlock hat and a whole extra set of dreadlock whatever I've got I got a
[23:37.140 --> 23:40.500]  fucking hair tie and a hat and a wrap like I could tie my hair up in six
[23:40.500 --> 23:43.420]  different fashions if I needed to for different situations it's all in the car
[23:43.420 --> 23:47.460]  but just have fresh stuff because if you spill something on yourself at work you
[23:47.460 --> 23:51.420]  may need to get out of those clothes quickly you don't want whatever pesticide
[23:51.420 --> 23:54.180]  you're you any pesticide I don't want any pesticide on me even if it's
[23:54.180 --> 23:57.540]  something totally organic I don't need that shit on me for any longer than it
[23:57.540 --> 24:00.540]  needs to be there I need to change clothes need to get that cleaned off of
[24:00.540 --> 24:04.820]  me like quickly I don't like that kind of stuff so yeah wear long sleeves you
[24:04.820 --> 24:09.740]  guys the pesticides are bad the lights are bad I've been in grows I've been
[24:09.740 --> 24:13.020]  working in grows for a long time and I've been in the same grow at three
[24:13.020 --> 24:16.940]  rivers I've been in this grow at three rivers for I'm counting time in my head
[24:16.940 --> 24:21.180]  and trying to go quickly while I do it I've been there for 13 or 14 months and
[24:21.180 --> 24:27.060]  I have seen what a high-pressure sodium light can do to a hydro table we've had
[24:27.060 --> 24:30.940]  the same there's one table the mother plants have been on the same area on the
[24:30.940 --> 24:35.700]  same hydro table tub like a botanic hair 8x4 table and it's been there since I
[24:35.700 --> 24:39.860]  started and the light is fucking eating this table you guys it's changed it
[24:39.860 --> 24:43.500]  colors it's a totally different color and it's starting to kind of break down
[24:43.500 --> 24:47.300]  and deteriorate and it's not from the nutrients because it's up on the top the
[24:47.300 --> 24:50.340]  nutrients go in the bottom of this table they go they may be touching there but
[24:50.340 --> 24:54.500]  I'm certain it's the light fucking destroying this table also the tops of
[24:54.500 --> 24:57.740]  the fans they're not the right color anymore those white fans they're all
[24:57.740 --> 25:00.860]  like this orangey it looks like cigarette smoke but it's just the light
[25:00.860 --> 25:07.170]  breaking it down those grow lights are serious we're not supposed to be that
[25:07.170 --> 25:10.410]  close to that much light all day we were mimicking the Sun for the plants and
[25:10.410 --> 25:13.810]  it's working and we're using electricity and chemicals to do it and then we're
[25:13.810 --> 25:17.530]  dancing around under it all day and not covering our skin that's something we
[25:17.530 --> 25:21.610]  should think about don't get yourself any sort of weird skin cancers for your
[25:21.610 --> 25:25.130]  grow they're not gonna pay you enough for that it's not worth it you're trying
[25:25.130 --> 25:29.850]  to so now you're gonna have to smoke more weed to not get cancer from the
[25:29.850 --> 25:32.610]  cancer that you're getting from the lights that you're using to grow the
[25:32.610 --> 25:37.270]  weed that you're smoking to not get cancer right that's just gonna be a
[25:37.270 --> 25:40.570]  terrible cycle let's not do that let's cover ourselves up you guys this email
[25:40.570 --> 25:43.730]  is great I do try to wear long sleeves however it gets hot as fuck in the grow
[25:43.730 --> 25:48.210]  sometimes and I catch myself running around in a t-shirt you guys this guy's
[25:48.210 --> 25:50.890]  got the right idea he said I recently started as an effort to cut down on
[25:50.890 --> 25:54.690]  allergic reactions to my arms being elbow deep and trichomes all day and I
[25:54.690 --> 25:59.330]  also figure it helps minimize my skin's daily UV exposure then he said any
[25:59.330 --> 26:02.650]  insight would be much appreciated I think I gave you a lot of insight I feel
[26:02.650 --> 26:06.650]  like I rambled on a lot about it cover your eyes cover your arms also wear a
[26:06.650 --> 26:10.970]  hat the top of your head is exposed to those lights all day I'm six foot five
[26:10.970 --> 26:15.210]  you guys I can feel those grow lights on my head I think it's funny I've got
[26:15.210 --> 26:19.490]  I'm six foot five and I've got dreadlocks to my knees that's not a joke
[26:19.490 --> 26:23.690]  that's not an exaggeration some of my dreadlocks are as big around I'm looking
[26:23.690 --> 26:29.490]  for something a similar size as the diameter of my dreadlocks they are as
[26:29.490 --> 26:34.290]  big around as my torch that's not even a joke I'm using a blazer torch and a
[26:34.290 --> 26:38.730]  couple of my dreadlocks are the diameter of this torch that's not an exaggeration
[26:38.730 --> 26:41.610]  it's not a joke there's a lot of fucking hair on my head I'll wrap my
[26:41.610 --> 26:44.930]  hair up in my head and put it on top of my head and put a hat on and I'll hear
[26:44.930 --> 26:51.650]  other people say it's hot in this grow and I laugh I'm touching the goddamn
[26:51.650 --> 26:55.290]  light with my head bro you think you're hot come over here get up on this ladder
[26:55.290 --> 26:59.490]  and hang out up at my level it's hot bro so sometimes I catch myself with it with
[26:59.490 --> 27:02.690]  just a t-shirt on I catch myself without the proper headgear without the proper
[27:02.690 --> 27:07.610]  glasses and I noticed that I'm gonna pay for it as I'm getting older and you know
[27:07.610 --> 27:11.490]  what since I'm talking let's give one more good piece of advice those grow
[27:11.490 --> 27:15.210]  lights are sucking all of the moisture out of your body drink more water when
[27:15.210 --> 27:18.410]  you're working in the grow hydrate take care of yourself you're working hard
[27:18.410 --> 27:23.650]  you're probably wearing long sleeves and a hat and gloves and shoes and long
[27:23.650 --> 27:26.850]  pants and you're working hard and sweating your ass off and those lights
[27:26.850 --> 27:30.210]  are just cooking you drink more water take good care of yourself you guys
[27:30.210 --> 27:34.330]  alright that's enough talk from old man grandpa Jeff trying to get you youngsters
[27:34.330 --> 27:37.330]  take care of yourself let's do a few shoutouts I always shout out to my
[27:37.330 --> 27:42.170]  friend Zach M also to Andrew and Todd K thanks for all the support on the

[27:50.370 --> 27:54.530]  all cannabis ambassadors we are all representing this cannabis plant in our
[27:54.530 --> 28:00.250]  own way if you are like I said earlier a grower a smoker an activist or if you're
[28:00.250 --> 28:04.290]  just curious about it if you are here you are representing cannabis in some
[28:04.290 --> 28:08.570]  sort of way please let's all work together to do it in a positive way
[28:08.570 --> 28:12.170]  let's all work together let's stop working against each other in the
[28:12.170 --> 28:16.730]  cannabis world we need to join forces we need to be positive we need to represent
[28:16.730 --> 28:20.730]  cannabis in a positive light everywhere we go if we're going to represent
[28:20.730 --> 28:25.490]  cannabis if that is your fight stick with it don't embarrass cannabis don't
[28:25.490 --> 28:30.050]  embarrass the rest of us do it responsibly do it like an adult do it
[28:30.050 --> 28:34.570]  carefully do it at the right place and do it positively and let's all stick
[28:34.570 --> 28:38.810]  together you guys and also keep in mind that there is a time and place for
[28:38.810 --> 28:43.370]  cannabis and cannabis activism and cannabis speaking it's not always the
[28:43.370 --> 28:47.730]  time and it's not always the place don't go push your cannabis talk in the wrong
[28:47.730 --> 28:52.130]  platform and embarrass yourself don't go smelling like cannabis at the wrong
[28:52.130 --> 28:55.890]  place and look like an asshole have a little bit of respect for places that
[28:55.890 --> 29:00.050]  don't want you smelling like cannabis there don't smoke cannabis in places
[29:00.050 --> 29:04.330]  that would offend people yes we are part of a revolution we are trying to do our
[29:04.330 --> 29:08.530]  thing but we also need to keep in mind that the dumb shit we do is what holds
[29:08.530 --> 29:12.030]  us back from getting this plant legalized and accepted when you
[29:12.030 --> 29:16.730]  embarrass us and you make us look stupid it puts us ten steps backwards so please
