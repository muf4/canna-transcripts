[00:17.610 --> 00:18.610]  Heart podcast.

[00:52.350 --> 00:53.350]  Thank you.
[00:53.350 --> 00:55.310]  Shout out to our friend Tartan Mike.

[01:10.050 --> 01:12.290]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen.
[01:12.290 --> 01:16.170]  And of course, there is a link in the show notes and the video description to make it
[01:16.170 --> 01:19.870]  nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:19.870 --> 01:21.210]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[01:21.210 --> 01:25.970]  Let's start off with a couple of internet questions I have received from YouTube and
[01:25.970 --> 01:27.930]  from a couple of emails real quick here.
[01:27.930 --> 01:30.890]  People have been asking why I don't smoke on the show.
[01:30.890 --> 01:31.890]  That is a very good question.
[01:31.890 --> 01:33.970]  It is a cannabis based show.
[01:33.970 --> 01:35.890]  I talk about smoking a lot.
[01:35.890 --> 01:39.470]  A lot of times I tell you what I just smoked, but why don't I smoke on the show?
[01:39.470 --> 01:41.310]  That's a very good question.
[01:41.310 --> 01:44.490]  First of all, I smoked plenty right before the show.
[01:44.490 --> 01:46.010]  I take a couple of fat dabs.
[01:46.010 --> 01:47.010]  I set up these lights.
[01:47.010 --> 01:48.010]  I set up the camera.
[01:48.010 --> 01:51.550]  Then I take a couple of more dabs and make sure everything's all rocking and rolling.
[01:51.550 --> 01:53.410]  Do a quick little mic check.
[01:53.410 --> 01:55.850]  Then I start recording once I get my voice recovered.
[01:55.850 --> 01:58.290]  I get plenty dabbed out before I start the show.
[01:58.290 --> 02:01.250]  There's no need to stop talking and take a couple of dabs.
[02:01.250 --> 02:03.130]  That gets me to my second reason.
[02:03.130 --> 02:05.370]  There's no reason to stop talking and take dabs.
[02:05.370 --> 02:06.370]  I'm plenty lit.
[02:06.370 --> 02:09.610]  I'm here to teach you guys and give you a quality podcast.
[02:09.610 --> 02:14.450]  If I stop and take a dab or smoke a bowl in the middle, that would probably take away
[02:14.450 --> 02:15.690]  from the quality of the show.
[02:15.690 --> 02:18.410]  It would definitely derail my focus.
[02:18.410 --> 02:20.130]  I just try to stay focused and keep smoking.
[02:20.130 --> 02:23.930]  You notice when I do have a guest, when Mike is on or somebody else is here, when they're
[02:23.930 --> 02:25.290]  talking, I do puff a little bit.
[02:25.290 --> 02:28.090]  My intention for that is to keep my hands busy.
[02:28.090 --> 02:30.890]  I got ADD and I don't know what to do with my hands.
[02:30.890 --> 02:33.650]  I'm just keeping my hands moving when other people are here on the show.
[02:33.650 --> 02:36.570]  Also, it helps me to stay calm and not interrupt so much.
[02:36.570 --> 02:42.130]  If I'm smoking, a lot of times my ADD tells me to chime in and say something that's unnecessary.
[02:42.130 --> 02:45.010]  I found that if I let a guest talk, they'll tell me what I want to know.
[02:45.010 --> 02:46.570]  I don't really need to interrupt.
[02:46.570 --> 02:48.530]  I smoke while they're talking.
[02:48.530 --> 02:50.290]  That's when I do smoke.
[02:50.290 --> 02:56.090]  The main reason I don't smoke though, honestly, is because YouTube sometimes will flag a video
[02:56.090 --> 02:57.090]  with consumption.
[02:57.090 --> 03:01.730]  I am more likely to get my videos taken down, my videos flagged, something disrupted by
[03:01.730 --> 03:04.890]  YouTube because of consumption in the video.
[03:04.890 --> 03:09.370]  I'm doing my best to keep these videos up on YouTube, keep the channel clean.
[03:09.370 --> 03:13.750]  That is my main reason, honestly, for not mass consumption here on the channel.
[03:13.750 --> 03:17.450]  You never know, we may have a multiple person show here in the future where we just bust
[03:17.450 --> 03:18.450]  out and smoke a lot.
[03:18.450 --> 03:23.850]  For the most part, I don't smoke because dabbing and smoking gives me the, that in
[03:23.850 --> 03:26.250]  my throat and nobody wants that shit in a podcast.
[03:26.250 --> 03:27.770]  Also, I'm here to teach you.
[03:27.770 --> 03:28.810]  I'm here to stay focused.
[03:28.810 --> 03:30.490]  I'm here to just keep talking.
[03:30.490 --> 03:31.490]  You don't want to watch me.
[03:31.490 --> 03:34.090]  Maybe you do want to watch me smoke, but that'll be my next point.
[03:34.090 --> 03:38.170]  I'm trying to give you a quality podcast without getting the channel deleted is my main reason
[03:38.170 --> 03:40.490]  why I don't smoke on the show.
[03:40.490 --> 03:45.610]  The next point, if you do want to hang out and watch me smoke, join me on Instagram live.
[03:45.610 --> 03:46.610]  That's right.
[03:46.610 --> 03:49.010]  Monday at 7 10 PM mountain time.
[03:49.010 --> 03:50.530]  I'm here in the Colorado time zone.
[03:50.530 --> 03:52.250]  I don't know what time zone you are in.
[03:52.250 --> 03:58.370]  You will have to adjust, but Monday afternoon, Monday evening, I guess it is at 7 PM mountain
[03:58.370 --> 04:00.450]  time around 7 10 PM.
[04:00.450 --> 04:03.410]  I jump on sometime between seven and seven 15.
[04:03.410 --> 04:04.970]  It's usually about seven 10.
[04:04.970 --> 04:06.470]  I jump on Instagram live.
[04:06.470 --> 04:09.210]  My Instagram is I re underscore genetics.
[04:09.210 --> 04:11.850]  I R I E underscore.
[04:11.850 --> 04:13.090]  Then you can spell genetics.
[04:13.090 --> 04:14.810]  I read genetics on Instagram.
[04:14.810 --> 04:19.410]  If you give me a follow there every Monday, approximately seven 10 PM, I hop on Instagram
[04:19.410 --> 04:20.410]  live.
[04:20.410 --> 04:23.310]  I try to say hi to everybody that comes into the live feed.
[04:23.310 --> 04:24.310]  Every name I see pop in.
[04:24.310 --> 04:25.310]  I try to say hello.
[04:25.310 --> 04:26.690]  I try to greet you.
[04:26.690 --> 04:27.690]  People come in my door.
[04:27.690 --> 04:29.450]  I try to say what's up to you personally.
[04:29.450 --> 04:31.130]  Sometimes Instagram doesn't show me that you popped in.
[04:31.130 --> 04:35.250]  Sometimes it'll say, uh, let's see, Riven waters and seven other people have popped
[04:35.250 --> 04:38.230]  in and I can't say hi to seven other, cause I don't know who you are.
[04:38.230 --> 04:39.570]  So I just give you a shout out when you come in.
[04:39.570 --> 04:44.330]  But on that Instagram live show, I will smoke plenty of dabs.
[04:44.350 --> 04:47.210]  I will read all of the comments.
[04:47.210 --> 04:50.530]  I will answer a bunch of questions and I will smoke a bunch of dabs.
[04:50.530 --> 04:54.710]  We listen to music, we hang out, we talk shit and it is a good smoke session and a hangout
[04:54.710 --> 04:58.770]  session is nowhere, nowhere near as formal as this podcast.
[04:58.770 --> 04:59.770]  It's all freestyle.
[04:59.770 --> 05:01.010]  It is all on the fly.
[05:01.010 --> 05:03.170]  The questions are all just shot to me randomly.
[05:03.170 --> 05:04.690]  I try to answer them all.
[05:04.690 --> 05:09.050]  So my point here, if you want to hang out and smoke with me, if you want to watch me
[05:09.050 --> 05:11.130]  smoke, take fat dabs, get too stoned.
[05:11.130 --> 05:12.130]  I get silly.
[05:12.130 --> 05:14.210]  You guys, I, I really get chilled out on that show.
[05:14.210 --> 05:16.690]  I smoke until I have to stop and go get food.
[05:16.690 --> 05:20.330]  So a Monday nights on Instagram, give me a follow on the Instagram.
[05:20.330 --> 05:24.490]  I re underscore genetics leads me to one more segue.
[05:24.490 --> 05:28.170]  I re the word is I re a lot of people call it eerie genetics.
[05:28.170 --> 05:29.170]  That's cool.
[05:29.170 --> 05:33.730]  If you want to call it area, it is a little creepy, but the word is I re I re is a Jamaican
[05:33.730 --> 05:34.730]  word.
[05:34.730 --> 05:38.730]  It means to just feel the best you could feel to mean it means to feel blessed and just
[05:38.730 --> 05:39.730]  good.
[05:39.730 --> 05:44.170]  Just feeling I re you know, when you're sitting for me, it's like a, on a hill.
[05:45.130 --> 05:47.410]  Just a nice hillside with a little breeze coming toward me.
[05:47.410 --> 05:48.410]  A nice grassy hill.
[05:48.410 --> 05:50.810]  You know, when you sit in the grass, the grass is just naturally cool.
[05:50.810 --> 05:54.450]  No matter how hot it is outside, that grass just feels good and cool on your body.
[05:54.450 --> 05:57.890]  You put your feet, your bare feet in that grass, rub your toes in the grass, your butts
[05:57.890 --> 05:58.890]  on the grass.
[05:58.890 --> 05:59.890]  I got clothes on guys.
[05:59.890 --> 06:00.890]  Don't worry.
[06:00.890 --> 06:03.970]  You got clothes on, but my butts on the grass, I got my palms touching that grass.
[06:03.970 --> 06:04.970]  It's nice and cool.
[06:04.970 --> 06:05.970]  And I'm just sitting there.
[06:05.970 --> 06:08.610]  I got a little bit of breeze blowing my dreadlocks out of my face.
[06:08.610 --> 06:09.610]  The sun is just right.
[06:09.610 --> 06:12.930]  So we were just kind of like, damn, it's bright, but you're not squinting and dying from it.
[06:13.090 --> 06:15.250]  And you're just maybe overlooking some water.
[06:15.250 --> 06:16.590]  Maybe you got your dog next to you.
[06:16.590 --> 06:19.810]  Maybe you got your, your partner with you, maybe your best friend, maybe your lover,
[06:19.810 --> 06:22.370]  maybe your boyfriend, girlfriend, maybe it's a unicorn.
[06:22.370 --> 06:23.370]  It's fucking 2021.
[06:23.370 --> 06:24.490]  You can have whatever you want next to you.
[06:24.490 --> 06:26.050]  That makes you feel the happiest.
[06:26.050 --> 06:28.810]  You feel that feeling right there when you're just chilling.
[06:28.810 --> 06:29.970]  Maybe you got a white claw on your hand.
[06:29.970 --> 06:30.970]  Cause it's 2021.
[06:30.970 --> 06:31.970]  I'm drinking a kombucha.
[06:31.970 --> 06:37.050]  You do what you want, but that is feeling I re just when you feel good, when the reggae
[06:37.050 --> 06:40.490]  music is playing at the concert and you're just bobbing your head and everybody's bobbing
[06:40.490 --> 06:45.170]  their head and the smoke's in the air and the sun is setting behind the stage and the
[06:45.170 --> 06:49.610]  reggae stars are dancing and the lights are popping up off the stage and you're just like,
[06:49.610 --> 06:54.730]  yeah, that feeling that is I re that's what I re means.
[06:54.730 --> 06:56.690]  I re I'm sure you've heard it in reggae music.
[06:56.690 --> 06:58.410]  You've heard it in Jamaican music.
[06:58.410 --> 07:02.170]  If you've gone to a reggae show, the reggae singer has said the word I re cause they are
[07:02.170 --> 07:04.770]  feeling I re they're making you feel I re.
[07:04.770 --> 07:05.850]  So I've said it enough times.
[07:05.850 --> 07:06.850]  It's not eerie.
[07:06.850 --> 07:12.290]  It's just I re I re genetics cause I'm inspired by a lot of Rastafari Jamaican culture.
[07:12.290 --> 07:15.290]  You'll also find a lot of grateful dead references in my strain names.
[07:15.290 --> 07:17.770]  Anyway, I wanted to say I re genetics.
[07:17.770 --> 07:18.770]  Find me on Instagram.
[07:18.770 --> 07:22.210]  Uh, that was a long ramble about the word I re, but we gotta, gotta teach the people.
[07:22.210 --> 07:28.530]  Now another question I get often asked is why is the podcast age restricted?
[07:28.530 --> 07:29.850]  Because I'm trying to keep the channel.
[07:29.850 --> 07:31.130]  I talk about cannabis.
[07:31.130 --> 07:32.250]  I say the F word.
[07:32.250 --> 07:34.770]  I drop a lot of fucking profane language on here.
[07:34.770 --> 07:39.130]  I tried to edit myself back in the day, but I found that I say fuck and there's no reason
[07:39.130 --> 07:40.130]  to cut that out.
[07:40.130 --> 07:41.170]  That's just something that I say.
[07:41.170 --> 07:42.410]  So it's going to be in the podcast.
[07:42.410 --> 07:44.530]  Therefore we must make it.
[07:44.530 --> 07:46.050]  It's gotta be, what's the word?
[07:46.050 --> 07:47.050]  Age restricted.
[07:47.050 --> 07:49.370]  Also I'm talking about cannabis.
[07:49.370 --> 07:53.630]  People who are under the age of 18 probably, uh, I don't know, maybe they shouldn't be
[07:53.630 --> 07:55.170]  learning about cannabis right away.
[07:55.170 --> 07:58.770]  It's not, it's somebody's, it's their parents responsibility until they're 18 to teach them
[07:58.770 --> 07:59.770]  about cannabis.
[07:59.770 --> 08:03.050]  The day after that, I'll teach you everything you want to know, but, um, tell them it's
[08:03.050 --> 08:04.910]  your parents responsibility to teach you.
[08:04.910 --> 08:06.690]  That's the technical legal shit, right?
[08:06.690 --> 08:08.570]  So that's why it's age restricted on YouTube.
[08:08.570 --> 08:09.730]  I want to keep the channel.
[08:09.730 --> 08:12.690]  I don't need little kids seeing the channel and leaving comments and telling their mom,
[08:12.690 --> 08:15.210]  Hey, I want to take dabs and be like Ross to Jeff.
[08:15.210 --> 08:16.210]  That would be fucking weird.
[08:16.210 --> 08:17.950]  So we keep it age restricted for the adults.
[08:17.950 --> 08:21.250]  All you've got to do is change on your Google account.
[08:21.250 --> 08:23.170]  Change your age to over 18.
[08:23.170 --> 08:26.290]  You better be 18 if you do that wink wink, but all you've got to do is go put in your
[08:26.290 --> 08:28.410]  birthday and change it and it will let you sign in.
[08:28.410 --> 08:31.330]  Somebody told me that YouTube wanted their credit card, bro.
[08:31.330 --> 08:32.330]  You're doing something wrong.
[08:32.330 --> 08:33.610]  YouTube does not want your credit card.
[08:33.610 --> 08:36.690]  You're probably not even seeing this cause you couldn't get that far.
[08:36.690 --> 08:40.490]  But, uh, YouTube is age restricted because I want to keep my channel.
[08:40.490 --> 08:44.130]  You guys, if it were not age restricted, little kids saw this might get me in trouble, not
[08:44.130 --> 08:45.130]  in trouble.
[08:45.130 --> 08:47.890]  Just get the channel taken down and I want you to be able to watch the show.
[08:47.890 --> 08:51.570]  We tried to post the videos other places and it doesn't get any views and it just sucks
[08:51.570 --> 08:52.570]  for loading.
[08:52.570 --> 08:53.570]  It takes too long.
[08:53.570 --> 08:54.570]  So we're just going to do it on the YouTube.
[08:54.570 --> 08:55.570]  We've got to keep the channel.
[08:55.570 --> 08:56.570]  All right.
[08:56.570 --> 08:57.570]  I've been rambling for quite some time.
[08:57.570 --> 09:00.730]  We have not gotten to the main cannabis portion of this podcast.
[09:00.970 --> 09:02.730]  I've got some great questions from me.
[09:02.730 --> 09:04.650]  This question came from the Patreon channel.
[09:04.650 --> 09:06.210]  This question comes from our friend.
[09:06.210 --> 09:08.690]  They want their name said, they said it right in the email.
[09:08.690 --> 09:10.450]  So we're just going to start by reading it.
[09:10.450 --> 09:13.610]  It says, actually I think I have two similar.
[09:13.610 --> 09:16.770]  Yeah, we got two emails with the same question.
[09:16.770 --> 09:18.030]  That's why we're going to do this.
[09:18.030 --> 09:20.090]  The first one comes from, it says, what's up Rasta Jeff.
[09:20.090 --> 09:21.690]  We got Papa Z here.
[09:21.690 --> 09:23.690]  You are welcome to use my name on the air.
[09:23.690 --> 09:24.690]  That's what I needed.
[09:24.690 --> 09:28.370]  It says, thank you for everything you do for all of us who strive to be better growers
[09:28.370 --> 09:30.610]  and just plain better in life, bro.
[09:31.490 --> 09:32.490]  Thank you.
[09:32.490 --> 09:34.450]  I'm glad I'm making you a better grower and I'm glad it is making you be a better person
[09:34.450 --> 09:35.450]  in life.
[09:35.450 --> 09:36.450]  Big respect.
[09:36.450 --> 09:37.450]  I appreciate that.
[09:37.450 --> 09:39.150]  It says I won't ramble on as usual.
[09:39.150 --> 09:40.650]  Thank you because I've done enough of that.
[09:40.650 --> 09:42.650]  It says, here is my question.
[09:42.650 --> 09:47.730]  I just popped a pack of strawberry starburst and I want to know in your opinion, is it
[09:47.730 --> 09:52.490]  better to take a cutting as soon as I am able from each seedling and then plant that cutting
[09:52.490 --> 09:58.650]  after it roots and flip that and find the males very reasonable method or should I just
[09:58.690 --> 10:04.290]  flip the seedling and then switch it back to veg after finding the male, finding them
[10:04.290 --> 10:06.970]  show their sex and thanks for the videos.
[10:06.970 --> 10:07.970]  They're freaking epic.
[10:07.970 --> 10:11.210]  So I did post some videos on topping and cloning and people have made a lot of comments on
[10:11.210 --> 10:12.210]  those.
[10:12.210 --> 10:14.610]  You're very welcome and thanks for watching the videos.
[10:14.610 --> 10:19.690]  My answer, the short, oh, he wraps it up with much love and jaw guide from Papa Z.
[10:19.690 --> 10:21.730]  My short answer is yes.
[10:21.730 --> 10:26.010]  I'm going to read another question that is very similar to this and then I think we are
[10:26.010 --> 10:28.290]  going to give you some answers.
[10:28.450 --> 10:31.850]  So let me read this next question and we'll delve deeper into the answer to this.
[10:31.850 --> 10:34.090]  This one says, I have a question.
[10:34.090 --> 10:39.010]  Being a Michigan resident, we are now limited to 12 plants for recreational growing.
[10:39.010 --> 10:41.850]  Like to maximize these gorilla cookie seeds.
[10:41.850 --> 10:43.490]  I hope you guys didn't just hear my stomach rumble.
[10:43.490 --> 10:44.890]  I apologize if that came through.
[10:44.890 --> 10:45.890]  Wow.
[10:45.890 --> 10:47.170]  Somebody feed the hippie.
[10:47.170 --> 10:48.170]  Where are we?
[10:48.170 --> 10:51.970]  I've got these gorilla cookie seeds I was given from a friend in order to audition these
[10:51.970 --> 10:53.770]  plants before going outside.
[10:53.770 --> 10:54.770]  Very wise move.
[10:54.770 --> 10:55.770]  Thank you.
[10:55.770 --> 10:56.770]  You have listened to my podcast previously.
[10:56.890 --> 11:00.130]  I hate it when people put plants outside that they have not auditioned.
[11:00.130 --> 11:03.050]  If you don't know if that plant's a male or a female, please don't put it outside.
[11:03.050 --> 11:05.410]  Don't pollinate all the other outdoor grows.
[11:05.410 --> 11:07.730]  This person has the right idea.
[11:07.730 --> 11:10.890]  Before putting it outside, I was thinking I would start them inside my tent and veg
[11:10.890 --> 11:11.890]  for eight weeks.
[11:11.890 --> 11:13.330]  You're going to have good size plants.
[11:13.330 --> 11:17.170]  Flip to flower and weed out the males since I'm not breeding or looking to fuck up someone
[11:17.170 --> 11:18.170]  else's grow.
[11:18.170 --> 11:19.530]  Very good forethought.
[11:19.530 --> 11:20.530]  Thank you.
[11:20.530 --> 11:21.530]  Big respect for that.
[11:21.530 --> 11:22.530]  I'm glad you're thinking ahead.
[11:22.530 --> 11:25.050]  And then re-veg the females to go outdoors.
[11:25.050 --> 11:29.330]  Is this going to stress the girls too much or no?
[11:29.330 --> 11:34.010]  Then at the bottom of your question, bro, I wrote the word perfect.
[11:34.010 --> 11:35.970]  That's the best way to do it.
[11:35.970 --> 11:37.610]  Audition them before you put them outside.
[11:37.610 --> 11:42.090]  Flip them into flower, wait to see what the males are, then re-veg the females and put
[11:42.090 --> 11:43.430]  the females outside.
[11:43.430 --> 11:45.910]  That is a very beautiful strategy.
[11:45.910 --> 11:49.050]  This is very similar to the question we were asked previously.
[11:49.050 --> 11:50.650]  So let's delve into this.
[11:50.650 --> 11:54.110]  This is kind of the same answer, the same question here for both of these.
[11:54.170 --> 11:58.430]  The main question is I'm trying to determine how to sex my plants.
[11:58.430 --> 12:02.310]  They want to find the quickest ways of sexing their plants to determine if they've got males
[12:02.310 --> 12:03.310]  or females.
[12:03.310 --> 12:07.710]  So that way we don't waste time putting ... This guy is going to put their plants outdoors.
[12:07.710 --> 12:10.210]  He's going to veg for eight weeks and then put them outside.
[12:10.210 --> 12:11.390]  That's a big plant.
[12:11.390 --> 12:13.910]  If you put those giant plants outside, they're going to be huge.
[12:13.910 --> 12:18.150]  When they start to turn, they show their sex on you, that could pollinate the whole fucking
[12:18.150 --> 12:19.150]  neighborhood.
[12:19.150 --> 12:20.630]  So we don't want to put that male outside.
[12:20.630 --> 12:23.710]  Our other friend is going to be growing in a tent and wants to make the best out of their
[12:23.710 --> 12:26.910]  seeds and they don't want to waste space.
[12:26.910 --> 12:29.830]  Very reasonable, reasonable expectations here.
[12:29.830 --> 12:33.610]  What I would recommend for my friend who's going to go outdoors and would also work for
[12:33.610 --> 12:36.870]  Papa Z, I would take a clone from those plants.
[12:36.870 --> 12:38.650]  You're going to veg for eight weeks.
[12:38.650 --> 12:43.430]  We could probably top around week three and get a good clone.
[12:43.430 --> 12:45.830]  Like the top, it's going to bush out and it's going to make a top.
[12:45.830 --> 12:48.050]  I've showed you this part on video before.
[12:48.050 --> 12:50.470]  Take that top and make a clone out of the top.
[12:50.470 --> 12:53.670]  If you have another space, this is what I would do.
[12:53.670 --> 12:57.750]  Take the clone out of the top of each of your plants, label your plants, plant a plant
[12:57.750 --> 13:00.270]  B plant C, uh, however many you have.
[13:00.270 --> 13:01.270]  You have 10 of them do numbers.
[13:01.270 --> 13:02.270]  You have 12 do numbers.
[13:02.270 --> 13:03.270]  It's going to be easier.
[13:03.270 --> 13:08.110]  Uh, do numbers one through 12 then take a clone and label your clones appropriately.
[13:08.110 --> 13:10.670]  Clone one clone two so that they match up with the planet came from.
[13:10.670 --> 13:12.150]  I hope that makes sense.
[13:12.150 --> 13:16.230]  Uh, then put those clones under 1212 lighting.
[13:16.230 --> 13:19.550]  The clones will begin to root and while they are rooting, that will show you if they're
[13:19.550 --> 13:23.230]  male or female and about 1012 maybe 14 days.
[13:23.790 --> 13:25.990]  So then you don't have to veg giant plants.
[13:25.990 --> 13:28.670]  You don't have to veg them out for five extra weeks.
[13:28.670 --> 13:29.670]  Should they be boys?
[13:29.670 --> 13:34.150]  You can get rid of them even sooner than flipping the plants, putting them into veg and then
[13:34.150 --> 13:35.150]  finding out.
[13:35.150 --> 13:39.410]  So the sooner you can flip them into flower or cut a clone would be better.
[13:39.410 --> 13:40.590]  Don't let them get too big.
[13:40.590 --> 13:41.590]  Then do it.
[13:41.590 --> 13:42.590]  Do it early.
[13:42.590 --> 13:43.590]  You can do it when they're tiny.
[13:43.590 --> 13:44.590]  You can do it.
[13:44.590 --> 13:47.870]  Uh, as soon as you have a plant, you know what I mean by when it goes from a seedling
[13:47.870 --> 13:51.710]  to looking like a plant, once you think it's an actual plant, then put that fucker into
[13:51.710 --> 13:52.710]  flower.
[13:53.190 --> 13:56.750]  So they're going to be a foot tall, 10 inches tall, and they're going to be 14 inches tall.
[13:56.750 --> 14:00.310]  By the time you find out they're into flower, then put it back into veg and then up pot
[14:00.310 --> 14:02.410]  it and it will revege more quickly.
[14:02.410 --> 14:04.990]  So that'll save you time, uh, save you some space.
[14:04.990 --> 14:07.870]  If you've got that second space, uh, you can do the clones.
[14:07.870 --> 14:11.470]  If not flower out that original mom plant and find out what you've got.
[14:11.470 --> 14:13.030]  That way you don't grow it so big.
[14:13.030 --> 14:15.510]  I hate wasting time, space, energy.
[14:15.510 --> 14:18.910]  I could have put different plants in there and had a whole new project underway that
[14:18.910 --> 14:21.750]  I know that that one big pot was wasting all my space.
[14:21.750 --> 14:22.790]  That's the way I think about it.
[14:22.790 --> 14:25.030]  Real estate's expensive in a grow environment.
[14:25.030 --> 14:27.110]  Now we're going to lean back over here to Papa Z's question.
[14:27.110 --> 14:28.110]  It's similar.
[14:28.110 --> 14:29.110]  It's a very similar thing.
[14:29.110 --> 14:33.710]  My question is, uh, is it better to take a cutting as soon as I'm able, uh, and then
[14:33.710 --> 14:38.510]  plant the cutting as it roots and then flip that to find the males or flip the seedlings.
[14:38.510 --> 14:40.910]  So about three weeks into veg, take a clone.
[14:40.910 --> 14:42.970]  If you've got the opportunity, let's see, we'll take cutting.
[14:42.970 --> 14:45.910]  So take cuttings about three weeks into veg, take a cutting.
[14:45.910 --> 14:49.130]  Now you've got this big mom plant and you've got the cuttings.
[14:49.130 --> 14:54.330]  You can at that point put that cutting into a flower immediately and it will show you
[14:54.330 --> 14:56.290]  which ones are the males and females.
[14:56.290 --> 15:00.770]  Now you can, uh, toss the males immediately if you want to and you can keep the females.
[15:00.770 --> 15:03.790]  Now you've already got backup clones of those plants.
[15:03.790 --> 15:07.170]  So you've got a mother plant for the future.
[15:07.170 --> 15:11.130]  So if one of these plants turns out to be stellar and you want to keep it forever, or
[15:11.130 --> 15:14.050]  maybe you just don't have more plants to grow, maybe you want to keep something around to
[15:14.050 --> 15:16.990]  grow in the future so you don't have to keep popping seeds and sexing stuff.
[15:16.990 --> 15:19.270]  You can find one that's reliable.
[15:19.270 --> 15:20.270]  Then you've got a clone for it.
[15:20.270 --> 15:22.350]  It's already there in the clone dome.
[15:22.350 --> 15:25.030]  So that is one thing that is very advantageous.
[15:25.030 --> 15:28.590]  So if you've got a clone of each of those plants and you put them into flower, they
[15:28.590 --> 15:33.270]  will show you sex about the same timeframe that it would take if you put the original
[15:33.270 --> 15:36.490]  plant into flower and then let it show you sex.
[15:36.490 --> 15:39.990]  It's going to take about the same amount of time, 10, 12, maybe 14 days.
[15:39.990 --> 15:42.190]  They're both going into flower.
[15:42.190 --> 15:44.730]  If you do it with the main plant, then you've got to re-veg it.
[15:44.730 --> 15:47.230]  If you do it with the clones, there's no re-veg happening.
[15:47.230 --> 15:51.910]  So if you've got the option in this case, I would probably take the clones and flower
[15:51.910 --> 15:57.910]  those out, find the males, pull the males, and that way you don't have the main mommy
[15:57.910 --> 16:00.890]  or the main plant that you started with is not in flower.
[16:00.890 --> 16:02.250]  You don't have to revert it.
[16:02.250 --> 16:06.370]  It's going to take you a week or two to get it back into the vegetative stage.
[16:06.370 --> 16:07.370]  Then you've got to re-veg it.
[16:07.370 --> 16:08.990]  Then it's going to regrow again.
[16:08.990 --> 16:13.690]  You could skip that two week stress period right there just by flowering out that clone.
[16:13.690 --> 16:17.290]  Then you've got a flowered clone that will work as a mother.
[16:17.290 --> 16:21.490]  You can re-veg that clone and that will work as a mother if you choose to keep it as a
[16:21.490 --> 16:25.570]  mother or just let that plant grow because you already know that it's a female because
[16:25.570 --> 16:27.150]  you've gotten a clone off of it.
[16:27.150 --> 16:30.970]  Take more clones again if you choose to keep it and then let that be your mother plant
[16:30.970 --> 16:31.970]  for the future.
[16:31.970 --> 16:32.970]  Take clones later on in the future.
[16:32.970 --> 16:34.850]  It wouldn't be a bad idea.
[16:34.850 --> 16:37.690]  I think that makes sense of what I'm talking about.
[16:37.690 --> 16:40.670]  To be honest with you, all of your methods would work.
[16:40.670 --> 16:41.930]  All of your ideas would work.
[16:42.170 --> 16:44.090]  What is best for you?
[16:44.090 --> 16:45.450]  You can cut clones.
[16:45.450 --> 16:47.370]  Then you can either flip the clone.
[16:47.370 --> 16:52.370]  You can either flip the mom or you can flip and return the mom.
[16:52.370 --> 16:55.450]  Sometimes we just put the mom into the flowering room and let them go.
[16:55.450 --> 16:58.650]  Then you just pull them out and chop them down and throw them away at that point if
[16:58.650 --> 17:02.130]  you find out that it's a male or a female or you keep the females is what I'm saying.
[17:02.130 --> 17:03.130]  You let the females keep going.
[17:03.130 --> 17:04.810]  If it's a boy, you just chop it down.
[17:04.810 --> 17:06.170]  Then you just got that big plant in there.
[17:06.170 --> 17:07.170]  You're just running the risk.
[17:07.170 --> 17:09.450]  An experienced grower can spot the boys pretty quickly.
[17:09.450 --> 17:10.930]  We'll just go pull them out.
[17:10.930 --> 17:13.930]  If you got a female and you didn't get clones at that point, you could pull it out, put
[17:13.930 --> 17:15.690]  it back and veg.
[17:15.690 --> 17:17.030]  Take a clone and flip it.
[17:17.030 --> 17:21.090]  Flip the mom and let it go or flip the mom until it shows you and then revege it are
[17:21.090 --> 17:22.090]  the options.
[17:22.090 --> 17:23.930]  Both of you guys have a great strategy.
[17:23.930 --> 17:26.730]  It's just all about deciding what works best for you.
[17:26.730 --> 17:30.370]  I think Papa Z and I think both of you guys are option.
[17:30.370 --> 17:33.850]  Round week three, take a clone and put that tray of clones into flower immediately.
[17:33.850 --> 17:38.590]  In 14 days, you'll know what you've got if you have the extra space to do so.
[17:38.590 --> 17:41.870]  My friend that's going outdoors, I would recommend that you flower those plants a little
[17:41.870 --> 17:43.890]  bit earlier than you anticipated.
[17:43.890 --> 17:47.150]  That way they got time to revege and you don't waste so much time and space with the plant
[17:47.150 --> 17:48.150]  that you don't need.
[17:48.150 --> 17:52.690]  You don't have to water it, feed it, take care of it, waste space with it if it is indeed
[17:52.690 --> 17:53.690]  a male plant.
[17:53.690 --> 17:55.350]  All right, that was a long time for two emails.
[17:55.350 --> 17:58.430]  I hope I answered a lot of questions for you guys there.
[17:58.430 --> 17:59.430]  Let's see.
[17:59.430 --> 18:00.430]  Should I jump into this next one?
[18:00.430 --> 18:03.750]  Yes, we've got plenty of time to jump into this next email.
[18:03.750 --> 18:08.630]  This next one comes from my friend Zachary and it came from Patreon at patreon.com forward
[18:08.630 --> 18:10.270]  slash grow from your heart.
[18:10.270 --> 18:11.950]  It goes just like this.
[18:11.950 --> 18:15.270]  It says, sir, it doesn't slur like that, I promise you.
[18:15.270 --> 18:18.230]  It says, sir, I just thought of another question.
[18:18.230 --> 18:22.270]  I've been using CO2 mushroom bags for shits and giggles and I can honestly say that I
[18:22.270 --> 18:25.550]  have no idea if it helped or not.
[18:25.550 --> 18:30.430]  If you can't quantify results in some sort of way, it was not cost effective.
[18:30.430 --> 18:35.550]  You just donated money to that company is basically what you did there.
[18:35.550 --> 18:36.750]  Did you use a meter or something?
[18:36.750 --> 18:38.910]  We're going to keep going.
[18:38.910 --> 18:40.870]  Have I measured the CO2 in the room?
[18:40.870 --> 18:45.750]  No, but I keep close attention to my ladies and I visit these hoes every day.
[18:45.750 --> 18:47.510]  They have a pretty steady pattern about them.
[18:47.510 --> 18:52.990]  My question is, do you use CO2 supplementation and what are the factors that would make it
[18:52.990 --> 18:56.810]  worth it from a tent grower to a building sized operation?
[18:56.810 --> 19:02.250]  The factors in mind here are obvious temperature, humidity, but also a room being sealed enough,
[19:02.250 --> 19:04.690]  air circulation, et cetera.
[19:04.690 --> 19:05.930]  There's a lot to touch on already.
[19:05.930 --> 19:10.050]  He does say, side note, I've been growing three breeder seeds, including yours.
[19:10.050 --> 19:13.850]  And from what I'm seeing so far, yours are killing it in my tent conditions.
[19:13.850 --> 19:16.970]  And those extra seeds you gave me went to some growers in need.
[19:16.970 --> 19:18.130]  Thanks again.
[19:18.130 --> 19:21.370]  That's a great way to wrap up that message because it says that my seeds are outperforming
[19:21.370 --> 19:24.630]  other breeders and it also shows that I gave you extra seeds.
[19:24.630 --> 19:25.630]  That's really cool.
[19:25.630 --> 19:27.350]  I appreciate you sharing that with us.
[19:27.350 --> 19:29.290]  Let's focus on this question here.
[19:29.290 --> 19:33.990]  Talking about CO2 in a room, a sealed room is a big factor.
[19:33.990 --> 19:35.390]  Where is that CO2 going?
[19:35.390 --> 19:37.990]  How are you exhausting your tent?
[19:37.990 --> 19:41.870]  Most of the time we put a blower at the top of the tent or a carbon filter somewhere near
[19:41.870 --> 19:42.870]  the top.
[19:42.870 --> 19:45.650]  It's exhausting the air out of the top, blowing it out of the tent.
[19:45.650 --> 19:50.670]  Does that ducting go out of a window, out of the domicile, out of the building, or does
[19:50.670 --> 19:56.070]  it blow the air back into the office space, bedroom, living room, basement, attic, wherever
[19:56.070 --> 19:57.830]  you might have this grow tent?
[19:57.830 --> 19:59.710]  Is that air being blown back into there?
[19:59.710 --> 20:02.710]  If it's going out the window, your CO2 is now out the window.
[20:02.710 --> 20:04.350]  It's part of the atmosphere.
[20:04.350 --> 20:06.550]  You just CO2'd up the neighborhood with the mushroom bag.
[20:06.550 --> 20:11.630]  You honestly probably didn't do shit, but you blew the CO2 right out the window if you
[20:11.630 --> 20:13.190]  had the ducting going out the window.
[20:13.190 --> 20:18.070]  If you're blowing that air back into the room, it had the opportunity to get sucked in through
[20:18.070 --> 20:22.390]  the passive vents on the bottom or maybe you've got an active intake near the bottom
[20:22.390 --> 20:27.150]  of that tent, but possibly some of it, a portion of it got sucked back in through the bottom
[20:27.150 --> 20:30.550]  and then cycled back up through your tent again.
[20:30.550 --> 20:33.410]  Also it mixed into the rest of the atmosphere in the room.
[20:33.410 --> 20:34.550]  How big is that room?
[20:34.550 --> 20:36.990]  How much air flow is in that room?
[20:36.990 --> 20:38.110]  Is there a door open?
[20:38.110 --> 20:39.210]  Is there a window open?
[20:39.210 --> 20:41.990]  Is that door open to the rest of the house?
[20:41.990 --> 20:45.990]  Is that tent in a 9,000 square foot warehouse by itself?
[20:45.990 --> 20:49.590]  Is it in a five by seven bedroom that is stifled?
[20:49.590 --> 20:53.710]  These are gonna be huge factors that come into play to decide.
[20:53.710 --> 20:54.710]  It's all about air flow.
[20:54.710 --> 20:58.270]  Cubic feet, amount of fucking CO2 you've introduced into the room.
[20:58.270 --> 20:59.630]  Where did it go?
[20:59.630 --> 21:03.290]  It's all about the cycling and recycling and the amount of sealed environment you've got
[21:03.290 --> 21:04.290]  in there.
[21:04.290 --> 21:07.350]  If you're just blowing it out the window, you're literally just blowing it out the window.
[21:07.350 --> 21:10.990]  If it's sealed in there and there's nowhere for it to go, it's circling back in there,
[21:10.990 --> 21:15.670]  but also that tells me that your room is probably too hot and probably kind of humid
[21:15.670 --> 21:20.550]  also unless you've got the appropriate equipment in there to combat that.
[21:20.550 --> 21:21.550]  Let's see.
[21:21.550 --> 21:24.870]  I like to aim for fairly high PPMs.
[21:24.870 --> 21:27.770]  In my personal grows, I do not run CO2.
[21:27.770 --> 21:28.770]  It's extra work.
[21:28.770 --> 21:31.430]  It's a couple of extra trips to the growth store.
[21:31.430 --> 21:35.310]  I feel like my plants are ... The plants I'm working with are high performance plants.
[21:35.310 --> 21:37.370]  People always tell me my plants veg faster.
[21:37.370 --> 21:39.230]  They flower with much more vigor.
[21:39.270 --> 21:44.030]  A little bit of CO2 may make my plants go too fast and mess up my whole schedule.
[21:44.030 --> 21:45.650]  Most of my stuff is in a small space.
[21:45.650 --> 21:48.110]  My personal stuff is in a very small space.
[21:48.110 --> 21:51.910]  I don't feel the need to augment the CO2 there.
[21:51.910 --> 21:53.870]  Also most of what I'm breeding for is for seeds.
[21:53.870 --> 21:55.150]  I don't need big fat buds.
[21:55.150 --> 21:56.750]  I'd get bigger plants with faster growth.
[21:56.750 --> 21:59.270]  I'm not worried on that big accelerated bud growth.
[21:59.270 --> 22:02.810]  I want healthy seeds, so that's mainly what I focus on.
[22:02.810 --> 22:07.390]  In a commercial grow environment, I CO2 up those rooms heavily.
[22:07.510 --> 22:12.950]  Somewhere between 1,000 and 1,400 PPMs, just depending on what part of the flowering cycle
[22:12.950 --> 22:13.950]  we are in.
[22:13.950 --> 22:16.110]  In veg, I stay around 1,000.
[22:16.110 --> 22:20.330]  The flowering times, we'll crank it up to about 1,400 PPMs.
[22:20.330 --> 22:26.290]  It gets quite expensive to augment CO2 in a large environment.
[22:26.290 --> 22:31.510]  If I notice that we can't keep it up, if we need more CO2 being dumped into the room that
[22:31.510 --> 22:35.150]  is cost effective, I'll simply just keep the PPMs closer to 1,000.
[22:35.150 --> 22:40.190]  If we can keep it in the room, if it's a smaller room, better sealed, better airflow,
[22:40.190 --> 22:43.690]  that's when I'll crank it up in the later weeks of flower.
[22:43.690 --> 22:48.830]  Not the final weeks, but the later weeks of flower, I'll really crank up that CO2.
[22:48.830 --> 22:51.950]  The factors are, it's all about sealed.
[22:51.950 --> 22:53.510]  How are you providing the CO2?
[22:53.510 --> 22:54.670]  Is it coming from a burner?
[22:54.670 --> 22:58.750]  If it's coming from a burner, you were just limited by the performance of that burner
[22:58.750 --> 23:00.390]  and the heat that it puts off as well.
[23:00.390 --> 23:04.970]  Can you turn that bitch up enough to saturate the room at the desired level with the amount
[23:04.970 --> 23:08.170]  of sealed sealing that you've done in that room?
[23:08.170 --> 23:10.610]  If you're using tanks, that gets expensive.
[23:10.610 --> 23:12.530]  You've got to refill the tanks.
[23:12.530 --> 23:17.910]  Can you saturate the room with CO2 at the level you desire and maintain those tanks?
[23:17.910 --> 23:20.530]  Can you get to the store as often as you need to?
[23:20.530 --> 23:24.690]  Can you carry in those tanks as often as you need to without your neighbors seeing you?
[23:24.690 --> 23:28.850]  CO2 tanks being carried into the house looks super fucking sketchy.
[23:28.850 --> 23:31.610]  People don't realize you may use CO2 for a cannabis grow.
[23:31.610 --> 23:33.770]  They think you're doing something way different.
[23:33.770 --> 23:35.930]  The kids in the neighborhood are going to think you got helium and they're going to
[23:35.930 --> 23:37.650]  want fucking helium balloons.
[23:37.650 --> 23:41.490]  So if you got that CO2 tank, you're going to have to move that into the house a couple
[23:41.490 --> 23:44.130]  of times a week or a couple of times a month or something.
[23:44.130 --> 23:45.130]  Think about that.
[23:45.130 --> 23:46.130]  Do you want to move that?
[23:46.130 --> 23:48.250]  Also, that gets expensive.
[23:48.250 --> 23:52.730]  If your room is not sealed properly, you're just ducting that shit right out the window.
[23:52.730 --> 23:57.570]  You just drove, picked it up, snuck it into the house, paid for it, hooked it up and then
[23:57.570 --> 23:59.330]  vented it right out the damn window.
[23:59.330 --> 24:01.770]  So unless you're sealing the room, that is not cost effective.
[24:01.770 --> 24:04.050]  What are the other methods of creating CO2?
[24:04.050 --> 24:05.530]  We got the tanks, we got the burner.
[24:05.530 --> 24:07.570]  Oh, we got these mushroom bags.
[24:07.570 --> 24:10.090]  I really don't know if those are effective.
[24:10.090 --> 24:11.090]  Let's talk about that.
[24:11.090 --> 24:14.970]  Unless you're getting out a meter, you said you do not use a meter.
[24:14.970 --> 24:20.410]  Unless you're getting out a meter, there's no real way to measure the amount of CO2 in
[24:20.410 --> 24:21.410]  the room.
[24:21.410 --> 24:25.050]  I've got a lot of meters in the commercial environment that tell me what the CO2 is throughout
[24:25.050 --> 24:26.050]  the room.
[24:26.050 --> 24:29.930]  I've got it set up to where if the CO2 is too high here, too low here, it'll actually
[24:29.930 --> 24:32.730]  turn on in this region and not in this region.
[24:32.730 --> 24:34.130]  Fans will kick on and move CO2.
[24:34.130 --> 24:36.850]  It's a pretty advanced room in some of these places.
[24:36.850 --> 24:37.970]  You've got to have the meters.
[24:37.970 --> 24:41.730]  We also have these big meters that if it gets dangerously high, the fucking alarms go off
[24:41.730 --> 24:43.150]  and it tells us to leave the building.
[24:43.150 --> 24:44.150]  It's pretty cool.
[24:44.150 --> 24:47.650]  I had that happen once, almost shit my pants, scared the shit out of me.
[24:47.650 --> 24:50.370]  But we do have a lot of CO2 monitoring in the commercial environments.
[24:50.370 --> 24:51.370]  You need a monitor.
[24:51.370 --> 24:54.490]  If you're going to pay for the juice, you got to monitor the juice.
[24:54.490 --> 24:57.450]  You got to get the equipment that goes with it or you don't even know if you're doing
[24:57.450 --> 24:58.450]  anything.
[24:58.450 --> 25:02.250]  You got to have some sort of quantifiable data, also quantifiable results.
[25:02.250 --> 25:06.410]  If you put that in there and you didn't get any results out of it, it was not cost effective,
[25:06.410 --> 25:08.490]  which means it didn't do, it wasn't cost effective.
[25:08.490 --> 25:12.730]  I wouldn't do it again unless you got more out of spending more money.
[25:12.730 --> 25:15.090]  Don't do it again unless the quality is better.
[25:15.090 --> 25:17.610]  We're not looking, I don't think quality is going to be better because of CO2.
[25:17.610 --> 25:20.690]  You're just looking for bigger, fatter plants, bigger, fatter buds.
[25:20.690 --> 25:22.330]  So you need a meter.
[25:22.330 --> 25:24.450]  I would optimize the room.
[25:24.450 --> 25:26.890]  The tent is in a room in your situation.
[25:26.890 --> 25:31.970]  I would optimize the room in which the tent is in because that room is working as a lung
[25:31.970 --> 25:32.970]  room.
[25:32.970 --> 25:36.010]  You've got your main environment in the tent and then outside, that air gets to mix around
[25:36.010 --> 25:40.690]  again and kind of stabilize itself to the room temperature, which was going to be whatever
[25:40.690 --> 25:41.690]  ambient environment is.
[25:41.690 --> 25:42.690]  If it's a hot day, it's going to be hot.
[25:42.690 --> 25:46.290]  If it's cool, it's going to be cool, but it's getting to mix in there again and kind of
[25:46.290 --> 25:48.690]  stabilize itself before it gets sucked back into the room.
[25:48.690 --> 25:54.330]  If you can keep that room closed and keep the CO2 augmented in that room as well, that
[25:54.330 --> 25:55.330]  will help you out.
[25:55.330 --> 25:59.970]  I would have people adjust the temperature and humidity of the room in which the tent
[25:59.970 --> 26:00.970]  is in.
[26:00.970 --> 26:02.210]  I wouldn't put my air conditioner in the tent.
[26:02.210 --> 26:06.970]  I would put it in the bedroom, which the tent is in, put my humidifier and dehumidifier
[26:06.970 --> 26:11.810]  in that room, adjust that temperature, and then blow that perfect air into the tent and
[26:11.810 --> 26:14.290]  then suck out the bad air out of the top of the tent.
[26:14.290 --> 26:17.730]  So I'd be augmenting the CO2 in that big room as well.
[26:17.730 --> 26:21.570]  I know that sounds silly, but from a commercial grower standpoint, from a very experienced
[26:21.570 --> 26:23.210]  grower standpoint, that's the way to do it.
[26:23.210 --> 26:26.250]  Now what you're going to have to do at that point is make sure that room is sealed.
[26:26.250 --> 26:29.250]  Are you evacuating air out of that room somehow?
[26:29.250 --> 26:31.650]  Are people opening the door, coming in and out of that room?
[26:31.650 --> 26:35.490]  If it's an active house or an active room in the house, this may not be the best way
[26:35.490 --> 26:36.490]  to do it.
[26:36.490 --> 26:40.610]  You may just want to rock it without CO2 or just be the guy that puts a little tank right
[26:40.610 --> 26:45.610]  outside there and runs the lines right into the tent and then just drops that CO2 right
[26:45.610 --> 26:46.610]  in there.
[26:46.610 --> 26:49.970]  It could get wasteful, but it's going right to the plants that way.
[26:49.970 --> 26:50.970]  That works too.
[26:50.970 --> 26:52.690]  Just try not to waste it.
[26:52.690 --> 26:53.690]  Is it expensive?
[26:53.690 --> 26:54.690]  Is it cost effective?
[26:54.690 --> 26:55.690]  I would get meters.
[26:55.690 --> 26:57.010]  I would take a lot of notes.
[26:57.010 --> 26:58.450]  We need quantifiable data.
[26:58.450 --> 27:02.330]  Run two or three harvests of the same strain, of the same plants for the same amount of
[27:02.330 --> 27:03.650]  time with the same feed.
[27:03.650 --> 27:06.890]  If you want it to be scientific, you have to do it scientifically.
[27:06.890 --> 27:09.390]  I know I said scientifically.
[27:09.390 --> 27:13.170]  If you can't seal that room up the way I said before, put the tanks right outside of the
[27:13.170 --> 27:17.970]  tent, run your lines right inside the tent and run that perforated drip line right above
[27:17.970 --> 27:20.690]  the plants, like six or eight inches above the canopy.
[27:20.690 --> 27:22.390]  Make a loop all the way around that tent.
[27:23.090 --> 27:25.830]  You could do a cross across the middle if you can run the lines that way so that CO2
[27:25.830 --> 27:29.630]  is dropping right into the canopy of those plants and then your extraction fan will suck
[27:29.630 --> 27:30.630]  it up.
[27:30.630 --> 27:32.350]  It's heavier than oxygen so it's going to fall.
[27:32.350 --> 27:35.230]  When that extraction fan comes on, it will pull it back up.
[27:35.230 --> 27:38.670]  Hopefully it sucks it into the room and then that extraction fan is pulling passive air
[27:38.670 --> 27:39.670]  into the bottom.
[27:39.670 --> 27:44.130]  Hopefully, like I said before, it brings it right back into that tent once it recycles
[27:44.130 --> 27:45.130]  with the air outside.
[27:45.130 --> 27:46.910]  You're going to need meters.
[27:46.910 --> 27:48.190]  That's my main advice, bro.
[27:48.190 --> 27:50.910]  Find a meter and see what the meter says.
[27:50.910 --> 27:55.750]  You're probably going to start off around 350 to 420 ppm of CO2 in your room.
[27:55.750 --> 27:58.850]  That's naturally what the environment seems to be lately.
[27:58.850 --> 28:01.510]  See what you can do by augmenting it with these cheap bags.
[28:01.510 --> 28:05.090]  See if you want to invest in more expensive equipment, pumping up the CO2.
[28:05.090 --> 28:08.670]  If you get it high and you get a good pattern and figure out what each strain likes, it
[28:08.670 --> 28:09.870]  will increase your bulk.
[28:09.870 --> 28:12.630]  It will make the plants beef up, bulk up, fatten up.
[28:12.630 --> 28:18.350]  You will notice faster growth because of that CO2 if you can get it dialed in.
[28:18.350 --> 28:22.550]  I wrote a high ppm show results, but is it cost effective?
[28:22.550 --> 28:24.350]  That is the main thing to think about.
[28:24.350 --> 28:25.350]  Cost effective.
[28:25.350 --> 28:27.670]  If it's not cost effective, cut it out.
[28:27.670 --> 28:31.250]  The only way to find out is to seal up that room, let that shit rip and see what it does
[28:31.250 --> 28:32.250]  for your plants.
[28:32.250 --> 28:33.250]  All right.
[28:33.250 --> 28:35.910]  Zachary, thank you for the great Patreon question.
[28:35.910 --> 28:39.550]  I want to thank everybody who sent me messages today for the continued Patreon support.
[28:39.550 --> 28:41.790]  I do see your names on a lot of my things.
[28:41.790 --> 28:43.590]  My Instagram, I see you pop up.
[28:43.590 --> 28:45.150]  I see you on my Patreon all the time.
[28:45.150 --> 28:46.510]  I see you in the discord.
[28:46.510 --> 28:49.070]  I appreciate the community interaction.
[28:49.070 --> 28:52.190]  Big shout out to the Iry Army, the Grow From Your Heart podcast crew.
[28:52.190 --> 28:53.190]  Gang, gang.
[28:53.190 --> 28:55.310]  I do appreciate each and every one of you.
[28:55.310 --> 28:57.350]  Thank you guys for the big, big support.
[28:57.350 --> 28:58.350]  All right.
[28:58.350 --> 29:00.670]  I do feel like I've answered a couple of questions for this episode.
[29:00.670 --> 29:02.670]  I feel like I went for about 30-ish minutes.
[29:02.670 --> 29:04.750]  I tried to give you a 30-minute episode.
[29:04.750 --> 29:09.690]  The numbers show me that people stop listening, dead on stop listening at 36 minutes.
[29:09.690 --> 29:14.010]  People start checking out about 18 minutes, so I think 30 minutes is a good show for you.
[29:14.010 --> 29:18.170]  Big shout out to everybody out there with attention deficit problems.
[29:18.170 --> 29:19.170]  I love you guys.
[29:19.170 --> 29:20.170]  I'm in your gang.
[29:20.170 --> 29:21.170]  Don't worry.
[29:21.170 --> 29:22.170]  That's all I've got for this episode.
[29:22.170 --> 29:26.010]  If you feel like this episode was educational, informative, or entertaining, maybe you learned
[29:26.010 --> 29:28.670]  a couple of things, maybe I improved your garden, maybe you'd just like to throw me
[29:28.670 --> 29:31.170]  a couple of bucks because I'm educational or entertaining.
[29:31.170 --> 29:32.770]  I think I said that already.
[29:32.770 --> 29:36.970]  Anyway, the Patreon is patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[29:36.970 --> 29:37.970]  Don't be shy.
[29:37.970 --> 29:43.970]  All the info you need is right there on the screen at patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[29:44.130 --> 29:47.570]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, I would love to hear from you.
[29:47.570 --> 29:50.890]  My email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[29:50.890 --> 29:51.890]  Don't be shy.
[29:51.890 --> 29:52.890]  Send me that feedback.
[29:52.890 --> 29:54.890]  Let me know what you're thinking about the show.
[29:54.890 --> 29:55.890]  I do appreciate it.
[29:55.890 --> 29:56.890]  I get a lot of emails.
[29:56.890 --> 29:57.890]  I get a lot of interaction.
[29:57.890 --> 30:01.170]  If I haven't answered you, don't feel like I'm ignoring you.
[30:01.170 --> 30:04.130]  There are 7,000 people subscribed to this podcast.
[30:04.130 --> 30:06.610]  Thank you for the 7,000 subscribers, by the way.
[30:06.610 --> 30:08.770]  There's only one of me, so I get a lot of messages.
[30:08.770 --> 30:09.770]  I get a lot of emails.
[30:09.770 --> 30:11.210]  I get a lot of comments.
[30:11.210 --> 30:16.010]  I do try to reply to all of them, but it's just me and my little fingers can only go
[30:16.010 --> 30:17.010]  so fast.
[30:17.010 --> 30:18.010]  Be patient with me.
[30:18.010 --> 30:19.010]  I'm not ignoring you.
[30:19.010 --> 30:20.010]  I don't hate you.
[30:20.010 --> 30:22.530]  I love each and every one of you like my own adopted pets.
[30:22.530 --> 30:23.650]  I will get to your messages.
[30:23.650 --> 30:24.650]  I do promise.
[30:24.650 --> 30:28.770]  My New Year's resolution was to be better at answering emails.
[30:28.770 --> 30:29.770]  I don't know.
[30:29.770 --> 30:31.370]  I don't know if I hit that goal or not.
[30:31.370 --> 30:34.330]  We're only halfway through the year here, so I got a lot of catching up to do.
[30:34.330 --> 30:35.530]  I feel like we can fix this.
[30:35.530 --> 30:36.530]  We can redeem that.
[30:36.530 --> 30:38.490]  You guys, I'm just rambling at this point.
[30:38.490 --> 30:39.490]  Thank you for hanging out.
[30:39.570 --> 30:41.570]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[30:41.570 --> 30:45.450]  I want to give a giant shout out to my friend Blackbird76.
[30:45.450 --> 30:48.450]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
