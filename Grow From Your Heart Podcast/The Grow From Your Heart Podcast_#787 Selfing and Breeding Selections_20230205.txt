[00:02.110 --> 00:22.560]  All right, here we go.
[00:22.560 --> 00:23.560]  I'm your host.
[00:23.560 --> 00:24.980]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:24.980 --> 00:29.440]  This is episode 787 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:29.440 --> 00:30.840]  I've got a fun episode planned.
[00:30.840 --> 00:32.440]  We're going to talk about breeding.
[00:32.440 --> 00:35.080]  Later in the episode, I will give away a pack of seeds.
[00:35.080 --> 00:36.560]  Let's jump right into the breeding talk.
[00:36.560 --> 00:39.860]  I do have a great email here that came from our friend Jason.
[00:39.860 --> 00:40.940]  Let's not waste too much time.
[00:40.940 --> 00:42.560]  The email goes a lot like this.
[00:42.560 --> 00:44.920]  It says, hey Rasta Jeff, my name is Jason.
[00:44.920 --> 00:46.460]  I'm from Northern Colorado.
[00:46.460 --> 00:47.460]  Nice to meet you, bro.
[00:47.460 --> 00:49.920]  It says, I really love the show and your hard work.
[00:49.920 --> 00:50.920]  Keep up the good fight.
[00:50.920 --> 00:53.020]  Bro, can't stop, won't stop.
[00:53.020 --> 00:54.020]  It goes on.
[00:54.020 --> 00:57.700]  It says, I'm a big fan here and I really rely on your information as far as breeding and
[00:57.700 --> 00:59.640]  selections go.
[00:59.640 --> 01:00.640]  Thank you.
[01:00.640 --> 01:01.640]  That's a huge compliment.
[01:01.640 --> 01:04.640]  Knowing that you rely on my breeding, you respect and trust my guidance.
[01:04.640 --> 01:05.640]  Thank you.
[01:05.640 --> 01:06.640]  That means a lot to me.
[01:06.640 --> 01:07.800]  So big up and fist bump and thanks for that.
[01:07.800 --> 01:08.800]  It does continue.
[01:08.800 --> 01:13.760]  It says, I'm currently about to start a breeding run, which I am super excited about, but I'm
[01:13.760 --> 01:18.260]  not sure how to select which female to select to spray and reverse.
[01:18.260 --> 01:21.460]  So our friend Jason has a breeding project in mind.
[01:21.460 --> 01:23.100]  They want to make some feminized seeds.
[01:23.100 --> 01:27.180]  They've got two plants, but they cannot decide which one of those two female plants they
[01:27.180 --> 01:29.780]  should reverse to turn into a pollen donor.
[01:29.780 --> 01:30.780]  Let's dig more into this.
[01:30.780 --> 01:37.060]  It says, I have plant A that checks all of the boxes to what we like, but it lacks turps,
[01:37.060 --> 01:38.060]  but it is highly potent.
[01:38.060 --> 01:40.780]  So we've got a plant that checks all of the boxes.
[01:40.780 --> 01:42.060]  It is a perfect breeding plant.
[01:42.060 --> 01:45.880]  It's a perfect female, except for the fact that it lacks turps.
[01:45.880 --> 01:49.820]  However, this plant is highly potent, which kind of sometimes may make up for that lack
[01:49.820 --> 01:50.820]  of turps.
[01:50.820 --> 01:55.180]  We've got a highly potent plant that checks all of the boxes, but it lacks terpene.
[01:55.180 --> 01:56.180]  So then it goes on.
[01:56.180 --> 02:02.240]  It says plant B is not as potent, but has a sweet grapefruit kush flavor that is dino
[02:02.240 --> 02:03.240]  mite.
[02:03.240 --> 02:04.560]  So this plant isn't as potent.
[02:04.560 --> 02:08.000]  It lacks the potency, but it's got that flavor that they are looking for.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.380]  It says a sweet grapefruit kush flavor, which sounds quite delightful in my opinion, that
[02:12.380 --> 02:18.260]  a stringent, a bitter, almost citrusy grapefruit with some kush on top of it to mellow it out.
[02:18.260 --> 02:20.060]  It sounds like a great flavor in my mind.
[02:20.060 --> 02:22.820]  That makes me think it's going to have a great buzz as well.
[02:22.820 --> 02:23.960]  So that sounds like a great idea.
[02:23.960 --> 02:25.540]  We've got the flavor there.
[02:25.540 --> 02:27.300]  We've got the aroma there and it's dino mite.
[02:27.300 --> 02:32.580]  It says this plant just doesn't get me as medicated properly like plant A does.
[02:32.580 --> 02:36.780]  I want to breed with the purpose and add those turps to the potent plant.
[02:36.780 --> 02:41.700]  So which plant would be the best to spray with the STS and use the feminized pollen
[02:41.700 --> 02:42.700]  from?
[02:42.700 --> 02:43.700]  Which is a very good question.
[02:43.700 --> 02:45.400]  I've got a couple of solid answers for you.
[02:45.400 --> 02:49.920]  It says, I'm not sure if I use the terpe plant as a pollen donor since it's what I'm after
[02:49.920 --> 02:50.920]  essentially.
[02:50.920 --> 02:51.920]  Please elaborate.
[02:51.920 --> 02:52.920]  I hope this makes sense.
[02:52.920 --> 02:53.920]  It makes great sense, brother.
[02:53.920 --> 02:55.080]  This makes a lot of good sense.
[02:55.080 --> 02:56.960]  It says, thank you for your reply.
[02:56.960 --> 02:58.360]  It would be appreciated.
[02:58.360 --> 03:02.280]  Much love from your neighbors up north and you can use my name on the show if this makes
[03:02.280 --> 03:03.280]  it.
[03:03.280 --> 03:05.720]  I'm glad you included that because I started this whole thing by saying this came from
[03:05.720 --> 03:06.720]  our friend Jason.
[03:06.720 --> 03:08.340]  Big up to my friend Jason.
[03:08.340 --> 03:09.500]  This is a great question.
[03:09.500 --> 03:13.900]  So you've got two plants and you can't decide which one to use as the pollen donor.
[03:13.900 --> 03:16.700]  I've got some great advice.
[03:16.700 --> 03:21.020]  I don't only do my selections based on flavors, aroma, potency.
[03:21.020 --> 03:23.620]  There are a lot of other things that I think about.
[03:23.620 --> 03:28.220]  Let's look at both of these plants and think which plant has got the structure and shape
[03:28.220 --> 03:30.960]  you are after in your progeny.
[03:30.960 --> 03:35.700]  Think about how far apart the nodes are, the node spacing is, the branch spacing, how much
[03:35.700 --> 03:37.300]  branching does the plant make?
[03:37.300 --> 03:38.920]  How is the plant overall shaped?
[03:38.920 --> 03:43.400]  Do you have a real tall, skinny, wispy plant or do you have a short squat, bushy, wide
[03:43.400 --> 03:44.400]  plant?
[03:44.400 --> 03:46.440]  What do you want your plants in the future to be shaped like?
[03:46.440 --> 03:50.920]  That is a very important factor to consider when it does come to selecting your plants.
[03:50.920 --> 03:55.360]  Also leaf size and shape definitely make a big difference in that plant.
[03:55.360 --> 03:56.760]  Do you want a long skinny leaf?
[03:56.760 --> 03:58.540]  Do you want a big fat broad leaf?
[03:58.540 --> 04:00.040]  Do you want somewhere in the middle?
[04:00.040 --> 04:01.540]  That's something to pay attention to.
[04:01.540 --> 04:05.600]  Also when it comes to breeding, think about the flowering time of the selected plants
[04:05.600 --> 04:06.660]  you are going to use.
[04:06.660 --> 04:10.500]  That flowering time is going to translate heavily into your breeding project.
[04:10.500 --> 04:13.220]  So do you have one that flowers at a more appropriate time?
[04:13.220 --> 04:17.420]  If one of those plants flowers longer and one flowers more quickly, that trait will
[04:17.420 --> 04:20.180]  pass if you use that plant in the breeding project.
[04:20.180 --> 04:23.860]  Most likely the male is going to heavily contribute to that flowering time.
[04:23.860 --> 04:27.620]  So keep that in mind or the reversed male will say pollen donor from here out.
[04:27.620 --> 04:29.660]  I'll try to remember to say pollen donor from here out.
[04:29.660 --> 04:31.140]  I make no promises.
[04:31.140 --> 04:34.740]  So also do these plants handle stress?
[04:34.840 --> 04:36.040]  Does it handle grower stress?
[04:36.040 --> 04:38.520]  By grower stress I mean can you top it?
[04:38.520 --> 04:39.520]  Can you pop it?
[04:39.520 --> 04:40.520]  Can you lollipop it?
[04:40.520 --> 04:41.520]  Can you twist it?
[04:41.520 --> 04:42.800]  Can you defoliate it?
[04:42.800 --> 04:44.400]  Can you make mistakes with it?
[04:44.400 --> 04:45.400]  Can you abuse it?
[04:45.400 --> 04:46.400]  Can you beat it up?
[04:46.400 --> 04:47.400]  Can you overwater it?
[04:47.400 --> 04:48.400]  Can you underwater it?
[04:48.400 --> 04:50.080]  Can it handle environmental stress?
[04:50.080 --> 04:52.000]  That's kind of over water, underwater.
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.160]  But also how about vapor pressure deficit issues, humidity spikes, humidity drops, temperature
[04:57.160 --> 04:59.960]  spikes, temperature drops, diurnal swings.
[04:59.960 --> 05:02.160]  Can these plants handle those sort of things?
[05:02.180 --> 05:06.460]  The one that handles the stress the best is the one that I would use as the pollen donor
[05:06.460 --> 05:09.020]  in my opinion and in my experience.
[05:09.020 --> 05:13.260]  Now you asked specifically which plant I would recommend to use here.
[05:13.260 --> 05:17.460]  This is my opinion, my advice, and I will explain why I would do this.
[05:17.460 --> 05:19.020]  I've got a solid reason for it.
[05:19.020 --> 05:25.940]  I would choose the potent plant as the pollen donor and allow that one to pollinate multiple
[05:25.940 --> 05:26.940]  females.
[05:26.940 --> 05:29.980]  It looks like you've got one female plant that you want to pollinate, but I would pollinate
[05:29.980 --> 05:31.060]  multiple females.
[05:31.080 --> 05:36.240]  The reason for that is when you pollinate one female, you kind of see what the plant
[05:36.240 --> 05:40.480]  A and plant B, you can see what that brought to the table and what they made.
[05:40.480 --> 05:46.280]  But if you put plant A to plant B, C, and D, put that pollen on multiple females, we
[05:46.280 --> 05:49.240]  can really see what the boy is adding to the mix.
[05:49.240 --> 05:52.720]  Because if you've got a female plant that makes blueberry turps, a female plant that
[05:52.720 --> 05:56.040]  makes chocolate turps, and a female plant that makes banana turps, and then you add
[05:56.040 --> 05:59.000]  gas to it, did you get ... I forgot the flavors already.
[05:59.020 --> 06:03.580]  Did you get gassy blueberries, gassy whatever else I said, and glassy bananas?
[06:03.580 --> 06:05.780]  Or is it all bananas, all gas?
[06:05.780 --> 06:09.220]  See what that male is adding to the mix in there and see what it's contributing.
[06:09.220 --> 06:13.740]  If you just make one cross, you only know how that male interacts with that one female.
[06:13.740 --> 06:18.260]  If you cross it to multiple females, we can see how that male expresses itself on a wider
[06:18.260 --> 06:20.460]  palette through more population.
[06:20.460 --> 06:24.700]  In my experience, in my opinion, that's really helpful for selecting breeding projects, for
[06:24.700 --> 06:27.280]  selecting breeding males, breeding pairs.
[06:27.280 --> 06:28.560]  That really goes a long way.
[06:28.620 --> 06:33.700]  In my opinion, in my experience, I know you're focused on making the grapefruit, cush, and
[06:33.700 --> 06:37.740]  the turpy plant together, or the potent plant and the turpy plant together, but also why
[06:37.740 --> 06:38.740]  not?
[06:38.740 --> 06:41.820]  If you're going to reverse one plant, why not put a couple of females in there, multiple
[06:41.820 --> 06:46.580]  females in the room with that male to make multiple crosses, a lot of seeds to play with.
[06:46.580 --> 06:47.580]  That's just more fun to me.
[06:47.580 --> 06:51.460]  Also, that way, like I said, you get to really see what that male plant is bringing to the
[06:51.460 --> 06:52.460]  mix.
[06:52.460 --> 06:57.020]  If you just add, let's just say, chocolate and vanilla together, we know what chocolate
[06:57.020 --> 07:00.080]  and vanilla tastes like, but what if I put chocolate and strawberry?
[07:00.080 --> 07:01.760]  Does the chocolate dominate the mix?
[07:01.760 --> 07:05.520]  Does the strawberry dominate the mix, or do I get a nice chocolate-strawberry mix?
[07:05.520 --> 07:08.440]  Let's see what happens in there and see what the plants do that way.
[07:08.440 --> 07:12.680]  I would start by using the potent plant as my pollen donor.
[07:12.680 --> 07:16.160]  Then what would happen, in my opinion, what I think would happen, and I'm kind of doing
[07:16.160 --> 07:17.160]  this.
[07:17.160 --> 07:20.960]  I used, when I made the ninja turtle line, I'm not sure if you've been following for
[07:20.960 --> 07:24.160]  that long, I took a reversed blueberry cookies plant.
[07:24.300 --> 07:26.500]  That blueberry cookies plant was amazing.
[07:26.500 --> 07:31.180]  I pollinated a bunch of other female plants with that plant, and I named them after the
[07:31.180 --> 07:32.580]  ninja turtles.
[07:32.580 --> 07:37.980]  What I noticed is the blueberry cookies showed itself very well in all of the other crosses,
[07:37.980 --> 07:42.020]  but it also blended very well to a lot of those crosses.
[07:42.020 --> 07:46.420]  What ended up happening was that potency from the reversed blueberry cookies, the potency,
[07:46.420 --> 07:50.940]  the vigor, the plant shape, all the good traits from that passed on to the offspring into
[07:50.940 --> 07:52.500]  the breeding project.
[07:52.960 --> 07:56.000]  I said ninja turtles line, we'll use Raphael as a good example here.
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.120]  That is a reversed blueberry cookies pollinated a strawberry fields plant, makes Raphael.
[08:01.120 --> 08:05.120]  When I bred those two together, I could really see the strawberry starburst or the strawberry
[08:05.120 --> 08:06.120]  fields traits.
[08:06.120 --> 08:07.600]  I could smell it, I could taste it.
[08:07.600 --> 08:11.960]  Then also it had the vigor, the potency, and some of the aroma and flavor of the blueberry
[08:11.960 --> 08:12.960]  cookies.
[08:12.960 --> 08:17.320]  I was able to get that potency, the vigor, the plant shape, all that good stuff into
[08:17.320 --> 08:21.480]  that other end of the offspring, and it also brought a lot of that strawberry flavor.
[08:21.480 --> 08:25.260]  Let's talk about another one in the mix was I pollinated the platinum tangy and that made
[08:25.260 --> 08:26.260]  Michelangelo.
[08:26.260 --> 08:30.500]  Again, I got that growth structure, the shape, the vigor from the blueberry cookies, but
[08:30.500 --> 08:35.300]  I also got that platinum tangy aroma and flavor mixed in with the blueberry cookies.
[08:35.300 --> 08:40.820]  My idea, my goal, what actually ended up happening, what I'm recommending to you is use that potency,
[08:40.820 --> 08:45.460]  rely on the potency from that reversed male, then let the females you're using change up
[08:45.460 --> 08:47.180]  the palate throughout each plant.
[08:47.180 --> 08:49.780]  Maybe you got a strawberry, an orange, a lemon.
[08:49.780 --> 08:50.780]  What else did I use?
[08:51.080 --> 08:53.280]  I used a bunch of different things in that mix, but there's definitely strawberry, orange,
[08:53.280 --> 08:54.880]  lemon, and blueberry in there.
[08:54.880 --> 08:59.360]  I brought all of those out and mixed that with the original blueberry cookies cross.
[08:59.360 --> 09:03.680]  If this were me, if this was my breeding project, if I was in charge of this room, I would select
[09:03.680 --> 09:06.680]  the more potent plant, the plant with the more potency.
[09:06.680 --> 09:09.880]  Also don't forget about vigor, plant structure, resistance.
[09:09.880 --> 09:11.800]  Are these plants resistant to bugs, pathogens?
[09:11.800 --> 09:13.160]  Do they get problems?
[09:13.160 --> 09:17.320]  I would find the best plant with the best potency, the best vigor, best resistance.
[09:17.320 --> 09:18.900]  That would be my pollen donor.
[09:18.900 --> 09:24.320]  And then I would rely on all those female plants to be my terp provider, my flavor,
[09:24.320 --> 09:28.420]  my differences, because that male is going to mix well with a lot of things if you select
[09:28.420 --> 09:33.760]  the proper, I said male once again, but that reversed female, that pollen donor plant.
[09:33.760 --> 09:37.000]  So once you've done the pollination, once you've made seeds, the next step to do is
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.880]  to grow these seeds out.
[09:38.880 --> 09:43.240]  If you only pollinated that one plant, grow as many of those seeds as you possibly can.
[09:43.240 --> 09:45.160]  See if you've created what you're looking for.
[09:45.160 --> 09:49.080]  Did you find the terpy plant with the potency, the vigor, the shape, the structure you're
[09:49.080 --> 09:50.080]  looking for?
[09:50.080 --> 09:51.080]  Is it in there?
[09:51.080 --> 09:53.120]  If so, then you've done exactly what you're looking for.
[09:53.120 --> 09:54.640]  You've reached your breeding goal.
[09:54.640 --> 09:58.320]  I would take that plant and I would find something else to do with it to further breed it.
[09:58.320 --> 10:02.020]  Maybe self that plant, maybe breed that to other things, but that would be my new keeper
[10:02.020 --> 10:04.640]  to start my new breeding project with.
[10:04.640 --> 10:08.880]  If you bred this to multiple females, grow out a bunch of those female seeds or seeds
[10:08.880 --> 10:11.400]  from those other plants and see what you've created.
[10:11.400 --> 10:15.840]  See what that male plant is contributing to that mix amongst that population of females.
[10:15.840 --> 10:17.040]  That's so much fun.
[10:17.040 --> 10:20.800]  That's my favorite part, taking a reverse plant or a male plant, pollinating a bunch
[10:20.800 --> 10:25.660]  of girls, not just growing out this batch and this batch, but growing out all of them
[10:25.660 --> 10:28.360]  and seeing like, oh, the guy does this.
[10:28.360 --> 10:32.720]  The guy made all of these plants get a chocolate aroma, but also they also added their own,
[10:32.720 --> 10:36.880]  but also some of the plants got like this weird leaf shape that came from the guy plant.
[10:36.880 --> 10:39.400]  You'll notice what does cross and what doesn't cross.
[10:40.160 --> 10:43.880]  You'll figure out what's a recessive trait, what's a dominant, a co-dominant trait.
[10:43.880 --> 10:47.400]  You'll just learn a lot about your plants by breeding them to other things.
[10:47.400 --> 10:51.960]  Now I said originally that what I would do is take the most potent plant and that would
[10:51.960 --> 10:53.840]  be my candidate for reversal.
[10:53.840 --> 10:57.400]  Now you're really going to be blown away by the next thing that I say.
[10:57.400 --> 11:01.200]  After you've done this cross, after you've taken your candidate that you have reversed
[11:01.200 --> 11:05.920]  and you've pollinated, you've grown it, you found some seeds, found out what you produced,
[11:05.920 --> 11:06.920]  found the keeper out of there.
[11:06.920 --> 11:08.960]  Now guess what your next project is.
[11:08.960 --> 11:10.120]  Do the opposite.
[11:10.120 --> 11:14.680]  Take that terpy one, reverse it, pollinate the potent plant, then grow it out again.
[11:14.680 --> 11:18.740]  If you've got the opportunity, like I mentioned before, grow out, pollinate multiple females
[11:18.740 --> 11:19.740]  with this reversal.
[11:19.740 --> 11:24.280]  Again, if you can, pollinate the same females that you did the opposite plant with and let's
[11:24.280 --> 11:27.480]  see what this plant is contributing to the mix.
[11:27.480 --> 11:33.000]  Now we get to see what plant A does when it's reversed and pollinates multiple females and
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.080]  we can see what traits deliver there.
[11:35.080 --> 11:39.400]  Then we'll reverse plant B and pollinate multiple females and see what traits come
[11:39.400 --> 11:40.400]  up there.
[11:40.400 --> 11:44.320]  Then we can even see what the male is delivering because now we can really see what the female
[11:44.320 --> 11:48.880]  is contributing to the cross because we've pollinated it with two different sets of pollen.
[11:48.880 --> 11:50.760]  I know that's a lot to get into.
[11:50.760 --> 11:51.760]  That's really deep.
[11:51.760 --> 11:53.240]  That's really in-depth.
[11:53.240 --> 11:55.120]  That's in the mind of a breeder, honestly.
[11:55.120 --> 11:58.040]  Once I make a cross, once I reverse something, that's what I want to do.
[11:58.040 --> 12:01.480]  I want to reverse the other one that I didn't choose and reverse that and then pollinate
[12:01.480 --> 12:05.040]  everything and then grow both batches side by side and see what I've created.
[12:05.040 --> 12:07.880]  It becomes really crazy, but it is a lot of fun.
[12:07.880 --> 12:08.880]  It's a lot of passion.
[12:08.880 --> 12:12.360]  Once you start this, this could be a lifetime project.
[12:12.360 --> 12:13.720]  Don't ever rush a breeding project.
[12:13.720 --> 12:15.360]  Take your time.
[12:15.360 --> 12:16.480]  Do the pollination.
[12:16.480 --> 12:17.600]  Let the seeds finish.
[12:17.600 --> 12:20.240]  Grow out the population and find the plant that you are looking for.
[12:20.240 --> 12:23.880]  If the plant that you're looking for is not in there, do it the opposite way.
[12:23.880 --> 12:25.440]  Pick different parents.
[12:25.440 --> 12:26.600]  Never be discouraged with breeding.
[12:26.600 --> 12:27.960]  You'll always find something great.
[12:27.960 --> 12:31.200]  However, the goal here is to improve upon these lines.
[12:31.520 --> 12:34.360]  If your cross doesn't come out ... I don't know your plants.
[12:34.360 --> 12:37.800]  I don't want to judge you, but if these plants are both sevens, the goal is to come out with
[12:37.800 --> 12:41.880]  a plant that is at least an eight, maybe a nine, hopefully a 10 if you can do it.
[12:41.880 --> 12:45.880]  If you haven't improved upon the species of cannabis, then that is your responsibility
[12:45.880 --> 12:47.680]  to decide what to do with those seeds.
[12:47.680 --> 12:50.720]  If they're not amazing, maybe don't pass them out to the whole world.
[12:50.720 --> 12:52.000]  Don't share them with a bunch of people.
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.480]  Maybe keep them to yourself.
[12:53.480 --> 12:56.280]  If those are stellar, make sure you do share those seeds with people.
[12:56.280 --> 13:00.160]  Get those out so that more people can grow high quality ganja.
[13:00.320 --> 13:04.040]  All right, Jason Johnson, I really feel like you got me rambling pretty good on that one.
[13:04.040 --> 13:06.280]  I hope I answered your question.
[13:06.280 --> 13:07.840]  Don't just focus on the potency.
[13:07.840 --> 13:10.900]  Don't just focus on those aromas and flavors.
[13:10.900 --> 13:13.040]  Also focus on resistance.
[13:13.040 --> 13:14.240]  How does it handle problems?
[13:14.240 --> 13:17.000]  How does it handle grower stress, environmental stress?
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.760]  Think about all that other stuff as well, but then I would recommend choosing the plant
[13:20.760 --> 13:23.720]  with the potency and pollinating those terpy females.
[13:23.720 --> 13:26.000]  All right, brother, thank you for the great question.
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.960]  If anybody else out there has any questions, you know that I would love to help you out.
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.680]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[13:32.680 --> 13:33.680]  Don't be shy.
[13:33.680 --> 13:34.680]  Send me those grow questions.
[13:34.680 --> 13:38.400]  I do have one more question we're going to bang out here on this episode.
[13:38.400 --> 13:40.360]  Then we will get to the seed giveaway.
[13:40.360 --> 13:45.000]  That's right, our friends at seedsherenow.com are going to give away a free pack of iRegenetic
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.880]  seeds here on this podcast.
[13:46.880 --> 13:47.880]  Stay tuned.
[13:47.880 --> 13:50.760]  It is almost time to tell you how to win those seeds.
[13:50.760 --> 13:52.160]  Let's jump into this next email.
[13:52.160 --> 13:54.560]  This one came from our friend SomethingDifferent.
[13:54.560 --> 13:56.200]  Shout out to our friend SomethingDifferent.
[13:56.200 --> 13:57.200]  Thank you for the great question.
[13:58.200 --> 13:59.600]  What's going on, Rasta Jeff?
[13:59.600 --> 14:01.600]  I hope your new year is off to a great start.
[14:01.600 --> 14:03.160]  Bro, things are killing it.
[14:03.160 --> 14:04.360]  January was awesome.
[14:04.360 --> 14:06.640]  February has begun very well.
[14:06.640 --> 14:07.640]  Nothing to complain about.
[14:07.640 --> 14:09.720]  Hope everything is going great for you as well.
[14:09.720 --> 14:11.840]  It says, I have two questions.
[14:11.840 --> 14:15.680]  Question number one, I was under the impression that if you self a plant, it is a complete
[14:15.680 --> 14:20.520]  copy of the mom used, but I was recently told that this is not exactly the case.
[14:20.520 --> 14:22.240]  Can you elaborate on that?
[14:22.240 --> 14:24.160]  That's the part one of the question.
[14:24.160 --> 14:29.440]  And I also remember saying something a while ago about an auto flower collab.
[14:29.440 --> 14:31.440]  Is there any movement or updates on that?
[14:31.440 --> 14:33.920]  Also the fam and I are planning, I'm not going to read this part.
[14:33.920 --> 14:35.520]  They're moving near me and we're going to hang out.
[14:35.520 --> 14:38.280]  So I'm not going to read where you're moving to because the whole world doesn't need to
[14:38.280 --> 14:39.280]  know that.
[14:39.280 --> 14:40.280]  But yes, we will hang out.
[14:40.280 --> 14:41.280]  We will take dabs.
[14:41.280 --> 14:42.760]  I look forward to that.
[14:42.760 --> 14:44.600]  Let's address the second question first.
[14:44.600 --> 14:45.720]  Let's do it backwards.
[14:45.720 --> 14:48.240]  The auto flower collab.
[14:48.240 --> 14:50.320]  Daz with night owl seeds.
[14:50.320 --> 14:51.840]  I'm not sure what he's calling himself this week.
[14:51.840 --> 14:54.120]  Daz, you change your name a lot, but I try to keep up with you.
[14:54.120 --> 14:56.680]  Nothing but love and respect and congrats also.
[14:56.680 --> 15:01.800]  Daz is working some auto flower stuff with some iri genetic stuff in there.
[15:01.800 --> 15:07.640]  I don't have a solid info on exactly how far Daz has gotten into that, but I know the project
[15:07.640 --> 15:08.760]  is making great success.
[15:08.760 --> 15:10.600]  I've ran some of the F ones.
[15:10.600 --> 15:12.200]  I've looked at pictures.
[15:12.200 --> 15:14.280]  I'm not exactly sure how far he's gotten with that.
[15:14.280 --> 15:15.280]  I haven't kept in touch.
[15:15.280 --> 15:20.520]  I haven't asked, but Daz is working on that feminized auto flower project with the iri
[15:20.520 --> 15:22.180]  genetic strains in there.
[15:22.180 --> 15:23.760]  So I would make sure to check with a night.
[15:24.400 --> 15:25.400]  Check with Daz.
[15:25.400 --> 15:26.400]  See what he's going on.
[15:26.400 --> 15:29.840]  He's probably got a lot more info and updates on that.
[15:29.840 --> 15:31.360]  Those will be available through night owl.
[15:31.360 --> 15:33.040]  I won't even have those seeds.
[15:33.040 --> 15:34.040]  That's all his project.
[15:34.040 --> 15:36.320]  He's got my blessing, but I'm not into auto flowers.
[15:36.320 --> 15:39.080]  If I made auto flowers, it wouldn't be very good.
[15:39.080 --> 15:43.240]  I say it's like I can play any kind of music you want, but if you put me in a country band,
[15:43.240 --> 15:46.680]  I can play country music, but it's not going to feel like country music.
[15:46.680 --> 15:49.920]  It's not going to have whatever country he's got that makes it feel country.
[15:49.920 --> 15:51.800]  It's going to be missing a little something.
[15:51.920 --> 15:55.200]  It just ain't going to have that feel that a real country drummer could put to it.
[15:55.200 --> 15:56.640]  So that's why I don't make autos.
[15:56.640 --> 15:57.640]  They're not for me.
[15:57.640 --> 16:00.260]  All right, let's answer the first part of this email.
[16:00.260 --> 16:01.640]  This is a very good question.
[16:01.640 --> 16:06.360]  It says, I was under the impression that if you self a plant, it becomes a complete, the
[16:06.360 --> 16:08.720]  seed should be a complete copy of the mom.
[16:08.720 --> 16:09.720]  That is a good question.
[16:09.720 --> 16:11.200]  Let's take a little drink here and then we'll answer that.
[16:11.200 --> 16:12.200]  Not even going to edit this part.
[16:12.200 --> 16:14.320]  I'm just going to take a little drink, keep moving.
[16:14.320 --> 16:17.960]  Shout out to the kombucha gods for keeping me kombucha-lated.
[16:17.960 --> 16:18.960]  Is that a word?
[16:18.960 --> 16:19.960]  That's a new word.
[16:19.960 --> 16:21.680]  It's an urban dictionary.
[16:21.680 --> 16:22.680]  Kombucha-lated.
[16:22.680 --> 16:25.960]  That is when you're well hydrated and have good microbes from drinking plenty of high
[16:25.960 --> 16:27.440]  quality kombucha.
[16:27.440 --> 16:28.440]  Rasta Jeff made that up.
[16:28.440 --> 16:29.840]  I want fucking credit for it.
[16:29.840 --> 16:30.840]  Kombucha-lated.
[16:30.840 --> 16:33.760]  I'm going to quit rambling and take a drink.
[16:33.760 --> 16:36.000]  Okay, maybe I cut out a couple of seconds.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  Maybe I didn't.
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.240]  Let's answer this question about reversing a plant.
[16:39.240 --> 16:41.480]  When you self a plant, what does that mean?
[16:41.480 --> 16:45.240]  We talked a moment ago about selecting plants for feminized breeding.
[16:45.240 --> 16:48.680]  Selfing a plant is when you take two clones of the same plant.
[16:48.840 --> 16:50.440]  Let's just start with a golden goat plant.
[16:50.440 --> 16:53.120]  I'm going to cut two clones off of a golden goat plant.
[16:53.120 --> 16:54.600]  I'm going to let them grow.
[16:54.600 --> 16:56.480]  We're going to flower them.
[16:56.480 --> 16:59.600]  Before I flower them, I'm going to treat one with a solution.
[16:59.600 --> 17:01.680]  We don't need to talk too much about that solution.
[17:01.680 --> 17:03.240]  I'm going to spray it.
[17:03.240 --> 17:04.600]  I'm going to spray it several times.
[17:04.600 --> 17:05.600]  I've got a schedule.
[17:05.600 --> 17:06.600]  I've got a program.
[17:06.600 --> 17:08.400]  There's a standard operating procedure.
[17:08.400 --> 17:10.960]  Eventually, this plant is going to produce pollen.
[17:10.960 --> 17:15.160]  The pollen that comes from this plant is only female pollen because the golden goat plant
[17:15.160 --> 17:19.120]  that I started with does not contain any male chromosomes.
[17:19.120 --> 17:21.680]  This plant is going to go sort of into a panic mode.
[17:21.680 --> 17:23.360]  It's going to create pollen sacs.
[17:23.360 --> 17:26.560]  Those pollen sacs will only contain female pollen.
[17:26.560 --> 17:31.640]  Then I will take that female pollen from the golden goat and put it on another female golden
[17:31.640 --> 17:33.080]  goat plant.
[17:33.080 --> 17:34.660]  This is known as selfing.
[17:34.660 --> 17:35.660]  This is called selfing.
[17:35.660 --> 17:37.160]  I have S1'd this plant.
[17:37.160 --> 17:40.360]  It is a first generation of a selfed plant.
[17:40.360 --> 17:44.080]  I took the golden goat and the golden goat and I selfed them.
[17:44.080 --> 17:47.520]  I call it self because it's a self pollination.
[17:47.520 --> 17:52.520]  There is no other, there are no other genetics adulterating this mix, but now I can make
[17:52.520 --> 17:54.640]  pure golden goat seeds.
[17:54.640 --> 17:58.080]  Those will be feminized golden goat S1 seeds.
[17:58.080 --> 18:01.680]  Now the question that arises has a rose has been brought up that was asked.
[18:01.680 --> 18:03.000]  I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.880]  The question here is I was under the impression that they would be a complete copy of the
[18:06.880 --> 18:07.880]  mom.
[18:07.880 --> 18:12.440]  Approximately 50 to 70% of the phenotypes that come from those seeds will look just
[18:12.440 --> 18:15.020]  like the original golden goat mother.
[18:15.020 --> 18:19.180]  But some of those plants are going to look a little bit like the mother plan that was
[18:19.180 --> 18:23.120]  used to make golden goat and some will look a little bit like the father plant that was
[18:23.120 --> 18:24.900]  used to make the golden goat.
[18:24.900 --> 18:29.200]  I'm going to say 50 to 60, maybe 70% of those are going to be right down the middle.
[18:29.200 --> 18:32.780]  They're going to look just like that original golden goat, but you're going to have some
[18:32.780 --> 18:36.760]  on this side that look a little bit like the mom plant that made golden goat and some on
[18:36.760 --> 18:40.120]  this side that look a little bit like the dad plant that made golden goat.
[18:40.120 --> 18:44.640]  We may also see phenotypes that express traits of the grandparents of the original golden
[18:44.640 --> 18:45.640]  goat.
[18:45.640 --> 18:50.080]  So we may see traits of the mom and then also traits of the mom's parents and traits of
[18:50.080 --> 18:53.220]  the dad and also traits of the dad's parents.
[18:53.220 --> 18:57.320]  The only way to really identify that is to be familiar with the parents and grandparents
[18:57.320 --> 18:58.520]  of that plant.
[18:58.520 --> 19:02.000]  But when I grow it out, I can identify it because I know what used, I know all of the
[19:02.000 --> 19:03.000]  ingredients.
[19:03.000 --> 19:04.000]  So I could taste that.
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.560]  I could say, oh, there's the cinnamon, there's the butter, there's the maple syrup.
[19:06.560 --> 19:11.240]  I can identify every ingredient by looking at it because I'm so familiar with each parent
[19:11.240 --> 19:12.240]  plant.
[19:12.240 --> 19:16.720]  So when you make those reversals, most of the time, about 50% of them, and I say most
[19:16.720 --> 19:21.200]  of the time because these are genetics, this depends very much on the plant that you are
[19:21.200 --> 19:22.200]  working with.
[19:22.200 --> 19:24.040]  Some plants reverse very well.
[19:24.040 --> 19:26.160]  Some plants don't reverse well at all.
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.720]  Some plants, when you reverse them, they make a bunch of intersex problems.
[19:29.720 --> 19:33.640]  Some plants, when you reverse them, they make a bunch of amazing gold like the golden goat.
[19:33.640 --> 19:35.560]  It makes a whole bunch of amazingness.
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.520]  Some plants, a lot of chem cultivars, a lot of the sour diesel stuff, if you reverse that,
[19:40.520 --> 19:42.720]  it just makes intersex garbage.
[19:42.720 --> 19:47.360]  So in my experience, when I self a plant, I generally get about 50% of the phenotypes.
[19:47.360 --> 19:49.280]  They look just like the original mom.
[19:49.280 --> 19:52.720]  And then I've got that group that looks a little bit like grandma, the group that looks
[19:52.720 --> 19:53.720]  a little bit like grandpa.
[19:53.720 --> 19:58.400]  And then we've got those outliers that look a little bit like the great grandparents.
[19:58.400 --> 20:00.960]  Now let's talk about something else really quickly.
[20:00.960 --> 20:04.920]  Not all feminized seeds are what are known as selfed seeds.
[20:04.960 --> 20:08.800]  A lot of feminized seeds are also known as reversals.
[20:08.800 --> 20:12.920]  A moment ago, I talk about taking two clones of the same golden goat plant.
[20:12.920 --> 20:14.400]  We reverse the golden goat.
[20:14.400 --> 20:16.440]  We put that pollen on golden goat.
[20:16.440 --> 20:17.720]  We have selfed that plant.
[20:17.720 --> 20:18.800]  It did it to itself.
[20:18.800 --> 20:20.240]  It got itself pregnant.
[20:20.240 --> 20:21.680]  It gave itself a selfie.
[20:21.680 --> 20:22.680]  You'll never forget that.
[20:22.680 --> 20:23.680]  That plant is selfed.
[20:23.680 --> 20:25.200]  That's an S1.
[20:25.200 --> 20:28.360]  What if I put that golden goat pollen on something different?
[20:28.360 --> 20:32.920]  What if I put that golden goat pollen on a GMO plant and I make something we call garlic
[20:32.920 --> 20:33.920]  goat?
[20:33.920 --> 20:36.840]  That plant is no longer selfing because I didn't pollinate itself.
[20:36.840 --> 20:40.320]  I pollinated another plant with reversed pollen.
[20:40.320 --> 20:43.640]  So instead of being an S1, that plant would be labeled an R1.
[20:43.640 --> 20:47.640]  It is a first filial generation of a reversed cross.
[20:47.640 --> 20:50.820]  So sometimes you're going to see plants that say S1.
[20:50.820 --> 20:52.600]  Sometimes it may say R1.
[20:52.600 --> 20:55.220]  Sometimes it may not give you any indication at all.
[20:55.220 --> 20:59.680]  If it is a golden goat feminized seed and you know that it's a clone only, that is most
[20:59.680 --> 21:03.720]  likely the original plant reversed and selfed onto itself.
[21:04.520 --> 21:08.080]  What if it is something like, let's talk about, like I just said a moment ago, the garlic
[21:08.080 --> 21:15.280]  goat that is a golden goat to the GMO that is a reversal that is going to show us phenotypes
[21:15.280 --> 21:18.720]  that look like the 50-50 mix, probably close to 50-50.
[21:18.720 --> 21:20.480]  It's going to be pretty close to 50-50.
[21:20.480 --> 21:24.420]  You'll find some that look just like golden goat, just like the GMO combined.
[21:24.420 --> 21:26.080]  We're going to see that phenotype.
[21:26.080 --> 21:29.080]  Then we're going to see phenotypes that look a little bit like GMO.
[21:29.080 --> 21:32.060]  Then we're going to see phenotypes that look a little bit like golden goat.
[21:32.100 --> 21:34.100]  Then guess what we're also going to see?
[21:34.100 --> 21:37.980]  Some phenotypes, a very small percentage of the phenotypes are going to look like golden
[21:37.980 --> 21:38.980]  goat's parents.
[21:38.980 --> 21:41.980]  Some of the phenotypes will look like the GMO parents.
[21:41.980 --> 21:45.500]  Then you're going to have a couple of phenotypes that you can't tell what the hell is going
[21:45.500 --> 21:46.500]  on.
[21:46.500 --> 21:47.500]  It's just got traits from everybody.
[21:47.500 --> 21:48.780]  It looks like the mailman's kid.
[21:48.780 --> 21:52.620]  That does happen a little bit when you start doing the reversals.
[21:52.620 --> 21:55.740]  That's the basic difference between selfing and reversing.
[21:55.740 --> 22:00.340]  Those are the basic phenotypes and traits that I think you are going to find with those feminized
[22:00.340 --> 22:01.340]  seeds.
[22:02.220 --> 22:04.740]  Most of your phenotypes are going to look like the original mom.
[22:04.740 --> 22:07.700]  We'll find some grandparents and a little bit of great grandparents.
[22:07.700 --> 22:11.820]  With the reversals that are not pure self, you're going to see the 50-50 phenotype that
[22:11.820 --> 22:13.140]  looks like mom and dad.
[22:13.140 --> 22:16.380]  You're going to find some that look like mom, some that look like dad, some that look like
[22:16.380 --> 22:17.380]  grandparents.
[22:17.380 --> 22:21.140]  Then you're going to find some weirdos that looks like weird mixes of each trait.
[22:21.140 --> 22:26.140]  You just took all the traits that were available from both plants, the leaf shape, the structure,
[22:26.140 --> 22:29.540]  the odor, the flavor, trichome development.
[22:29.540 --> 22:31.500]  Took both of those and just shook them up.
[22:31.500 --> 22:34.620]  Took all the trait counts from each plant, shook them up and just grew them.
[22:34.620 --> 22:38.940]  Who knows what ornaments got hung on which tree, which alleles got given to each plant,
[22:38.940 --> 22:42.420]  but sometimes you're going to see some that just looks like you just mixed up Mr. Potato
[22:42.420 --> 22:44.180]  Head and got the parts that you got.
[22:44.180 --> 22:45.500]  All right, something different.
[22:45.500 --> 22:46.620]  Thank you for the great question.
[22:46.620 --> 22:50.100]  I hope I was able to answer your question within all of that rambling.
