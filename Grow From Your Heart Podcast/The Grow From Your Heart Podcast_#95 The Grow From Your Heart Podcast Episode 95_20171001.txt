[00:16.760 --> 00:18.860]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:18.860 --> 00:20.860]  It is time for episode number 95
[00:20.860 --> 00:22.960]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:22.960 --> 00:27.060]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.060 --> 00:28.160]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.160 --> 00:29.700]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.700 --> 00:31.940]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:31.940 --> 00:33.440]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:33.440 --> 00:34.880]  or if you're just someone who's curious
[00:34.880 --> 00:36.400]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.400 --> 00:39.480]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.480 --> 00:41.680]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.680 --> 00:43.920]  I wanna thank you guys for joining the show.
[00:43.920 --> 00:45.880]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.600]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:48.600 --> 00:50.340]  for allowing me to use their music on the show.
[00:50.340 --> 00:52.340]  Big shout out to Kat, Coop,
[00:52.340 --> 00:54.540]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.540 --> 00:56.080]  What's up guys, I'm gonna turn down this music.
[00:56.080 --> 00:57.540]  That was a little bit loud this time.
[00:57.540 --> 00:59.020]  I apologize for that.
[00:59.020 --> 01:02.160]  I do not have any ads for this show,
[01:02.160 --> 01:04.920]  but I do wanna give a shout out to all my friends
[01:04.920 --> 01:08.120]  that joined me for the reggae show a couple of days ago.
[01:08.120 --> 01:10.440]  On Tuesday, I got to go up to the Fillmore Auditorium
[01:10.440 --> 01:14.000]  in Denver, Colorado, and I got to see Morgan Heritage,
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.080]  Taurus Riley, Steven Marley, and Damian Marley.
[01:18.080 --> 01:20.480]  It was a great show, lots of reggae,
[01:20.480 --> 01:23.480]  lots of good vibes, lots of love, lots of ganja smoking.
[01:24.360 --> 01:27.160]  Big shout out to Arnie and Rive for being great friends.
[01:27.160 --> 01:28.000]  They joined me up there.
[01:28.000 --> 01:29.040]  We had a great time at the show.
[01:29.040 --> 01:30.360]  And also big shout out to Danielle
[01:30.360 --> 01:32.360]  for being a great reggae date.
[01:32.360 --> 01:34.100]  Also big shout out to Rasta Stevie.
[01:34.100 --> 01:35.540]  What's up brother, it was great seeing you there.
[01:35.540 --> 01:38.560]  I think sometimes you might listen to the podcast.
[01:38.560 --> 01:41.040]  All right, you guys, I've got a couple of things coming up.
[01:41.040 --> 01:44.000]  In this episode, we are going to address an email
[01:44.000 --> 01:45.440]  that was sent to me from a friend.
[01:45.440 --> 01:47.600]  He wants to talk about something I said
[01:47.600 --> 01:49.640]  in the episode about bag seeds.
[01:49.640 --> 01:51.800]  So we will discuss that.
[01:51.800 --> 01:55.200]  But first I want to read a news article that just came out.
[01:55.200 --> 01:58.120]  This article came out on September 16th.
[01:58.120 --> 02:00.640]  I found it in the Cannabis of Course.
[02:00.640 --> 02:04.120]  This article was written by David Magoya and Ricardo Baca.
[02:04.120 --> 02:05.840]  And the article headline says,
[02:05.840 --> 02:10.560]  Colorado Ag Examining Pot Industry Use of Organic Term.
[02:11.080 --> 02:11.920]  The sub headline says,
[02:11.920 --> 02:14.360]  because marijuana is illegal under federal law,
[02:14.360 --> 02:17.240]  the use of the term organic is federally regulated.
[02:17.240 --> 02:19.440]  The state licensed cannabis business
[02:19.440 --> 02:22.840]  can't be certified as organic no matter their practices.
[02:22.840 --> 02:24.640]  I'm going to turn up my headphones just a little bit
[02:24.640 --> 02:26.720]  and then I will read this article for you.
[02:28.120 --> 02:29.200]  Headphones are loud enough.
[02:29.200 --> 02:30.720]  Here we go, mic check, headphones.
[02:30.720 --> 02:31.560]  That's much better.
[02:31.560 --> 02:33.560]  All right, the article goes like this.
[02:33.560 --> 02:35.480]  Colorado's attorney general is investigating
[02:35.480 --> 02:37.640]  several marijuana businesses over concerns
[02:37.640 --> 02:39.880]  the word organic in their names or advertising
[02:39.920 --> 02:42.080]  might be misleading to consumers.
[02:42.080 --> 02:44.840]  The office is reviewing complaints from the consumers
[02:44.840 --> 02:47.600]  that the merchants have been misrepresenting their product
[02:47.600 --> 02:49.840]  when they say organic or organically grown,
[02:49.840 --> 02:51.040]  said Roger Hudson,
[02:51.040 --> 02:54.040]  spokesman for state attorney general Cynthia Kaufman.
[02:54.040 --> 02:56.200]  We're looking for information inside those complaints
[02:56.200 --> 02:59.320]  to make a determination on what those next steps are.
[02:59.320 --> 03:00.560]  Is it consumer fraud?
[03:00.560 --> 03:01.800]  Is it criminal?
[03:01.800 --> 03:03.600]  The Ag's office would not give more detail
[03:03.600 --> 03:04.920]  on the scope of the investigation,
[03:04.920 --> 03:07.360]  but a lawyer who represents a marijuana business
[03:07.360 --> 03:09.680]  contacted by investigators said it appears
[03:10.520 --> 03:11.360]  to have limits.
[03:11.360 --> 03:13.360]  The inquiry includes grow operations,
[03:13.360 --> 03:15.200]  some with organic in their names,
[03:15.200 --> 03:17.000]  recently caught up in Denver quarantines
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.640]  over pesticide concerns, attorney Sean McAllister said.
[03:20.640 --> 03:22.360]  Sorry guys, I read that statement a little bit oddly,
[03:22.360 --> 03:24.840]  but you caught what I said or what it said.
[03:24.840 --> 03:29.120]  The Ag is ensuring that businesses that use the word
[03:29.120 --> 03:31.720]  are at least consistent with the concept of organic,
[03:31.720 --> 03:33.400]  McAllister said.
[03:33.400 --> 03:35.600]  Because marijuana is illegal under federal law
[03:35.600 --> 03:38.240]  and use of the term organic is federally regulated,
[03:38.240 --> 03:40.760]  a licensed cannabis business cannot be certified
[03:40.760 --> 03:43.160]  as organic no matter its practices.
[03:43.160 --> 03:45.480]  As such, no marijuana businesses in Colorado
[03:45.480 --> 03:47.560]  can technically use the word in its name
[03:47.560 --> 03:48.720]  or in selling its product,
[03:48.720 --> 03:51.200]  according to officials and industry insiders.
[03:52.080 --> 03:53.280]  Potential fraud penalties
[03:53.280 --> 03:55.200]  under the Colorado Consumer Protection Act
[03:55.200 --> 03:58.760]  include fines of up to $10,000 per violation.
[03:58.760 --> 04:00.280]  Federal rules say that businesses
[04:00.280 --> 04:02.080]  wrongly selling a product as organic
[04:02.080 --> 04:05.400]  could face fines of up to $10,000.
[04:05.400 --> 04:07.240]  Yet those rules have not been enforced
[04:07.280 --> 04:10.440]  on Colorado's marijuana businesses until now.
[04:10.440 --> 04:13.800]  State marijuana license records show that 29 businesses,
[04:13.800 --> 04:15.560]  growers, retailers, and dispensaries
[04:15.560 --> 04:17.880]  use the word organic in their name.
[04:17.880 --> 04:20.900]  Some use a trade name containing the word organic
[04:20.900 --> 04:23.560]  to market marijuana products or use the term
[04:23.560 --> 04:26.520]  or do use the term in their advertising.
[04:26.520 --> 04:28.840]  A spot check of websites by the Denver Post
[04:28.840 --> 04:32.320]  found businesses claiming to sell 100% organic cannabis,
[04:32.320 --> 04:34.480]  offering organic treatments of medical marijuana
[04:34.480 --> 04:37.680]  or use only organic methods to produce their product.
[04:37.680 --> 04:40.600]  Some shops describe their product as grown in organic soil
[04:40.600 --> 04:43.480]  or that they use organic growing techniques.
[04:43.480 --> 04:46.800]  Another website touts certification of organic standards
[04:46.800 --> 04:50.200]  and testing that mirrors the US Department of Agriculture
[04:50.200 --> 04:52.040]  organic certification.
[04:52.040 --> 04:55.080]  Brooke Wise, owner of The Growing Kitchen in Boulder,
[04:55.080 --> 04:56.520]  said that she's willing to take the risk
[04:56.520 --> 04:58.080]  of labeling her company's edibles
[04:58.080 --> 05:01.000]  made with certified organic seeds and fruits as organic,
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.400]  even if the marijuana in them isn't.
[05:03.400 --> 05:04.960]  It's a principle, an ideology
[05:04.960 --> 05:07.120]  that doesn't belong to anybody, she said,
[05:07.120 --> 05:11.680]  noting her plants would be certified organic if that existed.
[05:11.680 --> 05:14.400]  On the list of sacrifices and gambles I take,
[05:14.400 --> 05:16.560]  organic is definitely on there.
[05:16.560 --> 05:18.120]  But River Rock Cannabis in Denver
[05:18.120 --> 05:20.000]  has backed away from using the term.
[05:20.000 --> 05:21.680]  Until recently, the company had been known
[05:21.680 --> 05:24.680]  as River Rock Organic Medical Cannabis.
[05:24.680 --> 05:26.300]  The attorney general sent something saying
[05:26.300 --> 05:29.520]  that no dispensary can be certified as organic,
[05:29.520 --> 05:31.720]  retail manager Chris Haggerty said.
[05:31.720 --> 05:32.960]  The company changed signs,
[05:32.960 --> 05:34.520]  stopped handing out promotional items
[05:34.520 --> 05:35.400]  with the company's name,
[05:35.400 --> 05:36.800]  and even stopped selling t-shirts
[05:36.800 --> 05:39.320]  with the old company name, Haggerty said.
[05:39.320 --> 05:42.180]  A group seeking to have marijuana certifiable as organic,
[05:42.180 --> 05:44.280]  said a system for informing consumers
[05:44.280 --> 05:46.640]  how marijuana is grown is needed.
[05:46.640 --> 05:48.880]  The word organic is being used inappropriately
[05:48.880 --> 05:51.640]  by people who are using very toxic chemicals.
[05:51.640 --> 05:54.040]  There's no governing agency that is regulating that,
[05:54.040 --> 05:55.440]  said John Paul Maxfield,
[05:55.440 --> 05:59.000]  co-founder of the Organic Cannabis Association in Denver.
[05:59.000 --> 06:01.200]  In the absence of a body coming through
[06:01.200 --> 06:03.000]  and branding organic cannabis,
[06:03.000 --> 06:04.840]  that term can be used by everybody,
[06:04.840 --> 06:07.480]  even if it's not done properly.
[06:07.480 --> 06:10.120]  The USDA accredits companies and state governments
[06:10.120 --> 06:11.840]  to certify any farm as complying
[06:11.840 --> 06:15.040]  with federal organic regulations for agricultural products.
[06:15.040 --> 06:18.440]  No company may use the term without this certification.
[06:18.440 --> 06:20.460]  Marijuana may not be certified organic
[06:20.460 --> 06:22.600]  under the USDA organic regulations,
[06:22.600 --> 06:24.560]  said a USDA spokesman,
[06:24.560 --> 06:27.040]  who could not be named because it's the agency's policy
[06:27.040 --> 06:28.720]  when discussing marijuana.
[06:28.720 --> 06:30.600]  Marijuana is considered a controlled substance
[06:30.640 --> 06:31.480]  at the federal level,
[06:31.480 --> 06:33.280]  and organic certification is reserved
[06:33.280 --> 06:35.280]  for agricultural products.
[06:35.280 --> 06:38.720]  The USDA's National Organic Program rules
[06:38.720 --> 06:40.640]  say companies with organic in their name
[06:40.640 --> 06:42.920]  cannot prominently display it on a product
[06:42.920 --> 06:44.560]  and cannot use the name at all
[06:44.560 --> 06:46.240]  if it misrepresents that a product
[06:46.240 --> 06:48.440]  has been certified organic.
[06:48.440 --> 06:50.720]  It falls to the Colorado Department of Agriculture
[06:50.720 --> 06:53.480]  to certify and accredit agricultural businesses
[06:53.480 --> 06:55.000]  in the state as organic,
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.800]  as well as police for inappropriate and illegal uses
[06:57.800 --> 07:00.380]  of the word on behalf of the USDA.
[07:01.160 --> 07:04.160]  If the state chose to certify marijuana as organic,
[07:04.160 --> 07:06.040]  it would have to ignore federal rules,
[07:06.040 --> 07:07.880]  and that's unlikely, said Mitch Yerger,
[07:07.880 --> 07:10.620]  director of CDA's Plant Industry Division.
[07:12.280 --> 07:14.720]  That's weird because we've already ignored federal rules
[07:14.720 --> 07:17.000]  and we have legalized recreational cannabis,
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.040]  so why wouldn't we just do it again?
[07:19.040 --> 07:20.600]  Anyway, that's my opinion on that.
[07:20.600 --> 07:22.760]  The state's inquiry came after the Denver Department
[07:22.760 --> 07:24.680]  of Environmental Health this year quarantined
[07:24.680 --> 07:28.960]  more than 100,000 marijuana plants over pesticide concerns.
[07:28.960 --> 07:31.160]  One company, Organic Greens, tested positive
[07:31.160 --> 07:32.920]  for unapproved pesticides,
[07:32.920 --> 07:35.640]  but because it operates publicly as natural remedies,
[07:35.640 --> 07:37.800]  the Ag's office allowed it to keep its name,
[07:37.800 --> 07:39.560]  said McAllister, its attorney.
[07:40.720 --> 07:43.040]  Their actual corporation name is Organic Greens,
[07:43.040 --> 07:44.960]  but they don't use it in advertising,
[07:44.960 --> 07:47.680]  so they don't publicize themselves as organic.
[07:47.680 --> 07:49.880]  They don't do any advertising as organic,
[07:49.880 --> 07:52.600]  so nobody's being misled, McAllister said,
[07:52.600 --> 07:56.000]  confirming the company name under Ag scrutiny.
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.880]  McAllister said the Ag is focusing,
[07:57.880 --> 08:02.440]  at least in part, on companies that have used pesticides
[08:02.440 --> 08:04.840]  not allowed by the state for use on marijuana.
[08:04.840 --> 08:07.040]  They understand you can't get federal certification
[08:07.040 --> 08:09.200]  for the word organic in marijuana, he said.
[08:10.080 --> 08:12.240]  The Ag's office is not substituting themselves
[08:12.240 --> 08:16.440]  for a certification agency, but if it's clearly not organic,
[08:16.440 --> 08:18.600]  if someone's using Mallet or Eagle 20,
[08:18.600 --> 08:21.220]  they're also looking for those cases.
[08:21.220 --> 08:23.640]  Mallet and Eagle 20 are pesticide trade names
[08:24.480 --> 08:26.500]  whose active ingredients contain chemicals
[08:26.500 --> 08:30.020]  the state has not approved for use on marijuana.
[08:30.020 --> 08:31.420]  And I've said this on a previous episode,
[08:31.420 --> 08:32.940]  but I was speaking with somebody
[08:32.940 --> 08:34.220]  from the Department of Agriculture.
[08:34.220 --> 08:36.980]  They actually came to, I'm the master grower
[08:36.980 --> 08:38.740]  at the spot dispensary, so I had to meet
[08:38.740 --> 08:40.420]  with the Department of Agriculture.
[08:40.420 --> 08:43.020]  They sent two reps down to come talk to us,
[08:43.020 --> 08:46.700]  and the main rep told me that the main reason
[08:46.700 --> 08:50.160]  that Eagle 20 has been banned from dispensary uses
[08:50.160 --> 08:53.180]  is because if there's a fire and the Eagle 20 burns,
[08:53.220 --> 08:56.820]  the off-gassing turns into cyanide,
[08:56.820 --> 08:59.500]  and the fire department doesn't wanna go into a building
[08:59.500 --> 09:02.300]  that is filled with the gas of cyanide.
[09:02.300 --> 09:04.100]  So that's mainly why Eagle 20 has been banned.
[09:04.100 --> 09:06.860]  Also, it's completely toxic, but he didn't even seem
[09:06.860 --> 09:08.700]  to care about the toxicity of the product.
[09:08.700 --> 09:11.520]  He just wanted to tell me about it turning into cyanide
[09:11.520 --> 09:13.060]  is why it's been banned from use
[09:13.060 --> 09:15.280]  in commercial grow facilities.
[09:15.280 --> 09:16.480]  So I'll keep going with the article.
[09:16.480 --> 09:17.860]  There's one more sentence here left,
[09:17.860 --> 09:18.820]  one more short paragraph.
[09:18.820 --> 09:21.060]  It says, although no chemical pesticide
[09:21.060 --> 09:23.580]  can obtain federal approval for use on cannabis,
[09:23.580 --> 09:25.460]  state agriculture officials have determined
[09:25.460 --> 09:27.340]  which products have labels whose restrictions
[09:27.340 --> 09:30.580]  are so broadly worded that using them on marijuana
[09:30.580 --> 09:33.460]  would not be a violation.
[09:33.460 --> 09:36.020]  So they're cracking down on it, you guys.
[09:36.020 --> 09:38.820]  When I first started in the medical marijuana world,
[09:38.820 --> 09:40.820]  I was shopping at a dispensary that had the word
[09:40.820 --> 09:43.380]  organic in it, and I knew right away,
[09:43.380 --> 09:45.520]  when I looked at the medicine, when I saw how they grew,
[09:45.520 --> 09:49.020]  I knew there was nothing to do with actual organics.
[09:49.020 --> 09:50.860]  They were just trying to use the word organic
[09:51.620 --> 09:54.540]  as a marketing ploy, and it was working.
[09:54.540 --> 09:58.460]  And also, just to put this out there,
[09:58.460 --> 10:02.740]  they do require that all of the ingredients
[10:02.740 --> 10:05.860]  used in the grow, anything that was sprayed
[10:05.860 --> 10:08.060]  or fed to the plants does have to be listed
[10:08.060 --> 10:12.020]  on an instruction list, or instruction ingredients list,
[10:12.020 --> 10:14.260]  I'm sorry, an ingredients list on the outside
[10:14.260 --> 10:15.100]  of the container.
[10:15.100 --> 10:17.240]  So all of that shit does have to be listed
[10:17.240 --> 10:20.260]  on the package that the cannabis or hatch is sold in.
[10:20.660 --> 10:22.060]  Actually, let me reach over here.
[10:22.060 --> 10:23.220]  This is just the inner packaging.
[10:23.220 --> 10:25.120]  This one doesn't have the ingredients on it, sorry.
[10:25.120 --> 10:27.180]  But most of the time, it's got a few things written on it.
[10:27.180 --> 10:29.660]  And if you come by cannabis in the state of Colorado,
[10:29.660 --> 10:32.340]  you'll get a little jar, like a childproof jar
[10:32.340 --> 10:33.760]  or whatever they put the cannabis in,
[10:33.760 --> 10:35.540]  and it'll have some ingredients listed on it.
[10:35.540 --> 10:37.540]  And you'll see things like calcium,
[10:37.540 --> 10:41.260]  and you'll see things like mycos and beneficial bacteria,
[10:41.260 --> 10:42.240]  and you'll see stuff like that.
[10:42.240 --> 10:44.720]  That's all what was used in the growing of the plant.
[10:44.720 --> 10:47.620]  So they will also hopefully list any pesticides
[10:47.620 --> 10:49.100]  that were sprayed on there.
[10:49.100 --> 10:52.340]  All right, so they're cracking down on the name organic,
[10:52.340 --> 10:54.560]  then they are also cracking down to make sure
[10:54.560 --> 10:57.460]  that your shit is organic, which I really appreciate.
[10:57.460 --> 10:59.300]  I really like that because there are a lot of shops
[10:59.300 --> 11:00.820]  serving up doo-doo that you can tell
[11:00.820 --> 11:02.000]  it was not organically grown.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.100]  You can taste the fertilizers in it.
[11:04.100 --> 11:07.120]  I know friends that own hydro shops,
[11:07.120 --> 11:08.980]  and I know friends that are reps
[11:08.980 --> 11:12.500]  and consultants for dispensaries,
[11:12.500 --> 11:15.280]  and they go to places that claim to be running organics.
[11:15.280 --> 11:17.620]  And then when they make their order from the hydro shop,
[11:17.620 --> 11:20.460]  or when they set up a nutrient schedule with the consultant,
[11:20.460 --> 11:23.540]  they go with the product that is completely not organic,
[11:23.540 --> 11:25.500]  and they don't seem to give a shit.
[11:25.500 --> 11:26.580]  But you can't say anything,
[11:26.580 --> 11:27.900]  you just gotta let them do their thing.
[11:27.900 --> 11:30.780]  So I'm glad now somebody is going to call them out
[11:30.780 --> 11:32.240]  and make them accountable.
[11:32.240 --> 11:34.660]  All right, I'm gonna take a dab and a quick drink,
[11:34.660 --> 11:37.140]  and then we're going to address an email
[11:37.140 --> 11:38.920]  that was sent to us by a listener
[11:38.920 --> 11:42.220]  about something I said in episode number 90.
[11:42.220 --> 11:44.820]  So hang out for a few seconds, and I'll be right back.
[11:44.820 --> 11:45.960]  All right, you guys, I am back.
[11:45.960 --> 11:46.800]  I just wanted to let you know,
[11:46.800 --> 11:48.960]  if you hear a bunch of a ruckus in the background there,
[11:48.960 --> 11:50.520]  there are no hostages in my house.
[11:50.520 --> 11:53.320]  There's actually a football game happening right now.
[11:53.320 --> 11:55.120]  There's a Denver Broncos game,
[11:55.120 --> 11:56.800]  and my neighbors are having a party,
[11:56.800 --> 11:58.360]  and I got my window open a little bit.
[11:58.360 --> 11:59.840]  So whenever something happens in the game,
[11:59.840 --> 12:02.760]  you can hear them either cheer or jeer,
[12:02.760 --> 12:04.520]  whichever way it goes.
[12:04.520 --> 12:05.360]  It's pretty entertaining.
[12:05.360 --> 12:06.780]  So if you hear the screams,
[12:06.780 --> 12:08.760]  no, I don't have hostages here in the house.
[12:08.760 --> 12:11.720]  It's just a football game, and people are going crazy.
[12:12.880 --> 12:14.680]  So, all right, just a few days ago,
[12:14.680 --> 12:16.660]  I received an email from a friend of ours.
[12:17.520 --> 12:18.360]  Let's get into this email.
[12:18.360 --> 12:19.180]  I'm pulling it up in my phone right now.
[12:19.180 --> 12:20.180]  Here we go.
[12:20.180 --> 12:21.900]  All right, this email is from our friend Justin,
[12:21.900 --> 12:24.440]  and it says, I just listened to episode 90.
[12:24.440 --> 12:27.400]  I guess I was operating on some incorrect information.
[12:27.400 --> 12:30.020]  You and Jesse seem to feel like herms are really bad.
[12:30.020 --> 12:33.280]  I was told herm seeds were pretty much feminized seeds
[12:33.280 --> 12:35.620]  since the genetics all came from females.
[12:35.620 --> 12:39.060]  So basically we would revege out plants after harvest
[12:39.060 --> 12:41.980]  and then light poison them to make seeds for the future.
[12:41.980 --> 12:44.300]  So I'm wondering if those progeny from the seeds
[12:44.300 --> 12:47.000]  would be predisposed to herm in the future.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.060]  If you could just explain a little to me
[12:49.060 --> 12:51.980]  or cover this on the show, I would super duper love that.
[12:51.980 --> 12:55.620]  Thanks, Ross DeJeff from Justin G.
[12:55.620 --> 12:57.860]  All right, so the seeds you're talking about
[12:57.860 --> 12:59.900]  are not necessarily herms.
[12:59.900 --> 13:01.060]  Hermaphrodite seeds are different.
[13:01.060 --> 13:05.420]  Hermaphrodite seeds come from when there is a female plant
[13:05.420 --> 13:07.820]  in the room that suddenly pops a male flower,
[13:07.820 --> 13:10.820]  and that male flower pollinates the room,
[13:10.820 --> 13:15.040]  and a few seeds happen from that small pollination.
[13:15.040 --> 13:17.460]  So there's a big difference in kind of a hermaphrodite seed
[13:17.460 --> 13:18.580]  and what you're talking about.
[13:18.580 --> 13:20.940]  I took a few notes and wrote a few things down.
[13:20.940 --> 13:22.720]  I'm gonna kind of try to read this to you
[13:22.720 --> 13:25.660]  and sound like I'm not reading something to you.
[13:25.660 --> 13:27.120]  But here's what I wrote.
[13:27.120 --> 13:30.080]  Those seeds that you made are made by stressing the plant.
[13:30.080 --> 13:32.720]  So as long as there were no males
[13:32.720 --> 13:35.540]  or stray pollen available to the females,
[13:35.540 --> 13:37.900]  and also the females are solid females,
[13:37.900 --> 13:39.700]  the seeds produced will be females
[13:39.700 --> 13:42.780]  because of the lack of a Y male chromosome.
[13:42.780 --> 13:44.780]  So technically, those won't be herm seeds
[13:44.780 --> 13:47.380]  if none of the females hermaphrodited
[13:47.380 --> 13:50.460]  and made male flowers that released pollen in there,
[13:50.460 --> 13:51.860]  and they should be feminized.
[13:51.860 --> 13:53.340]  So as long as none of your female plants
[13:53.340 --> 13:55.460]  are throwing off bananas or male pollen sacks,
[13:55.460 --> 13:57.300]  you will be making female seeds here.
[13:58.220 --> 14:00.780]  If a plant is allowed to flower for too long,
[14:00.780 --> 14:02.380]  it'll often make seeds.
[14:02.380 --> 14:04.340]  If a plant is light-stressed,
[14:04.340 --> 14:05.780]  which is what you guys are doing,
[14:05.780 --> 14:07.620]  then those plants will make seeds,
[14:07.620 --> 14:09.020]  and those seeds are feminized.
[14:09.020 --> 14:12.060]  Another way to make feminized seeds
[14:12.060 --> 14:15.220]  is Soma takes a plant that is almost finished.
[14:15.220 --> 14:16.660]  It'll be around week six or seven.
[14:16.660 --> 14:17.620]  For like a nine-week plant,
[14:17.620 --> 14:19.660]  he'll take it around week six or seven,
[14:19.660 --> 14:22.220]  and then he will light a small fire
[14:22.220 --> 14:24.340]  and put that fire next to the plant
[14:24.340 --> 14:26.420]  to make it feel like it's in a forest fire.
[14:26.420 --> 14:28.500]  He will heat the shit out of the plant.
[14:28.500 --> 14:30.780]  He'll move the heat around the plant and kind of freak it out
[14:30.780 --> 14:33.200]  and that plant thinks it's in a forest fire,
[14:33.200 --> 14:35.900]  and its panic reaction is to start making seeds.
[14:35.900 --> 14:38.240]  So he'll have to give it four to six weeks from there
[14:38.240 --> 14:40.440]  to finish seeding, but by week 12,
[14:40.440 --> 14:45.200]  Soma will have a big batch of feminized S1 seeds
[14:45.200 --> 14:48.240]  that don't have any other chromosomes in them
[14:48.240 --> 14:52.280]  except the chromosomes coming from that plant.
[14:52.280 --> 14:55.560]  So you're going to be basically copying the plant
[14:55.560 --> 14:57.600]  that you just stressed.
[14:57.600 --> 14:59.760]  So you are making feminized seeds there.
[14:59.760 --> 15:01.840]  When Jessie and I were talking about hermaphrodite seeds,
[15:01.840 --> 15:05.200]  we were talking more about seeds that were caused
[15:05.200 --> 15:07.680]  by a hermaphrodite issue in a room.
[15:08.120 --> 15:11.160]  So if, say, one of your females were to pop a pollen sack
[15:11.160 --> 15:14.680]  during week seven or whatever, week six or seven,
[15:14.680 --> 15:16.560]  and that hits another plant and it pollinates
[15:16.560 --> 15:18.060]  and it makes a little bit of seed,
[15:18.060 --> 15:20.720]  that seed will be kind of questionable.
[15:20.720 --> 15:22.500]  It may have hermaphroditic traits,
[15:22.500 --> 15:25.720]  but it still could be gold is what we were talking about.
[15:25.720 --> 15:27.940]  So there is a little bit of difference in herm seed
[15:27.940 --> 15:28.880]  and what you're doing.
[15:28.880 --> 15:31.680]  A herm seed is kind of a trait issue.
[15:31.680 --> 15:33.640]  What you're doing is kind of a manipulation,
[15:33.640 --> 15:36.640]  sort of a stressing and a panic reaction sort of a thing.
[15:36.640 --> 15:38.340]  I encourage you to keep doing that.
[15:39.280 --> 15:41.100]  If you got any extra seeds, man,
[15:41.100 --> 15:42.840]  I'd love to grow a couple of those and see what they do.
[15:42.840 --> 15:44.840]  I'll take some pictures for you.
[15:44.840 --> 15:48.040]  So one thing that I do that's kind of on this realm,
[15:48.040 --> 15:49.880]  and this is just because I wanted to rant about this.
[15:49.880 --> 15:51.720]  It's kind of what this reminded me of.
[15:51.720 --> 15:55.080]  Before I breed with plants, I will take my females
[15:55.080 --> 15:57.160]  and I will put them in the flowering room
[15:57.160 --> 15:58.880]  and I will set the timer to 12, 12,
[15:58.880 --> 16:00.960]  and I'll let them flower for about two weeks.
[16:00.960 --> 16:04.640]  And as soon as I see bud set, I will reverse the timer
[16:04.640 --> 16:07.000]  from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.000]  I will now have them off from 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.280]  and they will come on at 9 p.m. till 9 a.m.
[16:12.280 --> 16:14.120]  for about five days.
[16:14.120 --> 16:16.000]  And then after five or six days,
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.560]  I will put the timer back to the original 12, 12.
[16:18.560 --> 16:21.320]  They'll come on at 9 a.m. and go off at 9 p.m.
[16:21.320 --> 16:22.780]  And I'll pay real close attention to them
[16:22.780 --> 16:24.320]  for about a week and a half.
[16:24.320 --> 16:25.960]  And then I'll fuck with the timer again.
[16:25.960 --> 16:28.040]  I'll turn it on for 24 hours.
[16:28.040 --> 16:28.880]  Why not?
[16:28.880 --> 16:30.360]  And then I'll just do weird random shit
[16:30.360 --> 16:31.800]  with my schedules in there.
[16:31.800 --> 16:34.680]  And then I'll put it back on 12, 12 for a few days
[16:34.680 --> 16:36.240]  and watch the plants.
[16:36.240 --> 16:38.200]  And if they start freaking out real bad,
[16:38.200 --> 16:39.680]  then I kind of get rid of the plants
[16:39.680 --> 16:41.220]  that can't handle some stress.
[16:42.200 --> 16:43.680]  Sometimes I go light stress testing
[16:43.680 --> 16:45.200]  because a little bit will tell me what I want to see.
[16:45.200 --> 16:47.360]  But sometimes you get curious as a grower
[16:47.360 --> 16:50.160]  and you want to go through and really pummel a female plant
[16:50.160 --> 16:51.400]  and see what that bitch can handle
[16:51.400 --> 16:54.320]  before you go putting her into a major breeding project.
[16:54.320 --> 16:56.360]  So I've actually got a couple of plants
[16:56.360 --> 16:59.080]  that I can take them to week two
[16:59.080 --> 17:00.740]  and totally reverse the light cycle
[17:00.740 --> 17:01.980]  and it doesn't piss them off.
[17:01.980 --> 17:04.840]  I can do it a couple of times and they don't harm out.
[17:04.840 --> 17:07.940]  However, if I let those same plants go long enough
[17:08.820 --> 17:11.820]  without any light stress, if I let them go too long,
[17:11.820 --> 17:13.380]  they will start to produce seeds.
[17:13.380 --> 17:16.340]  Because I've let some strains go up to 80 days,
[17:16.340 --> 17:18.020]  strains that should only go 60,
[17:18.020 --> 17:19.940]  I've let them go 80 just to see what happens.
[17:19.940 --> 17:21.460]  When you grow as much as we do,
[17:21.460 --> 17:22.380]  you end up playing with some things.
[17:22.380 --> 17:23.900]  That's how you learn a lot of shit.
[17:23.900 --> 17:26.280]  I let them go a little bit long just to see what happened.
[17:26.280 --> 17:28.300]  And it was seeded.
[17:28.300 --> 17:31.740]  The plant had by that 20 extra days put seeds in my plant.
[17:31.740 --> 17:33.660]  So you can do it by light stress,
[17:33.660 --> 17:35.180]  you can do it by extending them.
[17:35.180 --> 17:37.340]  There's a lot of different ways to do it.
[17:37.340 --> 17:39.740]  If you're going to stress test your females,
[17:39.740 --> 17:41.740]  I kind of just told you how I would do it.
[17:41.740 --> 17:43.740]  I would just fuck with the light cycles.
[17:43.740 --> 17:45.620]  As a breeder, one thing I want to say is
[17:45.620 --> 17:46.900]  when you grow out those seeds
[17:46.900 --> 17:48.700]  that you're making from manipulated plants,
[17:48.700 --> 17:52.480]  really pay close attention to hermaphroditic traits.
[17:52.480 --> 17:54.060]  You may not find the hermaphrodites
[17:54.060 --> 17:56.080]  until like week eight of a nine week plant
[17:56.080 --> 17:57.100]  or of a 10 week plant.
[17:57.100 --> 17:59.300]  So really pay attention to that.
[17:59.300 --> 18:00.420]  That shouldn't be there,
[18:00.420 --> 18:04.080]  but you are making a manipulated seed that's not natural.
[18:04.080 --> 18:06.820]  So there is a chance for some weirdness.
[18:06.820 --> 18:09.660]  All right, I hope that answered your question in your email.
[18:09.660 --> 18:11.360]  Go ahead and grow those seeds out, man.
[18:11.360 --> 18:14.000]  That's a great way to keep yourself self sustainable
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.180]  and keep yourself supplied in seeds.
[18:16.180 --> 18:18.200]  You'll be one of those guys that has seeds
[18:18.200 --> 18:19.900]  when the apocalypse comes.
[18:19.900 --> 18:21.700]  So we'll be hanging out.
[18:21.700 --> 18:22.540]  All right, guys,
[18:22.540 --> 18:24.460]  if you want me to read one of your emails on the show,
[18:24.460 --> 18:25.960]  all you got to do is send it to me.
[18:25.960 --> 18:27.800]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[18:27.800 --> 18:30.200]  I'd love to answer your questions.
[18:30.200 --> 18:31.280]  You know I love the interaction.
[18:31.280 --> 18:32.700]  I'd love you guys to follow me on Twitter.
[18:32.700 --> 18:35.040]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[18:35.040 --> 18:36.040]  Find me on Facebook.
[18:36.040 --> 18:37.560]  It's just grow from your heart.
[18:37.560 --> 18:39.240]  I love all of the social media interaction.
[18:39.240 --> 18:40.680]  I do try to interact with everybody.
[18:40.680 --> 18:42.980]  If you send me a message, I will try to respond.
[18:42.980 --> 18:45.320]  It does take me a little bit sometimes
[18:45.320 --> 18:47.480]  because I do get a lot of messages.
[18:47.480 --> 18:49.660]  Of course, I've got the iRegenetics email account
[18:49.660 --> 18:50.800]  that fills up.
[18:50.800 --> 18:53.920]  I've got my own personal email account that fills up.
[18:53.920 --> 18:55.280]  Since I've been doing Periscope videos,
[18:55.640 --> 18:56.620]  I've been getting a lot more messages.
[18:56.620 --> 18:58.840]  So things are going a little bit crazy.
[18:58.840 --> 19:00.800]  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,
[19:00.800 --> 19:02.840]  all that stuff keeps me tied up.
[19:02.840 --> 19:04.520]  And I've been working at the spot
[19:04.520 --> 19:06.260]  doing quite a few hours every week.
[19:06.260 --> 19:08.240]  So that limits my time for social media.
[19:08.240 --> 19:09.740]  But I will answer your question
[19:09.740 --> 19:12.080]  is what I think I am getting to.
[19:12.080 --> 19:13.120]  Please interact with me.
[19:13.120 --> 19:14.320]  I would love it.
[19:14.320 --> 19:15.240]  All right, you guys,
[19:15.240 --> 19:16.320]  I think that's, holy crap,
[19:16.320 --> 19:17.160]  what happened to my throat?
[19:17.160 --> 19:19.080]  Jeez, I apologize for that.
[19:19.080 --> 19:20.640]  I think that's all I've got for you for this week.
[19:20.640 --> 19:22.560]  I thought that news article and that email
[19:22.560 --> 19:23.920]  would take a little bit longer to answer,
[19:23.920 --> 19:26.520]  but I pretty much covered that in 20 minutes.
[19:26.520 --> 19:28.280]  So I'm gonna wrap up this show.
[19:28.280 --> 19:29.120]  I will be back.
[19:29.120 --> 19:31.480]  I am putting together the episode about CBD.
[19:31.480 --> 19:33.360]  I'm trying to get more guests to come be on the show
[19:33.360 --> 19:35.620]  now that it's almost harvest season, you guys.
[19:35.620 --> 19:36.640]  So once everybody cuts down,
[19:36.640 --> 19:38.200]  everybody will be a little bit more available.
[19:38.200 --> 19:40.520]  We'll be able to get all the growers back on the show.
[19:40.520 --> 19:42.240]  I got the Zoom H6,
[19:42.240 --> 19:44.320]  so I'll be able to take the show on the road now.
[19:44.320 --> 19:45.200]  We'll go a few places.
[19:45.200 --> 19:47.840]  I just bought four microphones and four new cables.
[19:47.840 --> 19:49.520]  We'll be able to take that wherever we want
[19:49.520 --> 19:51.160]  and go do some recording with a lot more people.
[19:51.160 --> 19:53.960]  That's gonna open up a lot more options.
[19:53.960 --> 19:54.920]  On the next episode,
[19:54.920 --> 19:59.200]  I plan to answer another email that we got.
[19:59.200 --> 20:02.360]  I wanna address something that I saw at a grower's house
[20:02.360 --> 20:04.000]  when I went to do a consultation,
[20:05.440 --> 20:07.120]  something that they did in their garden
[20:07.120 --> 20:09.440]  that I felt the urge to correct them
[20:09.440 --> 20:11.120]  and I kinda gave them some guidance on it.
[20:11.120 --> 20:12.200]  So I'm gonna share that with you guys.
[20:12.200 --> 20:15.240]  You might be making the same mistakes as this other guy.
[20:15.240 --> 20:16.960]  So I'm gonna share that with you.
[20:16.960 --> 20:18.900]  I've got a lot of great stuff planned.
[20:19.260 --> 20:21.860]  I'll be back Monday with another episode.
[20:21.860 --> 20:24.540]  I wanna thank you guys for joining me.
[20:24.540 --> 20:25.480]  We don't have any sponsors.
[20:25.480 --> 20:26.940]  If you wanna sponsor the podcast,
[20:26.940 --> 20:28.180]  all you gotta do is send me an email.
[20:28.180 --> 20:30.000]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.420]  I'll let you know everything you need to know
[20:31.420 --> 20:32.780]  about sponsoring the show.
[20:32.780 --> 20:35.740]  If you've got a product that you would like me to review,
[20:35.740 --> 20:37.820]  same thing, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[20:37.820 --> 20:39.780]  We would love to review your products.
[20:39.780 --> 20:41.100]  We'll give you an honest opinion.
[20:41.100 --> 20:45.700]  We will expose your product to at least 5,000 consumers
[20:45.700 --> 20:47.420]  that are right up your alley.
[20:47.420 --> 20:48.660]  So if you have a good product, let me know.
[20:49.420 --> 20:50.740]  We'll get it out there for you.
[20:50.740 --> 20:52.420]  If you have something to say, find me on all the social media
[20:52.420 --> 20:53.700]  you guys already said that, right?
[20:53.700 --> 20:55.380]  All right, don't forget that the show is available
[20:55.380 --> 20:57.540]  on iTunes, Stitcher, and every single episode
[20:57.540 --> 21:02.300]  is always and forever archived on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[21:02.300 --> 21:04.140]  Don't forget, I did put a donation button
[21:04.140 --> 21:06.180]  on the podcast page.
[21:06.180 --> 21:08.020]  If you feel like the show is worth a couple of bucks,
[21:08.020 --> 21:08.860]  go to the website.
[21:08.860 --> 21:11.620]  It's iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[21:11.620 --> 21:14.020]  Click on the Grow From Your Heart podcast tab.
[21:14.020 --> 21:15.820]  At the top right, there's a donation button.
[21:15.820 --> 21:17.260]  It's a little PayPal logo.
[21:18.260 --> 21:20.180]  That goes directly to my PayPal account.
[21:20.180 --> 21:22.140]  I'm never gonna charge you for this podcast, you guys.
[21:22.140 --> 21:24.540]  This podcast will always be free.
[21:24.540 --> 21:25.780]  The show is going to be free.
[21:25.780 --> 21:26.660]  I grow from my heart.
[21:26.660 --> 21:27.860]  I give it to you from my heart.
[21:27.860 --> 21:29.880]  I hope you grow from your heart in return.
[21:29.880 --> 21:32.500]  But if you do feel like making a contribution,
[21:32.500 --> 21:35.420]  it would definitely be appreciated.
[21:36.820 --> 21:40.620]  I just bought the new Zoom H6 partially with contributions
[21:40.620 --> 21:41.900]  that came into the podcast.
[21:41.900 --> 21:44.500]  So shout out to everybody who has made a contribution
[21:44.500 --> 21:46.100]  in the past.
[21:46.100 --> 21:47.940]  Also, you guys, now that the show's over,
[21:47.940 --> 21:48.820]  you can go to iTunes.
[21:48.820 --> 21:50.620]  Search for the iTunes, or go to the iTunes store.
[21:50.620 --> 21:51.900]  Search for Grow From Your Heart.
[21:51.900 --> 21:53.620]  Find the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[21:53.620 --> 21:56.260]  Leave me a five-star review, and type in a little comment,
[21:56.260 --> 21:58.420]  and let me know what you think about the podcast.
[21:58.420 --> 22:01.740]  I will read your comments on a future episode.
[22:01.740 --> 22:03.140]  The reason that we want more ratings,
[22:03.140 --> 22:04.420]  and more comments, and more reviews
[22:04.420 --> 22:08.020]  is because that makes us more exposed to a larger audience.
[22:08.020 --> 22:09.640]  The more likes you get, the more comments you get,
[22:09.640 --> 22:12.120]  the more Facebook shares you and exposes you.
[22:12.120 --> 22:13.980]  So the more people that see the show,
[22:13.980 --> 22:16.820]  the more people will learn how to grow quality cannabis.
[22:16.820 --> 22:20.020]  More people will quit spraying shit on their plants.
[22:20.020 --> 22:22.260]  People will learn how to look out for hermaphrodites.
[22:22.260 --> 22:25.700]  People will learn how to just grow better cannabis overall.
[22:25.700 --> 22:27.020]  Everybody will grow cannabis.
[22:27.020 --> 22:28.260]  People will get the right idea.
[22:28.260 --> 22:30.100]  They will get a proper education.
[22:30.100 --> 22:31.540]  Maybe somebody will listen to the show
[22:31.540 --> 22:33.540]  that has never smoked pot before.
[22:33.540 --> 22:34.620]  They'll listen to the show, and they'll say,
[22:34.620 --> 22:37.060]  you know what, this guy smokes a gram of hash
[22:37.060 --> 22:40.100]  every single day, and he's mostly articulate.
[22:40.100 --> 22:41.940]  I know I've got some stoner moments on this show,
[22:41.940 --> 22:43.180]  but that's just me.
[22:43.180 --> 22:44.300]  But I'm mostly articulate.
[22:44.300 --> 22:46.460]  Maybe they'll say, this guy has his shit together.
[22:46.460 --> 22:48.300]  Maybe weed isn't so bad.
[22:48.300 --> 22:49.660]  Then maybe they'll lighten up,
[22:49.660 --> 22:51.380]  and then maybe they'll be on our side.
[22:51.380 --> 22:54.100]  And then maybe one day we can legalize cannabis
[22:54.100 --> 22:56.220]  nationwide, and then worldwide.
[22:56.220 --> 22:57.740]  That's my mission.
[22:57.740 --> 22:59.900]  Legalizing cannabis one click at a time here
[22:59.900 --> 23:01.180]  at the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[23:01.180 --> 23:02.980]  That's what we are doing.
[23:02.980 --> 23:03.820]  All right, you guys.
[23:03.820 --> 23:04.740]  I don't have a lot else to say,
[23:04.740 --> 23:06.420]  so I am gonna wrap up the show.
[23:07.540 --> 23:08.920]  Yeah, follow me on Instagram, you guys.
[23:08.920 --> 23:11.660]  I just hit 18,000 followers.

[23:18.260 --> 23:19.100]  to my ninja spence.
[23:19.100 --> 23:20.260]  Thanks again for listening.
[23:20.260 --> 23:22.820]  Until next time, take a big fat dab.
[23:22.820 --> 23:24.940]  Not just a little dab, you guys, like a big one.
[23:24.940 --> 23:26.560]  Like a half a gram, make it count.
[23:26.560 --> 23:27.400]  You ready?
[23:27.400 --> 23:28.340]  Get in on the dabber.
[23:28.340 --> 23:31.380]  Now take a fat dab, and right after you blow it out,

[24:57.310 --> 25:01.310]  It was found on the grave of King Solomon
[25:01.310 --> 25:05.310]  Wisdom in every limb made him the wisest man
[25:05.310 --> 25:08.310]  Which one of them walk up like a swan

[25:29.310 --> 25:32.310]  We love it when we fly over to Amsterdam
[25:32.310 --> 25:36.310]  We see the people burning the earth so free
[25:36.310 --> 25:38.310]  And nothing but the potpourri
[25:38.310 --> 25:40.310]  They take out the molding paper
[25:40.310 --> 25:44.310]  Go cheap, they rather burn the sweet ganja herb
[25:44.310 --> 25:46.310]  In the coffee shop on the corner
[25:46.310 --> 25:51.310]  It's time they realize it should be legalized
[25:51.310 --> 25:52.310]  Legalized
[25:52.310 --> 25:57.310]  Yes I once, once, always in the real life
