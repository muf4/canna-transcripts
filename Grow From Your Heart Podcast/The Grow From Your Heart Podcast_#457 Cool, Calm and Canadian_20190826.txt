[00:00.000 --> 00:03.320]  Hey, what's up, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers.
[00:03.320 --> 00:07.160]  Welcome to episode 457 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.160 --> 00:10.660]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:10.660 --> 00:15.120]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
[00:15.120 --> 00:20.680]  them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:20.680 --> 00:24.320]  You know we like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:24.320 --> 00:28.960]  Today, I've been taking dabs of watermelon gelato ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[00:28.960 --> 00:29.960]  Farms.
[00:29.960 --> 00:39.560]  The potency label says that this product contains 64.6% THC and 76.7% total cannabinoids.
[00:39.560 --> 00:42.680]  I'm going to crack the jar open now so we can give it a little smell.
[00:42.680 --> 00:46.080]  I really enjoy the aroma and flavor of this concentrate.
[00:46.080 --> 00:52.280]  Immediately, I am punched in the face by a sweet watermelon flavor, followed by a light
[00:52.280 --> 00:54.040]  gassiness that I really enjoy.
[00:54.040 --> 00:57.360]  It is a watermelon, sweet, gassy flavor.
[00:57.360 --> 01:01.100]  When you dab it, that watermelon flavor just coats your mouth.
[01:01.100 --> 01:06.020]  When you exhale, that gassiness sticks in a little bit, and then the room is left with
[01:06.020 --> 01:09.520]  a delicious watermelon candy sort of an aroma.
[01:09.520 --> 01:15.640]  I really enjoy the watermelon gelato ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[01:15.640 --> 01:19.960]  Big shout out to our friends for the delicious concentrates.
[01:19.960 --> 01:23.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode, I'm going to read an email that came from our
[01:23.400 --> 01:25.360]  friends up north in Canada.
[01:25.360 --> 01:28.080]  Big shout out to all of our Canadian listeners.
[01:28.080 --> 01:33.960]  Before we get to the email, I would like to do a few shout outs to our friends on Patreon.
[01:33.960 --> 01:36.400]  Let's start off with a giant shout out to our new friend, Victor.
[01:36.400 --> 01:39.840]  How about a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to Justin.
[01:39.840 --> 01:42.560]  I want to send a giant thank you shout out to Sour D.
[01:42.560 --> 01:47.040]  And last but certainly not least, I owe a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out
[01:47.040 --> 01:48.800]  to my friend Aldridge.
[01:48.800 --> 01:53.000]  I want to thank each and every one of you guys for your continued Patreon support.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.840]  If anybody out there would like to learn how to support the show on Patreon, you can
[01:56.840 --> 02:03.600]  do so by going to www.patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[02:03.600 --> 02:07.440]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:07.440 --> 02:11.880]  All right, podcast world, I am going to read this email that came from Canada, but first
[02:11.880 --> 02:16.160]  I want to talk about something that I keep seeing in social media.
[02:16.160 --> 02:24.640]  Recently, Mike Tyson was quoted saying that he smokes approximately $40,000 a month in
[02:24.640 --> 02:27.400]  cannabis and cannabis products.
[02:27.400 --> 02:30.120]  Now I don't think he meant himself personally.
[02:30.120 --> 02:36.400]  I think that that is him and his entourage or his crew, but imagine what $40,000 in cannabis
[02:36.400 --> 02:38.180]  products would look like.
[02:38.180 --> 02:42.200]  Now cannabis pricing does change throughout the country and absolutely around the world.
[02:42.240 --> 02:47.240]  Mike Tyson has a ranch in Northern California where prices are quite stable.
[02:47.240 --> 02:52.640]  We're going to give a rough guess that for good quality product in Mike Tyson's area,
[02:52.640 --> 02:57.920]  he's probably paying around $2,000 a pound for the product he is smoking.
[02:57.920 --> 03:00.480]  It could be 15, it could be 25.
[03:00.480 --> 03:02.320]  I don't know what's going on in Cali right now.
[03:02.320 --> 03:08.040]  We're going to guess he's paying $2,000 a pound and he's smoking $40,000 worth of product.
[03:08.040 --> 03:13.400]  That is 20 pounds of cannabis every month for Mike Tyson and his crew.
[03:13.400 --> 03:17.440]  I don't know how many people are in that crew, but they are living it up.
[03:17.440 --> 03:22.960]  If you think about that, if you break that down into retail terms, if you look at $40,000
[03:22.960 --> 03:28.680]  worth of cannabis at $25 an eighth, that is 1,608.
[03:28.680 --> 03:30.040]  So how many eighths do you smoke?
[03:30.040 --> 03:32.360]  If you're a flower smoker, how long does an eighth last you?
[03:32.360 --> 03:34.260]  How long does a quarter last you?
[03:34.260 --> 03:37.540]  If you smoke by the quarter, that is 800 quarters.
[03:37.540 --> 03:38.740]  How long would that last you?
[03:38.740 --> 03:40.780]  How long would 800 quarters last you?
[03:40.780 --> 03:43.140]  A lot of people, I'm not sure where you're from.
[03:43.140 --> 03:46.580]  It depends on your location, your budget, and the availability.
[03:46.580 --> 03:49.740]  But most folks tend to smoke about a gram a day.
[03:49.740 --> 03:52.220]  Seven grams a week seems to be expected.
[03:52.220 --> 03:54.980]  A half ounce a week for some a little heavier smokers.
[03:54.980 --> 03:57.880]  And then in the legal states, an ounce a week is not a problem.
[03:57.880 --> 04:03.720]  But these people are smoking $40,000 worth of cannabis in a month.
[04:03.720 --> 04:05.620]  So they claim, and it could have been a joke.
[04:05.620 --> 04:06.620]  It was Mike Tyson.
[04:06.700 --> 04:09.180]  He could have been just laughing and telling a joke when he said it.
[04:09.180 --> 04:14.060]  A lot of times people like to speak in hyperbole, especially stoners, especially when we're
[04:14.060 --> 04:15.820]  talking about our plants and our product.
[04:15.820 --> 04:18.600]  There may be a little exaggeration there.
[04:18.600 --> 04:25.940]  But that man went on a public forum and said, we smoke 40 grand in cannabis every month.
[04:25.940 --> 04:30.700]  And just for a concentrate smoker, for me, concentrates, depending on where you shop,
[04:30.700 --> 04:33.920]  some places it's 30 a gram, some places it's 50 a gram.
[04:33.920 --> 04:36.400]  So I'm going to go with the $40 a gram mark.
[04:36.400 --> 04:42.200]  And we're going to say that is 1000 grams of concentrates in a month.
[04:42.200 --> 04:45.280]  That means I get to smoke 30 grams a day, right?
[04:45.280 --> 04:52.880]  I get to smoke 33 grams of concentrates every day if we were smoking 40 grand in product.
[04:52.880 --> 04:59.360]  So if these guys are smoking concentrate, they're smoking 33.3 grams every single day
[04:59.360 --> 05:00.720]  on the Tyson Ranch.
[05:00.720 --> 05:02.320]  I don't know how many people that is.
[05:02.320 --> 05:05.900]  If that is 10 people, that's pretty heavy consumption.
[05:05.900 --> 05:08.920]  If there are 20 people, you're smoking down.
[05:08.920 --> 05:12.080]  If you got 30 people there, that's about a gram a day per person.
[05:12.080 --> 05:13.120]  And that is acceptable.
[05:13.120 --> 05:15.040]  Maybe one person's hitting a half a gram.
[05:15.040 --> 05:17.840]  Maybe you got a guy like me over there smoking two grams a day.
[05:17.840 --> 05:21.360]  But if you've got more than 30 or so people over there, that is not heavy consumption.
[05:21.360 --> 05:23.000]  You're just smoking a lot of people out.
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.260]  And of course, Tyson does have a ranch where people come and visit.
[05:26.260 --> 05:27.360]  They can hang out on the ranch.
[05:27.360 --> 05:29.920]  It's like a vacation destination for some folks.
[05:29.920 --> 05:34.920]  I am sure that some of that product is being shared and consumed with his guests and visitors
[05:34.920 --> 05:37.920]  because Mike Tyson is a polite and kind dude.
[05:37.920 --> 05:42.880]  So I hope he's sharing some of that $40,000 worth of product with all of his friends over
[05:42.880 --> 05:44.240]  at the Tyson Ranch.
[05:44.240 --> 05:49.560]  You guys, if I had 33.3 grams of concentrate to smoke today, would you want to come over
[05:49.560 --> 05:50.560]  and give me a hand?
[05:50.560 --> 05:51.800]  I hope I can count on you.
[05:51.800 --> 05:52.800]  All right.
[05:52.800 --> 05:54.960]  I just wanted to mention that because I thought that was very entertaining.
[05:54.960 --> 05:58.560]  I've seen that pop up on every social media outlet available.
[05:58.560 --> 06:02.440]  Mike Tyson smokes $40,000 in cannabis every month.
[06:02.440 --> 06:03.560]  That has been a headline.
[06:03.560 --> 06:06.400]  I'm very amused that that has become news.
[06:06.400 --> 06:09.600]  All right, let's move into something that we can help somebody with.
[06:09.600 --> 06:13.080]  Let's work on the email section of this podcast.
[06:13.080 --> 06:16.240]  If you have a grow question or a cannabis culture question, or perhaps you've just got
[06:16.240 --> 06:18.720]  something you'd like to say, you can send me an email.
[06:18.720 --> 06:22.160]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[06:22.160 --> 06:23.600]  I would love to hear from you.
[06:23.600 --> 06:24.600]  Send me an email.
[06:24.600 --> 06:28.140]  Maybe I will read your email on a future episode.
[06:28.140 --> 06:30.820]  The message I'm going to read today comes from a friend in Canada.
[06:30.820 --> 06:34.700]  It does not say if they want us to use their name, so I'm going to skip that.
[06:34.700 --> 06:35.980]  What's up to our friend in Canada?
[06:35.980 --> 06:37.380]  Thank you for the great email.
[06:37.380 --> 06:40.140]  It goes just like this.
[06:40.140 --> 06:41.140]  Much love from Canada.
[06:41.140 --> 06:45.340]  I am three weeks into my first flower and I can only wish I had stumbled across your
[06:45.340 --> 06:47.300]  podcast earlier.
[06:47.300 --> 06:49.100]  You are an impressive person.
[06:49.100 --> 06:50.100]  Simple as that.
[06:50.100 --> 06:51.460]  Hey, that is a great compliment.
[06:51.460 --> 06:53.340]  It kind of made me shy suddenly.
[06:53.340 --> 06:54.780]  That's awkward, but I appreciate that, man.
[06:54.780 --> 06:56.460]  Thank you for listening and learning.
[06:56.460 --> 07:00.180]  I'm glad that you find my knowledge that I share to be impressive.
[07:00.180 --> 07:05.260]  It goes on to say, the support you show toward the community and depth of knowledge is unparalleled.
[07:05.260 --> 07:10.080]  It's not just the content, but the delivery is honest and informative.
[07:10.080 --> 07:15.620]  That means a lot to me because that is my exact goal, is to deliver in-depth knowledge
[07:15.620 --> 07:20.860]  that is unparalleled and to have honest and informative delivery and to sound good and
[07:20.860 --> 07:23.820]  to be a supporter and leader for the community.
[07:23.820 --> 07:27.180]  In one short sentence there, you told me that I'm hitting my goal.
[07:27.180 --> 07:28.180]  That means a lot to me.
[07:28.180 --> 07:29.180]  Thank you.
[07:29.180 --> 07:30.940]  It goes on to say, you'd make a good father if you aren't already.
[07:30.940 --> 07:33.780]  Yes, I am a father and I think I'm doing a pretty good job.
[07:33.780 --> 07:36.140]  My kid's pretty damn cool, so thank you there.
[07:36.140 --> 07:37.140]  Where was I?
[07:37.140 --> 07:38.140]  I lost my place.
[07:38.140 --> 07:43.740]  It goes on to say, I started in around episode 351 and it is amazing how much I have learned.
[07:43.740 --> 07:45.580]  Now I'm going back to the very beginning.
[07:45.580 --> 07:50.020]  Man, you have listened to a hundred and something episodes and now you're going all the way
[07:50.020 --> 07:51.020]  back to the beginning.
[07:51.020 --> 07:54.620]  I think we're going to have a very solid cannabis education.
[07:54.620 --> 07:56.780]  Thank you for listening to so many shows.
[07:56.780 --> 07:59.260]  It's going to be a bit embarrassing when you hear my old stuff.
[07:59.260 --> 08:03.980]  I was not quite the podcaster I have become now, but you got to start somewhere.
[08:03.980 --> 08:05.980]  So listen to them, critique me.
[08:05.980 --> 08:11.820]  Also don't forget that the first 19 episodes of the show are available in a playlist on
[08:11.820 --> 08:12.820]  my YouTube channel.
[08:12.820 --> 08:17.500]  If you go to YouTube, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast, find my YouTube channel.
[08:17.500 --> 08:23.220]  There's a playlist on that channel called the First 20 or the First 19 Episodes.
[08:23.220 --> 08:27.660]  A very long time ago, the podcast was called something different, but I was sent a letter
[08:27.660 --> 08:29.620]  that said I cannot use that name anymore.
[08:29.620 --> 08:32.020]  So I had to change the name of the show.
[08:32.020 --> 08:35.580]  When I changed the name of the show, I created a different YouTube channel.
[08:35.580 --> 08:36.580]  Things change.
[08:36.580 --> 08:38.620]  Anyway, the old episodes are available.
[08:38.620 --> 08:43.140]  One through 19 are available on a playlist on YouTube, so don't miss those.
[08:43.140 --> 08:44.740]  I'm going to catch up in the email.
[08:44.740 --> 08:45.740]  Where was I?
[08:45.740 --> 08:46.740]  I'm going back to the beginning.
[08:46.740 --> 08:50.820]  I even have my brother, his wife, and mother-in-law hooked on your show.
[08:50.820 --> 08:51.820]  That's amazing.
[08:51.820 --> 08:55.380]  You've gotten three, four, two, three other people hooked on the show.
[08:55.380 --> 08:56.380]  I appreciate that.
[08:56.380 --> 09:01.900]  Then it says, I've worked for 13 years now as an addiction counselor and it baffles me
[09:01.900 --> 09:04.940]  the misconceptions with cannabis.
[09:04.940 --> 09:08.920]  I completely agree with you about the misconceptions of cannabis.
[09:08.920 --> 09:10.540]  That is partly why I do a podcast.
[09:10.540 --> 09:13.300]  I feel like I sound like a mostly educated guy.
[09:13.300 --> 09:17.820]  I don't have the highest level of education, but I am just, what's it called?
[09:17.820 --> 09:19.220]  Naturally intelligent, I guess.
[09:19.220 --> 09:20.580]  I'm a smart dude just naturally.
[09:20.580 --> 09:22.180]  I didn't have to go to school and learn a bunch of stuff.
[09:22.180 --> 09:23.180]  I can speak.
[09:23.180 --> 09:24.580]  I can convey my thoughts.
[09:24.580 --> 09:28.940]  I am also a heavy cannabis user and an advocate.
[09:28.940 --> 09:33.900]  I feel like coming on here and speaking mostly articulately, I present myself fairly well,
[09:33.900 --> 09:38.280]  and I feel like I represent the cannabis community in a mostly positive light.
[09:38.280 --> 09:41.540]  Some people may not like the fact that I start the show off by taking a couple of dabs and
[09:41.540 --> 09:43.420]  then come on and tell you what I'm smoking.
[09:43.420 --> 09:45.260]  That may not be for some people.
[09:45.260 --> 09:46.260]  That's how I do it.
[09:46.260 --> 09:50.180]  It works very well for me, but I feel like I represent us in a mostly positive light.
[09:50.180 --> 09:51.180]  I feel like I speak well.
[09:51.180 --> 09:54.300]  I feel like I'm articulate enough to get my point across.
[09:54.300 --> 09:57.500]  I feel like people don't think I'm just some stupid stoner when I do the show.
[09:57.500 --> 10:02.380]  I like to come on and do a show that all of the experienced growers can listen to and
[10:02.380 --> 10:04.860]  be entertained and possibly learn something.
[10:04.860 --> 10:08.900]  Then I like to have a show that maybe some brand new smoker could smoke with grandma
[10:08.900 --> 10:10.540]  and say, hey, listen to this guy, grandma.
[10:10.540 --> 10:11.540]  He's going to teach you some stuff.
[10:11.540 --> 10:17.720]  Then maybe grandma could learn about CBD or grandma can lessen some of her fear of cannabis.
[10:17.720 --> 10:22.100]  Maybe grandma's sick and it's time for her to consider putting some CBD in her diet.
[10:22.100 --> 10:25.020]  Maybe my show could be one of the things that helps break the ice.
[10:25.020 --> 10:29.500]  We can bring people together, non-consumers and consumers, believers and non-believers.
[10:29.500 --> 10:35.580]  Maybe I can bridge that gap by being a good advocate, a good ambassador, a good spokesperson.
[10:35.580 --> 10:40.660]  I've kind of taken it upon myself to play that role in my life, in the cannabis industry,
[10:40.660 --> 10:43.420]  in the cannabis world, in the cannabis community.
[10:43.420 --> 10:47.420]  That's a big part of what started me doing the podcast is the misconceptions and the
[10:47.420 --> 10:50.420]  false information that people are putting on the internet.
[10:50.420 --> 10:51.460]  I needed to speak up.
[10:51.460 --> 10:53.780]  I needed to say, hey, a lot of that stuff is wrong.
[10:53.780 --> 10:55.580]  A lot of that stuff is inaccurate.
[10:55.580 --> 11:00.020]  I wanted to come do a show that is not based on selling products or lining pockets or making
[11:00.020 --> 11:01.020]  money for anybody.
[11:01.020 --> 11:03.900]  I want to come teach you to grow from your heart.
[11:03.900 --> 11:05.900]  That is a lot of what led to this podcast.
[11:05.900 --> 11:08.900]  I'm way off topic on a rant here, but hey, it's my show.
[11:08.900 --> 11:10.900]  You get a podcast if you want to rant about something.
[11:10.900 --> 11:13.180]  Let's get ourselves back on track.
[11:13.180 --> 11:17.820]  There is a lot more to this email that I cut out because I felt that some of this was personal
[11:17.820 --> 11:20.140]  and I wanted to keep that between my friend and I.
[11:20.140 --> 11:24.220]  We're going to catch up where it gets back to where I want to share with you guys.
[11:24.220 --> 11:27.420]  He got rambling also and it says, ah shit, I'm rambling.
[11:27.420 --> 11:29.780]  Anyway, I appreciate your approach.
[11:29.780 --> 11:30.860]  Keep up the good work.
[11:30.860 --> 11:35.860]  And now for my question, he says, I built a little grow room in my garage.
[11:35.860 --> 11:38.180]  So we've got a little grow room in a garage.
[11:38.180 --> 11:43.660]  So it goes on to say, I used a dryer ducting with a four inch inline exhaust fan for air
[11:43.660 --> 11:44.660]  out.
[11:44.660 --> 11:49.020]  So we're using a four inch, probably a squirrel cage fan, maybe a little blower and some dryer
[11:49.020 --> 11:53.340]  ducting to duct the hot stale air out of the room.
[11:53.340 --> 11:59.300]  It goes on to say, air intake is also a four inch dryer duct, which pulls air directly
[11:59.300 --> 12:00.940]  from the outside.
[12:00.940 --> 12:04.260]  So that probably happens naturally from the passive air.
[12:04.260 --> 12:07.820]  As you were pulling that air out of the room with that blower, you're probably sucking
[12:07.820 --> 12:12.900]  fresh air right in through that intake because air will travel the path of least resistance.
[12:12.900 --> 12:16.340]  Every bit of air that leaves that environment does need to be replaced.
[12:16.340 --> 12:20.100]  So it will naturally come in through that passive vent.
[12:20.100 --> 12:25.100]  It goes on to say, being from Northern Canada, it gets cold as hell here in the winter.
[12:25.100 --> 12:29.860]  That's kind of an odd statement because I have always envisioned hell to be quite hot.
[12:29.860 --> 12:32.900]  But now that I think about it, some of the shittiest moments in my life have been when
[12:32.900 --> 12:34.780]  I've been too fucking cold.
[12:34.780 --> 12:36.060]  Everybody hates to be too cold.
[12:36.060 --> 12:37.260]  That is miserable.
[12:37.260 --> 12:39.220]  Maybe we've got it all wrong, you guys.
[12:39.220 --> 12:41.540]  Maybe hell is ice.
[12:41.540 --> 12:42.620]  Let's get back on track here.
[12:42.620 --> 12:43.660]  It keeps going.
[12:43.660 --> 12:48.460]  It says, I have a small space heater that keeps the room at the desired temperature,
[12:48.460 --> 12:55.980]  but will that cold air coming in be an issue as long as it is not too close to the plants?
[12:55.980 --> 12:57.420]  Now this is a very good question.
[12:57.420 --> 12:59.440]  This brings up a lot of good talking points.
[12:59.440 --> 13:04.180]  This is very similar to the last episode where the guy was trying to cool his grow tent.
[13:04.180 --> 13:06.340]  We've got a couple of things to think about here.
[13:06.340 --> 13:11.960]  You were bringing that cold Canadian winter air directly into your grow room.
[13:11.960 --> 13:16.580]  If that air is really cold, I may completely advise against that.
[13:16.700 --> 13:19.540]  There are a couple of reasons why this may be a bad idea.
[13:19.540 --> 13:22.340]  I don't know how cold that air is now.
[13:22.340 --> 13:25.500]  I do know as soon as it snows, it is too cold.
[13:25.500 --> 13:29.460]  You don't want to bring that air into the room, but I do have some solutions and some
[13:29.460 --> 13:31.180]  other things to think about.
[13:31.180 --> 13:34.540]  First, let's talk about ducting that cool air into the room.
[13:34.540 --> 13:36.020]  You can do that.
[13:36.020 --> 13:39.900]  You want to know if you can do it without causing problems to the plants if it is too
[13:39.900 --> 13:40.900]  close to the plants.
[13:40.900 --> 13:44.580]  If it is too close to the plants, they will definitely get cold and get pissed off.
[13:44.580 --> 13:48.780]  The VPD around that area is going to go haywire.
[13:48.780 --> 13:50.340]  You're going to have cold air coming in.
[13:50.340 --> 13:52.620]  Then you've got a fan blowing around that ambient air.
[13:52.620 --> 13:55.320]  You're going to get a lot of mixing of air in that area.
[13:55.320 --> 13:57.940]  The plants are not going to like it.
[13:57.940 --> 14:01.960]  Then you are going to create the perfect environment for powdery mildew.
[14:01.960 --> 14:03.940]  You are bringing in wet air.
[14:03.940 --> 14:05.820]  You are bringing in cold air.
[14:05.820 --> 14:10.060]  You are mixing that with the warm air that is already in your grow room.
[14:10.060 --> 14:14.740]  That is going to create the perfect condition for powdery mildew.
[14:14.740 --> 14:19.620]  Wet air plus a warm environment is going to start powdery mildew.
[14:19.620 --> 14:24.700]  Wet air just coming into the room is going to create powdery mildew situations.
[14:24.700 --> 14:28.260]  Temperature swings are going to create powdery mildew situations.
[14:28.260 --> 14:32.900]  When that light goes off and you're still bringing in that cold Canada snowy air, it
[14:32.900 --> 14:35.620]  is going to get cold really quickly in there.
[14:35.620 --> 14:38.660]  That is going to promote powdery mildew conditions.
[14:38.660 --> 14:44.660]  Also, bringing in that cold air may make your floor ridiculously cold.
[14:44.660 --> 14:48.140]  Also, your Canadian floor is probably really cold anyway in winter.
[14:48.140 --> 14:51.620]  I would recommend getting your plants up off the floor in the winter.
[14:51.620 --> 14:53.060]  You don't want your plants on the floor.
[14:53.060 --> 14:54.420]  I'm here in Colorado.
[14:54.420 --> 14:56.780]  I don't want my plants on a concrete floor.
[14:56.780 --> 14:58.780]  Imagine waking up out of bed.
[14:58.780 --> 15:02.380]  First thing you do, you've got to put your feet on the cold concrete floor.
[15:02.380 --> 15:04.260]  In my story, there's no carpet in your house.
[15:04.260 --> 15:06.620]  You've got to go straight to the concrete floor.
[15:06.620 --> 15:07.620]  That's going to suck.
[15:07.620 --> 15:10.060]  You don't want to put your feet on that frozen floor.
[15:10.060 --> 15:12.180]  First thing when you wake up, that makes you grouchy.
[15:12.180 --> 15:13.460]  It pisses you off.
[15:13.460 --> 15:14.740]  That is how the plants feel.
[15:14.740 --> 15:18.360]  They don't want to be sitting on the cold floor all day long either.
[15:18.360 --> 15:19.820]  We like to elevate them.
[15:19.820 --> 15:23.560]  Then, when you water them, if they're down there on that cold floor, you put the water
[15:23.560 --> 15:24.940]  in there, they're even colder.
[15:24.940 --> 15:26.100]  Now they're wet and cold.
[15:26.100 --> 15:27.580]  You got cold, wet feet.
[15:27.580 --> 15:28.580]  Nobody enjoys that.
[15:28.580 --> 15:30.020]  We want to get the plants up off the floor.
[15:30.020 --> 15:31.660]  We want to get the roots warm.
[15:31.660 --> 15:35.100]  Let's focus more on bringing this cool air into the grow room.
[15:35.100 --> 15:37.520]  We're talking about bringing cold air into the room.
[15:37.520 --> 15:41.920]  You can do that, but you do have to pay attention to the temperature of the air.
[15:41.920 --> 15:48.600]  Once it gets beyond 65 degrees, 60 degrees, you may need to warm that air before it enters
[15:48.600 --> 15:49.600]  the room.
[15:49.600 --> 15:55.680]  In the previous episode, we talked about treating the room and then introducing that air into
[15:55.680 --> 15:56.920]  the grow area.
[15:56.920 --> 16:00.680]  Maybe you can bring that air into another area, warm it up, and then dump that air into
[16:00.680 --> 16:01.680]  the grow.
[16:01.680 --> 16:03.360]  Again, I don't know your environment.
[16:03.360 --> 16:06.760]  You may not have another space that you can heat up.
[16:06.760 --> 16:08.920]  You say that you've got a space heater in there.
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.160]  Imagine what's going to happen when that cold air and that space heater start colliding,
[16:13.160 --> 16:14.820]  that hot air and that cold air.
[16:14.820 --> 16:20.120]  That's just like when you go outside and you do that thing in the winter and you see steam.
[16:20.120 --> 16:21.920]  You were doing that shit in your grow room.
[16:21.920 --> 16:23.080]  Where's that moisture going to go?
[16:23.080 --> 16:24.440]  It's got to land somewhere.
[16:24.440 --> 16:27.720]  It's going to create powdery mildew conditions in that grow space.
[16:27.720 --> 16:30.400]  You're going to give yourself the option for powdery mildew.
[16:30.400 --> 16:33.880]  Now another thing we really need to think about, if you were just bringing air from
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.080]  outside, what else is coming in with that air?
[16:37.080 --> 16:41.440]  Now it is less likely in the cold winter conditions that you're going to bring in some sort of
[16:41.440 --> 16:47.720]  problems, but there is always the possibility of bringing in a pest or a pathogen.
[16:47.720 --> 16:51.360]  Imagine if you were a bug and you're walking by and it's fucking snowing or it's about
[16:51.360 --> 16:53.480]  to snow and it's cold and the sun's going down.
[16:53.480 --> 16:56.300]  Out of the corner of your eye, what do you see?
[16:56.300 --> 16:59.100]  That bright white glow of a grow light.
[16:59.100 --> 17:00.720]  You know that that's warmth.
[17:00.720 --> 17:01.720]  What are you going to do?
[17:01.720 --> 17:02.720]  You're going to buzz right over there.
[17:03.120 --> 17:06.080]  You're going to fly around the light and then later you're going to get hungry.
[17:06.080 --> 17:07.080]  And what are you going to do?
[17:07.080 --> 17:08.080]  You're going to fly down.
[17:08.080 --> 17:10.120]  You're going to look in those plants for something to eat.
[17:10.120 --> 17:13.520]  Maybe, just maybe that cannabis plant will be the food that you want and you will start
[17:13.520 --> 17:15.080]  munching on it.
[17:15.080 --> 17:16.080]  Then what's going to happen?
[17:16.080 --> 17:20.280]  If you're a little bug, you're nice and full, you're chilling, got a nice warm spot to live,
[17:20.280 --> 17:23.000]  probably going to want to find someone to hang out with, if you know what I mean.
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.280]  So you're going to go on a little quest.
[17:24.280 --> 17:25.960]  You're going to go out that ducting again.
[17:25.960 --> 17:27.480]  You're going to go find some ladies.
[17:27.480 --> 17:29.520]  You're going to bring them back to the warm spot.
[17:29.520 --> 17:30.520]  Then what's going to happen?
[17:30.520 --> 17:33.440]  You're going to make a whole bunch of more bugs and all those bugs are going to go all
[17:33.440 --> 17:34.920]  over those plants.
[17:34.920 --> 17:35.920]  And then guess what?
[17:35.920 --> 17:38.040]  They're going to start making more babies and then you're going to have a whole bunch
[17:38.040 --> 17:39.840]  of bugs all over your plants.
[17:39.840 --> 17:41.680]  So that happens really quickly.
[17:41.680 --> 17:44.240]  That open duct, you've got air coming in.
[17:44.240 --> 17:45.240]  They don't even have to fly.
[17:45.240 --> 17:47.600]  They can just passively float right on in.
[17:47.600 --> 17:49.280]  They're going to get blown on in with the wind.
[17:49.280 --> 17:51.600]  They're like body surfing right into your grow.
[17:51.600 --> 17:57.040]  So if you're going to have a vent coming in, I definitely recommend some sort of a cover
[17:57.040 --> 17:58.480]  on the end of that ducting.
[17:58.480 --> 18:02.360]  I've mentioned on episodes before that I've seen snakes and shit come in through that
[18:02.360 --> 18:03.360]  ducting.
[18:03.360 --> 18:05.200]  I've found lizards in grow rooms.
[18:05.200 --> 18:08.960]  I found weird shit in grows and I'm certain that it came in through that ducting.
[18:08.960 --> 18:10.200]  If not, it was some sort of voodoo.
[18:10.200 --> 18:12.400]  So I really hope it came in through that duct.
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.800]  I would put a very classic move is to put some pantyhose at the end of the duct.
[18:16.800 --> 18:20.960]  It doesn't restrict any airflow and it will stop bugs from getting in.
[18:20.960 --> 18:26.200]  They also sell a really expensive device called the dust shroom or the shroom cover that just
[18:26.200 --> 18:28.040]  goes right at the end of your ducting.
[18:28.040 --> 18:30.600]  That is a very noticeable piece of equipment.
[18:30.600 --> 18:34.520]  If you've got that on your duct, people on the outside will notice that.
[18:34.520 --> 18:39.320]  You can also use the HEPA filters that they sell at Home Depot or your local hardware
[18:39.320 --> 18:40.320]  store.
[18:40.320 --> 18:43.640]  It's just a square and it's a filter and you can cut it to the size you need.
[18:43.640 --> 18:47.440]  I use a staple gun and just staple that right over the hole.
[18:47.440 --> 18:50.800]  Then run that ducting flush right up against the filter, put a little bit of duct tape
[18:50.800 --> 18:51.800]  around it.
[18:51.800 --> 18:54.880]  Then anything that comes in or comes out has to pass through that filter.
[18:54.880 --> 18:56.040]  You can't get any bugs.
[18:56.040 --> 19:00.320]  That will definitely limit the amount of pathogens that can pass through your ducting.
[19:00.320 --> 19:03.880]  Now if you are running that ducting in the winter months and you would like to cool that
[19:03.880 --> 19:09.720]  air, a good idea that you can use is to run that air over your lights.
[19:09.720 --> 19:13.760]  If you've got vented light hoods, if you've got the kind of hoods that have got a duct
[19:13.760 --> 19:18.040]  on each end where you can put ducting in and ducting out, what's to stop you from running
[19:18.040 --> 19:23.640]  that cool air in over one light, over another light to get heated up, then through that
[19:23.640 --> 19:27.680]  blower, then through your shroom cloud so that you're catching any pathogens or any
[19:27.680 --> 19:30.280]  bugs, then into the room.
[19:30.280 --> 19:34.840]  That sounds like a lot of equipment, but if you insist on bringing that cool air in, that
[19:34.840 --> 19:37.200]  is the safest, most efficient way to do it.
[19:37.200 --> 19:38.940]  So let's talk about that again.
[19:38.940 --> 19:40.840]  So you've got your opening for your air intake.
[19:40.840 --> 19:42.520]  I don't know where your air is coming in from.
[19:42.520 --> 19:46.080]  We're just going to say you drilled a four inch hole directly in the wall.
[19:46.080 --> 19:48.160]  So now you've got a four inch hole.
[19:48.160 --> 19:52.680]  On the inside of that wall, I would staple a HIPAA filter just big enough to cover that
[19:52.720 --> 19:55.160]  four inch hole, maybe an inch around each side.
[19:55.320 --> 19:56.760]  Got a little square HIPAA filter.
[19:57.080 --> 20:00.960]  Now I would take the ducting and put it flush against that wall and duct tape it to the
[20:00.960 --> 20:05.120]  wall to where any air has to go right through that filter, right out of the house.
[20:05.440 --> 20:07.720]  Then you run that ducting over to the light.
[20:08.120 --> 20:10.160]  Then you put it at the end of the sealed light duct.
[20:10.360 --> 20:12.880]  Then you put the other ducting at the end of the sealed light duct.
[20:12.880 --> 20:15.000]  And if you've got another light, repeat the process.
[20:15.280 --> 20:16.960]  Repeat for as many lights as you've got.
[20:16.960 --> 20:20.200]  The more, the merrier in this process, because now we're trying to heat up the air and
[20:20.200 --> 20:22.040]  we're going to use the bulbs to do so.
[20:22.600 --> 20:24.400]  So daisy chain those bitches up.
[20:24.760 --> 20:26.560]  Then at the end, you've got your blower.
[20:26.840 --> 20:31.920]  You need your blower blowing toward the air, sucks through all of that ducting into the
[20:31.920 --> 20:34.120]  room. This is a very rare case.
[20:34.120 --> 20:36.200]  Most of the time I want to blow the air out of the room.
[20:36.520 --> 20:39.080]  This time we're sucking the air into the room.
[20:39.520 --> 20:41.080]  Then you've got your four inch blower.
[20:41.280 --> 20:46.320]  At the open end of that, I would put that shroom dust cover so that anything that made
[20:46.320 --> 20:50.920]  it past that HIPAA filter that goes over the lights, goes down the line, does not make
[20:50.920 --> 20:51.720]  it into the grow.
[20:51.720 --> 20:54.280]  It gets caught by that shroom filter.
[20:54.720 --> 20:58.920]  Then in the warmer months, all you have to do is take off that shroom filter and spin
[20:58.920 --> 21:00.000]  your blower around.
[21:00.440 --> 21:03.480]  I would replace the shroom filter with a carbon filter at this point.
[21:03.480 --> 21:07.480]  So now you are going through the carbon filter, through the blower and pushing the air
[21:07.560 --> 21:08.640]  out of the grow room.
[21:08.880 --> 21:11.720]  This will work to remove the heat and remove the humidity.
[21:11.720 --> 21:15.200]  And you've still got your four inch passive duct bringing fresh air in.
[21:15.320 --> 21:19.720]  Again, make sure you put either that shroom cover, a cheap HIPAA filter or even some
[21:19.720 --> 21:22.120]  pantyhose over that so you don't bring any crap in.
[21:22.600 --> 21:27.560]  But this is a very affordable and very effective seasonal grow room adjustment.
[21:27.840 --> 21:31.400]  Being in Canada, you may be able to leave it set up for the cold temperature all the
[21:31.400 --> 21:34.680]  time, but you may need to flip back and forth occasionally.
[21:35.120 --> 21:38.440]  You've already got the four inch blower running a little bit of ducting won't be a
[21:38.440 --> 21:43.240]  challenge. Then all you really need is probably a shroom cover or a HIPAA filter or
[21:43.240 --> 21:47.240]  some pantyhose. And then when you turn it around to blow the air out, I highly
[21:47.240 --> 21:48.680]  recommend a carbon filter.
[21:48.880 --> 21:50.240]  I don't know your location.
[21:50.240 --> 21:51.560]  I don't know your situation.
[21:51.720 --> 21:55.440]  You may be able to just blow that stink air right out of the room and laugh at
[21:55.440 --> 21:57.440]  everybody as they smell your skunky aroma.
[21:57.680 --> 21:59.200]  I don't know if that's acceptable.
[21:59.360 --> 22:02.200]  If not, I certainly recommend the carbon filtration.
[22:02.480 --> 22:06.640]  So the short answer is this is all based on the outside temperature and the
[22:06.720 --> 22:10.320]  temperature of the air, which you plan on bringing into the grow room.
[22:10.520 --> 22:14.280]  If that air is too cold, I would heat it before it enters the room.
[22:14.440 --> 22:17.360]  If that air is the right temperature, go ahead and bring it in.
[22:17.560 --> 22:21.160]  But be sure to filter it in some sort of a way.
[22:21.440 --> 22:23.240]  We really don't want to invite bugs.
[22:23.360 --> 22:25.040]  We don't want to invite problems.
[22:25.200 --> 22:28.800]  And bringing air, we spent all this time and money to build a really nice grow room.
[22:29.040 --> 22:32.200]  And now we're just basically going to knock a hole and invite shit right through
[22:32.200 --> 22:34.160]  that hole. I kind of don't like that idea.
[22:34.160 --> 22:36.480]  So if it is preventable, I would not do that.
[22:36.680 --> 22:40.320]  I understand. Sometimes we are forced to work with what we've got.
[22:41.080 --> 22:43.160]  You mentioned that this grow is in the garage.
[22:43.400 --> 22:47.240]  Instead of running that duct from the outside, can you run that duct into
[22:47.240 --> 22:51.680]  the house? So you're just pulling ambient air from the living area
[22:51.880 --> 22:56.080]  into your grow space because that air in your living area
[22:56.320 --> 23:00.880]  is probably more suitable than that Canadian cold air outside.
[23:01.120 --> 23:05.360]  And it is also probably less likely to contain
[23:05.440 --> 23:06.800]  pests or pathogens.
[23:07.200 --> 23:09.200]  So that is another option that you may explore.
[23:09.440 --> 23:11.720]  Again, I don't know your full situation.
[23:11.760 --> 23:14.320]  Maybe you can't put a duct coming from the house.
[23:14.840 --> 23:19.040]  You could probably make it look very inconspicuous since it's just a four inch
[23:19.040 --> 23:23.440]  duct. If you ran that duct into the house somewhere and maybe put it to where
[23:23.640 --> 23:27.560]  it draws air from either the bathroom or the laundry room or the kitchen area,
[23:27.800 --> 23:32.360]  you could probably disguise it to look like part of the already existing house
[23:32.440 --> 23:36.720]  airflow. It could look like it is a dryer vent or maybe an air conditioning vent
[23:36.720 --> 23:40.000]  that is supposed to be there. Most people won't even notice.
[23:40.240 --> 23:44.040]  Most people that do notice won't suspect it's anything new if it looks like it's
[23:44.040 --> 23:45.960]  supposed to be there. All right.
[23:45.960 --> 23:50.080]  I hope all of those options and all of that input gave you some useful
[23:50.080 --> 23:53.120]  information. I do not recommend blowing that frosty,
[23:53.120 --> 23:57.160]  cold Canadian air across those plants. It will bring out some beautiful colors,
[23:57.400 --> 23:59.960]  but it will give you powdery mildew conditions.
[24:00.160 --> 24:04.960]  Too cold of air blown on the plant will slow your growth rapidly and you just
[24:04.960 --> 24:09.240]  will not be satisfied with the overall condition of your finished product.
[24:09.680 --> 24:12.200]  You did not say if I can use your name in this episode.
