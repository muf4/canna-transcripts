[00:00.000 --> 00:07.320]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[00:07.320 --> 00:13.120]  I'm your host my friends call me Rasta Jeff and this is episode 633 of the grow from your
[00:13.120 --> 00:14.800]  heart podcast.
[00:14.800 --> 00:17.960]  In this episode I'm going to read a couple of Patreon messages.
[00:17.960 --> 00:22.040]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 club.
[00:22.040 --> 00:27.160]  Of course the 710 club are those folks who support us on Patreon at the $7 and 10 cent
[00:27.160 --> 00:28.800]  a month level or higher.
[00:28.800 --> 00:31.000]  So with no further ado, let's kick it off.

[01:41.260 --> 01:42.300]  Maybe you're at work.
[01:42.300 --> 01:43.980]  Maybe you're chasing the kids around.
[01:43.980 --> 01:46.660]  Maybe you're hanging out with the lady and got this in one earbud acting like you're
[01:46.660 --> 01:47.660]  paying attention.
[01:47.660 --> 01:50.260]  I don't know what you're doing but don't get yourself in trouble.
[01:50.260 --> 01:52.220]  The link will be there when you've got time.
[01:52.220 --> 01:57.420]  It's patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:57.420 --> 02:02.320]  I want to start off by thanking everybody for the tremendous response to the release
[02:02.320 --> 02:04.520]  of the blueberry butcher strain.
[02:04.520 --> 02:06.000]  You guys blew my mind.
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.880]  It sold out in two different websites.
[02:07.880 --> 02:12.020]  I had to restock them two different times and then it sold out again.
[02:12.020 --> 02:14.080]  That went super quickly.
[02:14.080 --> 02:15.080]  There will be a restock.
[02:15.080 --> 02:17.560]  I've got a few more packs of those to put together and get them out.
[02:17.560 --> 02:21.240]  I did not expect to sell as many packs as I did that quickly.
[02:21.240 --> 02:22.240]  Thank you.
[02:22.240 --> 02:23.240]  Thank you.
[02:23.240 --> 02:24.240]  I do appreciate it.
[02:24.540 --> 02:28.420]  If you missed the blueberry butcher episode, I highly recommend you go back and check that
[02:28.420 --> 02:30.380]  out when there are more seeds available.
[02:30.380 --> 02:32.860]  There will be more seeds very soon.
[02:32.860 --> 02:36.100]  That is something I'm going to have to make a lot of once again.
[02:36.100 --> 02:37.100]  Pay attention.
[02:37.100 --> 02:40.380]  There's a few more to get out so there will be a restock but grab those while you can.
[02:40.380 --> 02:42.940]  If you don't get them on the restock, they will be made again.
[02:42.940 --> 02:47.000]  Once again, you guys, I'm high and rambly but thank you for the support on the blueberry
[02:47.000 --> 02:48.940]  butcher release on 420.
[02:48.940 --> 02:51.180]  Big shout out to seedsherenow.com.
[02:51.180 --> 02:54.800]  Also chitownseeds.com for just killing it on 420.
[02:54.800 --> 02:55.800]  All right.
[02:55.800 --> 02:57.320]  Where do we go from there?
[02:57.320 --> 02:58.960]  Main topics of the show.
[02:58.960 --> 03:01.560]  You know I like to answer questions from Patreon.
[03:01.560 --> 03:04.680]  The Patreon supporters, their questions get moved to the top of the list.
[03:04.680 --> 03:06.400]  I've been slacking on Patreon questions.
[03:06.400 --> 03:10.760]  We had a lot of holiday stuff to get through and then I got distracted by 420.
[03:10.760 --> 03:14.960]  I am back in the swing of Patreon questions.
[03:14.960 --> 03:16.360]  Let's jump right into this first one.
[03:16.360 --> 03:18.600]  This is a great question for a cannabis breeder.
[03:18.600 --> 03:21.120]  It goes a lot like this.
[03:21.140 --> 03:22.900]  This one came from my friend AllMixedUp.
[03:22.900 --> 03:23.900]  Shout out to AllMixedUp.
[03:23.900 --> 03:24.900]  Bro, you do great work.
[03:24.900 --> 03:28.500]  I love looking at your photos on Cannabis on Instagram, on social media.
[03:28.500 --> 03:31.860]  You have a really good eye for where to take the shot.
[03:31.860 --> 03:33.900]  Your plants look good so you've got good subjects.
[03:33.900 --> 03:34.900]  You got good framing.
[03:34.900 --> 03:38.540]  It kind of looks like you might have learned from me to be honest but I'm not going to
[03:38.540 --> 03:41.700]  give myself credit for that but it looks like shots I would have fucking taken, dude.
[03:41.700 --> 03:43.580]  So good damn job.
[03:43.580 --> 03:45.580]  Also very good tester work.
[03:45.580 --> 03:48.300]  When I send you tester seeds, you do a damn good job with those also.
[03:48.300 --> 03:50.620]  So shout out to my friend AllMixedUp.
[03:51.120 --> 03:54.120]  I'm going to get into the message because it goes a lot like this.
[03:54.120 --> 03:55.720]  Ross to Jeff, I've got a question.
[03:55.720 --> 03:57.400]  Bro, I have got answers.
[03:57.400 --> 04:01.080]  But it says, before I ask my questions, I just want to say thank you for all that you
[04:01.080 --> 04:02.080]  do, bro.
[04:02.080 --> 04:03.080]  Bro, thank you.
[04:03.080 --> 04:04.080]  It is a symbiosis.
[04:04.080 --> 04:05.080]  It's a team effort.
[04:05.080 --> 04:09.000]  I may be the team captain but without a captain of the team, without a team, the captain is
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  just a fucking egomaniac.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.240]  So I'm glad that I've got a bunch of people that listen and learn and appreciate and respect
[04:14.240 --> 04:16.440]  me and the feeling is mutual.
[04:16.440 --> 04:19.080]  I appreciate, I learn and I respect you guys just as much.
[04:19.080 --> 04:23.140]  I get a lot of feedback from you that teaches me as much as I feel like I teach you.
[04:23.140 --> 04:24.360]  So the feeling is mutual.
[04:24.360 --> 04:25.500]  Thank you guys.
[04:25.500 --> 04:27.580]  Not just my friend AllMixedUp but the whole army.
[04:27.580 --> 04:28.580]  Thank you.
[04:28.580 --> 04:29.580]  I learn from everybody.
[04:29.580 --> 04:33.460]  A good teacher once taught me that you can learn something from everybody.
[04:33.460 --> 04:36.820]  As a musician, I learned I can learn something from everybody.
[04:36.820 --> 04:42.420]  I've heard brand new musicians that have no idea what they're doing pull off the coolest
[04:42.420 --> 04:46.580]  licks on a guitar, play the freshest fills on the drums because they're the most creative.
[04:46.580 --> 04:47.860]  They don't know the rules.
[04:47.860 --> 04:48.860]  They just did some shit.
[04:49.640 --> 04:52.480]  I learned something from that little kid in the guitar center fucking drum room who just
[04:52.480 --> 04:54.360]  did this thing and I was blown away.
[04:54.360 --> 04:56.680]  Put it into my repertoire as a professional drummer.
[04:56.680 --> 04:57.960]  So I learned from everybody.
[04:57.960 --> 05:00.800]  I can learn something from anybody on the planet.
[05:00.800 --> 05:02.500]  Everybody's got something to teach me.
[05:02.500 --> 05:05.080]  So I learned from you guys as much as you learned from me.
[05:05.080 --> 05:08.680]  I need to learn to stay focused because I'm rambling as shit today.
[05:08.680 --> 05:13.600]  Anyway, thank you, Ro, for recognizing my hard work and my dedication to this industry,
[05:13.600 --> 05:17.600]  this community, this craft, this lifestyle where I'm fucking in it to win it at this
[05:17.600 --> 05:18.600]  point.
[05:19.340 --> 05:20.340]  I'm not gonna do that.
[05:20.340 --> 05:21.340]  This is what I'm doing.
[05:21.340 --> 05:25.080]  So anyway, it says, bro, my question goes like this.
[05:25.080 --> 05:30.160]  I have a white widow plant, which I've been growing for 20 plus years.
[05:30.160 --> 05:32.760]  I bet that's a badass plant, dude.
[05:32.760 --> 05:35.000]  Old school white widow was fire.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.180]  And then if you've chosen to keep it around for 20 years, it has got to be the heat that
[05:39.180 --> 05:40.680]  has got to be a gem.
[05:40.680 --> 05:45.620]  It says I keep a mother plant in veg for around six months to a year before taking a couple
[05:45.620 --> 05:48.880]  healthy clones, then sending her into flower.
[05:48.880 --> 05:49.880]  That's what a lot of us do.
[05:49.880 --> 05:52.100]  I keep a mother plant around for about six months.
[05:52.100 --> 05:54.820]  And then I chop the mother plant into a bunch of clones.
[05:54.820 --> 05:58.860]  I flower out the some of the clones and I keep one of the really good ones, but not
[05:58.860 --> 05:59.860]  the best.
[05:59.860 --> 06:01.100]  Of course, the best goes to the flower room.
[06:01.100 --> 06:05.060]  I keep one of the like the top three as my new mother plant so I can just keep refreshing
[06:05.060 --> 06:10.140]  that genetic every three, six, usually about six months, sometimes nine months to a year,
[06:10.140 --> 06:11.300]  depending on how the plant grows.
[06:11.300 --> 06:13.500]  If it's the Mac, you only need to do it once a year.
[06:13.500 --> 06:15.300]  If it's a rise, you got to do it three times a year.
[06:15.300 --> 06:17.140]  Just depends on the speed of the plant.
[06:17.140 --> 06:19.220]  So our friend has a white widow plant.
[06:19.220 --> 06:20.220]  They keep a mother plant.
[06:20.220 --> 06:24.580]  They cut some clones, send it to flower, and then they keep the mother plant around.
[06:24.580 --> 06:27.140]  Now the question is, would it be possible?
[06:27.140 --> 06:28.540]  And they actually typed, is it be possible?
[06:28.540 --> 06:29.660]  And I like that.
[06:29.660 --> 06:33.660]  Is it be possible to make seeds of her to keep her around instead of always keeping
[06:33.660 --> 06:36.780]  a mom plant around taking up space?
[06:36.780 --> 06:41.420]  So our friend does not want to keep the mother plant around and they want to make some seeds
[06:41.420 --> 06:42.440]  of this plant.
[06:42.440 --> 06:44.840]  So the mother plant is not always taking up space.
[06:44.840 --> 06:48.320]  The first thing I would recommend is just little tiny bonsai mother plants.
[06:48.320 --> 06:49.320]  Cut a clone.
[06:49.320 --> 06:50.320]  As soon as it gets too big, cut a clone of that.
[06:50.320 --> 06:51.840]  And as soon as it gets too big, cut a clone of that.
[06:51.840 --> 06:53.840]  And just always have a little tiny one.
[06:53.840 --> 06:57.200]  Little tiny, tiny mother plant would be an option, but that's not what you asked.
[06:57.200 --> 06:58.320]  You asked about seeds.
[06:58.320 --> 07:03.280]  Yes, it would be very possible, very viable to make seeds of this plant.
[07:03.280 --> 07:05.440]  I would just make S1s, self seeds.
[07:05.440 --> 07:07.200]  We'll talk more in detail about that in a minute.
[07:07.200 --> 07:11.340]  I want to wrap up the letter and then I'll get myself on a good rant talking about making
[07:11.340 --> 07:13.560]  seeds of this plant.
[07:13.560 --> 07:17.640]  Would you recommend going this route by making seeds of this Pheno or just keep doing it
[07:17.640 --> 07:19.020]  the way I have been doing it?
[07:19.020 --> 07:20.660]  Bro, your way works.
[07:20.660 --> 07:22.020]  You don't have to keep a mother plant.
[07:22.020 --> 07:26.900]  You can have a large veg plant going and as soon as you put it in a flower, cut a clone
[07:26.900 --> 07:30.220]  of it and then let that one keep growing as the next veg plant.
[07:30.220 --> 07:34.140]  You never have a mother plant per se, but you've always got a healthy plant and veg
[07:34.140 --> 07:36.100]  that you can get a clone from.
[07:36.100 --> 07:39.780]  And then maybe wait seven to 10 days before you flip it to make sure you're going to get
[07:39.780 --> 07:42.140]  a clone and then maybe take too many clones.
[07:42.140 --> 07:44.820]  Just I don't know your clone skill, but you don't have to keep a mother plant.
[07:44.820 --> 07:49.940]  You can have a veg plant that is a clone donor as well and then flower it and then keep doing
[07:49.940 --> 07:50.940]  that.
[07:50.940 --> 07:52.980]  So you have one that is a veg plant that goes into flower, one's a veg plant that goes into
[07:52.980 --> 07:53.980]  flower.
[07:53.980 --> 07:57.700]  You can do that, but that's a real easy process.
[07:57.700 --> 07:59.180]  You want to think about making seeds.
[07:59.180 --> 08:02.260]  That's the part where I'm going to focus because I'm known as being a seed breeder.
[08:02.260 --> 08:07.340]  I think the keeping a veg plant and not having a mother plant, I think you can understand
[08:07.340 --> 08:09.220]  how to move that into the process.
[08:09.220 --> 08:12.580]  Just take the mother plant you've got, consider that a veg plant.
[08:12.580 --> 08:16.060]  When it's time to get clones, take three, five, 10 clones from it, flower it.
[08:16.060 --> 08:17.100]  I think that's what you're doing.
[08:17.100 --> 08:19.540]  So you figured out that process.
[08:19.540 --> 08:24.860]  Let's talk about making seeds because that is where my area of expertise does lie.
[08:24.860 --> 08:26.580]  It does wrap it up with, thanks, Ross to Jeff.
[08:26.580 --> 08:27.700]  Hey, thank you all mixed up.
[08:27.700 --> 08:31.220]  I appreciate the feedback, the input and the great question here.
[08:31.220 --> 08:32.220]  Here is my answer.
[08:32.220 --> 08:37.200]  If you want to make a preservation seeds of this strain so that you've got it forever,
[08:37.200 --> 08:38.760]  this is what I would do.
[08:38.800 --> 08:42.580]  And this would work for, maybe you just don't want to keep this strain around.
[08:42.580 --> 08:43.580]  Maybe you've got it.
[08:43.580 --> 08:46.380]  Maybe you want to go on vacation and simply just not grow for a minute, but you want to
[08:46.380 --> 08:50.180]  come back and have a reliable stock of something to work with.
[08:50.180 --> 08:53.840]  Maybe you just want to move and you can't move the plants with you or however you want
[08:53.840 --> 08:56.180]  to preserve this forever in seed form.
[08:56.180 --> 08:58.380]  This is how I would do it.
[08:58.380 --> 09:04.540]  I would reverse the plant to keep it pure and use that plant as the pollen donor and
[09:04.540 --> 09:06.680]  the female plant, the pollen receiver.
[09:06.700 --> 09:08.500]  That way we're not adulterating it.
[09:08.500 --> 09:13.780]  For this to happen, you've got to make feminized S1 selfed seeds.
[09:13.780 --> 09:18.140]  So you're going to cut one clone and that will be selected as your pollen donor.
[09:18.140 --> 09:20.660]  It's a female right now, but we're going to make it give you pollen.
[09:20.660 --> 09:21.660]  Don't worry.
[09:21.660 --> 09:23.740]  Then I would cut two or three other clones.
[09:23.740 --> 09:26.940]  Those will be the pollen receivers that are going to make you seeds.
[09:26.940 --> 09:28.020]  They'll receive the pollen.
[09:28.020 --> 09:29.640]  The seeds will come from them.
[09:29.640 --> 09:32.380]  So you've got your pollen giver.
[09:32.380 --> 09:33.460]  They all look the same right now.
[09:33.460 --> 09:35.260]  They're all clones of that white widow plant.
[09:35.280 --> 09:38.640]  They all look the same, but we're going to take one and we're going to treat it with
[09:38.640 --> 09:40.280]  silver thiosulfate.
[09:40.280 --> 09:43.460]  I've done a full episode on silver thiosulfate.
[09:43.460 --> 09:46.940]  I've done a full episode on making feminized seeds.
[09:46.940 --> 09:52.160]  With those two episodes together, you should be able to get at least a good headstart,
[09:52.160 --> 09:54.480]  a good blueprint on how to make fem seeds.
[09:54.480 --> 09:59.440]  You may need to hit me up for details, questions, maybe search the internet for some fine details,
[09:59.440 --> 10:00.440]  some fine tuning.
[10:00.440 --> 10:04.960]  But I think with what I gave you, you should be able to make, you should be able to find
[10:04.960 --> 10:06.220]  and make the silver thiosulfate.
[10:06.220 --> 10:12.340]  Then you should be able to execute the process of reversing the plant, pollinating the pollen
[10:12.340 --> 10:16.380]  receiver plants and creating seeds out of that.
[10:16.380 --> 10:17.980]  I know who you are.
[10:17.980 --> 10:21.060]  I know you listen well, and I know you can do this.
[10:21.060 --> 10:24.980]  I know you've got the knowledge already from listening to the show to do this.
[10:24.980 --> 10:26.860]  So I would reverse it.
[10:26.860 --> 10:27.980]  That way you keep it pure.
[10:27.980 --> 10:30.980]  That way when you come back to these seeds, it is unadulterated.
[10:30.980 --> 10:33.260]  It is just your white widow plant.
[10:33.260 --> 10:37.520]  Any other way of crossing this plant to make seeds would adulterate it.
[10:37.520 --> 10:42.920]  If you took another male plant and pollinated that female, you're making a new F1 cross.
[10:42.920 --> 10:48.080]  It's going to be something white widow to arise, white widow to strawberry starburst,
[10:48.080 --> 10:51.200]  white widow to whatever other male plant you used.
[10:51.200 --> 10:53.160]  So when you grow it, it's not going to be your white widow.
[10:53.160 --> 10:56.160]  It's going to be adulterated.
[10:56.160 --> 10:57.920]  Excuse the kombucha burps.
[10:57.920 --> 10:59.920]  Anyway, I would reverse it.
[10:59.920 --> 11:01.120]  That way you're keeping it pure.
[11:01.120 --> 11:02.280]  It is still white widow.
[11:02.300 --> 11:07.660]  You're going to find a little bit of phenotypical variation, but within five or six seeds, maybe
[11:07.660 --> 11:12.340]  10 seeds, you'll definitely find that phenotype that looks just like the one you started with
[11:12.340 --> 11:13.780]  that you reversed.
[11:13.780 --> 11:16.880]  So cut two or more clones.
[11:16.880 --> 11:20.340]  You're going to need one as a pollen donor, one as a pollen receiver.
[11:20.340 --> 11:24.780]  I would, in my scenario, I would do two or three as the pollen giver and like six as
[11:24.780 --> 11:30.360]  the receiver because I would reverse the other three at different spray intervals and ratios
[11:30.360 --> 11:31.780]  to learn that plant.
[11:31.780 --> 11:34.280]  And then I don't know how well the others are going to receive pollen.
[11:34.280 --> 11:37.400]  I would make sure that I got enough plants to receive pollen.
[11:37.400 --> 11:40.600]  I'm just extra careful when it comes to reversing and pollinating.
[11:40.600 --> 11:41.920]  That's also my career.
[11:41.920 --> 11:44.080]  So I got to rely on that.
[11:44.080 --> 11:47.120]  So cut two or more clones, reverse one.
[11:47.120 --> 11:51.080]  Like I said before, you've got the knowledge in your head already from listening to my
[11:51.080 --> 11:56.680]  show how to make silver thiosulfate, how and when to apply it to the plant, how to fucking
[11:56.680 --> 12:00.560]  make that plant create pollen sacks and put that pollen on the girls.
[12:00.560 --> 12:01.560]  You know how to do that.
[12:02.340 --> 12:04.660]  If you don't message me, I'll get you through it.
[12:04.660 --> 12:08.380]  So reverse one plant, pollinate one or more, and then wait.
[12:08.380 --> 12:12.660]  All you got to do is wait, then harvest the seeds, then store those seeds.
[12:12.660 --> 12:15.900]  They should be nice and hard and tiger striped or at least dark brown when you pull them
[12:15.900 --> 12:20.900]  out, let them dry really hard, then store them with all of your other seeds, well labeled.
[12:20.900 --> 12:21.900]  And guess what?
[12:21.900 --> 12:26.100]  You've now got reserve stock of your white widow and they're feminized also.
[12:26.100 --> 12:27.880]  So you're not going to find boys in there.
[12:27.880 --> 12:28.880]  So that's going to help you out.
[12:28.880 --> 12:32.820]  You're not able to breed with that unless you do more reversals or find a different
[12:32.820 --> 12:33.820]  male.
[12:33.820 --> 12:35.220]  It can't be a male for breeding.
[12:35.220 --> 12:39.300]  I'm going to press pause, take a drink and catch my breath and we'll wrap this question
[12:39.300 --> 12:40.300]  up and move forward.
[12:40.300 --> 12:41.460]  All right, I am back.
[12:41.460 --> 12:42.460]  I'm well hydrated.
[12:42.460 --> 12:43.460]  I'm well medicated.
[12:43.460 --> 12:45.460]  I'm ready to ramble on.
[12:45.460 --> 12:49.060]  I think I pretty much answered this question about preservation.
[12:49.060 --> 12:54.060]  Cut a few clones, reverse one, pollinate, make seeds, harvest the seeds, dry them and
[12:54.060 --> 12:55.060]  store them.
[12:55.060 --> 12:58.720]  And then when it comes time to grow this again, you have got it.
[12:59.560 --> 13:03.380]  The hardest part about this project, in my opinion, and many people are probably going
[13:03.380 --> 13:09.140]  to agree with me, is cutting down the plant you've kept for 20 years.
[13:09.140 --> 13:11.360]  Making fem seeds out of it, that's just a process.
[13:11.360 --> 13:14.180]  That's a standard operating procedure.
[13:14.180 --> 13:18.340]  Cutting down a plant that you've been attached to for 20 years is going to feel strange inside.
[13:18.340 --> 13:22.740]  And if it wasn't before, now that I've mentioned it, it is certainly going to make you feel
[13:22.740 --> 13:24.780]  some type of way.
[13:24.780 --> 13:26.380]  That's the part that's going to be the real challenge here.
[13:26.400 --> 13:30.960]  There's no SOP for detachment, for cutting down a plant you've been in love with for
[13:30.960 --> 13:32.520]  20 years.
[13:32.520 --> 13:35.640]  I recently let go of my flow plant.
[13:35.640 --> 13:36.640]  There was nothing wrong with flow.
[13:36.640 --> 13:40.120]  I had flow for 12 years, 13 years.
[13:40.120 --> 13:42.160]  I honestly just got bored with it.
[13:42.160 --> 13:43.160]  I bred to it.
[13:43.160 --> 13:44.160]  I grew it.
[13:44.160 --> 13:45.160]  I smoked it.
[13:45.160 --> 13:46.160]  I bred it to everything.
[13:46.160 --> 13:49.720]  And it was a great plant, but it just wasn't, I don't know, it was like a 7 out of a 10.
[13:49.720 --> 13:51.760]  And I like 11s.
[13:51.760 --> 13:53.140]  So it had to go.
[13:53.560 --> 13:59.240]  That plant was around through my evolution as a grower, as a breeder, as like a basement
[13:59.240 --> 14:02.180]  buccaneer to a commercial grower.
[14:02.180 --> 14:03.180]  That flow was around.
[14:03.180 --> 14:05.060]  That flow paid a lot of bills.
[14:05.060 --> 14:07.300]  That flow paid a lot of favors.
[14:07.300 --> 14:09.460]  That flow paved a lot of ways.
[14:09.460 --> 14:13.020]  I would wake up and smell that plant and it would make me nauseous because I had been
[14:13.020 --> 14:18.300]  around it, grew it, smelled it, smoked it, sold it for so long that it had to go.
[14:18.300 --> 14:21.700]  So maybe you're done with this white widow, but obviously you're not done done.
[14:22.020 --> 14:24.780]  It's like a girl you want to break up with, but you still keep her number in your phone.
[14:24.780 --> 14:26.420]  You're like, I ain't done yet.
[14:26.420 --> 14:27.660]  Making these fem seeds out of her.
[14:27.660 --> 14:30.940]  Anyway, I'm rambling, but the hardest part is going to be getting rid of this plant.
[14:30.940 --> 14:34.040]  You can make all the seeds you want, cut all the clones you want.
[14:34.040 --> 14:35.220]  Good luck when it's time to cut it down.
[14:35.220 --> 14:36.220]  You're going to get shaky.
[14:36.220 --> 14:37.300]  It's going to be fun.
[14:37.300 --> 14:38.560]  Make a video.
[14:38.560 --> 14:39.820]  Make a video when you do it.
[14:39.820 --> 14:41.060]  Bro, thank you for the great message.
[14:41.060 --> 14:42.180]  That was a really good question.
[14:42.180 --> 14:43.740]  I hope I answered it thoroughly.
[14:43.740 --> 14:47.660]  I know I keep saying that you've got the information to do the reversal because I know you're a
[14:47.660 --> 14:48.820]  smart person.
[14:48.820 --> 14:51.620]  If you need help, if you need guidance, you know, I know who you are.
[14:51.660 --> 14:52.660]  You know who I am.
[14:52.660 --> 14:54.420]  You know, all you have to do is ask me for help.
[14:54.420 --> 14:57.100]  Say, all right, I'm ready to do the reversal.
[14:57.100 --> 14:58.100]  What do I do?
[14:58.100 --> 14:59.620]  You know, I'll guide you through it if you need help.
[14:59.620 --> 15:00.620]  All right.
[15:00.620 --> 15:01.620]  Big shout out to my buddy, AllMixedUp.
[15:01.620 --> 15:07.620]  I need to keep moving because I'm awful rambly on this podcast.
[15:07.620 --> 15:11.860]  This message came from Patreon, patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[15:11.860 --> 15:15.660]  It is from our friend Sticky Randy, and it goes a lot like this.
[15:15.660 --> 15:17.900]  It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, here's a good question for you.
[15:17.900 --> 15:24.420]  What kind of notes should I take while doing a breeding pheno hunt for males and female
[15:24.420 --> 15:25.820]  plants?
[15:25.820 --> 15:27.660]  That's a really good question.
[15:27.660 --> 15:30.980]  And honestly, it's kind of up to you.
[15:30.980 --> 15:34.180]  That's a very vague, shitty answer, but what are you interested in?
[15:34.180 --> 15:35.620]  What do you care about?
[15:35.620 --> 15:38.680]  The main things I look for are germination ratios.
[15:38.680 --> 15:42.900]  I'm not sure if you're asking me like, you're doing a breeding pheno hunt for males and
[15:42.900 --> 15:43.900]  females.
[15:43.900 --> 15:47.460]  So, are you looking for males to use in the breeding?
[15:48.020 --> 15:52.540]  I'm not sure what exactly you're asking, but for notes for taking, I always take notes
[15:52.540 --> 15:54.020]  on germination rates.
[15:54.020 --> 15:57.700]  How many sprout, throw a hundred seeds in a paper towel and see how many of them pop.
[15:57.700 --> 15:59.060]  Write that down.
[15:59.060 --> 16:00.060]  That's my germination ratio.
[16:00.060 --> 16:01.500]  It's a really easy number to get.
[16:01.500 --> 16:03.500]  It's a real easy number to math up.
[16:03.500 --> 16:05.020]  It's a really good number to have.
[16:05.020 --> 16:07.660]  So that's where I start germination ratios.
[16:07.660 --> 16:10.480]  Then how many of those made it out of the dirt?
[16:10.480 --> 16:12.220]  How many of them were males and females?
[16:12.220 --> 16:13.340]  How many looked like shit?
[16:13.340 --> 16:15.060]  How many were vigorous?
[16:15.060 --> 16:18.340]  All of my plants are labeled with a number and or a letter.
[16:18.340 --> 16:22.820]  If something stands out, any sort of anomaly gets written down.
[16:22.820 --> 16:24.940]  Anything you notice gets written down.
[16:24.940 --> 16:25.980]  That's how I do it.
[16:25.980 --> 16:27.540]  I don't know what you're interested in.
[16:27.540 --> 16:33.300]  As a breeder, I want to see growth structure at certain times, how it responds to certain
[16:33.300 --> 16:35.860]  things I do to it.
[16:35.860 --> 16:40.160]  If I fed it recharge, did it over get too, did it absorb too much nitrogen?
[16:40.160 --> 16:44.860]  Because sometimes if you feed it too much recharge, it'll make it cycle too quickly.
[16:45.660 --> 16:48.860]  When I gave it cow mag, did the leaves get real serrated or did it start to get pale
[16:48.860 --> 16:51.100]  on me because I overfed it?
[16:51.100 --> 16:53.780]  I write down notes like that, things that I notice.
[16:53.780 --> 16:57.860]  I write down every feed, everything I mix up.
[16:57.860 --> 17:02.900]  So if I've got a 25 gallon, we'll say a 20 gallon reservoir, it's easier to do math.
[17:02.900 --> 17:09.060]  If I do a 20 gallon reservoir, I write down that I put 60 mils of this product in there,
[17:09.060 --> 17:13.260]  120 mils of this product in there, 10 mils of this product in there.
[17:13.860 --> 17:17.180]  As I pour it in, it's a Google document, honestly, in my phone.
[17:17.180 --> 17:21.260]  So I just open it up and I type 60, I pour in 60, then go to the next product, type in
[17:21.260 --> 17:26.700]  Equinox 120, pour in the 120 of Equinox, 74 grams of Shine.
[17:26.700 --> 17:28.700]  That's just a fucking wild exaggeration.
[17:28.700 --> 17:29.900]  I'm just making up numbers now.
[17:29.900 --> 17:32.100]  But put a bunch of Shine in there, stir it up.
[17:32.100 --> 17:33.340]  Then guess what I do next?
[17:33.340 --> 17:35.540]  I measure the pH, I measure the EC.
[17:35.540 --> 17:36.540]  Guess what I do then?
[17:36.540 --> 17:38.740]  I write those down in a Google document.
[17:38.780 --> 17:44.100]  I've got Google documents for the pH, the EC, the feed, and the runoff in and out for
[17:44.100 --> 17:46.500]  the past fucking six years of my grow.
[17:46.500 --> 17:50.580]  So if I come up with any issues, scroll through, I've got a good guideline of what might have
[17:50.580 --> 17:51.580]  happened.
[17:51.580 --> 17:52.580]  So those are notes I take.
[17:52.580 --> 17:58.420]  You're asking about breeding, internodal structure, how far apart are the nodes?
[17:58.420 --> 18:04.220]  Do you have like a criteria in your head that you say, these branches are squatty, these
[18:04.220 --> 18:10.540]  branches are sturdy, these branches are stretchy, these branches are twisty, this plant has
[18:10.540 --> 18:14.500]  a Christmas tree structure, this plant has a fern-like stretch.
[18:14.500 --> 18:19.460]  Like do you have something, even if it's just a guideline or a bracket system in your own
[18:19.460 --> 18:26.020]  head, do you have something like that to compare the plants to in your own head?
[18:26.020 --> 18:29.500]  So whatever you find important is what's important for your grow notes.
[18:29.500 --> 18:31.540]  What are you looking for?
[18:31.540 --> 18:39.060]  Structure, appearance, leaf size, leaf shape, germination rates, growth rates, aroma, rub
[18:39.060 --> 18:43.060]  the stems, give it a smell, rub the leaves, give it a smell.
[18:43.060 --> 18:44.220]  Are the leaves perking up?
[18:44.220 --> 18:45.900]  Are the leaves drooping?
[18:45.900 --> 18:50.580]  Are there 10 plants in the room and one of them is doing something different?
[18:50.580 --> 18:51.580]  Write that down.
[18:51.580 --> 18:53.700]  Whatever that one plant is doing, write it down.
[18:53.700 --> 18:56.980]  Also stand near that plant and look around.
[18:56.980 --> 18:58.940]  Is the air conditioner blowing on that plant?
[18:58.940 --> 19:00.540]  Is the heater blowing on that plant?
[19:00.540 --> 19:03.620]  Is the humidifier extra humidifying that plant?
[19:03.620 --> 19:05.380]  Is it right under one of the lights?
[19:05.380 --> 19:08.180]  Is it right far away from one of the lights?
[19:08.180 --> 19:13.900]  That's the shit I write down because the scientific method requires all of the data we can get.
[19:13.900 --> 19:19.180]  If you say, I've got 10 plants and this one over here is growing real tall, that must
[19:19.180 --> 19:20.580]  be the best plant.
[19:20.580 --> 19:23.060]  What if the light's right there and we don't know that?
[19:23.060 --> 19:27.180]  And we pick that plant and we take that plant to our facility and fill the entire facility
[19:27.260 --> 19:31.580]  with that one plant and it doesn't perform the way it did in that one situation because
[19:31.580 --> 19:33.540]  it was right next to the fucking light.
[19:33.540 --> 19:36.900]  Or it was right by the heater and it loved that heat and we don't know that that one
[19:36.900 --> 19:38.140]  plant got the heater.
[19:38.140 --> 19:42.540]  So if there's no scientific method to that, unless you write down every detail that you
[19:42.540 --> 19:50.820]  can see, also details we cannot see, humidity, temperature, VPD, anything you can think of,
[19:50.820 --> 19:53.940]  write all of that shit down.
[19:53.940 --> 19:57.900]  In a commercial environment, one of the things I like the guys to do, guys and gals, now
[19:57.900 --> 20:02.900]  there are lots of lovely, excellent ladies working in the commercial facilities.
[20:02.900 --> 20:08.180]  When you walk in and out of a commercial grow room, I have you write down the VPD, the temperature
[20:08.180 --> 20:10.220]  and humidity on a little chart.
[20:10.220 --> 20:13.860]  Just it gives us accountability, also makes you look.
[20:13.860 --> 20:16.660]  That way you walk in the room, you check the meters.
[20:16.660 --> 20:18.420]  Sometimes you get complacent in a grow.
[20:18.420 --> 20:22.820]  Sometimes the staff is busy thinking about task A and they get colorblind or they get
[20:22.820 --> 20:24.220]  the blinders on, what's it called?
[20:24.220 --> 20:26.980]  Tunnel vision is the word I'm looking for, and they can't focus.
[20:26.980 --> 20:31.020]  So they just walk right in there and they don't realize that the room is super humid
[20:31.020 --> 20:34.580]  because they're going in there just to find that pair of scissors at the end of that hallway,
[20:34.580 --> 20:37.860]  at the end of that fucking grow table, and they don't realize it's super humid.
[20:37.860 --> 20:42.180]  So when they walk in there every time, they got to look at the monitor, write down the
[20:42.180 --> 20:45.180]  VPD, the temperature and the humidity and initial it.
[20:45.180 --> 20:49.380]  And that way I know the last time that Mark came in here, Mark is a made up name.
[20:49.380 --> 20:50.700]  Don't yell at Mark for fucking up.
[20:50.780 --> 20:53.860]  The last time Mark came in here, he looked at the VPD and it was cool.
[20:53.860 --> 20:54.940]  That was two hours ago.
[20:54.940 --> 20:55.940]  I'm in here.
[20:55.940 --> 20:56.940]  It's fucked up.
[20:56.940 --> 20:59.140]  Something happened when the last hour and a half we got to figure out.
[20:59.140 --> 21:02.620]  Go look at the cameras, go look at the charts, look at the plants, figure out what went wrong
[21:02.620 --> 21:03.620]  in the room.
[21:03.620 --> 21:04.900]  Is the dehumidifier broken?
[21:04.900 --> 21:06.260]  Is the air conditioner stuck on?
[21:06.260 --> 21:09.060]  Is one of the blowers in the room stuck somewhere?
[21:09.060 --> 21:10.360]  That's when we started investigating.
[21:10.360 --> 21:12.820]  So every little detail, make notes.
[21:12.820 --> 21:15.700]  That way you can find the problems.
[21:15.700 --> 21:18.060]  Every it's like a murder investigation.
[21:18.060 --> 21:20.780]  The more shit you know, the easier it is to solve the crime.
[21:20.780 --> 21:24.740]  And a lot of times when you find a problem in the grow, it's like a big old who done
[21:24.740 --> 21:25.740]  it.
[21:25.740 --> 21:26.740]  Do we have spider mites?
[21:26.740 --> 21:27.740]  Is it too cold in here?
[21:27.740 --> 21:28.740]  Is it too hot in here?
[21:28.740 --> 21:29.740]  How's the VPD?
[21:29.740 --> 21:31.060]  All of that shit's going to go through your mind.
[21:31.060 --> 21:34.700]  The minute you see an issue in the grow, you're going to go, Oh, what did I feed it last time?
[21:34.700 --> 21:36.500]  Did you spray it anything?
[21:36.500 --> 21:40.500]  And if I'm a consultant and I come to your grow to help you out, those are the questions
[21:40.500 --> 21:41.660]  I'm going to ask.
[21:41.660 --> 21:43.300]  Did you spray anything?
[21:43.300 --> 21:45.160]  What was the last thing you sprayed?
[21:45.160 --> 21:46.400]  How many days ago?
[21:46.400 --> 21:48.800]  And then what was the product you sprayed before that?
[21:48.800 --> 21:52.560]  Because let's see if those two products are having a reaction on your leaf surface.
[21:52.560 --> 21:54.160]  That could be fucking everything up.
[21:54.160 --> 21:56.680]  We may solve the problem just by looking at paperwork.
[21:56.680 --> 21:59.080]  We may not have to leave the office.
[21:59.080 --> 22:03.640]  Maybe you could have saved yourself half of the consulting fee by doing it over zoom and
[22:03.640 --> 22:05.640]  not making me drive all the way to your grow.
[22:05.640 --> 22:09.120]  Because the minute I put on my dunks, I start charging you extra money.
[22:09.120 --> 22:13.220]  If I'm driving to the facility, it costs you double what it costs for costs for me to do
[22:13.220 --> 22:15.240]  a consultation on zoom.
[22:15.240 --> 22:17.120]  That's just a business way of doing things.
[22:17.120 --> 22:21.160]  So you could save yourself half the money by having double the paperwork.
[22:21.160 --> 22:22.280]  Keep fucking notes.
[22:22.280 --> 22:25.240]  So I'm going to ask you, what did you spray these plants?
[22:25.240 --> 22:27.620]  What did you spray them before that?
[22:27.620 --> 22:32.080]  How many milliliters of whatever shit you sprayed on there was in there?
[22:32.080 --> 22:33.080]  Who applied it?
[22:33.080 --> 22:34.240]  Can we talk to them?
[22:34.240 --> 22:35.240]  Did you soak the plants?
[22:35.240 --> 22:37.200]  Did you just spray them till they're running off?
[22:37.200 --> 22:38.780]  Did you spray them with a mist?
[22:38.780 --> 22:41.960]  Did you spray them from the underside or did you spray them from the top?
[22:41.960 --> 22:44.640]  When you sprayed them, did you turn the lights off or turn the lights on?
[22:44.640 --> 22:46.240]  I've got questions.
[22:46.240 --> 22:48.480]  Hopefully you've got notes for those answers.
[22:48.480 --> 22:51.200]  Then I'm going to ask you, what did you feed these plants last?
[22:51.200 --> 22:52.760]  I want to know what you fed them.
[22:52.760 --> 22:53.760]  Every nutrient.
[22:53.760 --> 22:54.760]  What was the pH?
[22:54.760 --> 22:55.760]  What was the PPM or EC?
[22:55.760 --> 22:59.240]  Do you have a runoff chart that I can look at to see what looked like for the past three
[22:59.240 --> 23:02.300]  weeks until the week when shit went wrong?
[23:02.300 --> 23:04.080]  Those are the questions I'm going to want to ask.
[23:04.080 --> 23:06.600]  Then I'm going to ask you, what was the VPD?
[23:06.600 --> 23:10.040]  VPD can cause and solve so many problems.
[23:10.040 --> 23:11.160]  Temperature and humidity.
[23:11.160 --> 23:12.160]  Just like you, bro.
[23:12.160 --> 23:15.640]  If I put you outside for two weeks and made you just deal with shit, you'd be stressed
[23:15.640 --> 23:16.640]  out.
[23:16.640 --> 23:17.640]  You'd go through some problems.
[23:17.640 --> 23:18.640]  You need a good VPD.
[23:18.640 --> 23:19.640]  We can fix your whole life with the VPD issue.
[23:19.640 --> 23:22.280]  I'm going to ask you all those things.
[23:22.280 --> 23:23.560]  Have those notes.
[23:23.560 --> 23:26.100]  Those are the notes I recommend having for breeding.
[23:26.100 --> 23:28.120]  You said phenol hunt for breeding.
[23:28.120 --> 23:37.320]  Structure, shape, aroma, leaf size, color, trichome density, trichome size and shape.
[23:37.320 --> 23:40.840]  Some plants have long, skinny, tall trichomes.
[23:41.520 --> 23:44.160]  Some have shorter, thicker, fatter trichomes.
[23:44.160 --> 23:46.980]  In my opinion, you get a different buzz from those.
[23:46.980 --> 23:47.980]  Are you breeding?
[23:47.980 --> 23:49.160]  Are you growing to make concentrates?
[23:49.160 --> 23:52.400]  If you're going to make concentrates, you want the taller, skinnier trichomes.
[23:52.400 --> 23:54.080]  They come apart from the buds better.
[23:54.080 --> 23:59.200]  If you're going to manhandle your buds, maybe you want those shorter, thicker trichomes.
[23:59.200 --> 24:02.040]  Concentrate makers are going to have feedback and opinions on that.
[24:02.040 --> 24:03.040]  Cannot wait to hear it.
[24:03.040 --> 24:06.200]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[24:06.200 --> 24:10.120]  The notes that you would take, honestly, I got way far rambling into the weeds on that,
[24:10.720 --> 24:13.440]  but the notes are all about what are important to you.
[24:13.440 --> 24:14.880]  What matters to you?
[24:14.880 --> 24:17.880]  When it comes to your breeding, your growing, what do you want to know?
[24:17.880 --> 24:19.240]  What are you going to want to pay attention to?
[24:19.240 --> 24:20.600]  What are you going to want to document?
[24:20.600 --> 24:21.600]  I am excessive.
[24:21.600 --> 24:24.240]  I got some OCD in the grow room.
[24:24.240 --> 24:25.240]  That's why I'm here.
[24:25.240 --> 24:28.200]  I'm on a different ... I'm doing things on a different level because I've got a different
[24:28.200 --> 24:29.200]  passion.
[24:29.200 --> 24:30.200]  My brain is on that path.
[24:30.200 --> 24:31.560]  It's just what I do.
[24:31.560 --> 24:32.560]  It's what I think about.
[24:32.560 --> 24:34.520]  So do you want to be OCD about it?
[24:34.520 --> 24:36.720]  Do you want to take copious notes, ridiculous notes?
[24:36.720 --> 24:38.560]  Do you want to take just enough notes?
[24:38.560 --> 24:40.020]  Or you can not even take notes.
[24:40.020 --> 24:41.220]  That is up to you.
[24:41.220 --> 24:43.580]  If you've got a memory ... See, that's the thing.
[24:43.580 --> 24:45.500]  I like to smoke right before I work.
[24:45.500 --> 24:49.300]  I put on music, put on my favorite song, put on my favorite podcast.
[24:49.300 --> 24:53.220]  I got Joey Diaz cussing me out in my left ear, just fucking cruising.
[24:53.220 --> 24:55.820]  Take a couple dabs and go in there and I got Joey, what's up, cocksucker?
[24:55.820 --> 24:57.220]  We're going to grow some fucking weed today.
[24:57.220 --> 24:58.220]  I'm like, hell yeah, we are.
[24:58.220 --> 25:03.180]  So I take a couple dabs and go in and get all these marvelous ideas and shit.
[25:03.180 --> 25:06.500]  I think, oh, I'm going to do this and do this and then I'm going to feed the plants this.
[25:06.500 --> 25:09.380]  If I don't take fucking notes, I don't remember any of the marvelous ideas.
[25:09.740 --> 25:10.980]  I don't know what I did to the plants.
[25:10.980 --> 25:15.260]  So I take a lot of notes because I like to smoke dabs and I'm listening to Uncle Joey
[25:15.260 --> 25:19.460]  or some fish and I just don't remember a goddamned thing because I'm nice and high in there and
[25:19.460 --> 25:20.460]  I'm in the zone.
[25:20.460 --> 25:22.380]  So that's why I take a lot of notes.
[25:22.380 --> 25:25.180]  You should take notes on what is important to you.
[25:25.180 --> 25:30.340]  Sticky Randy, I rambled on about that question so you definitely got a good answer.
[25:30.340 --> 25:33.420]  If you've got any more questions, if I can dial that in for you a little bit better,
[25:33.420 --> 25:36.980]  send me some feedback because I do want to make sure I answer your questions thoroughly.
[25:36.980 --> 25:38.460]  I went overboard on that one, bro.
[25:38.460 --> 25:39.780]  Thank you for the great question.
[25:39.780 --> 25:41.660]  Thank you for the Patreon contribution.

[26:52.580 --> 26:53.860]  That's what I meant to say.
[26:53.860 --> 26:59.500]  What I wanted to say after that, if you visit the website, you will find the web store for
[26:59.500 --> 27:02.980]  I Regenetics merch like this cool IRIE Army t-shirt.

[27:13.780 --> 27:15.460]  seven vendors on there.
[27:15.460 --> 27:16.860]  Go check out the vendors.

[27:18.860 --> 27:19.860]  Don't miss it.
[27:19.860 --> 27:20.860]  IRIEgenetics.com.

[27:24.700 --> 27:26.540]  Go in there, type in your email address.
[27:26.540 --> 27:28.420]  I'll send you a newsletter about once a month.
[27:28.420 --> 27:29.900]  I try not to overload you.
[27:29.900 --> 27:31.340]  Sometimes I honestly forget.
[27:31.340 --> 27:35.300]  I'll send you a newsletter approximately once a month with updates on what's going on with
[27:35.300 --> 27:39.540]  IRIE Genetics, with the podcast, with some seed drops, maybe some special events.
[27:39.540 --> 27:41.260]  There is a special event coming up.
[27:41.260 --> 27:45.540]  I'm waiting for an email with an address and some times and some info for some links and
[27:45.540 --> 27:47.940]  shit like that so we can get you tickets.
[27:47.940 --> 27:49.940]  But until I've got that, I've just got to tease you about it.
[27:49.940 --> 27:54.540]  May 22nd, somewhere in Denver, there will be a seed selling, purchasing, exchanging
[27:54.540 --> 27:55.540]  event.
[27:55.540 --> 27:57.140]  I don't know the proper wording for that.
[27:57.140 --> 27:59.940]  But if you need seeds, come to Denver, May 22nd.
[27:59.940 --> 28:01.540]  We'll get you laced up with this event.
[28:01.540 --> 28:02.540]  I will be there.
[28:02.540 --> 28:04.180]  A lot of other great seed vendors will be there.
[28:04.180 --> 28:06.260]  We'll get you taken care of.
[28:06.260 --> 28:10.600]  But if you check out my website, join the newsletter, you will get updated info on that.
[28:10.600 --> 28:12.100]  You will not miss a thing.
[28:12.100 --> 28:13.100]  IRIEgenetics.com.
[28:13.100 --> 28:15.700]  That was the point of all that nonsense.
[28:15.700 --> 28:18.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this was a fun episode to record.
[28:18.180 --> 28:19.340]  I had a good time.
[28:19.340 --> 28:20.460]  Cut loose on the microphone.
[28:20.460 --> 28:22.180]  This is my Zen spot right here.
[28:22.180 --> 28:25.060]  Nobody can mess with me when I'm behind these lights and in front of this camera.
[28:25.300 --> 28:27.500]  Thank you for joining me in my sweet spot.
[28:27.500 --> 28:29.980]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[28:29.980 --> 28:33.500]  I want to give a giant shout out to my good friend, John Bendit.
[28:33.500 --> 28:36.980]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
